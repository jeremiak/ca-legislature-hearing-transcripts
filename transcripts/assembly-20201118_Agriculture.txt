TO LEARN ABOUT THE IMPACTS SUSTAINED BY CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE DUE TO. RECENT WILDFIRES. AND TO EXPLORE POLICIES NEEDED TO AVOID- AND MITIGATE THESE IMPACTS IN FUTURE YEARS. THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY IT HAS BEEN THE LARGEST MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASON EVER RECORDED IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY- THIS YEAR- AND JUST RECENTLY IN RECENT MONTHS WILDFIRES HAVE BURNED MORE THAN FOUR POINT ONE MILLION ACRES FOUR POINT ONE MILLION ACRES. THE AUGUST COMPLEX FIRE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE LARGEST FIRE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. BURNED OVER ONE MILLION ACRES. I IN FACT SIX OF THE TEN LARGEST RECORDED FIRES IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY HAPPENED JUST THIS YEAR. WHILE THESE FIRES HAVE RAGED IT SEEMS THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU RESIDED HERE IN OUR STATE. THERE WAS NO ESCAPING THEIR IMPACT. WE ALL SAW IT FROM THE DARKENED RED SKIES. TO THE CHARRED HILLSIDES A WE ALL STRUGGLED THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER WITH SEVERELY UNHEALTHY AIR. THAT SEEMS TO LINGER FOR MONTHS ON END- AND THE IMPACT AGRICULTURE. WAS ABSOLUTELY PROFOUND- IN ADDITION TO THE EXTREMELY TOXIC IMPACT OF WILDFIRE SMOKE ON WORKERS FRESH PRODUCE IN MY DISTRICT- AND ACROSS OUR STATE PRODUCE SUCH AS SPINACH LETTUCE STRAWBERRIES GRAPES. WERE EXPOSED TO ASH TO SMOKE AND COULD NOT BE HARVESTED. AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE THIS YEAR MORE THAN EVER. BORE A HEAVY TOLL A HEAVY TOLL. THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL LAND BURNED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH THE PRODUCING GRAPES RUINED. SO TODAY WE WILL BE HEARING FROM FARMERS- WILL BE HEARING FROM RANCHERS AND AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS. ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF RECENT WILDFIRES. WE WILL HEAR ABOUT THEIR IMPACT AND ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES- AND WHAT WE HOPE WE CAN DO TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF FUTURE WILDFIRES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS CLEAR CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES ARE NOT GOING AWAY. I AND WE MUST BE BETTER PREPARED FOR WHEN THEY RETURN. I AND IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT AGRICULTURE MUST BE A LEADER IN THIS DISCUSSION- AGRICULTURE MUST BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION IN MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES AND I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION HERE TODAY. I GIVE I'D LIKE TO GIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE WHO JUST JOINED US- AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY SOME COMMENTS. THAT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN WELCOME TO. BEING THE CHAIR OF AGRICULTURAL AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR. DOING YOUR STATEWIDE AGRICULTURAL TOUR WHEN HE GOT THE NEWS THAT YOU WERE- GIVEN THE POSITION AND COMING DOWN TO MY DISTRICT AND SPENDING TIME THERE AND- BEAN BOOTS ON THE GROUND- NO MEANS A LOT TO OUR- AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY TO SEE MEMBERS- ACTUALLY GET THEIR BOOTS DIRTY. AND YOU DID SHALL. ON ONE OF YOU FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER- IN IN COMMITTEE STAFF- VICTOR AND EVERYONE. YOU KNOW I THINK WITH THE- WILDFIRES AS A VAN AS THE CONTINUE TO GET WORSE REALLY LOOKING AT THE MITIGATION ASPECTS ON WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER- AND WE KNOW. THAT AGRICULTURE HAS THE ABILITY TO LEAD THE WAY AND THERE ARE A LOT OF MITIGATIONS WITHIN THE AG INDUSTRY THAT WE CAN DO THAT ARE ACTUALLY- PROTECT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION- TO OUR PANELISTS AND SHEDDING SOME MORE LIGHT ON WHAT IS TRUTHFULLY OUT THERE THAT CAN BE DONE. ON ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE GRAZING PRACTICES AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE MORE USE OF AND HOPEFULLY SHINE SOME MORE LIGHT ON- WHAT WE CAN DO IN THAT SPACE TO DO A BETTER JOB ACROSS THE STATE SO THANK YOU FOR. THE BIGGEST QUESTION LEVINE TO. I. THANK YOU MUCH MR AND THANK YOU AS WELL AS VICE CHAIR IT'S AMAZING TO THINK ABOUT THE AGRICULTURE- POWER. OF K. I'VE BEEN- FARMS BOTH IN. IN BOTH YOUR DISTRICTS TULARE AND MARK COUNTY AND OF COURSE IN CINEMA COUNTY- ACROSS THIS WHOLE. THE EACH. MIGHT THAT. REPRESENTS THE JOB IT RIGHT THE INSULAR. BENEFITS TO THE WHOLE STATE- THAT REPRESENTS THE FOOD PRODUCTION. THAT LANDS ON THE PLATE OF BOTH- SO MANY AMERICANS IN AND CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. IT TELLS A FANTASTIC STORY FOR CALIFORNIA. AND IT SO IT WOULD BE EASY. TOO EASY- REPRESENTING SOME COUNTY TO THINK I CAN WE JUST PLEASE STOP THESE WILDFIRES JUST BEEN TOO MANY FOR TOO MANY YEARS- BUT I KNOW EVERYONE ACROSS THE STATE. FEELS THE VERY SAME WAY IT'S A IT'S SOME OF THOSE AFFECTED THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND- IT ALONE IT'S AFFECTING THE ENTIRE CITY CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW IT'S AFFECTING AGRICULTURE. IN EVERY CORNER OF CALIFORNIA SO- I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD- AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING- WE CAN'T LET THAT LET LEFT AUSTIN AND LOOK BACK ON OUR FOCUS ON HOW. WILDFIRES ARE IMPACTING CALIFORNIA AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF ITS IMPACTS ON THE COMMUNITIES WHICH IS EVERY SINGLE PART OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. I THOSE COMMENTS AND CA AGREE MORE WITH- BUT CHAIR AND SOME OF OUR LIVE. WILL MOVE ON TO A FIRST PANEL FIRST INTO TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW. OF RECENT. IN OUR STATE AND THE IN. ON LIKE TO OUR FIRST PANEL. TO SEE. IF I MISSED YOUR NAME. APOLOGIZE. IT'S A CHEAP NICK SCHULER- HE'S THE- DEPUTY DIRECTOR CAN WITH CAL FIRE. WILL BE JOINING US FROM THE WITH VIDEO ROOMS. SO CHIEF WHEN YOU'RE READY TAKE IT AWAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NICK SCHULER AND I'M ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THE ISSUE OF WILDFIRE TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA. LIKE TO START BY TALKING ABOUT THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRE SEASON. WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS YEAR HAS BEEN AMONG THE MOST DAMAGING AND DESTRUCTIVE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. SO FAR WE HAVE HAD MORE THAN NINETY TWO HUNDRED WILDFIRES IGNITE. ACROSS THE STATE. WHICH COLLECTIVELY HAVE BURNED MORE THAN FOUR TWO POINT TWO MILLION ACRES DESTROYED OVER NINETY THREE HUNDRED STRUCTURES AND KILLED THIRTY TWO INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING THREE FIRST RESPONDERS. SIX OF THE TWENTY LARGEST WILDFIRES IN OUR HISTORY HAVE OCCURRED THIS YEAR INCLUDING THE MASSIVE AUGUST COMPLEX WHICH ALONE BURNED MORE THAN ONE MILLION ACRES ACROSS SIX COUNTIES. WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT THIS YEAR ASIDE FROM THE STAGGERING FIGURES IS A MOST LARGE FIRES HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF LIGHT. BEGINNING ON ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED FOURTEEN THOUSAND DRY LIGHTNING STRIKES OVER SEVERAL DAYS ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RESULTING IN NINE HUNDRED FIRES. CALIFORNIA HAS IT EXPERIENCED LIGHTNING SEEDS LIKE THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SIEGE ONLY HUB ABOUT A THIRD OF THE NUMBER OF LIGHTNING STRIKES THAT WE SAW THIS PAST AUGUST. THE MAN. I WHICH FIRE BURNED WELL UNPRECEDENTED. AND ACTIVISTS CAN THROUGH THE STATE. FROM THE CO. OF MONTEREY COUNTY TO OUTSKIRTS. OF QUINCY PLUMAS COUNTY TO THE NOT FOREST. AND TULARE CAN. WEEKS LATER A SET OF FIRES OCCURRED LABOR DAY WEEK FUELED BY HIGH TO. AND DR ED. REYES IN FOR DOWN. AND TO SHOW ACROSS OUR STATE. AT THE P. OF THIS YEAR C. MORE THAN NINETY THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS ARE BATTLING. ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WITH MANY OF THESE FIRES OCCURRING IN AREAS PREVIOUSLY DEVASTATED BY FIRE LIKE NAPA COUNTY. THIS SIEGE HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE SERVE. THIS YEAR RECORD FIRE SEASON IMPACTED JUST ABOUT EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE STATE INCLUDING THOSE FAR AWAY FROM THE FIRE PERIMETER. SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE EXPERIENCED RECORD UNHEALTHY AIR LEVELS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AND PROMPTED AUTHORITIES TO ISSUE SPARE THE AIR ALERTS. FOR AT LEAST THIRTY CONSECUTIVE DAYS. NATIONAL HEAR IN MORE DETAIL FROM OTHER WITNESSES IN TODAY'S HEARING THAT SAME WILDFIRE SMOKE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR CULTURE ACROSS THE STATE. CAL FIRE AND CDFA HAVE PRODUCED AN ONLINE MAP OVERLAYING CALIFORNIA'S FARMLANDS WHAT THE TWENTY TWENTY WILDFIRE PERIMETERS YEAH COMMITTEE STAFF HAS THE WIN. IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE AG TO THE- I. WANT TO. THIS YEAR SHOWS THAT Y. CAN AND DO OCCUR THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. FROM OREGON TO THE MEXICAN BORDER FROM THE OCEAN TO THE DESERT. WHILE WATER FIRST RIGHT PART OF OUR STATE'S LANCE. YES OF CHANGE FIRE SUPPRESSION ACTIVITIES. OVERGROWN FORESTS AND A PROLONGED DROUGHT HAVE RESULTED IN ON FOR SRI MORE. IN OUR FORESTS ELEMENTARY THE NEW SIZE AND SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE WITNESSED NINE ALMOST HALF OF THE TWENTY LARGEST FIRES IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. LOOKING BACK A BIT FURTHER SEVENTEEN OF THE TWENTY LARGEST WILDFIRES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. RECENTLY WILDFIRE TRENDS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT PEAK FIRE SEASON IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE WEST IS STARTING EARLIER AND ENDING LATER EACH YEAR. CLIMATE CHANGE IS A KEY DRIVER OF THIS TREND. WARMER SPRING AND SUMMER TEMPERATURES. REDUCED SNOWPACK AND EARLY EARLY SPRING SNOW GREATLY. AND MORE INTENSE SEASONS IS THAT INCREASE MORTGAGE STRESS. ON VEGETATE. AND FOR US AND OUR LANDSCAPES MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO WILD. CLIMA CHANGE IS AN IS ACTING AS A MORE. THE WAY INCREASING THINGS CAL WILD. OVER THE COME DECADE. WE CAN EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE LONGER FIRE SEASONS INCREASED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF DROUGHT GREATER ACREAGE BURNED A RELATED SECONDARY IMPACTS SUCH AS WIDESPREAD TREE MORTALITY AND BARK BEETLE INFESTATION. WELL IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE WILDFIRES ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOCUSED AND DELIBERATE ACTION CAN PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND IMPROVE FUELS CONDITIONS TO ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO BETTER COEXIST WITH WILDFIRE. ADOPTING A WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA'S DRY MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE REQUIRES A SYSTEMATIC. ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH. THIS MEANS IDENTIFYING AND MAPPING FIRE HAZARD AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ACTED A NEIGHBOR AND CAN. FROM WILDFIRE THROUGH LAN SCAPE SCALE YOUR- AND FOREST HEALTH. PLANNING COMMUNITIES THAT RE TO WHY. WITH FUEL BREAKS GREEN. YEAH AND AROUND THE CAN. ENSURING HAVE PROPER ABOUT ROUTES WATER SUPPLY AND FIRE RESOURCES. BILL HOMES AND RESIST BUT WELL MAIN THEIR FEET OF THE FOR SPACE BAR. DEAD AND OVER GROW VEGETATION AND EDUCATING THE TO PREVENT THE START AND SPREAD OF HUMAN BECAUSE WILDFIRES. IT IS A UNDERSTANDING NO END TASK OR PROGRAM IS A SILVER BULLET. AND EACH ONE OF THESE EFFORTS WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER TO PREVENT AND PROTECT AGAINST WILDFIRES. EACH REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT MUST BE ADOPTED FOR USE IN PARTICULAR AREAS BASED ON WEATHER PATTERNS. VEGETATION TYPES TOPOGRAPHY AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. CALIFORNIA'S PARTNERS ACROSS GOVERNMENT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO THIS ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH. WHICH WILL PUT CALIFORNIA ON A TRAJECTORY AWAY FROM INCREASINGLY DESTRUCTIVE FIRES AND TOWARD A MOVE. MODERATE YEAH MANAGEABLE REGIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FOR THE ANSWERING ANY YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU CHIEF AT THE SMALL I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GONNA RESERVE QUESTIONS INTEL- THE CONCLUSION OF THE PANEL IT'S ALL THE SPEAKERS. I HAVE A GUN THIS MOMENT- WOULD LIE TO INVITE OUR NET PANELIST IS. WHICH IS DOCKED DAN SUMNER. DIRECTOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL ISSUES I HE WILL BE JOINING US BY PHONE- MODERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR DOCTOR SUMNER. THANK YOU CHIEF. THIS IS DAN SUMMER DO YOU HEAR. YES WE CAN. MR SUMNER AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US AFTERNOON. RIGHT SO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC LOSSES TO ADD TO AGRICULTURE IN THE FIRST THING I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT- THE CONSEQUENCES THE ONCE WE REALLY- ALL DO IN AND NEED FOCUS OUR LOS APPLY ANSWER AND IN- INTEREST INDIVIDUAL. IT ALSO LOS THE HOME AND TRY THE REALLY IT TEMPAT TO PUT A MA LOSS AFTER SAY THAT. BECAUSE NOW I'M GONNA TURN TO A BUNCH OF DOLLARS DOLLAR LAW. BUT I NONE OF US CAN SIGHT OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY HAVE A VERY HARD TIME THINKING OF IN TERMS A DOLLARS AND CENTS. AND IT'S MANY OF THE FARM FAMILIES AND OPERATORS AND FORMER EMPLOYEES THERE ARE. THOSE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY TRAGIC LOSSES SO THIS IS ALSO AN AGRICULTURAL ISSUE BUT AGAIN IT'S ONE THAT I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO QUANTIFY THIS MORNING OR TIS AFTERNOON. WELL IT AND TO THE CHIEF. ONE OF THE THINGS AND I'LL COME BY TO THIS THE END I THINK. OF THIS YEAR- THERE I'M NOT GO BACK A COUPLE OF YEARS WERE WE CAN HAVE ALREADY SOME CAL. OF EAGLE LOSSES. BUT THE THINGS THAT WERE DIFFERENT THIS YEAR IS THE- WERE EARLY. COMPARED TO THE ONE IN STATE SO. AND. AND THAT THEY HAD SOME. OF UP AMONG. WAS THE SMOKE DAMAGE. NOT JUST IT. COURSE SMOKE DAMAGE- IS IN THREAT. TO HELP ON. DAYS IN THE LIKE. AND I JUST WANT TO SHOULD. MAKE THE THAT FORMER ARE AMONG THE- THAT ARE OUT THERE EVERY DAY. WORKING IN CAN. WE ALL KNOW WITH. THEY CAN BE. AND ALSO WITH THAT ERIC. AND YET. IF THE CROPS ARE GOING TO BE HARPER AT THE- OF ARE GOING TO. SOMEBODY'S TO BE OUT THERE DOING IT I WANT TO SEE. THAT YEAH I'LL SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME I HAVE NO QUAN OF THOSE. OF ECONOMIC Mà ARE THEY- WE KNOW HOW DO IT A- GOOD AT IT- IN BAR ECONOMY WORKING A GROUP. ECONOMIST BUT IT HAS BEEN DONE AS FAR AS I KNOW FOR A TWENTY TWENTY. OF FARMWORKER- IMPACT OF A BETTER QUALITY. ALL WE DO NOT YET HAVE A TO DATE ACCURATE ASSESS FOR TWENTY. THEREFORE WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS GO BACK. UP TO LOW AT IT WHAT WE'VE DONE SAY ON THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES WERE WEAK THERE HAS BEEN MORE CALCULATIONS DONE WITH OBJECTIVE DATA. AND SOME WELL WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE COMPLETE INFORMATION- AGGREGATE ASSESSMENTS ARE NEEDED OF COURSE AND- THEN THEY NEED TO USE OBJECTIVE MODELING AND DETAILED DATA. TO CALCULATE LOST INCOME AND WEALTH AND ALSO JOBS AND I THINK THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT EVEN THOUGH IT IS A SET OF FAIRLY DRY CALCULATIONS. WELL LET ME START WITH A COUPLE OF- FACTS AND FIGURES JUST TO PUT ALL OF THIS IN PERSPECTIVE. A CALIFORNIA'S PRODUCING ABOUT FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF AGRICULTURAL INCOME EVERY YEAR. THAT SALES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS- IT VERY TO GOES UP AND DOWN DEPENDING ON PRICES AND WHAT THE WEATHER GIVES US. ALL HOPE THAT ABOUT THE TWELVE POINT THREE BILLION IS PAID TO EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACT LABOR SO A BIG CHUNK OF THAT GOES TO THE WORKERS. ALL BUT DOT NET RETURNS TO FARMERS OR ABOUT TEN BILLION. AND THE REST GOES FOR A- ALL EXPENSES ON FORM SO THAT THE NET IS A LOT SMALLER THAN THE GROSS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE RESOURCE BASED ON THIS OF AG. DATA WHICH IS THE BEST WE HAVE WHICH IS TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH THE VALUE AND FARMLAND AND RANGE AND BUILDINGS AND THE LIKE MOST OF THAT LAND BUT OUR SISTER SUBSTANTIAL PART IS OTHER REALESTATE- BUILT REAL ESTATE. MACHINERY IS ABOUT. BILLION DOLLARS TERMS OF FARMLAND WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION ACRES ABOUT EIGHT MILLION OF THAT IS THE HARVESTED CROPLAND ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION AS PASTOR AND THEN THERE'S ADDITIONAL ACREAGE- AS WELL. BOB DRAWING THE LINE BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE REST THE COMMIES NOT EASY HERE I'M GONNA FOCUS WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME I'M GONNA FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON FARM LOSSES I'M NOT GOING TO PROVIDE DATA ON LOSSES IN PROCESSING AND MARKETING WE KNOW THAT PART OF AGRICULTURE IT IS VERY HARD TO SEPARATE AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING SAY FROM OTHER MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES FOOD PROCESSING IS OFTEN INCLUDED WITHIN AGRICULTURE BUT IT'S ALSO INCLUDED WITHIN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND I'M GONNA FOCUS ON SOME TWENTY SEVENTEEN NUMBERS TO GIVE US EXAMPLES TO WORK WITH. AND ALL START WITH VENTURA ALL WERE THE THOMAS FIRE WHICH AFFECTED NOT JUST BEEN TOUR BUT SURROUNDING AREAS AS WELL INCLUDING SANTA BABARA COUNTY ALL THE COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE MADE SOME ESTIMATES RIGHT AWAY ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OF PASTURE. ABOUT TENTH ACRES OF IRRIGATED CROPLAND IN THIS SORT OF PATTERN MOSTLY IT'S PAST YOUR LAND. IS TRUE FOR ALL THE WILDFIRES THAT I'VE LOOKED AT. OR ALMOST ALL OF THE BIG ONES. OUT THERE OF THE THOMAS FIRE THERE WERE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND ACRES OF AVOCADOS THAT WERE AFFECTED. ALSO CITRUS. THESE ARE VERY HIGH VALUE CROPS THAT ARE AFFECTED THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THAT THOMAS FIRE FIRE. THE COMMISSIONER ESTIMATED THE DIRECT AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC LOSS AT THE FARM LEVEL. AT ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION. AND THEN ESTIMATED ON ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION. IN AGRICULTURAL DWELLINGS AND THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT IS. FAIRLY GENERAL- CALIFORNIA MAKES A VERY GOOD ASSESSMENT OF STRUCTURES THAT ARE DAMAGED AND DWELLINGS THAT ARE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF MUCH OF THE DAMAGE THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE OF FIRES HAPPENS WITH THAT A DAMAGE TO STRUCTURES. BOB IN THE THOMAS FIRE THE WERE ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS EACH IN LAW. OF THE VALUE THE CROP THAT WERE AT ON THE TREES THAT WAS A CODE COTTO'S INSPECTOR. GIVEN THE TIME OF THE FAR IN THE TIME OF THE HEART. OF FAIRLY ON YOU. IN THE THAT MOST CROSS- SHARES THAT HAVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY MOST WOULD BE HARDEST. BY THE TIME I A FOR IN NOVEMBER. IT BUT THAT'S TRUE FOR CITRUS OF COURSE OR FOR A- THE CAPITAL. IN THE THOMAS FIRE WERE ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS. AND THAT WAS DAMAGE TO THE TREES THEMSELVES AS AN ASSET. AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURES OF THE BARNES AND FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT. AND THAT SORT OF PATTERN. OF IS QUITE BROAD. THE LOSS TO THE PASTURE LAND WAS RELATIVELY SMALL PER ACRE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SIXTY MILLION ACRES. THERE WERE FENCES AND STRUCTURES I DON'T SAY I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT WAS A SMALL NUMBER IT WAS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- BUT BUT PER ACRE. WELL WE KNOW THAT BURNING THE PAST YOUR LAND YOU'RE NOT DESTROYING A CROP GENERALLY AND PARTICULARLY IF IT'S IN THE FALL. ALL IT GROW BACK. AND I. OF THE LAW A FORMER IS NODDING IN WHAT THE CA. DID ALL THAT WAS VERY VALUABLE ESTIMATES RIGHT AFTER THE THOMAS FIRE. LET ME TURN IN. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA QUICKLY. OF THE NORTH BAY FIRE OF TWO SEVEN- COURSE IN THE NORTH BIG SAN WAS HIT NAPA SLAW- A LAY MENACING ALL OF THEM ALL THE WAY UP. IT ALSO IN THIS VALLEY BUTTE YUBA K. ABOUT FIVE EIGHT THERE THE ABOUT TWO OR TWO THAT YEAR IN THE NORTH BAY. MUCH OF THAT WE- RANGING A PATH. DAMAGE TO FENCES STRAW FACILITY EQUIPPED. ALL CALCULATION ARRIVED SIXTY WAS A TEN DOLLARS IF YOU THINK OF THE ECRI IN THE AMOUNT OF FENCING STRUCTURE THAT WERE GOING ALONG THAT HELLO IT'S- WE WERE BURNING ACROSS SO YOU LOSE THAT. IN THE GREAT WAS PRETTY COME BY THE TIME ALL THE YEAR WAS OVER IN THE- OF FOR WILL COME BACK IN THIS. BUT THE BIGGEST LOSS WILL TREASON FIND AND THEIR PART- LEVINE- SO EXT VOTE VICE PER ACRE LIVING LAND. IT'S OFTEN CAL. IN THE BEST WAY TO CAL IT IS SAY WHAT THE LAND WORKED WITH VINEYARD. WHAT PLAN WHAT THE BARE LAND WORTH THE YOU CAN. ON AND THAT TELLS YOU THE DIFFERENT IN IT IN THE RAIN OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND IN IN- THE AVERAGE FOR NAPA COUNTY IN SOME LESS PER RE SIX GET DOWN TO TWENTY A I USE FOR SOME **** OF FIFTY TO EIGHT FOR THE FOR THE AREA- FORTY. VINES ARE RE TO FIVE. BUT EVEN IF THE VINES OKAY. ARE YOU CAN BURN EXPENSIVE TROUBLES AND IRRIGATION SO. ALL PUTTING THE IN THE CAR. THERE WERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED OF OUR WITHIN THE FIRE. USING THEM. THAT CAL. SO YOU GET A LOT OF ABOUT TWO FIVE. OF THE ACRES OF FIVE AND- NOW IN FARM- GOOD LOSSES. A WHINER STRUCTURE IN OTHER. AND I HAVEN'T INCLUDE THOSE SO AND THEY'RE PROBABLY AT LEAST AS LONG AS THE LOS OF TO THE THING THEMSELVES. WELL DOCTOR PROBABLY I SAW I HAVE TO CUT YOU OFF THERE TO REALLY APPRECIATE. WE SURE WHAT SOME. AT THE BUT WE ARE WERE UP THE TIME BUT REAL PRETTY YOUR TIME AND ALL THE INFORMATION. ALL OF. YEAH I'LL STAY ON THE LINE IN CASE THERE. THANK YOU DON AND SO AT THIS TIME OF THE FOR. SPEAKER ON THIS PANEL. WILL BE FROM CDFA. A DEPUTY SAID. ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE AT THE DEPARTMENT- KEVIN. MASSIEU HARA- MR MASAHARU IF I MISPRONOUNCE A NAME AGAIN I APOLOGIZE BUT- YOU ARE UP WHEN YOU'RE READY TO GO. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN RIVAS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- YEAH YOU'RE PRETTY CLOSE KEVIN LAWSUIT ARE AT SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG- MY ARA IS THE ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE- YEAH THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I'M GOING TO PRESENT HERE TODAY TO UPDATE YOU ON RELATED TO THE WILDFIRES. OF THE FIRST ONE IS THE FAIR GROUNDS BECAUSE THEY PLAY A PRETTY IMPORTANT ROLE WE HAVE DISASTERS SUCH AS WILDFIRES. IN THE SECONDARY WILL BE SPECIFIC TO THE ANIMAL CARE PROGRAM WHICH IS A PROGRAM HOUSED AT OUR DEPARTMENT. I'M BY WAY OF OVER OF THE- NETWORK OF FAIR ARE SO SEVEN TOTAL AND CAL. AND THERE'S VERY ANSWER THERE IS STRUCTURE THAT WERE. GOVERN HOW THESE VERY ARE YOU THAT ALL OF THEM GET. IN DUTY WHEN THE DURING. VANCE. AND FOR THE PERIOD WORK A- FIFTY DE FARES ARE. FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE DURING WHILE SEE. AND I'LL GIVE YOU A ROUGH BREAK OF THAT OF HOW THE WERE YOU TO. THIRTY THREE OF THEM WERE IN THE SHOW OF THE- TWENTY TWO USED AS A VACUUM SITE. AND TWENTY ONE WERE USED AS STAGING COME CENTER ARE BASED- MATH ON THAT DOES ADD UP TO SAID BECAUSE MANY OF THESE FAIRGROUNDS ARE LOW PROPER. AND SO THEY ARE MULTI PURPOSE AND SO THEY MOM MORE ONE ROLE DURING A. AND DURING THE PERIOD THERE WERE. ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND. WERE SHELTERED AT THE FAIR. AND CLOSE THREE THOUSAND ABOUT. WERE HOUSED AT FAIRGROUNDS DURING THE PERIOD. AND OVER TWENTY TWO. MERGING WAS FIRST. GRASPING THIS PERIOD SO. IT'S CAN SEE THE- OF VITAL TO THE RESP. AND HELPING TO SUPPORT THE RESPONSE. AND WHEN YOU DO THIS- A THOROUGH COLLECTIVE. ON THESE VERY GROUNDS WERE A THEIR THEIR UTILIZE FOR TOLD OF NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT DAYS DURING THIS YOU KNOW SO THAT'S A PRETTY SUB COME AT LEAST GROUND FOR THE FIRST OF. I TO THE ANIMAL CARE IS I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THROUGH THIS HEARING I'LL TRY TO KEEP THIS ONE BRIEF AS WELL THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT. THAT'S GOING TO SERVE THIS COMMITTEE- TOO WELL SO WE CAN GET INTO THAT LATER IF YOU DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE ANIMAL CARE Z. AS IT STANDS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL RESPONSE EMERGENCY SYSTEM AND THAT'S A STATEWIDE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS ANIMALS IN DISASTERS. AND HERE IS A SUPPORTED BY A PARTNERSHIP OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT COMMIT RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE TO PREPARING FOR. AND RESPONDING TO ANIMALS IN DISASTERS. BERSEDIA BASIL AND CARERS WE STEP THIRTY NINE RESPONSE POSITION ROTATIONS TO SUPPORT COUNTY ANIMAL SERVICES AND WE HAD A DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTER THAT ACTIVATED FOR THE MAJOR FIRES DURING TWENTY TWENTY- IN CARRYING THIS OUT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AT CALLOWAY YES. TO FACILITATE THE COUNTY'S REQUEST FOR MISSION TASKING STATE RESOURCES REQUEST FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE AND STATE TO STATE MUTUAL AID REQUEST FOR RESOURCES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT. CDFA ALSO DEPLOYED A PARCEL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM TO STAFF THE BUTTE COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER FOR THE NORTH COMPLEX FIRE WITH CONTINUOUS SUPPORT FOR FOUR WEEKS. CDFA ALSO DEPLOYED STAFF TO TRINITY COUNTY TO ASSESS THE RECOVERY EFFORTS. IN THE AREAS OF ANIMAL MORTALITY MANAGEMENT LIVESTOCK HERE FEEDING NEEDS THEIR- AND JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THE BACKGROUND I TOLD I WOULD GET TOO DEEP INTO IT BUT TEARS BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN- BUT OVER THE YEARS. THE RESOURCE LEVELS HAVE VARIED AND WE'RE SUBJECT TO BUDGET CUTS ABOUT A DECADE AGO BUT DURING THE LAST FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET WE WERE SEATED- THREE PERMANENT POSITIONS HANG OUT. SOME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO STAFF UP AND THEY HAVE DEDICATED STAFF TO THIS. AB RIGHT HERE AND SO WE'VE COMPLETED- THE HIRES OF THOSE THREE FOLKS WITH LEVERAGE THAT TO TRAIN OTHER PEOPLE. THROUGHOUT ORGANIZATION AND CDFA TO BE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE IN THE- IDYLLWILD FIRE BUT ANY OTHER TYPE OF SITUATION WHERE ANIMAL CARE. IS NECESSARY. AND WITH THAT I'LL GO HEAD AND STOP THERE I KNOW THAT YOU WERE HOLDING QUESTIONS BACK FOR THE ENTIRE PANEL AT ONCE AND SO WE CAN MOVE INTO THAT PICTURE PLEDGE MISTER CARE. WHAT YOU. MR- MUSCLE HARA AND SO AT THIS TIME- THIRTY QUESTIONS OF FOR OUR FIRST PANEL- NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO ASK. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. AND EVERYTHING NOW IF YOU GET OKAY I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ACTUALLY- THE FIRST PROBABLY SHOULD BE FOR- CAL FIRE- JUST FOR A- CHIEF SURE- AND I KNOW JEAN FULLER YOU HAD MENTIONED IN YOUR STATEMENTS THAT WHAT WE CAN EXPECT IN FUTURE MONTHS AND YEARS WHEN IT COMES TO WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA IS GREATER ACREAGE WILL BE BURNED. AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE CURRENT INTERACTION OR THE POTENTIAL FOR INTERACTION OF CAL FIRE AND AGRICULTURE. YET WE KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTION PLANNING- AND HOW AGRICULTURAL LANDS. MAY PLAY A ROLE- A SIGNIFICANT ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO THE MITIGATION OF- WILDFIRE AS AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF. THIS REALLY TIES AND BEFORE DURING AND AFTER AN INCIDENT IN BEFORE AN INCIDENT OCCURS EACH OF OUR MEMBERS OF OUR DEPARTMENT OUR MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY MEET WITH LANDOWNERS COMMITTEES TO LOOK AT SPECIFIC INCIDENTS SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST. WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. DURING THE INCIDENTS OUR LIAISON STAFF IS ALSO MEETING WITH WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY DETERMINE AREAS OF AS AN EXAMPLE THAT NEED TO BE WATERED THAT ARE IN. OF ACTUATION AREAS AREAS THAT NEED TO BE HARVESTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHILE WE'RE EVACUATING PEOPLE WHAT WE ARE ALSO NOT DOING IS IMPACTING- THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS EVEN GREATER THAN WHAT THEY ALREADY ARE. ADDITIONALLY SENATE BILL NINE OH ONE PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THE LOOKS OF FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAMS. TO DETERMINE. AND MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING COLLECTIVELY AS A STATE TO PREPARE LANDSCAPE. EXCELLENT I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE CHIEF- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL AND SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS PANEL- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS MAKE THE TIME FOR US IN THIS REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC. THANK YOU. AND SO NOW FOR OUR SECOND PANEL- THE FOCUS THE FOCUS OF THIS PANEL IS GOING TO BE ON SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES TO AGRICULTURE- FROM GROWERS RANCHERS AND FARM WORKERS- I'D LIKE TO LIKE TO INVITE OUR OUR FIRST PANELISTS TO SPEAK MISTER JAIME JO HANSON IS PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. NOW HE'S HERE IN PERSON MR JOHANNSSON WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SCRIPTS YOU. AND CLARIFICATION WHERE DOES HE GET THIS IS A STEP HERE TO COME TO THE TABLE. OKAY YOU GOT WHATEVER YOU PREFER. YEAH HE- BECAUSE THE TABLE WORKS. GOOD AFTERNOON. YEAH MAYBE PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU JIM IF YOU LOWER THE MICROPHONE LITTLE BIT LONG TIME SINCE WE ARE IN THE CAPITAL EVERYTHING GOING ON THERE'S A TALK WITH YOU ABOUT WILDFIRES I AM JIM JOHANNSON PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION THE STATE'S LARGEST AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILY FARMERS AND RANCHERS I'M ALSO FORMER BUTTE COUNTY. CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES A VERY PERSONAL TO ME NOT AS PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU OR MY ORGANIZATION BUT BECAUSE MY FAMILY AND MY NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN EVACUATED THROUGHOUT THE LAST FOUR YEARS. FOR WILDFIRES. I WEREN'T AS MY TEST MY TO FOCUS ON THREE COMPONENTS. OF THE STATE'S WELFARE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE THE DIRECT IMPACT. THOSE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR LIVESTOCK BURNED TO DEATH OUR WINERIES AND VINEYARDS THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED OUR MEMBERS FOR THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO PICK UP. THE PIECES OF WHAT REMAINS. OF THEIR OPERATION. OUR MEMBERS. ARE FARMERS AND RANCHERS BUT SOME ARE ALSO WILDFIRE VICTIMS. THE INDIRECT IMPACT ALSO IS THE FOCUS OF WHICH WILL BE ON THE IMPACTS NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTLY FROM A WILDFIRE BUT RELATED TO IT SUCH AS SMOKE TAINT. FOR EXAMPLE AND IMPACTS TO OUR EMPLOYEES. OTHER RELATED A RESIDUAL IMPACTS TO AGRICULTURE THE INABILITY OF OUR FARMS TO ACQUIRE INSURANCE NOT FOR CROPS OR CROP DAMAGE BUT IN ORDER TO PRESERVE OUR BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE THE UNRELIABLE DELIVERY ELECTRICITY BECAUSE OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS AND THE INABILITY TO SAFELY EVACUATE ANIMALS WHEN COMMUNITIES FACE EVACUATION. THESE ARE THE THREE COMPONENTS THAT NO OTHER ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIA FACES. AND THESE ARE REAL CHALLENGES TO WHICH THE STATE NEEDS TO MEET. HEAD ON. THE FARM YOUR FAMILY COLLECTIVELY WITH OUR COUNTY FARMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSS JUST LIKE ALL CALIFORNIANS A COMMUNITIES REELING FROM THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. WITH GREATER REGULARITY THESE WILDFIRES AND NO LONGER STRONG JUST HOMES AND DEVASTATING COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA'S FARMS RANCHES EMPLOYEE HOUSING EQUIPMENT AND A ROCK COMMODITIES HAVE BEEN DAMAGED OR COMPLETELY DESTROYED. THESE WILDFIRES DON'T DISCRIMINATE AND ARE IGNORANT TO JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS CALIFORNIA BURNED MORE THAN FOUR MILLION ACRES OF LAND THIS YEAR. THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRES IN NAPA COMPLETELY DESTROYED BURGESS CELLARS CAIN VINEYARD DUTCH HENRY WINERY AND SURE ONE FAMILY VINEYARD ALL FARM BUREAU MEMBERS. AND ANOTHER TEN OPERATIONS AND DOZENS MORE IN CINEMA COUNTY WERE ALSO DESTROYED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NEARLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FROM CINEMA COUNTY FARMERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY USDA'S FARM SERVICE AGENCY. REQUESTING ASSISTANCE RELATED TO FIRE THE WILDFIRE DAMAGES AND THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMODITIES. IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA'S FARMING RANCHING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HURTING FARMER ALSO REPRESENTS TIMBER FAMILIES AND THE WILDFIRES THAT DESTROYED VIABLE COMMERCIAL TIMBER ACROSS THE STATE. IN DOING SO NOT ONLY HARMS THESE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS BUT ALSO ASSOCIATED MILLS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT STILL RELY ON THESE REVENUES. THOSE JOINING ME TODAY WILL TELL YOU OF THEIR EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE GRUESOME. SOME OF IT HORRIFIC. BUT IT'S THE REALITY IT'S A SOMBER REMINDER OF HOW CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS DIFFERENT AND HOW THE INABILITY OF RESPONSIBILITY AGENCIES TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY THE LIVESTOCK. HAS RESULT IN ARGUABLY AVOIDABLE TRAGEDY. THE TOTAL WILDFIRE DAMAGES ARE STILL BEING CALCULATED BUT EARLY ESTIMATES HAVE TO HAVE IT PEGGED AT APPROXIMATELY TEN BILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS A TOTAL ESTIMATE OF DAMAGE NOT SPECIFIC JUST TO AGRICULTURE. AS MENTIONED CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE ALSO FACES INDIRECT WILDFIRE CHALLENGES. THIS YEAR THE CHALLENGE WAS WILD FIRE SMOKE AND ASH WE ALSO FACE THE CHALLENGES RELATED TO PROVIDING OUR EMPLOYEE WITH PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT GIVEN THE EXISTING SHORTAGES RESULTING FROM COVE IN NINETEEN. THE ALLEN YOU COMPLEX FIRE COVERED MUCH OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA'S WINE REGION IN A WEEKS LONG BLANKET OF SMOKE AND ASH. ONLY TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE GLASS FIRE WHICH BURNED IN NAPA AND SONOMA COUNTIES THAT WILL LIKELY ACT AS THE KNOCKOUT PUNCH. FOR THE WINERIES LOOKING TO PRODUCE A TWENTY TWENTY MANAGE. IT'S REPORTED THAT THE GLASS FIRE COULD RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES WHAT CROP DAMAGE- FROM SMOKE AND ASH RELATED TO THE ELLEN YOU COMPLEX WILL POTENTIALLY BE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SMOKE AND ASH WASN'T CONFINED JUST TO WINE GRAPE GROWING REGIONS OF NAPA SONOMA. AND MENDOCINO COUNTIES. MONTEREY COUNTY CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL COAST COUNTIES THE WINE GRAPE GROWING REGIONS OF THE CENTRAL SACRAMENTO VALLEY ALSO EXPERIENCED WEEKS OF SMOKE AND ASK ASH COVERAGE. THE WILDFIRE SMOKE AND ASH FURTHER EXASPERATED THE EXISTING SHORTAGES RELATED TO THE AVAILABILITY OF PP THE PAST IT THIS PAST APRIL FARM BUREAU SURVEYED OUR MEMBERSHIP TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF THE IMPACT OF COLLUDED NINETEEN WAS HAVING ON THE FARM. NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT. REPORTED THAT THE UNAVAILABILITY OF N. NINETY FIVE RESPIRATORS AND OTHER PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES. WAS PREVENTING EVEN MOST USUAL ACTIVITIES USUAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS HARVEST PLANTING AND CULTIVATION FROM HAPPENING. FARMERS WERE UNABLE TO SOURCE AND NINETY FIVES ANOTHER PP FOR PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. THE EARLY ONSET OF THE WILDFIRE SEASON MADE THE NEED AND SHORTAGE MORE ACUTE. ACCORDING TO CAL OSHA WORKPLACE REGULATIONS EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO PROTECT OUTDOOR WORKERS WITH N. NINETY FIVE MASKS OR RESPIRATORS WHEN AIR QUALITY INDEX IS A HUNDRED FIFTY ONE OR GREATER. THE MOST CURRENT SITUATION SHOWS THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY BY STATE REGULATORS. THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRE SEASON COUPLED WITH THE UNAVAILABILITY OF N. NINETY FIVE RESPIRATORS DUE TO COVE IT. CAL OSHA HADN'T APPROVED ANYTHING THAT SERVES AS AN ALTERNATIVE. SORE EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE IN MARCH WHEN WE TOLD THE AGENCY THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. PRIOR TO THE WILD FIRES FARM BUREAU AND OTHER GROUPS WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO ACQUIRE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF MILLION RESPIRATORS. THAT WERE RELEASED TO THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS COMMISSIONERS FROM THE STATE SUPPLIES. BUT AS THE WILDFIRES BEGAN PEOPLE WHO NEED THE RESPIRATORS COULDN'T GET HIM. IN THE MEANTIME WE NEED ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES TO N. NINETY FIVE RESPIRATORS. UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS RESOLVED. OR A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT THE STATE SET ASIDE A SUFFICIENT STOCKPILE OF IN NINETY FIVE FOR EVERY WILDFIRE SEASON TO HELP FACILITATE DISTRIBUTION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA'S FARM RANCH EMPLOYEES. AND OTHER RELATED WILDFIRE IMPACT OUR CULTURE THE ASSEMBLY AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME HERE OF AN EMERGING ISSUE FACING CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS. CALIFORNIA'S FAIR PLAN THE TOUTED INSURER OF LAST RESORT FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND HOMEOWNERS WILL NOT INSURE CALIFORNIA'S FARMS AND RANCHES. EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW SPECIFICALLY INSURANCE CODE ONE ZERO ZERO NINE FOUR PROHIBITS PREMIUMS FOR AUTOMOBILE OR FARM RISK. IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE FARM RISK IS MORE LIKE PRODUCTION RISK. OR MARKET RISK OR FINANCIAL RISK INSTITUTIONAL RISK IN HUMAN OR PERSONAL RISK IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS WHY MOST FARMING OPERATIONS CARRY CROP INSURANCE AND PROVIDE BALANCE MANAGEMENT THAT REDUCE FINANCIAL AFFECTS THAT CAN RESULT FROM SUCH UNCERTAINTIES. THE FAIR PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE PREMIUMS RELATED TO CROP INSURANCE WE AGREE WITH THAT. BUT IT SHOULD COVER OUR FARMING AND RANCHING INFRASTRUCTURE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. RESOLVING THIS ISSUE AS A PRIORITY FOR MY ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIA DID NOT RESOLVE THE INSURANCE CRISIS THIS YEAR AND TEMPORARY MORATORIUMS IS ALSO NOT A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION EITHER. BUT WHAT CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND RANCHERS NEED IS AVAILABILITY AND CURRENTLY THAT IS SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE. THE AFFORDABILITY OF INSURANCE AND POLICY TERMINATIONS HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC AS WELL AS HAVE. WE'VE BEEN INFORMED BY OUR MEMBERS THAT PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED FROM 800-023-6000 DOLLARS ON A POLICY HOLDER. MEANWHILE SPECIALLY FOR THOSE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NAPA CINEMA EL DORADO CALAVERAS PLASTER AS WELL AS AN EVENT SHASTA. POLICIES ARE TERMINATED ENTIRELY DUE TO WILDFIRE RISKS. AS FAR AS PERSONAL SAFETY. THE SARS PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWNS CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN FORCED TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF WILDFIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS SUCH AS PSP SHUTDOWNS. INCREASING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS TO BE A PROTOCOLS VALUABLE TOOLS TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. WHILE P. S. P. SHUT DOWNS WAS CONDUCTED ON A MUCH MORE LIMITED SCALE AND DURATION THIS YEAR IT CREATES ADDED UNCERTAINTIES FOR AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. IN THE P. S. P. EVENTS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FARM BUREAU MEMBERS ON THE NORTH COAST FOUND THEMSELVES OF ELECTRICITY FOR FIVE DAYS OR MORE. FOR ANNA **** AGO FARMER- IN MENDOCINO AND DAIRY OPERATOR SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO THERE WAS NO BACKUP POWER FOR HER MILKING OPERATION NO POWER TO RUN THE MILKING EQUIPMENT. IT ALSO IS ALSO NO POWER FORK IS A ALSO MEANT NO POWER FOR HER- MILK TANKS IN HER COLD STORAGE FOR FIVE DAYS SHE PUMPED AND DUMPED. IT'S DEVASTATING FOR THESE OPERATIONS THAT ALREADY OPERATE ON THIN FINANCIAL MARGINS. SB SHUTDOWNS ADVANCE ALSO PREVENT FARMERS AND RANCHERS FROM BEING ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR OWN PROPERTIES AND NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MARIA FIRE IN VENTURA COUNTY IS ONE PRIME EXAMPLE. JOHN GREATER HONOR GREATER FARMING COMPANY WHICH MANAGES RANCHO TRES LOMAS FOR PARTNERSHIP NEAR SO MUCH CALIFORNIA HAD APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE ACRES OF MATURE AVOCADO TREES DESTROYED. AND APPROXIMATELY TWO ACRES OF NEWLY PLANTED LEMONS. DUE TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON'S- PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN PRACTICE THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO IRRIGATE THE TREES BEFORE THE FIRE STARTED WHICH WOULD HAVE WHAT OF THE SOIL AND LEAF LITTER. POTENTIALLY SUPPRESSING THE FIRE SPREAD. FURTHER DUE TO THE POWER SHUT DOWN DURING THE FIRE THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FILL THEIR OWN WATER TRUCKS AND STOP THE SPREAD THE FIRE NOR THE ABLE TO SATISFY THEIR QUEST TO FIRE OFFICIALS. WHO WHO DESIRED ADDITIONAL WATER FROM THE AGRICULTURAL WATER WELLS WHEN IT WAS OVER FARM LOSSES APPROX. TOTALED APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN IT COMES AMENDED BENJAMIN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND RANCHERS CONTINUE TO FACE ANOTHER CHALLENGE OVERLY AGGRESSIVE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT GOALS FROM THE UTILITIES. WHILE THE STATE HAS FORCED UTILITIES TO FOCUS EFFORTS ON MITIGATING WILDFIRE RISK THEIR FOCUS CONTINUES TO BE MISPLACED. IGNITION FROM THESE WILDFIRES IS NOT DUE TO A TRANSMISSION OR DISTRIBUTION LINE COMING INTO CONTACT WITH AN- ALMOND TREE. YET SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB NINE OH ONE THOUSANDS OF TREES HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM SHE GO TO BAKERSFIELD TO ENSURE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF ELECTRICAL SERVICE. MEANWHILE WE STILL HAVE THOUSANDS OF MILES OF ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE WILD URBAN INTERFACE. AND HIGH FIRE SEVERITY AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AT GREATER RISK OF POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. THESE FIRES ARE NOT STARTING IN AGRICULTURAL ORCHARDS BUT OUR ORCHARDS CONTINUE TO BE STUMPED SO THAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT GOALS CAN BE ATTAINED WITHOUT NECESSARILY DECREASING WILDFIRE RISK. IN A FEW MINUTES YOU ALSO HEAR TESTIMONY FROM DR DAVE DALY. HIS STORY COULD EASILY BE REPLICATED IN ANY COMMUNITY LOCATED WITHIN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA FACES ENORMOUS CHALLENGES FROM THESE WILDFIRES ONE HAS. ONE HAS BEEN ACTUALLY NEGLECTED AND THAT INVOLVES PROTECTION OR EVACUATION OF LIVESTOCK FROM A WILDFIRE. OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS NEED THE ABILITY TO CROSS INTO EVACUATION ZONES TO RELOCATE IMPERILED ANIMALS. THIS SHOULDN'T A DISCUSSION NOT ALLOWING US TO DO SO IS CONDEMNING OUR ANIMALS TO DEATH AND POTENTIAL'S POTENTIAL SUFFERING IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE WE CAN SAFELY HUMANELY AND EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT OUR ANIMALS TO SAFETY. HIRED VENDORS WORKING FOR CAL FIRE OR THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE ON ANY ACTIVE WILDLAND FIRE INCLUDE WATER TENDER OPERATORS HEAVY EQUIPMENT. OPERATORS THOSE ARE OPERATORS TRUE BUS DRIVERS TO CHAINSAW OPERATORS ALL REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE FIRE LINE SAFETY AWARENESS COURSE I WANT AT A ONE DAY EIGHT HOUR COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. GIVE US THE SAME OPPORTUNITY WE'RE PROFESSIONAL JUST LIKE THOSE VENDORS ALLOW US TO TAKE A CERTIFICATION COURSE RELATIVE TO WILDLAND FIRE SAFETY SO THAT WE CAN BE CERTIFIED TO WORK WITH IN AN EVACUATION ZONE. TO SAFELY RELOCATE OR TEND TO OUR LIVESTOCK. IF I COULD ON MY CONCLUDING REMARKS THANK YOU MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF MY ORGANIZATION. I THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU THIS AFTERNOON. CALIFORNIA HAS FACED UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES IN TWENTY TWENTY. AS HAVE ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT WE MUST REMAIN COMMITTED TO FINDING SOLUTIONS WELL BOND FUNDS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS ANOTHER REVENUES ARE CERTAINLY HELPFUL IT'S NOT THE PANACEA THE STATE NEEDS STRUCTURAL REGULATORY CHANGES TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN TREATING APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE MILLION ACRES IDENTIFIED. BY CAL VTP. CALIFORNIA HAS A GOAL TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF AGITATION TREATMENTS AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR. ON NON FEDERAL LANDS TO BE TREATED TO FULLY TREAT TWENTY ONE MILLION ACRES OF LAND AT A GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR IT'LL TAKE FORTY TWO YEARS. CALIFORNIA MUST DO BETTER AND MUST BE MORE EFFICIENT. MAKE NO MISTAKE CALIFORNIA IS PLAYING CATCH UP TO A SITUATION THAT HAS BEEN WORSENING FOR DECADES. AND HAS BEEN EXASPERATED BY DROUGHT DISEASE. AND EVEN CLIMATE CHANGE. THANK YOU. MR HASN'T REALLY APPRECIATE- THE TESTIMONY AT THE OF THE PANEL WE HAVE QUESTIONS WILL COME BACK TO BACK UP. THANK YOU. LIKE TO INVITE ONCE WE- DO SANITATION PROTOCOLS I'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR NEXT PANELIST TO SPEAK MISTER EDDIE CAMPOS FROM NO BOUNDARIES FARM BELIEVE HE'S GONNA BE HERE TO TESTIFY IN PERSON. AND. MISTER CAMPUS WHEN YOU'RE READY. AND YOU HAVE A CHOICE YOU COULD JUSTIFY THEIR STANDING OR HERE ON THE TABLE. OKAY. GOOD THANK YOU MY NAME IS EDDIE CAMPOS- I AM A HEMP FARMER FROM MY SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA I OWN A FARM CALLED NO BOUNDARIES FARM WERE FAMILY OWNED WERE LOCALLY GROWN THE REASON I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS INDUSTRY- I HAD A SICK MOTHER WHO WAS GIVEN A FEW MONTHS TO LIVE AND NOW THE DOCTOR SAID THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD DO. I DIDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAID SO I GOT MY MOM TAKEN CBD OILS AND ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT NATURAL STUFF. I'VE FOUGHT AGAINST THEM DOCTORS AND MY MOTHER- END UP LIVING AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTEEN MONTHS. FROM THIS PRODUCT- THIS IS MADE FROM HEMP SO THE PRODUCT IS AMAZING SO WHAT IT DID IT FORCE ME INTO. GETTING THE FARM AND GROWING MY OWN HOME BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED ON THE MEDICINAL SIDE OF WITH THIS. PRODUCT CAN DO. UNFORTUNATELY ON AUGUST SEVENTH OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY I LOST MY MOTHER. SEVENTEEN MONTHS AFTER THE DOCTOR SAID SHE HAD NO LONGER TO LIVE. ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY MY SON TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER. AS I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A RE DOING ONE OF OUR STRUCTURES TO HAVE MY MOM SERVICES- MY SON TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID THAT. CAN YOU LOOK OUT IN THAT FIELD OUT THERE I LOOKED OUT THERE AND I SEEN A FIRE STARTING THIS IS WHAT TO THIRTY NINE IN THE AFTERNOON ON SATURDAY. SEPTEMBER FIFTH. I'M LIKE SON EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY- WE'RE JUST GOING TO CALL NINE ONE ONE AND WE DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY SO WE GUESS ALL WENT BACK IN. TO DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING- HEMP FARMING. ALL ROUND THREE THIRTY THE FIRE GOT BIGGER FOUR THIRTY I GOT BIGGER. WE HAD NO AIR SUPPORT WE HAD NO GROUND SUPPORT IT WAS MY SON. MYSELF IN A COUPLE OF HIS FRIENDS. AND OUR MINDSET ORIGINALLY IS THEY'RE GONNA HELP US WE GOT AIR SUPPORT GROUND SUPPORT ONCE WE REALIZED THERE WEREN'T COMING. OUR WHOLE MINDSET CHANGE WE HAD TRACTORS ON THE PROPERTY. WE HAD GENERATORS TO RUN OUR WELLS BUT WE DIDN'T GRAB NONE OF THAT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THEY WERE COMMON. GOT INTO SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT. NOW IT'S FIVE SIX HOURS LATER THE FIRES COMING DOWN THE HILL- IT'S JUST TAKEN US OVER SO WE START FROM PATENT WE COULD ADDED THERE- AS WE WATCH MY SON'S HOUSE BURN THE TWO STORY HOUSE BURNED OUR WHOLE HEMP FARM BURNED RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR OWN ICE. IT'S A DEVASTATING EXPERIENCE AND SOMETHING I HOPE NONE OF YOU EXPERIENCE- AND IT'S ALWAYS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT IT HAPPENED TO US. THANK GOD WE WERE ABLE TO HELP SAVE A BUNCH OF ANIMALS ON THE NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY. WE WERE ABLE TO- GET SOME OF OUR PERSONAL ITEMS BUT NOT MANY OUT OF THERE. AS WE SEEN THIS FIRE COMING OVER THE HILLS. IT'S JUST A- WHEN YOU MAKE THAT NINE ONE ONE CALL YOU NEVER WANT TO DO IT BUT WHEN YOU FINALLY NEED IT WASN'T AVAILABLE. HI LOST CLOSE TO A MILLION A HALF TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF STRUCTURES OF HAMP. IT IS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH INDUSTRY TO BE INVOLVEDIN. FROM AS IT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM RIGHT NOW- PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THE BENEFITS OF THIS PRODUCT NOT ONLY ON THE BEAUTIFUL SIDE OF IT BUT ALSO. TO HELP WITH DEFORESTATION AND STUFF I THINK IT'S A GREAT COMMODITY FOR US IN THE FUTURE. WHAT BOTHERS ME HERE. AS SPEAK TO YOU TODAY I PURCHASED THIS FARM. I PAY MY TAXES. WHEN I WANT TO GET INSURANCE I WAS DENIED FROM INSURANCE I HAD FOUR DIFFERENT BROKERS COME TO THE PROPERTY. I ASKED HIM TO ENSURE THE FARMS I GOT DENIED. I ASKED HIM TO INSURE MY STRUCTURE THEY SAID WELL YOUR STRUCTURES ARE TOO OLD I SAID WELL I BOUGHT THE FARM THEY WERE ALREADY PERMITTED STRUCTURES AND WE WENT AHEAD AND DID OPERATIONS IN THE STRUCTURE. WE ARE STILL DENIED FROM INSURANCE THEN WE WENT AFTER THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN AND WE WERE DENIED FROM THAT AS WELL. SO AS I SPEAK FROM NO BOUNDARIES FARM I'M ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF ALL THE OTHER FARMERS RANCHERS OUT THERE. WHAT IT'S LIKE. TO TRY TO GET THE MINDSET TO REBUILD. WHO'S GOING TO HELP US IS THERE MONEY AVAILABLE FOR US WE DON'T KNOW- IT'S BEEN VERY DEVASTATING FOR MYSELF FOR MY FAMILY MOVING FORWARD- AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO ASK FOR HELP. US FARMERS NEED INSURANCE WE CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN WITHOUT INSURANCE WITHOUT YOUR GUYS HELP OUT THERE. RIGHT NOW THE REMAINING PRODUCT THAT I HAD LEFT I HAD TO MOVE DOWN TO COLLECT TO GO TO A FRIEND'S PLACE TO HELP DRY THE REMAINING PRODUCT THAT I WAS ABLE TO SALVAGE. SO I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE FARMERS TO LIST DO SOMETHING. THANK YOU. MISTER COUPLES REALLY APRECIATE- YOU MAKING THE TIME- YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR SHARING YOUR STORY. AND WE'LL RESERVE QUESTIONS AND TELL ALL OF THE PRESENTERS OF SPOKEN. NEXT SPEAKER LIKE TO INVITE- WOULD BE DOCTOR DAVE DALY THE RANCHER- WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLE ASSOCIATION BELIEVE HE HE'S HERE IN PERSON SO- AGAIN MR DAILY YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME UP THESE CABLES YOU CAN STAND AS FAR AS WELL. AS. YEAH. YEAH ASSEMBLY. WHAT AREA WE'RE GOOD THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THIS IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO ALL OF AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL AND- I DON'T WANNA SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON PERSONAL STORIES BUT I CERTAINLY HAVE ONE AND PAST PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA CALLUM'S ASSOCIATION BUT I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME MY ENTIRE LIFE FIFTH GENERATION. IN BUTTE COUNTY SO I HAVE TO WATCH MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND JAMIE JOE HANSON'S ONE OF THEM LEAVE THE CAMPFIRE AND NOW THE NORTH LIGHTNING COMPLEX WHICH STRUCK ME VERY CLOSE TO HOME IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS I PROBABLY HAD TEN TO FIFTEEN FIRES ON MY VARIOUS PROPERTIES ON MY BRANCHES UP BUT IN THAT CASE. NONE HAS BEEN AS DESTRUCTIVE AND EACH TIME IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GETTING TO A GREATER DESTRUCTION AS THESE FIRES ARRIVED AND I'M REALLY NOT HERE WORRY ABOUT WHY IT'S LET'S DO SOMETHING AND IN THIS CASE THEN THE NORTH LIGHTNING COMPLEX WHICH WE CALL THE BARE FIRE THE TIME CAME SO QUICKLY THROUGH OUR MOUNTAIN RANGE. THAT WITHIN ABOUT TWELVE HOURS A DAY OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES AND THAT INCLUDED- THE MAJORITY MY CAL HEARD ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED COWS AND THEIR CALVES WERE KILLED IN THE FIRE- THAT IS NOT ALL- PRIVATE LAND IT'S HALF FEDERAL AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS ISSUE IS CERTAINLY NOT JUST A STATE ISSUE IT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE AS WELL IT'S THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR NATIONAL FORESTS I HAVE PERMITS ON THE PLUMAS NATIONAL FOREST AS WELL AS LEASED LAND WITH SIERRA PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL A GREAT LOGGING TIMBER FIRM THAT I'VE WORKED WITH FOR DECADES. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE ALL THAT LAND WAS GONE IN ABOUT TWELVE HOURS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS A CATTLEMAN TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR SITUATION TENDS TO BE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN AS WE'VE HEARD FROM VINEYARDS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH ARE HIGH DOLLAR- PER ACRE BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS NOT ONLY US THAT SUMMER AND THE LOSS OF TEMPER IT'S THE WILDLIFE IN ITS ENVIRONMENT. THAT PARTICULAR FIRE IS BETWEEN THE SOUTH FORK IN THE MIDDLE FORK OF THE FEATHER. RIVER WHICH IS A DRAINAGE FOR LIKE ORVILLE. HE WHAT'S GOING TO THIS YEAR IT DOES RAIN. LET'S GO TO HAPPEN TO LIKE OR BILL THAT JUST IN. ME PER. BUT IMPACTS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY FRANKLY THE ENTIRE STATE WE SEE THAT- I WE HAD A SMALL RAIN YESTERDAY AND I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT RAIN. WE GET ONE OF THE MAJOR ONES LIKE ORACLE'S GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT PLACE. IN TERMS OF POLLUTION IN THE RUNOFF THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR THERE. SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE OUR CATTLE WERE. KILLED IN SOME PRETTY HORRIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES- IT'S DIFFICULT TO WATCH. AND TO SEE WE HAD TO GAIN ACCESS WHICH WAS DIFFICULT TO DO BUT WHEN WE DID. WE ARE STILL AN ACTIVE FIRE ZONE. AND WHAT WE WOULD FIND WERE CATTLE THAT WERE BURNT TRYING TO GET AWAY- AND SOME OF THE PICTURES- RIFIC YOU MAY HAVE SEEN SOME OF THOSE WERE PUBLISHED. BUT WHEN YOU WALK UP ON A GROUP OF EIGHT CHAO'S WITH THREE BABY CAST BUT WHEN I REPEAT ROUTINE AND BURNT- BEYOND RECOGNITION. MY DAUGHTER IS A VETERINARIAN MY SON'S SOLD MY YOUNG SON SOLDIER THE OLDEST ONE RANCHERS WITH ME ALL THREE WERE HELPING. AND WE'RE HOME AT THE TIME THEY GOT THERE SOON AS THEY COULD. TO HAVE AN ACTIVE FIRE IN THE BOTTOM OF CREEK. AND CAL WITH THEIR LEGS BURNED OFF. I'M SORRY TO BE GRAPHIC IN STILL LIFE. AND MICE EUTHANIZE- AND HE WAS GOING TO LOOK FOR OTHER CATTLE OF THE TIME SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THERE IT'S SO SMOKY. MY DAUGHTER SAW A CATHOLIC INSIDE OF HER. INDEED AN EMERGENCY C. SECTION WAS ONLY FIVE MINUTES TOO LATE. THAT'S A RIFIC. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AGRICULTURE IN SO IT IS AN ECONOMIC LOSS AND I GET THAT BUT THIS IS A LOSS TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO EMPHASIZE. THIS IS NOT A LEFT AND RIGHT ISSUE. AT ALL. THIS IS CALIFORNIA ISSUE AND WE NEED TO WORK ON IT. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK TOO OFTEN WE GET INTO CAMPS. IS THIS CLIMATE CHANGES AS MANAGEMENT I DON'T CARE. DO SOMETHING. RIGHT I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE DIFFERENCES AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN OVER TIME HE MY PARTICULAR INSTANCE. I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE PRESCRIBED BURN CONTROLLED BURNS WE CALL THEM. OR AN ACTIVE TOOL. THEY WERE TOLD THAT WE COULD USE IN THE WINTER TIME. AND THE RIGHT CONDITIONS TO REDUCE FUEL LOADS WE STOPPED DOING THAT. TO ANY DEGREE PROBABLY THIRTY YEARS AGO AND EVERY YEAR IS LASTIN PART THAT IS A REGULATORY ISSUES THAT PREVENT US FROM DOING SO. I WOULD DEARLY LOVE TO SEE- NOT A CHALLENGE BETWEEN. CAL FIRE AND AIR RESOURCES BOARD OF WHEN WE CAN BURN A WIN WE CAN'T BURN. I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY SAY OKAY IT'S THE WINTER TIME MAYBE THERE'S AN AIR QUALITY CHALLENGE BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE ONE WE'RE GOING TO GET IF IT BURNS FOR TWO MONTHS IN THE SUMMER. I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMEONE WHO HAD THE AUTHORITY IN THE STATE AT SOME LEVEL TO SAY. WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS WORK WE'RE GONNA DO MORE CONTROL FINE FUEL REDUCTION FOR FUEL REDUCTION IN THE WINTER TIME. THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO DO BECAUSE CITIZENRY APPROPRIATELY SO ARE PETRIFIED OF FIRE. AND THE FUEL LOADS ARE pARE AFRAID OF LIABILITY IF I DO CONTROL OVER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF IT HAPPENS TO ESCAPE WE REALLY NEED AND I TRUST THE SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA HELP US IN THIS. THE EXPERTS ON THE GROUND TO SAY WE CAN BURN AT THIS TIME WE'VE GOT TO REDUCE FUEL LOADS. SECONDARILY GRAZING CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THAT. SCENARIO INFINE FUEL REDUCTION THERE'S BEEN SOME RECENT RESEARCH FROM DEBURAU WITH UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION WHICH SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF FINE FUELS A RENEWED BIKE RACING. I THINK IT'S KIND OF. ACTUALLY I JUST I DON'T KNOW IF I WERE USE WHERE HUMOR IS MAYBE A LITTLE FRUSTRATING ALL OF A SUDDEN GRAZING REGRET SHEEP AND GOATS IN TOWN IT'S REALLY COOL. AFTER WE ELIMINATED IT FOR THE LAST FIFTY TO SIXTY YEARS. YOU KNOW WHEN WE KNEW IT WAS COOL BEFORE BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S LIKE WELL WE CAN REDUCE FUEL LOADS IF WE RAISE WE KNEW THAT. AND WE MADE IT SO HARD TO DO THAT PEOPLE ARE UNWILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK A LIABILITY ECONOMICS THE CHALLENGES. SO IF I HAD TO REQUEST AND I REALIZE THESE ARE NOT ONES THAT THIS ONE COMMITTEE BY ITSELF WOULD BE ABLE TO DO. BUT ONE IS WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT PERSON AT. THE ABILITY TO USE PRESCRIBED FIRE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US LIABILITY PROTECTION TO DO SO WE NEED TO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CAL FIRE. THAT ALLOW US TO BURN EVEN THOUGH AIR RESOURCES. BOARD SAY HAND MAYBE A LITTLE QUESTIONABLE TODAY. THEN WE MISS OUT OPPORTUNITY. AND THEN WE BURN TOWN. A CAMPFIRE. PARADISE EIGHTY NINETY PEOPLE BURNED. RIGHT BERRY CREEK THE LITTLE TOWN. IN OUR AREA FOURTEEN PEOPLE DIED JUST ABOUT A MONTH AGO. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT AGRICULTURE THIS IS SOMETHING FAR LARGER THAN- I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AGREE ON THAT WE HAVE AN ISSUE IT'S CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S A MANAGE BUT IT'S BOTH LET'S PUT OVER OUR QUIT ARGUING ABOUT WHICH IT IS AND JUST DO SOMETHING THAT'S EFFECTIVE. MY COURAGE OF IT AT WHATEVER LEVEL YOU CAN DO IS TO REALLY TALK TO PEOPLE AND SAY PRESCRIBED FIRE NEEDS TO BE A TOOL LET'S DO IT LET'S USE GRAZING ON STATE FEDERAL AND MUNICIPAL LANDS INSTEAD OF PUTTING BARRIERS IN TO DO THAT I THINK IT GIVES US SOME OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISS DALY WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE- ALL OF YOU YOU'RE A INFORMATION VERY FORMATIVE- AND I'M SURE WEMAY HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- THANK YOU. AT THE CONCLUSION. NEXT PANELIST ALSO HERE IN PERSON IS A CRYSTAL KRAUSE PRESIDENT OF THE SONOMA COUNTY WINE GROWERS. CREWS I APOLOGIZE I WAS JUST CORRECTED IT'S CHRIS- CRUCE. THANK YOU MISTER LIVING. I KNOW. I DON'T REMEMBER FOR LIKE EIGHT YEARS. BROWN I DON'T KNOW IF. YEAH. IT GETS MESSED UP ALL THE TIME SO NO WORRIES HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR RIVAS AND FELLOW AG COMMITTEE MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME OK I'M STILL GETTING USED TO THE MASK SO- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING THIS AFTERNOON- UNFORTUNATELY OUR OUR LOCAL CINEMA COUNTY COMMUNITY AND FARMERS HAVE BEEN- DEVASTATED BY THREE WILDFIRES SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND SO I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE IMPACT TO OUR FARMERS THE IMPACT TO OUR FRMWORKERS AND KIND OF THE WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR US WHERE WE COULD USE SOME HELP AND- I PERSONALLY KNOW THE DEVASTATION CAUSED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I LOST MY HOME IN THE TUBBS FIRE SO. THIS IS NEAR AND DEAR TO ME AS WELL AS HOW DO WE WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE CINEMA COUNTY YET- AND CALIFORNIA A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK AND HAVE MORE- PREDICTABILITY IN OUR FUTURE AS A AS A STATE AND A COMMUNITY CENTER I DO WANT TO START TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FOR REPRESENT AND GIVE SOME CONTEXT ABOUT WHAT FARMING LOOKS LIKE IN CINEMA COUNTY FOR WINEGROWERS WITH ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED GRAPE GROWERS IN CINEMA COUNTY AND ALSO MARIN- OUR LOCAL GRAPE GROWERS FAMILY FARMERS MULTI GENERATIONAL AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY SMALL BUSINESS MEN AND WOMEN SO ABOUT 80% OF OUR LOCAL VINEYARDS ARE LESS THAN A HUNDRED ACRES. 40% LESS THAN TWENTY ACRES SO ONE AT LOSS OF CROP ONE YEAR CAN REALLY PUT SOME OF OUR FARMERS REALLY ON THE FRENCH OF WHETHER THERE CAN CONTINUE TO FARM WHETHER THEY CAN CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR FARMS IN AG LAND WHICH WE KNOW IS SO IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD BUT REALLY FOR THE LANDSCAPE OF CALIFORNIA- THE ECONOMY AND YOU KNOW THE FUTURE FAMILY. FAMILY BUSINESSES SO. EACH OUR FIRE SYSTEM REALLY DE WITH THE REAL DIFFERENT AND- YOU KNOW TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT WAS URBAN FIRE- YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR GROUPS WERE IN MOST OF OUR GROUPS WE- WE HAD ABOUT 95% OF HARVEST DONE- BY THE- OCTOBER DATE WHEN THE TUBBS FIRE IN THE SEVENTEEN FIRES HIT. SO WE DIDN'T SEE THAT IMPACT REALLY TO OUR VINEYARDS INTERCROPPING IN FACT. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HEARD OF THE BENEFIT OF OUR AG LANDS ARE WORKING LANDS SLOWING AND STOPPING FIRES. THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOME GOOD NEWS IN THE SENSE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH AGRICULTURE. UNFORTUNATE THAT TIME WE HAD A FOURTEEN FARMWORKERS LOSE THEIR HOME SO. IN THE OTHER WORK THAT I DO RUNNING THE CINEMA COUNTY GRIPPERS FOUNDATION- WE WORK TO SUPPORT THE SIXTY TWO HUNDRED OF FULL TIME VINEYARD WORKERS. THAT WORK IN CINEMA COUNTY THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED SEASONAL VINEYARD WORKERS. I'M AS WELL AS OTHER FARMWORKERS SO. IN THAT CASE WE YOU- SUPPORTED US FOURTEEN FARMWORKER FAMILIES BY PAYING RENT FOR TWO YEARS. WE BOUGHT THREE R. V.'S FOR TEMPORARY HOUSING. TO TRY TO GET THROUGH THAT SO IT'S AN URBAN FIRE. INTO DOESN'T EIGHTEEN WE HAD THE KINCAID FIRE NOT ONLY DID WE GET IMPACTED BY THE POWER SHUT OFFS. BUT REALLY THE NORTHERN PART OF CINEMA COUNTY WAS LARGELY IMPACTED IN OUR FARMING. AGAIN LATE IN THE YEAR END OF OCTOBER NOVEMBER SELENA HARVEST. SO WE'RE ABOUT 90% OF OUR CROPS IN IT BUT OUR OUR CABERNET SO YOUNG GROWERS. LIKE OUR NEIGHBORS IN NAPA VALLEY FELT A BIG IMPACT TO WHAT THAT HAPPENED. UNFORTUNATELY FOR FARMWORKERS WE ACTUALLY HAD IMPACT OVER A THOUSAND FARMWORKERS AND I SEE IMPACT. WASN'T WE ONLY HAVE FIVE WHOSE HOUSES WHICH I GUESS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FROM SEVENTEEN. BUT WE SAW A LOT OF LOSS OF THEIR INCOME FROM EVACUATIONS FROM LOSS OF WORK BECAUSE OF THE FIRE BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH TIME THEY HAVE TO SPEND AWAY FROM THEIR HOME. BECAUSE OF HOW LONG THE CAN CADE FIRE AND THE SUBSEQUENT EVACUATIONS HOW WIDESPREAD. THEY WERE. I IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THEN TWENTY TWENTY HAPPENED. I THINK WHEN WE THOUGHT WE- HAD SEEN IT ALL WE HAD. JUST BARELY SEE IN THE BEGINNING OF WHAT THE IMPACT COULD BE TO AGRICULTURE. AND OUR FROM OUR COMMUNITY. SO IN TWENTY TWENTY- PART OF THE ISSUE IS NOT THAT IT JUST HAPPENED IN CINEMA COUNTY AND NOT THEN ARE AND THE NORTH BAY. IS THAT WE SAW THIS YOU KNOW. TRUMP TRAGEDY AND- FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE DIFFERENT WINE REGIONS. WHICH REALLY EXASPERATED THE ISSUES FOR A LOCAL GRAPE GROWERS AND OUR VENDOR PARTNERS. SO TWENTY TWENTY- YOU KNOW THE ABOUT THE FIRST START FIRE STARTED IN AUGUST. AND SO WE SAW SO MANY OF OUR CROPS OF IMPACT. BY SMOKE EXPOSURE. AND ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WAS NOT GOING TO GET THE TESTING DONE IN TIME NOT HAVING ENOUGH TESTING RESOURCES. WE JUST AGREE OF COURSE TO- TO- TO INFORM US ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEIR HARVEST REJECT- CROP WOULD BE. WELL GONE HARVESTED WILL BE REJECTED. AND THEY SAID ABOUT ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND TONS OF GRAPES IN SONOMA COUNTY WENT. ON HARVESTED. OUT OF ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TON AVERAGE CROP. THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OUR LOCAL FARMERS AND THAT IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES THAT DIDN'T GET- HARVESTED. THAT'S JUST LOCALLY IN THE AGAIN THESE ARE SMALL. BUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN. ARE ARE BARELY YOU KNOW KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON ON THEIR FARM OR TRYING TO EMPLOYEE. THE FARMERS. WITH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FORMER FOR FAMILIES IMPACTED- AND- AGAIN TO OF OUR LOCAL FARMER FAMILIESLOST THEIR HOMES. AND INTO TWENTY TWENTY FIRES. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS THE TRICKLE DOWN IMPACT SO WE KNOW DURING HARVEST- ARE FARMWORKERS OUR VINEYARD WORKERS ARE MAKING. YOU KNOW THIRTY DOLLARS PLUS AN HOUR BECAUSE WE CHANGED TO A PIECE RATE. SO WE KNOW A LOT OF THEM. LOST THAT WORK FOR THOSE COUPLE OF WEEKS SORTS TYPICALLY WOULD BE THAT THE HIGHLIGHT OF THEIR SEASON IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT. SORT TRYING TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT. AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WE KNOW IT WAS NOT HARVESTED BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRICKLE DOWN IMPACT WILL BE. OF OUR VENDORS NUMBERS WORK TOGETHER TO BRING IN GRAPES. IN MAY NOT OF AND- SUBSEQUENTLY CRUSH RIND IT MAY NEVER OR GET MADE INTO. AND SO AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO- IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO. ONE WHEN WE NEED HELP WITH ALL OF THE INSURANCE ISSUES IN THE LAND MANAGEMENT THAT. MY PREVIOUS PALACES SPOKEN ABOUT SO I WON'T TOUCH ON KNOWS. THE TO SPECIFIC AREAS THAT ARE CONCERNING. IS THE FUTURE OF GETTING US TESTING FASTER MORE AVAILABILITY. SO WE HAD SO MUCH UNPREDICTABILITY AND WHAT WAS HARVESTED- AND WHETHER THOSE GROUPS ACTUALLY BE MADE INTO WINE JUST BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET GOOD TEST RESULTS BACK. IN TIME. SO WE TOOK A LOT OF RISK ACROSS GOT LEFT ON THE VINE BECAUSE WONDERS DID WANT TO TAKE THAT RISK SUCH A FINANCIAL IMPACT TO THE FARMERS. AS WELL AS A FINANCIAL IMPACT TO THE FARMWORKERS. THE OTHER THING THAT'S CONCERNING IS OUR GROWERS AND MOST OF THEIR CONTRACTS. ARE BASED ON WHAT THE AVERAGE ON CROP RATE IS IN THE CAR AND THE ANNUAL CROP REPORT REQUEST REPORT. WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW THAT IS GOING TO BE TO TERM THIS YEAR WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WINERIES ARE GONNA REPORT TO WE KNOW A LOT OF GROUPS DIDN'T GET HARVESTED. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE VALUE WOULD BE OF THOSE GROUPS THAT DID GET HARVESTED BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT WAS A NEGOTIATION. CROP- DEDUCTIONS TAKEN. IT'S WE DON'T KNOW THIS IS A CDFA THING WE'RE REALLY NEED HELP AND I THINK WORKING WITH CALLS AT THE STATE LEVEL THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ONE GROUP GROWERS. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS A GOOD BASELINE. BECAUSE ARE A LOT OF AGAIN ACROSS OUR OUR- OUR CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON WHAT THAT AVERAGE SO THE GIRLS GET PAID ON AN- AVERAGE PINO NORFOLK ON PRICE. PER TON ON AVERAGE CABERNET SAUVIGNON PRICE FOR TIME. AND THE USE THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S BASELINE. THERE'S GONNA BE COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN I'M NOT HEARING OF ANYONE THAT'S FIGURED OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO NAVIGATE THIS YEAR SO THAT IS ONE OF OUR BIG CONCERNS. AGAIN IN ADDITION TO SORT OF LOOKING AHEAD SO. WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION I THINK LIKE EVERYONE ASIDE- WE'RE REALLY THANKFUL TO- HAVE YOU CHAIR RIVAS- GOING AROUND THE STATE AND VISITING AND MEETING WITH OUR OUR LOCAL FARMERS. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT SUPPORT AND WE NEED TO BRING AN END. TO THE WILD FIRES WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER LAND MANAGEMENT AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. NOT ONLY OUR GRAPE GROWERS AND FARMERS BUT OUR FARMWORKERS. WITHOUT ALL. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. MISTER REALLY APPRECIATE- YOU BEING HERE AND- I HAVE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU SO MUCH. OUR NEXT PANELIST TO SPEAK WILL BE JOINING US- OVER THE PHONE IT'S A WHOLE. MUZA RIEGO SAYS ANA STASIO- WITH BRISA DE ANO RANCH A MODERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR A CALL.

ON AUGUST TWENTIETH OF THIS YEAR- WE HAVE- WERE AS GOOD AS A SMALL FARM AND WE APPRECIATE YOU YOU HAVING US HERE I JUST BECAUSE AS- A SMALL FARMERS EXPERIENCE THIS- I THINK EXPERIENCE THAT'S MAYBE- IT IN A BIT OF THE UNIQUE WAY- IN DIFFERENT RESPECTS ARE R. G. AS I MENTIONED BEING A VERY REAL COMMUNITY- IT. DID NOT GET A LOT OF TENSION DURING THE FIRES IN TERMS OF A RESPONSE FROM- IF TRUMP FROM FIREFIGHTING FORCES I DO TOO SO MANY FIRES GOING IN DIFFERENT PARTS- YOUR ONGOING DIFFERENT PARTS THE STATE- WE- ENDED UP- HAVING TO. DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUE OURSELVES- AS WITH THE CASE ARE FORMED IN A LOT OF OUR FARMS OUR COMMUNITY- WE ENDED UP- SIGNIFIERS- IT STARTED UP IN THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE OUR FARM. I ON AUGUST SIXTEENTH- FROM LIGHTNING STRIKES THAT THAT STRUCK THERE AND- THE FIRE KIND OF CREPT DOWN THE MOUNTAINS TOWARDS OUR FARM. OVER THE COURSE NEXT THREE DAYS. DURING THOSE THREE DAYS WE WERE ABLE TO- PREPARE TO A LARGE DEGREE- WE ARE ABLE TO CUT FIRE BREAKS. WE'RE ABLE TO- USER ADDITIONS SYSTEM TO SPRAY DOWN. A- CAL HOSED DOWN ESPECIALLY THE PRIMER OF THOSE HEARTBREAKS- TO ENSURE. THAT THE- ARE WE NOT WE'RE NOT GONNA COME WITHIN THE PER- WE SPEND CENTURY DAYS DO THIS NON- MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE SIGN DURING THAT TIME PERIOD AS WELL. AND WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT THAT FROM THAT WORK AND ALSO WORK OF BEING THERE THE DAY OF THE FIRE TO CONFRONT THE FIRES YOU CAN DAYS AFTER- THAT EVERYTHING WITHIN. THE PERIMETER THAT WE CREATED HELD AND WAS OKAY. YOU GO TO OUR HOMES OUR FIELD ALTHOUGH WE DID LOSE A LOT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TOOLS EQUIPMENT. THAT WERE OUTSIDE THAT PERIMETER- AMOUNTING TO WHAT WOULD BE ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR US- WHICH- FOR A SMALL FARM LIKE OURS A SIZEABLE- WE ENDED UP- WORKING A LOT OF CAL FIRE IN THAT TIME PERIOD- OFFICIALLY- OUR OUR REZONE WAS FORCED TO EVACUATE AS WITH THE CASE FOR MANY AREAS- BUT AS THERE WERE SO MANY FIRES ON GOING AT THE SAME TIME YOUR STATE. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE COMMUNITY RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH KALIFORNIA RESOURCES TO BE DEDICATED TO A REAL COMMUNITY LIKE OURS WE JUST WEREN'T THAT MANY HOUSES FOR PEOPLE IN THE AREA- WITH A LOT MORE ATTENTION ARE BEING FOCUSED. ELSEWHERE- KALIFORNIA- THE FOLKS MAKE UP ARTWORK HERE- FACT BY THE FIRED WITH US WERE INCREDIBLE AND HER- CAN AND YOUR EFFORTS- DAY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAVING A LOT OF THE AREAS IN OUR COMMUNITY- BUT I DO ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO- DISTRESSED. IN TERMS OF OUR EXPERIENCE WAS THAT FOLKS ARE COMMITTEE WERE ALSO. AB CREDIBLY NECESSARY- IN SHAPING AROUND FARMS AND RANCHES- WE DID SO BY SUPPORTING CAL FIRE TO A LARGE DEGREE WE WERE THE ONES OFTEN USING ARE ARE USUALLY JUST ENDS TO FILL UP THEIR WATER TANKS- SO THEY COULDN'T THEY COULDN'T RESPOND WATER MORE RAPIDLY- WE WERE. KIND OF STARTING A SCOUTS FOR CALIFORNIA AND SHOW THEM WHERE THE FIRE WHICH WAS GOING AND- AND WHAT STRUCTURE THEY NEED TO BE AWARE OF- WE ALSO WORK. ACTIVELY USING OUR TRACTORS ARE EQUIPMENT. TO CREATE FIREBREAKS- TO PULL OUT- TREES FROM FROM AREAS AS WELL WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. CONTRACTOR DURING THE DAYS OF THE FIRE IN THE DAYS AFTER- JUST PHYSICALLY. YEAH HE OUTRAGE FROM THE BASE WITH A TRAINED TIED TO OUR TRACTOR- DO YOU. TELL THOSE EFFORTS WE WERE ABLE TO. SAVE OUR FARM AND- AND ALSO A LOT OF OTHER FORMS IN OUR COMMUNITY YOU'RE KIND OF WORLD OF MUTUAL WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY. WITH CAL FIRE. I WOULD THINK THAT WHAT THIS. THIS TO GO TO SAY IN TERMS OF HOW WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. THE FUTURE. IS ENSURING THAT OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS. ARE PART OF THE- SOLUTION IN TERMS OF ACTIVELY BEING ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE FIRES. DURING THE TIME PERIOD WE WERE OFFICIALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON OUR FARM. WHICH WAS OUTSIDE OF THE DECORATIONS ON THIS IS THE CASE FOR. EVERYBODY ELSE IN OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL- OF WHICH PROBABLY MORE THAN HALF. OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY STAYING. BEHIND BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THEY HAD TO BE THE ONES TO FIGHT THE FIRE THEMSELVES. TO A LARGE DEGREE. IT MAKING SITUATION A BIT MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE WHEN WE NEEDED TO GO FOR EXAMPLE PICK UP SUPPLIES- WE COULDN'T GET- WE CAN GET THOSE BECAUSE WE CAN GO THROUGH A BOX. ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS FOR EXAMPLE. OUR NEIGHBORING FARM- HE WAS ACTIVELY FIGHTING THE FIRE- THAT WAS THE SPOT FOR A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS. FROM CATCHING. IT STARTING A FIRE ON HIS BAR- WE ENDED UP- HEATED UP. HAVING A PIPE BURST. AND HE USUALLY WOULD CALL THE LOCAL. THE COMPANY AND HAVE THEM- DELIVER A- THANK YOU. THEY COULD DO THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE. AND SO HE ENDED UP BACK HAVING TO DOWN TO THE BLOCK. AND IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT PERMITTED EVEN HAVE THEM PAST THE HYPE OVER THE ROAD BLOCK. TO AN- ARM IT SHOULD THEY HAVING HAVING A LOT MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION TERMS OF HIS ABILITY TO DEFEND THE HIGHER. I THINK THAT. IN THE FUTURE HAS AS SOME OF THE OTHER. SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED. WE NEED TO BE A BIT MORE- PART OF THE SOLUTION IN TERMS OF RECOGNIZING THAT WE AS FARMERS AND RANCHERS HAVE A LOT OF THE TOOLS EQUIPMENT KNOWLEDGE SKILLS. TO ADDRESS THESE FIRES AS THEIR CURRENT BEFORE THEY'RE OCCURRING- AND ALSO IN THE PROGRAMME PREPARATION PROCESS- IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO- THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE- LIKE YOU KNOW. ESSENTIALLY CREATING CRANK HARBERTS RUN AROUND AROUND AREAS WHICH IS. SOMETHING THAT THAT COLD BE LEGISLATED- AND HAVING THE FUNDS TO DO THAT. IN ADDITION TO THAT BEING ABLE TO- BEING ABLE TO ALSO FOCUS ON COVER CROPPING AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE- LAND THAT RETAIN MORE MOISTURE SO DEALS FOR EXAMPLE COULD BE COVER CROPS WHICH- HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER POSITIVE IMPACTS BEYOND. YOU KNOW FIVE ATTENTION TERMS OF BILLING SOIL CAPTURING CARBON. AND SO ON- IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE EXPERIENCED THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- LEGISLATIVELY- AS- NUMBER FOCUS SPOKEN ON FIRE INSURANCE I DON'T WANT TO BE GOT TO MUCH BECAUSE OUR FOLKS HAVE BUT THAT'S ALSO A VERY CRITICAL THING. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO- ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE LAST YOU KNOW. HOW DOZEN YEARS OR SO OF WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE- AND BEYOND THAT IS- THINKING MORE ABOUT HOW- WE CAN WE CAN USE THIS MOMENT TO. INCLUDE FARMERS RANCHERS IN AND RESTORING A LOT OF LANDS. THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED- THERE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS RUSSIAN ISSUES IN OUR AREA AND THERE HASN'T BEEN. MUCH EFFORT. THUS FAR TO ADDRESS THAT- I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WE CAN USE- FARMERS AND RANCHERS SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE IN TERMS OF. AN EQUIPMENT IN ADDITION THAT TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON RESTORATION. OF A LOT OF LANDS AROUND OUR FARMS- I THINK. THE MORE OF THE STORY IN MY OPINION IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES FARMERS RANCHERS. IN THE FIRE PREPARATION. ACTIVE RESPONSE. AND RESTORATION PROCESS. AND HOPE THAT WE CAN. HAVE IT. IN A CERTAIN DEGREE OF CRAZINESS IN TERMS OF ORGANIZING HOW THE SYSTEMS COULD LOOK. BUT I IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. LIKE OURS IT'S ESSENTIAL BECAUSE- AS AS WE SAW ON THE PARTICULAR. THEY'RE JUST WEST ENOUGH REACHED- DIVIDE THE FACT OF THE AREA IT JUST REALISTICALLY. IT WASN'T A CASE IN AND IT IS NOT TO. BLAME ANYBODY BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED CAL FIRED AN INCREDIBLE JOB FOR THAT THE FOLKS WHO WERE HERE- THE FIREFIGHTERS WERE WERE. ACTUALLY AEROBIC. BUT I DO THINK THOUGH THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN INCLUDE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND FACING THESE FIRES- I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS HAVING ME HERE TODAY. AND I HOPE THAT THAT- WE CAN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD IN TERMS OF CREATING. MORE COLLABORATIVE SOLUTIONS- IN IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING FIRES AND BEING PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND COLD REALLY APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THE TIME- AND PJ YOUR TESTIMONY- VERY INFORMATIVE. OUR FINAL SPEAKER FOR THIS PANEL WILL BE JOINING US FROM THE WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM- ARNOLFO SOLORIO WITH THE NAP UP FARMWORKERS FOUNDATION. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU WE DON'T SEE YOU ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OF THAT THERE YOU ARE FANTASTIC'S ANALOGOUS TO YOU AND HERE YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE WHOLE COMMITTEE. R. MY NAME IS UNOFFICIAL AUDIO- I'M HERE REPRESENTING- NAPA VALLEY FARMWORKER FOUNDATION ABOUT WILDFIRE IMPACT ON UP OF ALL THE FARMWORKERS. THE MISSION OF ENOUGH FOR FARMWORKERS FOUNDATION IS TO SUPPORT AND PROMOTE NAPA VALLEY'S VINEYARD WORKERS THROUGH EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE NAPA VALLEY FARMWORKER FOUNDATION IS THE FIRST OF THE SKYLINE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN NOW OTHER REGIONS HAVE BEGUN MODELLING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AFTER IT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE HAVE A REACH OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND BEING YOUR WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND PROVIDED ALMOST THREE THOUSAND HOURS. OF EDUCATION. WHILE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES LACK PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESOURCES FOR FARMWORKERS. WE HAVE FOCUSED ON CREATING ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING. INCREASING FARMWORKERS TECHNICOLOR SKILL SETS IN OPPORTUNITIES ARE FOR UPWARD MOBILITY. IN A TYPICAL YEAR OUR BROAD RANGE OF FREE CLASSES FOR NAPA COUNTY FARMWORKERS INCLUDES ENGLISH LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT TRAINING. MEDICAL TRAINING MY- NOT BE GETTING THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. A SCHOOL SYSTEM. ELEGY TRAINING AND MORE. EMERGENCY STATE OF THE NAPA COUNTY ONE GRAPE INDUSTRY. TODAY WE ARE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY. SMOKE FROM BOTH THE L. ANNUAL LIGHTING COMPLEX FIRE IN GLASS FIRE HOUSE BECAUSE GROWERS AND WINERIES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DUE TO DAMAGE CROPS AND CANCEL GREAT PURCHASE CONTRACTS. THE CLASSIFIED ALONE HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO RESULT IN UP TO ONE BILLION IN LOSSES TO THE WINE INDUSTRY. FOR THOSE WITH CROP INSURANCE COVERAGE RARELY EQUALS FULL MARKET PRICE. IN THERE CURRENTLY IS NO DISASTER RELIEF AVAILABLE FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM SMOKE DAMAGE. ALL OF THESE HAS A BIG IMPACT ON FARMWORKERS. OUR PREMIUM FREE MILITARY ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT HAVE BEEN YOUR WORKER HAVE LOST AN AVERAGE OF FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EACH WHICH COULD EQUATE TO NEARLY FIFTY MILLION IN LOST WAGES. SOME WINERIES REPORT THAT NOT TWENTY TWENTY VINTAGE WOULD BE PRODUCE. WHICH POINTS TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GRAVES GOING ON HARVEST IN MANY HOURS OF WORK LAST. FARMWORKER FOUNDATION FIRE RESPONSE AND HOW LEGISLATORS CAN SUPPORTER FARMWORKERS NOW. THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA WORKER FOUNDATION IS ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT THE WHOLE PERSON THIS MEANS SUPPORTING FARMWORKERS AND NOT ONLY AS WORKERS BUT AS A COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PLAY A ROLE IN HELPING KEEP FARMWORKERS SAFE THE RECENT DISASTERS. BY PROVIDING SAFETY IN WILDFIRE RISK OF THE PATIENT AND DISTRIBUTING ESSENTIAL B. B. E. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. INCLUDING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND NINETY FIVE MOSQUES LEVINE YOUR CRUISE. HOWEVER IT IS MORE THAT CAN BE DONE TO SUPPORT FOR WORKING FAMILIES. WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATOR CAN HELP WITH THIS. SOME EXAMPLES HERE BUT NOT FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL SAFETY NET SUPPORT. CURRENTLY THE FARMWORKER FOUNDATION IS WORKING THROUGH THE NAPA VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION WILD WILDFIRE RELIEF PROGRAM DO SO FOR FARMWORKERS WHO LEAVE IN NAPA COUNTY WITH AN EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR RENT. WORKERS LEAVE IT IN NAPA COUNTY ABLE TO APPLY FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW SO EIGHT THIS IS A HUGE HELP. BUT WE KNOW THAT IT IS STILL FALLS SHORT OF WHAT IS NEEDED. WILSON ALL THEY ARE FARMWORKERS WORKING UP A COUNTY. FOR SOCIAL ECONOMIC REASONS DON'T LEAVE THEIR AND THEY ALSO NEED OUR SUPPORT. WE ASK LEGISLATORS TO CONSIDER WAYS TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING. EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR WORKING FAMILIES FOR HOUSING RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR GROCERIES FOR CHILDCARE WHILE FARMWORKERS CONTINUE TO BE ESSENTIAL WORKERS DURING COMIC NINETEEN. THE FUNDING AND RESOURCES TO OUR FIRE SAFETY PREPAREDNESS AND EDUCATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO NEED ACCESS TO PROPER PP EVACUATION CENTERS AND TEMPORARY HOUSING. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL THE BY THE BY THAT EXCLUDES FARMWORKERS FROM TIMELY AND IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY COMMUNICATION. IT TO DISTRIBUTE MORE INFORMATION FROM TRUSTWORTHY SOURCES AND THE SPANISH. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS AND HOW TO PROTECT THEIR THEIR HEALTH DURING WILDFIRE. WE BELIEVE IN REPETITIVE AND CONSISTENT OUTREACH AND HAVE PROVIDED MATERIALS WEBINARS AND TRAINING. MORE FUNDING AND RESOURCES ARE NEEDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING. MR SOLORIO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THIS AFTERNOON I KNOW THAT WE HAD A LOT OF SPEAKERS ON A PANEL DO WE HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR- ANY PERSON WHO OP. PROVIDED SOME TESTIMONY. MATHIS. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHICH ONE OF OUR PANELISTS COULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE LACK OF INSURANCE PROTECTION THE BEST BUT I BY- MAYBE FARM BUREAU OR ANYBODY ELSE THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. DIGGING A LITTLE DEEPER. INTO THE IMPACTS OF HAVING THOSE INSURANCES CUT FROM OUR AG. SECTOR IF INVADE LIKE TO ELABORATE ON THAT I THINK- HEARING MORE WOULD BE GOOD. DONALD TRUMP WANTS. THE FIRST QUESTION- YOU KNOW  MEAN IT REALLY IS IT'S IN TERMS OF GETTING CAPITAL BEING ABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL EITHER DAY TO GROW YOUR FARM OR O GET TO THE NEXT HARVEST SEASON IN TERMS OF GETTING LOANS- YOU KNOW SO IT IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM IS GONNA BE EXASPERATED EVEN MORE I KNOW I BLAST NUMBERS I SAW. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS I BELIEVE FOLLOWING LAST WILDFIRE SEASON TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THEY'RE ESTIMATING ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST FARMS AND RANCHES- WOULD BE- WOULD NOT BE RENEWED IT WOULD HAVE TO TURN TO THE FAIR PLAN- IT'S SO YOU HAVE TO THINK AFTER BURNING FOUR MILLION ACRES. WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE I'VE ASKED IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED THE INSURANCE. INDUSTRY IF THERE IS OVERALL NUMBERS. BIGGEST CONCERNS WE HAVE IN OUR INSURANCE AGENTS THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE PULLING COMPLETELY OUT OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH ONLY LEAVES A FEW VENDORS LEFT WHO WOULD EVEN BE WILLING MAYBE TO TAKE A RISK THERE BUT THAT'S NEVER GOOD FOR CONSUMERS- WHAT THAT. LITTLE COMPETITION- ED BUT THE BIGGEST IMPACT WE HAVE INSURANCE NOW IS HAPPENING IS THAT THESE FIRES THIS YEAR WE'RE STILL CATASTROPHIC AND BURNED SO. HOT AND FAST. IT BURNED. FARMLAND THAT NORMALLY YOU WOULDN'T SEE IN A WILD FIRE ZONE EVEN IN THE EVEN A STANISLAUS AND SAN JOAQUIN COUNTIES WE WERE SEEING FIRES AND EVACUATIONS- HAPPENING. OR UNHEARD OF AND SO YOU SAW. YOU KNOW THE- THE DIFFERENT COMMODITIES THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THIS AND OF COURSE. YOU KNOW- WHAT WAS REALLY SHOCKING TO US AS WE GOT THE FIRST LETTERS- A FROM OUR MEMBERS. FROM THE FAIR PLAN- DENYING THEM. AN INSURANCE POLICY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T- INSURE FARMS AND RANCHES. I THINK THAT WAS THE MOST SHOCKING DISCOVERY AND THE MOST DISTURBING- THAT LEAVES US HANGING. BUT CERTAINLY SOME THAT WE NEED TO DIVE IN. INTO DEEPER AND HOW WE GET AROUND THAT WE NEED TO DO IT FAST SO THEY THEY WERE DENIED THE FAIR PLAN. YEAH DATE OF THE FAIR PLAN DOES NOT INSURE FARMS AND RANCHES- THEY THEY WON'T INSURE- LIKE BARNES AND ALL OF THAT. ALL RIGHT THAT'S CLEARLY SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND THEN ALSO- WHAT WELL I HAVE YOU THERE- I KNOW THE- THERE'S A COMMENTS- BY DOCTORED DALY YEAH- BUT- THE WIRE HERE IN AND IF YOU STILL HERE IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS IT AS WELL BUT ABOUT CERTIFICATION- FORGETTING IN TO REMOVE LIVESTOCK- FROM AG LANDS I KNOW- FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT DEAL. DO WITH THAT GREATLY-% MISTER LACEY- THAT THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA CALLUM IN MY DISTRICT- AND SEVERAL OTHERS BUT- I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS A STRUGGLE TO GET UP TO GET PAST- WHERE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE BLOCKED THE ROADS- BUT BUT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON- SERCHHIP. CERTIFIATION PROCESS AND I KNOW THERE'S AN EXISTING ONE BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF HURDLES- I'D I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM ANYONE ON THE PANEL THAT% LIKE TO SPEAK TO WHAT THAT'LL LOOK LIKE. YEAH- IF IT'S SOMETHING- YOU'LL THINK ADMINISTRATIVELY WE CAN ADJUST FIRE HONOR IF IT'S- A LEGISLATIVE THING- WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS FAR AS MAYBE A POSSIBLE. FUTURE COMMITTEE BILL FROM US- LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS YEAH. YEAH AND WE WANT TO BE SAYS EVERYTHING THERE'S A LOT OF POSSIBILITY OF THEIR THE HURDLES THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXISTING FOR- VENDORS WHO CONTRIBUTE TO FIGHTING- FIRES. IT'S REALLY- IT'S A CLASS THAT THEY TAKE A ONE DAY EIGHT HOUR CLASS TO BE CERTIFIED SAY THE DRIVE A WATER TRUCK OR TO OPERATE A CHAINSAW. WE THINK THERE COULD BE ROOM IN THERE AND WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE FACT AND AS ONE OF THE PANELISTS STATED I MYSELF IN THIS LAST EVACUATION DIDN'T LEAVE MY FAMILY DID- I STAYED ON THE FARM TO KEEP THE GENERATOR'S GOING TO KEEP THE ANIMALS FED KNOWING ONCE YOU LEAVE YOU CAN'T GET BACK IN. BUT WE KNOW OUR COMMUNITY WE KNOW OUR SHERIFF'S YOU KNOW THE DEPUTIES WE KNOW OUR- KALIFORNIA MEMBERS THERE SO THEY KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT BUT WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE RUSHING IN THE TIME WHICH PUTS OUR FIRST RESPONDERS IN A IN A BAD SITUATION SPENDING MORE TIME. CALLING US SO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE I KNOW DOCTOR DALY. AND CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA FARM YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF SKETCH AND YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER PANELIST I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GONNA TALK-ON IT BUT SOMEONE TO PURSUE AS WELL MISTER- DAN MAKING IS COMING UP I KNOW HE HAS HAD SOME- SOME CONVERSATIONS- WITH ALL OF US ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE SO WE'RE IN THE PLANNING PROCESS BUT WE DO WANT WE DO UNDERSTAND THE SENSITIVITY. AND DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE WHAT THE FIRST ROLL OF KALIFORNIA IS AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY TIMES. WE APPRECIATE THE BRING- FIRST RESPONDERS FROM OUTSIDE THE AREA WHO MAYBE. DON'T KNOW US AS WELL AS WE KNOW THE LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS SO. COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT CERTAINLY DOCTOR DAILY RECORD IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE OR- THE CERTAINLY- DISTRACT YOU KNOW AT. THAT THAT THE CHAIRS LEISURE OF COURSE BUT I'D I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE. VERY QUICKLY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE ACCESS IS CRITICAL. I DO EMPHASIZE- WHAT. MR HANSEN SAID THOUGH IN THAT IS THAT. WE AREN'T SUGGESTING ANYONE WHO HAS TO GO TO THE DOG GETS IN ANYTIME THEY WANT I THINK THAT PUTS PEOPLE IN AN AWKWARD SITUATION. WE DON'T WANNA DO THAT THE FIRST RESPONDERS. BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN AND I KNOW THE FARMER WAS DONE SO AS WELL. TO LOOK AT SOME SOLUTIONS WHERE WE CAN GET PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. FOR CERTIFIED PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE ACCESS AT APPROPRIATE TIMES. I AND I THINK WE'RE GETTING CLOSE IN OUR PARTICULAR COUNTY WE MET WITH OUR AG COMMISSIONER'S SEAT THERE'S A- ROAD MAP THERE. THAT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL IF WE CAN GET THAT CERTIFICATION BUT AGAIN WITHOUT. COOPERATION FROM ALL AGENCIES. CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS C. H. P. AS WELL AS THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. IT MIGHT FALL ON MOODY YEARS I'VE BEEN TURNED BACK BEFORE. AT AT ROAD BLOCKS. AND HAD TO GO CROSS COUNTRY WHICH IS ACTUALLY MORE DANGEROUS JUST TO BE ABLE TO GET WATER AND FEED THE LIVESTOCK SO. IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE PURSUING IT THANK YOU. IF I MAY SPEAK ON ON ON THE SAME QUESTION FOR JUST A MOMENT AS WELL CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME OKAY. SURE IF YOU CAN- BRIEFLY MAKE OR KEEP. YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF WOULD BE GREAT. OF COURSE YES- BUSINESSES CALL MY SERVICE I THOUGHT YOU- I JUST WANT TO SPEAK HONEST RETAILERS REGARDING LIVESTOCK IN PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE UP SMALLER FARMS. THIS BECAME A BIG ISSUE FOR ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS- WHO WHO IS A VERY SMALL FARM BUT HAS A WIDE A WIDE NUMBER OF- A RABBIT. DUCKS AND CHICKENS- IF FOR HIM AS A SMALL PERSON DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE EQUIPMENT TO MOVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF LIVESTOCK AT ONCE. BEING ABLE TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE FIRESTONE- BUT TRANSFER ALL THE LIVESTOCK OUT IS NOT NECESSARILY REALISTIC. HE HAS FONG WAS NOT REALLY WITH IN HARM'S WAY OF THE FIRE DIRECTLY IT WAS AWAY FROM IT- AND HE FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO STAY THERE TO KEEP ANIMALS ALIVE OTHERWISE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. JUST DIED BECAUSE THE REGULATIONS ON WAS IN PLACE FOR OVER TEN DAYS- I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE A BIT MORE CREATIVE IN TERMS OF PINPOINTING WHAT AREAS ARE ALSO TRULY IN DANGER VERSES WHICH ARE ARE ARE NOT ANARCHIST KIND OF WITHIN THE GREATER. DON'T MATCH THAT'S EASY TO MAINTAIN DUE TO ROADBLOCKS- BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU YOU NEED TO CREATE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF MISTRUST AMONG- FOLKS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR HAVE FARMERS IT IS SMALL FARMERS WHO WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO. GET THEIR ANIMALS IN AND OUT AND JUST ARE GOING TO STAY PERIOD. BECAUSE THEY THEY KNOW OTHERWISE THEIR ARMS WILL DIE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FANTASTIC THANKS I JUST WANTED TO ADD WE'VE HAD- THE A PROCESS INVOLVING IN CINEMA COUNTY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FARM BUREAU ARE AG COMMISSIONER THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND CAL FIRE VOLUNTEERS- SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND HOW WE FOUND IT MOST SUCCESSFULLY WORKING- AND THIS PAST AUGUST WE ACTUALLY DID FIRE SAFETY TRAINING A CAL FIRE VOLUNTEER AND OUR DEPUTY SHERIFF CAME IN WE HAD FARMERS- RANCHERS WINEGROWERS TWENTY FIVE FIFTY AT A TIME GOING THROUGH A FIVE HOUR CERTIFICATION CLASS. IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING HOW FIRE MOVES IN AND OUT THINGS TO BE CAREFUL FOR LOOK FOR SO WE COULD DID A CERTIFICATION THAT WAY AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROCESS WITH THE AYE COMMISSION THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE WHERE THE AG COMMISSIONER- VALIDATES A LEGITIMATE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS AND WHAT WOULD BE DEEMED EMERGENCY FARM ACTIVITIES LIKE TAKING FEEDING CATTLE MILKING COWS HARVESTING ETCETERA AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT VALIDATION TO THE FARMERS OFTHAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A COMMERCIAL OPERATION IN A VIRGINIA MEMBERS OF THE ACTIVITY. THEY THEN TAKE THAT PASSED- CERTIFICATE OF VALIDATION AND AT THE POINT OF ENTRY IS WHEN THE SHERIFF DETERMINES WHAT IF AND WHEN IT'S SAFE TO GO TO THAT SPECIFIC ADDRESS THAT'S ON THAT PASSED SO THAT WAY WE SORT OF WE'VE DONE THE TRAINING IN ADVANCE WE'VE DONE THE VALIDATION THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW DAHLE GONNA GO IT'S AN ACTUAL COMMERCIAL THERE'S AN EMERGENCY FARM ACTIVIA HAS TO HAPPEN AND THEN WE MAKE THE FINAL SAFETY CALL AT THAT POINT IN TIME OF ENTRY AND SO. WE'VE SEEN THAT BE FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL I'M WORKING THROUGH AND WE ACTUALLY ARE STARTING TO WORK WITH OTHER REGIONS AND- OTHER AYE COMMISSIONERS BARBARO'S AND- OTHER WINEGROWING ASSOCIATIONS TO SEE HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT BETTER. AND EVEN OFFER MORE BROADLY THAT PROGRAM. THANK YOU MISS CRUZ- I THINK. IN IN BACK TO MY OWN DISTRICT WE SAW THIS- ED SEVERAL DIFFERENT PHONE CALLS OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE AFRAID TO COME DOWN OFF THE MOUNTAIN- THEY'RE LIKE YEAH I KNOW I KNOW I CAN GO TO. THE THE FAIRGROUNDS TWO TWO THE CENTER AND IN APPLYING GET A PERMIT AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THEN IF I CAN'T GET IT TODAY OR OR THE LINES BACKED UP FOR WHATEVER THEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE REALLY GONNA FAMILY MEMBER SOMEBODY ELSE UP ON THE MOUNTAIN CELLS WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION. ECCENTRICITY THINK HAVING SOME KIND OF A PERMIT SYSTEM THE CERTIFICATE- I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YOU KNOW IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR ACT COMMISSIONERS AND OUR SHARES AND OUR FIRE TO MAKE SURE THE EDUCATIONS OF THEIR- OBVIOUSLY THEY DO HAVE TO TRACK- WHERE THEY'RE GOING AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT ON A I THINK HAVING SOMETHING THAT. EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS HEY THIS IS WHAT IT IS- MAKES SENSE ESPECIALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ALWAYS SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN AND ONE LOCAL JURISDICTION AND THEN ANOTHER AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON- WE'VE SEEN THIS BE A CLEAR PROBLEM. SO I'D LOVE TO. SEE SOME KIND OF A WHITE PAPER FROM FROM THE AG- FOLKS OUT THERE ON WHAT THIS OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH- CALIFORNIE IN THE AG COMMISSIONERS TO ON SOMETHING WE ALL COULD AGREE ON. MAYBE YOU MISTER CHAIR WE COULD RUN THAT AS A- COMMITTEE. BILL OR SOMETHING TO JUST GET SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT WAY EVERYBODY KNOWS. HEY HERE'S THE PROCESS I'M GONNA GO DOWN AND- THIS IS THE CLASS AND THESE ARE TIMES WHEN TO TAKE IT AND- NOW I KNOW SO NEXT SEASON WE'RE- ALL SET AND READY TO GO AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- MR LEVINE. IT IS. LIKE IT'S A FAIR. HE THANK YOU MR HANSEN RAISED THE ISSUE ABOUT AND NINETY FIVE MASKS AND YOU KNOW AT THE BEGINNING F THE YEAR IF I WAS TOLD I WAS GONNA BE PUTTING ON A FACE MASK AS MUCH AS I'D BE PUTTING ON SOCKS I'D BE IN DISBELIEF- THE N. NINETY FIVE MASKS ARE TECHNICALLY SPECIFIC AND THERE IS A FEAR. THAT YOU KNOW THEY JUST WON'T BE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND AND I DON'T THINK WE WERE BEING PUSHED TO WEAR FACE MASKS IN THE BEGINNING- SO MUCH AS TO PRESERVE WHAT PP WAS THERE FOR FIRST RESPONDERS FOR HOSPITALS AND- AND SO THERE WAS A CONCERN. THAT THE FIRST-AVAILABILITY ACCESSIBILITY TO BUY THAT AT THE SCALE THAT AGRICULTURE NEEDED THAT IT JUST WASN'T GOING TO BE POSSIBLE- AND YET THERE WAS- THERE IS CONCERN THAT. YOU KNOW IF WE WEREN'T GOING TO BE GETTING THE N. NINETY FIVE MASKS THAT WE NEED FOR AGRICULTURE THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE- REALLY DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORKING IN AGRICULTURE- HOW REAL- WHERE THOSE CONCERNS AND HOW WE SEEN THEM COME EVEN OUT AS SUPPLY- YOU KNOW BECAME HEALTHIER- AND THE- YOU KNOW LOGISTICS OF GETTING WHAT WE NEEDED- BECAME MORE CLEAR- JUST LIKE. YOU KNOW TWELVE PAPERS BACK ON SHELVES- THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. AND OF PANDEMIC IN THIS LET'S DANCE TO BECAUSE WE KNEW WE COME INTO WILDFIRE SEASON ENDED WITH THE NEW SMOKE THAT REGULATIONS ARE COMES TO OUR OUR WORK FORCE ARE PLEASE. THE NEED FOR THOSE MASS. BUT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC E ARE ASKED TO GIVE UP OUR STOCKPILE THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND IF YOU REMEMBER EVEN THE CDC WAS SAYING IF YOU ARE NOT A FIRST RESPONDER. AND DON'T WEAR A MASK THAT WAS LATER CHANGED- SO WE GAVE OUR SUPPLY THAT WE HAD AN AGRICULTURE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION MASS TO THE FIRST RESPONDERS BUT KEPT REMINDING EVERYBODY. THAT IS ONLY A NINETY FIVE MASS THAT IS WHAT YOU KNOW THAT CAL OSHA CERTIFIES- TO- TO GET OUR WORK FORCE. IN CASE OF- THAT SMOKE WORK DAYS- BUT THERE'S ALSO THE CAYENNE NINETY FIVE OUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO GET THAT CERTIFIED AS WELL COULD THAT MEET THE CERTIFICATION SO. NOR THAT PROCESS IS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO USE THE K. AND NINETY FIVE BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY AN ALTERNATIVE THAT COULD BE OUT THERE IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION LIKE THIS AND THE OTHER. PART THAT REALLY WAS HOW EARLY YOU KNOW THE FIRE I HAVE BACKED AWAY FROM ON SEPTEMBER NINTH I BELIEVE. THAT EIGHT ACTUALLY STARTED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH OR AUGUST SIXTEENTH IN PLUMAS COUNTY. AND HOW LONG THOSE DAYS WERE AND HOW EARLY IT STARTED- REALLY PUT US A BEHIND IN TERMS OF HAVING THAT THE THOSE FACE MASK FOR A WORKERS. COMP BUT WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE RIGHT WHERE WE WERE IN MARCH IN TERMS OF AVAILABILITY. AND THE SHORTAGES WITH THE MASS. ALL RIGHT AND YOU YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ASKING THE QUESTION EARLIER ON ABOUT OR RAISING THE ISSUE ABOUT TREES THAT WERE BEING CUT DOWN. YES YEAH IT SO YOU WOULDN'T WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE- THE FIRE HAZARD MITIGATION THAT UTILITIES ARE DOING THE TREES ARE YOU'RE TALKING TO OR ACTUALLY IN ORCHARD IS OUR NETWORK THAT ARE ACTIVELY FARMED THEY HAVE EASEMENTS OF THE POWER LINES TO THE ORCHARDS STARPOINT REALLY IS THAT THAT IS NOT WHERE THE FOCUS SHOULD BE NOT SHOULD NOT BE IN THE ORCHARDS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS THE TIMELINESS OF HAVING TO CUT THESE TREES AND MITIGATE OR THE FIRE RISK- THAT THE UTILITIES SHOULD REALLY SPEND THE TIME. IN THOSE HIGH SEVERE WILDFIRE AREAS AND NOT IN OUR ORCHARDS AND LITERALLY FARMERS WAKE UP WITH EQUIPMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ORCHARDS AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE THERE- WITH THEIR TREES GETTING STOPPED AND WOOD. DO YOU HAVE. WITH THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE RAISING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS APPROPRIATE. HAVE YOU MAPPED OR OR CONSIDERED WE'RE THE HIGHER RISK LINES ARE SO FOR EXAMPLE P. GENIES OWN INSPECTIONS- ON. THE THE LINE YOU KNOW THAT STARTED- THAT THEY CAN'T FIRE FOR EXAMPLE I WAS VERY WELL KNOWN- THAT THEY NEED TO DO THAT WORK IN IT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT WORK. SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING IN AND BIãU I THINK YOU'D MENTIONED YOU SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU LOOKING OUTLINES THAT HAVE PASSED TESTS AND HAVE. GONE THROUGH MORE RIGOROUS INSPECTIONS AND HAVE HAD BEEN UPDATED MORE RECENTLY THAN THE HUNDRED YEAR OLD LINES THAT PG&amp;E DID NOT DO THE WORK ON OR ARE YOU JUST SAYING WE JUST DON'T WANT THIS BEING DONE NEAR- THE FARMED ORCHARDS. WELL CERTAINLY YOU KNOW FOR POWER TRANSMISSION ITSELF IT IT YOU DON'T WE KNOW OUR WHICH HAS TO BE LOOKED AT BUT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE WHERE WE'RE AT NOT JUST MEETING A GOAL OF REMOVING SO MUCH- SO MUCH FUEL TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS- YOU KNOW FROM CAL FIRE STATE BILL. BUT THAT IS THAT IT SHOULD ONLY BE THE PARTY SHOULD BE WHERE THOSE ACTUAL FIRE RISKS ARE AND I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE MAPS YOU KNOW YOU THAT IF THE TERMS WHAT PG&amp;E IS LOOKING AT WHETHER. HIGH RISK ARE I WILL TELL YOU THE MAPS ARE OUT THERE WHERE THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE START OF THIS YEAR WAS THAT IF IDENTIFIED EXTREMELY HIGH RISK FOR WILDFIRES IS TEN MILLION ACRES. SO WE CAN SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE BURKE FOUR MILLION ACRES BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SIX MILLION STILL OUT THERE THEY'RE CONSIDERED EXTREME HIGH RISK BUT WHAT WE SAW BURNING IN THIS FIRE. WASN'T JUST THE EXTREME HIGH RISK. SO BAG THAT. OUR OUR POSITION IS LIKE LET'S PRIORITIZE WHAT LIMITED FUNDS WE DO GET EVERY YEAR OR WHAT TIME WINDOW WE HAVE. LET'S PRIORITIZE AND MAKE SURE TRULY IS IN A HIGH RISK FIRE AREA WHERE WE ARE. DEALING WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. I THINK MISTER. THANK YOU. HI APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AN INTEREST TIME SINCE WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME SEVEN OF THE PANEL WILL HAVE TO MOVE ON. I APPRECIATE- THE PANELISTS. THAT PARTICIPATED IN THAT PREVIOUS PANEL- THIS THIRD PANEL AGRICULTURE BASED WILDFIRE MITIGATION- THAT'S THE FOCUS. LIKE TO INVITE OUR OUR NEXT PANELIST FOR- THIS ISSUE WHICH IS- DAN MOREN. COUNTY DIRECTOR UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF PLASTER NEVADA- HE I BELIEVE IS HERE. AN REALLY APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US. MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE AND FOR TAKING ON THIS REALLY CRITICAL TOPIC. MY NAME IS DAN MAKIN I AM THE LIVESTOCK AND NATURAL RESOURCES ADVISER WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND I'VE BEEN CALLED MUCH WORSE OR IT'S OKAY. NO WORRIES NO WORRIES. I AM ALSO THE COUNTY DIRECTOR FOR PLASTER IN NEVADA COUNTY AND- LIKE A LOT OF BALL GUYS I WEAR MANY DIFFERENT HATS AND I'M ALSO A SMALL SCALE SHEEP PRODUCER IN PLASTER COUNTY JUST UP THE HILL HERE- I SHOULD START BY SAYING THAT MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE BASED ON MY RESEARCH AND MY- EXPERIENCE AND DON'T NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE VIEWPOINT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- BUT THAT BEING SAID. YOU SEE AG AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND COOPER EXTENSION. HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS RESOURCE THROUGHOUT. THIS CRISIS ON THE GROUND AND IN AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES- I THINK. IT AND REFLECTING ON WHAT PREVIOUS PANELISTS HAVE SAID THAT THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AGRICULTURE IS A PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE- NOT ONLY ADDRESSING BEFORE THE FIRE HAPPENS AND BEING ABLE TO HELP ADDRESS RESPONSE TO WILDFIRE BUT BUT THEN IN THE RECOVERY PROCESS AS WELL. AND I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON JUST ONE AREA WHERE I THINK THERE'S SOME REAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGRICULTURE TO- TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS EFFORT. TARGETED GRAZING- IS THE APPLICATION OF A SPECIFIC KIND AND CLASS OF LIVESTOCK AND A DETERMINE SEASON. FOR DETERMINE MOUNT OF TIME. ADDED A SPECIFIC INTENSITY. TO ACCOMPLISH VEGETATION OR LANDSCAPE LEVEL GOALS. IT REFOCUSES WHAT WE DO IS GRAZING FROM THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD AND FIBER. TO DEALING WITH VEGETATION ISSUES AND I THINK THAT'S A REALY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IT'LL COME BACK TO IN A MOMENT. TARGETED GRAZING CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS AND IN SITUATIONS- AS DR DALY SUGGESTED- GRAZING IN WHILE AND PRESCRIBED FIRE REALLY THE ONLY TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX THAT REMOVE FUEL. ON THE OTHER TOOL STILL THE FUEL ON THE LANDSCAPE AND GRAZING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE ARE UNIQUE IN THAT IN THAT WAY. TYPICALLY TARGETED GRAZING CAN BE VERY COST EFFECTIVE WHERE OTHER OPTIONS ARE INEFFECTIVE OR TOO COSTLY. ON TRAINER TO PARKER FEET IT'S TOO STEEP A REMOTE OR ROCKY TO TREAT WITH WITH EQUIPMENT OR WITH OTHER TECHNIQUES- WE'RE FINDING IT. ON AND IN A VARIETY OF PLACES WHERE IT'S HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN THAT WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE WHERE MAYBE WE CAN'T DO PRESCRIBED FIRE BECAUSE OF THE LIABILITY ISSUES WE CAN CERTAINLY BRING. LIVESTOCK IN AN ENTRY DOES FUEL LOADS AS WELL. WE'RE ALSO FINDING THAT IT'S EXTREMELY VALUABLE IN MAINTAINING WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TO CREATE FUEL BREAKS- MORE WE'VE GONE IN AND DONE THE INITIAL WORK PERHAPS MECHANICALLY. BUT THEN WE CAN USE LIVESTOCK TO MAINTAIN NOT WORKING AND MAINTAIN THE FIRE SAFETY OF THOSE LANDSCAPES. I THINK THE KEY DISTINCTION HERE IS THAT IT'S A SERVICE RATHER THAN A PRODUCTION MODEL. AND AS A SERVICE TAKES- HIGHLY COMPETENT BUSINESS OWNERS AND HIGHLY SKILLED LABOR TO ACCOMPLISH WELL AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY KEY POINTS. TARGETED GRAZING IS DIFFERENT THAN A CONVENTIONAL CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION MODEL. IN THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE VEGETATION. MY SHE BUSINESS I'M FOCUSING ON MAKING SURE MY SHEEP HAVE PROPER NUTRITION ALL YEAR ROUND SO I GET AS MANY LAMBS ON THE GROUND AS I CAN WITH THE TARGETED GRAZING BUSINESS WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON MANAGING THAT BETTER TATIAN AND SO TYPICALLY WE HAVE LOWER REPRODUCTION RATES WE DON'T HAVE THE PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE TO SELL IN A CONVENTIONAL MODEL. AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOW HOWTHIS- PARTICULAR AFRICAN WORK. GRAZING IS YOU CURRENTLY BEING USED- AND DR DALY MENTIONED US AS WELL YOU KNOW IT'S AN ACTIVITY THAT'S BEEN HISTORIC THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. BUT WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN TARGETED GRAZING AS A PARTICULAR APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE. IN THE LAST. FIVE YEARS. WE'VE DOCUMENTED AT LEAST THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WERE GRAZING IS BEING USED AS A FUEL FOR REDUCTION TECHNIQUE- COUNTIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO- MARIN COUNTY- NO SANDRA ELLER IS USING GOATS I KNOW- WE'RE SEEING IT BEING USED IN LOS ANGELES AND TORRANCE AND DIEGO COUNTIES. AND SO THERE'S THIS REAL OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT IN AREAS WHERE PERHAPS THERE HAVE NOT BEEN- LIVESTOCK. PRODUCTION FOR SOME TIME IN A ROLE TARGETED MANNER. WE'RE ALSO HEARING FROM FIRE AGENCIES THAT IT WORKS- YOU KNOW CAL FIRE- THROUGH THE BOARD OF FORESTRY OVERSEAS CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED A- PRESCRIBED YOUR BILL EVERY WHITE PAPER THAT REALLY LAYS OUT HOW THIS CAN WORK IN TERMS OF FUEL REDUCTION. BUT MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY IS THE EVIDENCE ON THE GROUND HERE IN THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- THE HOPLAND RESEARCH EXTENSION CENTER. WHICH UNIVERSITY HOUSE UP NEAR YOU PRIOR. BECAUSE OF A REALLY GRAPHIC EXAMPLE OF THE CHANGE IN FIRE INTENSITY BASED ON GRAZING VERSES ON NORTH NON. NONPARTISAN LANDSCAPES- I'VE TALKED WITH- THE PRODUCER THAT WORKED IN MARIN COUNTY THIS LAST YEAR THAT HEARD FROM. FOLKS- WE'RE A FIRE STARTED AND DIDN'T SPREAD INTO THE WILD LAND BECAUSE OF THE GRAZING THAT IT HAPPENED THERE. SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE PROOF THAT THIS CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL- I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS REALLY FROM LOOKING AT IT FROM KIND OF A- A RESEARCH FROM AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STANDPOINT. WHERE THERE MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE TO ENCOURAGE MORE OF THIS KIND OF WORK. CERTAINLY WE NEED MORE PEOPLE DOING IT- AND SO THE KIND OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION NECESSARY TO GET PEOPLE UP TO SPEED ON THIS- COOPERATIVE EXTENSION IS A GREAT RESOURCE FOR SOME OF THAT TRAINING BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. IN EQUIPMENT AND LIVESTOCK IN AND KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FUEL REDUCTION COST SHARE PROGRAMS ARE CHIEF SCHUMER TALKED ABOUT SENATE BILL NINE OH ONE WHICH PROVIDES SOME MONEY- FOR FUELS REDUCTION OVER THE NEXT. MAKERS FOR YEARS LEFT IN THAT PROGRAM NOW IF I RECALL CORRECTLY- THAT PROGRAM COULD COULD REALLY FOCUS SOME EFFORT ON CARSHARE FOR DOING THIS KIND OF WORK- IT HAS FOCUSED ON A NUMBER OF OTHER FUELS REDUCTION ACTIVITIES BUT- BUT TARGETED GRAZING. CAN AND SHOULD BE A PART OF THAT- USDA HAS THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY INCENTIVES PROGRAM THAT PAYS CARSHARE FOR LANDOWNERS. AND THEY ARE NOW IN CALIFORNIA DOING CAR SHARE ON TARGETED GRAZING WHICH I THINK IS INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGING. AND THEN I THINK THE LAST ISSUE GETS TO THIS IDEA OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS WORK- MANY OF THE CONTRACTS PARTICULARLY. IN MORE THE URBAN AREAS DO REQUIRE SOMEBODY ON SITE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. AND THROUGH- THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF AB TEN SIXTY SIX WHICH WHICH DEALS WITH ACT OVERTIME ISSUES- THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THAT WITH RESPECT TO SHEEPHERDERS. THERE'S AN EASY FIX TO THAT IN TERMS OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT WERE ADOPTED DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT THAT DEAL WITH HURTING REGULATIONS AND I THINK THAT'S A- THE PLACE PERHAPS TO LOOK AT NOT BRINGING FOR STATE PROGRAM IN LINE WITH FEDERAL PROGRAMS AS WELL. WITHOUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THANK YOU. REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR TESTIMONY DAN- AND THE- ONE OF BY OUR OUR OUR FINAL PANELIST OF THE DAY TO SPEAK- CARA HECKERT. CALIFORNIA REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST. I'M THE ONE OUTLINES THE PREMEDITATION ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON. THREE N. AS THE ANCHOR I'M HAPPY TO SWIM FASTER TODAY- SO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN RIVAS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS CARA HECKERT AND THE CALIFORNIA REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST I'M HAPPY TO SEE THIS BIG CONTINGENCY FROM CINEMA AND NAPA AND THE CINEMA COUNTY RESIDENT AND A NAPA VALLEY NATIVE. SO I HAVE A EVACUATED THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE MANY FRIENDS IN AGRICULTURE WHO LOST THEIR VINEYARDS AND THEIR BRANCHES AND FRIENDS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES. SO THIS IS CLOSE TO HOME FOR ME- AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT. WE LIKE TO SAY WE WORK FROM KITCHEN TABLE TO CONGRESS ON PROTECTING FARMLANDS ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND FARMING PRACTICES. AND SUPPORTING A NEW GENERATION OF FARMERS. BUT FOR TODAY FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE BENEFITS OF PROTECTING OUR CALIFORNIA FARMS AND RANCHES AS A WILDFIRE MITIGATION STRATEGY. AM I THE ONE FORTY NEEDS. ABOUT THE MULTIPLE BENEFITS OUR AGRICULTURAL LAND PROVIDES IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED ACCORDING TO RESEARCH ON GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE PROTECTING FARM AND RANCH LAND IS LIKELY TO HAVE THE SINGLE GREATEST IMPACT IN STABILIZING AND REDUCING FUTURE EMISSIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE LAND USES. I OFTEN THINK IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE BLESSED WITH SUCH ABUNDANT AGRICULTURAL LAND THAT WE FREQUENTLY TAKE FOR GRANTED ALL THE BENEFITS THAT LAND PROVIDES AND INCLUDING BEING A CRITICAL TOOL IN COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. NOT ONLY AS A CARBON SINK BUT HOW IT CAN MITIGATE FOR DISASTERS SUCH AS WILDFIRES AMONG A HOST OF OTHER ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS. OKAY TWO SEPARATE SETS OF RESEARCH DEMONSTRATED THE CLEAR CLIMATE BENEFITS THE PROTECTING AGRICULTURAL LANDS HAS IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THIS IS A INCLUDES RESEARCH FROM ALWAYS JACKSON AT UC DAVIS AND AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST. AFT RESEARCH FOUND THAT AVERAGE EMISSIONS FROM URBAN AREAS ARE FIFTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TIMES HIGHER PER ACRE THAN THOSE FROM CROP PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. RELATED TO THIS LOW DENSITY DEVELOPMENT PRODUCES MORE GREENHOUSE GASES PER CAPITA THAN EFFICIENT HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT. URBAN EXPANSION ESPECIALLY LOW DENSITY DEVELOPMENT RESULTS IN THE IRREPLACEABLE LOSS OF FAR MORE FARMLAND THE NECESSARY. OUR RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT CUTTING FARMLAND LOST BY 75% BY TWENTY FIFTY WOULD REDUCE OUR GHG EMISSIONS EQUIVALENT OF TAKING ONE POINT NINE MILLION CARS OFF THE ROAD EACH YEAR. PROTECTING FARMLAND WHILE GROWING CITIES IN A COMPACT MATTER WOULD HAVE THIRTY THREE TONS OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS PER ACRE PER YEAR WHEN COMPARED TO SPRAWL DEVELOPMENT. THIS TYPE OF EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT STABILIZES AND REDUCES FUTURE EMISSIONS WHILE STILL ALLOWING THE STATE ECONOMY TO EXPAND. AND HOUSING GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED. IT'S NOT WHETHER WE NEED TO GROW ITS HOW WE GROW. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERING CALIFORNIA'S GOAL OF REDUCING STATEWIDE GHG EMISSIONS BY 80% BY TWENTY FIFTY. SAYS MANY FOLKS HAVE SAID BEFORE AGAS TRULY PART OF THE SOLUTION AND COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. IN ADDITION AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE FROM THE FROM THE PRIOR SPEAKERS. AGRICULTURAL LAND TO SUSTAINABLY MANAGE FARM AND RANCH LAND PROVIDES A HOST OF ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS. BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP WITH WILDFIRE PREVENTION SOMETIMES WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT AS DIRECTLY AS IT ACTUALLY IS. IRRIGATED CROPLAND JUST LIKE IN THE CASE OF CINEMA COUNTY CAN BE UTILIZED AS A FIRE BREAK. INCREASED WATER SUPPLIES FROM GROUNDWATER RECHARGE ZONES CAN INCREASE FIRE FOR FIRE PREVENTION. AND CLEARLY WHEN WE USE MORE REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. I AM IT'S SMART AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES HEALTHY SOILS PRACTICES. WE ARE ABLE TO MULTIPLY THAT BENEFITS MANY TIMES OVER. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO BOTH. NOT ALL REMAINING FARMLAND IS IDEAL FOR AGRICULTURE HOWEVER SOMETIMES CONSIDERED A CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENT TO SAY THAT BUT STRESS ON WATER SUPPLIES UNSUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND UNFORESEEN TEMPERATURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE DEPLETE THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH QUALITY FARMLAND IN CALIFORNIA. THEREFORE PROTECTING THE BEST FARMLAND THAT'S LEFT THE MOST PRODUCTIVE VERSATILE AND RESILIENT IS PARAMOUNT. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES MORE THAN ONE MILLION ACRES OF CALIFORNIA FARMLAND HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM AGRICULTURE. REPRESENTING A DEVASTATING LOSS AND AGRICULTURAL CAPACITY. EACH YEAR CALIFORNIA LOSES THE AVERAGE OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND THE EQUIVALENT OF MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF TIMES THE AREA OF SAN FRANCISCO. HALF OF THIS LOSS IS TAKING PLACE ON THE STATE'S MOST PRODUCTIVE FARMLAND WHICH IS OFTEN LOCATED AT THE URBAN EDGE WHERE IT'S MOST VULNERABLE TO THE EFFECTS. OF URBAN SPRAWL. IF THAT CURRENT DEVELOPMENT TREND CONTINUES ANOTHER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ACRES WILL BE LOST BY MID CENTURY. USING A FARMLAND CONSERVATION SCENARIO WHICH IS IN GREEN. WHICH IS THAT THIS IS THE MODEL FROM AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST. IF WE SUSTAIN FUNDING FOR STATE PROGRAMS SUCH AS A STABLE ADVANCE CONSERVATION PROGRAM THROUGH DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION. AND CALIFORNIA FARM LAND CONSERVANCY PROGRAM AND ADOPT LOCAL M. AG LAND MITIGATION AND OTHER PROTECTION POLICIES. THAT'S WHERE WE CAN STEM THE LOSS OF FARMLAND. WE KNOW FROM RECENT RESEARCH BY CALIFORNIA RANGELANDS TRUSTS. THAT THEIR APPROVING ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT. THAT THE ECOSYSTEMS SERVICE SERVICES PROVIDE ONE PROTECTED. THE RECENT STUDY SAID JUST A LITTLE OVER OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES THAT THEY HAVE EASEMENT ON PROVIDES ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ANNUALLY. MORE SPECIFICALLY AG LAND PROTECTION IS KEY TO HELPING US MITIGATE FOR INCREASED NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS WILDFIRES. BUT THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF THAT MEDICATION IS A LITTLE KNOWN OR QUANTIFIED. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT WE REALLY COULD WORK WITH ALL OF YOU ON HOW DO WE QUANTIFY THE BENEFITS THAT ALL THESE THINGS ARE PROVIDING. IT IS NO DOUBT EXPONENTIALLY GREATER IMPACT. SO IN CLOSING. I GREW CULTURAL LAND PROTECTION CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE WILDFIRE MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDE A SERIES OF CO BENEFITS IT'S CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS TO PROTECT OUR AGRICULTURAL LAND AND ALSO TO HELP MANAGE THEM RESPONSIBLY. AND WITH THAT I'LL CLOSE THANK YOU. MISS PARKER THANK YOU SO MUCH WELCOME TO. GET INFORMATION THE- FIVE QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- LET MY QUESTION IS GO TO- MISTER MAKAN- YOU'D MENTIONED- SB NINE A ONE FUNDS WITH CAL FIRE IN. ALL OF THAT- COULD YOU GIVE US SOME SOME NUMBERS ON YOU KNOW ACRE DEGREES TO WHERE- IN THEN THE COST OF THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS WE CAN HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TO SCALE. ABSOLUTELY THEN I HAVE A ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON WHAT YOU HAD MENTIONED WITH THE HIGHLY SKILLED LABOR AS WELL OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. WITH RESPECT TO THE COST OF DOING THIS KIND OF WORK IN CANADA THE NUMBER OF ACRES GRAZED I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GET- AN INVENTORY ON OURSELVES WITHIN UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. ON THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EFFORTS TO MATCH GRAZER'S UP WITH PLACES THAT NEED NEED THAT SERVICE THE RACE FOR DOING THAT WORK REALLY VERY BY THE TYPE OF TERRAIN AND BY ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE OF THE PROJECT INVOLVED. WE'RE SEEING THOSE RATES RANGE FROM AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AN ACRE. AND A LARGER SCALE EASILY ACCESSIBLE PROJECTS. TO UPWARDS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE WERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET ANIMALS IN SAFELY AND- IN TO DO THE KIND OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT THAT THAT ALSO DID VERY IS DEPENDS RIGHT DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF RISK AND- COMPLEXITY WITH SOME OF THE MORE URBAN SITES THAT FOLKS ARE WORKING IN TWO. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN- YOU'D MENTIONED WITH THE- ON THE LABOR SIDE- SOME OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS. THE WILL YOU PLEASE EXPAND ON THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT- CARVE OUTS FOR OTHER THINGS AND DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON OVER OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SO. I THINK IT WOULD HELP THE COMMITTEE AND ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THIS. HIGHLY SKILLED WORK FORCE IN AND EXACTLY HOW THIS WORKS BECAUSE THEY ARE. ON SITE YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR SEVEN- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES SOME OF THESE ERRORS ARE A REALLY REMOTE AND HARD TO GET TO SO IT ARE NOT EXACTLY ON A NORMAL EIGHT TO FIVE O'CLOCK- SO PLEASE EXPAND. ABSOLUTELY AND ERIC YOU KNOW ANY ANY ANYBODY THAT'S BEEN AROUND LIVESTOCK KNOWS THAT- THAT THEY DON'T PUNCH A CLOCK EITHER AND SO THE WORK. THE WORK NEEDS TO HAPPEN- WHEN IT'S IN FRONT OF US WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- THERE HAS BEEN- A FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FOR. SHEEPHERDERS AND GROCERS IN PARTICULAR WHO ARE WORKING IN THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS- WHILE THEY ARE. LIVING AND WORKING. WITH THAT WITH THAT PARTICULAR OPERATION. THE FEDERAL PROGRAM RECOGNIZES THAT THEY WORK A FORTY EIGHT HOUR WORK WEEK- CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THAT WORK WEEK ENTAILS AND THAT'S WHERE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF THE OF AB TEN SIXTY SIX COME INTO PLAY- UNDER CALIFORNIA DEFINITION- IT'S A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT HOUR WORK WEEK. AND SO ONCE THAT THAT LEGISLATION IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED- THE INITIAL YEAR OF THAT WOULD INCREASE COSTS BY OVER 60% AND. AND GO UP FROM THERE- WITH IN THE- PROGRAM IT IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE ACTUAL WORK THAT IS BEING DONE ON THE LANDSCAPE AND SO THAT PARTICULAR. DEFINITION IN TERMS OF FORTY EIGHT HOURS IS ALSO MORE IN LINE WITH WARY BE TURNED SIXTY SIX- WOULD BE WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AS WELL. SO WOULD WOULD YOU SEE THAT AS SOMETHING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADJUST TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT IT. YOU KNOW FOR THE INSTANCES OF. THESE TYPES ARE HEARD IN THIS TYPE OF WORK FORCE. TO FOLLOW THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES VERSUS THE STATE GUIDELINES I MEAN HOW HOW. HOW WOULD WE NEED TO GO ABOUT FIXING THAT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO USE- IN IN CONTINUE USE OF THIS TYPE OF FIRE MITIGATION SO THAT WAY THIS DOESN'T. END UP LEAVING THE STATE LIKE OTHER THINGS. SO THE- INITIAL CALIFORNIA INTERPRETATION WAS MADE ADMINISTRATIVELY AND SO IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- THIS THIS NEW ADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATION TO BRING CALIFORNIA'S POLICY IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL INTERPRETATION. WHAT COULD BE DONE TO ADMINISTRATIVELY IT WOULD NOT NOT THEIRS AS I UNDERSTAND IT REQUIRE LEGISLATION TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. THANK YOU THANK YOU. LEVINE QUESTION. YEAH YOU MIGHT WANNA TAKE A SEAT. THANK YOU. BUT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW. EVEN ON ZOOM I STILL HAVE IT ON IT ALL THE TIME SO YOU'D MENTION THE USE OF THE SHEEP AND REALLY WE'VE SEEN IT IN- KIND OF THE MORE DEVELOPED AREAS WHICH WHEN I TALK TO IT'S A FIREFIGHTING PROFESSIONALS AND THAT'S REALLY THE RISK IS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT THESE MASSIVE EVENTS THAT DO OCCUR AND HAVE REALLY HURT THE NORTH BAY AND OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA BUT THE RISK IS THESE. DEVELOPED AREAS HOUSE TO HOUSE MEMBERS WHICH WE'VE SEEN IN THE BIG BIG EVENTS BUT BUT CERTAINLY HAPPENS ON EVERYDAY BASIS AND- AND THAT THE THAT THE SHEEP IN THE WORK THAT THEY DO PROTECT AGAINST- THAT SPREADING MORE MASSIVELY IS WE'VE WE'VE SEEN AND I THINK THERE TO REALLY GREAT EXTENT IN A BIG FIRE SITUATION IT WAS ILLUSTRATED- IN CINEMA CLOSE TO SAN PABLO BAY NEAR THIS THE CINEMA RACEWAY- WHERE- WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY DEVASTATING EVENT AND CERTAINLY WAS THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE NORTH BAY THAT NIGHT'S- WAS ABLE TO YOU KNOW FIGHT BACK THAT FIRE. PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT SHE HAD DONE OVER MANY YEARS. AND IT WAS A IT WAS A REALLY POSITIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE POWER. OF THAT OF USING SHEEP IN THIS WAY. HAVE YOU SEEN UN GROWTH OR EVEN OVER SUBSCRIPTION AND WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE TO SCALE IF THERE IS DEMAND FOR THAT- IN THE STATE IS BIGGEST CALIFORNIA. WE ARE SEEING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GROWTH- IN THAT BOTH IN TERMS OF EXISTING OPERATIONS THAT ARE ARE KIND OF EXPANDING WHAT THEY DO IN THAT REGARD IN AND FRANKLY NEW OPERATIONS GETTING INTO THE BUSINESS. I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES ARM AS WE GROW THAT SEGMENT OF THE OF THE GRAZING BUSINESS IS TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE IN AND KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO DO IT EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY- PARTICULARLY IN A MORE URBAN LANDSCAPE- IT'S ONE THING TO BE TO BE GRAZING SHEEP OR I DO WHERE THERE'S NOBODY AROUND. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO BE MANAGING LIVESTOCK IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S- THOUSANDS ARE IF NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND ALL THE POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT THAT GOES WITH THAT. I THINK- I THINK THE OTHER OPPORTUNITY IN THAT REGARD THAT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON IS WE'VE GOT THIS WINDOW WHERE WE NEED TO TREAT FUELS- YOU KNOW FROM STARTING IN THE SOUTH MAYBE IN FEBRUARY ON UP INTO JUNE AND JULY AND AUGUST UP UP IN THIS PART OF THE STATE- BUT THAT STILL LEAVES SEVERAL MONTHS WHERE WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FEED THOSE LIVESTOCK OTHER PLACES. AND SO BEING ABLE TO COORDINATE THAT WERE WE'VE GOT WINTER GRAZING- TO MAINTAIN THOSE KINDS OF FLOCKS AND HERDS I THINK IS A ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR US IN AND IS FAR AS MANAGING AND HOUSING THERE HEARD ARE THEY IN RESIDENTS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN THEY GET ON THAT TRAILER GO TO THE NEXT JOB OR THEY GO BACK OUT TO TAMALA SPARE OF THE PLASTER AND GO BACK TO WHERE THEY WOULD LIVE IN IN THEIR OFF SEASON IF YOU WILL OR IS THERE A CONSTANT STREAM OF WORK BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT IT ALL THE TIME ANYHOW. THEY ABSOLUTELY THEY DON'T YOU DON'T SHUT THEM OFF AND PUT HIM IN THE SHED WHEN THEY'RE DONE WORK AND- I THINK WHAT WE WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT THAT WERE KIND OF REBUILDING THE OLD- PNEUMATIC SYSTEM OF LIVESTOCK GRAZING IN THAT THESE FLOCKS AND HERDS ARE TYPICALLY ON TARGETED GRAZING PROJECTS FROM FEBRUARY THROUGH MAYBE SEPTEMBER- AND THEN TYPICALLY THEY'LL GO TO A HOME RANCHER HOME BASE- KIND OF. GET YOU KNOW DO ALL THAT THE HEALTH WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO WITH THEIR ANIMALS- RECUPERATE FROM BEING ON THE ROAD BUT THEY'RE GOING FROM PROJECT TO PROJECT THERE ARE HARD SHEEP AND GOATS THAT'LL BE IN PLASTER COUNTY IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH THAT WILL THEN COME DOWN TO YOUR PART OF THE WORLD- LATER IN THE YEAR AND KIND OF JUST CONTINUING MAKE THAT CIRCUIT. GRATEFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE A QUESTION FROM A SOCCER. RIGHT FROM THE BACK OF THE ROOM. THANK YOU IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU I'M NOT MY QUESTION WAS THE TREND LINES ON CONSERVATION- AND CONVERSION AND- IN AND LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR AN IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND EVEN. FIRE BREAKS AND FIRE PREVENTION- AND EVEN AYE I WOULD TAKE IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL OUR OPPORTUNITY SET THAT CARBON SEQUESTRATION- BECAUSE OF LAND MANAGEMENT TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT- D. THE TREND LINES DON'T TELL US WHERE THIS IS OCCURRING. GEOGRAPHICALLY AND- AND HOW- IT. WHETHER THIS IS A CANTON LIKE APPROACH PIECEMEAL APPROACH TO IT TO THIS CONVERSION OR IF IT THERE IS A SOME TYPE OF THE PHYSICAL- YOU KNOW GEOGRAPHICAL STRATEGY OF WE'RE OR NOT TRAGIC THAT RATIONALE FOR WHY CERTAIN LAND IS COMING OUT OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND- AND WITH IT AND IF ON A MAP. THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE TO US WHERE IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO- IN VANCE- AGRICULTURAL LAND PROTECTIONS- BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF- OF DESTROYING WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE. BOTH AGRICULTURALLY IMPORTANT LAND ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPORTANT LAND BUT ALSO FROM A FIRE BREAK PERSPECTIVE- OPENING THAT UP AS WELL AND TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S DATA TO SUPPORT. I'VE GOT MAPS I'VE GOTTA. I JUST AHEAD FIVE MINUTE YEAH. I HAD- THERE'S NO. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND A HALF T. DID A NATIONAL REPORT CALLED FARMING ON THE EDGE- THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT IN PARTICULAR THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WAS IN THE TOP TEN IN THE IN THE NATION AND ACTUALLY THAT'S WHY WE ESTABLISHED OUR FIRST OFFICE IN VISALIA. BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WERE NOT THERE ANYMORE- BUT- YEAH AND I WOULD ALSO SAY OF PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THOSE ARE THE THAT THE TWO THAT ARE ALWAYS AT THE TOP- OTHER REGIONS IS IT KIND OF A COUNTY BY COUNTY. BASIS OBVIOUSLY LOCAL LAND USE POLICY AND HOW THAT IS- SUPPORTED. PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN FARMLAND LOSS AND ALSO THE ECONOMICS OF THE AREA I MEAN IT IF THERE'S A CITY OR A TOWN THAT NEEDS TO DEVELOP TO KEEP THEIR ECONOMIC ENGINE GOING AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE INCENTIVES. TO STAY IN FARMING AND FARMERS DON'T HAVE A SUCCESSOR AND THEY NEED TO SELL TO A DEVELOPER BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR MAIN OPTION SO THERE'S MANY MANY FACTORS BUT WE COULD CERTAINLY HELP YOU- PRIORITIZE. IF THAT WOULD BE NEEDED BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO SAVE ALL THE FARM LAND THAT WE HAVE AND- IN THE LOSS IN CONVERGENCE COULD BE RETAIL HOUSING DORMANCY ANY NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS TO YEAH. REALLY RURAL RANCH THAT'S- ARE THE NUMBER ONE LOW DENSITY HOUSING I WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEW I. REPORT THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR CALLED FARMS UNDER THREAT. AND IT DEFINITELY IS LOW DENSITY. SPRAWL MORE THAN URBAN DENSITY DEVELOPMENT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME GREAT TO FEEL. GREAT QUESTIONS APPRECIATE THE- THE DIALOGUE AND RESPONSES- THIS. AT THIS POINT AN INTEREST OF TIME WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO- TO PUBLIC COMMENT IF. WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME PUBLIC COMMENTS YOU'RE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES YOU'RE WELCOME. TO APPROACH THE MICROPHONE. BECAUSE STATE YOUR NAME AND- WHERE FROM WOULD BE HELPFUL. HI MY NAME IS SANDRA HAD STRONG AND- I ACTUALLY CURRENTLY LIVE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY- BUT THIS TOPIC OF FIRES IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ME BECAUSE I WAS LIVING IN SONOMA COUNTY IN THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA WHEN THE TUBBS FIRE DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES IN OCTOBER SEVENTEEN. AS A RESULT OF TUBS ME AND MY FAMILY OF SIX INCLUDING MY FOUR CHILDREN WERE DISPLACED AND WERE FORCED TO MOVE TO SACRAMENTO COUNTY I'M I'M ACTUALLY A GOAT FARMERS WELL. THREE OF MY CHILDREN ACTUALLY GAVE TESTIMONY RECENTLY HERE IN THIS BUILDING AND HEARING ABOUT USING. CONTROLLED BURNS TO CONTROL. AND MANAGE FIRE UP FIRES. LISTEN MY CHILDREN GAVE TESTIMONY IT WAS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT THING FOR ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK AS IT BROUGHT UP THE HORRORS OF THOSE DAYS AND THE WEEKS THAT OUR SANTA ROSA COMMUNITY AND TOWARD. BECAUSE THAT WAS SUCH AN INTENSE- HEARING FOR ME I ASKED A FRIEND TO JOIN YOU TODAY FOR MORAL SUPPORT. SO I INVITED A FRIEND FROM SHASTA COUNTY TODAY TO JOIN ME IN THIS HEARING BECAUSE HIS AREA HAS ALSO BEEN HARD HIT WITH FIRES AS WELL INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY WITH THE DOG FIRE WHERE TWO OF HIS NEIGHBORS DIED A MOTHER AND HER EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER OF A FAMILY OF FIVE. BUT MY FRIEND IS NOT HERE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE WAS PREVENTED FROM RE ENTERING THE BUILDING THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE HE HAD NOT COVERED HIS NOSE WITH HIS MASK DURING THE MORNING HEARING AND APPARENTLY THAT QUALIFIES HIM AS BEING BANISHED FROM THE BUILDING SOMEHOW. SO I'M STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW AS HIS PROXY TRYING TO GIVE TESTIMONY OF THE HEARTBREAKING LOSS THAT HIS NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS IN TOWARD WHEN TWO MEMBERS OF A FIVE MEMBER FAMILY DIED IN THIS AUG FIRE THE MOTHER AND THE EIGHT YEAR OLD GIRL. AND I'M HONESTLY WONDERING RIGHT AT THE MOMENT WHAT KIND OF THE UNIVERSE I'M LIVING IN BECAUSE MY FRIEND IN SUPPORT PERSON WHO DROVE HOURS AND HUNDREDS OF MILES IN FACT TO JOIN ME TODAY GOT KICKED OUT OF PARTICIPATORY GOVERNMENT FOR NOT COVERING HIS NOSE. WHEN HIS DESIRE TO BE IN THIS BUILDING WAS DUE TO WANTING TO GIVE TESTIMONY OF THE TRAGIC PREVENTABLE DEATH OF A FRIEND AND HER EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN YET ANOTHER OF THESE CRIMINAL FIRES. SO COULD I HAVE TWO MORE MINUTES TO READ WHAT HE HAD PLANNED TO READ ABOUT THESE PEOPLE THAT DIED PLEASE. BECAUSE COVER HIS NOSE. OKAY IF YOU WANT TO USE THE TWO MINUTES. I'M FINE WITH THAT WE NOW KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE REMAINING TWOS AUG FIRE VICTIMS JUST FROM SEPTEMBER A MOTHER AND A DAUGHTER WHO LIVED ON ARCHER ROAD A LAND IN THE CLOUD AND HER DAUGHTER EIGHT YEAR OLD FEY LOWER AT THEIR HOME THE DAY THE FIRE BROKE OUT. THE DAY OF THE FIRE ROB SUSIE AND ZAC WERE OUT OF CELL SERVICE COLLECTING LADY BUGS FOR THEIR COMPANY WELL LANA AND FEY LOWER ON THEIR HOME ON ARCHER ROAD THIS AUG FIRE WAS RAGING SO FAST ARCHER ROAD PEOPLE WERE SCRAMBLING TO GET OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE A LAN AND FEHLER TRIED TO ESCAPE. AND WE'RE DRIVING OUT OF THE FIRE BUT THE SMOKE WAS SO THICK YOU COULDN'T EVEN SEE THEIR HAND IN FRONT OF THEIR FACE. IN THE DEBT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT- I NEED TO REMEMBER FOUND. SO WE DID NOT MAKE IT OUT ROB STUDENTS ACTED WAITED NEARLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GIRLS BEFORE THE CORONER TOLD THEM THE NEWS A FULL DAY LATER AND I ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES BECAUSE ALL I GOT OUT ALIVE. I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES BECAUSE MY FAMILY GOT OUT ALIVE. AND I'M SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THIS WONDERING. CALL ME SKEPTICAL BUT WHAT YOU THE LEGISLATURE WHATWILL YOU END UP DOING SET UP ANOTHER TASK FORCE ANOTHER COMMITTEE ADD TO THE CALIFORNIA CARBON PLAN HIRE MORE ASK EXPERTS WITH OUR MONEY WHEN YOU UP SO OBVIOUSLY FAILED US WITH YOUR POLICIES UP UNTIL NOW AND WE ARE SUPPOSED TO JUST SIT BACK AND TRUST YOU SORRY I DON'T FOR ONE MOMENT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS HEARING IS HAPPENING DECADES TOO LATE FROM THE ONGOING CORRUPTION WITH THE CPUC AND YOUR RADICAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES INCLUDING YOUR TIES TO PG&amp;E NOT TO MENTION YOUR BLOOD MONEY CONNECTIONS TO A CONVICTED FELON POWER MONOPOLY PG&amp;E I DO NOT TRUST. TO MANAGER WITH THE FIRE ISSUE MEMOS TWO MINUTES THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU COULD TAKE YOUR NAME AND WHERE YOU RESIDE PLEASE. INTERVIEW I GOT MAJOR MINUTES FEDERAL BANK- I SHOULD SAY I HAPPEN TO SPEAK WITH THE OFFICE- I SHOULD SAY HOW MUCH I ADMIRE THE COURAGE I HAVE YOU KNOW IN OUR STATE THE A PRACTICAL WISDOM YOU'LL HAVE. IN A- BUT THE AUTHORITY HAVING THIS ROOM OF OURS. THE- CLARITY OF RATIONALE A CLARITY OF THINKING THAT YOU ARE A PROVIDER SINCE. MANDA IN SACRAMENTO I- I CAN HEAR THAT MANY. COSTS ACTUALLY ALSO THAT I MARK OUR DEMOCRACY SOME PRETTY MUCH. AND AND I FEEL LIKE I GOVERNMENTS FEEL GOOD DECENT PEOPLE I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY ARE IN THE JOB THEY DO I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO. WHO ARE ELECTED THERE'S THAT HAD PUT ME. IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SENTIMENT SEMINAL COUNTY- I CAN HEAR THE MANY OF YOU HAVE YOU ALL HAVE EXPERIENCE REAL LOSS I DON'T DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE HURTS IN YOUR HEARTS AND I DON'T DOUBT THAT YOU WISH THE PAIN. WOULD GO AWAY. AND IT WON'T. BUT SOON NAY. IT'S A REAL HORROR IN CALIFORNIA. I HEARD THE STORY FARMER. WHO'S CAL WAS BURNED. WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT AND THE BABY CALF. WITH RUNNING. CYCLING HER MOTHER IN SPIRIT WITH. HI I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FIRES THE MOST CONCERN ABOUT FIRES BURNING OUR STATE CALLED BIOTECHNOLOGY OR NANOTECHNOLOGY AND I'M VERY CONCERNED. BECAUSE OF MY LIFE PERSONALLY AND IT'S NOT IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'VE BASICALLY BEEN. HAS NOT CLOSER BUT I'VE BEEN TORTURED FOR ELEVEN STRAIGHT SIX ONE STRAIGHT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FIVE MONTHS STRAIGHT TORMENT AND YOU KNOW I HAVE A POLICE REPORT FROM THE SX SERVICE DEPARTMENT TALK ABOUT HOW I HAD YOU KNOW PEOPLE BRINGS MY APARTMENT PUT CHEMICALS ON MY FLOOR CHEMICALS OFF MY VEHICLE. TOPPLED DRUG ON MY DOORKNOB THAT YOU KNOW WAS THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF BRAIN VIRUS AND I YOU KNOW IT'S NOT POURING SOME NOBODY SPECIAL INTERESTS I'M NOBODY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS OPERATED THESE KIND OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO CHILDREN NOT NOT WAS HAVING ME. BUT ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENED WE COULD HAVE YOUR TALKS WHEN I JUST WANT TO KNOW DO YOU REALIZE HOW SERIOUS THIS IS. I'M NOT HERE TO BLAME ANYONE I FEEL LIKE WE YEAH I HAVE COMPASSION FOR EVERYONE I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO BRING US THROUGH. YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE CHILDREN THE BEATING THE MEDICINE LOVE OUR LIVES I FEEL LIKE FAMILIES AND CHILDREN EVERYTHING TO US ALL OF US SO WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT. I DON'T WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME IF YOU COULD WRAP UP IN THE NEXT. TWENTY SECONDS. THAT'S TWO MINUTES. I FEEL THE- RESPONSE. FOR CAN PER. I FEEL LIKE WE CAN WORK. TO MAKE THIS. BECAUSE ALL OF US. WHOEVER'S CAN PROVIDE. SCHOOLS WITH RAW ANIMAL ORGANS. FROM SHEEP AND PIGS AND COWS BECAUSE OF ENZYMES CAN IMPEDE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE STATIC BIO AND- CHEMICAL. NANO DEVICES. THEY CAN ALSO PROVIDE METAL BARS OF APPROXIMATELY LARGE ENOUGH REACH COMMUNITIES CHILDREN. THANK YOU SIR. THEY CAN PROVIDE PEOPLE CAN I GET A VERY PROMINENT IN CUSTODY WITHIN SUCH AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO. PROSECUTORS ALL INFORMATION ASK. OUR PERHAPS. WHAT I'M TRYING. TO REMEMBER GRADUATION PROCESS. IF THERE ARE A MEMBERS IN THE AUDIENCE WHO LIKE TO MAKE COMMENTS A GALA TO ME NOW THE TIME TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS. IF YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND THAT WAY FROM FOR THE RECORD PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT MEETING TODAY AT SHINING SOME LIGHT ON THE IMPACTS OF THESE DEATHS DEVASTATING WILDFIRES TO CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS. MY NAME IS KIRK WILDER I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING MORE THAN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED CATTLE RANCHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING OF COURSE DOCTOR DAVE DALY WHO YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE IMPACTS THAT YOU HEARD FROM DAVE ALL DEVASTATING ARE NOT UNIQUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE HEARD SIMILAR DEVASTATION ABOUT RANGELAND BURNING UP. HERS BURNING UP- AND LOSING FIFTH OR SIXTH GENERATION RANCHING LEGACIES IN THE STATE FROM THE CREEK FIRE RESCUE FIRE THREE AUGUST COMPLEX FIRES AND ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF TWENTY TWENTY ON AGRICULTURE WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE PREVENT. TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIRE SEASON ARE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SEASON FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. I WANT UNDERSCORE THAT CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION. ARE RANGERS AND RANGERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ARE EAGER TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON FINDING THOSE SOLUTIONS THIS YEAR. ABOUT A THIRD OF THE STATE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ACRES. ARE RANGELANDS THEY'RE OWNED OR MANAGED BY RANCHERS- WE HEARD FROM DAVID FROM DAN MAKING TODAY THERE'S BASICALLY. TWO ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS TO REDUCING FIRE FUELS FROM THE LANDSCAPE. THAT IS GRAYSON. HAS PRESCRIBED FIRE. WE'VE PROVIDED YOU A LETTER IN YOUR COMMITTEE PACKAGE DATA TALKS ABOUT SOME THIRTY THOUSAND FORTY. FIVE PERSPECTIVES ON HOW WE CAN GO ABOUT. INCREASING PRESCRIBED FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE INCREASING GRAZING ON THE LANDSCAPE IN THE COMING LEGISLATIVE SESSION. WE'RE EAGER TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON FINDING THOSE SOLUTIONS. ARE REAL QUICK I JUST WANT TO DIG A LITTLE DEEPER ON THOSE TWO ISSUES. WE'D LIKE TO SEE INCREASED GRAZING ON STATE LANDS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE IS LIMITED GRAZING ON STATE PARKS AND DFW LAMBS- BUT BECAUSE GRAZING CAN BE USED TO REDUCE THOSE FINE FUEL LOADS. WE'D LIKE TO SEE AN EXPANDED. ADDITIONALLY YOU KNOW. PRESCRIBED FIRES GOING TO BE A KEY TOOL. FIVE TO SOLVING OUR WILDFIRE ISSUES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE'VE SEEN FROM OUR FIRE EXPERTS WE CONSULTED ARE FAR SUBCOMMITTEE. IS THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS A- SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY FOR SIDES PRESCRIBED BURNS WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT CHANGE TO PERHAPS A GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD. AGAIN THERE ARE FURTHER. OPPORTUNITIES OUTLINED IN OUR LETTER TO YOU AND CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION. AND OUR MEMBERS STATEWIDE ARE EAGER TO PARTNER WITH YOU. ON FINDING FIRE SOLUTIONS IN THE COMING YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS ANYONE ELSE. FOR PUBLIC. COMMENTS LIMITED TWO MINUTES. TO HAVE TO CHECK. PHONE LINES IF THERE'S NO OKAY. SO WITH THAT I DON'T SEE THE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO GET PROMISE I DO WANNA THANK VICE CHAIR MATHIS FOR MAKING TIME TO BE HERE WITH US THIS AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE. I KNOW OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYWOMAN CECILIA AGUILAR CURRY I INTENDED TO BE HERE SHE HAD A CONFLICT ON HER CALENDAR. BUT I CERTAINLY THINK ALL OF OUR- MEMBERS THAT. THAT DISSIPATED ON OUR PANELS- THIS AFTERNOON IT IS WAS IT YOU KNOW INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE- IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING HOW WILDFIRES HAVE IMPACTED OUR STATE- AND ESPECIALLY HOW IT IMPACTS AGRICULTURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO DO OR NEED TO DO A LOT MORE. WITH A LOT LESS NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE RESOURCES- THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE FUNDING- BUT I BELIEVE THAT. WE CAN DO IT THE SO LONG AS WE HAVE EXPERTS WE HAVE RESEARCHERS FARMERS WE HAVE FARMWORKERS- THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. AND YOU KNOW TACKLING THIS ISSUE IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. BUT CLEARLY- WE MUST WORK TOGETHER IF WE WANT TO MAKE A LASTING- AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IMPACTFUL PUBLIC POLICY- WE WILL TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED THIS AFTERNOON WE WILL CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS- TO CRAFT SOLUTIONS THAT WILL BRING ALL OF US BACK TOGETHER. A TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS- AND SO WITH THAT THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR MAKING THE TIME. AND I. HOPE YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD HOLIDAY SEASON AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU GUYS EARLY NEXT YEAR FOR ACCESSION.
