THE CONSULTANT A QUORUM IS MENACED OUR SOON OKAY LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR- THIS IS AB THREE TO SIX AND CENTER ALLEN UNDERSTAND YOU'RE PRESENTING A. B. THREE TO SIX FOR ASSEMBLY MAN MURATSUCHI AND YOU HAVE AMENDMENTS WHICH YOU LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO ACCEPT PLEASE BEGAN CENTER YOU HAVE THE FLOOR THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I I'M I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUE. ASSUME MEMBER CITY WAS SENT- PORTIONS OF THE CITY OF TORRANCE AND SEVEN CALIFORNIA AND YES WE WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE MOMENTS THAT ARE NOTED ON PAGE PAGE SIX OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND- PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN THIS IS IMPORTANT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS NEGOTIATED OVER THE WEEKEND THEY CALLED IT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO ALL OF YOUR OFFICE IS IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE AMENDMENTS. I'VE BEEN TO YOU WITH THE PROPOSED I MEAN FOR CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION OF NOW ACTUALLY SUBMITTED A LETTER IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THIS I JUST WANT TO TAKE UP TO THINK THAT. IN COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE WORK THAT THEY HAVE ENGAGED IN. TO IMPROVE THIS LEGISLATION OVER THE PAST MONTH. I REMEMBER SURVEYS SHOW THAT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE NOT OWN AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE ARE HESITANT TO PURCHASE ONE BECAUSE OF THE COST. AND UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE TECHNOLOGY. CONCERNS WITH THE RANGE THAT A VEHICLE CAN TRAVEL BETWEEN CHARGES IN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW AND WHERE TO CHARGE A VEHICLE. AND GIVEN THE BROAD GOALS THAT WE HAVE IS A STATUS ARE STRONG FEELING THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS. TO DO MORE TO REDUCE EACH OF THESE BARRIERS SO THIS BILL AB THREE TWENTY SIX BY. THE SUMMER MURATSUCHI WILL HELP. BY PROVIDING ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS THE AUTHORITY TO OFFER THEIR EDIE'S TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH A STE FOR. MONTHS A MONTH MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENT INSTEAD OF THROUGH TRADITIONAL SALE LEASE OR RENTAL METHODS. AS A RESULT OF COVER NINETEEN CALIFORNIA SHED A RECORD TWO POINT THREE FOUR MILLION JOBS RESULTING IN A FIFTEEN POINT FIVE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THESE DIRE ECONOMIC NUMBERS HAVE TRANSLATED. INTO DECLINES IN NEW CAR SALES OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. MANY CONCURRENT DECREASE IN STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAXES. THE CURRENT VIRUS ALSO DECIMATED CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET ALL BUT ENSURING THE TV AND SENATE SUCH AS CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAMS OF YOUR P. WILL BE ELIMINATED. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT PLUNGING NEW CAR SALES. AND THE ELIMINATION OF STATE EVEY INCENTIVE WILL MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. FOR THE STATE TO MEET ITS GOAL OF FIVE MILLION THE VIS BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND SO IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT ESTABLISHING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. WILL COST THE STATE VERY LITTLE WHILE PROVIDING CALIFORNIA DRIVERS ACCESS TO MONTHLY MEMBERSHIPS. WHICH WILL BE PRICE LOWER THAN THE COST OF MANY LEASE AGREEMENTS END WHICH THEY CAN CANCEL WITHOUT. FINANCIAL PENALTIES. IN THIS WILL HELP TO RIGHT THE SHIP WITH REGARDS TO OUR PLANS TO GET MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON TO THE ROAD. ALSO UNDER THIS NEW LEGAL FRAMEWORK DRIVERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM COMPREHENSIVE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. MANUFACTURES OFFERING MEMBERSHIPS MAJID HERE TO ROBUST VEHICLE RECALL PROVISIONS AND FOLLOW ALL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. MEMBERS THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH SAFE. LOWER COST OPTION TO GET INTO THE V. WITHOUT RISKY FINANCING A LONG TERM COMMITMENTS. THAT'S GIVING PEOPLE MORE FAMILIARITY WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY AND IN A IN A LOWER KEY MANNER. PROVIDES EVEY BENEFACTORS AWAY TO SUCCESSFULLY MARKET THIRTY VIS DURING CHALLENGE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES IT HELPS TO OFFSET THE LOST OF A C. EUROPEAN CENTERS AT ALMOST NO COST TO THE STATE. ANNA HELPS CALIFORNIA MINUTES GOAL OF HAVING FIVE MILLION VIEWS ON OUR ROADS BY TWENTY THIRTY THE BILL SUPPORTED BY CONSUMERS FOR ON A ROUTE LARA BILL AND SEE. THE LA ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL NUMEROUS AND GROUPS SUCH AS COMFORTABLY CONSERVATION VOTERS CLUB AS WELL AS OF COURSE EVEY MANUFACTURES. ALL RIGHT NOW THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS GOING TO A ARGUE THAT ONLY BENEFITS ONE COMPANY THIS IS SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE. YES A CALIFORNIA EVEY MANUFACTURE CANOE IS THE LEGISLATION SPONSOR. BUT TV COMPANY REVIEW N. AS IN SUPPORT OTHER EATING THAT AFFECTIONS LIKE FERRET A LUCID ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE. FOR THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL. THE OPPOSITION'S ALSO COULD ARGUE THAT MANUFACTURES COULD DO THIS UNDER CURRENT LAW IF THEY JUST GOT A CAR DEALERS LICENSE. BUT THESE MANUFACTURES ARE NOT SELLING CARS THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT. GONNA HAVE BRICK AND MORTAR STORE THE CONSUMER TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE. IN AS OPPONENTS KNOW DEALERSHIPS ARE TECHNIQUE FORBIDDEN FROM OFFERING MONTH TO MONTH MEMBERSHIPS BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS IN LEASING. AND VEHICLE RENTAL LOSS. UNDER THIS BILL EVEY MANUFACTURES WILL OWN MAINTAIN AND EVEN HELP FACILITATE. THE CHARGING OF THE VEHICLES THEY ARE OFFERING ON A MEMBERSHIP BASIS. IF THE CAR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED A METAFICTIONAL SIMPLY REPLACE IT ALL THIS IS NOT SOMETHING A CAR DEALERS DO. LASTLY THE OPPOSITION MAY ARGUE TODAY THAT THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FRAMEWORK OF THE BILL. IF YOU DO THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER ASKING THEM IF THEY WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN WHETHER THEY BE INCLUDED WOULD IN FACT REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION- THEIR ANSWERS WILL BE ELIMINATING WE ACTUALLY HAD A VERY ROBUST. YOUR POSITIVE CONVERSATION WITH THEM. THE OTHER DAY I WAS ON THE CALL AS WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. AND YOU KNOW WHAT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO ENGAGE. IN NEGOTIATIONS HAVE NOT PROVIDED US WITH AMENDMENTS- BUT YOU KNOW- HAVE VERY HAPPY. I KNOW THE AUTHORS VERY HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN IT WITH THAT CONVERSATION IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S MEANINGFUL TO THEM. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT OUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE PURCHASES ARE IN DECLINE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS IN FOR SERIOUS ABOUT MEETING OUR CLINICAL AS WE HAVE TO INNOVATE. AND WITH THE PROPER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE WE MUST PROVIDE. NEW PATHWAYS TO INCENTIVIZE EVEY ADOPTION. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES BOTH OF WHOM ARE TESTIFYING BY PHONE. ENTER LOST IN FROM CANOEING AND ROSE MARIE STAND AS THE PRESIDENT OF CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. THANK YOU- SENATOR ALLEN- WE WILL NOW MOVE TO THOSE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND YOU LISTED YOUR- TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES ON THE PHONE. AND WILL STAND FROM CANOE AND ROSE MERRY SHANNON. FROM CONSUMERS FOR AUTO AUTO RELIABILITY. AND WE'LL START WITH MR WILL STAND- MISTER WILL STATE ARE YOU WITH US. I AM OKAY YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BELL AND THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND THE THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING THE TIME TO PRESENT TO DISCUSS THIS BILL. CAN YOU ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANUFACTURER BASED IN TORRANCE WITH THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. ROUTE TO BE A SPONSOR AB THREE TO SIX BECAUSE WE VIEW IT AS A CRITICAL. STEP IN MEETING CALIFORNIA-DRIVERS-PAY-UNDERFUNDED-STATE-PATROL-PENSION THE COMPUTER SO MANY HEALTH. AND NOW. NOT HAVING THE CALIFORNIA EVEY INCENTIVES AVAILABLE CREDIT EVEY CELLS EVEN HARDER THE- FUTURE. THIS BILL GIVES EVEN INDUSTRY AND ALL TURN MODEL TO GET MORE TV'S PRODUCE GET MORE CUSTOMERS NDTV'S. AND MOST PRESSING GIVEN THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WE'RE EXPERIENCING KEEP MORE OF THE ESTIMATED. SEVENTY FIVE ELECTRIC VEHICLE AFFILIATED INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES WORKING IN CALIFORNIA. WE LOOK AT THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPING CALIFORNIA FOR AUTO OFFERINGS AND OUR MEMBERSHIP MODEL WOULD FIT ENOUGH BRING THE ANSWER UNCLEAR. FROM SOME OF THIS OFFER WAS ALREADY PASTA UNDER. LAWS IT'S A GREAT SO WE FACE TWO OPTIONS ONE. AS FORD AND UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT FOR THE COMPANY CONSUMERS AND RISK HAVING TO BE BACK HERE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LIKE MANY OTHERS IN THE PAST AND HAVE TO BE HERE ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS. OR TWO WE COULD'VE BEEN PRO ACTIVE WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE KEY GROUPS THAT HAVE COME UNDER SUPPORT THIS BILL. CREATE A CLEAR CONSUMER FRIENDLY FRAMEWORK GIVES A CLEAR PATH TO PRODUCING MORE TV'S AND GETTING THEM. AND THE CALIFORNIA. WELCOME NINETEEN IS BROUGHT INTO THE ON ECONOMIC DEVASTATION THE CALIFORNIA THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY STILL REMAINS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. SO THE ECONOMIC SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT IS NOT AVAILABLE WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB THREE TO SIX THE REVENUE NEUTRAL BILL I CAN HELP CALIFORNIA GET CLOSER TO ITS CRITICAL EVEY TARGET. MANNER THAT IS MORE CONSUMER FRIENDLY THAN ANY OTHER COMPARABLE FOR. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER WILLSTAND ON ROSE MERRY SHOT HAN- IT'S JUST LET'S HEAR FROM YOU THANK YOU. THE CHAIRMAN FALLON AND MEMBERS I'M ROSEMARY SHEA HAND PRESIDENT CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY OR CARS CARS IS AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT AUTO SAFETY AND CONSUMER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WE HAVE SPONSORED NUMEROUS CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS ENACTED IN CALIFORNIA. AND WASHINGTON DC TO IMPROVE PROTECTIONS FOR NEW AND USED CAR BUYERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB THREE TO SIX. NOW WHEN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS OR HAD THEIR INCOMES DRASTICALLY REDUCED AND MILLIONS MORE FACE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR ECONOMIC FUTURES CONSUMERS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY WARY OF ENTERING INTO LONG TERM LEASES WHICH OP AT HIS HEART OR LUNG. WHICH MAY LAST FOR A YEAR. THERE OFFERS IN. LOWER RISK ALTERNATIVE FREE CONSUME WHO WE TO GIVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES TRY. FROM HAVING TO ENTER A LONG TERM FINANCIAL COMMITMENT PARTICULARLY DURING A PANDEMIC TO COOK FROM THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THE STRONGEST CONSUMER PROTECTION IS INHERENT IN THE MODEL ITSELF WHICH IS THE RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE OR NOT MORE THAN TWO MONTHS TO DISCONTINUE THE MEMBERSHIP. WITH THE MOST RECENT IN BAD NOTICE PERIOD IF THE ARE ADOPTED IN THIS COMMITTEE- WILL BE SHORTENED EVEN FURTHER TO FORTY FIVE DAYS. CURRENTLY THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE VEHICLE REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA'S OVER ELEVEN YEARS. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE WRITING IN VEHICLES WITH OUTMODED SAFETY FATURESTHAT OFFER FAR LESS PROTECTION THE NEWER VEHICLES WITH MORE ADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES THAT'S PARTICULARLY FOR PARTLY DUE TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN. NEGATIVE EQUITY CAUSED BY LONG TERM LOANS IT MUST BE REPAID EVEN AFTER THE CAR'S SCRAPPED OR TRADED IN. AB THREE TO SIX OFFERS A NEW OPTION FOR CONSUMERS THAT WILL HELP ACCELERATE THE REPLACEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S AGING VEHICLE FLEET WITH NEWER SAFER CLEANER VEHICLES. NEWER VEHICLES WITH MORE ADVANCED SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE RISK OF DEATH AND INJURY. FINALLY AB THREE TO SIX WILL ALSO HELP IMPROVE COMPLIANCE WITH AUTO SAFETY RECALLS DUE TO SERIOUS DEFECTS UNFORTUNATELY MANY DEALERS PERSISTENT SELLING DANGEROUS RECALL USED VEHICLES IN OUR STATE WITHOUT OBTAINING THE FREE REPAIRS VERSUS. IN CONTRAST AB THREE TO SIX REQUIRES ELECTRIC. MOBILITY MANUFACTURERS TO ENSURE THAT SAFETY RECALLS TO PERFORM BEFORE RENEWING MEMBERSHIP. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU MRS JOHN AND NOW LET'S TURN TO OUR OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DAN LAST TIME THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT MERIDIAN RADIAN ELECTRIC TRUCK COMPANY EMPLOYING HUNDREDS IN CALIFORNIA AND THOUSANDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE SUPPORT IT THREE TWENTY SIX AS AMENDED BECAUSE WE THINK IT IS A CREATIVE WAY TO HELP EXPAND ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION IN CALIFORNIA. TO HELP THE STATE REACHES CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND POLLUTION REDUCTION GOALS THANK YOU. AND THAT THIS OF THE TERM THAT WAS OUR LAST. THANK YOU. OKAY ONE LAST CALL KERN MODERATE COULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THE LINE AGAIN ONCE AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORT WITNESSES ON AB THREE TO SIX. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OF AB TWENTY SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE TO SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO NOW. IN AT THIS TIME OF THE GERMAN WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. THANK MODERATOR AND NOT HAVING HEARD FROM ALL THE SUPPORTERS. WE WILL NOW FALLTHE SAME PROCESS. AND HEAR FROM. OPPOSITION TO A. B. THREE TO SIX. LET'S START WITH WITNESS IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THE SENATE GALLERY. AND ERA WE WILL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION NOW. AND. YES SIR THERE FOR YOURSELF AND STATE YOUR POSITION. MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS CLIP COSTA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL BUT STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. OVERALL CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION BELIEVES THIS BILL CREATED. FOR VEHICLE SUBSCRIPTIONS WHICH IS A NECESSARY UNFAIRLY COMPETES AGAINST EXISTING DEALER LICENSEES AND IS HARMFUL FOR CONSUMERS VEHICLE SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE ARE BEING OFFERED TODAY BY CALIFORNIA'S DEALERS EITHER THROUGH PROGRAMS OFFERED BY AUTOMAKERS DEALERS SUCH AS BOOK BY CADILLAC OR THROUGH APPS LIKE FOR IN CLUTCH. THIS INCLUDES THE EXACT TYPE OF SUBSCRIPTIONS AUTHORIZED BY THIS BILL AND IS CURRENTLY BEING OFFERED BY D. M. V. LICENSED CAR DEALERS. BECAUSE OF THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY AS THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND ANYONE ELSE COULD JUST BE A LICENSED CAR DEALER AND WE FAIL TO SEE BY THE EXISTING CAR DEALER LICENSING LAWS. PARENTS OF CREATING THIS NEW PATH. ADDITIONALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL UNFAIRLY PREVENTS THE ABILITY OF EXISTING DEALERS TO BE INNOVATIVE AS WELL. VEHICLE SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMS ARE STILL EVOLVING IN THE AUTO RETAIL MARKET AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHICH TYPES OF PROGRAMS WILL SUCCEED. BUT THIS BILL CREATES AN UNFAIR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR THIS NEW CATEGORY BY STATUTORILY PROHIBITING YOUR LOCAL NEW CAR DEALER FROM PARTICIPATING IN OR OFFERING THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. ARE DEALERS WANT TO BE PART OF INNOVATIVE NEW APPROACHES TO RETAILING VEHICLES AND THIS pBILL STATUTORILY PROHIBITS. FINALLY WE BELIEVE THIS BILL LACKS THE IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN ACTIVE OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS AGAINST CAR DEALERS. THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS PREVENT CONSUMERS FROM FRAUD GENTLY SIGNING SOMETHING THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND. BEING MISLED BY AN ACCURATE ADVERTISING OR DRIVING A VEHICLE HICH MAY BE FLOODED SALVAGED OR TOTAL LOSS WITHOUT BEING DISCLOSED. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO WE- DRAW. OR USE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU KNOW BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE SENATE GALLERY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. AT ONE MORE. YES SIR PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF THANK. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION WE ARE THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE MANUFACTURERS OF NINE POINT 9% OF THE VEHICLES ON AMERICA'S ROADS TODAY WE SUPPORTING HE SINGS AB SALES WHICH SUPPORT SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMS WE ARE OPPOSED AB THREE TWENTY SIX FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. FOR BUILD IT. AT THAT LATE TO COMPANIES TO THE EXPRESS EXCLUSION OF ALL OF MY MEMBER COMPANIES WHO INCIDENTALLY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES OUT ON CALIFORNIA'S ROADS TODAY. SENATOR ALLEN RAISE THE QUESTION IF IT DID INCLUDE US WHAT WE SUPPORT NO. BECAUSE THE BILL IS NOT NECESSARY SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMS ARE NOT NOVEL THEY ARE NOT UNIQUE AND THEY ARE NOT PROHIBITED BY EXISTING LAW. IT IS NOT THE TIME TO GO AND CODIFY ONE BUSINESS MODEL TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHERS MANY OF MY MEMBER COMPANIES ARE OFFERING SUBSCRIPTION PILOT PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING AND OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE SHOULD NOT BE MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD AT THE BEHEST OF A HANDFUL OF COMPANIES WITHOUT THE INPUT WHO HAVE YET TO MANUFACTURE VEHICLE. AND EXCLUDING THE INPUT. OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURING AND SELLING VEHICLES FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. SENATOR ALLEN NOTED IN NUMBER OF RATIONALES FOR MOVING THE BILL FORWARD TODAY VEHICLE OF A AVAILABILITY PRICING IN SOME PLACES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT STATE. FEDERAL AND LOCAL INCENTIVES YOU CAN GET INTO A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FOR ZERO DOLLARS. THE CHALLENGE WITH GETTING SAYS OUT ON THE ROAD TODAY IS NOT VEHICLE AVAILABILITY. IT IS CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING. THIS BILL. IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND CODIFY A BUSINESS MODEL THAT DOESN'T NEED TO HAPPEN AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T NEED TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN. LOOKING AT HOW TO MAKE THESE WORK FOR CONSUMERS FOR THE LAST DECADE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE INPUT.

SIR WHY KOWSKI HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE MANAGER OF THE BILL THEY- EXPRESS ENTHUSIASM BY THE AUTHOR IN THE MANAGER TO RIGHT THE SHIP- IF THE CONCERN FOR THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET ACCESS TO CONSUMERS I WAS EVEN. MODEL THAT WE HAVE THAT THEIR DATA AVAILABLE AND I SEE THAT THIS IS NOT THE BILL THIS IS THE BILL SAYS IT'S ONLY THESE MANUFACTURES IT ONLY MAKE ELECTRIC VEHICLES BUT IF THE ENVIRONMENT THE GOAL WAS JUST. EVERY E. V. THAT EXIST CALIFORNIA TO GET IT OUT ON THE ROAD AND HAVE THIS. WHY WOULD YOU NOT INCLUDE. A BROADER SPECTRUM OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME. MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM THAT INCLUDED ALL TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF RIGHT. YEAH IT'S A THROUGH THE CHAIR- CENTERONE OKAY SO FIRST OF ALL AND THIS BILL. HI A NASTY FORM WAS IN PRINT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND I THINK WE WERE WE'RE VERY INTERESTED AT LEAST I KNOW THAT I KNOW I CAN SPEAK FOR BOTH MYSELF AND FOR THE A STUNNER RCG WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN ENGAGING. THE FOR THE FOR THIS AND TO TALK ABOUT THEM IT'S A AND I THINK THE REAL OPENNESS TO INCLUDE. THEM I THINK THAT DAY. HAVE BEEN SO OF TO THE GENERAL IDEA. THAT WOULD OPEN UP FOR THIS THIS TYPE OF OWNERSHIP. THAT THEY JUST I'M WILLING TO ENGAGE US IN INCOME SESSIONS ABOUT AMENDMENTS I THINK I MISSED YOUR QUESTION IS COULD. I AM VERY QUESTION OF THE OPPOSITION ON A CALL THIS YESTERDAY. IN THE TO DECIDE THEY REALLY WANT TO. KILL THE AS OPPOSED GAUGE AND CON. OF HOW TO. THEIR PRODUCTS IN. THIS IN THIS MECHANISM SO. I THINK MAYBE WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO IS THE BILL MOVES FLORIDA JUST UNILATERALLY COME UP. I WAITED YOU JUST WHICH IS WHAT YOU DESCRIBED. I THINK WE WERE HOPING THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO CONJUNCTION WITH. THE ISLANDS WITH THE OPPONENTS WHO WHO MAKE OURS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. HI SO THAT'S IT ALLEN'S AND- BUT I AGREE WITH YOUR PREMISE AND I DON'T THINK THAT- THAT- TAT THE SUMMER CITY DISAGREES EITHER I THINK I THINK THERE'S A- A REAL INTERESTING TRYING TO BE. THIS A MECHANISM. TO ALLOW MORE YOUNG PEOPLE AND PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT STRIDES TO GAIN GREATER. ACCOMMODATION WITH THESE TYPES OF CARS AND THIS IS THE THIS IS A LOW KEY SAFE LOWER COST WAY OF GETTING THESE CARS INTO MORE PEOPLE'S HANDS AND MAKE THEM FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH- WITH YOU WITH THE FEES. AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE GOLF SO LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON ON ON HOW TO DO THAT- EVEN IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO. HI ENGAGE IN A IN A REAL. CONVERSATION WITH THE OPPOSITION AND IN THIS MONTH. MISTER CHAIR IRAQ OUSTED I WOULDN'T CONSIDER MYSELF A JOINER I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MEMBERSHIP- OR JUST DON'T SEE TO THE JOINT MEMBERSHIPS BUT I THINK THAT THIS MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF. SOME OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND THIS IS THE BUSINESS OF THE A ONE OF THE EARLY- BILLS ARE COMING BEFORE US AND FORTUNATELY MISTER CHAIR. I BELIEVE THIS MAY BE YOUR LAST HEARING THAT YOU'RE HAVING A SENATE TRANSPORTATION- COMMITTEE- BUT- I'M- WITH THE MOMENT SIR GIVING I THINK I'M IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THIS- THIS MODEL AND I'M I VIEWED IN ITS EMBRYONIC STAGE IN MAYBE THEY'LL BE OTHER. OTHER DISCUSSIONS COMING FORWARD ON ALL TYPES OF MEMBERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I DO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHICH IS STATED THAT ARE MY CONCERN WELL AS HIS IS THE BROADER OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE PEOPLE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED MORE ELECTRIC FIELD. THAT THE CHARTER. TWENTY TO BE INNOVATIVE THAT. WHICH IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS WORKS- I KNOW THAT CENTER STATED THAT THIS IS BEEN IN FRANCE SINCE EARLY THIS YEAR BUT TO BE FAIR WE HAVEN'T BEEN HERE ALL YOUR PACK AND I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION. BEFORE I DID ANY EVENT YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK AND I KNOW THAT IT WAS JUST GUIDED IN AMENDED THE ASSEMBLY TWO WEEKS AGO. AND WHAT I BELIEVE IS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT BUT IT ALSO NEEDS. TO BRING. POLICY AND THERE AND I CONSIDER TO BE ONE OF THOSE STAKEHOLDERS AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF WE% HAD. AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ALL RIGHT NOW I'M STRUGGLING TO EVEN UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUBSCRIPTION MODEL VERSUS THE LEASE MODEL WHY DO SOME DEALERS HAVE AT Y. EIGHT. OTHERS AND- I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW ALL THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE COME TO DO THAT. WHY NOT AT. ALL OTHER ARM CAR DEALERSHIPS. SOMETHING I REALLY- IMPORTANT THAT I BELIEVE THE PRESENTER BUT RIGHT NOW IS THAT. DISCOVER NINETY. FORTY IN JOB. IT'S AN- I WOULD. THE I. SAID NOT. YES PEOPLE WHO THEIR JOB THIS IS A PART BUT IN A STATE THAT I HAVE. HER FAMILY FUNCTIONS ON CAR DEALERSHIP AND TAX REVENUE. WHEN I ARMS LIKE MY THAT HAVE PART. AND I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AND IS WHAT IS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ARE MY CAR DEALERSHIPS CLINT POINT TO GO OUT OF. AND I'M NOT IMPLYING ARE BUT THAT JUST. BIGGER QUESTION SHOULD WE HAVE MORE TIME TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. AND ALSO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS MOVING THIS DIRECTION I'D GET INFORMATIONAL HEARING WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WOULD ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO. JOIN AND PARKS PAGE UNDERSTAND. RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S SAD TO PREMATURE FOR ME TO TRY AND SUPPORT. ONLY BECAUSE I KNOW I'VE HAD CALLS THE LAST FOUR DAYS FROM ALL THE CAR DEALERSHIPS IN MY AND MY DISTRICT AND AT THE VERY LEAST I HAVE TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT I DEBT AT THE ISSUE I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHY VOTER FURNISHING RIGHT NOW. I JUST SAW THE ANALYSIS I THINK FOUR DAYS AGO AND IT'S ENOUGH TIME FOR ME TO ENGAGE IN OR PAGE. THE R. TO BE FAIR I HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY OTHER. OR SET POINT. THIS WITH PEOPLE PARTICIPATING ALL OF US TRULY ARE. WHAT THE AND IS GOING TO BE SO THIS POINT I GOING TO HAVE TO. OUR STAFF AND SEE IF I CAN GET MORE AND- THANK YOU. OKAY BELIEVE CENTER. TANNER OF WOULD LIKE TO A- SERVICE AND- CENTER DODD AND SENATOR BATES OKAY. SO CENTER SKINNER. YES SENATOR SKINNER HERE- A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR SENATOR ALLEN YOU REFERENCED THE AND THAT IN YOUR PRESENTATION. THAT THERE WAS. THE OFFER AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE AUTHOR CHIU INCLUDE CAR DEALERSHIPS IN THIS MODEL IS THAT CORRECT AND THEY CHOSE NOT TO BE. YES THAT THAT IS CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT THE DIGIT. BROADLY SPEAKING YES THAT'S CORRECT. IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY HAVE A COMPARABLE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE AVAILABLE NOW TO CAR DEALERSHIPS IT'S SO IT'S THEIR SIMILARITIES BUT IT'S DIFFERENT THE WHAT WHAT SO THEY HAVE SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO THAT THAT'S WHERE ONE CAR IS SHARED BY MANY LIKE ZIPCARS FOR EXAMPLE WHERE IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM WHERE YOU ACTUALLY TAKE. YOU KNOW A CAR HOME YOU KNOW HOME LINE OWNERSHIP AND SO THE IDEA IS YOU KEEP THE CAR UNLESS OR UNTIL IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR THE MEMBERSHIP ENDS AND SO THAT'S A MONTH TO MONTH SYSTEM BY THE WAY THEY'RE ALL PAYING TAXES NOT THEM HE'S GOING TO DELIVER GOVERNMENTS AND- I DID. NECESSARILY TO GIVE MORE TO FLESH OUT THE MODEL MORE IF YOU LIKE SENATOR. WELL I'VE READ THE MODEL. THE I BELIEVE THE NOT BELIEVE DâN NOW ASSIST DESCRIBES THE MODEL QUITE WELL. JACK I WANT TO SHAKE- COMMITTEE STAFF FOR A REALLY EXCELLENT ANALYSIS WHICH DOES GIVE US A GOOD AMOUNT OF DETAIL ON THE MODEL- I THINK THE CLARIFICATION I ASK IS THAT. THE OPPOSITION. RAISED THAT. THAT THIS WAS NOT NECESSARY AND I FEEL THAT IT. IT DOES NOT UNFAIRLY COMPETE WITH OUR CAR DEALERSHIPS BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF THEY CHOOSE AND CERTAINLY COULD THAT IF THE ARM IF ART THING STATUTES IN ANY WAY RESTRICT THEY CHOSE NOT TO BE PART OF THIS WE CAN ADDRESS THAT. I AM IN A SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT I MEAN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT CAR SHARE AND THAT WHEN I IN MY FORMER PRIOR BEING LEGISLATURE AND I RAN IT ORGANIZATION THAT RAN THE PROGRAM CITIES FOR CLIMATE PROTECTION WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO. LOCAL FOR INNOVATIVE PROJECTS TO BRING DOWN TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. IN THE EARLY NINETIES WE PROVIDED THE VERY FIRST FUNDING TO THE FIRST TWO CITIES THAT EVER GET HARSHER PROGRAMS WHICH WERE SANTA MONICA IN PORTLAND. THIS AGAIN WAS IN THE EARLY NINETIES. THEY WERE UNABLE TO EXPAND THEIR PARSER PROGRAMS. LET JUST US STATUTES IN ALMOST EVERY STATE PROHIBITED PARK HERE IN TOOK YEARS TO FIX THE STATUTES. AND YET WE NOW APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND THE VERY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR OUR SHARE YOU AT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WISH TO ONLY FAR NOW IN THIS CASE WE HAVE AS CALIFORNIA. AND VICIOUS SCHOOLS. TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS REDUCTION AND FOR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. AND YET WE KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE MANY OF US WE BUY A NEW CAR INFREQUENTLY. AND SO TO TAKE THE TO MAKE THE LEAP OF FAITH TO BUY A VERY NEW TECHNOLOGY. IS OUR IS DIFFICULT FOR MANY PEOPLE AND SO DO YOU. TO BE ABLE TO GET CONCORD USING A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR TWO MONTHS THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS BEFORE WHEN. YEAH THINK IS A REALLY GOOD SERVICE THAT PROVIDES AN WOULD HELP US. ON CALIFORNIA'S NOWHERE NEAR EATING ITS GOALS OF. ARTS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THAT WERE ONE OF THE ROADS FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION EMISSION REDUCTION. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE INNOVATIONS THAT. I NEEDED AND I THINK THAT. I DO NOT SEE IT AS THE TYPE OF THREAT THAT OUR CAR DEALERSHIPS CURRENTLY SEE BUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE THE ABILITY AS THE LEGISLATURE. THERE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO ADJUST OUR STATUTES IN THE FUTURE THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER DODD AND THEN SENATOR BASED AT THE LEAST YES MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I BELIEVE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM FREMONT WAS QUOTING. GROUCHO MARX. WERE YOU ANYBODY THAT WOULD HAVE YOU AS A MEMBER YOU WOULD NOT. I JOIN THAT ORGANIZATION BUT NEVER THE LESS. HI ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THAT OF A CENTER SKINNER I THINK THOSE ARE OF YOUR VERY STREET. COMMENTS CAR DEALERS RIGHT NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS JUST A CASE WHERE WE HAVE A COMPETITOR THE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE SOMEBODY ELSE ORDER ORGANIZATION OF COMPETITORS THAT DOESN'T WANT TO SEE NEW INNOVATION LIKE THIS HAPPENED AND GET THEM INTO THE MARKET. SO THEY'VE GOT SO MUCH TIME THEY CAN EITHER GET WITH THE PROGRAM TO GET THE SAME THING OR I THINK WE SHOULD I THINK WE SHOULD THIS TODAY THIS BILL OUT MY SUPPORT. THERE BATES. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF SENATOR RUBIO REGARDING THE MANNER IN WHICH IS COME FORWARD AND- THE PROBLEM OF REALLY HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIG INTO THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES BETWEEN OUR SHIP IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CURRENTLY THAT WOULD AS I WOULD ASSUME IN IT'S JUST A QUESTION PERHAPS A STATEMENT AND A QUESTION NOT UNDERSTANDING OF FLAT FEE FOR BOARD CHOSE TO ELIMINATE IF COME CHEN ENGINE AND GO ALL ELECTRIC VEHICLE THEY WOULD BE KLAY. BE FACTURE WHO COULD HAVE. THERE SHIPS DOWN TO OF VEHICLES IN A VERY SHORT TIME TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH CANOE. WHO ARE HAVE THIS TOOL. YOU KNOW I IN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THERE ARE INNOVATIVE AND I THINK IT'S GREAT IDEA BUT I THINK WE'VE SET UP A SITUATION. OF COMPETING AND A LITTLE THING TEND DEALERSHIPS. ARM THAT'S THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF CONSUMERS WHO CAN AND IS THIS GOING TO BE A CANOE CAR I GIVE FOR BETTER QUESTIONS. WE ARE AM WARNING AT YOU SUBSCRIBE SOMETHING LIKE AND MY IN SHORT TERM. STEVE FACTOR THEIR CAR IN BUYING OR I MIGHT GET A MEMBERSHIP WITH CANOE AND IT'S A CANOE CAR IS THERE. FOR OVER A CHEVY MALL. FIVE I THINK IT IT'S FULL COMP NOW TO HOW THOSE TWO THINGS OPERATE. CONCURRENTLY AN ANTI AND- I GUESS. PARTNERSHIP VANS COMPARED TO THE WAY IT DOES NOW AND I THINK IF WE HAD MORE TIME IN OF THE STAKEHOLDER ARE MEETING FETTY FASHION ALPHA JUST SAID BY SENATOR- RUBIO WE'D UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT BETTER AND PERHAPS IT WOUL BE MORE RECEPTIVE. ON THE PART OF OUR DEALERSHIPS IN OUR EXISTING OUR MANUFACTURE DEALERSHIP RELATIONSHIP. KIND OF A MULTI PHASE STATEMENT IN QUESTION BUT CLARITY ON THAT POINT IS I THINK EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE OF US. DECIDING HOW WE'RE GOING TO VOTE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO OUR- THE WAY WE CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND THE AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURING ON OUR DEALERSHIP SALE A RELATIONSHIP YEAH. YOU KNOW I'VE I THINK. THROUGH THE CHAIR THE GOOD THE GOOD SENATOR CAN APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT PART OF WHAT MAKES. PROCESS DIFFICULT IS I TO A GROUP OF FOLKS TO RUN THE SYSTEM NOW AND THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY CHANGES IN THIS AREA- AND SO I THINK THEY'RE. THEY'RE GENERAL TAKE HIS BAND WOULD LIKE JUST STOP THE BILL RIGHT AS A TO ENGAGE. IN REAL CALM OF HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE MODEL WITH THIS SO THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE I MEAN I GUESS I THINK FROM RTG IN MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO JUST TRY TO UNILATERALLY IMPOSE A MODEL THAT WOULD INCLUDE THEM WITHOUT INCLUDING THEM IN THE DISCUSSION BUT IF THEY WANT TO PURCHASE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THE THEY WANT. THAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS. BUT FOR OUR FROM IN PERSPECTIVES PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS FORCE THEM TO THE TABLE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO INCLUDE THEM INTO THE INTO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL- AND I THAT'S IT THAT'S- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. I THINK CAN INCREASE BECAUSE YOU'VE ALL HAD DIFFICULT BILLS. BILLS THAT IF YOU TRY TO CHANGE PARADIGMS AND YOU NEED TO. FORCE PEOPLE TO THE CONVERSATION AND THAT'S- EFFECTIVELY WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE- WE ARE ABSOLUTELY OPEN. TO TALKING ABOUT A MODEL WHERE MY FORD. COULD SELL IT YOU COULD COULD COULD HAVE MEMBERSHIP. FIVE IDEALLY WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN WITH FORD AND WORKED OUT WITH THEM WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW THEY WOULD FIT INTO THIS MODEL. SO THAT'S MY HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW WITH HIS BILL MOST FOR IT WILL BE ABLE TO GET EVERYBODY AT TO THE TABLE AND HAVE THEM TAKE THIS CONVERSATION SERIOUSLY AND THEN REALLY TALKED ABOUT HOW. TO INCLUDE THEM. OKAY IN MY ON MY OWN TIME I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER SENATOR ALLEN AND PERHAPS- THE ROOT PROBLEM HERE IS A GOOD AN AMOUNT- WE PUT PEOPLE WE'VE TAKEN WHAT IS A TRADITIONAL- IN HOMERIC OF BUSINESS MODEL NOW I GIVE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MODEL AND WE ARE ON. SURE PERIOD OF TIME BUT THE MAN PLEASE OF LEGISLATION WE'RE KIND OF UP IN AND WE'RE SAYING YOU GUYS. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO YOU KNOW COME TO THE TABLE AND YOU'VE GOT A MONTH AND BY THE WAY WE'RE NOT MEETING FOR THREE NIGHTS BECAUSE OF THE IT IS. ETCETERA KIND OF AN UN. CRITICISM THAT THEY HAVEN'T COME TO THE TABLE. IF YOU WANT TO THE TABLE- THERE OUGHT TO BE A STUDY BILL ON HOW WE LOOK AT THE BUSINESS MODEL. OF TRIM IT FROM INFECTION HERE THROUGH THE CANOE PROPOSAL. AND HALF THAT WILL INDIAN. INCORPORATE THE EXISTING MODEL AND GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOLSA. THOSE FOLKS. ARE YOU'RE HEARING FROM SENATOR BE THE LITTLE RESISTANCE TO THE GOD AND- PROCESS WE GO THROUGH UNLESS THERE'S- A SIGNIFICANT. IMMEDIATE. MERCHANT AND- SEE THAT NEEDS THAT EXPOSE. IN BOB DOUBLE I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE TAKEN IF NOT APPRECIATING THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE F. OUR MODEL PROVIDES TO THE CONSUMERS AND CERTAINLY ARE I'LL CALL GOAL FOR YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. JUST ONE. PLEASE OKAY SO THIS IS THIS IS THIS. THE GOVERNMENT ISSUE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CURRENT CRISIS I HAD PROPOSED THIS BILL IT WAS IN FRAME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. THEN YOU KNOW WE WERE ALL BEING TOLD ON LEASE ON THE SENATE SIDE- TO DRAMATICALLY. CUT BACK OUR BILL LOAD AND I DECIDED TO ONE BACK. ON YOU KNOW SO I AND I DID THAT OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE PROCESS. THEN OF COURSE IT SEEMED IT DID THE AMEND SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WERE NOT BEING QUITE AS- COPPER THAT PROCESS. AND CERTAINLY NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE CHAIR AND WITH THE CARD. TO LEAVE IT THIS THIS IDEA BACK ON THE TABLE COULD I THINK IT HAS AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER I REALLY WANT YOU KNOW WHETHER WE ALL WANT TO FORCE THIS DISCUSSION SO WHY THIS. THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE THE GOTTEN AND IT IS NOT AS THOUGH. SHE WAS IN PRINT FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN IN PRINT THROUGH THE FORM OF MY BILL FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. I KNOW OF IT IS COMPLICATED EVERYTHING IT'S COMPLICATED THIS BILLS PROCESS THAT'S ALL VALID. AND CERTAIN YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT AS WELL BUT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS. YEAH I'M GONNA. GET A LOT. THE CASE THANK YOU YEAH THE COUPLING GALGIANI SENATOR HE SENATOR BELL- I APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND I DID MEET WITH THE NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION THIS BILL AND I OUT THERE THEY HAD SUGGESTED SOME AMENDMENTS AND I WAS TOLD THAT. BECAUSE IT'S A NEW BIT MODEST SQUARE SERVICE AT THAT AGE DON'T ASK WHAT IS WORKABLE AND PROVIDE THOSE TALES FOR A SERVICE BUT ALL THAT SENATE INFANCY IS DIFFICULT AT THIS POINT AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO- AND- HE- VEHICLE. I HAVE SOME WHERE WE PRESCRIBE IN STATUTE EXACTLY HOW THE BUSINESS MODEL SHOULD RUN AND WHO THE WINNERS ARE AND WHO THE LOSERS ARE AND THAT'S THAT AND THAT I HAVE WITH THIS BILL IF THERE WAS A BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY THAT WAS HEARD CONSUME. AT A DIFFERENT SO PERHAPS IT WAS. WAS THERE SOMETHING THAT OCCURRED THAT. ROB DID THIS THAT NEEDS A LEGISLATIVE REMEDY. GENERAL YET TO THE CHAIR AND RUSSIAN THE EFFECTIVELY YES AND I CAN TALK TO YOU MORE ABOUT THE DETAILS BAIT BAIT THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORTS TO PREVENT INNOVATION IN THIS SPACE AND I THINK WERE. I THINK THE SPONSORS AND- OUR A AND THE SUPPORTERS THE BILL ARE HOPING. TO PROVOKE. A MORE ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS MODEL. BECAUSE THERE THERE THERE ARE YOU KNOW THE SAME FOLKS ARE OPPOSING THIS BILL HAVE HAVE OF FINDING STE- IN COURT ELSEWHERE. THE EFFORTS FOR SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO CREATE THIS MODEL AND GET THIS MODEL OUT THERE TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMERS. FROM FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS BILL WOULD ESSENTIALLY PROHIBIT THE OTHER CAR DEALERS SOLUTION THE CARD DEALERS FROM HAVING THEIR CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION MODELS THAT IT ACTUALLY NOT THREE THIS IS THIS CREATES A NEW LOW. REMEMBER THE MODEL. THAT THEY CAN PROCEED WITH THIS DOESN'T IT THIS DOESN'T PREVENT THEM FROM THE ALL TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO UNDER THE CURRENT. UNDER CURRENT WORK. SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THEIR SUBSCRIPTION MODELS THAT THEY HAVE CURRENTLY IN PRACTICE THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF YOU BEEN GIVING UP IS THERE SOMETHING THAT. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING I CERTAINLY IF YOU IF YOU THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THE NEED TO BRING MY ATTENTION TO IT I'M NOT SURE OF I'M I'M- YOU KNOW POLICY WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FOR THAT. THAT'S NOT OUR INTENT. OKAY SIR BRIAN. THANK YOU THE CARE I GOT A QUESTION THE AUTHOR THE FLOOR JOCKEY. SO TO I LOOK IN MY SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION I SEE TESLA NOT IN IT THEY ONLY WANT ALLEGE THEY ONLY MAKE. VEHICLES ARE THEY AT THIS TIME WITH THE AND I KNOW THAT THEIR A DEALER- ARE THEY ABLE TO. USE THIS. TECHNOLOGY OR THIS LEGISLATION- AND IF SO- WHY WOULDN'T THE PEOPLE OF CANOE CHIPS. GET OF A LICENSE LIKE THEY HAVE AND MOVE FORWARD YEAH. ADD TO CHAIRED BY THE WAY I GOT CLEARLY FROM THE STATUS NOW ON. SENATE GALGIANI THAT DID ABSOLUTELY THIS THE CURRENTS OF SENATE GALGIANI THE ON THE SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAM THAT ARE. THAT THE OTHER FOLKS ARE ARE TAKING ARE DOING I WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL SO THEY COULD. WE CAN TO PROGRAM IS IT BECAUSE EXISTING PROGRAM. CANCER CENTER DOLLAR SAN. AND IT'S UNDER THAT. THAT RIGHT NOW. THE TEST LIKE THE BILL. THE WITH PROBLEM IS THAT THE DO. WITHOUT THIS BILL THEY- SAID THEY WANTED PURSUE THE- THE MEMBERSHIP MODEL THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE BILL. HAD SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS TO BE PASSED. THANK IS THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. SIR OUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSER HERE NO SPEAK OTHER ICE- SIR WHAT CAO SPEAKS USING CENTER WHITE HOUSE CAN ALL MOVE THE BILL. CAPTION ON THE BILL CENTER I WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE I LOOK I WANNA THINK MY COLLEAGUES AND I WANT TO THINK. OF ALL THIS DISCUSSION FOR THIS ROBUST DEBATE I THINK YOU'VE ALL BROUGHT A- SINGLE ONE OF YOU. PRODUCT CRITICAL ISSUES. WE'LL FIND A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE ONE OR TWO COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE FOLKS IN OPPOSITION. WITH RESPECT ON THE ISSUE OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. AS A RESULT AND THANKS TO THE HELP OF OUR FRIENDS FROM THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS THIS BILL HAS TO THE STRONGEST CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE BUSINESS NOW AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT BILL IN. THEY INVOLVED IN IT SINCE AND AS A RESULT WE'VE NOW ACCEPTED A RAFT OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIS BILL THAT REALLY MAKE IT A STANDARD CARDS CONSUMER ACTION. I TO THEM IN THEIR- MOUNTAINS. I'M THERE IS A REAL IN ON THE PART AYE AYE AYE KNOW THAT I EMPHASIZE IT ENOUGH A REAL INTEREST ON THE PART OF MYSELF AND I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER CG TO ENGAGE THE OPPOSITION AND TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE THIS. I THINK THE DATE GOT. HIGH QUALITY ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT WE WANT TO GET OUT THERE. WE WANT IN THE PART OF THE SOLUTION AS WELL. YOU KNOW THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT OLD MODEL. OF CAR OWNERSHIP WORKS MANY OF US- BUT DOESN'T WORK. EVERYBODY AND CERTAINLY DOESN'T WORK A LOT OF YOUNGER PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING ECONOMICALLY. THIS IS A NEW WAY. TO GET MORE. EVEN OUT. PEOPLE'S I AM. IN GET BEHIND WE'LL GET THEM TRYING THESE DOUBT BUT IT THE WAY THAT FROM THEM WITH MORE FOR. THEY DON'T TO TAKE ON ALL OF THE ALL OF THE RISK OF ALL OF CALLS FOR IN A- WITH A TRUE. I BUT IT REALLY DOES COME THEIR CAR LIKE I SAID. MY WITH THEIR LIVING AROUND CARS AND SHARING THEM. SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THEY THEY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO KNOW THAT THIS IS A CAR THAT IS TAKEN OUT OF THE DEALERSHIP THAT. ON THE DAY. HAVE HAVE HAVE. HELLO SO THIS IS A NEW MODEL THE NO ABOUT THAT ON A NO I JUST THROW OUT THERE ARE INTERESTING TO INCLUDE. DEALERS IN THE CAR TAX IS THAT. HOW WE COME UP MODEL TOGETHER THAT WILL WORK FOR THEM TO WORK FOR THE SPONSORS- AND SO I ASK YOU TO. CONTINUE THAT DISCUSSION I AND YOU KNOW THIS. COULD VERY WELL LIKELY OFF INTO THE FUTURE INCLUDING INTO NEXT YEAR YOU KNOW ANYTHING THAT IS IN THIS BILL THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR THE FOLKS INVOLVED I CAN BE CHANGED AS SKINNER SAID A VERY WELL UNIT BUT THIS THIS IS A WORK QUESTION.
