THAT'S WHY YOU'RE THE BEST CHAIR WELL THANK YOU. EVERYONE'S NOT IN THEIR HEADS TO THE PEOPLE'S. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. YEAH THERE'S A COUPLE ANYONE WHO'S THE CHAIR THERE LIKE A COUPLE WHO WERE A OUR DISAGREEMENTS ARE WELCOME MISS CALM WATER THIS IS ON AB FIVE FIVE THREE PET INSURANCE YES SIR THANK YOU COULD AFTER NOON GOOD MORNING STILL MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PRESENTING AB FIVE FIVE THREE. TO REQUIRE PET INSURANCE POLICIES SOLD IN RENEWED IN CALIFORNIA TO FULLY COVER SPAYING AND NEUTERING OF PETS AND ANY VETERINARY EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SERVICES SO ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY. NATIONAL PET OWNERS SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN PET PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION SIXTY SEVEN. PERCENT OF U. S. HOUSEHOLDS OR ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION FAMILIES OWN A PET. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT NUMBER WENT UP AS A RESULT OF CODED- WITH ALL THE THERAPY PUPS AND KITTIES THAT. WERE ADOPTED THE A. P. P. A. ALSO REPORTS THAT OBTAINED FROM AN ANIMAL SHELTER OR HUMANE SOCIETY BUT- 72% OF DOGS IN 64% OF CATS. ARE OBTAINED THROUGH FRIENDS RELATIVES BREEDERS STRAY OR PRIVATE PARTY. CALIFORNIA FUNDS TO PROGRAMS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S PREVENTION FUND PROGRAM AND THE PET LOVERS LICENSE PLATE PROGRAM TO BE USED TO PROVIDE LOW COST OR FREE SPAY NEUTER SERVICES FOR DOGS AND CATS OWNED BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. THESE DOLLARS ACTUALLY GO TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO OFFSET THE COSTS OF SPAYING AND NEUTERING PETS. AND WE KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- STRAY ANIMALS OFTEN OR NON WANTED ANIMALS OFTEN END UP EUTHANIZED WHICH IS ALSO AN INCREDIBLE COST TO CITIES AND COUNTIES. IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS EACH YEAR APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION SHELTER ANIMALS ARE EUTHANIZED. THE OVERPOPULATION OF UNWANTED AND SURRENDERED PETS NOT ONLY RESULTS IN MILLIONS OF ANIMALS BEING EUTHANIZED EACH YEAR BUT PUTS PRESSURE ON THELIMITED RESOURCES PUBLIC RESOURCES. TO CARE FOR AND FIND HOMES FOR THESE ANIMALS. THE SHEER SCALE OF TACKLING PET OVERPOPULATION CAN APPEAR OVERWHELMING BUT THERE ARE SMALL STEPS. TO PROTECT THIS UNNECESSARY SUFFERING WE KNOW THAT STATES HAVE RESPONDED BY ADOPTING LAWS THAT MAKE IT MANDATORY FOR RELEASING AGENCIES TO HAVE. DOGS AND CATS SPAYED OR NEUTERED. THE MAJORITY OF THESE LAWS ARE DIRECTED AT NEW OWNERS. ADOPTING PETS FROM POUNDS SHELTERS OR LOCAL HUMANE SOCIETIES AB FIVE FIVE THREE WOULD REQUIRE PET INSURANCE COMPANIES TO JOIN THE COMBINED EFFORTS. OF SHELTERS ANIMAL OWNERS BREEDERS AND VETERINARIANS TO TACKLE THE OVER POPULATIONS BY REQUIRING THE POLICIES TO FULLY COVER SPAYED AND NEUTERED. AND ASSOCIATIVE VETERINARY EXPENSES THIS EFFORT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE RECENT SURGE OF ANIMAL ADOPTIONS WILL NOT FURTHER EXACERBATE ANIMAL. OVERPOPULATION AND PET HOMELESSNESS HELLO IN OUR STATE. WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF MICHAEL MARTINEZ WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND SUSAN TAYLOR WITH ACTORS AND OTHERS FOR ANIMALS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU- THIS IS THE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SUPPORT WITNESSES TO JOIN THE HEARING MISTER MARTINEZ ARE YOU. ARE YOU THERE YES SIR I AM HERE GO AHEAD SIR THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SURE DAILY GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MICHAEL MARTINEZ HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. COMMISSIONER LOT IS VERY PROUD TO BE THE SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE AND WE THANK SENATOR COM LONGER FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS MEASURE. SO ME JUST JUMP RIGHT TO THREE MAIN REASONS WHY WE ARE PURSUING AB FIVE FIVE THREE THIS YEAR. FIRSTLY THIS BILL IS PART OF THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING COMMITMENT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ANIMALS IN OUR SHELTERS AS OUR STATE AGGRESSIVELY WORKS TOWARDS BECOMING A NO KILL STATE. DURING THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN A SKYROCKET OF PET ADOPTIONS FROM NOT JUST SHELTERS BUT ALSO PET BREEDERS AN ONLINE PET SALES. I THANK YOU ALL THAT WE CAN SO THESE CAN DEMOCRATS DO NOT ADD MORE TO THE ALREADY STAGGERING ANIMAL OVER POPULATION IN OUR STATE. AND THE ONLY SURE WAY TO DO THIS IS THROUGH STERILIZATION. SECONDLY THIS BILL HELPS PROMOTE NECESSARY ACCESS TO CARE. FOR THE SPANIARD OR SERVICES. TODAY ONLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE POLICIES COVER SPAY AND NEUTER SURGERIES. MEANWHILE FOR MANY OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE PET INSURANCE POLICIES THAT DON'T COVER NEUTER AND SPAY SERVICES THE INSURANCE COMPANY DOES ONE OF TWO THINGS IT CAN IT CAN MANDATE THAT PET OWNERS CHAPTER COVERED PET SPAYED OR NEUTERED ON THEIR OWN. FORETASTE CERTAIN COVERAGE EXCLUSIONS. OR IT MAKES THE PET OWNER PURCHASED ADDITIONAL ADD ON BONUS PLANS IN ORDER TO COVER EXPAND YOUR SERVICE BUT- WE BELIEVE IT'S UNFAIR TO CONSUMERS BUT A LOT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. PROVIDE LITTLE TO NO COVERAGE FOR STERILIZATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME. EXCLUDE COVERAGE FOR ILLNESSES CAUSED BY NON STERILIZATION. THIRDLY ALTHOUGH THE BILL COULD IMPOSE A SMALL PREMIUM COSTS AND POLICY HOLDERS TO COVER A ONE TIME PROCEDURE. WE BELIEVE IT'S A SMALL CONSTIPATED PREVENT FUTURE PET HEALTH PROBLEMS DECREASE COSTS CLEAR THAT FOR THE- LAST UNNECESSARY EUTHANASIA. OF LIVING ANIMALS AND ULTIMATELY IN THE LONG RUN REDUCE INSURED LOSSES TO. IN CLOSING WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF ANIMAL OVERPOPULATION EVERY ANGLE WE CAN'T. LOCAL SHELTERS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE STERILIZATION SERVICES CANNOT MEET THIS DEMAND ALONE ESPECIALLY WHEN SOME SHELTERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO PERMANENTLY CLOSED BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS. YOU TO THE PANDEMIC OR DO NOT HAVE ANY APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF THE OVERWHELMING DEMAND FOR THE SERVICES. THE FIFTEEN SEVEN I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR ITEMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MARTINEZ AND- MISS TAYLOR ARE YOU THERE. YES I AM PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME IS SUSAN TAYLOR AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ACTORS AND OTHERS FOR ANIMAL IT pBECAUSE THERE ARE MORE SERVICES AND LAWS THAT REQUIRE SPAY NEUTER THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THAT WE CAN LOWER OUR GUARD. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SAY THEY ARE NOT A DRIVER FOR OVER POPULATION NO ONE HAS SAID THEY WERE BUT NO ONE CAN SAY HOW MANY OF THEIR CLIENTS REMAIN ON STERILIZED AND WE PRODUCE. STATISTICS USED FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION WE PHOTO ANIMALS IN SHELTERS NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY ANIMALS ARE IN THE HOMES ARE ON THE STREETS WE PRODUCING IT FIFTY YEARS LATER AS ONE AS ONLY ONE ORGANIZATION WE ARE STILL GOING STRONG THE PROBLEM IS STILL WITH US. WE AGO IN THE MISSION OF SPAY NEUTER AND HAVE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL PROCEDURES WE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION BUT BECAUSE WE PROVIDE SPAY NEUTER HELP AND THEN DEAL WITH DISTRAUGHT PET GUARDIANS WHEN THEY'RE ON STERILIZED PETS BECOME SERIOUSLY ILL WITH LIFE THREATENING AND EXPENSE OF HEALTH PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON WE SEE IS FILE ME TRACK WITH A URINE'S INFECTION THAT IS TOTALLY AVOIDED BY STAYING IT IS OFTEN UNRECOGNIZED AND CAN BE FATAL. LAST YEAR WE HELPED WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MEDICAL PROCEDURES FIFTY ONE OF WHICH WERE FOR BY A MAJOR OR MAMMARY TUMORS THAT IS 10% IT IS UNFAIR FOR TO CONSUMERS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES PROVIDE LITTLE TO NO COVERAGE FOR STERILIZATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME EXCLUDE% COVERAGE FOR ILLNESSES CAUSED BY NON STERILIZATION. STAINER IS THE ONLY SURE WAY TO STOP WE PRODUCTION AND PROVIDES IMPORTANT HEALTH BENEFITS IT ALSO HELPS WITH STOPPING PENSION AID FROM ROAMING AND POSSIBLY GETTING HIT BY CAR. PESTERS THEIR LIVES ONLY ONCE SO ONLY ONE PLANE AND AT FIFTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION ESTIMATES THAT MOST OF THEIR CLIENTS ALREADY OR SPAY NEUTER BEEN ACOSTA WILL ARE MARGINAL DURING THIS PAST YEAR WE HAVE ALL FACE SOCIAL ISOLATION AND TURNED TO OUR PETS FOR COMPANIONSHIP. AND HELP IN REDUCING AND SIGN THE END OF PRESSURE. THEY ARE PART OF OUR- WE SHOULD TREAT THEM AS- I RESPECTFULLY WE- A YES VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MISS TAYLOR- ARE THERE ANY PERSON SIR ON THE PHONE IN LINE- WHO WOULD LIKE. TO SPEAK TO US IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. IF YOU'D LIKE TO STATE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AB FIVE FIVE THREE YOU PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR PHONE. AGAIN THAT'S ONE AND THEN ZERO. WE HAVE SEVERAL IN Q. MOBILE FIRST ONLINE TWENTY EIGHT TO EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BURKE THIS IS JENNIFER APPEARING HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE FIVE THREE ON IN BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA CLEAR DRY THOUGH. THANK YOU. THINGS ONLINE TWENTY SEVEN TWO SEVEN. BUXAR MISTER CHAIR TWENTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. YES HI MY NAME IS NICOLAS JACQUET DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS OR SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE HAVE ONE OTHER LINE THIS LINE TWENTY NINE TO NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SHARING INVOLVEMENT WITH THE RUNNING PUBLIC POLICY GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE CITY IN THE BILL OF. THE CAP OR TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS SUPPORT EACH. THANK YOU. AND I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THAT IS THE- TOTALITY OF THE. FOLK SINCE WE DO HAVE A- A LATE ARRIVAL IF YOU HAVE JUST A MOMENT STRUCTURE. SLY NUMBER THIRTY TWO THREE TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS JOE CONTENT FROM PUBLIC COUNCIL IN LOS ANGELES WE'RE CALLING TO- EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. AND I. THAT CONCLUDES THE. SUPPORT WITNESSES SANDRA COLLINS AND WE'LL GO NOW TO THE OPPOSE WITNESSES- THERE ARE TWO THAT I'VE BEEN INFORMED OF- CHRIS ROSA ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH AMERICAN PET HEALTH INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. AND INDIANA LOOK pTOWARD YOUR KEEN PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA- MISS ROSE ARE YOU THERE. I'M HERE NEXT YEAR GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. CRITTERS ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH AMERICAN PET HEALTH INSURANCE ASSOCIATION WHOSE MEMBERS MAKE UP 99% OF THE PET HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS IN THAT STATE. FIRST OF ALL- IF YOU PORTANTINO'S THAT NAPPY MEMBERS SHARE SENATOR CALL MARGARET BOTH IN CREATING PET THERE WAS A XIN RATE IN CALIFORNIA. BEIJING HAS YOU KNOW PLEASE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PET HEALTH AND REDUCE THE- OF PET OVERPOPULATION. HOWEVER WHERE WE DISAGREE IS ON THE SOLUTION- THE COMMISSION PROPOSED BY THE- AND- MANDATE ON ALL PET INSURANCE PRODUCTS CANNOT ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST OFF. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HOMEWORK PACKET OVER POPULATION WE MUST FOCUS ON THE POPULATION OF ANIMALS DRIVING NOT PROBLEM. THE BILL STACK SHEETS CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED POPULATION OF AT THE NEED TO STERILIZATION THE FACT SHE STATE THAT EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING VETERINARY SERVICES FOR STERILIZATION. THIS IS NOT BE INSURED POPULATION PLEASE NOTE THAT ENSURED PAT ARE ALREADY LARGELY STERILIZED BEFORE THEY BECOME INSURED. 87% OF PACKAGE ONE YEARS OF AGE ARE ALREADY STERILIZED AT THE TIME OF THE MOMENT IN NINETY THREE PERCENT. A POPULAR TWO YEARS OLD HAVE ALREADY BEEN STERILIZED AT THE TIME OF THE MOMENT BASED ON THE DATA THIS BILL WOULD FORCE CONSUMERS TO PAY FOR STERILIZATION COVERAGE AND YET THEY CANNOT USE THE STERILIZATION COVERAGE THAT THEY PAY FOR BECAUSE YOU. CANNOT BE STERILIZED TWICE. CONSUMERS ALTHOUGH. NUMBER DO NOT WANT TO BE TO PAY FOR SERVICES THAT THEY CAN USE NOT ONLY ARE YOU FORCED PET PARENTS SHE FOR COVERAGE THEY CAN'T USE YOU ARE NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM OVER TOP OF PETS BECAUSE THE- INJURED PAT ARE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE HOMELESS AND THEIR ALLIES TO POPULATE. UNDER THE CAPOUE BY THE- PREMIUMS WILL UP. AND POTENTIAL CALLED. WILL LOOK AFTER THE- OF WHAT THE MATH PAPER THE PRODUCT AND ONE WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD THEY WANT TO FIND AFTER PET INSURANCE WHEN THEY'RE FORCED TO PAY FOR COVERAGE THEY CANNOT USE. THIS TO THE SECOND PROBLEM WITH THAT SO THERE IS NO NEED TO MANDATE THEIR REALIZATION COVERAGE BECAUSE THEIR REALIZATION COVERAGE ALREADY EXIST IN THE MARKET IF YOU NEED IT AND ONE. THIS IS WHY WORK. KERN IT HAD HEARING HAS THE NEED FOR COVER THEY CAN BE IT MAKING WELLNESS THAT COVERS LIKE STERILE. DENTAL CLEANING ACUPUNCTURE IF A PET PARENT ALREADY STERILIZED PETS ISSUES ACROSS THAT DOESN'T COVER STERILIZATION BECAUSE AGAIN WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU CANNOT USE. OUR WORK WITH POLICY HOLDERS CHAU WHAT THAT THIS IS WHAT PARENTS PREFER. THEY WANT TO CHOI TO PAY FOR WHAT THEY NEED. WE LIKE THE OPTION OF BUYING STERILIZATION IF THEY NEED IT AND BE LIKE NOT HAVING TO PAY FOR IT IF THEIR PET IS ALREADY STERILIZED THIS TYPE OF P. IN REPORT. IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE PET INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THIRD PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IT'S A MATTER OF EQUITY AND PASSING ALONG THE COST OF STERILIZATION FROM PREFAIR ALIVE SHELTER PETS. WHO WOULD BE FORCED TO PAY FOR THE COVERAGE EVEN THOUGH THEY CANNOT USE IT THEMSELVES BECAUSE SHELTER PETS ARE ADOPTED KERALITE HERE'S WHAT I MEAN BY THIS EQUITY ISSUE. CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY REQUIRES ANY PET ADOPTED FROM A SHELTER OR RESCUE TO BE STERILIZED IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW. AT THE OWNER WHO ADOPT A SHELTER PET ISSUES IS TO PURCHASE. HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD BE FORCED TO PAY FOR THE STERILIZATION COVERAGE THEY CANNOT DO AND IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR TO REQUIRE THESE PET PARENTS USED TO SUBSIDIZE. THE COST OF STERILIZATION OF AN EXPENSIVE SURPRISE IT WOULD BOTTOM OF LEADERS WHO THE OWNER CAN CERTAINLY AFFORD THE COST OF THE COMPANY TO GET THEIR PETS SIX. TWENTY THREE REASONS YOU RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR HELP. OUT THANK YOU MISTER. AND THERE'S A RED OF THE PER AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA. YEAH ANALYSTS ARE KEEN ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. RIGHT. REGRETFULLY OPPOSES AB FIVE FIVE THREE AND IT'S ASKING FOR A NO VOTE FROM MEMBERS TODAY- INITIATIVE IS TO INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND UNFORTUNATELY WE THINK THAT THE SELLER COUNTER TO THAT GOAL AND IN ADDITION TO THE REASONS STATED BY NEED YEAH CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL FOR TWO ADDITIONAL REASON- YOU KNOW FIRST ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL TENANTS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IS THAT INSURANCE POLICIES PROVIDE COVERAGE AGAINST LOSSES THAT CANNOT BE ANTICIPATED LIKE A CAR CRASH OR FIRE. I THINK IT INDIAN OUT THAT INSURANCE IS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IT IS THEIR SUPPORT THE ANALYSTS FINANCIALLY AND THEY'RE KIND OF HARM AND THEY CANNOT COVER THAT BUILT SIMILARLY TO IT SIMILARLY IF SOMEONE GETS INTO A CAR CRASH AND NEEDS INSURANCE TO COVER EXPENSES HOWEVER OUR PETS ARE LIKE OUR FAMILIES AND OUR INSURANCE KNOW THAT THAT A WHY INSURERS HAVE CREATED SEPARATE WELLNESS PLAN EITHER MORE LIKE TRADITIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE CHECK OUT BILLY INTAKE AND FEARLESSLY SAM. AND ARE CONVERSELY MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THEIR. HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. I REQUIRED HE AND EXPECT BY SO WITH PET OWNERS. LIKE THERE'LL BE. CAN BE. IT WILL LIKELY TAKE THE FORTY FOR FOLKS WHO NEED SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT ONLY A THE AND FORCING THAT PADDOCK HARM TWENTY THIRD. THREE SECOND NEARLY TEN AFFAIR NEW PER IN THE OF IN FOR. EIGHTEEN ONLY TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTY AND NORTH- ARE COMPANIES WITH MORE PEOPLE TO BUY HEALTH AND ONE WAY THAT WE HOPE TO DO THAT AND BY MAKING IT. AS AFFORDABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR FAMILIES. HOWEVER DISPELLED REQUIRED COVERAGE FOR STERILIZATION REGARDLESS OF WHAT WHETHER A PET OWNER WANTS OR NEEDS THAT COVERAGE. WHEN A MANDATED PLANS ON INSURANCE PREMIUMS HAVE TO RISE TO COVER THAT NEED AND ALTHOUGH AS HE PREVIOUSLY MANY OF OUR PETS ARE AIRLINES. WERE WORRIED THAT. A FIVE THIRTY WHICH IN OUR- SELECTION. WHEREBY FANS OWNERS GOAL COVERAGE. ONLY TO COVER THE COST OF YOUR LOCATION FEATURE AND THEN CANCEL ABOUT COVERAGE OF DRIVING UP PREMIUMS FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS ASKED WE RESPECTFULLY ASK I KNOW THE DAY AND- ALL STAY ON THE LINE WITH CHRISTY ANSWER AND ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OKAY YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S LET'S GO AHEAD AND HEAR FROM ANY OTHER PERSONS WHO- WHO ARE OPPOSING THIS. BILL ARE THERE OTHERS ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY FIVE FIVE THREE ME PRESS ZERO ON YOUR PHONE AGAIN THE COMMANDOS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. WE DO HAVE ONE LINE IN QUEUES TO BE JUST A MOMENT PLEASE. TO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING MR SHARON MEMBERS MY NAME IS DANNY WRITER AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION- A PTA THE NATIONAL TRADE THAT NUMBER GREAT 60% AT THE A PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET AND I WOULD JUST LIKE YOU ECHO THE CONCERNS FROM THE NORTH AMERICAN PET HEALTH INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. AND ASK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NOW ON EIGHTY FIVE FACTORY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHERS- ON THE NO SIDE. NO FOR THE MIND AND Q. GOOD THANK YOU. AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO- THIS HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION- THE MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS THIS TO APPROPRIATIONS- IS THERE A MOTION AND SECOND. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE WHILE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT MAKING A MOTION GO AHEAD SIR. MISTER COOPER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT IS THE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR GOOD TO SEE CENTER BY THE WAY- CURRENTLY- PEOPLE HAVE THE CHOICE TO PURCHASE A POLICY BASED ON THE COVERAGE THEY NEED IF THEIR PETS ARE SPAYED OR NEUTERED WHY WOULD THEY BUY POLICY WITH SPARE NEUTER COVERAGE. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. IT'S SO I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO BE HONEST THIS IS STILL A SMALL POPULATION OF FOLKS THAT ARE EVEN INTERESTED IN PURCHASING PET INSURANCE- V. THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION SORT OF PRESUME THAT THIS IS STATIC WHERE IF YOU'RE A PET OWNER YOU'RE ONLY DEALING WITH ONE PET IN YOUR NEVER GOING TO GET ANOTHER PET- BUT WE ALSO KNOW. THAT WITH OTHER FORMS OF INSURANCE- YOU THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE PART OF THE BASIC COVERAGE- THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SELECT THE TO OPT OUT OF AND THIS IS ELEVATING STERILIZATION TO THAT LEVEL BASED ON TRUTHFULLY THE COMMUNITY IMPACT THAT ON STERILIZED ANIMALS- BECAUSE TO THE COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE IF YOU HAVE A KID PAT THAT'S NOT STERILIZE THAT'S OUT THERE PROCREATING IN OVER POPULATING THAT ACTUALLY COSTS MORE- NOT ONLY TO PET OWNERS pADDITIONAL COSTS- THAT COME FROM THESE AND I WANT TO SAY ROGUE ANIMALS BUT ANIMALS OUT THERE DOING STUFF- IT ALSO ACCELERATES THE COSTA COUNTY IS A BENEFIT THAT CAN CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE TO COVER AS IT RELATES TO DEALING WITH YOUTH AND IDEATION- AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS DEALING WITH STERILIZATION AFTER THE FACT. AND THE- DAMAGE THAT THOSE ANIMALS CAN ALSO COST TO NEIGHBORHOODS COMMUNITIES HOMES NEIGHBORS HOMES ETCETERA. SO IT IS TRUE. THAT YOU MAY HAVE A PET NOW. THAT'S ALREADY BEEN STERILIZED BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF FOLKS I GET INSURANCE THAT MANY OF THEM GET INSURANCE FOR PETS THAT ARE NOT STERILIZED FOLKS THAT ARE GETTING PADS FROM A RELATIVE FROM A FRIEND FROM A BREEDER FROM A STORE. THOSE PETS DON'T AUTOMATICALLY COME TO THEM STERILIZED. AND SO THIS WOULD SAY. IN THIS ACTUALLY ALSO DOESN'T SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR ANIMAL STERILIZED BUT IT DOES SAY THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA CONSIDER GETTING PET INSURANCE THAT THIS IS NOT AN ELECTIVE OPTION. YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION DID MENTION THAT MANY OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T OFFER THIS AND SOME SAY YOU CAN'T HAVE A PET THAT STERILIZED WHEN YOU GET INSURANCE. AND THEIR EXCLUSIONARY CLAUSES THAT ARE PART OF THE INSURANCE POLICY AND THEY SAY THAT BUT IF YOU GET ONE THAT ISN'T ENSURE THAT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU MORE. SO THEY'RE MAKING MONEY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION. WHEN THIS TRIES TO BRING A LITTLE MORE EQUITY AND PARITY- ADD TO THE PET INSURANCE- COVERAGE POLICIES THAT ARE OFFERED. I MEAN YOU IT SAYS I GUESS YOU COULD ALSO TALK ABOUT OTHER KINDS OF ILLNESSES AND AILMENTS THAT ANIMALS HAVE- YOU DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE I WOULD ASSUME WE'RE NOT GETTING INSURANCE THINKING ARE ANTICIPATING A PROCEDURE IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY BUT HOPING THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT IF IT DOES BECOME NECESSARY. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PENSIONS IS NOT CHEAP AT ALL SO IT'S A IT'S A CERTAIN UNIQUE MARKET. AND WITH THOSE FOLKS THE RESPONSIBLE PET OWNERS ALREADY. SO I GUESS AT THE END OF THE DAY- THE POLICY. I GET WITH THE NEW POLICY IS GONNA COST MORE. SINCE THIS BIG INNER COVERAGE MANDATE THAT CORRECT WELL ALL POSTED THE POLITICAL POLICY WILL GO UP NOW WELL I WILL SAY THAT- THE POLICIES. THAT COVER SPAYING AND NEUTERING ARE FOUR TIMES AS EXPENSIVE- AS THE MOST AFFORDABLE POLICIES AND THOSE AFFORDABLE POLICIES RANGE AND- FOR TEN TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH- INCREASE IN PREMIUM COSTS OF RUNNING PREMIUM COST THE COST TO HAVE THE INSURANCE. THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY MISTER COOPER I SEE MR VOEPEL HAS HIS MIKE UP. FOR A QUESTION OR COMMENT. COMMENT MISTER CHAIR PLEASE HOLD ON I'VE ACTUALLY SOLD PET INSURANCE SO I'VE GOT SOME EXPERIENCE MAINLY FOR GROUP AND ASSOCIATION PLANS PEOPLE BUY PET INSURANCE BECAUSE THE PETS ARE THEIR CHILDREN I LOVE THEM AND GENERALLY THE PETS THAT ARE TWO YEARS AND OLDER OR ALREADY SPRAYED AND NEUTERED SO THE AUTHOR DOES HAVE A POINT THAT THE PETS UNDER. TWO YEARS OLD. THIS WOULD COME IN HANDY FOR NOW. ALL RIGHT LAUD A GREATLY RESPECT THE INTENT OF THE BILL BUT THE EXECUTION IS WHAT I TAKE SOME ISSUES WITH. GENERALLY PEOPLE FOR THEIR POLICIES DEPENDING UPON THE SIZE OF THE GROUP FOR THE ASSOCIATION OR OFFERED A COUPLE PLANS ONE WAS BAY- NEUTERING ONE WITHOUT. AND THEY CHOOSE WHICH ONE SUITS THEM THE BEST. GENERALLY AND ONCE AGAIN I'M JUST THIS IS ANECDOTAL. GENERALLY THE PEOPLE THAT PICK. THE POLICIES THAT DON'T INCLUDE SPACE YOU'RE IN THE NEUTERING DO IT THEMSELVES PAY FOR THEMSELVES OF THE GET THE SHELTER ANIMALS ECCENTRIC NOW. THE PREMIUMS I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT FOR MAYBE FIVE SIX YEARS BUT GENERALLY THE COST BETWEEN THE TWO OPTIONS ARE NOT THAT EXPENSIVE BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN IT'S A ONE TIME COST- THE COMPANIES THAT I'VE SEEN FOR FIVE YEARS AGO WOULD ADD ABOUT EIGHTY CENTS TO A DOLLAR TWENTY TWO THE MONTHLY PREMIUM. SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ARE SHAKING MONEY HERE EITHER- I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL SIMPLY% BECAUSE I SUPPORT CONSUMER CHOICE. AND THIS WOULD BE AN- UNFUNDED MANDATE FROM THE STATE WHICH ALWAYS IRRITATES ME ANYWAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR- THANK YOU SIR AND MR CHAN HAS A COMMENT- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT- I KNOW THAT HOMELESS PETS HAS BEEN A ISSUE AND PROBLEM. ALL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND COMING FROM A FAMILY OF ANIMAL LOVERS IT WAYS HAD- PETS IN WHICH WE ADOPTED FROM THE SHELTER. AND DOES CLOSE FOR NON MYSELF BUT MY BROTHER AS WELL AND EVERY TIME WE GO TO THE SHELTER AS YOU KNOW UNDER STATE LAW- WHETHER IT'S A CAT OR A DOG AND BY LAW THEY HAVE TO SPARE AND NEUTER. THESE ANIMALS. AND FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO GET THESE- TAX FROM ANIMAL SHELTERS AND THEY ALSO WANT TO PURCHASE INSURANCE. TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T NEED I THINK IS AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS IS THERE A POSSIBILITY ABOUT THE AUTHOR WOULD ANNOTATED UP AND OPT OUT FOR THOSE TYPE INDIVIDUALS THAT. ARE ADOPTING A PET FROM A SHELTER THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SPAYED HAS ALREADY BEEN NEUTERED DO YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF OPTING OUT OF THAT. TYPE OF MANDATED PAYMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN STILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS IT WASN'T RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION BUT I TRY TO BE A COALITION BUILDER WITH MY BILLS I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YOU PEOPLE- A CHOIR. HEX FROM ALL DIFFERENT IN ALL DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO IT IS STILL A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS THAT- EVEN OPT TO HAVE HAD INSURANCE- AND JUST BECAUSE YOU GET A NOT EVERYONE GETS A PET GETS A PET FROM THE SHELTER AND WE KNOW THAT MANY- SHELTERS DO REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR PETS SPAYED OR NEUTERED IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT FROM THERE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PET OWNERS THAT ARE GETTING PETS NOT FROM THEIR SHELTERS- AND SO THEY'RE ALSO GETTING PETS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN STERILIZED. TO MR VOEPEL POINT- WE LOOK AT THE TOTAL COST FOR THE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF POLICY HOLDERS THAT ACTUALLY DO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS COVERAGE- WERE THAT THAT EVERYONE WOULD ACTUALLY PAY ABOUT FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SEVEN CENTS PER MONTH AN ADDITIONAL COST- IF THIS IS LAW- SO THAT IS A SMALL- INCREASES SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT SINCE THAT HAVE COME UP. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- AS I MENTIONED- THAT THIS DOES HAPPEN THIS BILL AS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION HOWEVER- I GAVE THE MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A MOTION AND A- IT WAS PRETTY SILENT- HEY NOW AT THAT TIME- SO. I'M NOT SURE THERE WILL BE A VOTE BECAUSE NO ONE'S MADE A MOTION. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD MISS COM LOCAL YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST ASK FOR CONSIDERATION- AND HOPE THAT BEFORE- THIS COMMITTEE INTERNS THAT THAT THIS MIGHT BE M. BROUGHT UP FOR A VOTE AND THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN. I AM RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WANT FOLKS TO KNOW THAT WE HAD A VERY GOOD DISCUSSION WITH THE OPPOSITION YESTERDAY AND WE ACTUALLY ARE IN AGREEMENT ON THE CANCELLATION NOTICE WHICH IS THE PORTION OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. I'M AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT- FOLKS THAT WANT PET INSURANCE STILL REPRESENT A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE. OF THE INSURANCE POPULATION BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT NOT HAVING ANIMAL STERILIZED CONTRIBUTES TO SO MANY COSTS THAT BOTH PET OWNERS- AND CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE TO BEAR. AND THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A SOLUTION THAT WILL FIX ALL OF- YOU KNOW THE ISSUES THAT. SURROUND OVER POPULATION AND USE THAT AS A NATION OF ANIMALS BUT IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO STEP IN AND DO THEIR PART- WE DO KNOW THAT I THINK TO PANDIAN WHICH IS. A BRAND. OR A ONE OF THE PARTICULAR AT PET INSURANCE POLICY PRODUCTS- IS. SUGGESTED TO BE ONE OF THE BETTER PLANS. IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PLANS AND IT IS ALSO A PLAN THAT SAYS IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET COVERAGE YOUR PET CANNOT BE STERILIZED. SO YOU CAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ANSWER ALIVE IN ORDER TO GET THE PET INSURANCE AND THEN IF YOU WANT YOUR PET TO BE STERILIZED THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY- AN EXORBITANT FEE. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF NOT ALLOW THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ANIMAL OWNERS DO WANT THEIR PETS TO BE STERILE THOSE THAT DO DO. AND WE KNOW THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES. DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WELL WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN ANIMALS ARE NOT STERILIZED. THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER HEALTH ISSUES- THAT COMPLICATE THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE A LIFE AND ALSO. A RESULT IN MANY INCREASED COSTS TO THE PET OWNERS AND SO THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY. ON THEFRONT END TO STOP THOSE KINDS OF COSTS THAT PET OWNERS WOULD HAVE TO FACE- SO. ONCE AGAIN I'VE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR CONSIDERATION IN AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS COM LOGGER A WE'VE HAD A VERY THOROUGH DISCUSSION AND YOU'VE GIVEN THIS- VERY EARNEST. EFFORT HERE ON A SUBJECT THAT CLEARLY IS NEAR AND DEAR TO YOUR HEART. YES AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT TO MANY PEOPLE BUT- I THINK THE COMMITTEE YOU GET A SENSE OF THE COMMITTEE HEARING NOW THAT TO- ALL RIGHT WELL NEXT TIME. I COME WITH ANOTHER PET INSURANCE I WILL PERMISSION TO BRING MY PET TO MAKE A. DISPLAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU. GO AHEAD MISS GONZALEZ THANK YOU WE HAVE AN ERROR I HAVE NO PETS AS CHILDREN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AB ONE TWENTY THREE WOULD ALLOW WORKERS USING THE STATE'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM TO RECEIVE 90% INCOME REPLACEMENT UP TO- THE LIMIT OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN DOLLARS PER WEEK MISS GONZALEZ- I'M IN A SECOND- MISTER MAYES MOTIONS WITH THE MOTION SECOND ON YOUR BILL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE GOOD. GOOD ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR FRAZIER DID YOU HAVE YOU HAD A QUESTION. YES QUESTION THE AUTHOR AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU- THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS HOW YOU FORMAT IT WAS JUST ONE QUESTION I HAVE. IT JUST BASED ON ALL OF WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES AND YOU AND I HAVE. OCCURRED WITH AN EXPERIENCED. LATELY SAYS IF A FIRST CLAIM IS NOT COMPLETE THE CLAIM FORM SHALL BE RETURNED TO THE CLAIMANT FOR COMPLETION AND SHALL BE COMPLETED RETURNED AND NOT LATER THAN TEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I'M SORRY THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE AGENCIES WITH THE BACK ROADS AND WHAT AND- WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING I THINK THAT'S EXISTING LAW I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE READING FROM THE I DON'T THINK I I'VE CHANGED. THAT BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS IN THAT COMPONENT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT YOUR STAFF HAS BEEN COMPLETELY- COMPROMISE WITH THE V. D. N. STI ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO AND I JUST SANDERS THIS. IS BASICALLY YOU KNOW A PIPE DREAM AS FAR AS TEN DAYS WE WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE A REASONABLE APPROACH. AND NOT PUT THIS. THIS COMPLETE COMPONENT WITH A TEN DAY EXPECTATIONS. SO WE CAN YOU KNOW AT LEAST AS IT GOES FORWARD. LOOK AT THAT- CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY'RE GONNA MAKE THAT. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE THAT BASED ON WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED RIGHT I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE READING FROM IS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE CHANGING IT'S AN EXISTING LAW THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK.
