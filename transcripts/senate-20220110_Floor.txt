SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY THREE BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY. THANK YOU HELLO THERE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOT A PRESIDENT- ALEX- SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY THREE THOSE TWO THINGS TO SUPPORT OUR HOSPITALITY- AND THEY LIGHT INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED SO BADLY DURING THE PANDEMIC OFFERS TO CREATE A NEW LIVE MUSIC- AND ENTERTAINMENT I'LL HOLD LICENSE RIGHT NOW LIVE MUSIC VENUES HAVE A CHOICE OF EITHER GETTING A BAR LIQUOR LICENSE WHICH MEANS THAT NO ONE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE CAN ENTER FOR A RESTAURANT LIQUOR LICENSE WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO PUT IN A FULL RESTAURANT CALIBER KITCHEN WHICH IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. EVEN IF THEY'RE REALLY NOT- FOCUSED ON FOOD SERVICE SERVICE BILL WILL CREATE A NEW A LICENSE SPECIFIC TO LIVE MUSIC VENUES THESE VENUES HAVE BEEN DECIMATED BY THE PANDEMIC THEY WERE OVERWHELMINGLY CLOSE FOR MANY MANY MANY MONTHS I COULDN'T OPEN AT ALL- AND- THIS IS A GOOD STEP FOR THIS HONOR FOR AN ELEMENT OF MY LIFE IN CALIFORNIA THE SECOND. THING THE BILL DOES IS- INSANE CONTAINERS OWN CITIES CAN CURRENTLY CREATING OPEN CONTAINER ZONE FOR EXAMPLE DURING A STREET FESTIVAL- OR OTHER PUBLIC EVENTS- WHERE ALCOHOL CAN BE SOLD. HOWEVER ALCOHOL CAN ONLY BE SOLD BY A VENDOR THAT COMES IN THE OPENING TENDERS ON FROM OUTSIDE. THE BRICK AND MORTAR RESTAURANTS AND BARS THAT ARE ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY AND I ZONE OR PROHIBITED FROM SELLING. AND STREET FAIR OR FESTIVAL- SERVICE LEGISLATION WILL AUTHORIZE CITIES- WHEN THEY WHEN THEY CREATE AN OPEN CONTAINER ZONE TO ALLOW OTHER EXISTING BRICK AND MORTAR BARS AND RESTAURANTS TO PARTICIPATE- AND- FAIR OR FESTIVAL. I RESPECT WESTERN IDAHO. THANK YOU SENATOR WE- DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'M QUESTIONED THE AUTHOR. I SAID WHEN WE TAKE A QUESTION IF YOU WILL PLEASE PROCEED I APPRECIATE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT I DO HAVE ONE A QUICK QUESTION WYNN- THE PANDEMIC WAS IN FULL FORCE IN TWENTY TWENTY IN RESTAURANTS AND BARS WERE CLOSED DOWN. OF BARS AND RESTAURANTS THAT HAD A CABARET LICENSE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO OPERATE IS THIS AN ADDITIONAL LICENSE TO THE CABARET LICENSE SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE LIVE MUSIC OR IS THIS WELL THE CO INSIDER WORK TOGETHER I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF RESTAURANTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE REQUIRED TO GET AN ADDITIONAL LICENSE. THAT'S MY QUESTION. THROUGH THE THIRTEENTH PLEASE PROCEED YESTHIS IS A NEW- SEPARATE LICENSE OVER RESTAURANT HAS A RESTAURANT LYSONS- THAN A- CAN ALREADY SERVE ALCOHOL- UNDER LOCAL LAWS THEY MAY SOMETIMES. TO HAVE LIVE MUSIC AS A RESTAURANT OR BAR. YOU NEED TO GET A SEPARATE LOCAL LAND USE PERMIT TO DO THAT. AND THIS ONE AND PETER ABILITY TO DO THAT BUT THEY ALREADY HAVE. AN ALCOHOL LICENSE- THE CHALLENGE OF THE LIVE MUSIC VENUES FACES. THERE'S NO LIQUOR LICENSE THAT REALLY APPLIES TO THEM SO THEY HAVE TO PRETEND TO BE A BAR. OR PRETEND TO BE A RESTAURANT- EACH OF WHICH BRINGS SORT OF SOME CHALLENGES FOR THEM BOTH OF THEM FOR THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. SO THIS IS INTENDED TO CREATE. A LIQUOR LICENSE SPECIFIC. TO THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. C. AND HEARING ON ON THE FLOOR. OR REMOTELY CENTER WINTER YOU MAY CLOSE.
