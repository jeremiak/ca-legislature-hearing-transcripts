PAIN IS REAL. THE PAIN IS REAL

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:49.867
AND WE KNOW THAT MANY

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.168
HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ARE

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:53.604
STILL UNAWARE OF HOW TO

COMMONLY KNOWN AS SNAIL SPIT IT

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:29.794
ACTUALLY IS THE VENOM OF THE

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.464
MOST POISONOUS NAIL FOUND IN

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:06.656

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.272
ALLOWS COMPANIES TO FORCE

FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THE MORE.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:02.898
THIS MEASURE COULD VERY WELL

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:04.467

THEY HAVE A STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:12.795
MEAN ONE ATTORNEY HAS SEVEN

THOUSAND PLAINTIFFS BUT THE

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:24.073
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THESE

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.141
PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR THE

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:25.808
SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THE

REMOVED AND THE POTENTIAL THE

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.653
PENALTIES ARE JUST ASTRONOMICAL

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.021
AND THEY'RE REALLY NOT EVEN

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:39.955

AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:27.837
ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IT'S NOT

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:28.504
ASKING AN EMPLOYEE TO WAIVE

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.656
PROBLEM. WELL I KNOW THAT THERE

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.991

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.993
THIS BILL WAS VERY NARROWLY

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.829
CRAFTED. IT DOESN'T DEEM

COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:56.283
SUGGESTING THAT. THIS ISN'T

01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:57.952
NECESSARY BECAUSE THE LAW

01:35:58.018 --> 01:35:58.452
ALREADY PROVIDES FOR IT

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:03.324
ACTUALLY. TO MY FRIENDS IN THE

RECOVER UNPAID WAGES I WOULD

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:16.504
ALSO SUBMIT. THAT THIS BILL

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:17.872
DOES NOT AFFECT LAW ABIDING

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:21.575
EMPLOYERS THIS BILL IS DESIGNED

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:23.077
TO GO AFTER AN EMPLOYER WHO

01:36:23.144 --> 01:36:25.346
DOESN'T PAY WAGES TO THEIR

EMPLOYEE AND IT PROVIDES AN

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:30.317
ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY SO THAT

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:32.253
THE EMPLOYEE WOULD RECEIVE THE

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:34.421
PENALTY THAT IS ALREADY IN LAW

01:36:34.488 --> 01:36:36.223
CURRENTLY ASSESSED BY THE

01:36:38.325 --> 01:36:40.427
GOES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:42.296
NOT TO THE EMPLOYEE WHO IN MANY

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:45.032

THEIR LOW INCOME WAGES THAT ARE

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:51.705
OWED TO THEM SO WHAT THIS BILL

01:36:51.772 --> 01:36:54.008
SIMPLY DOES IS GONNA REMOVE

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:56.377
FEWER CASES FROM A PRIVATE

01:36:56.443 --> 01:36:57.912
