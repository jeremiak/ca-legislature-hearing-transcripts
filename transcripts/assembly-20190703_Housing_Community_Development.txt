GENEROUS OR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE QUORUM BUT WE WILL START. OUR AS A SUBCOMMITTEE I'M GONNA ASK MEMBERS OF OUR HOUSING COMMITTEE TO PLEASE JOIN US SO -- WITH THAT WE HAVE OUR FIRST AUTHOR FILE AND ONE SB FIVE IF I COULD ASK THE AUDIENCE TO PLEASE TAKE YOUR CONVERSATIONS. OUTSIDE AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE JUST GOT QUORUM SO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. TWO HERE TO HEAR DAVE HERE. THE PAIR GABRIELLE GABRIELLE HERE GLORIA. KILEY. LEE MON. THE MAN HERE MAIENSCHEIN QUIRK SILVA. OVER HERE AND WITH THAT WE HAVE COR AND WITH THAT SENATOR BILL -- GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MISTER CHAIRMAN -- TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB. FIVE SB FIVE AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS SO. THAT MISTER -- CENTER MCGUIRE. AND I INTRODUCED THIS YEAR WE ARE JUST AS BEFORE FIVE AND SIX THIS PACKAGE IS BASED ON INPUT ABOUT GATHERED THROUGH A SERIES OF PUBLIC HEARINGS -- WE CONVENE THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- LAST FALL. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING -- CRISIS IS STAGGERING. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CALIFORNIA HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE THE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND NECESSARY NEW HOUSING UNITS PER YEAR. AS A RESULT NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN LIVED IN OUR STREETS LAST YEAR. THIS IS OFTEN A MISCONCEPTION ABOUT. WHO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE SAY HOMELESS? COLLEGE STUDENTS WORKING FAMILIES OUR NEIGHBORS ARE BEING PUSHED INTOHOMELESS THOSE. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE RISING RENTS. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A HISTORIC ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO HELP SHELTER THOSE ON OUR CITY STREETS. AND PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FUNDS TO GET LOCAL GOVERNMENT INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS BUT REALLY FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF ARE HOMELESS. NOW THIS PROBLEM WHICH IS THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THERE ARE TWO POINT TWO MILLION. EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND VERY LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS. COMPETING FOR ONLY SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES. THIS LEAVES MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS OF THE LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO HOUSING AND AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES. DESPITE THE BEST INTENTIONS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH THE EVER GROWING PRODUCTION NEEDS TO KEEP BRENT BURDEN AND VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES OFF OUR STREETS. MARKET RATE HOUSING IS PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT WITHOUT DELIBERATE INVESTMENTS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT CONTRIBUTES TO A RISING COST OF RENTS THAT'S WHY THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN ALL ITS ONGOING FUNDS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SB FIVE MAKES THE STATE A LONG TERM FINANCIAL PARTNER. TO IMMEDIATELY CONSTRUCT NEEDED HOUSING FOR HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS AND COMPLIMENTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND OUR RECENT -- TWENTY NINETEEN INVESTMENT. THE BILL CREATES A EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NEW AND REHABILITATED HOUSING UNITS. HELPS REAL. BILL OF LEVY A POVERTY CREATE JOBS. AND MEETS OUR STATE WHERE TO BERMAN GOALS WITHOUT AFFECTING SCHOOL FUNDING. SPECIFICALLY SB FIVE ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COLLABORATE ON ON STATE APPROVED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS. WHICH WOULD BE FUNDED BY REDUCING THE CONTRIBUTION FOR THE EDUCATIONAL REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUND FOR EMPHASIS WILL BE PAGE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR VERY LOW. LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES AS WELL AS TRANSIT OR IN PRIORITY PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY INFILL DEVELOPMENTS IN PROJECTS THAT MITIGATE. THE THE FACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE IN CLIMATE CHANGE ARE ALSO PRIORITIZE. THE BILL WILL CREATE A CAP ON AVAILABLE FUNDING A TWO HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ANNUALLY AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AFTER THE PROGRAM IS WRAPPED UP THE TOTAL ANNUAL GENERAL FUND SPENDING COULD EXCEED -- TWO HUNDRED TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THE STATE GENERAL FUNDS WILL BE USED TO BACK FILL SCHOOLS. LEGISLATURE CONSISTS BAND NEW PLANS DURING FISCAL DOWNTURNS. THE BILL ALIGNS WITH OTHER STATE FEDERAL PROGRAMS TO ENSURE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL NON STATE. GENERAL FUNDS THE LEGISLATION CREATES A STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS TO ENSURE FUNDS ARE ONLY SPENT ON DESIGNATED PROJECTS AND TO PROTECT SCHOOL FUNDING. THE BILL CREATES A STATE COMMITTEE HOUSING. HOUSE AND H. C. D.. TO REVIEW AND APPROVE PROPOSED PLANS PROVIDING STRONG STATE OVERSIGHT. COMMITTEES ALSO IN POWER TO TAKE CORRECTION CORRECTIVE ACTION WHEN LOCALS DO NOT MEET THEIR PLANS OBJECTIVES. IT'S OF THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF BUSINESS LABOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOUSING ADVOCATES -- MISSED TERMINAL TURNED MY WITNESSES -- WE HAVE SAYS OUR DS FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADE. AND CHASE AND RYAN AS LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR RIDLEY CALIFORNIA CITIES. TARA MY WITH THIS MISTER JOHN YOUR WITNESSES. MISTER MEMBER SISTER DIEM HALF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL PROUD US SUPPORT OF SB FIVE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A CREATIVE POLICY. TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ASSIST THEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING INFILL DEVELOPMENT. AND PLANNING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ALL THIS IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHILE ENSURING GOOD JOBS TO THE USE OF PREVAILING WAGE IN A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE THAT ADDRESSES THE PERCEIVED TO WORK FOR SHORTAGE IN THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET. IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THAT YOU SEE A BILL THAT HAS ALL OF THESE -- ATTRIBUTES -- INCLUDED IN IT. IT'S A VERY CREATIVE SOLUTION IT'S A A WIDE RANGE OF COALITION AND STAKEHOLDERS OUT -- DEVELOPED THIS POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT. WELL IMPORTANT FUNDING HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THROUGH SB TO AN SB THREE OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE FACT IS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED ONGOING FINANCING TOOLS TO HELP FUND PROJECTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE BROADER INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION. SB FIVE ALSO SEEKS TO FILL THE GAP LEFT BY THE DISSOLUTION OF PARTY ETS THE REDEVELOPMENT -- SAYS -- AGENCIES. AND PROVIDES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUNDING THAT WILL HELP WORKING FAMILIES. WITH THE CONTINUES THE RISING COST OF HOUSING AND THE EVER GROWING PROBLEM OF INCOME INEQUALITY IN THE STATE. THE PREVAILING WAGE UNSKILLED UNTRAINED ARE PROVISIONS ARE IMPORTANT LABOR PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ONLY LEAD TO GOOD CONSTRUCTION BUT ALSO ENSURE THAT THIS CRITICALLY NEEDED. THESE GRILL YOU NEED A PROJECTS ARE BUILT WITH THE HIGHEST GUILD LABOR -- THAT IS AVAILABLE AND ALSO ADDRESSES THE WORK FOR SHORTAGE BY ENSURING THAT THERE'S APPRENTICES ACTUALLY ON THOSE JOBS SO THAT ALSO ALLOWS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EXITING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN GOING THROUGH. A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM TO ENTER THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT STATE APPROVED SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSING GOALS AND PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO WORK TOGETHER TO REVITALIZE COMMUNITIES AND BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WE'VE TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S IN THE THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO TO REALLY FOCUS IN ON ON AN ITEM THAT YOU KNOW YOU CARE DEEPLY ABOUT OVER THE YEARS IN A FOUGHT EVERY YEAR FOR AND THAT'S THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. ON THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THERE WHICH I THINK IS IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT I'M WHILE IT IS ONE TIME FUNDING YOU KNOW IT WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT EFFORT AND GRADUALLY YOU IN YOUR EFFORTS. TO TO GET THAT INCLUDED SB FIVE REALLY BUILDS OFF THAT IN SB FIVE WOULD WOULD BE A LONG TERM PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YOU KNOW CITY SOMETIMES ARE BLAMED FOR PUTTING A BEARS AND AND NOT WANTING TO TO NECESSARILY BE PARTNERS WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOUSING IN GENERAL AND I THINK FROM THIS BILL YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF CITIES WHO ARE LINING UP AND SAYING PLEASE PARTNER WITH US WERE WILLING TO PUT UP OUR OWN DOLLARS. IF THE STATE'S WILLING TO PUT UP SOME OF THEIR DOLLARS AND WE CAN TEAM UP AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS AND THOSE COMMON GOALS. ARE REALLY OUTLINED IN THE BILL BUT THEY'RE ALSO OUTLINED IN IN PREVIOUS BILLS YOU KNOW IT'S ALL ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURES ABOUT INFILL IT'S ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE NEAR TRANSIT IT'S ARE DOING MORE DENSITY. LORRAINE GHGS THESE ARE ALL COMMON GOALS THAT WE A CITY SHARE WITH THE STATE -- AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT TO SUPPORT THOSE WITHTHE DOLLARS BUT ALSO WILL ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS -- I ALSO THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THIS BILL BUILDS OFF OF THE REALLY HARD WORK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE'S DONE. OVER THE PAST FIVE OR SEVEN YEARS WHEN YOU GUYS BROUGHT BACK -- YOU KNOW III OF TEASING CREE IS AND YOU GAVE US THESE POWERFUL TOOLS -- TO GET UNITS CONSTRUCTED THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT WAS ONE REALLY KEY INGREDIENT THAT WAS MISSING AND I WAS FUNDING AND THIS BILL DOES THAT SO IT'S ACTUALLY YOU KNOW BY PASSING THIS BILL AND ALLOCATING THE FUNDS -- YOU'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW TO FUND THE ACT OF THE VERY -- PROGRAMS YOU GUYS CONSTRUCTED I AND WE CAN GET OUT THERE AND START GETTING UNITS -- BUILT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ONE FINAL THING I I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THOUGH IS THAT -- THIS BILL NOT ONLY IS A SORT OF A CITIES BUT IS SUPPORTED BY YOU KNOW BROAD COALITION AND I THINK THAT REALLY LENDS TO THE TO THE MERITS OF THE MEASURE AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD STRONGLY APPRECIATE. TO A SUPPORT POSITION ON THIS BILL AND MOVE BEFORE OTHER SUPPORTERS. RICHARD MEMBERS SYLVIA SILLY SHAUN BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS AND SUPPORT.

MORNING MR JERMICHAEL IN SKI CITY OF ROSEVILLE AND STRONG SUPPORT. THE MORNING HERE IN THE CITY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF ALAMEDA AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] THANK. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BOB NAYLOR I REPRESENT FEELS SUDDEN COMPANY WHICH IS HOWARD ALMONDS IN JUNIOR. IS -- AS A RESIDENT ORANGE COUNTY AS AN LONG CONCERNED ABOUT THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF REDEVELOPMENT [inaudible] ON MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORT THE GOVERNOR BROWN'S EFFORT -- TO DISSOLVE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. WE REALLY RESPECT SENATOR BELL AND HIS TIRELESS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT WE THINK MOVING TO A REDEVELOPMENT MODEL AS AS PROBLEMATIC FOR SEVERAL REASONS. ONE IS -- EMINENT DOMAIN ABUSE THAT IS THE TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY FROM UNWILLING SELLERS. SOMETIMES LEAVING IT VACANT FOR MANY MANY YEARS OFTEN IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND EVENTUALLY TURNING IT OVER OVER TO OTHER. PRIVATE DEVELOPERS. AT AND TO ACCOMMODATE A LOCAL PLAN. THE RECORD ONTHAT HAS BEEN VERY SKETCHY NOW I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER EMINENT DOMAIN AS PART OF THIS BILL BUT AND ON PAGE TWENTY FOUR LINE. TWENTY TWO THE NEW AGENCIES CREATED UNDER THIS BILL OR GET ARM POWER TO DO ANY OTHER ACT THAT IS NECESSARY. AND OUR LEGAL COUNSEL -- AND WE CONSULTED AS WELL THE PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION AGREE THAT THAT ENCOMPASSES ANY OTHER ACT INCLUDING EMINENT DOMAIN. AND ALSO THIS MONEY CAN GO TO SEE OUR I. A.'S ONE OF THE LOCAL REDEVELOPMENT. ITEMS THAT THAT WAS ENACTED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THAT IS EXPLICITLY GRANTED EMINENT DOMAIN POWER -- SECONDLY -- WE THINK THIS BILL HAS SERIOUS FISCAL PROBLEMS. IN THAT IT COULD CREATE A TWO BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR -- OBLIGATION OVER THIRTY YEARS TO PAY OFF THE BONDS THAT ARE ISSUED BY LOCAL AGENCIES AGAINST THE FUNDING STREAM. THAT MEANS THAT IN TIMES OF RECESSION -- YOU'VE GOT. NO FLEXIBILITY YOU CAN'T CUT THAT PROGRAM -- YOU HAVE TO KEEP PAYING OFF THOSE BONDS WERE STILL PAYING OFF BONDS FROM THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AT TO THE TUNE OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE FROM THE GENERAL FUND SO. ALL OTHER PROGRAMS IN RECESSION OR SO INCLUDING. EDUCATION ARE SUBJECT. TO BEING REDUCE [inaudible] THIRDLY. ONLY 50% OF THE MONEY IN THESE THE IN THIS BILL. HAS TO GO TO HOUSING. WE THINK IT IS SUPERIOR TO HAVE A GRANT PROGRAM. ANNUALLY. APPROPRIATED AS PART OF THE BUDGET. THAT IS PAYS YOU GO AND IS TARGETED 1100% TO HOUSING. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE JOURNAL VOTE ON THIS BILL. THEY'RE BACK WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION -- WE HAVE A AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMEND A POSITION I JUST BEFORE I BEGIN JUST WANNA THANK THE SENATOR FOR WORKING WITH US -- OUR COALITION -- IS OFFICE AND THE STAFF HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUS AND LISTEN TO OUR CONCERNS -- WE JUST SIMPLY HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE ABOUT THE USE OF THE RAF FUNDING. EDUCATION FUNDING TO PAY FOR HOUSING. OUR POSITION IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING TO PAY. FOR HOUSING ISSUES IF IT'S A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AS MY A PREVIOUS. SPEAKER IT MENTIONED THERE THAT THE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DEDICATE FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE WE ALSO POINT TO PROPOSITION ONE FROM LAST YEAR THAT SET ASIDE FOR BILLION DOLLARS. IN STATE APPROVED BONDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AS WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S ALREADY A MECHANISM BY WHICH TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT DOESN'T HAVE. TO IMPACT THE STABILITY OF EDUCATION FUNDING OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY OUT WHEN ECONOMIC TIMES BECOME CHALLENGING WHAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE DO IN THE FUTURE YEARS. WHAT WILL THIS LEGISLATURE JAIL IF THERE'S A FISCAL CRISIS AND HOW WILL THAT BE TREATED I KNOW THAT THE BILL SPEAKS TO INTENT LANGUAGE ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS -- AT THE KEEPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS HOLE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT WILL THEY ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT. THISBILL DOESN'T HOLD THEIR HAND TO THAT. AND IT LEAVES IT OPEN ENDED AND THAT CONCERN AND UNCERTAINTY IS OUR CONCERN. I'M FOR THAT REASON WE JUST SIMPLY HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE ABOUT USING THE EDUCATION FUNNY PAY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING DAVID WALL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND MISTER CHAIRMAN RESPECTING YOU TO WITNESS SAYS PER OPPOSE. ASIDE I'LL JUST SAY WE ARE OPPOSED -- REFLECTING EXACTLY THE VIEWS THAT MISTER NAYLOR TO SHARED THANK YOU. LIVES WITH US WELL THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS THANK YOU. OKAY SHILOH LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE OPPOSE ON AS AMENDED. JENNER JENNIFER BESTER FROM EDUCATE OUR STATE THERE ARE NINETEEN COUNTIES WHO'S THE RAF FUNDS ARE COMPLETELY DEPLETED BY THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE SWAP. THIS WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THIS THAT MEANS THAT IN THOSE NINETEEN COUNTIES KERN SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARDINO. THE FIRST DOLLAR. TO FUND THIS WILL COME OUT OF DIRECT TAX ALLOCATION TO SCHOOLS. IN MY COUNTY SAN MATTEO IT WILL COME OUT FROM THE POOREST SCHOOLS. IT WILL COME OUT FOR THE POOREST SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT RECEIVE LCF OF FUNDING SO IT WILL COME FROM REDWOOD CITY. FROM EAST PALO ALTO FROM DALY CITY. IT WILL NOT COME FROM WOULD SIDE. FROM HILLSBOROUGH FROM RIVERSIDE FOR THAT MATTER MANY OF THE THE CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED HERE PALO ALTO. DO NOT RECEIVE ANY ELSE HALF OF FUNDING SO THEY CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE BACKS OF THEIR POOREST NEIGHBORS WE CANNOT KEEP THROWING SCHOOL CHILDREN. UNDER THE BUS THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET US BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMóN. THANK YOU I I'D. TO ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS RELATED TO THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY WHICH IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO US -- IN THE INFORMATION WE SUPPLIED TO THE COMMITTEE -- BEFORE WE WENT DOWN THIS ROAD. WE ASK THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. EXAMINE. HW THE BILL? IMPACTS SCHOOL FINANCE. AND THEY HAVE SUBMITTED A WRITTEN REPORT THAT YOU CAN READ THAT ACTUALLY INDICATES. THAT THE BILL WILL HAVE NO FISCAL IMPACT ON THE SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY BACK FILLED. OF THE MONEY IS COMPLETELY BACK FILLED IN THE IN THE GENERAL FUND -- ALLOCATION THAT BACK FEELS THE HE RALPH FUND THAT'S DIVERTED TO THESE PROGRAMS. SO IN ESSENCE -- THERE IS NO IMPACT ON SCHOOLS -- WE ALSO HAVE -- LOOKED AT THE ISSUE OF BACK FILLING THE SCHOOLS RATE REGARDING THE CALCULATION TEST ONE TEST TO TEST. THREE IN TERMS OF PROP. NINETY EIGHT AND WE PUT LANGUAGE THAT -- HAS AN AUTOMATIC BACK FILL IN AN AND TELL US ONE YEARS WHICH IS THE WHEN IT GETS KIND OF TIGHT -- THE BILL CALLS FOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO RE BRANCH THE PROP NINETY EIGHT BACK FILLSO THAT -- ABSOLUTELY NO DOLLARS ARE LOST TO THE SCHOOLS. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO UNDER THIS BILL THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR. CAN'T SUSPEND APPROVAL OF NEW PLANTS DURING FISCAL DOWNTURNS WHEN THERE'S A RAINY DAY -- FUND OR WHEN PROP NINETY EIGHT IS SUSPENDED SUSPENDED SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT YOU CAN. OF SUSPEND THIS THIS -- PROGRAM. SO -- WE HAVE PUT THOSE GUARANTEES IN THE BILL -- I I THINK DID -- OF GUARANTEEING THAT -- IS REFERABLE. TO JUST LETTING -- REDEVELOPMENT TAX INCREMENTS -- IN. REDUCE THE PROPERTY TAX AND I KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROVED -- BECAUSE I'M ON THE GOVERNMENT FINANCE COMMITTEE WHICH IS MADE A FEW MINUTES -- WE HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT OR NINE BILLS. THAT ACTUALLY. DO MUCH MORE PROPERTY TAX DIVERSION IN THIS BILL BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS NO PROPERTY TAX DIVERSION -- THAT WILL NOT BE BACK FILLED BY THE GENERAL FUND. SO SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHY -- WE PROPOSE THIS BILL SO WE WOULD GUARANEE THE SCHOOLS FUNDING -- THE OTHER ISSUE MAYBE OF CAN RESTED EMINENT DOMAIN ISSUE THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE IN A DONE AND WE WE DID NOT CHANGE THE CURRENT LAW. ON ANNA DOMAINS WE DID NOT CREATE -- ANY CHANGES IN IN -- DOMAIN FOR ANY OF THESE ENTITIES -- SO WE DO NOT ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE -- IN THE BILL AND I THINK THAT -- THE OTHER ISSUE I WANT TO POINT OUT IS -- IN A DOMAIN HAS BEEN USED. WHEN OF REDEVELOPMENT STYLE DEVELOPMENT OCCURS WHEN THEY DO CLEARING A PROPERTY -- THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TAX INCREMENTS -- DEVELOPMENTS WITH REDEVELOPMENT KIND OF PROJECTS THIS BILL DOES NOT. FOCUS ON THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS THIS BILL FOCUSES ON BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CITIES. AND COUNTIES AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THIS BILL IS NOT A REDEVELOPMENT BILL. IS NOT A TAX INCREMENT FINANCE BILL IT IS NOT A BILL THAT -- CLEARS LAND AND EMPHASIZES THAT THIS BILL EMPHASIZES. BUILDING THE HOUSING IN EXISTING COMMUNITIES AND BUILDING YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE BUILDING STRONG NEIGHBORHOODS -- BUILDING -- OF TRANSIT OR IN DEVELOPMENT INFILL DEVELOPMENT THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS AS OPPOSED TO A REDEVELOPMENT STYLE. OF DEVELOPMENT SO I THINK I THINK READ YOU KNOW I CHAIR THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN SAN JOSE. WE HAD THE SECOND LARGEST REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN THE IN THE IN THE STATE. AND THIS BILL IS NOT REDEVELOPMENT. THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS IS A NEW APPROACH TO IMPROVING OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WILL NOTE THAT I THINK IN A LOT OF CASES THESE ARE BOTH COMPELLING AND COMPETING INTERESTS -- A IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME STUDENTS -- THAT I HAVE FOUND AS A FORMER EDUCATOR AT WHO DON'T HAVE HOUSING -- SOME OF THE STUDENTS AT SCHOOLS WITH ELL CFF -- ARE THE ONES THAT ARE LIVING IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS SHARING -- ROOMS IN HOME SO I THINK IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO RECOGNIZE THAT. TO BETTER SERVE -- OUR STUDENTS WE ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE HOUSING AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE HOUSING AS WELL -- SO I THINK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA MORNING. GOOD MORNING AND THE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS THOUGHTFUL BILL FORWARD. COULD YOU AKE A COMMENT ON THE BONDS BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME INFERENCE RELATED TO THE BONDS ON THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND ALSO THE STATE BONDS -- OKAY. THIS BILL DOES NOT ENGAGE OR ALLOW OR CREATE STATE BONDING. SO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STATE MONNING OKAY -- THIS BILL ALLOWS FINANCING -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LIKE THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCES DISTRICT FREE -- ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THOSE THINGS ALLOW. THE LOCAL ENTITY TO DO USE THAT REVENUE SOURCE TO BOND THIS DOES THE SAME IT SIMPLY ALLOWS IF THEY WANT TO IN THEIR PLAN. THEY DON'T HAVE TO IT'S AN OPT IN KIND OF THING THEY THIS IS -- OPTIONAL. POPPED IN PROGRAM IF THEY WANT TO MAKE A PROPOSITION. THAT -- THE MONEY CAN BE USED FOR BONDING IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE THAT. OKAY SO IT'S IS SERVE AN OPT IN AND IT'S NOT A MANDATED BONDING IF THEY CAN USE IT FOR PLEASURE GO KIND OF PROGRAMS IF THEY CHOOSE. THANK YOU AND ALSO NOTE THAT -- SPEAKING ABOUT BOND SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- ACTUALLY CHOOSE TO GO OUT FOR BONDS AND MANY OF SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROW SO AN EXAMPLE IN MY OFSPECIFIC DISTRICT I LIVE IN FULLERTON WAY OF THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THAT'S JUST GONNA OUT FOR A BOND THE FULLER TEN UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S JUST. GONE OUT FOR A BOND AND THE FULLER TEN ELEMENTARY SO THAT'S THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS JUST RIGHT IN MY CITY SO THERE IS NOT A LACK OF INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS GOING OUT FOR BONDS -- SETTLING LEE ON THE EMINENT DOMAIN AGAIN LOOKING AT MY COUNTY NORTH ORANGE COUNTY I KNOW -- AS A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER THAT WAS ALWAYS QUITE. A THREAT OF YOU WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO EMINENT DOMAIN DOMAIN. WE'VE HAD A PROPERTY AND FULLER TEN WITH LITERALLY A POOL THAT WAS OWNED BY TWENTY OWNERS AND IT'S TAKEN TWENTY YEARS TO STILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE THAT PROPERTY WHICH IS IN A VERY. UNDERSERVED AREA SO YOU HAVE A POOL AREA SITTING THERE WITH ITS LAND WHERE THE COMMUNITIES WANTED TO MAKE IT INTO A PARK AND BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN OF EMINENT DOMAIN IT'S NEVER HAPPENED THAT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS IN THE MAKING. BUT I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM SANTA BARBARA THAT I AM A THIRTY YEAR C. T. A MEMBER AND VERY MUCH SUPPORT EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO PROTECT EDUCATIONAL FUNDING AND PRINT AND INVEST IN EDUCATION ALL. FUNDING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BASIC NEEDS OF FAMILIES AND WE LOOK AT WHAT COMES FIRST IF THE FAMILY DOESN'T HAVE A HOME. AND THEY CANNOT I HAVE ANY CERTAINLY OF WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE AT NIGHT WHETHER IT'S ON A COUCH WHETHER LIVING WITH THREE OR FOUR FAMILIES IN A ONE TO TWO BEDROOM. APARTMENT AND BY THE WAY THAT HAPPENS IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY IN FULLERTON BECAUSE I WORKED IN AND TAUGHT AT THE HIGHEST TITLE ONE SCHOOL WITH ALMOST A THOUSAND OF A SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNERS. THEN IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THAT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE EVEN IF WE INVEST WITH LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET THEM TO SCHOOL. WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IN MANY SCHOOLS I CAN WEAR A UNIFORM TO GET THERE SO EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH EDUCATION ABOUT READING WRITING AND MATH. COME SECONDARY TO YOUR BASIC NEEDS OF WHERE WE GONNA LIVE THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS TEACHERS ARE ALSO PART OF THIS. NEW -- GROWING COMMUNITY THAT CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING IN THE AREAS THEY TEACH WHETHER IT'S OAKLAND OR SAN FRANCISCO OR ORANGE COUNTY SO THIS IS NOT -- SIMPLY -- LET'S PUSH THIS ALONG BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO MORE HOUSING THIS IS A CRISIS EVERY SINGLE DAY -- NOT ONLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE EXPERIENCING CRISIS THAT SHOULD BE NOTED AS A MORAL CRISIS AND INTEL WE START DOING THE ACTION THAT IS NECESSARY WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE KIDS SITTING IN CLASSROOMS. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THERE. AND SO -- WHEN WE HAVE SAID LOCAL GOVERNMENT? SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED TO MAKE THEIR OWN DISICK DECISIONS THEY HAVE TO ACCOUNT THAT IF CAN FAMILIES CANNOT GET THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO CALL HOME. THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS AS A PRIORITY AND PERHAPS IT SWITCHES AROUND ONCE WE MAKE THIS HOUSING INVESTMENT -- AND WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION WE WON'T CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS SO I SUPPORT THIS AND MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE TO RUN -- TO PRESENT IN YOUR HOUSE BUT JUST WANTED TO COMPLIMENT YOU ON AN EXCELLENT PIECE OF LEGISLATION APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD ABOUT IT WOULD ASK TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. SOME AMERICAN THE SENATE ABOUT ONE DAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONVERSATIONS -- ON THE BELL AND I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT -- THE PROVISION SAID ABOUT ONE OF THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES -- ON PAGE -- TWENTY FOUR ACTUALLY BEGINS ON PAGE -- TWENTY THREE AND WHAT'S THE THE THE POWERS OF THE AGENCY -- AND THE THE WITNESS CITED SUBSECTION G. ANY OTHER ACT THAT'S NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT A PROJECT AS POTENTIALLY ENCOMPASSING EMINENT DOMAIN DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT INTERPRETATION [inaudible] WELL. WHAT I SAY ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN ON THIS IS? THERE ARE OTHER SECTIONS OF THE BILL THAT. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF EMINENT DOMAIN SHOULD LOOK OUT? OF FOR EXAMPLE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE BILL'S FOCUSES ON BUILDING IN FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOT A BLIGHT OR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S NOT THE EMPHASIS OF THIS BILL IT'S THE FORD ABOUT HOUSING. THERE ARE SECTIONS OF THIS BILL THAT ALSO INCLUDE TENANT PROTECTION SUCH AS ANTI DISPLACEMENT. PROTECTIONSOF THIS -- BILL DOES NOT CHANGE CURRENT STATUTES ON EMINENT DOMAIN. OF THAT COULD BE A FULL. DISCUSSION IF WE WANT TO HAVE THAT PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION SO THIS THIS BILL IS SORT OF NEUTRAL -- ON IT IT DOES PROVIDE. FINANCING FOR PROJECTS. AND THE FINANCING OF THE PROJECTS. OF WHICH ARE GOOD PROJECTS HOUSING AND SO FORTH -- CONCEIVABLY COULD USE EMINENT DOMAIN OKAY. BUT IN TERMS OF THE TENET PROTECTIONS IF THE HOUSING IS IN AN AREA THAT'S TYPICALLY ZONE RESIDENTIAL. AND THERE'S PEOPLE LIVING THERE THERE'S TENER PROTECTIONS IN ANTI DISPLACEMENT -- CLAUSES IN THE BILL THAT PROBABLY WOULD RESULT IN NO EMINENT DOMAIN. ON THOSE ON THE AND THAT KIND OF PROJECTS SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A BILL THAT WOULD LIMIT THEM A DOMAIN BY THOSE MEANS. SO IT ACTUALLY -- AS OPPOSED TO OTHER. TYPES OF FINANCING. ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES EMINENT DOMAIN IN MY OPINION OKAY THAT'S MY ANSWER QUESTIONS DOES NOT PRECLUDE IT BUT IT DISCOURAGES IT. IS CERTAINLY DISCOURAGES AT MORE THAN OTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -- STATUES THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS. THAT ENCOURAGE -- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS SO. WOULD THERE BE A WAY TO MAKE IT SORT OF MORE EXPLICIT IN THE BILL THAT -- IS THE APPROVAL OF PROJECTS -- WILL AT LEAST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT -- LIMITS ON THE USE OF EMINENT DOMAIN OR OR OTHERWISE PUT SAFEGUARDS IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN WE DID THAT WOULD HAVE A A MAJOR BLOW UP THE ISSUE AND HAVE A MAJOR. DISCUSSION. OF ON ON THE SUBJECT OF AN INTIMATE. I THINK -- DO YOU WANT TO HAVE THE I'VE NEVER SEEN A PROPOSAL TO DO THAT -- NOBODY'S GIVEN ME A PROPOSAL TO DO THAT SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE BILL IS REALLY LIMITED AND DOMAIN -- YOU SHOULD TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS AND DECIDE ON HOW YOU WANT TO ACT ON THE BILL [inaudible] OKAY. OUR FIRST YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A LARA I ALSO WANT THINKCENTRE BELL FOR ECHO COMING IN IN IN IN ME WITH ME YESTERDAY -- BASED ON THE CONVERSATION THAT THAT -- WE HAD THIS MORNING -- TESTIMONY FROM A SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES THIS THAT ARE AGAINST THIS BILL -- ICE WILL HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION BECAUSE OF CENTER YOUR YOU STATED ON ON MULTIPLE TIMES THAT -- THIS IS NOT -- THIS IS NOT A A RECREATION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THAT IT'S MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOCUS. BUT THE THE THE OTHER GENTLEMAN WHO TESTIFIED AGAINST YOUR BILL SAYS THAT. ONLY 50% OF THE OF THE OF THE FINANCING MECHANISM WOULD GO INTO -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- WHICH LEAVE THE OTHER 50% -- TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO. GENTRIFICATION SUPPLY CONTROL OF WHETHER IT'S FOR A PUBLIC PROJECT OR OR EIGHT ABA PRIVATE PROJECT -- AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHERE -- MY CONCERN COMES IN BECAUSE IF. IT WAS 50% AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND YOU LEAVE THE OTHER FIFTY PERCENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO A TO DO WHAT THEY FEEL LIKE KILLING AND AND A COMING FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- I KNOW THAT I'M GONNA BE COMPELLED -- AS A MEMBER OF THE THE CITY COUNCIL TO GO AND LOOK FOR A CAR DEALERSHIP OR ANY KIND OF OF SALES TAX. GENERATING. IS IS IS AND AND AND WERE CONCERNED THAT WITHOUT WILL -- SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN YOUR BILL THAT WOULD AT LEAST -- PRE VET LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM. THE SIZING AMADOR ME. OF FOR A TO TO TO TAKE PROPERTY AWAY FROM ONE OF PRIVATE ENTITY TO GIVE TO ANOTHER ONE FOR COMMERCIAL USE. OF THAT'S THAT THAT'S OUR CONCERN AND AND AND AND I KNOW THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO ADDRESS OF RIGHT HERE -- BUT THAT'S TO SOMETHING THAT I FELT REALLY TO SHARE WITH YOU AS TO WHY I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THE JUST JUST A CORRECTION IF I COULD -- THE BILL HAS FIVE PURPOSES OF THE BILL -- INDICATES THAT A MINIMUM OF 50% OF THE FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEN THERE'S FIVE SEPARATE CATEGORIES THAT THE MONEY CAN BE USED -- FOR THREE OF THE FIVE CATEGORIES RELATE TO HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OKAY. SO -- GENERALLY THE ESTIMATE THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT THE BILL HAVE ANALYZE IT THEY BELIEVE BELIEVE THAT ABOUT. TIME ON THIS BILL WILL BE SPENT ON HOUSING OKAY. AND THEN THE SECOND THING I LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT IF YOU'RE CITY. HAS FAILED TO ACHIEVE ITS HOUSING GOALS. THERE IS ALSO A PROVISION IN THE BILL. THAT YOU CAN ONLY OUT OF THE FIVE CATEGORIES YOU CAN ONLY SPEND ON THREE OF THE CATEGORIES. AND THOSE THREE CATEGORIES ARE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CATEGORIES. SO IT ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE NOT COMPLIED. WITH YOUR HOUSING GOALS. YOU HAVE TO SPEND IT ONLY ON THE HOUSING CATEGORIES. SO SO -- I THINK IT IT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES -- OUR CITIES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TO COMPLETE. THERE ARE HOUSING -- REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT'S WHY THAT BILL WAS ADDED IN YOUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE WE WE INCLUDE THOSE AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE. SO THANK YOU. HEATHER QUESTIONS. CENTER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR COMMITTEE ON THIS -- AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AROUND. INCREASING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF HOW MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE LOST AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE DEMISE OF OF REDEVELOPMENT -- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CREATIVE APPROACH YOU'VE TAKEN WITH THIS BILLS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A A BILL WITH -- WITH ANALOGOUS -- GOALS -- AND INTERESTS ARE AB ELEVEN BILL -- AND TO LOOK FOR MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT. THE ONLY THING I'LL MENTION IS -- THERE IS A PORTION OF THE ANALYSIS THAT RAISES. SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT WE RECEIVED -- AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE AS WELL ABOUT WHETHER THE BOND MARKET WILL FIND -- THE STRUCTURE SECURE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT ISSUE IN DEBT I THINK IT IS WORTH CONVERSATIONS IN BOTH OF OUR HOUSES WE TRY TO ENGAGE IN THESE IDEAS -- WITH ENSURING. THAT WERE ACTUALLY ON A TOOT TOOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOND MARKETS TO REACT TO WHAT WE ARE DOING. UP MY HOPE IS IN THE NEAR TERM WITH THE APPROACH IS THAT WE HAVE MOVED FOR FROM THIS COMMITTING YOURS WE CAN FIND WAYS FOR BOTH OF THESE APPROACHES TO COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER. OUTLOOK FOR TO THAT UP WITH THAT -- WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY A LESSER ANY FINAL COMMENTS. THANK YOU THERE'S BEEN A MOTION WITH THE BILL IN A SECOND ANY FINAL COMMENTS CENTER. I VOTE ON THE BILL MADAM QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE IN THE FUTURE MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY -- COMEDIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHIU. CHIU I DATE. NO THE NOW GABRIELLE.

WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND ALSO FACING HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE -- A STUDIES MANY STUDIES THAT -- FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE ON PAROLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS ARE SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY. TO RECIDIVISTS GO BACK INTO CRIMINAL JUSTICE BEHAVIOR OF IF THEY ARE NOT HOUSE VERSUS THOSE THAT OUR HOUSE. OF SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS IS A PROVEN METHOD OF REDUCING RECIDIVISM. SO IF HOUSING KEEPS PEOPLE FROM GOING BACK TO PRISON WE SHOULD TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THAT. AND WE'VE TRIED WE STARTED THIS PROGRAM IS MADE OF WHICH IS CALLED THE INTEGRATED SERVICES WERE MENTALLY ILL PAROLEES. IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN HOWEVER THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS NOT IN LINE WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATIVE INTENT. IN 200-018-30050 PARTICIPANTS AND IS ONE OF ONLY THREE PEOPLE WERE HOMELESS AND THE HOUSING THAT THE OR PROVIDED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM IS VERY TEMPORARY. HOUSING. SO WE HAVE A UCLA STUDY IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT FOUND THE THIS PROGRAM TO FAIL IT FAILS TO SECRETLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND THAT'S CONTINUE TO BE VALIDATED AS WE OVER OVER TIME. SO -- THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY -- PROVIDES AN AVERAGE OF TEN MONTHS OF TREATMENT ON AVERAGE BEFORE PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OUT OF THE PROGRAM -- THE THE THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION SHOES USES THIS PROGRAM TO PAY ESSENTIALLY A 100% OF THE COST OF MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. INSTEAD OF A ROLLING THEM AND MEDICARE ALL WHICH IS THE COMMON THING THAT HAPPENS NOW WITH FOR ALL THESE. AND THEY CAN DRAW DOWN A FEDERAL MATCH. FOR ONE DOLLAR THEY GET A DOLLAR AND FEDERAL FUNDS AT LEAST. SO IT DOES NOT MAKE A FISCAL SENSE TO CONTINUE FUNDING THE PROGRAM. THAT A 100%. IS USED FOR MEDICINE WHEN WE CAN GET THEM MORE ALMOST EVERY PERSON LEAVING. OUR STATE FACILITIES ARE ELIGIBLE -- FOR MEDI CAL -- THIS BILL RE DIRECTS THE PROGRAM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING COMMUTE DEVELOPMENT TO PARTNER WITH COUNTIES TO ENSURE PARTICIPANTS CAN ACCESS. THE MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER HEALTH CARE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT THROUGH MEDI CAL. AND BY REQUIRING COUNTIES TO UTILIZE MEDI CAL. UNDER THE CURRENT -- PROGRAM WE ARE DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS WE ACTUALLY GET MORE MONEY. INTO THIS SERVICE. THERE BY DIRECTING THE PROGRAMS FUNDING TOWARDS SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- AND ITS STRUCTURE TO USE STATE DOLLARS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY. REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND PER PRO PROPOSE -- INTEGRATION AND REDUCE CRIME IN THE COMMUNITY I REGION I VOTE WE HAVE SOME WITNESSES SURE RAPPAPORT IS THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING. AND WE HAVE SOMEBODY FROM THE ANTI. RECIDIVISM COALITION OKAY SO TURNED OUT OF MY WITNESSES YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING ASSURING REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT REALLY IS ABOUT USING EXISTING STATE RESOURCES MORE WISELY -- EVIDENCE SHOWS SUPPORT OF HOUSING WHICH IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH INTENSIVE SERVICES -- BREAKS THE LINK BETWEEN INCARCERATION AND AND HOMELESSNESS THE LINK THAT SENATOR BELL DESCRIBES SO WELL -- MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE FUNDED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING -- PEOPLE ON PAROLE OR PROBATION. AND HAVE FOUND THAT IT IMPROVES A FORMALLY CARS RATED INDIVIDUALS CHANCES OF STAYING OUT OF PRISON RECOVERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS AND ACCESSING TREATMENT FOR BOTH MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE. AS ONE EXAMPLE OHIO CREATED AS PART OF HOUSING PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE ON PAROLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BECOME HOMELESS UPON RELEASE FROM PRISON. AND THEY HAVE FOUND. THAT 40% REDUCTION IN THE DAYS SPENT INCARCERATED AND OVER 60% REDUCTION AND RE ARRESTS AMONG -- AYE PARTICIPANTS AS COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IF THEY WERE LIVING IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. SIMILARLY AND NEW YORK PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE CYCLING BETWEEN -- REIKERS ICLOUD ISLAND AND HOMELESS SHELTERS FOUND SUPPORT OF HOUSING NOT ONLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM RATES SIGNIFICANTLY TO STATE AND LOCAL COSTS. AND HEALTH CARE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEMS. PARTICIPANTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO ABUSE SUBSTANCES AND MORE LIKELY TO RECOVER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS IN THIS PROGRAM AGAIN AS COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP. AND DOZENS OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- HAVE FOUND SIMILAR RESULTS. SB TWO EIGHTY TWO WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE THIS EVIDENCE BASED MODEL TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS FOR PEOPLE I'M PRO. IT WILL CONTINUE TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND DO SO IN A WAY THAT -- ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CONTINUE MENTAL TREATMENT AND NOT HAVE A BREAK AND THEIR TREATMENT AS THE CURRENT PROGRAM -- I'VE DOES NOT ALLOW -- EVEN THOUGH THE STATE WILL NO LONGER USE IS MET DOLLARS PAY FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SUPPORT TO NOTE THAT UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM UNDER SB. TWO EIGHTY TWO PEOPLE WOULD STILL BE RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND AGAIN WE DO FEEL LIKE THIS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT BE BETTER US FAR SUPERIOR TO THE TREATMENT THEY'RE RECEIVING NOW. I SECOND THE MOTION -- SB TWO EIGHTY TWO WILL ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH TO REDUCING RECIDIVISM AMONG CALIFORNIANS MOST LIKELY TO RESET OF EIGHT IT WILL NOT ONLY TRANSFORM THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOUSING NEEDS AMONG PEOPLE ON PAROLE BUT REDUCE AND EQUITIES AND OUR SYSTEM IN OUR RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS. I THEREFORE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU THERE'S BEEN A MOTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA SECOND BY OUR VICE CHAIR MISTER DO [inaudible] FOR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILLS TWO EIGHTY TWO MY NAME IS JOHN MCLAUGHLIN I'M THE HOUSING DIRECTOR FOR THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. THEY ARE SEE IS A SUPPORT NETWORK FOR AND COMPRISED OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS DEVOTED TO CHANGING THEIR LIVES BY BECOMING LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AIR SHE CURRENTLY SERVES OVER ONE THOUSAND MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FIVE YEARS AGO WE ASKED OUR MEMBERS WHAT THEY NEEDED MOST WHEN RETURNING HOME. EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING OR AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST. THEY ARE SHE DECIDED OPEN SUPPORT OF HOUSING SITE AND SOME ARE IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN WE STARTED WITH THIRTY TWO BEDS AND SINCE THEN HAVE DOUBLE THAT NUMBER TO SIXTY FOUR WHEN WE OPENED OUR SECOND SIDE LOS ANGELES. SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WERE BUILT INTO OUR HOUSING PROGRAM FROM THE START EACH MEMBER IS ASSIGNED A LIFE COACH WHO PROVIDES CASE MANAGEMENT AND MENTORSHIP. OUR LIFE COACHES ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED PROVIDING LIVED EXPERIENCE FOR PARTICIPANTS. WE ALSO PROVIDE THE LIFE SKILLS WORKSHOPS THAT FOCUS ON FINANCIAL LITERACY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND CAREER READINESS FOR STARTERS. UPON EMPLOYMENT THEY MAINTAIN REGULAR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SAVINGS WITH MINIMUM DEPOSITS BASED ON BUDGETS AND GOALS. THIS IS ALL FOR A FOCUSED EXIT PLAN WHEN THEY LEAVE THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING. OUR HOUSING PARTICIPANTS OFTEN COME TO US EXPRESSING ANXIETY OVER RE ENTERING THEIR COMMUNITIES. AIR SEE SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROGRAM EXISTS TO PROVIDE A SAFE LIVING ENVIRONMENT WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE SOLID SUPPORT SYSTEM. THAT ALLOWS OUR MEMBERS TO FOCUS ON THE REINTEGRATION. OUR LIFE COACHES WALK THEM THROUGH EVERY STEP OF OUR HOUSING PROGRAM IS THE PROVIDE SERVICES TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. THE LOS ANGELES HAVING SAY THE LOS ANGELES HOUSING SERVICES AUTHORITY WHICH TRACK STATISTICS ON OUR OUTCOMES WERE REPORTED THAT DURING TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND MOVED ON TO PERMANENT HOUSING. WITH THE LESS THAN 10% RECIDIVISM RATE AMONGST OUR HOUSING PARTICIPANTS WE BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SUCCESSFUL MODEL. THAT IS WHY A OUR SHE STRONGLY SUPPORTS ON THE BILL TWO EIGHTY TWO A SIMILAR MODEL WITH THE SAME GOAL FOCUSED ON SUPPORT OF HOUSING. HOUSING BASED SERVICES AND WRAPAROUND CARE FOR AN EVEN MORE VULNERABLE POPULATION. INDIVIDUALS ON PAROLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. WE NEED THESE PROGRAMS IN ORDER FOR FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ALREADY FACING COUNTLESS BARRIERS UPON RE ENTRY TO SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE INTO THE COMMUNITIES. REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND INCREASED PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RESPECTFUL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL.

THE TO STATE YOUR STEVEN WEBER OUT WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES -- IT YOUR EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT I WE WILL BE CLEAR THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE INTENT AND SUPPORT THE IDEA OF USING COUNTIES TO DRAW DOWN TO MISTER MOORE. DRIED UP IT'LL DOLLARS MISTER MORE COVERAGE OF HOUSING SUPPORT FOR MENTALLY ILL PAROLEES -- WE ARE CONCERNED HOWEVER ABOUT THE POTENTIAL DISPLACEMENT OF STATE WORKERS WHO CURRENTLY MINISTER THE CURRENT IS MISS PROGRAM. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US TO CRAFT A SOLUTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC WORKERS IN BETTER PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE IN NEED. THANK YOU. I YES -- MY NAME IS JAMES SWEENEY I'M WITH THE ARE BLACK AMERICAN POLITICAL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN A FORMER APPOINTEE OF THE LAST THREE GOVERNOR'S WORKING WITH PEOPLE -- WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- THE IS A MATH PROGRAM. THAT IS A PROGRAM FOR THE SEVERELY CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL. AND IT IS NOT ONLY A QUESTION OF JUST SAYING HOUSING FIRST. THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS. AND THE AVERAGE PER RIDER OF HOUSING WHO HAS NOT DEALT WITH THIS POPULATION. BOB WE BELIEVE THIS POSES A MAJOR PROBLEM. AND WE THINK THAT THE BRIDGE HAS NOT BEEN BUILT TO JUST SAY SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. YOU HAVE TO HAVE VERY VERY STRONG SUPPORT. AND IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE NOTIONS IN THE BILL INDICATES THAT IT. FOLKS SHOULD GET MEDIC COW CERTAIN COUNTIES ARE NOT PROVIDING MEDIC COW FOR THIS POPULATION. AND SO THE IT'S IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AND IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- IN STE IN THOSE COUNTIES WHERE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWING THIS KIND OF FUNDING. IT ALSO REQUIRES A 10% COUNTY MATCH. AND SO WE THINK THAT. ARE WHILE THE END TO IT. OUR IS STRONG AND GOOD AND WE SUPPORT THE INTERNET WE DO NOT SUPPORT THAT. FINALLY -- THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS WHERE THERE ARE MINORITIES AND AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO ARE PLAYING A VERY CRITICAL ROLE IN DEALING WITH THIS POPULATION. AND TO **** THE CONTRACT FROM CDC ARE -- WE THINK IS NOT. THE BEST THING TO DO. SO WE ARE IN EFFECT WE OPPOSE THE LEGISLATION. IF I COULD JUST AS A QUESTION THERE WERE NO LETTERS OF OPPOSITIONSUBMITTED TO THIS COMMITTEE SO ARE YOU YOU ARE POSING THE BILLARE. OKAY ASKED ME AS AS WELL YES OKAY. AND JUST TO CLARIFY WERE LETTERS I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T GET THEM I HAVE ADDITIONAL COPIES HAPPY FOR THE COMMITTEE TO RECEIVE AND WE JUST DIDN'T RECEIVE THEM BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WAS DONE. OKAY LET ME ASK IF THERE OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO POST AVAIL MYSELF. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS A MARVIN ALL THE ON THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR AT ONE OF THE IS THE PROVIDERS. AND I WANTED TO KIND OF POINT OUT THAT THE DATA THAT. SENATE BILL HAS IDENTIFIED WITH THE UCLA STUDY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS ACTUALLY -- CONDUCTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THAT WAS PRIOR TO CDC ARE STREAMLINING THE ECLIPSE -- SERVICES AND IDENTIFYING FIFTEEN DOMAIN AREAS WITH HOUSING BEING ONE OF THEM SO THE UCLA CAME OUT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO CONDUCT THIS STUDY BUT THE DATA WAS NOT PUBLISHED UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ADDITIONALLY -- I LIKE. TO POINT OUT THAT THE THE CORE ISSUE OF THIS BILL IS ABOUT. HOUSING FOR SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS AND THE QUESTION TO THE COMMITTEE IS HOW DO SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS BECOME HOMELESS. IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO A LIFE COACH WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT YOU'LL NEED TO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT WE ARE ONE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH -- IS THE PROVIDERS WE WE PROVIDE BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND HOUSING SERVICES. IN TERMS OF COST -- COST VARIATIONS IT COST ABOUT EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. TO HOUSE A MENTALLY ILL OFFENDER IN THE INSTITUTION SETTING AND THAT THIS MAP SERVICES THAT WE OFFER RIGHT NOW IS FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR A PERSON TO RECEIVE THEIR COMPREHENSIVE CARE AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS DOLLARS A YEAR TO INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH AND HOUSING. BUT THE BILL SAYS THAT IT'S GOING TO PAY UP. TO TWO TO THREE YEARS FOR THEM TO BE HOUSE -- AT MARKET RATES THAT TWO TIMES THE MARKET RATE THE RENT BEING TWO TIMES THE MARKET RATE I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S A COST SAVINGS. FOR THE FOR THE PUBLIC IT IS GOING TO COST AS IN THIS WE RECREATING THE WHEEL SPEND MORE MONEY AND RECREATE THE WHEEL. THE SURGEON GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA HAS IDENTIFIED TRAUMA AS BEING ONE OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF THE HISTORICAL DRAMAS OF GOKULCOMPONENT OF CURRENT ISSUES FOR A FENDER BASS POPULATION HI ACES AND RESILIENCY AS PART OF OUR IDENTIFICATION PROCESS TO IDENTIFY TRAUMA. AND LINK THEM WITH SERVICES AND WITH A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BILL IT DOESN'T IDENTIFY. THOSE INTENSIVE TREATMENT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL POPULATION. YOU CAN JUST PROVIDE THEM WITH HOUSING AND LIFE COACHES TO SAY OKAY THIS IS GOING TO BE THE KEY YOU HAVE A SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL POPULATION WHICH MEANS THAT. THEY NEED COMPREHENSIVE CARE AND HOUSING. SENATE BILL SAID THAT -- TALK ABOUT THAT -- A 100% OF THE FUNDS IS BEING USED TO PAY FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AND OF MEDICINE WE DON'T PAY FOR ANY MEDICINE -- ALL OF THE BILL DOES NOT UTILIZE ANY DOLLARS FOR MEDICINE I AT LEAST IN OUR PROGRAM IN SACRAMENTO AND FRESNO -- WE PAY FULL HOUSING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING -- WE PAY FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE -- WE PAY. FOR LIFE SKILLS AS WELL AS TO BE ABLE TO TEACH THEM SELF SUFFICIENCY SKILL TO BE ABLE TO BE INDEPENDENT SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS BILL PASSES. AND THREE YEARS THEY'VE BEEN HOUSE WHAT'S AFTER THAT HOW TO DIP A PASS ON THE BATON FOR THE THESE POPULATION TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT AND INDEPENDENT. THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE BASIC SKILLS AND THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO. SO WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THAT OPPOSE THE BILL. IF YOU COULD PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE POSING THANK YOU. THERE ARE THOMAS QUALITY FAMILY SERVICES AND AM I'M OPPOSING. IF I MAY MAY I WE'VE ACTUALLY HEARD THREE THREE WITNESSES WE TYPICALLY HAVE TO SO JUST ASK YOU TO JUST STATE THE FACT YOU OPPOSE. AND THAT'S THE PROCESS FAMILY QUALITY SERVICE I OPPOSE. WILLIAM R. BESIDE THEIR FAMILY QUALITY SERVICES ARE POSSIBLE. TAJ UPON GO FAMILY QUALITY SERVICES I OPPOSE. W. LOPEZ FROM QUALITY FAMILY SERVICES I ALSO. HE HAD A NAME FROM QUALITY FAMILY SERVICES AND I OPPOSE. HEY BECAUSE OURS FROM QUALITY FAMILY SERVICES OPPOSE. FOR MONTHS IBERIAN CCS I OPPOSE. I NEED A FERNANDEZ QUALITY FAMILY SERVICES I OPPOSE. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. SENATE APPRECIATE BOTH YOUR LONG TERM COMMITMENT ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE YEARS AS WELL AS THE APPROACH THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING I THINK I'D DEFINITELY SUPPORT -- CHANGING UP THE PARADIGM FROM WHAT IT HAS BEEN WHICH THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE IS NOT -- BEEN WHERE I THINK WE WANT TO BE AND DOESN'T DRAW DOWN ON FEDERAL MATCHES TO MOVE IN IT -- WITHIN EACH CD WHICH I DO THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE AND TO TO TO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS AND TO TO REALLY EXPAND AND AND SHIFT THE PARADIGM OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH SO WITH THAT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WAS SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND ANY FINAL COMMENTS WOULD YOU IF IF IF IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION I THINK THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL -- RECENT CHECKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. INDICATES THAT -- THE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST POSITION -- THERE WERE SEVEN HUNDRED NINETYFOUR POSITIONS BUDGETED [inaudible] AND CURRENTLY ONLY SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE WERE FILLED. SO WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME. ACTUALLY GETTING STAFF WHERE DO WE HAVE A A HUNDRED FORTY SIX VACANCIES WERE. FIND TO RECRUIT PEOPLE. BUT I THINK FOR THIS PROGRAM SO THERE IS AN A THE ISSUE ABOUT. STAFF LOSING THEIR JOBS OR ANY OF THAT KIND OF THERE ISN'T THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE. SO SO -- I THINK THE ISSUE IS THE CONTRACTORS I KNOW THE CONTRACTORS ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO WORK WITH. ANOTHER AGENCY -- AND I HOPE THEY DO BECAUSE THEY HAVE VALUABLE STAFF AND SERVICES THAT CAN BE PROVIDED BUT WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER FINANCING PLAN. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES -- ISSUE POINTED OUT I REGION I VOTE. THANK YOU WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- GOOD MORNING AS I'M SURE YOU ARE AWARE OF IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE VOTERS IN THE CITY OF BRISBANE MADE A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT. TO REGIONAL HOUSING WHEN THEY APPROVED THE MEASURE JJ WHICH WOULD PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED UNITS OF HOUSING ON THE BAY LANCE PROJECT -- LAND IN BRISBANE THIS WOULD MORE THAN DOUBLE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE HOUSING STOCK IN BRISBANE. PASSING MEASURE JJ WAS A WATERSHED MOMENT FOR BRISBANE IN THE STATE. MEASURE JJ REVERSES NEARLY FIFTY YEARS OF VOTES AGAINST DEVELOPMENT OF THE BAY LANDS IT REPRESENTS THE TYPE OF LOCAL LEADERSHIP WE NEED THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA. AND THE STATE IF WE ARE GOING TO PUT A REAL DENT IN THE HOUSING CRISIS. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE REMEDIATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS BRISBANE WILL BE WORKING FOR MANY YEARS IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEVELOPER THE STATE AND REGIONAL AGENCIES. AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO KEEP THIS PROJECT ON TRACK SB SIX SEVENTY TWO ALLOWS BRISBANE TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON GETTING THE BAY LANDS. IN IMPORTANT REGIONAL PROJECT THE BILL DOES THIS BY INSURING CONSISTENCY IN BRISBANE'S REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS OF ALLOCATIONS. DURING THIS PLANNING CYCLE AND THE NEXT. IN RECOGNITION OF THIS COMMITMENT ALREADY MADE. BY THE CITY'S VOTERS TO DOUBLE ITS HOUSING STOCK. SB SIX SEVENTY TWO IS NOT A GIFT.

BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK THE GOOD SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT -- IN QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN CLOSELY WATCHED THROUGHOUT THE BAY. INCLUDING BY MY CONSTITUENTS AND I THINK EVER SINCE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN THE FORMER MAYOR OF BRISBANE. SUGGESTED THAT BRISBANE OUGHT TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT -- BUT SUGGESTED THAT ALL OF THOSE WORKERS COULD LIVE IN MY CITY IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS NOT A COMET THAT WENT OVER PRACTICALLY WELL FOR SAN FRANCISCO -- WERE HAPPY TO SEE THE HOUSING THAT'S BEEN NOW PROPOSED ON THE SITE AND APPRECIATE THE CARROT AND STICK APPROACH IN THIS BILL WITH THAT HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. ALSO SUPPORTED BY A VICE CHAIR ANY FINAL COMMENTS AND RECREATION I VOTED THE APPROPRIATE TIME WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHU CHU I DEEP. DEEP I GABRIEL GLORIA KILEY LEE MON MAIENSCHEIN QUIRK SILVA WILL WAIT FOR EVERYONE TO GET BACK IT'S A BUSY MORNING THANK YOU TO CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES THANK YOU SENATOR. SENATOR DODD. FILE ITEM FOR SB. TWO SEVENTY FOUR THE SELLING THEM BE ALONE [inaudible] I DO. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- FIRST I WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK IN HELPING CRAFT AMENDMENTS FOR THIS BILLS GOT A BROUGHT EVERYBODY TOGETHER. I'LL BE ACCEPTING ALL THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS -- CALIFORNIA HAS A HOUSING CRISIS WE KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE HOUSING. AND WITH THE HIGHEST HOME PRICES IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MOBILE HOMES ARE ONE OF THE FEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS WE HAVE -- THIS BILL HELPS TO KEEP THAT SORT OF HOUSING AFFORDABLE AND HELPS KEEP SENIORS AND DISABLED PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. FIRST THIS BILL CLARIFIES A COMPANION LANGUAGE FROM MY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SB. ONE FOUR SEVEN SB ONE FOUR SEVEN PROVIDED FOR MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS WHO LIVE ALLOWED TO BE ABLE TO DESIGNATE A COMPANION TO LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT A FEAT. SOME PARK OWNERS HAVE INTERPRETED -- THE ONE COMPANION PER YEAR AS OF ONE COMPANION TOTAL PER YEAR THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT A RESUME HAVE ONE COMPANION. AT A TIME UP TO THREE PER CALENDAR YEAR. SECOND OF A MOBILE HOME PARK IS DESTROYED BY WILDFIRE OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTER THIS BILL WOULD OFFER PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS THE FIRST OFFER TO LIVE IN THE PARK IF IT IS REBUILT. AS WE SEE YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON GLOBAL WARMING LEADING TO NUMEROUS CHANGES IN WEATHER PATTERNS NATURAL DISASTERS WILL BECOME EVEN MORE COMMON. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS -- IN MOBILE HOME PARKS AND ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES IF THE PARK MANAGEMENT CHOOSES TO REBUILD. THIRD THIS BILL PROVIDES A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT PARK MANAGEMENT. SHALL CONSIDER WHEN APPROVING OR TONIGHT PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER WHAT THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS CAN PROVIDE THE PARK MANAGEMENT. THE GOALS OF THESE CHANGES ARE HELP AUDIBLE CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE OF AGE DISABILITY INCOME OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF -- FOR WHOM THESE MOBILE HOMES ARE ONE OF THE LAST VESTIGES OF AFFORDABLE OUT HOUSING WOULD BE HERE TODAY TESTIFIED SUPPORTERS PER STAND CORPORATE COUNSEL FOR THE GOLD STATE MANUFACTURED HOME HONESTLY. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HAPPY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY TO REQUEST DRIVE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. IN ADDITION TO CLARIFYING THE SECTION ONE ISSUES THAT THE SENATOR JUST -- CAPABLE REFER -- TO SECTION TO THE BILL IS VERY CRITICAL FOR OUR HOMEOWNER CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE WHERE A PARK IS DESTROYED BY FIRE IN THE RESIDENTS ARE BURNED OUT. THIS WOULD GIVE THEM -- A CHANCE. TO SORT OF REBUILD THEIR OWN LIVES AS THE PARK OWNER IS DOING AND DOING THAT ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME RENTAL TERMS TO START THE TENDENCY I THINK IS IMPORTANT. SO THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME CHANCE THAT THE PARK OWNER HAS -- AND THERE ARE WAYS THAT THE PARK COULD OBVIOUSLY -- RAISE RENTS IF THEY NEEDED TO ONCE THE INITIAL TENNESSEE AND SECTION OCCURS I THINK THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL HAVE NOW CAPABILITY -- PROVIDED FOR THE ISSUES OF INCREASED COSTS FOR THE PARK OWNERS. THE THIRD SECTION IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR ME I'VE ALWAYS CALLED THIS THE BLACK HOLE OF THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LAW -- BECAUSE THIS SECTION TALKS ABOUT THE STANDARDS THE PARK OWNERS TO USE WHEN QUALIFYING PERSPECTIVE PURCHASERS AND IT REFERS TO THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PAY THE RENT OR CHARGES OF THE PARK. BUT THAT PHRASE HAS NEVER BEEN ADEQUATELY DEFINED. AND SO WHAT YOU'VE HAD IN THE INDUSTRY IN MY THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IS THIS INCOME TEST THIS THREE TO ONE INCOME RATIO TEST. THAT A PARK OWNER WILL USE WITHOUT REALLY CONSIDERING ANY OTHER ASSETS -- MANY TIMES OF THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER. WHICH IS. OBVIOUSLY NOT THE WAY IT WOULD WORK IF SOMEBODY WAS APPLYING FOR A FOR A LOAN FOR EXAMPLE. SO ADDING THOSE SPECIFIC OTHER ASSET ISSUES THAT THE PARKER NEEDS TO LOOK AT IS REALLY CRITICAL -- ESPECIALLY IN SENIOR PARKS WHERE YOU HAVE MORE LIMITED -- CAPABILITY TO PURCHASE AND WE KNOW THAT. THE NUMBER OF MOBILE HOME LENDERS IN THE IN THE INDUSTRY IS DECREASING. SO THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT A PARK HONOR CANNOT REGION LEAD HERE TO A SELF CREATED INCOME RATIO ONLY THAT OTHER ASSETS WILL NEED TO BE CONSIDERED -- I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND EXHORT YOU -- TO JOIN ME AND CLOSING THIS BLACK HOLE IN THE MALL PLAN RESIDENCY Là THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING ROGER JOHNSON REPRESENTING GEO SOME WHILE GOLDEN STATE MOBILE HOMEOWNERS LEAGUE.

I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THESE TOUGH ISSUES -- FOR ACCEPTING THE MOMENTS AND ALSO -- FOR WORKING TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE OPPOSITION -- THIS BILL WILL HELP TO CREATE A PATH TO REBUILD MOBILE PARKS AFTER MOBILE HOME PARKS AFTER WILD FIRES. AND OTHER DISASTERS THAT WORK BOTH FOR PARK OWNERS AND HOMEOWNERS AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE WILL HOPEFULLY BE A FAIRER AND MORE TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR SELLING MOBILE HOMES AS WELL. WITH THAT YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT ANY OTHER COMMENTS MR GABRIEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU CENTER FOR THE BILL I JUST -- LOOKING OVER IT -- A LOT OF THIS ROOM MAKES SENSE TO ME AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON IT -- I WAS JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU CAME UP WITH. WITH THE NOTION OF OF THREE COMPANIONS DURING A CALENDAR YEAR I WASN'T HERE OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU -- PASSED -- I GUESS SB ONE FORTY SEVEN ADDITIONALLY BUT JUST CURSED HERE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR THINKING BEHIND THAT. DO YOU WANT. TO IT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS IS. YOUR WILL WE DON'T HAVE VERY OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FORMAL HOUSING SO IN MOBILE HOMES OFTEN THERE'S YELLOW. TO TWO ROOMS AND SOMETIMES THREE ROOMS. ADD -- YOU KNOW THE IDEA WAS IS. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF SENIORS AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE. LIFESPAN WOULD THEY WANT COMPANIONSHIP THAT'S ONE THEY HAVE FRIENDS -- THAT -- PERHAPS -- YELLED CAN'T AFFORD THE RENT ANYMORE WHERE THEY ARE SO IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A A NATURAL THAT THAT -- YEAH WOULD BE DONE AND THAT WAS IT THE ESSENCE OF THE BILL AND THEN THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW THAT WAS THIS KIND OF A CLEAN UP BILL. I DON'T RELEASED SPECIFICALLY -- RECALL WHY THE NUMBER WAS -- THREE TO BE TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO I THINK IT'S JUST THAT IT'S A NUMBER THAT I THINK WOULD REPRESENT A REASONABLE UPPER LIMIT IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. WHERE COMPANIONS ARE CHANGED OUT BY OTHER DEATH THEY'RE MOVING OR ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE ARE OBVIOUS YOU SHOULD BE A LIMIT? BUT BEFORE PARK OWNERS WERE INTERPRETING IT IS SAYING YOU CAN ONLY NAME WINE AND IF THAT PERSON DIES OR LEAVES YOU CANNOT FILL THAT VACANCY UNTIL THE ENTIRE CALENDAR YEAR. ELAPSES. SO SO THE THE THE OTHER THING YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE A LOT MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE THAT IT'S MORE OF A TRANSIT HOUSING OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. I I I I I APPRECIATE -- YOU BRING UP THE POINT THAT WAS EXACTLY IT. SO THIS IS THIS IS. NOT THREE PERSONS AT ONE TIME IT'S NOT LET'S JUST SAY THAT SOMEBODY YOU HAD A SENIOR SAYS THAT MOVED IN WITH SOMEBODY. THAT PERSON DIED. OR THAT PERSON HAD TO MOVE AND MOVE INTO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OR MOVE IN WITH A FAMILY MEMBER SO NOW THIS ROOM IS OPEN AGAIN. IT'S SO THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SAY THAT HAPPENS OF THREE MONTHS THAT WOULD BE NUMBER SOMEBODY ELSE CAME IN THERE THAT'S NUMBER. TWO SIX MONTHS LATER IT HAPPENS AGAIN -- THAT WOULD BE THE TH THE THIRD AND FINAL. ONE OKAY I I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN I IF I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I JUST -- YOU KNOW THE ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES I THINK A LIGHTER TOUCH APPROACH FROM SACRAMENTO MIGHT BE THE BETTER WAY TO GO AND LETTING FOLKS ON THE GROUND WORK OUT SOME OF THESE DETAILS AMONG THEMSELVES -- SO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- AND APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE AND I THINK MOST OF THE TIME. I THINK MOST THE TIME YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS IS OFTEN LAWS ARE ARE MADE BECAUSE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES? YOU DON'T HAVE -- VOTERS FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE FLEXIBLE I APPRECIATE THAT PARK OWNERS THAT ARE HERE THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL -- OFTENTIMES IT'S IT'S THE GOOD ONES THAT -- YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE TO HAVE ISSUES LIKE THIS WITH YEAH WOOD WITH BILLS BY PER SHARE COMMENTS.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THIS IS SB ONE EIGHTY TWO IT IS A BILL. THAT WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE DAMAGE TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES. BY STRENGTHENING LOCAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS. AND BY DIRECTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE RETROFIT STRATEGIES FOR STRUCTURES IN COMMUNITIES IN NEED OF FIRE HARDENING [inaudible] SHE'S ME. BUT BEFORE I CONTINUE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE WITH THIS BILL AND PARTICULARLY ON PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE HOUSING ALLOCATION -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACCEPT IS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THOSE SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE. AND WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR HELPING STRIKE A WORKABLE BALANCE. BETWEEN THE NEED TO REVIEW SOME APPROVALS IN VERY HIGH FIRE AREAS. WITH THE NEED TO MEET REGIONAL HOUSING TARGETS AND I AM CONFIDENT THE SOLUTION WE FOUND PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH APPROPRIATE FLEXIBILITY. WHILE ENSURING REGIONAL GOALS ARE STILL MET. WE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING THE FIRE ISSUE FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. THE ONE THAT. HASN'T BEEN AS ROBUST. DEALS WITH BUILDING IN THE WILL WAY. THE WILDLIFE WILDLAND URBAN. INTERFACE THE WILL WE IS AN AREA WHERE MANY OF US LIVE -- IN MYSELF INCLUDED AND IT IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN IN AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT. LIFE IS PERFECT AND WE DON'T HAVE TO CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE PROBLEMS OF URBAN LIFE. BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT REACH US ALL WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING IN PLACES WHERE MOTHER NATURE. DOES NOT NECESSARILY WANT US TO BE. SO. CALIFORNIA'S PERSISTENT THREAD OF WHILE FAR OF COURSE POSES A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO HOMES AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WHILE MUCH IS BEING DONE TO BETTER MANAGE OUR FORESTS. OF MORE HAS TO BE DONE TO HARDEN EXISTING HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS TO MAKE THEM MORE RESISTANT TO WILDFIRE. AND IMPROVE LAND USE AND INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS TO MINIMIZE WILDFIRE THREATS AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. AT A MARCH THIRTEENTH HEARING FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT IN FIRE PRONE REGIONS THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEES. RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ACTION TO BOLSTER LOCAL PLANNING EFFORTS TO DESIGN MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. TO CONDITION DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS TO ENSURE THAT STRUCTURES AND COMMUNITIES ARE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM FIRE. AND TO ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT OUT OF HARM'S WAY. THAT IS A CHALLENGE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL OCEANS WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS AND BEAUTIFUL HILLS AND PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE THERE. BUT THIS BILL AIMS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT WAS ASKED IN THESE COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND THAT IS TO BE MINDFUL AND THOUGHTFUL WHERE WE DEVELOP [inaudible] NOW CONDITIONS. OF UNDER THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY. ONE EIGHTY TWO CONDITIONS NEW CONSTRUCTION AND IDENTIFIED WILL WE AREAS UPON CITIES AND COUNTIES MEETING INTO A ROOM. AND LATER PERMANENT WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS INCLUDING FOR FIRE RESPONSE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND IGNITION REDUCTION. IT ALSO REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO VERIFY ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH THE FENCIBLE SPACE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND LOCAL FIRE PLANS AND WHILE FIRE HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS WHEN APPLICABLE. IT DIRECTS LOCALS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE RETROFIT STRATEGY FOR STRUCTURES ALREADY VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRE. INCLUDING PROCESSES FOR IDENTIFYING IMPACTED INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS AND MILESTONES FOR COMPLETING RETROFIT WORK AND IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES AND FINANCING STRATEGIES. AND THE BILL DIRECTS THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO UNDERTAKE A NOTICE AND COMMENT RULE MAKING THAT ESTABLISHES. A STATEWIDE WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARD TO ACCOUNT -- FOR CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE WEATHER TYPOGRAPHY AND DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS IN A MORE PRECISE AND REGIONAL WAY. I'M A CHANGES WE KNOW IS CREATING THE POTENTIAL FOR LONGER AND MORE SEVERE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. AND MANY IN THIS ROOM HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED THOSE FIRES -- WHETHER IT WAS. IN SAN DIEGO A FEW YEARS AGO WHETHER IT'S UP IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. IN THE CENTRAL COAST WERE WE EXPERIENCE THE THOMAS FIRES THAT STARTED IN DECEMBER IS OSTENSIBLY DURING THE POST FIRE SEASON. THESE ARE REAL THESE ARE DANGEROUS THESE ARE ONGOING AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM THEM IN THE FUTURE. BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO MITIGATE WE NEED TO DO MORE TO BE PRO ACTIVE. WHEN IT COMES TO IDENTIFYING STE THE SAFEST PLACES TO DEVELOP PARDON THOSE INFRASTRUCTURES THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE FIRE DANGER ZONES? AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SAVE LIVES PROTECT PROPERTY IN COMMUNITY AND MEANINGFULLY REDUCE FUTURE LIABILITY AND WITH THAT I HAVE WITH ME TODAY TRACY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. AND ERIC PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. pTRACY WRI WROTE COUNTY REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIA -- THE AUTHORED DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN OUTLINING WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND SO -- FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY I WILL JUST SAY THAT -- WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE WORKING WITH US -- TO GET THE BILL IN A PLACE WITH THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION HE'S AND REALLY FINDING THAT BALANCE BETWEEN MAKING SURE THAT ARE AT THE COMMUNITIES MOVING FORWARD. ARE SAFE BUT NOT IN ANY WAY EXACERBATING ON THE HOUSING CRISIS -- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS IN HERE THAT -- THE ROLE COUNTIES I THINK ON THE NATURAL WOULD BE CONCERNED WITH HOWEVER WE APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS REALLY KIND OF FOUND THAT BALANCE. IN MAKING SURE THAT -- THAT WAY THAT WE HAVE TIME AS LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- TO TO GET THE RESOURCES TO PUT ALL THE THE PLANNING PIECES IN ORDER -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MOVING FORWARD THOUGH SOME SORT OF LOCAL PLANNING DOLLARS -- BECAUSE OF THE THE EXTENSIVE -- PLANNING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THE BILL -- ALSO WE LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING FORWARD IN WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S ERIC PHILLIPS AND THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. AND WE ALSO ARE HERE TO SUPPORT -- SB ONE EIGHTY TWO THIS MORNING -- WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MEASURES THAT REDUCE THE RISK OF IDENTIFIED -- WILD FIRE HAZARD I'M HOWEVER WE'RE ALSO I AM IN FAVOR OF THE CAREFUL INFERRED INTRODUCTION OF NEW DEVELOPMENT WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DO SO AND PART OF THE REASON THAT WE SUPPORT SB ONE EIGHTY TWO IS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE. BETWEEN THOSE NEEDS -- PARTICULARLY WITH THE EFFORTS AND THAT THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE AUTHOR WERE ABLE TO MAKE WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS PROPOSED HERE TODAY -- WE THINK THAT THE BALANCE AND ONE EIGHTY TWO BETWEEN. HAVING ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS -- AND NEW DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS WHILE ALLOWING DEVELOPMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE IS -- THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT -- REDUCING UNNECESSARY RISK WITHOUT END DO YOU SING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE AS THAT WOULD UNDERMINE STATEWIDE AND REGIONAL HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS. OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE -- IT'S IMPORTANT WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- ARE PROPOSED TODAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT -- ONE EIGHTY TWO WOULD WOULD AND WOULD NOT DO IT WOULD NOT CHANGE THE REGIONAL HOUSINGALLOCATION -- SO EVERY REGION WOOD RIDGE RETAIN ITS OBLIGATION TO FULFILL ITS SHARE OF THE STATE'S HOUSING NEED -- HOWEVER IN INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS WITHIN THOSE REGIONS -- WILD FIRE RISK WOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FACTORS THAT GO INTO A SIGNING THE RENO TO THOSE INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS AND THE BILL IS PROPOSED TO INCLUDE. FACTORS THAT WE FEEL ARE SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO PLANNERS -- WHILE PREVENTING POTENTIAL ABUSES AND UNWARRANTED REDUCTIONS IN RENO -- WHERE THEY THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY NECESSARY TO PROTECT AGAINST -- UNREASONABLE RISK OF WILD FIRE -- DAMAGE AND LOSS OF LIFE -- UNFORTUNATELY IT ALSO ALLOWS REGIONAL EXPERTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT SAFETY -- IT HAS BOTH FORWARD AND BACKWARD LOOKING METRICS AND WE ARE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND ASK THAT YOU DO THE SAME. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. CHAIR MEMBERS REBEKAH LEE ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AS ELECTRIC UTILITY WE HAVE TO DEPLOY THE ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE REGARDLESS WHETHER THE HOUSING IS BUILT AND HI FIRE WRIST AREA ON OR NOT.

LIVING ON SHELTERED OR CYCLING IN AND OUT OF HOSPITALS. AND INCARCERATION IS COSTLY TO THE PUBLIC AND RESULT IN THAT NEEDLESS SUFFERING FOR THE HOMELESS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT LAST FALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED PROPOSITION TWO WHICH IS THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE. WHICH AUTHORIZES THE STATE TO ISSUE TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS TO CREATE TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS. RESEARCH SHOWS SUCH HOUSING KEEPS PEOPLE INSIDE REDUCES ILLNESS AND SUFFERING AND ULTIMATELY LOWERS PUBLIC COSTS SB SEVENTY SIX SEVEN FORTY FOUR HELPS FULFILL THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS BY CLARIFYING AND STREAMLINING THE LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS. FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES LIKE THOSE AT NO PLACE LIKE HOME BONDS ARE FINDING. IT UTILIZES THE STREAMLINING APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECTSINVASION IN LAST YEAR'S AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO AND APPLIES THIS PROCESS TO THE PROPOSITION TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. SUFFERING WITH THE MOUNT MENTAL ILLNESSES. THE BILL EXPANDS ADDITION DEFINITION OF SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND INCLUDES THAT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING MAY BE USED BY RIGHT INTONES WERE MULTI FAMILY IN MIXED USE ARE PERMITTED.

THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA'S UNDER ON SHELTER THE HOMELESS POPULATION IS CHRONICALLY HOMELESS MEANING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HOMELESS FOR A YEAR OR MORE OR HAVE EXPERIENCED AT LEAST FOUR EPISODES OF HOMELESSNESS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS POPULATION IS LIVING WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. WE KNOW THAT THE LONGER A PERSON EXPERIENCES HOMELESSNESS THE CHANCES OF DEVELOPING A SERIOUS MENTAL DISORDER US OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY. ETCETERA CABALLERO HAS ALREADY SAID SB SEVEN FOUR FOUR WILL HELP DELIVER THE VOTERS DESIRED MANDATE TO BUILD THESE TWENTY THOUSAND AS A PART OF HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA.

OUT BALLOTS WHEN THE OUTCOME WILL BE THE SAME. IT WOULD BE EASIER AND LESS COSTLY TO RULE THAT THE SLATE ONE BY ACCLAMATION. COLLEAGUES I HAVE THREE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS IN A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY THAT SPENDING TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ELECTION FOR THREE HOMERS ASSOCIATIONS. WITH TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UNITS EACH YEAR. SB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW AN UNCONTESTED SLATE TO WIN BY ACCLAMATION AT THE END OF A NOTICE FILING PERIOD THE SAVING RETIREES.

THEIR GREAT FRIEND IN THEIR PET. AND THEY ARE NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER ANY WEATHER CONDITIONS. GO WITHIN TO A SHELTER WITHOUT THEIR MOST IMPORTANT LOVE. ONE END OF ISSUE. SO AS WE DEVELOP PUBLIC POLICY. TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET GIVEN SHELTER AND SERVICES AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS. WE HAVE TO DO WITH THE CORE. TAKE CARE OF THEIR PETS. DID OF ISSUE. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S ONLY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IT SHOULD BE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. WHY BECAUSE IT'S THE CHEAPEST MONEY WITH THE GREATEST IMPACT FOR FOLKS AND FOR THEIR PETS? THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL THE GOVERNOR TALKS ABOUT PETS IN IS HOUSING BILL THAT WE PASSED THIRTY NINE ZERO OFF THE SENATE FLOOR. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IT SHORTLY WE THINK IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT PRETTY SIMPLE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WE HAVE A SUPPORTERS HERE TO SPEAK YES GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M JENNIFER APPEARING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE BEST FRIENDS ANIMAL SOCIETY TO SAN DIEGO HUMANE SOCIETY AND THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA AND WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. FOR INCLUDING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE RECENTLY ENACTED BUDGET. TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS LOCAL EFFORTS TO AID PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ALONG WITH THEIR PETS THIS FUNDING IS ALIGNED WITH A SLEDGE WITH THIS BILL THE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING COMMITTEE OF ELEMENT TO DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER PROGRAMS THAT AWARD GRANTS TO QUALIFIED AGENCIES PROVIDING HOUSING. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ALONG WITH THEIR PETS IN SAN DIEGO AT LEAST NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS EVERY NIGHT OF THOSE NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN LIE DOWN TO SLEEP EACH NIGHT. INSIDE ON SIDEWALKS IN DOORWAYS CANYONS IN ALLEYS SOME CHOOSE TO LIVE IN THEIR CAR FOR LACK OF PET FRIENDLY OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH PETS HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT THEIR COMPANION ANIMALS ARE ALL THEY HAVE AND GIVE THEM A PURPOSE AND REASON TO LIVE. IN SAN FRANCISCO HOMELESSNESS IS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES WERE FACING HOW TO PROVIDE VETERINARY CARE FOR THE PETS OF THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IS A PROBLEM FOR MANY ORGANIZATIONS. THIS PROGRAM IN THE STATE FUNDING WILL HELP MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PROVIDE LIFESAVING SERVICES TO THOSE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE GO WITHOUT. AND FINALLY HERE IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO OUR FRONT ST SHELTER INVESTED LOCAL GENERAL FUND GRANTS AND FUND RAISING IN PHARMACEUTICALS CRATES FOOD LEASHES AND EVEN SOME BEHAVIOR TRAINING FOR THE TRIAGE SHELTER IN NORTH SACRAMENTO. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO BOTH CARE FOR THE ANIMAL IN THE MOMENT AND TO PREPARE THEM TO BE THE KINDS OF COMPANION TO DO NOT POSE A BARRIER TO OTHER HOUSING OPTIONS. FOR EVER GOING TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS WE MUST ADDRESS THE ANIMAL COMPONENT I DR -- AND I THINK SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR LOOKING OUT FOR BOTH ENDS OF THE LEASH [inaudible] NEXT. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO FIFTY EIGHT MY NAME IS ENTERED HER THINK I'M A PROGRAM ANALYST IN THE OFFICE UPON THE SERVICES FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO BRING SERVICES AND HOUSING TO THOSE MOST IN NEED AND TO ADDRESS THE COMMUNITY IMPACTS OF ON SHELTER HOMELESSNESS. WE RECENTLY OPERATED A LOW BARRIER TRIAGE SHELTER THAT ALLOWED INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND WHO WISH TO REMAIN WITH THEIR PAT TO ACCESS SHELTER AND ENGAGE IN SERVICES. THIS APPROACH FOLLOWS A NATIONWIDE BEST PRACTICE AND PROVED SUCCESSFUL FOR THE CITY AND MANY OF OUR ON HOME TO RESIDENTS A GOOD NUMBER OF WHOM ENTERED THE SHELTER AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF BEING DISCONNECTED FROM OKLAHOMA SERVICES. IN IT SIXTEEN MONTHS OF OPERATIONS THIS LOW BARRIER SHELTER SERVE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT INDIVIDUALS AND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO PATS. AT ANY GIVEN TIME NEARLY 25% OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. WERE SHELTERED WITH THEIR PETS AND SUCCESSFULLY COHABITATING WITH PARTICIPANTS WITHOUT PETS DEMONSTRATING THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO OPERATE SUCH A PROGRAM WE OFFERED ANIMAL SERVICES LIKE MEDICAL CARE LICENSING VACCINATIONS. AND NEUTERING AND SPAIN SERVICES TO PETS IN THE SHELTER BUT ALSO SUPPORTED PET OWNERS IN MAKING THE TRANSITION FROM LIVING ON SHELTERED. TO LIVING IN A CONGREGATE FACILITY. THE SOFT SKILLS PROVED VALUABLE AS MANY OF THESE ALL THE PARTICIPANTS MOVED ON TO BEING HOUSED WITH THEIR DOG OR CAT. ANIMAL CARE SERVICES AT THE SHELTER WERE PROVIDED BY THE CITY SPONSORED ANIMAL SHELTER WHICH ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PET OWNERS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUT OF THEIR HEADQUARTERS. NEAR OLD SACRAMENTO. AND THEIR STAFF CONTINUE TO SEE THE EVERY DAY NEED FOR ANIMAL CARE SERVICES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES ON HOME RESIDENTS. BY PROVIDING ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PETS WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE WERE NOT CONNECTING TO WRAP AROUND SERVICES INCLUDING RE HOUSING FOCUSED SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE CITY'S SHELTER AND THE SUCCESS OF SIMILAR PROGRAMS FUNDED BY OUR PARTNERS AT THE COUNTY. THE CITY CONTINUES TO PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL SHELTERS WHICH WILL ACCOMMODATE -- FOLKS WITH THEIR PETS. THE PROGRAM CREATED BY SB TWO FIFTY EIGHT WITH EDUCATED FUNDING COULD ALLOW THE CITY AND OTHERS TO CONTINUE PROVIDING CRITICAL SERVICES FOR PETS AND HELP US BOTH GET PEOPLE AND PETS OFF THE STREETS. AND INTO HOUSING AND SERVICES AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE. THANK YOU I WILL DRAG OUT MY WONDERFUL LITTLE PERIOD HERE JUST TO GET THIS -- SUPPORT AND THEN HAND THE GAVEL OVER. OTHERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU KIANA VALENTINE ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PLEASE BE HERE IN SUPPORT. DEVIN ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF MARS PET CARE AND SUPPORT.

AGO. COMMITTEE GOT IT [inaudible] OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE MR GABLE. FIGURE -- THINK IT'S A REALLY SMART IDEA ASKREDDIT IS CO AUTHOR BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU. THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY THAT'S JUST AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING AS OPPOSED TO SEVEN INTO OUR ROLE ISSUE -- ANY EIGHTY UP -- MISTER QUIRK SILVA. I'LL MAKE A FEW COMMENTS -- IT WAS A QUICK PRESENTATION AND AS READY JUST. TO GO OF FROM THE MOTION. TO A SECOND WHICH I AGREE WITH BUT I DO HAVE TO MAKE COMMENTS BECAUSE A FEW TIMES WERE REALLY WILL RUSH WE SAY THINGS LIKE -- IT'S WHICH YOU'VE GOT SUPPORT SUPPORT OR OF LET'S JUST MOVE THROUGH THE BUT THIS IS A REALLY POWERFUL BILL -- AND IT MEANS SO MUCH. ONE OF THE THINGS IF YOU HAVE ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE WHO. ARE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND I AND I LIKE TO SAY EXPERIENCING BECAUSE HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FOREVER. BUT YOU WILL NOTE THAT EXACTLY AS YOUR BILL SAYS THEY ARE MORE WILLING TO DEFER HOUSING IN ORDER TO STAY. WITH THAT PAT AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT EMOTIONALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY. THEY HAVE AN ATTACHMENT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED. I'VE RID OF RESEARCH QUITE A BIT AND ONE OF THE PIECES OF DATA SHOWED THE SUGGEST. OF HOW MANY ACTUALLY MONTHS AND EVEN YEARS A HOMELESS A PERSON CAN GO WITHOUT HAVING ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TOUCH OR HUG FOR SOMEBODY LOOKING AT THEM AND ASKING THEM THEIR NAME OR AND SO FORTH. AND SO THEY DO GET VERY ATTACHED HAVE A MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON OUR STREETS BUT ALSO IN OUR PRISONS ALSO FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND HOSPITALS WE KNOW THAT IN FOR ANY OF US WHO ARE A PET OWNER WE KNOW. WHAT A LOSSES WE HAD TO PUT OUR -- GOLDEN RETRIEVER DOWN JUST ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR AND IT IS A HUGE LOSS. BUT I WILL JUST SHOW IT WAS CHAIR OR AND MY SHARING A PERSONAL STORY WHICH IS SOME OF YOU KNOW THAT MY BROTHER -- WHO WAS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS -- PASSED AWAY OR DIED -- IN OCTOBER AND ONE THE LAST THINGS THAT HE DID THAT HAD A BIG IMPACT ON OUR FAMILY IS A HE WAS OUT AT NIGHT AND SOMEBODY THREW A LITTLE KITTEN OUT OF A CAR.

MISINFORMATION AND THE COMMUNITY JUST TO MAKE CRYSTAL CLEAR -- THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE LOCAL ZONING -- HEIGHTS OR SET BACKS OR DESIGN STANDARDS -- DE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY OCT FUNDAMENTALLY. IS ABOUT REQUIRING COMMUNITIES TO COMPLY WITH THEIR OWN RULES THAT WHEN THEY ADOPT RULES AROUND ZONING -- HEIZER NUMBER OF UNITS OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE -- THAT THEY NEED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR OWN. RULES. SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY TWO CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW IN THE THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- THIS IS NOT A NEW LAW THIS IS A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD LAW THAT I WAS WITH PASS WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD -- AND THIS CLARIFIES SEVERAL ASPECTS AND STRENGTHENS SEVERAL EXISTING PROVISIONS TO ENSURE THE NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS PROTECTED AGAINST. PRIVILEGED TO PERMIT THIS APPROVALS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- WAS -- STRENGTHENED A FEW YEARS AGO AS WELL AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SAID HOUSING LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT SERVES AS A PRIMARY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM -- TO PROTECT AGAINST INAPPROPRIATE PROJECT IS APPROVALS WINDOWS DISAPPROVAL WHEN AS PROJECTS COMPLY WITH LOCAL STANDARDS. I'M THE ACT HAS SEVERAL AMBIGUITIES THAT HAVE ARISEN -- BECOME A PARENT A RECENT YEARS -- AND THIS BILL WILL CLARIFY THOSE AMBIGUITIES -- OF SICK OF NOTE THE BILL CLARIFIES THE DEFINITIONS OF QUOTE UNQUOTE LOWER DENSITY AND QUORUM COURT REDUCTION IN DENSITY -- TO MAKE CLEAR OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT APPLIES TO ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS -- AND ALSO -- TO ADDING BEDROOMS AND EXISTING HOMES -- CLARIFIES THAT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT ALSO APPLIES TO MINISTERIAL HOUSING APPROVALS -- AND EVELYN ENHANCE THE ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL REMEDIES OFFER BAD FAITH -- DISAPPROVAL OF PROJECTS WERE WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL TO APPROVE THE PROJECT.

ANYONE ELSE OF GOOD FOR THE YEAH COULD MORNING MISTER VICE CHAIR -- MY NAME IS PATRICK OFF ON WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB. FIVE NINE TWO AND PRIMARILY BECAUSE SB FIVE NINE TWO WE BELIEVE WILL CONTINUE TO HELP AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT IT CLOSES LOOPHOLES IN THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT THAT -- DO NOT SPECIFY WHETHER MINISTERIO APPROVALS ARE COVERED OR NOT AND DESK PROVIDES THAT CRITICAL CLARITY. MOST OF THE MOST OF THE MINISTERIAL APPROVAL TO HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN CALIFORNIA UNDER SB THIRTY FIVE HAVE BEEN 4100% AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS -- AND THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT THOSE DEVELOPMENTS GAP BUILD WITHOUT DELAY -- AND SO -- AND AND PEACH HAS ALSO HISTORICALLY BEING SUPPORTIVE OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND WE CONTINUE TO WE BELIEVE THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO PROTECT THOSE UNITS AS WELL. AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER SECOND HALF CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE ARE SPONSOR OF THE BILL -- SPECIFICALLY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT -- THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS TO HELP HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD EIGHTY USING THEIR TONIGHT BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EVEN IF THEY'RE CONCERT ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH PLANNING AND ZONING IN DESIGN. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE A PROPERTY OWNERS THE ABILITY MADE HOLE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES THE WRONG THING WE'RE HOPING THE HOMEOWNERS WON'T HAVE TO USE THE HA IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE REACHED A THEIR TO USE. BUT THIS WILL HOPEFULLY MOVE US FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD FOR COMPLETING THE THE EIGHTY YOU GOALS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE.

MOST OF OUR CONCERNS AM I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED TO THIS BILL -- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EFFORT IN THE MOVEMENT WE'VE SEEN THERE ARE JUST A FEW. KEY ISSUES THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE WE CAN REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AND THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IS INTENDED TO YOU -- LIMIT THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO YOU TONIGHT OR REDUCE THE DENSITY OF PROJECTS THAT DISCRETION DOES NOT COME INTO PLAY FOR MINISTERIAL APPROVAL SO THE INCORPORATION. OF MINISTERIAL PERMITS THROUGHOUT THE H. A. -- CREATES IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS WITH THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AND WE THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY TO YOU. M. INCREASE THE ACCOUNTABILITY ASPECT IN BY INCORPORATING REMEDIES UNDER TEN EIGHTY FIVE ACTIONS FOR MINISTERIAL PERMIT ENFORCEMENT -- THROUGH THE HA A AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING THAT WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE BECAUSE WE THINK -- THAT THAT CAN. HELP ADDRESS THIS THIS REAL CONCERN ON THE OTHER SUBSTANTIVE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL IS THE IDEA OF COMPENSATORY DAMAGES BEING ENFORCED AGAINST -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT. VIOLATE THE HA A THE HJ ALREADY HAS A VERY STEEP FINANCIAL PENALTIES INCORPORATED AND IT. AND M. THE ADDITION OF COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AGAINST A POTENTIAL THAT. EITHER DEVELOPERS POTENTIAL FUTURE RESIDENTS COULD EXPOSE I'M LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALMOST UNLIMITED -- UNLIMITED LIABILITY AND AND THAT IS A SERIOUS CONCERN AND AND SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU PLEASE OF HI I'M PETER PAPADOPOULOS AND I'M WITH THE MISSION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THE MISSION DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND WE ARE A MUNITY BASED COMMUNITY SERVING ORGANIZATION WE SURVIVE ROUGHLY SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED MOSTLY LOW INCOME LATINO FAMILIES A YEAR. IN THE AREAS OF SOCIAL SERVICES ASSET BUILDING AND WE ARE ALSO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER -- WE APPRECIATE THAT STEPS SEEM TO BE TAKEN TODAY TO MAKE SOME AMENDMENTS TO SOME OF THE AREAS. THAT WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT AND I THINK THAT I WILL NEED TO STUDY THAT THIS IS OF COURSE A NEW BILL TO US AS A AS IT MOVED INTO ANOTHER BILL. AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT THESE NEW AMENDMENTS ARE THEY SEEM TO MAKE AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THAT. CLARIFIED SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ABOUT DISCRETION WE STILL DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT DISCRETION IN THIS BILL AND HOW IT INTERSECTS WITH MINISTERIAL ISSUES AGAIN -- WERE UNCLEAR ABOUT DID -- IN WHAT WAYS MIGHT IT TAKE AWAY. AREAS OF MINISTERIAL APPROVALS WHERE THERE IS IN FACT CURRENTLY A MECHANISM FOR A COMMUNITY MEMBER WITHIN OF ALL THEIR BOOK COMMUNITY. TO HAVE AN A COURSE OF ACTION. IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE MAINTAINING. THEIR CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM WITHIN A SO. THE MAIN THING THAT WE WE WOULD STRESS AS WE'D LIKE TO SEE THESE CHANGES CONTINUE WE STUFF OTHER POTENTIAL CONCERNS BECAUSE WILL REALLY WANTING TO MOVE THIS THAT HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. AND ALL OF THE STATE HOUSING BILLS FROM WHERE THEY ARE NOW WHICH IS A SORT OF START AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. MARKET SOLUTIONS BASED APPROACH AND THEN WE CHASE WITH MITIGATION ELEMENTS AND WE'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE. A SHIFT TO A PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE STARTING WITH AN OVERALL EQUITY BASED FRAMEWORK RIGHT SO WE'RE STARTING BY SAYING WE KNOW WE NEED DEVELOPMENT WE NEED EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT AS WE BUILD OUT OUR STAY AS WE BUILD THE HOUSING WE NEED DURING THIS CRISIS. HOW DO WE START WITH A FILTER THAT SAYS? WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE THOUGHT OF AND THAT THEY'RE IN A ABLE TO TO THRIVE AND TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AS A STARTING POINT RIGHT THERE. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT IT COULD PUT SOME -- COST ON TO NEIGHBORHOODS -- WITH SOME ELEMENTS AGAIN BOTH THROUGH THE LITIGATION ASPECTS OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS DOES THE MINISTERIAL IN OTHER KINDA SHIFTS. ARE ALL ELEMENTS OF DISCRETION OFF THE TABLE WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE BECAUSE AGAIN THAT WILL MOVE COSTS ON TO ALREADY OVERBURDENED VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.
