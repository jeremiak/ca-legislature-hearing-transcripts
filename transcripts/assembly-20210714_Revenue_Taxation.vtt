BURBANK AND GLENDALE AND

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.579
SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. I HAVE

THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ON

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:31.819
THE BELOW THE LINE. AND I THINK

01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:32.787
WHAT WE'RE CREATING AT THIS

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.489
MOMENT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:36.190
REAL SHIFT. IN WHICH PUBLIC

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:38.192
DOLLARS ARE USED TO ENSURE.

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:39.794
THAT BOTH BELOW THE LINE AND

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:40.995
ABOVE THE LINE WORKERS ARE

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:42.697
REFLECTIVE OF THE STATE. I WANT

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:44.832
TO APPLAUD. THE BUILDING TRADES

01:26:44.899 --> 01:26:47.101
SPECIALLY MISTER. RON MILLER

01:26:47.168 --> 01:26:47.936

COMMITMENT TO LABOR IN HIS

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:54.909
RETIREMENT. IN AUGUST BUT THE

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:55.877
TRADES HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE

01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:58.146
JOB. IN CREATING THE PLATFORM

01:26:58.212 --> 01:27:00.915
IN WHICH THEY ARE ABLE TO- HAVE

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:03.618
DATA RELATED TO GENDER TO RACE

01:27:03.685 --> 01:27:05.420
ETHNICITY FOR THEIR WORK FORCE.

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:06.888
WHICH HAS ENABLED THEM TO

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:09.157
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT.

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:10.758
ALL THE COMMUNITIES AND

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:11.392
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.194
THEY SERVE. WE GET TO SHIFT

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:15.263
THAT NOW IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:17.198
OF LABOR TO ENSURE THAT.

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:19.667
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS EXPAND.

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:20.702
TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:21.703
AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:23.404
PIECES. IS ACTUALLY ENSURING

01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:24.539
THAT THE FILM TAX COMMISSION

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:26.541
BEGINS TO COLLECT THE DATA. IN

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:28.343
HEARINGS THAT I HAD AND SO FOR.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:30.111
WE WERE OFTEN TOLD THAT THE

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:31.779
FILM COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.681
THE AUTHORITY TO CREATE DATA.

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:34.749
TO COLLECT THE DATA WE'RE

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.618
SHIFTING THAT TO ENSURE THAT.

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:38.586
ANY PRODUCTION MOVING FORWARD

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:39.387
IN THE SOUND STAGES THAT ARE

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:40.788
BEING NEWLY CREATED. THE

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:41.923
PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE THE

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:43.291
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:44.892
WORKFORCE PLAN THAT IS DIVERSE

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:47.128
THAT IS EQUITABLE. THAT BEGINS

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:48.763
TO OPEN UP AVENUES IN WHICH-

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.431
REALLY THE WORK FORCE BOTH

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:52.200
BELOW AND ABOVE THE LINE LOOKS

01:27:52.266 --> 01:27:53.534
LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:54.469
AND I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:56.437
IMPORTANT- NOT JUST TALKING

01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:58.506
ABOUT HOW. HOW WE GET TO DO

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:02.110
THAT. AND CHANGING HAS TAX LIKE

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:02.910
OSCARS SO WHITE. BUT HOW WE

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:05.279
ACTUALLY CREATE A PATHWAY. IN

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:07.181
WHICH THAT ACTUALLY GETS TO

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:08.082
HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT'S

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.951
EXCITING IT'S INNOVATIVE IT'S

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:11.786
NEW. AND WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:13.454

DOWNTURN THAT WE FINALLY. MAYBE

APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT. SO IF

01:34:57.058 --> 01:34:58.325
WE'VE LEARNED A LESSON FROM

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:01.228
THAT- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:03.831
LARGEST. BUDGET THAT WE VOTED

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:05.800

ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THAT WAS

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:14.442
LESS THAN. LESS THAN HALF OF

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:34.028
FURROWS THAT WE DEAL WITH SO

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:34.995
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE PEAK

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:36.464
RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD BE

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:38.732
EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO MAKE THE

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:40.568

SIX TIMES THE INVESTMENT AND

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:04.525

SUCCESSFUL TAX CREDIT WE NOT

BIRTHDAY. SO THAT HE COULD WORK

01:36:41.162 --> 01:36:43.097
BECAUSE OTHER STATES HAVE

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:43.697
PULLED THEM BUSINESS AWAY FROM

TAX CREDITS AS WELL. I THINK IT

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:31.245
YEARS ON THIS ISSUE- A FURTHER

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:33.881
REASONS- THAT THEY STATED- AND

01:37:33.948 --> 01:37:35.216
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT

01:37:35.282 --> 01:37:37.017
ON ON THE BIG PICTURE TAX

01:37:37.084 --> 01:37:38.819
INCENTIVE. ISSUE OF THERE'S

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:39.620
ONLY THREE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.522
THE BUCKET YOU CAN PUT MORE IN

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:42.890
IT YOU CAN TAKE MORE OUT OF IT

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:43.457
OR YOU CAN CREATE A BIGGER

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:45.292
BUCKET AND CLEARLY THE

01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:47.194
INVESTMENTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:37:47.261 --> 01:37:48.896
ABOUT WE NEED TO DO MORE OF-

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:49.997
WHEN WE DO NEED TO HAVE A BIG

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:52.299
PICTURE A VIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:53.267
ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN

01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:56.503
CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM SUCCESS-

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.205
AND YOU KNOW SIGNED ME UP FOR

01:37:58.272 --> 01:37:59.540
THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:00.341
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:02.710
CRITICAL- AND IT'S LONG BEEN A

01:38:02.776 --> 01:38:05.613
FRUSTRATION. IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:07.348
IS THAT THE WAY WE'VE LOOKED AT

01:38:07.414 --> 01:38:09.416
TAX INCENTIVES WE ALWAYS LOOK

01:38:09.483 --> 01:38:11.485
AT THEM AS AN EXPENDITURE NOT

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:12.653
AS THE INVESTMENT THAT THEY'RE

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.688
INTENDED TO BE ONE THING WE CAN

01:38:14.755 --> 01:38:16.323
ALSO LOOK IN IS HOW WE HOW WE

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:18.592
BUDGET YOU KNOW CAN WE USE THE

01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:21.295
PROJECTIVE INCOME. AS A AS A

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:22.663
DEDICATED REVENUE STREAM YOU

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:23.831
KNOW WE SHOULD LOOK AT THOSE

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:25.599
THOSE ISSUES SO I THINK THOSE

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:27.301
ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT POINTS

01:38:27.368 --> 01:38:28.936
THAT- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:30.271
MULTIPLE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAVE

01:38:30.337 --> 01:38:32.439
BATES SELF- CERTAINLY WANT TO

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:34.141
GIVE THAT CONVERSATION IF IT'S

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:35.876
DUE THE OTHER PIECE THAT'S

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:36.777
EXCITING ABOUT THE

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:38.946
ENTERTAINMENT TAX CREDIT IS THE

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.648
ACCOUNTABILITY YOU ACTUALLY

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:42.616
HAVE TO CREATE THE JOBS YEAH

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:44.985
ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THE WORK

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:46.987
OFTENTIMES- IN THE EARLY TWO

01:38:47.054 --> 01:38:48.656
THOUSANDS BEFORE WE HAD PROP

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:50.724
TWENTY FIVE. TAX CREDITS WERE

01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:53.227
USED AS A VEHICLE TO CLOSE TO

01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:55.396
GET VOTES TO CLOSE THE BUDGET

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:56.797
DISCUSSIONS AND THERE IS VERY

01:38:56.864 --> 01:38:57.898
LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT

01:38:57.965 --> 01:38:59.867
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE- FOLLOW

01:38:59.933 --> 01:39:00.934
UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:02.703
IN TE JOBS THAT WERE INTENDED

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:04.038
TO BE CREATED WERE ACTUALLY

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:06.106
CREATED AND THAT GAVE THE TAX

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:07.808
INCENTIVES HISTORICALLY A BAD

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:09.109
NAME BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:11.278
ACCOUNTABILITY THIS PARTICULAR

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:15.282
TAX CREDIT- FOOT THAT AND

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:15.883
BROUGHT THE ACCOUNT ABILITY.

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:18.085
THE JUDGE CREATION THE RECORD

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:19.553
HAD TO BE THERE IN ORDER FOR

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.221
THE MONEY TO BE DISHED OUT AND

01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:22.323
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AN

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:23.957
APPROACH THAT AS WE LOOK AT TAX

01:39:24.024 --> 01:39:25.826
POLICY WE SHOULD LOOK AT. THAT

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:27.161
THAT APPROACH TO MAKING SURE

01:39:27.227 --> 01:39:28.495
THAT THE JOBS ACTUALLY GET

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:29.196
CREATED THE ECONOMIC

01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:31.598
DEVELOPMENT- ACTUALLY. ACTUALLY

01:39:31.665 --> 01:39:34.368
HAPPENS AND SO. I THINK THAT AS

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:36.904
IS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S ALSO.

01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.005
ANOTHER PIECE OF WHY THIS IS

01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:40.607
ALSO. A SIGNIFICANT IS THE SAME

01:39:40.674 --> 01:39:42.509
COLD FIRM. FOR THE INCENTIVES

01:39:42.576 --> 01:39:43.744
ON DIVERSITY IN ORDER TO GET

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:46.380
THE ACTUAL DOLLARS. YOU HAVE TO

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:48.716
HAVE THOSE DIVERSITY PLANTS-

01:39:48.782 --> 01:39:49.817
AND SO I THINK THAT'S A

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.185
CRITICAL COMPONENT WHERE

01:39:51.251 --> 01:39:54.254
THERE'S A IMBEDDED INTO THIS.

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:55.656
THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT ARE.

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:57.791
TAXPAYERS WANT. AND THE JOB
