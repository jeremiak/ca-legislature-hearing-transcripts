AND SO I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:53.698
SALES TAX I REPRESENTED THE

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.366
SITUATION NUMEROUS SMALL

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:57.835
BUSINESSES WHO SELL AN ONLINE

FEW MONTHS AS A CD TFA.

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.043
TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB BUT THEY

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.344
HAVE LET'S JUST BE HONEST

00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:08.779
THEY'VE BEEN THREATENING A LOT

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.147
OF THESE MOM AND POP OPERATORS

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:11.449
WITH TAXES INTEREST AND

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:12.817
PENALTIES.

00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:13.451

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:15.920
CASES.

00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:16.921
AND THIS IS IN THE MARKET PLACE

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:20.191
ON HAITIAN WHERE YOU HAVE AS AN

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:22.760
EXAMPLE AMAZON FBA SELLERS.

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:24.028
IN THEIR THREE POINTS I WANT TO

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:26.530
MAKE LEGALLY AND AND ONE IS THAT.

00:39:26.597 --> 00:39:28.933
WHILE THE PROBLEM IS ADDRESS ON

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:30.568
A PROSPECTIVE BASIS IT'S NOT A

00:39:30.634 --> 00:39:31.702
IT'S NOT ADDRESS ON A GOING

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:32.870
BACKWARDS BASIS.

00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:35.906
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.842
LEGISLATION.

00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:38.476
AB SOME CLARIFYING LANGUAGE I

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:39.477
THINK COULD BE APPROPRIATE HERE

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.045
BECAUSE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:42.913
WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.249
AT LEAST SEVENTY TO EIGHTY YEARS.

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:47.918
REGULATION FIFTEEN SIXTEEN I'D

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:49.220
BEEN ON THE BOOKS ALL THIS TIME

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:50.888
SAYS THAT AND I QUOTE A PERSON

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:52.423
WHO HAS POSSESSION OF PROPERTY

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.058
OWNED BY ANOTHER.

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:55.593
AND ALSO THE POWER TO CALL ITS

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:56.127
TITLE TO BE TRANSFERRED BY

00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:57.094
ANOTHER.

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:59.363
THAT PERSON IS DEEMED TO BE THE

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.298
RETAILER RIGHT SO WE HAVE THIS

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:02.133
BEING TAKEN CARE OF ON A

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:04.068
PROSPECTIVE BASIS IT WOULD BE

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:05.770
USEFUL WE HAVE LANGUAGE. TO TAKE

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:06.537
CARE OF IT ON A GOING BACKWARDS

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:08.072
BASIS IN CONFORMITY WITH

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:09.273
EXISTING LAW WE ALSO HAVE A

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.642
STATUTE SIX THOUSAND AND SEVEN

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.110
WHICH ESSENTIALLY SAYS THE SAME

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:14.011
THING.

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:14.945
AND THEN THE THIRD AND FINAL

00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:16.113
POINT I WANNA MAKE FROM A LEGAL

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.915
PERSPECTIVE IS WE KNOW THAT

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:19.250
THERE ARE CONTRACTS BETWEEN

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:21.719
ONLINE MARKETPLACE FACILITATORS.

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:24.388
AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:25.956
SOMETIMES THOSE CONTRACTS SAY --

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.725
THE SMALL BUSINESS AGREES TO BE

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:28.259
THE RETAILER FOR SALES TAX

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:30.528
PURPOSES WELL UNDER CALIFORNIA

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.963
LAW YOU CANNOT CONTRACT AWAY.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.866
YOUR DUTIES AS A RETAILER.

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:37.067
BY VIRTUE OF SIGNING A PIECE OF

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:37.902
PAPER WITH SOMEBODY ELSE

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:39.737
OBVIOUSLY.

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:41.105
THAT WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:42.439
LOT OF OTHER PROBLEMS WE CAN

00:40:42.506 --> 00:40:44.708
JUST CREATE AN OFFSHORE COMPANY.

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:45.509
HAVE A CONTRACT WITH AFTER

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.677
COMPANIES MAKE THAT OFFSHORE

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:48.946
COMPANY THE RETAILER AND OBVIATE

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:51.081
AND RELIEVE THE ONLINE

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:52.983
MARKETPLACE WITH SO TATER.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.218
FROM SALES TAXES.

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:56.120
JUST IN SUMMARY I KNOW THIS IS A

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:56.787
LITTLE BIT.

00:40:56.854 --> 00:40:57.421
I TRIED NOT TO BE TOO TECHNICAL

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:58.856
BUT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT

00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:01.926
WE HAVE LAW ON THE BOOKS.

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:03.794
IN FORMA REGULATION AND FORMER

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:05.963
STATUTE THAT.

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.810
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY.

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.345
BUT A MILLION DOLLAR SELLER

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.614
AFTER THEY PAY AMAZON THEIR CUT.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.148
AFTER THE COST OF GOODS SOLD

00:41:58.215 --> 00:42:00.117

THE CD TFA THAT THEY OWE THEIR

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:10.160
LIFE SAVINGS TIMES. TEN TO THEM

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:11.695

FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS SIR IS

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:15.766
EIGHT YEARS SIX EIGHT YEARS.

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:16.700
THE TAX.

00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:19.303
ITSELF HAS BEEN COMPLICATED THE

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.804
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IN TWO

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:21.705
THOUSAND TWELVE WAS EVEN QUOTED

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:23.407
AS SAYING THEY THOUGHT AMAZON

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:24.475
SHOULD A COLLECTING SALES TAX

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:26.510
RESPECT TO THE SALES WHICH THEY

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:27.344
PERFIL.

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:27.945
THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:29.346
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:30.748
OF MARKET PLACE.

00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:32.383
AND SO EVEN AS WE SPEAK TO

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:34.485
AMAZON AND THE FOLKS THAT USE

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:35.953
THESE FOR FILM AND PROGRAMS AND

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.187
HAD NO IDEA.

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:38.522
THAT EMINEM WAS TAKEN THEIR

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:40.057
STUFF AND PUTTING IN CALIFORNIA.

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:40.958
THERE ARE OTHER MARKET PLACES

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.226
OUT THERE THAT DON'T DO THAT AND

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:43.594
SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL TO

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:45.930
KIND OF CAPTURE ALL OF THAT AND

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:46.931
SO I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT BUT

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:48.632
YOU KNOW WHEN WE SAY THINGS ARE

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:50.067
NOT BEING RETROACTIVE KEEP IN

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:51.268
MIND THAT.

SO I'LL THAT AMAZON --

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:00.470
ANSWERS THEY LIKE TO SO RIGHT

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:02.172
NOW AMAZON IS COLLECTING TAX ON

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:04.041
AMAZON SPECIFIC PRODUCTS --

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:06.143
SO THIS WOULD NOW OF A FOR THIS

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:06.777
USING THE AMAZON PLATFORM FOR

00:49:06.843 --> 00:49:08.345
EXAMPLE THIS WOULD BE ALL NINE

00:49:08.412 --> 00:49:10.113
AMAZON RELATED PRODUCTS SO THE

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.049
ACTUAL BRAND OF AMAZON IF

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.483
THEY'RE SELLING TO NOPE YOU'RE

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:14.985
NOT UNDERSTANDING MY QUESTION --

00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:19.289
OKAY OR DIG USE TAX COLLECTED IS

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:22.259
THAT IS THAT REMOVED FROM THE

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:22.826
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:23.694
THRESHOLD DO YOU SEPARATE THAT

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.895
OR IS IT JUST EVERYTHING IS PUT

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:27.230
TOGETHER.

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:29.099
SO THERE WERE NO TAXES ON THE

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.267
INTEREST ON THE INTERNET SALES

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:32.269
FOR PROP.

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:33.837
FOR IN THIRD PARTY RETAILERS WHO

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.339
DO NOT HAVE DID NOT HAVE A BRICK

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.841
AND MORTAR NO SALES TAX IS BEING

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:39.443
COLLECTED SO YOU GOT THAT PART.

00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:40.644
SO NOW THE NEXT PART IS TRYING

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:42.112
TO FIGURE OUT IF THE SALES USE

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:44.247
