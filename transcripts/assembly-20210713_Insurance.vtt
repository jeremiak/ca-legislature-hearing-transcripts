PRESUMPTIVE INJURIES. I AM

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:54.258
EMPATHETIC TO THE AUTHORS

BY FIREFIGHTERS AND PUBLIC

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.397

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:02.299
INJURIES THAT ARE DENIED. WHICH

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:04.101
IS WHY MY RECOMMENDED

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:05.269
AMENDMENTS WOULD PROVIDE A

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:07.972
MODERATE INCREASE IN PENALTIES

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:10.241
FOR UNREASONABLE DENIALS. THE

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:12.143
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HAS FOR

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:14.645
RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS ONE OF

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:17.681
THOSE AMENDMENTS DEALS WITH THE

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:20.651
PENALTY AMOUNT. CONSIDERATION

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:22.286
WAS TAKEN INTO THE FACT THAT

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:24.188
THE PENALTY AMOUNT HAS NOT BEEN

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:25.890
CHANGED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND

00:40:25.956 --> 00:40:27.258
FOUR AND A MODERATE INCREASE TO

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:28.559
THE CAP IS REASONABLE AND

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.861
RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN INFLATION

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.197
AND THE COST OF LIVING. WITHOUT

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:35.099
MORE EVIDENCE OR DATA A LARGER

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:38.235
PENALTY. IN MY OPINION IS NOT

00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.904
PRUDENT ESPECIALLY SINCE THESE

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.006
PENALTIES ARE PAID BY PUBLIC

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:44.375
ENTITIES WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS.

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:45.476
TO ALLOW THIS MEASURE TO MOVE

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:46.343
FORWARD AND CONTINUE

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.878

PENALTY PROVISION. THAT NUMBER

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:04.295

DETERMINES THAT THE DENIAL OF

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:19.109

APPLY TO PUBLIC EMPLOYERS

WHICH I THINK IS A COMMON SENSE

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:59.343
MEASURE THAT WOULD SEEK TO

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:02.479
REDUCE. AND DETER UNREASONABLE

AN UNREASONABLE DENIAL OF THE

CLAIM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:33.344
THINK THAT'S PIVOTAL IN THIS

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.944
DISCUSSION. A IN THE NOW THE

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:34.778
BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:35.980

AMENDMENTS THAT WERE JUST. A

00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:40.284

AMENDMENTS ONE AND TWO AS

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:50.461
OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS- AND

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:51.028
WE MADE THAT CLEAR FOR SOME

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:53.764
TIME. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.165
REJECT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:57.267
THREE AND FOUR AS OUTLINED IN

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:04.908
PROVISIONS. FOUND IN THE BILL.

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.777
THOSE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD

00:44:06.844 --> 00:44:09.179
HAVE NO MEASURABLE IMPACT WOULD

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.781
NOT PROVIDE THE RELIEF THAT OUR

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.216
PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES NEED

00:44:12.282 --> 00:44:16.987
AND DESERVE. 55% BASED ON

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:18.922
REPUBLIC DATA THAT YOU COULD

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.224
GOOGLE WHILE YOU'RE LISTENING

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.494
TO ME 55% OF THESE CLAIMS ARE

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.498
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:28.766
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A TWENTY

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.301
THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALL RIGHT.

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:34.171

CALL CALLS 410% PENALTY AFTER

AND REASONABLE DENIAL. A

00:44:41.378 --> 00:44:42.679
REASONABLE DONALD IT'S BEEN

CLAIM THAT WAS WRITTEN RECENTLY

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.354
WITHHELD IS NOT A DETERRENT TO

00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:53.290
ANYTHING. WE THINK ALTHOUGH IT

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:56.326
SOUNDS LIKE A BIG INCREASE TO

00:44:56.393 --> 00:45:00.798
GO FROM 10% 225% THAT. A FIVE

00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:01.598

SAME TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:04.134
ISN'T MUCH OF A DETERRENT

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.437
EITHER. AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:07.871
BEEN ARRESTED WITH THE MATH

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:10.474
TRYING TO COME UP WITH. WHAT IS

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.576
THE RIGHT NUMBER TO DEFER TO

PRESUMPTIVE CASE TONIGHT IS I'M

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:20.230
SURE A LOT OF YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:22.132
A PATH BUT AMENDMENT BACK IN

NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. WHICH

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:25.235
REALLY STRENGTH IN THESE

00:53:25.302 --> 00:53:27.170
PRESUMPTIONS FOR THE EMPLOYEE-

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:28.738
VERY HARD FOR THESE THIRD PARTY

ADMINISTRATORS EMPLOYERS TO

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:32.709

YOU KNEW ABOUT IT IT WAS A BIG

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:36.713
DEAL. AND THAT WOULD OFTEN END

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.714

JUDGE AND I COME BACK IN A

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:45.188
PRACTICE AND- IT WAS JUST

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:46.923
INCREDIBLE THE NUMBER OF THESE

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.558
CASES THAT WERE GETTING DENIED.

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:51.061
VIRTUALLY EVERY CASE THAT I SAW

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:53.263

00:53:59.102 --> 00:54:00.670
THE CHANGE IN THESE CASES

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:02.872
SPECIFICALLY AND YOU GO BACK TO

00:54:02.939 --> 00:54:04.007
GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AND

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.475

00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:08.378
WORKERS COMP WITH SO RADICALLY

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:11.181
CHANGED WHERE. YOU HAD A CAP

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:13.149
PLACED ON IT AND YOU HAD THE

00:54:13.216 --> 00:54:14.884

BENEFIT ACTUALLY DELAYED AS

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:18.121
OPPOSED TO THE ENTIRE SPECIES

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:20.056
OF BENEFITS- AND BECAUSE OF

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:22.225
THAT CHANGE THESE. EMPLOYERS

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:22.993
FIGURED OUT THESE THIRD PARTY

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.694
MINISTERS THAT. IT WAS MORE

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.029
COST EFFECTIVE TO DENY THESE

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.797
CLAIMS THEN TO PICK UP THE

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.265
CLAIM AND PROVIDE BENEFITS.

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:31.601
OKAY AND JUST AN EXAMPLE I JUST

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:35.238
HAD A GUY WITH- STOMACH CANCER.

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:37.374
AND HE WAS HOSPITALIZED AND

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.642
THERE'S HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:40.977
IN MEDICAL EXPENSES THAT WERE.

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:44.614
INCURRED IN THE- ADMINISTRATOR

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:45.215
MADE THE DECISION HEY IF WE

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:47.283
DENY THIS. WE ARE A BETTER

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:48.918
NEGOTIATION POSITION WITH THE

00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:50.820
HOSPITAL AND THE FIVE HUNDRED

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:51.921
THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEN WE WOULD

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:55.325
BE IF WE ACCEPTED THE CLAIM. SO

00:54:55.392 --> 00:54:56.960
THEY ROLLED THE DICE BASICALLY-

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:57.827
UNFORTUNATELY THAT FELLOW

00:54:57.894 --> 00:55:00.363
PASSED AWAY AND- I JUST SETTLED

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.897
THE DEATH BENEFIT FOR HIS

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:03.566
WIDOW- SO THERE IS DEFINITELY A

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:04.968
BUSINESS ASPECT WHAT'S

00:55:05.035 --> 00:55:06.236
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IT IS JUST

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:12.842
SIMPLY MORE COSTEFFECTIVE. FOR

00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:16.146
SEARCH- AND I CURRENTLY HAVE

00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:16.813

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:24.187
HEART. OF THE TWENTY FOUR CASES

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:27.023
IN MY CASELOAD RIGHT NOW.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:27.590
TWENTY TWO OF THEM HAVE BEEN

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:30.126
DENIED. THAT'S IN THE FACE OF A

00:55:30.193 --> 00:55:32.762
PRESUMPTION. THAT'S IN THE FACE

00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:35.098
OF A DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER WHICH

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:36.499
HOW DO WE BUT A PRESUMPTION

THAT'S WORK RELATED THAT THAT

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:39.169
THAT SHOULD BE ALMOST

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:41.771
IMPOSSIBLE. TWENTY TWO OUT OF

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.773
TWENTY FOUR. IT IS SORT OF HARD

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.875
TO BREATHE IN THIS THING SO THE

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:46.443
FIRST TIME I'VE SPOKEN IN A

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:48.778
MATTER. OF SO THERE'S A REAL

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:51.247
COST OF THIS DELAY. I MENTIONED

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:51.848
MISTER WHITE LEE WHO

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:53.383

DURING THIS TIME. THERE'S A

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:10.400
REAL COST TO THESE DENIALS AND

REALLY NEEDS TO BE A

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:35.325

BY THE GOVERNOR. WE HAD ONE

00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:38.388
PROCESS UNDER SCHWARZENEGGER

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:40.323

GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN MORE

00:57:43.593 --> 00:57:46.262
RECENTLY. WE EXPECT THERE WILL

00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:49.299
BE ONE A PROCESS A WORKERS COMP

00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:51.367
REFORM PROCESS UNDER GOVERNOR

INCLUDING THE BUDGET AND- AND

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:04.480
OTHER MATTERS. BUT IN MY HUMBLE

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:06.549
OPINION THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:09.419
ON WORKERS COMP REFORM- AND

00:58:09.485 --> 00:58:10.820
PEOPLE REASONABLE PEOPLE MAY

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.522
DISAGREE WITH THIS BUT THE I

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.057
THINK THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:15.024
IS TO HAVE ALL PARTIES AT THE

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:18.261

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:21.231

WORKERS COMP SYSTEM. AND I

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:25.835
THINK ANY OTHER APPROACH STARTS

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:27.670
TO BECOME PIECEMEAL THERE MAY

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:29.339
BE VALID REASONS FOR THE

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:32.475
APPROACH. NEVERTHELESS THERE

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:33.977
ARE MANY MANY AFFECTED PARTIES

00:58:34.043 --> 00:58:38.214

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:54.631
AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH THAT BILL WAS

00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:58.534
SCALED BACK ON THE SAME THEORY-

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.770

ARE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL OF

OCCASIONALLY PUBLISHED CLAIMS

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.837
HANDLING THESE PENALTIES SERVE

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:37.039
AS A LITIGATION HOOK. THE SIZE

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:38.441
OF THE PROPOSED PENALTY WILL

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:39.742
CREATE INCENTIVE FOR

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:42.278
LITIGATION. ANY DENIED CLAIMS

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.614
IS AN INCREASED RISK FOR

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.582
LITIGATION NOBODY WANTS TO GO

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:48.918
DOWN THAT PATH THEY WANT TO

PROVIDE THOSE TIMELY BENEFITS.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.221

TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE DENIED

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:56.626
BENEFIT IS A VERY EXCESSIVE

01:04:56.692 --> 01:04:57.460
PENALTY PAID WITH TAXPAYER

01:04:57.526 --> 01:04:59.328

PENALTIES THREATENED TO FORCE

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:03.366

COSTLY AND TIME INTENSIVE

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:09.839
LITIGATION. I DO WANT TO

EXPOSURE TO CARCINOGENS HAPPENS

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.956
ON THE JOB. EVEN IF DOING SO

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:28.758

01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:31.294
BURDEN. ANY POLICE OFFICER WHO

NO JUSTIFICATION FOR A PENALTY

INCREASE AT THIS SIZE. IT

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:49.845

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:53.649
INTRODUCING LITIGATION WHICH IS

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.318
MOST DETRIMENTAL TO THE INJURED

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:58.087
WORKER. IN ADDITION TO TAX FREE

01:05:58.154 --> 01:05:59.722

FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:18.274
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:19.575
IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:22.144

THE COMPLETE LACK OF EVIDENCE

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:14.824
SHOULD BE A GIANT RED FLAG.

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.325
I'VE COME IN HERE TIME AFTER

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:18.260

ABILITY. UNDER THE LAW TO

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.269
DEMONSTRATE THAT A CLAIM IS NOT

01:08:27.336 --> 01:08:29.305
RELATED TO WORK OKAY AND THE

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:31.207
ARGUMENT BACK TO US HAS ALWAYS

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.542
BEEN WELL THE REBUTTABLE. THE

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.244
LARGEST IMPACT OF THIS BILL IS

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:36.645
GOING TO SEND A SIGNAL TO

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.347
PUBLIC EMPLOYERS THAT THEY

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:40.616
SHOULD NOT. BE GOOD STEWARDS OF

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:41.684
TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND THEY

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.085
SHOULD NOT QUESTION THESE

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:45.654
CLAIMS EVEN WHEN. IN THE FEW

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:48.123
CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS EVIDENCE

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:49.325
TO THE CONTRARY BECAUSE IF THEY

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:52.228
DO IT. AND THEY'RE WRONG THEY

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:52.795
WILL GET HIT WITH A MASSIVE

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:54.830
PENALTY. THE APPLICANT ATTORNEY

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:56.298
THAT SPOKE A FEW A FEW NUMBERS

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:57.066
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A FEW

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:58.167
DIFFERENT NUMBERS PRESENT ALSO

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:00.336
DID A REVIEW OF CLAIMS FOR MORE

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.571
THAN TWENTY FOUR. IN OUR REVIEW

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:05.040
OF CLAIMS 86% OF THE CLAIMS

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:05.908
WERE ACCEPTED ALMOST

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.844
IMMEDIATELY. AND OF THE CLAIMS

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:10.980
THAT WERE DENIED 1% WERE

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:12.915
OVERTURNED. THAT IS NOT US

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.184
GETTING IT WRONG THE DATA

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:17.419
SIMPLY DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS.

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:18.187
THE APPLICANT TOURNEY ALSO

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:19.855
MENTION THAT THESE PENALTIES

01:09:19.922 --> 01:09:21.056
WOULD ONLY BE APPLIED ONCE

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:23.058
ADJUDICATED BY A JUDGE THAT IS

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:25.628
NOT IN FACT THE CASE FREQUENTLY

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.062
THESE PENALTIES ARE FILED AND

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.397
THEN THEY'RE LEFT AS PART OF

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:29.298
THE SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATION AT

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:30.833
THE END OF THE CLAIM. JUDGES IN

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:31.967
COURTS DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE

01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:33.602
TIME TRYING THESE ISSUES

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.070
BECAUSE THEY'RE RATHER.

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:36.739
COMPLICATED AND SO THEY'RE

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.407
PUSHED OUT INTO THE HALL TO

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:39.842
SETTLE THEM THIS IS A

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:41.877
SETTLEMENT MAGNIFYING TYPE OF

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:44.647
POLICY IT WILL PUT RISK ON THE

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:45.614
FILE THAT WILL HAVE TO BE

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:47.449
SETTLED. TO AVOID THE RISK OF

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.318
TRIAL THAT'S THE WAY THE SYSTEM

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:54.523
WORKS. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.225

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:31.279
GO ALONG THEIR MERRY WAY IF THE

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:33.348
NUMBER IS HI THERE WE'RE

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:35.317
TALKING ABOUT AN INDUSTRY THAT

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:38.820
IS ABUSING THE CLAIMS PROCESS-

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:41.990
BUT I'M REASONABLY DENY CLAIMS

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:43.191
OR PRESUMPTIVE IN THE FIRST

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:44.993
PLACE TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.695
VALUE MOST IN OUR PUBLIC

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.863
EMPLOYMENT. OUR FIREFIGHTERS

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:51.766
FOR EXAMPLE SO IN THAT CASE I

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:54.002
DON'T THINK WE CAN GO WRONG I

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:56.938
THINK IF WE WERE TO ACCEPT OF

01:22:57.005 --> 01:23:00.141
MY MOUTH. OUR SUGGESTION. WITH

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.209
A CAP OF FIFTY THOUSAND

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:05.013
DOLLARS- AT FIVE TIMES. IN

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.681
THERE'S VERY FEW CLAIMS THEN

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:07.682
THIS MULTI BILLION DOLLAR

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:08.750
INDUSTRY SHOULDN'T BE SO

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.151
CONCERNED A MULTI BILLION

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:12.087
DOLLAR MUNICIPALITIES SHOULDN'T

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:12.787
BE SO CONCERNED IF WE SHOULD

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:15.090
JUST MOVE ON- BUT I DON'T THINK

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:17.926
­INK.

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:21.229
MIND IS THAT THIS ISN'T JUST A

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:22.797
DIDN'T A DETERRENT AGAINST. A

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:24.199
DETERRENT OF UNREASONABLE

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.868
CLAIMS. BUT IS AN INCENTIVE TO

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:28.536
CREATE A MORE SAFE WORK PLACE

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:30.105
IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:30.739
THESE PRESUMPTIVE CLAIMS DON'T

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:34.275
ARISE. IT IF THERE'S NO. IF

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.678
THAT'S NOT. AN ISSUE THEN IT'S

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:37.746
NOT IN IT I THINK THAT'S

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:38.680
PROBABLY THE MORE FOR

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.882
FOUNDATION FOR THE- FOR THE

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:42.183
COMMITTEE TO TAKE UP. THANK

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:46.221
YOU. THANK YOU AND JUST TO. ONE

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:47.956
LAST THOUGHT ON THAT IT WOULD

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:50.525
BE HELPFUL TO KNOW. THE SCALE

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:53.528
AND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM.

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:57.732
BUT YOUR BILL ADDRESSES AND- WE

01:23:57.799 --> 01:23:59.567
TALKED ABOUT THAT IN OUR

01:23:59.634 --> 01:24:03.805
CONVERSATIONS- AND HI YOU KNOW-

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:07.375
IF. TO THE EXTENT THE PROBLEM

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:12.013
IS GENUINE- AS I SAID BEFORE I

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.282
THINK IT CAN BE ADDRESSED. IN

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:16.484
AN OVERALL REFORM OF THE

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:18.553
WORKERS COMP SYSTEM WHEN WE'RE

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:21.389

COMPLICATED SUBJECT WHETHER ANY

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:24.826

THINK- SENATE QUARTERS HE I

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:15.944
THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES. IS

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.979
THAT THERE IS NOT AN ADEQUATE

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:18.613
RECORD LAID DOWN OF THE

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.815
PROBLEMS. IN THE REALM OF

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:22.050
WORKERS COMP INSURANCE THIS

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:23.918
ACTUALLY MEANS WE CANNOT REALLY

ANALYZE THE PRO AND CON

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.956

THE MARKET PLACE. IT WAS A

01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:58.786
CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THE

WITH THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM

NINETEEN NINETY THREE. I'VE

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:19.440

ALWAYS IN THESE CONVERSATIONS.

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:28.550
THERE IS INVARIABLY A LOT OF

01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:29.717
PUSHING AND SHOVING FROM THE

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:33.922
VERY INTEREST GROUPS- AS WE CAN

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:35.390
WE'RE ALL QUITE ACQUAINTED.

01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:37.258
NONE THE LESS THEY ARE ALWAYS

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:39.294
VERY FACT BASED REFORMS HERE IN

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.063

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:44.999
WORK WHICH CONDUCTED STUDIES A

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:46.901
STATE AGENCY. WE HAVE THE

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.636
RENDON'S TO SUSAN SANTA MONICA

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:49.971
THAT DOES A LOT OF WORK FOR THE

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.307
WORKERS COMP FIELD. VERY OFTEN

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:53.575
INVOLVED AND TAP FOR THEIR

01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:55.777
EXPERTISE TO DELVE INTO THE

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:59.013
MEETING OF NUMBERS LIKEWISE- OF

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.281
THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMP

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.617
INSURANCE RATING BUREAU WCI ARE

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:04.619
BE. LONG TIME PARTICIPANT IN

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:08.590
THESE CONVERSATIONS LIKEWISE

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:09.157
THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMP

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:15.663
INSTITUTE. SO IT IS MY

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:17.599
MADE TO WORKERS COMP ISSUES

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.033
ONCE A SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:23.972
CRYSTALLIZED AND WE PURSUE FAX

01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:26.407
TO ELIMINATE THAT ISSUE SO THAT

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:27.842
IN FACT YOU CAN REACH A

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:30.912
CONCLUSION THAT THERE ARE OR

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:33.081
ARE NOT INCENTIVES. THAT THE

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:35.183
WORDING OF A PARTICULAR PHRASE

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:38.186
OR THE OPERATIONS GIVEN PENALTY

01:27:38.252 --> 01:27:40.822
OR PROCEDURAL HURDLE IS OR IS

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:42.857
NOT HAPPILY WORDED OR UN

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:46.361
HAPPILY WORK- SO I DO THINK

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:50.398
PARTICULARLY DEAL AS AS I KNOW.

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:51.666
THE GREAT CITY OF SAN JOSE

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.935
WHERE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL- OF

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:55.503
SANTA CLARA COUNTY THESE ARE

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.472
SELF INSURED ENTITIES. THERE

01:27:57.538 --> 01:28:00.375
ARE THERE IS A TAX PAYER STEAK

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.710
AND ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS SO

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:04.178
I THINK THE MATTER THAT

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:06.481
CONCERNS ME IS JUST THAT. THIS

01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:08.883
PARTICULAR CONVERSATION IN A

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.551
CRITICAL TIME ACTUALLY TO HELP

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.520
OUR CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE GET

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:16.257
BACK EMPLOYEES BE HIRED JOBS

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:17.458
JUST SORT OF A LACK OF

01:28:17.525 --> 01:28:19.293
INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THIS

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.796
PURPOSE SPECIFIC REFORM- THAT'S

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:22.997
NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ARE

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:26.467
NOT FACTUAL QUESTIONS WE SHOULD

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:28.970
ASK PEOPLE TO. ILLUMINATE BUT-

01:28:29.037 --> 01:28:33.007
I ACTUALLY FEEL IT'S- TO KIND

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:35.276
OF GO BACK TO THE PRE TWO

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:36.077
THOUSAND FOUR LANGUAGE ON

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:38.579
PENALTIES WITHOUT A FUNDAMENTAL

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:41.049
EXAMINATION OF DATA I THINK

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:42.884
THAT'S THE LOGICAL IN A VERY

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:45.119
UNUSUAL DIRECTION IN A WORKERS

01:28:45.186 --> 01:28:46.954
COMP FEEL TRASHY STRONGLY

01:28:47.021 --> 01:28:48.956
SUPPORT THE CHAIRS-

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:52.560
RECOMMENDATION ON BUT I THINK

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:53.561
FACTUAL QUESTIONS ARE ALWAYS IN

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.563
ORDER. AND THE TWO COMMITTEES

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:58.433
COULD EVEN INQUIRE- FOR FURTHER

01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:00.468
STUDIES UT WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:02.837
RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA TO SHED

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:05.807
LIGHT ON. MR COOLEY YOUR

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:06.874
SUGGESTION OF FURTHER STUDY IS

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:08.943
A- AS WELL TAKEN AND I THINK

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.712
ALL ASK OUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:14.382
PUT TOGETHER A- AN OUTLINE FOR

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:15.750
THAT VERY THING TO DO A LITTLE

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:18.219
BIT MORE FACT GATHERING MISTER

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:19.253
GIBSON HAS A QUESTION OR

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.755
COMMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND

SENATE BUT NONE THE LESS- I AM

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:31.632
ALSO- IS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.367
THIS BILL COULD BE HEARD AND

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:35.470
THE REASON WHY I ASKED THAT

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:36.938
QUESTION IS BECAUSE- I WAS

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:39.574
ASKING MY- MY TEAM MEMBER- FOR.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.576

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:42.577
COMMENTS THAT BOTH MY

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:44.412
COLLEAGUES. MADE MENTION OF THE

IS HOPING. TO ADDRESS THE

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:50.618
PROBLEM AND I'VE HEARD FROM THE

01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:52.320
SPEAKERS THAT I DID IN FACT

01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:54.822
HEAR FROM- THAT THERE WAS NO

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:58.459
DATA. TO SHOW- CONCLUSIVELY HOW

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:00.595
THIS. HOW THIS BILL IS HELPING

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:01.662
A PROBLEM TRYING TO SOLVE THE

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:03.331
PROBLEM. AND MANY OF YOU KNOW

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:05.500

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.728

NONE OF THEM. ACTUALLY WORK ON-

01:37:34.415 --> 01:37:35.516
PHIL'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR THE

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:37.618
MIDDLE FOR A REGULAR- THESE TWO

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:38.919

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:05.779

IN MY THIRTY YEARS I SAW PLENTY

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:24.658
OF CASES BOTH WANT TO COME BACK

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:25.993
TO WORK BEFORE THE SHOULD BE

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:27.961
RETIRED AND WORKERS COMP DRAG

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:30.164
THEIR FEET. AND IT DID THE DAY

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:32.199
IT COMES DOWN TO MONEY. WE'RE

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:33.867
TALKING PRESUMPTIVE INJURIES

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:34.868

IS NOT BEING APPLIED THAT WAY

01:39:43.577 --> 01:39:46.380
THE CANCER PRESUMPTIVE. SO HERE

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:47.614
TWO FEMALE OFFICERS I KNOW

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:48.248

CHILDREN. HAD A HEART ATTACK.

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:20.080

01:40:20.147 --> 01:40:20.914
LOT OF INVESTMENTS A LOT OF

01:40:20.981 --> 01:40:22.850

DELAYED AND DRAGGED ON THERE'S

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:43.103
A MECHANISM FOR THAT. AND

01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:43.637
SOMETIMES IT BEHOOVES THE

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:46.940
WORKERS CAUGHT. FOLKS TO DRAG

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:47.474

01:40:55.783 --> 01:40:57.985
SOMETIMES IT HAS GOT TO BE A

01:40:58.051 --> 01:40:59.853
LOT OF CASES IT CAN BE JUST A

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.455
