THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE PROCEED. EACH YEAR JOSEPH JOHNSON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF SENDING ON COVERED CALIFORNIA'S ITEM. AND DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF FEDERAL SUBSIDY FUNDING STANDING BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ADMINISTRATION ACROSS THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION TO REINSTITUTE CAL THREE INSTITUTO FOR HIS PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM. FOR BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THIS WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY MR FONG. WITHOUT GOING IS FUNDED THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND NOW THE PROPOSED PROGRAM CONTINUES. TO PROVIDE PREMIUM SUPPORT TO LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS JUST SAYS IN. TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE KNOW THAT THIS LEVEL SUPPORT IS MORE GENEROUS THAN WHAT IS ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL ACA LEVELS. AND IN ADDITION THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES FOR MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF ARCA- COMPARED TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROGRAM. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM PROVIDES INCREASED SUPPORT TO MIDDLE INCOME INDIVIDUALS BY REDUCING THE CONTRIBUTION CAP FROM 18% TO SIXTEEN PERCENT. OF ENROLLEES INCOME WHO ARE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND 6100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL- FINANCE NOTES. SUSAN GOT A FUNDING EXPIRE AT THE END TWENTY TWO. IN A STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM IS NOT REINSTATED INDIVIDUALS ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED FPL WILL LOSE PREMIUM SUPPORT ENTIRELY BASED ON THE CURRENT AC LEVELS OF SUPPORT. WE NOTE THAT THE ORIGINAL STATES OF THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED WITH THE INTENTION OF SYSTEM- THE MIDDLE CLASS. NOT ONLY DOES THIS PROPOSAL BUILD UPON THAT ORIGINAL DESIGN WITH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IT ALSO AIMS TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL EXPIRATION OF FEDERAL SUBSIDY FUNDING. LASTLY THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES STATUTORY CHANGES TO ALIGN WITH PROPOSED STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. BUT THAT'LL POTS FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- L. A- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. MOREOVER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE WOULD WE ARE STILL REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- WE DO THINK THERE IS A STRONG POLICY BASIS IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-DOES NOT EXTEND. THE ENHANCED PREMIUM SUBSIDIES TO PROVIDE- STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES TO ENSURE THAT. HOW CALIFORNIA REMAINS AFFORDABLE AND DATA MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF REDUCED- HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF INDIVIDUALS. CANCELING THE HEALTH INSURANCE IF THEY FACE HIGHER PREMIUMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH THIS IS A BEEN AN ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN TRACKING CAREFULLY AND SO I'M GLAD THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RESPONDED IN A- WE HOPE IT WILL BE AN APPROPRIATE. MANNER AFTER THE L. A- REALLY DIGS DOWN INTO IT BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WILL REALLY HURT PEOPLE AND THE POCKETBOOKS OF THE IF THE- IF THE FEDS CUT OFF THIS IS SO. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND SO I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT IT'S INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. DR PAN. I THANK YOU AND FIRST OF ALL I DO APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL FROM THE- ADMINISTRATION OF THE MAY REVISE- TO RESTORE THE- ESSENTIALLY A PREVIOUS SUBSIDY PROGRAM WE HAD BEFORE THE- AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT. BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I WOULD POSE AND I DON'T KNOW THEIR- PERHAPS COVER CALIFORNIA MIGHT BE THE ONE MOST APPROPRIATELY TO ANSWER THIS SO MY CONCERN IS THAT. AT LEAST FROM MY UNDERSTANDING- THE- THIS COMPONENT THE IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLANS AT THE SUBSIDIES FOR. ESSENTIALLY COVERED CALIFORNIA THE LARGER X. YA OVER OVERALL THROUGH THE ARE BUT THAT THAT DOES ACTUALLY FAIRLY AS YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME FAIRLY BROAD SUPPORT FOR THAT- NOW IT WAS PUT LUMP BILLS PUT IN THIS PART BILL BACK BETTER PLAN SO AND THAT YOU KNOW HAS HAD PROBLEMS AND THAT'S WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN ACTION TAKEN- SO. THERE IS POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AT THE END OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE ARE BOTH COURTS WOULD END AT THE END OF. DECEMBER SO THERE IS UNCERTAINTY. THE ISSUE I GUESS SAID RAISES THAT IN THIS PERHAPS AGAIN THIS QUESTION FOR COERED CALIFORNIA IS THAT. NOW YOU'RE NEGOTIATING THE RATES WITH THE PLANS OVER THE SUMMER. CORRECT. AND I AS YOU REVEL EVERY CALIFORNIA YES WE ARE YES SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT WHY APPRECIATE THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT BASICALLY THE PLANS LOOKING AS A OKAY THERE'S A POSSIBILITY ARE BUT GOES AWAY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE ANY ACTION. THERE WHILE THERE WILL BE SOME SUBSIDIES IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE DEFINITELY BE A DROP THEY'LL STILL BE A BIT OF A CLIFF FOR OUR- YOU KNOW FOR THE PEOPLE WERE FOUR HUNDRED PROBABLY A LAUGH THE L. LESS OF A CLIFF THAN THEY WOULD HAD BEEN WITHOUT THIS ACTION. BUT SO FAR AND THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON PREMIUMS AND EVEN IF CONGRESS TO SAY THE ACT LET'S SEE AS IN THE LAME DUCK SESSION AND EXTEND THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A FAIRLY. THIS IS A FAIRLY POPULAR PROVISION. WE WOULD STILL BE STUCK WITH INCREASED RATES BECAUSE THE RATES WERE A NEGOTIATED IN THE FALL AND IT FACT. THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RATE INCREASES OF COURSE WILL BE COMING OUT WHEN WE'RE DOING OPEN ENROLLMENT RIGHT BEFORE. LET'S JUST SAY- WHAT HAPPENED IN NOVEMBER- MAYBE LATE OCTOBER NOVEMBER- NOT SURE WHY THAT PARTICULAR TIME THE YEAR MIGHT BE REALLY IMPORTANT BUT SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT- SO. MMHM SO ZIGGY'S TO WHAT YOU THINK MAY HAPPEN AGAIN I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T NEGOTIATE BUT YOU KNOW- I GUESS THE MOST WAS LIKE. IF THE STATE STEPPED UP AND PROVIDED. NOT LEAST ONE MORE YEAR- SOME INCREASE SUBSIDY- FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR SO I'VE BEGIN PREHEAT THE NEXT RACES PROPOSAL FOR THE FOR DOING THE ON GOING YOU KNOW PREVIOUS OF THE PROGRAM AND ONGOING SO AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I GUESS I WOULD OPEN THE IDEA SAYING THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD DO A LITTLE MORE FOR THE COMING YEAR. YOU KNOW BUT AGAIN IN THE HOPES THAT CONGRESS WILL STEP UP AND THEN OUR VOTERS BUT ALSO TO ANOTHER TO PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PREMIUMS WHILE COVERED CALIFORNIA NEGOTIATED PREMIUMS OF THE SUMMER TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT IN CASE OUR BUT DOESN'T GO. SO IS THAT A IS THAT A VALID. CONCERN I MEAN WHEN COVERED CALIFORNIA'S NEGOTIATING WITH THIS PLANTS ESTABLISHED A RATES FOR NEXT OPEN ENROLLMENT- WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THIS IS A VERY VALID CONCERN WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS CONTINGENCY AS BEST AS WE CAN. I'M NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THIS POSITION WE ARE IN THIS POSITION IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. BUT WE HAVE ASKED OUR CARRIERS TO PREPARE THEIR RATES ASSUMING THAT CURRENT LAW- THAT COMES TO PASS SO A. R. P. AB PREMIUM SUBSIDIES EXPIRE. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO SUBMIT TO US IS THEIR INITIAL RATES. WE'VE ALSO ASKED THEM TO SHARE WITH US AFFECTED BY WHICH RATES MIGHT DROP IF A. R. P. SUBSIDIES ARE CONTINUED SO. AS WE'RE IN THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER AND AS WE WORK WITH OUR REGULATOR PARTNERS AND WE HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE DIFFERENT SETS OF RATES AND TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THEM TO CONSUMERS BASED ON. THE ACTION THAT THE CONGRESS TAKES BUT I THINK YOU FLAG THE REALLY IMPORTANT- INFLECTION POINT IN THE TIME LINE WHICH IS IF WE GET INTO OCTOBER. WHEN WE START OUR RENEWAL PROCESSES WHEN WE STARTED TELL CONSUMERS WHETHER TWENTY TWENTY THREE RATES ARE GOING TO BE. AND AT THAT POINT WE ARE MUCH MORE LOCKED IN A LESS ABLE TO PAY THAT AND THEN TO YOUR POINT WE MAY HAVE LOCKED IN ARTIFICIALLY HIGH RATES IF THEY'RE P. SUBSIDIES ARE THEN EXTENDED IN THE LAME DUCK SESSION SO. THAT THAT IS NOT A GOOD CASE SCENARIO BUT WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IN THAT SCENARIO OKAY SO I APPRECIATE THAT SO I GUESS I WOULD SUGGEST CONSIDERATION AND AGAIN PRECIADO WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED I WOULD SUGGEST CONSIDERATION OF PERHAPS A- ONE TIME ONE YEAR. YOU KNOW CROSS OUR FINGERS ON A. R. P. COMMITMENT FOR SUBSIDIES FOR ANOTHER YEAR- TO TRY TO PUT THAT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE RATES. SIR WHAT WOULD BE A YOU'RE- OLD. THE PREVIOUS OF. AND HOW THAT CAN WILL DO RIGHT THING TURNS OUT AND J. WE CAN DO A BUDGET LETTER WHAT TURNS OUT WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO USE THAT MONEY BUT THAT BUT THEN WHICH IS WE DON'T LOCK IN THE HIGHER RATES BECAUSE EVEN IF CONGRESS ACTS. IN THE LAME DUCK SESSION WE WERE LOCKED IN THE HIGHER RATES. SO I JUST WANT YOU KNOW I'M I THINK ABOUT. OUR COMMITMENT TO PUT IN SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY WE MAY ACTUALLY GET YOU KNOW THE SAID THAT EVERY DOLLAR COMMITMENT WE ACTUALLY MAY GET A BIGGER BANG FOR A BUCK. GOING BACK YOU KNOW IN RETURN. BECAUSE OF THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE WE COULD PLAY ON RATES DURING NEGOTIATION OVER THE SUMMER. SO SO HOPING I WANT TO. PUT THAT IDEA OUT THERE. AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR OUR BUDGET AND I BELIEVE IN THIS. REGIONAL CENTER PROPOSAL WE DID IT AT SUGGEST PUTTING PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE- THAN WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THE REVISED. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DR PAN WE WILL. CERTAINLY MISS YOUR EXPERTISE- OKAY NOW WITH A MOVE ON- TO THE OVERVIEW OF THE MATE REVISION ITEMS PROPOSED FOR MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PACKAGE IN THE INVESTMENTS IN THE CARE COURT PROPOSAL. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE YOU READY TO PROCEED JOHNSON AGAIN FROM FROM FINANCE ALL BEGIN WITH A BRIEF INTRODUCTION THAT ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE PROPOSAL THAT INCLUDES BOTH AGE CUNNINGHAM AND CDPH NO HEAD OR TO MY COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK WITH MORE DETAIL. SO THE ME REVISION INCLUDES- GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES GLORIA FIFTY SEVEN MILLION SUPPORT SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. I'M SPECIFIC TO EACH CLIENT- THERE IS A SURPRISE REQUESTING A ONE TIME FORTY MILLION GENERAL FUND COST TO ESTABLISH AN UNCOMPENSATED CARE FUND TO ASSIST WITH COSTS FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. REQUESTED FUNDING WOULD ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM TO SUPPORT ABORTION CARE AND CONTRACEPTION SERVICES FOR THOSE WITHOUT SUCH HEALTH COVERAGE THROUGH FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PROVIDERS OF THESE CRITICAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. I MEAN ADDITION- H. CHRIS REQUESTING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT AND EDUCATION OF THIS PROGRAM AT THIS TIME ALL HEADED OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE NICK MILLS DISCUSSED. THE CDPH PROPOSALS.

ON SEXUAL HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUES. ONE MILLION IS REQUESTED TO DEVELOP AND SUPPORT OF COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS WEBSITES. AND ONE MILLION IS REQUESTED FOR RESEARCH ON UNMET REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE NEEDS- WE AND OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- BELIAU MR WELCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN KOREA'S DATA WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING- THAT THE TOTALITY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PACKAGE BUT WE DO HAVE SOME INITIAL COMMENTS TO REYES JUST ON THE PROPOSAL FOR UNCOMPENSATED CARE FUND FOR ABORTION SERVICES- WHILE THE CONCEPT OF THIS PROPOSAL HAS HAS MERIT- THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION. HOW IT ESTIMATED FORTY MILLION TO BE THE PROPER AMOUNT FOR THIS THIS PROPOSAL- AND RELATEDLY WHETHER IT CAN PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ON HOW MUCH IS CURRENTLY SPEND ON UNCOMPENSATED CARE FOR ABORTION SERVICES. STATEWIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR JOHNSON- MISTER MILLS CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION. HOW DO WE COME UP WITH FORTY MILLION HOW MUCH DO WE SPEND. NOW. I JUST DON'T SEND IN FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE- ACTUAL- HANDS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM EACH CAR TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL. I'M SORRY THANK YOU HI CAN RISE OUT- WITH H. HI I'M- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF- INVESTIGATING MATH TO DETERMINE- M. BUT WE ARE RESEARCHING THAT DATA RIGHT NOW HOW MUCH THE COST CURRENTLY IS BUT DO WE KNOW HOW TO HOW DID WE COME UP WITH THAT FORTY MILLION DOLLAR. PRICE TAG. I'M SORRY I'M WHAT WE'VE- ESTIMATED- IN TERMS OF THE COST- THAT WE HAVE- SEEN FOR EXAMPLE THAT- PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEALTH CENTERS ROAD OFF ALMOST NINE MILLION IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO COVER COSTS OF PROVIDING CARE TO PATIENTS- OUT WHO COULD NOT AFFORD IT SO- IN TERMS OF THAT THE FUNDING OVER MULTIPLE YEARS- THIS WAS ONE ONE BASELINE PIECE OF DATA. THREE FIGURE OF NINE MILLION WAS ONE YEAR THAN FORTY MILLION OR TAKE OVERS. OVER SEVERAL YEARS. OKAY OKAY WELL WE WILL CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN THE- SEE MORE THE DATA AFTER YOU ANALYZED IT- PREPARE. YOU FOLKS SO JUST JUST TO CLARIFY THE FUNDING FOR ENCOMPASS THE RIVER ITSELF DESCRIBED THIS IT'S THE GRANTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND- SO IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE GRANTS THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS- BECAUSE THAT'S SO. IT IS A TIED TO SERVING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE OR IS IT SIMPLY SAYING OKAY YOU TAKE THIS GRANT YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE ABORTION SERVICES ARE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES TO. ANYONE WHO WHO WHO WHO. WHO NEEDS IT HE SHOWS SHOWS UP I MEAN I GUESS WHAT THE PARAMETERS OF THE PARTICULARS OF THE GRANT FOR THE FINDINGS I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A GRANT IT'S NOT A REIMBURSEMENT CORRECT. CORRECT CORRECT IT'S A GRANT TO- YOU KNOW WE INTEND TO- TO GRANT THIS TO A MANAGING AGENCY WHO HAS EXPERIENCE- WORKING WITH- YOU KNOW TITLE TEN- AND SERVING THOSE THAT ARE- THAT ARE- PROVIDE BEING PROVIDED THIS CARE TODAY. OKAY ALL RIGHT AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE BECAUSE- THAT THE FORTY MILLION ACTUALLY IF IT'S OVER SIX YEARS SO THAT'S ROUGHLY IT'S LIKE WHAT FIVE AND A HALF MILLION PER YEAR. I GET THAT TO THE MATH RATE. SOMEWHERE YES IT ACTUALLY AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN- YOU KNOW AWARD MORE- IN THE IN THERE SOONER IN THE SOONER YEARS EARLIER YEARS OKAY ALL RIGHT- YEAH I MEAN I THINK WHAT WE'RE FACING IS A POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW POTENTIAL SITUATION WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT MORE UNCOMPENSATED CARE POTENTIALLY SHOWING UP IN CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK COULD BE BETTER YOU'LL BE GOOD TO HAVE A BETTER ANALYSIS- WHAT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT NUMBER IT SEEMS TO BE PERHAPS LOWER ON THE LOW SIDE FOR SIX YEARS- JUST JUST. GIVEN THE INFORMATION GIVEN US SO FAR IN THIS HEARING- THE OTHER I GUESS THE OTHER ISSUE ISN'T THAT ISN'T STRICTLY BUDGETARY BUT I THINK IT'S RELATED TO THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL. IS THAT ALSO. THERE RESOURCES BEING PROVIDED TO FOR. I WOULD CALL IT YOU KNOW PRIVACY OR DATA SECURITY. SO THE CHALLENGES IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING THE SERVICES THESE ARE SENSITIVE SERVICES WELL CERTAINLY THERE ARE LAWS IN PLACE FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. RIGHT HIP- WE OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW. THOSE LAWS DON'T APPLY TO NON HEALTHCARE ENTITIES SO LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES OTHER DATA BROKERS AND SO FORTH. AND THAT THAT INFORMATION COULD BE USED TO- BY. OTHERS PERHAPS EVEN OTHER STATES- TO- TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM. SEEKING CARE- SO- ARE WE LOOKING INTO OUR INVESTING ANYTHING INTO PROVIDING EITHER EDUCATION OR- TOOLS FOR PEOPLE WHO SEEK REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. WHO MAY BE AT RISK BECAUSE OF PRIVACY ISSUES. I'M SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS- IN OUR PREVIOUS PROPOSAL- THAT WAS THE- FOR A FORTY MILLION TWENTY MILLION FOR. INCREASING ACCESS FOR PROVIDERS AS WELL AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT BY THE TWENTY MILLION AND SO WE SEE THAT THAT IS WHERE WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WE COULD FOCUS ON SOME OF THOSE AREAS TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT TWO. PROVIDERS FOR THIS IS THAT SEPARATE PROPOSAL- FROM THIS ONE OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THAT YEAH IT'S WELL IT'S NOT JUST RIGHTS ACTUALLY PATIENTS WHO NEED THAT HELP- BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WILL BE AT RISK. CERTAINLY PROVIDERS MAY BE AT RISK TO- BUT ALSO PATIENTS MAY BE AT RISK AS WELL. BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MS RESULT OKAY. LET'S MOVE ON. YOUR COURT. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BURST MEANS WE ARE ALMOST LEAD TO PERMANENT FINANCE I WILL SPEAK TO THE MEMBER VERSION PROPOSALS FOR CARE COURT THE MERRY MISSION INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- COURT THE CITY PROPOSAL WAS DISCUSSED ON TUESDAY HEARING AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S PROPOSAL WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER THIS WEEK. ADDITIONALLY THE PURPLE OR PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING FOR THE DH CS TO IMPLEMENT CARE CORD TO PROVIDE COUNTY TRAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DATA COLLECTION REPORTING AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AS CARE CURRENT MOVES TO THE POLICY PROCESS AND WILL WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO THE EXTENT THESE AS MUCH CHANGE. WITH THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. VERY MUCH OF SHE- THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN COREY SHE DALY UP- WE HAVE SOME INITIAL COMMENTS REYES ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION CARE COURT PROPOSALS WHICH CUT ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE ACS- AS THE ADMINISTRATION JUST ALLUDED TO- IN ADDITION TO BE ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION- WITH ONE MILLION ON GOING PROPOSED REACH THE ASK THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSES ROUGHLY FORTY MILLION WITH ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ON GOING TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH FOR COURT PROCEEDINGS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR COURT- AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. TO ADMINISTER THE CARE COURTS SUPPORTER PROGRAM- WE UNDERSTAND THAT- THE IMPLEMENTING LANGUAGE FOR CARE COURT IS CURRENTLY AND SENATE BILL THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT- SINCE THE SPILL IS YOU'LL STILL GOING THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS- THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE FINAL LANGUAGE WILL BE SENSE- SOME CHANGES TO THE IMPLEMENTING OF LANGUAGE ARE POSSIBLE- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING NEEDED FOR- BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INSURE CARE COURT OPERATES EFFECTIVELY- DEPEND ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE FINAL LEGISLATION WILL BE- AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS STATED THAT IT'S STILL WORKING WITH COUNTIES TO IDENTIFY. POTENTIAL LOCAL COSTS- WE ALSO FIND THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KEY CONSIDERATIONS THAT- WHEN WORKED OUT THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS COULD ALSO IMPACT COSTS OF THESE INCLUDE HEALTHCARE COURT IS SUPPOSED TO INTERACT WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE HOW- OR- HOW INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED AN OFFENCE SUCH AS SOMEONE DOWN TO B. I. S. T. ON A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE WILL INTERACT WITH THE CARE COURT PROCESS- YEAH WITHOUT FULLY IDENTIFIED STATE AND LOCAL COSTS- WE FIND THAT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO WEIGH THIS PROPOSAL AGAINST OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES- AND- THESE REASONS- WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO CONSIDER THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISION PROPOSALS- IN. IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AT. THIS TIME- THE THEY'RE ALL OUR COMMENTS ON ON THE CARE SHE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS A LOT MORE THE STILL WISH TO WORKING THROUGH ON THAT- WOODS I WOULD I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- WELL WHY WON'T TAKE IN AS MUCH INTO THE- JUDICIAL BRANCH.

IMPORT BUT- WE WILL CONTINUE TO- TO WORK ON THIS AND SEE MORE LIKE MANY THINGS SPECIFIC HONOR YEAH I'M A GIVEN THE L. A. S COMMENTS AND- YOU KNOW IF. WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE LEGISLATION I GUESS FROM FINANCE- BECAUSE I DON'T SEE IN THE- THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL AND THIS CAME UP IN THE- TESTIMONY REGARDING THE LEGISLATION WHICH WE HEARD AND OUR HEALTH COMMITTEE WHICH I CHAIR- IS THERE A COMMITMENT. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO ACTUAL PROVIDE FUNDING TO COUNTIES AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR THEIR- FOR THE THINGS THAT THEY'LL BE REQUIRED TO DO- FOR CARE COURT IS THAT IS IT SO IT'S NOT IN THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL AS EARLY AS AT FAULT STILL MAYBE STILL UNCERTAIN BUT LEASES YOUR COMMITMENT TO- PERMITTED TO COVER THAT. YOU KNOW THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES BY COUNTIES- IT WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE STATE OF THE DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNTIES ARE IN REGARDS TO- BE SURE THAT COUNTIES YEAH COUNTY APRIL HEALTH AND- OTHER AGENCIES THAT- THERE CAN BE AN ACT OF CARE COURT THAT- THAT THOSE ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED. CERTAINLY WE HAVE RECEIVED. FROM THE COUNTY SONORA WITH REGARDS TO- SOME ESTIMATES OF WHAT THOSE COUNTY COST MAY BE. HOWEVER WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE POLICY IS STILL. IN THE WORKS SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES UNTIL WE HAVE A- MORE SUCCINCT ESTIMATE. OKAY BUT THERE'S A COMMITMENT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE STILL TALKING SO WE DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS AND HOW MUCH YOU MIGHT GET DIVVIED BUT THERE'S A COMMITMENT FOR ON THE STATE PROVIDE LEAST- SOME SUPPORT FOR. COUNTY RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED COUNTY WORKLOAD OR EXPENSES RELATED TO CARE COURT. THEY'RE CERTAINLY DISCUSSIONS ARE BEING HAS SURROUNDING THE SPECIFIC COUNTY COSTS. OKAY I HEAR DISCUSSIONS AND YOUR COMMITMENT. SO WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING INTO THESE I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER WE HAVE NECESSARILY AGREEMENTS ON ALL THE COSTS AT THIS TIME BUT WAS CERTAINLY GOING TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH OUR. I GET THAT THERE'S VERY ARE IT IS IN ANY AGREEMENT YET AND I'M JUST AND I KNOW THERE'S A STILL A MOVING TARGET SO I APPRECIATE THAT SO I GUESS I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT I HOPE THAT IF WE'RE GONNA BE SIX- AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL. AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE AN INCREASED WORKLOAD THAT THAT DOES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR GRANT.

GOOD MORNING SENATOR EGGMAN THIS IS SONYA WTH THE LAW ANALYST- THE LATTER GROUP WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE DETAILS- SOME OF WHICH WERE JUST RECENTLY POSTED SO WE- WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS TODAY ON THOSE BUT WILL WORK WITH THE- WITH US WILL PASS IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CORY HAS TO HOWEVER FOR COMMENTS ON THE FIRST PROPOSALS REGARDING YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SHIDA. THANK YOU. SENATOR EGGMAN HIS SHEET WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE JUST HAVE AN OVER ARCHING COMMENT ABOUT THE FUNDING BEING PROPOSED FOR VARIOUS- ADDITIONAL CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE GRANT PROGRAMS- WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER HOW EXISTING FUNDING WITHIN THE- CHILDREN AND YOU CAN AND SHOULD HAVE COULD BE LEVERAGED TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THE GOALS OF THIS NEW FUNDING- MUCH OF THE EXISTING FUNDING WITHIN THE INITIATIVE HAS NOT BEEN DISTRIBUTED YET- AND WITHIN THE EXISTING INITIATIVE THERE ARE- SEVERAL GRANT PROGRAMS FOCUSED. ON TOPICS THAT YOU KNOW SEEM TO AT LEAST IN PART OVERLAP WITH- SOME OF THE PRIORITIES THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING- FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE GRANT PROGRAMS- THAT ARE IN THE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE CURRENT INITIATIVES THAT. ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING SORT OF SERVICES AND SCHOOLS AND DEVELOPING OUT WORKFORCE- IF THOUGH GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WISHES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE NEW INVESTMENTS. WE WOULD SUGGEST DISTRIBUTING'S NEWLY PROPOSED GRANT DOLLARS THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF THE EXISTING CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE PROGRAMS. OF TO HELP INSURE MORE STREAMLINED IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION AND- MORE SPEEDY DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS UP THAT THOSE ARE ALL THE COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT THE RESTAURANT IS IT. ARE WE ARE THIS IS NEW MONEY THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT ARE THESE. NEW PER. OR WE CONTINUE TO. TO FILL OUT ALL THE ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS ALL THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE WISH WE START SETTING UP LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE. THE FOR ADDITIVE. THESE ARE ADDED TO THE C. Y. B. H. I. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO- DEFER TO MY AGENCY. COUNTERPARTS THANKS TO FROM THE AGENCY ONE SPEAK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BRENDAN MCCARTHY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE CVS'S ADDITIVE TO THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE I'M IS YOU KNOW THE CHILDREN HE HEALTH BUT BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE IS REALLY ABOUT BUILDING A- STRUCTURE FOR PROVIDING A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY GENEROUS WITH INVESTMENT MADE LAST YEAR. BUT IT WILL TAKE US TIME TO BUILD UP THE SYSTEM IN THE SCHOOLS WITH THE PLATFORM- AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS POLICY IS RESPOND TO THE ISSUES WE HAVE SEEN THE DATA WE'VE SEEN ABOUT USE SUICIDE RISK. INCREASES IN HOSPITALIZATIONS. ACT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM STAKEHOLDERS- YOU KNOW TELLING US THAT THE INVESTMENTS IN THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVES ARE CRITICAL BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THEM TO WRAP UP. AND THEIR IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND SO WHAT WE TRIED TO DO HERE IS ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS. THAT WE ARE SEEING. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM FINANCE- SAID. WHILE ALSO- BUT- TACKLING SOME NEW ISSUES THAT ARE KIND OF EMERGING THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS FOR EXAMPLE. LEVERAGING EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE WANT TO LOOK AT AND RESEARCH WHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE ON THE HORIZON THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUILD INTO THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THEY HAVE A HEALTH ISSUE OVER TIME NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT AS THEY EMERGE HOW CAN WE BUILD THEM INTO THAT PROCESS- AND THEN THE PROPOSAL FOR SUPPORT FOR CULTURALLY DIVERSE. FUTURE WORK FORCE. BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE PROGRAMS FOR NOW THAT REALLY REACH DOWN INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL TO ENCOURAGE. PEOPLE TO GO INTO THE SESSIONS AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO ADD ON AS A KIND OF WELCOME MORE LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS SO THAT THERE WILL BE. A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE THERE I TO MEET OUR NEEDS THROUGH THE CHILDREN. HAVE FOR. INSTANCE MY OF THE CRISIS RESPONSE THE WELLNESS IN MIND FOR. THESE ARE ALL TO BE GREAT FUNDED AND IN SO HOW HOW HOW SOON WOULD WE EXPECT THAT MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT AND I'M THINKING THOSE ARE GOING TO NONPROFITS THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE WHERE ARE THOSE GRANTS GOING. YES YOUR YOUR CORRECT MADAM CHAIR SO ON HE USED TO ASIDE- PILOT PROGRAMS THOSE ARE MOST LIKELY GO TO COUNTIES WHO THEN COULD PARTNER WITH SCHOOLS AND- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT MONEY FOR A WELLNESS AND RESILIENCE- FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND PARENTS THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT WOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE SCHOOLS WE MAY ALSO WORK WITH CBO'S BUT THE IDEA IS REALLY TO KIND OF THE SCHOOL FOCUSED. PROGRAM THAT WERE IN CONCERT WITH- RESOURCES THAT WERE PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET IS THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM- AND SO FAR HOPE THERE IS TO GET THAT MONEY OUT THE DOOR A FAIRLY QUICKLY- AS AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK THROUGH THE CHILDREN USED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUE OF MAKING CONNECTIONS WITH THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY AND CBO'S SO WE THINK WE'VE LAID SOME GROUNDWORK BUT- WE HOPE THAT. BECAUSE OF BACKGROUND WORK WE CAN GET THESE GRANT FUNDS OUT THE DOOR RELATIVELY QUICK TO ADDRESS THESE PROJECTS AND THEN THE VIDEO SERIES THAT WERE IN DEVELOP FOR PARENTS OF THE CONTRACT FOR THAT OR HER SECOND THAT WORK. THE MOST LIKELY WE WOULD CONTRACT OUT SO THERE IS MONEY IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET ANSWERING FOR HIS NATION THAT HAS DEVELOPED SOME VIDEOS ON PRIMARILY AIMED AT EDUCATORS.

IS. THE STORE THIS PURPOSE SO WHAT'S THE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK ON ON ON THESE PROPOSAL SO I MEAN CERTAINLY IN YOUR DESCRIPTION SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS BUT- IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN.

ALL RIGHT SO SOUNDS LIKE TO STILL WORK TO BE DONE WHAT'S ON THIS PROPOSAL ALL RIGHT- I GUESS THE OTHER ONE I JUST ALSO WANT AND THE CHIN SO I APPRECIATE THAT WERE ELIMINATING AB NINETY SEVEN PROVIDER RATE REDUCTIONS WHICH GO BACK TO THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWENTY ELEVEN FOR SEVERAL SERVICES. THEY THOUGHT ABOUT- WELL OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT IN THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL BUT- YOU KNOW. COMMUNITIES WERE- IN SOME WAYS THESE AGAIN THESE ARE STILL RATE REDUCTIONS THEY HAVE GONE BACK TO THE GREAT RECESSION AND THEY'LL AND I. THAT WHEN I CAME IN WITH A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT IT'S GREAT TO SEE WE HAVE A- NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS EFFECTIVE FIGURE SURPLUS IS LARGER THAN THE TOTAL STATE BUDGET WHEN I FIRST CAME IN- IS THERE ANY THOUGHT TO TRYING. TO LIMIT RATE REDUCTIONS FOR SOME OF THE OTHER. THINGS THAT STILL APPLIES TO- SINCE THIS THESE ARE CUTS MADE DUE TO THE BUDGET STRESSES IN THE GREAT RECESSION. SURE I MEAN THE DEPARTMENT PUT FORWARD IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A LIST OF WHAT WE CONSIDERED SOME OF THE TOP PRIORITIES IN REGARDS TO AB NINETY SEVEN- OF- AND THEN THROUGH THE MAY REVISION THE ADDITIONAL ONES ADDED REALLY WORK TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE NOT ARE MOVING FORWARD FUTURE REDUCTIONS ON AB NINETY SEVEN FOR NEW BENEFITS THAT HAD BEEN ADDED LAST YEAR. UNDER PROPOSED THIS YEAR- WE STILL HAVE A PRETTY LONG LIST JUST TO BE FRANK IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF SERVICES THAT I'M STILL HAVE THE AB NINETY SEVEN REDUCTION APPLY TO THEM I'M SO MUCH I MORE. IN REGARDS TO HOW THAT WOULD BE SUPPORT FOR ONGOING COSTS AT THIS TIME THE IT. HAS PUT FORWARD THE PER FOR THE- COVERS BUDGET ITEMS THEN I ENSURING THAT NEW ITEMS ARE NOT A MAINTAINING THAT THOSE CUTS MOVING FORWARD AS WELL- ALL RIGHT. I JUST CAN BY MAKING THAT REIMBURSEMENT OR PAYMENT WHICH LEAD TO. ISSUES AND APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BUT THIS IS NOW. ELEVEN YEARS LATER WITH A- LITTLE LUCK NO THE MUCH BETTER BUDGET. I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS ALSO- IT'S NOT REALLY IN THE MAY REVISE ALTHOUGH AGAIN THERE'S NO FUNDING THROUGH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WITHOUT PROTECTION SOME OF THIS WE GET TO SEE PH AS WELL SO IN TERMS OF COVERT RESPONSE. I WE KNOW I KNOW OUR SCHOOLS ARE. HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF FUNDING ON CODE RESPONSE RIGHT TO TRY TO KEEP SCHOOLS SAFE KEEP THEM OPEN AND SO FORTH. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO HELP THEM MAXIMO. MEDIC CAL L. E. A. F. MA FUNDING THAT THEY CAN GET THROUGH MEDIC CAL- TO HELP THEM. SUPPORT AND- FINANCE- SENSUALLY- HEALTH MEASURES THAT THE NEED TO TAKE IN SCHOOLS TO KEEP COVERED UNDER CONTROL CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT- SO THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE DID DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. DIFFICULT TO ENSURE THAT WE HELP OUR SCHOOLS AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL THE SERVICES NEEDED ON SITE OF FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE ABLE TO GET HIM ASKED TO APPROVE THE CARVING OUT OF ALL OF THE TESTING ONSITE AT SCHOOL TO BE REIMBURSED DIRECTLY TO MEDIC HOW. ON THE FOR SERVICE SO THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CONTRACTING WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS ANOTHER HE SAYS- BUT AS LONG AS THE INDIVIDUAL WAS MEDIC HOW ELIGIBLE THAT THEY CAN BILL AND BE REIMBURSED FOR ALL OF THE ON SITE SCHOOL TESTING I THAT IS STILL IN PLACE IN PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET TO CONTINUE- I'M ALSO WAS INCLUDED IN OUR- UNWINDING PLAN THAT WAS RELEASED. ON TUESDAY OF THIS WEEK- ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING A NUMBER OF ITEMS IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ONLY EIGHT IN REGARDS TO HOW TO MAXIMIZE VARIOUS FUNDING AND WE'VE MADE A NUMBER OF MODIFICATIONS AND GUIDANCE CONTINUE TO PART WITH PARTNER WITH THEM IN REGARDS TO HOW THEY CAN BE MAXIMIZING. OF THAT FUNDING AND OR NEW INDIVIDUALS JOINING THAT FUNDING STREAM I TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES I'M SO HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH THEM. OKAY YEAH BECAUSE I THINK TRAIL PRIOR TO COPE WITH THE REPORTS ABOUT HOW ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW TRYING TO FEDERAL FUNDS RALLY A WE WILL ACTUALLY. SOME WAYS SIMILAR TO OUR PER PUPIL SPENDING WE ARE ALSO VERY LOW AND COMPARED TO OTHER STATES IN TERMS OF WHAT WE PULL DOWN ON L. EA NUMBER GARCIA THE TESTING- NOW IF I RECALL CORRECTLY APPROXIMATELY HALF OF ALL CHILDREN. ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT ROUGHLY HALF OF ALL THAT MEDIC CAL'S ACTUALLY FUNDING THE TESTING IN SCHOOLS FOR ROUGHLY HALF OF ALL THE STUDENTS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE- IN TERMS OF HOW IS YOUR DOING YOU KNOW AS AS- IT IS YOUR- CUT YOUR COVERING TESTING COSTS FOR. FOR SCHOOL STUDENTS. ARE IT IS A MORE THAN THAT ARE IS IT IS IT SERVE AND WHY WITH THE PERCENTAGES OF CHILDREN. WHO ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL. THAT'S A YORKER WE CURRENT COVER- APPROX. 5255% ON WHO. A IN THAT. TOTAL OF CHOI. IN MEDIKAL CROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK DOMINANTLY ONE THING THAT WOULD NOTICES THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDS PROVIDED IN REGARDS TO TESTING AFFECTS THE ON SITE FOR SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS OTHER FUNDS. HOWEVER WE HAVE HAD- CLAIMS COMING INTO US WITH MAINTAINED- THAT WITHIN THE BUDGET FOR. ALLOWING FOR THAT REIMBURSEMENT- AND WE DO KNOW THAT AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STARTS YOU AND SOME THEIR FINANCING. IT WILL BE CRITICAL THAT WE KEEP THAT AVAILABLE FOR ON THE SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TESTING AT THAT SO. WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHOOSE A AND TO BE ABLE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THOSE SERVICES AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET TO CONTINUE THAT. ONSITE SCHOOL TESTING FOR MEDIC CAL AT THE END OF THIS YEAR OKAY I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND THIS THIS- COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE PASSED THE FEDERAL STATE OF EMERGENCY. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU- OKAY. WELL I MEAN- WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON SOME OTHER. LATER ON THAT DAY AND- I KNOW OF DIFFERENT ITEMS HERE- AND- ALSO- AND- PUTTING LIKE A CALLIONYMUS. SELF ALL RIGHT WHAT JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT THANK YOU BILLIONS NOW EASILY HUNDREDS OF THEM OKAY.

WE AND OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELLO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. O. I'M WE ARE STILL REVIEWING MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS AND THE VARIOUS DETAILS FOR TODAY I'M GOING TO LIMIT MY COMMENTS TO- THE FIRST ITEM CONCERNING COBIT SPENDING AND IN PARTICULAR ONE COMPONENT OF THAT PROPOSAL- AS- AS OF MY FINANCE COLLEAGUES NOTED THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO SHIFT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO A NEW OFFICE. WITHIN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO SUPPORT KOBE NINETEEN VACCINE RELATED PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS APPROACH. WE BELIEVE THAT SHIFTING THIS RESPONSIBILITY- PARTICULARLY WHILE THE PANDEMIC REMAINS ONGOING COULD DELAY THE DISSEMINATION OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON VACCINES AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES. AND MOREOVER- WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE SHIFT COULD RESULT IN SORT OF DUPLICATION AND- MIXED MESSAGING AND AVOIDING THESE KINDS OF OUTCOMES BEEN- WE THINK ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE MISSED MISTER MIL MISTER TELL AND THAT ARE THAT ARE AVAILABLE BE ABLE ANSWER THAT QUESTION ABOUT THE- THE WISDOM OF THAT AT THE NEW AGE DOING THIS FIRST. THE PROGRAMS ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE. CERTAINLY I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND. THE REGARD THE FIRST CAN- A DELAY OF INFORMATION SHARING SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASSEMBLING TRANSITION TEAM THAT INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO SUPPORT THIS MAY TRANSFER OF THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF CODE NINETEEN OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION IS FINALIZING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PROVIDE STATUTORY GUIDELINES FOR ACTUATING THE TRANSFER OR CURRENT CONTRACTING DUTIES FROM CITY PAGE OVER TO THE NEW OFFICE. I'M IN REGARDS TO THE SECOND QUESTION- IN TERMS OF DUPLICATION OF ACTIVITIES ON WE WILL KNOW THAT WE DO RECOGNIZE THE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN AND I WOULD JUST MENTION THAT THE OFFICE IS BEING CREATED TO ADDRESS INEFFICIENCIES INCLUDING DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS WITHIN STATEWIDE OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS- ON THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES THAT OFFICIALLY BEGINS WILL BE REALIZED THROUGH INCREASED COORDINATION ACROSS DIFFERENT STATE ENTITIES AND HAVING ONE ORGANIZING. TO OVERSEE COMPLEX AND MULTI FACETED PROJECTS LIKE KOBE NINETEEN OUT REACH PROGRAM WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE OVERALL EFFICIENCIES OF OUR OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS- AND IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THE OFFICE ITSELF I WOULD TAKE THOSE BACK AND COORDINATE WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH ASSIGNMENTS THANK YOU AND SO WITH THIS. THIS THIS NEW TO AND WHAT IT ALL. DO THE DECEMBER ON LIKE THE ON THE NEXT PAGE MORE TALK ABOUT- SUICIDE OUTREACH PUBLIC WHERE OPIOID CAMPAIGNS LIKE ALL THE ALL THE CAMPAIGNS WE DO IS. BIGGER BROADER MULTI FACETED CONTAINS THAT OFTEN HAVE TOUCHES AND DEPARTMENTS SO AT THIS AT LEAST WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BROWN THE PRIMARY CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD BE SHIFTING OVER WOULD BE RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN VACCINATIONS. OKAY SO THEN COULD YOU ALSO SPEAK TO THE- BECAUSE WE ALREADY WENT OVER SOME THINGS UNDER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FOR CHILDREN BEHAVIOR YOUTH INITIATIVES. SUICIDE OUT REACH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT FEEL LIKE THEY WERE THEY ALSO LIVE IN DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT APARTMENTS AND I UNDERSTAND DIFFERENT AGENCIES DO DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT ARE WE ARE WE ASSURED OF THAT THAT LEVEL OF COORDINATION. ARE YOU SPEAKING IN REGARDS TO SORT OF LIKE BROAD BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSALS CORRECT THAT THIS ONE THE SUICIDE ONE. HE WAS ONE OF THE ONE THAT WE JUST CAN'T FOR YOUTH THAT A HIGH LEVEL THAT IS THE ROLE THAT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY HAS TAKEN ON BUT WOULD ALSO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES. EITHER AT AGENCY OR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH YOU ADD ON TO THAT. AND I THINK I SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE CHILDREN YOUTH SUICIDE PREVENTION OF FORTY MILLION. I THINK I'M WAITING FOR THAT ONE I WOULD WANT TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD. REGARDING THE SUICIDE- GRANT PROGRAMS. APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO CLARIFY ON THE FORTY MILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM. READ IT WHEN YOU'RE WITH US WITH THE DEPARTMENT RITA. I UNDERSTANDING THAT FAR- HADN'T CLARIFIED WHETHER THAT. WORK WOULD BE HAPPENING WITH BECAME ACTED. OUT LEVEL DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY. CAN YOU REPEAT THAT ARE IN HERE YOU. OKAY NOW I CAN REVIEW COORDINATE ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND THEN CONTINUE I WOULD BE FIVE HUNDRED WHILE AND WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY FURTHER INSTRUCTION THAT IT MIGHT BE MOVING OUT OF CDPH SO WE'VE BEEN OPERATING UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT. SIDE CAMPAIGN WOULD BE LOOKING EACH. OKAY OKAY LET'S LET'S JUST LET'S JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COORDINATING AND THEN ON THE ON THE A DEBT PROGRAM ARE WE SAYING THAT THE COST WENT UP BECAUSE OF THE OVER FIFTY MEDICAL EXPANSION. THAT WOULD I HEARD. SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT NOTHING BECAUSE WHEN UP BECAUSE OF THE OVERHEAD THE EXPANSION IT'S THAT PATENT OWNERS BUDGET WE OVER PROJECTED POTENTIAL SAVINGS AS A RESULT THE BECAUSE SAVINGS HAVE GONE DOWN OUR COSTS WITH THEREFORE GO UP A LITTLE BIT. OKAY BUT BECAUSE OF THE OVER FIFTY. EXPANSION IT IN THIS PROGRAM AND SPECIFICALLY A DEATH. RIGHT AND I THINK JUST BROKE TO CLARIFY OVERALL WE'RE SEEING A REDUCTION IT'S JUST COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AT THAT POINT IN TIME MEASURE WE'RE SEEING A SLIGHT INCREASE THAT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I THINK MIKE PENCE. THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL SIR TO GO BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE- I GUESS NEED THIS AT THE MOMENT THE OFFICE AND SO FORTH- THAT DOES OUTREACH- AND CERTAINLY HERE THE L. A. AS CONCERNS BUT AT IF I RECALL CORRECTLY AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG- WE I AND I KNOW THAT I BROUGHT IT UP BEFORE EARLIER ON IN THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE WE HAD INVESTED ACTUALLY IN A LOT OF. A COMMUNITY OUTREACH FOR THE CENSUS FOR TWENTY TWENTY RIGHT. AND THE CENSUS OUTREACH AND I AND I KNOW THAT I HAD. MADE MENTION AND- SOUNDS AND I BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION THAT WELL AFTER WE BUILT THIS NETWORK FOR OUTREACH. TO COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE THIS PANDEMIC GOING ON WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO COMMUNITIES THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THE SKILLS THAT WE LEARNED OF THE CAPACITY THAT WE BUILD AND USE THAT TO HELP. ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC CAN COMMUNICATE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS NATIONS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. SO IS THIS IS THIS THE SORT OF THE TEAM AND CAPACITY I SHOULD SAY THAT WE'RE NOW. TALKING ABOUT MOVING TO IS IT IS AT THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH OR SOMETHING CAN- SO THAT THE IS IT IS THAT CORRECT. SO- YOUR POINT OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN JUST A COMMUNICATION ART OKAY. YEAH A LITTLE BIT OF A MOUTHFUL DIRECTION IS CORRECT YOU KNOW THE INTENT IS TO REALLY START LEVERAGING A LOT OF THE LESSONS WE'VE ALREADY LEARNED WHAT COMMUNITY. I'M REALLY MOBILIZING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WE ALREADY DEVELOPED OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT IN THE- I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE- I THINK IN TERMS OF. WORK WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS WANTED CHALLENGES YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY BIG STATE GOVERNMENT RIGHT WE HAVE A LOT OF AGENCIES AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS LIKE ONE AGENCY TRIES TO TALK TO YOU ANOTHER AGENCY AND- THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER AGENCY SAID RIGHT AND- AND SO FORTH AND- ESPECIALLY WE'RE TRYING TO. DELVE MORE DEEPLY INTO BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS- WE IT'S GOOD NOT TO HAVE TO ESSENTIALLY REBUILD RELATIONSHIP OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT AGENCIES DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND THAT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT YOU KNOW. BEING ABLE TO. HAVE A GROUP THAT. RAY HAS EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS HAS ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS THAT ALSO MIGHT EVEN HELP WITH THE COMMUNITY GROUPS. TO SAY THIS BUT PRIORITIZE- ARE AT LEAST BE PROVIDE REAL PRICEY BACK AS TO WHICH MESSAGES SO FORTH ARE RESONATING WITH PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES. I THINK DOES IT CAN BE HELPFUL SO AND SO TO ME THE I THINK THERE'S- SENSUALLY SOME ADVANTAGES BUT I DO APPRECIATE ALEJO'S POINT THAT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS BECOME SO SEPARATED FROM. THE GROUPS THAT NEED TO DO THE WORK FOR EXAMPLE CERTAINLY WITH CALVIN THE PANDEMIC AND CDPH. TO MEET NOT BE SO SEPARATED THAT BASICALLY WE START PUTTING BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS TO AGENCIES YOU NEED TO DO CAN BEOUT REACH. AT THE END BECAUSE IT'S IN A DIFFERENT. BOX IN THE- YOU KNOW IN THE ORGANIZATION CHART THAT- THAT IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO. TO USE THIS CAPACITY THAT WERE WERE TRYING TO REFINE- IN THIS NEW OFFICE. SO COULDN'T CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO- WHAT STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT AS THIS. A NEW ORGANIZATION WHICH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND LEAST. HOPEFULLY MY DESCRIPTIONS CORRECT IN TERMS OF THE PURPOSE REASON YOU MIGHT BE WANTING TO DO THIS- WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES IN PARTICULAR PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE I KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH AS A YOU KNOW A LOT OF THAT WORK HAS TO HAPPEN ON THE GROUND. IS GOING TO BE SURE TODAY HAVE SUFFICIENT. ACCESS TO THIS CAPACITY THAT WE'RE NOW MOVING OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY WHICH OTHER AGENCIES CAN ALSO USE. IT INTO A SEPARATE OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK- SO I WOULD JUST REITERATE AGAIN THAT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL TRANSFER THE ADMINISTRATION IS FINALIZING TRAILER BILL. THAT WOULD REALLY PROVIDE THE STATUTORY GUIDELINES FOR A FUNCTIONING THE TRANSFER- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK JUST TO KIND OF REITERATE SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS. DR PAN THE INTENT OF THE OFFICE IS TO FORMALIZE A LOT OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE STATE LIKE OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. TO HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS SUCH AS A COVERT NINETEEN CAMPAIGN ESPECIALLY AROUND VACCINATIONS- WE- YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS THERE TO BE MULTIPLE PROGRAMMATIC EFFICIENCIES WITHIN THE OFFICE AND REALLY THE GOAL IS TO. PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE DELIVERY BETTER OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I DON'T OVERALL GREATER CAPACITY TO GET INFORMATION TO REALLY WHO AND WHERE IT'S NEEDED THE MOST. IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND CDPH THEIR OFFICE- INTENDS TO CONTINUE COLLABORATION WITH CD. SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. TO DEVELOP MATERIALS WORK WITH LOCAL COUNTY AND VIDEOS. AND REALLY FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING THE CAMPAIGNS AS LOCAL NEED SHIFT DURING THE PANDEMIC SO I THINK THERE'S STILL. THE EXPECTATION THAT THERE WILL BE SOME LEVEL OF ONGOING COLLABORATION GIVING ON. THE TIME TO TRANSITION AND SORT OF STAND UP THE OFFICE WILL CONTINUE ENSURING THERE'S CONTINUITY OF THE CAMPAIGN OKAY. SO HOPEFULLY SOME MEANS HIGH LEVEL OF COOPERATION. AND THAT. OKAY THANK NOT. BUT YEAH. SO IT'S- I DID HAVE SOME QUESTION REGARDING THE- COBA DIREC SPONSOR X. BECAUSE JUST SAID ONE POINT BILLION AND- LIST SOME THINGS UNDER THERE SO DID DELVE INTO. A FEW MORE DETAILS I KNOW IN PAST BUDGET HEARINGS I'VE- MENTIONED AND BABY CAN. SPEAK WELL MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT THE VACCINATION RATES AND PARTICULARLY CHILDREN IS STILL FAIRLY LOW I THINK IT'S ONLY 36% FOR FIVE TO ELEVEN. FOR TEENAGERS IT'S AROUND TWO THIRDS WHICH IS BELOW THE SERVE EIGHTY PLUS PERCENT THAT WE HAVE FOR THE- OVERALL. FOR THE ADULT POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. AS A PEDIATRICIAN I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO GETTING THEIR VACCINES FROM THEIR DOCTOR. AND THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. SO IF I CALL AND- AND WE LEARNED THIS LESSON BY THE WAY WITH PRIOR VACCINES RIGHT SO BEFORE YOU KNOW BACK IN. THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES- WE HAD A LARGE MEASLES OUTBREAK IN LOS ANGELES- WHERE BECAUSE A LOT OF BECAUSE- SENSUALLY LAW THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS WERE NOT ACTUALLY PROVIDING VACCINES IN THE OFFICE THEY WOULD RECOMMEND THEMSELVES GO TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT GO SOMEWHERE ELSE HERE TO GET THE VACCINE. YOU KNOW MEDICAL COVERAGE BUT- IT WASN'T DELIVERED AT THE OFFICE THE VERY PLACE YOU GO NUTS YOU DON'T GET SENT TO A PHARMACY DON'T GET THE VACCINATIONS. YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE I MEAN JUST IN I GET THE VACCINE- OKAY LANCE QUESTIONS I WILL GIVE TO YOU RIGHT NOW WELL YOU'RE IN THE- THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO HAVE- DOING. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF. I AM A CARE. PARTICULARLY PEDIATRICIANS FOUND THE CARE OF CHILDREN CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER THE VACCINE IN THEIR OFFICE AT THE VERY TIME TO TALK TO THE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. NOT SEND THEM OFF TO A PHARMACY NOT OFF THE MASS VACCINATION NIGHTS AND THE MANY WHERE ELSE THEY CAN GIVE IT IN THE OFFICE. FOR THAT WHEN I WENT OUT THEM IF WHEN HE THE DOCTOR COUNTY DIRECTOR AND HE WE DO A SIX. AMOUNT OF MONEY FOCUS ON PROVIDING SMALL GRANTS TO PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS WE CONCLUDE AGREE WITH YOU IT'S AND LESS THAN FIVE IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT ENGAGING- PEDIATRICIAN ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE IN THE LOW INCOME SAID THE MARK OR ARE STATE NET SHOULD IS THAT IS ACTUALLY PART OF OURS OUR STRATEGY TO CLOSE- INCREASE INCREASE. IN THAT AGE GROUP OKAY SO I I'VE BEEN I THINK THE PRAYER TIME OF ALSO HEARD THE ANSWERS THAT WE HAVE GRANTS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE UPTAKE IS FOR THE GRANTS AND SO FORTH SO- HOPING YEAH SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS I DON'T HAVE THOSE. STATISTICS WITH ME RIGHT NOW BUT WE CAN GET YOU THOSE STATISTICS AND FALL OPEN OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I WOULD LET ME JUST PUT IT THIS WAY FROM THE TIME LINE. ISSUE- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. WHO ARE SHOWING UP IN THEIR DOCK OFFICE. IS JULY AND AUGUST BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE STARTING SCHOOL IN AUGUST SEPTEMBER. AND THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN AND THEY NEED TO GET THEIR VACCINATIONS FOR SCHOOLS. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR DOCTOR OR NURSE PRACTITIONER PA IS A BY THE WAY IN ADDITION YOU SHOULD GET YOUR CHILD THE COVER VACCINES. PARALEGAL OKAY YOU. AND SO- CAN I GET IT WITH THE OTHER VACCINES IT OF THE ANSWER IS WELL ACTUALLY WE CAN GIVE YOU THE OTHER ONES BUT YOU HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE RECOVERED BAXEEN. THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET IT JUST BECAUSE OF THE HASSLE NOT THAT THEY DON'T AGREE NOT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO IT CETERA. SO WE HAVE THAT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY THAT WE GOT IT YOU KNOW BETWEEN THE SENSUALLY JULY AND AUGUST AND IT'S READY AND OF. GETTING MID MAY. THAT WE ASK THE TEE IT UP BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW WE ARE BOTH SIDES OF PETERSON WE KNOW THAT'S THE SEASON IN WHICH PEOPLE COME IN AND GET THEIR VACCINES CAUGHT UP. AND SO- SO AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE- GETTING THAT INFORMATION BUT ALSO SOME URGENCY- IN IN TERMS OF BEING. GOT TO GETTING THOSE TEED UP- I GUESS THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE IS- IN RELATION TO A LONG CO BID- AND THE L- I THINK AND AGAIN WE DID A HEARING IN THE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH ON THIS- WHAT IS. CDPH DOING. IN TERMS OF- TRACKING LANCO BID- THE STUDIES THAT HAVE COME OUT SHOW THAT ACTUALLY EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE HOSPITALIZED WITH MILDER ASYMPTOMATIC. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LONG COVETED. THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE THAT ONE MILLION AMERICANS ARE OUT OF THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE ALONG CO THAT SYMPTOMS AT LEAST- YOU KNOW IN ENGLAND THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT A THIRD OF THEIR WORK FORCE. AT IS OUT BECAUSE OF SOME DISABILITY AND THAT THAT SPIKE BECAUSE A LONG KOVITZ THIS IS A MAJOR ACT. ISSUE AS WELL AS- A HEALTHY- SO WHAT IS C. N. AND I REALISED SOME CHALLENGES BECAUSE WE HAD OUR HEARING IN TERMS OF DEFINITIONS AND SO FORTH. BUT WHAT A CD FOR YEAH INVESTING IN TRYING TO TRACK LONG COATED- YES I YOU FOR THAT SO THERE'S SEVERAL AREAS THAT WERE FOR ON THE EURO. AND IT'S REALLY IT'S A IT'S EVEN BROADER IN THE IN THOSE YOU THINK OF JUST LONG KOBE RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHERS CALL I FROM CO ORANGE BEGINNING LEARN ABOUT. SO ONE IS THAT WE ARE PURCHASING WITH THE CDC AND FOR TO STUDY PERSONS WITH LONG COVE THE SECOND THING THEY WERE DOING IS THAT WORSE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND OTHER UNIVERSITIES SUCH AS STANFORD. AND IN REALLY BUILDING OUT OUR ABILITY TO COLLABORATE ON NEW RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT ALSO EXISTING RESEARCH PROJECTS COULD WE KNOW ACROSS CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING RESEARCH AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HARNESS ALL THAT A RESEARCH FINDINGS THAT ARE COMING OUT SO WE DO WE DO HAVE A MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO COORDINATE WITH YOU SEE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SHARE AND TO LEARN. AND THEN THE OTHER COMPONENT IS GOING TO BE WORKING WITH HEALTH ECONOMISTS SAY YOU A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HELPING OF THE PROJECT OVER THE AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF- ALL THESE CODED OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ANTICIPATING. GETTING THINGS LIKE TRYING TO SOME OF THE BE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACT- INTO THE FUTURE OF KOBE SO- YOUR TRYING TO WE'RE GOING TO BE WE ARE GOOD I'M GOING TO BE BUILDING A STRONG COLLABORATION TO REALLY HARNESS ALL THIS INFORMATION. OKAY AND- SINCE THIS IS A BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HOW MUCH MONEY I KNOW IT'S I DON'T SEE THIS IN THE REVISED PRODUCTION THERE MIGHT BEEN SOMETHING AND- SO HOW WHAT SO GREAT PEOPLE DOING THIS EVERYBODY. OUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE PUTTING INTO IT. INTO THIS AND IS THAT ENOUGH. YEAH I BELIEVE THE COMPOSED ON TOP ABOUT PART IS IN THE CASE THEN LOOKED. OF LOOKS IT HERE SURVEIL MEASURING THE OUTCOME SO. IMPROVING OR OR EVERY EMAIL OF THE DAY NOW ARE MORE. HOLD HOLD YOU KNOW SEQUENCE. WAIT WHILE WASTEWATER SURVEIL. AND SO MANY IN THERE ALSO TO DO THE CLUB. WITH OF. OKAY PART OF THE THAT'S PART OF IT IT WOULDN'T PACKAGE WHOLE PACKAGE. IS SIXTEEN MILLION. OKAY ARE WELL- SB GOOD IF WE CAN BREAK OUT THE LONG CODE PORTION BUT IT'S A FRACTION THAT SIXTEEN MILLION I WONDER WHETHER THAT'S ENOUGH- WE- NO WE AGREE WITH YOU ARE THE WAY THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT IT IS REALLY SITUATING- OURSELVES. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. WE ANTICIPATE MORE FUNDING WILL BE COMING DOWN- TO DO READ JUST SO WE'RE WE'RE WE WANT TO BE IN A GOOD POSITION TO GO AFTER- THOSE GRANT FUNDS WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. OKAY AND THEN AGAIN AS I SAID WE KNOW THERE IS RESEARCH HAPPENING. CALIFORNIA AND ALSO NATIONALLY AND BEING BEING ABLE TO BEING ABLE TO TAKE. MY NEEDS AND INTEGRATED INTO POLICYMAKING ALL RIGHT WELL MIKE MY CONCERN IS. WHY APPRECIATE THEIR MAYBE CAN'T FUNDING COMING. WERE RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER SPIKE THAT'S HAPPENING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE GET INFECTED AND RE INFECTED. AND THAT WE DON'T START COLLECTING. THE DATA NOW. AND HAVE THE RE TO DO THAT- WE'RE GONNA BE MISSING. HELLO OF IT. NOW WE ALWAYS GET TRIED GET TO LAY BUT RIGHT. WE HAVE PEOPLE GETTING WITH LOTS OF RE INFECTIONS AS WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT OUR CRIMES GET INFECTED DEMOCRAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WON'T GET RE INFECTED. APPARENTLY DOESN'T PROVIDE MUCH PROTECTION GETTING INFECTED FROM ACROSS AND GETTING RE INFECTED- AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT'S ON THE DATA CURRENTLY DATA SHOWING- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE GET MORE INFECTIOUS OF VARIANTS. AND WE NEED TO BE CAPTURING- WHO'S INFECTED AND THEN IF THEY DEVELOP LONG COVE IT SOMETIME SO WE GET AT MORE ACCURATE DATA- LONG COBIT ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW AND WITH EACH VARIANT THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW IMPACTS IN TERMS OF- ON LONG COAT AND IT OF COURSE. THE IMPACT OF VACCINATION ALLOW CODED WILL CERTAINLY- STUDIES SHOW THAT IT REDUCES LONG COVERED PRIVATE ABOUT HALF BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. SO SO I I'M JUST SAYING THAT WHILE THERE MAY BE GRANT ON THE WAY WE SHOULD BE PUTTING SOME FUNDING TO BE SURE WE CAN GET AHEAD OF THOSE THAT BECOMES PILE I GET THAT BECOMES DATA THAT CAN BE FOLDED INTO FUTURE GRANT PROJECTS BUT- I DON'T BE SITTING HERE A YEAR LATER GOING- WELL WE JUST GOT A GREAT AND NOW WHOLE YEAR'S OF P. GET HUNG CO AND AN WE'RE BY. YEAH SO- I THINK TO- JUST IN. SO ABOUT THAT SAY IS. WITH US BUT THE BUDGET BUT JUST. THE EXPENDITURE OVERSEE. FOR SO WE HAVE WITH CALLED THE SEEK. OKAY SO IS THERE ARE A LOT OF. HAS BEEN IN THAT. IN COLLABORATIVE OR- WITH THE CAR. OF UC HEALTH- THERE'S THAT THERE ISN'T TO REALLY BIG. ALL RIGHT THE EXAM AND I D. SO. THAT IN INDIA WHAT YOU'RE- AND SO THE BEES. ADDITIONAL I MEANT SIXTY MILLION IS THAT ADDITION TO. THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WERE ALREADY EXPANDING ON COVERT HELPFUL TO HAVE A- PICTURE OF THAT- EXACTLY WHAT THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE AND WHAT RESOURCES WE'RE PUTTING INTO IT SO. I APPRECIATE THAT. YEAH DON'T WE CAN GO TO. WOULD BE IT WOULD BE BE ON WHAT THE BUDGET HEARING IS ABOUT LEADERSHIP WEEK WE CAN SUMMARIZE THOSE OKAY RIGHT. OBVIOUSLY YOU BUDGET WILL BE SURE WE ENOUGH RESOURCES STATE RESOURCE OF PUTTING IT OKAY. AND THEN THE ISSUE I KNOW YOU TALK TO DEEDS. OF CAL ELSE. AND HOW MANY OKAY LEAST COVER PROBABLY OF THE TEST- GIVEN THAT HAVE TO SEE. ARE FOOT THE FIFTY FIFTH FIVE PER BUT WE HAVE THE OTHER HALF. AND YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT PARENTS KNOW WE TALK ABOUT LOVE COVET PARENTS PARENTS WANT TO KNOW IF THE KIDS MIGHT GET INFECTED OR EXPOSED THEY MAY HAVE. AT RISK FAMILY MEMBERS AT HOME WITH THEIR CHILD NOT AT RISK. AND US SO WE CAN ADD THAT ONE POINT ONE BILLION. ARE WE LOOKING AT- BE ABLE CONTINUE FIND TESTING- PROGRAMS AND SCHOOLS TO BE SURE WE DON'T HAVE. TO LIMIT OUTBREAKS ARE- INFECTIONS OF CHILDREN. AND YOUTH IN SCHOOLS- YES. ARE TESTING. VERY REAL BUS A BIGGER DIFFERENCE. HAS BEEN AWAY FOR PC AVAIL AND- MADE ME IT REALLY IMPACTS RAINBOWS. OF AND FAMILIES TO HAVE A- TO INTO. TEST WELL- SO YEAH THERE'S OF.

AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT MAKES CERTAINLY HAS PRESENTED A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES FOR US THAT THE DEPARTMENT- AND THE DEPARTMENTS AKE AND NUMBER OF ACTIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS YOU KNOW IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY PROVIDED A LOT OF GUIDANCE AND I'M TO US AS ME IMPLEMENTED R. AND COMING NINETEEN KIND OF INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS AND- REALLY IMPROVED- THE COPING. NOT ONLY BEEN WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS THAT REALLY CHANGE THE OPERATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT QUITE A BAD IN AND AS WE SEEING ITS IMPACT ON OUR INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL SOLUTIONS WAIT LIST AS WELL- BUT IT IS- ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW I WAS B. AS THE PANDEMIC SURGES IN THE COMMUNITY WE CERTAINLY. FEEL THAT SURGE WITHIN OUR HOSPITALS AS WELL BUT WE HAD- AS SEEN THAT LESSON OVER TRYING AS FAR AS KIND OF. THAT REALLY- THE HEALTH IMPACTS THAT WERE SEEN AS FAR OUT AS YOU KNOW AS SIGNIFICANT- ILLNESS AS A RESULT O THE OVE AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE DO. HAVE A HAVING A HIGH RATE OF VACCINATION WITHIN BOTH OF OUR PATIENTS AND STAFF OVER 80% FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND STAFF. AND WE HAVE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE ACCESS TO THERAPEUTICS- WE HAVE YOU KNOW- STRONG INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS SO. IT CERTAINLY IS A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE SOMEWHAT WE EXPERIENCE EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC BUT IT'S DEFINITELY WITH EACH VARIANT THAT COMES THROUGH I KNOW AND EXPERIENCE AND REQUIRES ADJUSTMENTS TO WHAT WE'RE DOING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO- THE NEW. CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES. THANK YOU FOR W. NOW I THINK THAT KIND OF THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU MUCH OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TOBY YOU IN ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION- WE HAVE IN THE MAY REVISE ONE ITEM. THAT IS REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT A TECHNICAL ISSUE IN THE WAY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE STATE TRACKS POSITIONS AND SO THAT ITEM IS TO REDUCE BY SIX POSITIONS JUST TO ADDRESS AN OVERSIGHT IN TERMS OF HOW WE TRACK POSITIONS. IN ADDITION TO THAT ITEM THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS FIVE PROPOSALS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISE THAT WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. PLEASE THANK YOU. SO FIRST THE COMMISSION WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO MODIFY THE PROVISIONS OF SB EIGHTY TWO SB TEACH YOU YOU MAY RECALL. IS A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR YOUR GRANT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CRISIS RESPONSE FUNDING TO COUNTIES. THAT THE PARAMETERS OF THAT PROGRAM AT THE MOMENT RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO USE THOSE FUNDS SIMPLY TO PROVIDE PERSONNEL GRANTS TO COUNTY'S. AGAIN PRIMARILY FOR CRISIS RESPONSE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTIES WE'VE LEARNED. THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AROUND CRISIS PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. AND AS PART OF THAT WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE USE OF THOSE DOLLARS TO FOCUS ON MORE UPSTREAM OPPORTUNITIES. TO EXPAND THE USE OF THOSE DOLLARS TO WORK WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF PARTNERS CURRENTLY THE FUNDING CAN ONLY BE GRANTED THE COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN CRISIS PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL. EXPANSIONS USE THOSE FUNDS FOR THINGS OTHER THAN PERSONALITY RANTS AND AS PART OF THAT TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE DOLLARS MORE FLEXIBLY IN SOME INSTANCES. I REQUIREMENTS IN GRANTS WHICH IS NOT CURRENTLY ALLOWED AND IN VERY LIMITED INSTANCES TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE THESE DOLLARS THROUGH NON COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENTS ESPECIALLY FOR WORKING WITH VERY SMALL COUNTIES AND SMALL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT QUITE FRANKLY REALLY STRUGGLE TO PARTICIPATE IN COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT PROCESSES. SO THAT'S OUR FIRST REQUEST IS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THE TRAIN OF A LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW MODIFICATIONS OF THE SPD TO YOUR- PROGRAM IN THOSE WAYS. MEDITATE QUESTIONS OR JUST GO TO THE OTHER REMAINING ITEMS- HIS CLEAR THE REMAINING ITEMS I THINK. THANK YOU. AS AS YOU I THINK YOU KNOW HOW OVER THE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE AUTHORIZED THE COMMISSION TO. RELEASE FUNDS FOR STAKEHOLDER ADVOCACY FOR TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF OUR PARTNERS AS PEERS. FOR AT. TO GET THREE INCH OR TO ADDRESS THIS AROUND THE- SERVETTE FORENSICS. I'M COMMISSION IS ASKING A NEW FIVE. FIRST TO STRENGTHEN OUR OB. TO THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS OF EMMA AND- TO ADVOCATES. HELLO YOU KNOW SEEN IN. OF BOTH INTO. IN OUR IMMIGRANT IF YOU COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO AN ESCALATION OF NEEDS PARTICULARLY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AFGHANISTAN AND UKRAINE AND SO THE COMMISSION WOULD LIKE TO DOUBLE FUNDING FOR IT TO SUPPORT OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE DOING OUTREACH EDUCATION TRAINING AND ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. SIMILARLY WITH THE TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ELEVATE THE VOICES YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS WERE MAKING. AROUND SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH ACTUALLY ARE FORMED BY YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO SERVE. THERE'S THAT EVIDENCE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE COMING TOGETHER TO REALLY INFORM THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THESE LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE COMMISSION SEES AN OPPORTUNITY. TO FURTHER THOSE THOSE PATHWAYS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BEST RESPOND TO THEIR NEEDS. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND AGAIN THAT'S THE STANDARD LEVEL OF FINDING THE COMMISSION LEASES THROUGH THESE GRANT PROGRAMS. AND THAT WOULD FOCUS ON STAKEHOLDER SUPPORTER OUR PARTNER SUPPORT- WITH EMPHASIS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN A POSITION ONE POSITION TO HELP IMPLEMENT THOSE. PROGRAMS OVER TIME. OUR OUR THIRD RECORD. IS REALLY TIGHT THE PRIME THAT STATE MADE IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH PEERS. I IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THE STATE HAS IT IS WORKING TO CERTIFY THE ROLE OF PEERS IN OUR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE'RE SEEING. A GREAT ACCEPTANCE AND EXPANSION OF THE ROLE OF PEERS ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SIDE. WE ALSO SEE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO EMBRACE THE ROLE OF PEERS IN TERMS OF. BRINGING MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS INTO CONVERSATIONS AROUND HOW WE DESIGN SHAPE FUND AND DELIVER PROGRAMS. AND SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HIS SUPPORT TO WORK WITH THE CALENDAR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES. TO REALLY EXPLORE HOW THE STATE COULD EMBRACE A LEADERSHIP ROLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS AS PART OF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT STATE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT. OF THE KINDS OF PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE SO WE'RE ASKING FOR. LANGUAGE TO DIRECT THAT WORK AS WELL AS SOME STAFF AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO SPEND THE NEXT FEW YEARS REALLY FIGURING OUT HOW CALIFORNIA CAN. TRULY EMBRACE APPEARS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO ADDRESS NO HEALTH NEEDS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR OUR FOURTH PROPOSAL IN. IS SIMILAR TO A LITTLE BIT THERE BUT SIMILAR. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN FOR YOU MANY TIMES YOU WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE USE DATA. HOW WE ARE TRYING TO TRANSITION FUNDING AWAY FROM AUGMENTING KIND OF CLASSIC ADDITIONAL FUNDS TOWARDS INCENTIVE FUNDS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO BUILD OUT LEARNING COMMUNITIES AROUND EARLY PSYCHOSIS AROUND USED PROPERTY AROUND SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH- WE'RE WE'RE SUPPORTING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO THINGS LIKE PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FIND IS MUCH OF THIS WORK IS VERY DIFFICULT TO IT FOR A LOCAL PARTNERS TO ENGAGE WITH- QUITE OFTEN OUR LOCAL AGENCIES ARE SHARING WITH US. THAT THEY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR TRAINING AND GUIDANCE AMOUNT AROUND HOW THEY TOO CAN BE MORE PERFORMANCE ORIENTED- WHAT KINDS OF RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AND SO SOME OF THE FINE THAT YOU PROVIDED US IN THE PAST HAVE ALLOWED US. TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF TRAINING WE'RE ASKING FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO ACTUALLY LAUNCH BEHAVIOR HEALTH PERFORMANCE FELLOWSHIP. IT WOULD BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR COUNTY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. BUILDING OFF OF WORK AT THE STATE HAS DONE IN THE PAST THAT LOOKS MORE BROADLY AT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BUT IN THIS INSTANCE REALLY FOCUSES ON THE CORE CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE IN OUR HERO HEALTH COMMUNITY. AT SO THAT WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. TO REALLY DO THE DATA WORK TO DO THE ANALYSIS TO RECOGNIZE COST DRIVERS TO MAKE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF IMAGES INNOVATION FINDS. SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS LAUNCH FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN CREATE A FELLOWSHIP WORK WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. AND IT AS WELL THIS WOULD BE FOUND IN A UNIVERSITY THAT HAS A- HISTORY THESE ARE INTENT. I WORKING IN THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SPACE AND THE IDEAS THAT OVER THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX YEARS. THAT FUNDING WOULD ACTUALLY SHIP FROM THIS ONE TIME- DOLLARS THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR TOWARDS REVENUE BASED- I REVENUE THAT THAT THAT THE PROBLEM GENERATED THROUGH CHARGING TUITION FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE FELLOWSHIP. AND ALLOW. IS INCREASE THE COME IS THAT TO COME. ON FOR. AND WHEREAS FOR POSITION TO ALLOW US TO ADD A LEGISLATIVE LIAISON WHO CAN HELP US SUPPORT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING CONVERSATION HAVING THE LEGISLATURE. IN JUST A STRENGTHENED OUR ABILITY OVERALL TO ENGAGE IN SUPPORT POLICY DSCUSSIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CHANCE TO OBSERVE THOSE FIVE. TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE STEALING. HELLO.
