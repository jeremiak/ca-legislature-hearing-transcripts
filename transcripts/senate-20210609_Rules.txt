I WANT TO THANK EACH OF YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND START BY ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR STAFF AND THEIR ON GOING SUPPORT OF THE CLAIMANTS I HAVE REACHED OUT TO YOUR OFFICES. IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE DURING THE ENDEMIC. I WAS HONORED AND HUMBLED TO HAVE RECEIVED THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENT AND I THANK HIM FOR ENTRUSTING ME TO DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK. WHEN THOSE APPOINTED ALONGSIDE ME UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DIRECTOR SIGNS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO INTRODUCE THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT WITH ME TODAY IF WE WERE IN PERSON MY AMAZING PARTNER AMIR. I AM CREDIBLE CHILD ALEX AND MY WONDERFUL PARENTS JUST A FEW NOT ASSEMBLY PRO WATCHING FROM DOWNSTAIRS AND DOWN THE STREET RESPECTIVELY FOR ALL THEIR LOVE THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT AND THEIR SUPPORT. THEY HAVE MADE MORE SACRIFICES THAN I CAN COUNT AND I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR HAVING GIVEN ME EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN TO GROW AND TO POUR MYSELF INTO THIS WORK. ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN SO MANY CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON EDT. I HAVE DEDICATED MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. FIRST THRILLED OCCASIONAL TRAINING AND FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS THROUGH LEGAL ADVOCACY AND I BRING THIS TO MY ROLE AS GENERAL COUNSEL. WE OFTEN REFERRED TO THE BENEFITS IMMEDIATE MINISTERS AS A SAFETY NET BUT TO SO MANY WHO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THESE BENEFITS ARE REALLY A LIFELINE ENSURING ECONOMIC STABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS AND MOMENTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT DISABILITY OR FAMILIAL CARE OBLIGATIONS. THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE I WOULD RATHER WORK RIGHT NOW THEN I ET DE GIVEN HOW CRITICAL THESE WAGE REPLACEMENT BENEFITS ARE. MY VERY FIRST UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE MATTER DATES BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WHEN I WAS STILL IN LAW SCHOOL. BUT MY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NEEDY AND ERNEST BEGAN ON THE HEELS OF THE GREAT RECESSION WHEN I WAS WORKING AS AN ATTORNEY IN A LEGAL SERVICES NONPROFIT PROVIDING ADVICE AND REPRESENTATION TO HUNDREDS OF CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE BEEN DISQUALIFIED. FROM RECEIVING BENEFITS. I DEVELOP LEGAL EXPERTISE IN THE AREA OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE LONG BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I EXPERIENCED THROUGH MY CLIENTS. THE ONGOING FRUSTRATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. AND THE DESPERATE FEAR OF LOSING THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS BY THEIR ABILITY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. I CARRY THESE EXPERIENCES ALONG WITH THE EXPERIENCES OF THOUSANDS OF LOW WAGE AND IMMIGRANT WORKERS WHO MIGHT HAVE SERVED OVER MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER. TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF MY OWN IMMIGRANT FAMILY I WILL CONTINUE TO BRING THIS LANDS TO MY JOB AS GENERAL COUNSEL AS I WORK TO ACHIEVE-COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. ENSURE DUE PROCESS FOR CLAIMANTS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT AND ABOVE ALL LEVELS ENHANCE THE CLAIM EXPERIENCE INCLUDING IMPROVE ACCESS TO BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO FACE BURGER BARRIERS. THE MISSION OF THE LEGAL OFFICES SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS UNEMPLOYMENT DISABILITY WORK FOR SERVICES AND TAX BRANCHES TO ENSURE THAT LAWS ARE CORRECTLY INTERPRETED CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED. THE OFFICE PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS BY ENSURING THAT CRUCIAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPLICATED WAY A FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS. IT IS OUR ROLE TO HELP TRAIN OUR STAFF ON THESE REQUIREMENTS AND TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO COMMUNICATE THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND NON LEGAL TERMS TO CLAIMANTS. WE ARE WORKING TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL RISKS TRY TO MITIGATE LEGAL LIABILITIES AND AVOID DISPUTES. WE ALSO REPRESENT MEDIAN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND SUPPORT THE ATTORNEYS WHO REPRESENT THE DEPARTMENT INSULIN COURT. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS WHO REPRESENTS THE STATE'S INTEREST IN CRIMINAL MATTERS. THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT NEW CHALLENGES TO THE DEPARTMENT AND EACH CHALLENGE. PRISMS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGAL OFFICE TO ENSURE THE DEPARTMENT IS FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES AND SERVING THE PUBLIC ATTRACTIVELY. PENDING LITIGATION ASIDE WHICH I CANNOT DISCUSS SINCE MY APPOINTMENT SOME OF OUR KEY ACHIEVEMENTS MILLEDGEVILLE OFFICE TODAY. I HAVE BEEN EXPLORING EFFICIENCIES IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS SYSTEM AND FINDING WAYS TO STREAMLINE THE DETERMINATIONS PROCESS WHILE STILL MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER LAW. ESTABLISHING NEW DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS TO HELP DETECT FRAUD AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE AND I MAKE BENEFIT FRAUD. AN IMPROVING NOTICES THE CLAIMANTS. SO THEY COMMUNICATE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED LAWS AND PLAIN LANGUAGE SO THAT CLAIMANTS BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING WHAT IS NEXT AND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM. AND REDUCING BARRIERS TO GETTING BENEFITS BUT THE MAJOR FOCUS ON LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT CLAIMANTS THE COMMUNITY THAT I HAVE SERVED. FOR THE ENTIRETY OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER AND FOR WHOM WITH WHOM I HAVE IDENTIFIED FOR SOME OF MY LIFE. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE WORK AHEAD AND I AM COMMITTED TOGETHER WITH THE LEADERSHIP D. D. TO BRING ABOUT DIGNITY AND SECURITY TO CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY ARE NOT WORKING. IF CONFIRMED I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE BOLD LEADER IS THE DEDICATED STAFF I EDT. ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS PARTNER SISTER AGENCIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE LEGISLATIVE. THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING ALL OF YOU TO ENSURE THAT YOU DO DE DELIVERS ON ITS MISSION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR FOR ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IN YOUR THOUGHTS- CENTER LAYERED YOU WANT TO GO FIRST. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR- R. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MEETING AND WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION IN A OF YOUR ADDRESS SOME OF THE THINGS I MIGHT WANT TO HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT YOU WERE APPOINTED FIVE MONTHS INTO THE PANDEMIC AND HAND SO. SORT OF THE DIE WAS CAST WITH THE D. D. AT THAT POINT BAND. R. S. AND I KNOW LOTS OF US HAVE DIFFERENT EFFORTS DID TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE LONG TERM. BUT YOU ARE GENERAL COUNSEL AND- THEREFORE YOU HAVE- A DISTINCT SLICE OF THIS AND WHEN WE HAD OUR CONVERSATION YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE TEN BRANCHES. AND ALL THE ATTORNEYS WERE GENERAL COUNSEL AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A REORGANIZATION OR RE DEPLOYMENT THAT MIGHT PUT. THE ATTORNEYS IN THE INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES DIRECTLY COULD YOU JUST TALK ABOUT THAT- AND WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU HAVE DETERMINED IN YOUR PARK IF YOU D. D. THAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE REORGANIZED. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYER I REALLY SINCERELY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY- SO RIGHT NOW THE LEGAL OFFICE IS- ITS OWN. UNIT WITHIN THE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE AND ONE THING THAT I HAVE FOUND TO BE SO VALUABLE IS- THE DEDICATION OF ATTORNEYS I HAD BEEN SUPPORTING THE PROGRAMS AND- IT WOULD BE. REALLY BENEFICIAL TO CONTINUE THE INTEGRATION- AND TO HAVE ATTORNEYS REALLY BE YOU KNOW. IT CAN IN THE PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THEM TO HELP- ADDRESSING THE ISSUES TO BETTER IDENTIFY ISSUES BEFORE THEY BECOME PROBLEMS AND TO CONTINUE THE PARTNERSHIP- YOU KNOW AND TO STAY INTEGRATED IN THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN OF THERE HAS THERE WAS A STRIKE TEAM THAT WAS PUT INTO E. D. D. VAN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THEM WHEN YOU WALKED IN THE DOOR. OUR GOAL IS TO LEGAL UNIT IN THE MIDDLE OF A DRESSING SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT MIGHT HAVE COME UP IN THAT PROCESS. YES WE ACTUALLY ALL POURED OVER THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS TOGETHER WE SPENT SEVERAL I'LL STAFF MEETINGS DISCUSSING THEM BRIEFING EACH OTHER ON THEM- FINDING WAYS THAT THEY'LL THE LEGAL OFFICE. THAT COULD HELP IMPLEMENT MANY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU KNOW OUR ROLE IS TO IS TO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT AND IN EACH OF THE BRANCHES AND- WE HAVE WE HAVE STRIVED AND SUCCEEDED IN IN DOING THAT A FEW OF THE STRIKE TO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE DIRECTLY TOUCHED- INCLUDE. YOU KNOW REVIEWING THE REGULATIONS AROUND THE USE OF AN IDENTITY VERIFICATION- PROCESS ID ME SPECIFICALLY. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE GUIDANCE AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH CLAIMANTS- SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW WE MAY GRANT- REVISIONS TO THE INFAMOUS NOTICE OF AWARD- REFERENCED IN THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT. WE'VE ALSO WORKED REALLY HARD TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO ACCESS AS I MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY WITH THAT WITH AN EMPHASIS ARAMBULA THE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT CLAIMANTS. WHO WHO FACE HURDLES IN CONTACTING AND COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY. WITH THE NEEDY. DO YOU THINK SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS- ARE NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED WOULD REALLY CHANGE WHAT THE REACTION IS OF THE DEPARTMENT IF YOU WERE TO PLUNGE INTO. THE SIMILAR SITUATION AGAIN. ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE STRIKE RECOMMEND WERE- YOU KNOW WELL WELL RECEIVED BY EDT AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN THE PROCESS WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED- FULLY MORE THAN HALF- THE REST ARE ALL UNDER WAY AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK TO LOOK AND SEE. HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO MEET THE INTENT AND THE SPIRIT OF THE RECOMMENDATION- YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CHANGING A POLICY YOU KNOW THAT IT IT ACTUALLY PERMEATES DOWN AND LEADS TO MEANINGFUL CHANGE- YOU KNOW ONE EXAMPLE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PIECE. YOU KNOW THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO CHANGE THE POLICY ABOUT WHEN TO USE INTERPRETIVE SERVICES AND THE POLICY WAS CHANGED AND WE DIDN'T SEE THE OBJECT THAT WE ANTICIPATED AND SO WE REALIZED WE NEEDED TO DO MORE- AND SO WE INCREASED OUR OUR CONTRACT WITH OUR THIRD PARTY VENDOR WHO'S WHO PROVIDED INTERPRETER SERVICES. AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR EEO OFFICER WE- BEGAN A TRAINING MODULE SO THAT ALL- ALL THOSE WHO ARE CLAIMING FACING WITHIN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE RENTS ARE TRAINED IN HOW TO USE INTERPRETER. IT'S A SKILL IT'S A SKILL THAT ONE LEARNS- AND SO WE REALIZED THAT WE NEEDED TO DO MORE WE HAD ALREADY MET THE RECOMMENDATION BUT WE WANTED TO GO. ABOVE AND BEYOND AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WANT YOU KNOW WE REALLY MET THE ENTANGLE OF THAT RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU- APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT TO. THE DIRECTOR BOUGHT FONG. A LOT OF US HAVE. LEGISLATION OR WILL BE VOTING ON LEGISLATION I MEAN IT ON DOING A BILL THAT REQUIRES. A RECESSION PLANNED SO WE NEVER GOING TO RECESSION AGAIN WITHOUT E. D. D. R. HAVING A PLAN IN PLACE AND AS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IF YOU SEE WAYS THAT YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE ENGAGING THAT WE DON'T SEE THAT YOU WOULD CONTINUE ALONG WITH THE DIRECTOR TO BE IN CONTACT WITH US BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH. OF THE SITUATION AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS I REALLY APPRECIATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM VICE CHAIR. I BELIEVE THAT MY GOOD COLLEAGUE TO MY RIGHT. SENATOR LAYERED ACTUALLY COVERED THE ISSUES THAT TAUGHT SOME OF THOSE ARE MORE IN DEPTH THAN WE DID WHEN WE HAD THAT MEETING THIS MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING THAT TIME ON WHICH TO FIT TO ME AND I'LL LONG ABOUT EARLY MORNING ARE TODAY AND WE COVERED MANY OF THE ISSUES BUT- ONE THAT STILL STANDS OUT- THAT I WANTED. I GUESS DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO WAS THE DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE WITH THAT CDC ARE AND I KNOW THAT WAS KIND OF YOUR ON YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE A SET DATE WITH YOUR RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGAL ISSUE TO GET ENAMEL YOU IT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE LONGER THAN ONE WOULD HAVE HOPED FOR BECAUSE IT STARTED IN SEPTEMBER AND I THINK THAT. IT WAS FINALIZED SOMETIME IN DECEMBER WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT ODD SO THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF CDC ARE MAYBE PRIVACY ISSUES AND ALL OF THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAINLY THAT TERM UNFORTUNATELY I STILL HAVE HAD MANY CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE CONTACTING ME REGARDING THEIR EDT ACCOUNT FROZEN BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD- THAT THEY WERE IN PRISON AND DO YOU TO- I STAFF WORKING DILIGENTLY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH OF SOME OF THOSE TO CLEAR UP MANY OF THE ACCOUNTS HOWEVER- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS CDD HAS PUT IN PLACE TO ASSIST. WE DEVELOPMENT CLAIMANTS ARE RESOLVED THEIR CASES WHEN THEY ARE FLAG THIS POTENTIAL FRAUD AND I KNOW THAT SPAN AGAIN SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THAT PROCESS SO THAT OUR DISTRICT STAFF'S MIND IN PARTICULAR AND I KNOW THAT I SHARED THIS WITH ALL OUR COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THEY'RE BASICALLY ALMOST PRO BONO WORKERS FOR. EDT CLAIMS AND A U. I. B. CLAIMS EXCUSE ME AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE'S A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT A CLAIMANT CAN GO DIRECTLY THROUGH EDT AND GET THAT RESOLVED RATHER THAN- OF HAVING TO BE THE INTERMEDIARY FOR THEM BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE THERE OBVIOUSLY- FOR MANY WHO HAVE JUST APPLIED. AND ARE. BASED ON SOME OF THE- STAFF REPORTS AND GET. IT FILLED BETTER BUT WE SEE HAVE ONES THAT GO WAY BACK AND I THINK THOSE ARE ONES THAT ARE STILL. PROBABLY WOUND UP IN SOME OF THE FRAUD ISSUE SO- COULD YOU GIVE A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ON THE PROCESS THAT EDT IS USING TO. ASSIST THE CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE HAD. THEIR KEY FLAGGED AS A POTENTIAL FRAUD AND- PERHAPS- TIED UP WITH THE- THE- THOSE WHO WERE IN PRISON IN HAND ON THESE. THEIR VIEWS THEIR IDENTITY TO OBVIOUSLY- ILLEGALLY GOT TO MAKE A CLAIM AND ACTUALLY RECEIVE BENEFITS. ABSOLUTELY AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING- SO JUST BRIEFLY ON THE CDCR DATA SHARING AGREEMENT YES IT WAS ENTERED INTO INTO IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR- AND IT HAS ALLOWED EDT TO- TO CLEARLY SEE DATA AND ANALYZE IT AGAINST OUR CLAIM AT POPULATION. AND WE DO THIS VERY REGULARLY- WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT THE DATA IS NOT AS CLEAN- AS AS WE WOULD HAVE HOPED- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CHECKED AGAINST MANY. MORE WAYS OF IDENTIFYING A CLAIM IT BECAUSE AT THE DATA CAN BE IN PERFECT SHOULD ALSO SUPPLEMENTED THAT DATA WITH A REGULAR CHECKS AGAINST. A THIRD PARTY VENDOR AT THOMSON REUTERS. ALLOWS US TO ALSO LOOK AT- DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND ACROSS OTHER STATES AS WELL AS SOME COUNTY JAILS IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT THE PROCESS HAS BEEN- CLOSELY REVIEWED IT TO ENSURE DUE PROCESS TO ALL CLAIMANTS- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT. WE GET AND TRY TO MAKE A REASONABLE CONTACT WITH THE CLAIM IT BEFORE THEY ARE DISQUALIFIED FROM RECEIVING BENEFITS AND AROUND THE ISSUE OF INCARCERATIONS IT'S SUCH A TRICKY ONE BECAUSE BEING INCARCERATED- WHILE RECEIVING BENEFITS IS THAT- AWAY MEANS TO DISQUALIFY HAVING BEEN INCARCERATED IN THE PAST ISN'T. AND WHAT WE'RE ALSO LEARNING- IS THAT THE DATES OF INCARCERATION ARE ALWAYS WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE. AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO CONTACT CLEMENS AND CLARIFIED THAT INFORMATION- BUT BEFORE- IT LEADS TO DISQUALIFICATION OF COURSE THAT WORKS ABOUT THE CLAIM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO APPEAL AND GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AS WELL. WITHOUT DOUBT GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL IF THE THAT GET SOME REFINED IS SO THAT A CLAIM IS GOING DIRECTLY TO EDT AND- THEN THAT FLAG SOLVE THE SITUATION AND IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE RESOLVED I WOULD THINK. PRETTY QUICKLY WHEREAS RIGHT NOW IT'S STILL. TAKING AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT I DO APPRECIATE TOM THE WORK THAT YOU ARE TAKING ON A BIG JOB AND IT DID VERY DIFFICULT ONE WHEN YOU HAVE A SYSTEM THAT SEEMS TO BE SO UPSIDE DOWN. IN ARE BEING INUNDATED AND IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH WHAT THE CLAIMS AND PROBABLY AN ANTIQUATED- TECHNOLOGY AND I THINK WE SHARED OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT ALL YOU KNOW MORNING CALL SO. WITHOUT ALL ON BEHALF. OF THE MICROPHONE ON. TO MIKE. WHO CONTINUE TO. BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE ASKING QUESTIONS AND- FOR OUR VERY- GOOD CONVERSATION IN DEPTH CONVERSATION AS WELL THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRETEND MISS BEING IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN THANK YOU SENATOR YEAH TO SPEAK WITH ME YESTERDAY I ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION- I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOU TOOK WITH ME AND- I WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SHOCKED THAT YOU'D ONLY BEEN IN THE ROLE SINCE SEPTEMBER. DID MAKE THE COMMENT THAT. YOU TOOK THIS JOB IN SEPTEMBER. KNOWING AT LEAST HAVING SOME IDEA OF KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO WITH THE HOT BETTER HOT MESS THAT WE FIND EDT. AND I WAS. VERY INTRIGUED AND IN PHYSICALLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT YOUR RESPONSE- BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE THE MOUNTAINS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE TO MAKE THIS DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH A DIRECTOR SIGNS BOTH OF YOU. I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD APPOINTMENT AS WELL. TO WORK WITH DIRECTOR SIGNS TO- FIX THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE AT T. AND LIKE I SAID I APPRECIATED AND WAS ENTHUSIASTIC OF YOUR RESPONSES YOU IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED THAT. YOU LOVE A GOOD CHALLENGE AND EVERY CHALLENGE CREATES OPPORTUNITY. AND SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I AM. IN THE REAL WORLD I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY I'M I'M AN EMPLOYER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO EDT IS A WHEEL HOUSE- IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WORK WITHIN IN THE EMPLOYMENT AND- IN HIM IN PRIVATE BUSINESS. AND THAT HR FIVE DEFENDER FOODIE CITY JUST GOES ON AND ON BUT THIS ACTUALLY IS SOMETHING THAT THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART BECAUSE I WAS A BUSINESS OWNER THAT SURVIVED THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE Y. FRENCH- YOU I TRUST FUND DEBT THAT HIT EMPLOYERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE OF THAT GREAT RECESSION. EVAC THEN I BELIEVE IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IT TOOK SEVEN YEARS TO PAY IT OFF VISITED ADDITIONAL EXPENSE AND ADDITIONAL TAX TO ALL BUSINESSES IN THESTATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW IN SOME WAY EMPLOYERS IN THAT SPECIFIC SITUATION HAD- SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT THEY EITHER COULDN'T MAINTAIN BUSINESS- BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THE ECONOMY AND- THEY HAD TO LAY OFF INDIVIDUALS BUT IN THIS CASE. THIS SITUATION WE FACE TODAY IS AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THESE EMPLOYERS DID NOT LADIES EMPLOYEES OFF WILLINGLY THEIR JOBS WERE DEEMED NONESSENTIAL THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO WORK IN BENEFITS FOR PROVIDED AND TO THE U. I TRUST FUND PAN AND ALSO. SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS WERE PROVIDED. THERE'S AN S. THAT THERE TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT I'M AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT'S TWENTY FOUR BILLION WITH A B. DOLLARS IN DEBT- FOR THE U. Y. TRES FRIEND. WHAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. CONCERNED THAT UNLESS CALIFORNIANS YOU AYE LOAN IS FORGIVEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE DIVERT SOME OF THE STATE'S BUDGET SURPLUS TO PAY OFF THE Y. DEBT AND EMPLOYERS THAT HAVE STRUGGLED TO SURVIVE UNDER THE PANDEMIC RULES- AND THE EVER CHANGING PANDEMIC RULES. AND THE HORRIFIC YOUR THAT JUST WE JUST CAME OUT OF UNDER TWENTY TWENTY AND WILL BE SADDLED WITH THIS OF YOU KNOW HUGE DEBT SO I GUESS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS WITH THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY BEFORE YOU. THAT AND- YOU HAVE- REGARDING THE U. I TRUST FUND DEBT AND THAT INSTEAD OF PUTTING THAT TAX BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS. SO I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK AND YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THANK YOU I TRUST FUND WENT INSOLVENT PRETTY EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC- AND MUCH LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION WE'RE SEEING- THE BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. BACK CALIFORNIA ISN'T ALONE THERE'S OVER TWENTY OTHER STATES IN THIS PREDICAMENT- ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I'M YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THE LOVE. THE FEDERAL UNDER PENDING OF THE SYSTEM IS ON- IS ON THE BACKS OF THE- YOU KNOW IT AND- I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD HAVE A- A PANDEMIC LIKE THOSE. CERTAINLY BUT THAT IS A- THE LEGAL FRAME OF HOW THE FUN IS FINANCED AND SO I- ENCOURAGE SOME SOME. TO THE FEDERAL ON THE. I THINK YOU'RE A PRE THAT- IT IS A- I THINK DON'T AND- I DON'T KNOW FOR MICHAEL IN THIS LET UNDER. THAT AND- AGAIN EMPLOYERS HAD NO. THEY HAD NO CONTROL OVER THE BENEFITS BEING ISSUED BECAUSE YOU KNOW RIGHTFULLY BENEFITS NEEDED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF SO PEOPLE COULD STILL CONTINUED WITH FOOD ON THE TABLE BUT THEY HAD NO CONTROL- ANOTHER THING THEY HAD NO CONTROL OVER IS THE JOBS BEING DEEMED A SIMS ASCENTIAL ESSENTIAL OR NOT BE INDEED DEEMED ESSENTIAL AND THE OTHER ISSUE THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE ONGOING CONTINUING THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR WEEK EDITION ALL OF. YOU I FUNDS BEING DISBURSED- WINNING PLAYERS ARE BANKING AND DOING HIRING BONUSES AND PAYING EXTRA MONEY AND FOR PEOPLE TO COME BACK TO WORK BUT THOSE BENEFITS ARE STILL BEING PAID OUT AND IT'S THAT IT'S NOT JUST OUR STATE OTHER STATES ARE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK WITH A SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS. AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE IN YOU KNOW MISUNDERSTAND THAT- IT'S ONLY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS- IS IT THREE DOLLARS. IN THE STATE OR IS A SIX ENDER. IT'S CURRENTLY HUNDRED DOLLARS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO I A MISSILE ANYBODY. IF SOMEBODY'S DRY. SIX CENTER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR A WEEK ARE. THIS IS IN A- THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK SO. IF IT'S SIX HUNDRED AND IT'S THREE HUNDRED THAT'S BASICALLY TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR TO STAY AT HOME. WITH SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS- ON THE OTHER PARTS THE FIVE OR SIX CENTER THAT THEY'RE DRYING- WILL GIVE PLAYERS CAN ACTUALLY TURN INTO YOUR DEPARTMENT TO SAY. I OFFERED MISS CAT MISS CALLAMARD DAD A JOB AND SHE DECLINED IT AND THEN. YOU GUYS WOULD INQUIRE WHY SHE DECLINED IT SHE MAY HAVE A VALID REASON WHICH WOULD ALLOW HER TO CONTINUE BENEFITS. BUT IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE A VALID REASON A REASON WAS- IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I'M GETTING THE SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS AND ET DE. THAT SHOULDN'T BE A REASON FOR PEOPLE TO DECLINE EMPLOYMENT THAT'S READILY AVAILABLE FOR THEM. TO HELP OUR ECONOMY IMPROVE. AND WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. THAT'S A- CAR ACTION- REFUSAL. AT TO WORK AS A RE. OF RECEIVING MORE ON. IS NOT CAN- OF THE A GOOD IT. A GOOD REASON- TO NOT GO BACK TO WORK IT AND JUST. TAKE A STEP BACK I JUST WANTED TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE MAXIMUM IN CALIFORNIA- THIS FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THE AVERAGE PERSON RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS ACTUALLY RECEIVING. UNDER THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK CURRENTLY- AND SO WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL. BENEFITS THAT ARE COMING FROM THE FEDERAL STATE. WE'RE LOOKING AT A TOTAL OF YOU KNOW. UNDER HUNDRED- WEEK FOR THE FOR THE COUPLE. THAT'S NO THANK YOU M. SO I DON'T KNOW IF MASTER MISTRESSES FOR DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR FORTY DOLLARS A WEEK SO EMPLOYERS- OF. IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM WE NEED TO PAY MAKES MAKE SURE THAT EVEN LIKE FAST FOOD AND STUFF IS MORE THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR- I SO AGAIN I DO HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS MEMBER TIM I'M SORRY AS- DO YOU ANTICIPATE- IS THERE I MEAN IS. IS IS THERE AN ANTICIPATION THAT THE ADDITIONAL YOU AYE BENEFITS WILL CONTINUE TO GO OUT AGAIN. THE TRUST FUND IS ROUGHLY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR CURRENT BALANCES I'VE HEARD DIFFERENT NUMBERS. THE LAST NUMBER I HEARD WAS TWENTY ONE POINT THREE BILLION. SO IT'S TWENTY ONE POINT THREE BILLION- AGAIN ALL EMPLOYER FUNDED. AT ALL EMPLOYER FUNDED- AND AGAIN THE EMPLOYERS DIDN'T HAVE A LOT TO DO ON THIS NOT WITH THE INCREASE BENEFITS OR THAT. YOU ARE BENEFITS PAID OUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. DO YOU ANTICIPATE AND THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES CONTINUING TO GO AND IF SO FOR HOW LONG. ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE FEDERAL BENEFITS. YES THE ADDITIONAL YEAH- SO RIGHT NOW THEY ARE-% THEY'RE ALLOWED THROUGH SEPTEMBER- AND IT'S ANYONE'S GUESS WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL DO- COME SEPTEMBER I'VE HEARD I'VE HEARD BOTH WAYS SO I CAN'T SAY FOR CERTAIN. I WAS HOPING YOU HAD AN INSIDE TRACK. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY I'VE HEARD ALSO THAT THERE'S A- THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL AND WILL AND I DON'T SEE FOR GIFT BUT- AT THE END. NOT CHARGE THE TAX CREDIT TERM AS UPON OR IS THAT NOT TRUE. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY WAIVING THE INTEREST- THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD OTHERWISE BE PAYING- AND I BELIEVE THE LAST INTEREST PAYMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE. MILLION DOLLARS- SO I DO KNOW OF THAT WAIVER- I CAN'T SAY IF THERE IS ANY PLANS TO REDUCE. THE TAX. I GUESS IN THE FUTURE SO THERE WE'VE THE INTO BUT THE NOT THE PRINCIPLE. THAT'S MY UNDER THAT'S- SO THERE'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF EMPLOYMENT TRUST OR YOU I TRUST FUND BENEFITS IT'S OVER DRAFTED THERE'S AN ESTIMATE OUT THERE- THAT FRAUDULENT CLAIMS BASED ON THE EDT IS NINE POINT 7% WHICH IS ELEVEN POINT ONE. AND BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS HALF OF THIS YOU ARE TRESPASSING OVERDRAFT SO I MEAN JUST YOUR THOUGHTS AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION BUT JUST YOUR THOUGHTS DO YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PAY BACK FRAUDULENT BENEFITS THAT WERE PAID OUT THAT THEY AGAIN HAD NO CONTROL OR RESPONSIBILITY OVER. YES I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A STEP BACK IN AND TALK ABOUT THAT NUMBER- THE ELEVEN POINTONE THAT YOU WOULD LOSE IT TOO. THE MAJORITY OF THAT 95% OF THAT ACTUALLY WAS PAID OUT ON. PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE THIS IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT WAS CREATED- BY THAT CARES ACT IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND ALLOW US FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE INCLUDING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS RECEIVE- THOSE MONIES SO THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE FRAUD THAT CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED AS ALL OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN THEM BACK PROGRAM AND SO THAT WILL ACTUALLY NOT HAVE ANY DIRECT IMPACT ON THE U. I TRUST FUND ITSELF- IT'S JUST THE REMAINING 5% SO MUCH SMALLER PIE- THAT WAS. THAT WAS PAID OUT. 5% OF THE U. I TRY FUND OKAY 5% THE THIRTY BILLION. A 5% OF THE L. BEFORE PERCENT ELEVEN BILLION OKAY THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME UNDERSTAND THAT I APPRECIATE THAT. I AM. DO YOU I MEAN I KNOW WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO BEFORE THIS IS ALL CALCULATED OUT BUT BASED ON LIKE A DO YOU GUYS DO LIKE I DON'T KNOW M. LIKE FORECASTING OR YOU KNOW LIKE WE DO FORECASTING AND IN PRIVATE BUSINESS ABOUT YOU KNOW IF WE MAINTAIN THESE BILLABLE HOURS YOU MAINTAIN THESE CLIENTS ESTIMATED REVENUE IN THE THIRD QUARTER WILL BE THIS SO WE NEED TO PREPARE FOR TAXES FOR THAT SO IN THE SAME THING DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDT- DO FORECASTING ON WHAT THEY THINK THAT END RESULT OF THIS YOU I TRUST FUND DEBT WILL BE. AND AT. AT THE END OF THIS PANDEMIC SEASON OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE I GUESS NOW. YEAH THAT'S A TERRIFIC QUESTION I UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T- KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT I CAN REACH OUT TO OUR COLLEAGUES. IN THE FINANCE UNIT TO FIND OUT FOR YOU IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. OKAY NO I APPRECIATE THAT. WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU GUYS ARE PUTTING IN PLACE TO PREVENT FRAUD. AND I REALIZE IT IS EIGHT EIGHT ON. THE BALANCING ACT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT DON'T DESERVE BENEFITS THAT ARE FRAUDULENTLY APPLYING FOR BENEFITS ARE DENIED BENEFITS LIKE TE- GUY THAT STARTED IN ORGANIZATION INVITE FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS AND- ACTUALLY DO DOWN TWO POINT EIGHT. MILLION FIVE MILLION A BENEFIT STREET pBEFORE IT WAS ACTUALLY. VESTED IT WAS ISN'T INDIVIDUAL IS AN- AND- SO WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE THAT. BENEFITS AND- GET WE WANNA MAKE SURE THEY GET THEIR BENEFITS THERE'S NONE OF US WHO THINK ANY DIFFERENT THAN THAT. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE THAT DON'T DESERVE BENEFITS DON'T GET THE BENEFITS- THAT. THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN APPLYING FOR THAT SHOULDN'T ARE NOT ENTITLED TO BENEFITS I GUESS YOU'D SAY. YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING TO ME YESTERDAY- CALLED ID ME AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY TOUCHED ON IT BUT CAN YOU GO THROUGH THE IDEA ME PROCESS FOR ME AND LET ME KNOW ANYTHING YOUR PERCENTAGES TODAY BUT I DON'T QUITE REMEMBER. WHAT IT WAS ABOUT THE FRAUD THAT THAT HAS ACTUALLY PREVENTED SO I APPLAUD YOU GUYS FOR PUTTING THAT TOGETHER SO CAN YOU GO THROUGH WHAT I DID MEANS. ABSOLUTELY I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO. ASK FOR THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS TO AB DE UM AND EDB. CONTRACTOR BUT I DO NEED A STARTER KNOCKED. OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEY ARE AN IDENTITY PROOFING- SERVICE AND SO THEY ARE ABLE TO AUTHENTICATE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S APPLYING. FOR BENEFITS IS IN FACT WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE- AND- ACCORDING TO. THEIR INFORMATION THEY ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. THAT YEAH. FOX FRAUD AND THAT NUMBER IS QUITE HIGH- IT APPEARS THAT THEY'VE PREVENTED- THERE ESTIMATES OVER 30% OF FRAUDULENT CLAIMS THAT WOULD HAVE. BEEN FILED IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. M. THE THAT'S GOOD THAT THAT'S A WAY THAT- THAT ANY ID ME BECAUSE- REQUIRE LIKE AN ID LIKE YOU JUST MAKE SURE THE PERSON APPLYING IS THE PER WHO'S ACTUALLY APPLYING- NOW THERE ARE THERE ARE DEFINITELY. ID REQUIREMENTS- SO THEY AND IT DEPENDS ON HOW THERE'S TWO WAYS THE PROCESS COULD GO- BUT THERE IS A PROCESS BY WHICH- THE ACTUAL IDEAS IS PROVIDED- AND IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THE ID CAN BE PROVIDED IF THERE IS A VIDEO ONE ON ONE. WITH ONE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES CALL THE TRUST THE TRUST. TAG VISUALLY AND YOU AND THE IDEA THE SAME. TIME OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT VERY- YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THE WAY FROM IN THE FROM HEAD. DO YOU REQUIREMENTS I IT'S ON THE AND IT TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME TO RECOVER A BENEFITS THAT WERE ACTUALLY PAID OUT- AND IS THERE GOING TO BE IS OUR PLAN TO HAVE STAFF DEDICATED TO PURSUE THOSE WHO COMMITTED PRADA THERE THAN OUR LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE DOING IT NOW WITH THE PRISON SYSTEM. BUT IS THERE A PLAN TO ALLOW STAFFERS TO PUT STAFF ON A ON A YOU KNOW RECOVERY. OF FRAUD BENEFIT PAYMENTS. AFTER SO IT'S JUST AS TO WHAT THE PROCESS THERE IS A- ON BEHALF OF. DEPARTMENT TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE DEFERRED WORKLOAD FROM TWENTY TWENTY- THAT WAS ONE OF THAT THE C. ESTATE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL- AND THAT PLAN IS IN PLACE CURRENT. IS BEING DEVELOPED CURRENTLY AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THE TERMINATIONS WILL BE MADE IN CASES OF OVERPAYMENTS- THOSE WILL BE ESTABLISHED. WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS FRAUD AND SALT- AND IF THERE WASN'T SPEND A WAIVER IS. IS POSSIBLE BUT IN CASES OF FRAUD- THE COLLECTIONS PROCESS WILL START. WELL THANK YOU MUCH. M. WE- A FEW CALL COMMENTS WITH MIKE FROM WHERE COUNTY AND VICE CHAIR. ABOUT CRY REFERENCE SEEN IN- WITH C. IN IMAGE THAT THERE WERE A- ASSEMBLY THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION TO I IT WAS IN A- THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND OTHER SIDE I'LL ASK ME TO TAKE AND I WERE WITH HIM TO HIM. BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT BUT HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT DOES THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ARE NOT ALWAYS- ACCURATE CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE DETAIL ON THAT. YES SO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED- THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CROSS MATCHING IS THAT WE NEED TO. TO MATCH MUCH MORE THAN JUST ONE- AND THEN A FIRE- WE NEED TO CROSSMATCH ACROSS MULTIPLE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T. A VERIFICATION OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED- BY. BY THE- CORRECTIONAL DEPARTMENT AND SO. WE CAN'T COMPLETELY RELY ON IT IF WE ONLY USE ONE DATA SOURCE. THAT'S PRETTY SCARY. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE'S THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE ERRORS AND WE WANT TO AVOID ABSOLUTELY AND SO WE'RE PUTTING IN GUARDRAILS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE- WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION BEING VERIFIED WE COULD ACCIDENTALLY- DISQUALIFY SOMEONE WHO IS A 100% ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS AND WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ABSOLUTELY I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU SO ON A PERSONAL NOTE IN THIS MAY BE TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION. I HAVE I MEAN IF IT IS YOU CAN TONIGHT ANSWER THE SENATE PRO TEM CAN CORRECT ME- THE I HAVE A- SB THIRTY NINE IT'S GOING TO THE BUILDING WHICH ACTUALLY CROSSED REQUIRES A CROSS MATCHING TO TAKE PLACE WHAT ARE AND IF THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE TO THE POINT THAT WE THINK IT SHOULD BE LIKE MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE AND M. IN IN CUSTODY DON'T GET BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ENTITLED TO BENEFITS BUT THOSE THAT ARE RELEASED FROM CUSTODY OR IN CUSTODY. AS WE THINK ABOUT IT YOU AYE BENEFITS ARE PAID TWELVE MONTHS IN THE REARS RIGHT SO FOR THAT OUR WORK THAT HAS DONE THAN THE YEAR BEFORE- IF YOU GET PUT IN JAIL- UNLESS YOU'RE IT'S ILLEGAL FOR YOU TO DROP BENEFITS WHICH I DON'T THINK IT IS BETTER AND IF YOU GET PUT IN PRISON YOU CAN STILL DRIVE BENEFITS AT YOUR- EARLIEST STAGES IN PRISON BECAUSE YOU HAD WORK- PRIOR TO. CORRECT THANK YOU. CHOOSING THIS ISSUE THIS IS A REAL INTERESTING POINT WITH THE NUMBER. AND LAW- SO. THE BENEFIT COULD GUESTS THAT A CLAIM COULD BE- THAT THE ISSUE WOULD BE CARDS. AS A YOU'RE NOT ABLE AND IF. TO WORK- AND THAT WOULD BE THE DISCO. FACTOR IN SO- BE. IN CARS IN ITSELF IS NOT- BUT AN ISSUE IF IT'S- IN THE- IT'S- THE- OF. BY AT THE TIME OF IN CAR. THAT IS. ILLEGAL IS. PHILIP ME TAKE A JUST A STEP FURTHER BECAUSE THAT IT'S A FOR TIME I'VE HAD THAT THAT RECENT- THAT- SENDING HE- IN PLYMOUTH. SO IF I IF I TAKE IT JUST ONE STEP. AND I SAY- SOME JUST SEE. DOES COMMITS A CRIME GETS CONVICTED GOES TO PER SLUSH JUST SAY FOR YEARS K. THREE YEARS WHATEVER. AND THAT TIME FRAME. THE EMPLOYER STILL PAY SEVEN I MEAN ALREADY PAID SEVEN POINT PERCENT. OF THAT EMPLOYEES UP TO THE FIRST STEP THOUSAND. WHICH WOULD GRAYSON ENTIRE THAT PERSON TO BEND. DO THEY GET TO THOSE BY IT'S IT AFTER. AND THEY GET OUT OF. OR AT OF IT BEING A CAR. SO THAT THEY CAN. YOU KNOW FEEL THEIR FAMILY OR WHATEVER AND TELL WHAT THE- TELL FIND IN THAT JOB THEY'RE STILL ELIGIBLE THOSE BEEN. OVER OR NO. THAT'S IT AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO I'M VERY. HOW ABOUT THAT. THE PER IS IN CARS. FOR NEXT. PERIOD OF TIME- AND THE BASE. AT THE BASE. IT IS. USUALLY EIGHT. MY PRICE. TO THE TO THE RECEIPT OF BENEFITS- AND SO THAT. FOR WHAT QUALIFY- BENEFITS MY LIKELY. THEY HAVEN'T WORKED IN. THE RISK HISTORY. IS THERE ANYTHING IT LIKE CAN YOU TELL WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR. AND THIRD- AND THIRD. I SAID OF ID'S AND JUST NOT TO READ ON C. ARE. M. FOR PERSONALLY LIKE TO HELP MY BILL BE MORE ACCURATE. I THINK I THINK WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO- GUARD AS I REFERRED THEM EARLY- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE ABLE LOOK AT MORE DATA THE JUST A SOCIAL SECURITY. BE IT'S NOT ALL ACCURATE- AND SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE WE ARE- REFERRING TO THE SAME INTO- BUT I CAN. THINK ON IT- AND PROVIDE ANY SUGGEST THAT I WOULD BE HELD BUT I DO THINK THAT THE CROSS HAS. ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL AND WILL CAN TO REFER OUR- TO MAKE IT PERFECT AND WE DID YOU START THAT PROCESS AND I'M BACK IN. THE CROSS STRETCHING'S- AFTER THE SOME- AFTER DECEMBER SO THREE. THIS OKAY SO THAT'S- OKAY AND SO IN YOU WEREN'T YOU NOT BOUND TO STATUTES TO DO IT THE BILL WOULD RE. YOU GO TO CAN TO DO IT. AND WHAT ARE SOME OF GUARDRAIL THAT YOU CHECK NOW. TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY THE ELIGIBLE FOR IT IF. DOESN'T GET TO BUT IF. S. SO. ONE OF MY OF THE FIRST OF WE DO AS WE IN THAT. THEY MULTIPLE DAY POINTS THAT ARE CROSS. OUR ARE A LOT- SO IT'S NOT JUST RELYING ON THE NON BUT OTHER. OTHER THAT CAN BE PROVIDED AS WELL. SO THAT ONE WAY TO THAT WE- BOTH TALKING ABOUT SAME AND- THE OTHER OF. IS AT A INTERVIEW PROCESS- REQUEST. THE WE ENGAGE WITH- THE CLAIM. AND SEE CONFIRM- SO THAT WE CAN BE CALM. THAT THE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO US CAN BE RELIED UPON TO DISQUALIFY A CLAIMANT. THE PRAYER TO GET IN LATER I ENTER PEOPLE JOB FOR THIRTY YEARS- WHAT DATA POINTS. I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN DISCLOSE BUT AT THE DATA BUT I. OKAY I'LL TAKE THAT THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND I THOUGHT WELL OKAY WHAT'S POINTS AND I.

HE AND DIRECTOR SIGNS AG ME HOPE THAT EDT WILL- THE ISSUES THIS DEPARTMENT WILL BE RESOLVED AND- I APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON THIS POSITION- I THINK WHEN THEY DO THAT SWEARING IN IF THEY SWEAR YOU IN YOU KNOW. THAT YOU TAKE THIS JOB WITHOUT ANY MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE OF EVASION. BASED ON WHAT WE ALL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR I'D BE QUESTIONING YOU ON THAT SPECIFIC. PIECE BUT I AND ECSTATICALLY EXCITED THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN ON THIS CHALLENGING YOU SEE IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX. THE STATE'S EDM MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET BENEFITS THEY DESERVE BENEFITS. EMPLOYERS ARE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR BENEFITS THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW PAID OUT- LIKE THE YOU THAT. THE U. A. P. FANS AND THEN- I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU. ANSWERING ALL MY QUESTIONS TODAY THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR- I HAVE A FEELING THAT SOME PEOPLE QUESTION US ON THAT OKAY WELL BUT HIGH STATE I. DO IT INTO DIRECTIONS LIKE THEY UNDERSTAND SOME OF US TAKE THE- THAN OTHERS THERE- INQUISITIVE. I SENATOR COME LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I TO WANT TO- THING YOU FOR TO TIME THIS MORE- TO MEET WITH ME AND ACTUALLY- YES ON A DISTRICT THIS IS THAT I BEEN HAVE WITH EDT- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE- YOUR CANDOR AND YOUR HONESTY AND- YOUR BREVITY- AND I WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES BY GIVING YOU AN ENORMOUS CREDIT. FOR WANTING TO TAKE ON THIS JOB AFTER MANY OF IT THE FONG DYSFUNCTIONS OF EDT WERE REVEALED SO KUDOS. TO YOU- REALLY BECAUSE I'VE THAT ONE OF YOUR- TASKS NOW IS TO HELP- REBUILD THE CRISIS OF TRUST THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IN OUR GOVERNMENT- AND- WITH EDT- YOU KNOW BUT I. I TRUST THAT- THERE WILL BE SOME HOPE WITH YOU BECAUSE I THINK FOLKS JUST WANT. HONEST AND TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATION THAT THEY CAN DIGEST- AND THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN RELY ON. SO WHEN WE TALKED I ASKED YOU A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I WANT TO JUST TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THEM ONE WAS ABOUT- THE CONTRACT WITH BANK OF AMERICA- AND I KNOW SOME OF IT- SOME OF THE ISSUES WERE AS A SORT OF ABOUT FRAUD BUT ALSO ABOUT YOU KNOW. THE FREEZING OF- THESE LOADED CARDS. LOADED WITH BENEFITS- SOME QUESTIONS AROUND SORT OF THIS REVENUE SHARING CLAUSE- WITH THE STATE. AND THEN QUESTIONS AROUND THE INTEREST THAT BANK OF AMERICA WAS EARNING ON THESE CARDS WHILE THEY WERE BEING FROZEN SO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO. BUT JUST WANTED YOUR THOUGHTS ON- ANY LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS- RELATIONSHIP FROM THIS CONTRACT WITH BANK OF AMERICA. AND WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN RIGHT THE SHIP- AS WE WORK WITH FUTURE VENDORS. THANK YOU SENATOR OF FOR YOUR TIME AS WELL AND FOR THAT QUESTION WE HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY- OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WITH BANK OF AMERICA TO INSURE THE ELIGIBLE CLAIMANTS WHOSE CARDS WERE IMPROPERLY FROZEN HAVE BEEN UNFROZEN OUT WE HAVE YOU KNOW THE- VISIBILITY INTO TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. EDT HAS VISIBILITY INTO YOUR YOU KNOW THE U. I CLAIM IT AND THEIR IDENTITY- AND OTHER IN OTHER WAYS OF THAT THE PERSON IS ELIGIBLE BANK OF AMERICA ON THE OTHER HAND HOUSE TRANSACTIONAL HISTORY INFORMATION THAT WE ARE NOT PRIVY TO WE HAVE DIFFERENT LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD. SO THAT WE CAN- RESPECTIVELY MEET EACH OTHER IN OUR OWN. WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH EACH OTHER'S. I WOULD SAY THAT OF- THE SILVERLIGHT. IN IN THE SITUATION WAS THAT YOU DID WAS ABLE TO END UP. HEY CLAIMANTS WHO THEY DEEMED ELIGIBLE- THE EDGE- BECAUSE IS A TECHNO INC. THAT INSURERS. THAT WHEN A CARD IS FOR A EVAN ARE NOT LOADED A- AND SO. FOR CLAIMANTS- YOU KNOW EATING ABLE TO CONTINUE MEETING IT'S LEGALIZED. OF WHEN DO- BECAUSE OF THE. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THROUGH. THOSE THIS- AND WE HAVE MADE GOOD FOR. AND I THINK WE ARE. A MUCH STRONGER- AS A RESULT OF THOSE I'M GOING COMMERCE. TODAY GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I'M SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT UPSET IF A WE ENDED UP GO WITH ANOTHER MAN. TO HELP US IN THE FUTURE- YOU KNOW I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD YOUR THOUGHTS ON- HOW VULNERABLE EDT IS- TO. CLASS I LAW- ON THE ONE HAND POTENTIALLY FROM WORKERS WHO MAY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO THINGS THAT THEY HAD NOT SIGNED UP TO DO WHEN THEY WERE FIRST HIRED- GIVEN THE ENORMITY OF- ISSUES EDT HAS FACED. OF THE PANDEMIC- AND THEN ALSO FROM CLAIMANTS WHO FEEL LIKE- THEY'VE BEEN UNJUSTLY TREATED- EITHER THROUGH THAT YOU KNOW- NOT GETTING THEIR BENEFITS IN TIME THE ISSUES THAT FOLKS HAVE HAD WITH THE THIRD PARTY REVIEW PROCESS GIVEN THEY HAVE TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION MULTIPLE TIMES AND WERE ABLE TO YOU KNOW HAVE THEM VERIFY AND THEN RE VERIFY. THEIR EXISTENCE IN TRUTH IDENTIFICATION- I KNOW YOU MENTIONED WHEN WE TALKED THAT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF- CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS- ALREADY WE'RE EVD- HAS BEEN MENTIONED AND SO OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T GO INTO THE DETAILS BUT- YOU KNOW HOW VULNERABLE ARE WE TO ANY ADDITIONAL ONES- OR TO SOME OF THESE THAT MAY POP UP THAT HAVEN'T- JUST YET BECAUSE I THINK. THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION IS THEN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE SO THAT WE DO NOT- INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE. ALSO REALLY GREAT THE ANSWER SOME THAT I HAVE. VERY HARD AT WORK IN IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL RISKS- TO AVOID FUTURE EXPOSURE AND WE ARE TAKING PROACTIVE MEASURES WHATEVER WE CAN TO- TO TOW IT SO TO RIGHT ANY WRONGS AND- WE ARE- I FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN. A GOOD POSITION- WE HAVE- THE DONE. IF I'D- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE THINK ARE THE RISKS HAVE MADE- STEPS TO IN THE AT. THANK ARE THINGS CONTINUE TO RAMP. SOUNDS I TELL YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SOME CAR LAWSUIT NEAR FAMILY TALK ABOUT THAT. IT'S GOT ITS THE LAWYER IN YOUR OUT- YOU KNOW WORK FOR ME CLASS OF. IS ALSO A REAL BIG THING AND I KNOW THAT IT'S THAT YOU ARE PAY. ABOUT WANTED JUST- HE YOUR WRIST TO- HOW PANDEMIC HASN'T. WORK PERMITS CLASS OF. MAYBE THE CHAO. THAT HAVE- ERUPT AS A RESULT OF YOU KNOW THE CONTINUING AROUND AB FIVE- AND THEN THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW- COME.BY THE PANDEMIC. ABSOLUTELY AND THE UNITED ARAB YOU KNOW IT'S JUST OF MISS CLASSIFICATION ARE ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART I HAVE WORKED ON BEHALF OF MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS I AM FOR MUCH OF MY CAREER- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THE LAWS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE MISS CLASSIFICATION DOES REALLY HURT THE STATE IT HURTS BUT THE CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A VERY ARDUOUS PROCESS TO BE FOUND ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY WERE IN FACT EMPLOYEES- BUT ALSO IT HURTS. THE COMPLYING BUSINESSES THE ONES THAT ARE ARE PAYING INTO THE FUND- AND SO THIS IS CERTAINLY AN AREA OF PRIORITY OF OURS- AND WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME STRIDES IN THIS AREA I THINK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FIVE WILL BE HELPFUL BEFORE I JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY UNDER COMMON LAW TESTS- YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS IT AS THE COURTS HAVE POINTED OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF INCONSISTENT RESULTS AND WITH THE THREE PART TEST I'M GOING FORWARD. WE REALLY HOPE TO HAVE MORE CONSISTENT OUTCOMES IN THESE MATTERS WHICH I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL. TO EVERYBODY. HAVING MORE. AS TO WHAT IS. AND WE IS AN PER UNDER LAW. YEAH YEAH. YOU KNOW I INTRIGUED BY THE SERIES OF COURSE THAT MY- COLLEAGUES BIGGEST WITHOUT A- FULL WHO ARE INCARCERATED THE FRAUD- BECAUSE IT IS TRUE THAT WE WANT SO WHO ARE. HAVE WORKED FOR THEIR BEEN AND DESERVE THEIR BENEFITS TO GET IT- TAKE THEM IT'S ALSO I THINK IMPORTANT I. TO AND I SHARED WITH THE STATE ON AND SOMEONE ELSE EDT AT ANOTHER HEARING I WAS ON THIS- IN THE ASSEMBLY IS THEY'RE ALSO A NUMBER OF A PHONE WHO IN FOR A WHO WERE VICTIMS IDENTITY THEFT- AND SO THEIR INFORMATION WAS ACTUALLY USED. A FRAUDULENTLY TO COLLECT BENEFITS AND I ALSO HAVE TO ASSUME THAT JUST AS A MATTER OF TIMING THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME FOLKS WHO- DID WERE. AND PROBABLY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS. AND WITH. WITH IN THE LEGITIMATE PERIOD OF TIME WERE EITHER ARRESTED OR ENDED UP IN JAIL- OR MAYBE IN PRISON ALTHOUGH. PRISON MIGHT BE HARDER TO. RECONCILE BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE AWHILE FOR YOU TO GET THERE IT'S JUST NOT YOU KNOW HE DO SOMETHING BAD ON TUESDAY AND GO TO PRISON ON WEDNESDAY- SO. I ALSO HOPE THAT THERE'S THOUGHT GIVEN TO THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE ENDED UP IN JAIL OR IN PRISON. MORE LIKELY IN JAIL- THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS AND IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT THOSE CAN BE. TRANSFERRED I GUESS WITH THEIR APPROVAL OR SHARED TO FAMILY MEMBERS- BECAUSE WHEN FOLKS ARE LOCKED UP YOU KNOW. THEIR FAMILY- MEMBERS ARE ALSO SUFFERING- AS A RESULT OF THAT PERSON- YOU KNOW NOT BEING ABLE TO WORK. I'M I JUST YOU KNOW. WANTED TO SHARE. WITH YOU THAT. UNEMPLOYMENT AND YOU KNOW THIS I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS FROM OUR DISCUSSION IS SO IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW I REMEMBER GROWING UP MY MOTHER IS AN ACTRESS AND SO THAT MEANS SHE'S A SEASONAL WORKER. AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WAS PART OF OUR EXISTENCE I KNEW WHEN SHE STOPPED WORKING THAT SHE STOPPED GETTING A PAYCHECK IN THE NEXT PAYCHECK SHE WOULD GET. QUOTE UNQUOTE PAYCHECK WAS GONNA COME FROM UNEMPLOYMENT. AND I KNEW THAT WHEN SHE WAS ON ON EMPLOYMENT. WE HAD TO BE REALLY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE FOOD THAT SHE PURCHASED IN OUR CONSUMPTION. AND THAT MEANT HOW MUCH MORE OFTEN WE WOULD GO TO THRIFT STORES- AND THE THINGS THAT I. DECIDED THAT I WOULD ASK FOR. BECAUSE WE COULDN'T AFFORD. AND WE LIVE WITH UNEMPLOYMENT IN OUR LIVES FOR A VERY LONG TIME. WHILE I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AND IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND IN THE BEGINNING OF HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS PART OF HOW WE SURVIVED. AND I SHARE THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA WILL PROBABLY HAVE A SIMILAR STORY. AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF MY MOM. WAS NOT ABLE TO GET HER CHECK. THAT SHE NEEDED. TO FEED HER ONLY CHILD. AND SO I THINK ABOUT THAT STORY WHEN THE CONSTITUENTS CALL MY ACTIONS. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DIDN'T EIGHT. AND THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF FOLKS. ARE HAVING TO DEAL WITH- BUT I BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT AND I CAN HEAR IT IN THE RESPONSES. THAT YOU SHARED AND SO I TOO AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT YOUR CONTINUED PRESENCE WITH EDIE D. N. WHEN YOU ARE WORKING THROUGH HOW TO RE FRAME AND REDESIGN. THE LEGAL ELEMENTS OF EDG. THAT MAYBE YOU REMEMBER THE STORY FROM THE SENATOR FROM LA.

TO FIVE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS SOME OF MY CAREER HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE BEING ASSIGNED TO DO A VOCATIONAL INSTITUTION. TWICE DURING MY CAREER AS BOTH A SERGEANT IN THE CAPTAIN. WHERE I GAINED VALUABLE SUPERVISORY AND MANAGERIAL EXPERIENCE IN A CORRECTIONAL CENTER. I SERVED AS THE CHIEF DEPUTY WARDEN AT FOLSOM STATE PRISON FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS OR HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH BOTH MALE AND FEMALE INCARCERATED PERSONS IN FINALLY I WAS BLESSED AND HONORED TO WORK WITH A DYNAMIC TEAM THAT DEMONSTRATED EXCELLENT. WITHIN ALL DISCIPLINES OF OUR DEPARTMENT AND SHOWED ME THE SUCCESSES OF COLLABORATION WHEN I WAS APPOINTED AS THE WORKING AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITY. IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY I WAS APPOINTED TO MY CURRENT ASSIGNMENT. WITHIN THE HIGH SECURITY MISSION WE FOCUS ON DAILY OPERATIONS WITHIN PRISONS. SUPPORTING AND EMPOWERING OUR LOCAL LEADERSHIP TEAMS AND ENCOURAGING COLLABORATION AMONGST PRISONS WITHIN THE MISSION IN AN EFFORT TO STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE PROCESSES.

THANK YOU AT MADAM CHAIR MADAM PRO TEM IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SIR AND I THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME OUT OF YOUR SCHEDULE EARLIER THIS WEEK- TO MEET WITH ME- BEFORE TODAY- I KNOW WE- TALKED ABOUT. A LOT OF THINGS AND I DON'T HAVE THAT MANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT- I DO HAVE A FEW AND THEY MOSTLY- DEAL WITH HOW WE ARE TREATING- PEOPLE- IN THE SYSTEM PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. IN THE SYSTEM AND PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN THE SYSTEM- AND LYFT ASK THESE QUESTIONS WHEN WE SPOKE SO I CERTAINLY- AS I SHARED WITH YOU NOT INTERESTED IN GOTCHA QUESTIONS- BUT WANTED YOU TO KNOW WHERE I WAS COMING FROM. I RECOGNIZE- AS YOU STATED THAT YOU WERE NOT. THERE IN THOSE PARTICULAR FACILITIES AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENTS. BUT YOU WERE IN FACT- IN THE SYSTEM. AND NOW WITH THIS POSITION- IT WILL BE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN AGAIN- AND IT DEALS WITH YOU KNOW HIGH SECURITY FACILITIES. WHERE I ASSUME AND I THINK MOST OF US ASSUME THAT THERE ARE AMPLE CHECKS AND BALANCES- AND THEN ADDITIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE PRISONS ARE SAFE. AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THE PRISONS THAT ARE SAFE. SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS IF YOU- AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. SO THE FIRST EXAMPLE DEALS WITH THE SUICIDE OF VALENTINO RODRIGUEZ WHO WAS- AN EMPLOYEE AND WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE AFTER REPEATED- INCIDENTS OF HAZING AND BULLYING AND INTIMIDATION. WHERE HE HAD TAKEN A LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO FOCUS ON HIS MENTAL HEALTH- AND HAD BECOME HEALTHY AGAIN AND THEN WENT BACK INTO THE SYSTEM WHERE THESE THINGS CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AND ULTIMATELY HE TOOK HIS LIFE- WE KNOW THAT THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN ONE OF OUR PRISONS AS FIVE YEARS AFTER THEIR RETIREMENT. BECAUSE OF SUICIDE WE KNOW ABOUT THE UPTICK IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ALCOHOLISM AND- ABUSE. BY FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE PRISON. AND SO WANT TO KNOW YOUR pTHAT WE DO NOT HAVE. MORE MR RODRIGUEZ IS. IN EMPLOYED ARM BY OUR SYSTEM IN OUR PRISONS BECAUSE I SUSPECT HIS FAMILY NEVER THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD GO TO WORK AT A PRISON TO KILL HIMSELF BECAUSE OF THE BULLYING THAT HE WAS HAVING TO INDOOR BY HIS FELLOW EMPLOYEES. TWENTY FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO LEADERSHIP OF OUR ORGANIZATION IN MYSELF INCLUDED TO RECOGNIZE THAT I'M EASE OUR- SERIOUS ISSUES. AND I THINK GAS IS FAR IS TREATING OUR EMPLOYEES ARE. WITH RESPECT. EXPECTATIONS ON OUR PROFESSIONAL WORK ENVIRONMENT IS ALWAYS HALF HAS TO BE IN NOT ONLY A PORTION ON HELD. ON AS WELL IT IS ENCOURAGED. THANK YOU COUNTY ONLY GOES A LONG WAY WITH THAT. THE DEPARTMENT'S NINE D. A LOT WITH THE HELP OF THE LEGISLATURE- IN THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS ON EMPLOYEE WELLNESS AND I THINK WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- I THINK- IS WE SPOKE. EARLIER IN THE WEEK I CAN'T SPECIFICALLY SPEAK ABOUT THE CASE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO AS IT'S CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION. BY MY EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT THIS INCIDENT IS. ARE INVESTIGATED THOROUGHLY YEAH. WHERE WERE THE RISKY. PART OR ANY INFORMATION THAT CAN ASSIST US IN COMING TO THE BEST INCLUSION AND ACCURATE CONCLUSION OF AN INVESTIGATION THE ACT- WE DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE HE- GREW UP TO FIND. THANK YOU WELL I HOPE AFTER THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED THOROUGHLY THAT THERE'S ALSO VERY THOROUGH AND HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT CHANGING THE CULTURE IN THE PRISON. AND THE SECOND QUESTION RELATED TO HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE HAS TO DO WITH THE DEATH OF MISTER LUIS ROMERO- AND WHO WAS- DECAPITATED IN HIS CELL. HE WAS PUT INTO A CELL WITH SOMEONE WHO. WAS- HAD BEEN IN PSYCHIATRIC WARDS ARM WAS HAD A TRAUMATIZED A PRIOR STALEMATE. AND HAD BEEN CATEGORIZED AS BEING PRESIDENT'S AN ALLIANCE. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS LAID UP IN THE SALE DATE WITHOUT A HEAD BECAUSE OF SOME EIGHT. ORDER THEM. SO. I MEAN AND THIS MAN WAS SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED ON PAROLE I THINK IN A YEAR SO. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN I MEAN YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT FOLKS HAVE TO- ARM. BE SENTENCED AND SERVED A TIME FOR A CRIME COMMITTED. BUT WE'RE NOT PUTTING PEOPLE IN PRISON TO BE TORTURED TO DEATH BY FOLKS WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE A CELL MATE WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE A CELL MATE- AND SO THEIR SAFETY. THAT WE HAVE GOT TO BE. ADHERING TO BOTH FOR. EMPLOYEES AND ALSO FOR FOLKS WHO ARE. IN THE PRESENCE SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND- QUITE FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LET SOMEBODY IN A CELL WITH SOMEBODY. WHO HAS THAT KIND OF HISTORY THAT IS KNOWN. UNLESS THERE'S JUST DISREGARD FOR THE LIFE OF THE FOLKS WHO WERE THERE. YES THEY DO SENATOR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I'LL POINT OUT THAT. I AS WE SPOKE EARLIER- REGARDING THE ARE YOU PLEASE THEIR WORK ENVIRONMENT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL AS THE INCARCERATED PERSONS WITHIN OUR FACILITIES. ON THEIR- SAFETY. IS IMPORTANT TO US ARE. IT'S WELL KNOWN PEOPLE NEED TO FEEL SAFE IN ORDER TO REHABILITATE THEMSELVES INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX OUR GOAL OF CREATING A BETTER. YOU CAN BE IN A WIN HERE SHE HAS RELEASED TO OUR COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT ACCOMPLISHES OUR PUBLIC SAFETY I THINK CHANGING CULTURE INSTITUTIONS OUR ISSUES ARE VERY DYNAMIC I KNOW WHEN I STARTED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. R. S. I NG YOU LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND OF MY HISTORY AND MY EXPERIENCE IN THIS DEPARTMENT. A DIFFERENT THE ONE THEY WANT WANTED IS TO GET. IN IN A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING HOW DO YOU KNOW- I BACK LOOKS IT WHEN I WAS WHEN I STARTED THIS DEPARTMENT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WE WERE WAREHOUSE IN ON THE FIRST READING PEOPLE WE WORK REALLY PROGRAM THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T GIVEN ONE OPPORTUNITY FOR REHABILITATION. ARE WE HAVING THE ABILITY SHOULD OR EVEN I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING AND IT DOESN'T GO- UNAPPRECIATED BY OUR DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP IN A VAST MAJORITY. OF OUR EMPLOYEES I THINK. I'M A COUPLE OF THE- THAT WE DO CHIU INSURED THOSE TYPES OF. OUR WE NEED TO GET THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS HAPPEN AGAIN I THINK IT COUNT ABILITY INSTRUCT FROM THE TOP DOWN START WITH UNITED SECURITY MISSION- THROUGH THE WARRANTY STAND MANAGEMENT TEAMS ALL THE WAY DOWN- THROUGHOUT OUR ORGANIZATION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A STEPS AND WE DO HAVE STEPS IN PLACE THE WORDS YOU. ARE MANAGED THE OPERATIONS OF THE PRISON BE A MONTHLY. REPORTS THAT WE REVIEW CONCEPT REPORTS USE OF FORCE REPORTS DIFFERENT. OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY. ISSUES ARE ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE- FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE ALL OUR- MONTHLY BUDGET REPORT AND THAT WE REFORM JEWS OUT FOR ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS TALKS ABOUT RIDERSHIP DEFICIT. IN THINGS LIKE THAT. THE OTHER AND ON THE- LATER ON SHE IMPORTANT STYLE CHANGING IS TO BE THERE- SHOULD BE A VISITOR ARE HONORING BASIS AND VIEWS- SORRY. ARCHING DOUBLE CHECK BE A SITUATION AND LYFT. ARE THE INCARCERATED PERSONS ARE NOBODY ARMENIA WHO I MANAGEMENT TEAM AND WE TALK ABOUT SUCCESSION PLANNING GOALS AND I SIT DOWN WITH ALL OF OUR MANAGERS- I SPEAK IN TALK ABOUT SUCCESSION PLANNING IN THEIR DIRECTION AND CHALLENGE THEM OUR CHIEF CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE THEIR OWN PROCESSES TO INCLUDE AT TO TRY TO GET BETTER. THE OTHER THING IS I WALK ON THE HOUSING MARKET THAT RECREATIONAL FACILITIES. I AM GOING TO. COLLEGE COURSE TAUGHT ABOUT- ARE. YOU PRO THAT WE GOING ON AT THE- R. ONE JUST YOUR I AT OUR CALIFORNIA PRISON HE ASKED. I GO TO THERE ARE I SPEAK WITH THE AND- ADVICE COMMITTEES ON THOSE ON WAS YOUR- AND I ASK I. THE JUDGE. BACK HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED. FOR YEARS EVEN BEFORE I STARTED THIS DEPARTMENT ASKING WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS ARE ON ON THE CULTURE AND I THINK WE ALL CAN DO TO PREVENT THAT WE'RE A LOT BETTER THAN WE WERE WHEN I STARTED THIS DEPARTMENT. WE'RE NOT WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN ORDER TO GET YOU STRIVE AND WORK HARD AND WORK TOGETHER IN COLLABORATION. WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INTERNAL. AND EXTERNAL IN ORDER TO REACH OUR GOALS. THANK YOU YOUR HAVE TO THANK FOR- THAT RESPONSE- AND JUST ALSO SAY THAT. THAT WAS NOT AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION- MY QUESTION IS ABOUT IF SOMEONE MR ROMERO DIDN'T NEED. A CHECK IN ABOUT A COLLEGE COURSE HE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE HE WASN'T IN A CELL AT THE CITE NEST. WHO CUT HIS HEAD OFF. AND PULLED ENTRAILS OUT AND USE IT AS A NECKLACE- AND IT GOES TO SAFETY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I THINK LAST YEAR I VOTED AYE ON SENATOR WIENER'S BILL THE TRANSGENDER RESPECT AGENCY INDIGNITY AFTER ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID DURING THAT HEARING IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THERE ARE SAFE. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MR ROMERO IN THE NEXT MISTER ROMERO IS SAFE. EVEN IF THEY'RE LOCKED UP FOR A CRIME BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT TORTURED. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR TRANSGENDER POPULATION IS SAFE. AND IF WE ARE NOT TAKING THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS FOR FOLKS. THAT MIGHT NOT SHARE OR REVEAL OR MAY SHARE AND REVEAL A SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION OR DECLASSIFICATION AROUND THEIR IDENTITY. THEN HOW DO I HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE. KEEPING OUR TRANSGENDER FOLKS SAFE WHO DO COME AND SAY THIS IS HOW I IDENTIFY AND THESE ARE THE KINDS OF- PROGRAMMING AND ELEMENTS OF SAFETY THAT I NEED IN ORDER TO BE SAFE IN HERE WHILE AYE SIR ABOUT MY TIME. SO LIKE THAT'S THE QUESTION. I KNOW WE NEED GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY BUT- WE ALSO HAVE TO HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE FOR LAKE THE DISREGARD OR THE OR THE GROSS EGREGIOUS MISTAKES THAT HAPPEN THAT ACTUALLY COST PEOPLE'S LIVES. YES I WOULD THANK YOU SENATOR RIGHT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE VIOLATION OF POLICY. I IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO SEE IN OUR IN OUR PRISONS I ALSO- TREATY WITH OUR ARMED CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE IN ALL OF OUR PLEASE REFER NONPARTISAN EXTREMELY. IMPORTANT ONES I ALSO- WOULD SAY THAT EXCESS ABILITY TO SUPERVISORS AND SHE ENSURING OUR SUPERVISORS ARE OUT WALKING AND TALKING TO BE A RESOURCE TO OUR EMPLOYEES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- AS I SAID EARLIER- IT'S EXTREMELY TRAGIC SITUATION IT DOES NOT- IF IT ABSOLUTELY MATTERS TO SHOULD BE- IN WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING SHE HAD. ARM CHIU INSURER- ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN UNION MITIGATE THAT- IF SUPPORTERS ARE OUR DREAMS JUNIOR- WE MAYBE I'D GET ON THE COURSE READING IT. THAT. PRISON SYSTEM WE- ALREADY TO. I IN ACTING ASKING OUR THIRTY CHIU AND THAT OR MEETING I HARD TO BE THE EXPECTED OF ALLEGES. IN A PARTLY B. AND- IMAGE PARTNER IN THAT YOU YOU KNOW WE- THIS LEGISLATURE ABOUT SAFETY ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS HE JUST SPOKE ABOUT ABOUT RESEARCH POLICY ARE YOU SOPRANOS ARE TREATING FOR. EMPLOYEES TO ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW THE IMPACT ON HOW PROGRAMS AFFECTING GROCERY PERSONS ON VETERAN JUNIOR OR IDENTIFIES TRENDS YEARS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WERE ON OUR WAY- ON WHAT I THINK WELL I'M I'M EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH WHERE WE'VE GONE WITH SB ONE THIRTY TWO SO FAR WE'RE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE BUT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO GET WHERE- MORE. FULLY IMPLEMENTED INTO. SHE MILLION FOUR HAPPY WITH. THE AMPLE OF ALLEGED. THANK YOU- I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT WHEN WE TALKED AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE- AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I. SHARED WITH YOU IS THAT IT'S NOT. IT'S AS MUCH ABOUT WHAT WE CALL PEOPLE AS IT IS HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING AND WITH ALL OF OUR SYSTEM. I KNOW THAT YOU MENTION THAT THERE ARE. A LOT OF SMALL SUCCESSES THAT ARE HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM- AND WE SORT OF TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF MAKING THOSE. SUCCESSES AND THOSE PROGRAMS SCALABLE- AND WAYS IN WHICH TO BRING CONSISTENCY WITH THE PROGRAMMING. ACROSS THE MULTIPLE PRISONS- THAT WE OPERATE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I CERTAINLY NEVER WANT TO BE SEEN AS LIKE YOU KNOW. AN APOCALYPTIC MEMBER HALLWAYS TALKING ABOUT BAD STUFF WITH CDC ARE BUT- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ELEVATE THESE KINDS OF THINGS SO THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SOMEONE IS WATCHING. AND THAT SOMEONE CARES ABOUT THESE PEOPLE- AND I YOU KNOW I THINK YOU HAVE A TALL TASK IN FRONT OF YOU- AND AHEAD OF YOU- AND MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST SORT OF. USING THESE POSITIONS AS DJANGO POSITIONS AND HAVING PEOPLE GO FROM ONE SIDE ONE SLOT TO ANOTHER. WITHOUT REALLY INVESTING IN THE KIND OF CULTURE CHANGE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE THAT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CDC ARE SUCCESSFUL SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT WITH ME. AND FOR YOUR TIME ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS AGAIN TODAY. YOU CENTER THANK YOU. SENATOR GROVE. M. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEMP I- I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE AND IN LOS ANGELES A FROM LOS ANGELES ASKED BECAUSE I STILL DON'T- I DON'T FEEL SATISFIED WITH THE RESPONSES AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE OR- MEANING I JUST AM LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC RESPONSE. YOU KNOW AS THE MURDER WHICH PUT THIS CHANNEL THIS INDIVIDUAL IN PRISON FOR THEIR FOR HIS LIFE- ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE IN KERN COUNTY- GIVE IT PENNER WAS THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD SHE WAS A MOTHER OF SIX WAS DOWN OR LACK HE'S LIVING IN A HOTEL AND SHE RUNS INTO THIS INDIVIDUAL I'M NOT GONNA SAY HIS NAME BECAUSE I AM NOT GIVING IN MANY. NO RECOGNITION WHATSOEVER- KIDDING NO SYMPATHY HE SAID HE DIDN'T THAT HE SAID THAT HE- IS A **** AND THAT- HE SADISTIC AND THAT HE WOULD DO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN- IN THIS YOUNG WOMAN THIS YOUNG MOM LOST HER LIFE- THE SISTER THE STARTER- IT ROCKED OUR COMMUNITY. AND- SO I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT WASN'T ANSWERED THAT I WOULD LIKE A SPECIFIC ANSWER TO IS. WHY DID HE HAVE A CELL MATE. DID YOU SENATOR ON FOR THE QUESTION AREN'T IN A BELIEVE SHE'S SPECIFIC INCIDENT I BELIEVE WE'RE CURRENTLY IN LITIGATION. ON ON THIS INCIDENT SO. I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN SPEAK ABOUT HIS SPECIFIC. INCIDENT BY- OKAY GENERALLY GENERALLY WHY WOULD YOU PUT A SELDOM US GIVE A SADISTIC. TIME AND TIME AGAIN KILLER. THE ADMITS THAT HE HAS AN ISSUE THE SADISTIC THAT HE'S A SATANIST AND HE ARE ACTUALLY I DON'T SEE ENJOYS IT BUT HE ACTUALLY. SAYS HE'LL DO IT OVER AND OVER WHY WOULD SOMEONE LIKE THAT HAVE A CELL MATE SENATOR LET ME- I THINK I HAVE A WAY TO FRAME THIS QUESTION THAT I WOULD LIKE A RESPONSE TO IN WRITING THANK YOU I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AND YOU MAY HAVE TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. MISTER LOZANO BUT WE WILL EXPECT IT BEFORE- BEFORE THE FLOOR VOTE WHICH IS. A WRITTEN RESPONSE TO WHAT FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED THAT COULD LEAD TO A VIOLENT MENTALLY ILL OFFENDER BEING DOUBLE CELLED I THINK IF THERE ARE POLICIES ARE OR DIRECTION WITHIN CDC ARE THAT COULD RESPOND TO THAT WE WOULD TRULY LIKE TO SEE IT BECAUSE IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. BUT THERE ARE CLEAR GUIDELINES ON OR OR SOME INFORMATION THAT WE COULD HAVE ACCESS TO AND THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE TAKES UP AT SOME POINT. ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF AND REALLY WITH RESPECT YOUR JOB IS INCREDIBLY HARD. I AND THERE'S NO WAY MOST OF US COULD EVEN REMOTELY UNDERSTAND- THE KIND OF RESPONSIBILITIES BUT I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AND WITH THE PRISON POPULATION DECLINING. IN PARTICULAR I THINK THE IN LIGHT OF THAT- WE WOULD LIKE TO GET A WRITTEN RESPONSE ON THE FACTORS- SO THAT WE CAN DETERMINE- YOU KNOW IF WE THINK IS A LEGISLATURE THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO TO BE HELPFUL TO YOU- SO THAT THAT'S TAKEN OFF OF YOUR PLATE YOU DON'T HAVE TO. MAKE PERSONAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AROUND IT IS THERE MAYBE POLICIES THAT APPLY BUT I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT QUESTION IN WRITING SO THAT IT IS- IT'S CLEAR WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AND I DON'T KNOW SENATOR I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT BUT IF THAT COULD BE HELPFUL I THINK ALL OF US WOULD LIKE THAT OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THREE MORE QUESTIONS. THAT IS THAT ARE THE SAME AND I THINK I THINK WE DO EXPECT RESPONSE BUT IF THAT'S HELPFUL I APPRECIATE THE PRO TEMPS- INTERFERENCE ON THAT IN A MORE PROFESSIONAL WAY TO. RESPOND TO THIS- I'D LIKE MY GIRL YOU KNOW HERE I DID HIGH I AM NOT MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT A PERFECT I JUST. I PUT IT IN I PUT IT IN WRITING IN THAT WAY SO THAT WE GET A RESPONSE THAT WE- HAVE RECEIVED YOUR AND HOW TO USE IT THE WAY YOU ASK THE QUESTION IS THE WAVE MOST PEOPLE GENERALLY PROBABLY NOT NO I THINK ANOTHER WAY TO SAY TO SENATOR GROWTH LEADS TO PRO TEM FOLLOWERS- PLEASE. OKAY NOT EVEN NICE TO FORGIVE US. FOR WE HAVE OUR OWN BRAND OF DIFF. HERE SENATOR GROWTH PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM I WOULD ALSO LIKE IN THAT LETTER IF POSSIBLE. THE LIKE HOW OFTEN TO GUARDS GO BY A SALES LIKE WHAT'S THAT CHECKED TIME WARNER. METER PEOPLE CHECKED EVERY TWO HOURS FOUR HOURS SIX HOURS EIGHT HOURS. SO WE COULD ABSOLUTELY- ADDED TO THE ANSWERS THAT I PROVIDE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IN WRITING. A GENERAL FOR OUR ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION- IN THE CENTER IN OREGON HISTORY OF SEGREGATION UNITS- IS THERE WHICH CHECKED ON TWICE AN HOUR- NO MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE MINUTES APART. TWICE AN HOUR NO MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE MINUTES APART HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DECAPITATE SOMEBODY WITH THE SHIP. I'M SORRY CENTER I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION NINETY I DON'T KNOW. OKAY M. I WOULD THINK IT WOULD TAKE AN EXTREMELY LONG TIME AND- ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE WEAPON WAS ALL- I WOULD THINK THAT BASED ON THE INFORMATION I READ THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WAS- THE INDIVIDUAL MUST REMEMBER WAS ALIVE- FOR AT LEAST PART OF THIS TORTURE THAT TOOK PLACE AND I WOULD THINK THAT IF- IS CDCR STAFF. WALKED BY THE CELL EVERY THIRTY FIVE MINUTES. THERE WOULD BE SOME TYPE OF. I DON'T KNOW BLOOD WHATEVER YEAH. THEY WOULD EVEN THINK. ANYWAY SO OKAY I'LL SKIP THAT SUBJECT MATTER- I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I THAT YOU KNOW THEM. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS TO DEAL WITH A PRISON INMATE POPULATION. I'M ARGUE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES AND I THINK THEY SHOULD ALL BE SAFE. AND IN THE PRISON SYSTEM I REALIZE THERE ARE MANY POLICIES THAT ARE PASSED OUT OF THIS BUILDING THAT DON'T ALLOW YOU TO HAVE SOME TYPE- YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF AUTHORITATIVE CONTROL I HAVE. HEARD STORIES FROM SOME OF THE REPRESENTATIVES WITH A LARGE PRISON POPULATION IN OUR AND MY COMMUNITY AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER NICE FACT MY COLLEAGUES. CAN TAKE DOWN. WE HAVE MORE PRISONS THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY I AM. I F. I DO I DO UNDERSTAND AND DO KNOW THAT THE WORK THAT CDC ARE. OFFICERS DO THE G. YOU GUYS I FEEL SOMETIMES ARE LIKE IN WAY OVER YOUR HEAD YOU'RE NOT ARMED AS THEY THROW FECES I KNEW THEY SPEND ON YOU THEY THROW URINE ON YOU SO YOU'RE EXPOSED TO YOU KNOW AT EITHER SUBJECT TO TRANSMIT A LIVE TRANSMISSION OF DISEASES- YOU KNOW TRANSPORTING INMATES FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER AND YOU KNOW THE LEFT OF OUR COUNTRY OR THE LEFT OF OUR STATE WANTS TO. YOU KNOW TO GET YOU KNOW GIVEN I DON'T KNOW GARDENING TOOLS TO HAVE A GARDEN AND IT'S LIKE THEY'D KILL EACH OTHER MOST A LOT OF MONEY LIKE THIS INDIVIDUAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY I WOULD NEVER GIVE HIM A GARDENING TOOL AND SO. I DO I THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT ALL OF YOU DO I REALLY REALLY DO I KNOW IT'S A VERY VERY HARD JOB I JUST THINK THAT WHEN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS HAPPEN AND IT THAT CASTING A HUGE DOUBT ON THE ABILITY TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND SO- S. THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO LET ME AND GO ON TO A DIFFERENT SUBJECT. CONTRA BRAND I ACTUALLY GOT TO GO TO KERN COUNTY PRISON I WENT TO PELICAN BAY AND I WENT TO A COUPLE OF OTHER PRISONS TO A TOUR THESE PRISONS- WHEN WE WERE STARTING TO ADDRESS THE- THIS THAT THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION- WANTED TO RELEASE PRISONERS AND SO I KIND OF WANTED TO. YOU KNOW CHECK IT OUT MYSELF I GUESS AND THEN- I ALSO WAS VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS THAT ARE SYNCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. OR THE YOUNGER THAN EIGHTEEN AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE AND YOU HAVE THESE YOUNG KIDS WITH NO HOPE THAT. HAVE NEVER EVER NEVER GOING TO SEE THE OUTSIDE OF YOU KNOW FOR SOME STUPID RIFIC THING THAT THEY DID. M. ON THAT SUBJECT MATTER. I'D LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION IF YOU DO HAVE A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD THAT COMMITS M. LISC MURDER LIST NAME A CRIME AND THEIR SENTENCE TO LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE IF THEY COMMITTED THAT SAME PRIME WHEN THEY WERE EIGHTEEN. THEY WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR PAROLE BOARD AFTER SEVEN YEARS- WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOMEBODY AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS SATANIC PERSON AND I DON'T EVER WANT ANYBODY LIKE THAT INCLUDED IN THIS. EQUITATION BUT WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT OF SOMEBODY NEVER EVER EVER BEING ABLE TO GET OUT OF PRISON IF DOES IT CREATE MORE AT THAT. A PROBLEM CHILD IN PRISON YOU KNOW LIKE MORE OF A RISK OR IF THEY HAVE HOPE AND THEY KNOW IT FOR ON GOOD BEHAVIOR FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GO THROUGH PAROLE BOARD. APPROVAL HEARING AND YOU KNOW RE POSITION FOR RESET AND SEIGNER WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE DO YOU THINK THAT THAT CREATES A MORE MODEL PRISONER. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE. SO IN MY EXPERIENCE- I USE- BEEN A LEADERSHIP ROLES AT AT FIVE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AND I ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT OUR WHOLE WITHIN OUR COUNTRY POPULATIONS ARE IT IS IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR THE LOCATION A BETTER- OP PROGRAM THE- OR- I PERSONALLY PERSONALLY BUT ALSO SAFER WORK ENVIRONMENTS OUR STAFF. SO I ALWAYS THINK HAVING LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL HOPE THAT IT WOULD BE THAT THEY CAN WORK THEIR WAY IN ON YOUR WAY- TO SHOW UP FOR WORK THAT DAY TO BE RELEASED BACK INTO OUR SOCIETY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE IN DEPTH PROVIDES A SAFER. OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET FOR A PLEASED TO WORK I PERSONALLY ARE RECOMMENDED- BECAUSE RATED PEOPLE THAT I SHOWS US STEPS OF REHABILITATION FOR ELEVEN MORE SECRETARY FOR CONSIDERATION. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT OUR LOCAL ARMENIAN JEWS USE IN INSTITUTIONS ROCK THE STATE ON A REGULAR BASIS AND ABSOLUTELY I HOPE IT YEAH COMMITTEE HOPE TORRENT PERSONALLY POPULATION PROVIDES SAFER. OUR WORK ENVIRONMENT FOR EMPLOYEES IN A BETTER OPPORTUNITY IN WAR FOCUSED IMPORTANCE ON REHABILITATION FROM ARCONIC. INCARCERATED POPULATION. THE YOU. AND YOUR FOR GOT ELECT ON LIKE YOU A CRIME YOU DO THE- IT'S LIKE I'M ON THE WITH THAT I HAD NO. ADJUSTMENT PERIOD LIKE LIKE I DIDN'T FROM AT ALL. THEN I MET SOMEBODY THAT- HAD ME SPEAK TO- SOME YOUNG KIDS AND THEY REALLY TOUCH MY HEART AND YOU KNOW I THOUGHT REDEMPTION COULD POSSIBLY BE POSSIBLE FOR SOME OF THOSE. INDIVIDUALS AND EVEN ADULTS I THOUGHT YOU KNOW M. F. PERFECT CASE EXAMPLE- I WHEN I WENT TO VISIT ONE OF THE PRISONS. YOU KNOW YOU TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THEY'RE NOT EVERYDAY PEOPLE RIGHT I'M SHAKING PEOPLE'S HANDS HIGH SENATOR GROVE IN. THE HOPE THAT WORDING LIKE GRABS MY ARM LIKE IS GONNA SOLD ME AND HE SAYS DON'T TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE DON'T TOUCH HIM. LIKE OKAY. AND THEN WE WENT INTO A CLASSROOM TYPE SETTING AND THERE WAS AN EMPTY SEAT LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM SO I JUST WALKED IN AND SAT DOWN AT THE EMPTY SEAT MAJORITY SAID IAN AND THE GUY WAS KINDA HIDING A STAFFING. AND I SAID THAT WHAT IS IT HE KEPT HIDING IT TWICE TO GET FROM HIM. AND HE'S I LOOKED AT IT AND THEY WERE WORDS LIKE CAL AND- THEY THEY WAS DEFINITELY ON A COW WAS ON IT. BECAUSE IF I PASS THIS TEST TODAY I GET. TO MOVE ON TO A HIGHER GRADE LEVEL. AND I SAID I CAN YOU'LL DO. REALLY AND HE GOES WELL TRUTHFULLY I HAVE TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY SHOULD BE SPELLED P. AJ. SO I YOU KNOW MY HEART HAS OPENED UP TO A POPULATION THAT AND- THIS IS TWO THOUSAND TEN WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE I DON'T WANT THEM COMPLETELY DISCARDED NOW WE'RE NOT AGAIN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. THE WHACK JOB THAT COMMITTED A HORRIFIC MURDER SEVERAL TIMES AND DECAPITATED CELLMATE- BUT I THINK THERE IS I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HAVING PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE HOPE TO GET OUT EVEN IF THEY'RE SIXTY YEARS OLD HAVE HOPE. FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD WHATEVER TO GET OUT AND HAVE. A HOPE TO IF IT CREATED A SAFER ENVIRONMENT. ONE OF THE THINGS I SAW- AFTER WE LEFT THE GENERAL POPULATION AND- YOU KNOW ALL OF THAT IN THE YARD WE WENT INTO THE FORENSIC CRAM. AND I WAS. SHOP IS THE BEST WAY I CAN PUT IT OF THE COMMUNICATION SKILLS THAT PRISONERS HAVE. NOTE YOU KNOW FULL THAT IS TINY AS A- ARE YOU KNOW JUST IT'S LIKE I CAN YOU BELIEVE IS NOTE AND THEN WHEN THEY TOOK THE LITTLE- TWEEZERS AND THEY AND FULL THAT THAT NOTE IT WAS A YOU KNOW. TWENTY PARAGRAPH. THE AND IT DID LOOK LIKE IT COULD FIT UNDER A FINGERNAIL. THE MATTER FACT THAT'S HOW THEY GOT THERE IS A VENDOR FINGERNAIL. AND ALSO CELL PHONES RADIOS HOW DID THEY GET THOSE THINGS IN PRISON. SHOW NO CHEATING IN GENERAL ARE USUALLY HAND WRITTEN ON BY OUR HI GROCERY GET POPULATION TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER- THE CELL PHONES AND RADIOS- CELLPHONES ARE OBVIOUSLY. A CONTRABAND ITEM IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM- THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED. IN SO THOSE ARMS. ARE RUNNING ILLEGALLY WHETHER IT BE THROUGH- DROPS TO SUPPLY ENGINES THAT. ARE BRINGING SUPPLIES FROM OUTSIDE OF THE SECURE WALLS INTO THE INSIDE- VISITORS EMPLOYEES. MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE'RE ALWAYS. TRYING TO COMBAT DAY INTRODUCTION. OF CONTRABAND. SO WHAT DO YOU DOING TO THE SO THEY IT KEEPS OUR AND OUR OFFICER SAFE. ENTER INMATES BUT OFFICERS. YES ON A DAILY BASIS AT ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS WE HAVE ON OUR UNIT AN INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES UNIT KNACK IS WORKING HARD TO COMBAT THE INTRODUCTION OF CONTRABAND ON WORKING CHOOSE- JUST LIKE FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN- I. IT WAS REALLY POPULAR HE S. T. ARE SO JUST EVERY DAY CONTROLS ARE WE DO CELL SEARCHES DO YOU- CLOVER BODY STURGEONS DO YOU. BURKE CHIU OUR UNCLOTHED BODY SEARCHES D. CONTROLLERS FANS LINES. THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT WAYS WE REVIEW AND ARE LOOKING CHIU AND NAY ALL IN OF COURSE LISTEN TO OUR PHONE CALLS DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT. SO WE YOU COULD GIVE ME THREE THINGS THAT WE AT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO. TO HELP YOU KEEP- INMATES SAFE AND MORE I WAS THE MOST WIDELY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE OFFICERS THAT- WORK IN THESE THESE FACILITY SAFE. I WHAT WOULD THEY BE. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SENATOR THANK YOU- I WOULD SAY ACTION TEAM TO SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY. CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR THE MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT IAN. REHABILITATION AND- I THINK DOES PROVIDE. THE FOR WORKING ACTUALLY TECHNOLOGY SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT WE ARE USING TODAY WE DIDN'T HAVE TEN YEARS AGO TO HELP US WITH CELL PHONES- DOES. HE IS THE EVER EVOLVING ARAMBULA. INCLUSION OF CONTRABAND INTERDICTION ERRORS OUT WE GET UP I. ONE OF OUR HIGH SECURITY PRISONS IAN JOB SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BAGGAGE SCANNER STUFF LIKE THAT ALWAYS ASSIST IN APPREHENDING CONTRIBUTE. OKAY THANK YOU AND I DO I DO APPLAUD YOU GUYS I MEAN THAT I EVEN WENT TO THE ISSUE AND THE THAT'S PRETTY SCARY MORE- I KNOW THAT PEOPLE SAY OH THEY KEEP HIM IN DOG CAGES ARE DOG KENNELS OR THINGS LIKE THAT BUT- AND- THOSE ARE PRETTY SCARY PEOPLE- IN THOSE TEN BY TEN- CAGES I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE CALLED- WE- WE HAVE BY. THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION UNITS HAPPENS WITHIN SMALL MANAGED ARTS SMALL MANAGE ME ARTS OKAY YES AND YES SO AND WHEN WE WALKED BY THERE IT ALWAYS SAID I WAS REALLY THANKFUL THERE WAS SAID CHAINLINK AND A BRICK WALL BETWEEN US ARE YOU KNOW THAT WAS HLFWAY UP SO I WAS THANKFUL FOR THAT SO- ANYWAYS THANK YOU- AGAIN JUST LIKE THE PREVIOUS- ET DE MIS. LEVINE HI I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE TAKING THIS JOB- BUT I'M GLAD THAT YOU ARE AND I HOPE YOU WORK DILIGENTLY TO KEEP OUR OFFICERS SAFE. AND SEND THEM HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES EVERY NIGHT AND I HOPE THAT- ALIGNED WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES COMMENTS THAT. YOU KNOW AND IF YOU'RE CONVICTED OF A CRIME IN YOUR SERVING IN A IN A PRISON SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. YOU SHOULD AND SERVE YOUR TIME. YOU SHOULD TRY YOUR THING HERE TO GET REHABILITATED TO BE A BETTER SOME MEMBER SOCIETY WHEN YOU GET OUT- BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE- SOME TYPE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM THAT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DECAPITATED OR MURDERED OR STABBED HER FEET AT FOR. WHATEVER TAKES PLACE. WHATEVER ELSE TAKES PLACE IN PRISON SYSTEM. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR ROVE MEADOW VICE CHAIR. FOR THANK YOU THE MEMBERS HERE AND- SKEWS ME MR LEVINE- I SAY GOD BLESS YOU I'M LOOKING AT YOUR RESUME AND YOU BEEN DOING THIS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND- EVEN GRADUATED UP WHICH IS REALLY INCREDIBLE TO. THE HIGH SECURITY PRISONS WHERE YOU HAVE PROBABLY OF THOSE WHO ARE. ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN THEIR TAN IN TERMS OF THEIR DANGER- TO THEMSELVES AND CERTAINLY TO OTHERS SO- WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND CERTAINLY I YOU WOULDN'T BE DOING IT WITHOUT IT COME. OF SUPER COMMITMENT. TO WHAT IS NOW AN APPROACH OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WHICH I AM VERY HIGH ON. AS A MEMBER OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT OUR DEALS WE HAVE THE MORE SERIOUS IT'S PROBABLY TO WHAT. YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH JAMES MUSIC FACILITY IN IRVINE IT'S CALLED THE FARMS. THAT THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAM STARTED IN PILOT STARTED I DO SEE HOW THOSE ARE WORKING. AND YOU'VE BEEN AND LOOKING OUT TO THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT YOU HAVE SERVED. YOU PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD PERSPECTIVE ON WHETHER THIS APPROACH TO REHABILITATE. IS DOING THE JOB- AS WE SEE SO MANY BEING RELEASED- FOR. GOOD CREDIT GOOD CONDUCT HI AND I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT I IF I'D HAD TIME TO HAVE YOU IN MY OFFICE WE WOULD HAVE A MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD THAT DIFFER OF THE EVOLUTION REALLY. OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHILE IT STILL HAS ITS ISSUES AND IT'S PROBLEMS. THE DARK SIDE I WOULD SAY. IT SEEMS TO ME THERE'S A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES. RE UNFORTUNATELY- FROM DATING BACK TO THEIR VERY EARLY YEARS ARE YOU HAVE TO DO IS VISIT THE FOSTER HOMES WHERE WE HAVE THE BABIES WHICH I'VE DONE. MANY TIMES AND WONDER HOW THAT LITTLE BABY ALL BECAME SUCH A DANGER- AND NOW IT'S YOU KNOW. VERY HIGH SECURITY PRISON ANSWER ONLY A DANGER TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS AND HAVE YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE A SATANIC. DRIVES SO YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL. AND I THINK. YOU ARE A GREAT- CENTRIST. ON WHETHER. THIS APPROACH FOR REHABILITATION. GIVE WERE. WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER. WHAT AND WHAT. ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN WHERE YOU THINK WE ARE BECAUSE IT'S NEWER CERTAINLY NEWER ALL RIGHT TO- THE PROFESSION CLEARLY AND WHAT OF WHAT YOU ENVISIONED FOR THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL ON RECIDIVISM IF THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING AND I I'M NOT GONNA ASK THE CITY QUESTIONS I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE. YOUR HISTORY WITH THAT YOU WOULDN'T STILL BE THERE I DON'T BELIEVE UNLESS SHE BELIEVED IN WHAT IS STARTING TO HAPPEN IN THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IS THERE IN OTHER WORDS THE BIG H. WORD HOPE THERE IS HOPE THAT YOU CAN TAKE AND MODIFY BEHAVIOR. ARE EVEN THOUGH PERSONS OLDER AND PUT THEM BACK INTO SOCIETY AS A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER AND SOMEBODY TO ENJOY THE OPPORTUNITIES OF FREEDOM THAT IS SO FUNDAMENTAL TO LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS WHICH UPON WHICH THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED SO IF YOU COULD SHARE THAT WITH ME- THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND I BELIEVE THIS MEETING WITH A MORE POSITIVE VIEW. IN WE START WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE DARKER SIDE OF CORRECTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK ABSOLUTELY- HOPE THE REHABILITATION. ARE IS WORKING- AS I SAID EARLIER- IN MY OPENING STATEMENT I STARTED- IN AT THAT TIME WERE ORGANIZATION APARTMENT WERE. YOU AWARE HOW CD COURSE RATED PEOPLE AB WAS AT A VERY VIOLENT- TIME IN IN OUR HISTORY- I THINK WERE BETTER AT WHAT WE DO TODAY I THINK OUR ORGANIZATION UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF REHABILITATION THAT UNDERSTANDING. THE WHOLE HI IT'S- WHERE HE- IT'S SO EXCITING TO GO INTO SOME OF OUR HIGH SECURITY PRISONS SOME OF THEM WERE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS HEARING. IN C. R. EMPLOYEES WITH SMILES ON THEIR FACE AND CULTURALLY PEOPLE BACK YOU KNEW EARLIER IN YOUR CAREER- MAYBE NOT ME PERSONALLY BUT I'M WALKING WITH SOMEBODY WHO KNEW THAT ICARCERATED PERSON TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. HE AND- THEY NEVER THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN SPEAK WITH OUR OUR POPULATION THE WOULD HAVE NEVER ENVISIONED THEMSELVES THERE AND UNDERSTANDING YOU FOR. OUR OF REHABILITATION AND SO WE TALK A LOT ABOUT GIVING BACK IN THAT BE TAKEN SO MUCH FROM SOCIETY THAT WERE GIVEN HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE BACK AND THAT'S THAT GOES A LONG WAY FOR- OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME IS AN EMPLOYEE WELLNESS. ARMS SAFE SECURE FACILITIES ARE THOSE ALL IMPORTANT THINGS BUT IT ALSO GOES A LONG WAY YOU ARE COMMUNITIES INDIVIDUAL IS RELEASED BACK IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IT IMPACTS. SO MANY PEOPLE NOT JUST GRAPPLING COURSE LEADER PERSON THEY HAVE WIVES THEY HAVE HUSBANDS THEY HAVE DAUGHTERS. COUSINS FAMILIES. FRIENDS THAT THEN WE POSITIVE IN ARE COMMUNITY. ARE B. O. B. OF THAT HAVE NON WORK. IN THE COMMUNITIES OF OUR OF OUR PRISON SYSTEMS ACTION BENEFIT FROM THE LIKE FOOD IN DIFFERENT- S. FROM THE INCARCERATED POPULATION SO I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE YOU SPOKE ABOUT THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT UP SENATOR IT'S EXTREMELY WELL AND I'M A BIG RESTORATIVE JUSTICE- ON AVERAGE IT I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I THINK HAVING OFTENTIMES FROM A DEFENSE PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T SPEAK ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FAIR IN ALL. THE TIMES YOU HEAR FROM VICTIMS REYES JR FROM ARM PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY ON CRIMES IN OUR. IN OUR AND COMMUNITIES AND- THEY NEED THAT FOR THEM SO TO ON HIS WAY HE- IN ONE PER- SPOKE ABOUT HI AUBURN- THAT THEY HAD TO SHOOT AMENDS WITH. THE PERSON THAT- ARMS VICTIMIZE DAMAGE IN THE SAID THAT AFTER THAT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO THE MOVE ON THE IN THE IN THE FOUNDER THEY WERE CONTINUING TO VICTIMIZE THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY GOT THAT OPPORTUNITY SO. THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT THINGS HERE NOW WITH THAT BEING SAID DO YOU- DO I THINK. WE ARE WE NEED TO BE ARE WE WANT TO BE AT THE END NO I THINK WE ARE CONTINUE TO DO GOOD THINGS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR OUR OUR LEADERSHIP GROUPS IN THE IN THE FIELD- SUPPORTER INCARCERATED PERSONS IN FIELD. CELEBRATE THE SMALL SUCCESSES THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT YOU VALLEY MAY NOT BE HUMONGOUS THEY ARE IN IN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW ATTENDING GRADUATIONS WHEN I'M AFTER. THE INSTITUTION SPEAKING WITH NOT ONLY OUR STAFF WRITER GROCERY I THINK THAT GOES A LONG WAY. I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONGOING FORWARD SHARK RESEARCH. FOR YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THAT OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU I MEAN NOT NOT TO BE A PROBABLY A BUT ON BEING AT ALL PSYCH MAJORS IT THERE A GREAT. WHICH IS DECADE OLD NOW THE DARK LIKE. THE SKIN. A STEADY THAT WAY AND THE PEOPLE ARE. WITH AN- OF BILL LERNER AND THE WOULD BE. TAKE A LITTLE LONGER THAT YET LAST MUCH LONGER PERHAPS A LIFETIME AND THAT THAT'S I THINK WHAT BUT WHAT THE GOAL IS HERE BUT IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT ONE TO OBTAIN. WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPENT A LIFETIME ON THE WRONG SIDE YOU KNOW OF THE LAW AND- GROWING U IN A SOCIETY THAT. PROBABLY PROMOTES THAT FRANKLY WE KNOW THAT WITH THE GAMES AND- THE GAMES THAT ARE LISTED IN HERE YOU GOT YOUR RYAN RYAN NATION. AS NUMBER ONE- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WAS PUT ON THE TOP I THOUGHT THAT WAS. PERHAPS NOT ACCURATE BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF THE LONG TERM. GAINS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE ARE ALL DIFFERENT. WALKS OF LIFE- AND- WHAT CRIME THEY'RE INVOLVED WITH THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL EQUAL AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE A VERY DOMINANT ROLE INSIDE THE PRISON WALLS SO THEY WOULDN'T BE HIGH ON REHABILITATION BECAUSE THEY STILL WANT TO MAINTAIN POWER SO YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. VERY AWARE OF THAT. THAT LAST QUESTION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT THE FOLKS THAT YOU ARE LETTING OUT WITH A- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ORIGINALLY AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND. SO WHAT SORT OF SCREENING IS DONE IN TERMS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HOOTERS WHO SUPPOSEDLY ARE HAVING THEIR SENTENCES REDUCED BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN. THREE REBEL ATTACK REHABILITATION- AND HAVE A GOOD CREDIT FOR. THAT ARE MANY OF THEM ARE IN THERE BECAUSE THEY USE GUNS. IT USED TO BE USED AGAIN GO TO GO TO PRISON. AND IT WHERE THOSE PEOPLE ARE OUT AND THEY STILL HAVE THE ACCESS TO. A GUN- ILLEGAL GUNS- THAT IS VERY TROUBLING THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE. PLAYING THE GAME YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PER SO OF THESE P. WHO ARE. REALLY WANTING TO. BE REAL BILL IN TO GET BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE BUT YOU GO A PURSE. OF USING A BELL CURVE WHICH IS USED WITH MANY OF THE STUDIES. THERE ARE THOSE WHO PLAINLY GAMING THE SYSTEM. IT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE SCREENING THAT'S DONE ON THE RELEASE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. ARE TO REALLY DIG DEEPER IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR CRIMES WERE IN THEIR ACCESS TO GUNS. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF SCREENING YOU DO THAT'S ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE YOU TO INCLUDE. ON THE FILE YOU KNOW INFORMATION GOING TO. PROVIDE AND- YOU KNOW REQUEST OF OUR PRO TEM. THAT IS WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO COVER. WHAT SORT OF SCREENING IS DONE. WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THE MULTIPLE CRIMES MAYBE OFFENSE ENHANCEMENTS. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNPOPULAR PRESENTLY BUT IF YOU GOT A SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT FOR USING A GUN AND YOU KILLED SOMEBODY WITH THAT. THEM TO ME THAT PERSON GET OR THE BACK OF THE LINE IN TERMS A GOOD CREDIT. BECAUSE THAT. FRANKLY THEY HAVE ACCESS. AND THEY KNOW HOW TO GET HIM. AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF GRIEVANCES ARE THEY'RE GOING TO FATAL AND THERE ARE. MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY YOU KNOW THROUGH THE GAME'S AFFILIATION. ABOUT FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY- COMMUNICATING WITH OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON WALLS. SO THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW BUT IF YOU WOULD INCLUDE. A DISCUSSION IN YOUR LETTER OF WHAT SORT OF SCREENING IS DONE ON. MULTIPLE pENHANCEMENT. IT IS YOU. HI COMMITTEE A CRIME. THIS TAKING LIFE FOR. BY ENTRY. OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND YOU'RE IN THERE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN THERE THREE TIMES FOR THE SAME CRIME. I THINK A LOT MORE A DEEPER DIVE ON WHETHER THAT PERSON CAN REALLY BE. REHABILITATED IN THE SHORT TERM HI IT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THIS OR WE WILL NOT GET THE PUBLIC. ON BOARD WITH. THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE APPROACH AND BEING COMFORTABLE THAT WE'RE NOT LETTING PEOPLE. YOU KNOW OUT OF PRISON NOW GOING TO LIVE NEXT DOOR TO THEM. AND BECAUSE ARE PRESENTING SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT DANGER TO THEM. THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITY AND YOUR HEARING THAT A LOT I'M SURE. SO I WILL YOU KNOW AND WITHOUT. AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL PROVIDE FROM DEEPER DISCUSSION ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES I WILL ENSURE THAT- THE STAFF CONNECTS WITH YOU TO MORE SPECIFICALLY MAKE SURE- THAT WE GET THAT ARTICULATED- SO THAT- MISSILES ON A WILL BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO IT.

WE HAVE ALL THE CONCERN THAT INMATES ARE TREATED A CERTAIN WAY INCARCERATED AND WE ALSO HAVE EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE YOU KNOW SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC AND OF OTHERS IS PARAMOUNT AND YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT CHARGE IT AS ADMINISTRATION- WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD WITHIN OUR OWN. INSTITUTION HERE IN THE SENATE TO CHANGE ISSUES OF CULTURE AROUND EXPECTATIONS OF- YOU KNOW RESPECT RESPECT AND SUPPORT FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IN THE DIVERSITY THAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR OWN RANKS AND HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER.
