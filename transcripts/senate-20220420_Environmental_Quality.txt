THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO AND WE JUST ASK OUR- OUR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES- FROM THE COMMITTEE TO COME UNDER. SO S. B. THIRTEEN. EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- PRESENTING SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH WILL DANCE EQUITY MEASURES IN THE STATE'S CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM. CURRENTLY WHITE HIGHER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO PHONE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR AS SPORT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN COMMUNITIES OVERBURDENED BY MISSIONS. THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM IS SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO. ADDRESS THE EXISTING INEQUITY IN ACCESS TO CLEAN ZERO EMISSION AND HYBRID VEHICLES OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS CLEAN CARS FOR ALL HAS PLACED. DOESN'T ZERO EMISSION AND HYBRID VEHICLES INTO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS REPLACING OLDER HEAVY POLLUTING. VEHICLES SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TO BUILD OFF THE SUCCESS OF THE EXISTING CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THE- OF THIS HEAVILY OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAM MUST ALSO BE MADE MORE ACCESSIBLE- IT WILL. LOWER COSTS AT THE COST TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM EXEMPTING CARS BOUGHT AND SOLD THROUGH THE PROGRAM FROM STATE SALES TAX WEAVING THREE POINT NINETY FOUR PERCENT. TAX TO MAKE THE PROGRAM MORE AFFORDABLE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE ALLEN ADDS. LEGISLATIVE OFFICER FOR THE BAY AREA. QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THE FIRST WE'LL START WITH BILL MCGOVERN POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. GIVE MUCH. AND AN MR CHAN BILL MCKAY WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO. CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL ONE. IN THE DISTRICTS WHERE IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED. AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR MANY YEARS TO DEMOCRATIZE THE ELECTRIC CAR. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE SUFFERING THE WORST IMPACTS OF AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND HISTORIC DISINVESTMENT. HAVE ACCESS TO THE CLEANEST TRANSPORTATION AND THAT'S WHAT CLEAN CARS FOR ALL DOES. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROGRAM AND I THINK IT REALLY WOULD RESPOND TO. SOME POINTS WERE MADE LAST YEAR BY THE UCLA LUSKIN CENTER FOR INNOVATION. WHICH FOUND THAT THE INTENT AND EFFICACY OF OUT REACH TO POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURE BOTH PROCEDURAL AND DISTRIBUTIVE EQUITY. AND RECOMMENDED THE INSTITUTION OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE BASED TARGETS FOR ADVANCING DISTRIBUTIVE- BUT YOU US IN THE XIN AND BREAK DOWN BARRIERS. TO PARTICIPATION IN THIS IMPORTANT EQUITY BASED PROJECT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CARE ALLEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M ALLEN APPS WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO AND TO EXPLAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM IN THE BAY AREA. TO SUPPORT EQUITY IN ADVANCING A CLEAN CAR FUTURE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL IS RETIRING REPLACE PROGRAM INCOME QUALIFIED RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED AT POLLUTION CAN TURN AN OLDER VEHICLE. GET AN INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE OR LEASE A HYBRID PLUG IN HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAT IS EIGHT YEARS OLDER NEWER. PARTICIPANTS MUST HAVE INCOME THAT IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL CONSUMERS OUGHT TO HAVE THE OPTION RECEIVE LOCAL THING FOR MOBILITY OPTIONS THAT ALLOW GRANTEES. DEV CARD WEBER OUR A ANSWERED THE PUBLIC PROTECTION GRANT SLOW BILLETE OPTION CAN ALSO USE THESE FUNDS TO. ELECTRIC BY IN THE- IN THE THREE THAT THERE. THE HAS MINISTERED THIS PROBE WE HAVE. ABSOLUTELY TWENTY FIVE B. PURCHASE. WITH TWO THIRDS OF THOSE OCCURRING IN OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY WE AVERAGE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED VEHICLE PURCHASE THIS MONTH. OLD INCOMING VEHICLE CHOSEN DETERMINES MOUNT. RISK PROGRAM WITH GRANT. FROM. HUNDRED A DOLLARS TO ON IT. YOUR GOAL. BUT THE CLEAN FOR VEHICLES KERN COSTS TWENTY THE DOLLARS. THE AVERAGE CARS FOR ALL IN CENTER IS A FIVE DOLLAR. AN AVERAGE LOW SIGNING FOR. A REPLACE VEHICLE IS FOURTEEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THUS IT STILL REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE FOR MOST ELIGIBLE ACT APPLICANTS. PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE OR LIMITING THE TAX BURDEN ON INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM WOULD HELP EXPAND THE APPLICANT POOL REDUCE PARTICIPANT COSTS. AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S EQUITY IN ZERO EMISSION GOALS. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO ALSO DIRECTS CARPET COORDINATE WITH AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND LOCAL NONPROFIT AND COMMUNITY. TO IDENTIFY. AND QUEEN CREEK CARS FUNDING AND DEVELOP OUTREACH PRO AND METRICS TO ASSESS THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. FURTHER SUPPORTING EQUITY WITHIN THIS PROGRAM WE THANK SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BEEN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE.

I JUST WANT TO KNOW. THE AUTHORS ON PAGE SIX AND SEVEN WE TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT FEATURES THIS IS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY A GROWING PROGRAM AS START UP INTO DISTRICTS WITH THE FIVE. AND WE SEE HOW THE- THE SOUTH COAST THOSE THINGS WITH THE TEN NINETY NINE AND IN OTHERS. ALL THE AIR DISTRICTS OUR LOCAL. DOING DIFFERENT PROCEDURES SAID TO FIND OUT WHO'S ELIGIBILITY ELIGIBLE. RIVERSIDE HOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO- GENERALIZE IT ALERTS ARE CONSOLIDATE THINGS OR REORGANIZING THAT EVERYBODY'S DOING THE SAME THING BECAUSE ALL THIRTY FIVE THESE DISTRICTS OKAY WITH WITH INCREDIBLE INDULGENCE I JUST WOULD LOVE TO ESTABLISH A CORNBALL QUICKLY BECAUSE WE DO IT WITH ME THANK TERMS ARE BILL I'M SO SORRY SEVERAS AS I WOULD NORMALLY DO THIS BUT WE'RE IN A TIGHT SPOT. I AM ESPECIALLY PLEASED PLEASED TO CLEAR UP PLEASE THAT STOPS A QUORUM ALLEN HERE BATES DOLLY SALLY HERE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ HERE SKINNER STERN. BY CASKEY HERE. OKAY WE DO HAVE A VEGAS DOLLARS I LET'S BE YEAH I'M I DO APOLOGIZE. WHICH FEATURES THAT NOW BEING USED AT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC REGIONAL AIR QUALITY WORDS YOU'D LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN BE EMULATED N THE OTHERS AS WE GO FROM. TWO TO FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE YOUR DISTRICTS. SAY THAT AGAIN I APOLOGIZE WHAT SPECIFIC PROGRAM FEATURES YOU KNOW SOME SOME PROGRAM SAY BRINGING YOUR TEN NINETY NINE AND WE'RE GONNA SHOW THAT YOU GOT PROOF THAT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE- WE GOT THIRTY FIVE DISTRICTS THE ROLE. INDEPENDENT AND ALL HAVE THEIR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SOPHISTICATION SALES SOUTH COAST IS BEGAN A BEERY IS AGGRESSIVE. I ACCEPT- UP AT THE AT THE OTHER LITTLE ONES AS WE MOVE OUT TO THOSE FOLKS WHAT WHAT PROGRAMS WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS WORKING. AS WELL THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST ONE ISSUE ON- THE STATE SALES TAX THAT WE'VE TALKED TO ME AT LENGTH AND NOW AND ARE. WORKING GROUP ABOUT WHAT TO BE REFORMED IN TERMS OF EVEN LANGUAGE ACCESS THE- THE TEN EIGHTY NINE FORM IS VERY HODGEPODGE DEPENDING ON WHICH YOUR DISTRICT YOU GO TO BUT- THAT IS A FEDERAL ISSUE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT I'M JUST SORT OF HOLISTICALLY TO SEE IF WE CAN. REFORM THAT SETS MARC MORE CONSISTENT- BUT I WOULD ALSO DEFERRED TO- THE STRAPS YOU MISTER MCEVERS. WEALTH THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL- INPUT FROM THEM AND WHAT ELSE BE DONE THE FULL LOCAL AIR. SURE THING JUST BRIEFLY I MEAN I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE SOME OUTREACH TECHNIQUES THAT ARE THAT ARE WORKING WELL IN SUMMER DISTRICTS THAT COULD PROBABLY BE EXPORTED TO OTHERS PARTICULARLY. THOSE THAT ARE THE MOST COMMUNITY BASED THAT ARE REACHING SOME OF THE HARDEST TO REACH POPULATIONS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FARMWORKERS. UNITIES AND I THINK YOU KNOW THIS BILL DOESN'T PRE JUDGE BECAUSE IT WOULD ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR EVALUATION. BUT I THINK THERE ARE SUCCESS STORIES TO COULD BE EMULATED YEAH AND SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING IS THAT THAT A COUPLE WHERE DISTRICTS. ISSUE TEN NINETY NINE SO THESE- CLEAN CARS FOR ALL REWARDS ARE BEING TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME AND IN OUR OPINION THEY SHOULD NOT BE- THE CVR. IS NOT TREATED AS TAX INCOME SO THAT'S A ANY CONSISTENCY THIS QUITE GLARING RIGHT WHAT THE NEW. NEW RULES FROM THE AIRPORT IN FEBRUARY ON THE CPR CARE SAID SHRINKING WORLD OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE I'D- BACK I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYBODY WHO'S ELIGIBLE RECEIVE THE RP DECIDE ELIGIBLE FOR CREDIT CARDS FOR ALL. MY HOPE THERE IS THERE THERE'S- ACTUALLY IT'S A- INTERN FOR THOU DOLLAR. VERSUS A HUNDRED DOLLARS SAID YOU KNOW SO THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE. THAT CONSISTENCY THAT IS THAT'S NOT THIS BILL THAT'S ANOTHER BILL RIGHT. OKAY YEAH I GUESS. MY CAN AS A IT'S SPREAD OUT IN THE- THAT IS THAT YES GOOD TO DO OUTRAGE AND GET THE OUTREACH MULTIPLE. FOR YOU STILL HAVE HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY ST ON WHAT THE THEY DID THE ELIGIBILITY WHAT BECAUSE I THINK. THERE'S A- IF THERE'S A CRITICISM IS JUST WERE BEEN TOO CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT QUALIFIED TO GET THE TO GET THE INCENTIVES. AND THEN FIND OUT LATER ON THAT DAY THAT THEY OWE IT AND I DON'T. KNOW IF THAT'S WELL THAT'S- THAT'S MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE OF HOW- SLOPE. THINGS HAVE GONE OKAY- YEAH D. AND THE SALES TAX IS AT THE POINT OF SALE RIGHT THAT'S YES THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S AND WE CAN WORK WITH THE DEALERS THAT THEY WOULD STILL BE A SET UP AND THEN AND THEN TECHNICALLY THEY WOULD JUST GO WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD RIGHT TO WE PAY THE SOURCE SAID WHAT VEHICLE SESSION RIGHT THERE'S NOT. WE DON'T WANT TO MARK THIS UP WITH THE AIRPORT IS NOT GONNA HANDLE SALES TAX THAT SHOULD BE A DIRECT TRANSFER. BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY DON'T TOUCH IT ANYWAY. HI I'M OF THE BILL GREAT THANK YOU AS WELL SO YEP THEY'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE BILL. OKAY THE MEDIA CENTER STERN. JUST A QUICK COMMENT BUILDING ON THE MY GOOD SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS COMMENTS BUT- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD WORK FROM EARLY DAYS- WITH SOME OF YOUR BILL SPONSORS HERE ON GETTING THIS PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING AND LAW A YEAR AGO AND UP AND RUNNING I MEAN THAT THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION IS THAT. THIS THIS ASSESSMENT I MEAN WHAT WE ASK THE- BOARD TO DO IN TERMS OF SETTING SPECIFIC GOALS. THEN THE PERFORMANCE FROM THE AIR DISTRICTS- YOU KNOW SOUTH COAST IS NOT AS GOOD AT SELLING CARS IN LEASING CARS IS LIKE CARVE. CAR COMPANIES- AND IT SHOWS IT'S NOT I MEAN THEY'RE GOOD REGULATORS OR OR AND THEY- WE WANT THEM TO DO MORE. OF THAT AIR QUALITY REGULATION BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUAL OUT REGION SENDING OUT POSTCARDS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE TEN DEGREES MISTER MCGOVERN I WOULD JUST SAY FOR THE FUTURE. YOU KNOW. REALLY CENTRALIZED TOP DOWN METRICS WITH. LAKE SET WITH EASY ACCESSIBLE FINANCING AND INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND NOT BE PATCHWORK BUT THEN VERY DEEP DIVE ON COMMUNITY BASED VERY VERY GRASSROOTS TRINITY OUTREACH SITE. BECAUSE BY A CAR IS A BIG THING. TO DO AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW A LOT OF MONEY IT'S A IT'S USUALLY THE BIGGEST ASSET YOU OWN ADDRESS. AND SO WE KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OVER A BIG HUMP HERE BUT I THINK. YEAH I JUST APPLAUD YOU FOR PUT YOUR SHOULDER THE WHEEL ON THIS AND- HE SAID TO SUPPORT- SIGN ON IF APPROPRIATORS THEIR AMENDMENTS COMING THROUGH I'D LOVE TO SIGN ON BUT- YET THIS IS. BEEN A LONG TIME COMING SO THIS IS THE YEAR I THINK WE GOT TO. FIX THIS ALL UP AND SCALE SO I'D SAY NOT SOON ENOUGH. OKAY ALL RIGHT WE'VE BEEN A MUCH OF THE MEASURE BEEN MOVED THAT SAN WE LIKE TO CALL. ON IT THANK. THERMIC AVENUE MISTER ABSTRUSE HERE EVERYONE SPOKEN TO. I LOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM- TO CONTINUE THIS. DISTRICT I RESPECTFULLY ASK AN IBM SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL RIGHT. AS VEHICLE. ITEM NUMBER ONE SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO BY SENATOR GONZALEZ. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE ALLEN. AYE ALLEN AYE BATES. DOLLY GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ ICE SKINNER STERN AYE STERN AYE AYE CASKEY AYE CASKEY AYE. BILL HAS FOUR VOTES. OKAY GREAT ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA I ALSO WE LEAVE IT OPEN EARLY AND CLOSE IT TO SENATE OVER IS THAT IS DO WE WANT TO CLOSE ARE ALL. SO I'M- OUR THOUGHT IS THAT WE CLOSE THE WRONG EVEN THOUGH DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER COMMITTEES BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON IF YOU'RE CALLING TO MILLIE I'M HAPPY TO KEEP THE ROLL UP AND- IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT WE CAN. WE CAN CLOSE IT. WHEN YOU NEED TO MOVE. SO CLOSER YEAH OKAY ALL RIGHT SO WE WILL CLOSE THE ROLE ON SB THIRTY NEED TO OBVIOUSLY MEMBERS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY VOTE ON THIS BILL LATER ON IN THE PRICE STRUCTURE I ASKED THAT THE MEASURE BE EXPEDITED TO THE GOVERNMENT FINANCE COMMITTEE- WITHOUT WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY YEAH SEE YOU'RE MAKING A DIFFERENCE SENATORS GOOD. ALL RIGHT SO WE WILL WE'LL CLOSER- EXPEDITED ITS DELIVERY I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT MASON WAS GONNA DRINK A GATORADE BEFORE THEY GO OR A COKE- OKAY. SO I. NOW THE FUNNY THING IS THOUGH I MEAN THE ISSUE IS I SUPPOSE THAT- WE DON'T HAVE OTHER AUTHORS HERE AT LET'S HAVE THE SINISTER AND YOU WANT TO. WE WANT TO PRESENT- I HAS BEEN PRESENTED BY DODD- OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR- ITEM TWELVE A- SB ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR YEAH SURE EVEN THOUGH- HOW CAN PEOPLE. HUCAL OKAY- THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS- I'M PRESENTING SP FORTINO FOR- FOUR X- BEGIN MY PRESENTATION WHEN IT. EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS LIST ON PAGE FIVE. AND THEN I ALSO UNDERSTAND I DO THE TIMING THAT AMENDMENT WELL IF YOU MADE IN THE SUBSEQUENT COMMITTEE WHICH MY COMMITTEE OVER AND SENT OUT TO RESEARCH AND WATER SO- JUST WANNA MAKE THAT NOTE AND THEN ALSO WANT TO. I'VE HAD REALLY GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH- COMMITTEE STAFF- STAKEHOLDERS AND- THE CHAIR IN PARTICULAR- AND I JUST WANT TO COMMIT NOW TO. SOME ALTERNATIVE A PRECONDITION THAT WILL MORE NARROWLY CONSTRAIN THIS BILL TO STILL ADEQUATELY PROTECT OAK WOODLANDS BUT TO REALLY EMPHASIZE HERE IS A MAP BY STATE OR LOCAL AGENCIES- THAT ARE CRITICAL HABITAT LINKAGE OR NATURAL RESOURCES OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION SO I'M I'M HOPING WE CAN WORK THROUGH SOME OF THAT AND I APPRECIATE HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION- COMING FORWARD AND HAVING THAT DISCUSSION BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THAT SETTLED IN SENATE NATURAL RESOURCE AND WATER SO. THE BILL DOESN'T FEEL TOO OPEN ENDED FOR FOLKS BUT I JUST WANTED YOU KNOW VERY SIMPLY SAY THAT- RIGHT NOW. MORE THAN 30% OF PRE SETTLEMENT OAK WOODLANDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CLEARED THEY'RE GONE- AND WE MADE WAY FOR VERY IMPORTANT USES LIKE AGRICULTURE AND- YES- YES NO CLOSE SHOULD I NOT BE PRESENTING THIS TO WHAT THE OTHER ONE. OKAY WHEN YOU DECIDE IN A DIFFERENT ORDER- THE EDUCATE HERB SOME MORE MOREOVER CALIFORNIA TREES ARE THREATENED BY DISEASE- INVASIVES AND THIS IS REALLY PROVIDING A CRUCIAL STEP IN STANDARDIZING PROTECTIONS WE'VE SEEN A SORT OF PATCHWORK OF PERMITTING AND- AND A LACK OF RECOGNITION FOR THE BROADER ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS OF OAK WOODLANDS- WE KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN CASES THIS ONE TO ONE OAK TREE MITIGATION POLICY JUST DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IF YOU'RE- YOU'RE CUTTING DOWN I'M- THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A HABITAT AREA AND RE PLANTING A SAPLING TWENTY MILES AWAY- IT REALLY DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR THE BROADER. BENEFITS IN THE MITIGATION PATTERNS THAT WE'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE- THROUGH THAT ECOSYSTEM SERVICE THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM AN OAK WOODLAND AND SO RIGHT NOW THE BILL HAS A THREE. THE SPECIFIES THE ON THE REMOVAL OF A CERTAIN THRESHOLD THE TREES TO TRIGGER THAT SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT BUT I DID SHARE IN MY OPENING REMARKS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN CONSTRAINING THAT ONLY WITHIN AREAS THAT HAVE THAT SORT OF HABITAT. CONNECTIVITY VALUE- SO THE ILL THOUGH DOES NOT STOP DEVELOPMENT COUNTRY TO SOME OF THE- THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS IT WOULD NOT HOLD DEVELOPMENT EVEN IF YOU DID HAVE- OAK WOODLANDS ON YOUR PROPERTY. I'M THERE ARE VARIOUS MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE OFFERED FOR THAT CONSERVATION- CONSERVATION EASEMENTS. I'M AN APPROPRIATE PLANTING. A NUMBER- AND REPLACEMENT PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO JUST A ONE FOR ONE- AND OTHER MEDICATIONS CAN BE DEVELOPED BY LEAD AGENCIES BUT ONE TO ONE TREE REPLACEMENT ALONE WE THAT WE THINK CAN ONLY FULFIL- ABOUT HALF THE TOTAL MITIGATION EFFORTS JUST GIVEN THE TIME SPAN OF THESE TREES AND THE VALUE THEY PROVIDE AND THAT THE AGENT TAKES TO ACTUALLY GET A SAPLING TO A FULL OF WHEAT WE KNOW THE THIS IS THE STORY OF. AN ACORN FALLING- AND BECOMING A MIGHTY OAK BUT IT SEEK WAS TIMELINE ISN'T THE SAME AS NATURE'S AND SO- WE THINK IS THIS MEASURES CRITICAL TO PROTECTING WHAT REMAINING HABITAT WE HAVE LEFT ESPECIALLY IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND WE WANNA BE RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS OF VARIOUS LOCALITIES SO- ME TODAY HERE IS DANCE OVER FROM THE INJURED HABITATS LEE CALLING IN REMOTELY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I THINK ALSO. NICK JENSEN MAYBE HEAR FROM NAY TO SAY. THANK WHEN IS PROCEED. MOTOR YOU COULD YOU PLEASE QUEUE UP THE- THE FOLKS WHO ARE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF FOURTEEN OH FOUR I GUESS DAN SILVER IN NICK JENSEN. I DO NOT SHOW EITHER OF THEM HAVE THOUSAND YES OKAY ALL RIGHT. DO WE HAVE- FOLKS ONE OF VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL- IN PERSON HERE OR ON ONLINE ON ON ON THE PHONE LINES. MODERATOR. HIM FOR THOSE ON THE PHONE LINE IF YOU LIKE TO SPEAK WITH SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN OH FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO ONE ONE ZERO FOUR SUPPORT. AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN OUR QUEUE. OKAY ALL RIGHT- LET'S GO TO OPPOSITION- SILVIA FERRARI JOHN KENNEDY I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GONNA. RAISE OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SILVIO FOR OUR IN BATH CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION- AFTER HEARING WHAT SENATOR STERN SAID ABOUT AMENDMENTS COMING THE BILL WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET AN INVITATION AND TO WORK ON THOSE WITH YOU AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THIS CAN POTENTIALLY GO. I'LL JUST SUMMARIZE OUR BIG THREE CONCERNS NUMBER ONE SETTING A STATE WIDE LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE- THAT IS VERY CONCERNING BECAUSE YOU ALL KNOW THERE IS NO SINGLE PART OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS THE SAME WHETHER IT'S- CLIMATIC GEOGRAPHIC TOPOGRAPHIC HABITAT AREAS WE DON'T HAVE TO PARTS OF THE STATE BETTER SAME SO. WE'VE EVEN SEEN. CONTACTS V. M. T. B. AND ONE OF THEM EVEN AGENCIES LIKE OPR HAVE RESISTED SETTING A STATEWIDE LEVEL A SIGNIFICANT SO WE CAUTION YOU AND WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON THAT AS WELL. NUMBER TWO- WE GOTTA HAVE LEAD AGENCIES REALLY DRIVING THE SHIP ON. I KNOW THOSE AREAS THE REMOVING THEM FROM THAT IS TROUBLESOME- AND LASTLY AND POSSIBLY MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BILL STRIKES HE WON. AND HE WON IS AN EXISTING PROVISION THAT INSURERS AT WHAT THE MITIGATION MEASURES ARE THAT THE- LEAD AGENCY COMES UP WITH WHEN WE COMPLY WITH THEM WE ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE FOR DEEMED. FOR PORTION APPLIES THE OAK AND OAK WOODLANDS- MEDICATION THAT IS A PROTECTION THAT HAS BEEN IN THERE IT HAS WORKED WELL WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT SO WE WOULD ASK THE KIND OF THOSE THREE THINGS AS WE MOVE FORWARD KINDA BE. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING JOHN KENNEDY WITH A RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THIRTY NINE WORLD COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE POSE SB FOURTEEN OH FOUR BECAUSE AS IT WAS SAID IMPOSES A ONE SIZE FITS ALL REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE STATE REGARDLESS OF LOCAL DIVERSITY- AND A DIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND OPENS THE DOOR TO EVEN MORE SEQUEL LITIGATION OAKS IN WOODLANDS- ABUNDANT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND NOT AT SERIOUS RISK OF CONVERSION AND MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES THERE ARE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION TREES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SPREAD OUT OVER FIFTEEN MILLION ACRES OF OAK WOODLANDS AND OAK FOREST AND YET THIS BILL ESTABLISHES AN ARBITRARY STANDARD OF THREE TREES THAT ARE IMPACTED AND CUT DOWN REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE PROJECT WHETHER IT'S A HOUSING PROJECT SAFETY PROJECT THE PARKER IMPROVE PROJECT ANYTHING. AND AS WAS SAID SEQUEL- ALREADY- REQUIRES COUNTIES TO MITIGATE THE PROJECT'S IMPACTS ON OAK WOODLANDS. SO WE DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR THE BILL WE DON'T SEE THE FLAWS WITH THE EXISTING PROGRAM- AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL ELIMINATES A VERY IMPORTANT SAFE HARBOR. SO IF WE DO GO IN AND REQUIRE MEDICATION FOR PROJECTS IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THOSE PROJECTS OF AN INSULATED FROM SEQUEL LITIGATION CHALLENGING THE ADEQUACY OF THE- EVALUATION AND ADEQUACY OF THOSE MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL THROWS THAT OUT THE DOOR AND ALLOWS GROUPS TO COME IN AND CHALLENGE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR DETERMINATION AND THE ADEQUACY OF OUR MITIGATION MEASURES. THEREBY EXTENDING PROJECT TIMELINES INCREASED. OBJECTING THEM TO LITIGATE THESE ARE THE THAT WE CAN'T. SO LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS I THINK HELP BY FOCUSING LESS ON. THE AGENCIES AND THE PUBLIC RIGHT RIGHT THANK YOU YEAH. YEP OKAY. THANK YOU MRS FOR IN KENNEDY- OKAY LET'S. LET'S GO TO THE ANYONE HERE IN PERSON WANTS TO RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. IS SB FORTINO FOR. HI FOLKS ON THE PHONE LINES ID LIKE TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT IT FOURTEEN FOR VOICE OPPOSITION. MODERATOR GEN THE GERMAN THE FEEL JUST CAN THEIR OWN. FIRST WE HAVE LINE NUMBER FOURTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME IS DOUG CARSTENS I'M ACTUALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I PRESSED ONE ZERO TOO LATE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR IT PLEASE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING THIS IS KELLY CALIFORNIA REALTORS IN OPPOSITION AS THE BILL CURRENTLY WRITTEN. YES. AND I HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU OKAY GREAT- OKAY I WANTED TO START BY MAKING A COUPLE OF COMMENTS I MEAN I THINK- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE I'VE I WANT TO START BY SAYING AND THAT I. TOTALLY UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE DESIRE TO PROTECT OAK WOODLANDS AND THEY'RE VERY VERY SPECIAL PART OF OUR- ECOLOGY IN OUR BIODIVERSITY HERE. IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY- LIVE IN IN WHILE I'M UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND WEST SACRAMENTO- IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF A SACRAMENTO WHERE THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL OAK WOODLAND THAT WAS KIND OF. THEIR CLEARLY I'VE GOT AN OLD GROWTH OAK IN MY BACKYARD. AND AND SO NICE ABOUT HOW HOW HOW THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO PRESERVE SO MUCH OF THE WOMEN EVEN AS THEY BUILD HOMES IN THE IN THE AREA. HI I'M- SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY LOFTY GOAL I THINK THEY'RE A GOOD CALL I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE SLEW OF I THINK THIS THREE. OAK TREE. I AND NUMBER JUST DOES SEEM A BIT ARBITRARY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT COMES FROM YEAH FIVE TREES TWO TREES WHAT WHAT WHAT'S SIGNIFICAN ABOUT THREE- AND I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE THRESHOLD ITS POTENTIAL IMPACTS I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS- MISTER. MISTER AUTHOR- TO EXPLORE DURING THE APPLICATION THE THREE TREE THRESHOLD ON TO CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE ESPECIALLY AREAS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO HABITAT LINKAGE. AT THE VERY LEAST YOU ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IS. HAVING A SUPPLY NATIONAL RECREATION AREAS- I THINK THAT WOULD BE ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT LOGICAL SENSITIVITY THOSE REGIONS- I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO LIMIT TO. ARE IS CRITICAL TO HAVE THAT LINK IS NOT RESOURCES- BUT I STILL THINK THAT THE- THE CURRENT CONTEXT AT THE END OF THE WITH THE WEIGHTS FRAME THIS IS A BIT TOO BROAD. I'M IN IT BUT I BUT I DO THINK THERE'S A OF A REAL KERNEL OF VALUE HERE- AN ACORN. PERHAPS OF VALUE- AND SO I'M I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY THAT SUPPORTED TODAY AND YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE GONNA KEEP WORKING ON IT IT'S GOING TO GO TO NATURAL RESOURCES- WHERE I SWEAR I SAID- BUT I DO I DO WANT TO JUST VOICE. I'D BUY GET WILL BE LET ME ASK YOU. WHERE DO WE COME UP WITH THE THREE. THREE OAK TREES LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT DID THAT NUMBER COME FROM. I'M SORRY SO YOU'RE ASKING THAT THE THRESHOLD IN THE BILL YEAH- BASED ON SOME MINIMUM THRESHOLD THAT HAS TO BE THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE USING ONE TO ONE TO IS A DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS. THE ENTIRE OAK WOODLAND ECOSYSTEM OF THE GREATER LA AREA. SO THE CURRENT MITIGATION AND DESIGN REVIEW BOARD PROCESS WITHIN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY YOUR- ARE USING- WOULD TREAT TREAT- SORT OF MITIGATION PROCESS THAT THAT LETS YOU SAID SHIRLEY CHIP AWAY AT AN INTERCONNECTED. LINKED HABITAT SYSTEM SO WE HAD TO PICK SOME THRESHOLD THAT DIDN'T ALLOW YOU TO JUST ONE FOR ONE. YOUR PROCESS AND PUT A YOU KNOW REPLACE A HUNDRED YEAR OAK WITH A- ONE YEAR OLD SAPLINGS GONNA TAKE A HUNDRED MORE YEARS AND REYES WHOSE ALL THE FIRES OWN BENEFITS IN THE PROCESS SO. WE HAD TO PICK SOME THRESHOLD OVER ONE YEAH WE WANT TO BE MODEST ABOUT THAT BUT- RECOGNIZING YOU KNOW I AM COMMITTED TO WHAT THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES SUGGEST THOUGH IN TERMS OF. EITHER FINDING ALTERNATIVE THRESHOLD- IN TERMS OF NUMBER FOUR- TO THE TO THE OPPOSITION'S BATON TESTIMONY. YOU KNOW FINDING SOME KIND OF NARROWING THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON. WHAT IS SORT OF A LOCALLY DRIVEN- SENSITIVITIES SO NOT TRYING TO OVERRIDE NECESSARILY THE INPUT. OF A OF A LEAD AGENCY EUROPA LEAGUE JURISDICTION A COUNTY OR CITY. BUT INSTEAD. MY ON EITHER LOCALLY ADOPTED MAPS OR STATEWIDE MAPS THAT HIGHLIGHT THESE AREAS OF CONCERN SO WE ARE INSTANCE IN OUR AREA WE'VE GOT A HABITAT LINKAGE MAP. RIGHT THAT'S IDENTIFIED PARCELS THROUGH SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY THROUGHOUT THE REGION. THAT ARE BETTER. AT RISK AND SO IF YOU TAKE THREE OAK WOODLAND OAK YOU KNOW TREES OUT OF THAT SORT OF INTERCONNECTED WOODLAND YOU ARE GOING TO DO DAMAGE. HOWEVER IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN AN ISOLATED AREA THAT'S CUT OFF FROM OTHER. YOU KNOW IT IS NOT WITHIN A AREA BY DIVERSITY NOT WITHIN IT ASHA NOT WITHIN COASTAL ZONE NOT WITHIN A HABITAT LINKAGE MAP. SORT OF SITTING ON ITS OWN WE DON'T WANT AND WE WANT TO TRIGGER- A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT THAT KIND OF PROPERTY SO. I THINK BY MAKING THAT DELINEATION IN THESE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE GONNA WORK ON WITH YOUR COMMITTEE HERE AND WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND I WOULD READILY INVITE- TO MR FURRIES POINT- AND MR KENNEDY'S POINT. PLEASE COME TO THE TABLE I KNOW WE MET INITIALLY YESTERDAY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT DISCUSSION BUT- WE- DON'T. WE FIFTY AS SOME OF OUR- LITIGATE RISK- AND LOOK WE KNOW THAT ALSO THE I. OURS ARE NOT SET IN STONE ONCE THEY'RE DONE IT'S NOT AS IF YOU'RE COMPLETELY INSULATED FROM RISK ALREADY WE KNOW IN OUR E. I. R. WAS CERTIFIED IN LA RECENTLY TO TRY TO DO ONE FOR ONE THOUGH STRUCK DOWN RIGHT SO IT'S NOT AS IF YOU'RE IMMUNE FROM LITIGATION RISK ONCE YOU'VE COMPLETED YOUR I. R. THAT WAS ONE EXCEPTION I TAKE BUT RIGHT ANYWAY THAT THAT'S- THAT'S THE HOPE FOR THESE BILLS SO. WORK IN PROGRESS IS THAT YOU KNOW THE CLASSIC MONIKER BUT- I WITHOUT OWNERS. I'M I'M I'M I'M ONCE HARRIS FOR THE BILL AND IT CENTER WE CASTING. ON THE- WELL THE STAFF REPORT ASKED THE AUDITOR EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE- THRESHOLDS MIGHT THE AUTHOR BE LOOKING AT THE V. A. E. I. R. SIDE OF IT ON THE MEDICATION BECAUSE WE WE'VE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE ONE THE ONE DOESN'T DOESN'T WORK AND WE- THE STAFF REPORT PULLS OUT THAT THERE ARE MORE SENSITIVE AREAS THE NOT. MIGHT SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT BE LOOKING DEFINING DOES SAYING THERE IS THE MINIMUM MEDICATION IF YOU'RE TAKING OUT OF THIS IS GOING TO BE THIS AND IF YOU TAKE OUT MORE OAKS IS GOING TO BE THAT AND FOR ON THAT. THAT SIDE IT DOESN'T KNOW THE CAN BE AND AN ABSOLUTE NUMBER TWO I MEAN I IF I SEE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO WITH US BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT ARE THE THIS IS A SENSITIVE AREA THIS IS JUST. YOU KNOW SOME RURAL COUNTY THAT'S GOT- AT OAKS THERE AND I AGAIN I IT SEEMS TO ME WERE NOW THE LEAD AGENCY CAN SET THIS MINIMUM THRESHOLD TO SAY THIS IS OUR MITIGATION AND IT MIGHT BE INSTRUCTIVE TO CHANGE THAT. THAT DIRECTION THIS IS YOUR- THE- IF YOU DON'T MIND CAN YOU GIVE ME THAT SO YOU'RE SAYING WITHIN THE E. S. LIKE WITHIN THE RECORD ITSELF WITHIN THE I. R. SAID DON'T TOUCH ON THE THRESHOLD OF SIGNIFICANCE AS WE KNOW SOME THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE CONCERNS WITH SORT OF SETTING THAT IN LAW BUT YOU'RE SAYING SORT OF A NUDGE TOWARDS THE I. R. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS RIGHT WILL JUST SAYING ONE THE ONE MITIGATION IS NOT IS NOT ADEQUATE JUST THIS IS JUST THE START UP IS A THRESHOLD IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT AND IS IT TWO ONE THREE ONE DEPENDING ON WHAT WORK WHERE YOU'RE AT AND ARE YOU LOOKING. ARE YOU RESTORING SENSITIVE CATION FINAL VOTE LIKE TO HAVE AN- CLOSE TO WHERE IT IS. THERE MAY BE BENEFITS OF. OF IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT THE OAK PORTION. TO SAY. HERE'S AN AREA THAT NEEDS REPAIR. AND IF YOU TAKE DOWN FOR. ONCE YOU PUT WE NEED TWENTY SEVEN PLANET HERE AND YES GOOD TAKE A HUNDRED ACRES. A HUNDRED YEARS TO GET THERE BUT THAT. THAT HELPS THAT. RESTORATION PROCESS AT LEAST IT'S SAID IT'S JUST AN IDEA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN IT IS VERY HELPFUL FEEDBACK AND HONESTLY MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK TO AND YOUR CONCERNS NOT MISPLACED SO I'M NOT I DON'T WANT TO DISMISS IT AT ALL AND LET'S BEGIN AND GET TO WORK ON THIS- YEP. I THINK MY QUESTIONS HAVE ANSWERED BUT I THINK RELATIVE TO WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS BRINGING FORWARD ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES I THINK IT BECAUSE AND I KNOW YOU'RE- WORKING ON THE THRESHOLD AND- FIGURING THAT OUT AND- AND TYPES OF. PROJECTS AS WELL IN IN FIGURING OUT YOU KNOW OF COURSE WHAT. THAT COULD LOOK LIKE AND I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT SO. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- I THINK I HEARD A MOTION. FROM SENATORS ALSO YES OKAY ALL RIGHT- AS- YOU MAY CLOSE CENTER. THANK YOU I KNOW YOU KNOW I KNOW IT. WE SORT OF JUMP IN THE ORDER OF THINGS WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM ALL THE TESTIMONY I- AND APOLOGIZE FOR THE TIMING OF ALL THIS AND I HOPE THE NOT JUST THE PROPONENTS BUT ALSO TO THE OPPONENTS NO IF YOU IF YOU WEREN'T HERE TO WHERE. WE STILL DO WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU SO EXPECT- BUT LET'S HAVE SOME DISCUSSIONS BEFORE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCE AND WATER- I WOULD SEND THAT SIGNAL TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HABITAT LINKAGE MAPS- AS WELL AS FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS. OVERLAYS IN THEIR- STATEWIDE MAPPING THAT COULD PROVIDE ALSO SOME OTHER NARROWING PRINCIPLES AND I- AND THEN I WILL TAKE TO HEART CENTER WHITE HOUSE SKIS A SUGGESTION AROUND WHAT WHAT SHOULDN'T COUNT FOR ADEQUATE MITIGATION BUT NOT NECESSARILY- BEING SO SURGICAL ABOUT. WHAT MUST COUNT- SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD GUY POSE FOR GOING FORWARD AND APPRECIATE. THE DIFFERENCE THE COMMITTEE AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU CENTER- SECRETARY PLEASE COLOR. I THE NUMBER THIRTY. SB FORTINO FOR BY SENATOR STERN. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER ALAN HI ALAN HI BATES. DOLLY GONZALEZ AND SALAS I SKINNER. STERN AYE STERN AYE WIECKOWSKI. WE KEEP. SORRY LET'S GO LET'S GO AHEAD OF BELOW SIXTY FOUR OKAY LET'S DO ITEM TWELVE- OKAY. THIS YEAR A NEWMAN HEY MAN MY NAME IS NEWMAN LET'S DO THIS- YES ITEM NINE YOU'RE VERY WELCOME AND. BACK AT IT AGAIN WOULD RECITE WITH BATTERY RECYCLING WHEN ISSUE I APPRECIATE YOU GETTING INVOLVED WITH. THAT'S THAT'S AN ENCOURAGING OF WAY TO STRETCH OF THE EXCELLENT. MISTER CHAIR IN MEMBERS I AM HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF S. B. TWELVE FIFTEEN WHICH WOULD% CREATE A CONVENIENCE STATEWIDE PRODUCER FUNDED COLLECTION AND RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR LOOSE AND PRODUCT EMBEDDED BATTERIES BEFORE  BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S MEMBERS. AND THANK THE CONSULTANT- FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT SHE MAY BE THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THOSE ACROSS TO THE JURORS THE BATTERIES CONTAIN CALIFORNIA CLASSIFIES BATTERIES HAZARDOUS WASTE AND EXPOSE THE BANS THE DISPOSAL OF BATTERIES AND SOLID WASTE. LANDFILLS AS A CONSEQUENCE CONSUMERS ARE EXPECTED TO SAVE IN STORE EXPENDED BRASSERIES IN UNNEEDED PORTABLE ELECTRONICS AND FIND INAPPROPRIATE DISPOSAL OPTION THIS ENFORCEMENT TENDS TO BE MORE THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE SINCE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY LACKS A STREAMLINED AND CONVENE A COLLECTION AND RECYCLING SYSTEM. FOR BATTERIES CONSIDERING THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THE SAFETY ISSUES AROUND BATTERIES THIS IS OBVIOUSLY LESS THAN IDEAL- I WOULD ASK YOU ALL AS A POINT OF REFERENCE IN YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT BATTERIES THINK ABOUT ALL THE DOUBLE A. AND TRIPLE A. AND OTHER TYPES OF BATTERIES THAT YOU CYCLE THROUGH. IN A YEAR POWER IN ALL THE MANY DEVICES THAT ARE SO DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN OUR THOROUGHLY MODERN LIVES ALL THE REMOTE CONTROLS COMPUTER KEYBOARDS THE MICE THE CLOCKS BY SLICE YOUR KIDS TOYS IT GOES ON AND ON. I NOW THINK ABOUT ALL THE RHETORICAL DEVICES THAT ARE PRECARIOUSLY. WELL EACH ONE WITH RHETORICAL BATTERY NOW MULTI SIXPENNY BATTERIES BY CALIFORNIA POPULATION JUST UNDER FORTY MILLION PEOPLE- AND THEN. CHALLENGING IT IS. TO STOP THE ALL OF THOSE BETTER. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER. THE FACT THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO UNIFIED CONVENE SYSTEM AND FOR CAL. FOR TWO SO. NOW CONSIDER THIS IMPORTANT AN ALARMING FACT AS WELL. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE MILLIONS OF BATTERIES CONTAINS HAZARDOUS. TOXIC AND CORROSIVE MATERIALS LIKE MERCURY CADMIUM LITHIUM AND LET. WHEN IMPROPERLY DISCARDED BATTERIES POSE A SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD WHEN BATTERIES ARE TOSSED INTO THE TRASH INSTEAD OF BEING PROPERLY RECYCLED. THE END UP IN LANDFILLS WITH. B. AND LEAK IS TYPICAL BATTERIES CORRODE THEIR CHEMICAL SOAK INTO SOILING CONTAMINATE GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER. DELEGATE IN ALREADY STRAINED ECOSYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED WHEN EXPOSED TO BATTERY CHEMICALS WHEN WE TOOK. OUR FAUCETS WE COULD BE INGESTING DANGEROUS BILLS LITHIUM ION BATTERIES THE KIND MOST COMMONLY FOUND IN RECHARGE ELECTRONIC DEVICES. CAN BE VERY UNSTABLE WHEN DAMAGE TO CHRIST AND WHEN IT PROPERLY DISPOSED OF POST SERIOUS FIRE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS. WHEN LITHIUM ION BATTERIES BURNED THEY RELEASE FLUORIDE GAS WHICH POSES SERIOUS TOXIC THREATS TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS. FIREFIGHTERS IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. THE VERY PRICE COMPONENTS A BURN BATTERIES ALSO GETTRAPPED IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND POLLUTE LAKES AND STREAMS IN THE FORM OF ACID RAIN. AS AB TWO GLOBAL WARMING. OVER PAST THE MASS IN OF PROBABLY JUST. OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES INTO CALPERS WAY STREAM HAS RESULTED IN AN ALARMING NUMBER OF FIRES IN OUR MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES WASTE COLLECTION TRUCKS. IN OUR LANDFILLS GOD BLESS YOU. ACCORDING TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL SURVEY. TWENTY OF THE TWENTY SIX MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES SURVEYED HAD EXPERIENCED EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE FOR. DURING THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS OF WHICH 65% OR ALMOST TWO THIRDS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO IMPROPERLY RECYCLED BATTERIES. BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION INCREASE CONSUMPTION AND A LACK OF CONVENE DISPOSAL OPTIONS HIGHER LEVELS OF TOXIC BATTERIES AND PRODUCTS ARE CONTINUALLY ENTERING CALIFORNIA'S WAY STREAM. WITHOUT DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES ENTERING CALIFORNIA'S WAY STREAM CALIFORNIA WILL SUFFER EDITION FIRES THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE WASTE OPERATIONS AND HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. UNDER ITS PROVISIONS SB TWELVE FIFTEEN WILL CREATE ACCORDING TO SYSTEM OF FREE AND CONVENIENT COLLECTION BINS FOR EXPANDED LOSING PRODUCT IN BETTER BATTERIES AT RETAIL LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. TO ALLOW CONSUMERS REPLACE BATTERIES INTO THE BINS FOR PROPER DISPOSAL READ RATHER THAN DISCARDING THEM ALONG WITH THE REST OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD TRASH. THIS APPROACH TO POLICY GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY WHICH SB TWELVE FIFTEEN WILL APPLY TO CONSUMER BATTERIES HAS FIRM ROUTE ROUTES AND KEPT. HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE RECYCLING OF AN ARRAY OF HARD TO RECYCLE GOODS FROM MATTRESSES TO AUTOMOBILE TIRES. TO NOT COINCIDENTALLY CAR BATTERIES AS WELL. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED BY NEARLY UNANIMOUS VOTE SB TWO TWELVE AUTHORED BY OUR COLLEAGUE FORMER SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON WHICH REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO TAKE. UNUSED AND WASTED NEEDLES AND DISCARDED DRUGS SB TWELVE FIFTEEN REPLICATES THIS MODEL FOR CYCLE BEFORE RE CHARGEABLE BATTERIES AND LOOSE BATTERIES AND CONTINUES THIS VERY POSITIVE TREND. AS YOU MAY BE AWARE THIS POLICY HAS BEEN TRIED A HANDFUL OF TIMES IN PRESENTED TO THIS COMMITTEE TWICE BEFORE. I AM HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THIS YEAR WE'VE BEEN PRODUCTIVELY ENGAGING IN NEGOTIATING WITH THIS MANY AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE AND FOR THAT REASON YOU'LL KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR FRIENDS. WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED HAVE SINCE INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH. WHICH I AM VERY. BY ENROLLING FOR. AS A MORE EFFECT. THE S. OF A MORE AFFECT AND SYSTEM FOR CONSUMER BY WE CAN PREVENT FIRES ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS FROM OCCURRING THEREBY SAVING ON THE COST OF HIGHER GARBAGE RATES WILL ALSO PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC REDUCING THE RISK TO WASTE FOR CITY WORKERS AND BETTER SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA'S LAND WATER AND AIR SB TWELVE FIFTEEN WILL ALSO CREATE A CONSUMER OUR REGION EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. TO EDUCATE CALIFORNIANS AND ENCOURAGES THE PROPER DISPOSAL OF ALL BATTERIES THE BILL'S SPONSORS AND  LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE CURRENT THEIR CONCERNS AND COMMITTED TO SEX SUCCESSFULLY SECURING SUPPORT OR NEUTRALITY AMONG ALL PARTIES WERE LEAVING THE OVERALL INTENT OF THE BILL INTACT. I'M GRATEFUL THE CENTER WHAT COUNTS YOU FOR BEING A CO AUTHOR AND I RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY WITH ME IN PERSON TO TESTIFY TODAY ARE KAYLA ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE AND JASO SCHMELZER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP. COUNCIL OKAY IN HI GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KILL ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY BASED IN SAN MATEO COUNTY THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND RESIDENCES ELEVEN THOUSAND BUSINESSES AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS OF A LITHIUM ION BATTERY INDUCED FIRE AT A RECYCLING CENTER IT COMPLETELY DEVASTATED OUR FACILITY SHUTTING US DOWN FOR NINETY DAYS AND CAUSING EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY A YEAR TO FULLY RIGHT. THANK PRIOR WE HAD ONE INSURANCE PROVIDER NOW WE NEED SEVEN TO FIND THE SAME KIND OF COVERAGE INSURANCE WRITERS ARE FINDING IT TOO RISKY TO COVER FACILITIES LIKE OURS AFTER THE EXCESSIVE DAMAGES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PREVENTATIVE MEASURES TO REMOVE BATTERIES FROM OUR WAY STREAM BUT LAST YEAR ALONE WE SUFFERED TWELVE FIRES BETWEEN OUR MATERIAL COVERING FACILITY AND TRANSFER STATION TEN OF THEM COULD BE ATTRIBUTED. BATTERIES IS FIGHTERS COULD GROW TO A FIRE LIKE THE ONE IN TWENTY. ANOTHER MAJOR FIRE COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE OUR INSURANCE COMPLETELY. THESE BATTERIES THREATEN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PUBLICLY FUNDED WASTE COLLECTION AND RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND THESE FIRES POSE A SAFETY HAZARD TO OUR WORKERS. THIS ISSUE IMPACTS MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES AND WASTE COLLECTION VEHICLES AND EACH ONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS THIS IS A CRISIS THAT NEEDS A SOLUTION NOW AS WITH THE MINE BATTERIES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMON EVERYDAY PRODUCTS. SB TWELVE FIFTEEN IS CRITICAL TO DIVERT FROM BATTERY PRODUCTS IN THE WASTE STREAM TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR ENVIRONMENT- EFFECTS RESPECTIVELY- TONIGHT OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BRUCE JASON SMELTER HERE- TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS YOU'RE TO COUNSEL ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. I WANNA BE CLEAR AT THE OUTSET THAT THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT DEMONIZING ANY PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR TYPE OF PRODUCT I HAVE NO FEWER THAN THREE BATTERY AND BETTER PRODUCTS ON MY PERSON. AT THIS MOMENT OTHER GREAT- THEY MAKE ALL OF OUR LIVES BETTER- WHAT SB TWELVE FIFTEEN IS ABOUT IT. I THINK THAT THESE PRODUCTS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL IMPACTS ON THE SAFETY AND RESILIENCY. OF OUR SOLID WASTE REJECT ANY MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER- THEY- REALLY- THEY HAVE A- AND RIGHT NOW. I GOT HOME AFTER A STRAY. DAY I PLAYED THIS GAME WITH MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD- BUT WASN'T YOUR SOCIAL BAY PARTLY CAUSED BY THE BATTERY. THIS MEANS ANY POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND- BUT IT'S JUST A WRECK THAT THESE PER HAVE- IMPACTS ON OUR SOLID WASTE RECYCLING SYSTEM IN THE PRODUCERS SHOULD SHARE IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MITIGATING THOSE IMPACTS ALL THE BILL'S ABOUT- SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE BILL ITSELF PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE BILL HAD THESE BATTERIES AND BATTERY AND BETTER PRODUCTS IN THE SAME EPR PROGRAM THT SEEMED TO CAUSE SOME ANGST AMONGST THE VARIOUS PRODUCERS. THIS VERSION OF THE BILL SPLIT THEM INTO TWO WHICH IS PRETTY USEFUL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS AND COMPLIANCE STANDARDS FOR EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY THAT WORKS BETTER FOR THOSE PRODUCT CATEGORIES THAT'S PRETTY USEFUL I THINK THE- THE PRODUCT OF THAT CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION GOING- THIS YEAR SO AS THE SENATE POINTED OUT AT THIS PRETTY CLOSE TO EACH. WITH THE PRIOR PASSED- MEDS IN SHARPSVILLE AFTER A FEW YEARS AGO THAT DOES A FEW THINGS THAT WERE FIRST PRODUCE. FUND IN THE RECITE PROGRAM THE PRODUCTS I CONTAINS A VERY. UP APPROVAL- WITH DEPARTMENT I JUST DOUBLES HIS CLEAR. FOR THE COLLECTION NETWORK AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT PRODUCTS ONCE THEY'RE COLLECTED. CREATES AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE SO STAKEHOLDERS CAN BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE PLAN AND COMMENTING ON HOW IT'S WORKING. IT'S NOT LOCATION ON SOME RETAILERS. EIGHT AND TAKE BACK PROGRAMS AND IT HAS STRONG OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT ARE PRETTY TRIED AND TRUE- AT THIS POINT SO I WANT TO THANK THE DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE WORKING CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH US OUT ON THE BILL. SOME OF WHOM WERE PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE THIS YEAR- BUT I THERE ARE SOME DETAILS LEFT TO WORK OUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT OUR PROCESS IS GOING TO GET US THERE. WE'VE GOT GREAT LEADERSHIP- SO BUT I RESPECTFULLY URGE DRIVERS TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO TO FOLKS WANT TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL HERE IN PERSON. HI JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC A GUN AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THIS TIME FOR ALL THE REASONS ARTICULATED BY KAYLA AND JASON. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DIRECT OFTEN HAPPILY CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU. MICHAEL BATH WITH REPUBLIC SERVICES IN SUPPORT. READ ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF C. R. AND R. WE'VE ACTUALLY LOST VEHICLES TO THIS- IN STRONG SUPPORT YEAH. INTERESTING THE- PERILS OF SOME OF THE PLASTICS WORK WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF THE FOLKS WHO LINE UP- OKAY APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT TESTIMONY OF ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES YOU WANT TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR ITS SENTIMENTS BILL. HM IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO. SB TWELVE FIFTEEN WE HAVE LINE. SIXTY HI GOOD MORNING CARE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAKE LOTS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSOR AND WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR- FOR CONVENING STAKEHOLDERS RELATED DANCING THE ISSUE THIS YEAR. AND THAT LINE FIFTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE MORNING CARE MEMBERS REFLECTED OFF ON BEHALF OF THE FOLLOWING CLIENTS BUT FROM PASSED THE WASTE MANAGEMENT FORTY ALAMEDA SUBWAY AND NATIONAL ACTION IN STRONG SUPPORT. AND LINE SIX THE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS THAT IS SCHERING GREEN WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN ADDITION DISTRICT HERE IN SUPPORT. AND I HAVE NO ONE ELSE CAN KILL. OKAY THE LET'S GO TO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IF THERE IS ANY ANYONE HERE IN PERSON WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT CONCERNS YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CAROLINE MY NAME IS WALTER ALCORN AND THAT THE CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND WE REPRESENT MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS OF CONSUMER ELECTRONICS- WE'RE VERY- VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAME THINGS I THINK THE BILL'S SPONSOR AND THE ADVOCATES. ARE ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE PRE FIRES- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THE BILL IS DRAFTED CURRENTLY- AND I'M SPECIFICALLY GONNA DRESS BATTERY EMBEDDED PRODUCTS. IN THE WAY THAT- THE BILL IS STRUCTURED- WE THINK THE COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT- GIVEN THE- THE BROAD VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE EMBEDDED BATTERIES. IN THAT THROUGH A PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY ORGANISATION WOULD BE- REALLY AN UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE- I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE EPR SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES ON E. WASTE- OUR RECOMMENDATION IS IF THERE DOES NEED TO BE. EXTENDED THEIR WORK EXPANDED COLLECTION AND RECYCLING OF THESE BATTERY INVENTED PRODUCTS THE BILL IN THE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE BASICALLY THE CURRENT COVERED ELECTRONIC WASTE PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE BATTERY EMBEDDED PRODUCTS- WE'VE BEEN HAVING GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH- THE BILL'S SPONSORS OFFICE AND SOME OF THE ADVOCATES. ON THIS ISSUE WE WAY TO COME TO RESOLUTION ON IT- BUT OUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO USE THAT IS THE STARTING POINT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS TODAY. THANK YOU- LOVE DELAY GET TEN SAID RESPOND SOME OF THAT IN THE SECOND I ANYONE ELSE WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS WITH A BILL YOUR PERSON. YEAH COME ON UP. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT FIELDING GROUPS ABOUT COME CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS- IN A CLEAR POSITION TODAY WE HAVE SOME REMAINING TECHNICAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE DEFINITION SO WE- APPRECIATE THE- AMENDMENTS FOR CLASS TWO AND CLASS THREE MEDICAL DEVICES BUT HAVE REMAINING TECHNICAL CONCERNS. ABOUT THAT THE SCOPE. OF THE CLASS ONE MEDICAL DEVICES ARE WORKING PRODUCTIVELY WITH AUTHORED SPONSORS AND APPRECIATE THAT COLLABORATIVE WORK SO FAR. HOPE TO HAVE RESOLUTION BY SESSIONS IN BUT- SO FAR SO GOOD AND- THANK YOU THE AUTHOR I IN SPOTS FOR WORKING WITH US THANK YOU. THANK THE TERM MEMBERS JOHN LINGER ON BEHALF OF THE ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ADVAMED WERE THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR MEDICAL DEVICES IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF BYGONES LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS. THANK YOU. FOR DINNER FEEL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE OPPOSED FOR THE REASONS PEOPLE YOU SEE MENTIONED AS WELL AS IN OUR LETTER. SHE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSORS. THANK YOU. WEITERE COMMITTEE ADAM RIGHT WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO REGISTERING A TWEENER POSITION I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH US WE THINK WE CAN GET THERE ON THIS ONE BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE RETAIL- ISSUES THAT- RETAILERS HAVE EXPRESSED IN THE LETTER- BUT OTHERWISE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THE OTHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY OUR FOLKS ON ON ON THE PHONE LINES LIKE TO VOICE OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS ABOUT SB TWELVE FIFTEEN. IF YOU WISH FIFTY REGARDING AT EIGHT TWELVE FIFTEEN. PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AND ONE MOMENT WHILE I GET MY NUMBERS. BY TWENTY TO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JACOB KATHY WITH THE POSITION OF HOME APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS AND- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE AFOREMENTIONED REASONS. AND I HAVE NO ONE ELSE CAN Q. CRIME. OUR LISTING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMUNITY FOR QUESTIONS AND THOUGHTS- WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ASKED THE SENATOR THE AUTHOR TO DO JUST GIVE. US HIS PERSPECTIVE ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION IN YOUR SENSE OF THE- CONVERSATIONS. YOUR PREFERRED THAT SUIT SO DON'T THANK YOU FIRST. OF ALL THE ADVOCATES AND I THINK THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR A YEAR IT'S PROBABLY WORTH NOTINGTHERE'S A PARALLEL BILL MOVING THROUGH THE THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY THAT AUTHORED BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN- BUT YOU KNOW IN WITH GRATEFUL FOR THE YOU KNOW THE VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS BUT YET TO START- ON ON THE BATTERY EMBEDDED PRODUCTS SIDE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S AN INHERENTLY. CHALLENGING ISSUE- IN AND PART OF IT COMES DOWN TO PRODUCT DESIGN. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT AMONG. THE PARTIES THAT WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT BETTER WAYS. TO MAKE SURE THESE BACK ON THEIR WAY TO THE PROPER DISPOSAL. SCENARIOS A AND SO WE YOU KNOW WE ARE DELIVERY AGNOSTIC WHEN IT COMES TO. A BUNCH OF ISSUES HERE WITH BUT DO YOU KNOW THE BROADER CONCERN REMAINS THAT- IT BETWEEN THE ROD BATTERY THAT'D PRODUCTS RIGHT SO AS LITHIUM ION BATTERY SHOULD BECOME AT RISK OF BECOME. MORE COMMON THEY DISPLACED. YOUR YOU KNOW THE COULD LOSE BATTERIES THAT WE ALL GREW UP USED TO- THEY'VE THEY'RE THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY'RE DESIGNED INTO PRODUCTS THEY'RE OFTEN HARD TO TAKE IT OUT- DURING THE DISPOSAL PROCESS- ANSWER. THE EPR MODEL SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY ADDRESSES AT A SYSTEMIC LEVEL- IN THE WAY THAT WE'VE DONE AS A SPOKE TO MENTION FOR OTHER PRODUCTS. AND SYLLABLES ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVING- BOTH A CLEAR INTEREST BUT ALSO A CLEAR A CERTAIN ROLE WITHIN THAT PROCESS SO YOU KNOW. HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. I APPRECIATE. SENATE AFFECT BY. I'M ON THE MEDICAL DEVICES SIMILAR RIGHT THERE A CLASS OF MEDICAL BY WITH THE- BUT THERE'S SOME TWEETERS STUFF RIDES AND SOME THINGS THAT- YOU KNOW TRICIA THE CLASS ONE LEVEL THAT WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW SHOULD PROBABLY BE MANAGED IN SOME WAY THEN- IT'S CLEAR AS TO HOW WE HOW WE COLLECTIVELY BUT ALSO THE MANUFACTURES WOULD- SERVED PARTICIPATE MAKE SURE THAT THEIR BATTERIES ARE ACCESSIBLE BUT THEN YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM IS FROM AND- MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A WAY IN A PLACE TO DISPOSE OF THEM- YOU KNOW GLAD TO TAKE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I THINK THE EMPHASIS HERE IS- THIS IS BEEN A VERY. COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THROUGHOUT- WE'VE LEARNED FROM LAST YEAR I THINK IS ONE OF THE WINDOWS VENTION I THOUGHT WE MADE A DISTINCTION THIS YEAR BETWEEN LOOSE AND A BETTER BATTERIES AND WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW CARILLO SIR PROCESSES FOR BOTH BOTH ARE SUBJECT TO AMENDMENT YOU KNOW IN WAYS THAT INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY WITH THE END GOAL OF GETTING SOMETHING THAT WORKS. YEP OKAY. ALL RIGHT I'M- OKAY I GET THE OTHER CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IS A GOOD PLACE TO START WOULD BE THE EXISTING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW- AND HELD THAT. YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO YOU ENVISION BECAUSE ALL EVERY EPA PROGRAM SEARCH WHAT'S ON THE GROUND WHAT WE DO IN RIGHT NOW AND THEN EVOLVES INTO- ANOTHER COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL PROCESS BUT YOU STILL. YES HIGHLIGHT THE BEST PRACTICES IF THERE ARE SOME BEST PRACTICE AND WE COLLECT BATTERIES HERE RIGHT ON THE- YEAH YOU KNOW THEY'RE- CERTAINLY THERE ARE BEST PRACTICES FOR BATTERIES ABOVE A CERTAIN SIZE- BUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING. ACROSS THE WASTE STREAM IS CLEARLY YOU KNOW THE- YOU KNOW THE SUPPLY OF BATTERIES COMING INTO THE WASTE STREAM IMPROBABLY SUPPOSED THIS IS OVERWHELMING BILITY. TO HANDLE THEM A. N. O. N. AT REAL RISK- TIMMER STRIDES WE INTEND TO TRUST THAT TO TRANSPORT TRASH SO IS THIS IS REAL RIGHT YOU KNOW THE OF THESE FIRES A REALISTIC YOU HURT SOMEONE WHO INSISTS- A FIRE AT A DISPOSAL FACILITY IS BOTH DANGEROUS BUT IT CAN WHAT IT CAN RESULT IN SHUTTING DOWN THAT FACILITY. PRECIPITATION AT A TIME YOU CAN RESULT IN THAT FACILITY LOSING ITS INSURANCE- AND HAS AND HE HAS A BIG SORT OF THE COULD KENNEDY EFFECT THROUGHOUT THE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE SYSTEM. AND SO IT YOU KNOW DO GLAD TO BUILD ON ANYTHING THAT WORKS BUT I THINK THE OBSERVATION IS. AS IT RELATES TO BATTERIES IS THERE'S NEED HERE THE NEEDS DRESS IN THE ONLY. SERVE LOGICAL APPROACH IS AN EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY MODEL. I MEAN I THINK THE U. YOU GIVE. THE PRODUCERS THE LEAD RESPONSIBLE BUT YOU STILL HAVE. YOU STILL GOT IT SOME STUFF IS EVEN MORE WITH. THE PR THERE STILL COULD BE SOME THINGS THAT THE CONSUMER THROWS INTO. THE WE STREAM SO PART OF THAT IS EDUCATING THE CONSUMER. MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE FOR THAT IN AND WORKING WITH OUR- THE MERCENARY BECAUSE OF THE REMAINDER THAT COULD SEND. THAT NOW IS PART OF THE PRODUCERS RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL WITH THAT NOT. WASTE MANAGEMENT OR REPUBLICAN THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME COORDINATION WITH THOSE GUYS TO WHICH HOPEFULLY IT SHRINKS BUT THEN. BUT THEN WE FIGURE OUT THE BEST PRACTICES ON HOW TO. REMOVE THE REMOVE THAT STUFF WHEN THERE'S LESS OF IT I GUESS TO TOTALLY AGREE AND I THINK PART OF THE- CERTIFICATION COMPONENT- BUT PART OF IT IS BINDING PRODUCERS TO. YOU KNOW TO THE BROADER PROCESS OF EDUCATING USERS TO HELP. HER PROBABLY RECYCLE THESE BATTERIES BILLS A MOVE BY CASKEY- THE QUESTIONS THOUGHTS FROM THE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY ME CLOSE YEAH I JUST WITH THAT AGAIN YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANKS TO ALL THE PARTICIPANTS THIS BAR- AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MICHAEL. GRAHAM CONTEMPLATES CALL THE ROLL I REMEMBER NINE SB THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMENDED REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALAN HI ALAN I BATES. DOLLY GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I SKINNER STERN. MAKOWSKI HIGH. OKAY SO LEAVE THE ROTH AND FOR- FOR FOLKS TO ANNA THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR OKAY- WE'VE GOT TO COME TO EUROPE HERE TO PRESENT. SB ELEVEN A ONE THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOUR IN YOUR AGENDA PACKETS MEMBERS. YEP YOU MAY PROCEED CENTER GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ELEVEN A ONE. WHICH SEEKS TO FURTHER CALIFORNIA'S POLICY GOALS TO REACH ECONOMY WIDE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE BY SUPPORTING CARBON CAPTURE SEQUESTRATION AND UTILIZATION PROJECTS. WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL- AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE CHAIR I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND NET NEGATIVE EMISSIONS THEREAFTER WILL REQUIRE A MULTITUDE OF CLIMATE CHANGE INITIATIVES ONE THAT IS VITAL TO OUR STATE SUCCESS IS CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION. AND SEQUESTRATION OR C. C. U. S. THIS IS A SENTIMENT SHARED WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AMBITIOUS DOMESTIC CLIMATE GOAL OF NET ZERO EMISSIONS ECONOMY WIDE BY TWENTY FIFTY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS THE NEED TO CAPTURE. TRANSPORT AND PERMANENTLY SEQUESTER SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF CARBON DIOXIDE. THERE IS ROOM A REAL TIME BENEFIT. THAT C. C. U. S. PROVIDES ENVIRONMENTALLY THE PROCESS CAPTURES CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS STRAIGHT FROM THE SOURCE TO AVOID RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. IN FACT CARBON CAPTURE METHODS SEQUESTER MORE THAN 90% OF CO TWO EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES 90% OF WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE RELEASED. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ROLE IN A PRACTICAL METHOD. ESTIMATES ALSO INDICATE APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE STATE'S TOTAL CO TWO EMISSIONS CAN BE CAPTURED AND STORED WITH C. C. U. S. C. C. U. S. HAS BENEFITS ENVIRONMENTALLY BUT ALSO FOR OUR WORKFORCE AND OVERALL ECONOMY. THE USE OF C. C. U. S. COULD ENABLE DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE INDUSTRIES TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS THE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WHILE DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THEIR GHG EMISSIONS. C. C. U. S. ACTIVITIES WOULD ALSO PROVIDE JOBS FOR CALIFORNIA WITH BURKE CALIFORNIANS WITH SKILL SETS THAT MAY BECOME OBSOLETE IN THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSIT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG IS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS THIS TRANSITION. AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO- A GREENER ECONOMY AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE WORK% FORCE. ON THE BALLOT WOULD BE- AFFECTED BY THAT. AND PARTICULARLY IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT THAT HAPPENED HOW'S THAT WORK FORCE. ALSO CONSIDER THAT MANY ORGANIZATION AND COMMERCIALIZE SECTORS ARE READILY ABLE TO APPLY C. C. U. S. TECHNOLOGIES TO THEIR OPERATIONS WHAT IS NEEDED IS STATE SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. SB TEN OH ONE PURSUES THIS GOAL BY ESTABLISHING CARBON CAPTURE YOU ASIAN SEQUESTRATION PROGRAM. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. I MERRY OBJECTIVE OF WHICH IS TO ASSIST IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF PROJECTS THAT WILL ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT. DEPLOYMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ADVANCED NEW TECHNOLOGIES THE CAPTURE AND SEQUESTER CARBON DIOXIDE ADMISSION EMISSIONS IN INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL FACILITIES. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS ALREADY RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF C. C. U. S. THE HELP THE STATE MEET ITS GOALS RELATED TO GHG REDUCTIONS BY INCLUDING IT IN ITS SCOPING PLAN. AS AN IMPORTANT CLIMATE CHANGE SOLUTION. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF UNDERGROUND POOR SPACE FOR CARBON STORAGE TO BE SEQUESTERED. IN MOST STATES OWNERSHIP OF SUBSURFACE PORE SPACE PER PROPERTY RIGHTS GENERALLY BELONG TO THE OWNER AND OFFICE. RIGHT BOB HOWEVER CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY LACKS A CLEAR AND DEFINED LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR POOR SPACE OWNERSHIP FOR CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION. CLARIFICATION OF POOR SPACE OWNERSHIP WILL ALLOW CARBON CAPTURE PROJECTS TO QUALIFY UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF CALIFORNIA'S LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD SO COMPANIES CAN APPLY THE- URBAN TARGETS THAT BY CARPENTER THE STANDARD. AND ALIGNING ONE STEP WITH THE FEDERAL CSU. WHEN IT WILL ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA IS WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN AN EFFICIENT AND LOGICAL FASHION. CALIFORNIA COULD BECOME A GLOBAL LEADER IN C. C. U. S. DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT TO ACHIEVE ITS CLIMATE GOALS AS IT HAS IN OTHER CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES BUT TO DO SO IT NEEDS TO ACT. AND TO ACT COMPREHENSIVELY BY SUPPORTING MEASURES THAT ENDEAVOR TO UTILIZE C. C. AT C. C. U. S. TO THE STATE'S BENEFIT WE CAN CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WHILE WE WORK TO ATTAIN OUR CLIMATE. OUR STATES CLIMATE CHANGE CALLS ON ONE OF THE THINGS AB AND WHEN ONE OF THE DIFFICULT THINGS ABOUT BEING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW IS THAT- WE'VE HAD A WORKING GROUP THAT IS LOOKING AT CLIMATE CHANGE AND- ONE OF THE ISSUES WE'VE- BEEN WAITING TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. IS EXACTLY THE PARAMETERS THAT WE BE USING UP FOR C. C. U. S. THE BILL REACH THIS COMMITTEE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE NEGOTIATIONS I EXPECT THAT- ONCE WE CONCLUDE WITH ALL OF THAT WHICH SHOULD BE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- THE BILL MAY CHANGE AND I SAY THAT HESITANTLY BECAUSE- WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YET. AND IT IS- LEADERSHIP THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS PUT TOGETHER BY LEADERSHIP AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY DILIGENTLY ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT- ANY. OF MY CAR. IS THAT- I WANT TO SHARE THIS COMMITTEE THAT NUMBER ONE I'M NOT INTERESTED IN EXPANDING THIS T. O. R. WHICH IS THE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY- BUT BUT THERE ARE NEGOTIATIONS NOT BEEN IN THE OCEANS GOING ON AND YOU DON'T GIVE UP SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN THAT IS PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT- THAT YEAH IS A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT ARE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION SO I IT JUST I RAISE THAT ISSUE- I MISTER CARE YOU ASK ME IN A IN A CONVERSATION IN REGARDS TO- THIS BILL- ABOUT THE FEDERAL FUNDING PROGRAM WHICH IS TAX. CREDIT PROGRAM WHICH IS THE FORTY FIVE Q. MY UNDERSTANDING I HAD STAFF GO BACK IN AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FUNDING IS THAT THE CURRENT BILL THAT PASSES THAT PASSED DOES NOT ALLOW- EOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY UNDER THE FORTY FIVE Q. PROGRAM THE ONE THAT IS PROPOSED THAT IS IN NEGOTIATION DOES- AT A LOWER RATE BUT BUT- I WISH TRYING TO ALIGN THE ARE BUILT WITH THE FEDERAL- PROGRAM SO THAT- FOR EFFICIENCY AND BECAUSE IT MAKES GOOD SENSE- IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOOD THEY'RE MOVING ON THIS AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE FOR. ISSUING FINES AND IN IN THE M. TAX CREDIT ARENA THEN WE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WORKS AND- AND TRY TO ALIGN OURS VERY SIMILAR TO A CELL IT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I GOT BACK TO YOU ON THAT YEAH I'M HERE I AM HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY REMOTELY IS DR SARAH SALTER MANAGING DIRECTOR AT THE STANFORD CENTER FOR CARBON STORAGE AND IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM IS CHRIS HANNON WITH THE LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCTION. CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. SURE OKAY MODERATED YOU WANTED START WITH- SIR SALTER. OKAY SIR AUTHOR I AM ASSUMING YOU CAN HEAR ME YES WE CAN YOU. OKAY GREAT OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE TODAY. UNIVERSITY AN ENERGY FUTURES INITIATIVE RECENTLY COMPLETED A STUDY ON PCS OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE YOU FIND THINGS AND THEN ADDRESS HAS SENATE BILL ELEVEN A ONE CAN HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY CHALLENGES IF YOU SEE US IN THE STATE. L. AND ELECTRICITY SECTOR CALIFORNIA. I MET MOST FORTY FOR. OF CALIFORNIA ANNUAL EMISSIONS. IN OUR STUDY WE IDENTIFIED SEVENTY SIX LARGE EMITTERS THAT ARE IDEAL CANDIDATES FOR CAP CARBON CAPTURE RETROFIT. AND COULD ADDRESS 15% OF THE STATE THE MISSIONS. OF COURSE CAPTURE HERE TO BE GOOD IF YOU WITH THAT. ARE AT THE OFFICE AT THE STORAGE OPPORTUNITY AND CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST GEOLOGIC STORAGE TENSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE CAPACITY TO STORE OVER SEVENTY GIGATONS. OF CO TWO. I NOTICED THAT I SWITCHED FROM MEGATONS. TO KICK IT TURNS. OUR THE OPPORTUNITY THIS YES THE STATE OF PA. ISSUE BUT START THE CHALLENGE. AND HOW FIFTY S. PROJECT INJECT CO TWO WELL INTO THE FORTY EIGHT DEEP BELOW THE SURFACE. A AT THREE THOUSAND FEET OR MORE. IMPORTANT PHASE HER FIRST TO THE VOICE IN THE BY THAT NOT FAR BY SOLID MATTER IN WHICH BE USED FIRST CAR ABOUT. NOW AN UNDERGROUND PLUMAS TWO SYSTEM ACTED SPREAD OVER A WIDE AREA AFFECTING MANY POTENTIAL TO RIGHTS HOLDERS. AND IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CARBON- GEOLOGIC SEQUESTRATION IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S NEED FOR A CREEK CLEAR RESOLUTION INTO THE PROPERTY LOSS ISSUES. IDEALLY ALLOWING OPERATORS TO ESTABLISH THE NEEDED RIGHTS AT MINIMUM FINANCIAL AND TRANSACTIONAL COST. IN ADDITION CARBS CCS PROTOCOL REQUIRES OF THE PROJECT OPERATOR MUST SHOW PROOF OF EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE THE SPORT PORTS BASED IN THE STORAGE DOWN. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN LC-MS CREDIT WHICH AS WE KNOW ARE CRITICAL TO THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF MOST PCS PROJECTS. THIS LACK OF LEGAL CARE CLARITY ON GEOLOGIC PORK BASED OWNERSHIP CREATES REALLY A WHOLE PACKET OF LEGAL ISSUES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF CO TWO STORAGE PROJECTS. APPLE THIS LACK OF CLEAR OF COURSE BASED ON A COMP PLUME STAY MIGRATES ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE RESERVOIR FORCING THE PROJECT DEVELOPER TO SEEK ADDITIONAL AND UNNECESSARY CENTER IF YOU COULD IF YOU COULD JUST WRAP UP YOUR COMMENTS. YES OKAY- ARE SENATE BILL WHAT ELEVEN A ONE WOULD PROVIDE GREATER PREDICTABILITY PRETTY FAST OPERATORS. AND ALLEVIATE A MAJOR ROADBLOCK TO INVESTMENT IN CCS PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO CHRIS HANNAN WHO I BELIEVE HERE. GOOD MOVE GOOD MORNING HONORABLE- COMMITTEE CHAIR HONORABLE SENATORS MY NAME IS CHRIS HANNAN- THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY'S BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL- THIS MORNING I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL- STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL REPRESENTS. APPROXIMATE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THE BEST TRAINED MEN AND WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION. ANYWHERE PROXY SEVENTY THOUSAND OF THOSE MEMBERS ARE PRACTICES THAT ARE LEARNING THEIR CRAFTS- MANY. BEING GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES- FROM- PRESSURE BRADY IS PROGRAMS LIKE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION GIVING A SECOND CHANCE. TO PEOPLE AND- MANY MANY CHANCES AS WELL TO VETERANS ARE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL REPRESENTS NEARLY A THIRD OF ALL UNION CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS- SOLUTION FORWARD MEET THE CLIMATE GOALS SET BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE TWENTY THIRTY. REDUCTION LEVELS THAT NEED TO BE MATTER IN LESS THAN EIGHT YEARS WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO LOWER EMISSIONS CARBON CAPTURE CAN NOT ONLY. REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES FROM EXISTING FACILITIES NEW FACILITIES AS WELL AS REVERSE SOME OF THE ALREADY POLLUTANTS THAT ARE IN THERE TODAY. WITHOUT LOCAL MANUFACTURING LOCAL ENERGY AND LOCAL SOURCES FOR CALIFORNIA. WORKING FAMILIES ARE IMPACTED- UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED THE POLLUTION YES IMPACTS ALSO THE LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY THE LOSS OF JOBS RECENTLY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AT THE ACL US SOLAR PROJECT. FIVE HUNDRED BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES MEMBERS INCLUDING NEARLY THREE HUNDRED IBEW ELECTRICIANS WORKING ON A FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATT. PROJECT THAT INCLUDED BATTERY STORAGE WERE LAID OFF JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING AND THROUGH CHRISTMAS TIME THEY WERE LAID OFF BECAUSE IMPORTED MATERIAL WAS BACKED UP IN THE PORT OF LONG BEACH AND IT COULD GET THROUGH WITHOUT LOCAL MANUFACTURING FOR STEEL CONCRETE. ENERGY MANY OF US ARE FACING AN UPHILL BATTLE I THAT WE CAN'T ACHIEVE OUR STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS WERE ALL HANDS ON DECK TO WORK WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. MEET AND SURPASS OUR GOALS BUT WE NEED ALL OPTIONS AND CARBON CAPTURE IS A NECESSARY AND THOUGHTFUL WAY OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE- IMPACTS OKAY THANK YOU BETWEEN SAN. IS IT ALRIGHT OF FOLKS WANT TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL WANT TO COME UP TO THEM I CAN JUST. WITH YOUR SUPPORT.

NORTH ROMERO OF CALIFORNIAN BERMAN PROVIDERS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. AND WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE. ALL RIGHT- AND- FEDERAL CASKEY. SO I APPLAUD THE DESIRABILITY TO GET GREATER PREDICTABILITY HERE AND I'M NOT CORRECT. COMMENT ON THE BORDER OWNERSHIP BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO NATURAL RESOURCES IN A WHILE AS I UNDERSTAND. THERE'S THREE BILLS I HAVE A BILL MISTER HAS BILL YOU HAVE BILL THE SKINNER HAS THREE CEMENT PLANTS I HAVE THREE PUNY LITTLE PLANTS AND THEN THE OTHER HUNDRED SEVENTY PLANTS WOULD COME UNDER AT LEAST THE GUIDELINES THAT WILL BE SPELLED OUT HERE SO THE IMPORTANCE OF- GETTING IT RIGHT. IS KEY. YOU'VE CHOSEN TO HOUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE C. C. U. S. PROGRAM WITH THE AIRPORT AND I SEE THE INITIAL DESIRABILITY BECAUSE MOST OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE TESTIFIED OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD SO. THAT'S WHERE THAT THAT PROGRAMS THAT HOUSE AND THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THEIR SCOPING PLAN AND- I AM FOREVER. HOPEFUL THAT SOMETHING GOOD COMES OUT THE SCOPING PLAN THIS TIME BUT WE KNOW THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION ACTUALLY DOES THE CITING OF THESE FACILITIES WE KNOW THE- STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD IS DEALING WITH. WATER- CONCERNS WE HAVE OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THESE THESE PLANTS- PENCE. AND SOME OPERATIONS ACTUALLY DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD BECAUSE OF BECAUSE THE USE. WHAT DO YOU YOU SAY ABOUT. COORD OKAY WITH THAT SAID. DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S A DOES OUR ABILITY OR AN IMPROVEMENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE IN COORDINATION WITH THESE OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE. RESTRICTION OVER OVER IT- YEAH OVER CITING BECAUSE PART OF THIS IS JUST CITING AND- AND- RESERVOIR- LOCATIONS AND THAT CALCIUM IS ANOTHER STATE AGENCY THAT THAT PLACE IN THIS ARENA. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THE OTHER AGENCY THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION IS THE STATE FARM FIRE MARSHAL BECAUSE THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR PIPES- AND- THE SAFETY OF A- OF CONDUCTING A- THE PRODUCT THROUGH PIPES- IT'S A SUBJECT OF A OF A LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF PUTTING IT THROUGH TO THE IN THE AIRBOAR IS BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE SCOPING ANALYSIS AND YOU HAVEN'T LCMS. BUT ALSO ONE OF THE UP- REQUIREMENTS IS THAT- IT LEAST AS WE AS I ENVISION IT IS THAT WE ACTUALLY THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO CCS THAT WE ALSO ENSURE THAT THE- PARTICULATE. OF BY PRODUCTS- ARE CAPTURED AND ARE REDUCED AS WELL IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE NOT GIVING UP ONE FOR THE OTHER AND THAT'S REALLY IN THE JURISDICTION OF THE AIRPORT AND SO IT'S THE REASON THAT WAS THE REASONING BEHIND PUTTING IT IN THE AIRPORT BUT BUT ULTIMATELY- I BELIEVE IT- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO. A- HAVE A PROCESS WHERE ALL THE PERMITTING HAPPENS IN IN TOGETHER- SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THAT THE AGENCIES WORK TOGETHER. YEAH I MEAN IF THE CHURCH IS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE DESIRE STATED GOALS IS TO DEVELOPING THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR AN ID I HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE AIRPORT BEING THE LEAD. ON THE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES YOU KNOW I MEAN I MIGHT BUILT USES THE ENERGY COMMISSION TODAY TO DO IT WITH THE CAN CONSULTATION FOR EXACTLY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PARTICULATES ARE REMOVED BUT THEY- LATER BUT THEY SAY OKAY. AFTER THE PROJECT IS THERE. TELL THE AIRPORT HOW IT REDUCES THE PARTICULATE MATTER SINCE IT DOESN'T IN THE AIRPORTS AS OKAY YOU HAVE TO DO THAT- IT'S A- HEY IT'S A GOOD FRAMEWORK I MEAN I'M GOING TO ALL ARE MOVED TO BILL HERE- IS I KNOW THAT THERE'S WORK THAT HAS AT HAS TO BE DONE. ON IT BUT I THINK THAT PREDICTABILITY AND ALSO THE MESSAGE THAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO HAVE SOME FORM OF C. C. U. S. RIGHT IN IN OUR PORTFOLIO WHATEVER WHATEVER THAT HOWEVER THAT GETS DEVELOPED IN I KNOW THAT THE NEXT COMMITTEE HAS A VERY BIG JOB ON THE BORDER OWNERSHIP AND HELP THAT- IS PLACE AND AGAIN THE PIPELINES IS A WHOLE OTHER. THE DEAL THAT WE'RE JUST NOT. IT'S YOU FOCUSED ON IT YOU'VE TOUCHED ON IT BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S NEEDS. SOME WORK SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS. YEAH I MISTER. FROM. THANKS URBAN THIRTY APPRECIATE YOUR OPENING REMARKS ESPECIALLY SENATOR JUSTIN IN TERMS OF THE NATURE OF THE WHOLE DISCUSSION AND YOU PUT YOUR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL AND PUT IN SOME REALLY SUBSTANTIVE FORD SO I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO I WANT TO DO THE TO DIG INTO THE PORE SPACE- DISCUSSION TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW JUST GETTING INTO THE NITTY GRITTY BECAUSE I'M HOPEFUL WE CAN O THAT THROUGH. NATURAL RESOURCES AND- JUST. HOW HOW TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORK RIGHT IN A MINERAL ESTATE AND THE LAND IS STATE AND CONTRACTS PRIOR TO THAT AND- SO. I WANT TO SET THAT ONE ASIDE FOR THE- FUTURE THE- THE QUESTIONS OR OR CONCERNS I HAVE I THINK WE'RE- REALLY WILL EXPLAIN THE HUMAN ANALYSIS I MEAN I. IT ON PAGE- WHAT IS IT ON PAGE FIVE VISITS- THE. YES EIGHT FIVE I DIDN'T HEAR AYE AYE MAYBE IT WAS A LISTENING CLOSELY BUT- THERE'S A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT NOT JUST THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GOALS BUT AROUND- EOR AND FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION I ASK THE SAME QUESTION AS SENATOR SKINNER WHEN HER BILL CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. SO THE CONCERN I'VE HAD I HAVEN'T YOU CAN. YOU DON'T YOU CAN DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO ADDRESS IT IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT THAT A QUESTION BUT- ESPECIALLYYOUR CONTACTS WE GET A LOT OF CARBON LOS. WHEN THE WHEN THE FIELDS ARE OPEN RIGHT THAT CAN HAPPEN. HOW DO WE CHAU CERTAINTY THAT THAT CARBON'S ACTUALLY STAYING THERE PERMANENTLY- SO LOOKING FOR PERMANENCE AND LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF BACKSTOP ON THAT PERMITS TO MAKE SURE THAT- FOLKS. STATEWIDE NOT NINE DOES NOT A LOCAL POLLUTION ISSUE BUT STATEWIDE ARE ASSURED THAT A TON IS REALLY A TON IN THE GROUND THERE. AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEY'VE LOOKED AT SOME SUGGESTIONS AROUND BACKSTOP OR SOME KIND OF PULLING YOUR BUFFER ACCOUNT SO THAT IF THERE'S A RELEASE. YOU'LL HAVE SOME KIND OF RECOURSE FROM THE OPERATOR SO THAT YOU'RE NOT SORT OF STUCK IN THE SAME WITH FORESTRY. PROJECTS WE'VE HAD TROUBLE WITH WHERE YOU KNOW YOU YOU BY A FEW MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE OFFICE AND IT BURNS UP AND THEN. WE'RE LEVEL IN THE BACK SO HOW TO SORT OF. BUILD THAT CARBON RECOURSE IF YOU WILL. INTO IT. SO THAT'S PERMITS ON THE MORE STATEWIDE LEVEL I THINK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE CONCERNS I HAVE A REALLY ABOUT. THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THESE WORK THROUGH THESE PROJECTS. THE GOALS IN THE BILL DON'T DON'T REALLY DELVE INTO- QUALITY AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE- AND I KNOW THAT THIS THE ANALYSIS. FLOATED ALREADY BUT IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW THESE ARE VERY ENERGY INTENSIVE PROJECTS CERTAINLY ON THE CAPTURE SIDE- AND IT CAN BE ON THE STORAGE SIDE AS WELL. AND WITH THAT ENERGY USE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GENERATE THAT POWER FROM SOMEWHERE SO THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT INTERIOR GOING TO HAVE. AIR QUALITY IMPACTS ON ALREADY BURDENED COMMUNITIES- AND I WANT TO BE. SURE THAT. I'M WE'RE NOT EXTENDING. WERE SUBSIDIZING IN ANY WAY- PROJECTS THAT YOU KNOW OR OTHERWISE DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMMUNITY SO- I AM CONCERNED IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SAY ENHANCING THE REVENUES OF AN OIL COMPANY. FOR THEIR ENHANCE STORE RECOVERY PROJECT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR IT FROM FORTY FIVE Q. ON THE ONE END. AND THEN FROM SB THIRTY TWO ON THE OTHER AND THEN THE COMMUNITY ITSELF WILL GET LEFT BEHIND AND SO THAT'S THE SORT OF ESSENCE OF MY CONCERN. BUT I JUST WANT TO. I KNOW THAT THESE ARE TOUGH POLITICS I KNOW THAT THESE THERE'S TOUGH POLICY HERE TO. I APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW. YOUR YOUR LABORING ON THIS AND- AND I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT- BUT BUT HAVING THOSE ASSURANCES AROUND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. AND THEN HAVE IT BE HAVING SOME CERTAINTY AROUND THE BROADER CARBON PERMANENCE I THINK FOR MANY Q. PERSPECTIVE OR MY MAIN ISSUES AT THIS POINT. THANKS FOR THE THANKS FOR TO THE COMMITTEE STEP BY THE WAY FOR THEIR DEEP DIVE ANY ANALYSIS IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE GOING FOR TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I TO WANNA I WANNA THANK YOU SENATOR I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN IN THIS GROUP FOR SOME TIME AND THIS. CAME UP- AND YOUR WORKING THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AND I KNOW YOU'RE COMMITTED. TO CONTINUING TO NEGOTIATE AND- I JUST HAVE TO GET CLEAR ON A FEW THINGS AND ASK A FEW QUESTIONS- BUT THE FIRST IS OF COURSE ON THE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE STILL NEGOTIATING THAT. IT NEARLY IN THIS BILL IS IT AND AS AND AS IT IS IN PRINT JUST THE PRIORITIZE IS AT THIS POINT. NOT IT STILL ALLOWS ESSENTIALLY- SO THAT TO ME IS A HUGE ISSUE JUST GIVEN. A LOT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP OBVIOUSLY I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT- BUT WHAT. IS THE VISION FOR THIS IF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY. I MEAN I KNOW WE WANT TO REDUCE. EMISSIONS OF COURSE BUT HOW I MEAN WHAT. AND HOW DOES THAT REFLECT WHEN. WITH THESE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES MANY OF WHICH I REPRESENT YOU REPRESENT MANY OF US DO. TO SELL THIS BACK HOME TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN INVEST IN KNOWING THAT THERE'S NEW TECHNOLOGY ON THE HORIZON THAT MAY BE MORE BENEFICIAL FOR THEM AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN I'VE HEARD. LOUD AND CLEAR FROM EVERYONE WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. BUT WHAT WHAT IS THAT VISION FOR THEM. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I APPRECIATE IT. SO I THOUGHT THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DID A REALLY ELEGANT. JOB OF THEM AND I AGREE WITH SENATOR STERN I THOUGHT THE ANALYSIS WAS REALLY WELL DONE IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE. BECAUSE CARBON SEQUESTRATION CAN- CAN. SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE POLLUTION IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES- SO LET ME JUST START OFF BY SAYING IT'S NOT MY INTENT. WELL SO WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE I'M GOOD AT WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL RIGHT NOW- GIVEN THAT WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS. IS TO MIRROR WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING. BECAUSE LIKE IT OR NOT IT IS IT IS COMING THEY ARE ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS AND THEY'RE WORKING THROUGH A PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO PERMIT- CARBON CAPTURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND SO WE NEED TO MEET THEM AS PARTNERS AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW YOU WANT IT TO OPERATE. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS WELL- THERE THERE FUNDING PROGRAM IS- A TAX CREDIT IT'S CALLED FORTY FIVE Q. AND THAT FORTY FIVE Q. AS IT AS I UNDERSTAND IT AS IT IS PASSED TODAY THE FUNDING FOR THAT.DID NOT INCLUDE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY- I'M AND- M. IT MIGHT MY COMMITMENT IN TERMS OF STATE FUNDS AND MY A BILL DOES NOT TALK. TO STATE FUNDS IT DOESN'T INCLUDE A- A REQUIREMENT THAT THE STATE PONY UP SOME MONEY I EXPECT AT SOME POINT POINT WHAT IT IT WILL BUT- IF IT DID IT IT WOULD MAYOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND. NOT- NOT ALLOW RESOURCES FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY I THINK IT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S- CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT- THE- ANY NEGOTIATION REQUIRES GIVE AND TAKE SO I GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT I GET SOMETHING IN RETURN AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE NEGOTIATION ON THE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY JUST AS A STATEMENT IN A BILL- AND THAT'S PART OF THE NEGOTIATION I EXPECT IT'S GOING TO BE FINISHED- AND THAT THAT WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE TWO TO THREE WEEKS WILL HAVE THE STATEMENT ABOUT WHERE WE WANT- ALL ALL OF. OUR- DISCUSSION ABOUT BOTH CARBON CAPTURE AND BIOMASS AND IN OTHER WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE GRID RELIABILITY. AND THAT WE'RE CLEANING OUR AIR AND WE'RE MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS ALL OF THAT WILL BE WILL BE WRAPPED UP SO. AM I IT'S A IT'S A WAY AROUND THE BACK DOOR TO EXPLAIN. AN ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY BUT I'M IT IT IS NOT- I FIND THE EMPHASIZING ENERGY PRIORITIZING IT MAKING IT THE ABSOLUTE LAST PRIORITY- S. AS THAT A COMMITTEE AMENDMENT WAS IT WAS AN ELEGANT WAY TO DEAL WITH IT AND- YOU KNOW BEEN FRANKLY I WANT I WANT THE BILL TO MOVE SO THAT WE CAN FINISH THE NEGOTIATIONS AND- AND THEN. TO DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO WITH ENHANCE OUR RECOVERY. YES AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THAT AND I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THE ANALYSIS DID INCLUDE- A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION I THINK FOR ME AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE NEW TECH I WAS TRY TO LOOK AHEAD YOU KNOW. THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED- AND HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT THERE'S JOBS THERE BUT THAT ARE ALSO REDUCING IN CAPTURING EMISSIONS DOING BOTH NOT JUST THE REDUCTION BUT CAPTURING MA'AM AND- DOING ALL OF THAT BUT- I THINK SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GET MENTIONED IN HIS BILL I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S QUITE A FEW MOVING IN THE LEGISLATURE AS WE KNOW. THERE IS- A HE'S LOOKING AT THE NEW TECHNOLOGY SORT OF SIDE OF THINGS AT A TO BE HOUSED WITHIN THE ENERGY COMMISSION WHICH I THINK THIS MIGHT BE YOU KNOW BETTER OPPORTUNITY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER. IT I DON'T KNOW IF MAYBE YOUR SUPPORTERS AS WELL COULD MAYBE ANSWER THIS TO LIKE WHAT IS THE HORIZON FOR THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY AND HEARING DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE WHAT CAN WE LOOK FOR TO IN TERMS OF THE TIMELINE FOR THAT STRATEGY HORIZON. IN IN NEW TECHNOLOGY- I MY EXPERT ON THE ON THE PHONE I'M NOT SURE SHE SAID ON THE PHONE- BUT- I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I CAN ANSWER IT MYSELF I WHAT I DO KNOW HERE HERE'S HERE'S- MY ANALYSIS OF THAT. OF AN ANSWER THAT'S NOT TOTALLY COMPLETE BUT- ONE OF THE ONE OF THE- THE THINGS I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS. A GRID RELIABILITY FOR ME MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO A GREEN TECHNOLOGY. AT THE LEVEL AT WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED RATHER THAN AT A AT A REALLY LOWER LEVEL WHERE THEY CANNOT SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. BUT THE OTHER PART IS TO SIGNAL TO THE MARKET IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA'S COMMITTED TO. SO THAT WE GET THE INVESTMENT APART FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IN TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL HELP US TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS AND THAT'S- THAT'S PART OF A TICKET REALLY BEING ABLE TO SAY WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS WE SET GOALS WITHOUT KNOWING IF WE'D EVER GET THERE. AND WE SET GOALS WITHOUT HAVING ANY OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THAT WOULD THAT YOU COULD POINT TO SAY WE'RE GONNA GET THERE- WE JUST KNEW WE HAD TO WE HAD TO DO IT AND THIS IS PART OF THAT. THAT MOVEMENT WHICH IS TO SIGNAL TO THE MARKET THE CALIFORNIA IS- IS. WE EXPECT THE HIGHEST QUALITY WE EXPECT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MEET YOUR- YOUR- YOUR TARGETS AND- WILL HOLD YOU TO THEM. AND WHAT WILL SET SOME REAL HIGH STANDARDS FOR IT AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO THE BEST AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS. IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TO HAVE THE INVESTMENT HAPPENING CALIFORNIA AND TO HAVE IT IT- ARE LEADING SCIENTISTS INVOLVED. AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR MAJOR UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE WORKING ON ON ON THIS ON THE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT ARE ARE. TALKING ABOUT IT. I THINK THERE I AM FROM ANOTHER A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO TALK ABOUT ARE THINGS LIKE DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AND THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY AND HONESTLY- DIRECTOR CAPTURED CAPTURED HERE TO FROM AMBIENT AIR YOU'LL STILL NEED A PLACE TO PUT IT USED ON THE THAT'S THE QUESTION- AT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS COMING IN THE FUTURE IT WILL BE HUGE HOWEVER WE STILL NEED TO GET THE GEOLOGIC SEQUESTRATION PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE FUTURE. I THINK THAT CHRIS HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO MENTION AS WELL. THE YOU KNOW SERWIS- REPRESENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THERE THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT AREAS WERE GREENHOUSE GASES ARE EMITTED SOME IS FROM TRANSPORTATION SOME AS FROM- ENERGY PRODUCTION SOME IS FOR MANUFACTURING SOMERS FROM AGRICULTURE- THERE'S THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER WITH GREEN HYDROGEN STEEL PRODUCTION- CEMENT PRODUCTION BUT YOU CANNOT ELIMINATE- GREENHOUSE GASES COMPLETELY YESTERDAY I WAS AT A GROUNDBREAKING FOR A LIGHT RAIL LINE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH IS GONNA NEED STEEL IT'S GONNA NEED CONCRETE. TO BE ABLE TO HELP US MOVE TRANSPORTATION AND MOVE CLEANER TRANSPORTATION BUT WE STILL NEED STEEL AND WE NEED STILL THAT'S PRODUCED LOCALLY WE STILL NEED CONCRETE AND THERE THERE'S JUST CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO I MET GREENHOUSE GASES CARBON CAPTURE MITIGATES THOSE AND THAT'S THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE NOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER LIKE WE ARE IN THE APPLICATION. TO EXPAND GREEN HIGHER CHEN AND HAVE CALIFORNIA BE A LEADER ON IT AS WELL AS ALL OTHER FORMS BUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE NEED- AND WE NEED. ALTERNATIVE FUELS NOW AND WE NEED. CARBON CAPTURE NOW FOR THAT THANK YOU. YEAH I THANK YOU AND I AND I WOULD I LIKE TO KIND OF KEEP PLEASE FEEL FREE TO JUMP BACK IN- CENTER GONZALEZ AS BECAUSE I DO WANNA SPEND MORE TIME DISCUSSING. THIS YOU CONTROVERSIAL BILL I MEAN I THINK I'M HERE TO BE HONEST I AM FEELING AS A COMMITTEE THAT- WE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF VERY INTENSE NEGOTIATIONS WITH. CENTER THE MONNING CENTER MCGUIRE IS PART OF THIS SUB COMMITTEE OF THE CLIMATE WORKING GROUP OF WHICH MANY OF US ARE A MEMBER- THERE'S A- KIND OF A- POTENTIAL GRAND BARGAIN TO BE STRUCK I THINK THEY'VE CENTER LEMOND'S BILLS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. THAT STORY- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. YOUR STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT THAT THAT WILL ENSURE THAT THAT THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE NO STATE MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH THE L. R. ASSOCIATE WITH THIS BILL- YOU KNOW THAT THE SO THAT THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT AND WE ALSO KNOW COURSE THE BILL'S GOING OVER TO NATURISTS HORSES AND I WOULD. HAVE BEEN CERTAINLY ASK AND EXPECT YOU TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR TO MAKE SURE THAT A NUMBER OF THE- RECOVERY OIL EXTRACTION ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BOTH IN THE ANALYSIS. AND BY THE PREVIOUS TWO. I SPEAKERS WILL BE WILL BE WORKED ON AND ADDRESS AND I MEAN I THINK ULTIMATELY THIS IS AN UNUSUAL KIND OF BILL IT'S NOT A STANDALONE BILL BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE BROADER CONTEXT OF THIS. CLIMATE WORKING GROUP NEGOTIATION AND WE WANT TO GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TAKE TO KEEP YOUR VEHICLE MOVING- WITHIN THAT CONTEXT- SO CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT I'M ON IT SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE- NATURIST ARSES IN WATER COMMITTEE AND- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO STRIKE A DEAL. ON ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE BEEN RAISED BY. THE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW WHEN A BILL GOES OVER THERE. I'M I MAY DO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE HEARING. CONSISTENTLY HERE IS. YOU KNOW ENSURING AND I WAS ABOUT A LOT OF FRIENDS FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY THAT ARE HERE THAT ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THIS BILL. I AND- YOU KNOW WHILE IT'S BEING PRESENTED AS A PRO CLIMATE MEASURE RIGHT WE NEED TO. ENGAGE IN THIS TO ADDRESS OUR CLIMATE NEEDS IS AS ELOQUENTLY STATED BY OUR FRIEND FROM THE BUILDING TRADES- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS NOT USED AS A- EXCUSE TO OR OR OR JUSTIFICATION FOR. DOUBLING DOWN ON. ON FOSSIL FUELS. ARE WHICH WE NOW ARE YOU KNOW SUCH A DRAMATIC CONTRIBUTOR TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT'S I THINK THE CHALLENGE HERE RIGHT ABOUT THAT SADDAM'S WITH YOUR BILL TO BE HONEST. I'M GIVEN THE POSTURE OF OUR COMMITTEE AND OUR CONCERNS HERE ON ON ON THE CLIMATE ISSUES AND SO. ON IF I COULD I GUESS PLEASE I AGREE WITH THAT I MEAN I DO I A. M. I UNDERSTAND. THE CONCERN- I THINK THAT THAT THE BILL RIGHT NOW. IT DOESN'T- IT IT IT'S NOT A SIGNAL THAT THAT YOU ARE IS- THE ENHANCE OUR RECOVERY IS- SOMETHING THAT EITHER IS GOING TO BE FUNDED BY THE STATE OR THIS GOING TO BE PART OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE'RE WORKING ON HERE TODAY- BUT- AND I HATE. WHEN I'M LOOKING FOR IS A TRANSITION AWAY FROM. FOSSIL FUELS THAT GIVES US SOME STEPS TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE. I'M NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS. I THINK I THINK ALL THE EXPERTS AGREE. THAT WE CAN'T REACH OUR CLIMATE GOALS GIVEN WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY. ME NOT THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY DISAGREEMENT WHERE PEOPLE SAY YEAH YOU COULD- AND YOU CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT THAT IS IN A CRIPPLING THE ECONOMY. AND SO WE NEED TO I MEAN THAT THIS IS IF THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT CALIFORNIA IT'S THAT WE'RE WE'RE RISK TAKERS AND WE GET OUT THERE WE GET THINGS DONE. RIGHT I GUESS WE DO WANT TO BE CAREFUL TO CONSIDER THE RISK RIGHT I MEAN I GUESS ABSOLUTE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT HOW DO WE MAKE I MEAN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT. YOUR EFFORTS. I'M DON'T END UP- LOCKING IN LIKE A LONGER TERM DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUEL. I DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS VIA I MEAN I IT'S C. I. CALIFORNIA I MEAN I LOOK AT IT AS- WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO BE GREENER. BUT BUT BUT PART OF THAT COMMITMENT HAS BEEN TO EXCLUDE. SOLUTIONS BETTER LOGICAL AND THEY GET US THE IN IN IN INCREMENTAL STEPS TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO. AND IT'S EITHER SOLAR OR ITS WIND AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THEM WILDLIFE IMPACTS OF THOSE TWO TYPES OF ENERGY. I DON'T ONE IS YOU KNOW MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT BUT WHEN YOU'RE KILLING BIRDS AND THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE HAVING TO. TECT SOLAR- ARRAYS BY PUTTING UP FENCES YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE DISTURBING WILDLIFE YOU'RE NOT YEAH- ALLOWING THE LAND IS WHY YOU'RE BIG SUPPORTIVE ROOFTOP SO INSTEAD OF IT DOES YEAH ABSOLUTELY I AM I AM OKAY I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE P. S. B. YOU SEE THAT NO I WILL I WILL CERTAINLY BUT BUT BUT BUT IT'S GOT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND SO WE CAN'T BE PURISTS IN THAT IN THE IN THE STRICTEST SENSE WE'VE GOT TO BE LOGICAL IT'S GOTTA MAKE SENSE WE'VE GT TO BE DOING THINGS THAT- THAT WE WERE WE TO REDUCE THE RISK THE RISK OF BLACKOUTS AND BROWNOUTS- THE RISK. THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY. THE RATES ARE GOING TO BE SO HIGH THAT IT'S GOING TO BE EATEN NOT ECONOMICAL FOR THEM AND HEATER OR TO CALL THEIR THEIR UNITS IN IN MY DISTRICT HAS SOME OF THE HOTTEST TEMPERATURES IN THE SUMMER IN THE COLDEST TEMPERATURES IN THE WINTER. SO I WANT A GRADE THAT'S RELIABLE I WANT. JAVA JOBS FOR PEOPLE AND I AND I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO TRANSITION NATURALLY WITHOUT HAVING TO CREATE A FUND. SO THAT WHEN THEY BECOME UNEMPLOYED WE GIVE THEM A HAND OUT THAT'S ONE HUNDRED AND YOURSELF. PARDON ME OF EQUITY FUND IS IN THE BILL YOU'RE DOING WITH CENTER LAYERED IT IS NOT IT IS THAT THERE THIRD THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF MOVING PIECES AND SO THE- I MEAN YES THAT WE GOT TO THAT RIGHT AWAY AND I WILL TELL YOU MY FRUSTRATION IS THAT. WE PUT CARBON CAPTURE BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLOSE SO COMPLICATED AS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT AND WE IT'S JUST HASN'T HAPPENED AND SO. YEAH IT'S A IT'S A CIRCUMSTANCE OF TIMING AND SO I DO A POP I UNDERSTAND. HOW HOW- HOW CHALLENGE THIS IS- FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT I'M JUST ASKING FOR SOME PRACTICAL- AT FIRST FOR A PRACTICAL. LOOK AT HOW THIS WOULD WORK. AND WE'RE NOT DONE YET. YOU KNOW WHAT. I'VE GOT TO GET PAST AS SENATOR STERN. YOU KNOW. AND AND I THINK BY THE TIME TIME WELL. DEPENDS ON WHEN THE HEARING. BUT BUT BUT I YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE CHANGED TO THE BILL. THAT'S THE POINT. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND I AND IS THIS A AYE. AYE- YEAH. AND HONESTLY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I DON'T SEE THIS BILL AS A- GO PAST WHAT IS IT GO PAST JAIL OR WHATEVER GET OUT OF JAIL- TO THE OIL INDUSTRY AT ALL RIGHT ARE THEY INTERESTED IN THIS ABSOLUTELY AND- AND BUT BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T DOESN'T ADDRESS. DOESN'T GIVE THEM THAT GO PAST- GET GET OUT OF JERICHO I THINK THE KIDS ARE I MEAN LOOK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY IN OUR CONVERSATION. ON THE CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY- OUR LITTLE ON THE PHONE BUT I'VE HAD A MEETING WITH THEM SO I GOT TO HEAR SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS- YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM IS THAT. THIS TECHNOLOGY PROMISES A LOT AND DOESN'T END UP DELIVERING IN ITS APPLICATION. I'M CERTAINLY YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW. HERE I AM WORKING ON A PLASTICS BILL THAT'S ULTIMATELY VERY. DEPENDENT UPON INNOVATOR STEPPING UP AND YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO SCALE. OUR TECHNOLOGY THAT- THAT REALLY WILL MEET THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE. OF COURSE IN THAT CASE- THEY'VE GOT. EXIT ARE. YOU READY TO GO TO MARKET- BUT ONE OF THE POINTS THAT SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE FINAL COMMITTEE OF RACES THAT- THAT DAILY SO FAR. WITH THE UCCS HAS HAS CONSISTENTLY UNDER DELIVERED IN TERMS OF. OF ITS OF ITS CLIMATE- BENEFITS ADOPTING SAID IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO INNOVATE INTO BETTER. I'M WE DO NEED. A LOTS OF TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL. AND I'M IN THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU'RE- YEAH I KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A- MEMBER OF THIS OF THIS CLUB IS WORKING GROUP IN AND WORKING REALLY HARD ON THE INTERNET. TO GET- OF THESE ISSUES RESOLVED WITH SENATOR LIMÓN AND OTHERS SO- SO MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SENATOR- I'M OR START THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF THE- WHICH I AM. EXCITED ABOUT I'M EXCITED ABOUT HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS WE SHOULD HAVE HAD ABOUT AND I KNOW THERE'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS THIS BILL BUT I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD. FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT HAS. HAS GRAPPLED WITH OIL IN CALIFORNIA AND I AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR SOME TIME AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EXECUTIVE ORDERS WE TALK ABOUT GETTING WHERE WE WANT TO GO IN CALIFORNIA LEADING AS A STATE AND TRYING TO LEAD THE WORLD. IN THIS DIRECTION WE PUT WE PRODUCE 1% OF THE GHG FOR THE WORLD. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TARGET TO SAY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NON COMBUSTIBLE. NOT FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA CARS THAT ARE USED COMMERCIAL INTERESTS THAT IS AGGRESSIVE. WHEN WE HAVE A GREAT DAY DOESN'T WORK AND TEACH YOU WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT ABOUT WE LOVE SOLAR WE LOVE NGUYEN. BIOMASS NOT SO MUCH A LOT OF A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE DON'T LIKE THAT EVEN THOUGH. WE KNOW THAT WE CAN SEQUESTER CARBON AT A HIGHER RATE WE ACTUALLY THIN THE FOREST. BECAUSE THE TREES GROW FASTER NAY SEQUESTER CARBON THAT CARBON STORAGE. AND WE DON'T LOOK AT THAT AND THEN AND THEN INTO. THE SENATOR STERN'S COMMENTS ABOUT WE BUY THOSE CREDITS IN AN IT BURNS UP AND THEN WE WOULD- THOSE THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE HAD. A LONG BEFORE WE'RE HERE WE'RE AT TODAY. AND WE DON'T HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WE SET TARGETS. AS CALIFORNIA'S IN THE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE GOING. AND SO I COMMEND YOU. FOR TAKING ON A TOPIC AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME OTHER MEMBERS THAT ARE CARRYING LEGISLATION BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY. AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN IT COMES TO CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE. DEALING WITH THE COST OF FUEL TODAY. BECAUSE OF OUR POLICIES. AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT WHEN WE IMPORT. OIL FROM ECUADOR HAS NO REGULATIONS ON IT AT ALL LIKE THEY DO IN CALIFORNIA AND DESTROYING THE AMAZON RAINFOREST WHILE WE HAVE. LABOR AND FOLKS WHO CAN EXTRACT OIL IN CALIFORNIA'S SAFER THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND NOT HAVE TO PUT IT ON A SHIP. BRING IT HERE AND WE FIND IT HERE. THIS IS CYCLE THAT'S CRAZY WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT HERE LET'S TALK COMMON SENSE AND THUS GET DOWN AND WORK ON THESE ISSUES AND- STOP ARE BIASED TOWARDS. ONE TECHNOLOGY OR OR ANOTHER. AND LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET WE'RE GOING TO GO SO IF WE WANT TO GET TO WHERE I WANT TO GET IS I'D LOVE TO GET TO. ELECTRIC CARS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE BECAUSE OUR GRID. IS NOT THE SHAPE IT NEEDS TO BE IN WE QUITE FRANKLY BILL TRANSMISSION LINES IN THE STATE. WE ARE OVER PRODUCING POWER. IN SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE SOLAR THERE THAN AND WE CAN'T GET THE POWER TO WHERE WE NEED IT. DURING THE TIME OF DAY THAT WE NEED ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS. BUILD A TRANSMISSION LINE. AND WE HAVE THE LABOR FORCE TO DO IT. BUT WE HAVE WE DON'T HAVE THE ENVIRONMENT HE STOPS LL THOSE. BOTH WAYS TO GET THERE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT TO LOOK AT THE STATE HOLISTICALLY. AND SAY WHERE DO WE NEED THE POWER WHEN WE NEED IT AND- HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE SO. I'VE BEEN SO FRUSTRATED OVER THE YEARS SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE TALKING ABOUT ONE. ONE SOLUTION. TO A REALLY COMPLICATED PROBLEM. STATEWIDE I THINK YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING HERE AND I THINK WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT OIL. I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. CALIFORNIA WILL. PRODUCING OIL HERE UNTIL WE CAN GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE DON'T NEED IT. WHICH WE WILL NEVER GET THERE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA FLY ELECTRIC PLANUM TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN ONLINE. YEAH IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN SO LET'S BE REAL AND LET'S BE HONEST WITH CALIFORNIANS. BECAUSE THEY'RE QUESTIONING WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THE ELECTRIC RATES ARE HIGH. THEIR FUEL IS HIGH AND IT'S BECAUSE THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT HERE. SO I'M ON YOUR TEAM I'M GONNA VOTE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY AND I'M I KNOW ONE IS SEND A MESSAGE TO THE LABOR COMMUNITY. INTO THE OIL COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THEY'RE LINED UP TODAY. BUT WE NEED WE NEED REAL SOLUTIONS WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. THE GRID. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BIOMASS WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE TO REEK TO CAPTURE FROM THESE ARE ALL SHOULD BE IN THIS IN THESE TALKING POINTS AND I KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO NOT TO RESOURCES WERE A LOT OF THAT CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE HAD BUT WE CAN'T JUST BE PURIST IN CALIFORNIA AND SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE THAT WE'RE GONNA DO IT THIS WAY WHEN IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED AND WE- WE NEED TO WEAN OURSELVES. OFF OF. THESE PRODUCTS THAT WE USE IN A MANNER THAT KEEPS CALIFORNIANS. ABLE TO LIVE HERE IF YOU'RE ON A FIXED INCOME. IF YOU RETIRED ON A FIXED INCOME YOUR STRUGGLING IN CALIFORNIA DAY AND IS QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE- OUR ENERGY COST AND ARE IN A COST OF LIVING I HIGH IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU'RE A WILL HOURLY WAGE EARNER. YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THOSE FOLKS BECAUSE THEY'RE HURTING. HURTING REALLY BAD TODAY AND SO I'M HAPPY TO SEE THIS MOVEMENT FOR I'M SUPPORT TODAY BUT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO SIT DOWN AND OUT I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A WORKING GROUP BUT I THINK WE NEED TO NOT HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I MEAN YOU SAY YES TO SOME THINGS THAT'LL GET US THERE OVER THE LONG HAUL SO. I COMMEND YOU I AND I AM EXCITED ABOUT RELEASE I KNOW YOU'LL DIG IN IT AND AS THE CENTER SAID PUT YOUR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING HARD DECISIONS YOU YOU CARE THOSE KIND OF BILLS AND I WANT TO BE ON YOUR TEAM TO GET US THERE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SKINNER THANK YOU. MICHAEL THANK YOU I'M HAS ANYONE MOVE THE BILL YET. I HAVE. BUT NO I CAN'T WE CAN'T I'M SORRY YOUR CALF YEAH SORRY GREAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE I WAS GOING WITH THE BILL YEAH- HEY. FIVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS SO SEVERE WE NEED EVERY TOOL AND WE ARE I AM A COMPLETE- IT COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO TRANSITIONING OFF FOSSIL FUELS BUT WE ARE IN THE MIDST RIGHT NOW OF STILL NEEDING. WHETHER IT'S CEMENT CONCRETE STEEL YOU NAME IT FOUR WHETHER IT'S TO- YOU KNOW FIX OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD NEW HOUSING. AND WE'RE NOT AT THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE EITHER FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THOSE PRODUCTIONS WITHOUT ANY FOSSIL FUEL OR WITHOUT ANY CARBON EMISSIONS I MEAN CEMENT FOR EXAMPLE HAS IT IN PROCESS EMISSIONS- AND- YET WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THAT CARBON GOING TO THE ATMOSPHERE. NOW CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT IS. IT HAS I THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE- UTILITY GRADE BATTERIES WHEN I DID THE BILL ON UTILITY GREED BATTERIES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. HE WORKED AVAILABLE THEY WERE POLITE YET THEY WERE IN YET NOW CALIFORNIA'S THE LEADER AND UTILIZED- GLOBALLY AND- WE HAVE TO GET TO THAT PLACE WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. NOT AS A REPLACEMENT TO REDUCTION. BUT IN THE NORWEGIAN THAT WE HAVE TO GET KEEP THAT CARBON FROM GETTING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. SO THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. I DO NOT WANT TO USE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE AT ALL FOR- ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE BUT I DO THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO USE IT IN CERTAIN OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES. THAT FOR WHICH WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW ONCE WE'VE- FULLY EITHER VENICE SUFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE WITH THEM OR- YOU KNOW FULLY REDUCE THE EMISSIONS AS MUCH AS WE CAN. THAT WE UTILIZE THIS AND WE SEE OTHER COUNTRIES BEGINNING TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE SEE A LOT OF RESEARCH THERE'S A GREAT REPORT IT CITED THE ANALYSIS FROM LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LAB- AND I. TOTALLY APPRECIATE THE FIERCE THAT. IT WOULD POTENTIALLY PROP UP THE FOSSIL FUEL SYSTEM BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE I THINK WE ARE IN THAT TRANSITION BUT THAT TRANSITIONS GOING TO TAKE AWHILE AND WE NEED TO GET THE CARBON PREVENTED FROM GOING THE ATMOSPHERE. SO. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TECHNOLOGIES THAT SHOULD BE LIKE- NEVER TOUCH IT HANDS OFF BUT I THINK WE- THE CRISIS IS SO SEVERE RIGHT NOW. THAT WE HAVE GOT TO USE EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLKIT. AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING IT BUT AS I SAID WELL THE BILL DOESN'T COMPLETELY PROHIBIT. THE OIL AND GAS I MEAN THE OIL RECOVERY. ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T GET UTILIZED FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT I CERTAINLY. THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR MOST AT OTHER OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND- THAT'S WHY I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. AND SENATOR JUST I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE BUT THE AUTHOR DID. JUST SAY ON THE ON THE ON THE DIETS THAT TIME SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE A WHITE OKAY PART OF THE FRAMEWORK. OF THIS BILL AND SHE'S INVOLVED IN THIS NEGOTIATION WITH MONIQUE THAT INVOLVES BILLS ON THIS TOPIC AND THREE. I THINK THAT ISSUES THAT THAT ISSUE WILL BE ADDRESSED. A CENTER BATES. I YEAH I THOUGHT. MY ON. YEAH I THANK YOU I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD YONGE ARE PUTTING YOUR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL ALREADY. HAD TO CONVINCE OUR MANY THAT WE NEED THIS TOOL. I THINK IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD REALITY CHECK. ON THE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID IT WAS ALMOST LIKE SHE'D READY AIM WHEN WE DECIDED WE WERE GONNA GO WITH. JUST TWO TECHNOLOGIES. WHEN THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WE NEED TO OUR VITAL AND DO YOU HAVE- THE CARBON EMISSIONS SOUL. CAPTURING THOSE AND ALL THAT'S BEEN SAID BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM TOTALLY. UNDERSCORE THE GREATNESS OF YOUR BILL IN THE DIRECTION YOU'RE TAKING US IN. SO YOU HAVE MY STRONG SUPPORT AND I WANT TO PROVIDE. THE OIL INDUSTRY AND OUR UNIONS AND OUR OUR TRADES. FOR WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THIS THING IS GOING TO REALLY WORK OUT IN A LONG TERM THAT WE HAVE THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOU AND- YOU HAVE MY VOTE. NO CERTAINLY MY STRONG SUPPORT. AS YOU GO FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR THANK YOU I'M ANYMORE COMMENTS. FROM THE MEMBERS. OKAY WITH- YOU MAY CLOSE CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THIS IS JUST NOT EASY- AND THERE ARE A LOT OF FEARS BUT I THINK THAT- WELL. I WILL MAKE THE COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH- EVERYONE- AND I THINK THAT CLIMATE. GROUP THAT THAT'S DOING THE WORK- AND ALSO- CHAIR STERN WHEN IF THE BILL IS- PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY WOULD GO TO HIS COMMITTEE- AND THIS ISN'T THE END THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK TO HAPPEN AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SURE- AS MANY PEOPLE AS AS A POSSIBLE. THAT- WERE. THAT EVEN DESPITE THE FEARS THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT WEEK THAT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO AND WILL DO IT IN THE SAFEST. AND MOST RESPONSIBLE WAY POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO SEND THE SIGNAL THAT WE WANT TO SICK TO SEND THAT- CALIFORNIA WANTS TO BE ABLE TO REALLY MEET OUR GOALS THAT THEY WERE. THAT THEY WERE SET AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE AND THAT PROTECTS ALL CALIFORNIANS SO THAT'S MY COMMITMENT- AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THE CENTER. CONSUMPTIONS CHOLERA. THE ITEM NUMBER FOUR S. B. ELEVEN OH ONE BY SENATOR CAFIERO THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THAT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER ALAN HI ALAN I'D BATES BATES AYE DALI DALI I GONZALEZ. SKINNER SKINNER AYE STERN BY CASKEY MY CASKEY I. OKAY I WILL EITHER OPEN FOR THEM SAID THANK YOU CENTER. OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S GO WITH THE SENATE- THIS IS- ITEM TWO. SB TEN THIRTEEN AND IT'S CENTER ATKINS BILL BUT YOU'RE VERY GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO. SENATE EVEN THOUGH NOT A CO AUTHOR YOU BECOME COST THE PRINCIPLE OF IT PRINCIPLE COUGH OKAY GREAT OKAY BE TOO GRATUITOUS MISTER JARRETT- IT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POLICY DEBATES AT A COMMITTEE THAT I'VE HEARD IN MY EIGHT YEARS- YOU KNOW IN THE LEGISLATURE I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THAT THAT THAT THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. SO WITH THAT LET'S GET TO ANOTHER PORT IMPORTANT ITEMS YEAH. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS- RECOMMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THE BOX WINES ARE PART OF THE PROGRAM. ALONG WITH WINE IN GLASS CONTAINERS AND ALSO DELAY THE OPERATIVE DATE OF SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW TO ENSURE THE VENDORS ARE NOT% PENALIZED FOR GOODS ALREADY. IN THE STREAM OF COMMERCE. TURNING TO THE BILL SB TEN THIRTEEN IS THE PROTONS AND MY MEASURE TO ADD WHITED DISTILLED SPIRITS TO CALIFORNIA'S SUCCESSFUL BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM TO INCREASE RECYCLING RATES ARE TO PROVIDE CONVENIENT RECYCLING OPTIONS. FOR CONSUMERS. CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING AND LITTER REDUCTION ACT TOOK EFFECT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IS SUCCESSFULLY RESULTED IN DRAMATICALLY INCREASING RECYCLING FOR ALUMINUM GLASS AND PET PLASTIC BAG CONTAINERS. HOWEVER SINCE IT WAS ENACTED THE PROGRAM SAID GAPS OF SORTS IN THAT WINE IS DISTILLED SPIRITS CONTAIN. CONTAINERS THAT MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER WEIGHS THREE HAVE NOT BEEN- RECYCLABLE. UNDER THE PROGRAM. THIS CREATES A- IN THE PROBE. AND FOR CONSUMERS WHO HAVE HAVE TO PAY THE COST RECYCLING WINE AND DISTILLED SPIRITS COMPUTERS AS FAR AS THEIR MONTHLY GARBAGE AND RECYCLING BILLS. SB TEN THIRTEEN REMEDIES THIS PROBLEM BY ENSURING WHITED SPIRITS BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE TREATED EXACTLY THE SAME AS OTHER BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. UNDER THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM CENTERS MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT THIS IS A STARK CHANGE IN LAW THAT IS FORTY YEARS INCOMING. I WANT TO COMMEND THE PROTEST AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATES IN THE WHITED DISTILLED SPIRITS INDUSTRIES FOR COMING TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THIS LANDMARK PROPOSAL. I HAVE TIM SCHMELZER- FROM THE WINE INSTITUTE AND MARK MURRAY FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AS ARE TO LEAD WITNESSES. HEY GOOD MORNING. MISTER TERRY COMMITTEE- TIM SCHMELZER VICE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA STATE RELATIONS FOR WINE INSTITUTE- ONE INSTITUTE REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND- FAMILY OWNED WINERIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I AM HERE TO EXPRESS THAT ONE INSTITUTE SUPPORTS THE INTRODUCTION OF WINE INTO THE BOTTLE BILL IF AMENDED. LET ME REPEAT WINE INSTITUTE ACTUALLY SUPPORTS THE INTRODUCTION OF WIND INTO THE BOTTLE. I'M SURE SOME PEOPLE JUST FELL OVER. LET ME EXPLAIN A RATIONALE AND- IN THE NEED FOR SEVERAL AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. A FIRST OF ALL WE HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT CALIFORNIA'S WIDESPREAD USE OF SINGLE USE RECYCLING BINS IS SIMPLY NOT GETTING IT DONE FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE KNOW WE NEED OUR GLASS BOTTLES AND OTHER RECYCLABLES TO BE SEPARATED FOR THEM TO ACHIEVE THE RECYCLING RATES THAT ARE INDUSTRY STRIVES FOR. AND THE FACT ON THE GROUND IS THAT THE BOTTLE BILL IS THE PROGRAM THAT CAN DO THAT. HOWEVER WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF ONE INTO THE BOTTLE BILL THERE ARE SEVERAL UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY THAT NEED TO BE KEPT IN MIND. FIRST THERE ARE OVER FORTY TWO HUNDRED WINERIES IN CALIFORNIA- THERE OVERWHELMINGLY A SMALL FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES. SECOND ONE IS A VERY UNIQUE PRODUCT IT IS OFTEN BOTTLED IN H. TWO YEARS BEFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO MARKET. AND THIRD. THE INDUSTRY'S BEEN EVOLVING- WE HAVE AN ATTEMPT TO BOTH ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND CONSUMER CONVENIENCE THAT EXPLORING THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE CONTAINER TYPES OUTSIDE A GLASS BOTTLE SUCH AS BACK IN THE BOX. WE APPRECIATE THE MOMENTS OF BEEN PER FOURTH BY THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THESE CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE IN THE LEAD TIME WILL BE NECESSARY FOR COMPLIANCE. AND THAT BAG IN THE BOX AS AN ELIGIBLE CONTAINER TYPE. WE ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL ISSUES ARE GOING TO COME UP RELATIVE TO THE UNIQUENESS OF OUR PRODUCT AND OUR INDUSTRY AS WE WORK TO INTRODUCE ONE INTO THE BOTTLE BILL. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE PRO TEM SENATOR DODD AND THE COMMITTEE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO ADDRESS THEM AS THEY ARE IDENTIFIED THANK YOU. MARK. MISTER MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE GRATEFUL FOR CENTERED TO CENTER DOT FOR HIS WORK FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ON THIS ISSUE GRATEFUL FOR THE PRO TEMS INTRODUCTION OF THIS MEASURE FRANKLY GRATEFUL FOR US CENTER WHITE CAL SKIS INTRODUCTION OF THE SAME PROPOSAL THAT PASSED THIS COMMITTEE FIVE YEARS AGO YESTERDAY- IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME GOAL TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO INCLUDE WINE AND DISTILLED SPIRIT CONTAINERS. IT IS FRANKLY FASCINATING TO ME AND IN A REASON FOR CELEBRATION THAT THIS PROPOSAL TODAY IS BEING DRIVEN BY MANUFACTURED DEMAND FOR THE RECYCLED MATERIAL ON WE'RE GONNA HAVE ALL THE SAME BENEFITS OF REDUCING LITTER AN INCREASING RECYCLING BUT THIS IS BEING DRIVEN BY GLASS BOTTLE MANUFACTURERS AND FRANKLY I THINK IF THEY WERE HERE PT BOTTLE MANUFACTURERS WHO NEED THIS SECONDARY MATERIAL. TO PRODUCE CONTAINERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH LESS POLLUTION LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO THAT'S SOMETHING WORTH CELEBRATING- MAYBE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S BOTTLE AND CAN RECYCLING LAW AS IT RELATES TO THE BUY BACK RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE MANY COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE FARM ARE LACKING CONVENIENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR REDEEMING CONTAINERS THERE ARE ALSO MANY COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE THAT HAVE EXCELLENT BUYBACK RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND BETTER THAN 80% RECYCLING SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE COMMUNITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES COUNTY LIKE. THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT HAVE 80% BETTER RECYCLING BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF BUYBACK RECYCLING CENTERS PER CAPITA WE LOOK AT THE NORTH COAST WE LOOK AT THE BAY AREA OF CALIFORNIA THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BY BACK RECYCLING CENTERS TO ACHIEVE THE RECYCLING OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROGRAM NOW THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP WE KNOW THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL ADD SIXTY FIVE TO EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN INCREASED SCRAP VALUE IN PROGRAM PAYMENTS TO THE RECYCLING IN FOR. SURE IT WORKS OUT TO ON AVERAGE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BY BACK RECYCLING CENTER PER MONTH IN INCREASED VALUE SO THAT'S GOING TO HELP. BUT WE'RE STILL GONNA DO YOU NEED TO DO MORE TO BRING BACK BY BACK RECYCLING CENTERS TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THEM FOR THIS PROPOSAL- THERE'S THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL FINALLY HAS PUT FORWARD SOME THAT TOLD US ALL HOW MUCH. SURPLUS MONEY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE ON SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THIS EITHER IN THIS BILL OTHER BILLS OR FOR IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. BOTTOM LINE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THIS LEGISLATION I'M IT'S GONNA INCREASE GLASS RECYCLING IS GOING TO INCREASE MARKET DEMAND FOR- THIS MATERIAL AND WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. MR MURRAY OTHER FOLKS WANNA VOICES SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BOB ZERO ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS THE E. AND J. GALLO WINERY AND ITS AFFILIATES IN STRONG SUPPORT.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATT BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS AND SUPPORT PAGE CENTER DODD THAT'S GREAT- THERE WE HAVE LINE THIRTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOLDSMITH WITH INDIAN RECYCLING THE TWO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL BUT WE ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND AN IMPLEMENTATION DATE THE AFTER THE BELL WE RECOMMEND FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU. AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE BEEN HERE RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT. I THANK YOU SO MUCH LET'S NOW AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO HAS THE- VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL THIS SB TEN THIRTEEN ANYONE HERE PERSON. ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES. A MODERATOR. IF YOU WISH FIFTY. REGARDING THE SB TEN THIRTEEN PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. AT ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR PHONE. AND I HAVE NO ONE IN CARE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO LET'S GO TO THE- THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THOUGHTS SENATE ONLY JUST A SO WHAT ABOUT THE I MEAN WHO STATED THERE ARE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED SMALL WINERIES OUT THERE NOT MOST OF THOSE ARE. OURS WHAT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN I MEAN I OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THE BIG PRODUCERS SO TWO QUESTIONS ONE OF ABOUT TE SMALLER- WHAT HOW THE IMPACT OF THE SMALLER- PRODUCERS AND THEN ALSO- SITES FOR RECYCLING I KNOW THERE'S LIKE VERY FEW AT LEAST AT MY DISTRICT THERE I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY. QUITE FRANKLY. WELL THE FIRST WELL I THINK THAT- MR MURRAY- YOU KNOW LAID THAT OUT PRETTY WELL AND I HOPE I THINK MR SMITH- SMELTERS GONNA. COME UP AND TALK ABOUT THE SMALL PRODUCERS I KNOW THAT IN MY DISTRICT THE SMALLER PRODUCERS- YOUR BEHIND THIS WE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE NAPA VALLEY VINTNERS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF- VIDEO GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH APPRECIATE THE QUESTION A CENTER DOLLY- WHAT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED TO. MEMBERS OF EVERY SIZE WITH AN ORGANIZATION AND WE HAVE ALMOST UNANIMOUS SUPPORT- OUR MEMBERS REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF RECYCLING- PROGRAMS- THAT BEING SAID SOME OF THE FEATURES OF BEING A SMALL WINERY ARE ARE UNIQUE YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. ALLOW ADEQUATE TIME FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES TO COME UP TO SPEED WITH THIS I THINK THERE IS- YOU KNOW BRINGING IN WINE IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN BRINGING IN- OTHER PRODUCTS WHERE THERE MAY BE ONLY FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS BRING PRODUCTS AND- SO IMPLEMENTATION DATE WHICH IS ALREADY- SOMETHING THAT'S MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS IS IMPORTANT- ONE THING WE MENTIONED IN THE LETTER WE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE- WINERIES. COULD BE CONSIDERED A DEALER AND HAVE TO TAKE BACK PRODUCT WE DON'T WANT THAT. FOR EXAMPLE AND- AND- AS I MENTIONED I EXPECT WE'RE GOING TO COME ACROSS A FEW OF THESE- AS WE MOVE THROUGH. I THINK WE HAVE A STRONG COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHOR AND SENATOR DOT THAT WE'RE GONNA WORK THROUGH THIS AND MAKE SURE IT WORKS FOR. OUR INDUSTRY. SO JUST A FOLLOW UP THAT'S THAT'S THE KEY BECAUSE I WHEN I WAS THAT IN. IN OTHER RECYCLING PROGRAMS WHERE THEY BE THEY ARE HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK AND THERE'S- NO PLACE THEY DON'T BECOME A RECYCLING CENTER IF THEY DON'T. AND I KNOW THAT ISSUE CAME UP BEFORE. AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION IS DO IS THEIR PRICE PER. BOTTLE WHAT WAS I DIDN'T SEE. IT IS- AMOUNT. TRANSACTION SINCE OKAY. OKAY OTHER THOUGHTS GOING HERE MOTION FROM A MEMBER YES THERE WOULD HAVE ALL PEOPLE LIKE TO BE CENTER BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ON THE MATTER BEFORE US BUT I WILL MOVE THE BILL THAT'S GREAT- AND I DO WANNA I WANNA I DM I WANTED OBVIOUSLY I THANK YOU CENTER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP OF THE PROTON MATCH I DO ALSO WANTED TO SIGNAL ITS- CINEMA CASKEY IS LONGSTANDING WORK IN THE SPACE- WHERE IS THE BILL GO IS IT.

OKAY I SEE CENTER PORTIS'S HERE TO PRESENT S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTEEN. COME ON UP. I SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WARNING. WHAT TIME NOW IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE WEEKS MAN YEAH I'LL WAIT HE JUST. FLYING THROUGH THE BREEZEWAY JUST A MOMENT EARLIER. YEAH WE IT'S A IN A CRAZY WAY WHICH IS WHAT DESTRUCTION THESE RIGHT WITH SCHEDULE OKAY- GOOD MORNING- MISTER CHAIR IN MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTEEN A BILL THAT SEEKS TO CODIFY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN NEIGHBORS FOR SMART RAIL VERSUS EXPOSITION METRO LINE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY. THAT'S A MOUTHFUL. FIRST I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS MEASURE I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINE ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. ALSO UNDERSHIRT THAT MY INTENT IS TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS MEASURE TO MAKE FURTHER AMENDMENTS IF NECESSARY WHILE CONTINUING WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE MEASURE. THE CALIFORNIA BAR MIDDLE QUALITY ACT SEQUEL WAS AN ACTIVE OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO. TO ENSURE THAT STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THEIR DECISIONS. WHEN APPROVING A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PROJECT. AND WHILE THIS LAW HAS UNDOUBTEDLY DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB. IN PROTECTING AND CONSERVING NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE STATE. IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT THIS LONG. HAS BEEN USED TO FACILITATE COSTLY LITIGATION NEEDLESS LITIGATION. THIS PURPOSE IS OFTENTIMES ON RELATED TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. IT NEIGHBORS FOR SMART RAIL V. EXPOSITION. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HELD AND I QUOTE. INSUBSTANTIAL OR MERELY TECHNICAL MISSIONS ARE NOT GROUNDS FOR RELIEF UNDER SEQUEL THAT OUR MISSION IS PREJUDICIAL QUOTE IF IT DEPRIVED THE PUBLIC AND DECISION MAKERS OF SUBSTANTIAL RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT LIKELY ADVERSE IMPACTS. IF ENACTED THIS BILL WOULDN'T WOULD WOULD UPDATE SEQUEL TO REQUIRE A FINDING THAT AN AGENCY CAUSED PREJUDICIAL VIOLATION OF THE ACT BEFORE COURT CAN ISSUE AN ORDER DIRECTING A LEAD AGENCY OR REAL PARTIES IN INTEREST TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS. THIS CHANGE WOULD HELP LIMIT THE NUMBER OF FRIVOLOUS SUITS THAT ARE FILED EVERY YEAR UNDER SEQUEL BECAUSE IT WOULD ENSURE THAT ONLY THOSE CASES WITH MERIT WILL SUCCEED IN OBTAINING RELIEF. TODAY I AM JOINED. BY ADAM RELIGION OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WILL BE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTEEN. THE CENTER ADAM THIS YEAR MORNING YEAH AT A RALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- SORRY WE HAVEN'T GOT A LETTER AND WE WERE WAITING TO SEE HOW THE IMAGE CHECK OUT BUT WE OVERALL OUR CHRISTMAS SUPPORT LETTER AND APPRECIATE THE- COMMITTEE WORKING WITH- THE CENTER ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE- THE BILL'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IT IS EFFECTIVELY CODIFIES A CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED THE NEIGHBORS FIRST MORRELL DECISION. AND BECAUSE SEE WHAT LANDMARK ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IS ENFORCED ENTIRELY BY CITIZEN LAWSUITS MOST ARE MERIT BUT THERE ARE CASES WHERE HE WAS ABUSED FOR A REASON TO BE ON THE ENVIRONMENT AS A SENATOR NOTED. AND SO THIS BILL- BASICALLY MAKES CLEAR FOR THE LOWER COURTS- BY CODIFYING THAT DECISION THAT ONLY- SEQUEL VIOLATIONS THAT HAVE PREJUDICIAL NATURE TO THE PUBLIC SHALL BE GROUNDS FOR VACATING ADR OR MND AND SENDING IT BACK TO THE BEGINNING AND UNDER ALL A LOT OF THIS IS WE SEE IN A SEQUEL THEY ARE NOT NOTICING THIS SUPREME COURT DECISION AND THEY ARE VACATING ER'S FOR MERE TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS THAT ARE NOT PREJUDICIAL. THAT SLOWS DOWN PROJECTS WHETHER IT'S HOUSING OR OTHER DEVELOPMENT LAND USE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BUT- I THINK ONE STEP IN THERE PRETTY REFORM PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THE- SEQUEL IS NOT ABUSED BUT- INTEREST ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION FOR PROJECTS- BEING DEVELOPED IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE LOOKING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE I THINK THIS IS ONE STEP FORWARD TOWARDS THAT SO WE SUPPORTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU JOHN. ALL RIGHT- OTHER FOLKS OF WE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR WHO WANTS TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR. S. B. ONE ONE ONE EIGHT. ELEVEN EIGHTEEN. NOW OKAY I DON'T BELIEVE WE IT ANYONE WANT TO VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. HERE IN PERSON. CAPTION. MODERATOR HI ARE YOU ARE YOU THERE. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE AND FEDERAL WE'LL START WITH LINE EIGHTEEN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE DAILY AVERAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND FROM THE PORT THANK YOU. AND ONE MOMENT WHILE WE GET A LINE NUMBER FOR OUR NEXT PLAN. LINE SIXTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME IS DOUG FIRST INFORMATION VERY STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I JUST WONDER IF YOU CAME IN STRONG OPPOSITION PLACE. AND I HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. OKAY R. I. C. A. SOMEONE HERE WANTS TO VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY QUEST ON BEHALF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU MODERATOR ANYONE THE PHONE LINES OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. ONCE AGAIN AT EIGHT ONE AND ZERO ON YOUR PHONE. AND I HAVE NO ONE IN KILL VOICE HER POSITION ON THE BILL- MY NAME'S LORRAINE CHILSON AND I VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL ANYTHING SMART IS DANGEROUS FOR US. I'M AGAINST IT. OKAY I'M GREAT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO LET'S. LET'S NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION. I'VE CENTER CASKEY. I'M THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SO WE'RE GOING TO JUST LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD TO JUDGES ARE GOING TO BE INSTRUCTED NOT TO GO BEYOND AND USED THEIR OWN SEARCH SEARCHES ON THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PORTION BECAUSE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION IS CONCERNED THAT THEY HAVE TO. RENDER A FINE BEFORE THEY CAN ISSUE THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD- BEFORE THEM RIGHT N. AS IN ORDER TO. ISSUE AND CHECK HEIR CONSIDERING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THEY HAVE TO FIND IRREPARABLE HARM RIGHT SO. I GUESS OCCURRENCE YEP PARDON PREJUDICIAL OCCURRENCE RIGHT SO. EXPLAIN YOUR THOUGHT- HELP ME BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING IF THE COURTS ARE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING WHAT IS IT SMART TRAINED. WITH NEIGHBORS FOR SMART RAILS SO WE'RE WE'RE SAYING WE WANT ALL THE COURTS TO LOOK AT SMART REAL OUR NEIGHBORS ARE SMART REAL AND USE THIS PROCESSING ON WHETHER IT'S- SIGNIFICANT OR INSERT- INSIGNIFICANT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD- WHICH ISN'T THAT EASIER FOR A COURT TO AT LEAST MAKE SOME FINDINGS THE SCRIPT THEY HAVE EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM. AND THE GUIDANCE OF THIS THIS COURT VERSUS. VERSUS MAKING IT TOO DIFFICULT I GUESS MY THIS IS A IS THAT CLEAR IF I MAY AND BY THE WAY YEAH FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ALLOW ME TO ALSO BRING UP MORGAN AND ADAM BACK UP WHO COULD PROBABLY OFFER SOME INSIGHTS. AS WELL. I THINK WHAT. THE SUPREME COURT ON THE IN ITS DECISION. WAS PUT WAS POSITING IS THAT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DERAIL A PROJECT OR CHALLENGE A PROJECT. THAT YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY THAT BECAUSE OF A MISSING COMMA HERE OR TECHNICAL ISSUE ON RELATED. TO THE ACTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL MERITS THAT THAT TECHNICAL VIOLATION. NEEDS TO DATE BE DEMONSTRATED AS BEING. PREJUDICIAL IN ITS OUTCOME THAT THERE BE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. NOW WHAT THE COMMITTEES- THE COMMITTEE AT THE MID COMMITTEE'S REQUEST WE HAVE WITHDRAWN THE DEFINITION. OF CANVAS- YET YEAH PREJUDICIAL LACK OF COMPLIANCE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT- IN A MORGAN DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS TO THE SENATORS POINT YEAH JUST TO DIRECTLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YES- ANY PARTY WHO IS CHALLENGING THE ADEQUACY OF AN E. I. R. IS ONLY LIMITED TO THE EVIDENCE THAT'S IN THE RECORD WHICH WOULD BE A LOT YOU KNOW CONSIDERING HOW MASSIVE THESE DOCUMENTS ARE SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. TO WORK WITH THE FIND EITHER NO COMPLAINTS OR COMPLAINTS AND TYPICALLY IT THE E. R. R. IS FILED THE COMPLAINT IS FILED AND THEN THE JUDGE IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WANTS TO ISSUE AN INJUNCTION TO SAY DON'T JUST STOP WITH THIS NORMALLY YOU DON'T GO FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT IF YOU'VE GOT A YOU'VE GOT A LAWSUIT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S DANGEROUS FOR THE LEAD AGENCY YOU KNOW I SORT OF BY FILING THE CASE THERE'S- INJUNCTIVE RELIEF NOT DIRECTLY BUT PER SE BUT IF YOU IF YOU ASK FOR THAT ADDITIONAL. UNCHECKED OF RELIEF I WOULD IMAGINE TO BE THE PLAINTIFF. NOT THE LEAD AGENCY RIGHT. AND THAT WOULD BE PART OF PRAYER WHEN THEY WHEN THEY THEY FILED A- BUT AGAIN THE LEAD AGENCY JUST FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES CÁC WE'RE GONNA GO FORWARD. WITH IT WITH THE SUIT ENACTED IN THE WE DON'T HAVE TO. THE CLEAR AND SO I SEE THE CONCERN I WANTED AN OBVIOUSLY THE JURORS COULD WORK WITH YOU ON THOSE. THE LANGUAGE ON THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF BUT I WAS JUST TRYING TO. CLEAR THAT UP AND SINGLE YOU GOT A LAWSUIT HERE. RIGHT SO. IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SIMPLY DIDN'T SEE SEE WE DON'T CARE UNLESS YOU CAN JOIN US AND THEN. AND THEN THEY THEY'VE GOT THE RECORD AND THEY'VE GOT. A D. NEIGHBORS HAVE. JUST TO CLARIFY YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE STRIKING THIS THIS. ADVERSE IMPACT DEFINITION NOT THE PRESIDENT'S LACK. OF COMPLAINTS RIGHT IN THE MEN'S. RIGHT HE'S GONNA WORK ON LANGUAGE RIGHT I BY THE WAY THE THING I MEAN IF IT'S OUT OF. DATE I MEAN. CRITICAL TO ALL THIS FOLKS IS THAT IT'S HEADING TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. WHICH IS WHERE I WAS GOING. WHERE WHERE SAID WITH SENATOR AND I'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE I THINK I THINK THIS IS THIS A- LOOK I MEAN I WANNA I WANNA THANK YOU CENTER FOR ACCEPTING THEM IT'S I MEAN I THINK IT'S THIS IS NOT AN EARTH SHATTERING BILL BUT- AS I WAS CONCERNED THE WAY YOU HAD IT ORIGINALLY WRITTEN BUT THE I THINK THESE CHANGES MAKE IT VERY FAIR. I THINK IT'S VERY REASONABLE TO BE HONEST- IKNOW THERE'S SOME CONCERNS- PROP SIGNIFICANT OVER A JUDICIARY AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK THOSE OUT OVER THERE I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY STARTED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- THIS COMMITTEE YOU KNOW M.

THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS. WORKING ON A RIVER VALLEY ELEMENT NEW RIVER ALONG THE BORDER I REPRESENT THE ENTIRE BOARD OF CALIFORNIA MEXICO AND COURSE WE HAVE A CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES WITH THE WITH THE WATER BODIES THAT- UGH UGH BISECT THE BORDER. SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IS A LOT OF- BUT DEBRIS. ENDS UP COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM- RAINFALL EVENTS AND SEWAGE FLOWS- ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONTAMINANTS ARE OUR TIRES THE POSE. AN ENORMOUS THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO TO PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE WATER GATHERS. ALONG THE RIM RIM OF THE TIRE IN A IS A BREEDING GROUND OFTENTIMES FOR PESTS AND MOSQUITOES. WHICH TRANSMIT DISEASES SO- BEEN WORKING VERY HARD OVER THE YEARS ON CLEANING UP THESE WATER BODIES IT'S VERY COSTLY COSTLY PROCESS TO GO INTO. THESE A LARGE ESTUARIES REMOVE TIRES OFTENTIMES ARE BURIED DEEP IN THE GROUND OTHER TIMES. THEY'RE A AFFECTING A VERY IMPORTANT HABITAT. THIS BILL. WAS CONCEIVED WORKING TOGETHER WITH CAL RECYCLE. AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA WE'VE DECIDED TO WORK ON A PROGRAM TO LIMIT. THE TRADE OF TIRES OFTENTIMES USED TIRES THAT ARE NO LONGER USEFUL IN THE UNITED STATES ARE SOLD BY COMPANIES INTO MEXICO WHERE THEY'RE RE USED. AS TIRES OFTEN TIMES THE GROOVED AND PAINTED TO LOOK LIKE NEW TIRES BUT THEY'RE VERY DANGEROUS TIRES YOU KNOW AS PEOPLE ARE GETTING. TIRES THAT ARE REALLY NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AND THEY OFTEN CAUSE ACCIDENTS. SO THIS IS A BI NATIONAL EFFORT TOGETHER WITH THE- COUNTRY OF THE STATE OF. CALIFORNIA TO LIMIT THE SALE. SO ESSENTIALLY WORK IN OUR CYCLE WOULD OF- WE TOOK SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND CREATE THIS BILL. WITH THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE COVER CYCLE TO STRENGTHEN THE CALIFORNIA TIRE TRACKING SYSTEM. TO QUANTIFY MORE PRECISELY THE NUMBER OF USED TYRES FLOWING FROM CALIFORNIA. AND FROM OTHER STATES THROUGH CALIFORNIA INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NEAR THE NEARBY STATE OF SONATA. IT REQUIRES COVER CYCLE TO WORK WITH THE UNITED STATES CONS CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION TO OBTAIN DETAILED DATA. ON A CALIFORNIA USED TIRE EXPORTS TO THE STATE OF BUG CALIFORNIA INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE PORCH OF WRECKED VEHICLES. AUTO DISMANTLE OURS IT PROHIBITS A PERSON FROM SELLING AN UNSAFE USED TIRE AS DEFINED FOR USE BY A MOTOR VEHICLE ON A HIGHWAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE OUR ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES THESE THESE TIRES CAN BE USED ON ON COMMERCIAL VEHICLES SOUTH OF THE BORDER. AND PUTS- PEOPLE'S LIVES IN AT RISK AND WE WANT TO LIMIT THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND- WE THANK OUR CYCLE FOR THEIR COOPERATION HELPING US ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. AND WE THANK YOU MISTER AND YOUR STAFF FOR HELPING US WITH THIS BILL AS WELL. AND I JUST WANTED TO- STATES THAT I BELIEVE. THAT- YEAH I THINK I COVERED EVERYTHING.

AND- I HEAR MOTIONS. YES SEND US A LONG ON I'M NOT MOVING THE BILL OKAY- OKAY. HELLO YES I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF GET WE JUST HAD A BILL EARLIER. THE CARD SENATOR KIRBY THERE WAS BILL WE TALKED ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW SETTING TARGETS AND DATE. IMPACT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT HOW THE PROCESS LOOK SO I'M I'M THINKING OF. JUST MY DISTRICT ALONE WE HAVE. STATE HIGHWAYS THAT. HAVE VEHICLES THAT WOULD SHOW CALTRANS USES VEHICLES. THAT ARE. EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED POUNDS AND HEAVIER SNOW PLOWS SNOW BLOWERS- ALL THOSE ARE. GOING TO BE REGULATED BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO BE ZERO EMISSIONS AT- TWENTY SIX TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT YES- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS EVEN AVAILABLE TO MEET THAT IF IT'S IF IT'S ZERO MISSION AND WE'RE USING HYDROGEN I'M NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE FACILITIES TO EVEN WHAT'S THE PROCESS OF GETTING WHERE WE'RE GOING I MEAN I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SETTING A TARGET. AND I'M CONCERNED THAT. YOU MEET YOU MEETING THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE I DON'T BELIEVE IS IN PLACE SO CAN YOU EXPAND ON WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE. ABOUT TO GET. TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO. CERTAINLY THE- THE HEAVY DUTY ART IS A- TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TARGET. AND WHILE THAT MAY SEEM VERY. YOU KNOW. IT'S LIKE TOMORROW IT'S NOT. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ADVANCEMENT THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS OF EV'S. IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES TODAY AS COMPARED TO EVEN TWO YEARS AGO. IT SIGNIFICANT. AND WE IF YOU ARE MONITORING ANY OF THE TRADE PUBLICATIONS BASICALLY EVERY. VEHICLE MANUFACTURER IS NOW PUTTING OUT MODELS OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. SO I. I THINK THAT IT'S- NOT- ON. AND SUBSTANTIATED TO PROJECT THAT WE WILL HAVE. THOSE OF YOU A FAVORABLE VEHICLES AT THAT POINT AND- AND THAT WILL. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THE GOALS NOW CLEARLY A RB HAS THE ABILITY TO MODIFY IF WE FIND THAT AT THAT POINT WE'RE NOT. BUT THIS IS YOU KNOW COULD BE A STRETCH GOAL BUT WE'RE BASICALLY THE STATUS ALREADY BY EXECUTIVE ORDER INDICATING THAT WE WON'T SELL COMBUSTION VEHICLES JUST A FEW YEARS HERE AFTER. SO WE'RE SENDING ALL THE RIGHT MARKET SIGNALS FOR SUCH TECHNOLOGIES IN VEHICLES TO BE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE. I JUST VOTE I'M GONNA I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK THAT IT'S PREMATURE I THINK THE TWO GOALS ARE GREAT BUT AT IN THE DAY CALIFORNIANS. ARE EXPECTED IF THEY'RE GONNA BE PAYING MORE ANY PAYING AS TAXPAYERS TO RETROFIT OR TO EXCHANGE OUT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF CALIFORNIA THAT. THAT CALIFORNIANS RELY ON TO TAKE CARE THEIR PUBLIC SERVICES AND IN FOR EXAMPLE. THE SNOW PLOWS AND TRUCKS AND HEAVY DUTY EQUIPMENT THAT WE USE EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. IS GOING TO BE IN PLACE AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE YEAH WE'RE MOVING FASTLY TO- YOU KNOW ELECTRICAL VEHICLES BUT WHEN YOU START GETTING TO THE HEAVY DUTY I MEAN WE TO AND WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION TRANSPORTATION- ABOUT THE PORTS. AND ABOUT. DRIED STRIKES IN AND THEY HAVE A STRUCTURE THERE AS WELL AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE OUT IN THIS IS A LARGE STAT. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN ALPINE COUNTY WHICH I REPRESENT TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE THERE IS THERE THERE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE SOME. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'LL WORK I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CHARGE THESE VEHICLES TO OR IF IT'S HYDROGEN WILL HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT SO I'M LOOKING AT WHAT TECHNOLOGY GOING TO WORK IN ALPINE COUNTY OR- OR- TO. WHERE WE HAVE YOU KNOW. FIFTEEN FEET OF SNOW SOMETIMES AND THE BILL THE BILL TO KEEP PEOPLE MOVING I THINK THIS IS A VERY- RISKIER. ABOUT I WAS DOESN'T DIRECTOR FOR THREE RIGHT THREE CONCEPT FOR SPONDON THAT THIS IS PER PURCHASE RIGHT BY THE STATE'S AND- WE DON'T THE STATE DOESN'T REPLACE VEHICLES ON AN ANNUAL ALL VEHICLES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THERE ARE LONGER TERM SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ALL. OF THAT EQUIPMENT TO BE ON TO BE SEVENTH THAT YEAR JUST THE NEW PURCHASE BUT THERE'S ALSO THE BILL ALREADY HAS BUILT INTO AN OFFRAMP FOR DGS. TO INDICATE THAT THERE'S NOT AN AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY SO IF WE HAVE NOT ACHIEVED THOSE AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES BY. THE TIME THERE IS OFFERING IN THE BILL. FRANK OKAY. MMHM ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS CONCERNS QUESTIONS- THE MOVE BY CENTER GONZALEZ. CONSULTAS CORAL I WAS ARE YOU MAY CLOSE I'M SORRY I ASKED FOR A VOTE. I THE NUMBER ELEVEN SB TEN TEN BY CENTERS SKINNER THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALAN HI ALAN I BATES. IT'S NOT VOTING DALLY KELLY NO GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I SKINNER BUT SKINNER AYE STERN AYE CASKEY. GREAT ALL RIGHT AND THREE VOTES SO WE'LL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN. BUSTER YEAH I YEAH WE CAN THIS GARDEN OKAY I SEE SENATOR LEONYS HERE TO PRESENT HER SB TWELVE THIRTY. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS SB TWELVE THIRTY WILL STREAMLINE THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA HAS TO INCENTIVIZE CONSUMERS TO SWITCH TO LOWER EMISSION VEHICLES THIS BILL REQUIRE CARP TO SINGLE PORTAL WHERE A PERSON CAN APPLY FOR ALL OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS ONLINE. MAKING THE NETWORK OF PROGRAMS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCESS THERE IS ALSO THERE CAN ALSO BE A LONG PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN A PERSON APPLIES TO ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WHEN THEY RECEIVE THE INCENTIVE UNFORTUNATELY MANY PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT MONTHS. TO GET A NEW VEHICLE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCESS IS NOT A BARRIER FOR GETTING AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE FINALLY THE BILL WILL EXPAND TO CLICK EXPAND THE CLEAN CAR FOR ALL PROGRAM ACROSS THE STATE INSTEAD OF IT BEING LIMITED TO INDIVIDUAL AIR DISTRICTS. AT TODAY WE HAVE- BENJAMIN I CURRENT THE DIRECTOR OF LET'S GO GREEN CALIFORNIA AND CAMILLA CHÁVEZ THE DIRECTOR OF THE ARTIST THE FOUNDATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. CHAIR ALLEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS VERY MUCH MY NAME IS BENJAMIN I KERR AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE ROMERO INSTITUTES. LET'S GREEN CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE AND WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF SB TWELVE THIRTY. FIRST I WANT TO THANK SENATOR LIMON FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL IN THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR HARD THOUGHTFUL WORK. TO PROTECT OUR SHARED ENVIRONMENT. IS YOU KNOW EMISSIONS FROM CARS AND TRUCKS HAVE LONG BEEN A THORN IN CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO ATTAIN SAFE. HEALTHY AIR QUALITY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE CONDUCTED OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AND LOW AND MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES. TO HELP THEM GET INTO CLEAN CARS DOING THIS WORK WE LEARN THAT WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS STRONG PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT% ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AND THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE DONE A LOT OF GOOD WORK. UNFORTUNATELY THE INCENTIVE LANDSCAPE IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. THERE ARE PROGRAMS EACH WITH ITS OWN APPLICATION AND ITS OWN TIMING FOR APPROVAL IN USE. IN PRACTICE THESE PROGRAMS DON'T MEET THE NEEDS OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME RESIDENTS. WHO EIGHT DON'T HAVE THE EXPENDABLE INCOME TO BE ABLE TO BUY NOW AND RECEIVE A REBATE LATER. AND TO BE WHO TEND TO DRIVE THEIR CURRENT VEHICLE UNTIL IT BREAKS DOWN. WHICH MEANS WAITING PERIODS ARE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WHEN THEY NEED IT. THAT NEED IS URGENT. BY SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INCENTIVES UNDER A ONE STOP SHOP. AND MAKING FUNDS AVAILABLE AT POINT OF SALE. SB TWELVE THIRTY AIMS TO ENSURE THESE PROGRAMS BETTER SERVE THOSE WHO NEED THE MOST. ADDITIONALLY WE FOUND A LACK OF ACCESS TO PUBLIC CHARGERS. IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CREATES AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER TO ADOPTION. INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT LAGS BEHIND DEMAND. IN THIS DYNAMIC NEEDS TO BE FLIPPED. THE SECOND PART OF SB TWELVE THIRTY ALTHOUGH. AND LANGUAGE. COOLEY AIMS TO ACCELERATE THE BUILD OUT OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ENSURE THAT INVESTMENT IS EQUITABLE. AND SUSTAINABLE IN CONCLUSION SB TWELVE THIRTY CAN HELP ENSURE. THAT AS WE PURSUE OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE GOALS. WORKING FAMILIES AND FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES ARE AT THE FOREFRONT. OF THAT TRANSITION. COMBINED WITH THE WORK FORCE STANDARDS ALREADY IN PLACE UNDER ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FORTY ONE. YOU CAN CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND GROWTH THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. CALIFORNIA WILL NEED WELL INTO THE FUTURE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON SB TWELVE THIRTY. AND APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CAMILA TRAVIS MD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DOLLARS WORTH THE FOUNDATIONS AND WE ARE PROUD SPONSORS. OF SENATE BILL TWELVE THIRTY BUT THE LOTUS WHAT THE FOUNDATION IS BASED IN BAKER SMELLED. AND WE WORK THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY NOT A SINGLE ONE. OF THE EIGHT. COUNTIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CURRENTLY HAVE SAFE LEVELS OF OZONE. AND SMART SMALL PARTICULATES THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD.
