PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AND YOUR CARD. YOUR EXPIRY HERE CENTER COME LONGER CENTER COME LONGER HERE SENATOR NELSON SENATOR NELSON HERE. WE ARE ALL PRESENT SO WE WILL BEGIN THE ITEMS PROPOSED FOR DISCUSSION STARTING WITH PROPOSALS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THE FIRST ISSUE IS ISSUE NUMBER FORTY THREE THE AUGMENTATION AND CONTINUATION OF RESOURCES FOR THE LICENSED PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS FROM MEXICO PILOT PROJECT AND I'D LIKE TO TURN THE MIKE OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND ASK- I BELIEVE WELL LET ME JUST LET M JUST CHECK AND SEE- IF. FOR STARTING WITH THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR OR DEPUTY DIRECTOR. FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD. OKAY LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD SO- THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS WILLIAM PASIFIKA. ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES I AM ON THE LINE. VERY VERY GOOD THERE YOU ARE AND SO YOU MAY PROCEED. OKAY WELL- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO OUTLINE WHAT THE ROLE OF THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS BEEN IN THE BACK OF THE CO PILOT PROJECT I THINK THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START. WELL ACCORDING TO MY TIMELINE THIS IS A PROJECT WHICH IS GOING ON FOR SOME TIME. FIVE COURSE ONLY ARRIVED IN THE SUMMER OF LAST YEAR. BUT BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS IN FRONT OF ME WE HAD THE FIRST MEETING- IN RELATION TO THE MEXICO PILOT PROJECT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- THAT'S WHEN WE FIRST BECAME INVOLVED. WE RECEIVED THE FIRST INSTALLMENT. OF OUR FUNDS IN RELATION TO THE PROJECT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND THEREFORE WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN THE INTERVENING PERIOD IS THAT THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF MILESTONES THAT HAVE BEEN REACHED. IN TERMS OF BRINGING. THE PROJECT TOGETHER. IT INCLUDED- BOARD STAFF RECEIVING A REPORT FROM A MEDICAL CONSULTANT REGARDING THE PROPOSED CURRICULUM FOR THE SIX MONTH ORIENTATION WITH RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WAS IN APRIL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IN JULY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE BOARDAPPROVED THE CURRICULUM FOR THE SIX MONTH ORIENTATION OUR PROJECT- IN AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND. FROM ONE OF THE CLINICS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT. I IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY WE RECEIVED DICK EXECUTED EXTERNSHIP AGREEMENTS BETWEEN UCSF AND ONE OF THE CLINICS AND THE OTHER CLINICS WERE RECEIVED LATER IN THE YEAR. ADDITIONAL INSTALLMENTS THE FUNDS WERE RECEIVED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND WHAT WE- BEAT THE LAST CRITICAL PART OF INFORMATION. WHICH WE RECEIVED. ARM WAS THE SIGNING OF THE INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT FROM UC DAVIS TO CONDUCT THE EVALUATION THAT WAS IN JANUARY OF TWENTY. BEEN PREPARED TO ISSUE LICENSES TO ALL OF THOSE APPLICANTS WHO MEET THE CRITERIA AS OF TODAY I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE TWENTY ONE LICENSES THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO ISSUE. AND WE ARE NOT ISSUING THEM AT THE REQUEST OF THE APPLICANTS BECAUSE THEY OF COURSE NEED TO GET THEIR VISAS THE R. LICENSES ARE GOOD FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT THEY WILL BE STARTING LATER IN THE SUMMER SO AT THIS POINT ACCORDING TO THE MEDICAL BOARD- ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE IN PLACE WE ARE READY TO ISSUE LICENSES. AND WILL DO SO AS SOON AS WE GET THE GO AHEAD FROM THE APPLICANTS. VERY GOOD- IT DOES THAT CONCLUDE YOUR PRESENTATION. YES I BUT I pDIRECTOR ON THE TCA SIDE WITH MAYBE LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE BUDGETARY POSITION. VERY GOOD DEAD DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND THAT WOULD BE THE FISCAL OFFICER TAYLOR CHECKED. THAT'S CORRECT. MY NAME ISTAYLOR SICK UNDER THE SCHOOL OFFICER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND- JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF OUTLINE HERE WHAT THIS REQUEST IS ESSENTIALLY DOING IS EXTENDING FUNDING- COMMENSURATE WITH THE TIMELINE FOR THE PROJECT RIGHT NOW- FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS THERE WAS A DCP THAT WAS APPROVED. FOR THE INITIAL START OF THIS PROGRAM BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THE LAST YEAR OF FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT IS ACTUALLY IN- THE SCHOOL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO HOWEVER THAT FUNDING LEVEL- ISN'T IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE NEW TIMELINE AND WITH THE CONTRACT WITHUC DAVIS SO WHAT THIS REQUEST IS ESSENTIALLY DOING IS PUTTING IN A REQUEST IN PLACE TO ALLOW- PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATION NECESSARY TO FULLY COMPLETE THE PILOTS- OUT THROUGH I BELIEVE TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. BRIGADES OUT SO THIS IS A REAL LINES THE ACTUAL TIME LINE OF THE PROGRAM. IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND. YES THIS WILL THIS WILL REALIGN THE FUNDING BANKS AND MEET THAT TIME MORE INCIDENTS SINCE THE TIMELINE SHIFTED A LITTLE BIT THERE WERE THOSE VARIOUS MILESTONES THAT THE- ARCTIC HERE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL BOARD MENTIONED- THE TIMELINE SHIFTED FROM WHERE WE THOUGHT THE TIME LINE WAS WHEN THE INITIAL PCP WAS SUBMITTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY SO THIS REQUEST IS JUST REALIGNING THAT FUNDING- COMMENSURATE WITH THAT TIMELINE. AGAIN THIS FUNDING IS FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE NONPROFIT PHILANTHROPIC DONATIONS FROM THE VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT ARE SPONSORING THE PROGRAM AND NONE OF THIS WILL IMPACT THE MEDICAL BOARDS ARE IN CONTENTION FOR VERY GOOD THANK YOU A FINANCE. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO FINANCE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THANK YOU. HOW ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SORT OF BORED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DID NOT RAISE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. VERY GOOD I'M GONNA ASK IF- ANY OF. THE SENATORS I HAVE A QUESTION ON THIS IS THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND INTO IT SO I'M REALLY EXCITED AND HAPPY TO SEE US HERE- WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE LICENSES TO BE ISSUED BUT I WILL CHECK IN WITH THEM- CENTER CAMEL OWNER THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRWOMAN- YOU KNOW I HAD ACTUALLY A QUESTION FOR- THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD BECAUSE I'VE ALSO BEEN GETTING SOME INFORMATION RELATED TO COST MANAGEMENT- AND SO JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF HE COULD MAYBE- WELL I THINK FOLKS HAVE QUESTIONS AROUND SORT OF- FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY- COST MANAGEMENT TOOK AROUND EXPENDITURES- I KNOW THIS IS UNRELATED BUT THERE AND- PROPOSING A FEE INCREASE AND SO AS WE'RE- LOOKING TO TAKE IN MORE REVENUES FROM THE STATE I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO KNOW THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING WELL MANAGED. SO YOUR QUESTION IS ADDRESSED TO- THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. VERY GOOD% MR PACIFICO IF YOU COULD JOIN US AGAIN AND- SEE IF YOU UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION BUT SHE WAS ASKING FOR YES ELL I MEAN I GUESS THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES HERE ONE IS THE QUESTION OF THE COST MANAGEMENT OF THE MEXICO PILOT PROJECT AND IF THERE ANY SPECIFIC ISSUES OR QUERIES ABOUT HOW THOSE NUMBERS WERE ARRIVED AT OUR TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE FUNDS OF COURSE WE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE SPECIFICALLY. AND WE HAVE THE PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS OF THE PROJECT IF THE QUESTION IS ONE ABOUT COST MANAGEMENT IN RELATION TO OUR FUND INCREASED WHICH OF COURSE IS A MUCH LARGER QUESTION I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES MYSELF I JUST ON THAT SECOND POINT YES WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE FEE INCREASE A FEE INCREASE WE HAVE NOT HAD FOR MANY YEARS I BELIEVE IT'S FOURTEEN YEARS DURING THAT TIME A LOT OF OUR COSTS HAD INCREASED. AND OF COURSE 80% OF ALL OF OUR WORK IN TERMS OF RESOURCES AND TIME IS RELATED TO ENFORCEMENT SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE IN THE BOUT THE YEAR THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE IS THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR ENERGY ON TRYING TO MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGE OUR LARGE PROGRAM OF CASE MANAGEMENT- WE ARE GETTING IN ON THE ORDER OF ELEVEN THOUSAND TWELVE THOUSAND COMPLAINTS PER YEAR. SOME OF THOSE CASES ARE EXTREMELY SERIOUS AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO TRIAGE THE CASES AND MANAGE THEM PROPERLY SO THE ONES THAT ARE LESS SERIOUS WE CAN DEAL WITH MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY DURING THE TENURE THAT I HAVE BEEN IN JUST IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS WE'VE REDUCED THE TOTAL CASES UNDER MANAGEMENT ACTIVE MANAGEMENT. ON THE ORDER OF 13% WHICH IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT A LOT OF OUR ENFORCEMENT COSTS ARE NOT UNDER OUR DIRECT CONTROL. WE OUTSOURCED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND% THE HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATIVE UNIT. WHO MANAGE THEM FOR US AND THAT'S REALLY THE COST IS BASED ON TIME SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BUILD UP OUR- CAPABILITIES INTERNALLY. ARE MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE CASES DEAL WITH THE EASIER CASES SIMPLY IN MORE EFFECTIVELY WE'RE WE'RE SEEING THAT HAPPEN. OUR NET FISCAL POSITION HAS IMPROVED FROM WHERE IT WAS IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR. BUT IT STILL REQUIRES THE NEED FOR A FEE INCREASE BUT I CAN. ASSURE EVERYONE HERE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR RESOURCES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PRESERVING RESOURCES FOR THOSE MOST SERIOUS CASES AND I THINK OUR NUMBERS DEMONSTRATE. THAT WE'RE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE'RE NOT SIMPLY LOOKING FOR A BLANK CHECK WE REALIZED THAT WE HAVE TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES. VERY EFFECTIVELY AND WE BELIEVE WITH THE REDUCTION OF TOTAL CASES UNDER MANAGEMENT THAT THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. NOW IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE MEXICO PILOT PROJECT AND SOME OF THE- OUR BUDGETARY MATTERS THERE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE THE QUESTION BUT THEN TO REFER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES. WHO IS MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS OF THAT. PROJECT VERY GOOD. I'M FINE THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION THAT WAS WHAT I WAS INTERESTED IN HEARING THANK YOU HEY WE'LL TAKE IT THAT MUCH SENATOR NELSON. NO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR NIELSEN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR BEING HERE TODAY THAT RECOMMENDATION STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO IMPROVE AS REQUESTED WILL BE TAKING UP THOSE VOTES AT A LATER TIME. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE SO THANK YOU I'M GOING TO MOVE ON TO. ITEM NUMBER FORTY FOUR WHICH IS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S THE FIVE ISSUE FORTY FOUR IS THE- C. A. DOT GOV RESOURCES AND ASK THAT. DEPARTMENT TO- PLEASE PRESENT. YES HI AND GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS AMY TONG ON THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO THE STATE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER JOINING ME TODAY ARE TO A COLLEAGUE OF MINE- BOTH ARE NEW TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ONE IS THAT THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR RUSS MICHAEL CAME FROM- CDCR AND ALSO OUR OUR NEW STATE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION OFFICER A GREAT CLOUD WHO CAME FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR BOTH JUST JOINED OUR DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- MERRILY FOR COUPLE OF A FEW MONTHS AGO- TODAY WILL BE PRESENTING YOU TO PROPOSAL BY SPEAKING WITH THE FIRST ONE ISSUE FORTY FOUR. SPECIFICALLY ON THE C. A. DOT GOV RESOURCES BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING- TO CONTINUE WITH THE OPERATION OF MOVING THE STATES- WEBSITES INTO A UNIFORM PLATFORM AND SO THAT THEREFORE TO PROVIDE TO A- UNIFIED EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE SIMPLIFICATION AND STANDARDISATION AND ADA COMPLIANCE NEED TO FOR THE WEBSITE TO ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE A MORE SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE- WITH DATA I'M NOT ONE TO SURE HANDED OFF TO RED CLOUD TO ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT BACKGROUND OF THE PROPOSAL AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. FROM THE COMMITTEE. RICK THANK YOU AMY. HI IT'S PLEASURE BEING- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. I THOUGHT I WOULD PROVIDE. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MOVING TO A CENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF. AFFAIRS IS WITH US- THE WEBSITES THAT ARE MAINTAINED ON CD INFRASTRUCTURE AND THOSE THAT AREN'T. ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY. WEBSITES ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT. AND NOT QUITE SIXTY OF THOSE ARE RUNNING ON THE CENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGED BY MY TEAM AT C. T. AS WE LOOK TO STANDARDIZE AND SIMPLIFY BOTH THE INFRASTRUCTURE ON WHICH THOSE SITES ARE HOSTED. AND THE OFFER CENTRALIZED SERVICES THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO ENSURE ACCESSIBILITY- INSURE THAT THEY'RE USING MODERN TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE PATCHED AND- AND SECUREWORKS- WE WANT TO MAKE OUR TEAM AVAILABLE AND MAKE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SITES THAT HOST. INFRASTRUCTURE WE MAINTAIN. AND PART OF THE GOAL OF THIS P. C. P. IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE STAFF AND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THAT- AS WE LOOK AHEAD- WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE A GROWING. DEMANDS DESIRE BY OTHER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE US AND LEVERAGE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT CTE IS DOING WITH THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. TO INSURE THAT WORD BEING AS RESIDENT FOCUSED AS WE CAN BE- AND ENSURE THAT THE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY ARE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE NEEDS. ALL PAUSE THERE BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER THERE ANY QUESTIONS. FROM THE COMMITTEE ABOUT POST CODE. OR WHAT WE INTEND TO ACCOMPLISH. DON'T LET ME FINISH. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LA- AND THEN WE WILL SEE IF THERE'S QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION AND- APPRECIATED VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ANY COMMENTS. BRIAN WANTED TO OPEN A FINANCE OR SUPPORT OF THIS FALLS SHORT OF NOTATIONAL COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. PRIME MINISTER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE HEARING AGENDA PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF OUR ANALYSIS OF THIS PROPOSAL- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THIS BUDGET REQUEST AS PROPOSED AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COMMENTS FROM SENATORS. NO COMMENTS FROM SENATOR NELSON I JUST HAVE- A QUESTION AND- YOU KNOW OUR OUR TECHNOLOGY. INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OUT THAT WAY AND IN MANY WAYS NEEDS ARE A LOT OF- UPGRADING OR UPDATING I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT AND- THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO DO THE UPGRADING INTERNALLY AND- AND IT'S A FAIRLY. A MODEST AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS AND SO ON I GUESS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE RESOURCES WE NEED AT AT A TIME THAT REALLY APPROPRIATE AND- THAT THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'RE REQUESTING ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET. THE TIME LINE THAT YOU HAD ANTICIPATED AND THE WORK PRODUCT YOU'RE INTO SPECIES COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT PLEASE I MEAN I I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. INTERNALLY BECAUSE WE CAN CONTROL THE COST I THINK A LITTLE BIT BETTER WE CAN BE SURE THAT. THAT ACTUALLY WORKS- BUT I WANT TO MAKE MAKE SURE THAT- THE DIGIT THERE SOME ASSURANCE THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET US WHERE WE WANT TO GO. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I'M OUT I'M SURE AND I APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION DIED- THAT. ASK IT'S MODEST BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO VERY MINDFUL THAT- THIS YOU KNOW. IT'S AN ADDITIONAL ASKED. AS IN BACK IN THE- EARLIER BY JAZZ WE DID ASK FOR A- LARGER AMOUNT FOR- THE SYSTEM'S STAR CRITICAL SYSTEMS THAT REQUIRE STABLE A STATION. AND THIS AND THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THAT TO HELP MORE. ON FROM THE FRONT OF ENHANCING. USER EXPERIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO A CALIFORNIA WEBSITES AND PARTICULARLY DEPARTMENTAL WEBSITES. AND I THINK WE WANTED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS AND BE A GOOD SCHOOL STORE OF THE FUNDING THAT IS BEING INVESTED IN TECHNOLOGY. AND TWO VERY MUCH TOO HOW YOU STATED WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE CAN DO THIS WITH THE INTERNAL. STATE RESOURCES AND TAKING A VERY MEASURED. INCREMENTAL STEPS TO ACHIEVE THIS- I'LL LEAVE IT TO. REST NICHOLS OR RICK IF THEY LIKE TO ADDED IN TERM OF OUR MEASUREMENT OF SUCCESS. AND HOW- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A MODEST. REQUEST WE CAN KEEP A VERY HEALTHY PACE. AND CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE EXPERIENCE OF WEBSITE- FOR STATE ENTITIES. IRAQ OUR REST FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN. I THINK COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR I CAN SAY THAT THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE- I THINK WE'RE PLAYING FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH I WAS. PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO SEE THEIR TEAM HAD ALREADY MADE A COMMITMENT TO BEST OF BREED PLATFORM FOR BOTH THE STORAGE OPERATION. AND MAINTENANCE OF THE WEBSITES THAT WE ARE MANAGING- WITH NCT. SO I THINK THIS IS AN INVESTMENT IN PRIOR- EFFORTS I DO THINK THAT TO- DIRECTOR THOMAS COMMENTS WE ARE WELL POSITIONED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT'S BEING ASKED- SPECIFICALLY ON BRINGING ADDITIONAL SITES ON BOARD. I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AS AN EXTENSION OF THIS AS WE BRING MORE SITES TO SEE DOT GOV- IN GENERAL THAT THE MORE THAT WE HAVE THE MORE POTENTIAL THERE IS FOR MORE LEVERAGE WHICH. COULD BE FURTHER INVESTMENT DOWN THE ROAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT AND- I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU CAME FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO YOU HAVE SOME PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCE AND- AND THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING AND IN THIS PARTICULAR FIELD SO APPRECIATE. APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION THAT WE MAY NEED TO SPEND MORE MONEY IN THIS AREA BUT IT WOULD BE TO BRING ON MORE RESOURCES AND- THE- BOOK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE MORE THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND OUT INFORMATION. ABOUT MY DATA NOW AND THEY WANT INFORMATION AND IT'S FRUSTRATING WHEN THEY CAN'T FIND. WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SO- IF THIS HELPS TO STREAMLINE THAT I. A. I'M ALL FOR IT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THIS IS A- APPROVED AS REQUESTED AND SO WE WILL BE TAKING ACTION LATER ON IN THE COMMITTEE HEARING AND APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING FOR BEING HERE TODAY FOR HIM TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER. FORTY FIVE. WHICH IS THE D. A DIGITAL IDENTIFICATION AND I GUESS AGAIN ASKED ON- DIRECTOR. OF STATE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER TOM GETS TO PRESENT ON THIS ITEM. YES THANK YOU ADVENTURE CONTINUING ON WITH THE ITEM FORTY FIVE I JOINING ME ALSO IS- RESUME COASTED UP DIRECTOR AS LONG AS RICK CLASS WAS GOING TO BE LEADING THIS EFFORT I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A BACKDROP AS I CAN TELL FROM THE STAFF REPORT AND- COMMENTS pTHOSE ITEMS THAT THERE'S THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF OPEN QUESTION.AND IT ACTUALLY THIS IS THE VERY MUCH ANTICIPATED FROM THE FACT THAT I DO- WE ARE SEEING THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY OPPOSED- CALLED IT THERE'S MORE MORE RELIANCE ON- USING THE DIGITAL MEANS AS AS A WAY TO OFFER PUBLIC SERVICE- BUT RECOGNIZING DIED. BECAUSE OF THAT IF NOT DONE CORRECTLY IT ALSO CREATES A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR FRAUD AND YOU KNOW FOR IN A SECURITY YOU KNOW CONCERNS AND THIS AND THAT AND THEREFORE- EVEN THOUGH IT'S A QUICK TURNAROUND TO PUT THIS PROPOSAL I WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT WE ARE BRINGING THE IDEA OF CREATING A SINGLE DIGITAL ID. AS A WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LOG IN I WOULD JUST AS A FRIEND OR TWO TO GET ACCESS TO THE VARIOUS SERVICES WERE BRINGING THIS IDEA S. AND A PLANNING EFFORT TO THE COMMITTEE TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR US SUPPORT FOR THE VERY VERY BEGINNING. WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASON WHY THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IS FAIRLY MODEST- BECAUSE WE JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW KICKED US OUT FOR OFF WITH A VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT AND ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITY- TO WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT NEED TO BE ENGAGED TO START THIS FROM THE VERY VERY BEGINNING. ON UNLIKE SOME OF THE PREVIOUS- PROPOSAL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IN FRONT OF YOU THEY TYPICALLY CALM YOU KNOW CAME TO YOU ALREADY WITH A LARGER AMOUNT IN PROBABLY A WELL WRITTEN- PROPOSAL- WHAT WE FEEL THE DIGIT- ID WORK IS SO. AND SO IMPORTANT DO WHATEVER TAKING INTO. OF AS A PART. THAT'S WHY WE'RE BRINGING IN VERY INITIAL CONCEPT AND DOING IT OPENLY- WITH A SMALL INVESTMENT OR MODEST INVESTMENT ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS- OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. SO WE CAN START WHAT IS CALLED A PROOF OF CONCEPT. PLANNING THROUGH THAT EFFORT AND THEN PICK ONE OR TWO DEPARTMENT AS A PILOT DEPARTMENTS TO TEST OUT THIS THEORY AND THIS APPROACH. BEFORE WE ARE POTENTIALLY COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IF THIS IS PROVING OUT TO BE BENEFICIAL. TO SKATE OUT BEFORE ANYTHING FURTHER CAN BE- CONSIDER- YOU KNOW A PRODUCTION READY- SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THIS UP FRONT- AS A REALLY THE INTENT BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL. IS NOT THAT WE ALREADY READY TO GO AND BUILD SOMETHING BUT IT'S REALLY TO START AS A PLANNING EFFORT IN ENGAGING THE STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS- BUT WITH THAT CAP BY RUSS WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD. MORE INFORMATION ON THIS. AND THAT WORLD READY FOR QUESTIONS. LAST CORRECT MA'AM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RUSTIC GOALS I THE LEAST CIO AND THE CHIEF DEPUTY COURT APARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. AND AS A NIECE OF THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU IS VERY MODEST ISSUE POSITIONS OR ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS. AS WE'VE ALL SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR WITH THE PANDEMIC THERE IS A GREATER AND GREATER NEED FOR THE DIGITECH DIGITIZATION OF STATE SERVICES WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED DIFFERENT STATE SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE DIGITAL SERVICES TO OUR RESIDENTS. RIGHT NOW EACH OF THOSE SYSTEMS IS MANAGED INDEPENDENTLY AND THAT USER IDENTIFICATION AUTHENTICATION PIECE IS MANAGED AT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE SITES SOMETIMES SEPARATE SITES WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT. BUT EACH SYSTEM DAN HAS TO MANAGE THAT INFORMATION SECURE THAT INFORMATION AND PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF OUR RESIDENTS. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING REALLY IS A PILOT TO CENTRALIZE THAT FRONT END SERVICE WHERE WE IDENTIFIED THE PERSON THIS COMING YEAR. AND PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION THAT MANAGEMENT CENTRALLY TO REDUCE THE SECURITY EXPOSURE ACTUALLY INCREASED THE PRICE OF PRIVACY FOR OUR RESIDENTS IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING THE USER EXPERIENCE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONSUMING OIL SERVICE. RIGHT NOW IF SOMEONE WANTS TO CHANGE A PIECE OF INFORMATION THEY HAVE TO REMEMBER EACH AND EVERY SITE. IN WHICH THEY'VE CREATED AN ACCOUNT AND GO BACK IN AND MODIFY THAT INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S A PHONE NUMBER OR ANYTHING ELSE. YOU HAVE A GREAT. THE GREAT SCOTT SCRIBE TO. SO WE'RE PROPOSING IS A TWO AFTER WHERE WE PLAN AND DOES AND IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY. NECESSARY TO AUTHENTICATE FOLKS TO MANAGE THAT PROCESS AND ALLOW THAT SERVICE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS IT'S SCALABLE DEPENDING ON THE SERVICES THEY NEED SO THERE ARE SYSTEMS THAT REQUIRE A VERY DEEP LEVEL. OF AUTHENTICATION TO GUARANTEE THAT A PERSON IS WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE FOR EXAMPLE ANYTHING WHERE THEY ARE ASKING FOR BENEFITS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE MIGHT BE AN EASY EXAMPLE. THERE ARE OTHER SYSTEMS THAT DON'T REQUIRE NEARLY THAT LEVEL OF AUTHENTICATION. AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS A IS THE ABILITY TO RIGHT SIZE THAT SORT OF WORK ASKING THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION FROM OUR RESIDENTS. AND WHAT'S WE PROVING THEIR IDENTITY THAT INFORMATION IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO THEM AND IN FACT. WE WILL. DESTROY THE IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION IS NO LONGER NECESSARY. FOR US FOR TO BE MAINTAINED AND ASK FOR THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE ACCOUNTS. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD WHAT WE PLAN TO DO IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT THAN A PILOT WITH TWO DEPARTMENTS AT THE END OF THAT PILOT WOULD BRING BACK AN EVALUATION OF THAT PROCESS. AND A RECOMMENDATION ON HOW TO MOVE FORWARD IN A SUBSEQUENT REQUEST BEFORE WE MOVE ANY FARTHER INTO DEPLOYMENT ACROSS THE STATE SO IT IS. A VERY IN DEPTH PLANNING PROCESS WHERE WE ABSOLUTELY PLAN TO BRING IN STAKEHOLDERS TO GATHER REQUIREMENTS GATHER THE CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. AND REPORT THOSE BACK. WITH THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THIS VERY THOROUGH EXPLANATION AND I APPRECIATE THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT IN ONE OF THE FINANCE WILL SUPPORT OF THIS CALL YOU'LL END OF THE PLANNING EFFORTS TO. LOOK INTO A BEGIN PUTTING TOGETHER A PILOT PROJECT FOR DIGITAL ID HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE. BRIAN METZGER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OF THE HEARING AGENDA AGAIN PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF OUR ANALYSIS OF THIS PROPOSAL- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS BUDGET REQUEST AS PROPOSED. AGAIN WITHOUT% PREJUDICE TO THE POLICY MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE BENEFITS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD- ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION FROM OUR ANALYSIS. CDC HAS APPROVED THE STAGE ONE BUSINESS ANALYSIS FOR THIS PROPOSED PROJECTS BUT IS REVIEWING THAT APPROVAL DOCUMENT APPROVED DOCUMENT ALONGSIDE A POTENTIAL DELEGATION REQUEST FOR THE PROJECT. SO WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THAT DOCUMENTATION AND OUR CONCLUSION- REMAINS OF THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION NEEDS TO FULLY EVALUATE THE PROPOSAL SO HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR NELSON YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- TO START OFF WHAT IS THE WHAT WHAT CRITERIA ARE YOU USING TO DETERMINE WHICH DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE PART OF THIS PILOT PRO. JECT THE INITIAL PHASE OF THIS PLANNING EFFORT IS TO DETERMINE EXACTLY THAT IN OTHER WORDS WE'VE NOT REFINED THE EXACT CRITERIA HOWEVER BECAUSE IT IS EIGHTY EIGHT PILOTING A PROOF OF CONCEPT. WE WILL NOT BE USING SYSTEMS THAT CONTAIN. A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. STRUCTURE WHERE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION OR ANYTHING EXTREMELY CONFIDENTIAL WHEN WE GET TO THE PILOT WE WANT REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEMS THAT CAN SHOW THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE DIFFERENCES ARE THAT THEY REFLECT IN CULTURAL DYNAMICS FOR. LANGUAGE OR THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES TO ENSURE THAT AN AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM COMMUNICATES WELL WITH THEM BUT WE ARE NOT PLANNING TO TAKE ON HIGH RISK EFFORTS IN THIS PILOTS WILL BE. RELATIVELY BENIGN SET OF APPLICATIONS THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE THAT WAS PART OF THAT WAS. PART OF CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED- THAT WE HAD THAT I HAD IS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OR HEALTH THE HEALTH CARE DEPARTMENT CONTAINS A LOT OF- SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND- AT MOVIES STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH IS PROBABLY GONNA BE PRETTY IMPORTANT- COMES UP FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF- ANY OF THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN THE OTHER THE OTHER CONCERNS AND THAT RAISES THE ISSUE OF WHAT NON GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. IS IT ANTICIPATED THIS THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE SHARED WITH- AT EIGHT OH. NON GOVERNMENTAL OR OUR GOVERNMENTAL PARTNERS- AGAIN BECAUSE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND- HOW WOULD YOU MITIGATE POTENTIAL SECURITY BREACHES AS PART OF THAT. PART OF THE PLAN. FROM THERE- LET ME ADDRESS THAT I THINK THEY'RE ACTUALLY TWO UNDERLYING QUESTIONS THERE. THE SECOND ONE ON THE MANAGING THE EXPOSURE TO SECURITY BREACHES BY CENTRALIZING THIS WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY MANAGING OR MONITORING THIS MUCH MORE ACTIVELY. RIGHT NOW WITH THOSE CREDENTIALS STORED IN THREE HUNDRED SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE IF ONE OF THOSE SYSTEMS IS BREACHED TO COMPARING LIKELY THOSE SAME CREDENTIALS COULD BE USED ACROSS OTHER SYSTEMS. THE ABILITY TO MONITOR THE MONITOR GOES ACROSS ALL OF THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS RIGHT NOW ALL DEPENDS ON A LOT OF INTERACTION AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS. CENTRALIZING IT ACTUALLY RAISES THE BAR ON THAT SECURITY THROUGH OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER AT THE STATE LEVEL WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETECT FOR EXAMPLE LOGGINS COMING AT EIGHTY EIGHT CASE IT IS NOT REASONABLE FOR A SINGLE PERSON TO BE ATTEMPTING WALK INS. OR FROM DISPARAGING GRAPHICAL CATIONS. I CAN'T LOG IN FROM SACRAMENTO AND THEN TWENTY MINUTES LATER BE LOGGING IN FROM. PHOENIX AND TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THAT FROM THE C. OR FROM ANOTHER CAR. WE THE CABLE WITH THIS SYSTEM TO THOSE THINGS AND MITIGATE MUCH MORE. IF WE NEED TO CLOSE THE DOOR. SO THAT THAT THE SYSTEM IS NO LONGER ACCESSIBLE BY PASCAL- WE CAN DO THAT IN ONE PLACE RATHER THAN. RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO OUT DOWN TO THREE HUNDRED DIFFERENT AREAS. ON THE- QUESTION OF INFORMATION SHARING WE WOULD COLLECT COLLECT INFORMATION TO APPROVE THE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE SYSTEMS THAT FOLKS WANT ACCESS. AT THE POINT THAT WE HAVE PROVEN THAT IDENTITY. THEN SOME OF THE INFORMATION WOULD ACTUALLY BE DELETED WE DON'T NEED TO MAINTAIN IT. ANYTHING THAT WE DO MAINTAIN WOULD BE ENCRYPTED AND WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE RESIDENTS WHO SUBMITTED THAT INFORMATION. AND WHAT ALL WOULD NOT BE SHARED BY US PROACTIVELY WAR UPON REQUEST BY ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION. OR ENTITY WITHOUT FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE FEDERAL OR STATE LAW- AND SO IF THERE IS A QUESTION FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT- THAT THAT REQUEST WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH EXISTING PROCESSES AND WE WOULD OF COURSE ABIDE BY ANY. STATUTORY OR POLICY STANCE THAT THE STATE HAS A COUPLE. VERY GOOD APPRECIATE IF I MAY ADD TO THAT ANSWER AT MANAGER JUST ONE THING I WANTED TO ALSO LEVEL STEPPED UP A CONTEXT WHERE THE INFORMATION THAT IS BEING COLLECTED THROUGH THE DIGITAL ID- IT'S YOU KNOW FROM THE DISCOVERY PROCESS IS NOT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL HUNDRED FIFTY PLUS DEPARTMENTS POTENTIALLY ALREADY COLLECTING THE CRATER USER ACCOUNT. THE DIFFERENCES IS THAT INSTEAD OF INDIVIDUAL HUNDRED FIFTY DEPARTMENTS COLLECTING THEIR INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION WE WILL BE COLLECTING THE SAME AMOUNT POSSIBLE EVEN LAST UP BUT IN A MUCH MORE STANDARDIZED FORMAT SO YOU DO IT ONCE AND THAT INDIVIDUAL WILL HAVE TO LOG IN TO THE VERY S. PUBLIC SERVICE IF THEY WANT ACCESS TO SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALSO. CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S GOING TO CREATE A NEW SETS OF INFORMATION THESE BEES COLLECTED. THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED. I PREFER I PREFER THAT. I MEAN I THAT THAT IS INDEED THERE'S NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING THAN HAVING TO GIVE THE SAME INFORMATION OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR- DIFFERENT PURPOSES BUT ALSO ALWAYS. BE IF PEOPLE SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ONE ENTITY EVEN IF. YOU'RE OPERATING OR YOUR- INTERACTING WITH DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS- TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES THE SAME INFORMATION EVERYBODY WOULD BE I THINK VERY BENEFICIAL AND- BRING US INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IT'S FOUND THE QUESTIONS ARE THE ISSUE OF SECURITY- EXACTLY WHAT THE DATA IT WILL BE USED FOR WHETHER. IT'S POSSIBLE TO MY- WHETHER THERE'S ANY INTEREST IN MONETIZING AND I WOULD THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT- BUT THOSE ARE THE KIND OF QUESTIONS I THINK THAT WE NEED TO ASK AND TO MAKE SURE. MAKE SURE IN THIS REALLY I DO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT YOU'RE NOT BUILDING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM YOU'RE TRYING TO. WORK ON. ON TRYING TO CREATE THIS SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WILL WORK FOR ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT YOU INTEND TO PUT TOGETHER AND- I DO APPRECIATE THAT- THE THOUGHT THAT'S GONE INTO THIS AND KIND OF THE M. STEP BY STEP THINKING THAT YOU USED IN IN PUTTING THIS TOGETHER RATHER THAN PROPOSING A HUGE PROJECT AND- IT IS TO TAKE IT IN BITE SIZED PIECES I REALLY APPRECIATE- I THINK THERE'S SOME SOME QUESTIONS AND MAYBE SOME MORE DISCUSSIONS TO BE HELD- HI. I THINK IT'S- PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO DO IT IT'S BACK PART OF THE PROJECT BUT THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEMS SO WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT OPEN TODAY- AND I EXPECTED TO SEE IT BACK IT AT SOME. FUTURE DATE AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S BEEN VERY VERY VERY HELPFUL THIS. THIS AFTERNOON. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FORTY SIX WHICH IS THE IN. THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. THE CONSOLIDATED HEADQUARTERS COMPLEX. AND I WANT TO INVITE THE- DEPARTMENT. TWO I GUESS IT'S GOING TO BE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT IS- PRESENTING THIS. HI MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU NUMBER SIX IS FAR. FINANCE GIVE YOU A QUICK OVERVIEW ON THE PROJECT AND WHERE IT CURRENTLY STANDS IN THE PATH FORWARD AT THE MOMENT SO MILITARIES CONSOLIDATED- HI- HAD QUARTERS COMPLEX PROJECT WAS FOUNDED IN PERFORMANCE CRITERION DESIGN BUILD FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE MILLION THE PROJECT WHICH IS ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT COMPLETE SITS ON THIRTY ACRES AROUND FOR CORDOVA NEAR THE MAJOR AIR FORCE BASE. YEP SORRY NEAR THE MAY THIRD AIRPORT THE PROPERTY WAS ACQUIRED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THE PROJECT INCLUDES THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET CONSOLIDATED HEADQUARTERS FACILITY THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT ARMORY AND A TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT STORAGE FACILITY. IN THE COMPLEX WILL CONSOLIDATE APPROX ME THOUSAND EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY WORKING OUT OF NUMEROUSLY SPACES THROUGHOUT THE SACRAMENTO AREA. THE PROJECT WHICH HAS BEEN UNDER CONSTRUCTION SINCE LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EARLY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE RECENTLY BECAME AWARE OF NUMEROUS CHALLENGES WITH A PROJECT THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME. THAT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CONSTRUCTION DELAYS. CHALLENGES HAVE INCLUDED COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND THE PROJECT'S STRAPPED IN THE CONTRACTOR. INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE R. F. P. AND THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT. IN CONCERNS WITH INSPECTION OVERSIGHT. MOST RECENTLY AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA ON MARCH NINETEENTH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL ISSUED A STOP WORK ORDER ON THE PROJECT. CITING NUMEROUS IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES THAT REMAIN AND CORRECTED. SINCE THEN ALL WORK ON THE PROJECT REMAINS SUSPENDED. IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH MILITARY ON HOW BEST TO GET THIS PROJECT BY CONTRACT. WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY AGREED THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IS TO ENGAGE THE EXPERTISE OF DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES RATHER DIDN'T CONTINUE. TO MANAGE THE PROJECT WITH MILITARY PERSONNEL ONLY. TGS IS ALREADY ASSIGNED A PROJECT DIRECTOR TO THE PROJECT ANDTHAT PROJECT DIRECTOR HAS RECENTLY WALKED THE PROJECT SITE IN ORDER TO ASSESS CONSTRUCTION STATUS. IN ADDITION DIGEST HAS PUT IN PLACE. A CONTRACT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR AND ARE WORKING ON A THIRD PARTY CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT FIRM CONTRACT TO RECONCILE THE SCHEDULE AND REVIEW AND EVALUATE OUTSTANDING CHANGE ORDERS. TGS AND MILITARY ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO RE ENGAGE WITH THE CONTRACTOR BEGINNING WITH A PARTNER IN MEETING THAT IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE TOMORROW WITH ALL PARTNERS.

NO QUESTIONS FROM. FIVE I APPRECIATE THE- THE DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT HAS BEEN CREATED BY THIS WE NEED TO GET IT BACK ON TRACK NO QUESTION ABOUT IT- THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS BEEN MADE AND- THE PROJECT NEEDS TO BE. COMPLETED THE STAFFRECOMMENDATION IS TO REJECT THE GENERAL JANUARY PROPOSAL PROVIDING POSITION AT THIRTY FOR MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL A NEW CONSOLIDATED HEADQUARTERS COMPLEX AND APPROVE THE ONETIME ARGUMENTATION OF ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION THAT REFLECTS THE ELIMINATION OF THE SAVINGS- SO WE'LL TAKE ANY ACTION- LATER ON. ON THE AGENDA BUT I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY APRECIATE- THE UPDATE ON THE PROJECT AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THINGS HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK- I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

WE'RE ALL WAITING WITH BATED BREATH TO SEE WHAT'S IN THERE MAY REVISE- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FORTY SEVEN- WHICH IS- IT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND DEVELOPMENT- GO BIZ. AND IT IS SUPPORT FOR UNDERSERVED FINANCIAL MARKETS. WHEN ASKED THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST TO PLEASE PRESENT ON THIS ITEM. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM BRAND WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I WILL BE INTRODUCING THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE- COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE FIRST ITEM IN THIS PACKAGE IS ISSUE NUMBER FORTY SEVEN. SO THIS IS THE SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PLAN TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR UNDERSERVED FINANCIAL MARKETS. AS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA THIS ITEM HAS TWO COMPONENTS. THE FIRST COMPONENT WOULD PROVIDE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME TO FIND A NEW GRANT PROGRAM. TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR CDFI IS. CITY OF FIZER PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED BY TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. AS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA THE SENATE PLAN WOULD CREATE A NEW COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM CALLED THE CALIFORNIA INVESTMENTS AND INNOVATION PROGRAM WHICH WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANKER I THINK. UNDER THIS NEW PROGRAM SIGNIFIES REPLY TO I THANK FOR GRANTS GRANT FUNDING WOULD- MIGHT BE USED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF USES FOR EXAMPLE TO MAKE LOANS TO MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE GRANTS OULD ALSO BE USED TO FUND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OPERATED BY THE CITY OF FIGHTS. AND THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS- ITEM WOULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME TO THE FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT FUND WHICH IS USED TO MAKE GRANTS TO NONPROFITS SERVING UNBANKED AND UNDERBANKED CALIFORNIANS. THIS PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. GRANTS MADE UNDER THIS PROGRAM CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE FREE FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND OTHER SERVICES. I AM SOMEWHAT LIMITED IN MY ABILITY TO PROVIDE. COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL THAT SAID I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY MY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT TIME I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM. ONE OF OUR PANELISTS SIR ARE. RIGHT ROSE ABI. THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS SARAH RESOLVING I AM THE CEO OF WORKING SOLUTIONS CDFI. WE'RE A NONPROFIT CDFI BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO SERVING THE LARGER NINE BAY AREA REGION OUR ORGANIZATION PROVIDE START UP AND EARLY STAGE MICROLOANS COUPLED WITH CONSULTING AT SMALL BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURS. AS MISSION DRIVEN LENDERS WE SERVE THOSE WHO ARE MARGINALIZED BY THE FINANCIAL MAINSTREAM ESPECIALLY LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS WOMEN AND ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR. BUT I'M HERE TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR COMMUNITY INVESTMENT A COALITION OF MORE THAN THIRTY CALIFORNIA CDS SIZE OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND WITH DIFFERENT PRODUCTS RANGING FROM SMALL BUSINESS LENDING REAL ESTATE AND MORE BUT WHAT ALIGNS US IS A COMMITMENT TO BRINGING EQUITABLE INVESTMENT TO UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES AND WORKING TO OVERCOME. HISTORIC PATTERNS OF DISINVESTMENT. I AM PLEASED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. AS A CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA NAVIGATES ITS WAY OUT OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE LEVERAGE THE STATE'S UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET SURPLUS TO BUILD A JUST AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND TO BUILD THE PERMANENT INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUSTAIN THE RECOVERY. AND EXPAND OPPORTUNITY. THE CDFI MODEL I CAPITAL OVER OF. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE TO BE LEVERAGED FOR THE BENEFIT OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE LACKED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE INVESTMENT. CALIFORNIA MAY USE THAT SURPLUS NOT ONLY FOR ONE TIME INVESTMENTS BUT TO CREATE THE LONG TERM INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT REAL CHANGE IN COMMUNITIES THAT WERE STRUGGLING BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CATCH AND TO MAYBE LEFT FARTHER BEHIND IF WE DO NOT ACT IN COORDINATION. THAT MEANS SUPPORTING THE MERRY OUT OF INVESTMENT CDFI COLLECTIVELY. INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS DELIVERED DELIVERING HOUSING HEALTH CARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALSO BUILDING FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR FAMILIES. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS A MODEST INVESTMENT IN A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIA INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION PROGRAM. WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A CDFI FUND IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD LEVERAGE THE RESOURCES AND INNOVATION OF CALIFORNIA'S CDFI IS TO BRING CRITICAL INVESTMENT TO COMMUNITIES IN NEED. THIS PROGRAM AS OUTLINED IN THE CHAIR IS SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY FIVE WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO SUPPORT. THE PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY MODELED AFTER THAT VERY SUCCESSFUL FEDERAL CDFI FUND PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE US TREASURY DEPARTMENT. CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED FLEXIBLE CAPITAL TO CALIFORNIA SIGNIFIES TO MAKE LOANS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS CONSUMERS AND EVEN COMMUNITIES ADDRESSING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS SUCH AS SAFE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. THE INVESTMENT PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET ITEM WOULD BE LEVERAGED AT THREE TO ONE MEANING THAT CDFI IS COULD USE EVERY DOLLAR THE STATE INVEST TO DELIVER THREE DOLLARS FOR CRITICAL COMMUNITY PROJECTS. IN ADDITION THIS BUDGET ITEM WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT FUND A PROGRAM CREATED BY SENATOR BRADFORD'S SP FOUR FIFTY FIVE OF TWENTY NINETEEN. THE FUND SAYS UNBANKED AND UNDERBANKED CONSUMERS ACCESS RESPONSIBLE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS BUILD CREDIT AND ACCESS FREE FINANCIAL EDUCATION. WE APPRECIATE THE BUDGETS ARE STATEMENTS OF OUR VALUES AND TOGETHER THESE TWO MODEST INVESTMENTS WILL HELP DEVELOP A CHEST AND STENA BULK ECONOMIC RECOVERY BY DELIVERING LONG TERM RESOURCES TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA CDFI INDUSTRY. OTHER STATES INCLUDING NEW YORK AND VIRGINIA HAVE ALREADY INSTITUTED STATES CDFI FINES AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A SIMILAR STEP. WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THESE CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THE STATE'S BUDGET AND AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. SENATOR NELSON YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR PRESENTATION SERVER RED SOX RAYS ABI- IN THE- EIGHT THE ABILITY. TO LEVERAGE. PRECIOUS STATE RESOURCES WHICH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND PARTICULARLY IN THESE AREAS- AROUND HOUSING HEALTH CARE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK ALL OF THAT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF UNBANKED AND UNDERBANKED INDIVIDUALS IS- IS LONG STANDING AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE. A CREDIT IF YOU DON'T DO IT IN OUR SYSTEM IS- IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU IN ORDER TO HAVE GOOD CREDIT YOU HAVE TO BORROW. WHICH DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE YOU COULD PAY ALL YOUR BILLS IN CASH ON TIME AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CREDIT AND SO THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY GET OUT AND TEACH PEOPLE HOW THAT ALL WORKS AND THEN THE- RESPONSIBILITY OF MAKING REGULAR PAYMENTS IN ORDER TO GET GOOD CREDIT. THAT THEN ALLOWS YOU TO GET THE LOWER- WERE AT. LOWER INTEREST RATES AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT COMES UP THAT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND HOW YOU CAN LOSE CREDIT JUST BY CO SIGNING. ALL OF THAT IS- IT'S FAIRLY INTERPRET INTRICATE AND IS- IT IS NOT. LOGICAL SYSTEM IS NOT BASED ON LOGIC WHICH IS THAT IF I PAY ALL MY BILLS ON TIME THAT I SHOULD HAVE REALLY GOOD CREDIT- SO IN PARTICULAR IMMIGRANTS COMING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. THAT HAVE THE- A DIFFERENT SYSTEM FIND IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO. MANAGE I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND- AND THE KINDS OF RESOURCES THAT THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR. EXPENDITURE WOULD PROVIDE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU THANK YOU YES THE CDS I INDUSTRY IS WELL AWARE OF THE COMMUNITIES YOU'RE REFERRING TO SENATOR AND- I THINK IT'S IT GOES TO STATE THAT TRANSLITERATED TO CEOS OF MAJOR BANKS CHARLIE SCHARF AND OF WELLS FARGO. AND BUILT IN CHECK OF PNC SENT THAT SIGNIFIES ARE ONE OF THE KEY INVESTMENT APPROACHES THEY ARE USING TO COMBAT RACIAL INEQUITY AND RESTORE THE ECONOMY. SO THAT SPEAKS TO THE POINT AROUND LEVERAGE- WE REALLY ARE WELL POISED TO WORK WITH BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. SUPPORT TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY UNDER BANKED AND UNDER RESOURCE- ARE LIFTED UP. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT APPRECIATE IT AND IF WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE A DENT IN. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT. CAN SOMEDAY BUY A HOME THIS IS GOING TO BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. AS WE ROLL OUT OUR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS PROGRAM THAT WE ALSO HAVE THIS ALONGSIDE IT. TO HELP THE WHOLE PROCESS WORK A LOT BETTER SO THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM- WE'LL SEE THIS BACK IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FORTY EIGHT WHICH IS MICROBICIDES. RELIEF FUND. AND IF I COULD- ASK. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- BRAIN WITH WEATHERFORD AGAIN TO- THIS ITEM. YES ISSUE NUMBER FORTY EIGHT IS THE SENATE'S BUDGET PLAN TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE'S SMALLEST BUSINESS. THE FEDERAL PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM AND CALIFORNIA'S COVED NINETEEN RELIEF GRANTS HAVE PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE COBIT NINETEEN TEN DEMOCRATS. HOWEVER. IN THESE FUNDS AS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA THE SENATE'S BUDGET PLAN INCLUDES FUNDING FOR A NEW STATEWIDE MICRO BUSINESS RELIEF FUND THIS NEW PROGRAM COULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO SIDEWALK VENDORS AND OTHER INFORMAL BUSINESSES THAT ALSO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD WOULD NOW LIKE TO TURN THE MIKE OVER TO RUDY ESPINOZA WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INCLUSIVE ACTION FOR THE CITY.

I'M I'M HERE TODAY TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING MICRO BUSINESSES IN INFORMAL ENTREPRENEURS WITH THE CREATION OF THIS DEDICATED GRANT PROGRAM. THERE'S SO MUCH NEED IN CALIFORNIA THIS COULD REALLY HELP. FOR OVERTEN YEARS MY ORGANIZATION AND MANY OTHERS HAVE WORKED TO CREATE PATHWAYS FOR MICRO ENTREPRENEURS WHO OPERATE BUSINESSES IN THE OPEN AIR ECONOMY THE SELF CREW TALK WAS QUOTING A CULTURAL GOODS AND OTHER ITEMS TO TEACHER THEIR FAMILIES. IN LA WE SEE THAT MANY OF THE STREET VENDORS THAT WE WORK WITH ARE WOMEN IN THE MAJORITY ARE REALLY LOW INCOME BUT DESPITE THEIR INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGES AS A COMMUNITY OF MICROCHIP OR NOR IS THE GENERATOR OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN LA ALONE. I MEAN I'M SURE THEY ADDED THAT NUMBERS A LOT BIGGER WHEN WE WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COMMUNITIES AND CITIES AND TOWNS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. UNFORTUNATELY INFORMAL BUSINESSES LIKE STREET VENDORS AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN REALLY BAD IN IT HARD AND IT MAKES NO SURPRISE THERE ARE THESE CLASSES SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WERE LEADING ONE CRISIS AWAY FROM LOSING THEIR HOUSE SCENE AND POINTED TO SEE IF YOUR DAD BEFORE THIS AND THAT MAKES. AND NOW THE CRISIS HAS COME IN THE CRISIS LASTED OVER A YEAR AND MANY. HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING. AS A RESULT OF THE EMERGENCY HEALTH ORDERS THAT THEY TOOK PLACE IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ACROSS THE STREET MANY WORK VAN FROM SELLING. OTHER AS YOU KNOW SENATE BILL NYE FORTY SO CREATED A FRAMEWORK FOR CITIES TO CREATE. THIS FOR SIDE VENDOR. BUT THE PANDEMIC IN THESE EMERGE.

AND YOU KNOW THE MONEY WE BELIEVE CAN HELP ENTREPRENEURS CATER DEBTS BUT ALSO ACQUIRE PERMITS IN NEW EQUIPMENT SO THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE ECONOMY. WE JUST WE CAN'T HAVE A CHEST RECOVERY WITHOUT THE MICRON SUPPORTERS IMMIGRANT NEIGHBORHOODS VIBRANT. AND IN- WE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER REALLY SUPPORTING THIS- FOR ME THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE WOULD ADMINISTER THESE RESOURCES. I THINK THE CDFI IS CONCERNED WE HELP ADMINISTER THESE RESOURCE. BUT ALSO OTHER COMMUNITY BASED. EACH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND- THIS IS EXCITING. IT'S AN EXCITING POTENTIAL HERE. SO THAT'S IT- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE MANY COMPETING PRIORITIES BUT I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT IF YOU DO NOT. SURE THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY MICROCHIPPING NORRIS WERE CREATING THEIR OWN JOBS. IN OUR ECONOMY CAN BE AS STRONG AS IT CAN BE. YOU KNOW AND SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER THIS SERIOUSLY THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'M HERE FOR YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM LUKE PARDEW WHOSE THE ECONOMIST. AT COASTAL. I. THANK YOU ARE CHECK OUT THE ERROR AND- SUBCOMMITTEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY MY NAME IS LUKE PARTY- I AM AN ECONOMIST AT GUSTO RESEARCHING HOW SMALL BUSINESSES CAN BE BOLSTERED BY PUBLIC POLICIES GUSTO IS A CAMPUS THE SCHOOL BASED PEOPLE. PLATFORM EIGHT FIVE PROVIDES. BENEFITS COME AND X. EXPERT HR MORE THAN FIVE SMALL. AND HELP MORE THAN A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE THIS MISSION IS TO CREATE A WORLD WHERE WORK EMPOWERS A BETTER LIFE AND WE ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO HELPING LAUNCH. NORTH CANTON POLICE ARRIVE. OUR GOAL IS TO AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF SMALL BUSINESSES. AND TO ADVOCATE. FOR HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. I WANTED TO PROVIDE TODAY SOME DATABASE INSIGHTS ON THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PROPOSED BUDGET PRIORITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF. NAMELY THE SPORT FOR THE CDFI FUNDING TO RECAPITALIZE THESE INSTITUTIONS. AND SUPPORT FOR THE MICRO BUSINESS RELIEF FUND WHICH WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS TO THE SMALLEST BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING. FOR THAT R. TWO RESOURCE CONSTRAINED TO PURSUE ANY AND ALL SOURCES OF EIGHT- SELECTIVE YOU WITH. SOME REAL TIME DATA FROM GUSTO THAT UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR THESE POLICIES AND I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME EMERGING DISPARITIES THAT REINFORCED THE IMPORTANCE OF ALLOCATING RESPONSE EQUITABLY. ACROSS THE STATE PARTICULARLY TO THOSE I HARD HIT INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA. THESE INSIGHTS COME FROM CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES USING US THOSE PAYROLL SOFTWARE WHICH INCLUDES FIRMS ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES FROM RESTAURANTS AND RETAIL SHOPS TO DOCTORS OFFICES IN CHILD CARE CENTERS. MORE THAN THAN FIFTEEN EMPLOYEES SO THE STATE CAN BE SEEN AS A SNAPSHOT OF. THE STATE OF MICRO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. THROUGH APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS PAST MONTH MICRO BUSINESSES IN THESE HARD HIT INDUSTRIES WHICH INCLUDE PERSONAL SERVICES. MAJOR IN HOSPITALITY. STILL STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE OR COMPLAINANT DOWN TWENTY TWENTY RIGHT BEFORE THE END OF A CAT. LOOKING AT A FEW SECTORS IN PARTICULAR MICRO BUSINESSES BEING A TOURISM INDUSTRY A VITAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY I HAVE YET TO RECOVER ONE THIRD OF THEIR PRE CAN'T MAKE HEAD COUNT. CHECK BEEN SIMILARLY HARD HIT. AND SALONS AND ARE STILL DOWN TWENTY. SECOND EVEN WITHIN THIS GROUP OF MICRO BUSINESSES ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THERE ARE LARGE DISPARITIES ACROSS FIRM SIZES. MOST NOTABLY FIRMS IN CALIFORNIA WITH FEWER THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES. HAVE CONTINUED TO SHED JOBS EVEN AS LARGER BUSINESSES AFTER A PERIOD OF GROWTH AND RECOVERY. FINALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME ALARMING DISPARITIES ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS COMBINING DUSTED EMPLOYMENT DTA WITH DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON CALIFORNIA'S COUNTIES WE SEE THAT EMPLOYMENT UP SMALL BUSINESSES BEEN MAJORITY BY PARK COUNTY APPLE INC THREE TIMES MORE ACCOUNTS IN THE REST OF THE STATE. AND EMPLOYMENT IN COUNTIES WITH ABOVE AVERAGE SHARES OF. HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE LIVING IN SPEAKING OUR HOUSE. ARE DOWN FOR TIMES THAN THE REST F THE STATE. PUTTING THIS ONE TOGETHER WAS IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR A- TO THESE MICROBES. AND FOR THE X. RAYS TO BE PART TO THOSE HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND BY LARGER. SUCH AS THE COULD CHECK GROUP. THE SMALLEST OF THE SMALL BIT ARE STILL TO I'M OUR PARTICULAR STRUGGLING SECTORS SUCH THAT WERE HARDEST HIT. AND OUR COMMUNITY. CONTINUE TO BE HARDSHIP HI THIS RECESSION. A FEW SUGGESTIONS FOR THIS MICRO GRANTS PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF WITH TO MAKE IS ELIGIBLE RIGHT ARE STILL AS FAR. TO ALLOW AS MANY FORMS OF THE- AS POSSIBLE AND TO ENSURE. THAT APPLICATIONS ARE IN LINE WITH OTHER ENGLISH LIKE HER ARE A NOW. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT GET DATA UP TO. G. AREAS THAT INDUSTRIES. WHEN USED TOGETHER PUBLIC PRIVATE DATA SOURCES CAN PROVIDE A REAL TIME POLLS ON ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND HIS FINDINGS CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO FORMULAS ALLOCATE THESE WERE RESPONSE. HERE AS AN EXAMPLE WHY WOULD I HAVE BEEN USING TOURISM BOTH HAVE FUN SET ASIDE FOR DIRECTED RECOVERY EFFORTS. OUR DATA SHOWS THAT SALONS AND SPAS HAVE BEEN JUST AS HARD HIT AND HAVE BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED. IN TARGETED IT AFTERWARDS RECEIVE CLA OUR SYSTEM OF SALON WORKERS ARE NEARLY 76% ASIAN 80% EMAIL SO THIS IS A MATTER OF GENDER. EQUITY GENDER AND RACIAL EQUITY IN ADDITION. TO BEING GOOD ECONOMIC SENSE. THESE POLICIES. THAT PROVIDE TARGET A TWO BY PRO BUSINESS. OUR CREW STEPS TO BUILDING AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY IS A GOOD OF ALL HEALTH. AND I HOPE THAT'S THE BETTER CAN I INFORM EFFORTS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO AND I'VE GOT TO TAKE A QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TEST. OF THE SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF MAKING THAT PROGRAM STRONGER MY CFI THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS ANY COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM. I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU ON THE LAST MY APOLOGIES. HELLO TO PARK TOMORROW JOHNSON DEPARTMENT FINANCE WE HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OKAY VERY GOOD HOW ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. VERY GOOD BRING IT BACK TO- QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. BUT WE ARE WE'RE ON THE MICRO BUSINESS S. R. SENATOR NELSON LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION. MADAM CHAIRMAN. IT IS NOT A JUVENILE. QUESTION FOR THESE DAYS AND TIMES WHAT IS DEFINED AS STATUTORILY OR LEGALLY AS A QUOTE MICRO BUSINESS. GOOD QUESTION I THINK WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT IDEAS OF WHAT IT ENTAILS BASED ON A- BASED ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SO MAYBE I COULD ASK- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO ONE COMMON DEFINITION OF A MICRO BUSINESSES IF YOU WERE THAN TEN EMPLOYEES I BELIEVE THAT- HAS BEEN USED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION- BUT I'M NOT SURE- THAT DID THAT YOU MENTIONED- CHECKUP THERE THERE'S MORE THAN ONE DEFINITION OF A MICRO BUSINESS. WELL I THINK. WHERE IS THAT DOWN IS THAT IN THE CODE BOOK IS THAT IN A MEMO BOOK IS IT IN A STORYBOOK EIGHT IS IT IN A REGULATION THERE'S A RUSH STATUTORY FOUNDATION FOR A MICRO BUSINESS. WHAT'S THE LEGAL FOUNDATION. FORTIETH. IF THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE CAN- I'M NOT AWARE OF A STATUTORY DEFINITION OF A MICRO BUSINESS BUT WE CAN- LOOK INTO THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF WELL YES WE'RE TALKING ALL ABOUT DOING THINGS FOR MICRO BUSINESSES BUT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT OR WHO WE'RE DOING THINGS FOR. THAT'S NOT A VERY GOOD WAY TO PROCEED SO PLEASE IF YOU'D BE SO KIND. WE'LL GET TO THAT DEFINITION SENATOR I THINK- S. EIGHT YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT- WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR SMALL BUSINESS GRANT. PROGRAM THAT WE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. TRYING TO REACH DEEPER INTO THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR. AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF- OF THAT SMALL BUSINESSES AND I THINK THE ONE OF THE TESTIMONY- WHAT IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN BUSINESSES BETTER- BETTER HOME BUSINESSES SO THEY COOK AT HOME AND THEN THEY SELL OUT OF THE BACK OF A TRUCK OR THE ID CODE YOU KNOW TO BUSINESSES- THE TAMALE LADY COMES TO MIND TO MIND BUT ALSO- THERE ARE ALL OF THE VENDORS THAT THAT SELL FRUIT OUT OF THE BACK OF A TRUCK. THEY SELL ICE CREAM BE IT WITH THE LITTLE CARDS THAT ARE INDIVIDUAL PARTS MAYBE EVEN THE ICE CREAM AND WEAR THEIR- THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR OWN BUSINESS- AND THEY DON'T HAVE. A THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO- THINK CORP INCORPORATOR TO BE YOU KNOW FOLLOW THE KINDS OF A BUSINESS PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE. THEY'RE MICRO IF YOU WILL- WHAT WE WANT TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE STOPPED OPERATING ENTIRELY- IT'S ALSO THE TACO TRUCKS MEET IT AS WELL- THEN THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM WHERE THEY THEY COULD ALSO ACCESS GRANT FUNDS- WE DID NOT INCLUDE THEM IN THE- IN THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE WE JUST COULDN'T- FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE ABLE TO REACH THAT FAR INTO THE- INTO THE SMALL BUSINESS- AT. AT AREA AND SO THIS I THINK IS THE RESPONSE TO THAT BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES A MICRO BUSINESS- AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT IF YOU WERE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE OTHER PROGRAM YOU WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS PROGRAM- BUT- THIS IS. AN ITEM THAT IS A I BELIEVE IT'S A- HOLD OPEN ITEM SO IT MORE ON THAT LATER. BUT THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE HAD A SMALL BUSINESS IF THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT. A LOCATION READ THAT THEY'RE PAYING AND STAFF THAT THEY'RE PAYING AND SO THIS IS THE ATTEMPT TO REACH THEM SO WE HEAR YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN I THINK WE THIS IS A SENATE PROPOSAL- WE LEFT SOME PEOPLE OUT OF THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM AND WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE CAPTURING THEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR BUT I THINK IN TIME TERMS OF THE TACO TRACTION GESTURE. THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT. DEFINITELY THERE. AND YOU KNOW IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT I THINK THE TESTIMONY FROM- LA WAS THAT IT'S A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION TO THEIR LOCAL ECONOMY. IT SAYS IT SAYS THAT SIGNIFICANT AERO CALIFORNIA. THOSE ARE THE THAT USUALLY THEY'RE THAT THE- BUSINESSES THAT GROW OVER TIME AND THAT. THEN END UP. RENTING A LOCATION AND SERVING. SERVING MEALS AND- AND OTHER ACTIVITIES SO- WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE CAPTURING THEM SO I'M- I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS I'M I THINK THIS IS A- A REALLY GOOD IDEA AND I. I DO THINK THERE'S MORE MORE INFORMATION COMING SO. I THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT QUESTION SENATOR- THAT CONCLUDES THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FORTY NINE. WHICH IS LIVE EVENTS GRANTS AND ARTS AND CULTURE INVESTMENT. AND DONNA LET ME SEE HERE WE'LL GO FIRST TO. BRIAN WEATHERFORD FROM THE- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HELLO AGAIN- FRIEND WHETHER FORD LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ISSUE NUMBER FORTY NINE IS THE SENATE'S BUDGET PLAN TO CREATE A NEW GRANT PROGRAM FOR LIFE EVENT VENUES PERFORMING ARTS VENUES AND RELATED. BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I SHOULD SAY RELATED BUSINESSES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS- AS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA THIS LIVE VENUES GRANT PROGRAM WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE NON PROFIT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS COMPONENT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM. IS ADMINISTERED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ELIGIBLE BUSINESSES COULD INCLUDE ENTITIES WHOSE PRIMARY BUSINESS ACTIVITY. IS ORGANIZING OR HOSTING LIVE EVENTS OR WHO ARE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO SIGNIFY THE END WHO ARE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE LOSS DURING THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF TWENTY TWENTY AS COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN. THE LIVE VENUES GRANT PROGRAM IS ONE PART OF A LARGER ONE BILLION DOLLARS SENATE PLAN TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE'S CREATIVE INDUSTRIES.

THESE ORGANIZATIONS EMPLOY OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND EARN MORE THAN SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE EACH YEAR. FUNDING THESE ORGANIZATIONS MEANS JOB RECOVERY AND CREATION. ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS JUST FOR CREATIVE WORKERS IN THE FIRST PROJECTS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PUBLIC ARTWORKS MUSICAL AND THEATRICAL PERFORMANCES. COMMUNITY DOCUMENTATION PROJECTS THAT LIFT UP THE VOICES OF THE SYSTEMICALLY MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS AND THAT RE FRAME AND RE IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES. OF FINDING A NEW CALIFORNIA CULTURE AND PROVIDE TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO NEW CREATIVE WORKERS WITH EARN AND LEARN LIVING WAGE OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS PROPOSED IN SENATOR ALLEN'S BILL CALIFORNIA CREATED WORK FOR SAC. SH SEE THIS IS THE RIGHT MECHANISM AS IT. IS A LONG ESTABLISHED COMPETITIVE STATEWIDE GRANTS THE PROCESS WITH THE RE IT STRICT CAMPUS ON RAY ACT. AND FUNDING TO UNDER REESE CONTROL MARK. COMMUNITIES WE FOR SOME FROM USING AND CULTURE CITY. WITH TWO HUNDRED MILLION- TO CAL CULTURAL AND HIS. DOWN IT RECEIVE H. E. STATE ROUTE THAT IS. SO TWO AND THREE IS CURRENTLY HOUSED IN. RE AND- FUNDING FROM HIGHER BOND IS DRIED UP AND ONLY ABOUT HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR BEING. FROM THE C. T. LYSONS PLATE CREATED BY PROTON. LEGISLATION TWENTY THIRTEEN. THEY NEED A STRONG PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS STAGGERINGLY AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. FUNDING CCH US ONE TIME DOLLARS IS CRITICAL AND A TRANSPARENT WAY TO DISTRIBUTE SUPPORT. MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE STATE FROM ITS INCEPTION CCG HAS ALWAYS PRIORITIZED FUNDING PROJECTS THAT UPLIFT UNDERREPRESENTED STORIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. LEGISLATURES A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S CREATIVE INDUSTRIES ECOSYSTEM. AND WE HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS ITEM THANK YOU IN A BILLABLE TO AND ANSWER ANY. QUESTIONS REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVING ONTO CASE LETTERMAN. YES A CHECK OF A AND MEMBERS OF THE STOCK THANK YOU FOR THE R. TO TEST HERE TO. MY NAME IS KEITH AMONG CO FOUNDER OF TE CAL CHECK OF THE AND BUT SERVICE. READ OVER HUNDRED INDEPENDENT VENUES AND PROMOTERS IN CALIFORNIA THESE VENUES ARE ANCHOR TENANTS IN YOUR DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OUR VENUES WERE THE FIRST TO CLOSE AND WILL BE THE LAST OF FULLY REOPENED AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO OUTLINE THE IMPORTANCE OR POST GRAD PROGRAM. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE MY COLLEAGUE JULIE BAKER WITH CALIFORNIA ARTS ADVOCATES FOR HER ADVOCACY IN PARTNERSHIP. THE FEDERAL SHUTTERS VENUE OPERATOR GRANT PROGRAM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LIFELINE FOR PROFIT AND NONPROFIT INDEPENDENT VENUES THAT ARE NOT MULTINATIONAL. OR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. I WAS PASSED AT THE OF DECEMBER BUT WELL DONE. SO INTO. DIFFICULTY APPLICATION DID NOT UNTIL APRIL SIX. AND STILL NOT A DIME HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED. ALL THE WHILE VENUES ARE LOSING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TO REMAIN CLOSED. WE HAVE ALL THE OVERHEAD COSTS AND ZERO REVENUE GOING ON FOURTEEN MONTHS. EVERY DAY WITHOUT THE FEDERAL RELIEF INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT BEEN USED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO SHUTTER. WHICH IS WHY WE ARE ASKING CALIFORNIA TO STEP IN AS SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY DONE SO. TO PREVENT THIS CULTURAL EXTINCTION AND ALSO MAKE SURE THESE VENUES ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE WORKING CAPITAL TO REOPEN. REHIRE AND RESUME AS ANCHOR TENANTS IN MAJOR ECONOMIC DRIVERS OF LOCAL AND STATE REVENUE. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHEN IT IS SAFE TO DO USED TO DO SO. JENNY'S GENERATE AN ESTIMATE THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT TO THE STATE IS HIGH WITH THE RECENT ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY FINDING THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT AT A VENUE. TWELVE DOLLARS ARE GENERATED IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY AT RESTAURANTS BARS LODGING RETAIL SHOPS AND TRANSPORTATION. IN ADDITION VENUES EMPLOYED OVER FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FULL TIME JOBS INCLUDING BARTENDERS JANITORIAL SECURITY FACILITY MAINTENANCE PRODUCTION VENDORS AND MORE. THE GOAL OF OUR STATE BUDGET REQUEST IS TO TRAIN WORKING CAPITAL THREE OPEN IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF SHUTTING DOWN FOR OVER A YEAR. ADDRESSING NEW CODED PROTOCOLS AND REHIRING AND RETRAINING OUR STAFF. THE FEDERAL S. YOUR G. PROGRAM ADDRESSES THE COLD STORAGE OF DEBT THAT VENUES HAVE RACKED UP SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. AND WE'RE ASKING CALIFORNIA TO HELP US GOING FORWARD. OUR EMPLOYEE RETENTION IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT ONE THIRD COMING OUT OF THIS KIND OF MAKE. THE REMAINING TWO THIRDS WILL BE JOB CREATION IN REPLACEMENT. MEANING AN ESTIMATED TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND NEW HIRES IN A REAL PAIN PROCESS. EVEN IF VENUES WERE ABLE TO OPEN TOMORROW WE WOULD NOT SEE REVENUE FOR MANY MORE MONTHS IS BOOKING TALENT DEPENDS ON A NATIONAL TOURING ECOSYSTEM. RELY ON EVERY STATE BEING OPEN. ONE STYLE IS BOOKED IT TAKES THREE TO SIX MONTHS TO MARKET THE SHOW SELL TICKETS HIGHER STATS AND PRODUCED A CONCERT. HALL CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF MEASURES TO DATE WERE APPRECIATED. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANTS CANNOT STEM THE LOSSES FOR A MAJORITY OF VENUES. AND THE STATE PROGRAM OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS IS LIMITED TO NON PROFITS. THAT'S A LIMITING ELIGIBILITY FOR THE WHITE MAJORITY. OF VENUES AND PROMOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. PLEASE ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE I DON'T THE CREW NEED TO. IN VENUES DURING THE SPEND I CAN READ- AND FOR EXAMPLE. IT'S MILLION DOLLAR PER AND THEN IN ALLOCATION THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED VENUES. THESE GREAT AMOUNTS PER INCH TV IN OTHER STATE PROPOSALS ARE IN LINE OR GREATER THAN WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING FOR CALIFORNIA. OF ALL THE STATES CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST VENUES AND THE MOST JOBS AT STAKE. CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONLY THE BURST BIRTHPLACE OF THE MODERN CONCERT INDUSTRY BUT ALSO HAS SOME OF THE MOST ICONIC INDEPENDENT VENUES IN THE COUNTRY. WELL ON THE WORLD RECOGNIZING THEIR VALUE TO THE STATE'S ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL IMPACT WITH THE STIMULUS GRANT PROGRAM WOULD BE A STATEMENT FOR COMMUNITIES AND THE REST OF THE NATION. IN CLOSING I WANT TO REFER TO AN ARTICLE IN VARIETY THAT WAS PUBLISHED LAST WEEK. THE ARTICLE EXPLAINED HOW TO PROLONG DELAYS OF OUR LIFELINE IN THE S. B. O. G. PROGRAM WE'RE SENSUALLY EXACERBATING THE CREATION OF A MORE OF A MONOPOLY IN THE LIVE MUSIC AND PERFORMANCE INDUSTRY. INDEPENDENTLY OWNED VENUES SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA I'VE HAD TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS WITH ZERO SUPPORT WHILE LARGER ENTITIES ARE ABLE TO WITHSTAND WITHSTAND ECONOMIC IMPACT WITH SHAREHOLDERS. TELEVISION BROADCAST AND SPONSORSHIP FUNDING. LASTLY THE NET OF INDEPENDENT VENUES IS BROAD JUST ASK THE RESTAURANT OWNER WHO WILL TELL YOU HOW HE STARTED HIS BUSINESS NEAR VENUE DUE TO THE CONSISTENT DRIVE CUSTOMERS. WHO NOW FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE WITH THE VENUE SHUTTERED AND CROWDS OF PEOPLE DIMINISHED OR ASK THE ARTISTS TOMORROW'S RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS ARE TRUE FIGHTERS. NO LONGER HAVE THE STAGE TO PERFORM AT TO REFINE THEIR CRAFT OR TO GROW THEIR AUDIENCE. THESE VENUES ARE CRITICAL PIECES OF CALIFORNIA'S CULTURE AND ECONOMY AND WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND I AM AVAILABLE AS WELL TRANSGRESSIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY GOING TO SEE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS ANY COMMENT. JOHNSON DEPARTMENT FINANCE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THIS IS A BILLION DOLLARS. IT LOOKS LIKE IT FLOWS THROUGH THEN EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE COMMUNITY ACCESS TO ARCH. AND THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE I GATHER SOMEONE ASKED ME SPECIFICALLY BUT THE THROUGH THE ARTS COUNCIL FOR THEIR DIFFERENT SPELLING THAT DOUBLING UP THOSE GRAPHS. END OF THE WORKFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT FUNDING AND MEASUREMENTS AND CULTURAL INSTITUTION TO SET THE REALM OF. ENTITIES FOR THE MONEY WILL FLOW. US SENATOR NELSON THIS IS JULIE BAKER YES- AT THEIR COMMUNITY ACCESS TO THE ARTS PROPOSAL WOULD BE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL OVER THE NEXT TWO TO FOUR YEARS INVESTMENTS SO THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS CAN ALSO BUILD BACK ORGANIZATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY. AND THEY GET CREATIVE WORKFORCE ACT RIGHT NOW ALSO IS LOOKING TO GO THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL WITH- THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IN COLLABORATION AND THEN THE MUSICIANS WOULD GO THROUGH- C. C. H. E. UNDER THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WHICH HAS NOT. BEEN OUT OF FOR AN AGENCY THAT HAS JUST BEEN. UNDER FUNDED FOR MANY MANY YEARS. THAT'S QUITE A QUITE A NUMBER FOR THE OUT CAN FOR YOU THEY WHOLE BY WAS ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT THAT THIS IS- IT'LL BE A BIG. BOOST I SEE MERIT IN IT THAT WE WILL NEED TO TAKE A TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT. THANK IT'S A POINT WELL TAKEN. SENATOR I THINK I HAVE THAT. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I LIKE THIS PROPOSAL- THE QUESTION IS ONE OF CAPACITY AND MARKET CAPACITY IN TERMS OF- THE ABILITY TO MOVE MONEY OUT AND MAKE SURE IT'S- EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE- THROUGHOUT THE- THE STATE AND- A LONG BEEN CONCERNED THAT. A LOT OF THE TIMES THE ARTS MONEY TENDS TO GO TOWARDS COMMUNITIES- THAT HAVE THE ECONOMIC RESOURCES TO- TO FIND LOCAL PROGRAMS AND IT DOESN'T GO TO THOSE COMMUNITIES MANY OF WHOM I REPRESENT THAT BOMBS. WERE EQUITY IS A BIG ISSUE SO I- THIS IS A HOLD UP AN ITEM I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- I APPRECIATE THAT. THE- THE NEED AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE ECONOMIC. INVESTMENT THIS WOULD BE A NO QUESTION ABOUT THE FACT THAT- BUT IT'S- THAT WE NEED TO GET THE- CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS- OPEN AND OPERATING AGAIN IN ORDER FOR US TO- TO REALLY STIMULATE THE ECONOMY I THINK PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS FOR THIS KIND OF RIGHT THEY THEY'RE ANXIOUS FOR THEM TO OPEN AND SO ANYWAY WE CAN HELP WITH IT WOULD BE GOOD. BUT I ALSO SHARE THE CONCERNS THE CENTER NIELSEN HAS IN TERMS OF THE CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO MOVE OUT THE RESOURCES QUICKLY. SO THIS IS A HOLDOVER HOLD OPEN ITEMS WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIFTY WHICH IS THE- TOURISM RECOVERY CAMPAIGN. WILL AGAIN TURN THE- THE ISSUE OVER TO MISTER WEATHERFORD FOODS- IS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU ISSUE NUMBER FIFTY IS THE SENATE'S BUDGET PLAN FOR FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO VISIT CALIFORNIA THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT A LOCAL REGIONAL AND NATIONAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN ENCOURAGING TRAVEL TO AND WITHIN CALIFORNIA. VERY GOOD- NEXT LIKE TO ASK- MELIA. THE MONEY TO- WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC POLICY FROM THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION TO PRESENT. MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK CLASS THE CHAIR SAID MY NAME IS AND MILLIONS OF MONEY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IN. ASSOCIATION WHERE THE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING THE TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR REQUEST FOR A FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME ALLOCATION TO FUND THE TOURISM MARKETING CAMPAIGN. PRODUCED BY THIS A CALIFORNIA% RECOVER THE STATE'S TOURISM ECONOMY. HOW TRAVELERS WERE MARGINALLY ENOUGH FAMILIAR LEGALLY NO ENGAGES WITH A LETTER. AND ADMINISTRATION PROTECT AND ENSURE A THRIVING TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY WE WORK CLOSELY WITH BUT ARE DISTINCT FROM ITS A CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A CALIFORNIA IS A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT FROM NEARLY THIRTY YEARS AGO TO MARKET CALIFORNIA TRAVELERS. THE MARKETING IS FINANCED BY ASSESSMENTS ON MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES BASED ON THE PORTION OF INCOME THAT COMES FROM TRAVELERS. TO THE PANDEMIC VISIT CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET WITH A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE FUNDED ON TOURISM BUSINESSES REVENUE. WHEN TRAVEL STOPPED SO DID THEIR FUNDING. IS A CALIFORNIA CONCERT CASH FOR RECOVERY CAMPAIGN BUT THEIR MARKETING WILL STOP IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR AS RESOURCES DWINDLE. CODE HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY UNKIND TO CALIFORNIA. TOURISM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA WAS THE COUNTRY'S TOP TOURISM ECONOMY IT'S NOW AMONG THE WORST PERFORMING ONLY FIVE STATES HAVE LOST MORE VISITOR SPENDING SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. CALIFORNIA LOST 2626% OF ITS MARKET SHARE TO OTHER STATES AND TWENTY TWENTY. FLORIDA AND TEXAS BOTH GREW THEIR MARKET SHARE LAST YER. ALARMINGLY IN THE CAPITAL FLORIDA OUR BIGGEST TOURISM COMPETITOR WAS RECENTLY ALLOCATED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THEIR STATE'S% BUDGET. TO MARKET THE STATE TRAVELERS INCLUDING TARGETING CALIFORNIANS. THIS PUTS US AT AN EVEN MORE OF A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE FLORIDA HAS BEEN OPEN FOR BUSINESS FOR MUCH OF THE PANDEMIC. HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING AWAY OUR VISITORS AND OUR RESIDENTS. SIX LOSSES ESPECIALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE TAXES PAID BY HOTEL AND VACATION RENTAL GUESTS DIRECTLY POWER LOCAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. FORTY SIX CITIES RELY ON TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX REVENUE. TO COVER AT LEAST 30% OF THEIR OVERALL GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE. SHARES FOR THE LOSSES MEAN LOSSES JUST. THIRTY BUCKS. GETTING CALIFORNIA'S TRAVELING AGAIN WILL ENABLE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES TO HELP AND GET WORKERS BACK TO THEIR JOBS. AND ULTIMATELY HELP THE ECONOMY RECOVER FROM KOBE. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES THE. FOR NINE ELEVEN AND I'LL KEEP SHORT TO DRIVE AN INCREMENTAL THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. A VISITOR SPENDING GENERATED TEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT STATE TAX REVENUE THAT MORE THAN REPAID THE STATES ONE TIME BEST MAN. IN STATE TRAVEL JUMPED 10% IN TWO THOUSAND ONE. TWO THOUSAND TWO AND TOURISM WAS ONE OF THE FASTEST INDUSTRIES TO RECOVER. IT GIVEN THE ALLOCATION UNDER CONSIDERATION TODAY IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT WAS A CALIFORNIA CAN GENERATE TEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN ADDITIONAL STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE OUR SUPPORT INCLUDING THIS CRITICAL ONE TIME FINDING DEPICTS A CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY- MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

BY PROVIDING QUALITY CARE FOR ALL PATIENTS EXPANDING ACCESS TO EXCELLENT AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND IMPROVING LIVING STANDARDS FOR ALL WORKERS. AS A MEMBER OF THE WORK COALITION WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERING SENATOR BACKERS BUDGET REQUESTS TODAY REGARDING HOW WORKER OWNERSHIP CAN CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE ECONOMY. ESPECIALLY FOR UNDERPAID WORKERS WORKERS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES FACE A DOOR CRISIS A COVERT NINETEEN INDUCED ECONOMIC SHUT DOWN AS WELL AS THE PRE XISTING WAVE OF BUSINESS CLOSURES DUE TO THE SILVER TSUNAMI OR BABY BOOMER BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE AT OR NEAR RETIREMENT AGE. EVEN BEFORE COATED THERE WERE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSINESSES AT RISK OF CLOSURE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEIR OWNERS ARE OLDER AND DON'T HAVE A SUCCESSION PLAN. RATHER THAN CLOSING FOR GOOD OR SELLING TO LARGE OUT OF STATE BUYERS CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN FIND WILLING BUYERS IN THE PEOPLE WHO WORK ALONGSIDE THEM EVERY DAY. THEIR WORKERS. TRANSITIONING TO WORKER OWNERSHIP WILL ANCHOR ESSENTIAL PRODUCTION SERVICES IN COMMUNITIES SAVE LIVELIHOODS OVER AT LAYOFFS BUILD WEALTH FOR CALIFORNIANS AND SAVE THE STATE MONEY. I'M FULLY OWNED BUSINESSES HAVE PROVEN THEMSELVES TO BE MORE RESILIENT AND MORE FOUR TIMES LESS LIKELY TO LAY PEOPLE OFF DURING THE PANDEMIC. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED STUDIES SHOW THAT WORKER OWNERSHIP IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS IS. GOOD FOR JOBS AND GOOD FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IT'S TRULY A WIN WIN WIN. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR WORKER OWNERSHIP ISN'T NOVEL THE FEDERAL MAINSTREAM PLAY OWNERSHIP ACT WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MANDATING THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT WORKER OWNERSHIP PROMPTING NEW AND CONTINUED SUPPORT IN A NUMBER OF STATES INCLUDING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS WILL CATALYZE INCLUSIONARY AND EQUITABLE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY WITHOUT REINVENTING THE WHEEL AND BY DEDICATING RESOURCES TOWARDS CONVERSIONS OF SMALL BUSINESSES. ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO IMPLEMENT A THREE YEAR STATEWIDE OUTREACH PROGRAM ABOUT WORKER OWNERSHIP. THIS CAMPAIGN WILL FOCUS ON THE VALUE OF WORKER OWNERSHIP AND SMALL BUSINESS RETENTION LAYOFF AVERSION AND COMMUNITY WEALTH BUILDING. AS WELL AS FINANCING OPTIONS TO SUPPORT THESE TRANSITIONS. TWENTY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO CREATE A DEDICATED LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM AT I. BANK. TO FINANCE BUSINESS CONVERSIONS QUALIFIED WORKER OWNERSHIP MODELS. WHEN A LOAN UNDER THESE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS FOR CHORES OF FUNDS IN THE LOAN GUARANTEE RESERVE CAN BE RELEASED BACK INTO THE DEDICATED POOL. TO SUPPORT MORE SMALL BUSINESS CONVERSIONS AND ENGAGEMENT CAPITAL PROVIDERS. THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR INCENTIVE GRANTS TO BUSINESSES THAT MEET SPECIFIED CONDITIONS FOR WORKER OWNERSHIP CONVERSIONS. AND THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING WOULD FUND TARGETED BUSINESS OUTREACH EFFORTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PROVIDERS.
