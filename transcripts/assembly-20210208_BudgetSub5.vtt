THAT WE'RE SAYING AND I THINK

00:56:22.912 --> 00:56:25.915

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:27.350

UNDERSTAND HOW. WHAT THE TRENDS

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:50.540
ARE AND WHETHER WE'RE ON TRACK

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:52.342
WE NEED TO SEE THOSE

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:53.910
EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES. PULLED

00:56:53.977 --> 00:56:56.112
OUT. WHICH IS LOOKING AT THE

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:58.448
DATA THAT YOU GAVE US. GOING

00:56:58.515 --> 00:56:59.816
THAT NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR TO

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:01.017
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR TO

00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:02.786
THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR

00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:05.155
WHICH IS THE PROPOSED BUDGET.

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:08.758
FROM. 201-922-2020 ONE BUDGET

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:11.694
WENT UP. BUDGET POSITIONS WHAT

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:15.098
UP AND THE PRISON POPULATION

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:16.099
STAYED ABOUT THE SAME FLIGHT

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:19.569
DROP BUT LOOKING FOR FROM

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:20.970
TWENTY TWENTY ONE ENACTED TO

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:23.907
THE PROPOSED BUDGET WE'RE

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:26.776
SEEING THE TOTAL BUDGET. NOT

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:28.812
REALLY CHANGING THAT MUCH BUT A

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:31.080
SEVENTY DAY BUT THE POPULATION

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:33.149
IS 77% OF WHAT IT HAD BEEN. AND

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:35.919
THE BUDGET POSITIONS OR OR 95%

00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:38.288
OF WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN. SO I

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:39.556
THINK WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:41.691
US TO UNDERSTAND. IF WE'RE

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.026
GOING TO BECAUSE AND A LOT OF

00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:44.460
YOUR COSTS ARE ARE TAKEN UP IN

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:46.196
PERSONNEL COSTS. SO AS WE'RE

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:49.432
TRACKING THE REDUCTION IN. THE

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:52.569
POPULATION OF PEOPLE ARE OF

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:55.405
COURSE RATED. WE NEED TO HAVE A

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:57.073
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.007
THAT IMPACT IS WITH THE BUDGET

00:57:58.074 --> 00:57:59.943
POSITIONS SO THAT WE CAN

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:01.411
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SAVINGS IS.

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:02.378
BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING A REAL

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:04.147
REDUCTION IN THE PUT THE OF THE

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:05.682
POPULATION BUT NOT A

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:06.916
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE

00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:09.118
BUDGET POSITIONS IT'S REALLY

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:10.920
HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.055
GETTING THE EFFICIENCIES THAT

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:13.957
WE'RE- EXPECTING TO GET OUT OF

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:15.625
IT AND THEN ADD ON TOP OF THAT

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:16.226
OF COURSE THE PRISON CLOSURES

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:18.361
WHICH WE'RE GONNA SEE. ADDED AT

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:20.597
A DIFFERENT HEARING. DOES ALL

00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:21.898
TAKEN TOGETHER OUR LITTLE

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:23.366
LITTLE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND

00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:24.834
WITH THAT THE LIMITED

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:27.237
INFORMATION THAT WE'VE- HAD

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:27.837
HERE TODAY SO THAT'S WHAT I'M

00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:29.572
REQUESTING IS TO SEE. IF WE CAN

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:33.309
GET THE PUBLIC RESPONSE MONEY

00:58:33.376 --> 00:58:34.777
TAKEN OUT OF THIS SO THAT WE

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:36.746
CAN MAKE SOME SENSE OF IT AND

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:37.614
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.016
THE PLAN IS FOR MANAGING THE

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.618
BUDGET POSITION SO THAT WE CAN

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:44.320
SEE HOW THE DROP AS WE'RE

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:46.623
CLOSING PRISONS AND AS- THE

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:48.157
AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION IS THE

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:50.627
DAILY POPULATION IS. WHERE THE

00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:52.061
OVERALL PRISON POPULATION IS

00:58:52.128 --> 00:58:54.530
DROPPING IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:57.667
TO SEE WHAT THOSE SAVINGS ARE.

00:58:57.734 --> 00:59:00.770
GOING TO LOOK LIKE OVER TIME.

00:59:00.837 --> 00:59:02.705
HI THIS IS ALLISON FROM THE

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:03.673
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEY JUST

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.208
WANT IT I CAME IN HERE WITH A

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.709
BIT OF A CLARIFYING POINTS SO

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:08.177
WE HAVE CALCULATED AS OF THE

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:10.146
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TWO HUNDRED

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:11.247
AND SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:12.515
MILLION DOLLARS IN POPULATION

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.050
SAVINGS THAT WOULD IT BE

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:16.185
REDIRECTED TO COVERT RESPONSE.

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.921
UNDER SECRETARY MENTIONS THAT

00:59:17.987 --> 00:59:20.189
WE'RE ESTIMATING BETWEEN

00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:21.090
NINETEEN TWENTY AND CURRENT

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:22.792
YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.694
ONE. AND EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:26.729
ONE BILLION DOLLARS I'M INTO

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:28.298
THE TO SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE

00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:29.065
IN THE CURRENT YEAR WHICH IS

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:30.566
ASSOCIATED WITH POPULATION

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:32.101
SAVINGS WOULD BE REDIRECTED TO

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:33.569
COPE IN RESPONSE WHICH STILL

00:59:33.636 --> 00:59:35.238
LEAVES A GAP I'M WHICH WERE

00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:36.072
STILL GOING TO. WITHIN THE

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:36.906
ADMINISTRATION STILL GOING TO

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:38.541
BE LOOKING AT IN ADDITION TO

00:59:38.608 --> 00:59:39.876
TRYING TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:41.511
FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE I'M

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:42.578
BUT I JUST WANTED TO CHIME IN

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:43.713
WITH THAT FIGURE IN CASE IT'S

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.114
HELPFUL TO YOU IT IS IT IS

00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:48.151
GOING OUT- AND CALLED OUT. AND

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:49.319
IN THE BUDGET DOCUMENTS BUT

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:53.022
HAPPY. TO PROVIDE ANY

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:53.589
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM

00:59:53.656 --> 00:59:54.624
THERE. WELL IF IT IS BUT I'M

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:58.328
ALSO LOOK. AT THE OVERALL N.

00:59:58.394 --> 00:59:59.595
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS IT IS A

00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:01.965
VERY SMALL DROP IN THE IN THE

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.366
BUDGET AND PART OF THAT AS WAS

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.801
EXPLAINED IS BECAUSE OF THE

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:09.405
COVERT EXPENSES. SO IF WHICH I

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:11.941
GUESS IS OKAY IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:14.477
TAKE THAT AND THEN. RECOGNIZE

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:17.213
WHAT THE SPECIFIC COVERED

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.247
EXPENSES ARE IN DEFICIT THAT

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.416
OUT. OKAY I JUST WANNA MAKE

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:22.318
SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING.

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.253
INFORMATION THAT WE CAN TRACK

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.255
AND SEE SO THAT WE CAN SEPARATE

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:28.825
THE COVERT RESPONSE. N. IN

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:31.527
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REDUCTIONS

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.997
ARE EVEN WHEN WE'RE TAKING A

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:34.597
LOOK AT THESE TOP LEVEL

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:36.799
POSITIONS OR THESE TOP LEVEL

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.668
KIND OF SUMMARIES. BECAUSE YOU

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.070
JUST LOOK AT. THE DAILY

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:43.139
POPULATION AND ITS DROP AND

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:44.273
THEN YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.808
POSITIONS AND THE TOTAL BUDGET

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.176
THEY'RE NOT DROPPING AT THE

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.345
SAME LEVEL. THEY'RE NOT

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.913
NECESSARILY GOING TO AND THAT'S

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.517
FINE BUT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:55.018
HOW ALL OF THOSE RELATE

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.954
TOGETHER. I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:00:58.021 --> 01:00:59.655
VERY HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO SEE.

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.224
WHAT MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WHAT

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.291
WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN WE

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:04.093
CAN DIFFERENTIATE THE COVERT

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.731
EXPENSES. OVER THE THIS YEAR.

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:11.401
BUDGET HERE LAST YEAR WHENEVER

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.369
THOSE ARE ARE RELATED AND

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.605
UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE ARE BEING

01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:17.507
IMPACTED WHERE WERE MAKING

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.042
THOSE INVESTMENTS WHERE THOSE-

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.877
DO WHERE THOSE ARE NEGATIVELY

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.678
AFFECTING THE SAVINGS WE WOULD

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:24.981
OTHERWISE EXPECT. JUST THAT WE

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:27.917
HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF KIND OF

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.186
THE TRACK THAT WERE ON. THANK

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:31.554
YOU AND I DID SOME QUICK MATH

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:34.457
AND WE HAVE AN OVER 20% DECLINE

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:37.894
IN THE PRISON POPULATION BUT-

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.363
ABOUT 4% DECLINE IN THE PROJECT

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.764
THE POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE HERE

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.633
YEAH- AND SO THE LEAST THAT

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.468
DISCREPANCY I THINK WE NEED TO

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.270
BE EXPLAINED TO US- MAYBE

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:48.704
THERE'S VALIDITY TO. TO OF

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.573
NUMBERS I AND THEN I WOULD GO

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.241
BACK TO THE SEPARATION IS

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:53.342
IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN LOOK AT

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:54.644
THE MOMENT RIGHT NOW BUT WE'RE

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:55.812
NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE IN THIS

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.680
MOMENT AND WE WANT TO BE

01:01:57.747 --> 01:02:01.150
PLANNING LONG TERM AS WELL. FOR

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:02.718
THOSE QUESTIONS MR STONE. WE

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:04.387
HAVE SOMEONE ELSE SOMEONE SPEAK.

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:08.191
MISTER JONES SAWYER. BUT IT

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.660
THANK YOU SECRETARY ALISON- A.

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:15.431
20% DECREASE. IS ALREADY BEEN

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:17.633
ADDRESSED AND I THINK WE REALLY

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.168
DO NEED SOME CLARIFICATION ON

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:22.038

REDUCTION PLAN FOR CDC ARE

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:56.545
RELATED TO POPULATION WAS TO

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:59.615
CUT- CONTRACT BASED FACILITY

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:01.383
ARE YOU SOME CONTRACTORS

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:03.018
FACILITIES FIRST. WE ARE

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:05.087
STARTING NOW TO GET INTO IS YOU

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.057
KNOW THIS LAST BUDGET HAS US

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:11.760
CLOSING DVI AND THEN WHAT IS

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.262
STILL PRESENT IN TWENTY TWO

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:14.296
TWENTY THREE OF THE POSITION

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:15.164
REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:18.600
THAT- WILL START- WILL START

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.836
GETTING HIGHER- BUT THAT WAS

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:21.670
PART OF OUR REGIONAL APPROACH

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:24.740
TO- GETTING US LESS RELIANT ON

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:26.842
OUR- OUT OF STATE PRISONS IN

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:29.244
ALABAMA AND OTHER PLACES. AND-

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:32.147
SO THAT WE CAN CUT THOSE FIRST

01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:36.218
I THINK THE SECOND THING. THAT

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:37.352
WE SHOULD MENTION IS THAT- OPEN

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:39.822
ITSELF IS A FAST MOVING SO. WE

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:41.557
DID NOT. PREDICT BE PART

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:44.226
DECREASED WE EXPERIENCED NOW.

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:46.328
AND- IT CORRECT HERE WHILE

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:47.429
REDUCING THE PAST YEAR LAST

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:51.400
YEAR'S BUDGET AXLE. EVENTUALLY

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:53.368
I THINK AS WE GET MORE DATA WE

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:59.174
WILL BE ABLE TO- FEDERAL LINE-

01:12:59.241 --> 01:12:59.775
THOSE TWO CATEGORIES OF DATA.

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:02.911
IN ADDITION TO THAT- I WILL SAY

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.880
THAT DUE TO CALL THAT A SOCIAL

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:06.548
DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS YOU

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.050
HAVE TO SPREAD OUT OUR

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.351
BLUEPRINT WHAT WE COULD TO

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:11.386
CONSOLIDATE HOUSING UNITS THAT

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:12.454
WE WOULD TYPICALLY BE ABLE TO

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:15.023
CONSOLIDATE- WHEN OUR

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.726
POPULATION IS LOWER. BUT DUE TO

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:18.560
COLD AND WE HAD A DARK

01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:19.795
SPECIALLY ARE OPEN DORMS WE

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:22.865
HAVE TO MAINTAIN SIX OF THE

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:25.167
DISTANCE AND SO WORRIED WE HAVE

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.136
A LARGER PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT.

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:28.303
AND YOU DON'T START SEEING

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.472
SAVINGS UNTIL YOU'RE ABLE TO

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.007
REDUCE THE STAFFING. CHECK FOR

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.309
WE CAN GET LET'S SAY- SO IT'S

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:36.945
ALSO COMPLICATING FACTOR. SO I

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:38.247
THINK WE'RE CLOSE IT IS OVER I

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:39.948
THINK YOU'LL YOU'LL START

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.550
SEEING SOME. SIGNIFICANT

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:43.318
SAVINGS THAT THAT EVERYBODY IS

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:49.091
ANXIOUS TO SEE BUT. PLEASE KEEP

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:49.958
IN MIND THAT WE STILL HAVE. YOU

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:50.559
KNOW NEARLY ALLOW THOUSAND IN

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.060
THE ACCOUNT JAILS HAVE TO IN

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.262
AND WE HAVE TO PAY THOSE X. TO

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:57.733
COUNT- INS IN THANK YOU FOR

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.469
HOUSING IN OUR OFFENDERS. THANK

01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:01.303
YOU THANK YOU KNOW OF WILL BE

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.705
UNDERSTOOD- SO I GUESS THE

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:06.241
GOING YOUR YOUR POINT SO WHEN

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:07.609
COLD FOOD IS NOT GOOD FOR THE

01:14:07.676 --> 01:14:09.344
ME JUST REPHRASE THE QUESTION

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:11.079
SO WHEN IT'S COLD IT IS OVER.

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:13.816
WHAT TYPE OF DROP IN

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:14.283
EXPENDITURE WOULD YOU

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:18.821
ANTICIPATE. HI ALEX CAN DO IT

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:19.721
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.123
I THINK JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.457
THE FIRST IS. ON THE BUDGET

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:24.326
DOES REFLECT SAVINGS ASSOCIATED

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.328
WITH THE CLOSURE OF DVI. I MEAN

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.263
THAT'S NINETY FOUR C. NINETY

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.666
FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION I'M IN

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:31.800
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND ONE

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:32.734
TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.570
IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.505
AGAIN THAT'S NOT THAT IS REALLY

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:37.773
WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.241
OF VERY DIRECT THE BEAMS COME

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.009
BECAUSE THE CLOSER CLICKS YOU

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:42.044
BE CLOSURE OF THE PRISON IS

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.345
REALLY IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:45.247
DECLINING PRISON POPULATION.

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.048
AND THEN THERE WILL BE OTHER

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:47.182
ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAPPENED ON

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:48.917
THE NATURAL DETERRENTS THAT ARE

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:50.786
EXCUSE ME TIED TO YOU DIRECTLY

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:51.854
TO THE POPULATION IN CITIES YOU

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.722
ARE SO THOSE WOULD. COME ON THE

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:54.790
NATURAL BUT I THINK WHAT WE

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:56.491
WOULD SAY IN THE NEAR TERM IS

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:59.027
IT'S NOT THAT. I'M AND A LOT OF

01:14:59.094 --> 01:14:59.728
WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN TERMS OF

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:01.763
THAT THAT POPULATION SAVINGS OR

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.632
SAVINGS THAT'S- RESULTING FROM

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:04.967
THE REDUCTION IN POPULATIONS IS

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:05.968
CAPTURED IN THE PRISON

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:07.669
CLOSURES. AND WE WOULD

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:09.171
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.039
CLOSE AN ADDITIONAL AND PRISON

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:13.108
WHICH WOULD COME FORWARD IN

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:13.709
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND SO

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:15.344
THAT WOULD AGAIN KIND OF. TIME

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:16.979
I'M CREATE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:17.980
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:19.014
REALIZED OVER THAT TIME I

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:20.949
THINK. THIS IS A WOULD BE ABLE

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:22.251
TO SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:15:22.317 --> 01:15:23.652
AS WELL. AND SO IS IT FAIR TO

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:24.486
ASSUME THAT WHEN THAT SECOND

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:27.189
FACILITY IS ANNOUNCED AND- SET

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.090
FOR CLOSURE WILL GET

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:35.030
APPROXIMATELY ABOUT THE SAME.

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:35.664
AMOUNT OF COST SAVINGS ROUGHLY.

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:36.398
IDON'T KNOW IF THAT'S- I MEAN

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:37.633
CERTAINLY BY OF THE ON. THAT'S

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:38.433
BUT I THINK THAT'S GOING TO. ON

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.868
A NUMBER OF. OPEN QUESTIONS

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:41.803
THIS TIME. NOTHING I CAN SHARE.

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.437
CERTAINLY THAT IN FOR. WOULD BE

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:43.972
A- IN THE- TO. FORWARD WHY IS

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.574
IT WHEN. EVEN PLAN ANNOUNCED

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:48.977
THE NEXT. I'M NOT ABLE TO SHARE

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:50.879
IT THIS TIME CERTAINLY HAPPY

01:15:50.946 --> 01:15:53.382
TED TIP- FOLLOW UP I KNOW THAT

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:57.252
I. DID YEAH. ANNOUNCEMENT IS

01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:57.819
TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THAT

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:58.687
WOULD WOULD THAT WOULD BE WHEN

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:00.188
WE BRING THE PROPOSAL FORWARD.

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:01.490
I'M NOT ABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:03.959
AS TO TIMING. THE TRUST GO BACK

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.127
TO THE CONTRACT BASED

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:08.497
FACILITIES THE- THE PARTY WAS

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:09.698
TALKING ABOUT I JUST WANNA

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:11.833
CLARIFY. I KNOW WE WERE VERY

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:15.337
MUCH IN FAVOR OF CLOSING OUT-

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.005
CONTRACTS HOWEVER I THINK THERE

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:19.608
WERE. SOME CONTRACT THE

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:20.976
FACILITIES THAT WE THOUGHT IT

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:23.078
MADE SENSE TO CONTINUE. SIMPLY

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:24.179
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:27.182
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SHAPE.

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.284
THAN THAN MANY OF OUR

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:30.786
FACILITIES AND SO WE DIDN'T

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:31.420
HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:34.856
DEFERRED. MAINTENANCE FOR THOSE

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.925
FACILITIES AS WE DO FOR. OTHER

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:38.994
FACILITIES INACTION FROM START

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:40.495
TO THE CONTRACT WITH WHICH WE

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:41.063
HAVE NO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:41.997
BECAUSE WE DON'T PAY FOR THAT.

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:43.265
SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD JUST

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:44.733
BE I THINK AN IMPORTANT

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.002
DISTINCTION I WOULD MAKE FOR. A

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:48.170
DEPARTMENT FROM OUR FROM OUR

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:49.237
POINT OF VIEW HOW IT MIGHT BE

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:52.407
JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:53.542
I'M I DID WANT ASK THE

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:55.277
DEPARTMENT WHETHER YOU AGREED

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:56.378
WITH THE L. A. AS ASSESSMENT

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:59.414
THAT. ON TOP OF- THE SECOND

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:01.316
FACILITY CLOSING THAT WITH THE

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:02.684
L. A. O. PROJECTED THAT WE

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:03.986
COULD BE CLOSING UP TO FIVE OF

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:06.788
TOTAL FACILITIES AND- WE

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:08.056
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT PROJECTION.

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:12.594
HE WELL FIRST LET ME ADDRESS

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:13.662
YOUR FIRST QUESTION AS IT

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:17.065
RELATES TO- SO WE HAVE

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.934
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FACILITIES

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:21.203
SO FOR EXAMPLE WE DO CONTRACT

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:23.739
WITH CALIFORNIA CITY AND OUR

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.374
CURRENT PROPOSALS JUST TO KEEP

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.676
CALIFORNIA CITY HAS A CONTRACT

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:30.012
CONTRACTED FACILITY WE TOTALLY

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:32.180
STAFF BUT WITH OUR STAFF BUT

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.048
YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:35.417
PHYSICAL PLANT IS MAINTAINED BY

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.319
THE CONTRACTOR THE FACILITIES

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:38.286
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.055
CLOSING OR COMMUNITY

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:42.724
CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES THAT

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:45.761
ARE- VERY SMALL FOOTPRINTS

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:48.230
LOWER LEVEL OFFENDERS- SO WE'RE

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.765
LIMITED ON WHAT WE ARE WHO WE

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.466
CAN HOUSE THERE. AND THEY

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:54.436
GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE- A HIGHER

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.138
LEVEL SECURE PERIMETER SO IT

01:17:56.204 --> 01:17:57.706
DOES LIMIT US ON WHO CAN HOUSE

01:17:57.773 --> 01:17:59.341
THERE THE CURRENT ONE THAT IS

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:01.276
SCHEDULED TO CLOSE IN MAY AS

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.445
OUR LAST- FEMALE OFFENDER

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.514
PROGRAM WHICH IS A MCFARLANE

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:08.483
CALIFORNIA- AND SO THAT'S THE

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:13.121
LAST. ONE THAT IS SCHEDULED TO

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:15.023
CLOSE. AND NOW I'VE LOST MY BY

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:16.691
JENNIFER AS TO GET RESERVE

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:17.259
QUESTION WAS JUST REGARDING

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:17.959
WERE YOU AGREE WITH L. A.

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.561
ELSESSER THAT POTENTIALLY UP TO

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:20.195
FIVE FACILITIES COULD BE CLOSED

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:21.463
IN THE FUTURE. IN THE NEAR

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:25.367
FUTURE. WELL OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.002
TO MAKE DECISIONS AND COBIZ

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:28.970
TAUGHT US A LOT AS IT RELATES

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:29.871
TO PHYSICAL PLANT OF OUR

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:32.641
FACILITIES. AND HOW WE HOUSE-

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:36.945
OFFENDERS- I WILL SAY NOBODY.

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:40.282
KNEW AS FAR AS THAT OPEN CELL.

01:18:40.348 --> 01:18:43.051
CELL PHONES AS WELL AS YOUR

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:46.521
SETTINGS. ON HOW RAMPANT IT

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.523
WOULD GROW WITHIN THOSE

TO PASS THAT TO MR LACKEY TO

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.810
ASK THIS QUESTION OF XTC HAD

01:39:42.876 --> 01:39:46.280
EARLIER. THANK YOU BOB MY

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:50.517
QUESTION- I KNOW MISTER KELSO

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:52.653
YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.088
WE'VE HAD A SIMILAR SEARCH IN

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:54.988
THE PRESENCE OF THE PAD IN THE

01:39:55.055 --> 01:39:57.591
PUBLIC BUT THE PRESIDENT THERE

01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:58.859
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SYSTEM

01:39:58.926 --> 01:40:01.128
WE HAVE A CONTROL SPACE- WHERE

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:02.296
WE HAVE STAFF THAT ARE SUPPOSE

01:40:02.363 --> 01:40:04.198
TO BE DOESN'T REGULARLY PEOPLE

01:40:04.264 --> 01:40:05.265
ARE SUPPOSED TO VERY MATH WE

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:07.434
HAVE WITH WILL BE SCREENING

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:08.001
PEOPLE AND THEY ENTERED THE

01:40:08.068 --> 01:40:09.603
PRINCESS. KEEPING PEOPLE

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:13.207
SEPARATED- AND SO FORTH I AND

01:40:13.273 --> 01:40:15.275
SO IT'S NOT THE SAME AS THE

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:16.410
GENERAL PUBLIC OUT THERE TO

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:18.345
VERY DIFFERENT CONTROLLED SPACE

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:20.381
AND WHILE WE CAN'T COMPLETELY

01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:22.082
STOP THE SPREAD OF COVERAGE WE

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:23.717
COULD DEFINITELY MITIGATE THE

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:24.852
CASES OR HOW QUICKLY IT

01:40:24.918 --> 01:40:26.720
SPREADING INSIDE IN THE CAR

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:28.555
ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OVER TIME.

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:31.325
AND SO DO YOU NOW THAT YOU ARE

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:32.659
SAYING YOU. YOU'RE LEARNING

01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:36.430
SOME LESSONS- AND WE CAN MAYBE

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:37.564
ADMIT THAT THE POLICIES WERE

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:38.966
NOT SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN WITH

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:40.334
HOW ARE WE ENSURING THAT WE

01:40:40.401 --> 01:40:42.069
HAVE COMPLIANCE ACROSS ALL

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:43.937
THIRTY FIVE STATE TO THAT-

01:40:44.004 --> 01:40:45.305
FOLKS ARE WEARING THEIR MATH WE

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:46.640
ARE SOCIALLY DISTANCING WE ARE

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:48.075
USING ALL THE BEST PRACTICES WE

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:50.043
ARE ADHERING TO WHAT THE CDC IS

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:53.180
RECOMMENDING OUT THERE NOWTEN

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:53.714
MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD WITH

LESSONS LEARNED. I'M SURE- I

01:40:58.585 --> 01:40:59.620
THINK IT TO ASPECTS OF YOUR

01:40:59.686 --> 01:41:01.522
QUESTION I THINK. ON THE FIRST

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:02.856
IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANT TO TRY

01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:04.591
TO MAKE URE WE HAVE MASK

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:06.360
WEARING. ON AND JUST INSANE

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.929
RIDICULOUS BY STAFF WILL ALSO.

01:41:08.996 --> 01:41:11.665
BY INMATES. OF THE ANSWER THAT

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:12.833

DISCIPLINE UP TO THE LEVEL OF

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:29.550
WORK- WAS NOT. WEARING A MASK.

01:41:29.616 --> 01:41:31.785
FOR AND WE'RE LOOK THEM IMPROVE

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:35.989

THINK OF STUFF ARE BEING TAKEN

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:49.136
THE TO RECRUIT COMPLY. THIS

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:55.175

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:56.643
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S SORT OF A

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.679
CONTROLLED AND- BUT IS A

01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:01.148
CONTROLLING. WHERE YOU'VE GOT

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:03.050

THE- OF THIS RECORD NINETEEN

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:48.842
PROBLEM. I THINK IT WAS

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:50.777
REFERRING ONLY TO THE INMATES I

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:52.145
WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS THE

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:53.546
COMMENSURATE RELATIONSHIP

01:50:53.613 --> 01:50:55.081
BETWEEN THE INMATES AND THOSE

CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WHO ALSO

CONTRACTED THAT MAY HAVE-

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:03.189
ONGOING CONDITIONS THAT WOULD

01:51:03.256 --> 01:51:05.191
REQUIRE IN A WORKMAN'S COMP

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:07.460
COSTS. BECAUSE THOSE ARE ALL

01:51:07.527 --> 01:51:10.330
VERY SIGNIFICANT BUDGET

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:11.331
CONCERNS THAT WE NEED TO PLAN

01:51:11.398 --> 01:51:15.235
FOR. WELL I THINK YOU'RE ASKING

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:18.071

THE DISEASE VICE FOR STAFF AND

01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:24.344
THE ANSWER IS NO- THAT WAS- A

01:51:24.411 --> 01:51:27.814
LITTLE BIT HARDER. PROCESS OF

01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:29.382
THE WAY WE WERE ABLE TO ANIMATE

01:51:29.449 --> 01:51:32.986
THE- SPREAD OF THE DISEASE OF

01:51:33.053 --> 01:51:34.487
THE INCARCERATED POPULATION WAS

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:38.024
BY. PHYSICALLY MAPPING WHERE

01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:41.895
THEIR BEDS WERE- THAT WE DIDN'T

01:51:41.961 --> 01:51:45.932
HAVE THAT INFORMATION FOR UP

01:51:45.999 --> 01:51:46.466

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:56.342
ASPECT. THE CORRECTIONAL

01:51:56.409 --> 01:51:57.710
OFFICERS AND THE STAFF THEY

01:51:57.777 --> 01:51:59.412
WERE DEALING WITH THE INMATES

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.448
HAD VERY LITTLE SPREAD. IS THAT

01:52:01.514 --> 01:52:04.150
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME. WELL

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:07.587
CERTAINLY NOT AS ARE NOT AS

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:09.155
DRAMATIC AS THE INCARCERATED

01:52:09.222 --> 01:52:12.992
POPULATION- THE NUMBERS WERE

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:17.864
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT- I'M

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:20.633
LOOKING TO SEE IF I HAVE HERE.

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:27.907
THE NUMBERS FOR THE- FOR THE

01:52:27.974 --> 01:52:30.076
STAFF INFECTIONS I DON'T THINK

01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:32.946
I HAVE THOSE- BUT IF WE COULD

01:52:33.012 --> 01:52:34.047
GET ALONG TO BE HIGHLY

01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:36.216
INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT WHAT

THEY ARE JUST FOR SAFETY

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:38.785
PURPOSES AND THOSE ARE

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:40.987
ACTUALLY- RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:52:41.054 --> 01:52:42.322
CARING FOR THE INMATES I THINK

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:46.559
THAT WE HAVE A STRONG DUTY TO-

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:47.894
MAKE SURE THAT WE BUDGET.

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.028
APPROPRIATELY SOUGHT THEIR

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:50.663
COVERED FOR BECAUSE I CAN TELL

01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:52.298
YOU A LOT OF THE HAVING BEEN A

01:52:52.365 --> 01:52:54.300

VIRUS I HAVE ONGOING. HEALTH

01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:59.072
ISSUES. THAT THE THEY'RE NOT

01:52:59.139 --> 01:53:01.741
CHEAP. AND SO THESE ARE ALL

01:53:01.808 --> 01:53:03.476
VERY SIGNIFICANT COSTS THAT WE

01:53:03.543 --> 01:53:04.677
NEED TO BUDGET FOR AND THAT'S

01:53:04.744 --> 01:53:05.879
ALL I'M TRYING TO I'M NOT

01:53:05.945 --> 01:53:06.846
TRYING TO POINT FINGERS ANYBODY

01:53:06.913 --> 01:53:09.149
I JUST WANT. INFORMATION SO WE

02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:15.721
I WOULD ADD IS THAT YOU CAN

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:17.122
ALSO SAY THAT EVERY PATIENT IS

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:18.991

PATIENTS ALLOCATED CORPORATE

02:08:23.929 --> 02:08:29.635
RESOURCES OR INCREASED RISK.

02:08:29.701 --> 02:08:30.269

GOING FORWARD YEAH I HAD TO DO

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:45.951
WITH WHERE PATIENTS WITH

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:48.353
ELEVATED RISK SCORES COULD BE

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:50.189
PROBLEMS. HE MOVED FROM ONE

02:08:50.255 --> 02:08:51.790
PLACE TO ANOTHER WHAT TYPE OF

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:53.692
MONITORING WOULD TAKE PLACE OF

02:08:53.759 --> 02:08:56.328
PATIENTS DURING OUR BREAK SO WE

02:08:56.395 --> 02:08:58.564
CAN RAPIDLY IDENTIFY THOSE THAT

02:08:58.630 --> 02:09:00.766
NEEDED A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE.

02:09:00.833 --> 02:09:02.501
THE TYPE OF TREATMENT WAS

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:04.236
PROVIDED TO PATIENTS. WITH

02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:05.938
DISABILITIES PRIOR TO THEM

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:09.842

OF HOW PATIENTS ARE TREATED

02:09:15.347 --> 02:09:16.982
WITH WRESTLING IMPLEMENTED

02:09:17.049 --> 02:09:18.817

AND TRAGIC BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A

02:09:31.196 --> 02:09:33.198
PERSON ALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR

02:09:33.265 --> 02:09:36.935
OVERALL RISK POPULATION. IN OUR

02:09:37.002 --> 02:09:39.471
ALREADY SEEN WITH MORE

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:41.740
EXTENSIVE VACCINATION. THE RISK

02:09:41.807 --> 02:09:43.675

02:10:10.702 --> 02:10:13.172
THREAT. HE WAS NOT. CONVINCE

SCIENTIFICALLY ACCEPTED AS THE

02:10:16.008 --> 02:10:23.315
THREAT- I THINK THAT MOST

PEOPLE USING COMMONSENSE KNEW

02:10:23.982 --> 02:10:27.853
