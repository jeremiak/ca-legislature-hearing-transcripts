ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:33.777
OF COURSE. IT'S A IT'S A- TO

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:35.245
REALLY- IMPOSSIBLE FIGHT TO WIN

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:37.114
AGAINST THE C. SO THESE ARE

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:39.550
SOME TOUGH CHOICES- BUT WE'RE-

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:40.851
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:42.086
THIS BILL IS PROVIDE LOCAL

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:42.886
GOVERNMENTS WITH AN INNOVATIVE

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:44.488
FINANCING OPTION TO ALLEVIATE

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:45.823
THE REST OF C. LEVEL RISE WHILE

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:47.157
PROTECTING BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:48.959
AND TAXPAYERS. IT BASICALLY

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:50.661
STOP WHICH IS A REVOLVING LOAN

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:51.862
FUND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:52.830
BUY PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.365
THREATENED IN A DECADE OR TWO.

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.500
AND THEN IT ALLOWS THE OWNERS.

00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:58.102
TO SELL WHILE THE HOUSE IS

00:43:58.168 --> 00:43:59.103
STILL HAS VALUE AND THEN THE

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:00.871
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CAN THEN RENT

00:44:00.938 --> 00:44:01.905
OUT THE PROPERTY WE'RE TALKING

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:03.107
ABOUT VERY VIABLE PROPERTIES

00:44:03.173 --> 00:44:04.508
OFTEN TIMES IT CAN BE RENTED AT

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:06.910
A VERY HIGH AND- AMOUNT. AND

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.012
THE IDEA IS THAT THAT WILL THEN

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:10.781
REPAY THE LOAN AND POTENTIALLY

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.249
EVEN EARN REVENUE OVER TIME.

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:13.650
AND THEN WHEN THE RISK. OF

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:15.652
FLOODING FROM RISING SEA LEVELS

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.521
GETS TO AND- AND UNBEARABLE

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:18.555
POINT THE HOUSE COULD BE

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:19.790
DEMOLISHED OR RELOCATED WITHOUT

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:24.528
LOCAL RESIDENTS. OR TAXPAYERS

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:25.129
BEARING THE COST. YOU THAT IF

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:26.096

HAVE A- MANY CO. COMMUNITIES

00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:28.532
ARE RISK HOMEOWNERS AND

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.701
TAXPAYERS CAN REMAIN WHOLE. WE

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:32.169
CAN ACTUALLY BREAK EVEN WITH

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:34.838
THIS. NOT ILL HELP TO ALLEVIATE

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:36.874

ANYTHING GREATLY DIMINISHED.

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:53.654
