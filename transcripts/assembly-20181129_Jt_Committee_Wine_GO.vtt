its ability to be successful

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.354
for example earlier this year

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:17.883
twenty -- probation --

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.419
it affected the southern

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:22.922
California industry especially

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:24.523
to the extent that there were

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.559
only two wineries that really

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.227
exist today that were there

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.775
make one in a bathtub but --

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:45.311
due to one reason tenure with

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.512
county that did manage to

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:49.015
survive today as the burn are

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.983
wondering in Rancho Bernardo

winery in in -- Escondido

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.026
-- as far as one industry

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:01.394
we could fast forward to two

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.030
thousand and ten -- that's with

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:06.399
that's with the county of

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:08.601
San Diego adopted the turn

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.169
one new ordinance by the board

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:12.471
of supervisors of this ordinance

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:15.674

industry in San Diego county --

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.446
the the orders were spearheaded

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.049
by our local supervisor Diane

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:25.418
Jacobs -- she led the whole

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:27.853
industry with this led to a

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.221
whole new industry of boutique

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:31.757
wineries in the county --

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:34.994
my next line

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:38.197
yeah --

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.500
this slide represents

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:43.002
the number of --

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:47.039
one gorgeous this is the way

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:48.974
more licenses that are issued

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.376
in the different counties

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:52.244
of the state are you can see

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:53.546
that same day -- actually has

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:54.880
a hundred and seventy four

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:57.483
license to one growing --

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:02.288
a permits in the state

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:04.790
and we exchanged -- to make

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.525
it -- by almost a hundred

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:09.228
percent -- of these

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:10.963
hundred and seventy four of

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.632
Lysons winegrowers tied to

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:16.202
Lysons -- hunt one hundred

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:17.503
and fifteen of the more

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.505
active wineries in the county

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:25.377
for and you can

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:27.546
see by this slide that up until

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:29.849
two thousand four we had a

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:32.551
a real low issuances of new

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:35.521
licenses -- ran from one to

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:38.023
to actually here

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:41.594
and end with the anticipation

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.062
because that one is was and

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:45.164
was worked on for many years

00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:46.832
but with the anticipation

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.901
of -- that one is coming

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:50.402
to affect the world more

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:52.605
applications for you --

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.741
applied for and you can tell

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:57.343
that in two thousand and ten

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.044
it really took off because

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:01.213
of the application rate --

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.249
exit ended up I think in two

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:05.651
thousand seventeen we had a

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:07.186
a twelve a two thousand sixteen

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:09.188
we had a total of -- twenty

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:11.056
six licenses issued in the

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:13.893
county of San Diego --

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:19.265
the F. thirty the in I I will

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:20.499
explain a little bit the dip

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.101
in the end of the graft that

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:24.870
was only up until -- July

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.972
of this year so it it kind of

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:29.108
construed that crafted shouldn't

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:30.476
take that sharp did because

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.077
we have had quite a few a

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:35.214
licenses issued since that --

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.952
in two thousand and we did an

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.955
economics impact study -- of

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:45.191
the -- warning growing and

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:47.126
-- or grape growing and wine

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:48.761
industry and saying you county

00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:51.063
two thousand sixteen and we

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.699
read -- fresh that

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:55.467
study in two thousand

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:57.970
seventeen in a couple of the --

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:00.639
-- numbers that we came up

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:01.807
with on the two thousand

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:04.243
and seventeen study our

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.679
industry -- generated twenty

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:07.947
six million dollars in

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.683
sales -- for in the county

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.985
and it had a fifty million

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:16.288
dollar a year impact

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:19.325
-- economic impact in the area

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:21.093
in this represented a forty

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.661
and forty percent increase

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:24.196
from the previous study

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.232
-- just in one year which

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:28.100
really the dynamics of the

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.836
industry is really growing --

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:38.477
okay dish map shows the

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.312
county of San Diego and

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:43.215
also the -- three ABA use

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:45.217
the represented in the county

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.320
and -- so San Diego county

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.322
is home to three AB aids the

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.591
light green door which

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:55.160
covers most of this map is

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:57.029
actually the south coast --

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:59.365
ABA and it stretches from our

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:01.300
room all the way down to --

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.769
the Mexican border and it

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:06.305
covers most of the county -- we

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.974
have a a little bit darker

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:12.578
-- well it's almost a rectangle

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:14.446
-- there on the center of the

00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:16.649
map and that is the scene you

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:18.050
know I mean that is a remote

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:20.819
valley ABA and you can

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.888
not quite make it out but

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:24.590
between with the Ramona Valley

00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:26.859
aviators in Escondido there's

00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:28.894
a small were it's almost a more

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:31.363
yellowish tented area and

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.198
that's the samples call Valley

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.034
eighty eight and actually the

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.835
simple call valley AVA is one

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.737
of the oldest -- eighties in

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.739
the country I think it ranks

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.207
third or fourth grade behind

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:43.609
napa and though it might

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:44.910
be one Ohio I think there's

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:46.879
actually the first one but --

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:49.348
so we were pretty proud about

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.350
that and -- actually most of

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.052
the warnings in the county

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:55.554
-- do Kerry that -- south

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.856
coast eighty eight although

00:15:57.923 --> 00:15:59.458
it does get confused a lot of

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:01.460
times with to macula because

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:03.329
Temecula actions in the same

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:07.299
but -- since it encompasses

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:08.901
rural area we we share

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.903
that with them --

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.642
let me back up to the slide

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:18.210
once again I one thing I

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:19.745
would like to point out of

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.780
the black dots on the map

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:23.515
that represents -- each dot

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:25.084
represents a different winery

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.453
in the county in our industry

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.888
is very diverse -- it stretches

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.023
from the north the county to

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.058
the south the county to the east

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.728
county and along the coast --

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.497
so as opposed to some other

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.099
is that were wineries are very

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.267
concentrated -- we're really

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:43.769
spread out throughout the county

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.637
a one thing this does do this

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:47.606
allows for many variations in

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.842
the the growing environment of

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:52.244
grapes -- which is really --

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:55.147
-- a good thing for San Diego

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:57.049
because really if you come to

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:59.284
San Diego county -- you do get

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.387
a a it you can taste a lot of

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:04.189
different types of wine --

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.328
slide five represents the

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:11.663
increase of a production

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.565
in the county and

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:17.336
and -- also the increase of

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.405
acreage in the county anything

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:20.973
will come of that amount of

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:22.941
a correction of the incomes

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:25.544
harvested -- our average

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:26.912
production runs about two

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:29.515
tons per acre and this remains

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:32.117
-- represents how the with

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.019
the grapes and the one or the

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.321
one in the in the produced

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:38.157
in the county -- change a

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:39.992
very -- concentration of

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:41.927
flavors and complexity with

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:44.730
low production yields --

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.535
slide six service the

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:51.570
different varieties and

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:52.805
how they're distributed

00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:54.606
in accounting -- Cabernet

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:58.043
Sauvignon being the the most --

00:17:58.444 --> 00:18:00.779
slanted but -- really there's

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:01.847
not a lot of difference

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.082
between -- the ten top

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:07.319
of righties here --

00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:09.455
as far as some of the concerns

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:10.556
with some of the gross in the

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:13.025
county -- one of the concerns

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:16.795
is the state water

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.464
board investor là discharge

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.999
permit that is a -- permit this

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:23.368
required of any -- commercial

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:25.704
agricultural processor a

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.006
producer in the state -- no

00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:30.409
matter what the size and we

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:32.911
found that the the small

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:34.279
boutique wineries really have

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:35.747
very minimal effect on the

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:38.083
watershed in the county but you

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.451
know we're really treated like

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:41.553
-- somebody that has a thirty

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.455
thousand acre farm that might

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:46.058
use a large amount of irrigation

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.160
might have more impact -- and

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:49.962
that's an issue that I know the

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:51.663
can't Sania county farm bureau

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.899
has been working with -- the

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:56.835
local of water board of

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:58.971
to see if -- we can maybe come

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.706
to some interest understanding

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:02.608
and some recognition that

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:03.942
the impact that we have

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:06.011
on our ecosystem is not as

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:08.480
large as as what of the

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:10.749
permit might think it is

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.819
-- also all wrapped up

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:15.988
and a few comments about

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:18.190
myself eight did have a nice

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:19.258
introduction but I am the

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:20.626
president of the case Sandia

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:22.394
counties veterans association

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.696
which represents over half of

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:26.431
the wineries in the state in the

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:28.634
in the county excuse me of

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.669
this association is composed of

00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:33.505
urban -- book teeth

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:36.575
Jose wineries and small wineries

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:39.211
are and they are located in

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.179
the unincorporated areas of

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.482
the county and also several

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.284
cities within the county

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:48.720
-- as stated I I have

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:50.689
ever control my life

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:52.024
growing up in a business

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:55.160
with cal poly promoter wearing

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:57.629
graduated there I serve time

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:58.864
in a nice lunch marine corps

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:01.133
during the Vietnam era and

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:02.768
more recently along with my wife

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:04.369
and son we started hungry hawk

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:07.172
vineyards in Escondido and --

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:09.775
actually the adoption of the two

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:12.644
thousand and ten -- boutique

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.513
winery órdenes in the county

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.282
was one of the main -- points

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.384
the promised to starting the

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:21.587
winery because if this had

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:24.323
not happened -- the economic

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.226
to cross before the enactment

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:30.596
of this -- legislation --

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:32.564
would have been the application

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.666
of major management and general

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:35.934
accounting goes will run up

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:37.436
to a quarter million dollars

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:39.504
which will ages does away with

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:41.573
the small forming aspect of the

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.276
boutique winery industry of

00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:47.479
just to sum up my should in

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:49.448
the San Diego county jury grand

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:50.916
jury from two thousand seven

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:53.018
two thousand eight as a the

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:55.554
committee chair of the Auburn

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:57.923
at auto in the ministration

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.891
committee and I also served on

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.293
the house of accountable for

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.128
six years since I wasn't have

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:05.063
called industry for a period of

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.799
time -- thank you for everybody

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:09.067
listening to what I had to say

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:11.203
and -- welcome and I really

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:12.170
look forward to the rest of

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.538
this question today thank you

00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:20.979
so thank you very much Mister

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:22.614
Emily and I'm going to first

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:24.750
ask if any of the -- committee

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:25.784
members have questions

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.121
the summer Waldron okay

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:31.690
thank you -- since my son

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:33.558
is -- right now is looking

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:34.559
to going to college is a

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.228
senior in high school so I

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:39.131
heard about -- your

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:40.932
Vince viticulture technician

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:43.502
apprenticeship program and

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:45.337
-- you know helps address the

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:47.339
labor gap could you tell us

00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:49.441
more about that and how that

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:50.909
got set up and how it works

00:21:52.544 --> 00:21:54.279
all we do have one member

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.014
-- or actually the chairman

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.649
of that committee here

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:59.651
to the hearing today and

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:00.919
she was going to go into

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.522
depth on that but -- that

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:04.790
is a program that was really

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:08.260
started -- to help provide

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:11.229
-- competent and trained --

00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:14.499
people to grow up

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:16.601
into the industry --

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.672
we do everything manually and

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:22.708
by hand and our wineries in our

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:25.444
vineyards -- because there's

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.312
the small small size we can't

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:29.181
really afford mechanized

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:31.950
methods of pruning or harvesting

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:33.685
so it does get back to do

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:35.954
manual labor -- it does

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.657
require a skill set a

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:41.760
sales a to properly to that

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:43.161
and the bill to cultural

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:45.697
program was really bad on to

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:48.100
help provide a basic course

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:50.402
to people in the in the

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:54.339
the room wanting

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.875
to get into the industry --

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:59.544
and it also educate

00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:02.481
them on -- how when we operates

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:04.616
in sales -- taste hero so

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.985
it's a very broad based --

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.488
room -- something that I'm

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.289
very happy to be involved

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.824
with I serve on the board

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.359
of directors for that

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.728
organization and -- I am

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:18.063
proud to be in that position

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:22.501
yeah Mister Emily -- as you know

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.369
each state has different wind

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:26.438
shipping regulations can you

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:27.873
discuss the impact that this

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:30.342
may have on your members

00:23:30.408 --> 00:23:31.643
and what you do to educate

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.111
them on the different --

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:35.413
shipping regulations yeah

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.182
that's a real can of worms --

00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:41.386
the wine institute has been a

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:44.489
great purveyor of information

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:46.558
on that subject and it really

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:47.659
gets down to a point for

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:50.228
vault small when Reyes to

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.730
ship out of state it's almost

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.899
impossible on your own --

00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:55.901
each day normally requires a

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:58.203
license and a permit -- to be

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.239
renewed each year at sometimes

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:03.642
preserve central rates --

00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:07.245
the bookkeeping so without

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:10.081
some -- other industries

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:11.449
that help support us in that

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:12.984
it would be almost impossible

00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:15.287
-- personally we use a company

00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:17.422
name sharper and I'm not trying

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:19.925
to make a promotion here but

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:22.294
actually we sell one to them

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.129
they do all the paperwork --

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:25.597
they ship us being sent us a

00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:28.600
label -- the ship

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:30.535
and -- they collect all the

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:31.937
money in it for the money

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:35.273
minus their and expenses

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.876
to us and they have all

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:40.178
with the state permits -- and

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:41.112
they take care of the book

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:43.949
worked -- Adam well I find

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:45.984
it quite reasonable fee which

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.420
-- before we don't have been

00:24:48.486 --> 00:24:49.721
with that company maybe nine

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:51.456
months prior to that we had

00:24:51.857 --> 00:24:53.058
individual lessons for the

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:55.994
state of -- Michigan Colorado

00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:58.396
in I believe Arizona even just

00:24:58.463 --> 00:24:59.831
three states really made a

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:02.701
pretty it impacted office work

00:25:05.537 --> 00:25:06.504
you asked one question

00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:11.276
right now I'm sure someone's

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:12.244
going to have more questions

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.411
afterwards -- please

00:25:13.478 --> 00:25:15.046

Santa squall winery where local

urban winery just outside of San

00:26:51.576 --> 00:26:54.212
Diego in the city of la mesa and

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.780
also the wine maker one of the

00:26:55.847 --> 00:26:58.016
almost twenty women wine makers

00:26:58.083 --> 00:27:00.752
in San Diego county yeah

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:03.989
about ten years ago now when it

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:05.857
was located in a small warehouse

00:27:05.924 --> 00:27:07.225
producing a few hundred cases

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:09.127
of wine a year I was a middle

00:27:09.194 --> 00:27:11.429
school speech therapist and

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:13.565
my husband was and continues

00:27:13.631 --> 00:27:15.133
his full time employment as a

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.302
research psychologist we had

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.770
plenty of experience with wine

00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:20.739
drinking but no experience

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:23.308
with wine making similarly

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:25.010
the vast majority of San Diego

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:26.444
county vendors and wine grape

00:27:26.511 --> 00:27:28.747
growers are first generation

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:30.482
taking down the challenges

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:32.283
enjoys a vineyard and winery

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.818
ownership while keeping their

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:36.321
day jobs or after retirement

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:38.990
our goal had been to open a wine

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:41.292
bar we signed urban winery for

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:43.228
sale just after the regulations

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:45.296
changed that allowed wineries

00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:47.198
to also sell wine by the glass

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:49.134
instead of just a wine tasting

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:51.202
it seems that it could be the

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:52.771
wine bar without the middle

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:54.572
man if we could make our own

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:57.108
wine we bought the winery and

00:27:57.175 --> 00:27:58.676
when I wine maker was no longer

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.745
available I went back to school

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:02.680
nights in Somers while taking on

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:05.383
wine making duties I completed

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.618
one production class at a

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:08.186
local community college during

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.721
our first production season

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:11.723
and then the online winemaker

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.525
certificate program from UC

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:15.660
Davis now we produce about

00:28:15.727 --> 00:28:17.228
four thousand cases of whining

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:19.264
year and we have won numerous

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.499
awards from the county state and

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:23.535
international wine competitions

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:25.670
yeah we're excited thank you

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.407
we now currently employs

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:31.476
sixteen people at four different

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:33.845
locations in the San Diego area

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:36.848
also send wondering is one of

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:39.017
the almost twenty urban wineries

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:41.486
in San Diego county typically

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.621
located in city industrial

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:45.857
areas urban wineries do not

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:47.992
have their own vineyards but

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:50.095
by grapes from local growers

00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:52.597
within the county state or some

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:54.833
even from outside of California

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:56.501
we checked the grapes here

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:58.069
and produce the winds in our

00:28:58.136 --> 00:29:00.505
facilities although not bound

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.474
by the county winery ordinance

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.409
regulations urban wineries was

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:06.644
followed local city regulations

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.246
in addition to the state A. B.

00:29:08.313 --> 00:29:10.915
C. T. T. B. and now FDA

00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:13.952
regulations I was also the

00:29:14.018 --> 00:29:15.353
first woman president of the

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.554

our local wine industry

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:37.041
unlike more established wine

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:39.611
regions San Diego does not have

00:29:39.677 --> 00:29:41.346
an adequate supply of trained

00:29:41.412 --> 00:29:43.114
winery and vineyard workers

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.984
available in the area to remedy

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.685
this the business association

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:49.654

your occasion and then learn the

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:16.581

00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:26.024
base we developed a list of

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.659
critical task for working in

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:29.994

room and assigned hours that

00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:33.831
may typically be required to

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:36.267
develop mastery in each each

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.869
a press takes one class per

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:43.308
fifteen hundred hours per year

wineries demonstrate and teach

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:53.384
best practices and report

meeting these establish goals

00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:01.125
thanks to the California

college division of workforce

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:08.933
and economic development we

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.468
were able to install a half

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:12.637
acre demonstration vineyard

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:13.905

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:17.875
participate in an actual

00:31:17.942 --> 00:31:20.011
installation and now vineyard

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:22.013
maintenance and a couple of

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.114
years we look forward to the

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:24.649
premises harvesting and making

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:26.918
our first wine I next step

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.686
is to help add viticulture

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.622
class to the community college

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:33.324
curriculum the apprenticeship

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:34.459
program is sponsored by

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:36.761
grants fundraising and small

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:38.496
contributions from the STC

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:41.666
VA and apprentices employers

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:44.168
unlike most apprenticeship

00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:46.271
programs we are not the

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:49.207
beneficiary beneficiary of large

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:51.342
labor unions apprenticeship

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:52.844
employers must hold workman's

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.112
comp insurance and have a

00:31:54.178 --> 00:31:56.314
payroll system in place that

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:58.483
being said unfortunately the

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:00.018
majority a vineyard and winery

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.386
owners in San Diego county

00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:03.321
were small and family owned and

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:05.423
operated carrying workman's comp

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.158
insurance for the small produces

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:09.427
is a financial hardship so

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:11.329
they are not able to participate

00:32:11.396 --> 00:32:13.364
in the apprenticeship program

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:14.565
to share their knowledge and

00:32:14.632 --> 00:32:16.567
experience and benefit from

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:18.636
an additional hand we hope to

00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:20.505
address these issues in the

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:22.273
future traditional grants to

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.842
assist small vineyard and winery

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:27.312
owners to be able to access this

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.048
we did have our first graduate

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:32.016
last spring who is now on an

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:34.085
entrepreneurial track as a

00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:35.753
vineyard consultant for small

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.922
vineyards in our county her

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:39.590
experience in the program was

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:42.060
truly life altering moving

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:44.395
from from a desk job to the

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.097
vineyards where she sees a

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:48.166
horror movie life ahead of her

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.635
her new found skills have also

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:53.004
positively impacted the quality

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:55.440
of grapes from local vineyards

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:57.809
where she has worked I second

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.177
apprentice will graduate in

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:02.013
December we currently have six

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.481
apprentices and will interview

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:04.982
new candidates in the coming

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:07.585
weeks we are expanding our reach

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:08.953
to individuals who will turn

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.488
twenty one during their time

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:12.323
in the apprenticeship those

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:13.658
under twenty ones will be able

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:15.193
to vote on the job training

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:17.128
time to the vineyard and winery

00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:18.930
without tasting of exposure

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:21.432
I program is small but growing

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.735
at a rate so our local vineyards

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:25.703
and wineries can hire newly

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.772
graduated of apprentices as

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:29.741
they are available two minutes

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:31.776
thank you our predecessors

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:33.077
will also be qualified to

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:34.712
continue to a four year college

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:36.714
program if that's their desire

00:33:37.982 --> 00:33:40.385
-- other challenging issues

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:41.719
remain such as the maze of

00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:43.187
different regulations for out

00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:44.589
of state direct to consumer

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:46.257
shipping as well as finding

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.126
the time and gaining expertise

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:49.660
to address the growing numbers

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:51.996
of forms reports and paperwork

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:53.731
required by kind of governmental

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:56.234
agencies now including the FDA

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:57.935
it is difficult to start up

00:33:58.002 --> 00:33:59.237
a new small business of any

00:33:59.303 --> 00:34:01.506
kind let alone one depended

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:03.374
on agriculture there's so

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:04.675
many variables that cannot

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.611
be controlled such as whether

00:34:06.677 --> 00:34:08.780
water shortage vectors plant

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:11.048
disease and natural disasters

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:13.017
such as fire some of these

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:15.153
challenges can be controlled

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:16.988
are changes in government and

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:19.157
regulatory policy such as

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:20.992
reduction of standardization and

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:22.660
or standardization of paperwork

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:24.695
elimination every step redundant

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:26.097
reporting of information to

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.932
different agencies the water

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:30.368
runoff standards standardization

00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:31.969
of federal and state tax rate

00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:33.671
categories for alcohol levels

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.673
and reporting schedules other

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.909
state shipping regulations and

00:34:37.975 --> 00:34:39.844
antiquated regulations regarding

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.746
wine sales and advertising

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:43.748
of wine and winery off site

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:46.551
events another challenge

00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:47.452
is the length of time for

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:48.920
application approval for -- to

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.588
license or modification to a

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.723
current license now six to eight

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.459
months or longer if there any

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:56.227
complications such as simple

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:58.429
clarification information or

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:00.131
delays into police department

00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:01.833
reviews the length of time

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:03.367
for an initial -- to license

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:05.136
to be processed improved is a

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:06.604
major hindrance for wineries

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.306
in general but particularly

00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:10.208
for small family owned wineries

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.310
as wine cannot be made before

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:13.945
production licenses granted

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:15.546
production of red wine takes

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:16.781
up to eighteen months of more

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:18.449
from harvest to market our

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:19.951
colleagues in breweries can

00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:22.587
bring saleable product in thirty

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:24.288
days and wine shops and liquor

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:25.723
stores are just a phone call

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.592
away from their distributor to

00:35:27.658 --> 00:35:30.161
fill their shelves modifications

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:31.829
to existing licenses is also

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:33.631
unlikely process that starts

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:35.166
pretty much from the beginning

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:36.634
rather than a more streamlined

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:39.170
process giving existing license

00:35:39.237 --> 00:35:40.938
data that's currently on file

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.740
with the A. B. C. for example

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.108
a recent application to add

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:45.543
a production component to an

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.678
existing tasting facility took

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:49.714
more than six months we do

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.148
appreciate the recent changes

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:52.483
implemented such as reduce

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.852
federal excise taxes the ability

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:56.821
to have corporate tasting rooms

00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:58.422
hosting more than one winery

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:00.124
and sharing access to tasting

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.059
room space for adjacent wineries

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:04.328
and breweries and closing the

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:05.830
wine industry in San Diego is

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:07.532
a great success story we're

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:09.267
we're still facing a number of

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:11.269
challenges thank you for the

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:13.004
opportunity to share our story

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.139
and concerns thank you so much

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:17.008
miss with billion miss Williams

00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:18.409
very grateful for your testimony

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:19.577
today I know that we're gonna

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:20.645
have questions what we're gonna

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:21.979
do is we're gonna hold questions

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:23.514
until each of our presenters

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.116
have an opportunity with a could

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:26.317
be to turn the floor over now

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:28.252
to take a bath apples with the

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:30.121
California department of alcohol

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:31.322
beverage control Sir thank you

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.657
so much of five to seven minutes

00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:33.958
we're grateful you're here great

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:36.394
thanks center -- I wanna

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.828
I'm gonna touch on three things

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:39.363
just a quick overview of the

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.798
department I'm gonna talk about

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.266
tight house rules and how the

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:44.702
one is you fits into them and

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:47.171
then cover three of the most --

00:36:47.772 --> 00:36:49.507
commonly asked questions of me

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:51.008
in the wine industry in terms

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.476
of some of all being issues

00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:54.912
so quick on the department --

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.514
we have four hundred and fifty

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:58.416
eight employees we had four

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.384
hundred and fifty six employees

00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:01.786
in nineteen fifty five when we

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:02.820
were found it so we've grown

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.622
by two people over the years

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:07.458
government bloat at its worst

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:10.027
right there -- we are about

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:11.729
forty eight percent peace

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:14.599
officers -- who are focused in

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:17.635
around licenses talismans we do

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.971
variety of narcotics and

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:22.940
prostitution and other lots

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:25.176
of underage drinking can focus

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:26.844
in around bars and restaurants

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:28.679
for the most part very few

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.014
prostitution things we've

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.816
done our wineries for example

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:34.485
-- that's we are tough right

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:37.655
any of that so -- then the rest

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:39.690
of us were devoted to licensing

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:42.727
-- and -- assisting the

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:44.595
industry we have two offices

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:46.263
in San Diego right downtown

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:47.798
in the state building and

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:49.867
then also in the city of San

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.036
Marcos -- we have twenty four

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:54.038
offices around the state and our

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.807
our goal is to or regulatory

00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:58.809
philosophy you put it better I

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:01.078
suppose is trying to get good

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:02.980
people in business for trying to

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:04.448
help them stay in business and

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:06.283
comply with the difficult laws

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.519
that they face and we're we're

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:09.987
going to crack down on people

00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:11.756
who make the industry look bad

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:14.558
because they are abusing alcohol

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:16.527
and encouraging others to do so

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.162
and running criminal enterprises

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:20.564
in around our establishments

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:21.999
it's a tiny little group of

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:23.634
people but it's the kind of

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.403
people they can give all of

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.038
our industries of as a bad

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:29.106
name and not something we want

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:31.442
for all the obvious reasons --

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:33.778
the being under the tight house

00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:35.980
issues -- coming out of

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:38.983
prohibition every state adopted

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.718
tied house losses sensually

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.119
divide industry into three

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:44.121
groups manufacturers which would

00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:45.623
be wine makers on wine grape

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.125
growers -- the distributors

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:49.727
and and wholesalers who

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:52.396
essentially take of manufactured

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:54.065
product who then distributed

00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:55.466
to retailers or the third

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:58.569
tears over the years many

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:01.138
many exceptions have grown so

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:03.040
our code has gone from like this

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:05.109
stick to this there -- in every

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.078
single year each of the you

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:09.013
probably have someone who wants

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.848
a tight house exception coming

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:13.517
to your office -- asking

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:15.119
for and why it's a wonderful

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:16.454
idea in a lot of them really are

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.190
wonderful ideas -- but

00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:21.125
it's it's created a situation

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.693
where our laws we have become

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.663
enormously complex traditionally

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.864
distilled spirits are the

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:28.332
most are the most closely

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:29.400
regulated because of their

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:32.269
intoxicating of fact -- beer

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:34.972
next so mostly because of

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.540
the history of how it developed

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:38.909
in prohibition it was really the

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.845
vat and distilled spirits almost

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.213
to a lesser degree were were

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:44.048
some of the biggest concerns

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.616
in terms of abuse of alcohol

00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:46.951
in the beginning of the end of

00:39:47.017 --> 00:39:49.186
the twentieth century arm and

00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:51.322
then wine has a special place

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:53.791
and even though in some ways the

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:55.793
laws of the most complex related

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.828
to wine it's because you really

00:39:57.895 --> 00:39:59.163
have the most exceptions from

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.865
the tide health system right

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:03.167
so you can actually operate as

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.369
distributors you can distribute

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:06.637
your own lines you can just

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.005
read other people's winds

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:10.307
most manufacturers are either

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:12.209
not allowed to hold retail

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:15.446
licenses at all or with rarely

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:17.748
very narrow exceptions wine

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:20.251
makers actually can hold --

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:22.386
retail licenses in a variety

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:25.055
of forms with some limitations

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:26.490
but generally you can operate

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:29.226
restaurants -- and you can

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:30.694
operate off sale you can

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:32.963
operate liquor stores a again

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.866
with with with various --

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.369
-- exceptions and rules apply

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:39.870
to them but I think that's

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:41.639
largely the the exceptions for

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:43.774
one have largely been because

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:45.342
it's been let it was less of

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:46.877
a concern in terms of alcohol

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:49.079
abuse historically and then

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:50.447
your industry has just done a

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.983
fabulous job of promoting itself

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.019
and promoting wind as food and

00:40:55.085 --> 00:40:56.654
part of lifestyle as opposed

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.822
to something that's primarily

00:40:57.888 --> 00:41:00.324
intoxicating that is a huge

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:02.493
achievement for California wine

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.728
-- it's something the A. B. C.

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:06.997
supports and it's something

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:08.332
that you need to preserve and

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:11.068
continue always important to

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:13.737
emphasize the value and what

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:15.773
you do and what you bring to

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.409
California -- the other to

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.578
the other -- parts of the

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:21.912
manufacturing sector certain

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:23.380
sector of not traditionally been

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:25.583
as effective but but they're

00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:27.284
getting their rights so craft

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:29.520
beer for example ten years

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:32.256
ago Joe off pretty fledgling

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:34.925
industry and now largely due to

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.927
pioneers in San Diego actually

00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:39.730
-- huge part of a lifestyle

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.999
as opposed to just alcohol as

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:44.168
a commodity right and distilled

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.570
spirits are are starting to come

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:48.772
along there's a crafty still

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:51.108
movement in California that is

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.910
still in its relatively nascent

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:55.279
stages but -- there is a mention

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:56.780
of the joint tasting rooms with

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:59.183
beer and wine and thanks to ms

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.885
act we are curry there will now

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.486
be craft distillers in their

00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:03.721
group so you're now going to

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:06.056
have these up potential for

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:08.025
some really fantastic locations

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:10.160
where you're going to have the

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:11.829
three core three types of our

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:14.598
call with craft orientation

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:16.066
there's a place in Sacramento

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:17.601
right now to is developing a

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:18.535
space like that and they're

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:20.070
gonna have also all these craft

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:22.006
kitchens along with it so here

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:24.174
is small business at its best

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:25.643
here is an ability to actually

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:27.378
bring us all together in a way

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:30.247
that promotes again California

00:42:30.314 --> 00:42:33.183
food lifestyle and the place of

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.419
alcohol in that in incredibly

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:37.288
responsible and and forward

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:38.789
looking way so that is that is

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:41.692
great -- other things

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:42.893
however are a little more

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.596
confusing for wineries such as

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.866
-- marketing right online

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:50.968
marketing that's true for all

00:42:51.035 --> 00:42:53.737
industries very -- it's

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:56.206
a very difficult land say

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.175
to get your arms around

00:42:58.242 --> 00:42:59.443
because there's all kinds

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.079
of prohibitions on primarily

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:03.547
retailers and manufacturers

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:05.416
advertising together to me

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.817
we've made of right we've made

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:08.519
a variety of exceptions their

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:10.554
winemaker dinners there's the

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:12.256
abilities of wine makers to

00:43:12.323 --> 00:43:13.958
provide tastings at retail

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:16.694
outlets -- but again this

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.662
goes back to the the history

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:20.197
of tied house in the sense

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:22.766
that one of the evils of of

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:24.835
-- of the alcohol industry

00:43:24.902 --> 00:43:26.704
prior prohibition was

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:29.306
pumping cheap alcohol all

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:32.109
kinds advertising it to be

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:35.179
primarily poor communities and

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.947
creating tremendous alcohol

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:38.582
abuse problems so those

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:41.352
laws still exists today and

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:43.921
and we need to take a better

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:45.622
look though at how they're

00:43:45.689 --> 00:43:47.257
changing and evolving in ways

00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:48.993
that actually make work don't

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:51.261
encourage access a good example

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:52.963
just plain social media right

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.332
so right now you can post

00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:56.800
the names of retailers so

00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:59.036
they can find your wine but

00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:01.672
you can't allow anyone to then

00:44:01.939 --> 00:44:03.807
take a picture of themselves

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:05.542
out a retailer and post on

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:07.711
your website and now it has to

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:09.613
do with prohibitions between

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.615
a about the ability of a

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:13.450
manufacturer to advertise for

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:15.452
retailers not really what was

00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:18.355
intended -- and something

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:19.623
we should be looking at to

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.392
make that less confusing more

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:23.961
intuitive for people but but

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:25.729
if someone of the nature of

00:44:25.796 --> 00:44:26.930
the tide health system in the

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:29.366
exceptions have been made --

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.502
it's just complicated but were

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:33.570
really there to help people get

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:35.406
in front of that if you have

00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:36.807
challenges in your industry

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:38.142
should come talk to us we can

00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:39.510
find solutions for you because

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:41.178
are you generally ways to make

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:43.147
things work the don't raise

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:44.348
those kinds of concerns for

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.550
us -- as a secondary I want

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:47.785
to mention in terms of all

00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:48.952
being issues of concern to

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.287
the industry all of our call

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.623
industry is by twenty twenty

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:54.124
one you're gonna have to have

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.759
all the servers in your tasting

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:57.828
rooms trained in responsible

00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.530
beverage service that's going

00:44:59.596 --> 00:45:01.331
to be true for all servers in

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:03.600
all aspects of the industry

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:05.736
in California we estimate it's

00:45:05.803 --> 00:45:06.970
anywhere between eight hundred

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:09.273
thousand a million people which

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:11.442
is really -- just a staggering

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:12.976
number but it just goes to show

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.945
the size of our hospitality

00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:17.614
industry -- it if the law

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.349
rose out of a terrible thing

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:20.617
that actually Kerr down here

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:22.586
on a camp Pendleton a marine

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:25.255
gotten this car and it really

00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:26.890
really drunk anyone often he

00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:28.992
killed three medical students

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.694
and critically injured another

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:33.197
one -- and so what out

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:34.398
of that effort was the kind of

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:36.033
thing that really pushed over

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.601
the efforts to have responsible

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:38.869
beverage service has a right

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:39.870
now though we're developing

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:41.138
regulations were trying to

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:42.639
make it as easy for you as

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:44.541
possible we know you have to

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:46.743
keep track of tons and tons of

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.378
government requirements we're

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:49.580
trying to make an automated

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:51.448
system for you that'll minimize

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:53.584
the administrative slash

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.452
bureaucratic burden and then

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:56.420
the final thing I just want

00:45:56.487 --> 00:45:58.722
to mention is cannabis --

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:00.491
lots of lots of stories in

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:01.625
the news all the time about

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:02.860
people putting cannabis and

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.995
whine about people having wine

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:07.498
and Candice pairing dinners --

00:46:07.564 --> 00:46:10.534
all that is entirely unlawful

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:13.504
-- the the statutes are clear

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.506
that you can have cannabis now

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:16.907
call together which got to do

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:18.208
in the privacy your own home

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.577
you cannot have it in any public

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:23.514
establishment -- what I would

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.948
say about the stories about

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:26.750
cannabis and wine cannabis and

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:28.619
beer cannabis now culturally the

00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:31.155
tend to be a little over blown

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:33.090
in the sense that for every

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:34.958
ten complaints we get we go out

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:37.127
look at -- maybe one anyone's

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:38.162
actually doing something

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:39.363
so I think the industry has

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.597
been really responsible I

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:41.899
think they understand that

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:43.734
probably not a good long term

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.802
business model to mix these two

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:49.206
narcotics in essence together

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:51.441
and keep them separate so we're

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:52.709
we're really trying to provide

00:46:52.776 --> 00:46:54.778
people guidance -- some in

00:46:54.845 --> 00:46:56.246
the industry of come with to

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.215
us with ideas about de alkyl

00:46:58.282 --> 00:47:00.217
alcohol Ising things there are

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:01.518
ways to do that if that's what

00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:02.819
you want to do and make it

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:05.189
legal again we're here to help

00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:06.356
you on that but generally our

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:07.858
philosophy is cannabis now call

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:09.927
should be separate so thank you

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:11.762

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:12.629

so talk about the association of

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:12.923

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.458
new wine dinner is anyone is all

across the country doing these

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:19.596
wind and as I got back home and

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:20.864
I was really excited one day

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:22.232
and I says the national us you

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:23.967

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:25.002
here and she's is what you're

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.803
talking about a so you know just

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.705
got to swing into North Carolina

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:30.474
Alabama and Texas and there

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.576
was no African Americans in my

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:35.712
dinner I'm Anne my Danish

00:48:36.113 --> 00:48:37.447
and she looked at me and she

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:39.850
says well hunting there's not

00:48:39.916 --> 00:48:41.952
any in California Inyo dinner

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.688
so it got me to thinking

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:47.257
about you know why so

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:49.459
talk to a couple buddies in two

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.928
thousand and two thousand and I

00:48:51.995 --> 00:48:54.631
kept going talking about it and

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:55.732
I got together with some guys

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.734
and we start at the association

00:48:57.801 --> 00:48:59.770
of African Americans in the

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:02.039
nation yes folks it's not a

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:04.107
black thing yesterday more

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:06.343
people's to drink wine quite

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.779
frankly I don't care who won

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:10.280
a drink I just want people

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:11.982
to enjoy a glass of wine

00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:14.918
so I put together this group

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:17.087
with the idea that we're

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:18.922
going to spend time in the

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:21.525
African American community to

00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.361
talk about why and

00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:25.729
consumption of wine and I think

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:27.931
you put it very bluntly here

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:30.233
not red fox report not that type

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.902
of stuff when I'm talking about

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:33.937
you know Ryan did you can enjoy

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:36.707
on a daily basis or weekly

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:37.874
basis will every other day or

00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:40.243
whatever you I and I looked

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.345
at it I thought the wind was

00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:43.513
really small business back

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.414
when I was really getting

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:45.649
going at this stuff really

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:47.417
snobby it was kind of a little

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:49.519
actually and I'm just going

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:51.288
to give you my opinion I

00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:53.623
don't care if you have with

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:55.459
eighteen point five Zinfandel

00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:56.893
which will catfish topical

00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:59.062
issue -- money to spend

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:03.834
with that concept -- we

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.435
started this group and we

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:07.170
do things that can Harlem

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:11.007
of Philadelphia south

00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:13.677
Dallas one is points

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:15.278
throughout the country to

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:17.414
get more African American to

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:19.750
appreciate wine it is a five

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:22.285
oh one C. six organization

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:25.055
and bass -- what the mission

00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:26.623
of the organization is to get

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.825
more folks understand line I'm a

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:31.628
great grow -- and I'm economic

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:33.930
bottom line and I want to take

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:35.699
that information that I have

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.033
along with the other members of

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.269
the association and share that

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:41.104
information with others who

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:42.873
are trying to get into the wind

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:45.041
business now some time you may

00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:47.744
reach up and it says -- mac and

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.146
the other African American have

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:51.715
to work harder to accomplish

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.417
their goals I don't agree with

00:50:53.483 --> 00:50:54.718
that I think anybody in this

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.019
business you better be able

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.854
to work hard I don't care who

00:50:57.921 --> 00:51:00.056
you are high small you on big

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:02.659
your you gotta work real hard

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:03.593
you may have to work a little

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.662
bit harder -- as a small and

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:08.298
wondering -- because of the

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:10.267
challenge for the association

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:12.736
of American business is how

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.372

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:02.619
lot of expense in a lot of

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:04.721
-- cost you you know to help

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.456
you build your brand so the

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:08.024
idea that I'm trying to do

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:09.493
with the association is come

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:11.761
together as a group and then

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:14.464
all for these distributors

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:16.199
you know thirty forty

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:17.534
thousand cases are wrong and

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.535
then they may want to put

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:20.937
some effort like has market

00:52:21.004 --> 00:52:23.139
aligned with a lot of

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:26.610
us Senate on yeah I want

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:28.845
to hear nine and June

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:32.148
-- and that's a social but --

00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:33.783
you know when slow was felt

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.118
that they were kind of free

00:52:35.185 --> 00:52:36.286
and I kind of keep that in

00:52:36.353 --> 00:52:39.189
mind just to have withdrawal

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:41.024
-- we also put non aligned

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:43.393
cam this summer we've been

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.128
able in the past to send some

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:47.797
student Chau -- you know

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:49.366
for those troops middle class

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:51.001
is just about perfect okay

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:53.003
but there are other colleges

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:54.504
and I'm working with you know

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:56.573

moderation over to where

00:53:00.243 --> 00:53:01.845
you can go to those classes

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.346
and learning about wine and

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:05.181

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:07.284

know I don't know that that's

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:14.691
what we thought may compress

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:17.060
drummer could ripple and done

00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:18.395

up to the committee to be able

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:44.955

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:45.922

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:48.024
like to be able leaders saw I'll

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:49.192
be more than happy to do that

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.894
our culture so I'm gonna ask

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:52.896
a couple questions -- Linda I

00:53:53.363 --> 00:53:54.598
really appreciate you telling me

00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:57.233
before we met earlier and also

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:59.269
express -- well how you work

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:01.371
with UC Davis online classes

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.440
I was not aware of that and I

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:05.342
live eleven miles from UC Davis

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:07.110
so could you show just a little

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:09.746
bit -- how that works do you --

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.381
you know I was just thinking a

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.617
Mister macdonald is a good way

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:15.151
for maybe some of his people to

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:16.419
be interested in getting into

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:17.988
wine is being able to use the

00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:20.190
online -- classes and I think

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:21.758
that's really -- so how that

00:54:21.825 --> 00:54:23.893
work well it works is that

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:25.962
you know we require the the

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:28.164
the person to go to the class

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:29.566
now we didn't do this stuff

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:32.135
for start go to the class once

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:33.536
they complete a class then

00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:34.971
we reimburse that money back

00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:37.941
because you know we we did just

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.643
want to pay somebody some money

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:40.577
and they decide they want to

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:42.646
go to class so that's that's

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:44.381
how how that works but what

00:54:44.447 --> 00:54:46.783
we we found in the past that

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:49.185
it is very very hard to find

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.421
you know African Americans in

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:53.289
a position to even attend those

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:55.825
classes because the the kind

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:57.794
of friend of the business --

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.963
overall -- when I do these

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.798
classes and all these community

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:02.832
they think this is still a

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:05.035
snobby gaming so when we got

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:07.070
all the chain that snob in this

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:08.972
is a wine and that's what I

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:10.974
go to the philosophy is your

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:12.742
money and whatever you want to

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.577
have with your line that's your

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:16.146
money you spent the way you want

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:18.348
Linda how do you do

00:55:18.415 --> 00:55:19.616
the apprentice approach

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:20.984
apprenticeship program as well

00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:22.819
okay a let us start with the

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:25.455
UC Davis op which was is a

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:27.991
wonderful resource for all of us

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:30.760
-- it is the nationally

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.562
and internationally -- the

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.664
online program they have is

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.032
is the one makers certificate

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:38.802
program -- which is out

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:39.969
a wonderful vehicle for

00:55:40.036 --> 00:55:42.439
people who yes such as myself

00:55:42.939 --> 00:55:45.608
living not near UC Davis having

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:48.111
a job and family at home --

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:50.013
to be able to access that

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.147
knowledge and information

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:52.682
through the on line venue

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:54.551
and and the subsequent chat

00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:56.019
sessions that go with that with

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:58.354
that fellow class members and

00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:00.590
then you people from all over

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:03.026
the world -- is part of that

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.029
-- class that you can exchange

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:08.698
ideas and information and

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.867
and really develop some some

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:12.402
friendships that way too so

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:14.838
I I was if -- if should

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:17.674
we travel to Chile Argentina

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:20.643
as we could I could email

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.378
one of my classmates and we

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:24.347
can connect up and so you build

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:26.316
some collegiality there as well

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:28.518
is as it being a wonderful --

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:31.087
source of information -- those

00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:32.989
classes for that why makers

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:34.491
to the care program are fairly

00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:37.460
pricey -- but the but

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.629
you pay for it did the ease of

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.965
accessibility for that I think

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:44.033
other venues where people can

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.668
get similar information would

00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:48.404
be -- currently through

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:51.107
-- such as sat San Diego State

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:52.776
University has in town here

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:55.245
has a program for wine business

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:57.747
and they go they look at the

00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:59.249
business aspect of that starting

00:56:59.315 --> 00:57:00.884
to integrate a couple of

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.453
hands on classes -- with

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.255
a little bit of information and

00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:07.323
exposure to wind production but

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.025
then again our community college

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:11.961
system -- is is really

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:14.297
I think that pretty much the hot

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:17.734
bed for ease of accessibility

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:20.103
-- both in distance and in

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.906
expense -- and that's that's

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:25.241
what -- our apprenticeship

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:28.111
program is working to to

00:57:28.178 --> 00:57:30.346
build into besides having the

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:32.382
apprenticeship itself to start

00:57:32.448 --> 00:57:34.951
building in viticulture and

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:36.986
wine production classes one of

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:38.454
our community colleges mayor

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:41.191
coast up in in north county --

00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:42.859
has had a one production and

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:44.060
that a culture class there for

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:46.396
a number of years now and --

00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:49.566
they they they are regularly

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:51.568
full classes so it there there

00:57:51.634 --> 00:57:53.670
is a need beyond people that

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:55.271
are looking for the work force

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:57.740
-- in the wine industry here

00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:59.742
we have quite a number a large

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:02.245
number of home wine makers home

00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:05.114
backyard wine grape growers who

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:07.217
who really have some substantial

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:09.819
-- he cringed at the plant

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.821
their own grapes and make their

00:58:11.888 --> 00:58:13.690
own wine and and always want

00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:16.025
to learn more too so I think --

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:17.594
we have lots of accessibility

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.995
for people on all levels

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:21.965
with millions of the complaints

00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:23.466
at travel Smith did you are

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:24.534
chairman of this one as well

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:26.903
that's okay okay center dot

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:30.506
so I've got one for you

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:33.776
Smith OB you talked about the

00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:36.112
complexity of of of the the

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.114
rules and regulations of a

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.316
that I think the the -- the of

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:41.818
people here would be interested

00:58:41.885 --> 00:58:43.386
in hearing what you do

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:46.356
to -- -- inform

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:49.359
licensees of new rules and

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:52.395
regulations or existing or

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:55.365
what could existing licensees

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:57.567
due to stay up on it themselves

00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:01.070
so new regulations we

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:03.840
really don't have because we

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:05.008
don't have a right we haven't

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:06.609
had a regulatory unit many

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:09.279
years so we've sort of call

00:59:09.345 --> 00:59:11.114
them out here and there it's

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.749
really something that is

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:14.284
lacking I think that in this

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:16.753
coming budget year -- we're

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:19.022
gonna probably get the funding

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:20.256
to do that because there's a

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:22.759
lot of things we could do --

00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:24.794
proactively that would actually

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.362
be beneficial for the industry

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:29.032
unlike most regulatory agencies

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:31.301
-- our regulations are less

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:32.702
designed to stop people from

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:34.270
doing things that actually to

00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:36.439
help them do things because

00:59:36.506 --> 00:59:38.775
in California law you can't

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.176
do anything unless there's a

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:42.078
statute that's been California

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:43.613
alcohol you cannot do anything

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.281
lesser stature rule that says

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:47.283
you can so like with the social

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.685
media I think there's lots of

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:49.819
things we could put in place

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:51.254
would make that workable for

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:53.656
them -- but in terms of issues

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:54.457
where we think things are

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:56.292
difficult we do issue industry

00:59:56.359 --> 00:59:58.861
advisories so we've been -- as

00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.697
the as the statues have a vault

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.665
that we have -- been issuing

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:04.100
advisories on cannabis for

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.735
example just to make it really

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:08.137
clear you cannot do virtually

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:10.606
anything on an alcohol premise

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:12.508
with cannabis and vice versa

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:15.845
-- we also -- are make ourselves

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:19.015
available -- to licensees --

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:21.284
particularly we we can't just

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:22.618
give day today advice but as

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:23.820
particularly when there is

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:25.388
issues that are impacting the

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.991
industry -- we try to work with

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:29.492
them and then let the industry

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.327
groups no we work really closely

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:32.495
with the one is to with the

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:34.397
family wine growers and then

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:35.898
we're also really excess will

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.367
come talking to people servi

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.335
time I'm at one of these things

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.870
I always say I will come speak

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:42.438
to your group if you want me to

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:44.841
-- and I actually did that in

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:47.477
-- -- house a roll bliss and

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:48.711
I'm gonna be in Monterey to

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.613
speak to the Monterey vendors

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.181
next month so that's something

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:54.317
that's really great because

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.219
we can put out information but

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:57.787
also we we just learned a ton

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.489
of stuff right every time we

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:00.690
go out and we're in the field

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:03.092
actually talk to people so so

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:04.727
take to the long way of getting

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:07.196
to we do as much as we can we

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:08.398
should we should we're we're

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:09.999
not institutionally set up to

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:11.934
be a systematic as we should

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:13.102
and that's something we're

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.271
working on I

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:18.941
think it's transit issue

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:21.244
questions comments please

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.146
mentally of a really quick --

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:25.882
my district includes fall broke

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:28.551
pama valley center Escondido

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:30.420
parts of simple school family

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:33.356
in San Diego county which

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.158
we're seeing more more people

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:37.727
getting into growing grapes

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.262
and when I had attended the

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:41.064
San Diego vintners association

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.899
meeting a little while back

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.600
-- I remember one of the

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:45.635
things that came up because

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:46.736
more and more people cutting

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:47.703
down the row of a kind of

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:48.871
trees and now starting the

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:50.506
plan vineyards because of

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.775
the cost of water especially

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:55.411
I'm and I I remember and I

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:56.612
don't remember all of it but

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.614
the vendor's association is

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:00.416
very active in helping people

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.718
figure out how to navigate

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:05.188
you know setting up their winery

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:07.256
coming out to visit them can

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:08.658
you speak a little bit about

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:10.827
that like how you encourage

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.595
people when they have you know

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.896
an interest in starting up

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:16.466
in your well that's one

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.835
thing that we that's that's

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.603
a real positive about being part

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.038
of San Diego county veterans

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:24.440
association is because we are

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:25.908
spread all over the county

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:27.376
there's somebody that's going

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:29.679
to be next door who wants

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:31.147
to start up or just thinking

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.316

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:45.094
to others that may be able to

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.762
help give additional help and

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:49.465
support -- but we're we're

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:52.869
very -- supportive association

and and work cooperatively

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.771
together to try to to make

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.473
these things happen we also

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.709
bring in outside speakers

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:01.577
-- experts in their field to

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:03.746
talk about -- putting in

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:06.549
vineyards and add vineyard S.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.651

and and wineries up because

01:03:10.753 --> 01:03:13.456
I mission is to make sure

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:15.258
that aye wineries in San Diego

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:17.093
county are making it the best

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:19.795
wine that we can and keep

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:21.264
moving that toward increasing

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.899
quality and and having

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:25.935
people have a real positive

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:27.236
experience streaking San

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:30.239
Diego winds and seek them out

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:32.975
to hope I answered your question

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:36.546
I wanna thank you to the

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.247
panelists for a great testimony

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:39.949
to this not might for tech this

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:41.017
is not my area of expertise

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:42.618
but -- but yeah I mean all you

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:43.786
adding really human element to

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:45.388
help books of myself understand

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:46.889
-- we don't have you experience

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.191
is an industry actually the

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:49.091
question for the doctor if

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:50.526
I may and nobody puts on a

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:51.627
taught in a tough spot I know

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:52.628
because sometimes be difficult

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:55.198
Astarte directors like nature

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:55.965
of your business you're kind

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.400
of generally in those right I

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:58.467
just wanna make the observation

01:03:58.534 --> 01:03:59.835
in my district offices in our

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.204
state building here in San Diego

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.338
I see many of your staff that

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:03.706
worked extremely hard they're

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.074
very responsive to my district

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.209
staff us some of whom are here

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.177
today -- on issues of great

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.078
concern we have about alcohol

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:10.413
consumption in the seventy eight

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.914
gas and district Pacific beach

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:14.116
north park -- I know oftentimes

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.918
it that is initially felt by

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.687
-- make it how Californians

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:18.487
who may have complaints or

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.256
concerns of from a budgetary

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:21.724
perspective what would you hope

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:22.892
that we could advocate for as

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:23.859
legislators I know there's a

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.228
lot of calm conversations within

01:04:25.294 --> 01:04:26.462
the caucus on what we have is

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:27.897
party you sort of alluded to it

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.532
but he put a finer point on what

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:31.000
we do from resources you think

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.468
would be helpful -- to making

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.337
sure the department can be --

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:35.404
with the with the to the workers

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:36.405
who are clearly working really

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:37.840
hard -- are well supported

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.108
answered the constituents that

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:40.343
we serve field was supported

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:42.245
by the department as well --

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:44.413
so so are our biggest challenge

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.216
has been -- really modernizing

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.318
our electronic services we

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.120
finally got money to go through

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:53.656
the state approval processes

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.992
to to have online payments

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.594
-- to have online applications

01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:00.997
-- to provide industry industry

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.365
members with information

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:03.966
that's automated and members

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:05.635
of prevention community one

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:07.403
understand what's going on of

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.505
right now we process a hundred

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:12.008
and fifty thousand personal

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:14.477
physical touch paper checks a

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:16.479
year because we can't accept

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.281
electronic payment which is

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:21.083
just embarrassing at annoying

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.918
in a Paris and center on so I

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.287
think we're on the right road to

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:27.156
that -- but we also

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.158
just on the enforcement level

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:30.793
-- we're trying to automated

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.794
some of that to make it more

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.195
efficient we just don't we just

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.865
don't have enough people --

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:37.099
but but I I don't want to sound

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.901
like a typical you know state

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:40.102
bureaucrat always complains

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:41.871
about resources but I I really

01:05:41.937 --> 01:05:43.406
do think finally we've gained

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.741
some traction with our control

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:47.677
agencies because as I said at

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:48.778
the outset you know we have

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:50.446
to more people than we had in

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:52.848
nineteen fifty five and we

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.617
have now you know about three

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:55.718
times as many people in the

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.086
state and more than twice as

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:58.587
many licenses so we're really

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:00.323
trying to modernize our balls

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:01.957
I don't think it's that much

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:03.526
bigger than we are it's not

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:05.761
some gigantic growth curve --

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:07.196
but it's really in the areas

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:09.332
of trying to automate mourn for

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:11.767
spent and then some -- field

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:14.303
staff particularly I would say

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:16.806
in San Diego and Los Angeles

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:19.575
where we have -- as no just

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.744
of a very involved community

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.346
we we work for the pro tem

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.715
as well really well -- very

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:27.350
involved community both in terms

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.784
of entrepreneurs but also in

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:30.019
terms of people concerned about

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:32.288
neighborhoods lots of protest

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:34.123
lots of complexity same thing

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.658
in Los Angeles so that's really

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:37.927
what we're trying to get to is

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:40.529
is is us a real

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.298
to think is relatively slight

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:43.866
growth it'll actually modernize

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:46.268
is in a position us to be left

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.237
behind the curve and exits

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:49.405
quick follow up even if you

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.539
on the path to kind of getting

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:51.874
the automation that would be

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:52.808
reflective of the state of

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:55.277
Silicon Valley and -- what would

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:56.879
actually cost to get their image

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.614
on the past but like was how

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.682
much will it takes that sound

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:00.983
like a one time costs are now

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.885
we have a as a seventy five

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:04.987
million dollar annual budget

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:06.889
and what we've real what we're

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:08.624
projecting that out to be is

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.792
really in the neighborhood of

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.427
about a million dollars so it's

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:13.329
it's it's not huge dollars it's

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:15.898
just -- we we've just been

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:17.166
as you know everyone in state

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:18.334
government have been relatively

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:20.636
Oster austere is that authorizes

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.838
that on money an author on

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:25.341
no but it will be we we've

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:26.842
gotten to the project we're now

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:28.043
going to have numbers that come

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.812
out of that stage to the power

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.981
process sorry for anyone outside

01:07:32.047 --> 01:07:33.315
of Sacramento doesn't know

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:34.717
what powers but it's the state

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.652
approval process for project so

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:37.820
we will have a budget come out

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.121
about that we hope is going to

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:40.823
make it into the January budget

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.491
okay please keep us posted I

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:43.726
spend any happy advocate for

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:44.994
that the budget process step

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:46.328
and keep very much when your

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:47.596
comments and I have all those

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:48.597
communities are very active

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:49.598
in concerned by neighborhoods

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:50.633
never ever going to complain

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.067
about a wine -- bar so thank

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:53.302
you to the industry for being

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:55.037
good actors and and and risk

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.338
the neighborhoods where -- this

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:57.873
is often a sense of such a big

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:00.976
the switch is quick question

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:02.878
-- Mister director when you

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.880
take it take a look at wineries

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:06.115
and now they're looking at

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:07.650
additional revenue input into

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.919
looking at -- developing spirits

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:12.655
on -- with a different license

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:14.490
so you have one family that may

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:16.158
be operating a winery and then

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:18.861
also -- establishing a business

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.996
that is running spirits and then

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.765
they have a spirit club like

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:23.766
they want to be able to have a

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.234
wine club but they can't ship

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.002
spirits like they can ship wine

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:29.271
in state any thoughts on that

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:32.508
-- well they can ship spirits in

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:34.610
the state -- not to a club at

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:35.945
the mall right well that's right

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:38.781
-- that is something that

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:40.749
-- I I don't act to tell you

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:41.884
that you have not really looked

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.353
at it closely but there are --

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.822
there are generally what work

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:49.391
just concerned about mostly is

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:52.161
-- is that with with spirits

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:54.663
that -- we were just

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:55.764
not putting them in the hands

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:57.399
of minors etcetera people should

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.168
not have them sure I'm spirits

01:08:59.235 --> 01:09:00.636
also just have had a much

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.238
more traditional distribution

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:04.640
system notes largely because

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.909
of the potential danger of of

01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:10.112
spirits that are -- are

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:11.647
poisonous for lack of a better

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:12.615
way to put it there's a good

01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:14.850
reason why one of the one of

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.685
the best things about the three

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.387
tier system is we just don't

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:19.889
have a lot of alcohol poisoning

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:22.558
based on -- defective alcohol

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:24.593
in this country and one of the

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.161
arguments for that is that we

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:27.329
actually have a distribution

01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:30.733
system that prevents retailers

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.902
from getting -- tainted

01:09:32.968 --> 01:09:35.371
alcohol now but direct shipment

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:36.405
of course is another thing

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:38.107
altogether but I think that I

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:40.876
also in individual right now in

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.311
a at will belabor the point and

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:43.546
go off line on this but if if

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.080
I wanted if I belong to a spear

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:47.249
club though like a wine club I

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:48.984
can go in and buy for example

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:51.687
four to six bottles and walk out

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:53.923
with them -- but

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:55.457
I can't get a mailed to my house

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:58.193
so that's just -- a piece --

01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.995
if your club -- but anyway it's

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:01.697
it's it's a conversation for

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:03.666
another day do understand should

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:04.967
be anything you're hearing on

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.335
the federal level that's one

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:07.202
of the biggest challenges that

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:08.971
we hear from vendors shipping

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.873
out of state I'm in it is

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.541
become incredibly challenging

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:14.710
with UPS and fed ex except ra

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:15.844
anything you're hearing on the

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.746
federal level that -- will there

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:20.549
currently is a challenge to --

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:22.017
to the titles laws that in the

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:24.019
U. S. Supreme Court that may

01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:25.788
actually change the way some

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:27.856
of this works I am myself --

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:29.491
defendant just by virtue of my

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.560
position of case in Sacramento

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:33.062
were an out of state shippers

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:34.797
trying to ship in the California

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.665
and ways that we don't allow

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:38.701
their trying to ship one --

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:40.235
the the part of the problem

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:42.304
of course is that under the

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:43.572
twenty first amendment states

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:44.707
can do whatever they want they

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:45.975
don't have to allow shipping at

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:48.711
all or they can restricted

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.579
anywhere they want the ability

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:52.781
to actually standardized out

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.617
is probably not something the

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:56.452
federal government can impose

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:58.187
what would be a better approach

01:10:58.253 --> 01:10:59.154
would be to try to get the

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:00.489
state's to actually come to

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:01.657
agreements themselves to make

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:03.359
it simpler so that we don't

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:05.327
have to go through middle men

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:07.596
who are specialists to take

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:09.999
away a lot of your money by by

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.233
being in the business of that

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.502
because especially with wine

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:15.904
again not a product were is much

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:17.239
concerned about the safety of

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:19.108
the product that as we are with

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.876
spirits and told to a slightly

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.978
lesser degree here thank you

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:24.847
so much stricter just two last

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.849
questions -- madam chair Mister

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:28.884
chair is a to miss make Williams

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.686
and then -- Smith Donald can

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:31.920
you just give us an overview

01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:33.656
Q. Sealy -- is your when you

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.224
for example like a custom crush

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:36.759
facility where you're buying

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:39.061
fruit are you buying just use

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.029
would love to be a they give

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:41.597
us a quick overview on that

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:44.833
-- and -- your your operation

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:46.101
and then Mister Donald if you

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:48.303
can just give us a -- overview

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:50.005
in California how many African

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:51.206
American wine makers would

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:52.508
you say there are here in

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:53.976
California even if it's in a

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.078
total -- as well as those who

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.813
are -- involved in growing

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.982
as well please Mr claims --

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:01.817
except as well winery and

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:05.688
we buy grapes and

01:12:05.754 --> 01:12:07.923
and do all the the question

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.092
manufactured production in are

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:13.462
bonded licensed facility --

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:15.998
and I believe that that is

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:18.333
the the operating procedure for

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.736
most wineries in the county at

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:23.605
as opposed to say a custom crash

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:27.509
-- AB as more small

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:31.447
backyard growers are

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:33.082
joining together with their

01:12:33.148 --> 01:12:35.050
friends and neighbors I think

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:36.218
they're starting to advance

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:37.486
to a point where they are

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:38.987
looking for something such

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:41.490
as a a custom crush facility

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.792
-- to process their fruitful

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:45.561
for themselves their and their

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:47.930
group so I I believe that is

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:50.599
at in expanded market here in

01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:52.868
in the county I can think of

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:56.805
one the two wineries that are

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:58.640
are working towards that are

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.275
planning to work towards that it

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.745
at this time so I I think that's

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:04.980
going to be a growing area for

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.615
us here in San Diego as well

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.587
Turkish a question about after

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.088
American growers gonna give you

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:14.823
an estimate about twenty five

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.893
-- -- who are wineries

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:20.095
in as about thirty years so --

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:22.598
growers with real small growers

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:24.600
you know for example you know

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:25.934
Michelle and I you know we

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.569
we we just from about twelve

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:30.305
acres of up a PMR approaches

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:31.940
are most my print from other

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.475
growers I like it that way

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.576
because I don't have all of my

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:37.279
aches and wind up you know so --

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:40.015
we -- we -- we think the

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:43.318
-- lan as you know and

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.087
Sonoma napa county is really

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:47.556
really expensive and and

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:49.158
-- post everyone in this room

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:50.626
can say lets you have a whole

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:51.827
pocket full of money you know

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.328
this is a tough business to

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:55.664
last two days and then plan in

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:57.432
a payment could four years or

01:13:57.499 --> 01:13:58.901
so before you get anything off

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.435
of it if you getting hit off of

01:14:00.502 --> 01:14:02.671
it and you can make world class

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:03.939
wine but you got to sell it so

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.307
it takes a lot of dollars to

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:07.376
get into that so collectively

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:08.544
what we trying to do is come

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:09.778
together so we can help each

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.647
other out and help the wine

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.248
industry on the to save time so

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:15.384
that's the best dressed to go

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:17.886
look around and look at all the

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:20.022
stuff is going on mowing the

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.558
folks popping up in that is

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:24.159

great to be here so good morning

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:56.244
-- I guess I'm a talk a

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:57.946
little bit about some of the

01:16:58.013 --> 01:17:00.315
challenges were facing it really

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.851
relates to small business in

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.920
direct to consumer shipping

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:05.921
and I know this is such a

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:08.357
pond earlier the bottom

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:10.959
line is every single state

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:13.962
in our country has a different

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.832
set of rules permits and

01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:18.133
regulations for shipping

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.368
wine into their state

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:22.971
for direct to consumers

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:26.174
if you want to ship wholesale

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:27.509
into their state and have your

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:29.277
one distributed to the state

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:32.414
that's another set of rules

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:35.550
regulations permits registering

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:39.454
if you were just to try to file

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:42.391
literally permits in every

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:44.259
state that allow shipping into

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.128
in the United States it would

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:47.796
be about fifteen thousand

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:50.065
dollars out of your pocket

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:53.135
just to get the permit is

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:56.371
then you will have to do up to

01:17:57.739 --> 01:18:00.475
for reports per year

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:03.612
per state the compliance

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:05.113
work is an absolute

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.849
night so that being

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.352
said it was brought up

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.454
earlier I to use readership

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.791
veto shipper is kind of a god

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.426
send because veto shipper is

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.194
a third party shipper that

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:21.329
literally garner's all of those

01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:24.533
permits in all of the states

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.569
that allow shipping to

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:29.438
and they add as they can as

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:31.873
they become available for

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.275
a small fee it it actually

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:34.476
is a fairly small fee I

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.745
believe it's four seventy

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:39.581
five order and seventy five

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:42.184
cents per bottle is their feet

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:45.120
in essence they become

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:48.023
your distributor they

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:51.426
distribute your wine and

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.929
it's kinda cool I moved I have

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:55.330
a little bit of web background

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:58.200
you build a store there appears

01:18:58.266 --> 01:18:59.401
on your website that looks

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:01.970
like your website through code

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:03.705
you're not really making the

01:19:03.772 --> 01:19:06.241
sale very making the sale

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:09.411
so they're taking the

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.046
order they're taking the

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:12.848
revenue and their depositing

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.883
in your account your portion

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:16.651
minus their fee every two

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:19.187
weeks so they're kind of a

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:20.989
god send but there are things

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:22.791
on the horizon there are

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:24.893
going to make it difficult

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.895
for all of us especially small

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:29.764
business year is a new

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:33.702
all on line age verification

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:36.505
law there is more

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.840
than just today you can't

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:41.176
sign for wine if you're under

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:43.578
twenty one periods on every

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:45.347
box it goes out you have to pay

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:47.048
the additional fee to whoever

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:48.583
using to get the signature

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.486
there's a new law that is asking

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:53.288
for the age to be verified

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:55.357
at the point of sale online

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.060
that's software starts at around

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:01.463
seven to nine thousand dollars

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:05.300
I can't afford that the

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:07.669
what that's going to do that's

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:09.337
going to give veto should

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:11.673
for they're going to have to

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:12.707
purchase it because they're

01:20:12.774 --> 01:20:14.409
making the sales but then that

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:15.810
obviously trickles down to the

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:17.679
smaller wineries and we're gonna

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:19.214
our fees are going to go off

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:23.485
so there's that's making

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:25.120
it difficult for direct to

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:27.022
consumer sales in general

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:28.823
and not everybody knows

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:31.259
about veto ship rear --

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:33.562
once the don't are still going

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:35.897
state by state trying to procure

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:38.099
Lysons wanted time and trying

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.434
to keep up with the compliance

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:42.437
paperwork -- before we had

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.739
of Reno shipper we had licenses

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.808
in other states as well it

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:47.876
doesn't matter if you don't sell

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.377
a bottle of wine usually have to

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:51.980
file the paperwork every quarter

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:55.817
so they are kind of a god send

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:58.220
there are challenges coming for

01:20:58.286 --> 01:21:00.355
all of us there's also new move

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:01.756
with the started in New York

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:04.926
that possibly wineries websites

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:07.529
need to be AT a compliance

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:14.236
right okay --

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:15.770
I understand eighty a need

01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:17.138
they have their needs but I

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.240
don't think it's tops with

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:19.941
wineries doesn't that become

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:21.443
every website on the planet

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:24.846
so we do have our challenges

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.816
-- veto shivers definitely

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:28.984
helping with that

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:32.387
in the end for us

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:35.790
we have phone it is actually

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:39.194
easier to ship to other

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:40.629
countries than it is

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:42.264
to ship to other states

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.667
UPS is partnering with small

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.669
businesses and wineries to

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.272
help remove them in offering

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:52.674
all sorts of special services

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:54.175
to small people who want

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:56.111
to ship across the sea

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.080
and we are moving in that

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:00.181
direction because we don't

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:01.683
have to have a life state

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:03.618
we don't have to register

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.720
we have to pay taxes and --

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:08.690
-- duties but the

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:11.426
okay but you're doing that

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:13.862
per country not every time

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.297
for state four times a year

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:17.999
so the director

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:19.868
consumers will be coming

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:23.605
it never having a difficult area

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.807
for us and a challenge for us

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:28.643
to get our product to consumers

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:30.879
are the solutions beyond

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:33.081
veto shipper I think it was

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:34.949
mentioned earlier if stage could

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:36.518
just come together and talk

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:40.355
maybe that would help --

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:44.359
also want to thank the ABC

01:22:44.426 --> 01:22:45.627
for the tax break I mean come

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:47.662
on thank you for the excise

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:48.963
taxes that's a big help

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:53.068
-- the other thing

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:54.803
that is obviously affecting is

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:57.405
even across the board is this

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:59.274
whole terror finger to work

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.477
it's -- affecting us in

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.646
both directions most of

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:05.980
the small business small

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:07.882
wineries use imported

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:10.285
glass usually from China

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:13.955
as of September the chair of

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:15.957
his ten percent on imported

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:18.226
glass from China as of

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:20.995
January one is going up

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.564
to twenty five percent

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:27.135
that not only drives my

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:30.305
Costa even my glass supplier

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:31.773
is wondering if he's going

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:32.607
to be able to stay in

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.909
business with those types of

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:37.278
in of terrace imposed on

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:40.115
glass so situation three we

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:43.451
we can't get our glass for

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:45.086
what we used to and if we

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.187
want to ship to try to --

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:47.856
by the way there's a fifteen

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:50.625
percent tariff on that too so

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:52.827
I think for the small business

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:53.928
the direction things are

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:56.197
going is becoming more more

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:58.700
difficult when you're a large

01:23:58.767 --> 01:23:59.934
corporation in this industry

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.803
to look you you can source your

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.838
glass worldwide I mean you can

01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:05.106
go wherever will just go to

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:07.008
this country is that we can't

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:09.077
we can't do that the that's

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:11.813
just not feasible for us so

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.349
I know someone contemplating I'm

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:16.751
not understood of listen server

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:19.220
issues in getting our

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:21.856
product to customers and

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:23.925
the process in the

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:27.529
regulations to do that --

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:29.697
I also heard mentioned earlier

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:30.865
looking to go through through

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:32.834
the names about workman's

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.969
comp insurance which we're

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.504
fortunate to have in our water

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:38.373
but there was a whole big who

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.942
-- actually that happened in

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.544
our Valley they shot the winery

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:44.946
down they used to use volunteers

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.482
and someone got hurt

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.285
an unfortunate the owner not

01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:51.886
the best out of to the world

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:53.788
didn't cooperate and he got

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.190
shut down after about a hundred

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:56.291
and forty thousand dollars in

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:58.827
fines I think there needs

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:01.129
to be a way we can offer workers

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:03.498
comp insurance to volunteers

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:06.067
is a huge the industry's use

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:07.135
volunteers for hundreds of

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:09.003
years and all the sudden one

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:12.106
answer without one it's gone

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:14.642
instead of finding a way to make

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:16.611
it work it just has gone away

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:20.348
so anyway those are my main

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:22.183
issues -- little bit about

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.419
the winery you know we're

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.788
we were the first urban

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:29.224
winery in the Livermore valley

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:31.392
-- we're the forty third were

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:33.294
now somewhere between sixty and

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:35.797
seventy -- our fruit or close

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:36.898
truths across the street

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:37.799
from will have to go that

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.901
far for a ninety five percent

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.769
or -- Livermore alkylated

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.539
but winds and we're just mom

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.074
pop were between three five

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.243
thousand cases and trying to

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.044
get our product out there --

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:51.379
we also use readership for

01:25:51.446 --> 01:25:53.014
we do a private label for

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:55.316
-- let's just say someone in

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:57.685
show business the we use

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:59.087
in our support for her wind

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.322
as well so I think there

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:03.491
there's some hope but there's

01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:05.827
some challenges as well so

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:07.662
thank you for your time thank

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.397
you this long will be -- taking

01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:11.900
questions after the next speaker

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:13.768
speaks in that speakers Tim

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:16.237

Gloria and Waldron --

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.566
so as you know you've got the

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:19.667
vice president for California

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:21.002
state relations here for wine

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.570
institute to talk to you about

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:23.938
federal and international trade

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:26.074
so go a little little easy on me

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.509
-- today -- I think you're all

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:30.178
aware but -- one institutes

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:31.379
-- essentially association

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:33.581
California wineries -- we have

01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:35.783
-- just under a thousand --

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:37.352
winery and associated business

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:39.220
members -- throughout the state

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:42.590
and -- advocates on all levels

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:44.626
-- pretty much every issue

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:46.160
her today somebody on wine

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:47.862
institute is is actively working

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.631
on those issues for example my

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:52.300
colleague -- Steve gross --

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:54.836
has a -- phalanx of folks

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:57.171
working in every state in our

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:59.874
country -- helping to -- work

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.175
with these like direct to

01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:03.978
consumer shipping issues -- and

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:05.747
-- yeah it is sort of ironic

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.081
that you mention sometimes it's

01:28:07.148 --> 01:28:09.150
easier to ship overseas than in

01:28:09.217 --> 01:28:11.519
the state in the -- state and

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:12.920
-- it occurred to me just one

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:14.789
quick comment on that up one

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:17.558
institute -- was -- one

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:20.395
of the big -- organizations

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:21.596
that help with the formation

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:22.864
of an organization called

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:25.767
the worldwide trade group at

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:28.202
-- this organization that is

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:29.971
goals to get member countries

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:32.306
together to kind of standardized

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:33.741
-- the rules and regulations

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:35.009
related to the import and

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:37.311
export of our wine products

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:39.380
-- something that maybe we

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:41.416
could look at to do within the

01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:44.052
United States of for example so

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:46.354
-- in any case -- what I want

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:48.423
to talk to about -- today is

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:49.490
some of the issues once it's

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:51.793
active on -- in Congress and

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:54.529
also -- touch upon just a few

01:28:54.595 --> 01:28:56.030
the international trade issues

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:57.832
-- that were active on these

01:28:57.899 --> 01:28:59.734
are gonna be by no means -- all

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:01.069
of them but I I thought I just

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:02.470
point out some of the highlights

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.306
-- so first of all -- our top

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:07.775
priority right now is -- to

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:10.812
extend the provisions of the

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:12.747
-- craft beverage modernization

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:15.383
act -- this past of just

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.485
over a year ago and represented

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:19.487
the first time in eighty years

01:29:19.821 --> 01:29:22.056
-- that we've seen an excise tax

01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:24.759
reduction for our another

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:27.161
-- of color products -- the

01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:28.830
unfortunate part of getting

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:31.065
that done is we had to --

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.267
to compromise essentially and

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:35.770
take a two year -- extension

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.438
when we are pushing for --

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:40.374
permanence -- so we are

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:42.944
-- working very hard to --

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:45.480
to get in place legislation that

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:46.948
would extend that permanently

01:29:47.348 --> 01:29:48.983
-- we think that there's broad

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.618
bipartisan support for this

01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:51.886
and it's really a matter and

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:53.087
Congress of finding the right

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:54.689
vehicle an opportunity to make

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:57.058
it happen -- this is something

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.960
that -- I think you all can

01:29:59.026 --> 01:30:01.229
help with and talking to your

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:03.164
-- congressman the represent --

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:04.632
your areas and encourage them

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:06.501
to sign on -- one of things

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:07.769
that allowed us to get that

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:09.270
legislation passed in the first

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:10.838
place with a huge number of

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:12.707
co sponsors we had in both the

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:14.976
Congress and Senate -- we did

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:16.611
not have every California member

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:18.179
signed on to that and it's a

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.214
goal of ours to get their -- I

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:22.016
know some of them are like Mike

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:24.152
Thompson representing several

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.653
of you guys he's obviously

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.989
signed on to that but -- --

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:30.324
anyway it's -- whatever help

01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:31.492
you can do to push your --

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:33.227
congresspersons to support that

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:35.663
-- helps out effort --

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.498
we don't think that it's -- of

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:40.168
any consequence -- relative to

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:42.670
the -- it passed the bill

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:44.172
that the house flip to Democrats

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:45.873
-- due to the bipartisan nature

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:48.476
of this issue and in fact --

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:50.645
have the we don't know if

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:51.579
that's a plus is gonna end

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:53.714
up speaker probably but --

01:30:53.781 --> 01:30:55.449
with Kevin McCarty and and

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:56.517
that's politically in the two

01:30:56.584 --> 01:30:58.152
leaders in Congress both being

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.353
from California that can't

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:02.256
hurt our chances -- secondly

01:31:02.323 --> 01:31:04.258
-- we've been -- working really

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:06.494
hard for a while now -- on the

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:09.130
farm bills -- we think that

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:11.132
there is a -- very decent

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:13.434
chance of the farm bill -- get

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:15.269
extended another -- five years

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:16.737
during the lame duck session

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:19.640
and -- the couple programs in

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:21.843
there that are -- -- consequence

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:24.178
to the wine industry are the

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:26.013
market access program commonly

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.849
referred to as the map program

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:30.051
-- this is the program that

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:33.054
funds -- the export -- programs

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:36.324
the -- bummer with that is --

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:37.558
we've lost a lot of funding

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:39.460
from that program over time

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:41.028
-- findings remain flat from

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:42.363
Congress where more and more

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:43.397
people of that have been

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:45.700
applying for that funding -- we

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:48.135
once were receiving -- fifteen

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:49.170
million dollars a year for

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:50.872
that program for to support the

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:52.907
export of United States wine

01:31:53.374 --> 01:31:55.676
and -- we're going to consider

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:56.978
to win this year if we get

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:59.247
eight so it's it's been pretty

01:31:59.313 --> 01:32:01.015
dramatically reduced over over

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:03.150
time -- that's something that

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:04.452
we really hope to see more

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:05.853
funding into that program in

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.222
the future -- it's only

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:09.924
the entire map programs only

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:11.025
two hundred million dollars

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:12.260
which is a very small piece

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:13.594
of the overall farm bill

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:16.931
-- the other -- it in some

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:18.199
context for that by the way

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:19.667
the overall funding for that

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.135
-- market access programs two

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.837
hundred million dollars that

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:25.039
is still less than and the

01:32:25.106 --> 01:32:27.608
European Union has just for one

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:30.645
so that's the in there's

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:31.812
many other countries that

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:34.148
export one as well so it --

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:36.784
compared to other countries --

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:38.252
you know I I think our country

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:39.687
frankly could stand a step up

01:32:39.754 --> 01:32:40.888
a little bit in this in this

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:42.890
area -- the other element

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.825
that's -- importance -- for

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:46.027
us out of this farm bill is

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:48.596
specialty crop funding --

01:32:48.863 --> 01:32:50.831
this -- fortunately has received

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:52.400
a bump in funding in recent

01:32:52.466 --> 01:32:53.868
years it's likely remain flat

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:55.803
and the new farm bill that given

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.939
our games in the recent past --

01:32:58.005 --> 01:32:59.006
that's something that we're not

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:01.642
overly concerned about -- the

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:03.811
-- projects that are importance

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:05.112
to the wine industry they get

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:07.348
supported for that are -- in

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:10.217
particular -- work on -- past --

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:13.020
-- past programs and -- the

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:14.755
TV quiz Pierce's disease class

01:33:14.822 --> 01:33:16.724
wing sharpshooter program of

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.526
-- great importance to our --

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:19.994
winegrowers throughout the state

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:22.930
-- we expect to receive access

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:24.365
small increase -- for that

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:25.733
program this year -- which

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.435
would be -- pretty happy about

01:33:27.835 --> 01:33:28.970
-- looking to see a fifteen

01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:30.438
million dollars -- into that

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:32.440
program that's in addition to

01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:34.075
money that -- growers themselves

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:36.177
put in -- through an assessment

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:39.513
-- also us the specialty

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.316
crop block program is a --

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:43.918
importance to the wine industry

01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:46.153
and in particular -- our work

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.822
on the California's sustainable

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:50.458
-- wine growing -- field

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:53.227
a lot of -- work to --

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:55.396
develop that program into --

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:57.598
the ability to -- influence

01:33:57.665 --> 01:33:59.700
regulation and doing research

01:33:59.767 --> 01:34:01.602
to support -- new sustainability

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:03.137
projects is funded from there

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:05.373
and we had a -- nice string it

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:08.009
success in getting getting those

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:10.077
-- program so anyway if the

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:12.146
farm bill -- gets done and this

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:14.148
lame duck session great -- at a

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:17.018
minimum -- we -- look to get

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:19.120
that -- work done by July first

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:20.755
which is -- really kind of art

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:22.289
timeline when that funding is

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:23.791
going to become critical for us

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:26.060
-- and I'm gonna be from here

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:28.596
to -- international issues --

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:32.233
the -- now after --

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:34.402
the new agreement called the --

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:37.338
ischemic this is

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:40.741
I cannot get it U. S. Mexico

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:42.410
Canada agreement the the key

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:43.411
thing they screwed up here

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:44.912
is given it city Akron and

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.482
so anyway -- this is actually

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:50.751
-- set to be signed -- to Morrow

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:52.686
and -- when it's aye Reyes of of

01:34:52.753 --> 01:34:55.122
all places and -- this

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:57.124
is something -- we are actually

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:58.859
quite excited about -- this all

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:01.028
some of the key issues -- we

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:02.730
are having an trade -- you may

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:04.799
not be aware of this but Cañada

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:06.934
is actually the number one --

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:08.836
trade partner for U. S. wine

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:12.073
and -- one of the key features

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:14.008
-- in this agreement that is a

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:16.610
huge to us is -- we had been

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:18.479
fighting with British Columbia

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:19.947
-- for -- what we considered

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:22.750
unfair trade practices

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:24.819
in the ability of our winds

01:35:24.885 --> 01:35:26.287
to be placed on grocery store

01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:28.622
shelves in British Columbia and

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:30.424
-- as part of this agreement

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:32.159
-- they're going to be changing

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:34.361
their practices and -- our

01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:36.297
access to the Canadian market

01:35:36.363 --> 01:35:38.666
will be greatly improved --

01:35:38.966 --> 01:35:39.934
it doesn't solve all of our

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.435
problems we have similar issues

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:42.903
and Quebec and Ontario that

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:43.904
-- we're going to continue

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:45.339
to work to work on but the

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:46.774
such an excellent president

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:49.009
and -- we're we're quite

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:51.011
pleased -- that this agreement

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:52.513
occurred so was a real positive

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.881
development for us and I think

01:35:53.948 --> 01:35:55.583
worthy of our industry support

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:58.986
on a less positive note and

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:00.521
and frankly there's nothing

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.289
positive to say about it is

01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:04.158
-- the China terrorists have

01:36:04.658 --> 01:36:06.594
been devastating and they're

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:08.863
going to get worse -- before

01:36:08.929 --> 01:36:11.398
they get better -- to date

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:14.068
our -- our members that ship

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:17.371
into -- this growing market and

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:19.707
-- since for for context right

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.208
now United States is the number

01:36:21.275 --> 01:36:23.978
one -- wine consuming -- country

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.015
critics take that to

01:36:28.082 --> 01:36:29.250
within the next five to ten

01:36:29.316 --> 01:36:31.252
years so this is the market

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:34.922
some days

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:38.492
and because it's so

01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:42.363
painful -- this is

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:43.931
becoming a system

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.567
retailers are scheduled

01:36:47.801 --> 01:36:49.436
to go again soon

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:51.906
to the point where -- with

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:54.208
tax into before we even

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:56.377
had a retest so we see

01:36:56.443 --> 01:36:57.645
a hundred percent markup

01:36:58.546 --> 01:37:00.514
this this --

01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:04.818
to give you an idea what kind

01:37:04.885 --> 01:37:07.521
of disadvantaged with products

01:37:08.622 --> 01:37:11.091
so so

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:13.093
beginning in January first -- in

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.629
nineteen the correct

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:18.933
percent this will be

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:20.901
paying for every --

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:23.337
US one goes into China

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:27.808
does it have a great this is

01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:31.011
for you to

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:33.080
Australian sure

01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:39.353
the mount storage

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:41.555
rooms and please tell

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:42.923
us -- going into that

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.758
country as well --

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:47.895
I just think it's a

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:50.831
to -- for us

01:37:51.432 --> 01:37:54.301
-- again this one's side

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.403
I was sad development of

01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:59.206
construed to frankly

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:01.842
see this one right now

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:04.578
it's just so

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:11.085
I wanted to mention

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:16.624
we can sit situation

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:19.159
-- this is a important

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:21.795
thing to us and as

01:38:21.862 --> 01:38:23.664
-- the United Kingdom is the

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:25.966
number two -- export market

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:28.068
for -- American line and when

01:38:28.135 --> 01:38:29.536
I say American line ninety

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:30.437
percent of that is from

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:32.006
California so I'm just be a

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:33.173
nice when I say that's really

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.776
California -- in any case --

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:37.611
with this break that situation

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:40.247
-- the believe it or not create

01:38:40.314 --> 01:38:42.483
some opportunities for for

01:38:42.549 --> 01:38:45.252
us -- the European Union --

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:48.222
has been difficult for for us

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:50.924
to negotiate frankly -- the

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:52.726
-- they have a lot of fairly

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:55.429
protective practices -- to

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:57.064
protect their industries --

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.199
California is the number four

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:01.135
one market in the world right

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:03.837
as far as production -- France

01:39:03.904 --> 01:39:06.173
Italy and Spain are the ones

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.341
that are ahead of us so it's

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:09.877
-- no great surprise there --

01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:13.247
once the brexit deal is ratified

01:39:13.314 --> 01:39:14.848
-- what happens then is we

01:39:14.915 --> 01:39:17.084
begin negotiations -- with

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:19.620
United Kingdom directly and

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:21.322
-- it's our hope that frankly

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:22.923
we can negotiate some --

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.992
better -- trade arrangements

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:26.460
-- with United Kingdom than

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:28.329
we now experience -- through

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:30.764
the European Union so --

01:39:30.831 --> 01:39:31.598
believe it or not there's

01:39:31.665 --> 01:39:33.534
it's some positive -- aspect

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.269
to that -- for our for our

01:39:35.336 --> 01:39:37.104
product -- even though I know

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:38.605
you know think what you will

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:40.374
about it in general there is

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.608
an opportunity there for for

01:39:41.675 --> 01:39:44.111
California I believe or not --

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:46.714
and lastly I want to mention

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.515
-- eight new development

01:39:48.782 --> 01:39:51.118
-- debts -- hopefully will

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:52.853
will turn positive for us

01:39:53.287 --> 01:39:55.589
is of the United States is

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:57.658
-- entering a new -- trade

01:39:57.725 --> 01:40:00.227
negotiations with Japan --

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:02.029
this is the number for export

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:04.698
market -- for -- wine products

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:07.768
-- this is -- this

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:09.069
was one where it was a real

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:11.238
lost opportunity for us -- when

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:12.706
the trump administration chose

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.608
not to go forward with the --

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:17.878
Pacific trade -- agreement --

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:20.948
we had negotiated -- the terrace

01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:22.983
-- to go down to zero -- for

01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:24.051
our products in a number of

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:26.420
Pacific Rim countries -- when

01:40:26.487 --> 01:40:27.621
that agreement was torn up we

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.057
lost that deal essentially and

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:32.426
-- were faced with still having

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:34.161
to pay fairly steep terrace

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:36.864
in Japan while those -- Chile

01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:39.032
New Zealand Australia -- are

01:40:39.099 --> 01:40:40.200
all going to be hitting zero

01:40:40.267 --> 01:40:41.402
on that terrace market deal

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:43.370
that we were frankly -- one

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.272
of the authors of originally

01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:47.608
-- so this is an opportunity

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.243
for us -- with United States

01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:51.779
-- entering -- into these --

01:40:52.012 --> 01:40:54.181
into these negotiations and

01:40:54.248 --> 01:40:55.549
we're going to be pushing hard

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:57.451
-- for -- those terrorists to

01:40:57.518 --> 01:40:59.019
be to be eliminated completely

01:40:59.086 --> 01:41:01.221
so we can be on equal footing

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:02.723
-- with our competitors into

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:04.124
that important market for us

01:41:04.958 --> 01:41:06.860
and so that was all I had for

01:41:06.927 --> 01:41:08.328
you -- I can answer questions

01:41:08.395 --> 01:41:10.164
on this and also in the area

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.632
of my actual expertise which

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:13.734
is California policy for

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:15.936
question appears whose number

01:41:16.003 --> 01:41:18.505
three dang it

01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:22.609
-- yeah let me think of what it

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:25.078
would be -- so we have

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:27.915
Canada Japan U. K. -- you know

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:30.250
it it's -- the E. U. yeah

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:33.420
very good yes very good any

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:35.856
other questions of either

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:38.425
yes well maybe

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:39.693
you can give us some highlights

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.994
of what we have to look forward

01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:42.596
to this year and are legislative

01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:44.465
session as far as things you're

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:47.267
advocating for --

01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:50.370
well a lot of issues that that

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:52.239
we're working on our -- have

01:41:52.306 --> 01:41:53.740
been touched upon by some of

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:55.642
the folks that preceded me --

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:58.045
-- and I'll I'll mention the

01:41:58.111 --> 01:41:59.646
issue of -- waste discharge

01:41:59.713 --> 01:42:01.114
which was was brought up here

01:42:01.181 --> 01:42:02.349
-- this isn't necessarily

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:03.817
something that -- legislature's

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:05.919
going to get involved in but --

01:42:05.986 --> 01:42:07.821
wine institute in and notably

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.790
those -- San Diego county farm

01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:11.992
bureau has been a part in

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:13.494
these talks is working on a new

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.963
statewide -- waste discharge

01:42:16.029 --> 01:42:18.966
requirements -- for wine --

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:20.968
this is a tricky situation

01:42:21.034 --> 01:42:21.768
because you got to get it

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:23.570
right but -- wanted to keep

01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:25.138
beneficiaries of this we

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:27.207
believe is going to be a smaller

01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:29.109
wineries and giving them --

01:42:29.376 --> 01:42:30.777
essentially administrative

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:33.046
-- power to it to achieve

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:35.215
compliance and a formal

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:37.150
regulatory recognition of the

01:42:37.217 --> 01:42:39.019
indeed very low risk that they

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:40.420
pose to the environment so

01:42:40.487 --> 01:42:41.255
that's something we're working

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:43.056
on the on the regulatory front

01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:46.193
-- on this state -- front

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:48.529
-- we are -- dealing with

01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:50.330
a very difficult situation right

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:52.933
now -- that arose out of

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.868
a Santa Barbara that it's --

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:56.803
has the ability to impact --

01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:58.438
wineries throughout the state

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:01.508
-- one of our member wineries

01:43:01.575 --> 01:43:02.876
as a condition of getting a

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:05.412
fermentation tank -- approved

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:07.848
was required to put on their

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:10.150
fermentation tank -- emission

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:12.586
control device add to capture

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:14.988
ethanol which is a -- though

01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:16.690
very low reactive it says on

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:17.925
precursor that's why they had

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:19.293
jurisdiction in the matter

01:43:19.726 --> 01:43:22.262
of our concern -- is

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:24.765
both the -- large costs

01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:27.000
associated with a almost

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:28.635
negligible improvement in air

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:31.138
quality but -- of greatest

01:43:31.204 --> 01:43:33.006
concern to us here is that

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.108
putting any sort of duct work

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:36.810
on top of -- your from mentor

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:38.779
creates all sorts of problems

01:43:38.845 --> 01:43:41.048
for your wine maker -- the

01:43:41.114 --> 01:43:42.816
pressure in the fermentation

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:44.518
tanks can affect one quality

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:47.020
the potential for spoilage he

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:49.489
even varietal integrity -- can

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:50.924
be a risk here because these

01:43:50.991 --> 01:43:52.025
would all be tapped into the

01:43:52.092 --> 01:43:54.127
same -- control device so we

01:43:54.194 --> 01:43:57.030
have -- tremendous -- concerns

01:43:57.331 --> 01:44:00.233
about this issue -- we have

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.769
-- been in talks -- with

01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:04.371
-- some of your colleagues

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:07.040
in the legislature -- looking

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:08.408
at potential solutions here

01:44:08.475 --> 01:44:09.309
we don't know what that's

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:10.611
going to be but this is gonna

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:12.245
be a major focus of ours --

01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:13.580
in the legislature this year

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.383
great -- center McGuire

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:19.119
thank you so much interaction

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:21.021
with longest day talk with us

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:21.989
so if you don't mind doing a

01:44:22.055 --> 01:44:22.990
little bit of a deeper dive on

01:44:23.056 --> 01:44:25.225
the issue of the shipping and

01:44:25.525 --> 01:44:26.526
know that you're talking about

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:28.996
-- individual property by

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:30.063
individual property being

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:32.366
able to work with service but

01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:35.202
has there been -- discussion

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:37.504
about bringing small there's

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:38.839
together to be able to go in

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:40.774
it since is a coop to be able

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:42.776
to do one contract talks about

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:44.177
that because that that it seems

01:44:44.244 --> 01:44:45.912
to be an ongoing challenge

01:44:46.146 --> 01:44:47.981
-- for particularly in look

01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:49.916
the ball from cinema county

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:51.418
the majority of wines are ten

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:52.886
thousand cases -- lessons number

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:54.554
county right so it's small mom

01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:55.756
and pops that are struggling

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:57.624
to be able to -- figure out

01:44:57.691 --> 01:44:59.092
how to get there their product

01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:01.328
out -- through ship in there

01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:03.397
has been some discussion I was

01:45:03.463 --> 01:45:05.499
approached of actually becoming

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.768
a distributor for several

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:09.870
entities and as a distributor

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:11.338
for law center several injuries

01:45:11.405 --> 01:45:13.840
then you assume the license

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:15.509
in that state and let's just

01:45:15.575 --> 01:45:16.710
say you're doing it for general

01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:18.745
every rule there's ten licenses

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:19.913
the don't need to be at

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.182
-- but then you have to go

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:23.083
through the A. B. C. of the

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:25.118
lives of being a distributor

01:45:25.585 --> 01:45:27.387
and the complications of

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:28.722
being a wider industry to

01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:30.524
the same time I think the ABC

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:33.026
of more of that than I do --

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.528
but it would be a process of

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:36.496
someone to do it is a of is it

01:45:36.563 --> 01:45:38.498
is a part of my business I

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:39.866
mean I'm I'm I'm I'm cleaning

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:41.034
up the president didn't hang

01:45:41.101 --> 01:45:43.236
nails should I really start

01:45:43.303 --> 01:45:45.138
distributing did to save that

01:45:45.205 --> 01:45:46.807
and again I think veto shipper

01:45:46.873 --> 01:45:48.341
is a is a godsend for all

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:50.510
of us -- because it really

01:45:50.577 --> 01:45:52.179
eliminates a lot of that

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.382
thank you great I'm not

01:45:55.449 --> 01:45:56.516
seeing any more questions I

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:57.517

that I listen and -- we've had

01:47:59.773 --> 01:48:01.441
numerous -- opportunities to

01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:02.609
talk about the wanted to see

01:48:02.676 --> 01:48:04.845
for some time and we did do

01:48:04.911 --> 01:48:06.346
some bills last year -- for

01:48:06.413 --> 01:48:08.481
farmworkers small farmer farmers

01:48:08.548 --> 01:48:09.850
-- that this apprenticeship

01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:11.952
program to the CDFA they

01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:13.386
just actually hired somebody

01:48:13.453 --> 01:48:14.387
that's going to now take

01:48:14.454 --> 01:48:16.122
over that position so there

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:18.024
are some things that are out

01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:19.192
there that I hope that you'll

01:48:19.259 --> 01:48:20.327
take advantage of through the

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:21.394
California department of food

01:48:21.461 --> 01:48:23.430
nag it's a great program --

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:24.965
it's for the smaller farmers

01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:27.400
because I to a small farmer I

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:29.135
small I'm fine with my brothers

01:48:29.202 --> 01:48:30.337
eighty acres which is not

01:48:30.403 --> 01:48:32.038
much of walnuts but you still

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:33.373
have a lot of paperwork and

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.375
I have one employee and after

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:37.110
my father passed -- I was

01:48:37.177 --> 01:48:38.078
all of a sudden sitting there

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:39.212
thought the paperwork because

01:48:39.279 --> 01:48:40.881
he hoarded his paperwork and

01:48:40.947 --> 01:48:43.216
his checkbook for years but we

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:44.784
went through things and I was

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:46.920
us -- just flabbergasted about

01:48:46.987 --> 01:48:48.855
how many pieces of paper a

01:48:48.922 --> 01:48:50.457
small businesses to go through

01:48:50.857 --> 01:48:52.859
and so -- I will continue as

01:48:52.926 --> 01:48:54.160
well as my colleagues is to

01:48:54.227 --> 01:48:55.629
make sure that we can -- have

01:48:55.695 --> 01:48:57.097
our small businesses or small

01:48:57.163 --> 01:48:59.299
farmers thrive in I think we've

01:48:59.366 --> 01:49:00.867
made some headway on some of

01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:01.968
the legislation that we have

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:03.937
run we did the bill this past

01:49:04.004 --> 01:49:06.306
year with the a co location of

01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:08.808
breweries and wineries and in my

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:11.244
community it has tripled their

01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:13.947
income and -- spy the best thing

01:49:14.014 --> 01:49:15.015
that could happen to a small

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:16.449
business in a real community

01:49:16.516 --> 01:49:18.585
