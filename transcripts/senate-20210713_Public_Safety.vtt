WE- CREATE DIFFERENT

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:14.418

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:11.195
DOES NOT NECESSITATE A GROUP

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.663
TYPE REDUCTION AND THAT'S IT

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.598
ELIGIBILITY OF MINORITY CAN IN

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:15.666

ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE DONE

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:39.523
A HEINOUS CRIME THEY MAY NOT

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.892
HAVE HAD THE MENTAL CAPACITY OR

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:43.794
THE MATURITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:46.263
THEY WERE DOING SO WE'VE WE AS

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.599
A AS A STATE WE'VE LOWERED THAT

00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:50.534
BECAUSE OF NOT JUST HER BUT

TWENTY FIVE YEARS SEEM TO BE

00:42:56.941 --> 00:43:00.210
THE AGE WHERE WE WOULD SAY LOOK

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.547
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:06.083
AND SO WE'VE WE'VE ALLOW PEOPLE

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.985
WHO'VE DONE SOMETHING YOUNGER

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:09.787
TO GET OUT EARLIER FOR A

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.588

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:04.252
PART OF WHAT WE ADDRESSING OUT

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:06.288
OF THE BMP DISCUSSION COMMITTEE

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:08.590
DISCUSSION WAS THAT THE BILL

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:11.193
WOULD HAVE 50% CLASSROOMS 50%

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:14.763
ONLINE. BECAUSE OF SOME OF WHAT

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:19.901
IS BEING EXPECTED TO RAISE THE

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:20.836
GOING TO PROBABLY REQUIRE IN

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:23.672

NATURE. AND BUT NO THIS IS NOT

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.846
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.914
STILL A LOT OF ELEMENTS OF HOW

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:34.583
THESE OFFICERS ARE TRAINED FOR

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:35.817
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE TRYING TO

BE DONE ONLINE AND WE

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.157
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND SO THE

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:44.659
BILL STILL CREATES AN

01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:47.796
OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. TO OCCUR.

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:50.365

THE IN PERSON- COMPONENT THAT

IS REQUIRED CURRENTLY AND IT'S-

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:03.979
ITS ABILITY TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:04.980

THINK CLEARLY THIS IS- AS WE'VE

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:46.922
SEEN NOT ONLY IN THE INSTANCE

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:49.024

STARTING TO SEE MORE AND MORE

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:07.142
INSTANCES WHERE. THERE NEEDS TO

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:10.645
BE OF GREATER FOCUS. ON THESE

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.647
HOW THESE TECHNIQUES ARE USED

01:19:12.714 --> 01:19:14.182
DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES IN THE

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.417

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:18.386
WELL. AND SO TO HAVE THE PROPER

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:20.789
TRAINING THAT IN SOME INSTANCES

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:47.561
ADDRESS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

01:47:47.627 --> 01:47:51.698
LED. TO THE D. Y. N. IS. WELL

01:47:51.765 --> 01:47:55.035
NOT EVERY D. WHY IS SOMEONE WHO

01:47:55.101 --> 01:47:56.803
IS AN ALCOHOLIC IS VERY

01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:59.239
COMMONLY AND ALCOHOLISM AS WE

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:01.641
KNOW IS NOT SOMETHING THAT FOR

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:04.010
MANY PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:09.015
THAT IT IS NOT AN EASY. IT'S AN

01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:11.918
EASY THING TO OVERCOME AND SO

01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:14.421
WELL I DO NOT WANT. I DO NOT

01:48:14.487 --> 01:48:16.223
WANT DRUNK DRIVERS AND I DO NOT

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:17.858
WANT THE CONSEQUENCES OF DRUNK

01:48:17.924 --> 01:48:20.026
DRIVERS BUT I THINK THAT WE'VE

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:21.027
SEEN THAT THE DIVERSION

01:48:21.094 --> 01:48:23.463
PROGRAMS CAN SOMETIMES RESULT

01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:26.333
IN BETTER OUTCOMES. IN TERMS OF

01:48:26.399 --> 01:48:31.404
ACTUALLY- REDUCING THE END IN

01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:33.607
THE NUMBER OF DRUNK DRIVERS AND

01:48:33.673 --> 01:48:35.609
THE INTERESTING THING I FOUND

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:36.042
IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:38.078
INCREASING. A LOT OF OUR

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:39.679
PENALTIES TOWARDS DRUNK DRIVING

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:42.148
WHICH AGAIN IS NOT NECESSARILY

01:48:42.215 --> 01:48:44.451
A BAD THING AND YET WE'VE OVER

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:47.087
TWENTY TWO YEARS. ONLY SEEN A

01:48:47.153 --> 01:48:51.124
4% DROP. IN IN THE INCIDENCE OF

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:54.661
THE WHITES. I'VE NOT YET SEEN

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:56.296
ANY KIND OF STUDY THAT SHOWS

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:58.398
THAT THE DIVERSIONS ARE LESS

01:48:58.465 --> 01:49:00.567
EFFECTVE IN TERMS OF THE

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:02.836
REDUCTION OF THE D. WEISS. AND

01:49:02.903 --> 01:49:05.338
THERE IS IT WE OBVIOUSLY NEED

01:49:05.405 --> 01:49:07.440
MORE DATA TO FULLY UNDERSTAND

01:49:07.507 --> 01:49:08.775
IT BUT THERE'S SOME INDICATION

01:49:08.842 --> 01:49:10.944
THAT SOME OF THE DIVERSION

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:13.146
PROGRAMS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE SO

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:15.248
I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE

01:49:15.315 --> 01:49:16.650
BILL IN THE WAY THAT IT'S

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:19.286
STRUCTURED- SO WOULD NOT BE

01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:23.390
ABLE TO SUPPORT IT AS AS- AN-

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:27.861
AS WRITTEN TODAY. AT YOU ANY

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:29.496

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:39.139
CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:49:39.205 --> 01:49:40.573
RIVER DIVERSION SPECIALLY FOR

FIRST TIME OFFENDERS AND

01:49:43.143 --> 01:49:44.411

STATED- THE BENEFITS THAT HAVE

01:49:49.649 --> 01:49:51.685
BEEN SHOWN BY OFFERING SUCH

01:49:51.751 --> 01:49:54.120
DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND ARE

01:49:54.187 --> 01:49:56.323
GIVING PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY TO-

01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:58.224
CHANGE REALIZE VERSUS LOSING

01:49:58.291 --> 01:50:00.794
THEIR LICENSE OR GOING TO JAIL

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:01.861
AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:04.030
THE- FLEXIBILITY THAT HAS BEEN

01:50:04.097 --> 01:50:05.265
IN EXISTENCE FOR QUITE SOME

01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:07.434
TIME- FOR THE FOR THE

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.102
MISDEMEANOR FIRST ON FENCES SO.

01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:10.603
I TO HAVE CHALLENGES SO WE

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:11.905
OFFERED UP SOME AMENDMENTS IT'S

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:13.440
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE

01:50:13.506 --> 01:50:14.541
NOT TAKING THE MOMENTS ARE NOT

01:50:14.607 --> 01:50:17.811
CORRECT YOU ARE CORRECT. OKAY

01:50:17.877 --> 01:50:19.913

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:27.754
FIRST OF ALL- I WANT TO TAKE A

01:50:27.821 --> 01:50:28.855
THE COMMITTEE WITH OLDER SOME

01:50:28.922 --> 01:50:30.190
HARSH DISAGREEMENT THAT'S A

01:50:30.256 --> 01:50:31.958
VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. THAT

01:50:32.025 --> 01:50:33.927
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:36.396
LIVES. AND WHETHER YOU ACCEPT

01:50:36.463 --> 01:50:37.797
OR REJECT THE FACT THAT THE

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:39.799
ALLIES ARE AS DANGEROUS AS I

01:50:39.866 --> 01:50:41.968
CLAIM THEY ARE. DOESN'T CHANGE

01:50:42.035 --> 01:50:43.136
THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE

01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:45.238
LIVES LOST EVEN TODAY AS WE

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:45.805
SPEAK BECAUSE OF AN IMPAIRED

01:50:45.872 --> 01:50:50.143
DRIVER. SPEAKING OF SENATOR

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:53.013
SKINNER TO YOUR POINT. I WOULD

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:55.148
SUBMIT TO YOU THAT AWARENESS OF

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:57.350
THE PROBLEM IS THIS PART OF THE

01:50:57.417 --> 01:50:59.586
IMPORTANT REMEDY TO TAKE CARE

01:50:59.652 --> 01:51:00.186
OF THE PROBLEM AND TO ADDRESS

01:51:00.253 --> 01:51:02.589
APPROPRIATELY NO MATTER WHAT

01:51:02.655 --> 01:51:04.157
LEGISLATION WE PASSED HERE

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:06.526
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE IMPAIRED

01:51:06.593 --> 01:51:07.127
DRIVING BY THE VERY NATURE OF

01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:10.063
ALCOHOL. THE GOAL IS TO LIMIT

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:12.465
THOSE THOSE TRAGEDIES. AND I

01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:14.501
BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL CLEARLY.

01:51:14.567 --> 01:51:16.503
DO THAT AND THE REASON WHY WILL

01:51:16.569 --> 01:51:18.505
DO IT IS BECAUSE IT WILL. EIGHT

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:21.141
AWARENESS DIVERSION DIMINISHES

01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:21.674
AWARENESS OF THIS PROBLEM

01:51:21.741 --> 01:51:24.477
BECAUSE IT RACES AT- AND THAT

01:51:24.544 --> 01:51:26.212
THE AMENDMENT FIRST OF ALL THE

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:28.715
FIRST TIME CONVICTION IS JUST

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:29.315
AS DANGEROUS AS THE SECOND OR

01:51:29.382 --> 01:51:32.819
THIRD. AND I WOULD SAY THAT-

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:34.654
IT'S TRAGIC IT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:37.557
TRAGIC THE SERIOUSNESS OF DIY

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:40.293
AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE MANY OF

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.128
US HAVE FRIENDS WHO PROBABLY.

01:51:42.195 --> 01:51:44.064
BY LATE THIS LAW AND THEY'VE

01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:45.331
NEVER HAD THERE BEEN ANY KIND

01:51:45.398 --> 01:51:47.434

NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I

01:51:56.676 --> 01:51:58.645
COME FROM A PLACE OF NOT.

DESCRIBED IN BY THE AUTHOR AND

02:22:52.931 --> 02:22:55.500

HEALTH CALL. AND THE FAMILY WAS.

02:23:00.605 --> 02:23:03.141
I DIDN'T KNOW QUITE WHAT TO DO

02:23:03.207 --> 02:23:06.044
WITH THE THEIR FAMILY MEMBER

02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:07.111
WHO WAS HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH

02:23:07.178 --> 02:23:09.681
CRISIS BUT BY THE TIME THE

02:23:14.619 --> 02:23:19.257
CALM DOWN. AND- WAS NOT ARMED

02:23:19.324 --> 02:23:22.093
AS WAS DESCRIBED AND YET WAS

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:27.131
PUT IN A HOLD. THAT TEN BECAUSE

02:23:27.198 --> 02:23:29.567
THIS CONSEQUENCE WHERE I DID

02:23:29.634 --> 02:23:30.935
THIS FAMILY NO LONGER HAS THEIR

02:23:31.002 --> 02:23:32.904
LOVED ONES SO THEY DID WHAT

02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:35.039
THEY THOUGHT WAS RIGHT AND YET

02:23:35.106 --> 02:23:39.043
THEN THIS OCCURS SO. I'M SURE

02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:41.446
THE OFFICERS DID NOT INTEND TO

02:23:41.512 --> 02:23:45.316

02:23:47.952 --> 02:23:51.356
SO. WE HOPE THERE'S NOT

02:23:51.422 --> 02:23:53.358
APPROPRIATE TIME TO USE SUCH A

02:23:53.424 --> 02:23:55.259

02:23:55.994 --> 02:23:57.495

02:23:57.562 --> 02:23:59.764
APPROPRIATE TIME TO USE THAT TO

BUT SOME REPORTS THEIR

02:39:32.229 --> 02:39:33.497
EXPERIENCE WITH SEXUAL VIOLENCE

02:39:33.563 --> 02:39:35.098

TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS THAT TOO

02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:39.603
OFTEN FAIL THEM. FOR EXAMPLE

02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:41.271
PLEASE MAKE BELT UNDERGO A

02:39:41.338 --> 02:39:42.839

02:39:53.817 --> 02:39:56.186
HARMFUL QUESTIONING BASED ON

02:39:58.956 --> 02:40:00.324
INCLUDES THE IDEA THAT THE WAY

02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:01.525
SOMEONE IS DRESSED IS RELEVANT

02:40:01.591 --> 02:40:02.926
TO DETERMINING WHETHER THEY

02:40:02.993 --> 02:40:04.861
HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED. THIS IDEA

02:40:04.928 --> 02:40:06.129
THAT SOMEHOW SURVIVORS WERE

02:40:06.196 --> 02:40:08.131

SURVIVORS BLAME THEMSELVES FOR

02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:13.637

02:40:16.907 --> 02:40:18.942
WEARING TO NAME A FEW. DON'T

MISTER CHAIR I WAS JUST

02:49:26.256 --> 02:49:29.292
WONDERING IS MISS ASSEMBLY

02:49:29.359 --> 02:49:32.729
MEMBER GONZALEZ I GUESS AND- IN

02:49:32.795 --> 02:49:34.931
LIEU OF THE AUTHOR CAN SPEAK TO

02:49:34.998 --> 02:49:36.466
THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE

02:49:36.533 --> 02:49:41.304
OPPOSITION. SO I ACTUALLY THINK

02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:44.107
THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. DROVE

02:49:44.173 --> 02:49:46.843
IT HOME- IT DOES NOT MATTER IF

02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:48.278
A WOMAN IS WALKING DOWN THE

02:49:48.344 --> 02:49:50.179
STREET IN A G. STRING AND HIGH

02:49:50.246 --> 02:49:52.782
HEELS WITH A T. SHIRT THAT SAYS

02:49:52.849 --> 02:49:55.251
PLEASE RATE ME. THAT IS NOT

02:49:55.318 --> 02:49:57.554
EVIDENCE OF CONSENT. AND SO

02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:00.590
THERE IS NO SITUATION THAT I

02:50:00.657 --> 02:50:02.592
WOULD CHALLENGE ANYONE TO COME

02:50:02.659 --> 02:50:04.794
UP WITH WHERE WHAT SOMEBODY IS

02:50:04.861 --> 02:50:07.463
WEARING IS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT

02:50:07.530 --> 02:50:09.799
IT IS TIME TO TAKE THAT OUT OF.

02:50:09.866 --> 02:50:12.702
THE DISCUSSION IT IS A BARRIER

02:50:12.769 --> 02:50:14.671
TO A WOMAN IF SHE FEELS LIKE

02:50:14.737 --> 02:50:16.239
SHE'S GOING TO BE BLAMED OR

02:50:16.306 --> 02:50:17.307
THAT THAT IS GOING TO COME UP

02:50:17.373 --> 02:50:19.943
EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE JURY IS A

02:50:20.009 --> 02:50:22.845
BARRIER TO IT TO HER. OR HIM

02:50:22.912 --> 02:50:25.214
ASSERTING THE RIGHTS. AND SO I

02:50:25.281 --> 02:50:27.250
YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY I CAN'T

02:50:27.317 --> 02:50:28.351
BELIEVE IN THIS DAY AND AGE WE

02:50:28.418 --> 02:50:30.119
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION IT IS A

02:50:30.186 --> 02:50:31.754
SUGGESTS THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE

02:50:31.821 --> 02:50:33.389
SOMEBODY IT'S EVIDENCE OF BEING

02:50:33.456 --> 02:50:36.759
A SEX WORKER I. I CAN'T EVEN

02:50:36.826 --> 02:50:38.661
WRAP MY ARMS AROUND WHAT WAS

02:50:38.728 --> 02:50:41.698
JUST SAT. IN IT SHOWS EXACTLY

02:50:41.764 --> 02:50:43.733
WHY WE NEED THIS PROHIBITION.

02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:47.370
NO MAN OR WOMAN. SHOULD BE

02:50:47.437 --> 02:50:49.672
SHAMED FOR WHAT THEY WORE AND

02:50:49.739 --> 02:50:51.007
THAT SHOULD NOT BE EVER

02:50:51.074 --> 02:50:54.177
RELEVANT AS A MATTER OF CONSENT

02:50:54.243 --> 02:50:58.181
IN A SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. SO

02:50:58.247 --> 02:51:01.751
MY FELLOW QUESTION IS THIS-

02:51:01.818 --> 02:51:07.023
THIS IS ONLY PERTAIN TO- RAPE

02:51:07.090 --> 02:51:09.225
CRIMES AND CRIMES OF SEXUAL

02:51:09.292 --> 02:51:10.793
ASSAULT OR EXISTS FOR ALL

02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:13.963
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AT TWO

02:51:14.030 --> 02:51:21.771
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES SEX CRIMES.

02:51:21.838 --> 02:51:23.373
YOU IN CRIMINAL CASES INVOLVING

02:51:23.439 --> 02:51:27.677
SEXUAL ASSAULT- THE MICHIGAN

02:51:27.744 --> 02:51:33.650
WHICH OF COURSE. NOT A QUESTION

02:51:33.716 --> 02:51:35.218
PER SE BUT I YOU KNOW I HAVE

02:51:35.284 --> 02:51:37.086
BEEN STRUGGLING WITH WHETHER

02:51:37.153 --> 02:51:39.422
THIS REALLY DOES REDUCE

02:51:39.489 --> 02:51:41.524
JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND IT'S A

02:51:41.591 --> 02:51:43.159
BIT DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE

02:51:43.226 --> 02:51:45.728
OTHER BILLS WE HAVE WHERE WE

02:51:45.795 --> 02:51:48.164
LITERALLY TAKE AWAY JUDICIAL

02:51:48.231 --> 02:51:50.199
DISCRETION AND WE JUST SAY. THE

02:51:50.266 --> 02:51:53.803
JUDGE MUST IF THEY DEFINE TEXAS

02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:54.303
CRIME THE MOST SENSITIVE

02:51:54.370 --> 02:51:56.439
CERTAIN WAY. AND I THINK THIS

02:51:56.506 --> 02:51:58.241
IS A BIT DIFFERENT I DO

02:51:58.307 --> 02:52:01.644
APPRECIATE. THE OPPOSITION'S

02:52:01.711 --> 02:52:03.946
CONCERNED THAT IT'S TAKING AWAY

02:52:04.013 --> 02:52:06.983
SOME FACTORS THE JUDGE MIGHT BE

02:52:07.050 --> 02:52:08.751
ABLE TO USE HOWEVER WE KNOW

02:52:08.818 --> 02:52:10.953
JUDGES LIKE ALL OF US HAVE

02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:15.692
DIFFERENT BIASES. AND IT IS NOT

02:52:15.758 --> 02:52:20.063
UNCOMMON TO HAVE A BIAS THAT.

02:52:20.129 --> 02:52:22.799
THE PERSON IN QUESTIONS DRESS

02:52:22.865 --> 02:52:26.302
SOMEHOW PLAYED A FACTOR IN THIS

02:52:26.369 --> 02:52:29.539
CIRCUMSTANCE THE CRIME AND SO.

02:52:29.605 --> 02:52:31.107
AND I APPRECIATE THE

02:52:31.174 --> 02:52:33.142
EXPLANATION BY THE PRESENTER

02:52:33.209 --> 02:52:35.144
THAT YOU KNOW THAT REALLY

02:52:35.211 --> 02:52:37.246
CANNOT MATTER AND I GUESS.

02:52:37.313 --> 02:52:38.781
WHILE I APPRECIATE THE

02:52:38.848 --> 02:52:40.016
CIRCUMSTANCE THE PUBLIC

02:52:40.083 --> 02:52:41.918
DEFENDER FACED WHEN DESCRIBING

02:52:41.984 --> 02:52:44.087
THAT CLIENT I THINK THE MORE

02:52:44.153 --> 02:52:46.622
RELEVANT WAS TO BE ABLE TO

02:52:46.689 --> 02:52:50.259
PROVE THAT THAT CLIENT. I WAS

02:52:50.326 --> 02:52:55.131
ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN A. FIVE IN

02:52:55.198 --> 02:52:57.867
A TRANSACTION WHERE THEN THE

02:52:57.934 --> 02:53:02.638
CHANGE B. B. R. DEMAND WAS

02:53:02.705 --> 02:53:04.607
CHANGED AS TO THE PAYMENT ON

02:53:04.674 --> 02:53:07.944
THE TRANSACTION- AND SO NOT

02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:09.345
KNOWING ENOUGH ABOUT THAT CASE

02:53:09.412 --> 02:53:11.981
I CAN'T IN ANY WAY SPEAK TO WHY

02:53:12.048 --> 02:53:15.718
OR WHY NOT IT WAS UNABLE TO BE

02:53:15.785 --> 02:53:18.187
DEFENDED AS A NON RATE. HOWEVER

02:53:18.254 --> 02:53:21.991
I THINK THAT AGAIN D. D. YOU

02:53:22.058 --> 02:53:23.493
KNOW THERE CAN BE SEX WORKERS

02:53:23.559 --> 02:53:25.661
WHO ARE NOT DRESSED IN A

02:53:25.728 --> 02:53:28.131
PROVOCATIVE MANNER SO IT

02:53:28.197 --> 02:53:31.601
SEEMED- AGAIN I CAN'T YOU KNOW

02:53:31.667 --> 02:53:35.738
USING EXAMPLE PROBABLY. IT WAS

02:53:35.805 --> 02:53:37.974
IT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADD

02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:39.575
CLARITY TO US IN TRYING TO

02:53:39.642 --> 02:53:42.411
FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE IT VERY

02:53:42.478 --> 02:53:43.746
WELL COULD BE THE CASE THAT

02:53:43.813 --> 02:53:47.683
THAT PARTICULAR SEX WORKER- WAS

02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:49.986
NOT RAPED AND SO THE PERSON

02:53:50.052 --> 02:53:50.820
THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER WAS

02:53:50.887 --> 02:53:53.289
DEFENDING YOU KNOW MAY NOT HAVE

02:53:53.356 --> 02:53:56.692
BEEN. GUILTY OF RAPE EVER THAT

02:53:56.759 --> 02:53:59.128
PARTICULAR YEAH I DESCRIPTION

02:53:59.195 --> 02:54:01.564
OF JUST THE CLONING SHOULD NOT

02:54:01.631 --> 02:54:03.933
REALLY BE A FACTOR SO. I THINK

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:05.168
ABOUT THE WAYS THAT WE ARE

02:54:05.234 --> 02:54:06.536
TRYING TO CORRECT FOR THE

02:54:06.602 --> 02:54:08.471
VARIOUS BIASES THAT WE KNOW

02:54:08.538 --> 02:54:11.407
EXIST RACIAL BIAS SEES THESE

02:54:11.474 --> 02:54:15.912
GENDER BIAS SEES. AND SO. IT

02:54:15.978 --> 02:54:20.950
DID. YOU KNOW THIS ONE IS- IT

02:54:21.017 --> 02:54:22.752
COULD BE A GRAY AREA THOUGH I

02:54:22.819 --> 02:54:26.189
WOULD TRY HERE ON SAYING IT

02:54:26.255 --> 02:54:28.157
SHOULDN'T BE A FACTOR SO I'LL I

02:54:28.224 --> 02:54:30.193
THINK I MEAN I'M GOING TO BE

02:54:30.259 --> 02:54:33.029
SUPPORTING THE BILL. THERE COME

02:54:33.095 --> 02:54:37.333
UNDER. HE I APPRECIATE NINE

02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:40.069
SENATOR SKINNER'S- COMMENTS YOU

02:54:40.136 --> 02:54:42.171
KNOW I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN

02:54:42.238 --> 02:54:44.507
THINKING ABOUT. CASES THAT ARE

02:54:44.574 --> 02:54:46.008
NOT SO CUT AND DRY WHERE

02:54:46.075 --> 02:54:47.877
SOMEONE WAS WALKING DOWN THE

02:54:47.944 --> 02:54:50.046
STREET AND THEN YOU KNOW. THE

02:54:50.112 --> 02:54:52.381
DEFENDANT YOU KNOW. KNOCK

02:54:52.448 --> 02:54:53.683
SOMEBODY IN THE HEAD AND

02:54:53.749 --> 02:54:55.017
SEXUALLY ASSAULTS THEM VERY

02:54:55.084 --> 02:54:59.388
RARELY ARE THE CASES THAT- THE

02:54:59.455 --> 02:55:01.824
SIMPLE. I'M WONDERING ABOUT

02:55:01.891 --> 02:55:11.567
CASES WHERE- THE- VICTIM WORD

02:55:11.634 --> 02:55:14.170
IS ALSO PART OF IT WERE ENGAGED

02:55:14.237 --> 02:55:16.839
IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND WHERE

02:55:16.906 --> 02:55:19.108
THE MANNER OF THEIR DRESS OR

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:23.479
WHAT THEY ARE WEARING- IT PLAYS

02:55:23.546 --> 02:55:25.948
A ROLE IN EITHER. WEAPONS THAT

02:55:26.015 --> 02:55:27.250
THEY MAY HAVE OR THAT ARE BEING

02:55:27.316 --> 02:55:28.517
CONDEMNING THERE LIKE ALL OF

02:55:28.584 --> 02:55:29.986
THESE OTHER THINGS AND I'M JUST

02:55:30.052 --> 02:55:31.153
THINKING BACK TO THE NUMBER OF

02:55:31.220 --> 02:55:32.889
CASES AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT I

02:55:32.955 --> 02:55:34.557
HAVE HEARD ABOUT AND OFTEN

02:55:34.624 --> 02:55:36.359
TIMES AND I THINK THAT THE

02:55:36.425 --> 02:55:37.994
PUBLIC DEFENDERS DO A

02:55:38.060 --> 02:55:39.061
DISSERVICE WHEN THEY COME

02:55:39.128 --> 02:55:41.530
BECAUSE THEY KIND OF SHARE VERY

02:55:41.597 --> 02:55:44.867
ON SIMPLE EXAMPLES- BUT OFTEN

02:55:44.934 --> 02:55:49.906
TIMES. THE NOT HOW PROVOCATIVE

02:55:49.972 --> 02:55:51.540
SOMEONE IS DRESSED BUT HOW THEY

02:55:51.607 --> 02:55:53.075
pARE DRESSED BUT MAYBE WHAT THEY

02:55:53.142 --> 02:55:56.112
ARE WEARING MAY PLAY A ROLE IN

02:55:56.178 --> 02:55:56.712
SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE

02:55:56.779 --> 02:55:59.515
CONCEALING MAYBE SOMETHING THAT

02:55:59.582 --> 02:56:00.583
SOME WEAPON THAT THEY'RE GOING

02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:02.985
TO USE AND THAT DOES BECOME

02:56:03.052 --> 02:56:04.921
PART OF EVIDENCE AND THAT DOES

02:56:04.987 --> 02:56:07.056
BECOME PART OF- WHAT IS

02:56:07.123 --> 02:56:09.158
REVEALED. AND SHARED EITHER YOU

02:56:09.225 --> 02:56:11.494
KNOW DURING TRIAL OR OR WITH

02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:13.829
CHARGES AND SO MY CONCERN IS

02:56:13.896 --> 02:56:17.366
THAT NGUYEN SOMETHING WHEN

02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:20.102
CLOTHING IS RELEVANT. TO THE

02:56:20.169 --> 02:56:22.705
CASE IN THAT WAY DOES THIS MAKE

02:56:22.772 --> 02:56:24.974
THAT INADMISSIBLE SO IT'S NOT

02:56:25.041 --> 02:56:26.342
SO MUCH THAT SOMEONE WAS

02:56:26.409 --> 02:56:28.477
PROVOCATIVELY DRESSED BUT YOU

02:56:28.544 --> 02:56:31.013
KNOW THE- YOU KNOW THE RAZOR

02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:33.516
BLADE OR WHATEVER. WHAT IS THE

02:56:33.582 --> 02:56:37.520
AND- YOU KNOW- SO THAT'S MY CAN

02:56:37.586 --> 02:56:39.021
AND I WANT TO AND I'M DON'T

02:56:39.088 --> 02:56:41.157
KNOW IF THIS ADDRESSES THOSE

02:56:41.223 --> 02:56:43.626
KINDS OF SCENARIOS. SO THAT WAS

02:56:43.693 --> 02:56:44.727
WHY I ACTUALLY ASKED M

02:56:44.794 --> 02:56:46.762
ORIGINAL QUESTION BECAUSE I'M

02:56:46.829 --> 02:56:48.564
TRYING TO GET AT IF THIS

02:56:48.631 --> 02:56:51.300
PREVENT CERTAIN EVIDENCE- FROM

02:56:51.367 --> 02:56:54.670
BEING ADMISSIBLE. SENATOR IF I

02:56:54.737 --> 02:56:59.108
MAY. THROUGH THE CHAIR AT. MY

02:56:59.175 --> 02:57:01.210
UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL IS

02:57:01.277 --> 02:57:02.378
THAT IT CANNOT BE USED FOR

02:57:02.445 --> 02:57:04.413
EVIDENCE OF CONSENT IN A SEXUAL

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:05.848
ASSAULT NOT THAT IT CAN'T BE

02:57:05.915 --> 02:57:08.517
USED- FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE

02:57:08.584 --> 02:57:10.353
WHEN THAT TYPE OF THE TYPE OF

02:57:10.419 --> 02:57:11.654
SCENARIO YOU'RE GOING THRILLED

02:57:11.721 --> 02:57:13.322
WOULD. PROBABLY INVOLVE MORE

02:57:13.389 --> 02:57:14.824
THAN A RAPE HARGE IN OUR

02:57:14.890 --> 02:57:15.658
ASSAULT CHARGE RIGHT THERE'S

02:57:15.725 --> 02:57:17.159
OTHER THINGS GOING ON SO THIS

02:57:17.226 --> 02:57:19.528
PARTICULAR- PROHIBITION WOULD

02:57:19.595 --> 02:57:21.464
BE UTILIZING WHAT THE VICTIM

02:57:21.530 --> 02:57:23.866
WAS WEARING FOR EVIDENCE OF

02:57:23.933 --> 02:57:27.870
CONSENT. AND AGAIN I CHALLENGE

02:57:27.937 --> 02:57:30.272
ANYONE BECAUSE- LITERALLY YOU

SIXTY ONE. WORDS FREE TRADE

03:54:13.539 --> 03:54:14.974
THAT'S GREAT THIS IS A

03:54:15.040 --> 03:54:17.109
PRACTICAL AND NECESSARY CHANGE

03:54:17.176 --> 03:54:18.477
IN THE LAW TO ADDRESS AN

03:54:18.544 --> 03:54:19.979
ARCHAIC PROVISION OF THE

03:54:20.045 --> 03:54:21.747
CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE. THAT

03:54:21.814 --> 03:54:23.749
DOES NOT PROTECT ALL SURVIVORS

03:54:23.816 --> 03:54:25.217
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND THAT

03:54:25.284 --> 03:54:27.219
TREATS WOMEN AS THE PROPERTY OF

03:54:27.286 --> 03:54:28.721
THEIR SPOUSES. THERE IS

03:54:28.788 --> 03:54:30.389
PRECEDENT FOR MANY OTHER STATES

03:54:30.456 --> 03:54:32.224

03:54:32.291 --> 03:54:34.326
THIS PROPOSED CHANGE IN LAW IT

03:54:34.393 --> 03:54:35.995
WOULD SIMPLIFY THE PENAL CODE.

03:54:36.061 --> 03:54:37.963
IT WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE

03:54:38.030 --> 03:54:39.098
THE BURDEN OF PROOF THAT

03:54:39.165 --> 03:54:40.699
PROSECUTORS LIKE MYSELF WOULD

03:54:40.766 --> 03:54:45.237
HAVE TO MEET IN A COURT OF LAW

03:54:45.304 --> 03:54:45.771
BEFORE SECURING A CRIMINAL

03:54:45.838 --> 03:54:49.141
CONVICTION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE-

03:54:49.208 --> 03:54:50.376

03:54:50.443 --> 03:54:52.211

03:54:55.581 --> 03:54:56.916
FAILS TO MAKE THIS DISTINCTION

03:54:56.982 --> 03:54:58.284
OR THAT THAT CONTINUES TO MAKE

03:54:58.350 --> 03:54:59.752
THIS DISTINCTION I SHOULD SAY

03:54:59.819 --> 03:55:01.620
BETWEEN SPOUSAL RAPE AND NON

03:55:01.687 --> 03:55:04.290

04:10:34.753 --> 04:10:35.887
OF CONSENTING TO SET. ALTHOUGH

04:10:35.954 --> 04:10:38.022
CPD UNDER THE DESIGN. TO

04:10:38.089 --> 04:10:39.958
RECOGNIZE THE TRAUMA DISPOSAL

04:10:40.024 --> 04:10:42.694
RATE AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE IS

04:10:42.761 --> 04:10:44.662
BAD PUBLIC POLICY IN THAT IT

04:10:44.729 --> 04:10:47.265
TAKES AWAY JUDICIAL DISCRETION

04:10:47.332 --> 04:10:49.701

04:10:49.768 --> 04:10:52.604
CENTERED. ON INDIVIDUALS BY

TAKING AWAY JUDICIAL DISCRETION

04:10:54.773 --> 04:10:57.275
AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE FORCES

04:10:57.342 --> 04:10:59.010
COURTS DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE

04:10:59.077 --> 04:11:01.780
STATE PRISON EVEN IF THE VICTIM

04:11:01.846 --> 04:11:03.982

04:11:08.086 --> 04:11:12.090
AWAY AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO

04:11:12.157 --> 04:11:12.824
FIND OR KEEP EMPLOYMENT. THAT

04:11:12.891 --> 04:11:15.560
VICTIM AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

04:11:15.627 --> 04:11:17.996
THAT WOULD PLACE. ON THE VICTIM

04:11:18.062 --> 04:11:20.598
AND THE CHILDREN. BUDGET

04:11:20.665 --> 04:11:22.066

04:11:22.133 --> 04:11:23.701
IMPOSE PRISON AND OR

04:11:23.768 --> 04:11:25.770
REGISTRATION ON A DEFENDANT

04:11:25.837 --> 04:11:28.106
CONVICTED OF BELGRADE IF THAT

04:11:28.173 --> 04:11:29.874
IS THE APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT

04:11:29.941 --> 04:11:32.110
AND TAKING VICTIMS NEEDS INTO

04:11:32.177 --> 04:11:34.446
CONSIDERATION FURTHER THERE'S

04:11:34.512 --> 04:11:36.147
ALREADY A TENSION IN CALIFORNIA

04:11:36.214 --> 04:11:38.349
A LOT BETWEEN THE DESIRE TO

YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANNA- I

04:13:03.201 --> 04:13:05.270
THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- BEING

04:13:05.336 --> 04:13:09.407
THIS BILL FORWARD I- ACTUALLY

04:13:09.474 --> 04:13:12.377
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

04:13:12.443 --> 04:13:16.948
TALK ABOUT SEX- FROM A POLICY

04:13:17.015 --> 04:13:19.117
STANDPOINT. I PERSONALLY

04:13:19.183 --> 04:13:23.454
BELIEVE THAT AS A CULTURE WE-

04:13:23.521 --> 04:13:24.689
EXHIBIT INCREDIBLE

04:13:24.756 --> 04:13:27.392
SCHIZOPHRENIA- WHAT WE DO

04:13:27.458 --> 04:13:28.560
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IS

04:13:28.626 --> 04:13:29.694
INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT

04:13:29.761 --> 04:13:33.164
WE ESPOUSE IN PUBLIC- AND WE

04:13:33.231 --> 04:13:38.036
ARE- INCREDIBLY PROVINCIAL- AS

04:13:38.102 --> 04:13:42.407
A- COUNTRY. WHEN IT COMES TO

04:13:42.473 --> 04:13:45.109
SEX BUT IF YOU ASK PEOPLE THE

04:13:45.176 --> 04:13:48.780
REAL DEAL- YOU HEAR STORIES

04:13:48.846 --> 04:13:51.349
AND- ABOUT THE BEHAVIORS AND

04:13:51.416 --> 04:13:53.851
PREFERENCES THAT ARE- VERY FAR

04:13:53.918 --> 04:13:56.054
FROM THAT. AND I THINK IF WE

04:13:56.120 --> 04:13:56.554
CAN HAVE MORE AND MORE

04:13:56.621 --> 04:14:01.426
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SEX- WE CAN

04:14:01.492 --> 04:14:06.397
ERASE THE- STIGMAS THEN WE HAVE

04:14:06.464 --> 04:14:09.434
PLACED ON IT. AND HOPEFULLY

04:14:09.500 --> 04:14:10.935
ENTER INTO A DISCUSSION THAT IS

04:14:11.002 --> 04:14:15.306
FAR MORE HONEST- THEN WHAT WE

04:14:15.373 --> 04:14:18.643
TRY TO PORTRAY- I THINK AS A

04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:21.946
RESULT OF THAT. SCHIZOPHRENIA

04:14:22.013 --> 04:14:24.582
WE HAVE CREATED A VERY BROKEN

04:14:24.649 --> 04:14:27.151
SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO OUR SEX

04:14:27.218 --> 04:14:30.088
OFFENDER REGISTRY AND HOW THAT

04:14:30.154 --> 04:14:32.824
AND HOW SEX IS WEAPONIZED BY

04:14:32.890 --> 04:14:35.560
OUR D. A.'S. TOM OFTENTIMES

04:14:35.627 --> 04:14:37.128
AGAINST BLACK AND BROWN

04:14:37.195 --> 04:14:38.863
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE ALL YOU

04:14:38.930 --> 04:14:42.200
HAVE TO DO IS SAY SEX IS TALK

04:14:42.266 --> 04:14:43.901
ABOUT SEX AND PEOPLE GET

04:14:43.968 --> 04:14:45.937
NERVOUS AND IT IS UNFAIR.

04:14:46.004 --> 04:14:47.472
BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT S

04:14:47.538 --> 04:14:51.843
REALLY REALLY HARD TO OVERCOME.

04:14:51.909 --> 04:14:53.778
AND I SAY THAT ALSO AS A

04:14:53.845 --> 04:14:58.549
SURVIVOR- I HAVE A COUPLE OF

04:14:58.616 --> 04:15:03.087
QUESTIONS. NUMBER ONE IS DOES

04:15:03.154 --> 04:15:06.958
THIS BILL SPEAK TO- YOU KNOW

04:15:07.025 --> 04:15:10.728
CONSENTING ACTS. OF ROLE PLAY

04:15:10.795 --> 04:15:13.631
AND ROUGH PLAY THAT OFTEN TIMES

04:15:13.698 --> 04:15:16.734
CAN HAPPEN- BETWEEN CONSULTING

04:15:16.801 --> 04:15:19.037
CONSENTING- AND PROBABLY

04:15:19.103 --> 04:15:21.105
CONSULTING ADULTS WHO ARE

04:15:21.172 --> 04:15:24.942
MARRIED- BECAUSE I WOULD BE

04:15:25.009 --> 04:15:30.448
CONCERNED ABOUT- EIGHT YOU KNOW

04:15:30.515 --> 04:15:32.116
IF THIS IS SILENT ON THAT AND

04:15:32.183 --> 04:15:34.252
THEN HOW THAT IS EITHER USED OR

04:15:34.318 --> 04:15:37.221
MISCONSTRUED OR MISUSED OR-

04:15:37.288 --> 04:15:38.222
BECAUSE I THINK CRIMINAL

04:15:38.289 --> 04:15:39.490
CHARGES OF ANY NATURE REALLY

04:15:39.557 --> 04:15:43.795
IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE- YOU

04:15:43.861 --> 04:15:44.762
KNOW THOUGHT ABOUT VERY

04:15:44.829 --> 04:15:46.698
CAREFULLY. BEFORE LEVIED

04:15:46.764 --> 04:15:48.099
AGAINST SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW

04:15:48.166 --> 04:15:51.969
BECAUSE- TO SOME OF THE

04:15:52.036 --> 04:15:53.037
CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY

04:15:53.104 --> 04:15:57.608
THE OPPOSITION- THOSE COULD

04:15:57.675 --> 04:16:00.978
COME INTO INTO PLAY- IF

04:16:01.045 --> 04:16:03.681
ALLEGATIONS OF- OF SPOUSAL

04:16:03.748 --> 04:16:09.587
RAPE- WERE LEVIED- PHIL LET ME

04:16:09.654 --> 04:16:14.692
START OFF BY- IF THE SPELL THE

04:16:14.759 --> 04:16:16.094
ROLE PLAY IS CONSENSUAL WHETHER

04:16:16.160 --> 04:16:18.663
YOU'RE MARRIED OR NOT. I WOULD

04:16:18.730 --> 04:16:24.302
SAY THAT. THAT'S NOT RAPE AND-

04:16:24.368 --> 04:16:25.603
WE HAVE A VERY DETAILED IN THE

04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:27.171
LAST QUESTION THAT I DON'T WANT

04:16:27.238 --> 04:16:29.907
TO SAY YES FOR SURE THIS ISWHAT THE BILL SAYS OR THE LAW

04:16:29.974 --> 04:16:31.175
THE PENAL CODE SECTION OF SPACE

04:16:31.242 --> 04:16:32.643
SO I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK OUT OF

04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:33.845
PLACE IT WOULD BE MY ASSUMPTION

04:16:33.911 --> 04:16:35.513
BUT I'VE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH

04:16:35.580 --> 04:16:37.148
THAT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

04:16:37.215 --> 04:16:38.282
AND SO I DON'T KNOW OF ONE OF

04:16:38.349 --> 04:16:39.217
THE WITNESSES THAT I HAD THE

04:16:39.283 --> 04:16:41.085
DAC ABLE TO ANSWER THAT

04:16:41.152 --> 04:16:41.686
QUESTION FOR YOU IN A BETTER

04:16:41.753 --> 04:16:43.387
WAY AND IF THAT WOULD BE A

04:16:43.454 --> 04:16:45.289
LITTLE BY THE CHAIR YOURSELF

04:16:45.356 --> 04:16:48.726
FOR FINANCER. I DON'T SPEAK OUT

04:16:48.793 --> 04:16:51.963
OF PLACE- ARM. AGAIN OPEN TO.

04:16:52.029 --> 04:16:53.164
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN

04:16:53.231 --> 04:16:54.899
ASK MY SECOND QUESTION. OKAY

04:16:54.966 --> 04:16:56.834
AND THEN MAYBE. THE WITNESSES

04:16:56.901 --> 04:16:59.837
CAN- RESPOND TO BOTH OF THEM.

04:16:59.904 --> 04:17:03.040
SO I. AM VERY INTERESTED IN WHY

04:17:03.107 --> 04:17:04.842
DISABILITY RIGHTS HAS A NEUTRAL

04:17:04.909 --> 04:17:06.377
POSITION ON THIS. I WILL ALSO

04:17:06.444 --> 04:17:12.116
SHARE THAT- I AM THE- CO PARENT

04:17:12.183 --> 04:17:13.985
OF A CHILD WITH DISABILITIES

04:17:14.051 --> 04:17:15.386
AND I AM INTIMATELY INVOLVED

04:17:15.453 --> 04:17:17.555
WITH THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY-

04:17:17.622 --> 04:17:18.890
AND WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH A

04:17:18.956 --> 04:17:19.991
COUPLE OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS

04:17:20.057 --> 04:17:22.560
THAT ARE IN MY DISTRICT. AND I

04:17:22.627 --> 04:17:24.595
TALK WITH THEM ABOUT THIS BILL.

04:17:24.662 --> 04:17:30.067
AND- HAPPY TO REPORT THAT- OUR

04:17:30.134 --> 04:17:31.836
DISABILITY COMMUNITY IS

04:17:31.903 --> 04:17:35.373
SEXUALLY ACTIVE AND THRIVING-

04:17:35.439 --> 04:17:36.641
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT OUR

04:17:36.707 --> 04:17:38.509
DOMINANT CULTURE HAS A VERY

04:17:38.576 --> 04:17:40.845
CONDESCENDING AND PATRONIZING-

04:17:40.912 --> 04:17:43.247
ATTITUDE TOWARDS OUR DISABILITY

04:17:43.314 --> 04:17:45.950
COMMUNITY- ONE THAT IS

04:17:46.017 --> 04:17:47.885
INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON.

04:17:47.952 --> 04:17:49.420
PROGRAMS DESIGNED AROUND SELF

04:17:49.487 --> 04:17:50.922
DETERMINATION SO THAT THEY ARE

04:17:50.988 --> 04:17:52.723
ABLE TO FULLY EXPRESS WHO THEY

04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:55.860
ARE. AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THIS

04:17:55.927 --> 04:17:57.328
BILL SPELLS OUT WHAT LEGAL

04:17:57.395 --> 04:17:59.030
CONSENT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE

04:17:59.096 --> 04:18:00.798
DISABILITY COMMUNITY. AND THE

04:18:00.865 --> 04:18:03.134
REASON WHY I ASK IS BECAUSE IN

04:18:03.201 --> 04:18:05.369
MY INTERACTIONS WITH MY FAMILY

04:18:05.436 --> 04:18:07.672
MEMBERS AND OTHER FOLKS- WHO

04:18:07.738 --> 04:18:10.842
ARE DISABLED- YOU KNOW FOLKS

04:18:10.908 --> 04:18:13.110
HAVE TICKS. FOLKS MAKE

04:18:13.177 --> 04:18:15.146
DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOUNDS FOLKS

04:18:15.213 --> 04:18:16.647
HAVE THE REGULATED AND

04:18:16.714 --> 04:18:18.950
UNREGULATED BODIES. WINDOWS

04:18:19.016 --> 04:18:21.452
DON'T ALWAYS ALIGN WITH WHAT

04:18:21.519 --> 04:18:24.255
THE DOMINANT CULTURE CONSTRUES

04:18:24.322 --> 04:18:27.391
AS BEING NORMAL. AND SO IN THE

04:18:27.458 --> 04:18:29.093
HEIGHT OF A DISCUSSION AROUND

04:18:29.160 --> 04:18:29.894
FREE BRITNEY AND

04:18:29.961 --> 04:18:31.996
CONSERVATORSHIP AND SOMEONE

04:18:32.063 --> 04:18:35.499
ELSE'S IDEA OF WHAT NORMAL IS

04:18:35.566 --> 04:18:37.602
FOR A PARTICULAR PERSON. OR

04:18:37.668 --> 04:18:40.104
WHAT SORT OF. MENTAL ACUITY

04:18:40.171 --> 04:18:42.206
INSTABILITY LOOKS LIKE IT IS

04:18:42.273 --> 04:18:44.041
VERY DIFFERENT FOR FOLKS YOU

04:18:44.108 --> 04:18:44.876
KNOW IN THE DISABILITY

04:18:44.942 --> 04:18:46.210
COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY FOLKS

04:18:46.277 --> 04:18:48.946
WITH DOWN SYNDROME- AND SO I'M

04:18:49.013 --> 04:18:51.082
VERY CURIOUS ABOUT DOES THIS

04:18:51.148 --> 04:18:52.316
SPELL OUT WHAT LEGAL CONSENT

04:18:52.383 --> 04:18:53.985
LOOKS LIKE FOR THEM BECAUSE

04:18:54.051 --> 04:18:56.787
WHAT I SEE AND WHAT I HEAR.

04:18:56.854 --> 04:18:59.056
RIGHT WITH TWO CONSENTING WHO

04:18:59.123 --> 04:19:01.192
ARE ALSO WHO IN AND THE MANY

04:19:01.259 --> 04:19:02.627
INSTANCES SOMEONE WHO HAS DOWN

04:19:02.693 --> 04:19:03.594
SYNDROME IS MARRIED TO SOMEONE

04:19:03.661 --> 04:19:04.762
WHO HAS DOWN SYNDROME NOT

04:19:04.829 --> 04:19:05.963
ALWAYS THESE ARE SOME

04:19:06.030 --> 04:19:10.201
GENERALIZATIONS BUT- I'M JUST

04:19:10.268 --> 04:19:11.602
CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I

04:19:11.669 --> 04:19:12.904
MAY SEE SOMETHING OR HEAR

04:19:12.970 --> 04:19:13.838
SOMETHING AND SAY OH MY

04:19:13.905 --> 04:19:16.140
GOODNESS. THIS PERSON IS BEING

04:19:16.207 --> 04:19:19.076
RAPED. BUT THAT MAY NOT BE THE

04:19:19.143 --> 04:19:20.645
CASE IT'S JUST A SOUND THAT

04:19:20.711 --> 04:19:23.180
MAYBE I DON'T ASSOCIATE WITH

04:19:23.247 --> 04:19:25.349
YOU KNOW WHAT I EXPERIENCE WHEN

04:19:25.416 --> 04:19:28.886
I'M HAVING SEX. SO I'M CURIOUS

04:19:28.953 --> 04:19:30.588
WHAT HOW THE WHAT THIS IS THE

04:19:30.655 --> 04:19:32.823
SILENT ON THAT OR ARE THERE

04:19:32.890 --> 04:19:34.325
SOME SPECIFICS ON THAT BECAUSE

04:19:34.392 --> 04:19:35.927
I WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

04:19:35.993 --> 04:19:37.595
US CRIMINALISING SEXUAL

04:19:37.662 --> 04:19:40.765
INTERCOURSE AND BEHAVIOR-

04:19:40.831 --> 04:19:41.799
BETWEEN FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE

04:19:41.866 --> 04:19:43.868
DISABILITY COMMUNITY. THANK YOU

04:19:43.935 --> 04:19:46.737
FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK. WE I

04:19:46.804 --> 04:19:47.872
PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO

04:19:47.939 --> 04:19:49.740
CREATE THE SPACE AND BE BETTER

04:19:49.807 --> 04:19:51.242
TOWARD DISABLED COMMUNITY X. X.

04:19:51.309 --> 04:19:53.044
I THINK WE IMPOSE NORMS ON FAIR

04:19:53.110 --> 04:19:54.812
THERE. AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE

04:19:54.879 --> 04:19:56.380
TO HAVE THE WILL AND ABILITY

04:19:56.447 --> 04:19:58.015
THE FREE WILL TO SAY YES AND

04:19:58.082 --> 04:20:00.384
ALSO TO STAY NOW- AND I AGREE

04:20:00.451 --> 04:20:02.119
WITH YOU THAT OFTEN TEND TO

04:20:02.186 --> 04:20:04.388
MISCONSTRUE THAT AND WE- WE ARE

04:20:04.455 --> 04:20:06.223
NOT ALWAYS FOR IN THAT SPACE.

04:20:06.290 --> 04:20:07.758
IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

04:20:07.825 --> 04:20:10.828
DISABILITY RIGHTS COALITION- WE

04:20:10.895 --> 04:20:12.063
STARTED TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION

04:20:12.129 --> 04:20:13.297
OF A HIGHLY MAKE SURE THEY'RE

04:20:13.364 --> 04:20:15.066
ABLE TO SAY YES AND ABLE TO SAY

04:20:15.132 --> 04:20:16.634
NO. AND I WOULD SAY THAT AT

04:20:16.701 --> 04:20:18.202
THIS POINT THE BILL ISN'T CLEAR

04:20:18.269 --> 04:20:19.570
ON THAT SPACE AND AMENDMENT

04:20:19.637 --> 04:20:21.238
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY A

04:20:21.305 --> 04:20:24.208
COMMITTEE. AND IT IT DOES IT IT

04:20:24.275 --> 04:20:25.843
ALLOWS FOR YES BUT IT DOESN'T

04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:28.546
ALLOW FOR NOW. OUT THERE I

04:20:28.612 --> 04:20:29.180
WOULD SAY NO MATTER WHAT

04:20:29.246 --> 04:20:30.648
HAPPENS WE NEED TO GET THIS

04:20:30.715 --> 04:20:32.450
RIGHT WHETHER IT'S- BEFORE THIS

04:20:32.516 --> 04:20:36.253
MOVES- TO OUT OF DISPENSED OR A

04:20:36.320 --> 04:20:37.421
NEW BILL MAKE SURE THAT'S IN

04:20:37.488 --> 04:20:38.222
THE COMMITMENT WITH THE

04:20:38.289 --> 04:20:39.457
DISABILITIES RIGHTS GROUPS.

04:20:39.523 --> 04:20:41.325
THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT

04:20:41.392 --> 04:20:44.328
I. BECAUSE THE AMENDMENT

04:20:44.395 --> 04:20:45.730
OFFERED ONLY ALLOWS FOR YES AN

04:20:45.796 --> 04:20:47.198
OFFER NO IT MAKES ME

04:20:47.264 --> 04:20:48.299
UNCOMFORTABLE BUT IT I'M

04:20:48.366 --> 04:20:49.433
WILLING TO MOVE IN THAT

04:20:49.500 --> 04:20:50.634
DIRECTION AND THAT'S HOW I NEED

04:20:50.701 --> 04:20:51.369
TO MOVE TO CONTINUE THE

04:20:51.435 --> 04:20:52.970
DISCUSSION. BUT EITHER WAY MY

04:20:53.037 --> 04:20:53.871
COMMITMENT IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW

04:20:53.938 --> 04:20:55.740

DISABILITY RIGHTS GROUPS ARE

04:20:59.210 --> 04:21:00.711
ABLE TO COME IN AND HELP DEFINE

04:21:00.778 --> 04:21:02.213
WHAT THAT IS. AND THE ANSWER

04:21:02.279 --> 04:21:03.314
HAS BEEN THAT AT THIS POINT

04:21:03.381 --> 04:21:04.915
THEY HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME.

04:21:04.982 --> 04:21:05.816
TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND THEY

04:21:05.883 --> 04:21:11.322
HAVE ASKED FOR MORE. TIME UNTIL

04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:12.123
I THINK THE INITIALS ASIAN FROM

04:21:12.189 --> 04:21:12.790
MY AND THEIR- THIS. WHETHER

04:21:12.857 --> 04:21:13.724

SELF DETERMINATION. AND SO MANY

04:21:50.461 --> 04:21:52.930
TIMES IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS THEY

04:21:52.997 --> 04:21:55.966
ARE MET WITH RESISTANCE FROM A

04:21:56.033 --> 04:21:58.102
DOMINANT SOCIETY THAT IS

04:21:58.169 --> 04:22:01.138
PROJECTING NORMS ONTO THEM WITH

04:22:01.205 --> 04:22:04.842

TO BE INVOLVED IN. ADULT

04:22:26.530 --> 04:22:29.500
RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THERE'S

04:22:29.567 --> 04:22:33.971
THIS PAROCHIAL. PATRONIZING

04:22:34.038 --> 04:22:37.475
ASSUMPTION. THAT THEY CAN'T

04:22:37.541 --> 04:22:41.245
MAKE IT WITHOUT US. OVERSEEING

04:22:41.312 --> 04:22:43.414

TRAITS AND BEHAVIORS MEAN TO

04:22:55.392 --> 04:22:57.294
SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE SPECTRUM

NORMAL AND WHAT IS OKAY AND SO.

04:23:05.469 --> 04:23:07.471
VERY RARELY DO WE HAVE

04:23:07.538 --> 04:23:08.439
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE

04:23:08.506 --> 04:23:10.774

BECAUSE- AND IT'S NOT ABOUT THE

04:23:23.888 --> 04:23:27.291
RATE BUT IT IS ABOUT SEX. AND

04:23:27.358 --> 04:23:30.461
THEY DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO

04:23:30.528 --> 04:23:33.063
ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN A

04:23:33.130 --> 04:23:34.965
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT SEX IS

04:23:35.032 --> 04:23:38.135
FOR THEM. I TOTALLY GET WHEN

04:23:38.202 --> 04:23:39.603

04:23:44.141 --> 04:23:46.010
THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT WHAT

04:23:46.076 --> 04:23:47.745

SEASON NUANCES AND CREVICES

04:23:51.448 --> 04:23:52.883
THAT GENERALLY DON'T GET THE

04:23:52.950 --> 04:23:53.984
LIGHT WHICH IS WHY I DO

04:23:54.051 --> 04:23:55.920
APPRECIATE THIS BILL. COMING

04:23:55.986 --> 04:23:57.354

04:23:57.421 --> 04:23:58.455
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE

04:23:58.522 --> 04:23:59.690
DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT VERY

04:23:59.757 --> 04:24:02.126
OFTEN SO I AM ASKING THAT YOU

04:24:02.193 --> 04:24:05.129
CONTINUE TO. WE ENGAGE IN

04:24:05.196 --> 04:24:07.498
DISCUSSIONS WITH ARM. THE

04:24:07.565 --> 04:24:07.965
STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE

04:24:08.032 --> 04:24:10.301
DISABILITY COMMUNITY. IF FOR NO

04:24:10.367 --> 04:24:13.003
OTHER REASON. THAN BECAUSE THIS

04:24:13.070 --> 04:24:14.972
SENATOR HAS A CHILD. WHO

04:24:15.039 --> 04:24:18.008
DESERVES TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE

04:24:18.075 --> 04:24:22.580
TABLE WHEN DISCUSSING HOW HE-

04:24:22.646 --> 04:24:24.715
IS ABLE TO LIVE AND I WOULD

04:24:24.782 --> 04:24:26.750
SAY- I THINK WE ALL MAYBE NEED

04:24:26.817 --> 04:24:27.685
TO GET A LITTLE MORE EMOTIONAL

04:24:27.751 --> 04:24:28.819
ABOUT THIS THAT TO HAVE THESE

04:24:28.886 --> 04:24:30.654
DISCUSSIONS AND WE DO NEED TO

04:24:30.721 --> 04:24:31.789
HAVE THIS IS THAT DOESN'T HAVE

04:24:31.855 --> 04:24:32.556
THE DISCUSSION WITH THE

04:24:32.623 --> 04:24:34.024
STAKEHOLDERS THAT THIS AFFECTS

04:24:34.091 --> 04:24:37.528
OUT THERE- I AGREE THAT WE MUST

04:24:37.595 --> 04:24:39.930
UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS TRUE

04:24:39.997 --> 04:24:42.466
AND- I SURE WOULD DO THE

04:24:42.533 --> 04:24:44.034
FRUSTRATIONS OF HOW WE DEAL

04:24:44.101 --> 04:24:44.735
WITH THIS WITH OUR

04:24:44.802 --> 04:24:46.503
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND-

04:24:46.570 --> 04:24:48.072
THERE HAS TO BE A SPACE FOR

04:24:48.138 --> 04:24:49.807
MYSELF DETERMINATION AND THAT

04:24:49.873 --> 04:24:52.042
SPACE I FULLY BELIEVE IN THAT.

04:24:52.109 --> 04:24:53.110
I THINK IN GENERAL- TAKING THIS

04:24:53.177 --> 04:24:54.745
ATTITUDE OF PUTTING PEOPLE AWAY

04:24:54.812 --> 04:24:56.814
AND HIDING THEM IN AND NOT

04:24:56.880 --> 04:24:57.815
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE BUT WE

04:24:57.881 --> 04:24:59.116
NEED TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION

04:24:59.183 --> 04:25:01.885
OVER TO BE FAIR- TO ALL

04:25:01.952 --> 04:25:02.987
INDIVIDUALS TO BE INCLUSIVE

04:25:03.053 --> 04:25:04.188

04:25:07.458 --> 04:25:10.027
A DISCUSSION BEFORE THIS BILL

04:25:10.094 --> 04:25:11.161
IF I EVER GET TO THE GOVERNOR

04:25:11.228 --> 04:25:12.963
THIS YEAR OR A NEW BILL NEXT

04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:14.164
CHECK ME THAT COME IN THAT

04:25:14.231 --> 04:25:16.267
COMMITMENT TO- THE DISABILITY

04:25:16.333 --> 04:25:18.569
GROUPS US THAT WHATEVER WE COME

04:25:18.636 --> 04:25:19.603
UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE

04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:20.871
COMFORTABLE WITH THE LESSONS

04:25:20.938 --> 04:25:24.942
THEY BOTH YES. AND NO- AND IT'S

04:25:25.009 --> 04:25:26.010
FAIR THAT WE HAVE IN FIGURE

04:25:26.076 --> 04:25:27.945
THAT OUT AT THIS POINT AND THE

04:25:28.012 --> 04:25:29.847
LAST THE IN MY DISCUSSION THE

04:25:29.913 --> 04:25:31.282

04:25:31.348 --> 04:25:32.583
MOVING WITH THAT WHAT THE

04:25:32.650 --> 04:25:33.484
COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO

04:25:33.550 --> 04:25:34.952
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT FOR THIS

04:25:35.019 --> 04:25:36.553
TO BUY THEIR TEN AMENDMENT DOWN

TO WALK AWAY FROM THAT

04:25:48.632 --> 04:25:50.234
COMMITMENT. BUT I ALSO FEEL

04:25:50.301 --> 04:25:52.169
IT'S A HAVE TO DO IT ON HUNDRED

04:25:54.805 --> 04:25:55.939
NEUTRAL POSITIONS COMING FROM

04:25:56.006 --> 04:25:57.341

OTHER THAN THAT I DO KNOW THAT

04:26:05.282 --> 04:26:06.216
WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND

04:26:06.283 --> 04:26:07.718
ALLOWING SELF DETERMINATION FOR

04:26:07.785 --> 04:26:10.187
INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE AND SO-

04:26:10.254 --> 04:26:11.689
WHATEVER THE DISABILITY IS THIS

04:26:11.755 --> 04:26:13.657
I MEAN THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE

04:26:13.724 --> 04:26:20.197

YEAR NOT MY- BECAUSE FIGURE OUT

04:26:24.735 --> 04:26:26.770
A BETTER SPACE AND IS NOT JUST.

04:26:26.837 --> 04:26:28.305
ON ISSUES OF SEX BUT JUST IN

04:26:28.372 --> 04:26:31.975
GENERAL- HOW WE TREAT THIS AND THERE'S A LOT OF

04:26:32.042 --> 04:26:34.545
WORK TO BE DONE IN THAT SPACE.

04:26:34.611 --> 04:26:36.013
THIS IS DIFFICULT VERY CAPABLE

04:26:36.080 --> 04:26:38.048
GAIN IF I COULD BRIEFLY RESPOND

04:26:38.115 --> 04:26:39.583
TO THE VERY IMPORTANT AND

04:26:39.650 --> 04:26:42.953
PERSONAL- QUESTIONS AND STORIES

04:26:43.020 --> 04:26:44.221
THAT THAT CENTER CAMARGO

04:26:44.288 --> 04:26:45.823
SHARED- BECAUSE I THINK SHE

04:26:45.889 --> 04:26:47.458
REYES REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES I

04:26:47.524 --> 04:26:49.026
WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THEM

04:26:49.093 --> 04:26:51.795
THANK HER. AS WELL FOR SHARING

04:26:51.862 --> 04:26:53.430
AND HER CONTRIBUTION ON THESE

04:26:53.497 --> 04:26:55.566
ISSUES- AND ALSO EXPRESSED BY

04:26:55.632 --> 04:26:56.834
COMMITMENT TO SELF

04:26:56.900 --> 04:26:57.868
DETERMINATION I HAVE MANY

04:26:57.935 --> 04:26:59.636
FAMILY MEMBERS AND STAFF

04:26:59.703 --> 04:27:01.138
MEMBERS IN MY OFFICE AS WELL

04:27:01.205 --> 04:27:03.540
WHO ARE DISABLED- AND I THINK

04:27:03.607 --> 04:27:06.009
IT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT IS.

04:27:06.076 --> 04:27:07.378
AS YOU SAY OFTEN OVERLOOKED

04:27:07.444 --> 04:27:09.346
GETTING EXCLUDED FROM THIS

04:27:09.413 --> 04:27:10.114
CONVERSATION ABOUT SEXUAL

04:27:10.180 --> 04:27:13.083
IDENTITY AND SEXUAL CONSENT AND

04:27:13.150 --> 04:27:16.153
BEYOND- I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR

04:27:16.220 --> 04:27:18.255
AND TRY TO FOCUS ON WHY HE IS

04:27:18.322 --> 04:27:19.757
THE REAL QUESTION WHEN IT COMES

04:27:19.823 --> 04:27:23.494
TO- THIS ASSMBLY BILL. THIS IS

04:27:23.560 --> 04:27:24.661
NOT AN ASSEMBLY BILL THAT OULD

04:27:24.728 --> 04:27:27.531
IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE LEGAL

04:27:27.598 --> 04:27:29.700
STANDARD FOR WHAT PROSECUTORS

04:27:29.767 --> 04:27:30.868
IN A COURT OF LAW HAVE TO

04:27:30.934 --> 04:27:33.170
PROVE. TO SECURE A CRIMINAL

04:27:33.237 --> 04:27:35.239
CONVICTION FOR RAPE IT DOESN'T

04:27:35.305 --> 04:27:39.109
CHANGE THAT. AND IT WOULD NOT

04:27:39.176 --> 04:27:40.277
IN ANY WAY ALTER. OR ELIMINATE.

04:27:40.344 --> 04:27:42.946
A VERY LONGSTANDING WELL

04:27:43.013 --> 04:27:45.015
ESTABLISHED LEGAL DEFENSE TO

04:27:45.082 --> 04:27:47.017
SEXUAL ASSAULT WHICH IS KNOWN

04:27:47.084 --> 04:27:48.786
AS THE MAYBERRY THANKS TO THE

04:27:48.852 --> 04:27:51.488
FENCE WHICH- ESSENTIALLY-

04:27:51.555 --> 04:27:53.857
REQUIRES PROSECUTORS. TO

04:27:53.924 --> 04:27:55.225
ELIMINATE THE REASONABLE

04:27:55.292 --> 04:27:59.263
POSSIBILITY. THAT THE PERSON

04:27:59.329 --> 04:28:01.298
ACCUSED THOUGHT. THE VICTIM

04:28:01.365 --> 04:28:04.401
CONSENTED. IT IS OUR BURDEN AS

04:28:04.468 --> 04:28:06.270
PROSECUTORS IN EVERY SINGLE

04:28:06.336 --> 04:28:08.605
CASE WITH OR WITHOUT THIS

04:28:08.672 --> 04:28:11.208
CHANGE IN A LONG. TO ESTABLISH

04:28:11.275 --> 04:28:13.377
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT

04:28:13.444 --> 04:28:14.812
THERE WAS NO CONSENT AND THAT

04:28:14.878 --> 04:28:16.613
THE PERSON ACCUSED COULD NOT

04:28:16.680 --> 04:28:18.282
HAVE REASONABLY BELIEVED THERE

04:28:18.348 --> 04:28:20.584
WAS CONSENT. MEETING THAT

04:28:20.651 --> 04:28:22.953
BURDEN IS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT

04:28:23.020 --> 04:28:24.788
THANKS MANY ARGUE MANY BELIEVE

04:28:24.855 --> 04:28:26.690
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT AND THAT'S

04:28:26.757 --> 04:28:28.225
WHY SO MUCH SEXUAL ASSAULT GOES

04:28:28.292 --> 04:28:29.593
ON PUNISHED BUT WHAT IS

04:28:29.660 --> 04:28:31.695
CERTAINLY TRUE IS IT IS

04:28:31.762 --> 04:28:33.730
UNIQUELY DIFFICULT IN CASES.

04:28:33.797 --> 04:28:36.967
WHERE BOTH PEOPLE ENGAGING IN

04:28:37.034 --> 04:28:39.136
SEX ACTS ARE DISABLED

04:28:39.203 --> 04:28:43.307
ESTABLISHING. A JURY THAT.

04:28:43.373 --> 04:28:45.175
BACKS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

04:28:45.242 --> 04:28:47.044
WAS NON CONSENSUAL AND

04:28:47.110 --> 04:28:48.479
ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITY

04:28:48.545 --> 04:28:50.848
THAT IT WAS CONSENSUAL IS OFTEN

04:28:50.914 --> 04:28:52.950
AN INSURMOUNTABLE BURDEN THIS

04:28:53.016 --> 04:28:54.518
LAW WOULD NOT THIS PROPOSAL

04:28:54.585 --> 04:28:56.153
THIS ASSEMBLY BILL WOULD NOT IN

04:28:56.220 --> 04:28:58.388
ANY WAY CHANGE THAT LOFTY

04:28:58.455 --> 04:28:59.256
BURDEN SO I JUST WANT TO BE

04:28:59.323 --> 04:29:01.525
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT DOES AND

04:29:01.592 --> 04:29:02.726
DOES NOT DO I ALSO WANT TO

04:29:02.793 --> 04:29:04.361
EXPRESS MY COMMITMENT TO

04:29:04.428 --> 04:29:06.096
WORKING WITH SENATOR TOM LONGER

04:29:06.163 --> 04:29:09.666
AND THE SENATE IN GENERAL ON.

04:29:09.733 --> 04:29:10.834
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION BRING

04:29:10.901 --> 04:29:12.536
IT OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND

04:29:12.603 --> 04:29:14.505
INCLUDING- DISABLED MEMBERS OUR

04:29:14.571 --> 04:29:17.574
FAMILIES OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH

04:29:17.641 --> 04:29:18.108
YOU TO THE TABLE THANK YOU

04:29:18.175 --> 04:29:20.577
THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL

04:29:20.644 --> 04:29:21.178
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FOR THIS

04:29:21.245 --> 04:29:25.949
CORRECT. WELL I I'D- M. THE

04:29:26.016 --> 04:29:27.784
THANKFUL AND I WANT TO

04:29:27.851 --> 04:29:29.853
ACKNOWLEDGE AND FULL DISCLOSURE

04:29:29.920 --> 04:29:30.621
THAT I ACTUALLY HAD A

04:29:30.687 --> 04:29:32.089
CONVERSATION WITH THE DA OVER

04:29:32.155 --> 04:29:33.957
THE WEEKEND ABOUT THIS BILL BUT

04:29:34.024 --> 04:29:36.059
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT

04:29:36.126 --> 04:29:40.097
RENEGADES THE ABILITY FOR CALM.

04:29:40.163 --> 04:29:41.598
FOLKS WITH DIFF DEVELOPMENTAL

04:29:41.665 --> 04:29:44.034
DISABILITIES FROM CONSENTING

04:29:44.101 --> 04:29:47.271
AND SO MY CONCERN IS IT TOO

04:29:47.337 --> 04:29:48.872
LATE WHERE ESPOUSES INCAPABLE

04:29:48.939 --> 04:29:51.174
OF GIVING LEGAL CONSENT DUE TO

04:29:51.241 --> 04:29:52.943
A DISABILITY DO YOU KNOW LIKE

04:29:53.010 --> 04:29:54.811
WHAT THE STANDARD IS SO

04:29:54.878 --> 04:29:58.615
BECAUSE- ONCE AGAIN IN MANY

04:29:58.682 --> 04:30:01.285
INSTANCES. THE COUPLE BOTH OF

04:30:01.351 --> 04:30:04.555
THEM. CAN HAVE IF THEY BOTH

04:30:04.621 --> 04:30:07.124
HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY

04:30:07.190 --> 04:30:15.699
HOW DOES THAT PLAY OUT. SENATOR

04:30:15.766 --> 04:30:17.968
THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT IN ANY

04:30:18.035 --> 04:30:19.102
CRIMINAL CASE CERTAINLY

04:30:19.169 --> 04:30:20.837
INCLUDING THESE KINDS OF

04:30:20.904 --> 04:30:25.242
CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS THE BURDEN

04:30:25.309 --> 04:30:26.643
OF THE PROSECUTOR THE BURDEN OF

04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:27.878
FOR EXAMPLE THE LAWYERS MY

04:30:27.945 --> 04:30:28.946
OFFICE OR ANY OTHER DISTRICT

04:30:29.012 --> 04:30:30.981
ATTORNEY OFFICES ACROSS THE

04:30:31.048 --> 04:30:32.849
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN

04:30:32.916 --> 04:30:34.451
FILING A CRIMINAL CASE IT IS

04:30:34.518 --> 04:30:37.087
OUR BURDEN TO ESTABLISH EACH

04:30:37.154 --> 04:30:39.556
AND EVERY ELEMENT OF. THE

04:30:39.623 --> 04:30:41.124
PARTICULAR CRIME CHARGED BUT

04:30:41.191 --> 04:30:42.225
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RAPE FOR

04:30:42.292 --> 04:30:44.494
EXAMPLE IT WOULD BE OUR BURDEN

04:30:44.561 --> 04:30:45.862
TO PROVE THE TEXAS COURT IT

04:30:45.929 --> 04:30:47.197
WILL BE OUR BURDEN OF PROOF TO

04:30:47.264 --> 04:30:48.899
PROVE THAT THE SEX WAS NON

04:30:48.966 --> 04:30:51.101
CONSENSUAL IT WILL BE OUR

04:30:51.168 --> 04:30:53.303
BURDEN TO PROVE. THAT NOT ONLY

04:30:53.370 --> 04:30:54.638
WAS NON CONSENSUAL SEX BUT THAT

04:30:54.705 --> 04:30:56.974
THE PERSON ACCUSED COULD NOT

04:30:57.040 --> 04:31:00.110
HAVE REASONABLY BELIEVES. THAT

04:31:00.177 --> 04:31:02.212
IT WAS CONSENSUAL SEX. IN MANY

04:31:02.279 --> 04:31:03.580
INSTANCES EVEN IF THERE'S A

04:31:03.647 --> 04:31:05.782
CONSERVATORSHIP IN PLACE FOR

04:31:05.849 --> 04:31:06.550
ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

04:31:06.617 --> 04:31:08.085
ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH THAT'S NOT

04:31:08.151 --> 04:31:10.187
SUFFICIENT. IN OTHER WORDS WE

04:31:10.253 --> 04:31:12.556
HAVE THE VERY DIFFICULT OFTEN

04:31:12.623 --> 04:31:13.490
IMPOSSIBLE BURDEN AS

04:31:13.557 --> 04:31:16.059
PROSECUTORS IF WE CHOOSE TO

04:31:16.126 --> 04:31:18.095
FILE RAPE CHARGES. OTHER

04:31:18.161 --> 04:31:19.463
SALVAGING THAT A PERSON EVEN A

04:31:19.529 --> 04:31:21.231
PERSON WAS SEVERE DISABILITIES

04:31:21.298 --> 04:31:23.133
COULD NOT HAVE REASONABLY

04:31:23.200 --> 04:31:25.736
UNDERSTOOD. THAT THE PERSON

04:31:25.802 --> 04:31:28.138
THEY HAD SEX WITH- WHO WAS

04:31:28.205 --> 04:31:30.707
CONTENT. IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE

04:31:30.774 --> 04:31:32.109
TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY

04:31:32.175 --> 04:31:34.244
THE REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT

04:31:34.311 --> 04:31:36.380
THE ALLEGED VICTIM COULD HAVE

04:31:36.446 --> 04:31:40.050
BEEN. IN CENTER. A DIFFICULT

04:31:40.117 --> 04:31:41.284
BURDEN IT'S ACTUALLY MORE

04:31:41.351 --> 04:31:42.285
DIFFICULT IN CASES WHERE

04:31:42.352 --> 04:31:44.287
DISABILITIES ARE INVOLVED NOT

04:31:44.354 --> 04:31:46.690
BECAUSE WE UNDERMINE THE SEXUAL

04:31:46.757 --> 04:31:49.993
IDENTITY OR SEXUAL AUTONOMY OF

04:31:50.060 --> 04:31:51.428
DISABLED PEOPLE I THINK YOU'RE

04:31:51.495 --> 04:31:53.196
RIGHT THAT WE DO AS A SOCIETY

04:31:53.263 --> 04:31:54.731
BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE

04:31:54.798 --> 04:31:56.600
FROM THIS LEGAL REFORM LEGAL

04:31:56.667 --> 04:31:59.503
REFORM IS REALLY JUST LOOKING

04:31:59.569 --> 04:32:00.070
AT. WHETHER RAPE IS RAPE IT

04:32:00.137 --> 04:32:02.506
DOESN'T. THE LEGAL STANDARD FOR

04:32:02.572 --> 04:32:04.041
PROVING IT IF IT'S IF IT'S A

04:32:04.107 --> 04:32:06.009
LEAD. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE

04:32:06.076 --> 04:32:07.377
INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO

04:32:07.444 --> 04:32:08.211
ALLEGED CORRECTLY OR

04:32:08.278 --> 04:32:10.213
INCORRECTLY WHAT IT DOES IS

04:32:10.280 --> 04:32:12.382
CREATE A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF

04:32:12.449 --> 04:32:14.084
RESPONSE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY

04:32:14.151 --> 04:32:16.586
WHEN RATE. CAN BE PROVED IT.

04:32:16.653 --> 04:32:18.588
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IT HAPPENS

04:32:18.655 --> 04:32:20.524
FAR FAR FAR MORE OFTEN. THAT IT

04:32:20.590 --> 04:32:25.629
CAN BE PROVEN BY PROSECUTORS.

04:32:25.696 --> 04:32:26.797
WELL NO I THINK YOU FOR THAT

04:32:26.863 --> 04:32:29.499
BUT I WE WERE TALKING I WAS

04:32:29.566 --> 04:32:31.168
THINKING BACK TO A CASE THAT

04:32:31.234 --> 04:32:36.506
WAS- TRIED IN MY COUNTY- FROM-

04:32:36.573 --> 04:32:40.777
A FORMER DA- AND- THE PERSON

04:32:40.844 --> 04:32:42.846
THE YOUNG MAN DID HAVE A DEBOUT

04:32:42.913 --> 04:32:44.448
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND

04:32:44.514 --> 04:32:46.216
WAS CHARGED WITH RAPE AND HE

04:32:46.283 --> 04:32:47.150
THEN THAT WAS NOT WHAT

04:32:47.217 --> 04:32:49.286
HAPPENED- AND IN FACT THE- THE

04:32:49.352 --> 04:32:51.788
PROSECUTION SAID. WE KNOW HE

04:32:51.855 --> 04:32:54.424
DOESN'T NEED JAIL- BECAUSE WE

04:32:54.491 --> 04:32:56.827
KNOW HE HAS A MENTAL-

04:32:56.893 --> 04:32:59.563
DISABILITY- BUT WE'RE GOING TO

04:32:59.629 --> 04:33:01.698
CHARGE HIM ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS

04:33:01.765 --> 04:33:05.736
IS AN EASY WIN. ARM AND SO I E.

04:33:05.802 --> 04:33:09.005
II DO WHAT AID YOU KNOW I DID

04:33:09.072 --> 04:33:11.375
IT SO I MEAN THAT'S JUST THAT'S

04:33:11.441 --> 04:33:13.910
THE REAL STORY SO I'M AS AND I

04:33:13.977 --> 04:33:15.312
WOULD HATE FOR SOMETHING LIKE

04:33:15.378 --> 04:33:17.114
THIS TO BE PREDICATED ON WHO

04:33:17.180 --> 04:33:19.950
THE D. EIGHT IS- BECAUSE AND

04:33:20.016 --> 04:33:21.818
WE'RE PUTTING OUR EGGS YOU KNOW

04:33:21.885 --> 04:33:23.553
QUITE FRANKLY IN YOUR BASKET IN

04:33:23.620 --> 04:33:24.488
IN A COUPLE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S

04:33:24.554 --> 04:33:26.323
BASKETS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

04:33:26.389 --> 04:33:28.759
FAITH IN. THERE ARE AND I

04:33:28.825 --> 04:33:29.826
APPRECIATE THAT BATES SENATOR

04:33:29.893 --> 04:33:32.028
AND- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I

04:33:32.095 --> 04:33:33.263
DON'T THINK THIS LAW WOULD

04:33:33.330 --> 04:33:35.031
CHANGE THE STORY THAT YOU

04:33:35.098 --> 04:33:36.767
DESCRIBE. I MEAN IF THEY WERE

04:33:36.833 --> 04:33:38.702
LEGALLY MARRIED. OUR GALLAGHER

04:33:38.769 --> 04:33:40.003
WE'RE GOOD AT MAYBE IT WOULD

04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:43.106
BE. WELL I THINK HI G. OF

04:33:43.173 --> 04:33:47.277
COURSE ON THE CENTER. TROUBLE

04:33:47.344 --> 04:33:52.048
CONDUCTOR CENTER SKINNER. OKAY

04:33:52.115 --> 04:33:53.984
RIGHT WILL LOOK LET ME LET ME

OPPOSITION OF THE BILL THAT THE

04:34:17.307 --> 04:34:19.242

WHICH WOULD REMOVE SPOUSAL RAPE

04:34:42.499 --> 04:34:43.667
AND THAT'S THE INTENT OF THIS

04:34:43.733 --> 04:34:46.303
BILL TO REMOVE THAT COLD AND

04:34:46.369 --> 04:34:48.805
EVERYONE HERE SUPPORTS THE OVER

04:34:48.872 --> 04:34:52.042
ARCHING GOALS OF THIS. BILL AND

04:34:52.108 --> 04:34:53.009
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE

04:34:53.076 --> 04:34:55.512
HERE- THE MEMBERS SHOULD NOT

04:34:55.579 --> 04:34:56.613
ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS THAT

04:34:56.680 --> 04:34:57.514
HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE

04:34:57.581 --> 04:34:59.416
OPPOSITION WE'RE NOT HERE TO

04:34:59.482 --> 04:35:00.917
SAY THAT IT DOES BUT THIS BILL

04:35:00.984 --> 04:35:03.353
REMOVES DISCRETION OF JUDGES TO

04:35:03.420 --> 04:35:05.589

REQUIRE MANDATORY LIFETIME SEX

04:35:08.258 --> 04:35:11.228
REGISTRATION AND AGAIN IT'S NOT

04:35:11.294 --> 04:35:11.728
A SINGLE PERSON HERE WHO

04:35:11.795 --> 04:35:14.564
CONDONES RAPE- I HOPE IT'S NO

04:35:14.631 --> 04:35:15.832
ONE IN THIS BUILDING AND I'LL

04:35:15.899 --> 04:35:17.868
NO ONE ANYWHERE AROUND HERE

04:35:17.934 --> 04:35:20.103
WOULD DO THAT BUT I THINK THE-

04:35:20.170 --> 04:35:23.139
BILL ALSO A SILENT ON THE FACT

04:35:23.206 --> 04:35:24.608
THAT. MEN ARE REAP TO. AND ALL

04:35:24.674 --> 04:35:26.476
THE TESTIMONY ONLY SPEAKS TO

04:35:26.543 --> 04:35:28.478
WOMEN BEING RAPED AND MEN ARE

04:35:28.545 --> 04:35:30.614
BEING RAPED EVERY DAY. IN THIS

04:35:30.680 --> 04:35:32.282
COUNTRY AND IT SPEAKS NOTHING

04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:33.850
THIS AWARD IS A STAND AS IT

04:35:33.917 --> 04:35:38.588
RELATES TO MEN BEING HURT. A

04:35:38.655 --> 04:35:41.324
CASE LET MYSELF WITH. MEN ARE

04:35:41.391 --> 04:35:43.059
DEFINITELY RATES AS WELL IT'S

04:35:43.126 --> 04:35:45.161
THIS IS AN THE GENDER DOESN'T

04:35:45.228 --> 04:35:47.364
MATTER AND IT'S ABOUT POWER OUR

04:35:47.430 --> 04:35:50.667
NEXT. AND SO IT'S NOT MY INTENT

04:35:50.734 --> 04:35:51.935
TO THAT ONLY A IT'S ONLY IF YOU

04:35:52.002 --> 04:35:54.004
KNOW FOR WOMEN I THINK IT

04:35:54.070 --> 04:35:55.405
SPEAKS BILL OR THE GENDER

04:35:55.472 --> 04:35:56.506
ROLLED IN THE PAR THEN I MIX

04:35:56.573 --> 04:35:57.574
THAT WE'RE WORKING TO BRING

04:35:57.641 --> 04:35:59.509
PARITY. TO AND THE WORDS THAT

04:35:59.576 --> 04:36:01.611
WE USE THAT TIME SO I WOULD

04:36:01.678 --> 04:36:02.512
START WITH THAT PIECE THE

04:36:02.579 --> 04:36:03.680
SECOND PIECE I WOULD SAY WITH

04:36:03.747 --> 04:36:06.416
THE AMENDMENT. THAT YOU JUST

04:36:06.483 --> 04:36:08.518
DESCRIBED I THINK IT DEFINITELY

04:36:08.585 --> 04:36:11.087
ALLOWS FOR YES- AND A SEARCH TO

04:36:11.154 --> 04:36:13.523
ADDRESS HALF OF THE ISSUE AND

04:36:13.590 --> 04:36:14.858
PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

04:36:14.925 --> 04:36:17.160
BUT IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR NOW

04:36:17.227 --> 04:36:21.331
YES HE DOES. WHAT WE'RE GONNA

04:36:21.398 --> 04:36:21.798
DO DISAGREE ON THAT IT

04:36:21.865 --> 04:36:24.668
DEFINITELY LAWS FOR NOW. IT'S A-

04:36:24.734 --> 04:36:27.270
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND

04:36:27.337 --> 04:36:30.140
TALKING TO FOLKS AND IN TALKING

04:36:30.206 --> 04:36:30.807
TO THE DISABILITIES GROUPS THAT

04:36:30.874 --> 04:36:36.780
IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR NOEL. LET

04:36:36.846 --> 04:36:40.050
THE COUNCIL TWENTY. IT WOULD

04:36:40.116 --> 04:36:41.418
STILL ALLOW FOR SOMEONE TO BE

04:36:41.484 --> 04:36:45.555
RAPED SO JUST SO IF THE MAN IT

04:36:45.622 --> 04:36:47.424
MAKES IT SO THAT A PERSON WITH

04:36:47.490 --> 04:36:49.993
DISABILITIES IS NOT PRESUME TO

04:36:50.060 --> 04:36:51.661
NOT BE ABLE TO CONSENT WITHIN A

04:36:51.728 --> 04:36:53.330
MARRIAGE WHICH IS WHAT THIS

04:36:53.396 --> 04:36:53.797
BILL DOES IT MAKES IT

04:36:53.863 --> 04:36:56.366
STATUTORILY JUST AS WE SAY

04:36:56.433 --> 04:36:57.133
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CAN'T CAN'T

04:36:57.200 --> 04:36:59.035
CAN'T CONSENT. UNLESS THEY'RE

04:36:59.102 --> 04:37:00.337
MARRIED. IF THEY'RE MARRIED

04:37:00.403 --> 04:37:04.541
THEY CAN. BUT IT DOES IT DOES

04:37:04.607 --> 04:37:05.742
NOT CHANGE RATE A PERSON CAN

04:37:05.809 --> 04:37:07.210
STILL BE CHARGED WITH RAPE IF

04:37:07.277 --> 04:37:09.779
THE IF THE IF THE PERSON WITH

04:37:09.846 --> 04:37:11.715
THE DISABILITY SAYS. I DIDN'T

04:37:11.781 --> 04:37:14.317
CONSENT I A T. ATTACKED ME THIS

04:37:14.384 --> 04:37:16.386
OR ANY OF THE OTHER THINGS IF

04:37:16.453 --> 04:37:18.121
THE PERSON IS DISABILITY SAYS I

04:37:18.188 --> 04:37:20.256
DIDN'T CONSENT IT'S STILL GREAT

04:37:20.323 --> 04:37:22.058
EVEN UNDER THE AMENDMENT WHAT

04:37:22.125 --> 04:37:23.159
THE SOME BUT WHAT YOUR BILL

04:37:23.226 --> 04:37:25.095
CURRENTLY SAYS THE PERSON WITH

04:37:25.161 --> 04:37:27.130
DISABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED TO

04:37:27.197 --> 04:37:29.132
CONSENT EVEN IN THE PICTURE OF

04:37:29.199 --> 04:37:31.634
MARCH. AND SO THIS JUST REMAINS

04:37:31.701 --> 04:37:34.371
REMOVES FAT JUST AS A FIFTEEN

04:37:34.437 --> 04:37:35.605
OR SIXTEEN YEAR OLD CANNOT

04:37:35.672 --> 04:37:37.741
CONSENT BUT IF THEY'RE MARRIED

04:37:37.807 --> 04:37:41.277
LAW RECOGNIZES. THEM IN

04:37:41.344 --> 04:37:41.911
MARRIAGE AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

04:37:41.978 --> 04:37:43.179
CONSENT. BECAUSE OCCASIONALLY

04:37:43.246 --> 04:37:44.981
THEY GET MARRIED SO THIS IS

04:37:45.048 --> 04:37:48.151
THIS BILL ALL IT DOES IS REMOVE.

04:37:48.218 --> 04:37:50.220
THE AMENDMENT THAT SAYS PEOPLE

04:37:50.286 --> 04:37:51.955
WITH DISABILITIES EVEN WITHIN

04:37:52.022 --> 04:37:55.025
MARRIAGE CANNOT CONSENT IF THE

04:37:55.091 --> 04:37:57.394
PERSON SAYS MY HUSBAND RAPED ME.

04:37:57.460 --> 04:37:58.828
THEY CAN STILL BE CHARGED WITH

04:37:58.895 --> 04:38:00.463
RAPE JUST LIKE THEY CAN UNDER

04:38:00.530 --> 04:38:03.666
EXISTING LAW. SO IT JUST SAYS

04:38:03.733 --> 04:38:05.168
IT JUST TAKES AWAY THE

04:38:05.235 --> 04:38:06.903
PRESUMPTION THAT THERE IS NOT

04:38:06.970 --> 04:38:09.773
CONSENT. I WOULD SAY THAT IN MY

04:38:09.839 --> 04:38:10.774

04:38:16.880 --> 04:38:18.782
ADDRESS THE OF THE YES SIDE OF

04:38:18.848 --> 04:38:20.383
THE EQUATION BUT NOT THE NORTH

04:38:20.450 --> 04:38:21.584
SIDE OF THE EQUATION WHY

04:38:21.651 --> 04:38:22.552
THEY'VE ASKED FOR MORE TIME

04:38:22.619 --> 04:38:24.054

04:38:24.120 --> 04:38:25.688

STAKEHOLDERS AND- AT ENSURING

04:38:40.203 --> 04:38:41.671
THAT WE ARE CREATING A BETTER

04:38:41.738 --> 04:38:45.809
SYSTEM THERE ARE AND I HAD IF

04:38:45.875 --> 04:38:47.110
THE AMENDMENT TO SET THOSE WITH

04:38:49.079 --> 04:38:51.981
AMENDMENTS- IN IF IT DOESN'T I

04:38:52.048 --> 04:38:53.483
WANTED TO FIND A SOLUTION

04:38:53.550 --> 04:38:54.884
WHETHER IT'S AT SOME POINT DOWN

04:38:54.951 --> 04:38:56.319
THE ROAD- AND I WANT TO MAKE

04:38:56.386 --> 04:38:57.554
SURE THAT OUR DISABILITY RIGHTS

04:38:57.620 --> 04:38:58.855
STAKEHOLDERS ARE COMFORTABLE

04:38:58.922 --> 04:39:01.357
WITH BUT THAT THAT'S IT IT DOES

04:39:01.424 --> 04:39:02.325
TAKE IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL

04:39:02.392 --> 04:39:05.061
WITH. GREAT IT JUST DEALS WITH

04:39:05.128 --> 04:39:06.996
THE IT JUST TAKES OUT THE OF

04:39:07.063 --> 04:39:08.865
THE STATEMENT IN YOUR BILL THAT

04:39:08.932 --> 04:39:11.668
SAYS A PERSON WITH DISABILITY

04:39:11.734 --> 04:39:13.303

04:39:13.369 --> 04:39:16.773
THIS A PERSON CAN. THAT IT DOES

04:39:16.840 --> 04:39:20.710
THAT HAVE TO BE CAPABLE TO. I'M

04:39:20.777 --> 04:39:22.378
SORRY I JUST I AM NOT AWARE OF

04:39:22.445 --> 04:39:23.847
ANY PRESUMPTION IN THE LAW THE

04:39:46.402 --> 04:39:47.937
OF ANY EXACTLY ALL RIGHT WELL

04:39:48.004 --> 04:39:49.005

04:40:02.185 --> 04:40:04.187
AND- IT'S FAIR AT THIS POINT

04:40:04.254 --> 04:40:06.256
THAT'S NOT MY YOU'RE TAKING THE

04:40:06.322 --> 04:40:08.858
MOMENTUM. IF IT'S FROM MY

04:40:08.925 --> 04:40:11.761
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE WITH THE

04:40:11.828 --> 04:40:14.797
DISABILITY RIGHTS. RUPE IT'S

TALKED TO WILL WE MUST B

04:40:19.402 --> 04:40:20.270
TALKING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS

04:40:20.336 --> 04:40:22.305
BECAUSE DISABILITY GROUPS SO

04:40:22.372 --> 04:40:24.007
WE'VE TALKED TO ARM APPROVED

04:40:24.073 --> 04:40:26.042
THIS LANGUAGE SO MAYBE IT'S

04:40:26.109 --> 04:40:27.510
DIFFERENT FACTIONS WITHIN THE

DISABILITY RIGHT COMMUNITY BUT

04:40:29.379 --> 04:40:30.580
I THINK WE'VE CRAFTED AN

04:40:30.647 --> 04:40:32.482
AMENDMENT THAT ACHIEVE YOUR

04:40:32.549 --> 04:40:35.552
GOAL IT'S- I THINK IT'S NOT NOT

04:40:35.618 --> 04:40:38.021
A MORE VILE DISGUSTING ACT.

04:40:38.087 --> 04:40:39.489
THAT YOU CAN COMMIT ON SOMEBODY

04:40:39.556 --> 04:40:41.891
RATE ABSENT MURDER ANYWAYS RAPE

04:40:41.958 --> 04:40:43.126
IS WORSE TO MURDER BECAUSE YOU

04:40:43.193 --> 04:40:45.061
HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT TRAUMA

04:40:45.128 --> 04:40:48.097
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. AND

04:40:48.164 --> 04:40:49.265
I HAVE. GIRLFRIEND EX

04:40:49.332 --> 04:40:51.000

IT PUT ON HER AND SHE STILL

04:40:54.337 --> 04:40:56.306
SUFFERS FROM THAT. TODAY BUT I

04:40:56.372 --> 04:40:58.374
ALSO HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE

04:40:58.441 --> 04:40:59.976
DISABLED AND HAVE FAMILY

04:41:00.043 --> 04:41:01.611
MEMBERS WHO ARE DISABLED COURT

04:41:01.678 --> 04:41:04.013
IN LOVING CARING RELATIONSHIPS

04:41:04.080 --> 04:41:05.782
AND I'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE

04:41:05.848 --> 04:41:06.649
LAST COUPLE MONTHS OF THEM

04:41:06.716 --> 04:41:08.251
INTERACTING. AND LEGACY IT'S

04:41:08.318 --> 04:41:09.285

04:41:09.352 --> 04:41:11.054
INTERACTION BUT- THEY

04:41:11.120 --> 04:41:13.823
COMMUNICATE. AND LOVE IN A WAY

04:41:13.890 --> 04:41:14.958
THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM
