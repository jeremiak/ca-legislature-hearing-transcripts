AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS CONTINUES TO GO MISSING AND MURDERED AND ACCOUNTED FOR. AJ ARE SEVENTEEN IS A RESOLUTION THAT REQUEST THE TOURNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA TO INVESTIGATE DATA AS IT RELATES TO MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN AND GIRLS. AMONG INDIAN WOMEN HOMICIDE IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG THOSE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TEN AND TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE AND IS THE FIFTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR TRIBAL WOMEN BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THE NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER FOUND THAT THERE WERE NEARLY SIX THOUSAND REPORTS OF MISSING NATIVE AMERICAN AND ALASKA NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE UNITED STATES BUT THE NATIONAL MISSING AN INDEMNIFIED UNIDENTIFIED PERSON SYSTEMS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. REPORT IT JUST ONLY SIXTEEN CASES. SO WE SEE THE DID THE DEEP DISPARITY THAT'S THERE BUT ALONG OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA IS NUMBER SIX IN THE TOP TEN STATES WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF MISSING AND MURDER NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN AND GIRLS WITH CASES. WITH SAN FRANCISCO AS ONE OF THE TOP TEN CITIES WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF MISSING AND MURDER NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE UNITED STATES GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY INTENSITY WITH THESE TYPES OF CASES IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANT THAT THIS BODY AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA IDENTIFY A MEDIA COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS TO ACCURATELY INVESTIGATING AND DOCUMENTING AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING TO SHARE BETWEEN FEDERAL STATE COUNTY AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES.

SB THIRTY SIX THE CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL THIRTY SIX BY SENATOR HERTZBERG AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY IN A PRE TRIAL RELEASE. DOCTOR WEBER EMAIL YES MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT TO YOU SB THIRTY SIX BY SENATOR HERTZBERG WHICH IS A BILL THAT IS INSPIRED BY NATIONAL MOVEMENT FOCUSING ON REFORMING OUR PRE TRIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ACROSS THE COUNTRY POLICY INNOVATORS IN SYSTEM ACTORS ARE RETHINKING HOW WE ACHIEVE EQUITY FOR THE ACCUSED IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN THEY ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME AND WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT TO TRIAL. IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES OF ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES CURRENTLY FORTY NINE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE ADOPTED A PRE TRIAL REST ASSESSMENT TOOL AIMED AT IMPROVING JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING AND PRE TRIAL SO PROVISION PRACTICES. THE PROBLEM IS AS THESE TOOLS ARE PRODUCED BY ALL MANNERS OF ORGANIZATIONS FROM NONPROFIT AND FOR PROFIT COMPANIES TO CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS AND THEY VERYDRAMATICALLY IN THAT METHODOLOGY THEY USE TO ASSESS RISK. MORE CONCERNING IS THE FACT THAT UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW THERE ARE NO MINIMAL STANDARDS GOVERNING THE EFFECTIVE USE OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND NO SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE BEING USED IN A WAY. THAT ACTUALLY IS ESTIMATES WRIST WHILE MINIMIZING BIAS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WITH SB THIRTY SIX WE'RE CREATING THREE MINIMAL STANDARDS REGARDING THE USE OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS ONE ANY COUNTY THAT USES A TOOL MUST VALIDATE THE STATISTICAL ACCURACY OF THAT TOOL ON A REGULAR BASIS. TO IN A TOOL USED IN CALIFORNIA MUST BE TRANSPARENT THAT MEANS OF COUNTY NEED TO TELL THE PUBLIC EXACTLY HOW THIS SCORES ARE CALCULATED. AND THREE DATA COLLECTION THROUGH THE USE OF THESE TOOLS MUST BE REGULAR COLLECTED AND PUBLISHED SO THAT THE SYSTEM ACTORS CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. RECENT AMENDMENTS REFLECT ABERRATION WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO HARMONIZE SB THIRTY SIX WOULD PRE TRIAL PILOT PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED BY THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. MEMBERS THE REALITY IS A CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO THE WAY WE HANDLE THE ACCUSED BEFORE TRIAL WE'RE FAILING.

HAVE CAUSE GRAVE DAMAGE TO ABOVE GROUND ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BUT SOME OF THE MOST DEVASTATING FIRES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN IGNITED BY THE- ABOVE GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE AS IN THE CASE OF THE CAMP FIRE. SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE WOULD ASK ELECTRICAL UTILITIES TO HARDEN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO LIVE WITH THE REALITY OF WILDFIRES AND REDUCE THE RISK OF FUTURE CATASTROPHIC FIRES. UNDER GROUNDING IS NOT JUST AN INVESTMENT IN RELIABLE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT AN INVESTMENT IN LIVES AND AVOIDED COSTS TO RATEPAYERS.

GREGORY SENATE BILL SIX SIXTEEN BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY CIVIL ACTIONS. MS RIVAS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH WILL PROTECT THE MINIMAL BALANCE IN A PERSON'S BANK ACCOUNT WHEN IT IS LEVY BY DEBT COLLECTORS UNDER CURRENT LAW EVERY DOLLAR OF A PERSON'S BANK ACCOUNT INCLUDING THEIR LAST PAYCHECK YEAH I. T. C. PAYMENT OR FEMA DISASTER PAYMENT CAN BE WIPED OUT WITH A SINGLE DEBT COLLECTOR LEVY. SB SIX ONE SIX WOULD PROTECT THE LAST SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN A PERSON'S BANK ACCOUNT FROM BEING SEIZED BY DEBT COLLECTORS. WE KNOW THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE LIVING ON THE EDGE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK WITH BARELY ENOUGH TO COVER THEIR NEEDS WE ALL HAVE THESE CONSTITUENTS IN OUR DISTRICTS. FOR EXAMPLE I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT IS MAJORITY LATINO WHERE STUDIES SHOW THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT COLLECTION PROCESS. SOME IMPORTANT PIECES I'M TO NOTE ABOUT SB SIX ONE SIX IT DOES NOT A RACE THAT. IT DOES NOT PROTECT ANYTHING MORE THAN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS DOLLARS REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY BANK ACCOUNTS SOMEONE HAS. IT ESTABLISHES A FLOOR EQUAL TO THE MINIMUM BASIC STANDARD OF ADEQUATE CARE WHICH HAS BEEN CALCULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. TO DETERMINE WHAT A LOW INCOME FAMILY NEEDS TO SURVIVE. IT PROTECTS YOUR CONSTITUENTS FEMA DISASTER FUNDS. AND IT DOES NOT PREVENT DEBT COLLECTORS FROM LIVING ANYTHING ABOVE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ACROSS BANK ACCOUNTS GARNISHING THE WAGES OF WORKERS LIVING PROPERTY OR SEIZING PROPERTY. FLOOR AMENDMENTS TAKEN LAST WEEK REINFORCED THAT SB SIX ONE SIX PROTECTIONS CANNOT BE STACKED ON TOP OF OTHER PROTECTIONS. THIS BILL ENJOYS THE SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE SUPPORT OF DOZENS OF LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS LABOR AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE IN POVERTY AND NOT GOING TODAY SB SIX ONE SIX DOES NOT ERASE ANY DEBT IT'S SIMPLY ALLOWS PEOPLE TO PAY TWO DAYS BILLS WHILE THEY WORK THEIR WAY OUT OF YESTERDAY'S DAT. COLLEAGUES IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT TO END POVERTY IN OUR STATE. WE WILL PASS THIS BILL TODAY I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THERE WAS RIVAS MISS WICKS YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX ONE SIX. THIS BILL ADD SOME BASELINE SECURITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO WOULD LIKE TO USE THE BANK ACCOUNT BUT HAVE FALLEN BEHIND ON AN OLD DEBT.

THE DISPARATE TREATMENT CAUSES CONFUSION AND MAKES UNCLEAR IF AND WHEN SELLERS ARE REQUIRED TO AND SHOULD OBTAIN A LICENSE TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSINESS OF TRANSACTING FIREARMS.

CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST STATE TO INSTITUTE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THESE CONNECTICUT REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL SELLING MORE THAN TEN HANDGUNS TO GET A LICENSE.

AB FIFTY NO FIVE ONE SURE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE AUTHORIZED IN OVERSEEN BY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THAT BEST UNDERSTAND EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL STUDENTS. AND WILL CREATE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IN A STRONGER EMPHASIS. ON EMPOWERING LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND COUNTY BOARDS. FISCAL IMPACT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. FOR ANY BOARD AT TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER IS ALLOWABLE. UNDER THIS BILL. AND THIS MEASURE WILL HELP US MAKE NECESSARY IN TIMELY REFORMS TO CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZATION APPEALS ARE MINERALS AS WE MOVE FORWARD AGAIN THANKS TO ALL. FOR THEIR INPUT FOR THE DISCUSSION FOR THE DIAL DIALOGUE AND FOR THIS FINAL PRODUCT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BONTA MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT THE ENEMY UNLESS YOU ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO. AND WHAT IS THE STATUS QUO IN A WORD AND THE WORD FAILURE DESPITE LARGE FUNDING INCREASES OUR SCHOOLS ARE OVERCROWDED TEACHERS ARE UNDERPAID AND STUDENTS AREN'T GETTING THE QUALITY EDUCATION THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. IN MANY LOW INCOME AREAS AND RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE SITUATION IS EVEN WORSE CHARTERS OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE ESPECIALLY IN UNDERSERVED AREAS MY SON WENT TO A CHARTER SCHOOL AND WHEN THE PARENTS WHEN HE WAS ON A LOTTERY FOR THREE DIFFERENT TIMES BECAUSE THERE WERE. A THOUSAND FAMILIES IN LINE TO TRY TO GET INTO THAT SCHOOL AND THAT MEANS IT'S OFTEN ALTERNATIVE FOR PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE TO GET THEIR KIDS THE QUALITY EDUCATION WHICH IS A STEP OUT AND CHANCE. AND THEY ALL OF THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS OFFER STUDENTS A CHANCE TO ESCAPE FAILING SCHOOLS AND LEARN IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT SUITS THEIR NEEDS THEY OFFER ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF THE SCHOOLS AND PERFORMING PARENTS CAN MOVE THEIR CHILDREN TO ONE THAT IS. WITH THIS BILL SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE TRYING TO TAKE THAT AWAY I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH ALL THOSE WHO RAISE THE CONCERNS OF. MAKING SURE THAT HIGH PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOLS WERE NOT GOING TO BE SET DOWN UNDER. A NEW PROCESS AS A LONG TIME SUPPORTER OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS I WELCOME THIS BILL. AND I THINK THE OFF ROLE AS HARD WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU MISTER MAYOR SU CHI'S SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER O'DONNELL YOU MAY CLOSE. THAT'S WHEN I VOTE ON CONCURRENCE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTED IS THERE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTED IS THERE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTED ESERVER. CLERK WILL CLOSE THE ROLE IN TALLY THE VOTE EYES FIFTY SIX NO SIXTEEN SENATE AMENDMENTS ARE CONCURRED IN. MOVING TO FILE ITEM ONE SIXTY TWO SB THREE TWENTY NINE THE CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY NINE BY SENATOR MITCHELL WHEN I RELATING TO DISCRIMINATION. MR GLORIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY NINE A LONG OVERDUE ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE TO PROTECT SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ACCORDING TO A NATIONAL REPORT RELEASED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT FOR EVERY THIRTY NINE RENTAL ADVERTISEMENTS THAT A FAMILY WITH A HOUSING ASSISTED VOUCHER COULD AFFORD THERE WAS ONLY ONE AD THEY DID NOT EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT VOUCHER HOLDERS FROM EVEN APPLYING FOR THE UNIT. THAT SAME REPORT FOUND THAT IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS DID NOT EXIST DENIAL RATES OF ASSISTED INCOME FAMILIES WERE AS HIGH AS 75% OR MORE IN PLACES WHERE THESE INCOME PROTECTIONS EXISTED BUT THE NOW RATE DECLINED DRAMATICALLY THIS BILL IS ABOUT GIVING THOSE INCOME ASSISTANT FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA A FIGHTING SO IT'S IN OUR DIFFICULT HOUSING ECONOMY. I HOPE THE EACH OF YOU WOULD CONSIDER WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IF YOU SAW TODAY IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY NINETEEN AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR RENTAL UNIT THAT SAID NO PEOPLE OF COLOR MAY APPLY. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF YOU SAW AN AD THAT SAID NO VETERAN MAY APPLY. BECAUSE IF ANY OF YOU ANY OF YOU ARE ANY SIDE OF THE AISLE SAW SUCH AN AD YOU WOULD CONTEND THAT FOR THE DISCRIMINATION THAT IT IS AND IMMEDIATELY DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN IN THIS BODY TO STOP IT. WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW THAT KIND OF DISCRIMINATION IN CALIFORNIA AND WE SHOULD ALLOW THIS KIND OF DISCRIMINATION IN CALIFORNIA AND YET IT HAPPENS IT HAPPENS REGULARLY WHAT ADDS ACROSS THE STATE WE ARE BLAZING WITH THE WORDS NO SECTION EIGHT. MAY APPLY. MEMBERS MONEY IS MONEY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IT COMES FROM YOU CAN STILL CASH THE CHECK AT THE FIRST OF THE MONTH. AND IT SHOULD NOT MATTER IF THE RENT CONTINUES TO BE SET BY A PROPERTY OWNER NO ONE IN THIS BILL IS BEING ASKED TO TAKE A HAIR CUT OR TO GET A LITTLE BIT LESS ALL WERE SIMPLY ASKING THEM TO DO IS TO GIVE EVERY CALIFONE BORN IN. A FAIR SHOT AT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AT A PRICE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. DISCRIMINATED AGAINST SOMEONE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS THAT IS MEANT TO KEEP PEOPLE SHELTERED IS NOT ONLY UNCONSCIONABLE BUT IT'S ILLOGICAL IN A STATE WITH THE AMOUNT OF HOMELESS THAT WE HAVE. YOU DO NOT GET TO TELL US THAT WE ARE TOO POOR TO EVEN APPLY FOR AN APARTMENT THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD AND THEN TELL THE AUTHORITIES AROUND US UP ON PARK BENCHES TURNED INTO BED OR IN PARKED CARS TURN INTO HOMES. THAT ARE TOO MUCH OF AN EYESORE YOU SEE THE LOGIC THAT IS NOT PRESENT IN THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS BILL WHICH IS WHY YOU MUST VOTE FOR IT. CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE ALREADY ENACTED THESE SAME KINDS OF PROTECTIONS DO A ORDINANCES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY CITIES LIKE DARK REALLY LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCOSANTA MONICA AND YOU CAN IN MY HOMETOWN OF SAN DIEGO. SO LET'S GUARANTEED. THAT'S GUARANTEED TO SAFEGUARD FROM DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. ALL CALIFORNIANS LET'S VOTE FOR SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA MISTER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I ALSO RISE AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THREE TWENTY NINE. HOUSING VOUCHERS ARE FOR THOSE ON THE VERGE OF HOMELESSNESS AND CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. OR BEING ON THE STREETS. CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU MIGHT HEAR THE MAJORITY OF VOUCHER HOLDERS ARE SENIOR CITIZENS SINGLE PARENT FAMILIES. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. NOT CRIMINALS. MY CITIES AND MANY OTHER CITIES USE HOUSING VOUCHERS TO HELP FIGHT HOMELESSNESS. AND IT IS IN STE INEXCUSABLE. THAT LANDLORDS WOULD DISCRIMINATE. AND WON'T EVEN CONSIDER A PROSPECTIVE TENANT IF THEY WILL BE PAYING RENT WITH THE VOUCHER. IN MY DISTRICT THE PROB PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN SO BAD THAT MANY TENANTS WHO HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN AWARDED A VOUCHER. CAN'T FIND HOUSING THAT WILL ACCEPT IT. I LITERALLY HAVE HOMELESS PEOPLE WITH VOUCHERSTELLING MY DISTRICT OFFICE THAT THEY ARE USELESS BECAUSE THE MINUTE THEY TELL LANDLORD THEIR SECTION EIGHT. THEIR TURN DOWN THAT'S JUST WRONG. ACCORDING TO THE LOS ANGELES TIMES 76% OF LANDLORDS CONTACTED BY THEN REFUSED TO ACCEPT VOUCHERS THEY JUST FLAT OUT REFUSE. IN A FLUID COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTY SUCH AS MY DISTRICT 82% OF THE LANDLORDS WOULDN'T TAKE VOUCHERS. DENIAL RATES WERE FAR LOWER IN CITIES THAT PROHIBITED A PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION AGAINST VOUCHER HOLDERS. THIS BILL DOES NOT FORCE LANDLORDS TO RENT TO ANY GIVEN TENANT BUT SIMPLY REQUIRES THEM TO GIVE EVERY TENANT THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY'LL BE PAYING THE RENT. IT'S STILL ALLOWS FOR CREDIT CHECKS RENTAL HISTORY AND OTHER REFERENCE CHECKS. MEMBERS LET ME REMIND YOU EARLY THIS SPRING CITIES ACROSS THE STATE DID THEIR HOMELESS COUNTS AND WHAT EVERY CITY FOUND WAS THAT THE RISE IN HOMELESSNESS WAS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISE IN RENTS AND THE LACK OF AFFORDABILITY. AROUND THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE I ON THIS MEASURE WHICH WILL LET TENANTS KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS SERIOUS ABOUT TO HAVE IT PROTECTIONS. AND KEEPING PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AS WE WORK TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU ASKED. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS WHAT'S LOST IN THE SENSATIONALISM THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS IS IT SECTION EIGHT IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. NO LANDLORD HAS TO PARTICIPATE. IN SECTION EIGHT. ONLY IF THEY DECIDE THAT THEY WANT. TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT DO THEY HAVE TO THAT'S FEDERAL LAW. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS IT SAYS IF SOMEONE DECIDES NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM. LET'S SAY THEY HAVE ALL RENTERS BEING EQUAL SEVERAL RENTER APPLICANTS. SEVERAL OF THEM WHO ARE NOT SECTION EIGHT AND SOMEONE WHO IS AND THEY DECIDE NO I DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT I'M GOING TO RENT. TO THE NON SECTION EIGHT TENANTS. THEY ARE NOW OPEN UP TO LAWSUITS AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. IT'S ANOTHER CONSUMER ATTORNEY LAWSUIT MIL TO GO AFTER LANDLORDS TO SAY YOU'RE ONLY REJECTING THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE SECTION EIGHT NOW. PEOPLE CAN REJECT SECTION EIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THAT. IS FEDERAL LAW AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO SO. WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE THIS PROVISION IN THERE WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE THIS PROVISION IN LAW. IN ALL THE ONLY THING THE ONLY THING THAT IS DOING WE HAD THIS BILL AND JUDICIARY BECAME VERY CLEAR THE ONLY THING THIS DO IS SETTING UP. LANDLORDS FOR FURTHER LAWSUITS AND WHAT WILL THAT DO. IT WILL CAUSE LANDLORDS TO RENT TO LESS PEOPLE IT WILL CAUSE PEOPLE TO LESS PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED IN IN THE RENTAL MARKET. FOR HOUSING. AND THEREBY AGAIN DECREASED SUPPLY. AND WHAT IS DECREASING SUPPLY DO THAT'S RIGHT IT RAISES RENTS. SO ALL THIS LIKE FEEL GOOD THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE GONNA HAVE ANOTHER MEASURE BEFORE US HERE SOON. IS FEEL GOOD MEASURES THAT ACTUALLY IT LEAD TO PEOPLE GETTING HIGHER RENTS. TO HOUSING BECOMING LESS AFFORDABLE. AND SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT. AGAIN WE DON'T NEED THIS MEASURE INTO LAW IT WILL IT WILL SUBJECT PEOPLE TO. FURTHER LAWSUITS. AND AGAIN SECTION EIGHT IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM NO ONE HAS TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM ASK FOR YOUR KNOW THE- THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER AND MR STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER LET ME DISPEL THAT MYTH THAT IS NOT TRUE THAT THIS REQUIRES ANYONE TO ENTER INTO THE SECTION EIGHT WE HAD THIS DEBATE PRETTY VIGOROUSLY IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT THAT FAIRLY DIRECTLY VERY DIRECTLY BY THE OPPOSITION WHO KEPT RAISING THAT METHOD THIS WOULD REQUIRE SECTION A PARTICIPATION THEY REALLY COULDN'T EVEN BEGIN TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT DOES NOT REQUIRE PARTICIPATION IN SECTION EIGHT WHAT IT DOES SAY. IS YOU MAY NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE SOURCE OF INCOME. BECAUSE THAT. THE NILE OF SECTION EIGHT SECTION EIGHT NEED NOT APPLY IS IT A LOT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS CODE FOR IF YOU'RE BLACK IN YOUR BROWN DON'T APPLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND HOUSING HERE. THIS IS A DISCRIMINATION ISSUE DISCRIMINATION ON THE SOURCE OF INCOME IT SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER STONE MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. ONE RESPOND MIKE MY COLLEAGUES COMMENT TO. YOU KNOW. WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE BILL AYE. AYE MY INITIAL REACTION WAS. A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF AN EFFORT TO TELL LANDLORDS. WHO TO RANT AND WHO THEY SHOULD BE LEADING TO. BUT THEN WHEN I. NO. REALIZED THAT THIS PERHAPS IS NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM. CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST WHERE YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE WOULD SAY IF YOU RENT TO THOSE PEOPLE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO LOWER YOUR PROPERTY VALUE OR IF YOU READ TO THOSE PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO AND FIGHT CRIME. YOU KNOW I. THIS BILL AS THE CHAIR OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE INDICATED AND I WANTED TO CONFIRM. YOU KNOW WE STILL DOESN'T PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF A BAD CREDIT HISTORY. IT DOESN'T PREVENT PEOPLE TO DISCRIMINATE ON THE ON THE BASIS OF. A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND AND WHAT WHAT WHAT THIS DOES FOR OF A PREVENT AND WHAT IT'S TRYING TO DO IS TO. IS TO AT LEAST. YOU KNOW GET THAT FACE TO FACE MEETING BETWEEN US AS A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER HOLDER AND A AND A LANDLORD YOU KNOW IF THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN PAY THEIR BILLS AND THAT THEY WON'T CAUSE PROBLEMS AND THEY THE THEY BE A GOOD TENANT. THEN WE NEED TO WE NEED TO HELP THESE THESE PEOPLE OUT I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE YOU KNOW I STILL HAVE SOME RELUCTANCE YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE A LOT OF LANDLORDS MY DISTRICT THAT ARE. GONNA BE UNHAPPY WITH BY VOTERS SUPPORTED THIS BUT- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND. ONE OF THE GREAT PRIVILEGES OF SERVICES THESE DEBATES CAUSE US TO REFLECT UPON OURSELVES AND WHO WE ARE AND WHO ARE VALUES ARE. AND ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL I FEEL IMPELLED TO RECITE JOHN DONE. PERMISSION TO READ WITHOUT OBJECTION. NO MAN IS AN ISLAND ENTIRE OF ITSELF. EVERY MAN IS A PIECE THE CONTINENT A PART OF THE MAIN. IF A CLOUD BE WASHED AWAY BY THE SEA EUROPE IS THE LESS AS WELL AS OF A PROMONTORY WERE. AS WELL AS ANY MANAGED BY FRIENDS OF THINE OWN WERE. ANY MAN'S DEATH DIMINISHES ME BECAUSE I AM INVOLVED IN MANKIND. AND THEREFORE NEVER SEND TO KNOW FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS IT TOLLS FOR THEE. I SEE A BILL LIKE THIS IS CONFRONTING US WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. NEIGHBORS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE AT RISK. THEY MAY BE AT RISK IN WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT AT RISK. AND IT REALLY CAN SUFFER THE NEED WHATEVER OUR CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE LAWMAKERS RATHER'S. TO HAVE THE HUMILITY. TO CONSERVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THOSE AROUND US. AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT IN THIS SECTION APPLIES OUR RATES ARE RELATED TO OUR NATION'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE. WHERE THERE IS NO HUMILITY. THERE IS NO HUMANITY I THINK THIS IS A FINAL VOTE I THANK MY COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE FROM LOS ANGELES ORIGINAL VOTE THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE TWO NINE. YOU KNOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED OBVIOUSLY ON THIS FLOOR WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF ISSUES CONCERNING HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND WE CONTINUE TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU DRESS SUCH AN ISSUE LIKE THAT. THERE ARE SO MANY WHO HAVE CONFLICTS PERSONAL CONFLICTS WHETHER THEY'RE HOMEOWNERS WITH A THERE ARE WHERE THEY OWN HOMES THAT THEY THE LANDLORDS IN THE RENTERS AND THESE THINGS ARE CRITICAL ISSUES AND YET WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE HOMELESS PROBLEM IS IF SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO SOLVE IT FOR US. SOMEHOW ANOTHER MAGICALLY THIS IS GOING TO RESOLVE ITSELF AS WE CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH OF ALL THE PRACTICES THAT WE'VE DONE THAT BASICALLY KEEP THIS SITUATION GROWING AND GROWING IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE'S NO NEIGHBORHOOD I KNOW OF IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THAT IS NOT AFFECTED BY HOMELESSNESS THE MOST RESIDENTIAL AREAS YOU LOOK AND SOMEONE IS UNDER A BRIDGE UNDER SOME BUSHES OR TREE OR SOMEWHERE. AND THIS IS REALLY OUR PROBLEM AND THE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SOLVE IT AND THIS IS A SMALL STEP IN DOING THAT. IT REMINDS ME AS I. WHEN I WAS IN AUSTRALIA BUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. AND WE WERE CONFRONTED WE WOULD TIME SYDNEY. AND SOMEONE ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR HOMELESS PROBLEM. WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS AND IT WOULDN'T SEE THESE WE DIDN'T SEE THESE THINGS OCCURRING AND SO WE SAID WHAT WHAT DID YOU DO WHAT ROB WHAT WE LOOK FOR THE MAGIC THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO FIND SOME. MAJOR LEGISLATION THAT WAS GOING TO BE SO UNIQUE. AND THIS WOMAN SAID TO ME VERY HONESTLY SHE SAID WE DECIDED. THAT HOMELESSNESS WAS AN AFFRONT TO OUR HUMANITY. HE SAID EVERY TIME WE SAW SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE BASICS LIKE A PLACE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT THAT WAS SECURE SHE SAID I FELT LESS. THAN A HUMAN BEING. AND I FEEL THE SAME WAY. AND MOST OF YOU DO TOO WE DRIVE DOWN THE STREET WAS SOMETIMES EVEN AFRAID TO LET PEOPLE AYE AYE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY THAT THEY ARE HURTING AND THE AND WITH THAT WE PROBABLY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR COMFORT ZONE THAT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING. THIS IS NOT A MAJOR MAJOR ISSUE BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO RENT A PLACE. HAVE AT LEAST THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE TO THE LANDLORD THEN I AM A PERSON WORTHY. WORTHY BECAUSE I'M A HUMAN BEING. OF HAVING A PLACE TO STAY. AND I'LL BE A GOOD TENANT. AND SO I OFTEN THINK ABOUT THAT EVERY TIME SOMETHING COMES UP WHEN I SEE SOMEONE I JUST FEEL LIKE. THAT I AM LESS OF A HUMAN BEING. THE MY HER MANATEES BEING CHIPPED AWAY. MY HEART HAS BEEN HARDENED. AND I DON'T LIKE THAT. AND SO I ASK YOU TODAY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL SB THREE TWO NINE SMALL MINOR BILL IN MANY WAYS BUT YET IS THE EFFORT TO REALLY RESTORE OUR HUMANITY. AND TO REALIZE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS OUR PROBLEM IT WOULD NOT SOLVE ITSELF. AND SOME OF US WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE SOLVING OF IT BUT I THINK IN THE PROCESS OF THE US DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. WE RESTORE OUR HUMANITY AS A STATE AND WE WILL ALL FEEL BETTER AND SLEEP SOUNDER AT NIGHT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I WILL THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MISS COME LONGER DRIVE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I. HADN'T PLANNED ON IT BUT I TO WANT TO RISE AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE TWO NINE. I TO WILL WILL PROBABLY SUFFER SOME HEARTACHE IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS. WHO ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. BUT THIS BILL REALLY JUST. ASKS LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY OWNERS TO INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ACCESS IT DOES NOT SAY YOU MUST RENT TO FOLKS WHO ARE ON SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS. BUT IT DOES SAY YOU MUST GIVE THEM EQUAL ACCESS TO HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY IN TO BE VETTED. IT IS AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION BILL. AND WE TALK IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS ON SO MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE EQUITY INTO THE POLICIES THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING AND THIS BILL IS ABOUT GREATER EQUITY. I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE SHARED THE STORY BEFORE BUT I AM THE PRODUCT OF A BIRACIAL MARRIAGE MY DAD IS WHITE AND MY MOTHER IS BLACK. AND IN CHICAGO IN THE VERY EARLY SEVENTIES THEY WERE LOOKING TO RENT AN APARTMENT AND MY MOTHER HADTO WORK SO MY DAD WENT OUT LOOK FOR AN APARTMENT. AND HE FOUND A NICE PLACE YOU APPLY. AND THE LANDLORD SHOWED HIM AROUND AND AT THE END HE SAID WHERE'S YOUR WIFE. AND HE SAID WELL SHE'S WORKING. AND EARLIER HE HAD DISCUSSED WANTING TO RENT TO MY DAD. AND AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS NOT THERE. THE LANDLORD TOOK A PAUSE. IN SAID. I'M GOING TO FILE THE APPLICATION AWAY. MY DAD WENT HOME SHARED THIS WITH MY MOTHER. THEY CALL TWO FRIENDS OF THEIRS WHO WERE NOT MARRIED BUT WERE BOTH WHITE AND THEY SAID PRETEND TO GO AND LOOK AT THIS APARTMENT. AND SO THEY DID. AND THE LANDLORD SET SO GREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH HERE I HAVE AN APARTMENT READY FOR YOU. NO ONE ELSE HAS LOOKED FOR IT AND WENT TO THEM. AND MY FOLKS ACTUALLY HAD TO FILE AN APPEAL. WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IN CHICAGO. BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS BLACK. JUST FORTY PLUS YEARS AGO. THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THAT EXPERIENCE NOW MY FOLKS GOT THAT APARTMENT. BECAUSE. THEY WERE VIABLE APPLICANTS. IT WASN'T SOME SORT OF RETRIBUTION FOR RACISM AND THEY TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY GOOD TENANTS. IN FACT THE LANDLORD TOLD THEM THAT A YEAR LATER HE SAID I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT YOU ALL WOULD BE SO GOOD. BUT IN FACT. YOU TURNED OUT TO BE OKAY. THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THAT EXPERIENCE. AND SO WHILE IT MAY BE TOUGH FOR SOME OF YOU I AM URGING AN AYE VOTE ON SB THREE TWO NINE BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE YOU NEED A LITTLE ECONOMIC SUPPORT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE A BAD TENANT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO TRASH THE PLACE DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO BRING DOWN THE PROPERTY VALUES. IT JUST MEANS YOU NEED A LITTLE ASSISTANCE AND I BET EVERYONE IN THESE CHAMBERS HAS NEEDED A LITTLE ASSISTANCE I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. THANK YOU MUST COME LONGER DOES MISS QUIRK SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I STAND HERE ALSO TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AGAIN WE'VE NOTED ABOUT HOUSING THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR OF NOT ONLY THE RISE IN HOMELESSNESS FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN DIEGO AND ALL THE WAY UP NORTH BUT WE KNOW THAT. NOT ONLY FIXING HOMELESSNESS IS GOING TO REQUIRE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS AND MANY MANY OPTIONS IN THIS IS JUST ONE. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT WHAT IS BEING DESCRIBED IN THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY FAKE NEWS AND THE FAKE NEWS IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO A DEMAND OR MANDATE THAT LANDLORDS TAKE THESE APPLICANTS WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IS IT GIVES THEM A FAIR SHOT. AND AS WAS NOTED BEFORE. WE DON'T HAVE APPLICATIONS THAT SAY I WILL NOT ACCEPT A CHRISTIAN FAMILY I WILL NOT ACCEPT A JEWISH FAMILY I WILL NOT ACCEPT A LATINO FAMILY AND FOR US TO SAY WE WILL NOT ACCEPT TO SECTION EIGHT. AB CAN'T IS DISCRIMINATION AND ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN US IS THESE VOUCHERS AND WHEN SOMEBODY FINALLY GETS A VOUCHER AND FOR SOME IT'S MANY NOT ONLY MONTHS BUT COULD BE YEARS. AND THEN THEY CAN'T USE IT WERE ACTUALLY SAYING TO THEM THAT THAT TOOL YOU HAVE OR THAT VOUCHER. IS NOT GOING TO BE GRANTED AND WE HAVE NO PLACE FOR IT HERE AND THAT IS THE STORY THAT'S REPEATED OVER AND OVER WHEN THEY CALL OR WHEN THEYLOOK ON AN ONLINE APPLICATION IT JUST SAYS DOES DO NOT ACCEPT SECTION EIGHT. AND WHAT WE ARE SAYING BY SUPPORTING THIS BILL IS EVERYONE HAS VALUE LOOK AT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND MAKE THE CHOICE SO I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS QUIRK SILVA SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER COREY YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I WANT TO THANK MY CLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT A BILL THAT I THINK IS TRULY IMPORTANT ON AND I WANT TO THANK SENATOR MITCHELL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOCKEY THIS PARTICULAR BILL. MY FIRST POSITION IN POLITICS WAS AS A CITY HOUSING COMMISSIONER AND SAN DIEGO. AND ANY DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF OVERSEEING A SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE ON THE WAITING LIST FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND SAN DIEGO IT'S MORE THAN A DECADE. IMAGINE WHAT IT IS TO BE A SINGLE MOM TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET FOR ALL THOSE YEARS WAITING FOR THE CALL FROM THE HOUSING COMMISSION SAY YOU GOT A VOUCHER. YOU THINK ABOUT THE HOMELESS PERSON LIVING IN A SHELL A SHELTER SOMEWHERE HOPING TO BE CALLED AND SAID THAT YOU CAN GET A PERMANENT HOME. AND YOU CAN THINK IN EITHER THOSE INSTANCES WHEN THEY FINALLY GET THAT CALL TO GO OUT AND NOT FIND A SINGLE PERSON WHO RENTED AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THAT WILL DO. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY ARE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IS GETTING WORSE WHY MORE FAMILIES ARE GETTING PUSHED OUT OF THEIR HOMES YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE DESIGNED TO HELP THE VERY PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT. SO OFTEN IN THIS CHAMBER ARE NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF LANDLORDS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE THEM A FAIR SHOT. AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN I'M GONNA REPEAT AT THIS VERY SAME MOMENT THIS DOES NOT DEMAND A LANDLORD RENT TO SOMEONE WITH SECTION EIGHT. IT SIMPLY SAYS THEY CANNOT SAY THAT THEY MAY NOT APPLY WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE SECTION EIGHT AND ANY OF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS CONCEPT OR HAVING DIFFICULTY NAVIGATING IT BECAUSE QUITE HONESTLY THIS NOT UNANIMOUS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHO'S ON THIS FLOOR. I'M A TELL YOU THIS WE HAVE LONG IN THIS STATE HAD RULES THAT SAY THAT YOU MAY NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEONE WITH A DISABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING. BUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THIS FLOOR UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO OBLIGATION TO RENT TO SOMEONE WHO IS DISABLED YOU SIMPLY MAY NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THEM. THIS IS THE SAME FOR STORIES OF INCOME IN THIS REGARD. MEMBERS I'M ASKING YOU TO HELP. MANY CRITICIZED THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH ON HOUSING. IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING. HOUSING WITH THE- BILLION. TO THIS DATE TO HELP. COME PEOPLE GET BY. THE QUESTION FOR A LOT OF US IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR POOR PEOPLE FOR WORKING PEOPLE FROM MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE. LET'S ANSWER THAT QUESTION TODAY WITH YOUR AFFIRMATIVE VOTE ON THE SB THREE TWENTY NINE. LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR. THAT MONEY IS MONEY THE CHECK WILL GET CASH YOU WILL GET PAID. BUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO. IS MAKE SURE THAT YOU LISTEN TO EVERYONE AND YOU GIVE EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT. THAT IS WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT YOUR VOTE SHOULD BE ABOUT.

SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE CLICK READ SENATE BILL FOUR TWENTY FIVE BY SENATOR HILL AN ACCOLADE HEALING ARTS. MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE WHICH REQUIRES HOSPITALS CLINICS AND OTHER HEALTH FACILITIES TO REPORT ALLEGATIONS OF PATIENTS SEXUAL ABUSE AND OTHER SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO THE APPROPRIATE STATE LICENSING AUTHORITIES WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. AS WE'VE SEEN HAS BECOME ALL TOO CLEAR. MANY OF. THE SEXUAL ABUSE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT HAS COOLEY COME TO LIGHT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WAS COVERED UP. THESE ISSUES WERE NOT WRITTEN PROPERLY REPORTED THEY WERE COVERED UP BY THE BY THE VERY INSTITUTIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. HELPING PROTECT PEOPLE. SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE CLOSES LEGAL LOOPHOLES THAT CAN ALLOW THE SUBJECT OF REPEATED SEXUAL ABUSE AND MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS. AT TO WORK AT A HEALTH CARE FACILITY FOR YEARS BECAUSE THE RELEVANT REGULATORY BOARD IS NOT NOTIFIED BY THE FACILITY OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST A LICENSEE. ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT BY DOCTORS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS MUST BE REPORTED SWIFTLY TO THE APPROPRIATE LICENSING BOARD FOR REVIEW SO THAT REGULATORS. CAN DETERMINE WHETHER TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION. BECAUSE AN ALLEGATION IS REPORTED IN NO WAY MEANS THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD WATER MEDICALLY BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION ALL ALL COMPLAINTS SENT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND FIRST REVIEWED BY A DOCTOR. ON STAFF TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER EDGE ACTION IS WARRANTED. THIS IS A MUCH NEEDED STEP. AS YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE U. S. C. AND DOCTOR TYNDALL SCANDAL. WHERE THERE WERE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT FOR DECADES. NONE OF THE PRIOR COMPLAINTS WERE EVER REPORTED. TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. THIS IS WHY THE MANDATORY REPORTING WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE MEDICAL BOARD IS SO ESSENTIAL. WE CAN NO LONGER JUST SAY LEAVE THESE TO HEALTH CLINICS AND HOSPITALS A DO IT ON THEIR OWN. AND WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO MORE. WE'RE CLOSING ONE LOOPHOLE HERE TODAY BUT ONE THAT REMAINS TO BE DONE IN FUTURE WORK. IS THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS WE KNOW THAT. FOR EXIT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE U. S. GYMNASTICS SCANDAL IT WAS MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY A GOVERNMENT. SPONSORED UNIVERSITY THAT CONTINUE TO COVER UP YEARS OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND MISCONDUCT. NONE OF OUR BILLS SO FAR HAVE APPLIED THESE RULES. TO STATE GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S THE NEXT STEP THAT SHOULD BE A BIG PRIORITY FOR OUR NEXT SESSION MEMBERS. SO IF TODAY I ASK THAT YOU HELP CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE WHICH IS SO ESSENTIAL. BIAS BY PASSING SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU. SAYING NO DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ADAM CAR CLUB IN MORE.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I RISE TO PRESENT THE ANNUAL BAR DUES BILL. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE BEEN HERE FOR A FEW YEARS YOU REALIZE THAT IT IS THIS HOUSE WHO HAS DRIVEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AT THE STATE BAR. MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO US AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE BEING THEIR OBLIGATION OF PULP THE PUBLIC PROTECTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE SET FOR THEM A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. THIS YEAR'S UNIQUE HOWEVER BECAUSE THE STATE BAR CAME TO US ASKING FOR AN INCREASE IN THE DUES. DEUCE WIRES PAY HAS NOT BEEN RAISED IN TWENTY YEARS. A POTENTIALLY MORE. AND MASSES FOR A LARGE CHUNK OF MONEY JUSTIFIED BY SOME. STATEMENTS AND SOME DOCUMENTATION THAT SEEMED INADEQUATE FORTUNATELY THIS HOUSE REQUIRED AN AUDIT BY THE LA L. AN AUDIT BY THE STATE AUDITOR. THE INFORMATION THAT WE OBTAINED THROUGH THOSE AUDIT SHOWED THAT WHAT THE STATE BAR WAS ASKING FOR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THEY COULD JUSTIFY. SO WHILE THIS BILL DOES INCLUDE. AN INCREASE IN THE IN THE ANNUAL DUES. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL IS NOW MUCH MORE REASONABLE AND- THIS BILL CONTAINS PROVISIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE THAT THE STATE BAR IS SPENDING THE MONEY IN WAYS THAT THE STATE AUDITOR AND THE LA. SUGGESTED AND AGAIN DAD IS THE OVERSIGHT THAT WE'RE PROVIDING OVERDID MINISTRY TO FUNCTION OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. I FEEL THAT THIS THIS BILL IS REASONABLE I KNOW THAT WOULD THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING QUITE A BIT FROM ATTORNEYS WHO ARE OBJECTING TO PAYING TO HIGHER FEES. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN RAISED IN A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE FACT THAT THAT THIS NUMBER THAT IS NOW IN THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY BOTH THE LA AND THE STATE AUDITOR. I THINK IT IS A REASONABLE STEP BUT THAT SHOULD NOT AT ALL TAKE AWAY FROM THE OVERSIGHT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO OVER THE STATE BAR.
