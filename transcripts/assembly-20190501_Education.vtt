IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:44.982
BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE AND

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:47.618

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:05.236
ENGAGING.

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:07.138
WHEN I TAUGHT A P. BIOLOGY WE

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:09.673
USED DISSECTION AS PART OF OUR

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.375
LESSON PLAN?

00:40:11.442 --> 00:40:14.512
AND DISSECTED RATS.

00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:16.380
DURING THIS CLASS IT WAS

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:17.848
DIFFICULT.

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.350
OR IT WAS CLEAR THAT A

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:21.685
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:22.620
WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND HAD

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:24.054
DIFFICULTY CONDUCTING THE

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:26.223
DISSECTION.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.925
THEY FOUND THE FORMALDEHYDE.

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:30.528
DIFFICULT TO STOMACH.

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:31.862
AND HAD STRONG VISCERAL

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:33.831
REACTIONS TO THE CUTTING AND

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:36.500
DISMEMBERING OF THE RATS.

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:37.835
WHICH AFFECTED THEIR ABILITY TO

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.603
FOCUS AND EFFECTIVELY COMPREHEND

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.305
THE COURSE WORK.

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:43.574
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE PRECAUTIONARY

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:45.976
STEPS THAT I TOOK TO LIMIT THE

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:48.212
EXPOSURE TO FORMALDEHYDE.

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:50.080
ANY EXPOSURE TO THESE AIRBORNE

00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:53.017
TOXINS CAN BE HARMFUL.

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.752
INSTEAD OF USING ACTUAL ANIMAL

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:56.487
SPECIMENS.

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:57.621
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED USING

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:06.130
AND VIRTUAL DISSECTION.

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:08.332
WHICH I BELIEVE ARE FAR SUPERIOR

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:09.767
TO THE OLD ANIMAL DISSECTION

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.669
PROTOCOL.

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:14.071
THERE ARE NO TOXIC CHEMICALS.

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:17.074
NO MESS NO CHANCE OF INJURY.

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.176
NO ODOR.

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:20.344
AND INVOLVES NO TIME FOR CLEAN

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.446

LESSON AT HOME AND REPEAT

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.353

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.055
MISTAKE.

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:32.223
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN OF GREAT

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:35.192
BENEFIT TO THEM.

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:36.093
STUDENTS MAY HAVE A MORBID

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.562
CURIOSITY ABOUT WHAT'S INSIDE AN

LEADS TO KINDER ADULTS WHO TREAT

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:02.920
ALL WITH KINDNESS AND RESPECT.

00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:04.521

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:51.655
A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE SHIFT

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:54.057
IS THAT STUDENTS ARE DRIVING THE

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.191
INSTRUCTION.

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:56.292

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:13.276
CURIOSITY AND WONDER.

REMOVE THE COLLABORATIVE ASPECT

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.550
OF THE SCIENCE CLASSROOM.

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:22.619
STUDENTS CURIOSITY IN WONDER ARE

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:24.888
NOT DRIVING INSTRUCTION INSTEAD

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:26.623
STUDENTS ARE SHOWN ONE PERSON'S

PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IS

00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:29.259
INTERESTING ABOUT A SINGULAR

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:30.460
SPECIMEN.

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:31.928
THE PRACTICE IS THE ANTITHESIS

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:33.730
OF THE NATURE OF SCIENCE THE

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.665
FOUNDATION FOR THE NEXT

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:36.833
GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.068
IN THAT SCIENTISTS OBSERVE

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:41.805
MULTIPLE SPECIMENS FOR VARIATION

00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:42.706
OF TRAITS.

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:43.173
AS A TEACHER IT IS MY

00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:45.108
RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHAT

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:46.676
IS APPROPRIATE FOR MY CLASSROOM.

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:47.944
IN MAKING THESE DECISIONS I

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:51.815
CONSIDER THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL

00:55:51.881 --> 00:55:53.349
I CARE ABOUT MY STUDENTS AND

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:54.918
WANT WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM.

00:55:54.984 --> 00:55:56.519
STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO OPT OUT OF

00:55:56.586 --> 00:55:58.088

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.592
I MAKE THIS WELL KNOWN IN MY

SPECIMENS IN THE CLASSROOM AND

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:19.943

00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:21.211
THIS HAS ACTUALLY RESULTED IN

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:22.512
HEIGHTENED AWARENESS AND

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:24.147
COMPASSION FOR ANIMALS THAT

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:11.561
PRIVATE SCHOOL THEY SECTION IS

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:12.862
ALREADY AN OPTIONAL CLASSROOM

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.697
ACTIVITY IN SOME SCHOOLS I

00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:15.698
SECTION IS A VALUABLE TEACHING

00:57:15.765 --> 00:57:17.333
TOOL AND IT OTHER STUDENTS MAY

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.802
HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY OR A

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:20.170
COMBINATION OF BOTH.

00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:21.538
BUT THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY

00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:24.407
LOCALLY TO DECIDE AGAIN THIS IS

00:57:24.474 --> 00:57:25.275
OPTIONAL AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO

00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:25.909
BE.

00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:27.710
AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX IS COUNTER

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.179
TO LOCAL CONTROL AND WOULD

00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:30.246
REMOVE HANDS ON LEARNING

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:32.182

CHOICES FROM CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.351
THIS BAND IS TOO AGGRESSIVE AND

00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:36.686
SUGGEST THAT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:38.454
LEADERS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS

INTERVENTION WE DON'T BELIEVE

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:44.127
THIS IS THE CASE.

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.428
WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:47.063
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.364
ENGAGE STUDENTS AND FOSTER

CODE IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT OR

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:09.052
NEEDS CLARIFICATION.

00:59:37.173 --> 00:59:39.509
THAT I HAD A GATE MISTER KALRA.

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:40.877
YOU MENTIONED THAT -- WITH THIS

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:42.345
BILL THERE WOULD NOT BE A

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.948
PROHIBITION ON DIE SECTIONS

00:59:45.014 --> 00:59:46.516
YOU'RE YOU'RE ALLUDING THAT.

00:59:46.582 --> 00:59:47.650
THE STUDENTS WOULDN'T BE

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:49.953
DISSECTING BUT THAT THE TEACHERS

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:51.254
WOULD STILL BE.

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:53.323
THAT THEY HAVE THAT RIGHT AS ACT.

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:54.757
CAN YOU HELP US KNOW THROUGH THE

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:57.460
CHAIR -- NOTE THAT THAT IT WOULD

00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:58.461
BE AN ANIMAL DISSECTION --

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.129
DISSECTION BY ITSELF DOESN'T

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:01.798
REQUIRE THAT HAVE TO BE AN

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:03.533
ANIMAL AFTER DISSECTING.

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:05.468
THE WHAT THAT SECTION WITH THE

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:06.069
COULD BE A MODEL COULD BE THE

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.570
COULD BE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.305
COULD BE THREE TIMES A THREE

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:10.139
DIMENSIONAL IT COULD BE.

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:11.307
ANY NUMBER IT AT THE

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:12.575
DEMONSTRATION THURSDAY THERE

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:21.150
ALSO OTHER PHYSICAL -- TYPES OF

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.719
OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODELING

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:25.388
OF YEAH FROGS AND OTHER THINGS

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:25.922
THAT CAN BE DIE SO YEAH.

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:26.856
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:28.324
THAT THE PUSH FOR THIS IS TWO

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:29.459
FOLD IT AND I UNDERSTAND --

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:30.259
STAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:31.227
AND I AM.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:31.828
I'M NOT I'M NOT CONVINCED ON

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:33.529
THIS AND SO I HAVE SOME SOME

01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:35.198
QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ALLOW YOU

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.399
TO PROTECT POTENTIALLY PERSUADE

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:36.866
ME.

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:37.834
SO.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.469
MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS TWO FOLD

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:42.405
IS THAT ONE DAY EXISTING LAW

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.740
WHICH I GUESS WAS THAT.

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:44.774
JACKIE SPEARED MEASURE FROM TWO

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.209
DECADES AGO WHICH ALLOW STUDENTS

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.410
TO OPT OUT.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.245
IS -- IS INSUFFICIENT AND

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.848
DOESN'T HAVE -- THE OPPORTUNITY

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:53.449
FOR THE STUDENTS TO HAVE.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:55.084
A MEANINGFUL SCIENCE

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:56.786
PARTICIPATION SO THAT'S ONE PART

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:58.521
OF IT AND THE OTHER PART OF YOUR

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.189
ARGUMENT I I THINK THE LARGER

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:02.492
ARGUMENT YOU THINK THIS IS --

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:05.328
IMMORAL AND AND NOT NECESSARY IN

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.330
TODAY'S DAY AND AGE WITH THAT

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:08.498
TECHNOLOGY WELL YEAH CERTAINLY

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:11.768
MORALITY BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:12.368
HOW INSTRUCTIONS BEING DONE I

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.570
MEAN.

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:15.104
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MEDICAL

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:16.005
SCHOOL.

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:18.107
THE BACHELOR'S A MEDICAL TO

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:18.574
PROVE THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:19.142
DISSECTING ANIMALS ARE USING

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.109
TECHNOLOGY.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.177
I MEAN IF YOU REALLY WANT TO

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:23.012
TRAIN DOES THAT MAKE CHOOSE A

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:25.114
CAREER OF THE SCIENCES YOU

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:28.084
TRAINED ON WITH WHAT.

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:28.618
AND EVENTUALLY WILL HAVE A

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:30.019
CHANCE.

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:30.653
TO YOU KNOW THAT I SECOND HOURS

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.621
BUT OF THE POINT IS THAT.

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:33.056
WE WANT TO FIRST OF ALL BEING

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:34.957
CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD OFFER WHAT

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.392
I BELIEVED TO BE THE BEST AND

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.627
NOT JUST ME THAT LOOK LIKE AS I

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:38.961
MENTIONED IS THIRTY FIVE PLUS

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:40.029
STUDIES.

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:40.997
THAT SHOW IT'S COMPARABLE OR

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:43.332
BETTER TO USE ALTERNATE METHODS

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:45.168
THAT ANIMAL DISSECTION AND I

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.403
JUST I SECTION IS ONE ACT SURE --

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:48.871
BUT ISN'T IT CHOICE IN THAT SO

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:49.806
IT'S NOT MEDICAL SCHOOL THE

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:50.673
STUDENTS ARE HIGH SCHOOL

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.208
STUDENTS ABOUT INSPIRING THEM TO

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.977
MAYBE GOING TO STEM EDUCATION SO.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:57.547
YOU KNOW MAYBE THE PHYSICAL ACT --

01:01:57.613 --> 01:01:59.282
THINGY ANIMAL INSPIRE SOMEONE IN

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:01.050
SCIENCE AND AND WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:02.385
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HAVING THAT

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:03.786
OPTION FOR SOON TO DO THAT OR

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:06.722
CONVERSELY OPT OUT LIKE THE

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:07.290
OTHER STUDENTS SAID THAT SHE

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:07.924
DIDN'T HAVE THE I WOULD VENTURE

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:14.330
TO SAY IN FACT JUST BY CHANCE.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.532
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO -- IS STAFFERS

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:17.533
MENTION BECAUSE THE CONVERSATION

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.534
CAME UP THIS WAS CONCERNING

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:19.869
MEDICAL SCHOOL SOCIAL AND TOUCH

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:20.203
IT I SECTION.

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:21.170
THIS CONSIDER THOSE THAT ARE

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:21.971
BEING PUSHED AWAY AT A YOUNG AGE

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:22.572
AND THEY'RE NOT PREPARED FOR

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:23.873
THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY TO NEVER

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.308
GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL I THINK

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:26.642
THAT'S A FAR MORE.

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:27.677
COMMON OCCURRENCE OF SOMEONE

01:02:27.743 --> 01:02:30.079
THAT SPARKED BUT EVENTUALLY GOES

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:31.681
INTO THE SCIENCES THE THE

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:33.015
TECHNOLOGY THE OTHER ALL TERMS

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:36.886
AVAILABLE ALSO SPARK.

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:39.822
GREAT INTEREST IN GREAT DESIRE

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:40.756
AND I HAD THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.525
IS YOUR DAUGHTER REALLY ENJOYING

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.326
SOME OF THEM ON THURSDAY AT THE

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:43.960
BRIEFING AND WAS REALLY COOL TO

01:02:44.026 --> 01:02:44.160
SEE.

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:45.895
BECAUSE OF THIS IS THE KIND OF

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.964
LEARNING THAT MORE MORE THEY'RE

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.565
GOING TO HAVE TO BE A CUSTOM --

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.033
TO MANY EVEN LIFE SCIENCES

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.735
COMPANIES AND OTHER COMPANIES --

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.470
THEY'RE DOING RESEARCH ARE NOT

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.606
USING ANIMALS -- THEY'RE MOVING

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:57.807
MORE MORE AWAY FROM.

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.709
AND SO THE REALITY IS THAT IF WE

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.511
REALLY WANT TO SPARK INTEREST

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:02.845
DESPITE THE INTERESTS I DON'T

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.514
THINK YOU SUBJECT A 100% OF

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.316
STUDENTS. TO THIS ACT OF CUTTING

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:09.418
INDIANA AND ANIMALS TO SPARK

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:10.219
INTEREST THIRD.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:10.720
STRAIGHT SHOOTER BECAUSE

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:12.388
WOULDN'T BE 100% IF IT'S AN

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.057
OPTION AND IN YOU YOU ALLUDED --

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:17.827
TO YES THE LAST NEARLY TWO WEEKS --

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:18.628
ONE OF MY TWIN DAUGHTERS HAD THE

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:20.963
CHANCE TO STUMBLE ACROSS YOUR

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.665
EXHIBITOR DAY AND MESS AROUND

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:25.401
THE IPAD -- TO GREAT SKILL MY

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.170
UNDERSTANDING AND THE OTHER --

01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:28.571
DAUGHTER A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.173
ABLE TO HELP BE PART OF A

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:32.275
DISSECTION OF A PIG AND TAKES

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.576
HEART IN THEIR CLASSROOM.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:36.012
AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT WAS

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:37.513
INTRIGUING AND INTERESTING IN A

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.615
LONG TIME THAT TOO SO I DO SEE

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:42.418
THE VALUE OF A BOTH OF THESE --

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.121
UP THE PIECES AND SO -- WE KNOW

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:47.190
YOUR BILL DO YOU WOULDN'T HOW

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:49.258
ALLOW ANY OF THAT -- TO TO BE

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:50.760
ABLE TO TO OCCUR.

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.929
AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE YOU KNOW

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.530
THAT TECHNOLOGY AND COST I'M

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.032
SURE THERE'S A PREFERRED VENDOR

01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:57.233
WHOSE YOU KNOW CHOMPING AT THE

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.101
BIT RATE AND MAKE MONEY SELLING

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.670
THIS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND YOU

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:03.072
KNOW THAT'S A FACTOR AS WELL AND

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:10.613
SO WOULD WOULD WE BE ABLE. TO TO

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.782
YOU KNOW. TO THIS RIGHT AWAY I

01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:13.416
I'D KNOW THERE'S SOME CONCERTS

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.417
FROM THAT SCHOOL COMMUNITY

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:15.718
BEHIND YOU BOTH THE TEACHERS AND

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:16.352
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS COURSE TO

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:16.652
YOUR RIGHT.

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:17.920
WELL I WOULD I WAS FIRST OF ALL

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:21.924
BE WILLING TO HAVE A TIME PERIOD.

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:23.359
FOR THIS TO GOING TO A FACT

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:24.026
WOULDN'T BE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR SO

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:24.594
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOL

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.928
DISTRICTS TO GET PREPARED FOR IT

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.196
SECONDLY YOU'RE PRESUMING RIGHT

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:28.731
NOW THAT AREN'T VENDORS RIGHT

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:29.298
NOW MAKING A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:30.099
MONEY.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:31.767
OFF SELLING THESE ANIMALS EVERY

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.736
SINGLE YEAR AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:36.005
COST -- THE START UP COSTS --

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:38.174
WHICH ARE OFTENTIMES AT THE SAME

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.509
WAY CHEAPER THAN BUYING ANIMALS

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:42.245
FOR ONE YEAR.

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:42.678
AND SO.

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:44.213
BE IT I DON'T MAKE DECISIONS

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.581
BASED ON WHAT ONE VENDOR IS

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:46.582
GONNA MAKE MONEY WONDERS ARE

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:48.584
THERE ARE DOZENS OF VENDORS THAT

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:50.486
PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES DISSECTION --

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:51.921
AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:52.888
THAT QUESTION YET THAT THING

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:54.390
SOME ONLY ASK THE QUESTION WHO'S

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:55.691
MAKING THE MONEY NOW TO SOMEONE

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:56.892
MAKING A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:58.427
NOW THAT'S PROVIDING THEM.

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.229
ARE THERE JEFF RESEARCHER SAYS

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:01.864
ONCE MORE EXPENSIVE THE OTHER

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.232
JUST MAYBE IT'S A WASH -- I

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:04.300
THINK THAT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:05.868
KIND OF TECHNOLOGY USE I THINK

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:07.436
THAT IT'S A WASHER CHEAPER I

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:08.571
THINK THAT THE ALTERNATIVE TEND

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.640
TO BE CHEAPER BUT THEN IT WILL

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:11.274
BE UP TO THE SCHOOL AS WELL AND

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:11.841
AGAIN.

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:12.742
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:13.976
SOFTWARE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:15.411
MODELS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.046
THAT CAN BE RE USED WAS A ONE

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:18.814
TIME COST YOU HAVE TO REPURCHASE

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.283
ANIMALS EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:22.618
THAT'S AN ONGOING YEAR OVER YEAR

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:23.886
OVER YEAR COST.

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:25.788
OKAY AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISS

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:27.423
THIS AND THEN ALSO SOMEWHERE IS

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:32.895
THERE IS THIS BUT THIS WOULD BE

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:33.496
IT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE THE

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:34.330
FIRST.

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:37.199
STATE TO DO THIS THAT'S CORRECT.

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:38.668
ALRIGHT THAT'S IT IF I IF I

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:39.635
COULD TO THE CHAIR THE THE THE

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:41.504
COMMENT REGARDING WALL IT GIVES

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:42.872
IT.

01:05:42.938 --> 01:05:44.273
THANK EXPERIENCE THAT IS TO MY

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.875

VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES WITH

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:49.345
ANIMAL DISSECTION SOME AND MAYBE

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:51.480
MORE POSITIVE SOME MORE NEGATIVE.

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:52.581
PRESS MY CONTENTION THAT THE

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:54.383
ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE WILL GIVE

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.419
100% OF THE STUDENTS A POSITIVE

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:59.455
EXPERIENCE AND THE EVEN OF ONE

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:01.057
OFFS OUT OFTENTIMES OPT OUT

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.024

THEY'RE NOT GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.227
OF ANYTHING NEARLY NEAR THE

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:07.196
EQUIVALENT OF THAT TYPE OF

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:07.797
INSTRUCTION.

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:10.032
AND IF IT'S TRULY EACH IF IT'S

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:12.401
ABSOLUTELY TRUE THE ANIMAL

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.636
DEATHS AYE SECTIONS OF

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:14.737
UNSURPASSED BY ANY OF THE ANY OF

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.372
THE LEARNING TOOL THE ARGUMENT

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:17.573
SHOULD BE THAT.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.708
IT SHOULD BE MANDATED FOR EVERY

01:06:18.774 --> 01:06:19.875
TEACHER DO IT BUT IT'S NOT IN

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:22.345
FACT IT'S NOT EVEN PART OF THE

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:23.646
SITE IN A REQUIREMENT EDUCATION

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:24.847
CODE OR FOR INTERNATIONAL

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:26.148
BACHELOR PROGRAMS.

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:27.350
NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.251
STANDARDS COLLEGE BOARD IT IS

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:31.420
TRULY UNSURPASSED THAT WOULD BE

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.988
THE CASE BUT IT'S NOT THEIR

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:35.157
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE JUST AS AS

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:36.359
GOOD IF NOT BETTER.

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:37.927
AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE HAVE

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:40.096
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO THE TWO

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.031
OPPORTUNITIES AND SOMEONE CAN

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:43.232
MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT OKAY WELL

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.734
EITHER ONE WILL WORK AND LET.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.602
SOMEONE DECIDE I'M GONNA CHOOSE

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:47.236
FOR THE ONE THAT FIRST OF ALL

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.704
PUSHED PREPARES OUR STUDENTS FOR

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:50.473
THE MODERN WORLD AND HOW THEY'RE

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:51.741
ACTUALLY TRAIN IN THE SCIENCES

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:53.142
I'M ALSO GOING TO CHOOSE THE ONE

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:53.743
THAT DOESN'T PUT.

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.311
STUDENTS THROUGH A REALLY

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:56.379
HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE FOR MANY

OUT LAST QUESTION IF IF WE COULD

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:03.386
ALLOW I THINK THE THE OPPOSITION --

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:05.955
OUTLINED IT THERE IS A COUNTER

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:07.256
PROPOSAL THAT YOU WANTED.

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:08.924
TO THE PROS PROPOSED TO THE

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:10.760
AUTHOR THAT WASN'T AGREED UPON.

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:13.763
THAT DOES THAT RELATE TO THE TO

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.531
THE OPT OUT INTO THE OPT OUT

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:23.506
YEAH CAN YOU ENLIGHTEN US ABOUT

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:24.106
THAT.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:24.907
WELL WE CAN GO IN AND ACTUALLY

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:26.976
LOOK AT HOW -- HOW DISTRICTS IN

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:27.943
HOW DO YOU PROPOSE ON PUTTING

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:28.611
THE INFORMATION IN FULL RIGHT SO

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:30.212
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE --

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.280
BECAUSE OF FOR ME AND OUR

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:32.982
DISTRICT -- AS HIGH SCHOOL

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:34.850
TEACHER WE HAVE TO PUT THE

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:36.285
INFORMATION ON THE SYLLABUS THAT

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.788
THIS IS HAPPENING AND SO THIS

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:40.656
STUDENTS KNOW WAY IN ADVANCE

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.224
SPECIFICALLY ON CLASSES THAT

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.893
THEY WOULD NEED TO DO DIE

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:44.860
SECTION BECAUSE IT IS.

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:46.929
A COLLEGE ARTICULATED CLASSES

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:49.832
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL SO

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.767
WE HAVE TO TELL THEM IN ADVANCE

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.169
WHAT IS GOING ON THE OTHER THING

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.171
THAT WE DO IN THE CLASSROOM.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:58.808
IS THAT WE DON'T START WAIT -- A

01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:03.012
CAT OR A LARGER ANIMAL WHAT WE

01:08:03.078 --> 01:08:03.646
DO IS WE ACTUALLY START WITH A

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:06.081
BANANA. TO DEEPER LOOK AT

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.383
DISSECTION NOT WAY WOULD

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.885
POSITIONS AND AFTER THAT WE KIND

01:08:09.952 --> 01:08:10.786
OF MOVE UP.

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:11.720
IN.

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:13.155
I LOOK AT MY SCHOLARSHIP AND I

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.224
LOOK AT MY STUDENTS AND I GROUP

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:17.426
ON A CERTAIN WAY AND IF I FEEL

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.361
LIKE THEY DO NOT.

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.997
FEEL -- THAT THEY WANTED TO DO

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:24.300
THAT THEY CAN DO A ROTATION.

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:28.037
AND THE OTHER PARTIES IF THEY

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:29.605
OPT OUT.

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:31.407
THEN I GO IN AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:31.907
THEY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.209
ASSIGNMENTS -- I ALWAYS DOUBLE

01:08:33.275 --> 01:08:34.477
VIRTUAL LAP BEFORE HIM BECAUSE

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:35.010
THEY NEED TO FAMILIARIZE

01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:36.512
THEMSELVES BECAUSE WHEN WE DO

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:38.481
THE ACTUAL DISSECTION THAT'S

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:39.982
WHEN WE GO IN MORE AT DEEPER

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.750
LEARNING AND CRITICAL THINKING

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:44.453
ANALYSIS AND THAT YOU CANNOT DO.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.555
WHEN YOU'RE USING A A VIRTUAL

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.157
LAP OR A VIDEO?

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:50.893
BECAUSE IF EACH STUDENT IN MY

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.728
CLASS HAVE A GROUPS.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.330
EACH STUDENT WITH A A HEART THAT

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:56.232
THEY'RE DISSECTING COULD BE A

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:58.267
VARIATION OF DIFFERENT SO WE CAN

01:08:58.334 --> 01:08:59.735
ASK THE QUESTION WHY IS THAT.

01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:01.670
WHY IS THERE A DIFFERENCE

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:04.340
BETWEEN ONE HEART TO ONE ANOTHER

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.208
IN DARKNESS PARKS TO INFLUENCE

01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:08.177
YOU KNOW THINKING LIKE WOW WHY

01:09:08.244 --> 01:09:09.411
IS THAT?

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:10.679
IN SO IT GIVES SOME MORE

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.815
INFORMATION AND TRY TO KIND OF

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:16.018
COOL -- INCORPORATE OTHER POOR

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:17.820
IDEAS THAT'S PART OF THE NEXT

01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:23.325
GENOCIDE STANDARDS AND THAT'S

01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:24.793
VARIATION IN TRAITS.

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.060
THANK YOU.

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:31.300
THE THANK YOU MISTER VERY

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:31.600
[inaudible]

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.235
THE DRUG -- THERE WAS A COMMENT

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:34.370
YOU MADE ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:36.038
THIS IS NOT REQUIRED -- AS A

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:39.174
PART OF THE STATE STANDARDS THIS

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:40.943
SECTION IS NOT IS THAT AND WHAT

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:41.911
AS SUCH IS NOT SPECIFICALLY

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:44.246
REQUIRED THAT IS CORRECT OKAY

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:44.713
AND SO.

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.215
THE OPPOSITION IS ALLEGING THAT

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:50.019
IT IS IS THAT CORRECT NO I DON'T

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:50.252
BELIEVE.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.020
THAT ANYONE SAID.

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:53.322
IT'S NOT THAT IT IS REQUIRED BUT

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:55.524
BY THE NATURE OF THE SHIP'S

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:57.059
DEMANDED WITH THE CALIFORNIA

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:58.460
NEXT GENERATION SCIENCES IT

01:09:58.527 --> 01:09:59.929
LENDS ITSELF TO THAT TYPE OF

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.330
ACTIVITY OF FIVE MAY GIVE AN

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:02.698
EXAMPLE IN MY FOURTH GRADE

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:03.566
CLASSROOM.

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.501
WE STUDY STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:07.503
OF ANIMALS AND I HAVE A SECTION

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:09.872
COMING UP WHEN I GO BACK TO TO

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:10.606
SCHOOL.

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:12.041
NEXT WEEK WHERE WE WILL BE

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:13.442
DISSECTING CHICKEN Vì AND

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:14.743
CHICKEN WINGS AND MY STUDENTS

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.745
THEN USE WHAT THEY LEARN ABOUT

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.380
THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:19.915
THE TENDONS OF THE BONES.

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.584
AND LIGAMENTS IN THE CHICKEN

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:23.852
FEET AND WINGS TO THEN DESIGN A

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:26.455
BIO AND THE BIONIC HAND THAT

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:27.990
THEY USE SO THEY'RE TAKING THAT

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.525
KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY LEARN TO

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:30.859
THAT I SECTION AND APPLYING IT

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:32.695
IN AN ENGINEERING PROCESS AND

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:34.229
NOT PART OF THE SHIPS.

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:36.198
AND THIS IS IN WHAT WHAT GREAT

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:38.033
FOR THAT RIGHT FOURTH GRADE OKAY

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:44.673
OKAY -- IS -- MY CONCERN.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.408
IF THERE IS A CONCERN AYE AYE I

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:47.176
LIKE TO SECTION WHEN I WAS IN

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:48.110
SCHOOL SO MAYBE THAT LITTLE GORY

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:49.211
ABOUT THAT BUT I DID LIKE IT BUT

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:49.812
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO BE

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:51.013
THERE TODAY THAT'S A LONG TIME

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.849
AGO -- MY CONCERN IS IS IS MORE

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.117
IMPORTANTLY THAT.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.652
I DON'T SEE DISSECTION OCCURRING

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.253
IN EVERY SCHOOL.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.055
AND THAT'S MY REAL CONCERN NOT

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:01.557
SO MUCH EVEN THAT SAY SECTION I

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:03.292
DON'T SEE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.661
THAT IS -- HANDS ON THAT

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.630
INSPIRES AND MOTIVATES

01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:08.530
PARTICULARLY IN THE SCHOOLS OF

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.366
THE THE LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.601
LEVEL AND SO THAT MY CONCERN IS

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.036
IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OF THAT.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.437
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WOULD

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:16.939
MAKE MORE OF IT AVAILABLE I'M

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:19.274
NOT REALLY SURE BUT I KNOW THAT

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:20.509
HAVING WORK WITH A WHOLE BUNCH

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:22.311
OF SCIENCE EXT PROGRAMS THAT

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:23.779
EXTERNAL TO SCHOOLS.

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:25.014
WITH HIS AT THE UNIVERSITY OR

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.348
WHETHER IN ONE OF OUR INSTITUTES

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.249
IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:28.751
THAT THAT IS WHAT SPARKED THE

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:31.153
INTEREST OF INNER CITY KIDS THE

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.888
FACT THAT THIS IS SCIENCE ITS

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.690
HANDS ON THEY CAN SEE IT --

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.258
WHETHER IT'S IN A VIDEO OR

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:38.794
WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW -- WHETHER

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:40.829
IT'S VIRTUAL -- THAT'S MY MAIN

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.564
CONCERN AND MAYBE VIRTUAL MAKE

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:44.333
IT MORE ACCESSIBLE -- THAT'S MY

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.734
ANOTHER ISSUE ARE REYES I'M NOT

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:48.303
SURE -- BECAUSE MAYBE THAT THE

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:49.738
INSTRUCTORS HAVE SOME

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:50.372
DIFFICULTIES THEMSELVES DEALING

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:53.075
WITH THAT BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.044
IS THE THING THAT REALLY TURNS

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:56.578
KIDS ON TO SCIENCE.

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.981
AND TOO OFTEN OUR KIDS IT TURNED

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.582
OFF BY CHALKING TALK WHICH IS.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:03.686
WHAT WE DO A LOT OF SO I AM NOT

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:05.487
SURE IF THIS WILL HELP IT MAYBE

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:06.689
IT WILL -- I LIKE MORE

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:08.490
INFORMATION I MAY GIVE YOU I'LL

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:09.625
GIVE YOU MY SUPPORT FOR THE DAY

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.760
BUT I'M REALLY MORE CONCERNED

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:14.063
ABOUT THE FACT THAT I WANT.

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:15.597
HANDS ON SCIENCE.

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:18.000
IN ALL CLASSROOMS BECAUSE

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.435
WITHOUT IT I THINK OUR STUDENTS

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.370
DO NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF BEING

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:23.205
INSPIRED AND IT AND AND ABLE TO

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.473
ASK THOSE CRITICAL QUESTIONS

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.774
THAT YOU SAY YOUR STUDENTS ARE

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:27.076
ABLE TO ASK.

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:29.011
IN A CLASSROOM AND AND WE DON'T

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.412
HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE HANDS ON

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:31.947
EXPERIENCES THAT REALLY TURN

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.515
KIDS ON A TO SCIENCE THEY'RE

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:35.617
VERY TURNED OFF UNFORTUNATELY IN

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.586
SCIENCE IS A VERY EXCITING FIELD.

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:43.859
I AGREE WITH YOU DODD WEBER AND

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:44.426
I THINK THE ALTERNATIVE THE

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:45.594
TECHNOLOGICAL TURN LIVES

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:46.428
INCLUDING HANDS ON ALTERNATIVES

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:47.596
TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:48.864
OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE THE

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:49.431
INTERACTIVE ACTIVITY I ALSO

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:50.466
AGREE WITH APPLY MANY SCHOOLS I

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:54.069
DON'T DISSECT AND IF IT IS THE

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.003
UNSURPASSED LEARNING TOOL --

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:56.271
THEN CLEARLY THE THEIR SCHOOLS

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:57.372
ARE GETTING BY TEACHING WITHOUT

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:58.173
DOING IT AND THERE ARE SOME

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.608
SCHOOLS THAT USE TECHNOLOGY --

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:01.977
MEDICAL SCHOOLS -- CERTAINLY

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.645
PROVIDE CRITICAL ANALYSIS USING

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.681
TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS THAT ARE FAR

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:08.484
SURPASS THAT THAT THAT THAT --

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.085
SURPASS ANIMAL DISSECTION

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:10.686
BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO ANIMAL

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:13.956
SECTION -- AND YEAH AND SO THE

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:15.290
SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:16.959
WAY TO SPARK THAT CRITICAL

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:18.360
ANALYSIS JUST FALLS THERE'S

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:19.661
PLENTY OF HANDS ON OPPORTUNITIES

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.497
TECHNOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:23.132
SPARK OF THAT INTEREST AND I

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.233
AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO BRING THAT

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:25.601
KIND OF TECHNOLOGY TO ALL OUR

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:26.502
SCHOOLS.

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:27.569
AND WE HAVE TO BRING THOSE

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:29.505
OPPORTUNITIES ALL OUR SCHOOLS --

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:30.839
IN SO I THINK THAT THE THERE'S

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:33.308
OPPORTUNITY CERTAINLY TO DO THAT --

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.010
WITH THIS BILL -- BECAUSE I I

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.678
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IN THE LONG

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.380
TERM IT IS A COST SAVINGS TO

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:39.581
SCHOOLS THAT OTHERWISE HAVE TO

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:41.483
EVERY YEAR PURCHASE ANIMALS AND

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:42.017
AGAIN.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.620
AS WE DISCUSSED -- PREVIOUSLY IF

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:45.154
YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.121
DISTRICTS NUMBER ANIMALS AT

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:52.694
THEIR PURCHASING THEY'RE CLEARLY

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:53.629
NOT PROVIDING THIS.

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:54.830
EDUCATIONAL AND I'M I'M VERY

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:55.697
HAPPY THAT WE HAVE TEACHERS THAT

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:56.598
ARE UP OF COMFORTABLE PROMOTE

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.433
THE PRESENTING AND AND PROVIDING.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.668
OF A CURRICULUM AND IT IS A

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:00.803
LESSON PLAN THAT THEY'RE

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:01.436
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THEY THAT

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:02.070
THEY BELIEVE THE STUDENTS ENJOY

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.039
BUT ULTIMATELY EVEN WITH IT AS

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:05.140
PREVIOUSLY STATED BY.

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:07.242
SOME MCCARTY -- BUT WITH THE OPT

01:14:07.309 --> 01:14:08.977
OUT WHAT HAVE YOU LET'S THINK

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:10.078
ABOUT THE REALITY OF OF

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:12.181
TEENAGERS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL OR

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:13.448
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN.

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:14.483
BEING ASKED BY THEIR A THORNY

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:17.052
FIGURE WHETHER THEY WANT TO

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.387
PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING OPT OUT.

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:19.288
A BOMB IN MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE I

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:21.190
DID HAVE TO DO A DISSECTION I

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:21.824
DIDN'T WANT.

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.392
TO BUT I DID IT.

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:24.760
BECAUSE WELL WHAT AM I GONNA DO

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.562
ON ON A TWO YOUNG TEENAGE BOY

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:27.462
GOING TO GO OUT IN THE

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:29.665
PLAYGROUND AT RECESS.

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:30.232
AND HAVE THE KIDS MAKE FUN

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.366
EXCITED ONE OPT OUT TO BE A TO

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:31.834
BE REALLY.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.569
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT ABOUT THE

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.037
CHILDREN AND THE IMPACT THAT IT

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:36.738
HAS TO ACTUALLY PERFORM ANIMAL

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.473
DISSECTION EVEN IF IT SPARKS

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.676
INTEREST AND SOME.

01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:42.477
EVEN BUT TO PUT UP OR WHATEVER

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:45.080
TO ACQUIRE A 100% TO DO IT OR TO

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.415
SEPARATE THEMSELVES AND REST THE

01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:48.350
CLASS I THINK IS A PRETTY -- BUT

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:49.585
IT'S AS A LOT TO ASK OF OUR

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.587
STUDENTS -- AND I JUST WANT TO

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:52.688
ADD ONE MORE POINT I DID MAKE IT

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:53.488
EARLIER THAT THERE IS AN

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:54.723
EXEMPTION FOR SPECIALIZED ACT

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.758
CLASSES -- BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:57.659
THAT I'VE CULTURE COMMUNITY

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:59.695
THIRDS ARE UNIQUE FEELS THAT IT

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:01.296
AGRICULTURE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:01.830
LEND THEMSELVES TO GOING

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:05.033
VETERINARY GOING INTO OBVIOUSLY

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:05.667
RAISING LIVESTOCK WHAT HAVE YOU

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:14.476
SO THERE IS AN EXEMPTION FOR

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:16.912
SPECIALIZED HAD CLASSES.

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:17.579
THANK YOU -- LET ME LET ME MAKE

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:18.780
A FEW COMMENTS ON THIS -- YEAH

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:19.948
I'M AN ANIMAL LOVER I'VE TO

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:20.582
RESCUE DOGS AT HOME I'VE WORKED

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:21.516
WITH SOCIAL COMPASSIONATE

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.551
LEGISLATION -- AND WE HAD A

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:23.185
SIGNIFICANT BILL JUST A COUPLE

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:23.819
YEARS AGO THAT WE GOT THROUGH

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:24.453
THAT WE DIDN'T THINK WE'RE GONNA

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:25.087
GET THROUGH WE DID NOW I THINK

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:27.823
IT'S THE NATIONAL MODEL -- BUT

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:30.359
WHERE I FALL ON THIS IS.

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:32.594
THIS ABSOLUTELY REMOVES LOCAL

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:33.328
CONTROL.

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:35.163
THIS ABSOLUTELY WILL COST MORE

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:36.531
MONEY.

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:38.300
THESE CLASSROOMS DO NOT HAVE THE

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:40.335
TECHNOLOGY TODAY AND IN FACT IF

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:41.803
YOU BUY SOFTWARE YOU CAN

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.938
DOWNLOAD IT YOUR CHROMEBOOK

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:44.439
RIGHT IT'S GOT TO BE ONLINE.

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.108
SO AGAIN -- THIS IS COMING FROM

01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:47.509
A TEACHER SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:50.145
THE CLASSROOM FOR MANY YEARS --

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:52.447
WE SHOULDN'T BE DESIGNING LESSON

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:54.182
PLANS FROM SACRAMENTO.

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.651
WE SHOULD ALLOW TEACHERS TO HAVE

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:58.253
THE AUTONOMY SO THEY CAN BEST

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.988
MEET THE NEEDS.

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.490
OF THEIR STUDENTS SO LET ME GO

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:02.524
THROUGH A COUPLE OTHER THINGS

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:04.126
AGAIN INCREASED COSTS OF HER HE

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:05.160
SAID DEFINITELY.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.129
WILL COST MORE MONEY AND WE EVEN

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:08.964
DID SOME RESEARCH ON HOW MUCH A

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:10.232
FROG COSTS.

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:11.533
SO IT YOU KNOW THIS IS AN

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.201
INTERESTING TOPIC THIS IS ONE I

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:14.536
STRUGGLED WITH THE WHERE I FALL

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:16.338
AGAIN IT IS THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:16.805
ISSUE.

01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:19.541
AND TEACHER AUTONOMY AND ALSO WE

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:20.809
WE SHOULDN'T BE TELLING TEACHERS

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:23.946
EXACTLY HOW THEY CAN OR CAN'T

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:26.748
TEACH WITHIN REASON.

01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:28.150
FROM SACRAMENTO [inaudible]

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:31.286
OUR THERE'S ANOTHER IT'S BEEN

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:34.356
BROACHED UPON BUT WE SHOULD.

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.325
UNLOCK A CHILD'S INTEREST IN

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:38.260
SCIENCE.

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:39.328
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.630
DISSECTION MAY DO SOMETIMES AND

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.665
THAT'S A GOOD THING WE MIGHT BE

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:44.232
YOU KNOW.

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.201
FACILITATING A CHILD'S INTEREST

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.370
IN IN SCIENCE MIGHT WE MIGHT YOU

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.005
KNOW THE CHILD MAY ULTIMATELY

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:51.073
FIND THE CURE FOR CANCER.

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.742
AND AGAIN WE WE SHOULD SUPPORT

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:54.710
THAT IN IN DISSECTION I THINK.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:55.944
MAY DO THAT.

01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:57.512
AND AGAIN IT MAY NOT BUT AGAIN A

01:16:57.579 --> 01:16:58.780
STUDENT CAN DECIDE NOW THERE ARE

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:00.315
OPT OUT PROVISIONS NOW.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.150
AND A LOCAL DISTRICT CAN DECIDE

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:03.652
AS WELL NOW SO.

01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:07.055
I I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING --

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.824
WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE HERE I I

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.993
ALSO HAVE SOME -- YOU KNOW WHERE

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:12.394
WHERE WHERE I THINK WE SHOULD GO

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:13.562
AS AGAIN STRENGTHENING THE OPT

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:15.230
OUT PROVISION.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:18.133
AND ALSO MAY BE REQUIRING THAT

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.434
THE ANIMAL PARTS.

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:21.203
COME FROM ANIMALS THAT WEREN'T

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:22.337
SOURCED SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:24.106
DISSECTION.

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:24.840
I'M QUITE OPEN IN THAT

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.375
CONVERSATION BECAUSE THAT MAKES

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:27.776
SENSE TO ME.

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:28.744
I THINK THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.413
KNOWN DOESN'T HAPPEN SOMETIMES

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.584
NOW -- AND AND AGAIN I I JUST

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.352
FALL BACK ON THE LOCAL ARGUMENT.

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:40.989
AND I I THE UNIVERSITY'S.

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:41.490
THROUGH OUR RESEARCH THE

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:42.524
UNIVERSITY'S.

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:44.459
NOT NOT NOT JUST THE MEDICAL

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:45.727
SCHOOLS DO USE.

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:47.029
ANIMALS NOW AND I SECOND THEY

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:47.996
ALSO USE PEOPLE [inaudible]

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:52.834
AND I THINK I I I THINK I'VE

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:55.103
SAID MY PIECE -- BUT I THINK I

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.605
REALLY WHERE I FALLS A LOCAL

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:58.006
CONTROL ISSUE THE TEACHER

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.042
AUTONOMY ISSUE AND FOR SOMEONE

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:01.176
COOPER SAY IT'S NOT GONNA COST

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:02.310
MONEY YOU CAN JUST DO IT.

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:04.146
I THINK IT'S VERY IRRESPONSIBLE

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.380
WE HAVE.

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.182
SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.750
RADICALLY UNDER FUNDED IN

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:09.751
CALIFORNIA.

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:13.822
SO WITH THAT -- WELL MISS SMITH

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:15.457
ONE SPEAK AYE CULTURES.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:16.191
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:16.725
THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.160
MEASURE BECAUSE AS WE'VE

01:18:18.226 --> 01:18:19.628
DISCUSSED I HAVE -- AS A MATTER

01:18:19.694 --> 01:18:21.063
OF MY PERSONAL BELIEF SYSTEM AND

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:22.764
WHAT MY OWN CHILDREN EXPERIENCED

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:23.932
IN THEIR SCIENCE COURSE WORK IN

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:25.033
HIGH SCHOOL.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.268
I SEE THE NEED AND I DEFINITELY

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:27.602
SEE THE NEED FOR STRENGTHENING

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:29.805
THE OPT OUT COMPONENT FOR FOR

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:30.539
SURE.

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:32.174
NOW THIS WAS JUST ME DECIDING

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.442
ANY ABSENT ANY OTHER

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.911
CONSIDERATIONS I THINK I'D BE

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:37.879
TOTALLY THERE WITH YOU BUT AS MY

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:38.980
COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED A DO

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:39.481
HAVE.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.249
OTHER CONCERNS ABOUT LOCAL

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:43.251
CONTROL ABOUT AND THE AUTONOMY

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:45.187
OF A TEACHER PEDAGOGY IN THEIR

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:47.456
OWN CLASSROOMS AND SO -- I I'M

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:49.491
GOING TO BE WITH YOU TODAY

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.059
BECAUSE I I LIKE THE DIRECTION

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:52.060
THAT THIS IS HEADED I WOULD LIKE

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.463
TO SEE -- YOUNG STUDENTS LIKE MY

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:56.431
OWN WHO REALLY HAD SERIOUS

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:57.699
CONCERNS ABOUT PERFORMING

01:18:57.766 --> 01:18:59.734
DISSECTION HAVE AN OPTION THAT

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:00.869
IS AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:02.204
THAT IS MEANINGFUL TO THEM THAT

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.505
DIDN'T REQUIRE THEM TO STAY IN A

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:04.806
CLASSROOM WHERE THEY FELT VERY

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.775
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE ACTIVITY

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:07.742
THAT WAS GOING ON AND FELT THAT

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:08.477
THEY GAINED.

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:09.778
VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE FROM THAT

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:11.279
PROCESS JUST BASED ON THEIR OWN

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:12.881
PERSONAL OBJECTION SO.

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:14.116
I THINK THERE ARE AND AS THE

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:15.383
CHAIR POINTED OUT A LOT OF AREAS

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.785
THAT I THINK CAN BE WORKED ON

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:18.854
HERE SO -- I I THINK THE AUTHOR

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.155
I THINK THE OPPOSITION I HOPE

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:21.456
YOU'LL CONTINUE ALL OF YOU TO

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:22.757
WORK TOGETHER I DO THINK WE'RE

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:23.859
GONNA SEE.

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:25.293
THIS DYNAMIC CONTINUE TO CHANGE

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.229
I MEAN WE KNOW ALREADY KIND OF

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:27.863
THE MATERIALS THAT HAVE COME

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:29.164
ONLINE AS WE ADOPTED NEW

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.299
CURRICULUM ONCE IN GSS REALLY

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:32.968
STARTS TO UNFOLD IN CLASSROOMS

01:19:33.034 --> 01:19:33.969
WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE I

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:34.536
THINK.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:35.704
HANDS ON MANIPULATIVES THAT

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:36.838
SPEAK EXACTLY TO THAT KIND OF

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:38.240
COLLABORATIVE EXPERIENCE THAT I

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:39.741
KNOW YOU WANT YOUR STUDENTS TO

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:41.276
HAVE SO -- THAT SAID I JUST

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:42.277
ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.345
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:45.614
ULTIMATELY LET'S DO WHAT'S BEST

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.481
FOR STUDENTS LET'S TO DOCTOR

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.183
WILL -- WEBBER'S CONCERNS OVER

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.551
EQUITY LET'S MAKE SURE THAT

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.019
WHATEVER THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:52.454
THERE HAPPENING IN ALL OF OUR

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.856
CLASSROOMS NOT JUST IN THOSE --

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:57.726
IN IN MORE AFFLUENT AREAS AND

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:58.994
MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS IS

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.328
MEANINGFUL IN A WAY THAT IT

01:20:00.395 --> 01:20:01.630
KNOWLEDGE AND ADDRESSES THOSE.

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:02.864
THE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:05.767
ARE STEM MOTIVATED BUT THEN ALSO

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:07.235
FOR FOR KIDS LIKE MINE THAT THEY

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:07.969
HAVE OPPORTUNITIES STILL THAT

01:20:08.036 --> 01:20:09.538
MEANINGFUL SCIENCE EXPERIENCE

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:15.544
WITHOUT BEING SUBJECTED.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:17.612
TO THE ACTIVITY THANK YOU.

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:18.180
GREAT THANK YOU.

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:20.282
BYE DO WE HAVE A MOTION.

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.017
IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED --

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:24.219
MR CALL ARE YOU MAKE CLOSE THE

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:27.222
MOTION IS.

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:28.690
DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:31.826
THANK YOU -- IT JUST ON A COUPLE

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.795
OF THE POINTS AS I INDICATED I

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:35.330
DON'T SUGGEST THAT IT'S THAT

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:36.331
IT'S FOR YOUR DOESN'T COST

01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:37.866
ANYTHING THERE ARE SOME SOFTWARE

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.201
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE FREE BUT

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:40.669
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT.

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:42.037
THERE WILL BE SOME COST INVOLVED

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:44.472
HOWEVER MY CONTENTION IS THAT

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:46.041
IT'S EITHER DEPENDING ON WHAT

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:47.909
TECHNOLOGIES USE EITHER A WASH --

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:48.710
GONNA BE CHEAPER IN THE LONG

01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:50.412
TERM BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.414
NECESSARILY CONTINUE TO BUY AND

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.482
PURCHASE -- OF ANIMALS AS YOU DO

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.917
WITH ANIMAL DISSECTION.

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.185
AND SO.

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:58.520
I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE COST

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:01.156
FACTOR IS ONE THAT SHOULD

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:03.425
PREVENT GOING FORWARD ON THIS --

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:05.093
I ALSO BELIEVE THE EDUCATIONAL

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.461
EXPERIENCE TO BE PARAMOUNT.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.762
AND I THINK THAT.

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:09.497
AT THE END OF THE DAY PEOPLE

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:11.366
MAKE THE STUDENTS MIGHT REMEMBER

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:13.001
THAT THEY CUT INTO AN ANIMAL --

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:14.769
AND MAY BE REMEMBER THAT LESSON

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:16.504
PLAN -- REMEMBER DOING THAT IN

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:22.043
SCHOOL BUT THERE ARE IS THAT THE

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.744
ONLY WAY TO BE ABLE.

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:23.612
TO CREATE THAT CRITICAL ANALYSIS

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:24.746
AND TO TEACH THE REALITY IS

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:25.814
AGAIN ALLUDING TO ALMOST THREE

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.015
DOZEN STUDIES IT SHOWS

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:29.017
COMPARATIVE OR BETTER OUTCOME

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:30.552
FOR THE STUDENT EDUCATIONALLY.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:31.753
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.256
ON BETTER OUTCOMES THAN ANIMAL

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:35.290
DISSECTION.

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:37.759
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE GET

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:38.960
ATTACHED TO DOING THINGS A

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:40.161
CERTAIN WAY AND I LOVE TEACHERS

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.496
I LOVE THE FACT THAT DISSECTION

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.798
HAS BEEN A CRITICAL PART OF MANY

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:46.067
OF THEIR OF OF LESSON PLANS AND

01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:46.701
THE WAY THAT THEY TEACH FOR SO

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.136
LONG.

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:49.037
I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.338
TO BE A TIME OR DISSECTION WILL

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:53.541
NOT BE -- OF A COMMON PLACE --

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:54.876
AND I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:56.444
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE US IN THAT

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:58.113
DIRECTION AS A STATE AND AS A

01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:00.715
NATION -- BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT

01:22:00.782 --> 01:22:02.417
NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT --

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:04.019
WHEN IN TERMS OF EITHER GOING

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:05.287
INTO COLLEGE THE THE ECOLOGICAL

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:08.056
HABITAT OF ANIMALS OR CERTAINLY

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:10.225
HARVESTING ANIMALS FOR THE

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:11.860
PURPOSES AYE SECTION -- IS NOT

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:13.194
GOOD FOR THE ANIMALS MILLIONS OF

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.329
WHICH ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:16.364
NATIONWIDE -- FOR THE PURPOSE OF

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.400
DISSECTION AND I DON'T BELIEVE

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:20.268
IS GOOD FOR THE STUDENTS I DON'T

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:26.241
THINK EXPOSING OR OR HAVING --

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:28.576
STUDENTS -- AND THERE ARE SOME

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:29.177
STUDIES THAT SHOW AS MANY AS A

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:30.211
THIRD OF THEM ARE VERY

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:31.179
UNCOMFORTABLE DOING IT BUT DO IT.

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:31.846
THEY DON'T OPT UP EVEN EVEN WHEN

01:22:31.913 --> 01:22:32.480
GIVEN THE OPTION BECAUSE AGAIN

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:33.815
BUT A LOT OF FACTORS INVOLVED

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.050
INCLUDING HAVING YOUR AT ALREADY

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:35.417
FIGURE.

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:37.352
PUTTING FORWARD A LESSON PLAN --

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:38.787
APPEARS THAT ARE PAYING

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:40.255
ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:41.856
AS WELL AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:43.625
DESIRE TO TRY TO ACHIEVE IN

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.093
ACADEMICS OF A AS MANY AS A

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.261
THIRD OF THE STUDENTS FEEL VERY

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:47.896
UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THEY DO IT.

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:50.165
AND I WOULD ALSO STATE THAT MANY

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:52.667
STUDENTS THAT -- MAY GET SPARKED

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.869
INTO SCIENCE -- CAN GET SPARKED

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:56.538
IN MANY WAYS. TO THE

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:58.907
TECHNOLOGICAL OF OPTIONS BUT I

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:00.241
WOULD DOUBT THAT ANY STUDENT IS

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:01.443
GOING TO BE TURNED AWAY FROM

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:02.711
GOING INTO MEDICINE BECAUSE THE

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:04.179
ALTERNATIVES AND THERE ARE

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.280
STUDENTS TO GET TURNED AWAY FROM

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:06.281
THE SCIENCES.

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:08.149
BECAUSE OF THE OF HAVING TO

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:09.918
DISSECT AS OF SHIRLEY ABOUT

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:11.019
FINDING SOMETHING THAT SPARKS

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:12.954
INTEREST IN ALL STUDENTS WE

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:13.688
SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT'S PARK

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:15.123
STUDENTS IN EVERY.

01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:17.058
IN EVERY SINGLE STUDENT NOT NOT

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:20.462
AT A PRACTICE OF NOT REQUIRED --

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:24.799
THAT -- THAT DOESN'T -- HAD A

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:25.333
100% THE STUDENTS EITHER

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.268
PARTICIPATE OR HAD THAT INTEREST

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:29.404
SPARKED IF THEY GO INTO MEDICINE

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.739
TO BE PLENTY OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:31.940
DISSECTION DOES ACTUALLY

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:33.908
CADAVERS AND YOU NAME IT -- BUT

01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:35.543
I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.645
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:38.980
NOT TO SET A MORAL CENTER BUT I

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:40.548
TECHNOLOGICAL STANDARD AS THE

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:43.151
STATE TO MOVE US IN THE RIGHT

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:43.852
DIRECTION.

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:46.821
AND THE THE THE THE THE OPT OUT

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:48.056
NO DOUBT NEEDS STRENGTHENING BUT

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:49.324
EVEN SETTING THAT ASIDE THE

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:51.559
PRACTICE ITSELF I DON'T BELIEVE

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.328
BASED UPON THE RESEARCH IS AS

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:54.963
EFFECTIVE AS THE EDUCATIONAL

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:56.698
OPPORTUNITY ALTERNATIVES THAT

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.933
ARE AVAILABLE -- SO WITH THAT I

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.001
