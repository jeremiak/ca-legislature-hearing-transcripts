GOOD MORNING KAREN MEMBERS DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA WE CURRENTLY HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE NINTH AMENDED PETITION ON THE BALLOT PRINT BUT WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH DOCTORS OFFICE THE BILL SPONSORS AND THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. PART OF THE BELT CALLS TO REDUCE THE ANTI AND INCENTIVIZE ACTOR TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EXEMPTIONS ARE AND IN A WAY THAT ACCOMPLISHES THESE CALLS WITHOUT HAVING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THAT STILL ALLOWS PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND TRANSPARENCY IT APPEARS THAT AMEND THE AMENDMENT. TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THEM AND MARK DETAIL WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE THE CHAIR AND THE SPONSORS BURKE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER SURE OF NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTERS IN Q. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE MATTER IS NOW BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ETCETERA CASKEY. SO MR CHURTON AND A CENTER WIENER I'M LOOKING AT PAGE EIGHT OF THE STAFF REPORT MAY TALK ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS CAN HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF LIGHT RAIL MAY CAUSE ADVERSE- NOISE AND AIR QUALITY PUTTING IN BIKE LANES MAY IMPEDE THE DRIVER'S VISIBILITY THEN IT POPS DOWN TO THE NEXT PAGE AND NINE. SUBTITLE SIX ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN SOME PEDESTRIANS AND YOU KNOW THE I SEE THE NEW AMENDMENTS THAT JUST WAS HANDED THIS MORNING TO FIND PEDESTRIAN PLAN. AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN WHICH VERY GOOD THEN THESE TALK ABOUT SACRAMENTO HE JUST HAS A DRAFT ACT ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN THE- BAY AREA METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING WANTS TO THERE AREN'T REALLY THESE. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANS. AROUND ME PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT BUT THEY DON'T REALLY HELP TO FIND THEN YOU'RE A THIRD COMMITTEE MEMBERS NUMBER SIX IT SPECIFIES THAT. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANS END OF THIS YEAR PLANS IS NOW DEFINED. ARE NOT ARE STILL SUBJECT TO SEQUEL AND LESS A SEPARATE APPLE POOL EXEMPTION APPLIES. SO WHAT'S NEXT WHAT'S LEFT IF YOU'VE NOW DEFINED THE PLANS WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THESE PLANS BUT THEN PEOPLE WOULD APPLY SEPARATELY FROM. UNLESS YOU GOT IN ANOTHER EXEMPTION THAT IS NOT BEFORE US TODAY. WHAT WOULD BE THE CHANGE IN THE CURRENT LAW I MEAN IF WE HAVE AN EXEMPTION THAT WOULD APPLY DIDN'T WITH WHAT WE NEED THIS BILL I'M GONNA MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MAY HAVE MISTER ROBINSON. JR. FELL ON. SO ED CENTER BECAUSE HE'S I UNDERSTAND THE AMENDMENT THAT'S BEING PROPOSED THEY TO BE PLANNED THE PLASTER PLANS THOSE ARE PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL DOCUMENTS MEETING THEY'RE GONNA DESCRIBE ANY AN ARRAY OF PROJECTS RIGHT THAT THE COMMUNITY MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. AND I BELIEVE WHAT COMMITTEE STAFF IS REALLY GREAT TO IS THAT THAT'S FINE BUT YOU MAY STILL HAVE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS THAT YOU DO DOWN THE ROAD THAT ARE ONE OF THE SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS LISTED IN NINE TWENTY TWO AND THAT PROJECT WOULD REQUIRE OF FUTURE SECRET ALICE IN LESS IT WAS IN. THE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED BY THE BILL. THAT MAKES SENSE- THE- IT. IS IN THE PLAY. IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE. FOR THE SEQUEL I GUESS I WOULD LOOK AT IT TWO WAYS OF IN THE PLAN AND IT'S ALL OUR LIST OF STATUTORILY EXEMPTED PROJECTS THEN IT'S FINE BUT IF IT IF IT DIDN'T MAKE THE LIST OF THE PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY LISTED THE TYPES I SHOULD FACE PATHETICALLY LISTENING NINE TWENTY TWO. THEN YOU WOULD NEED FOR THE FUTURE SEQUENCES THAT MAKE SENSE RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT IF WHO KNOWS WHAT SACRAMENTO'S ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN IS BUT IF THEY CHOSE TO LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND SAY THIS IS THIS IS WHAT OUR PLAN IS VERSUS A CITY WIDE. ROLLING AND BIKING AND WALKING BACK TO TRANSPORTATION PLAN THEY. WOULD BE SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT WHAT. NO DATE THE PLAN WOULD NOT WOULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE THE PROJECT AND I JUST WANT PLANTS OPERATED INDIVIDUAL PROJECT WITH A KIND OF PROJECT ENUMERATED IN NINE TWENTY TWO IT WOULD NOT BE I GUESS I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION TYPES ARE DOING RIGHT I MEAN THEY MAY PUT THE TITLE. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND IN ALL HAS A BUNCH OF PROJECTS IN IT. BUT IF THOSE PROJECTS OR NOT. THE KIND INCLUDED IN OUR TWENTY TWO IT WOULD NOT BE. NINE TWENTY TWO IS SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF PROJECTS ARE INCLUDED. IF THEY PUT SOME RANDOM PROJECT IN THAT'S NOT PART OF THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE EXEMPTION BUT OKAY SO PEDESTRIAN PLAN NOW TO FIND UNDER THE NEW AMENDMENTS WOULD BE A PLAN DEVELOPED BY LOCAL JURISDICTION THAT ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE COORDINATED APPROACH. TO IMPROVING PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAFETY OF SACRAMENTO'S. ACTIVE PROPOSED ACTORS AFTER TRANSPORTATION PLAN DOES THAT BEEN THERE THERE THERE BUT IF THERE ARE. ACTIVE PLAN WHATEVER THE NEWSPAPER SAYING INCLUDES A BUNCH OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS THAT SAY WE'RE GOING TO SCOOP THEM UP. THEN I WOULD THINK THAT PARAGRAPH SIX WOULD SAY IF UNLESS ANOTHER SEQUEL EXEMPTION APPLIES. YOU'RE NOT COVERED. I MEAN AAIN I JUST GOT THIS THIS MORNING SO I APOLOGIZE YEAH I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE I KNOW WHAT I'M VOTING ON LET ME TRY TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE- AND MAYBE THAT'LL SO LET'S SAY IN THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN IT SAID WE WANT TO ADD. BIKE LANES TO. BAKER STREET DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO IN ORDER TO RESTRICT THE PAVEMENT TO ADD THOSE BIKE LANES. THAT SPECIFIC PROJECT ITSELF IS COVERED UNDER THE EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL. LET'S SAY THAT PLAN ALSO SAID. AND WE WANT TO BUILD A BRAND NEW THAT ISN'T CURRENTLY IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY AND IS A MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WITH A BRIDGE OVER A CREEK. THAT WOULD STILL REQUIRE FURTHER SEQUIN HOUSES BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EXEMPTION SPECIFIED IN THE BILL DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. YEAH I MEAN I THINK. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PROJECT ON A PLAN AND AN H. JURISDICTIONS HAS A VERY LIBERAL APPLICATION OF WHAT THEY THINK A PLAN IS VERSUS A PROJECT. NO THE OLD FASHIONED PROJECTS. I THINK I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT WAS SO I'M GONNA. AND JUST. ANYTHING THAT WAS MY QUESTION IS IT JUST JUST SEEMS TO BE THAT WE'RE ONE WE DON'T HAVE THESE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANS THAT EXIST TWO PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING RIGHT NOW IN AND THEN WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW WE'RE DEFINING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN STATE STATUTE RIGHT YEAH AND SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S BODIES AGREE SO WHAT THEY ARE BUT THREE THREE FOR THE FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF WHAT ATP IS ARE WE HIGH IF YOU LOOK AT WHO'S SPONSORING THE BILL AND WHOSE ENGAGE IN THIS BILL IT'S EXACTLY THE ENTITIES THAT ARE CREATING THOSE. PLANS SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE JUST RANDOMLY CREATING- AND THEN EVERYONE'S GONNA HAVE TO LIVE WITH ITS BEING THIS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT DOES EXIST AND YES WE'RE GONNA WILL BE GREAT TO WORK TO BRING A PUT A SPECIFIC DEFINITION IN THE BILL- AND I THINK RECORDS THAT'S OVERDUE BUT IN THE END A SPECIFIC PROJECT IF THEY'RE NOT THE TYPE OF PROJECT ENCOMPASSED BY NINE TWENTY TWO AND THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE BUILDING A BIKE LANE THROUGH THAT'S NOT ON THE EXISTING RIGHT AWAY THAT WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THE BILL WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. PLAN IN NUMBER THREE THE TERMS. IS TASK IS. PROVIDE THE FROM THAT WE'VE- NO AND IT SAYS IT'S A- SO THAT LOCAL. COULD BE. THE MTC IN THE BAY. OR COULD BE CITY AND CAL OF SAN FRAN. FOUR AND ALL THAT DOES IS IT PROMOTE AND- TO CHOOSING. TO CHOOSE WALKING BIKING ROLLING STOCK THROUGH CREATION OF A SAFE OF. A FOR A COMFORTABLE A CONNECTION AND ACCESSIBLE ROLLING. ARE WALKING ROLLING AND BIKING NETWORK SO IF YOU HAVE. THE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU IF YOU HAVE MEANS SOME CITIES AND I'M- FROM FREMONT THEY HAVE A BIKE. NETWORK RIGHT SO THAT WOULD BE. THE IF THEY CAME IN AND SAID THIS IS NOW GOING TO BE OUR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN- THAT WHOLE THING ILL BE CORPORATE RIGHT WELL THREE. TO BE CLEAR WENT UP LIKE THAT. SB TWENTY BUILT ON EXISTING ORDER ALREADY EXEMPTIONS FOR BIKE LANES BIKE NETWORKS SATURDAY WITH I WAS AND WE BALLOT TIED. WITH THAT IN THE BILL- BUT THAT ALREADY RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S SIX THAT'S WHAT I GOT THIS THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS WHAT'S THAT. NEW STUFF THAT'S COMING IN FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION OR PEDESTRIAN PLANS. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE'RE THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF THEM SUCH. A BAD IDEA TO EIGHTY EIGHT ALREADY EFFECTIVELY A CALL LIKE A COMPASS TO ALL THAT I THINK WILL BE MORE SPECIFIC IN DEFINING IT. IN THIS BILL SO IT'S TIGHTENING MAKING MORE CLEAR WAS ALREADY AN INTEGRATED. THANK. YOU MISTER. AND GIVING IT A LONGER. SUNSET YEAH YEAH. OKAY BUT CERTAINLY IF YOU GOT. CAN ARE ADDITIONALLY THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE TO TIGHTEN THROUGH THE PROCESS I LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS UNDER. I SENT DOLLY. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO. HAVE SOME KIND. I FIRST I KNOW YOU DO WORK IN THE AREA AND I. TYPICALLY AGREE WITH WHAT YOUR GOAL IS BUT- I'M I'M HAVING A MAYBE A LITTLE. EXPANDED MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON WHAT. SENATOR WIENER WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THAT YOU KNOW IT CAN BE ENVIRONMENT PROJECT LOOK WITH THIS IS GOOD TO GET PEOPLE OFF OF THE- TO DO DIFFERENT CUT TYPES OF TRANSIT WHERE WE CAN MOVE PEOPLE. IN A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY BUT SEQUEL WAS. DEVELOPED FOR. TO MAKE SURE THAT IMPACTS WERE MET SO SOME COMMUNITY GETS IMPACT IN A DIFFERENT WAY YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THOSE IMPACTS AND SO. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THE- WATERING DOWN OF SECRET FOR. CERTAIN CARVED OUT PROJECTS AND TYPICALLY I HAVE SUPPORT OF THOSE BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE. MAYBE A- DEEPER CONVERSATION ABOUT SEQUEL AND NOT JUST IN THESE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE- MAYBE IT'S MAYBE IT'S THE- KINGS ARENA OR IT'S- SOME OTHER INFILL PROJECT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. BASICALLY PROMOTE BUILDING THROUGH EASING OF REGULATIONS SO IN THIS CASE. THERE'S A% STATEWIDE THIS ISN'T A CARVED OUT ONE PROJECT THIS IS FOR EVERY CITY THAT HAS A TRANSIT SYSTEM OR MAYBE A WERE ALLOWING SECRET EXEMPTIONS AND SO WHEN THERE'S IMPACTS HOW DOES IMPACTS GET DEALT WITH UNDERNEATH THE LAW BECAUSE THERE IS NO NOW YOU'RE EXEMPTING THOSE. YEAH SO A COUPLE OF THINGS AND I WOULD SAID I THINK THAT THE ARGUMENT- CENTER THAT YOU'RE MAKING ACTUALLY. MEANS THAT THIS IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD SUPPORT BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION WHEN A SPECIFIC PROJECT GETS ACCELERATOR CARD THAT USE YOUR SPORTS ARENA- I YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE SUPPORTED- THOSE BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW I THOUGHT FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT WAY WHY ARE WE STREAMLINING SPORTS ARENA BUT NOT HOUSING AND WE CAN AND- THOSE ARE SUBJECT TO CRITICISM WHATEVER ONE'S VIEW. THIS IS NOT DOT THIS IS A STATWIDE POLICY THAT CITIES CAN AND TRANSIT AGENCIES CAN USE OR NOT USE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EVER IN BOCA AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THIS IS DEMOCRACY BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR TRANSIT BOARD CAN MAKE THEIR DECISION ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. AND IF YOU HAVE ONE NEIGHBOR WHO'S UPSET ABOUT IT AND THEN FILES A SEQUEL LAWSUIT THERE ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO I THINK THIS IS A THIS IS PROMOTING. DEMOCRACY AND ALLOW AND A CITY CAN IGNORE IT SO WE DON'T WANNA PUT BIKE LANES AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR BUS SERVICE IN THIS AREA THEY MAKE THAT DECISION UNDER THE BROWN ACT AND UNDER DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES SO YOU KNOW I LISTEN I WAS YOU KNOW I I'VE MADE COMMENTS ON THE SENATE FLOOR IN RECENT WEEKS ABOUT. THAT THERE ARE SOME STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES I THINK AND SEE WHAT IN THAT SEQUENCE TO BE MORE FOCUSED YOU KNOW TO ALSO MAKE SURE IT'S ALWAYS CONTEMPLATING CLIMATE CHANGE- BY THE DOCTORS. AS YOU KNOW THAT IS A- THERE'S A BIG. ISSUE AND IT AND IT'S CONTRA. ON HOPEFULLY IT'LL HAPPEN SOME POINT. BUT I DO. THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY IN THE CITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. WELL I 100% AGREE IN THOSE DECISIONS TO BE MADE BUT SEEK WAS A STATEWIDE LAW. YEAH IT IS NOT IT IS NOT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR- THE CITY COUNCIL DOESN'T GET TO DETERMINE. WHETHER C. BECAUSE IT IMPLIED OR NOT UNLESS WE ALLOW THEM THROUGH LAW THROUGH LEGISLATION WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO RIGHT NOW. AND SO. I THINK THE BGGER CONCERN IS THAT. IS THAT IS SEQUEL. REALLY LEGITIMATE OR IS IT BEEN ABUSED AND I THINK THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE ABUSES OF SEQUEL- I ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE WHAT I THINK IS A GOOD LAW. BECAUSE IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED BY DEVELOPMENT TO BE. YEAH MITIGATION AND TO BE MADE AT LEAST SOMEWHAT HOLE. FOR THEIR IMPACTS AND SO WE CONTINUE TO GO DOWN THE ROAD OF. CARVING OUT FOR THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT OR THE OR THE ABILITY TO GET A LAW PASSED THROUGH THIS. THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE. I THINK WE REALLY SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THE SEQUENCE ALL AND I KNOW YOUR SAY WELL THAT DOESN'T TO PERTAIN TO THIS BILL. IT DOES BECAUSE WE JUST CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT SEQUEL. AND THAT ONE PERSON WITH THE- ATTORNEY OR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP WITH ATTORNEY OR BUSINESS WITH AN ATTORNEY THAT WANTS TO SONST SUIT AND STOP A PROJECT HE SAID THAT IN YOU'RE- ACTUALLY IN YOUR- THE- PRESENTATION OF YOUR BILL. SO THIS IS GONNA ALLOW THAT ATTORNEY OR THAT LOCAL GROUP NOT TO BE ABLE TO SUE IN THE SITUATIONS IN THE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO GO FORWARD. SO IT'S REALLY ADVERTING THE LAW. AND CARVING OUT SOMETHING FOR A STATEWIDE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM SO THAT'S MY POINT IS THAT. WE NEED TO HAVE A LONG WE NEED TO HAVE A BIGGER DISCUSSION ABOUT. SOME ONE ENTITY BEING ABLE TO STOP A PROJECT AND THAT'S QUITE FRANKLY NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT GOOD. AND MAINLY IN HOUSING WE NEVER HEAR WE NEVER HEAR AN EXEMPTION BROWSING THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE FOR SOME REASON WE NEVER HAVE ANY WE DID IT WE DID FOR INFILL. HOTELS I DID FEDERAL SO THAT'S MY POINT IS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND DO ONE OFFS AND NOT YET LEAVES POWER FOR THE LEGISLATORS BUT IT DOESN'T EMPOWER CALIFORNIA DRIVE THE COST OF LIVING DOWN THERE. NICE SO- RISK RESPECTFULLY ASK FIRST OF ALL I I'M A BIG FAN OF NOT MAKING THE PERFECT THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. AND YES THERE A LOT OF AREAS WHERE WE SHOULD DO STRUCTURAL I DON'T THINK. THAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM THESE THREE FAXES AND ARGUMENT AGAINST. MAKING INCREMENTAL PROGRESS IF WE CAN DO THAT'S MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE- TERMS OF HOUSING WE HAVE STREAMLINED. HOUSING THIS COMMITTEE IS TYPICALLY THE THIRD REFERRAL AND THE SENATE HAS NOT BEEN HAVING HEARINGS IN THE THIRD COMMITTEE BUT- SEVENTY TWO COMMITTEE PROVIDES FEEDBACK BECAUSE TYPICALLY TO HOUSING COMMITTEE. AND GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE- STREAMLINING BILLS AND WE PASSED. LAST YEAR SENATE BILL NINE THAT WAS A- THAT CONTAINS SICK WITH STREAMLINING BECAUSE WERE FAVORING ONE DUPLEXES TO BE BUILT- SO I UNDERSTAND. YOUR CONCERN BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STOP- AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP. AN NHS. WE JUST OF THE CONVERSATION NOT AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON- YOU KNOW. WE BUILDING A MASSIVE MANUFACTURING PLANT. NEXT TO IT A SCHOOL IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN BUILDING A BIKE A BIKE LANE THE GOOD LOOK STRIPING ST FOR BIKE LANES OR OR OR A OF YOU KNOW- BUT WALKING INFRASTRUCTURE A MASS TRANSIT LINE I MEAN THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE SO UNEQUIVOCALLY BENEFICIAL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT- THEY THEY I THINK THEY MERIT A DIFFERENT TREATMENT UNDER THE SENATE COULD UNDER THE CALIFORNIA VINYL QUALITY ACT THAT'S MY- ATTITUDE THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE TYPE OF PROJECT IN THE TYPE OF. BENEFIT THAT IT BRINGS TO SOCIETY AND TO OUR ENVIRONMENT OR NOT. ALL RIGHT SO I JUST PUT I JUST PUT THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE AGAIN CONSIDERED UNDER UNDER SEQUIN UNDER VERY DIFFERENT AND CATEGORIES FOR CONSIDERATION AS THE MASS TRANSIT IS A IN IN BEEN BEEN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IS JUST A VERY DIFFERENT WHEN IT COMES OF OUR MENTAL. BENEFITS SENATOR. THANK YOU MR- IN AND I WILL SAY THE OTHER THING IS WITH EXCEPTIONALLY ONE BILL EVERY HOUSING BILL THAT'S BEEN HEARD THIS COMMITTEE ON SEA QUEST IS GONNA COMMITTEE. SO THEY DO NOT DIE IN HERE. OKAY SO MY QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO TWO FACTORS- ONE IS HOW TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING GOOD. FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD CROWDSOURCING OR COMMUNITY INPUT ON THESE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANS ARE PEDESTRIAN PLANS AND I WANTED TO OFFER MAYBE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE AND JUST SEE HOW THE BILL MIGHT APPLY OR MAYBE EVEN HOW THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES MIGHT BE. APPROACHING IT TO SORT OF GET A BETTER SENSE IN MY EXPERIENCE WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT A REALLY GOOD OUTCOMES FOR PROJECTS- THAT SAY THE ENGINEERS AT DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION OR CALTRANS FOR PLANTING THE MEAT OUT OF THIS REALLY APPROACH- PURSUITS ATP GOALS ARE V. M. T. REDUCTION GOALS ARE GHG REDUCTION GOALS. BUT- BUT WHEN WE KIND OF GOT THAT OUT IN THE PUBLIC SPACE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO REALIZE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT SORT OF INTUITIVELY THE COMMUNITY UNDERSTOOD THE MAYBE THE ENGINEERS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. SO EXAMPLE IS THE STREET OVER CROSSING IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY GOING TO BE TORN DOWN BECAUSE IT WAS SAGGING IN GOING TO HIT THE FREEWAY AND SO IS OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. CALTRANS IS GOING TO- JUST TEAR DOWN THE PEDESTRIAN OVER CROSSING AND- HADN'T BUILT INTO THAT PROJECT. WHAT THIS SORT OF COROLLARY. WALKING BIKING ACCESS ISSUES TURNS OUT. TWO BLOCKS AWAY THERE'S ANOTHER- BRIDGE THAT COULD BE UTILIZED BUT WE COULD MAYBE TAKE SOME. SHOP FUNDS RATHER EIGHTY P. FUNDS IN SORT OF UPGRADE. THAT NEIGHBORING STREET AND SORT OF GET BETTER OUTCOMES MAYBE ON BOTH FRONTS. THAT ALL CAME OUT THROUGH THE- I GUESS THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS REALLY AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WAS EVALUATED PER SE. BUT MORE OF A THROUGH THAT NOTICE PROCESS NOT- THOSE COMMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO BE ACCEPTED- AND WE WERE ABLE TO FIND SORT OF. MORE CREATIVE- YOU KNOW THE MORE PROGRESSIVE OUTCOMES SO I'M WONDERING. I KNOW METROS ONE OF THE SPONSORS. I DON'T THINK THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE THOSE ARE MORE CALTRANS PROJECTS AS PEDESTRIAN OVER CROSSING PROJECTS BUT- TRYING TO GET A SENSE FOR HOW. ON THE GROUND IMPLEMENTATION WOULD WORK IN THAT KIND OF CASE CONSUMIR THIS THE ABILITY TO HOLD COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND SOGDIAN EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE DID. SOME MAJOR FLIGHT UPGRADES AND PART OF. A PART PARTS OF A DISTURBING ACCOUNT CUSTOMER MARKET AREA IN GLEN PARK IN SOME OTHER AREAS. WE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO HOLD COMMUNITIES SEEK WITH THE NOT REQUIRED AT ALL. WE HELD COMMUNITY MEETINGS A COMMUNITY THREATS TO GET BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE. THE GOOD THING AND RIGHT THING TO DO WHEN YOU'RE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST GOING OUT AND PUT THAT OUT THERE WITHOUT TALKING TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND GETTING. THEIR FEEDBACK. HI AND I AGREE HAVING THOSE MEETINGS WHEN YOU'RE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS IMPORTANT AND IF YOU'RE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS- LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE LIKE NOT ENGAGING WITH THE PUBLIC. THEY SHOULD BE THROWN OUT OF OFFICE THAT'S DEMOCRACY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR JOBS- BUT WHEN YOU BRING SEQUENCES IT DOESN'T REQUIRE COMMUNITY MEETINGS. BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE TO COMMUNITY. TO DELAY OR KILL YOUR PROJECTS WE RESULT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE OUR BIKE PLAN. GOT SUED UNDERSEA QUOTE NOT FOR ANY ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS BUT FOR THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PROMOTE BIKING I GOT HELD UP AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CREATED THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION. FOR BIKE LANES- AND SO I YOU KNOW I THINK WE NEED TO YOU KNOW. FOCUS ON LIKE HAVING GOOD LOCAL DEMOCRACY. AND YOU CAN NOTHING SICKLE REQUIRES COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND NOTHING THIS WILL NOT TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY TO HAVE COMMUNITIES REQUIRES A FOR LARGER PROJECTS- BUT OF COURSE. LOCAL OFFICIALS SHOULD ALWAYS BE ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY AS A MATTER OF BASIC DEMOCRACY THEY SHOULD BE THROWN OUT OF OFFICE WHO CAN I ASK I DON'T KNOW IF ONE OF THE SPONSORS ON THE LINE OR- MISS ROBIN CENTER WHO'S RIGHT FROM THE LINE BUT JUST. THE INTENT OF METRO AND HOW THEY PLAN TO PURSUE THIS LIKE YEAH IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S AN OPTION ARE THEY INTENDING. TO IMPLEMENT. OUR DOCTOR PLAN THAT THE WAY. I MEAN. BECAUSE IT'S JUST. NOW WITH THIS IN AND WE WERE. REQUIRED UNLESS YOU OVER A HUNDRED. IT WOULD HAVE TO KNOW YEAH AND SO MISTER TURNER IS ON THE LINE FROM ELEMENTARY YEAH. YES THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER US MICHAEL TURNER FROM ELLIE MET FROM WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT WE PURSUE THAT ARE. ORISHA SHOULD SAY WERE EXEMPT UNDER- LITTLE SEQUEL BEFORE SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT- EVER EXISTED AND WE HAVE ALWAYS PURSUED VERY AGGRESSIVE COMMUNITY OUT REACH ON THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS- FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE PROJECT WE'RE LOOKING AT- SOME BUS SPEED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE NORTH SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. THAT WERE EXEMPT BEFORE SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT EVER EXISTED AND WE HAD- EXTENSIVE NUMBERS OF PUBLIC MEETINGS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT SEQUEL WOULD HAVE EVER REQUIRED. SO IT'S A REGULAR PRACTICE HERE FOR US TO ENGAGE IN VERY EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OUTREACH. BUT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS ARE DO YOU MIND IF I ASK ARE YOU BOUND TO THAT REGULAR PROCESSES THAT JUST SORT OF A MATTER OF PRACTICE OR IS THE- IS THE INTENTION SAY OF METRO I MEAN I THINK OF THEM THE BIG METRO. PROJECT AND IS IN THE NORTH SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WORK IS THE ORANGE LINE SO FOR SO YOU WERE ONLY DOING ONE OVER CROSSING RIGHT NOT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT BUT A- THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR- OVER CROSSING WHICH WE WANT TO SEE. A LOT MORE THOSE AND SORT OF GET THAT THAT BRT LINE GOING. BUT LIKE DOES THAT. WITH IF THIS BILL WERE LAW. WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO UNDER METRO'S CURRENT SORT OF. PROCESS FOR A PROJECT LIKE THAT. WELL I THINK WHAT I'D SAY IS THAT IF WE WANT THE PROJECT TO SUCCEED IN AS SENATOR WIENER MENTIONED IF YOU WANT THE PROJECT TO BE ACCEPTED IN THE COMMUNITY BE SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO HAVE COMMUNITY BUY IN- YOU KNOW SEE WHAT HAS SOME VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO HEARINGS AND- SCOPING SESSIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THE ON GOING- LADY COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN A PROJECT IN CONSENSUS BUILDING AROUND THAT PROJECT IS WHAT ULTIMATELY GAMES- THE ACCEPTANCE. SO IT IS SOMETHING WE DO ON YOU KNOW OUR MAJOR PROJECTS FROM THINGS LIKE SIMPLE TO PASS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO- THINGS THAT YOU KNOW SMALL PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS- THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY BUT IT DO DO DO BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO OR BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO MAKE POLICY I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU'RE OBLIGATED TO DO SO IF YOU WOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION WHETHER OR NOT TO TALK TO THE COMMUNITY ABOUT IT. IN THEORY ON ONE OF THEIR THERE L. WITH OTHERS THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED AT ALL BUT THEY THEY ARE I WOULD SAY THEY ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET A PROJECT TO BE ACCEPTED AND SUCCESSFUL IN THE COMMUNITY DID YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU DON'T DO THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF CONSENSUS BUILDING THAT'SONE OF THE FACTORS THAT LEADS TO LAWSUITS UNDER CEQA WRIT THAT WITHOUT ANY RECOURSE FOR A LAWSUIT UNDER SEEK WITH. AND WITHOUT ANY HARD REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE THAT INTERFACE INTERIOR AGENCY COULD CONSTRUCT A YOU KNOW A NINETY NINE MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT AND NOT HAVE ANY COMMUNITY MEETINGS OR TAKE ANY PUBLIC. INPUT IS NOT RIGHT UNDER THE BILL. IN THEORY CORRECT YEAH. BUT SOME COULD STILL THROUGH FOR UNDER THE- UNDER THE SEAT FROM XIN. IT WOULDN'T BE BAY ON CERTAIN ON THE OUT. BUT RIGHT BUT JUST AS A MATTER OF ROSS SAYS HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WRITE IF I. ADD THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK. IF IT'S GOING TO BE EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CONFRONT THE RATE WE'RE NOT TALKING TO ANYONE. RIGHT THERE MIGHT COULD THERE BE A RANDOM CITY WITH WITH THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE DUBBED THE SURE YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE. BAD LOCAL OFFICIALS BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THERE'S THERE THERE IS ENGAGEMENT. BUT AGAIN THE DOWNSIDE OF NOT HAVING THE EXEMPTION IS YOU HAVE A PROJECT WE'VE ALL SEEN THIS WERE 90% THE COMMUNITY LOVES. IT'S LIKE BROADLY EMBRACED AND ACCEPTED. BUT THAT ONE NEIGHBOR WHOSE VIEW IS BEING BLOCKED BY THE PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE OR WHATEVER AND HAS ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE A LAWYER SUITS AND TIES IT UP FOR YEARS AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOT JUST ON THIS KIND OF ISSUE BUT OTHERS WELL. AND SO IT'S ALWAYS A TRADE OFF. ALWAYS A TRADE OFF AND I DO THINK THAT OVERWHELMINGLY- LOCAL. GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TRY TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITIES THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE. PEOPLE COME OUT PITCHFORKS AND BE FURIOUS THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS I WANT TO TRY TO YOU KNOW GAIN AS MUCH ACCEPTANCE IS POSSIBLE. I WOULD JUST ASK FOR YOUR CAN. EITHER YOU YOURSELF IS THE AUTHOR OF THIS OR THE SPONSORS. IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO- ACTIVELY AFFIRM FOR PROJECTS REGARDLESS OF SIZE SOME KIND OF- NOTICE OBLIGATION- IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE- EXACTLY THE PROCESS YOU YOU LAID OUT IS THAT SORT OF ALTERNATIVE COMMUNITY MEETING PLAN FOR A HUNDRED MILLION PLUS PROJECTS BUT- I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. TO DO SOME OF THAT GOOD. TO NOT JUST MAKE IT AN OPTION TO SORT OF GIVE YOU SOME ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL THEN BE THUNDERY WE WILL YOU HAVE MY CAN AND WE WILL GIVE THAT. OKAY ON TO DO SOME CREATIVE THINKING OKAY REDRESS FOR CONCERN I PROCEED TO AND THE ONLY OTHER ONE I JUST WANTED YOU TO CONSIDER POTENTIALLY IF THE BILL IS FOR BEFORE THE FLOOR. I'M MORE APPROPRIATIONS OR WHATEVER MAY BE- IS. IN IN THE IN THE SORT OF FACTORS ANALYSIS I KNOW THAT RACIAL EQUITY AND DISPLACEMENT WERE WERE CONSIDERED WE'RE BACK TO HEAR LEGISLATION THAT YOU TALK ABOUT SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS- AS WELL BE SORT OF A- A CONSIDERATION GOING FORWARD. I'M JUST TRYING TO I'M WONDERING. THE IT DOESN'T SAY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IT SAYS- TO ENCOURAGE CONSIDERATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANS INDUSTRY AND PLANS- AND THEN IT ALSO HAS THAT SORT OF COROLLARY PEACE AND RACIAL EQUITY AND DISPLACEMENT- THIS. SOME CONSIDERATION OF. SPECIFICALLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE NOT JUST- SEE AN ECONOMIC ONE BUT- BUT IF THIS COMMITTEE OF THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY HAS HAD IS TAKING THE LION'S SHARE OF INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS AND THERE'S A WEALTHIER COMMUNITY EXTORT THAT. HOW TO FOR SAID TO GET FLUSHED OUT IT THIS BILL DOESN'T INCLUDE INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS BUT AS YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU AREN'T SUGGESTING- BUT STILL IT'S FOR HIGH HYDROGEN STATION OR LICENSES TO RID RID WILL REQUIRE COMMUTING TO TRACK AT ANY LEVEL TO TAKE A MOMENT WORK SOMETHING FROM THE COMMITTEES BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE KINDS OF PROJECTS SOLICITORS DOESN'T INCLUDE DIESEL THIS IS ABOUT YOU KNOW IT'S A FAIR INDICATOR ABOUT CLEAN PROJECTS. AND SO THE IDEA THAT WOULD REQUIRE SPECIFIC THAT KIND OF CONTAMINANT IN ALICE'S- ON EXISTING RIGHT OF WAY RIGHTS NOT ABOUT BUILDING A NEW RIGHT OF WAY AND SO I- YOU KNOW WE WE'VE WHEN AT OUR OUR SPONSORS HAVE ENGAGE ENGAGE EARLY WITH THEIR- BUYER MENTAL JUSTICE VIJAY COMMUNITY AND WILL CONTINUE OF COURSE ENGAGE WITH THEM AND WE'RE HAPPY TO YOU KNOW WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A RACIAL EQUITY ANALYSIS PART IN THE BILL WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE DISPLACEMENT. ANALYSIS BUT AT SOME POINT YOU END UP CENTER HESYCHASM SYMBOL WERE REPORTING EVERYTHING ABOUT SEE WHAT AT SOME POINT THAT BECOMES A CHALLENGE AND I THINK THE RACIAL EQUITY AND DISPLACEMENT ALICE'S COVERS AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT ABOUT- WHAT IN MY EXPERIENCE IS A ORGANIZATIONS YOU KNOW BUT FOR THAT THAT WOULD BE REASSURING I GUESS IF WE COULD I KNOW THAT THERE NOW IS IT DOESN'T SAY SPELL IT OUT. BUT TO UNDERSTAND ANALYSIS WITH X. ENTAIL. AND HOW MUCH OVER THERE MY BE WITH THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL. FOR AND WHAT MIGHT BE LEFT OUT MAYBE IT'S NOT A CONTAMINANT IN ALICE'S FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE- LIKE YOU SAID IT IS NOT REALLY GERMANE TO THESE PROJECTS BUT- BUT- I. I ALWAYS AM JUST CONCERNED ABOUT- YES THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PIECE OF IT NOT JUST AT. SOME SORT OF RATE- INDIRECT RACIAL IMPACT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THAT WOULD EVEN LOOK AT ME BUT IF YOU. IF YOU ARE PROJECTS DIRECTLY THAT WAS GOING TO BE CAUSING SOME SORT OF MASSIVE CONTAMINATION. FLOWING ON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES RIGHT I'M MORE THAT WAS INVOKING SB NINE. TWENTY TWO THAT TO ME THAT'S FOR RACIAL EQUITY. ISSUE AND SO THAT WOULD BE. HELLO THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROJECT WILL BE RIGHT PERSONALLY BUT IF THE RADICALLY SPEAKING- I THINK IT. THE SPONSORS A SENSE OR OR THE THOSE ONLINE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW YOU WOULD A RACIAL EQUITY OR- OR DISPLACEMENT OUT AND ANALYSIS MIGHT LOOK LIKE THEY WOULD COVER SOME OF MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PEACE ANY REASSURANCE TO OFFER. AT THIS EARLY STAGE I ALSO JUST ONE NOTE YEAH PLEASE THAT WENT ABOUT THE AGAINST. EXISTING RIGHT AWAY I'M PART OF THAT YES WE ARE THIS IS NOT ALLOWING SOMEONE TO BUILD A LIGHT RAIL LINE. THE MONEY NEW HOMES SURE EXISTING COMMUNITY ALL OF THE CALLS ABOUT AND IT'S AND IT'S WRITTEN NOT BE ABOUT THE IDEA. UNDERSTOOD BUT ANY ANY COMMENTS EITHER I DON'T KNOW AND YEAH PLEASE PREVENT- THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH THE CHAIR TIMELINE FOR THE- WE HAVE YOU- SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT IN ORDER EMPLOY A JUSTICE PLANS UNDER THE BAYVIEW COMMUNITY BASED TRANSPORTATION PLAN AS WELL AS WORKING VERY QUICKLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES IN THE TENDERLOIN NEIGHBORHOOD TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHANGING TRAFFIC AND SAFETY CONDITIONS IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO QUICKLY REARRANGE THE STREET. CREW AND OF ADVOCATE- PATH BEHALF OF. JUSTICE ORGANIZER- SO. WE EAGER TO ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SEQUEL IT IS EIGHT CLUMSY AND LEGALISTIC COOL HOWEVER IN DOING SO. THE COMMUNICATION PROPHECIES THAT ARE SET UP AND SEE WHAT. OUR LEGALIST THEIR DESIGN AROUND LEGAL DISCLOSURES AND THEY'RE DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH LAWYERS- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ACTUALLY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER TO HELP THEM PRIORITIZE WHAT ARE THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM INVESTMENTS THAT ACTUALLY NEED THEIR REAL NEEDS AND THEN MOVES VERY QUICKLY AND IMPLEMENTING THOSE- SO THE KIND OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORK THAT WE DO IS. IS NOT THE KIND OF ENGAGEMENT THAT SEQUEL- ACTUALLY FOSTERS- AND SO WE- OR YOU TO VOTE AYE ON. NINE TWENTY TWO. TO SEE THE URGING RIGHT NOW I PRETTY YOUR JIM MIKE MICHAEL WAS IF YOU WOULDN'T BE OBLIGATED UNDER THIS BILL TO DO ANY OF THAT ENGAGEMENT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT YOU COULD SKIP THAT ENGAGEMENT IS STILL BE COMPLIANT WITH THE LAW. COULD YOU NOT. THAT IS CORRECT HOWEVER SEQUEL IS NOT DESIGNED TO FOSTER THE KIND OF ENGAGEMENT THAT IS HELPFUL TO KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT EVEN THE- EVEN THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE BILL FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PLUS PROJECTS. FOR ANYTHING SOUTH OF THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY OF THAT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- THAT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ENGAGE WITH EACH OTHER AND I MEAN WOULD YOU LIKE I WE TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL I THINK YOU BROUGHT UP AN INTERESTING IDEA OF THIS NOTICE OBLIGATION AND THEN THERE'S THE THRESHOLD RIGHT I MEAN- WHAT. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR AND THE CAN THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT MAYBE LOWERING THE THRESHOLD FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS- YEAH THE HEARINGS AND JUST HOW TO ALLOW FOR THAT DISCUSSION THAT THAT THE SENDER SO CONCERNED ABOUT. IT BECAUSE I'M NOT MAKING ANY COMMITMENTS TODAY ON THE UNDERMINE WE'VE ALREADY ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WERE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IT WAS OF INDICATED. AND TALK ABOUT THAT AND I DO HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WILL. IN GOOD FAITH HAVE A CONVERSATION. BUT I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR I'M NOT. LETTINGS NO I UNDERSTAND CENTER BUT IT BUT- BY ARE YOU ARE YOU. I THINK HE'S I IDEA OF THE YOUR WITNESS GOING TO THE CLUB NATURE OF A SEEK BUT I NOT SURE THE CENTERS FOR A FULL SEQUEL A REVIEW HE'S LOOKING FOR MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR DITCHED A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC NOTICE AN INPUT YOU CAN CHECK MY SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS A VERY ACTIVE AND ENGAGED COMMUNITY THERE A LOT OF PLACES IN THIS IN THE STATE THAT MAYBE AREN'T AS MUCH MAYBE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE QUITE AS A CONSCIENTIOUS. ABOUT ENGAGING- THE PUBLIC ON ON PROJECTS THAT MIGHT BE CONTROVERSIAL AND I AND ONCE AGAIN WHAT HE'S ASKING FOR DOES NOT NOT DOESN'T ULTIMATELY GIVE A OF A KIND OF A TRUMP CARD TO UNTIL TO SOMEONE TO A TO A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT WHO CAN HIRE A LAWYER BUT BUT ULTIMATELY JUST PROVIDES FOR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEANINGFUL PUBLIC. ENGAGEMENT INPUT IN THAT WERE WERE OPEN THAT CONVERSATION- AND SO WORTH IT WILL GIVE THAT SOME THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE I'M NOT MAKING A YEAH I UNDERSTAND- IS ALL LIKE YOU ON THE FLY YOUR- BUT WERE WILL ROAD OKAY CONSIDERING THAT I DO WANT TO SAY I WAS REMINDED THAT- ON THE RACIAL EQUITY ANALYSIS. BECAUSE OF SB TO RADIATE OPR HAS ALREADY PUT OUT GUIDANCE. ON WHAT THAT MEANS. I PER- I CONFIDENT THAT THIS PATH. AND THE LAW. BILL UPDATE. BECAUSE OF THIS. HE'S ADDED AT. THE OPR IS ALREADY PUT OUT GUY- ON THAT EACH CERTAINLY GO AND TAKE A LOOK- AT THAT KIND OF. SO WITH THAT I'LL- I'LL BE SO. THE MEASURE TODAY- AND THE- GREEN ISING SOME OF THESE ISSUES VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE THE FLOOR SO APPRECIATE THAT THE ENGAGEMENT THERE AND- ESPECIALLY FROM. THE LOCAL AGENCIES IN. IN MY BACKYARD I SORT OF. I'M I'M HOPING WE CAN DO SOME FOLLOW UP THERE AND JUST GET A REAL. SENSE OF. HOW TO. MAINTAIN THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC THAT. THIS IS THE THESE KIND OF PROJECTS WE WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT. I'M NOT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. SKIRT FROM PUBLIC VIEW. OKAY WHAT WILL BE AND- WILL BE IN TOUCH. THEM OKAY YES. I'M OF THE- A THANK YOU CENTER. I'M OKAY. HI LOOK I THINK WE'VE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THE BILL AND I I'D LIKE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE INPUT FROM ALL OF THEM THE SENATORS AND- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. ON THIS ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN ISSUE I AGREED SENATE WITH CASKEY- WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR TO SOME SORT OF. LOOPHOLE OR OR WORK AROUND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND YOU KNOW. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TIED A BILL DEFINITION LANGUAGE THERE CERTAINLY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU CENTER WITH CASKEY AND- THE AUTHOR. AND THEN I JUST KIND OF REITERATING THAT THE- THE ISSUES RAISED BY CENTER STERN AYE AYE I DO HOPE WE CAN FIGURE OUT A PATH CENTER WIENER- TO ENSURE THAT THERE BE. LET THE COR CONCERNS THAT HE RAISE NOT NOT NOT NOT ALLOWING FOR. FOR PROJECTS TO BE STOPPED BUT FOR THE YOU KNOW THE YEAR. BASED ON ONE PERSON'S CONCERN BUT THAT THERE THAT BUT THAT. THERE REALLY BE MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. THAT WOULD HAVE TO INFORM THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. R. FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT ARE- A LESSON HOW TO MILLION DOLLARS. AND SO LET'S WORK ON THAT AFTER YOU GET A CENTER. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT THAT THE BILL'S REMOVED YOU MAY CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL ROLL.

ME FOR HOW RIGHT OKAY PERFECT. OKAY ARE SIMILAR PROCEEDS SB TEN NINE FIVE ITEM NINE IN YOUR MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MR CHAIR AND- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR ON THE COMMITTEE STAFF- FOR YOUR THOROUGH ANALYSIS- AND FOR ENGAGING WITH US I KNOW THIS IS A BETTER MORE FOCUSED BILL I ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED ON PAGES NINE AND TEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WITH HIS OF THESE AMENDMENTS SB TEN NINETY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE THE- CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO TAKE ACCOUNT. OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED ACTIONS ON RACIAL ETHNIC AND GENDER SUBGROUPS THIS BILL ESTABLISHES MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR CARBS SOCIO ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS. IT ALSO SETS CRITERIA FOR HIRING THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS IF TO FALL PERFORM THESE ASSESSMENTS. THE PROPOSED MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR CARBON INCLUDE ASSESSING WHAT IMPACTS THEIR PROPOSED ACTION COULD HAVE ON EMPLOYMENT. AND THE ECONOMY OF THE AFFECTED REGION AND A BASELINE ESTIMATE OF THE COST REVENUES INCOME AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THIS IS A DUPLICATE OF. CARBS CURRENT ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS HAVE A GOOD BASELINE OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION BUT THEY DO NOT ALWAYS LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LAST YEAR THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTED THAT CAR HAS NOT ADEQUATELY ADEQUATELY DEMONSTRATED THE SOCIO ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF ITS PROGRAMS AND THAT CARP CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S PROGRAMS ACHIEVE SOCIOECONOMIC AND JOBS BENEFITS. CARP IS NOT COLLECTING THE DATA TO ILLUSTRATE HOW BENEFICIAL THE PROGRAMS MIGHT BE WE NEED THEM TO FOCUS ON THESE COMMUNITIES WHEN DROPPING NEW CLEAN AIR RULES. THIS BILL ENSURES. WE ARE NO LONGER MISSING THIS KEY COMPONENT THE POTENTIAL HARMS OF OUR ACTIONS ON THE PEOPLE WHO THROUGH THEIR HARD WORK KEEP OUR STATE MOVING AND THRIVING. IS THE TEN NINETY FIVE CHALLENGES THE NOTION THE TALKING ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF REDUCING PARTICULATE MATTER IN THESE COMMUNITIES IS ENOUGH WE MUST TALK ABOUT THE-COST ON THE SAVE COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO PUSH THAT UP TO THE SURFACE. IF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON WORKING CLASS CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT TALKED ABOUT THEN THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED. FOR EXAMPLE CARP ADMINISTERS INVENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR CLEAN CARS INCLUDING THEIR CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT CARP MISSED CLEAR OPPORTUNITIES TO ASSESS WHETHER THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM ACTUALLY PROVIDES SOCIO ECONOMIC BENEFITS. IN A TWENTY TWENTY SURVEY BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION REVEALED THAT RESIDENTS OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND HIGHER INCOME CALIFORNIANS HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO HOME CHARGING. THE SURVEY FOUND ADDITIONAL DISPARITIES AMONG RACE AND ETHNICITY GROUPINGS MOREOVER ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COSTS FOR NON HOMEOWNERS FOR CHARGING ELECTRIC VEHICLES. FAR EXCEED COSTS FOR CHARGING AT HOME. AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE POLICIES ARE OFTEN REGRESSIVE CLIMATE POLICIES FELT MOST DEEPLY IN THE LIVES OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WELL WE TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING THESE COMMUNITIES. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE HARMFUL IMPACTS THAT OUR ACTIONS WILL HAVE ON THEM SUCH AS JOB LOSS RISING COSTS NO ACCESS TO CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND LACK OF TRANSPORTATION. OFTEN AIMED AT CHANGING BEHAVIOUR ARE AMBITIOUS PROGRAMS HAVE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ON THE OTHER HAND ARE CLIMATE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS REACHING THESE COMMUNITIES. THE GENDER EQUITY POLICY INSTITUTE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT OUR CLIMATE RESILIENCY INVESTMENTS THEIR ANALYSIS OF OCCUPATION DATA OCCUPATIONAL DATA INDICATES THAT IF WE ARE NOT THOUGHTFUL ABOUT OUR INVESTMENTS 92% OF THE JOBS POTENTIALLY CREATED BY THESE INVESTMENTS WILL GO TO MEN. WE CANNOT MITIGATE THESE HARMFUL OUTCOMES WITHOUT KNOWING THE FULL PICTURE OF OUR POLICIES ARE AFFECTING BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR EVERY POLICY COMES WITH BENEFITS AND BURDENS AND WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT BOTH ARE SHARED EQUITABLY. TODAY THANK YOU FOR THAT ON TODAY WE HAVE OUR EXPERT WITNESS ON THE LINE ROXANA TIENEN SHE IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES ALLIANCE FOR A NEW ECONOMY THANK YOU MR THANK YOU SENATOR- MISTIMED YOU MAY RECEIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK THAT MIGHT. COMMUNITY ADMITTING TODAY- MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT L. A. ALLIANCE FOR A NEW ECONOMY. HAS BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS. I AND IT HEARING THAT CRYING WE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON FIGHTING FOR. CONNECTIONS BETWEEN QUALITY JOBS RACIAL JUSTICE AND SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TODAY TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY ABOUT SB TEN NINETY FIVE AND THE COURTS- YEAH WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T ACHIEVE OUR STATE REALLY AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS WITHOUT ENSURING THAT. WORKERS IN THESE INDUSTRIES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE REALLY BENEFITING- ALL OF THAT SAID REALLY AMBITIOUS- THE PROPOSAL THE STATE HAS HI AND GOAL STATE BACK. FOR MANY YEARS WE WORKED WITH ALLY LIKE I DEFINITELY ME THEM GO IN SOUTH AYE FINANCIAL. LOOKING AT- ARE FUTURE TWENTY THAT IT WE TRANSIT QUICKLY CON. BACK WE'RE NOT WE PEOPLE. THAT PUBLIC AND SERVICES. ARE GETTING ACCESS BY THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO CLEARLY THOUGHT THAT THE WORK AND OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT WERE NOT SUBSTITUTE BAD JOB FOR ONE IN THE TRANSITION- YOU KNOW WE NOTE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE WORST. IMPACT THE WORST AIR QUALITY IMPACT WHAT THE BE BOLD DRIVING THE SOLUTION. AND THAT WE CAN'T GET THROUGH THOSE EQUITABLE SOLUTION BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FACTS ARE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ANALYZE THE IMPACT. OF OUR EXISTING POLICY- YEAH I WAS GIVEN THE HISTORY THAT THAT AS MANY OF US ARE AWARE OF BUSINESS EIGHT- OF RACIAL SEGREGATION- OF RED LINING UP LACK OF ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND- INEQUITABLE- THANK HARM. ALL OF THOSE HOLLOW THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMPANY. OKAY ACCESS- MORE SERVICE AND THOUGHT AND TRANSIT AND I IN FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO WE WERE AT THE YOU CAN BUY- LED THE- WITH SPENDING MONEY. ON OUR DOORSTEP CITY. AND YOU KNOW THE- FOLKS WILL BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT PER CAPITA SPENDING RALLY RATE PAYERS ON SOLAR. IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES. I ABOUT THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS WITH BEING SPENT PER PERSON AND IN WEST LOS ANGELES. FIFTY THREE DOLLARS AND SIXTY THREE CENTS WITH BEING SPENT KIRSTEN- WE LOOK AT WHAT WHERE THIRTY SEVEN THAN WITH BEING SPENT PER PERSON UNTIL INVESTMENT AND IN BEL AIR. WHERE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CUSTOMER BEING SPENT SO THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS. IS REALLY CRITICAL IN ORDER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE POLICIES THAT WE ARE PROPOSING. COMING OUT OF THAT LADWP CREATED COULD BE METRICS THAT THEY HAVE TO REPORT ON EVERY YEAR WHAT THEY'RE ANALYZING HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR MONEY TO ANALYZE THE TAKING ADVANTAGE IN WHICH NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES. AND THAT REALLY HELPED THEM UIDAI RACK. THEIR BUDGET. THAT HELP THEM SET NEW POLICIES LIKE COMMUNITY SOLAR. TO CREATE NEW AVENUES FOR LOW INCOME RATES HAVE ACCESS TO THE BENEFIT OF SOLAR AT THE TO JUST HOP ON POP. THAT ALLOW HOMEOWNERS TO. SPEND A LOT OF MONEY UP FRONT WHICH LOWER INCOME FOLKS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA THEY DIDN'T GET THE BENEFIT THE CLEANER ENERGY. ACT HARD WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THE ADVANCED CONTRACT COOL AND PUSHING ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL. ALLIES FOR HIGHER TARGET. BUT WE HAVE BEEN THE- LASTING AS A WHAT THE TRANSIT TO CLEAN TRACK Q. IT WORKERS ARE NOT BEING. WHAT WE WHEN WE PUSH TO CLEAN. A THE THIRTY ABOUT THE POINT BOB ANGELES AND LONG BEACH WITH THAT I'M FOR. IN LARGE PART BECAUSE BETWEEN OF THAT TRACKS WITH BORN BY THE DRIVER THEMSELVES WHO ARE MISCLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. SIMILARLY A CARD. WHILE WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO PUSH FOR THAT WHICH TO BE OUR MISSION VIA COLD THANK THAT INCREASE- THE END THAT NUMBER OF TRUCKS. MANUFACTURED AND PUT ON THE ROAD WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS. ARE NOT BEARING THE COST. OF THAT TRANSITION AND WITHOUT THE KIND OF ANALYSIS. THAT HAD THAT SB CA NINETY FIVE WOULD CREATE. FOREIGN WE REALLY HAVE ALLEN CONSEQUENCES AROUND TRANS AND UNDER MY THE POP. FAITH IN. IN THE TRANSIT. WE'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT WE'RE NOT TAKING THE TIME TO DO THE RIGHT KIND OF ANALYSIS REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE IMPACT- OF THE TRANSITION ARE GOING TO BE ON THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THOSE WORKERS WHO ARE MARK STONE TEMPLE THAT WOULD VERY EXCITED TO THE POINT THAT FLIGHT PLACE. AND THAT BOB ANSWER ANY QUESTION THAT MEMBER MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY PERSON ONCE HAS FINES FOR THE BILL- BUT IF THERE'S ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES MODERATE WHO. WANTS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN NINETY FIVE- WHAT'S YOUR FOR THEM. HELLO THANK YOU MISS CHAIRMAN WITH NORMAL SPEECH FOR THIS OF FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE THE ZERO ON YOUR PHONE'S KEEP OUT THE SUN NUMBER WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER ONE MEMBERS CALLED SPEAKER NAME L. AFFILIATION PRIVILEGE SERVER. ONCE AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR COMMENT. IT IS ANYONE SPEAKING OPPOSITION- PLEASE PROCEED TO THE DIS- BUT MATTER ANYONE ANYONE TURNING UP ON THE PHONE LINES IN SUPPORT. NOBODY CAN REFER SUPPORT ANYONE COMING UP IN OPPOSITION I MEAN I'M NOT SURPRISES NO WE DON'T HAVE- EITHER SUPPORT OPPOSITION FILED FOR THE BILL BUT- ANYONE ANYONE OPPOSITION. THE ROLE OF PHONE SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION PRESS ONE ZERO. NINETY FIVE. OKAY LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE NOBODY CAN THANK YOU SO MUCH LET'S RESPECT THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS CENTER STERN. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND INSISTING ON- THE SPOTLIGHT HERE'S SENATOR AS I JUST I WANTED TO ASK YOU BRIEFLY- THE ANALYSIS. NOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS IN HERE. BUT I I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- WHAT'S WHAT'S RETAINED IN. THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S AN EXISTING SET OF LAWS I THINK IT'S UNDER SB SIX SEVENTEEN FROM BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT ANY RULE THAT'S GOT AN ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OVER FIFTY MILLION- HAS TO GO THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL A REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS- WHICH- WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF ITS ISN'T IN THE HOUSE AT LEAST IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT. THE HOW THE EFFECTS OF THE REGULATION ARE DISTRIBUTED. BY INDUSTRY INCOME RACE SEX OR GEOGRAPHY. SO FAR ALREADY SORT OF LOOKING AT THOSE EFFECTS IN THE SOCIO ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS REQUIRED UNDER EXISTING LAW. WHAT WHAT WHAT MORE DOES THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS GIVE US IS THIS TRYING TO SORT OF PIN THAT DOWN AND GET INTO. ACTUAL A JUDGE I JOBS IMPACT ANALYSIS OR- I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT IT'LL LOOK LIKE- IN PRACTICE IN ADDITION WHAT'S ALREADY GOING ON YEAH WELL THERE IS- AS I UNDERSTAND THERE'S NO MINIMUM REQUIREMENT ACROSS ALL AIR DISTRICTS. TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF SPECIFICALLY DURING THE- SOCIOECONOMIC ASSESSMENT SOME DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED BY AB US SIX SEVENTEEN OF TO WORK WITH- THEIR RESOURCES BOARD OF AN EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THERE'S SOME ERROR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE STAFF LOSE THEIR OWN OF POLICIES FOR ADDRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- THE- BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT ACROSS THE BOARD SO WE JUST WANT TO ESTABLISH THAT- THEY DO FOR MORE ON THAT FRONT THEN CARP DOES. SO I THINK THAT'S THE- WHAT WE WANNA- BALANCE OUT HERE AND MAKE SURE IT'S DONE ACROSS THE BOARD WITH THE STATE AND ALSO OUR THRESHOLD WOULD BE TEN MILLION. AHLERS NOT THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT ALL STATE AGENCIES ARE. AS I UNDERSTAND ARE REQUIRED TO DO. THANK YOU. THERMOS KEEP I GUESS I'M I HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS AS OUTLINED IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS ABOUT THE EXPANSIVENESS REQUIREMENTS HERE OF THE OF THE BILL'S QUITE LENGTHY AND THE ACHIEVABILITY OF CREATED I KNOW THAT WE HAVE OUR INITIAL AUDIT THE FIRST CITED THAT WE'VE GOT FROM THIS STATE OTHER ON SOME OF THE- DEFICIENCIES OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THE CARBS TO AND IT'S A NEW THING THAT WE'RE- WE'RE DOING. SO I DID STAFF REPORTS SUGGEST THAT WE REDUCE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF. ECO ECONOMETRIC ASSESSMENTS LISTEN SECTION TO SOME LOOKING AT SECTION TWO IS THAT. AS IT PICKS UP IN THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FOUR AND GOES IN THAT GOES FOR IS THAT THE WHOLE SECTION TWO THAT'S BEING DELETED. THE OTHER THAN THE OTHER THAN THE DEFINITIONS ON. TO BE ABLE TO BE TO SEE GOES THROUGH A LOT OF. OKAY ELEMENTS SECTION TO CHANGES ASIDE. HAVE HERE. OF THESE A SECTION TO CHANGES THESE ELEMENTS NOW APPLY ONLY TO CARB. PURCHASE A LOCAL DISTRICTS RIGHT RIGHT OKAY OKAY I GOTTA KEEP. IT STILL FITS STILL THE LEGAL THE LEGAL RISK IN THE ACHIEVABILITY STILL EXIST RIGHT YOU DO TAKING OUT THE LOCAL DISTRICTS TO GET THAT BUT HALF OF THE STATE WHY THEY STILL HAVE TO DO THAT ANALYSIS BY ANY REGULATION RIGHT. WELL THEY DO DO SOME RIGHT WE WANTED TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON BOTH ECONOMIC AND RACIAL WEALTH AND ESPECIALLY THE RACIAL BECAUSE THAT'S NOT EXPLICIT RIGHT NOW PLAYING THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE IT'S MUCH MORE PRESCRIPTIVE. YOU KNOW THEY'VE THERE THIS IS I THINK CAL I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER STATES THEY'RE DOING THIS FOR A SORT OF SOCIAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS ON THE REGULATIONS THAT FIT CALIFORNIA'S DOING SO WE'VE WE'VE DONE IT WE'VE GOT THE FIRST AUDIT THEY CAME IN AND SAID THAT WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB. THAN THIS IS TEN NINETY FIVE IS AN ANSWER I FEEL A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE TODAY. DURING THE BILL BECAUSE SEEMS. IT IT'S SO PRESCRIPTIVE OF WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THAT I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON ALL THE- ATIONS OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT VERSUS THE BENEFIT OF THE ON- I MEAN I THIS IS THE FIRST TRY THIS IS IF. THIS IS IF CALIFORNIA WAS EVER CUTTING THE EDGE ON IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL POLICY THIS THIS IS EMBRACED BY BY THIS BILL AND I GUESS IT'S I'D LIKE TO SEE IMPRINTED IS GOOD TO GO JUDICIARY SAMBA SEAT AGAIN- SO I'D LIKE TO I'M GONNA STAY OFF THE BILL TODAY- TO LOOK AT THE- CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL. CHANGES THAT THEY MAY BEFORE WE GET TO THE JUDICIARY AND WHAT YOU SAID THE COMMITTEE WITH ME YEAH WELL LOOK YOU'RE RIGHT HELLO I'M SO SORRY IT'S NOT GOING TO DO HERE I REALLY APOLOGIZE THE NEXT ONE THAT HERTZBERG BILL I WAS CONFUSED WITH. THIS ONCE IS GOING STRAIGHT TO A PROBES. UP MY SOLITARY CENTERVIEW SO. YEAH I. YEAH I GUESS EVEN TAKING OUT THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS IS ALRIGHT BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO STATE POLICY THAT IS GOING TO TWO VERY SPECIFIC ECONOMIC IT AND SOCIALIZE IT'S LIKE I'M READING THIS AND I'M THINKING WE NEED LIKE THEY'RE GONNA HIRE TEMA SIX PHD SIGNAL TO DETERMINE ALL THE ALL THE ECONOMIC AND- OF. BUZZ RACIAL IMPACTS IT MAY HAPPEN ON WHO'S WHO LOSE THEIR JOB WHO'S GONNA PUT NEIGHBORHOOD IT IS WHETHER THEY COULD BE LATINO OR BLACK OR PACIFIC ISLANDER AND ALL THAT IN IN FOR SOMEBODY OBVIOUSLY SPONSORS THAT'S VERY GOOD INFORMATION. I JUST DON'T I AM. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S DUPLICATE IT IF IT'S THE- THIS SINCE IT'S GOING WITH THIS VERSUS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN ORGANICALLY AT THE AIRPORT AND IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THE DEFICIENCIES ABOUT THE I GUESS THE DEFICIENCIES THAT THAT EXIST OTHER THAN WHICH POINTED OUT WITH THE- WITH THE AUDIT SO. THAT'S MY- THOUGHTS ON IT MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD YES YES PLEASE A QUICK OF RESPONSE TO THAT YOU'RE RIGHT CALIFORNIA'S IS A GREAT HEAD WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE DOING GOOD BUT WE HAVE NOT GIVEN THAT FOCUS ON THE ECONOMIC AND RACIAL. WHERE THEY COME TOGETHER AND SO THAT'S THE PART THAT WE NEED TO START PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO BECAUSE AS OUR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES MOVE FORWARD AS WE BEGIN TO DO MORE AND MORE ARE INVESTMENTS GROW WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THOSE COMMUNITIES SO NOW'S EXACTLY THE TIME WE STARTED TO DO SOME OF THAT. AMENITIES IT'S GOING TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER NOW'S THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T GET LEFT BEHIND. I MEAN I I'M THIS IS NOT A COLLOQUY MISTER CHAIR BUT BUT RIGHT NOW THE AIRORTS AND THE DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED. TO HAVE THEIR SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS THEY HAVE ON SOCIAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND HOW TO SUPPORT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IT'S THEIR THE AUTO REPORTS SAID THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THIS IS TEN NINETY FIVE WHICH- IS. SINCE THIS BASEBALL SEASON A DOUBLE GRAND SLAM OF WHAT THAT WOULD BE WHICH BABY YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE AUTHOR THAT'S OKAY THAT'S IT I'M I'M LOOKING AT IT AND SAYING. IN SAYING I NEED TO RE READ THIS AGAIN SO I'M JUST IT'S JUST SO. THE CHAIR UNDERSTANDS MY NO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS I MEAN HONESTLY I WOULD PARTICULARLY WHEN THE BILL IS FOR SURE AND I THINK I'M- IT WAS A QUADRUPLE GRAND SLAM IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW A BOOK BUT BUT BUT NOT ENOUGH NOT NATIONALLY POSITIVELY I MEAN I THINK OUR REAL CONCERN WAS IT WAS IT WAS. THE KIND OF UP AND DOWN IMPACTS IT WOULD HAVE ON. ON- ON THE ABILITY OF FAIR DISTRICTS TO DO THEIR WORK- I RECEIVED YOU KNOW WE'VE WORKED HARD TO. FIVE TO TEN. TO THE BELL BUT- AND OF COURSE THE AIR B. HAS A LOT MORE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO DO THIS SORT OF WORK THAT. IS OUT CALLED FOR THE BILL BUT AND- BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WRONG I THINK YOU'RE ON TO. SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES. WITH THIS BILL I AM CENTER CASKEY. SO OKAY- BUT YOU KNOW. I FEEL I FEEL I'M- MOVED BILL THE BILL OKAY THE BILL'S REMOVED- I CERTAINLY THINK WE'RE IT WE'RE IN A MUCH. STRONGER PLACE- BUT BUT THINK THE CLASSIC EARNED AS THE BILL MOVES FOR SENATORS GOING TO IS SUCH THAT WE YOU KNOW IT'S OUR JOB. TO LOOK OUT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL. AND AND I THINK THE CONCERN IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THERE AROUND THIS BILL IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE USED AS A TOOL TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR. OUR AIR DISTRICTS TO DO IT AND THEN THE AIRPORT TO DO ITS WORK IN KEEPING OUR CLEAN. I AND- YEAH THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT TIME HAS A HUGE SOCIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT AS WELL SO- WITHOUT AND WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY AND TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU AND- HI IT'S THE MOVE BY CENTER. SKINNER WILL COLLECT CLOSE. THANK YOU AND- I'M YOU KNOW EXCITES WAS RIGHT THERE YOU KNOW RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO MY DISTRICT EXCITED AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IMPACTED BY EXCITE LIVE IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT- AND THERE EXAMPLES LIKE THAT MAYBE NOT AS BIG AS DRAMATIC AND HISTORIC YOU KNOW ACROSS MY DISTRICT AND I WANT. CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER I WANT THAT FOR OUR COMMUNITY. BUT WE GOT TO TAKE IT ALL INTO ACCOUNT AND IGNORING FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION BUT ECONOMIC SIDE OF IT. IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MY COMMUNITY WE CAN'T DO THAT. CAN DO THAT TO THEM SO I BELIEVE WE'RE ALL CAPABLE OF DOING BOTH AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO JUST ADVANCE THAT. WE HAD FAR MORE AND WITH YOUR HELP WE WERE ABLE TO ZERO IN ON THE THINGS THEY WORK REALLY ESSENTIAL TO THIS BILL WE CUT OUT A LOT. OF A LOT MORE AND A LOT OF DETAIL SO FOR THAT AND- I'M GRATEFUL TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THE KALRA.

OFTEN REFERRED TO AS L. C. TOP TO SUPPORT FREE OR REDUCED FARE TRANSIT PROGRAMS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE APPLICATION L. C. TOP FUNDS IN THIS MANNER WILL PROVIDE FOR THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND BENEFITS OF FORWARD THINKING TRANSIT PROGRAMS SUCH AS FREE AND REDUCED FARE YOUTH RIDERSHIP BROKE. THAT EXPAND ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT AND CREATE LIFELONG TRANSIT RIDERS WHILE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS L. C. TOP WAS REGION CREATED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BY S. B. EIGHT SIXTY TWO IS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF PROGRAMS TARGETING GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. USING FUNDS GENERATED BY THE STATE'S GROUND BREAKING CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE A FULL INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL AND OPERATING PROJECTS. IN HIGH SPEED RAIL LC TOP IS TO MINISTER BY CALTRANS AND IS FUNDED THREE CONTINUES TO APPROPRIATION 5% GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS GENERATED BY CAP AND TRADE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND.SEVENTY FIVE MILLION- OVER OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MADE WAS LAID. FOR ALLOCATION TO OUT TO- TO LC TOP. AS NOTED ONE OF THE FOUNDATION GOALS WILL SEE TOP IS THE PROVISION OF OPERATING AND CAPITAL SYSTEMS TO TRANSIT AGENCIES. TO IMPROVE MOBILITY WHILE REDUCING GHGS WITH A PRIORITY ON SERVING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TODAY'S BILL BUILT ON S. B. ELEVEN NINETEEN PASSED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES. TO INVEST LC TOP FUNDS IN THREE AREAS PURSUANT TO MEETING THE OVERALL STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. OF PROVIDING A BENEFIT TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THOSE THREE AREAS WERE FIRST FUNDING TRANSIT FARE SUBSIDIES INCLUDING STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES. SECOND FUNDING TRANSIT CONNECTIONS TO MAJOR EMPLOYMENT AREAS EDUCATION CENTERS OR MEDICAL FACILITIES FOR RESIDENTS OF. OR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. FOUR FUNDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS THAT REDUCE EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF LC TOUGH FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF ZERO EMISSION BUSES IN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE. UNDER PROVISIONS OF SB ELEVEN NINETEEN A TRANSIT AGENCY CAN ONLY USE LC TOUGH FUNDS ONCE PER SIX MONTH PROGRAM INTERVAL MEETING THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REAPPLY IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER. AN APPROVED PROGRAM EVEN IF THE POPULATION SERVE HAS NOT CHANGED BECAUSE THE PROGRAM REQUIRES REGULAR RATE RIGOROUS EMISSION REDUCTION ANALYSIS AND OTHER REPORTING. THIS BILL WILL REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS WHILE ALLOWING FOR LONGER PERIODS OF APPROVAL THEREBY EXPANDING THE BENEFITS OF THE- OVER THE PAST DECADE ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC TRANSIT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. HAS TRIED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT FREE AND REDUCED TRANSIT FOR YOUR PROGRAMS. UNFORTUNATELY A LACK OF AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR MAINTAINING PROGRAMS ON A LONG TERM BASIS HAS STYMIED THOSE EFFORTS IN ORANGE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE. THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY HAS SUCCESSFULLY OPERATED AN LC TOP FUNDED YOU THROW YOU THROUGH FREE PROGRAM. ALLOWING YOUNG WRITERS AGES EIGHTEEN UNDER TO ACCESS ALL ORANGE COUNTY FIXED ROUTE BUSES AT NO COST THIS MONTH THIS SIX MONTH DEL SITO PILOT PROGRAM. BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH PASSES THAT WERE VALID THROUGH FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH OF THIS YEAR. SINCE THE PROGRAM'S INCEPTION THE NUMBER OF YOUTH WRITERS HAS INCREASED STEADILY FROM SEVENTH OUR FIVE EIGHTY. INSERT TWENTY ONE TO OVER TWELVE THOUSAND RIGHT IN THIS. OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THE PROGRAM IS SUCCEEDING IN ITS AIM OF CULTIVATING GENERATION OF NEW AND HOPEFULLY LIFELONG RIDERS. THIS PROMISING YOUTH RIDERSHIP PROGRAM IS ALSO PROVIDED A SECONDARY BENEFIT OF SUPPORTING ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN ORANGE COUNTY IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC. PARTICULAR MULLIN- SEES LOW INCOME AND DIVERSE POPULATIONS UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER WHILE THE INITIAL PIRATE PRO PILOT PROGRAM QUALIFY TO UTILIZE LC TOP FUNDING THE EXISTING STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS. NOTED EARLIER RENDER LC TOP AN UNSUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF ON GOING FUNDING YOU. OF THE INITIAL SUCCESS A LONG TERM PROSPECTS OF THE PROGRAM. AND PASSAGE OF S. NO FORTY TWO. CALIFORNIA AGENCIES WILL BE AUTHORIZED TO USE LC TOP MONIES FOR THE FUNDING OF FREE OR REDUCED RETURN PROGRAMS AND TO CONTINUE TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO MAINTAIN THOSE PROGRAMS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. PROVIDED THAT THE POPULATION OR OTHER ELEMENTS OF THIS PROGRAM HAVE NOT CHANGED IN SO DOING SB NINE FORTY TWO WILL PROVIDE MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS BENEFITS. REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES EXPAND MASS TRANSIT UTILIZATION BY LIFE LONG RUN. WITH CONGESTION OUR STREETS YEAH OFFERING AN AVENUE U. IMPROVEMENT OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AND- BY THE WITH ME TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING. ARE MOIRA TOP. MY LIKE TO REFER TO IS MORE L. TOP REPRISING MY JOKE EVERY FOUR YEARS.

PROGRAM WHERE A CTA PARTNER WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO PROVIDE HEAVILY DISICK DISCOUNTED FARE PASSES TO STUDENTS. AND MOST RECENTLY WE HAVE USED L. C. TOP FUNDS TO FUND OUR YOUTH RIGHT FREE% PROGRAM ALLOWING THOSE EIGHTEEN IN A AND UNDER TO RIDE AFFECTS FIXED ROUTE BUSES FOR FREE. THE YOUTH RIDE FREE PRO IS A KEY PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO IMPROVE MOBILITY OPTIONS. REDUCE CONGESTION AND CUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IN ADDITION PROGRAMS SUCH AS THESE WILL HELP BRING RIDERSHIP LEVELS BACK TO THOSE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. IN VOTING TO CONTINUE THIS THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THE- CTA BOARD OF DIRECTORS NOTED THE L. C. T. L. C. L. C. TOP FUNDS ARE VITAL TO ITS CONTINUATION. UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE USE OF L. C. TOP FUNDS LONG TERM REGARDLESS OF THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. SB NINE FORTY TWO WILL CLARIFY THAT ONGOING USE OF L. C. TOP FUNDS FOR FREE AND REDUCED FARE PROGRAMS IS AUTHORIZED. AGENCIES WILL STILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT METRICS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR PAST PROGRAMS AND DEMONSTRATE CONSISTENCY WITH L. C. TOP STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS IN THE INITIAL ALLOCATION ACROSS.

JOURNALIST OKAY LET'S GO TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE BILL CENTER BATES. ARE I SUPPORTED THE AD IN. I THINK- I INTEND TO DO THAT TODAY BUT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE FARE BOX RETURN RATIO IN IS THE ARE THE FUNDS THAT COME THROUGH THIS ON TO THE SUPPLEMENT THAT. WILL THAT WERE NOT AFFECTED ON THAT FROM ALL THE OTHER FEDERAL FUNDS THAT COME TO OUR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCIES I DON'T KNOW IF I'M ON THE RIGHT PAGE WITHOUT BUT I JUST WAS THINKING. THAT WHEN THESE PEOPLE ARE WRITING FREE BUT THEIR THEIR FARES ARE BEING SUPPLEMENTED WITH THIS. ITEM I BELIEVE SO THAT'S CORRECT A LET MR HIM UNTIL SHE COULD SPEAK TO. IS ON THE LINE. THIS QUESTION YEAH WHICH IS DID NOT YOU. SENATOR BATES THAT YES THE MY PROVIDE BY THE C. POSSIBLE OFFSET- RIGHT LAW- BOX BELOW AGENCIES COMPUTED- BOXER REQUIREMENT THAT SPECIFY IN STATE THANK. OKAY BUZZARD. SO I OFF THIS INTERNET AND THEN I'M I'M A FOR. YOU'RE GIVEN SOME A FAIR PASS BUT IN THE BILL IF YOU GO TO- ACTUAL PAY A LINE SEVEN. THE MONEY'S OF FOR THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO PROVIDE TRANSIT OPERATION CAPITAL ASSISTANCE THAT MEET ANY OF THE FOLLOWING. EXPENDITURES THAT DIRECTLY ENHANCE OR EXPAND TRANSIT SERVICES BY SUPPORTING NEW AND EXPANDED BUS OR RAIL SERVICES. NEW EXPANDED WATER BORNE TRANSIT OR EXPANDING INTERMODAL TRANSIT. TRANSIT FACILITIES AND MAKING INCLUDING EQUIPMENT ACQUISITION FUELING AND MAINTENANCE AND OTHER COSTS OPERATING THE SERVICES FACILITIES AND IT GOES ON THE LIST. A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN JUST OFFSETTING THE FARES FOR. FOLKS TO RIDE THE SO THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE. AND WE'RE GONNA SO I JUST KINDA WANT TO GET YOUR IDEA OF. OF THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A FAREBOX. SUPPLEMENT RESTAURANT ALLOWED MR OF SPEAK OF THIS PROJECT I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS TRULY CHANGES THE EXISTING PROVISIONS. GO AHEAD MR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER DOLLY- SO THAT'S CURRENT LAW SO THE BILL DOES PROVIDE FOR ALL OF THOSE ALTERNATIVES- FOR EXPENDITURE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THIS BILL IS- SIMPLY FOR THE FOR A FAIR REDUCE THEIR PROGRAM. YOU CAN HAVE A LONGER TERM OR A LONGER TIME FRAME TO- TO EXPAND THE MONEY IN THE PROGRAM YOU CAN THAT LET HAVE A PROGRAM LAST LONGER SO FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A TIME LIMITED- REQUIREMENTS. BUT FOR A OPERATIONAL PROGRAM BECAUSE THE STOCK THIS OP PROGRAM ALLOWS FOR BOTH CAPITAL AND OPERATIONS EXPENDITURES IT MAKES SENSE TO CONTINUE A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S SIMPLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. SO THIS IS A TWO THIRDS HE IS A TWO THIRDS VOTE SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN INCREASE. IN A NEED TO TWO THIRDS VOTE TO GET AT THE PAST AND SO WHAT HOW HOW LONG WILL THIS GO WELL THERE IS THERE SUNSET ON THIS BILL. AND SHOW. MISTRUST MY UNDERSTANDING YOU CAN.

OKAY I WOULD MOVE THE BILL THUNDERSTORMS MOVE THE BILL SENYUMANNYA MAKE CLOTHES YEAH I RESPECTFULLY ASK AND I WILL THANK YOU THIRTY OF HIS CAR. I AM NUMBER FIVE SB NINE FORTY TWO BY SENATOR NEWMAN. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALAN AYE ALLEN AYE BATES. AYE BATES FIVE DALLY. L. A. NOT VOTING ENDS ON. SKINNER STERN ALL RIGHT STERN I WHITE HOUSE BY CAST I. THAT'S FOR VOTERS AS AN EFFORT TO GET A BELIEVER ROLLED IN FROM THE NUMBERS AND ON THE CENTER ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE CENTER EGGMAN. AYE YOU MAY PROCEED. WITH YOUR PRESENTATION OF SB TEN FORTY SIX WHEN READY MEMBERS IS ITEM SIX IN YOUR PACKETS. CAN MEET MYSELF ABOUT LIKE SOME OF YOU I SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT BEFORE I CAME TO THE CAPITAL AND- DURING MY TIME IN THE CITY COUNCIL I REALLY. BECAME VERY INTERESTED AND PASSIONATE ABOUT THE IDEA OF WASTE AND WASTE REDUCTION. I REALLY THINK IT'S THE UNDERBELLY OF OUR OF OUR WORLD ECONOMY AND IF WE DON'T REALLY ADDRESS IT. THAT WE ALL HAVE ISSUES SO- IT IS NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS BUT- A WASTE AND WHAT WE DO WITH THAT I THINK. WILL HAVE LONG LASTING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HEALTH. SB TEN FORTY SIX IS A BAG. THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OF FROM DISTRIBUTING PRE CHECK OUT PRUDE PRODUCE BAGS THAT ARE NOT REUSABLE RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN FOLKS THOSE BAGS THAT YOU TAKE THAT YOU TRIED TO GET OPEN TO PUT YOUR VEGETABLES IN- NOW. WHERE BHASKER DON'T BUT THEY WERE VERY DIFFICULT. TO MAKE DOES COMPOSTABLE BUT WE KNOW NOW FROM. OUR PREVIOUS BILLS IN TRENTON IMPLEMENT- THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE ARE DIVERGING GOALS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY- CUT DOWN. ON WHAT WE PUT INTO THE TRASH AND PUT MORE INTO THE COMPOSTABLE GREEN WASTE. AT SO IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOU GET SOME GROCERIES AND IF YOU PUT HIM IN THE GREEN WASTE. IN YOUR LITTLE BAG. IF THAT STARTS TO GO TOO SOON AND YOU TO THROW THAT IN THE TRASH NOW GONNA HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF THERE. TRY TO GET ALL THE GREEN OUT OF THERE. THEN PUT THAT IN THE GREEN WASTE AND PUT THAT BAG. IN THE TRASH. AT THAT COST MORE FOR THE HOLDERS TO TRY TO. GET THOSE TWO APART- SO THIS IS VERY SIMPLE I THINK THAT WE NOW. AND IS YOUR- THERE IS NO DATE FOR IMPLEMENTATION WERE WORKING WITH THE GROCER. WE'RE VERY THANKFUL FOR THEM TO BE ABLE SEE WHAT IS REASONABLE- TO BE ABLE TO EFFORT TO THIS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. SO THAT WOULD BE YOUR MEAT BAGS PRODUCE BAGS THOSE BY THAT YOU GET WE'VE ALREADY. THAT WE CAN PLASTIC BY AT THE CHECKOUT MISTER PAY MORE FOR IT THE SAME KIND OF LIKE THINKING. BUT THIS WOULD BE FOR THOSE BAGS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPOSED BILL. ALSO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I ALSO HAVE DOGS AND USE THOSE BAGS LATER. FOR SAID DOG WALKING- WE WANT THAT THING TO BE COMPOSTABLE WE DON'T WANT TO PUT IT IN A BAG AND- IT FOR. OUR GRAND TO FIND LATER ON- SO WITH ME TODAY I HAVE NICKEL CREAM FROM THE CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE WHO ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND I WOULD INVITE HER FORWARD WENT. THE COMMITTEE DEEMS IT. HER TIME. NO COMEDIANS A TIME. THANK YOU AND PERCY. THANK YOU THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS- AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE CALIFORNIA HAS A MAJOR PLASTICS PROBLEM. WHILE PLASTICS ARE MULTI FACETED ISSUE THAT WILL REQUIRE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS. PLASTIC PRODUCE BAGS POSE A UNIQUE CHALLENGE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AS MORE RESIDENTS GET COMPOSTING SERVICE MORE AND MORE OF THE PLASTIC PRODUCE BAGS WE USE FOR FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. AND OF THE COMPOST WASTE STREAMS CONTAINING MUNICIPAL COFFERS. BILLS FACILITIES. OBLONG NOT ONLY INCREASE MICHAEL. IN COMPO HANDLING. AND HIGHER RATES WORKING- AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE COMPOSTING REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN SB THIRTY THREE IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE WORK TO ENSURE OUR WAY STREAMS ARE AS CLEAN AND UNCONTAMINATED AS POSSIBLE. THE AVERAGE WORKING LIVE A PLASTIC BAG IS FIFTEEN MINUTES AND OVER A HUNDRED TRILLION PLASTIC BAGS ARE USED WORLDWIDE EACH YEAR. AS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE CLASSICALLY ARE JOKES BIRDS TURTLES AND OTHER SENSITIVE MARINE SPECIES AND PERSIST IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND DEFINITELY. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CONTAMINATION AND COMPOST WASTE STREAMS DECREASES WHEN CONSUMERS HAVE CONVENIENT ACCESS TO COMPOSTABLE BAGS. IN A TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOOD WASTE COLLECTION TRIAL IN NEW YORK CITY COMPOSTABLE BAGS WERE FOUND TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR REDUCING COMPOSTING CONTAMINATION. AND THE TRIAL ALSO FOUND THAT CONSUMERS WERE ABLE TO MORE SUCCESSFULLY COLLECT AND IMPLEMENT ORGANIC WASTE BECAUSE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF ALREADY HAVING ACCOMPLISHED BACK ON HAND. SO CALIFORNIA'S PLASTIC BAG BAN PROVIDED A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD IN REMOVING SINGLE USE PLASTIC BAGS WERE AWAY STREAMS. REPLACING SOURCES OF FILM PLASTIC POLLUTION CAN BE DONE COST EFFECTIVELY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SUPPORTING THE STATE'S ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING GOALS. WE CAN DO THIS BY TRANSITIONING TO ALTERNATIVE. M. S. B. TEN FORTY SIX WHAT PER PROHIBIT THE DISTRIBUTION OF PLASTIC PRE CHECK OUT PRODUCE BAGS UNLESS THEY'RE REUSABLE RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE. AND THIS BILL PROVIDES CALIFORNIA WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP WHICH WILL BE TO REMOVE SINGLE USE PLASTIC PRODUCE BAGS FROM OUR WASTE STREAM. THANK YOU.

WE WILL HAVE YES ALI IT'S IN THE BOOK BILLS A MOVE BY CENTER WOOD COUNTY. SO- IS THAT THE COMPOSTABLE BAGS- SO I KNOW I GET PAPER BAGS COMPOSTABLE BUT A PLOT OF SOME THIRTEEN IS NOT PAPER- AND YOU WANTED TO BE COMPOSED DOUBLE THAT DOES IT ALLOW FOR THE TRANSFER OF SO SAY I HAD- MEAT PRODUCT AND I HAD A LEAFY LETTUCE PRODUCT AND THEY WORK IN MY BACK TOGETHER AND I DON'T WANT TO GET THE- I DON'T CROSS CONTAMINATION WHAT IS THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE WHAT KIND OF A PRODUCT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING. DID YOU MEET DOESN'T TOUCH YOUR YES LET US SEE SO YES OF THE STORE I'M TRYING TO I KNOW THAT YOU CAN USE PAPER AS COMBUST AS A RIGHT. THERE IN THE SAME BAGHEL TOUCH NO NO I'M SAYING IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SEPARATE SO RIGHT NOW IT'S PACKAGED IN PLASTIC. AND BOTH OF PLASTIC SO WHAT WHAT THAT LOOK LIKE- I WILL ASK MY EXPERT WITNESS MY UNDERSTANDING IS I MEAN WE ALREADY USE THOSE BAGS SO IT WOULD KEEP THOSE THINGS APART BECAUSE LIKE TRADER JOE'S THERE ARE YOU'RE ALREADY COMPANIES TO MAKE THESE BAGS YOU'LL SEE IN THERE KIND OF A GREENISH COLOR. AND WASHINGTON HAS PASSED A LAW THAT SAYS THEY HAVE TO BE GREEN SO PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHICH ARE WHICH ABOUT MY UNDERSTANDING IT IS IT WILL KEEP IT APART MAYBE NOT FOR LONG TERM- BUT AS LONG AS THE BAG WOULD ASK I WOULD ASK ME WITNESSES SHE HAS ANYTHING FURTHER TO ADD. BUT THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE OF THE TYPE OF BAGS AND THERE ARE TWO. COMPANIES TO MAKE THEM THEIR RESIDENT FOR THESE TYPE OF BAGS THAT THAT IS ALREADY DEVELOPED AND ESTABLISHED AND THAT COMPANY HAS SAID THEY'RE READY TO GIVE UP MORE BUT YOU GOT MORE DEFINITIVE OF MISTER KELLY'S MEETING HER ACT YEAH- SO THERE ARE COMPOSTABLE. PRODUCE BAGS THAT RESEMBLE THE CURRENT PLASTIC PRODUCE BAGS THAT ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW- BUT THAT YEAH THERE'S TWO COMPANIES THAT MAKE THE RESIN NOBLE MIND B. A. S. F. AND THE OTHER COMPANIES USE THAT RISING TO MAKE THOSE BAGS- AND THEY'RE THEY'RE AVAILABLE IN LIKE TRADER JOE'S- AND SO THOSE THOSE BAGS HAVE TO MEET COMPOSED ABILITY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE BILL- AND THOSE COMPOSED ABILITY REQUIREMENTS WERE PASSED ON LAST YEAR AND AB TWELVE ALL ONE- BY SOME MEMBERS HANG. AND THOSE COMPOSED ABILITY ARE REQUIREMENTS JUST TO MAYBE ELABORATE A BIT. OUR MEETING THE A. S. C. OF KERR. ABILITY THIRD PARTY SERVICE. NOT CONTAINING P. FOSTER AND THEY HAVE TO BE DISTINGUISHABLE AS A COMPOSTABLE PRODUCT WHICH INCLUDES LIKE GREEN LABELING AND SUCH. K. MY LAST I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BUT DO YOU. THERE IN ALICE'S ON WHAT THE COST TO CONSUMER WOULD BE- IN THE FUTURE. THE MY UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE THIS IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND- COMPANIES ARE USING IT- THERE SHOULDN'T BE A HUGE THE COST BECAUSE IT'S NOT MESSED UP NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DEVELOP TO USE IT SORRY SOMETHING IN USED IN PRODUCTION. OF COURSE THE MORE PEOPLE USE OF IT THE- LESS EXPENSIVE IT IS TO MAKE. OKAY HI MEAT AND THE VEGETABLES ARE GONNA DECOMPOSE WAY FASTER THAN THE- AG- RIGHT YEAH OKAY- THE ITEM HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER CASKEY SOME OF YOU MAY CLOSE I WOULD JUST ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I THINK IN THIS COMMONSENSE BILL TO TAKE US A STEP FURTHER REDUCING THE PLASTIC IN OUR WASTE STREAM AND REDUCING THE COSTS FOR FOLKS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY AS MUCH TO GET IT ALL THE WAY BECAUSE THE STREAM WILL BE CLEAN. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT AS A GROUP ROLE ITEM NUMBER SIX SB TEN FORTY SIX BY SENATOR EGGMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS ALAN I. ALLEN HI BATES. IT'S NOT VOTING DALLY. DALLY NOT VOTING GONZALEZ SKINNER STERN AYE CASKEY HI HI. OKAY WILL EITHER OPEN FROM THIRTY ARTS AND ARCHULETA AS HERE AS AN ARCHER ACTUALLY HAS TWO BILLS TO PRESENT HIS WITH SB TWO SEVENTY SIX. I AM SO YOU'RE A PACKETS MEMBERS. AND WILL BEGIN WITH TENTS SIX THIS. THAT THAT'S GREAT IF OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE TIME TODAY. I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH WILL HARMONIZE STATE AND FEDERAL TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND REGARD SHOULD LEAD BASED LOOK AT LEAD PAINT- AND RELATED WORK. TOTAL BRINGING IT TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TOGETHER- AND WHICH IS IT DESPERATELY NEEDED CURRENT LAW REQUIRES CONTRACTORS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO DO WORK THAT MIGHT DISRUPT LEAD PAINT. TO BE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE LEVELS. THIS HAS LED TO LOTS OF CONFUSION IN THE INDUSTRY. TO ADDRESS THIS CONFUSION SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ADOPT AND UPDATE THEIR TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS TO REFLECT THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. IN PRACTICE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW CONTRACTORS AND INDIVIDUALS TO BE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED ONCE. INSTEAD OF CURRENT PRACTICE WHICH REQUIRES A SEPARATE TRAINING FOR BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL. ALTHOUGH LEAD PAINT AS BEEN BANNED IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES LEAD POISONING FROM EXPOSURE TO LEAD PAINT CONTINUES TO PLAGUE THE STATE. IN FACT AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS OFFICE ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT 60% OF HOUSES IN CALIFORNIA WERE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND ARE PRESUMED TO HAVE LEAD BASED PAINT. THE EXPOSURE TO LEAD AT ANY LEVEL CAN HAVE SERIOUS NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE. HOWEVER LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN IS A PARTICULAR AREA OF CONCERN EVEN A SLIGHT ELEVATION OF IN BLOOD LEVELED- IN A CHILD CAN REDUCE IQ CAUSE BRAIN OR NERVE DAMAGE AND EVEN STUNT IN CHILD GROWTH. EXPOSURE TO LEAD IS COMMON AMONG AND DURING RENOVATION AND RECONSTRUCTION. UNTRAINED INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT FOLLOW PROPER PROTOCOLS CAN UNKNOWINGLY CHIPPED PAINT LEAD BASED PAINT IT TWO YARDS OR SEND UP CLOUDS OF LEAD PAINT DUST ARE CAUSING THE PROBLEMS TO THE NEIGHBORS AND SURROUNDING AREAS INDIVIDUALS WORKING WITH LEAD PAINT POSE A HAZARD NOT JUST TO THEMSELVES BUT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY SIX ADDRESSES THIS LEAD ISSUE BY STREAMLINING AND HARMONIZING OUR TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION PROCESS AND AT THE SAME TIME STRAIGHT IN OUR OVERSIGHT BY EMPOWERING LOCAL TO HANDLE THIS ISSUE. IN ADDITION THIS BILL REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. TO COLLABORATE AND IMPLEMENT AN EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO INFORM INDIVIDUALS OF THE HARMS OF LEAD AND THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED. THE OUTREACH PROGRAM WILL RUN FOR ONE YEAR BEFORE CRTIFICATION AND TRAINED A REQUIREMENTS WILL BE FORCED AND ENFORCE. GIVE EXAMPLE GIVING EVERYONE AMPLE TIME RATHER TO COMPLY FOURTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY STREAMLINED THEIR REGULATIONS TO HARMONIZE BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL I RECEIVED NO OPPOSITION AND IS SUPPORTED BY A NUMBER OF HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY AFTER I VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE SUSAN LITTLE OF REPRESENTING THE BUYER METAL WORKING GROUP. ON THE PHONE IS- LARRY BROOKS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THANK YOU MAY PROCEEDMAY THANK. BYE AND BYE THE WAY PLAY- I- WRIST ASK FOR YOUR VOTE YES I WOULD. HAVE EXPECTED OKAY SO LET'S GO WITH THIS WITH YOU MISLED. IT'S A LITTLE I'M WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF SB TEN SEVENTY SIX. AND AS THE SENATOR HAD EXPLAINED HAS EXPLAINED- AND AS YOU ALL KNOW LEAD IS HARMFUL TO CHILDREN AND ADULTS. BUT YOUNG CHILDREN ARE THE MOST SENSITIVE TO THE EFFECTS OF LEAD AND IN FACT. A CHILD'S EXPOSURE TO EVEN MINUTE AMOUNTS OF LEAD CAN HARM THEIR BRAIN. AND THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM AS IT DEVELOPS. LOW LEVELS OF LEAD EXPOSURE CAN CAUSE CHILDHOOD BEHAVIORAL AND LEARNING PROBLEMS THAT LAST WELL INTO ADULTHOOD. AND WE KNOW NOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY THIS DAMAGE THAT LED DOES IS A REVERSIBLE IT IS A LOT IT IS A LIFE LONG. CHALLENGE THAT THEY WILL HAVE. BECAUSE OF THIS THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL HAD DETERMINED THERE'S NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD. AND HEARING CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY THIS TO STATISTICS INDICATE. THAT LOW INCOME CHILDREN OUR LEAD POISONED MORE OFTEN THAN CHILDREN FROM HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES. 88% THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH INDICATE SAYS THAT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIA'S LEAD POISONED CHILDREN ARE ON MEDICAID. ON AN THIS IN ANY DISTRIBUTION ISN'T. BECAUSE LOW INCOME CHILDREN OF COURSE ARE. LIVE ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE AN OLDER HOUSING.

IT WHAT ARE YOUR WHAT. SPOKE YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE. THIS AND THEY'RE NOT. TO BE ABLE DO. SO THESE LICENSE CONTRACTORS OR THESE. UNLICENSED CONTRACT THAT'S WHO I. WAS THERE ANY DATA ON WHO'S DOING THE WHO BECAUSE OF THEIR UNLICENSED. OR IT'S A HOMEOWNER THIS ACTUALLY JUST REPAINTING THEIR HOUSE AND DON'T KNOW- THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A RISK. SO IS THERE ANY DATA THAT'S BEEN GATHERED ON. ON WHO'S ACTUALLY DOING THESE THE WORK. THAT WE TURN THAT OVER TO THE EXPERT. FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS ACTUALLY THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER. WOULD APPLY TO SOMEONE WHO IS HIRED TO DO THE WORK. SO WE KNOW THAT- I'M ACTUALLY REFER TO DEFER TO LARRY BROOKS WAS ON THE CALL BECAUSE HE IS. WITH THE CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SOMEONE KNOW THE STATISTICS ON THIS BUT- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A LARGE PART OF THE PROBLEM COMES FROM UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS. AND OFTEN TIMES THESE ARE FOLKS WERE OUT WE'RE GETTING THE LICENSE CONTRACTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE- NOT. PERFORMING THE LEAD SAFE WORK AND ARE ABLE TO CUT UNDERCUT UNDERCUT THE- BETTER ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY AND SO. WE DO HAVE A IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUPPORT OFFICE THE SUPPORT LIST. WE DO HAVE THEM INFORM CONTRACTOR SINCE. ALL RIGHT WHY I KNOW THAT SO THIS IS THAT. THE A CLASSIC CASE OF. THE PERSON THAT'S DOING IT RIGHT IS GETTING PENALIZED AGAIN TO GO TO CLASS AGAIN AND THE PERSON IS NOT DOING IT RIGHT. WHO IS IT PUTTING. THEIR FAMILY AND OTHER PEOPLE AT RISK IS THERE'S AND THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME WAY TO GO OUT TO THE UNLICENSED PERSON WHO IS. THAT WHAT WE'RE REGULATING THE LOOK THE LICENSE PERSONS AGAIN. AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN MY- YOU KNOW FRUSTRATION AS ALLEGED. WHERE WE GO AFTER WE CAN TO ADD MORE- TO THE PERSON ALREADY. THAT IT'S THIS A THAT WE WERE DO IT AND A ON SAFE. SO SOME AND IF THE LAW LEVEL RIGHT I SERVED FOR SIX YEARS- THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE THE PLAYS WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THAT RE. TO BE TO GO OUT. AND THAT GO OUT THE BAD. WHO ARE UNDERCUTTING THE LEGITIMATE CONT WHOSE. THE LAW INSTEAD OF MAKING MORE LAWS TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE LICENSE CONTRACTOR EVEN BID AGAIN SO THAT'S WHY I SWITCH FROM TRENT REYES. WHO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY BREAKING THE LAW ALREADY RIGHT NOW YOU NEED TO HAVE YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF WE HAVE PLENTY LAWS ON THE BOOKS. TO FOUR REGULATED OF LEAD DISPOSAL PAINT. BEEN AROUND FOR A SOME TIME AND WE'VE DISCUSSED THESE THINGS IN THIS COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST. YOU KNOW FIVE OR SIX YEARS AND WHEN I WAS IN THE SAME WAY WE DID A LOT OF WORK ON LAND. IN THE END OF. CAME OUT OF THE ACTS SIX. THAT WE SAW IN THE- THAT DIRECTLY IN. BY LEAD BASED NOT ONLY GOOD TEN. FROM SMELTING ALSO LEAD BASED PAINT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO I'M- A SOMEWHAT- HESITANT TO. REGULATE SOMEBODY WHO'S ALREADY REGULATE I WANT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GO AFTER THAT UNREGULATED PEOPLE WHO REALLY THE PROBLEM THEY'RE THEY'RE UNDER VETTING THESE LICENSE CONTRACTORS. AND THE HOMEOWNER DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE JUST WANTED TO GET THEIR HOME. REPAINTED OR OR THE PAINT REMOVED AND SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME ABILITY TO. GO AFTER THE BAD ACTORS AND QUIT- MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN LICENSE ALREADY- TO MEET THE LAW YEAH IT'S SENATOR IF I MAY. REMEMBER I HAD JUST MENTIONED WE HAVE THE FEDERAL LAW THAT'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND WE HAVE THE STATE LAW ALL THE GOING TO DO JUST JOIN TOGETHER SO ALL THESE- INSPECTORS CAN GO OUT AND GET ONE CERTIFICATION WHICH JOINS US TOGETHER FEDERAL AND STATE.

SKINNER I STERN I CAN LIFELIKE I'D- OKAY WE HAVE FIVE VOTES WILL THE ROLE OPEN FOR YOU I THINK TO GET MY VOTES IS OTHER MEMBERS BACK- BUT YOU GO AHEAD AND- AND ALSO PRESENT YOUR NEXT BILL TO THE SENATE SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THE CHAIRMAN OF TODAY AND PRESENTING SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK. YOUS AND- TO BEGIN TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE AND ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WE THINK THE CHAIR- AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ADD TO MAKE THIS BILL WHERE IT IS TODAY AND I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- AS AMENDED SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR WILL ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF MANGANESE IN CALIFORNIA'S WATER SYSTEMS THE CENTRAL BASIN REGION. IS IN MY OWN DISTRICT AND HAS HAD CHRONIC ISSUES WITH OUR WATER AND PACIFIC LEAD MAGNETS WHICH IS WHY I FELT THE NEED. TO AUTHORED THIS PARTICULAR BILL. MATT MATERIAL. FOUND NATURALLY IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST ABUNDANT METALS AND THE EARTH'S SURFACE THAT IS FOUND IN THE AIR. WATER AND SOIL AND COULD BE FOUND IN BOTH GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER FROM NATURAL SOURCES OR BECAUSE OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS MINING OR INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGERS. BALCONIES IS IN WATER CAN CAUSE. AS THE STATIC ISSUES SUCH AS- METALLIC TASTING OF THE WATER. METALLIC TASTING OF WATER. AND BLACK STAINS ON TUBS SHOWERS TOILETS PLUMBING FIXTURES AND LAUNDRY. THAT IS HAVE ALSO. IN THE SOCHI ATION BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO MANGANESE IN DRINKING WATER AND NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES IT INFANTS AND CHILDREN THIS INCLUDES CHANGING OF BEHAVIOR LOWERED OUR Q. S. SPEECH IMPEDIMENTS OF MEMORY LEFT DIFFICULTIES AND LACK OF COORDINATION. AND MOVEMENT CONTROL. AND IT'S THOUGHT THAT BAG IN THESE AS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND ELDERLY AND PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM LEVEL- LIVER DISEASE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IN TWENTY TWELVE CALIFORNIA BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO LEGISLATIVELY RECOGNIZE THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. IN THE WATER CODE THE STATE'S STATUTORILY RECOGNIZES THAT EVERY HUMAN. EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS THE RIGHT TO SAFE CLEAN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE WATER ADEQUATE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. COOKING AND SANITARY PURPOSES WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES TODAY AND SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR. WITH THAT BEING SAID SENATE ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR AS AMENDED AND AS AMENDED REPRESENTS A RESPONSIBLE AND THOUGHTFUL SOLUTION TO HELP BOTH THE CENTRAL BASIN REGION AND CALIFORNIA AT LARGE TO ACHIEVE OUR WATER GOALS. SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR FIRST REQUIRES THE OFFICE TO PROVIDE. HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT TO PREPARE A PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL FOR MAGGIE'S BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WHAT'S THAT PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR REQUIRES THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ADAPT A PRIMARY DRINKING WATER STANDARD FOR MANGANESE AND ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE MONITORING REQUIREMENTS IN BOTH SOURCE WATER AND THE DISTRIBUTE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH A PRIMARY DRINKING STANDARD FOR MACINNES BECAUSE MAGGIE NEEDS ITS SOUL SOUL- COCCYX CONCEPTUALIZES BECAUSE A PRIMARY DRINKING STANDARDS OR ENFORCEABLE- HEALTH- ISSUES. HOWEVER SECONDARY STANDARDS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE GUIDELINES. REGULATING COSMETIC OR AESTHETIC EFFECTS MACINNES IS CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED AS A SECONDARY STANDARD MAKING. THIS BILL NECESSARY. DURING THIS PERIOD ADD THE OF PRIOR TO ADOPTION THE PRIMARY DRINKING WATER STANDARD FOR BAGGIES SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR WE'RE DIRECT THE STATE WATER BOARD TO CONSIDER ESTABLISHING NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSE LEVEL FOR MAGNITUDE SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR ALSO AUTHORIZES THE WATER BOARD TO REQUIRED COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. TO MONITOR FOR BAG INDIES IN THEIR SOURCE WATER WITHIN THEIR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AS WELL AS AUTHORIZED THEM TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR TREATMENT AND SOURCE PROTECTION. FINALLY SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF EXCEEDING THE SECONDARY STANDARD FOR MAGNETS IN THE SOURCE WATER OR WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OF A COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEM AS A BASIS FOR FUNDING PRIORITIZE ATION. AS OF. SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR WOULD DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THE WATER AND THE CENTRAL BASIN REGION AS WELL AS HELPING BRING THE FUNDING FOR THE REGION WHERE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR STARTED AS A THIRD DISTRICT BILL BUT NOW IS INVOLVED IN TO BECOME A GREAT STEP FORWARD TO ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE ABLE TO TRUST THAT WATER. DOES NOT CONTAIN DANGEROUS LEVELS OF MANGANESE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE THIS IMPORTANT BILL DARROW LUCIENNE. ON BEHALF OF THE CENTRAL BASIN WATER DISTRICT WHICH REPRESENTS OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE I RESPECT GAS ROUTE RESPECT AFTER AYE VOTE. WE'LL GO TO DINNER I ALSO HAVE THAT DANIEL BLESSED HANDS HERE IS.

DELIVER WATER TO- ALL THE HOUSEHOLDS IN OUR REGION RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH TARA. OKAY I. UNDERSTAND THAT THE DETAILS CAN BE RAISING SOME.

OKAY LET'S GO LET'S HEAR FROM THEM I HAVE NO AND YET OKAY THANK YOU. FIVE TO SAY IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN PERSON NICE TO SEE ONCE ACES- GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DANIEL BLESSED HAD WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. ARE FIFTY FIVE PUBLIC WATERAGENCY MEMBERS SERVE RETAIL OR WHOLESALE WATER UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT VERSION A HAVE SB ELEVEN NINE OR ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR. BUT I REALIZE THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I WON'T GO THROUGH WHAT OUR CONCERNS ARE WITH THE VERSION AND FRANK AS I KNOW IT'S GOING TO CHANGE. BUT I DID WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH A SAFE AND RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY AND THEY ALSO CONSISTENTLY LOOK FOR WAYS TO ADVANCE ACCESS TO SAFE AND RELIABLE SUPPLY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. INCLUDING THOSE IN THE CENTRAL BASIN REGION AHEAD IN FACT I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT ANOTHER BILL THE MOVES THE NEEDLE FORWARD ON THAT ISSUE- WE HAVE NOT TAKEN. THE NEW LANGUAGE TO OUR COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION YET SO SENIOR IT IS NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION WE APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANT WORK AT THAT I KNOW HAS GONE INTO- READING THE- AMENDMENTS BY. COMMITTEE ALSO THE AUTHOR CYPRUS THAT WE DO EXPECT TO HAVE CONCERNS ON THE NEW LANGUAGE WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE. AND ALSO THE AUTHOR TO TRY AND ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND I'M- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MANGANESE. LEAVE A LEAVE THAT- TO THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VIRGINIA AND I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I KNOW YOU'RE- FEELING MUCH BETTER ABOUT IT THAN YOU WERE BEFORE MAY I KNOW YOU THERE'S ALSO SOME CONCERNS- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WE'RE FEELING BETTER ABOUT. FEWER BEFORE IT'S JUST THAT IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIFFERENT OUTSIDE OF ISSUE IT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE AND FOR THE RECORD SECONDARY AND SEALS. ARE IN FACT ENFORCEABLE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE BASED ON AESTHETICS AND NOT ON PUBLIC HEALTH REFER YOU ARE VERY OPPOSED TO THE PRODUCERS. I WOULD VERY FOCUSED REVIEWS. OKAY ALL RIGHT HOW. WE GO TO THE PHONE LINES IF ANYONE WANTS TO AND- ADD. VOICE OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. INTERMIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR. ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND FIRST WE HAVE LINE NUMBER EIGHTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS ADAM KING HONEST I'L BE HAPPY SAYS STATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES- SO LIKE IN YELLOW- WE TALK WE DID NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BUT I DID WANT EXPRESS- TRONG CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS- FIRST JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AT THE ANNUAL MENTIONED THERE IS ALREADY A SECONDARY DRINKING WATER STANDARDS FOR MANGANESE- SO WATER SYSTEMS ALREADY MONITOR REPORT ON MANGANESE BECAUSE THE DISCOLORATION- THE STATE WATER BOARD IS. AS DANIEL STATE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE PENALTIES FOR- VIOLATION OF THE MANGANESE MCL UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY- AND SO IF THERE IS THE DESIRE TO HAVE THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT TAKE ADDITIONAL ACTION ON THE NEWS YOU COULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO REVIEW THE CURRENT SCIENCE- AND DETERMINE IF A PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL IS NEEDED I THINK. YOU KNOW THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE ASSUMES THAT WE HOW CAN DEVELOP A PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BY NEXT YEAR WHICH IS A TIGHT TIMELINE BUT IT PRESUPPOSES THAT A PUBLIC HEALTH BOTHUSE IF NEEDED AND CIRCUMVENTS YOU KNOW A REALLY IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC REGULATORY PROCESS THAT IS. THOROUGHLY DONE BY WE HAVE- IN THE STATE WATER BOARD SO I'M I WOULD ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS MANGANESE CONTAMINATION- THE CALIFORNIA DRINK WATER REVOLVING. COULD BE YOU ON TO ADDRESS MANY ISSUES- AS WELL AS I DID GROUND YOU KNOW FUNDING THAT STATE WATER BOARD IS IT. YOU KNOW YEAR THE GOVERNOR. UP AND LEGISLATURE APPROVED SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN DOLLARS. IN DEBT WATER SRF FOR PROJECTS LIKE THIS- SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW FUNDING FOR MAINLY FOR MEDIATION. BE INCENTIVIZED- AND LET THE CURRENT REGULATORY PROCESS YOU KNOW KIND OF WORK THE WAY IT HAS- FOR SO LONG SO- THANK YOU WERE THAT HAPPY TO. WORK WITH. YOU GOING FORWARD. THE TERM. OKAY I'M OKAY SO. LET ME JUST START BY- PHARMACY THINKING THAT THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US AND CRAFTING AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE UNIQUE DRINKING WATER ISSUES AND IN SOUTHERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY- WE GOT DEEP INTO THE REPORT TO YOU THAT I THINK ORIGINALLY INSPIRED THE ORIGINAL BILL AND- AND ONE THING BECAME LOUD AND CLEAR THROUGH THE REPORT WAS THE ISSUE OF MANGANESE POLLUTION- OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN- GRAB SAMPLES TAKEN FROM THE WATER IN SOUTHERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY- MY CA WHERE YOUR PRESENT AND WE SHOWED. THEY SHOWED EXIGENCES OF MANGANESE IN DRINKING WATER MULTIPLE TIMES ABOVE THE EPA ADVISORY LEVEL WHICH YOU KNOW RAISED A WHOLE SLEW OF HEALTH OF HEALTH CONCERNS AFTER YOUR LOGICAL IMPACTS- BUT YOU HAVE. THE WATER QUALITY SAN IS ONLY. THERE'S NO REQUIRE FOR TREATMENT SO. WE SO OUR GOAL THROUGH THE BILL AT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING A WE HAVE. TO PREPARE A PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL FOR MANGANESE. ONCE THE GOALS ESTABLISHED IN REQUIRING THAT. THE WATER BOARD TO ADOPT THE PRIMARY DRINKING WATER CENTER FOR MANGANESE IN THE INTERIM AUTHORIZING THAT. THE WATER BOARD TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR TREATMENT SOURCE PROTECTION. AND ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIES- AND THEN ALSO THE WATER BOARD TO USE EXCEEDED SAYS OF THE SECONDARY STANDARD. FOR MANGANESE IN THE SOURCE WATER OR WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OF A COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEM AS A BASIS FOR FUNDING. PRIORITIZATION I HEARD THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY SOME FOLKS WANTED TO RAISE. CONCERNS ADAM AND DANIELLE. I'M CERTAINLY ONE IT WILL WILL. DO YOU CAN WORKING WITH YOU HI- ONE OF THE OBJECTS WAS THAT WATER. AT TO THE WHEN THE OBJECTION AS IDEA OF THE WATER BOARD- ESTABLISHING A PRIMARY DRINKING WATER CENTER FOR MANGANESE BEFORE WE HAVE TO. HAS CONDUCTED THE SCIENCE I GUESS WE JUST POINT OUT THAT THE LANGUAGE DIRECTS WE HAD TO SET A PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL. THAT'S THE SCIENCE RIGHT. I'M BEFORE THE BOARD ESTABLISH ITS DRINKING WATER STANDARD. I AM SO I THINK THAT THAT ISSUE IS HIS ADDRESS IN OUR MEN'S AND- YEAH THE OTHER THING IS THAT- HI. I'VE EITHER THE QUESTION BY THE END WHETHER IT'S UNNECESSARY. YOU KNOW THE OF COURSE I SITES MY- BELIEF THAT THE BILL WILL GIVE THE FOLKS IT AT WE HAD THE BOARD. A PUSH IN THE BUDGETARY AUTHORITY DOWN THE ROAD AND TO DO THIS. TO DO THIS WORK TO STUDY AND DEVELOP THE DRINKING WATER STANDARD AND FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE. AND SO. YOU KNOW I THINK THE END OF THE DAY WE GOT TO A GOOD PLACE- BUT- BUT BUT I'M CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH OUR OUR FRIENDS FROM THE AGENCIES TO AN- TO. TO GET SCATTERED THEIR ISSUES ADDRESSED BUT I WILL SAY. THIS REPORT WAS PRETTY SHOCKING ABOUT THE MANGANESE LEVELS AND WHATEVER WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING- AND SO I I'M SEEING THIS BILL. AS A WAY FOR US TO PUSH ON THIS ISSUE. AND I THINK YOU MISTER FOR REC. THAT IN ALL COMMITTEE. I THINK ALL OF US. IN OUR- RESPECTIVE THIS. WERE OUT. ALWAYS ABOUT. CLEAN WATER AND- EVERYTHING PERTAINING TO THE HEALTH. OF OUR- AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU. MISTER J. AND WE WALK. TO DO THAT. IN FINALLY PUT THIS THING. TOGETHER WHERE EVERYONE WILL AGREE THAT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THE CONSTITUENTS. AND IS A NO STEP FORWARD. AND I THINK WITH THE WORK THAT AHEAD. WILL BE. TO THAT WORK. WITH YOUR OFFICE AND EVERYONE THAT IS GOOD. CHOI LOOKING FOR. TO CAN. THAT RELATE GONZALEZ. THAT'S THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- YOU SENATOR UP FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SINCE THIS ISN'T A DIFFERENT VERSION. TOO WOULD LIKE TO JUST CONTINUE TO. BE ENGAGED WITH YOU- I'M AS YOU KNOW THIS- THAT TOUCHES BOTH OF OUR DISTRICTS AND I WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE TALKING TO. EACH OF THE- STAKEHOLDERS WHETHER THEY OPPOSE OR THEY SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE FULL CONTEXT OF WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT WE NEED TO. CONTINUE TO WORK ON BUT I ALSO THINK THE COMMITTEE. FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER- PROCESSES IN PLACE FOR AT TACKLING MANGANESE I THINK THAT. FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I THINK IS A GREAT APPROACH- AND SAID LOVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT I WILL. SUPPORT THIS. BILL TODAY BUT I LOOK FOR TO ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE AMENDMENTS WOULD LOOK LIKE AT THE END. SO WE CAN TAKE OF ALL TAKE CARE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. OKAY ARE I WILL TAKE THAT AS A MOTION- AND- WITH THAT WILL ASK YOU TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY YEAR I WROTE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER OKAY- SIGNIFICADO. ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR BY SENATOR ARCHULETA THE MOTION AS HE PASSES AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE BATES. IT'S NOT VOTING TALLY VOTING TALLYING VOTING GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I SKINNER. AYE SKINNER AYE STERN. AYE CASKEY AYE AYE CASKEY AYE. THAT'S NOT. WELL BELIEVE THE ROLE OF FURTHER- GET OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON HERE I WILL GRAB GO TO- CENTER HERTZBERG WHO'S YOUR PRESENT SB. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR. THANK YOU. THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THERE WILL. ASSESSOR TO SENATOR DODD- INTRODUCED A BILL THAT WE VOTE MOST OF US VOTED ON AND- WAS SUCCESSFUL. THAT DEALT WITH- APPOINTING ADMINISTRATORS TO- DO YOU WITH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ADULT WITH THIS MEASURE YOU HAVE YOUR FOR TODAY IS WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS IN GOVERNMENT WHEN WE HAVE A GOOD IDEA AND WE LOOK AT THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AND HOW DOES IT ACTUALLY WORKING IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE COURSE CORRECTED DOESN'T TO BE FURTHER DEALT WITH AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD I THINK MOST OF THE MEMBERS KNOW. REGULAR EXPRESSIONS SEVEN HUNDRED- WATER SYSTEMS ONE THIRD OF THOSE WATER SYSTEMS ARE FAIRLY SMALL RANGING FROM FIFTEEN TO TWO HUNDRED. SERVICE CONNECTIONS AND A NUMBER OF BILLS WITH REGARD TO THOSE OVER THE YEARS. AND OFTEN THOSE ARE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. OF THOSE WATER SYSTEMS OVER THREE HUNDRED THOSE SYSTEMS. MEMBERS CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO THEIR CONTINUED USE. AND THESE WATER SYSTEMS SERVE AN ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD HAVE A MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF AT ANY GIVEN TIME. RECOGNIZING THE EXTENT OF THIS ISSUE. AND THE SMALL SYSTEMS LACK OF THE TECHNICAL MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE. OPERATIONS AT THE AS I SUGGESTED WHAT WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IS WE GRANTED TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE THE STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD THE BILL TO APPOINT. THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS TO ASSIST. IN THOSE FAILING SYSTEMS. BUT THE REALITY IS I SUGGESTED IS THE TOOL HAS NOT BEEN WORKING AS WELL AS IT SHOULD HAVE OF THE THIRTEEN WATER SYSTEMS ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE. ADMINISTRATORS ONLY ONE. ONE HAS APPOINTED. A ONE TO DATE. S. ARE. SO BASED WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SEEING WILLING AND PROMISING CANDIDATES CITE A LACK OF CLARITY AROUND THE STATUTORY LIABILITY. AS A KEY REASON FOR THEIR RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT. ADMINISTRATORS RESPONSES MINISTRY RESPONSIBILITY. THIS IS HAD AS I SAID A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE SUCCESS OF THE WATER BOARD ADMINISTRATOR PROGRAM. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE TODAY IS TO SET UP A FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE A BY BILL PROTECTION TO ADMINISTRATORS WERE WORKING GOOD FAITH WITH WITH REASONABLE EFFORTS. SO WE CAN START REFORMING OUR FIELD WHAT SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION THIS MEASURE ALSO EXPANDS THE APPOINTMENT AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATORS TO DEAL WITH AT RISK SYSTEMS WE DON'T WANT JUST SYSTEMS FAILED. IF SOMETHING'S AT RISK WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT IT AND GET AHEAD OF THE PROBLEM. SO YOU KNOW IS A SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED WATER SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY AT RISK FOR FAILING SIX HUNDRED AND APPROX ME FORTY SEVEN NEW WATER SYSTEMS ADDED TO THE FAILING WATER SYSTEMS. ANNUALLY SO WE KNOW THESE WATER SYSTEMS OF OUR PROBLEM ONCE AND THIS EXPANSION OF THE STORY TOGETHER WITH PROTECTION ONE SURE THAT WE CAN PROACTIVELY GET AHEAD OF THE PROBLEM. WHICH IN MY JUDGMENT IS GOVERNMENT AT ITS BEST. LEARN LISTEN GROW IMPROVE AND GET AHEAD OF THE PROBLEM. IN SHOW OF MY OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS ARE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A POSITION LETTER FROM. THE LAWYER TRIAL OR IS DEALING WITH THIS LIMITED LIABILITY BUT I WHEN I READ IT IS I'VE- VOTED MANY OF THESE OVER THE YEARS. IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION. SOME WE CAN WORK OUT WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO RESPOND TO THEIR TO THEIR- AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT- BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS EXCITING FOR ME BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE ALL COME UP HERE WITH GREAT AGENDAS AND IDEAS BUT WE CAN'T HAVE EVERY GOOD IDEA AND THIS WAS BROUGHT TO ME BY. FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT ON A PHONE CALL TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN BE A GREENER CALIFORNIA SO I'M VERY EXCITED THAT THE GLENDALE ENVIRONMENTAL COALITION SUGGESTED THIS. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS BILL AND HAPPY TO BE PRESENTING IT TODAY- THIS WOULD ESTABLISH A DISH WASHER GRANT PROGRAMS FOR WASTE REDUCTION IN K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CURRENTLY THERE IS NO PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA DEDICATED TO TACKLING THE SINGLE USE. WASTE STREAM COMING FROM K. TWELVE SCHOOL CAFETERIAS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CENTER HERTZBERG LEFT BUT HE AND I ARE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAD PLATES KNIVES AND FORKS IN OUR CAMPUSES AND- ACTUALLY EIGHTY ONE ON FLATWARE AND DIDN'T THROW IT AWAY- INDUSTRIAL DISHWASHING MACHINES PRESENTED UPSTREAM WASTE PREVENTION MEASURE BY AVOIDING SINGLE USE ITEMS IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY RESULT IN LESS WASTE AND ALLEVIATE THE COST OF HAULING IN LITTER CLEANUP FOR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES THEY ALSO NORMALIZE THE RE USE OF DAILY ITEMS TEACHING STUDENTS THE VALUE OF IBM ARE VERY ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IS VERY IMPORTANT SO COVER CURRENT COMMERCIAL DISHWASHING MACHINES USE VERY LITTLE WATER. DRY QUICKLY ARE FAST AND ENERGY EFFICIENT THEY CAN COMPLETE A CYCLE AND ONLY A FEW MINUTES LOWERING THE AMOUNT OF DISHES THAT ARE NEEDED A WELL CARED FOR MACHINE CAN LAST FOR FIFTEEN YEARS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OVER TIME AND OFFSETTING WASTE MANAGEMENT COSTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO RISE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. HOWEVER MOST DISHWASHERS BELIEVE OR NOT REMOVED FROM SCHOOLS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. RECENT STUDIES ESTIMATE THAT ONLY ABOUT 7% OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CAFETERIAS USE DISHWASHERS. COMPARED 27290% IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. AGAIN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE LEADING AND HERE WERE NOT. SB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS UP TO FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SCHOOL DISTRICT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES WINSTAR COMMERCIAL DISHWASHER. THIS WILL ALLOW THE TRANSITION TO SAFER USABLE FOOD WHERE DESIGNED FOR REPEATED USE AND SANITIZING INSTEAD OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE WASTE CRISIS. CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN ELIMINATE THE USE OF SINGLE USE FOOD WHERE AND HELP REDUCE WASTE WHILE INSTILLING THESE VALUES. IN STUDENTS- WHICH IS ALSO EXCITING IS THAT IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL BY THE FROM THE GOVERNOR. IS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RETROFITTING- OUR SCHOOL. CAFETERIAS ALREADY IN SO THERE'S MONEY IN THE BUDGET WE BELIEVE TO COVER THIS. AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING TO THE BUDGET FOLKS ABOUT THAT. AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MONICA COMPAGNIA FROM THE GLENDALE ENVIRONMENTAL COALITION AND ALLEYS. ALEXANDRINA CHAVEZ A POLICY ASSOCIATED CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER ALL RIGHT LET'S START WITH MONICA ON THE PHONE LINE. THANK YOU CHAIR ALLEN AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE MY NAME IS MONICA COMPANION AND MIND YOUR NUMBER WITH RANDOM RANDOM NEW COALITION. AND I CAN CAMPUS AT FRANKLIN ELEMENTARY IN THE GLENDALE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE I WAS PREVIOUSLY A PARENT VOLUNTEER WITH THE PTA GREEN LUNCHROOM COMMITTEE. WITH THE DONATION OF THE DISH MACHINE THREE YEARS AGO BY THE MANUFACTURER. OUR SCHOOL WAS ABLE TO MOVE FROM DISPOSABLES TO USABLE FOR THE CAFETERIA. THE DONATION REMOVED THE HIGH UP FRONT COSTS FOR THE DISTRICT WHICH WHAT'S THE MAIN BARRIER TO ENTRY AND THE PROBLEM. SB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE WILL FALL. UST STARTED BY FINDING THE SPOT WITH THE OLD DISHWASHER USED TO LIVE. AT OUR DISTRICTS LIKE MOST IN CALIFORNIA REMOVED THE MALL IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. THEY DON'T MAKE THE INVESTMENTS NEEDED FOR UPGRADES KITCHEN RECONFIGURATION SURPRISED HE LASTED A FULL YEAR COST ANALYSIS WITH THIS PILOT PROGRAM AND SHOWED A FOUR YEAR PAY BACK. AFTER WHICH THEY SAVE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY MOSTLY FROM NOT HAVING TO PURCHASE THE DISPOSABLES WITH FUNDING FROM SB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE THAT'S EVEN. COM IMMEDIATELY AND SCHOOLS WON'T NEED TO DECIDE BETWEEN REPLACING A FAILING REFRIGERATOR. TACKLING SINGLE USE WASTE. YOUR THANKSGIVING DISHWASHER SALT OR AVOID IT FOR US IN ADDITION TO THE HUGE VOLUME OF WASTE WHEN NO LONGER GENERATING FOR THIS CAFETERIA THE DISTRICT DOESN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH STOCK SHORTAGES AND RISING COSTS OF SINGLE USE ITEMS. WHICH THEY ARE DEALING WITH AND OTHER LOCATIONS. INSTEAD OF CHECKING OUT EIGHT TRASH CANS MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY IN OUR LUNCH ROOM ARTISTS AUDIENCE PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON A NEW ORGANIC FORTY AREA WITH ONE LANDFILL TRASH BINS ONLY. WE NO LONGER THROW AWAY A THOUSAND COMPOSTABLE TRAYS PER WEEK WHICH REQUIRED MANY BAG CHANGES AND QUICKLY FILLED OUR GREEN DUMPSTER. DISTRICTS MONEY WITH ONLY A SINGLE WEEKLY ORGANICALLY KICK UP THAT SERVICE IS REQUIRED NOT ALL SCHOOLS WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND IT'S EXPENSIVE. SELECTICA. NEED MORE SAVINGS WHEN NO LONGER SENDING HIGH AND TEN THOUSAND SPARKED THE LAND IN. I KNOW HOW TO NO LONGER HAVE TO PICK UP ANALYST AMOUNTS OF CELLOPHANE SPORT THAT RAP THAT OFF THE CABLE FOR. THE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALONG TEACHING THE KIDS FROM TO SEE GRADE. PLAY IN THE NOW. OKAY NORMAL TO USE FOR. MINUTES AND THEN TALK TO THE NEXT. TO BE TAKEN AWAY INTO THE NOTHER WORLD. THAT THE KIDS WITH REAL SILVERWARE CARPARK COMPARTMENTALIZED VISIBLE TRADE. AND WE DO THINK THAT OUR PARENTS DID WE WASH THE DISHES. BEGAN OUR DISHWASHER IS STATE OF THE ART IF HE'S TO VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES IS SPENT LESS AND IT RUNS CYCLE IN MINUTES. A LACK OF DISHWASHING EQUIPMENT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST BARRIER TO MAKING THE SWITCH TO REUSABLE. AND MOST SCHOOLS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET TO MAKE THE HIGH UPFRONT INVESTMENT. SB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE WITH OPENER FASTLY FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS OUR STATE. CAPITOL WASTE REDUCTION IN A MEANINGFUL WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IT'S IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH HI MISS COMPANY LISTED ALEXANDRIA CHÁVEZ FROM- CALIFORNIANS WASTE.

A SINGLE USE PLASTIC FOOD WHERE- IS MADE OF LOW QUALITY PLASTIC OR POLYSTYRENE THAT CANNOT BE RECYCLED AND HAS TO BE DISPOSED OF AS WASTE AND TO REFERENCE HELD SCHOOLS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS THE GLENDALE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT REPORTED THAT THEY USE.

THE JUDGE ENTERED A- FAVOR CAN YOU OFFER DISCO KEEP ROLLIN. THAT WAS A GOOD BILL OKAY GREAT LET'S GO TO. THE NECROTIZING. I THINK YOU A MISTER TERRENCE SANDERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA TAKES A LEADERSHIP ROLE. IN ADVANCING CLIMB RESTORATION. TAKEN STEPS TO MINIMIZE EMBODIED CARBON AND- MAXIMIZE CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. THE CO TWO CAN BE STORED OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING ROADS AND BUILDINGS THESE STRATEGIES PROVIDE VALUABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO STORE CARBON AND ENORMOUS POTENTIAL SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS. CLIMATE PRIORITIES SB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN WILL REQUIRE THE STATE TO DEVELOP A PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO MINIMIZE EMBODIED CARBON IN MAXIMIZE CARBON SEQUESTRATION. IN BUILDING MATERIALS NOTABLY THIS WOULD GREATLY EXPAND THE REACH FOR STATES CURRENT EMBODIED CARBON REDUCTION GOALS. INCLUDE MATERIALS SUCH AS CEMENT CONCRETE AGGREGATES. LUMBER CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER STEEL AND MORE. OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT. OF COURSE IS A LARGE GHG EMITTER. IN BODY CARBON OR GHG EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCING USING BUILDING MATERIALS ACCOUNTS FOR AT LEAST ELEVEN PERCENT. OF GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS. DESPITE HIGH GHG IMPACTS FROM BUILDING MATERIALS IN THE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL THE OPPORTUNITY AS CALIFORNIA'S GHG GOALS AND CLIMATE RESTORATION. LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS THESE TALKS IN CALIFORNIA. SB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE STAKEHOLDER INPUT IN FOR STATE AGENCIES TO DEVELOP PLANS COUNTY FRAMEWORKS AND OTHERWISE ENCOURAGE USE OF BUILDING MATERIALS WERE FEASIBLE WITH LOWER NEGATIVE EMPLOYEE CARBON EMISSIONS TO HELP. BEGIN MAXIMIZE LEVEL OF CARBON SEQUENCE SEQUESTRATION IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. SB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN FALLS IN ANNOUNCEMENTS AT THE RECENT TWENTY TWENTY ONE UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE IN GLASGOW SCOTLAND FROM THE PACIFIC COAST COLLABORATIVE THAT PARTNERING JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA WILL WILL WORK TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION INVESTMENT AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT FOR LOW CARBON MATERIALS. IT ALSO COMES ON THE HEELS OF THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION REGARDING NEW ACTIONS TO ADVANCE A PRODUCTION AND USE OF LOW CARBON BUILDING MATERIALS MADE IN AMERICA. AND GUIDANCE ON RESPONSIBLE DEPLOYMENT OF CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION AND SEQUESTRATION TO HELP ACHIEVE A CARBON NEUTRAL CON. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN. A VITAL OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHARTER GLOBAL PATH FORWARD IN CLIMB RESTORATION. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENT. BUT NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TO CLARIFY. THAT THIS BILL S. O. PR TO EVALUATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IN WHICH USE OF LOW EMBODIED CARBON BUILDING MATERIALS OR CARBON SEQUESTRATION BUILDING MATERIALS QUALIFIES. AS AN ACCEPTABLE GHG MITIGATION MEASURE PURSUANT TO SEE WHAT. THE CURRENT BILL LANGUAGE INCLUDE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT FROM LABOR. INSURERS THROUGH THIS BILL WE ARE ADVANCING METHODS IN BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT CAN. AND WILL CREATE AND MAINTAIN JOBS FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS THAT WILL PROVIDE MIDDLE CLASS WAGES AND BENEFITS IN UNION REPRESENTATION ULTIMATELY FROM INDUSTRY I WANT TO JUST TOUCH UPON THOSE REAL QUICK- IT CBI IN SOME OTHER INDUSTRY GROUPS WERE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. WORKING ON AMENDMENTS TO HOPEFULLY FULLY ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND TO FIND FEASIBLE WHICH I THINK IS REALLY OF THE CONCERN THERE THE WORD FEASIBLE- IS IN THE BILL- BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND I THINK IT'S- IT'S PROBABLY ACCURATE TO SAY WHAT WE WANT TO DO IN TERMS OF REMEMBRANCES. A TO DEFINE FEASIBLE AS MATERIAL- CAPABLE BEING INSTALLED A SUCCESSFUL MANNER WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS ALSO MATERIAL THAT DOES NOT HARM THE HEALTH OR SAFETY OF THOSE WHO INSTALL MATERIALS WERE OCCUPIED THE BUILDING THAT SEEMS. TO BE GOOD COMMONSENSE THE MATERIAL THAT PROVIDES THE SAME FUNCTION AT LEAST SAME DURABILITY USEFUL LIFE AND PERFORMANCE AS BASELINE MATERIALS- THAT'S UNDER CONSIDERATION THE MATERIAL THAT DOES NOT POSE. AN INCREASED RISK OF A CONSTRUCTION OR DESIGN DEFECT OR CONSPIRE CONSTITUTE A THREAT TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE BUILDING MATERIAL THAT IS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN THE REGION OF THE PROJECT WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE CALIFORNIA AND THE SUBREGIONS. OF THOSE ARE ALL- OF THE ITEMS THAT I THINK JUST HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF THE DEFINITION IN THE BILL OF THE WORD FEASIBILITY PUT THIS FEASIBILITY ME- THOSE ARE NOT ON THE TABLE TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE STILL TRYING TO WORK THROUGH. OF LANGUAGE- WITH INDUSTRY. ASSOCIATION THAT HAVE THAT BROUGHT THAT UP- WITH ME TODAY IS- TERRY YOU REPRESENTING THE FOUNDATION FOR CLIMATE RESTORATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AS WELL AS LAURA BERLIN SHEEN REPRESENTING BLUE PLANET. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THAT I KNOW LONG PRESENTATION- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU SIR LET'S START WITH TERRY.

OUR ORGANIZATION IS FOCUSED ON REACHING THREE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION OF CO TWO BY TWENTY FIFTY WHICH IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE OUR FIRST YEAR HOPPERS THAT DAY. WHICH OF COURSE IS STILL BECAUSE WE SEE THIS AS A SOLUTION THAT CAN HELP RESTORE THE ATMOSPHERE AND REACH OUR GOAL FOR MOVING THAT LEGACY CARBON BUT IT'S SIMPLE TO GET EACH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA SB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN HAS A FOCUS ON MINIMIZING EMBODIED CARBON AND MAXIMIZING REQUESTED CARBON IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN TAKES A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN ADVANCING CLIMATE RESTORATION. EMBODIED CARBON FROM THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT ACCOUNT FOR AT LEAST AT THE FOUNDATION FOR QUITE RESTORATION SB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN CORPORATE CLIMATE RESTORATION SOLUTION. BECAUSE IT STARTS CARBON IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND WILL ENABLE NET NEGATIVE EMISSIONS HEALTH BROUGHT DOWN WITH A CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS. WHICH CAN BE DONE SAFELY FOR THE ARMENIAN ECONOMICALLY WE SEE THIS IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN GETTING CLOSER TOWARD RESTORING THE CLIMATE AND BEAUTY STANDARDS FOR THE INDUSTRY.

BY CONVERTING CAPTURED CO TWO INTO HIGH VALUE BUILDING MATERIALS. AT LEAST FINANCED WE CAPTURE IN MINERALIZED. TWO TO SAFELY AND PERMANENTLY SEQUESTER IT INTO ROCK. THE ROCK WE PRODUCE. IS THEN USED AS A RAW MATERIAL INPUT. IN THE CONCRETE PRODUCTION PROCESS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WE CAN START BASS QUANTITIES OF CO TWO IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. PARTICULARLY WITH CONCRETE.

THANK YOU THAT'S TRUE A LOT NUMBER FOURTEEN GOING TO STOP WORKING. HELLO THIS IS CRYSTAL SHOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION- WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED- CENTER CORTESE HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THOSE- PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WERE WORKING ON SO WE APPRECIATE. THE SENATOR AND HIS STAFF WORKING WITH US AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIM ON SB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU. MISTER CHEROKEE WAS QUICK GREAT THANK YOU OKAY LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS THOUGHTS COMMENTS AND- CASKEY- SINCE THIS BILL DOESN'T GO THE JUDICIARY GOES TO NATURAL RESOURCES. THE STAFF REPORT RAISES THE- DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE ISSUE AS BY ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA MADE. PRODUCTS GET A PREFERENCE VERSES WE JUST BUY THEM AND THE CONSTITUTIONALITY THAT.

ITEM NUMBER TWELVE SB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN BY SENATOR CORTESE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER ALLEN AYE. ALLEN AYE DATE. BATES NOTE DALLY. GONZALEZ AND SALAS I SKINNER SKINNER AYE STERN AYE STERN AYE WIECKOWSKI AYE CASKEY AYE. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER FOLKS THAT ON- THREE SENATORS NOW HERE SO SHE'S GONNA PRESENT ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN AND YOUR AGENDAS MEMBERS THAT'S SB TWELVE. OH SIX. YOU'RE RIGHT IS THE THING- SB NINE FIVE FIRST. THE CCS OKAY SO START WITH SB NINE OH FIVE THAT'S ITEM FOURTEEN YOUR PACKETS. YOU MAY PROCEED. RIGHT THAT HERE MEMBERS IN THE US AND I THINK ALL OF US REALIZE THAT WE- THE MAN IS ESSENTIAL TO. WE LOOK AT THE NEW FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. MUCH OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WORK IS GONNA NEED CEMENT WE KNOW THAT OUR HOUSING COMMITMENTS ARE GOING TO NEED CEMENT AND WE FROM MY POINT OF VIEW WE WANT TO KEEP THE CEMENT INDUSTRY HERE AND THE REASON WE WANT TO KEEP IT HERE THE CEMENT PRODUCED ELSEWHERE. IS SO MUCH HIGHER CARBON AND SO MUCH MORE POLLUTING IN THOSE IN THE LOCAL AREA FOR WHERE IT'S- FIVE- PRODUCED THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PRODUCE THE MATERIALS THAT WE NEED. A HAND TO DO THOSE IN AS ENVIRONMENTALLY SMART WAYS POSSIBLE THE LAST YEAR SENATOR BECKER CARRIED A BILL THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW THE PUT NEW REQUIREMENTS ON THE DECARBONISATION OF THIS MINISTRY. AND CEMENT IS UNIQUE PRODUCT BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS THERE A LOT OF CARBON INVOLVED IN THE HIGH IT'S A VERY ENERGY INTENSIVE BUT THERE'S ALSO CARBON IS A BY PRODUCT AS PART OF ITS PROCESSING IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF IT. AND SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE CEMENT BUT IT'S ESSENTIAL. SO WHAT MY BILL DOES IS IGNORE ALLEGE THAT AT THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND YET WE'RE STILL NEED MATERIALS THAT HAVE CARBON ASSOCIATED HOW DO WE DO THAT AS SMART AS POSSIBLE WELL IN THIS IN THIS CASE CAPTURING THE CARBON. AND THEN ALLOWING US TO STORAGE. IS ONE WAY TO DECARBONISE CEMENT SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE A PILOT PROJECT FOR. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO TEST THE VIABILITY OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE OF CARPETING CARBON. AND BY ALLOWING US TO CAPTURE CARBON FROM INDUSTRIAL PROCESS. FIVE THE I'VE BUT THE BILL WAS BUILT IN VARIOUS PROTECTIONS TO HELP ANY COMMUNITIES THAT MAY BE DOWNWIND OF- THE CEMENT PRODUCTION IT ALSO LIMITS THE CARBON FROM FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION. FIVE RELATED TO IT AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS BUT LET ME TURN MY WITNESSES NOW I'VE GOT DOCTOR REBEKAH DEL FROM CLIMATE WORKS AND ELLIE CONE FROM THE CLIMATE CENTER. GREAT LET'S START WITH AMERICA. HELLO UP I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE THEIR WORK ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY TO TALK ABOUT SB NINE ZERO FIVE- I LEAVE THE LARGEST NONPROFIT PROGRAM TO ELIMINATE GREENHOUSE GASES FROM THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. IN THE WORLD IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA PASSED SB FIVE NINETY SIX COMMITTING THE STATE TO ZERO OUT ITS CEMENT EMISSIONS BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. MINUTES THE LARGEST SOURCE OF MANUFACTURING EMISSIONS IN THE STATE WITH BETWEEN TWO AND 3% OF TOTAL STATE EMISSIONS IT'S ALSO EMISSIONS. OF CALIFORNIA CAN DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNICAL POLICY AND BUSINESS FEASIBILITY OF GHG FREE CEMENT THAT CAN HAVE A MUCH GREATER IMPACT AROUND THE WORLD. AND NO ONE HAS FIGURED THIS OUT YET SO CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP IS BADLY NEEDED. US CEMENT IS THE SECTOR WITH THE CLEAREST CASE FOR RELYING ON CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS SO IF WE WANT TO START TO EXPLORE CCS AS A PATHWAY TO CLIMATE ACTION. CEMENT IS THE CORRECT NO REGRETS PLACE TO START. THE MAN IS ALSO CRITICAL BECAUSE AS SENATOR SKINNER SAID ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS ACROSS OUR ECONOMY WILL REQUIRE THAT WE BUILD AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT. OF NEW TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND IF WE CONTINUE TO USE CONVENTIONAL CEMENT OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE CLIMATE DAMAGE COULD THEMSELVES BECOME DRIVERS OF CLIMATE DAMAGE CLIMATE DAMAGE FROM CEMENT WILL ALSO HELP US TO ADDRESS ITS PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS CALIFORNIA'S CEMENT KILNS ARE THE ONLY FACILITIES REMAINING IN THE STATE THAT STILL RELY ON DIRECT COAL BURNING. FOR THEIR ENERGY. THEY HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF SOX EMISSIONS A CRITICAL LOCAL AIR POLLUTANT AND THAT THE IMPACT OF THIS POLLUTION FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. CAPTURING THE CARBON WILL ALSO REQUIRE US TO ELIMINATE THESE LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS SB NINE OH FIVE IS A TIMELY AND IMPORTANT BILL. N. IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER POLICIES IT WILL HELP TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED CLIMATE LEADERSHIP THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS VENTURA MANCHA ON THE HALF THE CLIMATE CENTER- STANDING UP AT THE CLOSE AMERICAN AFFAIRS MANAGER. AT THE CLINTON CENTER IS A POLICY NONPROFIT WORKING TO RAPIDLY REDUCE CLIMATE POLLUTION AT SCALE STARTING CALIFORNIA WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB NINE FIVE. AS MILLS RECENTLY OUTLINED IN THE I. P. C. SIX THE SEVEN REPORT MEET ACTIONS MUST BE TAKEN TO HEAD OFF THE WORST OUTCOMES OF CLIMATE CRISIS. INCLUDING CAREFUL CONSIDERATION ALL TECHNOLOGIES. WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN PROMISING CLIMATE DISCUSSION WE'RE AT AN INFLECTION POINT AS TO WHAT TO DO WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. FOR THE CLIMATE CENTER THIS DISCUSSION BEGINS WITH A VERY CLEAR BOUNDARY CCS SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR CARBON CAPTURE OF FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION EMISSIONS OR FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE AND USES A CCS LEVEL CONTINUED FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION POLLUTION WHILE CONTINUING TO UNJUSTLY VERDANT THAT'S LIKE COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY CCS DOES HAVE A STRIKING TRACK RECORD WITH RESPECT WITH ACCENT PORTABILITY IN EXISTING POSSIBLE PROJECTS. THAT SAID CCS MAY HAVE A CRITICAL I'M SO SORRY MISTER REMAIN WITH YOUR PREVIOUS WINNERS TOOK UP MOST THE TIME TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU COULD IF YOU COULD GO. VISIT WITH US ABSOLUTELY SO WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS. INCLUDING CONTINUING TO KEEP THE. STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION IS HERE TO SAVE. THE BILL IS NEEDED OUR PROCESSING. STILL IT IS TO ALSO. CONTAINED THERE ARE NONE CO TWO. AND MEANINGFUL. WITH THE CAN. THAT IN THESE. PLANS BUT SB NINE FIVE INCLUDES THE SAFEGUARDS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY I ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL HERE IN PERSON YOU HAVE TO COME UP AND- STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. I'M RIGHT BOB STAY WITH PROJECT TWENTY THIRTY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIKE MONICA ON THE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. OKAY SERVE FOR FOLKS TO KNOW THAT SOME. OKAY BUT THE PERPETRATORS AND OPPOSITIONISTS THOUGH IS THAT RIGHT. OKAY YES. AFTER GOOD MORNING I'M TOM TEETH WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA CEMENT ASSOCIATION AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EMPHASIZE TO THIS GROUP THAT THE CALIFORNIA CEMENT PRODUCERS ARE COMMITTED TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE HAVE THAT GOAL IN PLACE WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH ARE YOU RAISING CONCERNS WITH A BILL YOUR YOUR ON A KNOCKED OUT OF A POSITION YET BUT- FOLLOWING SUPPORT OKAY WHY TO AT LEAST MENTION WHERE WE STAND SIR IT WILL ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY ARE NOT SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY SIX LAST YEAR. WE FEEL AS A GROUNDBREAKING A BILL TO HELP US GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION OF STORAGE ARE HE COMPORTED OF US GETTING THAT WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT IT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL WE STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT- I THINK THIS COULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US THANK YOU THAT INVOKES THE FIGHTING SIX ONE SENATE BACKERS BONE CEMENT. THE RIVER OKAY THANK YOU. I OKAY ANYONE WHO WANTS TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL OPPOSITION OKAY SEE. VIRGIL HERE COME ON UP AND DOWN. FIRE AWAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- I'LL CUT TO THE CHASE AND- WE'VE GOT SOME CLOCK MANAGEMENT ISSUES- AS WELL LET ME BE CLEAR- THIS BILL IS TOO CONSTRAINING- WE FULLY AGREE WITH- CENTER SKINNER THAT CCS IS A CRITICAL PART OF A CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- THE REALITY IS THAT WE WILL NOT ACHIEVE OUR TARGETS IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT DEPLOYMENT OF CCS TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS AND SO CEMENT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THOSE SECTORS- IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT SECTOR. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS APPLICATIONS IN MULTIPLE SECTORS AND AT MULTIPLE- FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW- THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM CCS TECHNOLOGIES- AT LEAST SEVENTY FIVE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA- COULD BENEFIT FROM THE DEPLOYMENT OF A WHOLE RANGE OF C. C. U. S. TECHNOLOGIES- THE CEMENT SECTOR- COMPRISES EIGHT FACILITIES VERY IMPORTANT SECTOR- BUT OUR CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT THE FOCUS ON CEMENT- COULD VERY WELL HAVE THE IMPACT- IMPEDING- OTHER CRITICAL- CCS DEPLOYMENT IN AND OTHER SECTORS THE POWER SECTOR THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR- THE MATHIS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IN TERMS OF- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. IF WE'RE GOING TO MEET OUR SCIENTIFICALLY DRIVEN CLINICALS- SO FOR THAT REASON- WE WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY SEE THIS BILL- NOT NECESSARILY BE PREFERENTIAL TO A CERTAIN SECTOR BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WE NEED IN THE STATE IS REALLY A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR ANY INDUSTRY THAT WANTS TO INVEST IN CCS TECHNOLOGY- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- SPEAK WITH YOU AND I WOULD HOPE. TO WORK WITH YOU TOWARD THAT IN GOING FORWARD. THE YOU MISTER WELCH OKAY ARE ELSE WANTS TO RAISE CONCERNS THE BILL. SACKLER WITH THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AS PRODUCES US THEY'VE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES YOU WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS OR OPPOSITION BILL. ONCE YOUR PHONES PRESS ONE ZERO PLEASE SEND YOUR FIRST LINE OF A ONE GOAL ONE ONE HALF. GALAKHOV FOR THREE FIFTY DOLLARS VALLEY- HAVE- SUPPORT IMPLEMENTED POSITION WE WISH TO ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS- THREE FIFTY HUMBOLDT. AND THANKS VERY MUCH WE HOPE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OFFER ON THE BILL. NEXT TO ONE NUMBER SEVENTY NINE GO AHEAD PLEASE.

MOST OF MY NUMBER NINETY PLEASE GO AHEAD OF. YOU ALSO ALONG HERE ON BEHALF OF THE YEAR IT'S GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL IN LOS ANGELES IN STRONG SUPPORT ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE SAYS PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT WOULD BE THAT IT YEAH I WAS ONE OF MY FOLKS WERE NOW IN OPPOSITION. NEVER CALLED THE PHONE FOR IS THERE FOR SUPPORT. WELL YEAH IS THAT RIGHT. SO I'M WE'RE HERE FOR EVERYONE THEN. IT'S A FREE FOR ALL ON THE PHONES. EXCITEMENT OKAY LET'S HEAR THE NEXT CALLER.

LEXELL ONE ONE OH FOR GOD'S PLEASE. ONE ONE FOUR ONE ZERO FROM. I'M ALL FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED ON YOUR SIDE YOUR LINE IS OPEN AND YOU'RE AVAILABLE NOT ADDRESS MANY. LET'S MOVE ON MATTER. ONE OF THIS IS YOUR THE QUEUE IS CLEAR WITHOUT THERE ARE NO OTHER RESPONDENTS OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MY APOLOGIES THAT I THINK IS WHEN THE- TO MAKE I GOT UP AND RAISE CONCERNS. DURING THE SUPPORT I STARTED MOVING OVER TO OPPOSITION MODE IN MY MIND SO. THERE WE ARE- GREAT WELL THIS IS A GOOD GOOD ROBUST DISCUSSION SOME GOOD IMPACT- INPUT FROM BOTH SIDES HI WHAT ONE WE- ARE NOW OPEN FOR DISCUSSION FROM THE COMMITTEE. THOUGHTS WESTON'S THUNDERSTORMS. YOU EARN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR BUT ALSO YOUR LEADERSHIP- LAST YEAR IN LOOKING AT A BROADER NATIONAL WORKING LANDS AND TRYING TO BUILD SOME SOME PARAMETERS IN THE SPACE THAT WE CAN REALLY NOT HYPOTHESIZE ABOUT THE C. C. U. S. CONVERSATION BUT ACTUALLY- DIG INTO WHAT THE PRACTICALITIES PROJECT OR AND STARTING WITH WITH WITH THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT I THINK PEOPLE ON THE WHOLE- SHOULD AGREE ON- I THINK YOU. THINK THE CONSTRAINTS IN THE BILL OUR OUR PRUDENT AT THIS POINT- BEN WALLER ARE COMMITTEE WOULD NORMALLY HAVE JURISDICTION. OVER THESE KINDS OF ISSUES I KNOW WERE YOU BE OTHERWISE TRIPLE REFERRED TO I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SENATE EDUCATION NEXT. BECAUSE YOU'VE CREATED A UC PROGRAMMER YOU SEE INSTITUTE OF SOME SORT- TO BE THE HUB IS A COULD BE ALSO IT CSU OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS WELL BUT- I WOULD JUST. COMMIT THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCE IN WATER COMMITTEES- ASSISTANCE TO YOU GOING FORWARD ON THIS MEASURE- ESPECIALLY AS YOU WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE MORE COMPLEX ISSUES. THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN% SOME SOME REALLY TIGHTLY WRITTEN- PROVISIONS IN THIS MEASURE BUT THAT. THAT MAY I'M NOT I'M I'M NOT CONVINCED YET WHETHER THEY'LL NEED. SORT OF MORE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK WHETHER WE CAN GET SOME OF THIS WORK DONE AT THE REGULATORY LEVEL SO FOR INSTANCE THE- SEVENTY ONE TWO NINE FIVE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- ENSURING THAT- ALL THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS- AND- RESPONSIBILITIES SO SEE WITH. FEW TO STORM THE GEOLOGIC STORAGE RESERVOIR- OUR OUR SORT OF WRAPPED UP IN THE ITLE- I LIKE THE FINAL COROLLARY THAT INCLUDES THE LIABILITY FOR AND ANY AND ALL DAMAGES CAUSED BY. ANOTHER WORDS IF YOU HAVE A RELEASE FROM A PROJECT OF THAT CEILING FORMATION DOESN'T WORK FOR WHATEVER REASON WHAT RECOURSE DO WE HAVE UNDER OUR GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAM- AND IN THE PAST SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED AND PERHAPS EVEN YOUR SPONSOR THE CLIMATE WORKS FOLKS MAY KNOW BUT THERE'S BEEN THAT THE IDEA OF A OF A TRUST OR SOME KIND OF INSURANCE MECHANISM. THAT THERE'S A BUFFER ACCOUNT IF YOU WILL IN CASE OF ANY RELEASE YOU'RE NOT SORT OF FORCED INTO A LITIGATION STANCE IF THINGS GO WITH OF WRONG WITH THE PROJECT BUT THAT THERE'S SORT OF A BUILT IN UP FRONT. EITHER BOND OR SOME KIND OF REQUIREMENT I THINK A LOT OF YOU'VE LEFT SPACE FOR A LOT OF THAT IN THE BILL TO BE WORKED THROUGH I THINK THIS THE UNIT IS ASIAN ISSUE AND SORT OF POROSITY RIGHTS IS ANOTHER BIG ONE WE KNOW THERE'S A SPLIT STATE BETWEEN- THE MINERAL STATE- AS WELL AS THE SERVICES STATE AND- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE PROJECTS THAT WE DO ONE OF THIS BILL- THEY WORK AND THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE VIABLE AND THEY REALLY DO PROVIDE NOT JUST- ENVIRONMENTALLY DURABLE PATH TO GO FORWARD BUT BUT ONE OF THE MARKETS ONE THE WORK FORCE WHEN THAT INVESTORS ARE GOING TO BE. SEIZE FEASIBLE SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE- TAKING A FIRST SMALL STEP I THINK IS THE SMARTER APPROACH HERE- AND- YEAH I JUST WANT TO PLEDGE OUR OUR WORK I KNOW THERE WERE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- BY THE COMMITTEE FROM FROM OUR COMMITTEE HERE BUT- BUT I THINK. I WOULD BE CURIOUS AND YOU CAN DO. IT IN YOUR CLOSER OTHERS CAN MAKE REMARKS BUT- HOW TO DEAL. THAT SORT OF THE UNDERLYING A STATE AND MAKING SURE THERE'S ENOUGH CERTAINTY ABOUT- THE RIGHTS TO THAT VALUE THAT ASSET. AND THEN SORT OF RECOURSE THAT WE HAVE NGUYEN. SEISMICITY FOR INSTANCE RIGHT LIKE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT A- THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH OF A REGIME ON HOW UNDER THE CLASSICS WILL CITY PA THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE SEISMICITY BUILT INTO THAT FRAMEWORK. HOW CAN WE DO THAT IS A STATE IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY SO JUST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THINK ABOUT GOING FORWARD BUT- HAVING MOVED THE- BILL IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND PROCEED TO WORK. YEAH AND I WILL I WILL SAY I MEAN I. WITH WITH WITH SO MUCH RESPECT OUR FRIENDS THE RULES COMMITTEE I WAS A LITTLE MYSTIFIED BY THE WAY THAT THIS BILL WAS- WAS AND REFERRED I DO THINK THAT NATURAL SERVICES AND WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN. THE OBVIOUS PLACE FOR THIS TO GO- BUT THAT BEING SAID- WE DID INCLUDE AN EXTENSIVE NOTE FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THE ANALYSIS TWELVE ON PAGES TWELVE AND THIRTEEN I JUST I WOULD ASK YOU SENATOR. TO TO WORK CLOSELY WITH- WITH NOT ONLY OUR COMMITTEE BUT BUT ALSO- GOOD ACTORS WATER COMMITTEE I TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE TECHNICAL DETAILS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE IN THE COMIC GIVEN THEIR- PARTICULAR EXPERTISE IN IN THE AREA OF. OIL EXTRACTION CARBON CAPTURE ITS ADDRESS SO- WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING I WOULD- I TO MOVE BY CENTER STERN AND WE ASK YOU TO CLOSE. THANK YOU THE BENEFIT OF WHAT THE BILLS WITH. CONSTRUCTED AS PILOT PROJECT. AND THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS THAT AS PILOT PROJECTS. WE HOPE TO. LEARN YOU CAN ALWAYS KNOW WHAT. WHAT AND- DIFFICULTY IN MY FACE OR WHAT COMPLICATIONS YOU COULD FACE UNTIL YOU PILOTED IF WE JUST OPENED UP CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE TO OSMAN INDUSTRY OR TO EVEN MORE INDUSTRIES BEFORE WE'VEREALLY HAD THE ABILITY TO TRY IT OUT THE MEASURE IT THE WAY IT IS TWO RESEARCH WHICH IS PART OF THE REASON THE WE HAVE THE EDUCATION COMPONENT TO HAVE A CARD ESTABLISH EITHER AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGES CSU OR UC AN INNOVATION HUB IN ORDER TO LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE I MEAN I PERSONALLY BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. IN A LOT MORE THAN JUST CEMENT BUT THIS IS A GOOD FIRST START AND LIKE SO MANY THINGS I MEAN YES THERE THERE COULD BE AN EARTHQUAKE AND THAT WOULD RELEASE THE CARBON THAT WAS GEOLOGICALLY STORED MOST LIKELY BUT LOOK AT OUR WILDFIRES LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING AT MY FRIEND OVER HERE LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF CARBON THAT'S GOTTEN RELEASED AS A RESULT OF THOSE SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE UNDER OUR CONTROL BUT THOSE THAT WHICH ARE. NOW WE NEED TO DO OUR BEST TO DO IT WITHOUT A ESCRIBIR. I'M I'M SO BUT SANTA CLAUS HAS A VERY BRIEF COMMA TO ME BECAUSE COULD LET ME. OF THE KNOW THAT HI TO HAVE A- OF CARBON CAPTURE PROGRAM THIS DEMONSTRATION WILL- BASE WILL INCLUDE NATURAL GAS AND- THE METHANE ALSO TOOK. OUT A SISTER A BILL TO THIS THEY'RE WORKING A COOPERATIVELY SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ON UNIONIZATION AND- IT WILL GO TO ENERGY FOR THAT. ROBUST DISCUSSION JUST SO EVERYBODY KNOWS MORSE COMING. GREAT OKAY CERTAINLY KALRA. THE ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN SB NINE OH FIVE BY SENATOR SKINNER THE MOTION IS DUE PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION ALAN HI ALAN I BATES BATES NOTE DALLY DALLY NO GONZALEZ AND SALAS I SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE STERN RIGHT STERN AYE BY CASKEY BY CASKEY I'D- OKAY. LET'S NOW GO TO YOUR NEXT BILL THAT SELLS SB TWELVE A SIX WILL BE THE ROLE OF ANY OTHER ONE FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT ON. THIS ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN YOUR PACKETS MEMBER AT EVERYBODY I THINK. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. RIGHT OKAY. THANKS SO MUCH SIR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SO THIS BILL IS THE ANOTHER ONE OF THESE- TECHNICAL BILLS AROUND OUR CLIMATE CRISIS THERE ARE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS THAT ONLY LASTS THE ATMOSPHERE TWENTY ODD YEARS BUT DURING THE TIME THEY ARE IN THE ATMOSPHERE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF TIMES MORE DAMAGING TO THE CLIMATE. THAN CARBON DIOXIDE SO GIVEN THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS RIGHT NOW AND FOR SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE- WATCH THE- REPORTS AROUND THE LATEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF THE JUST- COLLAPSED- WE NEED TO ACT AGGRESSIVELY BUT ACTING AGGRESSIVELY AROUND THE FULL TRANSITION OFF FOSSIL FUELS IS A LITTLE HARDER IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S HARDER AND SO IF WE CAN AS MUCH AS WE CAN GET. THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE RIGHT NOW THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN A PRICES TIME THE PARTICULAR SHORTLIVED POLLUTANT THAT 'M FOCUSED ON HERE IS HSCS USED IN REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING NOW WE'VE ALREADY DONE LEGISLATION WE'VE GONE A LONG WAY TO- TO REDUCING THE- THE- G. EIGHT THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF THOSE AGENCIES BUT- THERE ARE. AVAILABLE ALL. NOW AND THERE ARE LOWER GWP OR GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AGENCIES AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET. AND SO WE JUST NEED TO MORE AGGRESSIVELY MOVED TO DOES ADDITIONALLY. AT AIR CONDITIONERS REFRIGERANTS THEY LEAK AND IF THEY HAVE THE HIGHER GLOBAL WARMING HFC IN THEM AND IT LEAKS THEN THAT GOES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE SO THE MORE OF THAT WE CAN RECLAIM AND RECAPTURE THOSE AND WHILE MY BILL DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC PROVISION. THAT REQUIRES THAT IT DOES LET CARD DEVELOP SOME PATHWAYS IN IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCENTIVIZE THE CAPTURE OF THOSE REFRIGERANTS BEFORE THEY ESCAPE- AND I HOPE THAT THEY WILL DEVELOP A PROGRAM TO DO SO. ON THAT MY BILL AT LEAST CREATES THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO LOOK AT THAT- SO I'M GONNA LET MY- EXPERTS SPEAK FROM THE MAIN PART OF THE YEAR ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS YES AN ACCEPTABLE MOMENTS THE MAIN PART OF BILL HOWEVER THERE IS THE- IS. BRINGING FORWARD THE TIMELINE FOR WHEN THE HIGHEST GLOBAL WARMING HSCS ARE ALLOWED TO BE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA- AND ALSO TO UPDATE OR APPLIANCE STANDARDS THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS BUT IT DOES ALLOW CARP ALL STEWART TO EXPLORE OTHERS SO ALLOW ME TO HAVE CRISTINA STORE. FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION AGENCY. AND ALEX- BRAND FROM IN OUR DC. AS MY WITNESS THREE ALL RIGHT LET'S START WITH THEM MISTER. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS CRISTINA START BUYING ON BEHALF OF ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION AGENCY AND SUPPORTED AT THE PUBLIC SECTOR. YEAH A HAS PARTICIPATED IN INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE THIS USED FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES. WE MUST ACCELERATE HE'S A BAKER EMISSION REDUCTION BEYOND OUR CURRENT SCHEDULE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ARE GLOBAL FINANCIALS UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT. THE BILL PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE WAY AND DOING JUST THAT. FIRST BY RESTRICTING SALES OF NEWLY PRODUCED AGENCIES IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ENCOURAGE INCREASED RECOVERY RECLAMATION. ANDRECYCLING OF AGENCIES AND REDUCE WEEKS WHICH WILL HAVE AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON REDUCING EMISSIONS IT'S RELATIVELY EASY TO CAPTURE USER FOR DRINKS OR OLD EQUIPMENT AND RECLAIM NUMBER USE. THE PROBLEMS ARE ALREADY RECLAIMED EACH YEAR AND THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP MAKE THIS MORE COST EFFECTIVE BY INCREASING DEMAND AND GIVING HER HER. DRAG OUT YOU IF AND THE FLIGHT. THANK THIS BUDGET MANDATE THE CAR AND THE BEAUTY DEVELOP. TO INCREASE ADOPTION OF NO OR VERY LOW GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES AGENCIES IN EUROPE BUT THAT. INCLUDING THROUGH FOR THE REGULATORY MEASURES AND INCENTIVES. VERY LOW GWP ALTERNATIVES ARE INCREASINGLY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN THE U. S. GLOBALLY FOR A RANGE OF USERS. AND THE INDUSTRY CAN AND SHOULD TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE MOST HARMFUL REFRIGERANT ULTIMATELY MOVING TOWARDS REFRIGERANTS WITH LOW OR NO CLIMATE IMPACT. WE NEED STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA TO LEADING GROWING THE MARKET FOR THESE NEW CLIMATE ALTERNATE THAT TO TESTIFY AND I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO BACK SUPPORT DRAFT LEGISLATION FORWARD A POSITIVE VOTE. ALL RIGHT NEXT ONE IS PLEASE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS ALEX PHIL GRAMM ALEX A BRAND OF AN ADVOCATE WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. AN RTC SUPPORTS MOVING SB TWELVE ZERO SIX FORD WELL. WE'VE ALSO WORKED FOR SEVERAL DECADES PROTECT THE OZONE LAYER AND CLIMATE SYSTEM REMAINS HARMFUL REFRIGERANT TYPES OF GASES INCLUDING HYDROCHLORIC CARBONS MOST RECENTLY. THAT SOME OF YOU KNOW HERE IN THE U. S. AS SOME OF THE LOOTED IF YOU WERE STARTING ON AN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. OVER. FIFTEEN EARLY AND AMBITIOUS ACTION ON AGENCIES WAS AN INDISPENSABLE PART OF THIS EFFORT TO PASS NATIONAL EACH OF C. LEGISLATION AND HAS ALSO HELPED THE CLIMATE. OF DIRECTLY TO BOOT TWELVE ZERO SIX CARRIES THAT LEADERSHIP FORWARD PROPOSING MEASURES THAT HAVE JUST BEEN DESCRIBED AND ESSENTIALLY CALL ON THE INDUSTRY NOT TO GIVE UP HERE BUT RATHER TO KEEP INNOVATING CLIMATE FRIENDLIER HFC ALTERNATIVES. AND THAT'S CRISTINA JUST MENTIONED THE BILL ALSO INDIRECTLY ENCOURAGES A VAST EXPANSION IN THE INDUSTRY THAT RECLAIMS RECOVERS REUSES RECYCLES OLD HSCS FROM THE EXISTING STOCK WILL CLIENTS IS OUT THERE USING THEM. THIS IS A KEY STEP IN TODAY WERE MISSING THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT WITH THIS BILL WE TAKE A STEP TOWARDS MAKING THAT MORE PREDOMINANT OF A PRACTICE MORE COST EFFECTIVE. SEVERAL OTHER GOOD THINGS. THIS WILL ALSO HELP CUT EMISSIONS DIRECTLY THEY CAN'T SEE A MISSION BY THE WAY TWENTY NINETEEN RESTORED RIGHT CALIFORNIA I'M SO SORRY. AND VERY MUCH WE CONTINUE TO HAVE GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE THANKS VERY MUCH FOR HAVING. FANTASTIC THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY LET'S SEE IF IS. ANYONE HERE IN PERSON ONCE THE VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. PERSONAL COULD ALSO ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL ATTACKS COUNCIL INTO. THANK YOU- EXIT CHAU OF CAL AGAINST WASTE SINCE. THANK YOU. OKAY ANYONE THE PHONE LINES ONE OF OUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL SB TWELVE OH SIX. THE VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL PRESS ONE ZERO PLEASE WHAT A LINE ONE GOAL ONE IS CUTER. IS GOING TO ONCE LOCAL. THIS IS JOHN HANCOCK THREE THIRTY TWO ABOUT WITH THE- MUCH OF OUR WORK. ON FINE. WE. WELL SIX. HUNDRED PART THANK YOU ALLOWED NUMBER TWENTY TWO ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD WHAT. HELLO THIS IS WILL BRING HER THREE FIFTY AND WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE NEXT IN LINE ONE- LET THEM GO AHEAD. IS DAN CHANDLER WITH THREE FIFTY HUMBOLDT AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT. MISTER CHEROKEE WAS CLEAR THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL RIGHT- I KNOW WE HAVE DONNED KHAKI HERE TO- THE LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS. MAY PURSUE AN ARMY GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURR SAID DON KHAKI MCCUE CAP CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF AIR CONDITIONING HEATING AND REFRIGERATION INSTITUTE. I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BUT CERTAINLY CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR AND HER TEAM ON THE BILL I NOTABLY H. ARAI IS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PHASE DOWN HFC USE. ARE NOT ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA A BIT NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY HAVING WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH CAR THE LAST FW YEARS ON THEIR RULEMAKING PACKAGE FOR MOVING TO LOW GWP REFRIGERANTS. AS WELL AS WORKING VERY PROGRESSIVELY PROACTIVELY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO PASS THE IMAC TO CERTAINLY WE SUPPORT THE GOALS IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE TURN CONCERNS OF WORKABILITY ISSUES WITH THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. A WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH OF THE PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY UNDER THE CAR REGULATION WE ARE WORKING AND REALLY READY AS AN INDUSTRY TO MOVE TOWARDS THOSE LOWER GWP REFRIGERANTS. AND YET WE CANNOT DO SO DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE STTE HASN'T UPDATED STATES- BUILDING CODES TO INCORPORATE THE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR THOSE NEW LOW GWP REFRIGERANTS SO WE KNOW THE SENATORS CERTAINLY AWARE OF THIS ARE CERTAINLY DISCUSSING THAT WITH HER. AND SO THAT CAUSES A CONCERN WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALREADY MOVING THE BALL TOWARDS THESE A NEW ULTRA LOW VERY LOW GWP REFRIGERANT ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE NATURAL THOSE NATURAL OPTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ARE HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. AND REPRESENTS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN NOT TO MENTION THERE ARE NO SAFETY STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THOSE ALTERNATIVE AND NATURAL ULTRA LOW GWP REFRIGERANTS. AND IN CONTEXT OF THE ONES THAT ARE IN PROCESS AND WAITING TO BE ABLE TO USE NOW THOSE ARE ONLY MILDLY FLAMMABLE AND WERE UNABLE TO MOVE THOSE BUILDING STANDARDS FORWARD. ON THE ISSUE OF RE CLEAN H. REYES ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF RECLAIM I WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CARVE ON OF THE RECLAIM ASPECT OF. OUR THEIR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES TO THAT AND WE'RE STILL EXPLORING. AND TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES- ALL. AS A RELATES TO THE- ACTION UNDER AIM AT IT'S PUTTING HIM. A PHASE DOWN THAT'S- IN SOME MARKETS CONDITIONS THAT ARE CERTAINLY ARE DRIVING THE DEMAND FOR RECLAIM A BUT WE'RE NOWHERE IS A STATE CLOSE ENOUGH TO RE CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO. OUR SERVICE THE EQUIPMENT IT'S IN USE TODAY AND NOT JUST PRESENTS SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WORK ABILITY CHALLENGES IF WE WERE TO PUT A DATE CERTAIN BAN ON KIND OF FULL SALES OF HSCS. FOR THOSE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT TODAY THE CERTAINLY AGAIN H. RIGHT SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOALS AND DIRECTION WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND HER TEAM AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME A LEAVE IT THERE BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO VOICE. OPPOSITION ABOUT THE BILL. JENNIFER WROTE ON BEHALF OF JOHNSON CONTROLS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED MEMBER OF H. R. I. AN ECHO ARE CONCERNED THANK YOU JOHNSON CONTROL THAT'S IT OKAY SEE COMPANY. OKAY OKAY OUR PHONE LINES ANYONE WANT TO VOICE CONCERN OPPOSITION THE BILL ON THE PHONE LINES. THE PROPOSAL THE PHONE TO OPEN IT IN. PRESS ONE ZERO PLEASE. SURE WE DO HAVE ONE COMING UP IT'LL BE ONE MOMENT. ONE MOMENT SIR. AND TAKEN THE COMMITTEE IMMENSE. THE ONE NUMBER ONE FOUR EIGHT POINT ONE LITER OPEN. HI THIS IS ALLOCATED THE HEAT AND RECORD STREAMERS INTERNATIONAL OR THE WHOLESALERS OF A REFRIGERATOR AIR CONDITIONER PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT- WITH NUMBERS IN THE STATE. PHONE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER TO REPAIR EXISTING EQUIPMENT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SERVICE GASES IF THERE IS NO SERVICE YES MAIL BECAUSE THE LIMIT AMOUNT OF REQUIREMENTS INTRODUCED MENTIONED IT WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SERVICE THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT I'M HAPPY REPLACED WHERE A COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS HIGHER IN REPAIRABILITY. I THINK IN A- A VERY BAD IDEA. FOR US CALIFORNIA. OKAY ONE ARE MY FOLKS SAID- THIS IS OPPORTUNITY JUST TO VOICE SERVICE YOUR YOUR IN A PLACE TO ME TO- ANYONE LSE MATTER. MISTER CHEROKEE WAS CLEAR GREAT OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- LET'S GO TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTION SENATOR. WELL I THINK THE SENATOR FOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE BUT- HAS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AND WE'RE SETTING A GOAL- AND WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT. AVAILABILITY OF GASES IN THE GASES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THERE ARE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE FAR MORE FAMILIES ARE BUILDING CODES- THIS EMINDS ME OF THE MTV EVEN WE PUT MTV AND GASOLINE TO HELP THEIR QUALITY ACTUALLY DAMAGED OUR GROUND WATER AND SO- THIS WAS A LONG TIME AGO NOT HAPPEN SO I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON LIKE. HOW THIS IS ACTUALLY AN IMPLEMENT AND WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE I THINK THAT WE NEED I'M- THINKING WE NEED MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT. TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT. THE GOAL. CERTAINLY- PERMISSION ANSWER. I'M LIKE SO MANY THINGS WE CAN'T ALWAYS WE NEED TO SET GOALS WHICH CAN THEN HELP DRIVE MARKETS BUT IN THIS CASE THERE ARE ALREADY ON MANY OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE E. YOU HAVE SET THEIR STANDARDS FOR THESE LOWER GWP REFRIGERANTS AND THEY ARE USING THEM THEY'RE USING THE LEAST FLAMMABLE OF THEM NOT THE MOST BUT THEY ARE IN ALREADY IN APPLICATION IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES NOW. ON CLEARLY THERE WHILE I'M MOVING UP THE DATE IT IS STILL GIVING SOME TIME FOR NOT ONLY CAR BUT THE INDUSTRY TO FOR THE IF IT'S PARTLY IT SENDS THAT MESSAGE TO THE PRODUCERS AND THE RESEARCHERS AND DEVELOPERS. IN ORDER TO GET US THE OPTIMAL IN MOST SAFE ALTERNATIVES WHEN I THINK ABOUT YEARS AGO WHEN I CARRIED THE BILL FOR- UTILITY GRADE ENERGY STORAGE THERE WERE THERE WERE NO UTILITY GRADE BATTERIES. AND- IT'S CONNECTED TO OUR GRID STORING STORING OUR ELECTRICITY AND NOW WE DIDN'T HAVE OUR THE LEAD OF THE MARKET ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE BUT YOU KNOW I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE EXACT NUMBERS BUT ANYWAY SO. THE SO AT LEAST WE KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT SOME OF THESE LOW GWP ALTERNATIVE REFRIGERANTS ARE IN USE IN EUROPE- BUT WE DO HAVE TO GET CC TO FIX THEIR BUILDING CODES AND THEY OBVIOUSLY WILL BE LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE WANT SAFETY- AND- MY STAFF WE ARE WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY TO YOU KNOW TO LOOK AT WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO TWEAK TO MAKE IT. TO MAKE IT IS TO OPPOSE POSSIBLE AND IS SAFE AS POSSIBLE BUT THESE. ON NINETY TWO MAY HAVE THE COMMITTEE GO LONGER BUT- I STARTED WORKING I GOT INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS THROUGH THE OZONE DEPLETION ISSUE. AND WHEN THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL IS REGAINING NEGOTIATED BACK IN THE LATE EIGHTIES EIGHTY EIGHT AND EIGHTY NINE. AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE USING CFCS WHICH WERE FAR MORE DAMAGING AND WE WERE USING THEM IN ALL KINDS OF THINGS BESIDES YOUR CONDITIONING AND REFRIGERANTS AND A STAR FROM PRODUCTION IT'S WHAT LED ME TO BAN STYROFOAM. BECAUSE BASICALLY- BUT ANYWAY. WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IS. IN THE MONTROSE PRO WE PROMOTE HSCS BECAUSE THEY WERE LESS. DEPLETING THE OZONE LATER WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING HOW SERIOUS THEY WERE IN TERMS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE KNOWN THAT NOW FOR HOW MANY YEARS AGO WAS THAT THAT WAS SOME THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO WE'VE KNOWN THAT. FOR AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS SO WE'RE KIND OF BEHIND GIVEN HOW LONG WE'VE KNOWN THAT THEE H. FC'S HALF THIS DAMAGE SO WE NEED TO ACCELERATE OUR- OUR ABILITY TO GET THE ALTERNATIVES. INTO THE MARKETPLACE AND BEING UTILIZED SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO ON MY OWN TIME SO LOOK I WANT TO SEE IS. DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT WELL BUT AT THE SAME TIME- WE NOTICED IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE THE LEGISLATURE'S. APPROACH IS BEEN THE CARROT AND WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN IT. ON THIS GIVEN EXAMPLE WE WANT TO GO TO ELECTRIFICATION OF CARS. TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT. AND WE WANT TO GO WE WANT TO ALLOW THEIR THIRTY MILLION CARS IN CALIFORNIA. IN A MILLION NUMBER ELECTRIC. BUT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR GRID IS NOT THERE YET SO STRIVING THE COST OF FUEL UP. IN CALIFORNIA'S A LOT OF THESE THINGS DRIVE THE COST OF LIVING UP IN RIGHT NOW- IF YOU'VE NOT NOTICED THAT CALIFORNIA'S VERY EXPENSIVE PLACE TO LIVE IN IS BECAUSE WE ARE LEADING. ARE SUPPOSEDLY LEADING AND- A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS WHEN IT COMES TO. CLIMATE SO. AS A LEGISLATOR I'M TRYING TO BALANCE OUT. DO IS THE TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO DO THE JOB THAT WE WANT TO GET DONE. AND OUT OF AND THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO- MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY CAN AFFORD TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME SO WE DON'T DIVERT OUR- INDUSTRIES AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY. MAKE IT SO THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND- AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CAN ACTUALLY STAY ON CALIFORNIANS HAVE A IN THIS CASE IN THEIR LOCAL STORE THAT ACTUALLY DOESN'T DRIVE THE COST OF THEIR FOOD UP SO THOSE ARE THE BALANCES THAT ARE REALLY DIFFICULT IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M FRUSTRATED AT THE FACT THAT WE ALWAYS LOOK AT LIKE A WE JUST HAVE TO FORCE THEM TO DO IT. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO DO AND THE OTHER BILLS THAT WE SEE TODAY IS FORCING THEM TO DO IT AT THE SAME TIME THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THERE IT WOULD HAVE THE BUILDING INDUSTRY. WE DON'T HAVE THE REGULATIONS FOR THE BUILDING FOLKS ON THE SAME TO AND ALL THAT DOES IS DRIVE THE COST OF HOMES AND FOOD AND THINGS THAT WE NEED EVERY DAY UP WITHOUT I THINK WE'RE MOVING TOO FAST AND WE NEED TO STEP BACK SO FOR TODAY I'M GONNA NOT BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. INTEL WEEK MAYBE SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SEE HOW IT'S GONNA WORK AT THE END AND WHAT THE COST IS TO THE CONSUMER FOR. THE REDUCTION IN GHG ARE WE REALLY GETTING OUR VALUE THERE. THANK YOU. YEAH OKAY. SENATE BILL I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE ON THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE IN THE EXTREMELY HARD AREAS OF- IN LAND ORANGE COUNTY- THEY THINK THAT THEY COULDN'T RUN THEIR AIR CONDITIONERS BECAUSE THESE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE YEAH THAT. WOULD BE DEVASTATING AND SO THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS- NOBLE GOAL FINE NO QUESTION ON THAT BUT I THINK IT IS MOVING AWFULLY FAST AND TWO WE HAVE SCIENCE THEY'RE TELLING US THAT WE CAN GET THERE IN ODD I GUESS TO RECYCLE REFRIGERANTS. ARE REALLY GOING TO BE READILY AVAILABLE WITHOUT HAVING TO PURCHASE THEM OUT OF STATE FOR YOU KNOW VERY HIGH COST YOUR STARTING HIT HIT THE WHOLE ENERGY AREA AGAIN AND THAT IS PROBABLY THE HIGHEST COST. ALL RIGHT NOW FOR PEOPLE IN LOW INCOME AREAS SO- I JUST CIRCLE THAT TO A LITTLE MORE TIME IS NEEDED BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE GOAL ABSOLUTELY BUT TODAY I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD. IT HOPE YOU LICK IT AND MEHMET PERHAPS WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE- HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FRANKLY TO ALLOW. EXISTING IF THE BE RECYCLED REFRIGERANTS ARE AVAILABLE TO ALLOW SOME OF THOSE OLDER HOMES WITH THESE OLDER APPLIANCES TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE EXISTING ONES FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME IF THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THE- RECYCLED ONES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FUNDING TO THAT EFFECT. THAT COULD BE MONITORED. OKAY YES SIR I'M LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUT I ALSO WANT TO- THANK THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT- ALTERNATIVE REFRIGERANTS BILL IS HE- THE DEFINITION OF NEW VERY LOW GWP REFRIGERANT TECHNOLOGY ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE HEAT PUMPS A DON'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE THAT REFRIGERANT AT ALL AND SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A BURGEONING MARKET PLACE RIGHT NOW IN THAT SPACE TO PROVIDE BOTH COOLING AND HEATING SO PERHAPS IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU COULD. TALK ABOUT IT SEEMS LIKE- THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOESN'T NEED TO BE THAT MUCH MORE- STUDYING OR- OR- DELAY TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT COOLEY POSSIBLY REPLACE OUR BROKEN OLD COOLING SYSTEMS WITH BECAUSE- WE'RE DEPLOYING THE CDC RECOMMENDS I THINK SIX MILLION. HE COMES BEING AND INSTALLED IN CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY THIRTY. IF YOU LOOK AT IF THE CECE'S PLAN TAKES EFFECT AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOUR BILL TIMELINE IS STARTING TO TAKE EFFECT IN THEORY WE CAN HAVE- SOME REALLY EXCITING MARKET TRANSFORMATION SO. THE ONLY THING I WOULD JUST CAUTION IS- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE BEEN. TRYING TO NEGOTIATE AND WORK THROUGH- TIMELINES AND I SAW IN SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS FROM FROM COMMITTEE OR MAYBE FROM THE AUTHOR THAT- THERE'S GOING TO BE. DISCUSS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION DELAY AND A FEW OTHER SORT OF- DELAYED DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ALIGNMENT WITH FEDERAL ACTION I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTH I THINK WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT- TO GET THIS GOING I DON'T WANT TO SEE IS WAITING OUT TILL TWENTY THIRTY IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TO. DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORM HEATING COOLING SPACE IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL SECTORS NEED THIS BILL AND NEED SOME CHANGE SO- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORTH IN CUSTODY I JUST I AM. ALL IN ON HOW TO FLIRT CARBON GAS REDUCTIONS APPLIED THE OTHER AUTHOR PICKING UP ON WHAT CENTER STERNA SAID I'M WONDERING IF THE AIRPORT IS THE RIGHT AGENCY TO BE TO BE- PROMULGATING REGULATIONS ON THE TECHNOLOGY VERSUS THE C. E. C. AND I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- BECAUSE IT MAY BE. QUICKER THREE POINT. B. SO. YES THE SHIP- IN YOUR CLOTHES SHE HAS AN AFFECT ON THE BUILDING CODE ANYWAY COOL WE- FOR AGENCIES RESPOND AS APPROPRIATELY SO NUMBER THINGS UNLIKE SOME OF MY BILLS WHICH WERE AMBITIOUS IN NATURE INCLUDING GOALS FOR WHICH WE DID NOT YET HAVE THE TECHNOLOGIES IN COMMERCIAL APPLICATION IN THIS CASE THOSE LOADS THE W. P. REFRIGERANTS ARE IN USE THEY ARE NOT AS IN USE IN THE US BUT THEY ARE IN USE IN EUROPE. AND THE THIRD IN OUR DC ALEX- COULD HAVE. DONE SOME OF THE TECHNICAL EXPLANATIONS OF THAT STYLE BUT WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT WE CAN ALWAYS GET YOU THAT- IF NEEDED ADDITIONALLY THE MOVING UPDATE IS STILL TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THAT IS THIRTEEN YEARS FROM NOW SO WHILE THAT MAY SEEM SHORT IT'S NOT SHORTEN WE THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE THE LINK YOU KNOW WHEN THIS GOT INTRODUCED IN HOW YOU BIG TO IS IT IS OR THAT WE LOOK AT HOW- YOU KNOW VARIETY OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. NEW- YOUR IT AND SINCE WE SINCE THE WHOLE WORLD IS FOCUSED ON THIS CLAIM IT CRISIS AND THERE IS MUCH. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION UNDERWAY I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO MEET THIS- ADDITIONALLY THE IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYONE WHO HAS A CURRENT AIR CONDITIONER IN THEIR HOME TO GET RID OF THAT AIR CONDITIONER. OR YOU KNOW. NOT BE ABLE TO- REPLACE IF IT'S IF IT'S REFRIGERANT NEEDS REPLACEMENT FOR A GOOD WHILE AND BY THAT POINT. THE SHOULD BE VERY AVAILABLE NOW OR AT LEAST THEIR BE RECLAIMED MARKET SHOULD BE MUCH MORE VIBRANT- I WANTED TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THE AMENDMENTS ANSWER SEEMS TO BE A QUESTION. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN BOLD SO IN NUMBER FOUR IT'S THE REPLACING THE REFERENCES TO NATURAL ALTERNATIVES WITH ULTRA LOW GWP ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE A GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF LESS THAN TEN. IT IS THE- REMOVING THE SECTOR SPECIFIC REFERENCES- THE SUIT WOULD BE ALL SECTORS RATHER IN THAT SECTOR SPECIFIC REFERENCES. AND THEN THE REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE P. YOU SEE TO DEVELOP THE STRATEGY FOR INCLUDING LOW GWP. AND NOW TO REFRIGERANTS IN EQUIPMENT FUNDED BY THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM. SO THOSE ARE THE AMENDMENTS. AND WITH THAT FAST ZERO VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I'LL MOVE BY CENTER STERN THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION WE'RE GONNA FIGURE A BETTER WAY OF SIGNIFYING COMMITTEE MEN'S VERSUS OTHER MEN'S IN THE ANALYSIS GOING FORWARD. SO YOU ALSO INSPIRED CHANGE IN THAT RESPECT SENATOR. ASSERTED HIS FELLOW. I THE NUMBER THIRTEEN SB TWELVE OH SIX BY SENATOR SKINNER MOTIONS DO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN ALL RIGHT ALAN I BATES. BATES NO DALI DALI NO GOOD pSOLID. THE DALLAS AYE SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE STERN STERN HIGHWAY CASKEY MY CASKEY AYE. OKAY SO THAT BILLS OUT THANK YOU THOSE. THAT DON'T. SORRY THAT I MOVED UP BILL CENTER STRANDED OKAY YES AND STERN- CITY MOVIE WHEN APPROPRIATE OKAY LET'S GO TO CINEMA CASKEY WHO'S GOING TO PRESENT SB TWELVE FIFTY SIX. SO MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS A HALF OF. POUND CANISTER THAT'S- GIVE YOU GUYS OFFICIALS THIS MY BILL DEALS WITH THE SCEPTER CAMPING CANISTERS THAT FOLKS WILL DEAL WITH IN S. B. TWELVE- FIFTY SIX. JUST LIKE LATE LAST WEEK- WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES WHOSE A LARGE PRODUCER OF PROPANE CANISTERS REACHED OUT TO MY OFFICE AT WITH THE POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO THIS. BAND BILL WITHIN THAT EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY BILL- I HAVE HAD SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM IT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BILL- THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING IT DOES I THINK IT'S ME TO THE PROMISED LAND OR TWO IT'S ALL OF US TO WE WANT TO. BE IS THAT THESE ARE NOT THROWN INTO A GARBAGE AND AS SUCH AS STAFF REPORTS. NOTES CAN CAUSE A DAMAGE FIRES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I WILL BE HAPPY TO HAVE TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM- AND WITH THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE INSULT CONSULTANT AS THOSE THINGS GO ON. YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT BILL IN FRONT OF YOU RIGHT NOW- THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOU GUYS TO VOTE. FOR ON S. B. AT. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE THIS BILL DOES- BANNED THE USE OF THESE- PROPANE CYLINDERS. IT THE DESIGN IS TO HELP CALIFORNIA TRANSITION TO- YOU KNOW SAVE CONSUMERS MONEY IMPROVE OUR ENVIRONMENT- THERE'S- I THINK IN THE ABUNDANCE OF TIME- MISTER CHAIR I WON'T PASS. THE MY WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE TO- SPEAKING SUPPORT- AS THE COMMITTEE AS A SPECIAL MOVES THROUGH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS I SAID I WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU IN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ABREAST OF ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT THE BILL MIGHT TAKE I HAVE- CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL HERE- PRISCILLA. HI QUIROS TO A TEST TRANSPORT. MORE INJURE MEMBERS PERSECUTOR SOMETHING WHICH I YOUR INTEREST WILL CERTAINLY HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS WHICH COUNCIL WHO ARE PROUD SPONSORS OF SB TWELVE FIFTY SIX. I TWELVE FIFTY SIX WOULD BAN THE SALE OF APPROXIMATELY TWO POUND PROPANE CYLINDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE EXIT AND WILL TAKE EFFECT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TO ENSURE THAT THE EXISTING REFILLING AND EXCHANGE INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETPLACE KINETICALLY MEET DEMAND. BEFORE DISPOSABLES ARE COMPLETELY BANNED APPROX EVERY YEAR POSSIBLY FORTY MILLION A SINGLE USE TO POUND PRESLEY PROPANE CYLINDERSARE MANUFACTURED IN THE U. S. AND SOLD AN ESTIMATED. FOUR MILLION ARE IN CALIFORIA ALONE. AS ARE SUPPOSED MANAGED AS- HAZARDOUS WAY AND SO THEY'RE EMPTY. DISPOSED IMPROVEMENTS OR GARBAGE CANS OR THROWN AWAY AT LOCAL STATE PARKS AND FEDERAL PARKS AND BEACHES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NGUYEN IT COULD BE DESCRIBED IN THE TRASH ORIENT RECYCLING BUT IT'S DECEPTIVE. SINCE THERE'S NO BLEEDER OR BALLOTS TO COMPLETELY HOW THE CONSUMER OR THE WASTE OR RECYCLING FACILITIES JUST ENSURE THAT COMPLETELY. AND THIS MEANS THE TANKS OFTEN CONTAIN A SMALL AMOUNT OF GAS WHICH POSE A DANGER TO SANITATION WORKERS TO THE RISK OF EXPLOSIONS AND RESULTING IN FIRES. A NUMBER YEARS AGO AN EXPLOSION HAPPENED IN SUNNYVALE AS A RESULT OF ONE OF THESE CANISTERS- ALTHOUGH THE PROCEDURES DO POSE A FIRE HAZARD WE BELIEVE THE RISK IS MINIMAL- ARE STILL A WAYS. YOUR SYSTEMS ARE. LEGALLY OBLIGATED D'HIVER AND PROPERLY HANDLE THESE DISPOSABLE TANKS WHEN THEY'RE DETECTED THE COST OF DIVERTING PROPERLY AND BANISHING AND RECYCLING IS DISPOSABLE PROPANE TANKS. VERY CROSS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SOLID WASTE RECYCLING OPERATION CON- CONTRACTS ARE COMPLEX IT'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES. COMPARISON BUT SOME JURISDICTIONS PAY AS LITTLE AS TWO DOLLARS PER TANK AND SOME AS HIGH AS TWENTY FIVE. BUT OVERALL IT'S APPROXIMATELY THREE THREE DOLLARS PER TANK THESE DISPOSABLE PROPANE CYLINDERS HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR PARKS YOSEMITE CONSERVANCY HAS BEEN TRACKING THE NUMBER OF. AND TYPE OF SIZE OF THESE FUEL TANKS I COLLECTED THE STATE PARKS AND INTO A TWENTY NINETEEN ARTICLE FROM WASTE THREE SIXTY. THE CLAIM THAT THE PARK HAD COLLECTED FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TANKS PER YEAR. AS ONE OF ASSEMBLY SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES. AND FOCUS ON REDUCING IMPROPER DISPOSAL PROPANE TANKS. ARE IS THEY ARE PROMOTING THE USE OF REFILLABLE TANK SO WHEN YOU GO TO THESE NASH ASSEMBLY NATIONAL PARKS. YOU CAN ONLY PURCHASE A REFILLABLE PROPANE TANK AT THE PARK OF BANNING THE SALE THE PROPANE DISPOSABLE TANKS ARE WILL MOVE CONSUMERS TO MORE SUSTAINABILITY OPTION. FROM A WICKS PERSPECTIVE THIS BILL PROVIDES ACTUAL SOURCE REDUCTIONS. AND THEN FROM A FINANCE PERSPECTIVE THE BILL WILL SAVE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY GOVERNMENT MONEY. BECAUSE THEY WON'T HAVE TO SPEND MILLIONS DISPOSABLE CONTAIN AND WASTE. UP IN THE WASTE. AS A CENTERS STATED WE DIDN'T WITH THE WERE. LAW WEEK AND WE'RE OPEN TO HAVING A COME. OF WHAT EPR PROGRAM TO LOOK FOR THE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AN ADULT CLUB HERE WITH A CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS YOUR SHIP COUNSELORS HERE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. TRADE YEAH THAT KNOWS ABOUT THE PEER PROGRAMS OKAY. GOOD EXCELLENT I THANK YOU HOW ABOUT ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. YES OPPOSITION YEAH ME TOO YEAH THE KOREAN REPRESENTING CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT AWESOME THANK YOU. HI OKAY- PHONE LINES SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THIS IS A THIS IS SB TWELVE FIFTY SIX- PUBLIC ON THE PHONE. FOR THE FIRST. ONE ZERO FIVE. AFTER. THE LINE NUMBER SIXTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD.

I SHARE THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE EPR BELL- AND I'VE MET WITH MY- THE SPONSORS AND THEIR- WILLING TO SIT DOWN WORTHINGTON FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE DETAILS WE CAN MODIFY THEM SO YEAH I WOULD MIKE MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE. TO MOVE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I WILL COME BACK TO IT- THE COMMITTEE INTERFERE WITH AND WORK WITH DIGNITY AND WITH INCREDIBLE RESPECT YOUR CLIENT HIRED YOU ON THURSDAY NO I. NO AND YOU'RE A I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOUR ARGUMENTS AREN'T THAT DON'T DON'T HOW ARE YOU KNOW DON'T DON'T HAVE SOME VALIDITY AYE I GUESS ON MY THOUGHT HERE AND CERTAINLY IF THE COMMITTEE DISAGREES WE CAN GO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION BUT MY THOUGHT HERE IS THAT WE- MOVE FOR WITH THE BILL. BUT IT'S A V. AS THE VEHICLE FOR CONTINUED NEGOTIATIONS- AND IF IT IS DRAMATICALLY CHANGE WE CAN ALWAYS BRING IT BACK BUT- BUT BUT ULTIMATELY. HE'S HE'S TRYING TO ADDRESS OF. OF A PHENOMENON. AT WELL A LOT. OF I CAN TESTIFY AT THE BAN THEN I MEAN IT IT IT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A PHENOMENON I THINK NOW SAYS. RIGHTLY FRAME SYSTEM THAT IT'S OF. IT'S POSSIBLY A PROBLEMATIC WASTE- YOU KNOW WASTE PRODUCTS. PRODUCT IN IN WHEN HE ENTERS THE WASTE STREAM. I THINK IT'S BEEN MANAGED PRETTY WELL TODAY TO BE HONEST- I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANY SOLID EVIDENCE THAT IT AT. THAT THAT ONE POUND SOLDIERS BECAUSE BUYERS MEAN. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT PROPANE CYLINDERS MAYBE THE TWENTY POUNDERS ME THEY CAUSE FIRES. THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER AEROSOL CANS A LOT OF A LOT OF. OTHER CYLINDERS I SHOULD. I SEEN. BROKEN YOU. AND THERE'S- THINGS THAT ARE IN THE WASTE STREAM THAT CAN BE PUNCTURED AND CAUSE FIRES BUT- AND WE CAN DEAL WITH ALL THOSE IN THE PR BUT WHAT I CAN SAY FOR WORTHINGTON'S AT WORTHINGTON. IS ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE STORESHIP PROGRAM IN ONTARIO CANADA THAT I KNOW YOU BOTH HAVE SEEN OR YOU'VE BEEN UP THERE AT LEAST I AM. AND THEY ARE THAT THEY ARE THEY ARE- THERE'S A- BILL IN THE CONNECTICUT LEGISLATURE THAT'S RUNNING THROUGH. THEY'VE BEEN ACTIVELY SUPPORTING THAT'S GOING THROUGH WITH ALL THE STORESHIP PEOPLE AND ALL THE- AND THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME A LOT OF EXPERTS THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE. UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IS AN EXPERT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY DIDN'T RUN. THIS BILL IS A PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP BILL THEY RAN A VAN. INTO IF THEY WERE IF THEY WERE SERIOUS ABOUT. PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP THEY WOULD'VE WOULD REACHED OUT TO WORTHINGTON WHO IS THE INDUSTRY LEADER IN THIS SPACE. I WOULD HAVE SAID HEY. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ONE PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP INSTANTLY THROUGH NOT BEING AND THEY THEY- GET REALLY QUESTION. WHAT THE REAL MOTIVATION BY THEIR OWN SERVICES. THEY DIDN'T COME WITH PRODUCTS YOU SHOULD BEGIN WITH THE BEAR. THANKS TO GAIN MARKET SHARE FOR SOMEBODY. AND SO WE- THINK ABOUT THAT OKAY. LET'S LET'S CONTINUE WITH THE TESTIMONY BUT WE'RE GONNA ASK THE SENATOR DIRECTLY RESPOND TO THAT THAT ISSUE- SO ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO WHAT WAS CONCERNS WITH THE BILL WHO ARE HERE PRESENT ANYONE. ON THE PHONE LINES YOU WANT TO VOICE THE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE BILL'S SB TWELVE FIFTY SIX. HE WAS ARTICLE PUBLISHED FOR THE- FROM. ONE ZERO. THE STRUCTURE WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. OKAY GREAT ALL RIGHT SO LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WHAT WHAT'S ASK THE SENATOR- FIRST OF ALL TO DIRECTLY RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS AND I WILL GO TO SENATE ALTHOUGH EIGHT MEAN THAT THAT THAT THE SIMPLE ANSWERS SEVENTY. ON THE- IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW ARE THESE REFILLABLE PRODUCTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE- THEY'RE BEING USED IN. THEIR ADOPTING SO WE THOUGHT THAT THE ALTERNATIVE. THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO MOVE TO A WHOLE. HAVE WORTHINGTON CHANGE THEIR PRODUCT LINE AND HAVE THE RICH REFILL PULLS- PRODUCTS IN AND- NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT THE COST OF- THAT. HITS MUNICIPALITIES OR PEOPLE THAT JUST DON'T- PARTICIPATE IN THE AND APR PROGRAM IS THE ONLY PR FIRMS IN A PERFECT SO THAT WAS THAT WAS THINKING FREDDIE I MEAN DO YOU DO YOU ULTIMATELY ENVISION THIS AS ANY PR BILL. YEAH I MEAN I THINK IF IT'S AGAIN WE WILL HAVE TO SIT BACK WITH THE PEOPLE SO WHY DID YOU INITIALLY PROPOSED AS A BAND AS OPPOSED IN PURE AND SPIRIT YES. I MEAN SPIRIT YES IT SOUNDS IT SOUNDS GOOD I HAVEN'T SAT DOWN WITH THE RENEWABLE ADDICTS OF REFILLABLE PEOPLE AND SEE WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THAT THAT- STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. HI HELP BOTH OF THOSE WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME THAT ARE ALREADY USING REPORT FILLABLE HOW WOULD THEY FIT INTO THAT AND HOW WOULD PEOPLE BE CONFUSED OF SAYING I'M GONNA DROP IT INTO THE- PROGRAM OR NOT. I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW AS A SENIOR RESEARCHER- I'M INTRIGUED BY IT I'M- CLEAR CLEARLY- INTRIGUED BY IT AND THINKS IT MAY GET A CITY TO THE F. THIRTY DOLLARS. SO AS SOMEBODY WHO. USES THESE PRODUCTS A LOT ACTUALLY. AND YET THAT YOU CAN GO A MEAN. I CAN REVEAL THAT BALL RIGHT THERE FOR IF YOU LIKE ME TO I DON'T THERE'S A- A CONVERTER THAT YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR PROPANE TANK THERE WILL RECHARGE THAT. THAT ACTUAL THING EITHER THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT SO THERE IS THE ABILITY TO REFILL THOSE IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY THAT'S WHY DO IT- AND THERE'S A LOT OF. OPPORTUNITIES AFTER BUT FOR THIS BILL. WHY DON'T WE TAKE THE TIME AND JUST DO IT RIGHT WHAT WHAT'S THE URGENCY TODAY. TO SHELVE THIS THROUGH AND- AND DO A BAND WHEN WE CAN DO IT RIGHT AND ACTUALLY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE. THAT IS JUST LIKE THE- TWENTY FIVE POUND. PROPANE TANK THAT YOU USE ON YOUR R. V. THAT YOU GO YOU CAN GO TO. WALMART OR WHEREVER YOU CAN JUST EXCHANGE IT. AND IT'S FILLED AND IT'S THERE'S NO PROBLEM WHY DON'T WE DO IT THE RIGHT WAY INSTEAD OF JUST. CAUSING ALL THIS AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN WE WEEK FOR SOME REASON. THE LEGISLATURE. IS WORRIED ABOUT. OR THE LEGISLATORS WORRY ABOUT THEIR SEVENTEEN BILLS ON THE FILE AND WHAT THAT'S OUR JOB IS TO. TAKE THE TIME AND DO STUFF RIGHT WE DON'T EVER DO THAT AROUND WHAT WE DO IS WE TO SHOP STEP THROUGH. BECAUSE TODAY WE GOT TO GET IT DONE FOR SOME WHATEVER REASON. AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO. THE MANUFACTURERS NOT FAIR TO THE IN CONSUMER WHO DRIVES THE PRICE OF ALL THESE THINGS UP SO I WOULD ASK. THAT YOU. ALL THE BILL TODAY. AND GO BACK AND FIX THE BILL WE HAVE TIME TO DO IT. AND MAKE A GOOD BILL SO WE CAN ALL OF A SUPPORT IT AND DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND THE ENVIRONMENT THE SAME TIME. MISTER CHAIR. I FIVE. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THAT. THAT ALTERNATIVE I MEAN I'M- YOU KNOW I BROUGHT THIS BILL FOR BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED WITH- CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. RIGHT AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE. DEALT WITH IN ENVIRONMENTALLY PROPER WAY. THE BAND DOES DO THAT. I'M JUST. THE QUESTION IS THAT THE IS THE EPR ALTERNATIVE. MEET THE SAME GOALS THAT WE HAVE AND I'M- YOU KNOW I THINK IT DOES. BUT DO I KNOW FOR SURE FOR SURE THAT I HAVEN'T. YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THE OTHER ADVOCATES WILL SAY WELL WE PREFERRED THAT. AND THEN IT'S A DECISION THAT I HAVE TO MAKE IS THE AUTHOR. RIGHT IN THIS WILDERNESS CALLED ME. TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS AGO WITH THIS ALTERNATIVE. THAT THE DEBT YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT IT'S GREAT THE COOPERATION BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT AUTHORS. HAVE TO PIVOT IN SEVENTY TWO HOURS. AND SAY OH LET'S GO THIS WAY. NORMALLY THE ANALYSIS WAS ALREADY DONE. THEN CALL IT FOR WHAT IT IS IT'S A BAND IT'S NOT A FIX FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED. WE NEED TO DO IS BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT IS THE BILL DO IT BANS. SINGLE USE. TWO POUND. THEN CALLED IT IS IN RUN YOUR- THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PLACE RIGHT HERE. IS THAT WE DON'T DO GOOD WORK ON OUR BILLS BUT WE JUST SHUFFLING THROUGH BECAUSE- PROBABLY BEHIND IT IS SOME. ONE MANUFACTURER THAT'S GOING TO PROFIT FROM IT THAT'S THE REAL GOAL. WELL THAT'S- THAT'S NOT HER REAL GOAL AND IT IN THE IN. IN THE- IN THIS BODY OR IN THIS FIELD WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE SEIZE ONE USE OPTIONS THIS IS YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO THIS LABEL SAYS DO NOT REFILL THIS IS USE IT ONCE AND THROW IT AWAY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR THAT'S WHAT THE STAFF ANALYSIS HAS DONE THAT WAS PRETTY PREPARED FOR US. AND I WILL CLOSE AN **** AND URGENT HI FOLKS. IF IT DOESN'T GET OUT THEN I WILL OBVIOUSLY WE- WILL WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO A- TO IMPROVE IT. OKAY I MEAN I'M I'M I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOU MISTER MISTER AT TERMINUS BUT I GUESS I GUESS IT AND ANYONE ENGINE BE FAIRLY I MEAN MAKES DOING ITS JOB BUT- YOU KNOW THIS IS A- IS A- COMPANY THAT'S LISTED ON THE NYSE IN EITHER SOPHISTICATED FOLKS THIS BILLS AND- I'M OUT THERE FOR IT FOR SOME TIME THE ONLY JUST CAME IN- AND I DO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE AUTHOR- YOU KNOW. WE INCOMES OPPOSITION VERY LATE- AND HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO PROCEED I GUESS WHAT I WOULD ASK IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE A MAJOR CHANGE WE WOULD WANT TO. NOT ONLY WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY WANT TO PLAY A BIG ROLE IN HELPING TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AS YOU'VE DEVISED THE BILL BUT I ALSO ASK THAT YOU. REACH OUT TO AND CONSULT WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- WE CAN ALWAYS OF COURSE BRING IT BACK UP I THOUGHT I THOUGHT I SAID IN MY OPENING COMMENTS I WOULD BE FREE TO TALK TO. EVERYBODY HERE THE QUESTION IS THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THE COVR PROTOCOLS WE HAVE IS THAT IF I DON'T MOVE IT TO JUDICIARY AND WE DECIDED NO WE WANT TO KEEP IT AS A BAND. WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO BACK TO THE SECOND COMING RIGHT RESEARCH AND I'M IN MY AND MY ONE PUSHED BACK SENATE DOLLY IS IF YOU IF WE WERE TO. OPERATE IN A WAY WHERE OPPOSITION TO COME IN VERY LATE AND BRING A BRAND NEW IDEAS REALLY IN THE BILLS. AND THAT WOULD DELAY EVERY BILL THE PLACE TO BREAK DOWN EVERY EVERY- EVERY OPPOSITION GROUP WILL BE DEBT WILL BE USING THAT. WOULD BE UTILIZING THAT- THAT TECHNIQUE YOU ONCE AGAIN THIS IS NO DISRESPECT TO THE- TO THE. ADVOCATE HERE WELL I GUESS IF YOU'RE- OF BRIGHT PARTY I GET. I GET. OFF AS- DAVE. MY BILL COMES IN AND GETS KILLED SO. I THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S LEGIT THEY'RE USING OPPOSITION WHATEVER YOU'D OPPOSITION. THE IDEA IS TO DO LIKE OUR JOB THAT'S WHAT MY POINT WAS.

DOLLY DALY NOT VOTING GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ FIVE SKINNER SKINNER AYE STERN STERN HI MY COUNTY HI KELSEY I'D- I WE HAVE- ONE FIVE FOLKS IF YOU'RE SPEEDING UP FOR KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND LET'S MOVE TO THE LAST ITEM ON OUR CALENDAR S. B. TWELVE THIRTY TWO WHICH IS SOLID WASTE. PRODUCT'S LABELING BIODEGRADABLE BILITY CENTER GO AHEAD WE'VE ALREADY HEARD A NUMBER OF BILLS ON THE ON THE PLANT AND WASTE ISSUES I'M ALREADY EVEN THIS MORNING AND FOLKS KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN. WORKING ON THIS- AS WELL I'M- WE KNOW THAT IT'S HEARTENING STATISTICS RIGHT HUMANS HAVE CREATED EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION TONS OF PLASTIC IN THE WORLD TODAY IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION JUMBO JETS. I ROUGHLY EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS OF THIS WASTE ENDS UP IN OUR OCEANS EACH YEAR LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. OF PLASTIC PRODUCED EACH YEAR IS RECYCLED. IN MOST CASES THE MATERIAL THAT IS RECYCLED ACTUALLY DOWN CYCLE SO IT ENDS UP IN A LESS. HIGHER USE. I WALK CALIFORNIA HAS DONE MORE TO PROMOTE THE RECYCLABILITY OF SINGLE USE PLASTICS IN RECENT YEARS WE KNOW THE RECYCLING IS. NOT A CURE ALL NOT ONLY IS STRICTLY WITH IN SCOPE WITH WITH ONE AND FOR OF THE MOST RECYCLED ITEMS. WATER BOTTLES OF MANY OF US HAVE. AND SO MANY OF THESE ARE STILL IN JUST OF THE- OF THE HI- SO I. WE DO NEED TO PUSH. TO ENSURE THAT NOT. USING FOR A PACK. WHICH DESTINED FOR THE LANDFILL WE ALSO NEED TO OTHER OPTIONS WELL. SO WE USE AND REFILL. AS PERHAPS OF THE CAN. I BECOMING MORE POPULAR IN ITS THE BEST APPROACH FOR MANY- STAR FOR EXAMPLE. I JUST ANNOUNCE A MOVE TO REUSABLE CUPS WHICH IS VERY EXCITING AND BY SHIFTING ALL SINGLE USE ITEMS TO REVIEW WOULD BE- YOU THAT THAT THAT REALLY WOULD BE A CHALLENGE- BUT I TRANSITION TO WERE USED TO REFILL- AS- YOU KNOW WE KNOW IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. OVERNIGHT SO THIS BILL TAKES A LONGER VIEW OF THE PLASTICS CRISIS AND BEGINS TO CONTEMPLATE HOW TO MOVE TOWARDS. RENEWABLE SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES FOR SINGLE USE ITEMS THE BILL SEEKS TO SET A STANDARD. FOR MATERIAL THAT CAN TRULY BREAK DOWN IN THE ENVIRONMENT FULLY AND QUICKLY AS OPPOSED TO FAMILY PERSISTENT FOSSIL FUEL BASED PLASTICS. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT INNOVATIVE COMPANIES WORKING ON ALTERNATIVES TO SYNTHETIC. PLASTIC PRODUCTS ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR BENEFITS DIRECTLY TO ENVIRONMENTALLY MINDED CALIFORNIANS WHO WON AND OR IS IT RELIANCE ON SINGLE USE ITEMS THAT ARE. USED FOR JUST MINUTES BUT THEY LOST HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF YEARS ON OUR ENVIRONMENT NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT THESE ITMS ARE PRODUCTS. OF THE FOSSIL FUELS INDUSTRY IN THE THEIR PAYER NOT CONTRIBUTING TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THEIR PRODUCTION. TO THE BILL- IS ONCE AGAIN A WORK IN PROGRESS THERE'S NO STANDARD THAT WE CAN SIMPLY POINT TO. THAT WOULD ALLOW PRODUCERS TO ADVERTISE THEIR PRODUCT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SYNTHETIC PLASTIC. I IN FACT OUR VERNACULAR HIGHS NOT EVEN MATURE ENOUGH TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN FOSSIL FUEL BASED. EVER PERSISTENT PLASTIC AND OTHER RENEWABLE MATERIAL TYPES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. IF YOU ANYONE SINCE OUR VOLLEYBALL ABOUT PALMER FOLKS IN THE MANUFACTURERS ARE WORKING IN THAT SPACE. THE BILL. TALK YOUR EAR OFF ABOUT THAT. SO WE CAN SIMPLY RELY ON A COMPOSED. STAY FOR- FOR A FEW REASONS FOR ALL SUMMIT. ARE ARE- TECH. AND COMPOSTABLE. BUT THEY DID BIG THEY JUST COULDN'T MEET A HOME COMPOSTING. FOR BIODEGRADABLE STANDARD. IN FACT A MATERIAL THAT IS HOME COMPOSTABLE MAY NOT EVEN NEED TO STAND FOR SOMETHING. THE MOST BREAKDOWN IN MARINE ENVIRONMENTS- SO YOU KNOW I'M I'M BIG GIVE YOU GIVE YOU RIGHT AROUND YOURSELF AND THERE'S CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT MAY BE TECHNICALLY COMPOSABLE YOU'D NEVER LEAVE. ON YOUR ON YOUR- ON YOUR RANCH OUT THERE. I STRUGGLE THIS MYSELF WHEN I'M LOOKING AT MY ITEMS WHICH I PUT IN THE GREEN BIN WHAT I WHAT I USE IN OUR OWN HOME COMPOSTING. WHAT I THROW IN THE TRASH WHEN I PUT RECYCLING SENATORS INCREDIBLY CONFUSING SO WE'RE- COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO GET THIS RIGHT. THIS MEANS GETTING STANDARD RIGHT ALSO MEANS ENSURING THAT PROPER LABELING. SO THE CONSUMERS KNOW HOW THIS MATERIAL SHOULD BE HANDLED- AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE SO WITH ME TODAY I HAVE BEEN KOGAN FROM COVE. THAT'S ONE OF THE LEADING COMPANIES IN THIS SPACE IT CALIFORNIA NEVADA COMPANIES. IT'S WORKING IN THIS SPACE- AND- HE WANTS TO COME IN BEFORE WE GET TO MISTER COVANCE THAT TESTIMONY- I WANT TO BE SURE IF I HEARD. YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN SECTION FIVE THE SIX. OF US ACTUALLY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS YES. ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT. WITH THE CODE. THEY YOU GERMAN AND OF THIS COMMITTEE. I'M COOKING WITH CO WITH. A WATER BOTTLE MADE FOR NATURAL MATERIALS PH. WHICH IS FILED WITH AND EVERY NOT OF OUR WHERE SPONSOR OF SB FOUR. TO THERE'S A FLOATER GARBAGE PATCH FOR LARGER THE STATE. OFF COAST DEPENDENT AS COUNTRY TO STAND INCREASE IMPLY. LITTER WELL LAST WEEK EIGHTY PER OF INTO THE SAMPLE TO THE STUDY WERE TO HAVE. T. PAY. POLICY OF. CIRCULATE IN THEIR BLOOD. INDIVIDUALS ARE SOMETIMES BLAME FOR THIS MESS BUT THEY DID NOT DESIGNED NOR MANUFACTURER SINGLE USE PRODUCTS KNOWING THAT THEY ARE INDESTRUCTIBLE. NEARLY HALF THE PLASTIC WE PRODUCE A SINGLE USE. MEANWHILE RECYCLING STRUGGLES TO KEEP UP. IMAGINE THEY SET OUT TO REPLACE THESE PRODUCTS WITH SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING NATURAL THAT WOULD LEAVE AN INDELIBLE MARK ON OUR PLANET. IMAGINE THEY DIVE DEEP INTO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE- AND REALIZE THAT THERE A LARGE NUMBER OF NATIONAL HEROES THEY CAN BE HARNESSED. TO REPLACE PLASTIC CELLULOSE CHITIN PUBLIC ADDRESS THE- CANDIDATES OR PJ FOR SHORT. AND OTHERS. IMAGINE THAT YOU FIND THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ON THESE NATIONAL MATERIAL STRETCHES BACK MANY DECADES THAT THEY ARE TO USE THE WORDS OF REPORT PUBLISHED BY CAL RECYCLE. QUOTE EXCELLENT MATERIALS FOR PASSING APPLICATIONS THAT THEY ARE BIODEGRADABLE BOTH HOT INDUSTRIAL COMPOSTING CALLED MARINE ENVIRONMENTS. AS WELL AS IN OTHER ARABIC OR ANAEROBIC ENVIRONMENTS UNDER HOT OR COLD TEMPERATURES. THEY ARE SO BIODEGRADABLE THE MARINE BIODEGRADABLE EXTENDS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST USE THESE MATERIALS AS POSITIVE CONTROLS. FOR LABORATORY AND FIELD TESTS. IMAGINE THAT. PUTTING WILL TEAM OF. IN CALIFORNIA FUNDED BY FORWARD LOOKING INVESTORS WANT TO SEE BETTER LESS POLLUTED WORLD. TO LEARN HOW TO PROCESS THE NATURAL MATERIALS INTO FINISHED GOODS SO WE CAN START TO UNDO THE HARM CAUSED BY PLASTICS. IMAGINE THAT YOU MANUFACTURE THESE MATERIALS BY USING WASTE BYPRODUCTS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY GREENHOUSE GASES USED COOKING OIL. WASTE WATER DISCARDED TRENCHES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. CALIFORNIA IS HOME T SOME OF THE MOST CUTTING EDGE INNOVATORS AND TECHNOLOGY IN THIS SPACE. IMAGINE THAT YOU SUCCEED IN MAKING PRODUCTS FROM THESE NATURAL MATERIALS BOTTLES STRAWS CUTLERY PACKAGING FROM ETCETERA. WELL A LARGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WANT A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND HEALTHY FUTURE CLAMOR FOR ALTERNATIVES TO PLASTIC. NOW IMAGINE BEING TOLD IT IS ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY FOR LOOKING STATES IN THIS COUNTRY. FREE LABEL YOUR PRODUCT WITH AN EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS. IN A WAY IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THE TERM BIODEGRADABLE HAS BEEN MISUSED AND ABUSED BY UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS. NONETHELESS NOT ONLY CAN YOU NOT SAY THEIR PRODUCT IS BIODEGRADABLE. NATURE EVEN IF IT IS 1100% TRUE DEMONSTRABLE AND KNOWN TO SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS THE WORLD OVER. SB TWELVE THIRTY TO SIXTY CORRECT THIS. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO ALLOW REPLACEMENT TO PLASTIC PRODUCTS TO MARKET THEMSELVES ON THEIR MERITS. MORE SPECIFICALLY IT SEEKS TO ALLOW PRODUCTS TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE BIODEGRADABLE BY REQUIRING SPECIFIC EVIDENCE. THE MANUFACTURERS ARE USING NATURAL NONTOXIC AND MARINE DEGRADABLE MATERIALS INCLUDING ANY FILLERS AND ADDITIVES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE EXPERTS TO ENSURE THIS LEGISLATION LEAVES NO LOOPHOLES. NO OPEN DOOR AND GREENWASHING. WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH COMPOSTERS TO ENSURE THAT SUCH PRODUCTS ARE BIOLOGICALLY RECYCLED. AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN USED AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EVERY OTHER STAKEHOLDER. IN CALIFORNIA TO ENTER THIS LEGISLATION SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST. BUT WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE IT'S TIME FOR THE LAW TO CATCH UP TO THE SCIENCE. SB TWELVE THIRTY TWO IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO SET A GOLD STANDARD FOR THE TERM BIODEGRADABLE. AND IN SO DOING INCENTIVIZE THE GROWTH OF INDUSTRIES AND INNOVATIONS THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO ACHIEVING CIRCULAR ECONOMY. THANK YOU THANKS THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHERS HERE IN ROOM TWENTY ONE HUNDRED IN SUPPORT OF. S. B. TWELVE THIRTY TWO. SEEING NONE MODERATE LET'S GO TO THE- PHONE LINES ANYONE. IN SUPPORT OF S. B.

THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT. MOST WILL GO TRY AGAIN FOR LINE FIFTY SIX YOUR ONE DOUBLE AGAIN GO AHEAD PLEASE. AFTERNOON MICHAEL BAFFERT THE BRAND MIKKELI ON BEHALF REPUBLIC SERVICES WHAT IT WAS CLEAR OKAY LET'S SAID TURN TO OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE BRUCE MCCARTY. ON THE PHONE IS THERE ANYBODY HERE. COULD RESTRICT NINETY FIRST IS MISS MCCARTY ON THE PHONE. MODERATOR BRIGALOW A LOT OF OBJECT YEAH CHECKING NOW- ONE MOMENT WE'LL SEE. DO NOT SEE ANYBODY ON THE PHONE LINES AS THE HOST ONLY LISTENERS. OKAY ARE ANYBODY HERE IN THE TWEENER SO OKAY WANT TO COME FORWARD. GNASHING COMMITTEE MEMBERS NICK OFFICE OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL AS WRITTEN AND THAT IS LARGELY DUE TO THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS. WE WOULD HAVE CONCERNS WITH WITH- THE STANDARDS REFERENCED IN THE BILL BEING PUT BACK INTO STATUTE. THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF STATUTE A COUPLE YEARS AGO- BECAUSE THEY WERE WITHDRAWN FROM ASTM AND THEY WERE WITHDRAWN FROM ACM. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT REPRESENT REAL WORLD CONDITIONS. AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DONE A LOT OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES TO REALLY LEAD ON GREENWASHING. CLAIMS AND MARK ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETING CLAIMS. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE CALIFORNIA'S LIED OR WE HAVE ADOPTED I BELIEVE A HALF DOZEN BILLS LIMITING WHAT CAN BE CALLED. COMPOSTABLE BIODEGRADABLE MARINE BIODEGRADABLE AND THE SPECIFIC STANDARD WAS WITHDRAWN AND LEGISLATION A COUPLE YEARS AGO. FOR THAT REASON. I'M YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT. THIS IS NOT EIGHT EIGHT EASY ISSUE BECAUSE AS THE SPONSORS I MENTIONED- THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME- STANDARDS HERE. THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY STANDARDS THAT REALLY REFLECT REAL LIFE CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN CONSUMERS SEE THAT SOMETHING'S LABELS BY TWO GREAT OF ALL. THEY NOT ONLY INTERPRET AS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRODUCT THEY ALSO INTERPRET AS INSTRUCTION FOR WHAT BEEN TO PUT THE PRODUCT IN. AND CALIFORNIA COMPOSTERS DO NOT ACCEPT THESE MATERIALS CURRENTLY- BUT EVEN IF THEY DID WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY STANDARD IS NARROW IN SCOPE. TO- NOT ALLOW OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT PHD PRODUCTS FOR INSTANCE- TO BE LABELED WITH THESE TERMS. AND THEN BEYOND THE DIRECTION CONSUMERS IT'S ALSO MARKETING CLAIM RIGHT AT PEOPLE CHOOSE SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. IF THERE'S NO ACTIVE STANDARD THAT YOU CAN GO PASS OR FAIL. IT OPENS A HUGE LOOPHOLE FOR OTHER FOLKS ALSO USE THE SAME TERMINOLOGY. AND NOT A AND COMPETE WITH THE FOLKS FOR MAKING TRULY DEGRADABLE PRODUCTS. BUT I GIVEN THE SANDERS LEADERSHIP ON BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT- MARKETING AND PLASTICS ISSUES WE'RE SURE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU. OKAY I'M MODERATELY LET'S GO BACK TO THE PHONE LINES AND SEE IF MR MCCARTY HAS. RECKLESSLY APPEARED OR IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE THAT WOULD LIST. WHICH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. TWELVE THIRTY TWO. I MISS REGARDLESS SO AS NOT BERLIN OF THE SPEAKER LINE UNFORTUNATELY MISSED SHARE. OTHER OTHER OLD. OVER THE PHONE SHOULD BE WILL NOT SPEAK ON COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE DO HAVE LINE SEVENTY ONE IS FIRST IS GOING TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS BRUCE MANY ANI ON BEHALF OF THE BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCTS INSTITUTE MEMBERS AND CERTIFIED COMPOSTABLE PRODUCTS IN THE THIRD OF OCTOBER THIRTEEN THOUSAND. ITEMS THE NUMBER DANDER AND WITH THE LARGEST CERTIFIER IN NORTH AMERICA- AND IT'S PART OF THE BACKGROUND BPI WITH THE ORIGINAL SPONSORING TWO THOUSAND FOUR THAT THAT DETERMINES THE USE BIODEGRADABLE ONES GREENWASHING I HAVE WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO BAN THE USE OF THAT. OF THAT TERM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TECHNICALLY MEAN ANYTHING WHEN YOU APPLY SCIENCE TO. SO WITH THAT BACKGROUND THE WAY THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. IT REFERENCES AS WHAT CA DEBBIE TALK TO A WITHDRAWN STANDARD IN A IN A TEST METHOD. BUT NOT A SPECIFICATION. AND THE DIFFERENCE IS A SPECIFICATION GIVE YOU PASS FAIL- THE WITHDRAWN OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE AND A TEST MESSAGE ASSEMBLY TELLS YOU HOW TO CAST SOMETHING BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY BIODEGRADABLE WAS TAKEN OUT AS A AS A MARKETING TERM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING SCIENTIFICALLY. SPONSOR SAID THEY THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE A PRODUCT THAT WILL BIODEGRADE IN ANY ENVIRONMENT BUT IT WILL BIODEGRADE DIFFERENTLY IN A MARINE ENVIRONMENT VERSUS AN ARID DESERT ENVIRONMENT PERSONS YOU KNOW FORCING VIOLENT WITH WITH MOISTURE- AND SO WHAT THE BIO DEGRADABLE MEAN AND THAT'S- THAT'S WHAT BPI'S CONCERNED WITH. WE'VE. TRIED TO MAKE- SCIENTIFIC'S IN ANY AND USED TIME INTO PLAY. AFTER THE EIGHTH THROUGH. OSCAR THAT IT'S ESTABLISHED THE WHOLE COMPOSE SCARE. WE HAVE ONE WHAT. TO ALLOW THE USE OF THOSE TERMS WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. SO IN ITS CURRENT FORM UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO OPPOSE. OPPOSE THE BILL BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT SENATOR- IS ALWAYS WORKING TO IMPROVE THE AREA. AND WE HAVE A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SENATOR AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE IN ALL THESE AREAS BUT UNFORTUNATELY. IN ITS CURRENT FORM WE MUST OPPOSE. VERY GOOD.

AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS- JUST TO STRESS OUT THE REASONS THAT THE COMPOST COALITION OPPOSED TO THE BILL ARE REFERRED TO KNOWLEDGE OF FROM THE TWENTY FIRST OF THIS MONTH IT WAS A PRETTY REFERRED TO IN THE ANALYSIS. BUT IF THE FOLKS WANT TO READ THAT FUNDAMENTALLY WE AGREED THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY CASE METHOD IT'S A TESTAMENT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY FROM STANDARDS THOSE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN- IT'S DEBBIE FOR A LONG TIME AND WE WILL ALSO. SPONSOR OFFER AB TWELVE R. ONE KING LAST YEAR BUT SEEKS TO DO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING HOLD COMPOSED ABILITY STANDARDS TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARDS ARE SO WE DON'T CONTAMINATE A COMPOST DON'T CONTAMINATE OUR SOILS AND WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL- EFFECTIVELY CIRCUMVENTS A 12-1 PRODUCTS WHICH IS STILL UNDERWAY THANK YOU THOSE THINGS YOU MISTER ALONG WITH MOST OF THE- NEXT.

THIRD THEY'RE WRITTEN. DEFINITELY NEED TO BE. SOME CLARITY IN THIS IN THIS AREA AND I WANT TO JUST THIS. THE CENTER HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY IN THIS EARLY AND BROUGHT. MY FAMILY BROUGHT ME ALONG AND IN THE PROCESS AND I I'M JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IN CALIFORNIA I'M CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT GOES WHERE AND WHY BUT I'VE LEARNED A LOT. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BEING ON THIS COMMITTEE- BECAUSE OF YOUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS- MORE UNDERSTANDABLE FOR CALIFORNIA AND ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT- CRYSTAL GEYSER WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT IT DOES BOTTLED WATER AND I TOWARD THEIR PLAN AND- AND- MET MET WITH THE FRUSTRATIONS THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MEET THE DEFINITIONS. AND THEY WANT TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND THERE THEY HAVE A GREAT PRODUCT THEY'RE GOOD. IN THE AREA SO- I'LL BE WATCH I'LL BE WORKING WITH YOU ON THE BILL HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THERE TO WHERE WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION WE ACTUALLY HAVE A STANDARD THAT APPLIES ACROSS ALL BOARDS SO I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR WORKON THIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO. HELPING YOU ALONG THE WAY TO GET IT DONE. FARE IS SEEING THE WEATHER- CENTERS WHETHER IT'S OP OPTION A OPTION B. OR A NEW OPTION C. YOU MAY CLOSE CENTER. THERE'S A MOTION BY CENTER STERN I DO NOT- SENATE ALLEN YOU ADDRESS THIS A LITTLE BIT IN THE OPENING BUT- GIVEN THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN THAT WE- KNOW INTERVAL IN THE FACT ELIMINATED. THIS NOTION OF BIODEGRADE ABILITY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A STANDARD- AND I SEE THAT YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW THE TWO OPTIONS BUT WHAT GIVE ME SOME SENSE YOUR CONFIDENCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO- I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE DO NOT WANT SOMETHING CALLED BIODEGRADABLE THAT JUST BREAKS DOWN INTO LITTLE PIECES RIGHT RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT BUT I MEAN IN A WEIRD WAY LARGE PIECES OF PLASTIC IS TERRIBLE IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S AWFUL AND YET IT IT HAS LESS IMPACT ON THE- THE MARINE LIFE BECAUSE IT'S THE TINY PIECES OF PLASTIC THAT. THE MARINE ANIMALS INGEST IN THAT ARE- YOU KNOW SO DANGEROUS BUT IT'S ALSO NOW WE FOUND. THAT INCREASINGLY HUMANS WE ARE WE HAVE THESE- MICROPARTICLES ALL THROUGH US IN THE- SO I GUESS- I NEED A LITTLE MORE SHIRTS FOR ME TO HAVE A COMPATIBILITY ON- I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I WANT TO. SEE THAT. IT'S NOT CAN HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. RIGHT I MEAN REMEMBER WHAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON OUR THE- NON FOSSIL FUEL BASED- PRODUCTS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A GREAT ABILITY SO THESE ARE THESE ARE BIO BASED. PRODUCTS THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF MICROPLASTICS PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE- REFERENCING OKAY. BUT BUT BUT BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE PROBLEM I THINK IT'S BEEN DISCUSSES THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE A GOOD STANDARD- YOU KNOW AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL SORTS OF A PERSPECTIVES THAT WE CAN GET SOME FOR ME YOUR VOICE CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL RIGHT TO FIND A BETTER CENTER. AND WE'RE SEEKING TO SET THE STANDARD HERE- IT'S HARD IT'S TECHNICAL- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF SCIENCE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT THE VOTE NUMBER NOW TO BE ABLE TO TURN TO THE DIDN'T EXIST EVEN YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO- THAT WILL HELP TO GUIDE. IT IS HELPING A GUY THIS THIS THIS NEGOTIATION. BUT ONCE AGAIN WELCOME WELCOME YOUR PARTICIPATION. I KNOW YOU WORK IN THE SPACE TO. RIGHT SO I WHEN I READ THE THINGS ABOUT THE- THE SPECIFICS IN THE BILL SO IT DOES EXPLICITLY- PROHIBITS. A FOR EXAMPLE A PETROLEUM BASED PRODUCTS FROM BEING LABELED AS BIODEGRADABLE. THAT'S THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT'S- YEAH THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT'S REALLY WHERE I WANT TO GO WITH THIS. K. F. WITH THAT MADE SOME OF THOSE CLARIFICATIONS MAY BE NEEDED FOR THAT. YEAH THE FOCUS HERE IS ON THE BIOBASED. VERY. YEAH I KNOW PARA MEDIR OF PETROLEUM BASED PRODUCT WOULD NOT QUALIFY ABOUT MY BEST ANDERSON YEAH RIGHT OKAY YEAH OKAY- UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.
