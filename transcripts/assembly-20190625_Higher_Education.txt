NINE SB FOUR NINETY THREE SENATOR JACKSON WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. OF I AM PLEASED TO BRING TO YOU TODAY A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE CONTINUED. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM FOR OF WOMEN AS WELL AS MEN. TITLE NINE WHICH IS THE FEDERAL SEX EQUITY IN EDUCATION LAW. HAS BEEN VITAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS WOMEN AND MEN GIRLS AND BOYS AT EVERY GRADE LEVEL HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS IN ACADEMICS. AND AT ATHLETICS INCOME PURSUE AN EDUCATION. IN AN ENVIRONMENT SAFE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE. SADLY AND FRANKLY SOMEWHAT SHOCKINGLY SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE. IS IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS PERVASIVE. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CAMPUS CLIMATE SURVEY VALIDATION STUDY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. AN ESTIMATED 62% OF WOMEN AND EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ONE IN FIVE WOMEN AND ONE IN FOURTEEN MEN WILL EXPERIENCE OR HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT. ARE IN KICK IN COLLEGE. HOWEVER DUE TO THE UNDER REPORTING OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE THE RATES ARE LIKELY MUCH HIGHER. THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF AN ACADEMIC AN EPIDEMIC. IN OUR ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS THAT REALLY CALL FOR CULTURE CHANGE. TITLE NINE HAS BEEN A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN ADDRESSING. EQUITY INEQUITIES IN OUR COLLEGES IN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. I CALIFORNIA HAS LOOKED TO AND RELIED UPON TITLE NINE FOR DECADES. BUT WE'RE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED BY THE DISMANTLING OF TITLE NINE'S PROTECTIONS BY A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS EXPRESSED OPEN HOSTILITY TO THE SAFEGUARD TO PROVIDES. AN TO ADDRESSING GENDER BASED VIOLENCE IT HAS IN FACT ALREADY PROPOSED FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT ABSOLUTELY GOT TITLE NINE'S CRITIC CRITICAL PROTECTIONS. THIS MEASURE THEM. CODIFIES ADDITIONAL PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOLS TO FOLLOW TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW IS EFFECTUATE INCLUDING ADDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IN THE EDUCATION CODE DIRECTING ALL POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT FUNDAMENTAL PROCESS SEASON REQUIREMENTS REGARDING SEXUAL. ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION INCLUDING ADOPTING IN PUBLISHING GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES AND PROVIDING FOR PROMPTAND EQUITABLE RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS. AND FINALLY REQUIRING AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION WHEN IT FINDS ITS SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAS CREATED A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT TO ELIMINATE THAT HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. TO PREVENT ITS REOCCURRENCE AND ADDRESS ITS EFFECTS SO THAT ALL OUR STUDENTS ARE ASSURED OF A HEALTHY CLIMATE WITHIN WHICH TO LEARN AND THRIVE AND GET THE EDUCATION THAT WE ALL EXPECT AND WANT. THEM TO GET AND THAT THEY DESERVE SO I AM JOINED BY JESSICA STANDER OF THE EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES THE SPONSOR THE BILL. AS WELL AS A MILIEU WAGONER A STUDENT SURVIVOR [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA STENDER AND I'M AN ATTORNEY EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES PROUD BECAUSE SPONSOR OF US BEFORE. NINE THREE FOR OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS WE PRACTICE UNDER TITLE NINE AND RELATED FEDERAL AND STATE CIVIL RIGHTS ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS. EDUCATION CIVIL RIGHTS WERE ESTABLISHED TWO EGGS AND EXISTS TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS EDUCATION. SEXUAL HARASSMENT INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE IMPEDE THE STUDENTS ACCESS TO APPLE IS EDUCATION. BEYOND JUST CREATING PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM. AMPLE EVIDENCE SHOWS THE MAJORITY OF VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS ARE WOMEN AS WELL AS L. G. B. T. -- MINORITY AND OTHER UNDER HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. AS CENTER JACKSON NOTED EXISTING STATE AND FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX AS WELL AS OTHER CHARACTERISTICS IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS AND REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO TAKE PROMPT AND EQUITABLE -- RESPONSES WHEN THEY'RE AWARE OF SUCH RESIDENT THAT COULD IMPEDE STUDENTS ACQUITTAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION HOWEVER THERE'S INSUFFICIENT LARA GUIDANCE ON THE PROCESS SEES THAT SCHOOL SHOULD UNDERGO AND SHOULD TAKE WHEN THEY'RE RESPONDING TO THESE TYPES OF INCIDENTS. OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE SO THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT OUR STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TAKE ADEQUATE STEPS TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO THESE INCIDENTS. IT DELINEATES TRANSPARENT EQUITABLE PROCESS SEES THAT SCHOOLS MUST TAKE THAT COMPLY WITH EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW AS WELL AS GOVERNOR BROWN'S TASK FORCE CITY CONVENE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW SCHOOL SHOULD RESPOND TO THESE INCIDENTS. SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES TRAINING FOR SCHOOL OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND IMPARTIAL HEARING WHERE BOTH PARTIES ARE GIVEN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND WITNESSES BEFORE NEUTRAL AND OBJECTIVE DECISION MAKER. AND THAT PERSON IS SEPARATE FROM THE INVESTIGATORY -- DUTIES ARE SEPARATE FROM THE DID YOU TO COURT ADJUDICATORY DUTIES FINALLY A PROVIDE STUDENT PARTIES WITH THE RIGHT TO TO THE TO CONDUCT A LIVE -- CROSS EXAMINATION PURSUANT TO SAFEGUARD THAT WE'VE SEEN OUR NECESSARY IS ADVOCATES IN THIS REALM AND FINALLY AS I NOTED THESE PROVISIONS ARE A LOT ARE IN LINE WITH GOVERNOR BROWN'S TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS. BECAUSE AS BEFORE NINE THREE OUTLINES THE PROCESS SEES AT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION SHOULD TAKE TO RESPOND TO THESE TYPES OF INCIDENTS WE BELIEVE THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CIVIL RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED AND AND UP HELD IN THIS REALM. AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOW TURN IT OVER TO OUR US STUDENT WITNESS EMILY WAGNER TO PRESENT HER STORY. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB. FOUR NINETY THREE MY NAME'S EMILY WAGNER I'LL SOON BE A COLLEGE SENIOR IN CALIFORNIA I'M HISTORY EDUCATION MAJOR GEOGRAPHY MINOR AND MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S ROWING TEAM AT MY SCHOOL. DURING MY SOPHOMORE YEAR I WAS VERY BY A MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY'S FOOTBALL TEAM. I HAD THOUGHT I HAD A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN. MY SCHOOL IS A SMALL CAMPUS AND SINCE WE WERE BOTH ATHLETES. I OFTEN OTHER CROSSED PATHS WITH HIM AND HIS ROOMMATE WHO WAS THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED. GOING TO CALPERS BECAME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT -- MY COACH NOTICED I WAS OUT OF SORTS AND CALLED ME IN FOR A MEETING. I JUST CLOSER WOULD HAPPEN AND SHE CALLED THE DEAN OF STUDENTS. WHO IS ALSO IN CHARGE OF TITLE? NINE I WAS TERRIFIED TO REPORT THE RATE BECAUSE THE SCHOOL SO SMALL. AND THE UNIVERSITY HAS A HISTORY WITH SWEEPING SEXUAL ASSAULTS UNDER THE RUG. HOWEVER NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED ME FOR HOW BAD IT ACTUALLY WAS. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE TEAM WAS VERY VAGUE AND UNCLEAR ABOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES IN TIME LINES WERE NEVER FULLY EXPLAINED TO ME. THE TEAM SEEMED TO LACK TRAINING OFTEN MAKING INAPPROPRIATE STATEMENTS AND CONSTANTLY ASKING ME FOR HUGS. SHE FREQUENTLY BAD MATH BAD MOUTH ANOTHER STUDENT WHOM HE HAD ALSO ASSAULTED AND TOLD ME THAT IT WAS IN MY BEST INTEREST NOT TO ASSOCIATE WITH HER. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS I HAD TO POINT OUT TO THE DEAN THAT SHE WAS HANDLING THE MANNER IN IT UNPROFESSIONAL MANNER. WHEN AMERICA'S FRIENDS BECAUSE BEGAN THREATENING ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE DâN ASSURED ME THAT HE WAS ALSO HAVING A VERY HARD TIME WITH ALL OF IT? AND THAT HE HAD TO GO HOME EARLY FOR THE DAY. SHE PUT ME IN ANOTHER SURVIVOR AND A HOTEL FOR THE WEEKEND. AND TOLD US THAT WE'RE AND SAFE IN OUR HOMES WHICH MADE US FEAR FOR OUR LIVES EVERY DAY. THE SCHOOL ISSUED THREE NO CONTACT ORDERS BETWEEN MARY PERSONALLY AS WELL AS BETWEEN TO HIS FRIENDS IN THE HOOD BEEN THREATENING ME. THEY DIDN'T KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW HIS FRIENDS YET I HAD TO BE SUPER CAREFUL WHERE I WENT OR I COULD OTHERWISE RISK GETTING IN TROUBLE FOR BEING AROUND THEM. I COULDN'T LEAVE MY HOUSE MUCH. I NEVER MET THE INVESTIGATOR IN THE MATTER BECAUSE SHE WAS AND GERMAN BESSIE GATOR AND AS FAR AS I KNOW. SHE NEVER ACTUALLY CAME TO OUR CAMPUS. THE WAY MY UNIVERSITY HANDLED MY CASE IS SADLY NOT UNIQUE. THEY PAID NO MIND TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE CONSTANTLY ASKING ME. THREE LIVE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT DAYS OF MY LIFE. THE INVESTIGATOR RECALL ME DURING CLASS EXPECT ME TO TALK ABOUT THE RAPE RIGHT THEN AND THERE. TO SACRIFICE A LOT OF TIME THAT I WANTED TO SPEND ON SCHOOL WORK AND ROWING. TO READING LOTS OF LONG AND COMPLICATED DOCUMENTS THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS SENDING ME. I BECAME VERY DEPRESSED. I THIRD FALLING BEHIND IN MY CLASSES DUE TO THE TRAUMA OF THE RAPE. HOWEVER WHEN I REQUEST ACCOMMODATIONS THE DEAN WOULD NEVER SPONSORING. I'M A VERY PRIVATE PERSON AND IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO EXPLAIN THE EFFECT OF ASSAULTS ALL MY PROFESSORS. BUT THAT RESPONSIBILITY FALLS SOLELY ON MY SHOULDERS. THIS PAST FALL AFTER TO UNIVERSITY FINDINGS OF HIS RESPONSIBILITY. TO APPEALS AND MORE THAN FIVE EXTENSIONS IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT IF I DIDN'T SETTLE. THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO EXTEND THE INVESTIGATION FOREVER. I FELT LIKE THE SCHOOL WANTED TO CRUSH EVERY BIT OF FIGHT THAT I HAD LIVED. I'M HERE TODAY SO HOPEFULLY SURVIVORS WHO CHOOSE TO REPORT WILL NOT FACE THESE DIFFICULTIES. AND WON'T BE SCARED TO ATTEND THEIR OWN UNIVERSITIES AND SO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF TITLE. NINE WILL BE TRAINED TO RESPOND TO REST MEN AND ASSAULT. STUDENTS AT THE MOST VULNERABLE AND TERRIFIED DESERVE THIS. FOR THESE REASONS I SUPPORT SP. FOUR NINETY THREE THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FOR SURVIVORS [inaudible] THANK YOU.

THAT SEEKS TO HAVE MORE FAIR PROCEDURES ENTITLED MY PROCEEDINGS. WE HAVE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN THAT HAVE COME TO US DUE TO UNFAIR PROCEDURES -- I WE GENERALLY SUPPORT THE BILL BUT WE HAD TO SAY WE HAVE POSTED. TO THE STATE ON THE ON THE ANALYSIS BUT WE GENERALLY SUPPORT IT BUT WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF VERY VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS. BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED FAMILIES HAVE COME TO US. OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS. THE FIRST ONE IS THE TRAUMA INFORMED HEARINGS. ACCORDING TO THE BILL IT SAYS THAT -- HEARINGS ARE TO BE TRAUMA INFORMED AND INVESTIGATIONS ARE TO BE TRAUMA INFORMED. COMMON FORM THEORIES WERE DEVELOPED AS A COUNSELING TECHNIQUE AN INTERVIEW TECHNIQUE TO HELP VICTIMS NOT BE INTIMIDATED AND RECOGNIZE A BE ABLE TO REMEMBER OR FAX. AND IT'S PERFECT FOR THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE USED. FOR PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD AS VICTIMS SHOULD NOT BE GRILLED SHOULD NOT BE INTIMIDATED. IT HELPS THEIR MEMORY IF THEY'RE ALLOWED TO STE RECOUNT THEIR EXPERIENCES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE MISS SUPPLYING TRAUMA INFORMED THEORIES AND USING THEM TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE THE DATED FOR SIX MONTHS THEY BREAK UP AND LATER ONE FILES A CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER. AND THE AND THE INCIDENT WAS HALFWAY THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE THAT RELATIONSHIP. AND THE PERSON WHO'S ACCUSED WILL SAY WELL WAIT A MINUTE YOU KNOW WE HAD THIS ONGOING RELATIONSHIP FOR THREE MORE MONTHS IT SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS HAPPIER HE WAS HAPPY SOMETIMES. AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH -- YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS GREAT. THE INVESTIGATOR WILL SAY TO THAT PERSON THE ACCUSED THAT'S A RELEVANT. WE DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT BECAUSE THAT CAN BE THE RESULT OF TRAUMATIC BEHAVIOR. PEOPLE THAT ARE VICTIMS ACT AND GIVE INCONSISTENT STORIES. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT ISN'T THAT THAT ISN'T A POSSIBILITY YES IT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEBODY TRAUMATIZED MIGHT TELL INCONSISTENT STORIES OR BEHAVE INCONSISTENTLY. THE PROBLEM IS IT'S A QUESTION OF FACT FOR THE DECISION MAKER IT'S NOT EVIDENCE TO BE EXCLUDED AND WE HAVE CAL AT LEAST ONE CALIFORNIA CASE DIRECTLY ON THIS POINT WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL CASES ACROSS UNITED STATES DIRECTLY ON THIS POINT. THE CALIFORNIA CASE SAY THAT THE TRADE THEY WEREN'T PROPERLY TRAIN BECAUSE THEY WERE TRAINED IN THE TRAUMA AND FOR METHODS. THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE THE SECOND ISSUE AND I HAVE TO THANK CENTER JACKSON FOR ADDING CROSS EXAMINATION TO THE TO THE BILL BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT STILL HAS TO BE DONE. ACCORDING TO THE BILL THROUGH WRITTEN QUESTIONS PER NEUTRAL INVESTIGATOR I'M ERE TO TELL YOU THERE IS NO NEUTRAL SCHOOL OFFICIAL. EVER BECAUSE THAT PERSON OWES AN OBLIGATION HAS A LEGAL DUTY TO PROTECT THE STUDENT THEIR QUESTIONING. WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND WE SEE THIS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME? IS THAT THE PERSON ASSIGNED WITH ASKING QUESTIONS DOES NOT ASK THEM REWARDS THEM TRIES TO SOFTEN THEM. AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF AN EFFECTIVE. ODD QUESTIONING OF THE WITNESSES AS A ROUTE JUST WANNA REMIND THE THE WITNESSES HERE THAT THANK YOU YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES TOTAL SORRY OKAY. OTHERS IN UP YOUR OTHER PERSON SO I'M SORRY OKAY I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. ACROSS EXAMEN EXAMINATION HAS TO BE FLEXIBLE IT CAN'T BE SCRIPTED AND HAVING SOMEBODY IN ANOTHER ROOM AVAILABLE BY VIDEO FEED WILL MINIMIZE ANY TRAUMA. HI MY NAME IS KIM JONES THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY -- I'M OF THE MOM OF THREE KIDS TWO BOYS AND A GIRL. NEVER DREAMT TO THAT WHEN I SENT MY SON OFF TO COLLEGE THAT HE WOULD BE THE ONE I WOULD NEED TO WORRY ABOUT MOST I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT MY DAUGHTER -- LISTENING TO THE YOUNG GIRL TELL HER STORY WAS VERY MUCH THE STORY. SIMILAR TO MY SONS BEING FALSELY ACCUSED OF SOMETHING HE DID NOT -- TO HE WAS NEVER TOLD OF HIS ALLEGATIONS HE HAD TO SHOW UP AND COME TO THESE HEARINGS HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO WALK FOR GRADUATION THERE WAS NO RULING THAT WAS MADE HE DIDN'T THAT HE NEVER HAD A HEARING HE WAS TOLD HE WOULD HAVE. A FAIR HEARING THAT NEVER HAPPENED -- HE WAS FOUND RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT HE KISSED A GIRL -- HE WAS EXPELLED FROM THE CSU SYSTEM NEVER WELCOME BACK AND WE APPEALED AND ULTIMATELY FILED A LAWSUIT. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE WON BECAUSE WE FINALLY HAD SOMEBODY WHO WAS. A THIRD NEUTRAL PARTY THAT WOULD HEAR US AND LOOK AT THE FACTS AS THEY WERE AND LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU YOU KNOW THAT YES IT NEEDS TO BE FAIR IT NEEDS TO BE UNBIASED FOR ALL PARTIES. ABSOLUTELY AND THERE'S THERE IT YOU KNOW. YOU NEED TO THINK OF THEM AS WELL [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU TO GIVE YOUR NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION THAT YOU'RE WITH. MY NAME IS MICHELLE JACQUELINE AND MY ORGANIZATION IS RESPECT LIFE FOR ALL. I AM IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING REFERRING TO CONCRETE EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE SOMEONE AND THIS IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME. THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN WHEN THEY'RE IN A SITUATION THE UP OF VULNERABILITY THEY'VE BEEN DRINKING ALCOHOL AND ALL GOING. TO UC'S LAST WITNESSES OR JUST YOUR NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION YOU'RE WITH THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY ANY WINNERS. PLEASE COME UP. A GOOD AFTERNOON ENTER MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY I WANT TO THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR FOR SPENDING NUMEROUS HOURS WITH US. AS WE WORK TO THE CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH THE BILL -- WE MADE A LOG PROGRESS ON OUR CONCERNS -- THERE ARE A COUPLE ISSUES OF CONCERN THEY THEY'RE PROBABLY MORE PRUDENT TO BE DRESSED IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAN THIS COMMITTEE HAVE. SPECIFICALLY RIGHT OF ACTION -- BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE THE DIALOGUE THAT YOU HAVE -- YOU PROVIDED TO OUR OFFICE -- WE'VE MET NUMEROUS TIMES DURING. THE SENATE AND THIS HEARING RICHARD LOOKING FOR TO SPEAK TO THE SCOTTISH IS THE FUTURE. GOOD AFTERNOON ALEX CRAZY ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES AS ONE ECHO -- WHAT MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUES SAID ABOUT -- EXTENDING THANKS TO THE AUTHORS STAFF IN THE SPONSORS FOR ME WITH US MULTIPLE HOURS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES IS MOVES FOR AND ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK THAT THE STUDENTS SURVIVOR FOR COMING FORWARD. THANK YOU AND IF OTHER TWEETERS WOULD JUST GIVE THEIR NAME AND THE GROUP THERE WITH. JUSTIN SELLING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE THE CHANCES OFFICE NO FORMAL POSITION BUT WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. PRIME MACLAINE YOU THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE A OF CALIFORNIA AND WE AT ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OPEN SAID BY MY COLLEAGUES [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. BACK TO ROME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND UP WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND I WANTED TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IN THIS IMPORTANT AND SENSIBLE MEASURE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. I WAS MOVED BY THE TESTIMONY FROM THE STUDENT AND IF YOU CAN CONVEY. THAT OUR WORDS IMPACTED MANY OF US AND NEED TO BE HEARD. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE AND I'M ENCOURAGED THAT THIS BILL DOES JUST THAT AND WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT IT WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. US SENATOR JACKSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU BRIEFLY -- AND I DO WANT. TO THANK OUR WITNESS. WE'VE HEARD THAT STORY MANY TIMES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGHOUT THE NATION. AND I BROUGHT THIS BILL BECAUSE I AM BOTH HORRIFIED BY THE PREVALENCE OF THIS SITUATION. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A FAIR AND EQUITABLE PROCESS. AS A RECOVERING LAWYER I AM COMMITTED TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW FOR BOTH THE ACCUSED. AND FOR THE VICTIM AND I'M I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THOSE. WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FALSE ALLEGATIONS I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER? THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING THIS IS A SCHOOL MISCONDUCT PROCEEDING SO IT ISN'T A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING -- IN FACT VERY FEW WOMEN COME FORWARD. TO IT TO DO THESE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS -- BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR THAT THE PROCESS WILL BE SIMILAR TO WHAT THIS YOUNG WOMAN EXPERIENCED THERE ARE -- ALLEGED PERPETRATORS WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY OR OUR ACTIONS A STARKLY IN SOME INSTANCES WHICH I THINK WAS REFLECTED BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESS HERE TODAY. PREVIOUSLY WHERE THE SYSTEMS DIDN'T WORK FOR EITHER PARTY. AND THIS BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE THAT THAT BALANCE OF DUE PROCESS RECOGNIZING THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS FOR ALL SCHOOLS TO FALL -- YOU KNOW SCHOOLS ARE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THEY'RE NOT COURTS OF LAW PER SE WHAT THEY NEED IS THEY NEED TO HAVE A SENSITIVITY TO THE ISSUES. THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A HEARING MECHANISM SO THAT -- THAT EACH PARTY WILL HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD AND THE NEED TO THOSE PARTIES BE PROTECTED -- WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN VICTIMIZED -- THIS CAN BE A HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE AND WE KNOW HISTORICALLY OVER TIME THAT SCHOOLS HAVE HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TONE DEAF. OR THEY'VE BEEN INADEQUATE THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN HOW TO PROPERLY DO THISWE WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CROSS EXAMINE THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE DUE PROCESS -- SYSTEM SHOULDBE AND SO GOING FORWARD -- TO WHEN IT CONTINUE WORKING. WITH EVERYONE HERE IS MENTIONED I'VE CONVENE MEETINGS -- TITLE NINE IN ORDER FOR IT TO MEET ITS EXPECTATION HATCH TO PROVIDE EQUITY FOR ALL STUDENTS AND WE TOOK A LOT OF THIS -- FROM WHAT WAS THAT THEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SPENT TWO YEARS WORKING. ON A PROCESS THAT WOULD BE MORE FAIR -- THE GOVERNOR PRESENTED SOME OPTIONS WHEN HE VETOED THIS BILL SAID I'D LIKE TO LOOK INTO THIS FURTHER WE TOOK ALMOST ALL OF THOSE RECOMMENDATION A COUPLE WE TWEAKED A LITTLE BIT -- AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO TRY TO GET TO RESOLUTION THAT WILL PROTECT VICTIMS IT WILL PROTECT THOSE ACCUSED BUT IT WILL ULTIMATELY DO JUSTICE FOR THE STUDENTS AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE -- THANK THE WHEN IT THANK SENATOR JACKSON FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE -- FOR IT BIG KNOWLEDGE OF YOU'VE BEEN A LONG TIME CHAPLAIN AS OF SEXUAL EQUITY. BEING ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL I SUPPORTED SB SIXTEEN SIX ONE SIXTY NINE LAST YEAR AND WAS SUPPORT AS BEFORE. NINETY THREE THIS YEAR -- ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT I WAS PART OF THE HEARINGS I THINK IT'S SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WERE UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- BOTH AT UCLA UC SANTA BARBARA ON THIS TOPIC AS WELL.

UP [inaudible] DOCTOR PAN. PLEASE COME FORWARD AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO START WITH ITEM FOUR SB TWO NINETY SEVEN HAVE A WELL THEN WHY DID YOU WAITING ALL RIGHT [inaudible] BEGIN. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. FOR DECADES SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE STRUGGLE TO MEET SUMMER CONSTRUCTION DEADLINES. ED OF STUDENTS ARRIVING FOR CLASSES IN THE FALL. OFTEN RESULTING IN COSTS THE LAYS AND DISPLAY STUDENTS. THE FIRST WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS OF CONTRACT ACTIVITY. UNDER NEWLY AWARDED CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR FOCUSED ON THE PRELIMINARY WORK. OF AWARDING SUBCONTRACTS MAKING SHOP DRAWINGS NORDIC MATERIALS. THE AUTHORITY TO AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS PRIOR TO STATE ARCHITECT APPROVAL CURLY EXISTS FOR DESIGN BUILD PROJECTS AND FOR K. TO TWELVE LEASE LEASEBACK PROJECTS. BUT NOT FOR COMPETITIVELY BID PROJECTS. THIS BILL SB TWO NINETY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT TO WARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. BUT NOT PERFORM CONSTRUCTION WHEN DECIDE NOT PERFORMANCE CONSTRUCTION PRIOR TO RECEIVING PLAN APPROVAL FROM THE STATE ARCHITECT. THAT'S STREAMLINING SUMMER CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. SB TWO NINETY SEVEN ALSO ALLOWS COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICTS TO AVOID COSTLY DELAYS FOR MAINTAINING STUDENT SAFETY. IS PROVIDED BY THE FIELD ACT. SB TWO NINETY SEVEN SUPPORTED BY SCHOOL FACILITY PROFESSIONALS IN CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES WHAT CO TO FIGHT CODIFY LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION. MADE BY TASK FORCE COMMISSION BY THE DIVISION OF STATE ARCHITECT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS OPPOSITION FROM CONTRACTOR LABOR GROUPS IN MY OFFICE IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS. OPPOSITION IN SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION DEPUTE DISPUTES AND CHANGE ORDERS. TODAY I AM PLEASED TO HAVE WITH ME DAVID TALENT OF THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS SPEAKING SORE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IN THE ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. EXPECT THE ASPIRIN I THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR -- SUPPORT WITNESSES. HELLO AB MY NAME'S DICK CALLAN WITH THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS I WAS ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF THE TAX TASK FORCE THAT -- DOCTOR PAN -- MENTIONED AND THE STATE ARCHITECT -- HAS IMPLEMENTED OUR TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS AND NOW DOCTOR PAN THAT BRINGS TO A BILL FOR THE LAST ITEM WHICH REQUIRES A CHANGE TO THE FIELD BACK. FROM THE MANY PROJECTS DESIGN BUILD AND LEASE BACK THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS HAVE HAD I'VE HEARD OF NO ISSUES WITH MANAGING THE EXPECTATION THAT THERE WILL BE SOME DE SA. STATE ARCHITECT CHANGES TO PLANS ONCE THEY'RE APPROVED BUT THE BENEFITS GAINED FROM BEING [E TO ORDER MATERIALS AND HAVE THEM STAGE. FOR THESE EVER A SHORTER WINDOWS OF VACATION TIME IN SCHOOL I THINK FAR OUTWEIGH THE RISKS -- THIS IS A SPECIAL TOOL I DON'T THINK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WILL WANT NEED TO USE THIS ON EVERY ONE OF THEIR HARD BID PROJECTS PROBABLY ONE IN -- TEN AND I TRUST THOSE DISTRICTS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ARCHITECTS IN MY FORTY YEARS OF BEING A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR WITH THEM. I FIND THEM TO BE WELL QUALIFIED COMPETENT AND CAREFUL AS THEY PREPARE THEIR BID DOCKS AND THEIR CONTRACTS. QUITE FRANKLY IF THEY AREN'T FAIR TO CONTRACTORS THEY DON'T GET GOOD BITS AND IN THIS CLIMATE GETTING GOOD BIDS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THEM. I AGREE WITH DOCTOR PAN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY GROUPS VIEWS ARE NOT REALLY VERY FAR APART I'M SURE WE CAN GET LANGUAGE. AT TO GET THEM TOGETHER THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. ANY SUPPORT MRS. ORTIZ. I DAMON CONKLIN WITH -- SEGMENT ORIGINAL BUILDERS EXCHANGE ON BEHALF OF OUR ELEVEN HUNDRED MEMBER COMPANIES REPRESENTING GENERAL CONTRACTORS -- WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. REGISTER CLING ON BEHALF OF THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. EMP DEAL WITH THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING AND SUPPORT. MARC CHRISTIAN WITH THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS CALIFORNIA SUPPORT OF AN CONCEPT WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON THOSE ISSUES -- DON'T FINANCIAL RISK. OKAY ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES. FROM FOUR TO THE FRONT DESK. AS YOU HEAD OF HEARD WHEN AGO WE HAVE A FULL MINUTES. IN COMBINATION. IN A SPLIT YOUR TIME. SCOTT GOVERNOR HALF OF THE CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE LARGEST UNIONIZED GENERAL CONTRACTORS IN THE STATE WE DO ABOUT. 5060% OF ALL THE SCHOOLS IN STATE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SENATOR TO ADDRESS CONCERNS REGARDING LIABILITY WHICH IS ALWAYS OUR NUMBER ONE ISSUE. THE NOTION OF AWARDING A CONTRACT BEFORE THE PLANS HAVE BEEN APPROVED. IT'S A LITTLE SCARY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BECAUSE THE STATE ARCHITECT WILL INVARIABLY MAKE CHANGES. THEN THE QUESTION IS WHO'S ON THE HOOK FOR THOSE CHANGES -- YOU KNOW THERE'S CONCERN THAT DISTRICTS WILL TRY AND PASS THAT LIABILITY ON TO CONTRACTORS. WHICH SHOULD BE PERILOUS FOR US. SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IF THE DISTRICT ELECTS TO USE THIS METHOD. THAT. ANY CHANGES REQUIRED BY DSA WOULD FALL BACK ON TO THE DISTRICT BECAUSE THEY ELECTED TO DO IT THIS WAY. THERE'S ALSO A THE SUPREME COURT CASE IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS OLD CALLED SPEARING THAT'S A PART OF THE SPEAR AND DOCTOR AND WHICH REQUIRES -- PUBLIC AGENCIES TO WARRANT PLANS THIS CREATE SOME CONFUSION THERE IF YOU ARE KNOWINGLY ISSUING. INCOMPLETE PLANS WE'VE ACTUALLY CODIFIED THE SPEAR AND DOCTOR IN CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SO THIS CREATE SOME CONFUSION THERE AGAIN LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR BUT THESE ARE PIVOTAL ISSUES FOR THE INDUSTRY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BRETT BERYL WITH UNITED CONTRACTORS THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE NATIONAL UNDER CONTRACT ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE THE PLAN HE PIPING INDUSTRY. AND THE WESTERN WALL AND CEILING ALLIANCE AND WE'RE ALSO HERE IN OPPOSITION BUT WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- TO CORRECT THESE ISSUES AND I JUST WANNA AMIR WHAT MY COUNTERPART IS CA HAS SAID THIS THIS AFTERNOON SO THANK YOU. CAN YOU ELABORATE THE EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CHANGE HOW YOU. AMENDED IT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE AMENDMENTS THAT PUT THE ONUS ON THE THE DISTRICTS BECAUSE LIKE MUCH LIKE SCOTT MR GOVERNOR HAS SAID -- WHEN YOU ALLOW CONTRACTS TO BE ISSUED PRIOR TO THE PLANS BEING FINALIZED YOU DO RUN A SEARCH YOU RUN INTO CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THOSE WOULD NEGATE THOSE WOULD NECESSITATE CHANGES TO BOTH THE MATERIALS THAT ARE DELIVERED? TO THE TYPE THE HOW THE JOBS GOING TO BE DONE -- THE CRITERION THE BITS BACK ALL COME INTO PLAY AT THAT POINT AND SO YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THIS ISSUE YOU'D RUN INTO MUCH MORE LITIGATION AND CHANGE ORDER PROBLEMS AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS TYPE OF OF STRUCTURES [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEAR THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES SO FROM THE AUDIENCE. OKAY AS CHAIR CORSET THAT TRAINERS [inaudible] IN BETWEEN. NO OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH NOW TO THE MEMBERS -- ANY DISCUSSIONS AND QUESTIONS [inaudible] OKAY NOTHING [inaudible] THE SERVER. OKAY -- YEAH. ARAMBULA WELL THIS DOCTORS MUST LOOK ALIKE TO YOU DOCTOR. RAISE YOUR HAND I CAN TELL -- YOU KNOW I WANTED TO SHARE A BIT OF THE CONCERNS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO WORK ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MANY OF US IN OUR DISTRICTS AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT AS WELL SO -- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT JUST ENCOURAGE -- COURSE AS WE GO FORWARD THAT -- WERE ABLE TO WORK OUT SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES THAT WERE DISCUSSED TODAY. WHAT THAT I'M LOOK FOR TO MOVE IT WHEN WE HAVE A CORE? SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SO I THINK WE ARE STILL SHORT OF HE ORANGE AND OWNER BANKING THAT LATER OKAY THANK THANK YOU -- AFTER CHOI FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA SAY IS IS THAT I APPRECIATE WHEN WE'RE BUT THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION -- CERTAINLY HERE -- THEIR CONCERNS -- TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A MODEL THAT'S BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY ACTUALLY FOR AGAIN ARE A YEAH ON THE AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES ARE LEASE LEASEBACK PROJECTS ARE DESIGN BUILD PROJECTS. I THINK THAT -- YEAH WE YOU KNOW WHERE -- WE CERTAINLY -- WILL I THINK WORK OUT THE ISSUES WITH THE OPPOSITION REGARDING -- AND STANCE MATT LIABILITY AND CERTAINLY YES THAT'S THE THE THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE THE DSA MAY MAKE SOME CHANGES IN EXACTLY HOW THAT GETS ASSIGNED TO SONY UNDERSTAND THE CONTRACTORS NOT BEING WANTING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR THAT. AND I I WOULD ALSO IMAGINE THOUGH -- IS THAT BEYOND ANY LEGISLATION IT'S REALLY WELL WORK WITH THEM ON IN IN IN DRAFTING THE FINAL VERSION OF THE BILL IS IS THAT -- IF IF SOMEONE HAS A CONTRACT THAT'S GOING TO PUT ALL THE LIABILITY ON THE CONTRACTOR -- I I WOULD HOPE THE CONTRACTOR WOULDN'T ACCEPT THAT THAT CONTRACT AS WELL SO -- IF IT BUT SAME TIME I UNDERSTAND IMPORTANCE OF PUTTING SOME THINGS IN THE ACTUAL BILL THAT THE BECOMES LAW ON CODE THAT ALSO PROVIDE SOME PROTECTION AS WELL CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. ON THIS BUT I THINK THIS AGAIN WILL BE A BENEFIT FOR US SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THANK IMPACT THE PAN. AND THE ORDER THAT THE WATER WHEN WE HAVE A COR THANK YOU WHAT'S NEXT. FIFTEEN HAS BEEN. THIRTY OKAY DOCTOR PAN WHERE YOU HAVE A AND OTHER ONE FIFTIES. YES SB. SIX SIXTY THANK YOU SB SIX SIXTY OKAY WELL THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS. CAMPUS COUNTS THE SERVICES ARE NOT MEETING THE GROWING STUDENT DEMAND AND SB SIX SIXTY REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ESTABLISH A GOAL OF HAVING ONE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR. EVERY FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS ENROLLED AT EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES. THIS RATIO IS RECOMMENDED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION COUNSELING SERVICES TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ON TAP COLLEGE CAMPUSES. SB SIX SIXTY ALSO HOPES TO REMEDY THE GENERAL LACK OF CONSISTENT REPORTING THROUGHOUT EACH SYSTEM BY REQUIRING EACH CAMPUS REPORT THE LEGISLATURE EVERY THREE YEARS. THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR THE SERVICES AND SB SIX SIXTY ADDRESSES THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS FINAL. FACING CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM OF GIVING US THE INFORMATION WE NEED. TO CONTINUE TO GIVE THE CARE OUR STUDENTS DESERVE. A POINT OUT THAT THE RECENT STATES HAVE SHOWN WE HAVE SEEN A LARGE INCREASE AND DEPRESSION OTHER CONDITIONS. BOTH IN ADOLESCENTS AND OFTENTIMES COLLEGE SOON TO TALK ABOUT LATE ADOLESCENCE EARLY TWENTIES BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT TRANSITION TO A HIGHER EDUCATION. ALSO THIS CREATES MANY STRESSORS AND THIS IS ALSO ABOUT BE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION SO STUDENT WHO'S NOT TRANSITIONING WHILE THE STRUGGLING WITH DEPRESSION OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND BY THE WAY MANY OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FIRST MANIFEST THEMSELVES BY THE WAY IN. LATE ADOLESCENCE FOR EARLY TWENTIES IF WHICH IS EXACTLY WHEN STUDENTS ARE COLLEGE WE BE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET THE HELP THEY NEED SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION AND BE ABLE TO THEN -- THE OF THE SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA SO I AM PLEASED TO HAVE WITH ME TODAY DOCTOR IAN WALLACE A MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR FROM CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MARITIME ACADEMY. AND CHART. DRUDGERY SO WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION ASPECT WE ASK WHEN I VOTE. OKAY WITNESSES SAID DR WELLNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF I AM DOCTOR IN LOS COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGISTS FROM CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MARITIME ACADEMY ON BEHLF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING ACADEMICALLY AND PERSONALLY. BECAUSE COUNSELING CENTERS IN THE CSU ARE CHRONICALLY AND WOEFULLY UNDERSTAFFED WHICH IS WHY WE NEED SB. SIX SIXTY CAL MARITIME I'M THE ONLY FULL TIME MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR MY PART TIME CALLING IN AYE SERVER THOUSAND CADETS IN OUR SCHEDULES ARE FULL. EACH DAY A COUNCIL FIVE TO SEVEN STUDENTS ARRIVE EARLY AND STAY LATE YET MY FELLOW CSU COUNTERS AREN'T CENTERS WITH COUNSELOR TO STUDENT RATIOS THREE AND FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN MARITIME. FAR ABOVE THE INDUSTRY STANDARD OF ONE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED SO WHAT'S THE RESULT. CANCERS MEETING WITH STUDENTS IN CRISIS FOR THE MOST DISTRESSED AND THE MOST SUICIDAL. THESE DANGERS RATIOS TURN COUNSELING CENTERS INTO CRISIS CENTERS. STUDENTS NOT IN CRISIS ARE PUT ON WAIT LIST OR FOR OFF CAMPUS TO AN INADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ALL THE WHILE EACH CSU STUDENT CONTINUES TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. IN HEALTH FEES EVERY YEAR FOR ON CAMPUS HEALTH CENTERS THAT TURN THEM AWAY. NATIONALLY DEMAND FOR METALS SERVICES ARE UP 30% 40% THIS PAST YEAR CAL MARITIME WITHOUT EXPANDING CAPACITY SOME CENTER SQUEEZING MORE APPOINTMENTS CHANGING TIMES FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTES. OTHER CENTERS INSTITUTE MODELS WERE SELF HELP MATERIALS GROUP COUNSELING OR COMMUNITY REFERRALS ARE THE FIRST LINE OF TREATMENT. THIS IS THE KIND OF SUB STANDARD AND SHOPPING MENTAL HEALTH CARE THE LIKE KAISER PERMANENTE A. B. FIND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE CSU. THESE INTERVENTIONS ONCE SEEN AS ADJUNCTS TO THE GOLD STANDARD OF ONE ON ONE COUNSELING OR WORK AROUNDS FOR UNDERSTAFFED CENTERS. DISGUISED AS PROGRESS IN INNOVATION. SB SIX SIXTY ALSO ACCOUNTING CENTER DIVERSIFY STAFF PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE THIS MEANS HAVING COUNCILS REFLECTS STUDENTS RACIAL GENDER SEXUAL ECONOMIC AND OTHER IDENTITIES. THE SEVERAL NOW IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF STUDENTS OF COLOR BUT WILL HELP ELIMINATE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. A MAJOR PILLAR OF THE CSU GRADUATION INITIATIVE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE LASTLY I URGE YOU TO RECOGNIZE THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION AND NOT IGNORE THE METAL THESE OUR STUDENTS ASK YOU TO RATIONALLY CONSIDER DANIEL EISENBERG'S WORK FOR THE UNIVERSITY MICHIGAN WHICH SHOWS THE INCREASING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PAYS FOR ITSELF. IN RETENTION INTUITION. AND LASTLY ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL ACROSS CSU WE COUNT ON YOU TO WEAR THE REAL COST OF INACTION IN THIS PROVIDE CSU STUDENTS ADEQUATE MENTAL SERVICES. ASK FOR SUPPORT SB SIX SIXTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITH -- GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SURGERY SO SUS AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CAL STATE SOON ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS NEARLY HALF A MILLION CSU STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. REALLY THANKFUL TO THE SENATOR AND THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. SINCE IN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES THAT THEY DEAL WITH AND ATTEMPTING TO ATTAIN A DEGREE. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM CSU STUDENTS THIS ENTIRE YEAR -- OUR STUDENTS SHOP SUFFER FROM HIGH RATES OF HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL -- AND AND FOOD AND SECURITY RATES THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLE -- PRIOR -- TO TO RESEARCH BEING DONE. THAT THE STRESS IS TO BE CALLED SHOULDN'T HAVE NEVER BEEN GREATER WHICH IS WHY OUR STUDENTS NEED ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ON THEIR CAMPUSES IN FACT. THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES HAS BEEN SUCH A PRIORITY FOR OUR STUDENTS THAT IT HAS BEEN A TOP PRIORITY IN OUR POLICY AGENDA FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS IN A ROW. AND IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS SUCH A PRESSING ISSUE JUST UNDER HALF OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE THE THE RATIO OF ONE COUNT SORT OF FIFTEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS PROPOSED IN SB. SIX SIXTEEN THIS MEANS THAT ON A MAJORITY OF CAMPUSES STUDENTS REPORTING SIGNIFICANT WAIT TIMES SOMETIMES UP TO A MONTH TO SEE A MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR. AND CAP THAT HOW MANY TIMES THAT THEY CAN SEE A COUNSELOR UP TO SOMETIMES AS LOW AS FIVE TIMES A YEAR. THAT'S WHY PASSING AND FINDING SIX SIXTY IS I SB SIX SIXTY SO CRUCIAL WHEN A STUDENT CAN ACKNOWLEDGE OUR NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT NEARLY A MONTH TO SEE SOMEBODY. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE FACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH THE ISSUES CAN PERCENT REAL AND IMMEDIATE SAFETY CONCERNS FOR THE STUDENT AND FOR STUDENTS AROUND THEM. ADDITIONALLY ON ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES STUDENT FEES ARE USED TO PAY FOR THESE RESOURCES THIS MEANS THAT. THE MOST OBVIOUS WAY TO EXPAND RESOURCES ON CAMPUSES WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE THERE'S SB SIX SIXTY IS TO INCREASE THESE CAMPUS BASED FEES WHICH SOMEOF OUR STUDENTS ON ON ON SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE FORCED TO CONSIDER. GIVING KIND OF THE RATIO THAT WE HAVE TODAY. BUT THIS REALLY ONLY COMPOUNDS THE CYCLE OF AFFORDABILITY MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE TUITION FEES HOUSING BOOKS FOOD. THE ONLY FILL A SOLUTION -- FOR WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH THIS EXACERBATE ONE ISSUE AFFORDABILITY TO SOLVE ANOTHER MENTAL HEALTH. FOR US THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION DAHLE. FINALLY FOR OUR STUDENTS THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH IS ABOUT PRIORITIES. IN THIS CASE -- PRIORITY MEANS FINDING AN ADVOCACY. SINCE OUR PRIORITIZE THIS ISSUE THROUGH INCREASING THEIR OWN CAMPUS BASED FEES TO PAY FOR MORE RESOURCES FACULTY HAVE PRIORITIZE THIS ISSUE BY SPONSORING THIS BILL IN ADVOCATING ON THIS ISSUE. WERE URGING -- YOU ALL THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE CSU TO PRIORITIZE THIS ISSUE AS WELL WE URGE AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU.

WONDERFUL THANK YOU. HI HI GOOD AFTERNOON AYE MAGGIE WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE SANDERS ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL FOR TWO PRIMARY REASONS. FIRST TO UNDERMINES THE AUTHORITY OF OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES INCITING POLICY IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES AS IT BELIEVES ARE BEST SERVE CSU STUDENTS. SECONDLY WHILE ONE ON ONE COUNSELING IS OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT EVER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OUR CAMPUSES ARE GOING BEYOND THIS TO INNOVATIVELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. AND PARTICULARLY THOSE ARE UNLIKELY TO SELF SELECT AND IS SEEKING ASSISTANCE WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. REQUIRING THAT WE USE OUR LIMITED RESOURCES TO MEET STATUTORY EMPLOYMENT RATIOS COULD HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF UNDERMINING SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES CURRENTLY IN PLACE ON OUR CAMPUSES. THIS ONE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED RATIOS AN ASPIRATIONAL GOAL THAT WAS ESTABLISHED MANY YEARS AGO AND IS NOT BACKED UP BY RESEARCH OR DATA. MENTAL HEALTH IS AN EXTREMELY HIGH PRIORITY FOR CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND I DO NOT WANT THERE TO BE ANY CONFUSION REGARDING THE NATURE OF OUR POSITION. WE FULLY BELIEVE AND PROVIDING THIS SERVICE TO STUDENTS IS ONE OF SIX PILLARS OF OUR GRADUATION A SHIP TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND REACHING AND HELPING EVERYONE IN NEED AS A TOP PRIORITY FOR OUR SYSTEM. WITH ME TODAY IS DOCTOR JOYCE DIVERT JAMES ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT OF STUDENT HEALTH AND COUNSELLING SERVICES AT SACRAMENTO STATE. TO SPEAK ABOUT THE VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THAT HER STAFF FOR PROVIDING TO STUDENTS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU. ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH CAN DISCERN OF OUR STUDENTS AND HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING THOSE. WE'VE TAKEN A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE PREVENTION. WE'RE FOCUSED ON PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND INCREASED ACCESS TO SERVICES. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WE HAD FOURTEEN TENURE TRACK FACULTY COUNSELORS AND WE SAW ROUGHLY 3% OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION. IN INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING SESSIONS WE OFFERED NO OUT REACH NO SUICIDE AWARENESS TRAINING NO GROUP THERAPY WE HAD AN ON GOING WAIT LIST FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING. TODAY WE HAVE FOURTEEN COUNSELORS IN A FULLY INTEGRATED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CENTER WE SEE 7210% OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION. WE PREVENTED EE SCREEN FOR DEPRESSION DURING OUR HEALTH CENTER VISITS WE OFFER URGENT CARE COUNSELING SAME DAY IN TAKES. SUICIDE AWARENESS TRAINING WELLNESS IN THE CLASSROOM STUDENT CLUBS PEER HEALTH EDUCATORS SATELLITE COUNSELING OFFICES. EVENING HOURS SINGLE SESSION VISITS AN INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP COUNSELING. IT'S A IT'S COMMON TO HEAR WE NEED TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF SIMPLY ADDING MORE COUNSELORS ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE QUALITY CARE OR IMPROVE ACCESS. THERE ARE MANY APPROACHES CAMPUSES CAN TAKE TO MEET SERVICE DEMANDS. AND BUILD CAPACITY. CAMPUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE DEVELOPING CREATIVE INNOVATIVE SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS THAT MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS. THIS FALL WERE PLANNING TO DEVELOP A PEER COUNSELING PROGRAM ON OUR CAMPUS WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR STUDENTS HOW IMPORTANT MENTAL HEALTH PEER SUPPORT IS. A RECENT REPORT FROM NAMI THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS SURVEYED STUDENTS LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND FOUND THAT 42% OF THE STUDENTS STATED. THAT MENTAL HEALTH PEER SUPPORT SERVICES AND STUDENT CLUBS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR SUPPORT IN COLLEGE. ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO INCREASE STUDENT HELP SEEKING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DISTRESS DUNES TO NOT SEEK HELP FROM MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. CAMPUSES ARE USING MANY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS TO HELP SEEKING. IDENTIFYING STUDENTS AT RISK IS NOT LIMITED TO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON A DAILY BASIS OUR STUDENTS COME INTO CONTACT WITH FACULTY STAFF RESIDENT HALL ADVISORS COACHES SUCCESSOR. SCREENING FOR DEPRESSION DURING PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL VISITS AND OFFERING GATEKEEPER TRAINING TRAINING AND MENTAL HEALTH FOR STATE TO FACULTY AND STAFF ARE JUST A FEW OF THE STRATEGIES THAT CAMPUSES ARE EMPLOYING. A YOU SEE CD THE ASSOCIATION FOR UNIVERSITY COUNSELLING CENTER DIRECTORS RECENTLY OFFERED A NEW METRIC THAT MAY BE MORE USEFUL THAN THE OFTEN QUOTED ONE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED STAFFING MODEL. THE NEW METRIC PROPOSES ONE HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY STUDENT CLIENTS PER ONE FULL TIME COUNSELORS THAT ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVING TREATMENT AND COUNSELING. THIS IS BASED ON YEARS OF COP COLLEGE COUNSELING UTILIZATION DATA. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY RESEARCH THAT SUPPORTS THE ONE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED STAFFING MODEL. WE FULLY AGREE WITH THE NEED FOR MORE FUNDING AND MORE ATTENTION TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE NEED TO INVEST IN COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS TO MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION. AND SUICIDE PREVENTION IN ADDITION TO ENSURING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OTHER INVESTMENTS. SHOULD INCLUDE SUICIDE PREVENTION EDUCATION AND AWARENESS PROGRAMS PEER SUPPORT PROGRAMS RISK FACTOR SCREENINGS TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES FACULTY STAFF TRAINING AND CURRICULUM BASED PROGRAMS IN THE CLASSROOM. FOR STUDENTS WITH CHRONIC OR SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTIES AND OTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE ESSENTIAL. CAMPUSES ARE DEVELOPING WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCES. TO CONNECT STUDENTS TO PROVIDERS THAT WILL BE THERE TO SET THEM UP FOR ON GOING SUCCESS AFTER THEY GRADUATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I URGE YOU TO MAKE MEANINGFUL AND EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS IN OUR STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH. I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY OF THE OPPOSITION. MEMBER SMALL GROUPS -- THEN YOU CAN COME TO A MICROPHONE OKAY -- ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN WALK UP. TO THE MICROPHONE OKAY STATE YOUR NAME AN ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION. ALL RIGHT MY NAME IS AMBER AMERO I AM A STUDENT AT FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY WITH STUDENTS FOR LIFE AT FRESNO STATE AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU IN THE OTHER. ANY OTHER MEMBERS SUPPOSE IN OPPOSITION NO IT WAS JUST ME THAT TO HAVE AN OPINION ARE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WHEN I TURN TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS SO OR STATEMENTS. I I MISSED YOUR INTERACTION SOME SORT OF YOU COVERED THIS BUT HE'S RESPONDED THAT CONCERN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IS TO THERE BEING NO RESEARCH TO BACK UP FIFTEEN HUNDRED ONE IS SORT OF AN IDEAL RATIO YEAH. SOME WE ACTUALLY QUITE DISAPPOINTED THAT -- CSE WOULD CLAIM THERE IS NO RESEARCH ARE NO EVIDENCE. TO TO BACK UP THIS RATIO ACTUALLY THIS RATIO COMES IN INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION COUNSELING SERVICES ACTUALLY THIS IS THE UPPER END OF THE RATIO THAT SHE HAD A RANGE FIFTEEN HUNDRED THE UPPER AND BUT I THINK IF YOU HEAR FROM THE STEWED WITNESSES. WHO CAME IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THEY RECOGNIZE THERE'S A PROBLEM? SO CERTAINLY YES WE WANT TO USE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR SINCE I'VE HAD THE THE THE THE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO VISIT SACKS STATE AND THEIR FACILITIES AND SO FORTH -- AND I WOULD BUT I WOULD ALSO NOTES HEARING FROM STUDENTS -- THAT -- THEY DO NOT FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TIMELY ACCESS THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT STUDENTS. OFTEN ARE DON'T WANT TO COME FORWARD MENTAL HEALTH PART OF ITS STAKE MOTHER PART OF IT IS THEY KNOW WHEN THEY COME FORWARD THEY DON'T GET HELP. NOW I APPRECIATE THAT PARTICULARLY ATTACKS STATE THEY HAVE COME UP WITH THE SYSTEM TO TRY TO GET THOSE STUDENTS AND FIRST AND EARLY AS SOON AS THEY SHOW UP. AND THAT CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ALL OF THE CSU CAMPUSES HOWEVER I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- THERE'S CLEARLY A NEED FOR FOR MORE -- SERVICES THAT ARE. AVAILABLE AND I THINK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE RATE OF OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS COMPARED. TO YEAH WE THINK ABOUT ONE IN FIFTEEN HUNDRED I MEAN YOU START THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YEAH YEAH. WITH THE KIND OF NOW THEY COULD YES THEY COULD HAVE SECURE SUPPORT THEY CAN HELP WITH THAT. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE HELP IN THAT WILL STRETCH THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT AND SO FORTH BUT YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF WAITING TIME THAT MEANS THAT A COUNSELOR WE FOR FROM COUNSELOR HERE. BUT THAT REALLY MEANS IF THEY ACTUALLY HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS AND THINK ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE THAT WILL HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- THAT PIERRE AND AND SO EVEN IF THEY CAN REFER SOMEBODY COUNTY AND BY THE WAY -- THAT'S A LITTLE BIT THE CHALLENGE -- BECAUSE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH THE SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY OVERSEAS. ARE MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM OVER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WELL WHAT YOU WHICH COUNTY DO YOU ACTUALLY LIVE AND WHICH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM DO A SEND YOU TO BECAUSE THE ONE YOU'RE AND MAY NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSEYOU'RE NOT RESIDENT OF IT CETERA. SO I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF BABY IF CHALLENGES SO. AT THAT POINT OUT THIS BILL SUCH AS THE GOAL. I MEAN I AND AND I THINK THAT WE HEAR FROM THE STUDENTS THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ACCESS. WE SET A GOAL WE WANT DATA. I THINK THAT'S PRETTY REASONABLE TO ASK OF THE CSU SYSTEM AND I AND AND SO YOU KNOW I WANT TO WORK WITH THEM -- I I DON'T I I HAVE MET I AM NOT SO HAPPY TO HEAR. THAT TESTIMONY SAYS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE AS SOMEONE WHO'S DEFERENCE AND DATA DRIVEN I THINK I HAVE -- THAT -- AND SO WHEN YOU DID WORKFORCE RESEARCH BEFORE PRIOR TO COMING EMILY THE OTHER INSTITUTION UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. I THINK I TRY TO TAKE DATA AND AND AND AND VERY SERIOUSLY SO -- YOU KNOW WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION THAT'S FINE BUT PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY DATA BEHIND THE BILL THANK YOU. THANKS AND HAVE THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES WAITING BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE -- ONE THE SEVEN THOUSAND RATIO NOW SO THAT AFTER WHAT THE LEAST QUADRUPLE THE NUMBER OF OF COUNSELORS AND HAVE FEASIBLE THAT MY ME. WELL I THINK YEAH AGAIN THAT'S THAT THAT IS WHAT OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE SO. IN FACT ACTUALLY WE SEE YOUR IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY AT APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR GAVE THEM SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THEIR FOR MENTAL HEALTH THERE. SEE IF YOU WERE AT ROUND NINE IT'S ALMOST ONE TO TWO THOUSAND AND E DON'T HAVE DATA -- FOR THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. XIN IS A COMMITTEE COLLEGES EVEN FARTHER BEHIND SO WE DO SET THESE GOALS AND THE CURRENT VERSION THE BILL AND I THINK WE NEED TO BETTER DEFINE THE PROBLEM AND AND THEN -- AND COLLECT DATA AND THEN SEE WHAT KIND OF POLICY SOLUTIONS WE WILL MAKE AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THROUGH WHETHER THROUGH LEGISLATION OF THE BUDGET PROCESS HOW WE CAN GET THOSE RESOURCES. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. I WILL BE SUPPORTING BUT THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF CLARIFICATIONS ON A MAKE US. THANK YOU. SINCE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF A CSU. OF OPPOSE AND STATING THAT THAT THEY ARE DOING [inaudible] WHILE. WHAT THE WAS THE -- MOTIVATION WHEN YOU. HAD TO A PROPOSED THIS BE OUR WAS THERE ANY -- OUT CRYING -- STUDENT BODY WE NEED MORE COUNSELORS SO WAS IN THE RECENT OF US -- NUMBER ONE QUESTION AND THEN I KNOW THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE BUT THE HAVE YOU. CONSIDERED THE NUMBERS TO NEEDY TELL WHETHER THIS WOULD BE WHAT -- OUT OF THE OLD BUDGET OR THE SEPARATE BUDGET PROPOSED TO IS THAT YOUR INTENT. SO AGAIN AS I MENTIONED THAT -- AFTER WENT THROUGH PREPARATIONS IN THE SENATE WE ESTABLISHING THIS IS A CALL WE ALSO WANT SOME DATA COLLECTION WE WANT I WANT TO WORK WITH -- THE CSU TRUSTEES AND CHANCELLORS THAT CERTAINLY IS A SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE A FACULTY MEMBER CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE. BUT I THINK ALSO WHERE HE SAID THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE BILL WE'RE HEARING FROM STUDENTS WERE HEARING FROM FACULTY OR TEACHING STUDENTS THEY'RE SEEING STUDENTS STRUGGLE. THEY NOTE THAT THE STRUGGLE IS DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THERE ARE FINE YEAH HEARING FROM THE STUDENTS THAT -- THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE ACCESSING THE SERVICES AT SOME AT MANY CAMPUSES AND WE'RE HEARING FROM STUDENTS AND YOU SAW WE SAW ALL THE STUDENTS TESTIFYING SAID THEY SUPPORT THE BILL SO -- LET'S LISTEN TO THE STUDENTS LET'S LISTEN TO THE FACULTY. LET'S SET A GOAL IS COLLECTED DATA LET'S WORK WITH THEIR UNIVERSITIES AND TRY TO BE SURE WE GET THEM ACCESS TO THE MATH HELP THEY NEED BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT STUDENTS DROPPING OUT WE DON'T STUDENTS NOT ABLE TO GRADUATE NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR COURSES ARE PASSED THE COURSES. BECAUSE THEY HAVE UNMET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS I MEAN THAT'S THE LOS THAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR CAMPUSES AND EVENTUALLY THAT MEANS TO OUR STATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS. DO HAVE BEEN ABOARD PROP UP FIGURE HOW MUCH HEARERS TAKE TO IMPLEMENT YOU YOU ARE NOT OF THE TARGET NUMBER. FIFTEEN HUNDRED WELL CERTAINLY IF HE SAID THAT WE SET THAT AS A GOAL -- SO. IT'S A AND IN TERMS OF THE SO IT CERTAINLY IS A GOAL THERE'S NOT REQUIREMENTS -- AND SO IN THAT SENSE WE DON'T HAVE THE FISCAL ASSOCIATE WITH THE RECORD NOW WITH THAT BEING A REQUIREMENT IT'S MAINLY FOR THE DATA COLLECTION OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WHEN THE MEMBERS. ARE A DOCTOR OR A MEMBER OF I JUST WANTED TO ECHO THE COMMENT I BELIEVE OF DOCTOR WALLACE THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE COUNSELING SERVICES AND NOT CRISIS SERVICES.

TO SB TWENTY FOUR SENATOR LABOR SHARE. GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT MISTER CHAIRMAN BURRS FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL IS MUCH APPRECIATED. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THE US SUPREME COURT RULED THAT DUE PROCESS THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION. PROVIDES A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY THE PROTECT THE WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. AS WE ALL KNOW THAT LANDMARK CASE IS ROE V. WADE. NOW ALMOST A HLF A CENTURY LATER PEOPLE GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN THINK OF TO RESTRICT ASKED ACCESS. AND TO SHAME THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO HAVE AN ABORTION. THOUGH OUR FORMER GOVERNOR MAY HAVE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT UNREASONABLE FOR A COLLEGE STUDENT TO TRAVEL OFF CAMPUS TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION. I RESPECTFULLY AND PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE. MEMBERS JUST THREE YEARS AGO A GROUP OF COMMITTED UC BERKELEY STUDENTS START A GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO BRING MEDICATION ABORTION TO THEIR ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. AFTER SPEAKING. TO THEIR ADMINISTRATION AND RAISING SIGNIFICANT FUNDS TO THAT END THEY WERE STILL REJECTED BY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AT THAT POINT I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE THE EFFORT HERE IN THE CAPITAL. SB TWENTY FOUR IS A CONTINUATION OF THAT EFFORT. THE COLLEGE STUDENT RIGHT TO ACTS AS A COLLEGE STUDENT RIGHT TO ACCESS ACT WOULD REQUIRE ALL ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. TO PROVIDE MEDICATION FOR EARLY PREGNANCY TERMINATION FOR STUDENTS BY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE RESEARCH FROM UC SAN FRANCISCO ESTIMATES THAT EVERY MONTH FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN STUDENTS AT THIRTY FOUR UC AND CSU CAMPUSES. SICK MEDICATION ABORTIONS AT OFF SITE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IF WE TRULY VALUE ACCESS TO ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING STUDENT SUCCESS. THAT IT'S CRITICAL THAT THESE HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS EVERY MONTH ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES ON CAMPUS. MEDICATION ABORTION IS A TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE A PATIENT TAKES TWO SETS OF PILLS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS DURING THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. ACCORDING TO UC SAN FRANCISCO STUDY PLUS YOU. MEDICATION ABORTION IS VERY SAFE WITH MAJOR COMPLICATIONS OCCURRING ONLY ZERO POINT 3% OF CASES MAKING IT SAFER THAN TYLENOL FOR ****. THOUGH MANY CUP HEALTH CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUCH AS PREGNANCY OPTIONS COUNSELING AND CONTRACEPTIVES NONE CURRENTLY OFFERS ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS. MEDICATION ABORTION IS CLINICALLY SIMPLER THAN MUCH OF THE CARE ALREADY OFFERED A COLLEGE STUDENT HEALTH CARE CENTERS. SUCH AS DIABETES MANAGEMENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. ACCESS TO STE IS SEVERELY LIMITED FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS SINCE ONLY 15% OF THE CLOSEST OFF CAMPUS ABORTION PROVIDERS ARE OPEN ON WEEKENDS. MEETING THAT STUDENTS MAY HAVE TO MISS CLASS EXAMS AND WORK. AND TO ACCESSIBLE OR XIN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT HAS DETERMINED ALMOST HALF A CENTURY AGO TO BE A PROTECTED CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IS CRITICAL SINCE STUDENTS MUST RECEIVE THIS CARE WITHIN THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN FIND OUT THAT THEY'RE PREGNANT UNTIL THE FIFTH OR SIXTH WEEK. MEMBERS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ISN'T JUST A SLOGAN BUT RATHER A COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING TRUE ACCESS TO ABORTION FOR CALIFORNIANS ACROSS OUR STATE INCLUDED COLLEGE STUDENTS AT A PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. HERE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS DOCTOR BUSH MY UPDATE ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN RESIDENCE AT THE APARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES. ANY RESEARCH AND RESEARCH AT THE ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RESEARCH PROGRAM YOU'RE BUSY LADY. AND MCKENNA FETZER A STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS DOCTOR OR SMOKE POT YEAH I AND I AM ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND A PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENTIST. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO IN A UNIVERSITY PROGRAM THE ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ANSWER. AT UCSF WE RECENTLY PUBLISHED TWO STUDIES RELATED TO CAMPUS ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST STUDY LED BY MY COLLEAGUE DR DANIEL GROSSMAN COLLECTED INFORMATION FROM ALL OF THE UC AND CSU STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS. THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT IT WOULD BE VERY FEASIBLE TO OFFER MEDICATION ABORTION AT THEIR FACILITIES. I LED THE SECOND STUDY ABOUT MEDICATION ABORTION AMONG STUDENTS AND THE CURRENT BARRIERS THEY FACE. IN THIS STUDY WE FOUND BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO AND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN UC AND CSU STUDENTS SEEK MEDICATION ABORTION OFF CAMPUS EACH MONTH. GIVEN THAT TO VISITS ARE RECOMMENDED FOR A MEDICATION ABORTION MANY STUDENTS HAVE TO TRAVEL OVER TWO HOURS BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT. AND TRAVEL TIME FOR FIVE CAMPUSES ALL OF WHICH ARE CS USE IS MORE THAN ONE HOUR EACH WAY OR FOUR HOURS TOTAL. MANY STUDENTS HAVE LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT GOING OFF CAMPUS FOR CARE. OVER HALF FOR LOW INCOME AND MANY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR. APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY AND SCHEDULING AN APPOINTMENT OFF CAMPUS MAY CAUSE FURTHER DELAYS. STUDENTS MAY BE FORCED TO MISS CLASSES WORK OR OTHER SCHOOL COMMITMENTS WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT. THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. MEDICATION ABORTION IS SAFE AND SIMPLE TO PROVIDE ALMOST FOUR MILLION US WOMEN HAVE HAD A MEDICATION ABORTION AND SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS ARE VERY RARE LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF 1% BASED ON MEDI CAL DATA. CLINICIANS USUALLY GIVE PATIENTS THE MIFEPRISTONE TO TAKE RIGHT AWAY AT THE CLINIC AND THE MESA PROSTITUTE TAKE HOME ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HOURS LATER. SO WHETHER STUDENT GETS ABORTION PILLS FROM A LOCAL CLINIC OR A STUDENT HEALTH CENTER THE ABORTION WILL TAKE PLACE AT HOME OR WHERE SHE CHOOSES. STUDENTS SEEKING ABORTION NEED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT DO NOT INVOLVE UNNECESSARY INTERRUPTION AND SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS IN THERE ARE COMPLEX LIVES. BEING FORCED OFF CAMPUS WHETHER OTHER WHAT WHEN OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE ON CAMPUS. UNNECESSARILY BURDEN TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO NEED AN ABORTION. THANK YOU [inaudible] HELLO. MY NAME IS MCKENNA FETZER AND I'M A SENIOR AT UC BERKELEY THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY. LAST YEAR I DISCOVERED I WAS PREGNANT. I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE I HAD AN IED. I KNEW I WANTED A MEDICATION ABORTION. UNFORTUNATELY I WAS UNABLE TO GET THE METHOD OF CARE I HAD CHOSEN. NOR WAS I ABLE TO GET MY ABORTION IN A TIMELY MANNER. I HAD TO GO TO MULTIPLE PROVIDERS. AN URGENT CARE CENTER TO CONFIRM THE PREGNANCY AT A HOSPITAL TO CONFIRM THE PREGNANCY WAS AN ECTOPIC. GETTING AN ABORTION AT THAT HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. CLINICS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT I CALLED WERE BOOKED FOR WEEKS AND I NEEDED CARE QUICKLY. BECAUSE I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. FOR MY STUDY ABROAD IN A COUNTRY WHERE ABORTION IS LEGAL. I NEEDED MY STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. ULTIMATELY I ENDED UP HAVING A SURGICAL ABORTION WHICH WAS NOT MY PREFERRED METHOD OF CARE. WITH SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR I COULD HAVE AVOIDED THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF BILLS AND FIVE HOURS OF DRIVING BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND CLINICS THAT MADE MY EXPERIENCE STRESSFUL AND EXPENSIVE. HAD SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR BEEN IN PLACE I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CALL THE TANK CENTER FOR SUPPORT. I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET MY ULTRASOUND CONFIRMED THE PREGNANCY WAS NOT ECTOPIC. AND ULTIMATELY GET THE ABORTION PILL ALL IN ONE PLACE. THE HEALTH CENTER WOULD HAVE ALSO KNOWN THAT MY STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN COVERED ALL OF MY SERVICES. INSTEAD I WAS ALONE. CALLING CLINIC AFTER CLINIC NAVIGATING CONFUSING INSURANCE QUESTIONS AND COMPLICATED REFERRALS. I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP. MY EXPERIENCE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. STUDENTS ON BIRTH CONTROL CAN STILL GET PREGNANT. STUDENTS WILL ALWAYS NEED ABORTIONS. AND SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR ENSURE IS NOT ONLY THAT MEDICATION ABORTION IS AVAILABLE ON CAMPUS WHERE WE ALREADY GET OUR HEALTH CARE. BUT THAT WE HAVE A SOURCE OF SUPPORT TO TURN. TO I SHARE MY STORY WITH YOU TODAY TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND VOTE YES ON SENATE BILL. TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YEAH.

HI RUN QUAN -- UC DAVIS ALONA AND STUDENT AT UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA LAW SCHOOL IN STRONG SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU COME FORWARD TO THE TABLE THEY BEGIN. WELCOME THANK YOU MY NAME IS BERNADETTE TASTY AND I JUST GRADUATED WITH MY MA FROM FRESNO STATE AND ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF FRESNO PRO LIFE FUTURE. I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE MY TOP THREE REASONS WHY THIS BILL CONTRADICTS ITSELF. NUMBER ONE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT ACCESS BUT THE BILL STILL PLACES THE MANDATE ON ALL PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES EVEN THOUGH MANY SCHOOLS HAVE AN ABORTION PILL PROVIDER WITHIN JUST A FEW MILES OF THE CAMPUSES. YET THERE HAS BEEN NO DISCUSSION OF AN EXEMPTION FOR SCHOOLS LIKE THESE. NUMBER. TWO ESTIMATES FOR TIME TAKEN TO TRAVEL TO THE ABORTION PILL PROVIDER ARE BASED ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TAKING MUCH MORE TIME THAN SAY AN OVER. OF COURSE AND OVER HAS A SMALL CHARGE BUT IS MUCH FASTER THAN THE THIRTY MINUTE BUS ROUTE ESTIMATE PRESENTED BY PROPONENTS OF THE BILL. LAST YEAR THE AUTHOR STATED THAT THE SUPER COSTS WOULD BE MORE OF A BURDEN HOWEVER FOR ONE THING IF YOU'RE ON MEDICARE AL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR FREE. END OF THE CSU AND YOU SEE SYSTEMS BOTH STATE IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ANALYSES BOTH LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR AT THE FUNDS FOR SB TWENTY FOUR ARE INSUFFICIENT BY THE MILLIONS. AND AT THE COST WOULD LIKELY FALL TO THE STUDENTS SO ALTHOUGH THIS BILL SHOULD BE SAVING US FROM SPENDING MORE MONEY ON AND OVER IT WILL ACTUALLY COST US MORE IN OUR MANDATORY STUDENT FEES. NUMBER THREE DR DANIEL GROSSMAN WHO HAS TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL SEVERAL TIMES CO AUTHORED AN ARTICLE STATING THAT THE FAILURE RATE OF THESE PILLS IS BETWEEN THREE AND OVER 15%. THIS NUMBER VARIES DEPENDING ON HOW FAR ALONG THE WOMAN IS IN HER PREGNANCY SO OF ALL THE STUDENTS TAKE THE PILLS IN THE SIXTH WEEK OF PREGNANCY THERE MIGHT BE A 3% FEEL RIGHT. BUT IF THEY'RE IN THE NINTH WEEK OF PREGNANCY IT MIGHT BE OVER AUTHORS ESTIMATE OF FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS USING THIS SERVICE ACH MONTH. THIS MEANS THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND SEVENTY FIVE GIRLS WOULD NEED A FOLLOW UP SURGICAL ABORTION EACH MONTH. SEVERAL PRO CHOICE INDIVIDUALS HAVE SIGNED A PETITION AGAINST THIS BILL AND OUR OWN FORMER PRO CHOICE GOVERNOR BROWN VETO THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNNECESSARY. THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS REGARDING THIS BILL AND BECAUSE OF THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. OR ABSTAIN FROM VOTING THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS TO MICAH BASSMAN I GRADUATED LAST MONTH FROM UC BERKELEY I'M STRONGLY OPPOSED SB TWENTY FOUR LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU FOUR REASONS WHY TODAY. NUMBER ONE IS THIS BILLS HISTORY THIS BILL ORIGINATED ON MY CAMPUS WIDE STUDENT THERE YET BERKELEY'S OWN OPENLY PRO CHOICE ADMINISTRATION REFUSED TO IMPLEMENT THIS BILL THE FIRST TIME. AFTER TWO YEARS OF DISCUSSING THIS BILL AT THE STATE LEVEL I SIMPLY MUST ASK WHY WE STILL HAVE NOT ADDRESS MY MINISTRATIONS REGIONAL CONCERNS. NUMBER TWO THIS BILLS INCONSISTENT AIM OF HOLDING CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. OUR STATE SHOULD BE UPHOLDING ALL CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTED RIGHTS WE CAN'T JUST PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH ONES. THESE INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM POSSESSED BY ALL PUBLIC UNIVERSITY STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE HER PERSONAL MORAL OBJECTIONS TO THEIR OWN STUDENT FEES DIRECTLY FUNDING ON CAMPUS ABORTIONS. YES BE TWENTY FOUR HAS NO SIMPLE OPT OUT PROVISION FOR THE STUDENTS. AND THIS LOOKS THE OTHER WAY WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. REASON NUMBER THREE STUDENT SAFETY. THE BILL'S AUTHORS HAVE A SORT QUOTE UNQUOTE CLINICALLY SIMPLE TO PROVIDE BUT THEY HAVE YET TO ADDRESS THE DIFFICULTY OF TRYING TO CONTAIN. INDUCEMENTS CARROTS WITH A NON PRIVATE UNSANITARY AND CO ED DORM ON A CAMPUS WITH ALLIES IS UNDERSTAFFED ESTO YOU'LL SERVICES I HAVE LIVED IN SUCH AN ON CAMPUS FOR MYSELF. WHETHER OR NOT LIKE THIS REALITY THIS IS THE REALITY OF THE LIVING CONDITIONS ON CAMPUS. AND FINALLY NUMBER FOR STUDENT FEES. SB TWENTY FOUR CONTAINS AN OVERLY SIMPLISTIC ONE SIZE FITS ALL THIRTY ONE CAMPUSES BLANKET FINANCIAL PROGRAM PROVIDES NO MEANS OF COVERING ONGOING COSTS WHICH THIS COMMITTEES OWN ANALYSIS REPORTS AS UP TO THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE UC SYSTEM ALONE. THIS INADEQUATE FINANCIAL PLAN COMES AT A PRICE LIST PRICE IS GOING TO BE PAID FOR HIGHER STUDENT FEES BUT THE SAME STUDENTS ALREADY FACE FINANCIAL BEARS THE EDUCATION. IS FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU CHOOSE TO VOTE NO OR TO OBTAIN FROM VOTE IN SB TWENTY FOUR TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HE'D COME TO THE MIKE GIVE YOUR NAME THE GROUP YOU REPRESENT.

THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MANDATE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE HEALTHCARE. THE UNIVERSITY OPERATES A HEALTH PLAN FOR STUDENTS CALLED YOU SEE SHIP. REPRODUCTIVE. HEALTH CARE IS CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL BENEFIT FOR STUDENTS. AND THE UNIVERSITY FULLY SUPPORT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS FOR EACH STUDENT WE HAVE NOT WAVERED IN THIS RESOLVE. HOWEVER YOU SEE DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON SB TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE THERE ARE. OUTSTANDING ISSUES WE ARE WORKING THROUGH WITH THE AUTHOR THE ISSUES ARE PRIMARILY AROUND IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS WHILE MOST OF THE PUBLIC CONVERSATION SURROUNDING THIS BILL HAS. CENTERED ON THE WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE THIS HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE FOR THE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR ON REPEATED OCCASIONS THAT WE SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. OUR RIGHT OF CHOICE THE PROBLEMS WITH ACCESS TO THE SERVICE OR NOT PROXIMITY RATHER THE PROBLEMS ARE THAT REFERRALS HAVE NOT BEEN SEAMLESS AND THEY SHOULD BE. FOR THIS REASON WE UNDERSTAND THE OFFERS BILL WOULD LIKE THE SERVICE ON CAMPUS DIRECTLY WHICH WILL HELP RESOLVE SOME OF THE INSURANCE CONNECTION TYPE ISSUES. STUDENTS HAVE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SOLUTIONS WITH THE OFFERS OFFICE AND WE STILL NEED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF FUNDING SOURCES. POST IMPLEMENTATION TWENTY TWENTY THREE BRINGING THE SERVICE ON CAMPUS WITHOUT A FUNDING SOURCE BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY THREE WOULD INCREASE COSTS TO STUDENTS. SINCE HEALTH CARE CENTERS ARE SUPPORTED BY STUDENT FEES. WE KNOW WE HAVE A CHAMPION AND A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH SENATOR LEYVA OFFICE AND ARE HOPEFUL WE CAN RESOLVE. THESE OUT YOUR FUNDING ISSUES THEN NOW THIS IS REYES IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS AND WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

SEE NINE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER PATTERSON [inaudible] AGAIN -- THIS IS FAMILIAR TERRITORY WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

THIS IS -- THERE'S THERE THERE THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED IN THIS -- WHICH WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY OF HEALTH RISK -- WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY LIABILITY RISK. I THINK THAT THE UNIVERSITIES ARE [inaudible] CAREFULLY. ARE COMMUNICATING WITH OF THIS. COMMITTEE ON THE BILL BUT ABSENT. SOLVING THE COST QUESTION. OR THE QUESTION OF STUDENT FEES -- THIS I THINK HAS THE SAME KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT THE PREVIOUS BILL. I HAD BEFORE AND SO I'M I'M GOING TO BE A NO VOTE AGAIN. BUT ALSO -- IT SEEMS TO ME THE THAT THAT THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY. THE EFFORT TO INVOLVE THE UNIVERSITIES IN SOMETHING. FOR WHICH I THINK THE UNIVERSITIES ARE [inaudible] TRYING. AND YET THEY ARE EXPRESSING THE KINDS OF CONCERNS OVER COST LIABILITY. PUSHING THIS OFF ON STUDENT FEES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WHEN. BY BY THE TESTIMONY THE OF THE PREVIOUS. BILL AND TESTIMONY HERE. WE HAVE SERVICES. LIKE THESE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE UNIVERSITIES. OUR AND SO I I FIND THE THE RISK THE COST THE LIABILITY AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE UNIVERSITIES OVER THIS. COMPELLING REASONS TO OPPOSE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR. US SENATOR -- LEYVA. I DON'T WANNA GET INTO UP PRO CHOICE OR PRO LIFE QUESTION ISSUE BUT THE A RELATED -- TO LIABILITY ISSUE COSTS OF I WONDER. WHO'S GONNA BE IN CHARGE F THE MEDICAL WASTE. FROM THE CHEMICAL ABORTION CSU CAMPUSES. SINCE THE ARE LOW CLEARLY STATES THAT THE CSU AND ARE YOU SEE. ARE RESPONSIBLE OR FOR THE HEALTH AND THE WELFARE OF THE STUDENTS SO ON THE CAMPUS. IT WOULD BE HANDLED BY THE HEALTH CARE CENTERS. DO YOU HAVE ANY -- EXPECTATIONS HOW THEY WOULD HANDLE THEM. SINCE I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT I DON'T WORK AND HEALTH CARE FACILITY NO I DO NOT I WOULD LEAVE IT TO THEM BUT I THINK I HAVE A DOCTOR WHO CAN. HELP ME OUT [inaudible] I'M. MEDICATION ABORTION IS DONE ONLY UP TO TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY SO THERE'S PREGNANCY TISSUE THAT WOULD COME OUT THAT IT EXPELLED IF THE PERSON IS FIVE TO SIX WEEKS IT'S IT'S RESEMBLES LIKE. THE MOST -- VERY SEVERE CASE OF MENSTRUATION SO IT IS THE CONTENTS OF THE UTERUS. COME OUT OVER IN USING PADS OVER THE COURSE OF A DAY OR TWO OKAY. EXPANDING THE LIABILITY -- AFTER ISSUING SUCH OF TAMMY CALLED TO STUDENTS SO IF THERE'S ANY COMPLICATIONS. SEVERE AND FOURTEEN COMPLICATIONS OF THOSE CHILDREN BODY -- AND THE HOST COULD NOT BE -- RESPONSIBLE. SO I'VE ONLY I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THAT SO BE NO DIFFERENT THAN WHEN AS SOON BECAUSE TO THE HEALTH CARE CENTER AND GETS A SUICIDE COUNSELING. IF THAT STUDENT THEN ULTIMATELY COMMITTED SUICIDE IS THE DISEASE -- THE U. S. SEATS ISSUE ARE YOU SEE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. SAID THE HEALTH CARE CENTERS ALSO OFFERED DIABETIC COUNSELING IF THE STUDENT WENT INTO A DIABETIC COMA WITH THE HEALTH CARE CENTER THEN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AS WELL. SO IT'S SIMILAR TO THOSE ISSUES. AND AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE STUDENT RECEIVES A MEDICATED MAN MEDICATION FOR THE MEDICAID ABORTION. ON CAMPUS OR OFF CAMPUS THEY WILL STILL BE GOING BACK TO THEIR DORM ROOM [inaudible] I PERSONALLY FEEL -- THAT -- THIS KIND OF ISSUE IS SOME MORE PERSONAL. RATHER THAN INSTITUTION THE CAMPUS IS. OUT WOULD HAVE TO STEP IN. AND THAT ENCOURAGE AND HELP ON HOW TO CONDUCT. THEM. IT IS ACTUALLY -- BEAUJON. AND SO IT IS A SOLEMN NOW MY MORAL ISSUE A WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] DOCTOR WEBER. YES I WANT -- TO I WANT I WANT TO THANK SENATOR LEAHY BEFORE BEING PERSISTENT AND BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR MANY OF FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPLETE. THE BASIC INFLATING THE ISSUE WITH THE NORMAL ABORTION THAT YOU SEE THAT HAPPENS IN A HOSPITAL MEDICAL FACILITY WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT MORE STAFFING. AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXIST -- WITH IS A BLOCK FROM CAMPUS OR A MILE FROM CAMPUS THE SAME PROCEDURES THERE. AND THE SAME RISK IS THE S. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT -- YOU KNOW HAVING SPENT -- MOST OF MY LIFE FOR THE UNIVERSITY WORKING WITH STUDENTS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. OF AND HAVING BEEN INVOLVED WITH A NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE IN A CRISIS SUCH AS THIS -- I KNOW THAT IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME FOR THEM AND THE FRIENDLY PLACE TO BE IS A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE MOST COMFORTABLE AND AND FEEL THEY KNOW THE INDIVIDUALS. HAVE HAD STUDENTS WHO HAVE TO TRAVEL OFF CAMPUS AND IT WASN'T HOURS AND HOURS THAT THEY HAD TO GO AS WE RIGHT IN THE HEART OF SAN DIEGO. BUT THEY WERE GOING TO A A PLACE THEY DID THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH. OFTENTIMES THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO COME TO THIS CAMPUS WHO KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE CITY OTHER THAN THE IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND WHETHER PART IT IS BUT THEY HAVE NO. REAL CONNECTIONS TO THE MEDICAL A COMMUNITY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THEIR ONLY SOURCE REALLY OF MEDICAL CARE IS THE STUDENT CENTER. AND THEY HANDLE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT THEY GO IS JUST FOR COLDER THE FLU THEY HANDLE AN AWFUL LOT OF STUDENT ISSUES AND ILLNESSES THAT OCCUR -- ESPECIALLY FOR THE FIRST YEAR STUDENTS WHO WHO MAY HAVE SOME FORM OF HEPATITIS A MAY HAVE ALL OF THE KINDS OF BILLS ILLNESSES STDS YOU NAME IT. AND THE CAMPUSES HAVE TO HANDLE ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND THEY ARE AS PROFESSIONAL ENOUGH TO KNOW WHICH ONES CAN BE HANDLED THERE AND WHICH ONE SHOULD BE HANDLE SOMEWHERE ELSE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS BILL COMES WITH THE SONOGRAM OF FORUMS TO MAKE IT SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND AND SOLD ACT I STRONGLY. RECOMMEND THAT WE WE MOVED WITH THIS BILL MAINLY BECAUSE IT REALLY IS AN ISSUE OF ACCESS NO SHE MORE THAN THE ISSUE OF PRO LIFE OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THOSE ARE. ISSUES THAT ARE BEING RESOLVED OR EITHER NEVER GOING TO BE RESOLVED. TO EVERYONE'S SATISFACTION BUT AS LONG AS THEY ARE THIS IS LEGAL AND IT IS AS SIMPLE AS IT IS IT MAY SOUNDS DIFFICULT FOR US IN THIS GENERATION. BUT IT'S A SIMPLE AS IT IS -- WE HAVE TO BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT IT THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO IT. AND I'VE SEEN STUDENTS WHERE. THEY HAD TO MAKE DIFFICULT CHOICES THEY'RE MAKING A DIFFICULT CHOICE ANY TIME THAT THEY'RE PREGNANT AND THEIR STUDENT AT MERRITT ON CAMPUS THEY MAKE DIFFICULT CHOICES ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I DON'T IMMEDIATELY BUT TO THEM IN THE FUTURE. AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY ENTER INTO LIGHTLY AS MOST FOLKS THINK THEY DO AND I'VE HAD STUDENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON DECIDED NOT TO CONTINUE WITH THE PREGNANCY. I'VE HAD STUDENTS ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO CONTINUE TO TERMINATE WHO WHO TERMINATE A PREGNANCY AND EACH ONE IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT AND A PERSONAL DECISION. AND EACH ONE'S LIFE IT WAS OF AN IMPACTED BY IT OF SO THAT STUDENTS WHO FELT THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THEY HAD AVAILABLE TO THEM. FOR ECONOMIC REASONS AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS HAD TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAY AND MOVED ON WITH THEIR LIFE AND SOME OF THEM STILL WRITE ME TODAY. WHO'S NOW MARRIED AND HAD KIDS AND ALL THOSE THINGS AND OTHERS WHO HAVE THE CHILDREN STILL WRITE ME TO WOULD DAY WITH A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID THAT THEY HAD WHEN THEY WERE IN COLLEGE BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION. AND I THINK WE SHOULD NOT MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED OR PUT IN OBSTACLES IN PEOPLE'S WAY WHEN THEY'RE HAVING SOME LIFE DECISIONS THAT HAVE TO BE MADE. BASED ON THEIR VALUES BASED ON THEIR FAMILY BASED ON THEIR NEEDS AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME LIKE I SAID HAVING GONE THROUGH THIS WITH A NUMBER OF MY STUDENTS. I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK IN MY JOB WAS NEVER TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY THOUGHT IT THROUGH KNEW WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO AND IF THEY NEEDED MORE SUPPORT TO PROVIDE THAT MORAL SUPPORT FOR THEM -- IT IS -- AND SO I RECOMMEND THAT WEEK THAT THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY. MOVED IT I SEE MY GOOD FRIEND ARAMBULA WHO IS THE A POSITION WHO KNOWS HOW UNCOMPLICATED THIS CAN BE BUT WE DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATED MORE IN TERMS OF THE LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL. DIFFICULT DECISION THE FACT THAT -- STUDENTS TRIED GET IT DONE THE NORMAL PROCESS WHAT WE SAY WELL ORGANIZED GET YOUR CAMPUS TOGETHER. PUT TOGETHER GOOD PROPOSAL HELP RAISE MONEY BLAH BLAH THEY TRIED ALL THAT AND RAN INTO A WALL AND SOMETIMES THOSE WALLS ARE MORE POLITICAL THAN THEY ARE ANYTHING ELSE MEDICAL. AND AND SO THEN IT BECOMES OUR RESPONSIBILITY ASK QUESTIONS WILL STUDENTS REALLY NEED ON THE CAMPUS STUDENTS AT THE CAP WONDERFUL HEALTH FACILITIES -- SOME FOLKS EVEN OPPOSED TO THAT THAT WE HAVE HEALTH FACILITIES ON CAMPUS IS -- BUT WE DISCOVERED THAT THE CAMPUS IN FALL APART BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE A NICE CLINIC ON CAMPUS THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE STUDENTS COME FROM EVERYWHERE AND THEY NEED HELP THEY NEED SUPPORT. AND THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS COMPLICATION WHEN THEY HAVE A CRISIS IN THEIR LIFE AND THEY NEED THE KIND OF PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT THEY CAN GET TO MOVE FORWARD. SOMEONE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN THOSE WHO HELPED OF THE LAST YEAR TO HAVE. TO DEAL WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE -- THAT'S NECESSARY TO OPEN THESE CLINICS OPEN IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER AND I ASK ALL OF YOU HOPEFULLY TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AS IT GOES FORWARD. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DOCTOR LEYVA OF JEWS ME SENATOR LABEL IF YOU LIKE THE OTHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL BE IMMEDIATELY GOING BACK TO SCHOOL SO THAT I CAN ABOUT THAT -- I I REALLY WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS COME OUT TODAY BOTH IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME AND VOICE THEIR OPINION. I WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE SAID -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON IN THE GOVERNOR'S. VETO MESSAGE HE DID NOT EXPRESS CLEAR CONCERNS HE ACTUALLY JUST SAID THAT HE DID NOT FIND IT ON REASONABLE FOR SOMEONE TO TRAVEL OFF CAMPUS. I DISAGREED WITH HIM PUBLICLY OVER THAT AND I STILL DISAGREE WITH HIM OVER THAT. AND I THINK THAT AS A DOCTOR WEBER SAID. WE'RE NOT TELLING ANYONE WHAT TO DO HERE WE'RE NOT TELLING ANY STUDENT TO HAVE AN ABORTION THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT CHOICE AND IT'S ABOUT ACCESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. THAT BY RECENT EFFORTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT ACCESS ON ABORTION AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS L. G. B. T. RIGHTS IN GENERAL ARE UNDER ATTACK. WELL OTHER STATES ARE TAKING A GIANT LEAP BACK TO THE DAYS OF FORCED PREGNANCY AND MISOGYNY SB TWENTY FOUR WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD. BY REAFFIRMING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS TO ACCESS ABORTION CARE ON CAMPUS. ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING COLLEGE STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE AND CHOICES OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SO THEY PLAN THEIR LIVES THEIR FUTURES. AND THEY CAN DECIDE WHEN TO INCORPORATE A FAMILY INTO THEIR LIFE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK -- WITNESSES ON BOTH SIDES FOR COMING FORWARD TODAY THANK YOU FOR EXPRESSING YOUR VIEWS AND DOING IT SO IN AN ORDERLY -- AND AND CIVIL -- WAY I APPRECIATE THAT I I ALSO WANT. TO EXPRESS MY OWN OPINION -- THAT I I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS IS NOT ABOUT -- PRO CHOICE. OR PRO LIFE THAT THAT WAS DECIDED WHEN I WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. AND BUT IT IS ABOUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS AND AS WE'VE HEARD FROM -- STUDENTS A BILL OVER THE PAST YEAR FOR THE NEED FOR MORE MENTAL -- A SERVICES A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I THINK THAT I HAVE BEEN EDUCATED IN THE PAST YEAR SENATOR WITH YOUR BILL I'VE LEARNED A LOT MORE THAN I KNEW PREVIOUSLY. FROM A YEAR AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CSU AND YOU SEE CAN PROVIDE WITH THAT SAID I WOULD ALSO ASK THE AUTHORED TO LOOK. AT PAGES SEVEN AND EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS AND TO LOOK AT THE QUESTIONS OF BILLING AND TO SEE HOW WE RESOLVE THOSE THOSE ISSUES. SO WE'VE HAD A MOTION BY DOCTOR RUMBULA SECOND BY MR GABRIEL OF MADAM CHAIR IF YOU'D PLEASE -- CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE CHOI.

APRIL TWENTY FOURTH SHALL BE A GLENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE HOLIDAY -- IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE -- WHEN GLENDALE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT DECIDED TO CLOSE OUT OF RESPECT FOR APRIL TWENTY FOURTH UNDER EDUCATION BECAUSE A LOT TO DO THAT NOT LOSE ANY ADA UNFORTUNATE COMMITTEE COLLEGES DON'T HAVE THE SAME FLEXIBILITY SO WHEN GLENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WANTED TO COMMEMORATE APRIL TWENTY FOURTH WHICH IS THE DAY -- THE FIRST GENOCIDE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY -- IS COMMEMORATED THEY ACTUALLY LOSE. MONEY WHEN THEY DO THAT IN THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM -- IN A DISTRICT FRANK ARRIVE THE LARGEST ARMENIAN AMERICAN POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY AND A STUDENT BODY THAT IS A SIGNIFICANTLY. ARMENIAN AMERICAN IT WOULD ALLOW GLENDALE COMMITTEE COLLEGE TO PROPERLY. AND APPROPRIATE COMMEMORATE THE GENOCIDE AND NOT LOSE ANY REVENUE AND WITH ME I HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE DR DAVID BYE BYE ARE HERE. TO SAY A FEW WORDS WELCOME WELCOME TO YOU TO AND CHAIR MEDINA THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER ED COMMITTEE. I A SENATOR PORTANTINO HAS INDICATED GLENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SERVES A CITY AND THE REGION WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF ARMENIAN POP POPULATION OUTSIDE OF ARMENIA PROPER. AND WITHIN THE ARMENIAN DIASPORA ACROSS THE WORLD WE'RE PROUD THAT CLOSE 240% OF OUR CREDIT STUDENTS AND 50% OF OUR NON CREDIT STUDENTS ARE OF ARMENIAN ETHNICITY. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS OUR COLLEGE IS ANNUALLY HELD A NUMBER OF COMMEMORATIONS EDUCATION AND AWARENESS EVENTS DURING APRIL LEADING TO THE APRIL TWENTY FOURTH ARMENIAN GENOCIDE REMEMBRANCE DAY. HOWEVER ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH DUE TO THE STATE LAW REGULATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF TITLE FIVE REGULATIONS WE HAVE NOT BEEN A AS A COLLEGE TO DECLARE. A PUBLIC HOLIDAY SO THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FACULTY OR STAFF COULD JOIN IN GLENDALE AND LA REGION COMMEMORATIVE EVENTS MARCHES AND CONTEMPLATE OF TIME KEEPING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IN PEOPLE'S MINDS SO THAT NEVER AGAIN. WILL WE ACCEPT GENOCIDE OF ANY RACE OR ETHNICITY AND NEVER FORGET THE ATROCITIES TO HUMANKIND THAT OCCURRED. CENTER PORTANTINO'S SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY EIGHT AS AMENDED IS CONSISTENT WITH KEY PRINCIPLES THAT REFLECT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM ONE THE MISSION TO MEET AND REFLECT THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE ROLE OF LOCAL ELECTED BOARDS TO KEEP THIS LOCAL FOCUS AT THE CENTER OF THE WORK OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSULTATION WITH OUR LOCAL EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS. FURTHER SENATE BILL FIVE SIX SIXTY EIGHT AS AMENDED DOES NOT COST THE STATE AND LOCAL TAXPAYERS ANY MONEY. AND IT DOES NOT LESSEN OUR OBLIGATION AS A COLLEGE TO MAINTAIN THE NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS REQUIRED BY LAW STATE REGULATIONS AND ACCREDITATION STANDARDS. THE GLENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD OF TRUSTEES EXPRESSES GREAT APPRECIATION TO SENATOR PORTANTINO FOR TAKING THE LEAD IN MOVING FORWARD THIS LEGISLATION.

TO SO WE WILL GO TO FILE ITEM FOURTEEN SB [inaudible] SEVEN ONE SIX SENATOR MITCHELL. THE WELCOME CENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT A LONG AFTERNOON IT'S BEEN IT HAS. THE BILL I'M THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT [inaudible] J.. TWO TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL SEVEN SIXTEEN WHICH WILL TAKE A CORRECTIVE STEP TOWARDS ENSURING THAT INCARCERATED YOUTH WHO HOLD A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA HAVE ACCESS TO A COLLEGE EDUCATION. AND CAREER VOTE TRAINING CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE JUVENILE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE POST SECONDARY PROGRAMS FOR THESE YOU. STATUTES ONLY REQUIRES COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE FACILITY TO PROVIDE A FULL HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM TO YOU CAN KATHY WHO'VE NOT YET COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR FEW WEEKS TO PROVIDE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAM THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN STEADY STATE REGULATIONS DO REQUIRE COUNTY PROBATION TO ENSURE THAT ALL YOUTH IN THEIR FACILITIES. ARE TREATED EQUALLY WITH REGARD TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY THE YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS STATES THAT YOU IN D. J. F. FACILITIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE. A QUALITY EDUCATION. THE YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS DOES NOT PLACE AGER GRADE LEVEL LIMITATIONS ON THESE RIGHTS. WHERE WHERE CONCERNS FROM THE PROBATION OFFICERS REGARDING THE TIMING OF SEMESTER SCHEDULES A WE THE MINUTE THE BILL TO SPECIALLY ADDRESS COURSE ELIGIBILITY AND COURSE SCHEDULING CONCERNS -- WE UNDERSTAND IS CONCERNED ABOUT UNFUNDED INFRASTRUCTURE AND STAFFING COSTS RELATING TO ONLINE COURSES. AGAIN A BILL BY ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLYMAN GIBSON AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT ALREADY MANDATES THAT COUNTY FACILITIES PROVIDE ACCESS TO INTERNET AND COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. FOR PURPOSES OF EDUCATION THESE YOU COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR TUITION WAIVERS THEREFORE THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TUITION. WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE VERY LENGTH OF STAY IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES WE ALSO AMENDED THE BILL TO NARROW THE MANDATE TO ONLY ONLINE COURSES SO THAT OUR YOUTH IS ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION ONLINE ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED FROM THE FACILITY. ANOTHER CONCERN STATES THAT THE BILL SHOULD INSTEAD REQUIRE A POSTSECONDARY AND VOCATIONAL PLAN. WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL SHOULD BE BOTH THIRD WITH THE INCLUSION OF AN EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL PLAN BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN IN LIEU OF ACTUALLY PROVIDING PROGRAMMING. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK WITH PROBATION OFFICERS ON BOTH THREE IN THE BILL WITH THE INCLUSION OF THIS PROVISION. A QUALITY EDUCATION HAS THE POWER TO READ THE LETTER DIRECT LIVES OF ANY YOUNG PERSON ESPECIALLY THOSE LAWS THE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. EDUCATIONAL EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING DEVELOPED OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS AND LEADS TO PRODUCTIVE CAREER PATH WHICH IN TURN WE NOW THE OBVIOUS REDUCES RECIDIVISM. AND FUTURE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I HAVE TO ADVOCATES WITH ME HERE TODAY LUCY CARTER WITH THE YOUTH LAWCENTER AND JACQUELINE RODRIGUEZ A STUDENT GO AHEAD. AT THE COLLEGE OF SAN MATTEO I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. HELLO MY NAME IS JACQUELINE RODRIGUEZ I FIRST WANT TO THE JUVENILE HALL WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD IN SEVENTH GRADE. I GOT OUT FOR A MONTH AND THEN WENT BACK IN AND LITERALLY DID THREE YEARS I DO NOT CAMP GROUP HOMES THE JUVENILE HALL OR ON THE RUN. WHILE I WAS IN THE CAMP EDUCATION WAS SO HARD FOR ME IT WAS ONE CURRICULUM FOR EVERYONE AND I WAS LEARNING WHAT THE OTHER GIRLS WERE LEARNING EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE MUCH OLDER. THAN A LOT OF THE GIRLS GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHILE THEY WERE STILL IN CUSTODY. AND AFTER THE GRADUATION THEY STILL CAME TO COURT SCHOOL WITH THOSE BUT THEY SAT IN THE BACK OF THE CLASSROOM AND DID NOTHING BUT COLORING AND WRITING IN JOURNALS OR WRITING LETTERS. ARE THEY WENT OUTSIDE IN THE GARDEN THEY HAD NOTHING TO STUDY NOTEBOOKS ARE EDUCATION PROGRAMS WERE OFFERED TO THEM. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FAIR BECAUSE I BECAME CLOSE THOSE GIRLS AND I NEED A POTENTIAL THEY TELL ME THE GOAL THEN THE DREAMS THEY HAD ONE WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR ANOTHER A PROBATION OFFICER. BUT I WILL SAY TO THEM THERE'S NO HOPE FOR US WHO IS GOING TO HELP US. IT DIDN'T GIVE ME MOTIVATION BECAUSE THESE INTELLIGENT GIRLS HAD JUST FINISHED HER HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO WITH IT. WE TALKED ABOUT THEM GOING TO COLLEGE BUT THEY GOT NOTHING TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WHILE THEY WERE STILL INSIDE. NO RESOURCES NO REAL OPPORTUNITY AND NOW I KNOW THAT ONLY TWO OF THOSE GIRLS WENT ON TO COLLEGE AND THOSE TO STUDY COSMETOLOGY. NOW I'M IN MY THIRD YEAR OF STUDY AT COLLEGE OF SOME TAIL I AM HOPING TO RECEIVE ASSOCIATES DEGREES AND POOR SUBJECTS. WHAT I EXPERIENCE INSIDE DID PUSH ME TO ONE A COLLEGE EDUCATION BECAUSE I WANTED TO BREAK THE CYCLE BREAK THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE EDUCATE MYSELF AND BE A ROLE MODEL FOR MY KIDS? NOW BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT I FEEL READY FOR ANYTHING I'M SO EXCITED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND TO LEARN AND TO LEARN FROM OTHERS AND JOB OTHERS LEARN FROM ME. I STRONGLY SUPPORT SB SEVEN ONE SIX BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ALL YOUTH WERE INCARCERATED HOW FULL POTENTIAL LIKE ANYONE ELSE. AND THEY JOB EVERY OPPORTUNITY EVEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES THAN EVERYONE ELSE BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO AND THE POSITION THEY ARE AND AS THE SEVEN ONE SIX PROVIDES THE NECESSARY OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO GO TO COLLEGE. BREAK THE CYCLE AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR SOCIETY I ASK YOU TO VOTE FOR SB SEVEN ONE SIX THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS LUCY SOL SIEGEL CARTER AND I'M THE POLICY ADVOCATE THE USE LAWCENTER. SO YOU HEARD MS RODRIGUEZ'S TESTIMONY -- I WISH THAT HER EXPERIENCE WAS UNIQUE BUT IT IS NOT. THERE'S A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH WHO ARE IN CUSTODY HAVE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS AND HAVE NO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR THEM -- A BILL WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT ALLOWS YOUNG PEOPLE -- IN CUSTODY TO GRADUATE WITH MINIMUM STATE REQUIREMENTS. AND THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN CUSTODY WHO HAVE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS. IS ANYWHERE FROM BETWEEN TEN AND AS HIGH AS 50% IN THE STATE FACILITIES. AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE HAVE SOME POST SECONDARY ED PROGRAMS ALREADY IN FACILITIES -- AROUND THE STATE WE HAVE SOME MODEL PROGRAMS AND THEY ARE DOING WHAT THE SENATOR MENTIONED WHICH IS. THEY ARE ALLOWING YOUNG PEOPLE TO TAKE ONLINE CLASSES IN CUSTODY AND THEN WHEN THEY LEAVE THE FACILITY CONTINUED TAKING THOSE ONLINE COURSES WHEN THEY COME OUT. SO NO CHALLENGES WITH REGARD TO SCHEDULING IT DOES TAKE SOME FLEXIBILITY -- BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO IT. AND WE TALKED ABOUT COSTS ALREADY SO I WON'T I WON'T GO INTO THAT -- AND BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO RE ENVISION THEMSELVES. SO WE WE REALLY SHOULDN'T PENALIZE THEM FOR BEING MOTIVATED TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL WHILE IN CUSTODY GIVEN ESPECIALLY GIVEN ALL THE CHALLENGES ARE FACING. SO RATHER THAN PENALIZE THEM LET SUPPORT THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION WITHOUT DELAY AND WITH THE TIME THEY HAVE WHILE THEY ARE STILL IN CUSTODY. SO FOR THESE REASONS FOR YOUTH LAWCENTER ASKS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.
