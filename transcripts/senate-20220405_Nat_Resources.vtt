SOME. I THINK HE HE THERE'S A

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:46.058
GLOBAL ISSUE HERE WHICH IS IF WE

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.861
WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH.WHICH

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:51.463
ARE SHORT TERM POLLUTANTS AND

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.834
METHANE. LEAKAGE FROM EXISTING

00:18:55.901 --> 00:19:00.472

TERMS OF OUR CLIMATE EFFORTS

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.545
THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND I

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:08.514
WANT TO SALUTE THE OFFER. FOR

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.382
THE FACT THAT SHE'S WILLING TO

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:13.352
TAKE THIS ON I THINK THAT THE

00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:15.254
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE IN THE

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.689
DEBATE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:19.591
AROUND ONE ISSUE. AND THAT WAS

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:23.161
THE ISSUE OF FUNDING BECAUSE

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:24.730
THERE WAS AN ASSUMPTION MADE.

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:27.032
THAT THIS JUST APPLIED TO ALL

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:29.067
EXISTING FUNDING BUT AT THE SAME

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:30.936
TIME. THERE'S FEDERAL MONEY

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:34.106
THAT'S BEEN ALLOCATED. AND THE

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:36.108
IF THERE IS A TIMING ISSUE ABOUT

00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:38.076
WHEN THE MONEY WILL BE AVAILABLE

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:40.178
I WAS GONNA ASK THE AUTHOR. TO

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:42.180
WALK US THROUGH THAT WHAT WHAT

00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:45.117
BECAUSE IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE TO

00:19:45.183 --> 00:19:46.552
RAISE THE CAP BEFORE GETTING

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.820
OUTSIDE MONEY. ARE SO WALK US

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:50.756
THROUGH THE FUNDING ISSUES SO WE

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:52.891
UNDERSTAND THAT THANK YOU AND

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.027
YES SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.995
HAS ALREADY ALLOCATED SOME

00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:58.931
FUNDING FOR THIS AND THAT

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.265
FEDERAL MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOCATED

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.000
THROUGH THE BUDGET WHAT WILL BE

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:03.702
A TIMING ISSUE THAT WILL NEED TO

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:05.604
GET WORKED OUT IN IN IN IN A

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:06.939
POLICY CONVERSATION SHOULD THIS

00:20:07.005 --> 00:20:08.140
BILL MOVE FORWARD. IS THE PIECE

00:20:08.206 --> 00:20:09.875
FOR CAL JAM DOES AN ANNUAL

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:11.310
ASSESSMENT AND THE BUDGET

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:13.011
ALLOCATION IS ACTUALLY NOT

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:14.446
ALIGNED WHEN CAL JIM DOES THEIR

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:16.481
ASSESSMENT IS A DIFFERENT TIMING

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:18.884
THAN WHEN THE BUDGET- SO I WANT

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:19.418
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS

00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:21.253
SOMETHING THAT WE WILL HAVE TO

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.421
WORK OUT AS THIS BILL

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:23.989
POTENTIALLY. AT MOVES FORWARD-

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.024
THAT THE REASON THAT YOU KNOW

00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:27.492
IT'S BEEN SAID THAT TO GET YOU

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.161
KNOW CAL CHEN HAS NOT DONE MORE

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:30.429
THAN FIVE MILLION WHAT WE DIDN'T

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:31.363
AUTHORIZE THAT WE'VE NEVER

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.165
AUTHORIZED THEM TO DO MORE AND

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.933
PART OF THIS CONVERSATION IS

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.302
ABOUT AUTHORIZING TO DO MORE.

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:39.004
ADDITIONALLY YOU KNOW THROUGH

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.473
PASSED TALK ABOUT COLLECTING YOU

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.609
KNOW A ROLLING FUN- BECAUSE

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.344
CALTRAIN HAS TO BE SO SPECIFIC

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.912
IN HOW THEY FIX THESE- WELLS

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:48.347
WHEN THEY'RE ONLY CAPTIVE THEY

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:49.648
WERE CAPPED AT ONE MILLION THERE

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:51.750
NOW CAPPED AT FIVE MILLION. AT

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:53.018
WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY GO OVER

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.187
BUDGET SO THEY'VE HAD TO FIGURE

00:20:55.253 --> 00:20:58.223
OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THESE WELLS-

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.926
AND STAY UNDER BUDGET TO BE ABLE

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:02.094
TO DO THIS SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.362
IS THAT THAT REMAINDER BECAUSE

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:04.963
IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE A PERFECT

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.999
NUMBER I MEAN IF YOU'VE EVER

00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:07.833
DONE BUDGETING FOR AGENCIES JUST

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:08.934
NEVER PERFECT. EVEN FIVE

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:11.370
MILLION- THAT THAT MONEY THEN

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.005
GETS PUT INTO AN ACCOUNT WHERE

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:16.008
WE CAN COLLECT UP TO TWO HUNDRED

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:17.576
MILLION TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS-

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:19.277
WHERE IS ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW

00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:21.213
THIS THIS COST COMING FROM AN

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:25.584
END AT WHITE SUCH HIGH NUMBERS.

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:26.485
WELL BECAUSE WE'VE RECEIVE

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:27.986
WEAVER C. AND- OF THE LAST FEW

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.421
YEARS THAT THIS CAN COST THE

00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:30.422
STATE AND- FROM FIVE HUNDRED

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:32.024
MILLION TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.291
TOTALLY GET THAT THERE'S THAT'S

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:35.027
A BIG BIG RANGE AND THERE'S A

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:37.095
LOT OF DEBATE THERE. BUT ONE OF

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:38.930
THE THINGS I'VE BEEN DOING OVER

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:40.232
THE LAST FEW YEARS IS TRYING TO

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:42.200
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THAT TO A

00:21:42.267 --> 00:21:43.468
HIGHER NUMBER WHEN YOU'RE

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:44.302
LOOKING AT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:46.004
TO FIVE BILLION. HOW ARE WE

00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:48.073
GOING TO GET THAT TO A HIGHER

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.508
NUMBER AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:50.942
SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:51.610
TAXPAYERS AND- STRAIGHT. UP TO

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:53.879
BE ABLE TO DO THAT- AND IT'S

00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:55.313
BEEN VERY DIFFICULT WE'VE DONE

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.415
AT ONE MILLION OR FIVE MILLION

00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:58.016
AT THE TIME. BUT AT THE RATE

00:21:58.083 --> 00:21:59.284
WE'RE GOING I MEAN IT'S GOING TO

00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:01.319
TAKE US IF WE'RE DOING FIVE

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:02.921
MILLION AT A TIME. A HUNDRED

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:04.189
YEARS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:06.224
HERE- AND I THINK THAT. THE

00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:07.392
REASON. THAT YOU KNOW I WENT

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.127
FROM A BILL LAST YEAR TO ALSO. A

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:10.128
BILL THIS YEAR IS BECAUSE OF.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:11.329
ALLOCATION THEY ARE PUTTING

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:13.465
MONEY INTO THIS. AND AT LEVELS

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:14.666
WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE WE WERE

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:16.001
NOT ABLE TO HAVE LEGISLATIVE

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:17.969
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WE'RE GONNA

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:20.405
GET TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:21.907
BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:23.475
GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:24.609
THIS. BRING A POSITION TO NOW

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.644
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:26.311
LEVERAGE FEDERAL LEVERAGE WHAT

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:27.512
WE HAVE. I'M NOT GOING TO

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:29.114
COMMENT ON STATE AGENCIES AND

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:30.515
THEIR EFFICIENCY AND WHAT

00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:31.950
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID OR DID

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.385
NOT DO. I THINK THAT'S BEST

00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:35.353
ADDRESSED WITH THE AGENCIES AND

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.755
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:38.323
ADDRESSED THROUGH THIS

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.558
PARTICULAR POLICY BILL. THERE

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:41.159
ARE A AND THEN LET ME ASK A

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:42.694
FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THAT.

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:44.596
BECAUSE ONE OF THE WITNESSES

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:47.299
SAID JEEZ CAL JAMISON. STAFFED

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.835
UP TO DO THIS BECAUSE- A AND

00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:51.303
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FIVE

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:53.071
MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT IF WE

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:55.774
ACTUALLY GET A FEDERAL. PATIENT

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:56.775
AND LIST THE LIMIT TO

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:59.010
ACCOMMODATE FEDERAL ALLOCATION

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:00.579
THEN WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE CAL

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:02.981
JIM THAT THEY SHOULD STAFF UP.

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:05.684
ACCORDINGLY AS OPPOSED TO. USING

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:07.152
THE FACT THAT THEY'VE STEPPED UP

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.020
FOR A CERTAIN LEVEL AT FIVE

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:10.155
MILLION DOLLARS FOR NOT

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:14.392
ACCEPTING THE FEDERAL ALLOCATION

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.995
AND STAFFING. WE GET IT IS. THAT

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.330
THE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE AND I

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:19.965
THAT THAT'S PART OF A OF THIS

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:21.266
CON. AS WELL I ALSO WANT TO

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.201
POINT OUT THAT THIS APPROACH- IS

00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:24.336
AN APPROACH THAT AT THE

00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:25.937
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:27.939
CAME OUT WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:28.807
TWO TWENTY THREE- OIL WELL

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:30.742
ABANDONMENT AND REMEDIATION-

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:32.744
ANALYSIS THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:36.314
JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO WE-ARE A LINE WHERE WHERE THE L. A.

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:38.150
L. IS TELLING US. THAT WE SHOULD

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:40.085
BE DOING IN TERMS OF THE SHARED

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:40.719
RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN INDUSTRY

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:43.288
AND TAXPAYERS- SO THIS IS AGAIN

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:44.856
AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN WE HAVE THE

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.858
CCSD REPORT WE HAVE ELLIE- I

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:48.126
MEAN WE HAVE MANY WHO HAVE SAID

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:51.229
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A DIRECTION-

00:23:51.296 --> 00:23:53.398
THAT WE SHOULD BE GOING IN. AND

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:56.034
THEN MISTER CHAIR COMMENT OF I

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:58.937
THINK THAT THIS EXCHANGE ED THE

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.705
PRESENTATION AND EVEN DIFFERENT

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:02.941
PIECES OF THE TESTIMONY CHAU

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:06.511
THAT THIS IS A MOVING TARGET R.

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:08.880
AND THE QUESTION IS DO WE WISH

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:11.483
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND DO WE

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.218
WISH TO MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.486
THAT MIGHT BE COMING FROM OTHER

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:16.288
SOURCES AND I THINK THE ANSWER

00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:19.658
IS YES AND- THE REAL ISSUE IS

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:22.027
THAT THE AUTHOR. IN TAKING THIS

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:24.429
ON WHICH IN SOME WAYS THANK

00:24:24.496 --> 00:24:27.098
WORSE ARE GIVES US THE VEHICLE

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:28.834
TO ADDRESS THESE AS THE

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.302
DIFFERENT PIECES FALL INTO PLACE

00:24:30.368 --> 00:24:31.536
SO AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:33.238
WILL BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.973
OKAY WILL RECOGNIZE THAT IS A

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.408
MOTION- DO ANY OTHER MEMBERS

SEEING NONE I'LL MAKE A QUICK

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:44.149
COMMENT THE ONE OTHER POINT I

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:46.117
WOULD JUST READ. IN THE IT WAS

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:48.620
NOT IN THE AND NOW. BUT A LITTLE

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:50.355
BIT OF THE BACK. IN AB ONE

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:51.223
REASONS I ATTENDED EMPATHIZE

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:52.791
SOMEWHAT WITH THE INDEPENDENT

00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:53.792
PRODUCERS CONCERNS. IS THAT THE

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:56.328
INDUSTRY ITSELF. EVAN IS

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:58.263
STRUCTURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.001
ALL OPERATORS. LIABILITIES CEASE

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:05.103

LEGISLATURE BACK THEN- BELIEVE

00:25:09.407 --> 00:25:11.443
IT WAS A GYM COSTABILE- NOW

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:14.546
CONGRESSMAN COSTA- EXEMPTING ALL

PREVIOUS OWNERS FROM LIABILITY.

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.016

TAKING CONTROL OF THOSE ASSETS

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:23.588
GOING FORWARD- END UP BEING THE

IF THEY GO BANKRUPT IT'S ON THE

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:30.228
TAXPAYERS SO I THINK PART OF.

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:32.831
PART OF BEING ABLE TO LAND THIS

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:33.965
ISSUE IS ALSO MAKING SURE WE

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:36.134
HAVE AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.570
OF RESPONSIBILITIES- BETWEEN THE

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:40.538
INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAJORS WHO-

HOWARD JARVIS WHETHER OR NOT.

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:35.037
BECAUSE AT LEAST FROM THE PAID

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.639
SIGNATURE GATHERS THAT I'VE BEEN

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:37.273
MONITORING YOUR YOUR CERTAIN

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:39.208
JUST A VOLUNTEER BASIS SO I

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.943
DON'T HAVE ANY DATA ON THAT. BUT

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.178
I WANT TO GET SOME SENSE AS TO

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:44.647
WHERE YOU WERE IN THAT PROCESS

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:45.814

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:50.853
SIGNATURES THAT HAVE TO BE

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.788
QUALIFIED WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:53.422
TO GET THEM INTO. I JUST WANTED

01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:55.958
THE FIRST PART OF MY INQUIRY

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:59.061
RELATES TO THE PROBABILITY OF

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:00.930
THIS EVEN BEING RELEVANT. SO I

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:02.531
THINK THAT'S A QUESTION OF THE

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:03.933
AUTHORS LEAD TESTIMONY THAT'S

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:06.835

THE PETITIONS OUT THERE RIGHT

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.139
NOW- YOU'RE CORRECT THAT WE HAVE

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.808
NOT RECEIVED 25% IN HAND I THINK

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:13.909
THIS AS YOU SAID VOLUNTEER

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:15.210
EFFORT I THINK THE MINDSET IS

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.979
DIFFERENT FROM PAID SEARCH YOUR

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.247
CAMPAIGN WORDS. THEY'RE PAID

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:18.948
RETURN SIGNATURE SO THE

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:20.115
INCENTIVES RETURN SIGNATURES I

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:21.750
THINK HERE THE INCENTIVE IS TO

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:23.419
QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT AND WE'RE

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:25.220
SEEING THAT OUR OUR VOLUNTEERS

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:27.423
ARE HOLDING ON TO SIGNATURES FOR

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:28.991
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND SENDING

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.125
BACK IN AND GREATER. ARE COMING

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:31.961
BACK GREATER NOW- WE STILL

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:32.928
BELIEVE WE HAVE ENOUGH

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:35.464
SIGNATURES OTHERS QUALIFY. I

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:37.900
GUESS CAN PART OF THE CORE. YES

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.234
RELATED WAS ALLUDED TO BY THE

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.836
FIVE. BUT THIS MEASURE-

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:43.005
RECORDING TO THE REALTORS WILL

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.307
PRODUCE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:46.275
THOUSAND HOUSEHOLD TRANSFERS A

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:49.111
YEAR. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:50.579
. NOW THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THOSE

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:52.581
AS IT RELATES TO MONEY TO GROW

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:53.349
IN THE COUNTY I LIVE IN LOS

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:55.017
ANGELES COUNTY USERS WILL BE A

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.885
HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:58.687
WHAT HAPPENS IS LET'S ASSUME

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:00.289
THAT- MRS MOSKOWITZ BOUGHT A

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:03.359

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:05.094
IT WAS PRE SEVENTY EIGHT SHE

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.963
BOUGHT THE HOUSE SAY FOR TWENTY

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.998
THOUSAND TODAY THE HOUSE IS

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:10.466
WORTH TWO MILLION- CERTAINLY THE

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:11.900
TAX BILL IS MAYBE A THOUSAND

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:13.969
DOLLARS IS BEST. IF SHE SELLS IT

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:16.905
IS WORTH TWO MILLION THE TAX

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:17.973
BILLS TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.208
FOR THE NEW FAMILY THAT MOVES

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:20.743
IN. AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE.

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.778
HUGE AMOUNTS TO REVENUES ARE

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:26.382
PROJECTED. I'M JUST THE- THE IN

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:27.683
. DEALING WITH THE ARGUMENT WAS

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.952
MADE BY MR SCHUMER'S. IS IT FOR

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.654
ALL THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.155
GOING TO HAVE THESE TURNOVERS

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:34.857
AND NEW FAMILIES YOU CAN HAVE

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:35.958
OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY AND MOVE

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:37.660
INTO THESE HOMES SO IN ADDITION

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.361
EVEN IF YOU HAVE A REVENUE

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:40.996
STREAM WHICH- ASK SPECIFICALLY

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:42.064
ANY CREATING OUT OF THE GENERAL

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.099
FUND MANY ME TAKING MONEY FROM.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:45.367

TAKING MONEY FROM PRESCHOOL IT

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:48.871
MEANS YOU'RE TAKING MONEY FROM

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.440
ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT COME ON

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:53.008
THE GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW WE

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.043
HAVE MONEY BUT I'VE LIVED

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.344
THROUGH A TIME. AND HAD MONEY IN

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.979
EVERY NICKEL MAPPERS SO WHAT

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:58.681
YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE TAKING

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:00.849
AND IF THIS WOULD BE THE LAW THE

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.051
TWO POINTS OR REYES AND ASK YOUR

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:04.386
IN QUERY ON OUR ONE THE CROWDING

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:05.654
OUT OF THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENT

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:06.822
TO PROVIDE OTHER ESSENTIAL

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:08.624
SERVICES DEGREE SAFETY THAT'S

01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:10.926
WHEN BOTH OF YOU AND I HAVE BEEN

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.027
TO DOWNTURNS. AND THE SECOND IS

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:14.797
THE REVENUE STREAM RELATING TO A

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.598
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE FACT

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.100
THAT THIS WAS DESIGNED IN LARGE

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.368
MEASURE SUPPORTED BY MANY LOCAL

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:21.136
GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE IT PROVIDED

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:22.471
A REVENUE STREAM BY VIRTUE OF

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:24.640
UNLOCKING THAT THOSE TAX DOLLARS

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:26.842
AND THAT EQUITY IN THOSE HOMES

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:30.646
YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE TWO ISSUES

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:31.213

PRIORITY EVERYTHING IS A MATTER

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:37.820
OF PRIORITY. AND WHAT WOULD BE

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:40.289
MORE OF A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:43.592
LIFE AND PROPERTY. AND WILDLIFE.

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.894
THAT'S VERY MUCH SHIBLEY MY

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.930
ANSWER THAT THIS OUGHT TO BE

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.865
NECESSARILY WOULD BE AND WE

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:52.668
CAN'T JUST GRIEVE AND WRING OUR

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.236
HANDS WHEN THE FIRES HIT. THEY

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:58.574
WILL HIT. RECENT HEADLINE

ARTICLE IN THE- TO BE. THIS YEAR

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:08.450
THAT'S AN ASSURANCE THAT IS IN

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:11.353
THE MAY BE. AND IT IS IN THE MAY

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.589
BE EITHER THAT WE HAVE NOT

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:14.690
NEGLECTED WE HAVE INDEED

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:16.625
NEGLECTED REMOVING THE FUEL

WILL ARGUE. TO MY COLLEAGUES

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:31.907
THAT IS A PRIORITY OF GOVERNMENT

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.942
. AND THE ASSURANCE OF SUPPLIES

01:13:34.009 --> 01:13:36.044
IS IMPORTANT PARTICULAR IN THIS

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:39.982
AREA. PERSONNEL. AND CAPITAL

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:43.685

ABOUT THE FIREFIGHTERS

OPPOSITION HERE I THINK THEY

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.229
HAVE OTHER MOTIVES PARTICULARLY

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.931
IN THAT THEY ONLY THIS VERY

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:57.966

CENTRAL POINT MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:41.777
BERKELEY FOR EXAMPLE. AND OTHER

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:45.214
COMMUNITIES. THAT OTHER MEMBERS

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.882
TESTIFYING HERE TODAY HAVE

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:48.884
MENTIONED ONE OF WHICH I USED TO

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:51.253
REPRESENT. WE DIDN'T USED TO

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.088
HAVE A FIRE PROBLEMS LIKE THIS

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:58.660
IN SANTA ROSA. NOW WE DO. THIS

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.829
COME IN THE URBAN INTERFACE.

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:02.998
IT'S GOING TO BE THERE IT IS

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.434
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. SO IF YOU

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.102
WANT TO ARGUE WITH ME THAT WE

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.871
COULD BETTER DEPLOYED FIRE

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:11.006
PREVENTION RESOURCES THAT'S A

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:14.576
CONVERSATION. THAT IS JUST. BUT

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.979
TO SAY THAT WE HAVE OTHER

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:18.747
PRIORITIES. I THINK THAT'S KIND

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.782
OF A HOLLOW ARGUMENT. IT DOESN'T

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:24.019
BEAR WEIGHT. TO THE CITIZENS WHO

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:25.921
LOST EVERYTHING AND I MEAN

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:29.124
EVERYTHING. I WAS PRESENT ON

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:32.895
SCENE AN ON SITE FOR THE

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:35.197
PARADISE FIRE. PEOPLE LOST

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:38.033
EVERYTHING. AND I REMEMBER

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.802
STANDING THERE ONE NIGHT. WITH

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:45.974
THE POLICE CHIEF. THEY SAID JIM

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:47.276
. MY HOME WAS BURNING AS I STAND

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:52.848
HERE. SO IT IS A PRIORITY AND

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:54.182
THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWERS CAN I

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.817
SHOULD ONE FOLLOW INSTRUMENT

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:56.385
SURE YEAH I JUST WANNA SAY I

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.820
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. AND

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:02.424
I- IT IS A PRIORITY IS REALLY

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:03.959
IMPORTANT. THE ONLY QUESTION I

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:06.328
WAS TRYING TO ASK IS WE ALREADY

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:06.828
HAVE PAID FOR IT. YOUR

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.497
LEGISLATION DOESN'T SAY. YOU'RE

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:10.098
LEGISLATION DOESN'T WE HAVE A

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:11.767
REVENUE STREAM YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:13.235
ELIMINATE THAT REVENUE STREAM OR

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.070
REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER ONE.

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:17.539
BECAUSE YOU YOU KNOW THE ONES OF

01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:18.740
PORTER'S PROPOSITION. THERE

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:20.175
ISN'T EVERY DOLLAR IN YOUR

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:21.777
PROPERTY HERE MEASURES ICS

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:22.811
BECAUSE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:24.379
ABOUT THIS MAKING A PRIORITY AND

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:26.014
THAT'S THE REASON WHY PROP

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.349
NINETEEN PASSED IN LARGE MEASURE

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:28.350
IN MY JUDGMENT I THINK YOU'RE

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.019
CORRECT. THE TEST IS NOT WHETHER

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:32.654
WE HAVE THE REVENUE NECESSARYTO

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:34.589
SUPPORT FIRE WHICH OF COURSE

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.658
THIS MEASURE DOES THAT'S THE LAW

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:38.727
NOW. SUPPORTED BY THE VOTERS THE

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:40.162
TEST IS YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:42.431
REVENUE STREAM AND REPLACE IT

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:44.032
WITH GENERAL FUNDS THAT THAT HAS

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.101
AN IMPACT THAT WAS THE POINT. SO

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.836
YOU'RE A 100% RIGHT AND I

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:48.971
COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE IN TERMS

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:50.906
OF IT BEING A PRIORITY I'M JUST

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:54.109
LOOKING AT WHAT THE REQUIRE OUT

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:56.378
SHOULD BE PAID FOR. OKAY THANK

01:16:56.445 --> 01:17:00.182
YOU- SIR ALAN. YEAH I'M I I'M

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:01.850
I'M OF MANY MINDS OF THIS AYE

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:02.951
I'M CERTAINLY OF A VERY

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:04.353
DIFFERENT OPINION ABOUT THE

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:05.854
MERITS OF PROP NINETEEN THEN MY

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.089
COLLEAGUE- BUT I THINK THAT HE

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.991
BRINGS UP A LOT OF REALLY GOOD

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:10.225
POINTS ABOUT HOW WE'RE BASICALLY

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:11.927
JUST SHIFTING CHAIRS ON THE ON

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:13.962
THE DECK HERE- WITH REGARDS TO

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:16.565
PAYMENT I'M I'M SO CAN I I'D

01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:17.933
LIKE TO GET SOME MORE. I WAS ONE

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.068
OF YOU PEOPLE DID NOT VOTE TO

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:21.937
PUT PRIDE NINETEEN ON THE BALLOT

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:22.938
ON MY SIDE OF THE AISLE AND

01:17:23.005 --> 01:17:24.973
BECAUSE I SAW THAT IT REALLY-

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.709
WHILE IT WAS PUSHED AS SOMETHING

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:30.779
TO HELP- YOU KNOW FOLKS WHO

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.481
WANTED TO. DOWNSIZE IN A

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:34.816
DIFFERENT COUNTY- AND THEN OF

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:36.251
COURSE THE ADS WERE ALL FOCUSED

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:39.921
ON VERY WEALTHY- INHERITORS WHO

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:42.090
YOU KNOW WANTED TO MAKE A BIG

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.459
INCOME OFF OF- OFF OF. RENTING

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:46.428
OUT A PLACE THAT THEY INHERITED.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.430
I'M THE MEASURE ALSO HAD THE

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.399
OTHER IMPACT WHICH IS THAT- YOU

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:51.900
KNOW FOLKS WHO INHERITED THEIR

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:53.268
PROPERTIES WHO WANTED TO MOVE

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:55.537
INTO THE PROPERTIES OF THEIR

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:57.706
PARENTS. WE'RE WE'RE SCREWED

01:17:57.773 --> 01:17:58.940
FIVE FIVE BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THE

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:00.142
PROPERTY VALUES HAVE INCREASED

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.777
SO SIGNIFICANTLY SO THAT'S- THAT

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:04.346
YEAH THAT THAT WAS. IT I WAS MY-

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:05.247
PROBLEM WITH WITH THE WAY WAS

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:07.416
FRAME UNFORTUNATELY- THAT THAT

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:08.583
PIECE OF THE STORY WAS NEVER

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.419
REALLY GOING TO AMPLY DISCUSSED

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:11.820
AND- IT'S TRUE DID PASSED. THE

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.789
ELECTORATE BUT IT WAS A VERY

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.090
SLIM MAJORITY I MEAN FIFTY ONE

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:16.658
TO FORTY NINE. SO 'D LIKE TO

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.060
GET A BETTER SENSE THOUGH AS TO

01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:19.861
WHAT EXACTLY THE PROPOSAL IS I

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.229
MEAN I HAVEN'T BEEN MADE AWARE

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:23.698
I'D LOVE TO ASK- OUR FRIEND FROM

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:24.399
THE JARVIS'S ASSOCIATION- IT

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:25.300
SAYS THE ANNOUNCES THAT. THE

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:27.836
REPEAL THE DEATH TAX ACT APPEARS

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:29.738
TO REPEAL MUCH OF PROP NINETEEN.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:32.407
BUT IT IS IT DOESN'T REPEAL ALL

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:34.543
AGES REVEALS SOME. AND THEN I

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:36.078
THINK IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:36.545
IT'S POTENTIALLY VERY

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:37.879
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT REALLY

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:40.415
DOES START TO GET US INTO A- UP.

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:45.954
A REVENUE. PROBLEM I GUESS IS

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:48.623
THAT IS THAT CORRECT. WE ARE

01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:50.559
REALLY TO INTERRACIAL. BURKE IT

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:53.361
REMOVE THAT IN DOING SO IT.

01:18:53.428 --> 01:18:55.163
FOR. THAT RICK. A YOU TO THE OF

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:56.832
CALCULATION THE PORTABILITY

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:57.966
ASPECT. ASPECT ANY IF THERE'S A

01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:59.167
COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE THAT

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.969
COST SAVINGS GOES IN THE

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:01.369
WILDFIRE FUND OUT

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:02.804
INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFER THAT

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:04.606
CALCULATION CAN'T BE MADE. SO

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:06.875
OUR BILL WHICH IS WHAT YOU DO IN

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:08.510
THAT INSTANCE STORY PLACING ONE

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:09.611
TWENTY THREE WITH ANOTHER. I

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:11.046
WOULD SAY THE PORTABILITY PART A

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:12.280
BIT BUSY MAYBE SAVE YOUR

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:13.515
PLACEMENT FINISHING ANOTHER.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.717
IT'S NOT CREATING NEW REVENUE TO

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:17.853
PAY FOR. RIGHT SO YOU'RE JUST

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:22.324
TAKING. MONEY OUT OF THE GENERAL

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:23.492
FUND. OKAY SERVICES THAT HURTS

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:25.360
CONCERNS WERE OUT WORK I'M NOT

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:26.628

CORRECT GOTCHA OKAY AND I'M

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.599
SIDING. BUT I- IN THE AND THEN

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:31.900
AND I IF THERE IS ANY LOSSES IN

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.636
REVENUE TO COUNTIES- HER DRIVING

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:35.403
FROM IN OUR INITIATIVE

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.039
OBVIOUSLY- IN OR IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:39.508
LOSSES OF THE COUNTIES. DRIVING

01:19:39.574 --> 01:19:40.609
FROM THE PORTABILITY ASPECT THAT

01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:42.277
WOULD BE ALSO BACKED UP BY STATE

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:45.080
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S INITIATIVE

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:46.181
THAT'S NOT. WHAT'S BEFORE YOU

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:47.349
TODAY. I MEAN OLD ULTIMATELY THE

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.151
INITIATIVE IS IN THE HANDS OF

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:50.852
THE VOTERS RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:52.487
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A FUNDING.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:53.388
FORMULA FR. THE FIREFIGHTERS.

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.023
SHOULD OUR INITIATIVE PASS AND

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:55.524
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.125
DISCUSSION BUT NO WHY DO WE NEED

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:59.794
I MEAN IF WE FUND. FIREFIGHTING

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:01.296
EFFORTS. ALREADY WHY WOULD WE

01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:03.765
NEED TO CONTINUE TO GET

01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:04.666
GUARANTEED CONTINUES A

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:06.101
PREPARATION WHEN. THAT'S A BUT

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:07.402
WHEN WE FIND FIREFIGHTING

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.804
EFFORTS AS A MATTER OF COURSE.

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:10.739
THE WHITE WHITE WHY IS THIS

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:15.443
NECESSARY. WELL IT. FROM

DEDICATED FUNDING STREAM THAT'S

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:22.817
ONE PERCENTAGE- FUND IT'S

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:24.819
CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN WHAT PROP

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:26.321
NINETEEN IS THE WHAT WHY WOULD

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:28.089
THIS HAVE TO IT WHY WOULD HAVE

AGRICULTURE SUPPORTED THE

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:43.812
COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA

01:24:43.878 --> 01:24:47.916
ABOUT. THE MECHANICS OF PROP

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:50.151
NINETEEN AND EVEN BEYOND THE

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:56.891
EQUITY IN- RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUES

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:58.426
THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM. THIS

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:02.397
INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFER TAX-

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:03.865
FOR BUILDING INTERGENERATIONAL

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:05.934
WEALTH WHICH I'VE HEARD A LOT

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.002
ABOUT FROM THE DISTRICT FROM

01:25:08.069 --> 01:25:11.906
WORKING PEOPLE- AND FRANKLY- I

01:25:11.973 --> 01:25:13.775
SHOULD'VE DONE MORE HOMEWORK-

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:16.444
WHEN VOTING ON THIS A. C. A.

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:17.645
WHEN I WAS MOVING THROUGH THE

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:20.048
LEGISLATURE WAS A- LATE DEAL AND

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:24.452
CAME TOGETHER AND- I'M- AND IT

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:26.855
WAS SOLD A CERTAIN WAY TO THE

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:28.990
VOTERS AND YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS A

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:32.227
LITTLE SKEPTICAL WHEN. WE USE

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:34.562
THE POLITICS OF FIRE. AND THE

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:37.699
SACRED DUTY THAT WE HAVE TO.

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:39.801
FULFILL OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:44.072
OUR FIREFIGHTERS- AND USE THAT

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:46.808
AS A SALES PITCH TO VOTERS- YOU

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:49.611
KNOW I IN TERMS OF THIS MEASURE

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:51.980
WE TRIED TO IN THE AMENDMENTS AT

01:25:52.046 --> 01:25:55.350
LEAST MATCH EXACTLY HOW PROP

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:56.751
NINETEEN WAS WORK FOR THE

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.887
FIREFIGHTERS SO THAT THERE WOULD

01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:02.824
BE. NO CONSEQUENCE IN INACTION

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:05.393
IN IN ACTUALITY THIS IT ACTUALLY

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.996
COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

01:26:08.062 --> 01:26:10.899
IN IN WHAT'S EXPECTED FROM PROP

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.333
NINETEEN I'M FOR THOSE FUNDS I

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.434
WAS WONDERING I DON'T KNOW

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.169
WHETHER THE AUTHOR OR THE

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:16.971
SPONSOR HAVE ANY INFORMATION OR

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.573
I THINK CAL FIRE CHIEFS ARE ALSO

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.909
IN SUPPORT THE FIRE CHIEFS

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:22.777
ASSOCIATION OF FIRE DISTRICTS AS

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.012
ASIAN CALIFORNIA GIVE A SENSE OF

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:27.181
HOW THE 1% NUMBER OF CORRELATES

01:26:27.248 --> 01:26:28.917
TO THE ANTICIPATED I KNOW IT'S

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:30.952
NOT YET KNOWN HOW HOW MUCH THAT

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:31.619
INTERGENERATIONAL TAX WOULD

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:35.056
RESULT IN BUT THERE ANY GENERAL

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.491
ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW IS THERE A

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:38.826
WAY TO SORT OF. TAYLOR THIS BILL

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:40.161
A LITTLE MORE NARROWLY SO THAT

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:41.095
IT DOESN'T FEEL. SO OPEN ENDED

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:42.530
AND MAYBE AN OVER ALLOCATION OR

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:43.998
TYING THE HANDS OF THE

01:26:44.065 --> 01:26:45.867
LEGISLATURE BUT SOME WAY TO. TO

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:46.868
MAKE THE AMOUNT SORT OF

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:49.003
PROPORTIONAL TO THE ANTICIPATED

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.940
LOSS FROM THE REPEAL. THE L. A.

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:53.274
I BELIEVE ESTIMATED AT TENS OF

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:54.609
MILLIONS UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:56.010
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS ON THIS

01:26:56.077 --> 01:26:57.478
OBVIOUSLY BE MORE THAN A BILLION

01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:59.614
DOLLARS A YEAR 1% AT CURRENT

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:02.116
RATES- WE YEP WE WOULD BE HAVING

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:03.251
WE ARE OPEN TO. ALL

01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:05.153
CONVERSATIONS ON THIS. SO I

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:07.221
THINK I'M MOST ASSURED THEM TO

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:08.790
MR MR OKAY WELL THAT THAT

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:09.924
ACTUALLY THAT'S QUITE HELPFUL

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:12.627
BECAUSE IF THERE'S AT LEAST A

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.395
WAY TO DEAL WITH- THE TAILORING

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:16.030
OF WHAT WHAT WE MAY CALL THE

01:27:16.097 --> 01:27:18.933
BACK. FROM OF A MORE NARROW

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.435
REPEAL. AND I THINKTHAT COULD

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:22.637
HELP POTENTIALLY WITH. THE SWORD

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:24.939
ON THE ONGOING QUESTION OF ARE

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:26.174
WE LOCKING OURSELVES INTO THE

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.575
RIGHT STRUCTURE FUNDS. I WILL

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:29.344
NOTE HOWEVER WE JUST VOTED ON A

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.845
MEASURE THAT WOULD LOCK IN

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:33.314
SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF FUND FOR

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.149
ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS THAT I WAS

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:37.852
VERY PROUD TO HELP. WITH AND

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.988
CRUCIAL THAT WE DO TO MAKE THAT

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:42.023
FUNDING SO IN SOME WAYS THIS

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.891
MEASURE COULD WORK IN CONCERT

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.960
WITH THE MAJORITY LEADER'S BILL-

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:49.797
AS AN ONGOING SOURCE- BUT- THE

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:51.733
ONE OTHER QUESTION I HAD SO. WE

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:54.636
WE'VE MIRRORED- THE PROP

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:56.304
NINETEEN FIRE MECHANICS IN IN

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:57.372
THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU AGREED

01:27:57.438 --> 01:28:00.775
TO- BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:04.078
A WAY TO- TO SORT OF LET THE-

01:28:04.145 --> 01:28:06.114
SIGNATURE GATHERING PLAY OUT AND

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.282
NOT NECESSARILY AT THIS POINT.

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:10.852
LINK THE MEASURE. TO THAT BALLOT

01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:12.887
PROPOSITION I HEARD THE CONCERNS

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:13.454
OF. THE PROFESSIONAL

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:14.956
FIREFIGHTERS AND ALL THE

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.591
KNOWLEDGE THE LATE HOUR ON THOSE

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:19.627
THOSE- THOSE CONCERNS REYES AND

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:21.562
DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR- FOR

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:25.333
HIS FRUSTRATION WITH THAT. BUT-

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.536
BUT I WONDER IF WE WERE ABLE TO

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:33.641
FOR THE TIME BEING- D. LINK

01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:37.912
THESE TWO SO- D. LINK. S. C.

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.414
EIGHT EIGHT FROM THE SIGNATURE

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:41.983
GATHERING EFFORT I'M LOOKING I

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:45.887
THINK SPECIFICALLY AT SECTION.

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:46.921
TWO OF THE BILL WHICH HAS A

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:48.990
BLANK IN IT RIGHT NOW IT SAYS

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.124
THIS MEASURE SHALL ONLY TAKE

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:52.794
EFFECT IF BOTH THIS MEASURE AND

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.228

MENTIONED IN THE OVER ARCHING

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:12.927

WALK IN- OF THAT TO A CERTAIN

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.353
GROUP OF PEOPLE AND IT DOESN'T

REPRESENT PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:42.490
OR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE STRONGLY

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:43.991
IN THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:46.928
AND IT KEEPS THEM OUT OF ASSESS

01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:49.063
ABILITY TO HOUSING B. BECAUSE OF

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:51.899
THAT. HAT HAVING SAID THAT THIS

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:54.168
IS SO COMPLEX AND IT GETS MORE

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:56.971

VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:54.260
FOR JUST THOSE REASONS SOMETHING

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:57.630

FOR GETTING GRANTS IT'S

01:58:58.965 --> 01:59:01.567
COMPLICATED IT'S LABORIOUS IT

01:59:01.634 --> 01:59:04.470
TAKES YEARS. LONGER THAN YOU'VE

01:59:04.537 --> 01:59:06.506

WHERE IT'S NECESSARY HOWEVER. IT

01:59:18.618 --> 01:59:21.020

02:14:52.150 --> 02:14:54.019
THE ADVOCATES FOR THE BILL ON

02:14:54.085 --> 02:14:55.687
AMENDED SAID WE NEED TO BE

02:14:55.754 --> 02:14:57.956
BUILDING DAM WE NEED TO BE

02:14:58.023 --> 02:14:59.191
FUNDING MONEY FOR MORE

02:14:59.257 --> 02:15:02.060
INFRASTRUCTURE. NONE OF THAT IS

02:15:02.127 --> 02:15:03.295
WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE AGENCY

02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:05.497
WHETHER IT'S MOVED OR NOT BUT

02:15:05.564 --> 02:15:07.532
THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN ARGUMENT.

02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:10.869
FOR BLOWING IT UP THERE WAS

02:15:10.936 --> 02:15:12.370
ANOTHER COMMENT THAT. WHAT

02:15:12.437 --> 02:15:14.739
REGARD TO WATER GRANTS AND CLEAN

02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:16.308
WATER GRANTS THAT IT TOOK TWENTY

02:15:16.374 --> 02:15:17.976
YEARS WHILE THE CLEAN WATER

02:15:18.043 --> 02:15:19.311
PROGRAM IS ONLY BEEN IN THE

02:15:19.377 --> 02:15:21.213
WATER BOARD FOR THREE OR FOUR

02:15:21.279 --> 02:15:23.882
YEARS. OF SO IT WAS SORT OF THAT

02:15:23.949 --> 02:15:25.951
WAS THE REASON IT WAS MOVED IS

02:15:26.017 --> 02:15:28.320
THE PREVIOUS LOCATION OF THAT

02:15:28.386 --> 02:15:30.856
GRANTS PROGRAM WAS NOT GETTING

02:15:30.922 --> 02:15:32.290
THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR AND THE

02:15:32.357 --> 02:15:35.193
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT SHOWS.

02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.328
THAT THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED

02:15:36.394 --> 02:15:38.230
SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE MOVE

02:15:38.296 --> 02:15:39.965
BETWEEN THE AGENCIES. AND I

02:15:40.031 --> 02:15:42.901
THINK WHAT'S AT THE ROOT OF THIS

02:15:42.968 --> 02:15:44.903
IS THE VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION.

02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:47.873
THAT HELLO I HAVE RIGHTS TO MORE

02:15:47.939 --> 02:15:50.976
WATER IN CALIFORNIA THAT EXISTS

02:15:51.042 --> 02:15:54.179
AND THEN WE GIVE AN AGENCY THE

02:15:54.246 --> 02:15:56.982
OBLIGATION TO MEDIATE THAT

02:15:57.048 --> 02:16:00.886
SITUATION. AND IN AUSTRALIA WHEN

02:16:00.952 --> 02:16:02.754
THEY HAVE THE NINE YEAR DROUGHT.

02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:05.090
THEY ACTUALLY REVAMPED THE WATER

02:16:05.156 --> 02:16:08.693
RIGHTS SYSTEM. AND THEY DECIDED

02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:09.995
THEY WOULD ASSIGN A CERTAIN

02:16:10.061 --> 02:16:11.930
AMOUNT TO AGRICULTURE A CERTAIN

02:16:11.997 --> 02:16:13.632
AMOUNT TO MUNICIPAL A CERTAIN

02:16:13.698 --> 02:16:15.400
AMOUNT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:17.569
HAVE IT MATCH WHAT THE NEEDS

02:16:17.636 --> 02:16:19.838
WERE AND WHERE THE WATER WAS.

02:16:19.905 --> 02:16:22.841
AND WE HAVE AN ANTIQUATED SYSTEM

02:16:22.908 --> 02:16:25.477
THAT DOESN'T GIVE OF RIGHTS TO

02:16:25.544 --> 02:16:27.946
PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT THEY WANT

02:16:28.013 --> 02:16:29.781
TO CONSERVE OR THAT THEY CAN

02:16:29.848 --> 02:16:30.982
TAKE MORE THAN MIGHT BE

02:16:31.049 --> 02:16:32.684
AVAILABLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:35.620
AND OTHER THINGS AND SO. I THINK

02:16:35.687 --> 02:16:37.856
THAT THE PROPER LEGISLATIVE WAY

02:16:37.923 --> 02:16:41.026
TO GO IS WHAT IN THIS MOTION

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:43.628
BECAUSE IT IS WE SHOULD STAND

02:16:43.695 --> 02:16:44.729
BACK FROM JUST ASSUMING THAT

02:16:44.796 --> 02:16:46.565
BLOWING UP AN AGENCY IS THE

02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:50.368
ANSWER TO ALL OUR- OUR CONCERNS.

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:51.703
BUT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION TO

ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND THEN

02:16:53.672 --> 02:16:54.906
DECIDE WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS AND

02:16:54.973 --> 02:16:57.809
THAT'S WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING

02:16:57.876 --> 02:16:58.977

HORRIBLE CHALLENGES OVER WATER

BUT THE FARMERS NEEDED OF COURSE

02:27:23.868 --> 02:27:25.536
TO PRODUCE EXTRAORDINARY CROPS

02:27:25.603 --> 02:27:27.305

CHANGING THOSE INDOOR NUMBERS

02:28:27.865 --> 02:28:29.333
NOW THERE'S SOME CRITICISM THAT

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.202

THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:38.309
IS A GREAT SOUND BITE BUT IT'S

02:28:38.376 --> 02:28:39.777
NOT TRUE. AND I KNOW THAT THEIR

02:28:39.844 --> 02:28:40.878
SOMETIMES TO STILL MATTERS IN

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:42.713
THIS BUSINESS WHAT IT DOES IS WE

02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:44.382
ALREADY EXCEEDING SOME OF THOSE

02:28:44.448 --> 02:28:45.850
STANDARDS AND IT'S SUCH A- IT'S

02:28:45.916 --> 02:28:47.852
SUCH A BROAD STANDARD OF WHAT

02:28:47.918 --> 02:28:49.220
INTO IT WOULD YOU SHOULD SHOULD

02:28:49.287 --> 02:28:51.555
BE NOT. INDIVIDUALLY BUT SYSTEM

POTABLE REUSE AND ALL SORTS OF

02:28:55.993 --> 02:28:57.762
THINGS LIKE THAT. IS IT GONNA BE

02:28:57.828 --> 02:28:59.330
MORE EXPENSIVE SOME OF THE

02:28:59.397 --> 02:29:00.931
OPPOSITION SAID NOTHING'S LESS

02:29:00.998 --> 02:29:03.401
EXPENSIVE THAN CONSERVATION. YOU

WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:29:07.004 --> 02:29:11.075
WATER IF WE AS A STATE DON'T SET

02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:13.044

OF- WATER CONSERVATION I THINK

02:43:57.027 --> 02:43:59.196
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY.

02:43:59.262 --> 02:44:01.031
NOW IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I

02:44:01.097 --> 02:44:02.899

SENDING ONE IN PARTICULAR I WANT

02:44:25.589 --> 02:44:27.991
TO STATE THAT EVEN PRIOR TO THE

02:44:28.058 --> 02:44:30.627
BEGINNING IN THE NINETIES- WHEN

02:44:30.694 --> 02:44:33.763
THERE WAS- MASSIVE- TRANSFER

02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:35.065
WATER THAT WAS THAT SHOULD HAVE

02:44:35.131 --> 02:44:36.900
BEEN DESTINED FOR SAN DIEGO BUT

02:44:36.967 --> 02:44:39.135
METRO DECIDED TO KEEP THAT THE

02:44:39.202 --> 02:44:41.771
LA AREA. IT FOR SAN DIEGO TO

02:44:41.838 --> 02:44:42.872
CONSERVE IN WAYS THAT OTHER

02:44:42.939 --> 02:44:44.874
PARTS OF THE STATE. HAVE NOT

02:44:44.941 --> 02:44:47.177
CONSERVED AND AS FAR SAN DIEGO

02:44:47.244 --> 02:44:48.845
THEY HAVE TAKEN ON VERY

02:44:48.912 --> 02:44:50.413
AGGRESSIVE CONSERVATION POLICIES

02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:55.418
THROUGH. THE THROUGH THE DROUGHT

02:44:55.485 --> 02:44:57.988
SENEGAL FARED FAIRLY WELL IN

02:44:58.054 --> 02:44:59.889
COMPARISON TO THE WRIST REST OF

02:44:59.956 --> 02:45:01.524
THE STATE. IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE

02:45:01.591 --> 02:45:03.526
SERVED IN GOVERNMENT- I'M VERY

02:45:03.593 --> 02:45:04.794
PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE WORKED

02:45:04.861 --> 02:45:07.998
ON- MAKING IN SAN DIEGO A CITY

02:45:08.064 --> 02:45:11.001
THAT RECYCLES ITS WATER. SO NOW

02:45:11.067 --> 02:45:13.370
SAN DIEGO IS UNDERTAKING-

02:45:13.436 --> 02:45:15.972
SUBSTANTIAL WATER RECYCLING

02:45:16.039 --> 02:45:19.276
THAT'S A AND RE USE. AND WE HAVE

02:45:19.342 --> 02:45:24.147
SEVERAL- WATER DISTRICTS

02:45:24.214 --> 02:45:26.750
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY THAT ARE

02:45:26.816 --> 02:45:29.519
NOW ENGAGING IN WATER REUSE WE

02:45:29.586 --> 02:45:31.921
HAVE PURPLE PIPE THAT'S BEEN

02:45:31.988 --> 02:45:35.258
INSTALLED AND IN THE LAST

02:45:35.325 --> 02:45:37.260
FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE ALSO CREATED

02:45:37.327 --> 02:45:40.030
A T. CELL FACILITY- IN THE

02:45:40.096 --> 02:45:41.698
CARLSBAD AREA THAT'S PROVIDING

02:45:41.765 --> 02:45:43.900
QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

02:45:43.967 --> 02:45:46.303
WATER TO SAN DIEGO SO. AT AS WE

02:45:46.369 --> 02:45:47.871
STAND IN SAN DIEGO THE SEWER

02:45:47.937 --> 02:45:54.010
SYSTEM AND IT IS IT'S AT ITS-

02:45:54.077 --> 02:45:56.980
POINT OF IF WE REDUCE WATER

02:45:57.047 --> 02:45:59.816
FLOWS LITERALLY THE US THE

02:45:59.883 --> 02:46:01.885
SEWAGE THAT OUR PIPES KERRY WILL

02:46:01.951 --> 02:46:04.788
NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THEIR

02:46:04.854 --> 02:46:06.723
DESTINATION. AND THAT IS

02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:08.491
SOMETHING THAT IS A CRITICAL

02:46:08.558 --> 02:46:09.726
ISSUE FOR SAN DIEGO AS WELL

02:46:09.793 --> 02:46:11.528
IT'LL INCREASE MAINTENANCE COSTS

02:46:11.594 --> 02:46:13.096
RE RECORD REGARDING OUR OUR

02:46:13.163 --> 02:46:15.532
SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS. SO SEND

02:46:15.598 --> 02:46:17.667
YOU HAS REACHED A BALANCE IN

02:46:17.734 --> 02:46:19.602
TERMS OF HOW IT MANAGES ITS

02:46:19.669 --> 02:46:21.738
SEWAGE HOW IT SOURCES ITS WATER

02:46:21.805 --> 02:46:23.673
IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY

02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:27.844
WAY AND IT'S- STILL. UNDERTAKING

02:46:27.911 --> 02:46:30.013
A VERY AGGRESSIVE CONSERVATION

02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:33.149
STRATEGIES SO- YOU KNOW I'M I'M

02:46:33.216 --> 02:46:35.785
CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL. WILL

02:46:35.852 --> 02:46:36.653
HAVE SOME UNINTENDED

02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:38.421
CONSEQUENCES OF SAN DIEGO OF

02:46:38.488 --> 02:46:40.990
AFFECTING OUR OUR WASTEWATER.

02:46:41.057 --> 02:46:44.227
FLOWS AND UPSET THE BALANCE THAT

02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:46.129
WE'VE ACHIEVED IN SAN DIEGO TO

02:46:46.196 --> 02:46:51.868
ENSURE OUR OUR OUR OUR DAMS ARE

02:46:51.935 --> 02:46:53.703
- THE ARE NOT TO THE POINT OF

02:46:53.770 --> 02:46:54.838
DEPLETION LIKE OTHER PARTS OF

02:46:54.904 --> 02:46:57.607
THE STATE- SENEGAL DAMS ARE WRIT

02:46:57.674 --> 02:47:00.877
REGULAR HEALTHY AND WE HAVE

02:47:00.944 --> 02:47:02.278
ESTABLISH CONNECTION POINTS

02:47:02.345 --> 02:47:03.913
BETWEEN A RECYCLING WATER

02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:06.883
RECYCLING PLANTS AND OUR DIESEL

02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:08.051
PLANTS TO THE FOUR POINT THAT

02:47:08.118 --> 02:47:10.120
THE YOUR YOUR BILL WOULD HAVE A

02:47:10.186 --> 02:47:11.721
DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON SAN DIEGO

02:47:11.788 --> 02:47:13.690
AND IMPERIAL COUNTY SO I HAVE TO

02:47:13.757 --> 02:47:16.860
FEEL OBLIGATED TO STAY OFF OF

02:47:16.926 --> 02:47:18.328
YOUR BILL TODAY. AND I

02:47:36.613 --> 02:47:38.114
ASSEMBLY I DID A SERIES OF BILLS

02:47:38.181 --> 02:47:39.983
ON OUTDOOR URBAN LANDSCAPE

02:47:40.049 --> 02:47:41.651
IRRIGATION THAT SET UP THE

02:47:41.718 --> 02:47:44.053
CURRENT SCHEME. AND IT WHAT ONE

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:46.456
WE DID IT WE HAD DOUBLE WORKING

02:47:46.523 --> 02:47:48.324
GROUP IT WAS OVER THREE YEARS WE

02:47:48.391 --> 02:47:50.326
DID A MODEL ORDINANCE WITH WHAT

02:47:50.393 --> 02:47:52.028
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DECIDE TO TAKE

02:47:52.095 --> 02:47:53.363
THEIR OWN ACTION AND IF THEY

02:47:53.430 --> 02:47:55.732
DIDN'T AFTER TWO OR THREE YEARS

02:47:55.799 --> 02:47:56.766
THE MODEL ORDINANCE WAS IMPOSED

02:47:56.833 --> 02:47:58.568
ON THEM. THERE WAS A WAY TO MAKE

02:47:58.635 --> 02:48:00.804
SURE THERE WAS LOCAL CONTROL AND

02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:02.972
A PROCESS WHERE EVERYBODY TALKED

02:48:03.039 --> 02:48:04.574
AND GOT TO THE AGREEMENT THAT

02:48:04.641 --> 02:48:06.743
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN. AND WHAT'S

02:48:06.810 --> 02:48:08.044
HAPPENED HERE IS THE AUTHOR AS

02:48:08.111 --> 02:48:12.415
IDENTIFIED INDOOR WATER USE AND

02:48:12.482 --> 02:48:14.117
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TESTIMONY

02:48:14.184 --> 02:48:15.885
THAT EVERYBODY'S COME OUT OF THE

02:48:15.952 --> 02:48:17.487
WOODWORK WITH WHAT THE ISSUES

02:48:17.554 --> 02:48:19.622
ARE. AND THE THING I APPRECIATED

02:48:19.689 --> 02:48:21.157
IS TO PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE SAID WE

02:48:21.224 --> 02:48:23.393
WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WE WANT

02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:24.294
TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE

02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:25.161
CONVERSATIONS SO WHAT WE'RE

02:48:25.228 --> 02:48:27.530
REALLY DOING. IS THIS ISSUE'S

02:48:27.597 --> 02:48:29.999
BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WERE JUST AT

02:48:30.066 --> 02:48:32.368
THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS AND

02:48:32.435 --> 02:48:34.671
EVEN THE COMMENTS IT JUST MADE

02:48:34.737 --> 02:48:36.806
DONE FIVE PROBLEMS AND SO I WANT

02:48:36.873 --> 02:48:39.275
TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE CHANCE.

02:48:39.342 --> 02:48:40.910
TO MEET HIS GOAL WITH ALL THE

02:48:40.977 --> 02:48:42.445

02:48:44.314 --> 02:48:46.449
PRODUCT THAT THAT DOES THIS

02:48:46.516 --> 02:48:49.219
BECAUSE INDOOR WATER USE IS

02:48:49.285 --> 02:48:50.920
REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND THERE ARE

02:48:50.987 --> 02:48:52.555
STILL MANY PLACES FOR

02:48:52.622 --> 02:48:54.057
CONSERVATION AND WE DO NEED

02:48:54.123 --> 02:48:56.593
CONSERVATION AS A WAY OF LIFE AS

02:48:56.659 --> 02:48:58.027
PART OF OUR ALL OF THE ABOVE

02:48:58.094 --> 02:49:00.096
WATER STRATEGY WITH THAT IN MIND

02:49:00.163 --> 02:49:01.664
I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. OKAY

02:49:01.731 --> 02:49:02.999

YOU JUST REAL QUICK YOU KNOW AS

02:49:07.337 --> 02:49:08.771
AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A

02:49:08.838 --> 02:49:10.540
DISTRICT THAT HAS CONTINUED IN

02:49:10.607 --> 02:49:14.444
STATE IN THE DROUGHT DESPITE.

02:49:14.511 --> 02:49:16.112
SOME OF THE YOU KNOW. THE PEAKS

02:49:16.179 --> 02:49:17.947
- THIS IS. SOMETHING I'M

02:49:18.014 --> 02:49:20.550
WATCHING. BUT ALSO I AGREE THAT.

02:49:20.617 --> 02:49:22.485
I MEAN IF THERE'S NOT A BILL IS

02:49:22.552 --> 02:49:23.386
ON THE CONVERSATION AND SO WE

02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:24.888
HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

02:49:24.954 --> 02:49:26.122
ABOUT THIS- BUT CERTAINLY

02:49:26.189 --> 02:49:28.424
UNDERSTAND THAT. OUR REGIONS ARE

02:49:28.491 --> 02:49:30.760
ALL VERY DIFFERENT ARE ADAPTING-

02:49:30.827 --> 02:49:32.195
IN TRYING TO ADAPT AND MOVE

02:49:32.262 --> 02:49:33.830
FORWARD IN DIFFERENT WAYS

02:49:33.897 --> 02:49:36.399
POSSIBLE- BUT CERTAINLY- YOU

02:49:36.466 --> 02:49:38.234
KNOW NOT ALL DISTRICTS ARE THE

02:49:38.301 --> 02:49:40.336
SAME IN TERMS OF EVEN. ACCESS TO

02:49:40.403 --> 02:49:43.006
WATER AND SO- SO HOPEFULLY THAT

02:49:43.072 --> 02:49:44.507
WILL ALSO BE PART OF THE

02:49:44.574 --> 02:49:45.775
CONVERSATION YOU KNOW HOW THESE

02:49:45.842 --> 02:49:47.911
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES KIND OF WAY

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:49.412

OUR LOCAL WATER AGENCIES ARE

02:50:35.291 --> 02:50:36.593
ACTUALLY- STILL HOLDING OUT ON

A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SIR IF YOU

DON'T MIND FIRST AND- OBVIOUSLY

02:50:55.011 --> 02:50:56.579
THE REDUCTION FROM FIFTY TWO

02:50:56.646 --> 02:50:57.981

BEGINNING IN TWENTY THIRTY- I

02:51:01.951 --> 02:51:03.586
THINK IS DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS.

02:51:03.653 --> 02:51:05.455
ESPECIALLY FOR IN HOUSE WATER

02:51:05.521 --> 02:51:07.857

A COMMENT THAT SAID THAT PEOPLE

WERE OVER EXAGGERATING AND THAT

03:12:11.019 --> 03:12:12.921
LOT ABOUT WHO WE ARE. RESULT

03:12:12.988 --> 03:12:15.023
DECISIONS FOR ALL DECISIONS HAVE

03:12:15.090 --> 03:12:16.825
LOCAL IMPLICATIONS AND THAT IS

03:12:16.892 --> 03:12:19.060
TRUE ABOUT THE OIL INDUSTRY. SO

03:12:19.127 --> 03:12:20.929
SHE'S ALREADY TALKED ABOUT HUMAN

03:12:20.996 --> 03:12:22.964
IMPACTS OVERSEAS AND WHAT WE'RE

03:12:23.031 --> 03:12:24.766
DOING SO IT'S TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY

03:12:24.833 --> 03:12:26.968
WHAT ARE POLICIES DO HERE IN

03:12:27.035 --> 03:12:29.337
CALIFORNIA. BY INCREASING THE

03:12:29.404 --> 03:12:31.506
COST OF ALL FORMS OF ENERGY. AS

03:12:31.573 --> 03:12:33.875
A MATTER OF EXAMPLE. INSTEAD OF

03:12:33.942 --> 03:12:35.243
CALIFORNIA YOU LIVE HERE YOU PAY

03:12:35.310 --> 03:12:37.112
A DOLLAR A DOLLAR FIFTY MORE PER

03:12:37.178 --> 03:12:38.280
GALLON FOR EVERY GALLON OF GAS

03:12:38.346 --> 03:12:39.881
AND DIESEL COMPARED TO EVERY

03:12:39.948 --> 03:12:41.650
STATE THAT BORDERS THE STATE OF

03:12:41.716 --> 03:12:42.417
CALIFORNIA. IF YOU LIVE IN

03:12:42.484 --> 03:12:44.352
CALIFORNIA YOU PAY BETWEEN THREE

03:12:44.419 --> 03:12:46.388
AND FOUR TIMES AS MUCH. FOR

03:12:46.454 --> 03:12:48.890
EVERY KILOWATT HOUR OF ENERGY AS

03:12:48.957 --> 03:12:51.660
YOU DO IF YOU LIVE IN ANY STATE

03:12:51.726 --> 03:12:52.661
BORDERING. THE STATE OF

03:12:52.727 --> 03:12:54.029
CALIFORNIA. THIRTY CALIFORNIA'S

03:12:54.095 --> 03:12:55.130
THIRTY NINE MILLION PEOPLE OF

03:12:55.196 --> 03:12:56.932
THOSE THIRTY NINE MILLION PEOPLE

03:12:56.998 --> 03:12:59.067
ABOUT 36% LIVE NEAR OR BELOW THE

03:12:59.134 --> 03:13:00.902
POVERTY LEVEL THEY ARE HANGING

03:13:00.969 --> 03:13:02.971
ON. BY THEIR FINGERNAILS. THE

03:13:03.038 --> 03:13:05.106
UNNECESSARY INCREASED COST OF

03:13:05.173 --> 03:13:07.609
THOSE CRITICAL FORMS OF ENERGY.

03:13:07.676 --> 03:13:08.777
ARE GOING TO DRIVE THEM BELOW

03:13:08.843 --> 03:13:11.346
THE POVERTY LEVEL 36% THAT'S

03:13:11.413 --> 03:13:13.415
FOURTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS.

03:13:13.481 --> 03:13:15.517
RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE GONNA BE

03:13:15.583 --> 03:13:17.452
OKAY WITH 40% OR FORTY TWO OR

03:13:17.519 --> 03:13:19.387
FORTY FOUR PERCENT. WE DON'T

03:13:19.454 --> 03:13:21.456
NEED THAT THAT IS NOT NECESSARY.

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:23.124
AND AS FAR AS THE JUST

03:13:23.191 --> 03:13:25.660
TRANSITION I DON'T BELIEVE ANY

03:13:25.727 --> 03:13:26.828
OF THOSE FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE

03:13:26.895 --> 03:13:28.897
WOULD THINK DRIVING THEM DEEPER

03:13:28.964 --> 03:13:30.432
INTO POVERTY. IS VERY JUST THAT

03:13:30.498 --> 03:13:32.233
ALL. MISSTATED CALIFORNIA WE

03:13:32.300 --> 03:13:33.668
HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF ENERGY AND

03:13:33.735 --> 03:13:36.071
WE HAVE THE TALENT. THE THOUSAND

03:13:36.137 --> 03:13:37.672

03:13:37.739 --> 03:13:39.808

03:13:39.874 --> 03:13:41.943
THEM ARE FOR INFIELD DRILLING

03:13:42.010 --> 03:13:44.012
THAT MEANS GOING IN AND DRILLING

03:13:44.079 --> 03:13:45.080
ADDITIONAL WELLS. LIKE IN THAT

03:13:45.146 --> 03:13:46.381

WELLS ON EXISTING OIL FIELDS IN

03:13:50.952 --> 03:13:53.121
KNOWN RESERVOIRS. THAT WOULD BE

03:13:53.188 --> 03:13:55.290
DRILLED USING- PERFECTED

03:13:55.357 --> 03:13:58.026

03:13:58.093 --> 03:13:59.627
AS WELL AS THE OIL COMING OUT

03:13:59.694 --> 03:14:00.996
THERE WILL GOING IN EXISTING

03:14:01.062 --> 03:14:03.298
INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE ITS WAY

03:14:03.365 --> 03:14:05.100
TO MARKET IT IS THE LEAST

03:14:05.166 --> 03:14:07.902
EXPENSIVE. SAFEST MOST THE LEAST

03:14:07.969 --> 03:14:09.304
INTRUSIVE METHOD TO GET

03:14:09.371 --> 03:14:11.606
ADDITIONAL BARRELS OF OIL TO

03:14:11.673 --> 03:14:13.775

PHRASE GLOBALLY AND THAT IS

03:14:17.278 --> 03:14:19.347
ENERGY POVERTY ENERGY POVERTY

03:14:19.414 --> 03:14:20.815
MEANS THE ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR

03:14:20.882 --> 03:14:22.484
CRITICAL FORMS OF ENERGY. IT'S

03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:23.952
GOING TO HAPPEN IT DOESN'T HAVE

RECORD YOU KNOW ONE THING ABOUT

THIS IS THAT THERE IS A CALL

03:28:04.138 --> 03:28:05.706
COMMENT MADE ABOUT OUR

03:28:05.773 --> 03:28:07.141
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

AND THAT THEY'RE NOT IN KERN AND

03:28:09.109 --> 03:28:10.344
I JUST WANTED TO GO ON RECORD

03:28:10.411 --> 03:28:12.413
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A LOT OF

03:28:12.479 --> 03:28:14.381
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND THEY NO

03:28:14.448 --> 03:28:15.749
LONGER OWN THEIR LAND- AND SO-

03:28:15.816 --> 03:28:17.818
WHAT WE ARE SEEN IN ONE COUNTRY-

03:28:17.885 --> 03:28:19.787
IS DIFFERENT TO- HERE BUT BUT

03:28:19.854 --> 03:28:21.155
THE FACT THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE

03:28:21.222 --> 03:28:23.324
AT ONE. POINT THEIR LAND WAS

03:28:23.390 --> 03:28:25.326
ALSO A DECIMATED I THINK JUST

03:28:25.392 --> 03:28:27.127
NEEDS TO GO ON RECORD- BECAUSE I

03:28:27.194 --> 03:28:28.629

03:28:28.696 --> 03:28:30.030
TO ME TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND I

03:28:30.097 --> 03:28:31.899
THINK ALL YOUR VISUALS ARE VERY

03:28:31.966 --> 03:28:34.001
KEY IN- HIGHLIGHTING WHAT CAN

03:28:34.068 --> 03:28:36.036
HAPPEN ANYWHERE AT ANY PART OF

03:28:36.103 --> 03:28:37.805
THE GLOBE WHEN THIS BILL LOOKS

03:28:37.872 --> 03:28:39.540
LIKE THAT IT WILL STILL BE

03:28:39.607 --> 03:28:40.941
PROBLEMATIC IN KERN COUNTY IN

03:28:41.008 --> 03:28:44.278
ANY OTHER COUNTY OR IN ANY OTHER

03:28:44.345 --> 03:28:46.881

THERE WAS NO OFFENSE MEANT TO

03:28:58.025 --> 03:28:59.994
INDIGENOUS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD

03:29:00.060 --> 03:29:01.862
