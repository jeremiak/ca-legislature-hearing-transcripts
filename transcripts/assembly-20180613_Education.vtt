00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:55.807
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION TO SEE IF

00:27:55.874 --> 00:27:57.208
IT'S AN APPROPRIATE ACTION FOR

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:58.543
THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:59.511
IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT.

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:03.114
THIS MEDICATION FOR LACK OF A

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.182
DIFFERENT WORD --

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:06.351
DOES HELP TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF

00:28:06.418 --> 00:28:07.786
CHILDREN WITH THE APPROPRIATE

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:09.454
EDUCATION WITHOUT FEELING AS IF

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.022
THEY'RE ON OPIOIDS AND OUT OF

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:12.323
TOUCH WITH SOCIETY.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.825
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS DOES BECOME

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:15.193
A LOCAL ISSUE AND WE WOULD ASK

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.162

GOD FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:59.771
I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:02.207
TODAY I I I JUST HAD A QUESTION.

00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:05.276
ARM FOR CONTACTS AND HOW OFTEN

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:06.244
ARE THESE CONVERSATIONS NOW

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:08.012
TAKING PLACE.

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:09.080
IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HOW MANY

00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:10.582
STUDENTS FIND THEMSELVES WITH

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:13.651
THE NEED TO HAVE ACCESS --

00:29:13.718 --> 00:29:16.488
TO MEDICATION JUST BECAUSE IT.

00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:17.555
WHEN THE BILL CAME TO ME I

00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:19.791
HADN'T BEEN AWARE THAT WE WERE

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:22.160
FORCING STUDENTS --

00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:23.294
ACCESS MEDICATION OUTSIDE OF

00:29:23.361 --> 00:29:24.362
SCHOOL OR MAYBE IN WAYS THAT

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:25.797
WOULD MAKE THEM UNSAFE.

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:27.298
AND I ONE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF

00:29:27.365 --> 00:29:29.167
HOW SCHOOLS NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:30.502
SUPPORT --

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:32.370
OUR STUDENTS IN HOW COMMON ARE

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.506
THESE NEEDS IF YOU HAVE ANY.

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:35.673
SENSE OF THAT OR ANY OF THE

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.375
WITNESSES HAVE ANY SENSE OF THAT.

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.611
ON HOW OFFICE COMES UP.

00:29:39.677 --> 00:29:40.478
ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN I I DON'T

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:42.714
HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF MORE THAN JUST

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.249
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:46.084
BUT I BELIEVE OBVIOUSLY IF WITH

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:47.051
THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.953
EMBRACED THIS AND I THINK IN

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.389
OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:52.357
UP AROUND THE IMPACT TO DISTRICT

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.458
THAT I REPRESENT THERE ARE

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:54.726
OTHERS BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANY

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:58.930
SPECIFIC CASES.

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:00.532
BUT BEING OUR CATS --

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:02.534
CIRCLE THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.269
CHILDREN THAT HAVE NEEDS THAT

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:05.670
NEED TO TAKE MEDICATION AT

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:06.504
SCHOOL WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:07.172
NOW.

00:30:07.238 --> 00:30:09.207
IS MOST PARENTS ARE TRYING TO

00:30:09.274 --> 00:30:10.909
SCHEDULE IT AROUND SCHOOL BUT

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:11.976
IT'S NOT WORKING THEY'RE NOT

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:13.378
ACHIEVING THE CONTROL THAT THEY

00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:14.179
NEED.

00:30:14.245 --> 00:30:15.213
BECAUSE ARE WITHHOLDING

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.715
MEDICATION TIMES.

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:19.951
SO THERE IS A GREATER NEED AND

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:21.886
IF THEY'RE SAFE ACCESS I BELIEVE

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:24.022
MORE PARENTS AND FAMILIES WILL

00:30:24.088 --> 00:30:26.591
BE MORE WILLING TO COME FORWARD.

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:27.559
IMAGINE IF THIS IS GOING TO

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:29.027
REQUIRE A LOT A TRADING IN

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:31.029
SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:32.430
MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER POLICIES

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:33.398
GET CREATED.

00:30:33.464 --> 00:30:35.366
ARE CONSISTENT DISTRICT TO

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:37.168
DISTRICT TO NOT A LOT OF OF

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:38.503
FOLKS CSPA HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:39.938
HOW TO DO THAT I MEAN I KNOW FOR

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:41.272
EXAMPLE I WE HAVE EXAMPLE DOCTOR

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:43.241
WEBER HAS INTRODUCED A BILL --

00:30:43.308 --> 00:30:45.076
THAT HELPS OUR STUDENTS TO BE

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:46.978
SAFE -- AND

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.880
MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES IN SCHOOL

00:30:48.947 --> 00:30:50.715
AND THEIR OTHER SIMILAR BILLS

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:51.883
WHERE THERE'S A STATE MANDATE

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.551
BUT HOW IT GETS RULED OUT AT THE

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:55.186
DISTRICT LEVEL SOME DISTRICTS DO

00:30:55.253 --> 00:30:56.621
WELL AND OTHERS.

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.523
NOT SO WELL AND SO I'M

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.159
INTERESTED WORK --

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:03.661
TO IMPLEMENT THIS INSTANTLY EVEN

00:31:03.728 --> 00:31:04.262
IF IT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:06.731
AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEE --

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:08.132
STARTED THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.101
WITHIN OUR OWN ORGANIZATION OF

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:11.336
WHAT THIS POTENTIALLY LOOKS LIKE

00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:12.937
WITH LEGAL COUNSEL WITH OTHERS --

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:14.939
WE WILL IF THIS DOES BECOME LAW

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:16.341
WE WILL PUT TOGETHER A SET OF

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.042
DRAFT POLICIES WHICH IS THEN

00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:19.344
SENT OUT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.979
IN THIS WITHIN THE STATE.

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:22.880
MOST DISTRICTS MIGHT MAKE A WORD

00:31:22.947 --> 00:31:24.482
CHANGER TO BUT FOR THE MOST PART

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:26.284
A LOT OF THEM TO ADOPT WITH THE

00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:27.285
DRAFT POLICY IS.

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:28.586
SO THERE WOULD HOPEFULLY PROVIDE

00:31:28.653 --> 00:31:30.622
SOME CONSISTENCY I WILL ALSO

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:32.624
RELATE THIS CONVERSATION BACK TO

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.058
OUR POLICY DEVELOPMENT STAFF.

00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:35.560
SAID THERE WHERE OF TRYING TO

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.161
MAKE SURE THAT WE USE.

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:38.630
IF KNOW THAT'S COMMON LANGUAGE

00:31:38.696 --> 00:31:40.098
THAT EVERYBODY CAN UNDERSTAND.

00:31:40.164 --> 00:31:41.966
AND THAT IT GETS TO THE ISSUE OF

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:44.469
MAKING SURE THE KIDS ARE SAFE --

00:31:44.535 --> 00:31:46.704
AND THAT PARENTS HAVE ACCESS BUT

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:48.439
THAT THE SCHOOL SITE IS ALSO.

00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:49.841
SO THANK YOU THANK YOU IF I

00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:51.376
COULD POINT OUT MISTER CHAIR IS

00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:54.412
THAT THIS IS NOT A MANDATE SO

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:56.447
THIS THE GRAPHICS THAT SHOW SO

00:31:56.514 --> 00:31:58.449
CHOOSE YOUR DESIRE TO DO IT CAN

00:31:58.516 --> 00:31:59.350
DO IT IN THOSE.

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.085
MAY FIND IT AWKWARD OR

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:02.954
UNCOMFORTABLE ONE LEFT RIGHT AND

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:03.855
AND ALSO TO MISTER TERENCE

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:04.856
QUESTION ABOUT YOU HOW AND HOW

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:06.991
OFTEN AS IS HAPPENING --

00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:08.626
I JUST MAKE TWO POINTS OF MY

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:09.927

AND IN OUR STATE POSSIBLE IN

00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:13.865
FORWARD I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:14.499
DRUG THAT'S COMING OUT IN THE

00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:15.600
OVER THE NEXT YEAR THAT SPEAKS

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.001
TO MAYBE EVEN THIS EXACT

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:18.102
SITUATION.

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.637
THAT'S CANNABINOID BASED AS I

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:21.873
UNDERSTAND IT SO IT'S IT'S GOING

00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:24.075
BACK BUT IT'S ALSO GOING FORWARD.

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.043
WHEN THINGS HAVE MEDICINAL VALUE

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:26.878
