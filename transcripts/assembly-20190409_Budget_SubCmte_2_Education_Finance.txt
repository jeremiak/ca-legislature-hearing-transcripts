SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER TWO ON EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY WE HAVE SOME MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND WE WILL START WITH ISSUE THE FIRST ISSUE WITH -- DEPARTMENT OF ED. AND WHO'S FROM. YES THIS THE THE ISSUE IS ADULT EDUCATION SO WE HAVE COMING UP DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TERMINA FINANCE ADELIA PLEASE COME UP. IT'S GOING TO GO FIRST. OKAY FIRST [inaudible] YES. AND WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE LA OUT. THANK YOU THE SICKENING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE MUST FIND OVERVIEW OF ADULT EDUCATION IS CONTEXT FOR THIS ISSUE. THE SERGEANTS ARE DISTRIBUTING HAND OUT THAT WILL BE SPEAKING FROM. WHAT DO YOU SEE THE HAND OUT YOU'LL SEE ON THE FIRST PAGE THAT THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF ADULT EDUCATION IS TO PROVIDE ADULTS WITH PRE COLLEGIATE KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND ABILITIES? AND TO THAT END THE MAIN INSTRUCTIONAL AREAS AND IT'LL THAT CONSIST OF BASIC ENGLISH MATH. ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AND ALSO SHORT TERM C. D. E.. IN CALIFORNIA THE MAIN PROVIDERS OF ADULT EDUCATION OUR ADULT SCHOOLS OPERATED BY K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SYSTEM. HISTORICALLY THESE TWO SYSTEMS OF OPERATED SEPARATELY BUT BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS ABOUT LACK OF COORDINATION ACROSS THE DIFFERENT PROVIDER TYPES. THE STATE RESTRUCTURED ADULT ADD AROUND A SYSTEM REGIONAL CONSORTIA. THE COMBINED BOTH ADULTS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. CURRENTLY THERE SEVENTY ONE OF THESE REGIONAL ADULT EDUCATION CONSORTIA ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE ROUGHLY NOT TO THAT SEVENTY TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. THE STATE IS PROVIDING A ONGOING FUNDING. OFFICIALLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION STARTING IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FOR INSTRUCTION AT THE ADULT SCHOOLS AND NON CONSTRUCTION THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT SOME ADULT EDUCATION FIGHTERS DO ALSO RECEIVE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEY RECEIVE APPORTIONMENT FOR THEIR NON CREDIT ADULT COURSES. AND BOTH ADULTS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES SOMETIMES RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING. YOU'LL RECALL THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE STATE DID AUGMENT FUNDING FOR THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE ADULT EDUCATION BLOCK GRANT. THE BULK OF THIS AUGMENTATION TWENTY TWO MILLION WAS FOR A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE REMAINING FIVE MILLION ONGOING AUGMENTATION WAS FOR DATA IMPROVEMENTS. COMBINED WITH AN ADDITIONAL DATA REQUIREMENTS THESE WERE INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE TRACKING OF STUDENT OUTCOMES ACROSS PROVIDER TYPES AND ASTON CENTER THE WORK FORCE. THIS YEAR IS YOUR CAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. WHAT YOU BRING TOTAL FUNDING FOR THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION ON GOING? INCLUDE -- OVERVIEW WE WANTED NOTED A FEW UNRESOLVED ISSUES IN THE STATE'S ADULT EDUCATION SYSTEM. AS WE HAVE NOTED BEFORE WHEN THE STATE RESTRUCTURED AT ALL ADD IT WAS WITH THE GOAL OF BRINGING TOGETHER TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS. AND WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY EFFORTS TO BETTER LINE IS TO SYSTEMS THERE ARE A FEW OF REMAINING UNRESOLVED ISSUES. ONE OF THESE ISSUES HAS TO DO WITH FUNDING BECAUSE THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE A PER STUDENT FUNDING RATE. THAT'S DESIGNATED ACROSS PROVIDER TYPES THERE IS LIKELY VARIATION IN FUNDING LEVELS PURPOSE ACROSS PROVIDERS. WHICH MAY RESULT IN DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS AND QUALITY ACROSS THE STATE. THERE ALSO SOME POLICIES THAT ARE DIFFERENT BETWEEN THAT ALL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY POLICIES RELATED TO COURSE FEES AN INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS. AND FINALLY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME OUTSTANDING CONCERNS WITH THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE AND STUDENT OUTCOMES. SINCE RESTRUCTURING IT ALL AT SYSTEM THERE HAS NOT BEEN CONFERENCE A DATE ON THIS WHICH HAS MADE IT CHALLENGING. TO EVALUATE WHETHER IT'S SPENDING ON THE PROGRAM HAS ACHIEVED ITS DESIRED RESULTS. THAT BEING SAID I HAD THE DEPARTMENTS OF INDICATED TO US THAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE UNDERWAY AND I BELIEVE WILL BE CARRYING FROM THEM LATER ON THIS PANEL. ON THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE. THANK A CRUISER OVERVIEW AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU KEITH IS ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES OVER SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUNDING FOR THREE PRIMARY ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS. FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION OF WHICH IS FROM PROPOSITION I GENERAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND -- FOR THEBUT THE MAIN ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM JOINTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMITTEE CALL CHANCES OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- THERE'S FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE ADULT IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND A HUNDRED APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FOUR MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TITLE TO WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES ACT AND CAL WORKS AT ALL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS A PORTION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND K. TWELVE PORTION IS THAT ALSO SERVE -- THE ADULT EDUCATION A STUDENT DEMOGRAPHIC -- OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS NOTED ABOVE EIGHTEEN MILLION -- IS THE COLOR FOR THE DAHLE EDUCATION PROGRAM AND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS A COLA FOR THE ADULTS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES PROGRAM THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK. YES SO I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT OUT THAT -- THAT WE ACTUALLY OUR WONDERFUL BECAUSE MY COMMENTS ON THE ISSUE OF THE THE DATA. AND THE PERFORMANCE WE'VE ACTUALLY OR SEEN INCREASES AND PERFORMANCE. OUR WE'RE TRACKING PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE PROGRAM AREAS AND WERE SEEN INCREASES WE ALWAYS SEE AN INCREASE OF 10%. OVER THE LAST YEAR AND MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THE PAST WE ARE. INCREASING OUR ACTUALLY A IMPROVING UPON A DAY REPORTING YOU'LL FIND WHEN YOU SEE THE ACTUAL AND A REPORT FOR THIS YEAR. THAT WE DID NOT HAVE IN THE PRIOR YEAR'S OUTCOME SUCH AS TRANSITIONS INTO POST SECONDARY OR DID WE DO WE CAN HAVE THE WORK FORCE OUTCOMES SUCH AS MEDIAN WAGE AND WAGE GAINS -- SO NOW YOU'LL SEE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE DATED REPORT OUT THOUGH SO WE ARE IMPROVING UPON THOSE AREAS -- YES OF FOR EXAMPLE WE ACTUALLY HAD. US THE LIKELY. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE THE COUNT OF STUDENTS WITH SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND WE ACTUALLY INCREASE AT THE SEVEN EIGHT SIXTY THREE THOUSAND WHICH WAS. A 10% INCREASE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE OUTCOMES. AND ALL THE OPERABLE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AREAS -- GOOD MORNING. BUDGET CHAIR MCCARTY IN MEMBERS I AM DOCTOR CAROLINE'S ACT READ MINISTRY -- OF THE ADULT EDUCATION OFFICE TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND. THIS WEEK HAPPENS TO BE ADULT EDUCATION WEEK SO AS A HEARING ON THIS TOPIC IT'S VERY TIMELY. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE PACKED AUDIENCE IN THE BACK MANY OF OUR ADULT ED FOLKS ARE HERE TODAY. MISSION OF THE ADULT EDUCATION OFFICES TO DELIVER ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE TO PROVIDERS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADULT EDUCATION. AS IT SERVES CALIFORNIANS. ADULT EDUCATION OFFICE MONITORS AND OVERSEES THE TITLE TO ADULT EDUCATION FAMILY LITERACY ACT WHICH IS PART OF THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT. CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES. THE TITLE TO DOLLARS PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS IN ADDITION THE ADULT EDUCATION OFFICE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CALIFORNIA. COLLEGE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCES OFFICE JOINTLY ADMINISTER AS WAS SHARE EARLIER THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM PROVIDING ADULT EDUCATION SERVICES TO REGIONAL CONSORTIA THROUGHOUT. THE STATE WE RECENTLY SENT OVER A DRAFT OF THE ANNUAL END OF THE YEAR REPORT. REPORTED DRESSES SOME KEY PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS STATE LEVEL DATA ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT OUTCOMES SKILL GAINES STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND OTHER DATA USING THE ADULT EDUCATION DATA AND ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS. AND ARE AS WELL AS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ON THE REPORT. THAT'S NOT GOING. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT OUT OF ORDER TODAY. I KNOW THERE IS THAT ADULT EDUCATION CONTINGENT HERE AND THEY ASKED. THEY SAID LOOK WE'RE GONNA WE COULD SPEAK FOR THIRTY MINUTES AT THE END. THIRTY PEOPLE AT ONE MINUTE OR WE CAN DO A THREE MINUTE PRESENTATION SO I THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR TRADE. SO SO SO WITH THAT -- GOING TO BRING AT DON KEPT KEY WITH THE ASSOCIATION TO GIVE US A PRESENTATION ON ADULT EDUCATION. AND THEN OF ALL WILL HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND SOME QUESTIONS AFTER YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON KHAKI MCCUE CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ADULT EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA DON'T EDUCATION ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION. APPRECIATES OUR THE OPPORTUNITY -- ADULT EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- SYSTEM FOR I SERVING SOME OF THE MOST MARGINALIZED AMONG OUR COMMUNITIES I AS WAS MENTIONED WE DO PROGRAMMING IN ESL CITIZENSHIP BASIC SKILLS ARE CAREER TRAINING -- AND MUCH MORE FAMILY LITERACY AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THAT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS AND STUDENTS WE SERVE I FIT TO DIRECTLY INTO THE PRIORITIES YOU HAVE A LEAD AS THE LEGISLATURE. HI I HAVE IDENTIFIED A WHETHER THAT'S IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN THE SUPPORT THAT WE PROVIDE TO THOSE PARENTS -- IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION -- AS WELL CITIZENSHIP ESL OF FOR OUR STUDENTS LOOKING FOR THE PATH TO CITIZENSHIP I AND BASIC SKILLS AND SUPPORT FOR SHORT TERM CAREER TRAINING I'VE FOR THOSE. LOOKING TO ADD TO RETOOL AND ME ON THE FIND A NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN CAREER OR FOR TRANSITIONS -- TO WORK WITH THEM ON BASIC SKILLS TO TRANSITION THEM TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGEPARTNERS -- AND HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE ADDITION AND INCLUSION OF A COAL -- BY THE ADMINISTRATION A VERY POSITIVE -- WE DO NOTE UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER THAT WHILE POSITIVE THE ODD THAT CHOCOLATE IS NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE INCREASING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SALARY PENSION COSTS WHAT HAVE YOU. I'LL BULLARD ABOUT THREE POINT TOLL SCHOOL STRUGGLE WITH COST INCREASES EACH YEAR BETWEEN FIVE AND 9% BASED ON -- KIND OF VARYING FACTORS EACH DISTRICT IS AS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT THE POINT BEING THE COAL IS NOT COVERING THOSE COST INCREASES. AS WAS MENTIONED -- ALTHOUGH SOME OF OUR ADULT SCHOOLS DO YOU RECEIVE SOME FEDERAL FUNDING -- MOST OF THEM ARE RELYING SOLELY ON THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM DOLLARS WHICH MEANS WITH RISING COSTS AND BAO COLA THAT DOESN'T COVER THOSE RISING COSTS. THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN CHALLENGING POSITIONS TO HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS AROUND PROGRAMMING -- AND CUTS TO PROGRAMMING TO BACK FILL THOSE RISING COSTS SO THE RESULT IS IS THAT FEWER OPTIONS ARE GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF SERVING. THE STUDENTS THAT ARE THE MOST MORE MARGINALIZED -- WHO NEED THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES I TO KIND OF LIFT THEMSELVES UP SUPPORT THEIR K. TWELVE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD LEARNER WHAT HAVE YOU SO WITH THAT WE HAVE PUTS I RESPECTFULLY ON THE TABLE? A PROPOSAL FOR A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FOR% THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM. THE THOUGHT THERE IS THAT WE WOULD BE USING THIRTY MILLION OF THAT I TO FOCUS ON HARD TO SERVE POPULATIONS WITH SOME PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING. WE REPRESENT THE Q. TWELVE ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS AND WE'RE COMMITTED. TO DELIVERING ON OUTCOMES AND BELIEVE THAT THE DATA WILL SHOW THAT COMMITMENT IN WORKING WITH -- THE CHAIR A LAST YEAR ON IMPLEMENTING IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION METRICS TO DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO DELIVERING OUTCOMES AND PROVIDING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE RESOURCES. THAT THIRTY MILLION WOULD BE ANTI TO SOME PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING IN THAT REGARD. AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION OF THAT HUNDRED TEN WOULD GO TOWARDS I'VE BEEN HELPING TO ADDRESS ICTP FEES ARE TO MINIMIZE SOME OF THERE'D BURDENS ON OUR STUDENTS RELATIVE TO FEES THAT WE HAVE NO WHERE ELSE TO PULL FUNDING TO BACK FILL. AND PROVIDE SOME GROWTH AND THEN FINALLY A FIFTY MILLION OF THAT HUNDRED TEND TO GO TOWARDS RISING COSTS AS WELL AS ON GROWING ACCESS FOR THE STUDENTS THAT NEED AT CENSUS DATA. SHOWS THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF US ADULTS WHO NEED BASIC SKILLS ESL WHAT HAVE YOU AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS A DEFENSIBLE NUMBER -- WE'VE REALLY TRIED TO COME TO YOU WITH A SUCH AND RELIGIOUS WOULD ENCOURAGE BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THE BROADER LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- ABSENT TWO DOTS ARE WE DO WANT TO ON GOING CUTS TO PROGRAMMING BOTH IT IS SEEN THEM ALREADY IN CURRENT BUDGET YEAR -- BUT ALSO WHEN OUT HERE SO WITH THAT SAID I REALLY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEYOND THE COLA. ON AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SURE ALSO QUESTIONS FOR DEPARTMENT A MAYBE JUST ONE FOR THE THE ASSOCIATION HERE SO AS PART OF YOUR REQUEST UNDERSTAND IT'S THREE FOLD. IT'S YOUR YOUR COSTS WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES AND SO FORTH IN RETIREMENT -- ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND THEN THIS THAT TARGETED PERFORMANCE BONUS SYSTEM SO ONE OF THAT THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AS HIS -- HIS ACCESS AND DURING THAT GREAT RECESSION. TREMENDOUS A LOSS OF ACCESS AND SOME OF THESE. COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA I THINK THE BIGGEST SHOCKING ONE WAS THE NUMBERS FROM LOS ANGELES I FORGET THAT THE ACTUAL DETAILS OF THAT -- AS FAR AS THE THAT THE NUMBER BUT AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR REPORT I'M ASKING SECOND FROM THE DEPARTMENT BUT WHAT DO YOU FROM YOUR MEMBERS -- TAG AS THE UNMET NEED OUT THERE AS FAR AS ACCESS ENROLLMENT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- EACH OF THE REGIONS GO THROUGH A PLANNING PROCESS -- WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS THE ADULT SCHOOLS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHAT HAVE YOU TO IDENTIFY THE UNMET NEED IN EACH REGION OBVIOUSLY THAT VARIES FROM REGION TO REGION. I KNOW CENSUS DATA PRIOR TO CATEGORICAL FLEXIBILITY -- WHEN WE WERE FUNDED JUST AS A KEY TWELVE SYSTEM AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ALONE INDICATED THERE WAS FIRE THERE WERE FIVE MILLION ADULTS IN NEED OF BASIC SKILLS ON ESL? WHAT HAVE YOU AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT NUMBER IS TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TODAY I THINK THE DEPARTMENTS AND PERHAPS OTHER CHANCES OFFICE COULD SPEAK TO KIND OF? MORE UPDATED NUMBERS -- BUT THEY DID UNMET NEED A SIGNIFICANT STILL IN THE STATE. PARTICULARLY -- WERE LOOKING OUT KIND OF THE NEEDS OF OUR KIND OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION WE ARE SEEN. HOMELESS ADULTS ARE GROWING AND MANY OF OUR TOLL SCHOOLS ARE SERVING -- HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAREER ADVANCEMENT CAREER TRAINING WHICH IS VERY POSITIVE ADDITIONALLY ARE GIVEN FEDERAL POLICIES AROUND IMMIGRATION ARE PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE CITIZENSHIP PATHWAYS YOURSELF FOR THOSE IN NEED OF THAT -- SO IN TERMS OF THE NEED TO AYE IT'S DEFINITELY SIGNIFICANT I BELIEVE IN AND AROUND KIND OF THE FIVE MILLION MARK. THANK YOU FOR THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BABY DEPARTMENT AT THAT AT FIRST THERE IS THAT REPORT COMING. SHORTLY AS FAR AS THAT THE THE YOU'RE IN A REPORT. CORRECT GAS INDIAN AND NEED SO THAT. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING DIFFERENT IN PRIOR YEARS AS FAR AS MONEY TO HAVE IN THE BUDGET AND ACCESS ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE. SO RIGHT NOW THE REPORT IS IN DRAFT FORM IT'S THE JOINTLY JOINTLY -- PUT TOGETHER BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE DID SEND OVER A DRAFT PART OF THAT. WHAT THE REPORT WILL SHOW -- WON'T HAVE SPECIFIC DATA ON THE NEED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OUR CONSORTIA WORKING ON THEIR THREE YEAR PLANS AND PART OF THAT. THREE YEAR PLANNING PROCESS IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING OUT WHAT THEIR CURRENT NEED IS WITHIN THEIR REGION WILL BE ABLE TO PULL THAT DATA OUT FROM THEIR THREE YEAR PLANS WHICH ARE DUE. IN AT THE BEGINNING OF JUNE OKAY. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHAT'S THE QUESTION ABOUT THAT THE CAPACITY IN THE NEED I MEAN OUT I KNOW WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET AND THAT'S FRANKLY WHAT YOU HAD PROP NINETY EIGHT BUT BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS -- UNMET NEED OUT THERE FOR ADULT EDUCATION OF OUR THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE. TO TACKLE WITH OUR WITH OUR BUDGET APPROPRIATION. I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE BY THE REASON THERE'S THERE'S SEVERAL REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN REQUIRED YOU HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED FRONT JOINTLY FROM DEPARTMENT OCCASION IN THE CHANCES OFFICE FIRST TO ASSESS. YOU KNOW THOSE TYPES OF METRICS IN TERMS OF NEED DEMAND -- OUTCOMES -- SO WE ARE ALSO GOING TO AWAITING THAT DATA INTO AND WE'LL TAKE THAT DATA INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE DEVELOP THE YOU KNOW THE MAY REVISION -- WILL BE DEFINITELY -- ARE OPEN TO CONSIDERING ALL ALL INFORMATION TERMS OF DEMAND IN THE OKAY THANK YOU AND AND JUST -- YOU KNOW I I THINK THIS COMMITTEE AND I SUPPORTED. ADULT EDUCATION -- INVESTMENT THE LAST FEW YEARS AND YOU KNOW THIS HAS A COLON THERE WHICH IS A GOOD THING AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE LOWER OUR OVERALL ACCESS -- YOU KNOW ADULT EDUCATION SERVES SO MANY CAPACITIES FOR YOU KNOW PEOPLE FOCUSING ON BASIC SKILLS -- IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION AS WE HEARD -- NOW ENGLISH LANGUAGE -- CERTAINLY CREDIT RECOVERY AND YOU KNOW US. I'LL SAY IT AGAIN I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF ADULT EDUCATION SOME PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED. YES AND BY THE WAY HAPPY ADULT EDUCATION WEEK SO I AM CERTAINLY NOT PROUD THAT IN MY FINAL YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL AT A POINT. EIGHT GPA THAT'S NOT A MISTAKE POINT EIGHT ZERO AND IT LANDED ME IN WINTER STEEN ADULT SCHOOL. ABOUT FIVE MILES DOWN THE ROAD AND ARMED FOR MALL BUT BECAUSE OF THAT HELP ME GET MY ACT TOGETHER AND AND HELP ME TO ENROLL YOUR SO LATER IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I WENT DOWN LATER TO LONG BEACH STATE TWENTY MISTER DONILON BACK HERE TODAY SO ADULT EDUCATION SERVICE. ALL KINDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE BUT I I KNOW FIRST HAND THE VALUE. OF ADULT DAD SO WE'LL BE LOOKING -- TO TO TO REINVEST AND MAKE SURE WE SERVE. CALIFORNIANS WHO WHO NEED THAT TAXES SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WITH THE MERRY VISE AND AS WELL AS WHAT -- WE HAVE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET AS WELL SO WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE PROCEED ISSUE NUMBER TWO OKAY ONCE AGAIN WILL HAVE LA US START LA UP. IN JAIL. THE SERGEANTS DISTRIBUTED SECONDHAND OUT THAT WILL BE SEEKING FROM FOR THIS ISSUE THIS PROVIDES SAID BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CALVIN CAN COLLEGES STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. HE NEVER CALLED STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM GRANT OF THAT. TASK FORCE THAT DAY SEE SEE SEE BOARD OF GOVERNORS COMMISSIONED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ON IMPROVING CITY. IN RESPONSE TO THIS TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE STATE CREATED THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF C. T. ACROSS THE STATE. AND ALSO IMPROVING THE ALIGNMENT OF C. T. PROGRAMS WITH REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. CURRENTLY THE STATE PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION ONGOING FOR THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THIS AMOUNT SUPPLEMENT THE PORTION FUNDING FOR THE STATE ALSO PROVIDES FOR CITY INSTRUCTION THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE INTENT IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME CITY PROGRAMS HAVE HIGHER INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS RELATED TO SMALLER CLASS SIZES IN EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT. AND ALSO TO FACILITATE THE REGIONAL PLANNING AND COORDINATION THAT THIS PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED AROUND. ON THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE'VE DETAILED WHAT THIS FOR THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE STATE IS CURRENTLY DIVIDED INTO EIGHT REGIONAL CONSORTIA OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THESE ARE DIFFERENT FROM THAT AT ALL AND REGIONAL CONSORTIA WE DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. THE STRONG WORK FORCE CONSORTIA ARE. CONSISTING OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEY'RE REQUIRED TO COLLABORATE WITH REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR IT'S AN INDUSTRY LEADERS. TO DEVELOP REGIONAL PLANS. THEY'RE ALSO REQUIRED TO USE LABOR MARKET DATA TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY INDUSTRY SECTORS IN WHICH TO SPEND THEIR STRONG WORK FORCE FUND. CURRENTLY FUNDING FOR EACH REGIONAL CONSORTIUM IS ALLOCATED BY FORMULA THE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CITY ENROLLMENTS IN THE REGION AS WELL AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. AND STARTING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE'S ALSO BEEN A PERFORMANCE SPACE COMPONENT OF THIS FUNDING FORMULA. FINALLY THE BOTTOM FOR HAND OUT WE EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS THE FUNDS ONCE THAT ALLOCATED TO EACH REGIONAL CONSORTIUM. IN BRIEF 60% OF EACH REGIONAL CONCESSIONS ALLOCATION GOES DIRECTLY TO THE DISTRICTS WHERE IS THE REMAINING 40% IS ALLOCATED TO CONSORTIUM WHICH HAS DISCRETION ON HOW BEST TO USE THEM FOR REGIONAL PRIORITIES. INCLUDES OUR OVERVIEW OF STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM COLLEGES AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BERMAN OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MACHON NEW AND WITH THE PART. HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES FROM WORKFORCE PROGRAM -- WHICH IS THE SAME LEVEL OF FUNDING AS FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MADE A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO SWAP SOME OF THE ALLOCATION FOR RE APPROPRIATED AND SETTLE UP FUNDS TO REFLECT AVAILABLE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE'LL BE MONITORING REVENUES AND THE LEVEL OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AS WE APPROACHED. OKAY SURE [inaudible] IS BETTER. WE WILL BE MONITORING REVENUES AND THE LEVEL OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AS WE APPROACH THE MAYOR VISION BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO FIND. THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM AT ITS EXISTING LEVEL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU COMMUNITY COLLEGES. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MATTHEW ROBERTS I'M WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES OVERSEEING STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM -- I HAVE A HANDOUT THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU A PASSED OUT IN ITS THE POWER POINT -- THAT WILL GO OVER SOME OF THE METRICS ON SOME OF THE OUTCOMES THAT. HAVE BEEN SORT OF TALKED ABOUT SO FAR TODAY -- FIRST OF ALL THOUGH LET ME JUST JUMP IN AND SAY THAT -- THE CHANCES OFFICE -- IS HAS ROLLED OUT THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AND THE SUCCESS METRICS OF WHICH THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM OUTCOMES AND METRICS WILL ALIGN AND SORT OF ROLL UP -- TO THE THE WITH THE OUTCOMES FOR STRONG WORK FORCE ARE STILL INTACT BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY AN ALIGNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE VISION FOR SUCCESS -- IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PROGRAM SO -- THE WORK FIRST DEVELOPMENT MISSIONS GOING ON TO PAGE THREE REALLY TALKS ABOUT. THE TYPES OF STUDENTS THAT WERE AFTER MUCH OF WHAT WAS TALKED ABOUT TODAY WITH ADULT ED TYPES OF STUDENTS -- WE REALLY FOCUS ON DEGREE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS SEEKING STUDENTS SHORT TERM CAREER EDUCATION STUDENTS. AND THOSE ARE STUDENTS THAT COME TO US FOR ONE OR TWO COURSES SEEKING A CERTIFICATE A SHORT TERM CERTIFICATE OR TO UP SKILL -- AND THEN ALSO ON BOARDING AN OFF BOARDING WITH THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM SO WE'RE HAPPY THAT THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED THOSE AVENUES FOR CAREER EDUCATION -- MOVING ON TO THE METRICS THEMSELVES ON THE PAGE -- FOR THESE ARE CAREER EDUCATION FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IN THE CHARTS THAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS ON THE VERY RIGHT HAND SIDE THERE'S A GOLDEN. VERTICAL LINE THAT WAS AS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STRONG WORKFORCE AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SO THE EFFECTS OF THE DATA AFTER THAT LINE WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO SAY THAT THESE WERE. SORT OF FIELD BY STRONG WORKFORCE YOU CAN SEE THE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT. FOR OVERTIME FOR CAREER EDUCATION HAS INCREASED FROM -- FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FROM EIGHT SIXTY EIGHT EIGHT SIXTY THREE I'M NOT GONNA READ THESE TO YOU INDIVIDUALLY BUT CAREER EDUCATION STUDENTS EARNING A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE OVER TIME. ON THE NEXT ON THE NEXT SLIDE -- INCREASED IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS FROM 720-002-77000. MOVING DOWN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE EMPLOYMENT AND EARNINGS OUTCOMES WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THOSE COME IN -- THIS IS A DATA SET THAT GOES MORE PARTICULAR INTO THE SUCCESS METRICS TO LOOK AT THIS. AND SO THE THE SAMPLE GETS A LITTLE BIT MORE FINE TUNE BUT YOU CAN SEE THE THE HUGE INCREASE IN -- NUMBER OF STUDENTS EARNING AN ANNUAL EARNINGS OF SHORT TERM CAREER EDUCATION STUDENTS GOING UP FROM THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND TO FORTY TWO THOUSAND SO ENSURING THAT THAT THAT LIVABLE WAGE IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO TARGET AS PART OF THE LEGISLATION. THE SUCCESS METRICS ALSO TALK ABOUT THE MEDIAN CHANGING SHORT TERM CAREER EDUCATION EARNINGS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A VERTICAL LINE THAT SORT OF GOES UP TO THE RIGHT FROM 51% 253% AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE LAST ONE LITTLE PRESENT IN TERMS OF DATA OR SHORT TERM CAREER EDUCATION STUDENTS TO ATTAIN. THE LIVING WAGE YOU CAN SEE A DRAMATIC INCREASE FROM 58% 262% OVER THE TWO YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. SO WE ARE SEEING. DEFINITE SIGNS OF OF MOVEMENT IN OUR SYSTEM ESPECIALLY ALONG C. T. CREATING MORE AND BETTER -- CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS OF THEY CAN ACCESS. WANT TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE THAT TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THE REGION'S THEMSELVES AND THE OUT THE LA -- PRESENTED SOME GREAT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR REGION SO I WON'T GO TOO DEEP. BUT AVOIDING DUPLICATION ENSURING THE COLLABORATION IS TAKING PLACE AMONG THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IN A REGIONAL ECONOMY IS EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND TAKING PLACE -- WITH -- WITH OTHER INITIATIVES SUCH AS K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE FOR SEEING AN EVEN MORE DIVE DOWN INTO THE INDIVIDUAL SUBREGIONS -- TO ENGAGE WITH MORE PARTICULAR -- STAKEHOLDER SO WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT THAT AND ALL FOCUS ON THESE OUTCOMES HOW DO WE GENERATE THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE LABOR MARKET INFORMATION DRIVEN. BUT ALSO ATTAINING THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE AFTER. AND THE FOCUS ON EVIDENCE I WON'T TAKE YOU THROUGH THE REGION'S THEMSELVES I THINK YOU YOU ALL SORT OF KNOW WHERE THE REGIONS ARE BUT THERE IS A MAP IN HERE JUST IN CASE. TERMS OF REGIONAL NEEDS AN INVESTMENTS LET ME JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THESE FAURIA NORTH FAR NORTH WHICH IS SACRAMENTO -- TO THE TO THE OREGON BORDER. THE HIGHEST INVESTMENT FOR STRONG WORK FORCE DOLLARS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN. IN HEALTH 418% FOLLOWED BY -- AGRICULTURE WATER ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES FOLLOWED BY BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND YOU CAN SEE OTHER ONES LIKE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS SO IN TERMS OF THE SECTOR -- THE SECTOR DR -- STRONGWORK FORCES DEFINITELY HAVING AN EFFECT SO THAT'S FOR YOUR REFERENCE. YOU KNOW THE ALLOCATION FORMULA WHICH HAS BEEN SET OUT IN LEGISLATION. FUNDING BY REGIONS THE NICE THING THAT. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE GOING FORWARD IS THE STABILITY OF THE FUNDING. TO ENSURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS DO CONTINUE TO GO OUT TO MOVE STUDENTS FORWARD AND SO THAT'S I THINK IN TERMS OF OUR OUR MISSION GOING FORWARD. YOU ALSO HAVE EXPENDITURES BY CATEGORY AS MORE OF A DRILL DOWN TO YOU -- AND THEN ALSO THE USE OF THE SET ASIDE FUNDS HAVE REALLY HELPED US TO DRIVE THE DATA SETS -- MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA IS VISUALIZE WHICH BY THE WAY. LAUNCH FOR DATA IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ASK FOR OPENNESS AND AT A PUBLIC FACING ON AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS PUBLIC FACING FOR YOU -- THE OTHER USES OF STATE SET ASIDES OR TO SUPPORT NEW CURRICULUM AND JUST ACCESS HOW DO WE BUILD PROGRAMS QUICKLY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU -- BUT I DO HAVE A ABOUT A QUESTION THAT WAS ON IN THE AGENDA AND ALSO ON THIS CHART. YEAH I KNOW EARLY IN THE STRONG WORK FORCE. ROLL OUT THE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE EFFECTIVENESS. NO REPORTS -- COMING. ONE THING THAT KIND OF YOU KNOW. IS AYE POPPING IS HOW MUCH IS SPENT ON YOUR CAPITAL THE AND SALARIES ROUGHLY 50% AND HOW MUCH IS GOING [inaudible] TO NON. CORE ISSUES THAT SAYS ADMIN SO HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT IS SUCH A TOP PRIORITY. IT'S A LITTLE BIT MONEY IS GOING OUT TO ACTUALLY PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS AND LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE REALLY TOP HEAVY. I THINK ONE OF THE CHRISTMAS MONEY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SITTING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED -- WAS NOTED AS HIGH A QUICKENING COSTS FOR CERTAIN C. T. PROGRAMS THE ABILITY -- IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS WE NEED -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN THE HIGH COST OF FACILITIES IN HIGH CONSEQUENCE SO I THINK YOU SEE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. BEING SPENT ON THAT I WOULD SAY -- THE 26% -- DEAN ROBERTS CAN HELP ME OUT YOU KNOW IT I WOULD NOT. I THINK WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION THAT THAT'S ALL ADMIN THAT FOR SOME OF THIS WORK YOU KNOW I THINK. A KEY PROBLEM STATEMENT OF OF A STRONG WORK FORCE A REPORT WAS THAT -- OUR COLLEGES NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF LINKING UP WITH THE WORK FORCE LINKING UP WITH OTHER PRO OP PROGRAM PROVIDERS -- I WOULD ARGUE THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF WHAT WE ARE FUNDING IN THAT -- IN THAT BLUE CHUNK IN YOUR AGENDA RICK -- AROUND OTHER SERVICES AND COSTS. BUT I GUESS TWO THINGS ONE YOU SAY EQUIPMENT BUT EQUIPMENT IS WELL I'M COUNTING THAT AS A AS AN APPROPRIATE SOMETHING AND NON EQUIPMENT AND NON INSTRUCTIONAL. SALARY SO. WILL THIS CHANGE OVER TIME BECAUSE IT DOES LOOK LIKE YOU'RE NOT FOCUSING THE CORE OF WHAT MATTERS THE MOST WHICH IS WE DEFINITELY WILL SEE A SHIFT. LIKE -- VICE-CHANCELLOR'S MEN A MENTION THE FIRST YEAR ROLLOUT IT'S ABOUT SECURING THE SPACE IN SECURING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO DO THE WORK. WE KNOW FULL WELL THAT OUR FACULTY OR THE ONES THAT YOU KNOW OR THAT POINT WHERE THE CONTACT IS WITH STUDENTS AND SO. NATURALLY WHEN WE SEE EXPANSION OF OUR PROGRAMS GOING TO SEE EXPANSION OF SOME FACULTY -- THESE ARE THESE ARE ALSO POSITIONS THAT ARE SUCH LIKE PLACEMENT OFFICERS -- SO THEIR JOB PLACEMENT AGENTS THAT HAVE BEEN HIRED INTO THE INTO THE COLLEGES. SO WHAT THE COLLEGES REALIZES THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB -- GOING FROM CONTINUING TO CONTINUE ON AND SO THE THE LIFT IN AND IN SALARIES WOULD BE TO SORT OF HELP WITH THAT THOSE THOSE CONNECTIONS SO -- BUT WE DON'T FOR SEE THAT THOSE HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE WE WANT TO SEE MORE NON CREDIT TO CREDIT WE WANT TO SEE MORE CONTRACT AT THE NON CREDIT TO CREDIT WE WANT TO SEE MORE INVOLVEMENT UP ALL OF THE PROGRAMS OUT THERE -- SOMEWHERE MESSAGING THIS TO THE FIELD AS WELL. BLESS WHATEVER I'VE JUST SAY THAT -- I THINK PART OF THIS IS DUE TO THE NEWNESS THAT A LOT OF COLLEGES -- IN I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO USE THESE DOLLARS -- FOR PARTICULARLY COMPENSATION FOR FACULTY GIVE AND NOT THINK THERE IN GENERAL TENDS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HOW STABLE AND HOW SECURE CATEGORICAL PROGRAM DOLLARS ARE AND WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE FOR COLLEGES TO INVEST IN THAT KIND OF COSTS. I THINK AS THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES -- HAVING SHOULD THERE BE STABILITY I THINK YOU'LL SEE MORE OF THOSE DOLLARS GOING INTO. THOSE TYPES OF LONG TERM COMMITMENTS. OKAY. MR O'DONNELL AT THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO THE PROGRAM STARTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IF THAT'S CORRECT CORRECT IN THERE BUT THERE IS REALLY REALLY BEEN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT. IS THAT ACCURATE [inaudible] FTS. YEAH THE F. T. S. RATES ARE THAT WAS THE INCREASE -- THAT USE THAT YOU SAW ON THE IN THE CHART RIGHT -- THE COLLEGE IS COMING OUT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LEVELING OFF OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ENROLLMENT ACROSS THE STATE AND AND I DO UNDERSTAND IN BOTH SYSTEMS K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT THERE'S AN OVERALL DECLINE IN ROMANS WERE. REDRESSING THAT AS WELL THAT'S PART OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES I JUST I I THINK JUST. TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT THAT -- YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR OF YOUR ENROLLMENT IS HAPPENING AT A TIME WHEN -- OVERALL SYSTEM ROMAN IS -- IS STABLE AND IN MANY COMMUNITIES DECLINING SO I TAKE LINING UP. WHAT'S THAT YEAH THE CLINIC AND SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT I I WOULD JUST SAY THE OTHER YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE GOALS WAS CAPACITY. ANOTHER GOAL HAS BEEN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF C. T. E. I THINK THE MEASURES ARE MEASURES AROUND EARNINGS AFTER A PROGRAM. ARE IMPORTANT WAY IN WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ARE WE IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF CG THAT THE BUT SYSTEMS OFFERED TO BASICALLY BACK TO THE ENROLLMENT ISSUE. BASE OF THE ARGUMENT OVER ALMOST DROP AT CT ENROLLMENT IS UP SLIGHTLY AS THAT YEAH THE GROWTH FACTOR YET BY EIGHT BY PUSHING THESE DOLLARS THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE INCREASING THE ENROLLMENT OR THE OR THE NUMBER STUDENTS THAT ARE ATTENDING C. T. PROGRAMS. SPECIFICALLY SAME THING GOES WITH FACILITIES TO THOSE FACILITIES BENEFITS HE TV PROGRAMS AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR COLLEGES AND IN INTO TWO CAMPS CAN CAN THE STRONG WORK FORCE DOLLARS BE USED FOR SALARIES. YES THEY CAN WHAT WE DO THERE IS THERE'S THERE'S RECOMMEND ONE YEAR HOW DOES THAT WORK BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAMS ON GOING. IT'S WE RECOMMEND TO COLLEGES THAT BASED ON BEST PRACTICES THAT THEY BECAUSE THIS IS A CATEGORICAL. THAT THEY SINK AND MULTIPLE SOURCES TO TO SORT OF FUN THESE POSITIONS -- ANOTHER WORDS. NO MORE THAN 75% COMES OUT OF ONE FUND RIGHT INTO FINDING A POSITION SO THAT THEIR BRAIDING FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT POSITION STAYS AROUND AS AS IT GOES FORWARD. SO I TYPES OF FLUCTUATIONS TO THE TO THE DOLLARS TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW LONG IS A REMAINING CATEGORICAL WHY WOULD IT REMAIN ACCOUNTING OR WHY WOULD TO BE. BUILT INTO PART OF YOUR REGULAR AN INSTRUCTIONAL FUNDING AT SOME POINT WHEN IS IT FLIP. YEAH NO SO FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE I I THINK BY CATEGORICAL WE ARE JUST SAYING FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE THIS FALLS OUTSIDE OF OUR GENERAL PURPOSE OF FUNDING TO BE ALLOCATED THE COLLEGES. I THINK ON A WIDER. WELL THAT'S A NEW INCENTIVIZE YOU TO DO IT I'M I'M I'M I'M I'M LOOKING OF THE K. TWELVE MODEL MONEY WISE AND THAT SAME THING HERE. I THINK THAT INSTEAD OF EYES IT GIVE YOU THE COUNTY. IT WAS FUNNY SOMEONE SAID THE CHAIR NOTED CAPITAL OUTLAY WAS SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND. YES THE END AND BY CATEGORICAL MAYBE I'LL JUST SAY WE THE STATE HAS RESTRICTED THIS TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION FOUR PER BY KIND OF STRONG WORKFORCE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PURPOSES. DISTRICTS ON THE MONEY WE ALLOCATE PART OF THE MONEY MOST OF THE MONEY TO DISTRICTS SOME OF THE MONEY TO REGIONS AND THE REGION'S EVENTUALLY ALLOCATED TO DISTRICTS. WHEN IT GETS TO THE DISTRICT ARE HOPING I THINK CHANCELLOR OAKLEY HAS MENTIONED TO THE FIELD MENTIONED HERE BEFORE OUR HOPE IS THAT DISTRICTS ARE TAKING ALL THE DOLLARS THEY'RE GETTING? USING THEM TOWARDS A COORDINATED PROGRAM I THINK THAT CONCERNED -- OFTEN AT A DISTRICT LEVELS AROUND THE RESTRICTIONS OF FUNDING THE MAIN CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE -- TO INKER LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS WITH A DOLLARS LIKE THESE -- WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN USE DOLLARS CAN BE BOB THESE TYPES OF DOLLARS SET ASIDE -- APPROPRIATIONS IN THE BUDGET CAN BE -- MORE VOLATILE LESS SECURE THAN OTHER TYPES OF FUNDING GREAT THANK YOU NOTE TO MAKE TWO COMMENTS -- IN I DO WORRY ABOUT THE CONSORTIUM ON ALL. THE STUFF CENTERS THE CONSORTIUM THIS. YOU KNOW THE SOVIET BLOCKING GETS LOST AND THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW TOO MUCH BUREAUCRATIC -- ACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS PAPERWORK DECISIONS YOU MADE THEIR POLITICAL DECISIONS INHERENTLY IF YOU'RE IN A CONSORTIUM COARSER BUT IT'LL YOU CAN'T TELL ME THEY'RE NOT. RIGHT THERE IS GOING TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR OWN THEIR OWN BECAUSE SO THAT'S JUST ONE CONCERN I ALL I ALSO HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM COLLEGE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS LOOKING AT BREAKING DOWN -- THE BARRIERS WITH REGARD. TO THE TIME ASSOCIATED TO ACHIEVE A CERTIFICATE OR NAME WHEN I MEAN BY THAT I MEAN THE CAREER IN A YEAR APPROACH. RIGHT DOWN THE SEMESTER THINKING. SO THAT WE JUST KEEP GOING THROUGH BECAUSE I MEAN THERE'S A LOT THERE ARE SOME EVEN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS OTHER THAN OVER PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT THAT DO IT IN A MUCH. QUICKER FASHION ALBEIT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IN A MUCH MORE RAPID FASHION GETS YOU KNOW THEIR STUDENTS INTO THE WORK FORCE. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK YOU KNOW STRONG WORKFORCE LIVES ALONG WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER YOU KNOW EFFORTS THAT YOU KNOW GUIDED PAHWAYS IS OUR WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE. STUDENT COMES INTO THE INSTITUTION WITH AN EDUCATIONAL GOAL WE GET THAT STUDENT TO THAT GOAL -- IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE -- YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT APPRENTICESHIP OTHER TYPES OF WORK BASED LEARNING -- CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING SO THERE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER WORK THAT THIS -- HOPEFULLY WILL BECOME MORE ALIGNED WITH MOVING FORWARD. AND JUST ONE MORE QUESTION A QUESTION WITH THE NEW -- FOR FUNDING FORMULA IT'S NOT GOING TO DISSUADE -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE FROM SERVING THE STUDENTS WHO DON'T WANT TO GET. A NA OR DON'T WANT TO TRANSFER. TO A TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY CORRECT THAT'S NOT THE INTENT THE GOAL OF IN THE FUNDING FORMULA THERE ARE MEASURES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT TRYING TO TARGET THIS STUDENT CHURNING IS HOW WE'VE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IT -- COMPLETION OF NINE OR MORE CT FACT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION UNITS ATTAINMENT OF REGIONAL LIVING WAGE UPON AG SAID I THINK MOVING FORWARD WE NEED TO EVALUATE THAT TO COLLEGES FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME INCENTIVE TO PRIORITIZE CERTAIN STUDENTS OVER OTHERS. AND IF WERE SAYING THAT I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW IS -- GOING TO INFORM OUR CONVERSATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS TO OFFER TRICKS TO THE FORMULA. THANK YOU. SAY NO OTHER QUESTIONS WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN ISSUE NUMBER THREE K. TWELVE CT [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] HEY MICHELLE ALL RIGHT. MORNING. AGAIN LA OF FIRST AND FINANCE DEPARTMENT OF ED CAN COLLEGES. GOOD MORNING RYAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. CAN BE PRESENTING FROM A HANDOUT THAT THE SERGEANTS JUST PREPARING TO HAVE. REAL QUICK. IT'S A PRETTY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW. I'D STARTING OUT WITH A REMINDER THAT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS ORGANIZED THE STATE WORKFORCE INTO -- FIFTEEN INDUSTRY SECTORS AND FOR EACH OF THESE INDUSTRY SECTORS THEY'VE DEVELOPED SPECIFIC CURRICULUM GUIDELINES FOR C. T. PROGRAMS. THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE OBJECTIVES OF THESE PROGRAMS SURE MANY OF YOU OF VISITED CT PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE OF LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS AND MUCH OF WHAT THEY DO THERE LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT FROM -- TYPICAL HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM BUT MANY WAYS THE GOALS ARE PRETTY COURTS TO THE MISSION OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION THEY AND COULD PROMOTING STERN ENGAGEMENTS TURN STUDENTS FROM MORE ENGAGED WHEN THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING HANDS ON A TEACHING TECHNICAL SKILLS OF COURSE. TO INCREASE EMPLOYEE ABILITY AMONG THOSE STRANDS BUT ALSO TEACHING SOFT SKILLS JUST LIKE. SHOWING UP TO WORK ON TIME. IN ADDITION TO THAT -- CT PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO HELP THE STATE MADE ITS PARTICULAR WORK FOR SCHOOLS. NOW HISTORICALLY IN THIS THE THIRD PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. THE STATE HAS SUPPORTED HIGH SCHOOL CT PROGRAMS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. I'M PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WHICH IS TO SAY PRIOR TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. IS A VARIETY OF SMALLER PROGRAMS THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS CALLED. REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL CENTERS AND PROGRAMS. MANY OF THESE WERE ELIMINATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF LCF F. AND FROM 200-013-1422. THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CT WAS -- SUPPORTED PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THEY'LL CFF. INCLUDED A HIGHER HIGH SCHOOL A BASE RATE THAN WAS PROVIDED FOR OTHER GREATS IN PART TO RECOGNIZE THE COST OF CITY PROGRAMS. AND THROUGH SOME LIMITED TERM CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AND SPECIFICALLY. A PROGRAM CALLED THE CITY IN AN INCENTIVE GRANT THIS WAS. A PROGRAM THAT WAS DESIGNED TO LAST FOR THREE YEARS PROVIDED -- DECREASING AMOUNT OF STATE SUPPORT AND AN INCREASING LOCAL MATCH. ODD BUT BY THE TIME THAT WE CAME AROUND -- TO THE AND THE PLANNED EXPIRY OF THIS PROGRAM UGH THERE WAS A GREAT INTEREST AMONG BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AND CONTINUING TO SUPPORT CITY THROUGH A CATEGORICAL APPROACH. AND WHAT WE ENDED UP DOING IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WAS ACTUALLY CREATE TWO SEPARATE. ONGOING PROGRAMS BOTH. OF RECEIVING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE ANNUALLY THE FIRST OF THESE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THE SEATING INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM. MRS IT MINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SUPPORTED SO HIGH SCHOOL IS ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS -- IT HAS A TWO TO ONE LOCAL MATCHING. OF REQUIREMENTS SO SCHOOLS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO DOLLARS OTHER LC A FAT FOR OTHER FUNDS SOURCES FOR EVERY. DOLLAR EARNED DEDICATED FUNDING THEY RECEIVED FOR THIS PROGRAM. ON THE SECOND PROGRAM WAS A HIGH SCHOOL A COMPONENT OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT SO. THIS WORKS VERY SIMILAR TO THE EXISTING STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IT'S ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. UGH THE FUNDING IS PROVIDED TO THE REGIONAL CONSORTIA BASED ON A FORMULA AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. AND THEN THE CONSORTIA AWARD THOSE ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS TO SCHOOLS IN THEIR AREA. AGAIN THIS IS A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ON GOING AND IT'S A TWO TO ONE LOCAL MATCH. NOW. A IN ADDITION TO THIS CATEGORICAL FUNDING THIS IS ON PAGE FOR THE HAND -- OF WE ARE SUPPORTING CT THROUGH AT THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THAT WAS INTRODUCED ALONG WITH L. CFF. SO ALL DISTRICTS UNDER LCF REQUIRED TO DEVELOP STRATEGIC PLANS THAT OUTLINE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MEET. US WIDE RANGE OF OBJECTIVES FOR STUDENT OUTCOMES AMONG THOSE IS PREPARING STUDENTS -- FOR BOTH COLLEGE AND THEIR CAREER. DODD TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PLANS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR SUCCESSFUL OF WE ALSO INTRODUCED. THIS SCHOOL DASHBOARD WHICH SHOWS SOME. INDICATOR DATA -- REVEALING HOW SUCCESSFUL SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN IN ACHIEVING THOSE OUTCOMES AMONG THOSE INDICATORS IS THE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR THAT'S OUTLINED A AND THE LAST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT PAGE. FIVE THE IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY HERE IS THAT -- IT STUDENTS CAN QUALIFY AS PREPARED UNDER THE INDICATOR -- IN PART BY COMPLETING SOME CT COURSE WORK. OUT THEM LATEST DATA WE HAVE FROM THE INDICATOR -- SUGGEST THAT WE STILL SOME WORK TO DO A ABOUT 40% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY. CLASSIFIED AS PREPARED IN AND IT DIGITAL 20% IS APPROACHING PREPARED BUT THAT STILL LEAVES THAT'S THE END OF MY INTRODUCTORY REMARKS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS LENA GRANT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY REITERATING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. BRINGING TOTAL LCF OF FUNDING TO SIXTY THREE BILLION. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IN ADDITION AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO TWO POINT 6% OF THE LC FF BASE GRANT IS PROVIDED THROUGH THE NINE THROUGH TWELVE GREAT SENATE JUST MEANT. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHER COST OF PROVIDING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. THIS BAY GRANT BASED GRANT ADJUSTMENT AMOUNTS TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN BUILT AND ON TOP OF THE ELSE YET THAT SPACE. UGH BASE AMOUNT THE CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT ROBUST CT PROGRAMS TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE LOCAL PRIORITY. FUNDING ALLOCATED THROUGH THE LC FF SHOULD PAY FOR A FULL RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL COSTS INCLUDING CT. NESTED BY THE ELEVATOR LA -- IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT HIGH QUALITY SEE TV PROGRAMS PLAY A VALUABLE ROLE IN PREPARING STUDENTS TO MEET THE STATE THE STATE'S LABOR MARKET DEMANDS. THE BUDGET MAINTAINS THE ONGOING INVESTMENT THAT WERE NEGOTIATED AS PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET. FOR BOTH CITY INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM AND THE KIDS WERE% TWELVE COMPONENT OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AN ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IS PROVIDED FOR THE LOCAL GRANTS. TO KATE K. THROUGH TWELVE ENTITIES UNDER EACH PROGRAM. AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS AN ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IS PROVIDED TO SUPPORT A REGIONAL LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE TO ASSIST TEACHERS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS IN IMPLEMENTING HIGH QUALITY C. T. PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS TWO MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED TO SUPPORT REGIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADMINISTERING THE TWELVE K. THROUGH TWELVE COMPONENT OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. THESE PROGRAMS ALONG WITH THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE LC A FAST HELP TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN EFFECTIVE. HIGH QUALITY CITY PROGRAMS THAT ARE A LINE NOT ONLY THE WITH COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS STANDARDS. BUT ALSO WITH THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS INDUSTRY AND LABOR -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT MAKES SEVERAL TECHNICAL CHANGES.

THESE CHANGES ARE PROPOSED IN RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE CALIFORNIA WORK FORCE PATHWAYS JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND AS WELL US FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM STICKLE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. FINALLY AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL CENTER.

HELLO AGAIN MY NAME'S MATT ROBERTS ON WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CANCERS OFFICE GOOD MORNING TO THE TO THECOMMITTEE THIS MORNING. I'M HERE TO PRESENT ON K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE IN THIS FIRST YEAR REALLY IT'S A PLEASURE TO SIT AT THE TABLE WITH C. D. E. AND AND HAVE SORT OF OUR MARCHING ORDERS -- TO BUILD SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY LINK BACK AND FORTH WHEN I READ SOME OF THE GREAT DATA THAT'S COMING OUT OF SOME OF THE ELLIE ETS -- WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DATA SAID SORT OF MOVES FORWARD IN TELLING THE STORY HOW STUDENTS GO ON TO COLLEGE AND CAREER. ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF GAINING. THE TYPES OF WORK FORCE OUTCOMES THAT WERE AFTER SO WE'VE BEEN HAPPY TO THINK SIT DOWN WITH CD AND WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM -- ALSO THE THE CALIFORNIA JOINT WORK FORCE ADVISORY BOARD HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE. PARTICIPANT IN NOT ONLY THE RE AUTHORIZATION OF PERKINS BUT ALSO SORT OF THE SHEPHERDING OF OUR METRICS AND BOTH SYSTEMS FOR BOTH SEATED AGAIN THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE. SO THAT'S BEEN A VALUABLE PIECE IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THE POLICIES WRAPAROUND THE TYPES OF ENGAGEMENT IN THE TYPES OF CONNECTIONS THAT WERE AFTER SO -- SO WE IN THIS FIRST YEAR OF ROLL OUT OF K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIMELINE WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT SEE TAKE ROLLED OUT -- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WASN'T SORT OF APPLICATION OVERLOAD FOR THE FIELD BECAUSE THERE WERE TWO TWO SEPARATE APPLICATIONS WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD NOW AND AS APPLICATIONS OF COME IN AS OF MARCH FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FOR K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE. WE'RE NOW LOOKING TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE CONNECTION WAS C. TAKE APPLICANTS VERSES APPLICANTS FOR K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE. HOW ARE THESE DOLLARS BEING USED FOR THE DOLLARS BEING LEVERAGED TOGETHER -- WHERE IS THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT SORT OF THEIR -- THAT THEY'RE PLAYING AND AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN THE ROLL OUT OF THIS WE HAD TWO GOALS ONE IS TO GIVE ALL ELEAZAR ACCESS TO FUNDING -- AND NUMBER TWO TO LET FOLKS KNOW WHAT THE NEXT STEPS WERE TO APPLY FOR DOLLARS SO MOST OF OUR SYSTEMS FOR APPLYING -- ONLINE THROWN OVER PROCESS -- WHICH WAS BEEN VERY GOOD IN TERMS OF US BEING ABLE TO COLLECT DATA. AND I DO HAVE SOME APPLICATION DATA FOR YOU THAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE -- IN THIS FIRST ROUND WE HAD A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE LETTERS OF IN INTENSE OR LETTERS OF INTEREST THAT WERE SUBMITTED FROM THE FIELD. AS A FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OF THOSE. OF THOSE LETTERS OF INTENT WE RECEIVED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT APPLICATIONS -- OVERALL ACROSS THE STATE. THE LARGEST NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVED AS ARE MOST MOST RURAL AREA AND THAT'S FROM SACRAMENTO TO THE OREGON BORDER WE RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN APPLICATIONS. AS YOU KNOW MANY OF THE DISTRICTS AND THE NORTH FOR NORTH AREA OR BELOW TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY A OR STUDENT ENROLLMENT. AND SO WE'RE REALLY REALLY. PLEASE TO TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS WORKING WE'RE AFTER INCENTIVIZING THE GROWTH OF OUR CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY IN OUR RURAL AREAS. ESPECIALLY IN OUR AREAS THAT ARE HIT BY -- HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT YET MIGHT NOT HAVE THE POPULATION -- ANOTHER AREA AS YOU GO DOWN AS I GO DOWN THIS LIST THE BAY AREA HAD SIXTY NINE APPLICATIONS. THE CENTRAL VALLEY MOTHER LODE FROM STOCKTON -- DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD AT SIXTY SIX SOUTH CENTRAL COAST WHICH IS OUR SMALLEST AT SEVEN SHOWS THE LEVEL OF INTEGRATION WHAT'S GOING ON THERE -- SAN DIEGO IMPERIAL THIRTY TWO AND I HAVE TO SAY. A NUMBER OF THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE COMING FROM IMPERIAL COUNTY. THE FOLKS DOWN THERE ARE ARE HUNGRY AND READY FOR THE TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PRESENT AROUND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND AROUND CREATION OF PROGRAMS THAT REALLY MOVE STUDENTS INTO JOBS -- THE INLAND EMPIRE DESERT REGION HAD FORTY SEVEN THERE'S A LOT OF PARITY BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THAT AREA. A LOS ANGELES AT NINETY THREE A LARGE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS. PROBABLY THE SECOND HIGHEST COMPARED TO THE MOST RURAL AREA. AND THEN LASTLY ORANGE COUNTY HAD. SEVENTEEN THE TOTAL DOLLARS THAT WERE REQUESTED WERE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION AND AS YOU KNOW THE ALLOCATION AMOUNTS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. SO HERE AGAIN MUCH LIKE WHAT MICHELLE PRESENTED FOR C. TECH -- THE NEED SEEMS TO BE OUT OUT PACING WHAT THE DOLLAR SIR ARE AVAILABLE ARE SO IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OVER WHAT WHAT'S AVAILABLE. UP WE'RE CURRENTLY RUNNING. SELECTION COMMITTEES PER LEGISLATION AND THE THESE THE SELECTION COMMITTEES ARE ARE WELL REPRESENTED OF AND AND A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF FOLKS REPRESENTING. ANYWHERE FROM OUR PEAS TO WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD FOLKS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ELLIE ACE -- AND SO THEY'RE DELIBERATING ON WHO'S GOING TO GET FUNDING. AND WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF TIMES WITH THESE WITH THESE FOLKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF AUTHORITY OUT OF THE LEGISLATION. TO ENSURE NOT ONLY THAT THE DOLLARS FLOW TO PROGRAMS BUT THAT WERE REALLY MAKING THESE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HOW DO WE SEQUENCE STUDENTS FROM SECONDARY TO POST SECONDARY. IF WE WERE TO MAKE A DENT IN THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE SEE THIS PROGRAM SORT OF DELIVERING FOR US IS HOW DO WE REALLY SHINE A LIGHT ON THAT ON THAT PIECE. OF THE APPLICATIONS ARE LIKE I SAID ARE CURRENTLY BEING SCORED THE FINAL DECISIONS WILL GO OUT BY APRIL THIRTIETH. AND DOLLARS WILL FLOW THIS YEAR BEFORE JUNE JUNE FIFTEENTH SO WE HAVE. THINGS IN Q. TWO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THE OTHER PART OF THIS LEGISLATION HAS TO DO WITH KEY TALENT AND I KNOW MACHEL -- GRACIOUSLY THANKED. THE SEATED TAPS WE HAVE SIMILAR TAPS -- OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS THAT WE FUNDED THROUGH SB TEN SEVENTY AND THAT HAVE ENDED AS WELL. SO THE INTENT WITH TRYING TO WEAVE THESE POSITIONS SOMEWHAT TOGETHER WAS TO TRY TO TAKE THE ENDING DOLLARS FOR THESE DISPARATE POSITIONS. MERGE THEM TOGETHER SOMEWHAT AND SEE IF THEY COULD REALLY PROVIDE THAT PIPELINE IN THAT GUIDANCE AND ASSISTANCE TO INSURE THAT PROGRAMS MOVE FORWARD. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE HAVE THE EIGHT REGIONAL FOLKS. THAT WERE CALLED OUT FOR IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT'S IN MOTION WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY FINISHING INTERVIEWS ON IT. THE OTHER SEVENTY TWO BODIES OR SORRY NOT BODIES BUT TALENT WILL. WILL BE ROLLING OUT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS WE HAVE EVERYTHING READY FOR THAT. TO GO SO THESE BUT THESE FOLKS WILL BE IN PLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR -- TO ASSIST WITH -- BUT THE REGIONAL COORDINATION. AND THEN ALSO THE APPLICATION PROCESS I'LL HAVE TO TELL YOU SOME OF THE VIGNETTES STATEMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD AROUND THE STATE. AND I I MADE SURE THAT I WAS THE ONE THAT WENT OUT AND DID ENGAGE BEEN ACROSS THE STATE WE DID THESE ENGAGEMENT MEETINGS WITH ALL EL THE ETS WE ENGAGE WITH PROBABLY. TWELVE TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED FOLKS STATEWIDE -- AND AND THE THINGS THAT THAT FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT IS HOW DO WE INCREASE THE COLLABORATION. THE SAME THING GOES WITH OUR REGIONAL CONSORTIA IT'S HOW DO WE ENGAGE THAT THAT THAT TYPE OF A COLLABORATION TO MAKE IT WHAT MILLBRAE MCLAUGHLIN CALLS. VERY MEANINGFUL IT'S THAT DELIBERATE COLLABORATION THAT WERE AFTER SO WE'RE HAPPY IN THIS FIRST YEAR THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SORT OF GET IT OUT OF THE GATE WITH FIDELITY AS IT'S WRITTEN -- AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT. GOING FORWARD WE ARE LINING OUR METRICS MORE WERE LINING WHERE THAT INVESTMENT IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS STUDENTS MAKE IT SO. THAT'S ALL I HAVE THIS MORNING OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT'S THE QUESTION. ALREADY THIS IS A INFORMATIONAL ITEM FOR THE MISTER DONALD HAS SOME COMMENTS TOO BUT AYE AYES ONCE A WEEK WE ALL SUPPORT -- C. T. E. -- WE WE WE LIKED THE THE K. TWELVE MODEL AND APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION BUT I THINK IT'S OUR INTENT. TO REDIRECT THE ONE FIFTY TO GO BACK TO THE INITIAL -- SYSTEM THAT WE SET OUT THAT I THINK MISTER O'DONNELL IS PROPOSING. IN SOME LEGISLATION IT WILL GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THAT -- I'M NOT SURE GIVE ME JUST MORE MONEY PER SE TO ADD ON TO IT WE'RE READY FOR THE MAY REVISE BUT I THINK THE DESIRE REST IS TO GO BACK TO IT TO A SINGULAR APPROACH THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE THE ACTION. COMING OUT THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN MAY. THANK YOU MISTER DON. YES YEAH JUST JUST TWO COMMENTS GUARD QUICKLY MISTER CHAIR. I THINK -- AS EVIDENCED BY YOUR WHAT THE INFORMATION THE DATA YOU'VE SHARED TODAY WE ARE NOT FUNDING C. T. AN ADEQUATE LEVEL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THERE'S WHAT SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- WAS WHAT PEOPLE SOUGHT YET THERE'S ONLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION AVAILABLE SO THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO FUND C. T.. AND MORE ADEQUATE LEVELS BETTER FOR OUR STUDENTS AND ALSO BETTER FOR THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY -- MY SECOND COMMENT IS THAT -- I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERING K. TWELVE DOLLARS -- AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING SOME EVIDENCE OF THAT NOW. SPLITTING THE THE K. TWELVE IN CT FUNDING INTO TWO PROGRAMS. FROM WHAT I'M HEARING IT IS IT HAS SOME CHALLENGES MAY NOT A ME WORKING. SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES IN TEACHERS SAY THE STRONG WORK WORKS PROGRAM APPLICATIONS IS APPLICATION PROCESS IS BURDENSOME. TAKES EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED HOURS TO COMPLETE EACH APPLICATION. AND THEN THERE'S A SEPARATE APPLICATION REQUIRED FOR EACH PATHWAY. SO -- SIGNIFICANTLY BURDENSOME APPLICATION PROCESS WHO WERE HEARD ABOUT. AND THE METRICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM ARE GEARED TOWARD STUDENTS ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- STUDENTS. GOING DIRECTLY INTO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM ORDER FOR UNIVERSITY WOULD NOT COUNT AS SUCCESS. SO THERE'S A CHALLENGE AND ELEAZAR REPORTING THAT THERE IS A LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CONSORTIUMS AND APPLYING FOR FUNDS. AND YOU KNOW I HAVE MY CONCERNS ABOUT CONSORTIUM -- COMPETITION WISE EXETER AND ALSO JUST JUST MORE BUREAUCRACY WITH REGARD TO PAPERWORK AND LOGISTICS -- AND THEN THERE'S BEEN REPORTS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNWILLING TO COLLABORATE. UNLESS THE CAGE WALL PATHWAY FEEDS INTO THEIR OWN COMMUNITY COLLEGE PATHWAYS I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE -- AND AGAIN I I I THINK WE NEED TO RETURN. THIS FUNDING -- THAT HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MINISTER IT AS THEY DO WITH C. TAKE NOW PROPER PLACE -- WITH THAT I'VE I'VE SAID MY PIECE MISTER CHAIR I TURN IT BACK TO YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THING I WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPENED FOR THE MAY REVISION. ISSUE NUMBER FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION HEY WELL TAKE ROLL REAL QUICK THE REAL [inaudible] MCCARTY [inaudible] GALLAGHER [inaudible] LIMóN [inaudible] MEDINA [inaudible] RCG O'DONNELL. OKAY THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SPECIAL EDUCATION. THANK YOU CHEN MEMBERS MICHELLE A LEADER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. OF WHICH ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION AS ONE TIME FOR EXPANDED SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SCHOOL READINESS SUPPORTS KNOWN AS THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANT. THIS FUNDING IS TARGETED AT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WITH HIGH PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND HIGH RATES OF AND DUPLICATED PUPILS SO STUDENTS WHO ARE -- ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AND YOUTH FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THESE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT SERVICES BEYOND WHAT IS AN INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM AS WELL AS FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES SUCH AS EARLY INTERVENTION AND PRESCHOOL. THE FUNDS CAN ALSO BE USED TO ADOPT STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IDENTIFIED TO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT AS WELL AS TO EXPAND OR BUILD UPON. MULTI MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT EFFORTS ARE AND TSS. BOTH THE ONGOING AND THE ONE TIME FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS PROPOSAL IS A HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY BUT IS ALSO A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT. BY TARGETING ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THIS PROPOSAL AIMSTO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. ESPECIALLY THOSE STUDENTS AND HIGH NEED AREAS AND TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AT RISK OF ACQUIRING RELATED SERVICES. AND WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING RYAN AND HE'S LA UP. RYAN ANDERSON ALEJO. OF WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON THIS ISSUE AND ONE PRIMARY REASON WHY IS THAT. WE DON'T THINK THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THE GOVERNOR STATED INTENT. AS FINANCE JUST NOTED. THEIR INTENT IS THAT THIS FUNDING BE USED FOR EITHER SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THOSE BEING SERVICES THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY PROVIDED TO THOSE. STUDENTS WERE FOR EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORTS WHICH WOULD BE -- EFFORTS OF SCREENING AND CHILDREN FOR BEHAVIORAL OR ACADEMIC CHALLENGES AND PROVIDING THEM SOME SUPPORTS. THAT WOULD DIVERT THEM FROM THE NEED -- FOR BEING IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. NOW THAT'S THEIR INTENT AND THERE IS SOME ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT LIST THESE PURPOSES BUT THE LANGUAGE ITSELF IS NOT CONTROLLING. A BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH DISTRICTS WE THINK THAT THE THE MESSAGE THEY WOULD RECEIVE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS. IS -- FROM ITS TITLE SPECIAL EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANTS DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE SAYING THAT RISING SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS ARE ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY -- FISCAL CONCERNS AT THIS MOMENT -- THEY'RE ASKING SPECIFICALLY FOR MORE CATEGORICAL FUNDING TO COVER THOSE EXISTING SERVICES AND WE BELIEVE THAT ABSENT CONTROLLING -- SPENDING RESTRICTIONS THEY WILL INTERPRET THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE. NAY IN ADDITION WE THINK THAT THE ALLOCATION FORMULA THAT WAS PROPOSED TO SPECIFICALLY MISALIGNED WITH THE INTENT OF REDUCING IDENTIFICATION. OF STUDENTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE SO FEW STUDENTS WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE FUNDING UNDER THAT STUDENTS ARE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- FOR EVERY STUDENT THAT AND IDENTIFIED DISTRICT THE CEASE TO IDENTIFY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION WE ESTIMATE THEY'D LOSE OUT ON OF APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ON GOING FUNDING THAT. THAT SEEMS TO BE AS STRONG FISCAL INCENTIVE NOT TO REDUCE YOUR IDENTIFICATION RIGHT. NOW FINALLY IT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THIS FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT. EXISTING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES WE DO NOT THAT. WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE AS SUPERIOR OPTIONS FOR ALLOCATING SPECIAL EDUCATION KALICH CATEGORICAL FUNDING IN PARTICULAR. IN THE CURRENT FUNDING RATES ARE PROVIDED UNDER THE STATE'S PRIMARY SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING FORMULA. ARE A QUITE UNEQUAL RANGING IN SOME AREAS FROM LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENTS WHO. AND SOME CASES MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT THESE -- INEQUITIES ARE BASED. WHOLLY ON A HISTORICAL FACTORS THEY HAVE NO RATIONAL POLICY BASIS -- WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE. A COULD DEDICATE SOME FUNDING TO EQUALIZING THOSE RATES IN ADDITION -- THERE IS THIS DISCONNECT AS NOTED AND THE AGENDA THAT SCHOOLS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED OFFER SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES THERE FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS BUT THE STATE'S SYSTEM FOR ALLOCATING FUNDING ISBASED ENTIRELY ON K. THROUGH TWELVE ATTENDANCE WHICH MEANS. THERE'S NO FUNDING PROVIDED SPECIFICALLY -- FOR THOSE PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WAIT WAIT THINK AGAIN THE LEGISLATURE COULD DEDICATE FUNDING SOME FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PURPOSE AND THAT WOULD BE SUPERIOR TO THE GOVERNOR'S ALTERNATIVE. AT THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU. KRISTIN RIGHT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- ON BEHALF OF THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND -- THE SUPERINTENDENT IS SUPPORTIVE AND APPRECIATES ALL ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ENSURING THAT OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES HEY WE RECOGNIZE. THAT OUR STATE'S HIGHEST NEED YOUTH OFTEN REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORTS -- TO BE INCLUDED IN SCHOOL -- INCREASED FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION CONTINUES TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE MINDS OF OF AS THE ELIO -- ALSO SEE THE SENTIMENT AT THAT -- FUNDING IS A HUGE ISSUE AROUND SPECIAL EDUCATION IN GENERAL SO ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS -- WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED BOTH FOR DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF ONE OF OUR MOST CHALLENGE SUBGROUPS. OF THE SUPERINTENDENT ALSO THRILLED TO HAVE SPECIAL EDUCATION -- HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE -- AND WE HOPE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR TEACHERS BOTH THE GENERAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS -- THEY ALSO NEED SUPPORT AND MENTORSHIP SO WE SEE THIS AS PART OF A PUZZLE. THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FUNDING IT'S ABOUT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE FUNDING P. SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES THAT'S PREVENTING US FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH MANY OF THE OTHER PIECES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER MEDINA -- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS -- BOTH OF THE ALEJO'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I I I'M GONNA TO SHARE -- RATHER THAN ASK QUESTIONS -- OWNER SHARED THAT I HAVE AUTHORED ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR TWENTY EIGHT WHICH I THINK IT DOES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- ALEJO'S OFFICE AS ALLUDED. TO AND AND THAT IS IT WOULD PROVIDE. SOME THE BILL FOR TWENTY EIGHT WHICH I'VE AUTHORED UP PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED FUNDING FOR THE EQUALIZATION. A SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL SERVICES. WHICH THE LA -- SUGGESTED AND FOR A HIGH COST OF PLACEMENTS. I HEAR FROM MY OWN LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT THE WITH THE LA -- OFFICES SAID THAT THE FUNDING SYSTEM IS A CERTAINLY OUR CAKE AND HAS NO [inaudible] RATIONAL [inaudible] OF BASIS -- EDUCATION FUNDING SYSTEMS PRESENT PRESENT BARRIERS WERE THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES. AGAIN DEBT FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES HAVE VARIED CONSIDERABLY WITHOUT AGAIN ANY RATIONALE. SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THESE INEQUITIES FOR NEARLY FOR DEBT DECADES AND ADDRESSING THEM AS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS. FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL ALSO PRESENTS A BARRIER WERE AGAIN THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITY. IT'S A CRITICAL TIME IN CHILDREN'S LIVES AB FOR TWENTY EIGHT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WITH MOST SEVERE DISABILITIES. WHEN OUR CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED WE HAD SUPPORT BUT THAT SUPPORT WAS ELIMINATED DURING THE RECESSION? LEAVING SCHOOLS WITH NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT HIGHER COSTS PLACEMENTS. ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE BILL THAT I AM PROPOSING ARE COMMONSENSE INVESTMENTS AND FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY FOR OUR VALUED STUDENTS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- AND AND DOING AS MUCH AS WE CAN -- FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING AND BUILDING ON THE WORK BY MY COLLEAGUE MISTER O'DONNELL. ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND I GUESS THIS LEADS TO TO THE QUESTION THAT WE HAD. SPECIAL HEARING ON THIS THIS YEAR. THIS IS THE LIKE EVERY YEAR THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR A DISTRICTS WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT. THE STRESS THEY'RE FACING. WITH THEIR COSTS IN THE NEEDS OF OUR KIDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SPECIAL ED AND WE WE APPRECIATE THAT THE FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION IN THE PROPOSAL. AT AND I GUESS LINGERING ISSUE IS IS THIS THE BEST APPROACH TO GO FORWARD AND I AND WE HAVE THIS. EQUALIZATION IDEA ANOTHER PROPOSAL SO WHEN ASKED APARTMENT A FINANCE ARE YOU -- TAKING A LOOK AT SOME SOME OTHER -- WAYS TO TO ADDRESS -- SPECIAL LET ISSUES AND AND THE INEQUITIES IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE MORE YOU SEE SOMETHING NEW IN THE MAY REVISE. YEAH GREAT QUESTION AB WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS PROPOSAL YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES IN SPECIAL EDUCATION -- THIS PROPOSAL DOESN'T PLAN TO SOLVE ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THE GOVERNOR AND THIS ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT KIND OF THE COMPOUNDING EFFECTS OF POVERTY RATE WHICH IS WHY THIS PROPOSAL LOOKS AT HOW YOU PP RATES THESE DISTRICTS. THAT HAVE A LOT OF HIGH NEED STUDENTS A LOT OF STUDENTS AND POVERTY AND ON TOP OF THAT A LOT OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES -- AND SO THIS PROPOSAL KIND OF LOOKS AT MAKING THIS TARGETED INVESTMENT I THINK MOVING FORWARD INTO THE MAY REVISED -- WE WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE ON ON HOW DO WE SOLVE YOU KNOW THE LARGER ISSUES OF SPECIAL EDUCATION NOT JUST. NOT JUST LOOKING AT THESE HIGH NEED AREAS BUT LOOKING AT UNEQUAL RATES LOOKING AT KIND OF FUNDING FOR PRESCHOOL SOME OF THE THINGS YOU MENTION. THAT DEFINITELY BE WORKING WITH YOU AND HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THE FAIRNESS ISSUE THAT NOT. ALL AND LIAISE WITH PARTICIPATE IN THE FIRST PROPOSAL WHERE AS THEY WOULD IF WE HAD THIS. BECAUSE ASIAN. BEES -- I THINK FOR THIS PROPOSAL IT IS TARGETED SO LIKE YOU MENTIONED NOT EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT -- I THINK FOR EQUALIZATION GENERALLY AS AS FAR AS I KNOW NOT EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT EITHER RIGHT WHICH IS KIND OF SHIFTING FUNDING -- FROM L. CFF INTO SPECIAL EDUCATION -- AND WHERE WE'RE BRINGING PEOPLE OUT BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BRINGING EVERYONE UP AS WELL AND SO I THINK. THIS FUNDING IS MORE OF AN IT'S IT'S EQUITY FOCUS IT'S WHERE THE HIGH NEED AREAS WHERE THE HIGH NEED STUDENTS LET'S PUT A LOT OF FUNDING INTO THAT -- AND AGAIN EQUALIZATION IS KIND OF A A CONTINUE WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AS MARY VERSION. COMES AT OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR QUESTIONS [inaudible] SEEING NONE. WELL THIS ISSUE OPEN. NEXT ISSUE SCHOOL FACILITIES OKAY PLEASE PROCEED. WITH BUDGET OVER -- LET'S SEE THIS ONE WE ARE FINANCE. THANK YOU CAN IT'S LA -- AND THEN. PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. THANK YOU KEITH NIZAM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS YOU KNOW THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AUTHORIZING THE SALE OF SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN BOND FUNDS TO SUPPORT K. TWELVE SCHOOL FACILITY. PROJECTS -- THREE BILLION DID WAS DESIGNATED FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION THREE BILLION FOR MODERNIZATION AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EACH FOR CREE TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES. IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE STATE'S BURST FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THESE BOND FUNDS -- THE THAT'S MEMBERS EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS FIVE HER NINETY FIVE MILLION -- AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE PROPOSE A GOAL DISBURSING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER UNTIL THE BOND FUNDING IS EXHAUSTED -- TO MEET THE OBJECTIVE OR THE GOAL OF DISBURSING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN BOND FUNDS IN THE BUDGET YEARS -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- PROVIDES THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION WITH TEN POSITIONS AND ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN BOND FUND BOND FUNDING TO INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY TO PROCESS THE DISH APPLICATIONS NECESSARY. TO DISPERSE THE ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN BOND FUNDING -- AS WE KNOW BONDS ARE NOT ARE NOT FREE AND REQUIRE A PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ADVERTISE OVER THIRTY YEAR PERIOD TYPICALLY -- IN -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THE DEBT SERVICE FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE AND THE VARIOUS PREVIOUS OKAY TWELVE FACILITY BONDS -- IS TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND -- UP THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO BE DISPERSED IN NINETEEN TWENTY RESULT IN ANNUALIZED DEBT SERVICE OF EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- PER YEAR FOR A TOTAL OF POSSIBLY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION OVER THAT THIRTY YEAR. REPAYMENT PERIOD -- OF COURSE I STATE BONDS ARE NOT THE ONLY -- FUNDING SOURCE FOR SCHOOLS TO BUILD FACILITY TO MEET THEIR FACILITY NEEDS -- ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEBT AND AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION SINCE TWO THOUSAND TO VOTE LOCAL VOTERS HAVE PASSED -- OVER ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN LOCAL BONDS TO MEET THEIR FACILITY NEEDS IN ADDITION THERE'S ANOTHER ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY'VE BEEN GENERATED THROUGH DEVELOPER FEES. ON A COMMERCIAL RESIDENTIAL. BUILDINGS -- AND THAT CONCLUDES MY OVER. GOOD MORNING AMY LEE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ARE YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A HANDOUT THAT WILL BE REFERENCING THEIR ORDER PRESENTATION THIS MORNING YEP THAT'S IT. I WILL COVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BOND SALE FIRST AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE ASSOCIATED STAFFING PROPOSAL THE STARTING ON PAGE. ONE THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO AS A WAY FOR THE STATE AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SHARE COSTS OF BUILDING NEW SCHOOL FACILITIES AND RENOVATING OLD ONES. THE STATE PROVIDES FUNDING ON A PER PUPIL BASIS AND COVERS IT SHARE USING VOTER APPROVED GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIX VOTERS APPROVED THIRTY FIVE BILLION IN STATE SCHOOL BONDS THIS BOND FUNDING WAS EFFECTIVELY EXHAUSTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND DESTRUCTION COVER THEIR SHARE THROUGH LOCAL BONDS APPROVED BY VOTERS. MOVING ON TO PAGE. TWO SO THIS COVERS AN OVERVIEW OF PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE WHICH FINANCE -- ALREADY SHARED THIS IS THE MOST RECENTLY APPROVED STATE SCHOOL BOND I THINK THE ONLY THING WE WOULD LIKE TO MENTION IS THAT THE STATE HAS MADE TO INSTALL HAVE MADE INSTALLMENTS OF PROPOSITION. FIFTY ONE BOND SALES FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS SELLING UNDER SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR EACH OF THOSE YEARS IF THE STATE WERE TO CONTINUE AT THIS PACE IT WOULD TAKE A TOTAL OF TWELVE YEARS TO EXHAUST PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FINDS. IN THE MEANTIME THE CITY HAS A GROWING BACKLOG OF SCHOOL FACILITY APPLICATIONS WITH ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN APPLICATION STILL AWAITING PROCESSING AS OF THE END OF THIS FEBRUARY. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SELL THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN SCHOOL BONDS IN. NINETEEN TWENTY THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO MORE QUICKLY FIND PROJECTS WAITING IN THE PIPELINE AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVEL OF BOND SALES THE LEGISLATURE DISCUSSED DURING BUDGET HEARINGS LAST YEAR. AT THIS PACE IT WOULD TAKE A TOTAL OF SIX YEARS TOEXHAUST PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FINDS WHICH IS A CELEBRATED COMPARED TO TWELVE YEAR TIMELINE PREVIOUSLY. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE HERE WHAT WE START TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR STAFFING PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSED INCREASE MONTHS OUT. AS YOU CAN SEE AND THE FIGURE ON PAGE FOUR THERE ARE THREE MAIN AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE STATE'S REVIEW PROCESS FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROP PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REVIEW SITE APPROVAL AND PLANS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. THE DIVISION OF THE STATE ARCHITECT REVIEWS PLANTS FOR SAFETY AND ACCESSIBILITY CONCERNS. AND THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION -- PSE PROCESSES SCHOOL FACILITY APPLICATIONS TO DETERMINE FUNDING ELIGIBILITY AND THEN PRESENTS PROJECTS TO THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD FOR APPROVAL. OPSEU CURRENTLY HAS FIFTY TWO AUTHORIZED POSITIONS HALF OF THEM ARE ASSIGNED TO THE AUDIT DIVISION AND THE OTHER HALF ARE SAYING TO THE PROGRAM SERVICES DIVISION. THE PROGRAM SERVICES DIVISION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS HANDLING APPEALS PROGRAM POLICIES AN ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. MOVING ON TO PEACH. FIVE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE ONE POINT TWO MILLION -- FOR PSE TO HIRE TEN ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR APPLICATION PROCESSING THIS WOULD INCLUDE EIGHT ANALYSTS AND TWO MANAGERS THIS WOULD BE AN ON GOING AUGMENTATION FROM POP IT PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FINDS. TWO WEEKS AGO UPON REQUEST FROM BUDGET STAFF OPC PROVIDED ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD INFORMATION WHICH WERE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING. BASED ON INFORMATION THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE IN FEBRUARY THOUGH WHEN WE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS WE HAVE THREE MAIN CONCERNS WITH THE STAFFING PROPOSAL. FIRST WE BELIEVE OPSEU DECADES TO FEW STAFF TO APT TO BUY APPLICATION PROCESSING CURRENTLY ONLY TEN FULL TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE FIFTY TWO AUTHORIZED POSITIONS ARE DEDICATED TO THIS CORE FUNCTION. THIS IS LESS THAN 20% OF ALL POSITIONS. SECONDLY WE HAVE A RELATED CONCERN THAT THE REQUESTED TEN NEW POSITIONS MORE THAN -- PSE MAY NEED USING OPIATES SEES OWN LOGIC AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THAT ORIGINAL STAFFING PROPOSAL WE ESTIMATE THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN APPLICATIONS COULD BE PROCESSED BY. TWELVE EMPLOYEES WHICH IS ONLY TWO MORE THAN OPC CURRENTLY DEDICATES TO THIS FUNCTION. WHEN WE BROUGHT UP THIS DIFFERENCE OPS HE INDICATED TO US THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL WORK ASSOCIATED WITH APPLICATION PROCESSING? INCLUDING. UPDATING ELIGIBILITY FOR PROBE FOR THE PROGRAM AND HANDLING APPEALS THIS ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD WOULD HAVE TO BE RATHER HIGH RELATIVE TO THE CITED TIME SPENT PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. THE POTENTIALLY JUSTIFY TEN NEW POSITIONS. FINALLY WE BELIEVE SOME POSITIONS CAN BE RE DIRECTED TO APPLICATION PROCESSING FROM -- PC'S AUDITING DIVISION. THE PASS OPS HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR AUDITING PROJECTS TO VERIFY THAT THEY COMPLY WITH PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND THE PROJECT PROPOSALS ORIGINALLY APPROVED. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE STATE DEVOLVED THESE ART RESPONSIBILITIES TO LOCAL INDEPENDENT AUDITORS WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING STAFF REDUCTIONS -- TO PSE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT -- PSE HAD SOME WORK ASSOCIATE WITH TRANSITIONING THESE RESPONSIBILITIES AND IS STILL WRAPPING UP SOME PROJECT AUDIENCE. HOWEVER AUDITING IS NO LONGER A CORE FUNCTION OF THIS AGENCY YET TWENTY FOUR POSITIONS ARE ALMOST HALF OF ALL POSITIONS ARE STILL HOUSED IN THE AUDIT DIVISION. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE OPC STAFFING PROPOSAL BECAUSE WE FIND THAT IN PC CAN MANAGE THE NEW WORKLOAD USING EXISTING RESOURCES. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. HI LISA STILL BERMAN I'M GET WITH THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. YEAH I LIKE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ON BY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS FAR AS A STAFFING LEVELS ARE CONCERNED AND WANTED DEFINITELY CLARIFY. THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE CURRENTLY ARE NOT TWENTY FOUR ANA POSITIONS IN THE AGENCY SO. FIRST I I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY SIX WERE OVERSTATED THEY'RE ACTUALLY SIX ANALYST IN THAT AREA -- THAT WERE INITIALLY -- DESIGNATED FOR ASSISTING WITH THE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OF WHAT WE CALL THE K. TWELVE AUDIT SUPPORT. AT THOSE FOLKS ARE ACTUALLY PROCESSING APPLICATIONS AND THEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SEVEN EQUIVALENT MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS AN ACT. AREA WE HAD ELEVEN DESIGNATED AUDITOR'S. THAT WOULD INITIALLY ASSIGNED TO THAT AREA WE HAVE TWO VACANCIES -- WONDERS VACANCIES ARE CONVERTED TO AN ACCOUNTING OFFICER VACANCY AND ACTUALLY WILL BE FILLED -- PROBABLY WITH THE NEXT TWO DAYS. DUE TO THE IMPENDING WORKLOAD -- AND THEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE AUDITOR ON A LIMITED TERM ASSIGNMENT -- IN OUR ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY M. AREA SO WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT VACANCY POSED A VACANT -- FOR THE NEXT I WOULD BELIEVE IT'S SIDE TWENTY TWENTY SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY SO WE CAN'T FILL THAT VACANCY AT THIS POINT THEM UNLESS AT CANDID IT IS SUCCESSFUL WITH THE TRANSITION -- AND THAT CLASSIFICATION SO AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE THEM THAT PICKED POSITION OPEN AT THIS POINT TIME. SO I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT OUR ROLE IS -- YES THEREIS FIFTY TWO STAFF POSITIONS IN OUR AREA AND IF WE WERE JUST PROCESS THE NEW CONSTRUCTION MODERNIZATION -- FRANCE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MUCH EXPANDED ROLE WE ACTUALLY HAVE CAREER TECH. RAM GRANTS AS WELL -- THERE IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AUTHORIZED -- AS PART OF PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE SO WE STILL HAVE A OPEN FINALLY AROUND AND WE STILL HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE ACTUALLY WILL BE PROCESSING -- TO THE MAY BOARD TO ACTUALLY TAKE STAFF ALLOCATION AND HOURS TO PROCESS THOSE AT THE PROGRAM GRANTS WE STILL HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- IN FUTURE FUNDING TO ALLOCATE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL AND THAT TAKES STAFFING TIME -- AS WELL AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF HILLS I WOULD SAY -- ON AVERAGE TWO TO THREE APPEALS GO TO THE BOARD EVERY MONTH OTHERS ALSO APPEALS TO GET RESOLVED MINISTRY TO FLEE -- THERE'S A NUMBER REGULATIONS THAT WE BRING FORWARD TO THE BOARD I WOULD SAY THREE TO FOUR ON AVERAGE EVERY YEAR -- BUT ALSO -- TAKES ABOUT TIME AND EFFORT -- THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND AGREEMENTS HAVE ALSO PROCESS TO THE BOARD -- THAT WAS ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT WASN'T ANTICIPATED DONE THE BOARDED UP TO GRANT AGREEMENT WHICH IS GREAT. PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE PROGRAM BUT AGAIN THAT'S ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT -- WE ARE STAFFING THEM -- TO AND AGAIN THAT'S ADDITIONAL WORK BUT THEY WERE PROCESSING AS WELL. THERE'S CHARTER PROJECTS THAT ARE CONVERTING -- SO WANT TO KNOWLEDGE THAT -- SO THERE'S WEBSITE -- PUBLICATIONS THOSE AT A PUBLICATIONS THAT AS WELL THERE'S BUSINESS SERVICES IS MAIL ROOM THERE'S ACCOUNTING STAFF AGAIN I JUST WANT THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS THAT WE DO SO. JUST TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE -- JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU AS FAR AS THE AUDITS CONCERN WE STILL HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN CLOSE OUT ON ITS THAT ARE. AGAIN OUR STE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES ARE PROJECTS THAT WERE FUNDED PRIOR TO APRIL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALTHOUGH I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- THE CLOTHES OUT FUNCTIONS DID SHIFT -- TO THE LOCAL WATERS -- THERE ARE PRIOR PRIOR PROJECTS AGAIN THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO AUDIT THOSE PROJECTS. AND THAT THAT IS THE BURDEN OF OUR STAFF -- WE HAVE THAT NINE AUDITOR'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WORKLOAD. AND ALSO WE ACTUALLY HAVE -- AS FAR AS SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS CHECKS WE HAVE THE CASE TWELVE AUDIT SUPPORT. AND AGAIN -- WITH THE NEW PROGRAM WE ACTUALLY AGAIN HAVE TO EDUCATE AND TRAIN. THE LA ETS AND THE CPA'S -- OUT THERE ON THE NEW HONOR REQUIREMENTS -- THAT JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN ALL BY ITSELF -- DISTRICTS WANT TO KNOW WHAT -- WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE AND HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE NEW PROGRAM SO AGAIN THAT TAKES A A LOT OF EFFORT AND TIME? AND THEY ALSO WANT TO HAVE A SOFT REVIEW OF THEIR EXPENDITURE REPORTS AND AGAIN TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET IN A AND ARE ON IT -- WE HAVE AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR PLUS SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS JACKSON AGAIN THE LOCAL WATERS DIDN'T WANT ASSUME THAT RESPONSIBILITY SINCE WE ARE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. ANY ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES MOVING FORWARD IN THE K. TWELVE BODY GUY WILL BE -- OUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL -- I ALSO WANT TO SHARE -- ADDITIONAL COMPONENT AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF APPLICATION PROCESS SAY IN. THIS DISTRICTS THAT ARE SEEKING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP ASSISTANCE AND THAT ALSO IS A ALSO RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUDIT STAFF SO WHAT DOES THAT ENTAIL THAT IS -- FRONT IN REVIEW TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF THE DISTRICTS OR THE L. A.'S HAVE. FUNDS AVAILABLE AND SO THAT DETERMINATION GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THE GRANT PROCESSING SO IF THERE'S ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF GRANT PROCESSING IN THE FRONT END. THERE'S FORTY THREE DISTRICTS WITHIN THAT GROUP BEING THAT WILL SEEK -- STATE ASSISTANCE FOR THE MATCH AND THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT THE ON IT STAFF. SO I WANTTO SHARE THAT WITH YOU -- ANOTHER COMPOUND IT IS FAR AS OUR STAFFING NEEDS -- AS FAR AS REQUESTING TEN ADDITIONAL STAFF -- THAT WE HAVE -- ADDED VALUE TO WHAT WE DO I'M IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT OF WHY WE NEED TO HAVE OUR STAFF ADDITIONAL STAFF TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS. OUT OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE PROCESS A HUNDRED EIGHTIES APPLICATIONS AN OUT OF THE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN APPLICATIONS. FORTY NINE RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL GRANTS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO ELLIE ETS WHICH IS GREAT NEWS -- SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL GRANTS WERE AWARDED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BUT I ALSO WANT TO SHARE A HUNDRED AND TWELVE PROJECTS RESULTED IN A NET REDUCTION. IN THEIR GRANTS SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SOME OF THE GRANTS THEY WERE ENTITLED. TO AND THAT RESULTED IN A HUNDRED AND HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN A REDUCTION IN THE PROJECT REQUEST. SO THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SO AGAIN WE ADD VALUE AND AGAIN. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PROJECTS OF THE GRANTS THAT WE ALLOWED IN OUR PROGRAM. AGAIN OUR ALLEYS ARE ENTITLED TO SO AGAIN WE HAVE SAFEGUARDS IN OUR PROGRAM AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROCESSING GRANTS THAT DISTRICTS ARE ENTITLED. TO THERE TWENTY SIX GRANTS ARE PROCESS AS WELL THAT DIDN'T REQUIRE ANY CHANGE AT ALL SO AGAIN EIGHTY SIX POINT -- ONE OF THE REVIEWS DID REQUIRE SOME NET RESULT CHANGE SO AGAIN I WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU. OKAY WE'LL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL. I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM -- SO THAT THAT CONCLUDES THE THE FIVE ISSUE ITEMS FOR TODAY. NO ACTION ITEMS WILL PROCEED NOW WITH PUBLIC COM [inaudible] YEAH OKAY PLEASE PROCEED GOOD MORNING I'M CHARLEY HOFFMAN. BY THE WAY GET SORRY. ONE MINUTE OR LESS THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU.

MISTER CHAIR NANCY TRIED AS A SPIN OFF ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING CASH AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE K. TWELVE FACILITIES PORTION OF YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY. I'LL BEGIN WITH THE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS -- IT'S CLEAR THAT THE INFORMATION IS STILL IN FLUX AND THAT THE COMMITTEE IS RECEIVING NEW INFORMATION WE SURE APPRECIATE THE THE INCREASE TRANSPARENCY THAT WE'RE SEEING -- CACHES POSITION IS -- PARTLY IN AGREEMENT WITH THE PROPOSAL WE DO SUPPORT THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S ONE POINT. FIVE MILLION AUGMENTATION FOR THE IT TEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THAT -- PSE -- AT THE SAME TIME WE DO AGREE WITH LA IS ANALYSIS THAT -- THE OVERALL ALLOCATION OF STAFFING DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE IN LINE WITH THE CORE FUNCTION OF OPSEC AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS THE ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE. MOVES FORWARD THAT WE LOOK FOR OTHER WAYS TO WORK WITH AN EXISTING RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE CAN WE DO MORE SHIFTING OF POSITIONS NOT JUST WITH NO PST BUT WITHIN THE GREATER DEPARTMENT. GENERAL SERVICES -- AND YOU KNOW WE WE JUST HEARD SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM -- OPSEC FROM A SILVERMAN FOR EXAMPLE -- WITH EACH WHICH TELLS US IF IN FACT THERE ARE MORE POSITIONS PROCESSING APPLICATIONS THAT THAT JUST MAKES US THINK THE PRODUCTIVITY REALLY SHOULD BE BETTER THAN WHAT IT IS -- OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL OUTPUT HISTORICAL APPORTIONMENT OF PROP FIFTY OF EXCUSE ME OF S. OF P. APPLICATIONSSO WE DO SUPPORT -- THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN -- BOND SALES AND CORRESPONDING APPORTIONMENT BUT FRANKLY WE THINK THAT -- THE STATE CAN DO EVEN BETTER THAN THAT -- THE BACKLOG OF COURSE IS APPROACHING FIVE BILLION -- IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS COUPLE OF DECADES THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN -- ASKING OUR EDUCATORS TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY DO THEIR JOB SO TEACHERS ARE NOW REQUIRED TO TEACH IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND STUDENTS NEED ADEQUATE FACILITIES TO DO THAT TO TEACH COMMON CORE. NDSS YES SIR.
