WE END UP WITH A SILENT SOLUTION

00:50:57.721 --> 00:51:00.157
THAT THEN REQUIRES REDEVELOPMENT

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:02.192
ADDITIONAL DOLLARS AND JUST

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:04.628
DOESN'T LET US SHARE THE DATA

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.229

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:09.466
LIKE AN INDIRECT. IMPACT AT THE

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:50.239
KEY TOWARD KNOWING HOW TO FIX IT

AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE LEVEL

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:02.985

MOMENT- ON THAT POINT BUT I

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.507
THINK TWO OF THE THINGS THAT

WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SYSTEM

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:15.110
WIDE RALLY JUMP TO MIND HERE-

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:17.313
THAT THE OF FIRST OF ALL- THE

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:19.181

MEASURES IS ANOTHER ONE. THESE

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:28.724
EFFORTS REQUIRE AN IMMENSE

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:30.326
AMOUNT OF DATA STRATIFIED IN A

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.127
WAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT HERE TO

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.498
THAT'S MORE THAT'S MORE REAL AND

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:38.434
WALL YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE WORD

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:48.043
DIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF THIS

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:50.613

GILLETTE IF I CAN I'M HOPING FOR

01:50:13.406 --> 01:50:15.308
A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON

01:50:15.375 --> 01:50:18.011
THE THEFT PHENOMENON WHICH WE

01:50:18.078 --> 01:50:20.246
ARE EXPERIENCING. AS WELL A HOW

01:50:20.313 --> 01:50:22.082
THE RESOURCES IN THE P. C. P.

01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:24.784
WILL BE SET UP TO XXL FULLY

01:50:24.851 --> 01:50:27.721
BATTLE THIS SITE- NOTICED THAT

01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:31.358
THE PROPOSAL IS FOR LESS THAN WE

01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:34.661
ARE- LOSING WITHIN A GIVEN

01:50:34.728 --> 01:50:37.530
MONTH. AS A COST FOR THE ENTIRE

01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:40.333
YEAR WONDERING IF WE'RE AT THE

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.769
RIGHT CARE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:50:42.836 --> 01:50:45.372
ARE COMBATING THIS EFFECTIVELY.

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:47.974
YEAH SO GREAT QUESTION- WE HAVE

01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:50.310
SEEN AN INCREASE AND WE IN FACT

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:52.412
THAT AS I MENTIONED- WE ARE

01:50:52.479 --> 01:50:54.381
STILL TRYING TO INVESTIGATE

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:56.182
EXACTLY. WHY THIS IS HAPPENING-

01:50:56.249 --> 01:50:58.251
YEAH WE HAVE SOME THEORIES BUT-

01:50:58.318 --> 01:50:59.486
INVESTIGATES AND INVESTIGATIONS

01:50:59.552 --> 01:51:01.521
ARE ONGOING SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:03.356
HARD TO SAY AT THIS POINT. OUR

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:04.791
BEST GUESS IS THAT IN THE PAST

01:51:04.858 --> 01:51:07.060
IS THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BEEN

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:08.261
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN PURSUED

01:51:08.328 --> 01:51:10.363
BY. INDIVIDUAL ACTORS- AND-

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:11.931
THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE NOW THAT

01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:14.267
THERE MIGHT BE. ORGANIZED IT'S A

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:15.769
LITTLE BIT MORE ORGANIZATION

01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:16.703
IT'S HAPPENING BEHIND IT WITH

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.505
NO. PRIME BRAKES THAT ARE

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:19.572
THEY'RE GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:21.908
WORK. WE ARE PURSUING A NUMBER

01:51:21.975 --> 01:51:24.044
STRATEGIES TO COMBAT UP ON THE

01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:26.746
FRONT END- SO FOR EXAMPLE WERE

01:51:26.813 --> 01:51:29.349
PLANNING TO ROLL OUT A NEW CARD

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:31.184
VERIFICATION VALUE CVT

01:51:31.251 --> 01:51:34.587
TECHNOLOGY- ON EBT CARDS- NEXT

01:51:34.654 --> 01:51:35.922
MONTH WHICH SHOULD. BOTH BE

01:51:35.989 --> 01:51:37.957
SUBSTANTIALLY DOWN ON THE- SIDE

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:40.627
OF THINGS- AND WE'RE ALSO

01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:42.295
THINKING ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:43.730
USE. THAT DATA THAT WE HAV ON

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.632
CARD USAGE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:48.168
WHERE SOME OF THOSE SKIMMING

01:51:48.234 --> 01:51:49.069
DEVICES MAYBE. AND ALSO GLEANING

01:51:49.135 --> 01:51:50.603
INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED

01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:52.572
FOR INVESTIGATORS TO GO OUT AND

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:55.241
PURSUE THOSE LEADS AND TRY TO

01:51:55.308 --> 01:51:56.443
TRACK DOWN SOME OF THE-

01:51:56.509 --> 01:51:59.279
PERPETRATORS OF THESE CRIMES-

01:51:59.345 --> 01:52:00.613
THESE RESOURCES WILL BE

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:02.382
SUBSTANTIALLY BENEFICIAL.

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:07.220
BECAUSE CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:14.994
A LOT OF RESOURCES ON THE STATE. SIDE PURSUE WORK BEST IT.

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:16.796
RUSTICATED STOP I'M TO GO AND

01:52:16.863 --> 01:52:17.597
CONDUCT THOSE THOSE-

01:52:17.664 --> 01:52:18.531
INVESTIGATIONS WHERE WHERE THE

01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:20.500
TOPIC. AND SO THIS IS BECOMING

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:22.435
MORE THAT IT IS THE STATE ISSUE

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:24.871
IT CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF

01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:25.805
THERE ARE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:28.141
THAT- YOU KNOW SOMEONE HAS THEIR

01:52:28.208 --> 01:52:29.576
BENEFITS AS SOMEONE WHO IS A

01:52:29.642 --> 01:52:31.611
CARD HOLDER AND I LOS ANGELES

01:52:31.678 --> 01:52:33.680
HAS THEIR BENEFITS STOLEN BUT

01:52:33.746 --> 01:52:37.984
THEN DRAWN DOWN FROM AN ACCOUNT

01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:41.287
. BAY AREA- SO. WHAT WE WOULD

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:42.322
EXPECT IS THAT WOULD BE

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:43.723
SITUATIONAL DEDICATED STATE

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:46.392
RESOURCES WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:48.595
PURSUE MORE OF THOSE LEADS

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:51.464
IDENTIFY A MORE- ABOUT MALICIOUS

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:54.000
ACTORS AND HOPEFULLY GET SOME

01:52:54.067 --> 01:52:56.302
ARRESTS THAT WOULD CUT DOWN ON

01:52:56.369 --> 01:52:58.471
ON FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:52:58.538 --> 01:53:01.541
I'M- I DO WANT TO DIG IN A

01:53:01.608 --> 01:53:04.043
LITTLE BIT AS I WANT TO MAKE

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:04.744
SURE THAT WE ARE STRENGTHENING

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:06.746
THE PROGRAM WHEN WE HAVE THIS

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:10.583
THEFT OCCURRING- WE ARE THEN NOT

01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:12.519
HAVING CALFRESH DOLLARS GOING

01:53:12.585 --> 01:53:14.053
TOWARDS THEIR DESIGNATED.

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:16.389
PURPOSE OF ADDRESSING FOOD

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:19.225
INSECURITY AND SO I THINK THE

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:21.394
REASON OR RATIONALE FOR MY

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:22.729
QUESTIONING IS REALLY TO MAKE

01:53:22.795 --> 01:53:24.831

01:53:24.898 --> 01:53:30.103
RESOURCES TO. PURSUE ENOUGH TO

CURTAIL THE SENATE THIS IN THE

01:53:31.471 --> 01:53:33.306
BUD AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M

01:53:33.373 --> 01:53:35.041
ASKING OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:38.144
IN LIGHT OF. US HAVING

01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:40.780
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. IS THIS

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:42.148
THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF

01:53:42.215 --> 01:53:44.984
RESOURCES FOR US TO STOP THIS

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:47.520
AND NIP THIS IN THE BUD OR WILL

01:53:47.587 --> 01:53:50.690
YOU. NEED MORE IN THE FUTURE I

01:53:50.757 --> 01:53:52.592
WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT HONEST.

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:54.327
CONVERSATION TODAY TO MAKE SURE

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:56.996
THAT WE'RE PROVIDING- THE

01:53:57.063 --> 01:53:58.965
APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

01:53:59.032 --> 01:54:00.700
TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM HEAD ON.

01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:02.202
COMMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

SO. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ARE

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:16.649

BE. SUFFICIENT FOR THE ISLAND IS

01:54:36.803 --> 01:54:38.671
THAT WE'VE SEEN- BUT WOULD ALSO

01:54:38.738 --> 01:54:39.939
ADD THAT WE ARE PURSUING

01:54:40.006 --> 01:54:41.207
