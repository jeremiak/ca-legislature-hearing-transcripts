TO OUR JOINT OVERSIGHT HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON CYBERSECURITY TODAY SO HEARING IS THREE A TRIFOLD IN FACT FIRST IT IS TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC TO HEAR FROM THE STATE AUDITOR ON A RECENT REPORT ON THE STATUS OF THOSE STATES INFORMATION SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY READINESS SECOND IT IS TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH LEADS TO STAY IN ITS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ANYMORE. AW UNIFY FASHION ON THE AUDIT FINDINGS AND INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS THIRD IT IS TO ALLOW AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS I ALSO WANNA THANK ALL MY A CO CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR A WIN FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON CYBERSECURITY SHOES. AND AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CYBERSECURITY THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SHE HAS BEEN A GREAT CHAMPION AND RESOLUTE DOUBT PARTNER IN A SHORT EFFORT TO FIND A SOLUTION. TO THE ISSUE OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY CAPS I ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT. LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR HIS PARTICIPATION HERE TODAY I AS CHAIR OF J. LACK AND FELLOW MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CYBERSECURITY I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE HIS RECORD OF SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE OUR PRIOR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I ALSO LIKE THE ALSO THINK THE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY MISTER OBERNOLTE AND ALSO A MISTER KILEY. ON THE ISSUE OF STATE INFORMATION SECURITY AND GAPS IN OVERSIGHT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST TO US FOR SOMETIME NOW IN FACT SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I INTRODUCED A BILL. AB THIRTY. ONE NINETY THREE THAT WAS JOIN THE AUTHORED BY CHAIR. WOMEN IRWIN AND ALL FELLOW ON. MEMBER OF A FROM A PRICE COMMITTEE MISTER OBERNOLTE ON THIS VERY EXACT ISSUES SPECIFICALLY THE BILL SOUGHT TO REQUIRE ALL AGENCIES. AND NOT ONLY DOES UNDER DIRECT AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNOR TO COMPLY WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION SECURITY OR I. S. WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS C. T. T. UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL WAS OPPOSED BY. CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS WHO SOUGHT TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT FROM ANY A BURDENS OF RESPONSIBILITY FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE WHICH DID NOT ALIGN WITH THEIR- OF PRIORITIES. NOW THE AUDITOR'S RECENT REPORT COMPLETELY VALIDATES THE X. CONCERNS ON THAT THE- MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE HAD. AND SHOWS THAT MANY OF THE ENTITIES THAT DO NOT REPORT TO THE CDT HAVE INDEED HIGH RISKS DEFICIENCIES AND MANY ARE UNAWARE. OF INFORMATION SECURITY WEAKNESSES AT ALL. OUT IN MY OPENING REMARKS BY ADMITTING THAT THIS MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE THE MOST THRILLING TOPIC ON PAPER. BUT EVERY TIME WE HAVE A BREACH AND DATA BE IT ON THE PRIVATE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE TARGET EQUIFAX FACEBOOK OVER OTHERS. OR THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STATE SIDE OF THE PUBLIC IS RIGHTFULLY FRIGHTENED AND WE FIND OURSELVES DEALING WITH. THE AFTERMATH OFTENTIMES. IF WE WANT TO CHANCE AT REDUCING THESE EVENTS ON THE STATE SIDE WE HAVE TO. FOCUS UP AND BE MORE PROACTIVE RATHER THAN REACTIONARY I BELIEVE A STARTING WITH HEARINGS LIKE THE ONE THAT WE HAVING A TODAY. I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND HOPE THAT WITH THE FINDINGS OF THE RECENT REPORT OUR LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO BRING ALL STAY ENTITIES ON THE ONE UNIFORM IF NATION'S SECURITY APPROACH. WILL FINALLY MAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK SO WITH .ORG I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO CHAIR WOMEN IRWIN. FOR ON HER OPENING REMARKS. AT THIS TIME SINCE ITS INCEPTION. I'VE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH MY COLLEAGUES BOTH IN LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THE THREATS THAT ARE FACING US AND ARE APPROPRIATELY PREPARED TO FACE THEM. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE STATE AUDITOR. I RELEASED HER FIRST REPORT WHICH IDENTIFIED INFORMATION SECURITY AS A HIGH RISK AREA FOR OUR STATE. WITH A FOCUS ON BUILDING UP OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NETWORKS THE MANDATING BETTER TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO USE OUR REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE HAD TIME TO BUILD AN IMPORTANT FOUNDATION OF SECURITY. THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD ON. THE REPORT WE ARE HERE FOR TODAY IS. TO BRING INTO FOCUS A PROBLEM THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SEAT AND OF FOR SEVERAL YEARS SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT THOSE NON REPORTING AGENT ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ARE BLIND SPOT. THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE OVERSIGHT THAT RESULTED IN IMPORTANT OUTCOMES FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. WELL IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY SINCERE HOPE THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES. OF REPRESENTATIONS OF MANY OF THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES WERE TRUE THAT THEY WERE MEETING EVERY STANDARD AND THAT THEY WERE KEEPING OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECURE THIS REPORT. CONFIRMS THAT THOSE HOPES WERE SOMEWHAT MISPLACED WITH TODAY'S HEARING I'M READY TO DIG INTO THE DETAILS WITH THE AUDITOR AND HER TEAM. AND TO GET CONTACTS AN EXPERT KNOWLEDGE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CONCRETE STEPS TO LEVERAGE THE FULL FORCE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN SOLVING THE LACK OF FOCUS ON CYBERSECURITY AND NON REPORTING ENTITIES. AND NOW I WOULD LIKE TO. TURN THE GAVEL OVER SORT OF. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS. THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAU ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN FOR HAVING ME HERE AS WELL. I DO THINK THIS IS A VERY EXCITING TOPIC IS A VERY EXCITING TOPIC ESPECIALLY FOR NOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD TODAY. YOU KNOW WE CAN READ WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH A AYE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HOW THAT'S BEING INTEGRATED WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION. SOFTWARE WE CAN READ WE READ ABOUT WHAT BIG BIG DATA ACTUALLY MEANS THE WEATHER WHERE WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT ANALYTICA OR EVEN THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE OR TO OUR OWN SHOPPING HABITS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE I TALK TO THEY FEEL LIKE THEIR PHONE SPYING ON THEM BECAUSE- EVERY TIME THEY GO TO LOOK AT AN ARTICLE THEY SEE SOMETHING THAT THEY JUST SHOP FOR. RIGHT REMINDING THEM TO. TO PURCHASE WHATEVER ITEM THEY WERE JUST LOOKING AT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT THAT REMINDS US SO IS AB HOW MUCH TECHNOLOGY IS INVOLVED IN. AND US THE STATE LAWMAKERS NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SYSTEMS HERE AT THE STATE OR ACTUALLY ADEQUATELY OF ALL THE AT THAT PACE IF NOT I KNOW WE'RE IN A PERPETUAL CATCH UP STATE. WITH THAT AND SO OUR POLICIES AND SOME OF THE LEGISLATION I KNOW EACH OF US OF INTRODUCED AND CO AUTHOR TOGETHER. TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE POLICY THINGS I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO. THE AUDITORS WERE REPORTED HER RECOMMENDATIONS AS SHE OUTLINED AS WELL FOR WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE IN COMPLIANCE OR WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE BECAUSE I KNOW FOR A- OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR DAY JUST PROTECTED. RIGHT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY INFORMATION THAT THE HAND OVER TO THE STATE IS PROTECTED IN ISN'T. MISUSED OUR ARE USED IN THE NEFARIOUS WAY AND SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I KNOW WE'RE IN A- MARATHON OF HEARINGS THIS WEEK INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS IN A WEEK. YOUR FIRST IN REALLY LAST NIGHT. THAT TODAY AND I KNOW TOMORROW YOU'LL BE WIT ME AGAIN. SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS. CALLING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING DOLLAR THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AND BEFORE I INTRODUCED THE FIRST PANEL WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS HERE FROM OUR PRIVACY COMMITTEE WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT. OPENING REMARKS. MR KILEY NOW YOU ARE THE TRUSTED IN THAT. ALL RIGHT. SO FOR THE PRESENTATION OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO CALL UP ELAINE HELL'S THE STATE AUDITOR AND THEN ALSO FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE BEN WARD WHO IS AN AUDITOR SUPERVISOR. WELCOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR CHAO AND CHAIR WHEN MEMBERS OF THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOW ALL ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR TO MY RIGHT IS BEEN WARD BAN IS THE AUDIT MANAGER OF OUR I. T. AUDIT SUPPORT GROUP THIS GROUP PROVIDE SUPPORT TO ALL OF THE AUDIT TEAMS THAT WORK ON A VARIETY OF ITEMS THAT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE ASKS US OR DIRECTS US TO CONDUCT BUT ALSO THEY DO SPECIAL WORK FOR US AS WELL AUDIT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE VALUE THAT. THAT MY I. T. ON A GROUP BRINGS TO THE TABLE WHAT I INTEND TO DO VERY QUICKLY IS GO OVER A LITTLE BIT OF THE HISTORY OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S WORK WITH RESPECT TO INFORMATION SECURITY AND THEN I WILL QUICKLY HANDED OVER TO MR WARD AND HE WILL STEP YOU THROUGH THE CONCLUSIONS THAT WE REACHED IN THE MOST RECENT REPORT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE REPORTS THE SERGEANT WILL BE HANDING OUT TO MEMBERS BUT AS AS CHAIR OR WHEN INDICATED MY OFFICE HAS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WE HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY. TO CREATE WHAT'S CALLED A HIGH RISK LIST FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS STATE AGENCIES OR PARTICULAR ISSUE AREAS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS GRAPPLED WITH AND CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH IT SECURITY IT PROCUREMENT ARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE PAST. WHAT THAT. STATUTORY AUTHORITY ALLOWS US TO DO IS USE OUR WORK THAT WE'VE DONE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE WORK THAT OTHER ENTITIES HAVE DONE PERHAPS WORK THAT LA HAS DONE. AND REALLY LOOK AT THESE ISSUES AND TRY TO. LOOK AT THINGS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME RATHER THAN ONE PARTICULAR STANDALONE AUDIT AND THEN WE'RE DONE. SO IN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY THIRTEEN WEEK WAS THE FIRST. POINT IN TIME WHERE WE IDENTIFIED IT SECURITY AS A HIGH RISK ISSUE. THIS WAS BASED ON AUDIT WORK THAT WE HAD DONE ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS THE LEGISLATURE ASKED US TO DO. BUT AGAIN IT WAS SPOTTY IT WAS AN AUDIT OF THE P. YOU SEE IT WAS AN AUDIT OF THE AT THAT TIME THE A OC. AND ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THOSE AUDITS WAS LOOKING AT PROTECTION OF DATA AND I. T. SECURITY. SO WE DECIDED BASED ON AN ADVICE FROM MY STAFF. LET'S LOOK AT THIS MORE GLOBALLY FROM A MORE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE AS TO WHAT IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOING. ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL OUR STATE AGENCIES. TO ENSURE THAT. DATA IS BEING PROTECTED TO THE EXTENT WE POSSIBLY CAN PROTECT IT SO. WE PUT IT ON THE HIGH RISK LIST IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY THIRTEEN. THEN WE DID AN AUDIT IN ALL AT THAT WE RELEASED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND THIS WAS SPECIFICALLY AN AUDIT OF ENTITIES THAT WERE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PURVIEW. UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES PURVIEW AS FAR AS AN AND OVERSIGHT ENTITY. AND IN THAT AUDIT WE SURVEYED AGENCIES AND THEN WE DID A DRILL DOWN AT FIVE PARTICULAR ENTITIES WE DON'T DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE ENTITIES IN THE REPORT. BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND YOU'LL SEE IN THE REPORT. THAT YOU LOOK AT TODAY WERE NOT DISCLOSING THE NAMES OF THE ENTITIES TO PROTECT. BECAUSE THERE ARE VULNERABILITIES IN THERE ARE WEAKNESSES AND WE DON'T WANT TO DISCLOSE THAT. TO THE PUBLIC OR ANYONE THAT WANTS TO POTENTIALLY HACK INTO THE SYSTEMS. SO BACK IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FIFTEEN WE CONDUCTED THE WORK WE SURVEYED A BUNCH OF AGENCIES ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR POLICIES PROCEDURES WHAT STANDARDS DO THEY FOLLOW. WITH RESPECT TO PERFECT. PROTECTING. A DATA AND CALIFORNIA WERE THEY FOLLOWING. OTHER SAM FIFTY THREE HUNDRED STANDARDS WHICH ARE STANDARDS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHED. THAT MIRROR NATIONAL STANDARDS. THAT REALLY DO PUT TOGETHER A FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING DATA WHAT WE FOUND IN THAT AUDIT IS. SEVENTY SEVEN OF THE AGENCIES I THINK WE SURVEYED A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED AGENCY SAID. A SEVENTY THREE OUT OF SEVENTY SEVEN SAID WE ARE NOT COMPLIANT WE KNOW WE SELL FOR SIR WE ARE NOT COMPLIANT. WITH THERE ARE WEAKNESSES IN OUR SYSTEMS. SO WHEN WE WENT TO THE FIVE ENTITIES AND DRILL DOWN. AND REALLY TOOK A HARDER LOOK AT WELL WHY ARE YOU NOT COMPLIANT WILL PART OF THE REASON IS. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE STANDARDS WE NEED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE WE NEED SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. CALIFORNIA'S EXPERTS ARE IN WHAT THE STANDARDS ARE AND WHAT KINDS OF PROTECTIONS. THEY NEEDED ASSISTANCE IN CONDUCTING RISK MANAGEMENT DETERMINING WHAT ARE THE HIGHEST RISK. ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS FIRST SO THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED ALSO. THERE IS REPORTING. THAT STATE ENTITY SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT WE SAW IS EVEN THOUGH THOSE AGENCIES WERE SELF ASSERTING TO TECHNOLOGY. THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM THERE WASN'T FOLLOW UP ON ON THE PART OF TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE THAT IS AGENCIES. EITHER GOT THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING UNDERSTOOD THE GUIDANCE AND REALLY PUT TOGETHER WHAT WAS REFERRED TO AS A REMEDIATION PLAN WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO ADDRESS. THE WEAKNESSES SO WE MADE A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO. ON THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND CERTAINLY SOME LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS AND I KNOW. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHEN WE HAD AUTHORED A BILL AT THAT TIME AND THAT BILL. MADE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND THAT WAS A BILL THAT REQUIRED AGENCIES THIRTY FIVE A YEAR. TO HAVE A SECURITY ASSESSMENT THAT WAS A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AS FAR AS MANDATING. THIS KIND OF ASSESSMENT AND OVERSIGHT FOR AGENCIES TO REALLY PURSUE IT BECAUSE WE SAW A MIX OF. AGENCIES IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE GOING TO DO AN ASSESSMENT HOW COMPREHENSIVE WAS THE ASSESSMENT. SO THERE. HAVE BEEN STEPS AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN INDICATED. THAT THERE HAS BEEN IMPROVEMENT AND LOOKING AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. THEY HAVE FULLY IMPLEMENTED ALL THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDING GUIDANCE HAVING WORKSHOPS LOOKING AT THE STANDARDS GETTING FEEDBACK FROM. THEIR CONSTITUENTS STATE AGENCIES SO WE SAW IMPROVEMENT AT THERE STILL IS WORK TO BE DONE. BUT IT HAS GOTTEN BETTER SO OUR CONCLUSION FROM THAT IS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE HAS HELPED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GET INTO A BETTER POSITION AND PROTECTING DATA BUT THERE WAS A MISSING LINK. IT WAS THESE ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH UNDER THE GOVERNOR. AND MANY OF THOSE ENTITIES WE MEANT WE DON'T SPECIFY BUT IT'S DO YOU JUDICIAL BRANCH ENTITIES CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PURVIEW SO WE DECIDED THIS LAST YEAR WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE AGENCIES AND DO SOMETHING COMPARABLE. TO WHAT WE DID BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO REALLY SEE WHAT IS THE FRAMEWORK LOOKING LIKE WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES DOING CONSTITUTIONAL THAN OTHERS. AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THEY ADOPT STANDARDS THEY'RE FOLLOWING THOSE STANDARDS THEY'RE GETTING THOSE ASSESSMENTS DONE THEY'RE IDENTIFYING THEIR WEAKNESSES. AND HOPEFULLY MITIGATING AND CAR ARE CORRECTING THOSE WEAKNESS WEAKNESSES TO TIGHTEN UP. THE CONTROLS OVER THOSE THE DATA THAT THEY HAVE. IN HOUSE SO WITH THAT MEMBERS ALTERNATE OVER TO MISTER WARD WE HAVE HANDED OUT THE REPORTS VERY SHORT. THERE'S A FEW TABLES IN THE REPORT I BELIEVE MISTER WHAT'S GONNA STEP YOU THROUGH TO REALLY ILLUSTRATE WHAT WE IDENTIFIED THIS PARTICULAR REPORT. VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE IDENTIFIED BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR STATE AGENCIES WE DO HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTEMPLATE. WHERE WE THINK THERE CAN BE REPORTING. TO THE- PRIVACY COMMITTEE AS FAR AS THE ASSESSMENTS THAT THESE ENTITIES ARE DOING SO THAT THERE IS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IT PROTECTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTION. ELS ADDRESSES THAT CONCERN BUT ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT FOR THESE ENTITIES SO THAT WE CAN STRENGTHEN THEIR CONTROLS OVER INFORMATIONS INFORMATION AND DATA THAT THEY COLLECT SO OFTEN I'LL HAND IT OVER TO MISTER WARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS BEN WARD I WAS THE AUDIT PRINCIPLE ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. AND AS MS HOUSE SAID THIS AUDIT FOCUSED ON ENTITIES THAT WERE OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE AUDIT. WE CALL THOSE NON REPORTING ENTITIES AND AMONG OTHER THINGS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THEY DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE- STATE STANDARDS FOR INFORMATION SECURITY THERE ARE MAINTAINED BY DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. SO AGAIN UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT STANDARDS THEY WERE FOLLOWING AND WHAT STEPS THE NON REPORTING AGENCIES WERE TAKING TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAD EFFECTIVE. I'M SECURITY PRACTICES WE SURVEYED THIRTY THREE ENTITIES. AND TWENTY NINE RESPONDED SAYING THAT THEY HAD BASED THEIR SECURITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OFF OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND THAT THEY HAD ALSO DONE AN ASSESSMENT MEASURING THEMSELVES AGAINST THOSE STANDARDS. AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN OF THE REPORT. YOU CAN SEE THAT TWENTY FOUR OF THOSE ENTITIES RESPONDED THAT THEY WERE ONLY PARTIALLY COMPLIANCE. WITH THE STANDARDS AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF SOME OF THE AREASOF NON COMPLIANCE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE FOUND DURING ASSESSMENTS WE HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE EXAMPLES IN THE REPORT ONE ENTITY FOR EXAMPLE. DIDN'T CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORDS ON CERTAIN I. T. DEVICES WHICH- RAISES THE REST THAT SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS THE FALL PASSWORDS CAN INTERPRET REAL ACCESS THOSE DEVICES ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE HIGHLIGHT IN THE REPORT IS AN ENTITY WASN'T REGULARLY APPLYING SECURITY UPDATES MEANING THAT KNOWN VULNERABILITIES PERSISTED IN THE SYSTEM INCREASING THE RISK THAT THOSE VULNERABILITIES COULD BE EXPLOITED. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE NON FINDINGS THAT RIGHT AND IF I DURING THESE ASSESSMENTS WE ALSO NOTE THAT FOR ENTITIES HAD DONE AN ASSESSMENT SO IT'S LIKELY THEY HAVE WEAKNESSES THAT THEY'RE JUST UNAWARE OF BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T DONE THE WORK TO MEASURE THEMSELVES AGAINST THOSE INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES. THAT ARE THAT ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE STANDARDS. HOWEVER WE ALSO NOTED THAT SOME OF THE ENTITIES THAT WERE AWARE OF DEFICIENCIES WEREN'T TAKING ADEQUATE STEPS TO FOLLOW UP ON THOSE DEFICIENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE ONE ENTITY A WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT MILITARY AND DONE AN INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT MILITARY PROVIDED A REPORT IDENTIFIED THE FIVE AREAS OF THE GREATEST RISK TO THAT ENTITY. AND THE SIXTEEN MONTHS AFTER THIS ESTIMATE WE FOLLOWED UP WITH THAT ENTITY AND THEY HAD YET TO FULLYRESOLVE ANY OF THOSE FIVE AREAS. IN FACT THEY HAD NOT IDENTIFIED THE FULL SCOPE OF WORK THEY NEED TO BE DONE. THE TIME LINE FOR YOU FOR DOING THAT WORK OR THE STAFFING RESOURCES NEEDED TO FOR TO FULLY RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE WAS AN ENTITY THAT HAD DEFICIENCIES DATING BACK TO TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND WHEN WE FOLLOWED UP WITH THAT ENTITY TO DETERMINE WHAT HOW ARE YOU TRACKING. THESE DEFICIENCIES THERE ONLY ABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH POWER POINT PRESENTATIONS THAT STAFF HAD PROVIDED. TO THEIR I. T. EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HOWEVER THESE PRESENTATIONS WERE MISSING KEY DETAILS SUCH AS WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THE PROBLEM. WHAT'S THE FULL SCOPE OF WORK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO TO FIX THAT PROBLEM AND WHAT'S THE TIMELINE IN THE TIME LINES IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOME OF THESE ARE A TO SIX YEARS OLD AND STILL NOT RESOLVED. SO WE REALLY WERE CONCERNED THAT NOT EVERYBODY WAS ASSESSING THEMSELVES AND THAT THERE ARE EVEN PEOPLE THAT WERE HAD DEFICIENCIES THAT. THAT WERE REMAINING OUTSTANDING. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE THINK THERE'S OTHER LORD WE BELIEVE THERE'S OTHER DEFICIENCIES THAT AGENCIES ARE JUST UNAWARE OF AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THIRTEEN. YOU CAN SEE THAT WE FOLLOWED UP WITH TEN ENTITIES IN DETAIL. IN NINE OF THE ENTITY SAID THAT THEY FOLLOWED INDUSTRY STANDARDS VERY COMMON LIKE EITHER THE STATE STANDARDS THE FEDERAL STANDARDS OR AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WE FOUND ALL THE STANDARD TO BE VERY COMPARABLE TO EACH OTHER. HOWEVER ONLY SIX HAD FORMALLY ADOPTED THE STANDARDS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO FORMALLY ADOPT THE STANDARDS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE IT. A REPEATABLE IT CONSISTENT WAY TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE PROTECTING YOUR ASSETS IT'S BEST INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES. IN IT ALSO PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR YOU TO EVALUATE YOURSELF OR FOR OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE YOU H. U. AGAINST THOSE STANDARDS. IN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE FOUND THAT ONLY FOUR OF THE TEN ENTITIES HAD FULLY ASSESS THEMSELVES AGAINST THE STANDARDS MEANING THE REMAINING ENTITIES. HAD AREAS IN THEIR SECURITY PRACTICES THAT THEY HADN'T LOOKED AT SO THEY COULD HAVE ADDITIONAL WEAKNESSES IN THESE AREAS BUT THEY JUST HAD LOOKED AT THOSE AREAS. AND THAT'S HIGHLIGHTED BY ENTITY BE ENTITY BE HAD DONE AND ASSESSMENTS THAT LOOK AT OF A SUBSET OF THEIR CONTROLS. AND WHEN WE ASK THEM ABOUT WHY THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT THE FULL SCOPE OF THEIR STANDARDS. A RESPONSE THEY WENT OUT AND FINISH THE ASSESSMENT THEY DID A SUPPLEMENTAL ASSESSMENT THAT LOOK AT THE FULL SCOPE OF ALL THE CONTROLS. WHEN THEY WERE DONE THEY REPORT BACK TO US THAT THEY WERE ONLY ADDITIONAL STANDARDS SO. THERE WAS A LOT OF AREAS OF NON COMPLIANCE THAT THEY JUST HAND IDENTIFIED BECAUSE THEY HAD LOOK VERY NARROWLY INITIALLY. AND AS MS HOUSE SAID EARLIER THESE FINDINGS ARE VERY SIMILAR TARA TWENTY FIFTEEN. AUDIT WHERE WE LOOK AT THE APARTMENT TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENTITIES UNDER ITS PURVIEW IN THAT AUDIT NEARLY ALL SURVEY RESPONDENTS SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT FULLY COMPLIANT. AND THAT'S DESPITE ABOUT HALF OF THEM PREVIOUSLY REPORTING THAT APARTMENT TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY WERE FULLY COMPLIANT AND WHEN WE FOLLOWED UP ON THAT DISCREPANCY WE WERE TOLD THAT. THEY HAD USED A CHECKLIST THEY ONLY CONTAIN HIGH LEVEL LOOK AT A SUBSET OF THE CONTROLS SO THEY WERE THEY WERE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WHERE THEY LOOK VERY NARROWLY TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE FULLY COMPLIANT. AND THEN AS MISS HOW SAID. WE RECOMMENDED A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS TO OVERSIGHT. AND DOES IMPLEMENT OR THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND AS A RESULT IN JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE CONCLUDED THAT THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY HAD IMPROVED ITS OVERSIGHT IN THE COMPLIANCE OF THE ENTITIES THAT IT OVERSEAS HAD INCREASE SO THIS REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT OVERSIGHT CAN HAVE. ON COMPLIANCE. HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK AT NON REPORTING ENTITIES THEY DON'T HAVE A SIMILAR OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE MOST OF THE ENTITIES. WE REVIEWED SAID THEY DON'T HAVE AN OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO ASSESS THEMSELVES AGAINST. ANY INDUSTRY STANDARDS COVER WE DID NOTE THAT. THREE OF THE FOUR ENTITIES THAT HAD FULLY ASSESS THEMSELVES DID HAVE AN OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK THAT REQUIRED THOSE ASSESSMENTS SO ONCE AGAIN HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPACT OF. OF OVERSIGHT SO AS A RESULT WE MADE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED THAT. THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE NON REPORTING ENTITIES TO ADOPT A FRAMER COMPARABLE TO ST FIFTY THREE HUNDRED THE FRAMEWORK MAINTAINED BY DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. THAT THEY REGULARLY MEASURE THEMSELVES AGAINST THOSE STANDARDS. AT LEAST EVERY THREE YEARS AND THEN THAT THEY CONFIDENTIALLY CERTIFY COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE STANDARDS TO LEGISLATURE AND IF NOT IF APPLICABLE THAT THEY SUBMIT CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. FOR ANY OUTSTANDING DEFICIENCIES. SO THAT'S AN OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT AND WITH THAT I'LL TAKING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THIS TIME ITSELF IN A FOR SOME QUESTIONS MISTER COUNTY GO AT. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION FOR THE AUDIT SO IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY WHENEVER WE TRIED TO DO KIND OF ALONG THE LINES WE RECOMMENDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS GENERALLY SHOW UP AND COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. SO I MY QUESTION IS. THE FACT THAT THESE ENTITIES ARE THAT ARE NOT UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE GOVERNOR ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR REPORTER STATE LAW THAT'S A CREATURE OF STATUTE I ASSUME SO. I WATER THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS AS FAR AS BRINGING THOSE ENTITIES UNDER THE SAME SORT OF OVERSIGHT AND POLICIES AS THOSE UNDER CONTROL THE GOVERNOR AND THEN IF THERE ARE NO CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS ARE THERE ANY. REASONS POTENTIALLY WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME STANDARDS AND PROTOCOLS. RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER KILEY I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE CONCERN THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS HAD IN THE PAST WAS SOME OF THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PROPOSED WAS TO HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL. REPORT THE INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SO THEY HAD A CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO THEIR INDEPENDENCE WE BELIEVE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THIS REPORT WHERE. THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS AND OTHER ENTITIES JUDICIAL BRANCH ENTITIES WOULD REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SAID SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT OVER THOSE PARTICULAR ENTITIES BUT IT WOULD NOT. IT WOULD NOT IN OUR VIEW CAUSE A PROBLEM WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEPENDENCE ISSUE THAT. THE CONSTITUTIONAL RAISED IN THE PAST. LOOKED AT LEGAL HERE TODAY BUT I HAVE THEM LOOK AT SOME STATUTORY PROVISIONS UNDER THEY THE OPEN RECORDS ACT LEGISLATIVE OPEN RECORDS ACT AND THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THE LEGISLATIVE OPEN RECORDS ACT THAT ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL AT PARTICULAR IF THERE'S A ALL A SIMILAR LOSS SO MY ATTORNEYS LOOKED AT THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND THERE IS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THAT PROTECTS INFORMATION SECURITY FROM DISCLOSURE SO THAT CAN THAT CAN BE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT SO THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE TAKEN ISMS WITHIN. THE OPEN RECORDS ACT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THIS INFORMATION SO WE THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE IN THE REPORT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THE REPORTS CAN GO TO THE LEGISLATURE THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS CAN GO TO THE LOVED LEGISLATURE AND THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE TWO COMMITTEES I'M HERE TODAY HEY. WE SPECIFY ASSEMBLY PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION CYBER SECURITY COULD ALSO BE INVOLVED UP WOULD. HOW CONSTITUTIONAL AS IN OTHER I ENTITIES ARE DOING AND PROTECTING DATA AND REMEDIATING ISSUES THAT ARE THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. BUT IN THEORY IF I WE WANTED ALL THAT OTHER CONCERTS OFFICES REPORT ADD TO THAT PART OF TECHNOLOGY IT WOULD THERE BE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIER THAT OR THAT JUST BE VIEWED AS SORT OF AN INFRINGEMENT ON THEIR INDEPENDENCE YOU KNOW I DON'T I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD BE SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES I DIDN'T I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THEIR ARGUMENTS WERE AT THE TIME. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN AND PURSUING THAT AVENUE PERHAPS WORK WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL I DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO. ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR. SEVEN I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THIS IT DOES KIND OF SEEM LIKE A RE RUN OF FOUR YEARS AGO SO BUT HOPEFULLY WE END UP WITH THE SAME KIND OF OUTCOMES BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE SAID MANY TIMES THAT SAID DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY REALLY OF. STEPPED UP AND. SO F AYE AYE WE PROBABLY CAN'T TALK ABOUT BLANCA WHETHER THIS IS ACCURATE OR NOT BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES AND OTHER. THE OTHER NON REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION SECURITY EXPERTISE IN THE CAPABILITY TO OPERATE SEPARATELY OR INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH NOW I KNOW WE CAN'T SAY ABOUT ALL OF THEM AND YOU CAN'T CALL OUT CERTAIN AGENCIES BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT THAT DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE AG AND SECRETARY OF STATE HAVE TO MEET. HIGHER STANDARDS THEMSELVES SO WE PRESUME THAT THEY ARE. MOSTLY DOING WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO SOLVE. SO I MEAN I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT BUT JUST IN GENERAL DO YOU THINK THE EXPERTISE IS THERE TO OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY SO WE START A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES WE WENT TO WE WENT TO SOME ENTITIES THAT. SIR BUT THEY WERE MOSTLY OR FULLY COMPLIANT BASED FULLY ENTITIES FULLY ASSESS THEMSELVES THEY HAD OFFICIALLY ADOPTED STANDARDS AND THEY HAD A VERY ROBUST PROCESS WE HIGHLIGHT ONE ENTITY IN THE REPORT THAT HAND ADOPTED ANY STANDARDS AND THEY RELIED SOLELY ON THE JUDGMENT OF THEIR IT MANAGER. SO IS A VERY LESS FORMAL PROCESS. LESS ROBUST SO WE REALLY SAW A WIDE RANGE WORKS SOME PEOPLE HAD. A VERY COMPLETE PROCESS AND SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T SO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU THIS SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY BUT HOW DID THE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED BY OUTSIDE VENDORS COMPARED TO THE SECURITY ASSESSMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY. WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY COMPARE ASSESSMENTS DONE. ACROSS DIFFERENT VENDORS. WE ARE ACTUALLY LOOK TO SEE WHAT ASSESSMENTS HAD THEY HAD AND HOW MUCH OF THEIR STANDARDS THAT THEY FOLLOW WE DID WE DO NOTE THAT MANY ENTITIES DO USE THE DEPARTMENT MILITARY FOR THOSE THOSE ASSESSMENTS. IN DID THOSE ARE GOOD ASSESSMENTS AND THEY'RE VERY HELPFUL BUT THEY'RE NOT COMPREHENSIVE BY THEMSELVES SO. SO WE EXPECT THEM TO DO ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS ON TOP. YES AND I MEAN ULTIMATELY YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO AN APPLES TO APPLES MEMBERS AND EVEN IF YOU'RE USING A OUTSIDE. OF VENDORS SO ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD WITH THE BILL FROM LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR IS THAT. THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT. THAT THE STANDARDS MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES IS THAT A. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYINGBUT WE DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH I MEAN IT IT WOULD BE EACH INDIVIDUAL ENTITY CAN ADOPT STANDARDS AND AS MISTER WARD INDICATED AS WE EXPLAIN IN THE REPORT THERE'S INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THERE'S THE SAM FIFTY THREE HUNDRED THERE'S OTHER STANDARDS AND WE DID A COMPARISON OF THOSE STANDARDS TO SEE ARE THEY SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AND AS MISTER WARD INDICATED THEY'RE RELATIVELY SIMILAR SO EACH OF THE ENTITIES COULD ADOPT STANDARDS. THAT THEY THINK WORKS FOR THEIR PARTICULAR AGENCY AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I MEAN THAT ALLOWS THEM TO CONTINUE THAT INDEPENDENCE AND FOR THOSE ENTITIES THEN TO BE REQUIRED TO ASSESS THEMSELVES AGAINST STANDARDS THAT THEY HAVE FORMALLY ADOPTED THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES IN THIS REPORT THEY'RE THEY'RE SUGGESTING THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING STANDARDS BUT THEY HAVEN'T FORMALLY ADOPTED THEM AND BASICALLY SAID KNOWN FOR THAT AGENCY SAYING WE ARE GOING TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF THESE STANDARDS NEST OR WHATEVER IT THE STANDARDS THEY CHOOSE TO COMPLY WITH. THEN THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ASSESS THEMSELVES AGAINST THOSE STANDARDS AND THEN AS WE RECOMMEND REPORT THAT INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE DONE A COMPREHENSIVE TEST IDENTIFIED HIGH RISK DEFICIENCY IS GOING TO BE A THING KNOWS AND HERE'S OUR TIME FRAME SO I FROM OUR VIEW WE DON'T THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH RESPECT DEPENDS IF REPORTING TOTAL JUST LET RATHER AND TO THE PARK TECHNOLOGY. OKAY AND THEN OF I AM IN THAT DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SO THE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS MAJORITY OF METRIC ABOUT. YOU KNOW FIFTEEN ASSESSMENT AUDIT. DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF EXPERTISE SO YOUNG POTENTIALLY AS A BEST PRACTICE. THEY COULD THEY COULD PURSUE THAT I THINK WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW THERE'S SO MANY THAT AREN'T FULLY ASSESSING THEMSELVES THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE HOW COMPLIANT THEY ARE. SO. FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE TO SET A BASELINE AND THEN MOVE FOR. SO OVER TIME IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM IT BUT AS OF TODAY THEY NEED TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS ASSESS THEMSELVES COMPREHENSIVELY SAID ROOM YOU KNOW DEVELOP MITIGATION PLANS AND THEN THE MATURITY MODEL AND AGAIN I'M NOT THE EXPERT. THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IN THE FUTURE. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M JUST A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS IT ARE THERE ANY ADVANTAGES. LET'S SAY BETWEEN. UTILIZING THAT THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT WHEN IT COMES TO ASSESSMENT VERSUS A PRIVATE AND ENTITY OR A PRIVATE VENDOR. YOU KNOW. DID YOU KNOW OF WE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT. THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE REVIEWS WE WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE DID YOU HAVE A REVIEW WHAT DID YOU LOOK AT. ARE YOU ADDRESSING DEFICIENCIES SO WE DID NOT COMPARE PRIVATE VENDORS VERSES MILITARY AND METHODOLOGIES. SO IN YOUR VIEW SO LONG AS THEY ARE IN COMPLYING WITH ONE OF THE THREE STANDARDS ARE AND THE- YOU KNOW COULD POTENTIALLY BE IT MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE SO TO SPEAK AND THEN REPORTING THE RESULTS OR THE OUTCOME TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT SUFFICES AS FAR AS THE AUDITOR'S. ASSESSMENTS CONCERNS I'VE GONE A CORRECTED. THAT'S CORRECT GOT IT SO IN ANY JUST I WANNA I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT BUT THE THREE STANDARDS THAT YOU MENTION SO THERE AS FAR AS THE QUALITY OR OTHERWISE THERE ARE COMPARABLE I THINK THE VOICE EASE WITH COMPARABLE IDEA A SIMILAR. AND WELL THERE'S THE I. S. O. OR THE SAM OR THE NEST STANDARDS TO THE YOU KNOW ALL THREE CENTERS ARE OKAY BYE BYE YOU FOLKS YES SO ON PAGE FIVE WE LAY OUT THE THREE MOST COMMON STANDARDS. AND IT'S THE I SO THAN BUSINESS AND SAM AND THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP IN FACT SAM SAYS THAT THE MINIMUM BASELINE SECURITY IS NEST. SO THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP A POINT AT EACH OTHER AND THEN ON THE NEXT PAGE PAGE SIX WE LAY OUT. AT A HIGH LEVEL WHAT THE STANDARDS TYPICALLY FOLLOW OR WOULD REQUIRE AND THEY'RE ALL STRUCTURE DIFFERENTLY BUT ADDRESS THE SAME AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO PROTECT THEM WHAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION. YOUR INFORMATION NEEDS GAP IDENTIFIER ASKS THING YOU HAVE TO PLAN TO PROTECT WHAT YOU HAVE AGAINST THOSE RISK AND ALL ALL OF THEM FOLLOW A VERY SIMILAR PATTERN JUST THE FORMATTING AND. THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IS DIFFERENT. GOT IT. OKAY I ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY MYSTERY K. DO THAT FOR EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC A TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. TECHNICAL EXPERTISE OBVIOUSLY HELPS I THINK YOU SOME LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT. BEYOND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS HELPFUL BIG SAMPLE WE POINT OUT WHERE AN ENTITY HAS DEFICIENCIES DATING BACK TO TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN. YOU DON'T NEED TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION SO I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME AREAS WHETHER OR NOT ENTITIES ARE EVALUATING THEMSELVES ARE NOT ARE THEY COMPLAINTS ARE THEY NOT. THERE SOME THINGS THAT DON'T NEED SPECIAL THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AS YOU GET INTO WHAT DEFICIENCIES ARE AND WHAT'S THEIR PLAN IS THAT A GOOD PLAN IF YOU ADVANCE THE OVERSIGHT TO THAT LEVEL THEN THERE WOULD REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. AND YOU HAD I MEAN THE VIEW IT SUGGESTED THAT THAT THE OVERSIGHT COULD BE CARRIED OUT BY THE LEGISLATURE. AS OPPOSED TO SEE TV SO IS THERE DO YOU THINK THERE'S ENOUGH EXPERTISE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO THE FACT THAT THAT THAT. WILL BUT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE EXPERTISE AND THE ABILITY TO HOLD THE ENTITIES ACCOUNTABLE SOME OF THOSE ENTITIES VIEWS MY OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE AYE INTERNAL IT FOLKS WHO ARE EXTREMELY TALENTED WE CONTRACTED OUT TO HAVE OUR ASSESSMENT DONE BECAUSE BEFORE I WAS GONNA CRITICIZEANYBODY ELSE I NEEDED TO KNOW. ARE WE FULLY COMPLIANT. WITH CERTAIN STANDARDS AND WE WERE NOT AND WE NEED TO TIGHTEN UP CERTAIN THINGS SO WE HIRED THE EXPERTISE TO ASSIST US AND DIRECTING US HERE. HERE'S YOUR ASSESSMENT HERE THE WEAKNESSES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO FIX IT BUT I HAD INTERNAL FOLKS ABLE TO DO THOSE TORT TYPES OF THINGS AND- ESTABLISH THE- AS AS- MISTER WARD INDICATED. DO WE HAVE A PLAN. WHERE WE'RE GONNA DRESS THE HIGH RISK DEFICIENCIES IF WE HAD ANY WHAT IS OUR APPROACH AND WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME FOR FIXING THAT SO THE LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY HAS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT AS FAR AS- HAVE YOU HAD AN ASSESSMENT DONE. HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED THOSE WEAKNESSES WHEN OUR YOU'RE GOING TO CORRECT THEM WHICH ONES ARE HIGH RISK THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND THOSE. KEYS MAY THAT MAY HAVE THE IN HOUSE EXPERTISE AS MISTER WARD SAID. DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE NCS SOME OF THE- CONSTITUTIONAL IN PARTICULAR MAY HAVE THAT EXPERTISE IN HOUSE. BUT IF THEY DON'T THEY THEY CONTRACT BUT FOR THAT. TIME NOW FOR THEM TO DO THAT. ALSO CONDUCTED ACOSTA ANNOUNCES OR COST ON COMPARISON BETWEEN LET'S SAY ON THE ONE HAND. OF THE NON REPORTING AGENCIES DOING THEIR OWN ASSESSMENTS VERSUS. OUR THE LET'S SAY THE CD T. PERFORMING MOST OF THE ASSESSMENTS WAS HER COME COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO. WELL WE DIDN'T DO THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS. OKAY IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SO I WANT TO THANK OF THE PANELISTS FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY IF YOU COULD STAY A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO THAT MIGHT BE QUESTIONS THAT TAMI RYSSA. SO I THANK YOU AND LET'S BRING UP A SECOND PANEL. REPRESENTING THE SECOND PANEL WE HAVE ANY THàNH WHO IS THE DIRECTOR AND STATE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER. HAS WELL AS SOME METALLIC. A TALLY T. PENICHE ARE ACTING STATE. CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER SO FEEL FREE TO CORRECT MY PRONUNCIATION. ALSO I WON THE THIS IS THE NOTED GERMAN SO. I WANT TO WELCOME YOU AND FEEL FREE TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES PLEASE HI I'M AMANDA BULLOCK CHIEF OF POLICIES PROJECT PLANNING FOR DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU WELCOME THANKS CHAIR ONE CHURCH I'LL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCHFOR HAVINGUS OVER I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. AND FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS VITALI PENICHE ACTING STATE CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER. THANK YOU AND WELCOME AND THAT CHAIR A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY I'M AMY THàNH DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND I'M HERE HAPPY TO THIS ANY QUESTIONS OR CONVERSATION YOU LIKE TO HAVE IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFICALLY THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. NUMBER PRIOR TO JUMPING TO THAT IF I MAY TAKE JUST A COUPLE MINUTES TO PERHAPS LAY OUT A CONTACT'S CONVERSATION LITTLE BIT OF A HISTORY ESPECIALLY I HEARD THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF A MISSION COMPARING TO ON THE AUDIT REPORT THAT WAS CONDUCTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN RE RELEASE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THE EFFORT THAT WAS IN PLACE. SINCE THEN. SO A LITTLE BIT OF A BACKGROUND I YOU DOES IT HAVE THE I WAS APPOINTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BY. A FORMER ADMINISTRATION GOVERNOR BROWN TO THIS PARTICULAR ROLE ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITY WHEN I CAME IN IT WAS SPECIFICALLY ON CYBERSECURITY. AND THAT WAS ALSO AROUND THE TIME THAT I DOUBT EXECUTIVE ORDER NOW IT'S BY STATUTE DEKSTOP WHICH MEN OF CALIFORNIA. AS CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER. AND WITHOUT EXTRAPOLATION MEN OF FOR PRINCIPLE DEPARTMENTS TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL IN CALIFORNIA. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ALONG WITH MY DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WE CALL OURSELF THE CORE FOR. ARE THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER. JOINING AT THE HEARING TODAY WE HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CORE FOR SITTING THE FIRST ROLE. SO THAT IF THERE'S EVER A NEED I NEED A PHONE A FRIEND I CAN TURN AROUND AND- THEY'LL BE ABLE TO STEP UP AND HELP OUT. AND THEIR ATTENDANCE TODAY ISVERY SIGNIFICANT TO ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT WHEN HE COMES TO CYBERSECURITY. ITS ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT. AND EVEN THOUGH I APPRECIATE THE AUDITOR'S RECOGNITION AND THE LEGISLATURE'S RECOGNITION THAT SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AUDIT DODD A DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ALONG WITH THE HELP WITH OUR PARTNERS IN CAL SICK. HAVE MADE BY PROGRESS. TOWARDS THE PRODUCTION BETTER PROTECTION OF THE STATE. I CAN SAFELY SAY WERE ONLY SCRATCH THE SURFACE. AND WE ALWAYS HAVE THIS MODEL THAT IS NOT A MATTER OF IF THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CYBERSECURITY RELATED INCIDENT IS MATTER OF WHEN. SO BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WE REMAIN VERY VIGILANT AND YOU KNOW CORPS NAY BEING PRO ACTIVE PARTNERS THAT ARE GOING BEYOND THE BOUNDARY OF STATE ENTITIES. WITH CAL SAKE AND AS WELL AS WITH OUR CONNECTION WITH THE LOCALS WE CONSTANTLY TALK TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THEIR PRODUCTION WHEN IT COMES TO DATA AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC SECTOR. BECAUSE ONE FUNDAMENTAL KEY THAT WE ON TO EMPHASIZE WHEN HE COMES THROUGH CYBERSECURITY DATA SHARING INFORMATION SHARING IS WITHOUT THE BOUNDARY. WITHOUT THE BOUNDARY OF WHO YOU'RE REPORTING TO WITHOUT THE BOUNDARY OF WHAT TO ORGANIZATION CHARTS SPEAK TO INFORMATION FREE FLOWS AND THAT'S WHERE ALSO BECOMES THE BOND ABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO CYBERSECURITY MEASURE. SO WITH THAT. THE MINUTE IF THE COUPLE MORE POINTS ON THAT IN ADDITION TO THE EXTRAPOLATION MEN OF CAL SICK THERE WAS A I I'VE HEARD A LOT OF QUESTIONS EARLY ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OVERSIGHT I'M I WANTED TO PERHAPS OUT OF CONTEXT THAT WHEN HE COMES TO THE U. RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSIGHT THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY HIGHS IT'S MORE THAN THE FACT OF MAKING SURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAVE COMPLIANCY OR SELF REPORTED COMPLIANCE STATE. AS ONE OF THE FINDING THAT WAS FOUND BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THIRTEEN AND WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ADDRESSING IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS ENTITY THEMSELVES TO SELF SAID I'M COMPLIANT. IT IS THE CONTINUED JOURNEY IN HELPING THEM NOT ONLY TO SAY YOURSELF COMPLIANT BUT LEFT HAS FOR YOU ARE YOU MEETING THOSE COMPLIANCY AND IF YOU'RE NOT LET'S HELP YOU TO CONTINUE TO MATURE AND THAT'S WHY THE ROUGH FRIENDS THE MATURE THE METRICS AND THEN AND THEN IF YOU STATE YOUR MAKE PROGRESS GREAT ON THOSE PIRATES ENTITY LET'S CONDUCT ADDITIONAL AUDIT WHICH IS THE RISK BELIEVE. IN TECHNOLOGY SO THAT WE COULD HELP YOU TO ASSURE THAT FROM A POLICY MORE WE STAND FOR COMPARISON AS WELL AS IF PRACTICAL. IMPLEMENT XIN JUST TEN OF THE. AND IS READY ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY MILITARY. IS THIS WHAT WE CALL IT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A DIAGRAM THAT SHOWS A CYCLE OF FROM MY END YOU COMPLIANCE SELF OF REPORTING. TO A BI ANNUAL INDEPENDENT A SECURITY ASSESSMENT DIED OF A MILITARY CONDUCT OR A THIRD PARTY TO A- TRY ANNUAL AND NOW WE ACTUALLY BECOMES MORE OF A THREE TO FOUR YEAR TYPE OF AUDIT. AS WELL AS THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MONITORING WHERE THEY ARE A MATURING THEIR SECURITY MEASURE. ON TOP OF DIED EVERY INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE OR IN GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL IT'S ALSO A INFORMATION AND LEARNING EXPERIENCE SO FROM THERE IS MIGHT NOT MATTER OF SIMPLY SINGLE INCIDENT HAPPENED LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND WE MEET. HEY BUT WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM THAT INCIDENT HOW DO WE RE MEDIA FROM IT BECOMES A POWERFUL KNOWLEDGE SHARING AS WELL AS INTELLIGENCE SHARING THAT WE PROVIDE. AS AS THIS BROADER UMBRELLA OF THE OVERSIGHT AND DIED IT'S REALLY THE MISSION OF ON THE CAL SICK AS WELL AS. PARTICIPATION A CORE FOR WHEN IT COMES TO CYBERSCURITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GERMAN ANYTHING TO ADD. I YEAH I WILL HAVE WILL DEFINITELY I'LL JUST TO REITERATE THE POINT CYBER SECURITY IS TRULY A TEAM SPORT AND NEEDS TO BE A TEAM SPORT THERE ARE MANY MANY ADVERSARIES OUT THERE IN THE WORLD THE TACKING US TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN AROUND THE CLOCK. IN THE NEED TO GET LUCK YOU'RE RIGHT ONCE ONLY WHILE ONLY ONCE US AS THE GOOD GUYS THE DEFENDERS WE NEED TO BE RIGHT A 100% OF THE TIME ALL THE TIME AND WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE AND JUST AN ISLAND OR IN ONE DEPARTMENT OR ONE AGENCY. ALSO THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER AS A QUORUM FOR TO REALLY UNIFIER BECAUSE WHERE WE TRULY CANNOT PRACTICE THIS US SPORT ALONE JUST LIKE. AMY AMY REFERRED TO AS ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT SO I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE BANDING TOGETHER OF DEPARTMENTS AND KIND OF PUSHING THE MISSION OF MATURING SECURITY AND WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN WE DO THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE DO THROUGH OUR GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT ONE OF THE THINGS AMY REFER TO IS THE TRAINING AND THE GUIDANCE WE PROVIDE SO WE DO COLLECT A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE A LOT OF DATA FROM FROM OUR DEPARTMENTS IN THE FORM OF AUDITS ASSESSMENT. WEEK GOALIE THAT DATA AND ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE RELEVANT RELEVANT POLICIES AND GUIDANCE TO DEPARTMENT SO THAT THEY THEY CAN MATURE AND SOLVE THE RIGHT THINGS. AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE RIGHT PRICE TO BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T OVER INVEST OR UNDER VESTED SECURITY WE REALLY NEED TO. FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE AND WE REALLY ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT USING KIND OF THIS OVERSIGHT CYCLE THAT WE HAVE BEEN PRACTICING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CAN A CONTINUING TO BUILD OUT THERE AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY. THINGS WE COULD DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER BASED ON PRE PRIOR LESSONS LEARNED IDEALLY I'D LIKE TO PRACTICE AND AUDIT AN ASSESSMENT PRACTICE CONTINUOUSLY SO THAT WE'RE NOT KINDA DOING THAT ARE AT A POINT IN TIME BALANCE. BECAUSE WE TRULY NEED TO BE FASTER THAN THE ADVERSARIES TO THE ATTACKERS THE THAT WERE ARE OFTEN TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT. TO ON. YOUR CANAL. VERY GOOD SO WITH THAT LIKE TO OPEN IN A FOR A COMMON QUESTION MISTER KILEY GUY. GOOD AFTERNOON TRUCK TONKA. DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT INTERFACE AT ALL WITH THE NON REPORTING AGENCIES IN ANYWAY YES WE ACTUALLY DO AND ALSO TO ALSO ADD ADDITIONAL CONTEXT TO THAT. THE AUDITOR REPORT AS IN NON REPORTING AGENCY IN IN OUR DEFINITION WHEN HE COMES FOR NOT REPORTING AGENCY IT ACTUALLY GOES BEYOND ON THE CONSTITUTION OFFICE WE ALSO HAVE INDEPENDENT ENTITIES THAT ARE WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT ARE WORKING IT YOU KNOW AT THAT NOT UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION IF YOU WERE BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. BUT IS PART OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AS WELL AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW JUDICIAL BRANCH ANOTHER BRANCH YOU KNOW AS MISSION SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE SAID AND NINE REPORTING AGENCY WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT SCENARIO WHEN IT COMES TO CONSTITUTIONAL VERSUS NON CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICE. SO HOW DO YOU INTERFACE WITH THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED NON REPORTING. SO WE INTERFACE WITH THEM IN SEVERAL ASPECT IN IN FACT I WOULD ASK I'M IMPAIR ACHIEVE A POLICY TO CHIMING AT CC FIT AS WELL. THAT IN TO DATE WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY OVERSIGHT JUST AS OUR SISTER DEPARTMENT WHAT A AS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT HR WE DO HAVE BUSINESS OPERATION TYPE OF OVERSIGHT. YOU KNOW WITH THOSE ENTITY WE PROVIDE OUR INTERACTION WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICE IN MANY CASES IS THE PROJECT OVERSIGHT. SO WHEN THERE'S A TECHNOLOGY PROJECT A CERTAIN THRESHOLD THAT REQUIRES FINDING YOU KNOW TO LEGISLATURE WE PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY. TO THEM AS WELL AS OTHER BUSINESS FUNCTION A CHECK SUCH AS YOU KNOW HR AND PROCUREMENT WE DO THAT AS WELL. SO I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING I YEAH JUST GO ALONG THE LINES ABSENT ACIDITY IS THERE CONTROL AGENCY SIMILAR TO. THE OTHER CONTROL AGENCIES WE DO. ADMINISTERED SIMILAR PROGRAMS AND JUST LIKE H. R. PROCUREMENT CDT DOES TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC OVERSIGHT. TO OTHER ENTITIES WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AS WELL AND THEN. THOSE STANDARDS THAT WE DO APPLY ARE ALL CONSISTENTLY PUT INTO A STANDARD THE STATE. ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL AND SO DOES STANDARDS ALSO COVER IN ADDITION IT AND SECURITY THEY COVER PROCUREMENT. AS WELL AS HR POLICIES AS WELL. SO THERE'S ALREADY THAT LEVEL OR SAY WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH SIMPLY HAVING ALL. ENTITIES ABIDE BY THE SAME INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARD AND BE SUBJECT YEAR OVERSIGHT AND TURN TERMS OF COMPLIANCE DO YOU THINK THAT IF WE WERE TO DO THAT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPROVE OUR- INFORMATION SECURITY SITUATION. I WOULD I WOULD DEFINITELY SAID DIED DEPENDING ON WHAT ORDER CONSTITUTIONAL PROBABLY HAVE A DIFFERENT AREA OF THE CONCERNS VERSUS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES OR ANOTHER BRANCH. I WOULD DEFER TO THOSE CONCERNED FOR THEM TO SPEAK TO HOWEVER I DO WANT TO CLARIFY DIED EARLIER WHEN THERE WAS DISCUSSION. ABOUT THIS AND SPECIFICALLY ON THE YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE THE STATE WIDE SECURITY MEASURE. IS DEFINITELY NOT OUR INTENTION AT ALL TO HAVE ANY INTERFERENCE OR IN PEAK INTO WHAT I CALL THE MAIN LINES OF BUSINESS OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS. THE SECURITY MEASURE SIMILAR TO WHEN IT COMES TO PROJECTS TO HR WE SEE IT AS ME THAT ONE OF THE BUSINESS OPERATION. AND THAT'S WHERE WE LIKE TO SEE TO HAVE CONSISTENCY WHEN IT COMES TO MEASUREMENT AND OVERSIGHT. RIGHT SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU KNOW SUBSECTORS ALASTOR IN THE WORLD WHERE WE WANT TO HAVE OF FRAGMENTATION. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND SO THE DISTINCTION YOU JUST RECEIVED TO MAKE SENSE I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF EXECUTIVE THE INDEPENDENCE OF. EACH OF THE EXECUTIVE OR EVEN THE INDEPENDENT EXECUTIVE AGENCIES A SOMETHING THAT'S- IMPORTANT YOU KNOW AS COMPLIANCE WITH AN INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARD AS A MINISTERIAL FUNCTION ESSENTIALLY I MEAN MAYBE YOU KNOW. THAT THAT'S NOT A POLICY MAKING FUNCTION AND SO I THE CONCERNS ABOUT INDEPENDENT SEEM A LITTLE. AS UNFOUNDED TO ME AND IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY CARE ABOUT I MEAN ARE THERE OTHER SOLUTIONS COULD WE MAKE YOUR DEPARTMENT SOMEHOW AN INDEPENDENT. DEPARTMENT SO THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THIS CONCERN ABOUT OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICES HAVEN'T REPORT TO SOMETHING THAT'S UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR. WATER THAT WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO HAVE A MORE UNIFIED APPROACH. I WOULDN'T VENTURE OUT TO SAID I HAVE ANSWER FOR THAT THE BUT I THINK THIS IS WHY WERE. HERE HAVING A CONVERSATION AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE INPUT AND IDEAS YOU KNOW BY THE AUDITOR'S. I THINK I BELIEVE THE ANGLE IS THE SAME AND- IN ALL FAIRNESS ALL THE INDEPENDENT ENTITY THAT WE HAVE TALKED TO THEY HAVE THE SAME. SIMILAR ANGLE IT IS THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO WORK TOGETHER. TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHER LEVEL OF CYBER SECURITY PROTECTION. I THINK IS WOULD IT NEEDS TO HAVE A GOOD OPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT. HOW TO GET THERE AND PERHAPS OR OPTIONS AT THE TABLE. THANK YOU. SEVEN DIED WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU DO COLLABORATOR READY WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL AS AND OTHER NON REPORTING AGENCIES BUT YOU WEREN'T REALLY SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT INFORMATION SECURITY YOU'RE NOT A USER COLLABORATION IN THAT AREA SOLD IT LET ME MAKE SURE I'VE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION INFORMATION SECURITY TO DATE WE DO NOT HAVE PER VIEW AS THE YOU KNOW THE AUDITOR'S REPORT HAVE A DEFINED INTO WITH THE SECURITY PRACTICE OF THOSE INDEPENDENCE HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME INDEPENDENCE AND TWO TEETH ARE VOLUNTARILY COMPLIANT AND HAVE BEEN VERY COLLABORATIVE AND- YOU KNOW WORKING WITH US ON THAT. AND LIVES LET'S SAY SPECIFICALLY I KNOW YOU THESE THREAT ASSESSMENTS THAT YOU PASS OUT TO ALL THE YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ARE YOU SHARING THAT THREAT ANALYSIS WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL IS ANOTHER NON REPORTING AGENCIES. YOU'VE ANY AGENCY THAT HAVE ASK FOR THOSE INFORMATION OR HAVE REACH OUT TO NOT ONLY DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY BURKE. BUT WITH CAL SICK AS WELL WHICH WERE PART OF WERE OPENLY SHARING THOSE INFORMATION AND IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION THAT HAVE ASKED TO SEE THIS I MEAN THE THREAT INFORMATION SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE QUITE. VALUABLE IF YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN. SO ISN'T AS AN IRISH. YEAH THIS IS AN EXAMPLE YEAH THERE ARE CERTAIN ENTITIES THAT DO VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN IN OUR OVERSIGHT BUT DO IT TO A DEGREE NOT FULLY. AS THAT EXAMPLE THEY DO PROVIDE THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION VIA OUR DESIGNATION LETTERS. AND WE DO LEVERAGE THAT CONTACT INFORMATION TO DISSEMINATE AND BROADCAST OUT THREAT INFORMATION. AND ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE CERTAIN I ESOS THAT DO COME TO OUR- MEETINGS AND TRAININGS AND BRIEFINGS. WE ALSO BROADCAST AND DISSEMINATE SOME THREAT INFORMATION THERE AND IN ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO SIGN UP ON SOME OF OUR MAILING LISTS ON. INCLUDING THINGS LIKE MSI SACK. WHICH IS A REALLY A GREAT SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR PROTECTION AND DEFENSE. HI I GET THAT I'M I'M AND YOU'RE SAYING SOME OF THEM BUT I'M JUST SAYING IS THAT. A SIGNIFICANT LIKE WHAT PERCENT. OF ALL THESE NON REPORTING AGENCIES ARE WORKING AT LEAST COLLABORATIVELY WITH YOU ON THAT. ARE GETTING A THREAT INFORMATION RIGHT I THINK FROM INFORMATION SHARING WHICH IS A ONE WAY COMMUNICATION AND JUST WERE WERE BEING VERY OPEN ABOUT IT THAT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHOEVER IS WILLING TO SIGN UP TO OUR YOU KNOW DISTRIBUTION MAILING LIST. THEY THEY COME AND WE AND WE INVITE THOSE INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER IN THE DEPARTMENT TO JOIN OUR REGULAR MEETINGS. PERCENTAGE WISE I DON'T KNOW IF WE KNOW THAT WITH OUR HEAD I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WE WOULD HAVE TO REFER TO OUR INTERNAL KIND OF DATABASE THAT WE COLLATE THAT INFORMATION IN. THAT BUT I WOULD SAY IS INCONSISTENT. IT SOMETIMES IS DEPENDING ON THE NEED OR AT ON AT HAWK BASIS. BY DUBBED THE INFORMATION SHARING AND STUFF AND ONLY HAS BEEN. YOU KNOW. QUITE OPEN. OKAY AND THEN I ALSO HAD ASK THE AUDITOR ABOUT WHETHER THERE. AND EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT REQUIRES SPECIFIC TECHNICAL EXPERTISE I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ADD ANYTHING TO WHAT SHE SAID. PARDON DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANY. I'D I'D BUT BE HAPPY TO AYE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WHEN HE COMES TO IT REALLY SAID THE DEFINITION OF OVERSIGHT RAY FROM ANYWHERE TO MAKING SURE SOMEBODY AS A REPORTING THAT THERE ARE COMPLIANT AND THIS AUDITOR'S HAVE POINTED OUT THAT LEVEL OVERSIGHT YOU PROBABLY DO NOT NEED A- YOU KNOW SECURITY IT TECHNICAL SKILL IT SAID OTHER THAN SAY YEP YOUR WE WERE REPORTING YES WE'RE STUFF COMPLIANT. BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO DEEPER TO REALLY ASSESS WHAT THEY'RE REPORTING IS SELF REPORTING IS CORRECT OR MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR GOAL OF OUR OVERSIGHT CYCLE IS NOT TO POINT THEM WHAT THEY DID NOT DO BUT HELP THEM TO GET BETTER AND THAT HELP THEM TO GET BETTER THROUGH TRAINING ADVISORY SERVICE OR EVEN WHEN THEY SAY HEY WE THINK WE DO THIS BUT WHEN WE ASSESS THEY REALLY DIDN'T. WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM TO SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO REACH THE NEXT LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE AND THAT LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT IN MY OPINION WE REALLY BENEFIT FROM A TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. AND JUST OUT TO THAT IF I MAY SOUND. COMPLIANCE ALONE DOES NOT EQUAL SECURITY COMPLIANCE ALONE SO IT'S A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD A BASS LINE IF YOU WILL THAT THAT'S CONSISTENT ACROSS THE BOARD AND IT SHOULD BE CONSISTENT THAT'S KIND OF WHY WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY IS TO KIND OF. SET THAT CONSISTENCY ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES. BUT THEN WE NEED TO GO FURTHER BEYOND COMPLIANCE HOW DO WE MEASURE OUR COMPLIANCE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IT'S EFFECTIVE IT'S STAYING UP TO DATE. SO THAT'S WHAT WE ALSO TRY TO ENFORCE AND DO WITH SOME OF OUR- MILITARY DEPARTMENT INFORMATION SECURITY ASSESSMENTS ARE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS IT'S REALLY TO MEASURE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CONTROLS WERE WERE IN FORCING AND OUTLINING FOR THE DEPARTMENTS. AND REALLY THE GOAL IS TO ENFORCE IT AND CONDUCT OUR PRACTICE WITH THE UNIFIED WANT ONE MEASURING STICK THAT'S THAT'S CONSISTENT. DO THINK THAT ADOPTING ONE STANDARD OVER THE OTHER WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE SECURITY AT THE STATE. THE QUESTION OF A LIKE A TOP IN ONE OF THE THREE STANDARDS OR THE OTHER OR HAVING A CONSISTENT STANDARD WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON THE- THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND THE NEEDS OF TO BE STANDARD YEAH. OF ALL HAVE A TELL YOU CHIME IN I KNOW HIS OF BEEN WANTING TO SPEAK TO RALPH IF I I'LL I'LL ACT ABRUPT BROADLY. THE I SO STANDARD FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE UNIVERSAL MORE GENERIC IT'S SUPPLY TYPICALLY GLOBALLY IT'S ACTUALLY RAN BY THE BY AN NGO HEADQUARTERED AND SWITZERLAND FROM THE MISTAKEN. SO WE'VE ADOPTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS STATE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE WHICH IS THE CURRENT REVISION FOR AND WE LEVERAGE SOME OF THE SECURITY CONTROLS AND SECURITY DOMAINS WITHIN OUR SAM FIFTY THREE HUNDRED SO IT'S REALLY SIMILAR AND THEY THEY REALLY CORRELATE TO EACH OTHER. BUT THEN THE NEXT EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE IS A SUPERSET IF YOU WILL. OF THE I. SO TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED OR TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND TWO STANDARD SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC FOR MORE SPECIFIC SPECIFICITY THAT'S BECAUSE THE I SO STANDARDS A LITTLE BIT MORE IT HAS TO BE UNIVERSAL BECAUSE IT IT DOES APPLY GLOBALLY SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY COVER EVERYTHING. SO WHICH IS WHY WE CHOSE TO APPLY THE NATIONAL FEDERAL A FRAMEWORK AND WITH IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT Y. WEEK MAP THAT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. RAYMOUR BUT WE CAN. ADD OR REDUCE TO IT THAT WAY WE CAN ADD MORE SPECIFICITY TO CERTAIN CONTROLS IN THE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE. VERSUS SUBJECTIVE BECAUSE SOME OF THESE CONTROLS CAN BE APPLIED DIFFERENTLY WHETHER YOU'RE DOING BUSINESS. LOCALLY AND ON PREMISES WITHIN THE PHYSICAL DATA CENTER OR IN THE CLOUD OR OR VARIOUS OTHER EXAMPLES THAT WE GET A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF GUIDING OUR- ENTITIES THAT WE OVERSEE INTO. HOW YOU SHOULD DEPLOY A PARTICULAR STANDARD. RIGHT SO IT YOU KNOW TO ADD ON WHAT BATALI SAME BASICALLY OUR PREFERENCE IS TO HAVE ONE SET OF STANDARDS. AND THE REASON IS AGAIN YOU KNOW ADOPTING ONCE AND SETS OF STANDARDS NOT ONLY SOLELY FOR THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY CHECK OFF THE BOX YES I'M GONNA USE THAT FOR MY COMPLIANCE MEASUREMENT. BUT REALLY TO THROUGH THAT ONE SET OF STANDARDS WHEN YOU COME TO A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE WORKING WITH THOSE ALREADY IN A LIMITED TECHNICAL RESOURCE. RESOURCES TO HELP RELIEVE EACH OF THE ENTITY TO MATURE IN ACHIEVING THOSE STANDARDS DO BETTER WITH IT AND DIED HAVING A STANDARD SO THAT WE CAN WORK FROM THE SAME SHEET OF MUSIC IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN IF EVERYBODY'S REFERRING TO A DIFFERENT SETS OF STANDARDS. SEPARATELY WHEN IT COMES TO WIDE THE SAM WHICH IS THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL COMPARING TO THE NEST UNDER WHICH IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OR THE I SAW CENTER WHICH IS MORE GLOBAL. IT'S S. PATEL THE APPOINTED AL DIED THE LARGER THE STANDARD IS BEING CREATED. THE BROADER IT BECOMES SO THAT IN MANY CASES YOU MIGHT HAVE ITEMS THAT ARE COVERING GLOBAL NEEDS THAT NOT NECESSARILY NOT VERY SPECIFIC TO A STATE OPERATION. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WHAT WE DID IN FACT BACK INTO THE HOUSE THE SISTINE WE ACTUALLY OF HAVE THE CONTRACTED WITH GARTNER TO DO WHAT IS CALLED A STANDARD COMPARISON. LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE STATE OF I STILL LOOK IN AN ENTIRE SET OF THIS STATE UNDER. IN MAPPING INTO WHAT CALIFORNIA SAM SPECIFIC STANDARD THAT WE REALLY IT'S APPLICABLES TO THE OPERATION OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT THEN WE CAN REALLY HELP PRIORITIZE THE ALREADY LIMITED IN A RESOURCE WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICATION. DON'T JUST SOLVE PROBLEM BROAD BUT MAKING THEM MORE MEANINGFUL AND MORE TARGETED TO ADDRESSED SO WITH THE ADOPTION OF SAM WE WERE ABLE TO GO DEEPER. AND HELPING THE DEPARTMENT TO GET MATURE ON THOSE INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THINGS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELEVANT. TO THEIR. THIS OKAY AND I JUST BUT I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE YOUR TIME AT THE MATURITY METRIC IN THE AUDITS AND THE ASSESSMENT SENT WOULD WOULD AND I KNOW THAT'S WAS DEVELOPED INTERNALLY. AND IT WOULD BASICALLY. RIGHT THE IT DOES SECURITY MADE AT THAT THE MAJORITY MATTER WITH SWISS WITH SUPPORT FROM THE CALL FOR AS WELL AS YOU KNOW GARDENERS AND OTHER VENDORS THAT WE HAVE SOLICITED SO THAT THAT MATURITY METRIC I KNOW THE AUDITOR SAID SOME OF THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES AREN'T READY TO DO THAT BUT IT ONCE IT GETS TO THAT POINT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE ADOPTABLE BY OTHER THE CONSTITUTIONAL AS ARE NOT REPORTING ENTITIES. THE METRIC THAT YOU USE. RIGHT THE THESE THE MATURITY METRIC IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE THINGS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH ANYBODY IT UP. YOU KNOW WANTED TO USE IT I DO AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR'S ASIDE THAT THE FIRST LINE IS TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE. WHICH IS WHERE A LOT OF ORIENTED HE STARTED WITH A FEW YEARS BACK. BUT ONCE YOU ESTABLISH THAT PLACE LINE GIVING HOW FAST EVERYTHING HAS EVOLVE IT'S DEAD IT'S REALLY ABOUT KEEP NOT ONLY KEEPING UP FOR COMPLIANCE BUT HOW DO YOU TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE. AND GET AHEAD OF IT AND BASS THE FOCUS OF OUR OVERSIGHT CYCLE IS TO ACHIEVE A MAJORITY. NOT ONLY COMPLIANCE RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT BEEN RAISED. ON THE ISSUE OF ADOPTION OF DIFFERENT STANDARDS AYE YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE THREE STAND AS BEING. SAM BE MORE SPECIFIC AND THIS BEING A LITTLE MORE. I GUESS NATIONWIDE AND ALSO I S. WILL BE MORE GLOBAL. NOW DOES THE ADOPTION OF SPECIFIC STANDARD IMPACT THE ISSUE OF ALL INTEROPERABLE EDDIE LET'S SAY. OF BETWEEN FOLKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHOSE RACES OF THE SEASON AND YOU KNOW SEEM EVEN SOME GLOBAL. OF SERGIO ENTITIES. AND IF NOT WHY NOT. AND IT GETS HERE FOR THE CHAMPION I DOT THE YES STOPS THE ADOPTION OF A STANDARD IS SOMETHING THAT IS MORE OF A USING WHAT TYPE OF REFERENCE GUY. THAT YOU USE AND HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF BECOME COMPLIANT OR MATURE TOWARDS THAT STANDARD IS WHERE THE ARTISTS BUT SIMPLY HAVING ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD DOES NOT IN MY OPINION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT OR IN A YOU KNOW IMPEDING THE INTER OPERABILITY. WHEN IT COMES TO INFORMATION SHARING. TO ACT IN IDEALLY SINCE WE PART PARTNER WITH SOME OF THE FEDERAL PARTNERS VIA THE MSI SACK AND VIA THE FEDERAL PARTNERS VIA THE CAL SICK. THEN THIS HAS BEEN KIND OF THE DE FACTO STANDARD WHETHER IT'S IN THIS STATE UNDER FIFTY THREE OR THE NESTS YOURSELF SO THAT THAT IS KIND OF OUR IDEAL METHODOLOGY IS TO MAP MAP. CALIFORNIA STANDARD TO THAT FRAMEWORK JUST SO WE CAN INTER OPERATE A LITTLE BIT BETTER WITH PARTNERS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE NOT ADOPTED THE ISEL STANDARD. FOR MANY REASONS THE I. SO AS A STANDARD IS A LITTLE BIT MORE BROAD AND IT DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF CERTAIN I GUESS PRIVACY OR CRYPTOGRAPHY OR TRANSPARENCY ISSUES DO YOU DO TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE. AND THEN SINCE THE I SO STANDARD APPLIES INTERNATIONALLY THE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE THE IDEAL STANDARD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAVE ARE KINDA UNIQUE. TRANSPARENCY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY. STANCES IN LAWS. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE THE ENTITIES THAT. BEEN SURVEY OUR TOP TWO ONE OF WHICH HOW MANY OF THE ENTITIES ADOPTED. THE THREE ONE OF THE THREE. OR IS DO YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION WHATEVER IS OUT QUESTION FOR THE AUDITOR. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY A HE QUESTION TODAY AUDITOR BECAUSE THEM. I'M JUST WARNING YOU WONDERING WHY DID ADOPTED CERTAIN STANDARD AND I'D SAY. THE AG'S OFFICE VERSUS ANOTHER CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES ADOPTING DIFFERENT STANDARDS YOU KNOW I I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE RATIONALE WAS IN DOING THAT IF. IT IS. NEAR THE CELL IS UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL AS WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T WOULDN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN BUT REALLY THE ENTITIES WE DO OVERSEE. ARE ARE WORKING. TOWARDS ADOPTING OUR STANDARDS AS AS BEST AS THEY CAN. YEAH LET ME ASK A QUESTION THAT I ASKED OF THE ARE TURNED OUT AS- COMPARISON BETWEEN USING LET'S SAY THE CALIFORNIA MILITARIES. OUR DEPARTMENT VERSES THAT'S A PRIVATE ENTITY OF AND THERE ARE THERE ANY ADVANTAGES ADVANTAGES TO USING ONE OVER THE OTHER THAT YOU KNOW. IN YOUR VIEW. YEAH I CAN I CAN ANSWER THAT AND DEFINITELY THE ADVANTAGES TO. ESSENTIALLY FOR USE ONE CONTRACTOR TO DO OUR INFORMATION SECURITY ASSESSMENT. WILL HAVE MORE CONSISTENCY IN THE DELIVERABLES IN THE METRICS WE KEEP TRACK OF BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS BETWEEN AGENCIES AND KINDA TRENDING YEAR OVER YEAR. IDEALLY I'D LIKE TO STANDARDIZE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. ON THE ONE CONTRACTOR AND ARE KIND AND GO TO CONTRACTOR RIGHT NOW IS THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. SO FOR CONSISTENCY SAKE IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO USE WANT ONE SET OF CONTRACTORS THAT DO A REALLY GREAT JOB IN DELIVERING WHAT THEY DO. IF I CAN ADD A LITTLE BIT OF STATISTIC THIS IS WERE PROVIDED BY STAFF SIDE IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THERE WAS ABOUT EIGHT AM INDEPENDENCE SECURITY ASSESSMENT THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY A PRIVATE PROVIDER. AND SEVEN OUT OF THOSE EIGHT DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA THAT WAS JOINTLY DEVELOPED BY OUR CORE FOR ENTITY IN TERM OF MEASUREMENTS THE R. MEANINGFUL AND VALUABLE AND CAN TRULY MEASURE THE SICK THE MATURITY. I'M NOT ONLY TO COMPLIANCE SO I AM I DEAD THAT MAY BE DUE TO. YOU KNOW MULTIPLE OF REASONS I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT'S BECAUSE OF THAT THE OUTSIDE VENDOR SERVICE IS NOT GOOD THAT'S NOT ONE THING AT ALL BUT I WOULD SAY THAT. EVEN IF THE DEPARTMENT WOULD LIKE TO USE AN OUTSIDE PROVIDER FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE SECURITY ASSESSMENT I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE TO SPEND A TO TAKE A LOOK THE PUBLISHED A SECURITY MEASURE MAIN CRITERIA SO THAT THEY COULD DO YOU KNOW. FIRST TIME AROUND THEY COULD DO A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENTS. AND THEN A AND THEN ANOTHER ANOTHER REASON IS COST COST EFFECTIVENESS I MEAN I'VE BEEN IN INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER AT THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND ONLY I'VE USED THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS THIRD PARTY VENDORS. AND FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS PERSPECTIVE I AGAIN SAY THAT THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT WAS MORE MORE PROVIDED MORE VALUE FOR WHAT WHAT. WE GOT. WHAT WE PAID FOR. THANK YOU. HI I JUST. HAD ONE OTHER THING IF. DID YOU DO LOOK AT THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE AUDITOR. MENTIONED IS THAT THE ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BE DONE THE- NO LESS THAN EVERY THREE YEARS ARE YOU ARE YOU ON THE LINE I KNOW IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND MATURITY THE DEPARTMENT IS BUT ARGUED. MORE INCLINED TO A TWO YEAR ASSESSMENT OR TO A THREE YEAR ASSESSMENT WERE BIRD MOST OF YOUR DEPARTMENTS FALL. DESCRIBE WHAT OUR CURRENT PRACTICE HAS EVOLVED TO AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE ACTUALLY AND AGAIN I MAYBE THIS IS A CLARIFICATION WE CAN GET FROM THE AUDITOR THAT THE ASSESSMENT VERSUS THE HIGH RISK AUDIT. BECAUSE THE ASSESSMENT THE WAY WE CALL IT IS REALLY THE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENT IS WHAT MILITARY AT A TO PROVIDE FOR OTHER THIRD PARTY VENDOR IS MORE OF A PENETRATION TESTING VERY TACTICAL AND TECHNICAL WHAT TYPE OF SUSSMAN WE DO HAVE THOSE BEING AS- AS- YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON EVERY TWO YEARS. FOR THE ENTITIES ARE UNDER OUR PURVIEW IN ADDITION TO THAT DOLE WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND DID CHANGE FROM A THREE YEAR CYCLE TO MORE OF A FOUR YEAR CYCLE WILL BE CALLED HIGH RISK AUDIT. THE AUDIT IS MORE ON THE POLICY COMPLIANCE AS OPPOSED TO TECHNICAL COMPLIANCE BUT EVEN THOUGH WE WENT FROM A THREE YEAR TO A FOUR YEAR THAT'S WITH A EVERY TWO YEAR WAS STILL WHAT IS CALL A TOUCH BASE AUDIT. WHICH WOULD BE MEANS IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT AFTER DEPARTMENT RECEIVED THEIR- ASSESSMENT REPORT THE ANY TIME TO REMEDIATE SO CABIN A TWO AND A THREE YEAR SOMETIMES DOESN'T GIVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THESE DEPARTMENT TO REMEDIATE THE FINDING. SO WE MOVED TO FOR YEARS HOWEVER IN THE FOUR YEAR CYCLE. YOU KNOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND YEAR WE DO DO A I AM ONLY OF TOUCH BASES TO WRITE A CHECK IN YES I CANNOT. IT IS A LIGHTWEIGHT ECONOMIC LIGHT WEIGHT LIGHT LIGHT WENT ON. SO THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO HAVE CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT SO DIED THEY'RE NOT BEING THEY FEEL LIKE. THEY ARE AN ISLAND ON THEIR OWN IN TERM OF ACHIEVING OR WE MEDIATE A FINDING. AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE YOU KNOW MADE HERSELF AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION TO THE- A SECOND YOUR CHECK IN AND THEN THE FOURTH YOUR AUDIT. THROUGHOUT THE FOUR YEAR THERE'S ALSO ADVISORY SERVICES THE ARE. THE ARE PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WHEN THEY HAVE QUESTION OR THE OR THEY NEED HELP TO HOW TO. REMEDIATE CERTAIN THINGS WE ALSO. AT SAID DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. EITHER FOR THIS PANEL FOR THE PREVIOUS PANEL. SO IF THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK OUR PANELISTS FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY. I'LL KUDOS TO CDT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE COMMENT BY THE AUDITOR PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENTS AT C. T. HAS MADE OVER THE YEARS. ARE LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN I ALSO REMEMBER THE TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT WHICH I. A SPELL LOT OF TIME STUDYING AND I ALSO REMEMBER THE SUBSEQUENT HEARING THE OVERSIGHT HEARING. WAS NOT AS NICE I GUESS TO PUT IT MILDLY BUT I THINK CD CITY HAS. ON MAY TREMENDOUS TRIED OVER THE YEARS ALONG WITH THE THREE CORE. ARMED PARTNERS I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY. THE THREE OTHER OF COURT PARTNERS YES. AND GAL CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. ALSO CHP SO KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU. AGAIN LET ME JUST AT SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS. THE REPORT AND THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY COMPLETELY VALIDATE CONCERN SAID MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE HAD REGARDING THE INFORMATION SECURITY ON OF. A REPORT NON REPORTING ENTITIES HOWEVER SOME OF THESE ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO THROW ALL OUR LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS WITH WHAT SEEMS TO BE A FUNDAMENTALLY TERRITORIAL. ARGUMENT THEY DON'T WANT CITY T. TO INFRINGE ON THEIR INHERENT CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY. AND THERE ANY FOR CONFIDENTIALITY IF THEY WERE TO SUBMIT TO CDT STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS. WELL I DO UNDERSTAND IT DESIRE TO OF FOR INDEPENDENCE AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE I CAUTION AGAINST SO HAVING SUCH AN ATTITUDE WHEN IT COMES TO AN ISSUE AS IMPERATIVE. ALL TO THE SUCCESS AND SECURITY OF OUR STATE AND OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO AND TRUST US WITH. THEIR INFORMATION RESPECTFULLY MANY OF THESE OFFICES HAVE CORE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE WHOLLY SEPARATE FROM THE AREA OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY. HELLO MISTER ENSURE THAT NO ENERGY ACROSS THE STATE A LACKS THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IN FOCUS THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY IN SETTING APPROPRIATE STATEWIDE STANDARDS. IN ASSESSING READINESS AGAINST ATTACKS. I AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE STATE REALLY NEEDS TO CONTINUE STRENGTHENING WHAT HAS BEEN AN INCREASINGLY COLLABORATIVELY L. APPROACH. WHEN IT COMES TO INFORMATION SECURITY AND ALSO CYBERSECURITY. AGAIN OF OUR CORE CYBERSECURITY PARTNERS CD T. O. U. S. CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT AND C. H. P. R. HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB. SO I BELIEVE THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT A SUPPORTS THAT CONCLUSION ICE AS I STATED EARLIER. ALL BUT THREE SO ONLY SO MUCH HOW COOL PARTNERS CAN DO WITH INCOMPLETE INFORMATION AND IF WE WANT TO GIVE OUR STATE THE BEST CHANCE OF PROTECTING ITSELF. AND CONSTITUENTS AGAINST ANY INCREASING AND NEW THREATS IN CYBER SECURITY WE HAVE TO INTEREST AND SURE OF STATES CORPS CYBERSECURITY EXPERTS. ARE ACTS ARE ALREADY COOLEY A POWER TO DO SO. OF COURSE I RECOGNIZE THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET SOLUTION TO INSULATE OKAY OURSELVES IN THE MODERN WORLD HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT WE CAN INCREASE OUR DETECTION CAPABILITIES IMPROVE. IMPROVE OUR RESPONSES AND ALSO MEDICAID THE HARMS. ALL I THINK THE FIRST STEP SO HAVE TO BE CENTERED ON COMPLETE INFORMATION GATHERING CONDUCTING REGULAR ASSESSMENTS ACROSS ALL STATE ENTITIES. AND ALSO IMPLEMENTING UNIFORM STANDARDS ACROSS THE STATE TO REDUCE THE CHANCES OF A BAD ACTOR. EXPLOITING THE WEAKNESS OF ONE ENTITY TO PREACH OTHERS. A TO THAT AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE CLOSE ANY GAPS AND PROVIDE CD T. AND THE OTHER CORE CYBERSECURITY PARTNERS. WITH AS COMPLETE AS A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE WITH RESPECT TO INFORMATION SECURITY AND OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND HOPEFUL THAT THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH THAT THE RIGHT. SOLUTION PARTICULARLY AFTER TODAY'S HEARING SO WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO. ARMS BAZAR WHEN IF SHE HAS ANY CONCLUDING.
