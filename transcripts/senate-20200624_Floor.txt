ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AN ACT RELATING TO GET MEANT PREFERENCES SENATOR MITCHELL THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING COLLEAGUES. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOTED THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF MISINFORMATION WHENEVER THE TOPIC OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS BROUGHT UP. SO I WANT TO FRAME OUR CONVERSATION TODAY IN SOME BASIC FACTS. ACCORDING TO DATA PROVIDED BY CALTRANS DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND EARLY NINETIES WHEN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS WERE WIDELY UTILIZED AWARDS TO BUSINESSES OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN ROSE TO A HIGH OF 28% IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO OH NINE AWARDS FAILED TO UNDER 10% BY NINETEEN NINETY NAY. AND HAVE NEVER RECOVERED. A DISPARITY STUDY PUBLISHED IN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. WELL THE SAYS TO COMPARE THE RATES OF DISPARITY FOR FEDERAL AND STATE CALTRANS AWARDS. GIVEN THE CALTRANS STILL MANAGES A FEDERAL EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM YOU WOULD EXPECT A MODEST DISPARITY BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS. IN ACTUALITY THE DISPARITY RATE BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS IS TWO TO THREE TIMES HIGHER FOR STATE AWARDS. COLLEAGUES THERE IS CLEARLY REDUCED OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES THAT. THROUGH THE DATA CAN BE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO OH NINE. THE DISPARITIES ARE FELT EVEN DEEPER IN HIGHER EDUCATION PARTICULARLY THE UC SYSTEM WIENER ACCORDING TO THE DATA. FROM THE EDUCATION TRUST WES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE TWELFTH GRADE IN A ROMAN OF BLACK AND LET NEXT STUDENTS. 6% AND 53% EFFECTIVELY. YET THE UC NEW FRESHMEN ROMAN FOR THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN WAS 4% BLACK AND 25% LET NEXT A STARK DIFFERENCE. AS YOU GO BACK YEAR BY YEAR YOU SEE A SIMILAR TREND THAT IS TRACED BACK TO THE YEARS FOLLOWING PASSAGE OF PROP TWO OH NINE. IN FACT THOSE NUMBERS IN TWENTY NINETEEN- UP SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE FIRST. DECADE AFTER THE PASSAGE INTO A NINE WHEN DOLE'S NUMBERS WERE HALF BUT THEY ARE TODAY. AGAIN IN ORDER TO BRACKET OUR DISCUSSION OF A CA FIVE I WANT US TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF ITS NECESSITY. FOR NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE HAS BLINDED OUR LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS TO THEBAY AREA AIR SPACE BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. NOT A COLOR BLIND. IN ONE THE COLLECTIVE ACTIONS WE HAVE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD REPRESENT AN URGENT CALL FOR SYSTEMIC CHANGE AND IT'S TIME FOR A NEW GENERATION OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS THE STAND UP. AN OLD TIME ON THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT'S FAIR AND JUST AND WHAT EQUITY LOOKS LIKE FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. WE CANNOT SOLVE PROBLEMS WE CHOOSE NOT TO SEE. I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPOT FOR A FEE A FIVE. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT ON I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A CA FIVE. CALIFORNIA IS A VERY PROGRESSIVE STATE AND WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF BEING AHEAD OF THE CURVE ON MANY MANY PROGRESSIVE CHANGES. UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER FROM TIME TO TIME CALIFORNIA LEADS IN A BAD WAY IN A REGRESSIVE WAY IN A WAY THAT HARMS. JUSTICE AND EQUITY AND UFORTUNATELY REPEATEDLY IN OUR CONSTITUTION I'M PROP TWO OH NINE HAPPENED IN A CONTEXT IN CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THIS STATE HAS INSERTED. VERY REGRET OF AND AT TIMES RACIST XENOPHOBIC HOMOPHOBIC PROVISIONS INTO OUR CONSTITUTION THESE ARE SCARS ON OUR CONSTITUTION CALIFORNIA. HIM FIFTY. BUT IN ORDER THIRTY FOUR WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO UNDER MY PUBLIC HOUSING TO KEEP BLACK PEOPLE ON LOW INCOME PEOPLE OUT OF WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS. CALIFORNIA DID IT BY IN. PROP ONE EIGHTY SEVEN TO SEND A POWERFUL AND I GET A MESSAGE THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT TO CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA DID IT BY PASSING CROP AIDS WHAT SIGNAL TO MY COMMUNITY THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THAT WE AS WELL WE'RE NOT FULL CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA DID IT BY PASSING PROP TWO OH NINE THE SIGNALED A CALIFORNIA NOT FULLY COMMITTED TO WRITING PAST WRONGS WRONGS GOING BACK HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND I CALIFORNIA WAS NOT TRULY COMMITTED. TO EMBRACING DIVERSE MAKES THIS STATE WHAT IT IS. PROP TWO OH NINE LIGHT PROPERTY LIKE ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR LIGHT PROP ONE EIGHTY SEVEN IS A TRUE DEEP SCAR ON OUR STATE AND ON OUR STATE CONSTITUTION IT IS TIME TO REMOVE THAT'S- TO REPEAT PROP TWO OH NINE. AND I URGE AN IDOL ONE EIGHT FIVE THANK YOU. SENATOR GONZALEZ. SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AC A FIVE OUR DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH AND TO IGNORE THAT WOULD BE TO IGNORE THE VERY PEOPLE WE'RE HERE TO SERVER PRESENT. WHEN WE TAKE THIS VOTE TODAY WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN. WERE THE ONES WHO WERE IMPACTED BY PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE. AND THAT WE AS A STATE ARE BETTER. WHEN WE AND OUR CLASSROOMS. OUR WORKPLACES AND OUR LEADERS REFLECT WHAT ARE COMMUNITIES LOOKED LIKE. AS A BODY WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY SET AN EXAMPLE AND MUST TAKE THIS NECESSARY STEP FORWARD TOGETHER AS A UNIT. TODAY WE DECIDE IF THE VOTERS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEIR VOICE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THE BORDERS SHALL COME TOGETHER AND SPEAK. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO GIVE OUR CONSERVE OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT CHANCE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. ON A CD FIVE THANK YOU. SENATOR HERTZBERG. MADAM PRESIDENT. YEAH ME ON. ONE OF THE GREAT JUSTICES OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WAS A GENTLEMAN. BY THE NAME OF THURGOOD MARSHALL. WANTED TO THE SUPREME COURT BY PRESIDENT JOHNSON. FORTY TWO YEARS AGO ALMOST TO TODAY. ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. HE OPINED IN A VERY FAMOUS CASE CALLED THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA VERSUS BAKI. HE AGREED IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART I JUST WANT TO READ TWO PARAGRAPHS THAT I FIND. FOUND IS IT INSPIRATION THOSE DAYS AS A YOUNG LAW STUDENT AND TODAY I WAS A SENATOR ON THIS. HE SAID. I AGREE WITH THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT ONLY IN SO FAR AS PERMITS THE UNIVERSITY TO CONSIDER THE RACE OF AN APPLICANT IN MAKING ADMISSIONS DECISIONS IF YOU REMEMBER THIS CASE INVOLVED MEDICAL SCHOOL THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. I DO NOT. BE THE PETITIONS ADMISSIONS PROGRAM VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION. FOR IT MUST IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT DURING THE MOST OF THE PAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS THE CONSTITUTION AS INTERPRETED BY THE COURT DID NOT. DID NOT PROHIBIT THE MOST INGENIOUS AND PERVASIVE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS NOW WHEN THE STATE TAX TO REMEDY THE EFFECTS OF THAT LEGIT BECAUSE SEE OF DISCRIMINATION. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE SAME CONSTITUTION STANDS AS A BARRIER. HE WENT ON GOING TO THE HISTORY IN A VERY ELOQUENT WAY AND ENDED WITH ONE OTHER QUOTE THAT I WANT TO USE AND I WILL STAND DOWN AS SOON AS I FIND THAT. HE SAYS. IN LIGHT OF MY GLASSES. THREE MEN PRESIDENT. IN LIGHT OF THE STORY HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION AND IT'S DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON THE LIVES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS BRING THE AFRICAN AMERICANS TO THE MAINSTREAM OF AMERICAN LIFE SHOULD BE A STATE INTEREST OF THE HIGHEST ORDER TO FAIL TO DO SHOW IS TO ENSURE THAT AMERICAN WILL FOREVER REMAIN DIVIDED SOCIETY. TRUTHIS THE TRUTH AND THAT IS THAT THERE ARE. THE POINTS MADE BY THE- BUDGET CHAIR TODAY AND THAT THIS. IN THIS VERY CHALLENGING HISTORY THAT WE HAVE FACE TO IN THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THIS. REMAINS THE SAME UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE THAT THURGOOD MARSHALL TO ABOUT FORTY TWO YEARS AGO. AND WE TODAY SHOULD AMEND OUR CONSTITUTION TO CONFORM ACCORDING. I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS- I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACA FIVE- AND I COMPLIMENT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR HER PASSIONATE COMMENTS AND APPROPRIATE COMMENTS. IN EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WHEN I WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE STATE ASSEMBLY I MET WITH A GENTLEMAN NAMED JOE HOPKINS. WHO WROTE THE LOCAL BLACK NEWSPAPER IN MY DISTRICT STILL GOING STRONG AFTER FORTY YEARS. HE TOOK OFF HIS EDITORIALS OVER THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF HIS PAPER VITAMIN A BOOK. AND I READ THE BOOK AND EVERY THREE MONTHS. THERE WAS A REOCCURRING THEME IS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIALS. WHY DOES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH SUCH A RICH EDUCATION HISTORY. DO MORE FOR BLACK STUDENTS. WHY DOES IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY. DO MORE FOR BLACK HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS AND MAKE THEM FEEL WELCOME. ON ITS CAMPUSES ANYONE ON FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS HIS PLEASE. FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO MORE. FOR BLACK STUDENTS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE SO I SAT DOWN WITH THEM AND I SAID. IF I GO TO THE ASSEMBLY I WANT TO DO SOMETHING I WANT TO HELP I READ YOUR BOOK. AND YOUR XIN NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED IN SO. MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE VERY FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I AUTHORED. WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WAS A RESOLUTION THE CALL ON THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO DO MORE ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS. WITH HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. SOMETHING MISTER BRADFORD TALKS FONDLY ABOUT HIS IN MY DISTRICT THERE'S A- STRONG COMPLEMENT OF HBCU GRADUATES BOARD MEMBERS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MORE HOUSE. THE BOARD LOSING THAN OTHERS A PROUD HISTORY OF HBCUS BUT THERE'S ALSO A YOUNG COHORT OF STUDENTS WHO WANT TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY WRESTLE WITH THAT AND I SAID WELL LET'S DO ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS WELL. WHAT I RUN INTO. PROP TWO OH NINE. WHEN YOU GET ALLEGE COUNCIL OPINION THAT SAID IF YOU DO AN ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU CAN GET AROUND PROP TWO ONE NINE THE FACT THAT WE HAD THE INTELLECTUAL LIES. ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS IN A WAY. TO GET AROUND THE ROADBLOCK TO HELP YOUNG STUDENTS GET AN EDUCATION. IN AND OF ITSELF. IS A PROBLEM. AND THEN I WAS HAZED ON THE FOUR. WHEN I PRESENTED THIS RESOLUTION. WHY WOULD WE DO THIS. WHY WOULD WE DO THIS. WHY WOULD WE CREATED ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA NINETEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. DIDN'T GO UP ON THE BILL ON CONCURRENCE TWELVE SENATORS LAID OFF. AC ARE TWENTY ONE AT THE TIME IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. SO HERE WE ARE IT'S TIME TO RECTIFY THAT. DURING OUR DISCUSSIONS WE BROUGHT TOGETHER BLACK BUSINESS LEADERS. BLACK HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS COMMUNITY LEADERS AND WE HAD A DISCUSSION OF WHAT CAN WE DO. AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE PARENTS WERE SHOCKED WHEN WE HEARD HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS SAY. WHY WOULD I WANT TO GO TO UCLA. THEY DON'T WANT ME. WHY WOULD I WANT TO GO TO BERKELEY. I'M COMFORTABLE ON THAT CAMPUS AS I DON'T SEE PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME. AND SO FOR A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. TO MAKE A SEGMENT OF THE PUBLIC FEEL ON WELCOME AND NOT WANTED. AND HAVE EIGHTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS FEEL THAT WAY. THAT WAS A PROBLEM I WILL SAY TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE ALMOST EVERY STUDENT IN HIGH SCHOOL SAID THE ONLY YOU SEE I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN GOING TO IS RIVERSIDE BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST DIVERSE CAMPUS. THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT BUT THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS KNEW THAT. BECAUSE THE WORD HAD FILTERED DOWN WHICH CAMPUS WAS THE MOST. DIVERSE FRIEND SO WE ULTIMATELY CREATED AN ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE H. B. C. USE AND THE HISTORICALLY BLACK OLLEGE ACTUALLY HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE CREATED A SUMMER FELLOWSHIP WHICH IS IN ITS ELEVENTH YEAR TO CREATE A PIPELINE INTO MBA PROGRAMS ON MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES PUT IT IN THE BUDGET. THREE YEARS AGO US ALL AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THIS ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP. WHEN WE FIRST STARTED DOWN THAT ROAD WE GOT PUSHED BACK FROM THE SENATE WELL WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS. OF H. B. C. USE EVERYBODY HAD A REASON NOT TO DO IT. AND SO I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A CA FIVE TODAY. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A REASON TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE DECADES OF REASONS TO KNOW WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. OUR STUDENTS SHOULD BE WELCOME ON THESE CAMPUSES AND OUR ADMISSIONS OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED. TO ACCEPT OUR DIVERSE POPULATION THAT DIVERSE POPULATION THRIVES IN A OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION INSTITUTION SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT ACA FIVE AND COMPLEMENT ITS AUTHOR AND IT'S FEEL DROPPED. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU OF. CITING OFFICER IN MEMBERS I WANT TO. REITERATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM- LOOKING ON TO GET THE CORRECT JUST A. DESCRIBE SO I HIT I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED ON THE FLOOR AND PREVIOUS OUTSIDE TALKS THAT I. GREW UP IN A VERY SEGREGATED TOWN EVERYONE PRETTY MUCH LOOKS LIKE ME FOR THE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE COVENANTS IN THE TOWN AND PEOPLE CAN LIVE THERE ANYWAY. SO WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE AT UC BERKELEY IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES I WAS A VERY. IT WAS IT WAS A NEW WORLD FOR ME BECAUSE THERE WERE PEOPLE OF EVERY CLASS IN COLOR. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF BLACK STUDENTS AT CAL AT THAT TIME. AND OVER TIME BY STATE I GOT BOTH MY DEGREES AT UC BERKELEY AND I THEN ENDED UP WORKING ON THE CAMPUS SO I WAS ON THAT CAMPUS ON A DAILY BASIS FROM THE EARLY SEVENTIES UNTIL THE MID NINETIES HAND OVER THAT TIME PERIOD I SAW A REMARKABLE CHANGE IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE CAMPUS WHERE IT IS- IT DID NOT REFLECT WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE NOW I CAN'T FULLY DESCRIBE THAT ALL OF THE STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO WERE THERE. WHEN I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES FELT. FULLY WELCOME TO IN FOLEY- INCREASED BUT I CERTAINLY OBSERVED OVER TIME THAT LESS AND LESS ESPECIALLY BLACK STUDENTS FELT AT ALL COMFORTABLE AT UC BERKELEY BECAUSE INEVITABLY THEY WOULD BE THE ONLY BLACK STUDENT IN THE CLASS IN A PARTICULAR COURSE WERE THE ONLY BLACK STUDENT IN THEIR MAJOR UNLESS THEY WERE IN ETHNIC STUDIES MAJOR FOR EXAMPLE. YOUR THE ONLY BLACK STUDENT IN THEIR PARTICULAR HOUSING. SETTING THAT IS NOT RIGHT AND I ALSO WATCHED WHERE THE DIVERSITY OF FACULTY HUGELY CHANGED HUGELY CHANGED. NOT TO A GOOD END AND NOT REFLECTING THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR STATE. SO IT'S BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN MY TOWARDS THE END OF MY TERMS IN THE ASSEMBLY THIS ISSUE WAS BROUGHT UP THAT WE SHOULD RE LOOK AT TWO NINE AND WE SHOULD PUT IT ON THE BALLOT AND GET RID OF TWO NINE. AND IT WAS ISSUE USING THE TERM DIFFICULT IS TO IS- IT IS A NICE WAY TO DESCRIBE THE AT THE- PAIN FOR CONVERSATIONS THAT OCCURRED AROUND THIS SUBJECT AT THAT TIME. BUT I AM VERY VERY HAPPY THAT WE HAVE. THAT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THAT DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SINCE THEN I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE STILL RESIDENTS CALIFORNIA WHO MAY NOT SEE THE VALUE. THE IMPORTANCE IN THE ESSENTIAL NESS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BUT I THINK I THINK THAT SO MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE NOW SEEN THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN SERVED BY THAT BY TWO NINE WE HAVE NOT BEEN SERVED. AND I WAS VERY VERY PROUD THAT THE ENTIRE UC SYSTEM. GOT BEHIND AND SUPPORTS THE REPEAL OF TWO NINE AND I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. SENATOR WES SO. THANK YOU MEMBERS YOU KNOW PROP TWO OH NINE I REMEMBER THIS VERY CLEAR WHEN THIS INITIATIVE WAS PUT FORWARD THIS IS WILL SOMETHING THAT GOT ME ACTIVATED CIVIC KLAY WORKING ON A CAMPAIGN OPPOSES MEASURE AND I WAS VERY DEEPLY SADDENED WHEN OF CAST AND LESS MORE SAID AND WHEN I HEARD THAT- 60% OF THE LATINO COMMUNITY ACTUALLY VOTE FOR IT WHEN I SPOKE TO BE SUPPORTED. HE DIDN'T UNDER WHAT PROP TWO OH NO WASN'T. ABOUT THEY SAID ALL THIS IS ABOUT GETTING THE BEST TENANTS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND- BUT WE WERE ALREADY DOING THAT. WE WERE ALREADY DOING THAT SO PROP TWO OH NINE DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. PROP TWO NINE JUST BOND. THE HANDS. OF OUR UNIVERSITIES. TO PROVIDE DIVERSITY ON THE CAMPUSES WHAT HAS RESULTED SINCE PROP TWO OH NINE. CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ARE THE LEAST DIVERSE IN THE COUNTRY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LIST OF THE TOP FIFTEEN MOST DIVERSE CAMPUSES. THEY'RE NOT IN CALIFORNIA NOT A SINGLE ONE OR ARE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES BUT WE DO HAVE STANFORD ON THERE WE HAVE U. S. C. ON THERE WE HAVE PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE DOING A BETTER JOB. OF INTERGROUP THEIR CAMPUSES THEN ARE VERY PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF. BECAUSE WHEN PROP TWO OH NINE WAS ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA GUESS WHAT HAPPENED. VICE LIKE A SICKNESS PROP TWO NIGHT AFFECTED OTHER STATES YOU HAVE STATES LIKE. LIKE WASHINGTON IN MICHIGAN AND THE BRASS CAN ERA ZONA OKLAHOMA FLORIDA NEW HAMPSHIRE FOLLOWED CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT TO THEIR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HEY WE THINK ABOUT RACISM WE USUALLY DON'T THINK ABOUT THOSE STATES WE THINK ABOUT THE SOUTHERN BELTS THAT. THOSE HAVE THESE THESE POLICIES YOU WOULD EXPECT THEY WOULD BUT THEY DON'T. SO WHY ARE WE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHY DO WE DISCRIMINATE ARE AGAINST OUR OWN PEOPLE MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE WHY WE WERE FOR WHY WERE WE FIRST BECAUSE WERE THE MOST EVER STATE. AND WE HAD ELEMENTS IN THE STATE THE SOUGHT TO ADVANCE THESE POLICIES TO KEEP OUT THECERTAIN PEOPLE OUT OF OUR UNIVERSITIES AND YOU KNOW WHAT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE. AND IT'S JUST MORALLY WRONG THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THELEGISLATURE SHOULD STANDING BY. NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONDONE WHAT ARE WE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SAYING WE DON'T WANT GIVE. DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE THAT ARE POOR THAT WERE RAISED FOR THAT COME FROM. THE POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS IT OFTEN ARE PLAGUED BY HAVING THE WORST SCHOOLS. THAT OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY GET A QUALITY EDUCATION TO GO UNIVERSITIES YOU. ARE ARE CUT OUT OF EVERY SINGLE LEVEL OF OPPORTUNITY IN OUR STATE YOU'RE GONNA LIVE IN THE POOREST COMMUNITIES WITH THE MOST CONTAMINATION WITH THE WORST SCHOOLS WITH NO PARKS. AND NO HOPE TO GO TO A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY THAT OFFERS YOU THE MOST AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY WE CELEBRATE. THERE ARE UNIVERSITIES ARE SOME OF THE BEST. NUMBER WHAT I WANT TO KNOW THE NUMBER ONE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY UCLA. CURRENTLY RANKED NUMBER ONE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY YET. IT'S A RECORD ON DIVERSITY. IS SAD I'M ASHAMED OF IT. AND I WANT TO DO SOMETHING I WOULD DO MORE. TO DIVERSIFY MARC ALMOND MATER I WANT MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION WHY WOULD WE BE AGAINST THAT LAYS IN GERMAN. WHY DO WE HAVE A POLICY TYING THE HANDS. OF THE LEADERS OF OUR UNIVERSITIES TO THE SIDE. YOU KNOW I MENTIONED THE OTHER DAY. BUT I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATURE WEIGHING IN ON DECISIONS THAT PERTAIN TO OUR UNIVERSITIES AND WE WEIGH IN AND SAY WE WANT TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN MORE EDUCATION THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF. BUT WHEN WE WEIGH IN. AND THE PUBLIC WAYS AND- I'M CREATING OBSTACLES FOR OUR UNIVERSITIES TO EDUCATE THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE WE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF THE- THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD. CLOSER TO WE SHOULD FIGHT. LET THE PEOPLE THAT WE APPOINT TO THESE POSITIONS AND LET THE PEOPLE THAT WE PAY. TO MAKE OUR UNIVERSITY IS THE BEST IN THE NATION THE BEST THE WORLD DECIDE. ON HOW THEY WANNA OF A UP IN A GREAT. THERE UNIVERSITIES WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT THEY WANT TO CREATE. WHETHER THEY WANT PEOPLE OF THE BRING IN PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE FOR OUR DIVERSE BACK BACKGROUND TO REPRESENT OUR STATE ANOTHER LEVELS YOU KNOW WE ARE CREATING VALUES. THERE ARE NOT. APPROPRIATE AND THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION AND HOW WE HAVE BECOME THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMY WE ARE THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMY BECAUSE WERE DIVERSE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN BECAUSE WE HAVE DIPPY FOR FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD OF DIFFERENT VIEWS AND DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VALUES. IN OUR STATE AND IN HUMANITIES WITH GIVES A STRING THAT'S WHAT STRENGTHENS THE FABRIC OF SOCIETY WE ARE SAYING THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT IN OUR UNIVERSITIES AND WE ARE WRONG THIS IS NOT RIGHT LET'S WRITE THIS SHIP LET'S EDUCATE. THE PUBLIC. WHY THEY NEED TO. SUPPORT THIS INITIATIVE MD TEAR DOWN PROP TWO NINE LET'S EDUCATE THEM LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE OUR STATE LET'S DON'T DENY THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE SPANIARDS SO IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE TO THE IMAGE OF OUR STATE. TO THE HEART AND SOUL OF OUR STATE. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WILL DEFINE CALIFORNIA FOR MANY YEARS. AND LET'S STOP HAVING THIS DEBATE. ON ON RACE AND WHO IS. MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN BUT STOP HAVING THAT DEBATE AND LET'S START REACHING OUT TO EVERYBODY AND SAY BE PROUD YOUR CALIFORNIAN CALIFORNIAN VALUES YOU WORK HARD. CHANCE BUT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE SUPPORT THIS MEASURE BUT YOU NIGHT. AS LEGISLATORS HERE I HOPE THAT YOU FEEL. IN YOUR HEART THAT THIS PROP TWO NINE WAS WRONG IN EVERY SENSE IT WAS WRONG TO BIND THE HANDS OF THE LEADERS OF OUR UNIVERSITY TO THAT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO LET'S RIVERSIDE LET'S MAKE IT RIGHT PLEASE VOTE TO SUPPORT THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE THANK YOU. FINISHING THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. MEMBERS RACISM EXISTS DEMOCRAT OF DISCRIMINATION EXISTS THAT'S NO SECRET I'VE EXPERIENCED IT MYSELF I'VE SHARED IT LAST WEEK WHEN WE WERE VOTING ON ETHNIC STUDIES THAT WAS JUST A VERY SMALL EXAMPLE I'VE HAD PEOPLE ASK ME TO CHANGE MY NAME TO ANGLICIZED MY NAME. I'VE HAD YOU KNOW. WE ALL WE ALL HEARD ABOUT KUNG FU AND HOW THE ASIAN AMERICANS ARE TREATED BECAUSE THE COLD IT RIGHT NOW. BUT NONE OF THIS COMPARES TO WHAT WE ALL WITNESSED WITH GEORGE FLOYD. I CONTINUE TO WITNESS AS OUR COUNTRY WAKES UP. TO THIS UGLY REALITY. I STOOD WITH MY COLLEAGUES RECENTLY OUTSIDE THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL TO MEMORIALIZE MISTER FLOYD AND MAKE A CALL TO ACTION. IT WAS I'D LIKE TO THINK ARE OUT OF THE LOS ANGELES CAUCUS IN OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERS FOR ORGANIZING THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND I AM PREPARED TO ENGAGE IN THAT WORK. WE MADE% HISTORY LAST YEAR WITH AB THREE NINETY TO REFORM USED A POLICE FORCE LAWS. AND WE HAVE MORE TO DO. SOME OF THAT S NOT BEING LED BY MISTER GIBSON MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER GIBSON IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING HIS BILL TO BAN THE USE OF CHOKEHOLDS. I SUPPORT THE CSU REQUIREMENT TO MANDATE ETHNIC STUDIES. FOR STUDENTS AND WE STILL HAVE A LOT MORE WORK. BUT EVEN THAT ISN'T A PANACEA. RACISM EXISTS AND SOME OF IT WILL REQUIRE CULTURAL CHANGE. MEMBERS IT WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO OUR COUNTRY AND CALIFORNIA POLITICS IS SUPPORTED THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT THAT PUT IN LAW AT FIRST LAWS SPECIFICALLY TARGETING CHINESE PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF RACE. REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL NINETEEN FORTY THREE. IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT MUCH OF CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY IS REPLETE. WITH ANTI ASIAN RACISM. THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT ONLY ESTABLISH BARRIERS EXCLUSIVELY FOR CHINESE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO PLACE DISCRIMINATORY RESTRICTIONS ON CHINESE LABORS. ALREADY LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES WE ACTUALLY HAD LAWS AT ONE POINT PROHIBITING PUBLIC BODIES FROM EMPLOYING CHINESE AND CALLED UPON THE LEGISLATURE TO PROTECT. THE STATE FROM BURDENS AND EVILS ARISING FROM THEIR PRESENCE. IT WASN'T LONG AGO THAT THERE WAS AN ENTIRE POLITICAL PARTY CREATED AN ORGANIZED AROUND ANTI CHINESE RACISM. IT WAS CALLED THE WORKING MEN'S PARTY OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S FAMOUS SLOGAN WAS THE CHINESE MOSCOW. THEIR BIGGEST LEADER AND ADVOCATE DENISE TURNEY INFAMOUSLY PROCLAIM CALIFORNIA MUST BE ALL AMERICAN FOR ALL CHINESE WE'RE RESOLVED THAT IT SHALL BE AMERICAN AND ARE PREPARED TO MAKE IT SO. COLLEAGUES THAT RIDICULOUSNESS THAT PARTY LED BY THAT RACES MAN HELD SEATS IN THIS VERY HOUSE. THE VERY INSTITUTION WE'RE SITTING IN AND REPRESENTING TODAY. THAT RACES PARTY VIGOROUSLY SUPPORTED AND PUSH ANTI CHINESE LAWS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS I WON'T READ THROUGH ALL OF THEM. BUT ONE THE SUCCESSFUL IN SIGNED IN THE STATE'S CONSTITUTION WAS A BAN ON PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT FOR THE CHINESE. IT WAS UNDER SECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH THEY SIMPLY ENTITLED CHINESE. KNOWING THIS HISTORY MAKES ME SAD FRANKLY THAT TODAY THIS BILL IS RESCINDING VERY SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL LANGUAGE FOR MORE CONSTITUTION THAT MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEONE FOR ETHNICITY OR RACE IN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC. EMPLOYMENT RACISM IS STILL WITH US AND TWENTY TWENTY IT'S INFURIATING IT'S FRUSTRATING AND IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE SOMETIMES. AND IT'S WHY SO MANY PEOPLE TOOK TO THE STREETS IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMICS. THE PROBLEM WITH THE CA FIVE IS THAT IT TAKES THE POSITION THAT WE MUST FIGHT DISCRIMINATION WITH MORE DISCRIMINATION. MEMBERS THE ANSWER TO DISCRIMINATION IS NOT MORE DISCRIMINATION THE ANSWER IS NOT TO CODIFY IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. THE ABILITY FOR OUR GOVERNMENT AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF RACE SEX SEXUAL ORIENTATION. COLOR ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. THE LANGUAGE OF OUR CONSTITUTION CLOSELY PARALLELS TITLE SEVEN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. IN FACT PROP TWO NINE WITH CALLED THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS INITIATIVE. THE FIRST TWO NIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION TO CONSIDER AN ALLEGED VIOLATION OF TITLE SEVEN CONCLUDED. WHAT IS REQUIRED BY CONGRESS IS THE REMOVAL OF ARTIFICIAL ARBITRARY. AND UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT WHEN THE BARRIER OPERATE INVIDIOUS LEE. TO DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF RACIAL OR OTHER IMPERMISSIBLE CLASSIFICATION. AS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUSTICE JANICE BROWN THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO SIT ON THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT EXPLAINED. HOWEVER IT IS RATIONALIZED A PREFERENCE TO ANY GROUP CONSTITUTES INHERENT INEQUALITY. MOREOVER PREFERENCES FOR ANY PURPOSE ARE ANATHEMA TO THE VERY PROCESS OF DEMOCRACY. LET'S FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY TWENTY. JUST LAST WEEK WE HAD A HISTORICAL SUPREME COURT RULING PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. THIS RECENT DECISION A SIGNIFICANT LEAP TOWARD EQUALITY FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY DECLARED THAT A KEY PROVISION OF TITLE SEVEN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR BARS JOB DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBT WORKERS. IT BARS RUMINATION MEMBERS THAT'S THE POINT OR INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT BRACE AND CELEBRATE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE SEX SEXUAL ORIENTATION COLOR ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN LET'S NOT FORGET THIS BILL IS ELIMINATING A PROHIBITION ON DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX WHICH THE SUPREME COURT JUST DETERMINED ENCOMPASSES THE LGBT COMMUNITY. LET'S READ THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS INITIATIVE OR A. K. A. PROP TWO OH NINE. TWENTY CA WANTS TO JETTISON FROM OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. THE STATE SHALL NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OR GRANT PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO ANY INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP ON THE BASIS OF RACE SEX COLOR ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN IN THE OPERATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. PUBLIC EDUCATION OR PUBLIC CONTRACTING WHAT IS SO CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT THIS. HOW DID WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE ARE NOW ADVOCATING FOR DISCRIMINATION IN THE LAW. THE WORDS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION DO NOT APPEAR IN THIS BILL. IT'S ABOUT DISCRIMINATION LEGALIZED DISCRIMINATION. I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM THE PROPONENTS ARE TRYING TO SOLVE AND THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD BE WORKING TO INCREASE THE REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE. UC FRESHMAN ENROLLMENT FOR BLACK AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED. FRESHMAN WOMAN FOR STATIC LATINOS INCREASED BY TWO HUNDRED AND WOMAN IS EQUAL TO WHAT IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. AND HERE'S A RECENT HEADLINE FROM THE LA TIMES YOU SEE ADMITS LARGEST MOST DIVERSE CLASS EVER OF CALIFORNIA FRESHMAN. WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST DIVERSE UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY MEMBERS. KNOWING THIS WHY WOULD WE ALL OF A SUDDEN INJECT RACE INTO OUR ROOM AND PROCESS. SO HOW DO WE REALLY QUALITY. WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR EXISTING SYSTEM AND INSTITUTIONS LET'S LOOK AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS. OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE LETTING DOWN STUDENTS IN SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AREAS OF THE STATE. TOO MANY LOW INCOME MINORITY STUDENTS ARE NOT GETTING THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY GRADES. FOR EXAMPLE. 21% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE'RE CONSIDER PREPARE FOR COLLEGE OR CAREER COMPARED TO FIFTY TWO PERCENT. OF WHITE STUDENTS AND NOT ACCEPTABLE. WE OWE IT TO THE STUDENTS TO PUSH FOR COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL REFORMS AND FUNDING SO ALL OUR STUDENTS ARE PREPARED FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. I'VE FOUGHT FOR SCHOOL REFORM FOR YEARS AND SEVEN PROVING OUR SCHOOLS AND ENSURING KIDS RECEIVE THE BEST EDUCATION POSSIBLE. TOO MANY OF US RESIST CHANGE. NOW IS THE TIME FOR THIS CHANGE. MEMBERS I MENTION IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT WE HAD THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT. IT'S NOT THAT LONG AGO WE HAD LAWS THAT EXPLICITLY HEARD AFRICAN AMERICANS. AND THE LEGACY OF THESE LAWS CONTINUE WITH US. THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN BREAK THIS UP. JUST CONSIDER RIGHT NOW YOUR ZIP CODE IS THE VISIT BECAUSE THE TERMINATION OF HOW GOOD YOUR EDUCATION WILL BE IN SCHOOL. IF THE MOM IN A LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD WANTS TO SEND YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL ACROSS TOWN THAT PROVIDES A BETTER PROGRAM FOR HER CHILD. SHE'S FOR BRIDGE FOR BILLION FROM ALLOWING HER CHILD TO GO TO THAT SCHOOL. WE HAVE DECADES OF LAWS. RIGID INSTITUTIONS AND ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DETERMINE WHERE YOUR ZIP CODE WILL BE BUT NOW YOUR ZIP CODE DETERMINES WHAT EDUCATION YOU WILL GET. THIS IS WRONG AND WE NEED TO FIX IT. EVERY TIME A BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN THIS BUILDING TO PROVIDE MINORITY AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS WITH MORE PUBLIC SCHOOL OPTIONS IT IS RESISTED BY TOO MANY OF US. SOME WHO LIVE IN NICE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH SCHOOLS THEY ARE HAPPY WITH. I HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE AUTHOR OF A CA FIVE. SHE HAS TRIED TO PUSH FOR SCHOOL REFORMS AGAINST MANY ODDS AND DESERVES CREDIT FOR THAT. MEMBERS A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED A PETITION AGAINST THIS BILL. I AM FOR YOU TO LISTEN TO THESE VOICES BEFORE WE PROCEED. THIS BILL IS RACING TO BEAT THE DEADLINE TO GET ON THE BALLOT BUT IT'S WORTH SLOWING DOWN. LET'S WORK TOGETHER OVER THE NEXT YEAR ON HOW WE CAN ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS WITHOUT USING DISCRIMINATION AS THE MAIN TOOL TO FIGHT DISCRIMINATION. I STRONGLY URGE ALL OF US TO VOTE NO OR WITH pTOGETHER TO PROVIDE REAL SOLUTIONS. I UNDERSTAND THE SENSE OF URGENCY BUT LET'S DO THIS RIGHT. THANK YOU. SENATOR DR SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OUR COLLEAGUES ARE RISE NOT ONLY AS A SENATOR BUT AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LET THE ANGLE LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. IN STRONG SUPPORTER BASE A FIVE FIVE BY DOCTOR WEBER. UP TO A NINE WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND A PROHIBITED. RACE AND GENDER CONSCIOUS REMEDIES. THAT RECTIFIED THE UNDER REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. BLACK EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTING AND EDUCATION THESE PROGRAMS WERE DESIGNED NOT TO TAKE SOME PEOPLE'S OPPORTUNITIES AWAY. RATHER IT WAS TO EXPAND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN WERE THEN AND STILL TODAY LARGELY EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOL AND BUSINESS AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO THE HISTORIC AND SYSTEMIC MAIL PREFERENCES AND RACISM. THAT INCLUDED PRO ACTIVE EFFORTS IN STATE HIRING CONTRACTING AS WELL AS EFFORTS BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. TO HELP YOUR PROTECTIVE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS OF COLOR AND BUSINESS OWNERS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO TEN WELL ATTENDED ONE OF THE EXCELLENT UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES ALL OR- GET A CHANCE AT A GOVERNMENT BUSINESS CONTRACT. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE FOR SETTING UP SMALL BUSINESSES FOR SUCCESS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR BUSINESSES OWNED BY WOMEN AND MINORITIES WHO MUST OVERCOME THE LONGSTANDING OBSTACLES THE SUCCESS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR HARD WORK OR THEIR ABILITY TO INNOVATE. THE NINETEEN NINETIES CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE TOP PERFORMING STATES IN TERMS OF CONTRACTING WITH WOMEN AND MINORITY ENTREPRENEURS. IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS DROPPED TO ONE OF THE TWO WORST PERFORMING STATES RELATIVE. TO OUR DIVERSITY PUTTING IT IN COMPANY WITH MUCH LESS RACIALLY DIVERSE STATES LIKE NEBRASKA IN VERMONT. IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR RACE BLIND ADMISSIONS POLICIES THAT SELECT APPLICANTS BASED ON PURPORTEDLY OBJECTIVE METRICS LIKE SAT SCORES OR RECOMMENDATION LETTERS ONLY REINFORCE EXISTING INEQUALITIES. SUCH SYSTEMS AWARD COVETED ENROLLMENT SLOT OR DO. TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD EXPENSIVE TEST PREP COURSES ARE WHO LIVE IN PRIVILEGE THESE APPLICATION FACTORS DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES AND TALENTS THAT MANY STUDENTS OF COLOR OFTEN FROM UNDER UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FACE. CHALLENGES THAT TODAY HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY COLBERT NINETEEN. LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE LARGEST PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND IN THE U. S. ARE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SECOND LARGEST PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT- SERVING MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE FAMILIES IN THE DISTRICT I HAVE ENDURED A JOB LOSS DURING THE PANDEMIC. AS A RESULT MANY WORKING AGE STUDENTS HAD TO LOOK FOR WORK. OR PICK UP MORE HOURS THE JOBS THEY ALREADY HAD BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES NEEDED HELP. COVERING LIVING EXPENSES. THERE IS A REAL FEEL FEAR FEAR THAT FOR SOME OF THOSE KIDS THIS MAY PUSH THEM TO DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THEIR STRUGGLE AND RECOGNIZE THAT ACTIONS NEED TO BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT THEY DO NOT FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM. AND NEVER HAVE THE CHANCE TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. HOW IS IT THAT CALIFORNIA'S STILL OWN ONE OF ONLY EIGHT STATES TO HAVE AN ANTI EQUAL OPPORTUNITY BAND. AND YET IS THE MOST DIVERSE. WITH A CA ON THE BALLOT AND WITH THE VOTERS APPROVAL WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FAIR HIRING PRACTICES FOR WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. SINCE OUR COLLEAGUES I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT HI. AS MANY OTHERS AND THE PRODUCT OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAM AT SAINT MARY'S COLLEGE. THEY SEE A FIVE WILL STRENGTHEN OUR STATE AND WITH THAT I URGE YOUR BIBLE. SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- SENATORS- IS VICE CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS- I'M PROUD TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF ACA FIVE SO WE CAN PUT THIS ISSUE BEFORE THE VOTERS. THIS ISSUE OF FAIRNESS AND THIS ISSUE OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. NOW I WANTED TO FIRST OF ALL SAY THAT THE- MAJORITY OF ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS AND NUMEROUS POLLS SUPPORT ACA FIVE AND AGAIN THE EIGHTY A LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS ALSO SUPPORTS ACA FIVE. AND WHY DO WE SUPPORT ACA FIVE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE COLLEGE APPLICATION PROCESS STRUCTURAL RACISM. STRUCTURAL RACISM INSURED THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT AT THE SAME STARTING POINT. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR TALENT IS EQUALLY TALENTED PEOPLE ARE NOT AT THE SAME PLACE BECAUSE OF STRUCTURAL RACISM. WE NEED THE TOLLS TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED NO WAY THAT CORRECTS FOR THIS FUNDAMENTAL ANY QUALITY. NOW I DO WANT TO I RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE HISTORY OF- DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE P. I. PARTICULARLY THE CHINESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS OUTLINED BY MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM DIAMOND BAR- BUT AFTER THAT I DRAW DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS. FROM THAT HISTORY. THE CURVE IN NINETEEN OUTBREAK IS CERTAINLY REMINDED- THE EIGHTY AYE COMMUNITY ALTHOUGH THE THING MANY OF US HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT NO MATTER HOW. SUCCESSFUL ACCOMPLISHED- COVERED SEEMS THAT WE ARE PART OF THE GREATER SOCIETY THAT WE ARE NOT. THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT US AND THEY DO JUDGE US BY THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS THE SLANT ARISE OTHER PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS. AND FORTY THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL NOW ONLY EXPRESS HATE AND EVEN SOMETIMES VIOLENCE- BUT ALSO AT PEOPLE WILL JUDGE US BUT- FOR DIFFERENT THINGS AS WELL. BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST SHOWED UP WITH BECAUSE OF IT. AND IS MENTIONED THERE WAS A LONG HISTORY OF THIS IS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED BUT I ALSO POINT OUT THAT. FOR THE API COMMUNITY AND I DO I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE PORTIONS OF THE API COMMUNITY WHO DO HAVE CHALLENGES. IN THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS PROCESS SO IT'SA METHODOLOGY THAT ALL API OR DOING FINE FOR GOING TO COLLEGE WE CAN TALK ABOUT. THE DIRECTLY TO THE PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY THE- MAY THIS SOUTHEAST ASIANS- MOM- THESE- FOURTH THAT HAVE MORE CHALLENGES. IN THAT COLLEGE PROCESS BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE. DOING BETTER. IN IN THAT BUT YET. WHEN WE FINISH COLLEGE AND WE GO OUT IN THE WORKPLACE- WE DON'T SEEM TO DO AS WELL IN FACT THE- THIS VERY SENATE WE HAVE A SELECT COMMITTEE ON A TIE FAIRS. WE ACTUALLY HELD A HEARING ON THE GLASS CEILING FOR ATI. BECAUSE WHAT WE'LL SEE IS THAT WELL CERTAIN SUBGROUPS OF THE P. I. COMMUNITY MAYES BE. REPRESENTED ARE WELL REPRESENTED IN CERTAIN PROFESSIONS AND HIGHER EDUCATION AGAIN ONLY SOME SUB SEGMENTS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT UPPER MANAGEMENT AND COMPANIES OR PROFESSIONS RIGHT EVEN MY OWN PROFESSION OF MEDICINE AND A PHYSICIAN YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU START LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT CHAIRS AND THE DEANS AND YOU DON'T FIND A WHOLE LOT OF A. B. I. UP THERE IN FACT THERE ARE NO ATI MEDICAL SCHOOL DEANS. IN THE UNITED STATES. THINK ABOUT THAT. ALL RIGHT- YOU HAVE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY SOME MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN US AND- SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WELL REPRESENTED- BUT WE SAW THAT THIS IS ALSO THE CASE AND LAW IN TECHNOLOGY LOT OF API ENGINEERS ON THE BOTTOM RUNGS SOMEHOW THEY DON'T SEEM TO GET PROMOTED. AND I DON'T THINK. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALENTED ENOUGH. RIGHT I DON'T THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALENTED ENOUGH TO DO SO MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE IS AT PLAY AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY THE BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITY HAVE NOTICED AS WELL NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND SO IF WE WHAT COMES THE ACA FIVE IT'S GREAT TO TALK ABOUT A QUOTE UNQUOTE COLOR BLIND- PROCESS OR SOCIETY BUT WE KNOW IT'S- NOT COLOR BLIND IT'S BLINDNESS TOWARDS STRUCTURAL RACISM. AND THAT DOES NOT BENEFIT OUR STATE AND CERTAINLY DOESN'T BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL ALL JOIN TOGETHER. THE ON THE SENATE FLOOR TO GIVE THE VOTERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS VERY ISSUE. SO WE CAN HAVE THIS DEBATE IN THE STATE WE CAN HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. OUT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEEDTHE TOOLS. TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THIS ONGOING PROBLEM A STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. AND IF. THE FOR THE EIGHTY EIGHTY AYE COMMUNITY PARKS THE PORTIONS THAT OPPOSE THIS BILL AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE ARE SOME WHO HAS COME OUT AND SAY THEY'RE OPPOSED. I WOULD SAY TO THEM IS THAT LOOK AT YOUR OWN LOOK AT HISTORY LOOK EVEN YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES AND WE CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW RACE. AS AFFECTED EVEN YOUR OWN LIVES. AND YOUR OWN OPPORTUNITIES. THEN HOW ARE WE GOING TO CREATE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING YOURSELVES AND WITH THAT HIGHER AN AYE VOTE ON A CA FIVE THANK YOU. SENATOR WIECKOWSKI. MAN THE SPEAKER MADAM CHAIR. AND PRESIDENT I'LL GET IT RIGHT THIS THIS ISSUE AC FIVE IS BEEN PASSIONATELY CONSTITUTIONALLY EMOTIONALLY DEBATED IN MY IN MY DISTRICT AND I FEEL COMPELLED THIS AFTERNOON TO GET UP AND AFFIRMATIVELY STATE MY SUPPORT FOR A CA FIVE- I WAS A YOUNG STUDENT WHEN THE BACK POCKET DECISION. CAME DOWN ERA WHEN PROP TWO OH NINE WAS PASSED HI I PERSONALLY FELT ASHAMED OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO SAID CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO HAVE THIS DEBATE MY GOD IF WE CAN'T DO IT IN TWENTY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY WITH EVERYTHING GOING AROUND IN THE STATE IN IN OUR COUNTRY TO HAVE THIS DEBATE IN OUR VILLAGES IN OUR TOWNS AT OUR CHURCHES. INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL RACISM IF THIS IS NOT THE TIME. WE'LL NEVER IT'S NEVER GET A COPY I THINK WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO OH NINE. WE SAW AND IT'S MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT IT A REAL- RACIAL DISPARITIES INCREASE IT'S BEEN TWO DECADES WE JUST CAN'T PRETEND THAT IT'S NOT HAPPENING. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION PITCH TOWARDS EQUALITY IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS CORRECTING THE STRUCTURAL- HAS. RACISM AND IT'S LONG OVERDUE. I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE AN ACA FIVE. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY AS VICE CHAIR OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CAUCUS AND STRONG SUPPORT OF A CA FIVE I'M REALLY SAD THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A DEBATE. ON RACE AND ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE IF NOT DIVERSE MOST DIVERSE STATE IN THIS NATION. ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES IN THE- AND WE'RE STILL HAVING A ISSUE REGARDING RACE WITH A TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF FILL YEAR. BECAUSE OF PROP TOOL NINE WE HAVE FAR FEWER WOMEN WE HOW FAR FEWER MEET MINORITIES IN CORPORATE SEE SWITCH. THAN EVER BEFORE IN THIS STATE. WE HAVE FAR FEW AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS IN COLLEGE BECAUSE OF TWO OH NINE BUT TO SIT HERE AND SAY THAT RACE IS NOT A FACTOR RACE IS A FACTOR IN EVERY BEING THAT WE DO. AND TO SAY THAT WERE COLOR BLIND WE'RE NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT WERE A LOT. STILL THIS AFFORDS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOT SET QUOTAS. BUT TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS OF HIRING REMOVE THE BARRIERS AND EDUCATION REMOVE THE BARRIERS OF OPPORTUNITY. I'VE BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE NINE YEARS AND I'VE LOST TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WE'VE HAD TO INTRODUCE THAT HAD SOME KIND OF SUPPLIER DIVERSITY SOME KIND OF EQUITY AND MAKING SURE CONTRACTING INCLUDES WOMEN MINORITIES WE PUT THAT LANGUAGE IN SB ONE BUYER MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN JOSE. WE PUT IT IN CANNABIS LEGISLATION. SB TWELVE NINETY FOUR THAT I AUTHOR WE PUT IT IN INSURANCE FOR OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE IN OUR CHURCH COMMISSION TO MAKE SURE MINORITIES ARE AT THE TABLE WE'VE DONE IT FOR GENDER. WE'VE DONE IT BECAUSE TOOL NINE IS PREVENTED US FROM HIRING AND ALLOWING FOLKS THE INNER OPPORTUNITIES I CHALLENGE MY WHITE COLLEAGUES. BUT YOU CAN COUNT ON ONE HAND THE NUMBER OF TIMES IF YOU WALKED INTO A ROOM LOCKED INTO AN ORGANIZATION IN YOUR THE ONLY ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FINGERS IN POLLS IN THIS BUILDING THE COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT ME AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA AND WALKED INTO A ROOM AND WE'RE THE ONLY ONE IT LOOKS LIKE CUTS. STARTED WHEN I WAS A BOY SCOUT. SCOUT LEADER CALLED ME DARKIE. IT WAS. WHEN I WAS THE ONLY BLACK DIAL. IT'S EITHER BEING THE ONLY BLACK WHITE WITH SILVER UPRIGHT PIANO THE ONLY BLACK SALES REP. IN MY ORGANIZATION. I KNOW ABOUT DISCRIMINATION I'D LIVE IT EVERY DAY WE LIVE IN THIS BUILDING I CHALLENGE MY NON AFRICAN AMERICAN COLLEAGUES. MANY OF WHOM HAVE NEVER HIRED A BLACK PERSON. AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL. AND THAT'S WHY BUT WHEN YOU COME TO OUR OFFICE WE HAVE GREAT DIVERSITY IN OUR OFFICES. BUT I CHALLENGE MY NINE AFTER AMERICAN COLLEAGUES I KNOW WHO ARE DIFFERENT FROM BERKELEY IS DONE THAT A FEW OTHERS BUT THE MAJORITY HAPPEN AND THE MAJORITY NEVER WILL. BECAUSE WE'RE RATE CONSCIOUS AND EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND I THINK AT SOME POINT HE NEEDS TO AN- WE JUST SAW THIS WEEKEND. IN MARYLAND A MOTHER AND A CHILD A NINE YEAR OLDS SIGN WALK INTO A RESTAURANT THE KID HAD SHORTS ON A JORDAN T. SHIRT. AND SNEAKERS. AND THE WHITE MANAGER THAT NIGHT THAT BLACK MOTHER AND THAT CHILD HE SAID HE WAS NOT DRESSED APPROPRIATE WERE RIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM YOU SAW A WHITE KIA IN THE SAME T. SHIRT AND SHORTS AND TENNIS SHOES AND THEIR JOIN A FAMILY MEAL. SO QUIT LAW TO YOURSELVES AND SEEING RACE IS NOT A FACTOR AGAIN THIS BILL DOES NOT ESTABLISH QUOTAS BUT IT REMOVES THE BARRIERS TO ALLOW US. TO FACTOR THAT IN BECAUSE WE FACTORED IN IN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN THE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY THE BEDROCK OF WHO WE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY IS BASED ON REX. A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE LETTER. BOB IS. A HEARING. ON DIVERSITY IN CORPORATIONS. CALIFORNIA BASED KEPT CORPORATIONS IT WAS ONLY TWO. IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY IT AFRICAN AMERICANS. ON THEIR BOARD A FEW MORE HERE WOMEN BUT THE MAJORITY OF. WHITE MEN WHITE MALE DOMINATED AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY'S ALL ABOUT ME WHITE MALE DOMINATED SO THIS IS A CREATIVE AGAIN NO QUOTAS TO JUST BALANCE IS THE PLAYING FIELD FORTY TWO OTHER STATES HAVE RACE CONSCIOUS ADMISSIONS BE A TO COLLEGE TO EMPLOYMENT WEISS IN CALIFORNIA HOW THAT TOO. I THINK MEMBERS THE TIME WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH IT'S TIME TO DO THE RIGHT THING. IT'S TIME TO END RACISM THAT EXISTING CALIFORNIA TIME AND RACISM THAT EXIST IN THIS BUILDING. SOME THERE AND RACES IN AN EXISTING AMERICA IT'S TIME TO. UNDERSTAND IT RACE AND GENDER ARE FACTORED IN ITS NOTHING WRONG AT LOOKING AT IT WHEN YOU DECIDE TO HIRE WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A HANDOUT BECAUSE WE STILL WANT TO HIRE THE MOST QUALIFIED PERSON. I WAS APPALLED AT THE ARGUMENTS YESTERDAY IN APPROACH ABOUT HOW IT WAS GOING TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEBODY. WE'RE SEEING NO IT DOESN'T IF YOU HAVE A HIGHER GPA THAN THE NEXT PERSON YES YOU SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO COLLEGE WE'RE NOT SEEING SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE TO GO TO COLLEGE. SHOULDN'T GO TO COLLEGE BUT WE'RE SEEING. IF YOU HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO FACTOR IN MINORITIES AND SAY HEY WHY IS THIS PERSON GOING TO COLLEGE. MY COLLEAGUE WAS FROM DIAMOND BAR TALK ABOUT THE UNDER PERFORMANCE OF KIDS TAKE TO TWELVE. AGAIN RACE HAS A WHOLE LOT TO DO WITH THAT. WHICH IS ABOUT. CAN'T GO TO ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT. A BETTER SCHOOL DOWN THE ROAD RACE HAS A WHOLE LOT TO DO WITH IT. SO PUT LINE TO OUR SEE AN ACTING LIKE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY. THIS IS A RIGHT HIS BILL I'M HONORED TO BE A CO AUTHOR. AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A SINGLEPERSON. WHO WOULD VOTE NO ON THIS BECAUSE ALL IT DOES IS ALLOW YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THE DECISION THE RIGHT TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER THEY WANT TO REMOVE THIS OR NOT WE'RE NOT DOING IT HERE ALL WE'RE SEEING IS HERE VOTERS OPPORTUNITY. YOU ALWAYS TALK ABOUT FAIRNESS YOU ALWAYS TALK ABOUT OPPORTUNITY WHY WOULD YOU DENY YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT RIGHT TO MAKE THAT DECISION I RESPECTFULLY UP FOR A VOTE. SENATOR SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. BECAUSE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GO BACK TO WHERE WE NEED TO START ON THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AC EIGHT FIVE WOULD OVERTURN PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE. WHICH SAYS AND I QUOTE. THE STATE SHALL NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OR GRANT PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO ANY INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP. ON THE BASIS OF RACE SEX COLOR. ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN IN THE OPERATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. PUBLIC EDUCATION OR PUBLIC KRON CONTRACTING. IN QUOTE. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAID THAT WE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF PUTTING PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE IN TO PLACE. WHY SHOULD CALIFORNIANS BE SHAME TO PUT INTO A NINE IN PLACE ONE TWO ONE NINE SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT WE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE OR GRANT ANY PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO ANY INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP BASED ON THIS THE BASE BASED ON SEX RACE COLOR ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL NATIONAL ORIGIN. FUNDS REPEALING PROP TWO OH NINE. REMOVES THE PROTECTIONS REPEALING PROP TWO OH NINE REMOVES THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I LOOK AT WHAT WAS SAID IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS NGUYEN- WE WERE LOOKING LISTENING TO MY A GOOD CALLING IT WAS JUST SPEAKING AND HE MADE COMMENTS ABOUT THE COLLEAGUES COMMENTS FROM DIAMOND BAR ABOUT LOW SOCIOECONOMIC SCHOOL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IT'S NOT IT'S A SHAME THAT THE ZIP CODE THAT IS USED IN WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IS THE DETERMINATION. OF THE SCHOOLS THAT THEY WILL ATTEND. THAT IS NOT BECAUSE OF RACE THAT IS BECAUSE THE POLICY SET FORTH IN THIS BUILDING. POLICIES THAT REQUIRE THOSE APPEARANCE IN THOSE LOW SOCIO ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO ATTEND THE POOR PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN THOSE DISTRICTS. IF GOOD POLICY WAS PASSED OUT OF THIS BUILDING IT'S GOOD POLICY WITH PASSED OUT OF THIS BUILDING. THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE WHAT WOULD BE BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN INCLUDING CHARTER SCHOOLS WHERE WE STOOD ON THE STEPS OUTSIDE OF THIS CAPITAL WITH BLACK AND LATINO FAMILIES JUST LAST YEAR. WANTING CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO CAN CHARTER SCHOOLS WE GAVE THEM A PERFORMANCE EDUCATION AND ALLOW THEM TO ACHIEVE THE ABILITY TO GET OUT OF THE SITUATION THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN. IN THESE COMMUNITIES THEY SET UP THERE IN THE BED AND THEY PICKETED AND THEY HELD UP SIGNS FOR YOU NOT TO DEMOLISH OR DESPAIR AND OR TO PRE TELL CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEY ASKED FOR A CHOICE IN THIS BODY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE EVERYONE OF THEM THE- BILL. WOULD NOT GIVE THOSE PARENTS THAT CHOICE WE NEED TO START AT THE LEVEL OF K. THROUGH TWELVE AND GIVING PARENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE BEST SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN. AND NOT MAKE THEM ZIP CODES IN WHICH- LIVING IN. AND BECAUSE OF THE PALM. THAT ARE PASSED IN BUILDING. I LOOK AT WHAT AC FIVE A WILL DO AS WELL WHEN WE LOOK AT CHANGES IN STANDING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT EQUIP STUDENTS WITH THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR FUTURE THOSE POLICIES ARE ALSO RETAILED IN THIS BUILDING. NOT EVERY KID WANTS TO GO TO COLLEGE I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE NOT EVERY STUDENT I HAVE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN IN MY DISTRICT AND EVEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS THAT I HAVE THEIR DAD IN THEIR GRANDPA WAS AUTUMN AND I CAN THESE YOUNG KIDS LEARN ALL THE WAY UP. THAT SHADE TREE MECHANIC RULE AND THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT CARS THEY HAVE NO DESIRE TO GO TO COLLEGE THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A TRADE OR TECHNICAL SCHOOL THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO LEARN A TRADE THAT VANCE THEM IN THEIR CAREER. BUT WE IN THIS BUILDING PAST POLICIES THAT STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING. I IMPLORE. TO FOLLOW WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM DIAMOND BAR SAID. THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ABOUT EDUCATION AND HIGHER EDUCATION. THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ABOUT RACISM. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO IT THIS BILL ONLY REPEALS. WHAT THE STATE AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED FOR WHEN THEY STOOD PROUDLY IN VOTED FOR THIS BILL. IT SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE. AGAINST ANYONE. FOR THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. FOR NATIONAL ORIGIN. AGAINST ANYTHING. THEY STOOD IN THE VOTED IN THE SAID WE WILL STAND AS CALIFORNIANS THIS DIVERSE STATE WE WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE FOR THESE REASONS. THAT'S WHAT AB TWO OURS PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE SAYS. AN S. C. FIVE REPEALS TWO OH NINE. IT SETS FORTH BEFORE THE VOTERS TO REPEAL THAT STATUTE. IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND SO RESPECTFULLY I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT AC FIVE IS NOT THE ANSWER AC FIVE IS A CALL TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOW. BUT TO CREATE DISCRIMINATION POLICY BY REMOVING THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALL OF ITS CITIZENS CITIZENS NOT TO DISCRIMINATE IS NOT THE CORRECT WAY TO DO THIS AND I ASKED FOR A NUMBER. CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF I WOULD JUST HAVE TO START WAS SAYING THERE'S SOME THINGS I'M JUST APPALLED THAT I HERE ON THIS FLOOR AND I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GO INTO THE WORDS THAT WE JUST HEARD FROM THE SENATOR FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO THIRTEEN YEAH WRONG I AM VERY REAL WORDS AND YOU ARE RIGHT RACISM HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE DAY. I WOULD SAY I'M VERY PROUD THAT I'M THE ONLY WHITE PERSONON MY STAFF IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE AND WHEN I HIRED BUT THE PEOPLE IN THAT OFFICE I HEARD THEM BASED ON THEIR ABILITY NOT BASED ON THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN AND THEY'LL DO A FANTASTIC JOB. BUT I RISE BECAUSE IS THE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I STAND IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF A CA FIVE THIS MORNING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THE PRIORITY FOR THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND IS CRITICAL THE CALIFORNIANS WHO IMPLEMENTED OPPOSITION TO OWN NINE YEARS AGO. GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPEAL THIS HORRIBLE MAJOR. HERBAL BECAUSE IT SET BACK YEARS OF PROGRESS FOR BLACKS. OTHER RACIAL MINORITIES WOMEN IN OUR STATE. MEMBERS RACISM IS CLEARLY A REALITY TO THIS DAY. AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF RACISM ON EDUCATION. AND OTHER VENUES IN OUR SOCIETY. WE JUST HEARD THAT SOME OF US MIGHT BE VOTING ON THIS. IN FAVOR BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. I WOULD CHALLENGE THAT I WOULD SAY WE'RE VOTING ON THIS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S TIME IT'S PAST TIME. IT PEOPLE MARCHING IN THE STREETS FOR EACH EQUALITY AND EQUITY GET YOU TO VOTE SO THIS MAJOR. TASK PROP WHEN I MAY AT THE TENT TO HELP THE VERSE CITY. HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR ASSET YOU STAND WITH ME AND STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY AND VOTE FOR A CA FIVE. SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY STOP THE ILL EFFECTS OF PROP TWO OH NINE THANK YOU. SENATOR BARGES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I'LL NEVER FORGET A STORY THAT MY FATHER TOLD ME WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER. THAT HE WAS EMPLOYED AT AN ESTABLISHMENT IN A SUPERIOR CAME TO HIM. AND QUICKLY USHERED HIM INTO A- LOCKER AREA. AND WHEN MY FATHER ASKED WHY HE SAID BECAUSE THE OWNERS COMING BY. AND HE DOESN'T LIKE IMMIGRANTS IN HELL FIRE YOU IF HE SEES THAT YOU'RE A GREEK IMMIGRANT. I HAD THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING FRESNO COUNTY AS WELL AS TEN OTHERS IN MY VERY LARGE DISTRICT. BUT I REMEMBER LEARNING THAT IN FRESNO THERE WERE ANTI ARMENIAN COVENANTS. WRITTEN INTO THE LAND USE POLICIES AND RULES OF OUR AREA AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IN OTHER WORDS ARMENIANS COULD NOT BUY PROPERTY IN CERTAIN AREAS THEY WERE DISALLOWED IN OTHERS. I THINK IF YOU IN PRETORIA WHO WATER FOR OUR FRIEND FROM- KERR DEAN IS OUR CENTER FROM CORDY IS HAD IDENTIFIED. RACE IS. PROBLEMATIC IN PUBLIC POLICY AND HOW WE CONDUCT OURSELVES AS A STATE IF HISTORY IS ANY INDICATION. WHERE THE IRISH OR YOU'RE JEWISH- GREEK ARMENIAN OR YOU'RE CHINESE WE ARE REPLETE WITH EXAMPLES IN AMERICA OF DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AND POLICIES. NOW MY FRIEND FROM- A CENTER FROM LOS ANGELES BROUGHT UP- THE REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA V. BAKI I REMEMBER STUDYING THAT IN LAW SCHOOL WAS VERY INTERESTING PIVOTAL CASE- THE STATE'S BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHERE THE SUPREME COURT REJECTED. THE USE OF STRICT RACIAL QUOTAS. AT WITH THAT HAT WAS INTERESTING STRICT RACIAL QUOTAS. AND THEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH PROP WO OH NINE TUNE NINE REJECTED IT THE POLICY OF OUR GREAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. NOW WE'VE HEARD COMMENTARY TODAY THAT IT SHE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT. THAT IS BECOME ENCUMBRANCE AND THE DIFFICULTY TO FOLKS SEEKING- EMPLOYMENT IN ADMISSION INTO HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT SINCE THAT TIME UNIVERSITIES AND JOBS OPPORTUNITIES HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO USE RACE AS ONE OF MANY CONSIDERATIONS IN HIRING OR ADMISSIONS. SO THIS IDEA THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION DOESN'T EXIST IS STOP ACTUALLY ACCURATE WE HAVE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICIES IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPHERES ACROSS OUR STATE ACROSS OUR NATION. IT EXISTS HE GIVES CONSIDERATION TO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND RACE BACKGROUND SEX. IN A NUMBER OF OTHERS SO WE ALREADY HAVE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICIES DESPITE THE FACT THAT TWO OH NINE SAYS THAT WE SHOULDN'T. SO WE HAVE A CONTRADICTION HERE THAT IS IT IS IT IS TROUBLING ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE HEIGHTENED TENSIONS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT. ACA FIVE. IS A PRELUDE. TO INSTITUTIONALIZING QUOTAS. AND THAT TO ME IS A CONCERN. AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE A CONCERN FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. AND IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD BE THE END OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE PROTECTIONS IN THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. SO USING DISCRIMINATION TO COMBAT DISCRIMINATION IS NOT JUST AN OXYMORON AND PRINCIPLE. IT'S BAD POLICY. I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE CANNOT SIMULTANEOUSLY BE DISCRIMINATORY. IN EFFORT TO ADDRESS DISCRIMINATION. AND I THINK THAT TO SUPPORT THIS WOULD BE TO REJECT THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. IN SUPPORT OF EQUAL PROTECTION. WE ARE LITERALLY GETTING. DROWNED OUT BY THE TENSIONS THAT EXIST IN REAL TERMS AND THEY ARE VERY REAL DISCRIMINATION RACIAL PROFILING. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN UPWARD- MOBILITY THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE. BUT THE IDEA OF ON DOING AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION POLICY IN OUR CONSTITUTION IN FAVOR OF DISCRIMINATION JUST DOESN'T DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL TEST. SO I KNOW THAT A LOT OF FOLKS ARE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW STRONG OPINIONS ON THIS. BUT I THINK. ALLOWING US TO USE THE MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW IN GETTING BETTER ASK THEM. WE HEARD Y. K. THROUGH TWELVE. IS A PROBLEMATIC PERIOD FOR ON A LOT OF OUR YOUTH IMPROVING ACCESS TO EDUCATION IMPROVING THE SOCIAL SERVICES THE- THE- THE ZERO THROUGH FIVE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES. THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ARTIFICIALLY. ALLOW FOLKS INTO A UNIVERSITY SETTING OR INTO A JOB PLACEMENT SETTING BY USING QUOTAS IS NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING CHALLENGES. THIS IS THE EASY WAY OUT THE HARD WAY OUT IS TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT- JUST THAT I JUST MENTIONED IN MY OPINION THANK YOU. SENATOR JACKSON'S. THANK YOU ARE MATTER PRESSING COLLEAGUES A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION BUT- I WANT TO START US OR ASK YOU TO COME BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF OUR SESSION. WHEN THE GOOD CALLING FOR MONTEBELLO. TALKED ABOUT THE DALAI LAMA. AND THE NOTION THERE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS PRACTICE HUMAN KINDNESS NO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT THAT SIMPLE NOTION ACTUALLY BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES. BECAUSE IF WE ACTUALLY PRACTICED HUMAN KINDNESS WE WOULD HAVE NO NEED FOR WAR. WE WOULD HAVE NO NEED TO DEVELOP A MILITARY THAT CAN DESTROY EVERY HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET TWENTY TIMES OVER. WE WOULD HAVE NO NEED. FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. WE WOULD HAVE NO NEED. AND WE WOULD NOT SEE LYNCHINGS OR HOLOCAUST OR DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE IF WE ACTUALLY PRACTICED HUMAN KINDNESS WE WOULD TREAT EACH OTHER EQUALLY. BUT THAT ISN'T THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE. AND FRANKLY IT NEVER HAS BEEN. SO PART OF OUR JOB IS TO RECOGNIZE THE ASPIRATION AND TO KEEP REACHING. FOR A BETTER HUMANITY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN'T IGNORE THE HUMANITY IN WHICH WE LIVE AND YES IF WE HAD ZERO TO FIVE EDUCATION AND YASSER FOR EVERY CHILD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE OUTSIDE OF POVERTY AND NOT LIVE IN FEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THEIR HOMES OR ON THEIR STREETS YES THIS WOULD BE A MUCH DIFFERENT WORLD. BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORLD YOU LIVE IN. AND TOOK TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE PASSED IT OPERATED UPON A- FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED NOTION THAT WE LIVE IN A COLOR BLIND AND GENDER BLIND SOCIETY. AND THAT WE DON'T NEED TO RECOGNIZE ORWE DON'T HAVE ANY LEVELS OF DISCRIMINATION. AND THEREFORE WE SHOULDN'T. GIVE ANYONE A MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY THAN ANYONE ELSE. BUT THERE NEVER WAS REALITY. REALITY WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED SHOP OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IS EXACTLY VERY FEW WOMEN ON CORPORATE BOARDS VERY FEW PEOPLE OF COLOR AND CORPORATE BOARDS BUT TEENAGE MAKING FORTY FOUR CENTS TO EVERY DOLLAR A WHITE MAN MAKES. WE HAVE SO MANY INSTANCES. WHERE THERE IS DISCRIMINATION WHETHER YOU'RE WALKING PRECINCTS AND SOMEONE SAYS I'D NEVER VOTE FOR AN ORIENTAL. WHAT DID THE GOOD SENATOR FROM THAT AREA EVER DO TO HAVE SOMEONE SAY. I HATE CHIU BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE OR I WOULD NEVER CONSIDER TAKING I WOULD NEVER TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE WE ALL HAVE STORIES SIDE MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES ON THIS FLOOR. GROWING UP IN IT IN A JEWISH HOME AS A JEWISH PERSON THE DISCRIMINATION THAT I FIXED THAT WE SEE TODAY WHAT WE ARE TOLD IN. WELL NOT REPLACE US. AS A WOMAN YOU KNOW MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM GUARDINO TALKED ABOUT WALKING INTO A ROOM AND NOT SEEING ANYBODY WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES AS A YOUNG ATTORNEY BACK IN THE DAY BEFORE WE. HAD TOO MANY ATTORNEYS FOR GOING INTO A CO ROOM AND BEING ONLY IN THE ANTI COURTROOM. IT'S A STRANGE FEELING BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK OF YOURSELF THAT WAY UNTIL YOU WALK INTO THAT ROOM AND REALIZE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU. SO THAT'S THE REALITY. HUMAN KINDNESS IS ASPIRIN. IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO STRIVE FOR. BUT UNTIL WE STOP THE LYNCHINGS AND STILL WE TALKED TO STOP THE HATRED AND STILL WE SHOULD STOP THE NOTION OF MY NATION'S BIGGER THAN YOUR NATION A WILL READ A CAKE YOU FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. UNTIL WE STOP BEHAVING THAT WAY. WE HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND SAY HOW CAN WE DO THIS BETTER. AND SO OPPOSITION TO NINE OPERATED UNDER A FALSE SENSE OF REALITY. WHAT THIS EFFORT DOES TODAY IT SHOULD SIMPLY SAYS TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS DO WE WANT TO REALLY THINK. THIS NOTION THAT WE LIVE IN A COLOR BLIND AND GENDER BLIND WORLD. DO WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND TRIED TO HELP OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN LESS FORTUNATE THAN WE- THAN MANY OF US YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE GREAT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THE BARKING CASE WHICH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE MENTIONED. THAT WAS A CASE DEALING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WAS TRYING TO HELP INCENTIVIZE AND ALLOW MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND WHAT THE UNIVERSITY WAS TOLD AND SUBSEQUENTLY TOLD. YOU CAN'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT. YOU HAVE TO PRETEND LIKE EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES GROWING UP. AND WE REALIZE THAT ISN'T TRUE AND SO LET'S TAKE THE STEPS NOW TO GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RE THINK. TO CONSIDER TO KEEP TRYING TO AN ASPIRING TO A KINDER MORE EQUAL WORLD WE ARE NOT THERE. WE ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THERE WE HAVE NEVER PASSED AN EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT WOMEN ARE NOT CONSIDERED EQUAL IN THE EYES OF THE LAW. AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE WHO COME TO US WHO HAVE DIFFERENT COLOR SKIN OR DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES ARE DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES OR DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES ARE DIFFERENT RELIGIONS. ARE NOT TREATED EQUALLY. AND THIS BILL. GIVES THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THAT. AND TO ALSO RECOGNIZE NOT THE ONE WILL GET A LEG UP BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE OR BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER THEY WILL CHARGE TAPPING THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND THAT'S WHY BIRD DRIVE VOTE. SENATOR WESSEL. THANK YOU AND PRESENTERS I FEEL THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM KERN ASKED ME A QUESTION I FELT COMPLIED TO REPLY BECAUSE SHE ASKED A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. AND THERE IS A VERY. VERY IMPORTANT ANSWER I MEAN THIS IS- THE ESSENCE OF PROP TWO NINE. WAS IT MISLED CALIFORNIANS. REPRESENTED OF LANGUAGES SAID WE SHALL KNOW THAT THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE WHO WOULD NOT SUPPORT THAT. AND I MENTION THE THINKING THAT IT WAS AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE. BUT PRIOR TO THAT THE ARGUMENTS WERE MADE THAT THEY- A STUDENT THAT HAD BETTER GRADES HAVE NOT BEEN ADMITTED. TO ONE OF OUR UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE A PERSON WITH LESS GRADES HAD AND THAT THEY WERE DENIED A SPOT. AND THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT SO THEY MADE OF THE PERSON WHO WAS NOT ADMITTED BECAUSE OF. THERE UP SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE OF THE RACE. THAT THEY WERE THE PERSON DISCRIMINATING AGAINST. BUT MY QUESTION RETURN IS IF THIS IS AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE WHY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF TWO NINE DO WE HAVE LESS STUDENTS OF COLOR NUMBER UNIVERSITIES WHY HAS IT GONE DOWN IF IT'S REALLY ABOUT NON DISCRIMINATION WE SHOULD HAVE THAT NUMBER SHOULD HAVE INCREASED. BUT IS GONE DOWN. AND OFTEN I FEEL WHEN I THINK OF PROP TWO NINE THAT. THE BEST WAY TO CHALLENGES AFTER NOW OF TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF DATA. THAT WE SHOULD CHALLENGE PROP TWO NINE THE COURTS. BECAUSE IT MOST CERTAINLY WILL LOSE BECAUSE AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE HAS REALLY RESULT IN DISCRIMINATION AND I ALSO WANT TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS OUT PRACTICALLY. AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU MY STORY. AND A STORY OF ONE OF MY- OF A THIS IS A SCHOOL. I GRADUATED FROM PORTLAND MY HIGH SCHOOL. WITH A BAND. BUT I REMEMBER I HAD A FRIEND THAT ALSO WENT TO UCLA. HE WAS THE SON. OF A VERY PROMINENT DOCTOR AND A PROMINENT JUDGE FROM SAN DIEGO. AND GROWING UP HE HAD TUTORS HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK GROWING UP WE NEVER HAD A JOB. HE WAS OF A VERY EXCELLENT STUDENT. BUT HE HAD HE LIVED IN A BEAUTIFUL HOME IN POINT LOMA. AND HAD A VERY HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE. AND HE GOT EXCELLENT GRADES WHAT I WANT TO POINT MY HIGH SCHOOL I USED TO GET UP AT FOUR IN THE MORNING AND DO MY PAPER OUT TO DELIVER PAPERS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HOMES MY NEIGHBORHOOD. BALL BEFORE SIX AM. I OFTENTIMES WHAT'S WAS LATE BECAUSE OF RAIN OR WHATEVER FACTORS THAT MADE ME LOOK RELATE SO I OFTEN WAS RUNNING AFTER THE BUS AND THE BUS DRIVER MADE A JOKE OF IT THAT IF I DIDN'T RIGHT EXACTLY TIME HE SAW ME IN HIS RIVER NEAR HE TOOK OFF TO MAYBE RUN AFTER HIM. I RAN TRACK NO RESTAURANT CROSS COUNTRY SO I OFTEN CUT THE BUS AT THE NEXT STOP HALF A MILE LATER. BUT WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL. I DID MY PAPER OUT AFTER SCHOOL I HAD A JOB. AND I HAVE TO WORK IN MY FAMILY BUSINESS AND SOMETIMES I HAD A JOB WORKING AT THE SHOPPING CENTER. THOUSAND DOWNTOWN I ALSO AS I MENTIONED RAN TRACK AND CROSS COUNTRY I STARTED A CLUB IN FRONT LOCAL DISPENSED CLUB BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T LET ME START MENCHACA ONE STAR MITCHELL. AND THE SCHOOL LEADERS I WAS TO POLITICAL. BUT I ALSO WAS IN SPEECH CLUB I ALSO WAS IN THEATER I WAS IN JAZZ CLUB. I WAS IN MARCHING BAND. AND I ALSO- YOU KNOW WAS A CULTURE BOY ON MY CHURCH. AND SO WHAT WHAT YOURS WHAT THIS MEASURE DID BASICALLY IS WHEN. WHEN MY SCHOOL MATE APPLY TO UCLA. I WHEN I APPLIED BACK THEN. I GOT I GRADUATED THE TOP PERCENTILE I CRIED REFER DISTANCE DISTINCTION AYE I NEVER READ MY DIPLOMA UNTIL LIKE TWENTY YEARS LATER NICE BUT I WILL GRADUATE FROM DISTINCT DISTINCTION. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW. BUT WHEN I APPLY TO UCLA THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT. THE FACT THAT I WORKED. TWENTY HOURS A WEEK THAT I WAS IN TRACK AND FIELD AND CROSS COUNTRY AND THAT I OF DIDN'T HAD A NEW PAPER ROUTE THAT I WAS IN CLUBS AND ACT AND I WAS THEATER AND I WAS IN MUSIC. AND NOW THE YOU DID ME AS A PERSON. THAT WOULD BRING SOMETHING OF VALUE NOT ONLY TO THE UNIVERSITY. BUT TO SOCIETY. AND UNDER PROP TWO OH NINE THAT THEY COULD ONLY LOOK AT MY GROUP AT MY GPA AND MY A CITY SCORES SO WHAT ALL OF YOU ARE SAYING BY OPPOSING THIS MEASURE IS IT DOESN'T MATTER. BUT I HAD A JOB AND THAT WAS COMPETING AGAINST SOMEBODY THAT AME FROM AN AFFLUENT HOME WITHOUT A JOB. IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT IT CAME. FROM A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WITH WHAT LOWER QUALITY SCHOOLS YEAH I WAS ABLE TO. OF DON'T APPLY TO COLLEGES THAT WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE IMPROVE MYSELF I WANT LOTS OF PEOPLE TO SCHOOL BUT NOW THEY CAME FROM POOR FAMILIES A BECAUSE WE GOT A CHANCE TO GO TO YOU SEE OKAY NOW ARE LEADERS IN THE COMMUNITY ENGINEERS HELPING ALL TRENDS ARE THE PLUGGED INTO OUR SOCIETY REVERSING COOL POVERTY GET NOW NOW THEY DO THEIR KIDS DON'T NEED HELP BECAUSE THEY COME FROM HOME. WITH WITH WITH THE WITH THE PARENT COLLEGE AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE LESIONS ON THE SHOW. THAT THE CHILDREN. OF PARENTS THAT COLLEGE. HAVE A AND THE CHILDREN. OF PARENTS IT DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE OF A 4% CHANCES FLIPPER. YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF ACTUALLY EVEN WANTING TO GO TO COLLEGE READING OF APPLYING TO COLLEGE. OR MEET HARDER IF YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE. YOU HAVE TO ADJUST FOR THAT IN SOCIETY WHY DON'T WE LOOK AT THE PERSON THE APPLICANT AND SAY. YOU ARE GONNA BE. FANTASTIC IN OUR UNIVERSITY. WE YOU BRING ANOTHER SKILL SET THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED THAT'S WHERE. MY ARGUMENTS OF DIVERSE CITY CAME IN AND THAT'S WHAT I WANTED ALL OF YOU TO UNDERSTAND AND I APOLOGIZE IF I DIDN'T MAKE MY POINT. AND I LEAVE THE QUESTION IF. AGAIN I'LL ASK IT ONE MORE TIME IF THIS IS REALLY AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE WHY IS THE RESULT DISCRIMINATION. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TODAY I JUST WANNA FIRST OF ALL HIDE LIGHT THE TESTIMONY OF MY GOOD FRIEND AND SENATOR FROM GUARDINO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I HEAR YOUR PASSION YOUR PAIN BECAUSE I THINK IN SOME WAY ONE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ALL OF US HAVE BEEN THERE IN THAT MOMENT THAT WE FELT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. AND SO I WANT TO JUST BRING MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO THIS AND I THINK I'VE TOLD THE STORY OFTEN THAT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WENT TO MY COLLEGE COUNSELOR TO SAY THAT I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I WAS TOLD THAT. THAT'S NOT A PLACE FOR ME THAT TEEN US- THAT WAS A COLLEGE MATERIAL LATINOS. WERE MEANT TO GET MARRIED AND HAVE BABIES. AND BECAUSE OF BAD. ADVICE I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE. UNTIL I WAS TWENTY FIVE. AND SO. DISCRIMINATION ISRAEL AND- ALL OF US HAVE. AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER HAVE FELT IT AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND I WOULD SAY SOME OF US MORE THAN OTHERS BECAUSE I HEARD THE TESTIMONY FROM. MY FRIEND FROM GARDENA THAT'S- VERY POWERFUL AND I'M SORRY FOR ALL THOSE MOMENTS THAT YOU FELT. YOU WERE LESS THAN BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE. AND SO I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT TO MISCONCEPTIONS THAT I OFTEN HEAR THAT. ARE REALLY DISTRESSING TO ME I OFTEN HEAR THAT. PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPORTING A CA FIVE PAR IT'S NOT A TEEN- BILL- IN IN THIRTY HERE ON THE FLOORWE HEARD- THE API CAUCUS. BLACK HAWK IS LATINO CAUCUS. AND SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THERE IS SUPPORT FOR THIS NOT ONLY ACROSS OUR GROUPS HERE BUT ACROSS OUR STATE. AND SO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT EVEN OUR STATE COMPTROLLER BABIES SUPPORT SAID. THE LARA ARM. SUPPORT CENTER INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THE FRESNO BLACK CAUCUS I'M SORRY BLACK CHAMBER AND AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE IN LOS ANGELES DOWN SOUTH. WE ALSO HAVE THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DISTRICT TO UP NORTH I REALLY JUST WANT TO POINT OUT HOW BROAD THE SUPPORT IS IT'S NOT A LATINO BILL AN AFRICAN AMERICAN BILL THE API CAUCUS BILL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COLLECTIVELY WE SUPPORT ACROSS THE STATE. AND I THINK THAT WOULD YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD MANY OF. THE PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE IT KEEP TELLING ME IT'S A LATINO BILL IT'S NOT. ON SECOND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MANY TIMES I HEAR THAT WE JUST WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT QUALIFIED. AND I WANT TO STRONGLY STRONGLY DISAGREE OF COURSE WERE QUALIFIED. IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND WE TO SLACK OPPORTUNITIES THOUGHT URGE YOUR BIBLE THANK YOU. SENATOR GONZALEZ. IF YOU COULD HOLD SECOND. TRY AGAIN OKAY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IN COLLEGE TO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AC FIVE- I THINK MY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES HAD MENTIONED ABOUT WOMEN IN CONTRACTS AND MINORITY BUSINESSES AND AS WE KNOW AND I JUST HAVE TO AGAIN REITERATE BACK IN THE NINETIES- A CALIFORNIA AGAIN HAVE THE TOP PERFORMING STATE TERMS OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING FOR WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AGAIN IT WORSENS DURING THE REPEAL OF PROP TWO OH NINE BECOMING ONE OF THE LEAST RACIALLY DIVERSE STATES WHEN IT CAME TO. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING AGAIN LESS THAN NEBRASKA WHICH IS NOT A VERY GOOD AS WE KNOW WOMEN WERE- TACKLING CONTRACTING AGAINST MEN MOSTLY INCUMBENTS. A HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEM OF CONTRACTING THAT- TOOK OVER OUR STATE OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRACTING LOSSES WERE FILLED BY WOMEN. AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AND WOMEN IN MY ALREADY OWN BUSINESSES DURING THIS TIME. ACTUALLY GROUPS OF THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL WAS JUST VERY SMALL BUT IT GREW BECAUSE- BECAUSE WHY THEY WERE LOCKED OUT OF. GOVERNMENT JOBS AND THEY WERE LOCKED OUT OF HIGHER EDUCATION THEY HAD NO OTHER OPPORTUNITY BUT TO CREATE THEIR OWN BUSINESSES. BUT AS WE KNOW SELF EMPLOYED WOMEN SELF EMPLOYED MINORITIES HIRE WOMEN AND THEY HIRE A MINORITY WORKFORCE THEY ALSO CAN CREATE SUPPLEMENT MARKETS- TO BUILD CAPITAL NETWORKS AND SUPPLIES AND SKILLS AND SUPPLY CHAINS AND AS THE FEDERAL CARES ACT IS PROVIDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES DURING THIS TIME. IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR VOTERS TO WEIGH IN WHY NOT GIVE THEM A GREATER SHARE OF THE PROSPERITY IN THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. SPECIALLY AS WERE INVESTING AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS FOR THESE COMMUNITIES. AND ARE AS BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO COME BACK ON LINE. THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS WHEN YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD A SEAT AT THE TABLE AC FIVE SEEMS LIKE AN INJUSTICE BUT WHEN YOU'VE SEEN AND JUSTICE AND YOU FELT AND JUSTICE YOUR WHOLE LIFE AC FIVE IS TRULY AN OPPORTUNITY AND FOR THAT I STAND STRONG SUPPORT OF EASY FIVE. SENATOR MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- AND THANK YOU COLLEAGUES FOR. ALL OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE HERE SO FAR ON THIS BILL. I SAT AND LISTENED TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA. TWO I LOVE. AND. THAT WAS AND- I SHOW THAT WAS PASSION. COMING FROM HIM THAT IS DEEP PAIN AND HURT. THAT WAS GENUINE. COMING FROM HIM. A NIGHT ACTUALLY I APPRECIATE THOUGH IT'S HARD TO LISTEN TO I APPRECIATE HEARING IT I THINK- WE GET ALL STEVEN TO HEAR IT FROM TIME TO TIME AND BE REMINDED. OF THE INJUSTICES THAT HAVE BEEN- FELT BY SOME OF OUR FOLKS THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT I. PATENTLY REJECT THE NOTION THAT THIS STATE IS RECESSED OR THAT THIS COUNTRY IS RACIST. THIS IS THE LEAST RACIST COUNTRY ON THE PLANET. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEEP HATE IN THEIR HEART BIGOTS RACISTS WHO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY ABSOLUTELY NO ONE CAN DENY THAT. AND AT TIMES WE HAD TO WORK ALONGSIDE THEM. WE HAD TO SUFFER LISTENING TO THE RHETORIC THAT COMES OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS NO ONE IS DISPUTING THAT. THIS IS A STATE IN THE COUNTRY OF OPPORTUNITY. THIS STATE PUT MEASURES IN PLACE PARTICULAR WITHIN OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY. WITHOUT USING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. PERCENT PLANS A GUARANTEED MISSION TO LOWER INCOME STUDENTS AND THOSE WHO COME FROM A LOWER ECONOMIC BACKGROUND. THEY LOOK AT FAMILY INCOME FAMILY WEALTH PARENTS EDUCATION LEVEL. THERE'S FINANCIAL AID SCHOLARSHIPS GRANTS THE UC SYSTEM GOT RID OF LEGACY PROGRAM SO THAT THE KIDS OF THE WEALTHY WHITE STUDENTS THEIR PARENTS WHO CAME BEFORE THEM DIDN'T GET A LEG UP ON SOMEONE ELSE TO WORK JUST AS HARD MAYBE EVEN HARDER. TO GET RID OF THAT. THERE IS A NUMBER OF THINGS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY MY COLLEAGUE FROM. FRESNO I THINK HE'S WALKING IN RIGHT NOW- MADE SOME POINTS THAT WORD WERE SPOT ON FRANKLY NO AND I HOPE EVERYONE PAID ATTENTION AT THAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A NUMBER OF. ESSENTIALLY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TYPE OF REGULATIONS IN PLACE THAT'S A FACT. CAN WE DO MORE. WE CAN'T BUT IS THE ANSWER TO. ANSWER WHAT ONE THINKS IS DISCRIMINATION WITH MORE DISCRIMINATION NO IT'S NOT. WE WANT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET INTO COLLEGE OUR FOLKS ARE LOOKING TO GET A PARTICULAR JOB TO GET IT BECAUSE THEY EARNED IT AND BECAUSE THEY ARE QUALIFIED INTO NEVER QUESTION THEMSELVES AND THINK. DID I GET THIS FOR SOME OTHER REASON TO NEVER ALLOW ANYBODY ELSE THEY WORK WITH THE GO TO SCHOOL WITH. TO LOOK AT THEM AND THINK. HOW DID YOU GET HERE. THAT'S UNFAIR TO PUT SOMEONE IN THAT TYPE OF POSITION. I THINK. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. TALENTED STUDENTS POTENTIAL STUDENTS A NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN THIS STATE WHO. CAN GET THESE JOBS IN CAN GET AND CAN GET INTO THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY BELONG THERE THEY DESERVE IT AND THEY'VE EARNED IT GIVEN THE CHANCE TO DO THAT WITHOUT. PUTTING THEM IN A POSITION. TO SECOND GUESS THEMSELVES. I MEAN THIS BUILDING PUTS POLICIES IN THE PLACE WILK SOMEONE I DON'T RECALL WHO IT WAS WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW IT STARTS AT THE AT THE LOWER GRADE LEVEL OF SCHOOL AND HOW KIDS ARE IN. SCHOOLS THAT JUST TO BE AREN'T HIGH PERFORMING AND SO THEY'RE ALREADY BEHIND WHEN THEY GET TO START WELL WHY IN THE WORLD IS THIS BODY NOT DOING SOMETHING TO ENSURE THAT THOSE KIDS CAN GET INTO THE VERY BEST K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. THIS BODY CONTINUALLY EVERY YEAR WE HAVE BILLS RELATING TO SCHOOL CHOICE WHETHER IT'S CHARTER SCHOOLS HOME SCHOOLS YOU NAME IT. WE TRY TO PUT THINGS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THEIR LIVES TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE AN EQUAL SHOT. AND TIME AFTER TIME THIS BODY. REFUSES THAT. DO YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS YOU CAN'T SAY WE WANT THEM TO GET ON TO A GOOD SCHOOL WE WANT THEM TO HAVE THESE THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. BUT YOU DON'T EVEN ALLOW THEM TO GET STARTED. YOU CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. I WOULD URGE IN ABOUT. SENATOR BELL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TO. TALK ABOUT TO A IN SUPPORT IS. CONSTITUTION MOMENT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MY EXPERIENCE. WORKING IN- BUILDING TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES. PUBLIC CONTRACTS. NOW PART OF PART OF THE LAW ACTUALLY MENTIONS PART OF PUBLIC CONTRACTS. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PUBLIC CONTRACTS. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IS WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A FAIR PROCESS OF BIDDING AND AWARDING A PUBLIC CONTRACTS IN THE BEST INTEREST FOR THE PUBLIC. AND MY EXPERIENCE HAVING BACK IN THE IT ACTUALLY GOES BACK OVER THIRTY YEARS WHEN I CHAIRED THE pBOARD IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY SAN JOSE. OF WE CREATED A- MINORITY BUSINESS WOMEN ENTERPRISE PROGRAM. TO SET SOME GOALS TO HAVE MORE BUSINESSES FROM OUR COMMUNITY. TO BED AND BE INVOLVED. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED THE HALF CENT SALES TAX. AT THAT TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE. WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO GROW THE INDUSTRY. WE HAD FIRST THE FIRST PROCESS IS TO HAVE THE MAIN CONTRACTORS THAT WORK THE HIGHER. SUBCONTRACTORS MINORITY WOMEN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE SUBCONTRACTORS PRETTY SOON WE HAD MINORITY BUSINESS WOMEN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PRIME CONTRACTORS. SO WE WERE GROWING pCONTRACTORS WITH HIGHER. PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. WHO WERE WORKERS. WHO THEN THEMSELVES BECAME CONTRACTORS. NOW WHAT IS THIS IS A GOOD THING WELL. I LIKE TO HAVE MORE BIDDERS WHEN I HAVE A PROJECT I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE A SMALL GROUP OF BIDDERS I BECOME REAL SUSPICIOUS WHEN I SEE ONLY ONE. CONTRACTOR BIDDING ON A PROJECT. SB US ABOUT THAT'S THE WAY IT USED TO BE. AND WHEN WE DID THIS PROGRAM WE HAD SOME PEOPLE THAT CAME TO ME AND SAID HEY JIM OF. YOU'RE YOU'RE DESCRIBING ALL THESE. THESE NEW RULES. BECAUSE WE CAN COME IN AND DO THE JOB AND YOU KNOW CALTRANS SAID OUR WORK WOULD BE DONE ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS WELL WE SAID WE'RE GOING TO DO IT OUR WAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE COMMUNITY DO THE WORK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE CONTRACTORS BIDDING. AND GUESS WHAT WE GOT WE GOT THE PROJECT'S FINISHED ON TIME AND ON BUT BEFORE OF CALTRANS SAID NOT WITH A DOING A SEVENTEEN YEARS WE DID NOT AND A HALF YEARS. FINISHED TENS OF THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF CONSTRUCTION. MORE BETTORS MEANS MORE COMPETITION AND BETTER PRICE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE UNITED MINORITY CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE EARLY NINETIES. YOU'RE LOOKING OUT THE PUBLIC OFFICIAL THE YEAR YOUR CHAIR YOUR SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. I WAS AWARDED THAT AWARD. AND WE SET THE TONE FOR CALTRANS. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE WORK WAS DONE BY CALTRANS BEFORE THEY DON'T HAVE VERY MANY BIDDERS. AFTER WE STARTED DOING WHAT WE DID WE START HAVING MORE BIDDERS. WE STARTED LOOKING TO SEVER THEIR RULES AND FOUND OUT THAT. THEY INHIBITED BIDDERS. I DON'T BELIEVE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. CHANGING. OUR VIEWS ABOUT DISCRIMINATION. BUT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY WANT TO BE COLOR BLIND. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE BLIND. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM MY STANDPOINT ON THESE CONTRACTS IF YOU'RE BLINDED THERE'S- BELIEVE MAY. THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT THING THIS IS A REGRESSION. AFTER PROP TWO OH NINE. PROP TWO OH NINE DESTROYED WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. PROP TWO OH NINE. PUSHED IT BACKWARDS INTO THE OLD DAYS BELIEVE ME WHEN. WE WERE ENGAGED IN WRITING SB ONE. AND WE PUT SOME REAL HEAVY. PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS OF INVOLVEMENT YOU KNOW WE COULD PUT. THE CARD OF PARTICIPATION RULES WE HAD BACK IN THE HEYDAY WHEN WE DID IN THE NINETIES. BUT THE CENTER FROM GUARDIAN I. CREATED A- SET A SET OF STATUTES. THAT REQUIRED MORE PARTICIPATION BUT I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL DON'T SHOOT. THREE QUARTERS OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY ON OUR TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES. OUR WOMEN AND MINORITIES MAILING MINORITIES NOT ENOUGH WOMEN. BUT LESS THAN MINORITIES. I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL EURO SO IN OTHER WORDS. THEY'RE DOING ALL THE WORK BUT THE CONTRACTORS ARE MAKING ALL THE PROFIT. SO THAT'S THE RESULT. PROPOSITION TWO OR NINE. TO ME THAT'S AN EVIL. THAT'S AN EVIL. WE NEED TO HAVE. OPPORTUNITIES I TALKED TO A COUPLE YEARS AGO A- ELECTRICAL. CONTRACTOR WHO WORKED IN ELECTRIC SHOULD BUSINESS HE WAS A UNION MEMBER. AND HE SAID JIM I'M FINALLY GOING TO CREATE MY BUSINESS I'M GOING TO CREDIT MY CONSTRUCTION MY ELECTRIC CONTRACTING BUSINESS. AND I SAID YOU KNOW. I MEAN YOU DID A HIGH TECH CLEAN ROOMS YOU DO IT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE MOST. DETAILED HIGH QUALITY ELECTRICAL WORK. A MANAGEABLE YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR THOSE COMPANIES THAT WANT TO PERFECTLY CLEAN ROOMS- ALL THE PROPER ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS. WORK AND HOW COME IT TOOK YOU SO LONG. HE SAID YOU KNOW. WE STILL HAVE THE GOOD OLD BOYS SYSTEM. WE STILL HAVE THE GOOD OLD BOY SYSTEM SO FOR ME. THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE IF WE DON'T CHANGE IT GUESS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE PAYING MORE MONEY FOR YOUR CONTRACTS. YOU WANT TO YOU WANT TO JUST GOT A- IGNORE THAT FINE BUT IF WE WANT TO GET SOME OF GUYS LIKE THIS I CAN COME IN AND DO SOME GREAT CONTRACTING WORK. IT SEEMS TO ME WE OUGHT TO MAE SOME RULES. THAT BENEFIT TE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT. SPECIFIC PEOPLE THAT BENEFIT. BY THE- THAT. WERE PUT ON THE BALLOT WITHOUT PROPER REVIEW. THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT VERY CLOSELY. SO FOR ME. I THINK THAT THIS LAW NEEDS TO PASS. I WANT TO SEE MORE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN WOMEN MINORITY CONTRACTING I WANT TO SEE THEIR COMPETITION. I WANT TO SEE IT FIRST INDUSTRY FLOURISH. WE HAVE A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS TO BUILD. WE HAVE WATER SYSTEM- EDUCATION FACILITIES TRANSPORTATION TRANSIT WE HAVE A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS WERE GOING TO BUILD IN THIS STATE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS STATE A GREAT STATE. AND BY GOLLY EVERYBODY EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE. SENATOR ALLEN. MEMBERS I JUST WANTED TO ADD TO THE LIST OF FOLKS WHO'VE COME OUT AN ENDORSEMENT- THE JEWS CAUCUS AS WELL AS IS COME OUT AND DOORS AND FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE IN A RACE CONTINUE TO MATTER FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED FOR TODAY AND I THINK IT'S- A. ASIAN AND VOTERS TO REVISIT THIS QUARTER CENTURY ALL DECISION. SENATOR UMBERG. A AT LISTEN TO THE MOVING COMMENTS OF SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE. THE IMPASSIONED SPEECHES- I KNOW IT'S HARD TO TELL BUT I'M AN OLD WHITE GUY. AN OLD STRAIGHT WHITE GUY. AND I AM NOT EXPERIENCE THE KINDS OF. EPISODES THAT WERE EXPERIENCED BY MANY OF THE FOLKS HERE FACT I GREW UP IN OF AREA AND MIDWEST THAT WAS LARGELY ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WHITE. OF ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY CATHOLIC THE GREAT DIVERSITY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WAS BETWEEN ST MARTIN'S INSANE AL'S AND YOU COULDN'T TRUST THOSE PEOPLE SAY MARTIN THIS. MOTHER WOULD SAY. THAT WAS THE DIVERSITY THAT I GREW UP WITH IN FACT THE ISSUES OF RACE I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT TELL YOU THE TRUTH UNTIL I WAS. OLDER IT WASN'T UNTIL I ACTUALLY WAS IN THE ARMY. IT WASN'T UNTIL I OBSERVE GOING THRU OFFICER BASIC TRAIN THEIR FORTY FOUR MEN IN OUR TRAINING PLATOON ALL GOING TO BE SECOND LIEUTENANTS. ALL WHITE. AND AFTER BECOMING A SECOND LIEUTENANT THEORETICALLY YOUR COMMANDING INTER AN INFANTRY PLATOON. OF FORTY FOUR SOLDIERS OF WHICH AT LEAST THE THIRD IF NOT A HALF A MINORITY. AND SO WHEN HE ENTERED THE ARMY. THERE WAS TREMENDOUS RACIAL STRIFE TREMENDOUS RACIAL STRIDES POSE VIETNAM THE ARMY WAS BROKEN THERE WERE INCIDENTS ALL OVER NO WONDER WE HADN'T ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ALL WHITE OFFICER CORPS LEADING AN ARMY THAT WAS BETWEEN THE THIRD AND A HALF MINORITY. THINGS CHANGED THE MILITARY THE ARMY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WERE ISSUES OF LEADERSHIP. AND REACHED OUT AND TRIED TO CHANGE THE EQUATION IS IT PERFECT HASN'T WORKED COMPLETELY IT IS NOT. BUT WHAT THE MILITARY DID IS THEY REACHED OUT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT DIVERSITY AMONG THE OFFICER RANKS LEAD TO A STRONGER MILITARY TO A STRONGER NATIONAL DEFENSE. AND SO IF YOU OBSERVE TODAY IN WEST POINT LAST WEST POINT CLASS HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES GRADUATE THAT THE ENTERING CLASS NOW IS ABOUT 37% MINORITY WHICH MAKES SENSE. I OBSERVED OVER THE THIRTY YEARS I WAS IN AND OUT OF THE ARMY THAT THE ARMY CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. FROM AN ARMY THAT WAS BROKEN. THAT WAS. REPLETE WITH STRIFE. TO AN ARMY THAT WAS FAR MORE FUNCTIONAL IN FACT. PERHAPS THE GREATEST ARMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE FOLKS RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE STRONGER WHEN WE HAVE LEADERS. WHO ARE DIVERS WHO BRING DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES TO THE FOR WE'RE STRONGER WHEN WE HAVE LEADERS WHO LIED PEOPLE WHO CAN LOOK UP TO THEM AS ROLE MODELS AND SO I STILL STRONG SUPPORT THEY SEE A FIVE. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. BECAUSE IT'S FAIR BECAUSE IT'S JUST BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT AND BECAUSE IT LEADS TO A STRONGER ECONOMY AND A STRONGER NATIONAL DEFENSE ARJUNA VOTE. UNDER THE- THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I APOLOGIZE FOR ASKING TO SPEAK AGAIN BUT I WON'T APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY AGAIN I WILL SAY THAT THE THINGS I HERE ON THIS FLOOR SOMETIMES ARE JUST SHOCKING TO ME I FIND IT UNCONSCIONABLE AND INCREDIBLY DISINGENUOUS THAT THE SENATOR FROM LAKE ELSINORE WHO IS A WHITE WOMAN AS I AM A WHITE WOMAN WOULD SAY THAT WE LIVE IN THE LEAST RACIST STATE AND THE LEAST RACIST COUNTRY. FOR TWO REASONS ONE I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT BUT TO LEAST RACIST IMPLIES THAT RACISM STILL EXISTS WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TRY AND CHANGE THAT AND MAYBE FOR HER AS A WHITE WOMAN SHE HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED RACISM BUT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN OUR STATE IN OUR COUNTRY HAVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO ONE SMALL THING TODAY WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO. RISE SAY THAT BECAUSE I ALSO THINK IT SHOULD BE IN A ON MY COLLEAGUE OF MY FROM LOS ANGELES TO ADDRESS OF THESE ABSURDITIES SHE HAD HEARD CLOSE THANK YOU MA'AM PRESIDENT. SENATE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I AB WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION AND I WAS TOLD THAT THINGS OPERATED A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY OVER HERE ON THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER- BUT I GUESS THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO- IT YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF TIMES. PEOPLE I DON'T LIKE WHAT SOMEONE HAS TO SAY ON THIS FLOOR BUT A PERSONAL ATTACK. AGAINST ME FOR SOME FOR AN OPINION THAT I EXPRESSED I THINK IS REALLY AN APPROPRIATE. TERRIBLY UNPROFESSIONAL AND FRANKLY BEHAVIOR NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE POSITION. HOLE AS STATE HERS. THANK YOU FOR THE SALUTE I APPRECIATE THAT- IS SO I WOULD JUST ASK MADAM PRESIDENT. THAT WE COULD CERTAINLY MAKE SURE WE ARE HERE TO THE DECORUM AND RULES OF THE SENATE- AND KEEP THIS A CIVILIZED DISCUSSION RATHER THEY AND- SO A TAX. THE VERY MUCH MADAM PRO TEM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE LISTENED. TO ALL OF THE COMMENTS TODAY AND CERTAINLY IT HAS BEEN- A PASSIONATE DISCUSSION WITH A LOT OF RELEVANT POINTS. IN OUR- WE ALL HAVE STORIES WE ARE HAVE A LENS THAT WE PUT AND EVALUATE THINGS THROUGH WHETHER WE WANT TO HAVE IT OR NOT WE DO. OUR STORE. THIS IS DUE. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT ARE I WILL BY THE WAY I RISE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF A CA FIVE. YOU KNOW TWO NINE MAY TELL YOU TO BE COLOR BLIND AND OTHERS HAVE SAID THIS OR GENDER NEUTRAL BUT THAT JUST ISN'T THE REALITY IT'S NOT THE REALITY. AND THAT'S WHY WE DEBATE THESE THINGS THAT'S WHY THE CONSTITUTION WAS DEBATED THE BILL OF RIGHTS CAME OUT. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE WE LOOK FOR EXPERIENCE AND THE SOCIETY IS GOING ON IN TODAY'S WORLD. FROM WHICH TO DETERMINE WHAT THE METRICS WILL BE. OUR I HAVE EXPERIENCED- CERTAINLY ARE ISN'T LGBT Q. ARE MEMBER OF THAT COMMUNITY I'VE EXPERIENCED DISCRIMINATION I'VE EXPERIENCED DISCRIMINATION AS A WOMAN BUT I WILL TELL YOU THE WORST DISCRIMINATION I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE. WAS AS A POOR PERSON A PERSON ARE THEY COME THROUGH A VERY BLUE COLLAR WORKING CLASS BACKGROUND AN APPALACHIAN A SOUTHERNER WITHOUT A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY. AND I KNEW I WAS DIFFERENT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE I CAN ONLY IMAGINE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF I HAD TO ADD A RACE OR AN ETHNIC- COMPONENT TO ALL OF THESE OTHER FACTORS SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS LIKE BUT I'LL TELL YOU I DO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE. OF HAVE WORLD. WOMAN COMING OUT AS A LESBIAN AT AGE EIGHTEEN. AND SO I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SURVIVAL AND HOW TO BE CAREFUL AND HOW TO NAVIGATE THE WORLD. OUR BUT I GET A GOOD EDUCATION THANKS TO SOME OF THE RULES THAT WERE IN PLACE THAT ALLOWED ME TO GET GRANT SINCE AND I GOT SCHOLARSHIPS I WORKED VERY HARD. BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS MANY OF THE KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL WITH ME THAT LIVED ON THE- RIGHT SIDE OBVIOUSLY. OF THE TRACKS. BUT I GET A GOOD EDUCATION I GOT TO COLLEGE WITH A LOT OF SUPPORT. AND TODAY I AM THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE SENATE OF CALIFORNIA THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. I'D LOVE TO SHARE WITH YOU THE STORY MY SISTER. WHO HAS WHO TOOK A DIFFERENT PATH. AND WHO DIDN'T- SOMEHOW GET THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE. SHE WHEN THE MILITARY SHE'S A PROUD VETERAN AS WAS HER HUSBAND NOW DECEASED. BUT HER EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD IS VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE PEOPLE PERCEIVE HER NOT TO BE A- WHITE WOMEN THE PRIVILEGE SHE STILL HAS A LOT OF THE ISSUES. FROM THE BLUE COLLAR WORKING CLASS POOR COMMUNITY THAT WE CAME FROM. AND WE TELL YOU SHE'S TREATED DIFFERENTLY. SHE'S TREATED DIFFERENTLY AND SHE ACTS DIFFERENTLY SHE WOULD NEVER THINK TO ASK FOR SOMETHING THAT SHE DESERVES. AND I FEEL THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE PEOPLE TREAT ME LIKE THE WHITE WOMAN A PRIVILEGE I SEEM TO BE UNTIL I GET MY ACCESS HALFWAY THROUGH. BY I ONLY SHARE MY STORY BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE TENSIONS TODAY EXIST BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ADDRESS THE ISSUES. BE THE SAME RELEASE OUR GENDER OUR ORIENTATION OUR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY YOU HEAR A LOT OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY- AND AN EQUITY THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS BECAUSE THAT DAY YOU KNOW BE POOR AND ECONOMICALLY. DISADVANTAGED CROSSES ALL LINES ARE. YOU KNOW OUR OUR HAS SOME REALLY PRETTY BASIC COMMENTS BUT I WANTED TO JUST THROW THAT OUT THERE AND BY THE WAY. YOU KNOW DIVERSITY NOT JUST HAPPEN IT TAKES WORK HARD WORK. FOCUSED WORK. AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I THINK I'M A PRETTY GOOD PERSON I LIKE TO THINK THAT I. AM ACCEPTING IT OPEN BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCES THAT I. AND BETTER RIGHT. AND THEN I TOOK THE IMPLICIT BIAS SURVEY. AND BOY DID I LEARN A FEW THINGS ABOUT MYSELF I WAS SO DEPRESSED AND DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS A REMINDER TO ME. I HAVE WORK TO DO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD IT IS TO COME UP WITH PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES AND RULES AND- IN THE END TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROMOTE AN EQUITABLE PLAYING FIELD. HOW DO WE DO THAT. WITHOUT OFFENDING EACH OTHER. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE DO THAT BECAUSE IN OUR ATTEMPTS TO BEHIND OR OR ONE ON ONE- PERSONAL WE STILL HAVE ISSUES AND PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE ALL COME FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WE ALL LOOK THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS. IT JUST IS. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DEBATE THESE THINGS BY YOU KNOW. THE TENSIONS EXIST BECAUSE WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO IT AS A DEMOCRACY. IS TO IS TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION AND FIGURE OUT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN SO NOW I'LL GET TO MINE- BASIC POINTS WHICH CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT PASSIONATE BUT VERY RELEVANT I HOPE. IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR OUR DISCUSSION THE ACA FIVE WILL GIVE VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE IF CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALLOW RACE AND GENDER TO BE CONSIDERED IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS. GOVERNMENT HIRING AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING NOT THE ONLY CONSIDERATION NOT THE DETERMINING CONSIDERATION JUST ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS IN A HOLISTIC VIEW. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE PROHIBITED THIS POLICY. BUT IN CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIANS UP WE'VE CHANGED OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES IT'S TIME TO ALLOW VOTERS TO ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO RE EVALUATE THE POLICY THE SAME WAY THEY DID FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN VOTERS REPEALED ANOTHER RELIC FROM THE NINETIES PROP TWO TWENTY SEVEN. AND RESTORE BILINGUAL EDUCATION BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THE STATE'S EDUCATION SYSTEM CAREERS IN PUBLIC SERVICE FAIR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT POLICIES. HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY POWERFUL AS MY COLLEAGUE OVER THERE- POINTED OUT TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS SOMETHING AND MANY OF US. ASPIRE TO. ACA FIVE WILL ENSURE ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD TO COMPETE FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. COLLEAGUES CO THE NINETEEN IN THE PANDEMIC IS FURTHER EXPOSED HEALTH DISPARITIES WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION BEING OFFERED. IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SYSTEMIC RACISM CONTINUES TO BE A STAIN ON OUR NATION HOWEVER HARD WE STRIVE AND TRY. IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IS INCREASING EXISTING INEQUITIES. AS WE WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WE HAVE TO TAKE EVERY CHANCE WE CAN TO PROMOTE OPPORTUNITY AND JUSTICE THEIR ASPIRATIONS. AND E CAN CONTINUE ALWAYS TO ASPIRE TO THOSE GOALS AND THE BEST NATURE. AS OUR COLLEAGUE DR WEBER HAS NOTED PROPOSITION TWO ONE NINE WAS HINDERED HAS HINDERED PUBLIC POLICY FORWARDED OPPORTUNITY AND MAINTAIN ECONOMIC DISPARITY LONG ENOUGH IT'S TIME TO GIVE VOTERS A CHANCE TO RIGHT THIS WRONG. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A CA FIVE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR PASSION AND VIGOROUS DEBATE SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT- MANY OF YOU BUT I'M OFTEN ASKED I ASSUME IT'S BECAUSE- I HELD PREVIOUS ROLES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE RUNNING FOR OFFICE I WAS STAFF OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST LOBBYISTS BUT I'M OFTEN ASKED WHAT I'M NOT SURPRISED BY NOW THAT I'M A SITTING MEMBER. ON I THINK IT HIT A- I HAVE WORKED IN DIVERSE SETTINGS WITH PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT BUT I AM MOST INTRIGUED. HOW A GROUP OF PEOPLE CALL THE LEGISLATURE CAN LOOK AT A COMMON SET OF DATA IN FACT. ANSWER MY LIFE SUCH DIFFERENT BANG. THAT WAS I REMEMBER BEING IN THE ASSEMBLY WHICH STRUCK ME THE MOST TO THE DEGREE THAT I TURNED AROUND ONE DAY ON THE FLOOR AND ASK MY CALL THE CONSENT BEHIND ME WHAT WAS HER SOURCE OF NEWS. BECAUSE I COULDN'T BELIEVE. THAT LISTENING TO THE SAME SET OF FACTS THAT I HEARD ON THE FLOOR. SHE COULD COME UP WITH SUCH A VERY DIFFERENT SUMMARY VIEW OF THE WORLD IS IDEA. I APPRECIATE YOU ALL SHARING YOUR STORIES WE ALL HAVE THEM. AND I THINK PERHAPS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS- CLEARLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RACE BECAUSE THAT'S- THE REAL CRUX OF THE PROBLEM WITH OUR COUNTRY. AN INABILITY TO USE ALL TO WITH KNOWLEDGE. THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY THAT IT WAS BUILT ON THE BACKS OF FREE LABOR. AND THE REASON THE HARD TIME HAVING THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. THAT IN ORDER TO SHARE POWER RESOURCES YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING UP. I GET THAT WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT. AND BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IT FEATURES IN THE SOMETIMES RELATED SOMETIMES ON RELATED SITUATIONS MUCH LIKE TODAY. BUT I APPRECIATE YOU FOR SHARING ALL YOUR STORIES OF WHAT INTRIGUED WITHMOST OF YOUR STORIES WERE FROM CHILDHOOD. HOWEVER SOME OF MY EXPERIENCES ABOUT. OVERT AND MY PROGRESS IN AGGRESSIONS AND RACES EXPERIENCE HAS WORKED SINCE BEING A MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT. QUESTIONS ABOUT. ME AND MY LIFE IN MY JEWELRY AND MY STYLE OF DRESS FOR MEMBERS OF THIS VERY BODY. SO WE REALLY HAVE WORK TO DO. BECAUSE PERHAPS WE NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH ONE ANOTHER TO BROADEN OUR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT FROM US. FOR WE CAN BE MORE LEARN IT IN UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT FROM US. WITH MANY PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF BEING THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM I WAS REMINDED OF AN AMAZING INTERVIEW I SAW ONCE CONDUCTED BY CHARLIE ROSE MANY INTERVIEWS. TONI MORRISON PULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR. AND CHARLIE KEPT PROBING HE WAS REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT HER LIFE EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY IN. THE LITERARY WORLD COME OFF IN A VERY LEE WORLD WHERE SHE'D BEEN A PUBLISHER. AND A KEPT PUSHING A COUPLE XIN AND SHE SAID. WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE IN CALL WITHOUT BATTING HER EYES. THAT THOSE SITUATIONS NEVER BOTHERED HER TO SHE WAS CLEAR SHE WAS INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR TO MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM IN HALF OF THE TIME. AND CHARLIE WAS STUNNED. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM. HIS PERCEPTION WAS THAT SHE WOULD FEEL LESS THEN UNCOMFORTABLE. AND IT WAS THIS MOMENT IN TIME WITH THE BOTH OF THEM LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OTHER IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE SHOULD FEEL LESS THAN SHE WAS CLEAR THAT HE WAS INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR THE MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM HALF THE TIME. FULLER THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HAVE THIS. POWERFUL CONVERSATION TODAY. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK MOMENT TO DIRECT EVERYONE TO THE SENATE FLOOR ANALYSIS FOR THIS BILL THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY OUR OWN CONSULTANTS SO WHAT'S IMPORTANT I BELIEVE IS ON PAGE TWO OF THE ANALYSIS. AND IT'S THAT IT PUT PROP TWO OH NINE PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN A HISTORICAL CONTEXT THAT REMINDS US OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN OUR STATE AT THAT TIME. AS THE ANNOUNCED. ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS INITIATIVE WHICH BECAME PROP TWO OH NINE WAS AN ANTHROPOLOGIST IN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM. BY THE NAME OF BILLION AFTER IT. AND IN A BOOK REGARDING HIS YOUR PROP TWO OH NINE ENTITLED COLOR BLIND CALIFORNIA'S BATTLE TO END AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. CUSTER DESCRIBED HIS JOURNEY TO UPHOLDING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AS A BORN OF HIS DISCOMFORT WITH DIVERSITY AND MULTI CULTURALISM. HE STATED AND I CALLED PERMISSION TO REPEAT. PERMISSION THANK YOU AS AN ENTREPRENEUR AFTER APOLOGISTS I KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT DIVERSITY YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM. WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO DEAL WITH IT IN THE MOST REALISTIC WAY. IN QUOTE. HE ALSO DESCRIBED MULTI CULTURALISM AS COLD TERRIBLY MISGUIDED. I WAS CONCERNED THAT A PEACEFUL AMERICA WAS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT A COMMON GROUND BETWEEN ALL AMERICANS WERE AMERICA WOULD FIND CUSTARDS COMMON GROUND IS UNCLEAR BUT APPARENTLY IT WAS NOT FOUND IN EITHER MULTI CULTURALISM OR DIVERSITY RATHER. THE TEXT OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS INITIATIVE COMMON IS IN THE OF DIFFERENCES OF COLOR BLIND AND GENDER BLIND SOCIETY. I WOULD ARGUE. LET ME JUST GO A STEP FURTHER. SINCE THEY INTERPRETED THE INTENTION OF PROP TWO OH NINE. THE CIVIL RIGHTS INITIATIVE WOULD NOT HAVE BECOME PROP TWO OH NINE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF MISTER WARD CONNELLY IN GOVERNOR PETE WILSON AND SINCE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE CHOSEN TO. INSERT PARTISANSHIP IN TODAY'S DEBATE LET ME JUST STATE SOME ADDITIONAL FACTS AGAIN I'M QUOTING FROM THE ANALYSES. IN LATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WARD CONNERLY AN ALLY OF GOVERNOR WILSON TOOK OVER IS THE CHAIR OF THE INITIATIVE. AND THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY GAVE THE K. GAVE THE CAMPAIGN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. GOVERNOR WILSON WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESS. THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT. HAD RECENTLY FOUND POLITICAL SUCCESS IN USING THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY PROP ONE EIGHTY SEVEN OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR PROP TWO TWO SEVEN. AS A WEDGE ISSUE TO DRIVE THE ELECTORAL SUPPORT FROM WHITE MAN. BOTH HONOLULU OFTEN FOCUSED ON THE NEED FOR A COLOR BLIND SOCIETY SPECIFICALLY THE OFFICIAL PROP TWO OH NINE BALLOT ARGUMENTS. GOVERNOR WILSON AND CONNERLY ARGUED THAT AND I CALLED. THE ONLY HONEST AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS ANY QUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY IS BY MAKING SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN ARE PROVIDED WITH THE TOOLS TO COMPETE IN OUR SOCIETY AND THEN LET THEM SUCCEED ON THE HAIR COLOR BLIND RACE BLIND GENDER BLIND THIS. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE INITIATIVES IN THE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION AND HOUSING AND HEALTHCARE. THAT FOLLOW THAT PERIOD TO SEE IF INDEED THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO CREATE. COOL OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN FALLING PROP TWO OH NINE UNDER MISTER WILSON DID MANAGE GEN. I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT WAS NOT. WHATEVER YOUR PERCEPTION OF WHAT A COLOR BLIND SOCIETY IS THE DATA SUGGEST WE ARE CURRENTLY NOT LIVING IN ONE. IN ACTUALITY THE DATA SUGGESTS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE THAT OUR SOCIETY IS DISTINCTLY ON EQUAL ALONG CLEAR RACIAL AND GENDER STRATIFICATION. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT MATH VERSUS FACT. YEAH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. NEFF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS NO LONGER NEEDED IN AMERICA MYTH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REWARDS THE ON QUALIFIED NEAR IT PROMOTES THE SINGULAR USE OF A RACE BASED LANDS OR QUOTAS AND LET'S BE CLEAR QUOTAS WERE ILLEGAL UNDER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FREE TO ALL NINE FOR THE CONFERENCE THE- A THIRTY. THAT THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA TEXAS THE QUOTA IS AN ACCURATE. THE REAL MYTH IS THAT WE HAVE AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD AND THAT THE MOST QUALIFIED PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO GET AHEAD THAT'S THE MATH. IN FACT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HELPS TO OFFSET BARRIERS THAT UNFAIRLY BLOCKED THE PATHWAYS OF QUALIFIED AMERICANS. WHO ARE FULLY ABLE TO SUCCEED IN SO DOING TO PROMOTE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. THE WORLD IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHOSE TALENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZED BY TRADITIONAL MEASURES OF EXCELLENCE. FOR EXAMPLE. THE DOCTOR CLEAN KING IS OFTEN QUOTED IN IN THE DEBATE AGAINST A CA LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE HISTORY ABOUT DOCTOR KING. ALTHOUGH HE WENT TO ALTHOUGH HE WENT ON TO BE ONE OF THE MOST GIFTED OR RAIDERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY DR KING SCORED VERY POORLY ON STANDARDIZED VERBAL TEST IN HIS YOUTH. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT SUCH TESTS IN SIMILAR CRITERIA ARE OFTEN BIASED. AND UNDER ESTIMATE THE CAPABILITIES OF WORKING CLASS INDIVIDUALS WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THAT THEY DO NOT ACCURATELY PREDICT PROFESSIONAL OR EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS. ENCOUNTERING BILL SCREAMIN NATION AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICIES OFFSET LIMITED MEASURES OF MERIT. AND IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHOSE TALENTS AND POTENTIAL MIGHT OTHERWISE BE OVERLOOKED. I KNOW THAT- MY WORDS AND DEEDS MAY NEVER CHANGE THE MINDS OF SOME. I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES. THE WORK WE STEPPED UP TO RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE PAST. SO LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT REPEALING PROP TWENTY NINE REALLY MEANS. HOW MANY MORE WOMEN TO POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP AND INVESTED IN WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES WHICH ARE LEFT OUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS EVERY YEAR. CREATING FAIR THIS IS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY GIVE WOMEN LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS AND OTHER MIND ETHNIC MINORITIES ACCESS THE PUBLIC CAREER JOBS AND GOOD BENEFITS. HOLDING THE EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ENSURING OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CAN OFFER A DIVERSE ATMOSPHERE THAT ENHANCES LEARNING AND ENCOURAGES MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. IT ALLOWS US TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN MORE TEACHERS OF COLOR. STANDING UP FOR CALIFORNIA VALUES AGAINST THE RACISM AND INTOLERANCE THAT MANY. ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE USED TO DIVIDE OUR COUNTRY. WHAT YOUR VOTE MEANS TODAY IN SUPPORTING A CA FIVE. IS THAT IT WILL ALLOW NOT JUST THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND WHO HAVE SIGNED A PETITION IN OPPOSITION TO IT BUT WILL ALLOW THE FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS. THE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. I MENTIONED A COUPLE OF THE INITIATIVES THAT WERE DURING THE SAME ERA WITH PROP TWO OH NINE IN I MENTIONED PROP TWO TWO SEVEN AND A REMINDER IF. SEVEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE NOW THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. BOUGHT THAT ISSUE BACK TO THE FLOOR TO TALK ABOUT. THE RACIST ANTI IMMIGRANT TENER IN THE STATE AT THE TIME. WHEN WE COULD QUALIFY AN INITIATIVE AND PASS THAT WITH SIXTY SOME ODD PERCENT OF THE VOTE AN INITIATIVE THAT SAID ENGLISH ONLY TO BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS. WELL WITH 75% OF THE BILL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT INITIATIVE WAS REPEALED. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MOVEMENT FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE IS NOT INEVITABLE. PROP TWO OH NINES INITIAL PASSAGE SHOULD BE EVIDENCE OF THAT SO COLLEAGUES WE MUST BE AFFIRMATIVE AND THE ACTIONS WE TAKE. TO BEYOND THE ARC TOWARDS JUSTICE I APPRECIATE THE FULL DEBATE TODAY AND I'M URGING YOUR FULL SUPPORT OF ACA FIVE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

BUT THEN WE TELL THEM THERE YOU DON'T EVEN ONE OF THEM BAY RIGHTS. ARE SO. THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THIS IS NOT HOW IT SHOULD BE. AND HONESTLY THIS DERIVES FROM A RACIST SYSTEM A RACIST CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AT A RATE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT FOR CENTURIES HAS WORKED VERY HARD TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM VOTING PARTICULARLY PEOPLE COLOR AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. OF OUR CONSTITUTION. AND FRANKLY CALIFORNIA IS IN EVEN IN THE LEAD ON THIS. THE VOTERS OF FLORIDA. MATHIS SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF ALL YOU WANT. AN OUNCE HER SUPPORT. THIS COMMONSENSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO REENTER GRAY AND TO RE ENTER SMOOTHLY WE WANT PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND I HEARD AND I. SENATOR NIELSEN. THAT PRESIDENT LADIES AND DOWN THE SENATE NOT SURE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE UNIVERSE WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. THEY INCLUDE MURDERS. VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER RAPE SODOMY. YES AND. LEWD LASCIVIOUS WITH THE CHILD. THIS IS THE PART OF THOSE WHO ARE CONVICTED. THAT WOULD BE IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT THOUGH MY GOSH THEY SHOULD VOTE. WELL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SHOE. CRIMINAL INJUSTICE BILLS AND BEGINNING TO CALL THEM. THINK ABOUT THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THE CHILDREN. AND YOUR OWN FAMILY WHO WILL BE THE PROPENSITY TO HAVE BE VICTIMIZED BY SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS PAROLE PEARL DOESN'T MEAN THAT ON OCCASION WHEN YOU THENRELEASED FROM CUSTODY. THEN YOU HAVE IN MANY CASES NOW ALTHOUGH IT'S BEING PRETTY WELL ABOLISHED IN ITSELF ALREADY PEARL BUT THE DEGREE THAT WE HAVE PEARL. AND THIS IS FROM THOSE WHO DO THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES OF FIVE JUST MENTION. A PART OF THEIR SENTENCE INCLUDES THE PAROLE PERIOD. OF THE JUDGMENT THE FREE SOCIETY. TO SEE IF DAY HAVE REHABILITATED SUFFICIENTLY. TO BE ABLE TO BE SAFE RISKS. AND THERE CAN BE APPEARED IT WERE IN THERE ARE UNDER SUPER AND SUBJECTED TO CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR BEHAVIORS. HOW MANY TIMES A DAY DO WE HEAR ABOUT PAROLEES OR EARLY RELEASES. COMMITTING HEINOUS CRIMES IT'S BECOME COMMONPLACE NOW. UNDER OUR NEW CRIMINAL JUSTICE SO CALLED REFORM. AND IT IS ABOUT JUSTICE JUSTICE JUST DESSERTS. FOR THOSE WHO COMMIT CRIMES PROTECTOR THE HEINOUS CRIMES. PART OF THEIR SENTENCE IS TO COMPLETE THE PAROLE PERIOD THEY ARE NOT A- TERMINATED FROM THEIR QUOTE SENTENCE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THERE FORMALLY DISCHARGED BY A FORMAL ACTION. OF DISCHARGE FROM PEARL. AFTER THAT I'M WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. BUT THEY HAVEN'T SERVED THEIR TIME. AND WHAT'S GONNA BE NEXT. WELL I THINK THOSE IN WHO ARE STILL INCARCERATED THERE WILL BE AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE THEM THE VOTE TO ABSENTEE MAYBE. MAYBE NOT MAYBE WILL HAVE TO GIVE THEM AN EARLY RELEASE SO THEY CAN VOTE. I HATE TO BE FACETIOUS ABOUT IT BUT I'M GETTING A LITTLE BIT TIRED OF THIS GUY'S OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THE PERFECT CHOICE ON SOCIETY. AS WELL AS THE VICTIMS GREAT INJUSTICES. THE GRIEVING VICTIM THERE'S NO CLOSURE THEY DON'T EVER GET OVER IT. THAT'S A LAUGH I'VE DEALT WITH FAR TOO MANY VICTIMS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. TO KNOW THEY DON'T GET OVER IT SOME IN MADE ADVOCATE TO SAID THAT THEY JUST HAVE TO GET OVER A- BOWL RAPED AND MURDERED. I DON'T THINK SO. AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO REALLY HARD WITH ONE I'VE USE ONCE HERE BEFORE BUT IT'S DEEP IN MY HEART. BEFORE WE HAD ANOTHER ONE OF THESE KIND OF BILLS. JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. I HAD A DREAM. AND WOKE UP IN THE NIGHT. THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN. WHO'S CRYING OUT TO ME FROM THE GRAVE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID TO ME. WELL SADLY I SAY I DO NOT. AND WHAT DID SHE DESERVE. WHAT DID HER FAMILY DESERVE. JUSTICE FOR THE ONE WHO PERPETRATED THAT ON HER. NOW WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THESE FOLKS EARLY RELEASE. AND WE'RE GONNA LEARN TO VOTE. I THINK NOT I VIGOROUSLY URGE A NO VOTE. SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU IN A PRESIDENT ON. INDEED. AS A MEMBER WHO HAS CARRIED A NUMBER OF BILLS TO RIGHT SIZE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO RIGHT SIZE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM NEVER HAVE I ONCE STOOD ON THE FLOOR AND SAID THAT A VICTIM SHOULD GET OVER IT NOT ONCE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON THE CONTENT OF THE BILL. THE BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EARLY RELEASE. THIS BILL SAYS ONCE YOU HAVE PAID YOUR DEBT TO SOCIETY. AND HAVE RETURNED TO SOCIETY. TO WORK AND PAY TAXES AND CONTRIBUTE. THAT YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOICE YOUR OPINION ABOUT YOUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES BASED ON WHERE YOU LIVE. THAT'S THE FOCUS OF A FEE A FIX. IN BECAUSE THAT'S THE FOCUS OF A FEE A FIX AND I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT. LIVING IN COMMUNITY PAYING TAXES SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND I HOPE THAT OTHERS WOULD BE CLEAR ABOUT THE NATURE OF THIS BILL. YOU WE ALL MAY HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WHETHER THE PEOPLE IN IT DESERVE ANY RIGHTS AT ALL. BUT AGAIN THE UPON RELEASE. HOW DO WE EXPECT PEOPLE WHO ARE RELEASED TO RETURN TO CIVILITY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO TREAT HIM AS SUCH. AND VOTING FOR OUR PERSPECTIVE THANKS TO THE BILL OF RIGHTS. AND THE US CONSTITUTION IS AN INALIENABLE RIGHT. AND THIS POPULATION SHOULD BE GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY I'LL BE SUPPORTING A CA SIX. SENATOR BURGESS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I THINK. WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS MENTION PAYING BACK THE DEBT TO SOCIETY HELLO BELABOR THIS POINT BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS WELL ARTICULATED BY MY COLLEAGUE. I'M CENTRAL VALLEY. AT FROM ILLEGAL SO PAYING YOUR DEBT. NECESSARILY AND- OFFER FILLING THE PERIOD OF TIME DURING THE PROBATION OR PAROLE. I WON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THAT BUT I THINK ONE THING THAT WE MAY BE OVER LOOKING HERE. IS THAT THE JAIL SYSTEM THROUGH REALIGNMENT THROUGH A NUMBER OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION. HAS DRAMATICALLY SCALE BACK THE TIME THE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING IN JAILS OR EVEN IN PRISONS- ARE FOR THAT MATTER. SO WHEN YOU HAVE IT IN ADMINISTRATIVE IN POSITION- WEATHERBY BY LAW OR- BUDGET. THAT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT PEOPLE ARE SERVING. FOR PURPOSES OF A SENTENCE. AND BEING PUT BACK INTO- SOCIETY IN RELIEF AND EARLY PERIOD OF TIME ON THE CONDITION OF PAROLE. THEY'RE SATISFYING REGIONAL. BOB OF THEIR SENTENCE THE DISALLOW THE VOTE TO OCCUR ONE IS GOING THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE. INTO THE POST SENS OBLIGATIONS OF PAROLE WERE SHORT CUTTING IT UNDER THIS GUY'S AT THE BOARDING SET THOSE CONDITIONS TO COMMUNITY AND THAT'S JUST OFF BACK ACCURATE. SO SOME OF US ARE LOOK AT IT AS A CIVIL RIGHTS IS. I IT OR EVEN JUSTICE FOR THAT MATTER. I WOULD JUST FOR THE FALL TWO WHAT ARE THE TERMS THE CAN. IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM NEED TO BE RESTORED ALL OF THE RIGHTS AFTER HAVING SERVED DESCENDS FOR THAT AFTER HAVING SERVED A PAROLE AND THAT BE THE GUIDING FRAMEWORK. THING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR BRADFORD YOU MAKE CLUED. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'M ALWAYS AMAZED WHEN IT COMES TO. PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS CHAMBER AND THE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY BUT YOU WANT THEM TO. SERVE A LIFE SENTENCE. YOU WANT THEM TO. BEAR THE MARK OF A FELON BURKE CONVICTED FELON FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BUT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT REHABILITATION WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON OUR PRISON SYSTEM WITH INTENTIONS AND THE PURPOSE OF A REHABILITATING. YEAH ONCE RELEASED YOU STILL WANT TO TREAT ON LIKE A COMMON. CRIMINAL IT'S AMAZING I WONDER IF. MY COLLEAGUES WITH A POLLS ROGER STONE OR MIKE LAND OR MICHAEL COLE AND FROM THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE ALL CONVICTED FELONS BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THEY WILL BE VOTING VERY SOON PROBABLY IN THIS UPCOMING ELECTION HE WON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT. BUT WE ALWAYS WANT TO. FEAR MONGER AND DRAW THE WORST SCENARIOS I SURE YOU THE AVERAGE MURDER OR RAPE IS. OUT OF PRISON THE LAST THING THEY PRIDE THING ABOUT IS RUSHING TO THE POLLS AND VOTING BUT THIS IS PART OF THE VOTER FRAUD THAT WE'VE BEEN PROPAGATING FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS. OF HOW THIS TAKES NEXT IS THE FAR THIS THING FROM THE TRUTH. PEOPLE WHO GO TO POLLS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR SCHOOLS THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN. BUT I CHALLENGE YOU AGAIN. IF THIS IS ONE OF YOUR RELATIVES PRETTY SURE YOU WOULD SAY. THAT IS OUR TO VOTE. THEY'RE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS- YEAH THEY'VE BEEN REHABILITATED THEY DESERVE THE VOTE. BUT WHEN IT'S BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WHEN IT'S POOR PEOPLE. THERE MARK FOR LIFE IN A HALF TO. AND MANY PEOPLE DIE SIR ALIVE SO. THE IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS IT'S LONG OVER. WE HAVE TO WITH SPOKE. NO CRIME ARE RUN OUT TRYING TO VOTE. WHO WHO ARE CAN CONCERNED THE COMMUNITY. THIS IS ABOUT RE ENTER. BEING I CAN. POSITIVE ROLE MODEL CONTRIBUTING MEMBER TO SEE.
