NUMEROUS OUR HEARINGS OF TESTIMONY AND REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE VERY HARD WORK -- THIS YEAR IS WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR UNVEILED HIS NEW BUDGET VERY EARLY ON IN JANUARY OF THIS VERY EXCITING. BECAUSE MUCH OF WHAT WAS DETAILED IN THE BUDGET I REALLY DID NOT CHANGE IN MAY. AND MANY OF THOSE PROPOSALS REFLECTED MUCH OF WHAT WE AS AN ASSEMBLY HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR WHETHER IT WAS. HEALTH CARE FOR MORE CALIFORNIANS OR INCREASING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OR ENSURING THAT WE HAVE -- MORE INVESTMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THOSE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD TO HAVE BEEN CHAMPING OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND IN PARTICULAR WERE VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE HAD AN INCOMING GOVERNOR WHO -- WAS LISTENING AND ABSORBING WELL WHAT LEGISLATIVE POWERS HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED THEM IN HIS JANUARY BUDGET SO THAT WAS A A GREAT -- A GREAT DEPARTURE I THINK FROM WHAT -- GOVERNOR BROWN HAD DONE IN THE PAST AND WE WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE IT. I IN PARTICULAR THAT YOU KNOW OUR ASSEMBLY -- BUDGET HAD A COUPLE. MAJOR AREAS WE WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON RESTORING MANY OF THE BUDGET CUTS ESPECIALLY IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AREAS WHICH WERE DONE DURING THE RECESSION UNFORTUNATELY -- THOSE PROGRAMS WERE. THE THE LAST ONES TO SEE RESTORATION SO WE WERE HAPPY THIS HAVE SOME PRIORITIZATION OF THOSE -- PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN OUR VERSION OF THE BUDGET -- WE ALSO PRIORITIZE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AS YOU KNOW OUR SPEAKER THECONVENE A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. THE STUDY THE ISSUE FOR OVER YOUR CAME WITH NUMEROUS RECOMMENDATIONS -- WE DECIDED TO MAKE SURE THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION INVESTING IN CHILDREN EARLY ON WAS ALSO A MAJOR PRIORITY. WE HEARD FROM -- Q. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS THAT THIS IS -- THERE AT THAT WE DID NOT INVEST ENOUGH IN. THEM -- WE A PARTICULAR FOCUS TO OUR OUR FUNDING IN INCREASING AND HAVING MORE MONEY FOR FOR K.

BROUGHT OUT A CONVERSATION BOTH YOUR HUMOR AND THIS -- SHARP WIT OR SOMETHING THAT I ENJOYED WATCHING AND I DID WATCH EVERY MOMENT OF SOMEONE IT'S SOMETHING I'VE. ALWAYS ENJOYED DOING. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT AN ADVOCATE FOR A FEW OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME BEFORE SUB ONE THAT YOU APPROVED AND IF I MAY I REALLY JUST WANTED TO TALK ABOUT. HOW EXCITED I AM FOR THE PROPOSALS THAT WE CAN ADVOCATE FOR HERE TODAY? FOR MANY OF US WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR HEALTH FOR ALL AND THAT VALUE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND I'M EXCITED THAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS TAKEN THE FIRST STEPS TO PUSH. TOWARDS THAT GOAL AND THERE ARE EXPANDING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO ALL YOUNG ADULTS. I'M ALSO -- HAVE BROUGHT BEFORE THE ISSUE REGARDING THE AGEDAND DISABLED PROGRAM AND HOW THERE'S A BARRIER TO ACCESS -- AND HOW AND HOW THIS INVESTMENT WILL HELP OUR AGED AND DISABLED TO ACCESS CARE. WANTED TO TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY IF I COULDTHE NEED FOR BEHAVIORAL -- EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CURE NAVIGATORS MANY TIMES PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO. AND THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW HOSPITALS. TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF HIRING THESE PEER NAVIGATORS AND THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO RE HIRING ON AFTER THE GRANT. IT'S A PROGRAM THAT'S SHOWING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS -- AND RESULTS HERE AT UC DAVIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. MAY OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT YOU MENTIONED REGARDING FRIDAY NIGHT LIVES MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. MEDICAL INTERPRETERS AND TRAUMA SCREENINGS ARE LONG OVERDUE AND HELP US TO INCREASE ACCESS. REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE HAVE HAD AN EPIDEMIC REGARDING STDS OR S. T. EYES -- HABSI AND THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR GOING INVESTMENTS WHICH WILL IMPLEMENTINNOVATIVE PREVENTION STRATEGIES IS LONG OVERDUE. IN REGARDS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. I WAS IMPROVE I'M IMPRESSED WITH THE INVESTMENT IN THE EARLY PSYCHOSIS GRANTS SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY SEEING OUT OF NEW YORK SHOWS THAT THESE INVESTMENTS MAY HELP OUR STATE TO RECOGNIZE THOSE SAME RESULTS. THE ONGOING INVESTMENT IN THE INNOVATION INCUBATOR SPECIFICALLY WITHIN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT MAY ALLOW COUNTIES TO REALIZE AND RECOGNIZE WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE. IN ADDITION THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR INCENTIVE GRANTS TO COUNTIES THAT ARE ON GOING WILL ALSO ALLOW COUNTIES TO CONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND FIGURE OUT WHT OUR BEST PRACTICES. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING I WAS. PLEASED TO SEE THE INVESTMENTS IN THE M. S. S. P. PROGRAM WHICH HELPS US TO SAVE MONEY AS A STATE AND ARE LONG OVERDUE FOR A RATE INCREASE. AS WELL AS THE INVESTMENT IN THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM. MANY OF OUR SENIORS LACK AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET A WARM MEAL AND THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM MAY BE THE ONLY WAY THEY DO. AND SO WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THAT. WE HAVE ADVOCATED FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS FOR RESTORATIONS OF SOCIAL CAMPAñA RECKON THEM PLEASE THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT IN. AND LOOK FORWARD TO HOW WE CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ID DE COMMUNITY IS REPRESENTED AND IS HEARD HERE IN OUR STATE CAPITOL. I WANT TO MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IF I CAN AND TALK ABOUT A PROGRAM. THAT I WAS PROUD WE GOT DONE LAST YEAR IN WHICH I RECEIVED A FRESH SHE FOR BUT IF I CAN I WANTED TO SHARE THE FRESH SHE WITH YOU IN A COLD ASK AS BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES IT'S THE WORK OF THE STAFF WHO. PUTS IN ALL THE EFFORT THAT MAKES THIS DONE. CASH OUT EXTENDS. FOOD STAMPS TO FOUR HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND SO THE PERMANENCE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SEEN AND CREATING A PROGRAM THAT MAKES SURE WERE. PROVIDING BENEFITS TO ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO SEE HIM. THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT JUSTICE FELLOWSHIP WHICH IS -- GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE FUNDED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WILL ALSO HELP THOSE TO DEFEND AGAINST -- IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS. WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE THAT DEFENSE PLAYS AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE HEARD IN A COURT OF LAW. AND WAS PLEASED THAT THIS FELLOWSHIP MAY ALLOW PLACES LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO RECOGNIZE. THE SAME BENEFITS TO COURT REPRESENTATION THAT YOU COULD GET IN LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCISCO. I TO WANT TO TALK ABOUT CAL WORKS A PROGRAM THAT TOO OFTEN AFFECTS WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. AND THE EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE PUT IN TO HELPING THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM. TO MAKING THIS PROGRAM APPLY NOT TO JUST FIRST TIME MOTHERS OR MOTHERS -- UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX BUT TO ALL MOTHERS. AS WELL AS THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON CAL WORKS THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD AND IN TERMS OF THE ASSET TEST. THESE ARE STRONG WAYS THAT WE CAN BENEFIT THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM BENEFITS WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. FINALLY I WANTED AND WITH TWO IF I COULD. AND ITS FIRST. THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW OR FASTER FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT A SOCIAL WORKER INSTEAD OF CONTACTING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. WILL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED AND THE TIME THAT THEY NEED. I BELIEVE THAT THE FAMILY OR TO RESPONSE SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR BUT GOVERNOR BROWN. AND I'M PLEASED THAT WE FOUND IT WITHIN OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE GOVERNOR HOPEFULLY ADOPTING THIS. ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. BUT I WANTED TO END WITH THE YOUTH AND FAMILY CIVIC ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVE WHICH IS PUSHED BY THE LOTUS WORK DONE THE MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR FREEDOM CENTER. THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUTH AND FAMILY IS GETTING INVOLVED IN ADVOCACY OF SOMETHING THAT'S NOT LOST ON ME. I GREW UP HAVING LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A VOICE AND FIGHTING FOR THOSE WHO DON'T. AND IT'S PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THAT CONTINUE. TO INVEST IN FUTURE ADVOCATES THAT WILL ALLOW COMMUNITIES TO FEEL. LIKE THIS GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR THEM.

AND HER BIG ABILITY TO DIG REALLY DEEP AND GET BEYOND THE THAT THE SURFACE TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT OUR GOALS WERE WHAT HOW THIS WAS PARTICULARLY UP IMPACTING THAT AND WITHIN THAT WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS? THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY HAS HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN TO ENSURE IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES. AND GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY OVER PROGRAMS AND EXPENDITURES WE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. AND WHETHER NOT THEY ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT WE SET AND BEING VERY HONEST ABOUT WITHIN THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY REDUCING RECIDIVISM OR WHETHER PEOPLE JUST COMPLYING WITH PROGRAMS WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE OUTCOME. SO WE HAVE VERY GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT IN VERY GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO USE A DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE. BASICALLY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT -- AMONG OUR MANY ACTIONS WE APPROVE THE TRANSITION OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FROM CDC ARE TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AB AND THAT IN ITSELF WAS A A A QUITE A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE OF THOUGHT AS A COMMITTEE THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE SUCH A MAJOR MOVE. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE CREATED ADVISORY BODY TO ADDRESS YOU'VE DELINQUENCY THROUGH A TRAUMA INFORMED REHABILITATION FOCUS LANDS. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE TRANSITION BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DONE RIGHT. AND THAT WOULD JUST NOT MOVING FROM ONE BUILDING TO THE NEXT AND CARING THE SAME PROGRAMS FORWARD AND IN THE UP WITH THE SAME RESULTS. WE'VE ALSO MADE A CRITICAL INVESTMENT TO ADDRESS THE HIGH RATE OF DEATH OCCURRING FROM DRUG OVERDOSES IN OUR PRISONS -- BUT WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO IT IN A MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WILL DELIVER THE BEST RESULTS. ADDRESSING THE FLOW OF DRUGS INTO THE PRISON SCALING THE TREATMENT IN A WAY WHERE CDC ARE CAN SUCCESSFULLY REDUCE OVERDOSES AND ENSURING THAT COUNTY PARTNERS ABLE TO PROVIDE TRANSITION SUPPORT ONCE A PERSON IS RELEASED. TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN OUR COURTS WHICH IS BEEN AN ONGOING CHALLENGE BY THIS COMMITTEE AND WE'RE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR AS WELL.

SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED EVERY YET EVEN THOUGH IN PROVIDING THE TWENTY FIVE WE STILL A SHORT IN TERMS OF THE JUDGES NEEDED AND STATE TO ENSURE. THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE ACCESS AND THEREFORE ADEQUATE JUSTICE. UNPRECEDENTED DISASTERS HAVE REQUIRED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN DISASTER RELIEF IN RESPONSE. WE PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED MILLION INVESTMENTS INCLUDING PRE PUT THE PRE POSITIONING OF FIRED EQUIPMENT WE ALSO SUPPORTED UPDATING THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND THE COMPLETION OF THE EARLY EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEM.

REINSTATING AUDITING AND INVESTED KATORI FUNCTIONS OF THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL AND PILOT I'M PILOTING PRE TRIAL SERVICES IN IN TEN COUNTIES. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO WORKED SO HARD IN THIS ALL OF THOSE WHO CAME TO THE HEARINGS IN MAY TESTIMONY BEFORE US AND THE ADVOCATES WHO OBVIOUSLY MET WITH ME MANY TIMES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD. JUST HOW IMPORTANT THEIR PROGRAMS THAT WERE AND HOW IMPORTANT FUNDING WAS THAT WE WERE PROVIDING THEM -- IF FOR MORE INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY LOOK AT THE REPORT THAT A LONG LIST OF THINGS THAT WE FUND IT I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT ME TO READ THOSE GUYS WILL GLOSS OVER -- BUT I'M JUST WANT TO THANK OUR THOSE STAFF AND EVERYONE WHO WORK WITH US TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN VERY POSITIVE OUTCOME THIS YEAR THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU DOCTOR MR OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR. IN THANKING EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR I REMAIN CONVINCED THAT CRAFTING THE BUDGET IS THE SINGLE MOST INFLUENTIAL THING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE DOES EVERY YEAR. DISTRIBUTING THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER REVENUE HAS PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS SO IMPORTANT IN THE ASSEMBLY -- SO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THE BUDGET -- I THINK THAT FOR THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE BUDGET PROCESS THEY DON'T REALIZE HOW MUCH WORK IT IS TO SERVE ON A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE BUT IF YOU TAKE A JOB SERIOUSLY AND I'M CONVINCED EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM DOES -- IT IS A LOT OF WORK AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR HER WALK EFFORTS AND THE STAFF THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING THEM. I ALSO ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS IS THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE IN THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET THIS YEAR. I I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY IT IS A MUCH MORE FISCALLY PRUDENT BUDGET THAN THE ONE THAT'S EITHER COMING OUT OF THE SENATE OR THE ONE THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND I THINK THOSE ARE -- REALLY GREAT THINGS -- HOWEVER I HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS. AND ONE OF THE MOMENT TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT I LIKE -- THE THE GOVERNOR ISLA REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE ASSEMBLY FOR PUSHING BACK ON THE ADMINISTRATION IN CHARACTERIZING SOME OF THE EXPENDITURES AS ONE TIME. I THINK THE GOVERNOR TOLD US ALL THAT 11% OF THE SPENDING INCREASE WAS ONE TIME AND 89% I'M SORRY WHAT ONLY 11% WAS -- ONGOING 89% WAS ONE TIME. AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS AN UNFAIR CHARACTERIZATION BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT A SUNSET ON SOMETHING LIKE ON AYE HSS PROVIDER. RATE INCREASE OR A TEST SALES TAX EXEMPTION FOR DIAPERS AND TAMPONS WE KNOW THAT THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE ROLLED BACK IN FUTURE YEARS SO. TO SAY THAT THAT'S ONE TIME EXPENDITURE IS -- IS I THINK NOT REALLY CHARACTERIZING IT RIGHT AND TO THE FOR THE MOST PART THIS BODY WHEN WE CRAFT OUR BUDGET HAS RESISTED THE TEMPTATION TO DO THAT. AND I REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S A GREAT THING. ALSO I AM VERY THANKFUL THAT WE ARE TAKING THE THREAT OF RECESSION AND ITS CONSEQUENT IMPACT ON STATE REVENUE SERIOUSLY IN THIS BUDGET WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PRUDENT VESTMENTS AND OUR STATE RESERVES -- IF DEPENDING ON HOW THE DUST SETTLES I THINK WE'RE GONNA WIND UP AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVE. WHICH WILL BE THE LARGEST RESERVE IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY. THOSE ARE GREAT THINGS HOWEVER I ALSOTHINK WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL THAT THE LA -- TELLS US THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE IN A MODEST RECESSION ABOUT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF OVERALL REVENUE LOSS. AND EVEN WHEN YOU BALANCE OUT THINGS LIKE THE DECLINING IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEES THAT STILL GOING TO HAVE AN OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLAR IMPACT ON OUR BUDGET SO. TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT WE ARE ABOUT IF IF OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE TO WHETHER A MODEST RECESSION WITHOUT CUTTING PROGRAMS WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY THERE. SO -- IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE ON THIS PATH AND I WANT TO CONTINUE TO TO DO THAT. I ALSO WANT TO TALK AGAIN AS I HAVE IN THE PAST ABOUT THE WAY THAT THOSE RESERVES ARE STRUCTURED. THE THE JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS AGO WE ONLY HAD A SINGLE STATE RESERVE FUND THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. AND THERE IS A PROVISION IN STATE LAW THE SAYS THAT WHEN THE BALANCE IN THE SFE YOU GETS ABOVE 3% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES. STATE SALES TAXES OPPOSED TO GO DOWN ONE QUARTER OF A PERCENTAGE POINT. AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA A BREAK ON SALES TAX IN YEARS WHEN. THE STATE HAS A LOT OF REVENUE AND I WE'VE CREATED LOTS OF DIFFERENT RESERVES NOW THE RESERVES ARE SOCIAL SAFETY NETS RESERVE CREATED BY THE VOTERS. BUT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT HAS BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT SEEN THAT SALES TAX RIGHT RATE CUT AND I REALLY STRONGLY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD -- I JUST WANNA TAKE ONE MINUTE TO TALK ABOUT EDUCATION FUNDING BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN VERY FRUSTRATED ABOUT. THIS BUDGET FUNDS A MODEST INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA K. TWELVE EDUCATION SPENDING IT'LL BE ABOUT. TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT WHEN -- THIS BUDGET PASSES. TO PUT IN CONTEXT THAT'S FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION EVEN WITH THAT INCREASE. AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING. K. TWELVE EDUCATION FUNDED AT THAT LOW LEVEL ARE MANIFOLD WE ARE FORTY SIX THE AND READING TEST SCORES WERE FORTY SEVENTH AND MATH WE HAVE THE LOWEST. STUDENT TO TEACHER RATIO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE I KNOW EVERYONE AGREES THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE -- WE HAVE A BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT -- MISTER CARTY AND I AM MISTER MERCHANTS YEAR OLD JOIN AUTHOR OF ITS A. B. THIRTY NINE THAT STATES THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO RAISE THAT. PER STUDENT SPENDING RATIO UP TO AT LEAST. THE MIDDLE OF THE AVERAGE FOR STATES. BUT THAT IS NEVER GOING TO GET DONE AND LESS WE HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO IT AND EVERY TIME THAT WE FIND ANOTHER PROGRAM. AND IT'S VERY SEDUCTIVE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WE TALK BOUT SCHOOL BREAKFAST WE TALK ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS BUT EVERY TIME WE FIND ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE TAKE AWAY DOLLARS THAT WE COULD HAVE SPENT. TOWARDS MEETING THE PRIMARY COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I REMAIN VERY FRUSTRATED ABOUT AND I'M HOPEFUL IN FUTURE YEARS THAT WE CAN TAKE STEPS TOWARDS. REMAINING THAT SITUATION SO -- THIS BILL THIS BUDGET OBVIOUSLY HAS SOME GOOD PARTS AND SO BAD PARTS -- I WILL BE OF STANDING ON THE VOTE IN THE HOPES THAT WE CAN WORK OUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE OBJECTIONS TO IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE PROCESS BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THE BUDGET AND FOR ALL OF THE BUDGETS SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF THAT WE SERVE WITH. THANK YOU MISTER FOSTER I THINK IT'S A REMINDER THAT THE OVERALL WITHIN THE BUDGET THERE'S A MOST OF IT WE AGREE ON AND THE LARGE MAJORITY THAT WE AGREE ON OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL. SOME DIFFERENCES AS YOU AS HIGHLIGHTED -- TO IRON OUT THAT BUT AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT. OF THE THREE BY JUST THIS IS THE MOST FISCALLY PRUDENT BUDGET -- AND IT'S ALSO THE BUDGET THAT AGAIN HAS PRIORITIZE EDUCATION THE MOST. AT THE SAME TIME IS REALLY PREPARING US FOR THE FUTURE. WITHOUT I KNOW DOCTOR WOULD HAVE TO QUESTION AND THEN MISTER COOPER. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND I AND MY QUESTION WAS AND I ACTUALLY YOU WERE ABLE TO POINT OUT TO ME AND THAT WAS REGARDING THE IN CO TAX EXTENSION -- I KNOW I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT IT'S ON PAGE SIX OF OF OF OF THE OVER HERE. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO ONCE AGAIN -- POINT OUT THAT -- BY NOT PURSUING THE EXTENSION WE AS THE ELLIE ALWAYS PUT IT -- IT HAS THE EFFECT OF LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE I FEDERAL MONEY ON THE TABLE AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE NUMBER PROGRAMS -- ALTHOUGH OUR BUDGET -- IS IS DOING. MORE INVESTMENT IN IN TRYING TO BRING PROGRAMS BACK -- TO PRE RECESSION LEVELS -- BY LEAVING FEDERAL MONEY ON THE TABLE -- IT'S IT'S IT LIMITS THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PROGRAMS AND WE SIT THROUGH HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS OF TESTIMONY FROM REALLY GREAT ABOUT REALLY GREAT PROGRAMS. THAT SERVE OUR SENIOR POPULATION THAT SERVE THE ID D. S. CAN BE IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO MANY OTHERS. THAT HAVE BEEN OPERATING ON ON RECESSION ERA CUTS -- AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO MANY PEOPLE WHICH I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT. WE SEEM TO BE LEAVING THE OTHERS BEHIND AND I AND I AM I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND I HOPE THAT -- WE CAN AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE THE MCO TAX RESTORATION I THINK -- WE WE DEBATED THIS A MOST THE PEOPLE ON THIS DíAS WERE HERE WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS A FEW YEARS AGO THIS IS A RENEWAL OF SOMETHING. THAT WE DEBATED IN THIS IN THIS HOUSE AND IN THE SENATE. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE WE TRY TO RESTORE THAT -- FOR THE INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM -- AND TO HAVE AND AND TO FIND WAYS TO IT TO FIND ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS AS WE GO FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOUNG THE FILE ALLEY -- OR ON FINANCE ONE COMMENT AT ALL. MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF COUPLE QUESTIONS ON G. G. R. F.. WHAT PROGRAMS BE FUNDED AND AT WHAT LEVEL SPECIFICALLY THE AG THIS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM IN THE DAIRY METHANE PROGRAM? I'LL REPEAT IT IS SPECIFICALLY THAT DIESEL REPLACEMENT PROGRAM IN THE DAIRY METHANE PROGRAM. I AM TERESA COVER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE ASSEMBLY PLAN FOR A G. G. R. F. -- THERE IS ZERO DOLLARS. FOR EXCUSE ME ZERO DOLLARS FOR MESSING REDUCTION THERE IS -- COULD YOU REPEAT THAT THE OTHER PROGRAM YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE JURY NOTHING PROGRAM. AND THE ACT IS A REPLACEMENT AG DIESEL OR PLACEMENT -- I DIESEL REPLACEMENT IT'S UNCLEAR THERE'S FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE ASSEMBLY PLAN FOR CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE WHICH IS WHERE THE AGRICULTURAL DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT UPGRADE PROGRAM RESIDES BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MUCH IS ALLOCATED FOR THAT SPECIFIC PROGRAM AT THIS TIME. THE SENATE APPROVED FUNDING FOR THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN DURING THAT SAME REDUCTIONS BUT A SPECIFIED THE FUNDS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT. WHAT IS THE SIMPLEST PLAN? I WE ARE REFLECTING ZERO DOLLARS FOR THE METHANE REDUCTION IN THE ASSEMBLY PLANT. OKAY -- THE FUNDS AMOUNTS FOR JERRY METHANE REDUCTION SHOULD BE SHOULD NOT BE SPECIFIED CURRENTLY ALL FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED BY CDFA FOR BOTH ALTERNATIVE MANEUVER MANAGEMENT AND JERRY DIED JESTERS. IS IMPORTANT FOR BOTH SETS OF PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED TO BE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR CDFA TO MAKE THE DECISION ON THE PREP PROJECTS THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED. I CANNOT MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS TO JUST ALTERNATE MANURE MANAGEMENT. WE BOTH JERRY DIED JESTERS AN ALTERNATE MANEUVER MANAGEMENT PROJECTS TO MEET THESE GOALS. SO THE FUNDING THE PLANTS NOT SPECIFY BUT INSTEAD ALLOCATE THE FUNDS TO SEE THE FAA THE BEST PROJECTS CAN BE SIX A CHOSEN. TRULY WHAT ACTIVITIES REDUCTION GOALS READ ALLOCATE A HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HER THREE FIVE MILLION FRAG THESE REPLACEMENT IN NINE NINE BILLION FOR DAIRY METHANE REDUCTIONS. THANK YOU. EXCUSE MISTER CORPORATE CHRISTIAN GRIFFITH ASSEMBLY BUDGET JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE WAY THE ASSEMBLY PLANT WORK WE DIDN'T HAVE. SPECIFIC SET ASIDE WITH THE SENATE AND THE MYSTERY SHOULD WE HAD MORE KIND OF BROADER CATEGORIES WITH FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SMART AGRICULTURE -- WE DIDN'T SPECIFY HOW THAT WOULD BE USED THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY PLANT HAD A LARGER AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION WHICH HAD. WHICH ENVISIONED MONEY -- FOR THE H. P. PROGRAM WHICH IS FOR HEAVY AND DAD MEDIAN VEHICLES AND SOME OF THOSE VEHICLES ARE AG SO INSTEAD OF HAVING NECESSARILY AT A SPECIFIC PROGRAM FOR AG IT'S MORE OF A GENERAL PROGRAM WHICH COVERS AND PARADE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF VEHICLES FROM PORT VEHICLES. TO TRUCKS AND TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE GENERAL SUPPOSED TO SPECIFIC TO AN INDUSTRY SO THAT WAS SORT OF PART OF THE GENERAL APPROACH TO GO TO CONFERENCE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WERE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION SO THAT YOUR YOUR POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN. THANK YOU [inaudible] MS JONES. INSIDE THE NO WERE. WOULD PROBABLY MOVING TOWARD THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO CONGRATULATE A DEVICE CHEERFUL TEAM HOPE FOR CONFERENCE COMMITTEE CHAD MAYES -- KEVIN MCCARTY. A JAIL WINNER OF THE INDUCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER. FIVE MY FAVORITE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. AT LEAST THIS WEEK. AS WE MOVE TOWARD CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- THERE'S ALWAYS THIS. THIS DICHOTOMY BETWEEN THE SENATE BUDGET IN OURS AND ONE OF MY ONE TO POINT OUT IS IS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE ADOPT THE SENATE PACKAGE. ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND MOVING TOWARD THAT AND REALLY IS ABOUT RESTORING THE STATE ALLOCATION. LIMITS -- IS ABOUT NINETY MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE COURTS WILL BENEFIT FROM -- IF YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE SOUTH FUNCTIONS AS A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. NOW AGAINST COURTS WHICH IS MANAGEMENT AND UNIONS -- A PREDICTABLE FUNDING SOURCE TO COLLECTED BILLION BARGAIN IT REVISED FISCAL STABILITY AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AS A LOT OF MEMBERS HAVE -- EXPELS TO RIGHT NOW AND IT GIVES THE COURTS EACH DEBILITATED JUST THERE -- THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR THE NORMAL COST OF DOING BUSINESS INCREASES -- WANTED THINGS I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT FOR EXAMPLE THE COURT REPORTERS. I'VE ONLY HAD ONE INCREASE IN SALARIES OUT AND ALMOST A CENTURY WITH THE LAST ONE BEING IN -- NINETEEN NINETY EVEN WITH THIS -- ONLY PROVIDE ABOUT A TWENTY SEVEN CENT. INCREASE IN THEIR SALARIES AND SO FOR REALLY. SERIOUS ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IN AND OUR COURTS INADEQUATELY FUNDING THEM THIS IS ONE WAY TO DO THIS AND SO I'M I'M RECOMMENDING THAT WE SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT ADOPTING THE SENATE ACTION -- I WILL I LABOR IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH LEADERSHIP TO MAKES. A SERIOUS PUSH AS WE MOVE TOWARD GETTING THE ADMINISTRATION. TO LOOK SERIOUSLY AT OUR BUDGET AND COMING CLOSER TO TO WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING -- ARE SELLING AT THANK -- BECAUSE I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS. I'M NOT ONLY WITH WITH DOCTOR WEBER BRIEF CONVERSATION I ONE ONE THANK CHAIR MISTER CHANG FOR FOR MEETING WITH ME LAST NIGHT ALL DAY LONG AND IN. DOING BILLS AND AND MEET WITH ME IN THE EVENING TO GO OVER THIS SUBJECT -- I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THAT AND THEN THE SPEAKER FOR PUTTING ME TOGETHER WITH HIS BUDGET. PUBLIC SAFETY ON INDIVIDUALS TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THIS PACKAGE OF NINETY MILLION DOLLARS AND SO THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER WITH THE SENATE -- TO MOVE THIS BOARD -- SO HOPEFULLY YOU MAY HAVE SOME IDEAS OF HOW WE CAN GET. GET THEIR SPECIAL AGO -- DEPARTMENT FINANCES LOOK AT ME KIND OF FUNNY RIGHT NOW BUT SOULFUL WE CAN. WE CAN DO WE CAN MAKE READ IT WOULD THEY ALL LOOK AT ME FUNNY SO IT DOESN'T MATTER -- BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND AND EIGHT AND FROM THE EARLY DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD -- EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE EACH YEAR TO FIND A WAY THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS. FOR THAT WOULD GET YOU GOT THAT BLANK LOOK SO OKAY. NOT NOTHING IN COMMON WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- ONE OF THINGS I WELL ONE COMMON ON APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY PLANT IGNORE JING THE MCO TAXES DOCTOR WOULD IS. HAS SAID IT THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENT I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN MENTIONED IN HEARINGS THE COMPLEXITY. BUT THE DEVASTATION IT'LL KERR IF IT IS REMOVED -- THAT'S LEAVING ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ON THE TABLE AND IT NEEDS TO BE A THOUGHTFUL PROCESS GOING FORWARD -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALSO IN IS. KIND OF THE OIL FROM THE ROOM WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE IDEA DE COMMUNITY IS. IS THE THE RATE PLAN THAT CAME OUT IN THE END OF MARCH. STE STATING THAT IT'S ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS SHORT IN FUNDING -- THE ID POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE SINCE IS CONTINUING TO RISE DRAMATICALLY WITH OUR OUR POPULATION BY DD FOLKS -- I DO APPRECIATE OUR CHAIRS OF SUB ONE AND OR OR ARE BUDGET SHARE GREG KNOWLEDGE IN. AND STANDING UP FOR THE POPULATION. GOING FORWARD. HOME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS. ESSENTIALLY. IS BASICALLY WHAT KIND OF BLUEPRINT IT WILL BE BUILT. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DESPERATE NEED FOR FUNDING. THROUGH THE RATE PLAN WHICH IS. THREE YEAR STUDY. WE PAID A LOT OF MONEY. FOR THE NOW SAYS YES. WHICH WE ALREADY KNEW YOU DO HAVE A DESPERATE NEED TO FUND. THIS UNDERSERVED POPULATION. WHAT WILL WE EXPECT TO SEE COMING FORWARD? IN THE UPCOMING YEAR BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO COME IN NEXT YEAR AND SAY. WELL LET'S START RIGHT NOW. WE KNOW IT'S HERE WHAT IS THE PLAN TO BACK FILL THIS ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR KNEE. TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE -- TO GOING TO SOME DETAILS OF THE FIRST IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION -- IN RESPONSE TO THE RATE STUDY INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND AND TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE YEAR AFTER THAT SO WE'RE SEEING THIS. AS A PHASED IN PROCESS YOU KNOW WE FIGURE WITH A SYSTEM THIS COMPLICATED AND SERVING THIS MANY PEOPLE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THINGS IN THE RIGHT WAY. AND SPECIFICALLY THIS INCREASE IN THE BUDGET YEAR IS FOCUSED ON A NUMBER OF CORE PRIORITIES MAKING SURE THAT WE STABILIZE THE RESIDENTIAL POPULATION. MAKING SURE THAT WE ENSURE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM AND MAKING SURE WE ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN RATES BETWEEN VENDORS AND CENTERS ACROSS THE SYSTEM -- AND AND AS MENTIONED IN THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST THAT RATE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR REFORMS IN THE SYSTEM AS IN MANY OF OTHER OTHER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOME STRUCTURAL PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND IN OUR MAY REVISION COMPARED TO WHAT WE SAW IN JANUARY -- AND THAT'S THE REASON THAT THESE RATE INCREASES OUR SON SIDE. IN THE NAY REVISION -- PURSUANT TO THOSE PRESSURES BUT THE BROADEST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS WE SEE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED OVER SEVERAL YEARS WE'RE COMMITTED TO THOSE REFORM EFFORTS AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU ON HOW TO DO THAT. SO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT NOT RECOGNIZING AND AGAIN THE SUNSETS I CAN SEE. THE INTENT BUT THE POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW AND ABOUT 10%. A YEAR. AND SO WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN THE SYSTEM NOW. EACH YEAR THIRTY THREE THOUSAND MORE [inaudible] OKAY SO. NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE NOW WE'RE FUNDING LESS EVERY YEAR IF WE DON'T EVEN STAY TO THE THE 10% MORE POPULATION. INCREASES. A ONE OF THE THINGS ALSO. WE'RE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING IS A THE THE SERVICE COORDINATOR OF POPULATION IS ABSOLUTELY. CRIMINAL HOW A HUNDRED I DE. INDIVIDUALS ARE SERVICE BY ONE SERVICE COORDINATOR IN SOME REGIONAL CENTERS. THE OTHER IS THE LACK OF PROVIDERS FOR THE POPULATION THE WAITING LIST THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO WAIT SOMETIMES ONE TO TWO YEARS TO EVEN GET A DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER. IF AT ALL. SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AN EFFORT. TO CREATE A CAREER PATH. NUMBER ONE OR SOME KIND OF CERTIFICATE LEVEL. IT WAS MAKE MORE THAN. LIVING ARE MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. AND INCENTIVIZE BECAUSE THERE'S NO REASON FOR PROVIDERS EVEN THINK THAT THEY WANT TO HELP THIS POPULATION IT'S OUR SUNSETS. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS TO COME IN THERE IS A HUGE DESPERATE NEED FOR PROVIDERS WE HAVE ENOUGH PROFESSIONALS FOR ASSESSMENT. WE DO REAL WELL AT THAT. BUT WE DO NOT GET THE PEOPLE ON THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THERE ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE SERVICE. FOR THE WELL BEING OF THIS POPULATION I REALLY WOULD STRESS SO WE WORK TOGETHER. TO LOOK FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT GOES FORWARD THAT'S BEEN IGNORED FOR A LONG TIME. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SERVICE. THESE PEOPLE THE OF THE CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS MESSAGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANTED -- TO AGREEING WITH THE BUDGET VICE CHAIR [inaudible] THAT -- THERE ARE. A LOT OF GREAT -- TO STARTING WITH THE POSITIVES OF THE BILL A MAN IT IT'S IT'S FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE IT'S IS DEVOTING ITS IT'S HEARING THE CONCERNS RAISED BY A SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- IN TERMS OF THE TWO BIG BIGGEST COST PRESSURES FACING SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ARE PENSION COSTS IN A SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS. ARM. I WANT TO THANK THE THE GOVERNOR FOR PROPOSING. THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- AND THE ONE TIME PAYMENTS. TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- MEET THEIR CASTERS -- LIABILITIES -- BUT I I THINK THAT THAT HIGHLIGHTS. YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED. TO WE NEED TO HAVE -- ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM -- THAT THAT THE PENSION COSTS AND AND THE YOU KNOW HOW THOSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. YOU KNOW -- ARE. DOLLARS THAT -- THAT MAY NOT ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE SEEING BEING RAISED IN THE TEACHER STRIKES FROM LOS ANGELES TO OAKLAND TO SACRAMENTO -- AND AND AND AND SO YOU KNOW I I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE IT I KNOW IT'S AN AWKWARD CONVERSATION FOR FOR MANY OF US -- IN IN IN THE LEGISLATURE BED BUT WE NEED TO TO ADDRESS -- THIS ISSUE -- I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER. TWO FOUR FOUR INCLUDING THE K. THROUGH TWELVE FUNDING TARGET -- GOALS. IN THE ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THE BUDGET HI I HOPE THAT -- THAT IS WHO IS SURVIVED THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAIN -- AND ECHOING GO. THE THE THE BUDGET VICE CHAIR IS COMMENTS -- WHERE FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION AND AND THIS IS THIS IS -- IN A FOR US THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY WE NEED TO DO BETTER -- AND AND AND FUNDING OUR NUMBER ONE BUDGET PRIORITY -- K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION -- A PROGRAM THAT AFFECTS ALL COMMUNITIES -- ALL CHILDREN ALL FAMILIES THROUGHOUT STATE A CALIFORNIA. ARM. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. AN ONGOING CONCERN OF MINE WHICH IS -- OUR SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. A WHILE -- WE ARE INCREASING OUR SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IT DOESN'T GET AS CLOSE. TO WHERE WE WERE IN -- WHERE? CALIFORNIA USED TO BE ABOUT 70%. WE WOULD SUPPORT ABOUT 70% OF THE STATE BUDGET OF A OF THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA A CORE FUND -- BUDGET WE'RE NOW DOWN TO ABOUT 40%. THAT IS THE REASON WHY TUITION IS INCREASING THAT IS THE REASON WHY. THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S HAVING TO ADMIT MORE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS -- TAKING AWAY ADMISSION SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. AND SO -- ME TO ALL OF THESE. AGAIN AT YOU KNOW EVERY EVERY EXPENDITURE THAT THE WORKER -- ALLOCATING FOR NEW PROGRAMS -- IS IS OUR DOLLARS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM WHAT I BELIEVE SHOULD BE OUR NUMBER -- ONE PRIVATE BUDGET PRIORITY -- FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE AS WELL AS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OR THE LA -- IN TERMS OF THE THE PROPOSED THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE AL. FOR FOR YOUNG ADULTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS WHAT IT'S THE THE COST ESTIMATE FOR THIS EXPANSION. SO ALL TURNED OVER TO A COLLEAGUE TO GIVE YOU THE EXACT ESTIMATE FOR THAT BUDGET YEAR ONE POINT THAT I WANT TO SIZE IS FOR LOGISTICAL REASONS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. THE EXPANSION BEGINS ON JANUARY FIRST SO THE COST ESTIMATE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IS FOR A SIX MONTH PERIOD AND THEN THERE WILL BE AN ANNUALIZED COST. AFTER THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY. RYAN MILLER DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO -- UNDER THE MAY REVISION -- AS MY COLLEAGUE WAS SAYING -- WE HAVE INCLUDED NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS -- AND SEVENTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND -- THAT'S A PARTIAL YEAR -- COST -- AS ENROLLMENT -- WOULD INCREASE AND AND AS YOU WOULD REFLECT THE FULL YEAR COST -- I BELIEVE IT -- WILL INCREASE -- TO AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS. ROUGHLY AND AND WE CAN CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAIL ON THAT FOR YOU. AND SO I AM SURE IS A FORCE A SIX MONTH PERIOD OR YEAR PERIOD. THAT'S FOR A SIX MONTH PERIOD WE WE ASSUME -- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSAL NO SOONER THAN JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY OUR IS SO. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR A SIX MONTH PERIOD OH SORRY SORRY THAT THAT'S THAT'S IN -- A COUPLE YEARS ONCE WE HAVE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE PROPOSAL AND AND AND SO IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE INCLUDE NINETY EIGHT MILLION. TOTAL FUNDS SEVENTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE MAYOR VISION. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER PURCHASED SEVERAL WOMAN RIVAS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE WORK -- BUYER COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR LONG HOURS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE WE'RE ALWAYS PREPARED AND OF COURSE OUR OUR CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND SUB CHAIRS FOR PUTTING TOGETHER. A BUDGET THAT I THINK REALLY REFLECTS OUR STATE'S VALUES -- YOU KNOW AS WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SIGNIFICANT WORK DONE BY -- BUDGET SUB FOR COMMITTEE ON HOMELESSNESS THIS YEAR. INCLUDING THE HUNDRED THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OF LOCAL HOMELESSNESS FUNDING THAT WILL GO TO OUR CITIES -- WELL THEIR NUMBER OF AGENCIES AND TASK FORCES THAT ARE DOING GREAT WORK I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ROLE OF THE HOMELESS -- COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL WHICH IS OUR STATE ENTITY -- THAT WAS CREATED BY THE THE LEGISLATURE -- IT AND TASKED WITH PREVENTING AN ENDING HOMELESSNESS YOU KNOW THIS THIS COUNCIL OVERSEES IMPLEMENTATION OF HOUSING FIRST GUIDELINES IT IDENTIFIES RESOURCES BENEFITS AND SERVICES -- THAT CAN BE ACCESS TO PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. CREATES PARTNERSHIPS -- I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN INCREASE RESOURCES TO THIS COUNCIL -- BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDERSTAFFED -- IN EITHER OF THIS IS OUR STATE ENTITY. THAT MANAGES AND AND IS TASKED WITH -- YOU'LL FIND THE BEST PRACTICES IN OUR STATE -- TO END HOMELESSNESS -- SO YOU KNOW THIS IS A CRISIS BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE ON THE GOVERNOR'S WORK ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS AND ALL OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS I'M PREPARING 220-001-9220 ASSEMBLY BUDGET. I'M VERY THANKFUL. TO SEE THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET PRIORITIZE MANY CRITICAL ISSUES SUCH AS ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE RAISING FAMILIES OUT OF THE POVERTY WORKING TO FOR FURTHER EXPAND RESOURCES FOR HOMELESS POPULATION. WHILE MAINTAINING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CONTINUED TO BUILD RESERVES. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THINK. THE CHAIRS OF SUBCOMMITTEE ONE AND TWO FOR PART PRIORITIZING FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE BREAKFAST AFTER THE BELL AND DREAMER RESOURCE CENTERS. BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ONE I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO THINK -- THE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA AN ACTING CHAIR ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES FOR THEIR TIRELESS WORK -- IT IS REALLY A TOUGH PROCESS AND I CANNOT -- BE MORE PROUD THAN TO SERVE WITH BOTH OF THEM THEY ARE DILIGENT AND REALLY CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT CAME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE -- AND SOME OF THOSE ISSUES I THAT I'M THANKFUL FOR IS -- TO ADOPTING FUNDING TO EXPAND MEDICAL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS INCREASE WHICH RATES FOR SENIOR PROGRAMS AND EXPENSE SAFETY NET SUPPORT FOR THE INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITY. WELL WE HAVE MADE MANY STRIDES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I AM STILL HOPEFUL OVER THE FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS WE CAN CONTINUE TO FOR THE RESTORE. RECESSIONARY CUTS AND IN PARTICULAR WORK TO INCREASE RATES FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITY. THANK YOU AGAIN MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TO FINALIZE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL NO PRESSURE VOID WHERE DEPENDING ON YOU MISTER TING. TO MAKE OUR PER IS A PRIORITY FOR THE WHOLE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU KNOW NO PRESSURE AT ALL. MR MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I WANT TO THANK. THE SOMEONE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY COLLEAGUES THERE ARE STAFF THERE -- LOT OF HARD WORK A LOT OF HOURS PUT IN -- WORKING TO GET -- OUR IT DE COMMUNITY TAKEN CARE OF I KNOW NOT EVERYTHING THAT WE WANTED. GOT THERE I HOPE -- MISTER CHAIR AS WE GET INTO CONFERENCE WE CAN LOOK AT PUTTING A LITTLE MORE TEETH AND GET IN A LITTLE MORE FUN IN THERE -- BUT I DO HAVE -- A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT I'M OPEN -- THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER -- YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE A LOT TO INCREASE HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE ACCESS. AND AS WE GO FORWARD AND DO THIS MY LARGEST CONCERN IS I I REALLY HONESTLY DON'T THINK WE PUT ENOUGH AND ON THE PROVIDER SIDE. SO ON ONE HAND WE ARE INCREASING THE FLOCKS THAT'S GOING TO GO INTO OUR MEDIC HEALTH SYSTEM. IN VASTLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO GO ON TO THE SYSTEM. BUT WE'RE NOT DOING ANOTHER OFF. NEARLY ENOUGH TO INCREASE PROVIDERS. FOR THAT SYSTEM. A I KNOW WE'VE HELPED A LITTLE BIT WITH HOW MUCH THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA GET BACK IN AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK. BUT AS FAR AS GETTING MORE PROVIDERS. OUT THERE. A AND I'M TALKING MORE DOCTORS MORE NURSES IN IN DOING THESE THINGS WE HAVEN'T. ON ANYTHING VERY SUBSTANTIVE. AND I HAVE A FAST CONCERNED THAT WE'RE GOING TO FLOOD THE MARKET AND WE ALREADY HAVE ISSUES WHERE. WHEN FAMILIES GO TO SEE THEIR PRIMARY CARE? THEY'RE ALREADY WAITING WEEKS. AND NOW I HAVE CONCERNS IT'S GONNA BE MONTHS. SO SO I HAVE A QUESTION ON THAT -- THEY IN THAT I HAVE -- OTHER QUESTIONS REGARDING AND IN HOMELESS SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT ONE AND THEN WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT. SO I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN TURNED OVER TO ADAM DORSEY MY COLLEAGUE SO THE FIRST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS WE RECOGNIZE THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE ARE MORE DEMANDS ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM -- UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT -- WE ADDED MORE THAN THREE MILLION PEOPLE TO MEDI CAL PROGRAMS AND OVER A MILLION PEOPLE TO COVER CALIFORNIA SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE TAKING PART THE INSURANCE. MARKET -- I DO BELIEVE THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND NAY REVISION THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE EVEN IF WE KNOW THAT WE ALL HAVE MORE TO DO IN THE YEARS. TO COME -- THE FIRST IS UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX MAKING SURE THAT WE DEVOTE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO INCREASING PROVIDER RATE SYSTEMATIC CAL TO MAKING SURE THAT. MORE PROVIDERS ARE SERVING MEDI CAL PATIENTS WE WERE DOING A LITTLE BIT THERE BUT AS AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES ALREADY DOCTOR WITH THE MISTER FRAZIER. YOU'RE LEAVING A LOT OF THAT MCO FUNDING. STILL ON THE TABLE. THAT WE COULD BE ACCESSING THE INCREASE PROVIDERS [inaudible] IN. THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE NEED TO GET MORE DOCTORS. SO I MEAN IT'S GREAT THAT YOU GUYS RECOGNIZE IT BUT I MEAN ARE WE GONNA DO SOMETHING TO INCREASE THE ABILITY. FOR GRADUATION RATES FOR DOCTORS AND NURSES YES SO -- THE SECOND THE THE SEVEN POINT ONE NINETEEN IS THAT ALSO UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WE'RE DEVOTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR LOAN REPAYMENTS FOR THOSE DOCTORS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THOSE DOCTORS THAT WILL SERVE MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE PATIENTS SO. WE HAD A LOT OF MONEY THERE IN JANUARY WE PUT AN EVEN MORE MONEY IN THE NAY REVISIONS SO THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO SPEND PROPOSITION. FIFTY SIX MONEY -- AND THEN ONE OTHER POINT AND I KNOW ADAM MAY WANT TO WEIGH IN AS WELL IS SPECIFICALLY ON MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE THERE'S A SPECIAL WORK FORCE NEED -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN IN THE NAY REVISION WE'RE PROPOSING AN EXTRA HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACTIVE FUNDING. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ATTRACT MORE PROVIDERS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH FIELD SO THAT IS A SPECIFIC AREA OF FOCUS WE KNOW IT'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT WE CAN SOLVE IN ONE YEAR BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BUDGET REFLECTS AN EMPHASIS ON THAT PRIORITY. WELL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU GUYS ON THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- MY OTHER QUESTION. TO YOU IS IN REGARD TO THE HOMELESSNESS THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR HOMELESSNESS HOUSING. AND MONEY GOING BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY REALLY ADDRESSING THE TRUE PROBLEM WITH HOMELESSNESS AND THAT'S DOING THE TRANSITIONAL PROGRAMS. TO HELP OUR HOMELESS POPULATION TRANSITION BACK INTO LIVING IN HOMES. AND TRANSITION BACK INTO BEING UP TO GET JOBS AND DO THAT. SO I REALLY INTERESTED -- INTO WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS IN REGARDS TO TRANSITIONING ARE HOMELESS POPULATION BACK INTO SOCIETY. IT'S A TOPIC THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITHIN SOMEONE -- BUT DIDN'T GET ANY TRUE CLEAR ANSWERS ON WHAT TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO FIND OR HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE GOING TO PUT INTO TRANSITIONING -- IN THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE CAN WE CAN TAKE SOMEBODY WAS HOMELESS AND PUT ON A HOME PLATE ALL THE STUDIES SHOW THAT THE END UP LIVING IN TENTS. AND IT ESSENTIALLY DESTROYING THE APARTMENTS THEY GET PUT INTO BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST NOT READY FOR IT YET. AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S FUNDING GOING TO HELP THEM TRANSITION OVER. I FOR GOING TO TRULY HELP THAT POPULATION. I THINK THAT'S IT PERSPECTIVE THE ADMINISTRATION REALLY DOES APPRECIATE AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION TWO POINTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION BUT I THINK ADDRESSES SOME OF THOSE POINTS. THE FIRST IS THAT ARE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION -- I'M SORRY HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL A LOT OF THE TENSION CAME TO THE OVERALL INCREASE TO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY KNOWING WHICH I KNOW MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY OF ALSO. EMBRACE THAT FIGURE BUT WE ALSO MADE SOME CHANGES IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAM DESIGN ITSELF AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TO IN PARTICULAR. FIRST IS THAT WE EXPANDED THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE FUNDING THAT WE ARE GIVING -- TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- BEFORE THERE WAS A REAL FOCUS ON SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS AND WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. BUT TO YOUR POINT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE THAT TRANSITION IS DIFFERENT FOR EACH PERSON IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR DOES WANT TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE THROUGH HIS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED TASK FORCE FOR THE COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL DECISION MAKERS HAVE THAT. FLEXIBILITY AND THEN THE SECOND THING WE DID IN OUR BUDGET AND WE RECOGNIZE THIS MIGHT BE AN ISSUE FOR CONFERENCE. IS THAT WE ALSO GAVE FUNDING NOT ONLY TO CITIES AND CONVENIENCE OF CARE BUT TO COUNTIES AS WELL BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THAT TRANSITION. ARE PROVIDED THROUGH COUNTIES THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IS ON HOLD PERSON CARE PILOTS AND THESE ARE REALLY PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ACCESS TO SERVICES AND JOB TRAINING AND EVERYTHING TOGETHER. WE HAD A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE ADDED ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS NAY REVISION BECAUSE WE THINK YOU REALLY DO NEED TO ADDRESS THE WHOLE PERSON TO GET AT THESE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT. OKAY AND WITH THAT I KNOW SOME OF THAT IS GOING A AS YOU SAID -- BREAKING IT DOWN IS SPLIT INTO WITH THE COUNTIES -- I DO HAVE CONCERN ON HOW THAT SPLITS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE IT'S PUT IN OUR ROLE COUNTIES IN JEOPARDY IN MAKING THEM COMPETE FOR SOME OF THOSE FUNDS -- AND I HELD DURING THE MAY REVISION PROCESS YOU ALL CAN LOOK AT HOW TO SPLIT THAT -- IN A FAIR WAY AMONGST THEM THAT WAY THEY DON'T WANT TO COMPETE FOR THOSE FUNDS -- THE BIG THIRTEEN AS THEY'RE CALLED DON'T HAVE TO COMPETE IT THEY GET IT UP FRONT WHICH HELPS THEM AND PUT THEM STEPS AHEAD. BUT OUR ROLE COUNTY IS -- ONLY GET A PIECE OF THE PIE AND THEN THEY GOT A FIGHT OVER THE REST. AND THAT DOESN'T REALLY HELP THEM OUT IT REALLY HARD FOR THEM ON THE PLANNING SIDE. SO WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THAT MISTER CHAIR -- AS WE GET TO CONFERENCE. PLAY DO APPRECIATE THE THE GOVERNOR LOOKING AT THE TRANSITIONAL PIECE -- IT AND I'VE GOT ONE MORE DAY SHIFT GEARS ON YOU GUYS -- THE SWITCH BACK OVER THE AG SIDE -- THAT MISTER COOPER -- TOUCHED ON I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS WITH THE ZERO DOLLARS ADVOCATE YOU DID -- ON THE DERRY METHANE SIDE -- I REPRESENT THE DAIRY CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. AND I'VE SEEN THESE PROJECTS WORK VERY VERY WELL AND MOVE FORWARD TO HELPING US REACH. OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. BUT IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. AND AND GETTING IT ISN'T GOING TO HELP US GET THERE. AND AS WE ALL HEAR ON THE NEWS OVER AND OVER AND OVER. NOT TO JOKE WITH THIS IDEA THAT CALIFORNIA'S ARE CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING -- THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE WAY IT WORKS IN WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE THAT METHANE. IN USE IT IS NATURAL NATURAL GAS -- WHICH IS ACTUALLY MORE BENEFICIAL OVER ALL AS RENEWABLE FUELS SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT IT JUST DID AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE MAY REVISE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- WILL BE GOING TO ARMS RACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE GOOD IN SOME OF THE BAD WILL TELL YOU ONE OF THE BEST THINGS. IS THE SUPPORT STAFF.
