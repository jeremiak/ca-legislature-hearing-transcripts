I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING YEAR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORK WITH MY OFFICE AND I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES DRAFTED AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THE BILL. AB SIX SIX SIX IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD PROPOSAL INSPIRED BY THE SITUATION THEMY COLLEAGUES AND I WHO REPRESENT MULTIPLE COUNTS EXPERIENCE EVERY ELECTION SEASON. ALL START BY EXPLAINING WHAT AB SIX SIX SIX MEANS TO ME. SIX COUNTIES. SIX DIFFERENT FORMS TO FILL OUT AND SUBMIT. AND SIX DIFFERENT WAYS TO SUBMIT ALL THAT PAPERWORK. THIS BILL TODAY IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD FINDING A WAY TO STREAMLINE THIS OVERWHELMING PROCESS. FOR NEW AND NOVICE CANDIDATES WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE DAUNTING AND COMPLICATED STEPS TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. I'M WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTIONS OFFICIALS SECRETARY OF STATE AND MY LOCAL ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO ENSURE. THAT WORK WHERE WE GO WITH A B. SIX SIX SIX IS COLLABORATIVE. YOU MAY THINK I'M CRAZY FOR TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE. EVEN TO CHALLENGE ME. BUT I PLAN TO PURSUE A REASONABLE SOLUTION THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US REGARDLESS OF PARTY BACKGROUND OR RESOURCES. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OUR WITNESSES WHO ARE STILL. WITH SOME THOUGHTS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER SILVIO FRYING HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION CLERKS ELECTION OFFICIALS OUT REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INVOLVEMENT ON THIS ISSUE A WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION BUT THE AUTHORS OPPOSITE AND REACHING OUT TO A SINCE LAST YEAR WHICH WE.

MICROPHONE RIGHT. OUTSIDE JUST RIGHT HERE IS GREAT YEAH. YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE GREAT MORNING MY NAME'S MICHAEL FEINSTEIN A FORMER MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBER IN SANTA MONICA COFOUNDER THE GREEN PARTY AND CANDIDATE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. I WANNA RAISE SINCE THE SECT THIS BILL DEALS WITH THE SECTION OF THE CODE DEALING WITH CANDID STATEMENTS I WANNA RAISE THE VOTER RIGHTS ISSUE. THAT THE CURRENT TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE FOR THE CANDID STATEMENT PER WORD MAKES THE COST PROHIBITIVE FOR A LOT OF CANDIDATES AND. THAT'S A VOTERS RIGHT TO KNOW OUR CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS SAYS THE. POWER IS ALL IN HERE IN THE PEOPLE AND YET VOTERS WHO GO TO THE POLLS DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A BASE LEVEL OF INFORMATION ABOUT ALL CANDIDATES ON THEIR BALLOTS. THAT'S A PROBLEM SECOND THE SECRETARY OF STATE ACTUALLY SETS THE FEE YET WITH SECRETARY OF STATE IS SAYING THE FEE. THAT WOULD THEN POSSIBLY RECRUIT PRECLUDE OR UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF A CANDIDATE RUNNING AGAINST THE SECRETARY OF STATE. TO HAVE A FULL CANDIDATES STATEMENT THAT'S A DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTERESTS AND INAPPROPRIATE SO I'M HOPING YOU'LL DO DURING THE COURSE OF THIS BILL. IS TO LOOK AT AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD LOWER THE FEE AND LOOK AT IT NOT FROM A TRANSACTIONAL DYNAMIC WHICH SAYS ALL THIS IS A GREAT BARGAIN FOR A CANDIDATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A. CANDIDATE STATEMENT IN THE IN THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE OR IN THE COUNTY GUIDES BUT INSTEAD THIS IS A RIGHT FOR ALL VOTERS TO HAVE A BASELINE SET OF INFORMATION. AND AND THAT'S REALLY I THINK A PRINCIPAL THAT UNDERLIE OUR DEMOCRACY I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND I SPENT THREE AND A HALF YEARS AS A RESIDENT REFINED CITY AND MISS THOSE DAYS YEAH. IF THE GREAT CITY OF MUCH SO WITH THAT I THINK A QUICK BREAK BECAUSE I BELIEVE A WARM AND SUGGEST MADAM SECRETARY TO TAKE THE ROLE. BERMAN HERE BERMAN HERE HARPER PRESENT HARPER HERE CULTURAL. LOW. MULLIN. PATTERSON PATTERSON HERE WEBER HERE WEBER HERE WE HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A AND I THINK YOU FOR FOR WORKING WITH WITH MY OFFICE IN MY TEAM ON I'M MAKING A COUPLE TREES I JUST WANNA CONFIRM BECAUSE. I DIE MADE THINGS A LOT MORE COMPLICATED. LATE IN THE GAME THAT. COMMON UBER FIVE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FOR THIS BILL SUGGESTS AN AMENDMENT THAT LIMITS THE APPLICATION OF THIS BILL TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE ERROR IN THE CANDIDATE STATEMENT FORM. DOES NOT DEPRIVE THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL OF INFORMATION NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW WELL I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT SENTIMENT. THE SLIGHT TWEAK THAT I SUGGESTED THAT I THINK WE RAN BY OUR OFFICE DONE PRIOR TO THE HEARING IS THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE BILL CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT AN ELECTIONS OFFICIAL FROM REJECTING A FORM. THAT HAS BEEN POSTED TO THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE BUT THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO ALLOW THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM A CANDIDATE IF NECESSARY. TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW SO THEY CAN'T REJECT THE FOREMAN OR STOP A PERSON FROM FILING FOR AND I CAN FOLLOW UP RIGHT IN THE SENATE THE FRUSTRATION THAT I FOUND IN PERSONALLY MYSELF MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND WE ARE GOING. SIX COUNTIES AND EACH IT EACH EMAIL WEBSITE WERE DIFFERENT YEAH. AND THEN YOU WOULD GO IN WITH THE FORM OFF THE WEBSITE NEVER SO THOSE INCORRECT ONE AND THEN JUST START A WHOLE PROCESS SO. I THINK MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS HERE IN THIS BUILDING I THINK THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILE ONCE YEAH WHEN YOU HAVE NUMEROUS CUT COUNTY SO. PRINCES ASSEMBLYMEMBER BIGELOW HAS LIKE ELEVEN COUNTIES AND HE'S GOT TO DO ELEVEN DIFFERENT FORMS AS WELL AS MISTER DALI SO.

NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE TO BE ABLE TO A MOTION I'LL SECOND. WE PLEASE CALL ROOM. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BERMAN AYE BERMAN AYE HARPER AYE. HARPER AYE CALLED THE ROOM. LOW. MULLIN. PATTERSON PATTERSON AYE WEBER. WEBER I. OKAY SO THAT YEAH AS A FOR A VOTE AND AND WE'LL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER SAT ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. AND NEXT UP WE HAVE. MR STEINORTH WITH A. B. SIX SIX FOUR. MORNING. YOU WERE YOU WERE CLOSE TO IS THE WORD SKATING CLOSE TO SIX SIX SIX A CLOSE BY AND WE WE GOT THERE JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME. MONOPOLY EVIL HERE YEAH FAVOURITE FIRST ONE TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AYE MR TURNED MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THINK CAUCUS STAFF AND GIVE ME THAT A COMMITTEE STAFFER REALLY WORKING WITH US TO TRY AND. MODIFY THIS BILL SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL BE ACCEPTABLE FOR EVERYONE HERE. AB SIX SIX FOR ITS INTENT IS TO CLARIFY THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT FOR CAMPAIGN INVESTIGATIONS. I'M SO I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT CURRENTLY PREVENTS A CANDIDATE'S SPOUSE OR DOMESTIC PARTNER FROM RECEIVING CAMPAIGN FUNDS. BUT A LOOPHOLE HAS LED TO A LACK OF CLARITY IN AT PPC INVESTIGATIONS. BECAUSE THERE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF LOS NOT EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT. TODAY THE LEGISLATURE'S ABLE TO PROVIDE CLARITY FOR CALIFORNIAS CAMPAIGN INVESTIGATIVE BODY BY CODIFYING COMMON PRACTICE. IT IS OUR DUTY TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS DO NOT USE OUR CANDIDACY TO UNDULY ENRICH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. SERVING IN ELECTED OFFICE IS A PRIVILEGE AND OUR CONSTITUENTS DESERVE THE UTMOST TRANSPARENCY IN HOW CANDIDATES CHOOSE TO SPEND THEIR CAMPAIGN DOLLARS. BY ELIMINATING THIS LOOPHOLE IN THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EMBRACE TRANSPARENCY FOR BOTH OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND FOR THE F. PPC. I AM JOINED TODAY BY NICOLAS HIGH TORN FROM THE COMMON CAUSE A NONPARTISAN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ELECTION TRANSPARENCY. THE ONE THING THAT A GREAT THANKS VERY MUCH. SHARE MEMBERS NICKEL SITE ON WITH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE FIRST HAVE A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STACY MONEY SIMILAR FACES IS ALSO NEW FACES. ARE COURSE THE PURPOSE OF SOLICITING CAMPAIGN DONATIONS A SLOW CAN IT'S GET THEIR MESSAGE OUT TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. FOR WHY THEY SHOULD BE ELECTED. IF I CAN THAT WE'RE TO POCKET CAMPAIGN FUNDS IT WOULD BE NOT ONLY DISPIRITING TO THE MARK SEE WOULD ALSO OPEN THE DOOR TO CORRUPTION BECAUSE IN ANY DONATION FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS. BE DIRECTLY ENRICHING THAT CANDID INTENSELY FUTURE ELECTED OFFICIAL. OF COURSE FOR THAT REASON CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS CAN IT'S FROM A HEIGHT REACHING THEMSELVES OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS AS LONG. AS WELL AS OUR SPOUSES. AND OF COURSE SO IT'S NO BIG STEP THOUGH TO SEE WHETHER BE SIMILAR CONCERN WITH PEOPLE IN REACHING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. I IMPOSING A LIMIT OF REQUIRING PEOPLE TO HAVE ACTUALLY PERFORM SERVICES AND RECEIVING A MORE THAN FAIR MARKET VALUE HELPS LIMIT THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT ABUSE. IT ALSO GIVES THE EFFICACY MANAGEABLE STANDARD OF SENSHI REQUIRING HONEST PAY FOR HONEST WORK. BUT AS COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES CORRECTLY NOTES THIS. BILL CODIFIES AN AS EASILY MORE MENTION THIS CODIFIES EXISTING PRACTICE FOUND IN THE FTP SEES HARDEN ADVICE LETTER. A WE THINK CONVOCATION MAKES AND THAT SENSE IN THIS CASE PERSON PROVIDES MORE NOTICE TO REGULATE COMMUNION CAMPAIGNS THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WITH LOCAL CAMPAIGNS WHO. WON'T HAVE OFTEN WON'T HAVE PAID PROFESSIONAL STAFF TO HELP THEM. A SECOND PROVIDES MORE PROTECTION FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT RULE BY CODIFYING THIS. YOU PROVIDE MORE SECURITY THAT THE SCHOOL WILL CONTINUE BECAUSE OF COURSE VICE LETTERS CAN COME AND GO AT THE U. PLEASURE OF THE COMMISSION. FINALLY LASSEN ONE MENTIONWHICH IS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED WITHIN THE COMMITTEE HOUSES IS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF HARDENED GENERALLY SAYING THAT ALL CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES MUST BE FAIR MARKET VALUE. AS NOT VITIATED BY PASSING THIS BILL THAT WOULD OF COURSE CONTINUE INTO FACT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO PREVENT CRONYISM. OR OTHER TYPES OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE ABUSE NOT RELATING TO MEDIAN FAMILY MEMBERS FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK THERE'S A VALUABLE ADDITION POLITICAL FOR MAX AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OPEN UP THE COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISS HARPER. WHAT I THINK? I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BACK I THINK THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR WORK. I IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION. THANK MR ARBOR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I'M JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE IN AGAIN IF I COULD JUST. EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR COMMITTEE STAFF AND WORKING WITH US INTO THE CHAIRMAN FOR HELPING US BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD THANK YOU. MOVE THE BILL. SECOND. THEN AND NOW EXPRESS MY THANKS TO YOU MR STEINORTH FOR YOU KNOW IT WELL LENGTHY DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL AND IN COMMITTEE AND OUTSIDE A COMMITTEE AND. YOU KNOW REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH MY STAFF WITH ME OVER THE BREAK TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON. AND IF I CAN'T USE HIS CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO PAY A FAMILY MEMBER FOR CAMPAIGN WORK IT IS IS REASONABLE ON AN APPROPRIATE TO EXPECT THAT THE AMOUNT PAID WILL BECOME ANSWER WITH THE WORK THAT'S PERFORMED. AND THAT'S THAT ALSO CONSISTENT WITH LONGSTANDING FD PC ADVICE SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED IN COMMON SUMMER FIVE NUMBER SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. AND WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY WILL YOU PLEASE CULTURAL OR GOT A CALL VOTE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN AYE BERMAN AYE HARPER AYE. HARPER AYE CALDERONE. LOW. LOW AYE MULLIN. PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE WEBER. WEBER AYE. SO THE VOTERS FROM THE FIVE ZERO WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR DISMEMBER SAT ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT WE HAVE. AB THREE OH SIX BY AS A MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER. ALL THAT GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. AND THINK YOU. AND AYE YOU WANNA START ACCEPTING COMMITTEE SUGGEST AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY A THE DESIGNEES FAILURE TO RETURN ABOUT WITHIN THE TIMELINES IMPOSED BY THIS BILL. AND THAT THE BALLOT IF IT'S OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE WOULD. STILL BE ELIGIBLE I'M I THIS IS JUST A CLEANUP BILL FROM. FROM A BILL WE DIDN'T TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT ALLOWS BASICALLY THE VOTER DECIDE WHO TURNS IN THE BALLOT THAT THEY CAN DESIGNATE ANYONE TO TURN IN THEIR BALLOT IT'S IT'S A A PERSONAL CHOICE. IN WHAT IT SAYS IS THOUGH THAT THAT PERSON HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO TURN IT IN WITH IN TWO DAYS WHEN WE INITIALLY WROTE THE BILL. WHEAT WE REALIZED AFTERWARDS THAT THE ONLY. REQUIREMENT OF COURSE WAS THAT IT IS TURNED IN BY ELECTION DAY. THE PROBLEM CAN BE WITHOUT OF SOME BE HOLDS ON TO IT LONG TOP TWO LONG IN THE VOTER GOES ON TO SEE THAT THEIR VOTE WAS REGISTERED ONLINE. THEY COULD START TO BE ENSURE GET NERVOUS AND AND WE SHOULD HAVE SOME CERTAINTY IN THE SO WE WANT TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE APPROPRIATE TIME. IT SHOULD TAKE A PERSON A VOLUNTEER A NEIGHBOR A FRIEND A FAMILY MEMBER. TO GET THAT EITHER IN A MAILBOX OR TO THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE SO. RESPECT LASTED ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OPEN UP THE COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISS HARPER. I THINK VERY MUCH A IS YOUR CALL AT SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR BILL INITIALLY I'M. AND I STILL REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THIS IS A IT IS IS A POTENTIALLY INCOMPLETE AFFECTS. UNIQUE ALSO REQUIRES THE DESIGNATE TO UPON THE REQUEST THE VOTER PROVIDE THE VOTER WITH A RECEIPT THAT INCLUDES THE NAME OF THE DESIGNATION. THE DATE AND TIME OF THE COMPLETED VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT THAT WAS RECEIVED BY THE VOTER. THE DATE AND TIME OF THE ELECTION BY WHICH THE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT IS BEING VOTED. THE NAME IN THE ARE OF THE POLITICAL PARTY CANDIDATES AND COMMITTEE FOR WHICH THE DESIGNEES ACTING. AND A TELEPHONE NUMBER AYE IT WHICH TO DESIGNATE MAY BECAUSE. CONTACTED. A STATEMENT THAT THE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT WILL BE DELIVERED WHICH WILL ACTION PISTOLS WITHIN THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR DEADLINE. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO AMEND YOUR BILL TO BE ABLE INCLUDE THE FULL PART OF THE I WILL BILL THAT THIS IS INDEED SUPPOSED BE MODELED NOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO. ADD ANOTHER BARRIER TO PEOPLE TURNING IN YOUR BALLOT THIS ASSEMBLY A AND I I ACTUALLY DON'T RECALL IN AND PERHAPS WHERE HEAVY TO DEBATES WHETHER WE MODELED AFTER IOWA WE MIGHT NOT A TIME PERIOD OUT OF IOWA I'M WE MODEL THIS BILL AFTER. COLORADO AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE THEY'D ACTUALLY DON'T HOW THE TIME PERIOD WE WENT LOOKING FOR. A FIX TO THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT IS BALANCE OUT THAT NEEDS TO MAKE VOTING AS EASY AS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE BARRIERS FOR THE VOTER TO MAKE IT CONVENIENT. TO NOT REQUIRE A STAMP TO TO ALLOW FOLKS TO VOTE ON SAME TIME SOME CERTAINTY FOR THE VOTER AND AND THAT'S THE THE FACT THAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO CHECK UM. YOU KNOW THEY THEY CAN SEE THAT THERE BALLOT HAS BEEN RECEIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND AND THERE THERE'S NO CONFUSION OR OR THERE IS CONFUSION BECAUSE THERE'S THEIR BALLOT WENT MISSING. SO THIS IS JUST TRYING TO IT TO TIGHTEN UP THAT TIME FRAME. AYE I THINK THAT THE FULL RECEIPT ISSUE WOULD CAUSE ANOTHER BARRIER ONE WHICH IS SOUNDS KIND OF REASONABLE AND BECOMES VERY ARTIFICIALLY. UNNECESSARY A VOTER IS AN ADULT WHO CAN MAKE THE DECISION ON WHETHER THE PERSON THEY'RE ASKING THEM TO TURN IN THEIR BALLOT THEY TRUST TO DO THAT. THAT WE TRUST THE VOTERS I THINK TO MAKE THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN THE FIRST ASSEMBLY RACE HELD SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE PREVIOUS BILL ALLOWING ANY PERSON TO PICK UP AND DELIVER VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. REPORTS SURFACED IN THE MEDIA OF OVERLY AGGRESSIVE VOTE BY MAIL DESIGNEES HARASSING IN COURSING VOTERS INTO HANDING OVER THEIR BALLOTS. IN RESPONSE ASSEMBLY WOMAN ALREADY GONZALEZ FLETCHER. DEMOCRAT FROM CHULA VISTA PLANS TO CLEAN UP LEGISLATION NEXT SESSION. AT THE VERY LEAST SHE SHOULD CONSIDER LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS IN A SCENE R. SINGLE PERSON MAY COLLECT AYE MAY COLLECT. AND REQUIRING BALLOTS TO BE TURNED AND SWIFTLY BY ELECTION DAY MORE BROADLY LAWMAKERS SHOULD REASSESS THE WISDOM OF ALLOWING UNLIMITED AN UNVERIFIED THIRD PARTY COLLECTION. BEFORE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAMPAIGN BEGINS IN EARNEST AND VOTER SHOULD BE ALWAYS WARY. OF STRANGERS OFFERING TO BEAR AWAY THEIR BALLOTS THAT I EDITORIAL WAS CALLED DON'T ALLOW VOTER PORTION AND CORRUPTION TO TAKE HOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MISTER HARPER. IT I'M SORRY IF I'M IF I MAY CLARIFY BECAUSE THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT CRITICS A LOT HAVE NOTED THAT THERE. IS NO WAY FOR OFFICIALS TO KEEP TRACK OF WHO BROUGHT IN THE BALLOTS AND THUS THERE IS NO WAY FOR INVESTIGATORS. I TRACKED DOWN POSSIBLE CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS BY SUCH DESIGNEES AND IF I MAY ASK. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE LA TIMES CRITICISM. TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS EACH DESIGNEES MAY BRING AND. AND REQUIRE SUCH DESIGNEES TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES TO BOTH THE VOTERS. FROM WHOM THEY COLLECT THE VOTE BY MAIL LET'S UP VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS AND THE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO WHOM THEY DELIVER THE BALLOTS. I THINK I SHOULD INCLUDE THE NAME ADDRESS. PHONE NUMBER. AND THE NAME FOR THE CAMPAIGNS FOR WHICH THEY'RE WORKING AND THE TIME AND DATE THAT THE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT IS PICKED UP THOSE ARE THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE BROUGHT BY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES THANK YOU AND AND I BELIEVE VERY AUTHORITY ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING EITHER DO. IT AGAIN I I'D BE HAPPY AYE AYE I KNOW THIS IS SURPRISING I DO NOT TAKE MY DIRECTION FROM THE LA TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD BUT NOW THAT I KNOW YOU DO THERE PROBABLY TWENTY I WILL DELIVER LATER TODAY. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE OPERATING LEGISLATION THAT THE LA TIMES THINKS IS APPROPRIATE UNFORTUNATELY IN ANY OF ANY. ITEM ELECTION. THE COMPLAINTS THAT SOMEBODY WAS AGGRESSIVE WHEN THEY CAME TO MY DOOR IT THEIR BALLOT USUALLY BY THE LOSING CAMPAIGN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. SOMEBODY DIDN'T HAVE A FIELD PROGRAM WAS CONCERNED THAT SOMEBODY CAME TO THE DOOR AND ASK SOMEBODY'S GRANDMOTHER PAID LIKE THEIR BALLOT RETURNED. YOU KNOW WHAT VOTERS CAN SAY NO THEY CAN SHUT THE DOOR IT HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE WHO KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR ALL THE TIME. I M. HAPPY TO LOOK AT A PROBLEM IF IT EXISTS THERE IS ZERO ZERO ALLEGATIONS OF VOTER FRAUD THERE ARE ZERO PEOPLE WHO SAID I VOTED IT MIGHT VOTE DIDN'T GET REGISTERED. THERE ARE ZERO PEOPLE WHO SAID. YOU KNOW THIS CAMPAIGN HELD ONTO A BUNCH OF VOTES ARE EIGHT ZERO. INFERENCE THAT ACTUAL VOTER FRAUD EXISTS IN I KNOW WHILE THE OTHER SIDE MAY LIKE TO LIMIT VOTER CHOICES BY DECLARING THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME. I'M AT. INTENTIONAL VOTER FRAUD SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD HAPPEN IN TELL YOU SHOW ME THAT THERE'S ACTUAL VOTER FRAUD HAPPY WE DO NOT WANT TO PUT ADDITIONAL BARRIERS. TWO PEOPLE VOTING I'M SORRY THE MORE PEOPLE THAT BOTH THE BETTER THE EASIER WE MAKE PEOPLE AND THE OPPORTUNITY VOTE THAT THE THE MORE COST WE TAKE AWAY FROM VOTING THE BETTER IT IS FOR DEMOCRACY AND NOW I WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY AMENDMENTS. MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST TO CLARIFY IN THE MEDIA REPORTS IT WAS NOT THE LOSING CAMPAIGN. OR LOS ANGELES TIMES AND OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS ABOUT THE STRONG ARMING IT WAS VOTERS THAT COMMUNICATED DIRECTLY TO THE POINT WHERE WORKING FOR LIVE LOSING CAMPAIGN THAT'S RIGHT WE CAN BRING OUR NEW ASSEMBLYMEMBER UP AND WE CAN HAVE THIS DISCUSSION MISTER HARPER ON THE FLOOR ON FRIDAY BE HAPPY. TO BRING HER OVER SO WE CAN HAVE A AN AIRING OUT OF GRIEVANCES BUT NO I WON'T ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY ASK THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THE AMENDMENTS DID NOT ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF LOS ANGELES TIMES AS WELL AS THE I WOULD BILL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. WE HAVE A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AT I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN AYE ON THIS VOTE I'M I'M I AM DEEPLY SORRY IF I SUGGESTED WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE MIDWEST OF WAYS TO REDUCE BODY BARRIERS BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY NOT THE CASE BUT. I'M WE ARE ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO ENSURE. THAT BALANCE IS PROPERLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND I RESPECT THE FBI BUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS A VOTER TO DESIGNATE ANY TRUSTED PERSON TO RETURN HIS OR HER VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT IF THE VOTER CANNOT DO SO. WHEN I VOTER INTEREST SOMEONE ELSE WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RETURNING HIS OR HER BALLOT THAT VOTERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT. THE BALLOT TO BE RETURNED TO THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL IN A TIMELY MANNER I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS. TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS BALLOTS ARE NOT UNNECESSARILY VALIDATED IN WITH THAT AMENDMENT I RECOMMEND AS SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. MADAM SECRETARY WILL YOU PLEASE CULTURAL.
