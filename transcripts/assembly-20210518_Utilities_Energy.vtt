ARE. TYPICALLY HOT GAS PATH

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:13.250
UPGRADES. AT- THERMAL PLANTS.

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:14.018
WE'RE ALSO WE'RE WITH THE P.

00:44:14.084 --> 00:44:15.252
CARE. OR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:16.353
RESPONSE. I WAS A GENERAL

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.454
CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN PUNCHING

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:19.023
BELOW OUR WEIGHT OR DEMAND

RESPONSE WITH A LOT OF URGENCY

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:23.193
TO GET THAT- IMPROVED AND SO WE

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.928
CONVENE IT ROUND TABLE. WITH

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:26.630
ALL THE AGENCIES- WITH THE KEY

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:28.532
DEMAND RESPONSE PROVIDERS IN%

OUR CONTINUE TO DISCUSS

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.368
STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE THE

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:32.770
POTENTIAL DEMAND SPONSOR IN THE

00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:34.471
SHORT TERM. AS WELL AS LONG

00:44:34.538 --> 00:44:35.639

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:36.840
ON THAT THAT I THINK YOU'LL

00:44:36.907 --> 00:44:37.674
HEAR MORE ABOUT FROM MY

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:40.310
COLLEAGUE. MISTER ALSO EARLIER%

00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:42.513
THIS YEAR WE RELEASED OUR DRAFT

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:44.148
LOAD MANAGEMENT STANDARDS AIMED

00:44:44.214 --> 00:44:45.949
AT ENABLING MASS MARKET DEMAND

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.885
FLEXIBILITY. THROUGH AUTOMATED

00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:50.354
RESPONSE TO GREAT SIGNALS- AND

00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:52.156
OUR OUR CROWN JEWEL RESEARCH

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.757
PROGRAM THE EPIC PROGRAM

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:58.028
SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

00:44:58.095 --> 00:44:59.830
GRANTS TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:01.832
TO SUPPORT DEMAND FLEXIBILITY I

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:03.967
WOULD SAY GENERALLY. THE MODEL

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:06.103
IS CHANGING FROM YOU KNOW THE

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:07.604
OLD VIEW OF SEEING DEMAND IS

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:11.442
THIS FIXED THING. TO NOW- WHAT.

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:12.576
WE SEE WHAT WE CAN MANIPULATE

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:13.811
THAT DEMAND IT'S REALLY

00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:16.480
IMPORTANT MERGING FIELD- AND SO

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:17.314
WERE ESTIMATED FROM THAT

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:18.949
INVESTMENT THAT TIME OF THE

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:19.716
TWENTY FIVE MEGAWATTS WITH A

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:21.785
FLEXIBLE DEMAND CAPACITY. FROM

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:22.953
COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.788
CUSTOMERS AN EIGHTEEN MEGAWATTS

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:26.223
FROM IRRIGATION PUMPING LOAD.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:30.961
SHIFT. I WILL BE AVAILABLE THIS

00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:31.795
SUMMER. ALL OF THIS IS. TO THE

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.764
WORKER. IN THE DOING. OTHER BUT

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:35.532
RELATED AREAS- BEFORE I TURN

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:36.834
THE MIKE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.036
ALAN MINSTER BECAUSE SO. I DID

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:40.270
WANT TO JUST RECAP AND SOME OF

00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:42.139
THE KEY CLEAN ENERGY MILESTONES

00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:44.141
BECAUSE THIS IS. OF COURSE

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:45.709
CLIMATE IS UNDERLYING A LOT OF

00:45:45.776 --> 00:45:46.977
THE THREATS REFUSING TO BE

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:47.978
GREAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:49.513
HIGHLIGHT. THE PROGRESS WE'RE

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.982
MAKING ON CLEANING UP- DIRECTOR

00:45:52.049 --> 00:45:53.584
GRANT SO LAST YEAR IN

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.653
CALIFORNIA- WE WERE AT 63%

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.522
CARBON FREE ELECTRICITY COURSE

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:02.426
ON ROUTE 2100% BY TWENTY FORTY

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:04.862
FIVE- AND- WE'VE ALSO SEEN. A

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:06.630
LOT OF HELP COMING FROM

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.699
CUSTOMER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:10.534
BEHIND THE METER SO TODAY WE

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.336
NOW HAVE FORTY THOUSAND BEHIND

00:46:12.402 --> 00:46:13.637
THE METER ENERGY STORAGE

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:15.639
SYSTEMS DEPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA.

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.608
ADDING FORTY OF THOSE A DAY.

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:19.643
WE'RE AT ONE POINT TWO MILLION

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:22.146
ROOFTOP SOLAR. ENERGY SYSTEMS

00:46:22.212 --> 00:46:24.515
IN THE STATE TODAY. AND WE'RE

00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:26.450
ADDING FOUR HUNDRED A DAY- AND

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:27.818
THEN ELECTRIC VEHICLES LONG

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:30.187
TERM ARE ALSO REALLY AN ASSET.

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:31.955
TO THE GRID WERE NEARLY NINE

00:46:32.022 --> 00:46:32.556
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOCTORS

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:33.490
VEHICLES THAT HAVE BEEN PART IN

00:46:33.557 --> 00:46:36.093
CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ADDING SIX

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.628
HUNDRED FIFTY A DAY. ON AS YOU

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:39.530
ALL KNOW LAST YEAR AND I LOOK

00:46:39.596 --> 00:46:41.131
AT PEOPLE'S BECAME THE NUMBER

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:41.965
ONE EXPORT FROM THE STATE

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:43.800
CALIFORNIA. I WOULD NOW WANT TO

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:45.302
PASS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.837
LEGISLATURE'S ACTION IN THE

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:47.571
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.706
GET TO. EIGHT MILLION ELECTRIC

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:52.276
VEHICLES. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:53.944
AND THAT TOGETHER REPRESENTS

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:55.779
MORE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND.

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:57.314
MEGAWATT HOURS OF STORAGE AND

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:58.415
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.817
CONSIDERING THAT 96% OF A

JUST WANTED TO ASK A QUICK

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:56.232

I'M CURIOUS IF YOU COULD

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.405
CONTRAST WHAT HAPPENED IN

AUGUST VERSUS WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:54:04.207 --> 00:54:06.810
SEPTEMBER OF LAST. LAST YEAR.

00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:08.345
IN BOTH INSTANCES AN INTENSE

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:10.146
HEAT WAVE BROKE OUT. ACROSS

00:54:10.213 --> 00:54:13.917
CALIFORNIA AND FLEX ALERT. WERE

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:15.719
CALL. YET WE EXPERIENCED

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.921
ROTATING OUTAGES IN AUGUST BUT

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:20.590
AVOIDED THEM IN SEPTEMBER. WHAT

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.926
WAS DIFFERENT IN SEPTEMBER HEY

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:24.127
WE ALREADY APPLIED THE LESSONS

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:27.030
LEARNED IN AUGUST AND HOW MIGHT

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:29.399
THAT INFORMERS AND OUR RESPONSE

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:36.006

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:41.578
CEMEX ARE YES I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:44.180
TAKE INITIAL. ANSWER THAT

00:54:44.247 --> 00:54:45.915
QUESTION I THINK SO I THINK

00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:46.650
THERE WERE THERE WERE A NUMBER

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:48.351
OF LESSONS LEARNED ON THE VERY

00:54:48.418 --> 00:54:50.420
FIRST WEEKEND IN AUGUST

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:51.421
FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH VERY

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:54.658
QUICKLY. I THINK IT THE I SO WE

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:56.559
IDENTIFIED THE SENATE ISSUES

00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:58.428
ASSOCIATED WITH WITH SCHEDULING

00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:00.096
POWER AND OUR ABILITY TO

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.197
DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THE

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:02.532
PHYSICAL SUPPLY DEMAND BALANCE

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:04.668
WISE THAT WE QUICKLY RECTIFIED

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:05.869
SO THAT WAS ADDRESSED TO AYE

00:55:05.935 --> 00:55:07.570
WITHIN EVEN THE FIRST WEEKEND

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:08.872
THE SECOND THING I THINK REALLY

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:10.640
THE BIG DIFFERENCE MAKER. AS

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:12.409
KEY AS TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:14.210
BE VERY VERY HOT ACROSS THE

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:16.312
BOUNCER BOX IN THE WEEKEND WAS

00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:16.780
THAT THERE WAS JUST A

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:19.816
SIGNIFICANT MOBILIZATION OF

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:20.750
COMMUNITY COMMUNICATION

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:22.152
COORDINATION AND ON THE AND

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:23.620
THAT SIGNIFICANT DEMAND

00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:25.221
RESPONSE EFFORT I MEAN THE

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:26.423
EFFORTS THAT INDUSTRY AND

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:28.558
CONSUMERS MADE CALPERS CONSERVE

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:34.330
POWER ACROSS. OR SO I THINK IT

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:35.765
WAS ALL HANDS ON DECK ALL

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.333
AVAILABLE RESOURCES ON BOTH THE

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.435
GENERATION AND THE DEMAND

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:40.036
SOCCER MADE AVAILABLE IN THE

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.905
STATE WAS ABLE TO COME TOGETHER

00:55:41.971 --> 00:55:44.307
AND PREVENT ADDITIONAL ROTATING

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:45.308
OUT IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:46.776
THAT WE TRY TO DO OUT FOR THIS

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.344
UPCOMING SUMMER IS TO SORT OF

00:55:48.411 --> 00:55:50.880
SYSTEM THAT TIES A LOT OF THOSE

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:51.981
EFFORTS THAT WERE DONE ON A BIT

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:54.317
MORE OF AN AD HOC BASIS. LAST

00:55:54.384 --> 00:55:55.652
SUMMER MUCH GREATER COORDINATED

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.620
CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR BOTH

00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:59.189
SUPPLY RESOURCES AND DEMAND

00:55:59.255 --> 00:56:00.757
SIDE RESOURCES AND ANOTHER

00:56:00.824 --> 00:56:01.558
THING THAT'S GOING TO BE I

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:02.859
THINK VERY DIFFERENT THIS

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:03.927
SUMMER THAT WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE

00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:06.029
THE ADVANTAGE OF LAST SUMMER IS

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:07.263
THAT OUR COMMUNICATION IN

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.798
ADVANCE WARNING SYSTEMS ARE

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.467
GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.702
ENHANCE THE I SO WILL BE

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:14.471
PROVIDING SEVEN DAYS OF ADVANCE

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:15.505
WARNING FOR TEMPERATURE

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.207
EXCURSIONS AND HEATING ADVANCED

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:19.242
REGARDING REAL TIME UPDATES. ON

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:20.610
GREAT CONDITIONS GETTING THAT

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:22.912
INFORMATION WIDELY DISSEMINATED

00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:23.980
TO THE UTILITY UTILITY

00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:25.148
COMMUNITY AND THE OPERATING

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.050
COMMUNITY AND THE FLEX ALERT

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:28.752
PROGRAM I THINK IT'S GOING TO

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:31.421
HAVE A SET OF VERY DISTINCT AND

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:33.757
VERY ACTIONABLE MESSAGES THAT

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:35.792
WILL BE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS.

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.260
SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO BE PART

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:39.229
OF THE RELIABILITY EQUATION IF

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:41.264
WE DO INDEED RUN INTO STRESS

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:42.999
GREAT CONDITION SO IT TAKES

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:45.034
BOTH A HEALTHY SUPPLY STAR

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:46.870
WHICH THE CPC ENERGY COMMISSION

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:47.837
OF HEALTH INCREASE FOR THE

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:49.739
SUMMER AND A REALLY STRONG AND

00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:51.541
COORDINATED DEMAND RESPONSE AND

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:53.376
CONTINGENCY ACTION TO MAKE SURE

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:58.281
THAT THIS SUMMER RESULT. IN

00:56:58.348 --> 00:56:58.848
DIFFERENT OUTCOMES THAN LAST

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:00.383
SUMMER. SHAREHOLDERS I'LL ADD

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.319

THINGS THAT LEN ENUMERATED JUST

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.737
NOW I THINK THAT IT WAS

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:23.907
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- THAT WE

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:25.175

IN TERMS OF. RESOURCES THAT WE

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:21.130
TYPICALLY WOULD NOT WANT TO

BELOW. BUT IT'S BEEN A MAJOR

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:51.781
FOCUS FOR US IN TERMS OF OUR

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.182
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:56.052

DEMAND RESPONSE EXPERIMENT FOR

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:16.539
THE SUMMER. I THINK IT'S I

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:17.874
THINK IT'S HELPFUL I THINK I

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.009
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR US TO

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.611
STATE I THINK CRIME I THINK.

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:24.280
FOR BOTH THE CBCP CCMA IN THE

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.481
GOVERNOR SO YOU KNOW IT WITH IN

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:26.849
OUR IN OUR FINAL ROUTE CAUSE

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:29.118
ANALYSIS. WE PUT OUT RESOURCE

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.887
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION ACROSS

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:32.755
THE WIDE SPECTRUM OF RESOURCES

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.457
AND WE IDENTIFIED SOME ISSUES

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:35.158
IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:36.926
PATCHES WITH. THE PERFORMANCE

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.361
OF THE RESOURCES RELATIVE TO

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:40.363
RESOURCE ADEQUACY EXPECTATIONS

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.964
WE DID NOTE. TO CERTAIN AGREES

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.633
THAT IN SOME CASES WE SAW SOME

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:46.536
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:47.136
OF DEMAND RESPONSE RESOURCES.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.238
THAT INSTIGATED A I THINK A

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:51.374
VERY VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.275
WITH THE DEMAND RESPONSE

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:53.276
COMMUNITY WHICH I THINK WE ALL

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.044
LEAD INTO AND LISTEN VERY

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:56.379
CAREFULLY WHERE WE'RE WE LOOK

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:58.081
AT THE DATA. AND WE TRY TO

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:58.881
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.483
INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.385
RESOURCE CAPABILITIES AND THE

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:04.987
ACTUAL RULES FOR THE DEBATERS

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.589
FUNDS PROGRAMS AND SODA COULD

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.324
BE MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT-

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.258
WITHIN THE THREE STE AT

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:11.194
ENTITIES. TO LEAN IN AND TO

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.328
LOOK FOR SOME ADDITIONAL WAYS

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.696
WE MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:15.998
ADJUSTMENTS. TO BETTER ENABLE

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:17.400
THOSE RESOURCES TO MEET THEIR

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.801
PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES THAT I

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:19.936
THINK THIS SMMER WILL BE

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:22.105
PARTICULARLY TRUE. WITH RESPECT

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:23.673
TO THE THIRD PARTY RESOURCES AT

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:24.607
THE AYE SO WE'VE MADE SOME

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.309
CHANGES TO OUR BASE LINING

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.510
METHODOLOGY WHICH SORT OF

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.945
ESTABLISH A DEMONIC IT'S WHICH

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:30.880
THEIR PERFORMANCE IS MEASURED.

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:31.981
THE HOPE IS TO SEE IF THAT

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:32.782
OPENS UP SOME ADDITIONAL

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:35.585
CAPABILITY. THE CPC'S EMERGENCY

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:36.786
LOAD REDUCTION PROGRAM IS

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:38.554
DESIGNED TO REALLY CARRY OUT.

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.189
CAPABILITY WITH STRONG PRICE

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:42.158
SIGNALS- TO ACCESS THAT

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:43.693
CAPABILITY. AND THEN OF COURSE

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:44.961
THE FLEX ROUTE COMPLEX ALERT

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:46.329

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:52.001
IN TERMS OF ITS BEST MESSAGING.

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:54.403
VISIBILITY IN IN THE CLARITY OF

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.338
WHAT WILL BE ASKING AND

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.173
ENCOURAGING OF CONSUMERS SO ALL

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:57.907

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:21.637
WHEN WE'RE GONE TO RENEWABLES

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.038
WHICH'LL PRIDE DOMINANTLY BI

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:27.576
SOLAR- CALIFORNIA WIND ACTUALLY

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.245
GOES TO THE OFFSHORE WIND GOES

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:32.882
DOWN DURING THE WINTER- SO WE

01:07:32.948 --> 01:07:36.051
ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF.

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:37.787
ENERGY GENERATION DURING THE

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.088
WINTER I BROUGHT THIS UP WITH

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.057
THE CLIFF OF COMMISSIONER OF

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:45.194
CPUC COMMISSIONER CLIFF RUSSIA

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:49.999
OFTEN. AND WHAT DO WE DO- FOR

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:53.302
THE WINTER- MONTHS AS WE

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:56.972
APPROACH A HUNDRED PERCENT-

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:59.241
PEOPLE HAVE VARIOUS IDEAS YOU

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:01.243
CAN'T DO IT WITH BATTERIES THEY

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:03.078
WON'T HOLD A CHARGE LONG ENOUGH

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:04.814
AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LITHIUM

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.883
AND COBALT ANYWAY. BOB YOU

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:10.085
CAN'T DO IT WITH- PUMPED

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:12.788
STORAGE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:16.025
ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH. SO PEOPLE

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.427
TALK ABOUT CREATING HYDROGEN

01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:20.729
FROM SOLAR AND STORING IT.

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:23.165
WHATEVER WE DO WHEN YOU STORE

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:24.633
SOMETHING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.068
TIME IT'S LIKE PUTTING MONEY IN

01:08:26.135 --> 01:08:29.038
THE GROUND- IT'S GONNA BE VERY

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:33.209
EXPENSIVE. THAT MUCH- PROJECT-

01:08:33.275 --> 01:08:35.177
BUT- YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEING DONE

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:39.548
NOW TO LOOK AHEAD. TO THAT

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:41.650
ISSUE OF RELIABILITY FOR THE

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:44.453
WINTER MONTHS AS WE GET CLOSER

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.724
21100% RENEWABLES. HIS QUICK I

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:52.461
CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT A BIT- SO.

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:54.363
FOR ONE THING- WHAT ONE OF THE

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.499
ENERGY COMMISSION HAS AT THIS

01:08:56.565 --> 01:08:58.434
POINT FUNDED ABOUT SIXTY ENERGY

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:00.202
STORAGE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:01.871
ACROSS THE STATE. WITH

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:03.506
VIRTUALLY EVERY CHEMISTRY

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.773
MENTIONED LITHIUM ION WHICH IS

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.975
THE PREDOMINANT FORMA STORES

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:08.410
TODAY AND CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.179
THE LEADER IN THE SPACE BUT

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:10.946
THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:12.448
CHEMISTRIES VANADIUM IRON

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:15.084
CHROMIUM AND OTHERS WE JUST

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:17.920
FIND IT COMICAL FORM ENERGY.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.356
WHICH HAS A VERY VERY VERY LOW

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:23.025
COST BUT VERY INEFFICIENT

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:24.593
ROUNDTRIP EFFICIENCY SO LOOK AT

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.930
MY OWN IS ABOUT 90% ROUGHLY

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.899
ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY THIS

01:09:29.965 --> 01:09:32.034
CHEMISTRIES ABOUT 50% CONTRA

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:33.969
PROFICIENCY BUT IT'S SUPER

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:36.639
CHEAP- AND THERE IS A CHANCE

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:39.308
WHAT WE HAVE SURPLUS RENEWABLES

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:39.875
AND SURPLUS SOLAR DURING THE

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.844
DAY. ARE TO ACTUALLY CHARGE

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.546
WHEN YOU HAVE EXTRA ENERGY AND

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.281
USE IT FOR A SEASONAL STORAGE

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:47.216
SO THAT IS A AN EMERGING FIELD

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.884
THAT I DO SEE GROWING- IN

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:49.852
ADDITION TO THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:52.154
DON'T WANT ALL OF THE POWER TO

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:54.456
BE SOLD FOR EXAMPLE WE WANT TO

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:55.624
DIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGIES

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:56.759
INCLUDING WIND INCLUDING

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:57.960
OFFSHORE WIND WOULD FOR PUTTING

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.428
A LOT OF WORK INTO RIGHT NOW.

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.397
INCLUDING GEOTHERMAL AND OTHERS

01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:04.567
AND SO DIVERSITY OF RENEWABLE

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:05.434
GENERATION IS AN ESSENTIAL PART

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.136
OF THE STRATEGY AUGMENTED

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:08.404
BEEFING UP STORAGE GENERALLY IN

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.739
THE GOVERNOR'S- BUDGET- IN

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:12.575
REVISE IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:14.076
MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE ENERGY

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:15.611
COMMISSION TO JUST DO LONG

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:16.445
DURATION STORAGE SO THIS IS

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:22.384
GOING TO BE A MAJOR. FOCUS FOR

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:23.586
US- IN THE YEARS AHEAD. I'LL

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.988
JUST ADD TO IF I MAY UM.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.591
SENATOR THAT AT THE SEAT U. C.

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:31.894
WE I AGREE SO. WITH THE SAN-

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:34.363
IDEAS. THE CHAIR JUST PUT

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.465
FORWARD AND THAT IS A DIVERSITY

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:37.833
OF OUR PORTFOLIO OR THE

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.335
PORTFOLIO IS SO EXTREMELY

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:42.104
IMPORTANT. AND WE HAVE THE

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:44.106
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:47.643
PROCESS THAT DOES DICTATE

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:51.814
INDEED- A THREE YEAR FORWARD

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.251
LOOKING- PROCESS THAT THEN

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:58.220
LEADS TO- BORDERS OF A

01:10:58.287 --> 01:10:59.421
PROCUREMENT THAT WE AT THE

01:10:59.488 --> 01:11:03.559
CPUC- PUT FORWARD SO- THE

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:05.461
DIVERSITY OF THE PORTFOLIO IS

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.463
REALLY CRITICAL AS AT THE

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.498
CHAIRMAN SAID WE DON'T JUST

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:11.433
WANT TO SURVIVE ON SOLAR AND

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.069
SOLAR. BACKED UP BATTERY AS

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:17.006
WELL BUT- WE'RE ENCOURAGING IN

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:19.808
OUR I. R. P. PROCESS AND

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:20.943
DECISION WHICH WILL BE

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.711
FORTHCOMING IN THE NEXT MONTH

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:26.682
THE CURRENT ONE THAT WILL COVER

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:27.683
TWENTY TWENTY THREE THROUGH

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:28.283
TWENTY TWENTY SIX. A DIVERSE

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.886
PORTFOLIO SO I'M GONNA TURN TO

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:33.389
MY COLLEAGUE EDWARD RANDOLPH TO

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:34.523
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.791
THAT I MISSED THAT YOU LIKE TO

HER- THANK YOU PRESENT A

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.032
BACHELOR AND I THINK YOU'RE

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:43.632
YOU'RE REALLY COVER IT I'LL

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:45.768
JUST ADD. ON IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:48.137
MODELING FOR THAT ARE DONE WITH

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:50.139
AN I. R. P. COMPARE THAT WITH

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:52.174
MODELING HAVE BEEN DONE- WITH

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:54.476
THE SB ONE HUNDRED REPORT-

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:56.545
MODELING THAT'S BEING DONE AT A

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:59.948
RP IN RELATION TO- SCOPING

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:01.417
PLANS BUT THEN ALSO VERY

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:02.651
IMPORTANTLY MODELING HAVE BEEN

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:05.754
DONE BY- VARIOUS ACADEMIC

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.790
ORGANIZATIONS. OTHER GROUPS

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:09.124
THAT ARE OUT THERE THEY'RE

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:12.261
CONSISTENTLY SHOWING- THE ROAD

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:13.328
MAP TO GET TO THAT NINETY

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:18.834
PERCENT- CARBON FREE- IS COST

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:20.969
OF. COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO GET

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.871
THERE AS LONG AS WE PURSUE A

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:23.806
DIVERSE PORTFOLIO THAT

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:26.008
INCLUDES- A VARIETY OF

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:27.876
DIFFERENT RESOURCES THAT CAN

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:28.911
OPERATE IN DIFFERENT TIMES OF

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:31.680
DAY- GETTING TO THAT NEXT TEN

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:33.782
PERCENT- MAY BE MORE OF A

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:36.051
CHALLENGE BUT- YOU KNOW I

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:36.652
PERSONALLY THINK LET'S GET TO

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.987
THE NINETY PERCENT- AND THEN

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:40.556
KEEP PUSHING THROUGH THERE. BUT

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:42.758
THERE ARE NOW ALSO A NUMBER OF

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.059
DIFFERENT MODELING EFFORTS IT

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:46.195
CHAU- THE RESOURCE DIVERSITY

01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:47.596
MIXES WE CAN FOLLOW TO GET TO

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:49.865
THAT- 100% THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:52.768
AND YES R. I. R. P. PRECEDING

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.603
WILL HAVE SOME DECISIONS COMING

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.739
OUT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS-

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:57.973
THERE'S BEEN SOME JUDGES

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.575
RULINGS OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:02.578
INDICATING NEED FOR- SOME BILLS

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:05.047
OUT VERY SOON OF GEO THERMAL-

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:08.117
OF THAT LONG DURATION STORAGE-

01:13:08.183 --> 01:13:09.618
THAT STORAGE CAN HELP BOTH

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:12.087
COVER YOU- FOR MULTIPLE HOURS

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:13.455
BETWEEN THE DAY AND THE NIGHT

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.791
BUT THEN ALSO- THE SEASONAL

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:18.260
STORAGE OUT THERE- AND- YOU

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:19.561
KNOW WE'LL HAVE A DECISION OUT

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:21.029
THERE THE BILL'S ON. ON THE

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:21.930
JUDGE'S COMMENTS PLUS COMMENTS

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:27.136
WE'VE HEARD- FROM STAKEHOLDERS

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:29.204
IN THAT PROCEEDING. I THANK YOU.

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:29.905
FOR I HAVE A COUPLE MORE

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:31.073
QUESTIONS BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.841
TO SOMEONE ELSE FIRST IF I

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:35.043
COULD YEAH BUT WE WILL COME

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:37.479
BACK TO YOU APPRECIATE THAT- SO

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:40.249
MEMBER OF ARCADIA. THANK YOU

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:41.717
MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:43.352
THE THREE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:44.553
AND TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.687
WITH US IT'S OBVIOUSLY AS

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:46.989
PRESIDENT BETTER POINTS OUT

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:49.057
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THAT WE

01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:50.359
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:52.828
THAT. THE POWER STAYS ON FOR

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:54.096
CALIFORNIANS SO IT'S AN

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:55.164
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:56.431
APPRECIATE YOUR DEDICATION AND

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.333
CLEARLY THEY DIDN'T DEDICATION.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.568
THAT IS EVIDENT IN THE WORK

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:02.037
YOU'VE DONE TO DATE TO ENSURE

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:02.604
THAT WE'RE IN A BETTER PLACE

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:04.439
THIS SUMMER. REALLY GRATEFUL TO

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:05.908
HEAR US TALKING ABOUT INCREASED

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.743
ENERGY STORAGE I THINK IT'S SO

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.278
CRITICAL TO OUR RENEWABLE

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:10.612
PORTFOLIO AND I THINK THAT

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.347
THAT. IT OFTEN I HEAR PEOPLE

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:13.682
SAY OH THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:15.751
CONTINUE. TO INCREASE NATURAL

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:17.219
GAS AND I THINK THAT WHAT YOU

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.287
ARE SAYING IS REALLY THE HEART

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:19.354
OF WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:20.856
WHICH IS STORE CLEAN ENERGY TO

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:22.658
ENSURE IT'S AVAILABLE DURING

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:25.761
THAT PEAK DEMAND. AND SO I'VE

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:26.995
HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT I'VE

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:27.729
HEARD A LOT ABOUT DEMAND

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:30.132
RESPONSE I WANT TO TOUCH ON AND

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:32.568
THE THIRD ROUTE BECAUSE THE YOU

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:35.204
ALL IDENTIFIED- WHICH WAS THAT

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.805
SOME PRACTICES IN THE DAY AHEAD

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:38.273
ENERGY MARKET EXACERBATED THE

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.842
SUPPLY CHALLENGES UNDER HIGHLY

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:42.044
STRESSED CONDITIONS AS I READ

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.012
THAT THAT'S A FANCY WAY OF

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:44.980
SAYING THAT WE WERE EXPORTING

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:47.382
ENERGY ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH WHEN

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:49.785
WE NEEDED IT SO BADLY- RATHER

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:51.720
THAN USING THE ENERGY BEING

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:54.890
CREATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.158
I KNOW YOU THEN SUSPENDED

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.392
CONVERGENCE BIDDING WHICH WE

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.595
SAW ON THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.763
THAT THAT ALLOWED US TO EXPORT

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.465
LESS ENERGY BUT ON AUGUST

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.067
FIFTEENTH THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:07.636
EXPORTING ENERGY AND THAT IS A

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:08.937
MAJOR REASON WHY WE DIDN'T HAVE

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:10.873
ENOUGH ENERGY TO MEET HELP TO

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:11.607
ME CALIFORNIA'S DEMANDS THAT

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:14.042
DAY. AND I JUST WANT TO EXPAND

01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:15.477
ON WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ADDRESS

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:16.678
THAT I KNOW YOU PUT THAT

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:18.313
CONVERGENCE MEETINGS BACK THAT

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.281
SEEM TO BE WHAT ADDRESSED IN

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.250
THE SHORT TERM BUT IT APPEARS

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:22.384
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO OTHER

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:23.285
THINGS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:24.519
NOT IN THE POSITION TO BE

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:28.123
EXPORTING ENERGY AGAIN WHEN WE

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.191
HAVE HEAT EVENTS THIS SUMMER.

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.459
YES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE

01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:31.727
QUESTION AND I'LL- TRY TO

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:32.895
ADDRESS IT IS DIRECTLY AS

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.329
POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S AN ISSUE

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:35.831
THAT HAS BEEN RAISED. NUMEROUS

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:38.433
TIMES. I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.203
IMPORTANT. THAT WE- JUST WHERE

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:42.905
IS TRANSPARENT AND AS CLEAR AS

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:44.339
WE POSSIBLY COULD ABOUT ABOUT

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.275
THIS ISSUE. AND IT IS

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:48.043
ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT ON A DAY

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:50.412
AHEAD BASIS. ARE GOING INTO THE

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:51.747
AUGUST FOURTEENTH FIFTEENTH

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:55.217
TIME FRAME. OF THE ISO DID.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:56.885
INDICATE THAT HE COULD SUPPORT

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:59.488
GREATER EXPORTS I IN A DAY

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:01.456
AHEAD MARKET. MIND YOU WE WERE

01:16:01.523 --> 01:16:02.824
STILL ANTICIPATING BEING A

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.661
SIGNIFICANT NET IMPORTER BUT AT

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:06.962
DURING THAT DURING THAT TIME

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:08.130
FRAME BUT IT LOOKED AS THOUGH

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:08.964
BECAUSE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:10.132
ENTITIES THAT WERE ATTEMPTING

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:11.733
TO BUY OUT OF OUR MARKET. AS IS

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.136
COMMON. IN THE COMBINATION WITH

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:15.804
THE CONVERGENCE BETTING THAT WE

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:17.105
THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:18.373
SUPPORT MORE EXPORTS ONCE WE

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.742
SAW THAT. WE WERE ABLE TO

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.878
EFFECTIVELY PURCHASE BACK THE

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:25.547
VAST MAJORITY OF THAT ENERGY IN

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:27.616
THE SUBSEQUENT DAY HOURLY AND

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:30.218
REAL TIME MARKET SO WE'VE MADE

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.720
THAT DIFFERENCE OUT BETWEEN DAY

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:33.121
AHEAD AND ARE REALLY REAL TIME

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:34.690
SUCH THAT BY THE TIME WE

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.058
ACTUALLY GOT INTO THE HOURS

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:37.693
DISPATCH. ON THE FOURTEENTH

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:40.462
FIFTEENTH WE WORDS. IMPORTING I

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:41.997
THINK APPROXIMATELY SIX

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:42.831
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ENERGY WE

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.833
WERE STILL BY FAR AND AWAY THE

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.902
NET IMPORTER IN THE MOST OF

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:47.402
THAT IMBALANCE HAD BEEN

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:50.405
RECTIFIED. THAT SAID WE CLEARLY

01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:51.640
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT GOING

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:53.742
FORWARD WE ADDRESS THE ISSUES

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:55.010
ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESIDUAL

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:57.479
UNIT COMMITMENT PROCESS MADE

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:58.246
SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING THE

01:16:58.313 --> 01:16:59.815
MOST ACCURATE SCHEDULING

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:01.850
BEHAVIOR WE POSSIBLY COULD. AND

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:03.018
MADE SURE THAT IF WE THAT IF

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:05.220
THERE ARE ANY OTHER ELEMENTS OF

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:06.321
THE MERGING OF OUR PHYSICAL AND

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:07.723
FINANCIAL MARKET MECHANISMS

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:10.325
THAT WE HAD CLARIFIED AS WE ARE

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:10.859
ABLE TO CLEAR THEM UP VERY

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:13.228
QUICKLY. IN ADDITION TO SINCE

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.797
LAST AUGUST- WE'VE GOT A LOT OF

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:20.268
WORK. I WISH WITH. EIGHT AND

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.269
BECAUSE ACROSS. THE TO ME SURE

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:23.472
THAT THE SCHEDULING PRIORITIES

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.340
FOR LOAD SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:27.342
FOR EXPORTS OUT OF OUR MARKET.

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.744
ENTRY OTHER ENTITIES WHO WIELD

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.245
POWER ACROSS OUR SYSTEM ARE

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.247
CLARIFIED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:33.615
POSSIBLE SO WE WERE VERY

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:34.816
TRANSPARENT I THINK IT IS

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:36.985
IMPORTANT TO MENTION- THAT THAT

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:39.121
WAS A- FACTOR THE CONSTRUCTING

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.288
TRIBUTE TO THE STRESS THE-

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:42.057
PRECONDITIONS. YOU KNOW WE HAD

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.592
THOSE MARKET MECHANISMS IN

01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:45.761
PLACE FOR MANY MANY YEARS WORK

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:47.396
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND THEY

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:48.930
WERE CERTAINLY NOT A PROBLEM

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:51.033
UNTIL WE GOT TO THE OUTER EDGE

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:52.968
OF OUR RESERVE MARGIN AND SO

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.636
THE OTHER VARIABLES COMPETITION

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:55.670
REALLY CREATE THE PROBLEM SO IT

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:58.006
CERTAINLY BY ITSELF. I WAS NOT

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:59.508
GOING TO GET WAS NOT GONNA

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:00.242
SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM WE SAW

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:02.544
EVEN GREATER. LOAD FORECASTS IN

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:04.079
SUBSEQUENT DAYS IF IT WASN'T

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:06.448
FOR THE MOBILIZATION- THAT YOUR

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:07.716
WHOLE SHIELD AND PRESIDENT

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.384
PATRICK TALKED ABOUT EARLIER.

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:10.685
WE WOULD HAVE HAD ADDITIONAL

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:12.187
ROTATING OUTAGES EVEN WITH

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.122
THOSE FIXES TO THE MARKET SO I

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:15.157
THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:16.525
OWN IT AND THAT THEIR ISSUES

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:18.693
BUT IT WAS FIVE. CERTAINLY NOT-

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.128
THE LONE VARIABLE- THAT

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:21.196
CONTRIBUTED THE OUTAGES AND ALL

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:22.564
THE OTHER CHANGES THAT WE'RE

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:24.232
MAKING. IN INCOME IN

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:25.534
COORDINATION WITH THE STATE

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.335
AGENCIES ARE ESSENTIAL. FOR

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:28.770
RELIABILITY GOING TOWARDS UP

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:33.942
THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. I AND

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:34.509
I HOPE THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO.

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:37.212
THANK YOU AB ALSO TO ADDRESS.

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:39.848
AND THE I'M SURE ALL OF YOU

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:41.149
SIDE BUT THERE WAS A MARCH

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.785
THIRTY FIRST ARTICLE BIG KQED

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:44.486
CAME OUT WITH THIS GUY SAYING

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.122
THAT- SHUT DOWN RATHER THAN

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:48.957
TURN UP OF THE PENDERS FACILITY

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:51.960
BY A PG&amp;E 8EDULING.

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:52.961
COORDINATOR I GUESS THE

01:18:53.028 --> 01:18:54.162
QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THAT

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:56.198
ARTICLE ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAS

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:58.834
AS- INDICATED ACCIDENTAL

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.836
WHETHER THEIR INCENTIVES IN

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:02.838
PLACE TO INCENTIVIZE AND I OWE

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.706
YOU THAT ALSO CONTROLS ACCESS

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:07.876
TO ENERGY DURING. A SHORTAGE.

01:19:07.943 --> 01:19:09.511
AS WE SEE POWER THE COST OF

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.813
ENERGY GOING UP. SURE AS IT IS

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.248
IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER THAT WAS

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:15.450
INTENTIONAL OR NOT OR WHETHER

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:16.818
THERE IS INCENTIVE OR NOT TO DO

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:18.487
THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:21.456
SAW. YOU GUYS SO PUT OUT A

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:22.724
REQUEST TO P. GINNY THE

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:23.291
SCHEDULING COORDINATOR THEN

01:19:23.358 --> 01:19:25.460
REACTED THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:27.929
YOU HAD INSTRUCTED AND I'M

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:29.598
SEVEN BORN STEEN AS HE

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.666
MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE SAID

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:32.467
YOU KNOW ARE WE DOING

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:33.935
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.070
THAT OUR COMMUNICATIONS ARE

01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:36.438
CLEAR IN THE WITH THE ISO IS

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.340
AFTER CALLOUS OF ASKING FOR IS

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:39.374
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THESE

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:41.376
EVENTS. SO THEY WERE NOT EVEN

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:42.711
THOUGH WHETHER THAT WAS THE

01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:43.745
FINAL TIPPING POINT AS

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:45.814
INDICATED OR JUST ONE OF SOUND

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.816
LIKE A LOT OF FACTORS WE NEED

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:48.884
TO BE GETTING IT EVERY SINGLE

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:49.918
ONE OF THEM ENSURING CLEAR

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:51.686
COMMUNICATION OF OUR ENERGY

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:52.721
GREAT THINGS LIKE AN IMPORTANT

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:53.955
FACTOR SO I WANT TO KNOW HOW

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:55.457
THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED YEAH

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.192
VERY MUCH SO NO GOOD AT THE TWO

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:58.793
THOUSAND. YOUR QUESTION AND YOU

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.962
KNOW AGAIN- THIS IS ANOTHER

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:02.197
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:04.566
IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW IN IN OUR

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.835
EVALUATION OF ALL THE EVENTS OF

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.036
AUGUST FOURTEENTH THE FIFTEENTH

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.771
WE WENT BACK AND WE LOOKED VERY

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:11.273
CAREFULLY AT THE DATA. WE

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:12.774
LOOKED WE LISTENED TO ALL THE

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:13.775
COURT REVIEWED ALL THE

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.110
CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:17.846
OURSELVES AND PG&amp;E AND

01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:19.481
UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW I'M SURE

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:20.215
THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:21.683
HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT DISPATCH

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:23.718
ORDERS DELIVERED DURING THOSE

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:25.187
PERIODS THIS WAS ONE WHERE THIS

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:26.388
THERE WAS A COMMUNICATION MIX

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:28.890
UP- WITH THE PLANT OPERATOR. IN

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:30.892
THE UTILITY AND I KNOW TO THEIR

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.627
CREDIT P. JEANNIE ACTUALLY

01:20:32.694 --> 01:20:35.096
SPOKE PUBLICLY AND OPENLY IN

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:40.969
IN- IN THIS. LAST YEAR AND- WE

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:41.903
CERTAINLY DO NOT SEE AN AND SO.

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:42.604
FOR THEM WHAT'S TO BE.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.706
GENERATION IN EVEN MORE PRO

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:45.707
NINETY. CLEAN PORTLY. THE

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:46.808
DEPARTMENT OF MARKET MONITORING

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:49.511
OUR INDEPENDENT MARKET MONITOR.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.513
I HAD ACCESS TO JUST. REBEL

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.781
AMOUNTS OF DATA WENT BACK AND

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:53.949
REVIEWED EVERYTHING AND FOUND

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:56.618
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE OF

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:57.886
WITHHOLD STRATEGIC WITHHOLDING

01:20:57.953 --> 01:20:59.554
OR MARKET MANIPULATION DURING

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:00.822
THIS PERIOD SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:02.224
THAT'S- IMPORTANT ALL OF US IN

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:04.025
CALIFORNIA THE INTEGRITY OF OUR

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.627
ENERGY MARKETS IS EXTREMELY

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:06.161
IMPORTANT IN YOUR SECTOR

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:07.829
EVENING. VERY VIGILANT AND

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.631
DILIGENT BUT CERTAINLY IT WAS

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.832
AN UNFORTUNATE COMMUNICATION

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:12.567
EXCEPT. I WAS CERTAINLY BY FAR

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.236
AND AWAY NOT THIS WEEK THE

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:15.570
SWING ISSUE THAT THAT WITH THE

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:17.239
CITY BUT THE STATE AND THE

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:18.773
DISTRUSTING DITIONS THE HEAT.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.842
AND THE LOADS AND ALL THE OTHER

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:21.443
VARIABLES ARE MUCH MUCH MUCH

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:23.745
BIGGER. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS-

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:24.980
AND I THINK THAT THAT ISSUE HAS

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.448
BEEN RECTIFIED. AND GOING

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:27.582
FORWARD WE CERTAINLY WILL MAKE

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:28.717
SURE THAT THAT ALL

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:29.784
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OURSELVES

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.286
AND CERTAINLY THE UTILITIES IN

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:32.153
THERE TOO AND THEY'RE GONNA

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.521
CHARGE BECAUSE CLEAR AND

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:34.656
CONCISE AS POSSIBLE CAN YOU SAY

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:39.828
HOW. IT'S BEEN RECTIFIED. YEAH

01:21:39.894 --> 01:21:41.763
I MEAN. JEFF WELL FIRST OF ALL-

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.565

WITH LEADERS FROM EIGHTEEN

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:50.739
UTILITIES AND ASSET OWNERS

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:52.540
AROUND THE WEST REVIEWING ALL

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:53.141
OF THE ISSUES THAT HAPPENED

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:55.543
LAST YEAR. OUR SYSTEM OPERATORS

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:57.379
HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING TABLE TOP

AND ALL OF THE ADJACENT SYSTEM

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:02.917
OPERATORS TO GO RIGHT THROUGH.

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.452
THE SET OF OPERATING SCENARIOS

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:05.487
IN THE COMMUNICATIONS

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.389

BETWEEN THE SYSTEM OPERATORS

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:10.725
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:12.227
AREN'T ANY OTHER POTENTIAL

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:13.695
MISTAKES THAT WERE. THAT YOU

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.063
KNOW THAT THAT'S OUR PARTICULAR

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:17.198
SITUATION WAS. ABSOLUTELY THE

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.500
EXCEPTION TO THE RULE I THINK

BETWEEN OURSELVES AND UTILITIES

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.472
AND UTILITIES THEY'RE- IN THE

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:25.707
SCHEDULING COORDINATORS ARE

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.876
ASSETS WORKS JUST FINE. IT'S

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:28.810
UNFORTUNATE WE HAD THAT ONE

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.278
INCIDENT- AND I BELIEVE IT'S

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:34.616
BEEN RECTIFIED AND WE'LL. WE'LL

PRESIDENT ROGER. AND WE'VE

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.956
MENTIONED A LOT THE VALUE OF

01:22:42.023 --> 01:22:43.091
ROOFTOP SOLAR IN BEHIND THE

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:46.628
METER RESOURCES ADAM I THINK-

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.063
YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:48.863

THEY'RE WORKING ON IS NOT ONLY

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:56.204
MAKING SURE THAT THOSE BEHIND

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:57.038
THE METER RESOURCES ARE

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:58.573
AVAILABLE FOR DEMAND RESPONSE

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.974
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL.

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:01.376
BUT ALSO SO WE CAN DEPLOY THAT

01:23:01.443 --> 01:23:02.844
ENERGY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:03.745
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE HAD

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.847
ENOUGH ENERGY BEHIND THE METER.

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.515
TO AVOID THESE- ROLLING BACK

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:08.483
OUT SO I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE

PROGRAM- SOME BEHIND THE METER

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:47.389
STORAGE SYSTEMS ARE SIZED TO

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:49.624
HAVE EXCESS ENERGY THAT COULD

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.459
BE EXPORTED TO THE GRID.

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:53.194
HOWEVER WHEN THEY- WERE

01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.629
INTERCONNECTED TO THE ELECTRIC

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.030
SYSTEM THE CUSTOMERS DID NOT

RESOURCES- TO THE ICE SO TO THE

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:03.498
AYE- TO THE GRIT- IN THE EVENT

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:06.434
A OF WORK IS CALLED. ONE OF

LEVEL REDUCTION PROGRAM THAT WE

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:14.609
HOPE THEY DO PARTICIPATE AND-

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:17.078
IT IS- WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AND

01:25:17.145 --> 01:25:19.314
REFERRED TO AS NET EXPORT OF

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:19.881
BEHIND THE METER STORAGE AND

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:22.183
ALLOWING- BEHIND THE METER

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:23.818
STORAGE THAT IS INTERCONNECTED

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:24.819
TO THE GREAT IN A WAY WHERE

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:26.221
THEY ARE ALLOWED TO ALREADY NET

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:29.991
EXPORT- TWO BILLION TO THE- ERP

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:32.393
AND PARTICIPATE THERE- THAT SET

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.828
UP AS A PILOT PROJECT SO THAT

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:35.697
WE CA- GET GREATER

01:25:35.763 --> 01:25:38.233
UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT THE

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.234
CAPABILITIES OF THOSE RESOURCES

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.136
ARE ON IN BETTER DESIGNING

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:44.672
MARKET RULES- MORE OTHER RULES

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:46.274
AROUND THOSE PROGRAMS IN FUTURE

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:47.408
YEARS SO THAT WE MAKE SURE

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:48.476
THEY'RE GETTING COMPENSATED FOR

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:50.879
THE VALUE TO PROVIDING- BUT AT

01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:57.085
THE SAME TIME- THEY'RE.

01:25:57.151 --> 01:25:57.652
PROVIDING THE VALUE THEY'RE

01:25:57.719 --> 01:25:58.286
GETTING COMPENSATED FOR. THANK

01:25:58.353 --> 01:25:58.953
YOU I FOR THAT I. THE WORK THAT

01:25:59.020 --> 01:25:59.854
DOING HOPEFULLY CAN MOVE THAT

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:00.889
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THIS

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:01.689
IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:05.093
CALIFORNIA. DURING THE

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:08.029
INTERESTS YOU HAVE A QUESTION.

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:10.532
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I DO

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:11.533
WANT TO APPRECIATE ALL THE

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:12.467
COMMENTS WERE MADE EARLIER

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:15.570
ABOUT THE SUMMER OUTAGES-

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:17.539
DURING THIS HEAT WAVE MOST

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:19.374
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE ASKING

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.341
PEOPLE DURING THE PANDEMIC TO

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:22.277
STAY HOME SO THIS IS SOMETHING

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:24.913
THAT WE WERE EXPECTING TO

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:25.513
HAPPEN THAT THERE WOULD BE A

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:29.450
GREATER. DEMAND AT THAT TIME.

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:31.519
IT ALSO IS A STARK REMINDER OF

01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:34.489
HOW MUCH WE RELY ON THE GRID IN

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:37.191
OUR THAT DAILY LIVES. I THINK

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:39.260
THAT GIVEN OUR AMBITIOUS

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:40.495
CLIMATE GOALS WE'VE BEEN

01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:42.130
TALKING ABOUT THE USE THE

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:43.898
GOVERNOR'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:44.499
THESE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THEM

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:47.669
HERE. AND ALSO CONSIDERING OUR

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:49.804
EXISTING NEEDED TO MAKE THE

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.940
GRID MORE RELIABLE IT SEEMS

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:54.776
THAT WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:57.045
LEVERAGE EXISTING RESOURCES. TO

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:59.080
OFFSET DEMAND AND ENSURE THAT

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:00.882
WE HAVE THE CLEANEST OPTIONS

01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:04.085
AVAILABLE. HI MIKE MY QUESTION

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:10.158
TO- PRESIDENT DOWNTURN. AGAIN

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:12.060
THE BRITS RELIABILITY IS

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:14.562
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE DO

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:16.664
HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THESE

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.099
EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. BUT

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.901
MORE IMPORTANTLY TO ME IS THAT

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.603
WE'RE LOOKING TO ELECTRIFY OUR

01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:23.905
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR ON TOP OF

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:27.575
EVERYTHING ELSE. AND SO THE

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:29.210
AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT'S GOING

01:27:29.277 --> 01:27:32.847
TO BE NEEDED SPECIFICALLY AS WE

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:33.448
TRY TO MEET OUR TRANSPORTATION

01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:37.552
GOALS. IT THIS IS ENORMOUS SO

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:40.521
THE QUESTION IS HOW IS THE

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:43.024
ELECTRIFICATION PROCESS BEING

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:44.926
CONSIDERED IN REGARDS TO THE-

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:47.528
OVERALL DEMAND. AND THE

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:49.397
RELIABILITY OF THE GRID AND

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:52.433
WHAT STEPS IS THE CPUC TAKING.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:57.438
TO ADDRESS THIS. THANK YOU VERY

01:27:57.505 --> 01:27:59.674
MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION NEVER ON

CONTRIBUTION AND THE ENERGY

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:28.609
CONTRIBUTION. FROM ELECTRIC

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:30.444
VEHICLES TODAY I WANT TO BE IN

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:32.346
ANTICIPATING IN TWENTY THIRTY

01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:33.781
AND WORK WITH ANTICIPATING IN

TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND WHAT ARE

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:36.550
THE THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO DO

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:38.853
ON. ENSURING WE COULD USE SOME

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.423
OF THOSE AS STORAGE ON THE- OF

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:43.557
THE OTHER TECHNICAL SUPPORT

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:45.059
FROM A CHARGING PERSPECTIVE BUT

pWELL AS- THE PEAK DEMAND

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.139
PERSPECTIVE. THAT LESS THAN ONE

01:32:58.205 --> 01:33:00.441
PERCENT. OUR CURRENT MODELING I

01:33:00.508 --> 01:33:02.376
SUGGEST THAT AT THE END OF

01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:04.278
TECHNICALS WILL CONTRIBUTE. A

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:06.614

OF 4% CLOSE 25% IN TWENTY.

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:15.656
THIRTY EST ANIMAL CONSUMPTION

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:19.160
GOALS. IN TWENTY FIFTY OR

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.227
TWENTY FORTY FIVE TIME FRAME

WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT NUMBER

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:23.397
EXPANDING TO ALMOST 20% OF

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:25.032
ELECTRIC ENERGY USAGE IN THE

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.268
STATE. SO A FEW THINGS WERE

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:28.569
TRYING TO DO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:30.838

THE TWENTY TWENTY I FOR. THE

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:41.816
QUESTION THAT THE LAND A FEW

01:33:41.882 --> 01:33:43.351
SCENARIOS TO UNDERSTAND HOW

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:44.986
BEST TO CHARGE TO ENSURE

01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:48.055
GREATER. WE MODEL SOME OF THOSE

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:49.857
AT THIS LAST YEAR AND WILL

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:52.093
CONTINUE TO MODEL THEM- TO

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:52.994
PROVIDE MORE SITUATIONAL

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:55.663
BUSINESS. ON THIS TOPIC YOU

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:56.864

AVAIL. AND DRD SOURCE ON THE-

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:20.554
AND YOU THINK TO WHAT THAT'S ME

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:21.722
FROM A BULK AT TO A

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:23.257
DISTRIBUTION. A GOOD PLANNING

LEVEL CALL. OKAY AND YOUR

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:36.170
QUESTION. I COULD A GOOD TO

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:36.804
HAVE THE X. GIVING ANSWERS WE

01:34:36.871 --> 01:34:38.005
JUST GET ASK ANSWER ASK THE

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:38.906

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:41.609
QUESTION FOR OWN. CHAIR CHILD.

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:44.178
AND WANT TO GO BACK TO THE IN

01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:46.013
THE FINDINGS ON THE ROOT CAUSE

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.649
ANALYSIS. IT'S SUGGESTED AND

01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:50.751
I'LL QUOTE THE ENERGY ENTITIES

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:52.053
SHOULD PRIORITIZE AND

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:55.256
ARTICULATE A CONTINGENCY PLAN.

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:56.223
IN THE EVENT FURTHER

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.526
ANTICIPATED EVENTS OCCUR SO

01:34:58.592 --> 01:35:00.461
THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.630
THAT OCCURRED IN AUGUST OF

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:03.664
TWENTY TWENTY ARE READILY

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:05.966
MOBILIZED IF NEEDED. NOW IT IS

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:07.134
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SO YOU

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:09.470
SEE IS ACTUALLY WORKING ON THIS

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:11.238
CONTINGENCY PLAN THAT'S

AND CONTINUE CAPE. IF WE GET

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:18.899
INTO THIS EXTREME HEAT. EVENTS

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:20.868
SO I CAN. HOW WERE. BONNEVILLE

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:22.002
POWER TO. YOU GOT MORE THAN YOU.

01:42:22.069 --> 01:42:24.505
NOW AREA. BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:42:24.571 --> 01:42:26.540
WE'RE IMPORTING I BELIEVE FROM

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:28.208
ALL OVER THE WEST AND I'M JUST

01:42:28.275 --> 01:42:30.944
CURIOUS. WHAT BECAUSE THE FACT

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:32.813
THAT WE HAVE LESS GENERATION IN

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.916
THE STATE- SO THAT WERE NET

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:38.185
IMPORTERS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF

01:42:38.252 --> 01:42:39.686
ANYONE KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THAT

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:41.855
QUESTION OTHER THAN ITS

01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:44.458
ECONOMICS BUT- MAYBE THE CPUC

01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:45.959
OR THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS AN

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:50.364
IDEA. WELL NUMBER I THINK YOU

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:53.600
NAILED THE- THE NAIL ON THE

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:55.502
HEAD IT'S IT IS IT DOES HAVE TO

01:42:55.569 --> 01:42:57.070
DO WITH ECONOMICS AND IT ALSO

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:59.873
HAS TO DO WITH THAT. AS AS

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:03.911
PRESIDENT- AND CEO MEANS- IT IS

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:05.512
SAID IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH

01:43:05.579 --> 01:43:09.016
WHERE- WHERE THE ENERGY IS ONE

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:10.183
THERE'S NEATLY UP WE HAVE

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:12.486
STATES THAT- WE'RE NEIGHBORS

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:14.521
NEIGHBORS OF OURS THAT HAVE A

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:15.956
GREATER NEED IN THE WINTER THAN

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:19.226
WE DO AND WE HAVE A GREATER

01:43:19.293 --> 01:43:20.394
NEED IN THE SUMMER THAN THEY DO.

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:23.263
SO IT'S SAY A FLOW AND THAT

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:27.467
LUCKILY WE'RE- VERY. CAPABLE OF

01:43:27.534 --> 01:43:32.205
MANAGING AND- TAKING PART OF-

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:35.976
BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S BOTH THE

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:38.412
TYPE OF SEASONAL NEEDS WE HAVE

01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:41.848
AND ECONOMICS. I WOULD JUST ADD

01:43:41.915 --> 01:43:43.216
TO THAT ONE ONE POINT OF

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:45.018
SETTLEMENT KIRK WHICH IS I

01:43:45.085 --> 01:43:47.454
THINK IT DOES A CREW TO OUR%

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:50.057
BENEFIT OVER TIME TO BE

01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:51.358
CONNECTED TO THE REST OF THE

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:53.327
WEST AND IF YOU COMPARE HERE

01:43:53.393 --> 01:43:54.528
WE'RE ALL HERE IN THIS HEARING

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:56.096
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:57.631
BECAUSE OF AN OUTAGE THAT

01:43:57.698 --> 01:43:58.799
LASTED TWO HOURS ON AUGUST

01:43:58.865 --> 01:44:00.734
FOURTEENTH AND THEN OUR HALF ON

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:02.703
AUGUST FIFTEENTH AFFECTED ABOUT

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:05.772
HALF MILLION CUSTOMERS THE

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:06.974
OUTAGE THAT TEXAS HAD. FEBRUARY

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.010
WAS FIVE HUNDRED TIMES WORSE SO

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:14.681
pCONSERVE THEY HAD- EIGHT

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:15.949
HUNDRED WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS.

01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:17.284
AND THEY ARE FUNCTIONALLY AN

01:44:17.351 --> 01:44:18.852
ISLAND AND SO I THINK VERY MUCH

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:20.754
YOU KNOW. THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED

01:44:20.821 --> 01:44:23.857
TO HAVE HAD- YOU KNOW ACCESS TO

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:24.725
SURROUNDING RESTORED MEAN JUST

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:26.760
GENERALLY. I DO THINK THE

01:44:26.827 --> 01:44:27.995
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:29.930
WEST- HAS ITS BENEFITS FOR

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:31.965
CALIFORNIA. YEAH I TURN NINETY

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:33.500
THREE ON THAT. I'M CERTAINLY

01:44:33.567 --> 01:44:36.637
SUPPORTER OF A WIDER BALANCING

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:38.438
AUTHORITY WITH THE I SO.

01:44:38.505 --> 01:44:40.140
CALIFORNIA IS SO MERGING WITH

01:44:40.207 --> 01:44:44.411
OTHERS BUT- WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:46.013
A- A NICE DREAM HOW NOT SURE

01:44:46.079 --> 01:44:47.948
WE'LL EVER GET THERE BUT DIE I

01:44:48.015 --> 01:44:50.250
APPRECIATE THAT- THERE'S-

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:51.718
BETTER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.220
BALANCING AUTHORITIES AND MAYBE

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:55.122
THAT'S WHAT WILL HAVE TO DO IF

01:44:55.188 --> 01:44:56.390
WE CAN'T. GET AROUND SOME OF

01:44:56.456 --> 01:44:59.359
THESE POLITICAL PROBLEMS BUT

01:44:59.426 --> 01:45:01.395
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NUMBER

01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.295
EIGHTY FIVE IF I MAY I'D JUST

01:45:02.362 --> 01:45:03.764
LIKE TO ADD ONE ADDITIONAL

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:05.465
DETAILS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:07.034
VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW.

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:09.536
CALIFORNIA IS GOING THROUGH-

01:45:09.603 --> 01:45:11.204
YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:13.440
ADEQUACY. CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:14.808
IN AND REALLY WORKING ON THAT

01:45:14.875 --> 01:45:16.076
ISSUE WITH A WITH ALL OF ITS

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:17.577
CAPABILITY BUT WE ARE NOT

01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:19.146
UNIQUE IN THAT- THIS IS AN

01:45:19.212 --> 01:45:20.681
ISSUE THAT IS NOW. PLAYING

01:45:20.747 --> 01:45:22.182
ACROSS THE WEST UNITED STATES

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:23.483
ACTUALLY ALL OF THE MAJOR

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:24.918
SUBREGIONS AND WESTERNIZED

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.987
STATES ARE DEPENDENT 21 DEGREES

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:28.855
ANOTHER ON IMPORTS. AND

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:30.924
ACTUALLY THE COMPETITION FOR

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:32.893
THOSE IMPORTS IS NOW BECOMING

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:35.228
INCREASINGLY. STRONG AND SO ONE

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:37.330
OF THE KEY THINGS ARE GIVEN

01:45:37.397 --> 01:45:38.198
THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUY

01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:39.533
POWER FROM OTHER REGIONS IS

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:40.467
THAT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:42.369
WERE DEPENDENT. ON THOSE

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:44.171
IMPORTS FOR OUR PEAK NEEDS WE

01:45:44.237 --> 01:45:45.639
NEED TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO

01:45:45.706 --> 01:45:47.374
DO FORWARD CONTRACTING IN LINE

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:48.475
AT THE SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:50.177
IMPORTANT FORWARD BASIS THAT'S

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:51.311
SOMETHING THAT ARE UTILITIES IN

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:53.280
THE STATE INCREASING ATTENTION

01:45:53.346 --> 01:45:53.814
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.582
HEDGING. THEIR EXPOSURE TO

01:45:55.649 --> 01:45:57.617
BILLS PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL

01:45:57.684 --> 01:45:59.486
RISKS IT'S A IT'S THAT FORWARD

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:00.754
CONTRACTING IN THOSE LONGER

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:04.324
TERM- BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS.

01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:05.926
INTO THE BROADER MARKET THAT

01:46:05.992 --> 01:46:08.328
COULD SUPPORT THAT CAN HELP US.

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:10.831
MANAGE THAT INTERDEPENDENCY

01:46:10.897 --> 01:46:15.969
WITHOUT IT. BECOMING TOO MUCH

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:16.803
OF A LIABILITY FOR US. YEAH MY

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:17.437
CONCERN THERE IS JUST THE WE

01:46:17.504 --> 01:46:19.005
HAVE ALL THE C. C. MANY OF

01:46:19.072 --> 01:46:22.142
WHICH ARE QUITE SMALL. AND

01:46:22.209 --> 01:46:23.944
DINNER SO I WORRY ABOUT.

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:26.413
COORDINATION OF THE GOING TO BE

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.116
SUPPLYING. OF VERY LARGE

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:31.151
FRACTION OF THE STATE'S ENERGY

01:46:31.218 --> 01:46:32.652
PROBABLY ALL OF IT IN SAN DIEGO

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:36.790
AND PATERNITY- AND- JUST THE

01:46:36.857 --> 01:46:39.192
FACT THAT THERE. MANY OF THEM

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:41.428
ARE JUST VERY SMALL IT'S HARD

01:46:41.495 --> 01:46:44.197
TO SEE HOW THAT- HOW WE

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:52.405
COORDINATE THAT. DR KIRK REALLY

01:46:52.472 --> 01:46:54.374
APPRECIATE IT- THAT QUESTION

01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:56.109
AND CERTAINLY ALL I CAN TELL

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:57.744
YOU IS KEEP THE FAITH- THERE

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.646
IS- OR THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:01.948
WAY- IF THERE ARE NO OTHER

01:47:02.015 --> 01:47:03.550
QUESTIONS I HAVE ONE LAST

01:47:03.617 --> 01:47:05.185
QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK AND

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:05.819
THEN WE'LL TURN TO PUBLIC

01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:08.321
COMMENT- AND AS DR COURT

01:47:08.388 --> 01:47:11.124
MENTIONED A CALIFORNIA REMAINS

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:12.759
STRONGLY IMPORT DEPENDENT. HOW

01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:13.760
MUCH CONFIDENCE DO WE HAVE

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:15.729
ANOTHER WESTERN WIDE HEATWAVE

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:17.430
OCCURS THAT OUR IMPORTS WILL

01:47:17.497 --> 01:47:19.900
SHOW UP. AND WHAT ADDITIONAL

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:22.102
INSIGHTS OR TOOLS WOULD BE

01:47:22.169 --> 01:47:23.804
HELPFUL FOR OUR SYSTEM PLANNING

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:25.472
GIVEN THE REGIONAL NATURE OF

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:27.440
OUR ELECTRIC GRID AND RESOURCE

01:47:27.507 --> 01:47:35.615

THE CONSEQUENCES OF A

01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:52.899
WIDESPREAD HEATING EVENTS- ARE

01:47:52.966 --> 01:47:54.734
THE SINGLE PUBLIC BIGGEST RISK

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:56.469
VARIABLE- THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:47:56.536 --> 01:47:57.637
LOOKING AT OUR OUR SUMMER

01:47:57.704 --> 01:47:59.439

CONSEQUENCES OF THAT AND SO ALL

01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:03.577

ALL OF OUR RISK ASSESSMENTS ARE

01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:06.713
REALLYBASED ABOUT BEING ABLE

COLLABORATION WITH OUR ADJACENT

01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:20.694
SYSTEM OPERATORS AND UTILITIES

IT'S JUST BECOMING A BIGGER AND

01:48:22.395 --> 01:48:23.530
BIGGER PART OF OUR FUTURE

01:48:23.597 --> 01:48:26.199
SUCCESS IN SERVE BETWEEN THE

ACROSS THE WEST WE BELIEVE THAT

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:43.316
THAT IS A PATHWAY TO NOT ONLY

01:48:43.383 --> 01:48:44.718
STRENGTHENING OUR ABILITY TO

01:48:44.784 --> 01:48:47.420

ACROSS THE WEST REACHING OUT TO

01:49:07.207 --> 01:49:09.209
CALIFORNIA. UNDERSTANDING OR

01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:10.777
CODEPENDENCY IS A WARNING TO

01:49:10.844 --> 01:49:11.745
CONTINUE TO CALL OF ALL BUT

01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:13.914
THAT'S NOT I THINK IT'S A REAL

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.682
OPPORTUNITY AND THAT WE'RE

AS THE VICE CHAIR. OF THIS

02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:08.694
COMMITTEE AND THE SAME.

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:10.362
DIFFICULTIES WE ARE FACING

02:06:10.429 --> 02:06:11.830
TODAY ARE THOSE THAT WE HAVE

02:06:11.897 --> 02:06:14.233
FACED IN RECENT YEARS. OUR

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:17.436
RELIABILITY IS DECREASING WELL

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:19.571
OUR COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE

02:06:19.638 --> 02:06:22.508
TO RATE PAYERS. AND HERE WE ARE

02:06:22.574 --> 02:06:24.643
TODAY GOING OVER THE SAME OLD

02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:31.183
GROUND. RELIABILITY KEEPS OUR.

02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:32.952
ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS- AWAKE AT

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:37.022
NIGHT. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:38.524
TO PUT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY ON

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.459
THE GRID FOR THE DEMAND. AND AT

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:41.593
THE SAME TIME WE'RE SEEING

02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:45.030
COSTS GOING UP. TO RATE PAYERS

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:47.900
AND WHAT OUR SOLUTIONS- SAYING

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:49.702
TO CALIFORNIANS WHEN YOU COME

02:06:49.768 --> 02:06:52.071
HOME ON A HOT DAY STOP USING

02:06:52.137 --> 02:06:53.639
YOUR AIR CONDITIONING BETWEEN

02:06:53.706 --> 02:06:55.908
FOUR AND NINE O'CLOCK OR WASH

02:06:55.975 --> 02:06:57.276
YOUR CLOTHES IN A MUCH MORE

02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:59.812
INCONVENIENT TIME FOR COOK YOUR

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:01.580
DINNER DO OTHER CHORES THAT

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:04.149
REQUIRE ELECTRICITY AFTER NINE.

02:07:04.216 --> 02:07:09.488
PM THIS IS NOT A REAL REALITY-

02:07:09.555 --> 02:07:11.290
THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS CAN LIVE

02:07:11.357 --> 02:07:15.194
WITH. ON TOP OF THAT WE ARE

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:18.564
IMPLEMENTING TIME OF USE RATES.

02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:21.667
PRICING AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:24.703
IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING

02:07:24.770 --> 02:07:27.006
OUT OF THE REACH OF MILLIONS OF

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:29.942
CALIFORNIANS. WE ARE CREATING

02:07:30.009 --> 02:07:32.111
WHAT AMOUNTS TO RATE INDUCED

02:07:32.177 --> 02:07:35.514
SCARCITY. AND UNDER THE PHRASE

02:07:35.581 --> 02:07:36.415
AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:39.585
THAT TODAY AT DEMAND RESPONSE.

02:07:39.651 --> 02:07:42.121
WE ARE LITERALLY POWERING DOWN

02:07:42.187 --> 02:07:43.956
PORTIONS OF OUR ECONOMY.

02:07:44.023 --> 02:07:48.861
BECAUSE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPLY.

02:07:48.927 --> 02:07:51.030
THIS IS THE GRID THAT HAS BEEN

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:54.333
CREATED. IN THE FIFTH LARGEST

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:55.968
ECONOMY ON THE PLANET. HIGH

02:07:56.035 --> 02:08:00.339
COST QUESTIONABLE RELIABILITY

02:08:00.406 --> 02:08:02.141
PRICE INDUCED SCARCITY FOR MANY

02:08:02.207 --> 02:08:05.377
CALIFORNIANS. AND WE'RE FORCING

02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:07.079
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:09.281
MAKE THE EXCRUCIATING CHOICE.

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:11.517
YOU EITHER PAY RENT BUY

02:08:11.583 --> 02:08:13.585
GROCERIES OR PAY THE

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:16.622
ELECTRICITY BILL. WE HEARD

02:08:16.688 --> 02:08:18.791
TODAY FROM MANY OF THOSE WHO

02:08:18.857 --> 02:08:21.360
HAD THE BUREAUCRACIES TO

02:08:21.427 --> 02:08:25.898
OPERATE THIS GREAT. I AM MAKING

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:29.101
A PLEA FOR THE VOICES OF THOSE

02:08:29.168 --> 02:08:30.335
WHO HAVE TO USE THIS

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:33.005
ELECTRICITY AND PAY FOR IT.

02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:34.640
UNRELIABILITY GOES DOWN AND

02:08:34.706 --> 02:08:36.842
COSTS GO UP MILLIONS OF

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:39.044
CALIFORNIANS ARE FORCED AWAY

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:40.779
FROM AN ELECTRICITY GRID THAT

02:08:40.846 --> 02:08:42.414
IS RELIABLE THAT THEY CAN GO TO

02:08:42.481 --> 02:08:44.817
THE WALL TURN IT ON. CAN AFFORD

02:08:44.883 --> 02:08:49.455
TO USE IT. WE CONTINUE TO SEE.

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:52.057
THIS DIFFICULT DICHOTOMY

02:08:52.124 --> 02:08:54.593
RELIABILITY ON THE DECLINE.

02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:56.462
COST ON THE INCREASE

02:08:56.528 --> 02:09:00.466
ESSENTIALLY. TELLING PEOPLE TO

02:09:00.532 --> 02:09:01.934
USE THEIR ELECTRICITY AT

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.336
INCONVENIENT TIMES. EMPOWERING

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:05.737
DOWN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

02:09:05.804 --> 02:09:08.540
OUR ECONOMY. I DON'T THINK THIS

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:10.876
IS AN ACCEPTABLE SET OF

02:09:10.943 --> 02:09:13.212
CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNFORTUNATELY

02:09:13.278 --> 02:09:14.046
IN EIGHT YEARS OF THE VICE

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:15.781
CHAIRMANSHIP HERE I HAVE SEEN

02:09:15.848 --> 02:09:18.550
NOTHING- THAT WOULD SATISFY MY

02:09:18.617 --> 02:09:20.853
CONCERN. THAT WE ARE CREATING

02:09:20.919 --> 02:09:23.789
AN ADEQUATE GRID FOR THE FIFTH

02:09:23.856 --> 02:09:27.593
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE PLANET.

02:09:27.659 --> 02:09:30.963
WE- THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE WE

02:09:31.029 --> 02:09:33.098
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- I

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:35.634
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE TO

02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:37.903
THOUGH THAT WE'RE IN A

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:41.140
TRANSITION PERIOD. WHICH BEGAN

02:09:41.206 --> 02:09:43.575
BEYOND THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE

02:09:43.642 --> 02:09:47.179
MENTIONED ON YOUR SERVICE.

02:09:47.246 --> 02:09:47.679
VALUABLE SERVICE TO THIS

02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:50.616
COMMITTEE. BUT THE TRANSITION

02:09:50.682 --> 02:09:53.352
IS MOVING US FROM FOSSIL FUELS

02:09:53.418 --> 02:09:55.554
TO RENEWABLE FORM OF ENERGY

02:09:55.621 --> 02:09:58.657
THAT CAN POWER GRID RECOGNIZING

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:00.659
THE IMPACTS OF A DROUGHT THAT

02:10:00.726 --> 02:10:02.728
HAS A SUSTAINABLE DROUGHT. THE

02:10:02.794 --> 02:10:04.196
RECOGNIZING THAT THE CLIMATE IS

02:10:04.263 --> 02:10:06.165
CHANGING AND IMPACTING ON OUR

02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:07.132
ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DO

02:10:07.199 --> 02:10:10.335
THINGS AS USUAL THEY GOT US

02:10:10.402 --> 02:10:14.740
INTO THIS MESS- WE ARE. WORKING

02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:17.009
HARD AS YOU KNOW AND- AND OUR

02:10:17.075 --> 02:10:19.511
ABILITY TO TRANSITION TO SMART

02:10:19.578 --> 02:10:22.247
TECHNOLOGY. STORAGE AND OTHER

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:25.250
FORMS WE HAVE RESOURCES THAT WE

02:10:25.317 --> 02:10:27.152
ARE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE.

02:10:27.219 --> 02:10:29.087
CONSULTANCY AREA LITHIUM

02:10:29.154 --> 02:10:30.255
DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL ALLOW FOR

02:10:30.322 --> 02:10:32.591
US TO HAVE GREATER TECHNOLOGY

02:10:32.658 --> 02:10:34.693
ADVANCES AROUND BATTERY

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:37.162
STORAGE. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF

02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:39.631
TRANSITION. AND I BELIEVE AS WE

02:10:39.698 --> 02:10:41.333
GO THROUGH THIS TRANSITION WE

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:43.635
HAVE BEEN VERY DILIGENT TO.

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:45.137
MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE TAKING

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:46.471
THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO

02:10:46.538 --> 02:10:48.941
PROTECT THE RATE PAYERS. AS YOU

02:10:49.007 --> 02:10:50.676
AND I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:52.411
TO COLLABORATE ON. THE

02:10:52.477 --> 02:10:53.579
DISCUSSION THAT LED TO A

02:10:53.645 --> 02:10:56.181
QUESTION HERE TODAY. IN TERMS

02:10:56.248 --> 02:10:58.450
OF WHAT DOES EXPANDING. OUR

02:10:58.517 --> 02:11:00.319
IMPACT OF OUR GRID. AND

02:11:00.385 --> 02:11:02.120
COLLABORATING WITH OTHER STATES

02:11:02.187 --> 02:11:04.289
MEAN IN TERMS OF DRIVING COSTS

02:11:04.356 --> 02:11:07.159
DOWN. AND WE HAVE SHOWN THAT IT

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:08.727
IS GOING TO BE VERY VALUABLE TO

02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:11.096
THAT END. EVEN IN THE-

02:11:11.163 --> 02:11:12.664
EXPLORATION OF THE ENERGY

02:11:12.731 --> 02:11:14.600
IMBALANCE MARKET IS LEADING US

02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:15.767
IN THE PAST THAT UNDERSTANDS

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:17.002
THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET US IN

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:18.904
A MUCH BETTER PLACE. SURE WE

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:20.672
ARE ABLE TO EXPAND ON THAT BUT

02:11:20.739 --> 02:11:21.840
EVEN IF WE JUST ARE AT THE

02:11:21.907 --> 02:11:24.042
PLACE OF UTILIZING THE YEAH I

02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:26.545
AM IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO

02:11:26.612 --> 02:11:28.247
PROVIDE. ECONOMIC BENEFITS. THE

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:31.049
SERVICE IS NOT EASY- THIS IS

02:11:31.116 --> 02:11:31.717
VERY DIFFICULT AND WE'RE ALL

02:11:31.783 --> 02:11:35.087
STRUGGLING. AS WE GO THROUGH.

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:38.624
YEARS OF MASSIVE WILDFIRES. NOW

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:40.192
HEAT WAVES THAT ARE IMPACTING

02:11:40.259 --> 02:11:42.261
ON THE STABILITY OF THE GRID

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:44.329
BUT AT THE SAME TIME. MAKING

02:11:44.396 --> 02:11:48.667
TRANSITION TO ADDRESS. THE NEED

02:11:48.734 --> 02:11:51.136
TO TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUEL.

02:11:51.203 --> 02:11:51.737
TO RENEWABLE ENERGY SO I THINK

02:11:51.803 --> 02:11:54.806
THAT- IT'S NOT EASY BUT GREAT

02:11:54.873 --> 02:11:57.042
THINGS DON'T HAPPEN EASILY-

02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:59.344
REQUIRES COMMITMENT IT REQUIRES

02:11:59.411 --> 02:12:01.346
DEDICATION IT REQUIRES.

02:12:01.413 --> 02:12:02.514
PERSEVERANCE AND WE HAVE TO DO

02:12:02.581 --> 02:12:04.583
THIS COLLABORATIVELY AS AN

02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:07.152
ENTIRE STATE AS INDUSTRY AS

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:08.954
REGULATORY AS GOVERNMENT AS

02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:11.189
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE STATE

02:12:11.256 --> 02:12:13.392
EVERYONE DOING THEIR PART.

02:12:13.458 --> 02:12:15.060
WE'RE IN UNCHARTED WATERS IN

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:17.562
MANY WAYS BECAUSE- WHEN LAST

02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:19.264
SUMMER WE SAW A HUNDRED AND

02:12:19.331 --> 02:12:20.899
22 DEGREES TEMPERATURE HEAT IN

PRESENT THAT YOU JUST SAID

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:40.639

BECAUSE AS BAD AS THIS IS IT

02:15:03.762 --> 02:15:05.730
