WAR HE WILL HEAR FROM SOME THAT THE INITIATIVE POWER IN ARTICLE TWO OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION TRUMPETS TRUMPS THE TWO THIRDS VOTE THRESHOLD FOR LOCAL SPECIAL TAXES WHICH COULD SPECIAL TAXES. BY MAJORITY VOTE WHEN DONE SO BY AN INITIATIVE. SO TODAY WE HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER THE TOP MINDS IN CALIFORNIA TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING AREAS. DOES THIS DECISION ALLOW LOCAL INITIATIVES TO IMPOSE SPECIAL TAXES BY MAJORITY VOTE. DOES IT CHANGE THE JOB THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE TO DO SO IT FOR IT WILL MAKE FOR AN INTERESTING DECISION. IN A LIVELY CONVERSATION HERE TODAY. BUT WE DID ASKED WE DID NOT ASK ANY THE PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS WHO WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE COURT CASE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY.

SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION I'M LOOKING FOR DID LISTENING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IF WE HAVE ANY SOME KIND OF NEW OUTCOME THAT WE DIDN'T THINK THAT. AND I WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIRMAN A CHAIRMAN MAGUIRES AND WIRE AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE. AND. WHEN WE GET IT GO AHEAD AND GET THIS GOING SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH DEAR WOMAN THAT WE NOW LIKE A BITTER WELCOME CAROLINE SHUE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO SET THE STAGE FOR OUR DISCUSSION TODAY. SHE'S GONNA BE PROVIDING US WITH THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW F THE CASE. AND AN OVERVIEW AND WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISSED YOU FOR BEING WITH US HERE TODAY. ISSUE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP WITHIN SEVEN TO EIGHT MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND HEADS UP. AND AGAIN WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR REVIEW AS WE HEAD INTO TODAY'S HEARING THE FLOOR IS YOURS MA'AM. THANK YOU SO YES CAROLINE TO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M JUST GONNA DO A BE A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE CHANGES TO VOTER REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL TAXES. AND THEN SET UP SOME FACTS OF THE CASE. AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN WHAT WE SAW IN THE LAST ELECTION WITH REGARD TO. LOCAL VOTER FRAUD TAXES ENTER AND APPROVAL AND PASSAGE. SO I'VE BELIEVE THE SURGEON HAS HANDED OUT. A HAND UP IT'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE FIRST PAGE. AFTER THE TITLE PAGE IS A FIGURE IT'S A TIME LINE UNABRIDGED TIMELINE I SHOULD HIGHLIGHT THIS DOESN'T IT NOT ALL ENCOMPASSING. THAT WALKS YOU THROUGH THE CHANGES TO VOTER REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAXES OVER TIME SO GOES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT. AND ON THE TOP IS GENERAL TAXES AND ON THE BOTTOM ARE SPECIAL TAXES AND IT THE BOLD. FONT IS MEANT TO INDICATE CHANGES TO THE VOTER THRESHOLDS FOR THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TAXES. SO AS YOU KNOW PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THERE WERE NO VOTER REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL ATTACKS TAXES PROPOSITION THIRTEEN CHANGED ALL OF THAT. A AND IT REQUIRED THAT THE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE A TWO THIRDS VOTE OR APPROVAL FOR SPECIAL TAXES HOWEVER THE MEASURE DID NOT INCLUDE A DEFINITION OF SPECIAL TAXES SO THERE ARE SOME AMBIGUITY. AS TO WHAT THAT MEANT AS TO WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF TAX MEASURES. THE FEDERAL DECISION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TO CHANGE THAT AND IT FOUND THAT A SPECIAL TAX IS DEFINED AS A TAX LEVIED FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE SO FOR INSTANCE A TAX LEVIED. A SALES TAX LEVY PRESS. MOVING FORWARD IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX PROPOSITION SIXTY TWO WAS PASSED THAT WAS A STATUTORY MEASURE THAT ESTABLISHED A SIMPLE MAJORITY REQUIREMENT FOR GENERAL TAXES BUT IT MADE NO CHANGES TO SPECIAL TAXES. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WE HAD THE KNOX DECISION WHICH FOUND THAT PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS WERE NOT SUBJECT TO VOTER APPROVAL THERE IS SOME QUESTION ABOUT THAT. IN DIFFERENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ASSESSMENT OF OF PROPERTY. FOR MAINTENANCE AND THAT SORT OF THING. OUT AND THEN IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE HAD PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN WHICH IS THE MEASURE A QUESTION HERE TODAY. PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN EXTENDED THE SIMPLE MAJORITY REQUIREMENT FOR GENERAL TAXES TO CHARTER CITIES BY MAKING IT A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT PREVIOUSLY AS I MENTIONED WAS SIMPLY A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. AMENDED ALSO EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF A SPECIAL TAX TO INCLUDE ANY TAX LEVIED BY A SPECIAL DISTRICT SCHOOL. OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND IT ALSO DEFINED PARCEL TAXES A SPECIAL TAXES. THE PORTIONS OF. PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN THAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING TODAY HAVE TO DO WITH THE TIMING OF. THE ELECTION FOR A GENERAL TAX. AND THE DEFINITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. FOR SPECIAL TAXES. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE'RE PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX WHICH EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF A TAX SUBJECT TO VOTER APPROVAL. EE MANY FEES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAD BEEN LIVING. WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS BECAME SUBJECT TO VOTER APPROVAL. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY WE HAVE THE UPLAND DECISION. WHICH FOUND SPECIFICALLY THE TAX INITIATIVES TAX INITIATIVES BY THE VOTERS CAN BE APPROVED IN A SPECIAL ELECTION BUT THE EFFECT ON. SPECIAL TAXES REMAINS UNCLEAR. SO JUST TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE SOME QUICK BACKGROUND ON ON THE INITIATIVE THAT THAT CHAIR ALREADY MENTIONED THE CASE FOR A FOCUSED ON A LOCAL MARIJUANA INITIATIVE THE INITIATIVE SOUGHT TO. REPEAL THE CITY OF UPLANDS BAN ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES INSTITUTE REGULATIONS. INSTITUTE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR REGULATORY OR. LICENSING FEE FOR DISPENSARIES. AND THE PROPONENTS REQUESTED THAT THE MEASURE BE. PUT TO THE VOTERS AT A SPECIAL ELECTION. THE FEE WAS FOUND BY THE CITY TO CONSTITUTE A GENERAL TAX EXCEEDING THE COSTS OF LICENSING FOR THE CITY. AND AS A RESULT THE CITY DETERMINED THAT THE MEASURE HAD TO BE PUT TO THE VOTERS AT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION. SUBSEQUENTLY THE MEASURE WAS DEFEATED THAT SAID TURNING TO THE THIRD PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. THE PROPONENTS DIDN'T FILE A PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE. SUBMITTING THAT THE VOTERS AT THAT SUBMITTING THAT THE INITIATIVE SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTERS AT A SPECIAL ELECTION AND THAT. THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN DID NOT APPLY BECAUSE IT WAS. THE FEE WAS NOT A TAX AND MORE WAS NOT BEING IMPOSED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE SUPERIOR COURT DENIED THE PETITION ON AND FIND FOUND THAT THE FEE WAS IN FACT A TAX AND HAD TO BE PLACED ON THE GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT. THE COURT OF APPEAL REVERSED. AND THE SUPREME COURT AFFIRMED THAT DECISION SPECIFICALLY THE SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS USED IN ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE SECTION TO BE. IS DOES NOT INCLUDE VOTER INITIATIVES THAT IS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT INCLUSIVE OF THE ELECTORATE AS USED IN THAT A PORTION OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION WAS BASED. WAS BASED IN PART ON PROTECTING THE INITIATIVE POWER. SO THE I'M TURNING TO PAGE FOR THE CASE IMPLICATIONS AS THE CHAIR ALREADY MENTIONED. ON THE COMP ONE OF THE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CASE IS THAT NOW VOTER PROPOSE TAXES CAN BE APPROVED OF BY SPECIAL ACTION. OUTSTANDING QUESTION THAT YOUR PANELS WILL TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THAT BOTH SECTION TO BE AND SECTION TWO D. B. AS IN BRAVO D. AS IN DELTA. OF BOTH REFERENCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IMPOSED TAXES AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE DEFINITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THOSE TWO SECTIONS IS THE SAME. IF LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ELECTION THE ELECTORATE AD SECTION TWO D. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LOCAL SPECIAL TAX INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT. IMPOSED IMPOSED ON THEM CURRENTLY. SO LASTLY ON THE FINAL PAGE ON WHAT COULD THIS ALL MEAN FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS INTERPRETED TO NOT INCLUDE THE ELECTORATE. HAD ME IN THAT SPECIAL TAXES COULD PASS MORE FREQUENTLY THIS THE CHART ON THIS PAGE SHOWS THE OUTCOMES FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN LOCAL MEASURES. YOU'LL SEE THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES A PROPOSED A HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR GENERAL TAXES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY ARE THE ONLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT CAN IMPOSE GENERAL TAXES. AND THOSE. PASS AT AT AN EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT RATE. IN CONTRAST CITIES AND COUNTIES ONLY PROPOSE SIXTY TWO SPECIAL TAX MEASURES AND THOSE ON THE PAST FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE TIME. THE SPECIAL DISTRICT AND SCHOOL SPECIAL TAXES THERE WERE THIRTY SIXTY THREE SIXTY THREE SIXTY THREE OF THOSE THOSE PASS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHER RATE AT SIXTY TWO PERCENT. SO WHAT THIS COULD MEAN THAT LOWERING THE VOTE THRESHOLD FOR VOTER INITIATIVES COULD INCREASE THE PASSING RATE PARTICULARLY FOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS. WHICH ARE WHOSE TAX MEASURES ARE ALL CONSIDERED SPECIAL TAXES. BUT RIGHT NOW THE IMPACT FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES OF WHAT'S CLEAR IN PART BECAUSE THEY ALREADY CAN INCLUDE A NON BINDING ADVISORY MEASURE OUT. AT A LOWER THRESHOLD FOR GENERAL TAXES. WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISSED YOU A THANK YOU FOR THE ANALYSIS THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF THE CHAIR WOMAN HAD ANY QUESTIONS AND WE LIKE TO BE OPENED UP FOR COMMITTEE IF THAT'S OKAY. OKAY. SIR MORLOCK. IT'S ALL GOOD I JUST. JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE STATE SUPREME COURT ONLY ACCEPTS ABOUT TWO PERCENT OF THE CASES. THAT ARE. BUT BEFORE THEN. I I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE THE RATE THAT. THAT AT WHICH THEY ACCEPT CASES BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU YEAH WELL THAT'S WHAT. FORMER SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SUBMARINO JUST TOLD ME YESTERDAY IN THIS VERY ROOM. SO I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM IT. BUT TO. SINCE THE SUPREME COURT ENDED UP AGREEING WITH THE APPELLATE COURT THEY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE CASE A GUY JUST SAID NO. AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE SO I'M JUST CURIOUS. IF YOU KNOW WHY THEY TOOK THE CASE AND IF YOU KNOW. MAYBE IF YOU'RE A STUDENT OF THE STATE SUPREME COURT. WHAT CRITERIA DO THEY USED TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ACCEPT MUNICIPALITY? FINANCE RELATED CASES. I AM NOT A LAWYER MYSELF SO THAT QUESTION MAY BE BETTER POST TO YOUR OB PANELS LETTERS COM. THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER. SOME RESEARCH WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE LA RAIL. OKAY IF YOU THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. IT IS GERMAN THE COMMITTEE WOULD NOW LIKE TO MOVE ON TO OUR. LEGAL PANEL IF WE COULD HAVE EACH OF OUR PANELISTS PLEASE COME FORWARD WE'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR PANEL ALL AT ONCE. IN IF IT WORKS FOR THE COMMITTEE AND WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS. EACH INDIVIDUAL AFTER EACH INDIVIDUAL PRESENTS FIRST WE HAVE. MICHAEL CALL IN TO KNOW HE'S A SHAREHOLDER COMING TO KNOW HIGHSMITH IN WHAT LEE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE SOLICIT MICHAEL'S EXPERTISE IN A BROAD RANGE OF AREAS INCLUDING CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND TAXES HE IS ONE OF THE STATE'S FOREMOST EXPERTS ON PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIX. UNDER A PARAPHRASE WHAT MICHAEL'S STANCE ISN'T FEEL FREE TO CORRECT ME MICHAEL BUT HE BELIEVES THAT THE VOTE THRESHOLD TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT REMAINS INTACT AND HE'S GOING TO pA BIT. SECOND WE'VE KELLY SALT SHE'S A PARTNER IN BEST BEST IN KRIEGER PUBLIC FINANCE PRACTICE GROUP KELLY WORKED WITH THE UBLIC AGENCIES ON BOND MUNICIPAL FINANCE MATTERS. RATE SITTING IN COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIX. NOW KELLY LEANS TWO THIRDS VOTE ABOUT BELIEVES THERE GOING TO FORWARD. NEXT THE FREQUENT VISITOR TO THE COMMITTEE. WITH MR SHARANSKY FROM YOU SEE THE EASY DAVIS AND AS AT TRUMAN SAYS GO AGGIES MY RIGHT. MAY. A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UC DAVIS HE SPECIALIZES IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXATION LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAW PUBLIC FINANCE AND POLITICAL THEORY. AND BELIEVES THAT THIS CASE IS OVERTURN THE TO THROW TWO THIRDS THRESHOLD GOING TOWARD SIMPLE MAJORITY FOR SPECIAL TAXES OUT WITH LOCAL INITIATIVES IN THAT. THAT RULES THE DAY IN BATTING CLEANUP WE HAVE GREG TURNER WHO HAS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OF STATE AND LOCAL TAX EXPERIENCE BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF CITY GOVERNMENT. GREAT BELIEVES THAT THE SUPREME COURT CASE WAS CLEAR IT'S NOW SIMPLE MAJORITY BUT BELIEVES IT IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. SO COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE LET'S KICK OFF OUR PANEL AND WE WELCOME MICHAEL THAT MICHAEL WE'RE GOING TO BE GIVING YOU SEVEN TO EIGHT MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND HEADS UP. WHEN YOU ARE GETTING CLOSING IN ON THE EIGHT MINUTE MARK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ATTEND TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY LET ME START BY ANSWERING CENTER MORE LATCHES QUESTION ON THE SUPREME COURT HAS THREE AREAS OF PRACTICE THAT CASES WHICH THEY MUST TAKE. CIVIL CASES WHICH THEY CHOOSE FROM AND CRIMINAL CASES LESS THAN DEATH WHICH THEY CHOOSE FROM. THEY GET SOMETHING LIKE NINE THOUSAND CIVIL PETITIONS A YEAR AND THEY TAKE ABOUT TWO PERCENT OF THOSE CASES SO THE DATE OF YOUR TALK ABOUT OUR CIVIL CASES INCLUDING THESE. THIS CASE WAS MOOT WHEN THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED IT. BECAUSE THE VOTERS OF UPLAND EVERY DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL BY A SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN. THE SUPREME COURT TOOK THE CASE ANYWAY AND THEY TOOK IT UNDER A RULE OF COURT WHICH EXPLAINS WHAT HOW THEY. APPLY THEIR RESOURCES TO SERVE THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE ESSENCE OF THE RULE IS THE BASE DECIDE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND THEY RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN THE LAW. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE HAD THAT THIS IS EASILY CHARACTERIZED AS A CONFLICT IN THE LAW AT THE TIME THAT THE COURT APPEAL HAD DECIDED IT. SO I THINK THEY MUST DETERMINE THAT IT WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION. THERE'S ANOTHER IRONY IN THIS CASE AND THAT IS THAT THE THE SEED OF THE IDEA. TO DISTINGUISH THE VOTERS ACTING BY INITIATIVE A FROM THE GOVERNMENT CAME FROM ANIMAGUS BRIEF WRITTEN BY REALLY FINE FIRM IN LOS ANGELES ON BEHALF OF THE CHARGERS WHO HAD A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. TO FINANCE A NEW FOOTBALL STADIUM AND AFTER THAT MEASURE DIDN'T HE GET EVEN FIFTY PERCENT MUCH LESS TWO THIRDS. THE AUTHOR OF THE BRIEF TRY TO WITHDRAW IT BUT THE DEED WAS DONE THE IDEA WAS PLANTED IN IT IT GREW INTO WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY SO THERE LOTS OF. CONTINGENCIES OF HISTORY WITH BEFORE US. I WANT TO COVER UP BRIEFLY PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU JUST HEARD BUT FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES ARE SO THOROUGHLY REGULATED THESE DAYS BY THE WORK OF GENERATIONS OF INITIATIVE DRAFTERS THAT. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT EACH TYPE OF REVENUES SQUARELY COMPLIES WITH A BUNCH OF COMPLICATED RULES. SO A REGULATORY FEE ON A MARIJUANA DISPENSARY TO COVER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COSTS TO REGULATE THAT SPENDS THREE MUST BE SHOWN TO RECOVER ONLY THOSE COSTS. AND IF THERE'S EXTRA MONEY IN THE SYSTEM IT BECOMES ATTACKS REQUIRING VOTER APPROVAL. HERE YOU HAD A SITUATION WHICH HAD A CITY COUNCIL SERVING A COMMUNITY THAT DID NOT WANT MEDICAL MAN OF MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY ADOPTED A BAM. THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH THAT POLICY PROPOSED INITIATIVE. PERHAPS FOR POLITICAL REASONS TO TRY TO MAKE THE MEASURE MORE SALEABLE AND TO DEFEAT AN ARGUMENT THAT IT WAS GOING TO COST THE CITY MONEY. PUT IN THIS PROVISION THAT SAID SEVENTY FIVE GRAND PER YEAR PER DISPENSARY TO MAKE THE CITY HALL OF THE CITY. FATHERS AND MOTHERS SO TO SPEAK HAVE THE STAFF TO AN ALLISON SAID WHEN I CAN SPEND ANYWHERE NEAR THAT WE SPEND ABOUT TEN THEREFORE IT'S A GENERAL TAX AND THEREFORE WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT THIS. ON A SPECIAL ELECTION BALLOTWE CAN PUT IT ON OUR NEXT GENERAL EX IN BALANCE WHICH WAS AT THAT POINT WAS MORE THAN TWO YEARS AWAY. AND EVERYONE ON THIS BODY KNOWS THE TIMING IS EVERYTHING AND POLITICS AND THAT WAS WORTH FIGHTING OVER AND FIGHT THEY DID. YET ANOTHER IRONY. YOUR LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL THIS YEAR TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF INITIATIVES CALLING FOR A SPECIAL ELECTION DATES ANYMORE HAS LOTS OF THINGS ABOUT THIS THAT ARE. CONTINGENT NOTES THAT ADI'S THEM HISTORY PLAYS OUT IN THE ODD WAY THAT HISTORY PLAYS OUT. SO ON THE VERY ABLE LAWYER REPRESENTING THE INITIATIVE PROPONENTS IN THIS CASE BRODERICK PETITION BEFORE THIS COURT. THE SUPERIOR COURT WAS PERSUADED ON OF THE TOWN'S POSITION AND KEPT THE MATTER OFF THE BALLOT. APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEAL IN RIVERSIDE. REVERSED DIDN'T PUBLISH AN OPINION SAYING GIVE THEM THEIR ELECTION ANSWERING COURT TOOK THE CASE AND REACH THE RESULT THAT IT DID. WHAT I MOST OFTEN SAY ABOUT UPLAND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS AN ADVOCATE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I SHOULD DISCLOSE I WROTE IN ANY CASE BRIEF IN THE CASE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAD CALIFORNIA CITIES? AND WE HAD UNCOMMON COMMON CAUSE WITH HOWARD JARVIS IN THIS CASE BECAUSE CITIES FEAR BOARD LEADS THE LEAGUE OF CITIES FEARS. THAT IF IT'S TOO EASY TO PROPOSE SPECIAL TAXES AND TOO HARD TO POST GNERAL TAXES IN POLITICAL TERMS. THAT SPECIAL TAXES WILL PROLIFERATE AND WE WILL BE TIED DOWN IN OUR BUDGETING BY A THOUSAND TINY LITTLE PATIENCE STRAINS. AND THE UNSEXY NECESSARY GENERAL GOVERNMENT LIKE LEGAL FEES AND INSURANCE POLICIES AND RENT AND THE LIGHTING WILL NOT BE FUNDED AND THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE TOUCH AND FEEL AND CARE ABOUT. OBVIOUS SERVICE DELIVERY WILL BE AND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO RUN GOVERNMENT IN A RATIONAL WAY. SO WE HAD COMMON CAUSE WITH OUR DRIVERS IN THIS CASE AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT BOTH THE LEAGUE AND HOWARD JARVIS WERE DISAPPOINTED BY THE RESULT. THE. BUT AS I USUALLY SAY ABOUT THIS CASE IT'S MUCH LESS IMPORTANT WHAT IT SAYS. THEN WHAT IT MIGHT PORTEND ABOUT THE TREND OF THIS COURT AND THIS AREA A PUBLIC POLICY MAKING. BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE DECISION IS IN MY JUDGMENT ON HELPFULLY BROUGHT. THE SUPREME COURT KEEPS REFERRING TO SECTION TWO OR SECTION TO SUBDIVISION DE WELL EVEN SECTION TWO SUBDIVISION BE OF ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE A PROP TO EIGHTEEN HAS FIVE DISTINCT RULES IN IT. THERE FIVE DISTINCT IDEAS THAT REGULATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THAT ONE PARAGRAPH AND SO BY REFERRING TO THIS BOX OF THINGS WHEN REALLY ONLY ONE ELEMENT WAS IN ISSUE CREATED THE PORTENTOUS NIS THAT FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT. HOWARD JARVIS WROTE A PETITION FOR REHEARING IN THE CASE WHICH IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COURT TO ADJUST ITS OPINION AFTER THE DECISION WAS MADE. AND THE COURT SUBJECTIVELY DECLINED THE INVITATION UNLESS THE RELATIVELY BROADLY WORDED. DECISION ON THE BOOKS. THE NEXT STEP IN THIS STORY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ARM IS A CASE THAT I HANDLED ARMEN STILL HANDLING FOR THE CITY OF VENTURA. AND THIS IS A DISPUTE OVER GROUNDWATER AUGMENTATION CHARGES THAT THE CITY PAYS TO TAKE WATER OUT OF THE GROUND WATER TABLE TO SERVE ITS CONSTITUENTS. AND. THAT WAS LITIGATED UNDER PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AND PROP UP TWENTY SIX. I WON IN THE TRIAL COURT LOST IN THE COURT OF APPEAL SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THAT TO PERCENT SHOT TO THE SUPREME COURT. AND THE COURT SAID IN A VERY NARROW DECISION THAT I THINK REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THIS IS A THREE THREE COURT IN PARTISAN TERMS IF YOU WANT TO VIEW IT THAT WAY AND WE HAVE A VACANCY THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL FELT. BY JANUARY FOURTH I IMAGINE I'M PERHAPS NOT SOONER. AT SOME VERY NARROW DECISION ALL THE DECISIONS THAT WAS ITS TWENTY SIX NOT TO EIGHTEEN GO BACK TO THE TRIAL COURT AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER YOU PASS THAT TEST OR NOT. THE REASON I'M MENTIONING THE CASE IS THAT THERE WAS A FOOTNOTE IN THE ORIGINAL DECISION THAT NOBODY ASKED FOR AND NOBODY BRIEFED BUT SAID THE SPECIAL TAXES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A TWO THIRDS APPROVAL UNDER PROP THIRTEEN. ARE NOT THE SAME SPECIAL TAXES THAT ARE GOVERNED BY PROP TWO EIGHTEEN BECAUSE PROP THIRTEEN IS LIMITED TO PROPERTY TAXES. WELL THAT WAS VERY ON WELCOME NEWS TO OUR FRIENDS AT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION BECAUSE IT WAS ONE MORE PORTENT ON A PATH TOWARDS MAYBE FREEDOMS DO SPECIAL TAXES WITHOUT TWO THIRDS VOTE OR APPROVAL. THE COURT GOT THREE REQUESTS REHEARING IN THAT CASE I FILED ONE MY OPPONENTS FILED ONE HOWARD JARVIS WAS MERELY ANY CASE IN THAT CASE FILED ONE AND WE ALL GOT WHAT WE AK FOR. ALL OF US GOT THE CLARIFICATIONS WE WERE SEEKING AND THAT FOOTNOTE IS NO MORE. SO THAT THAT THAT CONCERN THAT THIS COURT IS MARCHING TOWARDS A DESTINATION WITH AN AGENDA DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TRUE AND AT LEAST IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN VENTURE. THERE ARE COMPETING READINGS OF UPLAND I. RAISED IT TO PRINT OUT WITHIN DAYS OF THE SESSION OR HOURS OF DECISION MY ANALYSIS SAYING. NOTHING TO SEE HERE. NOTHING CHANGED SOMETHING MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE IF IT DOES WE'LL LET YOU KNOW BUT DON'T GET TOO EXCITED. AND QUITE FRANKLY THAT WAS MOTIVATED BY TWO CONCERNS ONES I DIDN'T WANT MY CLIENT BASE CITIES LEAPING ONTO THIS PATH WHICH I THINK IS STILL DANGEROUS FOR THEM AND SECONDLY I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT A POLITICAL OPENING TO THOSE WHO WANT TO TAKE AWAY WHAT LITTLE REVENUE POWER. WE STILL HAVE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT BY CREATING A FALSE SENSE OF CRISIS WHERE THERE ISN'T ONE SO I'M BEING HONEST I GOT APPOINTED YOU. THE SAME DAY THAT I'M GETTING MINE HOUSES OUT MY COMPETITORS ANOTHER FIND LAW FIRMS AROUND THE STATE INCLUDING ONE TO MY ON MY RIGHT HERE HAD A COMPETING IN HOUSES. THAT WERE FREER TO PREDICT THAT SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAD HAPPENED AND THEN WE GOT. OPINION FOR THE ELECTED CITY ATTORNEY OF SAN FRANCISCO POSTED TO THE WEBSITE OF THAT A CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ADVISING THE ELECTION OFFICIALS OF THAT CITY THAT SHOULD THEY GET AN INITIATIVE TAX PROPOSAL. THAT THEY WILL OPINE THAT IT ONLY NEEDS FIFTY PERCENT APPROVAL EVEN IF IT'S A SPECIAL TAX. ONE OF MY ADVISING MY CLIENTS. I'M TELLING THEM IF YOU WANT MONEY TO DELIVER SERVICES GET TWO THIRDS. IF YOU WANT TO BECAUSE YOU CAN GET SUED AND TAKE A CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT AND MAYBE CHANGE THE LAW GETS FIFTY PERCENT. EITHER WITH ONE MINUTE AND I DON'T THINK I NEED IT I WILL LAST HOW THE FOR MY TIME TO KELLY AND OTHERS AT THIS POINT NOW THINK YOU SO MUCH MICHAEL WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MIKE OR IF YOU'D LIKE TO BE TO. GO STRAIGHT TO AN INSULT TO ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT IF IT'S WORKS FOR THE COMMITTEE LET'S WELCOME ASSAULT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR EXPERTISE. MY PLEASURE ONLY PRESSED THE SPINE REMARKS BY. THE PAIN IS EXPRESSED TODAY ARE MINE NOT A SLAVE MY FIRM OR ANY PARTICULAR CLIENT. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY I AGREE ENTIRELY WITH MICHAEL. AND AGAIN ANOTHER THOUGHT I JUST WANT YOU TO KEEP IN MIND IS. BY BACKGROUND I DO BOND DISCLOSURE COUNSEL WORK IN ADDITION THE PROP TO EIGHTEEN WORK. AND BY NATURE BONNIE DISCLOSURE COUNSEL ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE AND RISK AVERSE BECAUSE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR CLIENTS. SELECT MICHAEL. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADVISE MY CLIENTS UNTIL THERE'S CLARITY PROVIDED BY THE SUPREME COURT. ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS EXTENDS TO THE CONCEPT OF ALLOWING. MAJORITY VOTER APPROVAL FOR CITIZENS INITIATIVE I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY SOME TO CONTINUE TO SEEK A TWO THIRDS VOTE APPROVAL FOR ANY. TAX MEASURE OF THIS SPECIAL TAX BY DEFINITION. I'M SO WITHOUT I MEAN I DID WHAT WE TRIED TO DO IS DIVVY UP KIND OF OUR OUR PRESENTATIONS FOR YOU TOO SO WE WERE DUPLICATING EACH OTHER. AND SO I WENT TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN POSED AND SO THE FIRST QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH AS A HOLDING AND IN THE CASE. OF CITIZENS GROUPS. THE LOCAL INITIATIVES IMPOSE SPECIAL TAXES TO ENACT THE BY MAJORITY VOTE. I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST THE COURT DECLINED TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION. IT WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION AND A CONTINUED DECLINE THAT. SO THEY THEY CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THEY'RE HOLDING WAS ONLY PARTICULAR TO THE TIMING OF ELECTIONS FOR CHANNEL TAXES EXES ME TAXES AND BY INITIATIVE. AND THE TIMING FOR THOSE. SO BASED UPON THAT I'M NOT WILLING TO RELY UPON THE EXTENSION OF THAT AT THIS TIME IN ADVISING MY CLIENTS THAT THEY SHOULD CONTINUE WITH. IN THE EVENT OF A VOTER INITIATIVE TO ALLOW FOR THE ADOPTION OF A SPECIAL TAX YOUR VOTE INITIATIVE IN A MAJORITY VOTER APPROVAL. THE SECOND QUESTION WAS HAS THE ROLE OF LOCAL AGENCIES IN DETERMINE APPROPRIATE VOTER THRESHOLD. VERSUS A NATION IS PROPOSING TO IMPOSE SPECIAL TAXES CHANGES RESULT OF THE POLITICIZATION. AGAIN IT BECAUSE OF COURSE REFUSAL I THINK WE WOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE THE SAME POSITION WITH A GUARD THE TWO THIRDS VOTE APPROVAL FOR A SPECIAL TAX. AND THIRD IS THE UPLAND HOLDING APPLY ONLY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES OR DOES IT ALSO APPLY TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AGAINST. US CITIES EXCEPT CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE THE ONLY ONES ALLOWED TO OPPOSE GENERAL TAXES. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE GONNA GOING TO EXTEND THIS BALLOT AT THE OR EXCUSE ME THIS INTERPRETATION OF THE TIMING OF ELECTION. IT'S APPLICABLE SPECIFICALLY TO TO. CITIES AND COUNTIES ONLY. IF YOU ARE TO EXTEND IT TO THE VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENT LEVEL FOR ANY SPECIAL TAX AND CERTAINLY IT WOULD. IMPACT ANY OF SPECIAL TAX ELECTION. FOR EIGHT DAYS A SPECIAL DISTRICT OR SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO ULTIMATELY I THINK IT IT'S GONNA DEPEND IN OUR VIEW ON WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT AT SOME POINT THE FUTURE OR THE LEGISLATURE OR THE VOTERS EXTEND THIS CONCEPT OF. VOTER APPROVAL LEVELS FOR MAJORITY OF FOR SPECIAL TAXES. AND WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THE UPLAND DECISION ON TAXPAYERS. BASICALLY THAT DECISION REQUIRES CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ORDER A SPECIAL THIS ELECTION ON ASUS IS INITIATED MEASURE THAT RECEIVES IT REQUISITE NUMBER. ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN THE LECTURES CODE IN THAT IN THAT REGARD. IF COURT LATER TERM IS THAT THE ALBUM DECISION EXTENDS TO THE VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION ARTICLE TWO. ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE SECTION TWO. SUBDIVISIONS A ND THAN ANY CITIZENS INITIATIVE PROPOSE A TAX WOULD ONLY REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF A MAJORITY THE QUALIFIED VOTERS. SO AGAIN I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE CLARIFICATIONS BEFORE THE COURTS. BEFORE WE EXTEND THAT CONCEPT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES WELL THINKING LIKE A BOND ATTORNEY. I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IF THERE IS OF THE CITIZENS INITIATIVE. AND THE REVENUES FROM THOSE TAXES ARE GOING TO BE USED TO SECURE SECURITY BONDED INDEBTEDNESS. I'M GONNA HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF OPINIONS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE PROVIDED WITH REGARD TO THOSE BONDS. YOU HAVE TO. GIVE OPINIONS WITH REGARD TO THE VALIDITY BONDS REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH BACING THOSE BONDS AS WELL AS PROVIDING AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT WHICH PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECURITY FOR THE BONDS. AS WELL AS ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS AND CERTAINLY THERE'LL HAVE TO BE A LOT OF INFORMATION PROVIDED. IF YOU ARE GOING TO RELY UPON THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO EXTEND THE CONCEPT. A MAJORITY VOTER APPROVAL FOR A SPECIAL TAXI A CITIZENS INITIATIVE. IF THE BOSS SECURE BY THOSE TAXES. SO AGAIN I THINK THERE'S RISK TO. OUR LOCAL AGENCIES FIRST AND FOREMOST I MEAN MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY'RE NOT THE SUBJECTIVITY LITIGATION. I SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. I THINK AT THIS TIME YOU KNOW. WHETHER NOT YOU PROVIDE ANY CLARIFICATION AND THE PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN ON THE DISCIPLINE IMPLEMENTATION ACT. CERTAINLY THE COURTS ARE STILL THE ONES WHO ARE GIVEN THE. THE OBLIGATION TO INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION. WERE NOT ANY THAT CLEAR FACE CLARIFY LEGISLATION BE HELPFUL IS UNCERTAIN I THINK. ULTIMATELY I THINK THE DECISION WILL HAVE TO BE FURTHER DEVELOPED BY THE COURTS. FOREVER. OR BY THE VOTERS ON THROUGH A FURTHER AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION. IF THAT I WILL. HEADED OVER TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH BUSINESS WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRMAN HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CHAIRMAN. SO AS A RESULT OF THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THIS CASE DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE WE SEE MORE CITIZEN INITIATIVES PROPOSING SPECIAL TAXES THE VOTERS MAY FACE. OVER FACE TAX OVER SATURATION OF THE BALLOT. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING MEASURES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GONE WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE CITY COUNCIL THAT AREN'T GOING TO THE CITY COUNCIL TO GOING THE INITIATIVE ROUTE. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CONTROL THE ELECTION DATE AND BECAUSE THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT SOLO. IT'S A IT'S THE SAME STANDARD FOR A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE WHICH MEANS FIVE PERCENT OF THE NUMBER OF VOTERS WHO CAST A VOTE IN THE LAST GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION. HAS GIVEN ISRAEL TURNOUTS ARE COMMONLY IN THE FORTY PERCENT RANGE FIVE PERCENT TO FORTY PERCENT IS TWO PERCENT. THANK YOU SOLD ANY ITEMS YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT. OKAY I COMPLETELY CONCUR WE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE. GREAT. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THUS FAR BEFORE RETURN OF RUSSIAN SKI. THANK YOU COMMUNICATE YOUR WOMAN CHANCE COULD FORCE YOURS YOU HAVE SEVEN EIGHT MINUTES FROM GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND HEADS UP AND WE WELCOME YOU THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK. GREAT THANK YOU TO ENTER TO BE HERE ON BEHALF. OF MISTER BUT JUST SAY I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH A DISTANCE JOURNEYS TO MY LEFT IS CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF GIVING CONSERVATIVE HICE. TO CLIENT STATES DID THAT THEY'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT AND AND. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE CAUTIOUS IN TERMS OF OVERSTEPPING ITS BOUNDS IN TERMS OF THE DID THIS DECISION HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED. TO THE SPECIAL TAX AREA. THAT SAID. I AGREE WITH THE UPLAND DECISION AND I AGREE WITH IT I'M PREPARED IN TERMS OF ITS BROAD PRINCIPLES I'LL GIVE YOU A JUST A LITTLE ADDITIONAL CONTACTS SO I HAD THE. HONOR OF SORTS OF WORKING ON A COMMENTARY ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND I WILL TAKE SECTIONS ON THIRTEEN EIGHT THIRTEEN B. THIRTEEN C. THIRTEEN D.. ALL THESE VERSIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND WHAT I. WHAT ABOUT THIS THE ISSUE AN OUTLET RIGHT BEFORE I EVEN READ THE UNDERLYING PEEPS AT ALL WELL? OF COURSE THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOVERNED BY THE SAME RULES THE SUPREME COURT HAD JUST IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE IN A CASE CALLED KENNEDY WHOLESALE. DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE INITIATIVE POWER NINETEEN NINETY FIVE I DECIDED IN TERMS. OF THE MISSION OF POWER IN THE CONTEXT OF TAXES. PROP TWO EIGHTEEN IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX SORT OF EMBRACED ONE OF THOSE DECISIONS AND SO FAR AS IT STOOD FOR THE FACT THAT THE VOTERS COULD USE THE INITIATIVE POWER. TO LIMIT TAXES AND THERE'S NO DISCUSSION IN THE BALLOT LANGUAGE AROUND PROP TWO EIGHTEEN IN TERMS OF CONTENIDOS TURN ABOUT THE VOTERS. I'M PUTTING A MEASURES ON THE BALLOT AND SO THE BROAD CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE THAT YOU SHOULD INTERPRET AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE LIKE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN FAVOR OF INITIATIVE POWER WAS HAD BEEN RECENTLY APPLIED. ADVICE OF A CAN OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION SHOULD BE IMPUTED TO THE PEOPLE WHO PASS THE POPOSITION NINETY SIX ADD TO IT REALLY SEEMS A STRAIGHTFORWARD DECISION. THOUGH STRANGE WAY THIS CASE GOT TO THE COURT. IS ADDED TO THE I I HAVE NO COMMENT ABOUT THAT AND I HAVE NO NOTHING CAN HOLD UNDERSTANDING OF DID WHY DID TO THIS PARTICULAR CASE IN THIS IN THIS PROCEDURAL POSTURE. I DO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY. RULE ON SECTION TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE NOT A FOR THAT ONE SPECIAL TAXES THAT'S NOT PROPERTY TO PRACTICE YOU YOU YOU YOU OFFICIAL HOLDING ON THE CASE BEFORE YOU. BUT I THINK THIS AT CISCO CITY ATTORNEY IS CORRECT THAT BASED ON THE BROAD PRINCIPLES THE COURT HAS APPLIED REGULARLY I'M AND NEW TRULY BOTH I'M IN FAVOR OF PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF TAX MEASURES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INITIATIVE POWER. UPLAND WAS CORRECTLY DECIDED AND THAT ONE DAY IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL GO THE NEXT STEP AND FIND. THAT THE SPECIAL TAX RULES ALSO NOT GOVERNED BY I'M A SUPER MAJORITY. THAT IS WHAT I THINK WHAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ACT ON THAT. AT THIS POINT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION RIGHT THAT IS UP TO THE COURTS TO DECIDE ON WHAT. PRISON SHOULD BE I LIKE TO QUICKLY PIVOT TO THE SORT OF BROADER POLICY QUESTION RIGHT SO IF IT'S TRUE. THAT SOMETIME SOON. VOTERS WILL HAVE GREAT LOCAL PHOTOS A LOT GREATER POWER THAN PERHAPS ANTICIPATED ON TO PUT MEASURES ON THE BALLOT ATTACKS WHICH IS ON THE BALLOT HOUSE THE LEGISLATURE APPROACH THAT. AND I THINK THE CONCERNS. THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE LOCAL TAXING POWER WOULD BE USED AND THE LEGISLATURES PROPER ROLE. IS TO CHANNEL THAT POWER RIGHT SO. AND THIS IS GOING GOING TO. MICHAEL KELLY'S POINT AND THEN START THINKING ABOUT THE SORT OF DEER IS A FISCAL FEDERALISM MOST PROBABLY IS THAT. YOU WANT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER ON THE BASIS OF TAX RATES BUT NOT ON THE IS AN OVERLY. A CRUDE INSTRUMENT TO CONTROLLING A LEGITIMATE PROBLEM NAMELY THE CONTROL OF LOCAL TAXATION THERE IS A CONCERN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD USE STANDARDIZED WELL DESIGNED TAX BASES. THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THOSE TAX BASE RATES SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO GET TOO HIGH THERE OTHER CONCERNS ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERHAPS NOT USING THAT METHOD GET WISELY OR BUDGETING PROPERLY BUT THOSE CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA. ON USING THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IN THE THICK MAT SYSTEM IN SCHOOL DISTRICT CONTACT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS A ALREADY A PRETTY GOOD TOOL FOR THE JOB IN TERMS OF CONTROLLING THE REAL PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES. AS WELL AS SOME MODELS IN TERMS OF SALES TAXES HAVE APPROVED ONE BROAD BASED THAT GOVERNMENTS CAN SUPPLEMENT THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO. SPECIAL TAXES AS WELL SO PERHAPS BUT IS THAT YOU COULD SAY IF VOTERS ARE GOING TO USE THIS POWER TO PUT A SPECIAL TAX ON THE BALLOT. THEY SHOULD ONLY THEY CAN ONLY DO SO IF THE TAX STRUCTURE IN THE FOLLOWING UNIFORM SENSIBLE WAY. ON IN TERMS OF APPLICATIONS I WOULD ALSO JUST. REITERATE SOMETHING THAT CAME THROUGH IN THE LA ALL PRESENTATION WHICH IS THAT. COUNTIES AND CITIES CAN READY APPLY GENERAL TAXES WITH A MAJORITY VOTE THEY CAN'T READY DO SO. WITH AN ADVISORY MEASURES TO HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT. IT SEEMS TO ME UNLIKELY THAT I'M NOT A POLITICAL SCIENTIST A POSTER THAT THIS IS THAT GOING TO BE A GIGANTIC GROUND SWELL. OF CITY AND COUNTY. ELECTIONS LIKE THIS GET IT'S POSSIBLE AND IF IT HAPPENS I THINK IN THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CHANNEL AND ORGANIZE THAT ACTIVITY. AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL I DO NOT THINK THOUGH THIS IS SOMETHING HE'S FOR THE RESEARCH THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT ELECTRICALLY CURRENTLY PUT A SPECIAL TAX ON THE BALLOT. IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT COULD. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE IMPORTANT SO RIGHT NOW YOU'RE IN A NOVEL SITUATION WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICT ELECTRIC COULD PUT. UPON MEASURE ON THE BALLOT USING A PROP THIRTY NINE ELECTION COULD PROVE WITH FIFTY FIVE PERCENT MAJORITY SO THEY CAN BUILD A SCHOOL FIFTY FIVE PERCENT MAJORITY BUT THE STAFF TO SCHOOL THEY NEED TO GET A TUTOR TO MATURITY. ON TO PROTECT PASS THE PARCEL TAX. ON IF THE WORLD IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO PERMIT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ELECTORATE TO IMPOSE SPECIAL TAXES AND THE COURTS WERE TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN BY MAJORITY VOTE. THAT COULD INDEED BE SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL IN TERMS OF LOCAL VOTERS RESPONDED TO THAT AND APPROVING INCREASE LOCAL SCHOOL MEASURES BUT AGAIN I WOULD URGE THAT IF THAT HAPPENED THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ACT TO CHANNEL THAT ENTHUSIASM. IN A UNIFORM RATIONAL WAY. WITHOUT COST. TAKE QUESTIONS BECAUSE SO MUCH IS CHANCY WE WELCOME THE VICE CHAIR GOVERNMENT'S FINANCES WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MAJOR WHEN. GOOD TO SEE YOU WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ARE FROM STRANSKY THIS TIME OTHERWISE WE CONSIDER. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR SENATOR WOMEN OR. MEMBERS. ALRIGHT CHANCE HE ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER TURNER-THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE GOVERNMENT WE'RE SAVING THE BEST FOR LAST A BATTING CLEANUP BUT. YOU KNOW SITUATIONS THAT THEY WANT TO OUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A HOT DAY AND WATCH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THE GIANTS ACTUALLY WIN THIS YEAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S FUN AND ONE SPRING TRAINING THIS WEEKEND AND SO I'LL REPORT BACK TO WHAT I SEE. AS LONG AS THEY CAN BE THE DODGERS WERE GOOD EXACTLY THAT'S THE WAY THEY'RE. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CONSIDER WITH THIS. YOU KNOW. I GUESS EXCEPT TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE SO FAR IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE CASE SAYS I THINK THAT? YOU KNOW FOR QUESTION HERE IS. WHAT THE CITY OF A CASE AND SAVE UP AND SAYS? THE COURTS AS THREE TIMES WE CONCLUDE THAT. WITH RESPECT TO ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE SECTION TO BE WHICH IS JUST ABOUT TO. A GENERAL TAX BASED ON THE GENERAL SHIN BALLOT. BUT THE TERM LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES INCLUDE A INITIATIVES. LOCAL VOTER INITIATIVES. I THINK THAT UNDERSTANDING. OF THE REST OF THE LANGUAGE THIS USED BY THE COURT IN CONTEXT REQUIRES. TO LOOK AT THAT CASE. OUTSIDE THE VACUUM IF YOU WILL AND AND AND WHAT I WROTE FOR THE COMMITTEE. IS A COMMENTARY NOT SO MUCH AS LEGAL ADVICE CERTAINLY BUT. IS COMMENTARY ON THE COURT'S OPINION BECAUSE I GREW THE LEGAL ADVICE SAID IT RIGHT NOW ALL WE KNOW. SPECIFICALLY IS THAT THE COURT HAS DECIDED THAT ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE SECTION TO BE. DOES APPLY TO VOTER INITIATIVES. BUT THERE IS ON ON UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THE COURT DRAFTED THAT OPINION. THEY RAISE MORE QUESTIONS AND THE ANSWER AND SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THAT CASE AND AND AND MY PAPER AND WHEN I WROTE THE COMMITTEE. YOU SORT OF GET IT. UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU BRING WITH YOU TO ADD TO THAT DISCUSSION. ME PERSONALLY A LITTLE OF MY BACKGROUND I'VE BEEN SINGLE TAX FOR FOR TWENTY YEARS FOR SURE AND AN INSIDE OUTSIDE WE TAX OTHER THAN A PROPERTY TAX YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THIS CONCEPT OF. SOME OF THE ATTACKS SPENT ON A SPECIFIC PURPOSE AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS YOU SEE. UP YOU KNOW PROP THIRTEEN AND WE HAVE RICHMOND THEN WE HAVE FERAL ADEN NARROWING THE CONSTRUCTION OF WHAT PROP THIRTEEN MOTOR LIMITATIONS. ONTAXES STOOD FOR. THAN WE HAD PROP SIXTY TWO WHEN THE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT REGARDING WHETHER BEING A STATUTORY MISSION OF. WHETHER APPLIED TO CHARTER CITIES ARMS CONSTITUTIONALITY AND WE HAD. KNOCKS FOR CITY FOR AWHILE ORLAND THEN WE HAD PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AM HAD SINCLAIR PAINT. THIRTY SEVEN AND WE HAD THE DISCARDED THE BACK AND FORTH AND LEGISLATURE IN THE. MID TWO THOUSANDS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD PASS A. MAJORITY VOTE BILL. THAT ESSENTIALLY SHIFTED TAXES AMONGST TAXPAYERS ON THE WE HAD BROUGHT TWENTY SIX IMAGE MIR. ON THAT SORT OF BACK AND FORTH A DYNAMIC AFTER I THINK YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WHEN A TAXPAYER AT LEAST AND THAT'S BEEN MY PROOF MIGHT. PRACTICES WHAT BEEN. OBSCENE TAXPAYERS LOOKING AT THIS CASE. I SO WHY CAN'T WHY PURCHASE CASE I I UNDERSTOOD THAT HISTORY THAT CONTEXT OF THE SORT OF BACK AND FORTH I YOU WILL BETWEEN. TAXPAYERS AND. THE COURTS WIN IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. HONESTLY TRYING TO SIT ON A DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT. IS SPECIFIC DOES WHAT IT WANTS DOES WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WOULD NOT BE SO BROAD. AND. BUT SAME TIME THEN SURVIVE THE ARTFUL CONSTRUCTION OF THE COURTS AND THAT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE I THINK FOR TAXPAYERS ARE LAST THREE YEARS. TO BRING THAT SORT OF HISTORY IN THAT THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT READING CITY OF UP ON THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME ABOUT IT WAS THE COURT MISSED ALL THE EXIT SIGNS. IT WAS MOVED WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CASE ITSELF WAS MOVED. BUT THE QUESTION REALLY BEFORE THE COURT WASN'T ABOUT WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE QUESTION FOR THE COURT WAS WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY. WAS IN ITS RIGHTS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE PROPOSED CHARGE WAS ATTACKS HER FEET WAS LABELED A FEE. AND THE COURT MAKE IN THIS CASE SAYS. IT WASN'T THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CITY TO DO TO. ORDAIN THAT THAT WAS A TAX AND THEREBY PUT IT ON. THE GENERAL BALLOT PURSUANT TO THE CONSTITUTION. YOU COULD EVEN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY. WAS BOUND BY THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS PUT ON SPECIAL ACTIONS PUTS THE GENERAL ELECTION. BUT THE CORDON STATUS WHILE AND THEY DECIDE TO GO TO THIS LARGER QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THE DEFINITION LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEANS. AND THEN WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE A QUESTION THEY REFUSED TO ANSWER THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THEY REFUSED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT DECISION. IN SO WHEN IT WHEN THEIR THEIR POSTS I THINK WITH PROBABLY THE EASIEST QUESTION WHICH WAS. ASSUMING THAT A LOCAL VOTER INITIATIVE GROUP A LOCAL WATER GROUP PROPOSED INITIATIVE. TO WHICH I I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY AN EASY CASE OCCURRED OF SIMPLY SAID WILL OF COURSE HAVE TO PUT ON THE ON THE ON TH BALLOT BECAUSE IT'S A VOTER INITIATIVE IT'S THE NATURE OF THE PROCESS. THEY DIDN'T ASK THE MORE DIFFICULT QUESTION WHICH WAS IF LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEANS WHAT THEY HAVE DETERMINED AT WHAT THEY HAVE SAID IT MEANS IN THE CONTEXT OF. THIS QUESTION WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR ARTICLE THIRTEEN C. AND D. GENERALLY OR MORE SPECIFICALLY THE DEFINITION OF TAX VERSUS FEE THEY DIDN'T ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS AND SO. YOU KNOW AS A AS A TEXTURE REASON OF LIGHT I. I I I KIM'S CASES ARE ASKING ALL THOSE QUESTIONS SO WHAT IS IT THAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE LAYING A FOUNDATION THAT SEEMS TO ME WHAT. I READ THE CASES IN IN TERMS OF COMMENTARY NOT ME PROVIDING ADVICE TO MY CLIENT BUT. IN TERMS OF MY CONJURE WITH THIS CASE STANDS FOR THE FOUNDATION. AND I THINK THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OPINION IN SERVICES GO. REFLECTS THAT IT'S BEEN HIS OPINION VERY LIKELY AND THAT MEMOS DIRECTLY TO HIS ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. IS VERY LIKELY IN HIS OPINION THAT THE COURT WHEN PRESENTED WITH THE PROPER FACTS. IS GOING TO ELIMINATE THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO. THIRTEEN C. THIRTEEN D. AND AND ARGUABLY ON THIRTEEN A SECTION FOR AS WELL WHICH IT WAS IT TO ME IS IT RAISES A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE. IN CITY OF UPLAND. PROFESSOR CHANCE HE MENTIONS A CANDY WHOLESALE THREE KENNEDY WHOLESALE THE CORE ALTHOUGH THE COURT SAID THE INITIATIVE THE LIMITATIONS ON THE LEGISLATURE RESPECT TO. THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR PASSING TAXES DIDN'T APPLY TO VOTER INITIATIVES. THE COURT IN CANADA WHOLESALE ACTUALLY LOOK TO SECTION FOUR WHICH IS THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT ON. ON CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. ARM AS. RATIONALE FOR WHY. THE. TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT A LEGISLATURE DIDN'T APPLY TO. VOTER INITIATIVE IN THE IN THE COURT SETTING KENNY ALSO IS BECAUSE THE VOTERS UNDERSTOOD. THAT IF THEY WANTED TO PLACE A LIMIT PON THEMSELVES THEY COULD DO THAT AND THEY POINTED SECTION FOUR. BUT EXPLICITLY AND THERE'S A COURT OF APPEAL. DECISION OUT THERE. COLD ALTADENA LIBRARY JUST RECESS ESSENTIALLY THAT THAT THAT. THAT A VOTER INITIATIVE IS SUBSTITUTED A REQUIREMENT OF SECTION FOUR. AND THE COURT DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT QUESTION AT ALL WHICH IS THE SORT OF LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE I THINK OF. OF THEIR OPINION SO I THINK THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY I THINK I THINK IS A AMABLE JOB OF. SOME OF OF RECOGNIZING THAT THAT'S THE NEXT STOP SO I RECIEVE UPLAND I'M I I I THINK OF ANOTHER TAX CASE IT'S OUT THERE YOU MIGHT BE AWARE OF. IT WAS HE REMINDS ME OF A CASE THAT IF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CALLED A AN IDEA MAY VERSUS BOWL IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING V.. THE NATIONAL DEBATE OVER THE REMOTE COLLECTION OF SALES AND USE TAX BY STATES FROM REMOTE SELLERS. VERSES BRAWL WAS AND TEXAN JUNCTION AXES YOU CAN'T CHALLENGE ATTACKS WITHOUT PAYING THE TAX UPON CLAIM FOR REFUND AS WE HAVE THE SAME VISION OUR CONSTITUTION. AND SO THAT QUESTION ONE UP TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND THREE QUARTERS REMANDED IT SAID NO THIS IS ABOUT THE TAX INJUNCTION I CAN JUST KENNEDY SAID. IN A CONCURRING OPINION. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE REVISIT QUILL AND I'M PARAPHRASING OF COURSE BUT. HE. ISSUED BY A CONCURRING OPINION SAID TECHNOLOGIES TEENS INVITE THE ECONOMY CHANGED AND QUILL WAS SORT OF A QUESTIONABLE DECISION QUILL HAS A PHYSICAL PRESENCE REQUIREMENT FOR STATES TO IMPOSE A REMOTE COLLECTION OBLIGATION. TO CLOSE OUR TAX I'M SORRY THANK YOU. AND SO. KENNEDY INVITED ESSENTIALLY. I THINK A GOOD OVERTLY INVITED. CHALLENGED QUILL AND SO WE HAVE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BEING HEARD ANOTHER MONTH BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN THAT WAY FOR SOUTH DAKOTA. AND SO IS SOUTH DAKOTA TOOK UP THE CHALLENGE BY PASSING A A STATUTE WHICH DIRECTLY CHALLENGE OF HIS PRESENCE REQUIREMENT AND I YOU KNOW I THINK. BRAUNTON PURPOSES THERE'S. A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE COURT WILL OVERTURN QUILT ON BY BY JUNE THIS YEAR I ANSWER LOOK AT THIS CASE IN THAT CONTEXT. THE COURT DIDN'T HAVE THE FACTS BEFORE THEM. TOO FAIRLY ADDRESS THE LARGER QUESTION OF WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEANS IN THE CONTEXT OF ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE AN ARTICLE THIRTEEN D. GLOBALLY. BUT THEY CLEARLY LAID OUT ALL THE ARGUMENTS FOR DOING SO AND SO FROM A TAX PERSPECTIVE AND LOOKING AT THE CITY OF. SERVICES GOES SEE TREES OPINION. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT EXPECT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND TREATED AS IF IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED AND I'M SURE THAT THERE. ARE ALREADY. MORE THAN A COUPLE GROUPS THAT ARE DRAFTING INITIATIVES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT NOW. TO TEST THIS VERY QUESTION. AND SO WITH THAT HOLLYWOOD FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS TO TURN TO OUR ENTIRE PANEL AGREED FOR THE YOU'RE ALL HERE TODAY TO BE A PROVIDER EXPERTISE. BUT WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO IS OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE THEN WE OF COURSE WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. UP BUT WE LIKE TO BE TO START O SEE IF ANY THE CHAIRWOMAN I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THEY'D LIKE TO. ADVANCE THIS TIME. IT WILL GET THE MESSAGE. I THINK HE'S MATURE WOMAN IF IT WORKS FOR THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GO TO THE VICE CHAIR OF GOVERNANCE AND BOTH THE STATE AND THE LOCAL LEVEL. FOR MORE TAX INCREASES SO MIGHT MY CONCERN AS A RESULT OF THE CORT'S DECISION. IS THAT WE WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN LOCAL VOTER INITIATIVES. THAT'S OPPOSE RAISING SPECIAL TAXES REQUIRE ONLY SIMPLE MAJORITY. TO PROVE THEM SO. YOU KNOW TWO MONTHS AGO AFTER THE UPLAND DECISION THE CENSUS OF CITTERN IS TELLING. THE CITY DIRECTOR OF LACK OF ELECTIONS THAT SPECIAL EDITION OF OPPOSED BY INTEREST GROUPS MAY NOW BE SUBJECT ONLY TO MAJORITY VOTE. SO THAT'S VERY CONCERNING FOR ME IS ONE IS THE INCONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE. AND GIVEN THAT WE HAD PROP THIRTEEN AND ALL THESE OTHER DISHES. ON. IF WE ARE SETTING THE STAGE FOR WIDESPREAD TAX INCREASES. BY INITIATIVE. THROUGH A SIMPLE MAJORITY. ARE THERE ANY TRUE LIMITS. TO POTENTIALLY. TO A POTENTIAL TAX PROPOSALS THAT CAN BE PUT BEFORE THE VOTERS THAT THEY MEAN. IN IN CALIFORNIA TO TO STOP. THE INCONSISTENCY OF ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND DIFFERENT MEDIA SPECIAL IT I MEAN. YOU'VE GOT LOCALLY. SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU GOT. YOU KNOW SPECIAL DISTRICTS YOU'VE GOT CITY YOU'VE GOT COUNTY YOU'VE GOT COLLEGE DISTRICTS WE'VE GOT EVERYBODY ANYBODY IT'S NOT JUST. THE CITY OR THE COUNTY. YEAH YOU THIS WHOLE. A LOT OF WAYS I GUESS I COULD ANSWER THAT ARM I THINK EACH ONE OF THOSE ENTITIES HAVE. DIFFERENT INHERENT TAXING AUTHORITY VERSES WHAT. THEY ARE PROVIDED IN TERMS OF TAXING AUTHORITY. THROUGH LEGISLATIVE ACTS SO SCOPE OF WHAT THEY CAN DO IS SOMEWHAT. RESTRICTED BY STATUTE. BUT BUT THAT SAID I GUESS THE THE PART THAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT THAT I WORRY ABOUT WE WERE ACTUALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS FASTER MY. BEFORE IS THAT THE IDEA OF THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT IS. IS IS IN IN SOME SENSE EIGHT PROTECTION OF OF OF GROUPS OF MINORITY GROUPS OR INSULAR GROUPS. AND WE'VE HAD A KIND OF HISTORY LAST I THINK TEN OR TWENTY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA OF. OF TARGETING PARTICULAR GROUPS RENSSELAER TAXATION IT'S A WAY OF FUNDING. SOMETIMES BROAD POPULAR PROGRAMS BUT WE TARGET UNPOPULAR GROUPS AND THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT THINK PROTECTS AGAINST THAT TO SOME DEGREE AND I THINK. YOU ELIMINATION OF THAT PROTECTION IS GOING YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ESPECIALLY WHEN SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE INVOLVED. AND THE HOUSE. A LESS THAN THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF THAT THEY'RE REPRESENTING WHICH IS THE YOU KNOW YOU COULD ARGUE THAT CITY COUNCIL OR THE COUNTY THE RIBS OF THE WHOLE COUNTY RIGHT SO THEY HAVE THE TAKING COMPETING INTERESTS WHEREAS. NOW WE'RE SETTING UP A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE A SPECIAL INTEREST MIGHT. HAVE HAD A DESIRE FOR SPENDING BUT THEY DON'T REALLY SO MUCH ONE TAX THEMSELVES SO THEIR TARGET SOMEBODY ELSE YOU KNOW IT WAS THE ISFIELD SAW. A DON'T TAX YOU DON'T TAX ME TAX THE FOLLOWING TO THE TREE AND THAT'S BEEN A POLICY IN CALIFORNIA OUT FRANKLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE LASTED TEN TWENTY YEARS AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT RATCHET UP IF THIS. IF THE COURT TAKES UP THE CHALLENGE AND AND ULTIMATELY SAYS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I'M SORRY LOCAL FURNISHES ARE SUPPOSED TO THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT YOU SEE THAT TARGETING BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO KATE OLD YOU KNOW ON. VOTERS INITIATIVE OF LOCAL TAX INITIATIVE WITH THAT IT COULD I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT'S THE HISTORY I MEAN I HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN PROP TWENTY SIX THAT'S WHAT ITS PURPOSE WAS PART TWENTY SIX DID TO YOU. REALLY THREE THINGS THAT. ADDRESS THE SINCLAIR PAIN DECISION IT ADDRESSED THE THE AMBIGUITY N. ARTICLE THIRTEEN IS SECTION THREE AS TO WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE COULD PASS. EIGHT ATTACKS THAT WAS OSTENSIBLY REVENUE NEUTRAL BUT SHIFTED OBLIGATIONS AMONGST GROUPS. ARM AND THEN IT SHIFTED THE BURDEN PROOF FOR FOR DEFENDING A SUIT CHALLENGING WHETHER A A NEW POSITIONS ATTACKS HER FEET. BUT CRITICS WAS SPECIFICALLY AN ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS AND AND I SUSPECT THERE WILL BE AN ANSWER TO THIS AS WELL. THANK YOU. TO COME IN APART FROM ANY LEGAL IMITATION THERE ARE TWO PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY TO RAISE REVENUE FOR GOVERNMENT ONE IS EVERYTHING REQUIRES VOTER APPROVAL AND EVEN A FIFTY PERCENT STANDARD IS NOT AN EASY SELL BECAUSE VOTERS UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THEIR POCKET BOOK ABOUT LIKE IT TO STAY. THERE. AND SECONDLY THERE ARE ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE REALITIES YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REASONABLY EFFICIENT WAY TO TAX IT BUT I'LL CHASING IT OUT OF YOUR COMMUNITY. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE STATE SALES TAX AND WE HAVE TO RELY ON THE STATE TO OPERATE THAT TAX. MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A BUSINESS LICENSE TAX AND SET UP AN ENGINE TO DO IT AND UTILITY TAXES RELY ON THE UTILITY COMPANIES BUT WHEN YOU START TO THINK MORE. MORE BROADLY IT'S HARD YOU HAD TO SET UP A WHOLE ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM IN EACH OF THE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA IN FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN ORDER TO CHASE WHAT MIGHT BE AND ITS REVENUE. SO PRACTICALLY THE ECONOMY AND THE ECONOMICS OF TAXATION LIMIT OUR CHOICES. BECAUSE WHAT YOU AS A COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN OF THAT QUICKLY. SHUTS. WHICH I CAN WHICH GOES TO WHY IF. THIS WERE TO BE A. IF WE WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN OR AT LEAST IT DID HAPPEN HERE THE REASON TO PROVIDE STANDARDIZED BASIS AND SO IN ORDER AND CAPTAIN MILLER CHURCH. AROUND THIS PROBLEM IN TERMS OF THAT I WOULD TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE TWO THE TWO THIRDS RULE AND. RECENT HISTORY OF TAXATION IN CALIFORNIA IT IS TRUE THAT THERE'S NOW BEEN BALLOT BOX BUDGIE WHERE PEOPLE ARE THERE NOW THINGS ON THE BUDGET THAT'S EVER GOING TO RAISE THE SPECIFIC TAXES FOR THE SPECIFIC. PROJECT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT RIGHT. THERE ARE POST PROP THIRTEEN PHENOMENON RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T DO TAX POLICY BECAUSE OF THE TWO THIRDS RULES. YOU NOW HAVE BALLOT BOX BUDGETING NOW I'M NOT AS DOW. I'M NOT THE DIRECTOR'S. IT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION BUT IT'S WORTH UNDERSTANDING BOTH SIDES OF IT RIGHT AND AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A SPECIAL RULE MAKE IT VERY HARD TO RAISE TAXES. IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A RULE LIKE THAT AND I THINK THAT AGAIN THERE'S SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ABSOLUTE FIRST GOT PAST TO BE. BEFORE YOU LOCK THE DOOR MAKE SURE THE TAXES DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE IS BROAD STABLE AND WELL DESIGNED. AND THE ISSUE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE. COULD LOCK THE DOOR WHEN THE SYSTEM WAS UNSTABLE AND POORLY DESIGNED AND THAT'S THE SITUATION WE'RE IN NOW BUT WE HAVE A HARD TIME CHANGING. A SYSTEM THAT'S NOT WELL DESIGNED AND. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO CHANGE IT WHILE ALSO TAKING DUMB TO MEASURE UP THE CONCERNS OF UP UP AN ARTICLE TO BE PROTECTED. THANK YOU MISSILE. I JUST ECHO MICHAEL'S COMMENT THAT IN A MAJORITY OF HER APPROVAL IS NOT A SIMPLE THINGS SO EVEN IF IT IS FOR SPECIAL SPECIAL PURPOSE. IS INITIATED BY VOTERS THEY STOPPED ME THAT THRESHOLD. AND ULTIMATELY IT IS THE VOTERS CHOICE IF THEY WANT TO WANT TO HOW THE TAX WITHOUT THEY WON'T BE TAXED. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IF IT WORKS FOR THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO BE A GOOD LISTENER MORLOCK WITH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. THEY CAN ATTAIN DISCUSSING MARLA. SURE IT'S NICE TO HAVE BB K. IN THE ROOM. AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF BEING INVOLVED IN COUNTY GOVERNMENT TO BRING INTO YOUR FIRM TWENTY. ON MANY OF THE BORG COMMITMENTS AND MICHAEL I THINK WE GO BACK TO THE ORANGE COUNTY VECTOR CONTROL DISTRICTS OF. FOLK. WE'VE HAD GOOD DEBATES ON THE PARTIAL TAX IN ITS VALIDITY I THINK I WAS. IN THE MINORITY VIEW BUT WE STILL HAD FUN. DEBATING. I AM. I I AM JUST CURIOUS HOW OFTEN DOES A GROUP OF CITIZENS CIRCULATE A PETITION TO TRY AND RAISE A LOCAL TAX. I HAVE NOT OFTEN SEEN IT YEAH BUT I'M NOW SEEING IT. SO IT'S GONNA BE A NEW TOOL INSTEAD OF HAVING THE CITY COUNCIL PUT IT ON THE BALLOT. BUILD. BECAUSE YOU COMMISSION A GROUP YOU CAN CONTROL THE DAY. SO AND THEN YOU CAN GET FIFTY PERCENT THRESHOLD. I'M ON IT WE WE HAVEN'T I HAVE NOT ADVISING MY CLIENTS THAT THE INITIATIVE PROCESS CHANGES THE VOTE STANDARD BUT WHAT DOES CHANGE AND AND YOU KNOW IN POLITICS IT MATTERS WHAT DAY YOU'RE PUTTING THE BALLOT ON IT GIVES YOU CONTROL OVER THE ELECTION DATE. THERE WAS THE BALLOT BOX BUDGETING EVERYTHING THINK CITIES AND COUNTIES ALL THEY'VE GOT LEFT IS MAYBE TO RAISE THE SALES TAX AND. SO YOU SEE THAT'S THAT THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LEVELED. AND THE SALES TAX IS CAPPED AT TWO PERCENT. OF ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON TOP OF THE STATE TAX. ON THAT TAXES HAVE A VESTED INDUSTRY OUT THERE THAT WILL PROTECT THEIR TURF ON BUSINESS LICENSE TAXES. ARE COMPLEX A MEDICAL MARIJUANA MARIJUANA TAXES OF THE FLAVOR OF THE MONTH. BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO DISCOVER THAT THE INDUSTRY IS OVERTAXED. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE. PRODUCT PRICE FALLS TO THE FLOOR LIKE IT DID IN EVERY OTHER LEGALIZATION STATE. AND I JUST ADD THAT. MY OFFICE IS IS IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. I'VE SPENT SEVENTEEN HAVE YEARS OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO BEFORE I CAME TO BEST PASSING KRIEGER. AND SO I WAS INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CHARGERS BACK IN MY DAY OKAY. A FAMILIAR WITH THEIR THEIR ATTEMPT TO GET A NEW STADIUM BUILT IN SAN DIEGO AND THEIR ACTIVITY INVOLVED IN THIS LITIGATION. THERE ARE BUT A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES IN SAN DIEGO THAT HAPPENED DRIVEN IN PART BY SPECIAL INTERESTS SUCH AS THE TOURISM GROUP IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET THE SPECIAL THE CONVENTION CENTER THINGS OF THAT NATURE. BUT ONE OF THEM EVER TRY TO GET AROUND THE TWO THIRDS VOTE APPROVAL REQUIREMENT. AND THOUGH SO THOSE INITIATIVES A BIT MORE ABOUT. ARE THE VOTERS CAN APPROVE THE THE PARTICULAR FACILITIES ARE PROJECTS AS OPPOSED TO. ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A TAX IMPOSED UPON INDIVIDUALS TO PAY FOR THAT EXPANSION. OTHER THAN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXPENSE OF THE CONVENTION CENTER WHICH WAS GOING TO BE A TWO THIRDS VOTE APPROVAL. I'M NOT TOO RECENT SNEAKILY HABITAT DEAN'S TINA BENNIS SPANOS IS NOW ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN. HIS OFFICE IS JUST DOWN THE STREET ALLIANCE OVER. THE CHARGERS. MICHAEL YOU'RE TRYING NOT TO GIVE ME THE DETAILS OF WHAT CASES ARE TAKEN BY THE STATE SUPREME COURT. EXCEPT MAYBE ALL FOUR OF YOU. WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR CASE IS THAT AFTER YOU WENT THROUGH THE APPELLATE COURT LEVEL YOU WANTED TO GO TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR CASES WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT? I'VE HAD REMARKABLE SUCCESS IN GETTING THE ATTENTION OF THE SUPREME COURT I'VE HAD ELEVEN CASES SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR. ON THE REASON FOR THAT I THINK IS THAT I'M IN A SUBJECT AREA THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THE COURT AND WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF FERMENT IN THE LAW. WHICH IS THE REVENUE SIDE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE SO I ARGUE TWO CASES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I'VE GOT A CASE COMING ON FOR ARGUMENT SHORTLY AND I HAVE TWO PETITIONS PENDING AT THE MOMENT. TOOK A HUNDRED PERCENT RATE NO BUT SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY FIFTY WHICH IS NOT BAD WHEN THE GENERAL AVERAGE IS TWO PERCENT. OKAY. GREG YOU HAVE PRESSED THE PANEL. I'VE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A CASE ALL WOULD SCREAM COURT BECAUSE I WANT TO JUST SPEND A LITTLE TIME. ON THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT YOU'RE BEEN COMMENTING ON HIS STICK. SCHOLARSHIP OF THIS. OPINION. AND SO I'VE HAD MY EXPERIENCES AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT WITH PRETTY SERIOUS LAWSUITS. ON THE RETIREMENT BOARD FOR AND KENNY WE HAD BEEN SURE CASE WHICH JUST. WAS AN AMAZING SIGHT TO BEHOLD IN. VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ALL COUNTY THIRTY SEVEN AT COUNTIES. ARE WE HAD. OF THE R. RECAPTURE CASE WHERE WE HAD SOMEONE IN SEAL BEACH WAS TRYING TO REDO PROP. THIRTEEN IN A VERY INTERESTING EXPERIENCE IT WAS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE SUPREME COURT. I I HAD MY RETROACTIVITY CASE. WHICH WAS A MAJOR. CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN IT ACTUALLY I'VE I'VE FELT THAT GRANTING RETRACTED. PENSION BENEFITS BROKE TO CODE THAT ARTICLE SECTIONS IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION SO I WAS HOPING FOR REAL SCHOLARSHIP. IT'S A GREAT NOW WE'RE GONNA GET THE SEVEN PEOPLE THIS DOES BRING TRUST THAT TO COMMENT. BUT. THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE CASE AND SO NOW I. SORT OF LIVE WITH THE BITTERNESS OF REALIZING THAT MAYBE ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT HAVE BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS FOR THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT THAT WE. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT ANYWAY. I'M JUST REALLY CURIOUS WOULD YOU COMMENT ON THE SCHOLARSHIP YOU KIND OF SAID IT DIDN'T GO THROUGH. SECTION SEE ANDY AND THEY DIDN'T ADDRESS. SIGH I DO WE HAVE. DO WE HAVE FOR YOU USE THE TERM. A LAYING THE FOUNDATION. AND I'M WONDERING OVER THEIR HEADS. SO I WANNA CONFIDENCE LEVEL OR DO WE HAVE. A SUPREME COURT THAT'S DOING A GOOD JOB BY THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. WELL AT LEAST. ANOTHER CAN HAVE A LARGER COMMENTARY ON THE ON THE SUPREME COURT GENERALLY I WOULD SAY FROM THE TAXPAYERS PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW OVER MY CAREER IT'S CERTAINLY. THE PASSAGE OF PROP THIRTEEN. IN A ROW IT'S MY OPINION THAT IT IT THERE'S BEEN A STRUGGLE WITH TRYING FEELING LIKE. AS A AS A DRAFTER AND AS A TAXPAYER THAT YOU WERE NOT QUITE GETTING THE LANGUAGE. INITIATIVES. TIGHT ENOUGH FOR SKILLED LAWYERS TO. GET AROUND. AND IN THAT GOES BACK YOU COULD GO BACK TO. JUSTICE MOSS OPINION IN RICHMOND BACK IN EIGHTY TWO WHERE YOU KNOW HIS YEAH AFTER AM OR AM OR DECIDED THE. PROP THIRTEEN AND APPLIED A VERY BROAD STANDARD FRANKLY TO IT THAT THEY WERE TO GET TO GRANT. A SORT OF A GENERAL CONSTRUCTION OF A VERY BROAD CONSTRUCTION TO THE. INTENT OF THE VOTERS IN APPLYING THE LANGUAGE PROP THIRTEEN AND THEN WHICH BECAME ALONG AND AND A JUSTICE MOSS SAID. THAT HIS VIEW OF THE TWO THERE'S A REQUIREMENT IS UNDEMOCRATIC. AND I THINK THAT THAT TAINTS. ANY LOOK AT. THE EFFORT TO PLACE A LIMIT ON THE TAXING AUTHORITY AND I THINK THAT THAT. THAT VIEW HAS PERMEATED SUBSEQUENT SUPREME COURT DECISIONS BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN THIS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN. THE WEATHER'S PROP SIXTY TWO A PROP TO EIGHTEEN OR PROP TWENTY SIX THEIR THEIR ANSWERS TO SOMETHING THEY WEREN'T DRAFTED EVEN PROP THIRTEEN SO WASN'T IN A VACUUM IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO. ACTIVITIES IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES PROPERTY TAXES SO. I GUESS IN I'M LOOKING AT THIS OPINION. I CAN'T SAY IT'S AN INDICTMENT OF THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF. IT IS THIS OPINION I DON'T THINK IT'S I THINK THAT THEY. TRUE OF THE IMAGE. DRAFTED A FOUNDATION FOR SUBSEQUENT. QUESTION. OF THAT THEY'RE DISSIPATING COMING. AND. I DON'T KNOW THISOF A BROADER STATEMENT ON THE COURT ITSELF WHICH IS THAT THIS OPINION. BUT I JUST THINK RAISES. MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT NEEDED TO ANSWER AND THAT TO ME IT RAISES QUESTIONS THIS ISN'T WHAT'S NEXT. A COUPLE REACTIONS THE QUESTION IF I MAY ONE IS THAT THE COURT DOES EVENTUALLY THAT IT SOMETIMES IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE POSITION ON AN ISSUE FOR THE COURT TO TAKE IT. AND THE QUESTIONS YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THEY DIDN'T TAKE UP WHEN YOU WERE STILL ACCOUNTING OFFICE ARE NOW BEFORE THE COURT IN THE ALAMEDA AND MARINE CASES. SO THEY GOT THERE AND TOOK THEM LONGER HAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED ON AND THEY WERE COSTS THAT WERE INCURRED ALONG THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO AVOID IT BUT THEY DID GET THERE. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT THE COURT. IS THAT WE'VE HAD A MODERATELY CONSERVATIVE COURTS INSTITUTE MEIJIN MINISTRATION SINCE THE RECALL. AND WE NOW HAVE THREE YOUNG DEMOCRATIC APPOINTED JUSTICES WHO ARE ALL VERY BRIGHT YELLOW GRADS WHO DID NOT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE IN THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIA OR WAS THE FEDERAL SYSTEM INTO THEIR ASKING QUESTIONS THAT HAVE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ASKED BY OTHERS AND THE COURT IS VERY MUCH IN A TIME OF CHANGE. ON THE FOURTH APPOINTMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR AND. PERHAPS WE'LL HAVE A FIFTH ON DEPENDING ON HOW THE. CONSERVATIVES ON THE COURT VIEW THE RESULTS OF THE JUNE PRIMARY IN THE COMMUNITY ELECTION I'M GONNA MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO THIS COURT. AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN CHANGE UNTIL IT REACHES SOME STABILITY AND THAT STABILITY MAY BE A FEW YEARS AWAY SO THIS IS A VERY. FERTILE TIME. AND THE CHANGE WILL BE ON WELCOME TO THOSE WHO APPRECIATED A MODERATELY CONSERVATIVE COURT FOR TWO GENERATIONS. SINCE YOU CAN'T CONCEIVE MISS HOLT HAS ITEMS USED TO BE A CHINAMAN'S CHANCE CAME IN. I'M. A COUPLE THINGS ONE THING INTERESTINGLY THE BROWN APPOINTEES SPLIT ON THIS DECISION RIGHTIST DECISION WAS WRITTEN BY JUSTICE QUAI ARE. BUT JUSTICES KRUEGER LOU I'M DESCENDED SO THIS IS AN ACT SO IN SO FAR AS TO YOU KNOW I AM. DON'T WANT TO. EOD BE OVERLY CRASS IN TERMS OF THE COURT I THINK THAT COURTS GENERALLY REACH UNANIMOUS DECISIONS NOT BASED ON POLITICAL. PARTY THOUGH SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S REALLY NOT TRUE I'M AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT AND THEN SECONDLY. THE COURT REACHED A NARROW DECISIONS. HATED WHICH OUT THIS OTHER DECISION ABOUT TAXES SPECIFICALLY RESERVED IT AGAIN THEY HAD IT IS SUGGESTIVE BUT IT BUT IT COULD HAVE REACHED OUT TO THAT QUESTION IT IS A SUPREME COURT IT AS. IT DID NOT AND IN ADDITIONALLY I'M IT IS FAIRLY GROUNDED IN BROAD CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THAT HAD BEEN APPLIED JUST THE YEAR BEFORE PROP TWO EIGHTEEN I'M IN FAVOR OF OF. PEOPLE WHO ARE. CONCERNED WITH I'M LIMITING TAXES SO PROPONENTS OF. AN INITIATIVE TO OUR PROSPECTIVELY REPEAL ATTACKS THE QUESTION WAS CAN YOU DO THAT USED INITIATIVE POWER TO REPEAL ATTACKED THE SUPREME COURT SAID WELL. WE INTERPRET INITIATIVE POWER PROBABLY IT SO YOU CAN AND SO IT IS A BROAD NEUTRAL PRINCIPLE THAT OBVIOUSLY IS GROUNDS IN CALIFORNIA LAW THAT THE JUSTICES APPLIED AND THEY DIDN'T APPLIED IN LOCKSTEP BY TERMS OF ANY SORT OF IDEOLOGICAL LITMUS TEST SO I THINK. AS FAR AS DISTINCT CASES CONCERNED ONE CAN HAVE LEGITIMATE DISAGREEMENTS BUT I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT EIGHTY IS. YOU KNOW OPT OUT. EIGHT ON REASONABLE DECISION BY ANY MEANS THANK YOU SO. I WOULD ECHO WHAT WHAT WAS THE FIRST CHANCE HE SAID. BUT ALSO ADD THE LARGE PART WE'RE WE'RE STUCK WITH A BALLOT INITIATIVE WHICH QUITE FRANKLY WAS POORLY DRAFTED FROM THE CASCO. AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WORKING ON ON PROP TWO EIGHTEEN ISSUES CINCINNATI WHEN IN NINETEEN SO ULTIMATELY I YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE AN END TO THIS LITIGATION AND WE HAVE NOT ONLY THE. ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE HERE BUT THIRTEEN D. WHICH CONTINUES TO BE THE ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS THE RELATIONSHIP TO PROP PROPERLY FEES AND CHARGES IN ASSESSMENTS. SO YOU KNOW I DON'T BLAME THE CORE FOR NOT GOING THERE NO. ULTIMATELY I I I THINK THEY DECIDED TO FOCUS. ON THE SPECIFIC QUESTION AT HAND. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID IT WHETHER IT HAS IMPLICATIONS EXTEND BEYOND THAT. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY SAW THAT AS THEIR ROLE IN THAT PARTICULAR DECISION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR I CAN INNOCENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE PANEL THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER. LET ME SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO CHIME IN UP PRIOR TO GOING TO PUBLIC COMMENT. ALL RIGHT TO ASK THE PANEL TO HANG WITH US JUST IN CASE YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT. NOW WOULD LIKE TO BUILD OPEN IT UP FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND PLEASE QUEUING UP BEHIND THE MICROPHONE RIGHT UP HERE. YOU DON'T MIND SITTING YOUR FIRST AND AST IN THE ORGANIZATION OF TWO MINUTES WE WELCOME YOU SIR AND THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. MORNING MEMBERS. IF THE MICRON IS IT IS HER I I'M TIM BIDDLE FROM THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. I REPRESENTED THE CITY OF UPLAND IN THE OPEN CASE. AS MENTIONED AT THE START THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MEDIA CHATTER ABOUT THE UPLAND DECISION SUPPOSEDLY HOLDING THAT SPECIAL TAX AS PROPOSED BY. INITIATIVE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO A TWO THIRDS VOTE. REQUIREMENT ANYMORE I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THREE REASONS. FROM THE OPINION ITSELF WHY I BELIEVE THAT VIEW IS INCORRECT. FIRST. THAT QUESTION WAS NOT BEFORE THE COURT THE ONLY QUESTION BEFORE THE COURT. WAS A PROCEDURAL TIMING QUESTION ABOUT THE DATE OF. THE ELECTION FOR A GENERAL TAX. ONE OF THE VIRTUES OF OUR SUPREME COURT IS JUDICIAL RESTRAINT IT NEVER OFFERS ADVISORY OPINIONS ON QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARY TO DECIDE IN RESOLVING THE CASE BEFORE IT. IN UPLAND WHEN I IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CITY PARADED THE HORRIBLE'S THAT WOULD ENSUE. IF INITIATIVE SPECIAL TAXES WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THE REST OF PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN. COURT AT THAT PAGE NINE FORTY SEVEN OF ITS OPINION SAID. THESE FACTS ARE NOT PRESENTED HERE AND WE DECLINE. TO TAKE UP WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SHOULD THEY ARISE. SECOND. THE UPLAND DECISION ITSELF EXPRESSLY AFFIRMS THAT THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT STILL APPLIES TO SPECIAL TAXES EVEN IF PROPOSED BY INITIATIVE. AT PAGE NINE FORTY THREE THE OPINION OF THE COURT STATES QUOTE. THAT THE VOTERS EXPLICITLY IMPOSED A PROCEDURAL TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT ON THEMSELVES IN ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE SECTION TWO SUBDIVISION DE. IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY DID NOT IMPLICITLY IMPOSE A PROCEDURAL TIMING REQUIREMENT IN SUBDIVISION BE. THIRD. THE UPLAND DECISION ADDRESSED ONLY PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN EVEN IF PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN IT IN ITS ENTIRETY DID NOT APPLY TO INITIATIVES. OUR CONSTITUTION STILL CONTAINS PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WHICH INCLUDES ITS OWN TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR SPECIAL TAXES. A PROP THIRTEEN CASE. MENTION BY GREG TURNER ALTADENA LIBRARY DISTRICT VERSUS BLOODGOOD HELD THAT PROP THIRTEEN REQUIRES TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL FOR SPECIAL TAX AS PROPOSED BY INITIATIVE. AND IN FACT INVALIDATED AN INITIATIVE OF THE PROPOSED A TAX RECEIPT MAJORITY APPROVAL BUT NOT TWO THIRDS. THE ALTADENA LIBRARY CASE WAS BRIEFED IN THE UPLAND CASE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. IF THE SUPREME COURT DISAGREED WITH THE HOLDING IN THAT CASE THAT THE TWO THIRDS VOTE APPLIES TO INITIATIVES IT WOULD HAVE DISAPPROVED ALTADENA LIBRARY AND IT DID NOT. TO BELIEVE THAT ONE MINUTE SIR. ALRIGHT WELL I PLAN DOES CONTAIN SOME ODDLY BROAD LANGUAGE IT IS CLEAR ON UPON CLOSER INSPECTION THAT IT DID NOT MAKE A SEA CHANGE IN TAXPAYER RIGHTS'. THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT STILL APPLIES TO SPECIAL TAX AS PROPOSED BY INITIATIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS IF IT WERE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE MISTER WOLF AS WELL SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.

WE'LL START THE BATTLE IN THE HEARING AS WE STARTED IT AS WE ARE COMING FORWARD. AND IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF OUR FANTASTIC LEGAL PANEL OF BUT. REALLY THE DECISION IS SO CLEAR AS MUD. THERE ARE CHALLENGES AHEAD ON THERE ARE GONNA BE SOME POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS COMING FORWARD THIS YEAR THAT WOULD HELP CLARIFY. THE COURT'S DECISION WITH THE POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE FIX. THERE WILL BE AN INITIATIVE THAT WILL BE MOVING FORWARD. IN NOVEMBER AT THAT WILL ALSO ASSIST IN CLEAR FINE AT LEAST ASKING THE VOTERS TO HELP CLARIFY AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT WE ARE MOST LIKELY GOING TO SEE SOME COURT CASES THAT WILL BE ADVANCED. IF THE DECISION IS TESTED ON THE JUNE BALLOT IN MOST LIKELY AGAIN LOOK INTO THE CRYSTAL BALL. THOSE. RESULTS IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD MOST LIKELY BE CHALLENGED AS THERE MAY BE SOME LEGAL REMEDIES AS WELL.
