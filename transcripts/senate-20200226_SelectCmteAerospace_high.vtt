HERE. I. THE FELT LAB. IN

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:18.264
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- IN IN A

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.999
DESERT AREA AND THE DRONE WAS

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:21.567
WAS AT FOUR HUNDRED FEET AND WE

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.236
GOT- JUST UNDER NINE MILES OF

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:25.938
LATERAL COVERAGE ADEQUATE TO

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:26.539
TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SQUARE

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:29.775
MILES OF COVERAGE WITH STRONG

SIGNAL STRENGTH AND THEN TO THE

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:34.246
RIGHT YEAH THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.781
AND SETS- THAT. COVERAGE

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.883
SHOWING IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA A

TRADITIONAL CELL TOWER AT SIXTY

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:41.353
FEET VERSES THAT THE GRAPHIC

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.322
RIGHT BELOW IT A DRONE AT FOUR

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.889
HUNDRED FEET YOU CAN SEE THE

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.624
DIFFERENCE IN AND COVERAGE AREA

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:48.227
SO TREMENDOUS CAPABILITIES FROM

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:49.228
FROM THESE DRONES WE HAVE

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:51.130
VARIOUS TYPES. OF DRONE

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:52.631
SOLUTIONS IS NOT A ONE SIZE

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:53.999
FITS ALL WE DEPLOY WHATEVER

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:56.135
TYPE OF DROWNED IT TAKES FOR

00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:58.404
THE THAT PARTICULAR. DISASTER

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.505
EMERGENCY SITUATION THAT WE'RE

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:02.174
SUPPORTING WE HAVE- TRADITIONAL

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.576
MULTI ROTOR DRONES WE HAVE

CYCLONE IT'S PHONE AND FIFTY

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.752
SEVEN MILE AN HOUR WINDS- THIS

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:16.021
PARTICULAR JOHN- WHAT WAS USED

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:18.357
TO- RECORD IN THE GAME OF

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:21.293
THRONES- MOVIE FOR HBO IF YOU

WALL- THIS THIS WAS TO DRAW. A

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:26.865
LINE IN ICELAND FOR THAT-

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:28.734
THERE'S ALSO WE HAVE A V. TOLL

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:29.668
SOLUTION TAKES OFF VERTICALLY

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:30.836
LIKE A HELICOPTER TRANSITIONS

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:32.338
COLLATERAL FLIGHT. THAT WAY WE

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:34.907
DON'T NEED A TETHER IF WHERE

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:38.644
ARE OUR OVER FLY AND IT'S

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.848
RESISTANT AND- YES SIR. THE

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:44.316
SAID THAT THE DRAW WE CAN FLY

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:45.417
SIXTEEN HOURS PROVIDING

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:46.719
CONSTANT CONNECTIVITY AT THE

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:47.453
END OF THE SIXTEEN HOURS WE

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.088
LAUNCH A SECOND ROUND AND THEN

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:50.889
JUST JUST KEEP ROTATING THEM WE

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:53.859
HAVE AEROSTATS BLIMPS SIX OF

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:54.560
FIFTY SIX FOOT BLIMP THAT WE

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:55.761
CAN PUT IN THE AIR FOR A COUPLE

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:57.429
OF WEEKS WITHOUT LANDING WITH

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:59.164
MACRO CELL TOWER EQUIPMENT ON

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:01.300
SO THE SAME EQUIPMENT THAT WE

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:01.934
HAVE ON OUR CELL TOWERS WE HAVE

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.969
ON BLANKS- WITH THE END OF TWO

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.771
WEEKS IN. TOWN TOPPED OFF WITH

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:07.039
ADDITIONAL HELIUM PUT IT UP

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:09.208
ANOTHER WEEKS WE CAN ALSO DIED

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:11.377
TURN TRADITIONAL AIRPLANES INTO

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:12.811
SELF LINE CELL TOWERS AS WELL

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:15.281
BY PUTTING THE EQUIPMENT. ON

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:18.384
THEIR- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.487
THAT TETHER ON THE GROUND- THE

00:15:21.553 --> 00:15:22.655
NUMBER THREE IS A SOLUTION I

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.957
PREVIOUSLY SHOWED YOU. OF THAT-

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:26.325
THAT THAT THAT SOLUTIONS VERY

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:27.660
MOBILE WE CAN PUT IT ON THE

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:30.562
BACK OF AN ATV- AND THAT THAT

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:32.898
THE TOP LEFT IS A SOLAR PANELS

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:33.666
VEHICLES SO WE CAN DRIVE THAT

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:35.067
ON SITE. OPEN UP THE SOLAR

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.435
PANELS AND THAT PROVIDES ENOUGH

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:38.003
POWER FOR THE ENTIRE. TIRE

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.439
SOLUTION- THE TOP RIGHT IS OUR

00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:42.408
FIRST NET. A SOLUTION SO THESE

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:43.976
TRAILERS WE LAUNCHED THE DRONES

00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:45.311
FROM THE TRAILERS THEY ALSO

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:46.211
HAVE THE SATELLITE.

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.613
COMMUNICATIONS BUILT INTO THE

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.847
TRAILERS AS WELL SO IT'S ALL

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:51.116
SELF CONTAINED UNITS. THE

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:53.018
BOTTOM LEFT IS AN ALL TERRAIN-

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:53.952
TRAILER THAT THAT'S WHAT W

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:56.121
DEPLOYED TO- TO PORTO RICO

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:58.691
AFTER HURRICANE MARIA TO

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:00.225
RESTORE SERVICES THERE. BACK

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:01.994
CALL WE DEFAULT TO SATELLITE

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:03.896
BUT THAT'S NOT OUR ONLY OPTION.

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:05.731
WE CAN USE A MICROWAVE TO GET

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.399
THE SIGNAL BACK INTO OUR

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.101
NETWORK FREE SPACE OPTICAL-

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:11.337
ETHERNET FIBRE IF THE IF THAT'S

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:12.971
AVAILABLE IN THE CASE OF-

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:15.240
REPORTER RICO- WE DEPLOYED IN

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.242
A- WALMART PARKING LOT. AND

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:18.844
THERE WAS AN ACTIVE- FIBERLINK

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:20.713
AND IN THAT WALMART A WAREHOUSE

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:21.714
SO WE PULLED IT OUT INTO THE

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.781
PARKING LOT AND USE THAT FOR

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.616
BACK ALL INTERESTS SUPPORTED.

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:27.920
HIM THOUSANDS OF USERS THROUGH

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:28.454
THROUGH THAT THROUGH THAT

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.559
CONNECTION. THIS SHOWS. THAT AN

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:36.095
AREA THAT THAT'S A- WHERE IT IS

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.731
A- HEAVILY DENIED AREAS SO

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:40.466
THERE'S NO POWER NO-

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:41.867
INFRASTRUCTURE WHATSOEVER AND

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:42.935
YOU CAN SEE HOW WE CAN PUT UP A

00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:45.237
PRETTY ROUGH ROBUST NETWORK

EXACTLY HOW THESE ARE USED WE

00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:10.449
WHICH WHICH THE FIRES WITH.

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.451
WHAT WAS IT WE WHICH OF THE

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:14.119
FIRES OF THE FLYING CAL USED IN

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:15.521
CALIFORNIA RECENTLY WE USE

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:17.623
TRADITIONAL SAT CALLS FOR THE

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:18.624
CALIFORNIA FIRES WE DID WE

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.093
DIDN'T DEPLOY BUT THE DRONES WE

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:22.261
THEY WERE AVAILABLE THERE ON

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.129
STAND BY BUT- THERE WASN'T A

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:25.731
NEED FOR THEM IN THAT HOW DO

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.165
YOU MAKE THAT DECISION AS TO

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:28.534
WHICH SO IT'S USUALLY BASED ON

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.235
COVERAGE SO A TRADITIONAL SAT

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:32.104
CALLED HAS A TELESCOPING

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.673
ANTENNA MAST- IT'LL GO TO

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.607
SIXTY. FEET AND IF THAT PROVIDE

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:37.776
OF COVERAGE HERE GO WITH THAT.

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.711
WIDER COVERAGE FOR IN MORTGAGE.

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:41.046
TERRAIN TO ACCESS THEN WE WOULD

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:43.382
SEND AN- OF FLYING COW FOR

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:45.417
EXAMPLE THE PGA EVENT I

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:46.585
MENTIONED THERE'S TWO EIGHTEEN

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:47.886
HOLE GOLF COURSES THAT WE WERE

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:49.821
SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT. IT TOOK

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:52.190
THREE TRADITIONAL. SAT CALLS TO

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:53.392
COVER THAT AREA OVER THAT

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:55.661
TERRAIN- BUT INSTEAD WE

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:57.829
DEPLOYED A SINGLE DRONE. IN THE

00:19:57.896 --> 00:19:58.730
MIDDLE OF THE TWO AREAS WE'RE

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:00.499
ABLE TO COVER THE ENTIRE AREA

THEY THEY SURE GREAT PROMISE

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:13.958
FOR THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:33:14.025 --> 00:33:15.793
YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY SEE MORE OF

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.894
IN THE STATE AS WE MOVE

00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:18.629
FORWARD. JUST THE ABILITY TO

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:19.897
GET THIS TYPE OF YOU FOR AN

00:33:19.964 --> 00:33:22.066
INCIDENT COMMANDER- IN IN THE

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.368
INITIAL STAGE OF FIRE THIS

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.470
MIGHT BE BEFORE MAJOR RESOURCES

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:28.139
GET THEIR- IS PRETTY EPIC. THIS

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:30.241
IS A DEMONSTRATION- THIS IS A

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:31.943
LIVE FIRE. THIS IS ONE OF OUR

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:34.512
PILOTS OVER FLYING A UNIT THAT

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:35.947
WAS BEING RE DIRECTED BY THE

00:33:36.013 --> 00:33:36.948
INCIDENT COMMANDER IN SICK MAN

00:33:37.014 --> 00:33:38.783
WAS USING THE FOOTAGE COMING.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.885
BACK THE A LIVE STREAM. TO GET

00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:42.720
THAT ENGINE TO TURN LEFT THERE

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:43.654
WHEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:44.956
THEY WERE GOING TO GET TO THE

00:33:45.022 --> 00:33:46.023
SPOT FIRE THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.892
UP HERE IN SUPPORT ANOTHER UNIT

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:48.793
THAT WAS ACTIVELY WORKING. AND

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.294
YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:50.862
LOOK LIKE IT'S TOUGH TO SEE

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:52.830
FROM THE GROUND. BUT THE

00:33:52.897 --> 00:33:54.699
ABILITY TO PUT A- LIGHT

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.401
AIRCRAFT OVERHEAD AND BE ABLE

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:57.301
TO IMMEDIATELY HAVE THAT

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:59.404
INFORMATION. AND PUSH IT BACK

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.772
TO AN INCIDENT COMMANDER- IS

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:03.708
HUGE IN THE FUTURE- WE

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:05.009
CURRENTLY USE VIDEO STREAMING

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:06.144
TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS US TO

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.712
BASICALLY PUSH OUR IMAGES TO

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:10.381
ANY. OF OUR AUTHORIZED FOLKS

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:11.883
ANYBODY CAN SEE IT IN THE

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:12.683
FUTURE. PUSHING IT TO

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.352
INDIVIDUAL AND COMPANIES

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:15.553
BECOMES A VERY VIABLE

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.689
ALTERNATIVE AS WELL INDIVIDUALS

00:34:18.756 --> 00:34:20.224
ON THE GROUND SIMILAR TO WHAT

00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:23.261
THE MILITARY DOESN'T CASES.

00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:30.134
THIS IS A- FOR CONSTRUCTION

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:33.337
FIRE. LIMITING TO CYCLIC HELP.

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:36.908
BUYING A- HOT OF THE GROUP WERE

00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:37.708
ABLE TO LOCATE. SO BY JUMPING

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:38.910
OVER THE TOP OF THIS AND USING

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.011
FOR IMAGING WORKING IT WERE IN

00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:41.012
TO. GET THEM WHERE THEY NEED BE.

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:42.480
THAT'S A FAIRLY SENSE. MEASURE

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:43.714
FAR COVERS. NOW MILES AND-

00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:46.851
RIVER AND- WE A LOT OF TIME ON

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:47.485
THE RIVER THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:48.386
REST CALLS A ON EVERY YEAR IT'S

00:34:48.453 --> 00:34:50.388
A VERY. HOT RIVER IT'S HEAVILY

00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:53.057
USED- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:53.925
WE DO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:55.660
UNIQUE TO SOME OTHER PARTS OF

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:56.260
THE COUNTRIES WE SPEND A LOT

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:58.629
TIME OVER WATER- WHETHER IT BE.

00:34:58.696 --> 00:34:59.664
SEARCH AND RESCUE

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.999
IDENTIFICATION OR OVERSIGHT AS

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:03.267
THIS IS HERE'S HIS TRAINING

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:05.136
WITH- FAMOUS CALIFORNIA TASK

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:07.672
FORCE SEVEN OVER THE RIVER-

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:09.040
GIVING THE INCIDENT COMMANDER

00:35:09.106 --> 00:35:10.775
OF THE CREWS ON THE GROUND A

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:11.342
BETTER VIEW OF WHAT THEY'RE

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:12.844
GETTING INTO. IS A PRETTY HUGE

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.645
PART OF WHAT THE CAMERA SYSTEMS

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:16.714
ALLOW- SPECIALLY WHEN YOU START

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.150
LOOKING AT THE COST OF THE

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:20.284
CAMERAS BEING RELATIVELY

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:21.819
INEXPENSIVE FOR THOSE IN

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:24.155
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CLARITY THAT

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:25.756
THEY'RE BRINGING- THESE

00:35:25.823 --> 00:35:27.825
AIRCRAFT CAN BE WASTED OFF IN A

00:35:27.892 --> 00:35:29.794
VERY SAFE LOCATION. AND STILL

00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:30.761
GIVE YOU PRETTY IMPRESSIVE

00:35:30.828 --> 00:35:33.264
IMAGERY- THIS AIRCRAFT IS

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.565
PROBABLY A LINEAR DISTANCE OF

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.634
ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET AWAY. AND

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:39.103
THAT'S- THE TAX INFORMATION WE

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.638
CAN PULL BACK FOR A SICK

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:41.906
MATTER. TECHNICAL SEARCH AND

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.474
RESCUE SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:45.343
BEEN A DIFFICULTY IN THE FIRE

00:35:45.409 --> 00:35:46.043
SERVICE IT'S ONE OF THOSE

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.546
THINGS IT'S UNIQUE. A NOT A

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:50.281
SELDOM USED SKILLED WHEN IT

00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:52.850
NEEDS TO BE IN- EMPLOYED IT'S

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.318
KIND OF THE ONLY THING. MORE

00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:59.357
THE ONLY SEES TO IT SO. THE USE

00:35:59.423 --> 00:36:02.226
OF YOUR VISA CRAFT TO JUMP OVER

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:03.494
THE TOP OF A COLLAPSE THIS IS

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:05.963
COLLAPSE DOWN AND BEAR TO

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.764
IMAGERY AND TO PUT THAT A MAJOR

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.132
ON A REAL FOR OUR SEARCHERS TO

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:10.234
BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW WHERE

00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:11.302
THEY'RE SEARCHING WHAT THEY'RE

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:13.070
LOOKING AT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:14.605
FOR IS FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE IT

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.941
ALSO HELPS US TO PUT AYE AYES

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.143
INTO A SITUATION THAT MAY NOT

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.613
BE SAFE TO PUT OUR PEOPLE INTO

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.448
THE WE CAN LOOK IN. THE WHOLE

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:25.216
LAST THING THAT OTHERWISE WE

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:30.054
WOULDN'T. A TECHNICAL RESCUE-

00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:30.988
ONE OF THE INTERESTING PARTS OF

00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:32.523
TECHNICAL RESCUE IS THAT IT

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.358
HAPPENS ABOVE AND BELOW GRADE

00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:36.727
SO WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY ON

00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:39.864
LEVEL- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:41.632
USES WHERE BEING ABLE TO STAND

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:43.701
BACK AND GIVES THE RESCUE TEAMS

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:45.069
INCOMING RESCUE TEAMS ARE

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:46.337
INCIDENT COMMANDERS VIEWS OF

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.072
WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING AND

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:49.674
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.609
ALLOWS IN THE PRE PLAN AND PRE

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.110
DEPLOY THEIR RESOURCES IT'S

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:54.445
REALLY HARD ON TECHNICAL RESCUE

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:56.847
CALLS TO GET THE HARDWARE THAT

00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:58.683
YOU NEED IN POSITION FINALLY

00:36:58.749 --> 00:36:59.617
MANNER BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.619
OF IT- KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:04.255
GETTING INTO AHEAD OF TIME LETS

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:05.590
YOU PREPAY AND THAT SO WE'RE

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.858
FLYING ON THE BACK. OF THE

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:12.697
CHIEFS RIDE. AND BASICALLY

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:13.464
GIVING THE INCOMING TEAM OF YOU

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:14.765
OF WHAT THE OUTCOME TEAM WAS

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.867
DOING I'VE ALSO DONE TRAINING

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:18.936
RECENTLY WITH- FLYING THE LINES

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:20.104
OF THE TOP OF OPTICAL SO

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.973
INSTEAD OF PUSHING A LINE OUT

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:23.374
WITH A LINE DOWN WE CAN DO IT

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:26.043
NOW WITH AIRCRAFT AS MATERIALS

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.378
ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE WE SEEN

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.714
HUGE INCREASE OVER THE STATE

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.983
ARE OVER THE COUNTRY.

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:32.717
ESPECIALLY IN THE EAST COAST.

00:37:32.783 --> 00:37:33.884
BEING ABLE TO PUT AN AIRCRAFT

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:34.952
IN POSITION WHERE YOU DON'T

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:37.054
WANT TO PUT PEOPLE AND GIVE-

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:39.090
THE HAZMAT TEAMS OF YOU. OF

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.825
PERHAPS AERIAL GAS MONITORING

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:42.126
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING THERE

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.060
WERE FLYING GAS MONITORS

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:45.229
THROUGH A PLUME AND ALLOWING

00:37:45.296 --> 00:37:46.430
RESOURCES ON THE GROUND SEE

00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:49.000
WHERE THAT PLANE IS. MODEL IT

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:49.734
FIGURE OUT HOW FAR IT'S GOING

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.602
TO STRETCH OUT. IS A REALLY

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:54.238
INTERESTING CONCEPT FOR USE.

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:57.074
BECAUSE IT DOES. FLOOD HERE WE

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:58.609
DO FLOOD OPERATIONS AS WELL THE

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.311
OVER FLAT FLAT OPERATIONS IS A

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:04.015
FAIRLY. MAJOR USE CASE FOR US

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:05.583
WHEN IT'S RAINING. GETTING

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.685
AHEAD OF A FLOODED AREA BEING

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:08.953
ABLE TO GO OUT AND LOOK AT

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.655
AREAS THAT ARE CURENTLY FLOOD

00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:11.989
AND SEE WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:13.791
IMPACT OUR ACCESS AND EGRESS TO

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:16.193
THAT AREA. IS A HUGE PORTION OF

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.329
GETTING US IN POSITION TO MAKE

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:19.430
EFFECTIVE RESCUES WHEN IT

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:21.165
BECOMES NECESSARY IT'S PRE

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:22.099
PLANNING GETTING OUT WHEN IT'S

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.367
FLOODED BEING ABLE TO LOOK OVER

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:24.502
THE TOP OF A GIVE ARE BOTH

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:25.870
COMPANIES AND OUR GROUND CREWS

00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:27.538
IN VIEW. OF WHAT'S GOING ON

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:30.007
CURRENTLY SO THAT IN TWO HOURS

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:30.975
IF THEY GET A CALL FOR

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:32.176
ASSISTANCE THEY KNOW KIND OF

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:34.779
WHERE WE'RE AT ALREADY- THIS IS

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:36.647
A LIVE. MISSION THIS IS A

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:38.182
RESCUE MISSION FOR A DRIVER WHO

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:39.950
DROVE THROUGH SOME CLOTHES ROAD

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:41.352
SIGNS AND ENDED UP FLOODING IS

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.154
VEHICLE OUT. WE ARE ABLE TO

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.455
OVERFLY THIS EVEN WITH THOSE

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:47.925
TREES AND GET A VIEW FOR OUR-

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.427
FOR OUR RESCUE TEAM BEFORE THEY

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:50.494
WALKED IN SO THEY KNEW WHAT

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:51.662
THEY WERE WALKING INTO WE ALSO

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:52.997
HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.532
PAYLOAD DELIVERY. SO WE CAN

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:56.767
RELEASE PFDS ON- PERSONAL

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:59.437
FLOTATION DEVICES. ON TO PEOPLE

00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:00.204
WHO MAY BE STRANDED ON THE

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:03.207
RIVER- OR IN A FLOOD SITUATION

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:04.675
AS WE KEEP THEM SAFE. THIS IS

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:06.844
MERRY. RIVER WHERE PEOPLE

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:08.345
REASON LIKE TO PUT. IN EVERY

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:09.580
COOPER STREET IS AN ACTIVE

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:11.215
SCENES ARE BOTH CREWS WILL GO

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:13.551
OUT AND TRY TO MAKE CONTACT TO

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:14.318
MAKE SURE THERE'S NOBODY INSIDE

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:19.090
THAT VEHICLE. THE OVERSTATE THE-

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:19.924
BE ERICA. OVER THE HEAD AND

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.727
GIVES. CREW A GREAT VIEW OF

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:23.260
WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO

00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:25.229
BEFORE THEY GET THERE. SO

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:26.363
THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE USES.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.099
WE FOUND FOR OUR CRAFTING WE

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:30.101
SEE THAT USE REALLY REGION WIDE

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:32.970
BETWEEN LINE FIRE- THE FUTURE

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.939
THAT IS MORE. IN DEPTH AND

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:36.841
COMPLICATED SENSORS ARTISTS A

00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:03.113
IMPORTANCE TO BE ABLE TO- UAVS

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:09.353
IN MY OPINION- REALLY COOL MEN.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.422
THE WORK DEMAND. IF THERE. FULL

THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA IN VERY

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.829
COMPLEX AIR SPACE IN IN

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:21.865
COORDINATION WITH- WITH MANNED

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:23.934

HAVEN'T SO THAT'S JUST REALLY

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.042
AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT THINKS

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:34.211
IT IS TO BE MADE. AND OF

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:35.579
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND WHAT I

STARTED USING YOU AS IN%

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:44.121
DISASTER SCENES ON BACK AT THE

00:43:44.188 --> 00:43:45.422
TRAGIC GO SHIP FIRED OAKLAND

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:47.091
WHERE- THIRTY SIX PEOPLE

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:49.026
TRAGICALLY LOST THEIR LIVES. IT

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:50.027
WAS THE FIRST TIME WE REALIZE

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:52.262
THE U. S. COULD ADD VALUE TO

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:53.931
THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THE

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.666
FIREFIGHTERS IN SEARCH AND

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:56.734
RESCUE PEOPLE ARE DOING. IN

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.635
TERMS OF LOOKING FOR VICTIMS

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:01.305
THERMAL IMAGING FOR HOT SPOTS

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:02.239
PRIOR TO SENDING PEOPLE INTO

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:04.141
DANGEROUS AREA. AS VERY

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.944
IMPORTANT STUFF SO WE LEARNED A

00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:08.679
LOT FROM THAT TRAGIC INCIDENT

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:10.214
AND THAT THE FIRES IN THE NOMA

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.516
CAME ABOUT IN COFFEE PARK THE

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.785
TRAGEDY IN COFFEE PARK AND I

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:16.320
HAD A MAP HERE TO SHOW YOU OF

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:19.690
THAT. WHERE WE TO THOUSAND BASS

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:21.859
LOW LEVEL AND STITCH THEM TO.

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:24.595
INTO NOR OF MUSIC MATT. SO THE

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:25.929
CITIZENS LIVE THERE BUT

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:29.800
COULDN'T BACK IN COULD TAKE A

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:33.937
LOOK AT THE MAP. DOWN TO STREET.

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:35.906
IN A ONE WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR-

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:38.876
SEE WITH HAVING TO GO INTO SO.

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:40.044
THAT MAPPING REAL AND AS PART

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.245
OF A INTO GRAY AMBER MAY

00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:43.480
STRATEGY FAST FORWARD TO THE

00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:45.616
FIRES IN IN REDDING WE DID SOME

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:47.151
MORE MAPPING OUT THERE BUT THEN

00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:49.420
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT A SMALL

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:52.056
DRONE CAN CAN BE SET UP IN THE

00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:53.957
SKY AT A HUNDRED FEET TWO

00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:54.925
HUNDRED FEET OR WHATEVER CAL

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:57.327
FIRE ALLOW. AND TAKE A QUICK

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:59.563
SERIES OF SNAPSHOTS IN STITCH

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:02.599
TOGETHER IN INDIAN ALMOST

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:05.402
INSTANTANEOUSLY- A MODEL OF

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:06.637
WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:08.038
NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH STAND CAN BE

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:09.907
UPLOADED TO THE COUNTY OR

00:45:09.973 --> 00:45:11.442
CITY'S WEBSITE AND RESIDENTS

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:13.343
CAN CLICK ON IT AND SEE WHAT'S

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.447
GOING ON IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD-

00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:18.315
FAST FORWARD TO BUTTE COUNTY. A

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:21.285
YEAR AFTER THAT. WE WERE ABLE

00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:23.353
TO GO UP WITH THE TEAM A TEAM

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.656
OF THE UAV OPERATORS FIFTEEN

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:27.091
DIFFERENT EAMS. WITH THE

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:29.393
PERMISSION OF CALIFORNIA THE TO

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.363
IN A COORDINATED MANNER- TAKE.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.431
SEVENTY THOUSAND PHOTOGRAPHS

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:37.067
OVER FIVE HUNDRED FLIGHTS IN

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:39.036
AND OUT OF HERE FOR YOU IN TWO

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:41.271
DAYS AND STITCH THOSE TOGETHER

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:43.173
WHERE- PEOPLE COULD LOOK AT THE

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.275
DAMAGE THEIR PROPERTY. AND THEN

00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:47.244
WE USE A NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED-

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.813
SURVEY WHERE WE ENTER WE

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.882
OVERLAID VIDEOS WERE NOT ONLY

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:53.383
COULD YOU SEE YOUR YOUR

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:54.518
PROPERTY BUT YOU COULD SEE A

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:56.053
VIDEO FLY THROUGH OF YOUR

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.722
PROPERTY. SO I TRULY BELIEVE

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:02.526
THAT THE MAPPING IS CRITICAL

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:05.696
FOR DISASTER ZONES- IN IN IS

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:07.131
THE FIFTH AT THE FEET COULD BE

00:46:07.197 --> 00:46:08.532
INTERRELATE OVER A SERIES OF

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:09.800
DIFFERENT LAYERS YOU KNOW

00:46:09.867 --> 00:46:14.571
THERE'S MAPPING LAYERS. IN THIS

00:46:14.638 --> 00:46:15.472
U. S. DATA. CAN BE THEM LATE

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:17.908
INTO THAT. ALSO IN TERMS OF

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:21.311
URGENCY RESPONSE. I CAN'T COME.

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:23.380
OVER TO MADE THE THERMAL

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.816
IMAGING CAPABILITY- IN SO NO MY

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.751
COUNTY WHEN PEOPLE WERE

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:29.553
UNACCOUNTED FOR AND THE

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.122
AUTHORITIES HAD LIKELY AREAS

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:34.158
WHERE THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE.

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:37.828
TO SEND A UAV AN AUNT AND GET A

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:40.330
THERMAL IMAGE A THERMAL READING

00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:42.199
BEFORE SENDING A SEARCH AND

00:46:42.266 --> 00:46:43.734
RESCUE PERSON BEFORE STANDING

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.370
CANINE IN THERE TO AREAS ARE

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:50.574
STILL HOT. REALLY IN OR

00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:51.175
TECHNOLOGY AND ALL DIFFERS THE

00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:52.242
SCENE. YOU KNOW TO TAKE AN

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:53.710
AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH AND PRESERVE

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:56.947
THE SCENE. SO A WHOLE WHOLE

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:58.682
CLOTHES ARE MAKE SURE YOU GET

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:00.017
THE LINKS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:01.652
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:04.755
COMMITTEE SEE THIS DATA- AND

00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:05.622
JUST IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO

THE FIRST TIME THAT I'M AWARE

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:37.079
OF USING- THIS- REMOTELY

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:39.015
PILOTED AIRCRAFT KIND OF

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:41.918
SYSTEMS FOR OUR OWN USE- AT CAL

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:45.855
FIRE- WAS WAS- ACTUALLY- FATAL

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:46.822
ACCIDENT ONE OF OUR

ON A SMALL REMOTELY POWER-

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:10.012
PILOTED AIRCRAFT AND WERE ABLE

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:11.914
TO AGREED THE AREA AND WE USE

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:14.383
THAT FOOTAGE FOR- FOR OUR

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.719
SERIOUS ACCIDENT REVIEW VERY

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:19.255
KEY- TO HAVE THAT VIEW AND THAT

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.324
CAPABILITY. IN THAT KIND OF

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.993
TYPE OF- SCENARIO SO THE FIRST

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.495
TIME THOSE TWO THOUSAND TEN.

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:27.964
AFTER THAT ANALOGY I'M GONNA

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.099
GET MORE INTO WILD FIRE WHAT

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.368
WHAT WAS THE WILD FIRE KIND OF

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:34.837
A SETTING FOR THIS THE SMALL

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:37.974
REMOTELY- BISLETT AIRCRAFT ARE

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.844
ARE GOOD FOR SMALL AREAS OR AS

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.312
YOU CAN STAY AS WE HEARD IN-

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:47.450
THE PREVIOUS- TESTIMONY.

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:48.184
THEY'RE THEY'RE GOOD FOR SEEING

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:50.419
CERTAIN PARTS OF FIRES BUT WHAT

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:53.055
WE FOUND WAS- WE WENT INTO A

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:57.460
PERIOD- AROUND 200-013-1213

01:04:57.526 --> 01:04:59.128
WHERE WE ARE STARTING TO HAVE

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:03.733
MASSIVE WILDFIRES. MIGHT HAPPEN

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:04.333
EARLIER THAN THAT IN SOUTHERN

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:04.867
CALIFORNIA BUT TECHNOLOGY

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:07.403
HADN'T CAUGHT UP. SO WHERE WE

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:11.340
ARE- IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:11.874
IS THE RIM FIRE OVER TWO

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.276
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.410
ACRES JUST APPEARED STANISLAUS

01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:18.114
NOW NATIONAL FOREST. AND WE

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:22.285
USED- AT THAT TIME- CALIFORNIA

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:25.955
NATIONAL GUARD M. Q. NINE-

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:29.058
PREDATOR TYPE. ASSISTANT

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.927
VIEWING OF THE FIRE TO WATCH

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:32.995
WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:35.631
GROUNDS TO IDENTIFY PERIMETER

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:39.068
IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS IDENTIFY-

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:42.204
SPOTS OVER LINES AND LOOK AT

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:43.339
THE PROGRESSION AND WHERE THE

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:45.708
FIRE WAS. LIKELY TO IMPACT BOTH

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.977
OUR OUR CREWS ON THE GROUND BUT

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:51.213
ALSO- OR- COMMUNITIES THAT WERE

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.948
TRYING TO PROTECT THAT WAS THAT

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:55.718
WAS THE FIRST LARGE SCALE USE-

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:58.788
AND IT WAS VERY TELLING AS TO

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:00.189
WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY WAS GONNA

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:02.525
TAKE US. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO

01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:04.327
CONSUME IT IN THE WAY THAT WE

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:05.995
NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONSUME IT

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.263
AND WE ARE STARTING TO CONSUME

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.131
IT CURRENTLY. WE COULD SEE

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:10.633
THINGS BUT WE COULDN'T

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.934
COMMUNICATE TO THE GROUND

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.570
TROOPS WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:16.305
THEIR LOCATION THAT WE COULD

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:20.076
SEE- FROM A DISTANCE. SO

EVACUATE. ALL OF THE YOUR BILL

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:25.074
SILLY BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:26.509
WATCH AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:27.376
