00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:38.196
DIFFERENT AVENUES FOR RECRUITING

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:39.965

TAKING.

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.502
THE TEST ONLINE IT SHOULD BE AS

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:45.003
MANY DEPARTMENTS IN A LOT OF

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:56.548
SO THAT TAKES A LOT OF

00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:57.816

00:21:57.883 --> 00:21:59.251

00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:36.587
CURRENT BACKLOG IN WHAT CAN BE

ASKING FOR MORE MONEY FOR PER

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.302
BURNED AND KIND OF YELLING

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:52.670
SCREAMING WHY ARE THEY MOVING

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:54.806
CASES MORE -- SO IT'S SOMETHING

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:56.641
THAT I'M VERY AWARE OF GOING IN

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:57.942
THIS POSITION I APPRECIATE ALL

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.177
THE SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:00.845
THE GOVERNOR OF GETTING GIVEN ON

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:03.781
THE BUDGET -- THAT'S BEEN ABLE --

00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:05.216
TO PROVIDERS MORE ATTORNEYS AT

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:07.051
EVERY LEVEL MORE MORE BORDER

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:10.655
VISORS -- I THINK -- THE BIG

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:12.457
CHALLENGE THAT WE FIND ON THE

00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:14.192
CASELOAD IS IT'S JUST NOT

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:15.793
NECESSARY THE NUMBERS BUT THE

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.428
DYNAMICS OF THE NUMBERS SOME OF

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:18.763
THE CASES ARE VERY EASY TO

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.365
PROCESS THROUGH SOME OF THEM

00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:21.933
TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO BECAUSE

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:22.900
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:24.135
RIGHT IT'S GOING. TO TAKE SOME

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:26.871
TIME TO DO IT AND SO EACH SIDE

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:27.672
OF THE THE THE COIN WHETHER

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:29.140
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE O THE

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.709
EMPLOYER OR THE UNIONS ITSELF.

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:33.978
NEED TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:35.646
GET A FAIR STRONG DELIVERED OF

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:38.182
DECISION SOME OF THAT TAKES SOME

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:39.751
TIME SO REALLY IT.

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:40.818
IT AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE

00:33:40.885 --> 00:33:42.253
NUMBERS IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.755
BIGGEST NUMBERS FOR PROBABLY

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:45.223
MOVE CASES THROUGH THIS YEAR --

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:48.192
THE BACKLOG IN THE FORTIES BUT

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:49.761
IT REALLY IS A QUESTION OF

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:51.396
RESOURCES AND IN EVERY SORT

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:52.530
ENOUGH RESOURCES SO WE CAN

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:53.564
PROCESS THE CASES.

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:59.537
I THINK ONE THING YOU ALSO

00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:00.872
SHARED IS.

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:02.273
NOT ALL CASES REQUIRE SOME

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.609
DEMAND A LOT MORE -- RESOURCES

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:05.977
IN TIME IS THAT ACCURATE YEAH I

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:07.445
I THINK AND THE EXAMPLE USE NOT

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:08.246
TO GIVE ANY DETAILS AS WELL WELL

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:08.846
I'VE BEEN PERSON WORKING ON A

00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:10.648
CASE -- SINCE MARCH -- AND WE'RE

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.183
NOT CLOSE TO ANY FINAL

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.051
DETERMINATION THEY UNDERSTAND

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:15.520
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:16.621
ON BOTH SIDES.

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:18.222
AND IN THE PROBABLY UP ON APPEAL

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:19.223
SO YOU WANT TO GET THE RECORD

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.958
CORRECT AN IN DEPTH BECAUSE IT'S

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:22.360
GOING TO GO UP ON APPEAL AND BE

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:23.995
TAKING A LOOK AT SO YOU KNOW WE

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:25.163
COULD WE COULD COME TO A

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.731
DECISION A LOT FASTER.

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:27.765
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ANY

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:29.000
PARTIES AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.768
PROCESS AND I THINK ONE THING I

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:34.238
FOUND IMPRESSIVE THAN YOU MIGHT

00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:34.906
SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEES.

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:36.707
THE LOW PERCENTAGE OF CASES THAT

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:37.975
HAVE BEEN REVERSED ON APPEAL

00:34:38.042 --> 00:34:39.777
WHICH I THINK'S STRONGLY TO THE
