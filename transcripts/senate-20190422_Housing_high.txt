FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING IMPROVING AND PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN BUDGET CAT BUDGET. ACT. APPROVAL WAS GRANTED DISSOLVING THE STATE'S FOUR HUNDRED REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THESE ARE AGENCIES SERVED A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT -- THROUGH REDEVELOPMENT AND CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES PROVIDING NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. ANNUALLY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE CLOSURE OF REDEVELOPMENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE REMOVAL OF FINANCING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING I KNOW THE CHAIR IS PROBABLY THE MOST. PASSIONATE PERSON IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- TOOK A HIT WHEN REDEVELOPMENT -- WAS DISSOLVED GLENDALE WAS LEFT WITH TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF NON HOUSING DOLLARS FROM THE CENTRAL GLENDALE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT -- IT IS THEIR DESIRE TO USE THAT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- AND LEVERAGE IT AND I'M TOLD THERE MAY BE AS MANY AS FOUR HUNDRED UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IF THIS BILL GETS SIGNED INTO LAW -- SO THEY WANT TO USE 1100% OF THAT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I THIS THINK THEY NEED TO BE COMMENDED FOR THAT DESIRE. BUT WE NEED THIS BILL TO AUTHORIZE THEM TO DO THAT IN WHAT THEY'VE TOLD ME IS THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT TO ACQUIRE SOME PROPERTY AND THEN LEVERAGES THE FINANCING. TO I THINK CREATE A POT OF UP TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO SPEND ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO -- I HAVE CARE ROSS HERE FROM THE CITY OF GLENDALE ALSO AT HER VOICE AND WE SPEC FOR YES FROM MY BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CARE RUSSELL WE HAVE THE CITY OF GLENDALE THE CITY TAKES ITS COMMITMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SERIOUSLY WE BELIEVE IT IS OUR OBLIGATION RESPONSIBILITY AND OUR DUTY TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHENEVER AND WHEREVER WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS GLENDALE IS CREATE A CLOSE TO SEVEN HUNDRED OF OUR NEARLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED NEW CONSTRUCTION AFFORDABLE UNITS FOR LOWER INCOME SENIORS FAMILIES AND SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS. SUCH AS VETERANS AND VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE CITY ALSO HAS IMPROVED HOUSING ELEMENT. THE CITY IN GLENDALE HOUSING AUTHORITY HAVE ADOPTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING STRATEGY THAT IDENTIFIES THE FUNDS TOOLS POLICIES NEEDED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF ALL TYPES OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS STRATEGY IS ALLOWING GLENDALE TO MOST EFFECTIVELY FOCUS ITS RESOURCES TO MEET ITS HOUSING NEED. THE STRATEGY IS BUILT CONSENSUS DEFINED NEEDS AND AS IDENTIFIED RESOURCES FOR FUNDING AND SB FIVE THIRTY TWO IS ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS. BUT THE TASK THAT GLENDALE IS CURED AND STAFF TO DO WITH OUR GLENDALE HOUSING AUTHORITY AND WITH OUR DEDICATED STAFF WITH IDENTIFIED LOCATIONS WITHIN THE CITY WHERE PORTABLE HOUSING CAN BE DEVELOPED. THERE ARE IDEALLY LOCATIONS THAT ARE NEAR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SCHOOLS AND YOUR GOODS AND SERVICES. THE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION THAT WAS REQUESTED TO BE BE PURPOSE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN BE LEVERAGED WITH ANOTHER APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY MILLION IN FINANCING THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS AND OUR WITH OUR DEVELOPMENT TEAMS. THE COUNTY THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT IS A CRISIS THE GLENDALE HAS NOT ESCAPED AND WE DEFINITELY WANT TO SERVE OUR RESIDENTS AND THOSE HOUSEHOLDS IN NEED. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW GLENDALE TO USE TO THE USE THAT DEDICATED FUNDING TO DEVELOP NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IN THE REGION AS A WHOLE. THE FUNDING OF THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE LEVERAGE FUNDING FROM OTHER SOURCES CAN HELP US DEVELOP UP TO FOUR HUNDRED NEW UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF ME START OFF BY INDICATING THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE. PRESENTED IN -- GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE -- BY SENATOR MCGUIRE ON MY BEHALF LAST WEEK AND I APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO PENSION FOR ME IN THAT. SO WE WILL ACCEPT THOSE AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS -- I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT. WE WILL BE TAKING -- TODAY THAT REDUCES -- TO INTENT LANGUAGE. A COUPLE OF PROPOSALS SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE PRIMARY ISSUE OF THIS BILL WHICH IS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE DAMAGE. WORLD NOT IN -- ANYWAY USING THAT AS A WAY TO UNDERMINE OUR RENO. REQUIREMENTS FOR HOUSING SO I WILL ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. AGAIN THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS IS NOT TO GAIN RAIN EXEMPTIONS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT AGAINST CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES SO. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE. THAT EFFORT TO DO SENATORS AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE SO THERE. THEY'RE COMING FINANCE AMENDMENTS. ATTENTION THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS AND THEN FROM FROM THIS COMMITTEE WERE TO AMENDMENTS THE ONE YOU JUST. MENTIONED ARE REDUCING TO ATTEND LANGUAGE SO WE CAN KEEP WORKING -- AND AND IT WAS THE OTHER ONE THAT LANGUAGE CLARIFYING. THAT IF THE LOCALITY MIX FINDINGS THAT PREVENTED THAT PREVENTS IT FROM APPROVING A BUILDING PERMIT AND A VIOLENT URBAN INTERFACE ABOUT WILL NOT NEGATE ITS RETALIATION. I'M SORRY WOULD YOU. YES IS IT LISTED IN THE HOUSE. SO THAT ISN'T THAT SWEET WE HAD A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS THAT THAT WE TRUST CAME UP WITH JUST A SHORT TIME AGO. WITHIN TEN LANGUAGE WITH THE INTENT WHEN DOES NOT I'D ARTICULATED THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT IF I MAY -- I APOLOGIZE I SHOULD HAVE IT. TRY TO THESE FOR THE ONES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND I AND THAT -- WE WOULD BE TAKING -- Z. PROVISIONAL WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEGATE RENO THIS ARENA OBLIGATION. AND THEN THIS IS KNOWN OF LOS SIX USERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NO NET LOSS ONE CORRECT THAT WHEN WE'RE GOING. TO RETAIN SO. TO THAT'S GOING TO KNOWING THAT LOSS IS GOING INTO THE BILL YES WHICH WAS WHAT YOU OKAY WHICH IS WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IN AGREED. TO THE OTHER ONE IS THE ONE THAT WE'RE STILL GOING TO WIN THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON WHICH DEALS WITH THE INTENT -- OF LOWERING THE RENO NUMBER. AND THAT WE CLEARLY ARE NOT ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT IN THIS BILL AND THAT WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON LANGUAGE IT SATISFIES. AND CLARIFIES. TWO TO EVERYONE'S. OF THE COMFORT LEVEL THAT WE ARE. GOING TO CREATE THAT BALANCE WE NEED AND SO. I BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE IT WAS PROPOSES THAT THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND DECLARES NEED TO RECONCILE. THE CONFLICTING GOALS OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF STATES RESIDENTS THAT WILL FACE WILDFIRE RISK. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ADDRESSING DECADES OF LOW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION RATES. AND THE COLORS THE INTENT TO DETERMINE A METHOD OF ADDRESSING THESE TWO GOALS. IN THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PROCESS THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING -- SO STOP. SENATE THE AUTHOR. AND THE COMMITTEE WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS BUT WE NEED MORE TIME -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING BOTH THIS CRITICAL NEEDS -- AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WORKING WITH US AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO CLARIFY AND COME UP WITH LANGUAGE IN THE COMING WEEKS THANK YOU. SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL ONE EIGHTY TWO THIS IS A BILL THAT REDUCES THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE DAMAGE IN CALIFORNIA -- TO OUR COMMUNITIES BY STRENGTHENING LOCAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTING DEVELOPMENT IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS. BY DIRECTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE RETROFIT STRATEGIES FOR STRUCTURES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE NEED. OF WHAT WE REFER TO AS FIRE HARDENING. ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING WE NEED TO PROTECT TO THE EXTENT WE CANDLES INFRASTRUCTURES BY DOING THINGS THAT WE KNOW. WE'LL CREATE GREATER PROTECTIONS -- IN THE CASE OF FIRE -- END OF I AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN ENSURING THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE -- WALLS -- ALSO RECOGNIZING THE NEEDS OF FURTHER -- HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN OUR STATE. MEMBERS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OUR STATE HAS EXPERIENCE WITHOUT DOUBT THE LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASONS IN ITS HISTORY. COMBINATION OF YEARS OF DROUGHT FUELS ACCUMULATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND DO SEVERE WEATHER. HAVE RESULTED IN WILDFIRES FIRES OF UNPRECEDENTED SIZE AND INTENSITY THAT HAVE KILLED WELL OVER A HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND BURNED WELL OVER A MILLION ACRES. CALIFORNIA'S PERSISTENT THREAT OF WILDFIRE POSES A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO HOMES AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WELL MUCH IS BEING DONE TO BETTER MANAGE OUR FORESTS. MORE MUST BE DONE TO HARDEN OUR EXISTING HOMES TO MAKE THEM MORE RESISTANT TO WILDFIRE. AND IMPROVE LAND USE DECISIONS TO MINIMIZE THIS THREAT. PARTICULARLY TO NEW COMMUNITIES INCREASINGLY BEING BUILT IN WILDLAND AREAS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS MOVIES WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE. AND MUCH OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR IS BUILT IN THESE AREAS WHICH ARE PRONE. TO WILD FIRES AND OTHER DISASTERS. AT A MARCH THIRTEENTH HEARING FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT IN FIRE PRONE REGIONS THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND NATURAL RESOURCE COMMITTEE. RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ACTION TO BOLSTER LOCAL PLANNING EFFORTS TO DESIGN MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. CONDITION DEVELOPMENT APPROVED APPROVALS TO ENSURE THAT STRUCTURES AND COMMUNITIES ARE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM FIRE. OR ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT OUT OF HARM'S WAY. THIS BILL. THE GOAL AND ITS AIM IS TO DO EXACTLY THAT. THIS MEASURE REQUIRES STRATEGIC LOCAL PLANNING FOR RETROFITTING EXISTING AT RESTRUCTURES. MODIFIES LOCAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE FIRE RISK THROUGH BETTER PLANNING AND COMMUNITY DESIGN. AND GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FLEXIBILITY WHEN MEETING REGIONAL GOALS FOR NEW HOUSING. AMONG OTHER THINGS IT CONDITIONS NEW CONSTRUCTION AND IDENTIFIED WHAT WE AREAS UPON CITIES AND COUNTIES MEETING. SPECIFIED WILDLIFE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS. IT REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO VERIFY ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH DEFENSIBLE SPACE. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND LOCAL FIRE PLAN AND WHILE FIRE HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS INCLUDING DOCUMENTING COMPLIANCE FOR EACH IMPACTED PROPERTY. AT LEAST EVERY THREE YEARS AND IT TO REX COUNTIES IN TANDEM WITH UPDATING THEIR GENERAL PLAN SAFETY ELEMENT. TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE RETROFIT STRATEGY. FOR ST STRUCTURES THAT ARE VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRE. INCLUDING PROCESSING. UP OR PROCESSES FOR IDENTIFYING IMPACTED INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS AND MILESTONES FOR COMPLETING RETROFIT WORK AND IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL POTENTIAL FUNDING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES. NOW WHILE THIS IS NOT EXACTLY THE SEXY STUFF IN THE WORLD IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IF WE ARE GOING TO BE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT SET OF WILDFIRES. THAT RUN THROUGH OUR STATE CAUSING PROPERTY DAMAGE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LOSS OF LIFE. REQUIRINGALL DEVELOPMENT IN WE WE AREAS TO MEET SPECIFIED FIRE RESPONSE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND IGNITION RISK REDUCTION BUT SCALING THOSE REQUIREMENTS BY THE NUMBER OF UNITS BUILT FOR DEVELOPMENT. AND I CAN TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT HOW IN THE RECENT FIRES THERE WAS INADEQUATE WATER INADEQUATE ELECTRICITY INADEQUATE ALL SORTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED. DEAL WITH THESE FIRES AND THE LOSS OF LIFE WE ARE NOW TRYING TO BE AS PROACTIVE IN THIS PREEMPTIVE FOR THE NEXT SET OF THE VANCE SO THAT WE CAN AVOID -- THOSE TRAGEDIES. THE BILL ALSO DIRECTS THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO UNDERTAKE A NOTICE AND COMMENT RULEMAKING TO ESTABLISH NEW WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS. THAT ACCOUNT. MORE PRECISELY FOR CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE OR WHETHER A TOP BIOGRAPHY AND OUR DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. MEMBERS WITH CLIMATE CHANGE CREATING THE POTENTIAL FOR LONGER AND MORE SEVERE WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE IT IS IMPORTANT WE ACT NOW TO STRENGTHEN OUR LOCAL PLANNING. AND REDUCE THE RISK TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS COMMUNITIES AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. TRACY RYAN FROM THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND PAUL MASON. FROM PACIFIC FIVE FOUR STRUCTURE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR -- WHOSE FIRST GOOD AFTERNOON TRACY REINER OKAY REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIA -- AND I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR AND THAT CHAIR STAFF FOR WORKING. WITH US IN TRYING TO GET THIS BILL TO A PLACE THAT -- WE THINK THAT WILL HELP. THE WILD FIRE RISK IN -- BUILDING IN THOSE AREAS -- LAST YEAR WE WORKED A LOT ON WILD FIRE RISK AND IT REALLY FOCUSED MOSTLY ON VEGETATION VEGETATION FUEL MANAGEMENT -- THIS YEAR AND THIS BILL IN SB ONE EIGHTY TWO REALLY FOCUSES ON CREATING MORE FIRE SAFE COMMUNITIES AND CREATING MECHANISM TO ENFORCE -- COMMUNITY AN INDIVIDUAL HOME FIRE SAFETY. SB TWENTY TWO SETS FOR SPECIFIC WILDFIRE REDUCTION -- STANDARDS AND THOSE INCLUDE. CREATING SAFE AREAS AND COMMUNITIES FOR EVACUATION AND ALSO CREATING OPEN SPACE -- IN THOSE AREAS THAT DO NOT PERMIT PROMOTE THE SPREAD OF WILD FIRE. SB ONE EIGHTY TWO ALSO CREATES A STRUCTURE -- FOR INSURING COMMUNITY AND HOMEOWNER COMPLIANCE WITH DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT -- PRONGS ONE IS AN ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ENSURE THE DEFENSE WILL SPACES ACTUALLY BEING KEPT UP -- AND THAT IS THAT EVERY THREE YEARS AS THE SENATOR I REFERENCED. THE OTHER THING THAT IT TO THE OTHER PRONG WOULD BE -- AN H. O. EIGHT TYPE OF ASSESSMENT ON COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT THAT DEFENSE WILL SPACE IS MAINTAINED AND CREATES A KIND OF A A FINANCIAL STREAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONTINUES ON A COMMUNITY WIDE BASIS. THIS IS STRUCTURE CREATES A AWAY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO LOOK AT BUILDING IN THE WILD WILD FIRE I'M SORRY WELL THEN URBAN INTERFACE AREAS BY PROVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM APPROVING PERMITS FOR DEVELOPMENTS UNLESSTHE PROJECT MEETS. ALL OF THE COMPLIANCE WITH ALL THE WILD FIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS OUTLINED IN THE BILL -- WE BELIEVE THAT THAT CREATES -- BALANCE AND IT IS THERE'S A BALANCED LOOK AT THE WAY THESE DEVELOPMENTS WORK BY HAVING A TIERED STRUCTURE AS THAT SENATOR REFERENCE. NOT ALSO ALL DEVELOPMENTS ARE TREATED EQUALLY AND THE FIRE REDUCTION STANDARDS -- DIFFER FROM EACH TEAR IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED PLUS DEVELOPMENT THE FIRE REDUCTION STANDARDS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN. NINE IN THAT DEVELOPMENT. THE OTHER THING THAT SB ONE A TO ATTEMPT TO DO IS ON SILO THE CONVERSATION OF HOUSING NEEDS A AND WILD FIRE RISK IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL SAYS THAT ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT THE HOUSING ADDS THAT HOUSING HE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT -- AND THE COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO LOOK AT WHEN I'M DOING RIGHT NOW ALLOCATION IS. IS THE FACTOR OF OF WILDFIRE RISK IN THAT AREA. NOW I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR DID -- TAKING -- THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD REQUESTED IS REMOVING THE PROVISION THAT ACTUALLY LOWERS THE ALLOCATION OF REINA AND SO WHAT THIS SAYS WHAT THE BILL STILL CONTAINS IS JUST THAT IT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AS A FACTOR. AND IN LOOKING AT THE METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATION. WE BELIEVE BECAUSE OF THOSE STATING LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY -- BUT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE FIRE SEASONS -- THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE HOUSING NEEDS NOT IN THAT SILO LIKE I SAID BUT ALSO -- WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WILDFIRE IN THE HOUSING NEEDS TOGETHER AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. RE NOT BEING USED AS AS A WAY TO TIE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING GOING INTO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND WE JUST ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SORRY WE HAVE TWO MORE WITNESSES. ONE I'M SORRY ARE THERE WHY LEAN FROM OUR C. R. C.'S HERE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY. IT'S A TWO WITH TWO MINUTES IS OF A GREAT. HOMEMADE SOUPS OF THE FOREST TRUST MY CAN BE VERY BRIEF BECAUSE I WANT TO COMPLEX BILL. THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE REALLY PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD WE NEED TO BE SMARTER ABOUT BUILDING THESE REALLY HIGH RISK AREAS YOU KNOW AS WE'RE IF WE'RE GOING TO BUILD INTO AREAS WITH HIGH FIRE RISK. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS FOR ESTABLISHING SOME CONSISTENT MEDICATIONS. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MANAGING THOSE RISKS IN A CONSISTENT WAY ACROSS THE STATE. WE STRAIGHTFORWARD OF RACISM INTERESTING CHALLENGES AROUND THE RING THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF TIME ON YOU MAY ASK WHY PACIFIC FOREST TRUST WHICH MOSTLY WORKS ON FIRE NOT TO RESOURCE FOR TWO ISSUES. IS HERE BECAUSE THE FLIP SIDE OF THE HOUSING CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT WE KEEP BUILDING HOMES OUT INTO WILDLAND AREAS MAKES ALL OF OUR OTHER CHALLENGES WITH DEALING WITH FIRE WITH. FOREST MANAGEMENT WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO NEED TO BE ADDRESSING THIS FROM BOTH DIRECTIONS SO OVER SUPPORT OF THE BILL IN OUR DRIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY SORRY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION IF ANY AND THAT YOU SUPPORT. A LITTLE BIT OF A TWEENER TO BE HONEST. OKAY -- YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU CAN DO IT NOW OKAY AS ELEVEN SALAS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY FIRST OFF WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR JACKSON FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL. BUT WE DO AGREE WITH THE PERSPECTIVE THAT DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA -- WE NEED. TO SORRY WE NEED TO RETHINK THAT LAND USE POLICIES I HAVE PUT PEOPLE IN HARM'S WAY AND THAT THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION OWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUNDING. SPECIFICALLY USING TEACHER OFF THE HEALTHY FOREST FUNDS EXCLUSIVELY FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO FIND BOTH COMMUNITY PROTECTION. AND OF COURSE RESTORATION BUT WE THINK HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGEMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL OR ANY SUPPORTS. MYSTERON. MR MEMBERS JUST RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES THAT WERE BETWEEN -- AS WELL -- BUT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RAIN AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS CLARITY WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE STATE POLICY IS GOING TO BE -- BECAUSE WHEN WE GET OUR ARENA NUMBER THAT IS THEN IT DEMAND UPON OUR CITIES THE PLAN IN ZONE FOR THAT NUMBER OF HOUSING. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO CONSTRAIN WHERE WE CAN OR CAN'T OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO IDENTIFY SITES -- WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE NUMBER THAT THE STATE IS GIVING US -- SO WE CERTAINLY WANT TO WORK WITH THE CHAIRMAN WORK WITH THE AUTHOR I'M TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THAT SO THAT OUR CITIES UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY IS BEING DEMANDED BECAUSE ONCE WE ZONE IN PLAN. THE HOUSE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT APPLIES AND REQUIRES IS BY LAW TO APPROVE THIS PROJECT SO WE LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION LIKE TO CONTINUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY SUPPORT FOR THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. IS CRAIG THOMAS WITH THE FIRE RESTORATION GROUP WERE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF SENATOR JACKSON'S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE LAND USE PLANNING AND FIRE HAZARDS OWNS AND WE WANT TO SEE THE BILL. TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THE FUNDING COMES HOMES WE HAVE THE ONE CONCERN THAT SPENCER THE TNC TO IS A GT ARAFAT'S BUT OTHERWISE IT'S EXCELLENT EFFORT TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND HOUSING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AN ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. OKAY THREE NINE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WHAT INTERESTING CASES IN QUESTION? GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS NAY CAMERA OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION -- UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THIS BILL IS A HOUSING KILLER. I THINK THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE -- MULTIPLE I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA THAT WE HAVE. ON WHAT IS REQUIRED UNDER EXISTING LAW AND HELP THOSE HOMES AND SUBDIVISIONS SOME PROJECTS ARE PERFORMING. UNDER THAT EXISTING REGULATORY REGIME WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH OUR OWN ANALYSIS BUT ALSO. ALSO THROUGH -- WHAT'S BEEN PRESENTED IN THE PRESS AND OTHER MEDIA. THAT NEW HOMES ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST RESISTANCE TO WILDFIRES THEY ARE IN FACT DOING THEIR JOB. AND IT'S THE EXISTING POPULATION HAS THE BIGGEST RISKS OF WILDFIRE -- WE SAW THAT BOTH IN THE THOMAS FIRE AND HOW THAT AFFECTED HOMES IN. THE CITY OF VENTURA HOW THAT AFFECTED THE SANTA ROSA AREA COFFEE PARK THESE ARE IN FILL AREAS THESE ARE NOT JUST WHERE YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WE WE FOR MORE PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS BILL AND SAY. WE'RE TO SUPPLY AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THOSE AREAS SO -- IF WE CAN'T GET OUR HANDS AROUND THAT AND THEN IT'S REALLY FOR US THE RISK OF PLAYING GOTCHA WITH APPROVALS. AND FOR US THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK AREAS OF THOSE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY SOUNDS WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT THAT'S MAPPED THAT SET BY STATE AGENCIES WE KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT IT'S UPDATED REGULARLY AND SO WE KNOW. WHERE THOSE AREAS ARE BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE OTHER AREAS ADDITIONAL AREAS THAT ARE NOT FOUND IN THOSE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES? ADDED TO THAT YOU CAN SEE THIS IN THE DEFINITIONS THERE IN THE BILL. THIS IS ANY AREA WHERE STRUCTURE INTERMINGLED WITH BUDGET. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS THAT MEANS THAT IN ANY AREA WHERE THERE ARE TREES THERE BUSH'S THERE'S GRASS WITH THE YOU HAVE. PARKS OR YOU HAVE AN URBAN INFILL AREAS IN AREAS LIKE SACRAMENTO AND IN ALL OF YOUR COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE THESE AREAS. WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD HIGH DENSITY MULTI FAMILY HOUSING? NOW WE HAVE A NEW -- OBSTACLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH A NEW REASON FOR US TO HAVE OUR PROJECTS DENIED I THINK THAT THE BILL AS IT EXISTS IS OVERBROAD. I THINK THAT. YOU HAVE TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE LIKE YOU DO EVERY OTHER ISSUE WHICH IS THERE'S NO PERFECT PLACE TO BUILDING CALIFORNIA FOR SOME. IT'S WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE -- DISPLACEMENT WE DON'T WANT HAVE GENTRIFICATION WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEISMIC CARESS WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE. THE SEA LEVEL RISE OR WETLANDS OR AG LAND PRESERVATION OR FLOODS OR TOXICS FOR YOU NAME IT WHATEVER THE THE THE PARTICULAR INTEREST IS. THAT'S THE REASON FOR OBJECTING TO HOUSING IN EVERY PLACE THE ENTIRE STATE IS COVERED WITH. HAVING IN PERFECT PLACES TO BUILD AND SO DON'T MAKE THE PERFECT THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. THAT'S HOW WE GOT INTO THIS MESS IN TERMS OF A HOUSING CRISIS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR HOUSING. SO MUCH FOR THE PLACES WHERE IT MIGHT APPLY. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THOSE AREAS I CAN TELL YOU AS A LAND USE AN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYER FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS I CAN'T TELL? WE'VE SINCE THAT SINCE I COULDN'T TELL I IN BUT WE WENT OUT AND TALKED TO EXPERTS. THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO TELL US WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WE NEED TO KNOW FROM A PLANNING A DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IN THOSE AREAS. ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WAS TAKEN IN SENATE GOVERNANCE OF FINANCE PROVIDED SOME. THE SIDE BOARDS TO WHAT MIGHT BE IMPOSED ARE PROJECTS. IT WILL ONLY APPLY ONLY APPLIES TO THE SMALL DEVELOPMENTS NINE HOMES ARE FEWER. HERE'S WHAT IT IS. THEY HAVE TO BE REASONABLE. FEASIBLE AND THE CHIEF OF ALL. IF THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR NINE HOMES IT SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANY PROJECT WE SET LIMITS ON HOW WE DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. WE DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES THEY HAVE TO BE ACHIEVABLE. NOW WE'RE SAYING EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT ACHIEVABLE EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT FEASIBLE EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT REASONABLE. WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED OPPOSE THOSE ON NEW HOUSING PROJECTS. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY GOTCHA THEN THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. SO WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AT THIS POINT IS. TO MAKE PROVIDES SOME LIMITATIONS ON THOSE. THOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL BE IMPOSED ON US EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY ARE. JUST SOME LIMITATION TO PROVIDE THAT BALANCE THAT WE NEED. OTHERWISE IT'S JUST A NO HOUSING BILL. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SIGNAL BRING ABOUT THE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER LIKE HEALTHY. ON THE HARDENING OF THE EXISTING STRUCTURES AND THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS NORMALLY THEY ASSESS IF THEY'RE IN THE IF THEY'RE IN THE HIGH -- FIREFIGHT -- AREA I I PREDICT PRISON THIRST WAS TO MEET NEW EXCEED BILL A CLASS B. STANDARDS TO HARDEN THEIR ASSETS SOME WONDERING IS THAT A HOMEOWNER. PAYMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THAT THE TO IMPROVE DEBTORS AT HERE IS A ANTICIPATION THAT IT'S PART OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS FOR FUNDING THIS I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT IF WE'VE TOTALLY IDENTIFIED THE SOURCES OF FUNDING. THAT WILL BE USED FOR THIS -- BUT WHAT WERE TRUE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND I WAS LISTENING. TO BUILDING INDUSTRIES HOUSING KILLER TO NEW PHRASE TO ME I KNOW THE CHAMBER LIKE JOB KILLER. NUMBER CLINCH BUT I'M REALLY NOT SURE EVEN UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS. COMPLAINING ABOUT HER BUT BUT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE IS A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE TRYING. TO IDENTIFY THOSE RISK AREAS. AND BY THE WAY SACRAMENTO UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN ONE'S WILDEST IMAGINATION WITH ANYONE CALL IT A WEEK. WHO IS IN LAGUNA MIGUEL OR WHERE THE MOUNTAINS COME DOWN TO THE HILLS THE COME DOWN? TO TO THE YEAR IT TO THE BEACH AREAS SO SINCE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PRIMARILY OF THE BERKELEY HILLS. SACRAMENTO LAST I LOOKED AT HIM FONG TOO MANY HILLS THERE'S NO MOVIE HERE SO THOSE. ARGUMENTS JUST REALLY. DON'T HOLD WATER -- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS WHICH ARE AT HIGH RISK AND MAKE SURE THAT IN THOSE AREAS WE HARDEN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES? WILL MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT IT IS SAID TO EXPECTED WHAT IS REQUIRED GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOW SEEING THESE FIRES HAPPENING IN DECEMBER. BURNING AT SIXTEEN HUNDRED DEGREES THINGS THAT WE NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH BEFORE AND SO AS WE BUILD WHETHER IT'S NEW HOUSING WELL WE TRY TO HARDEN EXISTING HOUSING. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BRING TOGETHER? THE PLANNING -- AGENCIES THROUGHOUT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND REQUIRING THAT THEY ASSESS THIS ISSUE AND CREATE THE STANDARDS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REQUIRE. THOSE WHO LIVE IN THOSE AREAS. TO TO DEVELOP IN ORDER TO DEAL. WITH THE REALITIES OF THE ALL OF THE POTENTIAL FIRE SO AS FAR AS THE FUNDING MECHANISM GOES WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T QUITE BEEN ABLE. TO WORK THAT OUT I KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR ADDRESSING THESE WILDFIRES AND THIS IS AN AREA. THAT HAS BEEN LEFT. BUT THERE'S A VOID IN THIS AREA PLANNING. AND WHAT WE ARE DOING INDEED IS TALKING TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND SAYING HEY FOLKS TO GO TO STEP UP HERE WE CAN'T TRUST. YOU KNOW CLEAN OUT OUR FORESTS WE CAN'T ADJUST TO PRESCRIBE BURNS WE CAN'T DO THE THINGS THAT WE IN LEGISLATION WE DID LAST YEAR THAT'S PART OF THE ANSWER BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE BUILDING. AND TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO HARDEN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROTECT HMAN LIFE. AND PROPERTY YEAH I I THINK IF I'M MISTER CHAIR IS THAT IF I A WITH WITH REGARD TO THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS THE ASSOCIATION'S CANNOT STOP YOU FROM ALTERING YOUR CHANGING YOUR ROOF IN ORDER TO HARDEN NET. RIGHT ISN'T THAT A PROVISION OF THE OF THE AT ALL CORRECT BUT THERE'S SOME OF THE I GUESS COMMON AREAS THAT ARE THAT ARE IN THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION -- RIGHT IN A CLUB. ROOM OVER WHATEVER IS EVERYBODY SHARES ON OUR DOES. THAT'S MY QUESTION THE SAID ARE THOSE -- HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION IMPROVEMENTS IN A FIFTY DECIDED IF THEY MAKE THE STEP THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT THAT'S I DON'T EXPECT AN ANSWER HERE BUT I I SEE THE GOOD PART IS SAID. IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THE SEVENTY HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION THAT'S SHAKE ROOF AND SHAKE CITING YOU CAN'T MAKE IN SAY THAT'S OUR RULES YOU GOT A YOU GOT TO HAVE THAT THAT'S A CRAZY THING. NOWADAYS SO I ASSUME THAT CORRECT SET WELL AGE IT'S DESIGNED TO I MEAN WE'RE TRIP A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT DO I DO TO PROTECT MY HOME. IN CASE OF A WILDFIRE IN ANOTHER ELEMENT BY THE WAY WHICH WILL FURTHER INCENTIVIZE SIS IS TRYING TO GET INSURANCE. WHEN YOU LIVE IN A HIGH FIRE AREA AND HAS SO I WAS JUST TWO MONTHS AGO NON RENEWED -- FOR INSURANCE AND WE HAD TO GO OUT AND THE COST OF THAT NEW INSURANCE. BECOMES. A CHALLENGE BUT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO SAY YOU NEED TO DO A. B. C. AND D.. IF YOU WANT TO OUR INSURANCE AND EVEN THEN AGAIN WITHOUT TAKING THOSE MITIGATION MEASURES GIVEN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE THOUSANDS OF HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST AND THE ENORMOUS COST. TO EVERYBODY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY PROBABLY P. JEANNIE AND OTHERS IS SUCH THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE SOME OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY SO I'M ASSUMING THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. WE'LL GET OFF THE YOU KNOW WE'LL GET ON BOARD AS WELL JUST BECAUSE THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH NOT DOING THAT WORK WILL BE SIGNIFICANT. ONE WOULD HOPE AND I MISTER CHAIR ONE FINAL QUESTION THE STAFF REPORT AT PAGE FOUR IS TALKING ABOUT THE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SOUNDS. FIRST WHICH I ASSUME ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE HI FIRES ZONES VERSUS THE JUST THE FIRE SEVERITY SO AND SO ARE WE IS THAT. WHAT TYPE OF UNIVERSES THAT WELL UNFORTUNATELY -- THEY THE THE MAPS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE I THINK IT'S TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR I AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE AREAS. GIVEN THE CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS GIVING GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD DROUGHT THAT THOSE NEED TO BE DRAMATICALLY NEED TO BE UPDATED AND UPGRADED BECAUSE YES THE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE CAN WHAT'S A CHALLENGE ANYWAY BETWEEN EARTHQUAKES AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT SOME AREAS ARE CLEARLY MORE PRONE. TO PROBLEMS IN THE MOVIES ARE THOSE AREAS. IF YOU JUST LIVE ANYWHERE. NEAR THE WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE -- YOU ARE YOU ARE SHOULD MORE SUSCEPTIBLE AS COMPARED TO THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WHICH IS. NOT IN A WEEK. YOU SEE MY CONCERN IS YES JUST TO DO A MOVIE VERSUS THE VERY SAYS. SUPPORT SUPER HIGH -- AREAS ON THESE COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT I DON'T WANT. TO WELL PART OF IT PART OF IT IS WE NEED NO ONE'S BEEN DOING ANY PLANNING -- AND SO THIS IS GOING TO GET US TO DO THE PLANNING FISH ARE BELIEVED BENEFITS EVERYBODY I EVEN THINK IT BENEFITS THE BUILDING INDUSTRY BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE PERSON'S MEETS ANOTHER PERSON'S POTATO SEVERAL. GIVE A UP. A POTENTIAL NUMBER OF RESIDENTS THIS WILL -- AFFECT. AT THIS TIME -- OR POTENTIALLY HOW MANY -- POTENTIAL BUILDINGS -- PROJECTS WILL AFFECT WILL AREAS I SHOULD SAY -- WE'RE LOOKING MORE TO ADD GEOGRAPHY HOW MANY HOW MANY AREAS ARE THERE IN THE STATE LIKE AT THAT HAVE LOUISE BE OUR SQUARE MILES GIVES THEM. HAVE YOU ARE YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR THEN I TAKE A I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER OKAY OKAY BOERNER HORVATH. A YOUNG FIVE ACTUALLY LIVE I THINK ANY LAWYER SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT AND ARE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION IS REQUIRED BY THE FIRE AT THE READY. TO DO CERTAIN THINGS WITCHER'S FUEL MODIFICATION WE HAVE A WHOLE PLAN ON THE BACK PART OF OUR HOME AND WE LIVED A. G. SENT TO THE CANYON. THAT THANK GOODNESS FOR THE CANYON OF STOP THE LAGUNA FIRES FROM LEAPING THE CANYON COMING OVER SO. THE IDEAS ARE GOOD AT I JUST WONDER WHY YOU WOULD BE RESISTANT TO TAKING THEY AMENDMENT. THAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED BY A ON THE B. I A THAT IS REASONABLE. FEASIBLE -- FORGET THE OTHER TURN THE REASON BEING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE VERY GOOD AT USING THAT DISCRETION TO PROTECT. THOSE HOMES IN THEIR AREA AND I I THINK MY HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION AN ORANGE COUNTY IN PARTICULAR. HAS BEEN VERY DILIGENT IN MATH BUT TO MAKE IT SO RESTRICTIVE FOR THE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS I THINK THE I A HAS A GOOD POINT. THAT WE START TO TO NARAL -- THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE FOR BUILDING DURING THE HOUSING CRISIS. BEYOND -- DOUBT THAT TROUBLES ME BECAUSE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TO DO WHAT. IS BEING REQUIRED IN THE US. AND THE NEWER DEVELOPMENTS SEE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND ALLOWING THAT SORT OF DISCRETION THAT'S MENTIONED IN LET ME GET THE TERMINOLOGY CORRECT IT SAYS. REASONABLE FEASIBLE AND ACHIEVABLE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPLIED -- FOR MANY OF THE HOMES THAT WERE BUILT IN REMEMBER IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE TWO MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. RANCHO MISSION VIEJO AND THEN WE HAVE -- FORSTER RANCH AND THEN THERE'S ONE IN ON THE LAKE FOREST WHERE BY THE WAY THE FIRES AN ORANGE COUNTY DURING ON THE MID TWO THOUSANDS CAME OVER. THOSE CANYONS BUT AGAIN THOSE HOUSES WERE HARD. SO YOU HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALREADY DOING IT IN GOING FORWARD IT WOULD SEEM TO ME YOU WANT TO PROVIDE. MORE DISCRETION TO GET THOSE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTACHED -- MULTI FAMILY IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR OUR DEATHS SO I I'M I GUESS MY MY QUESTION IS MORE OF A STATEMENT SENATOR JACKSON. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND MAYBE CONSIDER THAT OUT FOR THE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE I THINK IT CAN BE ACHIEVED. OUR I'VE JUST SEEN IT HAPPEN THEN WE WENT THROUGH SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. OUR TIME IS AN ORANGE COUNTY DURING MY ROLE ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IT WAS IN MY DISTRICT AND I THINK SOME OF US SENATOR MORE WALKS ARE COMING DOWN. TO IRVINE SO I TAKE A LOOK AT THAT I THINK TODAY I'M GOING -- TO OPPOSE THE BILL JUST TO PUT MORE PRESSURE TO TAKE A LOOK AT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR LARGER DEVELOPMENT SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE THE BILL. RELIES ON CONSENSUS NATIONAL AND STATE ADVISORY STANDARDS. FOR A PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL. PROMULGATES APPROPRIATE STANDARDS WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE REAL EXPERTS TO DECIDE AND AND TO CREATE THE STANDARDS. AND THEY WILL BE CONSENSUS ADVISORY STANDARDS -- WHICH WILL RELY. ON SIGNIFICANT INPUT FROM ISSUE EXPERTS SO WE WERE DECISION PIE IN THE SKY THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE AND AND USE THE BEST EXPERTS TO TRY -- TO ESTABLISH THOSE STANDARDS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS I MEAN THIS IS PART OF THEIR PLAN. BUT OFTEN WE OF THE STANDARDS THAT ARE USED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE THE STANDARDS BUT WE WANT THESE TO BE. INSTEAD OF A BROAD BASED OF REASONABLENESS SO WE CERTAINLY CAN KEEP WORKING ON THAT BUT THE GOAL IS GET THE EXPERTS IN THERE. GET THEM TO TELL US WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND A LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO WILL HOPEFULLY. RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF USING THE STANDARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE EXPERTS. WELL I JUST I RESPOND THAT BEST PRACTICES ARE ALREADY IN PRACTICE AND I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED OUT SO WE DON'T PUT SOME ARBITRARY. TIONS ON THE SIZE OF THE DEVELOPMENT WHEN THAT SEES SENSUALLY WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO HELP PEOPLE FOR COMMUNITIES TO MEET THE RENOWNED. SO I THINK THEY'RE SO I I JUST THINK WITHIN AND YOU'VE GOT CONFLICTS THAT ALMOST DEFEAT ONE ANOTHER AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IT JUST KIND OF REFLECTS THAT AS I READ IT. AND HAVING HAD THE EXPERIENCE FRANKLY WE HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED FUEL MODIFICATIONS ON DOZEN AND JOB LEAVE ME I'D LOVE TO PLANT A LOT MORE STUFF IN MY FUEL MINES ON BUT I CAN'T. AND NOW I KNOW WHY AND I'M I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WE ALSO A PAY MORE. FOR A FIRE INSURANCE AND WE WE ARE IN AN S. R. A.. M. DOUBTS BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S COORDINATED THROUGH THE FIRE AUTHORITY ORANGE COUNTY I I DON'T THINK WE'RE THAT FAR OFF YOUR MAYBE IT'S JUST THE EMPHASIS IS ON A DIFFERENT SOLANO. LANGUAGE WHEN IT GETS RIGHT TO RIGIDLY THEN YOU DO RIGHT EXACTLY WHAT -- THE V. I. IS TALKING ABOUT THAT USE THEIR FREE THOUGH FORWARD YOU KNOW LITIGATION ALL OUT SAID CERTAINLY ISN'T THE INTENT AND I DON'T. BELIEVE THAT. THE ARMENIAN TURPIN TATIAN WE'RE SEEING IS NOT ONE THAT I SHARE BUT CERTAINLY THE INTENT IS NOT TO LIMIT -- BUT IT'S TO PROTECT AND TO CREATE THE THE THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE CAN TO PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY. AYE AYE HI I KNOW THAT SECURITY AND I'M JUST SAYING TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. OKAY INTERNATIONAL CENTER COVER ERA MY APOLOGIES. PICTURE -- YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS SENATOR BATES -- SENATOR JACKSON NIGHT THERE WERE THERE WERE TWO THINGS THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME WHEN I WHEN I READ THIS AND AND BOTH OF THEM REALLY GO TOGETHER ONE WAS THE THE RENO WHAT NUMBER DISCUSSION -- AT A I GET THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT. THE PUBLIC LIFE AND LIMB -- BUT TO ABSOLVE THE THE ENTITY. THAT HAS AN OBLIGATION TO BUILD HOUSING BECAUSE THEY HAVE PROPERTY THAT ARE THAT ARE PART OF A MOVIE -- I THINK IS IS -- IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT YOUR PURPOSE HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET RID OF THAT BUT I ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IF IT I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE OUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE I'M. STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- MOVING FORWARD WHETHER I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT. THAT IT IT WON'T SHOW BACK UP AGAIN BUT I JUST IF AND FRANKLY FRANKLY -- I I GET SUSPICIOUS WHEN PEOPLE START. TINKERING WITH THE READING NUMBER EVEN AS AS BAD AS THE SYSTEM IS IT'S THE ONLY SYSTEM WE HAVE. AND IF WE'RE NOT BUILDING HOUSING THEN WE'RE WE'RE EXACERBATING THE GREENHOUSE GAS. RIDDICK REDUCTION EFFORTS THAT WE HAVEN'T AND WE'RE ALSO IT IT IT JUST. IT FORCES PEOPLE INTO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD THE COST WE DID TAKE THE AMENDMENT THAT SAYS IT'S A NET ZERO CHOSE TO CLARIFY THAT AMENDMENT -- IF WE DID TAKE THAT -- BECAUSE THAT ISN'T THE INTENT HERE THE INTENT IS SHOWS TO BE RESPECTFUL. OF THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WITH LOUISE AND TO TRY -- TO A SURE THAT WE DON'T PEOPLE AT IN HARM'S WAY BY BUILDING IN AREAS WHERE IT IS DANGEROUS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT ATTEMPTING AND NOT -- REDUCING THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE UNDER A WRITTEN. TO THE RENEWAL REQUIREMENTS SO WE DID TAKE THAT IS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE HERE WHEN WE TOOK THAT FIRST AMENDMENT AND AS FAR AS THE LANGUAGE TO BALANCE THIS OUT. THE KIND OF PERMIT UP IS TO SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING ON AND THEN THE THE OTHER THE OTHER PART REALLY HAD TO DO WITH THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT PART OF IT WHICH IS THAT -- THERE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE UNSPECIFIED SET ASIDE SIDE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR CALIFORNIA FOR GRANTS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES -- AND WHILE I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA THAT WE WE HARDEN -- THE SAFETY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOING. WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO ROADS OUT WATER SUPPLY -- IF THERE'S A NEED FOR REMOTE INFRARED CAMERAS THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING IT AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I GOT A LOT OF REQUESTS FROM. ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN MY DISTRICT THIS YEAR FOR FIRE IN FIRE -- STATIONS POLICE STATIONS. LIBRARIES PARKS AND QUITE FRANKLY MOST OF MY COMMUNITIES ARE BLUE COLLAR POOR COMMUNITIES AND THEY PUT THAT ON AS FEES AS PART OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. SO I'M I I LOOK AT THE AT THIS AND SAY WHY WOULDN'T LOCAL GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THIS OR WHY WOULDN'T THAT. THE THE FEES IT PEOPLE PAY TO LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT CENTER BATES TALKED ABOUT THEIR THEIR HOMEOWNERSASSOCIATION IS IS -- TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR DOING THIS THIS KIND OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS SO WHY WOULD WE WANT THE STATE TO PAY FOR SOME OF THIS -- OR YEAH I GET WHAT WAS SOME OF THE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE AREAS IN THE MOVIE IN MY OWN DISTRICT THAT WOULD THERE'S ONLY ONE ACCESS EGRESS AND INGRESS. AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD THAT THAT ADDITIONAL ACCESS SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN PARADISE THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM AND THEY EITHER DIDN'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO BUILD. ANOTHER WAY OUT OR FOR REASONS THAT WE NOW LOOK BACK AND HINDSIGHT WERE MORE FOOLISH ONCE THEY DID NOT DO SO. SO THAT'S PART OF THE THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IS THERE. IS THERE SUFFICIENT INGRESS OR EGRESS OF THE PEOPLE GET OUT IF THEY HAVE. TO DO WE HAVE ENOUGH -- WATER SUPPLY DO WE HAVE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO PUMP THE WATER. IF IF IT'S NECESSARY IN THOSE AREAS THESE ARE ALL QUESTIONS THAT THAT WE NEED TO ASK IN THAT. WE FRANKLY HAVE NOT DONE A REAL GOOD JOB. ADDRESSING THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WHEN WE SEE. YOU KNOW ALL THE FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE IN THE INABILITY WE'VE HAD TO FIGHT THEM BECAUSE THE LOOK OF THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE -- SO AGAIN -- BUILDING A FIRE STATION IS ONE THING AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO YOU CAN DO CERTAIN THINGS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE. BUILDING OR WHEN YOU'RE ADDRESSING -- POPULATIONS IN THAT WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE THE ANSWERS AREN'T ALWAYS SO SIMPLE. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE TO START LOOKING AT WHERE WE ARE BUILDING BECAUSE THE COST. OF PUTTING IN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE PROHIBITIVE. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER PEOPLE ARE PAYING FEES ARE NOT. I THINK -- THERE ALSO. THANK YOU CHAIR -- I NOT SURE I'M I'M MAY BE MISSING SOMETHING HERE IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE ISSUES A BEEN BROUGHT UP. WE'RE TASKED WITH FIGURING OUT HOW TO ADJUST THE WAY WE DO THINGS. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS THIS ENVIRONMENTAL GLOBAL. ISSUE MORE MEAN ISSUE. AND WE CAN DO THINGS THE SAME WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THEM FOR AND THEY THEY MIGHT HAVE. MET A CERTAIN NEED BEFORE. BUT THEY'RE NOT MEETING THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE ANYMORE. SO I UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE FRUSTRATING FOR THE BUILDING -- INDUSTRY. BUT IF WE DON'T MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE WAY WE DO THINGS IN THE FUTURE AS FAR AS BUILDING WHERE WE SHOULD OR BUILDING WHERE WE SHOULD AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO FACE THE SAME. CRISIS IS GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE SO. I'M NOT SURE IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING BUT I THINK THAT YOU HAVE ADDRESSED THE ISSUES AS FAR AS WHERE WE NEED TO PLAN THIS IS ABOUT PLANNING AHEAD. AND NOT JUST REACTING WE HAVE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THOSE MEN AND WOMEN AND FAMILIES WHO SUFFERED EITHER BECAUSE THEY LOST SOMEONE THEY LOST THEIR HOMES. I MEAN THE THERE IS JUST NUMEROUS PROBLEMS AND ISSUES AND SUFFERING THAT HAVE HAPPENED. NOW WE WANT TO SORT OF A JUST TO SAY THOSE TWO THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT HERE WHILE NOT FORGETTING THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BILLS SO -- YOU CERTAINLY HAVE ANSWERED ALL OF MY QUESTIONS AND I THINK YOU'VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF MONTH. COLLEAGUES ANY ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SO I WANT. TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US AND JUST TO GIVE -- SIR PUBLICLY SAY WHAT WORK WITH MY PERSPECTIVE IS ON ON THIS AND THIS IS NOTHING THAT -- THE AUTHOR HASN'T. HEARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ON HI -- I AGREED THAT WE NEED TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN TERMS OF WHERE WE BUILD AND THERE ARE AREAS. WHERE WE SHOULD -- BE PULLING BACK ON IT WAS A TOUCHY AREA BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING. IN IN THESE AREAS ON BUT IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE TO JUST CONTINUE PUT MORE MORE HOUSING IN THESE HIGH RISK. AREAS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE CALIFORNIA HAS A THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOME DOT HOUSING DEFICIT. I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE AND I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT IT'S SORT OF EXTRAORDINARY OUR HOUSING DEFICIT OF THREE MILLION HOMES. IS EQUAL TO THE HOUSING DEFICIT AND THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES COMBINED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOMES PER CAPITA? CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY NINE OUT OF FIFTY SAY THAT AGAIN CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY NINE OUT OF FIFTY IN HOMES PER CAPITA THE ONLY STATE THAT IS LOWER. IS THE STATE OF UTAH -- WHEN I'M SPECULATING THAT THEY HAVE LARGER HOUSEHOLD SIZES AND THAT'S WHY OTHERWISE WE WOULD PROBABLY BE FIFTY OUT OF? FIFTY AND SO AS WE START THINKING ABOUT OKAY ARE THERE AREAS WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO BUILD HOUSING ANYMORE. WE HAVE WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THAT SIDE OF THE EQUATION WE HAVE TO SAY OKAY WHERE ARE WE GOING. TO BUILD THE HOUSE AND THAT'S WHY I DID HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THIS IS PHRASED IN TERMS OF POTENTIALLY LOWERING RINA ALLOCATIONS. IN CITIES. AND WITHOUT SAYING OKAY WHERE ELSE IN YOUR CITY ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD OKAY YOU HAVE A PROBLEM AREA HERE BUT YOU CAN DO MORE HERE AND MAYBE. THAT AND THE OTHER PIECE OF IT -- IS THAT WE KNOW HAVING GONE THROUGH THE RENO PROCESS AND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO THE RE IN A PROCESS. ONE OF THE WORST. ONE OF THE WORST PARTS OF THE RENO PROCESS. IS THAT CITIES THAT ARE WEALTHIER AND MORE POWERFUL. SHOW OF MAUREEN OBLIGATION AND THE CITIES THAT ARE LOWER INCOME AND LESS POWERFUL IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY IT'S BEEN WITH RINA -- AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT -- IS -- FOR WHEN WE SAY THE COGS YOU CAN DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE A IT HAS TO BE CABINS. SO WE DON'T HAVE AREAS THAT ARE MORE POWERFUL PUSHING HOUSING AND OTHER AREAS TO THOSE OF THE THE CONCERNS THAT. ON THAT I'VE HAD -- AND THAT'S WHY WE AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR GREEN TO THE PLEASE HOLD A LANGUAGE SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THAT ISSUE AND I'M CONFIDENT WE'LL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE RESOLUTION -- AND THE FINAL POINT I MAKE IS -- YOUR WU WE WE ARE WHY I HATE THAT WORD WHILE IN URBAN INTERFACE IS GOING TO SAY IT THAT WAY. THE WAY YOU DO IT IS A IS A REALLY REALLY REALLY BROAD. GEOGRAPHY OF WHOLE BUNCH OF CALIFORNIA IS A WEILAND URBAN INTERFACE. NOW WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE -- FIVE DEGREES OF WILDLIFE OF WILDLIFE WILD FIRE HAZARD -- WE HAVE MAPS OF THE VERY HIGH RISK HIGH RISK AND SO FORTH I SAID I NEED TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO NOT ALL. WE WE IS CREATED EQUAL -- SO LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION IN THE COMING WEEKS -- AND AGAIN THANK YOU THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US AND SOMETIME CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL. DOES NOT BAN HOUSING IN FIRE PRONE AREAS OF THE STATE. IT ONLY REQUIRES THAT HIGH STANDARDS FOR HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DESIGN IN FOR A MERCHANT SEE RESPONSE. BE MAD IN ORDER FOR NEW HOUSING TO PROCEED SO THAT WE THAT WE TAKE THE STEPS THAT WE KNOW WE SHOULD BE TAKING TO PROTECT. WHERE WE BUILD FROM THE REALITIES OF THE WILDFIRES THAT WE'VE HAD AND THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE GOING FORWARD SO -- I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THAT IT IT IS. AN INFORMATION AND EDUCATION AND A PROTECTION -- MEASURE BUT IT'S NOT AN EXCLUSION. MEASURE AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT -- LANGUAGE GOING FORWARD WE WANT TO LOCAL PLANNING TO INCLUDE THIS AND NOT TO IGNORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS -- THERE'S NO DESIRE THERE'S NO INTENT TO REDUCE THE RENO ALLOCATIONS US WILL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT. THIS BILL TRULY IS A BILL. THAT IT ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CREATE SO. WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS A HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS AGAIN THE SPIRIT OF THIS BILL. IS NOT THE KILL HOUSING. THE THE SPUR THIS BILL IS SO THAT WHILE FAR DON'T KILL PEOPLE. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DO I HAVE A MOTION TO PASS THE BILL AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. BY SENATOR WHY CAL SKI AND WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS ISN'T A BILL ONE EIGHTY TWO BY SENATOR JACKSON THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. SENATOR WIENER HI WIENER AYE MORALE. BROWN NO BATES. BATES SNOW COVER GIRL. I DRAWS -- DRAWS -- BY MCGUIRE. MORE LOCK. MARK NO ROUGH PROFIT BY SKINNER. UMBERG CASKEY. OKAY CI. OKAY THE VOTER FIVE THE THREE WILL KEEP THE ROLE OF AMBER ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CENTER JACKSON YOU HAVE A SECOND -- BILL THAT IS. ITEM NUMBER FOUR SP. TWO EIGHTY I HOPE THIS ONE GOES A LOT FASTER. THIS IS A THE BILL THERE WERE CALLING THE DIGNITY AT HOME ACT SB. TWO EIGHTY SIX TO ALLOW MORE SENIORS AND DISABLED DISABLED INDIVIDUALS TO AGE IN PLACE. AND STAY IN THEIR OWN HOMES THROUGH THE USE OF HOME MODIFICATIONS. THAT REDUCE THE RISK OF FALLING. A THOUSAND PEOPLE EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA TODAY ARE TURNING SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER OR TURN SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE. ADULTS INVOLVED HAZARDS AT HOME. ACTORS LIKE POOR LIGHTING LOOSE CARPETS AND A LACK OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT THINGS LIKE GRAB BARS STAIR RAILS. IN HIGH TOILETS ARE EXAMPLES -- ARE A BRITISH PARTICULAR RISKS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THOSE AVAILABLE. 80% OF FALLS HAPPENED BY THE WAY IN THESE HOMES IN THE BATHROOM. SO WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO TO PREVENT AGAINST THIS. AND SB TWO EIGHTY DOES TWO THINGS TO HELP SENIORS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES MAKE THEIR HOME SAFER. AND PLACES THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE THEM FOR YEARS TO COME FIRST THIS AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. TO ISSUE GRANTS TO LOCAL. ELEVEN AREA AGENCIES ON AGING FOR INJURY PREVENTION SERVICES IN THE HOME. THESE GRANTS CAN BE USED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AROUND THE HOME FOR THE ADDITION OF GRAB BARS FOR EXAMPLE OR IMPROVE LIGHTING OR SIMPLE THINGS SUCH AS SIMPLY TACKING A RUN DOWN. SO THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T SLIP AND FALL THE SMALL IMPROVEMENTS CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE FOR MANY OLDER ADULTS BETWEEN AGING IN PLACE AND FACING A FUTURE OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION. 50% OF PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR FALLS AFTER HIS SENIORS DO NOT EVER GET TO COME HOME AGAIN. SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A SMALL -- FINANCIAL COST THAT IS GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACTS FOR SENIORS AND ARE DISABLED COMMUNITY THIS BILL. DOT MEASURES UP THIS BILL ALSO ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DURING ITS NEXT TRIENNIAL RULEMAKING CYCLE TO CONSIDER SOME BUILDING STANDARDS CHANGES. INCLUDING ADDING THINGS LIKE A WIDENED DOORWAY IN ONE BEDROOM AND ONE BATHROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR RELOCATING DOORBELLS LIGHT SWITCHES AND HEATING VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING CONTROLS SO THAT THE REACHABLE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS. AND THE ADDITION OF SUPPORT BACKING FOR THE FUTURE INSTALLATION OF GRAB BARS IN ONE OR MORE BATHROOMS. SIMPLE SIMPLE ITEMS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS POSITIVE IMPACT ON ALLOWING OUR SENIORS TO AGE IN PLACE. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FACILITIES EVEN TO DAY FOR OUR AGING POPULATION AND CALIFORNIA IS AN AGING STATE WE WILL HAVE FOUR MILLION MORE SENIORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BAR I BELIEVE IT'S THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GOAL AS SENIORS. IF WE SUFFER THESE KINDS OF EVENTS THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AGING HOME IN OUR HOME SO WITH THAT I HAVE LAUREN WILL FOR PRESENTING THE BILL'S SPONSOR. THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE. AS WELL AS MAXINE MAN TELL FROM THE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY. I THANK YOU OF REACH WITNESS I WOULD ASK THAT YOU KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO ABOUT THREE MINUTES. OKAY -- I'D LIKE TO SAY TO THE COMMITTEE MY PASSION. FOR FALLS PREVENTION. A STEM FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH MY STEP MOTHER WHO HAD A SERIOUS FALL. AND SHE HAD TO STAY IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND REHAB FACILITY FOR MANY MONTH. BECAUSE SHE KNEW SHE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR BUT SHE COULDN'T GET INTO HER HOUSE. AND I COULDN'T EVEN BRING HER INTO MY HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW HER TO RECOVER THEIR AND TAKE HER TO THE TERM ROCK. REHAB -- GIVEN CUT CALIFORNIA'S NEED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE AVAILABLE HOUSING. IT'S A PERFECT TIME FOR THE STATE TO MAKE THAT HOUSING MORE AGE AND DISABILITY FRIENDLY. BY INCORPORATING FALLS PREVENTION OR SPECIFIC ACCESSIBLE FEATURES INTO THE STATE BUILDING STANDARDS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA HOUSING. MAKING THESE CHANGES WILL ALLOW RESIDENTS TO STAY IN THEIR HOME IS A AGE AND ALLOW FAMILIES TO EASILY BRING ELDER MEMBERS ENTER THEIR HOME. AS THEY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. POLICY FEATURES CAN BE MUCH LESS COSTLY WHEN BUILT INTO THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE HOUSING. A DEVELOPMENT AN INDIVIDUAL HOMES RATHER THAN TO RETROFIT EXISTING HOMES AT A TIME WHEN -- CALIFORNIANS ARE AGING RETIRING HAVE LESS INCOME. THE COST OF APPS GOD DOING A REHABILITATION LOAN IS EXORBITANT. NEXT TO THE COST OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO PUT THESE PUT THESE. AMENDMENTS INTO THE INTO THE BUILDING AT THE TIME THAT IT'S BEING BUILT -- QUESTED FEATURES IN SB TWO EIGHTY WILL NOT SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTLY CHANGE THE LOOK OR THE COST OF BUILDING THE HOUSE. CREATING FOREVER HOMES FOR CALIFORNIA CAN ALSO PRESERVE WEALTH SO THAT CALIFORNIANS WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY AS A AGE. BY NOT HAVING TO MOVE WHEN THEIR PHYSICAL ABILITIES ECOME REDUCED AND HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HAVE THE HELP THAT THEY NEED AS THEY AGE. CALIFORNIA HAS TO IMPENDING CRISES. ONE IS THE LACK OF HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE FOR YOUNG AND OLD CALIFORNIANS A LIGHT. THE SECOND IS HOW WILL WE PAY FOR THE MEDICAL. IN HOME CARE NEEDS OF OUR SENIOR POPULATION. MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL USE MEDICARE. AS A PART OF AT THE RECOVERY OR THEIR ON GOING CARE. AND IF THEY HAVE A FALL AND IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO LIVE IN THEIR HOMES OTHERWISE. SHOULDN'T WE BE LOOKING AT INSURING THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE SAFELY IN THEIR HOUSES FOR LONGER. AND AND THAT FAMILIES CAN AFFORD TO CARE FOR THEIR AGING RELATIVES IN THEIR HOMES. RATHER THAN BE FORCED TO SEND THEM TO MEDI CAL PAID SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. IN THE EFFORT TO INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE STATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO MAKE SMART DECISIONS. ABOUT CREATING HOUSING THAT LASTS FOR SENIORS FAMILIES AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MAXINE MAN TALENT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY. SB TWO EIGHTY IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MS IS A CHRONIC AND OFTEN DISABLING DISEASE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT TYPICALLY IS DIAGNOSED IN YOUNG ADULTHOOD. IT'S A PUZZLING AND UNPREDICTABLE DISEASE VARIES WIDELY IN ITS IMPACT NOT ONLY FROM PERSON TO PERSON. BUT ALSO IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AT DIFFERENT TIMES. MS CAN IMPAIR MUSCLE STRENGTH -- SENSATION BALANCE COORDINATION AND GATE AND BECAUSE SIGNIFICANT DISABLING FATIGUE. STUDIES CONSISTENTLY FIND THAT OVER 50% OF PEOPLE WITH A MASS HAVE FALLEN DOWN IN A THREE TO SIX MONTH PERIOD. AND 3250% HAD FALLEN MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE SAME TIME FRAME. BUT HOME MODIFICATIONS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THEY CAN INCREASE SAFETY IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY AND ALLOW PEOPLE WITH MS. TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE IN THEIR OWN HOMES CONTINUE TO WORK AND BE ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. SAFETY PRECAUTION PRECAUTIONS SUCH AS GRAB BARS AND SHOWERS ARE NEAR TOILETS. AND INVESTMENTS AND RAMPS AT ENTRANCE DOORS GRAB RAILS LONG STAYERS REYES TOILETS LOWERED LIGHT SWITCHES WILL ALLOW THE DISABLED INDIVIDUAL CONTINUED INDEPENDENCE. AND HELP THEM AVOID ACCIDENTS LEADING TO INJURIES AND HOSPITAL STAYS AND POSSIBLY INSTITUTIONALIZATION. THE COST OF MODIFYING HOME TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE VARIES WIDELY. THIS GRANT PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE CHANGES TO BUILDING STAMBERG. BUILDING STANDARDS ESTABLISHED THROUGH SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN ENHANCING ACCESSIBILITY.

FOUR THREE FOUR AND PRETTY SIMPLE BILL. SHOULD SHARE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE TODAY I PRESENT SB FORTY FOUR WHICH WILL PLACE INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES THE DAVIS STIRLING ACT. FOR MANAGERS AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES TO FOLLOW WHEN TRANSFERRING ASSOCIATION DOCUMENTS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONDOMINIUMS. AND AND TOWN HOUSES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE -- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN ASSOCIATION RETAINS NEW MANAGEMENT. AND THE FORMER MANAGER OR MANAGEMENT COMPANY FAILED TO TRANSFER THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IN A TIMELY MANNER WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY DAYS THESE DOCUMENTS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED. TO MEMBERSHIP THIS BOARD MEETINGS RECORDS. BY LAWS FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUCH AS OF THE BUDGET CONDO PLAN SEE SEE AN ART IN PUBLIC REPORT. THESE DOCUMENTS ARE USUALLY HANDED OVER FROM. ONE PROPERTY OWNER TO THE NEXT PROPERTY OWNER. BUT THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY -- USUALLY HAS THE EXACT SAME -- FILE. A NEW MANAGEMENT COMPANY CANNOT PERFORM MANY OF ITS SERVICES% WITHOUT THESE DOCUMENTS WHICH ULTIMATELY CREATED A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL ISSUES. FOR THAT ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. A COMMUNITY MANAGER SHE IS A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION OF ASSOCIATION MANAGERS MEMBERS. OF THE ASSOCIATION ABIDE BY A CODE OF ETHICS AND BEST PRACTICES WHICH INCLUDE GUIDELINES FOR THE TRANSFER OF THESE DOCUMENTS. AND OFTENTIMES WHAT'LL HAPPEN IS THE DEVELOPER SPECIALLY BRED WHEN WE'RE TALK ABOUT YOU HOUSING. THE DEVELOPER WILL HAVE THESE DOCUMENTS THAT I JUST MENTIONED AND GIVEN TO THE HOMEOWNER AND ALSO TO THE BRAND YOU ASSOCIATION. OF A HOMEOWNERS WHICH IS RUN BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION SO HERE IT IS FIVE YEARS LATER. LET'S ASSUME THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE THEY HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT. AND TIME GOES ON AND HE DOESN'T LIKE THE ASSOCIATION HE'S WITH OR THE ASSOCIATION MANAGEMENT COMPANY. AND SO THEY CHANGE COMPANIES AND THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES. THE ASSOCIATION COMPANY. IS TO TRANSFER OF THE OF INFORMATION FROM ONE COMPANY TO THE OTHER. AND IT'S ALSO NECESSARY FOR THE FOR THE LENDING INSTITUTION TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON SO SB. FOUR THIRTY FOUR BORROWED FROM THE ASSOCIATION THE CODE OF ETHICS AND WILL CREATE A UNIFORM STANDARD. OF ALL COMMUNITY MANAGERS IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND STAFFERS THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND I WOULD POINT OUT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS REGARDING THE EXEMPTION -- IT WILL BE LOOKING AT TO THOSE EXEMPTIONS AND TAKING THOSE -- ISSUE BY ISSUE AS NOTED THE ALICE AN ANALYSIS I COMMIT TO WORK WITH THEM AND AND YOURSELF AND OUR STAFF TO TIGHTEN UP HE'S PERCEIVED LOOPHOLES. THE BILL IS CO SPONSORED BY THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A COMMUNITY MANAGER. FOR THESE REASONS I THEREFORE ASK FOR YOUR FIVE VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE CODY BOILS. WHO WILL BE PRESENTING -- YOU WHO WILL BE PRESENTING ANY INFORMATION YOU MAY HAVE AS WELL.

AND THE OTHER THE SECOND THING IS THAT IT WILL HELP. WE THINK ALLEVIATE THE POSSIBILITY OF COSTLY LITIGATION -- MOVING FORWARD -- THAT HAPPENS AT TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE. A DISPUTE WHEN ONE ASSOCIATION IS. TRANSFERRING THEIR DOCUMENTS FROM ONE MANAGER -- TO THE INCOMING MANAGER -- AS THE SENATOR SAID -- WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU AND THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESSING. THE DEFINITION -- ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AS WELL TO ADDRESS. ANY CONCERNS ANYBODY HAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY. MY NAME IS TOM FREELY IN THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS. I'VE ALSO OWNED AND BEEN SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY. SB FOUR THIRTY FOURS INTENDED. TO DIRECT THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY. ON THE TRANSFER OF RECORDS ON THE TERMINATION OF A CONTRACT WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN TERMINATED OR THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY HAS TERMINATED THE ASSOCIATION. I'M VERY PROUD. THAT THIS BILL HAS. I'D LINE SIMILAR TO THE CODE OF ETHICS AT CCM. ETHICS THAT WE AGGRESSIVELY HOLD OUR MEMBERS. TO AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MODEL WITNESSES KEEP WITHIN TIME FOR AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT -- IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. OKAY IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD GOOD AFTERNOON HI MARJORIE MURRAY CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW -- JULIE SOMEWHAT BAFFLED BY THE BILL WHILE WE FULLY SUPPORT THE IDEA. AND THE THE GOAL OF THE BILL THAT ASSOCIATION RECORDS SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM A TERMINATED PROPERTY MANAGER. TO A NEW PROPERTY MANAGER. UNFORTUNATELY THE EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL ARE SO BROAD. THAT THOSE EXEMPTIONS ACTUALLY A OBSTRUCT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL. THE BILL HAS PROVISIONS LIKE IF THE PROPERTY MANAGER DECIDES THAT IT'S TOO COSTLY TO TRANSFER THE RECORDS OR IT'S TOO MUCH OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. THAT THE PROPERTY MANAGER IS EXEMPTED FROM. TRANSFERRING THOSE RECORDS -- WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS. ARE ANOTHER LEVEL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT THESE ARE QUAYSIDE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND LIKE ANY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR ANY GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ASSOCIATION CAN'T FUNCTION WITHOUT RECORDS. HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO USE RECORDS FOR MANY PURPOSES FOR EXAMPLE. TO PROVIDE DISCLOSURES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OF THE ASSOCIATION'S FINANCIAL HEALTH. OF OF ITS -- POLICIES ON DISPUTE RESOLUTION IT NEEDS RECORDS TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS PAID ASSESSMENTS AND WHO HASN'T. BUT IF IT TURNS TO THE TERMINATED PROPERTY MANAGER AND SAYS HAND OVER THE RECORDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE PAID ASSESSMENTS AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT. AND THE TERMINATED PROPERTY MANAGER SAYS -- THOSE HAVE BEEN LOST OR DESTROYED ACCIDENTALLY THAN THE ASSOCIATION CAN FUNCTION. SO -- WE OPPOSE THE BILL FOR THOSE REASONS BECAUSE THE EXEMPTION EXEMPTIONS ARE SO BROAD AND SO DEEP. THAT THEY BASICALLY OBSTRUCT THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS OF THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION MY COLLEAGUE -- TOM SIR WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER PROVISIONS THAT WE FIND TROUBLESOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MY NAME IS TOM SIR I'M A RETIRED SUPERIOR COURT COMMISSIONER FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY. AT A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY POINTING OUT THAT THE MANAGER OF THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION. HAS A DUTY TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT. THE ASSOCIATION'S RECORDS. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN THIS EXEMPTIONS. SECTION SUBSECTION SEE IT ALSO IN SUBSECTION BE WHERE IT SAYS THAT A MANAGER. MANAGING AGENCIES LEAVING. SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE KLEIN RECORDS IN MORE THAN ONE FORM EVEN IF THEY MAINTAIN SUCH RECORDS. AND SO THE EFFECT OF THE BILL READ. SENATE A REALLY IS. TO TAKE THAT DUTY AND BASICALLY WIPE IT OUT. BECAUSE A MANAGER CAN SAY -- IT IS TOO COSTLY OR TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN -- TO PRODUCE THESE RECORDS AND THERE GOES THE DUTY -- DEVIOUS WITNESS DID MENTION THE AVOIDANCE OF COSTLY LITIGATION AND IRONICALLY. CAN I TALK ABOUT A DIFFERENT KIND OF LITIGATION. IF IN ASSOCIATION. THOUGHT ITS RECORDS AND THE PREVIOUS MANAGER SAID ALL I LOST THEM DESTROY THE MARIE WHATEVER I DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THE RECORDS. NO LITIGATION BECAUSE THIS BILL TAKES THEM OFF THE HOOK. AND SO I FOR THAT REASON I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY THREE NINE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- I WANNA -- I THANK GOD CENTER SALADA AND I SPONSOR FOR WORKING WITH US. WE HAVE A I FIGURE COMMITMENT. TO KEEP TO WORK ON TIGHTENING SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN THE POLLS AND AND OUR STAFF IS AVAILABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH THE AUTHOR WITH HIS SPONSOR.

NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH I'M HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING HOW -- IF THERE KALRA RECORDS HOW YOU COULD HAVE THE IT COULD BE AN UNDUE BURDEN OR EXPENSIVE TURNING THEM BACK OVER.

YES OUR I'M I'M AWARE OF THESE AND WE WILL TAKE THEM UP AND I WILL PERSONALLY MEET -- WITH THE OPPOSITION HERE BECAUSE I DO UNDERSTAND IT NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT I'M BRINGING IT FORWARD BECAUSE WE CANNOT ALLOW -- AN ASSOCIATION NOT TO DELIVER THE DOCUMENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER AND THE FACT IS THAT THE LENDERS ARE WAITING FOR THESE DOCUMENTS TO COMPLETE THE LOAN TRANSACTION. SO WE NEED TO DO ALL THIS TOGETHER INITIAL WATCH WHY AM I AM OPEN TO YOUR SUGGESTIONS AND AMENDMENTS THAT WILL WILL COME FORWARD. THANK YOU FIVE SENATORS ARE AWESOME. I JUST WANTED. ZERO WHAT ARE -- FELLOW SENATORS HERE HAVE SAID IS. IT SEEMS TO CONTRADICT. A BIT OF YOUR PURPOSE WHICH I APPLAUD YOU -- FOR BUT IT SEEMS TO JUST TAKE AWAY.

A JUDGE SIR BRINGS UP THE POINT THAT THAT THIS MANAGER HAS A DUTY NOW THOSE ARE ACTUALLY NOT HER RECORDS THROUGH THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION RECORDS AND THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL I MEAN IT'S NICE TO MAKE A COMMITMENT.

BEFORE WE GO FORWARD AGAIN AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT WHEN WE WE STARTED THIS WE HADN'T GOTTEN -- THE SURVEY COMPLETED IN ONE OF MY WINTERS IN THE TIME LINE TO GET IT IN.

AND I I JUST WANTED TO ADD I'D SPOKEN AT CENTER HOW ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE START SINCE I MAY HAVE TO LEAVE IN THE MIDDLE. OF THIS SIZE TIME FOR THIS ITEM TO PRESENT IN HUMAN SERVICES. I DID JUST WANT. TO SAY BECAUSE ARENA BILLS ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE SENSITIVE -- THAT -- IS. THE TIME TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL THE CENTER HILL IS. TAKEN -- SOME GOOD AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOUSING IMPRISONING ITSELF. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW -- DIED A BIG PART OF THE REASON WHY THESE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED UNITS OF HOUSING -- WILL I BELIEVE GET BUILT IN BRISBANE IS BECAUSE OF THE AUTHOR BECAUSE OF CENTER. HILL ON I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS PROJECT VERY CLOSELY IT'S RIGHT ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF SAN FRANCISCO AND IT'S BEEN A LOT OF TENSION. OVER THE BAY LANDS -- AND IT WAS STOCK AND CENTER HILL GOT IT ON STOCK -- THROUGH HIS -- POLITICAL PROWESS AND UNDER CERTAIN THE POLITICAL PROCESS% THE LEGISLATIVEPROCESS -- EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. AND SO AS A RESULT -- IT'S MOVING FORWARD IN THE VOTERS OF BRISBANE -- ARE HAVE -- AGREED TO IT. AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS RINA ADJUSTMENT IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO SEE A HUGE AMOUNT OF NEW HOUSING. MEMBERS FRIENDS OF THANK YOU SENATOR I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT SAME IN CASE I HAVE TO LEAVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT -- COLLEAGUES I WANT TO START BY THANKING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME AND THE OF MY OFFICE ON THIS MEASURE AND AND REALLY MAKING IT STRONGER. I'M HAPPILY ACCEPTED ME VERY VERY HAPPILY ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED IN COMIC NUMBER EIGHT THAT INCREASES THE REQUIREMENT. TWO SIX HUNDRED AND INTO CONDITION THIS EXEMPTION UPON THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVING THE SPECIFIC PLAN FOR THE SITE. WITHIN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF RECEIVING IT FROM THE DEVELOPER. AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE VOTERS IN BRISBANE AS YOU SAID MADE A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT. TO REGIONAL HOUSING WHEN THEY APPROVED MEASURE JJ WHICH WOULD PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED UNITS OF HOUSING ON THE BAILOUT. THIS WOULD MORE THAN DOUBLE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE HOUSING STOCK CURRENTLY IN BRISBANE -- PASSING MAJOR JJ WAS A WATERSHED MOMENT FOR BRISBANE AND THE STATE MAJOR JJ REVERSES NEARLY FIFTY YEARS OF VOTE AGAINST DEVELOPMENT OF THE BAY LANDS. IT REPRESENTS A TYPE OF LOCAL LEADERSHIP WE NEED THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA AND THE STATE IF WE ARE GOING TO PUT A REAL DENT IN THE HOUSING CRISIS. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE REMEDIATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS BRISBANE WILL BE WORKING FOR MANY YEARS IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEVELOPER STATE AND REGIONAL AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. TO KEEP THE PROJECT ON TRACK. SB SIX SEVENTY TWO ALLOWS BRISBANE TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON GETTING THE BAY LANDS AN IMPORTANT REGIONAL PROJECT. DEVELOPED PROPERLY THE BILL DOES THIS BY INSURING CONSISTENCY IN BRISBANE'S REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATIONS DURING THE PLANNING CYCLE AND THE NEXT IN RECOGNITION OF THE COMMITMENT ALREADY MADE BY THE CITY'S VOTERS TO DOUBLE ITS HOUSING STOCK. SB SIX SEVENTY TWO IS NOT A GIFT THAT IS THE BENEFIT TO BRISBANE UNDER THE BILL IS ONLY AVAILABLE IF THE CITY CONTINUES TO MAKE STEADY PROGRESS WITH THE BILL AS DEVELOPMENT UNDER THE OVERSIGHT. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOP. DEVELOPMENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE SEEMS THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND I DO HAVE A WITNESS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU -- YES THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS OF THE COMMISSION MY NAME'S JOHN SAKE AND THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR THE CITY OF BRISBANE I'VE BEEN IN THAT POSITION FOR ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS.

AS SENATOR HILL POINTED OUT IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE VOTERS IN BRISBANE DID APPROVE -- BOUGHT BALLOT MEASURE JJ PERMITTING DEVELOPMENT OF BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED UNITS ON THE SITE KNOWN AS THE BRISBANE VALENCE. AND AS YOU MENTIONED IT DOES DOUBLE THE THE SIZE OF THE CITY IN THAT PARTICULAR MEASURE. THE BAIL AND IS A HEAVILY ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPACTED SITE HAVING PREVIOUSLY BEEN USED AS A LANDFILL AND OF RAIL YARD. AND THE LANDOWNER HAS -- NOT YET CLEANED UP THE LAND BUT IS AGREED TO DO SO AS PART OF THIS PLANNING EFFORT. THE VOTE IN NOVEMBER DID REPRESENT A MAJOR SHIFT IN THE COMMUNITY IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR HOUSING IN THE REGION. AS WELL AS A DESIRE TO SEE THE BAY LANCE CLEANED UP AND PUT -- TO A BENEFICIAL USE. OVER THE BAY LANDS DEVELOPMENT HIS COMPLEXION REQUIRE A NUMBER OF YEARS OF COORDINATION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE VARIOUS A REGULATORY AGENCY THE STATE INCLUDING DTS C.. AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD. AS WELL AS OTHER APPROPRIATE AGENCIES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND UTILITIES TO SUPPORT THE SITE IN THE INFLUX OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD OCCUR. SB SIX SIX SEVENTY TWO RECOGNIZES THE SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT THE CITY'S MAKING. TO TO REGIONAL HOUSING BY PURSUING THE PROJECT IS MORE THAN 6100% OF ITS CURRENT MEAN ALLOCATION. SB SIX SEVENTY TWO FURTHER LIMITS THE ADDITION OF NEW RENO OBLIGATIONS TO BRISBANE FOR THE NEXT CYCLE ALLOWING THE DEVELOPER THE CITY. AND THE REGULATORS AND COMMUNITY THE FOCUS ON THE WORK THAT MUST BE COMPLETED TO ACHIEVE THIS PROJECT -- THE REMEDIATION EFFORTS AND SPECIFIC PLANNING DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT. AND LASTLY SB SIX SEVENTY TWO WILL PROVIDE SPACE AND TIME FOR THE COMMUNITY AND CITY TO WORK. TOGETHER ON THIS PROJECT. WILL REQUIRING ANNUAL PROGRESS TO BE DEMONSTRATED TO THE SATISFACTION OF STATE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. PASSED FOR I'D LOAD ON SB SIX SEVENTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ASK AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

BOYS AND A WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY ME WE'RE WE'RE GIVING THEM WHY DO WE ALLOW THAT FOR EVERYONE WELL I'D I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS AT SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD LOOK AT TO MAYBE IT'S A GOOD HEARING BUT DIED YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE. A GOOD NEXT BILL -- BUT THIS ONE IS SPECIFIC TO BRISBANE AND THE THE GOOD WORK THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT CITY IS TO UNDERTAKEN -- TO REALLY DOUBLE AND THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THEIR CITY IS IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY IT'S A IT'S A MAJOR. ACCOMPLISHMENT THINK HOW DO WE CAPITALIZE MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE THIS GOOD ABOUT IT. THEN THERE SHOULD BE SOME. EXEMPTIONS FOR OUR FOR OTHER CITIES AND SO I AGREE AYE AYE. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD COLLABORATE WITH YOU ON A BILL I'M NOT WORTHY. BUT WITH SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT I THINK YOU'RE STARTING LISA PRESIDENT THEM. MAYBE WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT I AGREE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SEND ANY OTHER ON ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THEN WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- FROM SENATOR ROBB.

YOU GET TO MOVE IN THE FIRST POSITION HERE. WHAT YOU'RE TO MOVE SOME? THANK YOU -- THIS VICE CHAIR IN MEMBERS -- I WILL I'M THINKING THE CHAIR -- THERE'S NO MA'AM IT'S BEING TAKEN IN THERE NO MA'AM IT'S THIS COMMITTEE ASKED FOR BUT WEARE TAKING IN THIS COMMITTEE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED WITH -- GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. OUT SB. THREE THIRTY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN A SERIOUS HOUSING CRISIS. WE ARE FORTY NINTH IN HOUSING UNITS PER CAPITA IN THE U. S.. OUR RENTS AND HOME PRICES ARE OUT OF REACH FOR MOST EVERY CALIFORNIAN. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE MEDIAN PRICE. TO PURCHASE A HOME IN CALIFORNIA WAS TWO POINT FIVE TIMES THE AVERAGE OF WHAT YOU'D PAY IN ANY OTHER STATE. END OF THE FIFTY MOST EXPENSIVE CITIES IN TERMS OF RENTAL MARKETS THIRTY THREE ARE IN CALIFORNIA. THESE HIGH COSTS WHICH ARGUE GREATLY TO SCARCITY BECAUSE OF OUR VERY SEVERE LACK OF UNITS PER CAPITA. HAVE EXACERBATED HOMELESSNESS. IN OUR HOMELESSNESS HAS GROWN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND IF WE LOOK AT THE DATA. ARE NEWLY HOMELESS PEOPLE. OUR EMPLOYED AND WE'RE RECENTLY HOUSE STE THEY'RE NOT ADDICTED THEY'RE NOT MENTALLY ILL THEY ARE JUST PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE COST OF HOUSING. NOW YOU SAY WHY IS SB THREE THIRTY DESIGNED TO HELP THAT SB THREE THIRTY IS NOT SPECIFICALLY A BILL THAT WOULD ONLY. CREATE THE LOWEST -- MOST AFFORDABLE UNITS RATHER IT IS A BILL [inaudible] THAT. SAYS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PARTNER WITH US AS WE ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. THE END [inaudible] IT. RELIES ON THE EXISTING ZONING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAS. AND IT SAYS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FACILITATE THE HOUSING THAT YOU WOULD ALREADY ALLOW BY YOUR OWN RULES. DO SO BY SPEEDING UP THE PERMITTING PROCESS SO ONCE YOU HAVE DETERMINED YOU THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ONCE YOU HAVE DETERMINED THAT AN APPLICATION IS COMPLETE. TAKE NO MORE THAN A YEAR TO PROCESS THAT APPLICATION. AND WITH GOVERNMENT AND FINANCES A MEN'S HAVE NO MORE THAN FIVE PUBLIC HEARINGS. IT ALSO SAYS DON'T CHANGE THE RULES MIDSTREAM ONCE YOU'VE DEEMS THAT APPLICATION COMPLETE DON'T CHANGE YOUR DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS. DON'T CHANGE OF THE RULES JUST PROCESS THE APPLICATION. IT ALSO SUSPENDS FOR TEN YEARS THE BILL'S ONLY IN EFFECT FOR TEN YEARS IT SUSPENDS THOSE ACTIONS THAT WOULD DECREASE OR DELAY. THE NEW HOUSING SUCH AS DOWN ZONING. POPULATION CAPS OR CAPS ON HOUSING WHICH UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF OUR GOVERNMENT -- GET LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ENACTED. IT ALSO LISTS. THEIR PARKING MINIMUMS. BUT ONLY WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF TRANSIT BANDED EXAM SMALL ROLE CITIES NOW WHY IS THAT IN THE BILL BECAUSE WHAT MAKES HOUSING COSTS LEAVE BESIDES JUST THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS LABOR. IS TIME. SO DELAY NOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS. AND ADD ONS LIKE PARKING PARKING IN CALIFORNIA EACH [inaudible] EACH. UNIT A PARKING. CAN BE VALUED AT YOU CAN ADD. TO THE COST OF THAT UNIT. MINIMUM OF TEN THOUSAND AND UPWARDS TO SIXTY THOUSAND DEPENDING ON WHERE IT IS BUILT AND HOW IT IS BUILT. SO THE LIFTING THE PARKING MINIMUMS IT DOESN'T SAY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR DEVELOPER YOU CAN'T ADD PARKING IF THE PERSON WHO IS BUILDING THE HOUSING WANTS NEEDS PARKING TO MAKE. THE UNIT. WORK. THEN THAT'S ALLOWED IT JUST LIFTS REQUIRED PARKING MINIMUMS AGAIN WITHIN A QUARTER MILE TRANSIT AND IN SMALL REAL CITIES IT ALSO REMOVES FOR TEN YEARS. THE FEES ON LOW INCOME UNITS AND HOLDS OFF ANY INCREASES ON OTHER FEES AGAIN JUST FOR THE TEN YEAR PERIOD SO THAT'S IN EFFECT WITH THE BILL WOULD DO. AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SPEAKING IT'S DAVID GARCIA FROM THE TURNER CENTER AT UC BERKELEY. THANK YOU MUCH GOOD EVENING MEMBERS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING DIVISION. A UC BERKELEY AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL -- I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING ESPECIALLY WITH THIS COMMITTEE THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN THE THROES OF A DEEP AND WORSENING HOUSING CRISIS THAT THREATENS. OF I TELL THE ENTIRE STATE WE HAVE HALF OF ALL THE RENTERS THAT ARE CONSIDERED RENT PER MINUTE OF OF THOSE 30% ARE CONSIDERED. A SEVERELY RENT BURDENS ON TOP OF THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING OUR LOWEST RATES OF HOMEOWNERSHIP SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES SO LEAGUE NEEDLESS TO SAY THE THE SCALE THIS CHALLENGE. DEMANDS POLICIES THAT MATCH THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THERE ARE A FEW POLICIES ON THE TABLE THAT ARE AS BOLD. AS WAS PROPOSED IN SB THREE THIRTY SO SO WE ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL FOR TWO SPECIFIC REASONS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY OUR RESEARCH. AND THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT IT WOULD LARGELY PROHIBIT DOWN ZONING SOME MORATORIUM'S THAT WOULD LIMIT THE CAPACITY FOR NEW HOUSING AS PART OF OUR CALIFORNIA LAND USE SURVEY -- WE HAD WE SAW THAT MANY CITIES ARE DOING -- THEIR THEIR FAIR SHARE TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO NEW HOUSING. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SEVERAL CITIES THAT ACTUALLY REPORTED TO US THAT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THEY HAVE MADE THEIR LAND USE EVEN MORE RESTRICTIVE. MANY TIMES THESE ARE COMMUNITIES OF AYE OPPORTUNITY WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO TO BE LOOKING TO BUILD FOR HOUSING AND SO THIS BILL WOULD HELP ADDRESS THAT. ALSO THE COST TO BUILD HOUSING -- IT IS -- WAS PARTICULARLY -- GONE VERY HIGH THE LAST TEN YEARS AND THIS BILL WOULD HELP ADDRESS THAT BY LIMITING OUR PARKING REQUIREMENTS MODIFYING HOW FEES WILL BE IMPOSED IN LIMITING OTHER. OWNERS POLICIES SO IS OUR WORK IS ALSO SHOWN THE COST TO BUILD A HAS A GUN UP ASTRONOMICALLY PARTICULARLY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THINGS LIKE EXCESSIVE FEES ON THE SIR PARKING REQUIREMENTS -- MAIN DELAYS IN ENTITLEMENTS AND PERMIT ISSUANCE THESE CAN ADD SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO THE TO THE OVERALL COST TO BUILD NEW HOMES. SO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT -- ONE I THINK THE SENATOR AND THE A COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND AGAIN WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. ADDITIONAL -- SUPPORTERS COME FORWARD. I'M SORRY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BATES MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PETER GOT FALL AND I'M WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS IN ALL NINE BAY AREA COUNTIES AND WE'RE HERE TO STATE OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB. THREE THIRTY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL GREATLY HELP IN THE PRODUCTION OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES IN THE BAY AREA AND ALL HOMES IN GENERAL -- IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE MAIN COMPONENTS TO GET IT BUILT YOU NEED LAND MONEY AND POLITICAL WILL AND SB THREE THIRTY WILL TACKLE THE POLITICAL WILL QUESTION -- IN THE BAY AREA AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS CAN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO TEN YEARS TO GO FROM CONCEPT TO REALITY. AND BY LIMITING THE APPROVAL PROCESS TO TWELVE MONTHS FOR NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS SB THREE THIRTY WILL GREATLY SPEED UP THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE HOMES -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS LIKE ALL DEVELOPMENTS TO NEED CERTAINTY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES IN THE BAY AREA FOR INSTANCE THERE IS A BERKELEY PROJECT THAT. STARTED WITH ONE PARKING REQUIREMENT IN WAS APPROVED WITHOUT PARKING REQUIREMENT IN MIND AND THEN AFTER THE PROJECT WAS APPROVED. THE PARKING REQUIREMENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE LANE THAT THE APPROVAL THE BILL IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT PROJECT. AND NECESSITATING FOR TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD TO FIND MORE SUBSIDY TO PAY FOR PARKING SPOTS -- AND SB THREE THIRTY REMOVES THAT UNCERTAINTY IN THE PROCESS. AND FINALLY WE THINK THAT BY HAVING THE CERTAINTY AND CLARITY IN THE PROCESS WILL GET MORE HOMES BUILT AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES. FOR CALIFORNIANS OF ALL INCOME LEVELS SO FOR THAT -- FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. THREE THIRTY SILVIO FOR HIM TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION FACEBOOK IN SUPPORT. SIMONA THOMPSON ROSAMOND SUPPORTED THE BILL. LOUIS MANTE WITH CALIFORNIA BEING VERY STRONG SUPPORT. AARON EVANS ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY IS SPACE SILICON VALLEY ALSO IN SUPPORT. TODD DAVID ON BEHALF OF THE BAY AREA HOUSING ADVOCACY COALITION STRONG SUPPORT. TIFFANY FAN I'M HAVE A BRIDGE HOUSING AND SUPPORT. A RUBBER COATED IN STRONG SUPPORT. JEFF MORGAN PRESIDENT FIRST COMMITTEE HOUSING IN SAN JOSE SUPPORT. MARJORIE MURRAY CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS. LOG IN SUPPORT. ALLEN J. CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCIES IN SUPPORT. MATTHEW HARPER THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. MANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THEN ALL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES -- UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE -- LAST TIME WHEN I PRESENTED IN I BELIEVE HIS GOVERNMENT'S FINANCE WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF OUR MAIN CONCERNS AND WE CERTAINLY DO NOT DISPUTE OR OR YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW DEBATE WHETHER NOW WE'RE HOUSING CRISIS WE CERTAINLY ARE AND WHEN YOU GO TO GREAT LENGTHS IN OUR HELP ADDRESS THAT. WE IS BELIEVE THAT APPROACH IS BEING TAKEN IN THIS BILL I'M NOT ALL OF THE APPROACHES BUT THE MAINLY THE PURCHASE OF MY TOUCH ON HERE BRIEFLY -- ARE OF CONCERN AND WE THINK PERHAPS THERE'S A THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF DOING IT -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE FEES AND FREEZING FEEDS FOR A DECADE I MEAN A DECADE IS IS A LONG TIME -- AND THESE FEES ARE IN PLACE FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS AND THOSE FEES HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW PUT IN PLACE BASED ON THE MITIGATION FEE ACTOR PROP -- TWO EIGHTEEN OR WHATEVER MAY BE AND WE CAN ONLY CHARGE WHAT CASA DELIVER THAT SERVICE I'M CITIES ARE FEES THAT ARE THAT ARE MEANT TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE TO THE RESIDENTS ARE GONNA DEMAND -- SOME OF THE AND IN SOME OF THESE FEES AND IF YOU LIMITS OF THESE FEES ARE CAP THOSE FEES -- FOR IT FOR A DECADE IT'S REALLY CROSS PURPOSES WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE TOLD US TO DO. LAST TIME I SPOKE ABOUT RENT CONTROL AND AND ACTUALLY MENTIONED THAT THE SUPERFLUOUS FROM GENERATE CONTROL IT DOESN'T DO THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A PRECLUDES US FROM IMPOSING INCLUSION HOUSING REQUIREMENTS FOR DECADES OF THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING NOW. WE COULDN'T DO THAT -- BUT THE LEGISLATURE'S PASSED AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE THAT CLARIFIED SOME THIS IS A REALLY TO RENTAL HOUSING. AND IT'S A POLICY THE STATE THE YEAH WE WANT TO SEE INCLUSIONARY THAT'S A WAY FOR US TO GET AFFORDABLE UNITS BUILT OUR CMMUNITY. THIS WOULD CERTAINLY PAS THAT FOR A DECADE AND WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SOME OF OUR JURISDICTIONS EVEN GONE AS FAR AS WEAVING SOME OF THESE FEES ON THEIR OWN AND PAYING FOR IT OUT OF THERE GENERAL FUND. THE CITY IS CURRENTLY DOING THAT SAY FOR EXCESS RECALLING UNITS THAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR IT AS OUR GENERAL FUND. THAT DECADE IF THERE'S A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO REIMPOSE THOSE FEES -- SINCE EVEN COVER AMOUNT OF THEIR AND OTHER GENERAL FUND SO YOU KNOW WE WE THINK FREEZE INDUSTRIES FOR DECADE IS IS IS A LITTLE TOO BROAD FOR EVERY JURISDICTION WE DON'T THINK THAT SHE HAS A GOOD CASE. IT REALLY IS A JURISDICTIONS AT THE RIVER THAT FALL UNDER THIS BILL. NOW WITH REGARD TO PARKING WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDED ON PARKING THAT ARE REALLY ONLY PERTAINS TO THE QUARTER MILE -- FROM TRANSIT OR YOU COULD HAVE A SPOT IF YOU'RE BEYOND THAT -- DIDN'T PORTENT THING TO NOTE ABOUT PARKING AS PRIDE ONE THING THAT WE FIGHT OVER THE MOST I THINK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS PARKING PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO GET FOLKS OUT OF THE CAR SIR POLICIES IN PLACE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO GET PEOPLE OTHER CARS BUT IT WAS GIVEN OF THE CAR. SO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BALANCE THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THE SENATOR YOU MENTIONED THE THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT SAVES WHEN WE DON'T IMPOSE PARKING FARMS ARE DEVELOPER. UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL DOESN'T CAPTURE THAT SO AT A MINIMUM I WOULD THINK THAT IF THE STATE WANTS TO NOT ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IMPOSE PARKING OR RESTRICT THAT PARKING. THAT THERE'S AT LEAST SOME DEMONSTRATION ON THE DEVELOPERS AND THAT THE COST OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS EITHER GONE DOWN ORDER SOME SORT OF AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENT IT JUST SEEMS THAT IT MAKES SENSE SO WE WANT TO CAPTURE THAT. BECAUSE OF NOT DEVELOPERS OR LIKELY THESE THOSE ARE FOR PROFIT WE'RE GONNA MAKE MORE MONEY BECAUSE ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO TO LOWER THE COST WE ALSO HAVE AN AMOUNT OF TIME THERE'S A ONE QUICK LITTLE LASTING SAY. THE INITIAL COMPLETE APPLICATION I THINK -- MY COLLEAGUES PRETTY PIECE FOR YOU TALK ABOUT THAT -- BUT THAT'S A NEW ISSUE IN THE BILL A NEW CONCEPT AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT SINCE EACH CD WILL DETERMINE WHAT IS OR WHAT INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IT TO MAKE IT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION. THEY'RE GONNA DO THAT OUTSIDE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT WHICH MEANS YOU CAN JUST DO IT HOWEVER THEY WANT WITHOUT ANY INPUT WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE. CITY GEORGIA PRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. SHE THE OTHER STAFF WORKING WITH US -- IN FACT SHE'S PROBABLY GONNA GET OUR ATTORNEYS TOGETHER WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT WE DO HAVE A NUMBER A SUBSTANTIVE REMAINING ISSUES. I THINK A LOT OF THE PIECES OF THE BILL ARE SUPPORTED BY A PA -- INCLUDING THE FREEZE ON INITIATIVE IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ELIMINATING REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL VOTER APPROVAL FROM SOME HOUSING DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. LIMITING RESPONSES ON EVERY VICE APPLICATION TO THOSE ON THE CHECKLIST OF PREVENT THE TWO BITES AT THE APPLE. AN ALTERNATIVE NO NET LOSS PROCESSES AND ALTERNATIVE TO A COMPLETE BAN ON CHANGES TO A LESS INTENSIVE USE. AND CLARIFICATION ON THE SEQUEL INTERACTION ALL THOSE THE AMENDMENTS WELL LONG WAY TO ISSUES ADDRESSED SOME OF OUR MORE TECHNICAL ISSUES. BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME SUBSTANTIVE CONCERNS AND THE ONE JUST MENTIONED BY THE LEAGUE -- THE NEW LAYER OF A COMPLETE INITIAL APPLICATION. THE E. DEFINITION OF THAT. DOES NOT INCLUDE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE JURISDICTION DEAVER EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THINGS COULD BE APPLIED OR SHOULD BE APPLIED. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS VERY VERY CLEAR BEFORE WE GET -- ONE OF THOSE APPLICATIONS BUT WE DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO ADDITIONAL. AT LAYER OF PROCESS WHEN EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS SO WE DO THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE -- ELIMINATED FROM THE BILL -- THE RETROACTIVE FREEZE DATES FOR A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS ON THE OFF THE TABLE INCLUDING ALL THE HOUSING BILLS THAT WERE SIGNED A LAW LAST YEAR INCLUSIONARY ZONING IF THEY HAVE AN ADOPTED. ONE EVEN SOME OF THE ATTEMPTS FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL TO MAKE OBJECTIVE DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS ALL THOSE THINGS COULD BE DETERMINED TO INCREASE THE COST OF HOUSING EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE MEANT TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. OF THE LIMITING THE DESIGN STANDARDS IF THEY'RE MORE COSTLY AND EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST. THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT I THINK INCLUDES THINGS THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF WHERE THE AUTHOR WANTS TO BE IN THE END. THE AFFORDABLE ROGUE REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE EXPANDED STREAMLINING THE BILL -- AND WERE ALSO VERY CONCERNED WITH THE ARBITRARY NUMBER OF HEARINGS VERTICALLY FOR LARGE PROJECTS GOING FROM TWO TO FIVE IS DEFINITELY BETTER -- WE DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A MALE A MAXIMUM OF TWELVE MONTHS FOR THE PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT. BUT THAT'S BETTER THAN AN ARBITRARY LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS VERTICALLY FOR LARGE PROJECTS IN PARTICULAR WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE HEARING TO SEE BECAUSE YOU DON'T END UP IN COURT. SO THOSE ARE THE CAN SCAN TENURED ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. HE'S OUT THERE YEAH. OKAY AND THE DIVERSITY CREDIT OKAY AWESOME THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION THE BILL PLEASE CONFIRM. CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF CESSATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE HAVE A POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ARE CONCERNED THE BILL IS IN RELATION TO THE TEMPORARY MORATORIUM THAT WOULD BE PLACED ON CONNECTION FEES INCAPACITY CHARGES -- I'D LIKE TO JUST REITERATE THE COMMENTS JUST MADE A AND REGARDS THOSE FEES AND THE STRAIGHT CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST. I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFFERS CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IF WE ARE ABLE TO DRESS SO WE DON'T KNOW FOR THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING CARE ALSO BE UP THE CITY OF SALON A BEACH IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. OKAY WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR ROSS. THANK YOU MISTER I GUESS SINCE EVERYBODY DISAPPEARED FROM THE TABLE IN FRONT OF ME -- AS THE OTHER THIS QUESTION. THE THE LEAGUE FOR EXAMPLE IS SAYS OBJECTED TO THE FREEZE ON IMPACT FEES. FOR THE TEN YEAR PERIOD REFERENCING THE FACT THAT IT'S A VERY LONG TIME -- AND ALSO AS A SUPPOSED PROVING DESIGN STANDARDS OF MORE COSTLY HAVE THERE BEEN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS OFFERED BY THE LEAGUE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OBJECTIONS NO ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN OFFERED TODAY. CENTER THERE ALSO. YES SENATOR -- WE RECENTLY HAD IN LOS ANGELES SOME. LOCAL MEASURES PASSED AROUND HOUSING BOTH HOMELESS AND LOW INCOME HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- IT'S WOULD OVERRIDE ALL OF A WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON LOCAL MEASURES PASSED BY CITIES OR COUNTIES THE ONLY -- MEASURES THAT A CITY OR COUNTY MAY OF ENACTED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT THIS WOULD AFFECT IN THIS WOULD ONLY BE ONES ENACTED IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WOULD BE IF THEY ENACTED DOWN ZONING -- FOR IF ENACTED A HOUSING CAP. ANOTHER WORDS HE SAID WERE YOU KNOW WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY MORE THAN THIS MANY UNITS OF HOUSING. AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE CITY OF LA IS NOT DONE EITHER OF THOSE -- SO. IT WOULD NOT -- EFFECT DOES IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ANY ACTION ON FOR EXAMPLE DENSITY BONUSES INCLUSIONARY HOUSING -- IMPACT FEES OTHER THAN THE FROM THIS FROM WHATEVER IT GOES INTO EFFECT HOLDING THOSE. AT THE FEET LEVEL. WOULD ALL BE RESPECTED. UNDER THE BILL [inaudible] CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR ON THE IT. COUPLE QUESTIONS THE THE THE LEAGUE IN -- TALKED ABOUT INCLUSIONARY HOUSING AND THEN FEES THAT ARE BEING PAID. FOR FOR FROM THE GENERAL FUND -- HEY MIKE MY GUESS IS THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION OF YOUR BILL BECAUSE AS I READ IT THE WHOLE PURPOSE MAN I RAN A A BILL SIMILAR I THINK YOU DID IT MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY IN YOUR BILL -- THAN I DID LAST YEAR -- BUT THE INTENTION IS THAT YOU KNOW GOING IN WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU TO BUILD THE UNIT AND THEN IT DOESN'T SPIRAL AND SKYROCKET -- BASED ON JUST. KIND OF FACTORS THAT NO ONE CAN FIGURE OUT RIGHT SO -- WHAT'S YOUR ANALYSIS IN REGARDS TO WHETHER -- THE CURRENT LANGUAGE WOULD. WOULD. PROHIBIT. THE JURISDICTION FROM ADOPTING INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE IN THE IN THE IN TRUMP -- IN IN BOTH THE DIRECTION TO LEAD COUNSEL WHO OF COURSE DRAFT THESE BILLS FOR US AND TO THE EXPERTS THAT I'VE INTERACTED WITH. TO DESIGN THIS BILL -- IT WAS NEVER OUR INTENTION TO PRECLUDE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT DOES NOT. SO UNTIL. AM THE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES ASSERTED THIS IN THE GOVERNOR'S SAN FINANCE COMMITTEE I WENT BACK TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO -- HELPED CONSTRUCT THE BILL TO DO TO GET THEIR OPINION AS TO WHETHER IT. PRECLUDED EXCLUSION INCLUSIONARY HOUSING. AND THEY ALL SAID NO SO I AM HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. TO TRY TO IDENTIFY IN WHAT WAY THEY BELIEVE THAT SO BECAUSE EVEN WHEN WE WENT BACK TO LEDGE COUNCIL TO GET THEIR OPINION THEY WERE LIKE NO DOESN'T. SO BUT CLEARLY AS WE KNOW YOU GET ANY NUMBER OF LAWYERS IN A ROOM THEY'RE GONNA SOMETIMES DISAGREE BUT I'M HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM BECAUSE IT IS NOT OUR INTENTION TO PRECLUDE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING WHATSOEVER -- THE FREEZE ON FEES FOR TEN YEARS -- EASY I CAN APPRECIATE WHY -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- BUT IT'S ALSO ONE OF THOSE FACTORS WHERE. I DIDN'T SEE THIS MY OPENING BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR JURISDICTIONS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY FIRE EARTHQUAKE. IT IS VERY VERY COMMON AFTER A LARGE LOSS OF UNITS DUE TO THESE KIND OF DISASTERS THAT THE JURISDICTION RELAXES RULES SUSPENDS RULES AND LOWERS FEES OR FREEZES FEES. AGAIN TO HELP GET THAT HOUSING REPLACED QUICKLY. SO WE ARE IN A WE'VE IN FACT HAD A FIRE OVER THE WHOLE STATE EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T DESTROYER UNITS WE DIDN'T BUILD ENOUGH. SO MMHM THE APPROACH OF THE BILL IS. TO WITH HIS TO SAY LOOK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS YOU'VE ALREADY DONE ALL THIS PLANNING AND ALL THIS -- DINO SEQUEL WORK EVERYTHING AND YOU'VE ALLOWED SO MUCH HOUSING BUT THERE'S BUILT IN SO MANY DELAYS AND SO MANY COSTS AND SO MANY OTHER IMPEDIMENTS. IT ISN'T BEING PRODUCED FAST ENOUGH AND SINCE WE'RE IN THIS HORRIBLE CRISIS LET'S PRODUCE A FASTER SO LET'S RELAX THINGS A LITTLE BIT. AND JUST SPEEDED UP IN JUST FOR TEN YEAR PERIOD AND SEE IF WE CAN'T GET BACK INTO BALANCE OF THAT'S REALLY. THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AND AS YOU POINTED OUT CERTAIN OF THESE THINGS ALLOW FOR THE PERSON BUILDING HOUSING AND I DON'T SEE DEVELOPER BECAUSE HE COULD BE SOMEBODY JUST OWNS ONE LOT. IT YOU KNOW JUST IT ALLOWS THEM TO KNOW OKAY. I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT FIVE YEARS OR TEN YEARS. AND THESE NEW THINGS ARE GOING TO BE ADDED SO MY COST ESTIMATES OTHER THAN IF CONCRETE PRICES GO WAY UP OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW MY COST ESTIMATES ARE PRETTY ACCURATE. OKAY SO THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I DO YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED THIS IS THAT -- USUALLY IF IF FEES ARE GOING TO GO UP YOU'VE DONE THE VIEW SPENT AS A PERIOD OF TIME. UP DOING THE STUDIES RIGHT AND YOU CAN SEE THEM COMING AND SO THE JURISDICTIONS THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN. ARE THE JURISDICTIONS IN THE REGION WOULD SAY WOULD TELL DEVELOPERS GEAR COMING IN WE'RE WE'VE GOT THESE NEW TRAFFIC IMPACT FEES ARE WE'VE GOT THESE THESE NEW. PARK FEES OR WHATEVER AND BOB YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO THEM AT AND IF YOU DON'T GET IT DONE BY IF YOU DON'T A STARTED BY A CERTAIN DATE -- ADMITS ASSUMING THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE INTENDING TO TO FREEZE FOR THOSE THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD. YES AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD NOTE IS THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR'S CURRENTLY -- PUT BEFORE US WOULD NOT ADOPTED IT YET. BUT HE IS OFFERING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- HE'S HE'S OFFERING STATE MONEY INVESTMENT FOR THEM TO BRING. THEIR THEIR PERMIT PROCESS SEES TO BRING VARIOUS PLANNING PRESS SEIZE UP TO DATE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE HOUSING. SO. WHILE IT MAY NOT MEET THE WHAT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT WANT TO INCREASE THE FEE FOR OVER THIS TEN YEAR PERIOD IT'S CERTAINLY THE STATE IS NOT ABANDONING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE OFFERING IF WE ADOPT THAT. WE ARE OFFERING THEM SOME SUPPORT. AGAIN TO TRY TO FACILITATE HOUSING. I SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK IT'S IT'S A GOOD BILL I ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO OF WORK ON SOME OF THESE DETAILS I THINK THEY'RE THE RESOLVABLE -- AND I BUT WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU AT COLLEAGUES ANY OTHER COMMON CENTER BATES I DO NOT HAVE AND I AM HAD PROBLEMS WITH A NUMBER OF THE HOUSING. BILLS THAT HAVE FUN REDUCE PARKING REQUIRES BECAUSE IN MY COMMUNITY -- PUBLIC SAFETY BECAME A BIG ISSUE WITH. LOWERING OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE A LOT OF CHILDREN. AND PEOPLE PARK THEIR CARS AND THE KIDS GO BETWEEN HIM AND WE HAD TWO VERY UNFORTUNATE. DEATHS OF CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE OF THAT SO THING VERY ODD THING COMFORTABLE MAKING IT KIND OF COOKIE CUTTER. A SECOND LEAD THE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES THAT I REMEMBER WE IMPOSE STYLE OUT THE COUNTY. OF ORANGE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE RISING COST OF EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY IN CODE ENFORCEMENT WHERE YOU HAVE TO EXPAND IN AN S. WERE INCREASING THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILDING OF HOUSING YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE CODE ENFORCERS. AND CERTAINLY THE LOW SALARIES REYES AND OVER TEN YEARS I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS STUDY IS GOING TO LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT IS COMPARABLE TO HOW THE US INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY COSTS ACOSTA LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHEN YOU HAVE A MULTI MULTI FAMILY? THE FEES REALLY REFLECT THE NEED FOR MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABIDING BY THE LAWS NO PARKING ALL OF THAT. HELLO SIR -- SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT I HAVE WITH A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH THAT IMPLIED THAT MANDATES THIS ON ALL CITIES BECAUSE THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT -- SO I I HOLD THAT'LL BE SOME FLEXIBILITY AS WE GO FORWARD PUBLIC SAFETY IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE LOCAL. COMMUNITIES I AND THAT'S WHERE HUGE COSTS ARE NOW PUTTING MANY OF OUR CITIES IN JEOPARDY AND THE IMPACT FEES ARE SPECIFICALLY TO HELP OUT. SO -- YOU NEED TO TAKE I THINK A DEEPER DIVE ON THAT AND I KNOW WHEN THE CITY COMES FORWARD. THE INFLATIONARY -- YOU KNOW INDEX IS GOING TO HELP WITH THAT. BUT THIS IS PRETTY FAR REACHING OUT LASTLY MY HUSBAND'S AN ARCHITECT HAS DONE A LOT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN TO ENSURE THOSE DO NOT BECOME. GATAL LIKE AMENITIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT -- OTHERWISE YOU CREATE CONCRETE JUNGLES NAY WITHOUT SOME WAY BACK WHEN AND THAT THAT'S WHAT THE BECAME I WORK THE PROJECTS IN LA FOR AT LEAST. YOU KNOW WHAT FIVE SIX YEARS WHEN I WAS SOCIAL WORKER AND THOSE PROJECTS NEEDED MANY MORE AMENITIES SO THAT YOU HAD. MORE ON A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING SO WHEN YOU START CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT HAVE NO AMENITIES BECAUSE YOU'VE TAKEN AWAY IMPACT FEES YOU'RE STARTING TO CREATE. A PROBLEM GOING FORWARD AND THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT FINALLY THE ODD DESIGN STANDARDS WE'VE JUST IMPOSE A LOT OF DESIGN STANDARDS BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE WE REQUIRING SOLAR AND WE KNOW THAT THAT FOUGHT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CONSIDERED -- IN THIS BILL AND I THINK YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALMOST GOT CONTRADICTORY IF YOU WANT DESIGN STANDARDS THAT OF THAT ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. HIM THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THOSE ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THEY PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT OUT. SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS I'M GONNA VOTE NO TODAY. BUT I KNOW EVERYONE'S WORKING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TRYING TO CREATE MORE HOUSING SO I JUST LIKE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE. RATHER RIGID COOKIE CUTTER KIND OF APPROACHES TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO DEVELOP MORE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING THINKS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HERE THANK YOU. SO FIRST THE BILL DOES NOT AFFECT EVERY. AREA EVERY GEOGRAPHIC AREA IN THE STATE. THE IT'S TARGETED AND I'M POLICIES THAT I DID NOTSPECIFY THAT IT IS TARGETED AND ELLIE -- HAS CREATED A EXCEL SPREADSHEET FOR US. THAT I CAN SHARE WITH ANY OFFICES THAT CHOOSE -- TO THAT WOULD SHOW WHAT TIMES COMMUNITIES WOULD BE AFFECTED AND THE CRITERIA ARE. VACANCY RATE. SO VERY VERY LOW VACANCY RATES AND THEN THE EITHER HOUSING THE EITHER PRICE OF HOMES FOR RENTAL INCREASE PERCENT INCREASE SO HE REALLY IS TARGETED TOWARDS THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED THE MOST BY COST. AND VACANCY AND IT IT WOULD AFFECT THOSE SECONDARILY. IT RESPECTS THE DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALREADY YES IT DOES NOT REVERSE THOSE AT ALL SO WHEN YOU DESIGN REVIEW THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WOULD STAY INTACT -- IT ALSO REFLECTS RESPECTS ALL OF THE IMPACT FEES THAT ARE EXIST RIGHT NOW WOULD ONLY BE ONCE IT WENT INTO EFFECT FOR THAT SUNSET PERIOD DO NOT INCREASE THEM -- IT IN THE PARKING MINIMUM THIS ONE EIGHT EIGHT SO -- IT'S ONE OF THOSE HARD ONES WERE THE BILL DOES NOT FOR BID PARKING. AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS WITH GOVERNMENT AND FINANCE IT ONLY LISTS THE REQUIRED PARKING MINIMUM WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF TRANSIT. AND IT EXEMPTS SMALL AND RURAL CITIES SO ANYWHERE ELSE THE PARKING MINIMUM STAY NOW I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO LIFT THE PARKING MINIMUMS. WHICH WOULD STILL ALLOW IF YOU'RE BUILDING THE HOUSING AND YOU FEEL THAT YOU MUST HAVE THAT PARKING IT WOULD STILL ALLOW YOU TO PUT THAT PARKING IN. THE CHEST WOULD BE IF YOU WERE BUILDING HOUSING AND FELT THAT THE HOUSING COULD -- BE SUPPORTED WITHOUT THE PARKING BUT AS GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE WHICH I'VE. ACCEPTED IT IS NOW ONLY WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF TRANSIT AND ITS HIGH FREQUENCY TRANSIT SO -- THAT MAY NOT ADDRESS ALL OF YOUR CONCERNS BUT AT LEAST I WANTED TO LAY THOSE OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN -- WAS CHARACTERIZED. WELL THANK YOU FINISH SKINNER WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THAT YOUR FAST TRACKING. IT OUT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU. CERTAINLY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY -- I WANT TO REALLY THANKS -- THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICS OF BILLS AGAIN THE LEGISLATURE -- WHICH I THINK IS ALSO ONE OF CRITIQUE THAT I HOPE WE DO AWAY WITH ONE DAY AS WELL THIS BILL REALLY DOES A LOT. AND A AND MEN AS A CRITICISM SOMETIMES WHILE YOUR BILL DOES A LOT OF STUFF. AS YOU THINK IT'S A COMPLIMENT -- THAT THIS BILL IN A WE HAVE A TERRIBLE HOUSING CRISIS ON OUR HANDS -- AND THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY GETTING A VERY TANGIBLE SPECIFIC -- SOMETIMES ABUSES. IN THE CASE OF PUTTING A HOUSING MORATORIUM OR A POPULATION COP IT CETERA. WARS -- ITUATIONS WHERE FEES ARE PUT IN PLACE. BETTER SO HIGH THAT ENDS UP MAKING DEVELOPMENT IN FEASIBLE AND PARTICULARLY. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE -- YOU CAN REALLY SEE A PROJECT TO DEATH -- SERVICES -- HAVING A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- FOR HER WORK I KNOW THE AUTHORS TAKING AS AUTHOR AMENDMENTS THE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE AMENDMENTS. AND OUR STAFF WILL OF COURSE CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE AS A BILL MOVES FORWARD TO WORK AND PROVIDE SUPPORT AND SOME RECOMMENDING AND I BOTH -- AS AMENDED. BY POLITICIANS ARE AWESOME YES NO PROBLEM -- I JUST WANT TO SUGGEST I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS INCLUDE THESE BIG POTS OF MONEY THAT WERE A LOT OF DETAIL HAS NOT BEEN INCLUDED. AND I RAISE THE ISSUE UNDER THE OF THE CATEGORY OF INCENTIVIZING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS MADE AND I'M TRYING TO PUSH FOR THAT THE INCENTIVES SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO HOUSING NOT JUST FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REAL TO USE THAT WHATEVER HOWEVER THEY WANT. BUT I'M I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE HOUSING. TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW MORE HOUSING SO I THINK THE FEES ISSUE HERE. COULD BE ONE OF THOSE WAYS IN WHICH THE INCENTIVES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT A WOULD MEAN SOMETHING TO THEM. AND IT WOULD ALSO HELP ON THE HOUSING. FOR THINKING. THANK YOU OKAY -- SENATOR SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE RIGHT. TO HAVE A MOTION TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS AS AMENDED. YEAH.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND CENTERS TOO PROUD TO PRESENT SB SIX ELEVEN WHICH IS TO ABBAS'S THE HOUSING OLDER PERSONS EFFECTIVELY FOR HOPE. TASK FORCE AS PART OF THE STATE'S MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE IN CALIFORNIA THE STATE'S OVER SIXTY FIVE POPULATION WILL NEARLY DOUBLE BY. TWENTY THIRTY THIS DEMOCRAT GRAPHIC SHIFT WILL IMPACT ALL AREAS OF THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM ESPECIALLY HOUSING. WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE BUT IT IS TAKEN IN EVEN GREATER GREATER TOLL AND ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE POPULATION WAFFEN LIFT ON FIXED INCOME. ACCORDING TO THE U. C. L. A. CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH MORE THAN HALF OF LOW INCOME OLDER TENANTS ARE SEVERELY. RENT BURDENED WHICH MEANS SPENDING MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING. THIS DISPARITY BETWEEN HOUSING COSTS AND INCOME IS LADY THESE LEADING TO A RISE IN HOMELESS MISS AMONG OLDER ADULTS. AND THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS THE HOMELESS POPULATION OVER FIFTY FIVE I BELIEVE IS THE FASTEST GROWING POPULATION AMONG THE HOMELESS. AS POLICYMAKERS DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS. ARE LIKELY TO HAVE MULTIPLE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS INCREASED FRAILTY AND LIMITED MOBILITY AND THE NEED FOR IN HOME SERVICES TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. IN THE ABSENCE OF HOUSING ALTERNATIVES MANY WILL BE FORCED IN INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS WHICH NOT ONLY HURTS THEIR FAMILIES BUT LEADS TO ENDING INCREASE COSTS FOR THE STATE. THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS THE HOPE TASK FORCE WILL CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS FROM AROUND THE STATE. TO HELP IDENTIFY POLICY TO HELP OLDER ADULTS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITY DISABILITIES HM PLACE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTEGRATE HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. AND BEST PRACTICES TO DEVELOP INTERGENERATIONAL HOUSING THAT INCLUDES SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR OUR AGING POPULATION. THE TASK FORCE WOULD ALSO SHARE ITS RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. NOW MORETHAN EVER CALIFORNIA NEEDS A THOUGHTFUL PLAN TO MEET THE GROWING NEEDS FOR AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE HOUSING FOR OLDER ADULTS.

CD HAS PROPOSALS WHERE THEY PUT FORWARD A LOT OF FUNDING TO PROPOSITION ONE SEE ANOTHER WAYS WERE BUILT THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF HOUSING.

ANNA ANNA SENIOR PER CAN EASILY BECOME ALMOST SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE DATA THAT COMES FROM THIS NOT ONLY AFFECTS STATE POLICY BUT SERVE AS A BASE FOR WHERE PERHAPS CMS THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID STUDIES COULD SEE.

OUR INTENTION THIS TIME AROUND IS TO A COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL MAKE SURE WHAT'S NEEDED IS ACTUALLY THERE SO THAT'S WHY WE STARTED THIS WAY WERE. HAPPY -- TO DISCUSS ANY. ISSUES WITH THAT BUT AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED WE TOOK THE IDEAS THAT WE HEARD FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE PART OF THIS BILL AND WE INCLUDED THEM ACCORDINGLY AS THEY SAW FIT. SO IT'S NOT REALLY THE TASK FORCE THAT'S S. ASSESSING THE HOUSING ISSUES IT'S HERE THE CATEGORIES OF HOUSING ISSUES GIVE US A REPORT ON THOSE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WRITE A REPORT USING THOSE ISSUES TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE LEGISLATIVELY OR BY THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND WHAT. THE FINDINGS ARE IF THERE'S GOING TO BE IN A RANKING OF THEM OR WHAT THEY SEE IN THE STATE CURRENTLY WHAT CAN BE EXPANDED WHAT NEEDS TO BE NEW WHAT NEEDS TO BE.

MEET OUR CLIMATE EQUITY AND HOUSING GOALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD EVENING -- THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IS CO SPONSORING SB FIVE TWENTY SIX TO HELP ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEED TO REDUCE HARMFUL TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS AND CREATE HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES. IN SHORT LAND USE DECISIONS AND TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS MUST BE VIEWED AS PUBLIC HEALTH DECISIONS. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE LONG SUPPORTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB -- THREE SEVENTY FIVE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND WE'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE SB ONE FIFTY REPORTS FINDINGS THAT WE ARE NOT ON TRACK. THE PROMISE OF HELP YOUR COMMUNITIES ENVISIONED IN OUR NPOS SCS PLANS IS NOT BEING REALIZED TUTOR AND THE VARIETY FACTORS THAT THE SENATOR MENTIONED. THREE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WE CAN ACHIEVE A WIDE RANGE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS INCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND CANCERS. RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND OBESITY RELATED DISEASES AND DIABETES. WE SUPPORT SB FIVE TWENTY SIX AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THE GROWTH IN TRANSPORTATION POLLUTION. IN ADVANCE A CONVERSATION BETWEEN OUR LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL STAKEHOLDERS TO GET US ON TRACK TO PLANNING INVESTING. IN BUILDING HEALTHY AFFORDABLE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. WIENER MIKING KEEPER I WAS THE CEO AT THE SACRAMENTO MPO NGUYEN. SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY FIVE WAS DRAFTED AND PASSED AND SO I I SAW IT FROM. THE CREATION STAGE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION STAGE THE BILL OF THOSE THE STATUTE HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD IN THE STATE AND MANY OF ITS BENEFITS ARE LONG WAVE CHANGE. KIND OF BENEFITS AS YOU CHANGE THE URBAN STRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WILL TAKE AWHILE. TO BE REALIZED BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THE IMPERATIVE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS MUCH MORE. URGENT TODAY THE SCIENCES ADVANCED AND IT'S MUCH MORE OF A CRISIS SITUATION THEN WE UNDERSTOOD A DECADE AGO. I THINK THE BILL THAT -- SENATOR ALLEN AUTHORED TO ESTABLISH SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN SOME MONITORING AND SOME CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT COUPLE YEARS AGO WAS VERY BENEFICIAL I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND FINDINGS THAT WERE IN THE AIR BE REPORT -- A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT CAN HELP THE MP EIGHTEEN MP AS IN THE STATE MOVE FORWARD IS MORE CONSCIOUS FOCUSED AND EFFECTIVE COORDINATION AMONG THE VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES. THE TOUCH THE BEHAVIORS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMETS IN THE REGIONALLY CHEN SEASON I THINK THAT THIS BILL. ACCOMPLISHES THAT IN A GOOD WAY I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FOUR SEATS WILL BE ADDED BY THE LEGISLATURE FORCE OF THE MPO IS IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN BE EPRESENTED -- WITH AN EXPANDED TO CENTRALLY STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. BUT I THINK THAT THE ENHANCED ACCOUNTABILITY THE THE WHOLE STATUE RELIES ON THE THE BASIC DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE I MISS THAT BETTER INFORMATION WILL YIELD -- BETTER ACTIONS AND THIS COMPELS MORE AND MORE INFORMATION. FROM THE MPO IS TO THE STATE IN CARBON PARTICULAR SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE TARGET SET CORRECTLY. TO MEET THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND ALSO WORK FOR THE REGION SO I I SUPPORT THIS SITE WILL ALSO -- CAME FROM A MEETING WITH MAYOR STEINBERG ON THE WAY AND HE WANTED ME TO CONVEY HIS BEST WISHES AND APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR AND THE CHAIR -- AND HE APPRECIATES THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON IMPROVING HIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. OKAY THIRTY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. MATTHEW BAKER PLAYING CONSERVATION LEAGUE IN SUPPORT I'M ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ORGANIZATION CLIMATE PLAN ALSO IN SUPPORT.

EVENING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WERE TOP ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY -- WE DO HAVE A WE HAVE RETAINED OUR OPPOSE POSITION ON THE BILL -- BUT AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DIALOGUE -- IT'S BEEN QUITE PRODUCTIVE IN FACT AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. LAST WEEK OR TWO WEEKS AGO I'M TOOK CARE OF I THINK THE BULK OF OUR MOST SERIOUS CONCERNS. I'M WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED BECAUSE THE BILL DOES -- WE THINK OUR PLACE A AN EMPHASIS ON PROJECT LEVEL V. M. T. THAT WE DON'T THINK IS THE ONLY OR BEST ARBITER OF WHAT -- HOW WE'RE MEETING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD -- TO TO EXPAND OUR PERHAPS THE LISTER TO TALK ABOUT A BETTER WAY TO REALLY MEASURE ON HOW WE'RE MEETING OUR GOALS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL MELISSA ROMERO THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AND SUPPORT POLICIES FOR BEING A LTTLE LATE. NO PROBLEM ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. THERE'S LITTLE SEVEN KNOWN BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND ROOM MOTION BY CENTER ROTH CENTERS SKINNER. THANK YOU TIMES. SENATOR ALLEN I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL [inaudible] I WONDER IF IT HAS ENOUGH TEETH AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE TIME SINCE SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE BMT IS GONE UP CONSIDERABLY YES THE ECONOMY HAS GROWN BUT STILL THE VMT GROWTH IS -- BEEN WHAT A LOT DUE. TO THE WHERE JOB CONCENTRATION IS VERSUS WHERE PEOPLE LEFT TO LIVE NOW TO GET TO THOSE JOBS. AND TRANSIT RIDERSHIP SIGN DOWN IT'S GOING DOWN IN EVERY AREA OF THE STATE SINCE THAT TIME. NO PART OF THAT IS LOCATION AND PART OF THAT IS. A RIDE SHARING RIDE HAILING WAS NOT UBIQUITOUS AT THE POINT THAT WE ADOPTED SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE SO IF PARTNER IF IF OUR MOTIVATION. IS TO GIVE BMT DOWN. AND I'M I'M I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I JUST WONDER IF WE DON'T NEED MORE TEETH VERSES JUST -- MORE COORDINATED MEETINGS WITH US A MORE PARTICIPANTS [inaudible] SENATOR I THE MORE -- THE BILL DID HAVE MORE TEETH IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND OUR TRANSITION CHAIR -- WE WE BASICALLY WE'RE TRYING. SOME OF THE GOALS IN THIS BILL TO STEP. AND THAT ARE CHANGES CHAIR OF WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I THINK COMING OUT OF THE SB ONE DISCUSSION AND AND AND ALL OF THAT HAPPENED THERE. NOW THAT BEING SAID HE HAS. SAID TO ME THAT HE'S ANDERSON TRYING TO HELP US FIGURE OUT A WAY -- TO TO TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL MAYBE MAYBE USE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TEETH. THAN THE STEP TEETH -- YOU KNOW IF I DO THINK SOME OF THE INTENT LANGUAGE AND SOME OF THE MEN'S OF ACTUALLY -- GIVEN SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTH THE BILL BUT I WOULD LOVE TO FIGURE I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU IN A WAY. THAT -- MEETS THE CONCERNS OF OUR TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE -- WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. MAKE SURE THIS IS A REAL THING I MEAN WE ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT TRYING. TO A FACTUAL A DIVISION OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH AS WE ALL KNOW HAS REALLY STRUGGLED. TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT PROMISES TO MAKE -- WHEN WE HAVE AN ENDING THIS IS AND I'M NOT TRYING? TO BE POINT FINGERS AT AGENCIES RIGHT NOW BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME CRITICISM THAT. THEY ARE THESE POLICIES MAY HAVE. EXACERBATED VMT BECAUSE OF LIMITING HOUSING IN SOME AREAS AND YOU KNOW I NOT SURE I HAVEN'T NECESSARILY SEEN THE DETAILED ANALYSIS ON IT BUT THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT THAT. AND I DIDN'T MENTION THIS IN MY BILL BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES WERE FACING IS THIS RIDICULOUS SUPER COMMUTES. WITH MANY CALIFORNIANS NOW. DRIVING EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED MILES EACH WAY. FOR TWO HUNDRED MILES ROUND TRIP FOR FURTHER TO GO TO WORK YEAH -- I AND I WONDER IF -- AN EXPLICIT VMT REDUCTION GOAL. FOR IN A SIMILAR WAY THAT WE'VE DONE GHG REDUCTION GOALS. THAT IF A OR B.. HAD TO SET ONE AND THEN ORIENTED THEIR POLICIES ARE OTHER AGENCIES HAD TO SET ONE THEN THEY'D BE ORIENTING THEIR POLICIES LOOKING THROUGH THAT LANDS BUT THIS IS JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT I DON'T WANT TO DELAY THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] FEDERAL OKAY. ALLOW ME TO DELAY THE COMMITTEE -- I'M JUST TRUE CENTER ALLEN IF WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO REDUCE THESE. EMTS THAT. THAT THAT THE IDEAS ARE BEING PROPOSED OR TO TO REDUCE LANES AT CONGESTION PRICING TOLL FREE. INCREASE TOLL FEES A TENER. AND I'M JUST WONDERING HOW DOES THAT HELP THE POOR AND THOSE YOUNG COUPLES THAT ARE YOU KNOW DRIVING TILL THEY QUALIFY. WRITTEN REDUCE THIS I'M JUST LOOKING AT MY NUMBER WHERE YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE WHETHER REDUCING LANES WITH WHERE YOU HAD TO SEND IT'S IN MY REPUBLICAN STAFF REPORTER APOLOGIST TIMES STAFF REPORT THAT WE HAVE YOUR BUT IT WOULD THAT BE A A SOLUTION IS THAT. IS THAT WHAT. TO WE'LL BE AYE WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THE BILL -- IT MEANS YOU MAY BE. AT I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR CABLE AND FORGIVE ME BUT IT'S IN MY NOTICE AND I I JUST SIT HERE IT'S A VOICE WE'RE GONNA REDUCE LANES AS A STRATEGY THAT ACTUALLY COMPOUNDS THE GREENHOUSE GAS. PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'RE JUST PHONE EVERYBODY DOWN. BUT I APOLOGIZE IF IT'S NOT IN THE STAFF THIS IS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO SAVE HOUSING AND JOBS NEXT. TO NEXT TO EACH OTHER AS I'M JUST BEING SENSITIVE TO THE GROUP WITH SENATOR SKINNER JUST SAT. GETTING SUCH LONG DISTANCES NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO WHO RIGHT YOU KNOW SO WE'RE ALL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS PROBLEM AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A FOR MAKING THEIR GUARDIAN NOT A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX. THAT'S I ALL I NEEDED TO IF ANYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE ACTUALLY TRY TO MAKE IT SIMPLER RIGHT WE'RE TRYING ACTUALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE LIVE BE ABLE TO LIVE NEARBY WHERE THEY GO TO WORK AND WHICH WILL VERY MUCH ADDRESS THE THE SOCIAL EQUITY ISSUES YOU'RE RAISING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. ENTER SO COMMON -- SOMEONE A BANK -- THE CHAIR OF THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS CHAIR OF A DIFFERENT -- THE AUTHOR -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. FORWARD AND I AGREE. WITH THE AUTHOR WAS CENTER SKINNER DIED ON THE PROMISE OF PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO TRY TO ALIGN. LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION AND AND REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS HAS. WE WE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE PUT OUT. WE'RE GONNA PUTTING OUT BLUEPRINTS AND WE DON'T ALWAYS ON PUT THE TEETH INTO A TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS. AND PART OF IT -- IN THIS AREA. IS A LAND USES IS REALLY HARD ISSUE AND I I I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE ALL WE ALL SEEN IT -- AND CITIES DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO -- AND ONE A THE OTHER SIDE PHONE SELVES FOR ONE OF YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WAN TO PUT HOUSING ON LAND USE HAS BEEN. A VERY DECENTRALIZED THING IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT'S STARTING TO CHANGE AS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS LAND USE DECISIONS. I HAVE STATEWIDE IMPACT SUCH AS FOR AFFORDABILITY BUT AROUND -- CARBON EMISSIONS IN OUR EFFORTS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE -- AND SO WE DO NEED -- TEETH WE I MEAN WE WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO TRY -- TO PUT SOME MORE TEA FACTIONS OF THE BILL AND I KNOW -- WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THAT AND AND I HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS FOR TEETH CENTER SO IT -- SO ANYWAY HODA THIS DOESN'T GO IN I RECOMMENDATION AS AMENDED AND WE PROMOTION BY SENATOR RICK ROSS. AND SO -- CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE BY I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS A GREAT DEAL AND I I THINK THIS IS ULTIMATELY ALL ABOUT TRYING TO BE THE PROMISE OF SB THREE THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS IT VITALLY IMPORTANT -- STATEMENT OF OF GOALS THAT REALLY DO ADDRESS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THIS COMMITTEE WORKS ON EVERY EVERY DAY SO -- APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL AND AND VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE NAY VOTE. OKAY -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL FIVE TWENTY SIX BY SENATOR ALLEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. AND REFER THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR WIENER. HI WIENER I MORRELL. MORRELL NO BATES. BATES SNOW COVER. THEY'RE ALSO. MCGUIRE. MCGUIRE I AM MORE LOCK. WELL I KNOW ROUGH. ROTH AYE SKINNER. SKINNER I AM BURKE. NUMBER FIVE HUSKY [inaudible] CASSIE I NORMAN. OKAY -- THE VOTED SIX TO THREE AND WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. OKAY WILL NOW GO TO SENATOR MORE LOCK. ITEM THIRTEEN AS TO SEVEN FIFTY FOUR THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH YEAH THE RESEARCHER HERE. ONE DOWN AND AND AND ORANGE COUNTY. AND WE HAVE DIFFICULTY CONVINCING PEOPLE TO COME IN FOR OUR BOARDS SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D ONLY HAVE AS MANY CANDIDATES AS OPEN POSITIONS. SO WHY VOTE ON A SINGLE SLAVE. YES PLEASE SEVEN FIVE FOUR SAVES ON MAILING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IT'S DONE FOR NUMEROUS MUNICIPALITIES. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MENTIONED IN YOUR STAFF REPORT ONE COMMUNITY MY DISTRICT HAS HAD SIX UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS FOR THREE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. WITH TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SENIOR ADLT UNITS. THAT SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COSTS AND FOR A COMMUNITY LIVING ON RETIREMENT SAVINGS I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I STOLE THIS BILL FROM SENATOR RAFI BRAND IT LAST YEAR -- HAD A FRIEND IN IT AND LAGUNA WOODS -- WHO IS NO LONGER THERE BUT WE WANT TO PICK IT UP AGAIN THAT WAS SENATE BILL? ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT AND A WIN THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WITH ONLY ONE NO VOTE. IT WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THIS -- EXPENSIVE AND UNNECESSARY PROCEDURE SHOULD BE RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THAT SPECIFIC COMMUNITY BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE CHANGE IN THE DAVIS STIRLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT. SO. WHY MAKE SUCH A? SHE KNEW I MAKE SUCH A SMALL MINISTERIAL CHANGE OPTIONAL -- TO HOLD AN ELECTION IS EASY HAVE MORE CANDIDATES THAN AVAILABLE POSITIONS IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE FACT THEY'RE JUST A SINGLE SITE THEN PLEASE APPLY AND RUN. AND GET MORE THAN THE OPENING SO THEN YOU DO HAVE AN ELECTION -- SO WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S AN EASY SOLUTION -- IF IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT NOT HAVING TO VOTE ON A SINGLE SLATE WHICH IS SORT OF REDUNDANT. SO I WENT TO A ENCOURAGE HOMEOWNERS THAT LIVE IN -- HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS TO RUN BUT COLLEAGUES LET'S SEND SB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR TO OUR NEW GOVERNOR. AND LET'S GIVE THE FIFTY THOUSAND IMPACTED COMMUNITIES A BUDGET SAVING OPPORTUNITY THEY'LL BE THANKFUL FOR I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITNESSES PRESENT. AND THEIR THROUGH ILLNESSES ARE. TOO ONE TWO THREE OKAY SO. OKAY GREAT. THANK YOU. CRACKLE FOR ARMED GOOD EVENING -- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JEFF PARKER I'M THE NEW CEO AT LAGUNA -- WOODS VILLAGE -- IT'S A COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT AS INDICATED OF TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HOMES AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS. WERE THE SPONSOR OF SB. SEVEN FIFTY FOUR OUR MEMBERS LIVE ON MODEST INCOMES. FIXED INCOMES AND IN MANY CASES WE STRIVE TO BE FRUGAL AND FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN SEEK THOSE EFFICIENCIES AND COSTS AND PREPARATION THIS BILL IS A PRODUCT OF THOSE EFFORTS. AS INDICATED. WE HAVE THREE GOVERNING BOARDS WHICH OFTEN TIMES HAVE PEOPLE. FOR WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR OPENINGS BUT THE THE VOLUNTEER ELEMENT OF THIS IS BEEN RESTRICTIVE IN THE SENSE THAT WE CAN'T GET PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN ONE ANSWERING ON THESE BOARDS. SO OFTEN TIMES WE JUST GET THREE NECESSARY FOR THE FOR NECESSARY TO BE ELECTED AND BY MOVING TOWARDS SB FIFTY FOUR IT'S GOING TO SAVE -- ON BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY TO SENATOR MENTIONED -- THE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IS THE APPROXIMATE COST OF OUR LAST THREE ELECTIONS FILL IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE SPENT A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR LECTIONIS WHICH WE HAD NO MORE CANDIDATES THAN ON THE SLATE. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT SHOULD BE SAVED FOR OUR RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEREFORE WE ASK FOR YOU SHOULD SUPPORT WITH REDUCTION SB. FIFTY FOUR GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LEARN ON HUGE COME BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE ALSO IN SUPPORT FOR THE REASONS STATED WE BELIEVE. THAT THIS WILL SAVE ASSOCIATIONS A GREAT DEAL OF COST BUT ALSO PROVIDES THE PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE RE ENCOURAGED TO RUNNING CAN RUN IF THEY WANT -- TO SO YOUR SPECS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER WATER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS IN SUPPORT FOR THE REASONS STATED. OKAY AN ADDITIONAL SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD SENATOR WIENER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I MARJORIE MURRAY AGAIN. CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW -- HAS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS IDEA HAS BEEN. BROUGHT TO THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THIS IS THE FOURTH OR FIFTH ITERATION OF THIS IDEA. THAT THE ACCLAMATION CAN BE THE TOOL FOR SEATING BOARD DIRECTORS. AND WE HAVE THE SAME OBJECTIONS TO THIS BILL AS WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST. I ONE OF STRESS JUST ONE POINT ABOUT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS. WHICH I'VE ALSO MADE IN OUR LETTER. AND THAT IS THAT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE NOT COUNTRY CLUBS. THEY'RE NOT NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION SAID PUT ON FOURTH OF JULY PICNICS THIS IS ANOTHER LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT LIKE A SPECIAL DISTRICT OR A SCHOOL BOARD OR A CITY COUNCIL OR A COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN FACT SOME OF THEIR POWERS. EXCEED THOSE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE BEING THE ASSOCIATION'S RIGHT BEFORE CLOSE ON SOMEONE WHO FALLS BEHIND. ON ASSOCIATION ASSESSMENTS. BECAUSE OF THEIR GOVERNMENTAL POWERS. THE EXISTING STATUTES GOVERNING ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS ARE MODELED ON THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS COLD AND WITH GOOD REASON. AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE POWERS INVESTED IN ASSOCIATION BOARDS. ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD. FOR ACCLAMATION IS THAT SCHOOL BOARD TO USE A SPECIAL DISTRICTS USE THE CITY COUNCIL'S USER. THAT IS AN INEXACT ANALOGY. FOR ONE THING QUALIFICATIONS AGAIN FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SPECIAL THE SCHOOL BOARDS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND SO ON THOSE ARE SET BY. LAW THOSE ARE SET BY STATUTE. WHEREAS IN THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION ENVIRONMENT QUALIFICATIONS ARE SET BY THE INCUMBENTS WHO ARE ALREADY SITTING. ON THE BOARD. THIS IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE WHICH MY COLLEAGUE TOM SERVER WILL ADDRESS AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DETAIL. A SECOND IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE ELECTIONS IN THE PUBLIC ARENA. ARE EXECUTED BY A REGISTRAR OF VOTERS A DISINTERESTED THIRD PARTY THEY ARE NOT. EXECUTED BY AGAIN THE INCUMBENTS WHICH IS A SITUATION AND THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION. SO. I GUESS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE IS THAT. AS THE BILL IS WRITTEN THE DECISION TO SEAT BOARD DIRECTORS BY ACCLAMATION IS A PRIVATE. ONE MEANING IT'S MADE BY THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS TOGETHER WITH THE BOARD THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ELECTORATE. TO DISAGREE TO OBJECT TO DEMAND THE ELECTION AS THEY THEY HAVE THAT RIGHT WITH A SCHOOL BOARD. SO HOW WE ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS BECAUSE OF THE POWERS INVESTED IN AN ASSOCIATION BOARD. AND BECAUSE WE HAVE CATALOGUED TOO MANY INSTANCES OF INDIVIDUALS PUTTING THEMSELVES FORWARD. TO RUN FOR A BOARD BUT BECAUSE THE BOARD SETS THE QUALIFICATIONS THEY ARE TOO EASILY DISMISSED. MY COLLEAGUE TOM SERVER WILL ADDRESS A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES HERE AND ONE IS THE COST ISSUE. THANK YOU AND AGAIN TIME SIR I'M ON THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AT THE CENTER. GOING ON SEVEN YEARS AND SO I CAN TELL YOU. THAT THE POSITIONS AT THE CENTER TAKES. ON LEGISLATION EITHER IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION. THOSE POSITIONS ARE BASED ON THE INFORMATION THE COMPLAINTS THE COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM HOMEOWNERS ALL AROUND THE STATE. AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION REPEATEDLY. THAT IN MANY HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS AROUND THE STATE. AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE SPONSOR IS NECESSARILY ONE OF THESE BUT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS AROUND THE STATE. ARE OFTEN CAPTIVE THE SMALL GROUP OF INCUMBENTS WHO HOLD ON TO THEIR POWER AND PASS. RULES AND SO FORTH IN THEIR FAVOR. AND THAT THESE ABUSIVE PRACTICES IT'S A CONTINUUM THAT STARTS WITH THE WRITING OF THE RULES FOR HOW YOU RUN AN ELECTION. AND IT CONTINUES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION THAT THE CONDUCT OF THE ELECTION. AND WE HEARD OF SUCH PRACTICES AS WRITING. OF QUALIFICATIONS THAT EXCLUDE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION AND ARE TRYING TO GET ON THE BOARD. AND TARA THE TARGET THOSE PEOPLE AND PREVENT THEM FROM RUNNING SO IN THE FACE OF THAT IT'S IRONIC TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH. CANDIDATES IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS. OF THESE PRACTICES ARE DONE UNDER THE RADAR SO THAT THE MEMBERSHIP IS NOT OFTEN NOT AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON AND SO THIS BILL WHICH WOULD ALLOW SEATING BY ACCLAMATION. IT CONTINUES TO OR ALLOWS THIS CONTINUUM OF ABUSE TO CONTINUE AND IN FACT MAKES IT WORSE. THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL NOTES THAT. ONCE THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS DETERMINES THAT. THE NUMBER OF NOMINEES IS NOT MORE THAN NUMBER OF VACANCIES. THE EXACT LANGUAGES. THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES SHALL BE CONSIDERED ELECTED BY ACCLAMATION IF THE ASSOCIATION FOLLOW THE PROCEDURE THE NOTICES. THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY INDICATION THAT THE BOARD HAS TO TAKE AN ACTION IT JUST HAPPENS AND AGAIN. UNDER THE RADAR SO THAT'S WHAT CAUSES US SUCH SO MUCH CONCERNED. ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ARGUMENTS PUT FORTH IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. OF ONE OF THESE IS THE LOGIC OF WHY HOLD ELECTION IF THERE AREN'T ENOUGH CANDIDATES WHO IS EQUAL CANDIDATES HIS VACANCIES. AND THAT LOGIC IS. I'VE ADDRESS THAT IN. SHOWING THAT THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THE CONTINUE. THE OTHER ANOTHER -- ARGUMENT IS THE COST. NOW BEGINNING WITH THE VERY FIRST BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED I THINK FOUR YEARS AGO THE COST. PENCILS OUT TO ABOUT A DOLLAR PER MEMBER. PER ROOM PER A ELECTION. AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE CONFIRMED I MEAN WE HAD THE SAME BILL BEFORE YOU SAME SPONSOR LAST YEAR. AND THE FIGURES THAT ARE QUOTED IN THE ANALYSIS ARE ACOSTA SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS FOR THREE ELECTIONS IN ONE PARTICULAR CYCLE. AND WITH THE MEMBERSHIP OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THAT CANCELS OUT TO A DOLLAR EIGHTY PER MEMBER. TO MAINTAIN DEMOCRACY I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S TOO MUCH OF A PRICE TO PAY -- THE OTHER IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IS IN THE PUBLIC ELECTIONS [inaudible] ARENA. THE RULES ARE NOT WRITTEN BY THE BOARD THAT'S BEING ELECTED OR THE CITY COUNCIL NOR IS IT. OR IS THE ELECTION CONDUCTED BY THOSE PEOPLE BUT IN THIS CONTEXT IT IS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK THIS BILL -- IS. A DANGEROUS ONE AND WE URGE YOU KNOW [inaudible] FOR CRITICS. WHEN ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION? CASEY MEMORY BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. IN A ROW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE TO ME. I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE OPPONENTS IS THIS I KNOW IT FROM THE ANALYSIS AND I KNEW FROM LAST YEAR THAT. VERSIONS OF THIS BILL BEFORE I GOT INVOLVED IN IT. INCLUDED PROVISIONS THAT THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE NOTICE TO ALL MEMBERS AT LEAST TWENTY DAYS BEFORE DECLARING ELECTION UNCONTESTED. IN OTHER WORDS HEY HOMEOWNERS WE'VE GOT FIVE CANDIDATES FOR FIVE VACANCIES. WE'RE GOING TO DECLARE THIS UNCONTESTED. AND THAT DIDN'T APPEAR TO SATISFY THE OPPONENTS TO THAT PARTICULAR BILL BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAY IS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SO MY QUESTION IS THIS IS THERE ANYTHING. THAT WOULD REMOVE YOUR OPPOSITION. TO AN ELECTION BY ACCLAMATION. WHEN THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES EQUALS THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES? THAT WAS ACTUALLY OUR AMENDMENT. WHAT THE ANALYSIS SAID IT DID NOT SATISFY THE? OPPOSE OPPOSITION CONCERNED SO NO TO THE MAYES BILL I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT WAS OUR MEN WITH THAT WHAT THE AND CAUSE INCREASE I'M READING THE ANALYSIS THAT PROVISION HOWEVER DID NOT SATISFY OPPOSITION CONCERNS. MAYBE YOU WERE THE OPPOSITION HAS SENATOR WIENER DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER THAT OR DOES YOUR QUESTION -- WELL WHAT THAT RAISES SENATOR ROTH IS THE BROADER. IS THE INHERENT DEFECT. OF ACCLAMATION WHICH IS. THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MEMBERSHIP. TO OBJECT. AND EVEN IN THE FOR TALKING ABOUT A SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION AND THIS IS IN THE ANALYSIS. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR VOTERS WHO LIVE IN IN A SCHOOL BOARD DISTRICT. TO GET UP A PETITION UP AT A CERTAIN LEVEL AND DEMAND THAT THE ELECTION BE HELD. AND THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. THERE HAS BEEN NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT THEY MANY VERSIONS. OF THIS OF THE ACCLAMATION BILLS WITHIN LET ME RE AS MY QUESTION BECAUSE THIS OF COURSE IS THE SACRAMENTO WAY AND WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO THIS BILL. TO ALLOW ACCLAMATION. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHERE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES EQUALS THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE RIGHT TO VOTE FROM THE MEMBERSHIP. WHICH IS THE INHERENT DEFECT OF THIS APPROACH BUT ISN'T VOTING. IN AN ELECTION WHERE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES EQUALS NUMBER OF VACANCIES. AN IDLE ACT [inaudible] SO. TO EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE VOTING WORKS IS IS THERE ANYTHING WATER THE OP WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS. AT THAT POINT FOR A VOTER IN A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WHERE THE NUMBER. OF CANDIDATES EQUALS THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES IT'S NOT JUST NUMBER OF CANDIDATES EQUALS NUMBER OF VACANCIES IT'S THE TOTALITY OF THIS APPROACH WHERE YOU HAVE WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE. LAID OUT IN OUR LETTER AND WHICH I THINK -- HERREN HAS LAID OUT IN THE ANALYSIS WHERE YOU HAVE. THE INCUMBENTS ESTABLISHING THE QUALIFICATIONS. WHERE YOU HAVE THE INSPECTOR DETERMINING THAT? THESE PEOPLE ARE QUALIFIED AND THE INCUMBENTS ARE ALSO IMPLEMENTING AN EXIT CHOOSING THE INSPECTOR. AND IMPLEMENTING THE ELECTION SO IT'S NOT JUST A SIMPLE. WE'VE GOT FIVE WARM BODIES TO FILL FIVE VACANCIES. IT'S THE TOTALITY OF THIS PROCESS. SO IT'S NOT JUST ACCLAMATION IT'S THE WHOLE PACKAGE. THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE MA'AM THANK YOU THANK. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY -- SEEING NINE AND I SOMETHING WE MOTION. IN A ROTH OF THE BILL OKAY -- WE HAVE A MOTION -- AND THAT IS -- JUDICIARY. OKAY FEDERAL UP WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I I GUESS. WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO WAYS TO LOOK AT A HOMEOWNERS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ONE IS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM AND THEY'RE TRYING DESPERATELY TO MAINTAIN CONTROL AND KEEP OTHERS OUT. AND THERE'S THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE'RE JUST GLAD PEOPLE ARE RUNNING AND SPENDING AN EVENING A MONTH. TO MEET WITH THE BOARD LISTEN TO THE COMPLAINTS. I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING ON A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION BOARD ONE OF THE SEMINARS I WENT. TO TOLD ME THAT -- MOST BOARD PRESIDENT TO MOVE OUT WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO AFTER THEY'VE SERVED BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH OF PEOPLE CALL IN THE MIDDLE MIGHT SAY IN A MY NEWSPAPERS WET OR THIS OR THAT. SO -- IT'S IS BUT AS LOCAL AS IT GETS AND IS AS FRUSTRATING AS IT IS. AND SO I'M I'M BUT IN THE SCHOOL. AND I'M EXCITED TO HAVE PEOPLE WILLING TO RUN AND IF I HAD MORE CANDIDATES THAN POSITIONS THAT'S REALLY GREAT NEWS -- BUT IF YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF CANDIDATES OR LESS. THEN WHY ARE WE SPENDING THE TIME AND EFFORT -- YOU KNOW I I HEAR THE ARGUMENTS. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE'S A SINGLE PLAY PLEASE GET PEOPLE TO RUN. OR MAYBE MAYBE PUT UP THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE FOR THE MAILING IF YOU HAVE THE TWENTY THOUSAND OR OR MAYBE MAYBE WE HAD A STEP BACK AND SAY OKAY FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. SERVING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FIFTY FIVE AN OLDER LIKE LAGUNA WOODS MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE EXEMPTED. BUT FOR CRYING ABOUT I GUESS I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW HOMEOWNERS YOU'RE ADULTS NO THE FILING PERIOD NO THE RULES AND AND VIOLENT TIME. OF WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF CRITICAL DATES IN OUR LIVES LIKE APRIL FIFTEENTH APRIL FIFTEEN APRIL TEN APRIL SEPT A DECEMBER TEN WE GOT A PAIR PROPERTY TAXES WE GOT IT. DO OUR THING OR WE HAVE PENALTIES. SO I I SEE NOTHING HERE THAT'S UNDER THE RADAR. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE IN THE YEAR TWO ANYA RAMP UP AND GET PEOPLE INVOLVED. SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I I THINK WE OWE A IS YOU KNOW A LOT OF ASSOCIATIONS A LITTLE RELIEF HERE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB. SEVEN FIVE FOUR OKAY MOTION THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL SEVENTY FOUR BY SENATOR MORLOCK MOTIONS TO PASS AND REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY SENATOR WIENER HI WIENER I AM MORALE. MORRELL AYE BATES AYE BATES AYE CAMERO. GIVER I DRAWS -- MCGUIRE MORLOCK BY [inaudible] I ROUGH. ROTH AYE SKINNER. NUMBER. NUMBER I A CASKEY. THE VOTED SEVEN ZERO KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS -- AND THEN WE'LL GO TO OUR FINAL BILL TODAY WHICH IS -- SB ONE FORTY TWO BY YOURS TRULY. ALL HAVE AND THEIR CATTLE OVER TO SENATOR AROUND [inaudible] ALWAYS. WITH THE WORLD LOS WELCOME SENATOR ARE YOU READY. READY TO GO SB ONE FORTY TO HIT. FIVE THANK YOU -- COLLEAGUES -- THIS BILL -- FOR THOSE WHO WERE HERE LAST YEAR SHOULD BE FAMILIAR -- THE SMELL WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST. LAST YEAR AND UNFORTUNATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR SO WE ARE BACK. AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES OP POSED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE SIX OF ANALYSIS. REGARDING THE BUILDING CODE -- SECTION. SB ONE FORTY TWO IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE. THE NEW MOTHERS ARE ABLE TO RETURN O WORK -- AND ALSO -- EXPRESS MILK SO THEY COULD BREASTFEED. THEIR CHILDREN TO MANY WORKING WOMEN PARTICULARLY -- LOWER WAGE ARE WORKING WOMEN ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE TO I BREASTED MY CHILD AND NOT RETURN TO WORK WHERE DO I RETURN THE WORK AND THEN. STOP BREAST FEEDING HAVE TO PURCHASE EXPENSIVE FORMULA -- AND SO FORTH WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE HUGE. HEALTH AND OTHER BENEFITS -- TO BREAST FEEDING. AND WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. TO HELP -- WORKING FAMILIES AND TO HELP WOMEN RETURNED TO WORK WHEN THEY CHOOSE NOT FOR SAID DECISION ON THEM OR FOR SOME TO DELAY -- RETURNING TO WORK -- THE BILL -- WILL REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS PROVIDE A PRIVATE SPACE OFFER LACTATION. AS A TABLE CHAIR -- AN ELECTRICAL OUTLET. AND A SINGLE REFRIGERATOR -- CLOSE BY. IT'S A VERY FLEXIBLE BILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO EMPLOYER EMPLOYERS -- IN TERMS OF HOW THEY PROVIDE THE SPACE PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR TEMPORARY SPACES -- PARTICULARLY FOR EXAMPLE AND SMALL RETAIL SPACES THAT ALLOWS MULTI TENANT BUILDINGS TO SHARE. A SPACE. IT PROVIDES. A PARTICULAR -- FLEXIBILITY FOR CERTAIN SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES LIKE AGRICULTURE -- AND OTHERS. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY ARE TO A PARISH FROM LEGALLY TO WORK ROBBINS AUSTELL FROM THE CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION ENDEAVOR ALBERT IS A REGISTERED NURSE AND LACTATION CONSULTANTS. HI GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS JULIA PARISH I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK WHICH IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF LOW WAGE WORKERS. WE HAVE A WORKING FAMILY HEALTH PLAN AND WE HEAR FROM THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES A YEAR WHO FACE THESE ISSUES OF THE WORKPLACE -- SIMPLY PUT SB ONE FORTY TO ENSURE IS THAT LACTATING PARENTS CAN. FEED THEIR BABIES WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AS PARENTS AND IT REALLY IS SIMPLE IT'S NOT ASKING FOR TOO MUCH IT'S NOT TOO ONEROUS TO HAVE A SPACE. IT'S CLEAN AND SAFE FOR A WOMAN TO EXPRESS MILK AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AND WE KNOW THAT LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS ARE A PROBLEM OF WORK. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SAYS THAT ONE THIRD OF WORKING PARENTS REPORT THAT THEY HAVE NO BREAST FEEDING SUPPORT WORK. AND PARENTS WITH LOWER INCOMES HAVE REPORT -- PROBLEMS AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE. IN FACT MOTHERS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN ARE THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE US WORK FORCE AND MOST MOTHERS REPORT THAT THEY WANT TO BRED BREAST FEED. IN CALIFORNIA 94% OF NEW PARENTS START OFF BREAST FEEDING IN THE HOSPITAL BUT AT THREE MONTHS POST PARTUM ONLY 19% CONTINUE TO DO SO. AND THE SIMPLE SOLUTION IS TO PROVIDE WORKPLACE ACCOMMODATIONS -- SO. HEY I ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT EMPLOYERS CAN EXPECT A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT LACTATION SUPPORT LEADS TO FEWER SIXTIES INCREASES MORALE -- IMPROVES -- PRODUCTIVITY AND LOYALTY SO WITH WITH -- THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ANY OTHER -- IN SUPPORT. YES IF. YOU GUYS. WE WERE ALL TALKING AND COMMENTS OF MATHEMATICS MY NAME IS DEBBIE ALBERT AND I'M A CLINICAL NURSE THREE LACTATION CONSULTANT UC DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER I'M THE MAIN LACTATION CONSULTANT THAT SUPPORTS. THE PROGRAM OUT THE HEALTH CENTER ON IN SACRAMENTO AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID WAS WE FOLLOW CALIFORNIA LAW WE FOLLOW UC SYSTEM WHY WE ALSO FOLLOW A UC DAVIS. OF A LAW THAT WE CREATED SO WE HAVE ALL OF OUR STUFF IN A ROW AND WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DIFFERENT -- ROOMS ACROSS THE CAMPUS AND OF THE HEALTH CENTER AND ONE OF THE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE IS A BUILDING CODE. THAT REQUIRES THAT NUMBER ONE IF WE BUILD A NEW BUILDING THAT THERE WILL BE A LACTATION ACCOMMODATION IN THAT BUILDING. AND TO KNOW EMPLOYEES SHOULD HAVE TO WALK MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES TO GET TO A PUMPING ROOM. AND THAT IS A MODEL POLICY BUT IT'S A GOOD ONE AND WE FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE A SITUATION WHERE WE SUPPORT AS MANY WOMEN AS POSSIBLE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY OUR LOW INCOME MOMS BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH LOW HEALTH IN MANY OF THESE SITUATIONS AND THEY NEED A WAY IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH STANDARDS AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT I'M ROBBIE GONZALEZ DOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION AND OUR VISION IS THAT ALL PARENTS CAN MEET THEIR BREASTFEEDING GOALS IN CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANNA READ -- AN EXPERT FROM AN EXCERPT FROM A LETTER THAT I RECEIVED FROM A MOM NAMED CERRA I SPOKE TO HER. ON FRIDAY AND SHE SENT ME -- ABOUT HER SITUATION SHE WANTED ME TO SHARE THIS. THERE ARE MANY DAYS WHEN I WALKED OVER TO THE MOTHER'S ROOM IT WAS OFTEN IN USE AND I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR MY TURN. WHEN I ASKED ABOUT ADDING A RESERVATION OPTION TO THE ROOM I WAS TOLD RESERVATIONS DON'T WORKING THERE WAS CONCERN WE MIGHT ALL NEEDED AT THE SAME TIME? EVEN AFTER I EXPLAINED IF YOU'RE UNABLE TO PUMP WHEN YOU NEED YOU CAN LOSE YOUR MILK SUPPLY AND GET INFECTIONS IT WAS STILL TONIGHT. I TALK TO OTHER MOMS USING THE ROOM AND THEY WERE TOO FRUSTRATED WITH ALWAYS HAVING TO WAIT AND NEVER KNOWING WHEN THE ROOM WOULD BE AVAILABLE ONE OF THEM DOUBLES AS SHE HAD TO USE THE LOCKER ROOM TO PUMP IN BECAUSE THEY WERE SO AND GORGE AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND COULDN'T. WAIT ANY LONGER HERE WE ALL WERE WITH THE DESIGNATED MOTHER'S ROOM BUT IN REALITY IT WASN'T ACCESSIBLE AND MOST OF US NEEDED IT WE WERE ALL DEDICATED EMPLOYEES. WANTING TO BE AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE BUT OUR COMPANY WAS NOT GIVING US THE TOOLS TO DO IT AND ABLE TO RESERVE A SPACE WAS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO JUGGLE. A PUMP. OR ARE PUMP TIME WITH A MEETINGS I OFTEN HAD TO COME MY PUMP TIME SHORT BECAUSE THE TIME THE MOTHER'S ROOM WAS AVAILABLE. I WOULD ONLY I WOULD HAVE LESS THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES TO PUMP AND GET TO MY MEETING I AM JUST ONE WORKING MOTHER THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN LIKE ME. STRIVING TO BE THE BEST PROFESSIONALS POSSIBLE WERE STARTING A FAMILY WITH THE CURRENT LAW AS BEING SO VAGUE WORKING MOTHERS RIGHT TO LACTATION ACCOMMODATION. IN THE WORKPLACE IS DIMINISHED AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT SHE WENT BACK TO WORK ON THE BABIES ABOUT THREE MONTHS OLD. HER MILK SUPPLY JUST WENT AWAY AFTER FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE STRESS OF THIS AND BEING TOLD THAT HER -- REQUESTS WERE OUT OF LINE AND NOW SHE'S -- PRETTY UPSET ABOUT THE SITUATION AND DOES WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR OTHER MOTHERS AND SHE DOES DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR GOOD WORKPLACE POLICY AND FOR ACCOMMODATIONS ADEQUATE ACCOMMODATIONS ACT. I THANK YOU. ANY OTHER IN SUPPORT. THAT NAME AN ORGANIZATION AND I AND I'M A SILLY OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. KAREN FOR EARLY CALIFORNIA WITH ASSOCIATION CO SPONSOR THE BILL IN SUPPORT SPECIALLY FOR THE LOW INCOME ON THANK YOU. VIDEO BORN REPRESENTING AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AND SUPPORT. ANY QUESTIONS FROM A CULT OPPOSITION SORRY. HI GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS LAURA CURTIS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS EVENING I'M WE WORK TIRELESSLY ON THIS BILL LAST YEAR AS WELL AS LEMONS. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET TO A POINT WITH THE MOANS BILL THAT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ND THE BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS. IN OPPOSITION -- ACTUALLY SUPPORTED THAT BILL AND WE FEEL LIKE THAT BILL HASN'T EVEN HAD A TIME TO BE IMPLEMENTED BEFORE SB ONE FORTY TWO IS NOW EXPANDING ON THAT BILL AS WELL AS CHANGING -- FOR A PROVISIONS OF THAT BILL THAT WERE NEGOTIATED I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED SOME PROPOSALS FOR AMENDING. THEBUILDING CODE PROVISION UNFORTUNATELY THE INDIVIDUAL FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION IS UNABLE TO BE HERE THIS EVENING DUE TO AN UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCE -- BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE THAT THAT AMENDMENTS WERE NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE OVERALL CONCERNS I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT LAST YEAR WHEN THE BILL MADE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK ALL OF THE BUILDING CODE PROVISIONS WERE ACTUALLY AMENDED OUT OF THIS BILL. AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE -- AND ADDITIONALLY OVERALL THERE'S LEGITIMATE CONCERNS WITH THE LABOR CODE PROVISIONS THAT ARE ADDED OR THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THIS BILL -- BECAUSE RETALIATION FOR LACTATION ACCOMMODATION IS ALREADY A PART OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING OVERSEAS LIKE -- TO OVERSEAS DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION BASED ON SEX -- ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE THE TWO TWO SIX WADE VIOLATIONS WHICH ALLOW FOR ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE PENALTIES I WHICH MEANS THAT EMPLOYERS WOULD BE MORE INCLINED IN THE SITUATION TO TRY AND REGULATE THE REST BREAKS THAT EMPLOYEES TAKE. WITH REGARD TO LACTATION AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY REALLY WANTS IS THE EMPLOYER GETTING TOO INVOLVED IN ONE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO LACTATE. I'M FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE TO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- AGAIN WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL WITH THEM -- FOR NOW STOOD ON THE TO THE SECOND YEAR AND WE DO APPRECIATE ALL THE TIME THE STAFF IS GIVEN US THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED APPRECIATE TIME. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION AND OTHER BUSINESSES SORRY MR VICE CHAIR YOU -- HEARD THIS ALREADY PREVIOUSLY IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPONENTS OF OF LACTATION ACCOMMODATION WE ACTIVELY SUPPORTED PRIOR LEGISLATION AS WELL AS A. B.. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX LAST YEAR OUR CONCERN IS THE IMPACT ON BUSINESS. SENATOR WIENER DID DROP THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THERE WAS IN THE BILL BUT BECAUSE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE REFERENCED BY MISS CURTIS OF THE LABOR CODE. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THESE ARE SUBJECT THEN TO A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT PAGA WHICH GIVES US GRAVE CONCERN. THE OTHER ROVISION IS WE'D LIKE TO SEE AN EXPANSION OF THE WELL THE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION IS CONTAINED IN THE LAW TODAY IT'S VERY LIMITED. IN THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT THIS MEASURE IS BASED UPON A SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE THAT IS LESS THAN A YEAR AND A HALF OLD AND WE THINK IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE TO TAKE THIS MEASURE. STATEWIDE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS NICOLE RISE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AREN'T WE ALL ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE BILL. ON MANY OF THE REASONS OF FOR MANY OF THE REASONS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY STATED BUT I ALSO WANTED TO JUST -- EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THE HARDSHIP ISSUE WHICH IS CONCERNING FOR US WE WERE ON THE LOW MOAN BILL LAST YEAR I NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I THINK IT WAS. AND WE WERE ABLE TO WORK OUT -- A PROVISION RELATED TO HARDSHIP THAT HELPED US TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION THE HARDSHIP PROVISION IN THIS BILL IS RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AT A COMPANY HAS. AND THE COUNT OF EMPLOYEES REALLY ISN'T THE ISSUE ESPECIALLY FOR THE MANUFACTURING. INDUSTRY IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE FACILITY IF THE FACILITY IS SUCH THAT WE CAN'T PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE FOR MOTHER TO LACTATE OTHER THAN. A BATHROOM PLACE OR A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE THEN THAT CREATES A HARDSHIP SPECIALLY FOR OUR SMALL MANUFACTURERS SO WE WHAT LIKE THE HARDSHIP TO BE BASED ON THE FACILITY NOT ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WE THINK THAT IS A BETTER TARGET AND THAT IS TRULY WHERE. THE HARDSHIP IS GOING TO ORIGINATE FROM. FOR THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT FACILITY THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS CENTER [inaudible] ROSS. THANK YOU MISTER BLASIER. PERHAPS THE AUTHOR COULD CLARIFY FOR ME BECAUSE I I'VE SEE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT. MAYBE YOU SAID THIS AND I MISSED IT. THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE SPECIFIC BUILDING STANDARDS SPELLED OUT IN THE BILL. PLACING BUILDING CODES AND STATUTES [inaudible] AND WITH REGARD TO THE SAN FRANCISCO WORKPLACE ORDINANCE THAT'S THE STARTING. FOR PURPOSES OF DISCUSSING APPROPRIATE. THE ASSUME IN REGULATION IS THAT CORRECT. THE BILL CURRENTLY ON AMENDED OR PRETTY MOMENT -- STRIDES BUILDING CODES AND INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO STICK. BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION. TO GO THROUGH ITS PROCESS. AS IT NORMALLY DOES TO ADOPT BUILDING CODES DIRECTING THEM. TO DO THAT -- SO WE TAKE IN THE MORE TRADITIONAL ROUTE. AROUND BUILDING CODES WHICH LEGISLATURE TYPICALLY DOESN'T CRAFT BUILDING CODES TO WE DIRECT THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION -- TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE AND COME UP WITH BUILDING CODES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS DOING. WELL I'M INCLINED -- TO MOVE THE BILL OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE HARDSHIP PROVISIONS I UNDERSTAND THE MANUFACTURES CONCERNS OF NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES SOMETIMES IS AN APPROPRIATE THRESHOLD AND STANDARD SOMETIMES IT'S NOT DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE FACILITY IN THE BUSINESS INVOLVES SO I'D. I'D ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE OF A PUBLIC ABILITY OF PAGO WITH RESPECTED BY LOCATIONS -- I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY ANOTHER WAY TO GET OUT IN FORCE MEANT -- RATHER THAN -- PUT ANOTHER. NOTCH IN THE PARK PAGO BELT HERE. BY ALLOWING PAGA ENFORCEMENT OF THE LABOR CODE THIS IS MY PERSONAL VIEW SO I'D ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS WELL. BUT WE WERE THERE WE DID HAVE A SPECIFIC RIGHT RIGHT ACTION THAT WE REMOVED FROM THE BILL AND THE LABOR COMMITTEE -- AND THE PAGA -- REMEDY IS A PRETTY STANDARD. REDDING CALIFORNIA LAW IT'S NOT. SOME A NEW. OF THE CRAFTED CAUSE OF ACTION. AND INSTANCE TO YOU KNOW WE TRY TO TO WORKERS IN OTHER CONTACTS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE RATE. IS ACTUALLY A RIGHT AND IF YOU CAN ENFORCE A IT'S NOT. IT DOESN'T MEAN VERY MUCH SO BUT WE WILL -- SCRAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT WELL AND I UNDERSTAND PARK IN THE CONTEXT OF A WAGE CLAIM. IN YOUR PAYSTUB AND YOUR OVERTIME ENTITLEMENT BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TIGHTEN THE OTHER PIECES OF THIS UP THEN IF IN FACT IT BECOMES POCKET CLAIM THAT YOU CAN FORCES LIKE YOU CAN IN OVERTIME QUICK. BECAUSE THE OVERTIME RULES OF PRETTY CUT AND DRIED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXEMPTIONS AND EVEN THOSE TODAY ARE PRETTY. PRETTY SET IN STONE SO WILL THEY MAKE SURE THAT THE THIS CAN BE COMPLIED WITH BY. EMPLOYERS UP AND DOWN THE STATED FOR GOING TO ALLOW. A REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS FOR ENFORCEMENT ACROSS LET'S SAY -- AN INDUSTRY. WORK ANYWHERE THANK YOU BUT I WILL I WILL CONTINUE WE'VE -- THIS BILL -- IS -- WE HAD SHALL WE SAY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WE IT SAYS TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE TESTIMONY HER TODAY WE MADE MANY AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL LAST YEAR WHICH CONTINUE TO BE REFLECTED IN THE BILL THIS YEAR. IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- THE TWO THINGS THAT WERE REMOVED -- FROM THE BILL BEFORE WAS VETOED WHERE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND THE BUILDING CODE -- LAST YEAR -- THE NOW THE ONLY THING IN THE BILL. THAT WAS NOT IN THE VETO TO VERSION IN TERMS OF AMENDMENTS FROM LAST YEAR. IS THE BUILDING CODE PROVISION ON ON QUITE A FEW OTHER MOMENTS WAITING THAT WE NEGOTIATED LAST YEAR WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY REMAIN IN THE BILL AND SO I I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE -- THE MEMBERS UNDERSTANDS. WITH A WE WORKED INTENSIVELY WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND I'VE MADE NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS. AND RESPONSE AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDES YOU IN TERMS OF WE ARE WILLINGNESS TO WORK FOR FOLKS. ON ALL SIDES OF AN ISSUE SENATORS SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. WE SHOULD CENTER WE WILL KEEP POSITION FIND THANK YOU. ANOTHER. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MATH MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR -- I I SHARE THE SAME THE SAME CONCERNS -- I APPRECIATE HOW HOW HARD YOU WORK AT NEGOTIATING AND I EXPECT THAT. THEY WILL CONTINUE SO I JUST WANNA MINUTES PER TODAY -- I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO -- BUT THE HARDSHIP IN THE PARK I ISSUE. CAN IT'S A BACK DOOR. POCKET ISSUE GIVEN THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE -- ELIMINATED THAT I DO APPRECIATE THE THE CHANGES -- I I WANNA PUT A PIN IN THE CONTACT -- ON THAT TO SEE SOMEBODY -- ON THAT. BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION -- IN THEY ACTUALLY DON'T RIGHT. THE THE CODES THE THE IT USUALLY GOES TO A DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE WITH THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION DOES IS THEY THEY REVIEW THEM AND THEY DO THE PUBLIC PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S UPPER DOWN. SO I AM NOT. WE I THINK THE WE ME NEED TO SEND. WE MAY NEED TO SEND IT. TO SOME OTHER ENTITY BUT I'M I NEED TO THINK THROUGH THAT A LITTLE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY IDEAS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU.
