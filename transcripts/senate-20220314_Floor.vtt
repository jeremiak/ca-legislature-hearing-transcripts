THE LEGISLATURE'S LONG STANDING

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:19.551
POLICY TO EXPAND RATHER THAN

REDUCE STUDENT ACCESS TO PUBLIC

00:25:21.953 --> 00:25:23.989
IRE TO HIGHER EDUCATION. LET ME

00:25:24.055 --> 00:25:25.190

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:27.192
BILL DOES IT MODIFIES THE

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:29.027
LANGUAGE IN OUR PUBLIC RESOURCES

CODE RELATED TO LRT PEAS THAT'S

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.365
LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS BY

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.915
RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:51.349
NO I SPECIFY THAT BECAUSE THIS

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.818
IS NOT AN EXEMPTION UNDER SECRET

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:55.287
THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT IT L. R.

00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:57.422
D. P. THAT IS EXEMPTED IT IS

00:25:57.489 --> 00:25:59.557
RATHER THAT WE ARE NOT FREE OR

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:01.726
DENYING THAT STUDENT ENROLLMENT

00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:03.595
MAY IN AND OF ITSELF BE THE

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.230
HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:06.798
OVER ANY OTHER OF THE

ACTIVITIES. IN OUR PROJECTS OR

00:26:09.935 --> 00:26:11.503
POPULATIONS ENGAGED IN THE

00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:14.773

DO NOT CONSTITUTE A SEPARATE

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:26.084
PROJECT UNDER SECRET AND THAT IS

00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:27.719
IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS I

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:28.853
MENTIONED. THE LINE IN THAT

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.188
STATUTE AND THE STATUTE AS A

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.324

THE L. R. D. P. A. PROJECT UNDER

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:44.803
SECRET. SO IN THE EVENT THAT A

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:45.971
COURT FINDS THE CAMPUS'S

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:46.871
ACTIVITIES ARE IN VIOLATION OF

00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:48.073
THE CAMPUSES LONG RANGE

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:49.874

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:50.054
AND I APPRECIATED I THINK THIS

00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:53.057
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.259
URGE YOUR I'VE BUILT ON THIS

00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:58.663
BILL. SENATOR NIELSEN. BUT A

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.198
PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:02.200
OF THE SENATE I AGREE WITH THE

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:04.469
PRO TEN THIS IS THE RIGHT THING

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:07.105
TO DO. AND I WILL SUPPORT FOR

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:10.275
THE STUDENTS. BUT NOT FOR YOU

00:30:10.341 --> 00:30:13.444
SEE. HIGHER EDUCATION FOR

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:16.915
DECADES HAS OVER AND ROLLED AND

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.650
ENROLLED LARGER NUMBERS OF OUT

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:20.485
OF STATE STUDENTS FOR THE SAKE

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:24.689
OF MONEY. NOT POLICY MAKE NO

00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:27.258
MISTAKE ABOUT IT IT IS ABOUT

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:29.961
MONEY FOR THE UNIVERSITY. THAT

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:32.564
SOMETIMES THOUGH NOT ALWAYS

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.533
RESULTS IN QUALITY EDUCATION.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.735
AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR-

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:41.039
ATTENDEES I WON'T SAY OUR YOUTH

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:44.175
. BUT OUR ATTENDEES THAT IN

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:47.812
ITSELF IS GOOD. THE MODIFICATION

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:50.982
OF SICK ONE AND IT'S INTERESTING

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:53.484
TO HEAR SOME OF THE- YOU SEE

00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:55.620
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SECRET REFORM

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:56.721
NOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:59.123
THEM. MOST OF THE TIME THEY DO

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.392
NOTHING BUT OPPOSE ANY SICK

00:31:01.459 --> 00:31:04.696
PERFORM FOR OTHER. ENDEAVORS AND

00:31:04.762 --> 00:31:07.365
INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:31:07.432 --> 00:31:09.567
THAT'S MY POINT WE NEED A BROAD

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:13.171
DEEP SLEEPER REFORM NOT PICKING

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:15.807
AROUND THE EDGES AS WITH THE

00:31:15.873 --> 00:31:18.309
LEGISLATURE HAS DONE FOR SPORTS

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:21.246
STADIUMS FOR EXAMPLE. I ARGUE

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:24.115
THAT THAT THAT'S NOT A GOOD USE

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:26.317
. FOR SPORTS STADIUMS THAT HELP

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:29.020
SOMEBODY OUT MAYBE SURE TO KEEP

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:31.823
THE TEAM IN TOWN MAYBE. THAT'S

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:33.558
NOT THE BROKEN PORTENT USE. THE

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:37.996
FRONT. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:40.231
IT IS A GOOD USE BECAUSE WE'RE

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:42.100
GOING TO HAVE THOUSANDS OF

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:43.134
STUDENTS THAT WILL NOW BE ABLE

00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:44.769
TO CONTINUE TO COMPLETE THEIR

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:47.005
EDUCATION. BECAUSE OF. BECAUSE

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:48.539
OF A SHORTAGE COURT DECISION

00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:52.043
MAYBE. BUT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.279
YEARS NOT TO BE SO CRITICAL OF

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:57.615
COURT DECISIONS. MANY OF THEM I

00:31:57.682 --> 00:31:59.217
HAVE OPPOSED OVER THE DECADES

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:01.886
MMHM LOCAL LEVEL COURT DECISIONS

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:03.755
THE US SUPREME COURT DECISIONS

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:07.091
ON MANY OCCASIONS. THAT COURT

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:10.895
MADE A INDEPENDENT DECISION. THE

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:13.298
RIGHT DECISION CERTAINLY NOT FOR

00:32:13.364 --> 00:32:14.699
A LOT OF STUDENTS. NOT FOR THE

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:17.502
UNIVERSITY AS WELL. AND IN THAT

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:21.606
RESPECT I URGE A NO VOTE.

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:26.177
SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:28.513

00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:33.151
MEASURE AND I ALSO WANNA ECHO ON

00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:35.320
THE PRETENCE REMARKS AND EXPRESS

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:37.255
MY DEEP GRATITUDE- TO THE

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:39.324
SENATOR FROM BERKELEY FOR HER

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.391
EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP-

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:42.260
BECAUSE OF HER LEADERSHIP AND

00:32:42.327 --> 00:32:43.328
THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT HERE

00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:46.397
THOUSANDS OF LIVES OF YOUNG

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:48.266
PEOPLE WILL BE BETTER SO THANK

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.401
YOU- COLLEAGUES THE LAWSUIT THAT

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:53.771
LED UP TO THIS ARBITRARY- COP OF

00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:56.641
UC BERKELEY'S AND ROMAN- WILL

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:57.875
HARM THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA

00:32:57.942 --> 00:32:59.110
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMPLY

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:02.146
TRYING. TO GET AN EDUCATION AND

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:04.148
THIS EMERGENCY TRIAGE

00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:07.018
LEGISLATION WILL SOLVE THAT

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.319
IMMEDIATE PROBLEM. BUT WE ALSO

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:10.421
NEED TO ASK OURSELVES HOW WE GOT

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:13.191
HERE. HOW ON EARTH DID OUR

00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:14.659
SYSTEM OF LAW IN CALIFORNIA

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:15.993
ENABLE PEOPLE TO USE AND

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.429
ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. TO DICTATE

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:21.165
HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ALLOWED TO

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:23.768
ATTEND UC CAMPUS. THE ANSWER IS

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:26.471
THAT TRAGICALLY A CRITICALLY

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:27.038
IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:30.575
SYKORA. HAS BEEN DISTORTED BUT

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:32.744
BEYOND RECOGNITION TO EMPOWER

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.779
ANYONE WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:37.382
A LAWYER TO DELAY OR BLOCK EVEN

00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:38.616
THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.352
SUSTAINABLE PROJECTS. THE TRAIN

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:43.354
WRECK THAT WE'RE RESOLVING TODAY

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:46.124
AT BERKELEY WAS VERY HIGH

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.924
PROFILE AND MADE HEADLINES

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:49.694
EVERYWHERE. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.396
THAT WHAT HAPPENED AT BERKELEY.

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:54.332
WAS NOT EVEN REMOTELY UNIQUE.

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.533
WHAT HAPPENED AT BERKELEY

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.835
HAPPENS EVERY DAY IN THE STATE

00:33:57.902 --> 00:34:00.304
OF CALIFORNIA NOT IN WAYS TO

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:01.606
GENERATE NATIONAL HEADLINES ARE

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:03.708
LOTS OF TWITTER TRAFFIC'S. NOT

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:04.909
IN WAYS TO GET THOUSANDS OF

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:07.311
PEOPLE RILED UP BUT A MUCH

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:11.115
QUIETER SMALLER WAYS. THAT

00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:13.418
DEEPLY HARM OUR STATE. IN MANY

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:15.920
WAYS TRAGICALLY SEE WHAT IS THE

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:18.956
LAW THAT SWALLOWED CALIFORNIA.

00:34:19.023 --> 00:34:20.458
IN ADDITION THE SEQUEL BEING

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.293
USED TO ARBITRARILY CAPPED YOU

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.495
SEE IN ROMAN SEQUEL HAS BEEN

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:27.165
USED TO STOP OR DELAY BIKE LANES

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.633
IT'S BEEN USED TO STOP OR DELAY

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.234
TRAINS AND OTHER PUBLIC

00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:32.370
TRANSPORTATION. IT'S BEEN USED

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:34.705
TO STOP CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS

00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:35.973
IT'S BEEN USED TO STOP APARTMENT

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.476
BUILDINGS LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:40.678
TO A TRAIN STATION. THESE ARE

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:42.146
THINGS THAT ARE ALL GOOD FOR THE

00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:45.716
ENVIRONMENT. THESE HELP REDUCE

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:48.252
CARBON EMISSIONS AND YES SECRET

00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:50.288
TRAGICALLY HAS BEEN REGULARLY

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:52.924
USE TO STOP OR THE LADIES

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:54.792
CLIMATE FRIENDLY PROJECTS. HOW

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:57.962
COULD THAT BE AND THE ANSWER IS

00:34:58.029 --> 00:34:59.831
THAT WHEN SIEGEL WAS WRITTEN

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:02.333
FIFTY PLUS YEARS AGO. CLIMATE

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.536
CHANGE WAS NOT THE FOCUS OF OUR

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:07.638
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS. SEQUEL

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:10.808
WAS CREATED WHEN ANY AND ALL

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:11.642
DEVELOPMENT WAS CONSIDERED BAD

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:13.177
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:14.846
POPULATION GROWTH WAS CONSIDERED

00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:17.482
THE TOP ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT

00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:19.083
WHEN LIMITING GROWTH IN CITIES

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.585
LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AND BERKELEY

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:23.321
AND SANTA MONICA WAS CONSIDERED

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:26.257
PRO ENVIRONMENT. BUT WE NOW KNOW

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:27.859
THAT THAT APPROACH MAKING IT

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:29.460
HARDER IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:31.696
ANYTHING ANYWHERE NO MATTER HOW

00:35:31.762 --> 00:35:33.564
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:36.467
ACTUALLY FUELS CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:37.969
AND AS A RESULT BY ALLOWING

00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:40.271
<u>NYONE WHO CAN HIRE A LAWYER TO</u>

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:41.806
BLOCK THINGS LIKE INFILL HOUSING

00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:43.875
TRANSIT AND CLEAN ENERGY SEE

00:35:43.941 --> 00:35:46.611
WHAT TRAGICALLY IS USED AND

00:35:46.677 --> 00:35:49.046
ABUSED IN A WAY THAT HELPS FUEL

00:35:49.113 --> 00:35:51.649
CLIMATE CHANGE. WHEN C. QUEST

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:53.751
USED TO STOP DENSE URBAN INFILL

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.120
DEVELOPMENTS. THE PEOPLE WHO

00:35:56.187 --> 00:35:57.522
WOULD HAVE LIVED IN THOSE

00:35:57.588 --> 00:35:59.524
APARTMENTS THEY DON'T EVAPORATE

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.958
THEY'RE GONNA LIVE FURTHER AWAY

00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:03.060
WHERE THEY HAVE TO DRIVE MORE

00:36:03.127 --> 00:36:05.162
AND MORE CARBON EMISSIONS. ONE

00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:06.797
SEQUEL IS USED TO STOP

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:07.665
SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:11.035
PROJECTS PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:12.970
TO DRIVE MORE. WHEN C. WAS USED

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:15.172
TO BLOCK STUDENTS FROM ENROLLING

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:16.874
AT UC BERKELEY A PLACE WHERE

00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:18.276
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE VERY

00:36:18.342 --> 00:36:20.912
MUCH. THEY'RE JUST GOING TO GO

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:21.546
SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY HAVE

00:36:21.612 --> 00:36:23.781
TO DRIVE MORE THAN CARBON

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:25.283
EMISSIONS GO UP. I WANT TO BE

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:27.051
CLEAR SEQUEL IS A CRITICALLY

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:29.720
IMPORTANT LAW I DO NOT AGREE

00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:31.088
WITH THOSE WHO SAY THAT IT

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:32.557
SHOULD BE ELIMINATED OR REPEALED

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:34.825
THAT WOULD BE A BAD. IDEA SEQUEL

00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:37.161
HAS DONE MANY GOOD THINGS IN

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:38.763
TERMS OF SLOWING DOWN OR%

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:40.398
STOPPING PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:41.432
ACTUALLY BAD FOR THE

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:43.601
ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT NEEDS TO

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:46.170
CONTINUE. BUT I DO AGREE THAT

00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:48.439
SICK ONE NEEDS TO BE MODERNIZED

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:51.509
SO THAT IT IS INTENSELY FOCUSED.

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:54.378
ON CLIMATE ACTION. THAT IS WHY

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:56.180
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION IS ABOUT

00:36:56.247 --> 00:36:58.182
TODAY. AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED

00:36:58.249 --> 00:37:01.352
TO SEE WHAT TO BE A TOOL TO

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:02.920
ACHIEVE. SO LET'S PASS THIS

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:05.222
MEASURE TODAY LET'S LET THE

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:07.525
STUDENTS GET AN EDUCATION. BUT

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:09.527
LET'S NOT THINK FOR A MINUTE

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:11.329
THAT THIS MESS WAS SOMEHOW AN

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:14.432
ANOMALY. WHEN IT COMES TO SEE

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:15.900
WHAT THIS UC BERKELEY TRAIN

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:19.337
WRECK ISN'T A BUG. IT'S A

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:22.473
FEATURE I ASKED FOR AN AIBO.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:33.884
SYNERGY. ONE AT MEMBERS TODAY I

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:36.020
RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:37.488
EIGHTEEN AS SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:38.389
VERY CLOSELY WITH THE US

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:39.657
STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:41.225
SYSTEM AND STUDENTS APPLYING TO

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:42.760
THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM I KNOW

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.528
WHAT AN ADMISSIONS DECISION

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:47.465
MEANS TO MANY I KNOW WHAT IT'S

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:48.265
LIKE TO COMPLETE AN ONLINE

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:50.434
APPLICATION I KNOW WHAT IT'S

00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:52.570
LIKE TO WRITE A COLLEGE ESSAY

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:54.872
I'VE EDITED HUNDREDS IN MY LIFE

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:56.007
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO

00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:57.708
THROUGH THE FINANCIAL AID

00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:59.276
PROCESS WITH THE DREAM AND HOPE

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:01.412
OF GOING TO HIRE AND- I BELIEVE

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.781
THAT THE STUDENTS TODAY NOT JUST

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:04.749
FOR UC BERKELEY BUT STUDENTS

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:07.585
ACROSS ALL THREE OF OUR SYSTEMS

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:08.319
UC CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:11.956
SYSTEMS. WILL BENEFIT FROM OUR

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:14.291
APPROACH. BUT ALTHOUGH I RISE IN

00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:16.193
SUPPORT OF TODAY'S BILL I DO

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.230
WANT TO INSURE THAT WE CONTINUE

00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:21.599
TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. IF THE

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.401
UNIVERSITIES DON'T HAVE TO GO

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:25.603
THROUGH SEA QUEST FOR INCREASED

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.570
ENROLLMENT THERE HAVE GOT TO BE

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.506
ALTERNATIVES TO ENSURE THAT

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:30.708
STUDENT HOUSING IS ADDRESSED. I

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:33.177
WORK WITH TOO MANY STUDENTS WHO

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:35.312
ARE LIVING IN CARS WHO ARE COUCH

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:38.349
SURFING WHO ARE LIVING IN HOTELS

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.184
NOT JUST ON MY UNIVERSITY CAMPUS

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:42.119
BUT ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN MANY

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:44.989
OF OUR DISTRICTS. AND THERE IS

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.157
JUST SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH STUDENT

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:48.359
HOUSING. THIS IMPACTS THEIR

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:49.994
ACADEMICS IT IMPACTS OUR OVERALL

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:52.029
WELL BEING AND IT IMPACTS THE

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:54.065
COMMUNITY AT LARGE. THE STUDENT

00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:57.201
HOUSING CRISIS HAS AN IMPACT ON

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:59.537
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. WE

00:38:59.603 --> 00:39:02.006
MUST ENSURE THAT STUDENT HOUSING

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.041
IS ADEQUATE THAT IT'S HEALTHY

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:06.544
AND THAT IT'S SAFE. THE UC'S

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.112
MUST ADDRESS THE ENROLLMENT

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:12.416
ISSUE. NEW LEGISLATION TODAY WE

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:14.819
DON'T WANT TO DISREGARD THE

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:17.421
ESTABLISHED PROCESS WE KNOW THAT

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:19.390
OUR UNIVERSITIES NEW BUT

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:21.358
GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS WE

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:23.527
ALSO HAVE UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:26.497
A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS

00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:27.732
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP

00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:29.967
UP WITH THEM. AND WILE WE TRIED

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:30.501
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:33.404
STUDENTS WE ALSO CANNOT LEAVE

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:35.306
OUR COMMUNITIES BEHIND AND WE

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:38.375
CANNOT. LEAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY

00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:40.611
TO JUST THE LEGISLATURE. OUR

00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:43.114
SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION MUST

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.915
BE PARTNERS IN SHARING THIS

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:48.352
RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU SIS

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:50.521
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALSO NEED

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:52.323
TO FIND A WAY TO WORK MORE

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:54.692
CLOSELY TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:56.794
SITUATION. NOT JUST THE

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:58.429
SITUATION IN FRONT OF US BUT THE

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.030
ONGOING ISSUES THAT ENROLLMENT

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:01.732
WILL BRING TO OUR LOCAL

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:03.701
COMMUNITIES TO OUR CITIES TO OUR

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:06.070
COUNTIES TO ALL OF OUR NATURAL

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:08.839
RESOURCES. AND I VOTED TODAY

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:10.808
DOES NOT NEGATE OUR

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:12.376
RESPONSIBILITY THE

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:13.978
RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:15.980
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:16.981
AND OUR COMMUNITY'S

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:19.216
RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP WORKING

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:22.686
ON THIS ISSUE TO FIND SOLUTIONS.

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:25.356
SOLUTIONS THAT WILL IMPACT OUR

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:27.024
UNIVERSITIES WITH INCREASED

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.960
ENROLLMENT. WITH THAT MEMBERS I

00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:32.229
DO HOPE THAT WE SUPPORT THIS BUT

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:33.397
I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:34.231
WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.933
ONGOING ISSUES THAT WILL BE

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.235
PRESENTED TO OUR LOCAL

00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:40.171
COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. VETR

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:45.009
LOWERED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

I'M NOT- LET ME SAY FIRST IT

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:49.814
ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE THE

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.516
BUDGET CHAIR AND EVERYONE ELSE

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:53.984
THAT WORKED ON THIS GETS

00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:56.220
TREMENDOUS CREDIT BECAUSE THERE

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.889
WAS A VERY UNIQUE CALL OUT IN

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:01.759
THE LAW HAD CITED ENROLLMENT AND

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.727
TURNED IT INTO A PROJECT THAT

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:06.063
SHOULD NEVER BE THAT WAS AN OVER

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.032
REACH THE STUDENTS THAT WERE

00:41:08.098 --> 00:41:10.000
POTENTIALLY DENIED SHOULD NOT BE

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:12.837
DENIED THIS FIXES IT AND I'M

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:16.473
GOING TO BE PROUD TO VOTE FOR

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.375
IT- IN A MINUTE. I THINK THERE'S

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:20.544
A NUANCE HERE BECAUSE MANY OF

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:21.946
THE SPEECHES HAVE BEEN GIVEN

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:25.516
COMPLETELY. ABOUT SEQUEL. AND

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:30.521
YET IF- AND I KNOW I SAID THIS

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:31.655
IN THE BUDGET HEARING THIS

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:34.358
MORNING. HI I WAS ONCE MAYOR OF

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:37.695
A TOWN THAT HOSTS A UNIVERSITY

00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:40.764
THAT IS A CITY OF TWENTY FIVE

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:43.234
THOUSAND INSIDE OF SIXTY

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.269
THOUSAND PERSON CITY. THEN THERE

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:47.204
IS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:50.374
CONSTITUTIONAL EXEMPTION FROM

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:52.476
ANY LOCAL LAND USE ANY LOCAL

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:54.678
TAXES AND FEES ANY LOCAL

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:57.715
RESIDENTS OF REGULATION OF ANY

00:41:57.781 --> 00:42:00.284
KIND. SO WHEN EXAMPLES OF TRAIN

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:02.620
HOUSING BALL PARKS ARE ARE

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:05.055
RAISED THOSE ALL HAVE PROCESSES

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.724
THEY GO THROUGH THE NORMAL ORDER

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.826
OF THINGS NONE OF THEM HAVE A

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:11.195
CONSTITUTIONAL EXEMPTION FROM

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:14.798
LAND USE REVIEW. YOU SEE DOGS

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:18.002
AND SO IF YOU. ARE THE SENATOR

00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:19.336
FROM SANTA BARBARA THE JUST

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:20.971
SPOKE THERE WAS A HUGE DORM WITH

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:23.741
NO WINDOWS ON A COASTAL BLUFF.

00:42:23.807 --> 00:42:26.543
THAT DESERVES TO GO THROUGH SOME

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:29.613
FORM OF LAND USE IT IN SANTA

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.750
CRUZ WE ARE NOW IN A HIGH FIRE

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:34.151
SO THE ENTIRE CAMPUS WAS

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:37.021
EVACUATED IN THE CZ YOU FIRE THE

00:42:37.087 --> 00:42:38.956
FIRE THAT TOOK NINE HUNDRED AND

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:40.391
TWENTY FIVE HOUSES MADE IT TO

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:43.327
THE UPPER REACHES. OF THE CAMPUS

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:45.996
THIS IS TRUE ACROSS THE STATE

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:49.700
THAT IS WHY THE ISSUE OF UC IS

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:52.436
DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF THEM.

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:56.006
AND THE NEEDLE WAS THREADED HERE

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:57.741
THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

00:42:57.808 --> 00:43:01.378
STILL ARE SUBJECT TO SPEAKER AND

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:02.713
THAT IS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.114
HAVING THEM SUBJECT TO NO LAND

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:05.950
USE REGULATION OF ANY KIND WOULD

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:08.118
BE A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:10.354
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:12.189
DOING. AND I AM HOPING THAT

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.258
EVERYONE THAT IS SO STRONGLY

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:17.027
BEHIND THIS JOINS US IN DOING

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:19.196
THE STEPS WE HAVE TO DO. WE

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:21.198
APPROPRIATED TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:22.700
FOR HOUSING AT HIGHER EDUCATION

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:24.568
LAST YEAR SIX HUNDRED MILLION

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:25.436
GOES TO THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.404
CALIFORNIA. IT WAS DESIGNED TO

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:29.006
BE OVER MULTIPLE YEARS IT IS

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:31.809
ALREADY OVERSUBSCRIBED. WE HAVE

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:34.178
TO DO MORE. LAST YEAR WE DID A

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:36.146
CAP BUT THE THREE CAMPUSES THAT

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:37.915
HAVE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF OUT

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.950
OF STATE STUDENTS. SO PEOPLE

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:41.251
THAT HAVE BEEN PAYING TAXES IN

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:42.953
THE STATE. CAN MAKE SURE THAT

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.488
THEIR KIDS CAN GET INTO A

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:47.157
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUS.

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:48.692
AND IN OUR BUDGET HEARING THIS

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:49.526
YEAR THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:51.662
CALIFORNIA BEFORE WE EVEN KNEW

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:53.797
THIS LAWSUIT WAS OUT THERE. WE

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:55.299
BASICALLY SAID TO THE UNIVERSITY

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:57.701
OF CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN'T JUST BE

00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:59.503
JAMMING MORE STUDENTS ON EVERY

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.405
CAMPUS YOU HAVE TO HAVE PLANS

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.574
FOR ADDITIONAL CAMPUSES. FOR

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.709
CENTERS FOR WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:07.711
APPROPRIATELY TAKE THE GROWTH

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:09.913
THAT WE WANT AND WE NEED AND ONE

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.849
OF THE FINEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:14.385
SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. SO I JUST

00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:16.420
HOPE. THAT THERE'S JUST A

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.389
RECOGNITION THAT THE UNIVERSITY

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:19.990
OF CALIFORNIA IS A UNIQUE

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:23.961
SITUATION. AND HAVING SAID THAT-

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.496
THIS NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND

00:44:25.562 --> 00:44:27.631
WALMART CALLED OUT AS A PROJECT

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:29.700
AND I HOPE EVERYBODY SUPPORTS

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:33.037
THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR THE

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.104
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY. SENATOR

00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:39.977
WRESTLE. THANK YOU MAN PRESENT I

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:42.046
THINK SOME COMMENTS ARE MADE

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:43.614
THAT ARE ARE EXCELLENT I JUST

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.883
WANTED TO BRIEFLY OUT ON TO THEM

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:47.451
BECAUSE I THINK THIS BILL IS

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.752
VERY IMPORTANT IN ADDRESSING A

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:52.289
PART PROBLEM THAT- MAKE IT WORSE

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:55.559
AND UNFORTUNATELY- OF THEIR

00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:57.594
ACTIONS BEING TAKEN TO COUNTER

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:58.996
THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:00.964
UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE SECOND TO

00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:03.500
NONE IN THE NATION. AND I THINK

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:06.870
HAVE LED TO HELP CREATE SOME OF

00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:07.938
THE WEALTHIEST NEIGHBORHOODS IN

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:09.973
OUR STATE I MEAN ARE YOU KNOW IF

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.542
YOU LOOK AT WHERE OUR

00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:12.142
UNIVERSITIES ARE LOCATED THEY

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:14.578
TEND TO BE LOCATED IN WEALTHY

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:16.580
NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHEN THEY WERE

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:17.347
FIRST SIGHTED THEY WEREN'T

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:19.616
WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHAT

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:22.319
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WHY ARE OUR

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:24.188
OUR UNIVERSITIES LOCATION

00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:26.657
CONTRIBUTING TO MORE INVESTMENT

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:27.658
IN THOSE AREAS AND BETTER

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:30.461
HOUSING I WENT TO UCLA. I KNOW

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:32.262
IT'S A HARD THING FOR ME TO FIND

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:35.199
OFF CAMPUS HOUSING BECAUSE I WAS

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:36.667
SURROUNDED BY OUR UNIVERSITY

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:38.368
TRYING TO BUY A BELLAIRE AND

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:41.805
WEST LA AND BEVERLY HILLS SO

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:44.108
WHERE STUDENTS CAN LIVE I HAD TO

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:47.578
LIVE IN A VAN OFF CAMPUS- RIDING

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:49.146
MY BIKE TO WORK BECAUSE I

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:51.148
COULDN'T EVEN PARK MY VAN CLOSE

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:54.184
TO THE CAMPUS BECAUSE OF PERMIT

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:55.886
PARKING. PENCIL AND RIGHT NOW

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:59.189
OUTSIDE OF UCLA. ONE OF THE-

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.859
MOST EXPENSIVE HOMES IN ALL OF

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.227
THE UNITED STATES IS CURRENTLY

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:05.562
LISTED FOR SALE. SO WHEN YOU

00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:07.097
WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT THESE

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:09.433
UNIVERSITIES TO FURTHER

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.067
SURROUNDING AREAS THEY TEND TO

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:13.370
HAVE. LOTS OF VEHICLES WITH

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:14.905
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SO NO

00:46:14.972 --> 00:46:17.875
EMISSIONS LIKE I KNOW UCSD UCLA

00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:19.610
ARE DOING I KNOW. BERKELEY HAS

00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:21.445
SIMILAR PROGRAMS ALL OUR

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:23.881
UNIVERSITIES ARE LEADERS IN

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:26.750
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. IN OUR ARE

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:29.086
REDUCING THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT.

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:30.487
ARE PROVIDING STUDENT

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:32.289
TRANSPORTATION ON SITE IN OUR

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:35.626
CAMPUSES BUT LET'S FACE IT. ON

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:37.261
OUR CAMPUSES WHERE STUDENTS MOST

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:39.696
LIKELY TO DO WALK. OR RIDE A

00:46:39.763 --> 00:46:41.999
BICYCLE. CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:43.867
VARMINT OLYMPIC. I THINK SEQUEL

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:46.670
IS BEING ABUSED. I THINK WE

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:48.572
SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO CURB THIS

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.407
WITH REGARD TO OUR UNIVERSITIES.

00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:52.843
UCSD A LAWSUIT BLOCKED THE

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.912
CREATION OF A HILLEL HOUSE. THAT

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:57.848
ACTUALLY HAD ENVIRONMENTAL THAT

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.149
PRETTY MUCH LIMITED OR

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:00.484
ELIMINATED THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:02.686
IMPACTS. AND THE PEOPLE SUING

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:04.087
DIDN'T LIVE ON PROPERTIES THAT

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:06.223
DID THE SAME THING. HOW WAS THAT

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:08.792
EVEN SURE. THEY BLOCKED THE

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:10.861
INTRODUCTION OF A OF A TROLLEY

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:12.796
LINE THAT WOULD'VE BROUGHT OF

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:15.132
YOU KNOW. ALLOWED STUDENTS TO

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:16.633
COME IN WITHOUT HAVING TO DRIVE

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.135
INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.536
ALLOW THE- THEY BLOCKED THE

00:47:19.603 --> 00:47:21.405
CREATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:24.141
FOR STUDENTS. THIS IS JUST AN

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:27.344
ABUSE OF THE LAW. BUT WHAT IS IT

00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:28.512
THE EFFECT IT CAN HAVE AN

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:31.682
ARGUMENT OR OR UNIVERSITIES. TO

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.750
REDUCING THE COMPETITIVENESS

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:36.186
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT POPULATION IN

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.621
UNIVERSITY IT DOESN'T

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:39.823
NECESSARILY TRANSLATE TO A

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.125
REDUCTION. IN QUALITY OF

00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:44.695
EDUCATION UCLA IS THE MOST

00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:46.797
POPULATED UNIVERSITY IN

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:49.967
CALIFORNIA AND IT IS THE NUMBER

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:50.567
ONE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:55.572
NATION WITH THE HIGHEST. AMOUNT

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:56.206
OF RESEARCH DOLLARS. BEING IN.

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.841
IN ALL OF THE UNIVERSITIES OF

00:47:57.908 --> 00:48:00.244
CALIPHS. SO I THINK THERE'S AN

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.946
ARGUMENT THAT THESE UNIVERSITIES

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:04.348
HAVE A BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON

00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:05.182
NEIGHBORHOODS INCLUDING

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:07.918
PROVIDING FACILITIES AND ACCESS

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:10.654
TO SERVICES AND OFTEN- A TOP

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:14.224
RATE OF CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.292
SERVICES TO THE NAME NEIGHBORING

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:18.195
MEMBERS. BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:20.831
THE- AN AMAZING JOB ENGINE AND A

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:23.700
SOURCE OF NEW INNOVATIVE IDEAS

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:25.702
FOR CALIFORNIA AND I THINK IT'S

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:27.204
TIME- WE DID SOMETHING ABOUT

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:29.239
THIS I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:30.941
THE HARD WORK MY COLLEAGUES IN

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:32.476
BUDGET AND- THE CENTER FOR

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:34.311
BERKELEY WHO HAS TAKEN THE SONG

00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:36.446
AND I HOPE THIS. WILL APPLY

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:38.015
EQUALLY TO ALL OUR UNIVERSITIES

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.549
AND WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:42.819
LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BUILD HOUSING

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:44.354
MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.189
BECAUSE CURRENTLY IF YOU'RE A

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:49.059
STUDENT ONE OF OUR UNIVERSITIES

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:50.460
OFTEN TIME. OFF ON CAMPUS

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:52.529
HOUSING IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:55.065
OFF CAMPUS HOUSING AND WE NEED

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:56.967
TO CORRECT THAT AS WELL THANK

00:48:57.034 --> 00:48:58.969
YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:02.239
DEBATE. SINGMAN CENTERS SCANNER

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:04.508
YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU SO

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:06.543
MUCH SIR MADAM PRESIDENT- THE

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:10.147
RISK OF- CHEATING MYSELF- I

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:12.449
THINK SOME SUN MAYBE ONLY A FEW

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:14.418
OF US WILL REMEMBER THEIR

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:16.653
CARTOON POGO WHERE THE LINE WAS

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.789
WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY AND IT IS

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:20.123
US AND I THINK IN MUCH OF WHAT

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.892
WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE WE COULD

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:23.493
LOOK AT THE FACT THAT FOR

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.629
EXAMPLE. I ATTENDED UC BERKELEY

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:27.898
SOME FORTY FIVE OR SO YEARS AGO

00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:29.132
AND AT THE TIME THE POPULATION

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:31.902
IN CALIFORNIA WAS HALF OR EVEN

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:34.204
LESS THAN HALF OF IT IS TODAY

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:38.408
SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE ONLY ADDED

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:41.845
ONE UC CAMPUS SO WE HAVE DOUBLED

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:43.847
. OUR POPULATION THE STATE ONE

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:45.782
CAMPUS YET OUR MASTER PLAN A

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:47.484
PIRATE SAYS THAT WE WILL

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:49.553
PROVIDE. THE SUPPORT FOR ALL

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:51.788
QUALIFIED STUDENTS. NOW WE'VE

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:53.957
ADDED A FEW MORE SEE ISSUES BUT

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:56.293
AGAIN WE LOOK AT OUR POPULATION

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.161
WE'VE NOT ADDED THAT MANY. AND

00:49:58.228 --> 00:50:00.330
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SITUATION OF

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:02.399
PERHAPS THE UNIVERSITY'S.

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:04.034
INCREASING THEIR ENROLLMENT OF

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:05.802
STUDENTS TO PAY MORE STUDENTS

00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:07.537
WHO ARE OUT OF STATE. WHEN YOU

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:10.340
LOOK AT OUR- THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:50:10.407 --> 00:50:13.577
FUNDING. OF OUR CAMPUSES AND YOU

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:15.278
GO BACK OVER A TEN TWENTY YEAR

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:17.114
PERIOD UNTIL THE LAST FOUR

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.083
YEARS. THE PROPORTION THAT THEY

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.419
RECEIVED FROM THE STATE AS

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:24.554
COMPARED TO. EITHER OF THEIR

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:26.490
TUITION OR ARE THERE OTHER ALL

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:28.392
KINDS OF OTHER EXTERNAL SOURCES

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:30.227
WHICH GREATLY OUT OF PROPORTION

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:32.996
SO IN OTHER WORDS WE USED TO

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:36.299
FIND. OUR UC SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:39.236
MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE. AND THUS

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:41.071
WE MORALLY HAD MUCH MORE OF A

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:43.306
RIGHT TO LIMIT HOW MANY OUT OF

00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:45.208
STATE STUDENTS NOW WE ARE DOING

00:50:45.275 --> 00:50:48.011
SO BY BACK FILLING THOSE- THAT

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:49.846
FUNDING SO WE ARE DOING THAT.

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:51.014
AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:54.050
HOUSING CRISIS. OBVIOUSLY OUR

00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:55.952
CAMPUSES WHETHER CSU'S COMMITTEE

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:58.955
COLLEGES OR YOU SEASON WE KNOW

00:50:59.022 --> 00:51:00.557
THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS IN ALL

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:01.892
THREE SEGMENTS WERE LIVING IN

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:03.927
CARS NOW WERE WITHOUT SHELTER.

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:05.162
NONE OF OUR SEGMENTS HAVE

00:51:05.228 --> 00:51:06.963
PROVIDED ENOUGH HOUSING NINE BUT

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.632
AT THE SAME TIME NONE OF OUR

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:11.067
COMMUNITIES HAVE EITHER. AND IF

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:13.603
WE LOOK AT MY PARTICULAR. TOWN

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.439
AND I STAYED IN BERKELEY AFTER

00:51:15.505 --> 00:51:16.840
GRADUATING FROM UC INVALID THERE

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:20.544
EVER SINCE MY OWN TOWN. PASSED A

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.212
VOTER INITIATIVE THAT PREVENTED

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:23.814
THE BUILDING OF ANY MULTI FAMILY

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.383
HOUSING FOR DECADES THEY PASS

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.218
THAT IN MY SECOND YEAR AT CAL.

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:31.388
SO NOT ONLY SO WE CAN SAY YES

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:32.856
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA- C. H. U.

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:35.625
R. C. C. C. YOU BETTER BUILD ON

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.194
MORE HOUSING HOWEVER WE HAVE TO

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.429
TELL THE COMMUNITIES ALSO.

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:40.096
BECAUSE THE HOUSING. ALL OF OUR

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:42.132
MAKE. IT SHOULD NOT BE ON THE

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:45.202
BACKS OF STUDENTS ALONE SO SP

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:46.403
ONE EIGHTEEN DOES NOT FIX ALL

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.105
THOSE PROBLEMS BY ANY MEANS NOR

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:52.108
DOES IT ELIMINATE THE POPULATION

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:53.343
AND OF COURSE STUDENTS ARE PART

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.245
OF A CAMPUS POPULATION SO THEY

00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:57.214
WILL STILL HAVE TO BE EVALUATED

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.982
AS EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF THE

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.183
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.552
CAMPUS WHICH IS WHAT S. B. EIGHT

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.187
ONE EIGHTEEN. IS TRYING TO

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:05.989
ACHIEVE NOT ONLY CHIEF I GET

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:07.991
THAT RIGHT BALANCE THAT ALL OF

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:09.226
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:12.062
NOT A PARTICULAR WAY SO WITH

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:14.898
THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON SB

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.500

TO BE USED FOR ITS ORIGINAL

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:39.175

00:54:49.452 --> 00:54:51.287
IT MAKES OTHER TECHNICAL IN

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:53.623
CLARIFYING CHANGES THE BILL IS

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.659
PRIMARILY TECHNICAL IN NATURE

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:59.462
AND DOES NOT RESULT IN NEW COSTS

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:00.130
WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:02.832
IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:04.000
DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR

00:55:04.067 --> 00:55:06.069
NELSON. SENATE PRESIDENT LATER

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:08.972
GENTLENESS AND URGE A NO VOTE ON

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:13.043
THIS. AGAIN IT'S NECESSARY FOR

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:15.478
THE BUDGET I SUPPOSE. BUT IT'S

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:19.049
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE EXCESSES

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:23.286
. OF THIS LEGISLATION. WE ARE.

00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:26.056
AUTHORIZING PROJECTS IN PAST

00:55:26.122 --> 00:55:28.224
BUDGET TO BE PAID FOR IN FUTURE

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:31.795
BUDGETS. AMONG OTHER THINGS

00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:34.964
THAT'S GETTING TO BE A HABIT NOW

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:36.966
. AND I THINK IT'S A DECEPTIVE

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:39.703
HABIT NOT GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:41.471
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT ALSO

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:43.673
PROVIDES MONEY TO DO SOMETHING

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.475
THAT MANY OF US OPPOSED.

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:49.579
DECERTIFICATION THE POLICE AND

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:51.748
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. THAT

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:55.251
WAS PASSED NOW WE'RE GONNA PAY

00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:57.454
THE PRICE. THE PART OF THE

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.657
PRICES. COMPROMISED OF LAW

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:04.561
ENFORCEMENT. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA

00:56:04.627 --> 00:56:08.565
FIND IN THIS LEGISLATION. IT

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:10.300
CIRCUMVENTS OUR NORMAL

00:56:10.366 --> 00:56:12.335
PROCEDURES WHICH AGAIN THE

00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:14.537
LEGISLATURE IS GET IN THE HABIT

00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:17.273
OF DOING WHERE WE HAVE. AT LEAST

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.409
TWO POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS.

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:21.644
TWO FISCAL COMMITTEE HEARINGS.

00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:23.713
AND NOW WE'VE BECOME USED TO

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.850
FAST TRACKING THINGS I DON'T

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.017
THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:29.352
OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:30.920
THEY LIKE IT IF THEY KNEW ABOUT

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:33.056
IT AND THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:34.457
BECAUSE THE PRESS DOESN'T EVEN

00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:36.192
MAKE AN ISSUE OF IT ANYMORE.

00:56:36.259 --> 00:56:37.827
BLOCK NO BIG DEAL. SO MANY

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:39.763
THINGS HAVE. HAPPENED ARE

00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:42.699
HAPPENING HERE. THAT CUT OUT.

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:45.902
THE PUBLIC THE DIVORCE CITIZEN

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:49.672

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.441
DESERVE LEGISLATORS ON THEIR

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:55.345
BEHALF. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS HOW

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:56.946
WE DEAL WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:59.616
HEARINGS NOW. PUBLIC COMMENT

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:01.351
USED TO TRULY BE PUBLIC COMMENT

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:03.153
PEOPLE COULD COME AND COMMENT

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:05.155
AND SAY WHAT THEY WANTED TO SAY

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:07.390
. NOW WE'VE LIMITED THAT EVEN IN

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:10.193
FLOOR DEBATE. TO THE MEMBERS

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.895

ONE OTHER ORDERS TO ALL TO

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:17.367
POSSIBLY. THAT EVERYBODY ELSE

00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:19.869
ALL THEY GET TO DO IS SAY I'M

00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:21.404

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:22.672

FOR TEN AGAINST. THAT'S ALL

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:35.451
THAT'S WORTH BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:36.586
GETTING ANY MEANINGFUL PUBLIC

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:40.256
