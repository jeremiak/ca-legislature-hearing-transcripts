00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.563
LOT OF GROUND. SO THE FIRST- IN

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:53.031
THOSE FOUR AREAS THE FIRST ONE

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.365

DECADES AND I'M KIND OF

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:02.807
FOCUSING IN. ON THE LAST DECADE

00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:05.110

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:06.978
AREA IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HOW

THE STATE BUDGET ONE OF THE

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.752
FUNCTIONS OF THOSE FUNDS- AND

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:16.154
HOW CAN WE THINK OF OUR

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:17.722
CATEGORIES OF STATE SPENDING.

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:19.791
THE FOURTH AREA WILL BE ABOUT

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.526
STATE OPERATIONS IN PARTICULAR

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.328
AND THIS IS THE COSTS THAT ARE

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:25.330
INCURRED BY THE STATE. IN ORDER

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:26.998
TO RUN SERVICES TO RICHER

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:28.566
PROVIDE SERVICES OR TO RUN

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:30.368
PROGRAMS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:31.636
VERY BRIEFLY. AND THEN THE

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:33.071
FOURTH AREA WILL BE ABOUT

00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:34.806
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN

PARTICULAR. AND IN THE

00:29:35.673 --> 00:29:37.075
ADMINISTRATIVE AREA I'LL TALK

ABOUT HEAD QUARTER COSTS AND

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:40.078
STATEWIDE GENERAL

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND FEES

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:43.848
ARE. A VERY SMALL SUBSET OF

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:47.519
WHAT WE THINK OF AS STATE.

00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:49.120
OPERATIONS COSTS. SO STARTING

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:49.854
WITH THE FOR PAGE. THIS IS

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:53.057
SHOWING ESSENTIALLY. THE STATE

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.893
BUDGET HAS COMPAREDTO THE

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:57.295
STATE ECONOMY. OVER TIME SINCE

00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:58.897
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AS YOU CAN

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:00.598
SEE FROM THE CHART AND

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:01.533
ESSENTIALLY T'S IT AS A SHARE

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:03.701
SO- IT FOR IN THE NINETEEN

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:05.036
FIFTIES THE STATE OF. THE STATE

00:30:05.103 --> 00:30:06.571
BUDGET WAS ABOUT 4% OF THE

00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:07.939
OVERALL STATE ECONOMY AND I'M

00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:09.274
NOT ROSE OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.909
DECADES UNTIL THE LATE NINETEEN

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:11.943
SEVENTIES. TO BE ABOUT EIGHT

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.945
PERCENT. BUT SINCE THE EARLY

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:14.612
NINETEEN EIGHTIES TE STATE

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:15.713
BUDGET AS A SHARE OF THE

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.148
ECONOMY HAS REALLY REMAINED

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:19.150
FLAT IT'S OCELLATED. ABOUT

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:20.752
BETWEEN 7% AND EIGHT PERCENT.

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:22.921
IT TENDS TO RISE IN TIMES OF

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:24.455
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THEN FALL A

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:26.791
BIT IN TIMES OF RECESSION- BUT

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:28.026
REALLY WHAT YOU CAN TAKE FROM

00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:29.661
THIS GRAPHIC IS THAT THE STATE

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:31.296
ECONOMY. AND THE STATE BUDGET

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:33.064
HAVE GROWN BASICALLY AT THE

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.599
SAME PACE ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.701
SAME PACE ON AVERAGE. OVER THE

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.703
LAST DECADE IN PARTICULAR ANY

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:39.837
BEEN OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES.

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.339
I'M NOT RATE OVER THE LAST

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:44.242
DECADE HAS BEEN ABOUT FIVE AND

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:45.510
A HALF PERCENT. SO TURNING THE

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.478
NEXT. THAT FIVE IN HALF PERCENT

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:48.947
IS AN AVERAGEACROSS ALL OF

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:50.281
STATE PROGRAMS. BUT THE POINT

00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:51.883
OF THIS GRAPHIC IS TO SHOW HOW

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.284
ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.753
HAS REALLY VARIED BY PROGRAM

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.387
BECAUSE THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:57.989
VARIATION. SO THE COMPLICATED

00:30:58.056 --> 00:30:59.324
GRAPHIC ON A WALK THROUGH IT

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.025
SOMEWHAT SLOWLY. EACH OF THE

00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:03.628
BUBBLES IN THIS GRAPHIC ARE

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:04.295
SHOWING YOU A DIFFERENT PROGRAM.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:05.930
THE LARGEST ONE IS FOR K.

00:31:05.997 --> 00:31:07.599
TWELVE EDUCATION. THE NEXT ONE

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:08.666
IS FOR MEDIC CAL THE STATE'S

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:12.036
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:12.837
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. AND

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:16.274
THEIR ORGANS FROM TO. THOSE BY.

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.176
BROUGHT AND- PER. ON AND NATURI.

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:19.577
AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:22.914
CRIMINAL JUSTICE ETCETERA. FROM

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:24.015
RIGHT TO LEFT THE GRAPHIC IS

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:25.583
SHOWING YOU HOW QUICKLY OR HOW

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.819
SLOWLY. THAT PROGRAM HAS GROWN

00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:30.321
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS FROM

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:31.823
TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE. TO TWENTY

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:33.124
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ALL NOTED

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:34.592
SINCE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:35.660
WAS SORT OF AN UNUSUAL BUDGET

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.095
YEAR THAT THOSE NUMBERS WOULD

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:38.529
LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT IF YOU

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:40.531
TEXT SAVE. NINETEEN TWENTY OR

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:41.065
IF YOU PICKED A DIFFERENT

00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:42.467
ENDPOINTS. AND SIMILARLY THEY

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:43.668
WOULD LOOK DIFFERENT IF YOU

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:46.504
PENSION EARLIER YEAR- SINCE

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:47.138
TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE A SORT OF

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:48.906
AT THE END OF. THE LAST YOU

00:31:48.973 --> 00:31:49.907
KNOW AS THE STATE WAS SORT OF

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:50.708
PULLING OUT OF THE GREAT

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:51.909
RECESSION AND THE BUDGET WAS

00:31:51.976 --> 00:31:53.578
CHANGING AT THAT TIME. BUT

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:55.079
HONESTLY WITH ONE OF THESE

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:56.814
GRAPHICS THE- NO MATTER WHAT

00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:58.316

WHERE YOU. YOU KNOW KIND OF

00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:01.352
START AND END IS GONNA AFFECT.

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:03.154
WHERE THE BUBBLES ARE BUT THE

00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:04.489
GENERAL TRENDS WILL ALWAYS YOU

00:32:04.555 --> 00:32:09.160
KNOW WHERE IT WILL. GENERALLY

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:09.994
BE ABOUT STUDY. SO AS YOU CAN

00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:11.829
SEE. I DO. RELATED HAVE GROWN.

PARTICULAR K. TWELVE EDUCATION

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:17.735
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE A BIT

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:19.604
BELOW OR RIGHT AROUND THE FIVE

00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:20.905

CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL AND

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:24.442
THE CALIFORNIA STATE

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:25.943
UNIVERSITY. A GROWING A BIT

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.278
FASTER THAN AVERAGE. JUSTICE

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:30.081
PROGRAMS CONVERSELY ON AVERAGE

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:32.383
HAVE GROWN LESS THAN. THAT

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.885
AVERAGE FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT

00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:34.986
CLOSER TO THREE TO FOUR

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.387
PERCENT. AND THEN HUMAN

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:38.222
SERVICES PROGRAMS HAVE TENDED

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:39.290
TO GROW FASTER THAN AVERAGE

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:40.024
FASTER THAN FIVE AND A HALF

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:41.959
PERCENT IN PARTICULAR IN HOME

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.394
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:44.329
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WHICH

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:47.732
HAVE BROWN. ACTUALLY QUITE

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:48.366
QUICKLY COMPARED TO OTHER STATE

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:51.436
PROGRAMS. TURNING TO THE NEXT

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:52.870
PAGE I'M GONNA START TALKING

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:54.739
INTO THE SECOND SECTION OF THE

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:56.541
PRESENTATION WHICH IS ABOUT HOW

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:57.141
STATE EXPENDITURES ARE

00:32:57.208 --> 00:33:00.411
ORGANIZED. AND I'M GONNA BEGIN

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:02.647
WITH AS A JUST AN OVERVIEW OF

00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:04.115
HOW FUNDS ARE ORGANIZED IN THE

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:06.317
STATE BUDGET. SO THERE ARE

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:08.252
THREE TYPES. OF FUNDS IN THE

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.554
STATE BUDGET THE FIRST IS THE

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.622
GENERAL FUND. SECOND OR SPECIAL

00:33:11.689 --> 00:33:12.557
FUNDS OF WHICH THERE ARE

00:33:12.623 --> 00:33:14.058
HUNDREDS AND THEN THIRD IS

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:16.094
FEDERAL FUNDS. THE GENERAL FUND

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.328
IS THE STATE'S MAIN OPERATING

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:19.597
ACCOUNT IT IS THE FUNDED THAT

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:20.431
RECEIVES GENERAL PURPOSE

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:21.966
REVENUES LIKE PERSONAL INCOME

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:23.968
TAX SALES AND USE TAX REVENUES.

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:24.836
AND THE LEGISLAURE CAN

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:27.105
ALLOCATE FUNDS IN THE GENERAL

00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:28.873
FUND FOR ANY PUBLIC PURPOSE.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.742
SPECIAL FUNDS CONVERSELY ARE

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:32.143
THOSE FUNDS THAT ARE CREATED

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.512
FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES- AND THEY

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:36.114
RECEIVE DEDICATED REVENUE

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.349
SOURCES. THEN THE LEGISLATURE

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:39.417
HAS MUCH LESS FLEXIBILITY IN

00:33:39.484 --> 00:33:40.918
ALLOCATING SPECIAL FUNDS

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.120
LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY ONLY

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:43.755
ALLOCATE SPECIAL FUND REVENUES

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:45.223
CHIU PURPOSES FOR WHICH THAT

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:49.761
FUND WAS CREATED. AN EXAMPLE.

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:50.395
HERE WOULD BE THE MOTOR VEHICLE

00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:50.995
ACCOUNT. SO THIS IS A FUNDED

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:53.097
RECEIVES REVENUES FROM VEHICLE

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:55.733
REGISTRATION FEES LICENSE OUR

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.367
DRIVER'S LICENSE FEES AND THEN

00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:59.170
THE FUND CAN ONLY BE SPENT ON

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:01.272
TRANSPORTATION RELATED-

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:03.174
PROGRAMS. AND THEN FINALLY

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:04.642
THERE FEDERAL FUNDS FEDERAL

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:06.310
FUNDS ARE USUALLY DEDICATED TO

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:07.345
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS ARE PURPOSES

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:08.613
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.081
PROVIDE THE STATE WITH FUNDING

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:11.816
TO RUN A CERTAIN PROGRAMMER AS

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.251
A MATCH ON TOP OF STATE FUNDING

00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:14.585
FOR A PROGRAM AND OFTEN THIS

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:17.955
COMES WITH STRINGS ATTACHED

00:34:18.022 --> 00:34:18.423
SUCH THAT THE FEDERAL

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:18.990
GOVERNMENT SAYS. THIS IS HOW

00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:19.657
STATE HAS TO A THE PRO THIS HOW

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:22.293
THE STATE- IS REQUIRED TO

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.963
IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. THE NEXT

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.532
PAGE IS JUST A VISUAL

00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:28.833
DESCRIPTION OF THE GENERAL

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.968
FUND. AND THE MANY MANY STILL

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:33.504
HOT THOUGH HUNDREDS OF OUR

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:34.071
SPECIAL FUNDS THAT THE STATE

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:35.873
HAS. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.842
LARGE PIE CHART IN THE MIDDLE

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.210
THAT'S THE GENERAL FUND AND

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:41.612
THEN EACH OF THE SMALL CIRCLES

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.648
AROUND THE SIDE ABOUT HARD

00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:45.016
CHART ARE EACH OF THE

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.184
INDIVIDUAL SPECIAL FUNDS. THAT

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.185
THE STATE HAS ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY

00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:49.320
SOME OF THE VERY SMALL SPECIAL

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:49.887
FUNDS OR EVEN EXCLUDED FROM

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:53.157
THIS CHART. THE GENERAL FUND AS

YOU YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN SEE IN

00:34:54.358 --> 00:34:56.060
THIS IS THIS CHART IS. BY FAR

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:58.296
THE LARGEST IT'S A HUNDRED AND

00:34:58.362 --> 00:34:59.597
FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.065
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. AND

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:02.767
EACH OF THE SPECIAL FUNDS

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:05.002
COLLECTIVELY. ARE ABOUT SIXTY

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:06.404
BILLION DOLLARS BUT

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:08.105
INDIVIDUALLY OR- SPECIAL FUNDS

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:09.207
TEND TO YOU KNOW EVEN AT THEIR

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:11.843
LARGEST BE ONLY A COUPLE

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:12.343
BILLION OR A FEW BILLION

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:16.380
DOLLARS. US SOME PROGRAMS ARE.

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:17.081
ESSENTIALLY ENTIRELY GENERAL

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:18.483
FUND FUNDED THAT'S MOSTLY

00:35:18.549 --> 00:35:20.518
EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE.

00:35:20.585 --> 00:35:21.519
AND SOME PROGRAMS LIKE

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:22.453
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ARE

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.422
ALMOST ENTIRELY SPECIAL FUND

FUNDED WHEN IT COMES TO US

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.492
STATE FUNDS. AND THEN SOME

00:35:27.558 --> 00:35:29.060
PROGRAMS ARE A MIX OF THE TWO

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.661
SO HEALTH PROGRAMS N

00:35:30.728 --> 00:35:32.163
PARTICULAR TEND TO BE A MIX OF

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.798
GENERAL FUND FUNDED AND SPECIAL

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:37.235
FUNDS FUNDED. TURNING TO THE

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:41.372
NEXT PAGE. ON PAGE FIVE SO NOW

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:42.874
I'M GONNA TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:43.875
STATE EXPENDITURES ARE

00:35:43.941 --> 00:35:45.977
ORGANIZED AND THIS IS YOU KNOW

00:35:46.043 --> 00:35:48.312
THE CATEGORIES BY WHICH THE

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:49.847
STATE SPENDS MONEY SO THERE ARE

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:51.449
THREE CATEGORIES HERE STATE

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:53.651
OPERATIONS LOCAL ASSISTANCE IN

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:55.186
CAPITAL OUTLAY OF THE THREE

ASSISTANCE ARE BY FAR THE

00:35:58.289 --> 00:35:58.823
LARGEST IN THE ONES THAT WILL

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.691
FOCUS THE MOST ATTENTION ON IN

00:36:00.758 --> 00:36:02.026
THIS PRESENTATION. STATE

00:43:07.651 --> 00:43:08.819
WORKING AND HOW CAN IT WORK

00:43:08.886 --> 00:43:10.287
BETTER. THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:11.221
OF COSTS THAT TEND TO BE

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:13.590
EMBEDDED IN A DEPARTMENTS- HEAD

00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:16.360
QUARTER LINE THAT CAN BE SORT

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:18.862
OF. THAT OUR CENTRALIZED HOSPET

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:19.997
TEND TO HAVE DISTRIBUTED

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:22.499
BENEFITS SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:23.934
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS.

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:26.770
CAN BE PUT IN THIS CATEGORY BUT

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.839
THEY MIGHT BE STILL RELATED TO

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.107
DIRECT SERVICE PROVISION FOR

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:31.308
PEOPLE SO THEY MIGHT STILL.

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:32.276
HAVE SOME KIND OF PUBLIC

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.678
INTERFACE- IT JUST REALLY

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:35.245
DEPENDS ON HOW THE COSTS ARE

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:37.247
CATEGORIZED. THE SECOND

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:38.449
CATEGORY ACROSS WHICH IS MUCH

00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:40.317
SMALLER ARE STATEWIDE GENERAL

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:42.353
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. AND THESE

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:43.354
ARE COSTS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.422
CENTRALIZED STATE AGENCIES LIKE

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:47.191
THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:49.493
OR THE STATE TREASURER.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.627
ESSENTIALLY LET'S TAKE THE

00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:51.428
EXAMPLE OF THE STATE

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:53.597
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THIS IS-

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:55.466
AMOUNTS THAT ARE OR I'M SORRY

00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:56.667
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS THAT

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:58.068
HAVE BEEN CENTRALIZED IN A

00:43:58.135 --> 00:43:59.570
SINGLE ENTITY THAT ARE PROVIDED

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:01.638
ON BEHALF OF ALL DEPARTMENTS.

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:02.740
FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE STATE

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:03.974
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THEY RUN

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.442
PAYROLL FOR ALL STATE

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:06.443
DEPARTMENTS THEY ISSUE THE

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.544
PAYCHECKS FOR ALL STATE

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:08.846
DEPARTMENTS AND THEN STATE

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.014
DEPARTMENTS WILL PAY FOR THAT

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.648
SERVICE THROUGH THEIR BUDGET-

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:12.950
AS YOU KNOW I TO SHARE

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:14.451
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH OF THAT

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:16.253
SERVICE THEY'RE USING- THESE

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.921
COSTS TEND TO BE QUITE LOW LESS

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:21.558
THAN ONE PERCENT. OF THE STATE

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:24.828
DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET. SO TRYING

00:44:24.895 --> 00:44:27.097
TO THE NAY PAGE. WE'RE JUST

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:28.699
HERE PROVIDING SOMETHING'S. OF

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:30.467
PLACES WHERE HEAD QUARTER COSTS

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:33.337
IN PARTICULAR. HAD INCREASED

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:35.072
FOR STATE DEPARTMENTS- OVER THE

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:36.573
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND WE

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.975
PICKED THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:39.977
SHOWN HERE BECAUSE THEY- HAD

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:42.413
INCREASES THAT WERE LARGER IN

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:45.282
DOLLAR TERMS. AS YOU CAN SEE ON

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:48.252
THE CHART WE'VE GOT WE'RE

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:48.786
COMPARING TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:51.255
NINETEEN- TOTAL ADMINISTRATIVE

00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:53.757
HEADQUARTERED MINISTRY OF COSTS

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:55.025
TO TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:55.759
FOR EACH OF THESE FOUR

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:57.961
DEPARTMENTS THE TWO ON THE LEFT

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:59.430
ARSED PRIMARILY SPECIAL FUND

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:00.497
FUNDED APARTMENTS IN THE TWO ON

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:03.267
THE RIGHT. ARE PRIMARILY

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:04.835
GENERAL FUND FUNDED DEPARTMENTS.

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:09.306
AND. AND THEN THE TOP OF THE

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:12.309
GRAPHIC SHOWS THE SHARE OF THAT

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:13.377
DEPARTMENT'S HEADQUARTERS

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:14.912
ACROSS AS A TOTAL OF THEIR

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:16.747
PROGRAM COSTS AND THESE NUMBERS

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:19.149
AREN'T NECESSARILY DIRECTLY-

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.652
COMPARABLE TO ONE ANOTHER YOU

00:45:21.718 --> 00:45:23.520
KNOW FOR EXAMPLE DMB IS 10%

00:45:23.587 --> 00:45:25.622
VERSUS DDS AS 1% AND THAT'S

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:26.623
BECAUSE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.092
HAVE DIFFERENT PRACTICES WITH

00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:30.861
REGARD TO WHAT THEY CATEGORIZE

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:34.364
AS HEAD QUARTER RELATED COSTS.

00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:35.966
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TOP

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:37.935
OF THE- THE GRAPHIC GENERALLY

00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:39.870
HIGH COURT ACROSS TEND TO BE A

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:42.339
SMALL SHARE OF THE PROGRAM'S

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:44.141
OVERALL COSTS. SO THE FINAL

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:47.077
PAGE OF THE HANDOUT- PROVIDE

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:49.179
JUST WALKS THROUGH SOME REASONS

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:50.881
WHY THESE COSTS HAVE INCREASED

00:45:50.948 --> 00:45:52.149
AMONG THESE DEPARTMENTS IN

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:53.650
RECENT YEARS I'M ALL. YOU KNOW

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:54.751
KIND OF GO OVER ALL THESE

00:45:54.818 --> 00:45:57.721
POINTS- ONE BY ONE SINCE THERE

00:45:57.788 --> 00:45:58.922
ARE A LOT IN THERE ALREADY IN

00:45:58.989 --> 00:46:00.324
YOUR HAND UP IT JUST WANTED TO

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.492
TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THEMES

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:03.293
THAT ARE. TRUE ACROSS THESE

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.128
DEPARTMENTS AND SOME OTHERS IN

00:46:04.194 --> 00:46:06.697
THE STATE. SO ONE OF THEM IS I.

00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:08.999
T. PROJECTS I. T. PROJECTS- CAN

00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:10.968
BE. THE COST OF WHICH CAN BE

00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:12.236
BOOKED AT YOU KNOW THE HEAD

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:13.604
QUARTER LEVEL EVEN IF THAT I.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.305
T. PROJECT IS. IS REALLY ABOUT

00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:17.274
SERVICE DELIVERY SO ONE EXAMPLE

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.809
IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.511
HOSPITALS THEY'RE UNDERGOING AN

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:22.045
I. T. PROJECTS TO IMPROVE

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:23.080
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:26.984
SYSTEM. AND THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.986
IMPROVE. YOU KNOW COULD COULD

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:30.254
HELP TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.922
BUT IT'S BOOKED AS I

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:33.157
HEADQUARTERED CROSSED. ANOTHER

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:35.859
EXAMPLE IS FOR THE DMV- THEY'RE

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:36.793
UNDERGOING SOME EFFORTS TO

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.695
IMPROVE THEIR WEBSITE. AND

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:41.165
IMPROVE CHATBOT IMPLEMENTATION

00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:43.033
FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO-

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.302
COMMUNICATE WITH DMV EMPLOYEES.

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.236
AND THOSE ARE ALSO CONSIDERED

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:47.104
HEADQUARTERS COSTS OF THOSE ARE

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:48.038
ALL CONTRIBUTING TO THOSE

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:50.073
INCREASES IN COSTS. THE SECOND

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.309
GAME IS ABOUT HEADQUARTER

00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:53.410
RELOCATION. A FEW OF THESE

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:55.712
APARTMENTS ARE RELOCATING THEIR

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:57.714
HEADQUARTERS FOR- RELATED

00:46:57.781 --> 00:46:59.116
REASONS MOST OF THEM ARE

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:01.318
BECAUSE THE BUILDINGS THAT THE

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:02.319
HEADQUARTERS ARE CURRENTLY

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:03.954
HOUSED AND HAVE. HAD SOME

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.455
STRUCTURAL ISSUES OR SOME OTHER

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:07.124
KINDS OF HABITABILITY ISSUES

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.692
FOR EXAMPLE LEAKING PIPES

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:10.494
LEAKING WINDOWS- LEAKING

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:14.031
BALCONIES INTO- OFFICES BELOW.

00:47:14.097 --> 00:47:16.967
AND THOSE PROBLEMS. I HAVE- AS

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:19.403
A RESULT- LED THE STATE TO

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:20.904
RELOCATE THERE AND PULL THOSE

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.973
EMPLOYEES TO OTHER LOCATIONS IN

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.143
SACRAMENTO- THOSE EFFORTS ARE

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:30.514
GENERALLY UNDER WAY AND SO. AND

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:31.014
IN SOME CASES ARE ALMOST

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:33.517
FINISHED OUT SO WITH THAT I'M

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:36.553
HAPPY TO TAKE AN QUESTIONS OR

QUESTIONS. YES THANK YOU. I'M

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:14.324
OKAY SO GOING TO. THE YOUR

FIRST AID OR TALK ABOUT THAT

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:19.529
THE TREND IN THE STATE BUDGET.

00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:21.365
THIS THAT THEY AND STATE

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:22.866
SPENDING BOTH IT FOR POINT FIVE

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:24.601
PER A YEAR THE LAST DECADE.

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:25.435
SUIT SO ARE STATE SPENDING HAS

00:48:25.502 --> 00:48:28.338
AND BY 55% IN THE LAST DECADE

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:32.542
IS THAT. ACCURATE NO JUST FIVE

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:33.744
AND A HALF ANNUAL AVERAGE

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:37.514
GROWTH. SO FIVE FIVE POINT FIVE

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:39.082
PERCENT. I DON'T KNOW IF I

00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:41.118
COULD DO THAT ARE YOU ASKING

00:48:41.184 --> 00:48:42.786
FOR THE COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH.

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.354
YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GET

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:44.988
I'M SORRY I CAN'T DO THAT. MATH

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:50.894
IN MY HEAD. WITH. ONE YEAH SO

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:52.929
IT'S AROUND SO IT'S AROUND A

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:55.832
FIFTY IT'S AROUND A 50% GROWTH

00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:58.302
IN SPENDING. I'M AND I GUESS

00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.736
WHAT I'M WHAT I'M TRYING TO

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:02.439
WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IS. TIED

00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:04.341
INTO IF ALL THINGS WITH ALL

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:06.243
THINGS BEING EQUAL SO AND

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:06.877
OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THAT SPENDING

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.078
HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:09.913
IN SERVICES BUT- IF ALL THINGS

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.316
WERE EQUAL HOW MUCH WOULD WE

00:49:12.382 --> 00:49:15.118
HAVE EXPECTED. ARE SPENDING TO

00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:16.653
HAVE GROWN OVER THE COURSE OF

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.722
THE LAST TEN YEARS. LIKE IF WE

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:20.424
LOOK AT THE POPULATION GROWTH

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:25.195
AND AT THE RATE OF INFLATION.

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:27.364
YEAH ACTUALLY I. EXPECTED IT TO

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:29.866
BE. SURE IT'S NOT HERE- BUT

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:31.368
ACTUALLY IF YOU DO THIS GRAPH

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:32.636
JUST RELATIVE TO THE STATE'S

00:49:32.703 --> 00:49:34.538
POPULATION AND INFLATION USING

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:36.373
THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THEN

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.708
YOU GOT A PRETTY SIMILAR RESULT

00:49:37.774 --> 00:49:39.643
THAT- IN REAL TERMS THE STATE

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.845
SPENDING HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:47.250
FLAT OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES.

00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:49.953
I'M OKAY. GIVE ME DOUBLE CHECK

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.254
THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:53.123
AVERAGE SO I AM PRETTY SURE THE

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.458
AVERAGE INFLATION RATE OVER THE

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:57.461
COURSE OF. THE LAST DECADE IS

00:49:57.527 --> 00:50:01.998
LIKE ONE POINT 77% AND OUR

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:02.532
POPULATION GROWTH HAS BEEN

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:05.569
SOMETHING LIKE. JOINT 7% SO I

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:09.573
THINK THAT. IF SERVICES WERE

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:11.241
WERE HELD EQUAL I AM PRETTY

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.243
SURE THAT OUR STATE SPENDING

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:13.877
PER YEAR WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:16.580
LIKE TWO POINT 4% GROWTH AS

00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:17.981
OPPOSED TO FIVE POINT 5%

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:20.050
GROWTH. I DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:21.451
LOOK AT THE U. S. CAN LIKE FACT

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:23.920
CHECK THOSE NUMBERS ARE ARE DO

00:50:23.987 --> 00:50:25.122
THAT DO THAT QUICKLY I JUST

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:26.256
THINK WOULD BE USEFUL TO

00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:27.591
UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE BASELINE

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:30.093
BECAUSE CLEARLY IF OUR STATE

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.629
SPENDING IS GROWING AT A RATE

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:37.267
THAT IS MUCH HIGHER THAN.

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:38.135
POPULATION AND INFLATION. WE

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:39.336
SHOULD BE SEEN IN A PRE. AND

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:40.637
REALLY MEANINGFUL INCREASE IN

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:43.740
SERVICES FOR. THAT ADDITIONAL

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:45.475
SPENDING AND MAYBE WE ARE BUT I

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:46.910
THINK IT JUST WOULD BE USEFUL

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:47.811
FOR ALL OF US HAVE A BASS LINE

00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:51.581
ON WHAT WOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN IN

00:50:51.648 --> 00:50:52.983
IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW TWENTY

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:55.852
TWENTY COMPARED TO TWENTY TO.

00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:57.921
SURE YEAH I'M HAPPY TO- CHECK

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:59.156
ON THE NUMBERS FOR YOU I THINK

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.557
IT IT PARTLY DEPENDS ON WHEN

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:02.359
INFLATION INDEX YOU USE SO.

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:03.660
THEIR INFLATION INDEX THE

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:04.928
INDICES FOR EXAMPLE THERE

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:06.263
CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC VERSUS

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.298
NATIONAL THE NATIONAL ONES TEND

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:10.667
TO BE LOWER THAN THE CALIFORNIA

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:12.402
SPECIFIC. AND SO YEAH. OKAY GET

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:13.470
THAT WOULD JUST BE GREAT FOR ME

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:15.505
JUST KIND OF GROUND. LIKE WHAT

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:17.207
I'M COMPARING SUBJECTS I THINK.

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:18.708
IN SOME CASES IT IT DOES MAKE

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:20.744
SENSE TO COMPARE. SPENDING

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:24.915
GROWTH. TO AT THE GROWTH OF OUR-

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:26.383
BUT IN IN MANY CASES THAT

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.584
ACTUALLY MAKES MORE SENSE LOOK

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:28.752
AT LIKE PUTS THE GROWTH THE

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:30.921
POPULATION- THAT THE GROWTH THE

00:51:30.987 --> 00:51:31.755
SERVICES SO THAT WE CAN REALLY

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:34.257

BETWEEN THE LOCAL SYSTEMS AND-

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:56.072
STATE OPERATIONS FUNDING

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:56.639
EVERITT IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:59.142
THE- REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:01.845
GRANTS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:03.580
PROVIDES A LOT OF TV JUST

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:05.982
FUNDING NOT FUNDING IS A SPLIT

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:07.851
BETWEEN LOCAL ASSISTANCE WHICH

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:08.451
IS YOU KNOW FUNDING THAT GOES

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:10.420
OUT TO EITHER THE HEALTH

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:10.987
RESTRICTIONS COMMUNITY BASED

PROVIDERS IN COMMUNITIES. AND

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:16.793
THEN THERE'S A PORTION FOR THE

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.895
STATE TO EITHER ASSIST OR OR DO

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:20.830
A STATEWIDE PROGRAM IT'S REALLY

00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:23.266
A CASE BY CASE BASIS BY BY

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:26.035
GRANT. IN ON THE SPECIAL SIDE.

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:27.337
THE KNOW THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:30.073
RANGE OF USES I THINK THE PH

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:31.374
STANDS OUT OF ABOUT SIXTY

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:33.676
SPECIAL FUNDS RANGING FROM

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:35.845
TOBACCO DEPARTMENT HEALTH TO

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:36.946
AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE SO IT

00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:38.114
REALLY DEPENDS ON THE PROGRAM

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:41.050
IT'S THAT IT'S A VERY BROAD AND

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:42.952
DIVERSE POOL FUNDS AND- ISSUES

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:43.786
THAT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC

00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:45.922

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:09.779
FOR OUR LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO

00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:11.814
SPEND. I BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.216
BE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:14.851
OVERSIGHT OVER HOW THOSE FUNDS

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:17.420
ARE BEING SPENT- AT THE MOMENT

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:18.454
SOME OF THOSE FUNDS CAN GO

00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:20.089
TOWARDS ACTIVITIES THAT OUR

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:22.225
SHERIFFS ARE. PERFORMING AND

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.426
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:24.994
SURE THOSE FUNDS ARE DEDICATED

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:27.330
TOWARDS THOSE INTENDED PURPOSES

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:29.098
LIKE SMOKING CESSATION. OUR

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:30.700

MANY OF THE DEDICATED FUNDS. TO

MAKE SURE THEY'RE GOING TOWARDS

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:49.786
THEIR INTENDED PURPOSES. BUT

00:59:49.852 --> 00:59:51.220
ALONG THOSE LINES I DO WANT TO

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:52.922
TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE IS

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:55.091
I BELIEVE A- LARGE PART OF OUR

00:59:55.158 --> 00:59:56.793
COMMUNITY HAS REALLY WANTED TO

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:59.162

READING THIS CORRECTLY IT

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:09.772
APPEARS THAT THE JUDICIAL

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:12.208
BRANCH IS PREDOMINANTLY FUNDED

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:14.077
BY LOCAL ASSISTANCE. IN THE

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:15.111
FORM READING THE RIGHT

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:16.779
PARAGRAPH OF TWENTY ONE

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:18.715
BILLION. IT SEEMS THAT THREE

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.450
QUARTERS OF THAT TWENTY ONE

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:21.718
BILLION LOOKS TOWARDS. GOING

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:23.453
TOWARDS LOCAL ASSISTANCE I

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:25.054

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.756
SIXTEEN BILLIONGIVE OR TAKE.

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:29.058
IS WHAT WE ARE SENDING DOWN TO

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.660
OUR LOCALS AND SO I'D LIKE TO

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:32.028
ASK THAT FIRST QUESTION IF I

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:35.264
COULD TOWARDS THE L. A. O. WHAT

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.333

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.469
THAT WE ARE PASSING DOWN TO.

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:42.305
OUR JUDICIAL BRANCH. WHAT IS IT

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:43.306
THAT WE'RE FUNDING WITH THOSE

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:47.076

FOR MORE DETAIL ON THIS PROGRAM

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:55.451
BECAUSE- WE HAVE ONLY A FEW

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:57.320
NUMBER OF STAFF HERE TODAY AND

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:58.621
NONE OF US KNOW THE JUDICIAL

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.556
BRANCH IN DETAIL- BUT I WILL

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.392
SAY THAT THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.827
FUNDS ARE THOSE FUNDS THAT ARE-

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:07.363
FOR. COURT SYSTEMS THAT ARE

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.800
LOCALLY ADMINISTERED AND- I DO

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:12.201
APPRECIATE AND I'M HAPPY TO

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:14.737
FOLLOW UP I WOULD. HIGHLIGHT IF

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:17.740
I COULD- THE NATIONAL I'VE BEEN

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.108
PORING OVER A DOCUMENT THE L.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:21.511
A. O. GAVE TO US THAT EVALUATED

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.746
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUNDING

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:25.481
OF OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND OUR

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:26.983
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS I THINK

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.584
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF A

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:29.919
CONVERSATION WE WILL NEED TO

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:31.654
HAVE NEXT YEAR. ABOUT HOW WE

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:32.755
ENSURE THAT THE SCALES OF

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:35.058
JUSTICE ARE BALANCED IN OUR

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:36.826
EQUAL AND SO AS WE'RE HAVING

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.327
THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:40.263
IS BEING FUNDED BY THE LOCALS

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:42.398
AND PAID FOR BY THE STATE. I

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:43.766
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.768
WORK TOWARDS WHAT SHOULD BE

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:47.370
JUSTICE AND THE SCALES OF

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:49.439
JUSTICE I'M NO LAWYER BUT THEY

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:51.207
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EQUAL AND%

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:52.108
THAT SHOULD MEAN YOU'RE HAVING

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:54.077
EQUAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:56.412
APPLY FOR THAT. SO WHAT I

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:58.247
APPRECIATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.116

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:12.328
RESOURCE RECYCLING AND RECOVERY

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.564

MULTI YEAR. SO I DON'T HAVE

WELL WE ONLY HAVE PRELIMINARY

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:36.565
DATA SO FAR- IT IS LOOKING ALSO

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:37.900
LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE SIMILARLY

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:39.468
STRONG AND AHEAD OF PROJECTIONS

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:41.170
WITHHOLDING FOR EXAMPLE HAS

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.772
REMAINED PRETTY STRONG IN

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:43.306
TWENTY TWENTY SURPRISINGLY

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:45.775
PERHAPS- COMPARED TO TWENTY

01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:47.677
NINETEEN. AND SO WHILE

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.078
CERTAINLY THE STATE COULD FACE

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.347
ANOTHER BUDGET PROBLEM IN

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:51.981
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IT'S ALSO

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.649
POSSIBLE THAT THE STATE EITHER

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:54.583
WON'T HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR AS

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.585
LARGE OF A BUDGET PROBLEM AT

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:57.186
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THAT IT

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:58.554
HAD IN THIS YEAR. OR THAT IT

01:05:58.621 --> 01:05:59.922
MIGHT EVEN NOT HAVE A BUDGET

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:01.424
PROBLEM IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.592
TWO SO THAT'LL BE AN IMPORTANT-

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.294
QUESTION AN ASSESSMENT THAT WE

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:06.462

OPTIMISM BUT D. I DON'T DO YOU

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:18.941
HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT WE WILL

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:22.011
BUDGET SITUATION NEXT YEAR. NO

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:24.380
NOT AT ALL- WE VERY WELL COULD

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.614
SEE A BUDGET PROBLEM NEXT YEAR

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.016
IT WAS JUST IT MEANT MERELY I

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:28.417
WAS TRYING TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:29.785
A CERTAINTY THAT WE WILL SEE A

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:31.387
BUDGET PROBLEM NEXT YEAR OR

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:32.521
THAT IF WE DO SEE ABOUT YOUR

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:33.723
PROBLEM. THERE IS IT YOU KNOW

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.558
OKAY OKAY SHE GOT VERY GOOD

01:06:35.624 --> 01:06:36.525
CHANCE THAT IT WON'T BE AS BAD

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:38.994
AS THE IS THIS HUGE FIFTY FOUR

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:40.863
HISTORICAL BIT FIFTY FOUR

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:43.165
BILLION HISTORIC BUDGET PROBLEM

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.100
THAT WE HAD IN TWENTY ONE

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.468
TWENTY TWO. SURE IT'S ARE AT

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:46.802
ALL RELATIVE I MEAN HOPEFULLY

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.304
IT'S- NOT AS BAD AS FIFTY FOUR

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.306
BILLION BUT- IF IT'S- THIRTY

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:50.873
EIGHT BILLION THAT'S STILL

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.176
PRETTY. A DIFFICULT- BUT- IN

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:56.178
TERMS OF- BUT YOU DO

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:57.446
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT.

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.281
THERE IS A NEED I GUESS TO

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.784
FOCUS ON. GROWING THE ECONOMY.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:05.087
AND TO ADDRESS. A LOT OF OUR

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:06.222
BUDGET BUDGETARY CONCERNS.

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:09.024
THAT'S TRUE YEAH I THINK WHAT

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:10.493
OUR OFFICE WOULD SAY IN TERMS

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:11.727
OF THE ROLE OF THE STATE

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:13.396
GOVERNMENT IS THAT THE MOST

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:14.597
EFFECTIVE WAY FOR THE STATE

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:16.499
GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE THE

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:17.633
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR THE STATE

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.969
IS REALLY IN- CONTROLLING THE

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.337
VIRUS AND ALLOWING THE STATE

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:22.972
ECONOMY TO RE OPEN IN THAT

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.640
AVENUE BECAUSE THE STATE

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.442
CONSTITUTION PREVENTS THE STATE

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.077
FROM DEFICIT SPENDING SIMILAR

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:29.211
TO HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.846
CAN DO SO IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:33.048
FOR THE STATE TO DO WHAT YOU

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:33.883
THINK OF THIS CLASSIC STIMULUS

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.584
SPENDING. BUT RATHER THAT THE

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:36.619
STATE'S STRENGTHS ARE REALLY

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:37.720
AND YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:39.355
HEALTH DEMAND BUT THEN ALSO IN

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:41.157
MITIGATING VIA FAX THE ECONOMIC

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.025
EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:45.060
ENSUING RECESSION FOR SPECIFIC

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:47.163
INDIVIDUALS FOR BUSINESSES IN A

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:49.899
TARGETED WAY. THE L. A. O. HAVE

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.367
ANY. PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:53.068
HOW THE STATE. COULD PROVIDE

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:55.070
MORE CERTAINTY I GUESS TO

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:57.106
BUSINESSES I MEAN CERTAINLY. WE

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:58.207
ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO

01:07:58.274 --> 01:07:59.475
GET. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.010
CHALLENGE AND WE NEED TO GET

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:02.411
CODED UNDER CONTROL BUT- HOW DO

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:05.314
YOU. I HAVE MY I GUESS MY

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:06.282
QUESTION IS WE HAVE TO DO BOTH

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:07.683
AT THE SAME TIME KOBE DOES

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.552
EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY. AND AT

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:10.519
THE SAME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:13.489
BALANCE PUBLIC HEALTH WITH. THE

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:17.293
REALITY OF JUST THE REAL WORLD.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.495
SELL EACH IS A DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.497
SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF HOW DO

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.232
YOU PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:25.234
BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:28.771
TRYING TO RE OPEN. YEAH I MEAN

01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:30.206
I AGAIN I THINK OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.007
IS THAT THE STATE CAN PROVIDE

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:34.243
TARGETED ASSISTANCE OR PLACES

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.011
WHERE THE STATE CAN COMPLEMENT

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:37.379
EFFORTS THAT ARE ONGOING BY THE

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:38.380
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THESE

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:39.815
AREAS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:41.350
MOST RECENT BUDGET THERE WAS

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:42.885
THE HIRING TAX CREDIT THE

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.720
PROVIDED A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.324
INDIVIDUAL HIRED- YEAH- AT IN A

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.059
CERTAIN TIME FRAME THERE'S ALSO

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.160
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS THAT WERE

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:52.695
AUTHORIZED BY THE GOVERNOR.

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.196
THAT WERE INTENDED TO TARGET

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:55.397
BUSINESSES THAT WERE NOT

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:56.665
ELIGIBLE FOR THE PAYCHECK

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:57.867
PROTECTION PROGRAM THE FEDERAL

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:00.102
PROGRAM- AND THESE KINDS OF

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:01.570
EFFORTS ARE EXAMPLES OF PLACES

01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:02.972
WHERE THE STATE CAN PERHAPS

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.940
COMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL EFFORT

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:06.442
BUT CERTAINLY CAN. UNDERTAKE

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:09.845
THE SAME KIND OF FINANCIAL

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:10.379
PRESENCE THAT THE FEDERAL

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:13.015
GOVERNMENT CAN. OKAY IN IN

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.416
TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF YOUR

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:17.119
CHARTS AND- AND THE SPENDING

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:18.854
EXPENDITURES THAT YOU

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.456
HIGHLIGHTED. ARE THERE ANY

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:22.024
TRENDS THAT CONCERNED THE L. A.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.859
L. OR THEIR TRENDS THAT WE

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:26.161
SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON. ARE THERE

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:28.531
TARGETED REDUCTIONS THAT YOU

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:28.998
WOULD SUGGEST OR THEIR

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:31.400
EXPENDITURES THAT. THAT WE AS A

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:34.103
STATE SHOULD NOT BE MAKING OR

01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:37.172
TO RE EVALUATE. YOU KNOW.

01:09:37.239 --> 01:09:38.474
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A VERY

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:39.608
SWEEPING QUESTIONING CAN REALLY

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.677
DEPEND ON THE INDIVIDUAL

01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:45.080
PROGRAM I AM. I THINK THAT IT'S

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:46.382

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:48.117
BASIS AND OUR OFFICE IS ALWAYS

THAT DEPARTMENT MISSION REALLY

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:56.258
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.127
GET OUT OF IT- IS THE PROGRAM

01:09:58.193 --> 01:09:59.461

HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM AND THE

L. A. O. AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED.

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:24.286
THAT THE STATE SHOULD PROBABLY

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.754
NOT MOVE FORWARD OR OR IF THE

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:26.722
STATE DOES MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.486
OF THEM. I'M SO TO THE EXTENT

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:59.188
THAT THE STATE THOUGH PULLED

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:01.056
BACK MONEY FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:02.591
ASSOCIATED WITH GREENHOUSE GAS

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:03.759
REDUCTION FUND THAT WOULDN'T

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.494
NECESSARILY ADDRESS THE BUDGET

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:06.261
PROBLEM WHICH IS A GENERAL FUND

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:09.331
PROBLEM- ALSO. YOU KNOW SORT OF

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:10.499
A NOTE OF CAUTION ON THAT IS

01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:11.967
THAT THE- FEDERAL FUNDING

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:13.302
PROVIDED TO DATE IS ABOUT THREE

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:15.371
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:17.039
IF THE STATE YOU KNOW- TOOK

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.807
SPECIFIC ACTIONS AROUND HIGH

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:20.376
SPEED RAIL THAT JEOPARDIZE.

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:21.510
THAT FUTURE THAT FEDERAL

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:23.345
FUNDING BECAUSE OF CHANGES TO

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:24.480
THE AGREEMENT THAT THE STATE

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:25.214
HAS MADE WITH THE FEDERAL

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.615
GOVERNMENT. THERE'S CHANCES

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:27.783
THAT THAT MONEY WOULD NEED TO

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.084
BE REPAIRED SO OBVIOUSLY THIS

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:29.818
IS A VERY DELICATE ISSUE AND

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:31.854
IT'S NOT MY- A PARTICULAR

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.988
PROGRAM AREA WE'VE NOW

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.123
EXHAUSTED MY KNOWLEDGE OF HIGH

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:36.825
SPEED RAIL- BUT- YOU KNOW WHAT.

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:38.093
FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS HAPPY TO

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.395
REFER YOU TO THE STAFF WITHIN

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.729
OUR OFFICE AND I MEAN TO PUT

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:43.132
YOU ON THE SPOT I JUST IT'S ONE

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.133
OF TOSE. THOSE GUYS. AGREE

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:45.901
JUST EXAMPLES OF STATE

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.302
EXPENDITURES THAT I THINK AND

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:48.437
WE THE LEGISLATURE. ARE

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:50.973
GRAPPLING WITH. I DO LOVE I DO

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.443
APPRECIATE. YOUR THE

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:55.678
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED.

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.913
CERTAINLY MY PERSONAL VIEW IS

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.650
THAT. YOU KNOW. WE IN A WORLD

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:02.751
OF OBVIOUSLY GIVEN A KIND OF A

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:03.986
FALSE CHOICE THAT WE GOING TO

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:05.220
DO THIS OR THAT WE GOTTA DO

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:06.622
YOU. PUBLIC HEALTH ARE WE GOING

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:07.856
TO PROTECT THE ECONOMY BY I

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:09.792
THINK WE ARE CHALLENGED TO HAVE

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.927
TO DO BOTH. AND SO. FROM MY

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.228
PERSPECTIVE AS WE'RE DEALING

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:14.830
WITH THE WITH THE BUDGET AND

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:15.330
HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:17.166
IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS. I THINK

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:18.300
WE DO HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:22.571
A WAY TO- SAFELY- REOPEN THE

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:23.539
ECONOMY WILL CONTROLLING COVE

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:24.473
IT AND THAT MEANS THAT WE GOT

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.041
TO GIVE BUSINESSES CERTAINTY. I

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.242
DO BELIEVE THAT WE PROBABLY

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:28.544
NEED TO FREEZE TAXES AND FEES

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:29.244
WHERE THEY ARE AND GIVE SMALL

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:30.813
BUSINESSES THE CHANCE- TO

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:33.749
RECOVER. AND I THINK MOVING

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:34.516
FORWARD I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.618
BUDGET. WILL DECISIONS ARE

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:43.092
GOING TO BE VERY DIRE. AND

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:43.692
DIFFICULT NEXT YEAR AND SO WE

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:44.359
NEED TO BEGIN HAVE TOUGH. THANK

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.260
PROCESS WITHOUT A- THE CHAIR

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:46.328
FOR PUTTING THE COMMITTEE

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:47.329
HEARING TO. BECAUSE I THINK

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:48.864
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A VERY

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:49.431
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THANK

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:54.336
YOU. THANK YOU MISPERTON I

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:56.939
THANK YOU JUST WHAT FIRST OF

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:57.639
ALL THIS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR

01:12:57.706 --> 01:13:00.008
THE OVERALL BUDGET DISCUSSION

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:01.944
BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S OUR

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:02.878
HUNDRED AND TWENTY LAWMAKERS

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.947
AND EIGHTY IN THE ASSEMBLY OUR

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:06.648
CONSTITUENTS YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:08.851
ALWAYS ASKING WHY CAN'T WE CUT

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:10.552
TAXES OR PUT MORE MONEY TO OUR

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:12.321
SCHOOLS OUR MONEY FROM HIGH

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:14.189
SPEED RAIL TO USE YOU SEE AND

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:16.225
SO I THINK THIS IS A REALITY AS

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:17.226
FAR AS WHERE THE MONEY GOES

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:19.261
AND- WHERE IT'S WORKED WITH THE

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.329
TRENDS ARE AND WHAT THE

01:13:20.395 --> 01:13:23.899
OPPORTUNITIES ARE SO- IT. I

01:13:23.966 --> 01:13:25.267
JUST HAVE A COUPLE MAYBE. NEW

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:26.802
WANTS QUESTIONS IN AB ONE BIG

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:29.638
BIG PICTURE. SO ONE THING IS I

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:31.640
KNOW THAT MR ARAMBULA MENTIONED

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.742
HIGHER EDUCATION WE DO LOVE OUR

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:36.145
NEW. A CSU LEADER I KNOW WE'RE

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.713
GOING TO HEAR FROM THE UC

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.481
BECAUSE ON THIS CHART IT SAYS

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:42.885
THAT THE LAST DECADE. THE CSU.

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:44.920
GROWTH HAS BEEN ABOUT WHAT IT

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.455
LOOKS LIKE ABOUT 8% AND THEN

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:49.658
CSU. IS ABOUT FIVE AND WE

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:51.360
USUALLY RY TO KEEP THEM.

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:53.729
ROUGHLY EQUAL YOU KNOW IT'S

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:54.997
KIND OF LIKE TWO SIBLINGS

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:56.698
FIGHTING FOR GIFTS AT THE

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:58.967
HOLIDAYS AND WANTS WANT PARITY.

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:02.304
SO WHAT CAN YOU. EXPLAIN THE

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.940
DIFFERENCE HERE WHAT CAN YOU DO

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.308
TO EXPLAIN THIS. YEAH THERE

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:07.042
WERE THERE WERE A FEW YEARS

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.178
WHERE- BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS FOR

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:11.280
UC AND CSU WERE PROVIDED. AT

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:13.081
THE SAME DOLLAR LEVEL BUT THAT

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:14.483
ACTUALLY REPRESENTED DIFFERENT

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:15.918
PERCENTAGE LEVELS OF EACH OF

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.187
THE EACH OF THEIR BUDGET SO NOW

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:19.655
YOU SEE IN CSU'S TOTAL BUDGETS

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:21.056
ARE ACTUALLY ROUGHLY THE SAME

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:21.990
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO ONE

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.225
ANOTHER BUT- A FEW YEARS AGO

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.660
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE AND SO

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:26.395
THE DOLLAR TERMS ESSENTIALLY

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:28.530
HAD CSU CATCH UP TO YOU SEE. IN

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.232
TERMS OF THEIR TOTAL BUDGET BUT

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:30.899
IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IT WAS

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:34.536
FASTER FOR CSU AND UC. OKAY AND

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:35.938
THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THAT WHERE

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:37.606
WE SPEND THE MAJORITY OF

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:39.675
GENERAL FUND MONEY. IT'S

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:42.878
CERTAINLY EDUCATION SO- PRODUCT

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:44.913
SO THE PROP AND HATE SCHOOL

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.449
EXPENDITURES UC AND CSU AND

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.518
HEALTH CARE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:51.920
WHERE THAT THE ANNUAL GROWTH

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:54.122
THE ON THE KAHNEMAN PAGE TO OF

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:55.991
COURSE. SO THE OUTLINED AS FAR

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:58.026
AS HEAVY SPENDING THE LAST

01:14:58.093 --> 01:15:01.363
DECADE. THIRD THERE NOT A LOT

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.131
OF. ONE BIG DOLLAR AMOUNT

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:05.334
BUDGET AREAS THANK THE HIGHER

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.336
AT THE K. TWELVE IS. IT LOOKS

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:09.004
LIKE. AND IT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:12.875
4% AND THEN IS IT WE LOOK AT

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:15.744
MEDIKAL. IS THAT THIS IS THAT

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:18.447
THE TOTAL. OR JUST THE STATE

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:22.618
PORTION. THIS IS JUST STATE

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.953

INCLUDED FEDERAL FUNDS MEDICAL

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:28.724
WOULD BE GROWING MUCH FASTER SO

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:31.059
FOR MEDICARE HOW THAT'S REALLY

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:34.062
NOT THAT. A YOU KNOW A POLICY

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:37.032
CHOICE THAT'S THAT'S CASELOAD

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:38.867
RIGHT THAT'S RESPONDING TO

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:41.870
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FOR HELP

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.272
NEEDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND-

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.607
HILL. THE RURAL IRVINE CENTRAL

CALIFORNIA. THAT AS WELL AS

01:15:50.946 --> 01:15:53.282
JUST POPULATION GROWTH RIGHT.

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:55.918
YEAH THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF-

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:57.953
MEDICAL SPENDING R. ONE CHANGES

01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.488
IN POLICY SO OF COURSE WITH THE

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:00.656
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEN

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:05.394
THAT. OPTIONAL EXPANSION THAT

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.461
WAS REALLY A BIG DRIVER OF TO

01:16:06.528 --> 01:16:07.229
MEDIKAL GENERAL FUND GROWTH

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:08.897
OVER TIME FOR AS THE STATE

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.866
MATCH FOR TOTAL FUNDING WENT

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:11.934
DOWN IN THE PARKS RIGHT THIS

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:12.968
SHOULD STATE MATCH WENT UP AND

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:14.770
FEDERAL FUNDING ATCH WENT DOWN

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:15.604
FOR THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.873
POPULATION- AND THEN THE SECOND

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.074
BIG CATEGORIES OF COST AS YOU

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:20.442
POINT OUT OUR CASELOAD

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:22.444
UTILIZATION AND PRICES AND IN

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.346
PARTICULAR PRICES CAN BE- A

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:28.617
PRETTY DRIVING. COST FACTOR AS

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:31.219
FOR EXAMPLE PHARMACEUTICAL

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:32.754
COSTS HAVE GONE UP. YEAH AND

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:37.125
THEN- WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:40.495
OPPORTUNITIES POTENTIALLY TO

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:42.064
MAKE OTHER EXPENDITURES IF WE

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.999
HADN'T DIFFERENCE IF YOU LOOK

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:46.702
AT. BUCKETS AND POTS OF

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.937
RESOURCES WHERE WOULD YOU GO

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:52.507
FIND. THOSE AND AGAIN I MEAN I

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.109
KNOW THE ANSWER BUT HE COULD

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:54.710
JUST REMIND US IS LIKE IF YOU

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:58.246
WANTED TO. YOU KNOW IT CUT

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:01.883
TAXES OR YOU KNOW FOCUS ON

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.485
RESPONDING TO TWO COVETED FOR

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:05.721
RENT RELIEF FOR PROGRAMS FOR

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.322
<u>MALL BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW SO</u>

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.758
WHAT PARTS OF THE BUDGET WOULD

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:14.129
YOU TAKE FROM TO DO THAT. OKAY

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:15.230
SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.798
IS WHERE DOES THE LEGISLATURE

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:17.799
HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:18.767
REDUCTIONS BECAUSE THE

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:20.102
LEGISLATURE ALWAYS HAS TO PASS

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:22.170
A BALANCED BUDGET SO ANY TIME

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:23.605
YOU KNOW ONE SPENDING INCREASE

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:24.973
SPENDING IS INCREASED OR

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.509
REVENUES ARE REDUCED- THAT IS

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:28.910
SORT OF BY DEFINITION GOING TO

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:30.145
HAVE TO MEAN THAT THE BUDGET

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:31.747
HAS TO MAKE REDUCTIONS IN

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:32.447
ANOTHER PLACE EITHER REVENUE

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:33.949
INCREASE IN ANOTHER PLACE OR

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:34.950
EXPENDITURE REDUCTION AND OTHER

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.852
PLACES- THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:37.919
QUITE CNSTRAINED IN MAKING

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:39.488
REDUCTIONS IN CERTAIN AREAS OF

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.189
THE BUDGET FOR EXAMPLE AROUND

01:17:41.256 --> 01:17:43.125
THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. I

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:44.026
REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:45.460
CONSTITUTIONAL THE LEGISLATURE

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:46.728

THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:51.700
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:52.534
THOSE PROGRAMS TEND TO BE

BONNER THE EDUCATION BOND. SO I

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:08.743
GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.645
THERE'S BEEN. IDEAS ABOUT HOW

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.013
WE COULD HAVE IT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.483

GEO BONDING AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:35.837
THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL

WHETHER THAT WERE AT- A LOAN

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:41.877
OUT RIGHT NOW SO CONSIDER IT.

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:42.444
OTHER BOND MEASURES IN THE

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.446
FUTURE ANOTHER IS AT LEAST ONE

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:45.046
OF THE BALLOT RIGHT NOW AND I

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:47.215
THINK. ANOTHER IDEA TO PUT AN

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:50.018
AD BOND BACK ON THE BALLOT.

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:53.054

OF MY HEAD OR IN FRONT OF ME I

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:59.027
DON'T BUT- I MIGHT ASK IF THE

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.262
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE KNOWS.

NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION WITH

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:17.579

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:20.182
SURE. SOME OF THE POP UP IN A

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:21.816
FEW SECONDS BUT LET ME JUST

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.585
FLIP TO IT TO ANOTHER AS FAR AS

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.453
THAT THE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.955
RETIREES THAT'S ALWAYS BROUGHT

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:28.890
UP A LOT AS FAR AS- STATE

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:32.727
OBLIGATIONS AND- YOU KNOW-

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:36.498
LIABILITIES FOUR. FOUR HEAT.

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.200
ESPECIALLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.367
ALSO FOR STATE TO EVERYBODY IN

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:41.803
THE FUTURE- DO WE ANTICIPATE

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:45.073
THAT TO REMAIN. RELATIVELY

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.075
STEADY OR IS THAT. GOING O BE

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:48.343
INCREASED OVER THE IN THE OUT

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:52.447
YEARS. I MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:53.615
HAVE SHOWN RETIREE HEALTH

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.784
BENEFITS CONTINUING TO GROWING

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:58.353
COST WITH- JUST GENERAL RISES

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.355
IN HEALTH CARE COSTS AND SINCE

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:01.523
YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.259
RISING- ARE COSTS TO PROVIDE

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:05.594
BENEFITS FOR HOW RETIREE HEALTH

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.829
IS ALSO RISING ANOTHER THING TO

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.397
NOTE ABOUT RETIREE HEALTH IS

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:11.099
THAT THE STATE- BEGAN I'VE

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:13.034
FOUGHT BEGAN A PLAN TO PRE FUND

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:15.670
RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS IN THE

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:16.271
TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BUDGET.

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:18.306
THROUGH THE BARGAINING- PROCESS

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:19.507
OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:22.277
SO STATE COSTS- FOR PRE FUNDING

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:23.745
OF RETIREE HEALTH HAVE ALSO

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:25.180
INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS

01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:26.481
ALTHOUGH I THINK YOU KNOW THE

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:27.115
WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT MIGHT

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:28.483
BE THAT THE STATE IS SETTING

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.518
ASIDE MORE MONEY TODAY- IN

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.120
ORDER TO PAY FOR THOSE COSTS IN

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:34.222
THE FUTURE AND IDEALLY. TO PAY

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:35.490
MUCH LESS IN THE FUTURE THAN IT

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.259
WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE HAD IT NOT

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:39.227
SET ASIDE THAT MONEY TODAY SURE

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:41.263
SO SPEAKING OF RETIREE HEALTH

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:43.131
THAT THERE THERE THERE ARE A

01:21:43.198 --> 01:21:43.765
LOT OF THINGS WE WANT TO DO IN

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:46.067
THE STATE BUDGET. DR RAMBLE AS

01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:47.435
SUBCOMMITTEE IN MIND THERE'S

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:49.638
LESS THERE ARE LINES FOR HOURS

01:21:49.704 --> 01:21:52.040
AND WE COULD SPEND OUR BUDGETS

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:54.409
TWO TIMES OVER ON OUR WISH LIST

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:55.677
AND WE JUST DON'T DON'T HAVE

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.379
THE RESOURCES AND SO YOU KNOW

01:21:57.445 --> 01:21:59.314
WHAT DO YOU DO YOU YOU YOU CUT

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:01.349
SPENDING OR YOU INCREASED TAX

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:02.917
REVENUE OR YOU HOPE THE ECONOMY

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:05.086
GROWS AND MAYBE A COMBINATION.

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:06.321
ONE THING THAT THAT POPS UP

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:07.689
EVERY NOW AND THEN IS THIS

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:11.493
ISSUE WITH- EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEE

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:14.362
HEALTHCARE RETIREES. AND THERE

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:15.930
IS THERE PROPOSALS THAT I'VE

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:17.399
HEARD OF BUT WHEN I WAS A LOCAL

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:19.734
GOVERNMENT TO AS FAR AS OUR

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:21.169
AREN'T STATE EMPLOYEES ARE

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:22.671
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES THAT

01:22:22.737 --> 01:22:25.507
AREN'T NECESSARILY SWITCHING TO

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:28.677
MEDICARE- WHEN THEY'RE- WHEN

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:35.350
THEY ARE DONE AGE ELIGIBLE WHEN

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:43.725
CORRECT. THE TWO LOOK AT I CAN.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:44.726
SIX SIXTY. AND SO I HAVE

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:45.660
THOUGHT A THAT A FAR AS TEAM

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:49.831
THAT WE COULD DO IN STATE LAW

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:52.067
TO BASICALLY- YOU KNOW HAVE

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.735
MORE OF OUR HAVE OUR IN OUR

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.770
INDIVIDUALS GO TO MEDICARE WE

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:56.671
ARE WE LEAVING MONEY ON THE

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:58.707
TABLE AND PAYING FOR HEALTH

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.108
CARE WITH STATE DOLLARS WHICH

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:02.077
WE COULD BE DRAWING DOWN

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.645
FEDERAL DOLLARS AND HAVING

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:05.180
THOSE INDIVIDUALS GOING ON

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:06.915
MEDICARE EVEN IF WE HAVE TO BUY

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:08.917
YOU KNOW LIKE THAT. COULD LEAD

01:23:08.983 --> 01:23:10.285
TO THAT ADVANTAGE MEDICARE

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:11.353
ADVANTAGE THE PLAN B. TO

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:13.588
WHATEVER TO GET THEM TO THE

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.023
SAME LEVEL WERE THAT. AND THEN

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.125
WE COULD USE THOSE FOR OTHER

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:26.101
PRIORITIES IN THE STATE BUDGET.

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:27.068
YEAH LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:28.937

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.623

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:27.742
THINGS IT'S THIS IS GREAT. BUT

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:30.077
BUT JUST LOOKING AT THE CHART

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:32.079
IT SEEMS MANY OF THESE ITEMS.

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:34.382
ARE ITEMS THAT WE CAN IN SOME

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:35.516
WAYS DON'T HAVE COMPLETE

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:37.218
CONTROL OVER OBVIOUSLY MET

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:39.520
MEDICARE WAS A VERY BIG. BUBBLE

01:32:39.587 --> 01:32:41.656
AND HEALTH CARE COSTS- WHILE

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:43.057
WE'RE TRYING TO MANAGE THEM.

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:44.759
ARE ALSO WHAT HEALTHCARE COSTS

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:50.197
ARE HIGH- DDS AND I HSS ARE

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:51.732
REFLECTION OF THE GROWING.

01:32:51.799 --> 01:32:53.968
POPULATIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:55.503
THOSE IN THOSE SOME COMMUTING

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:57.738
SAYS THAT IT'S NOT IT'S A FAIR

01:32:57.805 --> 01:32:59.740
ACCURATE STATEMENT REGARDING

01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:01.642
THOSE THREE HOURS. SCUMBAG TO

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:05.012
MISS HOLLINGSHEAD YEAH- SO YES

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.747
FOR IHS US AND DDS WE'VE SEEN

01:33:06.814 --> 01:33:08.282
INCREASES PRIMARILY DRIVEN

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:09.817
THROUGH CASELOAD FOR EXAMPLE

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:11.419
FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THIS

01:33:11.485 --> 01:33:12.920
IS BECAUSE THERE BEEN INCREASES

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.255
AND THEIR RATES OF INDIVIDUALS

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:16.724
DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM I AM ALSO

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.192
DDS COSTS HAVE INCREASED IN

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:20.261
RECENT YEARS BECAUSE OF A SHIFT

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.796
AWAY FROM INSTITUTIONALIZATION

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:23.931
AND THROUGH AND TO INDIVIDUAL

01:33:23.998 --> 01:33:27.001
IT- TAILOR TREATMENT- AND CARE

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:29.337
AND SO- THAT'S A BIG REASON FOR

01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:31.405
D. S. AND THEN I JUST US AGAIN.

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:32.807
ARE GROWING SENIOR POPULATION

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:34.809
SO CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE

STATE. DR RIBBONS AS WELL

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:39.313
BECAUSE HE HEARS IT EVERY WEEK

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.750
BUT- YOU KNOW WE COULD WE COULD

01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:45.186
CUT HI HSS- BUT THEN THAT

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:46.587
POPULATION WE HAVE TO GO FIGURE

01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:48.556
OUT HOW TO SERVE THE POPULATION

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:49.123
EITHER IN NURSING HOMES OR

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:51.392
OTHER CHRONIC CARE FACILITIES

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:53.761
THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:57.264
EXPENSIVE THAN IN HOME. SUPPORT

01:33:57.331 --> 01:34:00.501
SERVICES. THAT ACTOR YEAH BUT I

01:34:00.568 --> 01:34:01.736
ALSO ADD THE BECAUSE I JUST IS

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:03.371
A JOINT FEDERAL STATE PROGRAM

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:04.805
THE STATE ACTUALLY HAS QUITE A

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:07.441
LOT OF- LIMITATIONS ON HOW THEY

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:09.977
CAN CUT IHS US IN VARIOUS WAYS.

CALTRANS NUMBER. LOOKS ON-

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:19.186
LARGER. BUT A BIZARRE PRIMARILY

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:20.921
DUE TO THE INCREASE REVENUE

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:22.923
FROM THE GAS TAX AND IT'S THE

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.125
INCREASING CAPITAL COSTS WERE

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:26.060
FINALLY FIXING ROADS THAT WE

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.828
HAVE A FIX FOR DECADES. THAT'S

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:29.897
RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH

BOTTOM THERE THOSE THAT

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:45.980
INCREASE AND IN CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:47.348
THAT YOU SEE OVER THE LAST FEW

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:48.582
YEARS WHICH IS DRIVING THE

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:50.284
INCREASE IN THE ANNUAL AVERAGE

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:52.053
GROWTH FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:54.088
PROGRAMS. IS ON SB ONE REVENUES

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:55.990
THAT ARE BEING USED FOR CAPITAL

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:57.758
OUTLAY PROJECTS BRIAN ALSO

MONEY FOR LOCALS WHICH ALSO

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:02.930
GOES TO CAPITOL. RIGHT OF

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:03.531
COURSE THAT THE BLUE RIDGE TO

01:35:03.597 --> 01:35:06.400

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:08.569
INTENDED LOOKING AT I DON'T

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:09.370
KNOW DOCTOR AND THE TALKED

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:12.573
ABOUT EARLIER CARACAL FIRE

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:13.240
RIGHT OBVIOUSLY TO NUMB THAT IS.

01:35:13.307 --> 01:35:15.443
ON TO CEMEX OUT OF OUR CONTROL

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:16.610
TO THAT'S EXPENDITURES AS BEING

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:20.014
DRIVEN FROM ALL THE WILDFIRES

01:35:20.081 --> 01:35:21.582

SO THERE'S I'M ALSO COSTS

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:33.861
ASSOCIATED WITH. SO I GUESS IN

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:35.096
THE AREAS WHERE WE COULD MAKE A

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:36.564
DIFFERENCE AND HAVE SOME LEVEL

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:37.731
OF SIGNIFICANCE I GUESS WE

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:41.335
COULD DECIDE TO- CUT CSU OR TO

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:44.004
SPEND LESS ON CSU AS WELL AS- A

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:45.573
CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL THAT

THAT'S WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE WE

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:49.110
HAVE. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:35:49.176 --> 01:35:51.545
DISCRETION THAT AREN'T JUST SHE-

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:54.748
FEDERAL PROGRAMS OR SORT OF

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:56.984
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS. YEAH

01:35:57.051 --> 01:35:58.119
PROGRAMS ARE THE LEGISLATURE

01:35:58.185 --> 01:35:59.687
HAS MORE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE

01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:01.388
REDUCTIONS ARE UNIVERSITIES AS

01:36:01.455 --> 01:36:03.624
YOU NOTED CSU UC- EMPLOYEE%

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:04.992
COMPENSATION WHICH IS REALLY

01:36:05.059 --> 01:36:07.027
ARE YOU KNOW IN IN. QUITE ALL

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:09.029

OBVIOUSLY LOT LONG TERM I KNOW

01:36:16.303 --> 01:36:17.771

LONG TERM SAVINGS WITHIN CDC

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:22.643
ARE OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE BEEN

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:24.879
GROWING AT A LOWER RATE THAN

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.313
AVERAGE BUT IT'S STILL A FAIRLY

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.549
LARGE BUBBLE AND WE HOPE WITH

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:29.583
THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:31.285

SOME LEVEL OF FLEXIBLE DELIVERY.

01:36:53.574 --> 01:36:54.842
WELL YOU KNOW I MEAN I DON'T

01:36:54.909 --> 01:36:56.043
DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE THE

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:57.511
LEVEL OF INFLEXIBILITY THAT THE

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:58.946
LEGISLATURE HAS CERTAINLY THERE

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:01.949
ARE OPTIONS- FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:03.417
PROP NINETY EIGHT AREA WHICH IS

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:05.486
THE LARGEST SINGLE GENERAL FUND

01:37:05.553 --> 01:37:07.888
FUNDED PROGRAM- BUT THE

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:10.257
LEGISLATURE CANNOT CHANGE THE

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:11.592
ALLOCATION TO SCHOOLSAND

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.594
COMMUNITY COLLEGES- WITH A TWO

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.429
THIRDS VOTE SO THE FORMULA IS

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:16.730
CONSTITUTIONALLY DRIVING BUT

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:17.898
THE LEGISLATURE CAN SHE CAN

01:37:17.965 --> 01:37:19.166

TWO THIRDS VOTE SO. I DON'T I

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:21.335
DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THE

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:23.070
LEGISLATURE HAS ITS HANDS TIED

01:37:23.137 --> 01:37:24.238
IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:25.472
AREAS EXCEPT FOR THOSE FEW

01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:27.975
HANDFUL BUT OFTEN OBVIOUSLY

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:28.542
THOSE ARE GOING TO INVOLVED

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:29.810
ACCUSED NUMBER OF TRADE OFFS

01:37:29.877 --> 01:37:31.912
AND ALSO- IN SOME CASES LIKE

01:37:31.979 --> 01:37:33.714
WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT WOULD

01:37:33.781 --> 01:37:34.315
INVOLVE MORE THAN A MAJORITY

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:36.383
