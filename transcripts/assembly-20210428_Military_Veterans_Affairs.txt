I THE TWENTY TWO ONE THAT DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT SECTION TWO EIGHT THREE- DIRECT THE MILITARY SERVICES TO INCORPORATE SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE MEASUREMENTS TO INCLUDE. THE EXTENT OF STATE SUPPORT FOR MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT AND LYFT ENTER INTO THEIR FUTURE THE THING DECISION. OKAY DOCTORS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY STATE SPECIFIC LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT CAN CAUSE DELAYS AND GAPS IN EMPLOYMENT. WITH AN ANNUAL CROSS THE RELOCATION RATE TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN THEIR CIVILIAN COUNTERPARTS. BECAUSE MILITARY FINANCE ARE RELATIVELY SHORT.
