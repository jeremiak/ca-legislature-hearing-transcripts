I AM OF THE OPINION AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT. OUR WORK ON THE BUDGET IS AMONGST THE MOST. VALUABLE AND- IMPACTFUL THINGS THAT WE DO HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND IT DESPITE THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING TOGETHER IN PERSON AND TAKING TESTIMONY FROM THE PUBLIC. I THINK IT'S TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE. TO EVETTE THESE TRAILER BILLS BUT THEY MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE IT EVEN THOUGH. SOMETIMES IT CAN BE A CUMBERSOME TO DO THAT THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT SO I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR CONVENING THE HEARING. ALSO OCCURS TO ME THAT THIS COULD BE MY LAST BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING AND SO- IF THAT ENDS UP BEING THE CASE I WANT TO LET YOU ALL KNOW.

APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP- WE EXPECTED YOU TO GOING TO WASHINGTON TO DO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS SO WILL DOUBLE DEFINITION HERE. IN SACRAMENTO SO THANK YOU. BUT OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BUT THAT WE'RE GONNA START WITH L. A. O. OUR FIRST BILL IS SB ONE FIFTEEN THE- AUGUST AMENDMENT TO THE TWENTY TWENTIES BUDGET ACT. GOOD AFTERNOON- MEMBERS MY NAME IS CAROLYN CHIU FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE PRESENT PRESENTING S. B. U. R. ONE FIFTEEN- AND I'LL JUST NOTE UP FRONT THAT WHILE WE WERE INVOLVED IN THE CRAFTING OF. COMPONENTS OF THIS LANGUAGE AND MANY OF THE OTHER TRAILER BILLS OR COMPONENTS WE ARE NOT INVOLVED IN AND MAY HAVE TO DEFERRED THE COMMITTEE AND ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- BUT REGARDING SB ONE ONE FIVE AYE AS THE CHAIR ALREADY NOTED THIS- BILL WOULD AMEND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT AND- LARGELY MAKES OUR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO THAT BUDGET ACT UPDATING FEDERAL FUNDS THAT SORT OF THING- BUT I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE PROVISIONS ARE FOR THE COMMITTEE. I IN PARTICULAR THIS- BUDGET TRAILER EXCUSE ME BUDGET BILL JUNIOR WOULD SPECIFY THE LEGISLATURE'S INVOLVEMENT IN AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL. ON TERMS OF THE LONG TERM CARE AT HOME BENEFIT. NOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE WITHDRAWING THE PROPOSAL FOR THIS BENEFIT AND CONSEQUENTLY BOTH HOUSES- ALSO PLAN TO REMOVE. THIS LANGUAGE FROM THIS PARTICULAR BILL. SB ONE ONE FIVE ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD ALLOW FUNDING FOR- FROM THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM TO PAY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SPOUSE. CHILD AND PARENTS PROVIDERS. IF A POLICY BILL EXTENDING THAT BENEFIT TO THOSE PROVIDERS PASSES. WHAT WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS. BUDGET BILL JUNIOR INCLUDES LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THE PROCESS FOR REDUCING REALIGNMENT- BACKFILL FUNDING FOR COUNTIES IN PARTICULAR IT WOULD PRO RATE- THE REDUCTION IN COUNTY'S BACKFILL FUNDING SHOULD COUNTY IS- BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH STATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS. AND IT ALSO DIRECTS THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK WITH COUNTIES TO BRING THEM BACK INTO COMPLIANCE. WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON LEAST EMERGENCY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE L. A. O. SUMMARIZED- THE BILL I WILL JUST ADD A FEW MORE DETAILS. OF SO ONE ONE FIVE EIGHT SB ONE ON FIVE OF THE MAJORITY OF THESE- AMENDMENTS AND THIS BILL REFLECT TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS AND CONFORMING ADJUSTMENTS TO ITEMS IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY BUDGET ACT. AND THE BUDGET BILL JUNIORS BOTH OF WHICH WERE PASSED IN LATE JUNE JUST AN ADDITIONAL- THINGS TO NOTE THERE ARE A FEW GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS. THERE'S A FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND INCREASE FOR COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH A FOSTER CARE FUNDING. AND THREE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS TO CALTEX AT CAL EXPO TO SUPPORT EXISTING CORE OPERATIONS FROM. SERVICE I GIVEN THE LOSS OF REVENUE AT THAT THEY SUFFERED WITH THE PANDEMIC. ADDITIONALLY. SOME NON GENERAL FUND ADJUSTMENTS TO. THERE ELEVEN POINT EIGHT NINE DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATION FROM THE PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND FOR JUDICIAL COUNCILS PLAN WILLOW'S COURTHOUSE RENOVATION AND ADDITION PROJECT- AND FINALLY AN APPROPRIATION- TECHNICAL APPROPRIATIONS BUT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. IN FEDERAL FUNDED JUSTIN'S FOR VARIOUS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROGRAM. SO WITH ME IN THE ROOM I HAVE OTHER COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WOULD ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND- CAN SPEAK INTO MORE DETAIL OF ANY OF THE ISSUES. THAT ARE BEING COVERED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER REMOTE FROM AT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS BILL INCLUDES AN APPROPRIATION FOR A LITTLE OVER TWO POINT FOUR MILLION-DOLLARS TO THE PART OF JUSTICE TO PAY CLAIMS RELATED TO A COURT CASE WHICH IS BERMAN VERSUS CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY. THAT APPROPRIATION IS BEING MADE. GOOD AFTERNOON. ERIN EDWARDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THAT APPROPRIATION- THE STATE WAS. SUED AND- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ALONG WITH THE- SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. OR BASED ON A CHALLENGE TO PENAL CODE SECTION SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE BEING- WHICH REQUIRES COUNTIES TO PREPARE AND IMPLEMENT BILL SCHEDULES THE STATE WAS DISMISSED OUT OF THE CASE- WITHIN THE YEAR ELEVENTH AMENDMENT. IMMUNITY GROUNDS IT DID NOT WITH TO GET THE CASE DURING THE ENSUING YEARS. HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE STATE WAS DISMISSED OUT OF THE CASE THE DISTRICT COURT ORDERED THE STATE TO PAY FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CASE. AND THE AG'S OFFICE HAS APPEALED THIS ORDER TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT WILL BE BRIEFING WITHIN THE COMING MONTHS- IN THE MEANTIME. THE STATE HAS BEEN ORDERED TO POST BOND. OF ONE POINT TWO FIVE TIMES- THE FEET ORDER OF ONE POINT NINE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. BY OCTOBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THIS IS EQUATES TO THE TWO POINT THREE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS- IN THE BUDGET ACT AMENDMENT THE AG'S OFFICE IS SEEKING DISMISSAL OF THE ORDER. I'M WILL HOPEFULLY GET A DECISION IN THE COMING MONTHS- BUT THE SUCCESS OF THAT MOTION IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME SO- WE ARE SEEKING THIS APPROPRIATION- IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET- JUST IN CASE D. AG IS UNSUCCESSFUL AND THAT PETITION AND THE I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR ALSO. INCLUDES PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THAT THESE FUNDS- IT CAN ONLY BE USEDUPON APPROVAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND NOTIFICATIONS THE LEGISLATURE SO POSTING A BOND. WOULD NOT REQUIRE US TO APPROPRIATE MONEY THAT'S JUST TO GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT IT JUST I'M CONCERNED THAT IT MIGHT BE PREMATURE TO APPROPRIATE THAT MONEY. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE- AWARD IS- IS UNDER APPEAL AND ALSO FRANKLY IN THE LARGER SENSE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS IS A MATTER THAT'S GOING BEFORE THE VOTERS IN THE FORM OF AN INITIATIVE ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER. IT'S CERTAINLY CAN APPRECIATE THE THAT SENTIMENT- I THINK OUR VIEW IS THAT IT'S- IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATIONS SET ASIDE. I GIVEN THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT CASEWILL BE- IT IS- I THINK. IN OUR VIEW- APPROPRIATE- BUDGETING- JUST TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THAT APPROPRIATIONS ALREADY. OUR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE JUST FOR THE PUBLIC FOR INFORMATION WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH ALL SIX BILLS AND THEN TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ALL OF THEM. TOGETHER SO LET'S MOVE ON TO SB EIGHT ONE FIVE THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT AUGUST CLEAN UP. FOR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE PROVISIONS IN SB EIGHT ONE FIVE. SB ONE ONE FIVE WOULD ENACT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT CATS TAX VOUCHER ACT WHICH TASKS THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IN CONSULTATION WITH THE TREASURY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DEVELOP A TAX VOUCHER PROGRAM AND PRESENT THAT PROGRAM PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATURE. NO LATER THAN MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE ACT MAKES CERTAIN ASPECTS OCCASIONS REGARDING THE PROGRAM INCLUDING THAT THESE TAX FACTORS UP COULD BE CREDIT GET COULD BE CREDITED AGAINST A TAXPAYERS FUTURE TAX LIABILITY. BOTH PERSONAL INCOME AS WELL AS A CORPORATE INCOME. TAX ALSO EXCUSE ME THAT THE TAX VOUCHER ACT ALSO SPECIFIES THAT THE COLLECTIONS COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ECONOMIC STIMULUS AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOMELESS REDUCTION WAS NICE REDUCTION EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ECONOMIC MITIGATION PROGRAMS INFRASTRUCTURE. AND GREEN ECONOMY INVESTMENTS. SB EIGHT ONE FOR WOULD ALSO REMAIN RESTRUCTURE THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS. SPECIFICALLY DEBBIE- WOULD BE RENAMED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. THE BILL RESTRUCTURES THE DEPARTMENT IN WAYS THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ITS TWO LICENSING DIVISIONS THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE DIVISION OF CORPORATIONS. IN ADDITION THE LINK IN THE LANGUAGE MERGES THE TWO MAIN FUNDS THAT SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT INTO A SINGLE FUND. IMPORTANTLY THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT IMPLEMENTED THE PROPOSED CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAW. I LASTLY I'LL JUST NOTE THAT- SB EIGHT ONE FIVE ALSO WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPOSIT THE DIRECTOR OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN T- DATA AVAILABLE REGARDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS BEGINNING SEPTEMBER FOURTH AND WOULD REQUIRE THAT DATA TO BE UPDATED EVERY TWO WEEKS THROUGH JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS DATA WOULD INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS PAID SINCE MARCH THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS FOUND IN ELIGIBLE SINCE MARCH THE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE NEVER CERTIFIED FOR BENEFITS AND THE NUMBER OF PAYMENTS WERE NOT PROVIDED WAGE INFORMATION TO QUALIFY FOR CLAIMS. THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS ARE PENDING DEPARTMENT RESOLUTION AND THE NUMBER OF CALLS AND UNIQUE COLORS- THAT- STAFF OF ANSWERED AND IN THAT TWO WEEK PERIOD THE LANGUAGE ALSO SPECIFIES THAT ANY CHANGES OR AMENDMENTS TO THIS DATA I WOULD MAKE WOULD NEED TO BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING TO THE CHAIR OF THE JAIL BC. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC FINANCE NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHRIS COOK WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE L. A. O. DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE MORE NOTABLE- CHANGES IN SB A FIFTEEN THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT TRAILER BILL- SO- WITH THAT I WOULD JUST TURN IT OVER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BY WE I HAVE. JOINED HERE- WITH COLLEAGUES FROM THE PART OF THE FINANCE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE HOUSE. THANK YOU JUST GOT TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS MISTER WHAT. QUESTION FOR THE L. A. L. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROVISION IN THIS TRAILER BILL. THAT EXTENDS THE PERIOD BY WHICH ASSESSMENT APPEAL BOARDS. ARE REQUIRED TO RULE ON TAXPAYER APPEALS OF THEIR PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS. BY UP TO A YEAR I'M WONDERING WHY THAT PROVISION WAS INCLUDED. I'M SORRY WEWOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE INTENT BEHIND THE INCLUSION OF THE PERSON. OKAY PERHAPS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEM. YES CRISCO FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL. ACTUALLY WILL I SHOULD BACK UP SO THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE FOR- CHINESE TO HEAR PROPERTY TAX APPEALS. THAT DATE WAS EXTENDED THROUGH JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD ESSENTIALLY EXTENDED THROUGH MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO IT'S AN ADDITIONAL TWO MONTHS. OKAY I KNOW WHAT IT IS BECAUSE I READ THE BILL. I'M ONE OKAY WHY WHY THAT YOU FEEL THE CHANGES NECESSARY. RIGHT SO. THANK YOU SO- THE CHANGES NECESSARY BECAUSE THE- BECAUSE OF COLD WEATHER THERE'S BEEN SOME- HARDSHIPS ON COUNTIES AND BEING ABLE TO HEAR THESE ARE THESE HEARINGS IN ADEQUATE TIME. AND SO A LOT OF THE HEARINGS THEY WERE UP WITH THE THEY'RE UP AGAINST THEIR TO YOUR CLOCK. THAT CLOCK ENDED IN JULY AND SO- BECAUSE OF THEIR INABILITY TO CONDUCT THE HEARINGS IN A TIMELY MATTER IN HERE THESE APPEALS- FROM- INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS ON THE PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS- THE EXTENSION WAS PROVIDED TO THEM THAT THE COUNTIES TO ALLOW THEM TO- FIND ALTERNATIVE MEANS OR TO GET THROUGH THOSE ARE- THOSE. APPEALS ALL RIGHT- I JUST HAVE A SERIOUS CONCERN THAT. YOU KNOW IN MOST CASES WHEN WE EXTEND THE STATUTORY DEADLINES WE'RE GIVING FLEXIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED US IN THE TAXPAYERS WHO PAY OUR SALARIES. I IN THIS CASE WE'RE DOING THE OPPOSITE WHERE WE'RE GRANTING GOVERNMENT ADDITIONAL POWER AND AUTHORITY- TO- AND TIME TO RULE ON THESE THESE MATTERS WHICH I ACTUALLY THINK THAT MOST OF THESE ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARDS- COULD TRIAGE THEM AND TAKE THE ONES THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WEE MOST LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON OR THEY'RE- REPRESENTED THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF- OF DISPUTE OVER TAXPAYER DOLLARS YOU KNOW IN N HERE THOSE NOW. WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY DO HAVE AND SELF I REALLY OBJECT TO HAVING THAT INCLUDED BECAUSE I THINK- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S KIND OF A- RATHER THAN BEING FLEXIBLE WITH WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS IT'S DOING THE OPPOSITE SO- THAT- MISTER CHAIRMAN THANKS FOR THE ANSWER. THANK YOUNG I WOULD SAY AS A FORMER COUNTY ASSESSOR- YOU KNOW I WAS THE COUNTY ASSESSOR DURING THE LAST GREAT RECESSION. IN JUST TO SET. MATTER OF CONTEXT FOR THE PUBLIC ON THE AMOUNT OF APPEALS THAT WE GOT- DURING THE GREAT RECESSION TO THE PREVIOUS RECESSION WHICH IS AROUND TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND TWO. WAS SEVEN AX SO JUST TO GIVE PEOPLE A SENSE ON. THE PEAK IN APPEALS WAS ABOUT- I THOUSAND APPEALS ROUGHLY- PER YEAR IN THAT PERIOD- WHICH IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE NORMAL. IN AGAIN ON MANY OF THE PEELS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THESE PORTS AT LEAST IN MY COUNTY MY COMES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ARE MOSTLY. THAT COMPLEX PROPERTY SAYS NOT THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IT'S- IT WAS THE EIGHTEEN T. BALLPARK IT'S THE BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING AT THE TRANSAMERICA BUILDING IT'S THE FERRY BUILDING SO ALL VERY VERY COMPLEX. A TOUCH CASES WE WENT UP TO ABOUT- FROM ONE THOUSAND CASES TO ALMOST LIKE SEVEN THOUSAND CASES A YEAR. AND SO THAT TYPE OF- WORKLOAD WE JUST- THERE'S NOT NONE OF THE COUNTIES WERE PREPARED AND GIVEN THAT THIS RECESSION POTENTIALLY IS WORSE. THAN EVEN THAT- GREAT RECESSION- THERE THERE'S A HUGE IMPACT ON THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES- I BELIEVE THERE ARE COUNTIES HOPEFULLY PROVIDING PUBLIC COMMENT- LATER THAN THIS LATER IN THE SEGMENT TO. REALLY GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF- BOTH THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PROPOSAL SO WE EAGERLY AWAIT THAT BUT- A LOT OF IT IS JUST THE HUGE AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD THAT COMES. IN FOR MOST COUNTIES. MOST MOST COUNT KALRA AUTOMATIC. RE ASSESS DOWN SING FAMILY HOMES. BECAUSE IT'S A FOR THESE PROCEDURES IS A SIGNIFICANT OUT OF DATA- IT'S MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TO DO THAT- FOR MORE CONTACT PROPERTIES AS OPPOSED TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LONGER TERM. APPEALS PROCESS BUT THAT THAT'S ALSO WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL TIME FOR. OTHER OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SING AND WE ARE GOING TO GO TO SB EIGHT TWO OF OUR EDUCATION CLEAN UP. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER JOHN MEMBERS ARE GOOD QUALITY WITH FEDERAL OFFICE. SB EIGHT TWENTY OF THE EDUCATIONAL MEDIA TRAILER BILL THERE ARE CHANGES RELATED TO CAN'T FALL. CHILD WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT THREE OF THE- MORE NOTABLE CHANGES. FIRST WAS RELATED TO EIGHTY EIGHT GROWTH. SO BUT THE DESIGN. THIS BILL PROVIDE. ACROSS FOR. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO- RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING BASED ON OUR GROWTH IN ATTENDANCE. AS YOU MAY RECALL THAT YOU MAY NOT THE BUDGET- STEPPED UP FUNDING LEVEL BASED ON ATTENDANCE FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. THE LIST OF THESE PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW BUT SCHOOL DISTRICT TORRANCE COURT COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. TO APPLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL GROWTH FUNDING. AND THE PERSONAL GROWTH FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED. IF THE IF THEY WOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE OUR TWO THINGS FIRST THAT. THERE WAS A PROJECTED ENROLLMENT GROWTH- YEAH YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT COULD YOU BUDGET OR IN OUR- PREVIOUS IN OUR ESTIMATES IN THE SPRING. CHIU AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS THAT THE DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE WOULD BE- ACTUAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH. A GROWTH BASED ON. A FALSE SENSE AT THE MOMENT. I'M THE AND A MAJOR I WOULD HIGHLIGHT A AN APPROPRIATE OF EIGHTY DOLLAR IN NINETY FUND. RELATED TO CHINA. THIS IS A ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ENHANCED. REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR MEALS WERE PROVIDED BETWEEN- MARCH AND AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY- BUT BUT YOU'RE NOT THE BUDGET ALREADY INCLUDED A HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE UP TO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS PER MEAL. I WAS PROVIDED DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING JUST- PROVIDE GREATER ASSURANCES THAT THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND OUT SEVENTY FIVE CENTS PER. ORDINARY AND THEN FINALLY RID CHILD KERR THERE IS A- CHANGE TO FAMILY FEES. SO YOU MAY RECALL THAT THERE ARE SOME SMALL- SLIDING SCALE FEES. FOR OUR FAMILIES THAT RECEIVE SUBSIDIES CHAPARRAL PRESCHOOL- BUT THE BILL SB EIGHT TWENTY- WEAVE THOSE FEES RETROACTIVELY FOR JULY AND AUGUST. AND PROVIDE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS- REPORTER FOR THAT PURPOSE- THE- THEN FROM SEPTEMBER THROUGH JUNE- FEES WOULD BE WAIVED FOR ANY FAMILIES WHO WERE- WELL I'M NOT ABLE TO OR NOT PARTICIPATING OR NOT BE ABLE TO SEND THEIR CHILD ON FLIGHT SO. IN SOME CASES- CONTRACT PROVIDED TO THE STATE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SOME DISTANCE LEARNING OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE FOR PRESCHOOL STUDENTS. BOTH FAMILIES WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO BE USED- TO THE EXTENT- THAT- THERE ARE NOT FEES ARE NOT COLLECTED DURING THAT PERIOD PROVIDERS- WOULD BE THE ONES THAT WOULD ABSORB THE COST. I'M UNLESS THERE'S ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE INACTIVE BUDGET HAVE A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS THAT SPECIFY IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING FOR TALKS AT. AN EARLY LEARNING HOW THOSE FUNDS SHOULD BE SPENT. SB EIGHT TWENTY- STARTS COVERING BECAUSE APPARENTLY HE'S ABOUT FIRST PRIORITY WITH ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE- THOSE ARE THE THREE MAJOR ON. THE HIGH LIFE AND IT ON CERTAIN QUESTIONS ABOUT. THANK YOU GOOD FINANCE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND THIS IS JUST HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- MR CABRAL DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN I'M GIVING AN OVERVIEW OF THE SB TWENTY I WOULD JUST ADD A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL PIECES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BILL THE BILL DOES- CLARIFY ALLOWABLE USES AND EXTEND THE EXPENDITURE PERIOD FOR SOME OF THE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION IN LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION FUNDS. THAT WERE APPROPRIATED IN SB EIGHTY NINE- IN ADDITION THE BILL INCREASES THE NUMBER OF PAID OFF NON OPERATIONAL DAYS FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THAT ACCEPT STATE VOUCHERS- AND FINALLY THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES GREATER DETAIL ON THE MISSION AND COMPOSITION OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S TASK FORCE. I'M I'M ALSO HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE- CHRIS. HIGHER EDUCATION. SURE HERTZBERG SOME OF THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SB ONE TWENTY OR SB EIGHT TWENTY ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION FRONT ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONS TO ADD THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES EXTENDS THE DEADLINE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT A POLICY IMPLEMENTING THE NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION ACT OUR PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT THAT IS- IT ALLOWS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO UTILIZE THE SAVINGS FROM CERTAIN- BOND REFINANCINGS. FOR A BOWL OR FOR THREE THINGS- AT THAT WOULD BE A IT'S UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY- POTENTIALLY AVOIDING ANY LAYOFFS THAT COULD OTHERWISE. OCCUR AND TO SUPPORT OUR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS- AND THEN LASTLY- THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE STATE LIBRARY TO BE ABLE TO. RECEIVE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY RATHER THAN IN PHYSICAL PRINT FORM. THANK YOU I ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MR FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THAT'S A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- HERE FOR VARIOUS REASONS BUT ESPECIALLY DURING THIS THIS PANDEMIC A LOT OF. PARENTS ARE CHOOSING TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO. NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS WHY IN THIS- TRAILER BILL ARE. THE FUND IS THE FUNDING PROHIBITED TO GO TO STUDENTS THAT ATTEND NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS. YES THIS IS JESSICA HOLMES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE THOUGHT BEHIND- THE NON INCLUSION OF NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS AND EIGHTY A GROWTH WAS TO ALIGN WITH THE POLICY DECISION THAT WAS MADE IN EIGHTY FIFTEEN OH FIVE- THAT WAS. JUST RECENTLY PASSED WHICH PUT A MORATORIUM ON GROWTH FOR NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SO THIS IS AN ALIGNMENT- WITHIN THAT POLICY AGREEMENTS. BUT AS THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZE THAT NOW DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT THERE IS GROWTH OR THERE IS INCREASED DEMAND NOW FOR NON BUT QUESTION BAY STARTERS DON'T WE SHOULDN'T WE ADJUST FOR THE REALITY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. WE CERTAINLY I RECOGNIZE THAT SOME FAMILIES MAY- MAY BE WISHING TO UTILIZE A DIFFERENT- ALLEVIATE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY I'M OTHER THAN WHAT THEY WERE CURRENTLY IN DURING THE PANDEMIC- THAT IS TRUE BOTH ON THE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SIDE THE CLASS- SIDE. AND THE LOCAL AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SIDE- DEPENDING UPON YOU KNOW WHAT- WHAT SERVICES THEY'RE LOOKING FOR OR IF IT WAS TO MOVE- DUE TO COOK AT NINETEEN OR THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING- RECOGNIZING ALL OF THESE THINGS AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE PREVENT. REQUIRING LGAS TO TAKE ON- ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AND DEFERRALS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE PROVIDE A HOLD HARMLESS FOR TWENTY TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR. AS WELL AS FUNDING EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIALLY EXTRAORDINARY GROWTH- OR MOVEMENTS I SHOULD SAY BETWEEN ELEAZAR- DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT WOULD HAVE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRALS THAT WE HAVE- IN THE CURRENT YEAR SOWE BELIEVE THAT THAT. THE PROPOSAL THAT'S IN E. S. B. TWENTY- IS A GOOD COMPROMISE- IN TERMS OF PROVIDING- SOME EIGHTY EIGHT FUNDING FOR EIGHTY A GROWTH THAT WAS PLANNED- BUT NOT NECESSARILY EXPOSING THE STATE TO THE FISCAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTENTIAL- SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT. AMONG ELEAZAR DURING THE NINETEEN. SUGGESTS THAT TO BE CLEAR THEN THE ADMINISTRATION ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE IS SOME TYPE OF AN INEQUITY WHEN IT COMES TO. FUNDING NOW WHEN IT COMES TO VERT WHEN YOU COMPARE NON CUSTOM PAID CHARTER SCHOOLS TO THE REST OF. THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE. I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT THAT WAY I WOULD SAY THAT- CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE ALSO BEEN ELIGIBLE TO DRIVE DOWN. I'M FUNDING SOURCES SUCH AS A FEDERAL PAYMENT PROTECTION PROGRAM FUNDS- THAT OTHER LEDS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS SO- THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT- THERE MANY DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES THAT DIFFERENT ELITES CAN ACCESS AND- YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT A SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE OR CHARTER SCHOOL IS BETTER OFF. UNDER ONE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE OTHER IT'S REALLY GONNA BE DEPENDING UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDIVIDUAL L. YAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR ANSWER YOUR CANDOR I JUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS ROOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THERE'S A PROVISION- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN YOUR- I REMARKS BUT IN THE WRITTEN MATERIALS THAT REQUIRES THE- THE UC TO CERTIFY. TO THE DLF ANNUALLY THAT THE BUILDINGS BUILT THROUGH STATE FUNDED CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS ARE BEING OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY YOU SEE EMPLOYEES- IS THAT A PROVISION RELATING TO- ESSENTIALLY CERTIFYING THAT THERE'S NO CONTRACTING OUT. AND IF SO CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN THE THINKING BEHIND THAT. SO CERTAINLY- I GUESS I CAN- PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT THIS IS A NO A LEGISLATIVE UP LANGUAGE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THAT THAT IS IN THE YOU HAVE TRAILER BILL- THE INTENT OF THAT LANGUAGE IS TO. ESTABLISH WHAT THEY CALL IN FORCING WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH- THE RECENTLY ADOPTED AND SIGNED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT- WITH SOME OF ITS SITE WITH YOU SEE AND IT SERVICE WORKERS- WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT. UP FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES PER WE'RE NOT A POSITION TO SOME THAT LINE TODAY BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS IN THE TRAILER BILL. OKAY THANK YOU AND THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS RIGHT NOW IT'S A TWO PARTY AGREEMENT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE. WAS SOME TUSSLING BACK AND FORTH OVER OVER THIS PROVISION IT DOES STRIKE ME AS- BEING A LITTLE BIT UNUSUAL THAT. SOMETHING THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS NOW BEING. ADDING A REQUIREMENT IN TRAILER BILL I. FOR CERTIFICATION I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT WOULDN'T. JUST BE COVERED BY THE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT AND NOT NEED TO OUR INTERVENTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER. IT'S AWFUL BY. THEY'LL STAND TO LOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN FUNDING THE CONDUCTOR LOTTERIES IN REAL STUDENTS FOR NEXT YEAR I MEAN HARD HIRING DECISIONS ACCORDINGLY THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS THEY HAVE EITHER DESYREL STUDENTS AS ALLOWABLE UNDER PROPOSAL FOR EDUCATE NEWSROOMS WITHOUT FUNDING. JUST HAS JUST DON'T AGREE WITH THAT STILL SO WHY NOT IMPOSE A CAP ON HOW MUCH NOT CLASSROOM BASED GOALS CAN BE FUNDED RESIDENT OUT RIGHT EXCLUSION OF GROW FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOLS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M FOR THE QUESTION SO AGAIN- THIS LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO BE IN ALIGNMENT- WITH AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE WHICH AGAIN- IMPOSED A MORATORIUM ON A CLUSTER BASED CHARTERS- FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR. BUT BUT FIFTEEN OH FIVE WAS FOR NEW NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER'S NOT ENROLLMENT AND GROWTH EXISTING SCHOOLS CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT. THANK YOU. IN THIS REGARD. THANK YOU YOU KNOW. I'LL TALK ABOUT THE UC THING BUT THIS THIS THIS FIRST ISSUE AS FAR AS THE- NON CLASSROOM BASED GROWTH AND THIS WAS A BIG ISSUE IN THE JUNE BUDGET AND I THINK JUST JUST I THINK IT'S AND MISS. EGGMAN DISTRICT MISTER COOPER NOT YOURS BUT JUST MAYBE SOUTH OF YOURS IS. A COMMUNITY THAT'S GOT A BIG DEVELOPMENT FROM BURY PEOPLE COMING OVER AND- THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE POPULATION OR SCHOOL DISTRICT IS GOING FROM LIKE THREE THOUSAND TO SOME LIKE SIX THOUSAND MEALS NUMBERS ARE CORRECT. IN THE NEXT YEAR AND WHEN 95% OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASKED US YOU KNOW COBIT NINETEEN IS HAPPENING THE SKY IS FALLING. JUST HOLD HARMLESS CAPPER EDA WE ARE WHERE WE ARE TODAY INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SAME ISSUE PEOPLE ARE COMING TO SCHOOL THEY'RE STAYING HOME SOMEONE A CAP. EIGHTY EIGHT SO WE MADE THE TOUGH CHOICES FARMS OKAY WE'RE GONNA CAP WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GONNA FREEZE IT FREEZE YOUR FUNDING IT TO DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND SO YOU HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE. IT WASN'T TO HAVE SOME PLOY TO HARM THESE OTHER ENTITIES THAT'S WHERE WE WORK WHERE WE WORK LAST MARCH APRIL AND MAY. WE ADOPTED THE BUDGET IN JUNE. AND WE KNOW THAT ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE FRANKLY DISTANCE LEARNING INCLUDING THESE THESE THESE CHARTERS BUT- 95% OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHAT ARE AND ARE IN DEEP DEEP TROUBLE AND- WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND I THINK WE FIX THE BIGGEST ISSUE HERE WITH THIS WITH THIS PLAN GROWTH- AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S A FAIR COMPROMISE. IT HOLDS- THAT THE DISTRICTS- HARMLESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE IN GREAT FINANCIAL PERIL. AS NOTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SOME OF THESE- ENTITIES THAT ARE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS. THERE IS A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO THEY RECEIVE THESE MAJOR PPO AWARDS THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE AVAILABLE TO GET TO SO THAT'S- NOT INTO CONSIDERATION HERE SO I DON'T THINK IT'S- NECESSARILY A PUNITIVE. PEACE GOING AFTER ONE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON- YOU KNOW THAT THE LARGER. PICTURE AS FAR AS HOLDING OUR OUR SCHOOLS. AND IN A VIABLE PLACE TO GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC- WITH THAT I THINK THAT IT WAS A FAIR COMPROMISE. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OUTLINED IT. AS WELL- I JUST I DO WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE UC THING- I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S NOT A THREE PARTY AGREEMENT AND SO CERTAINLY THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS THE RIGHT TO BLUE PENCIL THIS AT THE END- BUT IT I GUESS I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. IS THIS JUST A- FURTHERANCE OF OUR OF OUR PRIOR ACTIONS AS FAR AS- CONTRACTING OUT THE NEAREST TO CALIFORNIA OR JUST A NEW. IS THERE ISTHIS A NEW- KIND OF OBLIGATION ON TOP OF THAT. OKAY SO THE PROCESS THE WOULD BE ESTABLISHED- IN THE TRAILER BILL IT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND- WHAT IS CURRENT LAW AND THE CURRENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT- BETWEEN- YOU SEE AND THEIR PARTNERS. YEAH. GOTCHA SO THIS PROBABLY QUIT WENT TO WHAT WAS IN HAD IT BEEN- HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATURE PUT ON THE BALLOT WAS THE CA FOURTEEN THAT RIGHT. I THINK THEY'RE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- THE LANGUAGE CERTAINLY AN ACA FOURTEEN VERSES THAT THE LANGUAGE IN SB EIGHT TWENTY ARE VERY DIFFERENT. OKAY. AND THEN LASTLY I'M SORRY I DID HAVE A NOTE HERE WANT TO GO BACK TO THE K. TWELVE CAN YOU CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION BECAUSE SOME OF THESE I KNOW WE HAD THIS FIFTEEN OF FIVE AND THE BOOK OF THE LAW ON THE GROWTH FROM NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS BUT IF THERE ARE EXISTING- NON CLASSROOM BASED TRADERS AND THERE AND THERE HAD BEEN PLANNED GROWTH THAT PLANNED GROWTH. IS FUNDED IT'S JUST THE GROWTH THAT'S NOT IN RESPONSE TO COVET GROWTH POTENTIALLY THAT ACCURATE THE LANGUAGE IN SB EIGHT TWENTY- DOES NOT ALLOW NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS TO RECEIVE FUNDING FOR- ANY TYPE OF GROWTH- ABOVE THE NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHTY EIGHT LEVEL. CORRECT WE ARE ALLOWING FOR PLANNED GROWTH FOR. CHARTERS FIRST CLASS FOR CLASS CLASSROOM BASED TRAINING LASTING BASIS PLANNED GROWTH. YES CORRECT OKAY WANNA CLARIFY THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MMHM. MISTER MONTE. I ALSO HAD A QUESTION ON THAT THE- CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER ISSUE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. AS WE ALL KNOW THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAS BEEN IN DISAGREEMENT ABOUT. WHAT FORM. ADDITIONAL AID TO STATES IS GOING TO TAKE AS A RESULT OF THE CROSSFIRE CHRIS CRISIS AND THEIR BILLS PENDING IN BOTH CHAMBERS BUT THE BILL THAT'S PENDING IN THE SENATE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES STATES NOT TO PENALIZE CHARTER SCHOOLS IN RESPECT TO TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS. AT THE RISK OF LOSING THAT FEDERAL AID SO DO DO YOU WORRY THAT SHOULD THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL PASSED THEN- CALIFORNIA WILL YOU WILL LOSE THAT FUNDING IF THAT BILL BECOMES LAW. THANK YOU I CAN'T REALLY COMMENT ON- PENDING LEGISLATION HOWEVER- I WOULD NOTE THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING- WHAT. IS HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL VERY CLOSELY- FOR NUMBER OBVIOUSLY OF REASONS- AND AT THIS POINT WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE IN THE POSITION THAT RAT. WELL I DON'T. AND I THINK A NUMBER OF US DON'T. AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A LONG TRADITION IN THE STATE OF. ALLOWING FUNDING TO FOLLOW THE STUDENT. AND WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE CHOOSING NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS TO WHETHER THIS CRISIS- I FULLY SUPPORT THE DECISION. TO COMPENSATE OUR TRADITIONAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR LOSS OF ENROLLMENT THAT'S- THAT'S- OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE- THE EPIDEMIC I THINK THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND WE DID TO MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE READY WILLING AND ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS WHEN THEY COME BACK INTO TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS- SETTINGS BUT- BUT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE TO ME. TO REFUSE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR- THE SETTINGS THAT THESE PARENTS ARE CHOOSING TO SEND THEIR THEIR STUDENTS INTO SO I RE I'M REALLY HOPING THAT. SURE THIS MOVE FOR THAT- WE RECONSIDER THAT PORTION OF IT AND- NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS BECAUSE I THINK IT PUTS A SERIOUSLY IN DANGER. OF LOSING OUT ON THOSE FEDERALLY DOLLARS. I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE UC ISSUE I'M IN A KIND OF STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS. WHY THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT A QUESTION FOR THE L. A. JUST TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. SO IF WE IF WE HAVE TO GIVE YOU A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE FROM MY LOCAL YOU SEE. IF WE'VE GOT SOME BUILDINGS. WITH ELEVATORS AND THEM. AND THOSE ELEVATORS NEED TO BE PERIODICALLY MAINTAINED DOES THAT MEAN THAT. THE SCHOOL HAS TO EMPLOY. A FOR A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE JUST TO DO A LOT FOR ELEVATOR MAINTENANCE. THE END AND THEY GET THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CONTRACT OUT THAT- THAT LABOR. EVEN THOUGH THERE'S ENOUGH FULL TIME WORK FOR- FOR AN ELEVATOR MAINTENANCE REPAIRMAN IS THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT RIGHT. THIS IS JENNIFER. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO AND WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO ANALYZE THE BILL BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF IT IS- I CAN SEE WHAT YOU SUGGEST. SO JUST FOR AT WE THINK WHAT THIS PROVISION YOU DOES IS PROHIBIT SEE CONTRACTING OUT FOR CERTAIN SUPPORT SERVICES THEY MIGHT NOT NEED TO HIRE AT A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE TO DO THAT JOB BUT THEY WOULD NEED TO BE A UC EMPLOYEE. TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE AS FINANCE MENTIONED IT'S DIFFERENT FROM A CA FOURTEEN WHICH SAID THAT YOU SEE IF IT CONTRACTS OUT MUST TREAT THAT CONTRACTED OUT EMPLOYEE THE SAME AS THEY WOULD A YOU SEE EMPLOYEE. SO WE DO KNOW FROM SOME VERY PRELIMINARY INFORMATION THAT WE GOT THAT ARE YOU SEEN EMPLOYEE ON AVERAGE JUST MAKE MORE THAN ONE ENTERED PLAY WHICH TYPICALLY BE PAID FULL SALARY AND WAIT BENEFITS. FOR YOU SEE CONTRACTING OUT. FOR THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE. AND THESE ARE TWO DECISION BEFORE YOU WHETHER YOU WANT TO DO THIS IS PART OF YOUR BUT PROCESS. AS PART OF FOR. IS PART OF A COLLECTIVE. PROCESS THOSE OBVIOUSLY ARE KEY DECISIONS BEFORE YOU RIGHT WELL I MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS WHY. IN THE MIDST OF A RECESSION IN A PANDEMIC WE WOULD CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS INCREASING COSTS FOR. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE UC IS I MEAN WE ALL KNOW. THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE THE BEST. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THEY CAN FOR THE DOLLARS THAT WE GIVE THEM AND IF THEY CONTRACT OUT MADE IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO BE COST EFFICIENT WITH THEIR DOLLARS. YEAH AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WELL MY LOCAL YOU SEE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVES THAT THAT'S WORK CORPORATE PART OF THE LAW REQUIRES THEM TO DO IN FACT. THERE'S A CURRENT POLICY THAT REQUIRES THIS IS NOT STATURE IT- AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FORCED TO DO IS TO HIRE SOMEONE FULL TIME WITH A SPECIALIZED TRAINING TO DO ELEVATOR MAINTENANCE EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE FULL TIME WORK. FOR AN ELEVATOR MAINTENANCE REPAIR REPAIRMAN AND- THAT THAT'S RIDICULOUS SO- I WOULD I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE. TO RECONSIDER THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU I TO WHAT I WANT TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO THOSE OF YOU. IT SAYS HERE IN OUR BUDGET THAT WE HAVE SET A MINIMUM- DAYS OF INSTRUCTION AND A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF- MINUTES I GUESS FOR INSTRUCTION. OF DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE I SEE WE HEAR WHAT WE'RE ALLOWING OF COURSE IS ABOUT A FOUR DAYS. SCHOOL WEEK IF THEY CHOOSE- AND- BUT IT ALSO SAYS THAT WE'VE CREATED A MINIMUM STANDARD OF DESTRUCTION OF DAY IN THE MINUTES REQUIREMENTS WHAT IS WHAT IS THE MINIMUM. STANDARD THAT WE'RE PUTTING TO FORCE RIGHT NOW IN THE IN THE OBVIOUSLY. OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. YES CERTAINLY DOCTOR WELL. AND SO THE SB EIGHTY NINE I'M AT YOURCORRECT IT MAINTAINS OUR MINIMUM DAILY MINUTES- AS WELL AS THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS BUT PROVIDES- SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ON- TOTAL ANNUAL MINUTES- BE GOOD AND NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS FOR NON CHARTER LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DAYS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS- THE MINIMUM DAILY MINUTES. IS REALLY DEPENDENT UPON AND THE GRADE LEVEL OF THE CHILD BUT IT RANGES FROM ABOUT THREE AND A HALF HOURS- FOR THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN- TO MORE THAN. I HAVE. I THINK IT'S FOUR AND A HALF HOURS FOR THE OLDER CHILDREN- I I'LL GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE ON THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OFF ON ON THIS- HOWEVER AND S. B. AT EIGHT TWENTY. DOES PROVIDE IT DOES INCLUDE SOME LANGUAGE THAT IS SPECIFIC TO SCHOOL. A FEW SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO- HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN APPROVED FOR FOUR DAY SCHOOL WEEKS- AND SO THE LANGUAGE IN SB TWENTY THAT'S REGARDING- AT THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AS SPECIFIES FEWER REQUIRED DAYS- BECAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS AT THAT APPROVAL FOR A FOUR DAY SCHOOL. SO OKAY IN ADDITION SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT. THAT THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF- BASICALLY FOUR AND A HALF HOURS A DAY IS WHAT WE CONSIDER THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE'RE GOING FOR FIRST FOR ALL THE- FOR A FULL SCHOOL DAY IS FOUR AND A HALF HOURS IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YEAH IT IT RANGES DEPENDING ON- THE GREAT AND AGAIN I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE ON THAT EXACT NUMBER FOR LIKE HIGH SCHOOL IT'S HIGHER FOR HIGH SCHOOL- BUT IT'S- IT RANGES FROM LIKE I SAID ABOUT THREE AND A HALF HOURS FOR- KINDERGARTEN- UP. AS YOU GO THROUGH THE GREAT AND WE'RE JESTING THAT YOU SAYING THAT'S CHANGING. NO THAT'S THAT IS BEING MAINTAINED IT'S THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MINUTES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR. THAT WE'VE PROVIDED FLEXIBILITY BUT THAT THE REQUIREMENT ON MINIMUM DAYS. I'VE BEEN ON DALY MINUTES IS THE SAME AS IT WAS CREE COVE IT AS WELL AS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR NUMBER OF DAYSIN A YEAR. AND SO THE ADJUSTMENT WOULD OCCUR BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS DECIDED TO FOUR DAYS INSTEAD OF FIVE IS THAT CORRECT. YES THE LANGUAGE IN SPM EIGHT TWENTY IS VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF I BELIEVE IT'S THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AT WHO HAD. WHO HAD PRIOR TO CO THAT ALREADY BEEN APPROVED FOR FOUR DAY SCHOOL WEEKS BECAUSE THEY ARE AN EXTREMELY RURAL- AND SO THIS THAT THE BILL JUST SPECIFIES THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT. L. ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE A MINIMUM A NUMBER OF SCHOOL DAYS THAT SIMILAR TO OTHER SCHOOLS PARTICLE BUT THAT THAT CONTINUES DURING CODE. OKAY AND SO IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE OTHER SCHOOLDISTRICTS SO AT ALL NO IT DOES NOT IT DOES NOT GOOD TO KNOW- I TO- HAVE CONCERNS OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SEPARATED OUT. OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE I CONSIDER CHARTER SCHOOLS PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THEY ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH THE FUNDED BY PUBLIC DOLLARS. SO BUT WE SEPARATED THEM OUT THE TYPICALLY THOSE THAT ARE- OF WHO DO A DISTANCE LEARNING- WHO DON'T HAVE PHYSICAL CLASSROOMS- A NON BASED CLASSROOM CHARTER SCHOOLS WE'VE SEPARATED THEM OUT. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE THOSE IN THE STATE BUT IT'S QUITE A FEW. I KNOW I HAVE ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE IN MY DISTRICT- THAT WILL PROBABLY- YOU KNOW FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITION TO BE THE RIDGE- AFTER HAVING ACCEPTED KIDS. PUTTING KIDS OUT OR- OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF FUNDING. THIS MAY BE THE FIRST TIME CALIFORNIA HAS NOT FUNDED ITS CHILDREN IN OTHER WORDS EVERY JOB THAT COMES IN THE DOOR GET STATE FUNDING- AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. THE SCHOOLS FUND BUT NOT AT THE LEVEL OF THE STUDENTS OUT OF THE YEAR- AND THEN OTHER THIS OTHER SCHOOLS WHO MADE. MY EXPERIENCE THE CLASS- ONCE THEY GET TO SINCE HIS DATE. OF WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE WE WOULD BE FUNDING SCHOOLS CHILDREN THAT DON'T EXIST IN THE CLASSROOM SO. I MEAN THAT THAT I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR A CHARTER SCHOOLS TO. TO TAKE. BECAUSE WE SEPARATED THEM OUT IN TERMS OF FUNDING. AND GROWTH WHICH IS THE MOST UNFORTUNATE FOR THEM- AND MOST UNFORTUNATE FOR FAMILIES BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PARENTS AS THE- HAVE MADE CHOICES. ABOUT WHERE THEY WANT THE KIDS TO GO SOMETIMES BASED ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS PAST YEAR THEY WANT. AND THEY WANT TO IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO SOME DISTANCE LEARNING THAT WE WANT A DIFFERENT. STRUCTURE FOR DISTANCE LEARNING OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE SO. IT SEEMS RATHER- SAY PUNITIVE BUT IT SEEMS SOMEWHAT PRIMITIVE THAT. THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE NOT BEING ADEQUATELY FUNDED- AS WE FUND EVERYBODY ELSE. M. AND WE SEPARATED DID NOT CLASSROOM. BUT WE HAVE A SEPARATED NINE CLASS. IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SETTING. BECAUSE THEY WILL PROBABLY A LOTS OF NON CLASSROOMS OF SCHOOLS. OUT THERE BE OPENING NEXT WEEK. AND I THINK THIS AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE FUNDING- AT AT AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL IN TERMS OF STUDENTS BUT WE'VE CHOSEN TO. BASICALLY NOT ALLOW THOSE OTHERS TO BE FUNDED THIS IS AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION. AS SOON AS CONVERSATION OCCURRED IN SOME BUDGET HEARING SOMEWHERE. OF THAT OF. THAT OBVIOUSLY I WASN'T PART OF BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THAT COMMITTEE BUT NONETHELESS. IT AFFECTS ALL OF US INTO THE AFFECT OUR MEMBERS AS WELL AS THEY GO BACK TO TRY TO EXPLAIN TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. BY CERTAIN SCHOOLS ARE NOT BEING ADEQUATELY FUNDED. SO I'M NOT SURE. HOW THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE I SHOULD KNOW BUT I DON'T. IN SOME ROOM SOMEWHERE- WE'RE OBVIOUSLY MEMBERS AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL MEMBERS ASKED ME ABOUT THE NOT THE FUNDING OF NINE CLASSROOMS IN THIS NEW PROPOSAL THEY WERE UPSET OVER THE FIRST RIPPLES OF SO WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN TERMS OF. A DEAL WITH A BRICK AND MORTAR KIND OF SET UP SITUATION WHAT THE NEEDS ARE EQUALLY GREAT AND I THINK AS AS A STATE WE RECOGNIZE AND SOMETIMES WE THINK THAT DISTANCE LEARNING IS. IS NOT AS RIGOROUS AND THAT IS SIGNIFICANT BUT I THINK WE PROBABLY LEARNED THAT IN THE LAST. FOR THREE FOUR MONTHS AS WE HAVE ENGAGED IN DISTANCE LEARNING THAT TO DO IT AND TO DO IT RIGHT IS IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND ALLOW STAFF TIME. A LOT OF RESOURCES AND YET WE'RE CUTTING OFF THE RESOURCES TO A METHOD OF ALL INSTRUCTION THAT WE AS A STATE HAVE EMBRACED OUT OF NECESSITY. AT THIS POINT AND PROBABLY WILL HAVE MORE OF OUR KIDS NOT IN THE CLASSROOM AND IN THE CLASSROOM TIS YEAR AND IT WOULD NOT FUNDING TO TRY TO SCHOOLS. WHO ARE DOING THIS HARD WORK- I THINK AS A AS A COMMITTEE WE SHOULD RETHINK THIS PROPOSAL THAT'S COMING TO US NOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA. COULD NOT FUND THE SCHOOLS. IN CALIFORNIA ALWAYS FINDS ITS KIDS EVEN IF IT EVERYBODY GETS A MORE OUT THEY GET THAT THEY GET THE FUNDING THEY KNOW WHAT IT IS. SO. THANK YOU DON'T WANT WITH ANY OTHER COMMENTS. FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE SIR NONE LET'S GO TO SB. EIGHT THREE. GOOD AFTERNOON LIQUOR SMART WITH THE LIST OF AN OFFICE ARE YOU ABLE TO HELP ME. YOUR YES WE CAN HEAR YOU I'LL BE PRESENTING SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE WERE AGREED LINE THAT OF JUVENILE FROM THE STATE TO THE COUNTY UNDER SB EIGHT TO THREE D. A. J. WERE STOP INTAKE BEGINNING JULY TO TWENTIETH. AND THE A FINAL DATE OF THIS THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE ANY USE REMAINING AND DJ AS OF THAT DATE WOULD BE. WE TALKED TO THE COUNTIES OF JURISDICTION THREE YOU COULD BE HOUSING THE EXISTING TYPES OF. COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES INCLUDING GYM OUT HOMES RANCHES IN CAMPS AS WELL AS A NEW TYPE OF FACILITY SECURE YOU TREATMENT FACILITIES. WHICH WOULD BE A TOP AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS BILL AND WOULD BE INTENDED TO CREATE A NEW TYPE OF. FACILITY FOR THAT WOULD PROVIDE PROGRAMMING AND TREATMENT TO USE EDUCATED FOR VIOLENT OR SERIOUS OFFENSES. THAT BILL WOULD ALSO PROVIDES. OF MAKE CHANGES TO DISCARD THE PLACEMENT OF YOUTH AND ADULT FACILITIES- CALL ME WHEN YOU USE CASES TRANSFERRED FROM THE JUVENILE COURT TO A CRIMINAL COURT AND IN THE U. THE SENTENCED TO PRISON. DJJ WOULD HOUSE THAT YOU'VE UNTIL THEY ARE RELEASED AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION CDCR. UNDER SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE WHEN DID I STOP INTAKE COUNTIES WOULD HOUSE ANY YOUTH. WHO WERE SENTENCED TO PRISON UNTIL THEY ARE EIGHTEEN AND THEN WHEN THEY ARE EIGHTEEN THEY'LL BE TRANSFERRED T CDC ARE AND WE NEED TO PAY THE CDC OURS MARGINAL COST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SENTENCE. WE KNOW THAT CURRENTLY COUNTIES DO NOT PAY A FEE FOR YOU SENT TO PRISON BUT THEY DO PAY A FEE FOR YOUTH COMMITTED TO DJJ. THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THIS REALIGNMENT. THROUGHOUT THE BLOCK GRANT. A ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT. AND A REGIONAL COMPETITIVE GRANT. IN ORDER TO ACCESS THESE GRANT FUNDS COUNTY WOULD NEED TO FOLLOW CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. INCLUDING SUBMITTING PLANS TO THE STATE FOR APPROVAL ON HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE UTILIZED. SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE WOULD ALSO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU CAN YOU MAY WANT ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE OFFICE OF YOUTH JUSTICE WOULD BE CREATED UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE TASKS. SUCH AS REGULATORY OVERSIGHT DATA COLLECTION AND ALL JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ESCC. WE KNOW THAT HAVING CONCERNS RAISED IN THE PAST ABOUT THE SEC'S ABILITY DEPRIVE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT JJ CPA WAS HINDERED BY INADEQUATE AND OUTDATED PLANS. WHICH COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO THE SEC ANNUALLY THAT LIMITED OVERSIGHT BY THE SEC CONTRIBUTED TO THIS. PHYSICALLY THE AUDITOR NOTED THAT THE SEC LOCKED THE THIRTY TO. COMPEL COUNTIES TO COMPLY WITH THE JJC% REQUIREMENTS IN ADDITION PSEC TO NOT REVIEW THE PLANS COUNTY SUBMITTED FOR ACCURACY. OR REQUIRE THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE DETAILS ON ANY CHANGES THEY MADE TO THE PLANS. OTHER ENTITIES HAVE ALSO BEEN RATE HAVE ALSO RAISED CONCERNS REGARDING THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT PROVIDED BY PSPC INCLUDING JOURNALISTS AND THE PRISON LAW OFFICE. THANK YOU I HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU TO PROPONENTS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE APPRECIATE ALL THE DISCUSSION AND HARD WORK THAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS PROPOSAL I'M FOR. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH- SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE AND THAT BOTH FISCAL AND POLICY- AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANKS. THANK YOU WE ARE NOT TALKING ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ANDYOU KNOW I MAY START WITH JUST A PROCESS QUESTION I'M TRYING O UNDERSTAND IS THIS THE FIRST HEARING THIS BILL HAS HAD- IN ANY COMMITTEE AT ALL. THIS YEAR. WAS HEARD IN THE SUB FIVE HEARING IN IN JULY. CAN WE. I'M REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A FRAMING QUESTION BEFORE WE GET INTO THE POLICY AND THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE BILL AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S THE GOVERNOR WHO PUT OUT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER EXTENDING THE DEADLINE FROM JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THIS BILL AT ALL. IF WE CURRENTLY HAVE THAT EXTENSION. SO THE PROBLEM PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ALL THAT D. O. RESPONDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL. IS INTENDED TO OPERATIONALIZE BASED ON THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO REALIGN DJJ BUT THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL IS IN THE MAY REVISION FROM THE GOVERNOR. JUST TO CLARIFY PROPOSAL THAT WE ARE HEARING TODAY IS THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSAL NOT THE COVERS. YES SO THE EXTENSION YOU'RE DESCRIBING- GOES BACK TO THE GOVERNOR'S ORIGINAL OWES ALL THAT WAS APPROVED AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND CONTINUED AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR. TO MOVE THE STATE LEVEL DJJ OVER TO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ANIME REVISION- AFTER SORT OF THE PANDEMIC- AND LOOKING AT SORT OF HOW WE BEST USE OUR RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE AND MAKE A GOOD POLICY OUTCOMES WE DECIDED THAT IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE BEST TO MOVE. YOU WITH- AWAY FROM THE STATE LEVEL TO THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THEY CAN BE CLOSE TO THEIR FAMILIES AND HAVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES- AND BE CLOSER TO COMMUNITY FOR RE ENTRY SERVICES IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. SO THE PROPOSAL TODAY IS IN- RELATION TO THAT REALIGNMENT NOT THE SHIFT BETWEEN- SEEK THE CDC OUR OPERATOR OVERSEEING DJJ AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WHICH IS WHAT THAT. EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS IN RELATION TO. IF I CAN REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATORS PROPOSAL BECAUSE- AND AGAIN I APOLOGIZE I UNDERSTOOD THIS TO BE UNDER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND WAS SURPRISED THEN THAT IT'S HARD UNDER SUB FIVE AND NOT SUB ONE AND SO I WILL BE. BE FORTHCOMING IN SHARING I HAVE MORE THAN MY FAIR SHARE OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE FROM THE SUMMARY THAT I SEE WE HAVE. A NEW OFFICE WE ARE TRANSFERRING REGULATIONS AND FUNDING. WE HAVE A NEW FUNDING FORMULA WE DISCUSS A NEW IT SYSTEM AND WE'RE COMMITTING OURSELVES TO. OUT HERE FUNDING OF OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT HAVING SOME OF THE PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS ASKED AND SO I'D LIKE TO JUST UNDERSTAND. WHAT OUR STATED GOALS AND METRICS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. HELLO HELLO HELLO JENNIFER ANSWER OR DO YOU WANT DO YOU HAVE TO DO ONE AFTER FOR SOME SORT. THE BLACK GIVEN THAT THE- BEING DISCUSSED TODAY IS- THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL I AS I. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND. ON JENNIFER CAME WITH THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE SUB FIVE- THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL JUST THIS IS STEP BACK- THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORTED THE TRANSFER. OF DJJ FROM CDC ARE TWO EIGHT HHS- WE- ARE NOW BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE MAY REVISION TO STOP THAT TRANSFER AND SO WE- ACTUALLY STOP THE FUNDING TRANSFERS WEALTH FROM CDC R. DHHS IN THE JUNE FIFTEENTH BUDGET- AGREEMENT AND- HAVE AGREED TO WORK OVER THE SUMMER TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO OPERATIONALIZE. THIS OP REALIGNMENT IN A MINUTE IN A WAY THAT- ADDRESS IS KIND OF THE MEMBERS CONCERNS AROUND DOING THE ALIGNMENT THE RIGHT WAY WITH PROPER OVERSIGHT. AND SO SOME OF THE PIECES THAT YOU SEE IN THERE ARE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN PAST YEARS- AROUND WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST- KIND OF INTERVENTION AND- OF THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT NEEDED FOR THE COUNTIES TO TAKE ON THE SYSTEM. IN A WAY THAT- AS DR WEBER HAS STATED THAT WE DON'T GET A JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY SITUATION- SO THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES- SEVERAL ELEMENTS- LUKE. ALLUDED TO A FOR. THAT KINDA LOOKS AT- THE COUNTY SHARE THE YOUTH POPULATION- ADJUDICATIONS FOR SEVEN OH SEVEN B. OFFENSES WHICH ARE THE OFFENSES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. TO BE SENT TO THE J. J. AS WELL AS PRIOR DJJ USAGE WE ALSO INCLUDE- SECURE A ONE TIME SECURE FACILITY- GRANT PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT COUNTIES CURRENTLY YOU MAY NEED TO UPGRADE THEIR CURRENT- JUVENILE FACILITIES IN ORDER TO TAKE ON THIS NEW POPULATION AND THE FINAL FINALLY THERE'S SOME COMPETITIVE FUNDING. THAT'S PROVIDED FOR EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH BASED PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING JUVENILE JUSTICE- ALONG WITH THAT WE- THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN OFFICE OF YOUTH JUSTICE. WHICH IS ALL CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ACTUALLY. UGH IN THE MINORITY IN TERMS OF NOT HAVING A CENTRALIZED STATE LEVEL- LEADERSHIP AGENCY THAT KIND OF DELVES INTO JUVENILE JUSTICE ISSUES AND CURRENTLY- WITH THE REALIGNMENT OF DJJ THE STATE IS FUNDAMENTALLY GETTING OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF- WHAT. THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN THE STATE'S ROLE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD ONCE YOU THEIR- REALIGNED SORRY NUMBER WASN'T EXPECTING TO SPEAK SO MUCH. AND I WILL SHARE. WANTING TO WORK TOWARDS MAKING SURE THAT YOUTH ARE GIVEN AS MUCH CHANCE AS WE CAN TO REHABILITATE AND BELIEVE THERE IS A LOT OF LOGIC BETWEEN. PUTTING IT UNDER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT I'M- TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT OCCURRED AND I'M SORRY FOR IT BUT THE BILL THAT AMENDED YESTERDAY AND WE'RE SITTING HERE TODAY ASKING SOME QUESTIONS ON IT WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKED TO. VOTE ON THIS HERE SHORTLY AND I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE KICKING THE TIRES BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A TRANSITION LOOKS LIKE SURE AND DOCTOR ARAMBULA- THE OFFICE OF YOUTH JUSTICE WILL BE CREATED UNDER THE HHS UMBRELLA- WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE EXPERTISE THAT'S IN THAT AGENCY AND I THINK THAT'S- A- BOTH SENTIMENT AND A PRIORITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXPRESSED URINE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE MOST. APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO PROVIDE KIND OF THE STATE LEVEL GUIDANCE GUIDANCE. WHAT WE- IT LIKE A- AS LUCAS. IF IADD ON ABOUT TRANSIT AREA ED I THE AS EIGHT TWENTY THREE THAT TRANSITION BE WHAT THE CLOSURE OF THE WOULD NOT HAPPEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE BOTH FOR THE SUBJECT UNTIL AND THEN FOR THE FINAL CLOSURE IN DECEMBER AND THE REASON FOR THAT DELAY IS TO GIVE COUNTY SOME TIME TO DEVELOP THAT OUR RESOURCES SO THAT THEY ARE PREPARED FOR THIS TRANSITION BEFORE THE TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITIES- IT DOES ALSO INCLUDE. FUNDING FOR COUNTIES IF THEY CHOOSE TO WITHDRAW COUNTIES BUT WITH ALL USED ONLY WITHIN THAT DATE AND SO THEY ARE PREPARED TO DO SO THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO START DRYING DOWN SOME OF THAT FUNDING THAT% BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE USED TO HELP. OFFSET THE COST. THANK WE THAT CAN ARE. LET ME ASK IT DIFFERENTLY WHAT STEPS THE IN TAKE TAKEN TO COLLABORATE WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS FOR THIS PROPOSAL HAVE WE TALKED WITH COUNTY IS ABOUT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO RECEIVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY. ALL YES WE HAD A SIGNIFICAN COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S ASSOCIATION AND- THAT COUNTY ASSOCIATION AS WELL ON THE PROPOSAL I THINK THAT THE TWO MAIN ELEMENTS HERE THAT HAVE IT MAKE US FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE REALIGNMENT IS THAT- THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REALIGNMENT DONE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OF JUVENILES AND APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN- VERY PRETTY SUCCESSFUL THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT YOU- STAYING CLOSE TO HOME ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES- BECAUSE OF REENTRY SERVICES BEING CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILY- TO KIND OF ILLUSTRATE SORT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THERE WAS ELEVEN THOUSAND YOUTH IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES LOCALLY NOW THERE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IF THERE WAS THIRTY SIX HUNDRED A DECREASE OF ALMOST 70% SO IT'S THOSE THINGS IN MIND- IN ADDITION TO OUR- YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATION HERE WITH THOSE ENTITIES THAT HAS A STILL COMFORTABLE THAT THEY ARE READY TO TAKE IT ON UNDER OUR PROPOSAL- I BELIEVE THEY'RE THEY'RE IN OPPOSITION TO THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL AS A RUSE AS CONSTRUCTED AND SB. EIGHT EIGHT TWENTY THREE CELL YES JENNIFER COMMITTEE COME INTO THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS CONTRARY THAT WE'RE HEARING A PROPOSAL THAT THE SEEMS LIKE THE COUNTIES ARE IN OPPOSITION TO. THIS IS SO THE K. HAVE WEIGHED AND I THINK THEY'VE PROVIDED CRITIQUE ON BOTH PROPOSALS- PART OF THE REASON WHY WE CROSS THE BILL WAS THAT WE CAN HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS AND WE'VE- LET THEM KNOW THAT- NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING- SO WE ARE INCORPORATING THEIR FEEDBACK. ON THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGES ASSOCIATION DID SUBMIT A LETTER IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE SUPERBOWL PUZZLES- ARM SAYING THAT WAS A BALANCED APPROACH AND IT ACTUALLY PROVIDES A TIMELINE THAT'S WORKABLE- TO IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES ONE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO ADD IS THAT CURRENTLY. UP ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE EVERY YEAR ARE JUDICATA FOR THE SEVEN OH SEVEN B. OFFENSES- WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM ELIGIBLE FOR DJJ. ONLY TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE ARE ACTUALLY SENT TO DJJ SO COUNTIES ARE ALREADY KEEPING ABOUT 97% OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE- LOCALLY AND SO- CONSIDERING HOW SMALL THE POPULATION IS- I THINK WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE. WE FEEL THAT COUNTIES WOULD BE EQUIPPED- TO TAKE ON THIS POPULATION. HOW WILL BE ADMINISTRATION THEM PLAN TO WORK WITH COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE CAPACITY. FOR THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OF YOUTH. SO I THINK- THAT WE WOULD ALLOW COUNTIES TO SORT OF WORK AMONGST THEMSELVES TO FIGURE I DETERMINE THE BEST SITUATION FOR THEMSELVES TO FIND TREATMENT SERVICES FOR YOU I THIS IS AN EXISTING PRACTICE TODAY- AND THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS OF OUR PROPOSAL- THAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD CONTEMPLATED A LOT MORE STRUCTURE TO AROUND. SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN THIS YOU KNOW STOP WATCHING THIS- HUBS AND HAVING- YOU KNOW VERY SPECIFIC SORT OF FUNDING STREAMS AND CRITERIA AROUND THAT BUT AFTER A LOT OF DISCUSSION WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IT WAS YOU CAN CLEAR THAT- THEY NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY AND SOMETIMES MAYBE EVEN NOT. THAT THE- SORT OF. FEELING THE NAME OF BEING AHUB- BUT FINDING THOSE COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY THAT HAVE THE INTEREST IN PUTTING THAT ON AND THEN ALLOWING THEM TO TRANSFER MY FUNDS AMONGST THEMSELVES ABOUT. HOW TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES LOCALLY. WELL I THINK THE FIVE. YOU KNOW WE HEARD ABOUT JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY EARLIER AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO. MAKE SURE WE HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A REALIGNMENT BLOCK GRANT. HOW HOW WILL WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS FUNDING FORMULA ENSURES AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION THE COUNTIES. BASED ON WHAT WAS JUST MENTIONED. SO IF I CAN SPEAK TO THAT FUNDING- DOT UNDER SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE. THAT BLOCK GRANT WOULD BE PROVIDED THROUGH A FORMULA WHICH WOULD INCLUDE MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING THAT TOTAL YOUTH POPULATION IN THE COUNTY. AND TALK YOUR IS THE TOTAL USE OF DJJ IN RECENT YEARS. BY THAT COUNTY AND ALSO THE TOTAL EDUCATION FOR H. ELIGIBLE IT WOULD ALSO GUARANTEE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF FUNDING. FOR COUNTIES SOUTH COUNTY THAT HAVE LOW NUMBERS OF EDUCATION'S WOULD BE GUARANTEED TO SOME STABLE AMOUNT OF FUNDING- THE OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS IT WOULD ALSO HELP COUNTIES DEVELOP THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE YOUTH. AND EIGHT COUNTIES WOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONTRACT BETWEEN COUNTY SAID THEY WOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED JUST IN OUR OWN THEIR RESOURCES WITHIN THE COUNTY THERE WOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED TO. CONTRACT WITH OTHERCOUNTIES AND COULD THEY COULD USE THE FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH THE GRANTS TO HELP. COVER THOSE COSTS. I TO BE CLOAKED BUT SOMETIME I CAN'T MY- THIS FEEL LIKE A PUTTING THE BEFORE THE HORSE. AND I WONDER SOMETIMES HOW WE- MAKE SURE THE POLICIES ARE WELL VETTED BEFORE WERE. HAVING TO EVALUATE THEM ASK QUESTIONS AND VOTE ON I'M IN THE MATTER OF HOURS. AND SO I'M WONDERING AGAIN IF I CAN START WITH MY FIRST QUESTION. WHAT'S THE URGENCY AND RUSH TO DO THIS SINCE THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS PUSH THIS OFF UNTIL NEXT YEAR. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO ASK THE APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS HAVE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT HAVE DELIBERATIONS BECAUSE- IF IT CAUGHT ME A LITTLE BIT BY SURPRISE AND FEEL. FEELS A LITTLE CONCERNING TO ME THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS READY AND THAT- WE COULD BENEFIT FROM MORE TIME WORKING ON THIS PROPOSAL AND SO WOULD LIKE TO. SEE IF YOU HAVE A- SLIGHTLY CHANGE RESPONSIBLE. I'M SO JUST TO KIND OF REITERATE REITERATE THAT THE PROPOSAL ORIGINALLY CAME FROM THE GOVERNOR I WILL SAY THAT IN OUR SUB COMMITTEE AND I THINK IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE POLICY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. THERE HAVE BEEN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE CLOSURE OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND REALIGNMENT SO DID THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR AT LEAST A DECADE- AND I THINK PART OF THE REASON- THAT WERE READY TO HAVE IT NOW IS THAT THE POPULATION HAS GOTTEN SO SMALL. UNFORTUNATELY THE MOST RECENTRECIDIVISM REPORT- THAT I HAVE ACCESS TO STILL SHOWS AND OVER 73% RECIDIVISM RATE AND THE STATE CURRENTLY SPENDS APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOUNG PERSON STATED THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME FISCAL REASONS AS TO WHY THE GOVERNOR- CHOSE THIS MOMENT- TO DO THE REALIGNMENT- I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK. ON THEIR BEHALF BUT I WILL SAY FOR- SOME OF THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THIS IS A POLICY THAT HAS BEEN KIND OF CRAFTED OVER THE YEARS. AND SO THERE ARE PIECES OF IT THAT HAVE BEEN VETTED- FOR SOME TIME. I WOULD JUST TO SORT OF CARE THAT TO SUGGEST JUST THIS WAS FIRST BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE NISS MINISTRATION IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR AND THE FIRST BUDGET- NOT EXACTLY IN THIS FORM WITH THE MOVING OF DJJ SO WE HAD A YEAR LONG DISCUSSION LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- WE WERE NOT ABLE TO REACH. AGREEMENT WITH SOME OF THE DETAILS BUT DID AGREE TO MOVE THE AGENCY THIS YEAR THEY CAME BACK WITH A- REVISED PROPOSAL TO NOT MOVE IT TO THE AGENCY BUT THEN. MOVE IT TO THE COUNTIES IN SO AT LEAST. L. WITHIN THIS CAN. THERE'S BEEN A PER SICK. AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION ON ON THIS ON THIS IDEA WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION FOUR I THINK THE BETTER PART OF ALMOST TWO TWO YEARS- I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN. BUT I WILL JUST SAY THAT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE. GREATER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WILL HAVE STAKEHOLDER AGREEMENT. AND SO- AND YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THAT FOR MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THE COMPLICATED ISSUES YOU DO WITHIN YOUR SUB COMMITTEE- AND SO I WOULD SAY- I KNOW THAT THIS- THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL COMING OUT. ON A FOR YOU TO DIGEST BUT I WILL SAY THIS IS THIS HAS BEEN- HERE THE COMMITTEE HAS SPENT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME ON THIS. WITH ALL THE VARIOUS- STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEEN TRYING TO ENGAGE. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION- THIS WAS AGAIN- BASED ON THEY WERE TRYING TO PRESENT TRY TO HAVE A RESOLUTION. ON THEIR ORIGINAL JANUARY PROPOSAL THERE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL IS SOMETHING THAT WE COMMITTED T TRY TO RESOLVE BUT- BEFORE WE- CLOSED OUT IN A BOX. AND I AM PLEASED TO THE TIME AND WILL ALLOW TO HAVE QUESTIONS THAT I WILL JUST. AND OPINING. HISTORICALLY OUR STATE GONE THROUGH DISCUSSIONS REGARDING REALIGNMENT IN YEARS AFTER A CENSUS. AND IT SEEMS THAT THIS TYPE OF DISCUSSION IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REALIGNING. RESPONSIBILITIES AND FINDINGS BETWEEN STATE AND COUNTIES. THAT THIS DECISION AND DISCUSSION COULD BENEFIT FROM A TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR. BUT THAT'S- A CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER DAY SIMPLY JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. I STILL NEED TO DO A LOT MORE WORK AND WILL BE WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE TO GET MANY MORE OF OUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED- BEFORE I CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THIS TRAILER BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST. YEAH I'M I WANT TO. THANK GO. MISS KIM AND OTHERS FOR IT WE'VE HAD QUITE A BIT OF CONVERSATION ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- AND- NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT LAST YEAR AS WELL LOTS OF STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT LOTS OF PROPOSALS OF AND EVEN MORE RECENTLY I GUESS ABOUT A WEEK AGO WE HAD A ANOTHER HEARING ON THIS MATTER WITH REGARD TO THIS. LOTS OF STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION I THINK THE TWO HOUSES ARE PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH EACH OTHER AS TO WHAT WE WANT WHAT WE THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN- WE'VE CONSISTENTLY SAID THAT- IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE DJJ SHOULD BE ALWAYS BE FOR THE BETTER. OKAY THEN SIMPLY MOVING AT A COST CENTER FROM ONE PLACE TO THE NEXT THAT IT'S NOT A MATTER OF WHO WRITES A CHECK OF WHAT THE PROGRAM IS AND WHAT OUTCOMES ARE AND WHAT WE KNOWS BEST PRACTICES WITH REGARDS TO HANDLE HOW TO HANDLE LIKE YOU. AND I AND SURE THAT THERE WAS SOME EQUITY AND SOME FAIRNESS ACROSS THE BOARD SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE AREAS WHERE- IT'S A COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WOULD NOT AS INTERESTED IN YOUNG PEOPLE AT SOME OTHER PLACE WAS A MESS THEREFORE YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT TO GO TO. BRITAIN MODERATE BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GET A CERTAIN KIND OF HERE VERSUS IN THE VALLEY WHERE YOU MAY NOT GET MUCH OF pOF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE DISPARITY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE FEEL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES VERY IMPORTANT THAT GOES ACROSS AGENCIES- WE MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF PICKING UP A PROGRAM HERE AND PUTTING IT OVER THERE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE. BECAUSE YOU GET THE SAME RESULTS YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED A BETTER RESULTS AND SO WE HAD THINK AS A BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE WE FAIRLY BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE WANT AYE I'VE BEEN CLEAR WITH THE THERE'S THERE THERE OF CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY OVER THERE AND WE'RE PRETTY MUCH TOGETHER. WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THESE DIFFERENCES OUT WITH ADMINISTRATION WITH REGARD SUPPORT IT LOOKS LIKE TO BE VERY HONEST AND UP AND SO WE HAVE- IT'S THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT HAS COME FORTH WITHOUT ANY DETAILS INITIALLY JUST MOVING IT. AND SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM THE ADVOCATES AND FLUSH IT OUT AND TRY TO DO SOME KIND OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE FOR OUR KIDS SO WE'RE STILL OUT HERE YOU KNOW THIS IS THE KIND OF THE SKELETAL. THING THAT'S THE WE SOME MORE INFORMATION. BUT BUT IT'S BEEN A LOT OF. IT IS UNFAIR FOR US. YOU KNOW. INITIATIVE TO BE MOVE. THAT WAS AND THEN WE- ARE WORKING ON ALL OF THE DEAL A LITTLE MOVED BACK THEN SO BE OF ME ALSO. IS A ELSE. SO STILL WORKING ON IT AND KNOW WE WERE COMMITTED TO IT BUT- IT WAS. WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END. OF THE DETAIL OF WE'VE BEEN. TO OFFER. THAT SO THAT IS NOT. JUST A TRAIN. OVER ONE. IN A TO THE NET. AND GET THE SAME RESULTS AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE OF MAKES NUYS PRESS. BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE. NICE OUTCOMES. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AND THIS IS. A REALLY. US SKELETON IDEA THIS IS BECAUSE OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER WE- EVENTUALLY OPERATIONALIZEAND FUN. SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF FOR THE KIDS AND THEY WERE TAKING. IN CONSIDERATION THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE. IN CONJUNCTION WITH WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED AND HOPEFULLY ENGAGE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND SO FORTH AND SO ON THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- WE DON'T WANT TO SYSTEM THE SIMPLY BECOMES A PIPELINE TO PRISON. AND YOU KNOW SO THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOME IT MAKES GETS BETTER SO. WE'VE GOT LOTS OF MEETINGS ABOUT THE CAMPUS. OKAY IN THE END. AND I'LL- THE STAFF ON BOTH SIDES OF HOUSES THAT HAD. ENORMOUS READINGS ADVOCATE AND CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT AND SO- WE'LL TO. IF THIS YEAR MIGHT IF WE TOGETHER ON THE DETAILS OF MY ACTUALLY YOU KNOW. IN PLACE IT'S FIRST. TO SAY THE LEAST. BUT WE ARE COMMITTED. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DONE RIGHT. THANK YOU ROBERT MISTER COOPER THIS IS AN EIGHTY SIX PAGE TRAILER BILL AND DURING COVER NINETEEN THIS IS LINE WITH GOOD INTENTIONS THE PUTTING OUR FRESHEST TRAP COUNTY TO USE ITS ADVANTAGE THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. FOR ANYTHING FOR MAYBE ONE I WISH LEARN THIS LESSON I WAS PART OF AB ONE OH NINE AND AB ONE NINE HAS BEEN A FAILURE- AND GOT THE INMATES AT A STATE PRISON BECAUSE THE OVERCROWDING BUT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES DOING FIFTY DIFFERENT THINGS. THE RECIDIVISM RATE AS HIGH AS HELL IN THE COUNTY JAILS NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FINANCE ANYONE CAN TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. EVEN THE SOCIALLY JUSTICE MOTIVATED CHIEFS WHO WERE SUPPORTIVE OF IT THERE THEY OPPOSE THE BILL RIGHT NOW A. ISSUES THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE TOUGH BUT NOTHING ON THIS BILL. THE X. REALIZE OF THIS FRAUD POPULAR. FACILITY SPACE. RESOURCE ACQUISITION. PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR YOUTH. AND FACILITY RESIGNED FOR TREATMENT. HE GOES TO A COMPETITIVE GRANT FOR THE COUNTIES. SO WITH DJJ RIGHT NOW. THEY'VE A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SEX OFFENDER PROGRAM. THAT'S ONE AWARDS IT DOES A GREAT JOB IT SOLVES IT. SO HOW YOU CAN TAKE UP TO FIFTY COUNTY TO REPLICATE THAT AWARD WINNING PROGRAM. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. SO I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT AND IN A ONE HERE THIS COMMITTEES HAVE YOU SEE. ABOVE US WHO THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WASN'T THOUGHT OUT VERY CLEARLY. ESPECIALLY SMALL NUMBERS YOU GOT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SO YOU GO TO PLACES. THAT HAVE BEEN ALL THESE THE U. S. INFOS BECHTEL SAME COUNTIES WE CAME FROM. THIS SMALL COUNTIES IS ONE COUNTY GONNA HIRE PSYCHOLOGISTS A CLINICIAN TO DEAL WITH THESE KIDS. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN WHEN HE WAS SMALL POPULATION THAT MAY ONLY BE FIVE KIDS FROM FROM FINANCE BOOK ABOUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUS THE PUBLIC'S IS GOING DOWN. WOULD YOU HALL GUESS WHAT. IF YOU ROB SOMEONE WITH A GUN YOU DON'T STAY IN JUVENILE HALL IF YOU RAPE SOMEBODY. YOU GET OUT AND GET TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL WITH A VICTIM YOU RAPED. YOU SHOOT SOMEONE YOU COULD OUT RIGHT NOW SO NOT A LOT OF KIDS IN JUVENILE HALL BECAUSE- OF THE WAY THINGS HAPPEN RELEASED PEOPLE- ALSO YOU TALK ABOUT THESE FACILITIES WHEN THEY GO TO. A PROBATION. UNDER DJJ DIGIDAY. CONTROLS THE SCHOOLS. THE HEALTH. ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE DJJ UMBRELLA. MIDDLE COUNTIES YOUR DEAL WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO IT. IT'S JUST LOW NUMBERS. THAT'S THE THING PEOPLE DON'T FIGURE OUT OUT TO GOT KIDS IN THERE THAT ARE COMMITTEES ADULTS A SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN. YOU TALK ABOUT HAVING KIDS BEING ALLOWED IN THERE TWO OR TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD HOW DO WE DO THAT SEPARATE YOU UNITS STAFFING THEY'RE NOT MANY GIRLS IN THERE SO OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE GIRLS IN THERE YOUR COSTS ARE GOING TO RISE EXPONENTIALLY. BECAUSE BECAUSE A LOT MORE STAFFING THEIR VERY TIME INTENSIVE WITH THAT. SO IT I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT IT DEJECTED CURRENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE YOU KNOW IN ADDITION A TREATMENT FOR SIX SESSIONS AGGRESSOR AGGRESSION REPLACEMENT TRAINING ONE HOUR THREE TIMES A WEEK COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE THIRTY NINE SESSIONS COUNTERPOINT THIRTY THREE SESSIONS. SIX BEHAVIOR TREATMENT A LOT OF THINGS THAT EFFECTIVE SO IF ANYBODY THINKS THEY'RE GOING TO COUNTIES IT'S GOING TO BE A BETTER PROGRAM YOU HAD EXAMINED YOUR FRIGGIN CRAZY IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AT ALL LIKE I SAID IT AND ALSO LOOK AT THE COUNTY WILL HAPPEN AB ONE OH NINE THEY'VE BEEN SUED BY THE PRISON LAW OFFICE THEY'VE ALL BEEN SUED OVER MEDICAL CONDITIONS WHICH SEES THE AUGUST TWO FOUR AND BUILT A HOSPITAL STOCKTON. CONDITIONS A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS THAT C. C. WENT THROUGH FOR MANY MANY YEARS. THAT ACCOUNT IS GOING THROUGH. THE PROCESS POPULATION IN JUVENILE HALL. IT'S THE SAME THING. IT'S FAILURE IF I GO BACK LOOK AB ONE ONLINE WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN'T WORK NO ONE'S DONE THAT. ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE THREE YEARS THIS IS. INCREMENTALLY TWENTY THREE WILL GUESS WHAT. THIS BUDGET CRISIS WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. IS GOING OFF THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS MAYBE NEXT THREE YEARS. SO IT'S JUST IT'S THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS. YOU KNOW AND IT REALLY BECOMES THESE KIDS WE CAN JUST DROP KIDS ON THE DOORSTEP WITH A BAG OF CASH AND WALK AWAY. IN ALL COUNTIES AHEAD OF THE CURVE WHEN IT COMES TO ADULT AND JUVENILE REHABILITATION. SO IT'S I MEAN SO I GUESS FOR FINANCE. WITH ALL THE ACCOLADES DJJ HAS GARNERED OVER THE YEARS. HOW DO YOU CORRELATE THE TWO WITH THE DROP OFF GOING TO COUNTIES. CAN YOU TELL ME THAT. YEAH I THINK THAT THE MOTIVATING FACTOR HERE OR WAS TWO FOLD EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING THAT YOU'D DO BEST WHEN THEY'RE LOW CLOSE TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES- AND THEN SECOND PULLED WAS THE SUCCESS THAT COUNTIES HAD IN THE FIRST JUVENILE- REALIGNMENT FROM THE STATE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND AS I DISCUSSED THAT JUVENILE. DID POPULATION FROM ELEVEN THOUSAND IN 200-072-3600 AND- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ALMOST A 70% DECLINE- MO COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S ACTUALLY HANDLE ALMOST THE ENTIRE JUVENILE SYSTEM NOW WE ONLY HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE YOUTH LEFT AT THE STATE LEVEL AND IT WAS JUST IT WAS THINKING ABOUT IT. IS IT BEST FOR THE STATE TO HOLD ON TO THOSE YOU OR LET THE COUNTIES WHO FOR AREN'TDEALING WITH ALMOST ALL THE YOUTH IN THE STATE AT THIS POINT YEAH WELL TO EXPAND THEIR CAPACITIES AND INTAKE ON INCREMENTALLY A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT I AND I THINK THAT MAKES US FEEL COMFORTABLE. THAT THEY ARE THE APPROPRIATE TO TAKE OUT THE THAT WORK ON AND SO I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A TWO PRONG THING HERE THAT- YOU KNOW IT WAS THE TIMING OF KOBE THINKING ABOUT A FISHING USES A RESOURCE BUT ALSO A LOT OF SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN SEEING THAT USE CAN BE- TO BETTER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AS IT RELATES TO. YOU KNOW EVERY COUNTY HAVING REALLY SPECIALIZED TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE DON'T ENVISION THAT I DON'T THINK THE COUNTIES ENVISIONED THAT IT'S DAY ENVISION ACTUALLY HAVING YOU KNOW SORT OF REGIONAL PLACES WHERE THEY WILL GO AND HAVE THAT SPECIALIZED TREATMENT- THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT THAT PRESCRIBED IN STATE LAW AND HOW THAT WOULD BE BE PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE- DIFFERENT COUNTIES HAVE DIFFERENT RESOURCES. AND THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO DO WHAT WORKS BEST BASED ON WHAT THEY HAVE SO THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE THINKING THERE- AND I YOU KNOW WE I THINK IT DEREK THERE IS MERIT TO THE PROPOSAL WELL THE THINKING SLIDE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO. DJJ THE KIDS ARE THEY THAT THE NUMBER SMALL. BUT ALSO THE MOST VILE. PEOPLE THAT THE ADDRESS THAT'S THAT'S THE- ANALYSTS SAY BUT THAT'S- HIGH PROFILE PEOPLE BETTER THEIR SOUL AND IT IS PUSHED UP THE COUNTIES THE COUNTIES ALL HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES IT'S LIKE AB ONE ONLINE. FOR STATE PRISONS. IT'S ALL OVER THE BOARD WITH THAT. SO THE CATTLE HAD DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY OF THE CAPABILITIES TO DO IT. THAT'S THAT WE DON'T GET THAT. LIKE I SAID YOU KEEP GOING BACK TO SMALL POPULATIONS ALL OVER ALL OVER THE STATE. THOSE COUNTIES ARE GONNA HIRE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SALARIES YOU PAY A LOT OF SONGS FOR CLINICIAN. FOR A- THE- PSYCHOLOGIST. IN THOSE PROGRAMS ARE GONNA REPLICATE THOSE PROGRAMS. LOOK AT THE MONEY AND RESOURCES. DJJ HAS THESE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE IT THEY DON'T COME CLOSE. NOT A LEVEL THE IN THE POPULATION HIGH NEEDS POPULATION THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH THEY DON'T HAVE IT. AND FOR YOU GUYS SIT THERE SAY THEY CAN DO IT IS REALLY DISINGENUOUS. EVEN TO SERVICE TO THE CITIZENS AND THOSE KIDS THEY NEED HELP AND RIGHT NOW THAT HOPE LIES AT DJJ. IT TOOK YEARS TO GET THERE TO MAKE DJJ THAT WAY. BECAUSE OF LAWSUITS BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU GO BACK TO THE COUNTIES THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN. IT'S LIKE IT'SLIKE A LOOKING FOR A- IT'S LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM. IT'S WORKING RIGHT NOW. THE NUMBERS ARE LOW. IT WORKS IT'S EFFECTIVE THESE KIDS WE DON'T WANT THEM COMING BACK CELESTE DOT REHABILITATION THIS IS WHAT WORKS THIS IS GOOD REHABILITATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS BEING AFFECTED WE KNOW WITH THE METRICS THAT PROVE IT. THE BENCHMARKS I TALKED TO SOMEBODY TODAY WHO HELPED CREATE THESE PROGRAMS. AND THEY'RE LIKE WHY THEY CHANGED TAKEN OUT OF THERE. WE'RE THE EXPERTS. AN UPDATE TO THE COUNTIES. AND IT'S JUST IT'S A SCREW THAT UP IT IS A CASH GRAB COMPETITIVE GRANTS YOU GOT BETTER GRANT WRITERS IN LA O SAN FRANCISCO THIS IS SOMEBODY MODOC COUNTY OR SOMEBODY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GONNA GET MORE MONEY. HI THIS IS A THIS IS HORRIBLE SO. I'VE I'VE- BUT I'M DONE WITH THIS. IF I MAY ASK A COUPLE OF POINTS OF CLARIFICATION ON THE FUNDING SIDE OF THE PROPOSAL OKAY. THE ARMY REVISION PROPOSALS OUT PROVIDING HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOUTH WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE WHAT WAS PROVIDE UNDER LAST REALIGNMENT. AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION WITH STAKEHOLDERS COUNTY PROBATION APARTMENTS. AND COUNTIES WE REALIZE THAT THAT MORE FUNDING WAS NEEDED AND WE RAISE THE AMOUNT IN OUR PROPOSAL TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WHICH IS I THINK A SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION. OF YEAH BUT A PROVIDE THEM THE RESOURCES TO BE SUCCESSFUL- AND THEN SECONDARILY THE PROPOSAL ISN'T CONDITIONED ON- COMPETITIVE GRANT. OUR PROPOSAL WAS STRUCTURED AND THAT WITH A IN THE PAST THREE YEARS AS THE DISTRIBUTION BY COUNTY SO IT WOULD BE CLEAR THAT THE COUNTIES THAT WERE MOST IMPACTED WE GET TE MOST RESOURCES- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A DIFFERENT PREFERENCE AND LOOKING AT HOW THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTING WERE OPEN THAT CONVERSATION- BUT- JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A POINT OF CLARIFICATION ON SOME OF THE ASPECTS OF OUR PROPOSAL. SO THAT MONEY ONGOING OR ITS ONE TIME FUNDING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. ITS ONGOING FINDING THAT RAMPS UP AS- THE POPULATION RAMPS UP LOCALLY. AND THEN STARTING IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WE ADDED. AN ELEMENT OF GROWTH TO THE FUNDING. TO JUST ONE BUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS BARELY PAYS FOR ONE CLINICIAN. AND ONE PSYCHOLOGIST. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES THAT THAT USE UP YOUR MONEY YOUR BODY'S. SO THE INITIAL X. THAT WE CONSIDER ALL DENTAL ONE OF GOT MORE THINGS TO GET ON TO SOMEONE. GO. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. KEROSENE DONE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO IT SB A TWO FOR THE ON THE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. LOL. GOOD AFTERNOON ANY DAILY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE ASSESSMENT AND THE COLLECTION OF AROUND TWENTY CRIMINAL JUSTICE RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AS OF JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MOST OF THE FEES ARE CHARGED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL DIRECTLY TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE INTERACTING WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEY GENERALLY FALL WITHIN THREE CATEGORIES ON ONE SIDE OF THE FEES FALL WITHIN- THEY'RE RELATED TO PROGRAM SO THAT ARE ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. SUCH AS WORK RELEASE PROGRAMS HOME DETENTION AND ELECTRONIC MONITORING. A SECOND GROUPING OF FEES RELATED TO BOOKINGS AND ARRESTS AND THEN THE THIRD GROUPING OF FEES RELATES TO PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE INDIGENT DEFENSE REPRESENTATION. IN RECOGNITION OF THE REVENUE LOSS FROM THE ELIMINATION OF THE FEES THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING SIXTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO COUNTIES. BEGINNING AND- TWENTY TWENTY THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET YEAR. THANK YOU THE PART OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ERIN EDWARDS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THAT WAS AGREED TO- AT LEAST A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AS PART OF A THREE PARTY BUDGET DEAL- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH STAFF TO HAMMER OUT ALL OF THE DETAILS- AT THIS POINT I THINK WE HAVE AGREEMENT ON THE- PACKAGE OF FEES THAT WOULD BE REPEALED ARE WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAFF TO- RESOLVE. THE ISSUE OF- EXACTLY HOW THE FUNDING BACK SO WOULD BE PROVIDED TO COUNTIES- IN TERMS OF THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WE HAVE AGREED TO SET ASIDE SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PURPOSE BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- AND AGAIN JUST A MATTER OF SECONDS HAMMERING OUT THE DETAILS BEHIND THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS. MISTER ROGERS. SO READING THE INTENT LANGUAGE AT THE TOP OF THE TRAILER BILL- IT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THE NEED TO- DECRIMINALIZE POVERTY. BUT LOOKING AT THE FEES THAT ARE BEING REPEALED HERE THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE MEANS TESTED SO THOSE AREN'T FEES THAT ARE BEING BORNE BY PEOPLE THAT ARE IN POVERTY ANYWAY. SO I DO EXPLAIN THAT DICHOTOMY BECAUSE I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT. IN OTHER WORDS WHAT'S THE RATIONALE OF REPEALING THE FEES IF THESE AREN'T FEES THAT POOR PEOPLE ARE PAYING ARE WE JUST SUBSIDIZING THE PEOPLE. THAT CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE FEES AND ACTIVISTS. THIS CALL YOUR JENNIFER ONE ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT WILL. OUR UNDERSTAND I'M SORRY IF YOU CAN HEAR ME- ARE UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE WERE FEES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING THE CLOSEST IMPACT TO- INDIVIDUALS AND KIND OF THEIR DAILY IMPACTS ON LIFE AND SO THESE WERE THE ONES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. FOR THIS SPELL- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE TAKEN ACTION OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS- IN THE CRIMINAL FINANCIER REUNITED TO ALLEVIATE BURDENS ON INDIVIDUALS AND SO I WOULD JUST OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THIS IS KIND OF A NEXT STEP IN THAT PROCESS. RIGHT WELL I MEAN WOULD YOU DISAGREE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE FEATURE APPEALING HERE ARE MEANS TESTED. WE WOULD SO WE WOULD SAY THAT IT IS IN THE LEGISLATURE CHOICE IN TERMS OF WHAT. FEES FINES EXCITER ARE ACCEPTABLE AS PUNISHMENT FOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES. ALL RIGHT WELCOME SON OF JENNIFER CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OR. SO BRANDY STANDING IS AT THE LIST OF FEES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPACTFUL TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIST INCLUDES- OF PUBLIC DEFENDER FEES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR INDIGENT PEOPLE SO EVEN. TO RECEIVE A PUBLIC DEFENDER THERE IS SOME NOMINAL FEE THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO PAY I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT VIEW IS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD- BUT THERE ARE FEES THAT ARE ASSESSED OKAY BUT IF THE FEES ARE MEANS TESTED. THEN IF THEY'RE ATTEMPTED TO BE ASSESSED AGAINST SOMEONE WHO IS IMPOVERISHED THEY YOU WOULD SHOW THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE MEANS AND THEREFORE NOT HAVE TO PAY THE FEE AND MY CONCERN IS. THAT BY ELIMINATING THE COURT'S ABILITY TO CHARGE THESE FEES WHAT WE'RE REALLY AT AND PROVIDING SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO BACK FILL THAT REVENUE WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THE PAYMENT OF THOSE FEES BY THE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEM. IT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL OF THESE FEES ARE ACTUALLY MEANS TESTED FOR EXAMPLE CITY AND COUNTY BOOKING FEES- JUST ASSESSED. FOR ANY PERSON WHOSE- BOOKED INTO CUSTODY SURE BUT THOSE ARE FORTY THE FEES HERE THERE'S A THERE'S A LONG LIST OF THEM THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE MEANS TESTED SO OFTEN WHAT WHY ARE WE- CONSIDERING ELIMINATING THEM. BASED ON OUR STUDY- THESE FEES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY ANTI POVERTY ORGANIZATIONS OF HAVE AS HAVING THE MOST IMPACT ON THEIR- MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE SPECIFIC PEAS FEES. ON THE MUCH. THE LITTLEST WAS MUCH LONGER- AND THESE WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING THE MOST KIND OF EVERY DAY- UP COMMON FEES THAT ARE ASSESSED. TO PEOPLE ENTERING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM OKAY BUT I MEAN I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM HERE IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE POVERTY. IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S CRIMINALIZED. BUT THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS TO FIGURE OUT WHICH OF THESE FEES ARE BEING PAID BY PEOPLE- THAT ARE IMPOVERISHED IN MEANS TESTED FEES BY DEFINITION I DON'T THEY FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY SO. NOT THAT'S MY CONFUSION. BETTER FOLLOW UP. IS KIND OF A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT I MEAN JUST TO MAKE THE POINT. WE HEAR THE LEGISLATURE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS IN THE NAME A FUTURE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURES RIGHT SO WE CAN JUST PUT INTENT LANGUAGE CHEN. TO OUR HEARTS CONTENT HERE AND SAY IT'S OUR INTENT THAT EVERY YEAR WE CAN APPROPRIATE. SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BACK FILL THE COURTS ON THIS REVENUE LOSS BUT- HISTORY IS REPLETE WITH OCCASIONS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE EXPRESSED AN INTENT TO DO THAT AND THEN FAILED TO DO IT AND SO. I HAVE A FURTHER CONCERN ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- OUR COURTS AS WE KNOW ARE ALREADY UNDER FUNDED AND OVERSTRESSED. I PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL PARTS OF OUR STATE AND SO- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I I'M REALLY VERY WARY AT THIS. THANK YOU THE COMMENTS. OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY YEAH I MISINTERPRETED YOUR QUESTION SO I SUPPORT THIS- BUT I SUPPORT IF YOUR PEOPLE ARE POOR OR- CAN'T AFFORD IT THE BIGGEST RELIEF THIS IS THE BLANKET EXEMPTION FOR PEOPLE SO YOU A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE- FOR INSTANCE. DRUNK DRIVERS THEY ARE SENTENCED TO. HOME DETENTION A RELEASE MEDICAL BRACELET MONITORING. SO THAT WOULD THE WITH THE BILL'S PROPOSED THEY WOULD PAY NO FEES CORRECT. IF I MAY UM ANNUALLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I THINK YOU WOULD NEED TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE OFFENSE THAT WAS AN INDIVIDUAL IS CONVICTED OF SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOU ARE USING I'M DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE THERE MAY BE OTHER FEES AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE ATTACHED TO FOR EXAMPLE THE INTERLOCKING NISH AND EXCITER OUT AND SO THAT IS NOT ONE OF THE FEES THAT'S PART OF THIS. PACKAGE AND SO YOU'D WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC FEET- THE SPECIFIC OFFENSES- THAT WERE- CHARGED AND CONVICTED AND AN INDIVIDUAL IS CONVICTED OF. THE SIXTIES TRAILER BILL SO. IT'S A LOT OF PAGES THAT'S LESSEN THE TRAILER BILL TO GO THROUGH SO I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE A LOT OF FOLKS COME DOWNTOWN TO HANG OUT AND SOCIALIZE. SO INDIVIDUALS GET DRUNK DRIVING IS HEADED BACK TO THE SUBURBS SOLANO FOLKS THAT THEN THE SUBURBS CAN AFFORD TO PAY THESE FEES SO LIKE I SAID I'M I'M JOHN THAT DISTINCTION. FOR THE POOR AND INDIGENT YEAH THEY SHOULDN'T PAY WE GOTTA GIVE RELIEF AND GET MY HAND UP BUT. FOR THOSE FOLKS THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY. DIED DIGEST IN THIS- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE ALTERNATE SYNCING PROGRAM FOR FOLKS- A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS CAN WORK IT OFF IT IT BUT NONPROFITS WE'VE- THOSE OFFICIOUS REAL THINGS. SO IT'S SO NO ONE CAN TELL ME RIGHT NOW FOR DRUNK DRIVING QUALIFIES INTO THAT SYSTEM IT'S ON ANKLE BRACELET MONITORING BECAUSE I GUESS THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IF SOMEONE IS. SOMEONE HAS TO PAY FOR THAT INCOME BRACELET SO. I MEAN THIS THE REST THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THIS. IN MY SERVICE TO TAXPAYERS FOLKS THAT ARE. WORKING CLASS PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE MINIMUM WAGE HELP CONTRIBUTE TO IT. SO IN THE AVERAGE PERSON THE AVERAGE AVERAGE. PERSON IF EVERY CHEMICAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD COME THROUGH THAT THROUGH A DRUNK DRIVING. SO HELP ME HELP ME GET THERE ON THAT. SO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- A NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE OPERATED BY THE COUNTIES COUNTIES HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOW THEY OPERATE THEM ON AS WELL AS WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHARGED A FEE AS WELL AS HOW MUCH OF THE FEE WAS CHARGED- SO WITH THE ELIMINATION OF THESE FEES. AND THE FACT THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER BE COLLECTED THAT IS WHAT OUR UNDERSTANDING BEHIND TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION COMING TO AGREEMENT OF- PROVIDING SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE COUNTIES- IN RECOGNITION OF THAT REVENUE LOSS. NOW THAT THE INITIAL TO PAY OFF THE THAT'S ONGOING CORRECT. FIRST ONE TIME TO PAY OFF THE FEES THE FEES ARE OWED BACK FEES. THAT'S WHEN I HAVE A DIRECT. I WOULD DEFER THAT QUESTION TO FINANCE- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THERE ARE STILL DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING RELATED TO THE EXACT DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDING. YES THAT IS THE CASE THAT WE ARE STILL WORKING WITH STAFF- TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL- ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WILL BE- AS WELL AS THE DURATION OF THE FACTUAL. SO IT'S SO IT'S REALLY IT'S A COMPLETE RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE WE IN SESSION ON MONDAY. THAT'S A BIG ISSUE A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS I THINK LIKE I SAID I THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL I CAN ACCEPT TO HELP PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE A LOT OF THE DEVIL'S REALLY IN THE DETAILS. ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS. NOW AS FAR AS VICTIM RESTITUTION HAS THAT FULL THAT GO AWAY. WE'RE THE FALL LINE WITH THAT. IN OUR REVIEW OF THAT SPECIFIC CODE SECTIONS THAT ARE IMPACTED RESTITUTION WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS TRAILER BILL. OKAY WE ALSO JUST SO YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE COME IN AND DO THESE THINGS WITH SOMEONE THAT CAME IN IN THEIR OWN WORK PROJECT WAS A COMMANDER THERE AND THEY WERE UNEMPLOYED YET THAT PERSON HAD A TRUST FUND SO OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE TRUST FUND CAN AFFORD TO PAY. THOSE FEES FOR DRUNKEN DRIVING SO- THAT'S ONE THING I MEAN LIKE SAID WE CAN GET THERE WITH THOSE PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS THAT CAMPAIGN SHOULD PAY LOOK AT THE CELEBRITIES THAT HAVE GOTTEN PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES THAT HAVE GOT ARRESTED FOR DRUNK DRIVING. SO THAT'S KIND OF THE RUB WHERE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THOSE FOLKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO PAY. ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT. THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING WITH EVERYONE WITH YOUR POOR OVER THE RICH YOU'RE ON THE SAME UNDER THIS BILL THIS TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL YOU'RE LOGGED IN THE SAME GROUP. CORRECT. IT WOULD ELIMINATE ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE ABILITY TO ASSESS AND COLLECT SO YES. OKAY THAT'S MY BIG ISSUE WITH THAT AXE. AS A NIGHT INSTEAD OF THE STATE. WE SHOULD HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE POOR THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT BUT IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT BY GOLLY SHOULD PAY. AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE A MECHANISM FOR THAT SO IF YOU GOT TO STILL WORK ON THAT BILL. I SUGGEST THE ADMINISTRATION AT LEAST WORK ON THAT AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE- SACRAMENTO COUNTY IF YOU'RE ON A PROGRAM. YOU GO AND THEY DO WORK ON FINANCIAL SHEET. AND IT'S BASED ON ABILITY TO PAY OR NOT PAY. BUT THERE ARE FOLKS OUT THERE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING THAT DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. CABSI NUMBER GONNA GO TO OUR LAST TRAILER BILL SB EIGHT TWO SEVEN. I'M CANNABIS. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME OKAY. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU SO THE CANNABIS TRAILER BILL SB EIGHT TO SEVEN REALLY HAS THREE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO IT. ON IT HAS A TAX COMPONENT CHANGES RELATED TO THE BSE SEA GRANT CROAK AND CHANGES RELATED TO THE CANNABIS CONTROL APPEAL PANEL. SO LET ME FIRST TURN TO THE EXILE- SHOULD BE TAXED RELATED CHANGES SO IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THE AVERAGE MARKET BETWEEN THE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL PRICE OF CANNABIS. CD TFA DETERMINES WHETHER IT WILL ADJUST THE MARK UP RATE EVERY SIX MONTHS ONCE IN JANUARY AND ONCE IN JULY. THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE DEPARTMENT FROM ADJUSTING THE MARK UP RATE. THAT WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR INJANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF DOING SO RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE EXCISE TAX RATE. FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS HOWEVER WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE. ULTIMATELY THIS WOULD EITHER HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE TAX RATE WERE TEMPORARILY REDUCE. IN ADDITION THERE ARE ALSO CHANGES RELATED. TO THE CULTIVATION TAX CULTIVATION TAX RATE ANNUALLY IN JANUARY TO ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THEM FROM MAKING THAT ADJUSTMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. UNLESS IT IS TO ACCOUNT FOR A NEGATIVE INFLATION RIGHT SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNLIKELY WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT OF THE RIGHT HOWEVER FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS WOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE THE BILL WOULD ALSO LIMIT THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO ADJUSTMENT TO JUST COVERING ONE YEAR OF A VIOLATION. RATHER THAN TO AS A RESULT THE CULTIVATION TAX RATE WOULD NEVER CATCH UP OR COMPENSATE FOR THE MISSED ADJUSTMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND AN ONGOING REDUCTION WOULD RESULT WOULD RESULT. LET ME NOW TURN TO THE CHANGES RELATED TO THE PORT OF SPAIN COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. YES YOU SEE PROVIDES GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH. EFFECTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS BSE C. FOR MAKING GRANTS TO ANY LOCALS THAT HAVE BANNED CULTIVATION. INCLUDING PERSONAL CULTIVATION OR RETAIL SALES THIS BILL WOULD INSTEAD DISQUALIFIED ONLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT BAND BOTH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL CULTIVATION OR HAVE BANNED RETAIL SALES. ACCORDINGLY BSE C. COULD PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCALS THAT HAVE BANNED PERSONAL CULTIVATION. ARE KNOWN FORMALLY SPEAK ABOUT THE CHANGE RELATED TO THE B. CANNABIS APPEALS PANEL. BE CANNIBALISTIC CONTROL APPEALS PANEL CONSISTS OF TWO MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THREE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR UNDER CURRENT LAW MEMBERS MUST BE FROM DIFFERENT COUNTIES. HOWEVER UNDER THIS BILL THAT RESTRICTION WOULD ONLY APPLY TO MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE IT. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS WE CAN THIS ORDER. THE SCHOOL FINANCE I APOLOGIZE. YEAH NOTHING FURTHER FURTHER TO HAVE THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER MONTE. ALL RIGHT ACT. TO THE L. A. L. I. I JUST HAVE TO ASK. WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE BUDGET. ALL THIS IS- THIS HAS TO DO WITH IMPLEMENTING THE ARMS TAXES- THAT ARE ASSUMED IN A BASICALLY. IMPLEMENTING SOME TAX CHANGES- THAT ARE A PART OF THE OVERALL BUDGET PACKAGE OKAY. SO I'M NOT FOR THE RECORD I AGREE WITH MOST OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL ACTUALLY BUT- IT'S UNUSUALLY BLATANT IN THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BUDGET USUALLY WE AT LEAST THROW IN OUR PREPARATION OR TWO AS A TOKEN SO THAT WE COULD WAVE OUR HANDS AND SAY IT'S A BUDGET BILL. BY YOUR ARGUMENT WE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE A COMMITTEE ON REVENUE AND TAXATION BECAUSE WELL ALL OF THAT SHOULD GO THROUGH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE INSTEAD OF THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE AND THE SHAME OF IT IS. THERE'S NO NEED FOR THIS TO BE A BUDGET TRAILER BILL BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY A TWO THIRDS BILL BECAUSE IT CHANGES A U. MA. AT THE END AS YOU KNOW A POLICY THAT THE ONLY ADVANTAGE OF HAVING SOMETHING BE A BUDGET BILL THIS SO THAT IT CAN TAKE IMMEDIATE EFFECT WITHOUT A TWO THIRDS VOTE IT'S GOING TO BE A TWO THIRDS BILL ANYWAY SO THIS THIS BILL SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH POLICY COMMITTEE- AND I'M I'M- I'M SORRY THAT IT DID NOT- ANOTHER QUESTION IF YOU WERE. TESTIFYING ABOUT THE CHANGES TO THE CANNABIS CONTROL APPEALS PANELS. START WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR PUTTING DIFFERENT RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS. ON A BOARD MEMBERS THAT ARE POINTED IN BY DIFFERENT BODIES. I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER THAT QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE- THE ORIGINAL TENT WAS I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE ORIGINAL TIME WAS BUT- I WOULD DEFER THE QUESTION TO STAFF AS TO WHAT THE INTENT OF THE CURRENT CHANGES ARE YOU'RE ASKING US TO VOTE YES ON IT. AND I'M ASKING YOU WHY THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. EDIT THISIS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL AND MY AND BELIEVE MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM TRYING TO BE SOLVED HERE IS THAT- THERE. THERE ARE TWO MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATURE THREE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR- AND THERE MAY BE AN APPOINTMENT. ADD TO THAT- PANEL- FROM ONE OF THE SAME COUNTY IS AN APPOINTMENT AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ALREADY APPOINTED SO I THINK WHERE IT'S TRYING TO SOLVE FOR THAT ISSUE. WELL JUST TO SAY THAT WE'VE GOT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE OVERLY DIFFICULT. TO FIND FIVE. BOARD MEMBERS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTIES. IT'S STILL HAVE 90% OF COUNTIES ON REPRESENTED ON THAT BOARD SO- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK OUGHT TO BE CHANGED BUT THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE. THANK YOU YOUR COMMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE. PROGRESSING THAT WE ARE NOW THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION. WE'RE GONNA ASK ANYBODY WHO HAS PUBLIC COMMENT FROM- FORTY TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE. THE STATE YOUR NAME AND YOU HAVE A MINUTE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND- MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE BRIAN WHITE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PERSONALIZED LEARNING SERVICES IN SCHOOLS- WE ARE A NETWORK OF EIGHTY FIVE PERSONALIZED PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS THROUGHOUT STATE THE ALSO KNOWN AS A PLUS I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON SB EIGHT TWENTY. EIGHT PLUS HAS NOTHING AGAINST THE HOLD HARMLESS LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED IN SB NINETY EIGHT AND THE FOLLOW UP CLEAN A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE LIMITED PATHWAY FOR FUNDING IN ROAMING GROWTH FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS HOWEVER WHAT WE TAKE EXCEPTION TO AND ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO HIS DEAL LAST PROVISION IN SB EIGHT TWENTY THAT WOULD UNNECESSARILY EXCLUDE ALL NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS FROM ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR. THE LANGUAGE PRESENTS SERIOUS EQUITY ISSUES AND HIRES A VERY STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY FACING SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGES INCLUDING LOW INCOME AND MINORITY STUDENTS DESERVE A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION JUST LIKE ALL SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE CURRENTLY IN CLASSROOM BASED SETTINGS BUT ARE CURRENTLY AND DISTANCE LEARNING RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THE TYPES OF DISADVANTAGES THAT A PLUS SERVICE IT SCHOOLS ARE IN CONSTANT POSITION OF PLANT GROWTH SO THEIR PLAN GROWTH AVERAGES ABOUT 10220% ACROSS ITS NETWORK REGARDLESS OF THE CULPRIT PANDEMIC SO AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT'S ABOUT SCHOOLS AND TWO YEARS THERE ARE NO SCHOOLS WERE TALK ABOUT EXISTING SCHOOLS THAT NEED TO BE FUNDED NOW. WE THOUGHT WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM SIGNED THE SB NINETY EIGHT BILL THAT HE WOULD TALK ABOUT FUNDING ALL TARGETED SOLUTIONS FOR ALL STUDENTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY- SB EIGHT TWENTY MISSES THE MARK AND AS A RESULT IT'S GOING TO UNDER FUND A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE NON CLASSROOM BASE SETTINGS WE WAS RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT AS A SOLUTION. FUND THE 10% GROWTH THAT IS ALREADY AVERAGE FOR THE SCHOOLS ON A TYPICAL SITUATION THAT WOULD BE A COMPROMISE IN OUR OPINION BUT THE NOT TO EXCLUDE THEM FROM TOTAL FUNDING IS REALLY JUST MISSING THE MARK AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO MAKE THE EDUCATION DISADVANTAGES EVEN WIDER FOR NON CLASSROOM BASED TUNES FOR THOSE REASONS WE. OPPOSE THE BILL UNLESS IT'S FIX TO APPLY FOR THAT MANY AMOUNT GROWT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'LL SEE NO OTHER. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR TWO WE WILL NOW GO TO THE PHONES MODERATE ARE YOU THERE. IF YOU IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AFTER TIME.
