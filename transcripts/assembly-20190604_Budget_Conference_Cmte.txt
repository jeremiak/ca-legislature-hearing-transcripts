THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADE UNIT IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE SENATE APPROVED THIS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL AND THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED IT WITHOUT PREJUDICE. THE CONFERENCE ISSUES FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THREE INTERNATIONAL TRADE PROGRAM SPECIALIST POSITIONS. WE HAVE REACHED CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BECAUSE UNDER PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS SIMILAR ACTIVITIES LIKE TRANSPARENCY AND WE'RE NOT ALWAYS EFFECTIVE -- IN ORDER TO THESE PROGRAMS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THE STATE AUDITOR A NOTED THAT THE STATE'S TREATING CONVERSATION SEEM. TO NOT ADEQUATELY MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS PROGRAMS -- SO WE SUGGEST AS A COMPROMISE ADOPTING THE SENATE ACTION TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE POSITIONS AND ALSO TO ADOPT SOME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE. IMAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TREATING IT. TOO CLEARLY ARTICULATE ITS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SET QUANTIFIABLE TARGETS. CLICK DATA AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES. TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE AND REGULARLY REPORT BACK TO THE BACK THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE THINK THIS IS A REAL SHOULD BE ADOPTED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- IS A DOCTOR. THANK YOU AND FINANCE. SO WE ON THIS ISSUE SUPPORT THE SENATE PROPOSAL HOWEVER WE ARE OPEN TO COMPROMISE ALONG SOME OF THE LINES THAT LA -- SUGGESTED. EXCELLENT ALRIGHT LOOK FOR TO THOSE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. BELIEVE THE ITEM OPEN. ISSUE THREE FILM AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT CARRY FORWARD DELEO. THIS IN ITS BUDGET PACKAGE INCLUDES BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD EXTEND BY THREE YEARS THE ALLOWED CARRY FORWARD FOR THE SECOND ITERATION OF THE FILM AND TELEVISION. PRODUCTION TAX CREDITS. A CRITIC CARRY FORWARD IS NEEDED WHEN THE AMOUNT OF TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE TO A FILER EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF TAXES THEY THEY MAY CARRY THE BALANCE FORWARD IT -- TO FOLLOWING YEAR -- SO THIS LANGUAGE WILL EXTEND THE AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE THOSE CREDITS -- WILL EXPIRE AT THE GOVERNOR TO SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE A PROPOSAL RELATED TO THIS TAX PROVISION -- WE KNOW THAT EXTENDING THE KERRY FOR IT WOULD HAVE A MINOR REVENUE AFFECT BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OTHER PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS WILL NOT. THIS WILL REFLECTS THAT PRIOR YOUR REVENUES WHO -- WERE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED BECAUSE THE CREDITS WERE NOT USED WHEN ADDITIONAL INTO SPEED. THANK YOU FINANCE IN MINISTRATION SUPPORTS ASSEMBLY ON THIS PROPOSAL AND IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT ANY ALLOCATION -- IN TERMS OF CREDITS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED IN WHICH CASE ANY CHANGES WOOD AND SHAPE BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THOSE CREDITS HAVE ALREADY BEEN AWARDED. SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME BECAUSE I WASN'T TRACKING SUGAR SUNSHINE. WE'RE LOOKING TO EXTEND THE TIME FRAME TO ALLOW THE ALREADY ALLOCATED CREDITS. TO HAVE TIME TO BE UTILIZED YEAH SO SAY WHAT YOU SAID ONE MORE TIME THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION IS THAT THESE CREDITS -- THE PURPOSE OF THAT NEEDS TO ENCOURAGE THE BEST PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD IN TERMS OF THE VALUE THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING GAS SO IF HE CREDITS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED. THAN CHANGING THE TAX INCENTIVES WOULDN'T CHANGE THAT ALLOCATION AND ANYWAY SO YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INCENTIVE AFFECT OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THE ITEM OPEN. ISSUE FOR ECONOMIC OFFICE OF ECONOMIC IMPACT TRAILER BILL BELIAU. THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED TO CHANGE THE NAME OF GO THIS THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC IMPACT THE SENATE APPROVED THIS TRAILER BILL AND THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THIS CHANGE. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE DIFFERENCE [inaudible] HI FINANCE. WHEN OUR NAME CHIANG? FINANCE ADMINISTRATION HE NEEDS TO BELIEVE THAT THIS NAME CHANGE IS IMPORTANT TO CONVEY TO EVERYONE WHO INTERACTS WITH THIS AGENCY THAT IT IS NOT A LICENSING AGENCY IT IS NOT A REGULATORY OUR OVERSIGHT AGENCY. BUT RATHER IT IS HELPING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF DOING BUSINESS AND INTERACTING. WITH PEOPLE AND COMMERCE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO WANTED TO CONVEY HROUGH THIS NAME CHANGE THAT THE OFFICE WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS NOT SIMPLY DEAL WITH BUSINESSES IT DEALS WITH WORKERS AND A WHOLE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC IMPACT IS THE RIGHT NAME TO CONVEY -- TO EVERYONE INTERACS WITH THIS AGENCY WHAT IT ACTUALLY ONE START WITH THIS -- DEPARTMENT -- WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES? OKAY I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO A JUST A COMMENT. THAT ACRONYM -- III IS IN COMMON USE IN THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY -- WE HAVE THE FOR AIRPLANES YOU HAVE A SET OF PERFORMANCE TABLES AND ANOTHER SET OF WE AYE TABLES AND IT STANDS FOR ONE ENGINE AN OPERATIVE. NOT SURE THAT THAT'S THE IMAGE YOU'RE GOING FOR BUT WE ALL SYSTEMS GO. OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN AND CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE. ISSUE FIVE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION [inaudible] HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN METZGER WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A NEW OFFICE THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THE MISSION OF THE OFFICE WOULD BE TO HELP DEPARTMENTS BETTER OPERATE THEIR PROGRAMS AND DELIVER SERVICES. THE OFFICE WOULD ACCOMPLISH THIS MISSION BY FOR EXAMPLE DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS OR PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE A USER'S EXPERIENCE OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM OR SERVICE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED THIRTY SIX POINT TWO MILLION TOTAL FUNDS OF WHICH THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION IS GENERAL FUND IN. NINETEEN TWENTY AND LOWER AMOUNTS OF FUNDING IN THE OUT YEARS. OF THE THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY MILLION WAS PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH AN INNOVATION FUND THAT THE OFFICE WOULD USE FOR EXAMPLE TO FUND NEW PRODUCTS OR PROJECTS FOR DEPARTMENTS. THE REQUEST ALSO INCLUDED FIFTY POSITIONS AND PROPOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ESTABLISHING THE OFFICE AND GIVING A PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY. WELL THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY AGREED IN CONCEPT WITH ESTABLISHING THE OFFICE THE CONFERENCE ISSUE HERE IS IN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS AND ASSOCIATED FUNDING FOR THE OFFICE. THE PRIMARY REASON THE APPROVED AMOUNTS DIFFER FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY AGREED TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE INNOVATION FUND TO TEN MILLION GENERAL FUND FROM TWENTY MILLION IN. NINETEEN TWENTY BOTH HOUSES ALSO AGREED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS FOR THE OFFICE BUT THE SENATE APPROVED TWENTY POSITIONS WHEREAS THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED. TEN BOTH HOUSES APPROVED A PLACE HOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGETO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE HOWEVER NEITHER HOUSE APPROVED THE REQUESTED PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY. THE SENATE ALSO PROPOSE INCLUSION OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ISSUE OF THIS ISSUE COMES DOWN TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT THIS OFFICE TO DO. AND HOW BIG IT SHOULD BE -- WE DO THINK THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS PROPOSED BY THE SENATE WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE HOWEVER BETTER OVERSIGHT OF THE OFFICE I AM. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS IN THIS ISSUE IS IMPORTANT THAT THE RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTIVES. AND IN PARTICULAR THAT THE PROCUREMENTAUTHORITY IS NECESSARY BECAUSE WE DO SEE THIS OFFICE TAKING A LEAD ROLE IN TERMS OF THE INNOVATION PROCUREMENT SPRINTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS IMAGINING. GREAT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE WILL HOLD ITEM OPEN. I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR A MISTER KING TO GET HERE CALLING FROM THE WALL -- CALL WORLD. HE THOUGHT I FORGOT [inaudible] ISSUE. SIX INSIST TWENTY TWENTY OUT REACH ALEJO THANK YOU THANK YOU THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS RELATED OUR REACH WITH PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION. TO INCREASE THIS AMOUNT BUT BOB BY TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OUT WITH LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. THE SENATE APPROVED THOSE GOVERNOR'S THIRTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR RESOURCES BUT ALSO APPROVED AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THE ASSEMBLY ALSO APPROVED ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN RESOURCES BUT HAD SPECIFIC PURPOSES FOR THOSE RESOURCES. AND ALSO REMOVED THE CAP ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUGMENTATION BOTH HOUSES APPROVED FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING POPULATION SAMPLE ENUMERATION -- BUT THE ASSEMBLY DELAYED TO THIS THIS SURVEY FROM APRIL TO AUGUST. THANK YOU FINANCE MAKE THREE BRIEF POINTS FIRST IS THAT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED LEVEL FUNDINGTHE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE DEDICATED TO THE CENSUS BOTH IN THIS AND PREVIOUS BUDGET AX PUT TOGETHER WOULD BE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARSSO WE BELIEVE -- AS OF RIGHT NOW THAT IS OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT IT'LL TAKE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD A COMPLETE COUNT. A SECOND -- HAS MISS HOLLINGSHEAD NOTED -- UNDER OUR PROPOSED LANGUAGE AT JAIL BC AUGMENTATION WOULD BE UP TO TWENTY TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS SO WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BEYOND THAT AUGMENTATION ABILITY. AT THIS TIME AND THEN FINALLY ON THE THIRD POINT REGARDING THE ENUMERATION SURVEY WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE STARTED WE HAVE PROPOSED IS PASSED TO MAKING SURE THAT THAT ENUMERATION SURVEY. IS AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WILL INTERFERE IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY WITH THE COMPLETE COUNT FOR THE CENSUS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS HAPPENS OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I THINK WE ALL WOULD LIKE THE COUNT TO BE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE. I THINK THERE'S A FISCAL ARGUMENT HERE ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE SPEND MAKING THAT COUNTACCURATE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY ONE OF OUR INCENTIVES FOR MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA GETS COUNTED IS THAT WE GET A DECADE WORTH OF FEDERAL REVENUE THAT'S BASED ON THOSE COUNTS SO. A QUESTION FOR THE LA -- HAVE WE DONE AN ANALYSIS ON HOW MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING IS AT STAKE. I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE TRADE OFFS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT EVEN UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL HERE WERE -- PROPOSING TO SPEND SUBSTANTIALLY MORE MONEY THAN ANY OTHER STATE HAS DONE. YEAH WE ACTUALLY HAVE DONE AN ANALYSIS OF THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING AT STAKE -- SO IN CONTRAST TO PRIOR STUDIES THAT HAVE FOUND THAT POTENTIALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WOULD BE ON THE LINE. OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE CLOSER TO TENS OF MILLIONS POTENTIALLY UP. TO POSSIBLY LE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. THE IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DELTA BETWEEN DOING NOTHING. DOING NO WAY OUT REACH AND THE DELL AND SPENDING YOU KNOW WHAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE THE MAXIMUM OUT OF OUR REACH. NO -- SO. IT'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S A LITTLE BIT NUANCED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OUTRAGE RIGHT SO THIS IS ACTUALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. WHAT OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE STATE WOULD RECEIVE AND FEDERAL FUNDING IF THERE WAS AN UNDERCOUNT SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN NINETEEN NINETY WHICH IS THE LARGEST ON ACCOUNT THAT THE STATE HAS EXPERIENCED IN -- A FEW DECADES SO THE DELTA BETWEEN WHAT WE WOULD EXPERIENCE IN NINETEEN NINETY VERSES IF YOU KNOW THE THE COW WERE. IN OUR VIEW SORT OF REASONABLY ACCURATE AND COMPLETE -- IS THAT FEW HUNDRED MILLION OF COURSE AND THERE'S THIS SORT OF ADDITIONAL QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE MARGINAL VALUE OF ADDITIONAL OUT REACH -- AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S NO GUARANTEE NECESSARILY THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS GOING TO GET YOU A PERFECTLY COMPLETE COUNT SO THAT WOULD BE. A DIFFERENT ANALYSIS OKAY SO. I'M I'M UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SO IF WHAT WHAT LEVEL WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IS BEING YOU KNOW -- SUPPORTED BY THE FISCAL DATA AND LIKE -- YOU KNOW OUR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND DEALS MORE THAN A DOLLAR IN -- IN FUTURE FEDERAL BENEFITS DISCOUNTED FOR THE CURRENT VALUE BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CENSUS ISN'T ONLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL. LAND RIGHT REALIZE THE REPRESENTATION ISSUE -- THERE'S ALSO JUST HAVING ACCURATE AND COMPLETE DATA FOR THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE ITS POLICY DECISIONS -- HAVING ACCURATE AND COMPLETE DATA FOR STATE MONEY TO TRAVEL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT'S A PIECEOF THE ANALYSIS THAT WE NEVER COVERED. SO THERE IS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY MULTIPLE FACETS OF THIS AND THAT FEDERAL FUNDING IS REALLY ONLY ONE SMALL PIECE -- I THINK. OF THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION. BUT IT ARE YOU ARE YOU ASKING FOR LIKE A A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS RETURN ON GROW JUST JUST FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDING JUST WONDERING AT WHAT LEVEL DOES THIS EFFORT PAY FOR ITSELF AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A A LEVEL AT WHICH IT. IT STOPS PAYING FOR ITSELF AND THE ONLY REASON TO SPEND MORE THAN THAT WOULD BE THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ARGUMENTS THAT YOU MADE RIGHT RIGHT SO ABSOLUTELY AND AND THE QUESTION ACTUALLY COMES DOWN TO WHAT IS THE MARGINAL AFFECT OF AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR ABOUT REACH RIGHT. HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE COUNT WITH AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR HOURS -- HONESTLY I THINK THAT THAT QUESTION IS NOT ANSWERABLE FROM OUR ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WE NECESSARILY WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER WITH ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS REALLY. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ASK COMPLETE COUNT TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO I'M SORRY YOUR ASKED. TO COMPLETE COUNT. THE ODD THE AGENCY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF DOING OUTRAGE IS MISSING OKAY THANK YOU MR ROTH. HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE MICROPHONE. THE TENS OF MILLIONS TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IS THAT A YEAR OR IS OUT OF THE DECADE. THAT IS A YEAR BUT IT OULD DECLINE OVER THE DECADE BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT BUT OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTED WAS THAT A LOT OF PROGRAMS WHILE THEY'RE NOT BASED ON THE DECENNIAL CENSUS. IN THE YEAR THAT THE CENSUS OCCURRED SO SAY IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDING FORMULAS WILL BE BASED ON THAT TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS BUT THERE AFTER -- THEIR FORMULAS WILL USUALLY RELY ON THE ANNUAL POPULATION COUNTS WHICH ARE BASED ON SURVEYS. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- SO THE ANNUAL HOUSING SURVEY OR THE COMMUNITY POPULATION SURVEY AND THE AND THE AFFECTS OF THE UNDERCOUNT WOULD SOLELY A ROAD OVER TIME AS BIG AS THE ACTUAL DECENNIAL CENSUS IS NO LONGER USED AS PART OF THOSE FUNDING FORMULAS. SO TENS OF MILLIONS TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. A YEAR DECLINING OVER THE DECADE THAT THE CENSUS COVERS THAT'S RIGHT. I'M SURE YOU SAID THIS AND I MISSED IT BECAUSE I WAS IN AND OUT BUT WHAT'S THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT'S PROJECTED TO BE SPENT BY THE STATE ON THE CENSUS EFFORT. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN MILLION INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE CLOSER TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION UNDER THE HOUSES. THANK YOU THINK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SIR MORE LIFE. REDISTRICTING IS A SORT OF THIS CAN BE A TOPIC FOR WANT SERVICES ONLY COMES UP EVERY TEN YEARS BUT SOME PEOPLE REALLY. SPECIALIZE IN IT SO I'M JUST WONDERING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS DONE. AN ANALYSIS OF SAY THE LAST FOUR CYCLES. HOW MUCH WAS SPENT? WHAT COULD BE? CALCULATED IS IS AS HAVING BEEN MAYBE THE PERCEIVED BENEFIT. IT JUST. SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE WOULD WANT TO BE INTERESTED IN THAT THAT IS IS IS THAT AVAILABLE -- YES IT IS AN AIRPORT I'M NOT GONNA HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I WILL SAY THE AMOUNT THAT WAS SPENT IN THE LAST TWO SENTENCES CENSUSES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE AMOUNT THAT IS BEING PROPOSED THIS YEAR -- I BELIEVE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIVE MILLION BY STATE MONEY IN -- TWENTY TEN BUT THAT WAS COUPLED WITH ACTUALLY A LOT OF PRIVATE MONEY EYES THIS IS TO ON A LOT OF THE PROPOSALS ARE. FOR PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ALSO HAVE -- MONEY INVOLVED AND THEN IN. TWO THOUSAND I BELIEVE CAROLINE SHE RELIGIOUSLY MALES OFFICE I BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND THERE IS ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS APPROPRIATED FOR THE CENSUS BUT I I THINK YOUR QUESTION I SENATOR HAD TO DO WITH REDISTRICTING WHICH IS A SEPARATE PROCESS -- RIGHT. THE CENSUS INFORMS THE STATE'S REDISTRICTING PROCESS BUT THERE IS A SEPARATE APPROPRIATION THAT OCCURS TO PAY FOR THAT THAT PROCESS THAT WAS. ESTABLISHED THROUGH THROUGH A PROPOSITION AND BUT I'M NOT SURE MAYBE YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT BOTH WELL BEHIND OR EVERY SEE THE CENSUS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THE REDISTRICTING AS WELL BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE ALSO GETTING YOUR POPULATION NUMBERS FOR YOUR FUNDING. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S AROUND REAL BOB SO THIS IS. MY SECOND TIME THROUGH ONE OF THESE -- WIT THE FIRST WAS AS A SUPERVISOR BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND GETTING READY FOR ALL THE FUN WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE SEWERS SO SINCE WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS THERE ARE YOU KNOW I FOUND AT THAT TIME THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE TO SPECIALIZE. THE KIND OF COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK EVERY TEN YEARS IN KINDA. YOU KNOW REALLY AREN'T THAT'S LIKE A HOBBY AND AND SO I'M I'M JUST SORT OF CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT WHAT IF WE DID WHAT WE LEARNED WHAT WE SPEND. YOU GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW AND AND WHY IF IT WOULD ONLY SPEND FIVE MILLION TO TEN MILLION. THE LAST TWO CYCLES WIRE TO WHITE WHITE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE PAST -- CENSUS OUT REACH EFFORTS BY THE STATE AND THEN THERE IS A SEPARATE APPROPRIATION PROCESS THAT IS SPELL AND AND FUNDING PROCESSES SPELLED OUT BY THE PROPOSITION FOR THE PURPOSES OF STATE REDISTRICTING AND HOW THAT PROCESS UNFOLDS -- THE YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS ARM THAT HAVE PROMPTED A LOT OF THE EMPHASIS ON OUTREACH -- INCLUDING RELYING ON FOLKS TO RESPOND -- VIA THE INTERNET PRIMARILY AND OTHER CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO THE SENSES AND I THINK THAT IT HAS BEEN A LOT OF WHY THE STATE HAS PUT SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON INCREASING OUTRAGE THIS YEAR. LET ME ALSO ADD THAT WALL AND THE LAST TWO SENSES WERE CONSIDERED VERY ACCURATE FROM A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE THERE WAS STILL AN UNDERCOUNT IN CALIFORNIA. AND ACTUALLY THAT HAS SORT OF THIS DOUBLE WHAMMY AFFECT FOR THE STATE WHERE IF YOUR ACCOUNTING EVERYONE ELSE ACCURATELY IN YOUR COUNTING CALIFORNIA LESS THAN THE HOUSE IMPLICATIONS FOR REDISTRICTING. ALSO THIS YEAR -- CALIFORNIA IS SORT OF FOR THE FIRST TIME AT RISK OF POTENTIALLY LOSING A SEAT AND SO THOSE MARGINAL DIFFERENCES IN POPULATION CAN MAKE A PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCE. IN TERMS OF GETTING ACCURATELY COUNTED. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE GONNA SPEND TEN TO TWENTY TIMES MORE THAN THE LAST CYCLE. SO I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT SPENDING IS NOT FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IN PARTICULAR IT IS FOR THE WHOLE RANGE OF MAKING SURE THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE SHOULD E ENTITLED TO UNDER OUR ACTUAL POPULATION. AND THEN AS LA -- MENTION BRIEFLY BUT A LOT BOTH IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND EVEN JUST THE GENERAL ALLOCATION OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING. IS OFTEN DEPENDENT ON THE CENSUS COUNT NOT SIMPLY THE STATE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES THAT DOES MATTER FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL SEAT AND DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL FUNDING ACROSS THE NATION BUT EVEN WITHIN THE STATE WHEN -- WE ARE DIRECTING RESOURCES OFTEN THOSE FORMULAS ARE DEPENDENT ON CENSUS COUNTS AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE BE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE NO NO I I FULLY UNDERSTAND IS A FORMER SUPERVISOR I FULLY GET IT. BUT I'M JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT THAT EXPERIENCE TO THIS. ONE JUST TRYING. TO YOU KNOW COMPARE THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT IS THE EVERY TEN YEARS WE LOOK AND SEE WHAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS TIME AND WHY. RIGHT AND SO I THINK LA A MENTION BUT WE DO BELIEVE IN THIS CASE -- THERE ARE SOME RISKS -- TO A PROPER COUNT THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN PREVIOUS CENSUS CYCLES. AND YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY IT AND IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS AMOUNT. WHAT IS AT STAKE IS A SERIOUS IS A SERIOUS MATTER? THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU CAN IT IS MY SENSE ALSO GIVEN THE EXTREME. NATURE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH PAST ADMINISTRATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S IN THE NEW POSSIBLE PUT FORWARD DOUBLE IMPACT THIS CENSUS COLLECTION EXPERIENCE. MISS SKINNER. TIME THANK YOU I WANTED TO ADD TO THAT THE THE REASONS -- DISCUSSED SO FAR HAVE BEEN -- THE LEGITIMATE IMPORTANT BUT I THINK WHAT. WAS AN ADDED IN THIS WERE COUPLE THINGS IF WE TAKE. TWENTY TEN COMPARE -- TO THIS YEAR -- WE'VE HAD A GROWTH A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. ON HOUSE TO PEOPLE. AND OUR OWN HOUSE TO PEOPLE JUST IN THE LAST TWO YEAR PERIOD NOT COUNTING FOR NINETEEN BUT ROSE BY 17%. ACROSS THE STATE SO WE KNOW THAT THAT FIGURE WAS EVEN HIGHER STE -- OVER THE TEN YEAR PERIOD THAT'S A POPULATION THAT IS VERY HARD TO COUNT. NOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE MONEY THAT WE LOSE IF WE UNDERCOUNT. IT IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF FUNDS THAT SUPPORT OUR MOST LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. THE RESIDENTS THAT WERE MOST LIKELY TO NOT BE COUNTED SO FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. INDEPENDENT OF IT THERE'S NO COMPARISON WITH PAST CENSUS. IN TERMS OF WHETHER THIS IS A LEGITIMATE EXPENDITURE NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC. WE HAVE MUCH MORE THE END DUE TO THAT MANY MORE PEOPLE THAT COULD BE UNDER COUNTY. AND BE A ON THAT UNDER COUNTING CAN RISK THE VERY FINDING THAT THAT POPULATION NEEDS SO WE HAVE ALL OF THAT AND THEN FINALLY. WE HAVE THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION HAVING GREATLY CUT BACK ON THE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR OUT OF REACH FOR THE CENSUS SO I THINK ALL OF THOSE REASONS TO JUSTIFY. INCREASED OF FULL VERY INCREASED EXPENDITURE ON THE PART OF CALIFORNIA. Q. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OFTEN. THANK YOU [inaudible] ISSUE.

SECOND ITEM ON THE TABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION GRANTS BY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN BOTH HOUSES APPROVED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE INFILL GRANT PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND DEVELOPERS CAN APPLY FOR THIS FUNDING ONE DIFFERENCES BUT ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IS THAT THE SENATE -- MADE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING ON BUT NOTS DID NOT SPECIFY THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS IN FUTURE YEARS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE UPCOMING ITEMS ON YOUR AGENDA.

A QUITE OFTEN WHAT WE SEE IN THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS IS THAT THE LARGER CITIES ARE BETTER ABLE TO COMPETE NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A NEED BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE SOPHISTICATED PLANNING STAFF. AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE TWO HUNDRED MILLION OF THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION SET ASIDE FOR SMALL AND RURAL CITIES. YOU SEE THE FUNDING YOU SUPPORTIVE OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING. THANK YOU.

ON IN THESE POSITIONS WOULD BE AT EACH CD AND WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHANGES MADE TO THE ARENA PROCESS THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS -- ALLOCATION PROCESS. THE SENATE -- APPROVED THE FUNDS IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND APPROVED A FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN -- TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT NOT MAKE BUT DID NOT MAKE THOSE FUNDS ON GOING TO TO THE DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT CHANGES TO THE READER PROCESS MOVING FORWARD THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FINANCE. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RAIN A PROCESS AND THE FACT THAT IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT ONGOING FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE AND SO WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. EXCELLENT OUT WITH THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE PREPARED -- TO HERE MOTION IN SUPPORT OF THE ASSEMBLY VERSION. EXCELLENT WITH A ROLL CALL FROM THE ASSEMBLY OF FIVE TWO ZERO FOUR TO ZERO AND THE SENATE VOTE OF THREE TO TWO I'M SORRY DID I NOT TO YOU. LET'S GO BACK -- TO ISSUE SIXTEEN MS SKINNER -- HAS A COMMENT -- THE COMMON I WANT TO MAKE WAS ON THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT THE SENATE IS RECOMMENDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. AND IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO COMPLETELY TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW. WHILE THE LEGISLATURE HOW I THINK HAS DONE THE EXACTLY APPROPRIATE THING WHICH IS -- TO TO BASICALLY -- MAKE IT MORE AVAILABLE UP AND DOWN THE STATE FOR PEOPLE TO DO THE EIGHTY USE THE EXCESS REDRAWING UNITS. WHAT WE FIND HAPPENS OFTEN IN THESE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS THAT PREDATORY LENDERS THEN START TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE AND THERE IS NOW EVIDENCE THAT? IN CLEARLY A LOW INCOME HOMEOWNER AND EIGHTY YOU IS VERY ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE IT CAN HELP THEM STAY IN THE HOME BY BRINGING IN SOME ADDITIONAL -- IN RENTAL INCOME BUT THEY MAY NOT BE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THEY CAN GET A TYPICAL -- EITHER REFI OR HOME EQUITY LOAN AND SO THEIR NEW PRODUCTS NOW BEING MARKETED TO LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE ALL OF THE HOMEOWNERS EQUITY. AND YOU KNOW BEING MARKETED IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT FULLY -- THAT THE HOMEOWNER DOESN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND SO AGAIN THIS INNOVATIVE TOOL FOR THE EXPANSION OF A PILOT UNDER THE CAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS. THAT ENTIRE PROBLEM IT AT LEAST WOULD GIVE. A LEGITIMATE FINANCING OPTION FOR LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN EIGHTY USE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVING BACK ON BACK TO ISSUE EIGHTEEN SUCCESSOR AGENCY DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT LA -- THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AUTHORIZING SUCCESSOR AGENCIES WERE FUNDING REMAINING FROM TWO THOUSAND A LOT ELEVEN BONDS ISSUED BY THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO YOUR REVIEWS THE REMAINING BOND PROCEEDS FOR PURPOSES RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND TO DIEM REMAINING PROPERTY RELATED TO ITS LONG RANGE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SURPLUS PROPERTY AND SELL IT TO NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPER OR HOUSING AUTHORITY TO BE USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE WOULD JUST NOTE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT ALLOWING SUCCESSOR AGENCIES USE THESE BRAUN PROCEEDS -- WOULD INCREASE STATE GENERAL FUND COSTS -- RELATIVE TO CURRENT LAW -- RELATED TO THE UNWINDING OF REDEVELOPMENT BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH FUN FUNDING WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE FOR USE BY SUCCESSOR AGENCIES THERE'S ALL THE TRAILER BILL AT THIS TIME THE GENERAL FUND COST. IS UNKNOWN. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CNSIDER WHAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT IT DESIRES OVER THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THE TRAILER BILL WOULD FIND. THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL WOULD DEFER SOME KEY POLICY CHOICES INCLUDING THE LOCATION CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PROJECTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. VARIOUS STATE PROGRAMS INCLUDING ONES WE DISCUSSED EARLIER INCLUDE LIKE THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM. AN INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM HELP FROM THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE ENVISIONED BY THIS TRAILER BILL. THESE PROGRAMS OF REGULATIONS AND OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS THAT PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH MORE CERTAINTY ABOUT THE HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED. THANK YOU FINANCE AND THE ADMINISTRATION SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LA -- AND THE ADMINISTRATION DOES SUPPORT THE SENATE PROPOSAL [inaudible] MEMBERS. WILL HOLD ITEM OPEN. MOVING ON NOW TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. RELATIONS BOARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. ISSUE NINETEEN INCLUDES VARIOUS LABOR ADJUSTMENTS. WE'LL START WITH THE LA -- THE CAT'S OWNER WITH THE LA L. ITEM NINETEEN INCLUDES FOR CONFERENCE ITEMS AT DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY I'LL GO THROUGH EACH OF THEM VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN -- TAKE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM -- THE FIRST ISSUE RELATES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS -- FOR THE SUBSEQUENT INJURY BENEFIT TRUST FUND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THIRTY POSITIONS AND FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND OF FOURTEEN POSITIONS AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING IN THE OUT YEARS TO ADDRESS WORKLOAD STE ISSUES -- FOR RELATED TO WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS FOR THE SUBSEQUENT INJURY BENEFIT TRUST FUND. ON THE SENATE ADOPTED THIS PROPOSAL AND THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S HOW YEAR OP FUNDING AND POSITIONS REQUEST SPECIFICALLY FOURTEEN POSITIONS AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. THE SECOND ITEM RELATES THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND SPECIFICALLY ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMOVING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT ACT WHICH IS AB ELEVEN ELEVEN OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AB ELEVEN ELEVEN IS A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM FOR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS -- THAT WAS BUDGETED ORIGINALLY AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED SIX MILLION PER SIX POSITIONS AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS. ARE FROM THAT FIFTEEN MILLION -- FOR ADMIN IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THE SENATE APPROVED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COST TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. THE BY WAY OF BACKSTORY AB ELEVEN ELEVEN THE LEGISLATION SELF INCLUDED A 5% CAP ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THIS PROGRAM. IN ARE GOING ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION THE THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATED THAT -- ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ABOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OVERSIGHT OF THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD ACTUALLY BE CLOSER TO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- QUITE IN EXCESS OF THE 5% CAP THAT WAS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE LEGISLATION AND SO THE REQUEST THIS YEAR WAS TO REDIRECT SOME OF THOSE LOCAL ASSISTANCE DOLLARS -- TO STAY OPERATIONS TO THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. THE THIRD ITEM ON THE AGENDA HERE RELATES TO DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND SPECIFICALLY -- TO UNPAID WAGE CLAIMS FOR GARMENT WORKERS -- THE GOVERNOR HAS NO PROPOSAL AND NOR DOES THE ASSEMBLY. BUT THE THE SENATE ADOPTED. A SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND TRANSFER TO THE GARMENT MANUFACTURERS SPECIAL ACCOUNT AND THIS ACCOUNT IS USED TO PAY ON PAID WEIGHTS CLAIMS FOR GOVERNMENT WORKERS WHEN THOSE. CLAIMS CAN'T BE RECOVERED FROM EMPLOYERS -- EACH YEAR GARMENT MANUFACTURERS MUST REGISTER WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND PART OF THAT REGISTRATION FEES GOES INTO THIS ACCOUNT IT'S USED TO PAY ON PAID WAGE CLAIMS -- BUT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THIS ACCOUNT HAS BEEN INSOLVENT BECAUSE OF AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE FEES COLLECTED EACH YEAR AND THE NUMBER OF WAGE CLAIMS THAT ARE COMING INTO THE ACCOUNT. ON BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE FROM LAST YEAR AUTHORIZED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TRANSFER FUNDS FROM A DIFFERENT WAY TO COUNT TO THIS SPECIFIC GARMENT ACCOUNT. TO COVER SOME OF THESE UNPAID WAGES -- BUT THE REMAINING BALANCE OUTSTANDING -- AT THIS TIME WAS SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND THE SENATE TOOK ACTION TO TRANSFER THAT DIRECTLY FROM THE GENERAL FUND -- AT ONE UPDATE IS THAT JUST LAST WEEK WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TRANSFERRED -- FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM A DIFFERENT WAY TO CLAIM ACCOUNT TO THE GARMENT MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNT MEANING THAT THE REMAINING UTSTANDING BALANCES PROBABLY SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN UNPAID WAGE CLAIMS. AS OPPOSED TO THE SEVEN POINT THREE IT WAS ADOPTED BY THE SENATE -- CAN FINALLY. THE SENATE ALSO ADOPTED SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO REASSESS THE FEE STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO SERVE RE BALANCE THAT THE SOLVENCY OF THIS FUND GOING FORWARD -- WE THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT DECISION AT PRESS TIME SWEET SUPPORT THE SENATE SRL -- THE THE DETERMINATION ABOUT WHETHER TO MAKE A GENERAL FUND TRANSFER FOR THESE WAYS CLAIMS HIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE OF OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY. ABOUT WHAT I'M SORRY THE LAST ITEM ON THIS ISSUE IS. FOR THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD SPECIFICALLY THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO PER -- AND THE SENATE TOOK NO ACTION ON THIS ITEM. OUR COMPROMISE RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO APPROVE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF AUGMENTATION SUPERB OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND THE LIMITED TERM FUNDING WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS WHAT THE LONG TERM NEEDS ARE. FOR THANK YOU FINANCE. ON THAT VERY LAST ISSUE THAT AWAY -- MENTIONED -- WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE SENATE ACTION WITH THAT SIR -- INSTEAD RATHER THAN THE COMPROMISE SUGGESTED BY A OVERALL IN THESE PROPOSALS -- THE ADMINISTRATION HE NEEDS TO HAVE SUPPORT IT'S MY REVISION PROPOSALS AND HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THEM. THANK YOU QUESTIONS MEMBERS SENATOR ROBB. THANK YOU MANAGER WITH RESPECT TO THE GARMIN MANUFACTURE SPECIAL CAT I I MISSED THE PART WHERE YOU TELL ME. HOW WE WERE GOING? TO DEAL WITH THE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE ON THE GO FORWARD. THE SENATE ACTION HAS ADOPTED IN SUB COMMITTEE SEEKS. TO DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO ANSWER THAT VERY QUESTION -- DID THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO REASSESS ITS FEE STRUCTURE -- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THAT FUND IS SOLVING GOING FORWARD TO PAY FOR BOB BENEFITS THAT THAT. ARE FOR APPROVED CLAIMS THAT COME IN EACH YEAR AS WE CLEARLY HAVE A PROBLEM. THE FUND HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN FOR SEVERAL YEARS-- THE STATE OPERATES SEVERAL UNPAID WAGE FUNDS AND SO THERE'S BEEN SOME FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THOSE SORT OF CUMULATIVE FUND STRUCTURES TO TRANSFER FUNDS ACROSS -- SPECIFICALLY FROM A ANOTHER FUND THE UNPAID WAGE FUND TO THE GARMENT FUND FOR THIS PURPOSE -- BUT IT APPEARS AT THIS POINT THAT THOSE TRANSFERS ARE NOW LIMITED -- GIVEN THE RESOURCES REMAINING IN THE EXISTING OTHER FUNDS ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THE SOLUTION THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M SURE THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AYE. WE'LL CONFUSED ABOUT THE SUBSEQUENT INJURY BENEFIT TRUST FUND. A PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT ORIGINALLY THE ADMINISTRATION HAD PROPOSED SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HAVE A LINE SOME OF THE STATUTES. FOR THE S. I. B. T. F. WITH OTHER WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND I WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING LONG TERM LIABILITIES AND THAT PROGRAM IS SET. BY THOSE IS A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE STILL PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. HI DANIEL BRANDON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOW WE PULLED THE TRAILER BILL AND AROUND EARLY MAY -- LATE APRIL AND WE WANTED TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT SOME WORK ON IT A LITTLE BIT MORE WE HAD SOME ISSUES. OKAY SO THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THIS YEAR BUT DO ANTICIPATE MAYBE AND NEXT YEAR THAT IT'LL BE. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TO WHAT WILL BE ABLE TO DO NEXT YEAR BUT IT IS NOT PART OF THIS YEAR OKAY PAUL I MEAN TALKING ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS THAT. THE PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY NEEDS ATTENTION I THOUGHT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AT AREA MADE A LOT OF SENSE WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT LANGUAGE WITHDRAWN. WHAT'S MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE GARMENT MANUFACTURER SPECIAL ACCOUNT THANKS FOR THE HISTORY -- SOMETHING HAPPENED WAGE STAFFED. SO WE DECIDED. OUR PREDECESSORS DECIDED TO ASSESS. OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT INDUSTRY. AND THOSE FUNDS WOULD GO INTO THIS ACCOUNT IN THAT WE WOULD PAY. THOSE THAT LOST WAGES FROM THE BAD ACTORS IN THAT INDUSTRY -- SO I'M JUST NOW THE BALLOTS FALLING SHORT SO. IS IT BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY IS DWINDLING. OR THE FEE IS TOO LOW. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND BACK A MATERIAL PROVIDED AS PART OF THE PROPOSAL -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT OF THE FEE STRUCTURE IS STATUTORY SO IT'S NOT CHANGING WITH INFLATION ODD TO ACCOUNT. FOR THE STATE THE INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE SO WE'VE SEEN LAST EARLIER SO THAT'S ON THE THE REVENUE SIDE THERE'S IT'S STATIC. N. ON THE ON THE CLAIM SIDE CLAIMS ARE MORE VALUABLE FOR THAT SAME REASON -- INCREASED WAGES BUT ALSO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS COMING IN EACH YEAR HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS SO THE THE TOTAL SORT OF DRAW FOR LACK OF A BETTER PHRASE ON THE MANUFACTURE SPECIAL COUNT IS LARGER -- IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS A HAS BEEN THAN IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY. AND IN THE CLAIMS ARE RESULT OF BUSINESSES CLOSING AND LEAVING. AND NOT MAKING THE FINAL PAYCHECK. THAT THAT'S CORRECT GENERALLY -- THERE ARE SEVERAL INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR WHICH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AS HAVE DEVELOPED SPECIAL ACCOUNTS FOR UNPAID WAGES -- AND GARMENT WORKERS IN GOVERNMENTAL FRACTURES IS ONE OF THOSE BECAUSE OF THE LIKELY HARDER OR RELATIVELY HIGH PROBABILITY THAT A WAGE CLAIM IS ON RECOVERABLE FROM THE EMPLOYER. SO WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT. IS BARELY MAKING IT. AND WE'RE CHARGING THEM MORE TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THAT. DIDN'T MAKE IT -- I'M I'M WONDERING WHAT THE OVERALL PHILOSOPHY IS. HOW MANY INDUSTRIES ARE WE DOING THIS? FOR BURKE REGARDING THE PHILOSOPHY ADDING I WOULD DEFER TO THE ADMINISTRATION -- I RECALL THERE ARE THERE IS A FARMWORKERS WHICH FUND A CAR WASH WHICH FUND THIS WAY TO FUND AND MAY BE FORGETTING A COUPLE OF OTHERS -- BUT SPECIFIC TO INDUSTRIES ARE THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOW WAGE AND WHICH WHICH OUR VIOLATIONS ARE COMMONLY OCCURRING. AND AGAIN ON ALL OF THOSE AS I RECALL THE RICH FEE IS APPLIED TO EVERY MANUFACTURER SO SPREAD ACROSS. THE BOARD RIGHT WELL THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL IT ISN'T JUST THOSE IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GIVE A HOTEL ALL FOR THIS FUN IT'S ALL. GARMENT MANUFACTURERS IT IS IT IS THE SPECIFIC IMMEDIATE EVERYBODY INVOLVED GARMENT MANUFACTURERS VOTE I GOT THE IMPRESSION FROM YOUR QUESTION THAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS JUST APPLY EVEN TO A SUBGROUP OFF THE BOARD YOU KNOW YOU'RE HELPING WE ARE LOOKING AT JUST THE GARMENT INDUSTRY BUT I'M. MY READING OF THE BUSINESS PAGES SHOWING ME THAT. CARMEN. RELATED BUSINESSES ARE FAR LEAVING THE STATE SO YOUR YOUR POOL OF POTENTIAL REGISTRATION FEE. INCOME PROVIDERS IS DWINDLING AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE. PEOPLE TO PAY WE MADE THAT COMMITMENT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY THAT. YOU KNOW THAT VIEWS YOU SUFFERED. THEFT. WE ARE WE DON'T WE DON'T REIMBURSE EVERYBODY ELSE HAD A THEFT RIGHT TO THIS KIND OF A UNIQUE. STORY SO I'M I'M I'M WORRIED ABOUT. THE THE THE REAP REVERBERATIONS OF ONE IS OKAY WHO WHO ELSE IS GOING TO COME AND AS FOR FUND AND WHO DO WE CHARGE AND AN END OUR WINNER I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T GIVE A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO THE TERM GLOBE IS. RIGHT EITHER GOING. YOU KNOW OF AND SO WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE HOW WE DO THIS SO I I I UNDERSTAND THE COMPASSIONATE I UNDERSTAND. PAYING SOME OF THESE PEOPLE BUT I ALSO. YOU KNOW JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER SO THAT WE'RE NOT DISINCENTIVE RISING GARMENT. PRODUCERS FROM. OPENING PLANTS OR WHATEVER HERE IN THE STATE. THANK YOU I'M GONNA GO -- TO SIR TO ROCK AND THEN AND FINANCE ARE ELLIE -- COULD CLARIFY THE POINT YOU MADE IN TERMS OF THE ROLE OF D. I. R. IN TERMS OF IN DEEP PROVIDING PROTECTIONS TO ALL EMPLOYEES WHO ARE VICTIM OF WAIT STAFF SO THERE. THERE IS A BROADER ANSWER ALL AND WORKERS ARE COVERED BUT SENATOR RON FIRST. WELL I'D PROBABLY FORGOTTEN. WHAT IT WHAT I KNEW IF I KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BUT WHAT I DO RECALL? IS THAT HISTORICALLY THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY HAS SO. RECEIVED A SPECIAL AMOUNT OF ATTENTION IN THE LABOR CODE DUE TO PROBLEMS HISTORICALLY WITH IDENTIFYING WHO THE EMPLOYERS WERE -- AND PROVIDING THE PROPER DOCUMENTATION SO EMPLOYEES KNEW WHO TO CLAIM AGAINST. TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE PICKING UP -- LABELS OFF THE FLOOR AND TAKING THEM TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. SO THERE THERE UNLIKE OTHER EMPLOYMENT VENUES THIS PARTICULAR EMPLOYMENT VENUE HAS RECEIVED. A FOR AMOUNT OF ATTENTION WAS SOME JUSTIFICATION BASED ON PAST BEHAVIOR -- IN THE LABOR CODE TO APPARENTLY TO INCLUDE THE SPECIAL FUND KNOW WHY THE FUND HAS A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT I DON'T KNOW I LOOK FORWARD. TO SOMEONE COMING UP WITH THE SOLUTIONS OR NOT HAVING DEFEATED FROM THE GENERAL FUND. BUT THE INDUSTRY ITSELF I ASSUME RECOGNIZED. THE INDUSTRY HAD A PROBLEM AND NEED TO CLEAN ITSELF UP -- HENCE THE HAS THE THE GENESIS FOR THE REGISTRATION FEE IN THE ASSESSMENT [inaudible] THIRTY NIELSEN. WHAT IS IT THAT FORMER ISSUE OF THE? DOCUMENT THAT OUR STAFF DID HAVE IN POSSESSION BUT WAS FOUND ON YOUR WEBSITE. THE ITEM WE WERE TALKING ABOUT JUST BEFORE THIS LAST. ONE THERE WAS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WAS POSTED ON YOUR WEBSITE AND NOW IT'S GONE. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS AS HOW IT GOT GONE [inaudible] IN [inaudible] THE SOMEBODY JUST LOSE IT. YOU KNOW WHAT. LET'S JUST SAY YOU ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT SUSPICIOUS AROUND HERE OVER THE YEARS AND IF IT WAS PROPERLY BEFORE US. THEN IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REMOVED. FROM THE PURVIEW OF THE COMMITTEE WITHOUT AN ACTION OF THE COMMITTEE. IT COULD NOT BE BUSH MOVE REMOVE UNILATERAL. NOW CAN YOU TRACE SET BACK AND PRODUCE THAT DOCUMENT. ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN DANIELLE IF YOU WANT TO ADD INCOMES AS WELL AS PART OF THE DEVELOPER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- WE PROPOSE TRAILER BILLS -- WHICH ARE POSTED ONLINE AND THEN WHEN WE HAVE THIS TAYLOR BILLS UP THERE ANYONE GLASSES THAT AND DOES SO WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. ONCE THE GOVERNOR IN THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDED THAT WE WANTED TO THINK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE WENT MORE AND NOT PUT THAT OUT THERE. AS OUR PROPOSAL AND THEN WE DECIDED TO TAKE IT DOWN FROM THE WEBSITE SO THAT NO ONE WOULD THINK OTHERWISE CERTAINLY NOTHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT IT WE HOPE. WELL LAW REVIEW THE DOCUMENT THAT WE HAVE AND SHE IS AN ALL RAISE THE ISSUE AGAIN I'D LIKE TO LEAVE IT OPEN FOR TODAY THAT. WITH THAT OUT WE WILL LEAVE THE ITEM OFTEN IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. WITHOUT WHICH COULD BE SEEN NONE. YES WE ARE [inaudible] THE THAT'S RIGHT MOVING ON TO ISSUE TWENTY PAID FAMILY LEAVE UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT LA JOH. WILL WE HAVE A BLUE HAND OUT I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE IT BEFORE YOU IF NOT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL COPIES FOR THIS ITEM -- IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED I PLAN OR AN INTENTION TO X. LENGTH AND THE DURATION OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN THE STATE FROM ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF SIX WEEKS. TO TWELVE WEEKS PER PER PARENT IN THIS CASE -- THE GOVERNOR ALSO ANNOUNCE SOME OTHER OPTIONS THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN PURSUING OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR I INCLUDING ADDING SOME FLEXIBILITY TO THE STATE'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. OUT REDUCING THE THE RESERVE REQUIREMENT FOR THE FUND THAT PAYS PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS -- AS WELL AS CONVENING A TASK FORCE TO THINK ABOUT OTHER CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A FUTURE. FUTURE SET OF CHANGES. AROUND THE TIME IN A REVISION THE GOVERNOR RELEASED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE LAYING OUT FOR THE FIRST STEP OF OF THIS PLAN -- OUR HAND OUT ACROSS THE TOP OUR CHARACTERIZES THE THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THAT TOP ROW -- BEGINNING FROM THE LEFT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO LENGTHEN THE DURATION FOR THE BUDGET YEAR FROM ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS. AS WELL AS REDUCE THE RESERVE REQUIREMENT FOR THE FUND THAT PAYS BENEFITS. THE GOVERNOR ALSO ANNOUNCED LEGISLATIVE INTENT IN THE TRAILER BILL TO CONVENE A TASK FORCE TO STUDY FURTHER CHANGES. AND INCLUDES OUR POSITIONS AND SOME FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE LENGTHENING OF THE DURATION AS WELL AS TO UNDERTAKE SOME OUTREACH ACTIVITIES TO INCREASE AWARENESS. ON IN THE NEXT COLUMN DOWN YOU'LL SEE THE SENATE ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL -- BUT IT ALSO ADOPTED A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SEPARATE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THE SPECIFIC MEMBERSHIP. AND SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE TASK FORCE LOOKING INTO PAID FAMILY LEAVE. ON THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND INSTEAD DEFERRED THESE POLICY QUESTIONS TO THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY PROCESS -- IT'S SIMILARLY REJECTED THE POSITIONS RELATED TO IMPLEMENTATION BUT DID APPROVE THE OUT REACH FUNDING FOR THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. ON A OF A FEW COMMENTS FROM OUR OFFICE ONE THING WE WANTED TO POINT OT WAS IT ALL THREE ACTIONS ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEED FOR FURTHER WORK AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE -- THERE ARE MANY POLICY OPTIONS QUESTIONS OUTSTANDING IN EACH OF THE THREE ACTIONS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY DO TAKE DIFFERENT APPROACHES THOUGH. ON IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE ACTIONS RELATED THIS ITEM WE SEE THEM AS AMPLIFYING THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN DETERMINING POLICY FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE GOING FORWARD BOTH OPTIONS WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE. A STRONGER. POSITION TO DETERMINE THE POLICIES GOING FORWARD FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE. ON THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES IS THAT THE SENATE ACTION ADOPTS THE LENGTHENING OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THE ASSEMBLY ACTION DOES NOT -- THE ASSEMBLY ACTION IN DEFERRING THESE QUESTIONS TO THE THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS WOULD ALLOW SOME FURTHER TIME FOR DELIBERATION ABOUT WHETHER TO LENGTHEN THE DURATION OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE. AND WE BRING THAT UP BECAUSE IN AN IN AN EARLIER REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE PUT OUT EARLIER THIS YEAR. ONE OF THE MAIN CONSIDERATIONS WE HOPED -- TO RAISE FOR THE LEGISLATURE WAS THIS NOTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD THINK CLEARLY ABOUT WHAT IT HOPES TO GET OUT OF FAMILY LEAVE. BECAUSE IT'S GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM REALLY DO DRIVE THE POLICY OPTIONS IT MIGHT WANT TO EXPLORE. ON FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO CHANGE PAID FAMILY LEAVE LENGTHENING THE DURATION IS BUT ONE OF THOSE WAYS YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE SETS THE AMOUNT OF OF BENEFIT. THE WEEKLY BENEFIT THAT THAT -- PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS GET DURING PAID FAMILY LEAVE YOU CAN LOOK AT FINANCING -- CONSIDERATION FOR THE PROGRAMMER OPTIONS TO MAKE IT MORE FLEXIBLE THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF POLICY OPTIONS -- AND NOT JUST LENGTHENING [inaudible] ON WE THINK WE AT THIS POINT VOTE THE MAIN QUESTION BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS WHETHER IT'S CONFIDENT THAT LENGTHENING LEAVE FROM SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS WILL BE PART OF ITS ULTIMATE PACKAGE OF REFORMS FOR THIS PROGRAM. IF SO -- THE SENATE ACTION TO ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO GO TO EIGHT WEEKS AT THIS TIME MAY BE THE RIGHT CHOICE. IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE LEGISLATURE BELIEVES FURTHER DELIBERATION ABOUT WHETHER IT'S WILL GO FROM SIX WEEKS EIGHT WEEKS -- IT'S REQUIRED -- THE ASSEMBLY ACTION MAY BE THE BEST CHOICE AT THIS TIME [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ITS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL AND BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS NIELSEN [inaudible] HI. THE MORE I HEAR [inaudible] ELEVATED CONCERNS. IN IT DOES APPEAR TO ME THIS IS FAR BETTER DEALT WITH IN A POLICY COMMITTEE. IN A POLICY BILL. RATHER THAN SLIPPED IN THE BUDGET THAT HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE HERE THAT SEEMS TO INDICATE. NO BIG CONSEQUENCES BUT I CAN'T QUITE ACCEPT THAT [inaudible] AB SO. MY OWN POSITION WOULD BE TO OPPOSE THIS LANGUAGE. LAST WEEK IT WOULD FOR A WEBER PREFERRED THAT WE PUT IT OVER. NOT TO CONSIDER IT IN THE BUDGET BUT CONSIDERED AND A SEPARATE BILL. IN A FULL POLICY COMMITTEE HEARING. AND IF NOT THEN I'LL SIMPLY VOTE NO. THANK YOU SIR MR OBERNOLTE. A QUESTION FOR THE LA -- SO. THE PROPOSAL HERE IS TO REDUCE THE RESERVE REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT ACCOUNT AND I'M WONDERING IF THE LA -- FEELS LIKE THAT REDUCTION IS WARRANTED AND WHETHER OR NOT. THE ACCOUNT WOULD STILL BE SUSTAINABLE WITH THE REDUCED RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. OF COURSE SO -- AS PART OF REVIEWING THE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL WE DID LOOK INTO THIS VERY QUESTION THE CURRENT RESERVE REQUIREMENT -- STIPULATES THAT ABOUT 40% OF EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFITS IN THE COMING YEAR 45% EXCUSE ME SHOULD BE KEPT ON HAND SUCH THAT BENEFITS CAN BE PAID OUT OF THE THE STATE'S DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PART OF THE THE MADE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSES TO REDUCE THAT REQUIREMENT FROM 45% 230%. I'M OUR OFFICE. LOOKED BACK AT HISTORICAL DATA SENSE THE STATE'S DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND WAS ENACTED DECADES AGO. AND FOUND THAT. IT WOULD BE VERY UNLIKELY FOR BENEFIT DISBURSEMENTS SO PAYMENTS OUT IN ANY GIVEN YEAR TO EXCEED WHAT WAS DISBURSING THE PRIOR YEAR BY MORE THAN 30%. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF COPY ODDS -- ONE WOULD BE THAT A MAJOR POLICY CHANGE FOR ENACTED THAT COULD EXCEED Y MORE THAN 30% IF BENEFITS WERE INCREASED -- THE THE THE OTHER -- AS AT THE OBVIOUSLY THE PAST DOESN'T ALWAYS DICTATE OR TELL US EXCLUSIVELY WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE -- BUT THE THE SORT OF IT BOILS DOWN -- TO WE BELIEVE THAT REDUCING THE RESERVE REQUIREMENT FROM 45% 230% WASN'T -- PUTTING THE FUND AT RISK OF BECOMING INSOLVENT OR THE RESERVE AT RISK OF BEING -- DEPLETED IN THE FUTURE ALL RIGHT SO JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THOUGH. CHANGING THE RESERVE REQUIREMENTS I JUST A SHORT TERM ACTION. ABOUT THE LONG TERM THE SOLVENCY OF THE FUND DEPENDS ON THE FUND BEING REPLENISHED BY. CONTRIBUTIONS THAT EMPLOYEES MAKE THROUGH THE STI. PAYCHECK BOB DEDUCTION AND SO THIS QUESTION NUMBER TWO IS WITH THE PROVISION OF THIS ADDITIONAL FAMILY LEAVE. RESULT IN A HIGHER SD I CONTRIBUTION RATE FOR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES. IT WOULD YES ON THE STATE'S PAYROLL TAX THAT FUNDS THE STI FUND -- IS CAPPED AT ONE POINT THE FIRST HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CURRENTLY THE RATE IS ABOUT 1% TO FUND BENEFITS. BUT BENEFITS. FUNDED WITH THIS RAY ARE BOTH FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND THE STATE'S SHORT TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM AND THE SHORT TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE IS ACTUALLY ABOUT 85% OF BENEFITS AGO OUT O IT'S A MUCH LARGER PART OF THE FUND. SUCH THAT A CHANGE. AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED GOING FROM SIX WEEKS EIGHT WEEKS THOUGH IT WOULD INCREASE BENEFITS -- WOULDN'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AFFECT ON THE PAYROLL TAX RATE WE THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY RESULT IN THAT THE AN INCREASE OF ABOUT. ONE TENTH OF 1% CERTAIN GOING FROM ONE POINT 1%. IN ORDER TO FUND THE PROPOSED BENEFITS GOING FORWARD. OKAY BUT YOU PUT IT THAT WAY I MEAN I I WOULD SAY THAT IS A MATERIAL CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S YOUR INCREASING THAT PAYROLL TAX BY 10%. AND AND FOR FORGIVE. MY USE OF THE WORD NOT NOTABLE OR HOW I CHARACTERIZED THAT OF COURSE THAT'S NOTABLE. THE VAST MAJORITY THE STATE'S WORKFORCE PAYS THIS PAYROLL TAX -- IN THE CONTEXT OF SPUR MEANING UNDER THE ONE POINT 5% CAP -- THERE THERE WILL BE IMMEDIATE CONCERN THAT THAT THE PAYROLL TAX WOULD INCREASE ABOVE THAT AMOUNT -- BUT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT TO THE FEDERAL TAX WOULD INCREASE OKAY AND AND I CAN TRY TO REMEMBER THE IS THERE A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ANNUAL PAY THAT THE STI IS ASSESSED HONORS ITS EVERYTHING UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT I BELIEVE IT'S THIS YEAR EVERYTHING UNDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT AMOUNT INCREASES WITH THE STATE'S AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE -- SO IT DOES INCREASE FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT OKAY SO FOR SOMEONE MAKING SAY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT TENTH OF 1% WOULD BE ANOTHER FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR THE EVERY CALIFORNIAN WOULD PAY. BUT THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN WOULD PAY -- TO GET THIS BENEFIT. THAT APPEARS TO BE ROUGHLY ACCURATE. SIR MORE LIVE. THE MANAGER JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON ON THAT DISCUSSION -- IN THE LA -- REPORT WE DON'T HAVE LIKE A HISTORY OF HOW THE RESERVES BEEN DOING THIS INSURANCE FIND OUT. HOW MUCH IS GOING IN EVERY YEAR HOW MUCH IS GOING OUT? IT WAS FOR DISABILITIES SAID IT WAS 1% OF ALL WAGES AT ONE POINT -- SO. DO WE HAVE AN ANALYSIS BECAUSE IF EVERYONE'S CHIPPING AND THEY SHOULD GET A STOCKHOLDERS REPORT OUT. OF A THING. THE ARE THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WHICH OVERSEES THE FUND DOES ISSUE -- ANNUAL FUND FORECAST WHICH INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF DISBURSEMENTS GOING OUT AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF COLLECTIONS FROM THE PAYROLL TAX. INCLUDING ALSO THE RESERVE AND PRINT AMOUNT PROJECTED FOR THE FORTHCOMING YEAR THAT THAT WOULD KEEP THE FUND IN SORT OF ITS RESERVE POSITION. HAVE YOU DONE ACTUARIAL STUDY. TO SEE HOW. THIS THIS TWO WEEK EXTENSION WOULD. WHAT IMPACT THAT THE FUND BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A? BIG SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION IT'S GONNA TAKE PARENTAL LEAVE RIGHT SO IT'S AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PORTION OF THE FUND IS ABOUT 15% OF BENEFITS THAT ARE DISPERSED SO IS THE MINORITY -- BUT THE THE FUND IS IS. THROUGH THE I SHOULD SAY THE PAYROLL TAX RATE EACH YEAR IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE BALANCE OF OP DISBURSEMENTS EXPECTED TO BE PAID OUT AS WELL AS COLLECTIONS FROM THE PAY THE THE PAYROLL TAX SO. IN ESSENCE A FORMULA SETS THE THE PAYROLL TAX RATE EACH YEAR IN ORDER TO KEEP THE RESERVE AND THE ACCOUNT AND BALANCE. SO IT ISN'T AS A STRAIGHT ONE POINT 5% ANYMORE IT'S IT IT FLUCTUATES EVERY YEAR THAT'S RIGHT IT FLUCTUATES EVERY YEAR IT'S CAPPED AT ONE POINT 5% IN UNDER. CURRENT LAW THIS YEAR IT IS 141% BUT WE DON'T NEED TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES TO DO THE ESTIMATES RIGHT. LITTLE JOKE CHAIR FROM YESTERDAY'S DISCUSSION. HA HA HA. OKAY I I I THINK WE NEED TO DO A MARKETING. WE GET IT. EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR THINGS WITH IN THE SALON WHICH FELL THANK YOU MANAGER. WELCOME MISTER MCCARTY. THANK YOU. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY IS TWO FOLD. TO ON FAMILY PAID FAMILY LEAVE WHICH I THINK THERE'S GREAT SUPPORT FOR IN THE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA HELPING. KNOWLEDGE IS FAMILIES AND WORKING MOTHERS AND THEN THE OUT THE OUTCOMES OF A YOUNG CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE ALL ALL FALL IN FOR THAT. SO IT'S TO EXTEND THE PERIOD TIME. AT AND ALSO TO HELP PAY FOR THAT ADDRESSING THE AMOUNT IN THE RESERVE RIGHT SIMPLIFIED. AND SO THEN YOU ALSO WANT TO SET UP THIS. TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT THESE OTHER POLICY CHANGES. AND AND THERE IS ONE OUT THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW SO MY QUESTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION. IS TO FOCUS ON THAT WORKERS WHO MAKE LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS 41100% WAGE. REPLACEMENT AND WANTED TO ASK FINANCE HAS THAT BEEN IN YOUR CALCULATION SO FAR AND WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND WAS THAT AT ALL PART OF THE POTENTIAL PROPOSAL WHEN YOU WROTE THIS OUT IN JANUARY. SO RIGHT NOW OUR APPROACH IS -- DEFERRING A QUESTION LIKE THAT TO THAT TO THE PROPOSED TASK FORCE SAID THE ONE PROPOSAL AS YOU NOTED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS READY TO GET BEHIND THAT WE BELIEVE WE CAN GET BEHIND. GIVEN THE CURRENT RESERVES IN THE FIND WAS EXTENDING FROM SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS. IN TERMS OF QUESTIONS BEYOND THAT WHETHER IT IS EXTENDING THAT WE DON'T WANT BEYOND EIGHT WEEKS WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID IS A GOAL OR INCREASING ANY PAY LEVELS WERE DEFERRING THOSE QUESTIONS. TO THE TASK FORCE AND WE KNOW -- TO THE DISCUSSION THAT WAS GOING ON THAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE BOUND UP WITH HOW WE CAN PAY FOR THOSE OVER THE LONG TERM. BY SUMA IT'S A TRADE OFF THEY PROBABLY. HAVE THE EQUAL VALUES THOMAS WAS THINGS COST AND SO IN YOUR EYES THAT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT IS IS TO EXTEND THE PERIOD. PEOPLE WOULD GET THE BENEFIT AS OPPOSED. TO INCREASE THE BENEFIT. SO I WOULDN'T PUT IT THAT WAY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION -- I THINK WHAT WALL WITH THAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP WE'RE TAKING JUST SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT FULLY SOLVE THE ISSUES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THAT YOU CARE ABOUT AND ARE ALL WORKING ON ALL THOSE QUESTIONS REQUIRE. A LOT OF THOUGHT AND WE'RE DIFFERENT ALL THOSE TO THE TASK FORCE. OKAY THANK YOU. WITH REGARD TO THE TASK FORCE ARE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT GIVEN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S HISTORY WITH PAID FAMILY LEAVE NATIONALLY AS A POLICY. ISSUE ON THAT IT WOULD BEHOOVE ALL OF US IF THE TASK FORCE HAD REPRESENTATION OR PARTICIPATION FROM THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE EITHER MEMBERS OR STAFF I NOTE I NOTICED THAT THAT THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED AT THIS POINT -- BUT GIVEN THE PARTNERSHIP WITH WHICH WE MUST FORAGE ON TO ADVANCE A POLICY THIS CUTTING EDGE IN CRITICAL I WOULD HOPE. THAT WE WOULD BE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE INCLUDED -- BECAUSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS CERTAINLY A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE PRO FAMILY POLICY ON THAT I THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ENGAGEMENT IN -- WOULD -- BE MEANINGFUL AND SIGNIFICANT. SO I HOPE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO DELIBERATE THIS ISSUE WE CAN BE INCLUDED WITH SKINNER. ECHO THAT COMMENT BY I HAVE A QUESTION ON JUST -- IF THIS WAS AN ADDRESS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS I DON'T HAVE THE HISTORY ON IT. AT WHAT POINT. THE WAS IT SAID THAT THE MAXIMUM T. TAXABLE WAGE LIMIT WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND IF THAT -- WAGE LIMITS WERE. RAISED ABOVE THAT WOULD THAT HELP OUR FUND BALANCE. SINCE WE HAVE PEOPLE RBC THAT HAVE WHICH IS HIGHER THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR. SENATOR SKINNER I'M NOT CERTAIN WHEN THAT CAP. WAS INSTITUTED AS A AS A POLICY COMPONENT I DO BELIEVE IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO IF NOT DECADES AGO IT HAS INCREASED WITH INFLATION OVER TIME. REGARDING YOUR SECOND POINT ABOUT. THAT BEING AN OPTION IT'S ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT THAT SORT OF WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONTEND WITH AND GRAPPLE WITH AS A DEVELOP ITS ALTERNATE POLICY GOALS FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE. INCREASING THAT AMOUNT -- OF THE CAP WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL -- COLLECTIONS FOR THE FUND WHICH COULD BE USED TO PAY FOR BENEFITS THAT'S ONE OPTION THAT THAT. THE LEGISLATURE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE TRUTH THINK THROUGH AS PART OF ITS ULTIMATE POLICY OPTIONS AND IS THAT K&lt;c.cyan&gt; WAS&lt;/c&gt; THAT DONE STATUTORY LAWYERS THAT THE TYPE OF CAP THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE ABILITY TO ADJUST. THAT CAP IS IN STATUTE OKAY BUT IT WAS POTENTIALLY DONE DECADES AGO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. AB FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION WILL BE THAT ITEM OPEN. ISSUE TWENTY ONE SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTIONS. FOR MENSTRUAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS AND DIAPERS. AGAIN ON THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. LA -- THANK YOU SIR CHRISTINE WITH THE LA SO WE HAVE A A BRIEF HANDOUT ON THIS ISSUE -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS ONE FOR CHILDREN'S DIAPERS AND ANOTHER ONE FOR MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD AUTHORIZE THESE EXEMPTIONS FOR TWO YEARS BEGINNING JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THE SENATE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHILE THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE EXEMPTIONS FOR TEN YEARS INSTEAD OF TWO THE LEGISLATURE FACES A TRADE OFF AND SETTING SUNSET DATES FOR TAX EXPENDITURES ON ONE HAND. A SHORTER SUNSET PROVIDES MORE FLEXIBILITY AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OVERSIGHT ON THE OTHER HAND A LONGER SUNSET PROVIDES MORE CERTAINTY FOR TAXPAYERS. AND ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO SPEND MORE OF ITS TIME ON OTHER ISSUES. IN LIGHT OF THAT TRADE OFF WE'RE RECOMMENDING A COMPROMISE THAT REFLECTS THE DIFFERENT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TWO EXEMPTIONS. SO FIRST ON THE DIAPER EXEMPTION WERE RECOMMENDING A SUNSET PERIOD OF I IN THE RANGE OF FORTY SIX YEARS WE VIEW THIS EXEMPTION AS ONE TOOL WITHIN A BROADER STRATEGY FOR PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PARENTS. AND THAT'S A STRATEGY THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADJUSTS PRETTY FREQUENTLY SO THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED BY FORTY SIX YEAR SUNSET COULD BE. QUITE VALUABLE -- SECOND FOR THE MINSTREL PRODUCTS EXEMPTION WE RECOMMEND AT A SUNSET OF EIGHT TO TEN YEARS -- THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED PRIMARILY ON AN EQUITY CONCERN AND SO THAT ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD BE GAINED FROM A SHORTER SUNSET IS NOT AS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT A TWO YEAR SUNSET BOTH FOR REASONS OF BUDGET RESILIENCY AND ALSO TO ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF THESE PROPOSALS. COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. SENATOR MORLOCK MADAME CHAIR. NINETEEN IS THIS A TOTAL SALES TAX EXEMPTION. THE ENTIRE EIGHT POINT 25%. OR IS IT JUST THE STATE PORTION. IT IS A TOTAL SALES TAX EXEMPTION -- WITH -- ONE DETAIL THAT -- TAKING GOING. TO CHIU CHAIRMAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO WE DO WE DO BELIEVE THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES US TO BACK FILL THE LOCAL REVENUE FROM -- TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE THE REALIGNMENT FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SO -- ARE TREATABLE Là IT DOES INCLUDE A BACK FILL. IN AT THAT WOULD GIVE THE CITY'S BACK THERE 1%. OF ITS ONE POINT. WHAT ONE END AND LITTLE MORE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VENTURE. INTO THE AIR FIVE DAYS SENATOR MALEK IT WOULD BE THAT THIS SHOULD BE THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT AMOUNT OF OF ONE POINT 0065% BECAUSE TO COUNTY ASSOCIATE WOULD NOT IT WOULDN'T AFFECT THE AMOUNT GOING CITIES. WITHIN THIS THE CITIES ARE ARE GOING TO BE LOSING THEIR REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF DIAPERS AND SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF TAKING A REVENUE SOURCE FROM THE CITY'S. AT ITS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT CALCULATES TO BUT BUT OUR CITIES AREN'T AREN'T. pBILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS THERE REALLY ENJOYING LAYOFFS AND CUTS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO PAY FOR HIGHER PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS ARMS TRYING. TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT WE'RE DOING TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT MAKING THEIR LIVES A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT? THANK YOU MATT BARRINGER. I DON'T KNOW THAT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. THE NUMBER THE WHOLE THAT ITEM OPEN [inaudible] WHICH ISSUE TWENTY TO FIFTY ITC EXPANSION IN ADVANCE PAYMENTS. BERMAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO THIS ISSUE INCLUDES SEVERAL ITEMS RELATED TO THE STATE'S EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. OR EITC. WHICH IS A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR LOW INCOME WORKERS AND I'LL BE REFERRING TO HAND OUT THAT SHOULD BE IN YOUR BINDERS -- THE SERGEANTS HAVE A COPY -- IF NOT -- SO FIRST I'M GONNA WALK THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAN TALK ABOUT TWO OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOUSES BUT I KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER DIFFERENCES THAT ALL ALL DRESSED. TO SO FROM THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO EXPAND THE STATE EITC IN THREE WAYS FIRST -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO INCREASE THE ATC BY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER FILER HER QUALIFIED WORK WORKERS WHO HAS AT LEAST ONE DEPENDENT CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF SIX AND SECOND REFERRING TO THE FIGURE ON PAGE -- ONE THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED TO EXTEND THE MAXIMUM INCOME FOR ESTABLISHING A LEGIT ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CREDIT. TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR ALL FILERS AND THIS COULD MAKE THE CREDIT AVAILABLE. I TALKED TO ONE MILLION NEW WORKERS. THIRD THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO CHANGE THE WAY THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT IS CALCULATED IN A WAY THAT WOULD INCREASE THE CREDIT AMOUNT. FOR INDIVIDUALS -- AND FAMILIES WITH EARNINGS AT THE HIGHER END OF THE ELIGIBILITY RANGE SO LOOKING AT THE FIGURE ON PAGE. ONE IT'S MOVING THE THE PHASE OUT SLIP BY SHIFTING THIS WILL REFER TO AS THE KING POINT TO THE LEFT -- THE IN THE IN THE PACKAGE THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSED A PLAN FOR PROVIDING. THE CREDIT IN ADVANCE MONTHLY PAYMENTS FOR FILERS WITH AN ESTIMATED CREDIT OF AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR -- THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR OUTREACH AND ALSO PROPOSED TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CREDIT TO THE CALIFORNIA EITC ACOSTA FLIPPING REFUND. CERTAINLY NOT A PITCH TO THE HAND OUT WE COMPARE THE DIFFERENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY EACH HOUSE TO EXPAND THE EITC STRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY. SO THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY BOTH ADOPTED THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. TOM HOWEVER BOTH HOUSES ALSO ACTED TO EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY TO WORKING TAX FILERS WHO DO NOT HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. BUT INSTEAD FILE THEIR TAX RETURNS. USING AN INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER WHICH WILL REFER TO AS AN I.. TEN AND NOW THE KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES WAS THAT THE ASSEMBLY REDUCED THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT FOR FILERS WITH A CHILD UNDER AGE. SIX SO THAT THE TOTAL COST. OF THERE IS A PROPOSED EXPANSION WOULD BE -- LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAX REVENUES OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT'S ONLINE TO OF THIS TABLE ON PAGE. TWO OF WHICH COMPARES TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SENATE ACTION. SO TURNING NOW TO PAGE THROUGH THE WINDOW. OF MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO PROVIDE MMHM -- ADVANCE MONTHLY PAYMENTS THE EIGHTY EIGHTY SEE. COULD -- POSSIBLY BE TREATED AS INCOME FOR THE PURPOSES OF FIGURING ELIGIBILITY AND BENEFIT LEVELS FOR OTHER PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS. AND BOTH HOUSES ARE SEEKING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THAT PLAN SO THE SENATE ACTION WAS TO REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S ADVANCE MONTHLY. PAYMENTS PROPOSAL AND THEY ADOPTED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT ISSUE. THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED HALF OF THE AMOUNT REQUESTED NINE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF AN ADVANCE MONTHLY PAYMENTS PLAN BUT THAT OUR MONEY IS CONTINGENT. OR PROVISIONAL ON THE RECEIPT OF A SIMILAR REPORT. SO IN ADDITION TO THESE ITEMS THERE SOME OTHER DIFFERENCES THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO ADMINISTER THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE. I TEN FILERS WHILE THE SENATE AND TAKEN IT -- SPECIFIC ACTION ON THAT I ISSUE. AND LASTLY WE NOTE THAT BOTH HOUSES AUGMENTED THE AMOUNT FOR OUTREACH BY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BRINGING THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOR OUTREACH TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS -- BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THESE ADOPTED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUDGET BILLING WHICH SO SPECIFICALLY THE SENATE ADDED LANGUAGE ABOUT FREE TAX PREPARATION SERVICES. WE DON'T HAVE A SET RECOMMEND SAID RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THESE DIFFERENCES -- AS THE SIZE OF THE EXPANSION WILL NEED TO DEPEND ON BALANCING YOUR COMPETING PRIORITIES. WE THINK THAT THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH OF BOTH HOUSES TO THE ADVANCE PAYMENTS PLAN IS REASONABLE AND EACH APPROACH HAS MERIT. YEAH -- IF YOU TO EXPAND THE CREDIT TIGHTENED FILERS THE SIMPLEST ACTION TO PROVIDE TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO FTP. OF FOR THE ADDITIONAL MINISTRY OF COST IS REASONABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ITS AY REVISION EITC PROPOSAL -- INCLUDING THE THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX AS WELL AS THE FUNDING FOR ADVANCE PAYMENTS WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. AND WE CONTINUE TO PLAY THAT TALKS CONFORMITY IS THE WAY TO PAY FOR THIS PROPOSAL ON AN ONGOING BASIS WHILE KEEPING THE BUDGET AND STRUCTURAL BALANCE. IN THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE -- FEDERAL APPROVED MEANT APPROVAL FOR THE ADVANCE PAYMENT OPTIONS SO WE DO AND SO -- THE WAY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE WE BEGIN ANY KIND OF ADVANCE PAYMENT PROPOSE. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS MR OBERNOLTE. QUESTION FOR THE PARMA FINANCE. HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION FEEL ABOUT THE ACTION TAKEN BY BOTH HOUSES TO EXTEND ELIGIBILITY TO I TEN FILERS? SO RIGHT NOW WE THAT -- PROPOSAL IS NOT IN OUR BUDGET AND AS WE'VE SEEN FROM THIS DISCUSSION LIKE ALL OF US -- WE'RE KEEPING A VERY CLOSE EYE ON THE OVERALL BUDGET RESILIENCY AND SO WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIT THAT WITHIN OUR PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. MISTER MOORE Là FOLLOWED BY MISS SKINNER. COULD YOU COULD YOU FURTHER EXPLAIN TAX CONFORMITY IS AS A SOURCE OF REVENUE TO OFFSET. SO I DO A A COPY TO DO SO WANT TO DEFER TO THE CHAIR AND AS I KNOW THAT'S NOT A CONFERENCE ITEM BUT HAPPY TO DESCRIBE BRIEFLY IF THAT WORKS GO AHEAD AND ANSWERS QUESTIONS YES A BASICALLY UNDER THE IT EVERY TIMETHAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSES -- SOME TYPE OF SWEEPING TAX REFORM OFTEN STATES INDIVIDUAL STATES TAKES ACTIONS TO CONFORM WITH THOSE MEASURES AND THOSE ARE DONE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. TO IMPROVE SIMPLICITY AND REDUCE THE BURDEN ON TAXPAYERS SO THAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING ONE CALCULATION FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES AND ANOTHER FOR STATE TAX PURPOSES. AND ALSO REDUCES THE NUMBER OF ERRORS WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO -- THOSE TWO TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF CALCULATIONS AND THOSE ERRORS CAN WE TO PENALTIES THEY WE TO A GREATER ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN BOTH ON THE STATE ON THE FTV. AS WELL AS THE TAXPAYER AND FINALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CHANGES ARE COULD PUBLIC POLICY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAN THE STATE CAN TAKE ACTION TO CONFORM WITH THOSE SO. WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET AND IN HIS NAY REVISION ACE WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE FEDERAL TAX REFORM? THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION DID NOT AGREE WITH THERE WERE SOME THAT FOR SOME THE AFFIRMATION REASONS AROUND SIMPLICITY AROUND GOOD PUBLIC POLICY MADE SENSE TO CONFORM WATCHED. SOME THOSE PROVISIONS RAISE REVENUE -- SOME OF THOSE COSTS REVENUE IN PARTICULAR ONE RELATED -- TO IMPROVING THE CLIMATE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND HOW THEY ACCOUNT -- BUT OVERALL THE PROVISIONS RAISE ENOUGH REVENUE. TO EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AT THE STATE LEVEL AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ASO HAS AN EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHICH IS MUCH MORE GENEROUS ON THE WHOLE AND SO WE VIEW THIS AS GOING IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL. AND WILL THAT TAX CONFORMITY COME THROUGH A TRAILER BILL. HAVE YET TO RECEIVE RESERVE TRAILER BILLS YES THOSE ARE POSTED. YES SO WE'LL GO THROUGH GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. WE WE SEE ADDRESSING THIS FOR THAT BUDGET PROCESS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU'RE WELCOME SKINNER. THANK YOU -- I THINK THERE'S BEEN NOTED THE THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THE ADVANCE PAYMENTS. AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME OF A LEGITIMATE ISSUES THAT OBVIOUSLY SHOULD STILL BE TALKED ABOUT ON THAT. BUT I WANTED TO SPEAK -- TO I SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND I ALSO WAS -- THE BOTH HOUSES HAVE BEEN HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT WE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FINDING THAT WE UTILIZE. TO DO OUTREACH AND ACTUALLY TO ASSIST PEOPLE. IN SUBMITTING PREPARING A TAX -- SUBMITTING TAX BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. A NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT. WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THAT ARE ELIGIBLE EVEN FOR THE FEDERAL. ART REQUIRED TO FILE THEIR TAXES SO. AND SO DOESN'T OCCUR TO THEM TO FILE. AND WERE YOU CALIFORNIA ALREADY INDEPENDENT OF OUR STATE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WE LEAVE A LOT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE FOR THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT BECAUSE WE HAVE. A LARGE NUMBER COMPARED TO A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES A LARGE NUMBER. OF RESIDENTS WHO DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT SO CLEARLY GIVEN THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM. IS TO ASSIST THOSE RESIDENTS AND TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON OTHER -- SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WE MAY BE PROVIDING THE MORE WE CAN DO TO ASSIST RESIDENTS APPLY FOR BOTH THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDITS THE FEDERAL AND THE CALIFORNIA'S THE BETTER. IN I KNOW THAT I THINK IT'S I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE RESEARCH RECENTLY BUT A FEW YEARS BACK NEW YORK STATE AND OREGON. HAD THE HIGHEST -- PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OF ANY OTHER STATE AND THEY THEY WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY IT WAS A STATE GOAL. TO ENSURE THAT. ALL RESIDENTS ELIGIBLE APPLIED AND I THINK IT'S A A WORTHWHILE THING FOR CALIFORNIA'S CONSIDER CLEARLY THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE. INCLUDED HERE THE UP TO TEN MILLION FOR OUR REGION SUCH WOULDN'T NECESSARILY ACHIEVE THAT IN UPSTATE IS POPULOUS IS OURS. BUT IT WOULD ASSIST US. THANK YOU MISTER MAY EIGHTH. I AM I USED TO PREPARE TAXES -- IN FACT THE FOR IT FOR YEARS AND AFFECT REMEMBER MY FIRST YEAR FOR PAYING TAXES WHEN THE THE ITC CAME UP. MEMBER A CLIENT THAT I I HAD -- THAT -- FIGURED OUT THE SYSTEM. AND REALIZED THAT THERE'S A SWEET SPOT I'M SHE WAS A HAIRDRESSER LEASE SO SHE SAID -- AND SHE WORKED FROM HER HOME AND SHE REALIZED THAT BECAUSE THE EITC WAS REFUNDABLE. I WHICH FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE WATCHING IT IS THAT YOU PAY NO TAXES AND YOU ACTUALLY GET THE CREDIT REGARDLESS SO TERE'S A PAYMENT -- THAT'S THERE AND WAS FASCINATING -- MEETING AND WHEN FILING THAT TAX RETURN AND SHE GOT IT UP -- PRETTY DECENT DECENT REFUND. I REMEMBER WHEN THIS CAME UP A FEW YEARS AGO WITH I WAS GONNA SUPPORT THE ATC BECAUSE I I DO SUPPORT AND EGGMAN TAX CREDIT BECAUSE THE IDEA WAS IN FACT INTERESTING LEE YEAH YOU KNOW MILTON FRIEDMAN WHO WE ALL KNOW AND EVEN RONALD REAGAN I BELIEVE IS. ONE A SIGNED IT INTO A TO LAW -- BACK IN THE IN THE EIGHTIES IN THE WHOLE CONCEPT BEHIND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WAS TO INCENTIVIZE WORK TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK YOU KNOW I CAN DO WELL IF -- IF I GO WORK THEN I'LL ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING A BENEFIT FROM THAT SO THAT MAYBE THERE ISN'T OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS -- THAT THEY RECEIVE RECEIVE ASSISTANCE ON AS THE ONE THING I STRUGGLED. WITH THE WIND -- THE IDEA OF THE I. T. A. N. CAME UP -- IN REVENUE TAX. ABOUT BECAUSE I THOUGHT TO MYSELF YOU THESE ARE -- INDIVIDUALS THAT LIVE HERE IN THE STATE IN THERE THE WORKING WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO WORK BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG. THAT THAT THESE FOLKS ARE ARE GOING TO BE HERE ON IN NOT IN THE STATE WE DON'T KNOW IF I CAN BE YOUR FOR A YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS IF THEY'RE GOING TO TRY. TO GET CITIZENSHIP TO BE ABLE TO A TO STAY HERE AND AND I GUESS I'M WONDERING -- WHY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T SUPPORT -- AT THE THE EXPANSION -- TO TO I. T. I END OF FILERS IS THAT THE REASON WHY -- WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE REASON WHY THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE HAVE PROPOSED IT BUT THE? BUT THE GOVERNOR BROWN HAS NOT HAS NOT PROPOSED EXPANDING AT THE ATC FILERS. ARE I T&lt;c.cyan&gt; TARIAN FILERS FOR&lt;/c&gt; THE ADMINISTRATION IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF COST PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND. NOTHING BEYOND THAT IS THERE ANY CONCERN AT ALL BY ANY EXPANSION OF THE IN OF OF FRAUD OR OR ABUSE AT ALL. YEAH -- SO IT WOULD IT WOULD BE A AN ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD BOTH BECAUSE BE ADDITIONAL RETURNS AND THERE'D BE SOME ADDITIONAL HURDLES TO GO THROUGH TO TO VERIFY THE THE AMOUNTS REPORTED -- BUT BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHY -- I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY -- I THINK IS THE ASSEMBLY THAT THAT ADDED A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS TO HAVE TO BE TO TO HANDLES RETURNS I DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE AS SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. IN. OR OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN TERMS OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS DO WE KNOW WHAT THE COST THE TOTAL COST WOULD BE -- FOR EXPANDING THAT THE THE THE A. T. C. T. I. TAN FOLLOW FILERS TO KNOW WHAT THE EXACT NUMBER IS. SURE SO -- WE DON'T -- WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT COST WOULD SPIN ESTIMATED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND SO FOR THE SENATE PROPOSAL I BELIEVE IT'S ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. AND FOR THE ASSEMBLY IT'S IT'S LESS THAN THAT BUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION AND IS THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS AT ALL DONE ON FOLKS IT WOULD BE RECEIVING THAT EA T. C.. THAT THERE WOULD BE -- SOME A CALL IT A RETURN ON INVESTMENT IF YOU WILL FOR FOLKS THAT ARE RECEIVING THAT AT THAT KNOWING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HERE AND OVER TIME BEING THAT PAYING TAXES TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER. AT THAT AMOUNT IS THEIR BEEN ANY ANALYSIS AT ALL THAT IN PAYING THAT -- THAT GIVING THEM THAT D. A. T. C. THAT THEY'LL BE WORKING HERE AND PAYING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TAXES -- AFTERWARDS OR IS IT JUST -- IT IS IT JUST I DON'T USE THE TERM HAND OUT BUT THE AGAIN THE GOAL OF THIS IS A TO INCENTIVIZE -- TO INCENTIVIZE WORK THAT'S WHAT THE ATC WAS WAS ALL ABOUT AND IT SEEMS LIKE WOULD BE EXPANDING A LITTLE FURTHER BEYOND BEYOND THAT. THE THE STRUCTURE THE ATC IS SUCH THAT AS YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED THE THE THE CREDIT GROWS UP TO A CERTAIN POINT IN THAT PHASE IT PHASES OUT SO THERE'S NOT A A CLIFF AFFECT. THE RIGHT NO BRIGHT BUT THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF THE GOAL IS TO TO GET THEM TO BE ABLE TO TO WORK MORE SO THAT THE MORE THAT THEY WORK THE MORE THAT THEY MAKE. A RIGHT THAT THAT ACTUALLY STARTS TO TAKE YOUR TO YOUR DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE OF OUR EXPANDING THIS THAT WOULD WANT. TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO BE WORKING HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME NOT JUST TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS TO MAYBE GO BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. BUT THAT THEY WOULD -- THEY WOULD BE HERE -- FOR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS TO BE ABLE ULTIMATELY -- YOU KNOW BUT PAID FOR IT IF YOU WILL HS THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS OF OF THAT. NOT MINE OKAY. TO TWO TWO QUESTIONS OUT ONE QUESTION TWO MINISTRATIONS THE REASON YOU DIDN'T INCLUDE AYE TENS. IN YOUR PROPOSAL. SINCE OUR TARGETS ARE CLEARLY FINANCIAL ISSUES. START THANK YOU -- THE SECOND QUESTION WAS IT WHAT WITH THE BENEFIT OF DOING. THE AYE TENS NOW VERSUS DOING IT LATER AFTER AFTER THE EXPANSION. IS IS IS THERE BENEFIT. IS THERE A BENEFIT FOR DOING THE AYE TENDS NOW AS OPPOSED TO DOING ITS NECK NEXT YEAR RIGHT AFTER AFTER THE EXPANSION UP AND SAY I THINK ISN'T IT OBSERVE COSTS SEEING YOUR PRIORITIES SO -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IF YOU DELAY IT YOU'LL HAVE MORE RESOURCES THIS YEAR FOR THE PRIORITIES CAST HAS NO THIS NO COST. BENEFIT EITHER WAY. I THERE'S NO COST I'M SORRY ON THERE'S NO COST BENEFIT TO DOING IT NOW VERSUS LOW THERE IS YES THERE IS A COST BENEFIT TRICK OFFICE. IT WOULD COST LESS I GUESS. THIS IS THE EXPAND THAT VIA FOR THE SENATE PROPOSAL TO THE DIFFERENCES I TURN SIXTY MILLION FOR THE EXPANSION BUT IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTAND ITEMS IS NOT NECESSARILY A CONFERENCE ITEM BOTH HOUSES EXPENDED TIGHTENED. THE TRUCK [inaudible] THANK YOU. IN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. I WOULD TO SIGNAL ALLAH DECIDE DID A MOMENT AGO WITH PAID FAMILY LEAVE THAT I THINK I WOULD CONSIDER IT YET ANOTHER PRO FAMILY. POLICY -- THAT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT A PRO FAMILY POLICY LOOKS LIKE THAT I THINK THIS. WOULD BE ONE AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING CONVERSATION CLOSING OUT THE ITEM. MOVING ON TO ISSUE TWENTY THREE UNDER THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. ADMINISTRATION OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH MANDATE AND EXPANDED SUBSIDIES. L. A. O.. SO THIS ISSUE IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE PROPOSED PREMIUM AFFORDABILITY ASSISTANCE AND MANDATE PENALTY ISSUE THAT WAS HEARD IN CONFERENCE CMMITTEE YESTERDAY. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO ADMINISTER THE PENALTY AND THE SUBSIDIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE POLICY. THE SENATE APPROVED THE PROPOSAL THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE PROPOSAL BUT WITH BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING THAT THE FUNDING BE CONTINGENT ON THE ENACTMENT OF A NEW LAW TO ENFORCE MANDATE PENALTIES INCREASE THE SUBSIDIES. SO THE ACTION YOU TAKE ON THIS ITEM SHOULD CONFORM TO HOW YOU TREAT. THE THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ITEM GENERALLY. THANK YOU FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION CONCURS WITH SENATE ACTION ON THE SIDE OF THE ROOM [inaudible] MR OBERNOLTE. A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO YOU'RE ASKING. FOR FIFTY POSITIONS. TO ADMINISTER THE PENALTY AND SUBSIDIES WHAT WHAT THOSE PEOPLE DO BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE -- YOU'RE COLLECTING THIS THE YOU KNOW THIS THAT SELF REPORTED ON THE BOND PEOPLE'S FIVE FORTIES RIGHT AND YOU'RE JUST COLLECTING THE MONEY THERE WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO HAVE FIFTY MORE PEOPLE. CHRIS STILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ACTUALLY FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO DO THEY HAVE -- TO THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY DETERMINE. WHO QUALIFIES TO RECEIVE SUBSIDIES SO THEY HAVE TO WORK FOR THE? DEPARTMENT OF COVERAGE ON A MANAGE HELP THE COVER CALIFORNIA EXCUSE ME TO ACTUALLY DETERMINE THE POOL OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SUBSIDIES. THAT HELP TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE SUBSIDIES ARE ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR THE SUBSIDIES THE DOING VALIDATION. CAUSING A LOT OF VALIDATION WORK TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR SUBSIDIES AND ALSO. TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY -- FOR IT ACTUALLY IDEA -- HADN'T UP INCOME ACTUALLY QUALIFIED TO HELP TO MEET THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE MANDATE. OKAY SO THIS IS ENGINEERING THE WAY THAT THE PENALTY IS PROCESSED RIGHT. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS YOU'LL HAVE TO DO THE FIRST YEAR BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE REQUESTING A HUNDRED POSITIONS ONGOING FOR THIS. IT WILL BE AN ONGOING WORK LOW BECAUSE THE WAY IT WORKS IS IF YOU DON'T HAVE IF YOU DON'T MEET A CERTAIN INCOME THRESHOLD ANY ON THAT YOU'RE NOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HELP THE HEALTH COVERAGE. SO THEY'RE GONNA BE CHECKING PEOPLE'S INCOMES AND VALIDATING THEY IN FACT DID OR DID NOT MEET THE THRESHOLD TO HELP HEALTH HEALTH INSURANCE. AND IF THEY MEET THE THRESHOLD HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND FRANCHISE HAS TO MAKE SURE THEY QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES TO HELP PAY FOR THAT INSURANCE SO IT'S A CONTINUAL ONGOING PROCESS SB DONE YEAR AFTER YEAR. OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE BY PEOPLE YOU CAN'T DESIGN SOME KIND OF AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO THE WATER THIS INFORMATION FOR AUTOMATION BUT THERE IS ALSO A HUMAN FACTOR INVOLVED IN ANYTHING. OKAY WELL I'M I'M I'M SKEPTICAL THAT THAT'S WHY. THE THAT WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS ENOUGH WORK FOR A HUNDRED PEOPLE. WE JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S THERE ARE THERE'S ALSO EXPECTED TO BE AN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CONTACTS BETWEEN TAXPAYERS AND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD REGARDING -- QUESTIONS THEY MAY HAVE IN THEIR PREPARES THEM MAY HAVE QUESTIONS THAT. TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS EXPECTING INCREASE IN COMMUNICATION -- IN CONTACT WITH TAXPAYERS AS WELL WHY BUY THAT BUT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THESE POSITIONS ARE NOT. THE END OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE THERE ANNOUNCED THEIR ELSEWHERE IN THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS THAT CORRECT. THEY ARE THEY ARE THROUGHOUT FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND AGAIN THEM THEY HAVE SHOWN US THE WORKLOAD DATA AND WE ARE CONVINCED AS WE CAN BE A VERY HEAVY -- HEAVY DUTY WORKLOAD FOR THEM THE WHOLE LET'S NOT DO IT ALL THAT [inaudible] BUDGET. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER MOORE Là. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THIS IS JUST DISAPPOINTED THAT. AFTER DISCUSSING STI IT'S EVERYBODY CHIPPING IN. LOOKING AT WHAT'S BEEN PAID OUT AND THEN. RE EVALUATE WHAT THE RATE SHOULD BE THE NEXT YEAR SORT OF MASSIVE CO OP ED. THAT'S ONE OF THE EXEMPTIONS FROM THE PENALTY AND AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IN ANOTHER AREA. OF OF TO NOT GET EXEMPTING THIS COOP APPROACH FROM A A MINISTRY SECOND NUMBER THAT. TITLE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE CONCEPT IS SIMILAR JUST BECAUSE IT IS AN REGULATED AYE. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE AS WE PURSUE THIS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER INDUSTRY THAT'S BEEN WORKING [inaudible] MANAGER. YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS. SEEING NONE GOING TO HOLD THE SADDAM ALTON. ISSUE TWENTY FOUR DEBT LIABILITIES A RESERVE UNDER HERS AND STIRRERS SYSTEMS. BUDGET RESERVES THE LAYOUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT YOU SHOULDHAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. THESE ARE TWO FAIRLY BIG PICTURE ISSUES AND ALSO BIG IN DOLLAR TERMS -- I I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT BUDGET RESERVES OVERALL AND THEN THE THREE PACKAGES WITH RESPECT TO DEBT AND LIABILITY PAYMENTS. SO STARTING WITH BUDGET RESERVES ON THE FIRST PAGE. THE TABLE OF THE TOP SHOWS THE TOTAL RESERVES THAT WOULD BE ENACTED UNDER EACH OF THE THREE PACKAGES. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TOTALS THE ASSEMBLY WITH AN AXE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF RESERVES AT TWENTY ONE BILLION WHILE THE GOVERNOR'S TOTAL RESERVE LEVEL BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE SILENCE -- WITHIN THIS TOTAL THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT NOTABLE RESERVE ACCOUNTS -- WHICH WOULD EACH RECEIVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS INTO THE DIFFERENT PACKAGES ALTHOUGH THE THREE PACKAGES THERE ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR FOR THE BSA THE STATE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RESERVE. THE ASSEMBLY WOULD ENACT A HIGHER LEVEL OF THE SFU THE STATE'S DISCRETIONARY RESERVE AND THE SENATE PUTS AN ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH IS FOR MEDI CAL AND CAL WORKS. JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE CONTEXT AROUND THESE NUMBERS OUR OFFICE IS ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT TWENTY TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVES WOULD BE NEEDED. FOR THE STATE TO COVER AT B. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A MILD TO MODERATE RECESSION ASSUMING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T WANT TO CUT PROGRAMS OR OTHER SPENDING RAISE REVENUES ARE SHIFT COSTS OTHER ENTITIES. NOTABLY THE ASSEMBLY ALSO CREATED A DISASTER ACCOUNT IT DOESN'T APPEAR IN THIS TABLE BECAUSE THERE'S NO BALANCE IN IT YET -- BUT WE WOULD ADD THAT THERE ARE TWO POTENTIAL MERITS ASSOCIATED WITH CREATING SUCH AN ACCOUNT. FIRST IT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO SORT OF SEPARATELY MENTALLY ACCOUNT FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECESSION VERSES A DISASTER. WHICH COULD BOTH BE SIZEABLE AND COULD OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY AND PERHAPS IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE STATE TO SAY FOR BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. THE SECOND IS THAT IT COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE MORE TRANSPARENCY FOR THE STATE IF IT'S A SINGLE ACCOUNT WHERE. A REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD BE DEPOSITED IN ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY COULD BE -- ALLOCATED FROM THAT POTENTIALLY ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE A LEVERAGE POINT -- TO USE FOR MORE OVERSIGHT OVER DISASTER COSTS. ALL TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE WHICH GIVES A AND BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE DEBT MY ABILITY PACKAGES ASSOCIATED WITH -- THE GOVERNOR SENATE AND ASSEMBLY I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE NUMBERS IN DETAIL JUST WANT TO GIVE SOME HIGH LEVEL -- COMMENTS ABOUT SOME TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FIGURES. SO THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY TWO TRADE OFFS THAT ARE OUTLINED BY THIS TABLE THE FIRST IS A QUESTION OF PAYING OFF STATE LIABILITIES VERSUS PAYING OFF LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER ENTITIES LIKE SAY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND UNIVERSITIES IN THIS CASE. AND THE SECOND HEARD OFFICE BETWEEN THE PAYING OFF RETIREMENT LIABILITIES WITH PAYING OFF BUDGETARY LIABILITIES. WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE VERSUS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TOWARDS THE STATE LIABILITIES TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S BUDGET BOTTOM LINE OVER TIME SO SAY IN A FEW BILLION DOLLARS OF STATE PAYMENTS TODAY WOULD REDUCE STATE COSTS BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER TIME GIVING THE STATE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. TO USE THOSE RESOURCES FOR OTHER PURPOSES. STRICT LIABILITY IS BY CONTRAST DON'T HAVE THIS POSITIVE EFFECT FOR THE STATE BUDGET CLEARLY BUT IT DOES HAVE THIS POSITIVE AFFECT FOR DISTRICT BUDGETS. AND SINCE THE STATE DOES HAVE A INCENTIVE TO IN TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S GOOD PHYSICAL HEALTH AMONG DISTRICTS AND THIS ALSO MAKES ON THE SECOND TURN OPPOSITION RETIREMENT LIABILITIES VERSES BUDGETARY LIABILITIES. IN GENERAL YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCES HERE BUT JUST TO BOIL IT DOWN TO ONE IMPORTANT ONE IS YOUR CONSIDERING THESE FINAL PACKAGES. RETIREMENT LIABILITIES TEND TO CARRY MUCH HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND SO BY PAYING OFF RETIREMENT LIABILITIES SOONER THE STATE CAN SAVE MORE MONEY OVER TIME. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE SENATE MOSTLY FOCUS. MOSTLY FOCUS ON STATE PAYMENTS AND HAVE A SIMILAR MIX BETWEEN RETIREMENT AND BUDGETARY LIABILITIES THE ASSEMBLY PLACES SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY TOWARD DISTRICT UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND I'M NOT TALK ABOUT. ODD STATE PAYMENTS FOR DISTRICT COSTS ON THE NEXT PAGE. SO THE THIRD PAGE TO SHOWS THE PAYMENTS EACH EACH OF THESE PLANS WOULD MAKE TOWARDS -- SEAT. SARS TOWARD SCHOOL DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES PENSION COSTS. IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S TWO TYPES OF PAYMENTS HERE AND TWO TYPES OF PENSION PLANS HERE US IS ALREADY BEEN GIVES COSTING CONFERENCE. THE TWO TYPES OF PAYMENTS ARE RATE RELIEF WHICH IS MORE AKIN TO PAYING SOMEONE'S MORTGAGE ON THEIR BEHALF FOR A COUPLE MONTHS SAY. AND UNFUNDED LIABILITIES WHICH IS MORE CAN TO PAYING DOWN THE MORTGAGE PRINCIPLE ON SOMEONE'S HOUSE. THEN THERE'S ALSO TWO TYPES OF PENSION SYSTEMS. ARE THE GOVERNOR FOCUSES PAYMENTS ON THE CAL STIRS SYSTEM WHICH IS THE STATE PENSION SYSTEM FOR CERTIFIED TO STATE CERTIFIED EMPLOYEES LIKE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS. BUT BOTH OF THE HOUSES ALSO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TOWARD THE CALPERS SYSTEM WHICH IS THE SYSTEM -- IN THIS CONTEXT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES THAT ARE NOT STATE CERTIFIED LIKE A CAFETERIA WORKERS ARE BUS DRIVERS. ONE FINAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS FOR PAYING DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH YOU THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CALPERS COST WHEREAS THE SENATE JUST ARGUMENTS THE RATE RELIEF ON BOTH SIDES. BE YOU THE QUESTION OF OF RATE RELIEF FORCES UNFUNDED LIABILITY IS REALLY A QUESTION OF SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM IN THE RIGHT RELIEF CASE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS CAN PROVIDE DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR SAVINGS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TODAY AN ADDITIONAL AND MORE SAVINGS ESSENTIALLY IN THE SHORT TERM. BUT UNFUNDED LIABILITY PAYMENTS PROVIDE THE LOWER AMOUNTS OF SAVINGS BUT OVER TIME IT ALSO pDOLLAR SAVINGS SO. SETTING ASIDE A COUPLE BILLION OF DOLLARS WOULD SAVE SAY TWO TO THREE DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVERTIME VERSES ONE DOLLAR -- FOR RATE RELIEF THANKS. FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ITS MY REVISION PROPOSAL INCLUDING LIABILITIES AND WE ARE HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THE DETAILS. AND THANK YOU MEMBERS MR OBERNOLTE. SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FIRST. HI GIVEN THAT THE LA -- SAYS THAT -- IF WE INVESTED DOLLAR RATE RELIEF WE'RE SAVING A DOLLAR THIS YEAR WE INVEST A DOLLAR IN PAYING DOWN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. THEN WE'RE SAVING TWO TO THREE DOLLARS LONG TERM. SO WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S JUSTIFICATION FOR INCLUDING THE EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU DID FOR THE STIRS. OUR RATE RELIEF AND THAT'S WHY NOT PUT THAT TOWARDS ONE UP AT ALL TOWARDS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. SO WHEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE STORES REALLY SPECIFICALLY -- THE OUR JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT IS TIED UP WITH THAT CAL STIRS FUNDING PLAN -- WHICH IS A VERY COMPLICATED PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- BUT LONG STORY SHORT THE RATES FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE SET BY STATUTE AND SO THE WAY THAT WE DECIDE TO STRUCTURE IT WHICH I BELIEVE IS SIMILAR IN SOME WAYS TO THE WAY THAT BOTH HOUSES. STRUCTURE THEIR OWN PROPOSALS IS TO SAY FOR THESE NEXT TWO YEARS WHICH ARE GOVERNED IN VERY SPECIFIC WAYS BY THAT PLANNED. OUT WE WILL GIVE WHAT WAS INITIALLY -- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS PER YEAR NOW IN THE NAY REVISION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. IN THE SECOND YEAR AND THEN TAKE THE BALANCE WHICH IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE OVERALL NOW TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND USE THAT TO BUY DOWN THE RATE OVER THE LONG TERM. AND SO YOU ARE CORRECT THAT WE'RE PROJECTING SAVINGS -- THAT ARE MORE IN THESE FIRST TWO YEARS COMPARED TO THAT BUY OUT BUT THAT BY OUT OF THE LONG TERM RATE SHOULD SAVE DISTRICTS SIGNIFICANT MONEY OVER THE COURSE OF THAT FORECAST PERIOD. SURE BUT WOULDN'T YOU SAVE MORE IF YOU PUT ALL THAT MONEY INSTEAD OF DID TO OUR RATE RELIEF PUT IT ALL TOWARDS PAYING DOWN A LONG TERM LIABILITIES. GENERALLY -- ON PRINCIPLE WOULD SAY YES BUT GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE CAL STARS FUNDING PLAN I WOULD WANT TO CHECK BACK ON THAT BEFORE BEFORE CONFIRMING. OKAY SO. THE YOU DID NOT PROPOSE OWEVER PUTTING ANY OF THE MONEY. ON PERS THE PER SIDE TOWARDS RATE RELIEF BUT THE ASSEMBLY DID SO WHAT WAS YOUR JUSTIFICATION AND DOING T FOR STARTERS AND NOT FOR PERS. SERVICES SPECIFICALLY FOR SCHOOLS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DID HAVE A SUPPLEMENTAL CALPERS PAYMENT GENERALLY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WHEN IT COMES TO THE SCHOOL PAYMENT -- THE ADMINISTRATION SENSE WAS THAT CAL STIRS HAS A LARGE -- UNFUNDED LIABILITY COMPARED TO THE CALPERS SCHOOLS POOL AND IN ADDITION -- HISTORICALLY FOR CAL STAR IS THE STATE AND THE SCHOOLS HAVE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT LIABILITY AND EACH STATE VERSUS SCHOOL SHARE HAS CHANGED OVER TIME MOST RECENTLY IN THE CAL STARS FUNDING PLAN. WERE AS FOR THAT CALPERS SCHOOLS POOL THE STATE TRADITIONALLY HAS NOT SHARED IN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT MY ABILITY BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY WAS TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF BOTH IN THE NEAR TERM. AND THE LONG TERM TO SCHOOLS AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CAL STARS PROPOSAL WAS ABLE TO DO THAT GIVING SCHOOLS A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THEY NEED TO MAKE. YOU KNOW I'M I'M REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF PAYING DOWN THE LONG TERM LIABILITIES I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE RATE RELIEF BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND I KNOW THE PRESSURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE UNDER. BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT HELPING THEM WITH RATES THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR. REALLY IS A IS NOT DOING THEM A DISSERVICE LONG TERM BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEIR ARMS AROUND. THE FACT THAT THE RATES ARE HIGHER -- I DON'T THINK THAT THAT FROM AN ACTUARIAL STAND FOR THAT THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE. ANYTIME SOON AND SO I WOULD ALMOST PREFER. THAT. THEY GIVE THAT REALIZATION SOONER MAKE IT WORK AND THEN WE CAN SAY TWO TO THREE DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE INVEST IF WE PUT ALL TOWARDS THE LONG TERM. BOB. PORTION BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT MY MAIL BUT IN GENERAL I'M I'M VERY SUPPORT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- SPEAKING OF A QUESTION FOR THE LA -- TALKING ABOUT THE STEP THE ARE. THE THE RELIEF PAYMENTS. COULD WE PUT STRINGS ATTACHED TO THOSE SINCE IT'S A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR REDUCTION IN SPENDING ON THE SCHOOLS IF WE WANTED TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE. WELCOME THIS IS GOING TO BE EXTRA MONEY BUT SHOULD WE DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEND ON SALARIES WE WANT TO SPEND IT ON I DON'T KNOW LONG TERM. INFRASTRUCTURE SOMETHING COULD WE DO THAT. I'LL HAVE TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO IS THE EXPERT ON SCHOOLS OKAY. KENNETH COUPON WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE UP LEGALLY YOU COULD CERTAINLY COULD DO THAT THE STATE IN THE PAST AND IT'S GIVEN DISTRICTS DISCRETIONARY MONEY HAS SOMETIMES -- ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS SUSPENDED IN SPECIFIC WAYS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY GRANTS. AND WE A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE ASK DISTRICTS TO ALLOCATE THEM -- FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND SOME OTHER SPECIFIC THINGS -- SO YES YOU COULD CERTAINLY ADD SOME -- pTHAT KIND OF RELIEF IF YOU WANTED. TO THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER. MR MCCARTY THANK YOU -- I KNOW WE DISCUSSED THIS ON OUR FIRST DAYWITH EDUCATION BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT. TRADE OFFS. AND SO IN THAT SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS SAID SENATOR ROTH AND I WENT THROUGH WITH THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WITH THAT. THANK MATT COMING IN TALKING ABOUT DISTRICTS ON THE BUBBLE. IN THE IT'S A REAL RIGHT NOW SO I I KNOW I KNOW IT PROBABLY IS MORE PRUDENT TO BUY THEM OUT ON A LONG TERM BUT THERE ARE DISTRICTS LITERALLY THAT WE COULD BE COMING. RUNNING AT A CAST INCLUDING OUR DISTRICT RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN LOS ANGELES AND UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND THAT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON US -- AS WELL IT'S THE ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS THE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS WHEN WE DID THESE -- THESE REFORMS. THAT IT HAD KEPT THAT THE DISTRICTS INCREASED PERSON STIRS CONJURED INCREASE CONTRIBUTION PLATEAUS IN BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO THIS KIND OF GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THEIR SO SWIMMING WE DON'T HAVE. HUGE. FINANCIAL MELTDOWN. AND IF HE STILL GROW LC A PFAFF AT A REASONABLE CLIP NEXT FEW YEARS THERE WILL BE SOME BREATHING ROOM IN A COUPLE YEARS IS THAT CORRECT. THERE IT RIGHT RIGHT NOW THE RATE PROJECTIONS FOR CALLOUSED OR IS ARE THAT THE RATES -- UNDER CURRENT LAW WOULD PEAK AT AROUND NINETEEN POINT 1% AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT THEY WERE SCHEDULED TO DROP ABOUT A PERCENTAGE POINT THE YEAR AFTER THAT. SO THERE'S A CERTAIN MOVING OUT PERIOD. RIGHT THAT IS FOR CAN AT THAT IS FAIRLY SENSITIVE TO HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING IF WE WERE TO HAVE A RECESSION OR COASTERS WERE TO EXPERIENCE SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT LOSSES IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE RATE. AND STATE OF DROPPING COULD ACTUALLY GO UP FROM NINETEEN POINT 1% OF SORT OF PRETTY SENSITIVE. TO OUT HOW THE FUND PERFORMS AND HOW THE ECONOMY DOES THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. SURE SO ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL WITH THIS MOVING IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND IF YOU DID THIS -- ACTION HERE. THAT WOULD HELP THE DISTRICTS THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WOULD. PRODUCE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FINANCE RELIEF. TODAY BUT ACTUALLY GET TO A BRIDGE TO WHERE THEY'LL HAVE MORE SUSTAINABILITY. YEAH LET ME THEY WERE THE PACKET THE NUMBERS IN THE PACKAGES ARE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RELIEF ME ONE POINT. TWO BILLION IN IN ONE HOUSE ONE POINT EIGHT TO ANOTHER I MEAN THAT IN A IN THE SHORT TERM IT'S IT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THREE MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER. THIS ONE IS AN ARE YOU I WANT TO AFFIRM THE GOVERNOR FOR SETTING ASIDE SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR CALPERS CAL STIRS. OUR FOR THE STATE FOR THE UNIVERSITIES TO FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ALSO A NUMBER FOR HIM FOR SETTING UP. A PROP NINETY EIGHT RAINY DAY FUND WHICH IS BEEN NONEXISTENT SO I I THINK HE SHOULD BE APPLAUDED. FOR BOTH. I'M OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT -- AND TROUBLE WE BRING DISCUSS THIS ON THURSDAY NIGHT BUT TODAY LAUSD IS VOTING. ON A PARCEL TAX SO WE'RE SEEING THE STRAINS AND STRESSES -- THE FIX MATT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM. HAS ALREADY BEEN IN PRETTY HEATED DISCUSSIONS WITH SACRAMENTO CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT SO THERE'S SOME SIGNS AND SIGNALS THAT WERE THAT THINGS COULD BE. COMING SO WITH THAT. I THINK THEY BOTH SHOULD BE FUNDED HIGHER. BUT I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR AND APPRECIATE. HIS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU PROPOSED AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AND AND AND HIT DANTE -- FOR FOR THIS PART OF THE BUDGET THANK YOU. ANY OTHER DOCTOR EVER. YOU KNOW I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR FOR THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE HERE AND BUT I I STILL HAVE. UGH SOME CONCERNS AS TO WHETHER ADWARE SERIOUSLY PREPARING FOR OF SOME. LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE WITH REGARDS TO THIS PARTICULAR FUND -- EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A PENSION PROBLEM. IN OUR SCHOOLS AND SO I'M WONDERING IF ANY OF YOU AS AN ORGANIZATION WHETHER IT'S A WITH THE SO DEPARTMENT FINANCER LA -- ANY OF YOU ARE YOU LOOKING AT A PLAN. THAT REALLY RESPONSE TO THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN THIS AREA. BECAUSE I GET THE SENSE THAT EVEN IF WE GIVE A CONTRIBUTION NOW. WHATEVER WHETHER WE GIVE IT -- TO RATES ARE WE GIVE IT TO PAYING DOWN THE DEBT. THAT WILL ONE WILL STILL BE IN DEBT. AND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL BE. TALKING ABOUT THIS AGAIN. OKAY SO HAVE ANY VIEW ACTUALLY SAT DOWN AND DECIDED WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM [inaudible] FOR EVER. I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I MEAN I HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE LONG THAT BEEN ON THE BUDGET THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A REQUEST FOR US TO HELP. WITH THE PENSION PLANS DATA. SO I'M AND I ALWAYS LIKE WE DO IN SOME GOOD WE JUST REALLY WAITING FOR THE PROBLEM. TO THAT IT WON'T SOLVE ITSELF BUT WE JUST SEEM TO PRETEND THAT WE ARE AND AND AS A RESULT WE HAVEN'T REALLY. WELL DONE A WHOLE LOT. IN TERMS OF REALLY SAYING YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S LIKE OKAY WE'VE GOT THIS PROBLEM THIS IS WHAT IT IS NOW WE NEED TO MOVE AT THIS DIRECTION WITH THIS KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF THIS KIND OF RESOURCES. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS EVERY DAY I WOULD HATE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF FINANCIAL PROBLEM MY HOUSEHOLD. AND NOT THINK AT SOME POINT THAT I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS DID. OR VOICE TO BASICALLY RESTRUCTURE WHAT I'M DOING OR WHATEVER I MEAN I YOU KNOW THIS IS A SEEMS TO BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION. AND OF THOSE OF US WHO REGULARLY SIX SEVEN YEARS OR MORE HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION OVER AND OVER. ARE ANY OF YOU WORKING ON SOMETHING. YEAH YOU MAY BE AND YOU MAY NOT WANT TELLS WHAT IT IS BUT I JUST I JUST WHAT IT IS IF ANYONE IS WORKING ON SOMETHING. THAT BEGINS TO REALLY ADDRESS THIS VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. I'LL SPEAK TO IT WITH A TWO POINT SEVEN FIRST. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND WE DIDN'T GET INTO THE SITUATION WITH THESE LARGE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES OVERNIGHT AND SO THERE'S NO WAY. TO GET OUT OF THEM QUICKLY BUT FIRST I THINK THE STATE HAS MADE SOME PROGRESS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE MENTION MCALISTER'S FUNDING PLAN WHICH PASSED FIVE YEARS AGO -- BOTH THE CAL STIRS AND CALPERS BOARDS HAVE REDUCED THE INVESTMENT RETURN RATE ASSUMPTION -- WHICH MAKES SURE THAT -- BOTH YOU KNOW EVERYONE IS PAYING MORE INTO THE SYSTEM SO THAT WE'RE NOT ON THE HOOK LATER WHEN IT COMES TO RETIREE HEALTH. BENEFITS WE'RE NOW BEGINNING TO PRE FUND THOSE AS A STATE AND SLOWLY PAYING OFF THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITY WITH THE GOAL AS WITH CAL STAR IS A FULLY PAYING OFF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. TWENTY FORTY SIX BUT YOUR BROADER POINT. THAT IS THE GOAL YES. BUT TO THE TO THE BROADER POINT IT IS IT THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE. BUT THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE ISSUES ARE VERY COMPLICATED BUT IN SOME WAYS THEY'RE ALSO VERY pIN NOW TO PAY OFF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. THE LAST THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT IN A WAITER AND OVER TIME AND THAT WILL RELIEVE PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND OVER THE LONG TERM AND THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNOR. THREE DAYS AFTER HE CAME INTO OFFICE AND WHEN HE PUT OUT THIS BUDGET REALLY WANTED TO PUT FORWARD THAT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAL STARS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. TWO POINT NINE BILLION I'M SORRY THREE GOING TO CALPERS TWO POINT NINE GOING TO CAL SIRS AFTER PROPOSITION TWO PAYMENTS BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT PLAN YOU ULTIMATELY A DOCTOR HOW YOU RESOLVE THIS OVER TIME. STARTING NOW AND PUTTING MONEY AND NOW WILL ALWAYS MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE OVER THE LONG TERM ASSUMING THE MARKET OVER TIME CONTINUES TO GROW OKAY. I SOME YOU'LL BE HEARING TWENTY FORTY SIX SO OKAY. I HAVE TO BELIEVE I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON I JUST DID THAT MENTAL MATH TO FIGURE OUT HOW OLD IT. FEELS LIKE A WELL MADE MY GRANDSON. OF I'M JUST YOU KNOW I I THINK AND AND THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT BUT I YOU KNOW -- SO ANYWAY JUST BECAUSE WE SEE THIS EVERY YEAR AND I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS A WHOLE THAT EVEN GROHL'S IT NEVER GETS FIELD OR WHATEVER THE DEAL MAY BE THAT NEW THINGS COME ALONG AND HEATED UP AGAIN AND SO WE'RE FOR EVER SEEM LIKE DIGGING DEEPER AND DEEPER AND I KNOW. WE WERE WORKING TO MAKE PROGRESS SO IT'S NOT ON ONE OTHER MAY NOT MAKE VERY BRIEFLY IS THAT SOME OF THESE CHANGES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE WHOLE THAT WERE AND IS A FUNCTION OF WHAT ASSUMPTIONS YOU MAKE ABOUT WHAT PAYMENTS YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IN THE FUTURE. SO WHEN CAL STIRS OUR CALPERS -- REVISES THEIR DISCOUNT OR INVESTMENT RETURN RATE OR THEY REALIZED THAT PEOPLE ARE MAY BE LIVING LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT. THE WHOLE GETS BIGGER BUT IT'S NOT THAT WE'VE LOST MONEY IT'S JUST A MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO YOU'RE PUTTING WHATEVER THE SIZE OF THAT WHOLE IS IN REALITY PUTTING MONEY IN RIGHT NOW WILL MAKE IT SMALL. OKAY. HELLO YOU HAVING ANY WISDOM ON THIS MATTER. I THINK WE MIGHT JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THE CHARACTERS FUNDING PLAN WAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE FOR THE STATE THE SYSTEM HASN'T. BEEN APPROPRIATELY FUNDED FOR MOST OF ITS A HUNDRED PLUS YEAR HISTORY. AND TWENTY FOURTEEN THE STATE WITH THAT PLAN WENT FROM -- TRAJECTORY WHERE THE SYSTEM IS. ON TRACK TO RUN OUT OF MONEY IN ABOUT THIRTY YEARS TO A TRAJECTORY WERE IT'S SCHEDULED TO REACH FULL FUNDING IN ABOUT THIRTY YEAR IS AN OBVIOUSLY OVER THE FIRST FIVE YEARS IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO SEE THAT PROGRESS RIGHT AWAY BUT OVER THE COURSE OF DECADES IF THE STATE. A STICKS WITH THAT PLAN IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ON TRACK SO FAR AND WILL EVENTUALLY REACH THAT THRESHOLD. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IN OUR SOME OF AYE COMMENTS TO THE SUBCOMMITTEES. WE'VE PLACED SUCH A HIGH EMPHASIS ON STICKING WITH THE COASTERS PLAN BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT'S VIABLE IT WILL ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OVER TIME. IT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR DISTRICTS BUT IT'S KIND OF WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO REALLY GET THE SYSTEMS ON TRACK OKAY WELL THANK YOU. TWENTY FORTY SIX OH COME LOOKING FOR YOU GUYS. I'LL BE EIGHTY TWO ALL RIGHT SHOT DOWN WITH THE DOCTOR WEBER. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. ON THE ISSUE. WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OKAY. WE CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE. TWENTY FIVE MUSEUM FUNDING UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. HELLO THANK YOU FOR CALLING CHRISTINE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS AS MENTIONED THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU AS YOU TWENTY FIVE MUSEUM FINDING. THE OVERNOR PROPOSED TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND TO THE ARTS COUNCIL TO SUPPORT TO MUSEUMS SPECIFICALLY FIRST THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR THE ARMENIAN AMERICAN MUSEUM AND CULTURAL CENTER.

SECOND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR THE LOS ANGELES MUSEUM OF THE HOLOCAUST THE SENATE APPROVED THIS PROPOSAL AS PROPOSED TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROVE THE FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSAL. BUT SHIFTED THE ADMINISTERING AGENCY FROM THE ARTS COUNCIL TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY OR ANOTHER STATE ENTITY. THE CONFERENCE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS WHICH STATE AN ENTITY SHOULD ADMINISTER THESE FUNDS. WE THINK THE ADMINISTERING AGENCY IS REALLY AN ISSUE FOR LEGISLATIVE PREFERENCE -- YOU COULD GO EITHER DIRECTION THE ARTS COUNCIL HAS EXPERIENCE ADMINISTERING YOU KNOW GRANTS TO NONPROFITS INCLUDING ARTS AND AND CULTURAL RELATED. ENTITIES ON RESOURCES AGENCY ALSO HAS EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA THEY'VE -- PROVIDED FUNDING TO MUSEUMS IN THE PAST INCLUDING THE ARMENIAN AND ARMENIAN AMERICAN MUSEUM SO EITHER EITHER APPROACH IS REASONABLE. THANK YOU FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE SENATE ACTION ON OUR ON THIS PROPOSAL AND BELIEVE THAT THIS FUNDING IS ALIGNED WITH THE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. QUESTION FOR MEMBERS CENTER NIELSEN. THE ARTS COUNCIL I WOULD ARGUE IS. BETTER SERVE. FOR THIS PARTICULAR. PURPOSE -- RELATED TO EVEN THE MUSEUM. THE COUNCIL. FOR EXAMPLE A FEW YEARS AGO. WHAT INTO THE ARCHIVES THE STATE IN WEST SACRAMENTO? AND GOT A NUMBER OF INDIAN BASKETS. AND FORMULATED A TRAVELING EXHIBIT OF INDIAN BASKET. AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE THEY WORKED WITH THE INDIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION. TO DO THIS IN FURTHER. FOR MANY YEARS. THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCILS BUDGET WAS ONE MILLION DOLLARS NOW. MARCH SUPPOSED TO BE A BIG PART OF THE HISTORY OF THIS STATE. IT'S CULTURE. THE TO CON. BUT THE BUDGET WAS ONLY ONE MILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] AND WE DID GET IT UP AND I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LAST YEAR BUT I THINK WAS AROUND FIFTEEN MILLION. BUT WE GOT INTO A BIDDING WAR. HERE ONE NIGHT. CENTER LENT A ONE NINE AND I MADE AN OFFER OF SEVEN AND HE MADE AN OFFER A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND I SAID. SEVEN CENTER DILLON LAUGHED AND SAID YOU KNOW THE CHILI TIME THAT JIM NIELSEN IS EVER OUTBID ME.

I JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE BRIEFLY HOW IMPORTANT THIS FUNDING IS THE A LITTLE EARLIER THIS YEAR A NUMBER OF OF THE MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE TOOK. A TRIP TO PARADISE TO TOUR THE COMMUNITY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. TO TALK TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THEIR RECOVERY EFFORTS AND IT IS REALLY SOBERING TO THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THOSE GOVERNMENTS ARE FACING. BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION IS NOW DISPLACED AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN THEY DO TO YOU KNOW THERE IF IF YOU'RE A WATER AGENCY AND YOU'VE GOT. A THIRD OF THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE CONNECTIONS AS YOU DID BEFORE THE FIRE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS AND YEARS TO RECTIFY SO -- IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE APPROVE THIS FUNDING AND I I'M VERY GRATIFIED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SEES IT THAT WAY TOO BECAUSE THIS IS RE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY NEEDED. MR MAYES FOLLOWED BY SEVENTY NIELSEN. YEAH I JUST WANTED TO ECHO -- THOSE THOSE COMMENTS IN JUST SUGGESTING AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO ABOUT THESE FIRES IN THE FUTURE WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE THESE COMMUNITIES WERE ACTUALLY DEVASTATED. AND WHAT WHEN THEY ARE DEVASTATED AT FAT CATASTROPHIC TRULY THAT CATASTROPHIC LEVEL THERE IS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO COME IN TO TRY TO GET THEM BACK ON THEIR FEET AGAIN THIS IS WHAT THAT'S WHY -- MY SUPPORT THIS AND THE PROPOSAL [inaudible] THIRTY NIELSEN. WELL FOLKS I'VE LET THIS ONE FOR MANY MONTHS. BEING UP THERE PERSONALLY LONG WITH ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER ALMOST EVERY WEEK. AND INDEED. IT'S AN APT DESCRIPTION THE DEVASTATION WAS TOTAL. THE NOT JUST TO THE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO RESIDED IN PARADISE THERE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT LIVE UP ON THAT RICH IT'S A VERY LARGE RIDGE. BORDERED ON EITHER SIDE BY CANYONS WHICH IS A PART OF WHY THE FIRE. BEING SUCH A VELOCITY. BUT IT ALSO HAS AFFECTED OTHER CITIES IN THAT COUNTY. AND THAT'S PART OF WHY THIS ASSEMBLY ACTION IS HELPFUL. CHICO. IN ORDER PARTICULARLY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED. BY THE POPULATION THAT HAS. COME TO THEM THE HOMELESS POPULATION IT HAS INCREASED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAS HAD TO BEFORE ALTHOUGH CITIES BECAUSE OF THE DISASTER THAT HAPPENED RIGHT THERE TO THEIR NEIGHBORS. IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY THE CONCENTRATION OF THE POPULATION IN PARADISE IT'S GOING TO TAKE. DECADES. TO COME BACK. AND THEY'VE LOST ALL OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE [inaudible] THAT'S ASSEMBLYMAN MENTIONED THE INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED. TO THE FIRE WHICH IS. WHAT'S HAPPENED UP THERE IS THE WATER DISTRICTS. HAVE NO WATER CELL. THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMERS. SO WE'RE HAVING TO AND WE'RE WORKING IN THIS VERY BUDGET. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT. THE IMPACT ON OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT. IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S PARADISE IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T OTHER AIR AREAS THAT ARE AFFECTED. AND OVER THE DECADES THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY KIND AND GENEROUS TO COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN ACT INFECTED BY VARIOUS AND SUNDRY. DISASTER NATURAL DISASTERS FORCES MAJEURE. AS IT'S CALLED AND AND I THINK IT IS PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. AND ONE PERSONAL SIDE TO THIS. I GET PRETTY DISGUSTED ABOUT. HUMANKIND ON OCCASION. BUT SOMETHING WAS VERY HEARTENING DURING THE MEETING THAT MATCH THE FIRE IS RAGING THROUGH THE CITY. THEN I'M UP THIRTY EVACUATION CENTERS. SO MANY INDIVIDUALS FROM ALL OVER AMERICA CAME UP TO ME THEY WERE RESPONDER. FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

WHO EXPERIENCED THESE EXTRAORDINARY [inaudible] EXPENSIVE TRIALS. AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO DO THAT. OVER THE YEARS. THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE BEHAVIOR AND BECAUSE OF THE THE LONG LONG. TIME THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS AMONGST US. NOT PAYING THE JUDGE JUST DESSERTS. BUT IT IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW WE DO NEED TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT. AND MANY COMMUNITIES WERE AFFECTED BY THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.

THANK YOU SIR A AGAIN NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE WHOLE THAT ITEM OPEN. COLLEAGUES WE JUST COMPLETED -- STATE ADMINISTRATION GENERAL GOVERNMENT I AM GOING TO SUGGEST.

OFF HOME BEFORE WE THEN LAUNCH INTO THE FINAL SECTION -- OF THE GENDER WITH THIS PUBLIC SAFETY LABOR. OFF IT'S FOUR THIRTY FIVE AT FOUR FIFTY WE WILL RETURN. WE STAND IN RECESS I THINK I HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE. ON BOTH SIDES [inaudible] THREE YEP. THREE THIS IS WILD RECESS IS SO IMPORTANT IN SCHOOL EVERYBODY NEEDS RECESS. YES RIGHT WE NEED A LITTLE RIGHT. NO WE DIDN'T GET TO HAVE NUTRITION SNACKS BUT YOU KNOW HI BUT RECESSES ALWAYS IMPORTANT. RING THE BELL. YOU CAN GET ME AT A SANDBOX THAT'S WHERE I WAS. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN -- IF YOU WOULD PLEASE ALLOW ME TO TAKE AN ITEM UP FIRST OUT OF ORDER. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ISSUE. TWENTY PROP SIXTY FOUR TAX REVENUE. I HOPE THAT DOESN'T CAUSE A PROBLEM FOR LA OR FINANCE. NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. INCREASING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SAID THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS KIND OF X. CANNABIS TAX REVENUE -- FROM PROP SIXTY FOUR JUST AS A LITTLE BRIEF BACKGROUND PROP SIXTY FOUR ESTABLISHED AT THE CAMPUS TAX FUNDS WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY SOME NEW TAXES ON CULTIVATION IN RETAIL SALES ON CANNABIS. THE FINDING -- BUT IN THAT FINDS IS DISTRIBUTED INTO THREE BUCKETS THE FIRST BEING FOR REGULATORY IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- BEEN THERE SINCE SPECIFIED ALLOCATIONS AND THEN THIRD THERE SOME PERCENTAGE ALLOCATIONS. THE PERCENTAGE ALLOCATIONS GO TO THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OR SUB ACCOUNTS 60% GOES TO A YOUTH CCOUNT 20% TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNT. AND ABOUT 20% TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNT. SO IN NINETEEN TWENTY THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING HAVING FUNDING THAT WILL GO TO THESE PERCENTAGE ALLOCATIONS. ARE THE GOVERNOR PRESENTED A PLAN TO ALLOCATE TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS OF THOSE REVENUES I'M CONSISTENT WITH -- THE PROPOSITION. SO SPECIFICALLY 60% -- CONSIST WITH THE MEASURE WOULD GO TO THE ACCOUNT THAT'S ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS I IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY IN THIS WOULD BE PROVIDED -- FOR CHILDCARE SLOTS AND SOME OTHER PURPOSES THIS WAS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY IN THE EDUCATION -- GUYS DISCUSSIONS ON I CAN GO OVER THAT IN ANY DETAIL TWENTY FOR ABOUT 20% WOULD GO TO ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES AT CONSISTENT WITH MEASURE. OF FOURTEEN THAT'S ABOUT FORTY MILLION I WOULD GO TO CLEAN UP FOR MEDIATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CREATED BY YOU LEGAL ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION. AND ABOUT 20% AGAIN GOING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNT THAT'S ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AGAIN FOR PUBLIC SAFETY RELATED ACTIVITIES. THAT'S THINGS LIKE GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS SPENDING ON DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE ACTIVITIES. TO THE SENATE DID NOT TAKEN ACTION IT RELATED TO THE ALLOCATION OF THESE REVENUES THE ASSEMBLY REALLOCATED THE REVENUES AND A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS. AS WAS DISCUSSED IN THAT IN EDUCATION PORTION OF THE DISCUSSION OTHERS REALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING FOR THE CHILD CARE SPOTS TO YOU AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION SAFETY PROGRAM -- BUT ALSO ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S USE OF TEN POINT ONE MILLION. OF FOR PREVENTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND INSTEAD PROVIDED TEN POINT ONE MILLION FOR WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST MARIJUANA PLANTING PROGRAM -- AND THEN ON THE LINE FOR SPENT SIDE THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED USE OF TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND INSTEAD ALLOCATED FIFTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION FOR LOCAL ONE FORCE FORCE MAKE GRANTS TEN MILLION FOR STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT. OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INTERAGENCY TEAM THE CONVERSATION BEFORE YOU IS THE USE OF THE PROP SIXTY FOUR REVENUES AS OUTLINED IN THE ASSEMBLY IS ACTION. OUR COMMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE NOTED -- IN THE EDUCATION PORTION OF OF YOUR DISCUSSION I WE DO THINK THERE SOME LEGAL UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO LEGISLATE THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO REALLOCATE THESE REVENUES -- HOWEVER WE DEFINITELY THINK THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSULT WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THESE ON THESE FUNDS AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S A STRONG OVERSIGHT ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE CLEARLY. AS WE THINK IT'S CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUIRE REPORTING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUTCOME MEASURES. HE VERY MUCH OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE SENATE. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY SEE NONE WILL LEAVE THAT ITEM OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INDULGENCE WE WILL NOW RETURN TO ISSUE. ONE UNDER VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. TO FOCUS ON THE PRISON TO COMMUNITY PIPELINE PACKAGE. PUT FORWARD BY THE SENATE. LA -- WHEN YOU'RE READY? THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAITLYN O'NEILL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE SENATE PACKAGE WOULD PROVIDE A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION IN NEW GENERAL FUND MONEY AND FIFTEEN MILLION RE APPROPRIATED FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. FOR A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IN ADDITION TO EIGHT MILLION IN EACH OF THE SUBSEQUENT TWO FISCAL YEARS. THESE FUNDS WOULD SUPPORT A VARIETY OF RE ENTRY SERVICES AS WELL AS REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS FOR INMATES AND PAROLEES. THE HAND OUT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU HAS SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS. ON THE PACKAGE. M. THE GOVERNOR AND ASSEMBLY HAD NO PROPOSAL. AND WE THINK THAT THIS ISSUE IS A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY SO I DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION A SHARE WITH YOU TODAY -- BUT DO YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS FROM OUR OFFICE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST IS THAT THE FUNDING IS LIMITED TERM -- HOWEVER SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT LIMITED TERM IN NATURE. IN ADDITION AT SOME OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES OUR PILOT PROGRAM SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO REQUIRE AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THOSE ACTIVITIES. AND FINALLY IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE PROPOSED TWELVE MILLION FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT FOR PRO LEASE WOULD INTERACT INTERACT WITH -- CITY THIRDS INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE TAKING UP LATER IN THE AGENDA TODAY. THANK YOU FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT THREE NINE WILL MOVE A HOLD ITEM OPEN. AND PROCEED ISSUE TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE PACKAGE. HELLO. ANITA LEE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THIS IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S A HAND OUT I BELIEVE HAVING YOUR BINDERS IF. HAVE A COPY OF IT -- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT THERE IS A TABLE BEFORE YOU SHOWING THAT THE SENATE PLAN PROVIDES AN ON GOING ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POINT FIVE MILLION. GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES IF YOU LOOK AT THE TAPE -- THE TABLE BEFORE YOU -- THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ITEMS ARE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE RESTORATION OF AN ANNUAL SOLID US MEN FOR TRIAL COURT OPERATION FINDING FOLLOWED BY COURT REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW. AND CIVIL LAW CASES AT FIFTY MILLION AND COURT INVESTIGATORS AND CONSERVATORSHIP AND GUARDIANSHIP CASES AT TEN MILLION. THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS CANNOT PROVIDE SOME KEY BACKGROUND THAT WE WON'T GET INTO BUT IS THERE FOR YOUR REFERENCE -- THIS IS YET ANOTHER ONE WHICH IS A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY COUPLE OF COMMENTS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE RESTORATION OF THE ANNUAL -- SAL ADJUSTMENT [inaudible] SPECIFICALLY. OUR OFFICE HAS HAD CONCERNS THAT WITH AUTOMATIC INCREASES AS IT REALLY DOES LIMIT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THE SECOND COMMENT AS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN AUTOMATIC INCREASES SAL DOES FLUCTUATE PRETTY SUBSTANTIALLY AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER THAT AS PART OF ITS DELIBERATIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL AND WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE A LARGE INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THANK YOU FOR THAT. COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS SENATOR SKINNER [inaudible] I'M. MENTOR IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME ALL MAKE COMMON ON THIS AND I'LL MAKE A COMMENT ON THE PREVIOUS ITEM SINCE BOTH WERE SAID IT ACTION ABSOLUTELY. SO IN THE IN THIS -- ACCESS TO JUSTICE. A GOOD DEAL OF IT ARE CONTINUATIONS OF ACTIVITIES THAT WE APPROVED LAST YEAR. THESE ARE ONE TIME MOST OF THEM -- I AND OF COURSE -- TO HELP LESSEN GENERAL FUND TO PRESSURE EVEN THOUGH WE'VE FIELD FOR EXAMPLE THE OUR COURT REPORTER. ISSUES AND THE AT SOME OF THE OTHER THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS AND ALL HAVE BEEN HAVE HAVE. D.. M. GIVEN US THE RESULTS THAT WE WERE HOPING. AND IF WE HAVE A I NINE IMAGINE THAT THE POLICE SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF MY SUBCOMMITTEE WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO PROVE THESE ON GOING. BUT WE WERE ALSO CONSCIOUS OF GENERAL FUND PRESSURE SO WE DID THEM PRIMARILY AS ONE TIME. THOUGH THESE ARE ACTIVITIES THAT THE STATE HAS GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH AND HAVE BEEN -- PRODUCTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL IN A FIGHT GO BACK TO AND THAT IS IN THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE PACKAGE WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS IF YOUR NEW. BUT IF I GO BACK TO THE PRISON TO COMMUNITY PIPELINE PACKAGE -- I THINK WHAT WE HAVE A I DON'T EVEN THINK WE ALL KNOW. THAT -- EVEN BEFORE THE VARIOUS REFORMS THAT BOTH THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE LEGISLATURE OF PUT INTO PLACE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT SERVE IN OUR STATE PRISONS RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AT SOME POINT. WE NOW HAVE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER NUMBERS RETURNING BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE REFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED AGAIN SOME BY THE LEGISLATURE SOME BY THE VOTERS. AND WITH PUBLIC SAFETY IN MIND WHAT WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON IS TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WHEN FOLKS RETURNED BACK HOME. THAT THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL WITH THEIR RE ENTRY AND PUBLIC SAFETY IS -- PRESERVED SO WE HAVE. OVER THE YEARS. SINCE THE RECESSION BEEN BEEFING UP THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR STATE PRISONS AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF OF THE ITEMS IN THIS PRISON COMMITTEE PIPELINE PACKAGE THAT DEAL WITH THAT. THEN WE'VE ADDITIONALLY BEN. I TRAIN SURE UP THAT SUPPORT THAT WE PROVIDE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE TALKED YOU'LL SEE IN THIS LISTED INCLUDE SOME OF THE HIGHER ED SUPPORT BOTH IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE STATE ARE CSU SYSTEM IN YOU SEE BUT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT. WHEN WE DON'T WHEN WE TALKED IN EDUCATION SO I WON'T GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN -- BUT ONE OF THE ITEMS IS THE REENTRY GRANT PROGRAM WHICHIS BEEN ADMINISTERED BY THE SEC. AND IT WAS FIRST STARTED BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT DUE TO LACK OF CLARIFICATION THE TBL. ONE VERY LITTLE OF THE MONEY THAT THE FCC MADE AVAILABLE WAS ACTUALLY DELIVERED TO THE COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY WE MADE SURE. TO THAT THE OR IF P. THAT WAS PUT OUT WAS DESIGNED SO THAT THE COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS WOULD BE ABLE. TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES AND PROVIDE THE TYPE OF EITHER HOUSING OR REENTRY SUPPORT THAT WAS THE FINDING WAS ELIGIBLE FOR AND IN THIS LAST ROUND. AND I BELIEVE -- DSCC HAD ABOUT -- ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION AVAILABLE TO BE -- TO DISTRIBUTING GRANTS [inaudible] THERE [inaudible] THE APPLICATIONS THEY RECEIVED. WORK QUADRUPLED WHAT WAS THE MONEY THAT WAS AVAILABLE. AND SO SOMETIMES WHEN WE CREATE THESE ONE TIME ONLY THINGS WE SEE EITHER A AT A THAT THE FUNDS MAY BE. UNDER UTILIZED STOREBUT IN THIS CASE WE HAVE SAW THAT THERE IS -- NOT ONLY GREAT DEMAND BUT GREAT NEED SO WE WANTED TO CONTINUE IT AND AGAIN. I'M JUST BEING CONSCIOUS OF GENERAL FUND PRESSURES WE DIDN'T PUT IT IN AS ON GOING WE DID IT AS ONE TIME EVEN THOUGH IN EFFECT THEY ARE CONTINUATIONS -- AND THE ISSUE AROUND THE THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES WE IN THE STATE YOU KNOW WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHEN WE GET TO THAT SECTION. SO THOSE ARE THE COMMENTS ARE ONE TODAY EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIRTY NIELSEN NOT A FAIR. COULD WE BREAK THESE OUT FOR INDIVIDUAL VOTES ARE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO VOTE. JUST ON THE WHOLE PACKAGE THIRTY NIELSEN -- WHEN WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE'VE GOT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO ACTUALLY TAKE DEALT KNOWS ALL MAKE A NOTE AND? WE'LL BE HAPPY TO BREAK THAT OUT THERE THANK YOU ON IT IS THAT YOUR REQUEST ON ISSUE ONE AND TWO WE WILL MAKE THAT HAPPEN WHEN THE TIME COMES. NOT A PROBLEM ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE WILL BE HOLDING THAT ITEM OPENED MOVING ON TO ISSUE THREE PRE TRIAL SERVICES PILOT. UNDER THE JUDICIAL BRANCH BELIAU. THE GOVERNOR'S REVISED -- PLAN PROVIDES A ONE TIME SEVENTY FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ADMINISTRATE A TWO YEAR GRANT PROGRAM -- RELATED TO PRE TRIAL DECISION MAKING PROGRAMS OR EFFORTS IN AT LEAST TEN COURTS -- THE PILOT ALSO WILL HAVE VARIOUS DEFINED GOALS SUCH AS EXPANDING THE USE OF AND VALIDATION OF PRE TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS. THAT MAKE THEIR METHODOLOGY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION -- IT ALSO DETAILS HOW FUNDS MAY BE USED -- SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FOR EXCHANGES OF DATA BETWEEN COURTS AND COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. FINALLY THE REVISED LANGUAGE ALSO INCLUDES REPORTING ON CERTAIN KEY METRICS ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE SENATE APPROVED THIS PROPOSAL AND ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE FUNDING AND ADOPTED BOTH PLACEHOLDER BUDGET BILL AND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THE ASSEMBLY PACKAGES DIFFERENT IN TWO KEY WAYS. THE FIRST IS IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SPECIFIED GOALS OF THE PILOT THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN IS TO LIMIT THE PILOT TO THE USE AND VALIDATION OF THOSE TOOLS. THAT MAKE THEIR METHODOLOGY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ONCE AGAIN THAT'S LIMIT RATHER THAN EXPAND THE IS. THE SECOND DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF ACCEPTABLE USES OF THE FUNDING THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN ALLOWS -- FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BE. BETWEEN COURTS AND PRE TRIAL SERVICES AGENCIES RATHER THAN JUST COUNTY PROBATION AND SO THAT WOULD ALLOW OTHER COUNTY AGENCIES TO BE -- FUNDED USING THOSE DOLLARS. AND SO THIS REALLY IS AN ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY FOR HOW THE LEGISLATURE WANTS THIS PILOT TO BE IMPLEMENTED. AS WELL AS WHO SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE. WE WOULD NOT THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A TECHNICAL DIFFERENCES WHILE THE SENATE AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN IS MAINLY AND BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE VERSES THE ASSEMBLY WHICH IS MAINLY AND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THIS IS A TWO YEAR PILOT SO IT COULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING THE LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE SENATE ACTION ON THE SIDE. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. ISSUE FOR TRIAL COURT JUDGESHIPS UNDER THE JUDICIAL BRANCH LA -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES THIRTY POINT FOUR MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO SUPPORT TWENTY FIVE NEW JUDGESHIPS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED STAFF COMPLIMENTS. THE JUDGESHPS WOULD BE ALLOCATED BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL UPON COMPLETION OF AN UPDATE OF THE JUDICIAL NEEDS ASAP. AND PURSUANT TO THAT ASSESSMENT WHICH IS BASED ON WORKLOAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WAS ALSO ADOPTED SPECIFYING THAT THE NEW JUDGESHIPS OFFSETS A PORTION OF THE FORTY EIGHT REMAINING AUTHORIZED BUT UNFUNDED JUDGESHIPS. BOTH HOUSES APPROVED THE PROPOSAL BUT THE SENATE ALSO ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SPECIFYING A POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT ALLOCATION OF THE METHODOLOGY BY WHICH JUDGESHIPS WOULD BE ALLOCATED -- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. THE JUDGESHIPS HAVE TRADITIONALLY OR HISTORICALLY BEEN ALLOCATED USING THE JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THANK YOU ANY -- QUESTIONS FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO HOLD TO ITS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL AND DOES BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS THE PROPER FORUM TO ALLOCATE THESE JUDGESHIPS BASED ON NEED. THANK YOU FOR THE ROTH THE MANAGER IN -- IN I COMMEND YOU FOR DOING THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MUCH NEEDED ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST AN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN. MANY OTHER PLACES. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN AS WE CRAFT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHEN I WOULD ASK. IS THAT WE ENSURE THAT THE STAFF COMPONENT. STAYS WITH THE JUDGE POSITION. AND THAT THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY TO SPLIT. THE STAFF FUNDING OFF FROM THE JUDICIAL POSITION. BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE FOR CREATING NEW JUDGESHIPS IF WE CAN'T OPEN NEW COURT ROOMS. AND I HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT THERE IS SOME -- CONVERSATION NOT IN THIS BUILDING NOT ON THE FIRST FLOOR BUT OUTSIDE. TO DO JUST THAT AND THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE TO ME AND I'M SURE IT WOULD BE TO MY COLLEAGUES TO THE RIGHT [inaudible] THANK YOU. M. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT. TO AMENDED THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOME. FOR PAYING SOME ATTENTION TO THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKING -- FOR BAKING FOR WOULDN'T BE OVERSTATING IT FOUR OF THE FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SOMETHING I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. GOVERNOR BROWN. ALWAYS THE THE FISCAL CONSERVATIVE -- WAS OF THE OPINION THAT WE WERE OVER RESOURCE IN JUDGES IN SOME COUNTIES IN UNDER RESOURCE AND OTHERS AND HE ALWAYS WOULD TELL US THAT WE NEEDED TO TAKE JUDGES AWAY FROM. THE COURTS THEY WERE OVER RESOURCE BUT IF YOU ASK THE COURTS NONE OF THEM THINK THAT THEIR OVER RESOURCE AND SO THAT WAS JUST A POLITICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND SO THAT WE WHICH IS PERPETUATED THIS PROBLEM OF JUDGE SHORTAGES. I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THIS IS IT'S A GOOD START -- BUT ACCORDING TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE NEED ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY JUDGES RIGHT NOW STATEWIDE TO HANDLE THE WORKLOAD SO TWENTY FIVE IS. THE IS GREAT I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WHITTLE DOWN ON THAT IN THE FUTURE. AND I ALSO HAVE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT. IT IS EXTREMELY UNBALANCED. THE THE JUDICIAL -- THAT THE NEED FOR THESE JUDGES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE'VEHAD HISTORICALLY A LOT OF GROWTH IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE NOT SO MUCH IN OTHERS. AND THAT'S LEFT US WITH. SOME COURTS THAT ARE JUST COMPLETELY. OVER WORKED AND UNDER RESOURCE LIKE THE ONES IN RIVERSIDE AND SAN MARINO AND KERN. ARE THE ARE THE THREE BIGGEST SO. A I'M INTERESTED IN IS A QUESTION FOR THE LA -- I'M INTERESTED IN THE SENATE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BECAUSE I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT LANGUAGE AND WONDERING IF YOU HAVE SEEN THAT LANGUAGE IF YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE INTENT. OF THE LANGUAGES. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE LANGUAGE OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY'RE JUST DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE -- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE ARE THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PER PROPOSAL INCLUDES USING THAT USUAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH HAS BEEN THE HISTORICAL. METHOD FOR DOING AND THAT REALLY FOCUSES ON USING WORKLOAD AS THE BASIS FOR IT -- ACROSS THE STATE. OKAY START MISSILE. I'M COMFORTED THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT EITHER BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET IT. I AM. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT USING ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE PUTTING THEIR HANDS ON THIS ISSUE AND TURNING THIS INTO A POLITICAL FOOTBALL I THINK THAT ALLOWING THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ALLOCATE. THE JUDGES IS THE APPROPRIATE WAY OF DOING IT I THINK THE RELYING ON A JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT NONE OF US HAVE SEEN IS A FAIR WAY OF DOING IT BECAUSE NO ONE SECOND SAY FOR SURE. WHO WOULD GET WHAT AND -- SO I WOULD BE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF KEEPING IT THAT WAY INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE COMPLEX. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS SENATOR SKINNER ACTUALLY THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS NEEDS ASSESSMENT. HAS ALREADY NUMBERS SO IT IS NOT SOMETHING NO ONE HAS SEEN. AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF DEBATE. EVEN AMONGST. SOME MEMBERS NOT ALL OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AROUND. THE IT'S LIKE ANY ANY -- ANY TABLE ONE DEVELOPS OR ANY SET OF CRITERIA ONE DEVELOPS TO DETERMINE A WORKLOAD DEPENDS ON WHAT. OUR CRITERIA OR PUT IN THE MIX RIGHT. AND SO THERE IS SOME DEBATE AS TO WHETHER -- IT YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF WHETHER CERTAIN TYPE A TRIAL NEEDS HAVE BEEN. WAITED AS MUCH AS OTHERS AND WHICH CAN OF COURSE INFLUENCE THEN WHAT IS THE WORKLOAD IN THAT PARTICULAR. AREA -- NOW IF WE WERE OBVIOUSLY FINDING THE NUMBER OF JUDGES THAT. WOULD APPEAR MOST COUNTIES AND JUDGES -- JUDICIAL COUNCIL THINK IS NEEDED WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT WHETHER THE WORKLOAD. ASSESSMENT AS CURRENTLY CONSTRUED IS THE IS THE ONE THAT MOST REFLECTS THE NEED OR NOT BUT WHEN WE'RE ONLY FINDING TWENTY FIVE IT IS WORTH LOOKING AT THAT. YOU FOR THE COMMENT. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THE SIDE OF OPEN THANK YOU. FIFTY FIVE LEGAL AID FOR RENTERS IN LANDLORD TENANT DISPUTE LA JOH. GOVERNOR PROPOSED A ONE TIME TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION TO THE EQUAL ACCESS FUND TO SUPPORT LEGAL AID COSTS TO ASSIST WITH RENTAL DISPUTES BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. THERE WAS ASSOCIATED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROPOSED AS WELL. BOTH HOUSES APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT THE ASSEMBLY ALSO ADOPTED ADDITIONAL PLACEHOLDER BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE -- FOR IT WITH THE INTENT TO PROVIDE GREATER CLARITY ON THE USE OF THE FUNDING -- WE WOULD JUST NOTE TO THE EXTENT THAT IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS YOU THINK THAT GREATER FIND IT GREATER CLARITY IS NEEDED IN TERMS OF HOW THE FUNDING SHOULD BE IS OR HOW IT SHOULD GO OUT THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. FINANCE WE PERCEIVE THIS LANGUAGE JUST RECENTLY SO WE'RE CURRENTLY REVIEWING IT ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. WE THAT ITEM OPEN ISSUE SIX PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN IS SPEAKING. LA -- WHEN YOU'RE READY? I'M CURSING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN AND RESILIENCY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED SEVENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATE AND LOCAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PREPARING FOR IN RESPONDING. TO POWER SHUT OFF EVENTS -- AND THESE COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE I USE ARE EXPECTED TO DO MORE OF THESE PUBLIC THESE POWER SHUT DOWNS AS CONCERNS ABOUT WILD FIRES ARE ARE ON INCREASING AND IF THEY'RE TRYING TO REDUCE. A WILDFIRE RISK. TO THE SENATE APPROVED HALF OF THE FUNDING THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THIS PURPOSE AT FRIENDS AND APPROVED THE REMAINING HALF A PINE AND CONTINGENT. UPON RECEIPT OF A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND HOW THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE USED. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE PROPOSAL AND ADOPTED PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING SPECIFIED USES OF THE FUNDS AND REPORTING ON THE USE OF THE FUNDS AND THE OUTCOMES ACHIEVED. THE CONFERENCE ISSUE IS THE TIMING OF THE RELEASE OF THE FUNDS AS WELL AS THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. US WE THINK BOTH HOUSES ACTIONS WOULD INCREASE INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM AND THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON HOW THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED -- WE KNOW THAT THE TWO HOUSES APPROACHES ARE JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. SO ACCORDINGLY WE'RE RECOMMENDING A COMPROMISE THAT WOULD PROVIDE TWO KINDS OF REPORTS THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE REPORT EARLY ON IT COULD BE -- TRIGGERED BY SOME DATES -- OR THE EXPENSE CERTAIN EXPENDITURE LEVEL FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD REQUIRED TO REPORT OUT FRONT -- AND THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN FOR HOW -- HOW HE INTENDS TO USE THE FUNDS AND THEN SECOND WE WOULDRECOMMEND A REPORT AFTER THE FACT THAT IDENTIFIES HOW THE FUNDS WERE USED AND ALSO THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE ACHIEVED? ADDITIONALLY WE THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS A CLEAR IDEA OF HOW IT ONCE THESE FUNDS TO GO OUT FOR EXAMPLE HOW MUCH TO LOCALS VERSUS STATE ENTITIES -- IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE REASONABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE THAT DIRECTION -- AT THIS TIME AS WELL. THANK YOU FINANCE WE BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE NATUREOF THIS PROPOSAL IN THE FACT THAT IT IS A NEW PROPOSAL THAT FLEXIBILITY IS IMPORTANT AND WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF ON HOW TO BALANCE THAT NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. SOUNDS GOOD QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS [inaudible] SEE NONE. ALL THE ADAM OPEN ISSUE SEVEN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES LA OUT. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND FEDERAL FUNDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS WELL AS NINETY FOUR POSITIONS. TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES RELATED TO DISASTER PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE US THEIR THREE ONGOING ACTIVITIES THREE MAIN CATEGORIES OF ONGOING ACTIVITIES OR HER MORE PROPOSED. THE FIRST IS BASICALLY A BASELINE STAFFING INCREASE FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- AND SO THAT'S FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF ON GOING GENERAL FUND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND A FEDERAL TEST FIND THE FORTY AND SEVENTY SIX POSITIONS. THE SECOND IS TO PROVIDE A STATEWIDE DISASTER RESERVE CORPS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED AND ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A GENERAL FUND AND SIX POSITIONS -- AND THEN THIRD -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED CREATING A MISSION TASKING FIND AND HAVING STAFFING -- TO COORDINATE AND TRACK THAT MISSION TASKING FINDS A AND SO THAT FUNDING TERROR COORDINATING TRACK THAT FIND WAS. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWELVE POSITIONS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. I SAID THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDED ONE TIME FUNDING TO ESTABLISH THAT FUND OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS -- IN MOST RESPECTS THE TWO HOUSES ACTUALLY TOOK VERY SIMILAR ACTIONS WITH REGARD TO THIS PROPOSAL I SPECIFICALLY BOTH HOUSES APPROVED THE BASELINE FUNDING INCREASES AND THEY ALSO BOTH INCREASE. APPROVED TO THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH THAT MISSION TASKING FRIENDS -- ALSO BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THE POSITIONS AND ASSOCIATED -- FINDING RELATED TO THIS STATEWIDE DISASTER RESERVE CORPS AND ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIREMARIE REQUIRING REPORTING ON THE MISSION TASKING FUNDS. TO REALLY THEM THE DIFFERENCE -- BUT THE TWO HOUSES HAD WAS RELATED TO THE POSITIONS -- FOR ADMINISTERING THAT MISSION TASKING FUNDS TO THE SENATE APPROVED ALL TWELVE POSITIONS AND THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED HALF THE POSITIONS OF SIX OUT OF TWELVE POSITIONS. THE CONFERENCE ISSUE BEFORE YOU WITH THE STAFFING AND ASSOCIATED FUNDING -- WITH THAT MISSION TASKING UNIT. WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE ASSEMBLY APPROACH ON THIS WE THINK TWELVE POSITIONS APPEARS TO BE A RICHER STAFFING LEVEL THEN -- IS MERITED FOR THAT -- THAT THOSE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE MISSION TASKING FIND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING SOME OR ALL OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS -- THESE POSITIONS ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS GIVEN THE LIMITED TURNING TERM NATURE OF THE FUND ITSELF. THANK YOU FINANCE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. THIRTY NINE THE AUTOMOBILE LEFT OPEN ISSUE EIGHT INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN UNDER THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. SO THIS WAS AN AND A AN ADDITION MADE BY THE ASSEMBLY THE GOVERNOR AND SENATE DIDN'T HAVE PROPOSALS IN THIS AREA. THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATED TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ON GOING GENERAL FUND FOR THE INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN TASK FORCE. THIS IS A THAT IS A TASK FORCE THAT'S THAT INCLUDES FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES THE INTENT IS REALLY TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SPORTSMAN AGENCIES ARE EQUIPPED TO INVESTIGATE CHILD'S CRIMES -- AND CONDUCT OTHER ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES AS A CONFERENCE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR THAT TASK FORCE -- WE WOULD KNOW THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED AB FUNDING FOR THIS -- THIS ACTIVITY IN SOME PAST YEARS -- ALTHOUGH I TO SOME A LOWER AMOUNT. THANK YOU FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE SENATE ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. MEMBERS. SEE NO COMMENT LEVY ADAM OPEN ISSUE NINE JUSTICE HUMAN RESOURCES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. LA -- WHEN YOU'RE READY? THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS -- FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN VARIOUS SPECIAL FUNDS IN -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A CENTRALIZED EMPLOYEE HUMAN RESOURCES TRAFFIC KINGS THAT TRACKING SYSTEM. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVE THE PROPOSAL OF THE SENATE REJECTED THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY WHICH IS NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS WAS A PRIORITY THIS WOULD ALLOW DOJ. TO ADOPT A MORE FORMALIZED SYSTEM TO MORE EFFICIENTLY TRACK THEIR HUMAN RESOURCES MEANS. FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY ACTION. THANK YOU [inaudible] MEMBERS. SEE NO COMMENT. THE ITEM WILL BE LEFT OPEN. MOVING ON TO ISSUE TEN ARMED IMPROVE IT PERSISTS SYSTEM HELLO. THIS IS ONE WHERE YOU HAVE A HAND OUT IN YOUR BINDER AND WE WILL GO THROUGH HIS HAND OUT JUST TO MAKE CLEAR -- WHERE THE DIFFERENCES ARE OKAY? SO ON PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE'RE FIRST GOING TO FOCUS ON THE ARM THE APPS INVESTIGATION TEAMS THEMSELVES. THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN PROPOSED A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION AN ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO FULLY SHIFT SUPPORT AND APPS TO THE GENERAL FUND AND SO THIS INCLUDES THEIR EXISTING SUPPORT. ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION AS WELL AS A FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION TO SUPPORT TWENTY SIX NEW POSITIONS. BOTH OF THE HOUSES -- ADOPTED OR APPROVED THE ONE ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FND AUGMENTATION TO SHIFT IT FULLY OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND -- BUT THAT'S THAT'S ABOUT IT. THE SENATE PLAN DOES PROVIDE THE GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION ON A ONE TIME BASIS WHILE THE ASSEMBLY PLANT US ON ON ON GOING BASIS SO THAT'S THE FIRST DIFFERENCE THERE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT -- THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED AND BOTH HOUSES APPROVED ESSENTIALLY SPLIT FUNDING THAT DROVE THE SECTION AT DOJ AND THIS IS REALLY TO HELP MAINTAIN THE SOLVENCY OF THE TRUST ACCOUNT. MOVING DOWN THAT PAGE -- THE GOVERNOR DID NOT INCLUDE ANY FUNDING FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT BOTH HOUSES APPROVED A THREE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION TO SUPPORT ONE FORSMAN AGENCY ACTIVITIES AND FOR COUNTIES. RELATED TO SIMILAR APPS TYPE ACTIVITIES. AND THEN THE FINAL PIECE ON THIS PAGE IS RELATED TO REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- BOTH HOUSES APPROVED LANGUAGE REQUIRING THAT THE FUNDINGFOR THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT -- THE AGENCIES REPORT ON HOW THE FUNDS WERE USED IN ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE USE OF THOSE DOLLARS. AND THEY ALSO REQUIRE JUST ANNUAL REPORTING ON APPS INVESTIGATION TEAM WORKLOAD WE WOULDN'T OUT ON THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT DOJ HAS HAD TO DO BUT THE REPORTING LANGUAGE EXPIRED -- ADDITIONALLY THE SENATE PLAN ALSO REQUIRES DOJ ASSESS THE HEALTH OF THE DRUGS THE SPECIAL ACCOUNT AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENTERING AT RED REMAIN SOLVENT AND THAT'S GONNA BE THE SECOND MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES. SO IN THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT PAGE THREE WE DO HAVE A COMPROMISE ON THIS ISSUE -- IT WOULD BE TO APPROVE THIS FAMILIES OVERALL PLAN WITH THE ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- APPROVED BY THE SENATE SO THIS WOULD PROVIDE ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THE APP'S INVESTIGATION TEAMS JUST TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING FUNDING LEVELS ARE MAINTAINED -- AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE REPORTING LANGUAGE OF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD GET A REPORT ASSESSING THE HEALTH OF THE DRESS ACCOUNT AND THIS WOULD REALLY HELP INFORM THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS OF WHAT ACTIONS IF ANY. NEED TO BE TAKEN ON A RELATED TO SOLVENCY. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FINANCE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM A REVISION PROPOSAL. THANK YOU WE'LL START WITH SENATOR ROSS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW -- EVERY YEAR WE SEEM TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE IN FUNDING AND BACKLOGS IN HOW WE'RE GOING TO CLEAR UP THE BACKLOG AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO PICK UP THESE FIREARMS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THEM. AND WE ARE COMMITTED THE DOJ BUDGETS AND ALLOW THEM TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE. AND I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN TELL ME I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE EVER BEEN ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF THE BOW WAVE. AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. BUT WHY DO WE KEEP DOING IT THE SAME WAY. WILL BECOME PROHIBITED PERSONS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE COURT SYSTEM OR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM AT SOME POINT. AND SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THEM THE PROHIBITS THEM FROM POSSESSING A FIREARM. WE WAIT UNTIL ALL THAT HAPPENS AND THEY DISAPPEAR INTO THE ETHER. AND THEN WE THROW MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE DOJ WHO SENDS OUT A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE. OUT OVER THIS HUGE STATE WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE TO TRY TO FIND THESE FOLKS AND PICK UP FIREARMS. WHY IS IT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WHEN THEY CYCLE THROUGH? OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE WE GRABBED THE FIREARMS FROM THEM. BEFORE THEY LEAVE OUR SITE. AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE BACKLOG EXCEPT TO TRY TO WHITTLE IT DOWN. BUT MAYBE IT'S IN HERE AND I DON'T KNOW BUT MY PERCEPTION IS THERE'S NOTHING THEY WERE DOING AT THE FRONT END. TO TRY TO PREVENT THE BACKLOG. FROM OCCURRING. CAN CAN CAN SOMEONE [inaudible] ADDRESS THAT. IS IT BEING STUDIED IS A PLAN BEING DEVELOPED. IN MY OFF THE MARK -- AMADOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK -- I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS WITH THIS AND I THINK THAT -- ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS NEW REPORT THAT THEY'VE AN ISSUE WHERE THEY REFINED THEIR APPS REVIEW LOOKED AT THE BACKLOG I THINK THEY HAVE CONCERNS AS WELL ABOUT -- WHAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE? WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON BUT LET ME BE MORE SPECIFIC. IF YOU'RE IN THE COURTS OF I DIDN'T DO CIVILIAN CRIMINAL LAW BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS IF YOU'RE IN THE COURT SYSTEM. AND YOU'RE IN A COURTROOM AND A JUDGE AND YOU'VE GOT A PLEA DEAL OR JUDGES ABOUT THE SENTENCE YOU. YOU'RE GONNA KNOW WHEN THE U. S. AS THE BECAUSE THE ACCUSED ARE GOING TO KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE ABLE TO POSSESS FIREARMS AND I MAY EVEN BE SOME ORDER THAT THE JUDGE SIGNS. WHY IS IT WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL LEAVES THE COURTROOM? HAVING ACCEPTED THE PLEA DEAL EITHER BEFORE SENTENCING -- AT THE TIME OF SENTENCING THAT THERE'S NOT SOMEBODY COLLECTING THOSE FIREARMS AT THAT POINT. AND THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE FOR SOMEBODY TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE I SUSPECT THAT THE COST OF DOING THAT THE INCREMENTAL COST TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THE JUDICIARY. IS GOING TO BE A HECK OF A LOT LESS THAN IT IS. DOING IT ON THE BACKEND WHERE THEY FALL INTO THE BACKLOG WE HIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATORS ONE FORCE FROM PEOPLE WATCHING AND PLANES AND CARS. TO TO GO HOUSE TO HOUSE TRYING TO FIND FOLKS. I'LL STOP GIVING A SPEECH BUT A WE HEAR THE YOU KNOW AND NO. I'M NOT CRITICIZING BUT THAT'S THE SAME ISSUE EVERY YEAR. AND WE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH A NEW PLAN [inaudible] TO GRAB. WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU MA'AM SURE SENATOR SKINNER. FOLLOWED BY CENTER NIELSEN CENTER SKINNER [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SO. A COUPLE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE ITEM THE FORCE FIRST ACTUALLY DOJ HAS DONE A VERY DECENT JOB ON GETTING -- MAKING PROGRESS ON THAT BACKLOG. AND CONSIDERING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- APPROVED ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION THAT IS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE PUT ON THE ARM TO IMPROVE IT A PERSON'S LAST -- THE IN TERMS OF THE BACKLOG QUESTION. IT'S WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. NOW BE WHAT. THE ARE. SUB FIVE IN THE SENATE DON'T WITH AFTER. DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE AND HAVE BEING BOTH IN FOR INFORMATION HEARINGS AND HEARINGS ON THE PARTICULAR BCP'S. IS THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE BUDGETS WE'VE APPROVED HAVE INCREASED FUNDING AND POSITIONS TO DOJ TO DEAL WITH APPS. NOW THE POSITIONS AT DOJ HAVE NOT THEY'VE GONE ON FILLED NOT ALL. BUT THERE CONTINUES TO BE VACANCY AND WHAT WE HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT SOME OF THAT IS DUE. TO EITHER AT THE CLASSIFICATION OF THOSE POSITIONS FOR SOME COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ISSUES I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE. BUT BASICALLY THEIR ABILITY TO EITHER HIRE PEOPLE RETAIN PEOPLE IT CHALLENGING NOW GIVEN ACT. IT SEEMED TO US AND THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE COULD FIX JUST WITH A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THAT IF WE CONTINUED TO GIVE NEW FUNDING FOR NEW POSITIONS JUST HAPPEN VACANT I MEAN THE FUNDING WE GAVE LAST YEAR THOSE POSITIONS ARE VACANT. SO WE LOOKED AT THE FACT THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THE THE WITH RETRIEVAL OF WEAPONS FROM FOLKS WHO ARE ON THIS PROHIBITED PERSONS IST. HAS BEEN IN CAN BE THERE'S NOTHING IN OUR STATUTE THE PREVENTS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM DOING THIS AND IN FACT. MANY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE HAPPY TO BECAUSE IT ASSIST THEM ADDITIONALLY. THAT. IF IN GIVEN THAT WE HAVE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE. AND IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO BRING DOJ UP TO THE LEVEL OF STAFFING TO GIVE THEM I MEAN THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN GIVE THEM THE TYPE OF PHYSICAL OR GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE THAT OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HOUSE. SO WE FELT THAT. KNOWING THAT WE'RE PUTTING MORE PEOPLE IN THE ARMED -- IMPROVE THE PERSON'S LIST. AND THAT DOJ'S HAD DIFFICULTY. FILLING POSITIONS THAT WE NEEDED TO EXPAND ME BE MORE CREATIVE SO WHILE WE DID NOT. ENTERTAIN WHAT -- MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR ROTH JUST RECOMMENDED AND CERTAINLY THAT SOMETHING IS WORTH US LOOKING AT NEXT YEAR. WE DID LOOK AT WELL WHO ELSE CAN HELP US WITH THIS WORK LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WE KNOW IN THE PAST I MEAN EVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED MONEY TO OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN MY OWN DISTRICT -- FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GAVE THE CITY OF OAKLAND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY A COUPLE YEARS AGO. TO TO BASICALLY. RETRIEVE WEAPONS FROM EVERYBODY THAT WAS ON THE APPS LIST THAT HAD AN ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH OAKLAND THAT YOU KNOW HAVE. THE THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT THEY STILL WERE. HE HAD WEAPONS AND THAT GREAT THAT ASSISTED DOJ GREATLY OUR OWN DOJ ON TO WITHOUT BACK LIKE SO. KNOWING THAT WE HAVE BOTH THE INTEREST LOCALLY AND THE ABILITY LOCALLY IT SEEMS WE SHOULD. JOIN TOGETHER AND SO THAT WAS ONE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING THE THIS PILOT AND CERTAINLY. WE KNOW THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IT CAN WORK BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS DONE IN A WAY THAT ALSO COORDINATES WITH DOJ BECAUSE DOJ -- HAS INDICATED IN HEARINGS THAT THERE'S TIMES WHEN THEY DON'T HEAR FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN DAVE RETREAT WEAPONS BUT CERTAINLY THOSE ARE THINGS WE CAN PUT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND SUCH -- SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO CHEAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HOW. TO BE THE SMARTEST USE OF OUR RESOURCES AND ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS. ON NOW FINALLY WHY DID WE NOT CONTINUE GENERAL FUND ON GOING. THE FRUSTRATION HERE IS THAT. THE SPECIAL FUNDS SUCH AS THE DROSS ACCOUNT THE OTHERS WERE DESIGNED WE WE CREATED THESE FEES. TO SUPPORT THIS ACTIVITY. AND IF WE MOVE TO LONG TERM GENERAL FUND THEN WE'RE BASICALLY SET WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE FEES. SO WE WANTED. TO PUT IT BACK ON DOJ TO COME BACK TO US. BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADJUST THESE FEES AND WHAT WOULD BE THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY IN ORDER. TO BRING IN THE MONEY IS NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT IT TO TO BASICALLY FULLY IMPLEMENT OUR APPS PROGRAM. SO WE DID NOT WANT. TO ROOF A LONG TERM GENERAL FUND AND GET EVERYBODY USED TO OR DEPENDENT ON USING GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PURPOSE WHEN WE HAVE SPECIAL FUNDS. SO I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ALEJO'S COMPROMISE ONLY BECAUSE USUALLY THE LA ALWAYS REMINDING US OF THE FACT THAT WHEN WE HAVE A GENERAL FUND. WE SHOULD BE RELYING ON GENERAL FUND AS MUCH I MEAN. WHEN WE HAVE A SPECIAL FIND WE SHOULD BE RELYING ON SPECIAL FUND FOR THAT PURPOSE AND IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE SPECIAL FUNDS SHOULD BE? MAKING THE APPROPRIATE JUST MEANT TO CORRECT IT SO THAT'S WHERE THE SENATE WAS COMING FROM. AND CERTAINLY WE WANT OUR APPS PROGRAM TO ABSOLUTELY WORK BUT WE ARE TRYING. TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHIC SIZE OF OUR STATE [inaudible] WORKING [inaudible] ON YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. DOES ANYONE OUT THERE KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT BACKLOG IS. THE NUMBERS OF NOW. WHEN WESAY THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RING TRUE WITH THE% NUMBER BECAUSE MANY OF THESE? INMATES HAVE MORE THAN ONE WEAPON. BUT IF SAFE. THE LAST FIGURE I HEARD WENT FROM TWENTY ONE THOUSAND AND ABOUT TWO YEARS. TO TEN THOUSAND WHERE ARE WE TODAY. NUMBERS HAVE BEEN INCREASING TO SOME DEGREE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY I DON'T THINK BUT WHAT WHAT'S THE NUMBER OF ON ON THE CONFISCATED FIREARMS TODAY. MANY. CURRENT BUT THE NUMBER. I THINK THE LAST NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE ARE FROM THE APPS REPORT THAT THEY DID IN JANUARY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. AND SO IN THAT REPORT -- I THINK THAT THEY'RE A COUPLE NUMBERS MENTION SO ALL KIND OF SPLIT THAT APART -- THERE WERE NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR ACTIVE CASES AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PENDING CASES -- THE TEN THOUSAND NUMBER I THINK -- YOU'RE REFERENCING TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE INDIVIDUALS WERE REMOVED FROM APPS -- AND THEN BUT ELEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE ADDED TO ABSENT SO. THERE'S KIND OF MOVEMENT BOTH IN AND OUT. BUT I DON'T I'M NOT GETTING A HEAD WE'RE GETTING BEHIND. EIGHT IN THAT LONG IN WORKING WITH DOJ ON THIS ON THIS B. C. P. AND ALSO RELATED TO THIS MOST RECENT REPORTING I THINK THAT THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT. HOW THE DATA WAS IDENTIFIED AND HOW IT WAS BROKEN DOWN SO TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE ON SOME OF THE PENDING CASES? THEY WERE ABLE TO KIND OF FURTHER BREAK IT OUT INTO THINGS LIKE -- WHERE THEY WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE INDIVIDUAL THE INDIVIDUALS OUT OF STATE OR IF THE ONLY PROHIBITION WAS RELATED TO A FEDERAL PROHIBITION WAS SEWED? STATE DOJ DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A FORTY OVER THAT AND AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT BOTH HOUSES TOOK ON IN ADOPTING THE REPORTING LANGUAGE WAS TO ENSURE THAT THAT INFORMATION STILL CAME IN. AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD KEEP MONITORING IT AND COULD DECIDE WHAT TO DO IN. SUBSEQUENT YEARS WITH THAT DATA THE TROUBLE IS MA'AM EVERY YEAR WE'VE GOTTEN DIFFERENT VERSIONS OKAY. LAST YEAR THE BIG REASON. THAT THE BACKLOG WE PUT IN AT LEAST UP WELL OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD AND WE'RE IT WAS REPRESENTED BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE. BY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT'LL GET RID OF THE BACKLOG IT DIDN'T. THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH THE BACKLOG. WHAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS? WE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE CANNOT COMPETE. FOR EMPLOYEES FOR SWORN OFFICERS WITH PRIVATE. EXCUSE ME WITH WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CHAU THOUGH WE HAVE THE MONEY. WE CAN'T FIND ANYBODY TO HIGHER SO THAT WAS A REASON. THAT WAS OFFERED UP. AND SO THEY DIDN'T GET HIRED. WELL WE ACTUALLY TRIED THIS PILOT. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST YEAR IT WAS PUT IN THE BUDGET FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I INSISTED ON IF YOU CAN'T DO IT LET'S GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO CAN MAYBE DO IT. LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THAT MONEY DID NOT GET SPENT. THAT WAS PRETTY OFFENSIVE LAST YEAR TO FIND THAT OUT WE PUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FIVE MILLION. TO HELP GIVE IT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU GO DO IT THEN. THAT DIDN'T GET SPENT. PARDON THE TWENTY SIXTH. AND TWENTY I'M SURE THAT WAS TWENTY SIXTEEN NOT [inaudible] SEVENTY OR EIGHTEEN SO WE HAVE JUST POURED DOLLARS IN. THAT MADE NO REAL HEADWAY. AND THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR YOU TO COME BACK AGAIN THIS YEAR AND SAY JUST ABOUT THE SAME THING THE BIG SAID JUST DIDN'T KNOW ONCE IT'S DIFFERENT OKAY. THE NEW WATCH IT. THIS YEAR IT'S NOT BEEN BROUGHT UP THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY TO HIRE. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY AS MUCH. AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE BOTTOM LINE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE ILL SERVED. BY THIS INCOMPETENCE. AND I THINK THE FAILURE OF THE LEGISLATURE NOT TO BE FIRM ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT THESE THESE GUNS COULD CONFISCATE. WE JUST SIT AROUND TALK ABOUT IT EVERY YEAR THROUGH A BUNCH OF WORDS UP IN THE AIR. AND REPEAT THE SAME OLD THING. THE FOLLOWING YEAR. SO IN EUROPE ENTREATIES ARE FALLING ON DEAF EARS HERE FOLKS. AND I RATHER PREDICT THAT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR. THE SAME COMMITTED. WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME KIND-OF OBVIOUS CATIONS [inaudible] AND REPRESENTATIONS. AND VERY FEW IF ANY RESULT. NOW AND MAYBE YOU NEED TO GET SOME EXPERTS IN THAT KNOW HOW TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT GETTING THERE BY THE CURRENT. TECHNIQUES MONEY SPENT. AND DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCES. THIRTY NIELSEN BEFORE I OPEN UP TO CENTER MORE LIKE I JUST WANTED TO READ A DOCUMENT THAT BUDGET. COMMITTEE STAFF HAS. IN AN EFFORT TO ANSWER YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION ABOUT THE NUMBER ON THE BACK LOG THEIR QUOTES. AND SO A TOTAL OF 230-002-0020 TWO IN THE APPS DATABASE AS OF FEBRUARY. TWENTY NINETEEN THERE BROKE DOWN THE FOLLOWING WAY. ACTIVE ONGOING CASES NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR SIXTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE ARE FEDERAL BRADY PROHIBITIONS ORIGINAL BACKLOG. FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IT WAS. TWENTY THOUSAND AS OF MARCH THIRTIETH OF TWENTY NINETEEN BECAUSE THESE NUMBERS I GAVE YOU WERE FEBRUARY. ACCORDING TO THE DOJ THERE WAS NO BACKLOG. AS OF MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN RELIEF TO GIVE ME GIVE ME GIVE ME ONE MORE THAN YOU. PENDING CASES. WITHIN PENDING CASES THERE ARE SUB CATEGORIES APPROXIMATELY. THIRTEEN THOUSAND OF THIS SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED ARE COLD UNABLE TO CLEAR. THAT WAS THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. TO BUDGET COMMITTEE AS OF MARCH. THIRTY THEY SAY THERE WAS NO BACKLOG. WELL I FIND THAT ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE. MADAM CHAIR. BASED ON ALL THE DATA THAT I HAVE REVIEWED I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. IT'S STILL A FIRM JUST ABOUT TEN THOUSAND OUT THERE THAT. THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT. AND THAT'S STILL UNACCEPTABLE BUT THE POINT IS. WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN. WE JUST DON'T HAVE A PLAN THIS IS NOT A PLAN [inaudible] COME BACK. A COUPLE DAYS WITH THE PLAN. WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. FOR THIS ONE MORE STATEMENT -- SINCE 201-353-0001 HUNDRED AND ONE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM APPS AT THE SAME TIME 560-005-0050 SEVEN HAVE BEEN ADDED. IN 201-811-0003 HUNDRED FIFTY NEW PEOPLE AT IT AND TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED WERE TAKEN OFF. SENATOR MOORE Là. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WE PAID A VISIT ON OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL. YOU AND CENTER NIELSEN MYSELF EARLIER THIS YEAR AND A NICE RAINY DAY WE WENT OVER TO HIS OFFICE AND GIVE US A PREVIEW OF THE REPORT THAT HE WAS GOING TO ISSUE. A FEW HOURS OR DAYS LATER AND HE FOCUSED ON THREE SPECIFIC AREAS IN OUR DISCUSSION. ONE WAS THAT [inaudible] HE HIRES. INDIVIDUALS WITH COLLEGE DEGREES AND THE PAY SCALE THAT'S PROVIDED BY THE STATE. DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO PAY THESE INDIVIDUALS. COMPETITIVE SALARIES COMPARED TO OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THEY ALSO TOLD US THAT. HE WAS WORKING ON RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND HE ALSO TOLD US THAT THE SOFTWARE THAT THEY WERE USING WAS DEFICIENTAND NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED. IN THOSE WERE ALL PROVIDED IN HIS REPORT. BUT WHAT KICK MECHANIC YOU KNOW YOU AND I KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS BUT WHAT CAN IT CAME OUT. TO ME IS SAID. SEE THAT OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S NEW TO THE POSITION. HE'S NOT MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE HR PROCESS AT THE STATE. BECAUSE SOME OF THESE ISSUES YOU JUST NEED TO CHANGE THE PAY SCALES TO PAY GRADES THE NEED TO START DOING THAT INTERNALLY -- TO WORK WITH. YOU KNOW THE SECRETARY THAT YOU REPORT TO AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND TO SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE. NOT NECESSARILY NEEDED IN A BUDGET BILL IT'S JUST HATE LET'S HELP YOU BRING YOUR DEPARTMENT. YOU KNOW IT'S HELP HELP BECAUSE HE'S. PRESIDENT I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S EVER BEEN A DEPARTMENT HEAD BEFORE IT'S PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL IT A DEPARTMENT. SO HOW HOW DO WE GET HIM. TO MODIFY HIS PRIORITIES TO BE ABLE TO COMPENSATE. THESE. OFFICERS WHO HAVE TO GET THESE. FIREARMS HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET COMPETITIVE SO HE DOESN'T LOSE THEM TO OTHER AGENCIES -- AND SO SO HE NEEDS YOUR HELP THEIR I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS TO BE A BUDGET REQUEST. I HOPE WE NEED MORE STAFFING WE JUST NEED TO HELP HIM KEEP THE STEPPING. HE HE ALREADY HAS AND SO. WITH THAT I THINK. YOU KNOW WE WOULD DO EXAM I DON'T YOU KNOW WE GET TO ASSIST. A DEPARTMENT HEAD AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACCOMMODATE. THE DEFICIENCIES THAT HE'S INHERITED SO NOW. IT'S IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE MORE THAN I THINK BUDGETARY SO I THINK. SENATOR. MITCHELL AYE REAL FRUSTRATED OUTSIDE GOING WELL WHY IS TO BRING IN THIS IN FOR BUDGET ISSUE OR CUT MAKING ITS A BUDGET ISSUE AND IT'S REALLY TO ME MAYBE A LITTLE DIFFERENT. AND SO ARE WE GOING TO HELP HIM HELP HIMSELF IF THAT MAKES SENSE IN IN GIVING HIM. YOU KNOW JUST. YOU KNOW BY MENTORING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN YOU STEP INTO A DEPARTMENT HEAD POSITION I'VE BEEN THERE DONE THAT NURSES LOOK THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE -- BUT THE NUMBERS AT THE CHAIR HAS. CITED ARE ACCURATE. AND THEY'RE WORKING HARD BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT. HAVING A KEEPING THEIR MAINTAINING AT THE TEN THOUSAND LEVEL BUT THEY NEED. TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER. BUT HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE TO GET IN FRONT AS SENATOR ROBB IS REQUESTED AND WE DISCUSSED THAT WITH HIM WHEN HE CAME TO A SUB FIVE SENATOR WEEK WEEK WE BROUGHT THESE ISSUES UP WE HAD. FUN BUT I I DON'T KNOW THIS APPROACH IS THE RIGHT APPROACH BUT I THINK WITH WITH WE HAVE A SIMPLE FIX AND I THINK WE'RE SPENDING. MAYBE MAYBE NOT ATTACKING IT THE WAY THAT THAT IT COULD BE DONE IN A PROPER FASHION SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR LETTING ME. SIX OF NICE. TO KNEEL TO THIS LITTLE TOO LIKE GOING. TO THE NICE. WITH ALL MY FRUSTRATION. I GIVES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CREDIT. BECAUSE I ALSO HAD -- THEN INDIVIDUAL BREAKFAST WITH HIM I LIKE HIM I THINK HE'S VERY SINCERE. BUT AND WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH HIM I MEAN THAT THIS IS FRUSTRATED AS I AM. I'D BE HAPPY. TO WORK WITH HIM. TO AFFECT SOME OF CHANGE. BUT IT WILL REQUIRE THAT WE EVERY SINGLE DAY FROM NOW UNTIL NEXT YEAR. ARE WORKING IN SOME MANNER WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO GET THESE GUNS PICKED UP. THERE NEEDS TO BE A PLAN. PUT BENCHMARKS SOMEBODY DIRECTING IT. OVERSEEING AT AND THE LEGISLATURE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN MONITORING. MR TING DESERVE A QUESTION WITH THE FILES. WE JUST THEM SERVER COMMITTEE THE SOLUTION WAS YOUR PROPOSAL. BUT PUT ON THE SPOT TO STARTED TO REPEAT MYSTIFIES CARRIERS WELL. IF IF HIT IT BECAUSE THIS. SEGMENT OF HIS DEPARTMENT IS THE VISION WHICH IS. YOU KNOW THAT THEY ACTUALLY DRIVE OUT AND VISIT THESE HOMES WHICH THAT'S A SCARY JOB. TO SHOW UP AT AHOUSE THAT THING CAN I HAVE YOUR GUN. IT'S TO TALK ABOUT -- THEIR PAY SCALE IS LOWER THAN THAT OF WHAT. WOULD BE PAID BY SOMEONE AT A POLICE DEPARTMENT OR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SO SO HE I CRIED I BELIEVE HE NEEDS TO WORK WITH. HR AND AND AND UPDATE THE PAY SCALE CHART FOR THOSE POSITIONS NOW THAT SHOULD BE DONE INTERNALLY. BETWEEN HIS DEPARTMENT AND NEWMAN RELATION GIVEN RESOURCE. MAKES SENSE. ARMY JUST JUST TO FINISH WHAT. SENATOR. SENATOR MITCHELL RAT -- OF THE THE TEN THOUSAND SO WHO WERE TAKEN OFF. ON THE WAS REALLY ONLY DISARMED. SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT WERE TAKEN OUT BECAUSE THEIR MISSION EXPIRED. IN THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE DIED SO AGAINST 60% OF THE TEN THOUSAND TAKEN OFF WERE ACTUALLY REMOVED NOT BECAUSE OF THEY WERE DISARMED BUT THEY NO LONGER PROHIBITED. ON IT THE DAY TO GIVE -- I I WOULD I WOULD HOPE AT LEAST FOR SENATOR NIELSEN COMES AYE AYE IS MUCH THE SAME COMMON TERMS OF THIS GETS DONE THIS GETS DISCUSSED -- EVERY SINGLE YEAR THIS IS MY FOURTH CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I THINK WE DISCUSSED EACH OF THOSE HE TO THOSE FOUR YEARS -- THE ONE THING THAT DOES GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE AGAIN WAS. HAVING THIS LOCAL PILOT. HAVING COUNTIES AND AND THE WAY THE COUNTIES WERE IDENTIFIED IS. THE SHERIFF OF THOSE COUNTIES WERE INTERESTED IN IN DOING SO THIS IS AGAIN NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE. TELLING PEOPLE BUT THAT WE ARE ASKING IF THERE ARE ANY VOLUNTEERS AND YOU HAD SOME COUNTIES WERE WILLING TO VOLUNTEER. AND I THINK THOSE COUNTIES FELT VERY COMFORTABLE BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY DOING THIS. TO ACTIVELY PUTTING INFORMATION TO THE DATABASE. THEY ARE ALSO -- ALREADY -- DO THIS AS PART OF THEIR DAILY WORK WITH THEY ARE DISARMING INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR OWN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- MY HOPE MY NO NO NO THIS THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF CONTENTION OF THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND MY HOPE IS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE DEPARTMENT WILL REALLY. KIND OF WORK WORK WITH US WORK WITH THOSE COUNTIES TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO REALLY LEVERAGE OUR STRENGTH AS A STATE AND REALLY LEVERAGE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ALREADY THERE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK IT'S THIS IS THE SHOULD REALLY BE A STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIP. WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOALS. WE ALL WANT TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AND DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO AGAIN HAVE THIS ONLY CENTRALIZED IN. SACRAMENTO MAKES SENSE TO REALLY BE WORKING WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO GET THE BEST RESULTS SO THAT THE HOPE IS THAT AGAIN -- SPOKE WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT REALLY WOULD HOPE. THAT AT SOME POINT HE KEY IN THE DEPARTMENT COOPER THE COME AROUND. TO REALLY WORKING WITH -- LOCALS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY THANK YOU. DOCTOR WEBER. YES I THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE THAT COMES UP I HAS COME UP FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROW AND SO -- CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I DISCOVERED IN MY CONVERSATION WITH THE WITH THE AG WAS THAT. YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS APPEARS TO BE A SITUATION THAT CONTINUES TO GROW AND IT CONTINUES TO GROW BECAUSE WE KEEP ADDING PEOPLE TO THE LIST SO I DOUBT IF WE'LL EVER GET TO ZERO LIST. OF IF YOU LOOK AT IT BECAUSE WHAT FOR EVER IN TERMS OF THE COURTS. ISSUING THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND SO AS A RESULT YOU KEEP MOVING YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A LARGER LIST WHICH IT BUT AS I SAID SO MANY COMES OFF ANOTHER GROUP GOES ON SO YOU'VE GOT THAT GOING -- ADDITIONALLY THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION AND I THINK -- AS I LISTEN -- TO SOME OF YOUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ACTUALLY MAKING OR FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO TO CAPTURE OR TO GET THE WEAPONS BEFORE WHILE YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE THERE. WHAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THEM WITH IT'S A CONDITION OF RELEASE OR WHATEVER MAY BE -- THAT WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO OF MAKE IT THE JOB MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE WITH ACTIVE AFTER THEY'RE GONE FROM THE CORNER WHERE THEY ARE. THEN WE GO LOOKING FOR THEM AND THEIR WEAPONS AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND IT MAKES IT FAR MORE COMPLICATED. THAN IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE SO YOU KNOW WE MAY WANT TO LOOK AT SOMETHING OF THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN AND WE WANT TO LOOK AT SOME SOME PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT. CAN FALLING ON THAT LIST IF THERE'S SOME OTHER KIND OF STIPULATIONS IN TERMS OF COLLECTING THE WEAPONS BEFORE THE PEOPLE ARE LEFT TO TO LEAVING TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW YOU'VE GOT A MAJOR PROBLEM. IS YOU HAVE TO GO FIND WHEN YOU HAD ACCESS TO THEM AND THEY COULD HAVE HAD THE FOLKS BRING THEIR WEAPONS IN BEFORE THEY EVEN GAVE HIM THE ABILITY TO BE RELEASED. OF FROM WHATEVER CAPACITY OR WHEREVER THEY WERE IF THEY WERE SO THOSE KIND OF THINGS I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT IS MAKES A A DIFFICULT JOB TO BE DONE -- BUT DOES IN OUR COMPASS MY CONVERSATION WITH -- THE AG CLEARLY THEY'RE MOVING FOR BUT IT'S IT'S A CONSTANT MOVING TARGET BECAUSE THEY KEEP ADDING TO THE LIST. AND THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE -- AS YOU POINT OUT THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS JOB. OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU GO AND LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE GUNS AND WEAPONS AND SO YOU HAVE TO FIGURE HAS STRATEGICALLY YOU GET IT WITHOUT GETTING SOMEBODY HURT. AND THAT'S AND THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE THAT SEVERE AND I THINK COORDINATION WITH THE COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO EXIST BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT. JOB IF YOU ARE COUNTY YOU DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO INTO ANOTHER COUNTY SO THESE PEOPLE TAKE THIS STUFF AND RUN ACROSS COUNTY LINES. IS THE IGGY THAT CAN GO GET THEM L. BUT BUT YOU CAN'T GO GET THEM A FEW FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTY SO THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WERE COORDINATION BECOMES A VERY IMPORTANT THAT. YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEN THE COUNTY IS LIMITED IN ITS WHAT YOU CAN COLLECTED. BUT THE WORKING WITH DEAL JAY THEY CAN THEN OBVIOUSLY STILL MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF MEAT. FOUR FOUR OF CORD NATION OF THIS BUT IT'S A VERY MUCH MORE COMPLICATED WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE LIST AND TERMS OF A TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE ON THE LIST AND HOW LONG THE STATE ON HIS LIST. AND THEN SOME OF THEM ARE STILL ON THE LIST IN AN OPENING STATUS OR WHATEVER SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'VE COLLECTED OF MOST OF THE GUNS WE COULDN'T FIND THE OTHER ONE IT'S SOMEBODY LOST SOMEWHERE WHERE BUT WAS AND SO THE PROCESS. FIVE AND SIX GUNS AND YOU CLICK FIVE OF THEM BOB THAT ONE IS THEIR KEEPS YOU ON THE LIST. AND AND SO THAT'S WHAT SOME OF THESE CASES ARE PENDING BECAUSE THE THE THE GUN IS. BEEN DESTROYED SOMETHING'S HAPPENED PERSONS GUNS BY STICKING ACOSTA A LINE WHATEVER MAYBE AND SO YOU CAN'T FIND IT EVEN THOUGH YOU PUT ENERGY AND TIME IN TRYING TO COLLECTED WITH THIS PERSON. THE ONLY FILE FOUND FIVE OF THE GUNS AND THEY WERE REALLY ANOTHER ONE SOMEWHERE ELSE SOLD IT'S IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING WE START LOOKING AT THE LIST THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING BUT THERE'S A LOT OF MOVEMENT THAT'S GOING ON WITHTHIS COLLECTION. AND BUT I THINK AT THE SAME TIME THEIR LOT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN COORDINATION WITH IT AND SO I I LOOK AT THAT. CONCERNING THE ISSUE OF SALARIES AS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE IN THE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO GET OF FOLKS PARTICULARLY EVEN EVEN JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO OF THE LEGAL SIDE IT'S HARD TO GET. OTHER PEOPLE TO COME AND TO STAY BECAUSE WE LIMITED IN OUR PAY SCALE IN AND WHAT WE HAVE AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S MUCH OF THIS IF YOU GET A LOT MORE LEAVE IN YOUR WITH SOME LAW FIRM OR IF YOU GO BECOME. SOMEONE A DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHATEVER MAY BE YOU THEN END UP MAKING MORE MONEY SO IT'S THAT HE'S HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. KEEPING THE STAFF THAT HE HAS ATTRACTED GOOD STAFF AND KEEPING IT BECAUSE OF WHAT OUR PAY SCALE LOOKS LIKE AS THE STATE PAYS GILBERT'S ANYTHING ELSE WE FIND THAT TO BE TRUE WITH THIS IN IT OR WHATEVER IT IS. THAT IT'S HARD TO TRACK PEOPLE TO WORK FOR THE STATE UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TO WORK FOR THE STATE BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THE SKILLS THE TRAINING HERE AND THEN GO OFF AND MAKE. TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE MONEY DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND OFF AND SOLD THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT -- IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAVE THAT BUT THEY REALLY DON'T IN TERMS OF THE PAY SCALE THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY THAT THE BUDGET THAT WE GIVE TO THEM. IT ALSO PUTS LIMITATIONS ON THEM SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET IN AND WHAT IS WHAT TO COME FROM COME FROM US SO IF WE DON'T START INCREASING SALARIES WE HAVE STUDIED CREASING BUDGETS. AND SO. YOU KNOW SO IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A DIFFICULT TASK TO TO MANAGE AND SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT EIGHT TO ARE GETTING TOGETHER IN WRITING A DESCRIPTION AND GIVING MORE MONEY. YOU HAD TO GET YET FIND WITH MONIES CAN COME FROM ANY OBVIOUSLY FROM US. SO [inaudible] BUT ANYWAY. GOOD GOOD CONVERSATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEIR ANY IF THERE AREN'T ANY MORE COMMENTS WILL. HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. TO RETURN. TO ISSUE ELEVEN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AGAIN WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LA -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND TWO POINT NINE MILLION FROM THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW FUND AS WELL AS TWENTY POSITIONS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY IT DECLINED SLIGHTLY TO A TOTAL OF FOUR POINT SIX MILLION ANNUAL. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THIS IS TO IMPLEMENT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE ASSEMBLY APPROVE THE PROPOSAL WHILE THE SENATE REJECTED IT THIS IS ONE WHERE WE DO HAVE A COMPROMISE -- SPECIFICALLY THE COMPROMISE WOULD BE TO PROVIDE THE REQUESTED RESOURCES ON A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS. THIS WILL PROVIDE DOJ WITH THE RESOURCES TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE LAWS BUT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT DOJ COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DEMONSTRATE AFTER TWO YEARS. THAT THEY ARE -- IN THE END IN LINE WITH ACHIEVING SUFFICIENT PENALTY REVENUES TO SUPPORT THEIR COSTS WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION. FINANCE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL ALRIGHT. QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS MR OBERNOLTE. A QUESTION FOR THE OHIO. I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THE DELAYED DOJ GAVE US AS AN ESTIMATE WHEN. HE BE THREE SEVENTY FIVE ONE THREE APPROPRIATIONS LAST YEAR. DO YOU RECALL WHAT THAT NUMBER WAS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT WAS NEARLY THIS HIGH. AT SOMETHING WE MIGHT NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU FINE -- BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY TWO BILLS AND TOTAL IT WAS -- AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND ELEVEN ELEVEN TWENTY ONE AND SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BOTH OF THOSE IN COMBINATION AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT AMOUNT WAS. I WILL SAY THAT WHEN THIS REQUEST CAME FORWARD WE AND WE DID OUR ANALYSIS WE DID THINK THAT IT WAS REASONABLE -- ARE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH FEET WAS WITH FUND SOURCE AND SPECIFICALLY AND THAT WAS RELATED TO A LOT OF THE THE SPECIFIC. LAWS THAT WERE ENACTED SPECIFIED THAT THE PENALTY REVENUES WERE SUPPOSED TO COVER THE COSTS. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECTION [inaudible] ONE SO -- MR OBERNOLTE. ACCORDING TO THE APPROACH COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- FOR AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE PRICE TAG WAS SIX POINT SEVEN TWO MILLION I'M SORRY. FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR. TWO NE NINE THREE FOUR FIVE IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION. THAT WAS THAT RIGHT FIFTY SEVEN POSITIONS. MOST OF THE LOWER LEVEL. DID YOU HEAR ME YES OKAY GREAT. MADAM CHAIR IF I MIGHT ADD -- THEN ON SB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WHICH CAME AFTER I BELIEVE THE FISCAL I THINK WAS NEGLIGIBLE BECAUSE OF THAT OUR PURPOSE AND OFFICE. MOVING ON TO ISSUE TWELVE THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL AND THIRD PARTY WORKLOAD. AGAIN WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE [inaudible] HELLO. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A THIS IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE YOU DO HAVE A HANDOUT WILL BE JUST A GOING OVER THE FIRST PAGES THAT KIND OF SUMMARIZES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES. THE SECOND PAGES KEY FINDINGS FROM THE AUDITOR'S REPORT WHICH I'LL BE REFERENCING BRIEFLY IN MY COMMENTS. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDED FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ON A GOING FROM THE GAMBLING CONTROL FIND TO PERMANENTLY RETAIN A THIRTY TWO CARTER RELATED LICENSING POSITIONS OF THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL. THAT WERE DUE TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR -- IT ALSO INCLUDED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE AUTHORIZING THE FINANCE TO ADDRESS TO THE BUREAU GAMING FOR THE CONTROL RESOURCES BASED ON WORKLOAD CHANGES UPON THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION. TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. BOTH HOUSES APPROVED LIMITED TERM RESOURCES AND ADOPTED -- SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THIS WAS REALLY IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IT FOUND THAT DESPITE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WERE PROVIDED PRODUCTIVITY ACTUALLY DECLINED -- THERE ARE ALSO CONCERNS ABOUT -- INEFFICIENCIES AT THE BUREAU LEADING TO THE MAINTENANCE AND KIND OF GROWTH OF THE BACKLOG AS WELL AS DOJ -- IN ACCURATELY KIND OF BILLING THEIR TIME AND THEN CHARGING FOLKS FOR THE WORK THAT WAS DONE. SO IN LIGHT OF THIS BOTH HOUSES APPROVED -- THE REQUESTED RESOURCE IS ON A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS IN ORDER FOR THE BACKLOG TO BE CLEARED AND FOR SOME OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED. ON TOP OF THAT THE ADOPTED TWO SETS OF LANGUAGE THE FIRST WAS TO DIRECT -- THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL TO ESTABLISH A FORMAL PLAN BY NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN FOR COMPLETING REVIEW OF THE BACKLOG -- AND THEN THE SECOND WAS FOR THE BUREAU TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES BY JULY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FOR STAFF TO PROPERLY AND EQUITABLY REPORT THE TIME TO THAN ENSURE. THAT APPLICANTS WERE FAIRLY CHARGED -- THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF THE SENATE ALSO ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER BILL LANGUAGE IS GENERALLY -- IN RELATIONSHIP TO CARD ROOMS [inaudible] FINANCE. WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE DON'T HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROACH IN TERMS OF SOME THE ACTIONS THAT LA -- JUST DESCRIBED BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT HE CONTEMPLATED DEADLINES MAY BE UNREALISTIC SO THERE MAY BE SOME CHANGES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO BETTER ALIGN THOSE DEADLINES WITH WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND REGARDING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- RELATED TO CARD ROOMS THAT WERE AWAITING LANGUAGE FROM THE SENATE. ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON MR MCCARTY. FOR ME TO FINANCE COULD -- A PINE ON THE ON THE AUDIT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE POLICY ISSUES AND ANY. ANY -- DIRECTION GOING FORWARD FOR THE MINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT THIS. I THINK -- YOU KNOW THAT THE AUDIT ACTUALLY CAME OUT MAY SIXTEENTH SO IT WAS AFTER ME REVISION PROPOSAL I THINK IF WE WOULD OF VOTE COST CENTER PROBABLY WOULD HAVE IMPACTED OUR POSE A LITTLE BIT BUT IT DIDN'T AND SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE HAVEN'T. FULLY REVIEWED IT I THINK THAT WILL PROBABLY COME -- AS PART OF OUR FALL PROCESS OF REVIEWING WHAT THOUGHT IT SAID BUT AT THIS% POINT TIME WE HAVEN'T FULLY -- COME UP WITH ANY PROPOSAL FOR THAT [inaudible] MR TING. FOLLOW UP ON THE SAME QUESTION SO WHAT THE ASSEMBLY DID WAS. INCORPORATED AT LEAST THE SPECIFIC BUDGET PROVISIONS THAT THE AUDIT RECOMMENDED SO HOPEFULLY. THE MAYBE SOME OPENNESS UPON OUR FINANCES PART TO INCORPORATE THE SPECIFIC BUDGETARY RECOMMENDATIONS. WILL HOLD THE ITEM OPENED MOVING ON TO ITEM FOURTEEN THE AUDIT ON HATE CRIME. I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE IF ALONE I APOLOGIZE [inaudible] ISSUE. THIRTEEN THE FIRST MISTAKE I MADE ALL BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MISTER MOORE Là JUST RELAX OVER THERE. YOU WANT TO MAKE THEM YOU ARE AWESOME I APPRECIATE YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY ISSUE THIRTEEN IMPLEMENTATION OF PRICE GOUGING LEGISLATION. LA JOH [inaudible] THREE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FROM THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW OFTEN INTO POSITIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY DECLINING TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE COMPLAINTS OF PRICE GOUGING RELATED TO DECLARED STATES OF EMERGENCY. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL OF THE SENATE REJECTED IT. THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY WE WOULD NOTE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES -- WERE PROVIDED OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT DOJ WOULD USE THAT TO SUPPLEMENT THE WORK THAT LOCAL DJS WERE IT WOULD BE DOING IN THIS AREA. FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY ACTION ON THE SIDE OF A I HAVE A QUESTION AS WE LOOKED AT THE WAY OUT THE ENABLING LEGISLATION AB. NINETEEN NINETEEN ON MY INTERPRETATION IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT DOJ WAS NOT TASK WITH THE ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS BILL. THE BILL CREATES MISDEMEANORS HER FORCIBLE BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT -- AND SO ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT THERE WOULD BE A GOOD NUMBER OF EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DEALS YOU WOULD EVEN HAVE TO BE INVOLVED. THE ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO A COLLEAGUES TO GENERAL YOU -- AS YOU NOTED MADAM CHAIR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL PLAY A PRIMARY ROLE IN ADDRESSING THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOTICED WITH THESE EMERGENCY CASES THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY. THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY CONFINED TO JURISDICTIONAL LINES SO OFTEN THERE ACROSS COUNTIES ARE OTHER JURISDICTIONS SAID THE DOJ CAN PLAY A VERY HELPFUL COORDINATING ROLE ESPECIALLY IN A SITUATION OF STRESS WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH THIS. AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING EMERGENCY. AND SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE TO POSITIONS WOULD BE ADEQUATE STATE WHY. FOR THIS TYPE OF COORDINATING BUT IF YOU WANT TO ADD. I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT I THINK WHEN WE ARE REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL I'M IT DOES CONSIDER CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH THE LOCALS AND THEY WOULD STILL BE ENFORCING THESE LAWS AS WELL BUT IT IS MORE OF A A COORDINATION EFFORT ON BEHALF OF DOJ AND YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT. THEY'RE ABLE TO HANDLE ANY CROSS IT -- JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. MEMBERS FROM OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. FREE NONE WILL HOLD THE ANIMALS NOW ON TO ISSUE FOURTEEN AUDIT ON HATE CRIMES EL AL. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND FIVE POSITIONS IN -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THAT DECLINES TO SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE THOUSAND ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THIS IS TO AUDIT AND MONITOR THE COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF HATE CRIME DATA AS WELL AS IMPLEMENT OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS MADE. BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR IN A MAY REPORT MAY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT I BELIEVE. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVE THE PROPOSAL WHILE THE SENATE REJECTED IT. WE DO RECOMMEND THAT FAMILIES ACTION ON THIS ITEM AS IT WOULD PROVIDE DOJ WITH RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR. FINANCE. WE CONCUR WITH LA -- IN SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY ACTION. THE MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ORANGE COUNTY HAS A ROBUST -- UMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION I'M JUST WONDERING. THEY'RE THEY'RE PROVIDING GOOD ANGLE DATA ON HATE CRIMES. BUT I I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S PREVALENT EVERY OTHER OF THE FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES. I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE'RE READY KIND OF COVERING THIS JUST. BY PROGRAMS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. WHAT WILL FINANCE CAN RESPOND BUT BUT IT'S? MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THIS PARTICULAR ALLOCATION -- IS REALLY DEALING WITH -- DATA BASE HATE CRIME DATABASE. MANAGEMENT AN INJURY. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE KIND OF WORK ON THE TO THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. OR NOT IT IS AN ORANGE AND IT'S WHY I JUST GOT IT. OKAY FINANCES SKINNER WERE ROUTE ONCE RESPOND THE SKINNER. NOT ON THERE OKAY FINANCE. I'M NOT SURE I FULLY -- HAVE THE BACKGROUND ON WHAT YOU THE PROGRAM IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT THESE POSITIONS AT DOJ ARE TO HELP WITH -- THE LOCALS AND IN REPORTING HATE CRIMES IN THE INFORMATION TO DOJ AS WELL AS PROVIDING TRAINING TO LOCAL AGENCIES ON HOW TO IDENTIFY IT AND HOW TO RECORD IT -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE GETTING THIS ACCURATE INFORMATION I THINK IS WHAT THE AUDITOR FOUND IN THEIR REPORT SO. THESE POSITIONS WILL HELP DOJ -- WITHOUT CLICK THE INFORMATION. AND IF I MAY I MAY PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT TO SO SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE FINDINGS THAT WERE MADE -- THAT THIS WOULD ADDRESS IS THAT ONE OF THE FINDINGS WAS THAT SOMEONE FORSMAN AGENCIES WERE NOT ACCURATELY IDENTIFYING HATE CRIMES AND THEN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT TO ENTER THEM INTO THE SYSTEM. AND THAT THEY ALSO KIND OF LACKS THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS -- EXCITER AT ANOTHER FINDING THAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE POLICIES IN THIS AREA AND THAT DOJ KIND OF LACKED OVERSIGHT AND SO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS THAT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS -- AT LEAST TO THOSE TWO KEY FINDINGS ALONG WITH OTHERS. THANK YOU. BECAUSE THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION IS NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SO. IT YEAH IF IF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS AREN'T DOCUMENTING PROPERLY THEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR LETTING MASS YOUR MISTAKEN -- FOLLOWED BY THAT THE WEBER WITH SKINNER. YES THANK YOU -- OUR SUBCOMMITTEE WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS AND SOME OF US DID READ. THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. AND WHEN WE ASKED YEAR J. WHAT WAS THE BASICALLY THE AUDITOR'S REPORT -- POINTS OUT AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED HERE THAT. YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM THE LOCAL ENTITIES. BUT IS I THINK WE KNOWN WE'VE DISCUSSED WHETHER IT'S BROWN WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT APPS NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. CALIFORNIA'S HUGE STATE. THERE ARE A LOT OF AGENCIES SO WHAT WAS FRUSTRATING IN THE PROCESS OF HEARING THIS WAS DEAR [inaudible] DID YOU. THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT HOW WOULD ADDING FIVE MORE F. T. E.. INSURER THAT WE IN FACT HAD ALL THE HATE CRIMES REPORTED. AND THE AUDITOR'S REPORT ALSO POINTED OUT THAT. INTO THEM AND THIS IS THEIR ASSESSMENT DATA THE I. D. O. J.'S -- IN WAS INEFFECTIVE AT DIRECTING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO UTILIZE THE DATABASE SO AGAIN. GIVEN THE INFORMATION IN THE AUTHORED REPORT IT WASN'T CLEAR HOW OFFERING FIVE WORK FUNDING FIVE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WOULD NECESSARILY ACCOMPLISH. WHAT WAS TRYING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED? SO -- THAT IT WAS THE RECENT THE SENATE REJECTED THANK YOU. YEAH I WILLIAM NO I'M. I'M VERY PROBABLY SENSITIVE TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE GET INVOLVED IN LOOKING AT THE GANG LIST THAT EXISTED IN STATE. AND AND WHEN I DID THAT I'D SOME POINT EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I ASKED -- WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT HATE CRIMES YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE WE'VE HAD? A GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO WOULD YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A GANG IF THEY HAD BEEN A DIFFERENT RACE. ACTUALLY ATTACK AND KILLED A YOUNG MAN IN SAN DIEGO. AND THEY DID ONE IS LISTED AS A HATE CRIME THEY DID IT BECAUSE OF WHO HE WAS HE WAS A HAWAIIAN KID IN A GOUP OF THEM. REFER SKINHEADS BASICALLY FOLLOWED HIM HOME AND CHILDREN OKAY -- THAT WAS NEVER LISTED AS A HATE CRIME AND NOR WOULD THEY EVER SEEN AS A GANG. SO I'VE ASKED THEM OFTEN DO YOU I KNOW YOU CHRONICLE LIST AND ACTIVITIES FOR BLACK AND BROWN KIDS WHO ARE CALLED GANG MEMBERS OKAY AND AND THAT'S A BIG THING STATEWIDE. DO YOU DO THE SAME THING FOR WHITE KIDS WHO MAY BE A PART OF A GANG A SKINHEAD GANG THAT BASICALLY. GET ENGAGES INSTANCE SOMETIMES EVEN WORSE ACTIVITIES IN TERMS OF UP ON INDIVIDUALS BASED ON THEIR RACE OR WHATEVER AND THEY DON'T -- SO THERE'S A PROBLEM IN GETTING THAT DATA. BECAUSE THE DATA WITHIN INFORM US OF THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM WHERE IT'S LOCATED -- IT GOES ACROSS COUNTY LINES AND DID VARIOUS PLACES -- AND AND THEN WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE INTERVENE HOW DO WE HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT RECOGNIZE IT AND IDENTIFIED IN RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T REALLY DO A LOT OF THAT. AND SO -- YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THIS AND SAID OKAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT LIKE MOST PROBLEMS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT UNLESS YOU KNOW THE SIZE OF IT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S LOCATED IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT INTERVENTION AND THINGS THAT SCHOOLS IF YOU DON'T EVER SEE IT AS A PROBLEM. AND SOME COUNTIES DON'T EVER SEE IT AS A PROBLEM. YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE MAKE UP OF THE COUNTY OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE AN ACTIVITIES A CAR. AND THEY DON'T THINK THIS IS LIKE HORSE OF KIDS PLAN AROUND WHATEVER BABY AND YET IT REALLY RISES THE ACTIVITIES AND THE THE HARM THAT SUN RISES TO THE LEVEL. OF A GANG ACTIVITY A MOB KIND OF SITUATION OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE BUT WE NEED TO GET TO THE POINT WE START LOOKING AT THESE THINGS. BECAUSE THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WE'RE FINDING THAT -- THEY HAVE SOMEHOW INFILTRATED MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE MAN WITH A MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN THE WORST KIND OF SITUATION AND WE SEE IT. BUT ON THE ON GOING BASIS THE LITTLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO WRITE THEM OFTEN SO -- THIS IS THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT IT'S OF NO MORE THAN JUST A COLLECTION OF DATA AND TELLING PEOPLE WHERE IDEAS AND HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND IT ALL WHEN THINGS BREAK OUT AND YOU HAVE A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR. AND CERTAIN PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE SAME BEHAVIOR OF FROM YOU KNOW THEN YOU GET A SENSE OF SOMETHING THAT'S GROWING THAT SIGNIFICANT THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESSCELL -- THAT WAS MY TAKE ON THIS IN TERMS OF THE THE THE HATE CRIMES IN TRYING TO GET THE DATA. FOR ALL ANY INFORMATION BECAUSE THESE THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN AND ALL THE SAID THEY JUST. YOU KNOW USE YOU SEE IT AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW IT HAPPENED OFTENTIMES THE THINGS IN THIS THEIR THEIR SIGNS AN INDICATION THAT THINGS ARE OCCURRING. THAT WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO IGNORE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A CUSTOM -- TO WATCHING OKAY. WILL HOLD THE PHANTOM OPEN ISSUE FIFTEEN DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE RE ORGANIZATION. I THINK SO. HELLO PLEASE PROCEED -- TOMORROW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT'S PART OF ITS BUDGET PLAN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED REMOVING THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND MAKING IT A SEPARATE DEPARTMENT OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THE NEW APARTMENT WOULD BE CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. THE SENATE APPROVED PLACE ON A TRAILER BILL THAT WOULD SHIFT ALL JUVENILE JUSTICE GRAMS TO THE NEWLY CREATED DEPARTMENT OF USING COMMITTEE RESTORATION BY JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND SHIFT THE NAME CHANGE FROM THE JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO JANUARY -- TWENTY TWENTY THEY ALSO APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS PROPOSED. ON THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED A PROPOSED AND ADOPTED PLACE OLD TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE HAVE CREATED AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND ALSO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS REGARDING THE COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF DATA. RELATED TO THE SAFETY IN CARE OF YOUTH. THE CONFERENCE ISSUES ARE THE CONTENTS OF THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS PROPOSED BY EACH HOUSE. WE RECOMMEND A COMPROMISE TO PUT THE TOTAL BILL LANGUAGE ADOPTED BY BOTH HOUSES. AS THE LANGUAGE APPROVED BY EACH HOUSE WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THE ISSUE [inaudible] FIFTEEN SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM CHAIR I THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT. SUBSTANTIAL AND FAR REACHING APPROACH. A REDIRECTION OF THE ENTIRE. HISTORY OF JUVENILE JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S NOT MERIT IN THIS CHANGE. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY LOOSE ENDS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY IS VERY THOROUGHLY THOUGHT OUT. AND PRETTY PLAN. AS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TREMENDOUS CHANGE. AND AND THE STAKES ARE HIGH HERE. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THIS WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR TRAILER BILL. AND AND I AND I ARGUE THAT BULLSHIT PERSONALLY THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BE LET DOWN. IS THIS JUST STEPS ON WAY. THROUGH AS A TRAILER BILL IT IS A MAJOR CHANGE. IT CAN HAVE HOPE IT CAN A PROMISE. BUT DON'T INFO OVER INFLATE THE PROMISE. THEN IGNORE SOME OF THE DOWNSIDE SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU -- OUR SUBCOMMITTEE WAS. SUPPORTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S MOVED. TO HAVE -- DJJ HOUSED WITH THE pHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE NAME CHANGE. AND WE UNDERSTOOD IT IN THE IN IN OUR DISCUSSION IN THE HEARING AS SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. WAS THAT PART OF ITS PURPOSE WAS SAY KIND OF RE ORIENTATION AND A CULTURE CHANGE TO HOW WE DEAL WITH ARE JUVENILES THAT ARE IN. THAT -- ARE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF MANY OF THE BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. WHILE NONE OF THE BILL'S EXPLICITLY HAD THIS COMPONENT CERTAINLY ARE. IN THE ORIENTATION OR IN THE DIRECTION OF TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THAT. THE RESEARCH ON BRAIN DEVELOPMENT SHOWS THAT OUR TIME JUVENILE STORY VERY UNIQUE POPULATION MORE UNIQUE THAN HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY -- CONSIDERED ARE FACTORED AND REALLY DO NEED TO BE TREATED VERY DIFFERENTLY. AND THAT HAVE M. THE POTENTIAL. FOR TO REHABILITATION BECAUSE OF THEIR THEIR IT NOT ONLY THEIR AGE BUT ALSO THIS LEVEL OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THAT WITH THE RIGHT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS. WE COULD CONCEIVABLY HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WINTER REALLY DO ASSIST TURNING THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES AROUND. AND SO WITH WITH THAT IN MIND THE ARE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. TO BOTH -- MOVE THE DIVISION INTO THIS NEW INTO ITS IN TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND TO DO THE NAME CHANGE BUT WE FELT THAT. WE WE WANTED TO ENSURE AND NOT TO SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENT IS ONLY COSMETIC. BUT WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE RESOURCES TO HELP WITH THAT CULTURE CHANGE WHICH IS WHY WE INCLUDED IN OUR PACKAGE SOME FUNDING. TO BEGIN -- TO DO THIS THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES MODEL WHICH HAS BEEN -- IS BEING APPLIED IN A NUMBER OF OUR STATE PRISONS WITH A VARIETY OF AGES BUT FOR WHICH THE RESEARCH SHOWS HAS MORE PROMISE EVEN. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE SO THAT WAS ONE OF OUR THAT WAS OUR INTENT IN ADDING THAT COMPONENT. NO I'M NOT SURE IF THE ISSUE AROUND THE AN ADVISORY BOARD. WAS REALLY BROUGHT BEFORE US WHEN WE HER DECIDE I'M I THINK WE HEARD THE ITEM BEFORE. THE ASSEMBLY SUBCOMMITTEE DID BUT IN HEARING WHAT THE LA -- JUST RECOMMENDED WHICH WOULD BE KIND OF A HYBRID -- COMPROMISE BEING BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE SECTION. AT LEAST -- FOR FOR MY OWN SELF AND I SPEAK NOW JUSTICE -- ONLY ONE SENATOR AND THAT SUBCOMMITTEE I WOULD BE VERY OPEN. TO INCORPORATING THE ASSEMBLIES ADVISORY -- BOARD SUGGESTION IN THAT ACTION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FACT WEBER IT IS -- MA'AM CHAIR AND WE TO LOOK AT THIS PROPOSAL AND HAD QUITE A FEW INDIVIDUALS TO CALM AND TO TESTIFY CONCERNING. THE PROPOSAL ITSELF YOU KNOW HAVING -- DONE SOME WORK AS WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE JUNE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HOW DO WE MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF BUILDING IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND AND MAKE IT NOT JUST A PIPELINE TO A BIGGER PRISON LATER ON WE WERE. COULDN'T WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THIS BOOK THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE -- TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY OUR COMMITTEE AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE WE REQUESTED QUITE OFTEN A LOT OF INFORMATION AND WE DIDN'T GET NECESSARY LOT OF DETAILS FROM. OF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OTHERS WHO MAKING THE PROPOSAL SO THE PROPOSAL DIDN'T COME TO US WITH A LOT OF DETAILS A LOT OF INFORMATION. OF THAT WAS THERE THAT WAS THAT WAS PROBLEMATIC FOR ME BECAUSE I'M A DETAIL PERSON ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU START TALKING WITH CHANGING PROGRAMS AND ADJUSTING BECAUSEI KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO CHANGE I'M ANOTHER THING TO CHANGE IN A WAY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. AND OUR THINKING WAS -- WITH THIS WITH REGARD TO THIS AS THE AS WE HAD ALL OF THE FOLKS TALKING AND COME IN MANY OF THE ADVOCATES WERE VERY. MUCH IN FAVOR THOSE WHO WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IN BJJ -- WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CHANGE THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY WOULD THAT WE NEED TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME DIFFERENT THINGS AND REDUCING THE POPULATION BUT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WAS DIFFERENT TO DEAL WITH YOUNG PEOPLE -- AND FOR THAT REASON -- WE WANTED MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE WE ALSO DIDN'T WANT TO NOT THAT THIS WAS WHAT THE THE PROPOSAL WAS BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO JUST TAKE IT. FROM. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENT AND THAT WOULD BE IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK JUST MOVING A PROGRAM FROM ONE HOUSE TO THE NEXT HOUSE WOULD MAKE EIGHTY SIX ANY SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE IN CHANGE. AND I WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE OR HAVE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE FELT THAT. IN THIS MOVE THAT GO THAT'S TO POST THAT'S TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS MOVIE THERE'S SOME THERE'S A NEED FOR SOME -- SOME ANALYSIS AND SOME INPUT AND SOME SUGGESTIONS OF OF HOW THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE THAT IS NOT JUST A MOVEMENT BUT IT REALLY IS. A TRYING TO INCORPORATE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT FOLKS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THOSE WHO ADVOCATES OUT THERE AND AND MANY OF THEM WERE SKEPTICAL ONE OF THE CHANGE WHAT WAS SKEPTICAL THAT WAY THERE THAT WAS JUST GOING TO BE. A MOVING FROM ONE HOUSE TO THE NEXT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WOULD BE THE SAME. THAT THE SAME ACTIVITIES WOULD BE THE SAME AND OUTCOMES BE THE SAME BUT MAYBE UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES. SO I THINKING WAS THAT TO HAPPEN ADVISORY COMMITTEE NOT ONLY MADE UP THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALL OF THAT BUT SOME OF THE ADVOCATES IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE SPENT YEARS WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. AND SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN AND AND IN THE SYSTEM THEMSELVES -- WHO CAME TO US AND TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THEY WERE DOING AND HOW WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE CERTAIN KINDS OF THINGS IN PLACE TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE TO GROW AND DEVELOP AND? AND WHY THEY WERE IN THE SYSTEM AND WHAT AND HOW TO PREVENT IT IN THE FUTURE SO. WE THOUGHT AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WOULD BE IN A WOULD BE IMPORTANT IN STRUCTURING THE PROGRAMS THAT AND AND STRUCTURE A WHAT WOULD TAKE PLACE. OF THAT IT WOULD NOT BE JUST A QUICK THING THAT WE WOULD DO IT TO BE OVER AND WE'VE DONE IT AND WE SHIFTED FROM ONE PLACE THE OTHER NOW LOOKS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS NEW PAINT. AND FACILITIES BUT BASICALLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE INTERNAL IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PROGRAM WOULD LOOK LIKE WITH THE OUTCOMES WOULD BE HOW THE YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD BE MENTORED AND SUPPORTED IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY THAN THEY WERE RIGHT DANCE SO. FOR THAT REASON WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW DOING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE THE SENATE TALKED ABOUT WOULD BE GOOD BUT WE BUT WE ALWAYS FELT THAT THERE HAD TO BE. SOME OTHER MINDS AND BRAINS IN THIS ROOM TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND TO BEGIN TO FASHION A PROGRAM -- PRETTY MUCH LIKE MISTER NIELSEN WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT EVENT. THAT WOULD DOING AND WE SHOULD MAKE IT COUNT IT SHOULD MEAN SOMETHING IN THE AND AND THAT IT'S REALLY REALLY BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF INSTITUTION. AND MANY OF US TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN -- THAT I'VE SEEN AS I'VE TRAVELED WORLD AND SEE. THE GOD AND ONTO THEIR WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE JUVENILE HALL AND SEE TOTALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF PHILOSOPHY OF HOW THEY HANDLE YOUNG PEOPLE AND HOW THEY REBUILD THEM WITH FAMILIES BECAUSE THERE'S SOME XIN IS. WHEN KIDS ARE IN TROUBLE IS BECAUSE THIS PROBLEMS IN THE FAMILY SO YOU GOT A BILL THE FAMILY IF YOU'RE GOING TO HELP THE KIDS MOVE BACK INTO THE FAMILY? AND SO I THINK THAT A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THAT THAT IS THE YEAR THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT WE CAN INCORPORATE THESE THIS INSTITUTION. TAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY WE SPEND OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHILD. IN THIS IN THIS SET OUT IN TO XIN AND WE SHOULD BE AT THAT POINT -- GETTING GREATER OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF YOUNG PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR IN A BETTER POSITION AND AND MOVING TO BECOME REALLY CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS TO THE SOCIETY SO. THAT'S WHY WE RECOMMEND AT THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE -- BECAUSE WE DIDN'T SEE IT AS A QUICK MOVE A QUICK FIX THAT THIS WAS AN ONGOING PROCESS THAT WE WOULD. AT AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY DISCOVERED AND WHAT THEY FOUND AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO WE COULD COST SO WE COULD BE INVOLVED IN SHAPING INFORMING. THIS NEW ENTITY -- THAT HAD MOVED FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER BECAUSE WE NOT ONLY ONE OF THE OPTICS TO BE CORRECT AND AND AND THE PEOPLE WHO RUN IT WITH THE ATTITUDE TO BE CORRECT -- BUT WE ALSO WANT THE PROGRAM TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT AND THE OUTCOME SO SO THAT'S WHY WE RECOMMEND IT AND ADVISORY COMMITTEE -- WE WERE WE DIDN'T GET WHAT WE WANT. BUT WE GET FROM THE MINISTRATION TERMS OF A PLAN LAID OUT. BUT WE KNEW PLENTY TO BE LAID OUT RIGHT AND WITHOUT ADVISORY COMMITTEE WOULD HELP ACCOMPLISH THAT THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ARE WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN ISSUE SIXTEEN DJJ APPRENTICESHIP POLLOCK WITH CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS [inaudible] BELIAU. WITH WITH THIS VIDEO PROPOSAL FOR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION IN GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY GOING DOWN TO NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ON GOING. ON TO ESTABLISH A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN DJJ DRUG DIVISION OF JUNE JUSTICE AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS -- THE REQUESTED RESOURCE IS WOULD IMPLEMENT ED UP FRIENDSHIP CONSERVATION CORPS PILOT PROGRAM WITH THE GOAL TO PROVIDE DJ YOUTH WITH A SKILL BUILDING AND JOB READINESS OPPORTUNITIES. AND RIDE PATHWAYS TO CONSERVATION COURIERS. THE SENATE APPROVED THE FUNDING AND POSITIONS BUT CAPPED AT FIVE YEARS. AND THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED AS BUDGET. THE COMPETITION IS ON THE LINE TO THE FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSED RESOURCES. WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE SENATE'S AUCTION BECAUSE THIS WAS OPPOSE AS A PILOT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO LIMIT THE FUNDING. TO A PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT THAT PROGRAM CAN BE EVALUATED BEFORE IMPLEMENTING ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY ACTION AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR PROPOSAL ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MAY REVISION USES THE WORD PINE AWAY -- BUT THE WAY THAT WE WERE THINKING OF THAT WORD WAS THAT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF RESTORATIVE PROGRAMMING THAT WERE ENVISIONING FOR THIS NEW -- DEPARTMENT AND WE DID NOT ENVISION AND DO NOT ENVISION THIS PROPOSAL WAS LIMITED TERMINATE ME WAY. ALL RIGHT COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. THREE NINE THIS ITEM WILL BE LEFT OPEN. MOVING ON TO ISSUE. SEVENTEEN UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AT ALL CDC OUR FACILITIES ELIA. BUT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ESTABLISH AN ONGOING INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM APOLOGIES THAT SHOULD BE A HAND OUT IN FRONT OF THE ON THE DEATH WE HAVE IT -- SO THIS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AT ALL TH. VOTER BE IMPLEMENT ALL THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES AND THE PROGRAMS CALLED WOULD BE TO TREAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS A CHRONIC ILLNESS REDUCE FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND IMPROVE. THE REHABILITATIVE ENVIRONMENT IN PRISONS IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE CHANGES TO REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS INCLUDING ALL COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY PROGRAMS AND ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR OF YOUR USES OLD ON ALCOHOL USE DISORDER OR SENATE. APPROVED THE BOOK OUT PROPOSAL HAS BUDGETED AND ASSEMBLY ADOPTED A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A THROUGH YOUR PILOT OF THE PROGRAM AT THAT THREE FACILITIES WITH EXISTING. MEDICATIONS AS A TREATMENT PILOTS AND FOR DIGITAL FACILITIES WITH THE HIGHEST -- WOULD OVER STRAITS FOR TOTAL OF SEVEN FACILITIES -- BY THE DO NOT AN ONGOING PROGRAM AT ALL OF PRESENCE AS APPROVED BY THE SENATE -- THIS WOULD PROVIDE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT OF A THREE YEAR PERIOD WITH SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION AND TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO INCLUDES A DRUG INTERDICTION PROGRAM AT ONE OF THE SEVEN FACILITIES. AND ALLOWS ADMINISTRATION TO AUGMENT THE AMOUNT PROVIDED BY UP 220% WITH PRIOR NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. IT ALSO REQUIRES REPORTS ON THE PROGRAM'S IMPLEMENTATION AND AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION. THE CONFERENCE ISSUES ARE THE CONTENTS OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THIS FAMILIES BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR THE PILOT. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO APPROVED -- ASSEMBLY PLAN -- THIS WOULD ALLOW THE LEDGE CESSATION OF THE ABILITY TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM AND A TIME AND WHETHER IT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE AND HOW IT SHOULD BE EMPLOYMENT STATEWIDE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT THE PROGRAM IS IT UNTESTED AND ACROSS EXTENSIVE COORDINATION WITH -- COMMUNITY PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE DEPARTMENTS CONTROL. WE NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY FORMAL REPORTING ON IN FROM THE GOVERNOR FOES NOT INCLUDE ANY FORMAL REPORTING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION ALL THE THICKNESS OF THIS PROGRAM. IN ADDITION THE ASSEMBLY PLAN WOULD ALLOW THAT -- DEPARTMENT TO COLLECT DATA TO BETTER FROM THE COSTS OF AND RESOURCE NECESSARY TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO OTHER FACILITIES -- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THE THE INSTRUCTOR NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE STATEWIDE THAT HAS NOT BEEN CLEANED THE PROPOSAL FOR INSTANCE -- AND THAT ESTIMATED DEMAND FOR TREATMENT IS ON SORT IN ITS CALMLY BASED OFF OF ESTIMATES ARE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTIVE OF CDC OURS POPULATION. TELL PASSAGE WE RECOMMEND GOING TO THE ASSEMBLY ACTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CLINT. TACKLING COME APARTMENT -- FINANCE THAT WE SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION ON THIS PROPOSAL -- INMATES HAVE -- THERE'S A WIDESPREAD NEED FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT THROUGHOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM LIMITING IT TO ONLY SEVEN PRISONS WALL THERE'S OPIOID. DEATHS ON THE INCREASE AS WELL AS HOPPED HOSPITALIZATION SEEMS TO LIMIT CARE IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T THINK IS RESPONSIVE TO THE ISSUE. AND SO THEREFORE WE REQUEST -- THE FULL FUNDING OF OUR PROPOSAL. THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL THAT ARE DEFINITELY NEW AND UNIQUE TO A KERN CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM BUT MOST OF THESE COMPONENTS ARE EVIDENCE BASED FAIRS ASSESSMENTS. AND THERE'S TREATMENT AND THERE'S FOLLOW UP AND THERE'S MOVING THROUGH LEVELS OF CARE AND ALL THOSE THINGS GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE EVIDENCE BASED. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED AND IN THIS EXACT SETTING BUT THERE MOST OF THESE PIECES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN REVIEWED AS APPROPRIATE AND IN THE WAY OF ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM. QUESTION FOR MEMBERS TO NIELSEN. WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT. THE DRUGS THAT ARE NOW IN [inaudible] THE PRISON. THE CITY SHE ARE. HAVE ANY NEW IDEAS ABOUT. INTERCEPTING THE INCOMING DRUGS. FOR EXAMPLE SOME COME IN THROUGH THE FIRE CAMPS. THAT'S NOT THE BIGGEST PLACES. I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT WOULD GETS INTO THE INSTITUTION. YEAH I SO I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS OVER THE LAST EW YEARS ABOUT INTERDICTION EFFORTS I THINK LAST YEAR FUNDED A PILOT AT ONE INSTITUTION TO DO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SORT OF SCREENING -- TO INTERDICT DRUGS THERE'S BEEN PREVIOUS PROPOSALS I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HEARD RELATED TO THE USE OF NINES FOR INTERDICTION -- I THINK THE THE KEY COMPONENT HERE IS THAT THERE'S EVEN ON THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE INTERDICTION EFFORTS THERE'S STILL SORT OF SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT THAT'S DONE IN A NEW WAY ABSOLUTELY I WOULD NOT IN. STATE YOU'D EVER GOING TO STOP ENOUGH GETTING IN. NO OF TREATMENT IS IS ESSENTIAL. BUT A TREATMENT ALSO NEEDS TO FOLLOW THE INMATE. BACK OUT INTO SOCIETY AS WELL. THAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT. AND AT OUR PROPOSAL DOES HAVE -- NURSING STAFF THAT ARE GOING TO WORK -- TO TENER STYLISH COMMUNITY PLACEMENTS. I MAKING SURE THAT. WHERE -- THAT THEY CAN ACCESS TO CONTINUE TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS. FRIEDMAN WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAM CALVET FUNDING. PAGE TWENTY OF THE AGENDA. WE'VE GOT A LA JOH -- PAPER LA -- WHEN YOU'RE READY AND CHAIR? CALVET BUSY CAM COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS THAT PROVIDES FUNDING. TO CITIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE PREVENTION WORK. IT'S BEEN FUNDED OUT AROUND NINE MILLION ONE TIME FOR YOU TO THE PAST TWO FISCAL YEARS YOUR HAND OUT PROVIDES A BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THE PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND I'M GOING. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED IS BUDGETED. THE SENATE WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND NINE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND GOING. TO THE CONFERENCE ISSUE BEFORE YOU TODAY IS. THE SENATE ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION ONE TIME IN THE BUDGET YEAR. WE THINK THIS IS A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY WE WERE JUST NOTE THAT THE BCC IS SIX AS EXPECTED TO SUBMIT A REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRST ROUND OF GRANTS IN MARCH -- TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS REPORT COULD INFORM PEAK AT FUNDING DECISIONS. THANK YOU FINANCE. TWENTY ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. DO YOU HAVE ANY -- INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS. OKAY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS -- THE HOWEVER THE THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT ESTABLISHES THE CAL THAT PROGRAM DOES REQUIRE THE BOARD OF STATE IN COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. TO PRIORITIZE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE VIOLENCE WHEN IMPLEMENTED ELSEWHERE -- THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ACTUALLY BEING FUNDED -- ARE DOING THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHETHER THE THIS IS EFFECTIVE IN ACTUALLY SELECTING ULTIMATELY AT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BASED ON EVIDENCE BASED -- PROGRAMS AND WHETHER THOSE ARE IMPLEMENTED WITH FIDELITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- IN ADDITION I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM THE FIRST ROUND OF CALVET THAT CAL BIT -- GRANTEES ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THEIR FUNDING THEIR FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING. SO THEY HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. SKINNER THANK YOU. I'M ACTUALLY THE LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDED FUNDING TO AND SOME COMMUNITIES FOR GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION EVEN PRIOR TO THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEAR. AND I THINK ALEJO'S POINT ABOUT. WILL WAS STEPPING BACK THERE IS A GOOD AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT -- DOCUMENTS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEORIES VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. NOW I THINK THE ALEJO'S POINT WHETHER THE ONES THAT GOT FUNDED HAVE FOLLOWED THE TYPE OF AREA. THAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS REALLY WORKS. YOU KNOW I CAN'T SAY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT WHAT -- WHAT THE RECENT -- ENTITIES THAT WERE FUNDED IN THE MOST RECENT ROUNDS FOR BE A CC BUT CERTAINLY WHAT I IF THE REPORT SHOWS THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE CRITERIA. THAT WOULD BE -- GREAT -- BUT I THINK WE WOULDN'T WANT IF IT CHOSE PERHAPS. SOME ISSUES AROUND AFFECTED MISS. IT WOULDN'T BE A MATTER OF THAT VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS ARE AN EFFECTIVE IT MIGHT BE A MATTER OF THE CRITERIA WE ARE USING BECAUSE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF BODY OF RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IT. AND IN FACT THERE'S EVEN DOCUMENTATION ON LOWERED GUN VIOLENCE RATES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN RESEARCHED -- IN OAKLAND IS ONE OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE SO -- JUST BAD DATA BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE THERE IS GOOD RESEARCH SHOWING THAT APPROPRIATELY USE THESE VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE WILL PULL THE ITEM OPEN. MOVING ON THE FINAL ISSUE OF THE EVENING ISSUE NINETEEN IN CARS PEACE OFFICER TRAINING. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A OHIO -- PAPER ON THIS IS WELL LA -- WHEN YOU'RE READY? GREAT THE GOVERNOR'S UP THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN PROVIDES THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION ON AN ONGOING BASIS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TO POST THIS IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT -- AUGMENTATION ON AN ONGOING BASIS FOR POST. POST PLANS TO USE IT IN A VERY PARTICULAR WAYS WHICH IS LAID OUT ON PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT AND THAT PROVIDES -- A BREAK OUT OF IT BUT SPECIFICALLY IT'S TO RESTORE CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND% SERVICES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ELIMINATED DUE TO REDUCTIONS INCOME ALL FINE AND FEE REVENUES -- NEW PROGRAMS IN CERTAIN AREAS AND THEN EXPANSIONS AND OTHERS. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED -- THIS FUNDING ON A ONE TIME BASIS -- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND THE MONEY IS GENERALLY CONTENTION ON THE ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION CHANGING THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAN USE DEADLY FORC. THE FUDS WOULD GENERALLY BE USED TO HELP TRAIN THE OFFICERS ON THAT NEW STANDARD -- AND WE WOULD KNOW THAT THREE MILLION OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT WOULD BE ONGOING IN NATURE FOR POST KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. ADDITIONALLY THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING ANNUAL REPORTING. AND THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FUNDING PROVIDED AS WELL AS HAVING -- ONE THE AGENCIES AND EXCUSE ME AS WELL AS HAVING POST REPORT ON KEY METRICS RELATED TO FOR EXAMPLE TO THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS TRAINS AND THE COST -- PER OFFICER TRAINED. AND SO THE ISSUES AND CONFERENCE ARE WHETHER THE FUNDING IS ONE TIME OR ONGOING -- WHETHER THEIR CONDITIONS ON THE FUNDING AND THEN FINALLY -- ON THE LANGUAGE THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. ON THIS PACKAGE ESSENTIALLY WE DO THINK IT'S AN ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MONEY TO PROVIDE WHETHER IT'S ONE TIME OR ONGOING. AS WELL AS HOW MUCH DISCRETION TO PROVIDE TO POST -- WE DO HAVE TO COMMONSENSE RELATED TO WHATEVER PACKAGE THE LEGISLATURE DOES CHOOSE TO ADOPT THE FIRST IS AND WHATEVER PACKAGE THAT'S ADOPTED WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENSURE. THAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND PRIORITIES RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE ASSEMBLY IS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ON REPORTING THAT WOULD DEFINITELY PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH MORE INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT. THE FUNDING HAD UPON TRAINING AND THAT WOULD HELP INFORM LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE ABOUT WHERE TO PUT RESOURCES AND HOW MUCH IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS ARE INTERESTED IN [inaudible] FINANCE PLEASE. WE SUPPORT THE SENATE ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL AND I'LL MAKE TWO BRIEF POINTS THE FIRST IS THAT. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE NATURE OF THE FUNDING GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE THE ADMINISTRATION PLACES ON THIS PROGRAM AND THE ISSUE THAT IT'S INTENDED TO ADDRESS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS FUNDING SHOULD BE ON GOING AND THEN THE SECOND POINT IS WITH REGARD -- TO WHERE THIS FUNDING IS GOING -- FOURTEEN POINT NINE MILLION IS TO RESTORE OPPOSED TO ITS HISTORICAL LEVEL OF FUNDING WHEN IT COMES TO THE REMAINING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO WAYS OF DIRECTING THAT FUNDING -- SPECIFICALLY -- AIMING THESE RICH RESOURCES AT DE ESCALATION PROGRAMS WHICH WE KNOW IS A CONCERN UT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU EVER YES I'D OUT MY LOSING TO THE COMPROMISE AND AND I THINK THERE COULD WITH WHERE WE'RE AT VARIOUS PLACES BUT I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY THE SAME CONVERSATION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- WE DID AND AND COMMITTEE AND WE WERE LISTENING TO LA LA -- IS THAT YOU KNOW UNLESS WE IDENTIFIED -- AT SOME POINT WE KNOW THERE'S A NEED FOR SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY THIS ON GOING BECAUSE OF THE SUFFERING WHAT WHAT THEY'VE HAD IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF REDUCTION SO YOU WANT TO STABILIZE ADMINISTRATION OF IT. BUT IF WE'RE TALKING YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO WITH THE MONEY. ESPECIALLY IF IF IF WE CREATE POLICY OF THAT THAT DEMANDS A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF TRAINING WE HAVE TO FUND THAT TRAINING AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE COMMITTED TO DO. THE FUN TRAINING SO THAT WE COULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OF DEADLY FORCE EFFORTS AND THINGS BEING USED OF IN THE GOVERNOR AGREES WITH THAT. SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THAT AND AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE LAST YEAR WE GAVE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET -- AND FIVE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR SPECIAL GRANTS OF THE OTHER TWENTY WAS SUPPOSED TO BEGIN AND HOPEFULLY THE TRAINING AND DE ESCALATION AND IT WASN'T DONE IT WAS IN USE FOR THAT. AND SO AND WITHOUT SOME LANGUAGES SAYS THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECT -- AND WE FIND IT TO BE TRUE IN A WHOLE LOT OF PROGRAMS IS NOT JUST THIS -- ONE BUT WE'RE BEING TOLD ALL CONSTANTLY THAT IF YOU IF YOU GIVE MONEY YOU DON'T DIRECT FOR YOU THINK IT'LL GO WITH IT'S AN EDUCATION WERE EVER. ANY GOALS FOR WHATEVER PEOPLE FEEL IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THAT MOMENT AND THEN AS A LEGISLATURE WILL UPSET BECAUSE IT WOULD COME BACK AND LOOK AND SEE THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED. BOB WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF FUNDING THEY'LL BE A LOT MORE FUNDING NEEDED TO TO REALLY CHANGE THE CULTURAL POLICING IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT WOULD IF WE'RE GOING TO START IT WE HAVE TO START WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MONEY'S GOING IN THAT DIRECTION WHETHER ITS ONGOING COST OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE THE IDEA OF REPORTING BACK IN TERMS OF TELLING US. WHAT YOU DID WITH THE MONEY SETTING OUT SOME GOALS AND OBJECTIVES VERTICALLY MARY OF TRAINING SO THAT THE CURRICULUM BEING DEVELOPED IS BEING DEVELOPED IN IT WHAT THE PARTICULAR GOAL IN MIND? OTHERWISE WE WOULD JUST TRAINING FOLKS WE HAVE NO WAY OF DETERMINING WHETHER NOT WE'RE GOING TO COMP WAS THE GOALS THAT WE SET BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. SAYING THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN -- WE DO THAT IN MANY AREAS OR THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WHEN WE CHANGED OUR CURRICULUM PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE GAVE UP ABOUT HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BILLION DOLLARS WHATEVER IT WAS. TO BASICALLY TRAIN THEM ON THE NEW CURRICULA WHY BECAUSE WE WANT THE CURRICULUM TO BE IMPLEMENTED WITH ONE SOME SENSE OF THE DELI WE JUST GAVE A MONIES THEY HAVE STAFF DEVELOPMENT WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS EVERYTHING HAPPENS. OTHER THAN WHAT WE WANT TO HAPPEN AND SO I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS A COLLABORATIVE IN TERMS OF PULLING THE THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS TOGETHER. THAT WE KNOW THAT SOMEONE WILL THERE'S SOME FUNNY THE NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO BASICALLY STABILIZE THE STRUCTURE GIVE THEM THE THINGS THEY NEED WHAT IT'S FORTY MILLION WHATEVER IT IS. BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT TRAINING DOLLARS WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THE TRAINING THAT WE HAVE SET FORTH THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO MOVE US TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF CULTURAL POLICING. IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT AND IN FACT IN ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY MADE VERY CLEAR IF WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THIS WE HAVE TO HAVE RESOURCES TO DO IT. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE TRAINING TO ACCOMPLISH IT AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT AND THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR WE GIVEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO BEGIN THE PROCESS THAT DIDN'T GET. TO GET STARTED SO THIS TWENTY MILLION WILL BE ON TOP OF THE OTHER TWENTY THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE ACCESS -- TO AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER THAT'S THE A PLUS THE FIFTY SO WE WERE GIVING SOMEONE A SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS IS COMING YEAR HOPEFULLY WE WILL DO SOME MORE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND ALL OF THE KINDS OF TRAINING THAT. WE HAVE TO DO BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT SOMETHING TO COME FROM THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. THANK YOU -- WE DID NOT ON THE PUBLIC. SAFETY SUBCOMMITTEE AND SENATE DID NOT SPECIFY IT FOR THE DE pESCALATION TRAINING ONLY BECAUSE WE HAD PROVIDED THE FUNDING LAST YEAR AND ONLY THIRTY THOUSAND OF IT WAS SPENT. SO WE CERTAINLY SEE THE NEED WE WE ARE OPEN VERY OPEN AND SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE POST REALLY IMPROVES ITS CURRICULUM FOR USE OF FORCE TRAINING. AND WE OR YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOUR SUPPORT OF THAT WOULD HAVE APPROVED THE MONEY THE PREVIOUS YEAR. BUT BECAUSE THAT MONEY HAD NOT EVEN YET BEEN TH -- SPENT BUT WE ALSO NOTED AND THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION IT ALSO NOTED THAT WE HAVE SOME DEFICITS IN POST FUNDING OVERALL. AND SO WE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF HELPING TO ADDRESS EVEN THOSE DEFICIT SO. QUESTION ON THIS. ON ISSUE. NINETEEN SEE NONE WILL HOLD THAT ANA ITEM OVER. WE DID WE ALREADY COMMENCED WITH -- ITEM TWENTY THREE COMPLETE THAT. THE THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION TODAY AT THIS POINT WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HAVING. A BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MEETING TOMORROW WEDNESDAY. WE WILL HAVE ONE ON THURSDAY AND IT WILL BE UPON THE CALL OF THE CHAIR. WITH THAT WE STAND ADJOURNED THANK YOU
