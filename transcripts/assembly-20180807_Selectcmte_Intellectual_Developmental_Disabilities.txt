I'M AS WE'VE KIND OF FINISH THROUGHOUT THIS MORNING -- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES SYSTEM AND TO PROVIDE A LITTLE CONTEXT BETWEEN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU THIS OVERVIEW AND TAKE YOU BACK A LITTLE BIT IN TIME. SO -- TWO THE DEVELOPMENTAL -- SERVICE SYSTEM -- AS A DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WE OPERATE ON IN CALIFORNIA AND I HAVE A PACKET FOR YOU. AND FOR THAT MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE I'M AND FOR THOSE THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED ORGAN ACTUALLY POSTED. THE PACKET ONLINE SO WE'LL HAVE IT ON OUR WEBSITE WHERE ALL THE MATERIAL WILL BE AVAILABLE ON A LINK. I'M SO M. IN YOUR PACKET YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN OVERVIEW. OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS YOU HAVE THAT MAP BUT ON WITHIN THE FIRST FEW PAGES WE ALSO HAVE OUR SAFETY NET REPORT AND WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT ALL BE REFERRING BACK. TO ON THROUGHOUT ON THE MORNING -- DDS IS RESPONSIBLE -- FOR UNDER THE LANHAM ACT ON TO OVERSEE THE COORDINATION THE PROVISION OF SERVICES FOR JUST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA. PROVIDING SUPPORTS AND SERVICES TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF CEREBRAL PALSY INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. AUTISM ABSOLUTE EPILEPSY AND ALSO RELATED CONDITIONS. THE DEPARTMENT SETS BROAD POLICY AND PROVIDE STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP ESTABLISHED SHE'D PRIORITIES STANDARDS. PROCEDURES WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES PROGRAM IN WHICH WE OPERATE MONITORS REVIEWS AND I VALUE RATES OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. BY WAY OF HISTORY THE CALIFORNIA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS STARTED -- GOES BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN FIFTIES IN ON CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER IS A DEVELOPMENTAL SORT OF STILL IN OPERATION TODAY WHILE IT'S CLOSING BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR -- IT WAS AND IS THE OLDEST FACILITY IN OPERATION AND OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM GOING BACK. TO EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES ON PARENTS LEGISLATORS HAD TAKEN A LOOK AT ENSURING THAT SERVICES WERE GOING TO BE DELIVERED DIFFERENTLY THAT WITHIN INSTITUTIONS AND TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WERE. IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AB SIX NINETY ONE WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ESTABLISHING TO PILOT REGIONAL CENTERS WHICH ARE NOW. FRANK D. LETTERMAN REGIONAL CENTER AND GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER WHICH IS LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE LANHAM ACT CREATED A VISION FOR A STRUCTURE OF A COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA ASSISTANCE PROVEN OUR SYSTEM HAS REALLY PROVEN TO BE A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE NATION. AND IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN A STATE CAN BE PROVIDED WITH AN ENTITLEMENT SYSTEM. THE LETTERMAN ACT STIPULATES THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED -- TO A NUMBER OF RIGHTS INCLUDING THE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT FACILITATE THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE IN THE WRIST LEAST RESTRICTIVE. SETTINGS IN THE COMMUNITY OF THEIR CHOICE. THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO CONTINUE TO OF ALL. AND WE CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE NEW IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE CHOICES THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL. TODAY THE LANHAM ACT -- PROVIDE SERVICES THROUGH A NETWORK OF TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS AND AGAIN IN EUROPE -- IN YOUR PACKET YOU HAVE A MAP OF ALL REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE LAW DICTATES THAT THE DEPARTMENT DDS. AND THE RESULTS CENTERS HAVE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS DETERMINE PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY PROVIDE SUPPORT AND CARE COORDINATION AND CONTRACT WITH COMMUNION PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. DECISIONS ARE MADE BASED ON THAT THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FOCUSED ON ON THE PERSON AND NOT AS OUTLINED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLAN. BY DESIGN THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DIRECT ROLE IN THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IPP. DDS CURRENTLY OPERATES AS A STATE DEPARTMENT WE OPERATE THREE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN THE STATE ONE COMMUNITY FACILITY WE HAVE TO MOBILE CRISIS FACILITIES AND OPERATE TO ACUTE CRISIS STABILIZATION. HOMES UNDER THE DEPARTMENTS -- SAFETY NET PLAN WE HAVE A PLAN TO IT -- EXPANDS THE US STABILIZATION HOMES IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND A SAFETY NET PLAN IS ALSO INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKET AND AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. TODAY IN -- FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET FOR SERVICE DELIVERY IN CALIFORNIA IS SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH TWO POINT. NINE BILLION IS AND FEDERAL FUNDS AND REIMBURSEMENTS. OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THE LANHAM ACT HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS IT'S INVOLVED IN HAS ALSO HAD SOME CHALLENGES. THIS INCLUDES SOME OF THE THE CUTS THAT OCCURRED IN I'M DURING THE GREAT RECESSION BACK IN TWELVE SOME OF THESE CUTS INCLUDED CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR EARLY START SUSPEND SUSPENSION AND LIMITATIONS TO SOME OF THE PURCHASE OF SERVICES TO INCLUDE SOCIAL RACK CAMP. AND ALSO ON RESPITE. THERE'S ALSO REDUCTIONS TO WRIGGLE CENTER OPERATIONS THERE WAS I'M SEPARATE FREEZERS INCREASING PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY. FOCUS ON CHANGING AND CLOSING THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND MAJOR EFFORTS TO INCREASE FEDERAL FUNDING. CHANGES IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM IS NOW IN A PRETTY AND AND SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANT ERA OF CHANGE AND WE'RE SEEING THAT SIGNIFICANT TRANSITION OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE HAVE REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. I'M WE HAD SAUCE CHANGES OCCURRING IN TWO THOUSAND NINE IN THE REDUCTION IN CHANGES OF THE CLOSURE OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS TWO THOUSAND NINE THE LAST PERSON FROM AGNES DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. I MOVED FROM -- THAT -- STATE OPERATED FACILITY FOURTEEN LETTERMAN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER ALSO CLOSED YOU DO HAVE IN YOUR PACKET THERE'S A CHART THAT REFLECTS. I'M FOR PRIOR YEARS AND I CAN AND GIVE YOU THE PAGE NUMBER IF YOU WOULD LIKE. TO JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHANGES OF THE DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN THE POPULATION OVER THE YEARS. AND IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT I CAN EVEN GIVE YOU THE REFERENCE OF THAT PAGE -- SO YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE THREE PROMPTED THE CHANGES AS FAR AS THE POPULATION WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND THEN YOU ALSO SEE ON PAGE. FOUR WHERE YOU'RE SEEING THE INCREASE IN THE REGIONAL CENTER POPULATION. SO IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AS A THERE IS A MORATORIUM OF EMISSIONS AND ALL DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND THIS IS A IMPORTANT TIME IN THE CHANGES OF OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. OF NOTE IS BECAUSE AT THAT POINT INDIVIDUALS WITH THE MOST COMPLEX DEEDS BOTH WITH THE BEHAVIOR CHALLENGES AS WELL AS MEDICAL NEEDS. WERE NO LONGER ADMITTED INTO A DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. THIS WAS REALLY THE FOCUS THEN ON LOOKING AT HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH THE MOST COMPLEX DEEDS. WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY SERVICE SYSTEM WE STARTED THE NEW MODELS OF SERVICE THAT WERE BEING DEVELOPED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE NEEDS -- INTO -- THOUSAND THIRTEEN UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THERE IS A CREATION OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER TASK FORCE TO FOCUS ON INFORMING US ON WHAT WAS GOING TO BE THE FUTURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS -- SHORTLY BEHIND THAT WAS ONCE IT WAS DEFINED AS FAR AS THE FUTURE PLAN FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE REMAINING DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THE CHANGE IN THE FOCUS OF THE WORK OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS TASK FORCE. FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT IS A SERVICE DELIVERY AND CAN -- SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE PRIORITY AREAS WHERE THE PRESSURES AND WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AS FAR AS ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. MOVING FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND THERE'S A LAW THAT WAS SIGNED. AS FAR AS MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WHILE IT'S TAKEN A NUMBER OF YEARS. ON WE ARE IN A PLACE WHERE WE'RE GONNA SEE IMPLEMENTATION BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. ON SELF DETERMINATION AS OFFERING INDIVIDUALS REALLY THE FREEDOM AND THE ABILITY TO MANAGE IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING THEIR CONTROLS AND THEIR BUDGETS AS FAR AS HOW THEY WANT. TO CHOOSE THAT SERVICES THEY WANT TO HAVE WITHIN THEIR LIFE. ALSO TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE SAW THE EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY THAT WAS PASSED IN IS NOW UNDER THE LANHAM ACT. IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN GOES THERE IS A RELEASE OF THE NEW FEDERAL RULE ON FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE HOMING COMMUNITY SERVICES AND MUCH. ON COMPLIANCE WOULD NEED TO BE ON AVAILABLE NEEDS TO BE MET BY STATE IN THE U. S. THAT HAS REIMBURSEMENT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR H. CBS. ARM FUNDING AND SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR TRANSITION PLANNING. AND THE REQUIREMENT OF THAT IS IN. TWENTY THAT IS I CAN A FRIGGIN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE FULL COMPLIANCE FOR THE H. CBS FINAL RULE. IN -- TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AS AND MENTION WE MOVE THE LAST PERSON FROM LETTERMAN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. ON BUT WE ARE ALSO IN THOSE FINAL STAGES OF CLOSING OF THREE REMAINING SO NOW MY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FAIRVIEW AND PORTERVILLE WE WOULD SEE LAST PERSON MOVE IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN M. WITH A NO LATER TO CLOSURE. TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY INDIVIDUALS REMAINING IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER THAT WOULD BE CLOSING. I DO WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST A A PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE. AND WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US AS A SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE AS WE'RE LOOKING AND DEVELOPING SERVICES AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE POPULATION THAT WERE SURVEYED TODAY BUT ALSO THE POPULATION THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT SERVING IN THE FUTURE. I'M I HAD MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE WITHIN OUR POPULATION. 39% ARE HISPANIC AMERICAN. AND THE REST ARE WITHIN THE DIFFERENT AND ETHNICITIES WE DO HAVE A VERY VERY DIVERSE POPULATION WE HAVE TWENTY THREE DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES AND OUR POPULATION THAT WERE IDENTIFYING SPEAKS ABOUT FORTY FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. 48% OF THE CONSUMER POPULATION IS UNDER THE AGE OF 2238% OF OUR POPULATION HAS A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM. 80% OF THE POPULATION LIVE AT HOME OR WITH THEIR FAMILY OR IN THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT LIVING ON SETTING. WITHIN THAT THE CHANGES WE ARE SEEING ABOUT THIRTEEN TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS WITHIN OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM EACH YEAR. SO SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO CURRENT YEAR WE'VE SEEN A 42% INCREASE IN OUR POPULATION. SIZE OF REGIONAL CENTERS VERY BETWEEN THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED AS THE SMALLEST TO THE LARGEST BEING. THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND YEP AN ETHNICITY IS ALSO CHANGING WHERE WE'RE SEEING A SHIFT WORK. TEN YEARS AGO THIS SUMMER TO THE CALIFORNIA ON DEMOGRAPHICS THAT WE'RE SEEING CHANGES IS THAT 40% OF THE INDIVIDUALS OF THE POPULATION WAS WHITE BACK AND A TEN YEARS AGO REPRESENTING. THIRTEEN AT 32% TODAY WHERE THIS IS CHANGING OUR HISPANIC POPULATION NEXT INCREASING WHICH IS CHANGING FROM 33% 239%. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION REGARDING THE INEQUITIES IN SPENDING WITHIN THE DIFFERENT ON POPULATIONS BETWEEN WHITE AND NOT WHITE AND NON WHITE. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT THE GROWTH WITHIN THE POPULATION WE ALSO KNOW THAT 50% OF THE HISPANIC POPULATION WITH AND AND THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO WERE ALSO SEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AS FAR AS THE GROWTH. OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM. TEN YEARS AGO APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS OF OUR POPULATION NIGHT REPRESENTING 19%. I'M HAD AUTISM TODAY WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING THAT. THIRTY EIGHT I'M PERCENT HAVE A A A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM. OF NOTE IS THAT 80% OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AYE REGIONAL CENTERS CONSUMERS THAT HAVE AUTISM. 80% AS I SAID ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO SO IT'S WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT DEVELOPING RESOURCES WHAT WE DO AS A A DEPARTMENT AND WHAT WE DO IN WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT OTHER PRESSURES WITHIN THE SYSTEM. BUT ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WAS THE FACE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE SERVING HOW IS THAT CHANGING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT THEIR NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. I'M YOU ALSO HAVE AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL AND DATA AND AND FACTS ABOUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE IS AND THE FACT BOOK THAT IS A PART OF YOUR PACKET TODAY. IN RECENT YEARS LEGEND THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESTORE SOME OF THE THE CUTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE ADDRESSED IS THE STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE YEARS. AND THEN ALSO WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB EX TWO ONE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RESTORATION AS FAR SOME SERVICES TO INCLUDE -- ADDRESSING OUR EARLY START AS THE RESPITE SERVICES AND SOME OF THAT I'M RIGHT IDENTIFYING HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD FORWARD WITH ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OF THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE STILL HEAR FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES WITH THAT OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I CONTINUE TO SAY OVER AND OVER IS THAT WE ARE A SYSTEM OF PARTNERS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE DO IS WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY AND MAKING SURE THAT. AS PART OF OUR FOCUS AND MOVING FORWARD WITH A PLAN FOR HOW WE ADDRESS SERVICES IS LISTEN TO WHAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE. WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY FOR FAMILIES PARTICULARLY IN OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES UMPTEEN ABLE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE SYSTEM. WE'RE HEARING THAT THE BAND FOR INCREASED SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH VERY COMPLEX NEEDS PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH VERY SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIOR CHALLENGES WE SEE THAT PARTICULARLY WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. ARE YOUNGER WITH AUTISM WITH HAVE COCOA OUR CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE WERE ALSO HEARING THAT THE COMMUNITY BASED IN STATE OPERATED SERVICES AN OPERATION MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED OVER TIME WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS. OUR SAFETY NET TO SEE HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND SUPPORT THE COMPLEX NEEDS -- WE'RE ALSO -- ADDRESSING THAT THE QUESTION AS FAR AS THE RATE STUDY BUT THE RATE STUDY IS DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PART OF THE RATE STUDY IS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO -- I RATE SURVEY OF SERVICE PROVIDERS -- WE HAD IT WORKING WITH OUR CONSULTANTS THAT IS DOING THE SURVEY. THE TARGET WAS TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SAMPLE OF ABOUT 40% I'M I'M I'M PLEASED TO REPORT TODAY THAT ACTUALLY OUR COMMUNITY HAS JUST DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB. AND MORE ABOUT -- WERE VERY VERY CLOSE 250% RESPONSE RATE -- WATCHES AS VERY INCREDIBLE AND I I REALLY HAVE TO COMMIT OUR COMMANDER COMMUNITY FOR FOR BEING RESPONSIVE TO THAT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE FOCUSING ON PRIMARILY ON ON WORKING AGAIN WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TAKING A LOOK AT COMPLETING THE SAFE TRANSITION OF EVERYBODY. WITHIN A DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER ON COMPLETING THE RATE STUDY CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE INEQUITIES IN SPENDING ADDRESSING SOME OF THE SERVICE DELIVERY NEEDS. I'M WORKING WITH REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE COMMUNITY AS FAR AS DEVELOPING THOSE NEEDED SERVICES AND TARGETED AREAS. ON FURTHERING SOME OF THE EFFORTS ON INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ALSO MAKING SURE WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THE SUSTAINABLE HOUSING. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS HOW WE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND AGAIN BEING ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE AND AND IDENTIFYING THE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE -- I CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND SEEING HOW WE CAN BEST ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDE YOU INFORMATION WHILE YOU DO YOUR IMPORTANT WORK. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MAKE YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL MR LOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW. NAM I'M STILL DIGESTING ALL OF THAT INFORMATION LET ME JUST SIT YOU MENTION THE RATE STUDY AND I REFERENCED IN MY OPENING REMARKS. SO MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN THE RATE STUDY WILL BE COMPLETED WHAT DO YOU [inaudible] ANTICIPATE WILL COME FROM THAT RATE STUDY MEET WE DON'T DO STUDIES JUST TO STAY WHY BECAUSE WE SORT OF DO SOMETIMES JUST STUDY THINGS AND DON'T ACT. BUT WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE DOING WITH THE INFORMATION THAT IS SURFACED IN THE RATE STUDY AND WHAT A KIND OF AUTONOMY DO YOU HAVE AS THE DIRECTOR. TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS SIZE YOU SEE APPROPRIATE OR WILL THAT REALLY LAY AND BACK IN OUR LAP HOW DO YOU VIEW THAT. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION A COUPLE THINGS I'D LIKE TO JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- AGAIN THE PROCESS IN WHICH WERE ALSO WORKING THROUGH THE RATE STUDY -- I MENTIONED THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE ON THE FOCUS AREAS WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE INCLUDES LOOKING AT THE RATES. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR RATE WORK GROUP AND THAT DEVELOPMENT SERVICES TASK FORCE. TO IBM TO INFORM US ON WHAT THAT THE ACTUAL SURVEY WOULD LOOK LIKE SO WE'VE WE'RE ABLE TO PUT THAT FORWARD NAY THEM WORKING WITH OUR CONTRACTOR. SO THAT INFORMATION WILL THEN COME WE WILL GO AHEAD AND AND WORK WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. I'M AND PRESENT THE INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE SO IT DOES GO BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WE WILL BE ABLE. TO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP. THROUGH THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN THOSE. DIAZ TASK FORCE TO SHORTEN TO USE AN ACRONYM IF I MAY. UM WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF ALSO DOING A FAMILY SURVEY LISTENING TO THE FAMILIES IN ADDITION AND SAYING WELL WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT OUTCOMES SO WE JUST RECENTLY DID AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONTRACT. OR FINALIZING THAT TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE A SURVEY THAT'S GOING TO GO OUT TO FAMILIES TO ALSO HAVE THAT PIECE SO TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THAT. WE WILL THEN TAKE WILL TAKE IT DIGEST IT ALSO BRING THAT BACK WITHIN OUR DEVELOPMENT SERVICES -- WORK GROUP AND THEN WE WILL AND BE REPORTING THAT OUT I'M BY DESIGN -- EARLY PART OF THIS NEXT YEAR ENGLISH IS. SOME MEMORABLE KALINKA JUST REALLY QUICKLY -- IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU MENTIONED -- THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF YOUR WHOLE DEPARTMENT AND ALL THE DIFFERENT. THINGS THERE'S A LOT THERE. WHAT IS JUST FROM MY KNOWLEDGE OF CRISIS HOME OR AN ACUTE CRISIS HOME? VERSUS THE STABILIZATION TEAMS AND DIRECT YOU KNOW HOW THOSE WORK ANA BOTH THANK YOU. SO WITHIN THEIR REGIONAL CENTERS AND AGAIN TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY ON A BROAD RANGE OF SERVICES AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES. I'M WITH THE AND THERE I'M GEOGRAPHIC AREA THERE ARE TIMES HOWEVER THAT SOME OF THE NEEDS MAY BE BEYOND SOME OF THE CAPACITY WITHIN THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED WHETHER IT'S WITHIN -- THAT RESULTS CENTER SERVICES BUT ALSO SOMETIMES EVEN WITHIN SOME OF THE THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES. WE WE HAVE A GREAT PARTNERS WITHIN THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH IN IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. MAY HAVE SPECIAL AND DIFFERENT NEEDS SO PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS THROUGH THE SAFETY NETWORK AS FAR AS ST HOW DO WE SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH THE MOST COMPLEX NEEDS. CONCERNS OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE MOVING INDIVIDUALS TO THE COMMUNITY WAS SAYING THE STATE PLAYS A ROLE IN IMPORTANT ROLE OF SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS AND SO. QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURES OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IT WAS WITH -- UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE STILL GOING TO BE SOME LIMITED OPERATION WITHIN THE STATE ONES ONE WAS WITH FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE A PART OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BUT THE OTHER WAS WITH SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE VERY COMPLEX BEHAVIOR CHALLENGES AGAIN INDIVIDUALS TYPICALLY WITH CO OCCURRING NEEDS. AND PART OF THAT WAS THEN THE STABILIZATION CRISIS STABILIZATION VERY SMALL SO NO MORE THAN FIVE INDIVIDUALS LIMITED TO WHERE THERE'S A PROFESSIONALS AND WE HAVE A VERY -- CUT COMPLEMENT TO PROFESSIONALS WORKING WITHIN THE STATE THAT INCLUDES PSYCHOLOGIST SITE TAX NURSES PHYSICIANS THAT WILL WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS TO ASSIST. YOU KNOW FROM -- PHARMACOLOGY SO THE MEDICATIONS BUT MORE ANA A VERY POSITIVE INFORMED APPROACH IN MAKING SURE THAT THE PERSON HAS. BEEN NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM STABILIZE TRANSITION BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. IT IS TIME LIMITED IT'S NO MORE THAN THIRTEEN MONTHS AND THE STATE OPERATED SO IT'S A RESIDENTIAL SETTING CURRENTLY AT TO DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER IS ONE IS THAT CINEMA. ONE IS AT FAIRVIEW BUT BE BECAUSE WE'RE CLOSING THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WE ARE NOW GOING TO BE MOVING THOSE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. AS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS THOSE SERVICES WILL BE MOVING TO THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION WE ESTABLISHED A SPACE -- A MOBILE CRISIS TEAM SO AGAIN A SIMILAR COMPLEMENT OF PROFESSIONALS THAT THAT ARE NOT ONLY -- THEY DON'T JUST WORK WITHIN A RESIDENTIAL SETTING THEY CAN GO TO THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE PERSON KNOWS TO HELP STABILIZE THE SITUATION. ON TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF THE INDIVIDUAL GOING TO A RESTRICTIVE SETTING MAYBE AND THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTER OR GOING TO A INSTITUTE FOR MENTAL DISEASES THAT MAY BE RESTRICTIVE AND NOT ABLE. TO I MEET THEIR IMMEDIATE NEED SO THE FIRST PRIORITY OF STABILIZE A PERSON IN THEIR OWN HOME WHERE THEY'RE CURRENTLY LIVING I'M AND THAT WOULD BE THE INTENT OF THE MOBILE ACUTE CRISIS TEAM AND THEN. IN THE EVENT THAT THAT CANNOT OCCUR THEN IT -- THEY WOULD BE EXPLORING THE WE'RE REDUCING THE RELIANCE ON RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE BUILDING THE CAPACITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SMALLER SETTING SOME STATE OPERATED SOME REGIONAL CENTER DRIVEN. THANK YOU. MERELY QUESTIONS OF PAL. DOCTOR I WANT TO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE OF A REAL GOOD RELATIONSHIP ON PARTNERING WITH THIS COMMITTEE ON HOW WE CAN. HELP EACH OTHER -- MOVE FORWARD TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE CARE ABOUT THE MOST AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- YOU KNOW IS GLARINGLY -- PARENT IS. OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED MORE FUNDING BECAUSE YOUR CENSUS IS GROWING. AND THE ABILITY TO LOVE FOR PROVIDERS AND IT MAY HAVE TO BE A CAREER CHOICE FOR SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE CONSISTENCY ISN'T IT BETTER NEEDED BY SOME OF THE YOUR CONSUMERS -- SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HOW WE CAN PARTNER AND AND MAKE IT A BETTER -- OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU AND US TO TO US ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE DO CARE SO. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND AND I CAN SAY WE'RE GONNA DO THIS TO HAVE SIX YEARS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD TO ON OUR SECOND PANEL THAT WILL BE -- MARK EXCUSE ME YET MARK NEWTON -- THE DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND SONYA A PANIC OF A SENIOR FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LA NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WAS LEFT THIS HAVE THE LA NO -- AS PART OF OUR PANELISTS PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M SONYA PADDICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND AS YOU NOTED THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE MARTIN IT MARK NEWTON DEPUTY. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AT THE LA AUTO. I WE'VE BEEN ASKED INVITED HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW ABOUT THE DDS BUDGET AND DISCUSS SOME OF THE RECENT BUDGET ACTIONS AND HISTORICAL TRENDS. AND YOU SHOULD HAVE A HANDOUTS FROM OUR OFFICE -- THAT LOOKS LIKE. IN ALL DISPUTES OF FOLLOWING ALONG -- TO THE STRUCTURE OF THIS HANDOUT. SO PAGE ONE PROVIDES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT A FIRST TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BASICS OF THE DTS BUDGET AND THEN -- BRIEFLY DISCUSS HOW THE CLOSURE OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WILL IMPACT THE DDS BUDGET AND THEN TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE RECENT ACTIONS OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. AND SOME OF THE FUTURE FISCAL CHALLENGES LOOKING AHEAD I'LL TRY NOT TO REPEAT -- TOO MUCH OF WHAT DIRECTOR BARGE BEEN PRESENTED -- BUT ALL OF MY COMMENTS WILL BE FROM SERVE A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT. THE CURRENT DDS BUDGET IN. TWENTY IS AT A RECORD HIGH OF SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND ABOUT 61% OF THIS COMES FROM IF YOU ACTUALLY TURNED TO THE FIGURE ON PAGE THREE YOU'LL NOTE THAT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS IN THE DDS BUDGET YOU'LL SEE THERE WAS SORT OF A STALL. WHEN BUDGET CUTS HAD TO BE MADE DURING THE RECESSION? AND YOU ALSO NOTE THESE RAPID INCREASE IN CASE LOW GROWTH BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE GROWTH IN THE DDS BUDGET ACTUALLY OUT PIECES GROWTH IN THE DDS CASELOAD AND THIS IS IN PART -- DUE TO CHANGES IN IN UTILIZATION OF SERVICES IT'S ALSO DUE IN LARGE PART. TO THE STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES WHICH THE STATE HAS FUNDED FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE DTS SYSTEM. THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES ITS FUNDING FROM THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND AS WELL AS FROM FEDERAL FUNDS AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR YOU'LL SEE THE RELATIVE SHARES OF GENERAL FUND IN FEDERAL FUND -- FEDERAL FUNDS OVER THE PAST A NUMBER OF YEARS -- FEDERAL FUNDS ARE PROMOTE PROVIDED PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF REIMBURSEMENTS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICAID WAIVER RELATED SERVICES THAT THE DEPARTMENT -- HELPS PROVIDE THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTERS. YOU'LL KNOW IN THE FIGURE ON PAGE FOUR THAT AGAIN -- AS DIRECTOR PARCHMAN NOTED THE THE RELATIVE BURDEN ON THE GENERAL FUND WAS REDUCED DURING THE RECESSION WHILE THE DEPARTMENT WAS ABLE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SINCE THAT TIME HOWEVER GENERAL FUND GROWTH HAS OUTPACED GROWTH -- FROM FEDERAL SOURCES OF FUNDING. IF YOU'LL TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF THIS DISCUSS THE TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE DDS -- BUDGET THESE ARE THE SAME COMPONENTS THAT DIRECTOR BURGEONING DISCUSS BUT WILL AGAIN TAKE A LOOK THROUGH FISCAL LANDS -- THE FIRST MAJOR COMPONENT AS THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM WHICH CAN PROVIDES THE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR DTS CONSUMERS. THE REGIONAL CENTER BUDGET IS COMPRISED OF AN OPERATIONS BUDGETS OPERATIONS BUDGET FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS THEMSELVES WHICH INCLUDES FUNDING -- FOR SERVICE COORDINATOR STAFF AND THE LIKE. I'M AND IT ALSO INCLUDES THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE BUDGET AND THIS IS REALLY WHERE. THE BULK OF THE DDS BUDGET ALLIES MORE THAN 80% OF THE TOTAL DDS BUDGET IS IN THE PURCHASE OF SERVICES. FROM A NETWORK OF MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND VENDORS ACROSS THE STATE WHO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES TO CONSUMERS. SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BEFORE REGIONAL CENTERS CAN PAY FOR THESE SERVICES DIRECTLY THEY MUST FIRST EXHAUST. ANY -- QUOTE UNQUOTE GENERIC SOURCES OF FUNDING SO THIS MAY INCLUDE OTHER PUBLIC SOURCES OF FUNDING LIKE MEDI CAL. OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ALSO PRIVATE SOURCES OF FUNDING SUCH AS A PERSON'S OR FAMILIES -- PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE. THE OTHER MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE DDS BUDGET OUR THE STATE OPERATED RESIDENTIAL AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES. THIS IS MADE UP OF THE THREE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THAT WILL BE CLOSING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS CURRENTLY THERE BUDGET IS CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IT ALSO IS MADE UP OF THE FACILITIES THAT WILL NOT BE CLOSING SO THAT OF THE DEPARTMENT OPERATES A SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM AT THE PORTERVILLE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BUT SORRY CANYON SPRINGS COMMUNITY FACILITY. THESE TWO FACILITIES WILL REMAIN OPEN INDEFINITELY AND CURRENTLY COST ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH MOST OF THE FUNDING COMING FROM THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. FINALLY THERE ARE THE SAFETY NET AND CRISIS SERVICES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED. A PARTICULARLY AS THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS CLOSE AND THE STATE HAS TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OUT IN COMMUNITY BASED FACILITIES -- THERE IT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION -- TO MAKING SURE THERE ARE ENOUGH RESOURCES FOR THOSE PURPOSES. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN WE'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE IMPACT THAT THE CLOSURE OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WILL HAVE ON THE DTS BUDGET. IT'S GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE TO SERVE PEOPLE IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS THAN IT IS TO RUN. INSTITUTIONS -- HOWEVER AND THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSING THESE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS -- THE FIRST ARE THE COMMUNITY PLACEMENT COSTS OF THIS DOES A DTS HAS BEEN PROVIDED -- FUNDING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS TO BEGIN DEVELOPING RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING. OUT OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN IN INTO COMMUNITY HOMES. AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO PAY FOR JUST THE CUT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING THOSE FOLKS INTO THE COMMUNITY. THERE'S ALSO THE COST TO DEVELOP THE SAFETY NET IN THE COMMUNITY NOW THAT DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WILL NO LONGER BE THAT PLACE OF LAST RESORT FOR CONSUMERS IN CRISIS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. EIGHT WE DO OUR OFFICE DOES ESTIMATE HOWEVER THAT THERE WILL BE SOME NET SAVINGS TO THE SYSTEM ONCE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ARE FINALLY CLOSED. WE ESTIMATE THAT IN TERMS OF OPERATIONAL COSTS THE STATE COULD SAVE UP TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT MOST FROM THE GENERAL FUND RELATIVE TO THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ONCE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ARE CLOSED. THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY THAT REVENUES COULD BE RAISED THROUGH THE SET SALE OR LEASE OF THE PROPERTIES WHICH THE DECIES ARE HOUSE JOHN -- BUT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES WILL BE HIGHLY -- DEPENDENT ON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH OF THOSE PROPERTIES AS WELL AS DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE BY THE VARIOUS. A GOVERNMENTAL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ON PAGE NINE I I WON'T GO INTO ALL OF THESE SINCE I'M DIRECTOR BURGE MEN DID ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THESE -- THESE ITEMS BUT WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MAJOR BUDGET ACTIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS -- FIRST TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THE BUDGET SOLUTIONS -- THAT WERE MADE DURING THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. AND THERE WAS A NAMELY A REDUCTION IN BENEFITS IN TERMS OF TIGHTENING THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IN THE EARLY START PROGRAM AND THIS WAS IN ORDER TO REDUCE CASELOAD. GROWTH -- AND THAT'S REDUCE COST THAT ELIGIBILITY WAS RESTORED -- IN BEGINNING IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN SOCIAL A RECREATION CAMP SERVICES WERE SUSPENDED AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN RESTORED -- EN RESPITE THE AMOUNT OF RESPITE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL COULD RECEIVE WAS LIMITED -- THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET DID RESTORE THE FULL AMOUNT OF A RESPITE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL. AND THERE WERE ALSO WHAT WERE CALLING RESTRICTIONS TO VENDOR RATES THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WERE RATE FREEZES SOME OF WHICH STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE FOUR AND AFFECTING SOME VENDORS AND THEN OTHERS IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE THESE FREEZES STILL REMAIN IN PLACE DESPITE THE STATE PROVIDING FUNDING TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES -- AND OF THE THE RATE INCREASES THAT OCCURRED IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN I WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDIAN RATES HAS ALSO RESTRICTED THE AMOUNT THAT VENDORS RECEIVE SO THE MEDIAN RATES ARE ESSENTIALLY -- THE RATES THAT A NEW VENDOR COMING INTO THE SYSTEM WOULD RECEIVE RATHER THAN BEING ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THEIR RATE BASED ON IT ON COST. THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THE CURRENT STATEWIDE MEDIAN RATE FOR THAT SERVICE OR THE REGIONAL CENTER AREA RATE FOR THAT SERVICE WHICHEVER OF THE TWO IS LOWER. THAT MEDIAN RATE POLICY REMAINS IN PLACE. ON PAGE TEN WE MENTION -- SEVERAL OTHER SORT OF BUDGET SOLUTIONS THAT ABOUT THAT OCCURRED DURING THE RECENT RECESSION -- SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN RESTORED LIKE PAYMENT REDUCTIONS. THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE WAS ONE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TO ESSENTIALLY -- BUT DESPITE IT BEING CALLED THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY POLICY WOULD ESSENTIALLY MEANT WAS THAT REGIONAL CENTERS WERE PROHIBITED FROM PAYING. FIRST A VENDORS FOR SERVICES PROVIDED ON FOURTEEN SET DAYS PER YEAR. THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE ADMINISTRATION HAD PROPOSED BEGINNING TO RIP TO ENFORCE THIS POLICY AGAIN IT'S BEEN SUSPENDED SINCE. TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE HAD VOTED TO REPEAL THE POLICY ALL TOGETHER THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS REACHED WAS TO DELAY ENFORCEMENT OF THE POLICY FOR ONE MORE YEAR. SOME OF THE RECENT BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS -- WE DON'T NEED TO GO INTO TOO MUCH DEPTH ON NEEDS BUT YOU'LL NOTE AND AND PAGE. ELEVEN THE MAJOR ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN DURING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SPECIAL SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE SOME OF THESE INVOLVED. RE INCREASES FOR VENDORS A AND I AND INCREASES TO REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS THERE ALSO SOME FIXED ALLOCATIONS PROVIDED FOR SOME SPECIFIC PURPOSES SUCH AS AMELIORATING THE DISPARITIES IN PURCHASE OF SERVICE SPENDING ACROSS RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS -- AMONG A D. S. CONSUMERS. THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET RESTORED RESPITE -- AND PROVIDED ONE TIME FUNDING FOR SAFETY NET DEVELOPMENT THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PROVIDED. TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN WHAT'S CALLED BRIDGE FUNDING AND THIS IS FOR VENDORS WHO ARE BE BEING PARTICULIER PARTICULARLY HARD HIT BY RISING COSTS AND IT'S MEANT TO BRIDGE THE THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE RATE STUDY CAN BE POTENTIALLY IMPLEMENTED -- ON PAGES TWELVE THROUGH -- FOURTEEN WE WANTED TO NOTE SOME OF THE LOOKING AHEAD AND I WON'T DWELL TOO LONG -- IN THIS SECTION BECAUSE DIRECTOR BRIDGMAN DID ALREADY DISCUSSED SOME OF THESE AND I KNOW SOME OF THE PANELISTS COMING FOR REMOVAL WILL TALK ABOUT THESE BUT WE JUST WANTED TO NOTE TWO FACTORS THAT ARE CAUSING SHIFTS IN THE DTS SYSTEM. ONE AS THE SHIFTING DEMOGRAPHICS WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED AGAIN BUT WE WOULD JUST NOTE FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE EACH OF THESE SHIPS COMES WITH. SORT OF FISCAL PRESSURE SO FOR EXAMPLE OF THE RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WITH AUTISM AND DUAL MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS. MEANS IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO SERVE THESE CONSUMERS THEN MAYBE A OF MORE AVERAGE CONSUMER FROM THE PAST. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE EVOLVING MODES OF SERVICE DELIVERY AS THE DIRECTOR ALREADY DISCUSSED A PAGE THIRTEEN NOTES A FEW OF THESE DE INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND MOVING TO A A SYSTEM THAT'S ALMOST A THE NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THE STATEMENTS COMPLY WITH IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCTING TEN YEAR RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDING WHICH REALLY TRIES TO INCREASE INTEGRATION OF CONSUMERS AND TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THE NEW SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM THAT IS BEING ROLLED OUT. I WE WOULD NOTE AS HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED THERE'S THE UPCOMING RATE STUDY. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE STUDY IS THAT THE RATES STRUCTURE IN THE DTS SYSTEM. IS VERY COMPLEX IT'S EVEN COMPLEX ON PAPER JUST HOW -- AND RATES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SET THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF WAYS THAT RATES CAN BE SET THERE'S MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SERVICE CODES. BUT THIS STRUCTURE HAS BEEN MADE EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BY THE BUDGET SOLUTIONS AND SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS TO AUGMENT AND RESTORE THE DDS BUDGET SINCE THAT TIME. I IT'S MADE -- FOR RATE STRUCTURE THAT IS IN. THAT'S IN EQUITABLE ACROSS VENDORS PROVIDING THE SAME SERVICES. IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE SENSE THAT -- NUMBER OF VENDORS ARE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY AND IT PROVIDES A DISINCENTIVE TO NEW VENDORS COMING INTO THE SYSTEM -- AND IT'S AND IT'S QUITE RIGID SO THE REASON FOR THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THIS RATE STUDY WAS REALLY TO ASSESS THE STRUCTURE -- AND A EVALUATE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES FOR SETTING RATES AND THEN HOPEFULLY PROVIDE SOME GOOD ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SIMPLIFYING THE STRUCTURE -- FINALLY ON PAGE FOURTEEN WE WOULD JUST NOTE -- A COUPLE OTHER ISSUES FACING THE SYSTEM -- ONE IS THIS NOTION OF DEVELOPING RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY. I HOUSING HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED AS AS A PROBLEM BUT THERE THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND VENDORS HAVE REALLY BEEN RESTRICTED FROM STARTING UP NEW PROGRAMS IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO FUNDING CHALLENGES -- AND IN SEVENTEEN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR PROVIDED -- DDS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO USE THE THE PART OF FUNDING THAT THEY GET TO DEVELOP RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR PEOPLE MOVING FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. IT CAN NOW BE EXPANDED TO DEVELOP RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE ENTIRE DTS SYSTEM -- SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FUNDING IN AND A WAY FOR VENDORS AND REGIONAL CENTERS TO DEVELOP NEEDED. PROGRAMS AND AND POTENTIALLY INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS. AND THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF RETAINING SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY. AS THEY FACE. MOSTLY FLAT RATES OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS AS WELL AS RISING COSTS THAT ARE OUT OF THEIR CONTROL SUCH AS LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES -- THAT'S OBVIOUSLY ALSO MAKES IT HARD TO GET NEW VENDORS INTO THE SYSTEM. AND THEN FINALLY WE YOU KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE NEED FOR SAFETY NET SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF YOUR TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTIONS THE PANEL OF OUR EXPERTS FROM ILLEGAL ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON. THANK YOU FOR MAKING AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX -- WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY COMPLEX MORE UNDERSTANDABLE JUST THE WAY IT'S LAID OUT -- I WAS JUST WONDERING REALLY QUICKLY AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME TILL YOUR PRESENTATION. MAYBE MS ARGUMENT COULD HAVE ANSWERED IF I HAD KNOWN BUT THE REGIONAL ARE THE ARE BEING. LEFT OPEN AND TRYING TO FIND THE MONTH OVERLOAD -- SIX SIX THE ONES THAT ARE OPEN ON A LIMITED BASIS. ARE THEY LOOKED THE PORTERVILLE IN THE CANYON SPRINGS OF THOSE OUTPATIENTS OR THE FULL TIME SO PORTER AT THIS SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM AT PORTERVILLE IS REALLY DESIGNED FOR CONSUMERS WHO ARE UNDER A COURT ORDER. THEY'VE EITHER BEEN DECLARED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL -- OR HAVE BEEN -- PLACED IN THERE UNDER ANOTHER TYPE OF COURT ORDER. IDEALLY THEY WILL NOT LIVE THERE FOR EVER AND THE DEPARTMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING -- SERVICES AND HOMES TO SORT OF STE THAT PEOPLE DOWN FROM THAT FACILITY AND THEN ULTIMATELY GET THEM PLACED IN THE COMMUNITY. SEEM SIMILARLY CANYON SPRINGS IS NOT MEANT TO BE -- LONG TERM -- RESIDENTIAL SOLUTION IT'S MEANT TO BE MORE OF A TRANSITION AND SORT OF TRAINING -- GROUND FOR THE CONSUMERS WHO LIVE THERE -- AT MOST BETWEEN THE TWO FACILITIES THEY CONSERVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY I'M DDS CONSUMERS AND THERE'S NO PLAN AT THIS POINT TO CLOSE EITHER OF THOSE. ESPECIALLY THE SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS DOES PROVIDE A A SORT OF NEEDED. PLEASE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM MR MEDINA. WHERE'S THE CANYON SPRINGS LOCATION IT'S DOWN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. IN KITTY CATHEDRAL CITY THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR DIAGNOSIS SO THE SYSTEM CUT HER. I REALLY TO APPRECIATE -- YOUR CANDOR WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP LEóN AND THE UNBIASED APPROACH THAT YOU TAKE. AND GIVING US INFORMATION THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED IN AND A DISSEMINATING HOW WE CAN BE MORE HELPFUL SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. YES AND EMPLOYEES NEVER HESITATE IN THE FUTURE WHAT IF THE COMMITTEE HAS QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN HELP WITH ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH. TO REMOVE ON TOUR A THIRD PANEL -- AND THAT'S US UNDER SMITH FROM WHICH IS THE CHAIR OF THE STATE COUNCIL DEVELOPMENTAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. GOOD MORNING THINKING OR HAVING ME. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID I AM SANDERS MET AND I'M CHAIR OF THE STATE COUNCIL FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS SOME OF THIS INFORMATION YOU'VE JUST HEARD. BUT IT BEARS BEING REPEATED I'D AGREE I AM A PARENT OF A THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD NONVERBAL. AUTISTIC YOUNG MAN WHO IS JUST RECENTLY BEEN PUT INTO A POSITION WHERE HE CAN BE INDEPENDENT LIVING WITH ASSISTANCE FROM REGIONAL CENTERS. IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO GET THERE AND I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN EDUCATION SO THIS IS A A TRIP A JOURNEY THAT I'M CONTINUING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUE WITH MY SON TILT LIKES. THE DEMOGRAPHICS FOR CALIFORNIA WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND THIS IS JUST AN OVER THERE. NEARLY FIFTY YEARS AGO CONGRESS ESTABLISHED THE STATE COUNCIL ON EVERY STATE AND TERRITORY DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ASSISTANCE AND BILL OF RIGHTS. TWO THOUSAND AUTHORIZE COUNSEL TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WITH MY DD AND THEIR FAMILIES DESIGNED IT ACCESS SERVICES TO SUPPORT AND SUPPORTS. THE LATTER MEANT ACTS THAT WISH THAT STATE COUNCILS AND CALIFORNIA'S DOUBLE EDGED OVER THIRTY ONE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WITH ID DE THEIR FAMILIES OTHER PARTNERS AND STATE AGENCIES THE STATE COUNT ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES A FIVE YEAR STATE PLAN WHICH I WAS THE CHAIR UP. IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE DD ACT THROUGH THE WORK OF ITS TWELVE REGIONAL OFFICES WE SPENT OUR OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE UNLIKE MOST THE COUNCIL'S. THE PLAN IS DEVELOPED IN STAKEHOLDERS AND PUT ADDRESS SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS EMPLOYMENT HOUSING EDUCATION COMMUNITIES PORTS HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR PERSONS WITH ID DE. WHAT IS THE MISSION THE VISION OF THE STATE COUNCIL OUR MISSION OF THE CITY COUNCIL PROMOTES COUNSEL ADVOCATES PERMITS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ACHIEVE SELF DETERMINATION INDEPENDENCE PRODUCTIVITY INCLUSION AND ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMMUNITY LIFE FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. OUR VISION FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES ARE GUARANTEED THE SAME FULL AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES LIFE LIBERTY AND PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS IS ALL AMERICANS. WHAT AYE DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALIFORNIA WITH THAT THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION IT'S THE FULL POPULATION OF? OVER FORTY MILLION OR SO BUT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND THEM ARE REPRESENTED FROM ITT POPULATIONS AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE NEXT GRAPH CHART. IT SHOWS THAT -- AND PEOPLE WITH SERVED WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND US OBJECTIVE PARCHMENT. WE BEAT IT AND OF THOSE IN THE STATE THERE IT'S ALMOST SIX HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND THAT HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS. WHAT IS THE STATE OF EDUCATION FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH IT DE? TO SEIZE SPECIAL EDUCATION OR RELATED SERVICES UNDER THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT A STUDENT WITH A DISABILITY MASS. BE ELIGIBLE UNDER ONE OF THIRTEEN SPECIFIC CATEGORIES AND IN NEED OF SERVICES THERE IS NO SPECIFIC CATEGORY FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS AGES SIX TO TWENTY ONE SERVED UNDER IDA IS APPROXIMATELY 230-004-0050. NINE OR THREATENED THREE POINT CATEGORY WOULD CONSIDER CONSIDER STUDENTS WITH AN INTELLECTUAL A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. WHAT IS THE EMPLOYMENT STATE? FOR CALIFORNIA AS YOU CAN LOOK AT THE GRAPH ON ON THE BOARD THEIR FORMER TEACHER HERE. IT SHOWS POPULATION HAVE. WHAT WE HAVE THERE'S 80%? AND THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AT PULSE 25%. FOR SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR THAT SIMILAR NUMBERS BUT MUCH LOWER. AND THE SIX THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. SO WHAT IS THE STATE OF HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH IT DE. THAT'S MANY NUMBERS WERE INDIVIDUALS BY LIVING ARRANGEMENTS ARE SO SUPERVISE HOUSING AS YOU CAN SEE IS THAT THE GREEN AREA HIGHLIGHTED. AND ALONE OR WITH THE ROOMMATE WHERE MY SON IS NOW HE HAS A ROOMMATE HE CANNOT EVER LIVE ALONE IT'S 16%. AND FORTUNATELY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MOST THE POPULATION CONTINUES TO LIVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES BUT NOT NECESSARILY BY DESIRING THAT. THE INDIVIDUALS MY SON LIKE I SAID IT TOOK TWO YEARS TO GET THEM IN A PLACEMENT THAT WOULD WORK FOR HIM. DOES ANYONE IS LIVE AT HOME I CAN FIND A VENDOR TO DO SO SO THAT IS A BIG BECAUSE BECAUSE OF HOUSING COSTS. WHAT IS THE STATE HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIA FADED THE PERSON SERVED BY? THE SETTING FOR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN PEOPLE WITH ID DE LIVING IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS WAS OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND SUPPORTED LIVING WITH. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OTHER SMALL RESIDENTS DID READ JUST DENTAL EXCUSE ME GROUPS TWENTY THREE THOUSAND A LITTLE BIT OVER THAT. SO IN THE STATE OF HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIANS THE END TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE AVERAGE AND ANNUAL INCOME OF ITS SINGLE PERSON RECEIVING SSI WAS. NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX ABOUT 22% BELOW THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AN EQUAL TO ONLY 20% OF THE NATIONAL MEDIAN INCOME FOR A ONE PERSON HOUSE [inaudible] THAT'S JUST. NOT SOMETHING WE CAN LIVE ON IT WON'T WORK. IN CALIFORNIA 500-924-0060 SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE RECEIVE SSI THE AVERAGE SSI PAYMENT IS EIGHT HUNDRED GLOBAL NINE DOLLARS THE PERCENTAGE OF S. SITE SS I NEED IT FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IS ABOUT A 138%. OF THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT AND 117% FOR AN OFFICIAL C. APARTMENT WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT INDIVIDUAL HAVE TO BE ALONE AND RECEIVE SERVICES COMING INTO THE HOME TO HELP THEM OUT. SO WHAT ARE THE DISPARITIES IN THE PROCESS OF SERVICES AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE CHART IT'S LISTED BY ETHNICITY SO AMERICAN ON THE AND THROUGH A ASIAN. AFRICAN AMERICAN BLACKS HISPANIC NATIVE HAWAIIAN OR OTHER OTHER ETHNICITIES IN MULTI CULTURAL. SO THE PERCENTAGE OF AFTER OF AMERICAN INDIAN RECEIVING IT SERVICES IS THAT POINT 3%. THERE WAS AN ASIAN IS EIGHT POINT 9%. AFRICAN AMERICAN OR BLACK EIGHT POINT 6%. SPANNING THIRTY NINE POINT 5%. NATIVE HAWAIIAN OR OTHER PACIFIC ISLAND POINT 2%. OTHER ESTIMATES ETHNICITIES OR MULTICULTURAL LEVIN POINT 2% AND WIDER CAUCASIAN THIRTY ONE POINT THAT IS MY PRESENT AGE FOR THE DAY ON THE COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE. A GROUP OF PARENTS AND PARTNERS AS I SAID BEFORE WE ALL HAVE PASSION AS YOU DO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. AND ENERGY ON THIS ISSUE AND WE ARE HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BEEN MY STEP PERCENT SINCE BE ABLE HELPED. MISTER MONNING QUESTIONS OF THE POST. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION PULLED HIM [inaudible] JUST. YOU HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM WHAT. COULD WE BE DOING BETTER WHAT DO WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING OUR ENERGY ON THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WE GET. CHANNEL THAT ENERGY WHERE DO YOU SEE [inaudible] THE LARGEST EFFICIENCY AND THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF HOW WE PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR ME PERSONALLY AS I WAS SAYING I STRUGGLE WITH GETTING VENDORS TO SERVE AND PROVIDE FOR MY SON -- STILL HOUSING HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH THAT SO ALL OF THESE FACTORS EMPLOYMENT THE IF YOU'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY RENT. BUT YOU CAN'T GET EMPLOYED BECAUSE HAVE ISSUES OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU CAN RECEIVE THEN IT'S LIKE A VICIOUS CIRCLE. AND THERE'S LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE A BOMB. LOCATION WHERE EVERYBODY CAN GO AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE YOU NEED THEM. NOT BECAUSE IT FELT A LOT OF PAPERWORK I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE JUST HAPPENED TO ME RECENTLY BECAUSE OF A MIX UP MY SON SERVICES MEDIC CAO AND IN HOME SUPPORT. WE JUST CANCEL. I DID GET A PHONE CALL I GOT A LETTER RESPONDED TO THE LETTER BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY I SIT HERE IS THE CHAIR OF THE STATE COUNCIL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES BUT I WON A WEEK. AND PARENTING JUST RECENTLY NOT KNOWING WHAT I DO IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY SON TOGETHER SEIZURE SOMETHING NO MEDICATION SO IT'S A IT'S A COMBINATION OF ALL THESE FACTORS. BUT FOCUSING ON THE INDIVIDUAL HAS TO BE PERSON CENTER AND S. B. LED BY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS LIKE I SAID MY SON THIRTY SIX FINALLY LIVING ON ITS OWN. HIDDEN WANNA LIVE AT HOME. ALL THESE YEARS BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER OPTION FOR ME. SO GIVING OPTIONS THE BIGGEST THING INTO AND PULLING OUR DOLLARS IN THE DIRECTION OF FAMILIES THAT SERVE THEIR INDIVIDUALS AT HOME MAKING SURE THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF TWO THE FACT THAT THERE AT INDIVIDUALISTS AT HOME DOES NOT MEAN THEY DON'T NEED THE SAME SERVICES. THAT IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE AS WELL. AND MY STAFF PERSON MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE SMART DOCUMENT. NUMBERS AND STATS. NO IT'S A SIMILAR TO WHAT CENTER SAID WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT WHAT ACTIVITIES THE COUNCIL'S GOING TAKE UNDER THIS PAST YEAR IN TERMS OF OUR POLICY WORK. THEORIES WE CONSISTENTLY HEARD FROM ACROSS THE STATE WHERE WE NEED TO WORK ON THE PLAN SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN GET JOBS AND RETAIN THOSE JOBS. AND WE ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS RENT OFFICIALS APARTMENT DISABILITIES IN THE STATE. THOSE THE TWO ISSUES THAT CONSISTENT CAME UP WITH EVERYONE I TALK. TO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THANK FATTEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY FOR YOUR SON AND HANG IN THERE RIGHT NOW YEARS IS A LONG TIME BUT YEAH. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT -- CONTINENTS PROBLEM TERM AND I'VE HEARD FROM FAMILIES THIRD. THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER AND WHOSE AGING OUT OF THE SYSTEM IT TWENTY TWO AND LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES -- AS YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE LEGISLATION TO OF CREATE THE WORKFORCE IMMIGRATION HOW WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO OF LOOKING FORWARD TO A ALSO WORKING TOWARDS THE THE TWENTY TWENTY TO MANDATE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THAT THE CALIFORNIA HAS A PROCESS IN PLACE GOING FORWARD. HON THAT BEING SAID -- YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA. LEAN ON YOU VERY HEAVILY BECAUSE YOU ARE AGAIN EXPERTS IN YOUR FIELD ABOUT -- HOW WE CAN BETTER ADVOCATING ITS THIS? SO MEMORABLE MOMENTS IS SAYING WERE OPEN AND WILLING TO YOU KNOW TO BE THERE IS HERE THE EXPERTS AND AND YOU HAVE TO GUIDE US WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND JUST MY MUCH OF THE LAST FEW YEARS I DOESN'T DOESN'T ENTER. TWENTY ONE AND THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE BUT I HAD TO PUT IT OUT THAT SUMMARY. KNOWN ACTUALLY EATEN AGAIN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW LIFE SKILLS SINCE THE TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD. WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FROM THAT POINT FOR NOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGING OUT OF THE SYSTEM THAT THE FALLING OFF THAT CLIFF IS NOT APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN AND VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY WELL FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU POLICY. THINKING. WE MOVE ON TO OUR UP -- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION REGIONAL CENTERS AMY WESTLING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. MORNING FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR CONVENING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. AND FOR BEGINNING AN IMPORTANT DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD NOT JUST LOOKING AT A SPECIFIC BILL BUT AS A SYSTEM TO PRESERVE THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THANK YOU ALSO TO YOUR STAFF. FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT WENT INTO COORDINATING THIS HEARING. BEFORE I MOVE ON I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON SOMETHING THAT DIRECTOR PARCHMAN SAID THAT. CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM FOR SERVING PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IS DIFFERENT THAT IT. WAS AND AT ITS INCEPTION A MODEL FOR THE NATION. AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF WAYS THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FIRST AND FOREMOST WE HAVE NO WEIGHTLESS FOR ENTRY INTO THE SYSTEM. IN VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY THERE ARE WAIT LISTS [inaudible] AND THEY CAN BE A DECADE OR MORE LONG. SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO EVERY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL IS A SIGNIFICANT THING. ADDITIONALLY IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THERE WAS A COURT DECISION THAT SOLIDIFIED BUT NOT ONLY DO PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO ENTRY INTO THE SYSTEM BUT THEY HAVE A RIGHT. TO NEEDED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT STEM FROM THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. ANOTHER WAY THAT OUR SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT IS THAT THERE IS INTENTIONAL LOCAL CONTROL WHICH IS INTENDED TO ALLOW. AIR EACH AREA OF THE STATE TO DRIVE SERVICE DELIVERY THAT FEELS BEST THAT IS THE BEST CULTURAL FIT FOR THEIR AREA. BUT IT ALSO ENABLES REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE MORE NIMBLE AND AGILE THAN A STATE AGENCY. WE RECOGNIZED EARLY ON IN CALIFORNIA BUT NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL. BUT RATHER. WE IS A SYSTEM NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR OWN LIVES. AND THIS CONCEPT HAS COME TO THE FORWARD. IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECENTLY RECOGNIZING THAT WE NEED. TO PLANNED FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVES WITH THEM. IN A WAY THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT NOT ONLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY BUT ALSO THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PERSON. THOSE THINGS THAT HELP THE PERSON. TO WANT TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND TO WANT TO GREET THE DAY. WE KNOW THAT DEMOGRAPHICS PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN SERVICE DELIVERY. AS DIRECTOR BARGE MEN NOTED AS WELL AS MISS PETTITTE FROM THE LA SHOW. OUR DEMOGRAPHICS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY. AT THE INCEPTION OF OUR SYSTEM FIFTY YEARS AGO. OUR POPULATION WAS 75% WHITE AND AND TODAY WE'RE A RICH TAPESTRY OF VARIOUS ETHNICITIES AND BACKGROUNDS WITH OVER FORTY LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT [inaudible] CULTURAL VALUES. DR DIFFERENT CHOICES. WE KNOW THAT IN SOME CULTURES. THE PREFERENCE IS FOR TO MAINTAIN INDIVIDUALS AT HOME. AND AS MS SMITH SAID WE KNOW THAT. IF THE CHOICE IS TO MAINTAIN YOUR LOVED ONE AT HOME. WE IS A SYSTEM HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO SUPPORT THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND TO SUPPORT THAT FAMILY TO WRAP OURSELVES AROUND THAT FAMILY TO ENABLE THEM. TO MEET THEIR REQUIREMENTS. TO KEEP THEIR LOVED ONE AT HOME. NO MATTER WHAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS. THE ABSOLUTE GOAL MUST BE EQUAL ACCESS TO SERVICES BETTER VALUABLE AND THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT OUR PRICE FROM THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. AS BOTH DIRECTOR BARGE MEN AND MISS PATRICK NOTED. THE SYSTEM IS WORKING. TRY DIFFERENT THINGS TO SEA WATER THOSE THINGS THAT ARE MOST RESPONSIVE TO DIFFERENT CULTURES. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO AS A STATE MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FUND WHATEVER WORKS. AND TO MAKE A LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO FUNDING THOSE THING. AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE. THAT PROGRESS IN THIS AREA TAKES TIME. THAT THERE ARE BARRIERS THERE ARE ISSUES RELATED TO SERVICE DELIVERY SOME OF WHICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH. THE REGIONAL CENTER OR THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDIVIDUAL. SO IT MAY BE THAT IN SOME POPULATIONS. THERE ARE ISSUES AROUND OF MISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT AND THE BELIEF THAT REGIONAL CENTERS ARE GOVERNMENT. PARTICULARLY IN THIS ECONOMIC I'M SORRY IN THIS POLITICAL CULTURE. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO MEET PEOPLE'S NEEDS AND WE NEED TO MEET THEM WHERE THERE OUT RATHER THAN TRY TO PUT THEM INTO A BOX. DIRECTOR BARGE MEN NOTED THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM WAS INITIALLY DEVELOPED. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO INSTITUTIONAL CARE. IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WE HAD OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND STATE RUN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AS WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY THAT POPULATION IS DOWN TO UNDER. FIVE HUNDRED AND IMPORTANT TURNING POINT IN THE DEPOPULATION OF STATE INSTITUTIONS WAS THAT WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE CAR FELT DECISION IN THE EARLY NINETIES. WHICH LED TO THE STATE COMMITTING TO NOT ONLY THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OUT OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. BUT ALSO THE APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE SERVICES. FOR INSTANCE SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES FAMILY HOME AGENCIES WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL MOVES INTO. THE HOME OF ANOTHER FAMILY WHO SUPPORTS NOT ALONE WHO SUPPORTS NO MORE THAN TWO INDIVIDUALS. HOMES FOR MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN [inaudible] SUPPLEMENTAL STAFFING TO ENABLE REGIONAL CENTERS TO OFFER ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS TO KEEP PEOPLE IN [inaudible] RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS. AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PLAN WHICH IS PROVIDED A FUNDING STRUCTURE TO ENABLE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEEDED RESOURCES SINCE THAT TIME. WHILE THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OUT OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IS IMPRESSIVE IN THE AGGREGATE WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S DONE ONE SINGLE PERSON AT A TIME. THE ABSOLUTE GOAL [inaudible] IS. TO INSURER BUT EACH PERSON HAS EVERYTHING THEY NEED THEIR FIRST DAY IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT THAT MOVEMENT ISN'T JUST. MOVING THEM FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER BUT IT'S USED AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE THEIR LIVES THAT IS THE GOAL IT'S NOT THE SHUDDERING OF STATE. RUN FACILITIES IT IS THE ENHANCING OF INDIVIDUAL LIVES. IN TERMS OF HOUSING. OUR POPULATION IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC SET ASIDES FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THERE'S NO SPECIAL FUNDING STREAM AT THIS TIME. IN PART BECAUSE MOST OF OUR POPULATION DOESN'T KNOW ONE SHELTERED. IF AN INDIVIDUAL APPROACHES A REGIONAL CENTER AND REQUESTS SHELTER. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO MOVE INTO SETTINGS. BUT WE KNOW [inaudible] THAT. THERE ARE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS AND DIFFERENT INTERESTS IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR TODAY. IT MAYBE THAT LESS PEOPLE ARE SEEKING GROUP LIVING AND MORE ARE SEEKING INDEPENDENT LIVING. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REALLY SUPPORTS THIS. IF WE THINK BACK TO JUST FIFTY YEARS AGO. THE IDEA OF COMMUNITY THE IDEA OF PROVIDING ANY OF THE SERVICES OUTSIDE OF A DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WAS NOVEL AND YOU NEED. AND WE HAVE EVOLVED SO THAT NOW WE EXPECT AND THE PEOPLE WE SUPPORT EXPECT TO BE FULLY INCLUDED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THAT MEANS. REGULAR HOUSING FOR MANY OF THEM. CALIFORNIA HAS. THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN THE NATION WHEN. KIT COST OF LIVING IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. HIGHEST INTERESTINGLY EN LA COUNTY IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. REGIONAL COST DIFFERENCES MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN NOTED EARLIER. ANY NO COUNTY IN THE STATE IS HOUSING AFFORDABLE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO RENT EVEN A STUDIO APARTMENT. WHO RELIES ON SSI? DIRECTOR PARCHMENT EARLIER NOTED THAT. ONE OF THE KEY PROMISES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE LONG PROMISED PEOPLE. IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY OF THEIR CHOOSING. BUT HOW DO WE DO THAT. IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEDICATED POOL OF DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE REAL HOUSING NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY MISS MATH FROM THE STATE COUNCIL NOTED THAT. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE LIVES AT HOME DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S ALWAYS THEIR CHOICE SO WE REALLY HAVE TO DRILL DOWN AND FIGURE OUT. WHO IS NEEDING HOUSING AND FOR WHOM [inaudible] IS THE ON AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING. IN THEIR WAY IN TERMS OF THEM ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THOSE SERVICES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE HOUSING ACCESS FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION ARE OVERTAXED. IN MANY COUNTIES [inaudible] HOUSING VOUCHERS THE WAITING LIST FOR THOSE OPEN. ONCE A DECADE. AND THE INFLUX OF PEOPLE WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THOSE VOUCHERS. IT'S SO SIGNIFICANT BUT THEY DO A LOT OF REACH SOMETIMES JUST TO GET ON THE WAITING LIST. SO YOU MAY NOT AFTER WAITING A DECADE EVEN GET ON THE WAITING LIST FOR A HOUSING VOUCHER. WE NEED A MORE DEDICATED SOLUTION FOR OUR POPULATION. IN TERMS OF THE SAFETY NET. WE KNOW THAT. AS MISS PETTITTE POINTED OUT. BUT CERTAIN POPULATIONS BUT MAKEUP ORDERED RICH DEMOGRAPHICS TODAY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE TO SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY THOSE WITH AUTISM AS WELL AS THOSE WHO HAVE A GOOD AND ADDITIONAL PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES. TODAY IN THE COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEM OF 11% OF PEOPLE HAVE A DUAL DIAGNOSIS [inaudible] 18%. RECEIVE A BEHAVIORAL MEDICAID MEDICATION OF SOME SORT 20% HAVE A SPECIAL HEALTH REQUIREMENT. AND 5% OUR TECHNOLOGY DEPENDENT. SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THERE WAS A MORATORIUM PUT ON DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PLACEMENTS EXCEPT BRING VERY LIMITED SITUATIONS. THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS CAN NO LONGER SERVICE THE BACKSTOP WHEN SOMEONE IS STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN COMMUNITY PLACEMENT. A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE. TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO MEET THESE NEEDS. SPECIFICALLY A CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR CHANGES IN BEHAVIORAL STABILITY. RECOGNIZING THAT. WHAT SOMEONE NEEDS? TO RIP TO MAINTAIN THEIR BEHAVIORAL STABILITY TODAY MAY LOOK DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY REQUIRE A YEAR FROM NOW. AND THAT OUR SYSTEM HAS TO BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO THOSE INCREASES AS WELL AS DECREASES IN SUPPORT MEANS. ALL OF THESE POPULATIONS REQUIRE MORE REGIONAL CENTER STAFF TIME FOR SERVICE COORDINATION RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT MONITORING. AND JUST BRIEFLY BEFORE A WRAP UP I WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT. THE FUNDING CHALLENGES THAT THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM HAS TODAY. MISS PATRICK NOTED THAT OUR ROOM CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE WITH ITS MEDIAN RATES. IS INEQUITABLE UNSUSTAINABLE AND RIGID. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT IMPACT DOES THIS HAVE ON REAL PEOPLE ON THOSE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY THE SYSTEM TODAY. WE KNOW THAT THE DIRECT WORKS THAT'S DONE WITH INDIVIDUALS IS OFTEN PAID AT MINIMUM WAGE. AND THAT THOSE JOBS ARE REALLY COMPLEX ESPECIALLY AS WE EXPECT THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCESS THE ROOT COMMUNITY AT LARGE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER NOTED A COUPLE OF TIMES THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSISTENCY IN STAFFING. AND IF WE AS A SYSTEM CAN'T PAY MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE CONSISTENCY IS INCREDIBLY HARD TO MAINTAIN OR ACHIEVE. WE NEED TO IDENTIFY A WAY TO NOT ONLY PAY MORE ROBUST WAGES FOR THESE POSITIONS. BUT TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS A CAREER TRACK. BUT PEOPLE WILL STAY AND SEE PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND FIND. A LIFE FULL OF PASSION AND SUPPORTING THIS POPULATION. THE RATE STUDY. AS WE'VE HEARD IS -- THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT ARE DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE NEED A COMMITMENT TO FUND WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS COME FORWARD AS WAS NOTED EARLIER A STUDY ON ITS OWN. IS NICE. BUT THERE HAS TO BE A COMMITMENT. TO TAKE THAT NEXT STEP ADDITIONALLY. REGIONAL CENTER FUNDING. FORMULA FOR FUNDING FORMULAS FOR ITS STAFFING. ARE ALSO VERY ANTIQUATED WITH SOME OF THE FIXED COSTS WALKED IN AT RATES THAT WERE SET IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF FUNDING AS MISS PATRICK NOTED. WOULD BE TO LOOK AT IS THERE A WAY TO PULL IN SOME OF THE FUNDING FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AS THE CLUB'S. TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP THOSE RESOURCES IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND TO STABILIZE OUR SYSTEM NOT ONLY FOR NOW BUT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS [inaudible] IN CLOSING. WE'VE SEEN MANY CHANGES OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IN OUR SERVICE SYSTEM. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL. THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION REGIONAL CENTERS SPENDERS FAMILY IS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SUPPORTED. HAVE A COMMITMENT TO MEETING EACH INDIVIDUAL'S UNIQUE NEEDS. BUT WE ONLY HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO IT. THANK YOU AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THIS DRAWING OF A QUESTIONS OF OUR PANELISTS [inaudible] SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE -- STAFFING LEVELS OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS UP AS A WHOLE Y. KNOW EACH ONE HAS ITS OWN DYNAMIC -- IS THERE A GENERAL -- NUMBER THE YOU HAVE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY. SO WHAT KIND OF STAFFING LEVELS YOU EITHER DEFICIENT ARE IN AND WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO DO CUT ICE I SEE THAT THE THE THE AREA THAT SERVICE LEVEL ARE AREAS ARE VERY LARGE. AND SO WHAT WOULD. TWENTY ONE CENTERS THROUGHOUT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES -- SO ZERO SERVICE LEVEL THAT YOU'RE AT NOW THAT -- PICTURE YOU CAN STATE. PROBABLY THE GREATEST INDICATOR THE MOST VISIBLE ONE IS CASELOAD RATIOS THERE'S A STATUTORY -- COMMITMENT TO CASELOAD RATIOS THAT FOR SOME POPULATIONS IS ONE TO SIXTY TWO ONE SERVICE COORDINATOR FOR EVERY SIXTY TO INDIVIDUAL SUPPORTED. AND FOR OTHERS IS -- ONE TO SIXTY SIX DEPENDING ON FEDERAL FUNDING STREAMS. AND BUT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MOVED FROM DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS MOST RECENTLY IT'S ONE TO FORTY FIVE TODAY THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE IS ABOUT -- ONE TO SEVENTY FOUR WHICH IF YOU LOOK AT THE JOB OF A SERVICE COORDINATOR. THE JOB HAS BECOME MORE COMPLEX IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE FEDERAL DOLLARS FLOWING INTO THE SYSTEM AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES IN TENTS OF DOCUMENTATION. IT USED TO BE THAT SERVICE COORDINATORS GOT TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME WITH PEOPLE IN THEIR FAMILIES GETTING TO KNOW THEM GETTING TO KNOW THEIR UNIQUE DYNAMICS. AND THE JOBS HAVE BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ADMINISTRATIVE AT SINCE THAT TIME. AT THE SAME TIME THE CASELOAD RATIOS HAVE RISEN. I THINK AT LAST COUNT THE SERVICE SYSTEM WAS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATOR SHORT -- WHICH MAKES A DIFFERENCE IT IS. THOSE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON EACH CASE LOAD REALLY DO PULL AWAY FROM THAT TIME THAT COULD BE SPENT. TO DO MORE THOUGHTFUL [inaudible] PLANNING [inaudible] AND TIME SPENT IN MORE PROACTIVE ACTIVITY. SEEING THAT YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OF SERVICE. THE CUSTOMER SERVICES THEN. BEEN -- ACUTELY -- COMPROMISED. I'M ALWAYS IMPRESSED BY THE RESILIENCY OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND BY THE INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE SERVICE COORDINATORS. BUT PEOPLE WOULD DO BETTER. IF THEY HAD. LOWER CASELOAD RATIOS. THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND THE FACT THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TIME FOR PLANNING. AND TALKING AND GETTING TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER. AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES AS WELL AS FINDING UNIQUE WAYS TO MAIM EACH INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS. HAS THE REGIONAL CENTERS TRACKED A RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES ONCE HAVE BEEN HIGHER WAS AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THEY'LL THEY THEY STAY. HOME HIS YOU SAY THERE'S BEEN NO. A PROBLEM WITH IT KEPING EMPLOYEES. YES I BELIEVE AS PART OF THE A. B. X. TWO ONE THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT TO TRACK NOT LONG JAVADI NECESSARILY BUT TURNOVER RATES I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME TODAY BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO GET THAT TO YOU. APPRECIATE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE NUMBERS THAT WE WOULD HELP US -- JUST BASED ON OF AS YOU TALK A CAREER CHOICE -- MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE AN ABILITY TO WANT TO WORK IN THIS COMPLEX WORLD. WHO ARE TRAINED TO WORK IN THIS WORLD AND -- THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY NEED [inaudible] A THEY HAVE A SKILL SET THAT IS VALUABLE TO THIS CONSUMER SO. LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS IT ALSO. BUT I DO APPRECIATE -- AND AND APPRECIATE THE REGIONAL CENTERS FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND AND UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE GIVE THEM I CAN ON MY COMMITMENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK TOWARDS [inaudible] OF A REVENUE SOURCE LIKE WE DID WITH MESA -- SO YOU KNOW NOT NECESSARILY ATTACKS BUT WE DID MAKE A COMMITTED EFFORT FOR REVENUE WITH THE MILLIONAIRES TAX AND FOR THE MENTAL [inaudible] SO. SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BECAUSE WE CAN'T ALWAYS COULD CONTINUE. TO ACCESS THE GENERAL FUND WITH THE CYCLE THAT IT GOES THROUGH IN ANY CONSISTENT FUNDING. SO LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO EXPLORING ALL POTENTIAL SOURCES OF FUNDING -- ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ENHANCE THE SYSTEM IS GREATLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH.

A GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. ABOUT HOW PROGRAMS LIKE FEATURES EXPLORE PEOPLE FIND JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITY [inaudible] I'M. DISABLED PEOPLE HAVE HAD MANY STRUGGLES TO REACH OUR GOALS EVERY DAY. MY BIGGEST GOAL WAS TO FIND A STEADY JOB SO I COULD TAKE CARE OF MY OWN FAMILY. I WAS TRYING TO FIND A JOB WITH NO LUCK THROUGH MY OWN JOB SEARCHING. I JOIN MANY JOB CLUBS THROUGHOUT THE SACRAMENTO REGION AND HOPES TO CONTINUE MY MOTIVATION KEEPING TO LOOK FOR WORK. WHEN I SPOKE WITH MY DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION COUNSELOR THEY MENTIONED TO ME ABOUT AN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM THAT WAS OFFERED THROUGH THE D. O. R.? I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO BEGIN TO CHANGE MY FUTURE. UPON WORKING TOWARDS GETTING AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION I WAS ALSO WORKING WITH FUTURES EXPLORED. I'VE HAD TO WORK WITH SOME OF THEIR STAFF BEFORE ON OTHER ASSIGNMENTS AND THEY KNOW HOW PASSIONATE I AM ABOUT WORKING HARD SETTING GOALS AND ASKING FOR HELP WHEN THEY NEED IT. I HOPE THAT MY STORY WILL TOUCH MANY PEOPLE IN THE HOPES THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO REACH TOWARDS THE SKY. AND NEVER GIVE UP. THANK YOU KAREN MCCOY. IF I COULD JUST ADD A COUPLE THINGS WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY IN THE CAPACITY THAT I DO. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GO AND JUST MEET SOME FANTASTIC PEOPLE. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GO NOT ONLY WORK A STEADY JOB BUT TO BE ABLE TO GO AND PROVIDE A WAY FOR THEM TO GO AND INTERACT WITH EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY. OUR PROGRAMS INCLUDE PEOPLE THAT GO AND WORK IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY OR PEOPLE LIKE ALEX TO WORKING GENERAL CLERICAL. AND THEIR BROADBAND PEOPLE AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT DESERVE JOBS [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'M SO THE M.. INTERNSHIP PROGRAM THAT KIRA TALKED ABOUT AND ALSO THAT POLITICS WORKS THROUGH -- AT EDTA IS AS A RESULT OF S. B. SIX FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS PASSED IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO THAT PILOT STARTED LAST YEAR WE HAVE -- SIX INTERNS WORKING IN VARIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS -- WE'VE HAD INTERNS AND CAL AND PARTNER OF REHABILITATION AND PARTNER GENERAL SERVICES. WE'VE HAD TWO HIRES SO FAR OUT OF THAT -- INTERNSHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS FABULOUS -- BOTH OF THEM ARE WITH DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. AND AND SO WE HOPE AND WE SEE THAT AS A REALLY GREAT PATHWAYS FOR PEOPLE TO OBTAIN. NOT ONLY EXPERIENCE THAT HELPS THEM BUT HOPEFULLY ALSO STATE EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS A HUGE GOAL FOR A LOT OF THE POPULATION THAT WE WORK WITH THE CITY. STATE EMPLOYMENT AS KIND OF LIKE A DREAM JOB. AND IT'S BEEN -- UP UNTIL NOW REALLY HARD TO GET. YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR IF YOU HAVE WELL FOR EVERYONE BUT ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. SO THAT'S A REALLY GREAT PROGRAM AND THAT'S A DIRECT RESULT OF LEGISLATIVE ACTION. AND SO WILL ALSO ASKED ME TO TALK ABOUT THE STAFFING SHORTAGE ON I HAVE AS WELL SAID I'VE WORKED IN THE FIELD ON FOR FOURTEEN YEARS PRIMARILY AND SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT. AND AND I SEE STAFFING SHORTAGE AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS AND DEFINITELY THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I AM CURRENTLY. IN THE PROGRAMS THAT I OVERSEE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE -- OVER FORTY PEOPLE ON A WAIT LIST WHO WANT JOB SEEKING SUPPORT -- AND WE'D JUST CANNOT HIRE STAFF TO SERVE THOSE PEOPLE. SO THAT MEANS THAT THE WANT TO GET A JOB BUT THEY'RE WAITING FOR SOMETIMES MORE THAN SIX MONTHS BEFORE WE HAD STAFFING AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH THEM. AND THE STAFFING SHORTAGE. STEMS FROM TWO THINGS AND THEY ARE RELATED. AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT OUR REIMBURSEMENT RATES DON'T ALLOW US TO PAY PEOPLE A LIVABLE PROFESSIONAL WAY EACH. BANDS AND THE OTHER ONE IS THAT DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS ARE NOT SEEN AS PROFESSIONALS THAT -- THEY'RE NOT EVEN LISTED ON THE BUREAU OF LABEL LABOR STATISTICS AS A CAREER CHOICE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE JOB DUTIES OF A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT. AND THEN YOU LEFT OUT THE JOB DUTIES OF A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL. THEY MATCH UP LINE FOR LINE AND THEN THE DUTIES OF A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL GO ON EVEN FURTHER THAN A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS DUTIES. A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT IN CALIFORNIA STARTS AT ABOUT SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STARTS AT BETWEEN ELEVEN AND THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE. IS THAT CERTIFICATION. CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS ARE SEEN AS A CAREER CHOICE IT'S A PROFESSION IT'S RECOGNIZED AS A PROFESSIONAL FIELD TO GO INTO AND RECOGNIZED AS A LEGITIMATE CAREER SOURCE I MEAN CAREER TWICE [inaudible] AND DIRECTOR BARGE MEN DISCUSSED THE INCREASE IN THE POPULATION IN THIS FIELD IN THE UPCOMING YEAR. AND SHE AND OTHERS DISCUSS THE VARIOUS SERVICE NEEDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN THIS FIELD AND THAT WILL BE. COMING IN THE FEW. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS IN MEETING THE SYSTEMS CURRENT AND FUTURE DEMANDS IS SECOND ONLY TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. THERE WITHOUT -- WELL TRAINED WELL PAID DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS THERE IS NO SERVICES AND THERE IS NOT A SYSTEM WITHOUT THEM. TOOL THANKFULLY I'M WILL CENTER AGAIN DISORDERED TO FOLLOW UP I DID PROVIDE FOR THE COMMITTEES FOR A ROUGH OUTLINE OF EMPLOYMENT VARIOUS CATEGORIES AND THINGS THAT ARE IN THERE. SOME ACTIONS THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN TO BEEN VERY POSITIVE S. B. SIX FORTY FOUR WAS. ONE THE IMPLEMENTATION THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AND THE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT INCENTIVES WAS GREAT. OUR CHALLENGE IS BEEN IN IMPLEMENTATION -- LEGISLATION SOMETIMES PUTS IN LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF DETAILS. THAT MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT ON THE GROUND FOR US ACTUALLY DO THAT. YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE HAIR COLOR WOULD SEE I COLOR WHO IT WAS THEIR SHOE SIZE WHEN REALITY HOW TO LOOK AT JOBS. AND SO HELPING US RELIEVE SOME OF THAT WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT -- TO DO THAT AND AS LINSEY POINTED OUT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN STAFF. IS A HUGE SINGS THE SUPPORT EMPLOYMENT RATE IS THE SAME WHETHER YOU'RE IN FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER SAN DIEGO OR THE BAY AREA -- WHICH MEANS THERE'S VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN COST OF LIVING TO HOW DO YOU ATTRACTED MAINTAIN STAFF. THE OTHER ONE IS WE NEED THE TOOLS AND AND THE CHAIRS OPPOSITE LED -- AND WORK WITH US ON TRYING TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM MORE. SEGREGATED SITUATIONS TO MORE COMMUNITY BASED WE GOT CLOSE THE FINISH LINE BUT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR SO I THINK. WE NEED THOSE EFFORTS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY AND AS LINDSAY POINTED OUT. IT AS WE MOVE MORE MOURNED COMPLIANCE WITH BEING MORE MORE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TO HAVE STAFF WHO ARE VERY COMPETENT WERE ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON MY VERY TRUSTS WERE THERE IN RESPECTFUL OF OUR FOLKS. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LINE OF SIGHT SUPERVISION. IN A LARGE YOU KNOW DAY PROGRAM OR WORK ACTIVITY CENTER OR OTHER CONCRETE SETTING. THERE'S A LOT OF LINE OF SIGHT SUPERVISION. BUT WHEN YOU TAKE TWO OR THREE ONE TWO OR THREE FOLKS AND THE COMMUNITY. YOU'RE THEN TRUST IN THEM RIGHT NOW AS I OFTEN SAY I'VE SEVEN HER FOLKS WHO WERE SUPPORTING RIGHT NOW. IN PROBABLY SEVEN COUNTIES WITH TWO HUNDRED PLUS STAFF. AND I'M HOPING OF THE GOES WELL TODAY. YOU KNOW ITS REALLY DEPEND ON THOSE FOLKS THAT MAKE THOSE LIVES MEAN PHONE THAT'S REALLY THE OPTION OF OUR EXERCISE HOW TO MAKE THEIR LIVES MEANINGFUL. EMPLOYMENT IS ONE HUGE KIVA THAT IF YOU LOOK AT STATISTICS. WE HAVE SEVENTY THOUSAND FOLKS CLUSTERING DAY SERVICES WE HAVE FIVE THOUSAND OUR LAST TOUR IN SUPPORT EMPLOYMENT INDIVIDUAL PLACEMENT. THAT'S A HUGE SHIP THAT WE HAVE FOR HOW TO DO SO WHAT THINGS WERE OPEN COMMITTEE CAN LOOK AT IT IS TO TAKE THAT ON AND GLAD FOR THEM TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE MUCH MORE THAN I A STRONG. WELL MR CENTER YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD A LONG RELATIONSHIP AND AND I'VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED YOUR CANDOR. AND YOUR ENTHUSIASM -- I WILL SAY THAT -- AND YOUR EXPERTISE BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN A GUIDING STAR FOR ME. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INTEGRATED WORK WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STUFF THAT? WE CAN WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE -- HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION -- KNOWING THAT DAYS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE SUPPORT. OTHER COMMUNITY WANTS TO BE SUPPORTED INTO THE WORKFORCE -- BUT COULD YOU SHARE WITH ME AND THE TWO HUNDRED PLUS OF EMPLOYEES THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRETENSION ALSO WHEN YOU KNOW AS FAR AS GOING. ABLE TO PAY. FROM ELEVEN TO THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR HOW LONG. DO YOUR EMPLOYEES TEND TO LAST. WE HAVE IT'S A RANGE OUR TURNOVER RATE DEPEND HOW YOU LOOK AT ITS ROUGHLY 23% A YEAR -- IF YOU GO INTO LESSEN THE YEAR IT'S CLOSER TO FIFTY OR 55% -- IF SOMEONE COMES IN REALLY BUYS INTO WHAT WE DO GETS A VELOCITY ENJOYS THAT AS ONE TO WORK TWO MAYBE THREE OTHER JOBS -- THEY'LL STAY AND SO WE HAVE FOLKS ABOUT. 40% OF OUR FOLKS HAVE BEEN WAS FOR LONGER THAN THREE YEARS SO IT'S IS PRO THE BIGGEST FOUNTAIN IT VARIES -- RADICALLY BASED ON LOCATION BASED ON WHAT THE OTHER LOCAL ECONOMY BEEN. THE BAY AREA WE WERE COMPETING WITH GOOGLE TWITTER SIGN ALL THAT AND SO IT'S THAT THE CHOICES OUT THERE IS HOW YOU MAKE IT MEANINGFUL FOR FOLKS BILL TO GO DO IT. SO. AS A MATTER OF FACT. THROUGH SPECIAL OLYMPIC SITE STARTED PROGRAM A MILE CAPITAL WE'VE HAD IT FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS A PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR IT INTERNS WAS SPECIAL NEEDS -- AND IT'S BEEN AN ATHLETE. WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE HOW WE LEARN FROM THEM HOW WE CAN BETTER ADVOCATE. AND IN THE WORKFORCE SPOKE. MOODY'S OVER THERE IN THE CORNER WON'T RAISE YOUR HAND RUDY. WHO'S WITH THE SPECIAL EFFECTS -- WELL WHO IS ARE ESPEIALLY MIX IN TURN IN IS A JOY TO WORK WITH AND I WON AND HERE TODAY SO. HE CAN GIVE ME FEEDBACK ALSO OF THIS AFTERNOON. ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO ACTUALLY -- BE A BETTER SUPPORT SYSTEM GOING FORWARD -- BUT WE WANT YOU GUYS TO TO UNDERSTAND THAT WOULD YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS PANEL HOW IT'S BEEN ENLIGHTENING IN AGAIN -- YOU ARE CHAMPIONS KEEP GOING APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR SAFETY NET AND CONSUMERS IN CRISIS A EVELYN. ABU HAMZA HOUSE PASSING. I I BY BUTCHERED EVERY TIME ABSOLUTELY HELLO SHARES WITH WHEELS ALWAYS GOOD MORNING. UP MY NAME IS AB ONE AB HASEN I'M THE SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. I WAS ASKED TO TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT DRC. AND THE WORK THAT WE DO AND THEN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SAFETY NET. AND CRISIS SERVICES. SO LET ME START BY SAYING THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. BEFORE THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AS I SAID I'VE EVELYN ABA HUFFING AND SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. DRC IS THE EVEN FEE MANDATED BY FEDERAL LAW TO PROTECT. AND ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS. CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING THOSE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. OUR OFFICE OF CLIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCACY OWES VERY. ALSO PROVIDES ADVOCACY SERVICES TO CONSUMERS OF THE REGIONAL CENTER. THROUGH A CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THE R. C. PROVIDES LEGAL ANOTHER ADVOCACY ASSISTANCE TO APPROXIMATELY. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN INCLUDING HER LEVIN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE INDIVIDUALS. WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WE PROVIDE BOTH SYSTEMIC ADVOCACY AND INDIVIDUAL ADVOCACY SERVICES [inaudible] IN ADDITION. THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES WE ACHIEVED. OUR WORK THIS YEAR RESULTANT OUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN SERVICES AND BENEFITS. I CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES. OUR REGIONAL CENTER. PLANTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES HAVE THE STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY TO REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN RESTRICTIVE ARRANGEMENTS. AND IT'S THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WHO MOST OFTEN EXPERIENCE BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES AS A RESULT OF CRISIS. I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF LEARNED DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM I THINK YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF THAT TODAY SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST TALK MORE ABOUT THE SAFETY NET. AND SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA HOUSE. AS A RESULT OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICE TASK FORCE CONVENED BY THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THERE'S A CLEAR CONSENSUS ABOUT HOW THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SYSTEM CAN EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CRISIS. THE INDIVIDUALS FACE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE REPORT IDENTIFIES THE GOALS OF THE DD CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM TO BE. ENSURING CONSUMER SAFETY. WHICH INCLUDES PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS FROM HARM AND ABUSE. AND PROVIDING APPROPRIATE CRISIS INTERVENTION AND RESPONSE. WELL OF A WIDE VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES CAN RESULT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ENDING UP IN CRISIS. SUCH AS THE TERMINATION OF A CURRENT LIVING ARRANGEMENT OR SUPPORT SERVICES. AND INCREASING BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES OR PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY. THE TASK FORCE REPORT IDENTIFIED AND EFFECTIVE CRISIS INTERVENTION SYSTEM MUST INCLUDE. PREVENTING A CRISIS FROM OCCURRING INCLUDING. MAINTAINING INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR HOMES AND DEVELOPING MODELS OF SUPPORT SUPPORT. TO PREVENT AN INDIVIDUAL FROM* BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OR NEEDING MORE RESTRICTIVE LEVEL OF CARE. THE DEPARTMENTS MAY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SAFETY THAT REPORT WHICH OF MISS BARTMAN REFER TO ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. WHO ARE HAVING A DEVELOPMENT WHO ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED AND ARE HAVING A CRISIS? CURRENTLY THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE CERTAIN MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES. INSTITUTES OF MENTAL DISEASE. OR STATE OPERATED ACUTE CRISIS CENTERS. IN ADDITION TO THESE INDIVIDUALS DRC KNOWS OF HUNDREDS MORE CONSUMERS WHO NEED CRISIS SERVICES. BUT HAVE NOT YET REACHED THE CRITERIA THAT MAKES THEM ELIGIBLE -- IN IT ED BUT MAY REACH THAT THAT CRITERIA LEVEL IF APPROPRIATE SERVICES ARE NOT PROVIDED. SO HOW DO WE ASSIST CONSTITUENTS AND OTHERS THAT REACH OUT AND CRISIS. INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO LOOKS WHO EXPERIENCE OR ARE AT RISK OF CRISIS SHOULD RECEIVE CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES FROM THE LOCAL REGIONAL CENTER. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE OF CLIENTS RIGHT ADVOCACY MAY BE ABLE TO ASSIST IMAGE ASSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THE SERVICES. AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS. ARE APPROPRIATELY ASSESSED. ONE STRATEGY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR COMMUNITY PLACEMENT IS TO ASK THE REGIONAL CENTER. TO REFER THEM FOR AN INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT PURSUANT TO WELFARE AN INSTITUTION CODE. FORTY FOUR EIGHTEEN POINT. SEVEN THIS EVALUATION CAREFULLY EXAMINES THE BEHAVIORS AND SERVICES NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THE PERSON IN THE COMMUNITY. THE GOAL SHOULD BE KEEP THE INDIVIDUAL LIVING IN THEIR HOME OR THE RESIDENTIAL LIVING ARRANGEMENT. WITH ADDITIONAL SERVICES. I'M TO ADDRESS THEIR BEHAVIOR CHALLENGES. THE NASE THE NEAREST REACH REGIONAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. CONDUCT THESE ASSESSMENTS. INDIVIDUALS WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES THE DEPARTMENT AS ALREADY NOTED HAS CREATED THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STAR. WHICH ARE THE STABILIZATION TRAINING ASSISTANCE AND REGENERATION HOMES AND THE STAR CRISIS A TH ASSESSMENT RESPONSE TEAM THE CAST. AND WHILE THE SERVICES INCLUDE WELL TRAINED STAFF THEY ARE LOCATED A LONG DISTANCE FROM THE CONSUMERS AND CANNOT BE ALWAYS THE INITIAL FIRST RESPONDER AND A CRISIS. AND WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TWO COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES THAT ARE RUNNING -- THE AVAILABILITY OF BETSY IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ENHANCE BEHAVIORAL HOMES AGAIN THESE ARE TWENTY FOUR HOUR RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED HOWEVER CURRENTLY THEY ARE PRIMARILY PRIMARILY FILLED. WITH DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER MOVIES UP MOVERS. SO THE NEED FOR INCREASED FUNDING IN THE COMMUNITY -- FOR SAFETY NET SERVICES WE DO APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS ON IN IMPLEMENTING THE SAFETY NET PLAN INCLUDING DEVELOPING THE NEW MODELS OF CARE HOWEVER. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT GAPS THAT REMAIN. AND THE INDIVIDUALS OF AND THAT FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS THE CRISIS THAT SYSTEM LOOKS MORE LIKE A PATCHWORK OF SERVICES. OPERATED BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES RATHER THAN A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM THAT WILL WILL MEET THE DS TASKFORCE GOALS. AND FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE WEEK. OR IN SOME REGIONAL CENTER CATCHMENT AREAS THERE ARE VERY FEW LOCAL CRISIS RESPONSE SERVICES AND THAT WHILE THE DHEA DDS MOBILE CRISIS TEAM CAN HELP IDENTIFY INTERVENTIONS. THEY CANNOT QUICKLY RESPOND IN CASES OF EMERGENCIES AND ALL AREAS. IN ADDITION WE KNOW THAT IN SOME COUNTIES MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN COUNTY DESIGNATED MENTAL HEALTH. UTILITIES DECLINED TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. BECAUSE OF AN INCOMPLETE SYSTEM. THESE INDIVIDUALS OFTEN. END UP IN PLACES OF LIKE LOCKED INSTITUTES OF MENTAL DISEASE WHICH HAVE A VERY HIGH USAGE OF SECLUSION. AND RESTRAINT. BUT WE ARE AWARE THAT SOME REGIONAL CENTERS WHO DO NOT HAVE OTHER OPTIONS ARE USING WHAT'S KNOWN AS HOTEL THERAPY. WHICH PLACES AN INDIVIDUAL IN CRISIS IN A HOTEL WITH TO THE ONE STAFFING AND TWENTY OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT ADDITIONAL SAFETY NET CAPACITY -- IT BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE ADDITIONAL SAFETY NET COMMIT CAPACITY AT THE CURRENT -- CAPACITY IS INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEED. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT INCREASED SAFETY NET FUNDING IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL CRISIS CAPACITY. SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL. CHALLENGES CAN BE SUPPORTED IN THEIR CURRENT LIVING ARRANGEMENT WITH -- IN ORDER TO PIN UP PREVENT PLACEMENT AND RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS LIKE INSTITUTES FOR MENTAL DISEASE OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES. THUS WE SUGGEST WHAT BONDS NEED TO BE TARGETED FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SERVICES. MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES IN EACH REGIONAL CENTER CATCHMENT AREA AGAIN WE TALKED ABOUT THE SERVICES THERE. THEY ARE NOW AVAILABLE BUT THEY ARE VERY HARD TO ACCESS -- AND IN EACH REGIONAL CENTER AREA. COMPREHENSIVE INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT PLANNING AND TAILORED SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS. TO PROVIDE A CONTINUITY OF TREATMENT -- TREATMENT SUPPORTS INTENSIVE MONITORING. CASE MANAGEMENT AND I THINK MISS WAS LIKE TALK ABOUT THIS REDUCING CASE A SERVICE CASELOAD RUSHED RATIOS PART THIS POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS. DEVELOPMENT OF INTENSIVE OF WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH CO OCCURRING DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND MENTAL HEALTH. NEEDS THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE DUAL DIAGNOSES. THE YOU SERVICES WILL ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO SUCCESSFULLY PREVENT ADMISSION INTO HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS LIKE INSTITUTES OF MENTAL DISEASE WE CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF LACK OF MOVEMENT FROM INDIVIDUALS. OUT OF I'M. INSTITUTES A MENTAL DISEASE THEY OFTEN STAY THERE BEYOND THE STATUTORY TIMELINE OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. SO I'M TOO OFTEN OF REGIONAL CENTERS DO NOT DEVELOP PLANS TO MOVE THESE INDIVIDUALS OUT OF THESE TYPES OF SETTINGS. AND FINALLY INCREASING THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF COMMUTING THE CRISIS LIVING ARRANGEMENTS -- AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THIS POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH NEEDS AND AGAIN WE BUT WE NEED TO SEE MORE. OF COMMUNITY LIVING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEM -- AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER IT. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT AND WE ALL HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SAFETY NET HIS IMPERATIVE. WITH THE S. POPULATION BEING ABLE TO BE -- SERVED INTO IT TO AN EXTENT WHERE. IF THERE IS. A NEED HERE IT IS INSTANTANEOUS -- BECAUSE OF THE FRAGILE STATE THAT SOME FOLKS GET IN IN ANY GIVEN THE BEHAVIORAL -- ASPECT THEY CAN GET IN MORE TROUBLE XIN NOT THIRTIES TO CATCH THEM -- SO. I LOOK FORWARD. TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I WORKING WITH YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE WORKING WITH YOU WHERE WE CAN. LOOK AT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ON THAT SAFETY NET ALSO GOING FORWARD AND HELIPORT YOUR EXPERTISE. WE'VE PROVIDED SOME DETAILED MATERIALS IN YOUR PACKET STATE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO US AT DRC FOR ANY KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE -- DEATHLY WE'RE GONNA BE USING YOU AS A REFERENCE POINT FOR A LOT OF A LOT OF THINGS WERE -- AND THE COMMUNICATION CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE RECESS UNTIL THE NEXT WEBSITE CYCLE I SAY THE THE WHOLE POINT I THINK. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE HEAR THE COMMUNITY. AND I PASSED -- OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ASSEMBLY. FOR AT LEAST ONE BILL TO BE CARRIED PER ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOR THIS COMMUNITY AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT SADIE BILLS. ARE GOING FORWARD WITH A COMMITMENT TO CATCHING UP AND MAKING SURE THAT WE MAKE A COMPREHENSIVE. APPROACH WHERE WE CAN CONNECT THE DOTS. AND HENDO SHOW THAT. IT'S TIME TO CATCH UP. SO REALLY APPRECIATE WORKAWAY AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE HAPPY TO BE HERE THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO IS MOVE ON TO OUR UP PUBLIC COMMENT -- IN THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC WHO LIKE TO MAKE. BUT A TO TWO MINUTE -- COMMENT -- EACH. HOW COME ON UP TO THE MIKE?

BUT IT BECAME A PROFESSION FOR ME AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD I'VE HAD A LOT OF LUCKY BREAKS. THAT -- IN I CAN AFFORD TO LIVE WHERE. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO OUR CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES. THE MOST RECENT CHALLENGE IN THIS SORT OF WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE TO QUOTE WILL SANFORD OF OUR RATE SETTING METHOD UP METHODOLOGY IS HALF DAY BILLING. WHICH WAS RE IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR. WE DO A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE TASK TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW. FOR FOR PEOPLE FOR THREE DAYS WE HAVE A HALF DAY OF BILLING. FOR OTHER AGENCIES IT MIGHT BE MORE. BUT THE HARD THING IS WE CAN'T DO HALF DAY PAYMENT FOR OUR STAFF. SO THEY COME IN IN THE MORNING AND THEY EXPECT WORK A FULL DAY. AND THEY DO EVEN IF OUR CLIENTS. YOU KNOW ONLY SPEND 65% OF THEIR DAY THERE AND WE ONLY GET HALF THE MONEY -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CHALLENGES LIKE THIS LIKE THE HOLIDAYS? THE HOLIDAYS THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT YEAR. YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN OTHER KINDS OF BUSINESSES SAY. WELL THEN WHY ARE YOU STILL IN BUSINESS. HOW ARE YOU STILL IN BUSINESS? AND I WOULD SAY. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF OUR BUILDINGS. CUTTING BACK ON FRONTLINE SUPERVISION [inaudible] LOW WAGES. COMPROMISE BENEFITS. FOR OUR STAFF. AND BASICALLY ROBBING THE PROVERBIAL PETER TO PAY PAUL PAUL TO PAY PETER YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE. HOW MY GET I'M STILL STRUGGLING WITH MY BUDGET THIS YEAR? AND THE REASON I'VE HAD I BEEN IN THE BLACK THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS. I BASICALLY HAVE A 20% STAFFING DEFICIT. AND THAT'S HELPED ME. GET THROUGH THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND NOT EVERYBODY IS STILL IN BUSINESS A DAY PROGRAM IN MARIN COUNTY IS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS THIS MONTH. I THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION WE SAY WELL HOW ARE YOU STILL IN BUSINESS IS WHY. WHY DO I DO THIS? WHY DID I WORK FOR LOW WAGES MYSELF? TO GET TO WHERE I AM TODAY. IS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE. I LOVE. THE PEOPLE SOME OF THEM LIKE MY OWN FAMILY I'VE KNOWN SINCE I STARTED IN THE FIELD. AND I KNOW OTHER PROVIDERS IN THIS ROOM. THAT HAVE JOBS. WHERE THEY FEEL JOY EVERYDAY AND NOT EVERYONE HAS THAT? AND NOT EVERYONE HOUSE THE RICH RELATIONSHIPS AT WORK THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DEVELOP FOR THE CLIENTS. SO WHY WERE STILL IN BUSINESS IN SPITE OF THE CHALLENGES IS. BECAUSE WE LOVE THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AND I HELP I GET TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THEM FOR ABOUT TWENTY MORE YEARS. THINK IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VISION IMMIGRANT REPRESENT PLEASE. THANK YOU SANDY SOLID A ON THE COORDINATOR OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COUNCIL IT'S A PROGRAM AND POLICY PLANNING UNIT IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. I BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO LEFT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WANNA TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE WORK FORCE ISSUE AND THE SAFETY NET ISSUE. ON JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE SNAPSHOT ON AND I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY LEGISLATORS LEFT IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVEN'T HEARD ME SAY MY DOG WALKERS MAKE MORE MONEY. THAN DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS CURRENTLY I PAY TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS FOR HALF AN HOUR DAHLE GLOCK [inaudible] ON IF THAT DOESN'T RESONATE WITH YOU THEN I WILL SAY THAT MIGHT CLERK ON A COUNTY CLERK SALARY MAKES MORE MONEY THAN HAS JOB COACH [inaudible] ON WE WILL APPRECIATE THAT THE RATE STUDY WE APPRECIATE THAT LA OVER REPORT BUT BOTTOM LINE IS OUR SYSTEM IS BASED ON A MINIMUM WAGE MODEL. AND INTEL THAT CHANGES WEEK PAT GET. THE WORKERS THAT WE NEED I HAVE SOME DATA THAT UP WHEN I HEARD THIS I THOUGHT IT WAS FASCINATING THIS IS FROM ALEGRIA COMMUNITY LIVING ALEGRIA HAS EIGHT HOMES. AND TWENTY SIX OF RESIDENTS AND THEIR HOMES ON AT THE RESIDENTS ARE FORMER I'VE FROM. AGNES AND CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SO IN ONE FISCAL YEAR WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING FOR STAFF. THEY REVIEWED THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY RESUMES THEY DID TWENTY HUNDRED PLUS CALLS 270-0 AND TWO POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. FORTY NINE CANDIDATES WERE NO SHOWS THIRTY THREE CANDIDATES INTERVIEWED AND NOT CHOSEN. THIRTY SEVEN CANDIDATES INTERVIEWED AND HIRED ELEVEN TERMINATED FOURTEEN OTHER STAFF TERMINATE. SO THAT'S ONE YEAR OF AN AGENCY THAT SERVES TWENTY SIX RESIDENTS AND HAS EIGHT HOMES SO THAT AGAIN IS A SNAPSHOT. JUST THEN VERY QUICKLY ABOUT THE SAFETY NET SERVICES -- THE IT FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY OUR RESIDENTS WILL UP RECEIVE LITTLE OR NO BENEFIT FROM MEDICAL SERVICES OUTSIDE THE COUNTY. CURRENTLY ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS IF NOT THE HIGHEST ONE OF THE HIGHEST FIFTY ONE FIFTY RATES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF MY BOARD MEMBER SIGN. HE REACHED TRANSITION AGE HE BECAME ACTIVATED HE BECAME DANGEROUS SHE CALLED ON A NINE ONE ONE ONE EVENING THEY TOOK HIM TO USUALLY IT'S THEY TAKEN TO JOHN GEORGE THAT GET BOUNCED OUT OF JOHN GEORGE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. THIS TIME THEY TAKEN TO THE FREMONT KAISER <u>&lt;c.green&gt; ARE HE&lt;/c&gt;</u> SPENT A WEEK IN THE ER HE SPENT THREE WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL. BECAUSE ALAMEDA COUNTY AT THAT TIME. CRISIS HOME AND THERE WERE NO BIDS OF THE FOUR BEDS IN THAT HOME FINALLY HE WAS ABLE TO GO. WE NEED THOSE SERVICES TO THANK YOU. RESEARCH MEMORY REPRESENT COULD NOT DAN HOKA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LOST CONFIDENCE IN CENTRAL CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WE SERVE. A APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED TWENTY INDIVIDUALS IN ADULT DAY PROGRAMS AT ADULT RESIDENTIAL SUPPORTED LIVING IN THE INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES ARM. I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT. WHILE THE RATE STUDY IS COMING OUT THAT WE NEED TO ALSO EXAMINE IS THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE ARE ON THE VENDOR CODES. AND THE LIMITATIONS THAT IT PLACES ON VENDORS ARE IN THAT IN THE SERVICES THAT THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE. SO AS WE MOVE TOWARD SELF DETERMINATION IN INDIVIDUALS ARE CHOOSING THE SERVICES THAT THEY WANT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER IS THAT VENDORS NOW NEED TO BECOME VERY FLEXIBLE. IN CUSTOMIZING THE SERVICES TO THE INDIVIDUAL SO IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT IF YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE YOU'RE PROVIDING AN ADULT DAY PROGRAM SERVICES WHICH IS VERY DEFINED. AND SO FORTH BUT THE INDIVIDUAL WANTS TO ALSO DO OTHER THINGS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS WELL THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THAT. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE BAD SERVICE CUTS AND I AGREE WITH EVERYBODY HERE REGARDING THE STAFFING OUR DAY PROGRAM WERE DOWN 33% ON OUR STAFF RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE THE PROGRAMS. FOR PEOPLE TO ATTEND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE STAFF AND WE CAN'T STOP THEM. THE OTHER DAY I HAD ACTUALLY PROVIDE INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES TO ONE OF MY STAFF BECAUSE SHE CAME TO ME INSERTED TOLD ME. THAT SHE LOST HER HOUSING. AND HAD TO PROVIDE TO HER THE COACHING IN THE MENTORING AND THE RESOURCES THAT I WOULD TO ANY OF OUR THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE TO HELP. HER FIND HOUSING FOR HERSELF. THE IT IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE. CAN NOW AND AGAIN. 33% DOWN IN MY DAY PROGRAM. 25% DOWN IN SUPPORTED LIVING I'VE HAD A 100% TURNOVER IN MY EYELIDS PROGRAM IN THE LAST YEAR. THIS IS THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUT MY NAME IS MARTY EMOTO I'M A FAMILY MEMBER MY OLDER SISTER HAD DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ALSO WORKED IN THE SYSTEM. FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO IS A DIRECT CARE WORKER AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA. A CD CAN'T TELL FROM DISPLACING YOUR CREE ACTION NETWORK -- FORTY FORTY FIVE YEARS GOES DIRECT CARE WORKER AND HAD A HOLD TWO DIFFERENT JOBS TO SUPPORT MY FAMILY. AND I GUESS A LOT OF THINGS HAVE CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM SINCE THEN BUT ONE OF THINGS THAT DIDN'T CHANGE IS THAT. IS THAT PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS OR FIND WAYS TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY IN TRYING. TO TO HELP AND SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FIRST WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER AND YOU MISTER MULLIN AND IN THIS TO HAVE -- AND NOT THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE UP FOR DOING THIS HEARING BUT I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENT. THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHICH IS THAT YOUR COMMITTED FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS OR MAYBE LONGER IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO STAY LONGER. I DON'T NOW YOU NEVER KNOW -- TWO CAN TO REALLY DO AND DRY DRILL DOWN ON THE ISSUES ARE IMPACT YOUR COMMUNITY WITH ONGOING HEARINGS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE OF YOU CAN TELL FROM THIS ROOM. A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T MAKE UP TO SACRAMENTO AND I REALLY PREACH EFFECT THAT YOU YOU'RE COMMITTED IN DOING THAT. NUMBER TWO I'M JUST WANT TO SAY YOU WERE ASKING FOR SOME STEPS WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO IN THE LEGISLATURE. MAKE SURE THAT WERE INCLUDED OUR COMMUNITIES INCLUDED IN OTHER POLICY INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE BROADER HOUSING PACKAGE. YOU ARE THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT THERE'LL BE OTHER HOUSING BILLS THAT WE SHOULD BE INCLUDED IS ISSUES OF HIGHER EDUCATION ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OUR WORKFORCE OR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES NEED TO BE MENTIONED IN THOSE THINGS. EMERGENCY RESPONSE SUCH AS THE FIRES I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WERE MENTION WE NEED TO BE MENTIONED BECAUSE THAT DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITY -- NUMBER THREE REGARDING HOUSING AND I WON'TREPEAT EVERYTHING THAT OF THE OTHERS PEOPLE SET. BUT WHEN YOU THINK OF HOUSING PLEASE THINK ALSO. OF OUR WORKFORCE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER JUST MENTIONED IN A SITUATION THAT IS NOT UNCOMMON. OUR WORKFORCE IS PAID VERY LOW THEY CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING MANY OF THE WORKFORCE ARE MEDI CAL. AND THEY NEED ASSISTANCE IN ADDITION OUR FAMILIES WITH PEACH YOUNG CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES NEED HOUSING AND THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED IN ALL THOSE NUMBERS THAT YOU JUST HEARD. THIRD REPRIEVE SHAPE THE EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT. REGARDING THE RATE STUDY IN THE OTHER INITIATIVES -- BUT WANT TO MAKE AND I APPLAUD THE FACT THAT YOU'RE INCLUDING A FAMILY SURVEY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE INCLUDED THE FAMILIES ARE INCLUDED IN HELPING TO DO. TO CONSTRUCT THAT SURVEY BUT WE ALSO WANT URGED DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE. TO INCLUDE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN THAT SURVEY. AND ALSO WHEN YOU SURVEY THE FAMILY DEVELOPMENT OF ABILITIES. YOUR SURVEY NOT JUST THE SERVICES THEY GET BUT THE SERVICES THEY AREN'T GETTING AND THE SERVICES THAT YOU DESPERATELY NEED. AND THE OTHER. ISSUE IS WHERE WE EVEN TALKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT IS. PUSHING WITH FOCUS GROUPS. ACROSS THE STATE TO TALK ABOUT THE RATES. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES AND PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS ANOTHER WAY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO FIX OUR SYSTEM. AND MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE LASTLY JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN OVER AND OVER WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT SAFETY NET ISSUES BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT RESPONDING TO CRISIS MY SISTER WAS IN CRISIS. FOURTEEN YEARS AGO AND PRIOR TO THAT SHE WAS IN CONSTANT CRISIS MY FAMILY HAD NOWHERE TO GO AND THAT JUSTICE THING THAT AS SANDRA SMITH MENTION.

ARM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT AS EMPLOYMENT FOR OUR ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES DISEASE XXI US WITH THE SETTING UP INDEPENDENCE FOR ALL OF THE GUYS THAT I'VE SERVICE AND HELP GET JOBS. IT'S JUST A REALLY OF REWARDING FOR MYSELF. TO SEE THAT WITH THEM AND THEIR SUCCESS BOTH THE ONE THING IS THAT SOME OF WHEN I DESCRIBE MY JOB IS SOME FRIENDS AND FAMILY SALE THAT'S SO GREAT THAT'S WONDERFUL. OUTCOMES MORE HOW CAN WE WORK CREE GUYS. NOW I SAY. WELL YOU KNOW MONEY IS KIND AN ISSUE RIGHT THERE. THAT KIND OF TURNS ME OFF TO OUR PROFESSION WHICH I BELIEVE THAT I'M A PART OF RIGHT NOW.
