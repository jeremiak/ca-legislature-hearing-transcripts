00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:51.028
AND AFTER SHE LOST ALL OF HER

00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:52.463
MONEY SHE WAS STILL ACCEPTING

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.233
CALLS STILL THINKING THAT SHE

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:57.001
WAS GOING TO BE THE BENEFICIARY.

00:33:57.068 --> 00:33:58.836

IN ALL CORNERS A CALIFORNIA THE

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:27.685
PEOPLE PASSED THE ADULT USE OF

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:29.820
MARIJUANA ACT OF TWO THOUSAND

00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:32.156

RECREATIONAL USE PERIOD.

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:41.498
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE AND

00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:42.733
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.002
THIS BILL AND SEE EXACTLY THE

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:46.570
SAME BILL WE HAD LAST YEAR.

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:47.938
THAT WAS HELD IN COMMITTEE IN

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.206
THE ASSEMBLY.

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:51.575
IS TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:53.711
BANKING ISSUE YOU'RE LITERALLY

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:55.746
ACCORDING TO SOME MEMBERS OF

00:41:55.813 --> 00:41:57.514
THIS HOUSE WHO ARE SERVE THOSE

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:59.383
AREAS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BURIED

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.684
IN BARRELS.

00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:02.853
THERE ARE STORY AFTER STORY WITH

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.488
THIS PUBLIC SAFETY RISK WHERE

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:05.890
PEOPLE ARE GETTING HELD UP AT

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:07.858
GUNPOINT OR SHOT TO TRY TO GRAB

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:09.793
CASH THERE'S SO MUCH CASH IN THE

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.561
SYSTEM.

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:13.063
BECAUSE UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW WE

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.531
HAVE SCARED THESE ARE MARIJUANA

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:16.267
IS DEEMED TO BE A SCHEDULE ONE

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:17.234
DRUG WHERE THE PEOPLE IN

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:19.203
CALIFORNIA SAY IT'S LEGAL AND SO

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.504
THEY WON'T BANK IT.

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:22.239
SO WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO HERE

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:24.141
WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.845
HOUSES.

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:28.379
IS TO COME UP WITH IN THE

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:29.179
INTERIM.

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:30.114
A PROCESS WHERE WE COME UP WITH

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.182
A LIMITED CHARTER BANK THAT HAS

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:33.484
LIMITED PURPOSES THERE ARE

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.486
CURRENTLY NINE HUNDRED AND

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:36.353
TWENTY EMPTY BRANCHES IN

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.788
CALIFORNIA THAT COULD EASILY BE

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:40.157
RENTED FROM FRESNO LOS ANGELES.

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.393
OXNARD VENTURA RIVERSIDE SANTA

EUREKA AND BEYOND THE COULD

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:48.499
EASILY BE RENTED SO THE IDEA IS

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:50.267
TO CREATE A LIMITED CHARTER BANK

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:52.736
THE JEWS FOR PURPOSES. ONE TO

00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:54.338
ALLOW VENDORS TO CREATE CHECKS

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:56.473
TO PAY STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.276
FEES TO TO PAY VENDORS FOR GOODS

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:00.544

INSTRUMENTS WITH IN CALIFORNIA

00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:09.153
WE'VE DONE THIS A WAY TO CREATE

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:10.621
A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM.

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:12.823
THAT WILL HAVE ITS OWN INSURANCE

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.792
AND WON'T INNER INTEGRATE WITH

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:16.961
THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE

00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:19.463
FEDERAL SYSTEM OUTSIDE OF HOW

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.665
THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WORKS.

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:24.034
THIS IS AS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:25.536
UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.771
CHANGES ITS POLICY I BELIEVE WE

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:29.306
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO STEP

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:30.908

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:35.746
INCREASE THE ABILITY TO GAIN

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:37.114
TAXES AND THE LIKE.

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:37.881
WHICH IS BEEN SOMEWHAT

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:39.249
CHALLENGING AS WE'VE SEEN

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:21.392
WE CAN BAND.

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:22.026
RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING'S GOING TO

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:23.127
BE DONE IN CASH.

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:24.061
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A CASH

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:25.929
BUSINESS IT BRINGS IN BILLIONS

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:27.498
OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR.

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:28.265
WHILE I'M SURE WE HAVE SOME

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:30.134
HONEST VENDORS OUT THERE THAT

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.769
WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE

00:44:31.835 --> 00:44:33.670
PAYING THEIR TAXES.

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:34.838
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THE STATE OF

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:36.040
CALIFORNIA IS LOSING NOT

00:44:36.106 --> 00:44:37.741
MILLIONS BUT PROBABLY HUNDREDS

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:39.543
OF MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS OF

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.079
DOLLARS A YEAR IN TAX REVENUE --

00:44:42.146 --> 00:44:44.915
BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CANNOT --

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:47.451
WRITE A CHECK -- TO THE STATE OF

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.852
CALIFORNIA THEY GOT TO COME IN

00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:50.988
WITH WILL BERYL'S TO KERRY AND

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:52.689
ALL THE CASH AND IF THEY'RE

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.691
HONEST HONEST VENDORS AND WANTED.

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:55.859
TO ALLOW THE STATE TO RECEIVE

00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:57.094
THE TAX MONEY.

00:44:57.161 --> 00:44:58.896
BUT IN ADDITION TO HAVING WILL

00:44:58.962 --> 00:45:00.397
BARRELS TO CARRY THEIR CASH AND

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:01.865
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE FEAR THAT

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.100
THEY MUST HAVE.

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:05.669
IN WALKING AND DRIVING AROUND

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:07.504
WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OR

00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:09.373
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.442
IN THEIR CARS OR TRUCKS -- TO

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:14.178
SAFELY GET THE MONEY TO THE

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:15.245
APPROPRIATE.

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:15.846
ENTITIES TO PAY TAXES ARE TO

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:17.314
THEIR EMPLOYEES TO PAY THEIR

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:18.215
WAGES.

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:19.583
SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.485
MEASURE UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.187

WHICH WE NOW WE'RE SAYING WE

LIBERTARIAN LEANING PERSON.

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:10.360

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:01.477
THE ENTIRE STATE.

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:03.179
AND EVEN THOUGH INDIVIDUALS --

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.781
DESIRE TO LIVE WHEREVER THEY

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:07.250
CHOOSE I DON'T THINK EVERYONE

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:08.718
CAN CONTEMPLATE THE ON

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:10.053
CONTEMPLATED.

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:11.554
I DON'T THINK WE UNDERSTOOD THE

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:13.723
SEVERITY OF THE THE FORCE FIRES

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:14.858
ON THE WILDFIRES THAT WOULD IN

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.259
GULF AS OF THE LAST NUMBER OF

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.293
YEARS.

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.395
SO I BELIEVE THIS IS A STEP

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:22.866
FORWARD I THINK IT'S MERITORIOUS

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:23.800
AND CERTAINLY WORTH.

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:25.668
LOOKING AFTER -- THE FOLKS THAT

00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:27.604
LIVE THERE GOD WE COULD ALSO

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:29.305
HAVE A SITUATION WHERE -- THERE

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:31.207
COULD BE A MASS EXODUS IF WE

00:58:31.274 --> 00:58:33.243
DON'T MAKE CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:34.344
AND PUT THEM INTO PLACE SO I

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.112
APPLIED -- THE AUTHOR FOR

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.014
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WOOD

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:40.717
BEES WILL BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY.

00:58:40.783 --> 00:58:41.718
THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS ANY

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:43.720
FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:46.089
SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER

00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:49.359
GALGIANI MAKE CLOTHES -- YES.

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:51.427
ONE AND THE COST IS BETWEEN

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:52.629
FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:54.397
DOLLARS AND WE ARE NOT DICTATING

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:56.900
SPECIFICS TO CAL FIRE BUT RATHER

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.668
ALLOWING FOR THE FLEXIBILITY SO

00:58:58.735 --> 00:59:00.470
THAT THEY CAN COME UP WITH THE

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:01.938
PROGRAM THAT MAKES MOST SENSE.

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.606
I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:05.642
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED INTO --

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:07.644
FIRESTONE'S THAT AT ONE TIME

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.746
WERE NOT WHAT THEY ARE TODAY

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:12.081
BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:59:12.148 --> 00:59:13.383
ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:15.318
KNOW BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:17.020
NEVER PUT A PRICE ON LIFE.

00:59:17.086 --> 00:59:19.322
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:21.691
THINGS THAT DIDN'T GO AS THEY

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:22.926
SHOULD HAVE GONE DURING THESE

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:24.294
HORROR FLICK FIRES THAT HAVE

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.229
OCCURRED BUT WE DO KNOW THAT

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:28.765
WITH A SIREN WHEN IT GOES OFF IT

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:30.366
ALERTS PEOPLE THAT THERE IS

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:32.335
SOMETHING THAT'S WRONG AND THAT

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:33.403
THEY SHOULD PAY ATTENTION.

00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:34.704
SO IF THEY'RE SLEEPING AND

00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:35.939
SOMETHING HAPPENS AT TWO IN THE

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:38.007
MORNING THEY WOULD BE AWAKENED

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.209
BY A SIREN THERE ARE COMMUNITIES

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:43.179
IN THIS STATE WHERE TWENTY FIVE

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:44.480
THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A KIND OF

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:45.982
MONEY TO THEM IF THEY'RE A VERY

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:47.517
VERY SMALL COMMUNITY.

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:48.851
AND WHILE THEY MIGHT WANT TO

00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:51.187
TAKE THIS LIFESAVING MEASURE UP

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:52.822
FRONT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:59:52.889 --> 00:59:54.457
FINANCES TO DO SO RIGHT AWAY

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:56.059
THEY'RE PUTTING THEMSELVES AT

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:56.993
RISK.

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.128
I BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY MODEST

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:02.432
MEASURE AND AGAIN WE GIVE THE

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.434
FLEXIBILITY TO CAL FIRE TO PUT

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.903
INTO PLACE WHAT WORKS BEST AND

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.471
WE DON'T DICTATE THE EXACT

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:12.809
TECHNOLOGY BUT RATHER.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.610
A SIREN SO THAT.

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:15.311
THOSE WHO ARE IN DANGER ARE

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:16.245

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:56.172
IMPORTANT MINIMUM STANDARD -- WE

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:58.374
NEED TO GO BEYOND -- THE BILL

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:01.310

IT'S QUITE BASIC.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.427
THE BILL PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:21.164

DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT SETTINGS

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:33.042
ARE DIFFERENT AND SO THE BILL

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:35.044
DOES NOT MICROMANAGE HOW THESE

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.180
PRIVATE SPACES ARE PROVIDED

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:39.081

DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:09.078
ITEM DEBATE OR DISCUSSION WILL

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:12.582
START WITH THE SENATOR LEYVA IN

SAN FRANCISCO FOR HIS.

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:25.127
STEADFAST SUPPORT OF THIS ITS

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.762
REALLY SHOCKING WHEN YOU THINK

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:29.332
YOU KNOW ERR A WOMAN HAS A CHILD

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:30.833
SHE WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.368
AND BREAST FEED THAT CHILD.

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:33.869
SHE CAN'T TAKE SIX MONTHS OFF

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.538
BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:36.772
SIX MONTHS PAID LEAVE.

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:38.841
SO ALL WE'RE ASKING EMPLOYERS TO

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:41.143
DO IS MAKE SURE THERE'S A SPACE

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.112
SO THAT THE WOMAN CAN EXPRESS

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:45.848
FOR MILK AND FEED HER CHILD.

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.283
OVER THE YEARS I'VE SEEN WOMEN

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.352
IN CLOSETS I'VE SEEN WOMEN IN

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:52.388
THE BATHROOM TRYING TO EXPRESS

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.389
THEIR MILK.

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:55.958
AND IT'S JUST SHOCKING THAT IN

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:56.559
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HAVE

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:57.660
NOT DONE A BETTER JOB OF

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.395
ACCOMMODATING WOMEN WHO ARE

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:02.298
LITERALLY RAISING OUR FUTURE SO

THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER AND I

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:06.035

BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.848
RELATIONS BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:20.349
THE LAW FOR THEM TO DO THAT.

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:22.118
IT ISREQUIRED BY EMPLOYERS TO

MANY OTHER EMPLOYERS DO.

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:33.029

PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:50.746
WILL CREATE ANOTHER AVENUE OF

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:52.648
OPENING FOR TRIAL LAWYERS TO

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:54.183
COME IN AND SAY THEY'RE FOR THE

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.518
INDIVIDUAL THAT'S BEEN DENIED

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:57.086
THE LACTATION STATION BUT THE

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:57.853
ONLY THING THAT REALLY

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.654
INTERESTED IN.

01:05:58.721 --> 01:05:59.989
OUR THEIR WEIGHT STATEMENTS

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.557
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE IN

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:02.992
CORRECT THING ON THEIR WEIGHT

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.460

A COMMA A DASH OR A DATE.

01:06:06.962 --> 01:06:09.131
THEY WILL HAVE ALMOST --

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:10.566
MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.501
DOLLARS OF FINES AND NOT ALMOST

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:13.536
THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:14.704
DOLLARS OF FINES BECAUSE THEY AT

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:16.038
IT VERY QUICKLY.

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.106
THE OTHER THING THAT THIS BILL

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:18.741
DOES NOT DO IS IT'S NOT NARROWLY

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:21.010
DESIGNED FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:22.578
WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS BILL.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:23.412
I WAS ACTUALLY AT ONE OF MY

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.014
CLIENTS SITES WHICH IS A WELDING

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.782
FABRICATION FACILITY NOT

01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:28.551
NECESSARILY A WOMAN STILL BUT

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:29.652
WOMEN ARE GETTING INTO THAT

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:30.553
INDUSTRY.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.221
BUT OTHER THE THREE HUNDRED AND

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:33.522
TWENTY TWO EMPLOYEES THAT ARE IN%

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.291
THAT FACILITY ONLY TWO WERE

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:36.726
WOMEN AND THEY OPERATE IN THE

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.861
OFFICE AND ONE IS A PAINTER AND

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:40.162
INDUSTRIAL PAINTER.

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:41.997
AND TO REQUIRE BECAUSE OF THE

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:43.766
SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THAT FACILITY

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.267
FIVE OR SIX LACTATION STATIONS

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.969
BASED ON THIS BILL WOULD BE

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:48.571
COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL FOR AN

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:49.472
EMPLOYER.

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:51.107
SO I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR TO

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:53.809
CONSIDER MAKING AMENDMENTS FOR A

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:58.414
SPECIFIC EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYERS

01:06:58.481 --> 01:06:59.448
THAT.

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:00.082
I DON'T SEE TRADITIONALLY DON'T

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:00.716
EMPLOY WOMEN BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:01.417
WOMEN ARE GAINFULLY BEING

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:02.618
EMPLOYED IN MANY MANY INDUSTRIES.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:03.986
BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.254
AN EXCEPTION BASED ON SQUARE

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.590
FOOTAGE -- JUST BECAUSE THE

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.557
SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE FACILITY

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:11.026
THAT THAT MAY NOT EMPLOYEE THAT

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:12.962
NUMBER OF WOMEN THE OTHER THING

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:15.364
IS -- IN THIS BILL LIKE I SAID

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:16.665
WHEN I ADDRESS THE POCKET ISSUE

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:18.200
THERE'S ALSO THE LITIGATION

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:19.468
PORTION OF THIS BILL WHICH IS

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:21.837
EXTREMELY HARMFUL TO EMPLOYERS

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.172
AND ALL WHO WANT TO DO IS BE. TO

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.007
CREATE A JOB AGAIN I THINK

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:26.208
EMPLOYERS SHOULD PROVIDE A

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:28.210
LACTATION STATION FOR WOMEN WHO

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:29.645
NEED TO HAVE BREAST FEEDING THEY

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.113
NEED TO BE QUIET IT NEEDS TO

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.148
HAVE A LOCKED DOOR.

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:33.315
IT NEEDS TO BE A PLACE WHERE

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:34.717
THEY CAN LACTATE APPROPRIATELY

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.485
WE JUST RE CONVERTED ONE OF OUR

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.754
OFFICES BUT AS SO FAR RECLINER

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.423
IN THEIR AT TV IF SHE WANTED TO

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.291
WATCH TV BECAUSE WE HAD. THREE

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:43.692
WOMEN IN OUR OFFICE IT WAS LIKE

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:44.994
TELL THEM TO QUIT DRINKING THE

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.362
WATER RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE.

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:48.297
EVERYBODY WAS HAVING BABIES

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:49.265
WHICH IS GOOD.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.734
AND ANYWAY SO I AT WE COULD BE

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:53.102
CONVERTED IN OFFICE AND WE MADE

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:54.570
IT VERY ACCOMMODATING AND I

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.172
THINK EMPLOYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.072
ENOUGH TO DO THAT.

01:07:57.139 --> 01:07:58.841
AGAIN THERE IS ALREADY A

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.409
LEGISLATION IN PLACE IN THE LAW

MARK'S TURN AND MARK IT UP WHEN

02:02:13.059 --> 02:02:14.260
HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT.

02:02:14.326 --> 02:02:15.995
SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT

02:02:16.062 --> 02:02:17.563
NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED AND WHY

02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:19.065
DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE

02:02:19.131 --> 02:02:20.232
GETTING TO BE SO EXPENSIVE AND

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:21.834
UNSUSTAINABLE.

02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:22.702
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE

02:02:22.768 --> 02:02:24.603
BROUGHT UP WAS THE PRESUMPTIVE'S

02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:26.172
HOW MANY PRESUMPTIVE'S THEY WERE

02:02:26.238 --> 02:02:27.506
FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:02:27.573 --> 02:02:28.908
OFFICIALS.

02:02:28.974 --> 02:02:30.876
AND HOW IT WAS CREATING SUCH

02:02:30.943 --> 02:02:32.578
HIGH DISABILITY COSTS ARE JUST

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:34.647
BECAUSE THIS WAS ANOTHER AREA

02:02:34.714 --> 02:02:36.916
THAT CAN BE ABUSED SO COLLEAGUES.

02:02:36.982 --> 02:02:38.818
BRING THAT OVER TO THE WORKERS

02:02:38.884 --> 02:02:40.786
COMP ARENA I THINK WE'VE GOT TO

02:02:40.853 --> 02:02:42.455
BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT WE CREATE

02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:44.590
AS A PRESUMPTIVE WORD NOTHING IS

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:45.825
DONE OTHER THAN SAYING BUT YOU

02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:46.625

YOU GET TO GET THIS BENEFIT SO I

02:02:50.196 --> 02:02:50.996
I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:51.931
WORK CAN BE REDUCED

02:02:51.997 --> 02:02:53.165
PRESUMPTIVE'S NOT WHERE WE CAN

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:54.100

DECADES EDUCATORS HAVE SEARCHED

02:10:59.218 --> 02:11:01.153
FOR A WAY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:03.355

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:21.206
HARD TO REPLICATE.

02:11:21.273 --> 02:11:23.742
WELL IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

02:11:23.809 --> 02:11:26.178
AFTER LOOKING AT THREE DECADES

02:11:26.245 --> 02:11:27.879
THREE DECADES OF RESEARCH THE

02:11:27.946 --> 02:11:29.514
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS

02:11:30.716 --> 02:11:31.783
CONTROL.

02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:33.752
RECOMMENDED THAT HIGH SCHOOL AND

02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:34.319
MIDDLE SCHOOL START TIME BE

02:11:34.386 --> 02:11:35.087
MOVED [inaudible]

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.788
DAY.

02:11:36.855 --> 02:11:37.723
THIRTY AND OVER FOUR HUNDRED

02:11:37.789 --> 02:11:38.290
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE

02:11:38.357 --> 02:11:40.993
COUNTRY FROM EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC.

02:11:41.059 --> 02:11:42.160
CHOSE TO FOLLOW THAT

02:11:42.227 --> 02:11:43.128
RECOMMENDATION OF THE

02:11:43.195 --> 02:11:44.730
PEDIATRICIANS.

02:11:44.796 --> 02:11:47.099
AND THE INDEPENDENT THINKERS AT

02:11:47.165 --> 02:11:48.734
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL.

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:50.335
AND THREE DECADES OF RESEARCH

02:11:50.402 --> 02:11:50.936
AND THEY MOVE THEIR START TIME

02:11:51.003 --> 02:11:52.437
LATER.

02:11:52.504 --> 02:11:53.372
AND A REMARKABLE THING STARTED

02:11:53.438 --> 02:11:55.307
TO HAPPEN.

02:11:55.374 --> 02:11:57.075
STUDENTS STARTED TO SHOW UP IN

02:11:57.142 --> 02:11:59.478
CLASSES MORE FREQUENTLY.

02:11:59.544 --> 02:12:00.545
THEY WERE ALERT.

02:12:00.612 --> 02:12:01.913
THEY STARTED TO PERFORM BETTER

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:02.981
ACADEMICALLY.

02:12:03.048 --> 02:12:04.850
SO TENANTS WHAT UP GRADUATION

02:12:04.916 --> 02:12:06.285
RATE WENT UP.

02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:07.653
AND SOME OTHER REMARKABLE THING

02:12:07.719 --> 02:12:10.389
STARTED TO HAPPEN.

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:11.823
CAR ACCIDENTS WENT DOWN.

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:13.525
THE INCIDENCES OF SUICIDAL

02:12:13.592 --> 02:12:15.694
THOUGHTS WENT DOWN AND I FOR ONE

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:16.828
DON'T EVER WANT TO READ IN THE

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:18.196
NEWSPAPER READ ANOTHER YOUNG

02:12:18.263 --> 02:12:19.164
PERSON.

02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:20.532
WHO'S TAKEN THEIR LIFE THROUGH

02:12:20.599 --> 02:12:21.700
SUICIDE.

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:24.736
AND SO WE KNOW FOR EVERY

02:12:24.803 --> 02:12:25.837
ADDITIONAL OUR TEENS.

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:27.839
SUICIDE GOES DOWN 11%.

02:12:27.906 --> 02:12:29.641
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY

02:12:29.708 --> 02:12:31.677
IS A RESEARCH BASED PROVEN.

02:12:31.743 --> 02:12:36.348
WAY. TO INCREASE ATTENDANCE AND

02:12:36.415 --> 02:12:37.749
INCREASE OUR TEENS HEALTH LET ME

02:12:37.816 --> 02:12:40.485
SAY THAT AGAIN TEST SCORES GO UP.

02:12:40.552 --> 02:12:42.287
CAR ACCIDENTS AND SUICIDAL

02:12:42.354 --> 02:12:44.556
THOUGHTS GO DOWN AS LONG WITH

02:12:44.623 --> 02:12:47.626
DRUG USE MARIJUANA USE OBESITY

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:50.062
ALL GO DOWN AS WELL.

02:12:50.128 --> 02:12:51.830
NOW INITIALLY WHEN IT WAS

02:12:51.897 --> 02:12:53.932
PROPOSED PEOPLE SAID WELL WHAT

02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:55.167
ABOUT ZERO PERIOD.

02:12:55.233 --> 02:12:58.103
WELL WE EXEMPTED OUT ZERO PERIOD.

02:12:58.170 --> 02:12:59.137
AND THEN THEY SAID WELL WHAT

02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:00.238
ABOUT.

02:13:00.305 --> 02:13:01.973
WORKING PARENTS VERY GOOD

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:03.942
QUESTION TO ASK AND WE SHOWED

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:05.677
THEM THE DATA AND IN PARTICULAR

02:13:05.744 --> 02:13:06.712
THE RECENT DATA FROM THE

02:13:06.778 --> 02:13:08.180
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON THAT

02:13:08.246 --> 02:13:10.382
SHOW THE BIGGEST INCREASE.

02:13:10.449 --> 02:13:12.384
IN ATTENDANCE WAS FROM CHILDREN

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:13.885
WORKING PARENT HOUSEHOLDS

02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:15.721
BECAUSE THERE'S A SOCIAL JUSTICE

02:13:15.787 --> 02:13:17.756
COMPONENT TO THIS BILL AS WELL

02:13:17.823 --> 02:13:19.091
UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:20.392
CHILDREN AND WORKING FAMILY

02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:21.960
HOUSEHOLDS ARE THE MOST SLEEP

02:13:22.027 --> 02:13:23.028
DEPRIVED CHILDREN.

02:13:23.095 --> 02:13:23.595
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MOST

02:13:23.662 --> 02:13:26.665
COMPLICATIONS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD.

02:13:26.732 --> 02:13:28.333
UNLIKE SUBURBAN CHILDREN WHICH

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:30.369
HAVE MORE ADVANTAGES SO THE VERY

02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:31.603
COHORT.

02:13:31.670 --> 02:13:33.205
THAT PEOPLE EXPRESSED TO CARE

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:35.273
ABOUT SEE SOME OF THE

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:37.876
SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC GAINS AND

02:13:37.943 --> 02:13:39.611
SOCIAL GAINS AND ATTENDANCE IS

02:13:39.678 --> 02:13:42.547
INCREASED GREAT QUESTION.

02:13:42.614 --> 02:13:44.483
THE DATA PROVES ELSE WISE WHEN

02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:47.152
WE CLARIFIED ZERO PERIOD WHEN WE

02:13:47.219 --> 02:13:49.721
GAVE IT STAGGER START TIME TO

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:50.889
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

02:13:50.956 --> 02:13:52.724
THE MOST RECENT OBJECTION IS

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:55.327
WELL EIGHTY A IS GOING TO SUFFER

02:13:55.394 --> 02:13:56.294
AGAIN.

02:13:56.361 --> 02:13:58.263
A GOOD QUESTION TO ASK BUT THE

02:13:58.330 --> 02:13:59.331
DATA SHOWS THE OPPOSITE

02:13:59.398 --> 02:14:01.700
ATTENDANCE WILL INCREASE IF THE

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:05.237
LA UNIFIED SHOWS A 1% INCREASE

02:14:05.303 --> 02:14:06.872
IN ATTENDANCE TO THE LATE START.

02:14:06.938 --> 02:14:08.273
THEY WOULD SEE A TWENTY FIVE

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.808
MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE TO THEIR

02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:11.276
BUDGET.

02:14:11.343 --> 02:14:12.444
SAID WELL WHAT ABOUT THE

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:13.945
ECONOMIC IMPACTS WELL.

02:14:14.012 --> 02:14:15.313
RAND CORPORATION THAT AN

02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:16.715
INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

02:14:16.782 --> 02:14:18.016
THAT SHOWS THE CALIFORNIA

02:14:18.083 --> 02:14:20.152
ECONOMY WOULD IMPROVE BY TEN

02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:21.420
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST

02:14:21.486 --> 02:14:22.788
YEAR OF LATE START.

02:14:22.854 --> 02:14:24.289
HOW MANY BILLS IS THIS FOR

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:26.925
PASSED ON SUSPENSIONS WELL GUESS%

02:14:26.992 --> 02:14:29.561
WHAT SUSPENSIONS GO DOWN

02:14:29.628 --> 02:14:31.062
DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR GOES DOWN

02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:33.064
OTHER BEHAVIORS IN THE CLASSROOM

02:14:33.131 --> 02:14:34.399
GO DOWN AFTER THE LATE START?

02:14:34.466 --> 02:14:37.402
SO FUNDAMENTALLY BY HAVING TEENS

02:14:37.469 --> 02:14:39.504
SLEEP ACCORDING TO THEIR

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:40.739
BIOLOGICAL CLOCK.

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:41.840
AND MOVING START TIME

02:14:41.907 --> 02:14:44.443
ACCORDINGLY WE APPROVE.

02:14:44.509 --> 02:14:45.811
ATTENDANCE.

02:14:45.877 --> 02:14:48.213
GRADES AND GRADUATION RATE AND

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.081
WE DECREASE ALL OF THE THINGS WE

02:14:50.148 --> 02:14:51.750
DEEPLY CARE ABOUT AND THINGS

02:14:51.817 --> 02:14:53.752
WE'VE RUN MANY BILLS THAT'S NOT

02:14:53.819 --> 02:14:54.586
ANECDOTE.

02:14:54.653 --> 02:14:57.155
THAT'S FACTUAL DATA SUPPORTED

02:14:57.222 --> 02:14:59.424
THE CONCLUSION SO WITH THAT I

02:14:59.491 --> 02:15:01.426
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

02:15:01.493 --> 02:15:02.961
THANK YOU SIR PORTANTINO.

02:15:03.028 --> 02:15:04.663
ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS

02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:06.665
ITEM [inaudible]

02:15:06.731 --> 02:15:10.469
SENATOR MORLOCK.

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:12.838
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT.

02:15:12.904 --> 02:15:14.139
THIS IS IMPORTANT TOPIC SOMEONE

02:15:14.206 --> 02:15:16.274
NEEDS TO GET UP AND JUST ASK A

02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:17.576
FEW QUESTIONS TO MAKE SOME

02:15:17.642 --> 02:15:20.145
OBSERVATIONS I THINK IT WAS.

02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:20.745
IN THE LOUNGE FOR SOMEONE SAID

02:15:20.812 --> 02:15:21.279
TO ME.

02:15:21.346 --> 02:15:23.215
I LIKE PROGRESS IT'S IT'S CHANGE

02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:25.150
I DON'T LIKE [inaudible]

02:15:25.217 --> 02:15:28.920
SO A PUSHING BACK THE TIME THAT

02:15:28.987 --> 02:15:31.089
SCHOOL START.

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:33.458
MAKING IT MANDATORY THIS FROM MY

02:15:33.525 --> 02:15:36.161
UNDERSTANDING NOT OPTIONAL.

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:38.063
IS IS A MASSIVE CHANGE THAT WE

02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:39.931
WILL BE.

02:15:39.998 --> 02:15:42.334
IMPOSING ON OUR NINE HUNDRED AND

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:42.968
FORTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT

02:15:43.034 --> 02:15:44.269
ARE [inaudible]

02:15:44.336 --> 02:15:48.173
NOT RURAL.

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.242
SO IF DISRUPTING THE WORK

02:15:50.308 --> 02:15:53.578
SCHEDULES -- OF PERRANCE IS NOT

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:57.082
ENOUGH TO OPPOSE SB.

02:15:57.148 --> 02:15:57.649
THREE TWENTY EIGHT IT'S MY

02:15:57.716 --> 02:15:59.251
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WILL ALSO

02:15:59.317 --> 02:16:01.520
MAKE A MAD AT A MAJOR IMPACT ON

02:16:01.586 --> 02:16:03.922
THE TRANSPORTATION FOR GETTING

02:16:03.989 --> 02:16:05.223
STUDENTS TO SCHOOL.

02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:07.158
WHICH MEANS THAT THE BUS SYSTEMS

02:16:07.225 --> 02:16:08.193
FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:10.428
ALSO BE MODIFIED AND ARE LOOKING

02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:12.063
AT INCREASED COSTS.

02:16:12.130 --> 02:16:13.765
AND I'M REALLY CONCERNED

02:16:13.832 --> 02:16:15.066
COLLEAGUES ABOUT OUR SCHOOL

02:16:15.133 --> 02:16:17.035
DISTRICTS AND THEY'RE INCURRING

02:16:17.102 --> 02:16:19.971
ANYMORE INCREASED COSTS.

02:16:20.038 --> 02:16:21.673
HAVING LOOKED AT THE NINE

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:22.274
HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SCHOOL

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:24.643
DISTRICT.

02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:25.777
AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORTS IT'S

02:16:25.844 --> 02:16:27.412
VERY DISCOURAGING AND THE NEW

02:16:27.479 --> 02:16:28.680
ONES ARE COMING OUT IN THE%

02:16:28.747 --> 02:16:29.981
BOTTOM.

02:16:30.048 --> 02:16:32.384
TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THERE.

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:33.585
UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT IS

02:16:33.652 --> 02:16:35.620
GOING UP ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS.

02:16:35.687 --> 02:16:37.856
SO IF THE CLAIMS THAT REVENUES

02:16:37.923 --> 02:16:39.624
WILL INCREASE THAT'S THAT'S

02:16:39.691 --> 02:16:41.393
THAT'S A GOOD FACT.

02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:42.460
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE IT WILL BE

02:16:42.527 --> 02:16:44.462
ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE EXPENSES

02:16:44.529 --> 02:16:46.698
THAT WILL BE INCURRED IN.

02:16:46.765 --> 02:16:47.732
THE TRANSPORTATION AREA OF THE

02:16:47.799 --> 02:16:49.834
SCHOOL DISTRICT [inaudible]

02:16:49.901 --> 02:16:53.138
JUNE. THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:16:53.204 --> 02:16:54.773
THE SACRAMENTO CITY.

02:16:54.839 --> 02:16:56.041
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD AN

02:16:56.107 --> 02:16:57.909
UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT OF FIVE

02:16:57.976 --> 02:16:59.711
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION.

02:16:59.778 --> 02:17:00.312
THEY JUST CAME OUT WITH THEIR

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:01.313
KAFFIR.

02:17:01.379 --> 02:17:03.114
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

02:17:03.181 --> 02:17:05.317
THIS YEAR JUNE THIRTY TWENTY

02:17:05.383 --> 02:17:09.254
EIGHTEEN IT IS NOW. ONE BILLION.

02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:10.255
SIXTY FIVE IT'S DOUBLED IN ONE

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:11.856
YEAR WHICH COULD BE THE RETIREE

02:17:11.923 --> 02:17:13.325
MEDICAL WE HAVE SERIOUS

02:17:13.391 --> 02:17:14.726
FINANCIAL ISSUES.

02:17:14.793 --> 02:17:16.795
FACING OUR DISTRICT SO BEFORE WE

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:17.896
ENCUMBER.

02:17:17.963 --> 02:17:19.364
THE DISTRICTS ANYMORE LET'S MAKE

02:17:19.431 --> 02:17:20.832
SURE THEY HAVE STRONG BALANCE

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:22.634
SHEETS AND LET'S MAKE SURE THEY

02:17:22.701 --> 02:17:23.768
HAVE LOCAL CONTROL.

02:17:23.835 --> 02:17:25.136
AND FOR THOSE REASONS I

02:17:25.203 --> 02:17:27.973
ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE ON SB.

02:17:28.039 --> 02:17:29.541
THREE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU SIR

02:17:29.608 --> 02:17:33.912
MORE LIKE SENATOR MITCHELL.

02:17:33.979 --> 02:17:35.447
THANK YOU CAN A PRESIDENT.

02:17:35.513 --> 02:17:36.815
BUT CERTAINLY THE SATIN LISTEN

02:17:36.881 --> 02:17:37.582
TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE

02:17:37.649 --> 02:17:39.217
COUNTY GIVE US THE VARIOUS

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:40.685
REASONS WHY WE SHOULDN'T SUPPORT

02:17:40.752 --> 02:17:41.820
THE BILL.

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:43.655
IT STRUCK ME THAT AT NO POINT

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:47.192
DID ANY OF HIS ARGUMENTS ADDRESS

02:17:47.259 --> 02:17:48.193
THE NEEDS.

02:17:48.259 --> 02:17:49.794
OF THE STUDENTS.

02:17:49.861 --> 02:17:51.496
IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM.

02:17:51.563 --> 02:17:54.366
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO

02:17:54.432 --> 02:17:55.700
EDUCATE.

02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:58.703
OUR KIDS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

02:17:58.770 --> 02:17:59.738
AND SO WHILE I APPRECIATE

02:17:59.804 --> 02:18:01.606
CHANGES HARD FOR SOME.

02:18:01.673 --> 02:18:03.208
MANY OF US HAVE TRAVELED AROUND

02:18:03.274 --> 02:18:05.577
THE WORLD AND HAS SEEN COUNTRIES

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:07.412
WHERE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL SIX

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:08.880
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WE'RE CLEAR

02:18:08.947 --> 02:18:11.049
THAT OUR SEPTEMBER TO JUNE IS

02:18:11.116 --> 02:18:13.451
BASED ON AN AGRARIAN SYSTEM THAT

02:18:13.518 --> 02:18:14.886
NO LONGER IMPACTS THE VAST

02:18:14.953 --> 02:18:16.688
MAJORITY OF SCHOOL STUDENTS IN

02:18:16.755 --> 02:18:18.923
SCHOOL ACROSS.

02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:20.225
THIS GREAT STATE.

02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:21.893
AND YET ON THIS FLOOR WE

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:23.428
CONTINUE TO DEBATE SCHOOL

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:26.097
READINESS GRADUATION RATES OF

02:18:26.164 --> 02:18:27.565
THE EMPLOYERS ARE IN OUR

02:18:27.632 --> 02:18:28.633
DISTRICTS TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR

02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:31.102
NOT THE NEXT GENERATION OF OF

02:18:31.169 --> 02:18:33.271
EMPLOYEES ARE INNOVATORS FOR

02:18:33.338 --> 02:18:33.838
THAT MATTER ARE GOING TO BE

02:18:33.905 --> 02:18:36.307
PREPARED. TO CONTINUE TO LEAD

02:18:36.374 --> 02:18:38.176
THE GRAY CITY CALIFORNIA.

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:39.377
SO I HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE OPEN

02:18:39.444 --> 02:18:43.048
MINDED ENOUGH. TO RELY ON THE

02:18:43.114 --> 02:18:44.816
DATA AND RESEARCH. TO REALLY

02:18:44.883 --> 02:18:48.086
DETERMINE WHAT DO STUDENTS NEED

02:18:48.153 --> 02:18:50.522
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

02:18:50.588 --> 02:18:54.426
AND BUILD A DISTRICT ANY SYSTEM

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:55.960
AROUND THAT.

02:18:56.027 --> 02:18:57.595
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT HAS

02:18:57.662 --> 02:18:59.664
HISTORICALLY BEEN OUR PATTERN

02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:02.801
PRACTICE.

02:19:02.867 --> 02:19:04.469
AND TO REALLY BE WILLING TO PUSH

02:19:04.536 --> 02:19:05.870
THE ENVELOPE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:19:05.937 --> 02:19:07.605
WE'RE DEVELOPING A SYSTEM IN AND

02:19:07.672 --> 02:19:09.140
FUNDING A SYSTEM.

02:19:09.207 --> 02:19:11.109
THAT MEETS THEIR FUNDAMENTAL

02:19:11.176 --> 02:19:13.178
NEEDS FOR THOSE REASONS I AM

02:19:13.244 --> 02:19:14.579

ON OUR KIDS AND OUR ABILITY TO

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:48.807
LEARN.

02:20:48.873 --> 02:20:50.441
AND WHAT WE THINK ABOUT.

02:20:50.508 --> 02:20:51.242
OUR TEENAGERS WHEN THEY GO TO

02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:52.944

ON ICE MASON THE NOTHING IN THE

02:24:08.406 --> 02:24:10.308
BILL WOULD PROHIBIT IF I WAS A

02:24:10.375 --> 02:24:12.076
SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT ABOUT IT

02:24:12.143 --> 02:24:13.511
DO WILL START TIME. FOR THE

02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:15.079
ELEMENTARY'S AT VERSES THE

MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS.

02:24:16.414 --> 02:24:17.081
NOTHING IN THE BILL WOULD

02:24:17.148 --> 02:24:18.883
PROHIBIT THE DISTRICT FROM

02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:20.251
STARTING EVERYBODY THE SAME TIME

02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:21.853
SO THAT LATER IS THAT CORRECT

02:24:21.919 --> 02:24:23.154
CORRECT OKAY.

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:24.288
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING THE

02:24:24.355 --> 02:24:25.723
SECOND THING I I JUST WANT TO

02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:26.424
RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF THE

02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:27.158
CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING

02:24:27.225 --> 02:24:30.328
THAT I SHARE AND I FIND MYSELF --

02:24:30.395 --> 02:24:31.462
YOU KNOW NOT VOTING FOR EVERY

02:24:31.529 --> 02:24:33.164
BILL THAT COMES BEFORE US THAT

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:34.132
IMPINGES UPON SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:36.234
OF CONTROL BECAUSE I MYSELF

02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:37.268
SERVE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD.

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:38.503
I AM ALWAYS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:24:38.569 --> 02:24:39.637
THESE KINDS OF ISSUES WHAT

02:24:39.704 --> 02:24:40.872
BRINGS ME TO SUPPORT FOR THIS

02:24:40.938 --> 02:24:41.939
BILL IS MY OWN PERSONAL

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:42.673
EXPERIENCE HAVING SERVED ON THE

02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:44.242
SCHOOL BOARD HAVING LOOKED INTO

02:24:44.308 --> 02:24:45.910
THIS VERY ISSUE BECAUSE I SAW

02:24:45.977 --> 02:24:48.679
THE SIGN SO YOU SAW -- BUT BACK

02:24:48.746 --> 02:24:49.380
WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD AND I

02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:51.082
LOOKED I KIND OF EXPLORING THE

02:24:51.149 --> 02:24:53.284
IDEA OF MOVING UP ARE START TIME

02:24:53.351 --> 02:24:54.719
IN MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT.

02:24:54.786 --> 02:24:56.621
AND WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS THAT

02:24:56.687 --> 02:24:57.889
THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD DO IT

02:24:57.955 --> 02:25:00.258
OUR ON OUR OWN BECAUSE OF SPORTS

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:03.494
SCHEDULES AND THE IMPACT ON ON

02:25:03.561 --> 02:25:05.329
ON ON THAT WITH REGARDS TO ALL

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:06.531
THE OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT

02:25:06.597 --> 02:25:08.599
WE INTERACT WITH AND PLAYED WITH

02:25:08.666 --> 02:25:09.133
AN ENGAGED WITH.

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:11.135
AND SO THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE I

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:13.404
ACTUALLY THINK IT'S OKAY FOR US

02:25:13.471 --> 02:25:14.605
TO BE -- AND PINGING ON LOCAL

02:25:14.672 --> 02:25:16.174
CONTROL BECAUSE THERE IS A

02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:18.242
COLLECTIVE ACTION ISSUE HERE --

02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:19.677
IT WITH ONE SCHOOL IF IF SCHOOL

02:25:19.744 --> 02:25:20.945
DISTRICT'S GONNA GO OFF ON THEIR

02:25:21.012 --> 02:25:22.747
OWN IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IT

02:25:22.814 --> 02:25:24.782
MESSES UP THE ENTIRE ATHLETIC

02:25:24.849 --> 02:25:26.617
SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WILL BE --

02:25:26.684 --> 02:25:28.719
VERY PROBLEMATIC AND SO -- THAT

02:25:28.786 --> 02:25:29.754
THAT THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:32.156
REASONS WHY I THINK -- IT'S IT'S

02:25:32.223 --> 02:25:35.059
WORTH -- STEPPING IN AND TAKING

02:25:35.126 --> 02:25:37.495
A STATE ACTION ON ON ON THIS

02:25:37.562 --> 02:25:38.629
NARROW ISSUE THAT REALLY DOES

02:25:38.696 --> 02:25:41.232
ULTIMATELY RELATE A GREAT DEAL

02:25:41.299 --> 02:25:48.706
TO THE BIOLOGICAL PATTERNS AND

02:25:48.773 --> 02:25:48.940
HEALTH.

02:25:49.006 --> 02:25:50.842
OF OUR TEENAGERS.

02:25:50.908 --> 02:25:51.409
THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN ANY

02:25:51.476 --> 02:25:52.710
FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION

02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:53.544
SEEING AND HEARING NONE.

02:25:53.611 --> 02:25:54.812
SENATOR PORTANTINO.

02:25:54.879 --> 02:25:56.380
IT IS YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU A

02:25:56.447 --> 02:25:57.348
MATTER PRESIDENT I CAN ADDRESS

02:25:57.415 --> 02:25:58.883
SOME OF THE COMMENTS -- DURING

02:25:58.950 --> 02:26:01.185
MY CLOTHES I KNOW WE WANT TO

02:26:01.252 --> 02:26:01.886
KEEP MOVING BUT I THINK IT'S

02:26:01.953 --> 02:26:04.288
IMPORTANT -- FIRST OF ALL THE

02:26:04.355 --> 02:26:06.324
ACTED THE ECONOMIC QUESTIONS ARE

02:26:06.390 --> 02:26:08.693
AGAIN THE RIGHT QUESTION TO ASK --

02:26:08.759 --> 02:26:11.062
BUT THERE IS NO DATA TO SUPPORT

02:26:11.129 --> 02:26:12.730
THE NOTION THAT IT'S GOING TO

02:26:12.797 --> 02:26:14.432
INCREASE COSTS AND ACTUALLY THE

02:26:14.499 --> 02:26:16.033
RAND CORPORATION STUDY SAYS FOR

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:17.068
EVERY DOLLAR SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:26:17.135 --> 02:26:18.069
INVEST.

02:26:18.136 --> 02:26:19.036
IN LATE START THEY'RE GONNA

02:26:19.103 --> 02:26:21.372
RETURN FOR DID FOUR DOLLARS BACK

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:22.540
SO THERE'S ECONOMIC DATA TO SHOW

02:26:22.607 --> 02:26:24.442
THE CONTRARY ON THE BUS

02:26:24.509 --> 02:26:25.943
SCHEDULES WE TRIED TO BE

02:26:26.010 --> 02:26:28.012
EXTREMELY SENSITIVE WHICH IS WHY

02:26:28.079 --> 02:26:29.714
WE SAID A DIFFERENT MINIMUM FOR

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:30.982
MIDDLE SCHOOL IN A DIFFERENT

02:26:31.048 --> 02:26:32.216
MINIMUM. FOR HIGH SCHOOL

02:26:32.283 --> 02:26:34.452
PRECISELY TO GIVE DISTRICTS THAT

02:26:34.519 --> 02:26:36.587
FLEXIBILITY. TO WORK OUT THEIR

02:26:36.654 --> 02:26:38.623
LOGISTICS AND THAT'S A VERY VERY

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:40.725
IMPORTANT POINT WE ARE NOT

02:26:40.791 --> 02:26:42.460
SETTING A HARD TIME.

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:44.328
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SETS A

02:26:44.395 --> 02:26:46.297
MINIMUM STANDARD BASED ON

02:26:46.364 --> 02:26:48.533
RESEARCH FOR HEALTH AND WELFARE?

02:26:48.599 --> 02:26:50.001
THAT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN SETTING

02:26:50.067 --> 02:26:52.537
A MINIMUM STANDARD ON LEAD PAINT.

02:26:52.603 --> 02:26:55.606
OR ON A SPACE THIS YOU SET

02:26:55.673 --> 02:26:57.408
MINIMUM CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS

02:26:57.475 --> 02:26:59.310
BASED ON SCIENCE WERE SETTING A

02:26:59.377 --> 02:27:01.245
MINIMUM HEALTH AND WELFARE

02:27:01.312 --> 02:27:02.313
STANDARD.

02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:03.681
BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF

02:27:03.748 --> 02:27:05.783
PEDIATRICIANS AND THE CENTERS

02:27:05.850 --> 02:27:07.318
FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND THEN

02:27:07.385 --> 02:27:09.954
FINALLY AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS

02:27:10.021 --> 02:27:11.923
ANGELES AND THE GOOD

02:27:11.989 --> 02:27:13.658
PEDIATRICIAN FROM SACRAMENTO

02:27:13.724 --> 02:27:14.725
POINTED OUT.

02:27:14.792 --> 02:27:15.960
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING WHAT'S

02:27:16.027 --> 02:27:18.863
IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR

02:27:18.930 --> 02:27:19.830
CHILDREN.

02:27:19.897 --> 02:27:21.098
AND THAT'S NOT A MONETARY

02:27:21.165 --> 02:27:23.267
CONVERSATION THAT'S A HUMAN.

02:27:23.334 --> 02:27:25.436
CONVERSATION OUR CHILDREN WILL

02:27:25.503 --> 02:27:27.872
BE HEALTHIER HAPPIER AND PERFORM

02:27:27.939 --> 02:27:29.774
BETTER AND FRANKLY TAKE THEIR

02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:30.641
OWN LIFE.

02:27:30.708 --> 02:27:33.878
LIFE LESS IF WE DO LATE START

02:27:33.945 --> 02:27:35.546
AND THE RESEARCHERS IN THEIR

02:27:35.613 --> 02:27:36.881
CONCLUDING STATEMENT ALWAYS

02:27:36.948 --> 02:27:39.016
ENDED WITH WE KNOW THERE WILL BE

02:27:39.083 --> 02:27:41.752
ADULT LOGISTICAL CONCERNS.

02:27:41.819 --> 02:27:44.222
BUT THE OVERRIDING HEALTH AND

02:27:44.288 --> 02:27:46.457
WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN DEMAND

02:27:46.524 --> 02:27:48.526
THAT WE MAKE THAT STATEMENT NOW

02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:49.627
I'VE DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE I'VE

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:51.929

SENATOR ROTH AND ACT REALLY IN A

02:30:48.672 --> 02:30:49.106
WATER.

02:30:49.173 --> 02:30:51.242
SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU MADAM

02:30:51.308 --> 02:30:52.309
PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES.

02:30:52.376 --> 02:30:53.611
FOR THOSE YOU WERE DOING OTHER

02:30:53.677 --> 02:30:54.812
THINGS THIS IS THE COULD EASE

02:30:54.879 --> 02:30:57.815
BILL.

02:30:57.882 --> 02:30:58.315
BUT THAT WOULD GET YOUR

02:30:58.382 --> 02:31:03.421
ATTENTION. FOR THE PAST TWENTY

02:31:03.487 --> 02:31:04.755
YEARS COULD EASE A CORPORATE

02:31:04.822 --> 02:31:06.323
LANDOWNER IN THE MOJAVE HIS

02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:08.559
PROPOSED TO PUMP AN AVERAGE OF

02:31:08.626 --> 02:31:09.627
FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET.

02:31:09.693 --> 02:31:11.695
OF WATER PER YEAR THAT'S OVER

02:31:11.762 --> 02:31:14.231
SIXTEEN BILLION GALLONS A YEAR.

02:31:14.298 --> 02:31:15.800
FOR FIFTY YEARS FROM THE AQUIFER

02:31:15.866 --> 02:31:16.867
UNDER THE MOJAVE AND SELL IT TO

02:31:16.934 --> 02:31:18.969
WATER DISTRICTS IN OTHER PARTS

02:31:19.036 --> 02:31:19.637
OF THE STATE AT A PROIT OF

02:31:19.703 --> 02:31:21.272
COURSE. FOR PURPOSES OF

02:31:21.338 --> 02:31:24.241
GUARANTEEING WATER SUPPLY TO

02:31:24.308 --> 02:31:24.842
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR

02:31:24.909 --> 02:31:25.476
MORE.

02:31:25.543 --> 02:31:28.312
NEW HOMES THE PROBLEM IS THAT

02:31:28.379 --> 02:31:29.880
THE SCIENCE UNDERLYING THIS

02:31:29.947 --> 02:31:31.816
PROJECT IS IN SERIOUS CONFLICT

02:31:31.882 --> 02:31:33.217
AS TO WHAT AND ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:31:33.284 --> 02:31:34.718
SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE REALLY

02:31:34.785 --> 02:31:36.353
IS.

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:38.389
AND IF COULD EASE IS WRONG.

02:31:38.456 --> 02:31:40.024
THAT LEVEL OF PUMPING THE

02:31:40.090 --> 02:31:42.026
PUMPING PROPOSED.

02:31:42.092 --> 02:31:43.327
COULD POTENTIALLY DESTROYING.

02:31:43.394 --> 02:31:45.062
THE MOJAVE DESERT IN THE PROCESS

02:31:45.129 --> 02:31:46.430
AND BY THE WAY WHEN THE PUMPING

02:31:46.497 --> 02:31:47.798
STOPS.

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:49.800
IMPAIR THE WATER SUPPLY TO THOSE

02:31:49.867 --> 02:31:51.101
NEW HOMES.

02:31:51.168 --> 02:31:52.636
NOW THIS BILL SEEKS TO HIT THE

02:31:52.703 --> 02:31:54.672
PAUSE BUTTON ON THIS MASSIVE

02:31:54.738 --> 02:31:56.173
WATER EXTRACTION PROJECT.

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:58.375
IN THIS VERY FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM

02:31:58.442 --> 02:31:59.710
THAT HAS EXISTED IN BALLOTS FOR

02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:01.378
CENTURIES.

02:32:01.445 --> 02:32:02.746
AND HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON TO

02:32:02.813 --> 02:32:04.148
ENSURE THAT WE GET THE SCIENCE

02:32:04.215 --> 02:32:05.416
RIGHT THAT THE SCIENCE IS

02:32:05.483 --> 02:32:07.084
RECONCILED.

02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:10.221
THE PROJECT HAS BEEN STALLED.

02:32:10.287 --> 02:32:12.022
FOR YEARS BECAUSE FRANKLY THE

02:32:12.089 --> 02:32:13.691
MATH DOESN'T ADD UP.

02:32:13.757 --> 02:32:15.259
AS I INDICATED KIDDIES WANTS TO

02:32:15.326 --> 02:32:16.861
PULL FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET

02:32:16.927 --> 02:32:18.562
PER YEAR OUT AND HAS NEVER

02:32:18.629 --> 02:32:21.298
CHANGED AS TO THAT AMOUNT.

02:32:21.365 --> 02:32:22.933
BUT ADMITS THAT THE AQUIFER ONLY

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:26.270
REFILLS AT THE RATE OF THIRTY

02:32:26.337 --> 02:32:28.506
TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR.

02:32:28.572 --> 02:32:29.740
NOW RENOWNED SCIENTISTS.

02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:30.841
WORKING WITH THE U. S.

02:32:30.908 --> 02:32:32.943
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY THE NATIONAL

02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:35.012
PARK SERVICE AND OTHERS SAY THE

02:32:35.079 --> 02:32:38.115
REFILL RATE IS MORE LIKE.

02:32:38.182 --> 02:32:41.085
200-021-0000 ACRE FEET PER YEAR.

02:32:41.151 --> 02:32:42.520
NOW IF THE CHILL OUT OF THE

02:32:42.586 --> 02:32:44.321
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY IN THE PARK

02:32:44.388 --> 02:32:45.756
SERVICE.

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:47.324
SCIENCE [inaudible]

02:32:47.391 --> 02:32:49.159
IS CORRECT.

02:32:49.226 --> 02:32:51.095
THAT'S AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND

02:32:51.161 --> 02:32:53.063
ACRE FEET PER YEAR THAT'S

02:32:53.130 --> 02:32:55.766
FOURTEEN BILLION GALLONS LESS

02:32:55.833 --> 02:32:57.101
THAN THE COULD THESE PLANS.

02:32:57.167 --> 02:33:00.337
PULLING OUT MORE THAN GOES IN.

02:33:00.404 --> 02:33:01.338
NOW CLEARLY THERE IS A SERIOUS

02:33:01.405 --> 02:33:02.840
CONFLICT IN THE SCIENCE

02:33:02.907 --> 02:33:04.542
SOMEWHERE HERE SURROUNDING THIS

02:33:04.608 --> 02:33:05.609
PROJECT.

02:33:05.676 --> 02:33:08.045
AND IF COULD DISS MISCALCULATED.

02:33:08.112 --> 02:33:09.513
THE SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RIGHT

02:33:09.580 --> 02:33:10.748
NOT ONLY WILL THE ECOSYSTEM IN

02:33:10.814 --> 02:33:12.249
THE MOJAVE FACE DESTRUCTION BUT

02:33:12.316 --> 02:33:13.951
AS I INDICATED BEFORE WE HAVE A

02:33:14.018 --> 02:33:16.353
pSERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THOSE HOMES.

02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:18.355
HAVE BEEN PROMISED WATER FROM

02:33:18.422 --> 02:33:20.991
THIS PROJECT.

02:33:21.058 --> 02:33:22.259
WE THINK THE CONFLICT SHOULD BE

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:23.794
RESOLVED BEFORE THE PUMPING

02:33:23.861 --> 02:33:26.230
STARTS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

02:33:26.297 --> 02:33:28.432
DOES NO MORE.

CONFLICT IN FAVOR OF GOODIES AND

02:33:48.252 --> 02:33:50.454
VALIDATED IT'S PUMPING PROPOSAL.

02:33:50.521 --> 02:33:52.356
UNFORTUNATELY I'M HERE TO TELL

02:33:52.423 --> 02:33:54.391

PUBLIC DISCLOSURE STATUTE THAT

02:33:58.329 --> 02:34:00.598
REQUIRES PROJECT PROPONENTS AND

02:34:00.664 --> 02:34:02.299
THE COURTS. TO IDENTIFY

02:34:02.366 --> 02:34:04.001
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF A

02:34:04.068 --> 02:34:06.370
PROPOSED PROJECT AND WAYS TO

02:34:06.437 --> 02:34:08.005
MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS.

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:09.340
IN FACT IN REVIEWING THE

02:34:09.406 --> 02:34:11.342
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR AND

02:34:11.408 --> 02:34:14.244
AGAINST THE PROJECT SUCH AS THE

02:34:14.311 --> 02:34:15.479
PUMPING RATES HERE.

02:34:15.546 --> 02:34:17.247
AS THE COURT IN COULD DISS OWN

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:19.483
CASE NOTED COURTS ARE NOT

02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:21.452

EVIDENCE PRESENTED.

02:34:25.356 --> 02:34:26.190
AND THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE

02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:27.625
COURTS STATEMENT IN REVIEWING

02:34:27.691 --> 02:34:29.393
THE LEAD AGENCIES ACTIONS UNDER

02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:32.029
SEQUEL WE MAY NOT SET ASIDE.

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:33.931

02:34:33.998 --> 02:34:35.733
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT ON

02:34:35.799 --> 02:34:37.167
THE GROUND THAT AN OPPOSITE

02:34:37.234 --> 02:34:38.602
CONCLUSION WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:34:38.669 --> 02:34:41.805
EQUALLY OR MORE REASONABLE.

02:34:41.872 --> 02:34:43.507
IN CASE THERE'S ANY DOUBT AND

02:34:43.574 --> 02:34:44.675
THERE SHOULDN'T BE SINCE I'VE

02:34:44.742 --> 02:34:45.909
BEEN SAYING THE SAME THING SINCE

02:34:45.976 --> 02:34:47.745
I GOT INVOLVED.

02:34:47.811 --> 02:34:49.013
FROM WITH THIS BILL AT THE

02:34:49.079 --> 02:34:50.848
OUTSET I'M NOT TRYING TO PREVENT

02:34:50.914 --> 02:34:52.816
THE PUMPING OF WATER FROM THIS

02:34:52.883 --> 02:34:54.718
AQUIFER BYE KIDDIES OR ANY

02:34:54.785 --> 02:34:56.587
FUTURE LANDOWNER IN THE MOJAVE

02:34:56.654 --> 02:34:58.789
I'M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE

02:34:58.856 --> 02:34:59.223
NEED.

02:34:59.289 --> 02:35:01.659
MORE WATER BUT I'M SIMPLY TRYING

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:03.594
TO ENSURE THAT ANY PUMPING NOW

02:35:03.661 --> 02:35:05.763
OR IN THE FUTURE IS DONE IN AN

02:35:05.829 --> 02:35:08.866
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE WAY

02:35:08.932 --> 02:35:10.567
AND AT AN ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:35:10.634 --> 02:35:12.169
SUSTAINABLE RATE.

02:35:12.236 --> 02:35:13.637
SO AS I SAID I THINK WE SHOULD

02:35:13.704 --> 02:35:15.205
HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON HERE AND

02:35:15.272 --> 02:35:16.407
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT TEAM OF

02:35:16.473 --> 02:35:18.008
SCIENTISTS REVIEW THE SCIENTIFIC

02:35:18.075 --> 02:35:20.210
EVIDENCE. FOR AND AGAINST THE

02:35:20.277 --> 02:35:21.812
KIDDIES PROJECT AND RESOLVE THE

02:35:21.879 --> 02:35:23.947

02:35:24.014 --> 02:35:25.849
WRITTEN FINDINGS WHICH THIS BILL

02:35:25.916 --> 02:35:26.984

02:35:27.051 --> 02:35:27.718
SENATE ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:35:27.785 --> 02:35:29.753
SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE ONE

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:31.555
THAT INSURERS AN UNINTERRUPTED

02:35:31.622 --> 02:35:33.857
SUPPLY OF WATER TO ALL RESIDENTS

02:35:33.924 --> 02:35:35.259
WHILE PROTECTING A NATIONAL

02:35:35.325 --> 02:35:37.861
TREASURE IN THIS CASE THE MOJAVE.

02:35:37.928 --> 02:35:39.063
FROM POTENTIAL MANMADE

02:35:39.129 --> 02:35:41.632
DESTRUCTION THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

02:35:41.699 --> 02:35:42.933
THIS BILL DOES.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:44.301
NOW WHY HASN'T KIDDIES MADE AN

02:35:44.368 --> 02:35:45.736
EFFORT TO RECONCILE THE SCIENCE

02:35:45.803 --> 02:35:49.206
EARLIER I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

02:35:49.273 --> 02:35:50.741
IDEA.

02:35:50.808 --> 02:35:51.809
NOW I'M GONNA ATTEMPT TO DEAL

02:35:51.875 --> 02:35:52.443
WITH SOME OF COULD DISS CLAIMS

02:35:52.509 --> 02:35:53.944
THAT I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD I'VE

02:35:54.011 --> 02:35:55.379
CERTAINLY HEARD A LOT OF THEM.

02:35:55.446 --> 02:35:56.980

02:36:00.117 --> 02:36:00.718
BUILDING.

02:36:00.784 --> 02:36:02.419
NOW THE BILL DEALS WITH ADVERSE

02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:04.922
EFFECTS ON NATURAL OR CULTURAL

02:36:04.988 --> 02:36:06.423

CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT SEQUEL

02:36:17.868 --> 02:36:19.203
AND THE FEDERAL EQUIVALENT WHICH

FOUND AS A RESULT OF THIS STUDY

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:24.835
ONE ADDITIONAL MOLECULE.

02:37:24.902 --> 02:37:27.104
THAT THE AGENCIES CAN KILL THE

02:37:59.369 --> 02:38:00.871
NOW I'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS THE

02:38:00.938 --> 02:38:02.573
SEQUEL ISSUE AND AND THE OTHER

02:40:02.059 --> 02:40:03.827
TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE TRIED TO

02:40:03.894 --> 02:40:05.128
WORK WITH KIDDIES THROUGHOUT

02:40:05.195 --> 02:40:06.530
THIS PROCESS.

02:40:06.596 --> 02:40:08.832
I HAVE SAT THROUGH NUMEROUS

02:40:08.899 --> 02:40:09.399
MEETINGS BOTH HERE IN THE

02:40:09.466 --> 02:40:11.234
CAPITAL AND IN THE DISTRICT

02:40:11.301 --> 02:40:13.270
ATTEMPTING TO WORK OUT.

02:40:13.337 --> 02:40:17.207
COULD DISS CONCERNS.

02:40:17.274 --> 02:40:18.608
SO LONG AS WE GET THE

02:40:18.675 --> 02:40:20.077
RECONCILIATION OF THE SCIENCE I

02:40:20.143 --> 02:40:21.378
HAVE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING

02:40:21.445 --> 02:40:23.180
THAT THE ONLY THING THAT I'M

02:40:23.246 --> 02:40:24.481
INTERESTED IN WITH THIS BILL.

02:40:24.548 --> 02:40:26.650
IS TO HAVE A TOP DOWN REVIEW OF

02:40:26.717 --> 02:40:28.318
THE SCIENCE THE CONFLICTS IN THE

02:40:28.385 --> 02:40:30.220
SCIENCE AND A RECONCILIATION OF

02:40:30.287 --> 02:40:31.755
THE SCIENCE AND THE SETTING OF

02:40:31.822 --> 02:40:33.357
AN ENIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE

02:40:33.423 --> 02:40:34.224
PUMPING.

02:40:34.291 --> 02:40:38.328
NO MORE NO LESS NOW DURING THESE

02:40:38.395 --> 02:40:40.297
VARIOUS MEETINGS AND WE WE

02:40:40.364 --> 02:40:41.865
STARTED WITH A VARIETY OF

02:40:41.932 --> 02:40:43.233
AMENDMENTS BEING EXCHANGED

02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:44.267
INCLUDING THE FIRST ONE WITH

02:40:44.334 --> 02:40:45.535
COULD THESE WHICH WANTED TO

02:40:45.602 --> 02:40:47.704
LIMIT THE REVIEW. TO THE SCIENCE

02:40:47.771 --> 02:40:48.605
IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

02:40:48.672 --> 02:40:51.708
REPORT AND SET THE TIME LINE FOR

02:40:51.775 --> 02:40:53.110
THAT REVIEW IT SIXTY DAYS.

02:40:53.176 --> 02:40:54.378
NOW YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT IF

02:40:54.444 --> 02:40:55.912
YOU'RE VIOLATING SCIENCE IN YOUR

02:40:55.979 --> 02:40:57.647
HIRING HIRING NEW SCIENCE IN

02:40:57.714 --> 02:40:59.716
TRYING TO RECONCILE SIXTY DAYS

02:40:59.783 --> 02:41:01.218
IS COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE

02:41:01.284 --> 02:41:02.753
OBVIOUSLY THAT AMENDMENT DIDN'T

02:41:02.819 --> 02:41:03.286
WORK.

02:41:03.353 --> 02:41:05.655
WE WENT BACK AND FORTH AND WENT

02:41:05.722 --> 02:41:07.724
BACK AND FORTH NOW COULD HE'S

02:41:07.791 --> 02:41:08.859
ONE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

02:41:08.925 --> 02:41:10.460
RESOURCES ADDED TO THIS BILL SO

02:41:10.527 --> 02:41:12.229
WE ADDED THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

02:41:12.295 --> 02:41:13.130
RESOURCES.

02:41:13.196 --> 02:41:14.865
COULD HE'S ONE OF THE PROCESS SO

02:41:14.931 --> 02:41:16.900
WE ADDED A PROCESS COULD HE'S

02:41:16.967 --> 02:41:18.635
ONE OF THE TIMELINE IN A TIME

02:41:18.702 --> 02:41:21.004
LIMIT PUT ON THE REVIEW WE DID

02:41:21.071 --> 02:41:21.538
SELL.

02:41:21.605 --> 02:41:23.407
FRANKLY I COULDN'T AGREE TO

02:41:23.473 --> 02:41:25.242
EVERYTHING KIDDIES WANTED BUT I

02:41:25.308 --> 02:41:26.543
DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I COULD

02:41:26.610 --> 02:41:28.378
HAVE DONE A CURRENTLY WHAT I DID

02:41:28.445 --> 02:41:31.248
WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR KIDDIES.

02:41:31.314 --> 02:41:33.250
SO COLLEAGUES LONG GOING TO BE A

02:41:33.316 --> 02:41:34.785
LONG DAY I APPRECIATE YOUR

02:41:34.851 --> 02:41:38.021

BUT ONE OR TWO TIMES IN THE SIX

02:41:44.694 --> 02:41:45.796
AND A HALF YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN

02:41:45.862 --> 02:41:48.365
ON THIS.

02:41:48.432 --> 02:41:49.733
FOR SO.

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:50.333
AND I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT

02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:52.302
BILL.

02:41:52.369 --> 02:41:54.071
SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN.

02:41:54.137 --> 02:41:55.405
I WOULD ASK YOUR HELP AND I

I WANT.

02:42:10.754 --> 02:42:13.356
TO FIRST START OFF WITH -- I

02:42:13.423 --> 02:42:15.092
DON'T HAVE THE INTIMATE

02:42:15.158 --> 02:42:17.494
KNOWLEDGE ON THIS ISSUE AS MY

02:42:17.561 --> 02:42:19.596
COLLEAGUE AND THE AUTHOR OF THIS

02:42:19.663 --> 02:42:21.164
BILL DOES.

02:42:21.231 --> 02:42:22.799
BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM WHAT I

02:42:22.866 --> 02:42:25.368
DO KNOW THIS AUTHOR -- HE IS AN

02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:27.971
OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL AND IF.

02:42:28.038 --> 02:42:30.107
INTEGRITY WAS EVER QUESTIONS

02:42:30.173 --> 02:42:31.875
THAT I WOULD QUESTION THOSE THAT

02:42:31.942 --> 02:42:32.943
MIGHT PUT FORWARD SUCH

02:42:33.009 --> 02:42:34.678
ALLEGATIONS SO.

02:42:34.744 --> 02:42:36.246
I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

02:42:36.313 --> 02:42:37.547
THAT'S THAT'S PUT OUT THERE.

02:42:37.614 --> 02:42:39.749
BUT FROM MY STANDPOINT AS A

02:42:39.816 --> 02:42:41.651
MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THAT

02:42:41.718 --> 02:42:42.853
REVIEWED THIS ISSUE [inaudible]

02:42:42.919 --> 02:42:45.655
THE SO I SAT ON THE POLICY

02:42:45.722 --> 02:42:47.691
COMMITTEE ON PARTICIPATING RIGHT

02:42:47.757 --> 02:42:49.159
IN ONE OF THE MOST DELIBERATE

02:42:49.226 --> 02:42:50.360
DISCUSSIONS OF THE POLICY

02:42:50.427 --> 02:42:53.363
QUESTIONS POSED BY THIS BILL --

02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:55.098
BOTH SIDES PREVENTED GOOD

02:42:55.165 --> 02:42:57.167
CREDIBLE POLICY ARGUMENTS AS WE

02:42:57.234 --> 02:42:58.702
DELIVERY THIS BILL IT BECAME

02:42:58.768 --> 02:43:00.737
CLEAR TO ME.

02:43:00.804 --> 02:43:02.506
THAT THERE APPEARED TO BE A PATH

02:43:02.572 --> 02:43:04.441
FORWARD.

02:43:04.508 --> 02:43:05.742
A RECONCILIATION OF THE

02:43:05.809 --> 02:43:07.611
POSITIONS ESPECIALLY ON A

02:43:07.677 --> 02:43:10.147
BIPARTISAN BASIS I WAS VERY --

02:43:10.213 --> 02:43:11.748
EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

02:43:11.815 --> 02:43:13.450
I REYES TO CONSIDER THE REVIEW

02:43:13.517 --> 02:43:15.185
SHOULD NOT TRY TO REDO THE

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:16.586
SEQUEL PROCESS.

02:43:16.653 --> 02:43:20.090
I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE AREAS

02:43:20.157 --> 02:43:22.058
OF ROB -- WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF

02:43:22.125 --> 02:43:24.494
HAVING A SEQUEL REVIEW PROCESS?

02:43:24.561 --> 02:43:26.897
IF THERE WILL BE TRAILER

02:43:26.963 --> 02:43:29.699
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS ATTACHED

02:43:29.766 --> 02:43:32.169
AD NAUSEAM -- SO I BELIEVE AT

02:43:32.235 --> 02:43:33.103
LEAST FROM A LEGAL AND

02:43:33.170 --> 02:43:34.504
PROCEDURAL STANDPOINT.

02:43:34.571 --> 02:43:36.806
YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO ADD

02:43:36.873 --> 02:43:39.442
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND LEGAL

02:43:39.509 --> 02:43:40.810
PROCEDURES.

02:43:40.877 --> 02:43:43.747
BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT A DESIRED

02:43:43.813 --> 02:43:46.983
OUTCOME -- I THINK THAT IS KIND

02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:48.451
OF WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS THAT.

02:43:48.518 --> 02:43:50.086
INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE

02:43:50.153 --> 02:43:51.621
CHALLENGING THIS PROJECT WE'RE

02:43:51.688 --> 02:43:55.192
NOT FINDING THE DESIRED OUTCOME.

02:43:55.258 --> 02:43:57.961
THAT THEY WERE -- ACCRETING NEW

02:43:58.028 --> 02:43:59.462
PROCEDURAL AND REGULATORY

02:43:59.529 --> 02:44:01.932
OBSTACLES TO MAKE THIS THING

02:44:01.998 --> 02:44:03.200
HAPPEN.

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:04.467
BUT AT ONE POINT IN THE HEARING

02:44:04.534 --> 02:44:05.769
I AGREE WITH OTHER MEMBERS THAT

02:44:05.835 --> 02:44:07.070
WE SHOULD NOT TRY TO RE WRITE

02:44:07.137 --> 02:44:08.371
THE BILL IN THE HEARING.

02:44:08.438 --> 02:44:09.973
AND THERE WAS A CLEAR PATH TO

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:11.441
AMENDING THE BILL IN HAVE THE

02:44:11.508 --> 02:44:13.109
PROPER AGENCY CONDUCT THE REVIEW

02:44:13.176 --> 02:44:15.445
OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT --

02:44:15.512 --> 02:44:18.348
WAS A WATER RESOURCES -- WAS

02:44:18.415 --> 02:44:22.219
ADDED -- I THINK THE IDEA THOUGH.

02:44:22.285 --> 02:44:23.887
WITHOUT AMENDMENTS AND I THINK.

02:44:23.954 --> 02:44:25.822
FOLKS WERE WERE APPRECIATIVE

02:44:25.889 --> 02:44:27.624
THAT WAS INCLUDED.

02:44:27.691 --> 02:44:28.692
BUT IT WENT BACK TO THE FACT

02:44:28.758 --> 02:44:30.493
THAT WE STILL DIDN'T WANT TO GO

02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:32.095
THROUGH OR THE ENTITIES DID NOT

02:44:32.162 --> 02:44:33.697
WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS

02:44:33.763 --> 02:44:36.166
AGAIN SEE WHAT ONCE.

02:44:36.233 --> 02:44:39.903
DOES NOT MEAN SEE QUIRK INFINITY --

02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:41.504
AND I THINK THAT'S WERE ADD.

02:44:41.571 --> 02:44:43.506
I IT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE

02:44:43.573 --> 02:44:45.575
VOTES ARE ON THIS TODAY AND I

02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:48.044
KNOW IT'S A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE --

02:44:48.111 --> 02:44:49.846
IN A PERFECT WORLD I'D LOVE TO

02:44:49.913 --> 02:44:52.582
SEE THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUE.

02:44:52.649 --> 02:44:54.618
I DON'T WISH THAT PROBABLY ON MY

02:44:54.684 --> 02:44:56.853
WORST ENEMY HOWEVER.

02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:58.588
SO -- SO SENATOR I I KNOW THAT

02:44:58.655 --> 02:44:59.789
YOU'VE -- PUT IN A GOOD AMOUNT A

02:44:59.856 --> 02:45:01.191
LEG WORK ON THIS AND I DON'T

02:45:01.258 --> 02:45:02.359
KNOW WE'RE THE MEETING OF THE

02:45:02.425 --> 02:45:03.893
MINDS CAN OCCUR.

02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:05.528
I'M JUST OF THE OPINION THAT I

02:45:05.595 --> 02:45:07.297
DON'T THINK WE'RE DONE.

02:45:07.364 --> 02:45:09.532
BUT IN ITS CURRENT FORM I HAVE

02:45:09.599 --> 02:45:10.500
TO HONOR SOME OF THE INITIAL

02:45:10.567 --> 02:45:11.568
REQUEST BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY

02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:12.702
WERE REASONABLE.

02:45:12.769 --> 02:45:14.004
THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXTENSIVE AND

02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:15.338
FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL

02:45:15.405 --> 02:45:17.841
RESPECTFULLY OF VOTE AGAINST THE

02:45:17.907 --> 02:45:18.775
BILL IN SH.

02:45:18.842 --> 02:45:21.278
AND IF IT SHOULD IT PASS -- THEN

02:45:21.344 --> 02:45:22.612
I'M HOPING THAT THERE WILL BE A

02:45:22.679 --> 02:45:26.349
REITERATION IN THE SECOND HOUSE --

02:45:26.416 --> 02:45:26.950
BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN

02:45:27.017 --> 02:45:28.184
THIS PROCESS.

02:45:28.251 --> 02:45:30.320
SENATOR SKINNER.

02:45:30.387 --> 02:45:33.423
THANK YOU -- THAT A PRESIDENT

02:45:33.490 --> 02:45:34.324

02:45:34.391 --> 02:45:36.026
THIS BILL.

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:38.495
AND IF FOR ME IT IS NOT A

02:45:38.561 --> 02:45:39.963
DIFFICULT BILLER CONTROVERSIAL

02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:44.834
BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THAT.

02:45:44.901 --> 02:45:48.004
ONCE THE PLEADED ONCE WE REMOVE

02:45:48.071 --> 02:45:50.006
FOR GROUND WATER THEN THE

02:45:50.073 --> 02:45:50.240
AQUIFER.

02:45:50.307 --> 02:45:51.374
CAN [inaudible]

02:45:51.441 --> 02:45:53.677
RESTORE.

02:45:53.743 --> 02:45:54.678
IT IS PRETTY MUCH THE

02:45:54.744 --> 02:45:56.613
IRREVERSIBLE.

02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:58.148
AND I THINK FOR THOSE OF US WHO

02:45:58.214 --> 02:45:59.249
TRAVELED ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD

02:45:59.316 --> 02:46:01.184
OR EVEN JUST TRAVELED IN THE

02:46:01.251 --> 02:46:02.252
SOUTHWEST STATES.

02:46:02.319 --> 02:46:04.054
WHEN YOU VISIT THE VARIOUS

02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:05.755
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES YOU SEE

02:46:05.822 --> 02:46:06.723
THAT THEY WERE THRIVING

02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:08.591
CIVILIZATIONS AND THEN THEY PUT

02:46:08.658 --> 02:46:10.493
THE EXPLANATION OF WHAT THE?

02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:11.594
WHAT THE?

02:46:11.661 --> 02:46:13.897
SCIENTISTS AND OTHERS ARE

02:46:13.963 --> 02:46:15.098
ANTHROPOLOGISTS AND SUCH YOU

02:46:15.165 --> 02:46:16.566
STARTED THE SITE.

02:46:16.633 --> 02:46:17.534
DETERMINE WHAT YOU KNOW WHY DO

02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:19.636
THESE PEOPLE LEAVE WHY DID THIS --

02:46:19.703 --> 02:46:22.472
THRIVING COMMUNITY NO LONGER

02:46:22.539 --> 02:46:24.140
EXIST AND USUALLY THE

02:46:24.207 --> 02:46:26.042
EXPLANATION IS DEPLETION OF

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:29.646
GROUNDWATER IS A WATER ISSUE.

02:46:29.713 --> 02:46:31.081
NOW CALIFORNIA DID NOT MEASURE

02:46:31.147 --> 02:46:32.816
OR MONITOR IT'S GROUND WATER FOR

02:46:32.882 --> 02:46:33.883
YEARS.

02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:36.686
WE DID NOT TAKE ACTION. TO

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:37.987
EITHER MEASURE OR MONITOR OR

02:46:38.054 --> 02:46:39.522
LIMIT.

02:46:39.589 --> 02:46:41.224
THE DEPLETION OF GROUND WATER

02:46:41.291 --> 02:46:43.526
UNTIL.

02:46:43.593 --> 02:46:45.128
TWENTY FIFTEEN I WOULD ENCOURAGE

02:46:45.195 --> 02:46:47.464
ANY MEMBERS WHO ARE THINK THAT

02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:50.166
PERHAPS OR GROUND WATER.

02:46:50.233 --> 02:46:52.836
NOT ONLY IN THIS AREA OF MOJAVE

02:46:52.902 --> 02:46:54.738
MIGHT BE AT RISK BUT ACROSS THE

02:46:54.804 --> 02:46:57.474
STATE TO LOOK AT STANFORD.

02:46:57.540 --> 02:46:59.242
UNIVERSITY WEBSITE WHERE THEY

02:46:59.309 --> 02:47:01.144
SHOW A SERIES OF NASA

02:47:01.211 --> 02:47:03.580
PHOTOGRAPHS SATELLITE IMAGES

02:47:03.646 --> 02:47:05.648
USING INFRARED TECHNOLOGY.

02:47:05.715 --> 02:47:07.283
WHICH SHOW THE STATUS FOR GROUND

02:47:07.350 --> 02:47:09.085
WATER.

02:47:09.152 --> 02:47:10.453
ACROSS THE STATE.

02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:12.589
FIRST IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND AND

02:47:12.655 --> 02:47:14.557
TWO THEN JUNE TWO THOUSAND AND

02:47:14.624 --> 02:47:17.026
EIGHT AND THEN JUNE.

02:47:17.093 --> 02:47:18.461
TWENTY FOURTEEN IN JUNE TWENTY

02:47:18.528 --> 02:47:19.863
FOURTEEN PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE

02:47:19.929 --> 02:47:22.132
AREAS THAT HAD BEEN GREEN GREEN

02:47:22.198 --> 02:47:24.434
SHOWING THAT THERE WAS.

02:47:24.501 --> 02:47:25.902
A AT LEAST SOME GOOD.

02:47:25.969 --> 02:47:27.804
RESERVE WHETHER IT WAS ADEQUATE

02:47:27.871 --> 02:47:29.873
OR NOT IS ANOTHER STORY.

02:47:29.939 --> 02:47:31.775
THAT ENTIRE MAP IS READ.

02:47:31.841 --> 02:47:34.010
NOW WE KNOW ALSO THAT THAT WAS

02:47:34.077 --> 02:47:37.680
AT THE HEIGHT OF OUR VERY LONG

02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:38.848
DROUGHT.

02:47:38.915 --> 02:47:41.317
BUT IN THE MOST RECENT INFRARED

02:47:41.384 --> 02:47:44.087
IMAGES IT ONCE AGAIN.

02:47:44.154 --> 02:47:47.357
SHOWS MOST OF THAT AREA AS READ

02:47:47.424 --> 02:47:48.358
AND WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING THE

02:47:48.425 --> 02:47:50.160
MOJAVE.

02:47:50.226 --> 02:47:50.994
SO.

02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:53.062
IT TO KNOW THAT AN AREA LIKE THE

02:47:53.129 --> 02:47:55.698
MOJAVE THAT IS ONE OF OUR MOST

02:47:55.765 --> 02:47:58.201
RESTRICTED AREAS IN TERMS OF

02:47:58.268 --> 02:47:59.569
RAINFALL AND RUN OFF SO THE

02:47:59.636 --> 02:48:02.272
LEAST ABLE. TO RESTORE ITS

02:48:02.338 --> 02:48:03.673
AQUIFER.

02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:05.375
THAT WE WOULD AT THIS TIME.

02:48:05.442 --> 02:48:08.144
NOT SUPPORT A BILL LIKE THIS

02:48:08.211 --> 02:48:10.613
THAT JUST ALLOWS OUR SCIENTISTS

02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:12.215
TO COME BACK TOGETHER.

02:48:12.282 --> 02:48:14.617
AND LOOKED AT WHAT IS THE REAL

02:48:14.684 --> 02:48:17.053
STATUS OF THE AQUIFER AND WHAT

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:19.756
CAN IT REALLY BE SUSTAINED IN

02:48:19.823 --> 02:48:22.025
TERMS OF THE AMOUNT THAT COULD

02:48:22.091 --> 02:48:24.260
BE PUMPED OUT OF IT.

02:48:24.327 --> 02:48:24.894
AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE

02:48:24.961 --> 02:48:27.630
VOTE [inaudible]

02:48:27.697 --> 02:48:32.402
SENATOR WIENER.

02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:33.970

02:48:34.037 --> 02:48:35.638
ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE

02:48:35.705 --> 02:48:38.808
OF SEVEN WHICH WILL PROTECT OUR

02:48:38.875 --> 02:48:40.944
DESERT'S FROM TENSELY

02:48:41.010 --> 02:48:42.145
UNSUSTAINABLE.

02:48:42.212 --> 02:48:43.446
PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER WITHOUT

02:48:43.513 --> 02:48:46.549
ADEQUATE ANALYSIS A REVIEW.

02:48:46.616 --> 02:48:48.351
I CALIFORNIAS DESERT SO SOME OF

02:48:48.418 --> 02:48:50.119

THE WORLD.

02:48:51.287 --> 02:48:52.856

AND DEMOCRATS FROM ROSES.

02:48:58.394 --> 02:49:00.063
I THESE REGIONS ARE ALSO HOME TO

02:49:00.129 --> 02:49:01.998
SOME OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED

02:49:02.065 --> 02:49:03.633
COMMUNITIES AND OUR STATE. FOR

02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:05.335
HOME A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN WATER

02:49:05.401 --> 02:49:09.906
TABLES COULD PROVE DISASTROUS.

02:49:09.973 --> 02:49:10.807
BY THIS LEGISLATION SIMPLY

02:49:10.874 --> 02:49:11.341
FORCES THE STATE TO TAKE A

02:49:11.407 --> 02:49:14.310
CLOSER LOOK AT THE REAL IMPACTS

02:49:14.377 --> 02:49:15.979
OF THE PROPOSED GROUNDWATER

02:49:16.045 --> 02:49:17.013
EXTRACTION.

02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:18.648

MY DISTRICT -- I REALLY DO

02:49:44.307 --> 02:49:45.041
APPRECIATE THE DEBATE ON THE

02:49:45.108 --> 02:49:47.110
FLOOR MOJAVE DESERT THE KIDDIES

PROJECT THE DISEASE ITSELF THE

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:51.014
RESIDENTS THE MOJAVE.

02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:52.315
DESERT THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:49:52.382 --> 02:49:55.218
COMMUNITY THEY ALL BELONG TO THE

02:49:55.285 --> 02:49:56.586
SIXTEENTH SENATE DISTRICT.

02:49:56.653 --> 02:49:58.955

KERN COUNTY HAS ALREADY APPROVED

02:50:02.926 --> 02:50:05.228
A SIGNAL PLAN WHICH WAS PASSED.

02:50:05.295 --> 02:50:07.096
WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE SCIENCE

02:50:07.163 --> 02:50:08.631
SHOWS THAT THE SPACE AND IS AN

02:50:08.698 --> 02:50:11.401
OPEN BASIN AND WILL BE RECHARGED.

02:50:11.467 --> 02:50:13.303
KIDDIES THE CLIENT IN THE

CONSTITUENT IN MY DISTRICT THAT

02:50:14.938 --> 02:50:17.273
IS WHEN HE DOING THIS PROJECT.

02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:20.043
HAS THE DELAY IN THE PROJECT

02:50:20.109 --> 02:50:22.011

WATER IF IT'S NEEDED ESPECIALLY

02:50:32.655 --> 02:50:34.090
WHEN IF WE GO INTO WATER

02:50:34.157 --> 02:50:35.858
RATIONING AT FIFTY FIVE GALLONS

02:50:35.925 --> 02:50:37.260

THIS COMPANY WHO IS DOING THIS --

02:50:39.929 --> 02:50:41.130
THE REASON WHY IT'S TAKEN SO

02:50:41.197 --> 02:50:42.632
LONG IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN

02:50:42.699 --> 02:50:45.068
IN COURT FIGHTING LAWSUIT AFTER

02:50:45.134 --> 02:50:49.072

EXTRACTION AND THEY HAVE BEEN TO

02:50:58.715 --> 02:51:01.217
OVER BACKWARDS THEY HAVE ONE

IDEA TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE

02:51:13.062 --> 02:51:14.397
LEGISLATURE TO HOPEFULLY.

02:51:14.464 --> 02:51:16.699
OVERRULED WITH THE COURT SYSTEM

02:51:16.766 --> 02:51:17.700

AGAIN COLLEAGUES THIS IS IN MY

02:51:19.869 --> 02:51:20.837

02:51:20.903 --> 02:51:22.972
THIS COMPANY HAS GONE ABOVE AND

02:51:23.039 --> 02:51:25.475
BEYOND SCIENCE SHOWS THAT IS AN

02:51:25.541 --> 02:51:27.343
OPEN BASIN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN

02:51:27.410 --> 02:51:28.778
MY DISTRICT ON BOTH SIDES OF

02:51:28.845 --> 02:51:30.913
THIS ISSUE WE WANT TO RESET WE

02:51:30.980 --> 02:51:32.548
WANT TO PROTECT THE MOJAVE

02:51:32.615 --> 02:51:34.417
DESERT -- TO MAKE SURE IT IS

02:51:34.484 --> 02:51:36.152
STILL ONE OF THE MOST PRISTINE

02:51:36.219 --> 02:51:38.488
AREAS IN OUR DISTRICT THAT

02:51:38.554 --> 02:51:40.590
PEOPLE CAN GO TO BUT WE ALSO

02:51:40.657 --> 02:51:41.758
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:51:41.824 --> 02:51:42.992
PROVIDE WATER TO THE

02:51:43.059 --> 02:51:45.094
CONSTITUENTS THIS TO THE SOUTH

02:51:45.161 --> 02:51:45.695
OF US.

02:51:45.762 --> 02:51:47.463
AND AGAIN THINK ABOUT THAT FOR

02:51:47.530 --> 02:51:52.669
JUST SICK MAN WE'RE NOT GONNA

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:54.537
HAVE A BASE AN OVERDRAFT THE

02:51:54.604 --> 02:51:56.539
MOHAVE BASIN IS INCLUDED IN THE

02:51:56.606 --> 02:51:58.007
SIGMA PROJECT.

02:51:58.074 --> 02:52:00.710
AND TWELVE LAWSUITS IN OVER A

02:52:00.777 --> 02:52:03.379
DECADE LATER.

02:52:03.446 --> 02:52:05.515
THEY HAVE LOST EVERY SINGLE

02:52:05.581 --> 02:52:07.350
LAWSUIT AND THEY COME TO THE

02:52:07.417 --> 02:52:09.118
CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TOO

02:52:09.185 --> 02:52:11.554
AGAIN IMPACT MY DISTRICT IN THIS

02:52:11.621 --> 02:52:12.822
PROJECT IS GONNA.

02:52:12.889 --> 02:52:15.224
A PROVIDE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND

02:52:15.291 --> 02:52:16.993
JOBS.

02:52:17.060 --> 02:52:18.961
WE TOOK -- WE TAKE A VOTE THE

02:52:19.028 --> 02:52:19.696
OTHER DAY ON THE FLOOR THAT

02:52:19.762 --> 02:52:22.031
ELIMINATES -- OUR CITIES FROM

02:52:22.098 --> 02:52:23.833
BRINGING IN FACTORIES WHERE WE

02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:24.467
HAVE.

02:52:24.534 --> 02:52:26.536
OR WAREHOUSES WHERE WE HAVE

02:52:26.602 --> 02:52:28.271
PLACES TO BE ABLE TO BUILD

02:52:28.337 --> 02:52:29.739
BECAUSE WE ON A LOT OF LAND --

02:52:29.806 --> 02:52:31.941
BUT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT

02:52:32.008 --> 02:52:33.643
THE COLD CALIFORNIA STATE A

02:52:33.710 --> 02:52:35.278
TAXPAYERS PAYING FOR A RE A

02:52:35.344 --> 02:52:37.280
MANUFACTURER'S CREDITOR RESEARCH

APPLE PAYS WHAT POINT 0003% OF

02:52:40.283 --> 02:52:41.517
ANY TAX RATE.

02:52:41.584 --> 02:52:43.686
SO IT'S IN THE VALLEY THE VALLEY

02:52:43.753 --> 02:52:45.788
IS CONSTANTLY CHORE CHANGED AND

02:52:45.855 --> 02:52:47.390
THIS IS ANOTHER WAY THAT THIS

02:52:47.457 --> 02:52:48.858
LEGISLATURE'S COMING INTO MY

02:52:48.925 --> 02:52:51.461
DISTRICT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:52:51.527 --> 02:52:53.129
AND TRYING TO TAKE JOBS WHEN WE

02:52:53.196 --> 02:52:54.464

COMPLY WITH EVERY STATE LAW THAT

02:52:56.899 --> 02:52:58.367
COMES OUT OF THIS BUILDING.

02:52:58.434 --> 02:53:01.037
SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO NOT VOTE

02:53:01.104 --> 02:53:03.506
FOR THIS BILL SAVE THE SIX

02:53:03.573 --> 02:53:05.041

OF THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE I

02:55:02.725 --> 02:55:03.726

THE OFFER SITTING ON THE TABLE.

02:55:20.543 --> 02:55:22.445

BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL

02:55:29.852 --> 02:55:32.121
SUBSTANCE OF THIS MEASURE.

WE HOPE THAT PEOPLE USE THESE

03:17:54.762 --> 03:17:56.564

EXCESSIVELY MANAGEABLE --

03:18:05.006 --> 03:18:07.008

03:33:31.865 --> 03:33:32.633
TREATMENT.

03:33:32.699 --> 03:33:35.736
OR IN PERPETUITY IS IT SIGNED

03:33:35.802 --> 03:33:37.371
ITS PRIOR TO TREATMENT.

03:33:37.437 --> 03:33:38.472
BUT AFTER BUT AFTER THE

03:33:38.539 --> 03:33:40.874
TREATMENT IT IS THEN BECOME THE

03:33:40.941 --> 03:33:44.077
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OF THE

03:33:44.144 --> 03:33:45.512
INSURANCE CARRIER OR THE

03:33:45.579 --> 03:33:47.281
INDIVIDUAL TO MAINTAIN THOSE

03:33:47.347 --> 03:33:47.881
EGGS.

03:33:47.948 --> 03:33:49.683
IN A FROZEN STATE I THINK THERE

03:33:49.750 --> 03:33:50.684
ONCE THEY'RE HARVARD AND THEIR

03:33:50.751 --> 03:33:53.520
FROZEN I I ACTUALLY HAVE. TO TO

03:33:53.587 --> 03:33:54.354
BE HONEST WITH YOU DON'T KNOW

03:33:54.421 --> 03:33:56.256
LONG DON'T KNOW THE LONGEVITY OF

03:33:56.323 --> 03:33:58.725
THAT COMMITMENT BUT TYPICALLY

03:33:58.792 --> 03:34:00.928
WHOEVER HARBORS SCHISM.

03:34:00.994 --> 03:34:02.362
THE HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE

03:34:02.429 --> 03:34:04.498
CRYOGENIC LABORATORY TO FREEZE

03:34:04.565 --> 03:34:06.500
THEM AND STORE THEM AS PART OF

03:34:06.567 --> 03:34:08.001
THAT TREATMENT SO I THINK IT'S A

03:34:08.068 --> 03:34:09.803
BUILT IN COST. FOR A FULL

03:34:09.870 --> 03:34:12.072
SERVICE FERTILITY PRESERVATION.

03:34:12.139 --> 03:34:13.707
THAT I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT

03:34:13.774 --> 03:34:16.977
TO FIND OUT -- THIS HITS HOME

03:34:17.044 --> 03:34:20.180
FOR ME ON A VERY PERSONAL LEVEL --

03:34:20.247 --> 03:34:21.348
FOR A COUPLE YEARS MY WIFE WENT

03:34:21.415 --> 03:34:25.786
THROUGH -- SHE WENT THROUGH A

03:34:25.852 --> 03:34:26.520
LOT OF TREATMENT [inaudible]

03:34:26.587 --> 03:34:30.591
AND THIS ISSUE CAME UP.

03:34:30.657 --> 03:34:32.960
AND IT ADDED INSULT TO THAT

03:34:33.026 --> 03:34:35.329
INJURY.

03:34:35.395 --> 03:34:37.831
AND I THINK I I HAVE SOME ISSUES

03:34:37.898 --> 03:34:40.200
ON A POLICY LEVEL I DON'T KNOW

03:34:40.267 --> 03:34:40.434
EXACTLY.

03:34:40.500 --> 03:34:42.202
WHERE?

03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:43.370
EVERYTHING PLAYS OUT WITH THIS

03:34:43.437 --> 03:34:44.671
LEGISLATION.

03:34:44.738 --> 03:34:45.939
BUT I THINK THE ABILITY TO

03:34:46.006 --> 03:34:49.243
PRESERVE A WOMAN'S RIGHT -- OF

03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:50.510

03:34:56.283 --> 03:34:57.851
EXPERIENCE.

03:34:57.918 --> 03:35:00.287
THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A

03:35:00.354 --> 03:35:05.459
COMPONENT OF THAT SERVICE.

03:35:05.525 --> 03:35:08.462

THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING

03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:25.212
WE HAVE ISSUES WITH BILLS THAT

03:35:25.279 --> 03:35:26.013

03:35:31.251 --> 03:35:33.654
OF THE WORST DIAGNOSES AT A A

03:35:33.720 --> 03:35:35.322
MAN OR A YOUNG MAN WOULD LIKE TO

CERVICAL CANCER OVARIAN CANCER.

03:35:42.996 --> 03:35:44.765
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

03:35:44.831 --> 03:35:46.600
IT ALLOWS SOMEONE THAT GETS THIS

03:35:46.667 --> 03:35:48.068

A HYSTERECTOMY.

03:35:58.278 --> 03:35:59.446
OR HAS TO UNDERGO SOME

03:35:59.513 --> 03:36:00.847
CHEMOTHERAPY THAT CAN CAUSE SOME

03:36:00.914 --> 03:36:03.717
LONG TERM DAMAGE TO THESE ORGANS.

03:36:03.784 --> 03:36:05.319
PRIOR TO INITIATING THE THIRD

03:36:05.385 --> 03:36:08.822
THE SURGERY OR THE CHEMOTHERAPY.

03:36:08.889 --> 03:36:11.258
ONE CAN PRESERVE THEIR SPERM OR

03:36:11.325 --> 03:36:12.826
THEIR AEGS.

03:36:12.893 --> 03:36:15.062
SO THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

03:36:15.128 --> 03:36:16.363
TO BE A PARENT.

03:36:16.430 --> 03:36:18.799
IN THE FUTURE.

03:36:18.865 --> 03:36:21.435
THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS

03:36:21.501 --> 03:36:21.735
[inaudible]

03:36:21.802 --> 03:36:24.538
WAY OF PRESERVING THE SPERM ARE

03:36:24.604 --> 03:36:26.340
THE AGES IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE

03:36:26.406 --> 03:36:29.076
AND WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE

03:36:29.142 --> 03:36:29.876
INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULDN'T

03:36:29.943 --> 03:36:30.477
WANT.

03:36:30.544 --> 03:36:32.212
TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE IN A

03:36:32.279 --> 03:36:34.348
CERTAINLY OUT OF THE ROOM -- FOR

03:36:34.414 --> 03:36:36.416

03:36:36.483 --> 03:36:38.518
COUPLES FOR THAT MATTER TO PAY

03:36:38.585 --> 03:36:39.519
FOR THE SERVICES.

03:36:39.586 --> 03:36:42.889
IT'S A VERY NARROW WINDOW OF

03:36:42.956 --> 03:36:44.925
OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WILL TO ALLOW

03:36:44.991 --> 03:36:47.461

OF BEING A PARENT OF A CHILD.

03:36:51.865 --> 03:36:53.800
THIS LEGISLATION WILL ALLOW

03:36:53.867 --> 03:36:55.068
THOSE COUPLES THAT HAVE ALREADY

03:36:55.135 --> 03:36:57.371
HAVE THE ODDS STACKED AGAINST

03:36:57.437 --> 03:36:59.106

03:36:59.172 --> 03:37:02.809

04:17:51.889 --> 04:17:53.858
SENATOR WIENER I THANK YOU VERY

04:17:53.925 --> 04:17:54.492
MUCH FOR A PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES

04:17:54.559 --> 04:17:57.228
SB TWENTY THREE CLARIFIES -- THE

04:17:57.295 --> 04:17:59.730
FORCIBLE UNLAWFUL ENTRY OF A

04:17:59.797 --> 04:18:01.833
VEHICLE INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE

04:18:01.899 --> 04:18:03.801
PASSING OUT THE WINDOW.

04:18:03.868 --> 04:18:05.269
IS IN FACT AUTO BURGLARY.

04:18:05.336 --> 04:18:07.004
THIS NARROW CHANGE MEANS THAT

04:18:07.071 --> 04:18:09.006
BREAKING A WINDOW OF A VEHICLE

04:18:09.073 --> 04:18:11.409
BY USE OF IT AS A FORM OF

04:18:11.475 --> 04:18:13.211
FORCIBLE ENTRY WITH THE INTENT

04:18:13.277 --> 04:18:15.079
TO STEAL SOMETHING INSIDE THE

04:18:15.146 --> 04:18:17.348
VEHICLE.

04:18:17.415 --> 04:18:19.016
AMOUNTS TO AN AUTO BURGLARY.

04:18:19.083 --> 04:18:20.418
UNDER CURRENT LAW -- THERE'S A

04:18:20.484 --> 04:18:22.386
QUIRK OR FRANKLY A LOOPHOLE --

04:18:22.453 --> 04:18:24.322
DIE IN ORDER TO PROVE IN AUTUMN

04:18:24.388 --> 04:18:26.257
BURKE WHERE YOU HAVE TO PROVE.

04:18:26.324 --> 04:18:27.625
THAT THE VEHICLE WAS LOCKED

04:18:27.692 --> 04:18:29.694
WHICH IS OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DO

04:18:29.760 --> 04:18:31.829
FOR EXAMPLE IF WITH A RENTAL CAR

04:18:31.896 --> 04:18:32.964
AT THE TOURIST HAS LEFT.

04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:35.032
OR IF SOMEONE DOES NOT REMEMBER

04:18:35.099 --> 04:18:36.367
WHETHER THEY LOCK THEIR CAR --

04:18:36.434 --> 04:18:37.869
AND YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE

04:18:37.935 --> 04:18:39.670
DOOR WAS LOCKED EVEN IF YOU HAVE

04:18:39.737 --> 04:18:42.273
ON VIDEO SOMEONE PASSING IN THE

04:18:42.340 --> 04:18:43.674
WINDOW TO GET INTO THE CAR.

04:18:43.741 --> 04:18:45.843
SO YOU CAN LOSE A PROSECUTION

04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:48.112
HAVING SOMEONE ON VIDEO PASSING

04:18:48.179 --> 04:18:50.214
THE WINDOW TO GET INTO THE CAR

04:18:50.281 --> 04:18:52.216
IF YOU'RE UNABLE TO PROVE BEYOND

04:18:52.283 --> 04:18:54.185
A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT.

04:18:54.252 --> 04:18:54.986
THE CAR WAS ALSO LAW.

04:18:55.052 --> 04:18:56.787

AUTHORIZE PHARMACISTS WITHOUT A

04:33:00.497 --> 04:33:01.565
PHYSICIAN'S.

04:33:01.631 --> 04:33:05.168
PRESCRIPTION TO PROVIDE THE FULL

04:33:05.235 --> 04:33:06.837
TWENTY EIGHT DAY COURSE OF PAP --

POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS AND

04:33:08.672 --> 04:33:11.842
THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS OF CRAP.

04:33:11.908 --> 04:33:12.909
AFTER THIRTY DAYS SOMEONE WILL

04:33:12.976 --> 04:33:14.544
THEN HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

04:33:14.611 --> 04:33:15.779
THE BLOOD WORK AND GO SEE A

04:33:15.846 --> 04:33:18.248
POSITION TO CONTINUE.

04:33:18.315 --> 04:33:20.250
BOB THIS WILL HELP GET PEOPLE

04:33:20.317 --> 04:33:22.385
ACCESS EASIER AND GET PEOPLE

04:33:22.452 --> 04:33:24.588
GOING MORE EASILY -- WE WORKED

04:33:24.654 --> 04:33:27.023
EXTENSIVELY WITH -- THE BUSINESS

04:33:27.090 --> 04:33:28.792
AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE AND

04:33:28.859 --> 04:33:29.493
WITH THE HEALTH COMMITTEE ON

04:33:29.559 --> 04:33:30.961
THIS BILL AND I THINK WE'VE COME

04:33:31.027 --> 04:33:33.597
TO A GOOD STRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE

04:33:33.663 --> 04:33:34.464
THAT WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE'S

04:33:34.531 --> 04:33:35.499
HEALTH.

04:33:35.565 --> 04:33:37.367
AND EXPANDING ACCESS THE OTHER

04:33:37.434 --> 04:33:41.171
PIECE OF THIS BILL IS -- SP ONE

04:33:41.238 --> 04:33:41.938
FIFTY NINE PROHIBITS BY

04:33:42.005 --> 04:33:42.873
INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM

04:33:42.939 --> 04:33:46.143
REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS

04:33:46.209 --> 04:33:46.910
TO ACCESS PROP AND PAP.

04:33:46.977 --> 04:33:49.012
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO BASIS TO

04:33:49.079 --> 04:33:51.782
HAVE A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND

04:33:51.848 --> 04:33:53.183
IS SIMPLY THE LAYS ACCESS --

04:33:53.250 --> 04:33:54.651
THERE'VE BEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE

04:33:54.718 --> 04:33:56.853
BECOME HIV POSITIVE BECAUSE OF

04:33:56.920 --> 04:33:59.322
THESE DELAYS -- AND IT'S NOT

04:33:59.389 --> 04:34:01.124
ACCEPTABLE -- SO COLLEAGUES WE

04:34:01.191 --> 04:34:02.826
HAVE A BROAD COALITION BEHIND

04:34:02.893 --> 04:34:08.899
THIS BILL OF HEALTH CARE

04:34:08.965 --> 04:34:11.301
PROFESSIONALS IT THE ODD BECAUSE

04:34:11.368 --> 04:34:12.469
LGBT CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS

04:34:12.536 --> 04:34:13.970
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

04:34:14.037 --> 04:34:14.604
AYE VOTE.

04:34:14.671 --> 04:34:15.705
ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR

04:34:15.772 --> 04:34:18.275
STONE.

04:34:18.341 --> 04:34:19.009
THINK ABOUT PRESIDENT -- I RISE

04:34:19.075 --> 04:34:19.676
IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FIFTY NINE

04:34:19.743 --> 04:34:20.677
WHICH I THINK MAYBE ONE OF THE

04:34:20.744 --> 04:34:21.945
MOST IMPORTANT BILLS THAT WE'RE

04:34:22.012 --> 04:34:23.480
GOING TO BE ENTERTAINED THIS THE

04:34:23.547 --> 04:34:24.381
SESSION.

04:34:24.447 --> 04:34:26.416
THE BILL INCREASES ACCESSIBILITY

04:34:26.483 --> 04:34:28.351
TO PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE THE

04:34:28.418 --> 04:34:32.989
FIGHT THE SPREAD OF HIV AND AIDS.

04:34:33.056 --> 04:34:34.558
IN ADDITION IT REMOVES BARRIERS

04:34:34.624 --> 04:34:36.126
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS

04:34:36.193 --> 04:34:37.794
SEEKING TIMELY ACCESS TO PASS.

04:34:37.861 --> 04:34:39.162
BY ALLOWING PHARMACISTS TO

04:34:39.229 --> 04:34:41.398
PROVIDE THE HIV PRE EXPOSURE

04:34:41.465 --> 04:34:42.399
PROPHYLAXIS TO PREP.

04:34:42.465 --> 04:34:43.800
AND POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS

04:34:43.867 --> 04:34:46.870
PAP [inaudible] TWO PATIENTS.

04:34:46.937 --> 04:34:48.171
IT'S NOT A MERE MYTH BUT A

04:34:48.238 --> 04:34:49.806
SIMPLE FACT THAT INCREASING

04:34:49.873 --> 04:34:51.875
ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE

04:34:51.942 --> 04:34:54.211
GREATLY FIGHTS THE SPREAD.

04:34:54.277 --> 04:34:55.278
OF HIV AND AIDS.

04:34:55.345 --> 04:34:57.013
SO BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES

04:34:57.080 --> 04:34:58.248
IS TWO THINGS.

04:34:58.315 --> 04:34:59.182
IT ALLOWS FOR GREATER

04:34:59.249 --> 04:35:00.984
ACCESSIBILITY FOR PATIENTS THAT

04:35:01.051 --> 04:35:03.954
NEED THE ACUTE TREATMENT OF CRAP.

04:35:04.020 --> 04:35:06.823
BY GOING TO ONE OF FIVE THOUSAND

04:35:06.890 --> 04:35:08.191
PHARMACY IS A CHOOSE TO

04:35:08.258 --> 04:35:09.259
PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE OF

04:35:09.326 --> 04:35:10.327
CALIFORNIA [inaudible]

04:35:10.393 --> 04:35:13.730
AND TO IT STOPS THE PRIOR

04:35:13.797 --> 04:35:14.998
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS IS

04:35:15.065 --> 04:35:18.068
SOMETIMES CAN DRAG ON FOR DAYS.

04:35:18.134 --> 04:35:19.536
BUT IS VERY IMPORTANT IF THESE

04:35:19.603 --> 04:35:21.371
DRUGS ARE GOING TO WORK THEY

04:35:21.438 --> 04:35:23.473
HAVE TO BE TAKE TAKEN IN A VERY

04:35:23.540 --> 04:35:24.441
TIMELY WAY.

04:35:24.507 --> 04:35:26.443
THAT'S LESS THAN SEVENTY TWO

04:35:26.509 --> 04:35:28.745
HOURS FOR THE DRUGS SIMPLY DO

04:35:28.812 --> 04:35:31.147
NOT WORK.

04:35:31.214 --> 04:35:33.083
WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR MY DOCTOR

04:35:33.149 --> 04:35:34.784
PHARMACY DEGREE U. S. C.?

04:35:34.851 --> 04:35:36.019
I ACTUALLY DID ROUNDS WITH

04:35:36.086 --> 04:35:37.287
PHYSICIANS AT THE COUNTY USC

04:35:37.354 --> 04:35:39.055
HOSPITAL.

04:35:39.122 --> 04:35:40.190
WE OFTEN TOOK MANY THE SAME

04:35:40.257 --> 04:35:43.193
CLASSES TOGETHER -- AT WITH

04:35:43.260 --> 04:35:44.661
MEDICAL STUDENTS SUCH AS ANATOMY

04:35:44.728 --> 04:35:46.630
HISTOLOGY PHYSIOLOGY

04:35:46.696 --> 04:35:48.198
PHARMACOLOGY BY MEDICINAL

04:35:48.265 --> 04:35:49.966
CHEMISTRY.

04:35:50.033 --> 04:35:52.335
IT IS NOT A UNIQUE IDEA THE

04:35:52.402 --> 04:35:53.737
PHARMACISTS ARE ABLE TO

04:35:53.803 --> 04:35:55.872
ADMINISTER MEDICATION THE FACT

04:35:55.939 --> 04:35:58.441
IS MOST OF YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET

04:35:58.508 --> 04:35:59.843
IMMUNIZED TO JUST ABOUT.

04:35:59.910 --> 04:36:01.211
ANY PHARMACY IN THE TATE OF

04:36:01.278 --> 04:36:03.046
CALIFORNIA THAT AS PHARMACISTS

04:36:03.113 --> 04:36:04.648
THAT ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED. TO

04:36:04.714 --> 04:36:05.582
DO SO.

04:36:05.649 --> 04:36:08.018
AND WITH THAT WE OF INCREASE THE

04:36:08.084 --> 04:36:10.654
THE HERD -- IMMUNIZATION RATE --

04:36:10.720 --> 04:36:13.590
PROTECTING OUR OUR COMMUNITIES.

04:36:13.657 --> 04:36:14.691
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH

04:36:14.758 --> 04:36:16.660
THE PASSAGE OF SB FOUR NINETY

04:36:16.726 --> 04:36:18.194
THREE WE CODIFIED INTO LAW.

04:36:18.261 --> 04:36:20.163
THE PHARMACISTS ARE MODIFIED

04:36:20.230 --> 04:36:21.765
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THUS WE

04:36:21.831 --> 04:36:23.166
PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE.

04:36:23.233 --> 04:36:24.401
IN THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE

04:36:24.467 --> 04:36:26.069
FOR PATIENTS.

04:36:26.136 --> 04:36:27.771
AS I MENTIONED IS OVER FIVE

04:36:27.837 --> 04:36:28.905
THOUSAND PHARMACIES AND CITY

04:36:28.972 --> 04:36:30.006
CALIFORNIA AND MANY.

04:36:30.073 --> 04:36:31.107
ESPECIALLY SOME OF THESE CHAIN

04:36:31.174 --> 04:36:32.609
STORES ARE OPEN TWENTY FOUR

04:36:32.676 --> 04:36:35.045
HOURS A DAY.

04:36:35.111 --> 04:36:36.880
SO IF THERE IS A THE EMERGENT

04:36:36.947 --> 04:36:40.784
NEED. FOR PRESS OR PAP.

04:36:40.850 --> 04:36:43.887
A PATIENT CAN GET THOSE DRUGS --

04:36:43.954 --> 04:36:45.689
EASILY.

04:36:45.755 --> 04:36:47.624
AND IN A TIMELY WAY.

04:36:47.691 --> 04:36:51.127
LET'S FACE IT. ONE DOESN'T

04:36:51.194 --> 04:36:53.096
ALWAYS PLANNED ACTS OF PASSION.

04:36:53.163 --> 04:36:57.267
SOMETIMES THINGS JUST HAPPEN.

04:36:57.334 --> 04:36:59.269
BUT IF YOU NEED PROP OR PAT.

04:36:59.336 --> 04:37:00.904
AND YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH A

04:37:00.971 --> 04:37:02.138
DOCTOR TO GET IT TODAY.

04:37:02.205 --> 04:37:03.873
ANY NEED TO GO TO THE PRIOR

04:37:03.940 --> 04:37:04.908
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS CHANCES

04:37:04.975 --> 04:37:06.676
ARE.

04:37:06.743 --> 04:37:08.678
YOU MAY NOT GET TO THE INFECTION

04:37:08.745 --> 04:37:10.080
IN TIME WORD ACTION BECOMES.

04:37:10.146 --> 04:37:13.249
AN ACTIVE INFECTION.

04:37:13.316 --> 04:37:14.884
BEYOND SEVENTY TWO HOURS.

04:37:14.951 --> 04:37:16.619
THE LAYS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

04:37:16.686 --> 04:37:17.253
THESE DRUGS WERE THEY JUST DON'T

04:37:17.320 --> 04:37:20.290
WORK.

04:37:20.357 --> 04:37:20.824
LET'S LEAVE IT UP TO THE

04:37:20.890 --> 04:37:22.892
INDIVIDUALS THAT KNOW WHAT

04:37:22.959 --> 04:37:23.493
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND KNOW

04:37:23.560 --> 04:37:24.995
THAT THEY WILL.

04:37:25.061 --> 04:37:26.730
NEED TO GET MEDICATIONS TO

04:37:26.796 --> 04:37:27.564
PREVENT.

04:37:27.630 --> 04:37:29.399
THEIR HEALTH FROM DETERIORATING.

04:37:29.466 --> 04:37:31.568
WE HAVE PROOF THE PHARMACIST CAN

04:37:31.634 --> 04:37:33.036
TAKE ON MORE PROFESSIONAL ROLES

04:37:33.103 --> 04:37:34.004
LIKE DESCRIBING AND GIVING

04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:35.238
INNOVATIONS AND WE SHOULD BE

04:37:35.305 --> 04:37:36.840
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO EXPAND THE

04:37:36.906 --> 04:37:39.109
PROFESSIONAL ROLES. TO PREVENT

04:37:39.175 --> 04:37:41.111
MORE CASES OF AIDS.

04:37:41.177 --> 04:37:43.179
WE NEED TO ELIMINATE AIDS JUST

04:37:43.246 --> 04:37:44.381
LIKE WE ELIMINATED POLIO.

04:37:44.447 --> 04:37:46.016
WE HAVE THE DRUGS AVAILABLE AND

04:37:46.082 --> 04:37:47.717
THEY ARE SAFE AND THEY ARE

04:37:47.784 --> 04:37:49.853
EFFECTIVE.

04:37:49.919 --> 04:37:52.155
BUT SIMPLY PEOPLE JUST DON'T

04:37:52.222 --> 04:37:53.857
HAVE ACCESS.

04:37:53.923 --> 04:37:55.458
AS A SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO

04:37:55.525 --> 04:37:56.926
MENTIONED THE UPTAKE OF THESE

04:37:56.993 --> 04:37:59.129
DRUGS UNFORTUNATELY IS LOW MUCH

04:37:59.195 --> 04:38:00.430
LOWER THAN WE WOULD LIKE AND

04:38:00.497 --> 04:38:01.564
AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO

04:38:01.631 --> 04:38:03.199
ACCESSIBILITY AND TIMELY

04:38:03.266 --> 04:38:05.068
APPROVALS OF THESE DRUGS.

04:38:05.135 --> 04:38:06.336
WITH THE APPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS

04:38:06.403 --> 04:38:08.071
AN INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY

04:38:08.138 --> 04:38:10.140
ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF COLOR.

04:38:10.206 --> 04:38:12.208
WHERE WE SEE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE

04:38:12.275 --> 04:38:12.876
AND PERFECT BROUGHT UNDER ITS OF

04:38:12.942 --> 04:38:14.511
AIDS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT

04:38:14.577 --> 04:38:16.746
THESE INDIVIDUALS DON'T KNOW?

04:38:16.813 --> 04:38:18.782
THAT THESE PREVENTED OF DRUGS.

04:38:18.848 --> 04:38:20.016
ARE READILY AVAILABLE.

04:38:20.083 --> 04:38:21.117
WE COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE

04:38:21.184 --> 04:38:23.753
MORBIDITY AND LONG TERM SENTENCE

04:38:23.820 --> 04:38:26.122
OF PATIENTS THAT WILL COME DOWN

04:38:26.189 --> 04:38:27.991
WITH THE AIDS VIRUS.

04:38:28.058 --> 04:38:30.093
THIS BILL NOT ONLY COULD SAVE A

04:38:30.160 --> 04:38:31.327
LIFE BUT COULD ALSO GIVE HOPE TO

04:38:31.394 --> 04:38:33.263
THOSE WHO ARE RISK.

04:38:33.329 --> 04:38:35.198
OF GETTING HIV AND AIDS.

THAT WE NEED TO DO --

04:39:38.495 --> 04:39:39.729
UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT BEEN

04:39:39.796 --> 04:39:40.430
ABLE SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE

04:39:40.497 --> 04:39:41.297
I'VE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS

04:39:41.364 --> 04:39:42.365
ABOUT.

04:39:42.432 --> 04:39:44.667
HOW TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CLOSE

04:39:44.734 --> 04:39:47.504
THE LOOP AND BE SURE THAT IT IS

04:39:47.570 --> 04:39:49.706
PEOPLE ARE SEEKING CARE?

04:39:49.772 --> 04:39:52.175
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET -- THE

04:39:52.242 --> 04:39:54.077
HIGH QUALITY CONFERENCE OF CARE

04:39:54.144 --> 04:39:56.379
THEY NEED NOW I WILL SAY MY GOOD

04:39:56.446 --> 04:39:57.147
FRIEND TO TO MACULA THAT YES

04:39:57.213 --> 04:39:58.748
PHARMACISTS HAVE A VERY

04:39:58.815 --> 04:39:59.516
IMPORTANT ROLE.

04:39:59.582 --> 04:40:01.184
AND IN FACT PHARMACIST CAN DO A

04:40:01.251 --> 04:40:03.686
LOT IN FACT I HAVE NO OBJECTION

04:40:03.753 --> 04:40:05.955
TO THE IDEA THAT PHARMACISTS ARE

04:40:06.022 --> 04:40:07.357
GOING TO BE DISPENSING.

04:40:07.423 --> 04:40:09.425
OF BOTH PAP WHICH WE KNOW HAS A

04:40:09.492 --> 04:40:11.194
TIME LIMIT TIME FRAME IN WHICH

04:40:11.261 --> 04:40:12.262
SOMEONE HE'S RECEIVED THE

04:40:12.328 --> 04:40:13.930
MEDICATION SEVENTY TWO HOURS.

04:40:13.997 --> 04:40:15.665
OR PERHAPS WHICH IS ACTUALLY A

04:40:15.732 --> 04:40:17.467
MORE PREVENTIVE CARE --

04:40:17.534 --> 04:40:18.968
TREATMENT SO IT'S TO PREVENT

04:40:19.035 --> 04:40:20.870
GETTING INFECTED -- SO THERE'S A

04:40:20.937 --> 04:40:21.871
LITTLE LESS TIME AGENCY THERE

04:40:21.938 --> 04:40:23.940
BUT I'M FINE WITH PHARMACISTS

04:40:24.007 --> 04:40:25.808
ADMINISTERING THAT MEDICATION

04:40:25.875 --> 04:40:27.143
THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES IS

04:40:27.210 --> 04:40:29.245
THAT BECAUSE AND I APPRECIATE

04:40:29.312 --> 04:40:30.914
THE WORK OF THE THE ANTI

04:40:30.980 --> 04:40:32.982
COMMITTEE -- AS WELL AS WELL AS

04:40:33.049 --> 04:40:34.083
THE HEALTH ME THAT.

04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:36.152
UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF COURSE --

04:40:36.219 --> 04:40:37.587
THERE ARE SCREENING TESTS --

04:40:37.654 --> 04:40:39.556
NAMELY RENAL SCREENING TESTS

04:40:39.622 --> 04:40:41.457
THAT NEED TO BE CONDUCTED --

04:40:41.524 --> 04:40:42.992
BECAUSE OF ATTENTIONAL SIDE

04:40:43.059 --> 04:40:45.161
EFFECTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM

04:40:45.228 --> 04:40:46.930
THE MEDICATION AND IT'S A FAIRLY

04:40:46.996 --> 04:40:48.665
RARE BUT IT IT'S IT'S A

04:40:48.731 --> 04:40:49.265
POSSIBILITY THE OTHER THING I

04:40:49.332 --> 04:40:50.767
WOULD MAKE NOTE THOUGH IS IS

04:40:50.833 --> 04:40:52.669
THAT ALSO -- PATIENTS WHO ARE

04:40:52.735 --> 04:40:54.003
GETTING SCREEN WITH THIS TEST

04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:55.638
EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE A

04:40:55.705 --> 04:40:57.740
PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE MEDICATION

04:40:57.807 --> 04:40:59.676
THEY COULD HAVE A PRE EXISTING.

04:40:59.742 --> 04:41:00.877
CONDITION THAT MAYBE EARLY ON

04:41:00.944 --> 04:41:02.912
THAT AS ONLY IDENTIFIED BY THAT

04:41:02.979 --> 04:41:03.513
TEST.

04:41:03.580 --> 04:41:08.484
AND IN THIS BILL THE PHARMACIST

04:41:08.551 --> 04:41:09.519
WILL BE ADMINISTERING A

04:41:09.586 --> 04:41:10.887
MEDICATION WHICH IS FINE I'M

04:41:10.954 --> 04:41:13.122
FINE WITH THAT AND ALSO -- THEN

04:41:13.189 --> 04:41:14.724
ALSO DOING THE SCREENING TEST.

04:41:14.791 --> 04:41:15.925
AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHO'S

04:41:15.992 --> 04:41:17.427
REVIEWING THE SCREENING TEST

04:41:17.493 --> 04:41:18.895
RESULTS THIS IS NOT MERELY A

04:41:18.962 --> 04:41:20.530
MEDICATION LEVEL WHERE YOU GO

04:41:20.597 --> 04:41:22.165
OUT F THE MEDICATION IS NOW AT

04:41:22.232 --> 04:41:23.666
A SUFFICIENT DOSE OR NOT.

04:41:23.733 --> 04:41:25.168
IT'S NOT AN UP AND DOWN TEST

04:41:25.235 --> 04:41:27.770
THIS IS A SOMEWHAT MORE COMPLEX

04:41:27.837 --> 04:41:30.573
AND SO IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

04:41:30.640 --> 04:41:32.175
THEN THE ISSUE ECOMES WELL.

04:41:32.242 --> 04:41:33.910
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

04:41:33.977 --> 04:41:34.911
INTERPRETING TEST AND THEN

04:41:34.978 --> 04:41:36.446
COMMUNICATING WITH THE PATIENT

04:41:36.512 --> 04:41:38.414
HAS TO THE ROOT THOSE RESULTS --

04:41:38.481 --> 04:41:41.684
AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT IN THE

04:41:41.751 --> 04:41:43.886
BILL AND DUE TO MENACE ARE TAKEN

04:41:43.953 --> 04:41:45.922
THE BILL THAT FOR CRAP SO WE'RE

04:41:45.989 --> 04:41:46.589
GONNA.

04:41:46.656 --> 04:41:47.790
HAVE TO SIDE WHICH CAN TALK

04:41:47.857 --> 04:41:48.791
ABOUT WHICH IS THE PREVENTIVE

04:41:48.858 --> 04:41:51.361
PART THAT IN THAT TREATMENT THAT

04:41:51.427 --> 04:41:52.695
THEY CAN ONLY GET ESSENTIALLY

04:41:52.762 --> 04:41:54.697
ONE CYCLE ONE ONE ROUND OF

04:41:54.764 --> 04:41:56.799
TREATMENTS AND AND WHICH CASE

04:41:56.866 --> 04:41:59.269
THEY THEN NEED TO SEE -- WHAT

04:41:59.335 --> 04:41:59.802
THEY COULD GO TO ANOTHER

04:41:59.869 --> 04:42:02.538
PHARMACY -- BUT WHO WHO DOESN'T

04:42:02.605 --> 04:42:04.007
COMMUTE YOUNG COMMUNICATE FAR

04:42:04.073 --> 04:42:05.942
BUT IDEALLY THEY WOULD GO

04:42:06.009 --> 04:42:08.211
IDEALLY SEEK A A PHYSICIAN OR

04:42:08.278 --> 04:42:11.080
SOME OTHER -- PERSON -- OF HIS

04:42:11.147 --> 04:42:12.815
DECISION A POSITION TEAM AND I

04:42:12.882 --> 04:42:15.251
AND I THINK THAT -- BUT I MY

04:42:15.318 --> 04:42:16.986
CONCERN IS IS IS THAT BECAUSE

04:42:17.053 --> 04:42:17.954
ESPECIALLY FOR THE PEOPLE DON'T

04:42:18.021 --> 04:42:19.422
HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- FOR A

04:42:19.489 --> 04:42:20.456
PRIMARY CARE TEAM TO HAVE A

04:42:20.523 --> 04:42:21.758
PHYSICIAN NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE

04:42:21.824 --> 04:42:23.126
GONNA GET A FOLLOW UP RATE THAT

04:42:23.192 --> 04:42:24.594
THE LAB TESTS WILL GO TO THEM TO

04:42:24.661 --> 04:42:25.595
GET INTERPRETED.

04:42:25.662 --> 04:42:26.162
THIS BILL WILL TRY TO EXPAND

04:42:26.229 --> 04:42:28.398
ACCESS AND I WOULD POINT OUT

04:42:28.464 --> 04:42:29.599
THAT SO ONE OF THE THINGS I

04:42:29.666 --> 04:42:31.934
SUGGESTED -- WAS IS THAT.

04:42:32.001 --> 04:42:33.703
THE PHARMACIST SHOULD HAVE A

04:42:33.770 --> 04:42:35.138
CLEVER PRACTICE AGREEMENT WITH A

04:42:35.204 --> 04:42:36.906
POSITION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

04:42:36.973 --> 04:42:38.007
PHYSICIAN WHO ACTUALLY HAS

04:42:38.074 --> 04:42:38.975
REALLY SHE'S BUT THE PHARMACIST

04:42:39.042 --> 04:42:39.609
TO HELP.

04:42:39.676 --> 04:42:41.311
THE FED BY IS THEM TO REVIEW THE

04:42:41.377 --> 04:42:42.679
TASK TO DO ANYTHING THE

04:42:42.745 --> 04:42:44.147
PHARMACIST HAS.

04:42:44.213 --> 04:42:45.648
HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT IN FACT

04:42:45.715 --> 04:42:46.716
AGAIN WE'RE NOT TELLING THE

04:42:46.783 --> 04:42:47.717
PHARMACIST THAT THEY CAN'T JUST

04:42:47.784 --> 04:42:49.085
DISPENSE THE MEDICATION BUT THEY

04:42:49.152 --> 04:42:54.991
SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE TEY CAN GO

04:42:55.058 --> 04:42:56.025
REFER TO THERE'S A QUESTION --

04:42:56.092 --> 04:42:56.793
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

04:42:56.859 --> 04:42:57.593
SOME CONCERNS THAT THAT WOULD

04:42:57.660 --> 04:42:58.695
MAKE IT THAT PHARMACISTS MAYBE

04:42:58.761 --> 04:42:59.829
WON'T DO IT IF THEY HAVE TO GET

04:42:59.896 --> 04:43:00.930
A CLOUT FACT THIS AGREEMENT.

04:43:00.997 --> 04:43:02.865
AND THAT IT WAS ALSO SAID THAT

04:43:02.932 --> 04:43:04.233
WELL PHYSICIANS WOULDN'T AGREE

04:43:04.300 --> 04:43:05.568
TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE RISK

04:43:05.635 --> 04:43:07.236
WOULD BE TOO HIGH.

04:43:07.303 --> 04:43:08.471
ALTHOUGH I POINT OUT THAT OF THE

04:43:08.538 --> 04:43:09.972
RISK IS TOO HIGH FOR POSITION TO

04:43:10.039 --> 04:43:11.140
HAVE THIS AGREEMENT AND BY THE

04:43:11.207 --> 04:43:12.408
WAY THERE'D BE NO LIMITATION ON

04:43:12.475 --> 04:43:13.710
THE NUMBER PHARMACIST A

04:43:13.776 --> 04:43:14.277
PHYSICIAN COULD HAVE THIS

04:43:14.344 --> 04:43:16.713
AGREEMENT WITH -- THEN I WOULD

04:43:16.779 --> 04:43:17.914
SAY THAT THE PHARMACIST

04:43:17.980 --> 04:43:19.716
THEMSELVES IF THE PHYSICIANS

04:43:19.782 --> 04:43:20.983
CANNOT GET THINK THE RISK IS TOO

04:43:21.050 --> 04:43:22.819
HIGH I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANS

04:43:22.885 --> 04:43:23.486
FOR PHARMACISTS WHO DOESN'T HAVE

04:43:23.553 --> 04:43:24.320
ANYONE.

04:43:24.387 --> 04:43:25.888
THIS BACKING THEM UP.

04:43:25.955 --> 04:43:27.924
SO I'M NOT ACTUALLY A STAND HERE

04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:29.892
AND URGE ANYONE NOT TO VOTE FOR

04:43:29.959 --> 04:43:32.261
THE BILL AND FORTY I CANNOT.

04:43:32.328 --> 04:43:33.596
BUT I KNOW AND I I CERTAINLY

04:43:33.663 --> 04:43:34.964
HAVE A LOT OF FAITH MY FRIEND

04:43:35.031 --> 04:43:36.265
FROM SAN FRANCISCO I HOPE WE CAN

04:43:36.332 --> 04:43:37.333
TRY TO WORK.

04:43:37.400 --> 04:43:39.836
THIS ISSUE OUT BEFORE THE BILL

04:43:39.902 --> 04:43:41.571
BILL ENDS UP ON THE GOVERNOR'S

04:43:41.637 --> 04:43:42.672
DESK ARE SIGNED INTO LAW BECAUSE

04:43:42.739 --> 04:43:44.340
I DO THINK THIS IS A CRITICAL

04:43:44.407 --> 04:43:45.375
PART WE TALK ABOUT TEAM BASED

04:43:45.441 --> 04:43:45.875
CARE.

04:43:45.942 --> 04:43:46.943
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT HOW DO WE

04:43:47.009 --> 04:43:48.511
BUILD THE TEAM TO BE SURE THAT

04:43:48.578 --> 04:43:49.679
PEOPLE CAN GET.

04:43:49.746 --> 04:43:52.148
HIGH QUALITY CARE SO WITH THAT I

04:43:52.215 --> 04:43:53.116

LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

04:43:56.018 --> 04:43:57.387
AUTHOR BECAUSE I KNOW WE SHARE

04:43:57.453 --> 04:43:58.588
THE SAME GOALS I KNOW HE SHARES

04:43:58.654 --> 04:44:00.523
THAT GOAL -- AND THAT HOPEFULLY

04:44:00.590 --> 04:44:02.392
WE CAN LAND THIS BILL IN A PLACE

04:44:02.458 --> 04:44:04.861
THAT -- WILL BE SURE AND I KNOW

04:44:04.927 --> 04:44:06.329
THAT'S HIS DESIRE TO THAT OF

04:44:06.396 --> 04:44:07.497
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET HIGH

04:44:07.563 --> 04:44:10.933
QUALITY CARE AND THAT WE'RE

04:44:11.000 --> 04:44:11.567
GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE THANK

04:44:15.304 --> 04:44:15.538
[inaudible]

04:44:15.605 --> 04:44:17.440
SENATOR GLAZER.

I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT

04:44:18.975 --> 04:44:19.876
MEMBERS.

04:44:19.942 --> 04:44:21.978
AT THIS THOUGHTFUL DEBATE ON THE

04:44:22.044 --> 04:44:24.647
FLOOR TODAY -- WAS REFLECTIVE OF

04:44:24.714 --> 04:44:25.848
THE THE DEEP.

04:44:25.915 --> 04:44:27.617
CONSIDERATION AT THIS MEASURE

04:44:27.683 --> 04:44:28.885
HAD AND CERTAINLY IN FRONT OF

04:44:28.951 --> 04:44:30.553

04:44:30.620 --> 04:44:31.154
COMMITTED I'M SURE THE HEALTH

04:44:31.220 --> 04:44:31.788
COMMITTEE.

04:44:31.854 --> 04:44:33.423
I IN THAT ACT BROAD

04:44:33.489 --> 04:44:34.891
CONSULTATIONS WERE UNDERTAKING

04:44:34.957 --> 04:44:36.559
WITH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY --

04:44:36.626 --> 04:44:39.362
AND WITH OTHERS ABOUT -- THIS

04:44:39.429 --> 04:44:40.596
ISSUE THAT THE SENATOR FROM

04:44:40.663 --> 04:44:43.433
SINCE SAN FRANCISCO SO PROPERLY

04:44:43.499 --> 04:44:44.834
BROUGHT FORWARD TO US.

04:44:44.901 --> 04:44:46.903
AND AND TWO CONCLUSIONS THAT I

04:44:46.969 --> 04:44:49.772
SHARE WITH YOU. ONE IS THAT.

04:44:49.839 --> 04:44:52.074
IN A PERFECT WORLD -- THIS TYPE

04:44:52.141 --> 04:44:55.011
OF HEALTH CARE WOULD BE DIRECTED

04:44:55.077 --> 04:44:56.279
BY A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN.

04:44:56.345 --> 04:44:57.713
THAT -- FOLKS WOULD HAVE.

04:44:57.780 --> 04:44:59.916
THAT INITIATE THAT CONTACT

04:44:59.982 --> 04:45:01.083
BEFORE PROBLEM OCCURS.

04:45:01.150 --> 04:45:02.985
I CERTAINLY BE ABLE.

04:45:03.052 --> 04:45:04.287
TO REACH THAT PRIMARY CARE

04:45:04.353 --> 04:45:05.922
PHYSICIAN WITHIN SEVENTY TWO

04:45:05.988 --> 04:45:08.191
HOURS AFTER -- THAT THEIR BELIEF

04:45:08.257 --> 04:45:09.792
THAT A PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED --

04:45:09.859 --> 04:45:12.295
BUT THE PRACTICAL NATURE OF THIS

04:45:12.361 --> 04:45:15.331
IS THAT -- THE PERFECT CAN'T BE

04:45:15.398 --> 04:45:18.201
THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD -- THAT

04:45:18.267 --> 04:45:19.602
WAS CAN'T CONCLUSION NUMBER.

04:45:19.669 --> 04:45:21.838
ONE ISSUE NUMBER TWO WAS THAT --

04:45:21.904 --> 04:45:23.239
WE CAREFULLY EXAMINED.

04:45:23.306 --> 04:45:24.774
THE GUIDELINES FROM THE CENTER

04:45:24.841 --> 04:45:26.142
FOR DISEASE CONTROL IN REGARD TO

04:45:26.209 --> 04:45:29.245
THESE -- DOSAGES THAT WOULD BE

04:45:29.312 --> 04:45:30.847
REQUIRED FOR PREP AND FOR PAT.

04:45:30.913 --> 04:45:32.515
AND THE CONCLUSION THAT -- I

04:45:32.582 --> 04:45:34.484
CERTAINLY CAME TO I THINK OUR

04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:36.886
OUR COMMITTEE CAME -- TO IS THAT.

04:45:36.953 --> 04:45:39.989
THE HEALTH CARE CONSEQUENCES OF
