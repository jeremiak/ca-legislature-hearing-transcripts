SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN OUR OUR OUR HEARING TODAY WITH OUR FIRST BILL ON SENATOR LABOR WHICH LIKE TO COME FORWARD GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL. S. B. THREE TWENTY WOULD REQUIRE ALL ON CAMPUS HELL STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. TO PROVIDE MEDICATION FOR EARLY PREGNANCY TERMINATION FOR THEIR STUDENTS BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY. ACCORDING TO THE GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE SINCE TWO THOUSAND OVER ONE POINTFIVE MILLION WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE TERMINATED EARLY REGNANCIES THROUGH THE USE OF MEDICATED ABORTION. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WOMEN AGE TWENTY THROUGH TWENTY FOUR ACCOUNTED FOR THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF ABORTIONS THE LARGEST FOR ANY AGE GROUP. MEDICATION ABORTION AS A TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE PATIENT TAKES TWO SETS OF PILLS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS DURING THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. ACCORDING TO A UC SAN FRANCISCO STUDY ABORTION MEDICATION HAS SERIOUS ADRIFT ADVERSE EFFECTS AND ONLY ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT OF CASES. WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS SAFER THAN TYLENOL AND*. THAT SAME STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT EVERY MONTH UP TO FIVE HUNDRED IN NINETEEN STUDENTS AT THE THIRTY FOUR UC AND CSU CAMPUSES SEEK MEDICATION ABORTIONS ON OFFSITE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. MANY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC AT UNIVERSITIES ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SUCH AS PREGNANCY OPTIONS COUNSELLING AND CONTRACEPTIVES ALL CONSIDER THESE SERVICES TO BE A COMPONENT OF BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES. MEDICATION ABORTION IS A SAFE PROCEDURE AND IS CLINICALLY SIMPLER THAN MUCH OF THE CARE ALREADY OFFERED A COLLEGE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS SUCH AS DIABETES MANAGEMENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AND DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE NUMEROUS BARRIERS WHEN SEEKING TO TERMINATE A PREGNANCY NCLUDING FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS LIMITED ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION AND CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES TO THE CLOSEST ABORTION PROVIDER. BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. IT'S CRITICAL SINCE MONTH MOST WOMEN RECEIVE THIS CARE THEY MIGHT MOST WOMEN MUST RECEIVE THIS CARE WITHIN TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. AND MOST WOMEN DON'T YOU FIND OUT THEY'RE PREGNANT INTO THEIR FIVE TO SIX WEEKS INTO THEIR PREGNANCY. DENYING COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCESSIBLE REPRODUCTIVE CARE ON CAMPUS INTERFERES WITH THE WELL BEING AN ACADEMIC SUCCESS OF WOMEN AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS DOCTOR DAN GROSSMAN PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. AT UC SAN FRANCISCO BRISCOE AND JESSICA. JESSE A STUDENT AT UC RIVERSIDE JUST IS GOING TO START. MY NAME IS JUST YOUR SALAS SIME A FOURTH YEAR STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. ASIDE FROM BEING A STUDENT I ALSO SERVED AS THE PRESIDENT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD GENERATION ACTION FOR TWO YEARS ON MY CAMPUS. AND I HOPE TO CONTINUE ADVOCATING FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND TODAY I'M HERE TO STAND UP FOR THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED IN UNINTENDED PREGNANCY. I WAS JUST BEGINNING MY THIRD YEAR WHEN I HAD MY ABORTION. AROUND OCTOBER I STARTED TO FEEL SICK DECIDED TO GO TO MY STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. I DIDN'T THINK I COULD BE PREGNANT I WAS ON BIRTH CONTROL. BUT THERE I WAS THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT I WAS PREGNANT. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I COULD DO I'D NEW THAT I CAN PROVIDE THE BEST LIFE FOR MYSELF OR FOR A CHILD STILL HAD TWO YEARS UNTIL I HAD TO GRADUALLY AND I WAS. UP FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE. I NEEDED AN ABORTION. THE DOCTOR SET UP AN APPOINTMENT WITH A DIFFERENT DOCTOR FROM YOU SEE OUR. LATE DAYS LATER I'M THAT WITHOUT DOCTOR WHO REFERRED ME TO THREE DIFFERENT FACILITIES. THE FIRST DISABILITY DID NOT EVEN OFFER ABORTIONS. THE SECOND ONE DIDN'T. WITH ABLE TO SCHEDULE ME BUT NOT UNTIL NOVEMBER. IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH. TWO WEEKS BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT THE SECOND FACILITY DENIED MY INSURANCE CLEANING THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE UC STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN. FEELING EXTREMELY DISCOURAGED TO THE ENTIRE ORDEAL SENT ME ON A DOWNWARD SPIRAL. I DO GO OUT AND MY GRADES SLIPPED DRAMATICALLY. AND EVERYDAY WAS EXHAUSTING. MOST OF MY DAYS ARE SPENT NAPPING BECAUSE I WAS EXHAUSTED AND BECAUSE I WANTED TO ESCAPE THE REALITY OF MY SITUATION. NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I THEN AGAIN CALLED MY STUDENT HEALTH CENTER AND ASKED ABOUT MY OTHER OPTIONS. IT WAS THEN THAT THEY CLARIFIED THAT I WAS NOT LIMITED TO MY REFERRALS. SO FINALLY I WAS ABLE TO SCHEDULE MY APPOINTMENT WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHICH AGAIN IS OFF CAMPUS AND I DID NOT HAVE A CAR. AND GOT MY PROCEDURE DONE EARLY DECEMBER. MY SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER WAS THERE. AND PROVIDE IN MEDICATION ABORTIONS FOR STUDENTS ON CAMPUS S. B. THREE TWENTY WOULD ENSURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF COULD HAVE THE CARE THAT I NEEDED WHEN I NEEDED IT. MIGRATES AND HEALTH WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFERED BECAUSE OF IT STUDENT HEALTH CENTER SHOULD HAVE HOLISTIC REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND I HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU WILL SUPPORT. US SB THREE TWENTY SO STUDENTS LIKE ME WILL HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THEIR OPTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE WE MOVE ON A MINUTE QUICKEN AND WE HAVE A QUORUM SO GAS SECOND CALL ROLE THANK YOU. WHAT HERE MAYES? AGUIAR-CURRY. BIGELOW. BONTA. BURKE CARILLO. FLORA. LOW MOAN. MCCARTY NAZARIAN RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO THURMOND WALDRON. SO WE DO HAVE QUORUM SO THANK YOU PLEASE PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR SECOND WITNESS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I'M IN THANK YOU JESSIE FOR SHARING YOUR YOUR STORY AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS DOCTOR DANIEL GROSSMAN I'M A PROFESSOR. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT DIRECTOR RESEARCH PROGRAM CALLED ADVANCING YOU STANDARDS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OR ANSWER. MY CLINICAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING PROVIDING ABORTION CARE ARE BASED AT SOCCER BRICKS IN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL. Y. ALSO TRAIN MEDICAL STUDENTS RESIDENTS FELLOWS IN ADVANCE PRACTICE CLINICIANS. I AT THE REQUEST OF THE FIRST LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE TAT HEARD SB THREE TWENTY SENATE HEALTH. RESEARCHERS AT ANSWER PERFORM TWO STUDIES RELATED TO THE BILL I BELIEVE YOU HAVE COPIES OF OUR REPORTS AND BOTH OF WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN PUBLISHED IN PEER REVIEW JOURNALS. BEFORE DISCUSS THOSE FINDINGS I JUST WANNA SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT MEDICATION PORTION ON SENATOR LEYVA ALREADY DESCRIBED HOW THIS AND THE MEDICATIONS ARE PRESCRIBED. THEY'RE VERY SAFE AND VERY EFFECTIVE. AN OVERALL ABOUT THREE PERCENT OF WOMEN NEED A VACUUM ASPIRATION OR SURGICAL ABORTION I'M A VERY VERY SMALL MINORITY. MEDICATION ABORTION CAN BE SAFELY OFFERED BY WHO BEAT YOU ENDS BY FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS BY ADVANCED PRACTICE CLINICIANS INCLUDING YOURS PRACTITIONERS. PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANTS AND CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES REALLY ANY POSITION OR CLINICIAN WHO'S BEEN TRAINED TO PROVIDE THE METHOD. THE NATIONALS QUE ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE ISSUED A REPORT EARLIER THIS YEAR ABOUT THE SAFETY OF ABORTION GENERALLY AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT MEDICATION ABORTION AND SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHTED. HOW ADVANCED PRACTICE CLINICIANS CONCEIVABLY PROVIDE SERVICE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT MEDICATION ABORTION AND HOW IT'S PROVIDED A FEW QUESTIONS? I'M THE FIRST IT HAD LIKE TO DISCUSS WAS LED BY MY COLLEAGUE DOCTOR WHO SMOKED POT BE AYE FROM ANSWER AND AIM TO QUANTIFY ACCESS TO ABORTION FOR YOU SEE AND CSU STUDENTS. AND AND ASSESS HOW FAR A. THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL TO ACCESS ABORTION CARE. BRIEFLY THE RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE THAT BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO AND FIVE HUNDRED NINETEEN UC AND CSU STUDENTS OBTAIN A MEDICATION ABORTION EACH MONTH. WHICH WORKS OUT TO BE ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN MEDICATION ABORTIONS PER CAMPUS PER MONTH AT THIS NUMBER OF CASES IS SIMILAR TO WHAT OTHER FAMILY MEDICINE PROVIDERS REPORT IN THEIR CLINICS AND IT'S CERTAINLY A SUFFICIENT NUMBER FOR CLINICIANS TO MAINTAIN THEIR SKILLS. IN TERMS OF THE DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST PROVIDER THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT ACROSS ALL CAMPUSES THE MEDIAN TIME IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT. THAT. PROVIDER THAT I'D STUDENT WOULD NEED AND TAKE TO GET TOWARD A CLINIC IS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR MINUTES EACH WAY GIVEN THE TWO VISITS THAT WORKS OUT TO BE TWO HOURS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT. THE SECOND STUDY. WE AIM TO COLLECT INFORMATION FROM ALL THE UC AND CSU CAMPUSES AND TO SEE IF THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE MEDICATION PORTION ON CAMPUS. AND WHAT THEY WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH THAT THAT'S ALL COVERED IN MY REPORT BUT JUST TO SAY. THAT WE DID FIND. THAT. THAT THIS THE SITES HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED AND WITH A MODERATE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT SIMILAR TO THE INVESTMENT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN. AND PROMISED TO BUY AND THE FUNDING CONSORTIUM THAT AT THE THESE SITES WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER MEDICATION ABORTION THEY WOULD NEED I'M INVEST IN TERMS OF TRAINING. IN TERMS OF ULTRASOUND ARRANGING TWENTY FOUR HOUR CALL SERVICE ON AND BACK UP FROM LOCAL A POSITIONS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS BUT ALL THIS IS VERY FEASIBLE. ON AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS FUNDING LEVEL FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PROMISED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO PREPARE THE STUDENT HEALTH CARE CENTERS TO PROVIDE MEDICATION ABORTION IF THE BILL WERE TO PASS. THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SO PLEASE AS BEFORE THIS IS FOR SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION.

MY NAME IS REBECCA BUELL HAGEN AND I AM HERE REPRESENTING THE MANY CALIFORNIA COLLEGESTUDENTS WHO FOUND THEMSELVES AN UNPLANNED AND SEEMINGLY HOPELESS PREGNANCIES. IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I DISCOVERED I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY SECOND CHILD. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE DAY I SAW AT THE GROCERY STORE BATHROOM. COMPLETELY ALONE STARING AT THAT SECOND POSITIVE PREGNANCY TO. I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD. A FRESHMAN AT SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY AND A MOTHER TO ELEVEN MONTH OLD CHILD. I HAD JUST LEFT. PHYSICALLY AND VERBALLY ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP I HAD BEEN ALL OF MY TEENAGE YEARS. AND I THOUGHT THAT RAISING TWO CHILDREN AND EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WHILE IN SCHOOL WOULD BE COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE. SO I SOUGHT A SOLUTION I SOUGHT OUT A LOCATION. I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT THERE WERE EIGHT ABORTION FACILITIES BETWEEN ME AND MY HOME I'M AND RUBS THEM WITHIN A TWENTY FIVE MILE RADIUS CLEARLY ACCESSIBILITY WAS NOT AN ISSUE. HOW WITH REALLY NO HOPE IN SIGHT AND FEELING ALONE SCARED DESPERATE AND HOPELESS AB YET MEDICATION ABORTION ON MARCH THIRTEENTH OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN? IT IS A DAY THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET. I WALKED INTO MY FINAL APPOINTMENT AT A CLINIC IN NORTH HIGHLANDS AND I AT THIS POINT I WAS JUST OVER SEVEN WEEKS PREGNANT. WHEN HE SAT DOWN WITH THE WOMAN WHO HAD ARE YOU FORTY SIX ABORTION PALMOS SMALL DIXIE CUP. SHE WENT OVER WITH ME AGAIN HOW THE SERBIAN FLEXIBLE BC IF MORE NATURAL. AND WE THOUGHT I SWALLOWED THE PILL IN FRONT OF HER. IT WAS SENT ON MY WAY BUT IT WAS NOT PREPARED FOR WHAT WAS TO COME NEXT. BY THE TIME I GOT TO MY CAR WITH MY BROWN PAPER BAG FULL OF MEDICATION. I BROKE OUT. I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED AND I BEGAN TO FEEL INTENSE SADNESS AND REGRET. CRISIS IN FEAR HAD FOUGHT MY MIND FOR THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THIS DECISION BUT I COULD NOW SEE CLEARLY THE EXTENT OF MY ACTIONS. AND I WANTED SO BADLY TO TAKE BACK THE LAST TEN MINUTES OF MY LIFE. I WAS A MOTHER IN MOURNING WANTING SO DESPERATELY TO WISH ALL AWAY. INSTEAD OF TAKING ME SO PROCESS ALL. THE FOLLOWING DAY A DRUG THAT IS COMMONLY GIVEN TWIN IN IT ACTIVELY PER TO INDUCE INTENSE CONTRACTIONS AND TO EXPEL A FETUS. I CHANGE MY MIND AND UNDERWENT. SOME OF THIS BECAUSE SOME OF YOU MAY CONSIDER THIS CONTROVERSIAL BUT THE ABORTION WHO OVERSAW REGIMENT. THE PROCESS THAT AIMS TO GET PROGESTERONE BACK INTO A WOMAN'S BODY TO COUNTERACT THE ARE YOU FORTY SIX ABORTION PILL I TOOK. I CARRY DETERRENT MAY NOW ALMOST FIVE YEAR OLD SON WAS AND STILL IS PERFECTLY HEALTHY. LAST YEAR I DID GRADUATE COLLEGE WITH BOTH OF MY CHILDREN IN ATTENDANCE. THE I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE WE ARE STORY ENDED I OFTEN REFLECT ON THE EMOTIONS I FELT THE DAY BEGAN MY ABORTION. GRIEF FEAR HOPELESSNESS GUILT AN INTENSE SADNESS OR JUST A FEW THAT I CAN NAME. LAST MONTH I VISITED THAT VERY CLEAN TO RETRIEVE MY MEDICAL RECORDS AND IT WRECKED ME ALL OVER AGAIN FIVE YEARS LATER. S. B. EACH WEEK THREE TWENTY LEAVES ME DEEPLY CONCERNED FOR STUDENTS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL ENABLE CAMPUSES AND STUDENTS. I'M CERTAIN HEALTH CENTERS TO BECOME PLEASES OF TRAUMATIC JUST LIKE THAT CLINICS STILL IS FOR ME. INSTEAD IT IS MY HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA. COLLEGES WILL OFFER MORE SUPPORT RESOURCES ENCOURAGEMENT AND A PATH THAT DOES NOT LEAVE WOMEN LIKE ME TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR CHILD'S AND EDUCATION THANK YOU. BUT HEALTH COMMITTEE. THE MISSION OF HEALTH CARE IS TO SAVE LIVES HOWEVER AT THIS BILL. DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE SPT TWENTY IS INTENDED TO KILL. HUMAN LIFE JUST LIKE BECKY SON UP TO TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. OUR BEHALF OF STUDENTS LIKE BECKY AND THEIR CHILDREN IN BILLIONS OF WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN HURT BY ABORTION WE MUST DO MORE TO HELP OUR PREGNANT STUDENTS ON CAMPUS. ON BEHALF OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHOM YOU REPRESENT HERE AS PART OF THIS COMMITTEE. INCLUDING THOSE WHO WORK IN STERN HEALTH CENTERS. YOU'RE CREATING A BURDENSOME MANDATE UPON THEM IF THEY HAD WANTED TO WORK IN AN ABORTION CLINIC I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE CHOSEN OTHER. I'M LINE OF BUSINESS IN WHICH TO SERB THEIR STUDENTS. THE AUTHOR HAS SAID THAT THIS ABORTION PILL IS NATURAL AND SAFE. HOWEVER THE ABORTION PILL IS. LOU A LETHAL DRUG THE ABORTION PILL WAS IN THE NEWS RECENTLY BECAUSE A BOYFRIEND GROUND UP THE ABORTION PILL. AND PUT IT IN THE DRINK THE TEA OF HIS PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND WAS PREGNANT WITH THEIR BABY AT SEVENTEEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. THE BOYFRIEND WAS SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON FOR FETAL. HOMICIDE FOR DELIBERATELY KILLING HIS GIRL PRINCE BABY WITH THESE CHEMICAL ABORTION PILLS AND YET. HERE WE HAVE THIS BILL THAT IS INTENDED TO. PROMOTE EVEN GREATER ACCESS NOTICED THAT THE FIRST PILL IS PROVIDED WITHIN THE CLINIC SETTING THE SECOND SET OF PILLS WHICH CAUSES THE MISCARRIAGE. IS TAKEN LATER WHO KNOWS WHO WILL END UP WITH THESE. PILLS ONCE THEY'RE DISTRIBUTED ON CAMPUS IN THE UNIVERSITY WILL BE HELD BE HELD LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE DEATHS. I HEARD EARLIER THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE. GIVEN TO THIS EFFORT THINK OF THE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STUDENTS LIKE. BECKY AND JUSTIN WHO SPOKE EARLY EARLIER THINK OF THE SCHOLARSHIPS THAT COULD BE GIVEN TO OUR STUDENTS IT'S ON CAMPUSES THEY. CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. THE ITEM OF A BACK SO SUSPEND. DISCUSSED AND YET WE'VE DONE OUR RESEARCH WITHIN. SIX MILES OF ANY. ON AVERAGE OF ANY YOU SEE CSU CAMPUS THERE IS ALREADY AN EXISTING CHEMICAL ABORTION PROVIDER ACCORDING TO KIM APPIAN SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UC BERKELEY UNIVERSITY HEALTH CENTERS. THERE ARE FOUR FACILITIES WITHIN FOUR MILES OF UC BERKELEY THAT ALREADY PROVIDE ABORTION PILLS I CALLED THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLOSEST UC BERKELEY JUST YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. AND THEY HAD A CHEMICAL ABORTION APPOINTMENT WAITING FOR ME THIS MORNING AND SEVERAL THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. ABORTION NUMBERS ARE DROPPING EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH SUCH A DECLINE FOR THIS SO CALLED SERVICE WHY WHY WOULD WE MAKE COMMANDED UPON OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. IF THERE'S ANY CREDIBILITY AT ALL TO THIS ASSERTION OF QUOTE UNQUOTE LACK OF ACCESS. WHY PLACE THE MANDATE UPON UNIVERSITY WHY NOT GO TO THE ABORTION INDUSTRY DIRECTLY? THEY HAVE. THEY'RE SITTING ON TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE AND ACCEPTS EXCESSIVE EXPENDITURES. FORCED THEM PUT THE MANDATE ON THEM TO STAY OPEN LATE ON. INTO THE EVENING ARE OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE INTENDED TO BE A PLACE OF HIGHER EDUCATION NOT AN ABORTION CLINIC AND FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS.

MY NAME IS KEVIN CANTY FROM ROSEVILLE AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. MY NAME IS SEAN COONEY OPPOSED TO SPELL. ANYONE ELSE. SEE AS IT SEEMED NO ONE TOLD BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE COMMENTS WE ARE. AS WELL. THANK YOU I. OF COURSE IT WAS A LOT OF. TESTIMONY IN THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. AND I. I WANT TO LOOK UP YOU KNOW WHAT IS THIS ARE YOU FOUR EIGHTY SIX SO WHAT THE* DO. AND THE IT'S WHEN I GOOGLE IT YOU KNOW YOU JUST GO ONLINE AND LOOK GOOD FOR DIFFERENT SO TRY TO FIND A A FAIRLY. ACCURATE. WEBSITE AND IT SAYS THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL. THE BLOCK THE ACTION OF THE HORMONE PROGESTERONE. SO FOR JUST FROM IS NEEDED TO CONTINUE PREGNANCY. NORMAL IMPLANTATION. A OF THE PLACENTAL. TO VOTE LINING OF THE UTERUS. BUT WHAT FLOOR ARE YOU FOUR EIGHTY SIX THOSE. CAUSES LOW LYING TO DIE AND SEPARATE FROM THE UNIT AND BALL. AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE BLOOD SUPPLY THE GHOSTS OF THE BABY. THE CARRIES THE NUTRIENTS IN THE OXYGEN IS CUT OFF SO. EVENTUALLY THE. PLACENTA FALLS AWAY IN THE BABY HUNT. AND THEN THEIR. OWN. THAT'S WHAT KILLS THE BABY SO. I THOUGHT OKAY SO I UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WORKS IN IN ON THIS ARE LOT OF ISSUES WITH IT. COME BOTH MEDICALLY. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY JUST IN ONLY TAKING ADVIL BECAUSE THERE IS. SIDE EFFECTS. WHEN I LOOKED YOU KNOW IT'S IS BASICALLY EVERYONE'S GONNA HAVE CRAMPING TO SOME EXTENT THOSE BLEEDING. PAIN NAUSEA DIARRHEA STOMACH PAIN ALL THESE THINGS BUT YOU KNOW IS A MOM AND I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR HOME. THEY MAY HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION EVEN THEY MAY HAVE AN EVEN ONLY SINGS ARE SLIM. YOU KNOW AND IN SOME CASES RARE. THERE IS AN INFECTION THAT COULD CALM AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO. NO MY WORRY IS. YOU KNOW LOOKING AT YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN WHAT THEY KNOW. YOU KNOW AT WHAT LEVEL THEIR EXPERIENCE AND SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO GO BACK WHAT TO SEE ITS POSITION. SO THERE THERE'S CONCERNS MEDICALLY IN THAT REGARD HOME BUT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. FOR. EITHER SIDE WHO WERE WITNESSES OR ANYONE WHO CAN ANSWER. JUST BECAUSE I READ THE BILL SO WASN'T SURE. IT DIDN'T EXPLICITLY SAY IN THE BILL SOME OF THIS. PART OF IT IS EMPLOYEES WHO ARE WORKING IN IN THESE HEALTH CLINICS IN THOSE THINGS SCHOOLS. WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM IF THEY REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE OF THEIR CONSCIENCE AS THERE A EXCLUSION? FOR CONSCIENCE OBJECTION. DID THE FOLKS WHO WORK IN THE HEALTH CARE CENTER DON'T HAVE TO WORK IF THEY DON'T WANT TO. WELL THEN THAT THE ANSWER IS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMINISTER IT THEY WOULD NOT BE HIRED TO ADMINISTER A BECAUSE HOUSE BE ADMINISTERED BY AN RN. OKAY. AND I KNOW THEY HAVE TO HAVE TRAINING IN THERE'S NO THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF FOLKS THAT CAN GET THAT TRAINING. SO OKAY. AND THE OTHER THING WAS. REGARDING LIABILITY. I THINK IT WAS BROUGHT UP. IN THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. WHAT IF SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS HAPPEN IN THERE IS AN INJURY? IS THE SCHOOL LIABLE OR DOES THE BILL CONTAINS. AN EXEMPTION NORA. BUT THE SCHOOL IS NO MORE LIABLE FOR THIS PROCEDURE THAN THEY ARE FOR ANY OTHER PROCEDUREAT THAT A STUDENT MIGHT OBTAIN AT THE HEALTH CENTER. SO WOULD THAT DOES AND I WOULD ASSUME THEN THE SAME THING WILL GO FOR THE HEALTH CENTERS THAT THEY HAVE. A. TRANSFER AGREEMENT WITH A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR ANY OF THAT THESE COMPLICATIONS ARE ANY OTHER. I JUST I MASSIVE ASCENDANCY IN THE BILL EXPERT. DR GROSSMAN. AND JUST TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO MEDICAL REASON WHY THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A TRANSFER AGREEMENT LIKE A WRITTEN TRANSFER AGREEMENT IN FACT. THE RECENT REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE SAID SUCH WRITTEN AGREEMENTS ARE NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE TO SEND. PATIENTS WHO HAVE A RARE COMPLICATION SO THEY CAN GET TREATMENT BUT THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THROUGH A WRITTEN AGREEMENT. OKAY BUT THE SINCE IT'S A HEALTH CENTER. I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY DO HAVE SOME. AGREEMENTS WITH THE LOCAL HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM FOR ANYTHING BROKEN LEG OR ANYTHING ELSE WHEN WE WOULD HOPE SO TOO. OKAY LET'S JUST ONE OF THIS IS QUESTIONS BECAUSE I I. READ THE BILL. LAST BUT NOT LEAST COM. THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THAT GENERALFUND MONIES OR STUDENT FEES. FOR MEDICATION FOR SOMEBODY IN THIS OP THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE USED BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO COULD SOME STUDENT FEES GO TOWARDS THAT? THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ALL HEALTH CENTERS WILL HAVE RECEIVED TRAINING SO THEY CAN BILL FOR THE PROCEDURE THEY WILL NOT ONLY BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THAT PROCEDURE. IT WILL ALSO FUND THE HEALTH CARE CENTER SLID EVEN MORE ALLY MORE SERVICES CAN BE OFFERED TO STUDENTS SO THERE SHOULD NEVER BE AND NEED TO USE GENERAL FUND MONIES. WHAT ABOUT THE STUDENT FEES THE OR STUDENT FEES? NONE OF THAT SHOULD EVER BE NEEDED. AND NOT YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A VERY. LIKE I SAID SERIOUS ISSUE. AND I KNOW THAT NOT ONLY IS THE PHYSICAL SIDE EFFECTS BUT THOSE ALSO. YOU KNOW PSYCHOLOGICAL. THEM DEPRESSION AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND. I THINK YOU KNOW HAVING THESE YOUNG STUDENTS SOME OF THEM AS I SAID AWAY FROM HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT'S. AN ISSUE THAT. IS GOES BEYOND JUST THE PHYSICAL THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ON YOU KNOW I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. BUT I JUST WANT TO GET THOSE THINGS OUT ON THE. IN THE RECORD THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER. CARILLO. I THINK IT'S. NOT WORKING FROM. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL VERY IMPORTANT BILL TO OUR ATTENTION I WOULD BE MORE THAN HONORED TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL. TO THE YOUNG WOMEN WHO HAVE TESTIFIED TODAY. KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US THAT UNDERSTAND. THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF A DECISION THAT YOU MAKE. AND HOW THAT IMPACTS YOUR BODY AND YOUR CHOICE. WE ARE IN A TIME IN WHICH THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS POTENTIALLY THE FUNDING SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD. WHICH IS USUALLY A PLACE WHERE YOU MIGHT GO FOR THE SERVICES AND SO AS A STATE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IN ENSURING THAT. THEIR ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS A PRIORITY. TOO YOU KNOW I AM A WOMAN OF FAITH. AND FOR PERMISSION TO READ MISTER CHAIR IF THAT'S OKAY. I WANNA I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING THAT. POPE FRANCIS HAS SHARED THAT IS VERY RELEVANT TO THE TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE IN TODAY AND TO THE FOLKS. OUT THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN FAITH I WOULD SAY. POPE FRANCIS S. SAYS HAS SET. OUR DEFENSE OF THE INNOCENT UNBORN FOR EXAMPLE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR FUHRMAN PASSIONATE. EQUALLY SACRED HOWEVER. ARE THE LIVES OF THE POOR THOSE ALREADY BORN THE DESTITUTE THE ABANDONED AND THE OTHER PRIVILEGE. AND I REALLY DO. IT CAME TODAY TO TESTIFY. CAN TAKE THAT PASSION. AND HELP OUR YOUNG CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR MOTHERS AT THE BORDER WHO ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN CAGES THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY RIGHT NOW FOR THIS BILL. IS THE ABILITY FOR WOMEN TO HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND THAT NOT ALL UNIVERSITIES ARE PLACES HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THESE CLINICS NEARBY NOT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO CARS TO TRANSPORTATION. AND THE EASIER WE MAKE IT. IS A BETTER CHOICE FOR WOMEN AND I DO UNDERSTAND AND KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S POWERFUL. AND THAT THE ORANGE THAT DO WORK AT THE CENTER ALSO SERVED AS COUNSELORS AND CAN PROVIDE. THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS NEEDED WHEN MAKING THIS INCREDIBLY TOUGH CHOICE SO AGAIN THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE TO TESTIFY TODAY. MEMBERS OF THE LABOR. PARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TOPIC CONVERSATION TO S.. AND OUT YOU KNOW THIS THERE'S A STRONG DEBATE HERE ABOUT CHOICE AND. REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND I GET THAT BUT YOU KNOW FRANKLY MOST THE TIME THAT WE MEET IN THIS HEALTH COMMITTEE. IT'S ABOUT ACCESS TO CARE AND PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. BASIC CARE PRIMARY CARE. I WOMEN'S HEALTH REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES. AND I'M THINKING ABOUT THE ROLE I DO OVERSEEING THAT FUNDING FOR OUR UC'S IN CS USE STUDYING THAT POPULATION. THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDENTS VERY LOW INCOME. LOOK AT CSU NEARLY TWO THIRDS. VERY LOW INCOME. AND SO THIS TO ME ISN'T ABOUT CHOICE REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES ABOUT. HOUSE AND HAVE NOTS NEXT IF YOU HAVE MONEY. YOU CAN AFFORD TO GET ANY CARE YOU WANT. AND IF YOU DON'T YOU HAVE TO GET ON A BUS MAYBE GO OF SIXTY MINUTES. ACROSS TOWN EVEN IF HE IF HE IF YOU HAVE THAT OPTION IT MAY MAYBE TO HAVE A CARD ANOTHER CARD SO. IT'S REALLY. THAT ISSUE AS FAR AS. ACCESS TO UP TO TWO TO HEALTH CARE AND. SOME HAVE IT SOME DON'T AND I THINK THE CALIFORNIA BE MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY. HOW DOES HAVE ALL THE OPTIONS THAT THE TO SIR THANK YOU? THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER. IT WAS MISTER IS AREA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER OF FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I APPRECIATE. THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THIS. I I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T POINT OUT THAT. I HOPE THE FUNDING ELEMENT OF IT GETS WORK DOWN. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE LONG TERM. UPSIDE TO HOPE THAT THAT. GETS WORKED OUT AT SOME POINT. OTHERWISE. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE INTENTION TO BE STATED THAT AT SOME POINT IT'LL BE TURNING OVER TO. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED WHICH I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF. THAT SAID I ALSO JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT AND SAY THANK YOU TO. EVERYONE WHO DID SHOW UP SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT EVEN IF YOU HEAR. A. OPINIONS THAT YOU OPPOSE OR DO NOT AGREE WITH. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO A TO RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF FOLKS LISTENING TO WHERE THEY WERE COMING FROM WHETHER IT WAS. LOS ANGELES RANCHO CUCAMONGA OR SAN DIEGO OR. AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE. TOOK THE TIME TO BE HERE TO MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD SO I DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE EVERYONE SHOWING UP. REGARDLESS OF. WHERE WE MAY FALLING OUR VIEWS? SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. AND. ASIDE FROM THE AT. ISSUE WHICH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY SPOKE OF. I GUESS THIS IS TO SOMEWHAT. MAYBE GIVE COMFORT TO TO THE YOUNG LADY WHO WAS SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION. IN AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THIS YOU WON'T HAVE TO THEN BE. AND. THE BACKSIDE OF A GROCERY STORE. AND A COLD ENVIRONMENT WAITING. IT'LL BE IN A PURE ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENT. SO I DO HOPE YOU SEE THAT BENEFITS ALSO. OF WITH THIS PROVIDES SO WITH THAT I THINK YOU THINK YOU SOME A MEMBER. ANYONE ELSE. YOUR BIGELOW. YEAH I JUST WANTED A LITTLE FOLLOW UP ON THE FUNDING COMPONENT. TO THE AUTHOR. YOU'VE GONE TO A GREAT DEAL OF THE EXTENT TO. BASICALLY SHOWCASED THIS BILL AS IN NO COST TO THE. PUBLIC SECTOR IF YOU WILL FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN FACT IT GOES FAR TO STATE. IN AT NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS MUST BE OBTAINED WE HEARD TODAY AND TESTIMONY THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN OBTAINED AT THIS POINT. BUT THERE'S AN ELEMENT WITHIN YOUR BILL THAT TALKS. ON PAGE SIX. IF WE GO DOWN TO LINES TWENTY THROUGH TWENTY TWO. WHERE IT SPECIFICALLY STATES IN HERE NOTHING IN THIS CHAPTER SHALL BE INTERPRETED AS REQUIRING A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY? TO UTILIZE GENERAL FUND MONIES OR STUDENT FEES FOR THE MEDICATION ABORTION READINESS. BEFORE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWO. BUT YOU'RE SILENT AFTER THAT. WHICH LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDING SPONSORED. ACTIVITIES LEADING TO THE ABORTION. HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT AND CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE SO IT STAYS IF IF THIS WAS YOUR TRUCK IT WAS TO HAVE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDING? SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION SOMEONE MEMBER SO THAT IS WHAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON THAT EACH CAMPUS WILL BE TRAINED ON HOW TO BILL FOR THIS PROCEDURE. SO THEY WILL BILL AND THEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT THOSE MONEY SO THAT THERE WON'T BE THE MONEY THAT'S NEEDED FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE YOU KNOW MY HISTORY GOES BACK QUITE A WAYS WITH. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE LOCAL HEALTH. CLINICS AND AND. WHAT TYPICALLY? GENERALLY HAPPENS IS THE HEALTH CARE FOLKS HAVE VERY SYMPATHETIC HEARTS. AND THE WIND UP OVER PROMISING AND OVER PLEDGING RESOURCES. TO THE POINT THAT THERE ARE ON THE BRINK OF FULL COLLAPSE THERE FOR. THE LOCAL BOARDS WIND UP HAVING TO UTILIZE THEIR GENERAL FUND TO SUBSIDIZE. THOSE ACTIVITIES I WONDER SINCE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS. THE COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. OUR PUBLICLY FUNDED. WILL THEY NOT BE DOING THE SAME THING WITH OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS. BUT I WOULD A RESPONSE I WOULD SAY THIS EVERY YEAR AT THE C. ISSUES COME TO US AND ASK FOR MONEY. AND EVERY YEAR WE GENEROUSLY GIVE THEM MONEY THAT'S WHY WE'VE CREATED A PATH FOR THEM TO TRAIN THESE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT FUNDING SOURCE. SO SOME I GUESS MY CLOSING COMMENT. WOULD BE. I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT. FOR THE REFINING SO THAT WE LIMIT THAT COMPLETE ABILITY FOR THEM TO USE THE PUBLIC SECTOR FUNDS. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO LOOK AT DOING THAT AND AND CLOSING THAT LOOPHOLE. EN OPEN EXPOSURE ON THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. WE DON'T SEE IT IS A LOOPHOLE BUT I'LL ACTUALLY REEVE AB ABSOLUTELY REVIEWED AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOTHING I'VE MISSED. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. IN NO ONE BRING IT BACK TO YOU FOR YOUR AFTERNOON CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO TESTIFY BOTH IN SUPPORT. AN OPPOSITION OF WHAT I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY TO PEOPLE THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION AND THIS IS WHY WE'RE ALSO LUCKY TO LIVE WHERE WE LIVE. ABORTION IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IN ABORTION ARE YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ABORTION IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT MAKING SURE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY SAID THAT ALL WOMEN HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A VERY EMOTIONAL ISSUE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. BUT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT WOMEN CHOOSING WHEN THEY INCORPORATE A FAMILY INTO THEIR LIFE. IF WE TRULY WANT WOMEN TO BE EQUAL PARTNERS IN THIS WORLD WE MUST MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THAT CHOICE THEY HAVE THE CHOICE NOT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. THEY HAVE A CHOICE TO HAVE AN ABORTION IS ARE BOTH ARTICULATE YOUNG WOMEN WHO CHOSE DIFFERENT COURSES AND WILL BOTH BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR LIFE BUT THEY CHOSE OF COURSE. AND THEY CHOSE WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO WITH THEIR BODY WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER LEYVA AND I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES WHO CAME FROM FAR AND WIDE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TO TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS TODAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING ON A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE. AND FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT ACCESS. IT IS ABOUT CHOICE AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT FORWARD RECOGNIZE THAT ACCESS NOT CHOICE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE BUT FOR THOSE WHO WHO NEED WHO WANT. TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THESE CRITICAL SERVICES I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S. IMPORTANT THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD.

THREE TWENTY THE MOTION WAS MADE BY MISTER THURMAN THE SECOND WAS MADE BY MR MCCARTY JUST FOR THE RECORD. MR PARTICULAR SWITCHED YOU DON'T MIND. BE EASIER ON YOU IT'S ALL GOOD THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE. FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND YOUR STAFF. AND THE SPONSORS TO GET THE BELT WHERE IT IS TODAY. I'M PRESENTING S. B. THREE NINE NINE WHICH WILL ELIMINATE SIGNIFICANT ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS IMPOSED BY HEALTH PLANS. THAT ARE PREVENTING WITH FAMILIES PREVENTING FAMILIES FROM ACCESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM. THE BILL ALSO CODIFIES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A CALLOUS A QUALIFIED AUTISM SERVICE PROFESSIONAL AND PARA PROFESSIONAL TO ENSURE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. STATISTICS TELL US THAT ONE IN FIFTY NINE CHILDREN FOR TODAY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY TO HELP THESE CHILDREN'S LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL ADDITIONALLY HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT IS CRITICAL. NOT ALL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM ARE THE SAME. THEY RESPOND TO TREATMENT DIFFERENTLY CHILDREN NEED TREATMENT TAILORED TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SCRIBE TREATMENT BY THEIR PHYSICIAN OR PSYCHOLOGIST WHO KNOWS THEM BASS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TREATMENT. SEVEN YEARS AGO S. B. NINE FORTY SIX PASSED THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM. IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS BUT MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FROM RECEIVING ITS BENEFITS. BECAUSE OF A I BELIEVE A DRAFTING ERROR AN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS NOT EVERY CHILD IS RECEIVING COVERAGE. FOR THE TREATMENT THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS PRESCRIBE THAT. THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING DENIED COVERAGE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBED. EVIDENCE BASED CARE THIS IS COVERAGE THEY OR THEIR EMPLOYERS HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR BUT INTO MANY CASES. THE PARENTS ARE STATE ARE LEFT TO COVER THE COST OF THIS CRITICAL CARE S. B. THREE NINE NINE SEEKS TO CORRECT THIS ERROR. IN S. B. NINE FOUR SIX TO MAKE SURE EVERY PERSON WITH AUTISM HOUSE OUR HOUSE HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THEIR MEDICALLY PRESCRIBED TREATMENT. THIS BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM ACROSS THE STATE. RECEIVED OVER THREE HUNDRED LETTERS FROM PARENTSAND SUPPORT AS WELL AS AND BY THE WAY I DIDN'T BRING ALL THREE HUNDRED OF THEM I FIGURED. YOU HAD YOUR FILL OF HALLS BEING FELT TODAY. BUT WE COULD HAVE LETTERS FROM PARENTS AND SUPPORT AS WELL AS NUMEROUS AUTISM ORGANIZATIONS AND PROFESSIONALS IN ADDITION THE BILL IS CO SPONSORED BY THE AUTISM BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. SPECIAL NEEDS NETWORK THE AUTISM DESERVES EQUAL COVERAGE FOUNDATION AND THE DIR FOR TIME COALITION OF CALIFORNIA THE SPONSORS REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR TREATMENT PROVIDERS. AS A PARENT. I THINK ABOUT WHEN MY CHILD HAS ISSUES I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO SEE TREATMENT THAT WILL BENEFIT. MY CHILD IN EVERY OTHER CHILD NOT EVERY SIZE FITS ALL BOXES NOT EVERY CHILD SHOULD FIT IN ONE SIZE OF TREATMENT OR TALKING ABOUT MEDICALLY NECESSARY. DOCTOR PRESCRIBED TREATMENT I HAVE WITH ME JIM LACHEY FROM THE D. I OUR COALITION OF CALIFORNIANS AND APPARENT CHRISTIAN CHANEL OF WHO HERE TO ADD THEIR PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOULD OF MY NAME'S JIM LATCHAM WITH THE D. OUR FLOOR TIME COALITION OF CALIFORNIA BUT I REPRESENT ALL FOUR CO SPONSORS. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT AS AS WAS POINTED OUT IN THE. THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS AUTISM ORGANIZATIONS FROM AROUND THE STATE INCLUDING THE AUTISM SOCIETY OF CALIFORNIA THAT SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. REPRESENTING THE WHOLE CROSS SECTION OF THE AUTISM COMMUNITY AYE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IS IS QUITE POINTED TO A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS IT IS A WONDERFUL THING. IT. HELPS CHILDREN A REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND. IT'S IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ALLOW CHILDREN. EARLY INTERVENTION TO REACH THAT POTENTIAL. TO TO TO HELP PRODUCTIVELY IVES. TO TO REACH THEIR FULL PROMISE. UNFORTUNATELY. AFTER SENATE BILL NINE FORTY SIX WAS PASSED. THE PROMISE OF NINE FORTY SIX WASN'T FULLY REALIZED. THERE WERE TOO MANY OBSTACLES OF SOME OF THE WORK DRAFTING ERRORS. BECAUSE THE BILL WAS WRITTEN AT THE AND THE WANING HOURS OF THE SESSION WE WE HAD TO WRITE THE BILL THOUGH LAST MINUTE. TO GET IT UNDER THE WIRE BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WENT INTO EFFECT. AND THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT PROBABLY IF WE WERE WRITING THAT TODAY WE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN DIFFERENTLY. THIS BILL. CORRECTS SOME OF THOSE ERRORS. IT TRIES TO FIX IT SO THAT MORE CHILDREN CAN GET TREATMENT. IT ADDS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE ALREADY REGULATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ALREADY RECOGNIZE IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE. PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING WITH REGIONAL CENTERS TO WORK WITH CHILDREN WITH AUTISM AND ALLOWS THEM TO BE COVERED UNDER HEALTH INSURANCE TO PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT. IN OTHER FORMS OF AUTISM TREATMENT OTHER THAN JUST SIMPLY ARE APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS. WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT. BE ABLE HEALTH TREATMENT BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE AS SENATOR PORTANTINO SAID CHILDREN ARE DIFFERENT. THERE WAS A MOTHER WHO WANTED TO BE HERE THIS MORNING CHRISTMAS AFTERNOON TO SPEAK WITH YOU UNFORTUNATELY SHE COULDN'T GET CHILD CARE AND. SHE HAS TWIN BOYS WITH AUTISM. ANYBODY WHO HAS A CHILD WITH AUTISM WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT'S CRITICAL. BUT. SHE HAS TWIN BOYS WITH AUTISM AND THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT. SHE. RESPONDED VERY WELL TO APPLY BEERBOHM ALICE'S THE OTHER ONE DIDN'T. SHE WENT BACK TO OUR DOCTOR SAID HE KICKS HE SCREAMS HE YELLS COULD HE HE'S HE'S REGRESSING. THE DOCTOR DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND ANOTHER EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT. PRESCRIBED THAT FOR HIM AND HE DID DO VERY WELL UNDER IT UNFORTUNATELY. IT WASN'T COVERED BY INSURANCE SAID THIS IS NOT COVERED. SO I'M NOT GONNA DO IT SHE WENT BACK TO HER REGIONAL CENTER THE REGIONAL CENTER SAID YOU'VE BEEN PRESCRIBED THIRTY HOURS A WEEK A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT HURT YOU'VE BEEN PROVIDED. COVERAGE FOR THIRTY HOURS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IT'S ABA WORK THAT'S THAT'S FINE. AND STATE OF THE SIX HOURS OF DIR THAT. YOUR DOCTOR PRESCRIBED THAT'S FINE SHE PEELED IT. TEN SECONDS SHE APPEALED IT. SHE ONE STATES NOW PAIN FORT THE KIDS DOING MARVELOUSLY. THE POINT IS THE STATE'S PAIN FORT THE KIDS DOING WELL. IF THE PROFESSIONALS HAD BEEN THERE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. THEN THE. CLEARER. INSURANCE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID FOR IT AS WAS. SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THE CHILD WOULD BEEN DONE AND THIS IS HAPPENING THOUSANDS OF TIMES. PLEASE PASS THIS BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOODS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRIS SINCE CANNELLA I LIVE IN MILL VALLEY AND I'M A MOTHER FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY GIRL TWINS MARK ON THE LIVE. BOTH OF WHOM WERE NEUROTYPICAL AND AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER FRANCESCA WHO'S ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. I'M A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST I HAVE A MASTERS IN CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND A PHD IN CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY. WITH A CONCENTRATION BOTH IN NEUROPSYCHOLOGY IN PSYCHOANALYTIC PSYCHOTHERAPY. I HAVE DRIVEN HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THE STORY FRANCESCA WHO BY FOUR MONTHS WAS IN PHYSICAL THERAPY BY NINE MONTHS IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AND SOON AFTER IN SPEECH THERAPY. ALTHOUGH I WAS A NEW MOTHER I UNDERSTOOD FROM THE BEGINNING THAT SHE WAS NOT DEVELOPING IN A TYPICAL MANNER. FROM AGES ZERO TO SEVEN FRANCESCO OFTEN HAD SEVEN OR EIGHT FAIR BEATS PER WEEK. BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AS A CLINICIAN IN AS HER MOTHER. THE ONLY THERAPIES THAT EVER MADE SENSE FOR HER WERE THE DEVELOPMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BASED THERAPIES SHE CRAVED REAL CONNECTION AND UNDERSTANDING HER WORLD. IN ADDITION TO HER WEEKLY AND OFTEN TWICE WEEKLY OTP T. AND SPEECH THERAPIES. HERE JUST A FEW OF THE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS I PUT TOGETHER FOR HER DURING HER EARLY YEARS. SHE ATTENDED A FULL INCLUSION PRESCHOOL IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE TEACHERS WERE ALSO EXPERTS AND DEVELOPMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BASED THERAPIES FOR CHILDREN ON THE SPECTRUM. SHE HAD YEARS OF DEVELOPMENTAL RELATIONSHIP RELATIONAL ONE ON ONE THERAPY AS WELL AS TWICE WEEKLY RELATIONSHIP BASED PLAY THERAPY IN OUR HOME WITH TWIN GIRLS WHO ARE FRANCESCA'S AGE BUT WHO WERE NEUROTYPICAL. I ALSO TRAVELED REGULARLY TO THE MIND INSTITUTE TO MEET WITH AN INCREDIBLE DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN AND HER TEAM OF THERAPISTS ROOTED IN RELATIONSHIP BASED INTERVENTIONS. ALL OF THIS IS YOU CAN IMAGINE WAS VERY TIME CONSUMING AND VERY COSTLY. BUT FRANCESCA'S WORLD WAS OPENING UP. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF LIFE SHE HAD THERAPIST WHO USE THESE DEVELOPMENTAL IN RELATIONSHIP THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES TO HELP HER EXPAND HER CIRCLES OF COMMUNICATION. OUR INTERESTS HER PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND WHO THEREFORE DEEPENED HER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD. FRANCESCA WILL TURN NINETEEN THIS SUMMER. SHE IS NOW AN ADULT WHO HAS FRIENDSHIPS WHO TRAVELS BY HERSELF TO THE EAST COAST TO VISIT FAMILY. WHO USED TO TAKE THE TRAIN REGULARLY IN THE GRAND CENTRAL STATION AND MEET HER FATHER WHO GOES AWAY TO SUMMER CAMP WHO WORKS AT A PRESCHOOL WHO APPLIES TO JOBS ALL THE TIME? IS A T. A IN HER CLASS SHE COOKS CLEANS DOES LAUNDRY GOES ALL OVER MARIN COUNTY IN THE BUS BUT OF COURSE WOULD PREFER UBER. CHAU GRADUATE NEXT YEAR. FROM HIGH SCHOOL SHE WANTS TO GO TO COLLEGE TO BECOME A NURSE'S ASSISTANT. THAT MAY BE A REACH BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE TO CLOSE THE DOOR ON HER. FRANCESCA IS WHERE SHE IS NOW BECAUSE SHE RECEIVED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT THAT IS NOT COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE BUT SHOULD BE. SHE RECEIVED TREATMENT THAT ALLOWED HER TO GROW INTO A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY AND THERE ARE SO MANY FRANCESCA'S OUT THERE I'VE WORKED WITH THOSE FAMILIES IN MY PRIVATE PRACTICE. I'VE HEARD THE PLIGHTS OF HUNDREDS OF MOTHERS WHO WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR CHILD BUT CANNOT AFFORD IT. FRANCESCA IS LIVING PROOF OF THE POWER OF EVIDENCE BASED DEVELOPMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BASED APPROACHES. AND I KNOW WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT SHE IS ONLY WHERE SHE IS TODAY BECAUSE OF ALL OF HER YEARS OF EARLY RELATIONSHIP BASED INTERVENTION. THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. CERTAIN ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. WHERE WE HAVE? WE HAD. WAS A HAVE SUPPORTED HIM ESPECIALLY THOSE I'M SORRY I WASN'T IT IN ME TO JUMP THE GUN PLEASE I'M SORRY. FOREHEAD. LIZ WELL THEN SPEECH PATHOLOGISTS HEAD OF SCHOOL THE HELIX SCHOOL I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS DESERVE THE SERVICES. YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION. LIZ MCDONOUGH CLINICAL DIRECTOR OF THE HELIX SCHOOL. MARGARET MORRIS FOUNDER. OF THE HEALING SCHOOL. AND A SON WITH AUTISM. IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. POSITION. YEAH. SO WE HAVE TO WITNESSES THREE MINUTES IN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISSY JOHNSON HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS IS A TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS PROVIDERS OF AB SERVICE SAYS. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY MATT MCCLEARY WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS A BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE SPONSORS OF THE LEGISLATION THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL ARE PROBLEMATIC TO US FOR RIGHT HERE REASONS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT. THE LANGUAGE WAS NOT A DRAFTING ERROR IN BOTH THE ORIGINAL OF MANDATE LEGISLATION AND SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION THAT HAD BEEN INTRODUCED PREVIOUSLY THAT. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON OUR CONCERNS WITH SP SB THREE NINETY NINE CURRENTLY REVOLVE AROUND THE LANGUAGE RELATED TO THE QUALIFIED ARTISANS. PROFESSIONAL THE MIDDLE TIER IN OUR SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL. WHICH IS SUPERVISED BY A LICENSED OR CERTIFIED INDIVIDUAL BUT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO CREATE THAT'S LANGUAGE AND TEN SEVENTY FOR THE PAST LAST YEAR TO SUPERVISE INDEPENDENTLY PARA PROFESSIONAL LEVEL FOLKS. OF MANY PEOPLE WITH AUTISM AND RELATED DISORDERS EXHIBIT BEHAVIORS OF DIRECTLY JEOPARDIZE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. SUCH BEHAVIOR IS OFTEN RESULT IN COSTLY LARGELY INEFFECTIVE USE EDUCATION EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES HOSPITALIZATIONS. RESIDENTIAL SERVICES ETCETERA. SUBSTANTIAL YOU SHOULD RESEARCH SHOWS THAT COMPETENTLY DESIGNED AND DELIVERED INTERVENTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING PROBLEM BEHAVIORS. CONVERSELY RESEARCHERS SHOWN THE INTERVENTIONIST TO LACK SUFFICIENT TRAINING CONNECTION INCREASE THE OCCURRENCE OF BEHAVIORS OF PEOPLE WITH AUTISM. OUR MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT THE POOL OF PROVIDERS HAS BEEN EXPANDED SIGNIFICANTLY. TO INCLUDE IN TERMS AND A SYSTEM LEVEL FOLKS WHO HAVE. LITTLE COURSEWORK LITTLE SUPERVISION IN THEIR. EXCUSE ME THERE SUPERVISED FIELD WORK AND LITTLE CONTENT ON THEIR LICENSURE EXAMS OF REGARDING. BEAVER NELSON TREATMENT LOTS OF THEM. SO WITHOUT SUFFICIENT MINIMUM STANDARDS PRACTICE COMPETENTLY CONSUMERS ARE AT AN INCREASED RISK OF HARM FROM INDIVIDUALS MAKING FALSE CLAIMS. TO BE QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THE AUTHORING SPONSORS HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS AT THE PARA PROFESSIONAL LEVEL. TO SEPARATE THE CRITERIA FOR THOSE PROVIDING APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYTICS SERVICES. AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENTS. THE ENDS OF WELL WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT CONFUSIONS COULD COST REGULATORS AND FUNDERS WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS TO CONSIDER DOING THE SAME FOR THAT A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL. THAT FREE TIME. I GOOD AFTERNOON I CHAIRMAN WOULD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON JENNIFER ALLEN WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS. MIGHT WANNA BE CLEAR THAT HEALTH PLANS CURRENTLY COVER APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. BY SCIENTIFIC A SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN APPROACH AS RECOMMENDED BY BEST PRACTICE GUIDELINES. THIS BILL RECENTLY AMENDED A AND AMENDED AGAIN FIGHT WITH EVEN WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WOULD REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO COVER TREATMENT TYPES OUTSIDE OF APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. THAT ARE EXPERIMENTAL AND NOT RECOMMENDED FOR AUTISM CARE. YOU KNOW MANAGED CARE RELIES ON ENSURING THAT AND RELEASE RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE SERVICE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND THAT MEANS THAT MUST ADHERE TO CLINICAL GUIDELINES. WE THEREFORE MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL. ITS EXPANSIVE AND COSTLY MANDATE BILL BECAUSE IT IGNORES CURRENT. MEDICAL EDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND BEST PRACTICE GUIDELINES. AND SO WE'RE JUST VERY VERY CONCERNED. AND WE APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE REGARDING THE PAIR PARTICIPATION WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THOSE AMENDMENTS I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL REMOVE OPPOSITION OUR CONCERNS WITH THAT SECTION OF THE BILL. YOU KNOW. AS FOR THE LOCATION LANGUAGE AS A CLARIFICATION LANGUAGE THAN PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF AMENDMENTS OF THE BELT KIND OF TRIED TO CLARIFY THAT HEALTH PLANS WOULD NOT PAY FOR SERVICES PAID BY SKIP SCHOOLS. STILL AND THE LIMITATION TO THE PLAN SERVICE AREA STILL CAUSES SOME CONCERN. YOU KNOW OUR PLANS AND OUR CLINICIANS AB THE HEALTH PLAN UTILIZED VARIOUS TOOLS TO EVALUATE WHAT PLANTS ARE COVERING IT TYPICALLY HEALTH PLANS COVER CARE IN PROVIDER OFFICES STATE PROGRAMS CLINICS AND AND THEN RELEASE HOME WHEN IT COULD BE. PROPERLY STRUCTURED TO SUPPORT THE OPTIONAL BENEFIT FOR THE CHILD. TOM YOU KNOW THE LIMITATION ON HEALTH PLANS ABILITY TO REVIEW REGARDING PARENT PARTICIPATION AND THE LOCATION REMAINS A PROBLEM. YOU KNOW IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT A CHILD. WHICH. DOES BETTER WHEN THEIR PARENTS PARTICIPATES IN THEIR CARE IN EVEN THOUGH WE'VE ADDED LANGUAGE AMENDMENTS TO SAY THAT IT'S CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE. I WOULD ARGUE WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEDICAL LITERATURE THAT SAYS THAT IT IS CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THE PARENT TO BE ENGAGED. AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S SOMETHING AND IT'S A REAL CONCERN FOR US. AND WE ECHO THE CONCERNS ON WATERING DOWN THE PROVIDER REQUIREMENTS THAT WAS DISCUSSED BY. THE WITNESSES PRIOR TO BE THINKING. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION DISTRICT NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. STEPHANIE WATKINS ON THE HAVE THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES ALSO. THE ONLY BE DRAWN WITH WHICH YOU CUT CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. Q.. KEPT CAPTIVE MUST REVERSING THE LOCAL PLANS TO CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. JOHN WHEN YOU'RE ON THE F. AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS ARE STRUGGLING OPPOSITION. MICHELLE HI I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM FOR BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU ALL MELISSA COURT HAS ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR AUTISM RELATED DISORDERS I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WHILE WE DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS. THAT WAS OUTLINED BY KELLY ABA WE'VE YOU THE IN THEM THAT'S AS A COMPROMISE TO SORT OF SEPARATE OUT SEPARATE OUT THOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. AND WHAT MAY BE OTHER EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS THANK YOU. PRE PACKED COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WAS YOUR BILL AMENDMENTS. MR IS AARON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I CARRIED A SIMILAR BILL TO THIS. I THINK A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. AND AND I. SO WHAT COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE% ARGUMENTS MADE AT THAT TIME AND I THINK. THIS IS BEEN A BILL THAT'S EVEN WORKED AND BE COME TO A BETTER PLACE THAN THE ONE I WAS WORKING ON. SO I'M I'M SUPPORTING IT I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND. I I I SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS HAVE STILL STAYED THE SAME. AND EVEN WHEN I'M READING IT AND LOOKING AT. YOUR SAYING THAT IT'S EXPAND THE AT SCHOOL WATER DOWN BUT IT'S ALSO RAISED COSTA HOW'S IT GONNA RAISE COSTS IF IT'S WATERED DOWN. BUT IS A LITTLE BIT OF CONTRADICTORY MESSAGES HERE SO. IF YOU WANT TO TOUCH ON IT BE HAPPY TO HEAR IT OUT BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT. EVEN WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE. THE ARGUMENTS ARE STILL THE SAME. SO. CARE TO ELABORATE OR. ADDRESS THAT. YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY TO SO IF. IF A PLAN IDENTIFIES THE PARENT IS A PARTICIPATING IN THEIR CHILDCARE FOR EXAMPLE. AND. THAT CHILD IS FAILING TO. PROGRESS IN THEIR TREATMENT GOALS MY WE'RE TALKING A YEAR EIGHTEEN MONTHS TWO YEARS INTO TREATMENT AND THEY'RE STILL HAVEN'T PROGRESSED AS THEY SHOULD BASED ON THEIR DIAGNOSIS AND. EXPERIENCE WITH APPLIED BEAT YOU KNOW WITH THAT THE. A PROVIDERS HAVE YOU COULD QUESTION IS IT BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE PARTICIPATING AND SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE PARENTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT CHILD DOESN'T PROGRESS. MY NUMBER'S CONCERN IS THAT THE HOURS THEY'RE CURRENTLY GETTING TWENTY HOURS OF ABA WEEK THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY. SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAVE TO. HAPPENED HER CURVE TO MAKE UP FOR THE DEFICIT THE PARAMOUNT PARTICIPATE IN THEIR TREATMENT AND THAT WILL INCREASE COSTS. AND. THROUGH THIS HAIRCUT MAY AT A ONE OF THE REASONS THE ARGUMENTS HAVE REMAINED THE SAME IS BECAUSE THE ISSUE HAS REMAINED THE SAME ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WATERING DOWN THE STANDARDS IS SIMPLY THIS IF YOU ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT QUALIFIED. TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND THERE'S NO DEMONSTRATED AYE IMPROVEMENT TO THE SERB ADD TO THE CHILD'S BEHAVIOR THOSE CHILDREN THEN AND UP REQUIRING ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NEEDED. HAD THEY RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT IS THE CORE OF OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE WATERING DOWN OF THE REQUIREMENTS. AS MATT AT THE ENUMERATED WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT OF THE THE WATER DOWN EDUCATIONAL IN SPIRIT. EXPERIENCE OR REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE BILL. Q.. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY RESPOND OR DO YOU WANT TO DO TO MY CLOTHES YOU CLOSE IF YOU DON'T ANSWER ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. A SERVICE WE DON'T. I'M JUST KIND OF FOLLOWING A KID ON OUR COLLEAGUE OVER HERE. ON COTS. MEDI CAL YOU FLY EXCLUDED MEDI CAL ON A REIMBURSEMENT COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO US. THAT'S EXISTING LAW. OKAY SOBRE WHY ARE WE NOT. WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAWS POSSIBLE IN OUR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHEN THE ORIGINAL LAW WAS DRAFTED THERE WAS A DRAFTING ERROR ON THE TREATMENT SIDE. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS SO WERE TRYING TO BE AS RESPECTFUL TO EXISTING LAWS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE BOARD AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE PROVISIONS. WITH RECOGNIZING THAT I SEE THE PLANS WHEN A PROBABLY RESPOND AS WELL. IF I COULD MISTER CHAIRMAN GRABBED HIM TO RESPOND. SURE. WHAT WOULD YOU MIND RESPONDING TO THAT? AND THANK YOU SO I MEDI CAL CURRENTLY COVERS ON AUTISM SERVICES IT'S IN THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT AND IT'S PART OF THE MEDI CAL CONTRACTS. THE RACIAL INITIAL AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION OTHER STEINBERG BELL SEVERAL YEARS AGO DID NOT INCLUDE MEDICARE BUT MEDI CAL WAS INCLUDED INCLUDED ARE ADDED. THAT COVERAGE WAS ADDED THROUGH BUDGET TRAILER BILL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THIS BILL YOU KNOW STATES THAT MEDIC HOUSE EXCLUDED BUT ACTUALLY ALL THE COSTS AND THE CONCERN ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE MY MEDI CAL MEMBERS ALSO HAVE. BECAUSE EVEN IF THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM THESE PROVIDER REQUIREMENTS AND THE CHANGES IT WILL. WITH CONTINUITY OF CARE IS MEMBERS GO FROM OUT OTHER COVERAGE BACK TO MEDI CAL THAT THESE UP PROVISION REQUIREMENTS WOULD ALSO LIKE. SO FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT. WELL MAYBE THAT CARS OF CLARIFIES I THINK THAT IF I DO YOU WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT. YEMENI RESPONSE TO. THOSE COMMENTS JUST COUNT IF NOT HAVE A SECOND. WELL I THINK. WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CLARIFYING THAT PIECE OF IT I MEAN YOU KNOW OUR OUR GOAL IS NOT TO UNDO. THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK IT'S JUST TO PROVIDE OPTIONS FOR PARENTS SO. YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN REACH OUT TO EVERYONE SERVICE EVERYONE I'M JUST WONDERING WHY YOU'RE EXCLUDING ONE SEGMENT. A SECTION. I AM SO BACK TO THE. PART ABOUT REQUIREMENTS HOUSE CHANGING THE PROVIDER REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHING DIFFERENT. FLOOR TIME PROVIDER TYPE REQUIREMENTS PUBLIC REIMBURSEMENT HELPING TO UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT? RIGHT NOW ONLY ONE TYPE OF TREATMENT. IT'S COVERED. SO IF YOU'RE A PARENT AND YOUR DOCTOR PRESCRIBES. ANOTHER TREATMENT THAT'S. EVIDENCE BASED MEDICALLY NECESSARY YOU HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR. OKAY SOME OF THE DEVELOP. MY NO SERVICES HAVE. CREATED A CRITERIA. IS THAT NOT PART OF THE FOLLOW UP. IS THAT NOT PART OF THE PROCESS SO WHAT'S BEEN LACKING HERE. WHERE WE MET THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S WHERE WERE THAT'S WHERE THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT ON DRAFTING ERROR VERSE NO TRACKING? IT'S OUR CONTENTION THAT WHEN THIS WAS ENVISIONED IT WAS NOT ENVISIONED AS A MONOPOLY. KATE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A MONOPOLY. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WHAT THE HEART OF THIS BILL IS VERY. IT'S BECOME. MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HIS ARYAN WE'VE WORKED. FOR FOUR YEARS I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DID IT FOR TWO. AND THEN FOR THE LAST TWO. WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THE NUANCES AND THE CONCERNS BUT THE HEART OF THE BILL IS VERY SIMPLE. THE HEART OF THE BILL IS YOUR PHYSICIAN. PRESCRIBES A MEDICALLY NECESSARY. EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT. AND WHETHER THAT SHOULD BE COVERED ARE NOT COVERED UNDER EXISTING LAW ONLY ONE IS COVERED. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE A CHILD OR GRANDCHILD AND THAT CHILD'S PHYSICIAN. DESCRIBES A NOW THEIR TREATMENT. U. S. APPARENT DON'T HAVE TO SAY WELL I HAVE TO GO TO THIS ONE THAT MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE FOR THIS CHILD. BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT I GET REIMBURSED. SO WE'RE ANALYZE A COMPLEX SINCE EXISTING PROVIDER REQUIREMENTS WE ESTABLISHED BY THE DDS. IN FACT SAID THAT HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THE DDS. AND WHAT WERE SOME OF THEIR THOUGHTS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. YEAH. I'M SORRY I I DON'T SO I DON'T MEAN TO CATCH OFF GUARD IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER THAT'S FINE. THE PROBLEM LIES IN IN THE WAY THAT THROUGH THE. NINE FORTY SIX WAS WRITTEN IS THE PROVIDERS. THE WAY THE THE BILL DISK DEFINES A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IT SAYS ALL EVIDENCE BASE TREATMENTS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED BY A PHYSICIAN OR A PSYCHIATRIST. I AM SORRY PSYCHOLOGIST. BETTER. PROVIDED BY IN THAT IT GIVES THREE TIERS OF PROVIDERS THE FIRST PROVIDER EVERYBODY'S OKAY WHICH IS LICENSE HEALTH PROVIDERS DOCTORS. PSYCHOLOGISTS OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS COUNSELORS AND BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS FOR PROVIDE ABA. BUT THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE SERVICES THEY ACTUALLY SUPERVISE OTHERS WHO DO. THEN THE NEXT YEAR ARE THE PROFESSIONALS AND THAT'S WHERE WE RUN INTO THE PROBLEM. BECAUSE WE WERE WRITING THE THAT THAT BILL WAS WRITTEN LATE IN THE SESSION THEY TOOK THE EXISTING VENDOR CODES FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS FROM TITLE SEVENTEEN. AND ALL OF THOSE WERE ABA RELATED COATS AND THAT'S WHERE WE SAY WE CONTEND THAT IT WAS A DRAFTING ERROR. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A BE A TRAINED PROFESSIONALS FIVE THE ACTUAL CODE NUMBERS THAT WERE CITED IN THE ORIGINAL BILL AND NARROWED IT TO ONLY ONE TYPE AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND THEN. THE THIRD PROVIDE OF PROOF PROVIDER LEVEL LISTA PARA PROFESSIONAL. AND AGAIN IT'S CITED TO TITLE SEVENTEEN CODE AND AGAIN THOSE ARE ABA RELATED. COATS. AND AS A RESULT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES LOOKING AT SAYING WELL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE SERVICES. HAVE TO BE ABA TRAINED THERE FOR THE LEGISLATURE MUST ADMIT ABA AND SO IF YOU'RE PROVIDE IF YOU PRESCRIBE ANYTHING ELSE WE DON'T HAVE TO COVER IT. AND THAT'S AND THEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S NOT EVIDENCE BASED IT JUST MEANS THERE ISN'T ANYBODY TO PROVIDE SO BY PROVIDING THESE ALREADY REGULAR STATE REGULATED PROFESSIONS. WHO BY THE WAY ARE MASTERS LEVEL WORKING ON THEIR DOCTORATES AND WHEN THEY GET THEIR DOCTORS THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THE PROVIDER LEVEL THEY'RE ALREADY LISTED IN THE LEGISLATION IN THE PROVIDER LEVEL ONCE THEY GET THEIR DOCTORATES? BUT. THEY THEY'RE ALREADY WORKING WITH REGIONAL CENTERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES. THERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THEN THEY WILL EXPAND AND BE ABLE TO DO THAT THAT BUT THEY HAVE TO BE TRAINED IN THE EAST AND THE BAY REAL HEALTH TREATMENT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING. THAT WILL THEREIN LIES THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW VERY MUCH THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT MISTER CHAIRMAN AS. COULD COULD I ASK YOU BECAUSE I SEE THAT YOU GOODNESS THERE TO SPEAK. THANK YOU FOR READING THIS IF YOU CAN. HARD TO GET A COUPLE STEPS BACK I THINK AT THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE AND WE HAVEN'T BROUGHT UP THIS ARGUMENT THIS YEAR WE HAVE IN THE PAST. IS IT NOT FORTY SIX STATES THAT YOU CAN. FUND. FUNDERS TO PAY FOR APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS OR OTHER EVIDENCE BASED BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENTS. THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE FUNDERS HERE ARE SORT OF THE PROVIDERS. THE PLANS ARE NOT WILLING TO PAY FOR ANYTHING THAT THEY DO NOT TEAM EVIDENCE BASED. AND TO APPLY BEHAVE ANALYSIS HAS A RICH EVIDENCE BASED MANY OF THESE OTHER TREATMENTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED HERE. ARE HAVE FORTHCOMING EVIDENCE OR EMERGING EVIDENCE BUT THEY HAVEN'T REACH THAT THRESHOLD. AND AS IT RELATES YOUR QUESTION. REGARDING CHANGING AT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROVIDERS CHANGING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROVIDERS DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL THRESHOLD PROBLEM. ABOUT THESE OTHER TREATMENTS BEING EVIDENCE BASED. WITH THAT DISTRICT HANCOCK. IF. ANYONE ELSE. MISS WALDRON. I FEEL LIKE THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GET CLOSE HAVE A HOME. YOU'VE GOTTEN THROUGH SOME AMENDMENTS. I MEAN YOU'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. THIS IS GOES FORWARD WE WILL MEET WITH ANYONE ANYWHERE EVERY DAY. I THINK THAT MY CONCERN AND TRY AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL IS INVOLVED TO WHERE IT'S AT YEAH I MEAN WHAT WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS ALL THE TIME AND NOW. WHAT I'M PROVIDE THE SERVICE? AND THERE'S NO ISSUES WITH THE DEFINITION OF WHAT'S IN NO. THOSE CERTAIN TYPE OF TREATMENT VERSUS ANOTHER. ONE IN FIFTY I WANT TO SEE SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION I'M. STRUGGLING WITH. YOU KNOW. CAN WE GET THERE I DON'T KNOW BUT I. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU IN THE. THREE PLUS YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN FOR MAYOR WITH THIS PROCESS AND I GO BACK TO WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOES AREA HAD IT. BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF THE PARENTS THAT. WERE ADVOCATES FOR WHEN HE CARRIED THE BILL. IT HAS BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF FRANKLY. A MONOPOLY. WE HAVE TRIED AND WE HAVE TAKEN MANY MANY MANY SETS OF AMENDMENTS AND I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER HIS ARYAN DID. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY YOU HAVE A. PROVIDER WHO WANTS TO MAINTAIN A MONOPOLY BECAUSE. WE KEEP BOTH SAYING EVIDENCE BASED. AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL SAYS. SO IF. WE SUPPORT EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT THERE SHOULD BE NO DISCUSSION THERE SHOULD BE NO ARGUMENT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOCTOR PRESCRIBED. AGAIN THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL. IS IN CHARGE. OF THAT FAMILIES HEALTH. SAYING WE THINK YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER. WHAT RESPOND WELL TO THIS EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT OVER THIS ONE? IT SHOULD BE COVERED. BECAUSE THAT'S THE KEY POINT WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT EXPERIMENTAL RETIREMENT EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT. BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW. ONLY ONE OF THOSE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS QUALIFIES. FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE. THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PIECE SO WITHIN DEFINITIONS WERE OPEN TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE SHOWN THAT FOR TWO YEARS AND BEYOND. BUT AT SOME POINT. THERE'S A PHILOSOPHICAL DIVIDE OVER WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE A MONOPOLY. AND OFTEN TREAT ALL CHILDREN THE SAME WAY OR WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT EVERY CHILD IS DIFFERENT AND WHITE RESPOND TO DIFFERENT TREATMENTS DIFFERENTLY. UNDER THE CARE OF THEIR PEDIATRICIAN. WELL THAT'S WHY THEY SAY THIS POSSUM SPECTRUM BECAUSE NOT EVERY CHILD RESTING PLACE. I HAVE A VERY DEAR FRIEND WHOSE SON HAS AUTISM AN. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH. AND YOU'D WANT ESPECIALLY IN THE DEVELOPING YOU WANT TO GET THE TREATMENT TO THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE RIGHT AND IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE COMING A PUPPY. CORRECT LISTENING TO MUSIC YOU KNOW HAVING SOMEONE WHO CAN TEACH THEM. SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S NOT. TAKING A DRUG OR DAY MAYBE IT'S A COUNSELOR WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO. YOU KNOW BABIES LEARNING A SIGN LANGUAGE OR SOMETHING A DIFFERENT WAY TO COMMUNICATE. WHAT THEY'RE FEELING THAT WOULD HELP THEM HEAL SO THAT'S WHY I ADMIT THE FRUSTRATION AVOCET THAT FEEL LIKE IT COULD BE CLOSE? AND YOU'VE COME THIS FAR. SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK OUT I MEAN I I CAN'T TELL YOU. IF THERE'S A SPECIFIC PIECE OF LANGUAGE BUT WE HAD A MEETING YESTERDAY I MEAN WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. AND THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE OF WORKED AS WELL I MEAN. THIS IS THIS IS NOW THE SECOND. HEALTH COMMITTEE OF A SIX YEAR JOURNEY. THE MEMBERS. MANY MARK IF THANK YOU MISTER. MAYBE THIS WHOLE CRUX REVOLVES AROUND DDS IF THEY WOULD JUST SIMPLY. DO AN UPDATE TO THEIR REGULATIONS% AND MAKE IT CLEARER MIGHT BE HELPFUL. TO ALL PARTIES AFFECTED IS JUST RHETORICAL. ACT RESHAPE THE AUTHOR AND IN EVERYONE'S A COMMENT HERE TODAY. ANYONE ELSE. NO ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD TO THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I YOU KNOW. WHO AMONGST US DOESN'T KNOW A FAMILY OR HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO HASN'T BEEN AFFECTED? BY ARTISTS WHO AMONGST US DOESN'T HAVE. A RELATIVE OR TWO I MEAN I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEY ARE NIGHT AND DAY. COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY DIFFERENT HUMAN BEINGS. TO ME I'M ASKING YOU TO THINK OF THIS YES AS A LEGISLATURE. LEGISLATOR BUT ALSO THINK OF IT AS A PARENT A GRANDPARENT AN AUNT OR AN UNCLE. AND THINK ABOUT YOUR PEDIATRICIAN PULLING YOU INTO. YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER GRANDCHILD'S. ROOM AND SAYING I WOULD LIKE TO SEND THEM OUT TO A TREATMENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT COVERED BY YOUR INSURANCE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT INTO THE MONOPOLY BOX. BUT I THINK YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER WOULD RESPOND WELL. TO THAT TREATMENT. AND SO YOU DIG DEEP AND YOU PAY FOR THAT TREATMENT YOURSELF ALONE BEHOLD YOUR CHILD COMES HOME. AND ACTUALLY IS RESPONDING TO THAT OTHER TREATMENT BECAUSE IT IS EVIDENCE BASED BECAUSE THERE IS A FACILITY. IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND BECAUSE YOUR DOCTOR RECOMMENDED IT. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WELL I CAN'T AFFORD WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF MY CHILD. I HAVE TO GO. BECAUSE MY INSURANCE WILL ONLY PAY FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAY HELP ONE OF MY CHILDREN. BUT IS IT GONNA HELP ALL OF MY CHILDREN. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE A MONOPOLY ON A TREATMENT WHEN A CHILD'S WELL BEING IS AT STAKE. AND WE SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AFTER SIX YEAR JOURNEY AND TAKING MULTIPLE AMENDMENTS AND WORKING PASSIONATELY WITH LOTS OF STAKEHOLDERS TO GET THIS IN THIS POSITION AGAIN. MEDICALLY NECESSARY PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBED EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIBEL.

CENTER CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE TAT I WANT TO THANK SOME OF THE REALLY MOAN FOR HER A CO AUTHORSHIP OF THE RESOLUTION. AND. THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES INTERSECTS CALIFORNIANS HOT AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STATES DIVERSITY. OUGHT TO BE CELEBRATED. AS OPPOSED TO AN ABERRATION IN NEED OF CORRECTION. THE. RESOLUTION ALSO CALLS ON THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. TO. AVOID. MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERIES ON NEWBORNS. SO THAT CHILDREN CAN. WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND EXPRESSED THEIR GENDER AS OPPOSED TO HAVING AYE THAT DECISION MADE FOR THEM. WHEN THEY ARE A. B.. APPROXIMATELY ONE IN EVERY TWO THOUSAND BABIES IS BORN WITH EXTERNAL SEX CHARACTERISTICS OTHER NOT. CONSIDERED. UNDER TRADITIONAL. VIEWS AYE AYES TYPICALLY MALE OR FEMALE. I SUCH A BABY WOULD BE CONSIDERED I ENTER SOCKS AND STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICE WOULD BE TO ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. PERFORM NON CONSENSUAL INVENT SEX ASSIGNMENT SURGERY TO CONFORM THAT INFANTS BODY. OUGHT TO A TYPICAL QUOTE UNQUOTE NOTION OF MASCULINITY OR FEMININITY. ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS RISK OF A GETTING ASSIGNED TO THE WRONG GENDER. YOU CAN. SEE A SITUATION WHERE A DECISION IS MADE FOR A BABY AND I SURGERY IS. ABA FORM TO SIGN EITHER MALE OR FEMALE. SEX CHARACTERISTICS I KNOW NOT CHILD WHETHER THERE ARE FIVE OR TEN OR. WHENEVER THEY EXPRESS THEIR GENDER. EXPRESSES THE OPPOSITE GENDER AND THEN WE HAVE ANY REVERSIBLE. SURGERY ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS RISK ID'S I SURGERIES CAN LEAD TO PERMANENT LOST A LOSS OF SEXUAL SENSATION. STERILIZATION INCONTINENCE AND A VARIETY OF SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS UP TO AND INCLUDING PTSD. AND CHRONIC DEPRESSION. OTHER RUSHED TO PERFORM THE SURGERY ON INFANTS ARE COMES FROM A WE BELIEVE A MISGUIDED NOTION. THAT INTER SOCKS. PEOPLE OR INTERSEX BABIES NEED TO BE QUOTE UNQUOTE NORMALIZED. AS WELL AS A SENSE THAT THEY WILL BE BULLIED IF THEY'RE ALLOWED TO REMAIN PHYSICALLY ENTER SUCKS ACCLAIM FOR WHICH THERE IS ZERO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. ALTHOUGH A SMALL PORTION OF INTERSEX INFANTS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE MEDICAL INTERVENTION FOR A MEDICALLY NECESSARY REASON FOR EXAMPLE IN ABILITY. AYE TO URINATE OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE AYE INFANTS SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO GROW UP HEALTHY. AND TO DECIDE FOR-THEMSELVES WHETHER TO HAVE. THIS IRREVERSIBLE. SURGERY. TO PUT IT IN. EXCUSE ME ON SO THAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT. PEOPLE'S ABILITY. TO LIVE THEIR LIVES TO BE WHO THEY ARE AND NOT TO HAVE THAT DECISION MADE FOR THEM. AS A BABY OP BEFORE THEY ARE IN ANY WAY ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEMSELVES SO I SEE ARE ONE TEN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON RECORD. AYE IN SUPPORTING THESE CHILDREN AND SUPPORTING THE INTERSECTS COMMUNITY. AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES. SO WITH ME I TODAY I TESTIFY. IS. HAND LINDO WHO'S AN ACTIVIST WITH INTERACT AND AND A INTERSEX PERSON AND OUGHT TO SUE YOU TOMORROW MATT US A FAMILY PHYSICIAN ALSO WINNERS. THANK YOU SENATOR READER. GREAT MY NAME IS HAN THE DOLL I AM INTERACTS COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AS WELL AS A YOUNG INTERSEX PERSON AN ACTIVIST. I'M HERE I'VE COME ALL THE WAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO AS AN INTERSEX PERSON. AND I'M HERE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MY CONFIDENCE AND MY HAPPINESS ARE OWED TO THE FACT THAT I HAD MY OWN DECISION. IN RECEIVING GENITAL SURGERY. I MEAN MY CHOICE WHEN I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO CONSENT AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING MY PARENTS DID IT. MY DOCTORS DID IT. I DID. AND THESE TYPES OF SURGERIES ARE NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY. ANY TYPE OF SURGERY THAT MIGHT CHANGE APPEARANCE OR SEXUAL FUNCTION AND WHICH CARRIES VERY HIGH RISK OF FAILURE. MUST BE OUR OWN DECISION. ALL OF US. DESERVE A CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND OUR MEDICAL OPTIONS AND WHAT EFFECTS THEY MIGHT HOUSE. FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES. INTERSEX CHILDREN BORN WITH GENITAL DIFFERENCES RARELY GET THAT CHANCE. THE MOST DRASTIC AND INVASIVE OPTION IS CHOSEN FOR US BEFORE WE CAN EVEN SPEAK. AND I WANNA BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT ANTI SURGERY. WERE PRO CONSENT INTERSEX PEOPLE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE THIS DECISION FOR THEMSELVES. MEDICINE MUST SERVE THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT. NOT OTHERS WHO ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THEIR DIFFERENCES. TAKE CONVERSION THERAPY A PRACTICE THAT'S HARMFUL TO CHILDREN. AND IS CHOSEN ONLY TO EASE A PARENT OR AUTHORITIES SOCIAL DISCOMFORT. CONVERSION THERAPY HAS BEEN BANNED IN TWELVE STATES. UNNECESSARY GENERAL SURGERY ON INTERSEX KIDS IS PERFORMED FOR THE SAME REASON APPARENT AUTHORITIES SOCIAL DISCOMFORT. PARENTAL UNEASE OR THE MERE POSSIBILITY OF LOCKER ROOM BULLYING CANNOT JUSTIFY A DECISION WITH SUCH HIGH RISK TO THE PATIENT. WHAT IF YOU COULD NOT SEX IS AN ADULT BECAUSE OF A DECISION THAT SOMEONE MADE HE WAS A BABY? WHAT IF YOU WERE STERILIZED AS A BABY AND THAT DECISION WAS MADE FOR YOU? THESE ARE STORIES PLEASE PLEASE LISTEN TO INTERSEX PEOPLE SO THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE. PERHAPS SOME INTERSEX PEOPLE WILL BE GLAD THAT THEIR PARENTS MADE A SURGICAL DECISION FOR THEM AND THAT'S FINE THAT'S GREAT. BUT I AM HERE TO SPEAK FOR THE COUNTLESS OTHERS WERE MUCH LESS THAN CLOUT WHO SUFFER EVERYDAY. AND I KNOW MANY INTERSEX CALIFORNIANS. WHOSE LIVES WERE COMPROMISED BT SURGERIES THAT THEY DID NOT. SO. MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS OPPOSING THIS RESOLUTION MIGHT TALK ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPROVED. ABOUT HOW EARLY SURGERY IS JUSTIFIED IS ONE OPTION TO OFFER. THIS IS IRRELEVANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE COMMITTED WITH ALL TYPES AND QUALITIES OF TOOLS. THE QUALITY OF THE TOOLS AND CHANGE THE FACT THAT AN INFANT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONSENT TO LIFE ALTERING COSMETIC GENITAL SURGERY. CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY. THIS IS A HISTORIC FIRST STEP IN ALIGNMENT WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS GUIDELINES. BY SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION YOU STAND WITH ME. THE INTERSEX COMMUNITY HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH UNITED NATIONS EQUALITY CALIFORNIA A COUNTLESS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT STAND FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH. HI I'M CITY TORMENTAS. HIM. I'M A PHYSICIAN LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M A PARENT I'M INTERSEX PERSON. AND I AM URGING YOU TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE THE TIME HAS COME FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A STAND. PHYSICIANS DON'T LIKE TO TAKE FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T WEAR WHITE COATS. BUT I AM A PHYSICIAN. AND I KNOW HOW DESPERATELY IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY NEEDS A RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE NOT BROKEN. THE CRUX OF THE OPPOSITION AND I HAVE READ IT. IS THAT MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS ARE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE ADEQUATELY. AND THAT ALL OPTIONS NEEDED BE NEEDS TO BE ON THE TABLE FOR PARENTS. I URGE YOU TO RECOGNIZE REALITY THIS RESOLUTIONS NOT PROHIBIT SURGERIES IT MERELY ARTICULATES YOUR DESIRE TO SEE CALIFORNIA PUT INTO MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES. THAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO BE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THE PHYSICIANS ADVOCATING FOR THE SURGERIES IGNORED THAT THE LARGEST PATIENTS RIGHTS GROUPS. IN THE WORLD HAVE CALLED FOR THIS IS FOR SUPPORT AND SWIFT ACTION TO PROTECT. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THIS RESOLUTION INDICATES. TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AT THE EXISTENCE OF A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM DOES NOT MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE TO STERILIZE A HEALTHY TWO YEAR OLD OR CREATE A OR TO REDUCE. OF A THREE YEAR OLD GIRL. WE CANNOT ALLOW DOCTORS CONTINUES PRACTICE BASED ON THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES. BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND WITHOUT ANY RECOGNITION OF THE VALUES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I NEW PART OF THE REASON YOU'RE SITTING HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT FORMULA VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE STATE AND VOTER POPULATIONS OF HEALTH CARE. THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND TO CELEBRATE THE LOOT THE LIVES OF PEOPLE LIKE ME AND PEOPLE ICON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOHN MICHAEL FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS RESOLUTION WE THANK SENATOR WIENER FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD WE ARE AT YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMAN. AND. TO CHAIRPERSON AT MISTER WOOD MY NAME IS CYNTHIA JOHNSON AND I DROVE UP FROM CARLSBAD DE. YESTERDAY TO BE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SCR I WON TEN I THINK. MISTER WEINER FOR HIS EFFORTS IN THAT REGARD. AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M A FIFTY YEAR RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA. AND ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE OF BEING INTERSEX. I DIDN'T MISSION WAS NOT BORN IN CALIFORNIA CAME FROM ILLINOIS GREAT STATE OF ILLINOIS. BUT. HAVING BEEN BORN INTERSEX. MY PARENTS MY LOVING PARENTS. DECIDED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST THING TO DO TO HIM GET AWAY FROM THE LEERING. VIEWS AND WORRIES OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND MAKE A FRESH START HEARING CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID FIFTY YEARS AGO AND. I'VE BEEN DOING ADVOCACY WORK FOR. THEM THAT FIFTEEN YEARS MAYBE THAT TEN YEARS OR SO. AND. I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR TESTIMONY FROM PROFESSIONALS WHO. HAVE ALL KIND OF REASONS TO SAY THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE OPTIONS FOR SURGERY AND I AM NOT AGAINST ANY OF MY INTERSEX FRIENDS OR OTHERS THAT CHOOSE WITH CONSENT. DO YOU HAVE THOSE SURGERIES DONE ON THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE THOSE DECISION SHOULD NOT BE MADE ON THEIR BEHALF. AND SO. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS. I HOPE THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PARENTS REALIZE THAT CHILDREN ARE CHILDREN FOR A SHORT PART OF TIME WE'RE MOSTLY GONNA BE ADULTS IT FOR. GRANTED THAT THE GIFT OF TIME IN AGE WE'RE GOING TO BE ADULTS LONGER THAN WE'RE GONNA BE CHILDREN AND WE HAVE TO FIND THEIR WAY IN THIS WORLD AND. FIGURE OUT HOW TO LIVE IN THE BODIES THAT WERE GIVEN. AND. MANY OF YOU CAN PROBABLY. LIVED ATTEST TO THE CHALLENGES OF BODILY ISSUES AND. ILLNESSES AND THINGS THAT INFIRMARIES THAT. YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH AND INTERSEX PEOPLE ARE VERY RESILIENT WE'RE CAPABLE OF LIVING IN SOCIETY PRODUCTIVELY. AND FORMING RELATIONSHIPS AND HAVING A WONDERFUL LIFE AND. THAT HAPPENS BEST WHEN WE'RE LEFT ALONE TO MAKE THAT DECISION OURSELF SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NAME AND ORGANIZATION POSITION. NIKOLAY ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. REVEREND DR PAMELA ANDERSON MINISTER IN THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH USA AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT. NO ARTICULATING ARTIST AND WRITER FROM SAN FRANCISCO CONSTITUENTS STRONGLY SUPPORT. SHE HAS AREA IN A MEDICAL SCHOOL STAFF MEMBER AND CONSTITUENTS SACRAMENTO STRONGLY IN SUPPORT. Q.. MARLENA WALTERS CONSTITUENT OF SUSANVILLE STRONGLY SUPPORT. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AFTER. CHIEF OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGY AT YOU SEE YOURSELF. I'VE TAKEN CARE OF CHILDREN BORN WITH A TYPICAL GENITALIA AND DISORDERS OF SEX DEVELOPMENT FOR LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER. THEIR INTERESTS AND PROTECT THEM FROM STATE SENATOR WINTERS PROPOSED RESOLUTION AND US MISREPRESENTATION OF DISTORTION OF THE FACTS. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE HEARD STATE SENATOR WIENER MAKE THE STATEMENT. THE LAST WAS ON SATURDAY IN SAN FRANCISCO AT A TOWN HALL MEETING. THAT BABY IS BORN WITH A TYPICAL GENITALIA ARE OUR WISH TO THE OPERATING ROOM AND ASSIGN GENDER. THAT IS SIMPLY. DOESN'T HAPPEN. IN FACT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT EACH INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNS OUR OWN GENDER. IT'S NOT A SIGN BY DOCTORS IT'S NOT A SIGN BY NURSES HEALTH CARE WORKERS PARENTS IS NOT A SIGN BY SURGERY. AND IT CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T BE ASSIGNED BY ANY GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION. NO SENATOR WIENER BABIES AND CHILDREN ARE NOT NORMALIZED I REJECT THE TERM NORMALIZATION WHICH HAS NO RELEVANCE TO MY PATIENTS AND I WISH YOU WOULD AS WELL. CAN I AM EITHER FOR OR AGAINST SURGERY. I AM FOR THE PATIENT AND I'M FOR ACCESS TO ALL FORMS OF MEDICAL CARE FOR MY PATIENTS. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT I WORK WITH. AND WHO HELPED WITH MY PATIENCE. I'M COR BOARD WITH A TYPICAL GENITALIA ARE APPALLED. WITH THE RESOLUTION. THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORTH AS WELL AS MULTIPLE OTHER MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS. THIS ALSO INCLUDES PATIENTS FAMILIES. AND PATIENTS THEMSELVES FOR WHICH WE PROVIDE A TEST. I ASK YOU TO ENDORSE EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE SHARE DECISIONS DECISION MAKING AND RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF BOTH. PARENTS AND PATIENTS. SENATOR WIENER HOW ABOUT SPONSORING A BILL TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR PATIENTS BORN IN YOUR STATE WITHIN GENERAL TRAINOR HYPERPLASIA. OVERALL TESTICULAR SYNDROME. GONADAL DYSGENESIS FIVE ALPHA REDUCTASE AND GREAT INSENSITIVITY SYNDROME PERSISTENT ILARION DUCK SYNDROME. YES THOSE ARE COMPLICATED DIAGNOSES THEY INVOLVE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS WITH THE MEDICAL FIELD AND FAMILY SUPPORT. WE'RE HERE TO HELP SENATOR WIENER TRY TO DEFINE WHAT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH HIS CONSTITUENCY. PLEASE HELP US IMPROVE AND NOT LIMIT THEIR CARE. THE FACTS SHOW THE MEDICAL FACTS THAT NINETY PERCENT OF PATIENTS WHEN ASKED AS ADULTS TYPICALLY BEEN SATISFIED WITH YOUR CARE. WHO BEEN SATISFIED WITH THEIR CARE AND WOULD ADVOCATE THE SAME CARE AGAIN? STATE SENATOR WIENER I'M YOUR ADVOCATE. I LIVE IN YOUR DISTRICT. I VOTED FOR YOU. I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU LIKE TO TASK CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES. RESPECTFULLY. DABBLING IN THE COMPLEX CARE OF CHILDREN AND NOT RESPECTING THE RIGHTS. OF PARENTS AND RESTRICTING ACCESS THE CHILDREN IS NOT FOR YOU AND NOT FOR STATE GOVERNMENT. THIS RESOLUTION AND I KNOW IT'S JUST A RESOLUTION CAN HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO THE CARE OF CHILDREN IN RESPECT TO COVERING. THEIR HEALTHCARE. IN CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THEREFORE I'M STRONGLY OPPOSED. GENTLEMEN I'M ERIN SPITS METEOROLOGIST ON THE LEAD DELEGATE TO THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES. FOR THE AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. AND ALTHOUGH THE INTENTION OF THIS RESOLUTION IS TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO PRESERVE AND AFFIRM THEIR GENDER. UNFORTUNATELY WILL RESULT IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE OUTCOME. THIS IS BECAUSE THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO DRAFT THIS REVENUE RESOLUTION IS INCOMPLETE OUTDATED OR INCORRECT. CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA REPRESENTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN CURRENTLY RECEIVING SURGICAL CARE. IT IS NOT CONSIDERED INTERSEX BUT IT IS UNFORTUNATELY SUBJECT TO THIS RESOLUTION. IT'S A CONDITION THAT CAUSES TOO MUCH TESTOSTERONE TO BE PRODUCED BY THE ADRENAL GLAND AND INFANT GIRLS WHICH CAN RESULT IN THEIR EXTERNAL GENITALS LOOKING VERY MUCH LIKE A* AND*. BUT DESPITE THE EXCESS TESTOSTERONE THEY ARE GIRLS AND AS THEY GROW UP THEY IDENTIFY AS GIRLS. THEY'RE GENETICALLY FEMALE AND AS ADULTS THEY IDENTIFIES WOMEN IN WHEN THEY ARE SURVEYS THEY STATE THAT THEY ARE GLAD THAT THEY WERE PROVIDED SURGERY THAT ALLOW THEM TO GROW UP AS GIRLS. YOU HAVE LETTERS FROM THESE GIRLS AND FAMILIES BEFORE YOU NOW. THIS RESOLUTION WOULD FORCE THESE GIRLS TO GROW UP WITH THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND THAT'S IT DOES NOT MATCH THEIR IDENTITY WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE THEM A LIFETIME OF. PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND BODY DYSPHORIA. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DEFINES HEALTH AS QUOTE A STATE OF COMPLETE PHYSICAL MENTAL AND SOCIAL WELL BEING AND NOT MERELY THE ABSENCE ORDERED OF DISEASE OR INFIRMITY UNQUOTE SO THE SURGERIES ARE INDEED MEDICALLY NECESSARY. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL TURMOIL ENTERED BY THOSE ADULT PATIENTS WHAT A LESS THAN OPTIMAL OUTCOME FROM PAST SURGERY AND HAVE THE US BROUGHT THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. BUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS PAIN SHOULD NOT BE THE REASON TO DEPRIVE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING AN ENLIGHTENED AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH. LED US TO WE APPROACH ALL THESE CHILDREN WITH GREAT CARE INVOLVING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS MOTHER FATHER PEDIATRICIAN AND CHRONOLOGIES GENETICIST ETHICIST PSYCHOLOGIST. ADVOCATES AND SURGEON ALL COME TOGETHER TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND TRANSPARENCY ONE INDIVIDUAL AT A TIME THESE ARE NOT SNAP JUDGMENTS. WE SEEK AN AMENDMENT TO ALLOW CHILDREN WITH NOBLE GENDER IDENTITY SUCH AS CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA ACCESS TO SURGERY. SO THEY MAY LIVE A LIFE THAT IS AFFIRMING THEIR GENDER. THANK YOU. ACCURATE MUCH. OTHER OTHERS IN OPPOSITION TO YOUR NAME IN OREGON. DR LINDA SHORTLY. PAST CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF UROLOGY AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY PEDIATRIC UROLOGIST. NINETEEN SIXTY CENTS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT THANK YOU. DOCTOR ROGER DE FILIPPO CHIEF OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGISTS HOLDS HOSPITAL SANDERS WAY OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION. SERWIS BITS OF LAGUNA BEACH I OPPOSE THIS UP THIS. S.. ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU. I AND I I THINK YOU AS SENATOR WIENER FOR AS FAR AS YOU AND I HAD OUR. THE EARLIER IN THE YEAR TO TALK ABOUT THIS INCOME PART IT IT REALLY WAS TO HAVE A STATEMENT MADE ABOUT. I AFFIRMING GENDER AND ALLOWING IT TO BE. A FIRM THAT GENDER FOR THEMSELVES AND THERE WAS A QUESTION RAISED BY THE UP OR A COMMENT MADE BY THE OPPOSITE. IT WOULD AND THIS RESOLUTION A RESOLUTION WITH SEVERELY HARM. FOLKS CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY RESOLUTIONS NEARLY HARMING FOLKS. WELL THIS RESOLUTION. CAN PUT A CHILLING EFFECT ON HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE THE HOUSE SALARIES IT'S A RESOLUTIONS OUR HOUSE SO. WE RECEIVED EARLIER OUR SOCIETY. A LETTER FROM LAMBDA LEGAL THAT HAD A THREATENING TONE ABOUT LAWSUITS BEING BROUGHT AGAINST. PROVIDERS OF SURGERY. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT A RESOLUTION THAT STATES THAT THE SURGERY SHOULD NOT BE DONE ON. INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. WAIT. GIVE FIREPOWER TOSUCH LAWSUITS IF THEY WERE PROCEED TO YOU IMAGINE YOU'RE NOT SURE YOU'LL HAVE EVIDENCE. YOU'RE JUST IMAGINING THAT THIS WOULD. I'M QUITE CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD GIVE IT FIREPOWER. SOARING AND I HAVE. IS. WE HAVE NOT CAUCUS TO DEFINE WHAT MEDICALLY NECESSARY. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DISCUSSION. IT'S LOOKED UP FROM MANY BIT A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE SINCE PERSPECTIVE THAT I LOOK AT IT AND NOT THE PARENTS LOOK AT IT HIS THE SURGERY THAT'S PERFORMED IS NOT. EXCUSE MY BLUNT TERMINOLOGY REMOVING A* THAT'S TO SIMPLY NOT DONE. SURGERY THAT WERE PERFORMING NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME IS A GIRL. WITH CHROMOSOMES THAT ARE A GIRL WITH OVARIES WITH FUTURE FERTILITY POTENTIAL WHO HAS A NORMAL* THAT'S SIMPLY NOT OUT AT THE SKIN SOURCE COLOR YOUR GENERAL SINUS REPAIR. ANY EFFORT. WITH THE RESOLUTION. WHICH. IS A RESOLUTION. WELL INFLUENCE INSURANCE COMPANIES ABOUT COVERAGE. WHICH HAS A DIRECT IMPLICATION ON ACCESS TO OUR PATIENTS FOR ALL FORMS OF MEDICAL CARE. SO WHAT YOU SAID IT WAS THAT A CONVERSATION HAPPEN I'M A MONTH WHERE MEDICAL EXPERTS NO NO NO CONVERSATION HASN'T HAPPENED AMONG. MYSELF. AND THE PEOPLE HERE AND ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAINST THIS RESOLUTION AND STATE SENATOR LEADERS OFFICE IN SPITE OF ME AGGRESSIVELY SOME SIDE IN HIS DISTRICT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ON WHAT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY. RIGHT AND SO WRITER RECYCLED BACK TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS A RESOLUTION IS A STATEMENT. MONTH AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I SEE THE ADVANCE I VERY MUCH VALUE YOUR EX. IT'S YOU HAVE AN EXPERTISE THAT FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T. BUT A SEE ALSO WHAT HAPPENS WITH RESOLUTIONS AND HOW RESOLUTIONS ARE USED AND I AND I FEEL THAT. WHAT'S BEING BROUGHT FORWARD TO US TODAY IS IN A PER AN AFFIRMATION. I'M AN AFFIRMATION OF. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE I AM ABLE TO AFFIRM THEIR OWN AT A GENDER I THINK THAT THIS WILL. MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT WILL CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS YOU WILL ALL BE PART OF THOSE CRIMES STATIONS ON AND AT THIS TIME AS A RESOLUTION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. AND IT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO IT I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT IS NEW TO US. IN CALIFORNIA AS A MATTER OF FACT AND THERE'S BEEN A STRONG MOVEMENT AND FOR DECADES AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD I UNDERSTAND. THAT AS SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE ON BEFORE IT CAN RAISE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON A CAN RAISE A LOT OF THE. ISSUES FOR S. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHY YOU ARE HEARING YOU ARE RAISING THOSE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. BUT AT AGAIN AS A STATEMENT. OF SOMEWHAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO AFFIRM THEIR GENDER AND FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL SUPPORT THAT THE BILL. AND. I THAT I'M OF THE BILL. THIS THE BILL THE RESOLUTION. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TO RAISE. BUT SENATOR WIENER DONE BUT YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR YOU IN FACT SO AS I. THOSE PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND THAT AFTER HEARING NEUROLOGISTS TIME. I'M NOT SURE ANY LONGER I'M FASCINATED ACTUALLY BY THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE. THE IT'S GOT ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS AB RELIGIOUS IMPLICATIONS PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS I MEAN IT IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY COMPLEX. A QUESTION AND I FEEL LIKE I AM. NOT ABLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS DECISION I GUESS THE ONE QUESTION IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A RESOLUTION. VERSES A PIECE OF OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BE BUT THAT HAVE A FOR FORCE AND EFFECT OF LAW WHITE Y. RESOLUTION AND NOTS. AND NOT MOVE DOWN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ROUTE LACKEY SURE ON. AND FIRST OF ALL. WELL. THERE HAS BEEN LEGISLATION OTHER STATES IN THE BOTTOM THAT I SEE PASSED OUT OF ONE OF THE. LEGISLATION TO BAN. THAT THE SURGERY. MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY THE PAST ONE OF THE HOUSES AND THEN A FAILED IN THE SECOND HOUSE. IN TEXAS IT WAS INTRODUCED SO IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED TO AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE. IS ORGANIZING AROUND THAT BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEY WANNA. PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO. WE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL TO DO RESOLUTION. RAISE THE ISSUE. START A DIALOGUE. ABOUT IT. EDUCATE. AND ANNOUNCED THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING A RESOLUTION AND THAT I THINK IT HAS BEEN HELPFUL. I WANTED TO SAY. TERMS MEDICAL PROFESSION. I COULD'VE GOTTEN A BUNCH OF DOCTORS AND THAT STUDENTS TO COME HERE TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WHICH WAS INITIALLY OPPOSED HAS REMOVED ITS OPPOSITION WE. WE DID IT IS NOT ACCURATE TO SAY THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN SPEAKING TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WE'VE. ENGAGED EXTENSIVELY AND CMI HAS REMOVED ITS OPPOSITION AND AS A RESULT OF SOME AMENDMENTS. THAT WE TALK ABOUT THEIR LOCAL MEDICAL SOCIETIES THAT AND AT THE OUTSET WANTED TO. DORIS THE BILL. BUT THEY WANT ONE CM A TEMPORARILY CAME ON OPPOSITION THEY FELT THEY WERE PRECLUDED FROM. FROM DOING THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY A ROBUST DEBATE OCCURRING WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN TIME AND REALIZE THAT SOME OF THE WAYS WE'VE DONE THINGS IN THE PAST. ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THAT. AYE AND YOU'RE ALWAYS THIS ARE DEFINITELY VERY OPPOSED. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT OUT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY REFLUX THE ENTIRE MEDICAL. PROFESSION AND I WANT TO JUST REALLY STRESS. WHEN THE. WHEN THE DOCTOR TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS NOT A SNOB JUDGMENT IT'S NOT BROTHERS WHISKEY. BABIES FROM THE BIRTHING ROOM TO DO THE SURGERY. AND THERE'S ALL THESE PEOPLE INVOLVED THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION. BECAUSE ONE PERSON THAT WAS LEFT OUT OF THAT DECISION. A PERSON WHOSE LIFE WILL BE PERMANENTLY IRREVERSIBLY IMPACTED. BY ABOUT SURGERY. THAT BECAUSE A PERSON IS A BABY OR AN INFANT AND IS A LEASE FOR AWHILE MIGHT ABLE TO EXPRESS. THEIR GENDER TAKES TIME THE CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND SO ALL OVER ASKING IS FOR. TO GIVE THAT SPACE SO THAT THAT CHILD CAN MAKE A DECISION FOR THEMSELVES. I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ONCE THEY TURN EIGHTEEN. WE KNOW THEIR CHILDREN NOW HAVE THESE FIVE SIX A TECH WHO WERE VERY STRONGLY AFFIRMING THEIR GENDER. AND THEN THEIR PARENTS ARE BEING RESPECTFUL AND WORKING WITH THEM AND GIVING THEM THE MEDICAL CARE. THEY NEED OR DON'T AND NOT GIVING THE MEDICAL CARE THEY DON'T NEED US THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS. AND IF I CAN. MISTER CHAIR OF. FROM THE. FACT THAT CMA IS NOT OPPOSE THIS ANY LONGER ABOUT THE UROLOGIST AND I APOLOGIZE OF A BEEN HERE FOR FOUR YEARS THE LEGISLATURE. AND. THERE WAS A TERM I LEARNED WHILE IN COLLEGE RENT SEE. AND SO WE HAVE LOTS OF GROUPS THAT COME IN ARE POSTED THINGS ON BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE THEY SUPPORTER OPPOSE THINGS BASED UPON THAT. AND SO I GUESS THE IN LISTENED YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS. WHY HAS IT WHAT WHY IS THIS A QUESTION THAT YOU AS AN ORGANIZATION HAVE IT FIGURED OUT AND MAYBE EVEN PROPOSED? SOME. SOME SOME GUIDELINES AT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU GUYS TO BE ABLE TO. TO SUPPORT OF. A RESOLUTION OR EVEN SOME LEGISLATION A TO THIS. IF YOU ARE. THESE ARE NOT GENDER REAFFIRMING SURGERIES ARE TRYING TO MAKE THAT POINT. THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO HAVE CONGENITAL ANOMALIES LIKE A CLEFT PALATE. MY WOMAN INTEREST STILL. A CARDIAC DEFECT THAT'S FIXED. RESTORING NORMAL ANATOMY. THIS IS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. LET ME ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT OUR POSITION AND CONSENSUS. SENATOR WIENER UNFORTUNATELY MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN BAD INFORMATION BUT MIS CHARACTERIZED WHAT THE LEVEL OF CONSENSUS IS AND ALSO. WHAT THE DIALOGUE AT THAT LEVEL THE CMA HAS BEEN? IN FACT. THIS YEAR MAY OPPOSED THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE CMA THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR IN LANGUAGE. AS OPPOSED TO ITS POSITION ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL IT'S PENDING AGREEMENT ON AMENDMENTS THAT. ARE STILL. IN PROCESS. SO TO MISS CHARACTERIZATION TO THINK OF THE CMA IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION FURTHERMORE WE DID CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS. FROM PEDIATRICS TO ENDOCRINOLOGIST PSYCHOLOGISTS PSYCHIATRISTS. AND. PEDIATRIC SURGEONS AS WELL AS. ACTIVIST KENNY GENERAL. THOUGH. WHY DON'T WE HAVE ANY BUT WAS THERE ANY OPPOSITION? FROM THOSE FROM THOSE GROUPS ONLY OPPOSITION I SEE IS FROM. THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CLINICAL UROLOGISTS IN THE AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION HOW COME THOSE OTHERS. HAVEN'T MY HAVE BEEN DEPOSED. ARE WE ACTUALLY HAVE PROVIDED A CONSENSUS STATEMENT. BUT IT MAY THAT IT'S NOT AND NOT PACKET THIS IS A PACKET I PUT TOGETHER AS AN ADDENDUM. BUT THE CONSENSUS OF THESE NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS ON CONFERENCE CALLS THAT INCLUDED INTERACT MEDICALSTUDENT ASSOCIATION IN THE GAY AND LESBIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS ALL STAKEHOLDERS WE NEWARK. INVOLVED. ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS EXCEPT FOR INTERACT MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION AND BEGAN MEDICAL AS WE DISSOCIATION CAME WITH A CONSENSUS. THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE A MORATORIUM ON SURGERY FOR INFANTS AND CHILDREN BECAUSE ARE INDEED PER CASES WHERE THERE WAS GOOD PROVIDED. AND THAT WAS IN FACT THE CONSENSUS AND TO HAVE GUIDELINES IN A SITUATION THAT REQUIRES SUCH A MULTI DISCIPLINARY INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH. EVEN IS PROBLEMATIC BUT WHAT WE DO DO IS TAKE A VERY CAREFUL MULTI DISCIPLINARY APPROACH AND WE MOVE WITH GREAT CARE. MISTER JORDAN FIVE I I WANT TO JUST CRIED I'D MADE US LIKE A STATEMENT PROBLEMS CLIMATE CMA OF WERE WORKING WITH THEM ON THE MEN WERE RIGHT AT THE AND THEY TOLD US THAT THEY. WILL REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION ONCE WE. FINALIZE OUT AND PUT IT ACROSS OTHER DID NOT SUBMIT OPPOSE LATER THIS COMMITTEES ARE NOT HERE I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THEY'RE NOT YEAH I'M ONLY GONNA BUT THEY'VE INDICATED. THAT WILL. THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION. CARILLO. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER FOR BRINGING THIS TO THIS RESOLUTION TO OUR ATTENTION. JUST TIME. IN HEARING THE TESTIMONY. THERE'S BEEN WORDS LIKE NORMAL BEING USED. AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC. THIS IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND WHAT WE CAN'T WHAT WE HAVE CONSIDERED NORMAL IN THE PAST. IN TERMS OF. WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED TODAY IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE THAT WE USE TO ADDRESS. THE COMMUNITY THAT IS IN OUR SEX OR THE LGBT COMMUNITY WHICH HAS. CONTINUOUSLY FOUGHT FOR THEIR VERY MERRICK'S THIS. AND SO THIS AT THE END OF THE DAY. IS A CELEBRATION OF PEOPLE IT'S A RESOLUTION TO CELEBRATE PEOPLE THAT ARE INTERSEX. AND THAT YOU SHOULD BE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY YOU WANT TO LIVE YOUR LIFE AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE ALREADY NORMAL TO. THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT. SOMEONE ELSE CAN TELL YOU ABOUT WHO YOU ARE. AND IT'S CHALLENGING TWO PERCENT AND SHARE YOUR STORY PEOPLE THAT MAY NOT BE AS FAMILIAR. WITH THE ISSUE SO I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION AND I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS CAN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A. WHOLE OTHER WORLD IN CONVERSATION ABOUT GENDER AND SEXUALITY THAT IT'S MUCH MORE FLUID. THEN THE NORMAL CONVERSATION THAT THAT HAS BEEN HAD IN THE PAST THANK YOU. THE GIVES MR THIS AREA MY APOLOGIES I SKIPPED ADDED ME TO DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T. THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR. DERECHOS EVENTUALLY GONNA GET. EVERYONE. SENATOR I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD BECAUSE I'VE STRUGGLED WITH IT AND AND USUALLY YOUR BILLS AND THIS COMMITTEE I'M. I'M ON BOARD. THIS IS A RESOLUTION SALT SUPPORTED TODAY BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO. TAKE SUCH AN ISSUE LIKE THIS INTO HAND. WHEN THERE'S VERY LITTLE DATA AVAILABLE. AND I'VE CONTACT WE'VE. I THINK AT THE STAFF LEVEL CUT COMMUNICATED AND ASK FOR THE DATA. I TRY TO LOOK FOR IT IN OTHER PLACES JUST NOW. FOR THE FIRST TIME I HEARD FROM NOT MISTAKEN NINE PERCENT OF SURGERIES FEW ONE ELABORATE ON THAT IT BE INTERESTED BUT BEFORE YOU DO. AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE WAS. IF IF IF THIS HAD. IF THIS BILL HAD BEEN ADVANCED IN NEVADA WHAT. DATA WAS USED THEIR TO ADVANCE THE ISSUE. I AND I. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD? GIVEN THE SENSITIVITIES OF THE ISSUE THERE MAY BE PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH. THE CARE AND THOUGHTFULNESS AND. MAYBE THE UNIFORMITY THAT IT NEEDS SO. THERE NEEDS TO BE GREATER AWARENESS THROUGH THIS MEASURE I UNDERSTAND THAT AND APPRECIATE THAT HARD VERY MUCH BUT. WHEN YOU GET INTO THE SCIENCE PORTION OF IT I'M JUST WONDERING. THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DATA TO BE. REALLY UPHOLDING THIS SO IF THIS WAS A BILL I'D BE STRUGGLING I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. SO IF THERE IS SOME DATA THAT YOU CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON AND OFF FOR A I'D. LIKE TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES. CAN I SPEAK TO THAT. YOU KNOW OH WHEREIN I BOTH SPOKE TO THE CENSUS GO A HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE BACK IN. AS THE NINETIES EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. AND WE BOTH ARE SAYING THE SAME THING AT THAT POINT. BUT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS NOW IT WAS TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THERE STILL IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE SURGERIES ACTUALLY. HAVE ANY GOOD OUTCOMES AND THERE'S PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE VERY BAD OUTCOMES AND CATASTROPHIC OUTCOMES. REFER YOU TO THE LETTER THAT WAS SENT TO ALL OF YOU FROM A DOCTOR EILEEN WONKY SUMMARIZES A LOT OF. LARRY'S POINTS ABOUT. WHAT SURGERIES HE'S DOING AND WHAT THE PERCENTAGES ARE? I ALSO LIKE TO MENTION TO YOU THAT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DOES FUNNY SURGERIES TO BE AGAINST WHAT THEY CONSIDER PERSONAL AUTONOMY. AND THEIR DANCING SURGERIES AS WELL. THINKING. SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. ALTHOUGH THIS IS JUST A RESOLUTION THE WHEREAS IS THAT IT IS BASED UPON GROSSLY MISREPRESENT THE SCIENCE AND THE FACTS. SO EVEN THOUGH THE INTENTIONS ARE GOOD. TO COME OUT OF THE GATE. WITH A FOUNDATION FOR POSSIBLE LEGISLATION THE FUTURE BASED ON SO MANY GROSS MISREPRESENTATIONS AND. INCORRECT STATEMENTS I THINK WOULD BE HARMFUL TO. WHAT COULD OTHERWISE BE A VERY UPLIFTING AND AND HELPFUL CONVERSATION IN THE FUTURE? OF THE PATIENTS TO UNDERGO SURGERY NINETY PERCENT OF THEM ARE CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA PATIENTS WHICH ARE GIRLS WHOSE GENDER IDENTITY IS FEMALE. BUT HIS GENITALS ARE OVER STIMULATED BY TESTOSTERONE AND LOOK LIKE MALE GENITALS. THESE GIRLS ARE NOT FORCED TO. IDENTIFIES GROWTH BY THE COMMUNITY OR THEIR SOCIETY THIS IS THEIR BRAIN SEX THIS IS THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. AND IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE THAT AFFIRMING SURGERY WE'VE BECOME MUCH MORE ENLIGHTENED IN ALLOWING PEOPLE WITH GENDER DYSPHORIA TO HAVE GENDER AFFIRMING SURGERY AT YOUNGER AND YOUNGER AGES. WE'RE NOW MOVING PAST ADULTHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE AND EVEN PRE ADOLESCENTS ALLOWING. THESE PEOPLE TO TRANSITION WITH HORMONAL THERAPY AND THEN EVENTUALLY SURGERY WHY WOULD WE DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE WITH THIS POPULATION OF GIRLS AND PREVENT THEM FROM AFFIRMING THEIR CHATTER. UNTIL THEY'RE AT OLDER AGES BECAUSE WHO KNOWS WHAT THE AGE. THE LOWER LIMIT AT THE AGE OF OUR ABILITY WILL BE AND WHO KNOWS WHEN ONE'S IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR GENITALIA STARTS TO. RATIFY WITH THEIR SELF IDENTIFICATION IN THE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH THEY PERCEIVE THE WORLD AROUND THEM. WHEN IS THE APPROPRIATE AGE TO FINALLY ALLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR IDENTITY AND AGAIN IT'S NINETY PERCENT OF THE PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO SURGERY OR CAN THIS CATEGORIZATION. I'D I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGH POP BETTER THE SCIENTIFIC MEDICAL. DATABASE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STUDIES WERE WOMEN WHO HAVE CONGENITAL HYPERPLASIA. A FORM OF DST WHICH THEY DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE. YEAH BECAUSE THEY REFERRED US TO BE CALL NORMAL PEOPLE WHICH THEY ARE. ARE HAPPY WITH THEIR OUTCOMES WHEN THEY HAD SURGERY OF CHILDHOOD AND MORE AND WHEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE SURGERY. IF THEY. WEREN'T GIVEN THE SURGERY THEY DEFINITELY HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE THE SURGERY AS BABIES. SO OF THE OUTCOMES THERE THE LETTER SHE WAS THERE. IN THIS GROUP OF PATIENTS WE HAVE EXCELLENT LONG TERM DATA IN SOME OF THE OTHER REFER PATIENTS. WE DON'T WERE GATHERING BUT THIS IS THE. PATIENT GROUP THAT WE SEE MOST OFTEN. SHERIFF YOU KNOW I JUST HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY A. I'M MISSING SOMETHING SO IT SAYS BETWEEN. ONE TO TWO PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS ARE BORN WITH VARIATIONS IN THEIR PHYSICAL. SEX CHARACTERISTICS. OF THE ONE TO TWO PERCENT WHAT PERCENTAGE AND GOING THROUGH SURGERY. AND. LEAVE MY ESTIMATE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE RESOLUTION AS IT SPITS WAY LESS THAN ONE PERCENT ARE BORN WITH A TYPICAL GENITALIA. SO I THINK THAT'S A MISREPRESENTATION OF THE ACTUAL FACTS. THE NUMBER OF SURGERIES ARE DONE IN THIS COUNTRY. IN MY OPINION THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY CONTROVERSIAL OR LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED. IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY. SPUR. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU AND I DON'T I'M. IS YOUR INTENT TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR INFANTS WHO ARE GENETICALLY FEMALE. WHO ARE JUST HAVING A EUROPE UROLOGICAL ISSUE FOR THEM TO GET CORRECTIVE SURGERY IS THAT YOUR AND TEN OR NINE? BOB. HER PARENTS HAD IS NOT TO. FOR ONCE SURGERY IS MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY. TO. TO TO THE FOR SO. ALWAYS GONNA BE A SPECTRUM RAIN AND I DON'T THINK IT'S SECURE SOLVING ANYONE. IT'S GOING TO SAY THAT IF YOU HAVE. IT FOR IF WE LOOK AT ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM A MINOR. YOU KNOW ISSUE THAT NO LONGER SURGERY GUY AND WHEN WE GET THE COMPARISON THE CLEFT PALATE WHICH. YOU KNOW IT'S AN ALTAR SORT IT OUT GENDER AND AND THERE ARE SOME PROCEDURES THAT IMPACT. THE ASSIGNMENT. AGENDA PHYSICAL ASSIGNMENT OF GENDER AND SOME THAT DON'T AND YOU GET IF THERE WERE EFFORT ON THIS AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT WHAT WE HAVE NINE. GOTTEN THERE. THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT THIS GOES YES AND PUT BECAUSE THIS IS A MORE GENERAL RESOLUTION. TO PUT US ON THE RECORD SO TO BE SUPER CLEAR I COMPLETELY SUPPORT YOU I I DO NOT THINK IT ANY TIME THIS IS A RESOLUTION IS A RESOLUTION WITHIN A. CONVERSATION THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I KNOW THIS SENATOR I DO NOT BELIEVE FOR ONE MINUTE I MEAN I HAVE A YOUNG DAUGHTER I DO NOT BELIEVE FOR ONE MINUTE THAT HE WOULD EVER WANT. USE OF SOME SORT OF SIMPLE SURGERY TO HELP WITH YOUR OLOGY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO EVER BE. GIVEN TO EACH CHILD I THINK WHAT I THINK I THINK YOU ARE VERY CLEAR ON YOUR INTENT HERE I THINK THE OPPOSITION IS GOING A LITTLE TOO FAR IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE SAYING THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING. THAT I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE CLAIMING COMPLETE SUPPORT. PEOPLE NEED TIME TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND YES. AS AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID WE SHOULD LOVE PEOPLE FOR WHO THEY ARE AND AS WELL EVERYBODY WANTS AND S. WORLD. SO. I DON'T THINK THAT I THINK WE'RE COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES HERE AND WITHOUT I JUST WOULD. I JUST I AM I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND IF IT IS EVER A BILL I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU WILL DEAL WITH THE SPACE SOME OF THE ISSUES AND THE GRAY AREAS THAT NEED. ANYONE ELSE. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER. BUT LET'S CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THIS WAS SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD FOR THE CONVERSATION I THINK. HIS.
