ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING ON FILE ITEM. AB YEAH FILE ITEM ONE AB ONE SIXTY ONE THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER FIRST ON THE THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS. BILL -- WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- AS AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE -- WITH PAPER RECEIPTS. THE GENERATE. THEY HAVE A GARDEN. CREATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WASTE. WE AT THIS WE KNOW THAT THREE MILLION TREES NINE BILLION GALLONS OF WATER -- ACTUALLY ARE USED TO GENERATE PEOPLE PAPER RECEIPTS GENERATES ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION POUNDS OF WASTE FOUR MILLION POUNDS OF CARBON DIOXIDE. ARE AB ONE SIXTY ONE WE BELIEVE IS A VERY SOUND SOLUTION ON HOW TO REDUCE. THE WASTE WITHIN PAPER RECEIPTS ON IN ADDITION WE LEAVE CONSUMERS THE OPTION TO ALWAYS REQUEST A PAPER RECEIPT TO HAVE THAT ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO THEM SHOULD THEY ACTUALLY WANT A PAPER RECEIPT AND SHOULD THEY ACTUALLY. REQUESTED WE AGAIN AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. TO REMOVE THE DIGITAL RECEIPT MANDATED BEEN ALSO -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HELP RESOLVE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS THAT -- MANY PEOPLE HAD SHARED IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEES -- WE ALSO -- WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT ONE AMENDMENTS WAS STARTING IN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO REQUIRES EVER SEATS BE REPAIRABLE UPON REQUEST AND FOR THOSE RECEIPTS TO BE. AYE BPA IN B. PS FREE. AS YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE THERE'S A STUDY OUT THERE THAT ABOUT 93% OF BESI PAPERS ARE COATED WITH PPA OR BE PS WHICH IS A VERY WELL DOCUMENTED TOXIC SUBSTANCE SO. I EVEN IF PEOPLE WANT PAPER SEES WE THINK IT'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR US TO GIVE THEM. A PROCEEDS THAT REALLY ARE NOT TOXIC ON IN WITHOUT LET ME JUST TURN OVER TO MY TWO WITNESSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FIRST WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE ACTION A CORPUS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THIS BILL SIR TARGETS AS SOME OF THE LOWEST HANGING FRUIT AND WE SAW THIS LAST YEAR WITH THE STRUGGLE -- THERE ARE CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS THAT WE ARE HANDED. THAT WE LITERALLY CARRIED TO THE NEXT TRASH CAN AND THROW AWAY. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PRODUCTS -- IF WE CAN'T AT THE VERY LEAST ALLOW PEOPLE TO NOT TAKE SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT. AND THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GONNA CHIEF ARE MORE IMPRESSIVE AN AMBITIOUS. GOALS AT FIRST SEATS SPECIFICALLY THEY ARE OFTEN -- A CONTAMINANT IN THE RECYCLING STREAM -- THAT B. P. SMB PA AND UP IN THE RECYCLED MATERIALS AS WELL. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF LOGICAL REASONS TO DO THIS BUT BASIC COMES DOWN TO LET'S AT LEAST LET WANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS SHORT AND SWEET NEXT WITNESS PLEASE BILL ALLEY -- FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP WE SUPPORTED THIS BILL SINCE ITS INCEPTION FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH REASONS -- WHICH IS EXPOSURE TO BYZANTINE ALL I AM VISITING ALL OF BOTH ARE UNKNOWN TOXICANTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE BAD FOR ESPECIALLY FOR OF PREGNANT WOMEN A LOT OF CASHIERS SOMETIMES ARE PREGNANT AND THEIR EXPOSURE IS HIGH WHEN THEY'RE WORKING WITH THESE RECEIPTS. ON A DAILY BASIS AND MOST OF MARK COMPLETELY UNAWARE. OF THEIR EXPOSURE SO AB ONE SIXTY ONE WILL HELP ELIMINATE THIS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHICH SHOULD BE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON TREE SEBERG **** ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. STEPHANIE MOORE ON BEHALF OF ONCOLOGY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AS AMENDED YES THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN I THINK THEY'RE NOTED -- AND YOU MAY HAVE MISSED IT BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING IF YOU'LL ADDRESS SAID AGAIN IN YOUR CLOTHES THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MARGARET GLAD SEEN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WE DO CONTINUE TO STILL OPPOSE THE BILL WE THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR SEVERAL REASONS THE NO RECEIPT IS VERY MUCH A PROBLEM FOR MANY OF OUR MEMBERS. RECEIPTS ARE IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP US PREVENT -- THEFT AND THEY'RE IMPORTANT LOSS PREVENTION TOOL OUR A SALES ASSOCIATE SOMETIMES ASK PEOPLE TO SEE THEM T THE DOOR OR AS A ROLE AS THEY HAVE LEFT THE STORE. SO IT IS IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THAT -- AS YOU RECALL THE VOTERS PASSED PROP ONE PROP PASSED PROP -- FORTY SEVEN THAT'S IT'S A NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR SAFT LIMIT IN EVERYTHING BELOW THAT IS A MISDEMEANOR WE NOW SEE CRIMINALS COMING IN THE STORE WITH CALCULATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY BELOW THAT LEVEL. AND SO THIS IS TAKING AWAY ONE MORE TOOL FOR US IN LOSS PREVENTION. OUT ALSO NOTE THAT MANY STORES HAVE A RECEIPT REQUIREMENT FOR RETURNS AND SO IF A CUSTOMER DECIDES THEY DON'T WANT TO RECEIVE AT THE POINT OF SALE AND THEN WANTS TO BRING SOMETHING BACK -- THEY'LL BE FRUSTRATED WITH THE RETAILER BECAUSE THEY CHOSE NOT TO GET A RECEIPT ALSO IT IS EASY -- FOR CONSUMERS WHO WANT TO HAVE STOLEN SOMETHING WANT TO BRING BACK A RECEIPT TO DUMMY UP A RECEIPT -- AND COMMIT RECEIPT FRAUD IT SOMETHING WE FIGHT EVERY DAY THE OTHER THING THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IS THE LIMITATION ON WHAT WE CAN PRINT ON THESE. A RECEIPT FOR NON ESSENTIAL ITEMS -- YOU'RE INCREASING THE COST WITH THE MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS IN THIS YEAR ALSO RESTRICTING OUR ABILITIES HELP PEOPLE ON TO GO SOMETIMES ON RECEIPTS WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO VOTE RIGHT BEFORE ELECTION DAY WE COURAGE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CENSUS. WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO MAKE CHARITABLE DONATIONS AS WELL AS OFFERING COUPONS AND ADVERTISEMENTS ENCOURAGING GO TO OUR WEBSITE SO ALL OF THESE THINGS WOULD BE POTENTIALLY CONSIDERED NONESSENTIAL ITEMS THAT MAY NOT FIT ON THE RECEIPT AND WE HAVE CONCERNS. FOR THOSE REASONS WE KNOW THERE BEEN ISSUES ABOUT COUPONS BUT THOSE COUPONS OF HELP SAVE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR JUST FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF RETAILERS ALONE. THESE CONCERNS ALL MAKE IT HARDER FOR BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS TO OPERATE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THIS LEGISLATURE'S ASKING US TO ALREADY COLLECT POINT OF SALE FEES. BE THE POINT OF CONTACT OR THAT THE TAKE BACK RECEPTACLE FOR MANY DIFFERENT ITEMS YOU WANT US TO AN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'RE COMPETING AGAINST. ONLINE SALES THIS MAKES IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR BURKE IN ORDER TO OPERATE OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT WITNESS A WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO MADAM SECRETARY LET'S ESTABLISH THE QUARTER. JACKSON HERE JACKSON HERE BORDERS. FOR JUST HERE TO RUSSELL. RUSSELL HERE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ HERE JONES. JONES HERE MONNING [inaudible] STERN [inaudible] I'M BURKE. WHAT CASKEY WHAT HEALTHCARE? ALL RIGHT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE'LL GO ON TO THE NEXT. TO WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND MATT CERTAIN OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE TOO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS WELL -- WE ARE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DIFFERENT EATING ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE MOST OF WHICH WOULD BE YOUR SMALL INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY BASED RESTAURANTS. THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS BILL WILL IMPACT US AND I WANT TO TOUCH ON THREE DIFFERENT ISSUES THE EXEMPTIONS THE PRODUCT LIMITATION MEANING THE PAPER -- AND THEN THE CONTENT RESTRICTIONS ON OUR COMMUNICATION WITH OUR GUESTS. FIRST OF ALL -- WITH REGARD TO THIS SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTIONS I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU. THAT THESE ARE STRUCTURED IN A WAY -- THAT ARE BASED ON GROSS RECEIPTS AND GROSS RECEIPTS DO NOT ALWAYS TELL YOU WHETHER A RESTAURANT IS LARGE OR SMALL -- WERE RETAIL FOR THAT MATTER GROSS RECEIPTS IS A NUMBER THAT'S THAT'S DRIVEN BY FOOT TRAFFIC IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE SEE. IN A GIVEN ESTABLISHMENT EACH DAY -- AND DEPENDING ON YOUR GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENTIALS ON COSTS IN GEOGRAPHY AND PRICES AND REAL ESTATE YOUR GROSS RECEIPTS WILL VERY DRAMATICALLY AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE THE POINTS YOU THE GROSS RECEIPTS DON'T DICTATE WHETHER YOUR A BIG OR SMALL FOOT PRINT. OR WHETHER YOU EMPLOY A LOT OF PEOPLE OR A FEW PEOPLE SO WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS AN ADEQUATE -- EXEMPTION AND WE DO THINK THAT THIS WILL APPLY TO MANY SMALL RETAILERS AND SMALL RESTAURANTS IN PARTICULAR. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE PAPER THE LIMITATION ON THE PRODUCT THE PAPER HAS TO BE BPA OR BE PS FREE. THAT IS SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS HERE AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT THAT IS LIMITING THE NUMBER OF THE SUPPLY OF RECEIPT PAPER THAT WE CAN USE. WHICH IS THE END USERS OF THE RECEIPT PAPER SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPPLIERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THAT AMOUNTS OF BPA AND BE PS FREE PAPER -- AND I KNOW THE BILL WOULD IN THIS SITUATIONWOULD TAKE EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHAT WE DID SEE WITH THE STRAW BAN. WAS THAT WE DID SEE A HUGE RUN ON STRAW PURCHASES OF COURSE -- BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR SUPPLIERS TO MEET THE DEMAND OF ALL THE NEWS DROP PURCHASES WE FEAR THAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITH THE BPA AND BE PS FREE PAPER. AND SO WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE IS LIMITING THE CONTENT ON RECEIPTS WE USE RECEIPTS AS A WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR GUESTS ALL THE TME WE DO IT TO CELEBRATE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR WORKFORCE WE DO IT TO ADVERTISE CHARITY PROGRAMS AND ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU WE DO IT FOR SURVEYS IF I MAY JUST RANK YOU WOULD GET FOR TEN MINUTES ELEVEN SECONDS THIS IS GOING TO SET A BAD TREND. SO IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS WILL CERTAINLY INVITE THEM. OUR OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU PLEASE COME FOR WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. pOF AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL WERE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA FEELS INCONVENIENCE ALLIANCE REPRESENTING OVER -- TWELVE THOUSAND GAS STATIONS A CONVENIENCE STORES IN THE STATE WE WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE RESTAURANTS THE STATION ON THE SMALL BUSINESS IMPACT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR TOM SHE HE REPRESENTING THE LANDSCAPE CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL KESSLER BECAUSE OUR ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION ON ALL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. SEVEN ANDRSON ON BEHALF OF FAMILY WINE MAKERS OF CALIFORNIA AND WESTERN CAR WASH ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AFTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM RILEY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS THE SENATOR ALSO DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES -- I I DO HAVE BY MYSELF UNUSUAL UNUSUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT A NUMBER OF OF THINGS -- I DO THINK THAT THERE WHAT I'VE HEARD THAT THERE IS -- A VALID CONCERN ABOUT LOSS PREVENTION -- AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE SOLUTION IS BUT I DO SEE HOW THAT IS -- A VERY VALID CONCERN I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH RECEIPT FRAUD SO I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG IT IS BUT THAT JUST CAUGHT MY ATTENTION -- WITH REGARDS TO THE RECEIPTS -- AS THEIR BEEN CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VOLUNTARY -- USE OF RECEIPTS LIKE THE CUSTOMER IS THAT INCLUDED IN YOUR AND I DIDN'T TWO IS SET TO THE AUTHOR YES YEAH SO THEY ARE ON WE WE HAVE HAD -- CONVERSES WITH RETAILERS ABOUT DIFFERENT OPTIONS -- THERE THAT'S WHY WE PUT THE BILL WHERE IT'S RECEIPT UPON DEMAND YOU CAN EITHER ASK FOR NO RECEIVED AS FOR PAPER RECEIPT. IT REALLY GIVES YOU THOSE OPTIONS AND THEN WHAT WE FOCUSED ON IN TERMS OF THE PAPER. IT IS REALLY WHAT THE USE OF THE PAPER WAS THOSE OF THE AMENDMENTS WE TOOK OUT OF ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS. TO REALLY LIMIT THE RECEIPT TO THE RECEIPT NOT TERM MARKETING MATERIAL IN FACT I THOUGHT THE SENATE. ANALYSIS POINTED OUT -- QUITE QUITE WELL AN ARTICLE THAT SAID -- THE A PARTICULAR BE TO I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO THE PARTICULAR RETAILER BUT THEIR RECEIPT WAS OVER THREE FEET LONGER THAN IT EITHER NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S TYPICAL RISKY. AND THEY'RE FAIRLY FAMOUS FOR THEIR VERY LONG RECEIPTS AND THIS IS EXCLUDING THE RECEIPT AND THE COUPONS [inaudible] HA. I'M AND THE ISSUE OF THE PAPER AND THE IS THE PAPER AND THE INK. THE THE PAPER IT IS A TOXIC. THE IT IS IT'S ACTUALLY PAPER ITSELF THE PAPERS OFFICE COATED WITH -- BPA SLASH PPS -- THAT IS THE PART THAT'S TOXIC BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THAT CHEMICAL SO THAT THE INQUIRIES SHOULD ON THE PAPER CAPTION. UHHUH. AND WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES TO THAT THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE OR WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THAT. WELL THAT'S WHAT WE ALSO WAITED TO BEGIN THE BILL'S NOT GOING INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THERE'S TIME. TO TRANSITION -- AGAIN BUT THE STUDY SAYS THAT 93% OF THE RECEIPTS ARE USING THIS KIND OF PAPER SO THAT MEANS 7% AREN'T AND SO THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES OUT THERE. BUT THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S TO MY NEXT QUESTION IS. THE WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO MAKE. THE PAPER NOT [inaudible] TOXIC. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE INVESTMENT THAT READILY AVAILABLE IS THAT A BIG PROBLEM WHAT. WHAT IS THE? WHAT ARE THE ISSUES AS FAR AS? USING THEM AND NEEDING THEM AND WANTING THE RECEIPTS HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM OF THE PAPER SAYS TO THE PAPER THAT WE USE TODAY THE PAPER THAT YOU'RE USING TURN TO RETURN MATERIALS IS. NOT LAYS WITH PPA PPS FOR THE PAPER ITSELF IS. READILY AVAILABLE -- IN TERMS OF HOW IT INTERFACES WITH THE DIFFERENT RETAIL MACHINES I THINK THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY BETTER IN A BETTER QUESTION TO ASK THE DIFFERENT RETAILERS -- I DID ONE OF THOSE SINCE IT SHOULD MENTION ALSO LOSS PREVENTION -- I THINK THAT -- GET SOMETHING THAT WE HAD TALKED TO THE RETAILERS ABOUT THAT IS A CONCERN. HAVING SAID THAT MOST RETAILERS DON'T CHECK YOUR RECEIPT UPON EXITING THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE THAT ARE FAIRLY WELL KNOWN COSCO BEST BUY FOR EXAMPLE -- MOST OF THE RETAILERS IF YOU'RE IN A SUPERMARKET I I SHOP AT WALGREENS OR THE CVS OR RITE AID AND I CAN'T RECALL THE LAST TIME I WAS STOPPED -- UPON EXITING PUMP PAYING AN ACCIDENT SO CAN I UNDERSTAND THE LOSS PREVENTION ISSUE THAT THERE DEFINITELY HAS BEEN A BROADER ISSUE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THE RECEIPTS ARE THE THE RECEIPT OR THE LACK OF RECEIPTS IS REALLY. THE ISSUE THE THE CHALLENGE WITH LOSS PREVENTIONS WE ACTUALLY HAVE. BEEN A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THAT ARE ORGANIZED IN ARE GOING INTO STORES AND STEALING THINGS I DON'T THINK. THEY'RE GONNA STOP BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE RECEIPTS OR DON'T HAVE. FOR SIX I THINK THERE'S A FEW MORE STORES ARE STARTING TO USE AT HOME DEPOT DOZEN SOME OF THE ONES BUT ANYWAY YEAH. I I DON'T LIST ALL OF THEM YEAH. COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF THE PAPER. CERTAINLY -- WE DO KNOW THAT THE B. P. A. B. P. S. FREE PAPER IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE -- NEED IT AB FOR OUR MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT LARGER AT RETAILERS -- IT CAN BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR EVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR -- SOME OF OUR POINT OF SALE SYSTEMS WILL NEED TO BE -- SIGNIFICANTLY REPROGRAMMED TO DEAL WITH THIS SOME OF THEM AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE RECEIPTS SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. AND IF I MAY I'D ALSO SAY THAT -- THE LOSS PREVENTION IS A PIECE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO US WE DON'T CHECK EVERY CUSTOMER IN EVERY ONE OF OUR STORES BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO US. IT IS ONE OF THE FEW TOOLS THAT WE HAVE TO HELP REDUCE THEFT IN OUR STORES I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT EUROPE DOES HAVE B. P. FREE SO THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE DONE -- AND IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE IN EUROPE SO I ASSUME THAT THEY WOULD. BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT WITHOUT SPENDING ENORMOUS COSTS THAT'S AN ISSUE ACTUALLY IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. IN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY THE OB. THE CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE LOSS PREVENTION -- IS ONE ARGUABLY -- THAT IS MORE WITHIN OUR PURVIEW ARE ISSUES ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THE FINES AND THE FACT THAT THEY DID THE TOOK THE AMENDMENTS -- WHICH REMOVE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS WE HAD AND FRANKLY THE PENALTY I ISSUES ARE WITHIN OUR PURVIEW BUT IT'S TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY WITH A MAXIMUM THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR SO THAT. CAN'T REALLY BE THE MAJOR. DETERMINANT OF THE OPPOSITION -- BUT PERHAPS AT SOME POINT WE CAN GET THAT RE FOCUSED ON THE LOSS PREVENTION. OF CENTER WHY KASKI THOUGH THE FLOOR IS YOURS MADAM CHAIR WE NORMALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BILLS ON COMMERCIAL SPEECH SO IT'S THAT'S A FUN THING MY QUESTION WAS ON THE STAFF REPORT. AT PAGE TWELVE IT'S REMOVING THE AMENDMENT ON THIS ON PURPOSE BEVERLY CREDIT ACT [inaudible] IT WAS. IS THAT JUST A PORTION OF IT OR IS IT THE WHOLE -- PERSONAL IDENTIFYING LANGUAGE THAT WAS IN THERE I JUST [inaudible] THEN. IT'S THOSE PROVISIONS ARE COMPLETELY OUT THE BECAUSE THIS IS A MOVEMENT AMENDMENT MIGHT THAT WAS OR SOME OTHER THING IT WAS A IT WAS A PORTION OF IT IN IN IN MY STATUS TELL ME HE WAS A PORTION THAT WE HAD ADDED THAT WE ARE TAKING OUT. THAT DEALS WITH YOUR PURSE LIKE THAT AFFECTS NO LONGER NEEDED BECAUSE THEY'RE NO LONGER MANDATING THE RECEIPTS PERFECT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] RIGHT -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS HERE I WOULD LIKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE TO ADDRESS. THE ISSUE OF LOSS PREVENTION YOU KNOW I THINK THE YOU CAN SEND AN EMAIL RECEIPT WE GET A LOT OF THOSE NOW -- BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE. I KNOW THEY'RE PROBABLY AT LEAST TEN PEOPLE IN THE STATE THAT DON'T HAVE AN IPHONE OR SOMETHING BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS COULD BE ARGUABLY AN ISSUE FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS. HOW DO YOU DRESS THAT RECEIPT IF YOU WANT TO RETURN AN ITEM? SO THAT YOU CAN IN FACT DO SO AND OTHER THAN THAT THE FLOOR IS YOURS ON THE CLOTHES. THANK YOU MANAGER REALLY APPRECIATE AGAIN ALL ALL THE WORK FOR YOUR COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF LOSS PREVENTION AGAIN ANY INDIVIDUAL CAN STILL HOUSE FOR A PAPER. OF THE FUEL THAT'S WHAT THEY FEEL THEY WANT BEFORE THEY WALK OUT THE STORE THEY HAVE THAT RIGHT THEY HAVE THAT ABILITY TO GET THAT RECEIPT. IN TERMS OF LOSS PREVENTION. FRANKLY THE MOST PROFITABLE RETAILER YOU JUST MENTIONED THEM. IN IN THIS COUNTRY ON A PER SQUARE FOOT BASIS AS APPLE AND THEY FRANKLY HAVE BEEN AT LEAST N THE BAY AREA PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST HIGH PROFILE TARGETS OF THEFT. WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO APPLE STORES AND STEALING APPLE WATCHES AND GRABBING PHONES AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF? BUT THE ONE THING YOU CAN'T GET AT APPLE STORES A PAPER SEE. APPLE HAS BEEN PAPERLESS FOR QUITE AWHILE AND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A PURCHASE YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS BUT YOU CAN'T GET A PAPER SEAT NOT AN APPLE STORE. TO RETAILERS ARE ALREADY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION IF YOU GO ACROSS THE STREET GET A CUP OF COFFEE CHECKER YOU MIGHT REALIZE THEY OFFER YOU MANY THINGS IN OFFER PAPERS. SO -- THE PAPER RECEIPTS RIGHT NOW AGAIN I TALKED ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF WASTE. ON TOP OF THAT THEY CONTAMINATE OUR WASTE STREAM. SO IF YOU WANT TO RECYCLE THE PAPER IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO RECYCLE IF YOU WANNA COMPOST PAPER THERE'S ONE THING I LEARNED I DID LEARN TWICE ARE CARRYING THIS BILL IF YOU WANT A COMPOST THIS PAPER. IT RUINS YOUR COMPOST. YOU CANNOT PUT IN YOUR COMPOST SO IF YOU GET A RECEIPT. THAT'S YOUR AGREES WITH PAPER THE PIZZA BOX CAN GO INTO THE COMPOST. THE RECEIPT CAN'T BECAUSE IT IS LAYS WITH THIS TOXIC CHEMICAL SO AGAIN. WE WE THINK THIS IS SOMETHING TO REALLY MAKE US AS CALIFORNIA'S RETHINK HOW WE ARE USING A PARTICULAR KIND OF PRODUCT WE NEED TO BE MUCH SMARTER ABOUT OUR WASTE WHETHER IT'S PLASTIC OR PAPER -- WE THINK THIS IS A VERY SMALL STEP AGAIN TO CONSUMERS HAVE EVERY ABILITY. TO ASK FOR THIS PAPER CA WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS MY STAFF WAS SAYING -- THERE'S AN ESTIMATE TO SWITCH OUT A ROLL OF PAPER OF THE BPA PAPER VERSUS THE TOXIC FREE PAPERS. BUT EVENTUALLY ADDITIONAL SEVEN DOLLARS A BOX SO WE THINK THAT THIS CAN BE DONE -- THAT IS THE CHAIR MENTIONED EUROPE WE THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE THE LEAD ON IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO LEAD -- AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH EVIDENCE IN TERMS OF OTHER STATES. WERE CALIFORNIA WE THINK WE CAN DO THIS AND WE FRANKLY HAVE PUT A NUMBER PROVISIONS AND EXEMPTIONS WITHIN SMALL BUSINESS AGAIN WE RAISE THE EXEMPTION FROM ONE MILLION TO TWO MILLION. SO IN ORDER TO BE IMPACTED -- YOU HAVE TO BE GROSSING MORE THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF RESTAURANTS. YOU CAN STILL GIVE A PAPER RECEIPT ME WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET THE INVOICE QUITE OFTEN WHEN THE RESTAURANT BRINGS YOU A BILL. THE BILL IS PAPER -- HI I'M PROBABLY LIKE MANY OF THE PEOPLE HI A PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD I SIGNED THE BILL AND I LEAVE ALL THE PAPER THERE I DON'T TAKE THE RESTAURANT RECEIPTS WITH ME UNLESS I'M. NEEDING TO HANDED OVER AS SOME SORT OF ACCOUNTS PROBABLY SMART BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THEM REALIZE THE ACURELATION OF TIME SHE VITON OUT THE COST OF EATING OUT YOU PROBABLY WOULD BE BETTER OFF NOT KNOWING. THANK YOU FAIR ENOUGH. AT LEAST THAT'S BEEN MY PROBLEM. THE SPECIALLY APPEARANCE SACRAMENTO -- BUT BUT AGAIN I I THINK -- I THINK WE FRANKLY PUT A NUMBER PROVISIONS TO REALLY MAKE THIS TRANSITION I FAIRLY SEAMLESS TRANSITION. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ALL YOUR WORK WITH US AND JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL FOR AB ONE SIXTY ONE THANK YOU. BYE WELL AS OF CENTER AKOWSKI MENTIONED THERE IS THIS WHOLE QUESTION ALSO OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE RECEIPTS -- YOU KNOW IT'S TO IT. I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT -- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT. BECAUSE SITE I THINK IT HELPS US KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING ABOUT MOVING INTO THE FUTURE AYE. I DON'T THINK THE SKY IS FALLING THERE MAY BE SOME CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE AND ODD GOES TO EQ THESE THESE BPA THIS IS. THIS IS TOXIC STUFF IN RIGHT AFTER EATING A MEAL YOU GET THAT RECEIPT AT A RESTAURANT -- AT YOU KNOW YOUR FINGERS IN NOW -- ENDED DOES BLEED INTO THE SKIN DOES IT NOT THESE ARE AT THE I MEAN THESE ARE SERIOUSLY TOXIC MATERIALS. BUT AGAIN THAT IS THE EQ -- COMMITTEES. ISSUE -- BUT I I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I I THINK IT'S A CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO CONTINUE HAVING -- AND OF COURSE THE THIS IS. THE ISSUES OF RELATIVE TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ARE HAVE NARROWED IS CONSIDERABLY SO I DON'T. FEEL THAT COMPELLED [inaudible] TO TO UP YOU KNOW. ENCOURAGE OTHERS WHO MAY NOT. THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA BUT I DO AND SO -- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN AND IT WITH YOUR UNDER A COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AND SOME THESE CAN ACTUALLY WE WE HD SOME MOCKING PRODUCTIVE INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WERE STILL WAITING FOR FEEDBACK FROM THE RETAILERS IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE CAN. WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM SATISFY THEIR NEEDS AS WELL TO OPERATE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT THERE IS IS YOUR MOTION THE MOVE.

THIS IS HOW WHILE ITEMS TO AB. TWO FORTY TWO GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU WILL GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT I DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU FOR THOSE. I AM PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FOUR TWO WHICH WILL REQUIRE ATTORNEYS AND JUDGES TO PARTAKE IN CONTINUAL EDUCATION ON IMPLICIT BIAS. EVERY THREE YEARS AND COURT PERSONNEL EVERY TWO YEARS. IMPLICIT BIASES THE UNCONSCIOUS AND UNINTENTIONAL MENTAL SHORT CUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN DEVELOP AND IT IMPACTS US ALL. IT IS OFTEN THE SUBTLE ASSOCIATIONS WE MAKE BETWEEN GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND STEREOTYPES ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE -- MY OTHER WITNESS WHO UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT ABLE TO STAY -- TALKS ABOUT THE NEURAL SCIENCE BEHIND -- IMPLICIT BIAS AND THE WAYS IN WHICH DIFFERENT TRIGGERS COME OFF AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHICH INFORMS HOW WE TREAT OUR OTHER FOLKS THAT -- EITHER LOOK LIKE US OR DO NOT LOOK LIKE US. MOST OF US WOULD LIKE TO BE FREE FOR OF BIAS ATTITUDES AND STEREOTYPES THAT LEAD US TO JUDGE PEOPLE BASED ON THE SOCIAL CATEGORIES THAT THEY BELONG. TO SUCH AS RACE AGE GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND ETHNICITY. BUT DESPITE PEOPLE'S BEST INTENTIONS RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT SUBJECTS CAN CONSCIOUSLY EMBRACE IDEAS OF FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY AND YET ON TESTS THAT MEASURE SUB CONSCIOUS TENDENCIES STILL SHOW A STRONG PROPENSITY TO LEAN ON STEREO TYPES. THE FILL IN THE BLANKS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T KNOW. IT IS CRITICAL THAT ATTORNEYS JUDGES AND COURT PERSONNEL RECEIVE TRAINING ON A ROUTINE BASIS TO RECOGNIZE THEIR IMPLICIT BIAS SEES AND TAKES STEPS TO COUNTERACT THEIR UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCES. UNCONSCIOUS AN IMPLICIT BIAS SEES CAN AND DO AFFECT THE DAY TO DAY DECISION MAKING PROCESS SEES EVEN THE MOST AWARE COURT OFFICERS. GET CHANGE CAN COME THROUGH EDUCATION INTERACTION AND CONVERSATION. IN THE STATE OF JUDICIARY JUDICIARY ADDRESS EARLIER THIS YEAR OUR VERY OWN SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE AND EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING FOR JUDGES AND UNCONSCIOUS. BIAS TRAINING MANDATORY FOR ALL COURT ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES. AB TWO FOUR TWO SIX TO AMPLIFY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE'S WORK ON IMPLICIT BIAS AND MANDATE THAT JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS BE TRAINED EVERY THREE YEARS AND COURT PERSONNEL EVERY TWO YEARS. TODAY WITH ME AND SUPPORT IS LISA HOLDER EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY LEGAL DIRECTOR. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION LET'S HEAR A WITNESS COULD GOOD AFTERNOON. AB GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS. ARE LISA HOLDER CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY ALIEN Là LECTURE ON CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING. AND I'M ADDRESSING YOU TODAY IN MY CAPACITY AS AS LEGAL DIRECTOR FOR THE EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY. AND OAKLAND BASS RACIAL JUSTICE ADVOCACY GROUP. SO EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY HAS BEEN STUDYING IMPLICIT BIAS FOR TWENTY YEARS SPECIFICALLY HOW IT AFFECTS INDIVIDUAL DECISION MAKING. AND HOW IT AFFECTS INSTITUTIONS. AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS. AND OUT WE ALSO CALL THAT UNCONSCIOUS BIAS. AND THOSE BIASES DEVELOPING DEVELOP DURING THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME TO EXPOSURE TO STEREO TYPES USUALLY RACIAL AND GENDER STEREOTYPES. NO IMPLICIT BIAS INFLUENCES OUR BELIEFS OUR ATTITUDES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR BEHAVIORS AND OUR ACTIONS. AND IT RUNS COUNTER. TO OUR BELIEFS AND OUR VALUES OFTEN WHICH IS WHAT SO INSIDIOUS ABOUT. IMPLICIT BIAS -- AND AS FAR AS INSTITUTIONS INDIVIDUAL IMPLICIT BIAS IS REPLICATED IN OUR INSTITUTIONS SO IT CAN END UP HAVING. A HUGE IMPACT INSTITUTIONALLY. NOTE. JUDGES ARE PEOPLE TOO SO THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT IMMUNE TO BIAS. YET ASTONISHINGLY STUDIES SHOW THAT 99% OF JUDGES SELF REPORT. THAT THEIR JUDICIAL DECISIONS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY RACIAL AND GENDER BIAS COMPARED TO THEIR COLLEAGUES. SO EVEN THOUGH COMMITTEE JUDGES EMBRACE THE CONCEPT OF IMPLICIT BIAS WHEN IT COMES. TO I'M. THINKING ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS THEM IN THE COURT ROOM AS BENCH OFFICERS. THEY MAY NOT -- COMPLETELY EXCEPT THAT IT IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON THEIR COURTROOM AND ON THEIR DECISION MAKING -- I'LL JUST POINT TO A COUPLE OF QUICK STUDIES COULD BECAUSE WHO ARE COMING UP ON THE TWO MINUTE Là GOT IT. SO JUST WHAT ONE IMPACTFUL STUDY IS THAT LOCALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO BLACK DEFENDANTS ARE HELD IN PRE TRIAL CUSTODY 62% LONGER THAN WHITE DEFENDANTS. AND BLACK DEFENDANTS RECEIVED DEFENDANTS CONVICTED OF THE SAME CRIMES. SO POINT BEING COUNTED BY IS% TRAINING IS A IS A PRACTICAL TOOL FOR JUDGES AND THEY'RE ALL THEIR OFFICERS WHO WORK WITH THEM -- TO BECOME AWARE. OF THEIR OWN BIASES AND TO ACCEPT THEIR BIASES AND TO LEARN TOOLS TO MANAGE AS A CRISIS. YOUR TESTIMONY THANK OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF COULD COME FORWARD NAME AFFILIATION PLEASE. VERY CLEAR SHE HARM BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. DOES IT IS THEN -- HAVE LEGAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SPROUT SUPPORT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU ARE THEIR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE SIDE OF ALL RIGHT SEEING NON I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. AS SOMEONE WHO'S PRACTICE LAW FOR NUMBER YEARS I CAN ATTEST TO THE GENDER BASED BIAS THAT -- CERTAINLY HAS EXISTED AND PROBABLY STILL DOES I FORTUNATELY BEEN RECOVERING FOR NUMBER YEARS I HAVE BEEN IN THE COURTROOM FOR A WHILE -- AND WE KNOW WITH LITIGANTS THERE ARE SIMILAR ISSUES OF MY ONLY CONCERN. HOW WE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A COMPETENT TRAINING YOU'VE GIVE TRIED TO IDENTIFY THAT? BUT PUTTING A BUNCH OF LAWYERS IN A ROOM. A BUNCH OF JUDGES IN A ROOM IS OFTEN A CHALLENGE TO GET THEM. TO PAY ATTENTION I SAID THERE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I AM MARRIED TO A RETIRED JUDGE BUT KNOWING THAT SO MANY. THINK THAT THEY AS YOU MENTIONED THEY SELF REPORT THERE'S NO BIAS IN WHAT THEY DO. IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN BE ASSURED WITH THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE. RIGHT SO -- AS A AS AS SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY MERRY TUNE ATTORNEY I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGE IT IS WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ROOM WITH THEM -- THIS IS A LITTLE LESS STILL LOOK AT THE HISTORY BY TO THE NO LESS TRUE OKAY -- THIS IS SO A I THINK THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ADDRESS SOME OF THAT BY MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S SOME COMPETENCY REQUIREMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO IDENTIFYING THE FOLKS THAT WILL BE -- DEM OVERSEEING THE TRAINING AND THERE IS AN IMPLEMENTATION -- PERIOD OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THIS DOESN'T KICK IN UNTIL THEN I THINK IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY START UNTIL TWENTY TWO SO IT ALLOWS FOR THERE TO BE SOMETIME IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WILL BE NO TRAINING THAT WILL COMPLETELY AROUND TO KEEP ANYTHING PARTICULARLY AND PLUS AT OUR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS. IN I AM NOT GOING TO SUGGEST THAT THIS BILL IS A SILVER BULLET FOR THAT BUT IT CERTAINLY -- WILL WORK TO ADDRESS THE BIAS IN WAYS THAT WILL HELP FOLKS COUNTER ACTED IN BRACE CITIC KNOWLEDGE IT SO THAT THEY CAN BE BETTER. AT THEIR JOBS IF IT IS ON THE BENCH ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO HAVING JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND HOW IT'S WIELDED AND WIN -- TWO OFFICERS OF THE COURT AND HOW THEY'RE INTERACTING -- WITH DEFENDANTS PLAINTIFFS IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- I THINK IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO HAVE -- MONITORING AND INPUT FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL BECAUSE I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN -- ACTUALLY VERY SUPPORTIVE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS BILL -- AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OFFER SOME GOOD COUNSEL IN TERMS OF HOW YOU WOULD PUT TOGETHER PARTICULAR -- CURRICULUM. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- THE BILL IS NOT ABOUT SORT OF PLACING BLAME WERE HAVING A GOTCHA. WITH REGARDS TO JUDGES AND LAWYERS BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT AND PUT FOLKS ON DISPLAY I THINK YOU WOULD SEE ON THE EXACT OPPOSITE EFFECT OF WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN WITH THIS BILL. BUT IT'S IN THE QUIET SPACES -- YOU KNOW IN THE OFFICES IN THE TRAINING IN THE WORK -- WELL IN THE THE THE WORK SPACES BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WERE FOLKS WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO HAVE HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT M. C. ELLIE IS ALSO A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND YOU'RE NOT PUTTING YOUR YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW TAKING A TEST AND PUTTING THE RESULTS ON BLAST BUT YOUR INTERNALIZING WHAT YEAR -- RECEIVING THROUGH THAT CONTINUE A CONTINUING EDUCATION AND THEN INTEGRATING AND PROCESSING IT IN YOUR DAILY WORK THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS. THERE'S A MOTION. I'M SORRY CENTER BORCHERS. FORGIVE ME AFFIRMED IF. MAYBE THIS QUESTION WAS POSED BEFORE ONES LIKE IT -- SO WE ALREADY HAVE THE ELIMINATION OF BIAS REQUIREMENT -- FOR THE M. C. ELLIE [inaudible] AND THIS IS NOT JUST A SUBSET OF THAT THIS WOULD BE -- IN ADDITIONAL ANA. OUR REQUIREMENT WITHIN THAT. TWENTY FIVE IS THAT IT. IT'S A PART OF IT. SO WE'RE NOT. RIGHT IT'S A IT'S A SUBSET OF THE ELIMINATION OF BIAS REQUIREMENT CORRECT. ALRIGHT BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN THE JUDICIARY -- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE MANDATORY TRAINING -- LIKE I THINK ALL OF US HAVE TO HAVE -- SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. REQUIREMENTS. IS THAT CORRECT. RIGHT RIGHT -- BUT IF YOU IS IT I MEAN. I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS FORD IF YOU DIDN'T THINK WAS IMPORTANT -- BUT THE ELIMINATION OF OF A BIAS IN IN THE CURRENT M. C. ELLIE -- ROSTER OF AVAILABLE CLASSES AND WHATNOT. IS THAT NOT. IS THAT NOT. SATISFACTORY. OR THE JUDGE IS TO NOT HAVE TO TAKE THE CAR THEY DON'T HAVE EM SEALY REQUIREMENTS IT'S LAWYERS WHO HAVE PLAYED LAWYERS LAWYERS YEAH. BUTFOR THOSE IN A SUPERVISORY POSITION THEY STILL HAVE TO TAKE THE ARE REQUIRED TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS. IS THAT CORRECT SO THEY'RE DIFFERENT. KINDS OF TRAININGS THAT DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE TAKES SO ATTORNEYS ARE DEALING THEY HAVE THEY TAKE THEIR MCL EITHER DIFFERENT TRAINING. FOR JUDGES THIS IS INTEGRATING AND BOOK IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING INTO THE HOURS THAT THERE ARE ANY REQUIRED T TAKE SO. UNLIKE US LEADS TAKES SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND WE TAKE ETHICS -- THERE BEEN SOME REPORTS THAT SUGGEST THAT. THAT MAYBE NOT THE BEST WAY TO RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION -- BUT IF YOU'RE INTEGRATING IT INTO HOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING YOUR DAILY WORK AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE ITS IMPACT. ACROSS ALL OF WHAT YOU DO RATHER THAN COMING IN TO JUST TALK ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THIS ONE ISSUE -- BECAUSE AS WE DO NOW IMPLICIT BIAS YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T START AT NINE O'CLOCK IN IN THAT FIVE OR IT DOESN'T START WITH ONE CASE AND THEN AND WITH ANOTHER. BUT IT SHOULD BUT JUST OF THE FINISH UP YOUR ATTORNEYS TAKE MCLA AND REQUIRED. JUDGES ARE THOSE IN A SUPERVISORY POSITION OUR FIRST WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE -- A SOME SORT OF TRAINING -- LIKE WE DO FOR ALL THINGS YOU YOU JUST SETS OF JUDGES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO THAT AS WELL. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. TAKING THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SUPPORTS THIS SO THAT'S THERE WAS TESTIMONY WE HAD. TO GET HEARD PREVIOUSLY AS WELL SO. WE HAVE A MOTION -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

TO HELP IMPROVE THE BILL MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLARIFYING IT IN THE IN THE NECESSARY NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS WHICH I'M HAPPY TO TAKE HIS AUTHORS AMENDMENT. SO WHAT WE TRY TO SOLVE HERE AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE ME TOO MOVEMENT IN A LOT OF GREATER AWARENESS OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT HAPPENS IN ORGANIZATIONS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF THAT THAT TO ME HAS BEEN TROUBLING IN THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE. IS OFTENTIMES IN A SETTLEMENT. AROUND A SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE VICTIM. IS WHO MAKES A CLAIM AGAINST THE EMPLOYER MAKES CRIME AGAINST A BAD ACTOR IS OFTEN THE ONE WHO LEAVESYOU ORGANIZATION AND LEAD TO ORGANIZATION. WITH AN OBLIGATION. WITH A NO HIRE AGREEMENT OBLIGATED NEVER COME BACK TO THAT ORGANIZATION NEVER TO BE AVAILABLE TO BE HIRED AGAIN BY THAT ORGANIZATION SUBSIDIARIES OR OTHERS AND IT JUST SEEMS. THAT WHAT WE ARE PERPETUATING THAT CASES RETHINK. THE VICTIM BECAUSE WE ARE CLOSING OFF CAREERS CLOSE ENOUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHERS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. IT WOULD MAKE AS A MATTER OF POLICY. THE NO HIGHER PROVISIONS IN THESE KINDS OF SETTLEMENTS. NOT OPERATIVE NOW THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS A WITH THE IN THE THE AMENDMENT ADDRESSES WE ARE STILL TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BAD ACTORS CAN IN FACT BE SEPARATED FROM. THE FROM THE COMPANIES AND THE THE THOSE THINGS THAT THAT CERTAINLY CAN HAPPEN BUT THESE NO WE HIRE PROVISIONS TEND TO BE USED AS A MATTER OF COURSE. AND AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY WE THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE. NO LONGER OPERATIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTE TEACHER IF YOU WANT -- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANDREA ROW SO I HAVE BEEN A LOT PRACTICE YOU'RE UP FOR A DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT VICTIMS. IN ELK GROVE AND I'M HERE JUST TO ACCOMPANY MY FORMER. CLIENT CARMEN FIELD WHO'S GOING TO TELL YOU TODAY ABOUT HER STORY. THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED IF YOU'D MOVE THE MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOU. GREAT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. MY NAME IS CARMEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CARMEN FIELDS. TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND MOVE THE MICHAEL CLOSER BECAUSE I FEELING YOU'VE GOT A SOFT VOICE. OKAY. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU MY STORY ABOUT HOW I LOST MY CAREER BECAUSE I WAS FORCED TO RESIGN AND AGREE TO A NO REHIRE BECAUSE AS A CONDITION OF SETTLING MY SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMING. I STARTED WORKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND AND TEN IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SHORTLY AFTER LETTER JOHNSON WAS HIRED. BY C. H. P.. HE BEGAN SEXUALLY HARASSING ME AND OTHER FEMALE CO WORKERS IT STARTED WITH HIM INSISTING THAT I HIGH FIVE HIM THEN GRABBING MY HAND WHEN I DECLINED. I ASKED HIM TO STOP BUT HE WOULD NOT. I QUICKLY PER IT QUICKLY PROGRESS TO HIM RUNNING HIS FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR. I'M DOING MY HAIR WHEN I WHEN I WOULD PUT IN A BUN. AND FORCING HIS WAY ON TO SITTING ON MY LAP. THESE ACTIONS WERE WITNESSED BY SEVERAL OTHER EMPLOYEES INCLUDING SUPERVISORS I DEMANDED THAT HE LEAVE ME ALONE I FREQUENTLY COMPLAINED TO MY COMMANDER. WHO SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO? ABOUT THE HARASSMENT. ON MARCH THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWELVE JIM. JOHNSON ATTACKED ME DURING THE INTO A PRIVATE TALK. BY MY WRIST AND ATTEMPTING TO KISS ME. I'M PUSHING HIS BODY AGAINST MINE. AS I FOUGHT HIM OFF. I REPORTED THIS CRIME TO THE STAGE THREE MANAGERS INCLUDING MY DIVISION CHIEF A UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER. I DEMAND OF THE CHIEF PROTECT ME FROM JOHNSON INVESTIGATING INCIDENTS THE SHIFT RESPONSE WAS TO LEAVE LENNY AND HIS MANAGER -- POSITION AND ADMINISTRATIVELY TRANSFER YOU TO A LESS DESIRABLE POSITION. THE CHP EVENTUALLY ASSIGNED AN INVESTIGATOR BUT THE CHP REFUSE TO COMPLETE THEIR INVESTIGATION AND I WAS LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO FILE MY COMPLAINT WITH THE EEOC. ALTHOUGH JOHNSON HAD ADMITTED TO SEXUALLY HARASSING SEVERAL FEMALES UNDER HIS COMMAND WHILE HE WAS A PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE THE SIEGE BE GRANTED HIM PERMANENT CIVIL SERVICE STATUS INFORMING HIM THAT HIS BEHAVIOR QUOTE THAT THE STANDARDS AS EACH BE EXPECTED OF ITS MANAGERS. ACCORDING TO PUBLIC RECORDS JOHNSON CONTINUES TO WORK FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MAKES 40% MORE THAN THE DAY WHEN HE ATTACKED ME. THE RETALIATION AGAINST ME HOWEVER IS CONTINUED I WAS DENIED PROMOTIONS BECAUSE I FILED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT. MY DAUGHTER WORKS FOR THE CITY TREE AND HER SUPERVISOR BRAG ABOUT NOT PROMOTING ME BECAUSE I HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT. THE CHP PRESSURED ME TO SETTLE THE CASE. AND THEY WERE ADAMANT THAT I BE FORCED TO RESIGN. I DID NOT WANT TO RESIGN. I LOVE MY JOB AND THE FRIENDS I HAVE. THE MORE I PUSH AGAINST SETTLING BY RESIGNING THE MORE THE GROSS SO THEY GOT. WITH ME AND MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS. I WAS INFORMED THAT THEY INTEND TO DEPOSE FAMILY. FRIENDS GOING BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD. ALL I EVER WANTED WAS TO BE PROTECTED FROM JONES. AND TO SEE IF PEOPLE CLEAR THAT WAS NEVER AN OPTION. AS PART OF MY SETTLEMENT I WAS FORCED TO AGREE TO A NO REHIRE PROVISION MEANING I COULD NO LONGER WORK FOR THE C. H. P. OR ANY OF ITS DEPARTMENT AREAS OR DIVISIONS. THIS DESPITE HAVING OVER TWELVE YEARS OF JOB EXPERIENCE SIX YEARS OF EXEMPLARY PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS FROM C. H. P. AND A MASTER'S DEGREE IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY OTHER SIEGE CAM PLOY USED TO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAVE TOLD ME THEY WILL NEVER REPORT FROM FEAR WHAT THEY WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS AS I DID. IT IS UNFAIR THAT THE ADMITTED HELP SEXUAL AROUSAL CONTINUES TO WORK FOR THE STATE RECEIVING PROMOTIONS AND RAISES WHILE I PREVENTED FROM FURTHER EMPLOYMENT WITH. SIMPLY BECAUSE I ASKED TO BE PROTECTED FROM HARASSMENT. THIS IS NOT A HE SAID SHE SAID SITUATION HE FREELY ADMITTED TO ALL OF HIS ACTIONS. AND HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE EMBARRASSED OR ASHAMED. REQUIRING VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO RESIGN AND AGREE TO NEVER BE REHIRED IS THE ULTIMATE FORM. OF INSTITUTIONAL RETALIATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I THINK YOU'RE. PART OF THE REASON WE'RE HERE. AT LEAST ON THIS BILL I IF YOU COULD BE BRIEF REFLECTION AND MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA STANDER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL -- ESSENTIALLY THE QUESTION HERE IS THAT THESE CLAUSES IT BECOMES SURREPTITIOUSLY VERY COMMON AND PRETTY STANDARD IN ALL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS. AND THE QUESTION IS WHY DO EMPLOYERS NEED TO INCLUDE THESE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. THEY SAY IT'S BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THEM TO PROHIBIT AN EMPLOYEE WHO'S WHO'S DONE SME HARM OR ENGAGE IN SOME MISCONDUCT FROM BEINGREHIRED HOWEVER THEY DON'T NEED A NO REHIRE CLAUSE IN A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO TO ACCOMPLISH THAT TASK. THEY CAN SIMPLY REFUSED TO REHIRE THEM AND HAVE A VALID CLAIM FOR WIDE ARAMBULA JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY THEY FAILED TO REHIRE THEM OR DENIED THEM RE HIGHER. SO THE REASON WHY THEY ARE IMPOSING ALL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS ARE VIRTUALLY ALL IS THAT ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO GET AROUND OUR ANTI RETALIATION LAWS -- AND NOT RE HIRE SOMEONE SIMPLY BECAUSE HERE SHE SPOKE OUT ABOUT A WORKPLACE RIGHT VIOLATION WE KNOW THAT EMPLOYERS DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO RE HIRE SOMEONE WHO'S SPOKEN OUT ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS. AND THIS TYPE OF NO REHIRE CLAUSE REALLY INSULATES THEM FROM ANY TYPE OF RETALIATION CLAIM FOR FAILING TO RE HIRE SOMEONE WHO HAS FILED SUCH A COMPLAINT OR CLAIM -- THESE CAUSES REALLY HAVE NO LEGAL PURPOSE BUT TO INSULATE EMPLOYERS FROM LIABILITY -- FOR RETALIATION FROM SOME AGAIN SOMEONE WHO'S FILED A CLAIM AND REALLY ARE UNNECESSARY AS THEY WILL HAVE A VALID JUSTIFICATION FOR DENYING NEW EMPLOYMENT SOMEONE WHO IS ENGAGED IN SOME KIND OF BAD CONDUCT. OF FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE PROJECTS COSPONSORED HIS BILL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU PLEASE STEP FORWARD NAME AN AFFILIATION. VERY CLEAR SHE HARM TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION ALSO PROUD COSPONSORED THE SPELL STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. WHAT RICH WALLACE WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU? PAMELA LOPEZ ON BEHALF OF WORK EQUITY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. LAURIE FURSTENFELD FROM THE CHILD CARE LAWCENTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND IF WE COULD MAKE WAY FOR THE TWO WITNESSES THAT. IF YOU WANTED. pLIKE TO STAY OR SOME WOULD LIKE TO STAY AS A CAPTION EXPERT WE JUST NEED TO CHAIRS. AND I JUST WANT TO CAUTION I MAY HAVE TO EXCUSE MYSELF OF THAT BECAUSE I HAVE A TIME CERTAIN TO TRY. TO THE PRESENT A COUPLE BILLS BUT THEY'RE NOT READY YET SO IF I DO LEAVE IT'S NOT FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN I'VE BEEN CALLED TO TESTIFY. ON THOSE OF THE BILL SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND START WITH THE OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED. TO THIS PROPOSAL -- AS THE PER -- PROPONENT SUGGESTED AS THE AUTHOR PRESENTED THIS IS AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS -- SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND PROTECT -- INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE CLAIMED HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL ADDRESSES THAT. BUT THE CHALLENGE WITH THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AS IT INCLUDES BOTH THE VICTIM OF HARASSMENT AND GIVES THAT PART -- THAT INDIVIDUAL PROTECTION AS WELL AS THE HARASSER THEMSELVES LAST YEAR WE SPONSORED AB SIXTEEN OH SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN WHO ADDRESSED INFORMATION WITH REGARDS TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT BECAUSE AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH REGARDS TO THE HARASSERS. IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL ONCE THEY ARE. WIMPS WE INVESTIGATE AND WE ALLEGE OR FIND THAT THERE HAS BEEN HARASSMENT BY THE INDIVIDUAL THAT INDIVIDUAL FILE DEFAMATION CLAIMS AGAINST THE EMPLOYER FOR SUGGESTING THEY ENGAGED IN HARASSMENT. I'M ALSO FILED DEFAMATION CLAIMS AGAINST THE ACTUAL EMPLOYEE WHO ALLEGE HARASSMENT AS WELL AS WITNESSES WHO ENGAGED AND PARTICIPATED IN THE INVESTIGATION. RIGHT NOW UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THE DEFINITION OF AN AGGRIEVED EMPLOYEE IS ANYBODY WHO HAS FILED A CLAIM AGAINST THE EMPLOYER THAT INCLUDES THE HARASSER WHO FILES A CLAIM AGAINST US FOR DEFAMATION WHEN WE THE LEISURE FOUND THAT THEY'VE ENGAGED IN HARASSMENT SO WE HAVE A CONCERN. THAT YES THIS MAY HELP PROTECT THOSE VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT WE AGREE WITH THAT -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN THAT IT ALSO PROTECTS THE BAD ACTORS WHO HAVE FILED -- CLAIMS AGAINST THE EMPLOYER NOW I ALSO AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE PROPONENTS THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN LAW THAT REQUIRES US TO REHIRE ANY INDIVIDUAL THAT'S TRUE. FOR THE VICTIM OF HARASSMENT AND THAT'S TRUE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL WHO ENGAGED IN HARASSMENT HOWEVER WHAT THIS DOES IS CHANGE THE DYNAMIC IN THE CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST US WE NOW HAVE. TO ATTENTION TO DEFEND A RETALIATION CLAIM WHERE'S BEFORE WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT A BREACH OF CONTRACT WITH AN AGREEMENT AND THESE ARE NOT TAKE IT OR LEAVE -- WHERE THE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL SO AGAIN -- IT ADDS TO LITIGATION AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IF SOMEBODY'S GOING TO FILE A DEFAMATION CLAIM AGAINST A VICTIM OF HARASSMENT ALLEGE THAT THEIR DEFAMING THEM. IT'S NOT THAT FAR STRETCH TO THINK THAT THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL FILE A RETALIATION CLAIM AGAINST AN EMPLOYER IF THERE'S NOT A NO REHIRE CLAUSE IN THAT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST [inaudible] THANK YOU. MINUTES PLEASE IT'S RETURN MEMBERS MIGHT PULL OUT ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAW COUNCIL AND THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE FED PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR -- I THOUGHT THAT THE ANALYSIS DID A GOOD JOB GOING THROUGH THE INTRICACIES OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP AT ISSUE HERE I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL IS ADDED OVER PLEADS THE CASE. THAT APPLIES TO EVERY FORM OF DISPUTE. ANY COMPLAINT OF AN EMPLOYMENT NATURE FILED BY THE EMPLOYEE. APPLIES WHETHER THE EMPLOYEE IS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL OR NOT THESE ARE USUALLY HIGHLY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS AND THIS WOULD OVERRIDE THE DECISION OF OF BOTH SIDES COUNSEL TO ENGAGE IN THE AGREEMENT -- IT IS NICE TO CLARIFY THAT NOTHING IN THE BILL REQUIRES RE HIGHER BUT AS MS BARRERA NOTED IT SHIFTS THE DEBATE FOR WHY WE DIDN'T RE HIRE THE EMPLOYEE OFTEN THIS IS. FAIRLY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT WHERE BOTH SIDES WANT TO END THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP THERE'S AGREEMENT NOT TO REHIRE. INTERESTING THAT THE EXAMPLES THAT WE WERE GIVEN -- SO FAR I'M SURE THEY HAPPEN IN THE PRIVATESECTOR BUT THEY'RE PREDOMINATELY PUBLIC SECTOR -- EXAMPLES SO WE THINK THAT THE BILL IS OVER BROAD WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO SEE IF WE CAN NARROW IT TO THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SITUATIONS THE EGREGIOUS ONES LIKE WE HEARD FROM THE WITNESS. AND NOT OVER PLEAD THE BILL AND HAVE IT APPLY TO BROADLY TO ALL DISPUTES. ALL AGREEMENTS AND WHETHER REPRESENTED OR NOT FOR THAT REASON WE'RE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT -- OUR STEAM TO CHAIR WOMAN I HAS LEFT FOR ANOTHER -- PRESENTATION SO WITH THE GAVEL IS PASSED ON TO ME AND WE MAY VERY WELL FIND OURSELVES SITUATION WHERE THE GAVEL COULD BE PASSED TO SOMEBODY ELSE -- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- WE'VE HAD -- THE TO UPON REPRESENTATIVES SPEAKING NOW WILL OPEN UP -- TO OTHER FOLKS IF YOU COULD IDENTIFY YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION AND AND YOUR VERY BRIEF A STATEMENT OF OPPOSITION THANK YOU OF SEAN LEWIS REPORTS ABOUT THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF IN A BUSINESS AND ARE TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS VERY CONCERNED. WITH THE INCREASED THREAT OF LITIGATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. YOU. JR MEMBERS DON'T GIVEN FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION -- ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL CORBITT REPRESENTING THE C. SACK ACCESS INSURANCE AT FORTY WHICH REPRESENTS MORE THAN SIXTEEN HUNDRED LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER MEMBER THE PUBLIC WISH TO COMMENT ON THIS ITEM IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK -- TO THE DAIS [inaudible] CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I FIRST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THINK THE WITNESS WHO COURAGEOUSLY SHARED HER STORY. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S STILL IN THE ROOM BUT SHE MAKES A STRONG CASE. FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IS ANYONE OF THAT CH P. OFFICER WHO ENGAGED IN THE HARASSMENT IS STILL EMPLOYED BY THE CHP IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT HE IS YES YOU ARE HE IS THAT. HE IS STILL EMPLOYED -- AS A MATTER OF FACT HE WAS THE MOTIVE SEVERAL TIMES BUT HE STILL CONTINUES TO BE EMPLOYED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I WAS JUST CURIOUS IN IT'S ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THE INJUSTICE THAT SHE DESCRIBED. THE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR -- IN I SUPPORT THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS LEGISLATION HAVING REPRESENTED PLAINTIFFS IN EMPLOYMENT CASES. SOMETIMES A PLAINTIFF WHO HAS BEEN TERMINATED. DOES NOT WANT TO RETURN TO THE WORKPLACE. WHERE THE DISCRIMINATION HAPPENED? IN. IT CAN BE A FACTOR IN IN NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT TO INCLUDE A PROVISION. OF NOT RETURNING. TO LEVERAGE MORE MONETARY COMPENSATION. TO THE COMPLAINING PLAINTIFF WITH THIS BILL PROHIBIT AND NEGOTIATED. ARMS LENGTH AGREEMENT NOT A MANDATORY. NOT COMING FROM THE EMPLOYER THAT YOU -- HAVE TO SUBMIT YOUR RESIGNATION BUT WITH THIS PREVENT. THE COMPLAINING PLAINTIFF FROM NEGOTIATING. THEY DON'T WANT TO RETURN. THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE. THE EMPLOYER DOESN'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO OFFER THEM THAT THE COURT MAY BE IS. WHAT WOULD REQUIRE REEMPLOYMENT? BUT THE PLAINTIFF MAY BE ABLE TO SECURE. SOMETHING THAT IS OF GREATER INTEREST TO THEM IT WOULD AND WE'RE TRYING NOT NECESSARILY TAKE LEVERAGE AWAY FROM THE PLAINTIFFS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THESE NO REHIRE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN USED. THERE USED MORE. AGREE JUST LEAVE THAN BENEFICIALLY IN THAT STANDPOINT SO TO MISTER BELOW ITS POINT. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE SORT OF OVER SUBSCRIBING THIS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERN OF HOW THESE THINGS HAVE COME INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND THEY'RE OFTEN PITCH SAID. I'VE BEEN ON DIRTY ON THE INSIDE ON THESE ON THESE QUESTIONS THEY'RE SORT OF PITCHED AS THIS IS A STANDARD FORM AGREEMENT WE WANT. TO JUST PUT YOU IN THE SAME POSITION AS EVERYONE ELSE. THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A LOT OF CHOICE GIVEN. THAT'S WILL WORKING AGAINST I AM SENSITIVE TO POTENTIALLY. I AM POTENTIALLY TRYING TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THEN MAYBE WE NEEDED TO AYE I DON'T WANT TO GO OVERLY BROAD ON THIS. BUT I WORRY THAT IF WE RESTRICT THIS A LOT WE'RE GONNA BE FACILITATING THE KINDS OF AGREEMENTS. AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING IN THE PAST AND AGAIN THESE ARE VICTIMS REALLY BEING RE VICTIMIZED. THAT IF THE VICTIM WANTS TO LEAVE AND GETS A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THERE'S NO OBLIGATION FOR THEM TO COME BACK WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT SITUATION BUT REALIZE. TOO THAT WITH A LOT OF COMPANIES WITH A LOT OF PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT ARE MENTIONED. THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF RELATED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THEN OFF THE TABLE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY MAY NOT REALIZE. YES ITS COMPLEXITIES EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY COMPLEX AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO JUST TAKE A A TOOL OFF THE TABLE THAT HAS BEEN MISUSED MORE THAN IT'S BEEN BENEFICIALLY USE. AND RE BALANCE THAT PLAYING FIELD A LITTLE BIT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT DID EITHER OF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT TO THEM I JUST WANTED AND WE WERE GENERALLY REPRESENT LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO GO SHEET THE TERMS THIS ONE INCLUDED OF THESE THEIR SETTLEMENT. AGREEMENTS AND ARE NOT ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ANY KIND OF HIGHER COMPENSATION. FOR THIS PROVISION BUT RATHER REQUIRED TO TAKE IT ON A TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT BASIS -- AND OFTEN AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOME POINTED OUT DON'T ALWAYS REALIZE THE BREADTH OF THE AND THE SCOPE OF THESE PROVISIONS AND BELIEVE IT MAY JUST BE FOR THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER AND THEN COME TO FIND LATER WHEN THEY APPLY FOR A JOB AT WHAT SEEMS TO BE A SEPARATE. ENTITY THAT THEY'RE NOW BARRED FROM EMPLOYMENT IN A VARIETY OF OTHER CONTACTS THAT THEY HADN'T EVEN UNDERSTOOD WOULD BE THE CASE. THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL MEN WITH RESPECT TO LEAST ONE A CONCERNS OF OF THE OPPONENTS -- NOTHING THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE TERMINATION OF A BAD ACTOR WHO'S BEEN THE PERPETRATOR OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE IS THAT CORRECT THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT NOW THE TERMS OF THIS WOULD STILL APPLY. BY COMPANIES HAVE THE ABILITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF THE POOLS AND AND GIVEN THEM THE STATE OF EMPLOYMENT LAW. POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES ARE OFTEN VERY HIGHLY THAT SO THEY ARE ABLE TO KEEP A RECORD THEY THEY KNOW WHO THEY SHOULD NOT BE RE HIRING. AND SO THE THE COMMENT ABOUT. CREATING AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO CREATE ADDITIONAL LITIGATION THAT THAT THE FEARS RUN BECAUSE THAT RETALIATORY SO SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SEPARATED SOMEBODY WHO'S A BAD ACTOR HAS BEEN SEPARATE FROM COMPANY. AND THEN APPLIES BACK THAT THE NEXUS TO THE ORIGINAL CLAIM THAT GOT THEM DISMISSED OR NEGOTIATED DISMISSAL OR OR LEFT THE COMPANY IS BROKEN ONCE THEY'RE NO LONGER HIGHER. SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE A RETALIATION CLAIM FOR THE FACT OF THEM NOT GETTING HIRED WHEN THE COMPANY IS. FREE TO JUST SAY YOU'RE NOT WE'RE NT GOING TO HIRE YOU. AND A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WHEN COMMITTEES ASIDE NOT TO HIRE SOMEBODY OR PUBLIC AGENCIES IS THE CASE. THEY'RE NOT EXPLAINING MUCH THEY DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN MUCH WE'RE NOT ASKING THEM TO EXPLAIN MUCH. BUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT REQUIRING THEM TO BE HEARD BACK YET SO I THINK THE HIRING ORGANIZATION BE A PUBLIC AGENCY A PRIVATE AGENCY. HAS PLENTY OF TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT BRINGING A BAD ACTOR BACK INTO THE K. INTO THEIR FOLD WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT WE DO NOT WANT AND I WOULD COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT. BUT ON BALANCE HOW THESE CLAUSES HAVE BEEN USED I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST TAKE THEM OFF THE TABLE AS A TOOL AND THEN LET THE ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUE TO FUNCTION THE WAY THAT THEY FUNCTION AND MANAGE THEIR EMPLOYEES RIGHT NOW IF THAT FORMER BAD ACTOR EMPLOYEE. SIX RE HIGHER IN IS DENIED AND TRIES TO FILE A CASE RETALIATION NOTHING PREVENTS THE EMPLOYER FROM SHARING THE EVIDENCE. OF WHY THEY WERE LET GO TO BEGIN WITH. OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. ANY OTHER A NUMBER THE COMMITTEE. WE'RE KIND OF SPARSE AT THIS POINT -- LECTURE WAS GOING TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE WITH HIS HIS COMMENTS JUST JUST FOR CLARITY. SO IN INDIVIDUAL ON LEAVES. AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT AND TRY STERN RE HIGHER AND FOR THE REASONS THAT HE JUST MENTIONED. IS NOT HIRED -- IS THAT DISCOVERABLE INFORMATION. THE THE PAST HISTORY YEAH A SORT OF DEPENDS ON WHO THE PARTS OF THEIR GOING BACK TO THE SAME COMPANY -- YEAH I WOULD I WOULD THINK IF IF THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A DISCRIMINATION CLAIM. BUT IN TALKING TO THE EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS MOST OF THEM IT'S IT'S NOT A CLAIM THAT LAWYERS WOULD NECESSARILY TAKE ON BECAUSE AGAIN THE BE MAKING A DISCRIMINATION CLAIM FOR THE CURRENT NON HIGHER DECISION. THAT REALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO. THE DEAD HAS BROKEN THEIR NEXUS WITH THE THE REASON FOR THE TERMINATION. SO THE EMPLOYER COULD SAY. YOU ARREST OR ANY INTERNALLY MAKE THAT. MAKE THAT DETERMINATION THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF A CANDIDATE WE WANT TO HIRE AND THEY HAVE THOSE RECORDS THEY COULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO THEN IF THAT POTENTIAL EMPLOYEE DID SU. THEN GET THERE THROUGH THE DISCOVERY PROCESS THEY MAY THEN GET ACCESS TO THEIR PRIOR EMPLOYMENT RECORD. AS LONG AS THE COMPANY HAD DOCUMENTED THE REASON FOR THAT DETERMINATION AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BOLSTER. YOUR CRIMINALS HIGHER SO -- THERE WERE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU HAVE AGREED TO YES OUT. WAS THIS A RECENT. EVENT IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN THAT NOTE THE IS IS IT WAS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OR WITHIN THE LAST WEEK IN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE GUY. SO I'M LOOKING AT ONE OF THEM WHICH SUBSECTION BEING. NOTHING EN SUBDIVISION SHALL REQUIRE AN EMPLOYER TO CONTINUE TO EMPLOYER HIGHER PERSON WHEN THERE'S A LEGITIMATE NON DISCRIMINATORY. OR NON RETALIATORY REASON FOR TERMINATING THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP. OR REFUSING TO RE HIRE THE PERSON CORRECT AND WE AND WE I THINK THAT THE THAT THE BILL. THAT THAT'S A CLARIFICATION I THINK THE WE WERE SILENT ON THAT I DON'T THINK WE SET UP ANY OBLIGATION TO REHIRE OR INTERFERE WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP BUT BASED ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. WE'RE PUTTING THESE PROVISIONS AND HAVING WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO INTERRUPT THE ABILITY THE COMPANY TO NOT REHIRE. FOR THE THEY COULD ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH AS AN EMPLOYEE ESPECIALLY THE BAD ACTOR TO SEPARATE [inaudible] OKAY. AND NOTHING IN THE SUBDIVISION NOTHING IN THIS SHOP PRECLUDE THE EMPLOYER AND AGREE PERSON FROM MAKING AN AGREEMENT TO END A CURRENT EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP. CORRECT AND AND THAT WAS BECAUSE WE WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR WAS THAT IF THERE IS A BAD ACTOR AND THAT ORGANIZATION WANTS TO TERMINATE THAT BAD ACTOR THAT COULD BE DONE THROUGH A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IF YOU WELL THEY THEY COULD AGREE. TO PART WAYS WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT STILL COULD HAPPEN OR NOT INTERFERE WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP WE'RE REALLY MORE FOCUSED ON THE REHIRE PROVISION TO OF THE NO REHIRE PROVISION. THAT WOULD NOT BE EVEN FOR A BAD ACTOR. THAT WOULD NOT BE A PART OF THEIR SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BUT THEY COULD CERTAINLY SETTLE THEY COULD CERTAINLY. MOVE THAT EMPLOYEE OUT AND THEN THERE'S NO OBLIGATION TO BRING THEM BACK AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE FOLKS WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION -- ARE FULLY AWARE OF THESE AMENDMENTS. AND STILL MAINTAIN OPPOSITION POSITIONS BUT SPEAK FOR THEM BUT OBVIOUSLY I'M LOOKING AT NODDING HEADS AT THE MOMENT YEAH OKAY -- ANY OTHER FINAL. ALL RIGHT -- DO WE HAVE THE MOTION. IN THE IS THIS WITH THE AMENDMENTS WERE CISCO NEXT. HAS AMENDED TO FLOOR. OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE A MOTION BY AS CENTER DRAWS A TO PASS A MINUTE TO THE FLOOR.

JUST A QUICK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF I MAY UM SO THIS PERTAINS TO COMMUNITY PLANS. I THINK DID I HEAR YOU SAY GENERAL PLANS EARLIER. THIS WOULD BE -- FOR COMMUNITY PLANS ARE NOT THE NOT THE GENERAL FEDERAL PLAN FEDERAL PLANS AS WELL. PLANS NOT THE GENERAL PLAN ALRIGHT SO THE LEVEL OF ITS. OF DETAIL IN COMMITTEE PLANS -- IT IS NOT AS SPECIFIC AS AS WOULD BE A SPECIFIC PLAN ACTUALLY SOMETIMES THE COMMUNITY PLANS IS EVEN MORE GRANULAR AND A LARGE CITY LIKE LOS ANGELES THEIR GENERAL PLAN IS BUILT ON THIS YEAR IS NETWORK OF COMMUNITY PLANS THAT ARE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED WITH THE COMMUNITY. IN A CALL OVER A COURSE OF YEARS TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT AREAS THEY WANT TO UPS OWN WHERE THEY WANT TO DOWN ZONE WHERE THEY WANT THEIR DEVELOPMENT TO BE. A CITY OF GLENDALE SPENT WHEN I WAS ON THE COUNCIL MANY YEARS DEVELOPING THEIR SOUTHLAND A COMMUNITY PLAN WHICH IS A VERY IN DEPTH DOCUMENT THAT THINK IT'S FOLDED INTO THE GENERAL PLAN BUT IT'S THE PLAN THAT GOVERNS THAT COMMUNITY. AND THE REASON WHY WE'VE OR WERE TAKING THIS APPROACH IS BECAUSE IT'S THE GENERAL PLAN LEVEL THAT'S BEING SUED I'M IN THE CITIES ARE NOT SUING OVER THE ENTIRE GENERAL PLAN. THERE ARE. THERE'S TRYING TO PREVENT THE CITY FROM A DOCK FROM ADOPTING THESE THESE COMMUNITY PLANS. OKAY SO THE INDIVIDUALS ARE CHALLENGING THE COMMUNITY PLAN RIGHT THE GENERAL PLAN THE CORRECT THE COMMUNITY PLANS AND GET THE GENERAL PLAN REMAINS IN EXISTENCE IT'S SORT OF UPDATED THROUGH THESE COMMUNITY PLANS. SO THE GENERAL PLAN IS JUST THIS DOCUMENT KIND OF LIKE OUR CONSTITUTION WE DON'T DO THE CONSTITUTION WE MAY DO AN AMENDMENT THE LIKE AN AMENDMENT SO THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE AND THE FINAL IN THEIR LAWSUITS OVER.

TEN NINETY TWO THANK YOU SENATOR GORGEOUS GORGEOUS. INSIDE JOKE. TO AND EVERYBODY LATER AB TEN NINETY TWO SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA'S POOREST FAMILIES BY ELIMINATING THE INTEREST ON CHILD SUPPORT THAT -- TO THE STATE. UNDER CURRENT CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM MOST OF MONEY PAID BY LOW INCOME PARENTS DOES NOT GO TO THEIR CHILDREN. ONLY CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA ONLY FIFTY DOLLARS OF A CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT GOES TO THE FAMILY TO SUPPORT THE CHILDREN TO REMAINING BALANCE GO TO PAY BACK TO GOVERNMENT FOR THE FAMILIES PARTICIPATION OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. LIKE HOW IT WORKS WHEN A PARENT FAILS TO MAKE A TIMELY CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT THEIR CREW GOVERNMENT'S DEBT. AND OUR CHARGE 2% INTEREST ONE OF THE HIGHEST CHILD SUPPORT INTEREST IN THE NATION. DATA SHOW THAT THREE POINT NINE BILLION OF THE STATE'S OUTSTANDING CHILD SUPPORT DEBT IS UNPAID INTEREST FURTHERMORE BECAUSE THE DEBT IS OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT LAWS TO PROTECT AGAINST WAGE GARNISHMENT DO NOT APPLY. CHARGING INTEREST ON DEBT -- TO THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOTHING TO BENEFIT FAMILIES THESE POLICIES ACTUALLY RESULT IN LOWERING CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT RATES DRIVING NONCUSTODIAL PARENT TO EXIT THE FORMER ECONOMY TO AVOID WAGE GARNISHMENT. AND DECREASING PARENTS VISIT TO THEIR CHILDREN. AB TEN NINETY TWO WHAT REQUIRE THE STATE TO CHARGE ZERO INTEREST ON CHILD SUPPORT DEBT OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT IN DOING SO THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT MORE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. GO TOWARD SUPPORTING CHILDREN WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS MEASURE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES I WOULD LET THEM INTRODUCE THEMSELVES MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR BY. BOAT. IT LOOKS LIKE I'M SHARING NOW SO YOUR HEAD AND PASS THAT ON HERE THANK YOU. LETTERS SENATORS MY NAME IS THOMAS LAMB SAMA ELECTRICAL MAINTENANCE SUPERVISOR FOR MAJOR FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE I'M A FATHER OF TWO GIRLS ARE JANA WHO IS TEEN RHIANNON WHO IS. pTHEY'VE CHANGED MY LIFE AND I'VE BEEN SUPPORTING AND CARING FOR THEM SINCE BIRTH. EVEN AFTER THE SEPARATION FROM THEIR MOTHER. SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN FINDING FOR CUSTODY AND NOW I HAVE FIFTY FIFTY JOINT LEGAL AND PHYSICAL CUSTODY AND DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS THEY LIVE WITH ME. I WAS BUT INITIALLY PAYING OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR CHILD SUPPORT UNAWARE THAT MOST OF THE MONEY WASN'T MAKING IT TO MY KEYS BUT REPAYING THE GOVERNMENT BACK FOR THE WELFARE. AND CASH AID ASSISTANCE THEIR MOTHER WAS RECEIVING FOR AWHILE. I FELL BEHIND TO THE INTEREST RATES BEING UNREASONABLY HIGH I DIDN'T SEE HOW IT WAS FEASIBLE TO EVER CATCH A I WAS ANGRY AND FEELING LIKE I FEEL MY KIDS BECAUSE THE CHILD SUPPORT COMING FROM MY CHECKS WASN'T ACTUALLY SUPPORTING. MY CHILDREN. THEN I A ROAD IN A PILOT PROGRAM WHERE THEY ELIMINATED THE GOVERNMENT -- DEBT AND ALLOW MY CHILD SUPPORT TO ACTUALLY GET TO MY CHILDREN AND MOTHER. TO HELP THEM AND IT WAS MORE USEFUL I'M GRATEFUL AND I FEEL BLESSED TO BE A PART OF THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ME TO STAY CURRENT ON MY PAYMENTS AND IS CREATING THE FINANCIAL STABILITY. BETWEEN US AS PARENTS TO PROVIDE FOR OUR CHILDREN. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR IS MY NAME IS CRYSTAL BROWN AND I'M WITH THE FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT AND THE SAN FRANCISCO TREASURER'S OFFICE. HE CO AUTHORED A REPORT RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT DESCRIBES THE IMPACT. OF THE REQUIREMENT TO REPAY PUBLIC BENEFITS ON CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME FAMILIES. FOR MANY FAMILIES LIKE THOMAS'S THE CHILDREN ON THE RECEIVE THE FIRST FIFTY DOLLARS OF THE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. AND THE REST IS USED TO REIMBURSE THE COST OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE LIKE MEDICAID ALLEN CAL WORKS. WHEN THEY FALL BEHIND ON PAYMENTS BECAUSE THEIR HOURS CHANGER THEIR TRANSITIONING JOBS? THE DEBT QUICKLY SNOWBALLS WITH FAR WITH 10% INTEREST. MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF CHILD SUPPORT DEBT ACROSS THE STATE IS HELD BY SOMEONE WHO COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEIR ORIGINAL ORDER. IN MANY CASES WHICH WAS TWICE THEIR ANNUAL INCOME. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS DEBT HAS BEEN DEEMED I'M COLLECTIBLE AS IT'S OWNED BY A PARENT WHO OWES WHO EARNS LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN ANNUAL INCOME. I'VE SPOKEN WITH ADULT CHILDREN WHO ARE HELPING THEIR PARENTS PAY OFF THIS PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PAY BACK THAT. AS THEIR PARENTS AGE AND SPOKEN WITH PARENTS WHO CAN'T FIND. HOUSING OR JOBS OR BETTER SITUATIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT THAT THE STATE HAS. ON THEIR CREDIT SCORE IN ON THEIR OVERALL FINANCES. FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE THE STATE TO CHARGE INTEREST ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PAY BACK DEBT AND YET CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST RATE. IS AMONGST THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION A RATE HIGHER THAN TEXAS MISSISSIPPI AND VIRGINIA. OVERALL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT REQUIRING PARENTS TO PAY BACK THE COST OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE DEPRIVE LOW INCOME CHILDREN OF VALUABLE RESOURCES WIDENS THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP AND CREATE CONFLICT IN FAMILIES. CHARGING 10% INTEREST ON TOP OF THIS COMPOUNDS ALL OF THESE ISSUES. AB TEN NINETY TWO WILL PREVENT THAT FROM BALLOONING OVER TIME AND ALLOW MORE RESOURCES TO GO WHERE IT SHOULD WHICH IS TO CHILDREN. THE RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TESTIMONY AND SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES OF SUPPORT -- THAT CAN COME FORWARD.

WONDERFUL AND I WANTED TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE STRINGENT THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT THIS POINT SPEAKS A LOT AND I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CORRECT IN SAYING THAT. THE IMPACT IT HAS ON COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS -- IS A REAL. A GOOD THING SO THANK YOU. I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE BOAT. OKAY AND SO WE HAVE A MOTION FOR A DO PASSED THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS AT THIS POINT. IS THAT IT ALRIGHT AND WE'RE GOOD WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR NOW I NEED TO OKAY AND SHE'LL CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB TO NINETY TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS JACKSON. GORGEOUS BRUSSEL GONZALEZ GONZALEZ. AT GONZALEZ I'D JONES MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN UMBERG UMBERG I'D WHITE HOUSE SKI. OKAY WE HAVE A THREE TWO ZERO VOTE AND WILL HOLD IT OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS JONES SAWYER. YOU. TO GET. TO ALL RIGHT WILL BRING UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER REQUESTS. FOR BY. ONE AND THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN AB. SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. MAKE SIDED -- TO BE HERE AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL -- SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT LEGISLATION RELATED TO OUR STATE ATTORNEY GNERAL AND THE BUREAU OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. AND AS PREVIOUS AS A A PREVIOUS ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL STATED. TOO FREQUENTLY. THIS STATES LOWER INCOME -- THE THE COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR EXPERIENCE FAR GREATER IMPACTS FROM POLLUTION. TOXIC -- CONTENT CONTAMINATION AND YOUR FOOT IN THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING MORE SO THAN WEALTHIER MORE FLUENT AREAS OF THE STATE. AND SO THE US THESE CALIFORNIANS THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED A KEY ROLE OR A VOICE IN THE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIVES. AND SO AS A RESULT THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTY TWENTY THREE IT DOES TWO THINGS. THE FIRST IS IT WOULD ADD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DOJ'S BUREAU VINYL JUSTICE TO THE LIST OF AGENCIES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. MUST COORDINATE WITH REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS. AND THE SECOND THING IS THIS BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN THE DEFINITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO SURE THAT -- COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT OCCURS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT IMPACTED LOCALITIES AND THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE A RIGHT TO BE NOTIFIED. AND INCLUDED WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL PLANNING -- THAT MAY AFFECT THEIR HEALTH AND LIVELIHOODS AND SO CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE ENVIRONMENT DOES APPEAR TO BE CONSULTED AND TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE WITH -- OUR STATE'S CORN AB AGENCY FROM FINAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS -- IT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S A BIG DEAL AND I STRONGLY. BELIEVE THAT THEIR INVOLVEMENT WILL RESULT IN EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. AND BETTER OUTCOMES MAYBE NOT FOR EVERY DISTRICT OR THE CONSTITUENCY THAT WE SERVE IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. BUT IT ABSOLUTELY WILL FOR THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT AND IT ABSOLUTELY WILL FOR THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS -- WHO LIVE ON THE FRONT LINES OF SOME OF THE MOST -- THE POLLUTED AREAS IN OUR STATE. I AND SO CERTAINLY -- I HAVE THE BILL SPONSORS HERE WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO OME SELVES BUT CERTAINLY -- AND RESPECT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS CHELSEA TO I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN ENVIRONMENT. HE IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT CLP WHERE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY INCLUDING KERN AND TULARE COUNTIES. RESIDENTS IN THE VALLEY PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SUFFER FROM SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THE LIVE NEXT TO AND ARE CONSTANTLY EXPOSED TO TOXIC PESTICIDES AND THOUSANDS OF ACTIVE OIL AND GAS WELLS. AND SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE NATION FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS YOUR PC HAS WORKED WITH THESE COMMUNITIES TO REDUCE THE DISPROPORTIONATE POLLUTION AND SOCIO ECONOMIC BURDENS. BUT THESE COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE ON A DAILY BASIS AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE PROUD TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS IN SUPPORT OF AB. SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN AB SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT BUT FOSTER FURTHER COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BUREAU TO ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. WE ARE ENCOURAGED AGENCIES ARE CONTINUING TO PRIORITIZE AND WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH OF THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. FURTHER MORE THIS BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN THE DEFINITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SO THAT IT WOULD EMBODY THE KEY PRINCIPLE THAT FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES SHOULD NOT ONLY BE IN THE ROOM BUT MUST ALSO BE ACTIVE PARTNERS IN MAKING DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE HEALTH OF THEIR FAMILIES. MOST IMPORTANTLY AGED COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DOORS TOXIC BURNS THE STATEFOR TOO LONG. AB SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT RECOGNIZES AND PROMOTES THE ALTMAN GOAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO PREVENT REDUCE AND ELIMINATE POLLUTION BURDENS IN THE MOST POLLUTED COMMUNITIES. IN SOME AB SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT THAT'S THE NECESSARY GOLD STANDARD FOR ACHIEVING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SO THAT EVERY FAMILY IN CALIFORNIA CAN ENJOY A CLEAN AIR WATER IN THE END. WE LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO VOTE I IN THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS SIR CHRISTY WITH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION -- BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE COAST LACK WAS ACTUALLY AMENDED TO SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN ITS PERMIT DECISIONS. THE COMMISSION SUPPORTED THAT POLICY CHANGE BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHERE PROJECTS HAVE COME BEFORE THE COASTAL COMMISSION THAT. OF ESSENTIALLY MEET ALL THE COSTA LACK REQUIREMENTS BUT STILL VISIT AN UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF HARM -- ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BEYOND COASTAL ACT ISSUES SO -- BACK IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE INTRODUCED AB TWENTY SIX SIXTEEN TO OF SORT OF OF CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE IF YOU WILL IS TO SPECIFICALLY SAY THAT YES. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROVISIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE DO APPLY TO THE CONSOLE ACOSTA LACK IN THE COMMISSION CAN USE. THAT DEFINITION TO CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN ITS PERMIT DECISIONS -- THE AGENCY WAS ACTUALLY SO ENTHUSIASTIC TO GET THAT POLICY ARE IMPLEMENTED THAT WE SORT OF JUMPED THE GUN A LITTLE BIT AND TOOK A POLICY TO THE COMMISSION IN. MARCH OF THAT YEAR -- OF OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONCE IT WAS ENACTED. AND BECAUSE WE WANTED TO GO TO GET STARTED AND WE WERE. TOLD CANTLEY BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY THAT THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY HOW AN AGENCY SHOULD PREPARED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICY WE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE ENGAGING THE COMMUNITIES THERE COULD BE AFFECTED. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A ROLL OF MEANINGFUL ROLE TO PLAY IN THE SHAPING OF THAT POLICY. SO WE TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND WE STEP BACK AND WE SPENT THE NEXT TWO YEARS REACHING OUT DIRECTLY. TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COASTAL ZONE MEETING WITH THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AT THEIR REQUEST -- EXPLAINING TO THEM AT AND IS ABOUT THE ABOUT THE COASTAL ACT AND THE POLICY IN HEARING FROM THEM BUT WHAT WOULD BE MEANINGFUL FOR THEM AND WHAT THEY REALLY NEED TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO DO BETTER AND DIFFERENTLY. TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. GOING FORWARD AND SO I'M VERY APPY TO SAY THAT THAT EFFORT RESULTED IN THE COMMISSION ADOPTING A MUCH STRONGER POLICY IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR. AND THAT'S WHY THE ITEMS ARE TO SUPPORTING THE BILL WE CAN JUST WRAP UP GREAT. MEANING FULL -- INVOLVEMENT WITH COMMUNITIES IS ESSENTIAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION THE COMMISSION UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTS THIS BILL AND WE HOPE YOU DO TOO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU.
