I REPRESENT THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH AND- LOS ANGELES THE TWO LARGEST PORTS IN THE NATION. JUST AS THESE PORTS ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMY IN THE LOS ANGELES REGION. ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S PORTS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC SUCCESS. AND OUR RECOVERY FROM THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIA PORTS HANDLE 40% OF CONTAINERIZED IMPORTS AND 30% OF ALL EXPORTS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WITH SUCH A MASSIVE VOLUME OF CARGO COMING THROUGH OUR PORTS THEY SERVE AS A MAJOR DRIVER OF GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR OUR STATE. MORE THAN ONE MILLION JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AND THREE MILLION JOBS NATIONWIDE ARE LINKED TO TRADE COMING THROUGH. OUR PORTS. I LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE IS A PORT IN EVERY DISTRICT IS IMPORTANT LEGISLATORS REALIZE HOW MUCH OF WHAT GOES ON AT OUR PORTS DIRECTLY. IMPACTS THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE ELEVEN PORTS IN THE STATE THE TWO BIGGEST ARE MY DISTRICT BUT BY NO MEANS DOES THAT NOT MEAN THE OTHERS ARE BORN THEY ALL SERVE A VITAL FUNCTION. FOR THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND BEYOND. OVER THE PAST YEAR. IS BECOME APPARENT MORE MORE THAN EVER AS CALIFORNIA PORTUGAL'S MOON WORKERS HAVE SHOWN GREAT RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY AND UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC.

DISCUSSED ENOUGH. THIS HEARING WILL PROVIDE MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE HOW THE PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED THEIR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS. AND HOW THEY HAVE RESPONDED. BEYOND THEIR ECONOMIC IMPACT CALIFORNIA PORTS ARE ALSO LEADING THE WORLD IN ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION. IF THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT GOING GREEN OR SOMETHING OF ARMALITE SURE YOU. IT'S HAPPENING AT LEAST AT THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH. AND LA OVER THE PAST DECADE THE PORTS AND GOODS MOVEMENT INDUSTRY IS HELP TO ACHIEVE MAJOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. BUT OUR WORK ISN'T DONE YET WE STILL NEED TO FIND A PATH TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS. EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS. THAT IS WHY. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT STATE LATER STATE LEADERS WORK TOGETHER WITH THE INDUSTRY TO CRAFT WORKABLE REGULATIONS. AND DELIVER RESOURCES THAT CAN HELP THEM MAKE THEM TRANSITION TO AN EVEN GREENER OPERATE TO EVEN GREENER OPERATIONS. OVER THE NEXT DECADE I WOULD SAY THE FORCED ME TO MAKE GREEN TO GO GREEN.

OF THE FIFTH THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED GROWTH AND PROSPERITY IS TIED TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND ITS PARTS ARE THE LINCHPIN OF ITS FREE INTERNATIONAL TRADE SYSTEM PORTS ARE CALIFORNIA'S DE FACTO TRADE STRATEGY CAPITAL PORT SERVE AS BOTH THE STATE AND NATION'S GATEWAY TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY COMBINED WE COMPRISE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF COURTS IN THE NATION MORE THAN 40% OF THE TOTAL CONTAINERIZED CARGO ENTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALMOST FLOW THROUGH THE PORTS IN THE GOLDEN STATE. THE CARGO FLOWING THROUGH CALIFORNIA PARTS ACCOUNTS FOR OVER NINE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS NATIONALLY AND OVER FIVE MILLION JOBS NATIONALLY AS THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC BEGAN THERE WAS WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT A PORT SHUTDOWN WAS IMMINENT RESULTING AND CUT THE CONSUMER PANIC BUYING OF EVERYDAY GETS CALIFORNIANS PARTS REMAINS CLEAR WE NEED TO KEEP CARGO LIVING FOR ITS PART THE PART OF LOS ANGELES WORK TO ENSURE PORT OPERATIONS CONTINUED UNABATED THIS INCLUDED WORKING WITH STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE THAT EMERGENCY ORDERS RECOGNIZE WORKERS. ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS THE FEDERAL. THE SAN PEDRO PARK COME. BEGAN TO ENTER MEASURES TO PREVENT AND REDUCE THE RISK OF SPREAD OF THE PIVOT NINETEEN VIRUS. THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE AND WAREHOUSE UNION MODIFIED THERE DISPATCHING PRACTICES AND WORK WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES REPRESENTED BY THE PACIFIC MARITIME ASSOCIATION. TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS TO CLEAN EQUIPMENT BETWEEN CHEFS. DESPITE THE NEW CLEANING PROTOCOLS SEVERAL PARTS FACED A SHORTAGE OF CLEANING SUPPLIES AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. INDIVIDUAL PARTS STEPPED UP. AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DANNY WANTED HIS TEAM HELP THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS DISEMBARK THE GRANDPARENTS FAST AND MAKE THEIR WAY TO QUARANTINE SOUNDS. THE PORT OF LONG BEACH THE PORT WHY NINI AND OTHER KAPPA MEMBERS- OPEN TESTING SITES FOR WATER FOR WORKERS. THE PART OF LOS ANGELES SERVED AS THE HOME FOR THAT U. S. SENATE AFTER PERCY WHICH WAS DISPATCHED A SANDAL IS DURING THE FIRST EXPECTED. SURGE OF QUEBEC NINETEEN PATIENTS. DESPITE THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF KAPPA MEMBERS PARTS HAVE NOT BEEN IMMUNE TO THE WORST IMPACTS OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC YOU'LL HEAR FROM MANY OF THEM TODAY ON THE SPECIFIC IMPACT THAT THEY'RE FACING. LOS ANGELES LONG BEACH IN OAKLAND THE THREE LARGEST CONTAINER PORTS IN THE STATE EXPERIENCED HUGE SHOCK TO THE GLOBAL TRADE. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC BECAUSE ONE OF THE MOST EROTIC AND VOLATILE YEARS IN TERMS OF CONTAINER VOLUMES. IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY CHINA'S BATTLE AGAINST THE PANDEMIC CAUSED A HALL IN FACTORY PRODUCTION FOLLOWED BY CANCELED SAILINGS AND THEN A DROP IN U. S. CONSUMER ACTIVITY AS AMERICA SHUT DOWN ITS ECONOMY. AS A RESULT VOLUMES PLUMMET BY 90% IN THE FIRST HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY. IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AS CHINESE MANUFACTURING RESUMES AND U. S. RETAILERS STARTED TO REPLENISH THEIR DEPLETED INVENTORIES CONSUMER DEMAND REBOUNDED CAUSING AN UNPRECEDENTED IMPORT SEARCH. WHICH NEARLY MADE OUT FOR THE EARLIER VOLUME DECLINED. THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ALSO CAUSED AND OBSERVE SHIFTED BUYING PATTERNS FROM SERVICES TO GET WHICH MANIFESTED IN AN IMPORT SURGE THAT HAS STRAINED THE OVERALL SUPPLY CHAIN. APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF ALL CONTAINERIZED CARGO IS TRUCKED TO REGIONAL WAREHOUSES DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO ONE OF THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF WAREHOUSES IN THE WORLD. APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION SQUARE FEET IN THE REGION IN. THE WAREHOUSES ARE FULL SIMPLY. PUT THERE IS NO WHERE TO PUT THE CARGO. AS A RESULT. ARE LEFT AT THE MARINE TERMINAL LEADING TO A STEADY BACKUP OF SHIPS AT THE SAN PEDRO BAY PARK COMPLEX. AT THIS COMPLEX VESSELS AT ANCHOR WAITING UP TO TWO WEEKS BEFORE RECEIVING AN OPETH ASSIGNMENT TO BE UNLOADED. AS A RESULT TO EASE CONGESTION BLANK SAILINGS ARE ANTICIPATED FOR MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WELL HISTORICALLY THERE IS A DECLINE IN CHINESE FACTORY PRODUCTION DUE TO LUNAR NEW YEAR WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THIS WILL CREATE ANY RISK BY. REGULAR VESSEL TRAFFIC SHOULD BE RETURNED BY JUNE OR JULY OF THIS YEAR. ANOTHER IMPACT OF IMPACT OF MAXED OUT WAREHOUSE CAPACITY AT THAT CARGO OWNERS HAVE RESORTED TO USING CONTAINERS AS WAREHOUSES. IN NORMAL TIMES WHEN IMPORT CONTAINERS PICKED UP AT THE PORT IT TAKES THREE DAYS FOR THAT CONTAINER TO BE DEMANDS. AND RETURN TO THE POOR AT THE EMPTY CONTAINER. PRESENTLY THE CYCLE IS TAKING TEN DAYS AS A RESULT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF CONTAINERS. THE SHORTAGE OF CONTAINERS HAS NOT GONNA FAX FIRST CARRIERS HAVE MADE A BUSINESS DECISION TO CYCLE THE EMPTIES BACK TO ASIA IN ORDER TO PICK UP THE NEXT ROUND OF IMPORTS RATHER THAN ALLOW THAT CONTAINER TO BE LOADED WITH EXPORTS. THIS BUSINESS DECISION IS DRIVEN BY THE CURRENT PRICE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN IMPORT LOADS VERSUS EXPERT LET'S THIS DECISION HAS IMPACTED EXPORTERS ACROSS THE US. THE SURGEON CARGO HAPPENED AT A TIME WHEN OUR WORKFORCE HAS BEEN SEEING A SURGE IN COVERT CASES. FROM MARCH TO DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE REPORTED CASES OF KOBE ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA LONG SHORT WORKERS. IN THE FIRST SIX WEEKS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN NEW CASE THAT'S- CURRENTLY ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED LONG SURE WORKERS ARE NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF COMBAT. CALIFORNIA PORTS ARE IN NEED OF RELIEF WHETHER IN THE FORM OF PRIORITIZE ACCESS TO VACCINE OR IN THE FORM OF RELIEF FINDING. PARTS HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER IN EVERY CALVET RELIEF PACKAGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. TOGETHER WE MUST ADVOCATE FOR FULL FUNDING OF THE MARITIME TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM OUR MERCHANTS THE RELIEF PROGRAM. TO SUPPORT PARTS AND THEIR TENANTS. I SECURING RELIEF WE CAN ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S PARTS ARE THERE FOR THE STATE AS PARTNERS IN RECOVERY. AS OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED PARTS ARE ECONOMIC ASSETS THAT CAN BE HARNESSED TO DRIVE ECONOMIC RESURGENCE. CALIFORNIA'S PORTS SERVE AS GATEWAYS CONNECTING EVERY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY TO MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. AS PARTS WE NEED A LINE POLICY PLANNING AND PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL OF THESE AREAS TRANSPORTATION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WE SEE IT HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES AND WE NEED TO DEVELOP A SIMILAR STRATEGY RIGHT HERE WE SEE THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S FORM SHOULD BE A TRUE TRADE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY FOR CALIFORNIA. THE HARNESSES THE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES AND COMMERCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EVERYONE OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC PARTS. LASTLY WE CANNOT FORGET THAT CALIFORNIA PORT COMPETITIVENESS MUST COMPLEMENT AND BALANCE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP. ENSURING CARGO AND PASSENGERS ARE NOT DIVERTED TO DIRTY AIR MORE CARBON INTENSIVE GATEWAYS AS SMART POLICY. NO PORTS AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE MATCH THE INVESTMENTS THE CALIFORNIA PARTS ON THEIR TENANTS HAVE MADE IN REDUCING CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND GREENHOUSE GASES. SETTING ASIDE THE CLEANER ACTION PLANS THAT MANY OF THE PARTS HAVE ADOPTED INCLUDING SAN PEDRO BAY PORTS WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND GREENHOUSE GASES. CALIFORNIA PARTS ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY DOLLARS MANY OF THEM WILL SHARE THEIR INDIVIDUAL SUCCESS STORIES OF THE BUYER MINISTER CHIP WITH YOU TODAY AS PART OF THE PANEL. WORKINGWITH YOU WE SEEK TO BUILD TOWARDS OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS WHILE CONTINUING TO PURSUE TRADE COMPETITIVENESS AND WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES. THIS RENEWED AND REDEFINED PARTNERSHIP. IS THE SUMMONS UP OF OUR MESSAGE TO OUR LEADERS IN SACRAMENTO. TODAY WE LOOK FORWARD TO DEVELOPING THESE IDEAS WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF THANK YOU. THANK YOUARE MARTHA MILLER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PORTS ASSOCIATION. AND I THINK ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS YOU SPOKE ABOUT MOST PEOPLE IN RECOGNIZE UNLESS YOU'RE FROM THE AREA THERE ARE MORE SHIPS. OUT ON THE- ON THE ON THE ON AND OFF THE BEACH IN LONG BEACH AND PROBABLY I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE- THE OTHER AFFLUENT FIVE FORTY TO FORTY FIVE SHIPS ANCHORED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HUNTINGTON BEACH. BECAUSE THE BACKUP IS AS SIGNIFICANT BACK UP- BECAUSE AS SHE STATED THE WAREHOUSES ARE FULL THE DOCKS ARE FULL SO THESE FOLKS ARE WAITING- TO UNLOAD. THEIR CARGO FOR VARIETY REASONS AND THE CHINESE YOU KNEW YOUR PLACE IN THEIR LITTLE BIT COVERT PLACE AND THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT- AND- KIND OF THE BACKLOG I ASSUME PLACE BACK PLACE AND A LITTLE BIT TOO. SO LET'S MOVE ON OUR PANEL AND OF THE PANELS COULD PLEASE STICK TO THEIR- THEIR GIVEN- BUT WE GAVE THEM- IN A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME- BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT STE A SIMILAR AGUILAR CREE HAS. SOMETHING SHE WANTS TO SAY. THANK YOU ARE. YOUR YOUR- PRESENT- YOU JUST SAID. THAT I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING. THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY RELIEF UNTIL JUNE OR JULY- WHAT ARE THE INDICATORS TO TELL. THAT WE WOULD KNOW THAT WE WOULD. BE ABLE TO GET OUR- OUR PRODUCT OUT BY JUNE OR JULY IS THERE'S A SOME INDICATORS THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF- I'M FROM THE ARAB WORLD AND WE ARE JUST. REALLY STRETCHING IT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF US IMPORTS COMING IN BUT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO EXPORTER STUFF OUT SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE US SOME IDEA. SO WE WOULD HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE THAT THAT WOULD BE GENERAL JULY WHICH I'M HOPING IT'S SOONER BUT.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT BONNELL- CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN WE CAN SEE IT TOO GOOD JOB. ALL RIGHT. TRYING TO FIGURE FIGURE OUT THE A WEBEX- SO I GOT ON SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION TO THE PORTS- AND THAT BECAUSE AS YOU HEARD WE ARE IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY AS WELL AS TO MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND ALSO EMERGENCY SERVICES AND AS THE CALL THE PRICES WILL POINT OUT AND I WOULD DRESS HERE- FIRST OF ALL ABOUT THE PORT OF OAKLAND. WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST CONTAINER PORT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND HOWEVER WERE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE IN THAT THE PORT OF OAKLAND ALSO RUNS THE OAKLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. AS WELL AS WE- MANAGED NINETEEN MILES THE OAKLAND WATERFRONT. TOGETHER WITH OUR- LINES OF BUSINESS WE REPRESENT ABOUT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE WE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FOR ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE FIVE THOUSAND JOBS IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION. AS WELL AS IN OUR SEAPORT WE ARE- VERY MUCH A EXPORT PORTAL. FOR MUCH OF THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FUND CENTRAL VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA- ALSO WE ARE UNIQUE IN THAT YOUR SUPPORT IS UNIQUE IN THAT WE ARE ABOUT 50% IMPORT AND 50% EXPORT. WHERE IS OUR COLLEAGUES DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE- I WOULD SAY MOSTLY- IMPORTS SO WE ARE PROBLEMS THAT- WE ARE VERY CLOSE CUT TALK CONTACT WITH THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS WHETHER- A LOT OF IT BUSINESSES THAT MAX OUT YOUR GOODS IN THE CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE TELLS LAW HAS ITS PLANT IN FREMONT AND YOUR PORTABLE OAKLAND AND THAT THAT WAS A ONE OF OUR- THEY ABOUT BIG BUSINESS PARTNERS THEIR SHIPS OUT OF PORT OF OAKLAND EXPORTS. SO IT IS A THEREFORE DEPLORABLE CRIMES TRIAL POSITION B. THE PORTAL BUT MIKE TO A BUSINESS A. SHIP'S DATA DOES BUSINESS ASIA. ARE TODAY THEME IS A- VISIT IN ACTION. BOSTON TRIES- I THINK- IT IS FOR TO SAY THAT THE WITH TEST. ALL OF US. AND- MAKE SURE THE SHOWS. THAT WOULD YOU KNOW THE GOAL GETS TOP TOUGH GET GOING AND THAT ALSO SHOWS HOW WELL WE CAN DO BUT ALSO SHOWS SOME WEAKNESS IS BEING OUR OPERATIONS HI THIS THIS TIME THAT WHEN THE PEOPLE MOST REPAIRED AND IT DID NOT WORK SO THE MOST UP TO BROWN RUNNING. SHOWS IT'S A ABILITY TO HANDLE THE PRICES. ARE FOR ME AND FOR THE PORT OF OAKLAND FOR THE EMPLOYEES OF THE PORT THE CALL THE CRISIS HIT US- WENT WITH THE GRAPHIC PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP PULLED UP AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND WE REALIZED THAT THAT WAS EVEN THAT WAS A TIE IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR. WHEN PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY QUITE KNOW WHAT THIS COAT COVERT VIRUS WAS THERE WAS A LOT OF FEAR. I IN TERMS OF PEOPLE GETTING OFF THE CRUISE SHIP WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO ARE THEY GONNA TRANSIT VIRUS AND POWER GOING TO IT THESE PEOPLE TO HOW MUCH CORENTIN DO WE NEED SO BUT NONETHELESS THE PORTABLE BECAUSE STEPPED UP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- FACILITATES THE FACILITATOR SACRAMENTO AND RELIEF EFFORTS. TO DISEMBARK THE PASSENGERS AND HELP PROVIDE MEDICAL SCREENING. ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE COMING ASHORE. I THINK IS A- IN ADDITION TO THE SEAPORT- EMPTY THE- COULD. OUT OF THE WAY- MAKING SURE P. ARE ABLE TO GET OFF THE BOAT AND SHIP ONTO THE GROUND BECAUSE THE PORT OF OAKLAND IS NOT A CRUISE SHIP TERMINAL. THERE REALLY IS NO STAIRS OR STEPS FOR PEOPLE TO GET OFF SHIPS- TO THE SEAPORT NOW AS WE SET UP IN WITHIN THE SPACE OF TWO DAYS- BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT BUT PROBABLY LESS RECOGNIZED WAS THE RANA PLAZA EFFORT OF OUR- AVIATION STAFF AT THE OAKLAND. AIRPORT WHO DIRECTED TO TRANSPORT PASSENGERS INCLUDE THROUGHOUT THE AIRPORT IN ORDER TO GET THEM HOME TO LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAN AROUND THE ORLD. IT WAS NO SMALL DOING. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD FLIGHTS- THAT ARE NOT SCHEDULED. TO COORDINATE WITH THE DISEMBARKATION OF THE PASSENGERS OFF THE CRUISE SHIP IN ORDER TO FLY THEM HOME. TO VARIOUS PLACES- WHETHER THEY NEED TO BE POINTING WHEN THEY GET THERE OR NOT AND A- LOT OF THE CREW HAD TO BE FLOWN BACK TO ASIA- SO THERE WAS A LOT OF- BOTH CAPACITORS. LANDING CALIFORNIA AROUNDTHE UNITED STATES. BUT AS WELL AS AROUND THE WORLD. I THINK THE COUPLE OF HOURS ALSO. US IN TURN OR MERGE WHICH- TO BE. FOR OUR- AS WELL- THE PORT OF OAKLAND BECAUSE OF ITS CONNECTIONS IT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TO PLY CHIANG. WERE ABLE TO IS. SECURE ON MASKS. AS YOU REMEMBER BACK IN MARCH- MASKS WASN'T WEARING SHORT SUPPLY. ND SO WE WERE ABLE TO GO THROUGH OUR NETWORK TO GET MASKS NOT ONLY FOR ALL EMPLOYEES. OF FOR OUR FOLKS TO WORKING OUT OF THE LONG SHORT A SECTOR AS WELL AS THAT PEOPLE WORKING. AROUND THE CHAD LOGISTICS CHAIN. I THINK IS. DAMAGE IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PORTS THE INVITATION TO IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCE AS WELL AS TO- TO THE JOBS. THAT WE ARE A ESSENTIAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE FACILITY. AS WE DEMONSTRATED. NOW THAT THAT'S MOVE ON TO- IN TERMS OF THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS THE CARGO I'VE HEARD MUCH ABOUT LOS ANGELES LONG BEACH THE CONGESTION THAT'S HAPPENING THERE. ARE WE ARE HAPPY THAT THE PORT OF OAKLAND IS ABLE TO- STEP AGAIN STEP UP AGAIN TO RELIEVE SOME OF THAT PRESSURE IN ITS SUPPLY HAIN. I WANTED IT- SORT OF THREE TO PANDEMIC BOB THIS IS THAT IS BEING REVEALED ITSELF IS THAT A LOT OF THEIR SHIPMENTS OF GOODS SOMETIMES POST ON THE SHIP ASIA BOSU LOS ANGELES LONG BEACH FIRST AS THE FIRST PORT OF CALL AND THEY UNLOAD THEIR CARGO THERE AND THEY DO COME BACK TO OAKLAND AS A SECOND PORT OF CALL IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THIS THE GOODS THERE ARE DESTINED FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO NEVADA IN ENGLAND TO- I HAVEN'T. TO- TO INTERN IN THE DESTINEE TO RAIL. AND ALSO THE EXPORTERS THEN GET TO. LOAD THEIR CARGO DESTINED FOR ASIA. HOWEVER WHAT'S HAPPENED HOWEVER IS THAT SINCE THERE'S CONGESTION LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES- THESE FOLKS WHO ARE WAITING TO EAT. LOADED UNLOAD THEIR GOODS IN OAKLAND HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE TIMES THAT ARE DIG BEING DETAINED IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PORTS IN ORDER TO MAKE THE SECOND PORT OF CALL. IN OAKLAND. I THINK THE REALIZATION AND- DO THIS CRISIS. IS THAT HEY THAT DOESN'T QUITE MAKE SENSE IN ORDER TO RELIEVE THE CONGESTION OAKLAND. WHY DON'T SOMEBODY SHIP SIMPLY COME TO OPEN FIRST AS THE FIRST PORT OF CALL IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE EXPORT GOODS ARE WAITING AT THE PORT. OF OAKLAND AND ALSO TO. OFFLOAD GOODS THAT THE FOLKS KNOW CONSUMERS ARE WAITING FOR IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO INDEED- THIS. JUST THIS MONTH. WHAT ARE THE SHIPPING LINES ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL BE MAKING A FIRST PORT OF CALL TO THE PORTABLE CLICKED. NOW THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM PUBLIC TRUST PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE SECOND AS YOU REALIZE THE LOGISTICS CHANGE NOT SHIPS WAS ALSO TRUCKS TRAINS AND BEING ABLE TO GET THESE GOODS IN AND OUT OF THE GOOD PARTS QUICKLY- THAT IS ALSO CAUSING SOME CONGESTION AS WELL. AND THEREFORE I THINK ARE REAL BILL TO STEP UP IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THOSE GOODS AND SHIPPED THEM INTO THE INLAND DESTINATIONS AND WAREHOUSES ARE AVAILABLE BOTH AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND IN NORFOLK CALIFORNIA DESTINATIONS AS TRACY. SO I THINK WHAT THIS IS REVEALED HOWEVER. IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A COORDINATED APPROACH. TO PLAN FOR GOODS MOVEMENT AND THEY JUST PICKED IN CALIFORNIA- THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT NOW IS THAT THE FOR THE FOR THE OPERATING FAIRLY INDEPENDENTLY. AND IS SOMETIMES WERE IN COMPETITION SOMETIMES WE COOPERATE BUT THESE LOGISTIC CHAINS ARE AT THE MERCY OF WORSHIPS CHOOSE THE GOAL AND WHERE DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE FASTEST. THEREFORE I THINK THIS CRISIS REVEALED IS THAT WE DO NEED A CALIFORNIA PORTS PLAN LOGISTICS PLAN TO MAKE SURE THE GOODS FLOW WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. THE MOST EFFICIENTLY RATHER THAN WAIT FOR SIMPLY A CRISIS THAT HAPPENED TO SHOW IT TO US. AT AND THAT IS THAT SORT OF THE LESSONS THAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM HERE AND ALSO YOU WILL HEAR THAT PROBABLY FROM THE TESTIMONY FROM- LATER SPEAKERS. THAT THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN THE FACILITIES THE PORTS LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE FORTUNES OF THE IT EACH INDIVIDUAL PORTS. WE DON'T GET TAX DOLLARS WERE OPERATIONS WE SCAN PEOPLE GRANTS FIRST FACILITIES FROM THE STATE BUT MOST OF OUR INCOME INVESTMENTS I MADE FOR THE BUSINESSES THAT WE MAKE. I THAT IS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE YOU FEEL COULD GO AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE COMPETITORS THAT THAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA OUR PORTS IN EAST COAST AND SOUTH COAST VIRGINIA GEORGIA AND HOUSTON TEXAS THE WALLS IN CANADA IN VANCOUVER BRITISH COLUMBIA. OUR SHARE OF THE MARKET IN THE WORLD TODAY IN THE UNITED STATES CARGO HAS DROPPED FROM OVER 50% TO DOWN TO NOW 40% WHY BECAUSE THESE OTHER PORTS ARE COMPETING BETTER THAN WE ARE IN TERMS OF RECEIVING CARGO. PART OF THE REASON YOU'LL SEE. AS YOU LOOK INTO THE NUMBERS IS THAT THE STATE'S IN THOSE OTHER STATES THE STATE GOVERNMENT IN THOSE OTHER STATE PORTS SUPPORT. AND INVEST HEAVILY INTO THE PORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DISK CHAINS ARE COORDINATED STATEWIDE THE INVESTMENT VERY MADE A STATEWIDE FASHION. I AM ADVOCATING AND I THINK YOU WILL HEAR FROM OTHERS AT THE STATE. AND WE APPRECIATE THIS THIS THIS- THIS HEARING IS A GOOD START TO GET THE STATE TO THINK ABOUT A STATEWIDE COORDINATED EFFORT BOTH IN TERMS OF LOGISTICS EFFICIENCY AND IN TERMS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENT ARE YOU HERE FOR A LATER PANEL. I'LL STOP THERE AND I REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M OPEN TO QUESTIONS I GUESS IF THERE'S ANY. THANK YOU MR ONE WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO ORIGINAL MICHELIN I BELIEVE SHE'S ON THE PHONE SHE IS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION RACHEL. I CAN HEAR YOU. I DON'T. HEARING ROOMS. THANK YOU TO HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU. ARE YOU GUYS SORRY THANK YOU IS IT JUST KIND OF OUR PROGRAMS BROWN THE REALITY IS THAT I AM WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING CHAIRED THE MEMBERS. THANK YOU LIVE OUR LIVES IN A PRE INDUSTRIAL MANNER WE DON'T GROW OUR OWN. BAKER I'M CLOSE PROVIDER OF MEDICAL CURES WE ALL DEPEND ON A WELL BACKED UP BY CHIANG TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE PRODUCT DELIVERY TRUCK YOU NEED TO BE. SICK IF THEY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT DURING THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. BUT WHY CHALLENGES THEIR BUSINESSES FACE IN TERMS OF OUR SUPPLY. CHAIN THAT GREW DURING PROGRAM. NUMBER ONE I'M CERTAIN. SAID HATES CENTER. AND CO. OVER ABOUT A THIRD KEY DROUGHT THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THE ENTIRE. EFFORTS IS UNDER STRESS. AND BECAUSE OF THE CODE NINE CLASS. IT'S BEEN. ISSUE ENTIRE. THAT WAS TIME FOR PARTICIPANTS THE SUPPLY CHAIN TOGETHER HELLO. SHOPPERS EFFICIENCY. OUR STRATEGY SHOULD FOCUS ON FUTURE. SUNDAY WE NEED PASSED NAY. I'VE CHANGING WALDRON TO BUILD. WHAT COMPLY WITH PUT FORTH BY AND APPOINTED LEADERS. BECOME EVEN MORE CHALLENGING AT THE LACK OF A APPOINTED HAVE PASSED NEW RIGHT THAT NAME OF KOBE MOST. IS THE ORDER AND THEN YOU CAN CON CONTRADICTED JOHN AS A VERY REGULAR BODY YOU'RE NOT WITH OTHER AGENCIES MAKING IT CLOSE TO IMPOSSIBLE FOR BUSINESSES TO COMPLY IN CALIFORNIA'S COMPLEX. REGULATORY OPEN BACK. BACKING WE KNOW THE KEY TO GETTING HOW THE BACK ON TRACK IS A QUICK. AND AFTER BACK OUT THAT INCLUDES OUR SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS CALIFORNIA RETAILERS STRONGLY SUPPORT AN EXPECTED. PLANT THE STATE GUARD THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS NOT DISTRACTED DUE TO KOBE. CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN IS CO DEPENDENT WE NEED EVERY PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN STRONG AND HEALTHY TO ENSURE WE CAN COMPLETE CALLED LOCALLY. BUT THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE AS THE WORLD PERTAINING TO THE COVERS BACK THREE THREE TO CHANGE DALY. CHERRY RETAIL PHARMACY STAND READY TO ASSIST OUR SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS SHOULD THEY GET ACCESS TO THE VACCINE TO ENSURE THOSE SHOTS ARE GIVEN TO OUR FRONT. LINE SUPPLY CHAIN WORKERS. THESE ARE CATS JOHN. AND RETAILERS YOU X. THE BUDGET BY TO GET WITH THAT ON THEIR OWN WE TO BE A ACTIVE. AND FINING THE WE THAT STABLE CAL THE CHAIN NOW I SOLIDIFY TWO YEARS CURRENT. HOW DO WE DO THAT. BETTER WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE SILOS THAT WE WORK WITH BANK BUSINESS GOVERNMENT AND OUR BY BODY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER UNIK KIDDING FAITH AND FIND STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE ADVICE AND REGULAR BOWL HELLO POLICY LEADERS ASKED TO SOME OF THE WHY MY IN THE WAR LENNIX TO BUT YOU INNOVATION THEY SHOULD USE THAT WE BY BRINGING AND WORK FOR BACK AT YOU REGULATE. AND LIFT TO ALTERNATIVE IDEAS ON HOW TO ACHIEVE GOALS ARE UNITED PLANTER CALIFORNIA'S. CHAIN HELLO IS THE FIFTH LARGEST. BECAUSE OF OUR POOR INTO CHAIN. TAKE THAT AWAY AND- BLUE ITS- STANDING. EXPERIENCE FROM INCOURT INCOME. THE FLIGHT HAS IT'S NOT PRIORITIZE BY A POLICY. AND INSTEAD OF PROVIDING INFECTION AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE ON THE WORLD STAGE EIGHT FIVE ARTICLES IN THE WAY THAT GAMBHIR INNOVATION AND PUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COURT SYSTEM IN JEOPARDY. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN WE NEED TO DO BETTER BETTER FAR SUPPLY CHAIN.

THANK YOU MISTER INTO YOU FOR THE ASK THAT WE- INSURE THE BEST HAS A VOICE IN THE PROCESS BE REGULATORY OR OTHERWISE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE- THAT POINT WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO ELAINE FORMS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO ELAINE FORBES. MORNING JOURNAL CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS WEEKEND THANK YOU UP EXCELLENT THANK YOU SO MUCH JOURNAL MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE I MEANING WORKS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON HOW COLD IT HAS IMPACTED THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO THE PORT MANN JUST SEVEN AND A HALF MILES OF THE FRONTRUNNER LINE FROM FISHERMAN'S WHARF TO HERON'S HEAD PARK. AND WE HOST SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VISITOR SERVING RESOURCES IN THE BAY AREA WE SUPPORT MARITIME COMMERCE WE MAINTAIN OPEN SPACES AND PARKS ACCESS TO THE BAY AND IMPORTANTLY WE LEASE OUR SPACES TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED BUSINESSES THAT WELCOME COUNTLESS VISITORS. LOCALLY REGIONALLY AND FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THIS ALL CONTRIBUTES TO THE ECONOMY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND OF COURSE TO OUR STATE ECONOMY. WE ALSO WORK TO ADVANCE PUBLIC PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIPS ON SURPLUS PORT LANDS TO BUILD MORE NEW NEIGHBORHOODS- THAT SUPPORT OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE AFFORDABILITY. DIVERSITY AND OTHER IMPORTANT GOALS FOR OUR LANDS. NOW TO WHAT CO THAT HAS MANAGED TO THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT GOODS MOVEMENT TODAY AND I'M GOING TO SPEAK IS A BOUTIQUE PORT IS MORE IN THE BUSINESS OF PASSENGER MOVING- AND SHARE SIMILARITIES WITH PORT OF SAN DIEGO AND SOME OF THE OTHER. SPORTS ALONG THE STATE. WE HAVE MANY FACILITIES IN TENANTS THAT ARE CLOSED OR NEARLY CLOSED TO THE PANDEMIC AND THE HEALTH WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO KEEP. OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. WE HAVE POTENTIALLY VERY PROFOUND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FROM THIS DECLINE IN REVENUE AND FROM THE SHORE- THE SHEDDING. NUMEROUS NUMEROUS FOR BUSINESSES AND TENDENCIES WHICH I'LL DISCUSS IN MY REMARKS TODAY BUT FIRST I WANT TO SPEAK TO RESILIENCE AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT PORTS HAVE PLAYED IN THE COVERT RESPONSE. BECAUSE FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO WHAT. IT MEANT FOR US WAS RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF OUR CITY IN NEED- WE QUICKLY PIVOTED A THIRTEEN ACRE SITE OF OURS PEERS THIRTY THIRTY TWO FROM CONSUMER PARKING. COMMUTER PARKING SORRY- ONTO A TESTING SITE THAT HAS SERVED HIGH VOLUME TESTING THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. WE TRANSFORMED INDUSTRIAL LAYDOWN SPACE AND OUR SOUTHERN WATERFRONT- IN ON OUR MARINE FACILITY I TO SHELTER HOMELESS- IN TRAILERS FROM THE BACK LANDS THOSE MARINE TERMINALS ARE PEERS NINETY FOUR NINETY SIX. WE'VE WELCOMED PP DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE WE HAVE A FOOD PANTRY ON OUR LAND AND WE HAVE DEDICATED THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF PORT STAFF TIME FROM OUR CRAFTS FOR MORE LOGISTICS TEAM PROJECT MANAGERS COMMUNICATIONS EXPERTS REALLY PORT SPECIALTIES. ALL THE WHILE THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS WORKED HARD TO PROTECT OUR PROPERTY AND PROTECT OUR TENANTS THROUGH THIS REALLY UNPRECEDENTED. ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WE ON- A PROSPERITY MODEL WITH OUR TENANTS A SHARED. MY TO HELP OUR CAN WHETHER STORM. THOSE THAT AND CAN BE PROUD. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS PANDEMIC WE'VE OFFERED TEN- RENT RELIEF SPECIFIC RENT RELIEF FOR MARITIME TENANTS. OF FORMER MISSION OF RETAIL TENANTS WHICH ARE CLOSED OR NEARLY CLOSED AND FOR NONPROFIT SMALL BUSINESSES ARTISTS. WITH THE GOAL OF VIBRANCY AND DIVERSITY FIRE WATERFRONT. SO NOW I'M GOING TO TURN TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO IS A AS IT RELATES TO THIS PANDEMIC SO WE ARE SUFFERING. ONE ONCE IN A LIFETIME REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUES WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS TYPE OF REVENUE. I DECLINE- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OR IN ANY OTHER TIME AND THIS IS REALLY ACTIVITY FROM CRUISE RESTAURANT TOURIST ATTRACTIONS AND PARKING WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY DROPPED OFF OR IN SOME CASES STOP ENTIRELY. WE ARE SO HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY AND OUR WATERFRONT IT'S WHERE. WE EXPECT TO RECOVER. RIGHT NOW WE ARE PRETTY. THAT WE DON'T EXPECT A FULL RECOVERY OF TOURISM UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OR PERHAPS BEYOND DEPENDING ON CONSUMER BEHAVIORS AND HOW QUICKLY THIS VIRUS IS- HANDLED AND BEHIND US AS IT RELATES TO VACCINATIONS. ADDITIONAL CARGO ROBEL- AUTOMOTIVE SWITCHES EXPORT HAS BEEN ACTUALLY STRONG AND NOT MUCH HASN'T SEEN MUCH IMPACT FROM THE PANDEMIC LUCKILY FOR US- BUT BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS OUR REVENUES HAVE FALLEN 50% IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS AND WE PREDICT SIXTY FIVE MILLION AND THE NEXT TWO YEARS- FROM THESE DECLINES IN ECONOMIC SHOCKS AND THIS IS ON A BUDGET OF ONLY A HUNDRED AND TE MILLION DOLLARS SO WE ARE A SMALL BUT MIGHTY ORGANIZATION. WITH AT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR BALANCE SHEET SO IT'S REALLY SUBSTANTIAL AND DEEP IMPACTS. AS OUR TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT AND THE CITY'S GENERAL FUND WE'RE PREDICTING A PROJECTION PERIOD FOR THE COURT WE'RE LOOKING AT 28% DECLINE INVOLVING HIM. 30% 33% OF OUR STAFF IS AN ARMY INSIDE THE CRAFTS THAT MAINTAIN OUR FACILITIES FOR THE VALUE AND BENEFITS OF OUR TORRANCE AND OUR VISITORS AND TO. BUILD A VERY BEAUTIFUL WELCOMING AND SAFE HARBOR. TO DATE THE COURT IS REALLY THE STRATEGIES THAT DEPLETE OUR SAVINGS AND OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM BUT THIS CANNOT BE SUSTAINED OTHERWISE WE WILL HAVE TO SHATTER OTHER FACILITIES AND WE WILL NOT BE. POSITION TO WELCOME BACK VISITORS AND BE. PART OF THE STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY ADDING TO ITS RECOVERY INSTEAD WE WOULD BE A DEFICIT IF WE WERE TO CUT AS EXTREMELY AS THE REVENUE- YEAH DEBT AND DECLINE FROM THE VIRUS IS CAUSING AND THIS IS ALL OF THE REASONS THAT I AM VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF PORTS BEING. NOT PASSED OVER THIS TIME IN THE FEDERAL RELIEF BILL AND THROUGH THE STATE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT PORT STAND BY OUR COMMUNITIES AND ADDS VALUE TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY- BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE WELCOME TO TWENTY FOUR MILLION VISITORS PER YEAR HUGELY ECONOMICALLY IMPACTFUL SHRUM FISHERMAN'S WHARF TO ORACLE PARK TO THE EXPLORATORIUM. WE ARE LEADING THE WAY AND RESILIENCY. THIS CONFERENCE IS ABOUT RESILIENCE C. OR C. LAW RISE ADDRESS. RISK THIS IS A VERY. PROGRAM AT HAVE LOCALS. IN TOOK FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION AT THE- AS WELL AS FEDERAL SUPPORT TO LOOK AT HOW TO PROTECT URBAN SHORELINES FROM FLOOD. AND EARTHQUAKE RISK WE MUST CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM NOT ONLY FOR THE VALUE OF SAN FRANCISCO BUT OTHER URBAN PORTS IN THE STATE SB ON. CRUISE SHIPS OF COURSE WELCOME THOUSANDS OF VISITORS AND GENERATE. NUMEROUS. VALUE TO THE CITY. OUR TENANTS ARE CRITICAL LINK AND REGIONAL MARITIME INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL OUR TUG OPERATIONS SUPPORT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CARGO AS IT ENTERS THE MARY MARCH SO FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS. I WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR FEDERAL AND STATE SUPPORT AND RELIEF FUNDING TO CONDITION PORTS TO WEATHER AND RECOVER THE STORM AND BE PARTNERS IN SUPPORT FOR COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES MARITIME USES CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS TOURIST ECONOMY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION ARE REALLY ESSENTIAL TOOLS NEEDED TO HELP WORKERS BUSINESSES. AND LOCAL RESIDENTS RECOVER POST CODE NINETEEN I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SELECT COMMITTEE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU MISS FORBES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN DOOR. OUR NEXT PANEL THE WILL JUST HAVE QUESTIONS AT THE END THERE I DO WANNA KNOW THE PRESENCE OF A SIMILAR MIKE GIPSON. WHICH SHARES I GUESS WHAT I'M PROBABLY THE NORTHERN PART OF MY DISTRICT HE HAS- A% LOT OF THE PORT COMPLEX I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT. LOT OF GOODS MOVING. ACT A- IN HIS. AS WELL PRESENCE TODAY SO YOU MR GIBSON- WILL MOVE ON TO OUR GREEN PORTS AND THE STATEWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS OUR SECOND PANEL WILL DISCUSS THE INDUSTRY'S WORK TO MEET. OUR STATEWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED FROM STATE LEADERS. THESE PANELS WILL HAVE NO MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES AGAIN WE WILL HOLD QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS TO THE END. AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IF IT'S GREE. IT'S INNOVATIVE AND IT'S CUTTING EDGE IT'S HAPPENING IN THE PORTS. IN AN EFFORT TO CUT GREENHOUSE GASES EMISSIONS ECCENTRIC IT HAPPENED IN THE PORTS THAT'S WHERE IT'S ALL HAPPENING AT LEAST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A LOT GOING ON IN THE PORTS. FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM BILL VAN AMBURG EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF CAL START MISTER VAN AMBURG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF IT AND THAT SUCH A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TO TODAY. I AM BUILDING AT BURKE EXEC VP AT CAL STARTED WE ARE A CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY ORGANIZATION. OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY COMPANIES WERE BASED IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO WORK A NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY ON THESE. AND I DO HAVE SOME SLIDES THAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU HERE TODAY. HOW TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF- WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS GOING BECAUSE I THINK EVEN AS WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH THE PANDEMIC- AND OTHER ISSUES AND HOPEFULLY. WELL LET'S NOT THE SCREEN I WANTED TO SHARE IS IT. TRY THAT AGAIN I EVEN AS WE STRUGGLE WITH THE PANDEMIC- RIGHT NOW WE ARE ALSO FACING A TREMENDOUS TIME TO MOVE FORWARD THE GREEN TECHNOLOGY. THAT NOT ONLY WE NEED FOR OUR URBAN RESIDENTS WHO WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR MORE CLARITY IN THEIR ERROR BUT ALSO ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREATER. COMPETITIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY IN OUR WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN SO IT ISN'T AN X. REALLY EXCEEDINGLY EXCITING TIME NOW WE MANAGE A NUMBER OF THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IN THE STATE THE H. FIP PROGRAM FOR TRUCKS AND BUSES TO BUY DOWN THEIR COSTS AND THE CLEAN OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT PROGRAM. WHICH HELPS FOR- EQUIPMENT AT THE PORTS IN GOODS MOVEMENT THESE ARE THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT WE REALLY NEED THE STATE TO FURTHER EXPAND AND GROW TO HELP OUR PORTS- ANDOTHERS ACHIEVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WE HAVE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOALS THE ADVANCE CLEAN TRUCK RULES ARE THAT ARE PUSHING TOWARDS GREATER CLIMATE CHANGE AND ZERO EMISSION. ARE ACTUALLY BEING ADOPTED NOT ONLY BY OTHER REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES ABOUT THERE BEING ADOPTED BY OTHER NATIONS OF THE WORLD AND AS WE REALLY START TO SEE THIS- THIS CHANGE GOING ON IT'S SENDING A CLEAR SIGNAL TO INDUSTRY OF WERE INVESTMENTS NEED TO GO THESE ONLINE POLICIES. REALLY. A PROVIDE TREMENDOUS STRENGTH. TO AND ALL HOPEFULLY THIS IS A CHANCE TO GIVE YOU SOME OF. THESE PICTURES HERE WHAT WE'RE TALKING THIS REALLY SENSE A SIGNAL TO INDUSTRY. OF WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND HELPS THEM FURTHER ALIGN THEIR BEST MONTH SO THAT THEY CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE GOALS AS WE GO FORWARD- NOW WHERE IS THE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY AS A SENSE OF WHAT IS THE REALITY. WHAT'S MOVING FORWARD AND CAN WE MAKE THESE TECHNOLOGIES MOVE FORWARD ON THE PACE THAT WE WANT. SO I THINK- FIRST OF ALL. YOU CAN SEE A LIGHT DUTY SPACE OR THE- LOWER END OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY THE DELIVERY TRUCKS THERE'S TREMENDOUS CHANGE GOING ON BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY ALSO MOVING INTO. WHAT WE NOW VIEW AS THE HEAVIEST APPLICATIONS IN THE DRAYAGE APPLICATIONS ALL OF THESE PLATFORMS THAT YOU SEE HERE IS OR ACTUALLY IN EARLY PRODUCTION. OR ABOUT TO MOVE INTO PRODUCTION. TO A GREAT EXTENT BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENTS AND BECAUSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP SUPPORTS. THREE OPERATORS AND FLEETS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE SEEING. THE ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES MOVE FORWARD AT A PHENOMENAL PACE. WELL WE DO ALSO NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK THAT'S WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND WHAT'S MOVING FORWARD BUT WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT CAN WE DO NOW. AND THEN WHAT CAN WE DO AS WE MOVE TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN TWENTY THIRTY TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WE DO KNOW THAT ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT SERVICE OUR PORTS AND OUR REGIONS NEED TO BOTH ADDRESS CRITERION PENSIONS OR THINGS THAT CAUSE SMOG. AND CLIMATE EMISSIONS AND THEY NEED TO DO IT AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT THING THAT WE HAVE FACED IN A LONG TIME. NOW IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY READINESS WE KNOW THAT LOW EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES SOME PEOPLE CALL THOSE- NEAR ZERO SUCH AS NATURAL GAS LOW KNOCKS TRUCKS OR PROPANE. THEY ARE READY NOW AS WE'VE DONE THESE TECHNOLOGY ANALYSES OF READINESS FOR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ANOTHER PARTNERS AS YOU CAN SEE KIND OF WHERE THEIR CIRCLES ARE IN THE CRAFT. THERE AT THE COMMERCIAL STAGE AND THEY ARE DEFINITELY READY TO FOR ACTION. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE VERY AWARE OF WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE PIKE NEXT. AND WHEN IT COMES TO ZERO EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES THEY WERE CLOSE BEHIND. THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE MOVING FROM PILOT STAGE INTO THE EARLY COMMERCIAL STAGE OF MANUFACTURING INCLUDING IN DRAINAGE. AND REGIONAL HEAVY HAUL APPLICATIONS SO A LOT OF PEOPLE DO ASK CAN WE SHOULD THE SALES GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT BY THE STATE IN A C. T. IN THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOLS FOR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AT THE PORT SCHOOLS. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR ZERO EMISSIONS. AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES ABSOLUTELY WE CAN'T THE TECHNOLOGY IS ON THE PATH TO DO THAT. AND AS WE LOOK AT THAT PHASING FOR THAT TRANSITION WE CAN SEE. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY INTO THEY HAVE A STEP WITH PATIENTS AND INDEED. WE WILL BE SAYING A LONGER AND LONG HAUL TRUCKS. ZERO EMISSIONS- AT LEAST THE FIRST APPLICATIONS OF THOSE BY THE. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TIME FOR IT. AND AS WE WHAT. KIND OF MEASURE THE NUMBERS OF MODELS COMING INTO MARKET PLACE BOTH TODAY AND IN THE- WE- THE NUMBER OF MODELS BEING- AVAILABLE. IN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS DOUBLING BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO IT IS AN EXCITING TIME THE TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING. WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HAVING SAID THAT AND I HEARD WHAT WAS EARLIER SAID BUT CHERYL DONALD I REALLY RESPECT THAT. INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE OF OUR BIG LIPS WE ARE SEEING THE TECHNOLOGY MOVES FORWARD THE VEHICLES WILL BE THERE THE BUSINESS CASE IS ACTUALLY STARTED TO SHOW ITSELF.IN THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP THESE ARE GOING TO BE CHEAPER TO OPERATE VEHICLES. HOWEVER WE DO NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE WHEN IT COMES TO INSTALLING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE FUELING. TO SUPPORT THE- AS WE LOOK AT THIS WE'RE GOING TO SEE DEPOT CHARGING BEING THE FIRST PRIMARY- CHARGING THAT WE WILL NEED HOWEVER. WE WILL NEED TO HAVE REGIONAL FAST CHARGE HOPES TO MAKE SURE THAT TRADE TRUCKS NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR CYCLE WILL ALWAYS BE CLOSE TO A PLACE TO TOP UP WHETHER THAT'S- HYDROGEN WHETHER THAT'S ELECTRICITY OR- FIVE NATURAL GAS. WE ALSO WILL NAY CORD OR BASED ON A FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THESE LONG HAUL TRUCKS OUT ON THE ROAD AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. REALLY IN JUST THE NEXT FEW YEARS. SO THAT WE CAN BE LEANING TOWARDS OUR OUTCOME OF TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. SO WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT WE WOULD SEE IS NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MEET. ITS THE GOALS OF KEEPING ITS PORTS ACTIVE ITS GOODS MOVEMENT TO COMPETITIVE AROUND THE WORLD. WE WILL LOOK AT ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH HE STATE NEEDS TO BE A STRONG AND AGGRESSIVE PARTNER. NOT JUST ON THE REGULATORY SIDE WHICH IS NECESSARY TO SEND SIGNALS. BUT THEN ON THE INCENTIVE SIDE. ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. ON REALLY SETTING IN PLACE PILOT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE GREATLY HELPED FLEETS. UTILITIES AND PORTS WORK AND HOW TO GET TO SCALE FASTER. BUT WE NEED TO BE MORE INNOVATIVE AND ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THAT CAN BRING INDUCEMENTS AND BENEFITS INTO THE MARKET PLACE- AND THEN WE NEED ALL OF THESE OTHER PLAYERS CITIES UTILITIES AND FLEETS. ARE TO TAKE THEIR PART TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS ACTIVE RAMP UP. SO WITH THAT I WILL. I WILL STOP WELL MY PRESENTATION- BUT I THINK WE ARE AT AN EXCITING TIME. AND THE STATE IS POISED TO LEAD THE WORLD OTHERS ARE DOING THE SAME THING BUT CALIFORNIA'S STILL IS ON THE LEADING EDGE LET'S CHANGE. AND I WILL SAY AND THERE IS DEBATE ON THIS POINT BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THIS WILL MAKE OUR PORTS MORE COMPETITIVE. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL BE TO DO. AND WE'LL GET THEIR FIRST AND HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO LEAD. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU CHAIR OF DONALD AND- THAT IS MY TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MISTER ENAMORED BY RESPONDING TO MANY OF THESE REGULATIONS WITH INNOVATIONS SO THANK YOU WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MIKE JACOB. HIS VICE PRESIDENT GENERAL COUNSEL THE PACIFIC. MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION MR JACOB. GOOD MORNING- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIKE JACOB WHAT THE NSA- GOOD MORNING CENTER GONZALEZ. REALLY APPRECIATE YOU HAVING US AND- JUST WANT TO START BY ECHOING ALL THE OTHER COMMENTS THIS MORNING WE APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP THE CRITICAL SUPPORT FOR INDUSTRY IS THE FIRST CHANCE. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO- PUBLICLY SAY THANK YOU. FOR ALL THE SUPPORT OF THE LAST YEAR WE REALLY APPRECIATED THAT'S A- REALLY IMPORTANT I'M SO BLESSED THAT REPRESENTATIVES ACTUALLY. THERE AND I WALKED THE WALK AND NOT JUST TALK THE TALK SO WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT I DO HAVE A SHORT PRESENTATION- AND THEN I'M GONNA SHARE THAT WITH YOU RIGHT NOW- THE- TOPIC. OBVIOUSLY NEEDS A CONTEXT IN THE CONTEXT FOR US- IS THAT- WE HAVE BEEN MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS ON ON- THE ENVIRONMENT AFFRONT. AND WE HAVE BUT TO BUILD ON THOSE ARE QUALITY SUCCESSES WE HAVE TO DO IT PRACTICALLY WE HAVE TO DO IT. NOT KNOWING WHERE WE CAME FROM. I'M SO THE FIRST REAL BIG FOR A UP FROM THE STATE FROM A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE AND PERMANENT CENTER PERSPECTIVE CAME IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. WITH THE ADOPTION BECAUSE MOVEMENT EMISSION REDUCTION PLAN. NOT ONLY THAT- THAT COINCIDE WITH PASSAGE OF PROP ONE B. WHICH INCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TIME. BILL STATE COMMIT TO GROW- AND UNDER. OF VERSION OF THE- THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN WITH RESPECT AIR QUALITY BUT THE GOVERNMENT MEASUREMENT PRODUCTION PROGRAM ADDITIONALLY IT RESULTED IN A SERIES IN A SUITE OF REGULATIONS THAT COST. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT OVERTIME- AND THOSE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO HAVE RESULTS GOT A COUPLE OF YEARS OF. NUMBER FOR FOLKS TAKE A LOOK AT TWENTY FOURTEEN- YOU SEE WE HAVE VERY DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS- REPORTER ARB ACROSS THE BOARD IN TERMS OF- ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO CREATE A POLLUTANTS- HAND DYED DIESEL PM- SIXTEEN THE PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH EMISSIONS INVENTORY- THOSE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GROWING VERY DRAMATIC YOU CAN SEE THOSE THOSE ACROSS ALL SECTORS- AND- WHAT IT DOES WITH THAT THE LIMIT THAT YOU ALL NOW WHICH IS- ONCE YOU'VE DONE. THE REAL HEAVY LEFT. WHAT COMES NEXT IS EXCEPTIONAL EXCEPTIONALLY HARD BUT ALSO EXCEPTIONALLY EXPENSIVE- SO AFTER WE REDUCE THE FIRST 96% OF OUR DAYS WHAT MATTER FROM HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. AND EQUIPMENT FROM TWO THOUSAND NOT SIX THROUGH TWENTY SIXTEEN. LAST 4% IS. WHERE THINGS GET REALLY HARD AND EXPENSIVE- OF OAKLAND'S- I TWENTY SEVENTEEN INVENTORY. I KNOW THAT- OF NOTE THE- TRUCKING EMISSIONS FOR PEACE OF THE MATTER DOWN TO ZERO POINT THREE MONTHS PER YEAR AT SIX HUNDRED POUNDS ISRAEL MISSIONS FROM THE ENTIRE TRUCKING FLEET PORT OF OAKLAND- AND AT THE PORT OF LA IS THE TWENTY NINETEEN AIR QUALITY REPORT CARD. OUT THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE CLEANER ACTUAL PLAN GOALS- MARKETING EXCEEDED- IN TWENTY NINETEEN SO WE'RE WE'RE FOUR YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE I'M SURE- DIRECTOR GENERAL WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE. WITH SOME SPECIFICITY BUT WE ARE DOING HUMANS WORK WE ARE REALLY DOING A GREAT JOB AT REDUCING EMISSIONS IN THAT CONTEXT I THINK IT'S REFLECTIVE OF NOT JUST WAS INVESTMENTS IN THOSE REGULATIONS BUT ALSO. I THINK REFLECTIVE OF. IT'S WHICH IS- WE DO HAVE CONCENTRATED- IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY AND THOSE ARE WE NEED TO CONTROL FOR- BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GREATER SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN FOR EXAMPLE- WE ARE NOT. MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS ARE WRIT LARGE- AND AS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SHOW THAT WE'RE VERY ACTUALLY- SMALL. NET CONTRIBUTORS AND WHEN IT LOOKS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ESTATE AS A WHOLE WITH RESPECT TO OUR- GHG EMISSIONS. WE'RE ABOUT ZERO POINT ZERO SEVEN FOUR SEVEN. OF ALL STATE EMISSIONS AND I THINK THAT IS REALLY REFLECTIVE OF THE JOB THAT WE'VE DONE BUT ALSO THE SCOPE AND SCALE- OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE DONE REALLY WELL I KNOW I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME BUT OF TOUCH TO A CASE STUDIES REALLY QUICK. AND VESSELS BURKE. HERE'S WHAT ONE OF THE HAPPEN- THE REGULATIONS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOU SAW THE TWO THOUSAND SIX. WE PUT IN A REGULATION WE ARE PROJECTED TO HAVE A AMAZING REDUCTION IF YOU FOLLOW THE RULE. ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO- TWENTY TWENTY OF ZERO POINT ONE SEVEN. FUNDS PER DAY DIESEL PM PRODUCTION FOR ONE POINT FOUR THREE. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE CARD IS ACTUALLY PROJECTING BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY THIS YEAR WE ACTUALLY HAVE ZERO POINT ZERO SIX. SO WE ARE OUTPERFORMING OUR REGULATORY. POLLS THREE TWENTY THIRTY ONE THE- PROP PROJECTION BY A R. B. IS THAT WE'D BE AT ZERO POINT ONE ZERO. TRANSPORTATION DIESEL PM EVEN WITH ADDITIONAL GROWTH IN OUR SYSTEM OF ANOTHER DECK- THAT IS THAT IS PHENOMENAL CONTROL- AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE EVEN WITHOUT THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED. WITH RESPECT TO SHORE POWER RIGHT NOW- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE THE CONTEXT AGAIN- IT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT PEOPLE EXPECTED TO HAVE IN TERMS OF GROWTH- SEVEN THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT THE CITY- HERE IT IS. MORE SPECIFIC FOR SAN PEDRO BAY PORTS THOSE RED TRIANGLES THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OUR ACTUAL GROWTH. I'M SO WE'RE PLANNING FOR THESE THESE RULES WERE ALSO PLANNING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE- WE HAVE. CONSISTENTLY UNDERPERFORM THOSE AND IS YOUR SEATS- WITH RESPECT OUR OUR ACTUAL GROWTH THOSE GREEN LINES THAT REPRESENTS THE U. S. WEST COAST. PREPARE OAKLAND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST- AND WE ARE LOSING SOME MARKET SHARE SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US- IT LEADS US AND FOCUSING ON. HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE INVESTMENT IN IT BUT WAS COST HIGHEST RETURN. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GENERATING THE PROFITS THAT WE EXPECTED TO- AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO BE FLEXIBLE ABOUT ACHIEVING GOALS- RESULTS OF A STUDY THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING RIGHT NOW IS THAT. YOU CAN ACTUALLY ACHIEVE BETTER RESULTS IN TERMS OF CUMULATIVE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS- BOSS WITCHING TO HYBRID TECHNOLOGY WHICH WOULD INCLUDE DIESEL GENSETS WITH BATTERIES AS OPPOSED TO WAITING LONGER. FOR JUST ZERO EMISSIONS SO JUST FIVE YEARS EARLIER INTRODUCTION OF HYBRID- RUBBER TIRED GANTRY IN THIS EXAMPLE OR POP INTO OUR EMISSIONS BECAME A BNEFITS OF THOSE EMISSION REDUCTIONS IF YOU DO THOSE INVESTMENTS EARLIER. ACTUALLY MEAN THAT YOUR GONNA HAVE GREATER EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS BOTH IN GHGS AND IN AND OUT LOCAL. AND REGIONAL CRITERIA POLLUTANTS- TWENTY FOUR AT THE- BUT THEY'RE GOOD IN. AND FINALLY- JUST TO POINT OUT THAT THAT ALL THESE THINGS HAPPEN NOT JUST IN A STATEWIDE CONTESTS BUT IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT. IF YOU ARE DIVERTING CARGO. YOU ARE INCREASING GHGS THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE CARGO BY. FOR A REPEAT AND GULF COAST PORTS. OUR STUDY IS THAT IT WOULD- INCREASE EMISSIONS BY% THOUSAND SIX. THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND METRIC TONNES OF GHG EMISSIONS- THAT GOES BACKWARDS THAT IS NOT IN THE STATE'S GOALS. HANDED CERTAINLY DOES NOT CORRELATE WITH WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN ON THE ON THE BUSINESS SIDE EITHER SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE- THE HEARING AND- OUR OUR FOR A POLICY OF THIS PAST YEAR WILL BE TALKING ABOUT REALLY IS ABOUT HOW DO WE ALIGN PUBLIC FUNDING INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT LONG. TERM REMISSIONS IN NEAR ZERO. TRANSITIONS AND HOW DO WE PRIORITIZE FLEXIBLE COMPLIANCE OPTIONS AND SENATE FUNDING WHICH YOU. AND THAT WOULD GO FORWARD TO YOU- WORKING WITH THINGS HAPPEN AND THAT THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING US AND BE. HE DROPPED OFF THERE AT THE END THEIR ARMS JACOB THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION WHEN I REALLY WANT TO CHRISTIAN MODEL IT LIVES HERE IN THE ROOM. LIVE IN PERSON. AND HE IS FRAWLEY'S VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISSILE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE INVITATION HERE TODAY IT'S MY FIRST TIME IN THE BUILDING IN ABOUT A YEAR IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE AND HOW TO SAY. SO AGAIN MY NAME IS KRISHNA VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. SO PREPARING FOR TODAY'S PANEL- WE ARE ASKED TO CONSIDER SOME QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF TRUCKING IN CONTRIBUTING TO GREEN PARKS AND GREEN A GREEN GOODS MOVEMENT. AND MEETING THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WHAT ARE THE HURDLES AND WHAT SUPPORT IS NEEDED FROM THE STATE. TO THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT TRUCKING IS ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO GROUP IMPORTS IN OUR STATEWIDE GOALS. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THE TRUCKING HAS STEPPED UP HAS LED AND WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING THE YEAR. INCLUDED IN THE COMMITTEE PACKETS ARE THE LATEST EMISSION REDUCTION NUMBERS FROM THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AND I THINK MISTER JACOB COVERED SOME OF THIS ALREADY BUT- THROUGH ABOUT. ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN INDUSTRY INVESTMENT DIESEL PARTICULATE EMISSIONS FROM PORT TRUCKING. WHICH IS THE POLLUTANT OF CONCERN FOR LOCALIZED HEALTH IMPACT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. NITROGEN OXIDES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO REGIONAL OZONE LEVELS AND SMOG. HAVE FALLEN BY SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT. THESE EMISSIONS WILL AGAIN FALL IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ONCE THE STATE AIR BOARD STATEWIDE RULES ARE FULLY PHASED IN. SO WHILE EMISSIONS ARE DOWN ACROSS OLD PORT RELATED EQUIPMENT AND I GOT TO GIVE COMPLIMENTS TO ALL OF OUR PORT PARTNERS OF FOR THAT. QUITE LITERALLY NO SEGMENT OF THE INDUSTRY HAS DONE MORE TO REDUCE THESE POLLUTANTS AND TRUCKING. AS WE MOVE FORWARD YOU CAN EXPECT TRUCKS TO GET EVEN CLEANER IS- CARBON BOTH FEDERAL EPA- LOOK TO ADOPT A NEW LOWER KNOCKS STANDARDS TO GET TO THAT VERY FINAL INCREMENTS. OF THOSE KNOCKS- SMOG FORMING EMISSIONS. A CARD DATA ALSO SUGGESTS THAT GROSS EMITTERS MAKING UP JUST CONTRIBUTES 65% OF ALL. PARTICULATE EMISSIONS AND SO I WANT TO REPEAT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A STAKE. 3% OF ALL TRUCKS ON THE ROAD- DUE IN ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF ALL THE EMISSIONS. SO IF YOU SEE A SMOKING TRUCK. IS LIKELY EITHER NOT COMPLIANT WITH STATE REGULATIONS IS SEVERELY MALFUNCTIONING OR HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY TAMPERED WITH SO. IF YOU GET THOSE CONSIDERING COMPLAINTS ABOUT SMOKING TRUCKS THAT THOSE ARE NOT PROPERLY FUNCTIONING. TRUCKS WITH FUNCTIONING EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS TO QUOTE THE A RESOURCES BOARD. VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE DIESEL PARTICULATES. DELETE BETWEEN A GROSS EMITTING A TRUCK IN A CLEAN ONE IS ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANT LARK SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER. THAN MOVING FROM A CLEAN DIESEL TO ELECTRIC. D. D. CLEANER DIESELS ARE SO MUCH. BETTER THAN ONE WHICH IS AGGRESSIVE MALFUNCTIONING THAT THAT IS THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK RATHER THAN MOVING TO ELECTRIC. AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE RESOURCES BOARD ON PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THESE GROSS EMITTERS WITHOUT OVER BURDENING. THE VA'S MAJORITY OF TRUCK OWNERS WHO ARE PERSON COMPLY IN GOING ABOUT THEIR- THEIR BUSINESS IN THE RIGHT WAY. BUT AS WE KNOW AND HAVE DISCUSSED TODAY THE GOAL OF THE STATE IS TO TRANSITION A SPECIFICALLY PORT DRAYAGE TRUCKS ZERO EMISSION BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND AS WE LOOK TOWARDS THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS THERE'S A MAJOR HURDLES THAT ALL BREAK INTO FOUR CATEGORIES. COST WEIGHT RANGE AND INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR COST ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS COST APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN THEIR DIESEL COUNTERPARTS A BRAND NEW DIESEL TRUCK COSTS. ANYWHERE FROM A HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS ARE GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE. AND I DO WANNA AGREE WITH MR VAN AMBURG THERE ARE POSSIBLE- COST SAVINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE THERE FOR FEWER MOVING PARTS. GENERALLY SPEAKING ELECTRICITY IS MORE CHEAP. BUT WE STILL REALLY DON'T HAVE REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE WITH THOSE SAVINGS- THEY CAN WEIGH AS MUCH AS SIX TO EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS MORE THAN A DIESEL TRUCK THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO. YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO HAVE MORE TRUCKS TO MOVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF CARGO- THE RANGE IS LIMITED TO ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES PER CHARGE DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE BATTERY PACK. NOT EXACTLY SUITABLE FOR LONGER RANGE FALLS. AND FINALLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CHARGING FUEL THESE TRUCKS IN THE CASE OF HYDROGEN. IS NEARLY NONEXISTENT WERE REALLY STARTING FROM THE GROUND LEVEL OP. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT- ISSUES PERTAINING TO INFRASTRUCTURE ARE GOING TO BE. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. VERY SITE SPECIFIC THERE'S NO GENERALIZATION ABOUT HOW EASY IT IS TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE. JUST HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU KNOW IF A NEW SUBSTATION UPGRADE IS REQUIRED FOR ONE OF THE SITES. THAT COULD BE AS MUCH AS A FIVE TO SEVEN YEAR PROCESS FIRST TIMER HEARD HAD ABOUT A MONTH AGO SO. A VERY COMPLICATED. AB GIVEN THESE CHALLENGES THE BEST USE CASE AND I THINK I'M AGREEING. WITH MR VAN AMBURG ON THIS- FOR TODAY'S REMISSION TRUCKS. ARE REALLY LOCAL HALL SMALLER CLASS TRUCKS. WERE WEIGHT IS NOT AN ISSUE. ARE YOU OPERATE ON A RELATIVELY FIXED ROUTE WITHIN LIMITED RANGES YOU CAN USE A SMALLER AND SHE PER BATTERY. AND YOU CAN SENSE YOUR DEPOT CHARGE OVERNIGHT IN ONE LOCATION- TO AVOID A TIME USE AND DEMAND CHARGES YOU REALLY WANT TO CENTRALLY CHARGE VERY SLOWLY. AT A TIME WHERE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE PENALIZED FOR DOING SO. YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY PORT DRAYAGE IS NOT NECESSARILY THIS BEST USE CASE. IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS WE'RE LIKELY LOOKING AT A SMALLER SUBSET OF DRAYAGE WORK WHICH IS GOING TO BE SUITABLE. FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES WE KNOW IT TODAY. AND EVEN THEN INDUSTRY IS GOING TO NEED SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FROM THE STATE. RESOURCES BOARD ESTIMATES IT NEEDS ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO ACCOMPLISH ITS TRUCK ELECTRIFICATION GOALS. THE GOVERNOR'S CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR SO THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT GAP- THIS UNDERSCORES THE NEED TO RE AUTHORIZE EXISTING INCENTIVE FUNDS AND LOOK FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP TRUCKERS. FOR ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. BEATS SALES TAX CREDITS FINANCING MECHANISMS I THINK THAT THE TERM WAS USE ALL HADS ON DECK. THE STATE MUST EMPLOY EVERY% TOOL AT ITS DISPOSAL IF IT IS SERIOUS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING THESE GOALS. AND THE TIMELINE SET OUT. IN EVEN WITHOUT SUPPORT I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO. TEMPER SOME EXPECTATIONS I THINK YOU'VE- HEARD THE OPTIMISTIC SIDE I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW BRING A LITTLE BIT- OF THE REALISTIC SIDE TO THIS THAT. THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY- EXPENSIVE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED TRANSITION. AND WE ARE STARTING NEARLY FROM SCRATCH THE HEAVY DUTY. ELECTRIC TRUCKING MARKET IS REALLY LAGGING LIGHT DUTY BUT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE DECADES. AND SO THEREFORE. YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST URGE. POLICY MAKERS TO NOT DEFINE SUCCESS OR FAILURE BY THE ABILITY TO MEET ARBITRARY GOALS AND TIMELINES. BUT WE REALLY NEED TO COLLECTIVELY ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. FOCUS ON THE HARD WORK AHEAD TO GET REAL TRUCKERS IN REAL ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. MAKING A REAL LIVING. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. PARTICIPATE HERE TO. GREAT I THANK YOU MR SCHIMMEL FOR ALWAYS BEING A VOICE FOR THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION GREEN. THE CHOCOLATES ROUTINES TO THE TABLE SO ALL OFTEN WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA TOMORROW. WAS EXPECTED DIRECTOR THE PORT. OF LONG BEACH I KNOW WE HAVE OUR PEOPLE ON THE LINE AFTER THIS WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE SPEAKERS- WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT A JUST SHORT OF NOON. SO LET'S PROCEED WITH MR MARIO CORDERO OF LONG BEACH PORT OF LONG BEACH. CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME. I CAN HEAR YOU OKAY THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE I HAVE A POWER POINT PRESENTATION BUT THANK YOU GERALD ON THE MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING THE PORT COMMITTEE ISSUED A PROPOSED SOLUTIONS TO MAKING CALIFORNIA AGREED TO CALL. I PERSONALLY WANT TO THANK A SINGLE DAUGHTER WHO REPRESENTS LONG BEACH FOR BEING AN IMPACTFUL ADVOCATE FOR THE PORT AND THE CITY LONG BEACH AND ALSO THANK SENATOR LENA CONSULTANTS NOT ONLY FOR HER SUPPORT OF THE PORT INDUSTRY BUT OBVIOUSLY HER COMMENTS SHE MADE. THIS MORNING WHICH ARE VERY A PROPOS. I AM THE EXECUTOR OF THE PRO LOBBYIST SECOND LARGE CONTAINER PORT IN UNITED STATES TOGETHER WITH THE PRO LOS ANGELES OUR TOPICS ACCOUNTS FOR FORTY PERCENT. OF GOODS MOVED IN THE COUNTRY. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC OR POOR SPAWNING DECLINED BY 8% WHAT OTHER PORTS SUCH AS HOUSTON. SALAS TEN POINT THREE INCREASING THEIR CARGO AND STATE. IN GEORGIA A 7% INCREASE. OTHER WORDS ARE BECOMING MORE. BECAUSE THEY'RE STATES HAVE THANK YOU HALF AND CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE SUCCESS OF THE REPORTS. PUTTING CALIFORNIA AND A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE NATIONAL. WHAT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO GET OVER LOS ANGELES THAT IS PORTABLE AIR CLEAN TRUCK PLANT. WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND INSPIRE SIMILAR PROGRAMS WERE OPEN AND NEW YORK NEW JERSEY. LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PROGRAM HAS IMPROVED SAFETY SECURITY AND AIR QUALITY BY BETTING TRUCK THAT DID NOT MEET TWO THOUSAND SEVEN COVER EMISSIONS STANDARDS. OKAY THERE ARE MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TRUCKS REGISTERED IMPORTER LOBBIES PORTABILITY CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAM WITH NEARLY 60% MEETING AT LEAST TWENTY TEN STANDARDS AND THE GROWING NUMBER NEARLY NOW A QUARTER DEPLETE OUR MODEL YEAR TWENTY FOURTEEN OR NEW YORK. THE CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAM HAS REDUCED AIR POLLUTION FROM HARPER TRUCKS. BY ABOUT 90% THE PROGRAM WHICH HAS INVESTED MORE IN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO EVERY CONTAINER. IS EQUIPPED WITH ARE PAR FOUR SHIPS PLUGIN AT BIRTH TO POWER PUMPS LIGHTING COMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER SYSTEMS. RATHER THAN RUNNING ON DIESEL ENGINES. THIS IS LED TO A 95% REDUCTION IN RELATED EMISSIONS NEXT ONE. THE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN UPDATE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT'S AN AMBITIOUS BUT A VIABLE PLAN INCLUDES THOSE OF JURY MISSION KARBO HAVING IT PUT IN BY TWENTY THIRTY AND- YOUR MISSION TRUCKS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. BEING THE FIRST IN SOMETHING THAT IS BIG AND WHAT EMAIL IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT. WE OPTED FOR THE CAB TWO THOUSAND SIX WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD BE THE END OF OUR BUSINESS. INSTEAD WE'RE THRIVING. BEING ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE ONE REMAINING COMPETITIVE AND EVEN CHANGING MARKET COMES WITH MANY CHALLENGES. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT GROWING OUR BUSINESS AND GROWING GRADE ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. RICHARD SHIRO STRAIGHT STROKES BUT THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THOSE TRUCKS RANGE ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR TRUCKS. AT A OF YOUR COLLECTIONS HE BIGGEST. ROAST AND LOCAL TAXES AND INSURANCE. HOW IS IT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE FOR INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS OR EVEN. COMPANIES TO MAKE SUCH AN EX YEAH IN FACT THE CRIPPLING COMMERCE THE BETTER. ALL AND ALL IT'S FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR. IN QUESTION IS THAT REALLY IT MARKET READY. WE NEED TO BUILD A SO BIRDS. TO GET A SECURITY. BUT THAT WE WOULD THAT WILL TAKE TIME AS YOU HEARD DEALERS. THE NEW TERM SOLUTION TO GET CLEANER NOW IS TO GET MORE NEAR ZERO MISS TRUCKS THE ROAD. WHAT WHAT ZERO TECHNOLOGY TO MARKET. NEAR ZERO TRUCKS EXIST. AND COME A SMALL WHICH AHEAD DEPRIVED UPON HUNTER. THOUSAND OR ENOUGH GAS. THIS IS MORE OF. NEAR ZERO TO. WE CAN CLEAN THE AIR NOW. VERSUS WAITING TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS FROM.I SUPPORT MOVES TOWARDS NEAR ZERO ENSURING MISSION OPERATIONS IT'S REAL. ON. WE NEED AN ENERGY AND SHE PLAN EXCELLENT. YES THE MINUTE COSTS TO CHEAT REPORTS CLEANER ACTION PLAN JURY MISSION GOAL IS ESTIMATED TO BE ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE TO FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY TWENTY. THANKS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN WELL THE FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION JURY MISSION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT ITS ZERO EMISSION EXECUTIVE ORDER AND CARP ESTIMATES WILL PROVIDE A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION. EIGHT HUNDRED PROJECT BUT THE COST TO ACHIEVE THAT IS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY BILLION NATIONAL. THE SECOND HELP. WE CAN HOW YOU CAN HELP. ME FURTHER US INDICATE THAT PROPOSAL SUCH AS ASSEMBLY O'DONNELL'S AB THREE SIXTY FIVE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE SALE TAX EXEMPTION FOR NEAR ZERO ANSWERED MISSION HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. WILL GREATLY OF. IS THE FIRST STEP FOR SURE THE PARLIAMENT IS PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. OTHER TUNES INCLUDE EXPEDITED PERMITTING BERMAN STREAMLINED PROCESS WITHOUT. WITHOUT COMPRISED HI FROM RISING BY MIDDLE PROTECTIONS TAX CREDITS FOR HEAVY DUTY ZERO EMISSION. VEHICLES AND CREATING AFFORDABLE INSURANCE POLICY OPTIONS FOR THOSE NEW BRICK INCLUDES. INCENTIVES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN REGULATIONS WHAT DID YOU REGULATION WE ARE MAKING CALIFORNIA LESS COMPETITIVE TO OTHER US SPORTS. THE NATIONAL ARBITRATION ZERO EMISSION REQUIREMENTS WHAT HELPED TO STRENGTHEN THE BROADER MARKET FOR THESE VEHICLES AND KEEP THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS CALIFORNIA COMPONENT. WE ALSO NEED STATE LEADERS TO ADVOCATE ZERO MISSION AND INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. ARE COMPELLED TO STAY SEPARATED STRONG COALITIONS WITH CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS WITH SUCCESSFULLY SECURED TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AT BONDING THAT HAVE MADE THEIR PORTS MORE COMPETITIVE. WITH THE SEPARATE A BIG COMPLEX ACCOUNTING 440% OF THE CARBON TO UNITED STATES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NEEDS TO HAVE A GREATER ROLE IN PROTECTING AND EXPANDING ITS MARKET. SURE SO WE. COULD GET RID STE. THAT'S LIKE AND THE LAST. FIFTEEN YEARS THE PORT BEACH OUT TO WHAT SOME IMPOSSIBLE AS IT WERE MODEL POOREST REDUCE RISKS AND AIR QUALITY IN TO IS TO MAKE. ONCE BUT WE CANNOT DO THIS ALONE AS YOU HEARD TODAY WHEN YOU THE STATE'S ASSISTANCE ON MANY FRONTS TO HELP US ACHIEVE THESE AMBITIOUS AND GROW OUR ECONOMY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY AND POOR LOBBY STANDS READY TO HELP THE STATE ACHIEVED ITS ZERO EMISSION FUTURE THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR THANK YOU MARIO THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING A LEADER ON THESE ISSUES APPRECIATED AND THAT'S WILL GO TO KRISTEN BECAUSE US YOU SEE ON PORT DIRECTOR FROM THE PORT OF HUENEME ME. RESPOND GOOD MORNING- I MEAN I KNOW THE LAST PER CENTER HERE AND I'LL MAKE SURE I GET TO THE OINT QUICKLY IS KIND OF SET ME UP ON A BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD HERE THIS MORNING- I AM GOING TO. SHARE HERE I THINK A POWER POINT- THE END I THINK I DID IT. EVERYONE SEE THAT. YES OKAY GREAT I'M SO REALLY JUST QUICKER WHEN HE ME- WE ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST CARGO PORT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE THE SECOND LARGEST BANANA IMPORTER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SERVING AS SUCH A THIRTEEN STATES IMPORTANT PRODUCE COMMODITIES REMOVE AUTOMOTIVE CARGO AND- WE'VE ALSO SERVED AS A RIB RIVER VALLEY IN ON THIS PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF HELPING WITH AG EXPORTS AS WELL AS- MOVING ON ENTITIES- BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. SO JUST A QUICK HIGHLIGHT THERE ARE WHAT WE DO BUT WANTED TO REALLY HONE IN ON ON THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE WAS COURTS DAYS YESTERDAY AND WE WENT ALONG WITH THIS THEME OF MEETING THE MOMENT AND I'M THIS FOCUS GROUP WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE LEADING THE WORLD AND THAT IS THE TRUTH REALLY LEADING THE WORLD IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS- B. AS THE- COURT SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA ALONE REDUCE PARTICULATE MATTER KNOCKS 50% OUR PORTS ARE DOING REALLY BIG THINGS WERE REALLY ON THE CUSP OF INNOVATION WITH A SHORT SIGHT POWER SYSTEMS- ALL THE EVR CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT AND WHEN YOU ME WE ARE GOING TO BE PILOTING ARM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE L. A. HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCKS ON HIM WHEN HE ME WE PUT UP THE AIR QUALITY OF MONITORS IN A SCHOOL THAT'S NEAR THE PARDON WE'RE MATCHING OUR. AND WE'RE SHARING THAT- WITH THE KEY. THE WE CAN BE- OPEN AND- ABOUT. WHAT OUR AIR LOOKS LIKE HERE- WE GOTTEN FOR NEW AYE. ME THREE NEW. HYBRID CRANES THAT WE CAN PLUG IN AND THE STORY OF THE PORTS IS THAT WE ARE REALLY. THINKING BIG AND MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE AREA OF THE AIR QUALITY- AND THAT SAID I THINK WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP TELLING THAT STORY. I'M BECAUSE I THINK THAT GETS LOST AS MORE AND MORE AND MORE WITH NO PUN INTENDED. INTENDED COMES ON DECK SO THERE'S A SLEW OF REGULATIONS IN THE PIPELINE. WE HAVE THE AB MANDATE THERE'S AT BIRTH REGULATIONS FOR NEW CLASS FASSEL'S HIGH HEAVY MEDIUM TRUCKS. HARBOR CRAFT REGULATIONS CARGO HANDLING- WHAT MADE REGULATIONS AND THEN THERE'S THE WHOLE OTHER SECTOR OF OUR INDUSTRY THAT'S ALSO GETTING REGULAR- REGULATED. AND WHEN WE GO TO SAY IN A R. B. MEETING AND RAISE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT ENERGY CAPACITY FOR FILL ALL THESE MANDATES THEY TELL US THAT THAT- THE UTILITY PROVIDERS ARE SET THEY CAN PROVIDE THE POWER. YEAH WHEN WE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS- ARM HE PARTICULARLY WHEN HE MADE. THE UTILITY PROVIDER SAYS- YOU NEED TO WE NEED TO DO A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR UPGRADE SHE EVEN JUST DO YOUR NEXT LEVEL. OF THE- OF THE EEVEE CAPACITY FORGET ABOUT GETTING TWO ZERO. AND THEN THAT UTILITY PROVIDER WANTS US TO DO THAT FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS IN THAT I THINK SHOULDN'T BE ON THE BACKS OF THE POOR TO UNDERSTAND THE ENERGY NEEDS. OF OUR STATE. TO BRIAN THREE OUR ARMY THAT THE- TEST OF ALL THESE- REGULATE IN THE- CERTAINLY ONE TO HELP THIS. GETS THEIR BUT THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE LEVEL COMPREHENSIVE. ANALYSIS OF WHAT IS THE REAL FEASIBILITY OF GETTING US TO THE FINISH LINE WITH ALL THESE REGULATIONS AND WHAT ARE THE TRUE ENERGY NEEDS- TO SUPPORT. THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS- AND WE WOULD LOOK AT THE STEEP THE STATE FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP FOR THAT AND WE WOULD THINK MAYBE THERE COULD BE A LEGISLATIVE. IN SET UP OF BLADE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS THAT CLAPPER- ASIAN ACROSS ALL THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION- COM. AND THEN ONCE THAT'S UNDERSTOOD. THE NEXT QUESTION IS MARIO AND MY COLLEAGUES BROUGHT UP IS HOW DO WE PAY FOR THIS WE REALLY NEED YOU TO PLAN BOTH ON THE ENERGY USAGE. AND A PLAN ON IDENTIFYING THE VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES WE APPLY THE- THREE SIXTY FIVE AND HOPE THAT GETS OVER THE FINISH LINE THERE ARE FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE WE NEED STATE SUPPORT TO ACCESS THOSE DOLLARS. CERTAINLY IT'S MARIO POINT OUT IT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET- NEEDS TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT THESE BIG ROBOTS PLANS AND THEN THE OTHER NOTE IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF GRANTS OUT THERE. AND IT OFTEN SEEMS LIKE ONE HANDED IN TALKING TO THE OTHER HAND THERE'S ALL THESE- PRESSURES ON THE PORTS TO. MOVE FORWARD WITHTHESE BIG ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS AND THEN WE GO AND- APPLY FOR GRANTS AND THAT WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS THERE'S AN EXAMPLE IN WHEN AMY WHERE WE WANTED TO GO. TO THE OF THE REGULATION ON ON THAT BRO BROKE UP. INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PLUG IN OR UPON ITS SYSTEM AND- WE WERE DENIED THE GRANT BECAUSE IT WAS AN ELIGIBLE FOR VOTES WAGON FUNDING JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A KIND OF A ONE HAND TALKING THE OTHER HAND WHEN IT COMES TO GRANDSON REALLY. INSURING THAT THERE'S FUNDING OUT THERE FOR US TO DO BIG THINGS AND CONTINUE TO DO BIG THINGS- AND THEN JUST IN CLOSING JUST TO. REITERATE WHAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY ARE ARE WORKERS ARE OUT THERE ON THE FRONT. LINE WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP BUT IT'S AND THAT ALL OF OUR CENTER WORKERS AND HOPE THEY'LL BE. GET THE SHOTS IN THIS PORTS LIKE WINNING- WE DON'T WANT TO. ANYONE IT. TRY SO WITH THAT I HOPE I MET MY TO TALKED. AND THANK YOU FOR SPIKE COMMITTEE PROTECT. DAY LISTENING TO ALL OF US TIME IN OUR REPORTS. OF AND THE GOODS MOVE INDUSTRY- THANK YOU MISTER. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR- WITH THE CALIBER. TO CALIFORNIA AIRES'S RARE RESOURCES BOARD. WAS IN THE PORTION BE THEIR PLAYGROUND. THEY SHOULD BE A PLACE TO PROVIDE JOBS MOVE GOODS IN AND OUT. BUT THAT WHEN WE CONTEMPLATE REGULATION IT'S THOUGHTFUL. ITS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL- ONE THING IS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR RESOURCES POOREST PICKING A TECHNOLOGY IN SAYING YES THAT'S IT. WHEN IN FACT THEY SHOULD BE SETTING THE BAR. THE ISSUE SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE WITH REGARD TO A CLEANER GOALS NOT SAYING THIS IS THE TECHNOLOGY WE WANT TO YOU TWO YEARS. I THINK THAT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR INNOVATION. SO WE SHOULD NOT JUST REGULATE BUT WE SHOULD INNOVATE. AND IT WOULD JUST REGULATE WE DON'T ALLOW. FOR OTHER TO BE INNOVATIONS THANK YOU- SO WITH THAT I DO I WILL GO TO QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW- AND I HAVE A QUESTION FROM THE SENATE YOUR CURRY SHE HAD TO TAKE OFF AND I THINK HER. UP A LOT OF FOLKS CONCERN AROUND THE STATE RIGHT NOW MAYBE THIS GOES TO MR CORDERO- HAS TO DO WITH- THE BACKLOG. IN A STATE- THERE ARE THERE'S A BUNCH OF SHIPS OUT THERE OFF OF THE COAST OF LONG BEACH IN LA- THAT ARE WAITING TO UNLOAD- BECAUSE THE BACKLOG REPORTS ARE FOR THE WAREHOUSE WAS OUR FULL COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT SITUATION. IN A PRETTY EFFICIENT MANNER AND THEN ALSO ABOUT WHAT THE WHAT THE- WHAT THE SOLUTION WITH. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER TIME WITH REGARD TO THAT CHALLENGE. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH OF. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION AND IT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE LET ME PREFACE BY SAYING. THIS CERTAINLY SHOWS THE INTEREST IN STATE WHERE. THE TOTAL COMMUNITY IT IS THE GATEWAY TO THE LARGEST KIT WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE PREFERRED K. SO IF NOTHING ELSE IT REALLY GIVES CALIFORNIA. SORT OF A RED FLAG FOR US AND WE DON'T DO THE RIGHT THINGS WE WILL NO LONGER BE A PREFERRED GATEWAY FOR THE REGION OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING SO WHAT WE DO GOING FORWARD FOR PERMAUL BEACH WE INVEST A LOT OF. INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS GOING FORWARD LITTLE ONE POINT SIX BILLION BUT TOGETHER. WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN INVEST IN THAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO MOVE TOWARDS GREATER EFFICIENCY RELIABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY SO THAT'S WHAT THE INDUSTRY IS OUR CUSTOMERS ARE REQUIRED SO THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO DO THIS TOGETHER. AND LAST I WILL ALSO SAY THIS. I THINK IT'S. IT'S A CONVERSATION I'VE HAD. HER DAUGHTER WAS AWARE MY VIEWS THANKS. THIS ABSENT TELLS US THAT THE NEED FOR US TO GO TO SEVEN ON. HERE IS COMING TOWARD ANTI. WE CANNOT THIS TYPE PARTICLE. HERE TO SORT OF CALIFORNIA SEVENTEEN MILLION TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY. AND EXPECTANT WE'RE NOT HAVING. ANY CREDIBLE NAKED WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS MY COLLEAGUE. AND I AM SURE OKAY. G. STROKING RETURN OPERATORS WORKING TO. DEFINITELY THE VISIT OF TWENTY FOUR SO GONNA COME HERE SIR THAN LATER. YEAH I KNOW THAT THE LABOR IS READY TO DO THAT. THANK YOU I WANNA GO TO ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE TODAY IF YOU'D LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS. YEAH THREE OF THEM BOB THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THROUGH THE CHAIR OF. SOME NOTES HERE WELL I JUST WANTED TO FIRST THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS TODAY ALL THE SPEAKERS- THE- LEARN A LOT. BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THE VESSELS THAT ARE OR- WHEN I THE LANE OR OR OR WAITING THERE- AND I WANNA JUST ECHO WHAT THE PORT DIRECTOR- THE OAKLAND IS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THE ONE THING THAT I DO KNOW THAT I'VE LEARNED FROM BEING HERE. IS THAT WE GOTTA HAVE A PLAN WE GOT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A PLAN I MEAN IT'S- IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THE PLANNED FOR TOMORROW BUT WE NEED TO PLAN FOR TODAY AND IF WE COULD WORK- WITH. ALL OF THE PORTS YOU KNOW TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE- BOTTOM LINE YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO COMPETITION- WE'RE COMPETE WE'RE COMPETING WITH FOLKS FROM. YOU KNOW PEACE IT- BACK EAST AND WHEN WORKING ONE THING THAT I ALSO KNOW IS THAT WHEN IT COMES OF VENDORS. THEY'RE GONNA GO TO FOLKS THAT ARE EITHER. BETTER FASTER AND- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES RIGHT SO. I'M HOPING THAT WE COULD ALL COME TOGETHER AND MAKING SURE THAT I CAN YOU KNOW WE CAN ECHO WHAT WITH THE DIRECTOR OF OAKLAND SAID IS THAT WE GOT IT WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. AND CREATE A PLAN SO THAT'S JUST A COMMENT- MISTER CHAIRMAN SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE HAVING SOMEONE FROM THE PORT OF STOCKTON HERE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE IN THE STATES I MEAN OUR OUR AREA WE'RE WE HAVE- WE'RE TRUCKING HUB AND I WAS GLAD THAT THE- CITY IT WAS HERE YOU KNOW WE ARE TRACKING HUB YOU KNOW WEEK WEEK TO MOVE CARGO WE HAVE WAREHOUSES. IN OUR DISTRICT AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE READY TO GO SO WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO- THE PORT OF STOCKTON- IS LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING A BIG. PART OF TRYING TO HELP HELP THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU GIBSON DID YOU TO. IT IS ON HAVE AS FEDERAL. I'M KNOW IF G. PERSONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN. AND TO ALL THE PRESENTERS FOR BEING HERE. I DON'T KNOW OF GENES- IS STILL IS STILL HERE BUT I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION- WHAT ACTIONS OR LEGISLATION CAN THE STATE WORK ON TO GET. THE PORTS BACK ON TRACK POST CODE EX NINETEEN. I THINK WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT. WHAT THAT PLAN SHOULD BE AS- A TERMINAL DIAL INDICATED THERE IS A LOT OF. VESSELS THAT AWAITING- IN WATERS TO TRY TO GET IN WHAT IT WHAT SHOULD WE BE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO GET. THINGS BACK ON TRACK- THAT'S POST CODE NINETEEN. SO WHERE WAS THE ADDRESS THAT YOU WILL LOVE. COMPLAINTS I CAN ADDRESS THAT SOMETHING AND TAKE YOUR QUESTION I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE I'D BE REMISS NOT TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESSES. OF PORT RELIEVES YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING THAT AT A VERY ACTIVE LEVEL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. COURSE AT THE STATE LEVEL. OBVIOUSLY YOU SEEN THIS INDUSTRY RESEARCH OPERATION HAS WORKED DAY IN AND DAY OUT OUR MEN AND WOMEN ON THE WATERFRONT. JUST BEGINNING OF THIS CRISIS SO THE FIRST PART OF THAT- MY ANSWER IS UP FOR RELIEF WITH REGARD TO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE EXPENDITURES THAT WE MADE HERE. THE PORT DISTRICT. NUMBER TWO IS REGARD TO WHAT WE DO TOGETHER TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS WORK OF FICTION. AND I THINK THE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULARLY RAIL. RAIL IS THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF HELPING MOVE CONTAINERS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND- WITH IT. A FRIENDLIER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT SO I THINK BECAUSE- OF THE WORK NEEDED TO RECESSED PORTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO CREATE EFFICIENCIES AND CONGESTION. I THINK THE BETTER. AND I THINK THE LOSSES WHAT I SAID PREVIOUSLY. THANK YOU US THIS POLICY AND LIKE COLLEAGUE- DAY. DANIELLE THE BOOK. JUST BASIC MISTER WE NEED UP AND THAT PLAN SOME CAN MY MIND HAS INCLUDE A- ANY FURTHERING A TWO OF COURSE VISION CARE WE NEED TO WORK SUPPORT UP NIGHT AND DAY AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE. LABOUR'S RIGHT TO DO THAT. THANK YOU CENTER GUNS ALL DID YOU WISH TO SHARE ANY ON SOCIAL COUNTY FIRST I APOLOGIZE. I DON'T HEAR HER RIGHT NOW SO WE'LL GO TO THE LINE- JUST JUST QUICKLY JUST TO MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE A- MR VANDENBERG PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZERO AND NEAR ZERO. AND WHY NIGHT NEAR ZERO MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO. TO PAY MORE FOCUS ON IN THE IN THE SHORT TERM. MISTER VANDENBERG ARE YOU STILL ON YEAH. YES I AM. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO I DO THINK THE THIRD SO WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AS A MULTI TIERED STRATEGY TO MOVE FORWARD. AND TO YOU I HATE TO USE A SPORTS ANALOGY BUT- YOU DO WANT TO LOOK AT JUST WHERE THE BALL IS TODAY BUT WHERE DO YOU NEED TO HAVE THE BALL DOWN THE ROAD. BUT I THINK TODAY WE CAN DEFINITELY GET WHAT PEOPLE CALL NEAR ZERO OR CULTURAL LOAD BOX TRUCKS- FURTHER OUT INTO USE. THAT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S NATURAL GAS WITH LOW KNOCKS ENGINES. THEY'RE MUCH LOWER THE 90% CLEANER THAN DIESEL. AND THEY CAN USE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS SO THEY CAN GIVE US. THE BENEFITS OF CLEANER AIR AS WELL AS CLIMATE ACTION. AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE NEED O HAVE AT THE SAME TIME A PARALLEL STRATEGY TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. ZERO WHICH MEANS NOTHING OUT OF THE TAIL PIPE. SO ZERO EMISSIONS FOUR CRITERIA MITTENS WITHIN THE REGION. AS WELL AS MOVING TOWARDS BECAUSE OF WHERE THE- UTILITY GRID IS GOING. ZERO EMISSIONS FOR CLIMATE AS WELL WE SHOULD BE. IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION APPROACHING EIGHTY PERCENT. A REDUCTION AND CLIMATE IN POWER PRODUCTION. SO THAT MEANS ANYTHING USING THAT POWER IS GOING TO BE EIGHTY PERCENT. LOWER ALREADY. AND THEN SIR MISSION DR TRAITS OR ELECTRIC DRIVE TRAINS ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN CONVENTIONAL DRIVETRAINS SO THEY WILL GET YOU EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. SO I THINK IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. SOMETHING THAT'S A LOW EMISSION COMBUSTION ENGINE. SUCH AS LOW KNOCKS NATURAL GAS NOW. GET THOSE OUT IN THIS INTERIM PERIOD BUT START THIS FILL IN THE GAPS. AS ELECTRIC MOVES ONLINE AND FRANKLY ELECTRIC IS GOING TO BE SCALING OVER THE NEXT. EIGHT TO NINE YEARS. SO IT'S A DUAL PHASE TRACK IF YOU WILL. I THANK YOU. AND I THINK WHAT YOU POINT OUT VERY SIMPLY JUST HAVING ELECTRIC TRUCK IS ENOUGH. THERE ARE MANY THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE IN THE HEAVY AND RIGHT NOW IF ANY. OF BUT YOU STILL NEED TO HAVE THE UTILITIES TO FEED THOSE TRUCKS. AND THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT DRAWS ON POWER- AND SO THERE IS NOT JUST THE TRUCK BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CHARGE THAT TRUCK. IF YOU'RE GOING. TO DEMAND THAT IT. ONLY BE ELECTRIC OR HYDROGEN AND SOME OTHER SOURCES OUT THERE MIGHT WORK. AS WELL HUNDRED TRUCK ACTUALLY IS ELECTRIC TRUCK RIGHT AND- IT'S A GENERATOR. BEING POWER BY ABSOLUTELY. IT'S THE SAME THING EXCEPT WHERE TO THE ELECTRONS COME FROM AND IN THE CASE OF A- FUEL CELL TRUCK- THE ELECTRONS ARE COMING FROM STORED HYDROGEN. THE THING GETS TURNED INTO ELECTRICITY BUT THE POWER TRAIN IS THE. EXACT SAME AS A BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCK. GREAT THANK YOU I WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE- WE DON'T TIME SHE KEEP YOUR YOUR CALL.
