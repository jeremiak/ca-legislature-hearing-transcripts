00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:50.667
THAT SENATOR DODD HAS BEEN

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:54.037
MAKING AMENDMENTS. TO MAKE THE

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:55.405
BILL MORE WORKABLE. I'D LIKE TO

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:57.140
RAISE TWO ISSUES TODAY THE

00:57:57.207 --> 00:58:01.344
FIRST IS IN SECTION ONE ONE SIX

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:03.580
NINE THREE ONE POINT ONE- SEE

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:05.748
THAT'S ON PAGE SIX. THIS

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:07.217
PROVISION WOULD HAVE THE FUND

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:09.853
EXPENDITURE PLAN IDENTIFIED THE

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.621
FUNDING NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:13.356
COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:15.758
HOUSEHOLDS EVIDENTLY ACROSS THE

00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:18.761
STATE IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:20.630
THIS PROVISION WOULD BE USED

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:23.800
FOR OVER HOW WE OPERATE. WE

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:25.068
THINK THERE IS A MORE EFFICIENT

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:27.003
WAY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.638
SUBSIDY UNDER THE PROGRAM

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:30.707
SHOULD BE WE HAD A MEETING WITH

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.575
THE DOCTOR STAFF AND SPONSORS

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:34.944
LAST- GET THE END OF LAST WEEK.

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:37.080
AND THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK ON

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:39.215
THAT ISSUE SO WE LOOK FORWARD

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:40.250
TO TRYING TO GET THAT ISSUE

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:43.253
WORKED OUT THANK YOU FOR THE

00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:44.420
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. THE

00:58:44.487 --> 00:58:47.023
SECOND ISSUE IS- REGARDING

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:50.059
SECTION ONE ONE SIX NINE THREE

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:52.028
ONE POINT ONE TWO. THAT HAS TO

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:54.330
DO WITH THE- PROPOSAL WHERE THE

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:55.698
P. YOU SEE WOULD DEVELOP A

00:58:55.765 --> 00:58:58.468
MECHANISM. FOR THE ELECTRIC AND

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.270
GAS CORPORATIONS TO SHARE THEIR

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:02.238
CUSTOMER DATA. AND WE

00:59:02.305 --> 00:59:04.007
APPRECIATE THAT- COMMITTEES

WORK IN THE OFFICE WORK ON THE

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:07.911
PRIVACY PART OF THAT. BUT- OUR

00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:09.312
CONCERN IS THAT WE THINK THE

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:10.914
STATE ALREADY KNOWS INCOME

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.583
LEVELS FOR HOUSEHOLD. SO IS

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:15.685
THIS REALLY NEEDED IT THANK THE

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:17.553
CONCERNED ABOUT CARE IS THAT

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.756
THE ENROLLMENT ELIGIBILITY DOES

00:59:19.822 --> 00:59:22.258
NOT HAVE RIGOROUS VERIFICATION.

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:23.426
SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:25.828
CORPORATE THERE SO WE SUGGEST

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:27.563
DELETING THAT PROVISION OR

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.532
LATER COVERS THE OTHER

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:01.896
TO HAVE THAT BALANCE SYSTEM

01:25:01.963 --> 01:25:04.165
