LIFE- AND THEN HER LIFE ACTUALLY

00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:48.244
GOT MUCH MUCH WORSE. HEADY ORTON

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:49.546

00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:52.449
TOWN OF. A RED TAG. WHERE SHE

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:53.650
ENJOYED A SAFE AND COMFORTABLE

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:56.453
CHILDHOOD. HIS FATHER SAMUEL WAS

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:57.620

BACKGROUNDS AND RELIGIONS. BUT

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:03.893
HER IDYLLIC CHILDHOOD STARTED TO

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.962
CHANGE WHEN SHE TURNED ELEVEN

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:08.398

THE LIVES LOST IN THE HOLOCAUST

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:44.447
TO START TO FEEL THAT THESE WERE

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:45.782
PEOPLE WHO LIVED A VERY LONG

00:59:45.848 --> 00:59:49.152
TIME AWAY AGO IN A PLACE THAT

00:59:49.218 --> 00:59:50.553
MUST BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.588
WHERE WE LIVE NOW. BUT ACTION.

00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:54.624
THESE HAVE HAPPENED IN THE TIME

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:55.692
OF OUR PARENTS AND OUR

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:58.394
GRANDPARENTS- MOST OF US HAVE

00:59:58.461 --> 00:59:59.996
HAD INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.431
BORE THE SCARS OF WHAT HAPPENED

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:04.500
IN GERMANY. AND GERMANY AT THE

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:06.970
TIME WAS CONSIDERED TO BE. NOT

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:09.605
JUST A CIVILIZED BUT AN

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:10.540
ENLIGHTENED COMMUNITY A

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:13.142
DEMOCRACY. AND YET THEY SLID

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:16.512
INTO. ONE OF THE WORST PERIODS

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:17.780
AND WORST ATROCITIES THAT

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.882
MANKIND HAS EVER SEEN NOT JUST

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.317
THE MURDER OF PEOPLE BUT THE

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:25.254
SYSTEMATIC FACTORY LIKE. PLANNED

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:28.992
EXECUTION OF MILLIONS OF MEN

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:32.595
WOMEN AND CHILDREN. IT'S SO

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.063
IMPORTANT THAT WE TELL SURVIVORS

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.832
STORIES NOT JUST WHILE THEY'RE

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.767
STILL WITH US AND THEY ARE STILL

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.602
WITH US AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.437
FOR YEARS TO COME BUT SO THAT

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:42.472
PEOPLE REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.841
AND ALWAYS REMEMBER. THAT WE ARE

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:46.509
JUST AS CIVILIZED AND WE ARE

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:49.712
JUST AS ENLIGHTENED. AND THAT

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.447
WITHOUT BEING DELIBERATE AND

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:53.683
INTENTIONAL. WE ALSO COULD

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:57.020
ALWAYS SLIDE INTO SOME SORT OF.

01:00:57.086 --> 01:01:00.289
ATROCITY ACTUATION WHERE WE ARE

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:01.791
SO WILLING TO DEMONISE OTHER

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.559
PEOPLE AND HATE OTHER PEOPLE

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.495
THAT WE ALLOW THE UNTHINKABLE TO

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:06.996
HAPPEN MAYBE NOT ON A GRAND

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:08.865
SCALE BUT EVEN ON A SMALL SCALE

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.933
AND WE CAN'T ALLOW. THAT TO

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.169
HAPPEN. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:14.971
SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:17.407
A **** REALLY IS WHAT THE

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:20.143
HOLOCAUST REALLY WAS. I MYSELF

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:21.944
WAS CALLED A **** BY PEOPLE AND

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:24.213
BULLHORNS JUST THIS YEAR OUTSID

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.282
THE CAPITAL. WHO THOUGHT THAT

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.484
ASKING PEOPLE TO WEAR A MASK OR

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:30.253
GET VACCINATED WAS THE SAME AS

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:32.055
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOLOCAUST

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.557
AND WE HAVE TO STAND UP AND SAY

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.592
THAT THAT ALSO IS INEXCUSABLE.

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.428
NOW WHEN I GRADUATED COLLEGE I

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:40.563
WAS OFFERED A JOB FROM A FRIEND

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.964

FAMILY WAS AFFECTED BY THE

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.447
HOLOCAUST AND- IT'S NOT A

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:45.815
TYPICAL STORY BUT I'M NOT SURE

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.683
THAT THERE IS A TYPICAL STORY

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.152
AND I THINK. AS YOU LISTEN. TO

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.355
THE STORIES TODAY THAT'S ONE OF

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:54.557
THE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED IS

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:55.558
THAT- EVERY STORY IS AN

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.326
INDIVIDUAL STORY EVERY FAMILY

01:04:57.393 --> 01:05:00.329
WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT-

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:02.365
BOUND TOGETHER BY THESE.

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:05.468
HORRIFIC EVENTS. MY MOM AND DAD

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:06.969
WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE BORN IN

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.838
THE UNITED STATES DUE TO THE

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:10.773
FACT THAT BOTH MY MATERNAL. AND

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.742
PATERNAL GRANDPARENTS MADE- VERY

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:15.177
PRESCIENT DECISION AND EMIGRATED

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:17.413
FROM EASTERN EUROPE NOT FAR FROM

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.850
FROM KEY FIVE BY THE WAY- IN THE

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:23.152
LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS TO ESCAPE

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:26.155
AN EARLIER PERIOD OF OPPRESSION

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:28.824
AND ANTI SEMITISM AND WE NEED TO

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:30.059
REMEMBER. THAT HISTORICALLY

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:32.295
HOLOCAUST CAME FROM SOMEWHERE

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:35.264
ALL OF THAT HATE DIDN'T JUST

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:37.767
SHOW UP IN AN INSTANT IT HAD

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:40.736
BEEN. GROPPER AND GROWING

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:44.273
LITERALLY FOR CENTURIES. BUT MY

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.308
GRANDPARENTS MADE THE RIGHT

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.076
DECISION BECAUSE THOSE RELATIVES

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:48.678
WHO STAYED BEHIND WERE LITERALLY

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.713
WIPED OUT ALONG WITH MANY

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.748
VILLAGES AND TOWNS DURING THE

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.517
COURSE OF THE HOLOCAUST I

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.752

SEVENTIES NOW MY MOM WANTED TO

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.182
RELATIVES. I'VE AND

FOR A PITTANCE AND HAD TO MOVE.

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:02.211
EVENTUALLY A DECISION WAS MADE

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:04.513
THAT FRANK HIS SISTER HIS

THEIR FAMILY AGAIN. EDUARD

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:22.965
CLINGING AS MANY DID TO THE

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.900
FALSE HOPE THAT THINGS WOULD GET

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:28.471
BETTER. REFUSED TO LEAVE. AND
