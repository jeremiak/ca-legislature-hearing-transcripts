WHO BELIEVE THAT WITH HOLDING AN EMPLOYEES HEALTH CARE WHILE I'M STRAIGHT IS APPALLING AND UNLAWFUL. THE COSBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC DEMONSTRATED UNMISTAKABLY THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS EVERYONE. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE ANY INCENTIVE TO EACH D. JACK PEOPLE FROM THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES. SHE DAMAGE TO THEIR FAMILIES AND TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION CAN BE DISASTROUS. ALLOWING EMPLOYERS TO WEAPONIZE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SIMPLY TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE IN LABOR NEGOTIATIONS IT'S NOT ONLY INCREDIBLY UNFAIR THAT DANGEROUS TO OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY. THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO EXISTING STATUTORY PROHIBITION AGAINST THIS. PUT SIMPLY IS AT AN UNFAIR DISADVANTAGE AND EVEN THE THREAT OF SUCH ACTION BY AN EMPLOYER STARTS TO WEAPONIZE HEALTHCARE AND THE RETENTION OF BENEFITS. THIS UNFAIR SCARE TACTIC SHOULD NEVER BE USED TO DISSUADE AN EMPLOYEE FROM THE EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. LEADERS MUST BE PROHIBITED FROM CONTINUING TO BENEFIT FROM THAT THE CREATURE'S BEHAVIOR. THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN IS AN IPORTANT STEP FORWARD TO ENSURING THAT ALL PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS CAN STILL RECEIVE INSURANCE DESPITE MAKING THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO GO ON STRIKE.

OKAY WE ARE A TO WITH THE UNANIMOUS VOTE THE BILL IS A BIGGEST AND THANK YOU. ONE OF THOSE YEARS FOR THE COMMITTEE TODAY. IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- YOU MAY PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. THANK. WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS OUR PENSION SYSTEMS ARE WORKING TO DO THEIR PART TO PROTECT PENSIONS HELLO PUBLIC SERVANTS. AB THREE SIX IS INTENDED TO GIVE WORST PUBLIC PENSIONS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS EVERY TOOL POSSIBLE TO INVEST AND MANAGE CALIFORNIA'S PENSION FUNDS. THIS BILL CREATES A PUBLIC RECORDS DISCLOSURE STRUCTURE TO ALLOW PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEMS LIKE CALPERS TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE INVESTMENTS IN THE PRIVATE LOW MARKET. IN THE SAME WAY YOUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS HELD CONFIDENTIAL BY YOUR MORTGAGE COMPANY THIS BILL SAYS THE PAY STRUCTURE TO PROTECT. THE BORROWER'S INFORMATION IF THE PENSION SYSTEM WITH CAPITAL THREE PRIVATE LOAN AGREEMENT. WITH THIS BILL FOR THE PAY STRUCTURE TO BRING THESE INVESTMENTS IN HOUSE RATHER THAN OUTSIDE FIRMS TO MANAGE THESE LOANS. DISCLOSURE STRUCTURE PROVIDES CERTAINTY FOR POTENTIAL BORROWERS BY BRINGING THIS WORK IN HOUSE CALPERS CAN SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN FEES THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO OUTSIDE FIRMS THE BILL'S PRICE RIGHT BILLS BETWEEN CONFIDENTIALITY NECESSARY FOR BORROWERS AND THE TRANSPARENCY REQUIRED THE PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEM. I ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AGREE TO HELP PUT THEM INTO PRINT GOING INTO THE NEXT COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE CHECK COMMITTEES WORKING WITH ME WITH ME TODAY ARE DANNY BROWN CALPERS LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIVISION CHIEF WHO THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND KRISTI PALMA PROPOSING. THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THANK YOU SOME IN WHO MOVED TO LEAVE THE SOME WITNESSED IN BROKE AT THE START. WELCOME A GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DANNY BROWN- FROM CALPERS. ABOARD INITIATION WHO ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. LET ME START BY THINKING THE AUTHOR- FOR HIS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA AND ALSO ALSO WANT TO THINK OF SENATOR CORTESE AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS- PRIVATE DEBT TRANSACTIONS OR INVESTMENTS BY THE PENSION FUND SERVING AS THE LENDER TO A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANIES SEEKING CAPITAL. FOR SUCH THINGS AS OPERATIONS OR GROWTH. CURRENTLY THE FUND MAKES THESE INVESTMENTS BY PAYING OUTSIDE FUND MANAGERS TO MANAGE TO THE TRANSACTIONS HOWEVER WHEN CALPERS YOU USES OUT SIDE OF FUND MANAGERS THEY PAY UP TO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. OVER FIVE YEARS FOR EVERYONE BILLION DOLLARS INVESTED. AB THREE EIGHTY SIX CREATES A DISCLOSURE STRUCTURE THAT WILL ALLOW CALPERS TO BRING SOME OF THIS MANAGEMENT OF PRIVATE DEBT INVESTMENTS IN HOUSE. AND SITTING ON THOSE EXTERNAL MANAGER FEES- THIS DISCLOSURE STRUCTURE IS ALSO MODELED AFTER CURRENT LAW. THAT'LL FOR EXTERNAL MANAGER SO WHAT REALLY ASKING FOR IS BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT EXTERNAL MANAGERS HAVE TO OUR INTERNAL STAFF. THIS WILL GIVE A BORROWER'S EXPECTATIONS WHEN THEY COME TO HELP THE SAME EXPECTATIONS THEY HAVE AN EXTERNAL MARKET WHEN THEY COME TO CALPERS. AND THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO ENTER THIS MARKET COMPETITIVELY AT THE- AT THE SCALE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE A SENSE. SO CALPERS AGREES WITH LEGITIMATE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC IN KNOWING HOW PUBLIC MONIES ARE INVESTED AS WELL AS THE OBLIGATION TO BE RESPONSIVE TO AN INFORMATION REQUEST. AND WE BELIEVE THE PROPOSED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS- BALLOTS EXIT EXISTING MARKET EXPECTATIONS WITH OF THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY FOR CALPERS INVESTMENTS AND SO WITHOUT A DOUBT FOR YOUR I. BOATS. OKAY THE FIGURES RON. BONJEAN AND WE WILL. ALSO COLIN CHRISTIE BOMA. AS A SUPPORT WITNESS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KRISTIE BELL HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY SIX WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT BY THE CHAIR ON THIS POLICY AND WHAT IS GREAT IS REASONABLE AND GRANTING PROTECTIONS THAT APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURES THAT'LL ALLOW CALPERS TO ENSURE THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM COMPATIBLE DATA QUICKLY COMPLETE COMPETE SORRY. FOR SOUND INVESTMENT IN THE PRIVATE MARKET WE THINK THE BILL IS SUPPOSED TO BE AMENDED STRIKES A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE RIGHT OF THE PUBLIC TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE PENSION SYSTEM BUSINESS. AND THE RIGHT OF THE PENSION SYSTEM'S EXERCISE THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND MANAGING THE ASSETS OF THE SYSTEM. THE FUND THE RETIREMENT. OF OUR MEMBERS. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS HARD WORK AND RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB THREE EIGHTY SIX. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY WE WILL MOVE TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM AND ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE EIGHTY SIX. YES E. V. MEASUREMENTS ZERO COMMENTS AT THE LIMITED OF COURSE TO. THE FORUM MEMBERS JERRY BROWN ABOUT HALF OF THIS YEAR YOU CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN NEUTRAL TO THIS POINT BUT WITH THE AMENDMENTS- WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL GOING FORWARD THANK YOU- MARCHI FOR US IN THE CALPERS STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IS VERY COMPLICATED. PRECIADO IT BUT- WE CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL AND THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE SIX SEEN ON WILL CHECK YOUR FULL ROOM- THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO TESTIFY WILL GO THE MODERATOR. MODERATOR OF PLEASE QUEUE UP ANY SUPPORT WHEN THIS IS ON AB THREE EIGHTY SIX AND AGAIN WOULD APPRECIATE KNOWING THE NUMBER WITNESSES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE EIGHTY SIX YOU MAY PRESS ONE. AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE ONE PARTY IN THE QUEUE NINE ONE TWENTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BILL GIVEN FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AND THERE ARE NO FURTHER PARTIES IN THE QUEUE. OKAY THANK YOU MODERATOR HOMES WE WILL. AND THEN TO- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION INTO WE DO HAVE BOTH DAVID SOARES AND JANET WITNESSES- MISTER SORES ARE YOU BILL WILL TESTIFY. I DON'T THINK YOU CHAIRMAN. ARE YOU MAY PROCEEDS. IN AFTERNOON I'M DAVID SORENSEN FIVE WITHIN SANTA CRUZ FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS AND I'M A CALPERS BENEFICIARY RETIRED AFTER SERVING FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS AS A PROSECUTOR IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. CONSECUTIVE TERMS REPRESENTING BOTH THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND THE PROSECUTORS IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE RETIRED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THE RETIREE FULLY SUPPORT CALPERS MAKING EFFORTS TO KEEP A LID ON CURRENT CONTRIBUTION RATES BUT WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THE PUBLIC TRUST FUNDS NOT BE PLACED INTO THE SORT OF NON TRANSPARENT INVESTMENT THAN IN THE RECENT PAST SAID THE FORMER CALPERS CEO TO FEDERAL PRISON. BILL PURPORTS TO ENABLE DIRECT LENDING OF TRUST FUNDS TO PRIVATE BORROWERS BUT GOES TOO FAR BY EXEMPTING THE CONSTITUENT OWNERS OF THE BAR OR THE LOAN TERMS AND THE COLLATERAL OF PLEDGED FROM THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. CALPERS ALREADY INVEST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ONE POINT 4% OF THE TRUST FUND AND PRIVATE DEBT THROUGH ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS. WHICH THEY LACK THE EXPERTISE TO MAKE INTERNALLY. THE FEES THEY PAY TO INVEST IN PRIVATE THAT MAKE UP A SMALL PART OF THE EXTERNAL MANAGEMENT FEES FROM ALTERNATIVES AND REAL ESTATE WHICH THEMSELVES MAKE UP A MERE CALPERS HAS UNDER MANAGEMENT. LOOKING AT CALPERS PROJECT TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET THESE EXTERNAL MANAGEMENT FEES AS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT PROFIT SHARING IS REPORTED IN THE LATEST CAPPER. WILL EXCEED ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AN INCREASE OF THIRTY PERCENT. THIS IS ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ABOVE ALL OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDING SALARIES AND BENEFITS INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANTS AND FACILITIES. PUT YOUR MAKE UP JUST SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ONLY INCREASED BY 3% THIS APPARENT MANIA FOR HANGING EXTERNAL TEAMS MIGHT NOT SUGGEST THE CALPERS LEADERSHIP ARE BEING SERIOUS ABOUT REDUCING CAN BE OF THIS DIRECT LENDING PROGRAM. THIS IS ESPECIALLY POINTED OUT BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE SUDDEN RESIGNATION OF THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS REVEALED IN THE MEDIA THAT HE HAD SERIOUS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH SOME OF THE SAME HEIGHT THE EXTERNAL MANAGERS. ALL ONE WITH THE RESIGNATION OF THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER WAS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CALPERS AND THE CALPERS BOARD PRESIDENT. ADMITTED TO BLOOMBERG NEWS THAT THEY HAD CHOSEN TO COVER UP G. I. O.'S CONFLICTS THE MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION FROM THE F. DTC AND FROM THE PUBLIC. WHEN STATE CONTROLLER BETTY YEE DEMANDED AN INVESTIGATION THE BOARD PRESIDENT TOOK THE MATTER INTO CLOSED SESSION LAST AUGUST AND NEVER REPORTED OUT. NOW CALPERS WANTS TO EXEMPT IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT COULD REVEAL SIMILAR INSIDER DEALINGS FROM THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. WELL WE COULD FULLY SUPPORT EXEMPTING PRIVATE BUSINESS INFORMATION DISCLOSED DURING THE UNDERWRITING PROCESS. THIS CAVALIER ATTITUDE BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND THE BOARD PRESIDENT FORD SERIOUS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. POSES IN A COMPELLING WAY THAT WE CANNOT TRUST CALPERS TO JUMP. THE CONSTITUENT OWNERSHIP OF A PRIVATE BORROWER THE LOAN TERMS AND THE COLLATERAL PLEDGED FROM THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY SIX GOES TOO FAR AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND SHOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD IN ITS CURRENT FORM. BUT ALSO LIKE IN CLOSING TO NOTE THAT THERE WAS A VERY STRONGLY WORDED LETTER SENT FRIDAY BY DOCTOR. THICK TO RECORD ALL THE CITY OF PASADENA IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. PREDICAMENTS SOARS JANET **** AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY. YES I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES AND YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

OKAY THANK YOU MODERATOR AMONG THE COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND- IF I CAN THE- TEST- MAKE MY COMMENTS FOR SAY A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE A SUMMER COOPER YOU'RE A WILLINGNESS TO- AGREED TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT BEEN NEGOTIATED- JUST RECENTLY- BETWEEN ARCED COMMITTEE STUFF AND- IN YOURSELF YOUR OFFICE. IN IN- IN TERMS OF LEAD US SUPPORT THE RESEARCH ALSO REFERENCE TO PLEASE- AMENDMENTS- BECAUSE THEY'RE RELATIVELY LATE COMEDIAN I JUST WANTED TO PUT ON THE RECORD MY UNDERSTANDING AND ASSUMING THAT. YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS THE SAME I THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO. RIGHT THE TO GET THAT OUT HERE ON THE RECORD- IN A IN A DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE ON THE DAIS HAVE RECEIVED. A MOCK UP OF THE AMENDMENTS- HAS UNDERSTOOD AND- AS NEGOTIATED THEM WITH COMMITTEE STAFF- WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS DO. IS NARROW THE BILL BY DELETING PROVISIONS THAT EXEMPT FROM THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT MATERIALS OR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE IDENTITY OF CONSTITUENT OWNERS. AS WELL AS COLLATERAL SO THAT THOSE CATEGORIES ARE STILL SUBJECT TO P. R. A. DISCLOSURE- THESE AMENDMENTS WILL BE TAKEN IN SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN ACTUALITY BECAUSE OF THE BILL'S DOUBLE REFERRAL IN THE TIMING OF THAT I WAS JUST REFERENCING. BUT I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR. THAT IS TO MY VOTE THESE ARE- A CONDITION. AND I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO PULL BILL BACK TO COMMITTEE AT A LATER TIME SHOULD THE BILL BE AMENDED A WAY THAT DOES NOT REFLECT OUR AGREEMENT TODAY AGAIN ASSUMING THAT WE HAVE AGREEMENT THE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I'D I DO THINK THAT. MUCH OF WHAT THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES. ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS. REAL AND LEGITIMATE. IN PERHAPS DESERVES SOME FURTHER ARTICULATION CERTAINLY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND- I WOULD JUST ASK YOU AS THE AUTHOR. TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO THE OPPOSITION THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. UP TO CONTINUE MOVING IN IN WHATEVER DIRECTION. OF MIGHT LEAD TO SOME MORE DETAIL IN TERMS OF WHAT THE- WHAT ELSE MAY BE SUBJECT TO. THE KIND OF TRANSPARENCY THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE ARE USED TO UP AT OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AT THIS POINT SO HI I WILL STOP THEIR IN ASKING IF THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS- FIVE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE CENTER ALERT. ON FIFTY S. I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THE FIRST ONE MIGHT BE TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT JUST HAPPENED BECAUSE- I CAN READ HE TEXT. AND I SORT OF HEARD WHAT YOU SAID. BUT HOW SPECIFICALLY TO THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESSED THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION I MEAN HOW DO THEY MOVE TOWARD IT. WHAT IS HIS BEST SEVERAL TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND- IT CERTAINLY OF THE AUTHOR WISHES TO HELP ANSWER THAT QUESTION- THAT'S FINE. BUT IT'S HIS PREROGATIVE BUT- I WOULD SEE. ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS BEAST. THIS IS THE ART TO OF WOOD I WOULD ENUMERATORS ABOUT SIX. SUBSTANTIVE CONCERNS ENUMERATED CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION BUT THE ARTS ARE TWO THAT HAVE BEEN FULLY RESPONDED TO IN TERMS OF- THEIR DESIRE FOR TRANSPARENCY SO THIS LITERALLY TAKES. A TO PERHAPS PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT A MATTER OF OPINION BUT TWO OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. REQUEST THEY HAVE MADE- AND AN AMENDED THEM SIR WHICH I WOULD THINK WOULD BE TO THEIR SATISFACTION CERTAINLY TO MY SATISFACTION NOW- WHAT ELSE. COULD BE DONE I THINK IS A SECOND QUESTION THAT I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO REFER TO THE AUTHOR. AND WHEN WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION NONE OF THE OPPOSITION AND- THE AMENDMENTS YET SAID CORRECT. HI THERE THERE WAS LITTLE TIME. THE IS IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS- GIVEN THE DAY OF THE WEEK IN- WHERE WE ARE ON THE TIMELINE- TO SPEAK TO EVERYONE- ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE- BUT THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS OF OUR P. E. A. WHO WERE AWARE. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE GRATEFUL OF THE MOVEMENT- THAT WAS MADE AT THIS POINT TO. YOU KNOW AFTER. I THINK THE MANY WEEKSOF WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN HIS OFFICE AND- AND ALSO OUR COMMITTEE MORE RECENTLY. THANK YOU ARE NOT AT AND SOME OF US ARE SMILING UNDER MASS AT THE FACT THAT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE COULD DO FOR THE WORKERS WERE ALL MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SO WE- SEE THIS CONTINUING TO COME OUR WAY- I WAS GONNA ASK A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WASN'T CLEAR FROM READING THIS. IS AWARE WITHIN THE PER SYSTEM INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE SO- THERE ARE TWO INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE PERS. BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR A PERSON VESTMENT COMMITTEE. ARE SUB COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. SO THAT THERE'S SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SYSTEM I MEAN PEOPLE ARE LIKE THEM. FOR TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY. UNDER THIS BILL WOULD THERE BE ACCESS TO PURCHASE MORE MEMBERS OF THIS INFORMATION SENATOR ON THAT MISTER BROWN IT'S THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR LAYERED- YES THAT THAT THE QUICK ANSWER IS YES THE PERS BOARD MEMBERS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO ANY INFORMATION THAT- INVESTMENT STAFF HAS IN THEIR POSSESSION AND OUR INVESTMENT COMMITTEE IS A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. SO BASICALLY THERE WOULD BE A MEASURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY IF UNDER THIS BILL IT IS NOT MADE PUBLIC IT IS MADE KNOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE PURSE BORDER ACCOUNTABLE TO THE MEMBERS TEN IS THAT CORRECT. WELL THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING CORRECT IT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM IF THEY REQUESTED TO VIEW IT. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AUTOMATICALLY DISTRIBUTED TO EACH BOARD MEMBER BUT THE BOARD MEMBERS COULD REQUEST TO BE COME INTO COME INTO THE BUILDING AND LOOK AT IT WHILE. MMHM THIS HEARING TO PUBLIC RECORD PEOPLE COME BACK AND READ WHAT JUST GOT SAID HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NOT NEVER HAPPENS AND IF SOMETHING WERE TO GO SIDE WAYS AND INVESTMENT AND NOBODY EVER KNEW TO THE REQUESTED THAT THAT'S NOT THE ACCOUNTABILITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- I DON'T. HAVE ASSIST YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SPECIFICALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION WROTE THAT I KNOW THAT I'VE TAUGHT MY HEAD I HAVE MICE CO IT HERE I HATE TO BRING HER UP BUT SHE MAY HAVE MORE NO LET'S DO THIS- IT'S COMING TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BY THE TIME OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU GET THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION SO THAT WERE REALLY CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK THAT. HE IS THE OPPOSITION. COMMENTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND IF ACCOUNTABILITY DOESN'T FACT EXIST WHAT'S UNDERSTAND HOW IT EXISTS AS IT COMES IN FROM. THE AREA BECAUSE IF IT'S THAT. THERE MIGHT BE. SOME CONCERN ABOUT MALFEASANCE BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT WHERE IT IS TO ASK WHERE IT IS THAT MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE A GOOD THING. BUT IF. THEY CAN DO A RANDOM SELECTION OR UNDERSTANDING OR SOMETHING THAT THAT GUARANTEES THAT THERE WILL BE ACCOUNTABILITY BACK WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT. SO ARE IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT YOU. YOU PROVIDE AN ANSWER TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER SEN PROBABLY COPY THOUGH LABOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS BEFORE THE JUDICIARY HEARING. KISS OF THE WAR AWARE OF THAT. AND FRANKLY. IF IT'S UP TO SAID ANYWAY IT WILL BE PURSUED DURING THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HERE. OKAY THANK YOU. IT IS AN EARLY SENATE ROSA. YES- ALONG THE LINES OF- WHAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST LAID OUT AS FAR AS- THE BOARD MEMBERS KNOWING NINE WHEN DID THEY KNOW IS IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE YOU COULD DO IT NOW OR YOU COULD DO IT LATER BEFORE I JUDICIARY WE COULD SUMMARIZE ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE. THE TRANSPARENCY THAT'S NEEDED FOR US TO BE CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE NOT JUST PUTTING INTO A DARK HOLE AND SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW. OUR RETAINS CONTROL AND MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT THIS- THAT'S KIND OF WHAT HAPPENS. A LOT OUT THERE IN THE WORLD ESPECIALLY. YOU KNOW IN ON WALL STREET- AND WE WANT OUR FUNDS TO BE- HM PROTECTED ENOUGH- I TAKE ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE IN SUPPORT. I HAVE ENORMOUS CREDIBILITY WITH ME I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING OUT AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR OUT FOR. THE WELL BEING OF THE FUNDS AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA DEPEND ON THOSE FUNDS FOR THEIR RETIREMENT- SO THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME- BUT I STILL THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO. HAVE THOSE SORT OF STEP BY STEP HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE THERE IS- ENOUGH OF AN ACCESS. THAT THERE'S REAL- SUPERVISION OF THESE FUNDS THANK YOU. DEGREE LOOKING FOR RESPONSE AT THIS TIME OR UPON THE CLOSE OF. THE DEAL WILL ALLOW YOU TO RESPOND TO THE EXTENT YOU WISH. AT THE TIME YOUR CLOTHES ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SERVICE SO I AM- NOTON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SO THIS WILL BE MY LAST. BITE AT THIS APPLE. INTO IF I MAY AND I THINK MANY WAS HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WITH THE OPPOSITION LAST WEEK- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PRECEDED THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED. WELL WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY. VENTURA IF MR SOURCES STILL ON THE LINE IF I MIGHT ASK HIM. TO RESPOND TO THE PROPER AMENDMENTS SO FAR JUST TO GET. A PLACE HOLDER FOR MY VOTE BUT I TYSON FOR THE LARGEST CHRISTIAN JUDICIARY THAT WILL FOLLOW WHAT PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION THEN- HOPEFULLY. BY TIA OR WHOEVER DOES THAT CAN GET HIM ON A- BUDGET ELDERLY JUDGES NEWMAN I HOPE I'M STILL ON THE LINE NO WE CAN ONLY. AND CLEAR SO WHAT CENTER NEWMAN POSES QUESTION I DIED HOPEFULLY THAT WAS CLEAR TO AYE IF YOU COULD MAJORITY YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE ARE CONVERSATION LAST WEEK- AND IT PROVED THAT CONVERSATION PROCEED THE AMENDMENTS. WERE DISCUSSING TODAY SO IF WE CAN GET YOUR REACTION- AT LEAST AT THE CURRENT TIME. AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE. AMENDMENTS MEET YOUR CONCERNS IF AT ALL. BOB WELL THERE IS THERE'S MAKE PROGRESS- CENTER NEWMAN THIRD THEY'RE BASICALLY THERE ARE SIX EXEMPTIONS- TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT- IN THE PROPOSED. BILL WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WE OF THOSE EXEMPTIONS TO WERE ADDRESSED BY THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. THE ONES THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT MET BY THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT OR- THE IDENTITY OF ANY CONSTITUENT OWNER OF THE BAR WORK. AND THE- DEEP INSIDE I WROTE IN MY- NEWSLETTER ARTICLES OF EUROPEAN SUGGEST AGAINST IN MY TESTIMONY IN THE ASSEMBLY- YOU KNOW THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE'S A COMPANY THAT'S OWNED BY SOMEBODY- AND THIS WOULD JUST. THE BILL AS AS WRITTEN WOULD NOT ALLOW DISCLOSURE AND THE OWNER AND I SUGGESTED THE COMPANY WHAT IF IT WAS PUMP JACK IN. NO ONE DISCLOSED THAT. GAVIN NEWSOM BONES PUMP JACK NOT THAT IT'S A BIT. THE GOVERNOR WOULD AVAIL HIMSELF OF THIS TYPE OF SITUATION. ON THE OTHER IS- THE COLLATERAL OFFERED FOR THE LOAN IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE OBVIOUSLY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE THESE LOANS. WOULD BE FAIRLY LONG TERM AND WOULD BECOME ASSETS HELD. BY A PUBLIC TRUST FUND IN OF COURSE WE WOULD WANT TO KNOW ANYONE WOULD WANT TO KNOW HOW THOSE. LOANS WOULD WERE SECURED- BECAUSE COLLATERALS ALWAYS CONCERNED ANY TIME- THAT THERE'S LANDING- ISSUE THAT IS NOT A- THE THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THE TRONG. OF LONG I'M NOT REALLY IS A VERY BASIC IT'S TO YOU KNOW HOW HOW IS THIS AMONG LAST FOR WHAT'S THE REPAYMENT SCHEDULE- WHAT'S THE INTEREST RATE. AND WE REALLY WE DON'T SEE WHY THAT HAS TO BE THE EXAM. WHAT WE DO AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT IS IT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO GET ANYONE. TO TRIED TO BORROW FROM CALPERS ASSUMING THAT CALPERS COULD EVEN GET COMPETENT STAFF TO DO UNDERWRITING- IF THEY HAD TO DISCLOSE- AN OPEN THEIR BOOKS- AN OPEN THERE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE MEETINGS THAT OF THE COMPANY NOT NOT CALPERS- TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY UNDER THE T. R. A. M. AND WE CERTAINLY. CAN SUPPORT THOSE OTHER THREE EXEMPTIONS AND YOU KNOW WOULD BE HAPPY WITH YOUR OPPOSITION IF THAT'S WHAT WAS ALL ALL THAT WAS IN THE BILL. BUT OUR CONCERN IS THAT IF WE- IF THIS BECOMES AN ASSET HELD BY A PUBLIC TRUST FUND. AND IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE G. P. R. A. WHAT THE TERMS ARE HOW THIS IS GOING TO GET REPAID- WITH THE INTEREST RATE IS THAT CETERA- IT'S REALLY STILL KIND OF. HOLLOW BUT I I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT SOME POLITICIANS BEING MADE BECAUSE WE OFFERED- IN AMENDMENT- SOME TIME AGO- THROUGH THROUGH- DANNY BROWN WHO WAS GREAT- IN- TALKING WITH US BUT- COULDN'T BRING HIS BACK A GOOD ANSWER- JUST SUGGESTING THAT THESE THREE AREAS OF CONCERN BE REMOVED. BUT ALLOWING PRIVACY OF THE UNDERWRITING PROCESS BECAUSE- WE GET WHY BORROWERS- WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST OPEN YOUR BOOKS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT GET THE LOAN AND THEN THERE ARE STILL- SUBJECT TO SHOOT YOUR AGE SO- I THINK THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS BUT I THINK WE'RE STILL VERY VERY CONCERNED- THAT THE TERMS. I'M. NOT BE EXEMPTION P. R. A. I. THE APPRECIATE THAT SIR JOHN PLAY TO HEAR THE WE ARE MAKING. AND HOPEFUL THAT WE CONTINUE. THIS CONGRESS AND MAKE IT PROGRESS IT MOVED SO THANK YOU MISS. THE CONSIDERED CENTER ALERT. SORRY I'M JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT LONG BY PLAYED MAYBE ASK THE AUTHOR. BECAUSE IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WERE THREE MAJOR ISSUES AND TO ADDRESS BY AMENDMENTS AND THEN THERE'S ONE MORE IN THE LONG TERM SO HOWEVER IT WAS DESCRIBED. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON WITH THE OPPONENTS IS THAT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THAT THERE'S A PLACE TO GO IS THIS MOVES TO JUDICIARY CHIPSET I THINK PIECES IN THERE I'M HAVE MISTER BROWN ANSWER THAT. HI I CENTS CONVERSATION WITH THEM- I THINK YOU DAILY RUN TO GIVE CALPERS AYE AYE WHAT I WOULD POINT OUT AS WE DID HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS I THINK. IN IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS THEY WERE LOOKING FOR US TO EXEMPT THE ENTIRE LOAN AGREEMENT WHICH I THINK WE- YOU KNOW COULDN'T. COME TO THAT AGREEMENT- BUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW WE ARE DISCLOSING A NUMBER OF THE TERMS OF THE LOAN THERE IN THERE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOAN. THE INTEREST RATE THAT WE'RE RECEIVING YOU KNOW THE ANNUALIZED RETURNS SO THERE'S INFORMATION IN THERE I THINK THE ONE PIECE THAT'S PROBABLY MISSING IS THE DURATION OF THE LOAN BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING. WE COULD PROBABLY WORK ON A AND- AND DISCLOSE BUT I THINK IT'S THE ENTIRE LOAN AGREEMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME COVENANTS AND THINGS IN THERE THAT THE POWER WAS NOT GOING TO WANT. OUT THERE FOR COMPETITIVE REASONS. FOUR WELL I WOULD JUST SUGGEST WITH THE ONE THING YOU SAID STILL MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE THERE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND SEE IF. BY THE TIME YOU GET TO JUDICIARY THERE'S AN AMENDMENT THAT THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT THERE BUT- THAT WOULD ADDRESS IN SOME MANNER THE THREE MAJOR POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE N. ANYWAY THANK YOU IT AND I WOULD JUST MAKE AS A COMMENT. THE ED. I READ ALL THIS I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING AT BEST I CAN AND IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE SIDE BARS THAT HAD IN RELATION TO THESE AMENDMENTS THERE WAS THE DISCUSSION THAT THIS IS STILL COMING TO JUDICIARY AND SO I THINK THAT THERE STILL CAN BE SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT ADDRESS DID NOT COMMITTEE BUT THIS IS PROGRESS OF THE AMENDMENTS AT THE COMMITTEE HAS HAS WORKED ON HERE SO. I AM WILLING TO VOTE TO MOVE ALONG IN AND JUST TAKE AT FAITH THE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. ON THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES. THANK YOU SENATOR WORD AND- AND I THINK THOSE LAST- QUESTIONS OR- SORT OF SORT OF GOOD EXAMPLES IT'S NOT TYPICAL OF THE WHAT I'M CALLING ARTICULATION OR DETAIL IS SAID THE BILL DIDN'T REALLY COME INTO OUR COMMITTEE ORIGINALLY WITH THAT KIND OF DETAIL BUT THE KIND OF DETAIL THERE'S THEIR WAYS TO DO IT WITHOUT- WITHOUT HIM IN SOMETIMES IN TERMS OF WE'LL UNDERSTAND WITHOUT EVEN CROSSED HAVING THE INFORMATION YOU KNOW TO KNOW HOW MANY LOANS. ARE OUT THERE WHAT TERM SUPPORT DURATION AND HAVE A SEPARATE LIST OF WHO THE CONSTITUENT OWNERS ARE WITHOUT COSTA DILUTION DOESN'T OUT ANYBODY ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY HAD TO SHOWS- THE REAL INVESTORS- WHICH ARE- HE KNOWS BOTH THE CALPERS RETIREES SICKENING IN THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING- WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE YOU KNOW IN IN SEPARATE COLUMNS IN A SPREADSHEET FASHION SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THINGS- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE- I KNOW THE AUTHORS BUT- TAKING ON A BIG. THE LEADERSHIP ROLE TO TRY TO GET THIS WORKED OUT WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE- IN RECENT TIMES IN A WEEK YOU PROBABLY WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AND GET OUT YOUR OTHER BILLS SO WE'RE GONNA ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU IN IN YOUR STAFF COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL YOUR HELP AND ALL THE COMES FROM THE CENTERS. YOU RECOGNIZE THE BIG ISSUES WITH THE- THE RETIREES YOU KNOW WHAT I DID GET THAT- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR PENSIONS OR HOLD SECURE THE AVERAGE PENSION FOR A CALPERS RETIREES ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH BEFORE RETIREMENT IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY WE THE COULD BE PAYING RENT OR MORTGAGE UTILITIES PUT FROM YOUR TABLE SO WE WANT TO MAKESURE THAT- WE DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM- CALPERS SPENT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OVER FIVE YEARS FOR EVERY BILLION DOLLARS INVESTED IN PRIVATE INVESTMENTS THIS IS MEMBERS MONEY WHICH CANNOT BE USED TO STRENGTHEN THE RETIREMENT HEALTH THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE MONEY TO BE INVESTED AS THE PAYING AN OUTSIDE FIRM THE BILL ACTUALLY HAS A HIGHER TRANSPARENCY THRESHOLD THEY CURRENTLY EXIST.

THE CURRENT STRUCTURE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER EARNING FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR WOULD ONLY RECEIVE 60% OF THEIR WAGES THE LOWEST WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE FOR ANY MINIMUM WAGE WORKER IN THE COUNTRY. EVEN IF THEY'RE WORKING FULL TIME THE CURRENT RATE WOULD ONLY PROVIDE THEM ABOUT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH. BARELY COVERING THE AVERAGE RENT FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. PARENTS ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PAY THE BILLS THE PROGRAM DOESN'T PROVIDE FAMILIES ENOUGH TO LIVE ON ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN A FAMILIES ACTUALLY FACING INCREASED EXPENSES FROM A NEWBORN OR MEDICALLY FOR SERIOUS ILLNESS. THIS HOMER PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO AVOID FORCING WORKERS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BEING PRESENT AT HOME TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES IN TIMES OF NEED. ARE WORKING TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

IN A WRITTEN ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND PUT ON THE SHELF BUT THE ACTUAL ABILITY TO TAKE THIS LEAVE TO BE WITH THEIR- WITH THEIR CHILDREN SO. I THESE AGREE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE CENTER OF ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DAIS WELCOME BACK TO THE AUTHOR AND- I'M SORRY CENTER NEWMAN YES PLEASE JUST. JUST VERY QUICKLY I JUST WANTED TO ECHO. THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE GARAGE OF. MENU ASSEMBLY WILL BRING THIS BILL- AND FOR LOOKING OUT FOR WORKERS. YOU KNOW BOTH PARENTS. WHO HAVE WHO HAVE EARNED THE RIGHT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND ACTUALLY WHERE WE BENEFIT- IN MANY WAYS FROM GIVING THEM THE RIGHT SHOULD THANK YOU BUT IT'S WORTH BUILT IT- THANK YOU- AND NOT. AS A RESTORING THE CITY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND POLITICOS YOU MAY AT THIS TIME. M. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION ON EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN A VARIETY OF A AND PROTECTED FAMILY LEAVE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS AND EARLY ON- THE CONCERN OF OUR OFFICE AND CONTINUES WE ARE CONCERNED. IT IS YES YOU CAN EXPAND THE NUMBER OF WEEKS AND THAT WORKS FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO SUBSIDIZES BAD. A FAMILY LEAVE. THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO BE THAT WORKING FOLKS. THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD THE LEASE STILL PAY THE ONE POINT OTHER PAY ROLL INTO A FUND THAT THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO ACCESS. SO I ALTHOUGH I'M VERY PROUD AND HAVE. JOINED OTHER PINCIPLE AUTHORED AUTHORED. BILLS TO HELP THIS ADMINISTRATION EXPAND THE WAYS THEY THOUGHT PAID FAMILY LEAVE TO BE EXPANDED. IT WOULD BE AN INJUSTICE TO NOT CONTINUE THAT THIS YEAR. THANKS TO OUR BUDGET I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO EXTENDED THE FIFTY FIVE. THE SIXTY PERCENT. SIXTEEN SO CALLED 70% FOR ANOTHER YEAR- BECAUSE NOT WITH A SENSE ADDED THIS YEAR 55% ARE BUDGET HAS THAT LANGUAGE TO EXTEND IT. HOWEVER THE REALITY IS BECAUSE OUR MINIMUM WAGE WENT UP AT A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY FOR THE SEVENTY PERCENT. SO EVEN A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER IS ONLY GETTING 60% OF THEIR ACTUAL INCOME. THERE IS NO WAY I HAVE YET TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES. THAT HE ESPECIALLY SINGLE MOTHER WHO WHO IS BARELY MAKING ENDS WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE TIME OFF AT WORKING ON A MINIMUM WAGE JOB OR EVEN A LITTLE BIT MORE. SO I THINK THIS IS IMPERATIVE AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. AND IN THE FUTURE ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT IT TO THIS IMPORTANT BENEFIT THAT THEY'RE ALL PAYING INTO IT. WHAT LAST FOUR NINE THREE GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE DID WE HAVE A MOTION ON. THE BILL SENATOR ALSO MOVED IT- WILL MOVE TO A ROLL CALL VOTE. THANK YOU TO THE CONSULTANT. THE MOTION IS TO. BUT FIRST R REFER TO THE CAN ON APPROPRIATION. COURTESY HI. BUT DOES THE I OR TROUBLED BY. A TRAVEL GUIDE THE RUSSELL I. WRESTLE I LAYERED HI. THERE I NEWMAN HI. NEWMAN AYE THROUGH THE BILLS OF THE UNANIMOUS VOTE THANK YOU. NEXT ON OUR AGENDA IS AB ONE OH FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN IN THE WELCOME TO PRESENT AS SOON AS WE GET YOU ALL SET UP IN SENATORS HERE. WITH THE PODIUM SANITIZER SHOULD. SPEAK MORE APPROPRIATELY IDEAS. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS AFTERNOON DO YOU. MEMBERS IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON HI FIRST LIKE TO STATE THAT I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AND I THANK THE CHAIR IN HIS COMMITTEE STAFFER CONSULTING HAS CONSULTING TEAM WORKING WITH MY STAFF TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHEERS CONCERNS ARE KEEPING THE SPIRIT OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH INTACT WHICH IS TO SEE UPWARD MOBILITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. MEMBERS TODAY ARE PRESENTING AB ONE OH FIVE A BILL THAT IDENTIFIES AND REFORMS PROCESSES. THAT HINDER UPWARD MOBILITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS THE SACRAMENTO BEE HAS PUBLISHED A SERIES OF LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF AFRICAN AMERICAN EMPLOYEES. WORKING ORGANIZATIONS- SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. OUR CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM. AND THE OFFICE OF STATE PUBLISHING. ALL OF THESE INSTANCES HAVE A COMMON DENOMINATOR THERE ARE BARRIERS TO UPWARD MOBILITY AND INCLUSION. LAST YEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOM TOOK A BOLD STEP FORWARD BY SIGNING MY BILL AB NINE SEVENTY NINE WHICH REQUIRES EACH PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATION WHOSE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF DIRECTORS FROM UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITY. ON ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE GOAL WAS PLAIN AND SIMPLE WE NEED TO INCREASE UPWARD MOBILITY OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS WAS A PRAISE WORTHY STEP FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. HOWEVER THERE ARE PERPETUAL BARRIERS TO UPWARD MOBILITY THAT EXIST IN OUR PUBLIC SECTOR CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT I PUT FORWARD A NUMBER OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORMS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN AB ONE OH FIVE. DIVERSITY FOR STARTERS AB ONE OH FIVE CALLS FOR DIVERSITY ON ALL STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT HAVE VOLUNTEERS AS YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT BASED ON RACE GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION IN THE OPERATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. EDUCATION AND CONTRACTING. THEREFORE THE LEGISLATURE COULD NOT REQUIRE DIVERSITY REGARDING BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT SOLELY HAVE STATE EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE IS ALLOWED TO REQUIRE DIVERSITY ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WHERE THE BOARD MEMBER OR COMMISSIONER IS A VOLUNTEER. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CHAIR OF ALL INTO YOUR MEMBER OF COMMISSIONER OR COMMISSIONER IS DEFINED AS SOMEONE WHO IS SELECTED TO SERVE ON A BOARD OR COMMISSION WHO DOES NOT. WHO DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION OR FINANCIAL GAIN FROM ANY STATE AGENCY. A VOLUNTEER MAY RECEIVE PER DIEM AND A VOLUNTEER SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE AN EMPLOYEE SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF RECEIVING PER DIEM. AB ONE OH FIVE SIX SIX TO DIVERSIFY THE POSITIONS OF VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS AND COMMISSIONERS AS VACANCIES BECOME. AVAILABLE ADDITIONALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD ESTABLISH A PROCESS THAT INCLUDES DIVERSITY AND BEST PRACTICES IN EACH ASPECT OF THE DESIGN ANNOUNCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF EXAMINATIONS FOR THIS TALISMAN OF EMPLOYMENT LISTS. A DIVERSE PERSPECTIVE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE HIRING PROCESS PROVIDES FOR MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND BETTER OUTCOMES. AB ONE OH FIVE PROVIDES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES. DEVELOP MODEL UPWARD MOBILITY GOALS TO INCLUDE RACE GENDER AND LGBTQ AS FACTORS TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL EQUAL PROTECTION LAWS. MEMBERS THE INCLUSION OF THESE FACTORS ARE SIMPLY MEANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR DIVERSITY. I'M AWARE OF THE PROVISIONS OF TWO OH NINE AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT FALL VIOLATE. THE CONSTITUTION. THIS BILL ALSO GOES FURTHER TO INCLUDE. ISSUES OF INCLUSION. ADVERSE AN ADVERSE ACTIONS. MEMBERS OVER THE PAST YEAR ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION HAVE BEEN A TOP AREAS OF CONCERN NATIONALLY AND HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT HAS BEEN NEARLY A YEAR SINCE GOVERNOR BROWN'S REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR CIVIL SERVICE. COLLEGE ARE HAS PROVIDED US OVER SEVEN YEARS OF DATA THAT HIGHLIGHTS THAT THERE ARE PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT HINDERED UPWARD MOBILITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS BILL REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFINE TUNE OUR CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS A MANUAL I'M A FOR CO FOUNDER DIRECTOR ABOUT REACH COALITION OF BLACK EMPLOYEES AND CHRIS LOXTON. WITH THE COALITION FOR JUST AND EQUITABLE CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

I AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS I WORK WITH THE STATE FROM THREE TO THIRTY YEARS AND MOST AND THE MOST DISHEARTENING EXPERIENCES WE'VE HAD WE'VE SHARED BY THE INEQUALITY OF PROMOTION THE MISTREATMENT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND ALL STATE IMPLEMENT DEPARTMENTS. CRIED OUT TO OUR DEPARTMENT EXECUTIVES AS SECRETARY SO IN THAT CHANGE BUT OUR CRIES WERE THAT WERE DEAFENED BY THE LACK OF INTEREST TO MAKE CHANGES. REASONS WERE UNKNOWN BUT A SENSE OF PRIVILEGE EXISTED WITHIN THEM. THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF. NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WITH AN ANSWER. BUT THEN AFTER BUT WE ARE STILL WORKING THE MATH TO GET THE ANSWERS CORRECTLY. I'M CONSTANTLY PASSED OVER FOR PROMOTION I DO NOT SEE ENOUGH OF MY FACES REPRESENTING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF OUR LEADERSHIP. I'M NOT BEING UTILIZED EFFECTIVELY EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE MOST PROVOCATION EXPERIENCES. THESE ARE SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND STATEMENTS SEVEN SET BY OUR MEMBERS AND MANY PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE STATE OF FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS MOTIVATED BY AMERICANS LONG LASTING HISTORY OF RACISM. WHICH IS MORE OFTEN TO IMPLICIT BIAS IN SOCIETY AND ESPECIALLY THE WORK FORCE. THIS BILL IS ESSENTIAL TO THE ANSWERS FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. WE ASK THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY OUR PROVEN THIS BILL. NOT DOING SO IS EVIDENCE AS TO WHY IT IS STILL TAKING THIS FIFTY SEVEN YEARS TO SOLVE THE SIMPLE PROBLEM.

AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF AT TEN FORTY ONE WILL EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY MEMBER FOR PURPOSES OF FAMILY CAREGIVING AND SICK LEAVE TO ALLOW WORKERS TO TAKE TIME OFF TO CARE FOR QUITE A DESIGNATED PERSON. THIS COULD INCLUDE A FRIEND OR PARTNER. WHO CAN PROVE THAT THEIR- THEIR DEPENDENCY WITH A DOCTOR'S NOTE. TO THE MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS APART FROM THE NUCLEAR FAMILY MODEL OF A MARRIED COUPLE WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN. AND SAID THIS FAMILIES INCLUDE LOVED ONES WHO AREN'T BIOLOGICALLY OR LEGALLY RELATED DATA FROM THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY CENSUS BUREAU SHOWS THAT EIGHTEEN POINT 4% OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS. FOLLOW THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY STRUCTURE. CALIFORNIA FAMILY LEAVE LAWS CONTINUE TO REFLECT OUTDATED TRADITIONAL FAMILY MODELS ONLY ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO TAKE. TIME OFF TO CARE FOR NEARLY TO FIND MY FAMILY MEMBERS. THIS POLICY GAP CERTAINLY DISPROPORTIONATELY- IMPACTS THE LGBT Q. I COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA HAS THE FOURTH LARGEST LGBTQ I POPULATION THE U. S. MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY DO NOT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES. THERE FOR THEIR LIVES AND LESS LIKELY TO HAVE BIOLOGICAL SUPPORT AND RELY ON THEIR CHOSEN FAMILY INSTEAD. ANOTHER STUDY FOUND THAT THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES CAN BE FOUND IN NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES. TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKETS IT IS NOT UNCOMMON COMMON FOR RESIDENTS TO BE LIVING WITH COUSINS UNCLES AND OTHER RELATIVES NOT COVERED BY EXISTING LEAVE LAWS. SPECIFICALLY DURING COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT PRECEDENT FOR EXPANDING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND STATE AND LOCAL LAW AND REALLY MODERNIZING OUR LANGUAGE AND ENSURING THAT WE DON'T HAVE POLICIES THAT. ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACT CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. ORGAN CONNECTICUT NEW JERSEY IN COLORADO EIGHT LOCALITIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES HAVE SIMPLY PASSED SIMILAR SICK LAWS THAT COVER CHOSEN FAMILY. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO JOIN THESE OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS HAVE. THE RIGHT TO BE THERE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES WHEN NEEDED REGARDLESS OF THEIR BLOOD OR LEGAL RELATIONSHIP.

IMPORTANTLY EMPLOYERS MAY LIMIT WORKERS TO ONLY ONE DESIGNATED PERSON EVERY TWELVE MONTHS AND THERE'S JUST TWO OTHER IMPORTANT THING THAT LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ABOUT THE BILL. FIRST THE BILL DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW OR ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF LEAD TIME IT SIMPLY ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO USE THEIR EXISTING PAID SICK OR FAMILY LEAVE UNDER EXISTING LAW TO CARE FOR THE LOVED ONES WHO MOST DEPEND ON THEM TO MAKE THEIR FAMILY. SECOND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TAKE THIS LEAVE A SMALL BUT FOR THOSE PEOPLE BELIEVE IS LIFE CHANGING THE EDT REPORT THAT LESS THAN POINT CLEAN ARE TO CARE FOR AN EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER POINT 3% IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON BUSINESS. EMPLOY WHO NEEDED FOR IN HIS CAR. AND LIFE MANY. LAST I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HIGH. THE CALIFORNIA ALREADY. ON THIS ISSUE. YOU'VE HEARD THE FEDERAL. SIXTY EIGHT AND EIGHT LOCALITY.

GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU THE CONCLUDES OPPOSITION WITNESSES SO COMPACT COMMITTEE- FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CENTER DROUGHT SO I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR WOODS- QUITE SURPRISING TO ME IS. THE FAMILY VALUES THAT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT. AND WE HEAR ABOUT ALL THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR FAMILIES THAT YOU KNOW HAVE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER. THIS IS ABOUT UNPAID- THIS IS ABOUT UNPAID LEAVE SO HERE YOU HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER. OR A- THE NONTRADITIONAL FELLING FAMILY MEMBER WANTING TO TAKE CARE WHY BE THE CARE GIVER THAT'S NEEDED AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME. AND WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR SALARY IN ORDER TO DO THAT THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO THEM AND YET WE WOULD NOT PROTECT THEM UNDER THEIR CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT. FLOOR TO TAKE A COUPLE OF SIX PAID SICK DAYS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS RIGHT UHHUH. SO I- I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE YOU'RE BRINGING THIS UP AND I WOULD REALLY URGE THAT- WHOEVER'S ALL THE LIST OF. OF THE OPPOSITION WOULD. LOOK LIKE- EMPLOYERS ORGANIZATIONS ARE BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS TO RETHINK THEIR POSITION AND TO ALLOW THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE WILLING TO GIVE UP AND SACRIFICE SO MUCH. JUST THE TIME OFF THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR SO PRECIADO THANK YOU YOU REMEMBER SO CENTER ALERT. YEP FROM INTERESTINGLY- ARE IN OUR FLOOR DEBATE EARLIER TODAY- I TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT I HEADED AN AIDS SERVICE AGENCY THIRTY YEARS AGO RIGHT NOW. AND THAT THERE WERE. OUR FAMILIES THAT WERE BIOLOGICALLY RATE RELATED BUT THERE WERE NO RIGHTS OF THE SPOUSES AND THAT THEY WOULD COME INTO TOWN. AND TAKE HALF A HOUSE WHEN SOMEBODY PASSED AWAY EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE STRANGE THEY WOULD KEEP THE PARTNER FROM VISITING IN THE HOSPITAL. THERE WERE INCREDIBLE FUNCTION WHAT WE DID IS WE AS A GOVERNMENT ADMINISTERED PEOPLE RECOGNIZED WHAT WAS LACKING IN THAT AN EXTENDED PROTECTIONS AND MADE SURE THAT THINGS LIKE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN WITHIN THAT MORE TRADITIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF MARRIAGE OR OR TAX MEANT. AND I THINK THAT WHILE THAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL- OF MOVIE IT WAS RECOGNIZED ALSO ON THE FLOOR THAT NOW THERE'S EVEN A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS SUPPORT MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND A I THINK THAT THE COUNTRY MOVED TO WHERE THE JUSTICE WAS AND WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE IN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. WHAT I THINK THIS BILL DOES IS TAKE THE NEXT STEP BECAUSE THERE ARE EXACTLY. THOSE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT MIGHT BE NONTRADITIONAL BUT ARE REAL AND I HAD ONE IN MY FAMILY WHERE. MY BROTHER AND HIS PARTNER'S BEST FRIEND FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE DAY ENDED UP BEING HIS CARE GIVERS AT THE END AND DOING MANY OTHER THINGS AND WHILE THEY WERE PRIVILEGED IN A WAY THAT THEY DIDN'T. HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH THEY WERE IN A SITUATION THAT THIS BILL COVERS. ARE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO TAKE LEAVE WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO HELP THAT PERSON TO THE LAST MONTHS AND WEEKS OF HIS LIFE. AND SO V. E. R. I GET THAT THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD BE ABUSED BUT ACTUALLY. AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES SAID IT'S A SMALL NUMBER OF SITUATIONS AND IT IS REALLY MOVING TOWARD WHERE THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION REALLY IS AND SO- HIGHS ARE ARE. SALUTE TO A PERSON FOR BRINGING AT A RECOGNIZED THE CONCERNS IN THE OPPOSITION BUT I THINK JUST AS WE MOVED PAST AND UNDERSTOOD THE VALIDITY OF PASSED CHANGES WE'VE MADE. WE WILL FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT THIS ONE AFTER THE LAWN SANTEN AND GOES INTO SO ARE. WILL BE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THE NEW. YORK I CLEARLY SEE IN YOUR BLUE SPOT TODAY.
