ABOUT THIS SO I THINK -- THERE

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:46.599
HAS TO BE A BALANCE BETWEEN --

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:49.468
MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION AND

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.804
RENTERS TAX CREDIT WHEN WE LOOK

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:54.473
AT THE MAY LIEU OF OF THE PUBLIC

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.976
AND AND LOOK AT THE NEED FOR

00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:58.244
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I THINK.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.412
WHEN YOU LOOK AT --MORTGAGE

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.680

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.149
DEDUCTION.

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.783
WHICH IS GONE UP WITH THE

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.453
INCREASE IN VALUE OF PROPERTY.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.122
OF IN THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY I

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:12.024
THINK THAT'S OF NOT BEEN

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:13.659

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:17.463
INCREASES IN THE RENTER -- TAX

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.266

WE OUGHTA APPROACHES FROM A

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.569

THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO US.

TRYING TO MAKE IS IT DOESN'T GO

00:36:54.912 --> 00:36:56.013
FAR ENOUGH AYE.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.114
YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE WIPING OUT

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:59.784
THIS MINIMUM TAX IN I I I DON'T

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.219
KNOW HOW IT THIS BILL REALLY

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.654
DOES THAT I'LL VOTE FOR THE BILL

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:05.690
BUT BUT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:37:05.756 --> 00:37:06.457
IF.

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:09.560
YOU BENEFIT ONLY IF YOU HAVE.

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:10.761
A TAX LOSS THAT YEAR.

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:11.696
QUESTION WOULD BE DO YOU STILL

00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:14.899
GET THE KERRY BACK TO LOS. FOR

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:17.068
ALSO INCENTIVIZING INCORPORATION

00:37:17.134 --> 00:37:18.102
I MEAN THERE THERE THERE'S

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:19.937
MULTIPLE FACETS TO WHY THIS BILL

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:22.039
FIRST WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.774
THE MINIMUM TAX.

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:25.409
OF FAIR APPLICATION OF IT AND

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:26.544
WE'RE TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:28.779
INCORPORATIONS AT THE SAME TIME.

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:30.147
AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO HIT THE

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:31.349
SWEET SPOT.

00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:34.352
AND YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW. TO GET

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:37.722
A BIPARTISAN BILL ON TAXES IS TO

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:39.557
THE VERY NARROW SWEET SPOT.

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:40.558
OUR LORD WERE TRYING TO GET

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:42.760
THERE I GOT A SMIRK FROM LOOKING

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:43.561
SOMETHING SOONER PORTANTINO

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:45.396
BECAUSE WE WOULD LOVE TO TAKE

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:48.532
THAT AMENDMENT BUT IF YOU WANTED

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:49.934
TO OFFER THAT YOU KNOW.

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:51.268
THE CALL TO LIKE YOUR I WILL

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.204
TAKE YOUR AYE VOTE AND AND MOVE

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.639
IT ON BUT I I BUT I I I'M I'M

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:59.043
JUST THINKING A PRACTICE IT IT'S

00:37:59.110 --> 00:37:59.410
IT'S NOT GOING.

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:00.645
TO BE WHAT WE WILL.

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:02.346
REALLY NEED IS JUST GONNA BE

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:03.280
WITH YOU HAD A TAXABLE AUSTIN

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:03.981
YOU YOU JUST SAVE A COUPLE

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.149
HUNDRED BUCKS AND THAT'S NOT THE

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:06.150
BANG I'M LOOKING FORWARD SO I

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:07.885
APOLOGIZE.

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.021
FOR BEING A CPA ARE THANK YOU

00:38:10.087 --> 00:38:11.088

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.256
ELECTED IT REAL QUICK SO I'D

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:13.758
LIKE TO BRING CLOSURE TO THIS.

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:16.193
DISCUSSION HERE SO -- MA'AM IF

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.161

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:19.697
BRIEFLY PLEASE.

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:22.099
THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX IS

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:24.001
EVEN IF YOU HAVE A LOSS.

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:25.903
IF IN REVENUES YOU KNOW FOR THE

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.205
YEAR SO IT'S THE BASE.

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:31.142
YOU STILL PAY TAXES ON ON YOUR

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:32.810
GROSS EARNINGS.

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.612
IN ADDITION SO I DON'T THINK YOU

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.247
LOSE ANYTHING BECAUSE CURRENTLY

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:38.582
THEY'RE NOT PAYING ANYTHING.

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:39.717
ARE YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR EIGHT

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:40.751
HUNDRED EVERY YEAR REGARDLESS

00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:44.155
BUT ONLY 17% A SMALL BUSINESSES

00:38:44.221 --> 00:38:46.257
ARE INCORPORATED IN PAYING.

00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:48.559
AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS AT

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:50.227
LEAST 50%.

00:38:50.294 --> 00:38:50.928
ART.

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.129
BUT I'M SAYING THERE'S NOT GOING

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:55.366
TO BE A BIG SAVINGS UNDER THIS.

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:57.268
FORMULA AS I UNDERSTAND IT.

00:38:57.334 --> 00:38:57.902
AND SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:38:57.968 --> 00:39:01.772
HOW DO I SUPERCHARGE YOUR BILL.

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:03.307

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:23.632
WITH THE PERSON BUT THE FACT

01:08:23.699 --> 01:08:25.134
THAT THEIR EX OFFENDER ANDERS

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:27.470
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HIRING.

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:29.004
AGAINST PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEIR

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:30.439
EX OFFENDERS.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.241
SO I I'M I'M I'M TROUBLED BY

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:34.777
THIS [inaudible]

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:37.513
ADDED.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.381
I JUST TROUBLED BY THE ADDITIVES

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.484
AMENDMENT THAT WAS SUGGESTED

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.219
HERE AND I I DON'T KNOW IT'S A

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:46.755
VALID AMENDMENT -- I QUESTION

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:49.425
THE AYE AYE.

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:50.793
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S THERE IT

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:56.298
SAYS -- PEOPLE WITH THESE --

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:57.466
THAT EX OFFENDERS HAVE THESE

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.335
PROBLEMS -- I DON'T THINK THEY

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:00.970
HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THOSE THINGS

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:03.339
ANYMORE THAN NON EX OFFENDERS

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:03.639
[inaudible]

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.441
SO.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:07.843
WHY IT CAN YOU COMMENT CAN WE

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.278
TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT?

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.981
I I I I JUST I I I WOULD PREFER

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:13.382
NOT TO HAVE.

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:15.551
THAT AMENDMENT IF I WAS VOTING

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:16.752
ON THIS.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.120
I THINK THIS PUTS INNER ADDED

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:20.589
ADDED IMPEDIMENT ON THE PROGRAM

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.791
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:25.261
YOU KNOW I I AGEE WITH YOU THAT

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:31.133
THAT AMENDMENT PUTS -- OF THAT

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.735
IT MAKES AN ASSUMPTION THAT

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.670
SOMEBODY IS IMPRISONED FOR ONE

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:36.038
OF THOSE ISSUES YEAH THAT'S WHEN

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:39.141
A PART NUMBER AND AND FOR YOU

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:41.010
KNOW I WOULDN'T OF ADDED THAT

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:43.445
AMENDMENT MYSELF EITHER GIVEN.

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:44.980
THE BROAD RANGE OF OF REASONS

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:47.550
WHY PEOPLE GO TO PRISON BUT WHEN

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:50.953
I LOOKED AT IT -- IN SOME

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.755
INSTANCES THERE ARE PERCENTAGE

01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:55.624
OF THEIR SOME PROGRAMS ALLOW

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:59.194
PEOPLE OF THE POTENTIAL TO GET A

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:00.195
REDUCED SENTENCE OF THEY GO

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:05.301
THROUGH -- DRUGS -- EDUCATION OR

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:06.735
DRUG TREATMENT.

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:09.805
PROGRAM AND THAT IS THAT USUALLY

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.507
COVERS A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:13.776
POPULATION NOT EVERYBODY.

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:16.512
AND THE OTHER AMENDMENT HAD TO

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:20.282
DEAL WITH -- THE THE COGNITIVE

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:21.350
BEHAVIOR.

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:25.621
THERAPY -- AGAIN ARE THERE IS

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:29.391
SOME -- PEOPLE IN IN PRISON THAT

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:30.693
FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY AS WELL

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:34.663
AND THEY ARE ALSO WITHIN THE

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.066
SYSTEM REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH.

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:38.467
SOME KIND OF TREATMENT PROGRAM

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:42.137
THAT ALLOWS THEM -- TO ALSO

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:44.673
QUALIFY FOR A REDUCED SENTENCE

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.576
AND AND THEY ALSO -- OFFER THAT

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.511
WITHIN OUR PRISON SYSTEM.

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:50.512
BUT AGAIN WHAT IF YOU DON'T FALL

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:51.246
IN THAT.

01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:52.881
CATEGORY BUT THERE ARE OUR

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:54.116
PERCENTAGE.

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:56.385
I FELT I FIGURED THAT ON ENTER

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:58.420
ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AT THE

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:01.590
VERY LEAST WOULD DO ALMOST

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.459
ANYBODY SOME GOOD.

A PROBLEM OR NOT YOU YOU YOU

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.400
WOULD BE WELL.

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:14.503
SHOULD I AGAIN THESE ARE NOT MY

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:16.872
AMENDMENTS -- THE CHAIRMAN AS A

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.774
VERY INFLUENTIAL MAN AND AND AND

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:22.878
AND I I I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:25.014
THEY THEY THEY MAKE IT HARDER ON

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.348
THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT DO

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.716
NEED OUR HELP BUT AT THE SAME

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.518
TIME THESE PROGRAMS COULD BE

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:31.053
VERY HELPFUL.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.321
I I CAN IS COMMON RIGHT LOOK I

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:33.889
THINK THAT THE WHAT WE WERE

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.424
TRYING TO BE ABLE TO HIT.

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:38.994
IS BEING ABLE TO MOVE -- THE

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.262
INDIVIDUAL FORWARD.

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:41.463
AND IF YOU'RE COMING OUT OF

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.732
PRISON FOR EXAMPLE -- BEING ABLE

QUITE SOME TIME TO BE ABLE TO GO

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:48.070
THROUGH A WORK READING THIS

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.739
CLASS IS GONNA BE CRITICAL TO

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:51.674

CONTINUE THAT TREATMENT.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.549
OUT OF THE WALL -- IF YOU ARE

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.484
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ANGER

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.585
MANAGEMENT.

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:05.287
I'M TO BE ABLE TO PICK AND

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:06.855
CHOOSE FROM EITHER OF THESE

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.824
PROGRAMS -- IN IT IS SUPPOSED TO

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:10.893
BE ABLE TO HELP AN INDIVIDUAL

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:13.462
BROWN THEMSELVES OUT -- AND BE

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:16.398
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AFTER SOME

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.033
OF THE CHALLENGES IN MAY FACE.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.535
IT'S NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:21.170
BE A TO CREATE ALL OF THEM THAT

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.104
BEING ABLE TO PICK ONE OF THEM

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:22.938
THE BILL TO BECOME THAT

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.873
INDIVIDUAL WANT TO BE.

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.942
YOU WANT TO BE LONG TERM AND WE

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.111
BELIEVE THAT EACH OF THESE ARE

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:29.945
SELF HELP.

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.915
AN END TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:35.317
YOURSELF IN CANADA THE I THINK.

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:37.019
IN A MINIMUM EVERYTHING IN

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:37.953
REGARDS OUR WORK READING THIS

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.054
WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.622
ESTABLISH A WELL ROUNDED

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:41.657
INDIVIDUAL LONGER TERM.

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.525
BE MARKETABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:45.494
AS WELL THAT'S WHY WE ARE

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:49.465
ADVANCE THAT -- LOOKING AT THAT

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:52.201
WELL ROUNDED INDIVIDUAL --

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:53.102
MISTER CHAIRMAN.

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:53.869
OUR I BELIEVE THAT THESE

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.304
AMENDMENTS WILL ADD COSTS THAT

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:56.905
WILL BE TAKEN UP IN

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.574
APPROPRIATIONS.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.342
BECAUSE IT WILL INVOLVE COST TO

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:01.810
PAY FOR THESE.

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:02.845
PROGRAMS.

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:05.681
AND THE THEY WILL ALSO ADD DELAY

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:08.951
THE TO THE PERSON.

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.452
ENTERING IN THE PROGRAM.

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:12.387
BECAUSE THEY WOULD FIRST HAVE TO

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:14.656
COMPLETE THESE PROGRAMS PRIOR TO

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:17.226
BEING ENTERED INTO THIS PROGRAM.

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.460
SO I THINK I THINK THOSE ARE THE

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:20.262
IMPEDIMENTS I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:22.798
IT'S A BARRIER. FOR SOMEBODY

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.366
ENTERING INTO THESE PROGRAMS.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.668
SO -- AND ANNA ANNA AND I DON'T

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:29.204
KNOW WHAT EVIDENCE WAS USED.

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:30.873
TO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:31.173
[inaudible]

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:35.010
REGARDING -- THE COMPLETION OF

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.379
THESE PROGRAMS. FOR AN EX

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:39.114
OFFENDER TO QUALIFY. FOR TO BE A

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.016
QUALIFYING EMPLOYERS IN THE BILL

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.084
SO I AM.

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:44.553
I AM -- TROUBLED BY -- I WISH

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.822
THAT WE COULD -- HAVE THESE

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.690
AMENDMENTS RECONSIDERED AT SOME

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:49.391
POINT.

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:52.027
IF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE --

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.796
PUTS A IN ORDER BECAUSE I KNOW

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.564
THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:57.499
EXPENSIVE. FOR EXAMPLE.

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:59.301
THERE THEY WOULD TAKE A LONG

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:00.636
TIME YOU CAN'T JUST WALK INTO A

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:02.571
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM AND

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:04.273
LEAVE IN THIRTY DAYS IT TAKES

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:06.575
WHILE IT IS TIME CONSUMING

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:06.875
[inaudible]

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:12.714
IT'S SO -- SO IT PUTS A BARRIER

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:14.316
IN THE PERSON ENTERING INTO THE

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:15.350
PROGRAM.

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:18.654
SO OF THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.924
I WOULD -- PERHAPS AS THE

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:23.225
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FOR

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.927
GOING TO MOVE THIS BILL. TO

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:27.062
CONSIDER -- WHETHER THAT THE

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:30.332
CLUSTER WORDS -- PURSUING.

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:31.767
AND THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER --

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:36.672
DROPPING THIS AMENDMENT.

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.841
HE STEP HEADS UP THIS ALREADY IS

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:40.108
ABOVE.

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:45.080
THE FISCAL [inaudible] FOR

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.215
TWENTY EIGHT EIGHT THIS BILL AS

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:47.216
IT CURRENTLY STANDS.

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:48.750
YEAH BUT I'M SAYING THAT THE

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:50.252
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.053
WHEN THEY LOOK AT THESE

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:53.222
AMENDMENTS DISS ACROSS?

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:54.923
THE PUSHES THE COST OF THE

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:57.092
PROGRAM UP.

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:58.260
ABOVE SO THE COST OF THE THE

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.529
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS AND

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:01.096
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY ALL THESE

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.030
THINGS.

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:04.199
ADD TO THE COST OF THE PROGRAM

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:06.001
WHICH MAKES IT MORE.

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:08.203
IT MAKES A BEYOND A TWENTY EIGHT

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.805
POINT EIGHT EIGHT THAT'S WHY HE

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:11.373
IS ALREADY KEY THIS IS SEVEN

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.076
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:15.677
SO PRIOR TO THESE IN THEM INTO

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:16.812
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:18.480
EVERYONE'S CLEAR IT'S ALREADY

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.515
QUEUED IS.

NIELSEN [inaudible]

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:26.889
THEY ARE.

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:29.224
THEN THE INCARCERATED POPULATION

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:29.524
[inaudible]

01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:32.294
THEIR CONSTANCE. ONE OF WHICH

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.596
EARLY ON SADLY.

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:36.498
THEY DIDN'T GET NURTURED

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:36.798
[inaudible]

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.734
THE DIFFICULTY.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.103
SOMETIMES FROM THE WALMART

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:41.403
[inaudible]

THE REASON FOR ME EVEN WANTING

OR ON THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX

02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:43.535
SIDE NOT ON THE CORPORATE SIDE

02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:45.671
AND YET IT'S ONLY CORPORATE.

02:10:45.737 --> 02:10:47.306
TAX EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS THAT

02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:33.919

THE CORPORATE SIDE.

02:11:52.304 --> 02:11:54.439
BUT TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY

THAT'S WHY WE CALL FOR PUBLIC

THE SCALES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE --

02:18:08.713 --> 02:18:10.782
FOR AND THIS PASSIONATE -- WE'RE

02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:13.351
LOOKING WE'RE HOPING TO LOOK AT

02:18:13.418 --> 02:18:15.587
ALL THE FACTORS AND SO INPUT

02:18:15.654 --> 02:18:16.721
FROM THESE VERY STAKEHOLDERS

02:18:16.788 --> 02:18:17.288
THIS.

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:17.956
IS OF COURSE GOING TO BE

02:18:18.023 --> 02:18:20.091
IMPORTANT AND LOOK FORWARD TO

02:18:20.158 --> 02:18:21.326
WORKING WITH THE BUSINESS

02:18:21.393 --> 02:18:23.328
COMMUNITY TO ACCURATELY ASSESS

02:18:23.395 --> 02:18:24.529
THE VALUE OF THEIR TAX

02:18:24.596 --> 02:18:26.297
EXPENDITURES TO OUR STATE THAT'S

02:18:26.364 --> 02:18:28.199
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING -- FOR THERE

02:18:28.266 --> 02:18:31.469
ISN'T ANY -- CRITERIA THAT I'M

02:18:31.536 --> 02:18:32.871
AWARE OF THAT LIMITED TO THE

02:18:32.937 --> 02:18:34.606
INCENTIVE ASPECT THERE ARE LOTS

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:39.010
OF ASPECTS -- FOR THESE TAX --

02:18:39.077 --> 02:18:40.712
CREDITS AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND

02:18:40.779 --> 02:18:42.914
AND WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE MALL --

02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:44.249
I THINK THE ISSUE THE FEDERAL

02:18:44.315 --> 02:18:46.518
TAX CONFORMITY IS A GOOD ONE

02:18:46.584 --> 02:18:47.619
BECAUSE WHAT WAS UNDER TWO

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:49.688
FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY TWENTY

02:18:49.754 --> 02:18:50.889
YEARS AGO MAY NOT BE WHAT

02:18:50.955 --> 02:18:53.525
FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY IS TODAY.

02:18:53.591 --> 02:18:56.428
AND SO WE MAY WANT -- TO AS WE

02:18:56.494 --> 02:18:57.729
LOOK AT THESE THINGS --

02:18:57.796 --> 02:18:59.864
RECOGNIZE WHAT THE TAX LAWS ARE

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:01.866
TODAY AND AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:19:01.933 --> 02:19:03.401
ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEM MAKE

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:05.837
SURE THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING THEM.

02:19:05.904 --> 02:19:07.639
AND THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHY WE

02:19:07.706 --> 02:19:11.476
NEED TO HAVE THIS KIND OF

02:19:11.543 --> 02:19:13.344
PROCESS -- THERE WAS A STATEMENT

02:19:13.411 --> 02:19:15.246
TO ABOUT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:19:15.313 --> 02:19:18.416
FINANCE DOING AND ANALYSIS.

02:19:18.483 --> 02:19:20.485
THEY THEY ACTUALLY DON'T DO AN

02:19:20.552 --> 02:19:22.220
ANALYSIS PER SE THEY THEY

02:19:22.287 --> 02:19:23.788
ACTUALLY TO STATE THE AMOUNT OF

02:19:23.855 --> 02:19:26.491
REVENUE THAT IS LOST BY THESE

02:19:26.558 --> 02:19:27.792
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO WE WILL

02:19:27.859 --> 02:19:29.994
AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE'VE INVITED

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:31.763
OR THAT THIS INCLUDES A VARIETY

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:34.099
OF DIFFERENT -- EXPERTS THAT

02:19:34.165 --> 02:19:35.767
EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO DO

02:19:35.834 --> 02:19:38.303
THIS AND TO BE OBJECTIVE IN THAT

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:41.906
WORK SO -- BASICALLY I I YOU

02:19:41.973 --> 02:19:43.274

02:19:43.341 --> 02:19:46.344
CONCERNS ARE ARE LEGITIMATE I

02:19:46.411 --> 02:19:48.213

TO KEEP WORKING WITH THEM

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:50.682
BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT HERE'S AN

02:19:50.749 --> 02:19:52.717
OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S

02:19:52.784 --> 02:19:55.487
WORKING WHAT ISN'T WHAT WE CAN

02:19:55.553 --> 02:19:57.889
DO TO MAKE IT BETTER -- IF WE

02:19:57.956 --> 02:20:01.426

02:20:01.493 --> 02:20:02.994
HAVEN'T TO BE OBJECTIVE AND

02:20:03.061 --> 02:20:05.130
NONPARTISAN AND DISPASSIONATE

02:20:05.196 --> 02:20:06.965
BECAUSE TAX DOLLARS ARE TAX

02:20:07.031 --> 02:20:09.267
DOLLARS WHETHER THEY COME FROM

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:10.502
REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS ARE

02:20:10.568 --> 02:20:11.436

LEGISLATURE TO ANSWER THOSE

02:20:20.445 --> 02:20:21.146

ALL OF THE INFORMATION.

02:23:06.811 --> 02:23:08.680
AS FACTORED AS ACCURATELY AS

02:23:08.746 --> 02:23:11.349
POSSIBLE TO BRING IT TOGETHER

02:23:11.416 --> 02:23:13.084
AND TO OF FORMULATE

02:23:13.151 --> 02:23:14.852
RECOMMENDATIONS BASED UPON THE

02:23:14.919 --> 02:23:16.521
NUMBERS IF YOU WILL TO THE

02:23:16.587 --> 02:23:18.122
LEGISLATURE WHICH IS THE POLICY

02:23:18.189 --> 02:23:19.257
MAKING BODY.

02:23:19.324 --> 02:23:20.558
AND THEN OF COURSE THEY'LL BE

02:23:20.625 --> 02:23:23.461
THOSE LAYERS OF DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:23:23.528 --> 02:23:25.330
PRIORITIES AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:26.998
THE DATA HAS TO BE THERE.

02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:28.933
AND FOR AND THAT'S WHAT THE GOAL

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.134
IS OF THESE GROUPS IS TO GET THE

02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:32.704
DATA MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE

02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:34.372
LA OR DEPARTMENT FINANCER FRENCH

02:23:34.439 --> 02:23:35.340
I SEXUAL WHOEVER IT IS.

02:23:35.406 --> 02:23:37.241
WILL BE REACHING OUT TO THE

02:23:37.308 --> 02:23:39.577
VARIOUS ENTITIES TO LABOR TO THE

02:23:39.644 --> 02:23:40.578
CHAMBER TO ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:23:40.645 --> 02:23:42.547
GROUPS FOR THAT INFORMATION FROM

02:23:42.613 --> 02:23:46.050
THEM AND BRING IT BACK INTO THE

02:23:46.117 --> 02:23:49.487
REPORT ITSELF.

02:23:49.554 --> 02:23:51.322
THE IDEA OF PROVIDING COMPARED

02:23:51.389 --> 02:23:53.257
AS WITH OTHER STATES KIND OF A

02:23:53.324 --> 02:23:55.560
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES -- IS

02:23:55.626 --> 02:23:57.028
THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE

02:23:57.095 --> 02:23:58.029
ENCOURAGED OR DO WE NEED TO MAKE

02:23:58.096 --> 02:23:59.731
AN AMENDMENT I I THINK I THINK

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:01.132
IT'S AGAIN SOMETHING WE CAN

02:24:01.199 --> 02:24:03.201
CONTINUE TO WORK ON BECAUSE

02:24:03.267 --> 02:24:04.135
AGAIN.

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:06.104
IF WE ARE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES

02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:08.539
IN CALIFORNIA TAKE TAKE THE

02:24:08.606 --> 02:24:11.042
MOVIE TAX CREDIT CLEARLY WE DO

02:24:11.109 --> 02:24:13.745
THAT IN PART BECAUSE IF WE DON'T

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:15.480
PROVIDE THAT BENEFIT THE THEN

02:24:15.546 --> 02:24:16.881
THE INDUSTRY IS MOVING ELSEWHERE

02:24:16.948 --> 02:24:18.883
GEORGE'S BECOME VERY ATTRACTIVE

02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:20.218
I THINK FLORIDA I THINK.

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:21.953
OTHER PLACES SO WE HAVE TO DO

02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:23.554
SOME KIND OF COMPARISON TO

02:24:23.621 --> 02:24:25.857
JUSTIFY THAT TAX CREDIT WHICH BY

02:24:25.923 --> 02:24:28.793
THE WAY WE DO NOW ANNUALLY SO

02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:29.927
ONE OF THE THINGS I'M EXPECTING

02:24:29.994 --> 02:24:31.863
IS THAT WILL LOOK AT WHAT THE

02:24:31.929 --> 02:24:32.764
LITTLE BILL.

02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:34.966
CALLED FOR WHICH IS ESTABLISHING

02:24:35.033 --> 02:24:37.101
METRICS AND THEIR SUNSETS ON

02:24:37.168 --> 02:24:38.970
EVERY TAX CREDIT WE'VE GIVEN

02:24:39.037 --> 02:24:41.172
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HAS

02:24:41.239 --> 02:24:41.939
TO MEET UP TO CERTAIN

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:43.941
MEASUREMENTS IN ORDER FOR IT TO

02:24:44.008 --> 02:24:45.710
JUSTIFY ITS EXISTENCE GOING

02:24:45.777 --> 02:24:46.644
FORWARD.

02:24:46.711 --> 02:24:48.112
THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T HAVE

02:24:48.179 --> 02:24:49.981
THAT FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED

02:24:50.048 --> 02:24:52.116
PRIOR TO TWENTY FOURTEEN AND

02:24:52.183 --> 02:24:52.717
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE

02:24:52.784 --> 02:24:54.919
TRYING TO DO IS FILL THAT GAP

02:24:54.986 --> 02:24:56.320
BUT DO IT OBJECTIVELY.

02:24:56.387 --> 02:24:58.056
DO IT BECAUSE IF IT'S HELPING

02:24:58.122 --> 02:25:00.258
THE STATE IF IT'S BENEFITING THE

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:01.292
TAXPAYER FITS PER IF IT'S

02:25:01.359 --> 02:25:03.728
SERVING SOME PUBLIC POLICY.

02:25:03.795 --> 02:25:06.397
THEN WE WANT TO KEEP IT SO IT'S

02:25:06.464 --> 02:25:08.599
JUST BASICALLY A ME TRYING TO GO

02:25:08.666 --> 02:25:11.702
BACK -- AND GET THE SAME ANSWERS

02:25:11.769 --> 02:25:13.671
THAT WE NOW REQUIRE AS WE DO TAX

02:25:13.738 --> 02:25:15.706
CREDITS GOING FORWARD IT'S NOT

02:25:15.773 --> 02:25:16.974
OUR MONEY IT'S THE TAXPAYERS

02:25:17.041 --> 02:25:18.443
MONEY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S

02:25:18.509 --> 02:25:19.644
BEING SPENT PROPERLY.

02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:21.379
TODAY WE WE'VE GONE OVER A BUNCH

02:25:21.446 --> 02:25:23.147
OF NEW PROS CREDITS MAYBE

02:25:23.214 --> 02:25:28.119
EXPANDED RENTER'S CREDIT --

02:25:28.186 --> 02:25:29.253
ENTERPRISE ZONES TO SECTION

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:29.921
EIGHT CREDITS ALL KINDS OF GREAT

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:31.622
IDEAS -- BUT YOU'RE ONLY

02:25:31.689 --> 02:25:32.857
LIMITING THIS TO CORPORATE

02:25:32.924 --> 02:25:34.325
RELATED.

02:25:34.392 --> 02:25:35.827
AT THIS POINT TIME THAT'S WHERE

02:25:35.893 --> 02:25:36.861
WE'RE STARTING WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:25:36.928 --> 02:25:39.263
ABOUT THE A TOTAL IS ABOUT SIXTY

02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:40.498
SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE

02:25:40.565 --> 02:25:42.967
COURSE OF TEN YEARS THAT HAVE

02:25:43.034 --> 02:25:45.837
GONE IN THESE TAX CREDITS -- I

02:25:45.903 --> 02:25:48.840
BELIEVE -- OR IS IT SIXTY SIX

02:25:48.906 --> 02:25:50.141
BILLION ANNUALLY FOR ALL OF

02:25:50.208 --> 02:25:52.043
THESE TAX CREDITS THE ONES WE'RE

02:25:52.110 --> 02:25:53.411
LOOKING AT HERE.

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:55.546
ARE ABOUT SIX POINT SOMETHING

02:25:55.613 --> 02:25:59.016
BILLION A YEAR -- TO THAT -- ARE

02:25:59.083 --> 02:26:00.751
A DOLLAR SHOULD DON'T COME INTO

02:26:00.818 --> 02:26:01.886
THE STATE.

02:26:01.953 --> 02:26:02.687
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T I MEAN

02:26:02.753 --> 02:26:04.088
THAT'S THE QUESTION IS SHOULD

02:26:04.155 --> 02:26:05.556
THEY OR SHOULDN'T THING AND WE

02:26:05.623 --> 02:26:06.858
DON'T KNOW.

02:26:06.924 --> 02:26:09.327
AND THAT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME AND

02:26:09.393 --> 02:26:10.161
I SUSPECT IT'S FRUSTRATING TO

02:26:10.228 --> 02:26:12.597
DEAL WITH GOD INDIVIDUALS THAT

02:26:12.663 --> 02:26:14.098
FILE THIRD TEN FORTY IS AN EVER

02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:15.266
SCHEDULE SEE THEY'RE NOT

02:26:15.333 --> 02:26:17.735
INCORPORATED.

02:26:17.802 --> 02:26:19.604
BUT THEY QUALIFY.

02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:20.438
FOR TAX CREDITS OF A BUSINESS

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:21.239
NATURE SO I'M JUST.

02:26:21.305 --> 02:26:23.040
KIND OF WONDERING.

02:26:23.107 --> 02:26:24.208
HOW DO WE?

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:26.310
WELL WE STARTED WITH THESE NINE

02:26:26.377 --> 02:26:27.178
BECAUSE THEY WERE.

02:26:27.245 --> 02:26:29.514
SHE'S ME BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT --

02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:31.082
UP TO I THINK IT'S A BILLION

02:26:31.149 --> 02:26:33.417
DOLLARS ANNUALLY OF TAX CREDITS

02:26:33.484 --> 02:26:34.752
AND AGAIN -- WITH THAT THIS BILL

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:37.121
DOESN'T SAY WE WE CAN'T DO MORE

02:26:37.188 --> 02:26:38.623
GOING FORWARD BUT WE HAVE

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:41.159
IDENTIFIED NINE THAT REPRESENT

02:26:41.225 --> 02:26:42.894
THE THE LARGEST -- I BELIEVE

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:44.629
CORPORATE TAX CREDITS THAT WE

02:26:44.695 --> 02:26:46.831
GIVE AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M

02:26:46.898 --> 02:26:48.599
FOCUSING ON HERE WITH THE BILL.

02:26:48.666 --> 02:26:50.334
WE SEE THAT IT'S BENEFICIAL AND

02:26:50.401 --> 02:26:51.969
THAT IT'S WORKING WELL WE MAY

02:26:52.036 --> 02:26:54.438
WANT TO ADD ON ADDITIONAL TAX

02:26:54.505 --> 02:26:56.174
CREDITS BUT WE FELT THAT --

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:57.575
LET'S START WITH THESE --

02:26:57.642 --> 02:26:59.510
BECAUSE THEY DO REP REFLECT

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:00.678
BILLION DOLLARS YEAR MORE THAT

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:01.946
WHICH MONEY THAT WOULD OTHERWISE

02:27:02.013 --> 02:27:03.748
GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND.

02:27:03.814 --> 02:27:05.950
AND LET'S SEE WHETHER LET'S SEE

02:27:06.017 --> 02:27:07.885
HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS AND GO

02:27:07.952 --> 02:27:08.319
FROM THERE.

02:27:08.386 --> 02:27:10.087
OLD THE DATA YOU'LL BE LOOKING

02:27:10.154 --> 02:27:12.690
AT IS BASED ON STATIC

02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:15.226
INFORMATION -- SO MY MOTHER

02:27:15.293 --> 02:27:16.227
ALWAYS SAID YOU HAD TO SPEND A

02:27:16.294 --> 02:27:17.528
DIME TO MAKE A QUARTER.

02:27:17.595 --> 02:27:19.630
AND SO SOME OF THESE INCENTIVES

02:27:19.697 --> 02:27:22.466
OR CREDITS ARE DESIGNED TO

02:27:22.533 --> 02:27:23.734
ENCOURAGE MORE ACTIVITY

02:27:23.801 --> 02:27:25.403
ABSOLUTELY I WOULD SAY MAYBE THE

02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:27.338
REAGAN TAX CUT GENERATED MORE

02:27:27.405 --> 02:27:28.940
REVENUES YOU MIGHT HAVE A TAX

02:27:29.006 --> 02:27:30.341
RATE DECREASE BUT IT.

02:27:30.408 --> 02:27:33.444
REVENUE INCREASE -- SO I'M I'M

02:27:33.511 --> 02:27:35.079
JUST CURIOUS TO READ.

02:27:35.146 --> 02:27:36.647
YOU KNOW IS IS THE LA -- GONNA

02:27:36.714 --> 02:27:38.482
BE DOING MODELING OR WE JUST

02:27:38.549 --> 02:27:39.083
LOOKING AT JUST HARD DATA AND

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:39.984
THEN.

02:27:40.051 --> 02:27:42.653
GO FROM THERE.

02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:44.222
I THINK THAT -- AGE WOULD BE

02:27:44.288 --> 02:27:46.324
OPEN TO THE INTERPRETATION LA --

02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:48.125
I CAN'T IMAGINE AS THROUGH IS

02:27:48.192 --> 02:27:51.529
THE ELIO IS CURRENTLY AND YOU'RE

02:27:51.596 --> 02:27:52.096
TRYING TO BECOME EVEN MORE

02:27:52.163 --> 02:27:54.165
ROBUST THEY ACTUALLY WOULDN'T DO

02:27:54.232 --> 02:27:56.167
THE MODELING -- THAT YOU'RE

02:27:56.234 --> 02:27:57.768
TALKING ABOUT AS WELL CAN'T

02:27:57.835 --> 02:27:59.337
SPEAK TO THAT AT THE MOMENT BUT

02:27:59.403 --> 02:28:00.538
COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD

02:28:00.605 --> 02:28:02.373
NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE AS THOROUGH

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:04.842
A REVIEW. TO THE LEGISLATURE IS

02:28:04.909 --> 02:28:06.577
POSSIBLE I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:09.513
WE HAVE A COUPLE SENATORS HERE

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:10.715
AT THE MOMENT.

02:28:10.781 --> 02:28:12.550
WE ARE GOING TO LOSE -- NEVER

02:28:12.617 --> 02:28:15.286
SENATOR HERE ABOUT.

02:28:15.353 --> 02:28:15.886
TWELVE THIRTY SO I JUST WANTED

02:28:15.953 --> 02:28:16.387
JUST.

02:28:16.454 --> 02:28:17.221
TAKE NOTE OF THAT AND THIS TO ME

02:28:17.288 --> 02:28:19.056
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE THAT HAVE

02:28:19.123 --> 02:28:21.259
A QUICK COMMENT AS WELL SO THIS

02:28:21.325 --> 02:28:22.226
ONE MAKE SURE BUT MISTER VICE

02:28:22.293 --> 02:28:22.927
CHAIR THE FORCE OR SPRING

02:28:22.994 --> 02:28:24.562
RESEARCHER I HAVE BEEN HERE ALL

02:28:24.629 --> 02:28:25.630
DAY.

02:28:25.696 --> 02:28:27.064
SO IT'S A FROM LIFE -- THOUGHT

02:28:27.131 --> 02:28:28.432
CLOSE WITH THIS QUESTION.

02:28:28.499 --> 02:28:30.334
MR MAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO REACT

02:28:30.401 --> 02:28:32.336
TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE

02:28:32.403 --> 02:28:32.903
QUESTIONS I DIRECTED TO THE

02:28:32.970 --> 02:28:33.638
SENATOR.

02:28:33.704 --> 02:28:34.905
YES FIRST OF ALL THE FTV

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:36.307
TYPICALLY PROVIDES JUST THE DATA

02:28:36.374 --> 02:28:38.109
BUT NOT AN ANALYSIS ON THAT DATE

02:28:38.175 --> 02:28:39.410
IS TYPICALLY USE BUT BY THE

02:28:39.477 --> 02:28:41.245
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHEN THEY

02:28:41.312 --> 02:28:42.179
PREPARE THEIR TAX EXPENDITURE

02:28:42.246 --> 02:28:44.415
REPORT -- ONE IMPORTANT POINT TO

02:28:44.482 --> 02:28:46.217
CLARIFY IS THE THE AMENDMENTS

02:28:46.284 --> 02:28:48.719
PROPOSED AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE

02:28:48.786 --> 02:28:50.688
BUT ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS

02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:51.722
OPTIONAL IT.

02:28:51.789 --> 02:28:53.057
PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR PUBLIC

02:28:53.124 --> 02:28:54.558
INPUT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT

02:28:54.625 --> 02:28:56.794
BUSINESSES NEED A STAKE IN THAT

02:28:56.861 --> 02:28:58.396
AND NEED AN EQUAL VOICE ON THE

02:28:58.462 --> 02:29:00.464
BOARD SO HAVING A REPRESENTATIVE

02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:01.666
OR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE

02:29:01.732 --> 02:29:02.900
BUSINESS COMMUNITY. TO TALK

02:29:02.967 --> 02:29:04.635
ABOUT THE SPECIFIC AND HAVING

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:05.336
FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE AND

02:29:05.403 --> 02:29:07.605
EXPERIENCE ABOUT HOW THESE TAX

02:29:07.672 --> 02:29:08.906
INCENTIVES WORK.

02:29:08.973 --> 02:29:10.741
IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT CRITICAL

02:29:10.808 --> 02:29:12.276
TO THE EXCESS THE SUCCESS OF THE

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:14.512
QUALITY OF THE DATA TO BE USED

02:29:14.578 --> 02:29:16.747
FOR THE EVALUATION -- SECONDLY

02:29:16.814 --> 02:29:18.115
I'D LIKE TO RE EMPHASIZE THE

02:29:18.182 --> 02:29:20.284
POINT THAT THE PEW RESEARCH

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:22.520
FOCUSES ON ONLY TAX INCENTIVES

02:29:22.586 --> 02:29:25.089
THAT MEANS EXEMPTIONS DEDUCTIONS

MOMENTARILY.

02:31:35.553 --> 02:31:36.353
LOOK THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:37.021
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION

02:31:37.087 --> 02:31:38.322
THIS LEGISLATURE FOR MANY MANY

02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:40.458
YEARS WELL PROCEED MY TIME. TO

02:31:40.524 --> 02:31:42.460
BE ABLE TO ADVANCE A PROCESS

02:31:42.526 --> 02:31:43.561
THAT IS TRANSPARENT [inaudible]

02:31:43.627 --> 02:31:45.262
DATA DRIVEN.

02:31:45.329 --> 02:31:45.863
I IN IMPLEMENTS OVERSIGHT AND

02:31:45.930 --> 02:31:46.797
REVIEW.

02:31:46.864 --> 02:31:47.698
AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ALL SIDES

02:31:47.765 --> 02:31:49.266
OF THE ISSUE AT THE TABLE.

02:31:49.333 --> 02:31:51.135
I WHICH IS.

02:31:51.202 --> 02:31:52.536
REASON WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS

02:31:52.603 --> 02:31:54.505
ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:57.408
MADE UP OF BOTH -- BUSINESS AND

02:31:57.475 --> 02:31:59.276
I DON'T OVERSIMPLIFY BY THE WAY

02:31:59.343 --> 02:32:02.112
RIGHT BUSINESS LABOR AND

02:32:02.179 --> 02:32:03.581
TAXPAYERS.

02:32:03.647 --> 02:32:05.449
END I I THINK THAT THERE WERE

02:32:05.516 --> 02:32:07.785
SOME.

02:32:07.852 --> 02:32:08.586
IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WERE

02:32:08.652 --> 02:32:09.587
BROUGHT UP.

02:32:09.653 --> 02:32:11.755
AS FAR AS THE EVALUATION

02:32:11.822 --> 02:32:14.425
TECHNIQUES. ONE I THINK WE DO

02:32:14.492 --> 02:32:15.993
NEED TO LOOK AT IT'S NOT THIS

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:19.663
BILL SOMETHING TO CONSIDER LATER --

02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:21.165
THE INCREASE OF PROPERTY TAX.

02:32:21.232 --> 02:32:22.333
I THINK THAT ABSOLUTELY MAKES

02:32:22.399 --> 02:32:24.635
SENSE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:32:24.702 --> 02:32:27.004
WE SHOULD BE REVIEWING -- AS ONE

02:32:27.071 --> 02:32:29.673
OF THOSE TRIGGERS THAT THIS

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:33.544
COMMITTEE SHOULD I STUDY END.

02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:35.212
OUT WHAT IS THAT POTENTIAL.

02:32:35.279 --> 02:32:36.947
POSITIVE HATE TO THE GENERAL

02:32:37.014 --> 02:32:39.483
FUND FROM THE AT TAX CREDIT AS

02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:41.819
WELL I THINK THAT ALSO MAKES

02:32:41.886 --> 02:32:46.557
SENSE I BROUGHT UP -- I THINK%

02:32:46.624 --> 02:32:49.493
THAT WE GO DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:51.262
OUT WHEN WE START WANTING TO BE

02:32:51.328 --> 02:32:53.931
ABLE TO ADD NINE STATE AGENCY

02:32:53.998 --> 02:32:55.733
MEMBERS -- BECAUSE WHERE DOES

02:32:55.799 --> 02:32:56.700
THAT STOP [inaudible]

02:32:56.767 --> 02:32:58.802
BOB.

02:32:58.869 --> 02:33:00.504
THAT SAID I THINK WE WILL BE

02:33:00.571 --> 02:33:02.373
RIGHT AND I DON'T EVERYONE SPEAK

02:33:02.439 --> 02:33:02.973
FROM THE GOOD CENTER FOR SANTA

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:04.375
BARBARA BUT OPEN HAVE A

02:33:04.441 --> 02:33:06.877
CONVERSATION BUT I JUST WANNA.

02:33:06.944 --> 02:33:08.846
FLAG IT AT THAT IT COULD BE A

02:33:08.913 --> 02:33:10.281
SLIPPERY SLOPE AND WHAT CAN WE

02:33:10.347 --> 02:33:12.449
DO TO BE A FOCUS ON THAT

02:33:12.516 --> 02:33:15.019
ADVISORY COMMITTEE -- THAT WOULD

02:33:15.085 --> 02:33:16.754
BE ABLE TO BEEF UP THEIR ROLE IN

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:18.188
THIS PROCESS AS WELL I THINK THE

02:33:18.255 --> 02:33:19.690
OTHER IMPORTANT PART OF ALL THIS.

02:33:19.757 --> 02:33:21.792
IS THAT THESE WOULD BE OPEN

02:33:21.859 --> 02:33:24.361
MEETINGS THAT WHERE INDIVIDUALS

02:33:24.428 --> 02:33:25.462
WOULD BE ABLE TO COME SPEAK IN

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:27.231
OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE TO HAVE.

02:33:27.298 --> 02:33:28.499
THOSE MEETINGS AT ONE ON ONE

02:33:28.566 --> 02:33:31.402
WITH THAT POTENTIAL MEMBERS.

02:33:31.468 --> 02:33:33.070
AGAIN I THINK THAT THERE'S GOING

02:33:33.137 --> 02:33:35.873
TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL -- FOCUS

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:37.608
ON THIS IN THE MONTHS TO COME

02:33:37.675 --> 02:33:39.743
AND I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU

02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:41.979

OUR STATE THANK YOU TO THOSE WHO --

02:33:45.282 --> 02:33:46.684

EXACERBATING THAT THEY BROUGHT

02:33:47.918 --> 02:33:49.320
UP SOME GOOD POINTS AND

02:33:49.386 --> 02:33:52.289
OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL CONTINUE.

02:33:52.356 --> 02:33:54.458
TO BE A GREATER DISCUSSION AS A

02:33:54.525 --> 02:33:55.459

INPUT DURING THE PROCESS.

02:34:15.179 --> 02:34:16.914
THAT INPUT THEN WILL BE

02:34:16.981 --> 02:34:18.616
REFLECTED IN A REPORT IT WILL

02:34:18.682 --> 02:34:20.484
COME TO THE LEGISLATURE WHERE

STATES THAT ARE AHEAD OF US IN

02:35:06.697 --> 02:35:08.332

TO DO AND ARE SERVING THEIR

02:35:19.743 --> 02:35:20.911
PURPOSE AND THEN WE SHOULD

NEED TO EXPAND THEM WE DO THAT

02:35:35.492 --> 02:35:36.727
BUT WE NEED THE DATA AND THAT'S

02:35:36.794 --> 02:35:38.228

THE DECADE CURRENTLY AS IT READS

02:35:49.673 --> 02:35:50.841
