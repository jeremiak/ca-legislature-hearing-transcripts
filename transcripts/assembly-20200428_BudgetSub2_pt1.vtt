LEARNING ABOUT AT A NUMBER OF

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:01.959
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AS

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:03.160
YOU CAN IMAGINE. THE NEXT

00:36:03.227 --> 00:36:05.263
EXPECTATION IF THAT SCHOOLS

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:06.731
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MEALS WITH

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:08.733
STUDENTS- AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:10.968
THEN ARE. PROVIDED IN PART

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:12.603
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FEDERAL

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.238
FLEXIBILITY IN THE PHONE

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.440

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:17.742
SCHOOLS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN

00:36:17.808 --> 00:36:19.544
THE WAY THAT THE DELIVERABLES

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.913
MEALS FROM. AND FINALLY THERE'S

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:23.614
AN EXPECTATION THAT SCHOOLS

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:27.151
CONTINUE TO PAY DOWN PLEASE.

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:29.220

SOME BASIC INFORMATION ON SOME

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:33.090
OF THE KEY FUNDING SOURCES IN.

00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:35.359
THE FEDERAL CARRIES OUT THE

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:36.460
WITH THE REFERRAL PIECE OF

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:37.695
LEGISLATION THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:39.530
THAT IT PROVIDED FUNDING- I'M

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:41.132
THE ONE THAT HAS THE EDUCATION

00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:43.134
FUNDING IS THE CARE THAT. I'M

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.468
THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY POTS

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:45.836
THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:47.271
THE TOTAL TWO POINT THREE

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:49.707
BILLION DOLLARS. THE FIRST PART

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:51.175
OF MONEY WHICH IS- THAT

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:52.209
ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:54.478
FUNDING IS THE LARGEST SOURCE

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:55.613
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PRIMARILY

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.882
WILL GO DIRECTLY. TO SCHOOLS

00:36:57.949 --> 00:36:59.784
AND OUR SCHOOLS HAVE PRETTY

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.787
BROAD- THERE ARE SOME BROUGHT

00:37:02.853 --> 00:37:04.055
ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE USED

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:06.724
ATTORNEY COULD BE USED FOR- UP

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:07.959
210% OF THE SPENDING CAN BE

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:11.228
KEPT AT THE STATE LEVEL PARTS

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:12.597
THEY DECISION. ONE IN THE NEXT

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:13.631
TO POP FUNDING IS THE

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:15.533
GOVERNOR'S. EMERGENCY OUR

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.268
EDUCATION RELIEF THAT'S K.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:18.769
TWELVE OR HIGHER EDUCATION BUT

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:21.072
ARE ELIGIBLE- USES OF FUNDING.

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:23.507
AND TV BGS CHALKER AND-

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:24.709
CHOCOLATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:26.410
ARE KIND OF ON A PROGRAMS. OF

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:28.012
THOSE FUNDS WILL GO TO THE

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:31.082
STATE AND THE STATE WILL

00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:31.582
ULTIMATELY DECIDE HOW TO

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:35.553
ALLOCATE. ARE NONE MOVING ON TO

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.954
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET

00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:39.457
OUTLOOK- THINKING ABOUT WHAT

00:37:39.523 --> 00:37:40.992
LOOKSLIKE FOR SCHOOLS I MEAN.

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:42.360
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM A PREVIOUS

00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:43.294
FIVE THERE ARE SOME FEDERAL

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:45.363
FUNDING AVAILABLE. WE DO THINK

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:47.131
BASED ON OVERSEEING A RECORD ON

00:37:47.198 --> 00:37:49.433
THE ECONOMY THAT IS PROBABLY

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.635
NOT GOING TO BE MUCH LESS THAN

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:53.404
THE POTENTIAL- BUDGET AFFECTS-

00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:56.073
THE GOVERNOR OF THE RECESSION-

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.442
IN AS A RESULT OF THE- VIRUS WE

00:37:58.509 --> 00:38:00.277
DO. IF I HAVE ANY NUMBER THING

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:02.213
OUT- UNEMPLOYMENT AND OTHER

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:03.781
ECONOMIC FACTORS WE DO THINK WE

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:04.949
ARE IN A STEP RECESSION AND

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:05.683
THAT LIKELY MEANS A REDUCTION

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.251
IN STATE FUNDING. AND ARE

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:09.453
LIKELY REDUCTION IN OUR FUNDING

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.656
FOR SCHOOLS. I'M SCHOOLS

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:12.623
INSTALL SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.759
THEMSELVES TO HAVE- SOME

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:16.460
RESERVES AVAILABLE THE SERVICE

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:18.062
THAT DOES I CAN HELP CUSHION-

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.130
SOME OF THE EFFECTIVE

00:38:19.196 --> 00:38:21.265
REDUCTIONS- BUT THAT IS

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:22.667
PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH TO WEATHER

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.568
A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN. AND I

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:26.170
CAN JUST GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:31.542

DISTRICTS HAVE ALMOST THIRTY

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:34.078
BILLION DOLLARS IN UNDER.

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:36.547

THAT FUNDING ISN'T ALWAYS

AVAILABLE- FROM THAT IS AROUND

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:41.886
BECAUSE DISTRICTS MY HAVE CASH

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:43.187
FLOW NEEDS. OR THEY MIGHT HAVE

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:43.988

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.296
QUESTION. AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:53.397
MORE THAN DISTRICTS HAD PRIOR

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:56.467
TO. THE GREAT RECESSION- AND WE

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:57.768
STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

THE FISCAL EFFECTS MIGHT BE OF

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:00.104
THIS RECESSION BUT JUST TO GIVE

OF GOING ON AND THIS RECESS NOW

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:31.829
COULD RESULT IN HAVING TO MAKE

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:33.464
MORE BUDGET RE VERSIONS OF THEM.

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:35.332

DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:59.023
AND NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR THEM TO

00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.757
RESPOND AND REACT AND CHANGE

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:01.192
THEIR PLANS. FOR WHAT THEY WERE

00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:02.726
GOING TO DO MORE- MOST OF THE

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:03.861
TIME AND SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:05.329
THAT IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.964
FOR DISTRICTS TO DOUBLES CUTS.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:09.400
ON AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:10.301
HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:11.468
RECESSION IT HAPPENED IN THE

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:12.837
DOT COM BUST WITH THIS THEY

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:13.370
HAVE TO GO IN IN THE MEDIA

00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:15.673
REDUCTION AND THESE ARE. ALWAYS

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:17.575
DIFFICULT OUR CHALLENGES DURING

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.710
OUR- OUR DRINKS ARE ECONOMIC

00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:21.545
DOWNTURNS. THE ADDITIONAL

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:26.150
UNCERTAINTY. THAT I WILL

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:26.750
HIGHLIGHT HERE THE IS UNIQUE.

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:27.351
IN THIS BUT- AT ISSUE BECAUSE

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:28.719
WE ARE IN THE PANDEMIC. IS JUST

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:29.920
A GREAT RUN. ABOUT WHAT

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:31.188
PROGRAMS EVEN LOOK LIKE WHEN

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:33.257
SCHOOL STARTS. ON AS

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.859
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMóN MENTIONED

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:36.894
AT IT YESTERDAY IS A SUB SIX

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:38.796
HEARING THERE WASN'T. ARE THE

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:41.031
ISSUE OF SCHOOLS BEING ARE.

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:42.600
CLOSE WAS HIGHLIGHTED AS A AS A

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.934
PROBLEM FOR GETTING THE ECONOMY

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.269
UP AND RUNNING AND SO. THERE IS

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:46.337
SOME PRESSURE FOR SCHOOLS TO

00:41:46.403 --> 00:41:49.473
OPEN- BUT- IF THEY DO OPEN THAT

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.074
MIGHT BE DEVELOP VERY

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.809
DIFFERENTLY AND SO. AS THE

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:52.877
STATE OF THINKING ABOUT HOW TO

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:54.378
BALANCE ITS BUDGET AND WHETHER

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:55.613
ANYTHING BUT THE REDUCTIONS. ON

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:56.747
THERE ALSO THESE ISSUES OF

00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:58.983
THINKING ABOUT WILL. WATER WHAT

00:41:59.049 --> 00:41:59.950
DO WE EXPECT SCHOOLS TO LOOK

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.685
LIKE AND- THAT MIGHT HAVE. FOR

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:03.554
EXAMPLE CHANGES IN EXPECTATIONS

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.256
FOR WHAT.AUTHORIZES LOOK LIKE

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:06.824
IF. FOR EXAMPLE YOU NEED TO

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.926
HAVE STUDENTS BE SIXTY APART.

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:10.628
THAT MIGHT CHANGE EXPECTED WHAT

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:12.396
DISTRICTS NEED FOR PERSONNEL.

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:14.365
AND HAVE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.532
ALL THOSE THINGS WILL BE. WITH

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.600
THE PART OF THE CONVERSATION AS

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:18.335

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.201
PRESENTATION BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:52.803
WE WILL GET ON WITH OUR OUR

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.539
QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE

MEMBERS I HAVE A FEW BUT

00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:59.243
DEVELOPING A FIRST TWO OTHER.

THAT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I

00:43:05.649 --> 00:43:06.483
MIGHT ASK EVEN THE OTHER

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.085
MEMBERS MIGHT ASK IF THEY'RE

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:09.253
JUST UNKNOWNS AT THIS TIME BUT

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.788
THEY ARE. JUST QUESTIONS WE

00:43:10.854 --> 00:43:12.856
SHOULD START PONDERING- AT THIS

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.892
POINT THE EXPERIENCE WHICH IS.

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:16.894
CERTAINLY GOING TO. IMPACT OUR

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:18.495
THINKING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:22.866
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. BUT IS IT

00:43:22.933 --> 00:43:24.068
A MINUTE AND I DON'T KNOW WHO

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:25.536
THIS QUESTIONS FORCE TO ANYONE

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:26.704
OF YOU CAN JUMP ON IT DO WE

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.872
HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE COVERT

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.641
RELATED COSTS ON SCHOOL

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:31.241
DISTRICTS IN OTHER WORDS IS A

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:34.945
READ A SURVEY- AT ALL WITH THE

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:36.714
EITHER ALL DISTRICTS ARE NUMBER

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.182
DISTRICTS TO IDENTIFY THE

00:43:38.248 --> 00:43:41.919
INCREASED COSTS THEY HAVE SEEN

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:46.156
BECAUSE OF. THE COVERT RESPONSE.

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:47.658
I DON'T WOULD BE FINANCER

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:54.365
DEPART OF EDUCATION. SO JUST GO

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:57.768
HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE-

00:43:57.835 --> 00:44:00.504
WE'VE RECEIVED AS SOME. CASE BY

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:02.606
CASE- INFORMATION FROM CERTAIN

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:04.074
DISTRICTS WHO ARE TRACKING THIS

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:06.877
INFORMATION- OUR SENSE IS THAT

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:07.878
NOT ALL DISTRICTS AT THIS POINT

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:10.781
HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO GET

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:11.382
THEIR ARMS AROUND THE COST OF

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:17.121
THEIR INCURRING. IT DOES SEEM

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:19.523
TO BE. BUT ANYHOW REPAIRED

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.893
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BANDS TO-

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.461
DO. BUSINESS LEARNING OR

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:26.830
PROVIDING MEALS- IN A IN A

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.465
MODIFIED MANNER I'M SO IN

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:30.801
TERMS. WILL STATEWIDE VALUE WE

00:44:30.868 --> 00:44:31.835
DON'T HAVE THAT BUT WE ARE

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:33.971
HEARING ON SOME ISOLATED

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:38.342
INDIVIDUAL- ESTIMATIONS OF THE

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:40.377
COST THE INDIVIDUAL. THANK YOU

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:43.847
AND I IMAGINE IN SOME CASES.

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:45.716
THERE MAYBE EVEN SOME SAVINGS

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:47.184
DOES MEAN THAT WHEN WE OVERALL

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:48.485
INCREASE EXPENDITURES BUT THERE

00:44:48.552 --> 00:44:50.054
MAY BE SOME SPOTS DISTRICTS ARE

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.521
SAVING THAT WOULD BE

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:51.855
INTERESTING TO NOTE AS WELL.

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:53.057
BUT WITH REGARD TO PROVIDING

00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:54.258
DISTANCE LEARNING I THIS IS A

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:55.959
CAN TO THE LAST QUESTIONI

00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:57.061
DON'T KNOW WE HAVE A SURVEY OF

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:58.495
DISTRICTS OF THE COST. THEY

00:44:58.562 --> 00:45:01.265
BORN. TO INCREASE THEIR

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:02.833
DISTANCE LEARNING I KNOW MY OWN

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.435
ONE OF MY OWN DISTRICTS. HAD A

00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:07.538
BY A NUMBER OF- MOBILE DEVICES.

00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:09.039
A COUPLE THOUSAND AS I

00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:11.708
UNDERSTAND IT SO. DO WE KNOW-

00:45:11.775 --> 00:45:14.078
ON AVERAGE WHAT DISTRICTS. ARE

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:16.380
HAVING TO SPEND TO ALLOW FOR

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:21.552
STUDENTS TO DISTANCE LEARN. OR

00:45:21.618 --> 00:45:22.553
THE WAY THAT THEY JUST MIGHT BE

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:23.120
SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:45:23.187 --> 00:45:24.354
EDUCATION SHOULD THINK ABOUT

00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:25.756
SOMETIMES SURVEY TO IDENTIFY

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:27.291
THAT GAP WHERE IS THE DELTA HOW

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:29.593
MANY DEVICES. DID DISTRICTS ON

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.928
AVERAGE HAVE AND HOW MANY DID

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:33.897
THEY NEED TO FULFILL THEIR

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:35.732
OBLIGATION IF YOU WILL TO

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:37.000
PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING THAT

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:38.435
BE SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT

00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:40.437
HAVING SOME SOME DISTRICTS. ARE

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:41.371
YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY HAD A

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:42.873
NUMBER OF MOBILE DEVICES THERE

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.574
ARE ALREADY ASSIGNED TO

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.442
STUDENTS. A SOME DISTRICTS

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.244
DIDN'T HAVE AN ADEQUATE NUMBER

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.680
I KNOW SOMEONE OUT PURCHASED AT

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:50.614
SUMMER PROBABLY HAVE. AND I'VE

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:51.682
ARE WAITING FOR THEM TO SHOW

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.450
UP. SOME MAY HAVE OTHER PLANS I

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:54.118
DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S JUST

00:45:54.184 --> 00:45:55.252
SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:57.221
IDENTIFY BECAUSE I THINK. THE

00:45:57.287 --> 00:45:58.388
DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL IS

00:45:58.455 --> 00:45:59.790
SOMETHING WE MIGHT HAVE TO

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:02.793
BOUNCE IN AND OUT OF NEXT YEAR.

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:03.393
THROUGHOUT THE THAT THE SCHOOL

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.028
YEAR EXPERIENCE. AND QUITE

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:07.931
FRANKLY AS A TEACHER. I MEAN I

00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:10.100
THINK THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:12.069
CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:12.769
DAILY EXPERIENCE OF STUDENTS

00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:14.771
WHERE AN- YEAH THEY GO TO

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.540
SCHOOL. IN A PERFECT WORLD TO

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:17.407
GO TO SCHOOL DURING THE DAY BUT

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:18.909
THEY CAN ALSO SOME MORE ACCESS.

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:22.012
ACCESS TO MORE ENHANCED. ONLINE

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.915
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES- WHEN

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:26.850
THEY GET HOME. TO BACK UP.

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:29.386
THEIR IN SCHOOL EDUCATION-

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:30.854
DURING THE DAY BECAUSE I AM A

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:31.922
FIRM BELIEVER THAT STUDENTS DO

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:34.491
NEED TO GO. TO A SCHOOL GO TO

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:36.560
SCHOOL. BUT I THINK CALIFORNIA

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.794
ON A LOOK AT A SYSTEM THAT'S

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:38.929
MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN WE

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:40.898
HAVE NOW. MUCH MORE FORMALIZED

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.099
WITH ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:46.370
POLICIES ETCETERA- TO PROVIDE-

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:48.605
STUDENTS TO ACCESS- THROUGH

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:51.175
DEVICE AT HOME- LEARNING. AND I

00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:52.209
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:53.844
LIKE. I KNOW WE HAVE SOME

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:55.145
SCHOOLS THAT HVE BEEN DOING

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:55.712
AND I NEED TO TAKE A LOOKAT

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:57.281
THAT. I THINK IT. CERTAINLY

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:59.149
VERY SAN RECORD FOR SURE WE I

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:00.717
THINK THE DATA REFLECTS THAT.

00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:02.085
BUT THAT'S SMETHING AS A STATE

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:03.820
AND AS A COMMITTEE. WE'RE GOING

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:05.255
TO HAVE TO PONDER AS WE GO INTO

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:08.158
NEXT YEAR- HOW DO WE DO THIS. I

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:09.226
DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS I'VE

00:47:09.293 --> 00:47:10.260
BEEN MAINLY IN IN CLASSROOM

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:11.862
TEACHER. TAKEN SOME DISTANCE

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:13.864
CLASSES MYSELF. BUT I DON'T

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:17.935
KNOW THE PLATFORMS. THAT

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.436
ALWAYS THERE. THEIR RADIO

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:21.305
PRIVATE PROVIDERS AT. THAT

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:22.673
PROVIDE THEM NOW THERE'S SCHOOL

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:24.274
OLOGY THEIR SCHOOL UP THERE

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:25.609
SOME OTHERS. TOO I THINK POWER

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.811
SCHOOLS OVER IN FOLSOM IN FACT.

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:28.812
THAT'S ONE OF I RECALL

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.547
CORRECTLY. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:31.982
DO IS A STATE IS ESTABLISH WHAT

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.517
A GOOD PLATFORM LOOKS LIKE WHAT

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:34.618
TOOLS IT SHOULD HAVE SO TEACHER

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.520
CAN BUILD A LESSON. AND THEN

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:38.388
PUSH THAT OUT- MAYBE THROUGH

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:40.090
THE DAY BUT ALSO. AFTER THE

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:41.291
SCHOOL DAY ON A ON AN ONGOING

00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:43.126
BASIS NOT YOURS DURING TIMES OF

00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:44.761
NEED. BUT IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE

00:47:44.828 --> 00:47:46.063
MORSE FOR MORE SEAMLESS

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:49.833
TRANSITION. DURING DURING OUR

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.869
TIMES OF A- DURING ARM ARE WHEN

00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:54.538
WE HAVE EMERGENCIES BE THEY

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:56.139
FIRES MUDSLIDES OR SOMETHING

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:58.275
VERY UNIQUE. LIKE WE ARE

00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:00.244
EXPERIENCING A RIGHT NOW SO

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:01.345
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE ALL

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:02.713
OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT AS A BODY

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:04.014
AND I HOPE THE DEPARTMENTS WILL

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:06.350
CONTEMPLATE AS WELL- WE NEED TO

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:08.652
GET MOVING SO THAT I TURN IT

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:09.253
BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK

00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:12.089
YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER EARLY

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:16.426
AMOUNT THANK YOU AT I EIGHT

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:17.628
THINK THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:20.030
ISSUES AND CERTAINLY DISTANCE

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:21.698
EARNING IS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF

00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:24.067
THEM- THAT YEAH AND I THINK

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:26.803
THAT THE COST OF THE TECHNOLOGY

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:30.140
ITSELF BUT ALSO- THE TECHNOLOGY

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:31.508
THERE'S A COST TO THE

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.076
TECHNOLOGY WORKING THE WAY IT

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:35.012
SHOULD- THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:36.246
CONSIDERED I KNOW OUR

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:36.980
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:39.449
INSTRUCTION- HAS FORMED A TASK

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:42.419
FORCE. TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:45.255
REAL DIGITAL DIVIDE- IN IN OUR

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:47.457
STATE- IN COMMUNITIES ALL

00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:50.294
ACROSS SO IDO HOPE AND THAT

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.995
THE LEGISLATURE IS UPDATED ON

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:55.165
THAT I HAVE- A COUPLE OTHER

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:56.867
QUESTIONS IN AND I WANT TO ASK.

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:58.835
IN TERMS OF ITS SCHOOL MEALS

00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:02.606
AND FUNDING AND AT WHAT AT WHAT

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:05.042
FUNDING RESOURCES ARE DISTRICTS

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:08.545
AT THIS POINT USING- TO PROVIDE

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:10.947
THESE MEALS THERE'S BEEN A LOT

00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:15.752
OF A- THAT. DISCUSSION ABOUT-

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:18.121
WHETHER OR NOT DISTRICTS HAVE

00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:19.556
BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:21.491
MEALS- WE ARE GOING INTO A

00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:23.827
SUMMER AND- THE SUMMER WAS

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:26.263
ALWAYS A TIME. WHERE SO YOU SAW

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:27.531
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE

00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:29.066
STATE WHETHER THEY WERE IN

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:31.068
SCHOOL OR NOT- PROVIDE SOME OF

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:33.103
THESE MEALS- SO I I'M I'M

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:35.172
LOOKING TO SEE WHAT AGAIN THE

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:36.773
FUNDING RESOURCES ARE WHAT'S

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.241
BEING DONE. IS THIS A

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:39.476
SUSTAINABLE THROUGH THE SUMMER

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:42.279
I THINK WE ARE- AT A STATE THAT

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:44.481
BENEFITS SO GREATLY FROM- THE

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:46.750
AD THAT'S HERE- BUT AND I'M

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:48.585
PROUD THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:50.253
NOT HEARING SOME OF THE STORIES

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.655
WE ARE IN OTHER STATES WHERE WE

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:53.824
SEE THAT OUR ADS ARE- YOU KNOW

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:55.025
COMMUNITY IS WORKING WITH NON

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.294
PROFITS AND- WE- WE DON'T SEE

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:59.262
THE WASTE. HAPPENING BUT I ALSO

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:00.764
WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THIS%

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:04.101
MEANS FOR STUDENTS WHO RELIED-

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:06.636
A PRIMARILY ON GETTING FOOD-

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:08.572
FROM THEIR SCHOOL SO IF WE

00:50:08.638 --> 00:50:11.274
COULD HAVE HAD SOMEONE COMMENT

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:13.343
ON THAT THAT WOULD BE GRET. I

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:14.444
THINK WE LOST DEPARTMENT OF

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:15.946
FINANCE FOR A FEW SECONDS OF

00:50:16.012 --> 00:50:18.014
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:18.615
ALEJO WANT TO TAKE A CRACK AT

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:27.457
THAT. GREAT THANK YOU. THAT

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:28.925
GIRL ACROSS THE LA I THINK I

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:30.627
CAN TALK MORE BROADLY ABOUT

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:31.261
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THIS

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:33.163
IS A SIMILAR ISSUE WHERE THE

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:36.233
EXACT- COSTS ARE SOMETHING

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:37.868
SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:40.036
AT THIS POINT OR HOPING THAT

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:40.670
WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME WE

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:42.539
GET SOME. OF THE COMMISSION ON

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:43.306
MEALSREPORTED TO THE

00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:44.908
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:45.475
GIVES US A BETTER SENSE OF

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:46.910
WHAT'S GOING ON- BUT WHAT I

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:48.245
WOULD SAY THAT THE FEDERAL

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:49.279
GOVERNMENT OF PROVIDED A LOT OF

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:51.181
FLEXIBILITY- SO THAT SCHOOLS

00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:52.682
CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MEALS

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:54.551
AND- SETTINGS THAT ARE

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:56.219
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS- WAS

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:57.954
REQUIRED PREVIOUSLY SO NOW FOR

00:50:58.021 --> 00:50:59.556
EXAMPLE PARENTS KATIC PICKUP

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:01.258
MEALS- THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE

00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:03.360
PROVIDED IN GROUP SETTINGS-

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:05.462
IT'S ABOUT- AND YOU CAN ALSO

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:06.730
CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THESE

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:08.665
NIELSEN IN. FIVE STEPS PERHAPS

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:10.000
PREVIOUSLY WHAT AUTHORIZED

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:11.034
THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:12.803
FOR SCHOOLS WELL- TO STILL

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:13.904
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE KNOWS

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.505
AND GET THEM REIMBURSED I'M

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:17.207
MORE WE HAVE HEARD SOME

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:19.443
CONCERNS ARE JUST OF THE NUMBER

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:22.946
OF MEALS THAT- SCHOOLS ARE-

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.080
ISSUING ARE MUCH LOWER THAN

00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:26.316
WHEN SCHOOL IS IN SESSION AND-

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:27.884
AS A RESULT THAT IS GOING TO

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:28.885
REDUCE THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:30.220
FUNDING THAT SCHOOLS ARE

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:32.522
GETTING FROM- THE FEDERAL

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:33.490
GOVERNMENT FROM THE STATE IN

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:35.959
TERMS OF A MEAL REIMBURSEMENT.

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.127
THAT THE WAY THE FUNDING WORKS

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:38.962
WE TYPICALLY PROVIDED ON A PER

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:41.631
A PREMIER ACCOUNT- SO- FOR

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.600
DISTRICTS WOULD BE OUT OF DATE

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:44.701
BY AND LARGE HAVE THEIR SAME

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:46.403
STAFF THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:47.237
WITH THERE'S THEY'RE PAYING THE

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:49.940
STATE'S STAFF- TO DO THE WORK

00:51:50.006 --> 00:51:51.508
AND THEN THAT THE AMOUNT THAT

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:52.642
THEY'RE GETTING NOW FROM THE

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:54.211
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:51:54.277 --> 00:51:54.778
LOWER THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:56.446
ANTICIPATED. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:57.814
HEARD OF THE CONSERVE SIDES

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.683
IT'S NOT THAT THAT THERE IS AN

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:01.251
FUNDING BUT THAT THE AMOUNT

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:02.419
THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:03.987
HIS LICENSE SO THAT'LL BE PART

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:05.789
OF THE COST PRESSURE- WE ARE

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:07.457
ARE HOPING THAT WITH A LITTLE

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:08.291
MORE TIME TO GET MORE

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:09.526
INFORMATION ON WHAT THAT LOOK

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:10.627
LIKE WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:12.796
HAS BEEN- BUT WE KNOW THAT ARE

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:20.537
ALSO VERY NICE BY SCHOOL SITE.

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:21.938
AND MY DISTRICT. THANK YOU. I'M

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:23.106
THE OTHER A PEACE I WAS. TO A

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:25.175
LITTLE BIT IN FOR. OF WHAT. YOU

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:27.377
KNOW CUT THE COST AND THAT

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:28.211
WE'RE SEEING AND WHETHER IT'S

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:29.145
NOW OR WHETHER IT'S IN THE

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:31.615
FUTURE RELATED TO- SOME OF OUR

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:33.183
UNDER REPRESENTED A STUDENT

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:35.585
COMMUNITIES ENGLISH LEARNERS-

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:39.389
AIDS A POPULATION THAT WE ARE

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:41.858
AND- I MEAN WE'VE KNOWN- PRIOR

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:44.561
TO THIS THAT- EDUCATING ENGLISH

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:47.030
LEARNER LEARNERS- IT DIDN'T

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:48.665
REQUIRE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:50.634
BUT NOW THAT YOU COMBINED THE

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.770
POTENTIAL DIGITAL DIVIDE. WITH

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:55.672
THIS EIGHT SEEMS PARTICULARLY

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.507
MORE DIFFICULT- SO CAN WE

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:59.376
COMMENT ON WHAT WE KNOW IS OR

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:01.011
IS NOT HAPPENING- WITH OUR

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:02.479
ENGLISH LEARNER COMMUNITY HERE

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:08.818
IN THE STATE. I WOULD SAY A I

00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.086
THINK YOU'RE THERE ARE A COUPLE

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:12.322
OF ISSUES FOR A WIRE OR

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:13.723
DIFFICULT ONE AS I SUGGESTED

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.825
FOR. STUDENTS MIGHT NEED

00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:17.861
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT THE DISTANCE

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:19.863
LEARNING MODEL IS A LITTLE BIT

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:20.697
DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY RIGHT

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:23.533
NOW. WHERE WE DIDN'T REALLY

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.467
HAVE A LOT OF TIME SCHOOL

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:25.402
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SORT OF

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:27.270
IMPLEMENTED IN A SORT OF. AWFUL

00:53:27.337 --> 00:53:28.471
GRADUAL MANNER THIS IS SORT OF

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:30.240
JUST HAPPENED ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:31.308
THERE'S BEEN ARE A REST TO

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:34.077
ADAPT SO IN BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:34.744
THAT SOME STUDENTS ANY

00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:36.112
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR EXAMPLE

00:53:36.179 --> 00:53:37.080
BY STOPPING WOULD REALLY

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.215
BENEFIT WITH HAVING- SOMEBODY

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:40.817
THERE THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:41.952
IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING THE

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:43.787
DISTANCE LEARNING- IN ADDITION

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:44.588
TO THAT YOU DO HAVE THE

00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:47.424
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH. OUR

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.292
JUST STUDENTS NOT HAVING ACCESS

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:50.961
EITHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:52.429
A DEVICE WE DON'T HAVE-

00:53:52.495 --> 00:53:53.430
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY OR MAYBE

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:54.931
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A OF

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:56.333
ENVIRONMENT IT'S VERY SUITABLE

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:57.767
FOR LEARNING AT HOME. I'M BILLS

00:53:57.834 --> 00:53:58.935
ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:00.170
IT HAPPENED I THINK THAT THIS

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:02.105
IS SOMETHING THAT. I WILL BE

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:03.907
OUT THERE ARE PARTICULARLY BIG

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:05.809
IMPORTANCE IF WE DO AS AS A

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:07.010
MEMBER OF DAHLE MENTION GO IN

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.778
AND OUT OF THE BURNING IF WE

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:10.380
DON'T GET. THE TERRIBLE WOULD

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:11.648
BE MORE THOUGHT OF IN TERMS OF

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:12.849
HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT OUR

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:13.917
PLANS ARE IN PLACE FOR THE

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:15.986
STUDENTS- BUT IT IS A GET

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:16.953
SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT A WE

IN CALIFORNIA WAS MANY TIMES

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:21.824
MORE THAN THIS AND THE SEVERITY

00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:22.892
OF THIS MAY BE EQUAL OR GREATER

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:26.362
TO. WHAT WE SAW- A DECADE AGO

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:28.431

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:29.799
USED TO KEEP THE DISTRICTS HALL

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:31.067

BE THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.042
DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUE WITH

00:59:39.108 --> 00:59:41.811
THAT. LACK OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:43.046
OUT THERE IS WE HAVE TO BE. BE

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:45.682
MINDFUL OF THAT- SO I GUESS I

00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:47.650
JUST WANT TO ASK ONE FOLLOW UP

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:48.785

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:01.130
THEY ONE WAY MORE THAN WHAT

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.333
WE'RE OFFERING RIGHT NOW. SO OF

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:05.201
COURSE THAT THAT THE PIECES

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.636
THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO FILL THE

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:09.372
GAP. OUR ONE TEN MONEY WE HAVE

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.808
IN THE RESERVE- ANY FEDERAL

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.109
MONEY WE ALREADY GOT OR WE

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:14.377
COULD GET INTO THE NEXT ROUND

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.812
FROM FROM FROM THE UNITED

WE CAN DO AS FAR AS- DEFERRALS

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:24.887
OR- YOU KNOW PRIOR TOOLS THAT

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.789
WE USE BECAUSE- THE NUMBER ONE

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:27.991
THING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IS

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:29.459
HOW DO WE- GET OUT OF THIS

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:31.461
ALIVE. AND NOT CUT OUR SCHOOLS.

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.029
NOT CUT OUR KIDS I THINK THAT

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.464
SHOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE GOAL.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.665
THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IN

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.133
ADDITION TO OF COURSE BEING

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.968
HEALTHY CALIFORNIA DEALING WITH

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.470
THE PANDEMIC BUT HOW DO WE-

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.271
HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DAMAGE

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:44.841
TO OUR KIDS AND OUR SCHOOLS. SO

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:46.609
WHAT WHAT ARE WE THINKING FROM

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:50.513
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IS

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.114

CARDS. BUT ARE WE REALISTIC

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.690

STATUS QUO- AT NO- NO NET LOSS

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:06.229

HOWEVER A COUPLE OF THINGS.

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.532
NOTE AT JENNY AT THE JANUARY

01:01:42.598 --> 01:01:44.400
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE WERE-

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:48.304
PROJECTING A PATH ONE IN OUR-

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.405
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:50.873
GUARANTEE LEVEL WHICH IS VERY

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.709
SENSITIVE TO REVENUES- SO

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.645
IMPACT REVENUES ARE VERY LIKELY

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:58.114
TO- IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF

01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.182
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.050
PENDING AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL-

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:02.552
BUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO KEEP

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:05.254
IN MIND- I CAN'T SPEAK. TO WHAT

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:06.255
HAPPENED IN THE PRIOR

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:10.259
RECESSION- AS AS YOU NOTED- YOU

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:11.727
KNOW THAT THIS ECONOMIC IMPACT

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.697
COULD LOOK SIMILAR TO THAT AND-

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:15.798
THERE THERE WERE MANY

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:18.801
DIFFERENT- OPTIONS THAT WE

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:20.903
ADOPTED IN ORDER TO. MITIGATE

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:23.573
THE IMPACT TO SCHOOL- AND THAT

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.174
INCLUDES DEFERRED BANQUET

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.210
DEFERRAL ON USE OF ONE TIME

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:29.979
FUN- BUT IN THE LAST. RECESSION

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:33.282
WE ALSO- DID AT AT LOOK AT

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:35.251
PRODUCTION AND BASS-

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:39.388
APPORTIONMENT. SO YOU KNOW IF

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:41.324
IT IT'S HARD PROJECT EXACTLY

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.425
GOING TO LOOK LIKE IT IS BUT

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:43.926
BECAUSE- THEY SAID WE'RE STILL

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:45.027
WORKING ON THE NAY REVISION

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:47.363
BUT- THERE THERE ARE SOME

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.599
INDICATORS THERE THAT. THERE

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:50.366
MAY BE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.602
THAT NEED TO BE MADE MOVING

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:59.675
FORWARD. AND DID LA WANT TO.

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:02.278
WEIGH IN ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL.

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.514
I'M SURE- I WOULD JUST SAY A

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.782
BIG THE LEGISLATURE DID TAKE A

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:09.252
VARIETY OF ACTIONS LAST TIME TO

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:11.254
TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE- SO

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:11.687
THAT IT WASN'T JUST

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.422
SPECIFICALLY CUTS THE VOTE I

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:14.790
BELIEVE MY UNDERSTANDING IS I

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:16.592
THINK THE CUTS WERE ABOUT. 9%

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.594
CUTS TO GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.229
AOUT 20% CUTS TO CATEGORICAL

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:22.665
PROGRAMS WHEN WE DID RELY

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:23.933
SIGNIFICANTLY OF THE STATE ON

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.335
PATROLS IN THE- IN THE PREVIOUS

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:28.104
ARE RECESSION AND THAT'S

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:30.439
SOMETHING THAT- IS WHAT IS ONE

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:32.041
WAY TO HELP AVOID A SCHOOL

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:34.110
DISTRICT HAVING TO MAKE CUTS-

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:35.278
BUT THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:36.379
WITH WITH DEFERRALS IS IT.

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.314
THERE'S A PARTICULAR THINGS

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:39.148
THEN YOU HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:41.584
FIRST IS THAT- IT DOES CREATE

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:42.885
CASH FLOW BURDENS FOR DISTRICTS

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.587
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:45.855
CAN'T ADDRESS WAS CAST FOR

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.957
NEITHER. IT COMPLAINTS BECOME A

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:49.392
CUT I THINK THAT'S

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.894
PARTICULARLY- CHALLENGING FOR A

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.563
SCHOOL A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:55.631
AND FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND I

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:57.600
THINK THE OTHER THING IS THAT

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:58.668
WHEN YOU DO IT THE FOR ALL YOUR

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:02.505
SORT OF A. OF COUNTING ON.

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:03.706
THINGS GETTING BETTER AND

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:04.540
YOU'RE KIND OF. THE NEED FOR

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.042
THE- BUT IF WE DO HAVE US THE

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:08.110
STATE AND- RECESSION ANALYTICS

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:09.078
MULTIPLE YEARS THAT CAN

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:11.347
SOMETIMES THE NEED TO. CUT THEM

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.648
A FUTURE IF WE DON'T. IF WE

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:14.450
DON'T. HAVE AN INCREASE IN

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:16.219
REVENUES. WHEN THE STATE DID

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.821
THE PATROLS LAST TIME WE- YOU

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:20.623
KNOW THAT WE IMPLEMENTED-

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.992
ESSENTIAL NUMBER OF DEFERRALS-

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:26.495
AND THEN- THEY- COMING. OUT OF

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:27.430
THE STORE TO RECOVER AND THEN

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:29.031
PROP THIRTY WAS PASSED AND THAT

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:30.132
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WAS ABLE

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:32.568
TO PEOPLE'S DOWN AND- AVOID

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:33.970
SOME OF THOSE REDUCTIONS. BUT

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:35.037
THE OTHER THING THAT THE STATE

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:38.207
DID A LOT OF- IT IT WAS- TRYING

01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:39.976
TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY ON.

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.378
CATEGORICAL PROGRAM RESERVES- I

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:43.546
BELIEVE THAT. WE HAVE AT SOME

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:44.480
POINT IT WAS MORE THAN A

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:45.915
BILLION DOLLARS IN CATEGORICAL

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.783
RESERVES THAT HAVE BEEN- IN

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.052
DISTRICTS ARE RESERVES AND WE

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.520
SAID FOR THE- PRINTER. THAT

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.155
RECESSION PERIOD WE SAID. YOU

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:53.990
CAN USE IT FOR ANY PURPOSE AND

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.925
SO DISTRICTS RELY ON THAT TO.

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:57.393
MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE CUTS.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.394
I'M WE DO THINK THAT THAT'S

01:04:58.461 --> 01:04:59.662
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING TO

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.164
BE- AS OUR HELPFUL THIS TIME

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:04.166
AROUND BECAUSE THE LCI FIVE.

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.835
ARE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:06.602
CLEANING UP THE FIVE WE LIVE IN

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:07.737
A LOT OF THESE KIND OF LOCAL

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:08.938
PROGRAM SO. WE HAVE BEEN

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.006
LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT THAT THAT

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.073
ARE AVAILABLE BUT WE DON'T

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.109
EXPECT THAT'S GOING TO BE AS-

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:19.815
AS- ACOSTA MUSIC. THAT WAS IN

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:22.518
THE PAST. SO IN SAM HE DO WE

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.919
THINK THAT WE BE ABLE TO TELL I

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:25.888
KNOW TODAY'S. LATE APRIL WE

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:27.957
HAVEN'T. HAD A CHANCE TO

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:30.326
RECEIVE THE MAY REVISE AND

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:31.794
EVALUATING GRAND THE ME REVISED

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.230
IS. KIND OF I GUESS BECAUSE WE

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:35.965
DON'T HAVE ALL THE REVENUES IN

01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:36.432
BUT WE HAVE A GENERAL

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:38.501
ASSUMPTION BUT- BUT DO WE THINK

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:41.370
THAT WE COULD TELL. SCHOOL THAT

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:41.904
THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:43.973
ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT OBVIOUS

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.374
IS GIVE ME A DIFFICULT BUDGET

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.443
BUT THIS WOULD BE A BUDGET UP A

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.312
STATUS QUO OR WOULD WE EXPECTED

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:51.614
WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE- AT A

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.015
REDUCTION IN THE NEGATIVE WHEN

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:57.053
WE ADOPT OUR- OUR- TWENTY-

01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:02.758
TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. YEAH

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:03.559
I WITH IT AGAIN I THINK WE

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.294
STILL DON'T- OF COURSE I DON'T

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.296
KNOW THAT. WE WITH A COUPLE

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:09.465
THING WE THINK THAT. WE CAN

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:10.833
AVOID THOSE THOSE CUTS ARE THE

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.734
GUY THAT IS AN IMPORTANT

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:12.802
CHALLENGE IN AN IMPORTANT I

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:14.403
THINK CONSIDERATION IN PASSING

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:17.406
THAT JIM BUDGET- I THINK THERE.

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.008
THE AYE THE IDEA IS THAT WE

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:20.076
NEED TO PASSAGE YOU BUDGET OF

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.811
CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED. AND

01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:22.978
THEN IF THIRTY TWO CHANGES

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:24.480
MAYBE THAT WOULD COME IN LATER.

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:25.514
THE LONGER WE WAIT TO MAKE

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:26.349
THOSE CHANGES THE MORE

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:27.483
DIFFICULT IT WILL BE FOR

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.251
DISTRICTS AND SO THE FACT THAT.

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:30.853
IT'S THERE I THINK EVERY YEAR

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.054
ESTIMATING REVENUES IS

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:34.223
DIFFICULT- IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.791
SITUATION IT'S PARTICULARLY

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:37.693
DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING-

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.095
BECAUSE OF THE DELAY IN FOR

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:41.097
EXAMPLE IN THE IN THE APRIL TAX

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.898
PAYMENTS. ARE ABLE TAX FILING

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.700
DEADLINE AND JUST SO

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:45.768
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY WITH

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.236
GROUND ECONOMY. IT'S GOING TO

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.704
BE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TO

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:50.339
SEND OF THESE CLEAR SIGNALS

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:52.141
AND- BUT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:54.110
CONSIDERATION. WITH BUDGET. TO

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.611
THE EXTENT THAT YOU DO SAY FOR

01:06:55.678 --> 01:07:00.015
EXAMPLE- TRY TO AVOID SOME OF

01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:01.650
THE INITIAL CUTS FOR A- NINETY

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:03.419
CUTS IN THE IN THE IN THE

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:08.958
NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR- AND THE

01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:09.558
SITUATION DOES GET WORSE THAT

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:10.192
DOES. DOES REQUIRE BIGGER CA ON

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:11.660
THE LINE. BUT IT. MIGHT BE.

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:13.329
THAT YOU. WANT TO PRESERVE.

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:14.196
IT'LL IT'LL BE CHALLENGING IN

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:14.997
TERMS OF FIGURE THAT OUT SO I

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:16.532
THINK. I'M FORTUNATE WE DON'T

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.200
THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:19.835
INFORMATION TO REALLY SAY.

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:21.470
FIRST CORD YES THIS IS THE SORT

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.472
OF MAGNITUDE OF THE OF THE

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:26.075
FISCAL IMPACT THAT WE WOULD SEE.

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:27.576
THANK YOU THE NEXT WILL HAVE

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.311
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC SAID SHE

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:31.147
AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.549
MR MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:39.054
MUCH- I APPRECIATED TO THE LAST

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.589
LINE OF QUESTIONING FROM- THE

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:43.926
CHAIRMAN AND THE RESPONSES FROM.

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:46.962
THE LA- AND THAT- IT REMINDS ME

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:50.599
OF MY EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.802
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER- WITH THE

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:54.103
TAURUS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:56.705
A DISTRICT WITH ABOUT TWENTY

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.507
FOUR THOUSAND IN ENROLLMENT.

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:00.476
SMALLER THAN A URBAN DISTRICTS

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:04.079
BUT- ABOUT MEDIUM SIZE IN TERMS

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:04.780
OF OUR SUBURBAN SCHOOL

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:08.284
DISTRICTS AND- I KNOW THAT- A

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.286
LOT OF WHATTHE LA- DISCUSSED

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:13.722
IN TERMS OF. THE FLEXIBILITY-

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:16.091
AND THE DEFERRALS REALLY MADE A

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:18.093
WORLD OF DIFFERENCE IN ALLOWING

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.363
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO- IN A

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:24.333
BALANCED THE BUDGET AND KEEP-

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.569
OUR SCHOOLS RUNNING SO I- I

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:27.536
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE AN

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:29.972
ONGOING THEME THAT THAT WE

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:32.007
REALLY NEED TO EMPHASIZE- THE

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:34.877
NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY FOR- FOR

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.479
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO.

DISTRICT. OKAY I GUESS THE REAL

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:43.972
QUESTION IS LET'S USE MY

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:45.940
DISTRICT HERE AS AN EXAMPLE AT

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:48.309
SAKS CITY- THEY'RE CLASSIFIED

DOING THE BEST THEY DON'T HAVE.

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:00.622
PROPER MASK NORTH FACE SHIELDS

01:26:00.688 --> 01:26:02.390

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:03.892
BUT THE DISTRICT DON'T HAVE THE

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:04.959
MADE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:05.627
I GUESS THERE IS THE

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:08.263
OPPORTUNITY TO BITE BUT THAT'S

RECESSION IS TO ALLOW SCHOOL

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:55.409

INITIAL EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM

01:48:35.842 --> 01:48:38.144
THE GOVERNOR. SO NOW IT'S JUST

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:39.746
TEACHERS ARE ENGAGING DISTANCE

01:48:39.813 --> 01:48:41.815

DIFFERENTLY. AT AT ONE LESSON

01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:46.786
YOU COULD BE AN ISSUE WITH A

01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:48.889
TEACHER CONNECTING WITH

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:50.757

OUT OF SCHOOL I IN A SEAMLESS

02:04:54.486 --> 02:04:57.556
WAY WE NEED THAT SAME. AS THE-

02:04:57.623 --> 02:04:59.024
STATE CAN SUPPORT THIS EFFORT

02:04:59.091 --> 02:05:01.060
WITH AWFUL CURRICULUM RESOURCES

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:04.096
AND TRAINING- AND WE ALSO NEED

02:05:04.163 --> 02:05:04.830
TO MOVE TOWARDS A COMPETENCY

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:06.498
BASED APPROACH THAT IS NOT

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:09.368
FOCUSED ONLY ON STEEP TIME. AS

02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:13.272

THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS

02:05:22.414 --> 02:05:23.849
SOME EXPERTS HAVE ADVISED THAT

02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:24.950
STUDENTS SHOULD RETURNS THE

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:26.252

02:05:47.406 --> 02:05:49.575
RESEARCH THAT CONTINUITY AND

STUDENT TEACHER RELATIONSHIPS

02:05:50.643 --> 02:05:52.645
BRINGS SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN

02:05:52.711 --> 02:05:54.380
ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE TEACHERS

02:05:54.446 --> 02:05:55.648
CAN TEACH MORE EFFECTIVELY

EFFECTIVELY. IN AN ENVIRONMENT

02:06:00.452 --> 02:06:02.788
OF TRUST OF THE LONGING- SOME

02:06:02.855 --> 02:06:04.490
EXPERTS THINK OF THIS IS

02:06:04.556 --> 02:06:05.524
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE DONE FOR

02:06:05.591 --> 02:06:06.992

LOOPING FASHION FOR THE WHOLE

02:06:12.665 --> 02:06:15.234

02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:32.685
THAT ARE REALLY WILL. SOLVE

02:06:32.751 --> 02:06:35.220
JUST. THESE CAN BE YOU IN. WAYS

02:06:35.287 --> 02:06:37.056
AROUND THE CIVIC AREAS OF THE

CURRICULUM OR IN AN ASSESSMENT

02:06:38.991 --> 02:06:41.026
THAT. MIRRORS WHAT WOULD HAVE

CURRICULUM FOR THAT GRADE LEVEL

02:06:50.336 --> 02:06:51.470
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK OF

02:06:51.537 --> 02:06:53.939
THIS AS A DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:56.675
NOT AS A WAY TO LABEL STUDENTS-

02:06:56.742 --> 02:06:59.244

STIGMATIZING LABEL IT ACTUALLY

02:07:07.653 --> 02:07:10.189
AFFECTS THEIR FUTURE WORDING SO

02:07:10.255 --> 02:07:10.956
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BURNING

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:13.258

02:17:07.352 --> 02:17:09.788
HAVE TO DO TO YOU PROVIDED

02:17:09.854 --> 02:17:12.123
DESKTOP RUSHED A STRUCTURE FOR

02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:14.392
LEARNING TO OCCUR I THAT MIGHT

02:17:14.459 --> 02:17:16.661
MEAN AND PROBABLY WILL BE IN A

02:17:16.728 --> 02:17:17.762
DEVELOPING STRUCTURES WHERE

02:17:17.829 --> 02:17:19.097
WE'RE PRACTICING PHYSICAL

02:17:19.164 --> 02:17:21.132
DISTANCE THING. HAVING NO MORE

02:17:21.199 --> 02:17:21.800
THAN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

02:17:21.866 --> 02:17:23.768
STUDENTS IN A CLASSROOM IF

02:17:23.835 --> 02:17:24.669
YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP STUDENTS

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:26.471
SIX FEET APART AS STUDENTS

02:17:26.538 --> 02:17:29.074
ATTENDING SCHOOL- MAYBE NET

02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:31.176
FIVE TIMES A WEEK BUT MAYBE ONE

02:17:31.242 --> 02:17:32.644
TO THREE TIMES A WEEK.

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:33.979
DEPENDING ON THE STUDENTS AND

02:17:34.045 --> 02:17:35.513
THEIR ARRANGEMENT SO IN IN

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:38.783
SUMMARY IT'S ONLY IT'S- LOOKING

02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:40.619
TO HAVE AN EIGHTY ONE FEATHER

02:17:40.685 --> 02:17:42.153
ONE RID THE KIDS OUT OF OUR

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.688
STUDENTS ON CAMPUS OR IN

02:17:43.755 --> 02:17:45.890
CLASSES AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME

02:17:45.957 --> 02:17:49.928
ALSO EXPLORING CONCEPTS LIKE

02:17:49.995 --> 02:17:50.495
BLENDED MODELS THAT WE ARE.

02:17:50.562 --> 02:17:51.363
IT'S PART THE TIME THAT

02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:52.597
STUDENTS BEEN WITH THOSE WILL

02:17:52.664 --> 02:17:54.499
BE ACTUALLY IN THE SCHOOLS AND

02:17:54.566 --> 02:17:55.767
IN THE CLASSES IN PART OF IT

02:17:55.834 --> 02:17:57.936
WILL CONTINUE TO BE ONLINE. AND

02:17:58.003 --> 02:17:59.437
THEN JUST PREPARING FOR WHAT

02:17:59.504 --> 02:18:02.607
WOULD IT UNEXPECTED CLOSURES

02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:04.009
LOOK LIKE IN THE EVENT THAT WE

02:18:04.075 --> 02:18:05.510
HAVE EIGHT COMMUNITIES SPREAD

02:18:05.577 --> 02:18:08.246
HER SCHOOL WIDE CASES OF. OF

02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:10.415
CONFIRMED CASES OF KOBE

02:18:10.482 --> 02:18:11.449
NINETEEN SO WHAT WOULD THAT

02:18:11.516 --> 02:18:13.151
LOOK. LIKE FOR OUR SCHOOL

02:18:13.218 --> 02:18:15.086
SYSTEM WERE NET USED OPERATING

02:18:15.153 --> 02:18:16.855
IN THAT MANNER I SOME OF THE

02:18:16.921 --> 02:18:18.623
CHALLENGES FOR TWENTY TWENTY

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:19.624
ONE THAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING

02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:21.092
WILL BE ON STUDENT WILL BE WITH

02:18:21.159 --> 02:18:22.394
STUDENT ATTENDANCE. OBVIOUSLY

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:24.162
OUR MODEL AND I'LL GET BETTER

02:18:24.229 --> 02:18:26.264
RECOMMENDATIONS ALSO OUR MODEL

02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:27.232
OF A CATHOLIC YOUR STUDENT

02:18:27.298 --> 02:18:29.701
ATTENDANCE I CAN THAT IT REALLY

02:18:29.768 --> 02:18:31.603
DOESN'T TRANSLATE WELL TO OUR

02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:32.637
CURRENT DISTANCE LEARNING

02:18:32.704 --> 02:18:34.806
FORMAT. I WILL ALSO HAVE TO

02:18:34.873 --> 02:18:36.141
CONSIDER WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:40.345
IF WE HAVE. STAFF THAT THE NEED

02:18:40.412 --> 02:18:42.013
OF LEAVE ALSO. THE SERVER SO

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:43.682
STAPP BETTER OVER SIXTY FIVE

02:18:43.748 --> 02:18:44.783
WORK HAVE COMPROMISED IMMUNE

02:18:44.849 --> 02:18:46.818
SYSTEM OR THEY HAVE ELDERLY AT

02:18:46.885 --> 02:18:47.585
HOME THAT THEY'RE WORRIED

02:18:47.652 --> 02:18:49.554
ABOUT. THEIR WORD ABOUT

02:18:49.621 --> 02:18:51.122
INFECTING WHAT WOULD LOOK LIKE

02:18:51.189 --> 02:18:52.757
FOR STAFF THAT WILL BE GONE

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:54.125
PROBABLY MORE THAN WHAT WE'VE

02:18:54.192 --> 02:18:56.394
BEEN USED TO IN THE PAST. I WE

02:18:56.461 --> 02:18:57.562
WILL OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF

02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:59.631
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MITIGATING

02:18:59.698 --> 02:19:01.366
SCHOOL CLOSURE. I IN THIS.

02:19:01.433 --> 02:19:03.535
MITIGATING THAT. CLOSES THE

02:19:03.601 --> 02:19:04.803
PATTERN THAT HAVE OCCURRED THIS

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:06.938
SPRING. AND THE LEARNING LOST

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:08.039
SO WE'RE WE'RE THERE'S

02:19:08.106 --> 02:19:09.374
CONVERSATIONS YOU HEARD IT FROM

02:19:09.441 --> 02:19:11.810
THE PREVIOUS PANELIST. AND THEN

02:19:11.876 --> 02:19:12.977
THE REALITY IS WE HAD A FISCAL

02:19:13.044 --> 02:19:14.913
CRISIS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

02:19:14.979 --> 02:19:17.015
CRISIS WHERE I WOULD SAY

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:18.650
PROBABLY ABOUT 4260% OF THE

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:21.019
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ALREADY WAR

02:19:21.086 --> 02:19:22.854
HAVING STAFF REDUCTION

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:23.888
CONVERSATION I KNOW IN MY

02:19:23.955 --> 02:19:26.224
PERSONAL SITUATION IN FEBRUARY

02:19:26.291 --> 02:19:27.859
WE HAD A RESOLUTION TO THE

02:19:27.926 --> 02:19:28.893
BOARD WHERE WE WERE ELIMINATING

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:31.529
YOU. BETWEEN OUT FORTY FIVE

02:19:31.596 --> 02:19:33.064
FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS

02:19:33.131 --> 02:19:34.632
ON THE CERTIFICATED SIDE OF

02:19:34.699 --> 02:19:38.069
THINGS AND I WAS ONCE AGAIN THE

02:19:38.136 --> 02:19:38.937
CRISIS BEFORE THE CRISIS.

02:19:39.003 --> 02:19:40.839
INDEED THIS THAT HAS DECLINED

02:19:40.905 --> 02:19:44.209
ENROLLMENT. IT'S BEEN. IT'S IT

02:19:44.275 --> 02:19:45.577
WILL PROBABLY BE PROBABLY BEEN

02:19:45.643 --> 02:19:46.711
HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

02:19:46.778 --> 02:19:49.347
REDUCING EXPENDITURES AND WHEN

02:19:49.414 --> 02:19:51.249
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. ROUGHLY

02:19:51.316 --> 02:19:52.817
85% OF YOUR EXPENDITURES OR

02:19:52.884 --> 02:19:53.752
STAFF THAT MEANS REDUCING

02:19:53.818 --> 02:19:55.920
STAFF. SO THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:19:55.987 --> 02:19:57.055
WERE IN THE WORKS BEFORE THE

02:19:57.122 --> 02:19:59.424
CRISIS. AND SOMETIMES THE

02:19:59.491 --> 02:20:01.059
CHALLENGES WITH MITIGATING THE

02:20:01.126 --> 02:20:02.460
LEARNING LOS THAT'S OCCURRING

02:20:02.527 --> 02:20:03.895
RIGHT NOW WILL BE DIFFICULT

02:20:03.962 --> 02:20:05.230
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING

02:20:05.296 --> 02:20:07.365
TIME WHICH MEANS ADDITIONAL

02:20:07.432 --> 02:20:08.767
RESOURCES THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:20:08.833 --> 02:20:09.834
CHALLENGES. THAT THE

02:20:09.901 --> 02:20:11.269
RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:13.438
FOCUS ON. A REALLY THREE YOU'VE

02:20:13.505 --> 02:20:15.306
HEARD IT. YOU'VE HEARD IT A IN

02:20:15.373 --> 02:20:18.076
TERMS OF- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT.

02:20:18.143 --> 02:20:19.344
SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH

02:20:19.411 --> 02:20:21.412
INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES AND

02:20:21.479 --> 02:20:23.148
SCHOOL DAYS FOR STUDENTS ARE

02:20:23.214 --> 02:20:25.450
HAD EVEN QUANTIFY SCHOOL DAY

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:25.884
FOR STUDENTS IN THIS

02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:27.652
ENVIRONMENT. THE FISCAL

02:20:27.719 --> 02:20:29.487
CONSIDERATIONS ARE MAJOR THOSE

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:31.489
ARE MAJOR I WHATEVER AWFULLY

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:33.224
THE GOVERNOR. I HAD THE TWO

02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:35.860
POINT TWO NINE COLA AT- JANUARY

02:20:35.927 --> 02:20:38.396
BUDGET PROPOSAL I THAT WAS DOWN

02:20:38.463 --> 02:20:40.165
FROM A THREE POINT OH- COLA

02:20:40.231 --> 02:20:41.299
THAT WE ARE UTILIZING THE

02:20:41.366 --> 02:20:43.468
PREVIOUS PROJECTIONS. ARE SO

02:20:43.535 --> 02:20:44.936
WHATEVER MAINTENANCE OF A COLOR

02:20:45.003 --> 02:20:47.205
AT LEAST A STATUTORY COLA WOULD

02:20:47.272 --> 02:20:49.707
BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO SCHOOL

02:20:49.774 --> 02:20:51.743
DISTRICT. AS WELL AS THE

02:20:51.810 --> 02:20:53.211
DOLLARS THAT WE'RE GOING TOWARD

FOR LAST YEAR. THAT WAS HELPFUL

02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:07.058
AND IF THAT WOULD CONTINUE THAT

02:21:07.125 --> 02:21:08.493
WOULD BE TREMENDOUS AND MAYBE

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.862
EVEN INCLUDE IN THAT THAT OUR

02:21:10.929 --> 02:21:12.630

BUT MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:30.982
PENSION OBLIGATIONS WOULD BE

02:21:31.049 --> 02:21:33.952
TREMENDOUS THE JUST THE COLA.

02:21:34.018 --> 02:21:36.454
EDUCATION AND THE PENSIONS

02:21:36.521 --> 02:21:37.789

IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON BUT

02:33:20.024 --> 02:33:22.259
THIS CRISIS HAS CAST IN UNDER A

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:24.528
HARSH SPOTLIGHT. WITH SCHOOLS

BECOME GAPS IN STUDENT LEARNING.

02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:32.636
THERE ARE SOME THINGS SCHOOLS

02:33:32.703 --> 02:33:34.171
DISTRICTS AND POLICY MAKERS CAN

02:33:34.238 --> 02:33:35.606

WE EXPAND DIGITAL ACCESS THERE

02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:05.269
IS SIMPLY NO WAY TO CLOSE

02:34:05.336 --> 02:34:06.837
SCHOOL FOR MONTHS WITHOUT

OFFER SCARY PROJECTIONS ABOUT

02:34:29.927 --> 02:34:31.629
WHAT SCHOOL CLOSURES WILL MEAN

02:34:31.695 --> 02:34:32.696
FOR STUDENT LEARNING ESPECIALLY

02:34:32.763 --> 02:34:34.398
WHEN IT COMES TO MATCH.

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:35.833
STUDENTS ARE LIKELY TO LOSE

02:34:35.899 --> 02:34:37.668
HALF OF THEIR USUAL MATH

02:34:37.735 --> 02:34:39.603
LEARNING GAMES AND IN SOME

02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:41.538
GRADES WILL FALL NEARLY A FULL

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:44.408
YEAR BEHIND. READING IMPACTS

WE GONNA GET THAT FROM. IN HERE.

02:43:38.675 --> 02:43:39.209
AND THIS IS THE OTHER THING WE

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:41.144
NEED TO TALK ABOUT. THE LONGER

02:43:41.211 --> 02:43:43.046
THAT WE STAY CLOSE DOWN ON A

02:43:43.113 --> 02:43:45.615
STATE WIDE ORDER. AND I AND I

02:43:45.682 --> 02:43:46.883
UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:48.718
THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WE

02:43:48.785 --> 02:43:50.687
TAKE THOSE VERY SERIOUSLY BUT

02:43:50.754 --> 02:43:52.489
THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS

02:43:52.556 --> 02:43:54.391
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS AS

02:43:54.457 --> 02:43:56.193
WELL. AND IT'S IN OUR EDUCATION

02:43:56.259 --> 02:43:57.994
SYSTEM IT'S IN OUR SOCIAL

02:43:58.061 --> 02:44:00.530
SAFETY NET ALL OF WHICH YOU'RE

02:44:00.597 --> 02:44:03.433
LOOKING A HUGE CUTS- AND SO THE

02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:05.435
LONGER THAT WE STAY UNDER. A

02:44:05.502 --> 02:44:07.938
BLANKET ORDER AND WE DON'T HAVE

02:44:08.004 --> 02:44:10.540
ANY PLANS FREE OPENING THIS

02:44:10.607 --> 02:44:12.576
PROBLEM JUST GETS WORSE THE AT

02:44:12.642 --> 02:44:14.311
THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE. COMING

02:44:14.377 --> 02:44:17.080
INTO. OUR PUBLIC COFFERS TO

02:44:17.147 --> 02:44:18.648
PROVIDE ALL THESE DIFFERENT

02:44:18.715 --> 02:44:20.584
THINGS. IS GOING TO THAT

02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:22.419
PICTURE IS JUST GOING TO GET.

02:44:22.485 --> 02:44:25.922
WORSE SO I THINK WE DO ON THE

02:44:25.989 --> 02:44:26.823
ONE HAND HE TO BE LOOKING AT

02:44:26.890 --> 02:44:28.892
HOW CAN WE SAFELY RE OPEN AS

02:44:28.959 --> 02:44:31.861
MUCH OF THE ECONOMY. SAFELY

02:44:31.928 --> 02:44:33.597
OPEN AS MUCH OF THE ECONOMY AS

02:44:33.663 --> 02:44:35.498
POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN GET.

02:44:35.565 --> 02:44:39.102
OUR REVENUES BACK A. AND I ALSO

02:44:39.169 --> 02:44:40.971
THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

02:44:41.037 --> 02:44:44.241
HE WAS MY COLLEAGUE. FROM SANTA

02:44:44.307 --> 02:44:46.810
BARBARA JUST MENTIONED HOW. IT

02:44:46.876 --> 02:44:47.677
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE

02:44:47.744 --> 02:44:48.778
SHOULD BE PLAN ON DISTANCE

02:44:48.845 --> 02:44:50.113
LEARNING ME IN THE LONG TERM WE

02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:51.281
NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE

02:44:51.348 --> 02:44:53.283
GET. THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH

02:44:53.350 --> 02:44:54.417
SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT

02:44:54.484 --> 02:44:57.687
WERE IDENTIFIED IN THIS PANEL

02:44:57.754 --> 02:45:00.690
IS TO GET KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL-

02:45:00.757 --> 02:45:02.058
YEAH I REALIZE IS GONNA BE

02:45:02.125 --> 02:45:03.493
DIFFERENT DYNAMICS AND INVOLVED

02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:06.396
WITH THAT- BUT IF YOU LOOK AT A

02:45:06.463 --> 02:45:07.397
LOT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:45:07.464 --> 02:45:08.632
INFORMATION THAT'S COMING OUT

02:45:08.698 --> 02:45:09.899
INCLUDING A REPORT THAT CAME

02:45:09.966 --> 02:45:10.834
OUT FROM AMERICAN ENTERPRISE

02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:14.170
INSTITUTE. ONCE YOU GET TO A AT

02:45:14.237 --> 02:45:16.039
A PERIOD WHERE YOU'VE HAD

02:45:16.106 --> 02:45:16.773
FOURTEEN DAYS OF DECLINING

02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:18.875
CASES THEY RECOMMEND THAT YOU

02:45:18.942 --> 02:45:21.144
CAN OPEN FACILITIES INCLUDING

02:45:21.211 --> 02:45:25.015
SCHOOLS SO I THINK WE CAN LOOK

02:45:25.081 --> 02:45:25.615
AT THAT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF

02:45:25.682 --> 02:45:28.585
THE STATE. AND SEE WHERE IT SAY

02:45:28.652 --> 02:45:31.254
TO DO SO WITH PROTOCOLS- TO GET

02:45:31.321 --> 02:45:32.856
KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL BECAUSE

02:45:32.922 --> 02:45:33.823
THAT'S GOING TO DO MORE THAN

02:45:33.890 --> 02:45:35.692
ANYTHING. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:45:35.759 --> 02:45:37.494
MITIGATE THE LEARNING LOS

02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:40.597
THAT'S GOING ON- AND WE

02:45:40.664 --> 02:45:43.066
CERTAINLY DON'T I MEAN I THINK

02:45:43.133 --> 02:45:46.469
THE FISCAL PICTURE. WE CAN'T

02:45:46.536 --> 02:45:47.570
MAKE PROMISES- YEAH THAT WE'RE

02:45:47.637 --> 02:45:48.805
GONNA BE ABLE TO INVEST IN ALL

02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:50.573
KINDS OF STUFF TO HELP MAKE

02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:53.443
DISTANCE LEARNING WORK. I DO I

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:55.478
DON'TSEE WHERE THE MONEY IS.

02:45:55.545 --> 02:45:57.447
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN- CERTAINLY

02:45:57.514 --> 02:45:58.748
WANT TO TRY AND MITIGATE THAT

02:45:58.815 --> 02:46:00.317
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE

02:46:00.383 --> 02:46:02.919
INTERIM BUT WE NEED TO GET DO

02:46:02.986 --> 02:46:04.454
WHAT WE CAN TO GET PEOPLE BACK

02:46:04.521 --> 02:46:07.123
IN SCHOOL- WHERE WE CAN.

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:08.224
CONTINUE THE EDUCATION THAT

02:46:08.291 --> 02:46:11.461
THESE KIDS. YOU KNOW SO

02:46:11.528 --> 02:46:15.332
DESPERATELY NEED. YOU KNOW THE

02:46:15.398 --> 02:46:18.201
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I MEAN

02:46:18.268 --> 02:46:18.968
YEAH YOU WOULD ANSWER THE

INCORRECT INFORMATION- THAT

02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:40.283

02:47:47.223 --> 02:47:49.025
BUT DEFINITELY LOOKING FORWARD

02:47:49.092 --> 02:47:51.494
TO ENGAGING IN THAT

02:47:51.561 --> 02:47:52.228
CONVERSATION ON THE REVISION. I

02:47:52.295 --> 02:47:53.663
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT UNTIL THEN

02:47:53.730 --> 02:47:54.764
I MEAN SINCE WE DON'T HAVE AN

02:47:54.831 --> 02:47:56.399

IT'S A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR

02:48:04.741 --> 02:48:07.177
DECLINE IN REVENUE. A GENERAL

02:48:07.243 --> 02:48:08.778

02:48:16.653 --> 02:48:18.455
UNTIL I HEAR SOMETHING

02:48:18.521 --> 02:48:19.989
SOMETHING DIFFERENT YEAH WELL

02:48:20.056 --> 02:48:21.324
LET ME JUST INTERJECT THERE

02:48:21.391 --> 02:48:22.692
MISTER TAYLOR I THINK AS YOU

02:48:22.759 --> 02:48:24.761
SAID JUST NOW IS IT AS CHAIR

02:48:24.828 --> 02:48:26.262
BUDGET CHAIRMAN TING LUTES

02:48:26.329 --> 02:48:29.599
EARLIER WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC

02:48:29.666 --> 02:48:31.668
AND CAN'T BE. YOU KNOW HI THIS

02:48:31.734 --> 02:48:34.471
GUY IN HAVE A REALITY CHECK

02:48:34.537 --> 02:48:35.972
CONVERSATION. THEY CAN BE NEW

02:48:36.039 --> 02:48:37.607
MONEY ABOVE THE COAL THAT WE

02:48:37.674 --> 02:48:39.375
CAME OUT IN JANUARY PROBABLY

02:48:39.442 --> 02:48:41.377
NOT THE CAN WE KEEP THE COAL IS

02:48:41.444 --> 02:48:42.378
THE AMOUNT THAT WE HAD THERE IN

02:48:42.445 --> 02:48:44.581
JANUARY. THAT I THINK IS

02:48:44.647 --> 02:48:46.349
REALISTIC EVEN WITH THOSE.

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:48.017
THOSE NUMBERS YOU TALK ABOUT IN

02:48:48.084 --> 02:48:48.885
LESS REVENUE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:48:48.952 --> 02:48:51.020
THE THREE. TOOLS A THREE LEGGED

02:48:51.087 --> 02:48:53.223
STOOL IT'S FEDERAL MONEY WE GOT

02:48:53.289 --> 02:48:57.494
ONE. A LOT IN THE FIRST FEDERAL

02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:59.729
CARES. SCHOOL CARES RIGHT YEAH

02:48:59.796 --> 02:49:01.030
THE CARES ALLOCATION WE'RE

02:49:01.097 --> 02:49:02.999
TRYING TO GET AROUND TO WE HAVE

02:49:03.066 --> 02:49:04.567
CERTAINLY ONE TIME MONEY THAT

02:49:04.634 --> 02:49:08.505
WE- STATE RESPONSIBLY PUT AWAY.

02:49:08.571 --> 02:49:10.440
NORTH OF TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS

02:49:10.507 --> 02:49:11.508
AND POTENTIALLY ARE THINGS WE

02:49:11.574 --> 02:49:13.276
CAN DO LIKE DEFERRAL SO. I

02:49:13.343 --> 02:49:15.111
THINK WE SHOULD BE OPTIMISTIC

02:49:15.178 --> 02:49:16.613
AND TALK ABOUT HOW THAT SHOULD

02:49:16.679 --> 02:49:18.815
BE OUR TOP GOAL IS TO ADOPT A

02:49:18.882 --> 02:49:21.484
BUDGET WITH NO CUTS. NO CUTS

02:49:21.551 --> 02:49:22.318
AND EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE THIS

02:49:22.385 --> 02:49:24.053
DID THIS DRASTIC IMPACT GOING

02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:25.622
FROM THE ECONOMY. THAT'S WHY WE

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:27.557
HAVE THESE ARE THINGS IN PLACE.

02:49:27.624 --> 02:49:29.692
TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE TO OUR

02:49:29.759 --> 02:49:31.928
KIDS INTO OUR SCHOOLS. RIGHT

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:33.563
AND I'M ANGRY I WANT TO TRY AND

02:49:33.630 --> 02:49:35.965
KEEP THINGS AS EVEN. KILLED AS

02:49:36.032 --> 02:49:39.969
POSSIBLE. BUT I ALSO NEED TO

02:49:40.036 --> 02:49:41.671
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT THE

02:49:41.738 --> 02:49:43.540
ADMINISTRATION'S IN TENNIS WITH

02:49:43.606 --> 02:49:47.810

WHICH- RIGHT NOW HAS SIXTEEN

02:49:55.051 --> 02:49:57.253
BILLION DOLLARS IN IT. I THINK

02:49:57.320 --> 02:49:58.421
IN REALITY IT'S CLOSER TO

02:49:58.488 --> 02:50:02.091
FOURTEEN BILLION. YOU WHEN YOU

02:50:02.158 --> 02:50:03.259
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT'S GONNA

02:50:03.326 --> 02:50:05.295
HAPPEN THIS YEAR- IN TERMS OF

02:50:05.361 --> 02:50:10.700
THE BALANCE. WHAT WE CAN'T WE

02:50:10.767 --> 02:50:12.635
PROBABLY CAN'T USE ALL OF THAT

02:50:12.702 --> 02:50:14.270
IN ONE YEAR BECAUSE WE ARE

02:50:14.337 --> 02:50:15.538
PROBABLY LOOKING AT A CONTINUED

02:50:15.605 --> 02:50:18.808
RECESSION. AND THE FUTURE YEARS

02:50:18.875 --> 02:50:20.109

ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN DO YOU

02:50:21.744 --> 02:50:22.612
BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE

02:50:22.679 --> 02:50:24.747
CONDITIONS OR LIMITS. OPERATIVE

02:50:24.814 --> 02:50:26.983
FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE

02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:30.119

02:50:35.692 --> 02:50:37.360
AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO SUPPORT

02:50:37.427 --> 02:50:44.467
REVENUES. SO AGAIN AND I

02:50:44.534 --> 02:50:45.802
APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A BROKEN

02:50:45.868 --> 02:50:47.303

02:50:47.370 --> 02:50:48.404
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SPEAK TO

02:50:48.471 --> 02:50:50.640
RIGHT NOW- DEFINITELY SOMETHING

02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:51.240

MAKING PROCESS OBVIOUSLY. WE

02:51:18.901 --> 02:51:19.836

OPEN UP FACILITIES THAT I KNOW

02:53:28.698 --> 02:53:29.165
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS

02:53:29.232 --> 02:53:30.967
LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT THE

02:53:31.033 --> 02:53:32.568
CRITERIA FOR THAT AND I THINK

02:53:32.635 --> 02:53:34.737
THE NEXT THING THAT WE CAN DO

02:53:34.804 --> 02:53:36.839
IS SUPPORT. OF BOTH THROUGH THE

02:53:36.906 --> 02:53:38.207
CARES ACT WHICH ALLOWS FOR

02:53:38.274 --> 02:53:40.176
THEIR SEND IN WHATEVER OTHER

02:53:40.243 --> 02:53:42.478
WAYS ARE POSSIBLE- FUNDING FOR

02:53:42.545 --> 02:53:44.046
SUMMER SCHOOL AS WE HAVE DONE

02:53:44.113 --> 02:53:46.516
IN THE PAST IN THE STATE TO

02:53:46.582 --> 02:53:49.385
ENABLE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES-

02:53:49.452 --> 02:53:51.187
DISTRICTS MAY BRING TOGETHER

02:53:51.254 --> 02:53:54.056
SMALL GROUPS OF STUDENTS OF FOR

02:53:54.123 --> 02:53:56.058
TARGETED WORK ON YOU KNOW

02:53:56.125 --> 02:53:58.194
PARTICULAR- AREAS OF THE

02:53:58.261 --> 02:54:00.363
CURRICULUM MORE SKILLS AND THEY

02:54:00.429 --> 02:54:02.431
MAY DO A COMBINATION OF A

02:54:02.498 --> 02:54:04.667
DISTANCE LEARNING AND- IN

02:54:04.734 --> 02:54:07.436
PERSON LEARNING THERE ARE SOME

02:54:07.503 --> 02:54:10.973
COUNTY OFFICES DEVELOPING A

02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:13.376
STRONG. RESOURCES FOR OUR

02:54:13.442 --> 02:54:15.411
ONLINE OF SUMMER SCHOOL

02:54:15.478 --> 02:54:16.879
LEARNING AS WELL AS FOR IN

02:54:16.946 --> 02:54:19.482
PERSON. THERE ARE CERTAIN KINDS

02:54:19.549 --> 02:54:22.351
OF- STRATEGIES SPECIFIC TO

02:54:22.418 --> 02:54:24.620
LITERACY DEVELOPMENT. SPECIFIC

02:54:24.687 --> 02:54:28.391
TO- MATH. DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE

02:54:28.457 --> 02:54:32.228
WELL BEDDED AND CAN BE- MADE

02:54:32.295 --> 02:54:34.664
AVAILABLE TO. YOUR DISTRICTS

02:54:34.730 --> 02:54:36.032
AND SCHOOLS THAT WANT TO USE

02:54:36.098 --> 02:54:38.134
THEM. I THINK IF THERE BE A

02:54:38.201 --> 02:54:39.502
VARIETY OF WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN

02:54:39.569 --> 02:54:43.105
APPROACH IT THAT. IT

02:54:43.172 --> 02:54:44.740
DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT PLACES

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:46.442
WHATEVER WE DO IN PERSON WILL

02:54:46.509 --> 02:54:48.277
HAVE TO HAVE SOCIAL DISTANCING

02:54:48.344 --> 02:54:49.979
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:54:50.046 --> 02:54:51.013
STUDYING WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:54.350
DO OF WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY. A

02:54:54.417 --> 02:54:56.786
RE OPENED SCHOOLS OR MAINTAINED

02:54:56.853 --> 02:54:59.856
SCHOOLS OPEN THAT WILL- WE ALSO

02:54:59.922 --> 02:55:01.490
CHILD CARE FACILITIES ARE USING

02:55:01.557 --> 02:55:03.025
SOME OF THOSE STRATEGIES

02:55:03.092 --> 02:55:05.228
ALREADY AND SO THAT MAY MEAN

02:55:05.294 --> 02:55:10.666
THAT WE CAN'T. ACCOMMODATE.

02:55:10.733 --> 02:55:12.869
CLASSROOMS FOR FOLKS SITTING

02:55:12.935 --> 02:55:16.038
CLOSE TOGETHER BUT OF TYPICALLY

02:55:16.105 --> 02:55:16.839
IN SUMMER SCHOOL THERE ARE

02:55:16.906 --> 02:55:18.975
SMALLER GROUPS. AS PART OF IT

02:55:19.041 --> 02:55:21.477
SO WILL BE A GOOD TEST CASE FOR

02:55:21.544 --> 02:55:26.082
THE HYGIENE AND SPACING AND-

02:55:26.148 --> 02:55:28.251
CLEANING STRATEGIES THAT WILL

02:55:28.317 --> 02:55:30.253
BE NEEDED IN THE SCHOOL YEAR

02:55:30.319 --> 02:55:32.889
ASSUMING WE CAN MOVE FORWARD BY

02:55:32.955 --> 02:55:39.962
THEN TO FULL SCHOOL OPENING.

02:55:40.029 --> 02:55:42.098
ANYBODY ELSE WANT. QUESTION IS

02:55:42.164 --> 02:55:44.500
IF WE DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:55:44.567 --> 02:55:47.603
IN THIS BUDGET TO PROVIDE OF

02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:49.572
COURSE WANT TO COVER THE BASIC

02:55:49.639 --> 02:55:51.908
FUNDING INCLUDING. THE PROPOSE

02:55:51.974 --> 02:55:53.709
COLA FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IF WE

02:55:53.776 --> 02:55:57.079
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A- OUT

02:55:57.146 --> 02:56:00.116
LEARNING LAS BLOCK GRANTS.

02:56:00.182 --> 02:56:00.583
THROUGH THE THROUGHOUT

02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:02.351
CALIFORNIA. WHAT WOULD THAT

02:56:02.418 --> 02:56:05.054
LOOK LIKE TO HELP THE DEAL WITH

02:56:05.121 --> 02:56:06.789
THAT THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

02:56:06.856 --> 02:56:08.858
NOW SO YOU KNOW USUALLY WE

02:56:08.925 --> 02:56:10.359
PASSED THE BUDGET WE GIVE

02:56:10.426 --> 02:56:11.460
RESOURCE THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:56:11.527 --> 02:56:13.562
EDUCATION NO OFFENSE DEPARTMENT

02:56:13.629 --> 02:56:15.097
OF THAT IT TAKES FOUR MONTHS TO

02:56:15.164 --> 02:56:17.466
GET THE R. P. TOGETHER. SENATE

02:56:17.533 --> 02:56:19.769
OUT IN NOVEMBER APPLICATIONS

02:56:19.835 --> 02:56:20.937
COMMAND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

02:56:21.003 --> 02:56:22.038
SEVENTH EIGHTH MONTH AT THE

02:56:22.104 --> 02:56:23.706
FISCAL YEAR BEFORE WE STARTED

02:56:23.773 --> 02:56:26.042
SO THE IDEA HERE IS WE- PUT

02:56:26.108 --> 02:56:27.410
SOME MONEY TOGETHER AND WE WANT

02:56:27.476 --> 02:56:29.211
TO START RIGHT DAYS AFTER THE

02:56:29.278 --> 02:56:31.881
JULY ONE FISCAL YEAR TO DEAL

02:56:31.948 --> 02:56:33.382
WITH THE FACT THAT. LOOK THERE

02:56:33.449 --> 02:56:35.718
I'VE TALKED SO MY COLLEAGUES

02:56:35.785 --> 02:56:39.155
AND THEY SAY. 50% THE KIDS

02:56:39.221 --> 02:56:41.123
HAVING FOUND THEM HAVEN'T THEY

02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:42.091
BEEN CALL ON THE OTHER OVER

02:56:42.158 --> 02:56:43.259
THERE AT THAT CAN GIVE THEM

02:56:43.326 --> 02:56:45.361
CHROMEBOOKS AND HOT SPOTS AND

02:56:45.428 --> 02:56:46.729
SO FOR THAT I AM IN AROUND AND

02:56:46.796 --> 02:56:49.231
SO. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT

02:56:49.298 --> 02:56:51.434
REALITY AS WELL SO. IF WE WHAT

02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:53.402
WOULD IT LOOK LIKE AND HOW CAN

02:56:53.469 --> 02:56:53.970
WE CREATE SOMETHING THAT WE

02:56:54.036 --> 02:56:57.707
COULD START. JULY ONE RIGHT

02:56:57.773 --> 02:57:00.276
AWAY TO HELP DEALING WITH- BUT

02:57:00.343 --> 02:57:01.544
WE'VE SEEN WITH THIS LEARNING

02:57:01.610 --> 02:57:03.579
LOS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIANS SO

02:57:03.646 --> 02:57:06.716
MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I

02:57:06.782 --> 02:57:09.185
DON'T WANT TO OUR PREEMPTS THE

02:57:09.251 --> 02:57:11.420
CD RESPONSE ON HOW THEY WOULD

02:57:11.487 --> 02:57:12.288
GET THE MONEY AT THE DOOR BUT

02:57:12.355 --> 02:57:14.857
I'LL JUST NOTE THAT- SOME YEARS

02:57:14.924 --> 02:57:17.360
AGO WE HAD A SUMMER SCHOOL OF

02:57:17.426 --> 02:57:19.328
EXPECTATION IN PART OF MONEY.

02:57:19.395 --> 02:57:20.596
IT WAS VERY EASY FOR DISTRICTS

02:57:20.663 --> 02:57:22.398
TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE

02:57:22.465 --> 02:57:24.033
YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF EDUCATION

02:57:24.100 --> 02:57:25.968
FOR THIS MANY KIDS APPLICATION

02:57:26.035 --> 02:57:28.070
WAS SIMPLE THE FUNDING WAS CUED

02:57:28.137 --> 02:57:29.939
UP AND READY TO GO SO OBVIOUSLY

02:57:30.006 --> 02:57:34.443
DOESN'T NEED TO- TAKE. A LONG

02:57:34.510 --> 02:57:36.312
TIME TO DO THAT IF THERE IS A

02:57:36.379 --> 02:57:38.414
FRAMEWORK IN PLACE THAT PEOPLE

02:57:38.481 --> 02:57:43.386
AND- SIMPLY FEED INTO. AND

02:57:43.452 --> 02:57:44.820
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THIS IS

02:57:44.887 --> 02:57:47.490
STERILE CAMP AGAIN I'M NOT MY

02:57:47.556 --> 02:57:49.558
SUGGESTION WOULD BE FLEXIBILITY

02:57:49.625 --> 02:57:50.760
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME

02:57:50.826 --> 02:57:52.228
TYPE OF A BLOCK GRANT TO

02:57:52.294 --> 02:57:54.497
MITIGATE THAT LEARNING OFFICE

02:57:54.563 --> 02:57:55.664
HAPPENING NOW I WOULD JUST

02:57:55.731 --> 02:57:57.199
EMPHASIZE FLEXIBILITY AS YOU

02:57:57.266 --> 02:57:58.768
MENTIONED THAT THOUSAND SCHOOL

02:57:58.834 --> 02:58:00.903
DISTRICTS CALIFORNIA ALL OF US

02:58:00.970 --> 02:58:02.204
ARE AT DIFFERENT PLACES SOME OF

02:58:02.271 --> 02:58:05.107
US PROBABLY HAVE PLANS THAT

02:58:05.174 --> 02:58:06.809
HAVE THE WHOLE SUMMER SCHOOL

02:58:06.876 --> 02:58:09.278
DURING STOP WHEN HE TWENTY I

02:58:09.345 --> 02:58:10.846
SOME OF US WERE REDUCING SUMMER

02:58:10.913 --> 02:58:12.448
SCHOOL FOR TWENTY TWENTY DUE TO

02:58:12.515 --> 02:58:14.150
THAT THE FISCAL CRISIS BEFORE

02:58:14.216 --> 02:58:16.118
THE PANDEMIC CRISIS. AND SO I

02:58:16.185 --> 02:58:18.220
WOULD LIKE IT'S THE IF THERE'S

02:58:18.287 --> 02:58:20.122
A BLACK GRANT SOME TYPE OF

02:58:20.189 --> 02:58:22.691
FLEXIBILITY WHERE WE GETNOT

02:58:22.758 --> 02:58:24.894
JUST THINK ABOUT SUMMER OF

02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:25.461
TWENTY TWENTY I MANY OF OUR

02:58:25.528 --> 02:58:27.396
STUDENTS WILL BE WITH US FOR

02:58:27.463 --> 02:58:29.231
MULTIPLE SCHOOL YEARS AND

02:58:29.298 --> 02:58:30.366
THAT'S WHERE SETTING THEIR

02:58:30.433 --> 02:58:32.234
LEARNING NEEDS A MOVING FORWARD

02:58:32.301 --> 02:58:33.736
I WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

02:58:33.803 --> 02:58:34.970
CATCHING UP IN IN MITIGATING

02:58:35.037 --> 02:58:37.073
SUMMER LAW YES CURRENT ART IT

02:58:37.139 --> 02:58:38.541
AGAIN IN THE LEARNING LOS JUST

02:58:38.607 --> 02:58:40.109
DURING THE SUMMER AS MUCH

02:58:40.176 --> 02:58:43.045
FLEXIBILITY WOULD BE HURTS YOU

02:58:43.112 --> 02:58:45.214
CAN YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TRYING

02:58:45.281 --> 02:58:47.516
TO MITIGATE SUMMER LEARNING

02:58:47.583 --> 02:58:48.184
LOSS FOR YEARS DURING THE

02:58:48.250 --> 02:58:49.985
SCHOOL YEAR. AND I DON'T WANT

02:58:50.052 --> 02:58:51.287
TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE AND IT IS

02:58:51.353 --> 02:58:52.988
AN OPPORTUNITY TO OFF THE TABLE

02:58:53.055 --> 02:58:54.757
AS WE ADJUST TO OUR OUR NEW NOR

02:58:54.824 --> 02:58:56.258
THE ONCE AGAIN FLEXIBILITY I

02:58:56.325 --> 02:59:01.530
THINK WOULD BE. WOULD BE. OKAY

02:59:01.597 --> 02:59:04.433
PARTY THIS. TO BORED ALL. OUT

02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:05.534
WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE STARTING

02:59:05.601 --> 02:59:07.470
THAT ARE YEAR ROUND SCHOOLS. IN

02:59:07.536 --> 02:59:09.038
THEY ACTUALLY START MIDDLE JULY

02:59:09.105 --> 02:59:10.506
SO THAT FLEXIBILITY WOULD BE

02:59:10.573 --> 02:59:12.241
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- DURING

02:59:12.308 --> 02:59:13.476
A TIME WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR

02:59:13.542 --> 02:59:14.743
BREAKS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

02:59:14.810 --> 02:59:16.378
THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY OFFER

02:59:16.445 --> 02:59:17.880
EXTRA LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES

02:59:17.947 --> 02:59:19.081
FOR THE STUDENTS DURING THAT

02:59:19.148 --> 02:59:20.249
MONTH OP WHEN THEY HAVE THAT

02:59:20.316 --> 02:59:22.251
TIME. SO WE WERE JUST TO SAY

02:59:22.318 --> 02:59:23.352
IT'S GOING TO BE JUST OVER. THE

02:59:23.419 --> 02:59:25.421
SUMMER TIME. THAT WOULD NOT

02:59:25.488 --> 02:59:27.189
HELP THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN

02:59:27.256 --> 02:59:28.023
THE YEAR ROUND SETTING ARE

02:59:28.090 --> 02:59:30.226
READY. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:59:30.292 --> 02:59:31.060
STARTING UP THE SCHOOL YEAR

02:59:31.127 --> 02:59:33.429
EARLIER. IF WE START SOME

02:59:33.496 --> 02:59:35.431
SCHOOLS START ALREADY IN JULY.

02:59:35.498 --> 02:59:37.032
YOU'RE TALKING JUNE IN JUNE IS

02:59:37.099 --> 02:59:39.235
A SOMEWHAT THE WAY AND THEY AND

02:59:39.301 --> 02:59:39.802
SCHOOLS JUST DON'T HAVE THE

02:59:39.869 --> 02:59:41.403
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN. AND THE

02:59:41.470 --> 02:59:42.938
EDUCATORS CAN'T PUT THE INPUT

02:59:43.005 --> 02:59:44.106
AND THAT'S- NOR TO MAKE IT

02:59:44.173 --> 02:59:46.509
SUCCESSFUL. SO THE FLEXIBLE IS

02:59:46.575 --> 02:59:48.244
GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT. AND

02:59:48.310 --> 02:59:49.745
YOU KNOW WHATEVER WE DO YOU

02:59:49.812 --> 02:59:51.847
JUST MAKE SURE THE EDUCATORS

02:59:51.914 --> 02:59:52.648
PARENTS ARE AT THE TABLE MAKE

02:59:52.715 --> 02:59:55.184
SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE- BEST

02:59:55.251 --> 02:59:58.888
FOR STUDENTS. HEATHER HELP WITH

02:59:58.954 --> 03:00:00.689
A I THINK IT ANOTHER REALLY

03:00:00.756 --> 03:00:02.491
IMPORTANT THING TO HIGHLIGHT.

03:00:02.558 --> 03:00:07.263
SO YOU THE SAME ACTION. ANY AND

03:00:07.329 --> 03:00:10.132
AT RIGHT RIGHT I'M NOT HERE I

03:00:10.199 --> 03:00:13.869
KNOW I THINK MOST ANECDOTAL AT

03:00:13.936 --> 03:00:20.843
A WIDE. A EIGHT WHAT RIGHT YOUR-

03:00:20.910 --> 03:00:26.582
AND YOU OFFER A- ON YOU NEED

03:00:26.649 --> 03:00:30.219
BETTER ARTICLE THANK YOU BOTH

03:00:30.286 --> 03:00:35.691
AND THEIR IN. THERE ARE GREAT

03:00:35.758 --> 03:00:38.360
OF WHAT YOU HAVE OVER MONTHS

03:00:38.427 --> 03:00:50.573
RIGHT NOW AT HOW. BEEN ABLE I

03:00:50.639 --> 03:00:55.744
ACCESS. SO THAT THAT IN MONEY

03:00:55.811 --> 03:01:00.349
IN REALLY REACHING WARMER. YEAH

03:01:00.416 --> 03:01:01.917
AND HOW LONG HAVE A THIS IS

03:01:01.984 --> 03:01:02.518
ALICIA I THINK ONE OF THE IS

03:01:02.585 --> 03:01:03.886
GOING TO AND WITH BLACK GRANTS

03:01:03.953 --> 03:01:05.454
TO MAKE SURE THE ALLOCATIONS

03:01:05.521 --> 03:01:07.656
ARE WAITED TO ENSURE TO

03:01:07.723 --> 03:01:08.290
HEATHER'S POINT THAT THE

03:01:08.357 --> 03:01:10.593
STUDENTS WHO NEED THE SUPPORT

03:01:10.659 --> 03:01:11.493
AND THE DISTRICTS SENDING THE

03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:12.995
MOST SUPPORT ARE GETTING THOSE

03:01:13.062 --> 03:01:15.798
RESOURCES- AND ENSURING THAT

03:01:15.864 --> 03:01:18.500
THOSE ALLOCATIONS ARE WAITED IN

03:01:18.567 --> 03:01:25.574
SUCH A WAY THAT THAT HAPPENS.

03:01:25.641 --> 03:01:26.976
OKAY THANK YOU I'M GONNA TURN

03:01:27.042 --> 03:01:29.078

03:01:32.648 --> 03:01:34.149
SAID EARLIER AND I'LL SAY IT

03:01:34.216 --> 03:01:36.485
AGAIN THIS IS AT A TOP PRIORITY

03:01:36.552 --> 03:01:40.022
AT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE ALSO. THE

03:01:40.089 --> 03:01:42.224
ASSEMBLY IS TRYING TO. COME UP

03:01:42.291 --> 03:01:43.125
WITH A BUDGET THAT KEEPS US

03:01:43.192 --> 03:01:45.494
RECALL BUT RECOGNIZE EVEN HOLE

03:01:45.561 --> 03:01:47.029
WE'VE HAD SOME DAMAGE ACROSS

03:01:47.096 --> 03:01:49.665
CALIFORNIA SOME STUDENTS ARE

03:01:49.732 --> 03:01:52.301
REALLY BEHIND. AND AS WE SEE

03:01:52.368 --> 03:01:53.836
FROM THEIR RESEARCH FROM THAT

03:01:53.902 --> 03:01:56.372
TRUST WES IT'S- CERTAINLY IN

03:01:56.438 --> 03:01:57.439
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WE KNOW

03:01:57.506 --> 03:01:58.841
THAT IT'S EVEN WORSE AND SO WE

03:01:58.907 --> 03:02:00.409
NEED TO BE MINDFUL THAT AND TRY

03:02:00.476 --> 03:02:02.745
TO PROVIDE. FLEXIBILITY AS WE

03:02:02.811 --> 03:02:05.014
HEARD JUST NOW FOR DISTRICTS

03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:07.950
AND SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS THIS-

03:02:08.017 --> 03:02:10.019
BEFORE KIDS GET BACK AT IT THIS

03:02:10.085 --> 03:02:11.854
FALL ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL.

03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:12.988
YES AT THANK YOU MISTER

03:02:13.055 --> 03:02:14.290
CHAIRMAN JUST WITH REGARD TO

03:02:14.356 --> 03:02:15.658
YOUR YOUR DISCUSSION OF SUMMER

03:02:15.724 --> 03:02:17.293
SCHOOL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE JUST

03:02:17.359 --> 03:02:18.861
SITTING HERE TODAY ESPECIALLY

03:02:18.927 --> 03:02:20.596
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HIGH

03:02:20.663 --> 03:02:23.365
SCHOOL LEVEL- SUMMER SCHOOL IS

03:02:23.432 --> 03:02:25.067
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN JUST

03:02:25.134 --> 03:02:26.935
STARTING THE SCHOOL YEAR EARLY-

03:02:27.002 --> 03:02:28.237
WHY. BECAUSE A HIGH SCHOOL

03:02:28.304 --> 03:02:30.406
TEACHER I THINK OF CREDITS I

03:02:30.472 --> 03:02:32.174
THINK OF CREDIT. DEFICIENCY AND

03:02:32.241 --> 03:02:34.877
I THINK OF GPA. SO I KNOW WE

03:02:34.943 --> 03:02:35.944
TALKED ABOUT SUMMER SCHOOL SOME

03:02:36.011 --> 03:02:36.945
FOLKS ARE JUST WORRIED ABOUT

03:02:37.012 --> 03:02:40.149
THOSE KIDS WHO ARE MAYBE CREDIT

03:02:40.215 --> 03:02:40.683
DEFICIENT AND WE SHOULD BE

03:02:40.749 --> 03:02:41.984
WORRIED ABOUT THOSE KIDS. BUT

03:02:42.051 --> 03:02:44.653
WE SHOULD ALSO- FOCUS ON THOSE

03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:45.854
STUDENTS AND A KIND OF THE

03:02:45.921 --> 03:02:47.556
WATER. THEY MIGHT NEED TO BUMP

03:02:47.623 --> 03:02:49.725
UP THEIR GPA A BET TO GET INTO

03:02:49.792 --> 03:02:51.293
COLLEGE NEXT YEAR. OR THE YEAR

03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:53.429
AFTER- SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS

03:02:53.495 --> 03:02:55.531
HAVE GONE TO CREDIT NO CREDIT-

03:02:55.597 --> 03:02:57.132
THAT'S OKAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

03:02:57.199 --> 03:02:58.400
I OWN LOCAL DISTRICT AT THAT

03:02:58.467 --> 03:03:00.035
BUT NEXT DOOR DOWNEY. I THINK

03:03:00.102 --> 03:03:01.303
THEY HAVE IT WHAT THEY DID WAS

03:03:01.370 --> 03:03:02.471
THEY WANT TO CREDIT NO CREDIT

03:03:02.538 --> 03:03:04.540
AND THEN STUDENT CAN CHOOSE TO

03:03:04.606 --> 03:03:07.176
BE GRADED. IF THEY SO DESIRE

03:03:07.242 --> 03:03:09.445
BUT WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT FOR

03:03:09.511 --> 03:03:10.979
SOME OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE.

03:03:11.046 --> 03:03:12.381
ARE REALLY YOU DON'T TRY TO

03:03:12.448 --> 03:03:14.516
PUSH THEIR GPA UP AND GET INTO

03:03:14.583 --> 03:03:16.552
A CERTAIN COLLEGE THEY NEED.

03:03:16.618 --> 03:03:18.320
THE GPA NUMBERS THEY DON'T NEED

03:03:18.387 --> 03:03:19.188
A CREDIT NO CREDIT THEY'RE

03:03:19.254 --> 03:03:20.823
GOING TO PASS. BUT THEY NEED

03:03:20.889 --> 03:03:22.291
THE GPA NUMBER SO I REALLY

03:03:22.358 --> 03:03:23.826
ENCOURAGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

03:03:23.892 --> 03:03:24.426
ACROSS THE STATE OF ENCOURAGE

03:03:24.493 --> 03:03:27.363
MY OWN. QUITE FRANKLY TO- TO

03:03:27.429 --> 03:03:28.597
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WELL WHAT

03:03:28.664 --> 03:03:29.732
I'LL CALL THE DOWNEY MODEL SOME

03:03:29.798 --> 03:03:30.899
DISTRICTS ALREADY MIGHT BE

03:03:30.966 --> 03:03:32.801
IMPLYING THAT MODEL AS WELL. IN

03:03:32.868 --> 03:03:35.104
FACT I THINK THEY ARE WITH

03:03:35.170 --> 03:03:36.405
REGARD TO ACCESS AND

03:03:36.472 --> 03:03:39.475
CONNECTIVITY. I THOUGHT I HEARD

03:03:39.541 --> 03:03:41.143
THE NUMBERS REFLECTED THAT YOU

03:03:41.210 --> 03:03:42.945
KNOW FOR HER THOUSAND STUDENTS

03:03:43.011 --> 03:03:44.880
DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ONLINE

03:03:44.947 --> 03:03:46.148
LEARNING BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT

03:03:46.215 --> 03:03:47.383
HAVE THE DEVICE THEY MIGHT NOT

03:03:47.449 --> 03:03:51.019
HAVE- THE- THE HOT SPOT

03:03:51.086 --> 03:03:52.755
WHATEVER IT MAY BE THOSE

03:03:52.821 --> 03:03:54.490
NUMBERS ARE LARGE BUT REMEMBER

03:03:54.556 --> 03:03:56.425
WE DO HAVE SIX WHAT SIX POINT

03:03:56.492 --> 03:03:57.226
TWO MILLION STUDENTS IN THE

03:03:57.292 --> 03:03:59.962
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I WE

03:04:00.028 --> 03:04:01.029
CERTAINLY NEED TO FOCUS ON

03:04:01.096 --> 03:04:02.998
THOSE THOSE FOUR HUNDRED

03:04:03.065 --> 03:04:03.499
THOUSAND WE HAVE ANOTHER

03:04:03.565 --> 03:04:04.066
PROBLEM IS REALLY A SOCIAL

03:04:04.133 --> 03:04:06.702
PROBLEM BEYOND- CONNECTIVITY IS

03:04:06.769 --> 03:04:08.170
NOT SUCH A TANGIBLE PROBLEM

03:04:08.237 --> 03:04:10.139
AGAIN AS IT IS A SOCIAL PROBLEM

03:04:10.205 --> 03:04:11.907
AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE.

03:04:11.974 --> 03:04:13.275
HANDING OUT DEVICES AND THEN

03:04:13.342 --> 03:04:15.210
THE KIDS NEVER GET ON THEM-

03:04:15.277 --> 03:04:16.578
BECAUSE OF SITUATIONS AT HOME

03:04:16.645 --> 03:04:17.813
SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW

03:04:17.880 --> 03:04:19.848
WE THE ADDRESS US WE JUST CAN'T

03:04:19.915 --> 03:04:21.717
POINT IT HANDING OUT COMPUTERS

03:04:21.784 --> 03:04:23.252
AS THE SOLE SOLUTION THAT

03:04:23.318 --> 03:04:24.153
SEEMED LIKE PART OF THE

03:04:24.219 --> 03:04:25.120
SOLUTION FOR SURE. AND THAT'S

03:04:25.187 --> 03:04:26.388
HAPPENED BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU

03:04:26.455 --> 03:04:27.322
I ONE BY ONE OF OUR HIGH

03:04:27.389 --> 03:04:28.624
SCHOOLS THERE WAS THOUSANDS OF

03:04:28.690 --> 03:04:30.526
PEOPLE IN LINE AND THEY WERE

03:04:30.592 --> 03:04:33.095
ALL GETTING COMPUTERS. BUT THE

03:04:33.162 --> 03:04:34.897
NEXT STEP IS THEY NEED TO

03:04:34.963 --> 03:04:37.099
ACCESS THE ONLINE LEARNING FROM

03:04:37.166 --> 03:04:38.300
FROM HOME AND I REALIZE OUR

03:04:38.367 --> 03:04:39.535
SITUATIONS OR THAT CAN BE VERY

03:04:39.601 --> 03:04:41.203
DIFFICULT AND THAT IS WHAT HOW

03:04:41.270 --> 03:04:42.771
IDENTIFY THE SOCIAL PROBLEM OF

03:04:42.838 --> 03:04:46.542
THAT- WHAT ELSE DID I WANT TO

03:04:46.608 --> 03:04:49.244
TALK ABOUT HERE- AND THEN RE

03:04:49.311 --> 03:04:50.679
OPENING SCHOOLS WE TALK ABOUT

03:04:50.746 --> 03:04:51.613
RE OPEN THE SCHOOLS I HOPE WE

03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:53.282
PAY ATTENTION THE DIVERSITY OF

03:04:53.348 --> 03:04:55.050
CALIFORNIA. CERTAINLY IN PEOPLE

03:04:55.117 --> 03:04:57.853
BUT ALSO IN GEOGRAPHY- IT MIGHT

03:04:57.920 --> 03:04:59.354
BE APPROPRIATE FOR SOME SCHOOL

03:04:59.421 --> 03:05:01.123
DISTRICTS TO RE OPEN AND NOT

03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:02.691
SOMEOTHERS WE SHOULDN'T JUST

03:05:02.758 --> 03:05:04.760
HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

03:05:04.827 --> 03:05:06.195
APPROACH NO I'M NOT OUT OF THE

03:05:06.261 --> 03:05:07.196
ON BOARD WITH MR GALLAGHER'S

03:05:07.262 --> 03:05:10.432
APPROACH GOD LOVE HIM. BUT WE

03:05:10.499 --> 03:05:11.633
APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS ON

03:05:11.700 --> 03:05:14.369
THAT BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO

03:05:14.436 --> 03:05:17.105
THINK ABOUT YOU THERE SO SCHOOL

03:05:17.172 --> 03:05:19.208
WORK DRIVE THEY GET THE BUST ON

03:05:19.274 --> 03:05:22.177
A BUS OR TO A- TO GET SCHOOL.

03:05:22.244 --> 03:05:25.113
AND SO. IN OF THE JUSTICE THERE

03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:26.615
THEY THEIR THEY'RE IN PLACE FOR

03:05:26.682 --> 03:05:28.083
THE SCHOOLS ARE VERY LARGE AND

03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:29.685
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE- YOU KNOW

03:05:29.751 --> 03:05:31.353
ITREAL DENSE POPULATION WERE

03:05:31.420 --> 03:05:33.188
MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:36.325
SCHOOLS TO RE OPEN. EVERY DAY-

03:05:36.391 --> 03:05:37.926
AND IT MIGHT NOT BE APPROPRIATE

03:05:37.993 --> 03:05:39.361
IN A MORE URBAN AREA I DON'T

03:05:39.428 --> 03:05:44.032
HAVE. THE SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE

03:05:44.099 --> 03:05:45.067
TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S

03:05:45.133 --> 03:05:46.068
ACTOR BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY

03:05:46.134 --> 03:05:47.603
SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO THINK

03:05:47.669 --> 03:05:48.303
ABOUT IT SHOULDN'T BE JUST

03:05:48.370 --> 03:05:53.308
AGAIN. A ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND

03:05:53.375 --> 03:05:54.409
JUST ONE QUESTION MAYBE FOR THE

03:05:54.476 --> 03:05:56.411

03:06:01.483 --> 03:06:03.519
PLAN TO DO THAT NOW. MAYBE

03:06:03.585 --> 03:06:08.824
SOMEONE COULD COMMENT ON THAT.

03:06:08.891 --> 03:06:10.192
AND THE CHAIRS IN HERE SO IF

NOT SIGNED UP FOR THAT AND

03:07:01.343 --> 03:07:02.611
MAYBE WE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION

03:07:02.678 --> 03:07:04.179
TO THOSE DISTRICTS BECAUSE I.

03:07:04.246 --> 03:07:05.714

MEALS AND THAT BECAME A REAL

03:07:12.087 --> 03:07:12.888

MALES IN THAT COMMUNITY I WANNA

03:07:43.952 --> 03:07:44.920

CONVERSATION IS NOT HARD TO SEE

03:08:13.048 --> 03:08:15.550
WHY I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE

03:08:15.617 --> 03:08:19.855

SHORT TIME FRAME THAT ALSO

NEEDS MET. ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT

03:19:56.551 --> 03:19:58.052
IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK

03:19:58.119 --> 03:19:59.454
FORCE AND THE DONATIONS FOR

03:19:59.520 --> 03:20:01.322

AS DEVELOPING THAT CONTINUITY

03:22:07.849 --> 03:22:09.717
PLAN OF WHAT THAT HYBRID

03:22:09.784 --> 03:22:11.486
SITUATION COULD LOOK LIKE YEAH

03:22:11.552 --> 03:22:12.720
THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO THE

03:22:12.787 --> 03:22:14.822
PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN-

03:22:14.889 --> 03:22:18.192

03:22:20.194 --> 03:22:21.963
FROM THIS PANDEMIC CAN.

03:22:22.029 --> 03:22:24.165
TRANSLATE INTO HOW WE SERVE

03:22:24.232 --> 03:22:25.967
STUDENTS DURING WILDFIRES IN

03:22:26.033 --> 03:22:27.301

SHUTDOWNS SO WE ARE TAKING THE

03:22:29.203 --> 03:22:30.638
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE LEARNED FROM

WILDFIRES AND FROM THIS

03:22:32.773 --> 03:22:33.841
PANDEMIC AND WE WILL BE

03:22:33.908 --> 03:22:35.676

03:22:35.743 --> 03:22:38.412
CONTINUITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

03:22:38.479 --> 03:22:39.413

03:22:39.480 --> 03:22:42.850
THAT PLAN. I WILL BE WORKING

03:22:42.917 --> 03:22:44.485
WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER WEBER

FORCE MEMBERS TO CREATE THAT

03:22:51.893 --> 03:22:54.562
PLAN WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN

03:22:54.629 --> 03:22:55.162
HAVE THAT OUT THE BEGINNING OF

03:22:55.229 --> 03:22:58.866

THE THIRD WEEK OF JUNE IS THAT

03:23:05.473 --> 03:23:07.208
WHAT YOU'RE- SAYING IS A TIME

03:23:07.275 --> 03:23:09.510
ONE. I NORMALLY SCHOOL

03:23:09.577 --> 03:23:11.245
DISTRICTS THAT AND THEIR SCHOOL

03:23:11.312 --> 03:23:13.080

MEAN I'M SORRY. BEGINNING IN

03:23:25.126 --> 03:23:30.298
pTHEIR LOOK THE REASON THIS IS

VERY CONCERNING IS AGAIN I KNOW

03:23:33.834 --> 03:23:35.436

BUT AGAIN- THAT CONCERN IS- THE-

03:23:48.449 --> 03:23:51.686
COMPLETE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY

03:23:51.752 --> 03:23:54.989
ACROSS- ACROSS THE STATE AND

03:23:55.056 --> 03:23:57.959
IT'S VERY CONCERNING BECAUSE

03:23:58.025 --> 03:24:01.162
AGAIN- FOR ALL OF THIS COULD

03:24:01.228 --> 03:24:01.762

INTERACTIONS- SO GIVEN THAT I

03:26:14.762 --> 03:26:15.763
WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE FIELD

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:17.465
IS THAT IT'S NOT SET UP A

03:26:17.531 --> 03:26:19.533
SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THE

03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:21.035
INDEPENDENT STUDY SYSTEM. IT'S

03:26:21.102 --> 03:26:24.772

03:26:26.874 --> 03:26:28.909
FIGHT STUDENT WORK REDUCTIONS

03:26:28.976 --> 03:26:31.645
IN DAYS IN SCHOOL I JUST THINK

03:26:31.712 --> 03:26:33.581
GIVEN OUR OUR CIRCUMSTANCES. I

03:26:33.647 --> 03:26:35.249
HEAR FROM EDUCATED EVERY DAY

THEY THEY'RE STRESSED ABOUT THE

03:26:37.318 --> 03:26:38.652
STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE NOT

03:26:38.719 --> 03:26:39.987
BEEN OVER THE CONTACT. THEIR

03:26:40.054 --> 03:26:44.592
ALSO STRESSED ABOUT CONTACT AND-

03:26:44.658 --> 03:26:46.660
HAVING A PRODUCTIVE USE OF TIME

03:26:46.727 --> 03:26:47.695
FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WE ARE IN

03:26:47.762 --> 03:26:52.566
CONTACT WITH. US SO MY- I GUESS

03:26:52.633 --> 03:26:54.502
MY WARNING WOULD BE LET'S NOT

03:26:54.568 --> 03:26:56.737
CREATE ANOTHER SYSTEM WHERE YOU

03:26:56.804 --> 03:26:59.039
HAVE TO WEAR IS UP

03:26:59.106 --> 03:27:02.076
ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT THAT AT

03:27:02.143 --> 03:27:03.577
THIS GOOD THIS IS ARE AFRAID OF

03:27:03.644 --> 03:27:05.479
ACCOUNTABILITY BUT WE'RE WE'RE

REALLY ADJUSTING. AND IT'S

03:27:08.315 --> 03:27:10.184
GONNA BE HARD TO THE DESIGN A

03:27:10.251 --> 03:27:12.486
SYSTEM ON PAPER THAT SAY THIS

03:27:12.553 --> 03:27:16.290
IS WHAT WE CLEARLY. EXPECT NOT

03:27:16.357 --> 03:27:17.358
ONLY FOR THE SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT

03:27:17.424 --> 03:27:18.993

03:27:20.628 --> 03:27:22.530
TIME WITH COMPLETING WORK OR

03:27:22.596 --> 03:27:23.898
TENDING. TO THE OTHER

03:27:23.964 --> 03:27:25.232
OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY HAPPEN TO

03:27:25.299 --> 03:27:26.066

COMPETENT IN THEIR DOES ALL

03:27:37.845 --> 03:27:39.914
THESE QUESTIONS AND I THINK WE

03:27:39.980 --> 03:27:42.349
NEED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF

03:27:42.416 --> 03:27:43.551

ECONOMIC CRISIS FOR MANY OF OUR

03:27:48.823 --> 03:27:50.891
FAMILIES. AND I THINK WE'RE

03:27:50.958 --> 03:27:52.193

LEARN A LOT WHEN THERE IS A

03:28:03.571 --> 03:28:04.171
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

03:28:04.238 --> 03:28:06.240
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE I ALWAYS

03:28:06.307 --> 03:28:07.341

03:31:32.379 --> 03:31:34.281
WE STILL HAVE THE CALIFORNIA

03:31:34.348 --> 03:31:36.150
ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT PROGRESS

03:31:36.216 --> 03:31:37.918
A PERFORMANCE IN PROGRESS SO

03:31:37.985 --> 03:31:41.922
THOSE. THOSE WITH STILL BE IN

03:31:41.989 --> 03:31:45.292
EXISTENCE. ONE OF THE STRUGGLE

03:31:45.359 --> 03:31:45.859
THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT MIGHT

03:31:45.926 --> 03:31:48.962
HAVE IS IF YOU WERE LOCALLY AS

03:31:49.029 --> 03:31:50.764
THINGS DO YOUR OFFICE THAT

03:31:50.831 --> 03:31:53.167
MESSAGE. IS BETTER AND THE

03:31:53.233 --> 03:31:54.601
STANDARDS IN THE- AND OF A

03:31:54.668 --> 03:32:00.974
STUDENT PROGRESS AND. AT THE

03:32:01.041 --> 03:32:02.476
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE AND I

03:32:02.543 --> 03:32:04.611
DISTANCED OF OUR WE'RE WE'RE

03:32:04.678 --> 03:32:05.379
WE'RE STILL HAVEN'T IS A ABOUT

03:32:05.446 --> 03:32:07.081
U. S. STUDENT. I IF YOU'RE A TO

03:32:07.147 --> 03:32:09.583
DO. OR IF YOU HAVE TO CHEN YOUR

03:32:09.650 --> 03:32:11.718
ASSESSMENT MEN. SO ONCE AGAIN

03:32:11.785 --> 03:32:12.920
THE OLDER TWO DIFFERENT

03:32:12.986 --> 03:32:15.589
CONVERSATIONS AND BOTH ARE

03:32:15.656 --> 03:32:17.691
IMPORTANT. BUT I HEAR FROM

03:32:17.758 --> 03:32:19.393
TEACHERS I HAVE A- TREMENDOUS

03:32:19.460 --> 03:32:21.128
RESPECT FOR OUR OUR TEACHERS

03:32:21.195 --> 03:32:23.130
AND THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'M

03:32:23.197 --> 03:32:25.466
HEARING ARE A AS A PERTAINS TO

03:32:25.532 --> 03:32:26.900
THIS YEAR THE NINETEEN TWENTY

03:32:26.967 --> 03:32:27.968
SCHOOL YEAR IS. A WHAT WHAT

03:32:28.035 --> 03:32:29.536
WHAT WERE THOSE ESSENTIAL

03:32:29.603 --> 03:32:33.273
STANDARDS THAT WE INTENDED TO

03:32:33.340 --> 03:32:36.643
TEACH DURING THE LATTER PART OF

03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:41.381
THIS YEAR AND IS IT WAY THAT WE

03:32:41.448 --> 03:32:42.950
CAN. STONE THAT UP ALREADY BEEN

03:32:43.016 --> 03:32:44.818
TAUGHT AND MAYBE IT I GIVE

03:32:44.885 --> 03:32:45.953
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:32:46.019 --> 03:32:47.621
STUDENTS TO LEARN THAT. THAT

03:32:47.688 --> 03:32:49.523
DIDN'T AT. IF THE STUDENT DID

03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:50.624
NOT LEARN THOSE STANDARDS

03:32:50.691 --> 03:32:52.059
DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS

03:32:52.126 --> 03:32:53.494
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. SO THOSE

03:32:53.560 --> 03:32:55.162
ARE THE CONVERSATION THAT I

03:32:55.229 --> 03:32:56.663
HEAR TEACHERS HAVE BEEN RIGHT

03:32:56.730 --> 03:32:58.365
NOW THERE'S AN EXTREME INTEREST

03:32:58.432 --> 03:33:00.734
IN. MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS

03:33:00.801 --> 03:33:03.370
ARE LEARNING RELEASED EXPOSED

03:33:03.437 --> 03:33:04.605
TO AT THE VERY LEAST TO THE

03:33:04.671 --> 03:33:05.572
STANDARDS THAT THEY WERE

03:33:05.639 --> 03:33:07.407
SUPPOSED TO BE EXPOSED TO. THE

03:33:07.474 --> 03:33:08.642
PARTICULAR YEAR THAT THEY'RE IN

03:33:08.709 --> 03:33:10.711
SCHOOL. SO ONCE AGAIN-

03:33:10.777 --> 03:33:13.147
DIFFERENT THE ACCOUNTABILITY I

03:33:13.213 --> 03:33:14.515
JUST I DON'T WANT TO DEVELOP A

03:33:14.581 --> 03:33:16.383
WHOLE DIFFERENT. WAY OF A

03:33:16.450 --> 03:33:18.819
COUNTY FOR UNITS BEING THERE IN

03:33:18.886 --> 03:33:20.654
THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC

03:33:20.721 --> 03:33:22.523
BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S GONNA BE A

03:33:22.589 --> 03:33:26.460
DISJOINTED. CATION LEAVE WELL

03:33:26.527 --> 03:33:27.861
HE DID IT COMMON THIS GOAL DAYS

03:33:27.928 --> 03:33:30.230
A WEEK. AND A YOU KNOW IT OR IF

03:33:30.297 --> 03:33:32.399
THEY DO THEY WON'T BE THERE

03:33:32.466 --> 03:33:33.901
DURING THE THIS FIVE OR SIX

03:33:33.967 --> 03:33:35.068
HOURS THAT THEY THEY ARGUE

03:33:35.135 --> 03:33:37.037
EVERY SCHOOL DAY. THAT WAS MY

03:33:37.104 --> 03:33:39.039
MAIN POINT IN IN.

03:33:39.106 --> 03:33:40.274
RECOMMENDATIONS GOT A GUN THAT

03:33:40.340 --> 03:33:41.475
AND THAT'S A POINT WELL TAKEN

03:33:41.542 --> 03:33:42.843
BUT JUST GOING BACK TO MY

03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:45.479
QUESTION SO. HOW HOW DO YOU

03:33:45.546 --> 03:33:50.317
ENSURE CONSISTENCY. ACROSS TWO

03:33:50.384 --> 03:33:50.851
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN YOUR

03:33:50.918 --> 03:33:52.219
DISTRICT. YET TYPICALLY WHAT

03:33:52.286 --> 03:33:53.253
HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE A

03:33:53.320 --> 03:33:54.688
CURRICULUM GUIDE AND WE HAVE A

03:33:54.755 --> 03:33:56.290
CURRICULUM GUIDE IN IN THE

03:33:56.356 --> 03:33:58.425
TEACHERS ARE MEETING- MULTIPLE

03:33:58.492 --> 03:34:01.228
YEARS- HAND THERE. THEY HAVE AN

03:34:01.295 --> 03:34:02.496
AGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER THOSE

03:34:02.563 --> 03:34:04.097
STANDARDS THAT ARE TAUGHT

03:34:04.164 --> 03:34:05.499
THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR

03:34:05.566 --> 03:34:07.367
BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIRE TO

03:34:07.434 --> 03:34:08.135
DEVELOP PROFESSIONAL LEARNING

03:34:08.202 --> 03:34:10.504
COMMUNITIES MANY SCHOOLS AND

03:34:10.571 --> 03:34:12.472
DISTRICTS HAVE A SCOPE IN A

03:34:12.539 --> 03:34:14.341
SEQUENCE. THAT'S ATTACHED TO

03:34:14.408 --> 03:34:17.411
THOSE STANDARDS SO THINK WHAT

03:34:17.477 --> 03:34:18.212
THE WHICH WE'RE GONNA TEACH A

03:34:18.278 --> 03:34:22.449
PARTICULAR IS ENTERED AND- SIX

03:34:22.516 --> 03:34:23.917
SIX TO NINE WEEKS TEACHERS IN

03:34:23.984 --> 03:34:24.685
THE SAME GREAT LEVEL OR

03:34:24.751 --> 03:34:26.253
TEACHING THE SAME SUBJECT AREA

03:34:26.320 --> 03:34:28.922
CAN COLLABORATE. THIS TO LOOK

03:34:28.989 --> 03:34:31.024
AT STUDENT ASSESSMENT DATA AND

03:34:31.091 --> 03:34:33.360
GET IT. BERMAN WHAT IT STUDENTS

03:34:33.427 --> 03:34:35.162
LEARN AND WHAT DO WE STILL NEED

03:34:35.229 --> 03:34:37.431
TO REVISIT AT SCHOOL OR AS A

03:34:37.497 --> 03:34:39.533
GRADE LEVEL TEAM. AND THOSE

03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:42.669
SYSTEMS. I THINK THE QUESTION

03:34:42.736 --> 03:34:44.871
BE TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THOSE

03:34:44.938 --> 03:34:47.541
SYSTEM STILL IN PLACE I KNOW. I

03:34:47.608 --> 03:34:48.775
KNOW WE HAD SEVERAL

03:34:48.842 --> 03:34:50.844
CONVERSATIONS AGAIN WITH OUR

03:34:50.911 --> 03:34:52.779
OUR TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ABOUT

03:34:52.846 --> 03:34:54.681
WHAT WILL BE THE DIFFERENT WORK

03:34:54.748 --> 03:34:56.984
EXPECTATIONS WITH THIS. AND

03:34:57.050 --> 03:34:58.218
PART OF THAT DISTANCE LEARNING

03:34:58.285 --> 03:35:00.220
PLAN THAT WE DEVELOP ONCE AGAIN

03:35:00.287 --> 03:35:02.155
I SAY WE DEVELOPED BUT THERE'S

03:35:02.222 --> 03:35:03.757
A TREMENDOUS NETWORK OF

03:35:03.824 --> 03:35:05.926
EDUCATOR THAT ASSURING FORCES I

03:35:05.993 --> 03:35:08.395
SAY WE- BORROWED. LOOKED AT

03:35:08.462 --> 03:35:09.963
THEIR FRAMES FROM A NUMBER OF

03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:11.865
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND DECIDED

03:35:11.932 --> 03:35:12.833
WHAT WILL WORK IN OUR SCHOOL

03:35:12.899 --> 03:35:14.268
DISTRICT BUT EVEN THOUGH I

03:35:14.334 --> 03:35:17.204
THINK THAT THAT THAT TOOK A FEW

03:35:17.271 --> 03:35:19.906
WEEKS THAT SIT DOWN WITH. OUR

03:35:19.973 --> 03:35:20.674
TEACHERS UNION THAT SAY WHAT

03:35:20.741 --> 03:35:23.577
ARE THE EXPECTATIONS SO AND-

03:35:23.644 --> 03:35:24.611
THE WITHIN THAT I MENTIONED THE

03:35:24.678 --> 03:35:25.612
STUDENT LEARNING PART BUT THE

03:35:25.679 --> 03:35:27.981
TEACHER LEARNING AS A RESULT OF

03:35:28.048 --> 03:35:29.383
STUDENT LEARNING. IN OTHER

03:35:29.449 --> 03:35:30.484
WORDS USING THE RESULTS OF

03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:31.952
ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE YOUR

03:35:32.019 --> 03:35:33.353
NEXT STEP DOWN AS THE AT THE

03:35:33.420 --> 03:35:34.488
TEACHER. THAT'S BEEN PART OF

03:35:34.554 --> 03:35:36.189
OUR CONVERSATION WITH THEM THAT

03:35:36.256 --> 03:35:37.891
WE HAVE TO SAY ALL CAME. WE

03:35:37.958 --> 03:35:39.626
USED TO HAVE A WYNNSTAY

03:35:39.693 --> 03:35:40.961
COLLABORATION TIME FOR

03:35:41.028 --> 03:35:42.362
TEACHERS. WEDNESDAY

03:35:42.429 --> 03:35:43.897
COLLABORATION TO ACT WHAT'S

03:35:43.964 --> 03:35:45.232
THAT LOOK LIKE NOW IS THAT

03:35:45.299 --> 03:35:48.001
STILL EXPRESS THEIR KERR. OUT I

03:35:48.068 --> 03:35:51.271
DIDN'T EXPECT TO OCCUR. WE

03:35:51.338 --> 03:35:53.640
TYPICALLY IT WOULD HAPPEN IN

03:35:53.707 --> 03:35:56.343
MANY CASES THEY WILL YOUR TO

03:35:56.410 --> 03:35:57.411
COME UP. WHAT WOULD BE THE END

03:35:57.477 --> 03:35:59.012
AND- THOSE FACT. WHEN ARE THE

03:35:59.079 --> 03:36:08.121
GREAT TEAMS CONTAIN TO MEET.

03:36:08.188 --> 03:36:10.857
AND TRANSFERRED INTO THIS NEW

03:36:10.924 --> 03:36:12.626
SYSTEM THAT WE'RE APPROACHING

03:36:12.693 --> 03:36:14.094
FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

03:36:14.161 --> 03:36:15.562
SCHOOL YEAR BUT SOME OF IT'S

03:36:15.629 --> 03:36:16.463
REALLY JUST DECIDING

03:36:16.530 --> 03:36:17.964
LOGISTICALLY WHAT WILL WORK

03:36:18.031 --> 03:36:19.399
WITHIN OUR PARTICULAR

03:36:19.466 --> 03:36:22.502
ORGANIZATION I MIX AND- MENTION

03:36:22.569 --> 03:36:23.737
THE WINDS THAT COLLABORATION.

03:36:23.804 --> 03:36:25.138
DISTRICTS THOSE OPPORTUNITY DO

03:36:25.205 --> 03:36:27.541
SOME DON'T SO THOSE SAME

03:36:27.607 --> 03:36:28.775
SYSTEMS THAT WERE IN PLACE

03:36:28.842 --> 03:36:30.544
BEFORE SOME OF THOSE WILL BE

03:36:30.610 --> 03:36:33.714
JUST- ADJUSTED TO IT INTO OUR

03:36:33.780 --> 03:36:36.283
NEW NORM. SO I'LL JUST AS YOU

03:36:36.350 --> 03:36:37.351
LAST QUESTION THAT I KNOW WE

03:36:37.417 --> 03:36:39.052
GOT TO MOVE ON TO SOME OF THE

03:36:39.119 --> 03:36:40.854
OTHER. MY OTHER COLLEAGUES

03:36:40.921 --> 03:36:41.822
READING OF CHANCE TO HAVE SOME

03:36:41.888 --> 03:36:45.192
OF THE OTHER FOLKS QUESTIONS.

03:36:45.258 --> 03:36:53.500
I'M THEN YOU. SO AS AS YOU'RE

03:36:53.567 --> 03:36:55.769
DEVELOPING THIS- WITH YOUR

03:36:55.836 --> 03:36:58.605
TEACHERS LET'S HAVE THE

03:36:58.672 --> 03:37:01.274
ASSUMPTION ON HOW THE TEACHERS

03:37:01.341 --> 03:37:03.877
WEREN'T ABLE TO GET- GIVE THE

03:37:03.944 --> 03:37:05.278
KIND OF INSTRUCTION THEY WANTED

03:37:05.345 --> 03:37:06.646
TO THE LAST ONE THIRD OF THE

03:37:06.713 --> 03:37:08.882
SCHOOL YEAR WHAT PLANS DO YOU

03:37:08.949 --> 03:37:11.585
HAVE INTO THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR

03:37:11.651 --> 03:37:15.389
IN TERMS OF CATCHING A LOT.

03:37:15.455 --> 03:37:16.790
THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

03:37:16.857 --> 03:37:18.425
QUESTION FOR OUR PARTICULAR

03:37:18.492 --> 03:37:20.394
SYSTEM ONCE AGAIN WE JUST

03:37:20.460 --> 03:37:21.695
SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF

03:37:21.762 --> 03:37:23.063
UNDERSTANDING- MO YOU WITH

03:37:23.130 --> 03:37:26.133
THERE ARE TEACHERS ABOUT SEVEN

03:37:26.199 --> 03:37:27.434
EIGHT EIGHT DAYS AGO. SO WE'RE

03:37:27.501 --> 03:37:28.835
WE'RE REALLY WELL DONE GETTING

03:37:28.902 --> 03:37:30.504
THE END OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR

03:37:30.570 --> 03:37:32.172
WE'RE HAVING CONGRESS ABOUT.

03:37:32.239 --> 03:37:33.940
THE COLLECTION OF MATERIALS AT

03:37:34.007 --> 03:37:35.375
THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WE

03:37:35.442 --> 03:37:36.209
HAVE A CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

03:37:36.276 --> 03:37:38.478
GRADUATION THAT PROMOTION-

03:37:38.545 --> 03:37:40.080
WHERE TESTING WHAT OUR SUMMER

03:37:40.147 --> 03:37:42.816
SCHOOL MAY LOOK LIKE- I THINK

03:37:42.883 --> 03:37:43.917
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER WHEN

03:37:43.984 --> 03:37:46.887
I'M STARTING TO HEAR FROM THE

03:37:46.953 --> 03:37:48.188
FIELD IS THAT ARE ACCOMPLISHED.

03:37:48.255 --> 03:37:50.524
ABOUT YOU YOU HEARD EARLIER

03:37:50.590 --> 03:37:52.058
ASSESSING STUDENTS. AS WE WERE

03:37:52.125 --> 03:37:53.994
TO SCHOOL. AND TO SEE WHERE

03:37:54.060 --> 03:37:55.996
THERE MIGHT BE LEARNING GAPS.

03:37:56.062 --> 03:37:57.697
OUT SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE THE

03:37:57.764 --> 03:38:00.167
EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY IS JUST

03:38:00.233 --> 03:38:00.867
THE BOBBING INTO THAT.

03:38:00.934 --> 03:38:03.203
CONVERSATION RECOGNIZING. THAT

03:38:03.270 --> 03:38:04.671
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING NEXT

03:38:04.738 --> 03:38:06.373
YEAR BUT I CAN SAY. WHAT'S THE

03:38:06.440 --> 03:38:08.642
DATE WAS MARCH STEP EITHER

03:38:08.708 --> 03:38:09.176
SIXTEEN WHERE MANY OF THE

03:38:09.242 --> 03:38:11.445
SCHOOL STARTED. CLOSING THE IN

03:38:11.511 --> 03:38:12.679
SCHOOL INSTRUCTION WE'VE COME A

03:38:12.746 --> 03:38:15.582
LONG WAY IN A VERY SHORT TIME.

03:38:15.649 --> 03:38:17.350
AND I KNOW THERE ARE COMMERCE

03:38:17.417 --> 03:38:18.585
ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO

03:38:18.652 --> 03:38:20.854
MITIGATE THE LEARNING LOSS. AND

03:38:20.921 --> 03:38:22.189
IT LEAVES THOSE CONVERSATIONS

03:38:22.255 --> 03:38:23.957
THOUGH IT ONLY WE ARE WE'RE

03:38:24.024 --> 03:38:24.658
ALWAYS INVOLVED IN THOSE

03:38:24.724 --> 03:38:27.260
CONVERSATIONS. AND SOME WHERE

03:38:27.327 --> 03:38:28.795
EVERYBODY GETS SAYING WE COULD

03:38:28.862 --> 03:38:30.363
DO BETTER AND I THINK WE COULD

03:38:30.430 --> 03:38:31.798
DO BETTER AND I SAY WE TOTAL

03:38:31.865 --> 03:38:35.936
SCHOOL SYSTEM. EVERYTHING

03:38:36.002 --> 03:38:37.003
IMPACTS THEIR BEING RIGHT.

03:38:37.070 --> 03:38:38.405
AFTER OUR PARTICULAR. WE

03:38:38.472 --> 03:38:40.907
ALREADY TASK CUTTING CERTAIN

03:38:40.974 --> 03:38:42.676

03:41:23.837 --> 03:41:26.172
I'VE I'VE NOT HEARD- THERE

03:41:26.239 --> 03:41:27.173
THERE SHOULD BE SOME

03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:29.376
CONSIDERATION ON- WHAT THE

03:41:29.442 --> 03:41:31.911
CONSISTENCY- MIGHT NEED TO BE

03:41:31.978 --> 03:41:35.148
ADD THE LONGER WE GO INTO THIS-

03:41:35.215 --> 03:41:36.316
THE OTHER PIECE I WANTED TO

03:41:36.383 --> 03:41:38.618
ECHO WAS AT RELATED TO

03:41:38.685 --> 03:41:40.720
GEOGRAPHY. I STARTED IN THIS

03:41:40.787 --> 03:41:42.522
HEARING TALKING ABOUT HOW

03:41:42.589 --> 03:41:44.324
IMPORTANT IT'S GOING TO BE FOR

03:41:44.391 --> 03:41:46.426
SCHOOLS TO OPEN UP TO BE PART

03:41:46.493 --> 03:41:47.761
OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY- AND

03:41:47.827 --> 03:41:49.829
HAVING SAID THAT RECOGNIZE THAT

03:41:49.896 --> 03:41:52.198
NOT ALL COMMUNITIES ARE THE

03:41:52.265 --> 03:41:53.967
SAME RIGHT NOW WHEN I THINK OF

03:41:54.034 --> 03:41:56.002
LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND HAVING

03:41:56.069 --> 03:41:57.637
NOT ONLY THE LARGEST SCHOOL

03:41:57.704 --> 03:41:59.339
DISTRICT IN OUR STATE BUT ALSO

03:41:59.406 --> 03:42:01.174
HAVING KOBE CASES THAT ARE

03:42:01.241 --> 03:42:04.678
GOING UP- AND STILL SEEN A

03:42:04.744 --> 03:42:06.746
NUMBER OF REALLY DIFFICULT

03:42:06.813 --> 03:42:08.648
HEALTH SITUATE IN A LOS ANGELES

03:42:08.715 --> 03:42:11.818
COUNTY I CAN'T IMAGINE- THAT. A

03:42:11.885 --> 03:42:14.654
COUNTY- LIKE LOS ANGELES COUNTY

03:42:14.721 --> 03:42:16.389
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME

03:42:16.456 --> 03:42:19.159
THING AS A DIFFERENT COUNTY AND

03:42:19.225 --> 03:42:20.827
I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE-

03:42:20.894 --> 03:42:22.862
ACCEPTANCE FOR AND THE IDEA

03:42:22.929 --> 03:42:24.764
THAT. COUNTIES MIGHT BE IN AND

03:42:24.831 --> 03:42:26.633
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION AND

03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:28.468
I WANT US TO LOOK AT THE

03:42:28.535 --> 03:42:31.271
DIFFERENCES IN AUGUST AND SEE

03:42:31.337 --> 03:42:35.642
WHAT WE ARE AND ABLE TO YOU.

03:42:35.709 --> 03:42:39.713

03:42:39.779 --> 03:42:43.049
OUTCOME IN THE LONG TERM OUR

03:42:43.116 --> 03:42:44.884
STUDENTS I EIGHT MEANS WE'RE

03:42:44.951 --> 03:42:46.486
GOING TO HAVE TO IT SOMEWHAT TO

03:42:46.553 --> 03:42:48.021
ADDITIONALLY I ACT THAT THE-

03:42:48.088 --> 03:42:55.328
REAL TO SO BILLS IT WOULD VERY.

03:42:55.395 --> 03:42:56.529
TO KNOW HOW THE SCHOOL

03:42:56.596 --> 03:42:57.297
DISTRICTS PARTICIPATING ARE NOT

03:42:57.363 --> 03:42:58.398
FULLY PART. I KNOW AND SOME OF

03:42:58.465 --> 03:43:00.600
DISTRICTS. READ THAT

03:43:00.667 --> 03:43:02.502
PARTICIPATE. BUT THE SAME.

03:43:02.569 --> 03:43:04.971
FAMILIES THAT ARE. A SENSE

03:43:05.038 --> 03:43:07.373
WORKER THIS FOR THAT WERE

03:43:07.440 --> 03:43:08.041
ALREADY LIVING ON THE ACT. MORE%

03:43:08.108 --> 03:43:08.641
ARE THE SAME ONES THAT ARE

03:43:08.708 --> 03:43:10.477

03:43:10.543 --> 03:43:13.513
THEIR CHILDREN AND STUDENTS TO

03:43:13.580 --> 03:43:16.116
SOME OF THIS FEEDING KIDS HAS

03:43:16.182 --> 03:43:19.519
NEVER BEEN SO DIFFICULT- IT IS

03:43:19.586 --> 03:43:21.221
A VERY BIG CHALLENGE IN A AND I

03:43:21.287 --> 03:43:22.722
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

03:43:22.789 --> 03:43:24.991
KNOW. AND THIS RELATES NOT JUST

03:43:25.058 --> 03:43:25.992
TO THEIR LEARNING BUT ALSO

03:43:26.059 --> 03:43:28.962
RELATES TO THEIR HEALTH. AND SO

03:43:29.028 --> 03:43:30.063
I THINK THAT THAT'S AN

03:43:30.130 --> 03:43:33.166
IMPORTANT PIECE UP I WANT TO

03:43:33.233 --> 03:43:35.502

GOVERNOR OR JUST A GENERAL TASK

03:43:44.010 --> 03:43:46.379
FORCE I'M NOT CLEAR ABOUT THEIR

03:43:46.446 --> 03:43:48.848
TIME LINES I THINK I NOW KNOW.

03:43:48.915 --> 03:43:51.184
WHAT TO OUTCOMES THEY WERE UP

03:43:51.251 --> 03:43:55.355

RESULTS THAT WE GET OVERNIGHT

03:44:22.315 --> 03:44:24.417
BUT CERTAINLY THERE IS A SENSE

03:44:24.484 --> 03:44:26.519
OF URGENCY AND ALL OF THIS AND

03:44:26.586 --> 03:44:27.987
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY

03:44:28.054 --> 03:44:29.856
IMPORTANT FOR THOSE FIRST TO

03:44:29.923 --> 03:44:31.291

OR WON'T DO AND NOW MIGHT BE

03:44:44.137 --> 03:44:46.339
QUESTION FOLLOWING WHEN I DID

THE TIME OF THIS. IS AT THIS

03:44:53.580 --> 03:44:54.113
PARTICULAR PANEL IT WAS ABOUT

03:44:54.180 --> 03:44:56.449
LEARNING WE- HAVE A WAY TO.

03:44:56.516 --> 03:44:57.217
LEARN DID YOU OR DID YOU KNOW

03:44:57.283 --> 03:44:59.853
LEARN SOMETHING FOR STUDENTS-

03:44:59.919 --> 03:45:01.254
AND THAT WASTE TYPICALLY I AM

03:45:01.321 --> 03:45:04.090
VERY MUCH MODELS FOR A SCHOOL

03:45:04.157 --> 03:45:05.625
PROGRAM WHERE YOU SEE KIDS IN

03:45:05.692 --> 03:45:08.595
PERSON. BUT THIS IS ABOUT LOS.

03:45:08.661 --> 03:45:11.297
HOW ARE WE MEASURING LEARNING

KNOW WHAT STUDENTS ARE LOSING

03:45:18.238 --> 03:45:20.940
AND ALL OF THIS AND- THAT I

03:45:21.007 --> 03:45:23.176
HOPE WILL INFLUENCE HOW WE

03:45:23.243 --> 03:45:25.778
THINK. ABOUT AND THAT SOME OF

03:45:25.845 --> 03:45:28.181
THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WHAT

03:45:28.248 --> 03:45:29.182
ARE THE METRICS THAT ARE BEING

03:45:29.249 --> 03:45:31.050
USED WHEN WILL WE HAVE

03:45:31.117 --> 03:45:33.353

THIS HEATHER HAVE ALL DON'T BET

03:46:11.858 --> 03:46:14.527
ON THAT I THINK THAT THERE IS

03:46:14.594 --> 03:46:16.696
NO WAIT THINK ABOUT HOW WE

03:46:16.763 --> 03:46:19.365
MEASURE A LOT AND ONE IN THE

03:46:19.432 --> 03:46:23.670
WAY THEY YOU ACT WHICH IS WHY.

03:46:23.736 --> 03:46:30.109

AND LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY I

03:46:42.488 --> 03:46:44.724
IT'S MORE HELPFUL FOR THE

03:46:44.791 --> 03:46:48.294
SYSTEM BUT ALL FOR A- WHO YOU

03:46:48.361 --> 03:46:49.762

DARLING HAMMOND AND FOR THE CD.

03:50:03.890 --> 03:50:05.958
IS OUR BELIEF THAT THE SAME

03:50:06.025 --> 03:50:08.194
TOOLS WE WERE USING TO MEASURE

03:50:08.261 --> 03:50:10.229
STUDENT LEARNING BEFORE COVERT

03:50:10.296 --> 03:50:13.332
NINETEEN. SHOULD BE IN PLACE.

03:50:13.399 --> 03:50:15.835
POST COVERT NINETEEN OR ARE

03:50:15.902 --> 03:50:19.805
THOSE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE.

03:50:19.872 --> 03:50:22.775
OUR STANDARDS HAVE NOT CHANGED.

03:50:22.842 --> 03:50:26.646
RIGHT SO THAT'S MENTAL'S SO I

03:50:26.712 --> 03:50:28.314
THAT RIGHT STANDARD HAVEN'T BUT

03:50:28.381 --> 03:50:30.183
THE A TOOLS BECAUSE NOT MEASURE

03:50:30.249 --> 03:50:31.484
LEARN WERE ALSO MEASURING

03:50:31.551 --> 03:50:33.419
LEARNING LOS NOW AT LEAST

03:50:33.486 --> 03:50:36.856
THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTAND THAT'S

03:50:36.923 --> 03:50:38.658
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO KNOW.

03:50:38.724 --> 03:50:39.926
THE ASSESSMENT TOOLS CAN'T

03:50:39.992 --> 03:50:42.962
STILL YOU. WE WOULD ACTUALLY

03:50:43.029 --> 03:50:45.665
WORK ON AND I BELIEVE. LINK

03:50:45.731 --> 03:50:47.066
THAT STARTING ALREADY SPENT TO

03:50:47.133 --> 03:50:50.570
THE RUN TO TIE. AND STUFF HE-

03:50:50.636 --> 03:50:54.240
TO HELP FURTHER INTO. I FOR OUR-

03:50:54.307 --> 03:50:56.142
FIRST AND SO GRADE. WHERE THERE

03:50:56.209 --> 03:51:00.279
LEARNING AS TO BEEN OUR READ.

03:51:00.346 --> 03:51:01.080
AND BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A

03:51:01.147 --> 03:51:03.382
REALLY A- DYING. AND

03:51:03.449 --> 03:51:04.050
INFORMATION TO HAVE FOR

03:51:04.116 --> 03:51:06.319
TEACHERS OF WHAT GAPS ARE THERE

03:51:06.385 --> 03:51:12.191
AND THERE READINGS. DO YOU KNOW

03:51:12.258 --> 03:51:14.227
THE TIME AWAY AND TRY WITH THE

03:51:14.293 --> 03:51:15.828
DISTANCE LEARNING RIGHT AND

03:51:15.895 --> 03:51:19.599
JUST I TO THE QUESTION LEARNING

03:51:19.665 --> 03:51:20.666
WHEN PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT ABOUT

03:51:20.733 --> 03:51:24.337
THAT IN THE- RICHER. THERE CHOI

03:51:24.403 --> 03:51:26.639
ABOUT WHERE STUDENTS ARE IN

03:51:26.706 --> 03:51:29.208
AGGREGATEDANALYSIS. HE'S A BIT

WORK IT IN. YEAR AS WE OF X.

03:51:34.046 --> 03:51:36.349
THEM TO BE ANOTHER WAS THEY FOR

03:51:36.415 --> 03:51:38.517
EXAMPLE LOOKS. IN SORT OF A

03:51:38.584 --> 03:51:39.819
YEAR WORTH OF GROW OVER THE

03:51:39.885 --> 03:51:42.221
COURSE OF THE YEAR BUT WITH

03:51:42.288 --> 03:51:44.357
THESE. OF WITH THE THAT WERE

03:51:44.423 --> 03:51:46.325
TALK ABOUT YOU CAN OF SEE WORST

03:51:46.392 --> 03:51:48.294
WERE AND DISTRICT DO THIS

03:51:48.361 --> 03:51:50.062
REGULAR. WHERE WERE STUDENTS

03:51:50.129 --> 03:51:52.732
STAND. OF TWO TWO AND WHERE ARE

03:51:52.798 --> 03:51:56.002
IN. YOU KNOW JIM WHERE ARE THEY-

03:51:56.068 --> 03:51:58.804
SO. I YOU CAN PROGRESS

03:51:58.871 --> 03:52:00.506
INDIVIDUALS WHEN YOU'RE USING

03:52:00.573 --> 03:52:03.542
THESE KINDS OF DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS

03:52:03.609 --> 03:52:06.846
I'M SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO KNOW.

03:52:06.912 --> 03:52:13.452
STUDENTS ACT. GET DUMBER.

03:52:13.519 --> 03:52:17.189
LEARNING WAS REAL BIG CONTINUE

03:52:17.256 --> 03:52:21.994
LEARN BUT THEY CAN LOOK. UP

03:52:22.061 --> 03:52:24.897
FACILITY AT A FULL ONCE IN SOME

03:52:24.964 --> 03:52:29.402
SO AND YOU WEIGH YOUR TO. LIKE

03:52:29.468 --> 03:52:32.738
NAS ASSESSMENTS OR TIME BUT

03:52:32.805 --> 03:52:35.274
STILL ARE WAYS TO DO THE TWO

03:52:35.341 --> 03:52:39.478
NOT. IS A MANAGED WITH LARGE

03:52:39.545 --> 03:52:43.883
SCALE SOME TELL THAT ARE NOT.

03:52:43.949 --> 03:52:45.885
CHEERED AND TRACK TO SEE.

03:52:45.951 --> 03:52:49.622
SKILLS THE YOU AND- I GUESS IT

03:52:49.689 --> 03:52:51.590
I'M THINKING IF I'M A PARENT

03:52:51.657 --> 03:52:52.892
AND I'M TO MAKE IT TO. AND THIS

03:52:52.958 --> 03:52:55.294
IS GOES ON FOR WEAR DO YOU KNOW

03:52:55.361 --> 03:52:56.929
EACH IS THIS IS AT HOME WE STE

03:52:56.996 --> 03:52:58.164
MOVING THE MODEL THAT A LOT OF

03:52:58.230 --> 03:52:59.131
YOU HAVE TO WHICH IS A OF

03:52:59.198 --> 03:53:01.467
BLENDER LEARNING A SATURDAY A.

03:53:01.534 --> 03:53:04.136
M. P. BLOCKS. HOLIDAY SHIPS ALL

03:53:04.203 --> 03:53:07.239
THAT GOOD STUFF AT WHAT POINT

03:53:07.306 --> 03:53:10.376
DO I HAVE SOME INFORMATION TO

03:53:10.443 --> 03:53:13.346
HELP ME DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT

03:53:13.412 --> 03:53:15.648
WHAT THAT CHILD HAS OR HAS NOT

03:53:15.715 --> 03:53:17.883
LEARNED SHOULD BE SOMETHING

03:53:17.950 --> 03:53:20.286
THAT THE CHILD HOULD- SHOULD

03:53:20.353 --> 03:53:22.021
THAT A PARENT AND A TEACHER

03:53:22.088 --> 03:53:23.122
SHOULD CONSIDER ON WHETHER THE

03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:24.990
CHILD MOVES FORWARD. I THINK

03:53:25.057 --> 03:53:29.829
YOU MISSED IT YOU KNOW TANG

03:53:29.895 --> 03:53:32.365
MENTIONED IT JUST DO WE READ

03:53:32.431 --> 03:53:36.769
SURE FREE I MEAN. THAT'S A

03:53:36.836 --> 03:53:38.637
COMMENT THAT IS IT YOU KNOW.

03:53:38.704 --> 03:53:41.841
I'M SURE. YOU KNOW. HOW SERIOUS

03:53:41.907 --> 03:53:42.808
HE WAS BUT AT SOME POINT WE DO

03:53:42.875 --> 03:53:43.976
ACT HAVE TO CAN THAT AT WHAT

03:53:44.043 --> 03:53:45.978
POINT DO WE HAVE ENOUGH

03:53:46.045 --> 03:53:47.713
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT STUDENTS

03:53:47.780 --> 03:53:50.116
ARE OR ARE NOT LEARNING TO HELP

03:53:50.182 --> 03:53:51.650
US DETERMINE WHETHER AN

03:53:51.717 --> 03:53:55.454
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT OR YOU KNOW

03:53:55.521 --> 03:53:57.056
A GROUP OF STUDENTS ARE GOING

03:53:57.123 --> 03:53:59.425
TO HAVE TO REPEAT A YEAR

03:53:59.492 --> 03:54:00.726
BECAUSE THE LEARNING WASN'T

03:54:00.793 --> 03:54:02.962
SUCH BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT'S

03:54:03.028 --> 03:54:04.230
NOT JUST ABOUT MISSING ONE OR

03:54:04.296 --> 03:54:05.664
TWO STANDARDS. AND I DON'T

03:54:05.731 --> 03:54:07.566
BELIEVE THAT THE STATE HAS EVER

03:54:07.633 --> 03:54:09.101
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT I

03:54:09.168 --> 03:54:11.036
COULD BE WRONG I MEAN I CAN I

03:54:11.103 --> 03:54:13.172
WAS IN A DISTRICT THAT HAD WILD

03:54:13.239 --> 03:54:15.241
FIRES AND DEBRIS FLOWS AND

03:54:15.307 --> 03:54:17.376
CERTAINLY SHUT DOWN MUCH LONG

03:54:17.443 --> 03:54:18.911
BUT THIS IS. WHAT WE WENT

03:54:18.978 --> 03:54:20.146
THROUGH THEN IT'S NOTHING LIKE

03:54:20.212 --> 03:54:25.651
WHAT HAPPENING NOW- AND AT

03:54:25.718 --> 03:54:26.285
EIGHT AND THEN YOU KNOW PERHAPS

03:54:26.352 --> 03:54:28.154
WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS BUT

03:54:28.220 --> 03:54:30.423
IT'S CERTAINLY THAT'S ON OUR MY-

03:54:30.489 --> 03:54:35.227
I'M FIGHT EVERY. VERY GOOD

03:54:35.294 --> 03:54:38.030
EFFORTS. AT BEEN MADE YOU KNOW

03:54:38.097 --> 03:54:40.099
BY. I TEACHERS IN PARENTS I TO

03:54:40.166 --> 03:54:43.369
THIS. MY FOR THIS TO AND THEIR

03:54:43.436 --> 03:54:44.170
YOU KNOW INTO THE ASSN TO LOG

03:54:44.236 --> 03:54:46.172
ON AT SOME POINT. NOW EVERY

03:54:46.238 --> 03:54:47.306
STUDENT ISN'T A AND WHEN DO WE

03:54:47.373 --> 03:54:48.707
FACE THAT OUT AND DO WE DECIDE.

03:54:48.774 --> 03:54:50.042
WHAT KINDS OF DECISIONS ARE

03:54:50.109 --> 03:54:53.446
MADE FOR FUTURE YEARS. WELL I

03:54:53.512 --> 03:54:54.046
JUST LIKE TO OFFER A COUPLE OF

03:54:54.113 --> 03:54:55.147
COMMENTS AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY

03:54:55.214 --> 03:54:57.850
I HAVE TO. LEAVE BECAUSE I'M

03:54:57.917 --> 03:54:59.418
MISSING ANOTHER MEETING THAT I

03:54:59.485 --> 03:55:02.321
CAN'T RESCHEDULE. FIRST THERE

03:55:02.388 --> 03:55:04.223
WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT LARGE

03:55:04.290 --> 03:55:06.492
SCALE GRADE RETENTION HAS BEEN

03:55:06.559 --> 03:55:07.993
DONE IT HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED

03:55:08.060 --> 03:55:09.628
AND STUDIED OVER THE COURSE OF

03:55:09.695 --> 03:55:11.530
THE LAST FORTY YEARS THERE ARE.

03:55:11.597 --> 03:55:17.069
HUNDREDS OF STUDIES ON THAT AND

03:55:17.136 --> 03:55:19.238
ONLY NOT TO WORK IN TERMS OF

03:55:19.305 --> 03:55:22.174
ACHIEVEMENT GAINS. BUT ALSO TO

03:55:22.241 --> 03:55:24.376
CREATE A HIGHER RATES OF

03:55:24.443 --> 03:55:27.680
ACHIEVEMENT LOS AND- DROP OUT

03:55:27.746 --> 03:55:30.583
SO WE WILL NOT BE RECOMMENDING

03:55:30.649 --> 03:55:31.984
THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE RED SHIRT

03:55:32.051 --> 03:55:34.487
KIDS FOR AN ENTIRE. YEAH SYSTEM

03:55:34.553 --> 03:55:37.056
OVER ENTIRE YEAR- THERE ARE A

03:55:37.122 --> 03:55:39.225
LOT OF STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE

03:55:39.291 --> 03:55:40.693
USED TO ACCELERATE LEARNING AND

03:55:40.759 --> 03:55:42.695
THEY DO RELY IN PART ON KNOWING
