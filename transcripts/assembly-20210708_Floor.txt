MR CAME A OPEN I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AB ONE SIXTY ONE MAKE SOME CLARIFICATIONS TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. FIRST TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BUDGET PACKAGE INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF TOTAL FUNDS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST RESILIENCY THAT'S AVAILABLE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. VOIGTS COUNTIES TWENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION FOR THE RECALL ELECTION IS ESTIMATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. IT ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONAL LNGUAGE FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN CONSERVANCY FUNDING. TO CLARIFY THE USE IN A COMPASS PERMITS FOR THE FUNDS. AND THEN LASTLY CRUX OF BRIDIE OF DRAFTING ERRORS THAT WERE MADE IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT I WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. ON AB ONE SIXTY ONE. THANK YOU MR CHANG MR FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. A MEMBERS THIS IS OUR THIRD BUDGET BILL IN FOUR WEEKS. IT APPEARS WE ARE RELIVING A SCENE AND GROUNDHOG DAY EACH DAY WE LEARN OF A NEW BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH DETAILS STILL TO BE DETERMINED AND A RUSH TIME LINE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND THEN WE REPEAT THIS DYNAMIC OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WELL MAYBE THE BETTER ANALOGY IS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS BUDGETING LIKE EVERY IPHONE UPDATE USERS UPDATE THEIR PHONES ONLY TO SEE THAT ANOTHER UPDATE NEED TO TAKE PLACE. RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON BUDGET THREE POINT NOW. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR IS FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGING. THAT HIS PREVIOUS BUDGETS WERE NOT ENOUGH ESPECIALLY A WILDFIRE PREVENTION THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE DEMANDED. COMMUNITIES ARE BEGGING. MORE LIKE PLEADING TO GET MORE DONE WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTING WILDFIRES. CAL FIRE IS DOING ALL THEY CAN. BUT THEY NEED MORE RESOURCES AND HELP AND ESPECIALLY MORE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE READY. AND WILLING TO HELP IN THE FIGHT TO PREVENT MORE FIRES. WE NEED A SENSE OF URGENCY. WE NEED TO ACT NOW AND WE NEED TO COMMIT MORE FUNDING ON A CONTINUOUS AND ONGOING BASIS FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. AND WE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THESE CRITICAL WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS. ENABLING AND MOBILIZING ARE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL NONPROFITS TO DO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. HAS TO BE A TOP PRIORITY AS WE FACE AN EXTREME DROUGHT IN ALREADY HOT SUMMER. AFTER THIS FUNDING IS APPROVED WE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY. THREE YEARS AGO I STOOD WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM PARADISE AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. I ALONG WITH A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF MEMBERS HEARD A HEART WRENCHING STORIES FROM FAMILIES OF THEIR ESCAPE FROM THE CAMP FIRE THAT TOOK EIGHTY FIVE LIVES. AND DISPLACED NEARLY AN ENTIRE TOWN. THAT SCHOOL WAS SAVED BECAUSE A FORCE MANAGEMENT THAT WAS DONE WELL BUILDINGS IN HOMES ACROSS THE WAY WERE DESTROYED. MANY OF US HAVE OUR OWN MEMORIES WITNESSING THE DEVASTATION FROM KESARI WILDFIRES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES WE KNOW WHAT MUST BE DONE AND NOW WE MUST ACT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY. ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES VERY. THANK YOU MR FONG MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEMBERS- I DO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS TRAILER BILL TODAY- BUT WE ARE FOOLING OURSELVES. IF WE THINK THAT THIS TAKES CARE OF THE PROBLEM- ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION NOW I'VE- SPOKEN ON THIS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE SUSTAINED FUNDING EVERY YEAR IN THIS BUDGET TO DO THE WORK THAT WE ALL NEEDS THAT WE ALL KNOW NEEDS TO BE DONE. TO TRULY GET ON TOP OF THIS PROBLEM TO HELP PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. TO PROTECT OUR AIR. AND TO PROTECT. THE CARBON EMISSIONS GOALS THAT WE HAVE SET. FOR THIS STATE. WE NEED TO BE DOING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR. OF PREVENTION TREATMENT. RECENT ARTICLES REVEALED THAT WE DID A LEVIN THOUSAND. A. KERR'S UNDER A STREAMLINED SEQUEL PROCESS. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT GETTING THE JOB DONE. NOW THIS TRAILER BILL AUTHORIZES ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS THE GENERAL FUND. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT THE PROBLEM IS. IT DOESN'T APPROPRIATE THAT MONEY. IT DOESN'T GET IT OUT TO THOSE WHO NEED TO DO THE WORK. IT SAYS AND I QUOTE UPON THE ORDER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. UP TO AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A GENERAL FUND MONIES MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION THAT'S THE SAME. ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THEY TOLD US LAST WEEK THERE ARE CAPACITY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SHOVEL READY PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD. THE SAME ADMINISTRATION THAT HASN'T GOTTEN THE JOB DONE ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION ALREADY DID ONLY DID ELEVEN THOUSAND WHEN THEY SAID THEY DID NINETY THOUSAND. THAT'S THE SAME ADMINISTRATION. THEY CONTINUES TO THWART THE WILL OF THIS LEGISLATURE AND DO ITS OWN THING AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT ALL THE POWER IN THE ABILITY USE THIS MONEY ONCE AGAIN IN THE GOVERNOR'S HANDS INSTEAD OF US DIRECTING THAT THAT MONEY BE SPENT ON PROJECTS THAT WE ALL KNOW. NEED TO BE DONE AND IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH CAPACITY THEY GET THE MONEY OUT TO THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS INTO THE NON PROFITS AND LET'S WORK WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO GET TO THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE MARK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. LET'S TREAT THIS WITH THE URGENCY. THAT WE ALL KNOW IT DESERVES. AND LET'S REMOVE THE BARRIERS LIKE SYKORA. THAT STOP PROJECTS FROM MOVING FORWARD LIKE BERRY CREEK THAT BURNED LAST YEAR READY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE FUNDING BUT IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS EQUAL PROCESS BEFORE THEY COULD DO ANYTHING. VERY CREEK IS NO LONGER THERE. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO STOP. I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH ANOTHER YEAR. AND WE NEED TO TREAT THIS WITH THE REAL URGENCY THAT THE SITUATION DEMANDS. AND I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO PUSH ON THIS. UNTIL WE GET THERE THANK YOU. THANKS GALLAGHER I SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM IS HURTING YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. SECOND SPEAKER. I KNOW THE TOPIC OF WILDFIRES ESPECIALLY AS WINTER WILDFIRE SEASON IS ONE THAT WE ALL SHARE A SENSE OF URGENCY ON. I WANT TO REMIND THIS BODY THAT AGAIN WILDFIRES ARE ONE OF THE MOST NATURAL OCCURRENCES. THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. WALFORD'S UNNATURAL. OUR CHALLENGE HAS BEEN WE NOW HAVE SPREAD TO LIVING IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. WHERE WE ARE NEXT TO FORESTS AND TREES IN THIS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF WILDFIRE PREVENTION. HAS BEEN BECAUSE OF YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF NEGLECT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS CREATED OVERNIGHT AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SOLVE OVERNIGHT. I KNOW THAT WE AS A BODY COMPLETELY FEEL THE SENSE OF URGENCY. THIS CODIFIES THE MONEY FOR POTENTIAL PREPARATION AND THE REASON THAT WE HAVEN'T. DELINEATE EXACTLY HOW MUCH% MONEY WE'RE SPENDING IS BECAUSE WE'RE DOING EXACTLY WHAT. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM NICKEL SAID WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING WE'RE NOT ALLOWING. THE ADMINISTRATION JUST TO SPEND THE MONEY ON WHATEVER PROJECT THEY WANT WE ARE ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. TO ENSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATION REFLECTS THIS BODY REFLECTS THE SENATE REALLY REFLECTS THE CONSTITUENTS UP AND DOWN. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL FOR AB ONE SIXTY ONE. THANK YOU MICHELLE. AND WITH THAT CLICK LIBERAL ALL MEMBERS VOTE. WE DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF VOTE.

CORPORATE ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THIRTY BY THE- MEDIA BUDGET AND ALKYLATING TO EDUCATE FINANCING MAKING APPROPRIATION OF COURSE TAKE A COMMUNITY PRIVILEGE OF THE BUDGET MISTER CAN YOU MAKE IT OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE TO PRESENT AB ONE THIRTY WHICH IS OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION TRAILER BILL. THIS LAST YEAR OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED LIKE NO OTHER TIME BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC. TEACHERS STRUGGLED TO TEACH CLASSES VIA ZOOM WE STRUGGLE TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS ENGAGE ESPECIALLY ARE VERY YOUNG STUDENTS WE WORKED VERY HARD AS A BODY TO GET OUR SCHOOLS TO COME BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WE HAD A VERY- BIG DEBATE ON WHAT WE COULD DO TO BRING OUR STUDENTS BACK TO BRING OUR TEACHERS BACK TO BRING OUR STAFF BACK. TODAY BECAUSE OF OUR RECORD SURPLUS. WE ARE STANDING TO PRESENT RECORD FUNDING. TO OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. THIS IS A FUNDING PROPOSAL TO SPEND OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A RECORD AMOUNT PER STUDENT. NINETY THREE BILLION DOLLARS ON PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. IT WITHIN THAT WE HAVE NUMEROUS PROPOSALS ARE OF WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS. OUR COLLEAGUE WHO CHAIRS UP TO AND FROM SACRAMENTO HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. FOR THE LAST DECADE. AND TODAY IS FINALLY THE DAY THAT WE ARE ANNOUNCING THAT NO MORE ARE WE GOING TO ONLY ALLOW 25% OF STUDENTS. TO HAVE UNIVERSAL T. K. 25% OF FOUR YEAR OLDS HAVE A TICKET NOW WE ARE MOVING TOWARD UNIVERSAL T. K. FOR EVERY SINGLE FOUR YEAR OLD. IN THIS STATE LONG OVERDUE. WE ARE PUTTING FOR TO PULL TO RUN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. SCHOOLS THAT ARE REALLY. ETHNOLOGY WHAT THE OUR SCHOOLS NOW ARE NO LONGER TO THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE GET EDUCATION. SCHOOLS ARE HELD FOR THE COMMUNITY. THERE WERE THE COMMUNITY GOES BEFORE SCHOOL THEY GO AFTER SCHOOL TO OUR CHILDREN GET FED. IT'S WERE CHILDREN GOOD VISION- APPOINTMENTS WITH THE GET DENTAL APPOINTMENTS WHERE THEY GET HEALTH CHECKS. FOR SCHOOLS ARE A MICROCOSM OF OUR COMMUNITY IN THIS THREE BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL ONE TIME PROPOSAL. LAUNCHES ARE STATEWIDE INITIATIVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN. IS TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO BE THE COMMUNITY HUBS BUT TO HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE COMMUNITY SO MANY. OF THESE RESOURCES ARE STRETCHED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FUNDING. WE'RE ALSO DOING EXPANDABILITY. WE SAW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CAN'T HAVE BEFORE SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL CHILDCARE. SO MANY FAMILIES DIDN'T GO BACK WHEN SCHOOLS REOPEN BECAUSE THERE WAS NO AFTER SCHOOL. SO WE ARE DOING A BILLION DOLLARS OF ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY. TO BULK UP OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM FOR SO MANY WORKING FAMILIES LIKE MINE YOU DON'T HAVE AFTER SCHOOL MANY OF OUR FAMILIES HAVE TO STRUGGLE. BETWEEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN WORKING OR ACTUALLY WATCHING THEIR CHILDREN AFTER SCHOOL. WITH ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT AS WELL SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. ONE TIME TO SERVE HALF OF OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN THE STATE. IT'S THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION FOR ONGOING POP NINETY A SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. TO INCREASE THE STATEWIDE BASE RATE FOR OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION FORMULA. WE ALSO DOUBLE THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT ACCESS TO CAREER AND COLLEGE PREP COURSEWORK AND TRAINING. AND LASTLY WE LAUNCH OUR FIRST UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS PROGRAM. WE HAVE WAY TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR STATE GOING HUNGRY EVERY DAY. AND QUITE OFTEN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE MEAL THAT THEY GOT AT SCHOOL THEY WOULD NECESSARILY GET A BILL AT ALL. SO THIS WILL REIMBURSE OUR STATE IS A STATE INCREASE IN STATE MEAL REIMBURSEMENTS BY FIFTY FOUR MILLION. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONGOING. IMPROPER NINETY BEGINNING AT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO COVER THE COSTS OF OFFERING BREAKFAST AND LUNCH FOR ALL STUDENTS. THIS BILL IS A TRULY TRANSFORMATIONAL BUDGET FOR OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM. REALLY PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR WHAT OUR SYSTEM HAS ALREADY BECOME. A COMMUNITY HUB WHERE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES RELY ON FOOD ON HEALTHCARE SOCIAL SERVICES ALL IN AFRICA SO THAT THEY CAN GO TO WORK. WITH THAT I'M VERY PROUD TO PRESENT TO YOU AB ONE THIRTY RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANKS FOR STAYING MISTER FONG YOUR RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER WHILE THIS BILL DOES ADDRESS THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DEFERRALS THAT SCHOOLDISTRICTS ARE FACING. I'M AFRAID THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FRUSTRATION FOR OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT MOVES AWAY FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF LOCAL CONTROL. AND FORTUNATELY ADOPT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO DELIVERING EDUCATION AND SCHOOL SERVICES OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE CORRECTLY MOVED MORE AND MORE DECISIONS AWAY FROM SACRAMENTO. AND HAVE SOUGHT TO EMPOWER LOCAL SCHOOLS WE CANNOT IGNORE THE REALITY THAT WE HAVE OVER NINE HUNDRED DISTINCT INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT. ALL WITH THEIR OWN UNIQUE STRUGGLES AND OPPORTUNITIES HOLDING. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SPECIAL EDUCATION OVERLOOKS THE REALITY THAT THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS VERY ACROSS OUR DIVERSE STATE. THIS BILL ALSO SPENDS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEW AND EXPANDED CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS WITH ADDITIONAL ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL BOG DOWN SCHOOL DISTRICTS UNDER MORE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND PRIORITIZE COMPLIANCE. OVER COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS BASED ON LOCAL NEEDS THE SOLUTION DOES NOT LIE IN UNIFORMITY AND STANDARDIZATION. THE SOLUTION LIES WITH OUR LOCAL SCHOL DISTRICTS TEACHERS FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WHO KNOW THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND HOW BEST TO MEET THEM WE MUST ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO INNOVATE AND ADAPT. AND USE THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO ADDRESS THE BEST NEEDS OF THEIR LOCAL STUDENTS. NO TOOLS NO TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THE SAME JUST LIKE NO TWO CHILDREN ARE LIKE. SCHOOLS IN KERN COUNTY ARE NOT THE SAME AS SCHOOLS IN LOS ANGELES AND WE CANNOT TREAT THEM THE SAME. SCHOOL CHOICE FREEDOMS. HAVE BEEN SHIPPED AWAY FOR YEARS AND THIS BILL IS NOTHING SHORT OF AN AGGRESSIVE TARGETING OF CHARTER SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS IN INDEPENDENCE DAY PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDED IMMEDIATE QUALITY EDUCATION WELL STUDENTS AND PARENTS WERE PERSEVERING. THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING. OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TEACHERS PARENTS AND STUDENTS HAVE PERSEVERED INDEED THE TRYING TIMES MUCH HAS BEEN ASKED OF OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. SACRAMENTO SHOULD NOT BE TAKING MORE POWER BUT SHOULD BE EMPOWERING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE HAVE AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM THE SOLUTIONS ARE LOCAL DISTRICTS AND FAMILIES HELPED US FIND TO ADAPT FOR FROM A JUST CONSTANTLY CHANGING EDUCATIONAL VARMINT. BUT TO MOVE BACK TO AN OLD INEFFECTIVE TOP DOWN SYSTEM MISSES THE MARK I AM FORTUNATELY URGE ANOTHER. MS CREEK SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I STAND AND RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE THIRTY OUR BUDGET AT TRAILER BILL FOR EDUCATION. THIS BILL SIMPLY SHOWS A HUGE INVESTMENT INTO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND AREAS OF EDUCATION THAT HAVE LACKED FUNDING IN THE PAST. THIS BILL FUNDS UNIVERSAL T. K. WHICH WE KNOW HAS BEEN AN AREA THAT WHEN OUR YOUNG CHILDREN START EARLY WITH EDUCATION THEY HAVE MUCH MUCH MORE CHANCES OF SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE. IT FUNDS DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS WHICH WE KNOW THAT WHEN CHILDREN SPEAK MORE-THAN ONE LANGUAGE THEY HAVE MANY MANY OPPORTUNITIES AND THE YOUNGER THAT THEY LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE THE BETTER SUCCESS THEY HAVE. THIS BILL INVEST IN MENTAL HEALTH FOR OUR STUDENTS AS WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC YEAR FOR PARENTS TEACHERS STUDENTS AND WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS NEED THAT SUPPORT. IT SUPPORTS FOSTER CHILDREN. AND AS WAS MENTIONED IT'S SUPPORT INVESTING AND LUNCHES STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL WORRIED THAT THEY WILL BE EMBARRASSED AS THEY GO INTO THE LINE. TO PURCHASE A SCHOOL LUNCH AND THEN BEING SENT OUT TO ANOTHER LINE WITH A BROWN BAG LUNCH THAT SAYS YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR LUNCH SO THEREFORE WE'LL GIVE YOU THIS PAPER BAG WITH AN APPLE IN IT. THING THAT ALL TOO MANY TIMES. IN ADDITION THIS BUDGET FOCUSES ON AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WE KNOW THOSE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS OR WHERE WE SAVE KIDS WE SAVE KIDS FROM GOING HOME. TO FAMILIES THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE CHILD CARE THEY'RE BUSY THEY'RE DOING THEIR HOMEWORK AND THAT'S WHERE WE WANT THEM. SIX A GOOD INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT AB ONE THIRTY. AMOS QUICK SILVA MISRATA THERE'S YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT A LOT OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES AND SUB TO AND I HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR HAS MADE IT INTO THE BUDGET WE FOUGHT SO HARD TO GET INCREASE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR THE UNIVERSAL T. K. EXPANSION AND FOR THE STATE TO RESPONSIBLY ALLOCATE FUNDS TO PAY BACK T. K. THROUGH TWELVE DEFERRALS. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY S THAT MOVING FORWARD WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT EDUCATION FUNDING WORKS FOR EVERYONE WE SHOULD WORK TOWARDS ALLOCATING FUTURE INCREASES AND PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS. TO MORE FULLY SUPPORT OUR BASE FUNDING THROUGHOUT THE FF YES A 5% INCREASE IN BASE FUNDING IS GREAT. BUT WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT WHILE EXPANDING CATEGORICAL GRANTS IS HELPFUL TO SOME. IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE BLESSING THAT IT SEEMS. THE GROWTH IN CATEGORICAL FUNDING SHIFT CONTROL AWAY FROM OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY NEED THEY NEED FLEXIBILITY. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT SACRAMENTO DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW BEST AND SHOULDN'T PRETEND TO. SO TODAY I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS AND I ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE AND GIVE OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS MORE CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY THANK YOU. THANK OF HIS FATHER'S MISTER MATHIS. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. YOU KNOW IN LOOKING AT THIS FOR EDUCATION. IN LOOKING AT THE TIME THAT I'VE SPENT WITH THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN THE MAKE UP MY DISTRICT. IN TALKING TO THEM THE BIGGEST THING THAT I'VE LEARNED FROM THE SCHOOLS OVER THE YEARS IS. WE NEED MORE LOCAL CONTROL. WE NEED A FLOOR FOR OUR SMALL DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS WHO SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD ALL THESE GREAT PROGRAMS. THIS DOES NOT PROVIDE THAT FOR THEM. THIS STILL LEAVES THEM OUT. IT I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES A LOT OF REALLY GOOD THINGS HERE THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF REALLY BAD THINGS HERE. I'VE TALKED TO MY SUPERINTENDENT I ASK YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS AND THEY'RE LIKE AB IS. IT'S GOOD AND BAD WHAT I KNOW IS WE CAN DO BETTER. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THROWING OUT THE LOCAL CONTROL. THAT MANY OF US. HAVE PUT SWEAT EQUITY IN. UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO TRY TO MAKE IT BETTER WORDS GONNA THROW THAT OUT. IT REALLY MAKES ME QUESTION. THE TRANSPARENCY OF THIS WE ALL KNOW WE DIDN'T DO A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WE DIDN'T DO THESE OTHER THINGS WE DIDN'T MAKE IT. YOU KNOW. THE WAY WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE. THANKFULLY WE WE'VE ALL HAD A LITTLE. BIT MORE TIME TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT IT HAVE SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THE MEMBERS I MEAN SERIOUSLY YOU. TO THROW OUT THE LOCAL CONTROL FORMULA THAT WE'VE ALL WORKED ON. SOME OF Y'ALL NINE YEARS SOME OF US SEVEN YEARS. SOME OF US ALITTLE BIT LESS BUT TO THROW THAT AWAY. NOW AFTER THE PANDEMIC AFTER WE KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE BEGGING US. MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD CORRECT WITH OVER NINE HUNDRED DIFFERENT DISTRICTS IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WORKS DIFFERENTLY. THEIR POPULATIONS ARE DIFFERENT THEIR CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY. THE ONE TOOL THAT IS NECESSARY. TO HELP THEM ADDRESS THEIR LOCAL POPULATIONS MEMBERS WE CAN DO BETTER. I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL. TO DO THAT I'M NOT VOTING ON THIS AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU. MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- AND I DO WANT TO SIDE START BY SAYING I THINK THERE WAS SOME SOME VERY INCREDIBLE BIPARTISAN WORK DONE THIS YEAR IN THE EDUCATION BUDGET SUB- AND I GIVE CREDIT TO THE CHAIRMAN. OF THAT SUBCOMMITTEE AS WE WORK THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES AND I THINK THERE IS. YOU KNOW AS HAS BEEN SAID I THINK THERE'S SOME VERY POSITIVE THINGS- THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH THAT WORK- I WISH THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY PUSH FORWARD OF ONE OUT. IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR. BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO POINT TO IN TERMS OF THE INCREASES TO SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE INCREASE IN AND ENSURING THAT THERE WOULD BE A COLA INCREASE FOR C. T. VITAL CTE PROGRAMS THAT WE NEED. IN OUR SCHOOLS THERE ARE THINGS I THINK WE CAN POINT TO A RECORD. EDUCATION FUNDING BUDGET. GETTING FUNDING OTHERS DESPERATELY NEEDED IN AND ESPECIALLY WITH EVERYTHING THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN THIS PAST YEAR ALL POSITIVE THINGS BUT UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SUPPORT. THIS TRAILER BILL IN THIS ULTIMATE DEAL TODAY AND I WANT TO OUTLINE WHY. BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. NUMBER ONE THIS BILL UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE INDEPENDENT STUDY REQUIREMENTS THOUGH I THINK ARE A GOOD TOOL TO ENSURE THAT OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS DON'T PLAY GAMES. LIKE SAN FRANCISCO DID SEVER CISCO UNIFIED DID AND NOT OPENING AND HAVING IT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO APPLY TO USE A BACK DOOR TO SOMEHOW USE INDEPENDENT STUDY TO GET AT. NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS WHO ACTUALLY WERE THE SAVING GRACE. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND ACTUALLY PERFORMED VERY WELL AND HELP ENSURE THAT KIDS WERE GETTING AN ADEQUATE EDUCATION AT A TIME WHEN THEY COULD NOT BE. IN PERSON. WE ACTUALLY GROWTH IN PEOPLE GOING TO NON CLASSROOM BAY CHARTERS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THE CONTINUE MORATORIUM ON NOT ALLOWING ANY MORE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS IS UNFAIR AND IT SHOULD BE PART OF THIS DEAL. IN ADDITION TO IT SHUTS DOWN FUNDING FOR ANY CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR THE NEW EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. OUR NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THAT. THIS IS A AND KEEP IN MIND THIS IS A CATEGORICAL PROGRAM NOW THAT WE'RE CREATING THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES BUT WE'RE GOING TO SAY THAT NON CLASSROOM THAT CHARTERS. CAN'T HAVE THAT. THAT'S WRONG. IT'S WRONG TO BE IN THIS TRAILER BILL. AT THE LAST MINUTE TO PUT THESE THINGS IN HERE. THE OTHER THING IS CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING INSTEAD OF HAVING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR ALL DISTRICTS IS WRONG THE GOVERNOR IS THE ONE WHO PUSH THAT BY THE WAY THE GOVERNOR SAID MONEY SHOULD GO TO CONCENTRATION. GRANTS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT MEANS THAT ONLY CERTAIN SCHOOLS WILL GET THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND THAT MEANS THAT LOW INCOME. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER KIDS IN OTHER SCHOOLS WON'T GET THAT INCREASE FUNDING AND THAT IS WRONG. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE PUSHED BACK AGAINST THE GOVERNOR AND SAID NO WE'RE DOING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING ACROSS THE BOARD TO HELP ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN ALL KIDS. I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED WITH RECORD FUNDING THEY WERE PUTTING OUT THERE THERE IS A VERY DANGEROUS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. IN THIS BILL AND I'LL POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS. THE DASHBOARD IS ONCE AGAIN SUSPENDED. YEAH I KNOW THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET-COMMITTEE AGREES WITH ME ON THIS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THAT ACCOUNTABILITY BACK WE NEED TO HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION'S FEET TO THE FIRE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE'RE WE'RE LOSING TWO YEARS TWO YEARS WORTH OF DATA THAT. COULD BE HELPFUL. AND HELPING US TO ADDRESS LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS TO MAKE SURE THOSE KIDS IN THOSE SCHOOLS ULTIMATELY. ARE GETTING A GOOD EDUCATION AND THERE'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. COMING IN TO HELP SUPPORT SCHOOLS THAT AREN'T MEET THAT AREN'T MAKING THE GRADE. WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THIS BUDGET WE TAKE IT OUT WE WAIVE. IN THIS BUDGET WE WAIVE UNANNOUNCED VISITS TO LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS WHICH IS WHERE THAT. THIRTY SECONDS AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURETHAT NONE OF OUR KIDS ARE FALLING BEHIND AND ALTERNATELY AND THIS IS. A BIT OF A CHANGE OF HEART FOR ME I THINK THAT THE T. K. FOCUS. IS THE WRONG POLICY CHOICES AND I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT THIS YEAR. BUT BY FOCUSING THAT MONEY ON T. K. WHERE WE DON'T HAVE WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES. INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OF CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION I THINK IS ULTIMATELY THE WRONG. POLICY CHOICES THINK WE WILL FIND THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY. SUSTAINABLY TO HAVE THESE T. K. PROGRAMS WE SHOULD INSTEAD REALLY FOCUSING ON EXPANDING- EXPANDING SLOTS IN EARLY EDUCATION. AND CHILDCARE AND M. AND WE DO IN THIS ENSURE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BUT THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUS I THINK TRULY NEEDS TO BE TO ENSURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE READY. WHEN THEY START KINDERGARTEN THANK YOU. MISTER GIBSON YOUR RECOGNIZE.

MALE TEACHERS OF COLOR IN EDUCATION ALSO IT HAS A NEXUS WITH AB FIVE TWENTY THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL ALSO PROVIDES ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS EDUCATORS AFFECT OF THIS OF BLOCK GRANTS TO EXPEDITE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS AND STAFF. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I AM A STEWARD FOR CHANGE. AND I AM PROUD THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THE RIGHT DIRECTION EXPRESSLY AFTER A VERY VERY VERY TOUGH YEAR THAT WE ALL FACE AND GOING THROUGH EQUITY NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE A GUIDING- CENTERPIECE FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN THIS HOUSE LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN AND FOR THOSE ARE IN THE BACK SO THEY CAN HEAR ME CLEARLY. I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LENS TO BETTER COMMUNITIES THAT FOR FAR TOO LONG HAVE ONLY J. HAVE ONLY JUST NEEDED A FAIR SHOT AND A SEAT AT THE TABLE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SEPT SHARES I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS THE RIGHT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION NOW RESPECTFULLY ASK A STRONG AYE VOTE. ALL AB ONE THIRTY. THANK IMAGE CAPTION MR MURATSUCHI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE AS A PARENT AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND AS A FORMER CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. NUMBER TWO. TO SAY THAT. WE HAVE AS A OUR BUDGET SHERMAN SAID. MANY TIMES WE HAVE COME SUCH OF A LONG WAYS. IN THIS BUDGET THIS HAS SO MANY GREAT THINGS IN THE BUDGET YOU KNOW FROM THE 5% COLA. PAYING OFF ALL DEFERRALS INSTANT RELIEF. SPECIAL EDUCATION INCREASING AND FUNDING INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION I MEAN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS THIS. THIS BILL. BUT I. ALSO AS A FORMER CHAIR BUDGET SUB TO I WANT TO. ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHT THE AGREEMENT WITH SO MY COLLEAGUES. CROSS THE AISLE MY COLLEAGUES FROM SANTA CLARITA. AND FROM NICOLAS. WHILE WE TALK ABOUT THE INCREASES AND PER PUPIL FUNDING THAT THIS BUDGET PROVIDES. WE ARE INCREASINGLY SEEING. AND MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS A TALE OF TWO CITIES DISTRICTS THAT NEIGHBOR EACH OTHER ONE THAT IS A CONCENTRATION. GRANT ELIGIBLE DISTRICT AND ONE IS NOT. CASE IN POINT IN MY DISTRICT. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED IN TORRANCE UNIFIED. NEIGHBOR RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER THERE'S ONLY ONE ROAD THAT SEPARATES LA UNIFIED FROM TORRANCE UNIFIED WESTERN AT WESTERN AVENUE. THE BIG STREET AND LOS ANGELES TO ST THAT'S FAMILIAR TO MANY OF US IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. TORRANCE UNIFIED HAS ALMOST 40% OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER STUDENTS FOSTER KIDS. AND YET TORRANCE UNIFIED GETS 40% LESS AND ABA FUNDING THE NEIGHBORING LOS ANGELES UNIFIED. YOU KNOW. I AM WAITING. JUST SAYS BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WHEN THERE WERE FAMILIES THAT CHALLENGED. THE INEVITABLE STATE FUNDING SYSTEM THROUGH A SERIES OF LAWSUITS THE SERRANO VERSUS PRIEST LAWSUITS. THAT INVALIDATED THE STATE FUNDING BASED ON A DENIAL OF EQUAL PROTECTION OF EQUAL. OF EQUAL TREATMENT I AM WAITING TO SEE IF SOMEONE SOMEWHERE IN THE STATE RISES UP TO CHALLENGE THOSE GROWING INEQUITIES I KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE WE TRY. TO WE PUT WE PROPOSE WE PASSED THE COMPROMISE THE LEGISLATIVE. BUDGET HAD THE DOLLARS TO FOLLOW THE DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS WITH. THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS BUT THIS ABBASI'S ON THE CONCENTRATION GRANTS THAT THE GOVERNOR INSISTED INSISTED UPON AS A STEP AWAY FROM YOU CAN PROTECTION FOR ALL STUDENTS. AND SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. THE INADEQUACY OF THE BASE GRANT YOU KNOW THE BREAD AND BUTTER FUNDING THAT GOES TO ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE. THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE. FUNDING I MEAN THIS THIS BUDGET BECAUSE IT HAS SO MUCH MONEY ONE TIME FUNDS FOR EVERYONE IT MASKS A LOT OF THESE. OF THESE PROBLEMS BUT BUT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. THE GROWING INEQUITY IN TERMS OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WELL WITH ALL OF YOU TO ADDRESS THIS ONGOING ISSUE. AMOS MURATSUCHI MR KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. FOR FIFTEEN MONTHS CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR NO GOOD REASON WE'VE BEEN FORTY NINTH OR FIFTIETH IN THE COUNTRY IN GETTING KIDS BACK TO THE CLASSROOM AND IS THIS RESULTED IN SOME GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN DISEASE CONTROL NOW WE'VE DONE AS BAD OR POORLY AS STATES WHERE KIDS HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL. FULL TIME. SO YOU THINK WE'LL BE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. BUT INSTEAD THIS BILL EXPLICITLY CONTEMPLATES. A PERMANENT POLICY OF NON DATA BASED SHUTDOWNS. BUT EVEN BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN. CALIFORNIA'S UNDER PERFORMANCE WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC EDUCATION WAS STAGGERING WE HAD SOME OF THE NATION'S LARGEST ACHIEVEMENT GAPS WE RANK FORTY NINE. AT A FIFTY IN EDUCATION IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND IT'S EASY TO BECOME DESENSITIZED TO THESE NUMBERS BECAUSE WE'RE LAST IN SO MANY THINGS BUT THAT'S MILLIONSOF KIDS WHO ARE NOT GETTING THE EDUCATION THEY NEED SOME OF THEM EVEN SUED THE STATE SUCCESSFULLY. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING TAUGHT THREE. SO WHAT DOES THIS BILL O WELL IT PROVIDES FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN FUNDING. AND THAT MAY COME AS GOOD NEWS TO SOME BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE IT'S GOOD NEWS. FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS. ARE EDUCATION SPENDING HAS INCREASED BY SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST DECADE WITH NO DEMONSTRABLE IMPACT. ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. SO IF THE LAST SIXTY BILLION DIDN'T HELP. WHILE THE NEXT FOURTEEN BILLION. IN FACT THIS BILL REINFORCES. A FAILING MODEL IT DIED REINFORCES A MODEL WHERE KIDS ARE ASSIGNED TO ONE SCHOOL AND THEY ARE EXPECTED TO GO TO THAT SCHOOL WHAT ARE THEY LIKE IT OR NOT WHETHER IT'S A GOOD SCHOOL OR NOT WHETHER IT'S OPEN OR NOT AND THEN DISTRICTS ARE JUDGED BASED UPON THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH STATE MANDATES RATHER THAN THEIR RECORD. OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. WE CAN DO SO MUCH GOOD FOR SO MANY KIDS WITH SOME COMMONSENSE REFORMS IT'S NOT BRAIN SURGERY LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WAS HAS WORKED IN OTHER STATES. TO HELP KIDS LEARN TO HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED AND LET'S START DOING IT HERE. WE DO NOT NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROP UP AND REINFORCE A FAILED PUBLIC EDUCATION MODEL WE NEED FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION REFORM IN CALIFORNIA. MR MCCARTY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER WE KNOW THAT. OVER HALF OF OUR STATE BUDGET GOES TO OUR MOST IMPORTANT OUR PRIORITY IS EDUCATING OUR YOUTH AND OUR FUTURE FROM EARLY AT TO COLLEGE WE KNOW THE 40% GOES TO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM NTK THREE TWELVE THIS IS A BUDGET THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT EDUCATORS AND FRANKLY LAWMAKERS. HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR GENERATIONS ADEQUATELY FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND FOCUSING ON ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ON OUR WISH LIST FOR A LONG TIME MAKING SURE WE HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO PRE K. PROGRAMS FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA. MAKING SURE WE HAVE UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS SO KIDS CAN LEARN AND NOT BE HUNGRY. EVERY MEMBER HERE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT IMPROVING CTP PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. STUDENTS CAN FOCUS ON CAREER AND POTENTIALLY HIGHER EDUCATION WE DOUBLE MONEY FOR C. T. E. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON THE A. THREE G. IMPROVEMENT GRANT TO HELP STUDENTS GET READY. AND TAKE EIGHT THIRTY COURSES THE GOING THROUGH COLLEGE. AND YES WE DO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO WEEK REAL PUT OUR SCHOOLS THIS FALL. WE GET RID OF THE POLICY THAT HAS- SCHOOLS BE ABLE TO DO THE DISTANCE LEARNING AND THE AND THE BIFURCATED ZOOM SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT WAS AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER. SO WE ARE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL WITH FULLY FUNDED. PROGRAMS THIS FALL MAKE NO MISTAKE. BUT I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE THAT THE THAT THAT THIS SOMEHOW WASN'T A PROCESS WE LOOKED INTO THE CONSIDERATION OF ALL SCHOOLS AND ALL DISTRICTS THIS WAS A VERY CONSENSUS DRIVEN PROCESS IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE PROBABLY ACTIONS. AND THIS NOTION THAT WE GET AWAY FROM LOCAL CONTROL IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE ADOPTED THE L. C. F. F. POLICY. THAT FOCUSES ON GIVING MORE MONEY TO OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THEY CAN MAKE THEIR CHOICES. WE DO THAT WE FOCUS ON THE BASIS OF FUNDING WE ALSO REALIZE. THAT SCHOOLS THEY GET MORE MONEY THEY HAVE MORE PROBLEMS AND I'D LIKE TO ASK ANY OF YOU AND YOUR COMMUNITIES IF YOU SAY YOU WANT MORE MONEY THAN THE SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET. DO YOU WANT A SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES THAT FOCUSES ON OVER SOMETIMES 70% OF YOUR STUDENTS. OTHER LOW INCOME FOSTER YOUTH ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BECAUSE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EDUCATING THESE SCHOOLS THESE COMMUNITIES COST MORE MONEY THAT WAS. THE CHOICE THAT WE MADE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT A DECADE AGO WE FOLLOW THIS TO THE LAW. AND WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS WHAT WORKS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN LIFT EVERYBODY UP. OUT OF POVERTY AND BRING EDUCATION LEVELS ACROSS ACROSS THE BOARD. SO THIS IS THE PREMISE THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING HERE FOR TEN YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE INCREASE IN ALL FUNDING THIS YEAR. RIGHTFULLY SO THE SCHOOLS WITH THE MOST AMOUNT OF CHALLENGE OF THE MOST AMOUNT TO HELP. GET THE MOST AMOUNT OF SUPPORT. THIS IS GOOD FOR OUR STUDENTS A GOOD FOR A GUY CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. ASK YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY THANK YOU MEMBERS SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MR TANG YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER REALLY APPRECIATE THIS VERY. ROBUST DEBATE ON FRANKLY PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT WE TALK ABOUT. ALL YEAR. THIS BILL AS I MENTIONED EARLIER REALLY REFLECTS. WHAT SCHOOLS HAVE BECOME. WE HAVE DEVASTATED OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NETS ARE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. ALL ACROSS THIS PARTICULAR COUNTRY WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO COME BACK FROM ALL THOSE CUTS DURING THE LAST GREAT RECESSION. IF SO WHAT DOES HAPPEN TO ALL THOSE FAMILIES BECAUSE THOSE FAMILIES WHO NEEDED HELP. DIDN'T STOP NEEDING HELP BECAUSE- SERVICES GOT CUT. THEY WENT TO THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THEY COULD GO. WHICH WHICH QUITE OFTEN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL. THOSE CHILDREN TURN TO SCHOOLS FOR FOOD FAMILIES TURN TO SCHOOLS FOR HEALTH CARE WHETHER THAT WAS VISION OR DENTAL OR THE SCHOOL NURSE. WE ALL KNOW THAT IF STUDENTS AREN'T HEALTHY OR THEY'RE NOT FED THEY CAN'T LEARN. SO THIS BILL ETHNOLOGIST THE HUGE ROLE THAT EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL PLAYS AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FED FOR STUDENTS ARE HEALTHY BUT THE CARE FOR THAT THE WATCH FOR. AND THIS DOESN'T MOVE ANY MONEY AWAY FROM LOCAL CONTROL. THE LOCAL CONTROL CONTINUES TO BE INCLUDE THE FUNDING CONTINUES TO BE INCREASED. BUT LET'S REMEMBER WHAT ARE OUR DEBATE WAS FOUR MONTHS AGO. BECAUSE FOUR MONTHS AGO WE WEREN'T LOBBYING LOCAL CONTROL AND IF I WAS INVOLVED IN LOOKING CONTROL BECAUSE LOCAL CONTROL COSTS ALMOST ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STREET TO BE CLOSED. I WANT TO CLOSE THIS LOCAL CONTROL STRUGGLED WITH BEING ABLE TO OPEN OUR SCHOOLS EXCEPT FOR THE- FEW MINUTES FEW MINORITY OF SCHOOLS. SO AGAIN. THIS BILL ENSURES OUR SCHOOLS WILL BE OPEN IN THE FALL NOT ONLY ARE THEY GOING TO BE OPEN INVOLVED ACTUALLY GONNA GET THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO DO SO MANY OF THE CRITICAL SERVICES THEY'VE ALREADY PROVIDED FOR KIDS WITH THEIR TO EDUCATING OUR KIDS MAKING SURE TEACHERS AND STAFF HAVE MORE RESOURCES WHETHER IT'S TAKING CARE KIDS BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL WHETHER IT'S FEEDING OUR CHILDREN WITH THEIR TO ENSURING THAT THOSE WITH DISABILITIES OF THOSE WHO NEED A LITTLE MORE HELP OF SPECIAL EDUCATION GET. THE RESOURCES AND THE HELP THAT THEY SORELY SORELY NEEDS THIS IS REALLY. A LANDMARK BILL THIS IS A BILL THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LET THIS BILL BE DERAILED BY ONE SPECIAL INTERESTS. OR BECAUSE ONE SPECIAL INTERESTS THE HAS HAS THIS HAS AN OBJECTION ON THIS BILL. I THINK THE BIGGEST WINNER. ARE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS BIGGEST WINNER OUR CHILDREN'S IN OUR FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL IN AB ONE THIRTY. THANK YOU MUCH TAKE WITHOUT CLERK WILL OPEN.
