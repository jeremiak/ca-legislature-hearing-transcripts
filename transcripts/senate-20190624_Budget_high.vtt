AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER SO

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.626
THE WAY THIS TRAILER BILL

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.194
STRUCTURED IS TO MEET THAT GOAL --

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.162

CONSOLIDATION -- WATER SOURCES

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.701

ACCESS TO THE WATER GET THE

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.480
RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.148
THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES --

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.350

CONTROL BOARD WHICH IS

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.521
RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING TOGETHER

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:10.189
THE FUND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.858
SO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO NOT

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:12.992
ONLY HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER THAT

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.359

MEETING A YEAR TO YEAR.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.666
AND SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.000
PROVISIONS AND HAPPY TO TAKE

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:28.608

NIELSEN.

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:33.680
AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE ARE NO

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:34.914
THEN TAX INCREASES IT AT ALL IN

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:35.949
HERE'S STRICTLY GENERAL FUND AND

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.550
GREENHOUSE GAS CORRECT THAT'S

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:38.184
CORRECT THIS IS A MAJORITY VOTE

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.721
BILL. SEVEN TO WORK OWSKI ON THE

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:45.592
UNIVERSE -- ON PAGE. THIRTEEN OF

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:46.726
THE BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:47.493
SMALL.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.096
OUR STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.532
OUR SYSTEM SAID HAVE UP TO

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.566
FOURTEEN HOOKUPS MY

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.268
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT OF THE

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:56.069
MILLION PEOPLE THAT YOU

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.237
REFERENCE ABOUT HALF OF THEM.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.639
MEET THAT JURISDICTION AND THE

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.642
OTHER HALF ARE OUTSIDE THE STATE

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.311
WATER RESOURCES.

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:12.619
CONTROL BOARD IS THAT CORRECT.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:13.353
A THIRD I GOT THE PART OF

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.120
FINANCE SO I'M NOT SURE THE

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:15.588
PACIFIC BREAK OUT BETWEEN THE

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.624
SMALLS AND THE LARGER COMMUTERS

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.658
AND WE COULD DEFINITELY PROVIDE

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.628
THAT -- INFORMATION AFTERWARDS.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.162
SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.897
THESE GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS IF

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.366
THE STATE.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.767
MORTARBOARD DOES NOT HAVE

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.403
JURISDICTION OF WITH.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.173
PEOPLE'S WELLS FOR PEOPLE THAT-HAVE SYSTEMS THAT ARE LESS THAN

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.708
FOURTEEN HOOK UPS.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.976
WE'RE STILL POINT TO PROVIDE

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.978
THOSE PEOPLE WITH ASSISTANCE.

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:40.279
EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:41.547
JURISDICTION OVER THEM.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.582
BASED ON THE LAW THE NEW

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.250
LANGUAGE I JUST SAW.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.785
YES SO -- THIS LANGUAGE DOES

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:47.353
PROVIDE THE AUTHORITY FOR THE

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.554
WATER BOARD TO HAPPEN TO HELP

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.489
THOSE INDIVIDUALS INTO THE

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:50.723
VENTURE COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.458
WHICH IS WHERE -- SOME OF THE

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:54.327
BIGGEST ISSUE LIES -- THEY DON'T

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:56.329
CURRENTLY HAVE THAT REGULATORY

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.397
POWER OVER THEM A LOT OF THESE

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.198
COMMUNITIES DO SUFFER FROM NOT

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:01.701
HAVING -- SAFE DRINKING WATER SO

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:03.569
THIS FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOWABLE

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.605
YOU SOURCE OF SUPPORT THOSE

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:05.938
COMMUNITIES.

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.241
SEC THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:10.476
BOARD HAS HAD TROUBLES GETTING.

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:12.378
SMALL SYSTEMS WITH FOURTEEN OR

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.847
MORE TO DO PROPER OPERATIONS TO

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.382
DO PROPER INVESTMENT TO DO THE

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.317
PROPER CONSOLIDATION WHEN WE

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:20.653
HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THEM BUT

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.121
WE CAN ACTUALLY WE GAVE THE

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:23.389
STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.025
AUTHORITY TO FORCE CONSOLIDATION

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.593
WITH THIS FEELING WATER SYSTEMS.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.095
ADMITTEDLY THAT MAY BE IN THE

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.230
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO HOW

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:35.802
ARE WE GOING TO GET THESE OTHER --

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.937
SMALL EVEN MY NEW SYSTEMS WHAT

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.106
TWELVE OR TEN HOOK UPS WE DON'T

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.508
HAVE ANY MUSCLE. TO FORCE THEM

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:45.545
TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN GIVE

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.580
THEM THE MONEY.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.248
HOW WOULD THAT OCCUR SO WHEN THE

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:50.583
WATER BOARD IT LOOK FAT --

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.417
DIFFERENT WAYS TO SUPPORT OF

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:55.321
THESE SYSTEMS ONE OF THE FIRST --

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.256
METHODS OF SUPPORT IS LOOKING AT

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:58.624
WHETHER THEY ARE ALGO FOR

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.293
CONSOLIDATION OR EXTENSION OF

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.728
SERVICE SITES CAN WANT ONE OF

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:05.164
THE PRIMARY -- WAVE TO TO SOLVE

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:05.765
THE PROBLEM OF THE WATER BOARD

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.867
CONSIDERS BEFORE THEY WOULD

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:08.501
CONSIDER OPERATIONS AND

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:10.636
MAINTENANCE CORRECT BUT THAT'S

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.438
FOR I GET THAT I I I KNOW THAT

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.639
WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.441
THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE FOURTEEN

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.744
HOOK UPS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.078
PEOPLE THAT HAVE SEVEN OR EIGHT

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:21.180
HOOK UPS OR SOMEBODY WHO JUST AS

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:21.914
A WELL.

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.916
THAT ADMITTEDLY HAS POOR GROUND

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:25.852
WATER AND IS NOT POSSIBLE THEY

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:27.754
THE THEY FALL INTO THIS MILLION

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.122
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE SAFE

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.289
DRINKING WATER.

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:34.560
WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:35.495
THEM TO ANYTHING.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:36.329
BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT WERE

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:38.531
TAKING GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS IN

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:40.933
MAKING I'M OF BAILABLE TO THEM.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.335
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT WOULD

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:45.338
HAPPEN.

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:47.807
PLEASE REMEMBER THIRTY RIGHT NOW.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:48.441
WE NEED TO THERE'S NOTHING IN

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:49.575
THIS BILL THAT GIVES US A STORY

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.244
WE HAD UNDERSTAND THERE'S A

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.780
PROBLEM HERE AND IN [inaudible]

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:57.550
SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE.

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.018
A METAL ME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.319
I BELIEVE THE BILL ALSO ONE OF

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:01.988
THE PURPOSES OF THE BILL IS FOR

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.422
THE WATER BOARD TO PROVIDE

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.424
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO THESE

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:06.759
COMMUNITIES TO SO THAT'S A GOOD

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:09.428
LIST OF EXAMPLE WHERE.

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:11.697
THERE MIGHT BE A SITUATION WHERE --

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.199
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PROVIDING

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.967
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.002
NEEDED FOR THOSE TYPES OF

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:18.070
SITUATIONS I MEAN THAT'S ONE OF

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:20.973
THE REASONS WHY -- IT'S KIND OF

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.443
A OF A IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.846
ALL THAT IT'S VERY ON THE EACH.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.915
COMMUNITY MIGHT HAVE SOME UNIQUE

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.316
NEEDS AND THAT'S WHERE THE

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.450
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMES IN

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.386
WHERE CONSOLIDATION MIGHT BE ONE

00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:35.321
TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX.

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:37.557
OF IN THEN WHEN -- THAT DOESN'T

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.358
WORK THEN THE TECHNICAL

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:41.127
ASSISTANCE FROM THE WATER BOARD

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:42.495
TO HELP THESE COMMUNITIES --

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:43.796
IDENTIFY WHAT THE PROPER

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:46.732
SOLUTION IS IN THAT PARTICULAR

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.367
SITUATION.

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.236
THE STATE HAS THAT ABILITY TO

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:51.637
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:53.840
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:56.475
JUSTICE BE AN ED -- OBJECTION

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.544
FROM THESE LOCAL OPERATING

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:02.014
SYSTEMS TO DELIVER THE SAFE

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:04.584
DRINKING WATER THAT WE WE SEE WE

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.585
SEE THAT WE WE WANT.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.086
AND THE LACK OF FUNDING SO THIS

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.855
PROVIDES THE FUNDING THAT WOULD

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:11.991
PROVIDE A POSSIBLE INCENTIVES

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.893
THAT WOULD MOVE THE NEEDLE.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.494
AND THAT KEEPS ME TO THE NEXT IT

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.930
PROVIDES FUNDING BUT DOESN'T YOU

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.131
KNOW HI I'VE RAISE SOME

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:21.334
QUESTIONS BEFORE ABOUT THE NEXUS

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.803
BETWEEN AB THIRTY TWO THAT

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.571
REQUIRES REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:27.073
GASES IN THE LANGUAGE.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:30.476
THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED HERE TOO

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:33.646
YOU KNOW -- IN TO INSERT CLIMATE

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.748
CHANGE AND ALL THAT YOU'LL SAID

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:37.383
KERR WITH CLIMATE CHANGE VERSUS

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.551
THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:39.752
GASES.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.921
I'M LOOKING AT PAGE SIX WORDS

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.890
YOU NEED TO FIND CLIMB IS

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.658
CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE CHANGE IS

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.560
EXASPERATING THE WATER IMPACTS

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:50.696
ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:51.898
REDUCING SURFACE FLOWS.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.165
EXCEL RING DECLINING GROUNDWATER

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:55.067
BASINS AND ALL THESE.

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.936
SORT OF A CATCH ALL OF OF ALL

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.971
THE ILLS AT ME OF KERR IN THE

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:03.576
WATER ARENA -- BUT THAT DOESN'T.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.978
HYPHEN THE NEXUS BETWEEN

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:09.715
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES -- AND

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:11.083
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE LANGUAGE

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.621
THAT YOU PUT IN HERE IN AB. ONE

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:20.326
HUNDRED SORT OF KILLS ANY ANY

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.495
HOPE THAT WE HAVE THAT AB.

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.097
THIRTY TWO SURVIVED UNTIL TWENTY

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:26.999
TWENTY ONE I'LL CONCEDE.

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:29.502
REGRETTABLY THAT IN TWENTY

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:32.071
TWENTY ONE BASED ON A. B. THREE

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.439
NINETY EIGHT THAT OU'RE ABLE TO

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:35.975
USE OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUND

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.343
FOR VARIETY DIFFERENT.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.578
DIFFERENT -- CHARGES BUT NOW

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:41.781
WITH THIS LEGISLATION IT SEEMS

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:43.482
THAT YOU WERE EXPANDING THE TYPE

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.217
OF ACTIONS A GREENHOUSE GASES

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:46.652
CAN BE.

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:48.521
BE USED IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:49.689
BEGINNING.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:52.458
ON THE ADOPTION OF THIS FOR

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:55.828
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND A

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:57.029
CATCH ALL IS THERE ANYTHING IF

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:59.365
THIS PASSES THAT GREENHOUSE GAS

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.567
REDUCTION FUNDS COULD BE USED

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:02.902
FOR GIVEN THE DEFINITION THAT WE

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:03.536
HAVE COMPUTER.

00:10:03.602 --> 00:10:05.604
CONTAINED IN THIS IS APPARENTLY

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:07.273
SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT THAT

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.976
EXPANDS THE FOR THE POLICY

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.344
THOUGH I A A JUST TO BE CLEAR I

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.378
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU ARE

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.014
LOOKING AT THE JUNE TWENTY FIRST

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.215
VERSION OF THE BILL.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.651
WHICH IS THE BILL THAT IS

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:21.854
CURRENTLY BEFORE BEFORE US.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.956
PURSUE SWITCH TODAY.

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:24.991
WHAT WILL THE JUNE?

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:26.492
YOUR REFERENCE TO WORKFORCE

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:28.995
DEVELOPMENT WAS A REFERENCE TO A

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:30.329
PRIOR VERSION OF THE BILL.

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:33.199
THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:34.400
WHICH WAS AMENDED ON JUNE TWENTY

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.502
FIRST.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:40.006
WHICH WAS ON FRIDAY -- HAS -- MY

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:41.507
HAS MORE NARAL LANGUAGE AND

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:42.742
THAT'S THE BILL THAT'S UNDER

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.610
CONSIDERATION NOW.

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:47.747
AND THE LANGUAGE OF THAT IS

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.248
CURRENTLY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.018
WOULD -- RESEARCH WOULD ALLOW OF

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:55.254
A WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO THE

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.524
APPROPRIATIONS OF THE SAFE AND

00:10:58.591 --> 00:10:59.425
FOR AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.192
FUND.

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:02.962
AND BASICALLY ONLY IN THAT

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.031
PARTICULAR APPROPRIATION OF

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:07.767
COULD THE WATER BOARD EITHER --

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.402
DEMONSTRATED RESULTS.

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:11.070
DEMONSTRATE A REDUCTION IN GHG

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:13.973
EMISSIONS OR DEMONSTRATE THAT IT

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.308
ADDRESSES CLIMATE ADAPTATION

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:17.376
RESILIENCY.

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:19.045
AFFECTS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:22.314
THE PROVISIONS OF A. B..

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:22.948
THREE NINETY EIGHT SO THAT'S THE

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.183
CURRENT VERSION WERE TALKING

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.318
ABOUT NOW WHICH IS A MORE

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:30.823
NARROWLY CRAFTED -- LANGUAGE.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:36.729
THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:37.997
THERE BY.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.665
CENTER OFF.

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.000
THE MANAGER I I SEE THAT THE I

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.068
WAS GOING TO ASK IF WE CAN

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:44.370
EXPECT A FOLLOW UP REPORT ON

00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:45.237
RESULTS.

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:46.739
WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL ATION PLAN

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:48.307
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.442
THE FUND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:50.609
THAT'S DELIVERED TO THE

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:51.877
LEGISLATURE WILL INCLUDE SOME

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.946
INFORMATION ABOUT EXPENDITURES

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.114
FOR THE PRIOR YEAR.

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:56.715
DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THIS FUND

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.084
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WILL

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.918
ACTUALLY.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:01.654
OUTLINED A PLAN OF ACTION BEYOND

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.988
ONE YEAR AT A TIME AND HAVE A

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.657
TARGET DATE.

00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:08.160
AT WHICH POINT WE EXPECT THESE.

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.896
SICK WATER SYSTEMS TO BE. TO BE

00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:11.997
WELL.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:15.134
ANOTHER WAS A GET WELL DAY.

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:16.202
I'M I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT IF

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:17.536
THERE'S SOME PROGRAM IS TO SOME

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:19.171
PLANNED.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.906
PLAN OF ACTION HERE WE JUST

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:21.107
GOING.

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.475
TO SPEND MONEY IN.

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.910
SO AS PART OF THE REQUIREMENT OF

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:26.712
THE PLAN IS TAT THEY OF THE TO

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.315
ANNUALLY AND EVERY SINGLE YEAR --

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:30.549
IDENTIFY THE PRIOR YEAR'S

00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:31.984
VENTURES AND EVERYTHING WILL

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:33.486
YEAR IDENTIFY THE PLANT LEVEL

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:35.621
EXPENDITURES HOWEVER AS PART OF

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.690
THAT THERE'S ALSO -- DATA

00:12:37.756 --> 00:12:39.258
COMPONENT THAT NEED TO BE

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:41.961
INTEGRATED TO IDENTIFY WATER

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.863
THOUGH THERE'S SYSTEMS THAT ARE

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.398
EITHER ALREADY FEELING OR ARE AT

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:48.300
SIGNIFICANT RISK OF FAILING AND

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:49.535
THEN AS PART OF THE PLAN IS

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.004
IDENTIFYING THE SOLUTIONS TO THE

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.005
REMEDY.

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.607
THOSE ISSUES ONGOING RIGHT I

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:55.941
CERTAINLY WOULD EXPECT SOMEBODY

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.943
TO DO SOME THINKING HERE AND

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.746
FIGURE OUT THE WE HAVE TWO

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:01.480
HUNDRED FORTY FIVE OF WATER

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:02.982
SYSTEMS THAT ARE SICK.

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:04.583
AND IT'S GOING TO COST US TWO

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.652
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN AT

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:07.319
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION A

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:09.688
YEAR IT WILL TAKE US.

00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:12.324
NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS TO FIX THIS

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:12.992
PROBLEM.

00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:15.794
IT'S ASSUMING IT'S FIXABLE.

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:16.962
AT SOME POINT TIME.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:18.330
AND THEN WE CAN PLAN ON NOT

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:21.033
SPENDING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.036
MILLION DOLLARS. FOR YOUR

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:24.904
ANYMORE RIGHT [inaudible]

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.406
SO.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.141
JUST GO BACK TO THE THE ONE THE

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:29.942
COMPONENT OF THE PLAN IS TO

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:31.310
IDENTIFY THE ANTICIPATED NEED

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.045
FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.680
ARE FAILING OR AT RISK OF

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:36.448
FAILING -- AS SO THAT THAT WOULD

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:37.683
PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.419
LONGER TERM LOOK -- TO SEE WHAT

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:41.754
THE WORLD IF YOU HAVE THE THREE

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.355
UNDER FAILING SYSTEMS CURRENTLY

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:45.991
IN PLACE WHAT IS THAT LEVEL THE

HUNDRED COMMUNITIES ARE WATER

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.011
DISTRICTS -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:42.181

WELL SYSTEMS THE BECOME STRESSED

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.561
IN LEACH MORE CONTAMINANTS AS A

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:57.062
RESULT OF DROUGHT IS THAT AN

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:59.064
ACCURATE STATEMENT.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:01.166

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.906
IT DOESN'T ADD RESULT IN ADVERSE

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.708
IMPACTS TO WATER AVAILABILITY

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:12.645
AND WATER QUALITY -- AND BOTH AS

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:15.547

AND ALSO ON THE OPPOSITE

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:19.985
SPECTRUM -- MORE HEAVIER

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:22.054
RAINFALL WHICH COULD ALSO RESULT

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.323
AND GREATER FLOODING AND SO WHEN

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.025
IT COMES TO TO DROUGHT WHEN

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.459
THERE'S A INCREASED TEMPERATURE

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.962
AND THERE'S LOWER PRECIPITATION

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:30.729
IT COULD RESULT IN AN LONGER

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.798
PERIODS OF DROUGHT -- WHICH

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:33.832

CONTAMINANTS WITHIN THE CURRENT

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:40.706
WATER SOURCES AND AND MUCH OF IT

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.241
ALSO IS NATURALLY OCCURRING

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:44.009
CONTAMINANTS WHERE YOU JUST HAVE

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:46.278
LESS AMOUNT OF WATER TO DILUTE.

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:47.513
THE CONTAMINATED DURING THE

MANY CASES ARE CONTAMINATED.

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.589
ON THE OPPOSITE SPECTRUM WITH

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.958
THE FLOODING -- AS WE'VE SEEN

00:16:00.025 --> 00:16:00.726

CONTAMINATION FROM THE SURFACE

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:13.205
TO THE THAT DRINKING WATER AND

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:15.140

CLIMATE CHANGE AND CHANGING AND

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:18.243
TEMPERATURES AND CHANGING AND

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.212

A COUPLE OF OTHER KEY ITEMS IN

THIS BILL FIRST IS THE EXPANSION

POVERTY LEVEL THERE COUPLE OF

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.529
HISTORICAL REASONS WHY THAT

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:26.231
WASN'T THE CASE BEFORE.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.933

NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT

FUNDING THEY RIGHT NOW HAVE A

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:42.214
VERY HEALTHY RESERVE -- SO THEY

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:42.981
WOULD NOT RECEIVE THAT FUNDING

00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:44.516
UNTIL THEY GO DOWN TO A TWO YEAR

00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:46.351
RESERVE LEVELS AT WHICH POINT

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:47.953
THE EXISTING A SPLIT WOULD

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:48.854
CONTINUE IN TERMS OF FREE

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.621
DIRECTION.

00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:50.789
SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN ITEMS AND

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:54.593
HAPPY TO TAKEN QUESTIONS

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:57.128

IT'S PENSION SWEEP FUNDED BY THE

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:03.702
MULTI.

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:05.770
I'M INSURANCE MANDATE SECRETARY

00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:07.439
OF THIS IS FOR WHICH PROVISION.

00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:08.073
JUST FOR THE FOR THIS PARTICULAR

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:09.841
EVENT.

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:11.276
SO THE WAY THE ADMINISTRATION

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:12.143
HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT IS

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.945
THAT THE PENALTY REVENUE WOULD

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.914
BE USED FOR THE SUBSIDIES FOR

00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:17.782
COVERED CALIFORNIA AND THAT WAS

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:19.351
ACTUALLY IN THE OTHER HEALTHCARE

00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:21.019
OMNIBUS BILL -- BUT WE PASSED

I SUPPORTIVE OF OF THE MAIL --

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:34.266
AND I THINK THAT THE BILL FAILS

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:37.068
TO ADDRESS SOME KEY ISSUES.

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:39.738
AT THE SAME TIME -- SOME OF US

00:25:39.804 --> 00:25:43.074
AGREE AND TRULY BELIEVE THAT

00:25:43.141 --> 00:25:45.343
HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT --

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.178
BUT I THINK WE MISSED AN

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.480
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE.

00:25:48.546 --> 00:25:51.016
A BASIC FAIRNESS BY NOT

00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:52.717

00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:16.074
REASONS.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:18.510
SENIORS ARE FORCED TO CONTINUE

THIRTY THOUSAND IN CALIFORNIA --

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:51.309

00:27:12.197 --> 00:27:15.867
WITHOUT ANY DISCRIMINATION --

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:18.636
OUR SENIORS CAN'T AFFORD MORE

00:27:18.703 --> 00:27:22.107
DELAYS FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:25.043
EVERY DAY -- EVERY DAY WE WAIT

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.412
MEANS MORE EXPENSE OF EMERGENCY

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:29.981
ROOM VISITS ESPECIALLY AS

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:32.550
SENIORS -- AND SHORTER LIVES FOR

00:27:32.617 --> 00:27:33.918
THE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE THEIR

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:36.388
DIGNITY IN THEIR OLD AGE OLDER

00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:37.622
AGE [inaudible]

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:41.593
OF I SEE THAT THAT THE CREATION

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:43.495
FOR ME THE CREATION OF A TASK

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:45.730
FORCE OR THE RENAMING OF A TASK

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:46.464
FORCE.

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:48.666
IS WERE PUTTING OFF THIS ISSUE

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:50.101
AND WE'RE PUTTING IT OFF FOR

00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:53.438
YEARS TO COME -- I KNOW THAT

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:55.306
THERE'S A A DAY TO BY JULY FIRST

00:27:55.373 --> 00:27:58.176
OF NEXT YEAR BY WHICH A REPORT

00:27:58.243 --> 00:27:58.810
IS EXPECTED.

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:01.913
BUT THAT'S AFTER THE BUDGET IS

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.183
APPROVED -- AND WHO KNOWS WHAT

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.551
WILL COMMENT INTO THAT REPORT.

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:08.420
SO THE WAY I SEE IT IS HERE'S A

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:10.321
COMMISSION THAT WE'VE ASKED TO

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:12.857
LOOK INTO THIS BUT THIS BODY HAS

00:28:12.924 --> 00:28:16.961
APPROVED IT -- AND THE

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:18.863
ADMINISTRATION AND YOU KNOW

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.031
WHEREVER HOWEVER THE DECISION IS

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:21.900
MADE TO PUT IT OFF INTO A

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:23.234
COMMISSION WHICH IS KICKING IT

00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:25.036
DOWN THE ROAD FOR SEVERAL MORE

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:26.438
YEARS.

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:27.872
THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S A A

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:31.843
BUREAUCRATIC -- YOU KNOW TOOL TO

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:32.911
PUT THINGS OFF.

00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:34.946
BUT TO PUT THIS OFF FOR SENIORS

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:38.049
WHO NEED THIS HEALTH CARE NOW IS

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:41.219
UNCONSCIONABLE -- I I JUST -- I

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:42.787
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE

00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:45.957
COULDN'T COVER FORTY THOUSAND

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:47.959
MORE INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:50.862
THAT IS SO WEALTHY WE TALK ABOUT

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:52.430
HOW WEALTHY WE ARE HELP.

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:54.466
OUR ECONOMY IS THE FIFTH BEST IN

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:56.167
THE WORLD AND WE COULDN'T

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:58.870
INCLUDE FORTY THOUSAND SENIORS

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:02.107
WHO NEED THAT COVERAGE NOW.

00:29:02.173 --> 00:29:02.974
WE TREAT ALL CALIFORNIANS THE

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.310
SAME WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER LIFE

00:29:05.376 --> 00:29:07.245
AND DEATH THERE'S NO EXCLUSION

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:08.746
ONE FIRST RESPONDERS GO TO A

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:10.949
FIRE GO TO EMERGENCY THEY DON'T

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:13.017
SAY LET ME SEE YOUR DOCUMENTS

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.253
BEFORE I RESPOND BEFORE I TAKE

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.054
CARE OF YOU.

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:17.322
WE DON'T DO THAT WHEN IT COMES

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:18.923
TO CLEAN WATER.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.592
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT.

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:22.760
AND I'M SURE THEN IN THOSE LOW

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:24.529
INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:26.331
THERE ARE A LOT OF UNDOCUMENTED.

00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:27.332
WE DON'T DO THAT WE DON'T

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:30.635
EXCLUDE THE MOST LABOR LAWS --

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:32.604
SAFETY ON THE JOB WE DON'T

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.406
EXCLUDE AND SAY SHOW ME YOUR

00:29:35.473 --> 00:29:36.641
PAPERS BEFORE WILL.

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:38.243
AND FORCE THOSE LAWS AND THOSE

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.612
RULES AND WHY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:42.780
MAKE SENSE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:44.149
TO EXCLUDE.

00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:46.417
BASED ON WHETHER YOU DOCUMENTED

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:48.486
OR NOT WE LIVE TOGETHER WE GO TO

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:50.722
SCHOOL TOGETHER WE WORK TOGETHER

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:52.624
WE GO TO CHURCH TOGETHER OUR

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.626
KIDS GO TO SCHOOL IN THE SAME

00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:55.627
SCHOOLS.

00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:57.896
AND BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE WE ALL

00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:00.932
BENEFIT FROM THE INCLUSION THEIR

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:02.800
INTEGRATED THEY'RE PART OF OUR

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:05.069
COMMUNITIES AND TO SEGREGATE

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:07.272
THEM OUT SOME WAY THINKING THAT

00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:08.940
WE'RE BETTER OFF BY DOING THAT.

00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:11.676
JUST MAKES ZERO ECONOMIC SENSE

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:14.145
SO I'M DEEPLY DISTURBED BY

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:16.114
PUTTING THE SOFT KICKING THE CAN

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:18.349
DOWN THE ROAD AND NOT THINKING

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:21.786
ABOUT THOSE SENIORS A WHAT THEY

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:22.921
NEED TODAY THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:24.355
THAT CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE.

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:27.125
IT'S JUST ONE VERY VERY SMALL

00:30:27.192 --> 00:30:27.992
PIECE.

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:30.028
IN THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:32.363
THE STATE SO.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.866
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPRESS

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:40.138
MY DISBELIEF AN YOU KNOW ANGER

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:41.773
ANY MOTION AT THEM BEING

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:46.477
EXCLUDED -- THROUGH THIS BILL

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:46.778
[inaudible]

00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:50.515
SELECT RESPOND.

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:51.616
HOW TO SAVE WE DEFINITELY HERE

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:53.484
HERE THAT CONCERNED -- WE SHARE

00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:54.852
THE GOVERNOR'S EXPRESSED HIS

00:30:54.919 --> 00:30:56.221
BELIEF THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:57.655
MOVE TO A STAGE WHERE EVERY

00:30:57.722 --> 00:30:59.157
PERSON IN THE STATE IS COVERED.

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:00.892
AND SO THIS TRAILER BILL DOES

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:03.795
SOME OF THAT IN MOVING FROM ASIA

00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:04.429
NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX BUT THERE

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:05.964
IS CERTAINLY A WAY TO GO TO

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.366
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL [inaudible]

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:10.868
THIRTY PAN.

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:14.339
I THANK YOU -- FIRST OF ALL I DO

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:16.040

MAKING STEPS WE ARE MAKING TODAY --

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.913
TO TRY TO WORK TOWARD -- THE

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.548

SOME MARKERS OUT THERE -- WE

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:34.125
HAVE A GROUP THAT'S GONNA STUDY

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:36.661
IT -- NOT AS FAR AS I THINK WE

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.029
WILL LIKE TO WE IN THE SENATE

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:40.832

AGE TWENTY FIVE ALTHOUGH I THINK.

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.745
I WANTED ISSUES THAT WE'VE ALSO

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:55.313
SAID HERE IN THE SENATE IN

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.614
ADDITION TO THE SENIORS IS THAT

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:58.249
WE WANT PEOPLE FALLING OFF OF

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:00.151
COVERAGE SO WELL WE CERTAINLY

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:02.086

THE SENIORS AS WELL -- BUT I

00:32:21.172 --> 00:32:21.673
THINK IT ALSO COVERS SOME

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:23.908
IMPORTANT GAPS TO INCLUDING --

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:26.644

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:29.113
GAP ANDS AND ALSO -- INCREASING

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.381
THE ELIGIBILITY FOR PREGNANT

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:34.252
WOMEN AS WELL SO -- I WOULD --

CERTAINLY IS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:44.629
SOMEONE AS A LARGE RESERVE BUT

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.130
ALSO WANTED THE ADDED TO KEEP IN

00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:48.766
MIND THAT WE NEED. TO BE SURE

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.902
THOSE PROGRAMS -- DON'T ACTUALLY

00:32:50.968 --> 00:32:52.537
FAIL IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE

00:32:52.603 --> 00:32:53.805
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE GONNA DRAW

00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.006
DOUBTS ARE RESERVISTS THAT.

00:32:55.073 --> 00:33:01.279
THAT'S A POINT WE HAVE TO PICK

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:03.748

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:10.588
VARIOUS COVERAGE PROGRAMS BUT WE

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:11.222
ALSO KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY DUE

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:12.757
TO THE PUBLIC CHARGE -- PEOPLE

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:13.624
MAY BE AFRAID SIGN UP WE NEED TO

00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:14.859
GIVE THEM SOME ALTERNATIVES AS

WELL SO.

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:21.899
WE HAVE TO THINK THAT WE MAY

NEED MULTIPLICITY HAVE DIFFERENT

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:25.570
APPROACHES -- ACCESS POINTS FOR

00:33:25.636 --> 00:33:26.804
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE

00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.873
CARE THEY NEED AND SO IT'S ONE

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.575
OF THE MARKER THERE ON THAT SO

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:31.943
THAT WE KNOW IN THE FUTURE OF

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:33.478
THAT ONCE WE USE THOSE RESERVES

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:34.512
WE DO NEED HELP SUPPORT THE

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:36.247
COUNTIES TO HAVE THESE PROGRAMS

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:36.547
TO BE SURE.

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:37.482
WE CONTINUE THIS PROGRAMS WHEN

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:38.950
ALL THIS PROGRAMS FAIL AND SAID

DECIDED. TO DOWNTOWN SPEND

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:44.322
RESERVE SO WITH THAT I WOULD

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:46.224
CERTAINLY LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:46.791
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP BEFORE WE

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:50.328
HEAR FROM SENATOR SKINNER -- AND

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:51.529
THEN FALL BY CENTER LEYVA QUICK

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:52.630
QUESTION I'M LOOKING AT THE

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:53.464
NEWLY MINTED LANGUAGE

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:56.300
INTERSECTION TO THAT DEFINES THE

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:59.704
APPOINTEES OF THE NEW COMMISSION.

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:04.942
AND I SEE REFERENCE TOOL

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:07.979
COMMITTEE -- OF POTENTIAL

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:10.047
ADVISORS BUT THE GOVERNOR GETS

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:10.648
EIGHT APPOINTMENTS I THINK THE

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.150
SENATE GETS TO THE RULES

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:14.085
COMMITTEE GETS -- TO AND I'M

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:16.154
HOPING THAT IN CONSIDERATION OF

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:20.191
THOSE APPOINTEES THAT -- IMPACT

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:21.225
THE COMMUNITIES WILL ALSO BE

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:24.162
CONSIDERED I HOPE THAT THAT THAT

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:25.663
ISN'T THE EXPECTATION OF THE

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.232
ADVISORY KIND OF ARM BUT THE

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:30.468
ACTUAL VOTING COMMISSIONERS.

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:32.136
ON THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER AMONG

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:35.206
THOSE A THE POINTY APPOINTEES --

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:38.910
IMPACT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:42.947
EITHER -- FOLKS WHO RUN CLINICS

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:44.882
BUT IMPACT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.083
IT WILL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT JUST

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.719
MY LITTLE SUGGESTIONS THANK YOU.

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:49.387
SENATOR SKINNER FOLLOWED BY

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:55.960
LEYVA.

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:57.862
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- JUST

00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:00.331
FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR COMMENTS --

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:06.103
WE IF FOR ME ANYWAY OUT IT HAD

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.005
PREFERENCE FOR THERE TO BE A

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:09.440
LITTLE MORE BALANCE BETWEEN THE

00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:11.509
LEGISLATIVE APPOINTMENTS AND THE

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:14.045
GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENTS JUST --

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:15.847
TOM CLEARLY THIS IS A VERY

00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:17.348
IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THE

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:20.585
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:23.087
WORKING ON VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:25.289
GET UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE FOR

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:25.490
SOME.

00:35:25.556 --> 00:35:27.358
TIME NOW SOME OF WHICH BEEN

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:31.496
SUCCESSFUL SOME OF WHICH NOT --

00:35:31.562 --> 00:35:33.498
FIVE BUT I REALIZE THE BILL IS

00:35:33.564 --> 00:35:35.666
AS DESCRIBED NOW I HOPE THAT WE

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:37.301
WOULD LOOK IN THE FUTURE FOR

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.736
HELP PERHAPS SUGGESTING THOSE

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:40.505
APPOINTMENTS TO ADDRESS BOTH THE

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:42.006
CHEERS CONCERNS TO MAKE SURE

00:35:42.073 --> 00:35:43.140
THAT IMPACTED COMMUNITIES

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:44.942
REPRESENTED BUT ALSO THERE MIGHT

00:35:45.009 --> 00:35:46.677
BE MORE LEGISLATIVE BALANCE.

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:47.545
BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:48.846
BILL TODAY BUT I WANTED ALSO

00:35:48.913 --> 00:35:53.618
FOLLOW UP FOLLOW UP ON MY

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:55.386
COLLEAGUES COMMENT SENATOR DRAWS

00:35:55.453 --> 00:36:00.691
WAS AROUND -- THIS ISSUE OF THE

00:36:00.758 --> 00:36:02.026
THIRTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS OF

00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:03.361
CALIFORNIA WHO.

00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:04.829
ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE BILL AND

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:06.497
WHO THE SENATE WANTED TO HAVE

00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:08.466
INCLUDED.

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:10.134
AND I THINK THAT IS WORTH IT FOR

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:11.736
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DO

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:12.737
SOME.

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:16.107
ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE COST IS OF

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:18.676
THIS EXCLUSION WELL WE FULL WELL

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:20.645
KNOW WHAT THE COST IS OF

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:22.580
INCLUDING BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:23.881
IT.

00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:26.984
COSTS FOR MEDI CAL -- FOR OF

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:27.985
CERTAIN AGE.

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:29.854
I THINK THAT.

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:32.924
THE COST FOR THE EXCLUSION COULD

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.392
BE QUIZ TYPE NOT HIGHER.

00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:37.428
PARTLY BECAUSE THESE FOLKS WILL

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:39.397
NOW BE DEPENDENT ON EMERGENCY

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:41.065
ROOM CARE THAT'LL BE THE ONLY

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:43.734
REAL CARE -- AVAILABLE TO THEM

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.136
BUT IN ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A

00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:46.904
OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.773
ANYTIME WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:50.141
NOT COVERED.

00:36:50.207 --> 00:36:51.442
IN DATE THEN.

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:55.012
DELAY BEING TREATED.

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.714
FOR ANY TYPE OF CONDITION.

00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:58.282
THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:00.084
COMMUNICABLE AND THERE COULD BE

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:01.819
ANY NUMBER OF THINGS THERE'S NO

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:04.388
VACCINATIONS FOR MURSI'S STAPH

00:37:04.455 --> 00:37:05.823
INFECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.593
THERE ARE LOTS OF FOUR TWO WELL

00:37:08.659 --> 00:37:09.760
THERE'S VACCINATIONS FOR

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:12.697
TUBERCULOSIS THERE IS -- THERE

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:16.701
IS NOT RIGHT IT'S LIMITED VERY.

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.736
YEAH THIRDS NOT -- AVAILABLE

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:20.905
IT'S LIMITED AND WE SEE WITHIN

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:22.840
OUR LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS AND

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:25.843
A RISE IN TUBERCULOSIS --

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.413
THERE'S LOTS OF CONDITIONS THAT.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.349
WOULD THAT IN FACT THREATEN THE

00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:32.984
PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE REST OF US

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.486
BY ARE NOT COVERING HEALTHCARE

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:36.988
FOR EVERYONE.

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:39.590
ADDITIONALLY WE ALREADY HAVE.

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:41.626
NOT BY ACTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:43.995
GOVERNMENT BUT BY ACTIONS OF THE

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:44.929
WHITE HOUSE.

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:47.665
WE HAVE SO MUCH FEAR IN OUR

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:49.266
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY NOW WE'RE

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:51.869
TALKING FEAR IN MORE THAN JUST

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:53.270
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED.

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:54.739
AS I WAS DRIVING TO THE CAPITAL

00:37:54.805 --> 00:37:56.107
TODAY.

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:58.676
I LISTEN TO REPORT ON A STUDY

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:02.580
DONE BY UC BERKELEY OF CHILDREN.

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:04.115
OF NOTED I ROOM IN CHILDREN

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:06.017
SHOULD SAY SONS AND DAUGHTERS SO

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:07.585
THESE ARE ADULTS.

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:10.021
OF THEIR US CITIZENS BUT THEY

00:38:10.087 --> 00:38:10.921
ARE.

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:12.857
THEIR PARENT IS LIVING WITH THEM

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:15.292
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE A

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.360
PARENT THAT'S UNDOCUMENTED.

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:19.864
THOSE PEOPLE ARE OWN US CITIZENS

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.298
WHAT THE RIVER.

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:23.067
RESEARCH SHOWED THEIR STRESS

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:26.037
LEVELS THEIR ANXIETY LEVELS.

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:28.939
AFFECTING SLEEP AFFECTING MANY

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:30.941
ASPECTS OF THEIR HEALTH OUR WAY

00:38:31.008 --> 00:38:33.377
UP BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR FOR

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:34.445
THEIR FAMILY.

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:36.580
WE KNOW NOW THAT MANY OF OUR

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:38.115
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AGAIN THEY

00:38:38.182 --> 00:38:39.984
MIGHT ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON IN

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:41.519
THEIR FAMILY WHOSE UNDOCUMENTED.

00:38:41.585 --> 00:38:43.487
ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ANY

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:46.657
GOVERNMENT SERVICES FOR THE FEAR.

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:49.794
THAT -- THAT IS BEING THAT IS

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.062
BEEN PROVOKED NOW BY THESE

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:54.632
THREATS FOR IMMIGRATION ACTION.

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:57.301
YOU ARE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO GO

00:38:57.368 --> 00:39:00.004
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IF YOU

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:01.238
HAVE NO HEALTH CARE.

00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:03.641
THEN YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO USE

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:05.409
YOUR MEDI CAL BECAUSE AT LEAST

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:07.011
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:08.713
RECOGNIZED YOU.

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:10.948
AND MADE YOU.

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:13.317
A A LEGAL USER SO YOU MAY HAVE

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:16.487
LESS FEAR ABOUT GOING AND

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:18.155
SEEKING OUT HEALTH CARE WHERE AS

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:20.124
NOW THERE MAY BE EVEN GREATER

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.659
BECAUSE EVEN THE STATE OF

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.694
CALIFORNIA IS NOT IS BASICALLY

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:25.329
NOT RECOGNIZING YOU AND

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:26.564
PROVIDING YOU HEALTH CARE.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.766
SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT TO

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:31.635
MENTION TO OUR CONVERSATION AND

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:33.471
HOPE THAT WE CAN REMEDY IT IN --

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:36.006
THIS UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR THANK

00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:37.041

SENATOR TO RAZA THOSE COMMENTS.

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:48.052
WE ALL WORK HERE AND WE SERVICE

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:49.253
OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.422
CONSTITUENTS THAT ROUTE WE WE

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:53.290
REPRESENT BUT I KNOW WE ALL HAVE

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:55.226

SEVENTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN AND

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:04.935
THEY ARE BOTH.

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:06.570
ALMOST RETIRED THEY CHOOSE THE

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:07.905
WORK BECAUSE THEY WANT.

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:09.707
TO BUT THEY'RE JUST REGULAR

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:11.976
PEOPLE AND WHEN MY MOM SAID TO

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.277
ME TWO WEEKS AGO.

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:15.846
HONEY WHY WOULD THAT HELP IN Y.

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.515
WITH THOSE THE OLDER PEOPLE WHO

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.049
NEED IT THE MOST WHY WOULD THEY

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.818
BE EXCLUDED AND YOU KNOW SHE'S

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:22.486
THINKING OF HERSELF AND SHE'S

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:23.988
THINKING OF MY DAD.

00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:24.655
AS I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:26.323
REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE REAL

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.026
PEOPLE WITH REAL ISSUES.

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:30.294
AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT WHEN I

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:32.363
WAS WITH THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:33.664
IN THE TWENTY YEARS THAT WE

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:34.832
BARGAINED CONTRACTS.

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:37.635
EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT FAIL

00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:40.471
THE CORPORATIONS WANTED TO

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:41.806
ELIMINATE RETIREE HEALTH CARE

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.541
EVERY SINGLE TIME AND WE HAD A

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:45.242
FIGHT SO HARD TO KEEP THAT IN

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:46.610
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:48.312
GIVEN US ALL A GOOD DAYS OF

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:50.381
THEIR LIFE. TO MAKE THE COMPANY

00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:52.550
BETTER FOR CALIFORNIA BETTER SO

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:53.951
I JUST THINK THAT WE OWE THEM

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:55.653
SOMETHING AND I TO FEEL THAT

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.621
HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:58.756
IT'S NOT A PRIVILEGE.

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:00.424
SO I DO HOPE THAT WE WILL LOOK

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:02.726
AT THIS A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY IT

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.795
IS IN A HUGE GROUP -- BUT THE

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:07.097
LONGER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.766
TO CARE THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:13.170
FOR ALL OF US THANK YO THANK

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:13.337

I'M GONNA.

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:19.009
THE VERY BRIEF IN MY COMMENTS

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.711
TALKING ABOUT ISSUES OF THE

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.279
HEALTHY CALIFORNIA COMMISSION.

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:23.080
NUMBER ONE MADAM CHAIR I DO

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:25.349
THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:26.550
RIGHT DIRECTIONS.

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:27.685
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:29.186
THE BOTTOM LINE AND I KNOW THAT.

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:31.255
NOT ALL OF US AGREE THAT'S FINE

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.290
BUT I THINK CALIFORNIANS ONE A

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.592
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IN THE STATE.

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.193
IN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.428
ALWAYS HAD IS BEING ABLE TO

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:38.729
IDENTIFY NUMBER ONE WHAT THOSE

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:40.564
COSTS WILL BE INTO THE

WE HAVE THESE DEADLINES IN

STATUTES WE KNOW WE HAVE TO MEET

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:33.544
THEM AND THE WAY THAT THE

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:34.845
DEADLINES WERE STAGGERED OUT

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:36.213
THERE WAS A PURPOSE BEHIND IT

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.483
WHICH IS THAT THE FIRST DEADLINE --

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:40.117
I KNOW AND I KNOW THIS TAX THEY

00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:40.951
SEEM LIKE THEY SOUND A LITTLE

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:41.552
BIT SIMILAR BUT THE FIRST IN

00:43:41.618 --> 00:43:42.753
LINE IS REALLY FOR AN ANALYSIS

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.121
OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM.

00:43:44.188 --> 00:43:45.689

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.627
CONSIDERATIONS SO WHEN YOU'RE

00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:52.529
IMAGINING WHAT THIS NEW SYSTEM

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:53.564
WILL LOOK LIKE AND SO BETWEEN

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.933
THOSE TWO DEADLINES ABOUT SIX OR

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.334
SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS SO WE

00:43:57.401 --> 00:43:58.202
THINK WOULD THAT TIME LINE

00:43:58.268 --> 00:43:59.670
ALTHOUGH IT IS AMBITIOUS WE WILL

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:00.804
BE ABLE TO DEVELOP SOME

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:02.072
IMPORTANT OPTIONS.

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:03.240
IN ANY OF THIS IS GOING TO GO

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:04.908
WITHOUT SAYING TO BE MY LAST

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.477
POINT MADAM CHAIR IS IF WE'RE IF

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:07.711

GO TO GET US THERE -- AND THAT'S

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:17.287
WHERE I GET WORRIED ABOUT IS

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:19.923
THAT -- AT TIMES THIS IS BEEN

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.791
REALLY SCARY FOR FOLKS TO BE

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:23.327
ABLE TO JUMP OFF INTO A AND

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:23.894
WE'RE GONNA NEED THE RIGHT

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:24.995
PEOPLE THE RIGHT SEATS AND I

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.230
HOPE THAT WE'RE GONNA GET THOSE.

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:28.499
WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF IT -- AND

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:28.999
NOT JUST THROW UP SOME

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:30.467
ADDITIONAL UP SCHOOLS JUST BEING

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:31.235
CANDID ABOUT IT.

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:33.704
BECAUSE RATHER THAN JUST PUT A

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:39.376
WINDOW DRESSING OUT THERE ANY

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:41.412
THOUGHTS ON THAT.

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:42.046
