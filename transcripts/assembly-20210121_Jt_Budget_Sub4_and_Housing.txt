HOMELESSNESS AND REVISIT PAST INVESTMENTS TO HELP GUIDE US FORWARD. IN MY DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WITHIN L. A. COUNTY. LA'S ANNUAL HOMELESS COUNT RELEASED THEIR LAST REPORT IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND STATED THAT ABOUT. SIXTY SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PEOPLE RE NOW LIVING ON THE STREETS AND SHELTERS AND IN THEIR CARS ACROSS THE COUNTY. THIS IS AN INCREASE OF TWELVE POINT 7% SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN. WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF LOS ANGELES ALONE THERE HAVE BEEN THERE HAS BEEN A FOUR POINT TO INCREASE OVER THE LAST YEAR RESULTING IN. FORTY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE% SLICE OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ALONE IS UNPARALLELED. AMID A COVERT NINETEEN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS TOP WAS 20% AT ITS PEAK. FOR REFERENCE L. A. COUNTY POPULATION IS TEN POINT FOUR MILLION THAT MEANS CLOSE TO TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE. WERE UNEMPLOYED AND WORRIED ABOUT HOUSING AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA AT ITS PEAK IN MAY IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS 16% THAT'S ROUGHLY SIX POINT FOR CALIFORNIANS. WITHOUT A JOB WITHOUT MEANS WORRIED AND WONDERING AND FRIGHTENED FOR THEIR FUTURE ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS. ADDING TO ALREADY EXISTING. EXHAUSTED RESOURCES. I BRING THESE NUMBERS U TO SHARE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REAL HUMAN LIVES IMPACTED BY LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. STRUGGLING AMID THE PANDEMIC MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES UNEMPLOYMENT LOOMING EVICTIONS GENTRIFYING NEIGHBORHOODS INCREASING RENTS. AND GENERALLY A LACK OF AFFORDABLE AND LOW INCOME HOUSING. HUMAN BEINGS ARE IMPACTED BY CHRONIC EPISODIC TRANSITIONAL AND HIDDEN HOMELESSNESS AND ALL OF US HERE HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH BEING GOOD STEWARDS OF OUR STATE BUDGET. THE PUBLIC TRUST AND ENSURING BASIC RIGHTS IT IS MY BELIEF. THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS A RIGHT TO HOUSING. AND A RIGHT TO LIVE- COMMITTEE. FOR TODAY'S HEARING WE HAVE THREE PANELS ON THE SUBJECTS OF OVERVIEW OF THE STATE'S ROLE ON HOMELESSNESS LOCAL PERSPECTIVES. AND LASTLY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM EXPERTS. WE PLAN TO HAVE A QUESTION I CAN ANSWER SECTION AFTER EACH PANEL. I LIKE AT THIS MOMENT TO TURN IT OVER TO THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAVID CHIU FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR OPENING REMARKS FOLLOWED BY REMARKS FROM OTHER MEMBERS. MEMBERS PLEASE TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS CONCISE. AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING- OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FOUR FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP ON THIS HEARING. AS WELL AS THE NEW CHAIR BUDGET SUB FOR AND REALLY APPRECIATE HER ONGOING PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO. FIGURE OUT HOW WE AND HOMELESSNESS CARRYING ON THE COMMITMENT OF HER PREDECESSOR MISTER COOPER. AND WANTED JUST THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES FOR BEING PART OF THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. HOMELESSNESS AS I'VE OFTEN SAID IS THE MORAL ISSUE OF OUR TIME IT HAS BEEN. THE VERY TOP ISSUE ON THE MINDS OF MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS GIVEN THE RECORD NUMBERS OF HOMELESSNESS THAT WE SEE ON OUR STREETS. I THINK WE ALL HOPE THAT LAST YEAR TWENTY TWENTY WAS GONNA BE THE YEAR THAT WE TACKLE THIS TOPIC. FOR GOVERNOR DEVOTED HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS TO THIS- BUT OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW WITH THE PANDEMIC WITH THE RECESSION WAS SOCIAL AND REST. THERE WERE MANY OTHER CRISES THAT WE HAVE TO TACKLE THIS PAST YEAR. DESPITE THIS CRISIS THE ADMINISTRATION WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE WORKED HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T SEE EVEN HIGHER SKYROCKETING RATES OF HOMELESSNESS. DURING THIS PANDEMIC. I WANT TO JUST APPRECIATE THE WORK AROUND PROJECT HUNKY ROOM KEY. THE CRITICAL FUNDING THAT WE PUT INTO LAW THIS BUDGET TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. AS WELL AS LEADERSHIP IN THIS HOUSE THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN BILLS. THAT WERE PASSED BY THE ASSEMBLY- THAT UNFORTUNATELY EITHER WERE STALLED OR GOT VETOED. AND I THINK MANY OF US ARE EAGER FOR A COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATION. AND HOW WE TACKLE THIS TOPIC HOW WE FOCUS ATTENTION ON HOMELESSNESS. SHE WAS A MEMBER. THUS FAR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE. A LOT MORE DISCUSSION ON IT- BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO WHAT I PLAN TO BE FOCUSED ON IN THIS HEARING AND MOVING FORWARD. IS HOW WE TALK ABOUT. NOT JUST ADDRESSING AND MANAGING HOMELESSNESS A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS. BUT HOW DO WE AND HOMELESSNESS. ENDING HOMELESSNESS. IS GOING TO REQUIRE. A REAL STATEWIDE COMMITMENT. TO A STRATEGIC PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE. ONGOING RESOURCES NOT JUST ONE TIME RESOURCES. AND REQUIRE REAL ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE PARTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. STATE GOVERNMENTS THE NONPROFIT SECTOR AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN- THOSE ARE THE ISSUES AND I'M HOPING WE WILL TACKLE. THIS YEAR AND STARTING WITH TODAY'S HEARING AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK TO MEASURE. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER MEMBERS THAT WISH TO HAVE ANY REMARKS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND AS THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS IN ORANGE COUNTY. I HAVE READ AND DIGESTED MANY OF THE PROPOSALS BY THE STATE AND HAVE HEARD MANY PROPOSALS ONE OF THE THINGS I'M HOPING TO HEAR IN THIS HEARING. IS HOW DID WE DO WITH THE GOVERNORS OF THE STATE OF THE STATE LAST YEAR WHERE HE- MADE. MAJOR POINTS ON US ACQUIRING STATE LAND AND HOW WE MIGHT USE IT AND LISA. AND BE ABLE TO USE THAT FOR SOME HOUSING I KNOW WITH THE PANDEMIC MANY THINGS WERE PUT. UP ON HOLDER PUSHED BACK SECOND THING THAT I'M GOING TO BE WANTING TO HEAR ABOUT IS I TO SUPPORT THE PROJECT HOME KEY UP AND PROJECT TURN KEY I GET THOSE MIXED UP- BUT I WANT TO BE UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT THE EQUITY. IN THESE PROGRAMS AS FAR AS DOLLARS AN ALLOCATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BECAUSE AS I REPRESENT ORANGE COUNTY- WE TO HAVE A GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION LIKE EVERY OTHER. COUNTY IN THE STATE AND HOW ARE THESE DOLLARS ALLOCATED AND HOW- CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT TO WHEN WE APPLY WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE CHANCE OF ATTAINING FUNDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM THANK YOU MEDICARE PPRECIATED AND- THANK YOU ALSO TO OUR OUR HOUSING CHAIR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES- I AGREE THAT THIS IS A I THINK ONE OF THE MOST PERSISTENT AND CHALLENGING PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I AGREE THAT IT IS A GREAT MORAL CHALLENGE. WHAT I'M HOPING TO HEAR TODAY IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION AND HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT STOPPING PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS ARE CHARLIE TO THE- IDEA THAT THE COUNT BY- BY- THE MOST RECENT TWO THOUSAND NINE HONDA ACCOUNT. AND WHAT I FOUND MOST INTERESTING ABOUT IS THAT ON AVERAGE EVERY DAY IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TWO HUNDRED SEVEN PEOPLE ARE MOVED INTO HOUSING AND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN BECOME NEWLY HOMELESS. SO EVERY DAY ARE HOMELESS PROBLEM IS GROWING IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FIND ADDITIONAL TWENTY PEOPLE HUMAN BEINGS FRIENDS NEIGHBORS PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE'RE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THOSE ON THE STREETS BUT I ALSO THINK IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT WE THINK ABOUT HOW ARE WE PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT PART OF THE EQUATION THAT WE ARE NEVER GOING TO DIG OURSELVES OUT OF THIS HOLE. THE OTHERS ARE VERY EAGER TO HEAR ABOUT AND HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT IS THE ISSUE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING DATA DRIVEN POLICYMAKING. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON. HOW DO WE BRING SOME REAL ACCOUNTABILITY SO WE HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT DOLLARS WE'RE SPENDING ARE ACTUALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON THIS PROBLEM. I WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THAT I'M NOT CONFIDENT THAT THERE ARE FOLKS WHO COULD SWITCH OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS AND WHICH ONES ARE REALLY GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND SO I THINK BRINGING SOME REAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO WHICH OF THESE. INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE WHICH OF THE INVESTMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE- IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I KNOW OUR CHAIR MENTIONED THAT BOTH THOSE- STEWARDS OF THE TAXPAYER RESOURCES. ARAFAT ALSO AS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS COMPASSIONATELY AS POSSIBLE TO HELP FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO BRING THEM OFF THE STREETS I THINK WE NEED. MUCH BETTER DATA ABOUT WHAT PROGRAMS ARE WORKING WHAT INVESTMENTS ARE WORKING AND WHERE WE CAN RETARGET RESOURCES SO THOSE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT I HOPE. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON TODAY AS WE CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU. MR GABRIEL ANYONE ELSE OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE COMMENTS. BEFORE WE BEGIN. SEEING NONE AGAIN THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR BEING HERE AND I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL RECOGNITION TO THE PREVIOUS CHAIRMAN SIR COOPER WAS GUIDED ME THROUGH THIS PROCESS I SAY AS I LEAD MY FIRST HEARING AS WELL AS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU HAD TO STEP OUT FOR A MINUTE- AND WILL BE RETURNING SO LET'S GET STARTED ON ON THE PANEL UP ON THE OVERVIEW OF THE STATE'S ROLE ON HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE LOTUS MORALIS WAS A PRINCIPAL IN FISCAL. POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND SECRETARY LOU THIS GOT TO CONSTRUCT A METIS- FOR BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY- MISS MORALIS WHY DON'T WE START WITH YOU. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. GOOD MORNING THIS MARVELOUS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AT THE PLEASURE TO BE WITH- THE CHAIRS IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS MORNING. I WILL BEGIN MY COMMENTS FROM MY HAND OUT TO GIVE ME A MOMENT I'LL JUST BE SHARING MY SCREEN SO. YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG. I BELIEVE YOU ARE SEEN MY SCREEN NOW. YES WE CAN SEE IT THANK YOU. BY STAFF TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR THE DISCUSSION WILL BE TAKING PLACE TODAY SO I WANT TO BEGIN BY PROVIDING SOME BACKGROUND ON HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT ALL TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE TODAY I'M IN CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS SPEND MORE ON HOUSING AND HOUSEHOLD IN THE REST OF THE NATION AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR HOUSEHOLDS IN THE LOWEST INCOME- FOR THESE HOUSEHOLDS. PARTICULARLY THE OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO SPEND MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT FACE DIRE CONSEQUENCES AND ARE AT HIGHEST RISK OF HOUSING INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS. IN ADDITION WE KNOW THAT THE NEED FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING ASSISTANCE OUTSTRIPS THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES AT THIS TIME. OUR OFFICE HAS ESTIMATED THAT THE STATE WOULD BE TO PROVIDE TEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME RENTERS PAY NO MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOME. ON RENT A MONTH BETWEEN NO CERTAIN THE THRESHOLD TO DISTINGUISH IT SHOULD BE A RENT BURDEN. AND SO WITH THAT IN MY ABILITY TO TURN TO TAKE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION. BEFORE I DO I WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE CONTEXT INTO THE DATA CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE HERE. THE STATE HAS HISTORICALLY RELIED ON THE POINT IN TIME COUNTS WHICH ON. MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT NOTED IN THEIR OPENING COMMENTS HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH THE WAY THAT DATA IS COLLECTED AND LIKELY REPRESENTED. UNDER COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE. AND THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS CREATED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WITH THE DATA COLLECTION THE TWENTY TWENTY DATA IS NOT YET AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR CHALLENGES WITH THE UNSHELTERED COUNT THAT- YOU KNOW IT WOULD GENERALLY TAKE PLACE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR- BUT A LOT OF UPON A POINT OF AN OPTIMISM IS THE NEW DATA SYSTEM THAT THE STATE IS SETTING UP THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM. WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE OPERATIONAL IN THE SPRING AND WOULD BRING TOGETHER SOME STANDARDIZED DATA. FROM THE CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT THAT- PROVIDE SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I'M AND WELL THEY'RE NOT A REPLACEMENT OF THE POINT IN TIME COUNT THE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION AND COULD BE A VALUABLE. TO- MOVING FORWARD. AND SO WHAT BETTER MIND THE NAY. COULD OF PAGES HIGHLIGHT. TWENTY NINETEEN DATA. AT THE TIME- THE DATA FOUND THAT THERE IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND. PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THIS IS THE LARGEST AMOUNT. IN ANY STATE IN THE NATION. 72% OF THAT POPULATION. WHAT'S AND SHELTERED. AND AT THIS NEXT FIGURE DEPICTS THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE IS IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA. STILL HISTORICALLY THE STATE'S ROLE WE HAVE PLAYED A NUMBER OF ROLES IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS FROM PROVIDING FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE BUILDING OF NEW AFFORDABLY PRICED HOW ON HOUSING. ENSURING THAT HOUSEHOLDS CAN IN FACT AFFORD HOUSING AND ALSO ARE PUTTING A NUMBER OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT MAY ASSIST IN THE PREVENTION OR IN THE OVERCOMING OF HOMELESSNESS. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN OPERATED OUT OF A NUMBER OF STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. SOME OF THE MOST NOTABLE ARE EACH CD AT THE STATE AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY TAX IDENTIFICATION COMMITTEE AND THE HOMELESS COORDINATING FINANCE COUNCIL AS WELL AS THE VERY MANY ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES. THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF FUNDING SOURCES- THAT THAT COME TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING. OVERALL THE FUNDING HAS FLOWN TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE HAD A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY USE THE VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES TO DELIVER HOMELESSNESS SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE. FOR THEM. HOWEVER IN RECENT YEARS AS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IS BECOME MORE ACUTE THE STATE HAS TAKEN A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN FUNDING PROGRAMS AND SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE TABLE THAT'S ON YOUR SCREEN NOW JUST PROVIDES HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS SHE HAS MADE IN RECENT YEARS. THE FOR CHO SAID- THERE WAS THE KEEPING HALF PROGRAMS WHICH TOGETHER PROVIDED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OPERATED OUT OF. THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL UNTIL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THEN THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS WAS MENTIONED IN THE OPENING COMMENT THAT HAVE. YOU INTENDED TO RESPOND TO COPE AT NINETEEN. SO THE NEXT PAGES OF MY HAND OUT PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS OUTLINED IN THE TABLE. I WANTED TO MUCH DETAIL ON THE SPECIFICS HERE- OVERALL SERVICE WAS THE FIRST MAJOR NEW INVESTMENT IN IN THIS ERA ERA FOR HOMELESSNESS WHICH PROVIDED FLEXIBLE FUNDING TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADDRESS THEIR HOMELESSNESS NEED- THIS IS THE PROGRAM THAT HAS FULLY DISBURSED THE FUNDING TO QUALIFYING CITIES AND COCS. AND THE FUNDS MUST BE EXPENDED BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR SO THIS WILL BE SORT OF THE FIRST PROGRAM WHERE WE DO START TO GET REAL DATA ABOUT NOT ONLY HOW THE FUNDS HAD BEEN USED BUT WHAT ARE THE KEY OUTCOMES. FOR THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT I WALK THROUGH AND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THE FUNDS BE FULLY EXPENDED YET AND SO DATA THERE IS MORE ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE ARE SPEND RATHER THAN TO. CHIU OUTCOME. EATERS SO AGAIN ON THIS PAGE SORT OF THE LEFT THE PROGRAMS NOTE IT HAS PROVIDE SIX AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO. THE LARGEST CITIES COUNTIES AND CSCS. HERE ONE OF THE FOCUS OF THE PROGRAMMES WAS TO DEVELOP MORE REGIONAL COORDINATION. I'M SO THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE TO WORKING COLLABORATIVELY. TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THEIR BROADER REGION RATHER THAN YOU A- MANNER. AS I MENTIONED THE STATE DID HAVE TO HAVE IT WITH THE EMERGENCE OF CODE IN NINETEEN. TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND HEALTH RISKS FACED BY INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE INITIAL RESPONSE FROM THE STATE WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROJECT ROOM KEY WITH A LOCK FOR THE LEAST SEEN OF HOTELS AND MOTELS ANOTHER OTHER PROPERTIES. TO ENSURE THAT HOMES OPERATIONS HAD A SAFE PLACE TO SHELTER DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS FUNDING- HAS BEEN EXPANDED. OVERALL AT THIS POINT THERE ARE OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND ROOMS THAT HAVE BEEN SECURED AND CURRENTLY. OCCUPANCY IS ABOUT 70% OVERALL ABOUT TWO THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SERVED ACROSS FORTY TWO COUNTIES IN THE STATE FROM THE ROOM KEY PROGRAM. THERE'S ALSO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED EMERGENCY HOMELESSNESS FUNDING- THIS WAS TO PROVIDE SORT OF MORE FLEXIBLE FUNDING TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO HELP ADDRESS. THE NEEDS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION ONCE AGAIN DURING DURING CO THAT AND THIS FUNDING HAS ALSO BEEN DISTRIBUTED. AND SHOULD BE EXPECTED BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. THANK YOU SORT-OF WANT ONE OF THE MAJOR NEW FEATURES OF. THIS NEW ERA WE'RE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE PURCHASE SEEN- AND RESTORATION OF. HOMES TO ENSURE UNITS EXCUSE ME TO ENSURE THAT AND THERE'S MORE PERMANENT HOUSING. FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HOMELESS. THIS FUNDING HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED AS WELL THERE'S BEEN NINETY FOUR AWARDS NEED TO LOCAL ENTITIES AND THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES ACOSTA RESULT IN ABOUT SIX THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AND LASTLY THERE IS A CONTINUATION OF THE HOT PROGRAM WHICH WHICH I MENTIONED WAS A ONE TIME PROGRAM- FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN- TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A REGIONAL COLLABORATION THIS FUNDING HAS NOT YET BEEN AWARDED APPLICATION FOR DO YOU AT THE END OF. THE MONTH AND LIKE THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM THIS FUNDING WOULD GO TO THE LARGEST CITIES COUNTIES AND COULD. CARE. THAT'S A- QUICK OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE MAJOR FUNDING. OF THE LAST FEW YEARS- AFTER THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE- LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAS DEDICATED- ON EXTREME CONCERN AND INTEREST IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE- BUT TO DATE THE FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED HAS BEEN ON A ONE TIME TEACHER. AND SO CAN WHILE THE STATE HAD TO ACT QUICKLY TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF COOK AT NINETEEN. THE SCALE OF HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN THE STATE IS SIGNIFICANT AND WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL COORDINATION EVEN LARGE RESOURCES CAN BE DISTRIBUTED WITHOUT MUCH PROGRESS AND SO WHAT'S ON. THE FINAL TWO PAGES OF MY HAND OUT OUTLINED ARE SOME QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER THE LARGEST YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WHICH CHOOSES TO MOVE FORWARD. TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS IN FACT A STREET TO STRATEGIC PLAN TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE FACETS OF HOMELESSNESS AND TO ENSURE THAT IT. IS ADDRESSED. PERMANENTLY TENSION THAT THERE'S A CLEAR GOALS TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO GOLD ABOUT THE PREVENTION ENTERED AND THE RESPONSE AS WELL. AND THAT THE SOLUTIONS ADDRESSED ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS BUT THERE ARE CLEAR RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE STATE- TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THE FUNDING STRUCTURE ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS PROGRAMS AND THEIR IMPACT ON ON GOING NEEDS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE AN ONGOING REVENUE SOURCE IDENTIFIED- AND THAT THERE IS A RIGOROUS OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY AND- RE ADJUSTS TO A FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM IF. THERE ARE- SHORTCOMINGS IDENTIFIED. THAT HIGHLIGHTS- LIMINE. OF THE PROGRAM ALL STOPS MY. AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A OF YOUR AT THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MORALIS WILL TAKING QUESTIONS FOLLOWING THAT SECOND PANELIST UP ON THIS PANEL. THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU. GREAT OKAY WE ARE NOW GOING TO INTRODUCED US SECRETARY CASTRO TREMENDOUS IS MORNING- THIS IS SECRETARY CUSTER TO MEET IS. GOOD MORNING SECRETARY WE CAN HEAR YOU YOU MAY BEGIN YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED I'M OVER THIS CUSTOMER JOURNEY IT IS TONIGHT THAT'S THE SECRETARY OF CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH- SHARE CUDDLY YELL AND SHARE TO I IN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT THE STATE'S INCREASED LEADERSHIP AND OUR EFFORTS. TO DEVELOP A COHESIVE OUR SYSTEM AND A SET OF SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS. AND LET ME ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR FOCUS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP I AM FOR THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES THAT HAPPENED A DEDICATED- TO COMPREHENSIVELY. ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS ACROSS OUR STATE. D. THAT I'M A- FOR. AND THE C. S. H. OR THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING HOUSING ACROSS THE CONTINUUM FROM HOMELESSNESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND TODAY I WILL FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THAT THE TWO PRIMARY ENTITIES WITH AN AGENCY THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HOMELESSNESS POLICY HOMELESSNESS- FINDING- IN COORDINATION WITH LOCAL ENTITIES. AND THOSE TWO. ENTITIES ARE THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. I JUST BRIEFLY ON THE HOMELESS OF COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL IT WAS CREATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY STATE LAW. THE COUNCIL IS ENTRUSTED TO IMPLEMENT AND COORDINATE HOUSING FIRST POLICIES GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS. THE COUNCIL- CONSISTS OF NINETEEN MEMBERS OF ONE MEMBER ISAPPOINTED BY THE STATE SENATE. RULES COMMITTEE AND ONE MEMBER BY THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT HOMELESSNESS IS SOLVABLE I BET IT REQUIRES AS MENTIONED EARLIER FOCUSED COORDINATION ACROSS THE STATE SYSTEMS GOOD DATA TO INFORM AND MEASURE OUR PROGRESS STRONGER STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS AND INVESTMENT IN INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES. AND OUR EFFORT ALSO MUST BE GROUNDED IN THE DRESSING THE RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT EXIST WITHIN THE SYSTEM. LIKE AMERICANS AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AT A HIGHER RATE THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO STANDING HISTORICAL AND STRUCTURAL RACISM AND COBIT NINETEEN IN MANY CASES HAS EXACERBATED THESE INEQUITIES. HANDS AS WE MOVE TOGETHER WE MUST ACT WITH THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY TO ADVANCE MULTI PRONGED IN MULTIYEAR SOLUTIONS TO MEET PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS TO INCREASE SHELTERING AND PERMANENT HOUSING OPTIONS AND ALSO TO PREVENT INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS. IN RECENT YEARS OUR AGENCY HAS BEEN PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF HISTORIC LEVELS OF FUNDING TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS OUTLINED BY AT THE LEGISLATIVE. ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I NOTICE MORALIS. HEDT FOR EXAMPLE HAS AWARDED. OVER ONE POINT ONE BILION UNDER THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. ALSO SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN NEARLY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND HOMELESS CONTINUUM OF CARE THROUGH THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM AND THE HOMELESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM. THE FLEXIBLE USE OF THESE FUNDS HAS BEEN CRITICAL TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. ALSO WITHIN THE STRUCTURE THERE IS A SET ASIDE FOR A YOUTH- AND- DOUBLE THROUGH THROUGH THE HEAP AND HAVE PROGRAM AND HAVING TO SET ASIDE HAS ENABLED COMMUNITIES TO TARGET AT STRATEGIES. FOR SERVING- HOMELESS YOUTH. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN AN INCREASE IN REGIONAL COORDINATION AND PLANNING DUE TO THESE ADVANCEMENTS. BUT IN THE PROCESS OF ADMINISTERING THE SPONSOR WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE GOOD DATA TO MEASURE OUR IMPACT. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS EMBARKED IN THE DESIGN OF A ROBUST DATA SYSTEM TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AT B. C. S. H. BEGAN BUILDINGTHE STATE'S FIRST EVER UNIFIED HOMELESS DATA WAREHOUSE. THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM AS WE CALL IT. WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO ACCESS AND COMPILED. FROM AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S FORTY FOR CONTINUANCE OF CARE FOR CLC'S. ALL FORTY FOUR COCS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE EXECUTED DE THAT USED IT REMAINS WITH B. C. S. H. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP IN FOR THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE STATE LED EFFORT. WITH CONSISTENT AND STANDARDIZED DATA WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED PROGRAMMATIC AND POLICY DECISIONS. LIFT OFF- BEST PRACTICES IN ALSO DRIVE ACCOUNTABILITY. WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A LIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE HA AS A WAREHOUSE ONCE IT'S LAUNCHED- THIS YEAR. AS WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO HAVE A CONTEST OR A ROAD MAP AND TO GUIDE OUR DECISIONS. SO IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY WE BEGAN DEVELOPING THE FIRST HDL C. ACTION PLAN WITH INPUT AND DATA GATHERED FROM COUNCIL MEMBERS. PRACTITIONERS PROVIDERS AND PERSONS WITH LIFT EXPERTISE FROM ACROSS THE STATE. HIS ACTION PLAN WILL INCLUDE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND SERVE AS OUR GUIDING STAR IN OUR CONTINUED WORK TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE. AT THE OCTOBER TWENTY SIX TWENTY TWENTY MEETING THE COUNCIL ADOPTED THE ACTUAL PLAN FRAMEWORK WOULD KEEP UP WITH FIVE KEY AREAS BASED ON AN EQUITABLE COLBECK NINETEEN. HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE AT THE CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL I'M GRATEFUL TO THE COUNCIL FOR THEIR WORK FOR THEIR DILIGENCE. IN DEVELOPING THIS COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN AND APPRECIATE THAT YOU ALL WILL BE HEARING FROM ONE OF OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS TODAY ALSO MEMBER JODY. I CATCH CATFISH RIGHT. IN ADDITION TO FOR. OUR AND ACTION OR TO LOSE SOLVING HOMELESSNESS REQUIRE. THAT ALSO IN THAT THEY IT IN THAT WE EMBRACE NEW UP. THIS BEEN THE CASE AS BEEN OUR NOTED- WITH ROOM KEY AND THE HOME KEY INDUSTRY. PROJECT ROOM KEY IS THAT BY OUR CALL IN THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL. I AND THEY HAVE SUCCESS PROVIDE IN HOUSE TO OVER THREE PEOPLE ACROSS FORTY TWO COUNTIES. BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF PROJECT HE THE STATE CREATED HOKEY TO PURCHASE HOTELS RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES AND OTHER HOUSING. TO CONVERT THEM INTO PERMANENT HOUSING FOR PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. HCD LEVERAGE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUNDS PLUS FIFTY MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AND FORTY FIVE MILLION THAT WAS LEVERAGED THROUGH PHILANTHROPIC GIVING. IN A MATTER OF MONTHS WE WERE ABLE TO SCALE AT AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL PROVIDING OVER SIX THOUSAND UNITS UNDER BUDGET AND ON TIME. WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE TO THE- EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL PARTNERS INCLUDING COUNTIES AND CITIES HOUSING AUTHORITIES IN TRIBES. THEY MADE THIS HAPPEN AND THEY MADE A STOP IN AT IN THE RECORD TIME. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION TO DEVELOP HOUSING NEEDED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. FOR CONTINUED HOME KEY ACQUISITIONS. WE'RE ESTIMATING THAT NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND ADDITIONAL PERMANENT HOUSING UNITS CAN BE FUNDED WITH THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT. AND TO SUSTAIN THIS MOMENTUM HE ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE EARLY ACTION BY APPROVING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND WEBER CALLING HOME KEY TO POINT OUT. LET ME ALSO SHARE THAT CALIFORNIA'S INNOVATIVE HOW HUNKY MODEL IS QUICKLY DEVELOPING AS A BEST PRACTICE ACROSS THE NET AT THE NATION AND ALSO WITH INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION. TO DATE OUR TEAM HAS SPOKEN TO OREGON TO WASHINGTON TO VERMONT TO MINNESOTA NEW YORK CITY NEW MEXICO NEW MEXICO ADD TO OUR FOLKS AT HYDE IN THE TEAM ALSO FROM BARCELONA SPAIN. ALL OF THESE PARTNERS AND INDIVIDUALS ARE CONSIDERING HOW TO UTILIZE THIS PROGRAMMATIC FRAMEWORK TO EFFECTIVELY HOUSE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS QUICKLY AND PERMANENTLY. FINALLY AS WE MOVE WE MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HEALTH AND HOUSING. WE SHOULD ALSO INVEST IN BUILDING LOCAL CAPACITY TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE ABLE TO EQUITABLY ACCESS RESOURCES AND HOUSING WITH DIGNITY RESPECT AND EQUITY. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY- WE LAUNCH WITH AN AGENCY THE STATE'S HOUSING THIS INITIATIVES. THAT WE WERE ABLE TO LAUNCH THIS INITIATIVE- AS A IN RESPONSE TO AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT. AT THIS LEGAL PLATFORM ENABLES US TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO PREVENT TENANTS LANDLORDS HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS- TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW HELPING TO KEEP FAMILY'S HOUSE. UGH WE INTEND TO LEVERAGE- USED. AS WE CONTINUE OUR RAISING AWARENESS AND EDUCATION ABOUT HOMELESSNESS. I ALSO IN THE COMING WEEKS WE WILL BE ANNOUNCING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONTRACT GRANTS TOTALING FOUR POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION. TO HELP GRANTEES. NOW WITH THE FOCUS ON PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND A PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS RACIAL EQUITY AND SOLUTIONS FOR YOUTH. EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. R. A. THAT AND STAFF BEEN HER AT WORK. WE NOTE BOTH INNOVATIVE IDEA AND VIEWS WITH ACTION DATA FUNDING WELL NAY TO SUCCESS AS WITH COUNTY. ARE EAGER TO CONTINUE WORK. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS STILL MUCH MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME THE TENSION LOOK FOR TO THE QUESTIONS.

THROUGH YES THROUGH THE QUARTERLY WE'LL ASK FOR EXPANDED DATA ANNUAL REPORTS CONSUMER IT WHERE WE NEED REQUESTED ADDITIONAL DATA- FROM THEM SO THAT WILL BE COMING IN AND YOU KNOW HERE IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON PEOPLE SIR I'M SO WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE DATA THAT'S THAT'S- BUT- REALLY GOOD ONLINE IT'S WELL OVER A YEAR OLD AT THIS POINT SO I WOULD. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE WAIT TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I'M HAPPY TO THE SECRETARY'S POINT. AND THAT WILL BE SOME OF THE DATA WE WILL BE ABLE TO PULL IN IN MUCH MORE LIFETIME ONCE EACH DAY. GREAT DO WE DO WE GET A REPORT JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. HE POINTED I WOULD I NEED A MINUTE TO JUST PULL THOSE UP AND I WOULD JUST- I WOULD I WOULD NOTE THAT I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IN. MEANING FOR THAT ANNUAL REPORT WE WERE NOT. ASKING PEOPLE HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY SERVED. YES NUMBER SIR I DON'T THINK WE WOULD NECESSARILY CARE POINT AROUND BROKERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE DON'T GET TO THAT LEVEL WHAT KIND OF SERVICES IN A REPORT YOU'RE COLLECTING- FOR TWENTY TWENTY. YEAH I KNOW I THINK IT JUST BE GOOD TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SERVED IN AND THEN GOING JUST BACK TO MY QUESTION REGARDING THE COUNTIES- I KNOW THAT WHEN WE WENT TO. HOP THAT WE DID INCLUDE THE COUNTIES AYE I WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT A NUMBER OF THE COUNTIES- TRADITIONALLY- HADN'T- DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ACTION IN THE HOMELESSNESS ARENA I JUST WANTED TO- SORT OF GET YOUR VANTAGE POINT ON- AS SOON AS COUNTY STARTED TO SPEND THE KEEP MONEY ON IF YOU GOT A SENSE OF WHERE THAT WAS BEING SPENT AND WHETHER YOU THOUGHT THAT COUNTIES WERE ACTING AS AGGRESSIVELY AS YOU KNOW AND FEEL A SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE WERE ALL FEELING UP HERE AT THE STATE. YEAH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT- PERHAPS SPENDING WHICH ARE JUST A REMINDER. I JUST GOT ACCESS TO HERE IN MAINE AND SO WHAT WE'LL BE SEEING A LOT MORE OF THAT ADDITIONAL. DETAIL HERE IN THIS. IN THE NEXT TEN REPORT I MENTIONED BUT BUT FROM THE APPLICATIONS RECEIVING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE'VE BEEN DOING WE DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE SPENDING THAT MONEY DOWN IN ANY. SORT OF MASS LIKE LESS QUICK- EFFICIENT WAYS AND THEN CITIES AND INTO YOUR SEATS. ONE OF THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE WE ONE OF THE REASONS WE- RE APPROPRIATED MONEY FROM THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE- WAS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO MANY COUNTIES NOT. ACTING ON HOMELESSNESS. IN SO HAVE YOU SEE. ANY PATTERNS BECAUSE- WITHOUT LOCK OF ACTION. NO I THINK THE ONE THING I WOULD MENTION THERE IS- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SEEING QUITE A BIT- OF COORDINATION AND SPENDING COORDINATION BETWEEN CITIES COUNTIES AND CRCS PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO KEEPING FOLKS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS STATE FROM CORBIN. I'M SO I WOULD% EXPECT THAT WERE SEEKING- YOU KNOW WHETHER THIS IS SPECIFIC OR SPECIAL ACCESS TO THIS YEAR OR NOT I THINK WE DID SEE AND HAVE SEEN. IN THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE GAVE OUT FOR KOBE- THAT AND THAT COUNTY RECEIVED PART OF. FUNDING AS WELL AND NOT FINDING. WAS SPENT ON QUITE QUICKLY. RIGHT STATE TAKING THEM SAFE- AND RANCHO WILL BE INTO. SITE SOME QUITE. ACTION THIS YEAR SPECIFICALLY IN RELATION. TO SOME OF THE NEW AROUND. THE NATION GREAT FOR THAT LET'S MEMBER TO THE NEXT WILL HAVE SOME LOCAL PER. AS WELL TWO SOME MORE OF THAT DETAIL CONVERSE. PERFECT IN JUST LAST QUESTION IS WOULDN'T WANT THAT DATA GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FROM. THE JANUARY FIRST REPORTS. THERE WERE EIGHT FOR MID. SO THREE TO WEEKS NOW WE SHOULD HAVE AYE AYE SUMMARY AYE BOTH. HAPPY AND THAT THE CROSSOVER BETWEEN. OKAY GREAT YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE MORE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL FONG AND COOPER MR GABRIEL. THANK YOU MADAM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- I HAD A SPARE QUESTIONS VERY MUCH ALONG THE LINES OF- OKAY CHAIRMAN TANG AND I WIVES WANT TO THANK THE DEPUTY SECRETARY THE CHANCE TO DISCUSS EARLIER WITH HER SOME OF OUR- DATA COLLECTION INITIATIVES AND WAS REQUIRED BY THOSE CONVERSATIONS. I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK- GET OUT DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT HAVE BEEN ON SPENT EITHER IN TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OR PERCENTAGE OR IS THAT SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT FOR FEBRUARY TO GET AND THEN. JUST ALL THE BROADER QUESTION OF HOW MANY FOLKS WE CERTAINLY DO YOU HAVE ANY INCLINATION IS THIS TEN THOUSAND IS A FIFTY THOUSAND IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND WHITE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE MONEY THAT WE'VE ALLOCATED. IT TO AND THAT THIS THE SPEND DOWN PIECES I THINK WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THREE SEPTEMBER- IN THAT THE FEBRUARY REPORT MEETINGS YOU CAN GIVE TO YOU ALL. AND WE'RE TRACKING KEEP SPENDING A PARTICULAR QUITE CLOSELY RIGHT NOW KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THAT MONEY IS SET TO EXPIRE. AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR- ALL. BUT IF A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THAT FUNDING IS ALREADY BEEN OBLIGATED WE ARE EXPECTING. PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE NEEDS AROUND CO BUT THAT THAT MONEY. WILL BE SPENT QUITE QUICKLY. I'M SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE'RE- WE'RE TRACKING OBLIGATION RATES QUITE CLOSELY FOR HAPPEN SO WE'LL KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT. IN THE NEXT ROUND AND- AGAIN THOSE ARE ONLY FOR TO THOSE TWO LARGE. TOPPING STRANGER NOT REPEATING SOME OF THE OTHER STATE. STATE CONSERVATION. I'M AND THEN I BELIEVE- I REQUEST WAS IN RELATION TO THAT TO. SERVE YOU KNOW WE- WILL WE HAVE BETTER DATA WITH WITH AGE I THINK IT WAS ON LIKE A BROKE RECORD- BUT I THINK FOR SOME OF THE THINGS WE SUFFER FOR COPING IN PARTICULAR. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF SERVICE SOMEONE IS RECEIVING AND SO YOU KNOW WE STOPPED ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FOLKS I'M BEING SERVED. FOR SOME OF THE CONCRETE SHELTERS IN AND KOBE- AGUIAR-CURRY HE OUR YOU KNOW WE SAW THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THE ESTIMATED TO BE SERVED OR SOME OF THE HYGIENE STATIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO- IT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON. THE KIND OF LEVEL OF INTENSITY OF SERVICE THAT'S BEING PROVIDED. AND IS THERE THANK YOU AND IS THERE I MEAN SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF A DATA LACK HERE RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET. INTO MID FEBRUARY NUMBERS FROM SEPTEMBER IS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE TO WAIT SEVERAL MONTHS TO KNOW ABOUT WHETHER MONEY'S BEEN SPENT I MEAN THAT SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY EASILY. EASY THING TO KEEP TRACK OF. ORDERLY EXPECT. REPORTS FROM. THE THAT REQUIRE SOME DELAY FROM THEM. ASK MORE THAN THAT. THREE MONTHS WHICH MORE THAN WHAT IS STATURE. WERE BUT WE ARE GETTING. AT LEAST YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAVE SOME GREAT TEAM THEY NEED TO GET THAT INFORMATION FROM THEIR SUB GRANTEES. THEY NEED TO COLLECT THAT AND THEN SEND THAT TO US AND THEN WE NEED TO ANALYZE IT SO THERE IS A BIT OF A LACK OF EXPENDITURE DATA- THAT'S THAT'S NOT. PARTICULARLY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER WAYS WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE. BUDGET FUNDING PROGRAMS. AND YOU ACT YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CUT DOWN ON THAT. DELAY WITH THE NEW SYSTEM THAT YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT. EIGHTY ASKED DOES NOT. EXPENDITURE DATA. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE DOLLARS IT INCLUDES FUNDING OF. FUNDING FUNDING STREAM FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD START. THE WILL STILL NEED TO BE COLLECTING EXPENDITURE DATA- AND THERE IS A LACK FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY THIS YEAR GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF WORK. I WOULD I WOULD. I ENCOURAGE OUR LOCAL PANEL AFTER THIS TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE BACK- BUT GIVEN THE WORK IN THE URGENCY OF THE EMERGENCY THAT THEY HAD THIS YEAR. AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY UNDERSTANDING OF DELAYS IN GETTING US DATA. AND HAVING THAT BEING SUBMITTED TO US SO I ON THE EXPENDITURE PIECE. I'M THERE IT'S JUST A NATURAL DELAY AND THERE'S EVEN MORE SO DELAY IN DATA COLLECTION THIS YEAR GIVEN SOME OF THE URGENCY MICHAEL. I'M BUT BUT BASS I ASSIST IN WILL BE ABLE TO TELL US THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING SERVED IN MUCH MORE LIFETIME. THANK YOU JUST AND JUST ONE MORE QUESTION ON THIS ONE AND I WE CAN CONTINUE TO. OFFLINE I GUESS BEST. GET YOUR REFERENCE THAT SOME OF THE DATA YOU HAVE IS FOR HE PERHAPS FOR THE LARGER PROGRAMS BUT THAT THERE ARE OTHER STATE FUNDS ARE THERE OTHER STATE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED WHEN WE'RE NOT COLLECTING ANY DATA RELATED TO IT. OR OR OR THEIR DATA SYSTEMS AND YOU ANTICIPATE THAT IN THE FUTURE. WE'RE GONNA BILL TO COLLECT MORE DATA AROUND THESE OTHER STATE EXPENDITURES. OUTSIDE OF HIP HOP. LET ME ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WE HAVE. OTHER ADAM. A MAN. YOU KNOW EXAMPLE. TRYING TO GROOM KEY- THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS SERVED AS WE ARE NOW TRACKING THAT DATA. HOME KEY SIX THOUSAND UNITS- THE BUILT IN WE ARE TRACKING THAT. DATA AS IT SHOULD TO I THINK TO. TO THIS POINT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING. THE ABILITY TO. GATHER THIS INFORMATION IN. ONE PLACE AT IT. IT CURRENTLY DOESN'T EIST IN ONE PLACE- DEBT DAD LEVEL OF REPORTING. IS TIED TO A SPECIFIC PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR- ADMINISTERING A DOSE- THAT PROGRAM FUNDS. AND SO. YOU KNOW I DO RECOGNIZE- HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE A- COMPLETE PICTURE. H. D. A. S. I BELIEVE WILL- GIVE US DATE THE PLATFORM IN THE FOUNDATION NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO. TO BUILD THAT COMPLETE SYSTEM. THANK YOU YEAH I THINK HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE THREE REALLY AND SO BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT LOOKS HOLLISTER HOWARD MONEY HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT WHAT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE HELPING. IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IF WE HAVE TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT DATA AND DO DATA DRIVEN POLICY MAKING I WOULD BE VERY MUCH IN FAVOR THAT SO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS ON THAT FRONT. YEAH. THANK YOU FOR THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. I THANK YOU MEDICARE I JUST. WANT TO- THE SIM BEING THE CENTER VALLEY WE ALSO HAVE CERTAIN- CAN WE HAVE THIS ENORMOUS CONCERNS AND HOMELESSNESS- AS DO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES- AS SOMEONE WHO AS ADVOCATE AND INTRODUCED LEGISLATION ON CREATING A MORE ROBUST AND FUNCTIONAL STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE RECONCILE. THE AS MY AS MY COLLEAGUES IN THE BAY AREA IS MENTIONED THAT SENSE OF URGENCY TO INVEST RESOURCES- ALONG WITH THE DATA LAG AS A MY COLLEAGUE LOS ANGELES MANSION- IS THERE A WORK AROUND RIGHT NOW WHERE I KNOW THAT COUNTIES ARE COLLECTING BEARS H. INPUTTING INFORMATION IN THEIR LOCAL AGENT MY **** DO YOU GUYS REGULATE TALK TO THE COCS TO GATHER THAT DATA- AND AT LEAST TO HAVE THAT. HAVE A OF A MORE REAL TIME PICTURE. AS A WE AS YOU DEVELOP THIS. STATEWIDE DATABASE. ONE YES. TAG TEAMING HERE- YEAH SO IT REALLY SHOULD EACH DANCE WITHOUT GETTING TOO IN THE WEEDS HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SYSTEM WILL DO I'M SO WE WILL BE COLLECTING ALL FORTY FOUR ZERO C. LOCAL HMIS DATA INTO ONE STATEWIDE WAREHOUSE I'M SO THAT WILL INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO HAVE AND I'M AT THE DATA IS BEING ENTERED IN DANGER WE WILL BE DOING I'M A FREQUENT PULLED OF THAT DATA. INTO THE H. CARE ACT SYSTEM TO BE ABLE. TO LOOK AT THAT. EXACTLY YES. ON SOME OF THE OF YOUR MONEY WHAT THE TIME. FOR THIS I'M AWARE OF AS YOU MENTIONED BEFORE WE'RE OPERATING ON. SIX MONTH SIX MONTH OLD DATA- AND- SO- IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT YOU JUST CALL THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. ACCESS OR HMIS DATA. AGGREGATED AND AT LEAST HAVE THAT GOING ON. ISN'T THAT NOT KNOW OR MY SIMPLIFYING IT. YEAH IT'S SADLY NOT THAT SIMPLE- WE WISH IT WERE- IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE COMPLEX BERMAN DATA SECURITY STANDPOINT FROM ACTUALLY BUILDING THAT THE DATA SYSTEM ITSELF WE DO HAVE A VENDOR IN PLACE RIGHT NOW- AND A TEAM OF FOLKS AT WITHIN HCFC THAT ARE ARE ARE VERY VERY- INTENSELY BUILDING OUT THE SYSTEM WE HOPE IT WILL BE READY- BY THE END OF MARCH EARLY APRIL- FOR THE PUBLIC J. C. DASHBOARD AND THINGS LIKE OF THAT NATURE BUT- I'M QUITE A BIT THAT IS INVOLVED IN TEAMS OF PULLING THAT DATA AND- THE DUPLICATING AT DE IDENTIFYING IT AND BEING ABLE THAT TO VISUALIZE IT IN WAYS THAT MAKE SENSE FOR GENERAL PUBLIC. OKAY TRANSIT I WILL I'LL SAY THAT THE BIGGEST FILLED WAS TOUTED AS ONE OF THE FEW CITIES THAT THAT I GUESS I STILL ZERO WE'RE NOW AS THE- CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME. HOMELESSNESS IS STILL A CHALLENGE JUST BASED ON DEFINITION SO- I THINK I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES THAT- YOU KNOW WE PROBABLY NEED TO MOVE A LITTLE FASTER OR WE NEED MORE REAL TIME DATA AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPLICATIONS OF CREATING A STATEWIDE DATABASE BUT- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S- PROBABLY A NEED TO. FIGURE OUT A PARALLEL PROCESS TO COLLECT THAT THEY COLLECT INFORMATION SO THAT WE ACTUALLY- UNDERSTAND THE EFFICACY OF THE FUNDING THAT WORD THAT'S BEING ALLOCATE ESPECIALLY AS THE AMOUNTS ARE GROWING- SIGNIFICANTLY I'M GOING TO THE COCS- I MEAN IS THERE DISCUSSION I AM AT MY LAST QUESTION IS THERE DISCUSSION TO KIND. OF OR HOW OFTEN DO YOU. GATHER DATA NOT BEFORE THIS. FOR THE DATABASE SYSTEM BUT JUST. TO UNDERSTAND IT WHETHER WE'RE AFFECT. REDUCING HOME. YEAH. THIRTY THREE YEAH I WAS JUST GOING M. AND MANAGE AND YOU CAN IN HERE ALLEY AT I THINK THAT IT'S TIME IT'S ALSO AS WE LOOK AT- THAT DATA TO YOUR POINT RIGHT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE ACCELERATING AND DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GET THE H. E. I. S. SYSTEM IN PLACE AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE IT UP AND RUNNING BY THE END OF MARCH AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY ON THAT- ADDITIONALLY- IT WITH REGARD TO THE REPORTS THAT ARE COMING IN FROM- GRANT HE SAID HE'D BEEN HAPPY- DOLLARS. AND YOU KNOW WE TAKEN NOTED THAT IT TOOK YOU KNOW IMPORTANT ALSO- TO AT TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION AND- AND SORT OF PICK EXTRACTING A MORE. HOW IAN AND INTO WE TAKE THAT BACK A BIT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- I YOU KNOW KIND OF REITERATE- THE EFFORT THAT IS UNDERWAY THROUGH THE HDFC COUNCIL TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN WITH A SET OF GOALS OBJECTIVES. I AND YOU THE CLIP WE SHOULD ALSO SORT OF IDENTIFY AND THAT THE VERY ESPINO STATE AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING TO IMPLEMENT THAT ACTION PLAN. AND IN THAT THE CONNECTION THERE TO THE DATA IS GOING ON ASKED WE- OF FINALIZE OUR ACTION PLAN AND ESTABLISH YOU KNOW AT A SET OF- STANDARDIZED THE DATA THAT IS- YOU CAN SORT OF KNOCK COMMON. KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING WE WILL BE ABLE TO- TO. MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT ABOUT PROGRAMS AND POLICIES AND ALSO M. S. YOU KNOW MENTIONED EARLIER BE ABLE TO LIFT UP THE- GOOD WORK THAT IS HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS BEING OUT AT THE STATE. I'M IN BUT ALSO YOU KNOW- PROVIDE TARGETED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING AND OUR SUPPORT. SO IMAGINE THAT BECAUSE- WERE WERE MINDFUL WE ARE WORKING WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY AND WORK YEAH WELL FOCUS BOTH ON AT ESTABLISHING A DATA SYSTEM THAT ENABLES US TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE THOSE INFORMED DECISIONS. BUT ALSO- TO MAP OUT AN ACTION PLAN THAT DRIVES THE WORK THAT IS HAPPENING- ACROSS AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR AND A IS AN I THINK THE DAY IS- EXTRA IMPORTANT AS AS A REAL TIME AS WE CAN GET I'VE- TOWARD NUMBER FACILITIES UNLESS AND- THE- OF THE BUDGET CHAIRMAN AS HAD NUMBER HEARINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE BAY AREA- SO YOU KNOW WE AND I HAVE ACTUALLY ACCESS AND LOOKED AT MY AGE IN MY SYSTEM IN KERN COUNTY- WITH THE COLLABORATION FOR THE CITY IN OUR COUNTY SO I MEAN I'VE SEEN THE DATA I- IT'S BY NAME IT'S OUT THERE. I CAN CALL EVERY COUNTY HMIS I CAN ACCESS OR I CAN ASK FOR INFORMATION AND I AGREE AGGREGATE THE DATA SO IF I CAN DO IT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE LIKE IF WE WHEN WE IS OF THAT LEGISLATION SHOULD BE OPERATING AS MUCH REAL TIME AS POSSIBLE- INSTEAD OF OPERATING ON SIX MONTH INFORMATION WHERE THINGS HAVE CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY ESPECIALLY WITH COVERAGE- EVERYTHING IS CHANGING BY THE MOMENT AS AN YOU KNOW AND HOMELESSNESS CONTINUES TO POSSIBLY GROW ADDRESS PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AS WELL AS A BIG CHALLENGE SO I THANK THE CHAIR FOR THE ADOPTING THIS QUESTIONS. AND BECAUSE WE WORK. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG I THE PART OF. THIS IS. OF THE FACE OR SELL AND IS THAT COUNTY OPERATES. DID YOU SYSTEM SYSTEMS A DOES NOT COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. MUCH LESS WITH THE STATE. SO THANK YOU SECRETARY FOR YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS NEW DATABASE THAT BRINGS IN. A LEASE INFORMATION ON THE ON THE FEDERAL SIDE- AND HOPEFULLY WITHIN. NOT TOO MANY YEARS FROM NOW WE ARE ABLE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT TALKS TO EACH OTHER WHERE WE HAVE CITIES AND COUNTIES- BEING ABLE TO ALSO GIVE US THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO. ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING GOOD POLICY. I WANT TO BE- I LOVE THAT WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE AND ROBUST CONVERSATION- WE DO HAVE. A LOT OF MEMBERS THAT WISH TO SPEAK WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER QUICK SILVA A QUICK SILVA. AND I ARE GOING TO- A CHAIR TODAY FROM HOUSING ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK SO. MISTER COOPER ALL. YEAH I'LL BE BRIEF MESSAGE. OF A YOU MESSICK THANK AND YOUR- FOR ALL YOU DO. NOT JUST FALL ON THE FONG QUESTIONS- DID. FORTRESS WHICH ABOUT HOMELESSNESS- ALL TIMES COMMITTEE AND IN MY BIG ISSUE IS THAT I THINK YOU ALLOWS YOUR SAYING ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION. HAS SOME TYPE OF MILK MENTAL ILLNESS AND 70% HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS I WAS NUMBERS ARE DRAMATICALLY HIGHER WITH THAT. WE SPENT POINT FOUR BILLION SINCE YOU KNOW TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND I BELIEVE MISS MORALIS SAID THAT THEY'RE ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT. OF THE FOLKS ARE IN THERE AND INNER EARLIER STATEMENTS. WAS ANY THAT MONEY EITHER PROGRAMS TARGETED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. OR JUST HOMELESSNESS A PERIOD. I KNOW DEFINITELY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER AND IT FINDS OUT BOTH WITHIN H. ET- AT THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE AND IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS I WENT AND MENTAL HEALTH AND- YEAH THE NEEDS AND I CAN I ALSO ASK OUR DIRECTOR OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT- COASTAL THE LAST KISS WAS RELATIVELY NEW AT THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND TO JOIN US FOR THIS HEARING AND SO- IF I MAY I CAN ASK HIM TO PUT A PROVIDE JUST AT SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THAT PROGRAM- BUT- YEAH. DEEPLY INTO BASICALLY THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES THE YOUNG DOLLARS ARE ALSO BEING ADDED THAT USED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORT OF SERVICES WE ARE ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR POPULATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COMBINATION OF HOUSING AND SERVICES APART- ABLE TO ACCESS YOU DON'T THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT. AND SERVICE DOUBLE WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE AND JUST SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM YEAH APPRECIATE SECRETARY THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS SO IMPORTANT WE CANNOT. FULLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS WITHOUT. ADDRESSING. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH. S. N. SEPT OR DEGREE AND LIMITS YOU KNOW THEY KNOW PLACE LIKE HOME. WORLD BUT IT'S NOT THE- ONLY ONE GUY ADDRESSES I. AT HOME BUSINESS AND MENTAL HEALTH CABINET- ARE ADMINISTER ALSO BY H. COME. EMERGENCIES TO PROGRAM THE HOUSING FOR HEALTH CAN YOU PRO THAT MEMBER CHIU WHAT DAHLE INVOLVING- BOB BOB OF GETTING- GETTING. LIST ARE YOU GENERAL THE NOT. FOR ME. SO IN TERMS OF THIS SCALE THE VOLUME BECAUSE OF THE ROUGHLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN FEDERAL AND STATE MONEY ADMINISTER AT H. U. D. FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS. NO PLACE LIKE HOME IT'S PROBABLY A YOU KNOW ALL OF THE DISBURSEMENTS MAILED TO THE PAYMENTS ALREADY MADE MORE THAN A BILLION OF THOSE. AB THREE BILLION DOLLARS SO REALLY ROUGHLY A THIRD MORE THAN A THIRD SO IS THIS- IS VERY CRITICAL THAT. WE THAT WE MAKE MORE MORE EFFORTS ARE IN PROGRAMS LIKE- LIKE MOBY DICK CYCLE AND I WAS I WAS FOLLOWING THE DEBATE AROUND THE DATE ACT- I THINK YEAH A LOT OF COMPLEXITY IN TERMS OF IN A GREAT RIGHT DATE WITH. WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT- THERE IS A LEVEL ALL DATA AT THAT AT A MINIMUM AND- IT. NEEDS TO AND HAS BEEN COLLECTED IN IN INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS AND I THINK NO PLACE LIKE HOME IS A GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE- WE DON'T ASK FOR THINGS LIKE PROJECT LOCATION. SERVICES AND AMENITIES WE ASK FOR THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS SERVICE AND THEY'RE VETERAN STATUS WHICH THEM QUALIFICATION UPON MORE. AT AS IN AS HOMELESS CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AT RISK OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. A NUMBER OF TENANTS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL DISORDERS OR THE NUMBER. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AT SERIOUSLY EMOTIONALLY THIS CHART- AND YOU KNOW THE AGES CHILDREN ADULTS. ARE HEAD OF. GEN REYES NEEDS. ARE CURRENTLY LEVELS AND J. IN THAT. ARE WHAT DO YOU WERE. WEBER LEAVING ON THIS VERSUS DOES NOT COMING SHELTER ALL THESE DATA. IS EXTRA RICH WE ARE. FOR THE NOT LIKE. SOMETIMES IT TAKES MORE TIME TO THE- AT COLLEGE FROM LOOK JUDGED BUT THAT I THINK IS THE AIRPORT THAT THE SECRETARY AND THE DEPUTY SECRETARY WERE MENTIONING ABOUT. INTEGRATING ALL OF THESE ABOUT A MINIMUM WE SHOULD BE DOING BASS IS SPECIFICALLY WITH PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE IS ADMINISTERED. ADMINISTERING SUCH AS THE MARKETS LIKE- ARKANSAS. SO SKEWED ME RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW IT'S A CRIMINALS IT WAS FREEZING TODAY WAS THIRTY DEGREES OF FOR MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE SOUTH WAS COLD AS HELL APPEAR. SO THESE MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THE THING IS THE REFUSAL KNOCKING TELL ME WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS WHEN THEY'RE GOING OUT THERE THESE PROGRAM CITY OR COUNTY WHAT A GETTING FOR REFUSALS HOW MANY FOLKS REFUSING SERVICE AND HELP OBVIOUSLY IT'S GROWN EXPONENTIALLY. BUT TO HAVE THAT AND I NEVER HEARD ANYONE FROM ANY STATE AGENCY IN THE SEVEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. THESE PEOPLE ARE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL TALKING ABOUT PUTTING THEM SOMEWHERE IN HOUSING THEM GETTING THEM. A SHALLOWER SHELTER MEDICATION AND SOME USEFUL TOOLS WILL GET. EVENED OUT AND BE ABLE TO GO ON THEIR OWN BUT NO ONE'S ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THE AND THAT'S WHO PEOPLE SEE EVERY DAY- CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL THERE'S BEEN NOTHING ADDRESS THAT WHATSOEVER. FROM ANY STATE AGENCY TO DEAL WITH THAT. AND LIKE I SAID IF IT'S FREEZING UP HERE AND SOME WAS OUT WALKING WITH NO SHOES. AND NO COAT ON THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S AN ISSUE AND WE NOT ADDRESS THAT SO I'D LOVE TO SEE SOME NUMBERS ON YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID THE 70% NUMBER WHATEVER WAS SEVENTY THOUSAND. BUT PEOPLE REFUSING WHAT IS THE ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR AND I BELIEVE IT'S- MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND IT'S HARD TO GET OF OF THOSE IF YOU HAVE A JOB AND A HOUSE. LITTLE BEING HOMELESS SO IT'S GREAT THESE PROGRAMS AND A LOT BUT OUR OUR PROGRAMS HAVE. INCREASED NOT TO MENTION CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST CUSTOMER BESIDE READ. VERSES YOU. PAYING YOUR BILL. AND GAS BY THE NAY SO IT'S COMPOUND. IN REALLY HURTS PEOPLE BUT I THINK. WE'RE GONNA HAVE ON ITS COVER. ABOUT THIS ABOUT THE MENTAL ILLNESS. ABOUT THE SUBSIDIES IN AND OUT OF SECRETARY. I'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER I YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE- WHEN WE SPEAK TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS HOLISTICALLY AND- BOTH IN TERMS OF PREVENTION AND LISTEN AS- AS WAS. MENTIONED EARLIER ALSO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THAT WE FOCUSED. THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS- WHICH- IN MANY INSTANCES- ARE A RESULT OF. THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN MANY CASES IT'S ALSO THE RESULT OF THE LACK OF ACCESS TO PROPER HEALTH SERVICES FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IT'S ALSO A RESULT OF THE LACK OF- HAVING YOU KNOW. ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR ACCESS TO AND A AT A GOOD- JOB ON THAT YOU KNOW ALLOWS FOR FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO NOT HAVE TO SPEND MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOME ON. HOUSING COSTS INCIDENT. AND YOU WERE YOU KNOW CORRECT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE- HOLISTIC AND HOW WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH- SERVICES IN ENSURING THAT. THE STATE IS- IN OAK DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT TO COORDINATE AND ALSO TO GUIDE THE EFFORTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TODAY I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL BE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR- THE DIRECTLY FROM- PROVIDERS AND LEADERS UNDERGROUND AND I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL- TO GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE HAVING IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO. IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS IN THE FUNDS THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT. I AM ALSO OF COURSE YOU KNOW VERY. EXCITED TO SEE THAT THIS NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND HOUSING AND HEALTH SERVICES WITH IT YOU KNOW WITH A FOCUS ON MENTAL. HEALTH AND SO I JUST CLEAN AND LOOK TO CAN TO WORK WITH YOU THE LEFT. ASKED WE- YOU KNOW IT'S SAW. IN ADDRESSED. THAT DEFEAT THE ASSISTANCE ACROSS OF FROM KNOW WE TO ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE DATA AND HAVING GOOD RELIABLE DATA TO INFORM OUR DECISIONS BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE RAISING THIS THAT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THAT COMPLEXITY OF HOMELESSNESS IN SOME CASES- AND THE NEED. TO ENSURE THAT WERE- PROVIDING. US SERVICES- FOR POPULATIONS THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADJUSTED FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE OF THE HEARING THE NEXT PANEL IS READY TO GO SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE COGNISANT OF- SO WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TWO PANELS THE ADDITIONAL PANELS WILL ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH THE MENTAL HEALTH CALLENGES AND PANEL THREE BUT I DO WANT TO GIVE THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED AN INTEREST TO ASK QUESTIONS TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS SO WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PORTAL SILVA. MR CHIU INDUSTRY KINDLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KIRKSVILLE THE PLACE. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND- I KNOW TIM IS GOING BY BUT THIS IS SUCH A VITAL CONVERSATION AND I HOPE THAT SOME OF YOU WILL STAY WITH US EVEN AFTER YOUR PANEL- AGAIN I WILL BE A SPEEDY HERE BUT- TO THE MADAM SECRETARY HOUSING DIRECTOR OF ALASKA'S AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GET HER LAST NAME BUT KELLY. I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU I KNOW THAT WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS IS NOT ONLY DIRE BUT IT IS NEVER ENDING AND TO ALL THOSE PROVIDERS OUT THERE THAT WORK TIRELESSLY BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE ALL KNOW AND A- IS THE DEATHS. EVERY DAY WE'RE LOSING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE NOT ONLY TO COALBED BUT BEFORE THAT IT WAS. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. IN ORANGE COUNTY- WE ARE NOT THE ORANGE COUNTY HOUSE WIVES WE ARE ORANGE COUNTY LOSING. UP TO FORTY PEOPLE A MONTH. THAT ARE DYING ON ORANGE COUNTY STREETS. SOME OF IT IS NO COVERT RELATED BUT THIS WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT I DID STARTED MY FIRST COMMENTS AND I REALLY REALLY WANT. AND EMPHASIS IS ON THIS IS AS THE GOVERNOR TALKED LAST YEAR ABOUT USING STATE LANDING COUNTY LAND IN BRINGING IN MOBILE UNITS AND BRINGING IN TENTS AND SHELTERS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHEN COVE IT DIES DOWN WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THOSE FACILITIES AFTER BECAUSE WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE HOMELESS THAT IS A QUESTION. SECOND LIGHT BASICALLY AGING AS WE KNOW WITH CO THAT ARE FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS. ARE- MARKETS ANY PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO USE THE FACILITY HAS BASICALLY BEEN CLOSED DOWN. AT THE CORE OF OUR STATE. OUR NATION TO JUST HAVE A SAFE PLACE FOR SOMEBODY TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND USE A BATHROOM IS NOT PROVIDED. SO ONE OF MY **** IS WHAT TO OUR CONTINUUM OF CARE STAR HEALTH PROVIDERS. IS AT THE LEAST WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET FACILITIES OUT WHERE WE KNOW HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE CONGREGATING. THIS SHOULD BE A VERY BASIC RIGHT HOUSING SHOULD BE OUR RIGHT BUT SIMPLY TO USE A BATHROOM AND I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE YOURSELF DRIVING. AS I DID FROM FULLERTON SERVICE SACRAMENTO THERE IS NO PLACE TO USE THE FACILITY UNLESS YOU'RE AT A REST STOP OR AT A GAS STATION AND WE KNOW ARE HOMELESS DO NOT HAVE CARS. AND IT'S NOT A PLEASANT THOUGHT. BUT WE HAVE TO DO BETTER SO DATA IS IMPORTANT I MEAN WHAT I KNOW BUT I CAN TELL YOU WE CAN GO ON. TO OUR LIST OF PEOPLE WHO DIED AND WE CAN COUNT THOSE EVERY SINGLE MONTH THERE'S A PRIEST AND FULLER TEN. FATHER DENNIS REPORTS THIS EVERY SINGLE MONTH OF HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE IN ORANGE COUNTY. SO DATA IS IMPORTANT BUT WE GOTTA FOCUS ON WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE AND WHY THEY'RE DYING. AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED MR JIM COOPER WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION ARE PART OF THE STORY. AND WE HAVE THE VAST STATE LANDS THAT ARE NOT BEING USED. AN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND WE OF NORWALK THESE ARE PLACES THAT USED TO HOUSE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO HOUSING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO I'VE SAID A LOT HERE I'M GOING TO KEEP SAYING THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK BUT IT IS ABOUT DATA. BUT IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING AND I KNOW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF I MAY I JUST BASICALLY WANT TO MENTION THAT- D. SPONSORED WERE MADE AVAILABLE PARTICULARLY THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION- THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE BY AND IN THE PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIS PAST SUMMER AS A RESPONSE ACTUALLY IT WAS IN.

IT'S HAPPENING I KNOW THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE BUT- WANT TO JUST MENTION THAT. RELATED TO THIS- IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW WE END HOMELESSNESS AT SOME POINT NOT JUST HOW DO WE MAINTAIN THE CURRENT LEVELS- BUT WANT TO BRING UP THE TOPIC. OF A GAPS IN ITS ANALYSIS ONE THAT I THINK YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA IS. FOR A COLLEAGUES IF WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN TO END HOMELESSNESS. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING DONE. WHAT THE LEVEL OF THE PROBLEM IS AND WHAT IS THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT IS BEING DONE. AND WHAT THE NEED IS A GAPS IN ITS ANALYSIS AND- I TO BUILD THE SPACE LAST YEAR I WAS TOLD BY THE NOOSA MINISTRATION THAT. YOU WOULD BE WORKING ON A GAPS IN ITS ANALYSIS- IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU PROBABLY KNOW FEDERAL HARD- WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THIS. COULD YOU GIVE US A STATUS ON THE CONVERSATION AROUND GAPS IN NEEDS ANALYSIS. AND WHERE THAT IS AT THIS POINT. YES IT IS. SO MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU- I WILL ASK YOU TO ALLEY TO PROVIDE. MORE DETAILED INFORMATION BUT- I DO THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A YOU KNOW COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT INTO IDENTIFYING. THE AREA OF- GAPS OR THE AREA OF NEED. ONE- STEP IN GETTING TO THAT PLACE IS- HAVING THE DATA AND THE INFORMATION FROM THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE HAVE ALL FORTY FOUR CONTINUES OF CARE THAT HAVE EXECUTED- BEAST. USED AGREEMENTS DATE ABOUT 80% OF THAT CONTINUES OF CARE TO DATE HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED THEIR DATA AND IT'S GOING INTO THE SYSTEM. AND SO HAVING THAT LEVEL THE INFORMATION WILL BE AT CRITICAL- BUT THERE ARE OTHER STEPS IN THIS PROCESS AND SO LET ME- ASK KELLY TO IT TO JUST BE A PRIVILEGE TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE OTHER EFFORTS. YEAH TO SO PART OF AD THAT HAPPENS APPLICATION WHICH IS DUE THIS COMING SATURDAY- IT IS SPECIFICALLY ASKING COMMUNITIES TO CEMENT THEIR LEVEL ACCESS ASSONANCE. I'M SO TAKING A LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM- FROM SHELTER AND OUTREACH TO PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS TO PREVENTION EFFORTS IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE POPULATION- WHAT WHAT KIND OF INTERVENTIONS THAT THE HOMELESS POPULATION MIGHT NEED. I AND WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY FUNDING AND SORT OF THE VARIATION IN GAPS ACROSS THOSE DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS STRINGS SO WE WILL BE TAKING UP A REALLY CLOSE LOOK AT THOSE APPLICATIONS AS THEY COME IN- I WILL SAY WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY COMMUNITIES THAT. THAT THEY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN DOING THAT KIND OF WORK AND SO WE HAVE- SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONTRACTS WE EXPECT TO BE IMPLEMENTING HERE IN AFFECTS MY OR TWO. HELP COMMUNITIES GET LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH ON THEIR ON THEIR DATA AND THEIR NEEDS- NEED ASSESSMENTS LOCALLY SO WILL BE WILL BE TAKING A LOOK AT WHERE WE HAVE- GOOD QUALITY GAS ASSESSMENTS ACROSS THE STATE AND REALLY I'M HELPING COMMUNITIES TO BETTER. I'M WEIRD WHERE THEY THINK WE NEED THAT INFORMATION THE SUPPORT. AND I WOULD SAY MADAM DEPUTY SECRETARY OF WE COULD MAYBE AFTER THIS WE GET AN UPDATE FROM YOU ON. SORT OF WHERE THINGS STAND WITH THAT INFORMATION. AS WE- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT CERTAIN STEPS ON OUR AND JOB. HOW WE WERE MEAN FOR THE GAPS IN THE ANALYSIS. ON DOES. AS YOU THINK ABOUT A AND IT'S AN- WOULD ALSO CALL ALSO AGENTS IS OUR- TO. THE STATE AS FAR AS THAT GAPS IN ITS ANALYSIS. THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT THIS IS LOCALLY- THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S STATE FUNDING THAT'S COMING AND LOCAL EITHER LOCAL FUNDING THAT THEY'RE HAVING THEIR SPIRAL FUNDING THAT'S COMING AND IT'S NOT REALLY A SOMETHING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NEED TO HELP SUPPORT. AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY HAVE GAPS WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM THAT THAT LEVEL AND THEN RAISE THAT UP TO THAT TO A STATE LEVEL I'M SO I WAS DOING IT WE ONLY HAVE A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE BUT REALLY WORKING THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR FULL RANGE OF. FUNDING STREAMS IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITIES ON THIS YEAR THE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE DOES THE STATE. FUNDING SUPPORT WHAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT YOUR LOCAL FUNDING SUPPORTED YOU HAVE THAT AND WHAT. THE PENALTIES ARE FEDERAL FUNDING AND HAVING BREAK THAT ALSO TO GET TOGETHER- SO I THINK STARTING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL UNDERSTANDING AT THE STATE LEVEL AS MANY PEOPLE THAT A LOT. IT IS OUR CURRENT THINKING- AS WE AS WE GET THAT DATA IN. THE COMING WEEKS. THANK YOU AND OUT OF RESPECT FOR TIME- LOVE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU MORE ON THIS- OFFLINE SO. APPRECIATE THAT THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU SOME MEMBER K. WELCOME AND THE ALLEY IS LATEST HERE HAS- I YOU KNOW A LACK OF THE LAW TERM. AS INHIBITING MEANINGFUL ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS- AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING EVEN BEFORE POPE IN NINETEEN I CALIFORNIA SPENDING MORE MONEY AND YET THE PROBLEM WAS CONTINUING TO GET WORSE WHICH WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS HAPPENING ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I BELIEVE THAT- NATIONWIDE HOMELESSNESS WOULD HAVE DECLINED IT HADN'T GONE UP SO MUCH IN CALIFORNIA IS OVERWHELMED- THAT NATIONAL FRIENDS SO- I QUESTIONS EITHER FOR THE SECRETARY OR DEPUTY SECRETARY IS. HI WHY DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHY DO YOU THINK CALIFORNIA'S HAD SUCH. A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. ALL. WELL LET LET LET ME ANSWER TO FROM THE START BY- IN MENTIONING IT BUT I THINK WE ON THEY'LL SORT OF YOU KNOW BEFORE GOING INTO THIS YOU KNOW PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE PORTABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN PLACE WHERE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OTHER ON LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WERE ALREADY PAYING OVER 50% OF- THERE- INCOME TOWARDS RENT AND SO THERE'S AND YOU PRIORITIES FOR US ARE. PRESERVING AND EXPANDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN ADDRESSING THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS AND IT'S NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED OF COURSE YOU KNOW TO THE- THE CHALLENGES ARE HAVING AS A STATE YOU KNOW ISN'T IT UNITED RELEASE TO HOMELESSNESS I THINK THIS LAST YEAR WITH THE AT THE- AND QUITE FRANKLY IN ONGOING BECAUSE WE'RE STILL VERY MUCH IN AN EMERGENCY AND INDUSTRY A PANDEMIC- PROVIDERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAVE BEEN STRETCHED- TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW SAVE- SHELTERING TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO PROPER LEVELS- SUPPORT- TO ALSO ADAPT AND TO. THE CHANGING PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES- COMING BOTH FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND FROM THE STATE AND QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THAT THEY HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB- WITH AT THE STATE SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN- PROVIDING- A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE O WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES I DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW AND- THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE HOME KEY PROGRAM IN THE ABILITY OF THE LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP ON A PURCHASE THE SCALE- ASSETS AND CONVERT THEM TO PERMANENT HOUSING. ALSO IF YOU DON'T DEMONSTRATES- THAT AB THROUGH THAT LEVEL OF COLLABORATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AND- AND OF COURSE THE FUNDING AND MADE AVAILABLE- BUT WE YOU KNOW EVEN IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC- ARE ABLE AND CAPABLE OF. MAKING PROGRESS I YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE- DOING WHAT WORK. CURRENTLY WHICH IS TO DEVELOP A- ACTION PLAN VERY SPECIFIC- STATE OUR GOALS IN THE- THAT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE AGENCIES IN TERMS OF SOLVING- IN THE DRESSING AND CO INVESTING- TO SOLVE. HOMELESSNESS I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE- DRIVING. ALLEN AT CALEDONIA BY HAVING A COMMON- DATA LANGUAGE- OR COMMENT SYSTEM TO GAUGE HOW THAT YOU KNOW SERVICES ARE BEING- PROVIDED AND- WE ARE YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE. GAPS I AND I WOULD ALSO SAY YOU KNOW HAVING US- YOU KNOW SPENT- A FEW YEARS UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WORKING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. THAT IT'S GOING YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HAVE- OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS- INVEST MORE FUNDING I TO- COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESSED YOU KNOW THAT THE HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES. THAT WE'RE HAVING AT THE STATE. SO I AM IN NO- I DO THINK WE- THE PHONE- THE LEADERSHIP THE AT THAT THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION- THAT THAT NEEDS TO. GET UP BUT WE WILL DEVELOPING AT THE STRONGER AT COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION SYSTEM BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT WERE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND YOU KNOW. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU AND SO I THINK THE OTHER ONE THE SORT OF DIFFERENTIATING FACTOR BETWEEN CALIFORNIA OTHER STATES THAT I HEARD YOUR RESPONSE WAS THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING WHICH IS CERTAINLY TRUE OUR HOUSING SITUATION IS MUCH WORSE THAN ANY OTHER STATES HOWEVER. EVEN HOLDING THAT CONSTANT I THINK THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE- IN THE EFFICACY OF INTERVENTIONS WITH RESPECT HOMELESSNESS- FOR OTHER STATES VERSUS CALIFORNIA STILL HAS YOUR ADMINISTRATION LOOKED AT WHAT OTHER STATES THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF DOING AND TRIED TO MODEL- IT'S PRACTICES AFTER THOSE THAT HAVE PROVEN SUCCESSFUL ELSEWHERE CAN YOU GIVE ME A FEW. EXAMPLES OF WHERE YOU'VE DONE THAT. YES DEFINITELY- WE JUST YES YESTERDAY- DEPUTY SECRETARY- SATIN AND I WERE ON THE CALL WITH- HM NUMBER FOR THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO END HOMELESSNESS. WHO IS ACTUALLY WORKING ON A RESEARCH STUDY ON HOME KEY AND OTHER- STRATEGIES. DURING THAT CONVERSATION WE- SPOKE EXTENSIVELY ABOUT- THE WORK THAT IS UNDER WAY TO STRENGTHEN THE HDFC COUNCIL TO STRENGTHEN THE- THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IN THE INTER AGENCY COORDINATION. AND SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE ON MINNESOTA. IN THE INTER AGENCY HOMELESSNESS COUNCIL STRUCTURE THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE. AND THAT YOU KNOW OF COURSE WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT STATES LIKE WASHINGTON THE KING COUNTY. AND- IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN REALLY INCREDIBLE JOB. AND THEN THE LAST THING THAT I WILL MENTION IS- AS A FORMER. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A HOUSING AUTHORITY- IN SAN ANTONIO AND THEN ALSO SPENT TEN YEARS WORKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN LA. FOR THE WORKING FOR THE ONLY CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY. THE ROLE OF HOUSING AUTHORITIES IS ALSO REALLY AND IMPORTANT WE HAVE SOME HOUSING AUTHORITIES IN THE STATE THAT ARE DOING. REALLY AN INCREDIBLE JOB YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE IT RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO USING EITHER A PUBLIC HOUSING DOLLARS. AT TO ADDRESS- HOMELESSNESS. AND ACROSS YOU KNOW THE COUNTRY THEY ARE ALSO- OTHER RECOUNT COURTS HOUSING AUTHORITIES THAT ARE EITHER REPLICATING THE MODELS- HEARING IN CALIFORNIA OR- YOU KNOW CREATING. THEIR OWN SORT OF APPROACHES- YEAH I THINK IT LEND THEMSELVES WELL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO- TO REPLICATE HERE WITHIN THE STATE. THANK YOU THAT'S VERY GOOD HEAR I AND IS A CALL. I WANT TO ASK WHAT YOU AS THE LEGISLATURE ROLE- WHEN IT COMES TO OVERSIGHT OF HOMELESSNESS- RELATED SPENDING BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN RESISTANCE TO THOSE EFFORTS I HAD AN AUDIT THAT WAS OPPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL. I HAD A BILL THAT WAS VETOED. BY THE GOVERNOR AND SO- WHAT DO YOU HOW DO YOU ENVISION THAT RELATIONSHIP. I ENVISION THE RELATIONSHIP AS YOU KNOW- BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT IS NOT TRULY COLLABORATIVE JUST TESTING OUT. YEAH I THINK I HAVE BEEN WITH THE STATE FOR. NINETEEN MONTHS AND MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT- WE HAVE HAD A VERY COLLABORATIVE OPENED- RELATIONSHIP AT. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO. TO SOLVE THESE COMPLEX ISSUES. I THINK WE NEED TO OF COURSE. WORK ACT TOGETHER TO BRING A FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. I THINK THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY ARE. IT WITH REGARD TO DATA AND- IT ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT- AND- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT. AND SO. YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS IN YOU KNOW THE- AT. THE ROLE- I BELIEVE YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO- TO. TO ASSESS- HOW OF DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING APPROPRIATED- ARE BEING- SPENT AT THE IMPACT THAT THEY'RE HAVING- ALSO LOOKING OF COURSE- TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. WHAT IS WORKING WHAT IS NOT WORKING- WANTING A PROGRAMS ARE- AT SUCCESSFUL WHAT THE PROGRAMS ARE NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL. I EATABLES WILL SAY SORT OF A TENT AND GENTLY YOU KNOW SORT OF RELATED TO ENOUGH TO IT TO THE COP TODAY'S CONVERSATION. WITHIN THAT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WE'RE CURRENTLY. WORKING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FOUR THIRTY FOUR WHICH IS A BILL- THAT SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR IN TWENTY TWENTY. THAT WILL- MOVE HCD TO CONSOLIDATE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND TO DEVELOP. A STREAMLINED- FUNDING- APPROACH OR YOU KNOW. SOME WILL CALL IT A SUPER NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY APPROACH. AND THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT- IS THAT AS AN. EXAMPLE IS- IT DIDN'T EXAMPLE- THE LET'S- AT REALLY LOOKING FOR- TO IN IN THAT OUR AS YOU'LL STAY AGENCY WERE WERE AT TO- THE BEST SERVICE POSSIBLE TO- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE- ON THE DISNEY IN A DAILY BASIS OUR ORGANIZATIONS ARE WORKING ON- YEAH. DEVELOPERS OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS THAT ARE NOT DOING THEIR BEST TO EITHER PRESERVE OR EXPAND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY WHEN THEY CAN YOU KNOW COME TO THE STATE TO APPLY FOR DOLLARS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO STREAMLINE.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME I. WANT TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE AND JUGGLING OUR SIX MONTH OLD CHARLIE AND SELL- TEAMMATE CHIMED IN WITH UNWELCOME- AND INVITED PUBLIC COMMENTS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT IN ADVANCE- SO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MENTIONED THE- DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW ABOUT SCOPING FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE. THE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM STATEWIDE- WITH AN ANALYSIS OF GAPS IN NEEDS. WE'VE DONE THAT WORK IN OAKLAND- HAND- WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OF THE STATE'S ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND SO I JUST WANT TO FRAME IT IN TERMS OF THIS GAPS NEEDS ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS ISSUE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OAKLAND. SO OUR ANALYSIS HAS FOUND THAT THE ANNUAL COST BE WEAK AT NEED TO ACHIEVE FUNCTIONAL ZERO IN OTHER WORDS BEING ABLE TO QUICKLY RESOLVE HOMELESSNESS. FOR ANYONE WHO EXPERIENCES A HOUSING CRISIS WITH A GOAL OF YOU KNOW NINETY DAY FEWER IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS EVERY FIVE YEARS AND CAPITAL EXPENSES. I'M INTERESTED TIME ALL REFRAIN FROM GOING INTO DETAIL I'M I'M HAPPY TO FIELD ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT- EXACTLY THE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS THAT THAT WOULD FIND IN WHAT THEY WOULD DO WE HAVE THAT DETAIL AVAILABLE BUT SUFFICE IS TO SAY THAT THAT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION. TOWARDS THE EXPANSION OF MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ALREADY WORK IN OAKLAND IN THAT WE'RE ALREADY PUTTING IN PLACE. I'M THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN THE TO SCALE UP. OKAY HAS. YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT OKAY IS ALSO A LEADER ROLE IN INTO MERE SHE WAS COACH OF THIS- TO DO YOU. AS SYSTEMS MY- GAPS IN NEED TO NOW OF THE WEB IN ALBANY COUNTY I AM A I DON'T KNOW FOUND THERE AT THREE TWO OF DINNER. THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED BUT WOULD HAVE NO OKAY OR FUNDING FOR IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL INTERVENTIONS THAT WERE ALREADY PROVIDING THE NEED TO SCALE UP WITH RAPID RE HOUSING. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE. THE NEED FOR ESSENTIALLY ON GOING FUNDING TO SUBSIDIZE RENT FOR PEOPLE IN THREE DIFFERENT AREAS- ONE IS FOR A POPULATION OF FOLKS WHO DON'T NEED A VERY DEEP LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE. THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO POOR FOR A RENTAL MARKET AND SO THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM SHALLOW SUBSIDY. IS PROVIDE A SMALLER AMOUNT OF SUPPORT TO HOUSEHOLDS THAN TRADITIONAL DEEP SUBSIDIES. LIKE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I ARE IN OUR SYSTEM THAT WE NEED ABOUT NINE HUNDRED TWENTY OF THOSE ANNUALLY- WE ALSO NEED A MORE INTENSIVE INTERVENTION FOR SOME OF OUR SENIORS OAKLAND HAS. BEEN EVEN HOMELESS POPULATION AND SO WE FOUND THAT WE NEED SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN UNITS ANNUALLY OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR SENIORS. THIS WOULD BE A NEW AND MORE INTENSIVE INTERVENTION. THAN TRADITIONAL PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BUT NOT QUITE AS INTENSIFIED SAY A BOARDING KERR. HI AND THIS AND MOST IMPORTANT KEYS IS THAT WE NEED WE HAVE A GREAT MADE ALMOST TWO THOUSAND UNITS IN FACT. A DEEPLY AFFORDABLE UNITS WITH NO NEED FOR SUPPORT SERVICES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE EXPERT EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND OAKLAND. ARE NOT DISABLED I DO NOT HAVE- AT DISABILITIES THAT THAT REQUIRED THEM TO RECEIVE SUPPORT SERVICES. THEY'RE JUST TOO POOR FOR THE RENT AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE A DEEPLY AFFORDABLE. HOUSING STOCK IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM HOUSE. AND SELL AT THE COST OF THESE THREE INTERVENTIONS. TOGETHER ALONG WITH THE SEVENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT'S AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WE NEED IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE RECEIVED. FORTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE RESOURCES. WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I INSULARIS COULD KICKSTART AND NUMBER OF OUR INTERVENTIONS- AND HAVE. SHE WHAT IS KICK STARTING NUMBER. HE'S EXCITED ABOUT HER IN TO- THE RESOURCES FROM THIS HAVING US OPEN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO DADS OUR COMMUNITY CABINS PROGRAMS I SAFE PARKING SITES FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE ARE THESE- I'M MERGING SEA ONE HUNDRED EMERGENCY SHELTER BEDS. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO TRANSITIONAL HOUSING BEDS AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT COLAVITA ISOLATION BEDS AT THE STATE ARE PROVIDED FEMA TRAILERS- AND SO THAT'S DIED SPACES FOR ALL TOGETHER SIX HUNDRED NINE SIX HUNDRED NINE BEDS IN PARKING SPACES- ANARCHY FUNDED PROGRAMMING HAS SERVED OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE TO DATE AND IT IS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR PERMANENTLY HOUSING OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE. TO DATE- WE'VE ALSO JUST RECEIVED OVER TWENTY SOME TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN HOME HE FUNDING WHICH IS LEVERAGE LOCAL RESOURCES TO CREATE TWENTY ONE NEW UNITS OF FAMILY SHELTER AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR UNITS OF PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR SENIORS VETERANS AND OTHER OAKLAND OR SEARCH DANCING HOMELESSNESS- THE CITY WILL ACTUALLY OPEN ONLY BE OVERSEEING THE OPERATIONS AND SERVICES AT ONE OF OUR HOMES YOU PROJECTS THE QUESTION HALL. WHICH WILL SUPPORT TWENTY ONE FAMILY SHELTER UNITS AND FORTY TWO PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE UNITS- FOR SENIORS TO ACQUIRING RE HAVE THE BUILDING WE OF COURSE USE THANK YOU DOLLARS AND WE LEVERAGE LOCAL BOND DOLLARS AND HOUSING TRUST FUND DOLLARS- BUT HE FOR THE SUBSIDY IN THE SERVICES MOVING FORWARD. WE WHAT WE PUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CAP TO A CAPITALIZE OPERATING RESERVES- FOR THE PERMANENT HOUSING IN THIS FUNDS THE PERMANENT HOUSING OPERATIONS. FOR THIRTEEN YEARS. IN THE EVERYTHING YOU. INSURANCE TO THE- ARMED SERVICES COSTS AND SO- THAT IS THE WAY TO STRAY ONE TIME DAHLE. OUT TO HAVE THEM GO FURTHER- AND HAVE THEM. K. I. TO MULTIPLE YEARS AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CONTINUE TO DO MORE OF THAT HERE IN OAKLAND- SO MOVING FORWARD IF WE WOULD OF COURSE NEED TO IDENTIFY AND SECURE ANOTHER SOURCE OF OPERATING. SUPPORT AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS ONCE AT AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS- AND SUBSIDY ON THE RENTER'S EXPIRES AND WE ALSO NEED TO MORE RESEARCH RESOURCES TO FIND. OPERATING RESERVES AT FUTURE HOME KEY PROJECTS- ALL OF OUR HAPPEN AND ONE BROWN'S WANTING TO HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR- AND SO ON THAT'S THE SORT OF A- A AND NOW THIS IS WHAT WE NEED IN TERMS OF WHAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE STATE- THREE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES ABOUT O'QUINN'S HOMELESS BUDGET SITUATION THAT I WANT TO BRING TO THE- TO. YOUR ATTENTION. AND I HOPE THE ASSEMBLY WHAT WILL KEEP IN MIND FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE AS YOU BEGIN YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS FOR THIS YEAR- FIRST OBVIOUSLY IS THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE AND WHAT OUR DATA DATA ANALYSES HAVE SHOWN IS THAT WE NEED- OAKLAND'S HOMELESS BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IS JUST UNDER SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS BUT IMPORTANTLY ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT IS ONE TIME. INCLUDING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS IN JUST UNDER TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL COLLUDED FINDS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED- WE ACTUALLY ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND RELIABLE ON GOING REVENUE. AND THESE COME FROM FEDERAL AND LOCAL GENERAL FUND SOURCES I AND SO THAT'S JUST A LITTLE OVER ONE FIFTH OF WHAT ARE NOW SO GAPS IN NEEDS ANALYSIS HAVE SHOWN IS THAT WE NEED. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE FUNCTIONAL ZEROING IN OAKLAND- SECOND IS THE FACT THAT THAT GAP IN TERMS OF THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE ALL WE NEED IS THAT IS ABOUT TO GROW WIDER. AS ONE TIME STATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCES EXPIRING GET EXPANDED. BY THE MIDDLE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE HAVE FORTY POINTS MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME. THAT WILL BE EXPAND. THESE FUNDS THE- TO HUNDRED AND TWO P. CASH. THAT A HUNDRED AND EIGHT AT THE NEW KOBE ISOLATE BEDS THE PHOENIX. ONE HUNDRED GB TRADITIONAL BEDS SAFE PARKING FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE R. VIEWS. AS WELL AS PERMANENT HOUSING EXISTS FOR UP TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY HOUSEHOLDS ALMOST PREVENTION RESOURCES FOR AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS. AND PORTAPOTTIES AT FORTY OF OUR ENCAMPMENTS IN MOBILE SHOWERS AND LAUNDRY AND UP TO EIGHTEEN ENCAMPMENTS PER WEEK. UNLESS THOSE RESOURCES ARE REPLACED OR BACK FIELD MOVING FORWARD WE RISK LOSING OUT. I AM THIRD AND FINALLY IS THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE NATURE OF THE ONE TIME RESOURCES. AND THE BIGGEST NEED IN OUR SYSTEM WHICH AE LOCAL ANALYSIS IS I'VE AS I'VE TOLD YOU. HAVE DEMONSTRATED IS PERMANENT WE SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. ONE TIME DOLLARS CANNOT BE USED TO PERMANENT WE SUBSIDIZE HOUSING WHICH WILL GO WHICH REQUIRES AN ANNUAL OUTLAY. I SEE THIS IS WHY MAYOR SCHAAF'S SUPPORTS AB SEVENTY ONE. WHICH WOULD CREATE THE FIRST PUMP PERMANENT FUNDING SOURCE OF ITS KIND FOR HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD BE OF A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE FOR US LOCALLY- SO WITH THAT I'M PROBABLY OVER TIME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE- I DO APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE. WITH WITH CHARLIE HERE I DO HOPE THIS IS BEEN HELPFUL AND. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENT. AND TO YOUR SISTER CHARLIE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AS WELL. AS A SUPER PARENTS APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH RIGHT NOW. AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE GIVE OUR BEST MEMBERSHIP HAS BEEN A TRUE CHAMPION- ON THESE ISSUES AND- APPRECIATE- APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. WITH THAT WHEN WE GO TO OUR FINAL SPEAKER THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF TURNING POINT OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. MISTER JUDY CATCH ASIDE. SHARES MY NAME IS JODY CATCHES SIGHT ON THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF TURNING POINT OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. I ALSO SERVE AS THE VICE CHAIR ON THE FRONT MADERA CONTINUUM OF CARE. I'M OPERATE PROGRAMS IN THE KINGS TULARE. HOMELESS ALLIANCE OR CONTINUUM OF CARE. JURISDICTION I'M SERVE ON THE HOME OF COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL AND I AM THAT BOARD CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THIS FIELD ABOUT TWENTY YEARS I STARTED ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOME. AND TODAY I WORK SERVING ALL POPULATION EXPERIENCING A MUST MISS. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA THAT I WILL TRY TO GET THROUGH TODAY AND SPEAKING PRIMARILY FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND YOU. TULARE COUNTY WINDSTAR CASH FUNDS TO CREATE TWO FIFTY TWO STRATEGIC PLANS ONE FOR EACH COUNTY AND THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE HOME LAST PLANS COUPLED WITH CUTS PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE WHAT GUIDES AND DRIVERS ARE METRICS TECH COMBAT HOMELESSNESS IN THE AREA OUR REGION DOES HAVE THE FOURTH HIGHEST UNSHELTERED RATE IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE OTHER LARGELY URBAN C. O. C. S. CATEGORY WITHIN THAT CATEGORY. WE HAVE YES THEY KEEP IN CASH AS WELL AS CITY GENERAL FUNDS TO CREATE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS- pOF PORTERVILLE WE THERE WERE PREVIOUSLY NO SERVICES FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ASIDE FROM A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECT PROJECT OPERATED BY TURNING POINT OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA I AND WE USE THOSE FUNDS TO ESTABLISH A NAVIGATION CENTER WHERE ALL RIGHT AS OF YESTERDAY WE HAD SERVED SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY UNDUPLICATED INDIVIDUALS WITH DAYTIME SERVICES LIKE MEALS AND CASE MANAGEMENT. FILTERED THIRTY ONE INDIVIDUALS- AND SEE AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT EIGHTY PEOPLE COME THROUGH THE DOORS DALY FOR PERSPECTIVE PORTABLES TWENTY TWENTY A POINT IN TIME NUMBERS WERE JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED UNSHELTERED PEOPLE SO WE CAN SEE THE PIC COUNTS NOT A PERFECT MEASURE OF HOMELESSNESS AND THEY DO POSE SOME CHALLENGES SPECIFICALLY FOR COUNTING YOU. THEY DO PROVIDE A WAY FIRST YEAR STUDENTS TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS ADDRESSING SHELTERED AND UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FUNNY ROBERT LOW BARRIER NAVIGATION CENTERS THE ONLY FUNDING SOURCE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE OF HEAP AND HAPPEL CURRENTLY IT IS. EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT FUNDS. THIS COMMUNITY S. NOT A ENTIRE REACH WERE IN. FUNDS ARE AUTOMATICALLY. IT WE TO CAN BE FOR THESE AND- IN TWENTY. NINE OR AWARDED TO THE- SO THE S. THAT LEEDS. REGIONS RIGHT I IN FLYERS COUNTY IS. AFTER AND STOP PROGRAM EACH YEAR AND- ALSO YOUR RV HAS IMPACT ON ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AS FOLKS DON'T OFTEN TIME EVEN GET A FULL YEAR OF ASSISTANCE. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THESE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS WAS THAT THEY GAVE US THE FLEXIBILITY TO FIND WHAT'S NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND OUR SYSTEM OF SYSTEM SUPPORT WE CAN'T DO THE WORK WITHOUT THE SYSTEM SUPPORT FIRSTLY THE- LEAST SUCCESSFUL ASPECT OF THESE FUNDS IS THAT THEY ARE ONE TIME WHICH WE'VE% HEARD FROM OTHER PANELISTS IT'S HARD TO FIND FUNDS TO SUSTAIN. SOME OF THE PROGRAMS CREATED THROUGH THE USE INVESTMENTS I'M GOING I'M GOING RESOURCES ARE REALLY WHAT IS NEEDED YOU CAN'T CONTINUE THE WORK OR IN OUR MAINTAIN THE STAFFING AND THE RURAL COMMUNITIES- AND LYFT. SOME OF THE THINGS I'M GOING. I KNOW EXAMPLE WHERE FOR THE BILL IS CRITICAL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH THE VARIOUS KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS. NEEDED FOR YOU THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION- OR WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE FACE- THEY NEED SHELTER TIME I WHETHER IT'S TIME LIMITED SUPPORTED. RAPID RE HOUSING OPTIONS COUPLED WITH WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS FOR APPOINTMENT EDUCATION IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ALL OF THESE ARE PATHWAYS OUT OF HOMELESSNESS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS FOR YOUTH WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE CRUCIAL AND ASSISTING THEM. WITH REACHING THE GOALS THAT THEY HAVE TO AND THEY'RE HOMELESSNESS. ANOTHER STRATEGIC REQUIREMENT OF THE STATE FUNDING WAS SUPPORTING COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEMS. THIS IS BAN A SUCCESS AND NEEDED IT WOULD. IT'LL HELP TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THEIR SUCCESS BY ENSURING THAT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE A YOUTH CENTER COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM OR YOUTH CENTER TOOL CURRENTLY MANY COMMUNITIES ARE USING THE V. I SPENT THAT. I'M STILL ASSESSING NEED ABOUT IT IS THE ADULT VERSION ARE NOT THE YOUTH ARE SENT OR ANY SPECIFIC TO ALL. HISTORICALLY PREVENTION HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY UNDERFUNDED INSTANCE WHERE COUNTIES HAVE ESTABLISHED A LANDLORD MITIGATION FUND. AND DIVERSION FUNDS HOWEVER WILL ALLOCATIONS TEND TO BE MUCH SMALLER. THAN A LARGER URBAN AREAS WHICH LEAVES LITTLE ON THE TABLE TO YOUR SALAS. PREVENTION ONE ARE LOOKING AT FUNDING YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM. THE MORE EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS. THE LEGISLATURE VISION ABOUT AND HAVE BEEN. SET ASIDES THAT REQUIRED COMMUNITIES MAKE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS AND SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS. YOUTH HOMELESSNESS A STORE NECESSARY- YOU SETASIDES ARE ARE A HUGE STEP TOWARDS CHANGING THE STATE'S LONG HISTORY OF UNDER INVESTMENT IN YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE ROUGHLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH ARE HOMELESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. I THE KINGS TO LARRY C. O. C. RECENTLY PARTICIPATED IN COHORT SIX HUNDRED A CHALLENGE TO ADDRESS YEARS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. THE CHALLENGE TOOK PLACE FROM JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. AND DURING THIS TIME WE HAVE MOST FORTIETH AND LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD THAT WILL LAUNCH IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE'VE USED ARE YOU FUNDING SET ASIDE. TO SET ASIDE BEDS AT NAVIGATION CENTERS BRIDGE HOUSING AND SOME PERMANENT. SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS. ONCE WE HAVE BAD WITH THE TO THE TO POPULAR I'M LOOKING TO. AFTER THE YOUTH ASIDE FUNDS SPENT. DUE TO THE SMALL ALLOCATION OF. THE YOUTH SET ASIDE. THERE YOU KNOW IT'S AN IN A SMALL COMMUNITY LIKE PORTER BELLE. I JUST FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE THAT 8% IS REALLY ONLY ABOUT TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THE ALLOCATION SO OPENING A NEW PROGRAM SPECIFIC TO YOUR- JUST ISN'T REALISTIC WITH THAT SORT OF ALLOCATION. BECAUSE COMPETING PRIORITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO SOLVING HOMELESSNESS. ONE OF THE KEY ROLES THAT THAT THE STATE CAN PLAY AS BY CONTINUING SET ASIDES. THAT REQUIRED OR RESTRICTIONS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT OUR- MENTOR AT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE GAPS IN THEIR LOCAL SYSTEMS. THAT PROTECT UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS LIKE YOUTH. BECAUSE THEY ARE SOMETIMES INVISIBLE COMPARED TO OTHER POPULATIONS. AND IT KEEPS THEM FROM BEING OVERLOOKED ENTIRELY. WHEN IT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO INVEST IN SOLUTION FOR YOU THEY BUILD STRONGER SYSTEMS OF CARE. UNFORTUNATELY FROM TALKING TO SOME OF MY PEERS IN THE FIELD I'VE HEARD THAT THE YOUTH SET ASIDE. WAS AND STILL IS BEING VIEWED AS A FUNDING CEILING RATHER THAN A FUNDING FLOOR- I THINK WITHIN NOT- IN IN PROBABLY MOST CONSISTENTLY IN THE RURAL AREAS- COMMUNITIES ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND SPREAD OUT OVER THREE. TO FIVE EIGHT YEARS DEPENDING ON. HOW EFFICIENT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE. OF GETTING THOSE RESOURCES OUT. AND THAT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS ARE SO VAST IT MAKES IT CHALLENGING TO CREATE TAILORED SOLUTIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU. HARDS UP A PER THAT MEETS THE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE NEEDS OF YOUTH WITHOUT LITTLE FUNDING. ON HOME. FOR THE RURAL COUNTRYSIDE ACADEMIC. WRAP IT UP IN ABOUT A MINUTE IF YOU CAN. YES OF COURSE I KNOW HOME HERE- THE ALLOCATION WAS ONLY ENOUGH TO ACQUIRE. BEING THERE AND PROPERTIES AND NOT ENOUGH. IT'S LIKELY THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO FINISH THE CONVERSIONS ON EITHER OF THE PROPERTY TAX. I'M AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT IN FRESNO COUNTY THEIR THOUSAND OBJECTIONS PENDING AT THE COURTHOUSE. IF THE EVICTION MORATORIUM DOESN'T GET EXTENDED. WE'RE GOING TO FIND A THAT ALL RELATIONS OF PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THOSE ADMISSIONS INCLUDING. YOU SO IT WOULD DEFINITELY THE STATE SHOULD EXTEND ANY LENGTH OF STAY REQUIREMENTS FOR FOLKS. EXITING PROGRAMS DURING THE PANDEMIC. GREAT THANK FOR YOUR TIME. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I KNOW MS MARC HAS TO BY NOON SO THERE ARE ANY. TO OUR FOR BIG GRINS PANEL WANT TO ENTERTAIN THAT AT THIS MOMENT. IF NOT. MISS KOREA CENTER. THANK YOU UP ACTUALLY IT'S- IT COULD BE A QUESTION FOR ALL THREE PANELISTS BUT MY OWN PERSONAL INTERESTS OF COURSES- THE CITY THAT I REPRESENT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY LOS ANGELES BUT I THINK THIS QUESTION SPECIFICALLY IS RELATED TO OUR OUR CURRENT EXPERIENCE IN COVERT NINETEEN AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF- GIVEN THE ROLE OF VARIOUS TENANT PROTECTION POLICIES SUCH AS ADDICTION PROTECTIONS RUNS DEBILITATION AND VARIOUS ANTI DISPLACEMENT STRATEGIES. OTHER THE STATE- IS MOVING FORWARD WITH IN THE PREVENTION OF HOMELESSNESS WHAT WORK DO WE NEED TO DO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE TO STRAIGHTEN THIS THESE KINDS OF POLICIES DO THEY WORK TODAY NOT WORK AND WHAT IS WHAT IS THE CONVERSATION ON THE GROUND AND I APPRECIATE THAT ARE YOU HAVE ALL TOUCHED UPON IT ON VARIOUS DIFFERENT POINTS IN YOUR PRESENTATIONS BUT I THINK THAT WE ARE WE ARE FACING A DIRE SITUATION AND NIGHT I REALLY LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE- WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN DO TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I. JANIE ROWNTREE IS ON THE NEXT PANEL AND SHE WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THIS EVEN MORE THAT I CAN'T BUT WHAT I CAN SAY FROM THE GROUND. IS IN TERMS OF STRENGTHENING THERE'S AN ENFORCEABILITY AFTER THAT BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT AND- WE TEND TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE AND EITHER AS THEY'RE BEING AFFECTED OR THEY'RE AT THEY HAVE LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. AND SO THE WORK TO TRY TO GET THEM CONNECTED TO LEGAL SERVICES AND LEGAL SUPPORT IS ALWAYS A RUSH AT THE LAST MINUTE. SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO THE STRENGTH AND THAT YOU'VE EXTEND MORATORIUM THAT ARE IN PLACE AND MAKE THOSE AND FORCIBLE- WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL AIMED AT. LOWERING THAT AND THEN LOOKING AT LONGER TERM. HOW DO NOT ONLY HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE AFFECTED BECAUSE OF RENT THAT. BACK- IT PEOPLE CAN'T PAY RIGHT NOW IT'S TO. THEM PAY IT INCREASE RENTS. THE MAKE FOR THEIR PAY BUT THEN. HOW TO WE- FIND THE BALLOT BETWEEN. AND THE- I DIDN'T THE LAMB. FULL AND WORK IN THE STATE. AND FOR THE FOR GOVERNMENT AFTER- YOU TO MAKE THAT CALL AND CREATE NUMBER. NOTHING FROM. THAT WE- START FRESH WITH BOTH THEY'RE NOT TO BE OUR RISK OF A FALLING IN. YEAH I- I'M BACK BECAUSE- A WOMAN ISSUE. OUT ACTUALLY KOBE AND WORK THAN WE WERE NORMALLY. I LIKE TO READ. UP MIDWAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU- AND I APPRECIATE A TEST TESTING ESPECIALLY FROM HER I THOUGHT THAT WAS COMPELLED SIX CHARLIE- WHY TO ASK I GUESS I'LL THE LOCALS- WHAT I APPRECIATE ALL Y'ALL'S WORK YOU WHICH ARE THE ONES ON THE GROUND IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS AND REALLY KIND OF ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE- OF THIS EPIDEMIC OF HOME A SECOND EPIDEMIC SO I THINK YOU PROVIDE A REALLY UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE FOR US IS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE BUDGETARY. ISSUES AND CONCERNS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO INVEST AND WHOEVER WANTS TO ADDRESS THIS WOULD BE GREAT- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE YOU ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN COMBATING THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE HE PAP HOME HE- SO WHAT I THINK IS MOST EFFECTIVE- WHICH WHICH OF THE PROGRAMS ARE IT MUST EASIEST TO NAVIGATE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY IN OTHER THINGS- AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE AND I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS BUT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU. DO YOU THINK THE FUNDS THAT WERE PUTTING FORCE- MATCH THE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. SO SORRY FOR ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE THROUGH THIS QUESTIONS THAT WOULD JUST LOVE TO GET YOUR ALSO PERSPECTIVE ON WHOEVER WANTS TO TAKE IT. I'M HAPPY TO GO PERSON THAT THE L. A. PERSPECTIVE. I RIGHT WE GET THE RESTRICTIONS THAT CONGRESS STATE FUNDING DON'T TEND TO BE AS STRINGENT AS WHAT WE SEE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BACK APPRECIATED THE PERSON FLEXIBILITY THERE. WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THE MOST VALUE IN THOSE DOLLARS IS WITHOUT PROBLEM SOLVING RESOURCE THAT I MENTIONED SO. WE SEE AN INCREASED NEED FOR. I THINK THAT IS VERY FLEXIBLE AND NON RESTRICTIVE AND THINK THAT PEOPLE ACT- AND AS A ROOMMATE TO GIVE THAT ONE TIME OR SHORT TERM INTERVENTIONS THAT. RESULT HOMELESSNESS BEFORE PEOPLE LANGUISH FOR TOO LONG IN THE HOME OF THE SIX DOT ORG. HOUSE SO. BRINGING THAT UP WOULD BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND THEN JUST GOING BACK TO PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE'VE MADE BEFORE OR ON THE- ON GOING FUNDING HE FELT. ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO CREATE A LEVEL OF PREDICTABILITY AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS HERE AND ELSEWHERE. ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT LOCAL FUNDING. FOR THE LEAD FROM OUR NONPROFIT PROVIDERS AND OUR PARTNERS. SOME PEOPLE WOULD EVEN PERFORMANCE SPEED DECREASE BUDGET. PREDICTABLE BUT AT- THAT WE COULD THEN BUILD ON OUR ON DEMAND- INCREASE OVER TIME. BUT THE WAR THAT WE CAN PLAN AND BOOK THE- MORE THAT WE CAN GET AWAY. FROM HAVING TO RAMP UP PROGRAMS OF RAMPANT I'M REALLY QUICKLY. THE BETTER BECAUSE WE CAN SEE THAT THE FUNDING IN THE IN FACT THAT YOU DON'T BURGER. SO THE EXAMPLE PRODUCT REVIEW THE PHENOMENAL ONE BECAUSE WE ARE ABLE TO CONVERT A LOT OF THOSE. PROBLEMS HE- AND NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE START UP OFTEN AND ALL THE EFFORT THAT COMES WITH THAT. AND WE ARE ABLE TO KIND OF LEVERAGE. WITH ALREADY. EXISTING AND BILL. WITH YOU AND I DON'T KNOW- PETER TO ME TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT SINCE YOU ARE IN MY CITY LOVE TO SEE IF YOU HAVE A REAL TO THAT IS A- ABSOLUTELY- THANK YOU SOME WITH THEM. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO- TWO THINGS FOR YOU. IN IN. WITH RESPECT. PROGRAMS THAT WE- TO BE. THE MOST AFFECTED- WE- HAVE AS A YOU KNOW IT'S- MEMBER A LARGE. WITH IN CANTON AND STRAY HOME WAS. AND IN OUR EFFORTS. TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE WORST IMPACTS. OF ENCAMPMENTS. BRING PEOPLE INSIDE. WE FOUND THAT SHELTER PROGRAMS AND OTHER INTERN HOUSING PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE VERY LOW BARRIERS TO ENTRY. TEND TO BE THE MOST AFFECTED AND WE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. FOURTEEN IN OAKLAND. FIVE BEING. THE ABILITY TO BRING YOUR HAD. BRING YOUR PARTNER. I'M COMING WITH YOUR PARTNER- HAVE STORAGE FOR YOUR POSSESSIONS. WE WILL BE ABLE TO SLEEP AT EIGHT WITH IT WITH YOUR OWN PRIVACY AT NIGHT SO THOSE FORTIES AT TAX PARTNERS POSSESSIONS IN PRIVACY- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WITH OUR COMMUNITY CABINS PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH HAS A HIGHER UPTAKE RATE IN SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL SHELTON- IN TERMS OF- AS SOME OF THE RED TAPE REDUCTION- PROJECT HOME HE I THINK WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF. WHAT CAN BE DONE WHEN THE STATE WHEN THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PARTNER WITH AN AGGRESSIVE DEADLINE- AND WHEN THE STATE HELPS MOVE AWAY SOME OF THE REGULATORY BARRIERS IN TERMS OF PERMITTING PROCESS THESE OTHER. THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO GET PROJECTS LIKE. WE CAN BE VERY QUICKLY. THREE MONTHS WE OPENED A HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR UNITS THAT- HOUSING. AND I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT TIME IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAPPY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LIKE TO KNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK'S OF- THANK YOU TO THE PRISONERS AND CHARLIE TO- I LIKE SEEING THAT- WELL WE GET TO SEE ALL OF THAT- WORK THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING AT HOME AND A LOT OF IT IS JUGGLING- TEACHING AND BABIES AND SO FORTH- AND I AND I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR JUST THIS INFORMATION OF THE- FOR PEACE THAT THAT IS A VERY GOOD WAY TO BRANDED AND- BUT CERTAINLY IF YOU HAVE WORKED IN. THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY YOU'LL KNOW THAT THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES TO DEAL WITH IT'S EASY TO SAY WHY PEOPLE DON'T GO ON BUT IT'S HARDER TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO GET PEOPLE TO COME IN TO SHELTER SO I APPRECIATE THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I AM. STILL INTERESTED IN IS AS WE LOOK AT THE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED- WE KNOW THAT WE'VE SAID OR HEARD SEVERAL TIMES IS TO KEEP PEOPLE INTO THEIR HOME SO IS THERE ANYBODY ON THE PANEL OR EVEN HERE WITH LISA THAT CAN. ANSWER WHAT PERCENTAGE OF FUNDS DO WE HAVE THAT ARE SIMPLY AVAILABLE FOR IF YOU WANT TO SAY RENTAL ASSISTANCE THAT CAN GET DIRECTLY TO SOMEBODY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT- KEEPING SOMEONE IN THEIR HOME EVEN IF THAT IS RENTAL DIRECT RENTAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE MUCH LESS COSTLY THAN ONCE THEY FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS TRYING TO GET THAT INFECTION OFF THEIR- RECORD TRYING TO GET A FIRST AND- LAST. PAYMENT SO WHAT WHAT TYPE OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE IF WE CAN IN A PERCENTAGE ARE WE ACTUALLY SEEN OUT. OF ALL THE HOUSING DOLLARS OUT THERE. IF ANYBODY KNOWS. ANYONE ON THE PANEL WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. I THINK YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE FIRST TEN DIGITS AWAY KEEP TOP LAWYERS ARE HALF DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE GOING TO SOME SORT OF PERMANENT HOUSING SUBSIDY OPPOSE THAT RICHARD SHELTER. RIGHT OR EVEN COUNTY YOUR BECAUSE WE KNOW MONEY FLOWS FROM THE STATE TO THE COUNTY SOMETIMES TO THE CITIES. AND AGAIN ALL MANY TIMES OR STRINGS ATTACHED SO JUST BEING ABLE TO GET A RENTAL VOUCHER IF YOU WANT TO SAY IS NOT VERY EASY. BUT IF THERE IS THAT TYPE OF FUNDING DO WE HAVE ANY ESTIMATE IS IT IN 1% OF THE TOTAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 5% DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA. YOU CAN LOOK INTO IT FURTHER I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE LA PERSPECTIVE IT IS AT LEAST HALF IF NOT THE MAJORITY OF DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO SOME SORT OF PERMANENT SUBSIDY- WHAT WE TRY TO FIND NOW IS THAT. OFTENTIMES WE NEED SUBSIDIES A LONGER SO THERE'S PEOPLE WHO NEED A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITH FULL WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE CALLED THE PLATINUM- BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO NEED THESE RAPID RE HOUSING SUBSIDIES. FOR MORE THAN THE TWO YEAR TERM THAT THEY'RE OFTEN PROVIDED FORCED TO WORK TRYING TO SUPPLEMENT PATH TO SAY. WE CAN USE THE SCALE APPROACH SO WE MIGHT COVER A SIX MONTHS AND THEN TAILOR IT DOWN OVER TWO THREE FOUR EVEN FIVE YEAR PERIOD. BUT THE GOAL OF BEING A DECREASE ENVESTNET BUT LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY IN HOUSING AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT THAT RISK OF FALLING BACK IN- IT DEGRADES. SO ALMOST CITY BY. UP THE THOSE. IF YOU WANT TO SAY HOW. DEPARTMENTS ARE OR COUNCIL MEMBERS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS DEPENDING ON THEIR CONSTITUENCY. IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF FUNDING SO YOU KNOW FEDERAL FUNDING IS KIND OF DICTATED THE LOCAL FUNDING IS A COORDINATION EFFORT BETWEEN THE PROVIDERS TO SEE- YOU GET A CITY- AND THE COUNTY AND THE STATE DOLLARS ARE SIMILAR IN THAT SENSE TOO SO I WOULD SAY IT'S KIND OF ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I RECALL ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY I WANT TO THANK THE THREE PANELISTS OF FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND- FOR JUGGLING ALL THAT YOU ARE JUGGLING THAT- PRITCHETT YOUR WORK AND LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR THIRD PANEL LET ME INTRODUCE FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE LINE AND JOINING US REMOTELY- DOCTOR BELIEVES ADAMS KELLUM WITH SAINT JOSEPH CENTER CENTER- JANIE ROWNTREE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB AT UCLA DR JONATHAN SHERIN DIRECTOR OF L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND WE ASK THAT EACH PANELIST- KEEP THEIR CALM THERE'RE- INTRODUCTORY INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS TO FIVE MINUTES IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND SO THAT WE CAN GET TO- QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. WE CAN BEGIN WITH THE DOCTOR OF LISA ADAMS KELLUM. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU SOMEONE CARRILLO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO PUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS JOINT HEARING OF YOUR COMMITTEES. I JUST HEARD MY NAME IS DR ALICIA ADAMS CALLUM AND I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO SEEN JUSTICE CENTER. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU TODAY. ST JOSEPH CENTER HAS BEEN WORKING TO ADDRESS POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS IN LOS ANGELES FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. AND TODAY WE REACH MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ANNUALLY OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS ON THE WEST SIDE AND SOUTH LOS ANGELES IN DOWNTOWN LA. AND OUR STAFF WORKED OUT L. A. COUNTY HELPING PEOPLE OVERCOME HOMELESSNESS THE FOUR PILLARS OF OUR WORK OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH. AND EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL SERVICES. ENABLE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY LAUNCHED ITS AD HOC COMMITTEE ON BLACK PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE COMMITTEE WAS CHAIRED BY LOSS OF COMMISSIONER JACQUELYN WAGNER. AND I WAS APPOINTED TO SERVE AS THE WORKGROUP LEAD TO THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS. COMMISSIONER WAGNER IS SORRY THAT SHE'S UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY. ALSO CREATED COMMITTEE IN RECOGNITION OF THE PERSISTENT OVER REPRESENTATION OF BLACK PEOPLE AMONG THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND THESE NUMBERS ARE STARK. IN L. A. COUNTY BLACK PEOPLE REPRESENT JUST 9% OF THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT MAKE UP 35% OF THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. STATEWIDE THE GAP IS EVEN LARGER BLACK PEOPLE ARE JUST SIX POINT 5% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION BUT AGAIN 40% OF THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SADLY THIS SAME DISPROPORTIONATELY IS SEEN ACROSS. THE UNITED STATES. THE COMMITTEE FOUND THAT THIS VAST DISPARITY IS ROOTED IN OUR COUNTRY'S GRAHAM HISTORY OF STRUCTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL RACISM. SUCH TRAGIC TRAGEDIES AS SLAVERY JIM CROW REDLINING AND MASS INCARCERATIONS UNDERMINE THE BLACK COMMUNITY FOR GENERATIONS AND SYSTEMATICALLY PREVENTED BLACK FAMILIES FROM ACCUMULATING RESOURCES. THESE LONGSTANDING DISPARITIES HAVE PLAYED OUT THE PANDEMIC AS WELL WITH TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES AND L. A. COUNTY WE'VE SEEN KOBE NINETEEN IMPACT PEOPLE OF COLOR AT RATES MANY TIMES HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION BOTH IN TERMS OF INFECTION RATES. AND SADLY IT HOLIDAYS ONE AREA OF HOPE HAS BEEN THE PROJECT ROOM KEY AND PROJECT HOME KEY UNLESS HOUSING INITIATIVES THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY. AND THEY WERE FUNDED OF COURSE BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND MANY OF YOU SUPPORTED. AND IT HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER. SO JOSEPH ST PER IN THE EFFORTS A LITTLE YEAR AND WE STOPPED HAND HOW THESE PROGRAMS SAVE LIVES. AS WE LOOK IN THE FUTURE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR A BRIDE REPLICATION OF PROJECT HOME T. AND LOS ANGELES WE APPLIED THE AD HOC COMMITTEE'S FINDINGS AND MADE A COURSE CORRECTION AND HOW WE IMPLEMENTED THIS PROGRAM. WE ENSURE THE PLACEMENTS INTO PROJECT HUNKY MATCH PROPORTIONALLY OUR POPULATION EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE URGE YOU NOW TO MANDATE THIS APPROACH STATEWIDE BY DIRECTING THAT RESOURCES BE ALLOCATED SPECIFICALLY TO THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY HOMELESSNESS WITH THEM I TO ADDRESSING THE DISPROPORTIONATE ALITY. AMONG BLACK PEOPLE THAT I HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE THEIR LEADERSHIP AND SPEARHEADING AB SEVENTY ONE THE CITY AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES HAVE BOTH TAKEN A POSITION TO pCENTER JOIN WITH OTHERS IN THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY. ADVOCATE FOR IT AS WELL SUSTAINABLE RELIABLE RESOURCES MATTER AS% YOU'VE HEARD AS AB SEVENTY ONE MAKES CLEAR AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE RECENT STATE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING AND SERVICES ONE TIME FUNDING TAKES ABOUT MINISTRY TO TIME AND RESOURCES TO PREPARE FOR NEW PROGRAMS AND THE ONE TIME NATURE OF THE FUNDING LIMITS. WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THOSE FUNDS AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE EARLY ENDORSERS OF THE BRING CALIFORNIA HOME CAMPAIGN WHICH WILL ALSO PROVIDE ON GOING FUNDING FOR EVIDENCE BASED MODELS I'VE TALKED ABOUT. FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO FULLY BENEFIT FROM THESE RESOURCES WE MUST MAKE AN INVESTMENT PROPORTIONAL TO THE PRESENT AND HOUSE COMMUNITY AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT THE SERVICES THEY RECEIVE. ARE TRAUMA INFORMED AND CULTURALLY TAILORED BEARING THAT IN MIND WE ARE REQUESTING A CAR ABOUT A DEDICATED FUNDING FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SERVICES THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE NEED TO FIND HOUSE BLACK PEOPLE. ANOTHER THING THAT THE. AD HOC COMMITTEE LEARNED IS THAT BLACK SINGLE DAHLE. ART AS LIKE TO FALL OUT HOW. AS THEIR WHITE AND LATINO CONTENT. WELL BLANCA ARE TO AS LIKE TO FALL OUT OF HOW. COMPARED TO WHAT AND LYFT FAN. THIS SERVICE THAT CAN HELP COUNTER THESE TRENDS INCLUDE ACADEMIC SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN MENTAL HEATH TREATMENT ACCESS TO FOOD AND HEALTH CARE LOCATIONAL TRAINING AND MANY OTHERS. THE COMMITTEE ALSO FOUND WHO PROVIDES THESE CRUCIAL SERVICES MATTERS AS WELL. THROUGH HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF LISTENING SESSIONS WE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS CLIENTS CURRENTLY RECEIVING SERVICES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEIR INPUT WAS UNANIMOUS. HIRING PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS WEBER CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE LANDS TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS. OF THE BLACK PEOPLE WE ARE SERVING THUS IT IS VITAL THAT WE EARMARKED DOLLARS FOR HIRING AND TRAINING OF INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERTISE TO DELIVER TROM INFORMED. CULTURALLY TAILORED HOUSING RETENTION SERVICES. IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO SAY IN THIS TIME WHEN SO MANY ARE CALLING FOR JUSTICE WE MUST ADOPT POLICIES THAT INCREASE EQUITY. BY APPLYING A DATA DRIVEN EQUITY LENS TO ENSURE THE TARGETED PROPORTIONAL IMPACT OF HOMELESS RESOURCES CALIFORNIA CAN ONCE AGAIN LEAD THE WAY AND INSPIRE OTHER. STATES THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU DR ADAMS COLUMN I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE IN TERMS OF THE REGIONAL APPROACH AND THE EQUITY APPROACH IN TERMS OF ARE MOST IMPACTED AND BEING FROM LOS ANGELES. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE ARE MOVINGON TO OUR NEXT PANELIST- AND AGAIN I ASK IF YOU CAN PLEASE. BE CONCISE WITH FIVE MINUTES SO THAT WE CAN GET TO QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM THE MEMBERS- IS AND CHENEY ROWNTREE ON THE LINE. YES I'M HERE GREAT THANK YOU YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB AT UCLA. EPL THE NONPARTISAN RESEARCH LAB BASED AT UCLA AND UC BERKELEY WE DEVELOP INTENSIVE PARTNERSHIPS RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND CALIFORNIA AND HAVE OVER TWO DOZEN PARTNERSHIPS. I'M CURRENTLY AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL AND I'M GOING TO FOCUS TODAY ON OUR RESEARCH ON HOMELESSNESS IN LOS ANGELES. WE HAVE HEARD POLICY LAB WORKS WITH ADMINISTRATIVE DATA FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AND SEIZE THE HOMELESS POPULATION DOCUMENTED NOT ONLY BY LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY SERVICE RECORDS. BUT ALSO BY SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AND HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. USING ALL OF THESE DATA WE SEE THAT IN ANY GIVEN YEAR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND UNIQUE SINGLE ADULTS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AND LOS ANGELES THIS NUMBER IS QUITE A BIT LARGER THAN THE PIT COUNT BECAUSE IT IS AN ANNUAL ESTIMATE OF UNIQUE PEOPLE AND NOT A SNAPSHOT. ON ONE EVENING. IT'S POPULATION IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE WITH VERY DIFFERENT PATHWAYS INTO HOMELESSNESS EXPERIENCES AND NEEDS. SO TODAY I WANT TO GIVE YOU THREE DATA POINTS FROM ARE COMPLETED AND ALSO FROM I'M GOING ON PUBLISHED RESEARCH AND TALK ABOUT HOW EACH OF THESE DATA POINTS CONNECTS TO THE STATE'S ROLE. IN RESPONDING TO HOMELESSNESS. I WANT TO START BY TALKING ABOUT ARGUABLY THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY UNSHELTERED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IN RECENT YEARS LOS ANGELES HAS GREATLY EXPANDED OF STREET OUTREACH SERVICES. AND IN A RECENT YEARS RETIREES WORKERS WERE IN CONTACT WITH JUST UNDER THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. WE WENT TO THE STREET ARE REACHED RECORDS TO CLINICAL DATA PROVIDED BY THE L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. AND FOUND THAT HAVE A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS THIS YEAR IS MENTAL ILLNESS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FINDING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT RELY ON SURVEYS OR SELF REPORTED INFORMATION WHICH CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY WELL. ALSO 20% IS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE AS MANY AS THREE HOURS CLIENTS MIGHT BE UNDIAGNOSED OR COULD HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED BY ANY AGENCY OTHER THAN THE OUR MENTAL HEALTH. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING AND HOUSING SUBSIDIES TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS ARE ALSO SUFFERING FROM SEVERE CONDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT IN HOUSING ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM THEY WILL NEED ACCESS TO RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES SOMETIMES CALLED BOARDING CARE. UNLIKE MOST SHELTER STAFF THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES CAN ADMINISTER MEDICATION AND MONITOR AND HANDLE BASIC NEEDS ON A TWENTY FOUR HOUR BASIS. EITHER CRUCIAL RESOURCES THEY ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO ENCAMPMENTS AND THE MOST SICK THESE FUNCTIONAL INDIVIDUALS LIVING ON OUR STREETS. YES THEY ARE CLOSING DUE TO FUNDING GAPS IN A LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES. THE STATE COULD PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN SHORING UP OPERATING FUNDING AND EXPANDING THE AVAILABLE BEDS. IN RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. I WANT TO TALK NEXT ABOUT OUR RESEARCH INTO RACIAL DISPARITIES IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. YOU ARE WORK WITH THE AADHAAR COMMITTEE ON BLACK PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE FOUND AND FURTHER REFINES ARE FINDING THAT A BLACK CLIENTS REPLACING THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR NEARLY 40% MORE LIKELY TO RETURN HOMELESSNESS. I CLIENTS IN OUR FOLLOW UP RESEARCH WHICH WILL BE RELEASED LATER THIS YEAR THE KEY DRIVERS OF RACIAL DISPARITIES APPEAR TO BE THE TYPE AND QUALITY OF HOUSING AVAILABLE TO BLACK CLIENTS THE INTENSITY OF SERVICES CASE MANAGER TURNOVER OR SMALL CITY CONCERNS AND WEBER DISCRIMINATION- INTERVIEWS AND DATA ANALYSIS A STARK PICTURE IS EMERGING. BLACK CLIENTS EXPERIENCE WORSE OUTCOMES IN PART BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF HOUSING AND SERVICES THAT HAPPEN TO BE AVAILABLE TO THEM WHERE THEY AT WHERE THEY ARE HOMELESS. THIS IS STRUCTURAL RACISM AND ANY OF ITS STRUCTURAL SOLUTION. THE STORE A FEDERAL AND OCCASIONALLY STATE FUNDING IS PRIORITIZE FOR HOUSING SUBSIDIES IN HOUSING UNITS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFITS ARE LEFT TO FILL THE GAPS- SERVICES AND FOR OPERATING EXPENSES FOR OUR NON PROFIT PROVIDER BASED. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AN UNDERINVESTMENT IN THE SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE IS CONTRIBUTING A RACIAL DISPARITIES. H. SHOULD CONSIDER STABLE FUNDING. FUNDING SOURCES FOR SERVICES. AND CLEARLY WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THE INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT AGAINST DISCRIMINATORY HOUSING PRACTICES. FINALLY I WANT TO END BY TALKING ABOUT SINGLE ADULTS WERE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS FOR THE FIRST TIME. I STARTED TALKING ABOUT CHRONICALLY HOMELESS WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT 50% OF SINGLE ADULTS INVOLVED IN HOW THE SERVICES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A GIVEN YEAR I'VE NO PRIOR SERVICE HISTORY WITH THE COUNTY. THAT MEANS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS INCARCERATED IN THE JAIL TREATED FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OR ENROLLED IN SAFETY NET PROGRAMS IN FACT WE MERGED STATE EMPLOYMENT RECORDS TO HOMELESS SERVICES RECORDS WE LEARNED THAT 47% OF PEOPLE ENROLLED IN HOMELESS SERVICES IN LOS ANGELES WE'RE WORKING IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN. TWO YEARS OF THE HOMELESS. THE HALF OF THE- SINGLE ADULT DO YOU SERVICE. OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT L. A. COUNTY AND CITY COULD POTENTIALLY PREVENT THESE INFLOWS BEFORE THEY OCCUR. AND COLLECTION LHASA WE ARE DEVELOPING A PURELY VALID SURVEY THAT CAN BE USED IN THE FIELD TO SCREEN PEOPLE SEEKING PREVENTION WHICH IS TYPICALLY A ONE TIME CASH ASSISTANCE. WE'VE ALSO DEVELOPED PREDICTIVE MODELS TO HELP L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENTS IDENTIFY CURRENT CLIENTS YOUR TIRE IS GOOD POLICY THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING AND PREVENTION PILOT. LED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES. THE GOAL IS TO REACH PEOPLE OF UNITS. HOUSING AND CERTAINLY BEFORE THEY'RE ON THE STREET WHERE THEY ARE HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. I'VE GIVEN THREE DATA POINTS TODAY THAT IF YOU'RE DISCONNECTED AND I'M RELATED TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY ARE NOT THEY REFLECT THE DIVERSITY AMONG THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND THE NEED TO FIND A WIDE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE TO RESIST CHARACTERIZING THE HOMELESS CRISIS AS ONLY ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS ARE ONLY ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ARE ONLY ABOUT POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT. THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT SUCH AN HEARING HERE. WE NEED A HARD RANGE. OF SOLUTIONS. AND THE COURAGE AND IMAGINATION TO PURSUE THEM. OUR RESEARCH ALSO CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THE NEED TO INVEST IN SERVICES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS IN ADDITION TO HOUSING. I DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT A RESURGENCE OF THE ONLY HOMELESSNESS BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THAT TOPIC THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU MISS MISS ROWNTREE I WOULD ACTUALLY WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ON FAMILY HOMELESSNESS- YOU KNOW. PERHAPS A AND- WHEN WE HAVE MORE MORE TIME- DURING THE Q. AND THE Q. AND A OF THIS PANEL BUT I THINK THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING TOPIC IN TERMS OF KEEPING THE FAMILY TOGETHER AND KEEP THE FAMILY UNIT. OF SAFE. OUR NEXT PANELIST IS DOCTOR JOHNSON SHARON- WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH DR SHARON ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU YOU MAY BEGIN. OKAY YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE STATE FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS DOING ALL THE ATTENTION. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THIS COMMITTEE AND YOU. BY CHAIRMAN TRIO FOR INVITING ME- YOU KNOW. I COME TO YOU AS A DIRECTOR OF THIS- MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO AS THE STREETS ARE CATCHERS- AND YOU KNOW CLEARLY THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING. ISSUE OF DEMAND AND THERE'S A OVERWHELMING NEED TO DEVELOP CAPACITY BUT- HOW WE DO THAT IS CRITICAL AND IT MUST BE DRIVEN. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- AT THE GROUND LEVEL FROM THE GROUND UP- AND WE NEED TO LOOK TOWARD DESIRED OUTCOMES. ALWAYS BUT WHEN WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND I. I YOU KNOW I'M I'M HAPPY TO BE FOLLOWING DR ROWNTREE WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES I THINK IN A SOPHISTICATED WAY WHETHER WE- COMBAT. I'M IT HOMELESSNESS IS NOT ONE THING- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TICKET COUNTER. AND THE PECAN IS- IN MY OPINION A VERY DAHLE. BLUNT TOOL- IT DOESN'T EVEN ADDRESS THINGS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE RECIDIVISM ARE PEOPLE FALLING IN AND OUT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE LOSING THAT BATTLE OF. INVERSES OUT BUT ARE THEY RECIDIVISTS- THERE WERE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS EARLIER THAT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO ASKING ABOUT GAP ANALYSIS- AND YOU KNOW IT AND. I'M WORKING CAREFULLY WITH THE A CALIFORNIA POLICY LED TO DRESS THESE ISSUES- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS I'M VERY BIASED I FOCUS ON THOSE WHO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE- OF THEIR CONDITION. AND WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT IS NOT. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IT SAID BUT IT IS A GROUP THAT NEEDS VERY VERY FOCUSED EFFORT AND FLEXIBLE I'M GOING FUNDS BEYOND WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND WE HAVE TO THINK IN A COMPLIMENTARY FASHION. AMONGST THE DIFFERENT GROUPS ABOUT HOW WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR THE COLLECTED NEEDS TO BE COORDINATED VERY VERY WELL I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PRIORITY FOR LASSA. I'M AND THE LOCAL REALITY HERE IS THAT IT'S GETTING WORSE. I'M WE HAVE DEVELOPED OF A SPECIFIC TEAM THE WHOLE THE HOME TEAM WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SEVERE PERSISTENT. NOW ILL. I'M AND I'M TRYING TO GET THE NOT ONLY DOING THOSE. WHO ARE SO DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE BUT ALSO TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT'S OUT THERE. IN COLLABORATION WITH- THE POLICY LAB. AND I WILL SAY THAT HERE'S PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE ARE A HUGE PART OF THAT EFFORT AND NEED TO BE. I'M GOING. WITH RESPECT TO RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED. THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL THING BUT I AM A STRONG BELIEVER BECAUSE PEOPLE FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND DUE TO THE TRAUMA DEVELOP. MENTAL ILLNESS TO BECOME MY CUSTOMER THAT WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET. AND THERE I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HOUSING OR SHELTER IT'S ABOUT COMMUNITY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE MILITARY WHEN WE DEPLOY. HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF MILITARY MEMBERS ARE PUT INTO DIGNIFIED WELL RESOURCE COMMUNITIES. DON'T WAKE. AND HAVE THE ARE. WITH PROPERTIES LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN MY OPINION TO TAKE THAT APPROACH AND BRING PEOPLE FROM TRAUMATIZING ENVIRONMENTS TO COMMUNITY EVEN IF IT'S- IN. COMMUNITY I WILL ALSO SAY THAT- ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE FUNDING YES PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS GREAT AND THERE'S TONS OF DATA TO SUGGEST THAT IT IS. THE SOLUTION FOR DECADES BEHIND IT'S GOING TO TAKE DECADES TO GET CAPACITY. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHEN IT COMES TO BRING CALIFORNIA HOME NO PLACE LIKE HOME MONEY AND I'VE HAD MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT NO PLACE LIKE HOME WITH ALL STEINBERG- OFF AUTHORED AT. ANY TO SAY ABOUT THE FACT THAT THAT FUNDING AUDIT NOT JUST BE. USED FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND FOR NEW PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS BOARDING CARE NEEDS TO NOT ONLY BE SAVED BUT EXPANDED IN THAT BUSINESS MODEL MUST BE FIXED. AND IT NEEDS ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL STREAMS OF MONEY AND I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE MANY MANY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE- BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES THAT ARE BEING LIBERATED I BELIEVE AS WE DEVELOP NEW MODELS FOR HOW WE CONDUCT. OUR BUSINESS ARE THE MALLS ARE THE DEPARTMENTS LIKE MINE THEY DON'T NEED THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE GOING TO CONSIDER HOW TO USE IT AS- PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS KEY AND THEN LASTLY I WILL SAY THAT THE ANSWER IS NOT JUST ABOUT HOUSING PEOPLE IT'S ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT SO DISABLED THAT THAT'S WHY THEY FALL OUT NEED OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DR TURN I'M GONNA OPEN IT UP TO THE MEMBERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKING. YEAH THANK YOU. AMAZON YES. OKAY I JUST WANT TO ALL THOSE WHO IMPORT THUS FAR AND FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AND I- I RESPECT AND APPRECIATE THE FINANCIAL COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE MADE AS A STATE AS A COUNTRY AND AS A COMMUNITY IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND I AGREE THAT- WE NEED A WIDE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS AS MISS ROWNTREE SUGGESTED BUT- I BELIEVE VERY VERY FORCEFULLY THAT THE EFFICACY. OF THE ALLOTTED TAXPAYER FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED. UNLESS WE SERIOUSLY TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES OF TWO MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS. NOT BEING ADDICTION AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND I BELIEVE IT'S SO LARGE THAT WE NEED TO PARTNER WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THE CREATING A STRATEGY AND IDENTIFYING AND SERVING PEOPLE WITH THESE DIFFICULT. CONDITIONS AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER LOOKING SOME MEMBERSHIP. THANK YOU I JUST WANNA RESPONDED LAST FOUR IN SAYING THAT. BUT MANY OF US AGREE ABSOLUTELY WITH HER PAW THAT WE'VE TO INTEGRATE LOTS DIFFERENCES THAT ARE SIDE. WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS- SUCH AS ABOUT. IT'S BEEN HEALTH IT'S FROM JUSTICES AND MANY OF SYSTEMS ARE PER THAT LET COMMENT ON A NUMBER OF YOU THIS A RELIEF. PANEL ON IN A PRE. THE THAT HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF YOU A DIFFERENT TIME OF TOUCH. ISSUES OF RACIAL EQUITY AND CERTAIN HEARD THIS A FOR OUT HOW TO FIND. MORE TO ADDRESS THIS MORE BROADLY BUT LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS IF BEEN. IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE ON HOW TO THE HISTORICAL AND ONGOING LIKE OF RACE- MY STAFF AND I WE'VE BEEN KICKED AROUND OF IDEA IN THE SPACE BUT- YOU ARE. AND IT'S LOVE THOUGHTS HOW WE CAN. REALLY VERY SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS OUR HISTORY OF THIS. IMPACT OF PASSED INVOLVED. IN ADDITION. DID YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT FIRST NIGHT COMBAT UP. I'M I'M I'M HAPPY TO I'M GONNA DO A EAR DOCTOR CAL HAS THE ACCESS BETTING. I MENTIONED IN PASSING THAT- JUST IT'S- IMPORTANT THAT WE IN. ON AND THAT'S- INTO OF THEIR HOUSING. NOT THAT A MAJOR IT HI COMMITTEE REPORT I DO IT'S AN GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSED BUDGET I NOT MISTAKEN- AND THEN I'LL JUST GO. INTENTIONS BY INDIVIDUALS BUT THEY ADD UP TO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENT FACTS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DISPARATE IMPACTS IN LOS ANGELES YOU REALLY SEE THAT. ENTIRE COMMUNITIES NOT JUST CLIENTS BUT ALSO THE NONPROFIT SERVICE PROVIDER BASED. DO YOU HAVE THE FUNDING AND RESOURCES. TO MAINTAIN PERSONALITY AFRICAN HEAD OF SALARIES TO CASE MANAGER WORDS- TO SHORE UP THEIR OPERATING COSTS IF YOU EXPECT YOUR NONPROFIT. PROVIDER BASED CONSTANTLY. FIND REYES. OR COSTS THEN YOU START TO DISPARITY AND THEY WERE ALL UP INDUSTRY THIS. IN- IMPACT. LOCK QUITE WHO ARE HOME SO. I'VE MY REMARKS. HOW TO AFFECTED THAT WE SEE IN THE HOMELESS SYSTEM AND ALL ALL MAYBE LIKE DR OUT ON TALK ABOUT OF THE DRAW- INSTANCE OF THE HOW. FAR PEOPLE END UP BEING AT HIGHER RISK OF AND THE FIRST PLACE. THANK YOU IN THE YOU MAKE A PLAY. ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE- PAY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO. PROPERTY IN. WHO WOULD BE HAPPY IN MANY HAVE A THERE'S I WAS IN AVAILABLE TO. I'M HOW BLACK PEOPLE IN PEOPLE OF COLOR VOTE NEED. OFTEN TO THOSE NEED THE AND THEY- AND I IMPRESSED. INVEST IN ORDER TO. BE TO HIGH. AND TO GET. AND BE A PART OF THE CITY THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS PAY. ON TIME AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO SEE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN WHO IS SHELTERING AND SERVING. WHEN IT GETS TO THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT THERE IS DISPARITY OF INVESTMENT IN A BLACK COMMUNITIES AND THAT DOES IMPACT. STRUCTURES IN NON PROFITS AND AGENCIES. THAT ARE ON THE- FRONTLINE OF. TO THE NEED OF BLACK PEOPLE. AND IF WE DON'T BASS. AT COULD IN THOSE AND IN THOSE AGENCIES YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE FOLKS WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM WITH A CULTURAL LANDS I'LL BE AVAILABLE TO SERVE WE REALLY MUST CHANGE SOME OF THE STRUCTURES IN THE WAYS THAT MONIES ARE ACCESSED AND I THINK IT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE DECISION MAKER. WE NEED BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AT THE TABLE NOT JUST REPRESENTING AN AREA ARE BEING AT FILLING A SEAT BUT HAVING DECISION MAKING POWER AND AUTHORITY AND WE NEED TO SEE THAT ACROSS BOARDS IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR AND AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF AGENCIES THAT MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHERE RESOURCES WILL BE INVESTED AND THAT ALSO MEANS WE NEED TO BE HIRING PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE. PROVIDING TRAINING AND HAVE ONGOING INVESTMENT IN SUPPORT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS AND NOT TO MENTION THE OVER REPRESENTATION OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED YOUNG KIDS WERE NOT GETTING ADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE A GREATER GAP WE KNOW DO Và C. AND SOME OF THOSE INVEST THAT WE NEED TO MAKE UPSTREAM THE OVER REPRESENTATION OF BLACK KIDS ARE IN FOSTER CARE THEN FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS ONCE THE EMANCIPATE AND YOU CAN SEE THE TRAJECTORY ON AND ON- OVER THE YEARS THAT THAT STARTS TO CREATE THAT TERRIBLE GAP- THAT KEEPS BLACK PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO COMPETE. AND HAVING. EQUAL ACCESS TO RESOURCES IF I'M THIS THIS IS- JOHN I AYE WHY IT YOU KNOW ECHOED SOME OF THESE HIS POOR I THINK THERE. TO WAY WE- IS CRITICAL AND THE VOICE. IS CRITICAL THE WAY WE LEVERAGE PEOPLE OF THE NEXT I SAW BEFORE. IS A HUGE. PART OF THE SO BUT ONE OF THE THAT I LEAD WITH IS ISSUE THAT WE DO RE UNDER. EXACTLY WHAT'S OUT THERE WITH NEARLY THE LEVEL SOPHISTICATION THAT WE NEED AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OUTCOMES BASED ON WHAT'S THERE AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE OUTCOMES OF THE OUTCOMES FOCUS ON GROUPS THAT WE WANT. TO FOCUS ON BASED ON VULNERABILITY BASED ON HISTORIES OF TRAUMA BASED ON CONDITION THEN WE WILL DRIVE THE FUNDING TO ACHIEVE THOSE OUTCOMES. THANK YOU FOR THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SILVA. THANK YOU AND AGAIN I WANT THANK ALL OF THE- OF THE FROM I THINK CONGRESS I- I. WISH THAT WE WERE NOT IN A PEN SO WE COULD. ALL OF OUR- STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN HERE AND IN PERSON. SOME OF THE BIG THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD- PARTICULARLY UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH PART IS UP WE FIRST KNOW THAT AS WE SEPARATE OUR HEALTH SYSTEM- FROM OUR MENTAL HEALTH. WE START TO GET THESE NAVIGATION ISSUES AND I KNOW FOR HOMELESS IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY WHO'S ALREADY STRUGGLING. AND THEN ASKING THEM TO NAVIGATE NOT ONLY A HOUSING- OPPORTUNITIES BUT MENTAL HEALTH WE LOSE MANY PEOPLE RIGHT THERE THEY SIMPLY. EVEN JUST TO GET AROUND FROM ONE BUILDING TO ANOTHER BECOMES VERY YEAR- BUT AGAIN AS A BROKEN RECORD I DO WANT TO. SAY TO THOSE OUT THERE THAT I RAN A BILL LAST YEAR THAT WAS SIGNED AND THAT WAS TO CLARIFY THAT MHS FUNDS CAN BE USED NOT ONLY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT ALSO FOR ADDICTION AS WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE CO OCCURRING SOMETIMES AND- THAT WE CAN NOT BE PUSHING. ARE A PATIENTS FROM ONE BUILDING TO ANOTHER IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY. THEY NEED TO GET HOME CARE AT ANOTHER AREA THAT I'M REALLY REALLY HOPING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON. BEYOND I REALLY THINK THAT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO- AND I SAID IT AT THE BEGINNING SO I'LL JUST AND THEN WRAP UP HERE. IS AFTER THIS PANDEMIC WHICH WE KNOW IS IN SIGHT- IT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S SIX MONTHS OR EVEN A YEAR. WE HAVE PUT IN MANY STRUCTURES FOR COVE AND WHETHER IT'S PROJECT ROOM KEY WHETHER IT'S AGAIN THAT TEMPORARY MOBILE HOUSING UNITS WHETHER IT'S TENSE WHETHER IT'S HYGIENE STATIONS. AND THOSE NEED TO REMAIN SO MY PLEA OUT THERE IS TO ANYBODY WHO'S WATCHING IT THAT ARE ON THE HOUSING COUNCILS THAT ARE WORKING WITH MENTAL HEALTH THAT ARE WORKING WITH HOUSING. THOSE NEED TO REMAIN INTEL WE ARE IN A PLACE TO BUILD BACK THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING UNITS THAT WE NEED- SO EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TEMPORARY WE NEED TO CONTINUE THOSE AFTER WE START TO SEE KOBE. DWINDLE BECAUSE AS WAS NOTED BY DR JONATHAN SURE AND WE'VE GOT TO GET PEOPLE OUT FROM THE ELEMENTS WHETHER IT'S THE HEAT OR THE COLD. WE KNOW THAT JUST CHRONICALLY ENDS PEOPLE'S LIVES JUST FROM BEING OUT IN THE ELEMENTS LASTLY I'LL. JUST SAY RIGHT HERE AT OUR CAPITAL. BECAUSE OF KOBE HIM TO OF ALL THE THINGS HAPPEN- THERE'S A LOT OF SECURITY SO PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENTERING THIS BUILDING- DON'T HAVE THAT ACCESS AND I KNOW FOR SURE. BECAUSE I WALK HERE THAT THERE ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT HAVE LIVED ON OUR PART BROWN'S THAT LIVE AROUND THE CAPITAL AND NOW WE'RE LOCKED OUT AND- THIS IS THE SAME THING I GO BACK TO WHICH IS WE HAVE BIG THINGS TO DO. BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE LITTLE THINGS SO I WOULD SAY THESE HYGIENE STATIONS THESE BATHROOMS. WE NEED THOSE AND WE NEED THEM NOW BUT I THANK YOU FOR THIS VERY ROBUST PANEL FOR THESE EXPERTS THAT I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING TIRELESSLY AND FOR. OUR CHAIR. CHAIRS AT MADAM CHAIR AND- MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. CONVERSATIONS THAT WE CAN BE HAVING. THANK YOU. IT I TRULY CARILLO APOS TO MAKE IT QUICK COME AB DOCTOR SHARE PLEASE. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY FOR- YOU KNOW HOW TO CLARIFY THAT THE USE OF- INTEGRATED FOR INTEGRATED YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO. I TO COME ABILITIES WHAT ALSO WOULD THREE. TO LIVING CAN. AND THE TRAUMA BECOMING HOMELESS IS THAT YOU KNOW AS I SAID BEFORE I JUST WANT TO REINFORCE. IT'S DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ENGAGE PEOPLE ON THE SIDEWALK IN THE STREET IN CAMDEN. BUT IF WE CAN CREATE. TEMPORARY COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE. IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE. WHERE- YOU KNOW. INDIVIDUALS CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE STREETS STILL BE HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY'RE IN AN INTERIM SETTING IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION IS GOING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH. PUBLIC SAFETY WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS OR OTHERWISE NOT ENGAGED WILL MUCH MORE EASILY AND I THINK WHEN WE FOCUS- SO HEAVILY ON PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN THE MIDST OF A- TRUE HUMANITARIAN- CRISIS. THAT WE MISSED THAT THERE ARE TWO MANY PEOPLE HOMELESS FOR US NOT TO CREATE INTERIM SOLUTIONS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY ROBUST AND I. RETURNED TO MY COMMENT ABOUT THE MILITARY AND HOW THEY STAND UP LARGE INTENTIONAL WELL ORGANIZED SAFE CLEAN COMMUNITIES IN VERY SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. BUT NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE BUILT FROM GROUND UP WE CAN TAKE. BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN USED BEFORE AND WE HAVE THEM. BUT WE HAVE TO GET MOVING WE I JUST DREAD THE IDEA OF HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS YEAR AFTER YEAR MONTH AFTER MONTH- WE'VE MADE PROGRESS SO THANK YOU TO THE- PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE ON THE FRONT LINES BUT WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I ALSO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL BUT BEFORE. I PROCEED WITH WITH THE QUESTIONS I DO WANT TO INFORM FOLKS ARE TRYING TO GET ON THE LINE THAT WE ARE HAVING SOME. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED AT THE MOMENT AND AS SOON AS I HAVE AN UPDATE FOLLOWING. UP A FEW MORE MINUTES WITH Q. AND NAY I WILL ANNOUNCE THAT AS WELL SO JUST HOLD TIGHT AS US WE TRY TO RESOLVE. OF ISSUES WITH THE PHONE LINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. SO DR SHARING I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR YOUR COMMENTS ON. EXPEDITING AND THE SERIOUSNESS AND URGENCY OF THE ISSUE AND THE COMPARISON TO MILITARY OPERATIONS. CAN YOU PLEASE SHARE AND REALLY IT'S A IT'S A QUESTION FOR FULL ARE FOR ALL THREE PANELISTS BUT IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WE'VE SPOKEN BEFORE ABOUT THE BUREAUCRACY OF BEING ABLE TO MOVE WITH URGENCY CAN YOU PLEASE SHARE WITH US WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT MAYBE THE STATE CAN DO TO. REMOVE SOME OF THAT RED TAPE THAT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE COUNTIES TO MOVE AS QUICKLY OR WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BUREAUCRACIES EVEN WITHIN THE COUNTY THE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR ASSISTANCE TO MOVE AT THE LEVEL OF URGENCY THAT IT NEEDS TO MOVE THAT. AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP. THANK YOU- AND I. I'LL I'LL GET STARTED I'M SURE MY- FELLOW PANELISTS HAVE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS TOO I MEAN I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT- OUTCOMES BEING- THE DRIVER BASED ON THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND FLEXIBILITY WITH OUR RESOURCES IS CRITICAL CHIEF US OUT. YOU KNOW IT THERE IS A EXAMPLE. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. YOU KNOW IT. IT'S GOT THESE POCKETS OF FUNDS THE FUNDS ARE KIND OF CONSTRAINED IT. AND WHAT ABOUT THEY DO IN. I CAN I WILL I WITH WITH THAT SO. THAT. I'M STEINBERG A LOT ON ON HOW TO DO A RE. COMMENT BLOCK. BUT BUT WE NEED TO DO IS NEED TO SEE ARE THE OUT WE WANT ACHIEVE A THAT RESEARCH. AND THEN LET THEM- YOU KNOW- JURISDICTIONS SHE THOSE GOALS. AND IT WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT DONE WE WANT BE A CHILD. THOSE ARE WANT TO BE CAN TO PROCESS OR TO BE A CAN. TO YOU KNOW I. YOU KNOW CHEATING GOALS FOR SPECIFIC POPULAR A LOT OF WHAT HAVING IN THE STATE. OBVIOUSLY THESE KIDS BY THE AND I WE SAY THAT CALAIS. IS MOVING IN AND- AT DIRECTION. YOU KNOW BUT THIS TIME ARE THINGS THAT THE STATE IS. I AM. MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THIS OR REALLY SO. REQUIRE LONG TERM. I TREAT. IN LOCKING UNLOCK SAID ME I. X. I DOESN'T ALLOW TO PAY FOR THAT. SO WE ASKED FOR A WAIVER WE'RE WORKING THE FEDERAL. YOU IN SHE- BUT THAT'S SOME THAT'S BEEN A- TO THE STATE OVER YOU AND A HALF. I'M A WHAT I'M SAY TO YOU IS. WE NEED FLEX. WITH OUR FUNDS AND WE NEED TO BE ASKED AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN OUTCOMES I WOULD LOVE IT IF I. TEAM. WAS CHARGED TO GO. AND FIND OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PROFOUND MENTAL HISTORY IN THE STREET. AND THE DECREASE THAT NUMBER AND TRACK IT. ABOUT PERCENT EVERY EVERY YEAR- AND THAT'S WHAT I DO IT'S NOT- IT'S YES THAT'S DOLLARS YOU CAN DO YOU FOR THIS. THAT'S YEAH SORTS. YOU KNOW WITH THEM. ARE ON MEDICARE AND LOCAL MATCH AS WELL. THANK YOU DOCTOR. ARE OR IS THERE AND MARK COMING TO FROM THE PEN. NO NOT AT THIS TIME. I GUESS AS A SERVICE PROVIDER I WOULD JUST SAY. THAT THERE ARE SOMETIMES BARRIERS TO FULLY UTILIZING RESOURCES WE USE A BLEND OF FUNDING MODEL AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY ASKING OURSELVES CAN WE USE THIS FOR THIS AND THAT AND THE FLEXIBILITY. AND MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN OF COURSE YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY HOW MUCH WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE. BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS- APPROACH OF A BINARY. WAY OF LOOKING AT HOMELESSNESS AND HOMELESS SERVICES. I THINK WE CAN SAY WE JUST NEED PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR WE JUST NEED IN TERM WE NEED BOTH WE ARE IN A CRISIS- PROJECT ROOM KEY. SHOWED US HOW RESPONSIBLE YOU CAN BE IN A CRISIS HOW WE CAN MOVE ON A DIME SUGGESTS CENTER OPENED UP. A COUPLE OF HOTELS IN WEEKS WE CAN DO MORE AND MORE THERE'S MANY UNDER UTILIZED- PARKING LOTS BUSINESSES WAREHOUSES AND I THINK WE JUST. HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD IN USING THOSE UNDER UTILIZED SPACES FOR THE GOOD AND TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS WE REALLY. I AM A CHAMPION OF A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I BELIEVE IN HOUSING CARS AND I KNOW THAT THAT IS THE SOLUTION HOMELESSNESS BUT I'M ALSO SEEING. OUR BLACK AND BROWN BROTHERS ARE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS DYING ON THE STREETS EVERY DAY AND WE CAN'T BUILD FAST ENOUGH AND CAN'T SEEM TO HOUSE PEOPLE. FAST ENOUGH WITH THE INFLOW AND AT SUCH A HIGH LEVEL SO WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES WE NEED TO BE. AYE INDETERMINACY RESPONSIVE WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH BLESSED TO GET- SOME OF THE TRAILERS FROM THE GOVERNOR ABOUT. NINE OR EIGHT. LITTLE BIT OF THE- PANDEMIC HIT AND THREE WEEKS WITH. A INTO PER LOT INTO A FROM FORTY P. I AM A IT'S BEEN LIVE SAY. AND WE NEED TO DO MORE OF THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT AS WE TRY TO OUT THE PHONE SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I KNOW IT'S CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON. I WILL ASK AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION HOW CAN DIFFERENT POTENTIALLY SILO SYSTEMS LIKE HEALTHCARE CHILD WELFARE CRIMINAL JUSTICE. AND HOUSING BE ALIGNED TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. I JUST WANNA SEE QUICK SOME EXAMPLE ON THE- AB OFFICE OF DIVERSION EVERY IN SAY JOSEPH'S. AND ARM AND HEALTH SO. FROM OUR THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL. IS ALSO IN CONCERT WITH OUR HOUSING FOR HELP MAKE SURE WE'RE GOING INTO JAIL WOULD GET FOLKS THE DOOR BELONG THERE WITH MENTAL. OR ILLNESS WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT THEY HOW SOMETHING IS SOME PRO. THAT ARE QUITE FROM THE- HOW FOR HEALTH IS IN THE- OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH IS GETTING GAUGE. IN SOLUTIONS WILL PRONGED AND SO THAT'S THE IN THE- OF HOW ARE BREAKING DOWN SOME OF THOSE SILOS AND IT'S IT AND HAS A GREAT EFFECT. AND WE NEED TO SCALE THAT CONSIDERS. YEAH I WOULD RATHER A LOT OF. OUR RESEARCH OVER THE LAST. THREE YEARS AS- ON THIS EXACT ISSUE- SPANKING. ACROSS THESE SILOS INSTITUTIONS AND THEN FOCUSING ON STRATEGIC SOLUTIONS JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES- I MENTIONED THAT HAPPENED SINGLE ADULTS BECOME HOME FOR THE TIME. OUR CURRENT CLIENTS AND SO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES- WITH STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND YOU'VE BEEN BOTTLING RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. THERE ARE PATTERNS OF SERVICE UTILIZATION INCLUDING INCARCERATION- AND SUBSTANCE USE. INTENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THEY DO PUT PEOPLE AT HIGHER RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. AND WITH THESE PREDICTIVE MODELS WE CAN SEND RESTLESS CHIU THE DEPARTMENT OR PROACTIVE OUTREACH TO TRY TO STOP THESE CLIENTS ARE BECOMING HOMELESS- AND PILOT IS UNDER WAY NOW- WE WILL KNOW MORE IN THE NEXT SIX TO NINE MONTHS ABOUT WHETHER. THEY WERE PRE SET OUT TO DO IS POSSIBLE BUT THE ENTIRE OF THAT IS TO LEVERAGE OUR MAINSTREAM SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PARTICIPATE IN REDUCING INFLOWS. AND EDUCING THE BURDEN. ON OUR EMERGENCY HOUSING SYSTEM. I'M THE FAMILY SIDE. THE STORY IS ACTUALLY QUITE DIFFERENT. SINGLE ADULT HALF OF THE HAVE A SIR TO WHEN YOU AT FAN. IN UTILIZED AMERICAN SHELTER. IT IS NINETY. NOW PERCENT OF FAMILY. ARE KNOWN TO THE FORTY BE HOME. AND SECONDLY PRINCE PERSON FAMILY. ARE IN ROLLED AND HOW. THAT HAVE. SO IT'S PRESENTED ENORMOUS OFF TO INTERVIEW. BEFORE FAMILIES HOME AND WE'VE BEEN WERE WITH THE SO SERVICE. SO THE QUICKER WE ARE OKAY FOR. THE MODEL THE PULSE OF MY HOWARD AND ROLLED FAMILIES- AND WE HOPE TO START A PILOT WITH THE COW FROM SOMETIME IN THE COMING YEAR AND RECEIVE FUNDING FOR A GUY. SO I THINK THERE ARE ON. TO BRING DOWN SILOS AND STAY. THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE MAJOR IN. AND TO TRY TO THE BURDEN ON OUR HOUSING. IT REQUIRES STATE IN OVER BECAUSE- AND COORDINATION AND I WE ARE ADVANCING THE IN LOSS INTO I WOULD SAY THAT. LANDED SOLUTIONS WE HAVE TO THEM WE HAVE TO MY READ THEY'RE- WE'RE HOPING THEY WERE MAKING SOME PROGRESS. ENGINEER I'M PRETTY SURE YOU BRINGING UP TO I JUST- CALL OUT THAT. THE FAMILIES. IN OUR- THAT COURTNEY ENTRY FOR FAMILY. IS IN. COMBINED OF THE- OF MEASURE A D. S. AND OTHER RE. KEEP HAPPENED SO WE SEEN WHERE. BLENDED. WORK MAKES SENSE ENACT THE COAL OKAY. OF DPS PROVIDERS IN OUR VARIOUS OR- AS WELL AS WE ARE HELLO. IN THE SAN OFFICE I THINK THAT'S IN THE- OF WHAT WORK TO BRING DOWN SO BUT IT DOES NEEDS TO BE SCALED AND DATA THE YOU'RE ON. WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND HOW CAN BE SO. CAN I JUST I WANTED- FOLLOW UP ON OF YOUR WHICH I PRE A LOT OF IT GETS BACK TO THE FUN QUESTION OF WHAT WE CALL. AND ARE WE TRY. WELL YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A GOOD GRIP ON IT AND I WOULD SUGGEST I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER STATES DO- OR OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS BEYOND THE PIC COUNT BUT I MEAN. I TRUE COUNTIES IN ONGOING COUNTER IN THE STREETS ALL DAY LONG WHY ARE WE NOT FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S OUT THERE AND THEN FIGURING OUT WHO'S GOING TO DO WHAT AND THAT'S NOT A SIDE ROAD SYSTEM I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WHEN I GOT HERE. MY TEAMS THE MENTAL HEALTH TEAMS WERE DOING THE SAME WORK AS THE REST OF THE OF THAT THE GENERAL OUTREACH TEAMS AND I SAID NO. WE NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST PROFOUNDLY ILL AND WE COME ACROSS PEOPLE THAT WE CAN REFER TO THE GENERALIST IN THE GENERAL WAS CONFINED PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES. AND THEY CAN REFER THEM TO US SO IT'S A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BUT IT'S ABOUT SAYING WHO'S TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT AND THEN BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE GETTING THE TEAMS TO WORK TOGETHER BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING AFTER. AND I WOULD SUGGEST THE STATE REALLY CONSIDER WHAT IS CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO THE PIT COUNT BECAUSE IT OUGHT TO BE AN ONGOING EFFORT THAT WE'RE WE EVEN THIS DESPITE OUR SIZE. WHERE WE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A REGISTRY AND THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE AND WE DERIVE THE SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAM TYPES AND ALSO THE LEVEL. OF FUNDING. THERE WILL BE REQUIRED. THANK YOU FOR THAT ASSEMBLY. QUIRK SILVA- ARE ARE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PEOPLE WAITING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO OR ARE THEY PUBLIC COMMENT PEOPLE STILL WAITING TO GET ON YES SIR WE'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE THAT PROBLEM SO OKAY YEAR WE'RE GOING TO EITHER DO A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE OR- TAKE A BREAK IF IT'S NOT RESOLVED SOON OKAY. WELL I JUST YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE KIND OF SAID A LOT BUT I DO WANT TO AT LEAST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A GALLON BECAUSE I DO THINK AS WE TALK ABOUT ISSUES OR THINGS THAT WE'D LIKE TO. IN ESSENCE GETS. WE ALSO SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WHEN THINGS ARE DONE WHILE. A NEW- MODEL IN ORANGE COUNTY IT'S CALLED THE ORANGE COUNTY BE WELL. SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD IT ABOUT IT. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A COALITION OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY. ORGANIZATIONS BELIEVE IT OR NOT THAT MANY BECAUSE THERE'S MANY MANY PROVIDERS OUT THERE SMALL LARGE. BUT THIS COALITION ALSO INCLUDES HOSPITALS WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF THE UNIQUE. ELEMENTS AND- THE HOSPITALS IN ORANGE COUNTY A MANY OF THEM PRIVATE- BUT INCLUDING. AND HOLDEN ST JUDE ST JOSEPH HAVE TOGETHER WTH THE COUNTY OTHER HOUSING PARTNERS. AND HAVE JUST OPENED WHAT THEY CALLED ORANGE COUNTY OR BE WELL ORANGE COUNTY. AND WHAT IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO DIVERT. UP MANY TIMES THE PATIENTS THAT WE SEE EITHER BEING ADMITTED TO EMERGENCY ROOMS OR TO OUR JAILS. FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE KNOW THAT- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN PLACE TO TAKE PEOPLE THAT TYPICALLY IT'S EMERGENCY ROOMS. OR JAILS SO THIS NEW CENTER THAT JUST OPENED LAST WEEK IN ORANGE COUNTY WILL BE A NINETY DAY. I AM. HOW FOR MENTAL HEALTH WHERE WHETHER IT'S ADDICTION WHETHER IT'S MENTAL HEALTH WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN THEN BE TAKEN AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES WILL BE PLACE THIS IS A BEEN FUNDED NOW- THROUGH PRIVATE BUT ALSO THROUGH THE COUNTY. WITH MHS DOLLARS- SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT AS I KNOW THEY'RE DOING VIRTUAL TOURS I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT IT THE IDEA AGAIN IS INSTEAD OF HAVING FOURTEEN BEDS ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY. WHERE THERE IS NOW UP TO NINETY DADS AND THIS IS IN ONE LOCATION AND ORANGE COUNTY BUT THE PLAN IS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO BUILD TWO MORE- I THINK IT'S VERY VERY INNOVATIVE BUT ONE OF THE KEY PARTNERS THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN INVOLVED BEFORE OR THE HOSPITALS. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE VESTED INTEREST THERE IS THAT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO HOUSE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES I AND MANY TIMES THEY COME IN AND OUT IN THIS THIS IS MUCH OF MORE OF A HUMANE DIGNIFIED WAY TO LOOK AT OUR- PEOPLE SUFFERING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO WITH THAT. IT'S ONE MODEL I THROW THAT OUT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY. A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT FOR FOLKS THAT ARE TRYING TO GET ON THE LINE WITH PUBLIC COMMENT. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE WE ARE HAVING- REALLY TOUGH TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. OUT WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THIS IS AN AN INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLY ROBUST CONVERSATION.

ABOUT WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE WAY FOR US TO INVEST WHAT HAVE BEEN SCARCE DOLLARS.

THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE JOINT HEARING TODAY AND HOUSING AND HOMELESS AND- BUDGET OF FOUR FOR PARTICIPATING. AND ENGAGING AND ONE OF THE STATE'S BIGGEST CHALLENGES HOUSING HOMELESSNESS AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE APPROACHES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT.

I OPENED UP MY COMMENTS EARLY ON BY STATING THAT THIS IS A AND AN ISSUE THAT IS ABOUT HUMAN LIVES IT'S AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS- BEANS THAT ARE HOMELESS ON VARIOUS DIFFERENT LEVELS. CHRONIC EPISODIC TRANSITIONAL AND HIDDEN HOMELESSNESS- AND THERE'S SO MUCH. THAT IS SO MUCH TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS I'M VERY REAL BUS AND- A CONVERSATION THAT I THINK HAS GIVEN A IDEAS TERMS OF. WHAT CAN THE STATE DO TO MORE HELP MORE ENGAGE. I HAVE A- APPROACHES TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT ISSUES RELATED TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING. MENTAL HEALTH AND HOW.
