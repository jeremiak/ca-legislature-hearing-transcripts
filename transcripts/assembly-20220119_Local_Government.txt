NOW LET'S JUST COVER A FEW THE GROUND RULES AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE FINE TODAY BUT APPROPRIATE CONDUCT HERE. ASSEMBLY HAS EXPERIENCED A NUMBER OF DISRUPTIONS TO COMMITTEES OF FLOOR PROCEEDINGS IN THE PAST. CONDUCT THAT DISRUPTS DISTURBS OR OTHERWISE IMPEDE THE ORDER- OR THE CONDUCT OF THE HEARING IS PROHIBITED. THE AND SUCH CONDUCT RAN CLUED REMOVING AMASSED TALKING WITH- AND LOUDLY UTTERING LOUD THREATENING VOICES. AND ANY OTHER DESTRUCTIVE ACTS. TO ADDRESS THIS I WILL TAKE FIVE WILL TAKE STEPS OF MAKING SURE OUR HEARING PROCESS WILL GO SMOOTHLY. AND WE WILL BE WARNING PEOPLE IF WE HAVE CONTINUED DISRUPTIONS. IF THE CURRENT CONDUCT DOES NOT STOP- REQUEST ASSISTANCE BY THE SWORD SERGEANTS. SO WE ONLY HAVE ONE ITEM TODAY ON THE AGENDA WE WILL TAKE UP TO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE ONE AND UP TO TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I DON'T HAVE ANY SHOWING AT THIS POINT. ARE THESE WITNESSES WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES EACH TO PROVIDE THEIR TESTIMONY ALL SUBSEQUENT WITNESSES SHALL STATE THEIR NAME THEIR ORGANIZATION AND THE POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY. ALSO THIS AFTERNOON I'D LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER VINCE FONG WHO WILL BE STANDING IN FOR SOME REMEMBER RECALL RANDY VOEPEL WHO IS ABSENT TODAY.

RE A QUORUM THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN OUR SINGLE BILL ON TODAY'S AGENDA IS SB FOUR EIGHTEEN BY SENATOR LAYERED SENATOR. PLEASE JOIN US IN PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK. HOW'S THAT THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SO I CHAIRED A LOT OF HEARINGS IN THIS ROOM IT'S DISORIENTING TO PRESENTING SENATE BILL FOR EIGHTEEN THAN BEFORE I BEGIN LET ME DO TWO THINGS FIRST I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE CAN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HER STAFF FOR ALL THE EFFORT THAT WENT TO THAT PREVIOUS SENTENCE HER BECAUSE IT WAS GREAT AND I THINK WE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE- WE NEEDED TO DO HERE I ALSO WANT TO THANK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ROBERT RIVAS AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE AND CENTER ON A COPPER GYRO THEY'RE ALL CO AUTHORS IN THEIR ANYBODY THAT CURRENTLY OR HAS REPRESENTED THE PAPAROA VALLEY DID UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPORTANT. THIS ISSUE IS. IN IT'S BASED ON THE FACT THAT IN NOVEMBER OUR AREA WAS ROCKED BY THE FACT THAT WATSONVILLE HOSPITAL ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CLOSE IT IN TWO WEEKS AND ISSUED LAYOFF NOTICES TO ALL THE EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. TWENTY FIFTY TWO HUNDRED PHYSICIANS AND IT REALLY IS THE BASIC MEDICAL CARE FOR THE PAPAROA VALLEY WHICH CROSSES. ARE COUNTY LINES INTO NORTHERN MONTEREY AND INTO WATSON FILM. I AM NOT IHAVE FOUND IN MY EXPLANATIONS I'VE SAID THIS IS A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. BUT YOU'LL SEE IN THE BILL THAT IT OVERLAPS THE DISTRICT THAT IS SET UP OVERLAPS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS 35% ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND ARE EIGHTY PER CENT OF FREE AND REDUCED UNDUPLICATED MALES IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT IS JUST A STATEMENT ABOUT. OF THE LEVEL OF THIS AREA AND WHAT THIS HOSPITAL SERVES. IN DECEMBER FORMAL BANKRUPTCY WAS ARE DECLARED UNFORTUNATELY A PART TIME JOB AT THE BANKRUPTCY GOES. WITH A TARGET OF BEING FINALIZED RIGHT AT THE END OF MARCH AND NEGOTIATIONS WERE DONE AND THE FIRST RIGHT OF PURCHASE WAS GRANTED. TO A LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUP WHICH IS THE PAPAROA VALLEY HEALTH CARE DISTRICT PROJECT AND IT WAS CREATED BY THE COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ THE CITY OF WATSONVILLE. SLOUGH PRADAL HENTAI WHICH IS THE LONG STANDING NONPROFIT CLINICS SERVING OF FARMWORKERS AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE PROPER OF OUR AND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH. TRUST OF THE PAPAROA FAMILY. AND SO. THIS BILL. THE HOSPITAL DISTRICT THAT WILL ALLOW THAT GROUP TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE HOSPITAL. AND THIS BILL IS URGENTLY NEED THE BIDS ARE DUE ON FEBRUARY THIRTEENTH AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S AN URGENCY MEASURE HERE. AND THAT'S WHY WE TOOK SOME STEPS IN FORMING THE DISTRICT THAT REFLECT ABERDEEN CITY. ESTABLISHED THAT THERE WILL BE AN ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THERE WILL BE DISTRICTS BUT THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO APPOINT THE GOVERNMENT'S OUT THE BATCH SO THAT THEY CAN GET IT OFF THE GROUND IN THE TIME THAT THEY HAVE TO DO AND THEN THE ELECTIONS WILL COME LATER. IT SPECIFIES THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MINUS THE AREA OF APTOSE. AS THE DISTRICT FOR THE HOSPITAL AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT CROSSES BOTH SIDES AND THE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH LAUGH CODES ON EACH SIDE LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION. IN WHICH THEY RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY AND THERE'S AN AGREEMENT THAT IF EITHER LAUGH CO HAS AN ISSUE WITH THE DISTRICT BOUNDARY OVER TIME IT WILL BE REVISITED BUT THIS WILL ALLOW IT TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE URGENCY. OF THAT. WE SEE. AN THE TIME OF THE DAY ALLOWS FOR THAT PURCHASE- TO HAPPEN AND THE BID IS BEING PREPARED AND SO. THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ACCEPTED AT THE BEGINNING ADDRESS A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THAT CAME. FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND FROM THE COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE BECAUSE THIS IS A AN AMENDMENT ON THIS SIDE AND AMENDMENTS CAN'T BE TAKEN IN THE SENATE BECAUSE WE TRYING TO CONCUR AND GET IT TO THE GOVERNOR IN A TIMELY FASHION. AND SO. THE AMENDMENT BASICALLY THAT THIS HOSPITAL. IF IT'S SOLD THE DISTRICT DISSOLVES. ARM AND ONE BUT THE BASIC ISSUE HERE IT OFF IT'S NOT REALLY DELIVERING SERVICES IF IT WILL BE SOLD AS WELL SO IT PROTECTS AGAINST WHAT THE CONCERNS WERE IN OTHER HOSPITAL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE AND IF THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR ANY REPORTS OF ANY KIND ARE WE WILL WE ARE COMMITTED TO DO A FOLLOW UP BILL THAT ARE A DOES DOES BECAUSE WE NEED TO MOVE THIS WITH THE URGENCY. TO ALLOW THI DISTRICT TO BE IN TO OUR PLOY SO WITH ME TODAY AND YOU'LL SEE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THIS BILL WAS ONLY AMENDED LAST FRIDAY AND THERE ARE ALREADY TWENTY MAJOR SIGNIFICANT ENTITIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IT REPRESENTS UNITY ACROSS THE REGION AND ONE OF THE HOSPITALS TO SOLDER IN. ANOTHER PART IN SUPPORT OF HERE. AND I THINK EVERY UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS A KEY PART OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY IN THE AREA THAT IF THIS HOSPITAL WENT UNDER. IT WOULDN'T JUST BE THAT SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE WOULD BE UNEMPLOYED. IT WOULD BE THAT- THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE RECEIVING PRIMARY HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE. AND THERE ARE SOME NUANCES TO OUR WHICH IS THAT KAISER HAS COME INTO OUR AREA IN THE LAST SEVEN RIGHT HERE'S- AND THEY'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO DO THEIR OUT PATIENT CLINICS. BECAUSE THEIR PHYSICIANS HAVE PRIVILEGES AT WATSONVILLE HOSPITAL. SO IT FITS TOGETHER WITH EVERYTHING ELSE SEVERAL. I KNOW THAT THERE WAS. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT HOW FAST THIS WAS MOVING IT HAS TO MOVE THIS FAST FOR THIS TO HAPPEN SO THE ONE WITNESS I HAVE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT IS MIMI HOME TH CHAIR OF THE PAPAROA VALLEY HEALTH CARE DISTRICT PROJECT BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE SHE WAS THE COUNTY HEALTH SERVICES DIRECTOR. UNTIL A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY AND I THINK THE CHAIR KNOWS ARE FROM THE YOLO COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHICH IS ONE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS BEFORE SHE CAME TO OUR REGION SO I APPRECIATE THAT THEN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ALERT I'D LIKE TO ASK THE OPERATOR TO OPEN THE LINE FOR OUR WITNESS AND SUPPORT ME HALL BEGIN. HERE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MEGAN HALL AND I'M THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE POWER OF VALLEY HEALTH CARE DISTRICT PROJECT. WE ARE THE SPONSORS THAT SENATOR THERE SENATE BILL FOR EIGHTEEN WHICH WOULD CREATE A HER OVERLY HEALTHCARE DISTRICT IN SANTA CRUZ AND MONTEREY COUNTY. FOR THE PURPOSES OF TAKING OWNERSHIP OF WATSONVILLE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL TO AVOID AN IMMINENT CLOSURE AND ENSURE THAT OUR HOSPITAL REMAINS OPEN TO THE COMMUNITY. AS THEIR DEMENTIA THE WHAT TALKING HOSPITAL THE ONE. SIX THAT HOSPITAL IT IS CRUCIAL TO THE RESIDENTS OF SANTA CRUZ MONTEREY AND CARMEL VALLEY. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF QUALITY MEDICAL SERVICES INCLUDING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SERVICES. A STEP CHECKS AND DATA QUALITY PEDIATRICS MEDICAL SURGICAL CARE ORTHOPEDICS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CARE YOUR METHODOLOGY AND MORE. IT IS ONE OF ONLY TWO HOSPITALS IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WITH AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND IN TWENTY TWENTY WHAT THE BILL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL TO DELIVER THE VAST MAJORITY OF BABIES IN THE COUNTY OVER ANY OTHER FACILITY. SERVING A SIGNIFICANT IMMIGRANT POPULATION THE HOSPITAL PROVIDE CARE TO THOSE WHO WITHOUT ENGLISH ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY IN THEIR PREFERRED LANGUAGE. AND NEARLY HALF OF THE HOSPITAL PATIENTS ARE A MEDIC CAL. HER VALLEY THE LARGEST COMMUNITY OF THE CITY OF WATSONVILLE WHICH IS A STARK WE FACED MANY HEALTH AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AFTER THE PANDEMIC LIKE MANY COMMUNITY WE EXPERIENCED LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT SCHOOL CLOSURES. AND NON ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WHO WERE REQUIRED TO STAY AT HOME. OVERCROWDED IN THAT STANDARD CAN TRANSPORTATION AND THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING INTENSIFIED DISPARITIES OVERNIGHT. THE CURRENT VALLEY HAS SEEN DRAMATIC IN DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF COVERT NINETEEN INSPECTION WHICH I THOUGHT DURING MY TIME AT% HEALTH SERVICES AGENCY DIRECTOR AND INCIDENT COMMANDER OF THE COOK AT NINETEEN RESPONSE. IT ALSO HAD HIGHER HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH- TO THE REST OF SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. AS A FORMER COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE IMPORTANCE OF WATSONVILLE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. IN PROVIDING TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES FACED CUTTING THE HEALTH OF ALL IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL IN SERVING OUR PRIMARILY LOW INCOME UNDER AND UNINSURED POPULATIONS OF COLOR COLOR FOR OVER A CENTURY AND HAS BEEN CRUCIAL IN SERVING THOSE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY KOPET. HOSPITAL DOES HAVE A HISTORY OF FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. UNDER COSTLY PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND WHILE THE COMMUNITY IS DISCUSS PUBLIC OWNERSHIP FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE INCIDENT LATE LAST YEAR ON THANKSGIVING WEEK WHEN THE CURRENT OWNER OPERATOR SENT TO WARN NOTICES ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEES ANNOUNCING ITS INTENTION TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY AND RELEASETHEM ON JANUARY IN JANUARY. AT WAS. THE IMPETUS FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. THE CURRENT OWNER OPERATORS FILED FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. IN OUR ORGANIZATION IMMEDIATELY BEGAN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CURRENT OWNER OPERATOR SO THAT WE COULD PURCHASE THE HOSPITAL THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. BECAUSE SHE SIMPLY RESULTED IN AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE OWNER OPERATOR AND WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OURSELVES THE PROJECT AS THE PRIORITY BETTER. AND AN ISSUE THE PROCESS FOR THE YET TO BE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICT TO TAKE OVER THE HOSPITAL OPERATION. ADDITIONALLY THE CURRENT OWNER OPERATOR AND ITS LARGEST CREDITORS HAVE AGREED TO DEFER CLOSURE OF THE HOSPITAL AFTER MARCH ALLOWING US TIME TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THE FORMATION OF A NEW HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED AS KEY MILESTONES IN OUR PROJECT ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT FILED AS PART OF THE FEDERAL. CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY COURT PROCESS. THE PROJECT STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT PUBLIC OWNERSHIP THEIR HEALTHCARE DISTRICT OFFERS THE MOST PROMISING FUTURE FOR WHAT THE BILL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. AND FOR NOT JUST CONTINUING BUT IMPROVING HEALTHCARE ACCESS THROUGHOUT THE HOME VALLEY. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A HIGHLY UNUSUAL REQUEST AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WITH COMMITTEE CHAIR AND STAFF ABOUT ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I ASSURE YOU THAT WE TAKE SERIOUSLY OUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING ACCESS TO CARE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND BELIEVE THAT THE PATH THAT WE'RE ON IT THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED.
