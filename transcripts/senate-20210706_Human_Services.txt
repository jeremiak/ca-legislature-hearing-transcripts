GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS TATUM ADLER WITH THE INTERNET BY VOTERS ON BEHALF OF THE LEARNING CARE GROUP THE SECOND LARGEST FOR PROFIT CHILD% CARE PROVIDER IN NORTH AMERICA IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU. LINE. TO FOURTEEN. NUMANTIA SENATORS PACIFIC ISLANDERS FROM THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ONCE COUNTY MURDER GROUP OF A HUNDRED LOCATIONS ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND FAMILIES THAT WE SERVICE WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU MODERATOR. YOU WERE REBUILDING AND REFORMING CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM HAS BEEN A MAJOR LEGISLATIVE ISSUES THIS YEAR. I AM PLEASED THAT THE ISSUES GIVEN THE ATTENTION THAT IT DESERVES BECAUSE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND FOR THE FAMILIES THAT NEED CHILD CARE. WE'VE LOST SO MANY PROVIDERS WHICH IS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS TO RETURN TO WORK. AND WORKING FAMILIES NEED CHILD CARE THAT IS AGE AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE AFFORDABLE MEETS OR CULTURAL LINGUISTIC NEEDS AND IS AVAILABLE DURING THE PARENTS WORKING HOURS AND OF COURSE OUR PROVIDERS DESERVE TO BE COMPENSATED AT A FAIR RATE. THE MAJOR THE MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL BRINGING FOUR YEAR OLDS INTO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED IN THE BUDGET. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S RECENT EFFORTS TO BUILT IN PROTECTIONS FOR FAMILIES AND FOR PROVIDERS WHILE I REMAIN CONCERNED WITH BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE MAJOR CHANGE IN OUR CHILD CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. I AM ENCOURAGED THAT THIS IS JUST ONE PIECE OF LARGER EFFORTS TO REFORM THE CHILD CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM INCLUDING CHANGES IN PROVIDER RATE AND FAMILY FEES. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY- THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE ALL WHILE THE CHILD CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS RECOVERING FROM THE IMPACTS OF COVE IN NINETEEN. I WANT TO STRESS THAT WE NEED TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION AND MONITOR THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES WHAT THAT'S AT ALL- BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I KNOW I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY ALSO HEAR THE SPELL AND EDUCATION COMMITTEE- BUT SINCE THIS IS A NEW COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW I. NOW WE'RE HEARING FROM PEOPLE THE CHILD CARE COMMUNITY WHO ARE WORRIED THAT- BASICALLY AT LEAST BASED ON ANALYSIS THAT THIS WOULD. BASICALLY REMOVE- THE CHILDREN WHO ARE FOR AN OLDER FROM CHILD CARE BUT YET I ALSO NOTED THAT THE BILL VERY EXPLICITLY SAYS- THAT- THAT WE WILL BE YOU KNOW PROTECTING THAT CHOICE AND- AND- THIS IS AN OPTION IT'S OPTIONAL IT'S NOT REQUIRED SO- PERHAPS IN A NEW THAT AND SOME RECORDING YOUR CHAIR OF THE OF BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FOR THE ASSEMBLY. CAN YOU HELP US PUT US INTO THIS THE LARGER CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR ECA OVERALL- AND HOW THIS FITS INTO THIS LARGER. IT IS THIS LARGER CONTEXT. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN I THINK OUR CHAIR KIND OF SAID IT WELL THAT THIS IS A PIECE OF THE LARGER PUZZLE. AND IF THIS WAS THE ONLY PIECE IT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC IT'S ALWAYS BEENA QUEST TO ME AND OTHER SUPPORTERS HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS. BUT IF WE WERE DOING THIS WITHOUT INCREASING RATES AND FOCUSING ON ON SLOTS. AND EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROVIDERS TO SERVE ZERO THREE THREE WITH THE INCREASE RATE STRUCTURE AND MORE SLOTS. THAT WOULD NOT WORK TOGETHER BUT- IT THE BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IF THE IF THERE'S A FAMILY THAT THAT LIKE THE WITNESS SAID EARLIER THE OPPOSITION THEY LIKE THIS. I THINK THE SAID- A BI LINGUAL- PROGRAM THAT FITS THEIR NEEDS AND IF THEIR INCOME ELIGIBLE FAMILY. YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL THAT FAMILIES FOR SO THEY'RE GONNA BE GOING ON TO CANDOR AND FIRST BY TIMES BILLS IMPLEMENTED. BUT IF THERE IS A TWO YEAR OLD THE WORLD TODAY THAT WANTS TO GO TO THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM. AND THEY'RE ELIGIBLE THEY CAN CONTINUE CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE PUT IT IN. OUR BILL THAT INCOME ELIGIBLE FAMILIES CAN CONTINUE TO DO SO- WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS IS FAMILIES THAT TODAY HAVE NO OPTIONS. THERE TO- BRIDGE TO GET FREE BECAUSE THEY MAKE YOU KNOW SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT IN OUR AREAS ACROSS THE STATE. THOSE FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING PAYING THE RENT IN THEIR BILLS AND- THEY DON'T GET THE SUBSIDIZED PROGRAM THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE FREE SO THEY WOULD NOW GET AN OPTION. TO GO TO T. K. WE ALSO HAVE- ANOTHER COMPANION BILL THAT WAS HEARD. IN THIS COMMITTEE A FEW. MONTHS AGO BY SEN EARLY MON SB FIFTY WHICH WOULD SHIFT ALL THE MONEY THAT CURRENTLY GOES. TO SERVE FOUR YEAR OLDS AND STATE PRESCHOOL AND GIVE THOSE TO PROVIDERS TO SERVE MORRISON THREE ZERO THREE THREE. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME. AND MOST VULNERABLE THREE TWO AND THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD GET TWO YEARS. OF TOP QUALITY FREE PRE K. IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A ON WHICH WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE MAKER WHICH WOULD. ADDRESS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND THEN LASTLY I THINK THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING TO FINALIZE THE STATE BUDGET. I THINK THERE ARE LIKE LITERALLY THREE ISSUES THAT WERE STILL. NEGOTIATING THE SPEAKER AND THE PRO TEM ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR. AND I THINK THE TOP ONE IS THIS ISSUE OPERATE REFORM. SO WE DID PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET. TWO WEEKS AGO ON MONDAY BOTH HOUSES. OUR LAST MONDAY I GUESS IT WAS. ON TO FIND GREAT REFORM. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A COMPANION BILL EITHER A TRAILER BILL OR CENTER LAID HIS BILL. TO SET THOSE PIECES INACTION IN MOTION TO MAKE TO MAKE TWO TO AUTHORIZE IT. SO IN IN TILL WE GET THAT DONE I THINK THE CHILD CARE. RULES I K. DON'T TELL ME SHE CHAU THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL THESE OTHER. RIGHT SO- AND I WOULD SAY IS WE'RE WE'RE GONNA WRAP THE BUDGET UP SOON AND THIS IS A PRIORITY OF OUR- LEADERS IN EACH HOUSE SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN OUR BUDGET PROCESS UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS DONE. SO YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE IS GOING THROUGH THE- PUBLIC THIS COMMUNITY DAY THAN APPROACH ON THE FLOOR SO. I THINK IN A FEW WEEKS WILL HAVE MORE CLARITY. AND THAT THIS WHOLE- PACKAGE I THINK WILL ADDRESS. THESE ISSUES AND THEN LASTLY I SAID THIS EARLIER NOW I'M RAMBLING ON MADAM CHAIR. BUT WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH THE OPPOSITION FOR WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS IF NOT. A COUPLE YEARS ON THIS TOPIC. AND WE REALLY HAVE HEARD SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS AND PUT THEM IN. THIS BILL AND THE TRAILER BILL AND SO I'M- I'M COMMITTED AND WE ALREADY HAVE- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH WITH THE- CHILD CARE FIELD TO MAKE SURE AS THIS IS IMPLEMENTED. WE LEAVE NOBODY BEHIND. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT. OBVIOUSLY IS BEING HEARD AND POLICY COMMITTEE BUT IT WOULD ACTUALLY GET TO THE FLOOR UNTIL ESSENTIALLY. AUGUST RIGHT BECAUSE IT HAVE TO GO TO APPROPRIATIONS AND SO FORTH SO THOSE BUDGET PANEL BUDGET DISCUSSIONS. HOPEFULLY WILL BE RESOLVED BEFORE WE SEE THIS ON THE- BACK ON THE FLOOR AND- ASSURE YOU MAKE WHATEVER ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY. AT THAT POINT SO THANK YOU SO MUCH SUMMARY. SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO ECHO- MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT CAME FROM THE DYESS AND WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CONTINUING TO BE A CHAMPION- FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BILL AND I DID SAY THAT I WAS- GOING TO SUPPORT IT BUT I ALSO SHARED WITH YOU- A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT I HAVE COMING FROM THE CHILD CARE FIELD. YOU KNOW DAHLE AND- IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS IN THE EASY COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW LIKES TO KATE IN LIKE EIGHT YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS IN THIS BODY. I'M IN THEY DON'T LIKE IT TODAY- AND- I THINK WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB COLLECTIVELY OF ACKNOWLEDGING. THE REAL EXPERTISE THAT EASY PROFESSIONALS OF CARE FOR ZERO TO THREE. ACTUALLY HAVE WHEN EDUCATING OUR YOUNG CHILDREN. AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS. THAT I HAVE HEARD IS. YOU KNOW MOVING- LARGE SWATHS OF YOUNG PEOPLE INTO- TKA INTO SCHOOL SETTINGS INTO FACILITIES THAT ARE REALLY NOT OUTFITTED ARE DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE THESE LITTLE FOUR YEAR OLDS. I'M IS ALSO A REAL ISSUE. YOU KNOW YOUNG BABIES WHO ARE FOR THEY DON'T PEE ON COMMAND THEY NEED TO HAVE BATHROOMS IN THE CLASSROOMS THERE ARE A LOT OF SORT OF YOU KNOW- THE SETTINGS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE. YOU KNOW THESE LITTLE PEOPLE WHO ARE. TRANSITIONING THEMSELVES- AND ARE USED TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF SETTINGS. AND YOU KNOW FOR MANY AND THIS ISN'T IN YOUR BILL BUT FOR MANY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHO- WERE ON THE FRONT LINES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND TAKING CARE OF OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO WORK IN. THESE FAMILY CHILD CARE SETTINGS. YOU KNOW FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD ON SO MANY OTHER THINGS AND NOT RATE REFORM IS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THEM. YOU KNOW IT AND THEY CONTINUE TO BE PUT. ON TO THE BACK OF THE BUS AND THE OTHER REALITY IS WHICH YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT SIPHONS OFF THE FOUR YEAR OLD YOU KNOW AND LEAVES THE HIGHEST COST. BABIES ZERO TO THREE- IN THE NEWS- FCC EIGHT SETTINGS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE INCREDIBLE I MEAN THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE- AND THAT CAN BE A REASON WHY. YOU KNOW DOORS ARE FACED ARE ARE FORCED TO CLOSE. I DON'T DEAL WITH DEPRIVE ITS- THAT'S NOT CRYSTAL STAIRS WASN'T A PRIVATE WE WERE DEALING WITH SUB CITY FAMILIES ALL THE TIME- ARM. AND FOR RENTAL CHOICE DOESN'T REALLY BECOME PARENTAL CHOICE WHEN THE OPTION THAT IS FREE WHEN ALL OF THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ARE NOT DO NOT COST THE SAME. WHEN YOU HAVE ONE SYSTEMAX FREE IT DOES KIND OF MANIPULATE WHAT TRUE PARENTAL CHOICE IS. YOU KNOW HAVING SAID ALL THAT- YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE STEPPING UP TO TAKE CARE OF OUR LITTLE PEOPLE- AND THIS IS A PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE. BUT THOSE FAMILIES ALSO. CAN'T REALLY DEAL WITH PART DAY CARE YOU KNOW THE PART DAY CARES FOR FOLKS WHO ARE WEALTHY- WHO HAVE SOMEONE WHO AT IN YOU KNOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY CAN DROP EVERYTHING I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WE CAN PICK UP THE BABY. AND TAKE THEM HOME AND CARE FOR THEM AND THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN SOUTH LA. AND SO I HOPE THAT THESE THINGS CAN MOVE TOGETHER SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE A PUZZLE WITH ALL OF THE PIECES THAT ARE CONNECTED. THAT PROVIDE A HOLISTIC- MENU OF CHOICES FOR PARENTS OF ALL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS WHO ARE ABLE TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION POSSIBLE FOR THEIR LITTLE PEOPLE- AND YOU KNOW I TOLD YOU THIS I DON'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO STEP UP- AND THEY- WE SAW THAT THEY- WERE NOT DOING WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DURING THE PANDEMIC AS IT RELATES TO EDUCATING- OUR YOUNG FOLKS. YOU KNOW WHO WERE SCHOOL AGE KIDS AND SO I WOULD REALLY BE CHALLENGED TO OPEN UP A SCENARIO WHERE WERE FUNNELING OUR LITTLE BABIES INTO THE SAME. INTO THE SAME SYSTEM SO I'M HOPING THAT THIS IS PART OF SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER AND MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAT INCLUDES RIGHT REFORM BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T. THEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE NOT HELPED THE PEOPLE WHO WE CONTINUE TO LEAN ON. I MEAN. THANK YOU WE HAVE AN- SENATOR PAN IF YOU WANNA WRITTEN OUT ON THAT THANK YOU FOR CAST SORRY FOR COMING BACK ON AGAIN- BUT- WHEN THE OTHER ISSUES I THINK AND APPRECIATES SIR KAMAGRA BRING IT UP AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I DEALT WITH BEFORE WHEN I WAS IN- I THINK BUDGETS OF THREE. IS THAT IT IS WERE YOU KNOW STANDING YOUNGER CHILDREN GO INTO POTENTIALLY GOING INTO TJ MENDOZA DEBATE ABOUT THE STANDARDS OF FACILITIES AND SO FORTH AND FEATURED A DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SELF- SO AGAIN I THINK AS WE'RE LOOKING AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDING TKA TO HELP KIDS WHO ARE FOR- WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT BOTH FACILITIES AND ALSO THE STAFFING IS APPROPRIATE SO- RECOGNIZING AS SITTING SOME THE C. PROVIDERS FIND OUT I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE SOME MEMBERS A CHAMPION FOR YOU SEE IS THAT. IT'S NOT JUST IT IT'S NOT JUST PUTTING KIDS INTO A CLASSROOM RIGHT IT'S ABOUT FOCUSING ON OR DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES SOCIALIZATION AND ALSO BE SURE YOU HAVE A DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SETTINGS AS WELL- FOR THEM WHICH IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT THAN THE OLDER KIDS SO YOU JUST CAN'T A CLASSROOM AND TURN INTO A T. T. K. CLASSROOMS RIGHT YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO REVAMP THAT SOME SELF- THE SAUSAGES ONE. THANK ATIKAMEKW FOR PER THAT OUT AND THEN JUST ONE EXPRESS- THE DEBT I'VE- MY- OF THAT WELL BUT I THINK IT'S A THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT AND- BUT I HAVE MADE. YUP THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE AND THE NEED TO FOR THE TWO PERHAPS THREE SALMON THAT AS WE MOVE TO K. TO AGAIN. THIS YOUNGER GROUP THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS NO FINANCING. AS MCCARTY WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU AYE AYE I WOULD ANSWER THAT ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE BUT MAYBE IT CAN JUST. ADDRESS AND REASSURE A FEW OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY CENTER PAN INCOME LONGER IN IN MY CLOTHES- YOU KNOW THIS. TAKES A LOT OF PIECES. UP TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS AND THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE A YEAR OF PLANNING. AND A COUPLE YEAR PHASE IN PROCESS WHICH I WE ASSUME. LOCAL COMMITTEES ARE GONNA DO ANYWAY BUT WE'RE PUTTING IN THIS BILL REQUIRING. COUNTY OPS EDUCATION TO COORDINATE THAT AT EACH LEVEL WITH A LOCAL. PLANNING COUNCILS. AND- WEEK WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE PAST I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST WENT TO GO VISIT TKA CLASSROOM TEN YEARS AGO RIGHT DOWN THE STREET HERE. IT HAD ONE. TEACHER AND THAT TIME WAS BEFORE THE CLASS SIZE REDUCTION LC FAT. IS LIKE THIRTY TWO CATS AND I WAS AND DOES A NINE I'M SURPRISED THE TEACHER DIDN'T YOU KNOW FALL APART- SO THAT'S IS A DISASTER FOR ANY BUT I CAN IMAGINE HAVING. ONE TEACHER WITH THAT MANY. FOUR YEAR OLDS BUT IN THIS IN THIS BILL AND COMPANION BUDGET PIECE WE'RE SAYING. WE WANT RATIOS LIKE CHILD CARE WHERE THERE'S- ONE ADULT TO TWELVE KIDS SO EACH. TAKE A CLASSROOM WOULD HAVE NO MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR STUDENTS. AND TWO TEACHERS TO. TO PROFESSIONALS ONE. CREDENTIAL TEACHER AND ONE PART PROFESSIONAL LIKE WE HEARD FROM. THE CSEA MEMBER FROM SINGER- AS FAR AS FACILITIES YOU'RE RIGHT SOME IS CLASSROOMS ARE NOT READY. THEY DON'T HAVE LITTLE THINGS LITTLE BATHROOMS- WHICH IS WHY WE PUT. SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. ONE TIME TO HELP- RETROFIT. A PLUS SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE DISABILITIES MONEY IN BONDS AND SO FORTH. AND SO ON THEY KNOW THEIR CHALLENGE AHEAD AND WE'RE- WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM. AND THEN I DO KNOW THAT THE THREE LINGERING YOU SEE HEAR FROM PARENTS AND PROVIDERS OF THESE ISSUES YOU MENTIONED. SENATOR CONLOGUE OR IS. IS HOW THIS IMPACTS THAT CHOICE AND WITH THE RATES IN THE AND THAT CRAP SO. OUR PACKAGE AND LIMóN BILL ON THE BUDGET WE DO HAVE MONEY FOR. FULL DAY WRAPS. IF PARENTS NEED TO HAVE PROOF THAT THE AFTER CARE AFTER SCHOOL. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THAT CERTAINLY OF THE AVAILABLE AND THEN FOR THE ISSUES THAT I THINK ARE THE MOST LEGIT WITH THE CENTERS AS FAR AS- HEY HOW CAN WE SERVE MORE. THREE YEAR OLDS IN INFANTS AND TODDLERS IF THOSE ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE WELL. THAT'S WHERE THIS WHOLE RATING. IS THE KEY TO THE PUZZLE TERM TO MAKE IT ALL WORK.

CALIFORNIA'S AGING POPULATION IS ALSO INCREASINGLY SUFFERING HOMELESSNESS ACCORDING TO UCSF RESEARCHERS APPROXIMATELY 50% OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY AND HALF OF THOSE BECAME HOMELESS AFTER THE REACHED THE AGE OF FIFTY. ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO FULL INCLUSION AND EQUITY FOR ALL AGES IS ELDER ABUSE WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO IMPACT 10% OF OLDER ADULTS LIVING AT HOME. AND WITH LOSSES TOTALING IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO ADDRESS THIS TWO PRONGED ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AND ELDER ABUSE EFFECTIVELY THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. INTO PLANNING AND SUPPORT SERVICES. TO FILL SUCH A NEED AB SIX NINETY FIVE WOULD EXPAND AND ENHANCE THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS. OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA BY FIRST LOWERING THE AGE OF ELIGIBILITY FROM SIXTY FIVE TO SIXTY TO SERVE HIGHLY VULNERABLE ADULTS. SECOND IN EXPANDING ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES TO PROVIDE LONG TERM CASE MANAGEMENT. AND THIRD BY BUILDING UPON THE SUCCESSFUL HOME SAFE PROGRAM TO ASSIST ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICE CLIENTS WHO NEED HELP WITH HOUSING ISSUES. BY EXPANDING THE OPERATIONAL CAPACITY MORE OF OUR ELDERLY POPULATIONS CAN FIND SAFE AND STABLE HOUSING. IT WILL ALSO ALLOW THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES TO SERVE AND EXPANDED OLDER ADULT POPULATION ANYMORE UPSTREAM CAPACITY AND INTERVENE EARLIER IN SITUATIONS BEFORE THEY REACH A CRISIS POINT.

AB TWO TWO SIX WOULD CLARIFY LICENSING ISSUES AND ENSURE MUCH NEEDED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR CHILDREN'S CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS. CURRENTLY AN ESTIMATED THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DO NOT RECEIVE THEM. SUICIDE IS NOW THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG ADOLESCENTS. IN ADDITION FORTY SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE NO CHILD PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL INPATIENT BEDS FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWELVE. THE NEED FOR CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH RESIDENTIAL SERVICES COULD NOT BE MORE URGENT THAN IT IS NOW. AB TWO TWO SIX WOULD CLARIFY THE PROGRAMS THAT PLAN TO PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CHILDREN'S CRISIS RESIDENTIAL SERVICES TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE SHALL BE DESIGNATED AS PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM. P. T. R. F. WITH THE APPROPRIATE LICENSING CATEGORY IS ESTABLISHED THE STATE AND COUNTIES WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE CONTINUUM OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE ALL EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME CHANGES THAT WE MADE THROUGH SOME AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE. THOSE AMENDMENTS MAKE TWO IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE BILL FIRST THEY REINFORCE THE REQUIREMENT FOR PHYSICIAN OVERSIGHT. THROUGH AN RIEN CLUED IN THE TEN DAY IN LENGTH OF STAY LIMITATION. AND SECOND THEY INCLUDE REFERENCE TO THE EXISTING RIGHTS OF FOSTER YOUTH IN THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE TO STRENGTHEN FOSTER YOUTH PROTECTIONS UNDER THIS BILL. I AM HOPEFUL THESE AMENDMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. IN THE SPIRIT OF WORKING TOGETHER FOR OUR YOUTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BRING THEM THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED.

THE USE IN OUR STATE ARE AND YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE HALF OF ALL THE APPOINTEES MUST HAVE EXPERIENCED A DISABILITY HOMELESSNESS FOSTER CARE.

SURE DOWN THE MEMBERS I PRESENT TO YOU AB FORTY SEVEN WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW PROGRAM TO CREATE A COORDINATED AND UNIFIED RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN PARENTS AFFECTED BY BORDER SEPARATION. DURING THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION'S ZERO TOLERANCE IMMIGRATION POLICY. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST TWENTY SIX HUNDRED CHILDREN WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER.

CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE STATES FOR PARENTS WHO NEED CHILD CARE SERVICES. WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATE AND FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS THAT HELP FAMILIES PAY FOR CHILD CARE FAMILIES WHO NEED THIS THIS CARE MUST TILL PAY WHAT IS CALLED FAMILY FEES. THESE FEES GROW AS INCOME RISES AND CAN BE UP TO SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH. WHICH IS NOT AFFORDABLE FOR MANY WORKING FAMILIES. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ONLY HEIGHTENED THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE. ESPECIALLY FOR WORKING MOTHERS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WHO ARE SIGNIFICANT OR SIGNIFICANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL WORKFORCE. AB NINETY TWO WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY CONVENING A WORK GROUP OF PARENTS PROVIDERS AND CHILD CARE STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP AN EQUITABLE SLIDING SCALE FOR FAMILY FEES THAT BETTER REFLECTS FAMILIES BUDGETS. THE BILL WILL PROTECT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BY ENSURING THEY DO NOT ABSORB THE COST OF A REDUCTION IN FAMILY FEES AND THAT THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE SPACES IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT TO REDUCED.

WE APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE ON THAT BUT LET ME PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE EIGHTY THREE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH AN OLDER ADULT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR TO OVERSEE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS ESTABLISH OUTCOME INDICATORS INTEGRATE CARE AND STANDARDIZE GERIATRICS TRAINING FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. WE KNOW THAT ONE IN FIVE OLDER ADULTS EXPERIENCE MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS HOWEVER LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF ALL OLDER ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT. UNDIAGNOSED AND UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE A SERIOUS IMPACT FOR OLDER ADULTS AND THEIR LOVED ONES FROM. NINETEEN NINETY ONE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA SITE 58% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SUICIDES FOR THOSE AGE SIXTY FIVE TO EIGHTY FOUR. AND A 50% INCREASE FOR THOSE EIGHTY FIVE AND OLDER YES COMPARED TO FOURTEEN POINT 8% AVERAGE STATEWIDE ACROSS ALL AGE GROUPS SUICIDE RATES ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH IN RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS SEVERELY LACKING. IN CALIFORNIA THE OLDER ADULT POPULATION WILL INCREASE 64% BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TO TWELVE MILLION ADULTS AGE SIXTY AND ABOVE BY THAT SAME TIME THE US CENSUS WHILE NUMBER USED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH FOUND A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES AND DEFICIENCIES IN THE CURRENT BEHAVIOR HEALTH STRUCTURE FOR OLDER ADULTS. THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS BY ESTABLISHING STATEWIDE LEADER. GIVEN THE RAPIDLY GROWING SEGMENT OF THE STATE'S POPULATION THAT IS MADE UP OF OLDER ADULTS IN THE SIGNIFICANT AND UNIQUE CHALLENGES. THAT OLDER ADULTS FACE IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE STATE APPOINTED LEADER IN A DOCTOR PLANTING CREASE IMPROVE. AND INTEGRATE MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS. ON THE PHONE LINE TO TESTIFY IS DOCTOR JANET FRANK A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING AND ONE OF THE LEAD AUTHORS OF THE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY. AND I ALSO HAVE SURELY CROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU. WHAT MRS MAY PROCEED. HELLO MY NAME IS- JANET FRANK AND I'M PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING I AM A COMMISSIONER AND ALSO ON FACULTY AT THE UCLA FIELDING SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN OUR STUDY SPONSORED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. WE FOUND THAT FEW PROGRAMS OR OUTREACH EFFORTS FOR TAYLOR TO THE COMPLEX CARE NEEDS FOR OLDER ADULTS. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT UNMET SERVICE NEEDS AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES ACROSS THE STATE. FOR EXAMPLE OF THE ESTIMATED SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND OLDER CALIFORNIANS IN NEED OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ONLY YEAR EIGHTEEN. WHILE OLDER ADULTS ARE 16% OF THE ADULT MEDICAID POPULATION LESS THAN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL ALSO SUPPORT OUR STUDIES FINDING. IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS BILL WE NOTED THAT THERE IS A LACK OF LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE FOR OLDER ADULT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. ASKING AB THREE EIGHTY THREE NOW IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS IMPORTANT POLICY TRIP- DIRECTION INCLUDING THE HELP REIMAGINE GOAL OF THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLAN ON AGING. IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OFFICE OF MEDICARE INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION A COMPUTER A COMPONENT OF THE MASTER PLAN AIMS TO LEAD INNOVATIVE MODELS FOR DUAL ELIGIBLES AND MEDICARE ONLY INDIVIDUAL. THE PROPOSED CONCESSION IN AB TREATED THREE WOULD BE A KEY RESOURCE FOR THAT AFTER. IN ADDITION CAL. CULTURE ADMINISTRATOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION STATEWIDE AND THE PHYSICIAN WILL BE IMPORTANT SURE SURE THAT THE GAPS IN OLDER ADULTS ARE EXTRA. WITHOUT STATE OVERSIGHT AND LEADERSHIP OLDER ADULTS ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE FROM LOW INCOME GROUPS AND FOR MINORITY GROUPS WILL CONTINUE BEING UNDERSERVED AB TREATING DREAM PROVIDES RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE STATEWIDE EQUITY ISSUE. AS EMPHASIZED DURING PANDEMIC THE SITUATION IS DIRE AND REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION RIGHT NOW THERE IS NOT ONE PERSON. YOU HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THE SYSTEM BECOME MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- NEXT WITNESS.

TREMENDOUSLY SUPPORTIVE TO THEM THEY DON'T. NEED THAT KIND OF A DOLLARS THAT SORT THE REQUIRED TO STAND UP. YOU KNOW A NEW FACILITY LIKE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO GET STARTED- BUT THEY DO STRUGGLING THEY DO PROVIDE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF. THOSE FOR THE RESOURCES AND SERVICES THAT. ARE PRESCRIBED IN THE BILL SO- I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF GETTING THESE RESOURCES. OUT THERE I. AM DON'T VOTE NO FARMWORKERS SYSTEMS- AND I SERVING DO THAT- BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT FOLKS. IN MY DISTRICT THE- WHO HAD DUG DEEP IN THEIR POCKETS TO TRY TO SUPPORT AN ACTIVITY LIKE THIS- THAT SEARCH FOR COUNTIES- TO. YOU KNOW COME TO ME LATER AND SAY. OH WHY WOULD YOU SUPPORT A MEASURE THAT LEAVES US OUT SO YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THAT'S A CLEAR EXPLANATION FOR AMOUNT ON IT AND AGAIN I DO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR- YOU KNOW FOR YOUR INTENTIONS AND THEN TRYING TO EXPAND THIS KIND OF WORK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM- WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YES IT WOULD NINE REALLY APPRECIATE- OF THE- COMMENTS ARE MADE BY- CENTER CORTESE- THEN IN TERMS OF THIS- IF I COULD OFFER. THE ONLY REASON THERE IS AN EXPLICIT LANGUAGE IN HERE IDENTIFYING CURRENT ONES IS HAS I BROUGHT THIS TO THE STATE I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I WAS TRYING TO FUND. THE PROGRAM IN MY OWN COUNTY AND SORT OF BE SELF SERVING FROM THAT STANDPOINT- BUT CERTAINLY IF IT IS A SENATE'S PLEASURE- I. HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO ASSISTING. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THESE ARE GOOD PROGRAMS REALLY GOOD AND IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT I HAVE. I HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO HAVING A CURRENT PROGRAMS ALSO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE GRANT FUNDING ALONG WITH THE OTHER COUNTY CENTER AFTER. AND AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE. DOING THE SAME SERVICES AND MEETING THE GRANTS WHATEVER THE GRANT STANDARDS ARE SET UP BY THE COMMITTEE I WOULD HAVE NO OPPOSITION THAT AND- QUITE FRANKLY YOU'VE MADE ME MORE AWARE OF. SUCH YOU'VE MADE THE INQUIRY OF THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW OTHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THEY- HE SINGS GENERALLY FLY PRETTY LOW ON THE RADAR SCREEN AND BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FUNDING YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT AND- I'M MORE AWARE OF THAT AT THIS POINT TIME SO. THE OTHER THING IF I COULD. ADD- AND THAT IS. WE FEEL FOR. THAT CREATE THIS PROGRAM WE THOUGHT IT HAD ORIGINALLY THE CONVERSATIONS WERE AROUND LABOR. AND THE YOU KNOW TENSION AND TRYING. A GREAT WAY TO TAKE CARE OF FARMWORKERS AND THEIR PROBLEMS ARE ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AND EASILY EXPLOITED. POPULATIONS OUT THERE AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THEIR TRUST IN VENTURA COUNTY GOVERNMENTS GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY. AND WHEN COVERT HERE THAT. WE SIMPLY HAD A FAR BETTER NETWORK TO GET OUT THAT INFORMATION ABOUT VACCINES AND MASK AND ALL OF THAT. NOT JUST A BETTER NETWORK BUT A TRUSTED NETWORK PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY BEEN HELPING PEOPLE WITH. HOW DO I GET HELP WITH MY CHILD IS HAVING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND- ALL OF THOSE KINDS SIX WE ARE TRUSTED. MEMBERS OUT THERE AND- I'M I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE A FEW OTHER PLACES IN CENTRAL COAST WHERE THAT'S HAPPENING- AND I WANT TO SUPPORT ALL OF THEM WHICH IS WHY I'M- TALKING A LITTLE LONGER THAN I SHOULD AT THIS POINT TIME BUT I. I REALLY WANT TO BE AN AMBASSADOR. FOR HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IF CALIFORNIANS GOING SUPPORT. AND AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER IN EVERY COUNTY. I THINK WE'VE KIND OF MOVED AS A POINT WHERE WE OUGHT TO SAY WE OUGHT TO SUPPORT A FARMWORKER RESOURCE PROGRAM. IN THESE COUNTIES ALSO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SO YOU SENATOR AND- EVERYBODY AND THE AND THE CHAIR. IN TERMS OF ANY WAY YOU'D LIKE. TO MOVE TO SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND ARE WE HAVE AMONG. AND LABOR CENTER POUND. CONSULT OKAY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AB NINE FOUR ONE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS HER TADO I. FURTADO I'D JONES CORTESE VOTING. CORTESE NOT VOTING KAMLAGER HI COM LARGER AYE PAN AYE PAN AYE. WILL PLACE A BELONG COUGH TO LOAD THEIR STEPPING COOPER THANK YOU. AND I SEE WE HAVE A SLIM ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO IN THE ROOM- AND HE- IS HERE FOR AGENDA ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN. AND PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. HELLO OKAY RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS SAID THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT KNOWS FULL WELL- THE CHALLENGES WORLD HAVING AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND HOW CALIFORNIA- POLICYMAKERS FOR THE PUBLIC OR CONSTITUENTS HAVE NOT BEEN SATISFIED WITH GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE AND HOW MUCH WE NEED TO MAKE PROGRESS WITH DATA DRIVEN STRATEGIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THIS YEAR ARE BUDGET INCLUDES A HISTORICALLY UNPRECEDENTED TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS A FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS WHAT DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN ONGOING THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A LOCAL AND STATE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND HOLD BILL STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROGRESS IT DOESN'T IN THREE WAYS BY REQUIRING THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMPLETE THEY GAPS NEEDS ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS BASED ON THAT ANALYSIS STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CREATE AN ACTUAL PLAN TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS BY NINETY PERCENT. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY NINE AND THIS BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES AN INSPECTOR GENERAL POSITION THAT CAN HOLD THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR FAILING TO SUBMIT THIS PLAN OR NOT FOLLOWING A PLAN IN ADDITION TO HELP MEET THE STATEWIDE NEED TO CREATE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE XPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS THIS BILL WOULD PRIORITIZE FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND FOR PROJECTS SERVING PEOPLE. EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. BY HOLDING ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE. THIS BILL WILL HELP MOVE OUR STATE TOWARD HOPEFULLY FINALLY ADDRESSING THE MORAL CRISIS OF THE DAY. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES FROM THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE JULIE SNYDER. AND FROM CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SHAM REPORT. WITNESSES MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS TWO WEEKS LATER WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WE ARE EXTREMELY PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR AB ONE SIX TO CREATE ENFORCEABLE MANDATE TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS WE'RE DEEPLY GRATEFUL THE FINAL STATE BUDGET PRIORITIZED HOMELESSNESS WHICH OF CALIFORNIANS NUMBER ONE ISSUE ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM WHAT THAT INVESTMENT NEEDS NOW IS THE CONNECTING TISSUE THAT'LL ENSURE THE STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS LEVERAGE EACH OTHER'S STRENGTHS TO ACHIEVE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES. AB EIGHT ONE SIX IS THAT CONNECTING TISSUE FOR EXAMPLE YOUR STATE BUDGET PROVIDES TWO BILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY TO LOCALITIES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS SH EIGHT ONE SIX WOULD REQUIRE THAT THEY DEVELOP A REGIONAL GAPS A NEEDS ANALYSIS AS THE ROAD MAP TO SPEND THESE FUNDS AREN'T ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT MOVE PEOPLE QUICKLY INTO PERMANENT HOUSING AND NOT ONLY THAT TWO BILLION DOLLARS BUT ALSO THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION COUNTIES RECEIVED IN THE CAL WORK HOUSING PROGRAM THE TWO BILLION IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING EXTRA TRAFFIC STOP DROP. CORONATION OF THESE FUNDING STREAMS ALONE WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF MORE. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. DESPITE IS THE BILL'S PERCENT GOAL. WE CAN LOOK TO THE CITY OF BAKER'S FOR ANSWER. AT THE JANUARY DISHING. THE CITY ELIMINATED HOMELESSNESS THROUGH SECURE COLLABORATION WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT PARTNERS SHE PROBABLY DID IT IS FRANKLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT THEY FIGURED IT OUT AND THAT. WHAT AB EIGHT ONE SIX AND ABOUT THE CHARGES THE STATE IN EACH LOCALITY WITH DOING WHAT THEY CAN'T IN ANY WAY THEY FIND FEASIBLE THE BILL IS COMPLETELY FLEXIBLE ON THE HOUSE. BEYOND IT RECOGNIZES THAT JURISDICTIONS HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESOURCES. LOCAL REQUIREMENTS SHE EACH LOCALITY SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE GOAL WILL BE BASED ON WHAT YOU CAN REASONABLY ACCOMPLISH THREE ZONING BY USING EXISTING DOLLARS MORE EFFECTIVELY EXCEPT TRUCK AND I WANT TO REPEAT THAT BECAUSE I HEARD A LACK OF CLARITY FROM OPPONENTS ON THIS POINT. UNDER AB EIGHT ONE SIX EACH LOCALITIES PERFORMANCE GOAL WILL BE BASED ON WHAT THE APP LOCALITY CAN REASONABLY ACCOMPLISH. BUT IT SAYS THE STATE'S NO LONGER GOING TO ACCEPT INACTION OR INEFFECTIVE APPROACHES. TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCALS AB EIGHT ONE SIX ALSO CREEPS INSPECTOR GENERAL WHICH WILL HOLD ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR MEETING THE GOALS THAT THEY THAT. WE HOPE THE IG'S AMERICANS DISTANCE WILL CREATE THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO WHAT WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE WE URGE HER AYE VOTE ON THE STATIONARY MEASURE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS I WAS CHAIRMAN REPORT WITH APPROPRIATIONS FOR SUPPORT I THINK ANOTHER CONSTRUCTION. HOMELESSNESS IS SOLVABLE INTOXICATED STATE IN EIGHTY SEVEN CITIES HAVE ENTERED CONCORD VETERAN HOMELESSNESS AND FROM WHERE STATES LIKE MICHIGAN AND NEW JERSEY HAVE REDUCED TUMOR THICKNESS. THE SEVENTY OR 49% RESPECTIVELY. DO YOU MIND IF WE CANNOT PLACE WORK REQUIREMENTS LAST YEAR SPENDING ONE. CAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK UP. YES I'M SORRY CAN YOU HEAR ME BETTER NOW YES MUCH BETTER. OKAY OKAY- DO YOU SHOULD I START OVER OR PICK UP WHERE I LEFT US. YOU CAN PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF. OKAY WHAT WE NEED FUNDING TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT MUST USUALLY SPENDING WISELY TO END IT. FOR EXAMPLE STATE SET GOAL USE DATA TO INVEST COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE RESOURCES AND IDENTIFY AND REFORM FAILED POLICY. AB EIGHT SIXTEEN HOLD ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING WHAT WE NOW WORK IT FIRST REQUIRES THE STATE TO DO GAPS A NEEDS ANALYSIS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. WE HAVE A STATE WIDE HOMELESS DATA INFORMATION SYSTEMS KNOW WHO'S EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND WHERE PEOPLE GO WHEN THEY ACCESS IT WE NEXT NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY SHELTER PETS AND WE HOUSING RESOURCES WE HAVE. ANALYZE WHAT WE NEED AND IDENTIFY THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO. IT WILL ALSO PINPOINT HOW MANY PEOPLE WE EXPECT TO EXIT STATE FUNDED. INSTITUTIONS IN THE HOMELESSNESS. NAY THE NEED BEEN A GAME CHANGER FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA TOWARD HOUSE A TOWARD FOCUSING RESOURCES ON FILLING GAPS. IT SHOULD BE A NO BRAINER FOR CALIFORNIA. NEXT AB EIGHT SIXTEEN REQUIRES THE STATE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PUT IN PLACE TOOLS THEY NEED. FINALLY A. B. EIGHT SIXTEEN SET GOALS FOR EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT TO DO THE HARD WORK OF COLLABORATING LEVERAGING INVESTMENTS AND REFORMING POLICIES. THE ONLY WAY TO MEET THE VOTER PRIORITY TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IS TO DEDICATE CALIFORNIA TO AN ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH. AB EIGHT SIXTEEN IS THE CALL FOR ALL HANDS ON DECK TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY WILL BE MOVING TO PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE. SEEN NINE ROOM TWENTY FORTY.

BUT POLITICS FOR THE LATE LETTERS THE MIDDLE TO THE COMMITTEE BUT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN INJECTED A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS CONSIDERATION. WHICH EARNED TE GOLD IMPROVING THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS AND AGREE THAT PLANNING IS A MAJOR PART OF THE CHEATING MEASURABLE AND SUSTAINED PROGRESS. THAT REASON WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSORS AND STAFF LAST YEAR ON SIMILAR BILL AB THIRTY TO SIXTY NINE AFTER MANY VALUABLE CONVERSATIONS WE REMOVED OPPOSITION TO LAST YEAR'S BILL WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN. UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT CONTINUE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT WE STAND READY TO FULLY ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE THIS YEAR IN HOPES OF REACHING A SIMILAR COMMON GROUND THAT WE MET ON LAST YEAR. GENERALLY ARE CONCERNED WITH EIGHTY SIXTEEN OF THAT FALLS SHORT OF BEING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. CAN YOU AGREE THAT A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY SHOULD INCLUDE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF CLEARLY ARTICULATED GOALS DEFINED WORLD IN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR EACH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT COMMENSURATE ON GO ON GOING FUNDING TO FILL THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. AND TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. CERTAINLY WOULD BE A PART OF THAT AS WELL. EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN THE MAN FOR TOWN CHARGED. GO BY. OBTAINING PROCESS IN REGARD CARD. BUT ALSO ON ACCOUNTABLE MEASURES THREE WITH. THE HOUSING HOMELESS. INSPECTOR INTO COURT INTERVENTION PROCESS RELATED TO FUNDING AND EXPENDITURES. HOWEVER THE MEASURE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE OTHER ELEMENTS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOMES. THAT BEING SAID. WE DEFINITELY REALIZE THAT THAT DYNAMIC CONVERSATION AND- INVOLVING CONVERSATION EVOLVING CONVERSATION WITH THE HOMELESSNESS BUDGET TRAILER BILL NEGOTIATIONS ALSO OCCURRING AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE SINGING CALL. BUT THAT WE HAD. LAST YEAR WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF. AND SPONSORS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SURE JUST TO ANSWER BRIEFLY CENTER PANS- QUESTIONS SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SANDRA- AT THIS MOMENT IT IS A DYNAMIC CONVERSATION BECAUSE THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS GOING ON IN THE BUDGET TRAILER CONVERSATION. AROUND HOW WE ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS SAID WE'RE MOVING FORWARD AND- AND SOME OF THESE IDEAS ARE ARE IN PLAY- A FEW THINGS THAT- COUNTIES OF RAISES- A SITUATION THAT SOMEHOW THERE AREN'T CLEAR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS WHAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR. IS FOR EVERY CITY COUNTY REGION AND STATE AGENCY TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF GAPS IN NEEDS ANALYSIS OF WHAT IS THE NEED. HOW MUCH RESOURCES ARE ADDRESSING THIS NEED WHAT'S THE GAP BETWEEN THAT SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW ALL THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS ALL FIT TOGETHER AND WORK ASKING ALL THESE PLAYERS. TO WORK TOGETHER SO FOR EXAMPLE MANY FOR COUNTIES HAVE EMBEDDED CITIES. CITIES SAY THE COUNTIES OUGHT TO DO ONE ASPECT OF IT THE COUNTY SAY CITIES OUT TO DO AN ASPECT OF IT PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST GET EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE WHAT. SKIN IN THE GAME ARE YOU PUTTING INTO THIS WHAT ARE YOU NOT SO THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE IN A VERY TRANSPARENT WAY WHAT'S GOING ON WE CAN'T. EXACTLY DEFINED ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES UNTIL WE DO THAT ANALYSIS SO PART OF THIS BILL SAYS LET'S DO THE ANALYSIS AND THEN LET'S PUT THE PLAN TOGETHER TO MOVE THAT FORWARD- ONE OTHER MAJOR ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED AS- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HOLD CITIES AND COUNTIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR AND I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR BECAUSE- WE'VE HEARD FROM CITIES. IF YOU DON'T GIVE US ENOUGH MONEY WE CAN'T AND HOMELESSNESS THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY STATES. THAT JURISDICTION'S WILL ONLY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE IF THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT FOR SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE'RE GETTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF VALUE FROM THAT SO. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MAIN ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN BUT AS I'VE SAID BEFORE THE CONVERSATIONS ON GOING- I THINK WHEN THE DUST SETTLES AFTER BUDGET TRAILER HOPEFULLY THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS- WE'LL GET BACK. TO REALLY FINE TUNING WHERE WE ARE WITH THIS ALL. THANK YOU. AND AGAIN JUST EVERYONE'S- SUPPORT OF THIS IF YOU CAN- WE SPENT DECADES INVESTING IN HOMELESSNESS BUT NOT ANY HOMELESSNESS AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO REALLY HAVE A PLAN TO- TO MAKE A MOVE TO ACTUALLY ENDED AND THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THIS AND USING THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE WILL HAVE THIS YEAR AND INTO THE FUTURE- AND WITH THAT A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- SENATORS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB THREE SIXTY SIX WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DIRECTION TO KEEP SIBLINGS TOGETHER AND THE FOSTER YOU SYSTEM I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES- WORK ON THIS AND I ACCEPT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS- THERE ARE VARYING COMPLEXITIES FOR SIBLINGS WITH THE FOSTER SYSTEM FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. AND IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE VALUE OF PRIORITIZING SIBLINGS BEING PLACED TOGETHER ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL CHILDREN'S BUREAU THIRTY SEVEN STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA REQUIRE CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES TO MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PLAY SOAP SIBLINGS TOGETHER. IN THE ABSENCE OF A DOCUMENT SAFETY DOCUMENTED SAFETY AND WELL BEING CONCERNS ALTHOUGH MANY STATES IDENTIFY CAPACITY OF THE BARRIER TO SIBLING PLACEMENT IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT ANY OTHER STATE HAS GONE SO FAR AS TO CREATE A POLICY THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES. TO THE ADDRESS OF THE CAPACITY RELATED BARRIERS TO SIBLING PLACEMENT CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW PROVIDES THAT CHILDREN SHALL BE PLACED WITH SIBLINGS UNLESS IT IS THE DETRIMENTAL AND THERE IS A STRONG STATUTORY PREFERENCE FOR RELATIVE PLACEMENT. IN PRACTICE HOWEVER TOO MANY CHILDREN REMAIN SEPARATED FROM THEIR SIBLINGS AND RELATIVES DUE TO THE BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO CHILD SAFETY OR UNNECESSARY DELAYS. IN ASSESSING RELATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE SETS OF SIBLINGS ARE OFTEN SEPARATED INTO DIFFERENT HOMES NOT DUE TO SAFETY. CONCERNS BUT INSTEAD BECAUSE OF CAPACITY RESTRICTIONS IN THE LAW. THIS CAN HAVE LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES A LARGE SIBLING GROUPS WHO ARE CLOSELY BONDED TO EACH OTHER BUT ARE TRAUMATIZED AGAINST. AGAIN BY THE LOSS OF THEIR SIBLINGS INTO A SEPARATE HOME. AB THREE SIXTY SIX WOULD REMEDY THE ISSUES BY INSURING SIBLINGS SHOULD BE PLACED TOGETHER UNLESS THERE IS A SHOWING THAT. PLACEMENT WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE WELL BEING AND SAFETY OF THE SIBLINGS AND APPROVE RESOURCE. FAMILIES I HAD THE SIZE AND SPACE TO PLAY SIBLINGS TOGETHER ADJUSTMENTS ARE EXISTING SYSTEM WILL ALLOW A SIMPLE FIX TO A CRITICAL ASPECT OF FIVE FOSTER YOUTH OUTCOMES.
