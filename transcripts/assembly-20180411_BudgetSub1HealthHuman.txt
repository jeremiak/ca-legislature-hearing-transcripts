GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS WILL BEGIN TODAY SOMEONE HEARING ON APRIL ELEVENTH. AND BEFORE I BEGAN I'D LIKE TO TAKE A TERRACE PREROGATIVE AND THANK SOMEONE WHO IS A TREMENDOUS WRITER AND DOESN'T GET ENOUGH RECOGNITION. BUT BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA THOUGH HAS BEEN SOMEONE WHO OUR OFFICE. REALLY LEANS ON AND REALLY WANTED TO SHARE A SPECIAL THANK YOU WITH HIM FOR. EVERYTHING THAT YOU SEE HERE ON THIS AGENDA. WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN WITH ISSUE ONE BUT I KNOW IN ONE THANK YOU. VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS FOR ENTERTAINING THIS ITEM THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT MY REQUEST TO INCREASE FUNDING. FOR THE DEAF ACCESS PROGRAM. FROM FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. TWO EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION. WHICH REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF FOUR POINT ONE MILLION FOR THE PROGRAM. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE DEAF ACCESS PROGRAM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. TO PROVIDE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING INDIVIDUALS. WITH THE COMMUNICATION SERVICES THEY NEED. TO ACCESS THE STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS TO WHICH THEY ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM REACHED HOWEVER FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM WAS CUT DURING THE RECESSION. AND REDUCED AGAIN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AS A RESULT OF FEDERAL SEQUESTRATION. OVERALL THE DEATH ACCESS PROGRAM HAS LOST A TOTAL OF ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN. THIS IS LEFT THE PROGRAM AT ITS CURRENT FUNDING LEVEL OF FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION. IN ADDITION TO RESTORING THE FUNDING THE PROGRAM HAS LOST. I'M ALSO REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO ALLOW AGENCIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO WHAT ARE CALLED LINGUISTICALLY. ISOLATED HOUSEHOLDS WHICH CURRENTLY ARE NOT RECEIVING SERVICES DUE TO A FUNDING SHORTAGE. A LINGUISTICALLY ISOLATED HOUSEHOLD. REFERS TO A HOUSEHOLD IN WHICH NO ONE FOURTEEN YEARS OR OLDER SPEAKS ENGLISH QUOTE VERY WELL. ALONG WITH THIS FUNDING REQUEST I AM PROPOSING BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW CONTRACTS THAT DEAF ACCESS PROGRAM AGENCIES OPERATE. TO BE RENEWED EVERY FIVE YEARS RATHER THAN ANNUALLY. THIS WILL GRANT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FLEXIBILITY IN THE CONTRACT RENEWAL PROCESS. AND IT WILL RELIEVE SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THAT AGENCIES FACE WHEN RENEWING THEIR CONTRACTS EACH YEAR. I MYSELF AM HEARING IMPAIRED. AND THIS ISSUE IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME THIS IS MY SECOND YEAR WORKING TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR THIS DEAF ACCESS PROGRAM. I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING INDIVIDUALS HAVE FULL ACCESS. THE COMMUNICATION SERVICES THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR UNDER STATE LAW. I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY MICHELLE BRONSON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING SERVICE CENTER IN FRESNO.

THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME ISSUES THAT YOU COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO ARE GOING TO SOME DETAIL ON. ALL OF THEM THERE ARE NOT ANY QUESTIONS IN THE BUDGET. IN THE IN THE PACKAGE SO. WE DON'T TALK HAVE A. PAIRED OUR ANSWER TO THIS NO ANSWER TO THAT. ALL OF THEM ARE JUST SORT OF NOTE IN SORT OF OVERALL PREFERENCE THAT. CONTINUOUS CARE REFORM IS A SORT OF. AND INFLIGHT ARM INITIATIVE THAT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY NOW FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR. ALL IT HAS MANY MANY MOVING PARTS THEY ARE ALL EXTREMELY INTERACTIVE. HOMES THEY CAN'T BE. COMPLETELY SYNCHRONIZED IN THE SENSE OF EVERYTHING DOESN'T HAPPEN AT ONCE WE CAN'T FLIP A SWITCH AND GO FROM. THE SYSTEM THAT WAS TO THE SYSTEM THAT WILL BE RATHER IT'S A MATTER OF BRINGING IN. ON THE IN IN THE BEST HOME POSSIBLE. WAY THE COMPONENTS THAT SUPPORT THE WORK THAT'S JUST GONE BEFORE IN THE WORKED JUST ABOUT TO HAPPEN. ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU CAN SORT OF SAY WITH COMPLETE CERTAINTY THAT I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WEEK AFTER NEXT. ON THE WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE SORT OF THE TEAM WHO HAS WORKED ON IMPLEMENTATION BOTH OF THEM FROM THE STATE. DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THE STATE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENT OF THE GOOD WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES ON DAY PROVIDER COMMUNITY VIA. THE ALLIANCE ON HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY ATTENTIVE AND SORT OF MEETS ON A SERVER WORKS ON US INTERACTIVELY A SEMI CONSTANT BASIS. THAT WHICH IS LAUNCHED IS QUICKLY ADJUSTED AND ALL HOME FINE TUNED. ALONE AND THE. I I THINK THE PARTNERSHIP WILL THOUGH IT FACES MANY CHALLENGES MANY HURDLES ON IS OUR RESOLVING THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AS AS THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES SO WITHOUT A SORT OF THE. PARENT REDUCTION I'VE GOT ASSUME YOU'RE NOT WITH CCR ISN'T WHY WE'RE DOING IT. ALL AND RATHER ALSO TO SEE IF THERE ARE PARTICULAR AREAS THAT THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO ON EXPLORE. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM FRANK MICA. THANKS MISTER CHAIR FRANK MAC EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND. CCR IS A HUGE AUDACIOUS EFFORT AND ONE THAT WERE QUITE PROUD OF. AND FULLY COMMITTED TO IN FACT OUR STAFF. CO CHAIRED THAT. GROUP THAT MADE THE RECOMMENDATIONS MANY OF WHICH EAD TO ULTIMATELY TO CC ARE. THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BUILT ON A LOT OF PROMISING PRACTICES THAT WERE IN PLACE LEADING UP TO CCR. ARM AND AS THE AGENDA DESCRIBES CCAR'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS IT'S REALLY NOT ONE REFORM. IT'S ACTUALLY NO FEWER THAN SIX REFORMS EACH ONE OF WHICH. IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT EFFORT IT'S AN EXPANSION OF INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE. THE COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT AND EXECUTE CONGREGATE CARE. IT'S A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE WAY WE BET AND APPROVED FAMILIES. HOW TO CARE FOR FOSTER KIDS? IT'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REFORMS TO THE WAY WE ASSESS THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THE WAY WE DO CASE WORK OTHER WHERE SOCIAL WORKERS DO CASE WORK. IT'S A BRAND NEW RATE SETTING SYSTEM FOR PROVIDERS I'M AND IT'S REALLY AN UNPRECEDENTED DEGREE AT SORT INTEGRATION WITH THE BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE. ARM AND IT WAS ALWAYS IT WAS ALSO PUT ON AN EXTRAORDINARILY AMBITIOUS TIMELINE ON THE ONLY. THE ONLY ARMED SERVICES HAVE TO MY TAKE TO MISTER LIKE PRINCE COMMENT WHEN HE SAID IT FEELS LIKE WHEN IS THAT A SEMI CONSTANT STATE OF MEETING IN ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE. APPEALS LIKE IT'S A CONSTANT STATE OF OUR ENGAGEMENT NO SAMMY HERE AT ALL NAM AND THE THE PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN VERY STRONG THIS IS A LOT OF WORK. ARM FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED FOR THE STATE FOR THE COUNTIES FOR PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY FOR. OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ARM IN IMPLEMENTING DOT CCR. COM AND AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THERE SOME AREAS WHERE WE'VE HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THE DELAYS IN THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS THAT YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ALREADY. ON BUT THAT'S ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT MR LIKE PORN DISCUSSED WHERE WE MADE MYTH MID COURSE CORRECTIONS WE IDENTIFIED SOME THINGS THAT WEREN'T WORKING ON WE MADE SOME CHANGES TO. ON TO TRY TO IMPROVE THINGS. SO I MEAN OVERALL THE ARC OF CCR IS PROBABLY WHAT WE'D EXPECT AND WE DO WANT TO RAISE SORT OF ONE. ARM ISSUE FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATION AND I THINK WE'LL ELUCIDATED MORON. DIFFERENT BUDGET PROPOSALS ARM BETTER THAT ARE COMING FORWARD. SO THE KEY COMPONENT OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF CCAR'S THIS TWELVE THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN DEADLINE. I'M AFTER WHICH GROUP HOMES AS WE KNEW THEM ARE NO LONGER. AND. CHILDREN SHOULD NEED TO BE PLACED WITH FAMILIES OR INTO SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT ARE FOR ABOUT THERAPY NOT HOUSING. HOUSING KITS. THAT THEORY ASSUMES THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF BOTH S. T. R. TEEPEES PARDON THE ACRONYM. AND THOSE INTENSIVE FAMILY HOMES TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS. OF THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED OR SO A KID IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM I'M WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN GROUP HOMES. I'M WE HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT THE ADEQUATE NUMBER OF PLACEMENTS WILL BE AVAILABLE BY THAT TWELVE THIRTY ONE DEADLINE. TOM AND IF WE COULD SERVE LAYOUT ARM. THE BASIS FOR THOSE CONCERNS. ARMED DATA THERAPEUTIC FAMILY BASED SETTINGS ON FOSTER FAMILIES THE WRAPPED AROUND WITH A LOT OF SERVICES ARE. TREATMENT FOSTER CARE AND INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE. BOB WE'VE NOT SEEN THE PROGRESS IN RECRUITING AND PUTTING THOSE FAMILIES ONLINE THAT WE HELPED. I'M TREATMENT FOSTER CARE IS. CLOSE TO NONEXISTENT AND INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE. BOB WE'RE NOT GETTING THE RESPONSE WE'RE WORKING HARD ON IT BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING THE RESPONSE. THAT WE HOPE THAT TO SOME DEGREE THIS IS JUST IMPLEMENTATION REALITY THAT AYE SFC. STATE INSTRUCTIONS JUST CAME OUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SO I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A PERMANENT STATE OF AFFAIRS. BUT THE BUT THE SLOW START GIVEN THAT TWELVE THIRTY ONE IT'S NOT THAT FAR AWAY. IS WORRISOME AND SO THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN IS THAT THE RATE OF CONVERSION OF GROUP HOMES INTO STR TEEPEES. I THINK THE LATEST DATA SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED. S. T. RTP BEDS AND I HATE THAT TERM THEIR PLACEMENT OPTIONS THERAPEUTIC PLACEMENT OPTIONS IN S. T. R. TEEPEES FOR YOU. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED KIDS IN THOSE FACILITIES NOW. I'M WE DON'T EXPECT ALL THOSE. GROUP HOMES TO CONVERT ES CHARITY PEACE BECAUSE THE THEORY OF CCR THAT SOME NUMBER OF THOSE CHILDREN SHOULD BE PLACED. IN THERAPEUTIC FAMILY BASED SETTINGS. BUT THAT BUT THE SIZE OF THAT DISCONNECT. COUPLED WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE NUMBER OF RESOURCE FAMILIES THAT WE HAVE. GIVES US GIVES US REASON FOR CONCERN. ARM AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THROUGH THIS GROSS NUMBER OF S. T. RTP. PLACEMENT OPTIONS THIRTEEN HUNDRED. BOB DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THEY ARE ALL AVAILABLE FOR FOSTER CARE. I AM SO FOR EXAMPLE. NAM SAID. THE CITY HAS TO BE IN A LOCATION THAT'S CLOSE TO THE BACK KIDS WHO NEED. THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE YOUTH FOR EXAMPLE WE WOULD WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE. WE HAVE A YOUTH WHOSE. THERE'D THEIR TREATMENT NEEDS IN THEIR STRENGTHS AND THEIR THEIR THEIR ISSUES WOULD SUGGEST A FACILITY WOULD BE A GOOD TRIP TREATMENT FACILITY AND WILL HERE. ARM WE TAKE GIRLS NOT PORTS AND THAT'S THE WAY THEY ORGANIZED THEIR PROGRAM THAT'S THAT'S THEIR SPECIALTY. I'M WE ALSO KNOW THAT THAT ES CHARITY PEAK CAPACITY IS NOT JUST FOR KIDS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. THERE'S THAT FACILITY THAT WE NEVER RECENTLY TALKED ABOUT WHERE I THINK THEY HAD SEVENTY FIVE. A PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES ONLY TWENTY OF WHICH. ARM OR BEING FELT BY THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THE REST WERE EITHER PRIVATE PAY. CLIENTS OR CLIENTS FROM THE EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM THAT. BOB SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM. ARM AND SO. NAM. THAT WE. WE HAVE TO CONSTANTLY SORT OF REFINE THIS. PROJECTING ARE WE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH. PLACEMENT OPTIONS WE HAVE TO HAVE A A MORE REFINED LOOK AT IT AND JUST SORT OF THE NUMBERS. WE ALSO HAVE AN ISSUE THAT WERE COUNTIES ARE REPORTING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF S. T. RTP THESE ARE ACTUAL GROUPON THAT HAVE CONVERTED. WHO ARE NOT ACCEPTING OUR OUR PLACEMENTS WILL CALMNESS WILL LAY OUT A NEED ENOUGH SAY THAT WE THAT THAT CHILD DOESN'T DOESN'T MEET OUR PROFILE OR THEY'LL REJECT EGX REJECTS? THE TERM WE USE. ACROSS NINE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES THAT WE SURVEYED. SINCE JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR FORTY ONE CHILDREN WERE EITHER REJECTED OR EACH ACTED BY THOSE FACILITIES. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT EVERYONE OF THOSE OBJECTIONS ARE REJECTIONS WAS INAPPROPRIATE. BUT IT IS TO SAY AS WE REALLY THINK ABOUT DO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO BE COMFORTABLE THAT WARM TWELVE THIRTY ONE HIT. TOM WE HAVE THE TREATMENT CAPACITY WE HAVE TO REALLY DIG DEEPER. INTO INTO THE NUMBERS AND SO. AND THE BOTTOM LINE CONCERN FOR US IS THAT. IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY. POR EITHER IN INTENSIVE FAMILY BASED SETTINGS OR IN GOOD HIGH QUALITY STR TEEPEES. KIDS COULD BE PLACED OUT OF STATE THEY COULD STAY LONGER IN TEMPORARY SHELTERS WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT IDEAL. IF WE TRY TO PLACE THOSE CHILDREN WITH FAMILIES WHO DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPORTS. WE COULD BURDEN AND BURNOUT THOSE FAMILIES AND RESULT IN PLACEMENT MOVES THAT. BREACH FROM THAT RE TRAUMATIZE THE YOUTH. OR IF THE COURTS A AND THE LAW ALLOWS THAT WE CONTINUE TO USE GROUP HOMES THAT DON'T CONVERT. I'M INTO STR TEEPEES WE'D BE DOING SO WITHOUT ANY FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT WOULD BE LOSING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WOULD DRAIN THAT WOULD THEN DRAIN RESOURCE AWAY FROM OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM. SO SORT OF. BOTTOM LINE CONCERN FOR US THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO MONITOR WITH THE STATE AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TOM IS THAT WE DON'T DO HARM. AT A MINIMUM WE SHED HIPPOCRATIC STANDARD AND CCR. AND. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IS COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO THAT GOAL ARM. FROM THE FRONT LINES THE PEOPLE ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM AT THE FRONT LINES ON BEHALF OF THE STATE IN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SS. WE THINK THERE'S REASON. FOR US TO EXAMINE AND START TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT CONTINGENCY PLANS WE MIGHT MAKE IF? WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FACILITIES AND HIGH QUALITY FAMILIES TO PREVENT CHILDREN FROM UNWITTINGLY AND UNINTENTIONALLY BEING WORSE OFF BY CC ARE NOT BETTER. THANK YOU SIR. NEXT WE HAVE SANDRA. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ON SUNDAY BEGAN A HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTOR IN KINGS COUNTY. AREN'T KINGS COUNTY IS A MEDIUM SIZE ON VALLEY COUNTY WITH A POPULATION OF ABOUT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND WE'RE BORDERED BY FRESNO. TULARE AND KERN COUNTIES. AND CURRENTLY IN OUR COUNTY WE HAVE ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE KIDS IN CARE AND THAT'S THE COUNTY WE HAVE TRULY EMBRACE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CCR AND PUT FRANKLY WE'VE DONE RATHER WELL SO FAR. WE WERE ONE OF THE EARLY RFA IMPLEMENTERS SO I'M GONNA. APOLOGIZE FOR THE ACRONYM UP. RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL SO BEASTLY STARTED WITH FOUR OTHER COUNTIES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND ESSENTIALLY HAD A TWO YEAR HEAD START ABOVE. UP AHEAD OF OTHER COUNTIES WHICH REALLY IS WHAT'S ALLOWING ME TO SAY TODAY THAT FIFTY THREE PERCENT OF OUR KIDS ARE PLACED IN OUR FACE. AND EVERY FORMER FOSTER HOME AND A RELATIVE. HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO AN RFA PLACEMENT. PART OF OUR SUCCESS WAS ALSO THAT WE'VE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OUR ALLIANCE IN GROUP HOMES TWO YEARS AGO KINGS COUNTY HAD TWENTY SIX KIDS IN GROUP HOMES AND TODAY WE HAVE SEVEN. AND PART OF THE SUCCESS WAS REALLY THE NUMBER OF EFFORTS THAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE. EMBRACE THE CALIFORNIA COURT PRACTICE MODEL WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SAFETY ORGANIZED PRACTICE WHICH REALLY HAS GIVEN US A GOOD FOUNDATION ON THE SIDE OF CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS. WE'VE IMPROVED OUR FAMILY FINDING AND. IT WAS THERE ARE IF OUR IT WAS THE CCR RESOURCE OF VAPORS THAT REALLY ALLOWED FOR THAT. AND WE WORKED WITH OUR LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO IMPROVE OUR APPS SERVICES. BUT DESPITE ALL OF THOSE SUCCESSES WE'VE. CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING CCR AND PART OF THAT IS THAT WE STILL STRUGGLE WITH PLACEMENT OF ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION. WE HAVE OVER THE PAST YEAR AT ANY GIVEN TIME SEVEN TO TEN KIDS IN GROUP HOMES THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO STEP DOWN. WE HAVE ABOUT TEN KIDS THAT ARE EITHER FREQUENT RUN RUNAWAYS OR A BALL AND ABOUT FIFTEEN KIDS THAT. IN OUR COUNTY WE HAVE. WORKED THROUGH MULTIPLE MOVES BECAUSE WE'RE UNABLE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SERVICES TO STABILIZE AND THEIR CURRENT SETTING. AND PART OF THIS FOR A COUNTY REALLY IS THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO AYE SFC HOMES AND I COUNTY OR TREATMENT FOSTER CARE HOMES IN OUR COUNTY. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES THEY HAVE A FEW BUT THEY'RE FULLY UTILIZED BY THOSE COUNTIES. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND NINE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES OUT OF GOTTEN TOGETHER TO REALLY LOOK AT AND WAY OUR NEEDS VERSUS OUR RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES TO INTENSIVE SERVICE HOMES. AND WE'VE COME UP WITH AN ESTIMATED NEED A FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOMES AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE HUNDRED AND SEVEN. SO WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR NEEDS MET AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WHEN WE LOOKED AT SUFFICIENT S. THE RTP IS WHEN ABOUT THE SAME. LEVEL SO ARE. IT WOULD WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE A PLACEMENT OPTIONS. PART OF IT IS FOR US BEEN KINGS COUNTY WE WERE TRYING TO PLACE A CHILD IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PLACE IN COUNTY WITH AN RFA. UP WE ARE LOOKING IMMEDIATELY TO FRESNO AND TULARE GROUP HOMES BECAUSE IN OUR COUNTY WE DO NOT HAVE ANY STR TEEPEES AND HAVE ONLY A SINGLE GROUP HOME. WAIT THAT SERVES VERY SPECIALIZED POPULATION. AND A PART OF MY CONCERN REALLY IS WHAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO IS WHILE WE'RE DOING THIS REALLY IN A MULTIPLE LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION OF. CCR DEBTS WAY BEYOND JUST THE PLACEMENT IS THAT AT THE MOMENT WHEN WE'RE SEARCHING FOR PLACEMENT WHERE PLACING KIDS IN UP HERE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE. AND WHAT HAPPENS M. IN THOSE INSTANCES IS WE REALLY THEN END UP WITH MULTIPLE PLACEMENTS WHICH WE THEN RE TRAUMATIZE. WE END UP. REALLY DEFLATING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES BECAUSE WILL WE ARE MOVING KIDS CONSTANTLY THERE'S JUST NO THERE'S REALLY NO REAL. CAPACITY TO KEEP THOSE SERVICES GOING SO DELAYS OF REUNIFICATION DELAYS CARE WE EXPOSE KIDS TO SELF HARM AND QUITE HONESTLY HAVE EXPOSED OUR SOCIAL WORKERS. DID THE SAME THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE HAD A SOCIAL WORKER HEARD BY A CHILD. IS. WAIT HAS HAPPENED WAY TOO FREQUENTLY IN THE PAST YEAR. AND WHILE I THINK OUR SOCIAL WORKERS ARE GREAT THEY REALLY DO NOT HAVE THE SKILL SET TO A TIME. UP PART OF THE OTHER ITEMS SITUATIONS WE'VE ENCOUNTERED IS WHEN WE UTILIZE OUR A PHASE THAT REALLY STEP UP AND WANT TO HELP. BUT WHEN THEY'RE NOT CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF AT PROVIDING THERAPEUTIC SERVICES WHERE THAN DESTROYING THAT RELATIONSHIP AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE REALIZING THAT THEY CANNOT. SERVE THE KIDS THE WAY THEY ARE. YOU AND A STEP AWAY SO THEM LOSE A RESOURCE THAT OURS REALLY HARD TO FIND AND AND WE'VE WORKED THROUGH TO PUT THROUGH AND I THINK PROCESS. UP AND AT THE END OF THAT OF CERTAINLY NOT COUNTY IN A NUMBER OF OTHERS WE'VE ENDED UP WITH KIDS AND ON THE GROUP HOME PLACEMENTS. THAT ARE ARTISTS THE GROUP HOME PLACEMENT AND CURRENTLY I HAVE COUPLE KIDS IN THAT SITUATION. AND WHILE THEY'RE DOING BETTER WHERE THEY'RE AT ON I'M HAVE A HUGE CONCERN OF THOSE FACILITIES HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED THE TRANSITION TO AT THE ACTIVITIES. SO AM I DON'T WANNA SOUND WILL ALONG I DON'T WANNA MAKE IT SOUND LIKE SEVERELY DIRE BUT A VERY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY GOOD EFFORT THAT'S HAPPENING ON ABSOLUTELY GRATEFUL THAT WE WERE AN EARLY RFA IMPLEMENTER BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE CAN TURN AROUND AND REALLY FOCUS ON. OUR OUR IF FOUR EYES THAT SEE HOMES AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF CDSS ARM GETTING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN AN OF. RALLYING THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO DO A STATEWIDE RFPS AND OUR THIGHS FOR SERVICES TO YOUTH THAT ARE OF BOTH DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED AND HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR TO SIR RC SEC YOUTH. BECAUSE AT FROM A STATE BY PERSPECTIVE THAT SERVICES POSSIBLE TO GARNER AT THE COUNTY OUR SIZE WE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO CREATE CAPACITY AND KEEP SOMETHING LIKE THAT GOING JUST WITHIN A SINGLE COUNTY LEVEL. PART OF THE ISSUES REALLY THE TIMING WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY SO THAT'S AYE AYE. COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND ECHO THAT CONCERNED THAT WHERE WE ARE NOW IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO UP MEET ALL THE NEEDS WE HAVE. SO I. THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME OR SITE AND APPRECIATE ALL THE RESOURCES THAT BEEN. APPROVED SO FAR FOR THIS IMPLEMENTATION THANK YOU MA'AM. NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR PATTERSON BAR LOW ANGIE SPORTS AND SUSANNA. NEFYN IF WE CAN MAKE A WE HAVE ONE EXTRA CHAIR SO DESTINY ADAMS YOU CAN COME UP AS WELL WHEN YOU'RE READY MISS PART OF GOOD AFTERNOON I'M KRISTIN BARLOWE AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND PLEASED TO BE HERE TO. SHARE WITH YOU WHAT THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SO FAR OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNTERPARTS AND TO THE INDIVIDUALS YOU JUST HEARD FROM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND JUST WANTED TO START BY SAYING THAT THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LEADERS IN OUR STATE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE INTENT IN GOALS BEHIND CC ARE. WE AGREE COMPLETELY THAT TO PROMOTE THE EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF CHILDREN HAVING THEM BE IN A FAMILY LIKE SETTING WITH THE SUPPORTIVE AND CARING ADULTS REALLY IS AND IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS. AS WELL AS TO ENSURE THAT FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY TRAUMA THAT THEY GET THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT WILL REALLY ADDRESS THOSE THINGS. AND ANOTHER THING WE HAVE IN COMMON I THINK WITH OUR TRIAL OFFER COUNTERPARTS ITS FAMILIARITY WITH THE UNACCEPTABLE PHENOMENON OF FAILING UP OR FAILING FIRST IN ORDER TO GET CARE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HISTORICALLY IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE HAVE A CHILDREN SYSTEM OF CARE ACT THAT GOES BACK ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. GIVEN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH GOES BACK AROUND FOURTEEN YEARS WITHIN THAT. ARE REALLY GOALS AROUND KEEPING PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN IN HOME IN THE COMMUNITY. AND AS NORMAL A LIFE. AS ANY ONE OF US WOULD EVER WANT TO HAVE SO THOSE CONCEPTS ARE CERTAINLY NOT NEW TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE TOTALLY EMBRACE THOSE GOALS OF THAT CCR INITIATIVE. THEY WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS OF. WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS ROLES ARE CC ARE IT DOESN'T ALTOGETHER CHANGE OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR SERVING MENTAL HEALTH CARE BUT IT DOES I THINK. CREATE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO PROVIDE MORE ROBUST CARE AND MORE COLLABORATIVE CARE AND PART WITH CHILD WELFARE IN PROBATION AND AS YOU WELL KNOW AND FROM THE HEARING EARLIER THIS WEEK. THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AROUND OUR STATE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY ALREADY TO PROVIDE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO KIDS AS PART OF THEIR EP STT MENTAL HEALTH BENEFIT IN THESE CHILDREN HAVE MEDI CAL IS THE COVERAGE SO. THEY ARE OUR KIDS THEY'RE NOT SIMPLY THAT SYSTEMS OR THOSE. HOWEVER A LOT OF THE ATTENDANCE OF CC ARE REALLY BUILD UPON THINGS THAT THE MEDICAL SYSTEM WAS MOVING TOWARD BECAUSE OF ACADIE A LAWSUIT. AND IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY I THINK TO THE GOALS OF CCR. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE TECHNICALLY BUT. DON'T WANNA FOR A BUNCH OF ACRONYMS THAT YOU I'M JUST TO SAY THAT THOSE THREE SERVICES REALLY ALREADY BEGIN TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR EXPECTING THAT CHILDREN GET CARE IN HOME BASED SETTINGS. THAT WE HAVE THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY TRAINED TO TAKE HIGHER NEED. CHILDREN INTO THEIR HOME AND THAT WE SUPPORT THEM NOT. LEAVE THEM THERE AND HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT THAT WE'RE DOING THINGS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SUPPORTING NOT ONLY THE CHILD BUT THE CAREGIVER. AND IS WELL INTENSIVE CASE COORDINATION WHERE WE'RE WORKING ALONGSIDE OUR PARTNERS NOT JUST MEETING THE THERAPEUTIC NEEDS BUT REALLY LOOKING AT A PARTNERSHIP MODEL. SO AS A RESULT OF CC ARE THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE BEING TASKED TO PROVIDE AND WE DO SUBSTANTIALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDED STATE GENERAL FUNDS. IN THE JANUARY BUDGET FOR US TO IMPLEMENT THESE THINGS OF THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL BE REIMBURSED BASED ON THEIR CLAIMS FOR THESE THREE NEW AREAS. ONE OF THEM IS THAT AS I'M TO THE EXTENT WE ARE THE MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN FOR A CHILD. AND THE FACT THAT EVERY CHILD WILL HAVE A CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM WHO MEETS TO DISCUSS. THAT CHILD'S NEEDS THE MENTAL HEALTH STAFF WILL BE A PART OF THOSE MEETINGS AND I HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO BE A PART OF THOSE MEETINGS. WE ALSO ARE ASKED TO DO MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS FOR ANY CHILD PRIOR TO THEM BEING PLACED IN ONE OF THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS. AND THEN LASTLY. AND PROBABLY AN AREA OF A LOT OF. LEARNING CURVING GROWTH FOR OUR PROVIDER COMMUNITY IS MEDI CAL CERTIFICATION SO TO ENSURE THAT ON THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS AND THE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES WHO ARE OVERSEEING THESE THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE HOMES. BUT THOSE THINGS ARE WHICH ARE MEDI CAL BILLABLE AND SPECIALTY MINIMAL SERVICES CAN IN FACT BE REIMBURSED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S MATCHING FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US SO. THAT'S A BIG AREA OF LEARNING HOW TO DOCUMENT AND AND DO THINGS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW AND IN SOME CASES MUCH MORE BUREAUCRATIC THAN WHAT WE MIGHT THINK OF AS WHAT YOU DO TO PROVIDE A LOVING HOME FOR A CHILD BUT THEY ARE NOT SUCH A NECESSARY FOR US TO MAXIMIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN DRAW DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR THESE THINGS. A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I THINK WE WANT A HIGH LATER GOING PARTICULARLY WELL. WHEN WHICH I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT IS HEARD ME SAY IN OTHER VENUES SAYS HOW IMPRESSED OUR. DIRECTORS ARE IN THE SOUTH OF OUR ASSOCIATION WITH THE LEVEL OF TIME A COMMITMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HAS REALLY. PUT FORTH ON TO ENSURE THAT THEIR VISION ACTUALLY HAS A CHANCE OF GETTING ACCOMPLISHED AND REALLY TAKING A VERY I'M COLLABORATIVE APPROACH DOING ONE ON ONE PHONE CALLS WITH COUNTIES AND. THE DIRECTOR HIMSELF. REALLY SPENDING THE TIME ON OF YOU KNOW BI WEEKLY BASIS WITH A TEAM OF PEOPLE THAT INCLUDES US I'M INVITING INTO THE DEPARTMENT A CONSULTANT. FROM OUR ASSOCIATION TO REALLY BE THE EYES AND EARS OF MENTAL HEALTH WITHIN THIS CONTEXT AND REALLY TRYING TO TROUBLESHOOT IN. VERY EARNESTLY THE ISSUES THAT SOMETIMES. ARISE AND CONTINUE TO RISE I'M SOMETIMES DAILY. ABOUT THINGS WE HEAR ARE GOING WELL OR NOT SO WELL IN COUNTIES AND REALLY TRYING TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS RATHER THAN TAKE A PUNITIVE APPROACH. IS REALLY KIND OF UNPRECEDENTED AND I ALSO THINK THAT IN TERMS OF CHALLENGES WE NEED TO YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THOSE THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT FROM THE CHILD WELFARE AND PERSPECTIVE. BUDGETING AND PLANNING FOR THIS FOR MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT THE PLACERS OF CHILDREN INTO THE SETTINGS HOWEVER WE ARE THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WANTS THOSE PLACEMENTS OCCUR. AND BECAUSE WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE HOW MANY OF THESE SHORT TERM THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS OR THERAPEUTIC FOSTER PARENTS WILL END UP BEING RECRUITED. IT'S UNCERTAIN YET HAS TO THE VOLUME OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH THAT WILL COME ALONG WITH THOSE TYPES OF PLACEMENTS BEING UTILIZED. ANDADDITIONALLY I WOULD JUST SAY THERE ARE. ALREADY EXISTING CHALLENGES ON TOP OF WHICH CECE ARE OPERATES SO AND YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT. CCR WILL BE IMPACTED BY NOTABLY YOU KNOW THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE NOT ONLY FOR SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM BUT CERTAINLY IN THE HEALTH CARE WORLD. A LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS AND TO SERVE PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY CLINICIANS WHO HAVE A SPECIALIZATION OF CHILDREN OR PSYCHIATRISTS WHO HAVE A SPECIALIZATION CHILDREN. WE KNOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH STANDARDIZE STATEWIDE TIMELINESS EXPECTATIONS FOR WHEN A REFERRAL. OR APPOINTMENT IS REQUESTED OF COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND WE ARE MOVING TOWARD A STATEWIDE STANDARD FOR WHAT'S CONSIDERED TIMELY AND WILL BE STARTING TO TRACK HOW COUNTIES ARE DOING IN THEIR PROVIDERS ARE DOING AND. THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES AND CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND AND HOPING THAT THEY ADDRESS THAT WHEN WE SEE THAT THERE ARE. SHORTFALLS AND HOW QUICKLY YOU'RE RESPONDING TO THE NEEDED IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. I THINK AS WELL AND I MENTIONED THIS I'M EARLIER THIS WEEK ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THE EXTENT TO WHICH. OUR PARTNERS EXPERIENCE A COUNTY BY COUNTY SIDE OF VARIATIONS. IS ALSO A CHALLENGE WERE WERE READY TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO ADDRESS THERE CERTAINLY EXPECTATIONS THAT SHOULD FALL ON EVERY SINGLE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN THAT WE. CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND BUT THE REALITIES OF RESOURCES WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AND JUST PHYSICAL LOCATION. DO SOMETIMES LEND THEMSELVES TO UNFORTUNATE. DIFFERENCES FROM ONE COUNTY TO THE NEXT AS TO HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN GET CARE AND FOR EXAMPLE WHAT CREATIVE MODELS AND THEY MIGHT HAVE VOLUNTARILY PUT IN PLACE WHERE AS OTHERS HAD NOT. FOUND. AND THEN I THINK WE'RE STILL TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE LINKAGES THAT WE HOPE OCCUR WHEN A CHILD WELFARE WORKER PROBATION STAFF SEE A MENTAL HEALTH CONCERN. MAKE A REFERRAL TO. COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT WE KNOW THAT SOME ADEQUATE ENGAGEMENT. A LACK OF CULTURAL COMPETENCY FOR THAT CHILD'S WAS THAT STIGMA ON THE PART OF THE CHILD'S CAREGIVER AND NOT REALLY WANTING. THEM TO BE IDENTIFIED AS SOMEONE WHO NEEDS EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF OF REASONS. THAT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN A BREAKDOWN SO WERE TRYING TO LEAN IN. AND RATHER THAN DEFEND AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THINGS DON'T GO WELL HOW CAN WE PREVENT THOSE THINGS FROM HAPPENING AN EAGLE HERE LATER AND PERHAPS RIGHT ABOUT NOW. ABOUT. A PROPOSAL THAT WERE CO SPONSORING WITH THE WELFARE DIRECTORS IN CHILDREN NOW TO AS WELL COMPLEMENT THIS IDEA THAT WHEN THINGS ARE IN A CRISIS MODE. WITHIN THE HOME. WE WANT SAID. IMMEDIATELY RESPOND. NOT HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLED BUT INSTEAD HAVE SUPPORTIVE INDIVIDUALS THERE TO SUPPORT THE CRISIS THAT OCCURS FOR CAREGIVERS AND AND CHILDREN AND TRY TO REDUCE THE. FILE LIKELY HAD THAT THAT PLACEMENT DISRUPTS IN THAT AGAIN WE'RE NOT FEELING UP AND THAT THE CHILD'S EXPERIENCE IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS PARLOR NEXT WILL HAVE MISSED FORT. GREAT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ANGIE SHORTS WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS. ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN THEIR FIRST PLACEMENT CHILDREN SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE MOVED TO A DIFFERENT HOME IN ORDER TO GET APPROPRIATE FUNDING AND SERVICES. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION HAVE TAKEN CRITICAL STOPS TO FIX OUR BROKEN RATE SYSTEM. CHILDREN PLACED WITH RELATIVES NOW HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO FUNDING AS NON RELATIVES. AND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW TIERED RATE SYSTEM TIED TO THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD. AND TO BE CLEAR WE FULLY SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT TIERED RATE SYSTEM IT IS EXACTLY THE WORK WE SHOULD BE DOING. THE PROBLEM IS THE PROTOCOL THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETERMINE THE CHILD'S TEAR. HAS NEVER BEEN PILOTED OR STUDIED TO DETERMINE ITS ACCURACY. AND YET AT THIS POINT IT APPEARS THERE IS NO PLAN TO DELAY STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION BEYOND MAY FIRST THE ONLY THING WE KNOW FROM A LIMITED STUDY. TO DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF YOUTH ACROSS THE DIFFERENT LEVELS IS THAT ONLY ONE PERCENT OF YOU SCORED A LEVEL FOR THE HIGHEST OF THE BASIC LEVELS. WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE RIGHT ONE PERCENT AND WE DON'T KNOW IF MORE THAN ONE PERCENT OF YOUTH SHOULD HAVE BEEN SCORED AND LEVEL FOR. WE DON'T KNOW IF THE PROTOCOL CONSISTENTLY SCORES YOUTH WITH HIGHER NEEDS IN THE HIGHER LEVELS WE DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D STEPPING DOWN FROM GROUP HOME SCORING TO HIGHER LEVELS. WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN NO ATTEMPT TO ASSESS THE ACCURACY OF THE TOOL OR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WAITED PROPERLY. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE TOOLS RELIABILITY CDSS CONDUCTED A VERY LIMITED STUDY OF RELIABILITY WERE THIRTEEN CASES WERE SCORED. BY TWO DIFFERENT WORKERS AND IT REVEALED THAT THE SAME CHILD WHO SCORED A DIFFERENT LEVEL FORTY SIX PERCENT OF THE TIME. THEY GIVE ME A LITTLE CONFIDENCE. FINALLY COUNTIES ARE BEING REQUIRED TO CHANGE THEIR SPECIALIZED CARE PLANS BUT GUIDANCE ON HOW TO CONFORM THE SPECIALIZED CARE PLANTS TO THE NEW LEVEL OF CARE SYSTEM IS NOT FINALIZED. AND NO COUNTY IS GOING TO BE READY TO IMPLEMENT BY MAY FIRST AND WE NEED ALL OF OUR COUNTIES TO BE READY TO GO WITH NEW PLANS BEFORE WE IMPLEMENT BECAUSE CHILDREN MOVE ACROSS COUNTY LINES. SO WE CAN'T BE A TIERED LIKE SOME COUNTIES CAN BE READY WHILE OTHER COUNTIES ARE NOT READY. GIVEN ALL OF THIS IN JANUARY CDSS AGREED TO DELAY STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION WHICH HAD BEEN SET TO TAKE EFFECT ON FEBRUARY FIRST. INTEL MAY AND TO STUDY BOTH THE ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY OF THE TOOL BY ROLLING IT OUT IN FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY HOMES IN MARCH AND APRIL. AFTER PHASE ARE THE PERFECT PLACE TO TEST THE TOOL BECAUSE THOSE HOMES DON'T GET SPECIALIZED CARE. HOWEVER THAT MAY ONE DEADLINE HAS PROVEN TO AGGRESSIVE DESPITE PROMISING TO ASSESS BOTH RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY THE STUDY UNDER WAY IS ONLY LOOKING AT THE RELIABILITY OF THE TOOL. THERE IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO DO THE MOST THE MORE ROBUST STUDY OF THE TOOLS VALIDITY. STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION BEFORE THE TOOL IS FULLY TESTED AND BEFORE ALL COUNTIES HAVE BEEN SPECIALIZED CARE PLANS IN PLACE WILL RESULT IN BACKLOG DELAY ERRONEOUS ASSESSMENTS PLACEMENT DISRUPTIONS AND STRESS ON OUR FAMILIES. OUR FAMILIES CARE FOR REAL CHILDREN IN REAL TIME AND NEED TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON ACCURATE AND RELIABLE RATES TO DECIDE SO. WE'RE ASKING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROTOCOL INTEL IT'S TESTED FOR VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY UNTIL APPROPRIATE CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE AND COUNTIES HAVE TIME TO TRAIN AND PROP STAFF ON THE NEW PROTOCOLS ONCE THEY'RE FINALIZED. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION OF OUR REQUEST THANK YOU MISTER SCHWARZENEGGER'S WE HAVE MISSED NOTHING. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FIRST THE TICKET. GOOD AFTERNOON. UP MY NAME IS PRETTY GOLDBERG AND I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO BEGIN MY REMARKS BY THANKING YOU THE LEGISLATURE FOR RECOGNIZING THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR INTERIM SOLUTION TO PROVIDE FUNDING AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT THROUGH ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TEN. I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW CRITICAL FUNDING SUPPORT AND SERVICES ARE FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. UNABLE SIX TWENTY SEVENTEEN I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MY DAUGHTER THE CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES HAD MY GRANDSON AND THEY WERE BRINGING HIM TO ME. A FEW WEEKS LATER HE WAS FINALLY PLACE IN MY HOME. AT THAT MOMENT I STARTED WORKING TO COMPLETE THE TRAINING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. I WAS CONCERNED THAT IF I DID NOT FINISH IN NINETY DAYS AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD I WOULD NOT BE APPROVED AND SO I DID EVERYTHING I DID. EVERYTHING I COULD POSSIBLE TO GET APPROVED A SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE. STILL IT TOOK MUCH LONGER THAN NINETY DAYS TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS THE RFA PROCESS IS COMPLICATED AND CONFUSING. I WAS ULTIMATELY APPROVED ON OCTOBER TENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WAS A FULL SIX MONTHS AFTER STARTING THE PROCESS. AND I FINALLY STARTED RECEIVING FUNDING IN LATE NOVEMBER. THAT WAS ONE MONTH THE FOR MY GRANDSON WAS RETURNED TO MY DAUGHTER. NOT RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR SEVEN MONTHS WHILE CARING FOR MY GRANDSON WAS VERY HARD ON ME. I AM BLESSED I HAVE FAMILY FRIENDS AND CO WORKERS WHO ALL STOOD UP AND HELP ME WITH MEALS GROCERIES BABY SUPPLIES AND MOST OF ALL THEIR TIME. BUT EVEN WITH THAT HELP I STRUGGLED I AM AN HOURLY EMPLOYEE SO EVERY TIME I HAD TO GO INTO WORK LATE. OR MISS A DAY TO MEET WITH ANOTHER SOCIAL WORKER WHO MOSTLY JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I HAD A CRIB. A REPRESENTATIVE FOR ANY OTHER SERVICE OR GO TO COURT I LOST TIME FROM WORK LOST TIME IS LOST MONEY. THIS MEANS LESS OF A FINANCIAL ABILITY TO CARE FOR MY GRANDSON. HAVING RECEIVED NO FUNDS I WAS AFFECTED BY AFFECTED NOT JUST ME BUT ALL OF US AND FOR WAY TOO LONG. THAT'S SO I WANNA THANK YOU FOR TAKING IMMEDIATE ACTION TO HELP THE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WHO ARE FACED WITH THIS FINANCIAL CRISIS. AS THEY TRIED TO HOLD THEIR FAMILIES TOGETHER. AB ONE TEN TOOK EFFECT RIGHT AWAY TO PROVIDE FAMILY STILL WORKING THROUGH THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS TO ACCESS FUNDING AS OF MARCH THIRTIETH. BY PROVIDING THAT FINANCIAL HELP THESE FAMILIES STILL WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU ARE HELPING PROVIDE STABILITY TO THE RELATIVES IN THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. HOWEVER WITHOUT FURTHER ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT FUNDING ENDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH. THE SUPPORT IS NOW AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES WHO ACCEPT THE EMERGENCY PLACEMENT PRIOR TO BEING APPROVED AS A RESOURCE FAMILY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND I URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE THE PROVIDE THAT FUNDING AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT BEYOND JUNE THIRTIETH SO THAT NO FAMILY. EVER HAS TO GO THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH. AND REQUIRE THAT LONG TERM SOLUTION THAT IS ADOPTED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO GAP IN FUNDING WHEN ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TEN EXPIRES AND THE NEW LONG TERM SOLUTION BEGINS. IF THESE REQUESTS BECOME REALITY FAMILIES WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON WHAT MEANS MOST TO THEM THEIR CHILDREN LIKE MY GRANDSON. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU ALL TODAY AND SHARE MY STORY. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU CONTINUE FUNDING AT THE TIME PLACE. THANK YOU MONTH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS SUSANNAH NOTHIN AYE WITH CHILDREN NOW I'M HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM. AND THAT IS AS HE BEACH DAC WTA AND CHILDREN NOW. CCR ENVISIONED THAT ALL FOSTER YOUTH AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MEDIA AND APPROPRIATE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES REGARDLESS OF PLACEMENT SETTING. UNFORTUNATELY CCR HAS NOT YET CREATED A STRUCTURE TO MEET THE URGENT NEEDS OF YOUTH AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AT THE TIME THAT AN EMOTIONAL CRISIS ARISES. THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND MEDIA RESPONSE FOR CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES PROVIDED BY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED TO PROVIDE TRAUMA BASED SUPPORT AND CRISIS INTERVENTION. THE CENTRAL GATEWAY TO THE LOCAL TWENTY FOUR SEVEN RESPONSE WOULD BE A STATE LEVEL HOTLINE TO RESPOND TO CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE AND A WARM HAND OFF TO COUNTY BASED MOBILE RESPONSE TEAMS. TO PROVIDE IN PERSON DE ESCALATION AND SUPPORT THE YOUTH AND CAREGIVER. ONCE THE RESPONSES MADE THIS TEAM WOULD THEN LINK THE YOUTH AND FAMILY TO THE EXISTING CONTINUUM OF LOCAL SERVICES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN A YOUNG PERSON ENTERS THE HOME OF A CARE GIVER IT'S VERY CHALLENGING FOR THEM BOTH TO BUILD A NEW RELATIONSHIP. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH HAVING TO ADJUST TO A NEW HOME TO NEW CAREGIVER TO HEAL FROM THEIR GRIEF AND LOSS OF BEING REMOVED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. AND TO BEGIN TO HEAL FROM THE TRAUMA OF THAT THE USE AND NEGLECT THAT THEY WENT THROUGH. AT THE SAME TIME CAREGIVERS HAVE OPENED THEIR HOMES AND THEIR HEARTS TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND DESPERATELY WANT TO DO RIGHT BY THEM OFTEN FEEL ALONE AS THEY TRY TO DEVELOP A LEASH RELATIONSHIP AND BUILD TRUST. NAVIGATING TRAUMA DUES TRIGGERS. AND THEY OFTEN FEEL ALONE IS THEY DO THESE THINGS. AND TALKING WITH YOU THINK CAREGIVERS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF BUILDING THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP THEY OFTEN ASK IF THERE'S SOMEONE THEY CAN CALL. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT OR IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRICKY SITUATION TO GET SUPPORT. A TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE AND COORDINATED MOBILE RESPONSE WILL PROVIDE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH THE PLACE TO TURN AND MOMENTS OF UNCERTAINTY HELP IMPROVE PLACEMENT STABILITY REDUCE THE IMPORT AN APPROPRIATE USE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MANAGE THE SITUATIONS. I CONNECT CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND CAREGIVERS TO BENEFICIAL SERVICES THAT WILL ALLOW FOSTER CHILDREN TO HEAL AND THRIVE IN FAMILY HOMES INSTEAD OF INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU MA'AM. NEXT WE WILL HILL HERE FROM SHARON THE WAY THAT THAT'S OUR HERNANDEZ AND LUCY SALCEDO. CARTER WHEN YOU READY SHARON. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SHARON TO WAIT AND I'M A SUPERVISOR CHILDREN SOCIAL WORKER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES IN LA COUNTY. I WORK IN THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL DIVISION I AM ALSO A AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD FOR. SEVEN TWO ONE THAT'S THE UNION AND LA COUNTY. I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN BEHALF OF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS OUR CLIENTS IN REGARDS TO CONTINUING CARE REFORM AND THE IMPACT THAT THE BUDGET HAS ON OUR CLIENTS. I WORKED IN A MULTITUDE OF CAPACITIES IN DCFS. DUST MITES ARE CHAO PROTECTIVE AGENCY ONE OF THOSE CAPACITIES ARE ROLES WAS AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE WORKER WHICH IDEA FOR FOUR YEARS WHICH I WAS ACTUALLY IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT. AND REMOVING CHILDREN FROM THEIR HOMES. MOST OF THE TIMES WHEN I MEET PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE CHILD WELFARE HUMAN SERVICES WORLD. AND I TELL THEM THAT I'M A SOCIAL WORKER THEY EITHER. AT SHOT LIGHT WOW THAT'S WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO FOR A LIVING. OR SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY GET ANGRY WITH ME AND THEY STEP AWAY BECAUSE I'M AS YOU KNOW LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT CHAO PROTECTION AGENCIES DON'T HAVE THE BEST REPUTATION. AND THERE'S A LOT OF SPEAKING ABOUT BEING A SOCIAL WORKER. BUT MOST OF MY FAMILIES AND FRIENDS WOULD USUALLY BE CUT BE CONCERNED AN AX ME ISN'T IT A DANGEROUS ROLE IN A DANGEROUS JOB. FOR ME IT WAS IN A DANGEROUS JOB JUST BECAUSE I LOVE THE KEY IT SO MUCH AND I REALLY PUT A LOT OF LOVING CARE TO WHAT I DO. BUT I DO REMEMBER A STORY OF A CHILD NAMED LITTLE TEA AT WHICH IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS SITUATIONS I HAD EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE. IT WAS A REFERRAL FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE REFERRAL. IN WHICH A NEIGHBORHOOD JUST CAUGHT IN A NON AS WE HAVE SAID THAT THE MOTHER WAS BEING BE. ANY DOES A ONE SENTENCE ON THE REFERRAL THE MOTHER IS BEING BEAT AND I HAD TO ADDRESS. SO WHEN I RESPONDED TO THE AT HOME I INTERVIEWED LITTLE T. WHO WAS NINE YEARS SO. AND HE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT MY FATHER GETS OUT OF JAIL HE'S GOING TO BEAT UP MY MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND AND I SAY WELL WHY WOULD HE DO THAT. ANY SAID BECAUSE MY MOTHER IS BEING BEAT EVERY NIGHT. AND HE SAID ANDTHERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M TOO LITTLE. AND SO I SPOKE TO THE MOM AND I SPOKE TO THE BOYFRIEND AND IN THAT ENVIRONMENT I WAS TERRIFIED. I CAN'T REALLY DESCRIBE JUST THE BOYFRIENDS AGGRESSION TOWARDS THE MOM AND THE BEHAVIOR AND I WAS THERE BY MYSELF I DIDN'T HAVE THE POLICE. AND SO. EVEN EVEN THOUGH APARTMENT NEIGHBORS WERE RUNNING THROUGH ME SAYING PLEASE HELP THIS LITTLE BOY BECAUSE HE SOMETIMES KNOCKS ON OUR DOOR FOR FOOD. ALLMAN HE SOMETIMES KNOCKS ON OUR DOOR SAYING CAN YOU SPEND THE NIGHT BECAUSE HIS MOM IS BEING ABUSED. I'M HIS MAMA SOMETIMES PASSED OUT AN APARTMENT FROM BEING KNOCKED OUT BY THE BOYFRIEND. AND SO BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE EXIGENCY TO REMOVE THAT SHOUT IN THAT SITUATION BECAUSE DANGER WAS NOT HAPPEN AT THAT MOMENT EVEN THOUGH I FELT A FREE. I'M I ACTUALLY HAD TO GET A WARRANT REMOVAL ORDER TO COME BACK WITH THE POLICE. IT'S REMOVED THIS CHILD. I ACTUALLY HAD A INTER WITH ME ALSO SO THAT IT CAN BE A LEARNING EXPERIENCE WITH HER AND I HAVE ONE LAW WHOM I HAD A POLICE OFFICER WITH ME. THE BOYFRIEND JUMPED OUT OF A TWO STORY WINDOW WHEN HE'S HEARD THE POLICE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR. AND WHEN WE WALKED INTO THE APARTMENT THE MOM WAS ALREADY PACKING THE CHILD'S BANKS BECAUSE THE NEIGHBORHOOD CAUGHT TOLD HER THAT WE WERE COMING TO TAKE HER SON. WHEN I SPOKE THE WORDS THAT I AM REMOVING YOU FROM YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR GOING TO BE PLACED IN A FOSTER HOME. THIS CHILD SCREAMS SO LOUD NO SOUND CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH. I WILL NEVER FORGET IT HIS HEART BROKE. INTO A MILLION PIECES. WHEN I LOOK BACK AT MY INTERN SHE WAS IN TEARS. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE POLICE OFFICER THAT WAS WITH ME ACTUALLY STEPPED OUT OF THE HOME BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO CRYING. THIS IS THE POLICE OFFICER. I COULD NOT CRY AND I TOLD MYSELF NOT TO CRY. BECAUSE AT THAT TIME I HAVE TO PROVIDE THE CHILD WITH THE SUPPORT THAT HE NEEDED IN THE COMPASSIONATE HE NEEDED I COULDN'T BREAK DOWN MYSELF. THE MOTHER HAD NO AFFECT. HE GAVE ME HIS CLOTHES SHE DID NOT HURT HIM SHE DID NOT KISS HIM. SHE DID NOT TAKE THE FOSTER PARENTS PHONE NUMBER TO CALL HIM. AFTER I REMOVED HIM SHE NEVER SHOWED UP TO COURT. SHE DID SHOW UP TO OUR OFFICE AND AFTER WE HAD LEFT THE BOYFRIEND CAME BACK AND SPLITTERS GOLD OPEN. SO SHE HAS STITCHES ALL IN HER SCALP. THEY SHOUT AT THE GO TO COURT FOR SIX MONTHS. AND EVERYTIME HE WENT TO COURT HIS MOTHER WASN'T THERE. TO SAY THE LEAST. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME EVERY DAY IN MY AGENCY. AND IS THE IMPACT LAST MONTH JUST THE MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. EIGHT HUNDRED CHILDREN WERE DETAINED FROM THEIR PARENTS CUSTODY IN LA COUNTY ALONE. EIGHT HUNDRED. GO THROUGH WITH THE SHOT WENT THROUGH. SO I SAY THAT AND I GIVE S. THE WORRY JUST BECAUSE THESE KIDS HAVE BEEN SO TRAUMATIZED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THEY NEED SO MUCH CARE THEY NEED SO MUCH SUPPORT. THERAPY. ARMED MENTORS CEO OF TEAS IT TAKES SO MUCH TO GET THEM IN A PLACE TO WEAR THEIR STABLE I FOR SOME OF THEM LIKE THE SHOUT UNFORTUNATELY HE ENDED UP IN THE PROBATION SYSTEM. AND THEN ENDED UP IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. BECAUSE HE JUST COULD NOT YOU KNOW. RECOVER FROM THE TRAUMA THAT HE HAD EXPERIENCE AND ABANDONMENT. AND I ALWAYS THINK BACK TO HIS SCREEN. SCREEN WASN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT ME TAKING HIM. HIS SCREAM WAS ABOUT. EVERYTHING THE HE HAD BEEN THROUGH HIS LIFE THEY LEAD UP TO ME TAKING HIM. HE HAD HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF MOTHER BEING ABUSED ALL THAT TIME AND THIS WAS LIKE THE FINAL BLOW NOW YOU'RE BEING REMOVED AND TAKEN TO A PLACE. WHERE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING? NOT ONLY DO WE REMOVE A LARGE QUANTITY OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT NOW IN MY COUNTY THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED KEY IT'S WITHOUT PLACEMENT AS OF APRIL NINTH THERE IN LIMBO. THEY ARE EITHER A WALL IN SHELTER CARE OR IN A ON APPROVED RELATIVE'S HOME. WHERE THE RELATIVE WAS ACTUALLY DID NOT BY OUR IF FATE BUT THERE'S NO WHERE ELSE THE PLACE THEM SO THEY'D BEEN LEFT THERE? WHAT I'M ASKING TODAY AS A SOCIAL WORKER THE PERSON WHO CONNECTS THE CHAO TO ALL THAT THE SERVICES THE PERSON TO SCHEDULES THIS SEA OF TI'S CONNECT THEM THE REGIONAL CENTER? CONNECT THEM TO THERAPY CONNECT THEM TO THEIR MENTOR SHOW UP TO COURT WHEN THE PARENT DOESN'T SHOW UP TO COURT. WE'RE ASKING DAY. YOU GUYS INVEST BEFORE FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT CCR IF YOU WANT CHILDREN TO HAVE A SAFE HOME WITH THE SUPPORT OF FAMILY. AND UNDERSTAND IT TAKES RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THAT. THAT RESOURCE INCLUDES MORE SOCIAL WORKERS THAT RESOURCE INCLUDING MORE SERVICES FOR YOUTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM FEAR POWERFUL. NEXT WE HAVE MINISTER HERNANDEZ. THINK KILL. AS A HIT SIT HERE AND LISTEN. I GET A LITTLE. FLUSTERED I ALSO GREW UP IN FOSTER CARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE STORIES. THEY JUST SHARED IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT MY MEMBERS HAVE EXPERIENCED. IN MY CURRENT ROLE. I WORK WITH KERN WARMER PASTA IT'S A. STEVE. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO BE ON. I THINK THE. HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZING AND. IN THE POLICY WORLD. I THINK IT. I'M GOING. OKAY. I'D LIKE TO HAVE COLLECT MY THOUGHTS THANK YOU. OKAY I'M MY NAME IS LUCY SALZEDO CARTER I'M WITH THE YOUTH LAW CENTER. I'M WE ADVOCATE TO TRANSFORM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS THAT ALL CHILDREN CAN THRIVE. AND I DO WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO FOR A MINUTE. TO SOME OF THE WHAT THE RESEARCHERS SAY. ON BECAUSE I DO THINK WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH IT'S GOOD TO REMEMBER WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. AND I'D LIKE TO JUST DO A COUPLE OF SHORT QUOTES FROM THE CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON GROUP CARE FOR CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS WHICH CAME OUT OF THE AMERICAN ORTHO PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. I'M IN THE FIRST QUOTE IS. GROUP SETTINGS SHOULD NOT BE USED AS LIVING ARRANGEMENTS. BECAUSE OF THEIRINHERENTLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN. REGARDLESS OF AGE. I'M AND THE SECOND ONE IS HEALTHY ATTACHMENTS WITH THE PARENT FIGURE. ARE NECESSARY FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES AND HELP TO REDUCE PROBLEM BEHAVIORS AND INTERPERSONAL DIFFICULTIES. AND THE THIRD ONE IS GROUP CARE SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT IN CHILDREN. ONLY WHEN CLINICALLY NECESSARY. AND THE GOAL SHOULD BE. RETURN TO FAMILIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO I I JUST WANTED TO GROUND US IN THAT RESEARCH BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO WHAT CCR IS ALL ABOUT. I AM AND THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT I'M. CCR IS. IS A MAJOR REFORM AND AND WE'VE BEEN UNDERTAKING AT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. EXISTING PRACTICE HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. IT'S HUGE CULTURE CHANGE AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AND YET. WE KNOW. THAT WE CAN GO BACK THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF. OF THE SYSTEM THE WAY IT WAS ARE JUST TOO GREAT. I AM AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO TO POINT OUT THAT. AMONG THE HARMS OF GROUP CARE. AND ARE THE UNNECESSARY CALLS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT LEAD TO DRAMATIC CONTACT WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT CRIMINALIZE ABUSE AND NEGLECT OF CHILDREN. SO. NOW THAT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF CCR WE CAN SEE THAT IT'S GOING TO COST MORE. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE TIME THAN WE ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. BUT IT'S WORTH IT TO GET IT RIGHT. BECAUSE THE ISSUES RELATED TO SEE SEE ARE SO COMPLEX BECAUSE WE FACE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES SOON. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNS AS WE FORGE AHEAD. WE DO NEED TO PUT SOME PROTECTIONS IN PLACE IN THE SHORT TERM. PROTECTIONS THAT MAYBE INTERIM. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND AND BUILD SOLID PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR A MINUTE. AND I'M TALKING ABOUT PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE CONVERSION TO STR TEEPEES. WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE AT THE HEART OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. THROUGH CCR. THEY'RE THE BASIS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. AS WE GO THROUGH THE CONVERSION PROCESS AND THEY ARE ALSO GOING TO GROUND THE LEVEL OF CARE SYSTEM THAT IS IN DEVELOPMENT. I'M SO THAT WE CAN BE SURE THAT. CHILDREN'S NEEDS ARE MET. I AM. SO WHATEVER IS IMPLEMENTED NOW AS AN INTERIM. MEASURE. WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE REVISITED TO ENSURE THAT IT IS ALIGNED WITH THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES WHEN THEY ARE DEVELOPED WE REALLY FEEL LIKE. PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN SOME WAYS SHOULD BE DONE FIRST BECAUSE THEY THEY SET THE PRECEDENT AND REALLY. OTHER CLARIFY WHAT THE GOALS ARE FOR THE WHOLE REST OF THE WORK BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT'S WORKING. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT. I'M WHATEVER'S PUT IN PLACE AN INTERIM FASHION IS REVISITED. WHEN THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE IN PLACE. AND I DO WANNA JUST REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE IS DYSFUNCTIONAL AND IT'S HARMFUL TO CHILDREN. IT'S IT'S NOT WORKING. WE HAVE CHILDREN WHO NEED SERVICES AND AREN'T GETTING THEM. WE HAVE CHILDREN BEING COMMODIFIED IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO GET A CERTAIN RATE. AND IT'S NOT FOCUSED ON QUALITY OF CARE. SO AS WE LOOK FORWARD ON. I REALLY HOPE THAT THE FOCUS STAYS ON QUALITY OF CARE AND THAT WE DON'T PATHOLOGY EYES CHILDREN IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE RATE STRUCTURE. AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS DISRUPTIVE. TWO USER. A CURRENT TERM OF IT IS BIG CULTURE CHANGE AND CULTURE CHANGE IS HARD. I'M BUT WE HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING A STRUCTURE THAT STRENGTH BASED AND THAT WILL HELP YOUNG PEOPLE THRIVE. SO I'M. WE PROPOSE THAT CERTAIN INTERIM STRUCTURES LIKE LEVEL OF CARE BE PUT IN PLACE NOW AND STOP GAP MEASURES. BUT SEE THEM AS TWO TO THREE YOUR PILOTS THAT ARE REVISITED WHEN THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES A FINALIZED SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE COMMIT TO REVISITING THE STOP GAP MEASURES. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR LONG TERM ALIGNMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND HAPPENS. SO THAT THIS CCR REALLY RESULTS AND TRUE POSITIVE CHANGE AND WE GET THE GREAT OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN THAT THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU. S. GARDENER. REMEMBER IF YOU'RE READY. EIGHT YOU. AND SO IN THAT MOMENT ON I WROTE DOWN MY LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS NAMES. I WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. AND. THE HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY IN LOG PASSION FOR THESE TOPICS. THEY ARE CHRIS HERNANDEZ FROM SHASTA KILLING JONES. KILLER BELIEVE RICARDO GENESIS GINA KAYLA KATERINA ENCLOSURE. AS I MENTIONED OTHER YOUNGER ENERGETIC THE PASSIONATE AND pTHEIR VOICES CAN CHANGE THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN OF MULTIPLE CCR CONVERSATIONS I'VE FOR MULTIPLE YEARS NOW. ARIS WE ENGAGE IN THE TOPICS ON THE STATEWIDE LEVEL ON THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE MEMBERS OF MY MEMBERS CONTINUOUSLY ASK ME IN ENGAGE. HOWARD THESE SYSTEM CHANGES CHANGING THE DATA DAILY LIVES OF THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN CARE. THIS MANY TIMES OUR CONVERSATION FLOWS THE WHAT IS THE DATA DAY IMPACT FOR MY BROTHER AND SISTERS. I'M OUT ALSO FORMER MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA CONNECTION I GREW UP IN FOSTER CARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN WHEN I AM MANSA PETERED. WHEN I EMANCIPATED I'D VERY LITTLE SUPPORT OR FAMILY IN MY CORNER. AND SEE WAY SEE HELPED ME FIND MY VOICE AND MORE THAN ANYTHING A HELP TO FIND MY COMMUNITY. SOMETHING THAT I HAVE BEEN HEARING RECENTLY AND THIS CONVERSATION. AND WITHIN THE SEATS ARE REFORM IS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A MAJOR CULTURE SHIFT. WE'RE ALSO HEARING SOME OF THE STRUGGLES AND THE BARRIERS THAT WORK THE SCENE AND TO WE URGE FOLKS TO HAVE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS AND KEEP. PERSEVERING. OVER A WE'D LIKE TO CHALLENGE THIS DOMINANT NARRATIVE THAT THERE ARE SOME USE THAT ARE TOO HARD TO PLACE. MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN AND ENGAGED MY MEMBERS DIRECTLY. MY MEMBERS ARE SMART THEY'RE PASSIONATE AND AND THEY ALL HAVE POTENTIAL. AND AND THEY HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED ABUSE OR NEGLECT. THIS YEAR WE'RE WORKING ON OUR CAMPAIGN FOSTER STABILITY WHICH WILL CREATE A YOUTH CENTER PROCESS FOR STABILITY IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THIS INCLUDE STABILITY EMPLACEMENT STABILITY AND WELLNESS STABILITY IN RELATIONSHIPS IN EDUCATION. AND STABILITY IN ALL ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES. AS THEY HAVE GROWN IN. EXPERIENCE A REFLECTED THEIR TIME IN CARE. STABILITY IS THEIR NUMBER ONE HOUSE. AS WE. REVIEW THE PROGRESS IN THE DIRECTION OF CCR. AND WE CONSIDER VARIOUS BUDGET PROPOSALS IN THE MULTITUDE OF EFFORTS. WE APPROACH EACH CONVERSATION WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WILL THIS EFFORT TRANSFORM THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND WILL IT FOSTER STABILITY AND AUTHOR ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIVES. IN REGARDS THE VISION AND THE PROMISE OF CCR WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE THAT YES THIS WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE WE BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN YOU SHOULD BE RAISED IN A LOVING COMMITTED HOMES AND NOT IN CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS. SPECIFICALLY THERE A FEW PIECES THAT MY MEMBERS ARE SPECIALLY I'M EXCITED ABOUT AND THE HAVE THE MOST POTENTIAL THIS INCLUDES TOM FAMILY TEAMS THE YOUTH SATISFACTION SURVEY AND THEN ONGOING. TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR RESOURCE PARENTS THESE THREE COMBINED. WILL BE A SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THEMSELVES. IN REGARDS TO THE STR TP CONVERSATION OUR MEMBERS FEEL STRONGLY THAT THEY SHOULD BE ADDRESS ON BOTH FRONTS SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE AS THEY TRANSITION OUT OF GROUP HOMES. BUT ALSO FOCUSING IN ON LIMIT IN THE ENTRY INTO. AND OR FEELING UP INTO GROUP HOMES TRAUMA INFORMED TO PRACTICE AND COMMON FORMED SYSTEMS ARE JUST FOR US FOLKS ASK WHAT HAS HAPPENED. NOT WHAT DID YOU DO YOU THINK US CHARITY PIECE. AND GROUP HOMES INCURRING GROUP HOMES ARE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE PLACEMENT CHANGES ON AVERAGE THEY'VE EXPERIENCED BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE PLEASE MAKE CHANGES BEFORE THEY GET TO A GROUP HOME. WE WANT TO CHALLENGE WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES AND WORK THROUGH THEM AS PARTNERS AND WE WANT TO CHALLENGE THE DOMINANT NARRATIVE. THAT NO YOUNG PERSON IS TOO HARD TO PLEASE AND I EACH YOUNG PERSON HAS POTENTIAL. IN REGARDS TO. THE TRADUCTOR YEAR OF THE A LEVEL OF CARE ASSESSMENT. WE ASK THAT THERE IS ALSO A SIXTY DAY DELAY. ON THE IMPLEMENTATION SOMETHING WE'D LIKE TO BE HAVE CONSIDERED IS THAT THIS LOC TOOL BE COMBINED IN A CONVERSATION WITH HOW THE CAN CAN'T ASSESSMENT TOOL AND THE SCR ALSO ROLLED OUT. IT OCCURS TO US THAT I A YOUTH CENTERED AND FAMILY CENTERED SYSTEM. IS NOW ASKING FOR THREE SEPARATE EVALUATIONS AND THREE SEPARATE ASSESSMENTS WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL THREE OF THEM ARE COORDINATED AND ARE NOT COORDINATED. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO ASK THE SYSTEM THAT IT CONTINUES TO BE YOUTH CENTERED AND FAMILY CENTERED BEFORE CONSIDERING ANY OTHER. EFFORTS THINK YOU. THANK YOU MS HERNANDEZ FOR YOUR COURAGE IN EFFICACY. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALEJO SO WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ELLIOT AND DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO BONDS TO. BURN ON THE PANEL BEFORE WE TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. BUT THEN WILL FOLLOW THAT WITH PUBLIC COME. MINORITIES. I JUST BRAINSTORMED FINANCE SO I THINK WE'LL START OFF WITH IS SKINNER JUST ADDRESSING THE PROPOSALS WERE PUT ASIDE. SO THEY ARE FEE PROPOSAL ON. LOOKING FOR A LONG TERM SOLUTION SOMETHING THAT WOULD FOLLOW ALONG WITH ON WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE WORKED WITH AN AB ONE TEN. W ARE. LOOKING INTO YOU ARE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS INDIA AND THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES ON A A DEVELOPING A LONG TERM SOLUTION. TO ADDRESS THAT IMMEDIATE FUNDING UPON PLACEMENT AS WELL AS LOOKING INTO THE CURRENT BACKLOG. WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH THE RESOURCE SIMPLY A PROVOCATIONS SADDAM IN REGARDS WITH THE. OTHER THAN THE REMAINING PROPOSALS ARE INCLUDE AND. AT THIS TIME. IF FINANCE THREE OPPOSED ANY ACTION TAKEN ON ON THIS PROPOSALS BECAUSE WHERE I AM WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO RIDE JUST TO LOOK INTO THIRD EVALUATING A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED TODAY ON TO THE EXTENT THAT AFTER THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE CONTINUING OUR GO THROUGH. AND. EVALUATIONS ARE DETERMINED SOMETHING MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE MAIN REVISION TO PROVIDE TO LEGISLATURE. BUT WE DO WANT ITS ARE THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATIONS WE'VE BEEN HEARING THIS CONCERNS. AND TIME WILL CONTINUE TO GO ON WITH THOSE TO THE EXTENT. THAT ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS. INTO BEING A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WERE. MORE THAN WILLING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MOVING FORWARD ON THOSE AS WELL. THANK YOU SIR. BOB BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA OUT. WE DID CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR CCR PROPOSAL AND SHARED AND MANY OF THE FINDINGS THAT WERE PRESENT IN THE AGENDA THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. HERE WE PROVIDE A STATUS UPDATE THAT'S LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MANY OF THAT MUCH OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS ALSO. THAT OCCURRED BEFORE ME I AM I AM I JUST FOCUS THEN ON A FEW OF THE SORT OF BUDGETARY ASPECTS AND SO FORTH AND SO. UP IN TERMS OF HOW HOW HOW THINGS ARE GOING AND WE. WE PROVIDE A STATUS UPDATE IN WHICH WE FOCUS ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSES AND YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL OF GUIDANCE GET. COMING OUT OF DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES COLLABORATION WITH THE BEHAVIORAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND DH YES AND SO FORTH AND SO WE DO WANNA YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE PROGRESS THAT'S MADE WHILE ALSO NOTING THE CHALLENGES AROUND RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL. OF CONCERNS AROUND THE LEVEL OF CARE ASSESSMENT AND SO FORTH WE DO NOTE SORT OF. THE SIR THE SLOWER THAN ANTICIPATED CASELOAD MOVEMENT OUT OF GROUP HOMES AND INTO UP BOTH THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS INTO LOWER LEVEL PLACEMENTS. AND THE IMPACT THAT THIS HAS HAD ON. SORT OF MULTI YEAR PROJECTION OF WHAT THE COSTS OF CC ARE GOING TO BE A GOING FORWARD SO THERE ARE HIGHER COSTS UP PROJECTED IN BOTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. OVER PREVIOUS PROJECTIONS UP LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THE SLOWER CASELOAD MOVEMENT. AND ULTIMATELY WE FIND THAT THAT UPWARD REVISION DE ISRAELI REASON FORD TO. YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE AB ONE TEN AND THE SUCCESS THAT THAT AD SPACE POTENTIALLY BRILLIANT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUT THAT TO KNOW THAT THAT WAS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION. AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT COMES AROUND THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISE THEIR. AND THEN. JUST ALSO A WRECK AND YET AND SO FINALLY THEN JUST STOP RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE CLOSELY MONITOR HOW THE RESOURCE FAMILY PROVOKE PROCESS IS SPEEDING UP GIVEN. NEW IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND SO FORTH. AND WHETHER ANY BUDGETARY OR OR POLICY FIXES ARE IN FACT NECESSARY SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OF THANK YOU SIR. DOCTOR LIKE PORN. THE PROBLEM THAT YOU PUT PRIVATE NOBODY CAN GET YOUR NOW THAT'S AT THAT POINT THANK YOU THANK YOU A DOCTOR ON THE. ARM. OBVIOUSLY A VARIETY OF ISSUES WOULD COME UP AND FROM ALL FROM PEOPLE MY OF UTMOST. THE DEEP WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH. AUTUMN. A COUPLE POINTS ARM. THE ASPECT OF SORT OF THE AVAILABILITY FOR EXAMPLE ALL OF THE STR TP. CHAIN WELL WE CURRENTLY HAVE HOME TWENTY SEVEN. PROVIDERS APPROVED THAT'S WITH MULTIPLE LOCATIONS BUT THERE ANOTHER SIXTY IN THE QUEUE. THAT WERE WORKING FOR NOW. FIRST SOME OF THOSE ARE PROBABLY NOT AS BIG AS SOME OF THOSE READY PROVIDE. APPROVED BUT THE OTHER THING WHICH I THINK IT SORT OF POINTS TO A LITTLE BIT THIS IS A. CRITICS OFTEN BUT LET'S SAY IT. IS THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF DENIAL. ARM LET'S SEE IF THIS IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN SO WE HAVE SOME. PROVIDERS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HANGING BACK. OF WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS EMPHASIZING VERY VERY CLEARLY TO THE PROVIDERS MEANT TO ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS. THAT NO WE'RE THIS IS MOVING AHEAD AND THAT HOME. IT'S TIME TO. IF THE APPLICATIONS AND FINALIZED ETCETERA ALONG THE IT WOULD LIKEWISE SORT OF YOU KNOW PART COLLEAGUES A DHC HACER NOW OUT IN THE FIELD WORKING WITH COUNTIES AROUND. MEDICAL CERTIFICATIONS AND BASICALLY SAYING VERY CLEARLY THE COUNTIES YOU HAVE TO TELL US EITHER YOU. LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ARE GOING TO DO CERTIFICATION OR WE WILL DEFAULT AND GO IT BECAUSE THAT'S. THE RULES PER PROVIDE FOR SO THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE NOW INTENSIFYING AND AS I WOULD EXPECT. HOME. THE. I I KEEP RUNNING TALLY GOING OUT WE GOT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS BEFORE. FOR A DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST SO IT'S SORT OF YOU KNOW WE'RE GETTING UP TO THE MIDDLE OF THE. WHOSE FIRST SEMESTER MAYBE HALFWAY INTO THE SECOND AND WHERE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THOSE PUPILS WERE HAVING A TOUGHER TIME AND GIVE THE MORE ATTENTION AND WE DON'T GIVE UP ON ANYBODY. ARM BUT WE SORT OF START PULLING PEOPLE ACROSS BOTH WE ALSO DON'T LOWER THE STANDARDS ON THE STANDARDS HAVE TO STUDY. WHAT IT IS WE WOULD SET UP WE'VE WE'VE SORT COLLECTIVELY DREAMED ABOUT? ON THE THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESSES. ALEJO'S NOTED. HOME DEFINITELY SORT OF BECAME A BIT OF A CHOKE POINT THE SYSTEM. ARM. AND AND IT WAS IRONIC IN IT'S OWN WAY BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAS THE PEACE THAT WE HAD DONE A ONE YEAR PILOT ON. AND WORTH. ALL SET TO GO IT WAS GOOD EVERYBODY WAS GUT AND THEN IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS JUST DIFFICULT IN THE TRANSITION. TO COUNTIES THAT HADN'T YET ENTERED INTO IT AND PREPARE. SO WE'VE STUMPED YOU KNOW WE STREAMLINED THE PROCESS IS GOTTEN OUT HOME. MOVING I THINK QUITE A LOT FASTER COUNTIES REPORTING THAT IT IS GOING A LOT FASTER BUT IN ADDITION THANK YOU AB ONE TEN HAS DEFINITELY SORT OF AVERTED WHAT WAS A. LOOMING CRISIS AUTUMN AND IS AS FINANCES INDICATED WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM FOR WHAT WILL BE THE GO PAST JUNE THIRTIETH. OWN SOLUTION FOR PAYMENT OF PLACEMENT. WON'T BE THE OTHER AREAS WHICH THERE'S BEEN SORT OF REFERENCE TO HIS IS THE LEVEL OF CARE. RATES AND THE THE THE INSTRUMENTS THE PARTICLES. ARE AYE AYE AYE CIRCLE PLANS AND THEN MAYBE HAVE SERVER OR GREGSON ELABORATE ANYTHING AMISS. DE. THERE ISN'T A TOOL OUT THERE THAT WE CAN GO AND SHOP FOR AND SAY LET'S DO A REAL NEEDS BASED. INSTRUMENT FOR FOSTER USE ARMED. MEN TO THE STATES THAT HAVE. RATES ANYWHERE COMPARABLE TO OURS ALL DO WHAT WE ARE LEAVING WHICH IS AN AGE BASED RIGHT TO GET ONE RIGHT. WHEN YOU'RE THIS AGING ANOTHER RATE OF THAT IT IS NOT CONNECTED TO. WHAT THE INDIVIDUALS NEEDS ARE? COUNTIES HAVE TO HAVE. THEY IN A SENSE COMPENSATE FOR THE OUT OR MITIGATE THAT. WELL HOME DEVELOPMENTS OF SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENTS THE STI SUPER FURTIVE. THAT VARY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY ARM MOST COUNTIES HAVE THEM BUT NOTABLE. ARM AND THE ATTORNEYS ARE TO HAVE THE OPTION OF DO THEY PAY. THEIR RATE WHEN THEY PLACE IN ANOTHER COUNTY OR DO THEY PAY THE OTHER COUNTIES RIGHT ON MINUTES. PRETTY COOL. HERE'S THE POINTS I'D LIKE YOU TO TOOK. BE CLEAR ON ABOUT THE LEVEL OF CARE. TIERED RATES. THE LOWEST RATE THE LEVEL OF CARE ONE RATE IS HIGHER. THEN THE RATES. THAT EXISTED PREVIOUSLY. SO NO ONE GETS A REDUCED RATE. FROM THE FOSTER CARE PAYMENT RIGHT. THE QUESTION BECOMES IS THERE A POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGE THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT NOT GET A SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENTS BECAUSE OF THE. LEVEL OF CARE INSTRUMENT ON SOLUTION WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES TO DO IS TO SAY. ARM. IF YOU'RE SPECIALIZED CARE AND COMMIT RATE IS LOWER THAN THE TEARS IN THE LEVEL OF CARE RATE. YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA ADVANTAGE THE FAMILY BY USING THE LEVEL OF CARE. THAT. THEY WILL PROBABLY BENEFIT IF YOUR ASCII RATES ARE HIGHER. THEN THE OPTION IS ALL STAY WITH THE SCR UNTIL YOU'VE SUBMITTED YOUR REPLIES PLAN WITH US IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE STATEWIDE AND IT NEVER. REALISTICALLY WAS GOING TO BE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES DON'T DO. THINGS AT THE SAME TIME. MOM AND WE YOU CAN'T WAIT TILL THE FIFTY EIGHTH BECAUSE YOU NEVER START. AUTUMN SO THAT IS I THINK HA HA IT. FERNANDES IS QUESTION ABOUT ARM. WHO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF CARE RATE MCCANN'S INSTRUMENT? WE VERY DELIBERATELY DON'T WANT THEM CONFUSED. THE LEVEL OF CARE IS DETERMINING A PAYMENT. TO THE CARE GIVER. FOR WHAT ISN'T. UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE NEEDS THE CARE GIVERS GOING TO HAVE IN PROVIDING FOR THE START. IT'S NOT COMPENSATION TO THE CAREGIVER. IT'S MEETING THE. SUPERB KERINCI PROVISION COST. THE KARENS INSTRUMENT IS DETERMINED OF SERVICE NEEDS FOR THE CHILD. OR WHAT WILL BE TRIGGERED THROUGH EITHER MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS OR. OTHER SYSTEMS AND. ONE WOULD NEVER WANT TO CONFUSE THE FUNCTIONING SO THAT I COULD THINK. THIS WAS LOOSE WHAT LUCY WAS ALLUDING TO THE COMMODIFICATION. OF A CHILD'S ASSESSMENT WE NEVER WANT TO PUT A DOLLAR VALUE ON DETERMINING WHETHER THERE ARE A CHILD HAS EMOTIONAL ISSUES ARE NEEDS OR OR WHATEVER THAT'S. NOT WOULD TOTALLY CONFUSE THE FUNCTION AND BE I THINK VERY UNFAIR TO THE CHILDREN. ARM. SORT OF MORE BROADLY TO THE MIDDLE. REFLOATING ANXIETY ABOUT TIME IS SHORT AND CHALLENGES A GREAT YES WE ARE FULLY AWARE OF IT AND WALLEM. THE FOR THE FIRST ELEMENT RIGHT NOW IS REALLY WORKING AT A GRANULAR FASHION COUNTY BY COUNTY. PALM. SERVICE ERRORS GROUP ARE DOING SORT OF REGULAR CALLS WITH ALL THE COUNTY SAYING. HOW MANY BEDS DO YOU NEED WHERE ARE YOU WHAT PROCESS IS UNDERWAY? AND FINALLY FOR THE ISSUE OF RECRUITING OF THE NON SD RTP BUT STAY HOME BASED FAMILY BUT CARE. BASED THE. WHO? REALISTICALLY FOR THOSE YOUTH WHO WERE NOW INNER GROUP CARE WHO AREN'T GOING TO STAY HONESTY RTP CARE FOR WHILE BUT ARE GOING TO GO TO HOME BASED CARE. THE REALITY IS THEY WILL LARGELY. B. CARED FOR BY FAMILY BY PEOPLE THEY ALREADY KNOW. AND IT ISN'T A MATTER OF GOING OUT RECRUITING AND ABSTRACT. PERSON TO SAY WOULD YOU BE AVAILABLE TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEBODY AND WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT LATER IT WILL BE. WERE STARTING FROM THE LENS OF THE CHILD AND SAYING. WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHO LOVES YOU WHO'S AVAILABLE WHO IF WE ENGAGED? WELL AND SUPPORT THEM AND PROVIDE SERVICES. WHO WILL STEP UP BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU MEAN THAT YOU ARE PART OF THEM? IT WOULDN'T WORK WHEN ARM. DID THE KERN COUNTY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AUTHORED A WILSON WE'VE WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A WALLS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM PRIMARILY FROM GROUPS. HOME BUT THE QUESTION I WAS ACCOMPANIST PEOPLE WHEN CHILDREN A WILLING IS ARE THE. IS SHE RUNNING FROM SOMETHING OR TO SOMETHING. THE DIFFERENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE CITING. AND. IF IT IS. IF. DOES THE CHILD OVER THE WANNABES. AND CAN WE WORK WITH THEM. FIND THE. APPROPRIATE PLACE THE RIGHT PLACE. THAT THEY WANT TO BE NOT SOMEWHERE WE PUT THEM BECAUSE THAT WAS. AND HOW WE USE TO DO IT. SO WITH THAT I WILL NOW MOVES TO PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ISSUE TWO. PLEASE COME FORWARD AND. TAKE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MAC WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THEIR NUMBER OF SPECIFIC. PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENT THAT WE. US SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE. ASSOCIATED WITH NEW WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH CCR THAT'S NEVER BEEN FUNDED WE'VE HAD A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP VERY PRODUCTIVE IMPAIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON FAIR FUNDING FOR CCR. THE LOC ASSESSMENTS IN THE KANSAS SETTLEMENTS ARE NEW WORKLOAD AND WE PUT AN ESTIMATE OUT TO YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON WHAT WE THINK THAT WORKLOAD IS. AND. WE ALSO PUT A NOTE REQUEST FOR% FUNDING TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG OF OUR A FAIT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE LEGISLATURE ON WHAT MIGHT BE IN THE MAY REVISION BUT THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. I'M FUNDING FEATURES AND WE POINT OUT THE FOR ELLA SEA IN CANS. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE NOT SERVE OPTION ALL SORT OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE NICE THERE ACTUALLY. MANDATES UNDER PROP THIRTY THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CCR. THE LAST PANEL REALLY US ALSO BOMB STRUCK. THAT. VERY SORT OF SYMPATHETIC AND AT AT COURT THAT WORKER BOMB THE NASA DO YOU FLOSS CENTER. ALL SAID. KIDS NEED TO BE WITH FAMILIES THEY NEED TO BE SUPPORTED THEIR TRAUMA NEEDS TO BE IDENTIFIED EARLY AND THEY NEED TO BE WITH FAMILIES. AND WE COMPLETELY AGREE AND WE'RE PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH. AB TWENTY FORTY THREE IN THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE BILL TO KEEP KIDS WITH FAMILIES AND TO KEEP PLACEMENTS FROM BEING DISRUPTED BECAUSE WE AGREE THAT ALL KIDS. BOB SHOULD BE WITH FAMILIES. AND FINALLY JUST LIKE TO SAY. ARM. THAT FROM THAT STANDPOINT OF THE COUNTIES. OUR CONCERN ISN'T THAT THIS IS ABOUT. WORK THAT'S TOO HARD FOR US. AND. ARE CONCERNED ISN'T THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE THINGS THAT THE DIRECTORS POINTED OUT ABOUT. HOW TO ENGAGE KIDS RIGHT THE QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE THE TIME? AND. OUR THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE MADE WHEN WE WERE MAKING IT UP. WHERE THE ACCURATE AND COULD WE UNWITTINGLY DO SOMETHING WORSE? ARM BECAUSE OF THE HOPE. THAT ON TWELVE THIRTY ONE EVERYTHING WILL BE IN PLACE. TOM AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST RESUBMIT THAT THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY VITAL AND IMPORTANT POINT AND I THINK IF WE DISMISS IT. AS. THE CONCERNS OF AN ANXIOUS BUREAUCRACY AND NOT THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE PROGRAM WHO UNDERSTAND THE KIDS. UNDERSTAND THE YOUTH UNDERSTAND THE PROVIDERS THEN WE RUN THE RISK OF. DOING WORSE AND AND THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE TO US. THANK YOU SIR.

THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN BENEFITS CASES EVERY SINGLE YEAR WE ARE WELL VERSED IN THE SPECIALIZED CARE TOOL AND WE HAVE STUDIED THE LEVEL OF CARE TOOL AND WE DON'T THINK THERE IS A SMALL RISK. THAT CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE ASSESSED PROPERLY UNDER THE LEVEL OF CARE TOOL AND THERE'S A LARGE RISK THAT THEY WILL LOSE SPECIALIZED CARE AS A RESULT OF THIS NEW SYSTEM BEING ROLLED OUT. AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN WE'RE MAKING THE COUNTIES CHANGE THEIR SPECIALIZED CARE PLANS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE SPECIALIZED CARE PLANS ARE GOING TO BE AND THOSE ALSO HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED ALONG WITH THE LOC TOOL.

AND I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT. WE SUPPORT FUNDING AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT. AND ON THE WORK BEING DONE TO PROVIDE STABILITY IN THAT THE WORK THAT CIC IS DOING TO PUSH FOR STABILITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE. ON. WE ARE THANKFUL THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING ON INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE AND TRYING TO GET. THE SERVICES IN THE FAMILIES WHEN IT'S NEEDED. THAT ON AND AND WERE SUPPORTIVE OF TWENTY FOUR SEVEN URGENT RESPONSE IT MINES FOR FOSTER PARENTS. AND. THAT AS AND. AS A AN ORGANIZATION WE HAVE. A CASAS ACROSS THE STATE ON ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS WORKING WITH ALMOST. THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH AND THEY'RE SEEING. ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF CCR IMPLEMENTATION AND I KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DREAM BECOMES A REALITY. ON AND I THINK ALL OF YOU WHO ARE WORKING ON THE DIFFERENT PIECES. AND AND AND MAKING SURE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION IS EFFECTIVE AND WE ALSO SUPPORT ON MAKING SURE THAT THE LOC. IS AN ACCURATE INVALIDATED AS AS YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING IT BUT ON THANK YOU ALL FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND AND LET'S CONTINUE. THINKING THANK YOU. MY NAME'S DOUG JOHNSON OF THE CALIFORNIA LIFE TO TELL THE FAMILY SERVICES WE HAVE A DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONS WAS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. ARM I WORK WITH THOSE OF OUR MEMBERS WHO OPERATE GRUPOM SUGGEST YOUR TEEPEES. I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF ENSURING THAT THAT COUNTIES HAVE FOR THE CHILDREN WITH REALLY CHALLENGING NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE STR TP BEDS WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED. I'M. THAT'S A REALLY CRUCIAL GOAL THAT WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE FOR THAT SMALL SUBSET OF CHILDREN WHO NEED IT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. HOWEVER I DO NOT THINK THAT. GIVING UP WATER GOAL OF MAKING THE TRANSITION. FROM GRUPOM TESTER TO BE BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR IS A GOOD IDEA. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO FORGE. THROUGH THAT PROCESS NOW ABOUT TWENTY OF OUR MEMBERS. ABOUT OF THE TWENTY SEVEN THAT HELP OF A WE OWE MISTER BE LICENSES ARE OUR MEMBERS. WE HAVE A LOT OF MEMBERS IN THOSE SIXTY PERCENT OF SIXTY AGENCY QUEUE TO GET THE REST YOUR TO BE LICENSES OTHERS ARE WORKING THROUGH A COUNTY APPROVAL PROCESS. ANYTHING THAT SLOWS THAT DOWN IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WE HAVE A NUMBER MEMBERS WITH US YOUR TO PEACE ARE NOW CARRYING SIGNIFICANT VACANCIES. THEY'RE NOT FULL. AND IF WITH FIXED COSTS THAT IS DRAINING THEIR RESOURCES FAST IF WE DON'T PUSH FORWARD WITH THIS QUICKLY. TO FRUITION IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WAS GOING TO GIVE US MORE TIME AND MORE RESOURCES LATER. IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY KILL SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT WERE NOW BUILDING. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THAT AND WE GET THE ALLIANCE ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THE COUNTY PLACING AGENCIES AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS SO THAT WE ALL GET. THE END OF THE DAY THE RESOURCES WE NEED FOR THOSE HIGH INCOME KIDS HIGH HIGH NEEDS KIDS AND ALSO SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT TRANSITION FOR THOSE KIDS. OUT OF FOSTER CARE OUT OF GROUP CARE AND TOWARDS HOME AND PERMANENCY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HELLO MY NAME IS ANGELA SOME HAVE. AND I'M A GRANDMOTHER FILES. EIGHT CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE WHICH FIVE WERE PLACED IN MY HOME. ALL HAVE BEEN MEDICAL DISABILITIES HOME BEING TRAUMATIZED. BY BEING PLACED IN FOSTER HOME MORE REMOVED FROM ALL. MY PROBLEM WITH THIS PROGRAM IT'S BECAUSE. I MONTROSE FINANCES BECAME A GROUP PARLIAMENT FROM DAY ONE WITHOUT THE KIDS INVOLVED IN MY HOUSE. I HELP THREE D. RATES IN MY HOME. AND THE OTHER TWO OF MEDICATIONS ONE IS A THREE YEAR OLD IS NOT MY BIOLOGICAL BUT BECAUSE HE'S A PART OF THAT FAMILY IS MY TH GRADE CHILD AS WELL. I TOOK DOES KITTEN IN GOOD FAITH. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD SOME STABILITY IN THEIR LIFE AND I HAVE BUSTED. MY BUT. SEEM TO GO THERE KEEP GETTING THEIR NEEDS MET BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS. HAS NOT DEPEND FOR THEIR. I HAD TO GET MY GRANDDAUGHTER A NINE YEAR OLD WE MOVED OUT OF MY HOUSE LAST THURSDAY. BECAUSE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT I COULD NOT TAKE CARE OF BY MYSELF AND I PLEADED FOR MONTHS. TO GET SERVICES FOR HER THAT WOULD HELP HER IN THAT. AREA WHICH NEVER HAPPENED. I DID GET ANY REIMBURSEMENTS THEY DISAPPROVE MY HOUSE IN DECEMBER. I CAN'T TAKE FIVE KIDS IT A NISSAN SENTRA TO THEIR SITE APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE. YOU CAN'T TRANSPORT THAT MANY KIDS IN ON THE SATS ENTRY. SO THESE FUND OF THE VERY NECESSARY FOR ANYBODY THIS BUILDING WITH KIDS AND THREATEN ME IN MY SITUATION HELP FIGHT WHEN TRYING TO GET ALL EIGHT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE SYSTEM SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. AND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN TOGETHER UP UNTIL THEY GOT BACK WITH ME. SO THAT WAS MY PURPOSE AND GOAL TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THOSE KIDS BECAME A FAMILY AGAIN. AT I'LL THE ANSWERS HELP. AND THAT'S WHAT ABOUT KITTY. SO BANKS FOR YOU GUYS PUT PATH THAT BE GO UNFORTUNATELY ARE TO DEBT BILL DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME BECAUSE IT'S JUST COMING OUT BUT I'M THE WAITED NEEDED MOST BECAUSE I HAVE FIVE KIDS. THAT NEED MY HELP AND I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP FOR THEM AND LET HIM GO JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT GETTING FRIENDLY BUT AT THE SAME TOKEN. THEY NEED THOSE WORDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE DOT DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I HAVE TO ASK PEOPLE TO COME TO MY HOUSE AND. HELP WE TRANSPORT THEM. YELLOW LATEST OUTSIDE MEDICATIONS THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT I'M DEALING WITH IT ONE OUT AND I BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE OUR MARIN GRUPO. I DON'T GET PAID GROUP HOME I DON'T EVEN GET PAID FOSTER CARE FEES SO THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SOON VERY SOON THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. SUZANNE AND DEFEND MY CHILDREN NOW HERE TO SPEAK ON THE LEVEL OF CARE ISSUE AND FIRST IS ONE I THINK THE DEPARTMENT FOR MOVING TO A LEVEL OF CARE SYSTEM. AYE DETERMINING AYE RATES BASED ON THE NEEDS OF A CHILD IS AMAZING THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE TIME TO GET IT RIGHT. AND TO VALIDATE THE TOOL AND TO MAKE SURE IT'S GONNA WORK AND THEN YOU DON'T TAKE TIME TO IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY YOU ACTUALLY DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. WE'VE JUST S. B. AWAY TO GO THROUGH AN RFA PROCESS THAT WAS RUSHED AND CHAOTIC AND THOUSANDS OF FAMILY SUFFERED NEEDLESSLY FOR A YEAR BECAUSE OF THAT AND YOU'RE HAVING TO FIX IT NOW. WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING THAT YOU NOT DO THE SAME THING WITH LSE THAT YOU SLOW DOWN THAT YOU VALIDATED THAT YOU GET IT RIGHT THAT YOU WORK WITH REACHES RESEARCHERS. THAT YOU MAKE SURE BEFORE YOU ROLL IT OUT OF THESE FAMILIES YOU KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THEM. A HAVING A GOOD GOAL OR A VISION ISN'T ENOUGH YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ACTUALLY WHAT'S DOING RIGHT FOR THESE FAMILIES DON'T ASK THEM TO SUFFER. WHILE YOU FLY THE PLANE AND FIX IT AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SUFFER. AND THAT JUST SHOULDN'T HAPPEN SOME ASKING FOR A DELAY UNMASKING FOR TRUE VALIDATION OF THE TOOL BEFORE IT MOVES FORWARD BIG. THANK YOU MA'AM. A LUCY STILL SEE THE CARTER YOU PLUS CENTER I'M JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANTED TO ADD. THAT ONE IS WE'RE REALLY. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE RESOURCES FOR. RESOURCE PARENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. AND IN THE LEVEL OF CARE CONVERSATION. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOCUS REALLY DOES STAY ON THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN. AND THEN THE OTHER THING IN THINKING ABOUT SYSTEM REFORM. IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN ITERATIVE PROCESS. IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE. A BIG STEP FORWARD AND. SOME MID COURSE CORRECTIONS SO I THINK THAT THAT'S. REALISTIC TO EXPECT AND AND WE AGREE THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CHILDREN ARE THE FAMILIES. EVER. BUT WE DO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT ISN'T ENTERED OF PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE TO I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS TWENTY QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE. AND I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVIEW. THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS BUT I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT. I'VE SAID IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SIT UP HERE AND TALK ABOUT. A. PEOPLE'S LIVES. LIKE FOR THEIR BUDGET LINE ITEMS AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO THE THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING FOR ME. THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF IS THAT WE TALK ABOUT. KIDS AND ADULTS WITH NEEDS AS IF THEY'RE LINE ITEMS AND I CAN APPRECIATE THE. THE. OVERWHELMING. JOB THAT THE DEPARTMENT HOUSE BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO. TALK ABOUT A WILL WE'RE NOT GOING TO FUND IT THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA FIND IT NEXT YEAR AS IF. KIDS ARE. WAITING. A. AROUND EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ON HOLD AND THERE'LL BE NO ISSUES IN THE MEANTIME AND I'M. I'M NOT TRYING TO. TO SAY THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BUT BUT I KNOW THAT THE THE JOB THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS. IS. TREMENDOUS BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SO MUCH ON YOUR TABLE BUT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT KIDS AND I HEAR THE STORIES ABOUT REAL. LIVES THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED IT'S IT'S HARD FOR ME TO FIRST OF ALL EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB I CAN IMAGINE. A. HOW? YOU CAN YOU KNOW GO DAYS TODAY WITHOUT HAVING THE THE STRESS. IT THE STRESS. THAT I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW THAT WE FEEL ON A DAILY BASIS AND I GET TO DO THIS YOU KNOW TWICE A WEEK. AND YOU NEED TO DO THIS EVERY DAY AND SO I I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I APPRECIATE THAT WORK BUT I NEED. WE NEED SOME HELP BECAUSE THESE KIDS ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND THE FAMILIES ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND I KEEP. I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW MY STORY BY NUYS SAY THAT EVERY TIME A TEACHER. I ON TOP OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE AT HOME. I WOULD THEY'RE EXPECTED TO GO TO SCHOOL AND LEARN. THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WHEN WHEN. THE STORY ABOUT THE THE THE MOM BEING BEAT AND THE KID BOTH CHILD WITNESSING THIS EVERY DAY AND HE STILL HAS TO GO TO SCHOOL. IT'S HEARTBREAKING. AND I ED AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE STRESS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE UNDER. BUT. SOME POINT. WE NEED AND LIKETHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS OVERSIGHT HE. IS THAT WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS. I DON'T KNOW FASTER I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN ON WHAT WE NEED BECAUSE WHAT I HEARD TODAY. I'VE I'VE HEARD. FINDING THE APPROVAL PROCESS. AT THAT THE LOCK OF PROTOCOL ALL OF THESE ISSUES BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEM LONGER WE TAKE. TWO TO TO FIGURE THIS OUT THERE'S KIDS THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED ARE YOU WHAT WAS THAT THE OTHERS EIGHT HUNDRED KIDS AND LA COUNTY WITHOUT PLACEMENT. I THE HOW IS IT THAT. WE. I HAVE. MONEY AVAILABLE AND IT'S TAKING SO LONG FOR SOME OF THESE PARENTS AYE ULCER I WAS TOO LONG TOO MANY THINGS TO TAKE NOTES ON I WAS TRYING TO KEEP UP BUT. THE OTHER THING THAT I HEARD WAS. THE. THE KIDS ARE BEING REMOVED FROM HOMES. BECAUSE OF WHATEVER ISSUES AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE WAS WE ARE SCOURING THE KIDS. BUT THEN WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILIES THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE THESE KIDS IN BUT YET ARE REMOVED THERE I'M SURE THEY HAVE TO BE DISCOURAGED AND WON'T TAKE ANOTHER CHILD AND. BECAUSE NOW IN THIS PROCESS DIDN'T WORK SO NOT ONLY ARE WE HARMING THE CHILDREN BUT WE'RE LOSING FAMILIES THAT CAN BE POTENTIAL. A CAREGIVERS FOR THESE KIDS AND I'M NOT TALKING. DARK DON'T LIKE PORN PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO PLACE BLAME ON ANYBODY. BUT AT SOME POINT. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ASSIST YOUR DEPARTMENT AND ALL OF THESE. TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES IT'S HEART BREAKING. AND AGAIN I CAN APPRECIATE THE STRESS YOU'RE UNDER BECAUSE I TRY. TO. OF. BE HERE TODAY AND TRY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE TOMORROW BECAUSE IF I SIT. AND AND THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME I WOULD BE A MESS I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE IF MY KIDS. WERE UNDER IN THE SYSTEM I CAN'T. MY DAUGHTER SICK RIGHT NOW AND I'M THINKING MY GOD WHAT AM I GONNA DO BUT THANK GOD I HAVE. BUT HELP I HAVE A CARE GIVER. I HAVE MEDICAL INSURANCE. SHOT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR YESTERDAY AND I WASN'T ABLE TO GO WITH HER AND MY MY SITTER TOOKER. TOOK CARE OF THE MEDICINE BROUGHT SO THAT I CAN DO WHAT I DO HERE. AND SO I'M LUCKY. I FEEL BLESSED IN THAT RESPECT THAT I AM ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE I CAN STILL HAVE MY KIDS WITH ME BUT THERE'S FAMILIES HERE. THAT. ARE COMING TO US ENDS. LITERALLY SCREAMING FOR HELP. THE IT IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY ON ARM AS TO WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU. FIRST YOU YOU DID A VERY BIG THING WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB ONE TEN DOT REALLY HELPED RESOLVE A LOOMING PROBLEM. THE. THING WE WILL THEN ASK YOU TO DO IS WE WILL COME BACK TO YOU IN THE MAY REVISION WITH OUR PROPOSAL FOR CRITICAL AT THE LONG TERM. SOLUTION RIGHT BUT BUT MAY I COME IN THERE AND JUST A SECOND SO YES WE PASSED THE BE. UP WHEN TEN BY. THE FAMILIES ARE TESTIFYING THAT IT'S TAKING SIX MONTHS FOR THEM TO GET ANY KIND OF FUN. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES THAT THEY'RE COMING FROM BECAUSE THE THE RESOURCES OF THEIR. AND I KNOW THAT IT'S UP THIS ORGANIZATIONAL LIFTS UPSET OR THAT THEY'VE THEY'VE GOT TO WORK TO. PUT PART OF THAT SORT OF. WE. MANY NOT MANY SOME ISSUES. OUR FOR PRE DATING. CONTINUOUS CARE REFORM SO FOR EXAMPLE. SOME COUNTIES ALWAYS MADE A PRACTICE IN THE PAST WHEN A CHILD WAS PLACED THEY WOULD MAKE A THE MEDIA PAYMENT THROUGH EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE OR CAL WORKS OR WHATEVER. SOME COUNTIES DIDN'T MAKE THAT. PAYMENT IMMEDIATELY THEY WAITED UNTIL THEY'VE APPROVED. THROUGH THE FOSTER CARE APPROVAL PROCESS. WHICH NOW THAT THAT WOULD DIDN'T CREATE THE CRISIS HOWEVER THEN BECAUSE IT DIDN'T TAKE OF LAW. WHEN WE WENT TO THE RFA PROCESS WHICH EVERYBODY DID BECAUSE IT WAS A GOOD THING TO DO BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU ARE ESTABLISHING AT THE BEGINNING. THAT POTENTIALLY THIS IS A HOME THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE PERMANENTLY FOR STABILITY. IF REUNIFICATION DOESN'T WORK. HOWEVER IT ADDED TIME TO THE PROCESS AND SO THAT'S REALLY SORT OF THE FIX. YOU DID. ARM. PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO SORT OF MOVE THROUGH A I MEAN IT JUST WENT INTO EFFECT. IN MARCH SO IT MADE WERE IN APRIL. SO. WOULD WANTED AFFECT ABLE FIRST WORD PEOPLE ELEVEN SO THERE THERE PROBABLY IS A LITTLE BIT OF THROUGHPUT TIME HERE. ARM BUT. THAT WILL BE SORT OF THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION THAT AS I SAID WILL COME TO YOU IN THE MAY REVISION RIGHT WITH A LONG TERM THANK YOU BUT. AND AND I SAID THIS IN MY SAY THEM. I AM A LOT OF COMMITTEES THAT I SIT ON AND I'M SAYING I SAID IT ON MONDAY. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED THE PROCESSES YET WE'RE THE ONES THAT CREATE THE PROCESS. SO I MEAN IF WE CREATE A PROP THEN WHY DO WE MAKE IT SO COMPLICATED. AYE THAT'S MY RIGHT YOU KNOW IT WE GO AGAIN BACK. YOU KNOW WHO WE FELT FEET A SET I THINK BURKE IF SHE WAS WHAT WAS HAVE THE WORDS OF IT'S REALLY CRITICAL IS A CULTURE CHANGE HERE. AND BOTH TAKE A LITTLE BIT AYE AYE EDITOR LIKE THEM AND ACTOR LA AND LIKE ONE BUT BUT FOR ME AND AND I. AM NOT GOING BACK TO MY TEACHING ANALOGY IS THAT IF I CREATE A TEST. AND THEN COMPLAIN THAT THE KISS FAILED THE TEST BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HARD WHILE I CREATE AT THE TEST. AND SO SO. YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT'S THE THE EVENT IS NOT JUST FROM YOU I HEAR IT FROM THIS WHOLE PLACE IS THAT. THIS IS A COMPLETE IT'S A COMPLICATED THIS IS COMPLICATE WILL OF COURSE WE ARE CREATING IT AND IF IT'S AT SOME POINT HOW DO I. ENCOURAGE OR HOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE YOUR DEPARTMENTS OR THE COUNTIES TO PUT A HARD INTO WITH THESE PRODUCTS A FEW THERE'S A THERE'S A BIG HEART. IT EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT THEM THEN WHERE IS THE URGENCY. I DON'T SEE ANY URGENCY BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS SICK I WAS ON THE PHONE AND AND IT'S. IT'S A REALLY SMALL. YOU KNOW A A EXAMPLE BUT I WAS ON THE PHONE CALLING MAKING SURE THAT SOMEBODY COULD TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR THAT SOMEBODY CAN YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT WAS. PERSONAL BECAUSE I WAS LIKE FREAKED OUT. THAT THAT I WAS HERE AND I CAN BE WITH MY DAUGHTER. SO THE BET NEXT BEST THING WAS TO CALL SOMEBODY TO HELP ME AT SOME POINT WHERE IS THAT URGENCY HOW CAN WE. A INJECT THE URGENCY. TO. SOME OF THE FOLKS AND LOOK THAT IS NOT BE. A. BLIND TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOME WE CALL THEM COUNTY EMPLOYEES THEY'VE EMPLOYEES ARE CITY EMPLOYEES WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL THEM THAT WE JUST KNOW THAT THE THE NORMAL. A A PIECE OF THOSE COUNTY EMPLOYEES IS LIKE AND WILL LET ME GO GO LET ME GO LUNCH I'LL BE BACK WITH YOU JUST FILL OUT THIS FORM. AND THAT REPUTATION ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WEAK CREED THAT REPUTATION WAS CREATED BECAUSE OF THE RESULTS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE ON A DAILY BASIS AND I I. I DON'T KNOW AND I FEEL FRUSTRATED. AND I TRIED TO HOLD BACK BUT I YOU KNOW THAT'S FIRST OF ALL THAT'S NOT MY STYLE. AS YOU ALL HAVE SEEN BUT SECONDLY I DON'T WANT IT ATTACK AND BLAME YOU FOR ANY OF THIS BUT THEN. WHERE IS THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE URGENCY OF WHAT THESE FAMILIES AND? THE FAMILIES BUT THE KIDS THAT THE KIDS NEED TO WHERE WE STEP IN AND HELP THEM ABSOLUTE. I I HOPE I'M NOT SOUNDING DEFINATLY WHEN I SAY THIS. I THINK MISTER JOHNSON FROM THE ALLIANCE MADE THE POINT WHEN HE GOT UP HERE WE CREATE THE URGENCY BY SAYING THIS HAS GOT TO GET DONE. THAT'S WHAT WE GET THE URCHINS START THAT DIRECT LIGHT BURNED THIS HAS TO GET DONE RIGHT. I'M WITH YOU. YES I'M. I MEAN. IF I COULD GET ONE MORE VOTE ROAD HERE. I MEAN DON'T RUN RAMPAGE WE'RE TOLD THEM THE SAME PAPER ON THE SAME PAGE RIGHT NOW SO SO. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME AND LIKE I SAID IT'S FRUSTRATION NOT BECAUSE OF OF WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WHAT'S NOT GETTING DONE AND YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY. THAT'S WHY EUROPE EUROPE BECAUSE THAT'S WHO YOU ANSWER TO AND TO ME I CAN'T GOAL AND AND DIRECT YOU KNOW LOCAL COUNTIES AND GO YELL AT A STAFF MEMBER BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING THE PAST THAT. YOUR IT. I MEAN THIS IS WHERE I YOU KNOW I CAN. EXPRESS MY FRUSTRATIONS SO I DO HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT. IT I I KNOW WE ARE ALL GOING TO TALK ABOUT BUT THE THE THE LOCK TOOL THAT'S ALSO BE CONCERNED. HOW IS IT AND IF I DON'T KNOW ALL ABOUT IT SO IF YOU CAN HELP ME THE LOCK TO WAS DEVELOPED BY WHOM? IT WAS DEVELOPED IN A CONSULTATIVE PROCESS WITH COUNTY FARM CHILD WELFARE FOLKS AND OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOME ADVOCATE SAT IN ON THE PROCESS I DON'T WANT TO CLAIM THAT THEY BLESSED TO KNOW NONE BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT OKAY SO THAT'S MY QUESTION BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS SIMPLE. ACTS I UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE WERE THERE WERE WRITTEN RECOMMENDATIONS MADE THAT WERE NOT FOLLOWED. AND THAT THE BILL SOMETIMES HAPPEN AYE THE BILL NO NO NO NO NO RIGHT TO IT WHICH I'M NOT GONNA VERSION OF A BILL SOMETIME HAPPEN WE'RE EXPECTED TO IMPLEMENT THIS NO. AND THOUGH SOMETIMES HAPPEN IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH ANSWER BECAUSE IT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF CARE FOR CHILDREN. BOWLS DOT SOMETIMES HAPPEN IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH ANSWER THE THAT THE COUNTY TEAM THAT WORKED ON DEVELOPING IT BASED ON WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SPECIALIZED CARE. INCREMENTAL TOOLS. IN USE IN THE STATE THAT'S PROBABLY AS GOOD A STANDARD AS ONE CAN GET IN ADVANCE NO I FULLY GET THIS NOTION OF. WELL HOW DO YOU TEST IT WELL HOW DO YOU TEST IT HOME WELL. I USE THE EXAMPLE OF RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL WILL BE THAT OF YOUR LONG PILOT FOR COUNTIES AND IT SEEMED TO BE GOING GREAT AND THEN YOU GO TO THE NEXT PLACE. AND THERE'S A HICCUP SO. AT SOME POINT HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. START AND AS WE GET THE RESULTS IN IF THERE ARE INCONSISTENT FIRST. NO ONE WHO CURRENTLY HAS A SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENT LOSES THEIR SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENT. AS THE LOC IS IMPLEMENT THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE. THANKS TO THE BACK OF DONE. SECOND. THE LOC RATES. WITH THE EXCEPTIONOF FOR THE OLDEST KIDS IN AFRICA IS THE LOC RATES ARE HIGHER THAN ALL OF THE PAID RATE SPREE LOC. SO. THEY'RE IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE PAYMENT WHAT. AB THAT WHILE THEY'RE DUMB DUMBER WHICH WAY IF WE DO THE ALIVE AND I MEAN WE CAN HANDLE NIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE ASSUMING THAT IT WENT INTO EFFECT APRIL FIRST THE MONEY'S GOING TO GO THROUGH. NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT FEMA. AND THE. WITH THE YELLOW SEA TOUR. EVEN AT THE ALOSI ONE LEVEL THE BASIC LEVEL ARM THERE'S. THERE'S NO HARM. THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE S. C. EYES DON'T LOSE THEM NOW THERE IS A QUESTION THAT THE ADVOCATES POSE IT'S A VALID ONE WHICH IS WHAT IF. IN THE PAST. THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AN S. C. I.. ABOVE THE OLD RATE HOW DOES THAT GET WORKED IN THE FUTURE AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING BEFORE WE CAN BE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES TO SAY. IF. SOMETIMES HAVE VERY SMALL ASCII RATES YOU KNOW. THIRTY BUCKS HUNDRED BUCKS TWO HUNDRED BUCKS. THE CHANCES ARE THE LOC GOOD EXCEED THAT OVER THE GATE. SOME COUNTIES NOTABLY I MEAN ONE OF OUR BIGGEST COUNTY HAS SOME. VERY HIGH A LOT ASCII RITZ. ALL THERE BUT THAT ARE DESCENDING IS THEIR PLAN TO CONTINUE DOING THEIR S. C. AYE SYSTEM UNTIL THEY HAVE REVISED. AND. AGAIN. IN ESSENCE THERE IS NO HARM CERTAINLY NO HARM TO ANYBODY WHO'S CURRENTLY. I MEAN THEY CAN ONLY GET. A HIGHER AMOUNT. AND THEN. IF. AS WE MOVE FORWARD THERE IS EVIDENCE COMING IN THAT SAYS SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ON. IT INCREMENTAL INCREASE A BOLD THAT AND FOR SOME REASON DIDN'T THEN THAT'S WHAT WE ARE JUST GOING FORWARD BUT IF WE STOP AND SAY NOPE WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS THING. I LOOKED EIGHT DECIMAL PLACES. ACCURATE BEFORE WE START WE HAVE IN STOCK. THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH. OKAY. THIS IS YEAH WE SHOULD HAVE A DAY LONG MEETING. MEETINGS ARE HOSTILE TO BE HONEST I'M NOT I DON'T KNOW AND I ALREADY SHADE UPON SHADE THAT BUT RIGHT OUT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I SAID I APPRECIATE. THE AMOUNT OF STRESS THAT YOU MUST BE UNDER THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE NOT COMING HERE IN AMMAN SITTING UP THERE NOW. UNITS ITEMS BUT. BUT AGAIN THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT THE THESE ARE KIDS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TOTAL YOU KNOW AND AND AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING WHAT THEY NEED. THE FAMILIES ARE NOT RECEIVING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND THEN THE THE THE. LET ME SWITCH TO NOW THE GROUP HOME RIGHT SITUATION UP MORE TALKING ABOUT. GETTING THESE KIDS OUT OF GROUP HOMES BUT YET THE. FAMILIES. ARE NOT GETTING WHAT FAMILIES. THAT EVEN TRUST THE SYSTEM TO EVEN PARTICIPATE IN IN IN BEING FOSTER PARENTS SO HOW IS IT YOU KNOW IT. IT SOUNDS ALL GREAT AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I HEAR THIS IS WHAT I HEAR. THIS IS GREAT. UP WE HAVE A. BOTH THE WORDS AND I HAVE TO BE REALLY HONEST WRAPAROUND SERVICES JUST SOMETIMES TO SOUND LIKE A WORD. THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A PROPER ROB WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR THESE FAMILIES AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AND ON PAPER IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S AMAZING. THE I A IF YOU PRESENTED AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLANT BUT REALISTICALLY IT'S NOT. IMPLEMENTABLE. IF THAT'S EVEN A WORD BUT BECAUSE. HOW ARE WE GOING TO? CLOSE DOWN THESE GROUP HOMES WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE UP ARE A PROCESS NUMBER ONE TO GET THESE FAMILIES APPROVED WHICH I HOPE THAT. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID THEY WERE WORKING ON. BUT WE'RE GONNA PUT THEM. SO WE'RE CLOSING THESE GROUP HOMES BUT YET WE'VE GOT NO FAMILIES TO TAKE THESE KIDS AND THEN. THESE ARE NOT. BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF TRAUMA THAT THEY'VE HAD MOVING AROUND THIS IS NOT. YOU KNOW YOU. THEY ALL COME AND TAKE THIS KID ALL OF COURSE WE'VE GOT NO ISSUES NO PROBLEMS THESE ARE KIDS WITH. REALLY SERIOUS TRAUMA IN THEIR LIVES AND. IF WE DON'T FIND. THE RIGHT PLACEMENT FOR THEM THEN WE'RE DONE BUT THEN. THE RIGHT PLACEMENT THAT'S AVAILABLE WE'RE NOT DOING WHAT WE. CAN FOR THEM SO BLOW RIGHT POLICEMEN MAY NOT EVEN WANT TO BE A FOSTER PARENT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT BY THEM EITHER. AND SO I CAN'T RECONCILE. IN MY MIND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS. CLOSE THE GROUP HOMES OR. MOVE THEM INTO YOU KNOW FAMILY THE FAMILIES AVAILABLE SO HOW IS IT THAT THIS IS GOING TO AND THEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN I'LL BE BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. I. LITTLE WHILE AGO WE AGREED THAT WE GOTTA GET IT DONE NOW RIGHT OKAY AT THE ANSWER OKAY. BUT BUT BUT YES SO WHAT I WILL I WILL. LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW. THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS BUT THE THE FUND BE THE TAKE AWAY. FROM ME THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TODAY'S WE GOT TO GET IT DONE NOW NUMBER ONE IF YOU NEED HELP. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU BUT SO THAT YOU CAN ASSIST THE COUNTIES IN DOING THIS BECAUSE THAT'S I I DON'T WANNA BE HERE NEXT YEAR AND WE ARE HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION I'VE SAY IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THE FAMILIES THEY CAN THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING UP THANK YOU FOR COMING YEAR I MEAN THE BRAVERY FROM THESE THESE LADIES TO TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO US ABOUT IT. BUT THEY'RE DATING COME JUST TO SPEAK. BECAME FOR SOME RESOLUTION BECAME FOR SOME RESULTS AND SO. FOR NOW BECAUSE I KNOW I'M. INTO A I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT I DO EXPECT THAT THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD WAS WE GET TO IT WE HAVE TO DO IT TODAY THAT I WILL GET SOME FOLLOW UP. FROM YOU OR THE DEPARTMENT AS TO WHAT HOW WE'RE DOING AND HOW. REALLY THAT'S THE LOCK PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE TESTED. AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE THE DEADLINE OF TWELVE THIRTY ONE FOR ME TO BE HONEST I THINK WE SHOULD. A DELAY IT UNTIL WE ARE SURE A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE EVEN NINETY PERCENT SURE THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT EVEN AT THAT LEVEL. IT WERE GOING TO DRAMATIZE AND RE TRAUMATIZE MORE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. I SHARE IN YOUR DESIRE TO GET THIS DONE. I THINK WHAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO ENSURES THAT WE GET IT DONE RIGHT. CAN WE DO WELL BY FAMILIES. AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS AND FOR SPECIFIC AREAS. FIRST I WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE RFA. I. THINK THAT MANY OF US CAN AGREE THAT THE DELAYS WE'VE SEEN ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND DO WANT TO SEE. WHAT THE YOU HAVE IMPLEMENTED HOW WE HAVE INCREASED AND STREAMLINED AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK IS FOR YOU TO? REPORT BACK TO US THE BACKLOG AT THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISION TALKING GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOU'RE DOING WHAT THE RFA PROCESS. IN TERMS OF FUNDING AT TIME OF PLACEMENT. I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO DO AS GENEROUS OF A PROPOSAL AS POSSIBLE. AT MAY REVISION TO BEGIN ON JULY FIRST. I'VE HEARD THE FAMILIES AND REALLY BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND NEED. US TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN DO THAT. IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF CARE TOOL IMPLEMENTATION. GIVEN THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY IN THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE PILOT. AND OUR DESIRE TO HAVE A YIELD A GREAT TOOL. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER A SIXTY DAY DELAY. OR HOW CAN WE INSURE THAT WE GET IT IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY. NOT ARAMBULA WITH WITH RESPECT AYE I CAN'T ASSURE A SIXTY DAY DELAY WHEN I CAN ASSURE IS A NUANCED VERY THOUGHTFUL VERY REFLECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION IF ANYTHING IS. PRODUCING. RESULTS. THAT WOULD IN A SENSE. MIMIC A PILOT THAT SHOWS US THAT WE'RE GETTING. FALSE NEGATIVES OR FALSE POSITIVES. ALL WE WILL ANSWER EXCUSE BUT WHAT YET WHY CAN'T WE DO A SIXTY DAY DELAY IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT TOO BECAUSE IT. IF YOU'RE WE ARE IN A WE ARE COMMITTING TO. GETTING THINGS DONE. KLAY WE HAVE TO START. WE HAVE TO START IF WE DELAY. A WE DELAY BE IF WE DELAY BE WE TO LACI. THESE ARE SORT OF GIVENS AND I WOULD RATHER. START AS I SAID IN A NUANCED REFLECTIVE MODE WITH THE ABILITY TO. CORRECT STOP OR WHATEVER NGUYEN RESULTS ARE COMING IN IF WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO VALIDATE WHAT ABOUT IT WHERE WE'RE GONNA FIND WE CANNOT PICK SOME PLACES TO START. BUT WHAT IT MEANS ARMED. THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WATER IS A GRADUAL START WEBER WHAT WE'RE STARTING WITH. OR THE. OR THE CHILDREN COMING INTO CARE NEW. AFTER A CERTAIN DATE NO WE'VE ALREADY MADE THE PROFICIENT OUT OF A COUNTY SAYS IT'S NOT READY TO START. THEY CAN NOTIFY US AND THEY WILL GIVE THEM A DIFFERENT DATE. IF THEY HAVEN'T TRAINED UP THERE STOP THE CRANE UP. AND THE READY TO START THEN THEY WILL START NOT WITH HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF THESE POLICIES WE ARE TALKING TENDS. A DAY SORT OF THING. I WAS THOSE. I THOUGHT EVALUATION CONTINUES FROM OUR OUR RESEARCH CONTRACT WE WILL GET. WE WON'T NECESSARILY GET VALIDITY. WHAT WE WILL GET IS RELIABILITY ARE WE GETTING INTER RATER RELIABILITY THAT'S TESTIMONY? AREN'T I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT VERY PRELIMINARY DATA THAT WE'VE GOTTEN ALREADY BECAUSE IT'S SMALL BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR. IN THE FFA TEST IS CONSISTENT INTER RATER RELIABILITY I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE RELIABILITY FROM WHAT I CAN SEE YET. NOT LIKE. TOTALLY GET LEAVE MY SELF WHEN TO COME BACK IN A WEEK OR TWO THAT WILL. SORRY IF IT'S GOING THE DIRECTION WE'RE GONNA DO SOME DIFFERENT. BUT AS LONG SECURING RELIABILITY THEN THE QUESTION ABILITY STARTS TO BE AS THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE ALSO DOING SCR EVALUATIONS OF DOING IT WILL SAVE. ARE THEY DIVERGE. IF THEY'RE DIVERGING WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WE'VE GOT OF POLLITT BACK AND SEE WHERE WE ARE IF IT'S NOT DIVERGING. WE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO FEELING. FEELING THAT. IN TO IT THAT THIS IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE NO WE COMMITTED. THAT WE WOULD COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TWO YEARS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATES. TO REPORT ON. ADEQUACY OF BOTH THE AMOUNTS THAT WE HAD BUDGETED. AND THE. WHETHER KIDS ARE WHAT FAMILIES WERE WINDING UP GETTING BRIGHTER WHERE THEY NEED TO KIDS AND THEREFORE THEIR CAREGIVERS. SO WE WILL DO THAT THESE ARE I MEAN AS LUPUS IS ALSO TO SET THESE ARE INTERIM RATES IT'S AN INTERIM TOOL. BUT WOULD YOU START SOMEWHERE IF YOU DON'T START DON'T START IF YOU DON'T STOP WE. DON'T GET IT DONE. INDULGE ME IF YOU CAN THEN BROUGHT BECAUSE THIS IS APRIL ELEVENTH AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A START DATE OF MAY FIRST. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME IN TERMS OF NEXT STEPS FOR US. TO HAVE OUR STAFF BE BRIEFED AND TO MEET WITH YOU AS WELL AS TO DISCUSS WITH THE UC DAVIS RESEARCHERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE. LOC TOOL. SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FIRSTHAND WHAT CAN AND CANNOT. DELIVER BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. ABSOLUTELY I MEAN WE HAD A MEETING SCHEDULED LAST WEEK WHICH I CANCELED ON MY NOTE CAUSED A BIT OF A FALSE SIX WE HAD SO LITTLE DATA IN YET. THAT WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THREE IN ALL THREE CASES ARE SELECTED. ACT OF SEVENTEEN SOME. ALL WEEKS ARE EXPECT THAT IN. TWO WEEKS FROM NOW WE'LL BE REPUBLIC OF. FIFTY SIXTY WE WILL WE WILL LIKELY HAVE THEM. ON ALL OF THE EIGHTY CASES SCORED AT LEAST ONCE YEAH BOTH ONE RAIDER IN THAT. IN WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS AND LIKELY AT LEAST TWO RAIDERS FOR EACH OF THE EIGHTY CASE SO WE WERE BEGINNING TO SEIZE UP BUT AGAIN I I REALLY WANT TO BE. CAREFUL SIR THAT IT THAT WE DON'T. LATER I HAVE A FEELING THAT WE DIDN'T LIVE UP TO SOMETHING IN BRIEFING THE STAFF AT CENTER THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS SAYING. AUTUMN. WE'RE REALLY PUTTING IT OFF I MEAN WITWER BRIEFING SO THAT EVERYONE GETS A GROWING SENSE OF AWARENESS AS TO WHAT WE'RE DOING. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SOMETHING FROM THE DYESS IS A. OF FRUSTRATION FROM FEELING AS HAVE WE BEEN INCLUDED IN SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION SO THAT WE CAN GET TO THE SAME COMFORT LEVEL THAT IT APPEARS THAT YOU ARE AT. AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK IS AN ABILITY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS THIS MONTH. BEFORE ANYTHING IS IMPLEMENTED SO THAT WE CAN BETTER GET A SENSE OF. DIRECTIONS REGARDING THIS TOOL AND ALLEN. WOULD ASK AGAIN THAT WE BE ABLE TO MEET OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TO TO SPEND THE APPROPRIATE TIME THAT'S NECESSARY. TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S BEFORE US IN. IN TERMS OF. PLANNING FOR A START DATE OF JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN. WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO UNDERTAKE IS SIGNIFICANT AND. YET I BELIEVE WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT CONTINGENCIES. AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO IN. ADDITION TO THE SIX MAJOR REFORMS THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT. BUT IF THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY TO COME UP WITH CONTINGENCY PLAN JUST IN CASE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO. REALIZE THAT WHILE WE ASPIRE TO. THIS DREAM. THERE MIGHT NOT BE REALIZABLE BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THAT. IF I SAID WHAT DID MY MIND. WASN'T WORKING HAD CONTINUED IT OUT OBVIOUSLY NOT. LOSE MY CREDIBILITY ARM. HOWEVER I THINK ANY CONTINGENCIES WE LOOK AT HALF BAD INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES THAT WERE BUILT IN SO THAT WE DON'T WIND UP. CREATING PERVERSE INCENTIVES AT THE END OF THE DAY ARM. I'M I'M. A MEMBER OF READING ONCE THAT OF THE GENERAL EISENHOWER HAD PANS A. SPEECH TO GIVE IF THE INVASION HAD FAILED ALL SO GOOD I DON'T THINK ANYONE DOESN'T. AT ONE LEVEL SAY YES. THINGS MAY NOT. LINE UP THE WAY BE WANTING TO BUT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING INCENTIVES IN THE RIGHT PLACES. THAT PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED. TO BE DOING IT THAT THE WHATEVER THE INERTIAL. TENDENCIES ARE IN JUST THE GOVERNMENT I MEAN ON THIS I'VE REALLY. NOT CALLING ON ANYBODY PUT THERE ARE INERTIAL TENDENCIES THAT WE DON'T SORT OF. SLIPPED TO THE LOSE. ON THEM BECAUSE OUR OUR COUNTY SUB. THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORKING ON IT WITH A LOT OF PROJECTS ON THEIR PLATES. OB KEEPING OUR YOU KNOW OUR OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERS FOCUSED ON ON BOARD AMID EVER EVER EVERYBODY HAS OF THE THINGS. YES THEIR DATA TO YOUR QUESTIONS OPERABLE IT IS YES. THANK YOU UP THERE'S MUCH MORE FOR US TO DISCUSS ON THIS ISSUE BUT I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET TO ANY OTHER RESOLUTIONS BY THE END OF TODAY'S AREA. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. IF I CAN JUST I STARTED THE MEETING WITH THAT BUT I CAN JUST WANTED TO THANK BEN JOHNSON FOR YOUR WRITE UP ON THIS ISSUE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND. ALL THE FACETS AND WE CAN ONLY DO THAT WHEN YOU SPEND THE APPROPRIATE TIME SO THANK YOU FOR THE. NOW ONE ISSUE THREE. YEAH. NEXT. ON I THINK SO YEAH APARTMENT. FOR THE QUIRK OF. THAT'S GOOD. WE NEED. WILL BEGIN ON ISSUE THREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON FLIPPERS AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO THE ADVOCATES PROPOSAL. AUTUMN. MISTER CHAIR OUT THE ROUTE AND WENT CCR WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED THEY WENT INTO THE INTENT WAS. I AS YOU KNOW FOSTER PARENT RETENTION RECRUITMENT WAS ALREADY PART OF THE CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS AND SO WE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT WAS PART OF THE PROGRAM WE ALIGN TO TWENTY LEFT. HOWEVER BOTH WE AND THE COUNTIES FULLY REALIZE THAT IN ORDER TO. MAKE THIS WORK THERE REALLY HAS TO BE A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL OF. LIFT AND TURNS OFF ARM PARTICULARLY RETENTION SUPPORT AND THEN ALSO RECRUITMENT PUMP TO HAVE THE HOMES. BUT WE NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT THE LAST ITEM SO THE. IN THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION COLUMN THERE WAS HALF YOUR FUNDING STARTING. YEAR AND HALF AGO. OF THIS ENHANCED FUNDING THE CURRENT YEAR WAS BEING FULLY FUNDED BY THE STATE. AND THEN THE. ORIGINAL PLAN WHICH IS WHAT'S REFLECTED THE BUDGET IS HALF YEAR FUNDING IN THE. BUDGET HERE. ALL SO THAT IN TOTAL THERE WAS A SORT OF A TWO YEAR SURGE OF RESOURCE. ALL WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE. CONCERNS ABOUT MAY NEED TO CONTINUE BUT THAT'S WHAT'S. THE CURRENT BUDGET. THANK YOU SIR. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM MS HAMRICK. I'M MAY NAME IS JOYCE AND RIGHT TIME A FOSTER PARENT AND NOT COUNTY. ALSO A PRESIDENT THE ROMAN EMPIRE FUSS MURATSUCHI. WE'VE HAD A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED THIRTY KIDS THAT COME THROUGH OUR HOME IN THAT TIME. AND I'M NOT A PUBLIC SPEAKER. BUT I AM ALONG WITH A PASSION FOR OUR KIDS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HOW INSTRUMENTAL IF IT FOR SPENDING IS TO CONTINUE AND NOT HAVE IT LASSEN BUT THEY STAY AT THE RATE THAT IS RIGHT NOW. AND SOME OF THE ISSUES ASSEMBLY LONG RUBIO THAT YOU TRASK I THINK AND. I WAS BIGELOW TO THAT TOO AND. OUR RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS AND ISSUES THAT AWAY BEFORE CCR. THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN. A PROBLEM WITH THAT NOW IN THE STATE AND THE NATION ALSO. SO WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION AND CC ARE WE'VE HAD TO IDENTIFY RESOURCE FAMILIES AND A NONTRADITIONAL WAY FIFTH RESPONDING HAS HELPING USED TO IN OUR COUNTY FOR NEW AND TARGETED RECRUITMENT MATERIAL. WHICH ARE SOME THAT I HAVE HERE THAT ARE TARGETING AS FAR AS SPECIFIC GROUPS OF PEOPLE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS EMPTY NESTERS. WE USE. EVERY KIND OF PERSON GOING INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES SEE IF THEY CAN HOW. I DON'T COUNTY STAKEHOLDER INPUT WAS CRUCIAL IN BUILDING PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT COMES INTO IMPROVE RECRUITMENT. IDEAS CAME OUT OF Q. P. AYE MEETINGS I WORK GROUPS MENTORING WORK GROUPS AND SURVEYS AND OUT OF THOSE SERVICE MANY THINGS HAPPEN. I WON WITH THIS BIT RESPONDING WE DEVELOPED A CAREGIVER SUPPORT UNIT AS SOCIAL WORK RETIRED TO SOME TO SUPERVISE THE UNIT. THAT OVERSEAS ARE MENTORING PROGRAM IN CINEMA COUNTY. AND THEY ALSO SUPPORT RECRUITMENT RETENTION EFFORTS AN EMERGENCY FUND WAS ESTABLISHED TO BE USED FOR UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A FAMILY. YOU HAVE CHILDREN COMING YEAR HOME THINGS HAPPEN. AN EXAMPLE OUT OF THAT GROUP OF CHILDREN BROUGHT MITES INTO A HOME THEY HAD TO BE EVACUATED AND THE WHOLE HOUSE. ERADICATED THAT'S EXPENSIVE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PERSON'S HOME. ANA SO THOSE FUNDING THEY USE THAT THOSE MONIES TO HELP THAT FAMILY WHERE THEY HAD BLACK STAIN HAVE THAT HOME. NAM. CAR SEATS WHEN A NEW RESOURCE FAMILY CAN'T GET OUT WHEN THEY HAVE AN EMERGENCY PLACEMENT. WE'VE ALSO ESTABLISHED A FAMILY FINING COLLABORATION AND ALL COUNTY APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT WHERE WE SHARE TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND BRING THE COUNTY TOGETHER AS FAR AS FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES. RESEARCH FAMILIES CAN SHIP. ARE WE ARE WE TRAIN TOGETHER. FUNDING ALSO HELP SUPPORT SEND. RESOURCE FAMILIES TO THE KEEP THE I. CONFERENCE OUT OF STATE WHICH BRINGS YOU TOGETHER WITH OTHER CARE GIVERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS THAT YOU CAN WORK TOGETHER. AND LEARN THE DIFFERENCES IN HOW TO WORK TOGETHER WHICH HELPED SINK IN RETENTION AND OUR COMMUNITY. COM. SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT I CAN JUST GIVE YOU A FEW THAT ARE MENTORING PROGRAM WHICH IS USED CPAP FIFTH RESPONDS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WE. AVOID UNINTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCES BY AVOIDING LICENSING PROBLEMS WHEN YOU HAVE A MENTOR ON MENTOR IT WE HAVE A MENTOR ASSIGNED TO EVERY HOME AS THEY BECOME APPROVED FOR A YEAR AND THAT MENTOR WORKS WITH THE FAMILY. WE'RE ABLE TO. HOW FAMILIES GO THROUGH THAT GRIEF AND LOSS WHEN A CHILD'S MOOD THAT THEY REALLY WANTED TO KEEP MY CHILD TRANSITION TOM LATIMES THAT FAMILY WANTS ME FINISHED THEY WANT TO DO IT AGAIN IT'S HARD WHEN WE GIVE UP TILL THE WEE LA? WE HELP TALK THEM THROUGH NEXT UNIT JUST HELP SUPPORT THEM THROUGH THAT TOO. I'M. WE'VE HAD CHILDREN HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED THE CON THEIR MENTORS TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO HOW TO HELP THEM CAN YOU COME AND WATCH MY KIDS I CAN TAKE A SHOWER. ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO. I'M WE ARE REALLY EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH OUR MENTORING PROGRAM AND CINNAMON COUNTY ALSO TO BRIDGE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIRTH FAMILY. WERE ASKED TO WE ARE ALWAYS ON REUNIFICATION THAT'S WHAT WE DO BUT THA'S NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS. SO OUR MENTORS HELP BRIDGE THAT GAP TO WORK TOGETHER WITH BOTH THAT. BY A FAMILY AND THE CARE GIVER ON THEM A ONE OF THE MENTORS STATED THAT THE DAY TO DAY AVAILABILITY OF HAVING SOMEONE A CALLER A TEXT AWAY IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE. ALSO HAVING SOMEONE HELP AFTER HOURS AND DURING EMERGENCIES OFFERS FAMILY SECURITIES. I AND THAT SUPERVISOR THAT SOCIAL WORKER FOR RECRUITMENT RETENTION SAID ONLY NOT A FOSTER PARENT CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND AND SHARE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A CARE GIVER. I HAVE SOCIAL% WORKERS APPROACH ME ALMOST WEEKLY IF NOT MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED BY CONSIGNMENT TOUR. THROUGH AN AGENCY BUT AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING OR CAPACITY X. TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO ALL CARE GIVERS SO RIGHT NOW WE JUST YOU COUNTY APPROVED THOMAS. I'M BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR MARK. OTHER COUNTIES USE THEIR FUNDING FOR. ONE COUNTY HAS A ONE STOP LICENSING MODEL FOR OUR FAA YOU CAN GO THERE AND GET ALMOST EVERYTHING DONE IN ONE STOP INCLUDES DINNER. AND. I YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S IMPORTANT THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO THEY CAN GET IT DONE A LOT QUICKER THEN MARIN AND MARIPOSA COUNTIES HAVE FOSTER PARENT LIAISON THAT'S PAID FOR OUT OF THE FIFTH RESPONDING. TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND THOSE THAT FOSTER PARENTS WORK. WE ARE. WELL THE STATE IS ASKING RESOURCE FAMILIES TO BE FLEXIBLE TO BE OPEN TO TAKE CHILDREN THEY MAY NOT CONSIDER. TAKING INTO THEIR HOMES BEFORE I CAN AGES. IF FAMILIES ARE BEING ASKED TO DO THIS THEY MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO MAKE THE CHILDREN SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR HOME. THE PROGRAMSTHAT THE PAPERS MONEY SUPPORTS ARE CRUCIAL TO RECRUITING RETAINING THESE QUALITY CARE GIVERS FAR DESERVING CHILDREN. THE BEST THING WOULD BE RECRUITMENT OF THE RIGHT HOMES FOR OUR KIDS AND FOR THE CURRENT FAMILIES TO BE WELL SUPPORTED IN WHAT THEY DO. I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE PART OF THE COALITION IN SUPPORT OF CONTINUED PAPERS FUNDING MANY CHALLENGES COME ALONG WITH C. C. AREN'T RFA. WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT BUT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THE FULL FUNDING. PART OF OUR FAMILIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM AND YOU DID A GREAT JOB IN PUBLIC SPEAKING. THANKS CHOICE AND THIS IS CNN IF AND WITH CHILDREN NOW AND THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE I CAN SAY MEAN CHOICES AS PROVEN I THINK WHY THIS IS SUCH A VALUABLE PROGRAM. AND SO NEEDED IF WE TRULY WANT TO STEP KIDS DOWN OUT OF GROUP HOMES WE NEED CAREGIVERS WHO ARE COMMITTED AND DEDICATED IN THAT WERE SUPPORTING THE WAY THEY NEEDED TO BE SUPPORTED. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HAPPENING AGAIN IS AND THE DEPARTMENT IS REDUCING RESOURCES TO A PROGRAM BASED ON TIME LINES RATHER THAN REALLY STOPPING AND THINKING ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE CARE GIVERS AND THE FAMILIES. SO ASKING AGAIN TO SLOW DOWN TO RETHINK THIS CUT AND AND TO KEEP THE MONEY AT THE CURRENT LEVEL OF FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THE FAMILY STILL NEED IT AND WE'RE NOT AT A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE ENOUGH CARE GIVERS TOSTEP CHILDREN DOWN YET. IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR A CUT. AND WE'D ALSO LIKE TO ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE A FEW SMALL TWEAKS WE KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT PEPPERS NOW COUPLE YEARS AND. WE'D LIKE TO REQUIRE COUNTIES TO DEVELOP A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO ENSURE CARE GIVERS IN YOUTH ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO FAT PURSE PLANS. ON SO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING WHAT THEY NEED AND WE'RE LISTENING TO THEM ABOUT THAT. A TO REFINE THE FOCUS OF THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT BEST PRACTICES AS WE'VE SEEN THEM DEVELOP. AND ALSO TO ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH IMPROVED REPORTING OF HOW THE FUNDS WERE USED. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIOTT. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE.

WHAT I HAVE GAINED FROM BEING AND FOUGHT THE IT BOTHER THEM FAMILIES AND WORKING FOR THEM WE HAVE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS FOR KIDS? PROGRAMS THAT I HOLD DEAR TO MY HEART TODAY BECAUSE IT HAD I NOT. BEEN HIRED AT FATHER THEIR FAMILIES AND BEING THAT I AM A FILLED IN FORM INCARCERATED FOR ELEVEN YEARS I AM. PRETTY SURE THAT I WOULD END UP BACK IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. STOLE THE MAIN REASON WHY SUPPORT THIS BILL IS BECAUSE. BEING IN AMERICAN HA I FELT LIKE IF THE STAFF WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAINED. I WOULDN'T.

THE GARDEN PROJECT WHERE THE KIDS COME OUT THERE AND THEY LEARN HOW TO CULTIVATE AND THEY ARE GREETED WITH NOTHING ⋑ HAVE THE TRUMPCARE UNIT WHERE THE KIDS CAN COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS TALK ABOUT THEIR ISSUES.

HAD THESE KIDS HAVE THOSE PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW THEY WOULDN'T BE GOING TO JUVENILE HALL FOR THE LITTLE THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING I WOULD TO JUVENILE HALL FOR DISTURBING THE PEACE. YOU HAVE A KID THAT NGUYEN INTO AMERICAN HALL A VERY QUIET INTIMATE WITH ESPECIALLY THOUGHTS ABOUT HER BROTHER AND ALL THE THINGS GOING ON IN THE HOUSEHOLD. AND YOU CHOOSE TO.

BECAUSE I'M HERE SPEAKING OUT FOR THE KIDS WHO WERE THERE NOW WHO CAN'T SPEAK I AM THEIR VOICE SO I WILL LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO FEED HIS BILL BEING PASSED. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISS HOLMAN NEXT WHERE FRANKIE GOES MARK. THANK YOU CHAIR HIGH MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE MANY FRANK IT WAS MINE I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW.

FOSTER YOU DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM TO TREAT ALL CHILDREN THAT ARE ACCUSED OF LOW LEVEL OFFENSES FOSTER YOUTH LIKE SHEA APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR AGE AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON HEALTH AND WELL BEING. YOU KNOW SOME CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE BEGUN TO CREATE DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE FROM AND FORMER SERVICES TO VULNERABLE YOUTH POPULATIONS. YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE IMPACT THE COMMUNITY BOOK BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT BOTHERED HIM FAMILIES HAS ON THE LIVES OF FOSTER YOUTH AND OTHER VULNERABLE YOUTH. THIS REQUEST THIS REQUEST A. TODAY WILL ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES WERE TOO MANY FOSTER YOUTH ARE CROSSING OVER INTO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. A OPERATING COMMUNITIES ARE ARMED WHAT. BY FAR THIS REQUEST WILL ENSURE THAT. COMMUNITIES WERE FOUGHT MANY FOUGHT FOR YOU THE CROSSING OVER INTO THE JUVENILE SYSTEM AND WE'RE GROUP PALMS IN SHELTERS THAT OVER ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DEAL WITH YOU BEHAVIOR. WILL INSTEAD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A ROBUST NETWORK OF TROM INFORMED. CULTURALLY RELEVANT HEALTH BASED APPROACHES TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE OF THE VULNERABLE YOU'VE. UNDER THIS PLAN THE DEPARTMENT OF. SOCIAL SERVICES IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE BOARD OF TO INCOMMUNICADO ACTIONS ONE MINISTER A U. DIVERSION. AND DEVELOPMENT FUND TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FOSTER CARE STAFF. AND PROVIDE COMMUNITY BASED TRAUMA FORM SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOUTH PLACE TO CONGREGATE CARE. IN FACILITY THAT OVER RELY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DEAL WITH THESE YOUTH. FIRST. THOUGHT FOR EACH OF THESE THAT THREE YEARS SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OR SEVEN HAVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL FUND YOU DIVERSION DEVELOPMENT. AND WILL BE ALLOCATED COUNTIES WITH HIGH RATES OF CROSSOVER YOUTH USING A FORMULA. UNDER THIS PLAN COUNTIES MUST SUBMIT A YOUTH DEVELOPMENT DIVERSION PLAN. IDENTIFIER LEAD PUBLIC AGENCY. WHO LOCATIONS WITH THE GREATEST NEED? COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SERVICES TO BROUGH BE PROVIDED. AND YOU THINK WELL BEING OUTCOMES TO BE MEASURED. ADDITIONALLY PLANS MUST IDENTIFY BRAIDED OR MATCHING LOCAL COUNTY FUND SUCH AS AVAILABLE FUNDS PROPOSED FOR A PURPOSE FOR MENTAL HEALTH. AND YOU DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. UP TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE LEAD AGENCY FOR COORDINATION AND TRAINING. AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE YOUTH THAT VERSION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. THE LEAD AGENCY MUST PASS THROUGH NO LEFT OF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUNDS TO ONE OR MORE COMMUNITY BASED. SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES TO FOSTER YOUTH AT RISK. OF ARREST AND INCARCERATION. COMMUNITY BASED DIVERSIONARY SERVICES FUND IS PROGRAM INCLUDE MENTORING. EDUCATIONAL IN RICHMOND COLLEGE AND CAREER PREP. ARTS RECREATION CULTURAL AND ETHNIC STUDIES AS WELL AS CULTURALLY RELEVANT HEALING PRACTICES FELT AWARENESS AND HEALTH PROGRAMMING. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE A PROVEN EVIDENCE BASE AND OUR MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR DEALING WITH LOW LEVEL OFFENSIVE THEN IF THE PRACTICE OF ARREST AND INCARCERATION. OF THE CHILDREN INTERESTED IN OUR STATE CARE. SECOND THIS PLAN HOW THE TRAINING COMPONENT FOR FOSTER CARE STAFF AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ON ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT. TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES TO ENSURE THAT THEY EMPLOY EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS FOR VULNERABLE YOUTH IN LIEU OF ARREST INCARCERATIONS. FURTHER STAFF AND OFFICERS WILL BE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH AVAILABLE COMMUNITY BASED DIVERSIONARY SERVICES AND CAN MAKE REFERRALS WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER FOSTER YOUTH IN NEED OF SUPPORT. THIS PLAN ALSO MAKES FUN OF MAKES USE OF TITLE FOR E. FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS. I WHICH CAN COVER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL COSTS OF TRAINING FOSTER CARE STAFF AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. IN THIS EXAMPLE. THE ESTIMATED COST OF TRAINING. THE NEED FOR FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT A FOSTER CARE STAFF IF IF YOU FEEL AT EASE THAT WE ARE MAKING MORE THAN A HUNDRED CALLS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT PER YEARS TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND UNDER THIS PLAN WITH INVESTMENT OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS. IF THEY CAN RECEIVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AND FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS FOR THIS TRAINING. THIRD. THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WILL CONTRACT WITH THE RESEARCH FIRM TO STUDY THE PROGRAM OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD AND MEASURE REDUCTIONS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSES. CORE CASELOADS AND PROCESSING DAYS THAT YOU SPEND A DETENTION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DIVERT FOSTER YOUTH HEALTH AND WELL BEING INCLUDING COMMUNITY STABILITY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. REDUCING LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIVE TO YOU FOR LOW LEVEL OFFENSES WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS TO THE STATE AND PARTICIPATING LOCALITIES. FURTHERMORE IMPROVEMENT AND FOSTER YOUTH HEALTH AND WELL BEING ARE FAR MORE COST EFFECTIVE. THEN LIFELONG INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AS SUCH THIS PLANET BOTH SOCIALLY AND FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. BY REDUCING OUR OVER RELIANCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND POWER TIED IN COMMUNITY BASED TROMBONE FORM CARE FOR MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH CALIFORNIA CAN IMPROVE LIFE OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH BETTER UTILIZE SCARCE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES.

SOCIAL SERVICES AN APARTMENT OF. FINANCE THE LA OH. AND THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. EXTENDED OF FOSTER CARE BENEFITS ARE CRITICAL AS YOU TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD. THESE YOUTH FACE GREATER. CHALLENGES AND COMPLETING THEIR EDUCATION AND FINDING STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL ASK FOR ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT A NUMBER. OF OF THE YOUTH WHO CURRENTLY CANNOT ACCESS EXTENDED A FOSTER CARE WILL NOT BE LEFT OUT. I'M HERE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS SERVE A SUBPOENA. REPRESENTING THE A YOUTH JUSTICE OF FELLOW OF SOUTH BAY AREA LEGAL AIDS. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER YOUNG LADY WHO ALSO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY THEY WILL BOTH SELF INTRODUCE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS SABRINA FORTE I AM A STAFF ATTORNEY AT BAY AREA LEGAL AID AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CO SPONSORS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON BUDGET REQUEST ON EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. THIS IS A VERY NARROW TECHNICAL FIX OF THEM ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE BARRED FROM ACCESSING EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SERVICES DUE TO ADMINISTRATIVE HURDLES BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND BE LEGAL IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF STE FREE CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA TO RESIDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY. OUR YOUTH JUSTICE PROJECT SPECIALIZES IN DIRECT CIVIL REPRESENTATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE INCLUDING FOSTER YOUTH SURVIVORS A TRAFFIC IN AND DO YOU EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. MANY OF THE YOUTH JUSTICE PROJECTS CLIENTS ARE NON MINOR DEPENDENCE ALREADY RECEIVING EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SERVICES. THANKS TO THE PASSAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA FOSTERING CONNECTIONS TO SUCCESS ACT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO TURN EIGHTEEN AND FOSTER CARE ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ONGOING SUPPORT UP TO AGE TWENTY ONE TO BETTER PREPARE THEM FOR ADULTHOOD. THESE SUPPORTS INCLUDE. TRANSITIONAL INDEPENDENT LIVING CASE PLANS THAT ARE MODIFIED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE YOUTH AT SIX MONTH INTERVALS. MONTHLY MEETINGS WITH A CHILD WELFARE WORKER. FULL SCHEMATIC CAL UP TO AGE TWENTY SIX. LEGALLY MANDATED SCREENINGS AND ASSISTANCE WITH SSI FOR FOSTER YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES. PORT IN RESOLVING CONSUMER CREDIT ISSUES FOR FOSTER YOUTH WHO ARE VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT A COMMON PROBLEM. A CONTINUUM AND FINALLY A CONTINUUM OF PLACEMENT OPTIONS INCLUDING FOSTER FAMILY HOME SUPERVISED INDEPENDENT LIVING PLACEMENTS TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AND DISABILITY BATES CARE FACILITIES AS WELL AS ELIGIBILITY FOR. ELIGIBILITY FOR ONGOING TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AFTER EXITING CARE. THE SUPPORTS REPRESENT A CRITICAL SAFETY NET TO HELP. TRANSITION AGED YOUTH WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED ABUSE ABANDONMENT AND NEGLECT AVOID THE POOR LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY. HOWEVER OUR DEPENDENCY COURTS AND COURTS OF APPEAL HAVE IDENTIFIED A FEW SMALL AND SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REMAIN AN ELIGIBLE FOR THESE CRITICAL SUPPORTS. THE LA OWN ANALYSIS AND IDENTIFIES FOR SUBPOPULATIONS OF YOUTH WHO HAVE FACED TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO ANSWERING AND RE ENTERING FOSTER CARE. FOR EXAMPLE TIME SIMPLY RUNS OUT BEFORE THE JUVENILE COURT CAN MAKE DISPOSITIONAL FINDINGS OR THE TIMING OF CERTAIN BENEFITS PAYMENTS IS OUT OF SYNC WITH THE UTES PETITION TO REENTER FOSTER CARE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE ON. THESE BARRIERS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL OF THE YOUNG PERSON SEEKING TO ENTER OR REENTER FOSTER CARE AND WERE NEVER INTENDED TO BAR ELIGIBILITY TO EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. WE THINK THESE UNINTENDED TECHNICAL BARRIERS AFFECT JUST A SMALL NUMBER OF UNITS SMALLER EVEN THAN THE ALEJO ESTIMATE. BEFORE THESE YOUTH FAILURE TO REMOVE THESE BARRIERS HAS LED TO TRAGIC AND UNAVOIDABLE RESULTS INCLUDING AND ESPECIALLY HOMELESSNESS BUT ALSO HOSPITALIZATION AND INCARCERATION. ELIMINATING BARRIERS IDENTIFIED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL ENSURE THAT YOU THEY'RE ABLE TO ANSWER OR RE ENTER FOSTER CARE AND ENSURE THEIR SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD EVEN IN THE FACE OF TECHNICAL. OR BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS. THERE SEEMS TO BE THE THEME OF THE DAY. AHMADI AT THE YOUNG WOMAN SITTING ALONGSIDE ME WILL SHARE HER OWN STORY TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF EXTENDED FOSTER CARE IN A YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE. AND ALSO THE CHALLENGES THAT THREATEN TO BAR ACCESS TO SOME. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS REQUEST HE CAME HOME GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD.

WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIVE OPEN FOR NOW AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA START WITH MICHELLE EVANS IF THAT'S OKAY AND THEN GO ON TO CARRY FOR. AT GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE EVANS AND I AM A LAW STUDENT AT THE MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW PARTICIPATING IN THE LEGISLATIVE PUBLIC POLICY CLINIC. I AM AT THE SCHOOL I AM ALSO A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE BEEN A SOCIAL WORKER ACTUALLY FOR CLOSE TO TWENTY YEARS AND HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND WORKED WITH YOUTH AND FOSTER CARE AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SETTINGS. AT THIS PROPOSAL CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF OUR CONCERN THAT A LOT OF US TO TALK ABOUT TODAY THE TRAUMA THAT CHILDREN EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES. AND THEN I'M GOING TRAUMA THEY EXPERIENCED WHEN THEY DON'T EXPERIENCE. STABILITY WITHIN THE SYSTEM WHEN THEY'RE MOVE FROM THAT INITIAL HOME THEIR PLACED INTO A GROUP HOME TO RESIDENTIAL. TO ANOTHER POLICEMAN AND WE THIS LACK OF STABILITY Y. LANCAIR COMPLICATES THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE CHILD CAME INTO CARE WAITED MAKING IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE CHILD TO EVER FIND PERMANENCY. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT A CHILD IS IN CRISIS THAT DAY BUT THEY'RE PLACED IN A FOSTER HOME. WE NEED TO NOT WAIT FOR A CRISIS TO MANIFEST ITSELF IN THEIR NEW HOME BEFORE OF WE MOBILIZE SUFFICIENT TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILY. WHO HAS NOW JOINED TO THE CRISIS OF THE CHILD? WE NEED TO HELP THE FAMILY AND CHILD THROUGH THE TRANSITION OF PLACEMENT TO HELP STABILIZE AND PRESERVE THE POLICEMAN. FROM DAY ONE AND HELP THE CHILD TO HEAL AND NOT CAUSE FURTHER TRAUMA. WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS BY PROVIDING TRAUMA INFORMED COACHING TO RESOURCE FAMILIES AT THE OUTSET OF PLACEMENT. WHEN THE CHILD FIRST ENTERS THE HOME AND CARRY WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THOSE DETAILS. WITH A TRAUMA INFORMED PLAN FOR SUCCESS CREATED WITH FAMILIES AND COACHES FROM DAY ONE OF THE PLACEMENT WITH ONGOING SUPPORT THROUGH OUT THE PLACEMENT WITH THE COACH AVAILABLE. AND IF A CRISIS DOES ARRIVE HOPEFULLY WERE PREVENTING THAT FROM HAPPENING BUT TO HAVE THEM WHEN THEY ARE TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM. WILL HELP FURTHER THE GOALS OF THE CCR AND EVERY CHILD TO LIVE IN A STABLE AND NURTURING HOME. WITHOUT A PLACEMENT JAMES AND LESS THE MOVE IS TO THEIR HOME IS ALSO HELP IMPROVE RESOURCE FAMILY SATISFACTION AND RETENTION FOUND A SATISFYING PROCESS RESOURCE FAMILIES TO NOT HAVE SUCCESS WITH A CHILD THAT'S NOT WHEN THEY FIND OUT TO BE FOSTER CARE. IN MY OPINION PROVIDING THIS LEVEL OF TRAUMA AND FORMED COACHING SUPPORTER. TO FAMILIES AT THE OUTSET OF PLACEMENT IS. ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO THE ONGOING SUCCESS FOR THE OUTCOMES OF THE CCR. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU INCLUDE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEAN SHINES BUDGET REQUEST AND THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FIGURE BECAME. MISS FOURTH YES THANK YOU I AM MY NAME IS CARRIE FOR EARTH AND ALONG WITH MICHELLE I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THAT. LEGISLATION PUBLIC POLICY CLINIC AT MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW. AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE INCLUDE FOUR POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A TWO YEAR RESOURCE FAMILY. COACHING PILOT PROJECT IN THREE TO FIVE COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. COACHING SERVICES PROVIDED TO RESOURCE FAMILIES AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE PLACEMENT WILL GIVE MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT TO HELP PREVENT. CRISES BY DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR SUCCESS FROM THE BEGINNING PROVIDE RAPID SUPPORT. WHEN PROBLEMS DO ARISE AND WILL PREVENT THE NEED FOR SEVEN DAY NOTICES AND EMERGENCY REMOVALS. COACHING FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF LEARNING FROM TRAINING RECEIVED BY RESOURCE FAMILIES INTO PRACTICE IN THEIR HOMES. THE PILOT WILL ALLOW TWENTY QUALIFIED WORKERS TO BE TRAINED AS COACHES AND PROVIDE. DESIGNATED SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY TO RESOURCE FAMILIES. TO IMPROVE FOSTER PARENT RETENTION AND SUPPORT. IMPROVE STABILITY IN PERMANENCY FOR FOSTER YOU. AND PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AT THE END OF THE PILOT TO DETAIL THE OUTCOMES AT IMPROVING FOSTER PARENT RETENTION AND PLACEMENT STABILITY. WORKERS ASSIGNED AS DESIGNATED COACHES TO RESOURCE FAMILIES WILL HAVE THE PRIMARY ROLE TO COACH AND ASSIST RESOURCE FAMILIES WITH BONDING AN ATTACHMENT. BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES. WORKING WITH BIOLOGICAL FAMILIES AND EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION AND CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU INCLUDE THIS REQUEST FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN IN THE BUDGET. THANK YOU MA'AM. DOCTOR LIKELY. THE ONLY QUESTION I THINK IT HAPPENS TO CHAIR IS THIS MAY BE A BIT DUPLICATIVE IF THERE IS IN FACT THE EXTENSION OF FLIPPERS FUNDING. AUGMENT THIS SORT OF COVERS THE SAME AREA BUT. HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO. BUT UNTIL THERE'S A DECISION ON THE ONE IT'S HARD TO KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER. ANDERSON. BERMAN TO FINANCE A LEO. JUST BASED FORMING OF FINANCE AND AND JUST TO REITERATE THE YEAR. DIRECTORS AND I'M COMMENTS. THAT HIS ACTION MAY BE DUPLICATIVE OUT SOME SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR FAA I'M OR EVEN THROUGH THE. THE FIGURES FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDE ITS AT THIS TIME WOULD BE OPPOSED. TO THAT PROPOSAL FROM ACTIONS TAKEN HOWEVER THAT WE HAVE BEEN. HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS. AYE AND SPONSORS TO. PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS MOMENT FORWARD TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX. SEEN ON A BRING IT UP THE DYESS AND I WAS GONNA ASK A QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED AT THE COUNTY AND THAT? IT SEEMS THAT THAT'S BEEN ANSWERED. IN THAT AT SOME POINT THERE MAY BE DUPLICATIVE SERVICES AND. WELL I WOULD CLICK TO TO SORT OF CALM MADNESS HAMMERSMITH WHEN SHE WAS TESTIFYING ON THE FOR PRINCE THING WAS SORT OF DESCRIBING SOME MENTORING AND COACHING SORT OF ACTIVITIES SO THAT THEIR OWNERS NELSON. SUGGEST I DEPENDING ON WHAT ACTIONS YOU TAKE LATER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. THEY MIGHT WERE POINT TO THIS SORT OF ACTIVITY IS A PARTICULAR PRIORITY. ON BUT. AGAIN I DON'T SAY THAT TO. RAIN ON THE IDEA OF ITS IMPORTANCE. WITH THAT IN THE FOR THE PLANT BUT. AS I SAY I AND I KNOW THERE THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRAM I MEAN. IT IS TO PLUG HIS SPLIT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IT DOES CUT SOME OF THE FUNDING SO MR MAIENSCHEIN PROPOSAL. YOU SAID FUNDING THEIR INDENTURES THAT IT DOES GO THROUGH SAID ACTUALLY YOU KNOW SOMETHING BETTER TO LOOK AT AS WE GO INTO MAY REVISE. TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING IS INDEED THERE. SO. WITHOUT I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN AFTER. I COULD ASK MR ROSE TO LEAD OFF AND WE'RE JOINED BY DAVE MCDOWELL DUE TO THE HOUR OF TIME IMAGES ASKING YOU BE BRIEF WITH THE PROPOSAL IN. GREG ROSE FOR A DEADLY DIRECTOR FOR CHILDREN FAMILY SERVICES OF THE DEPARTMENT I WILL BE BRIEF I'LL JUST ASK DAVE TO A STEP THROUGH THAT THE ACTUAL. BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THANK YOU.

OUR IN DEVELOPING IMPROVE COORDINATION FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE NEED FOR THIS WAS HAD DETERMINED THROUGH OUR RECENT CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REVIEW THAT WAS COMPLETED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.

JUSTIN GREATEST PROPONENTS BELIEVE SUPPORT OF THEIR THAT DEPARTMENT PROPOSAL. HIM WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT ON THE SECOND PROPOSAL SIR. THIS PROPOSAL WE'RE ASKING FOR SEVEN HERE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO CONTINUES SIX POSITIONS TO DO INSPECTIONS ON THAT GROUP COMES PART THAT HAVE HIGH USAGE OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS.

LA OPEN JOHNSON OUT NO ISSUES WITH THIS PEACEKEEPING. JUST PRAISE FROM FINANCE AGAIN JUSTIN FULL SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN AT THIS TIME. SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE A HOW ARE YOU? IF YOU'RE STARTING THINK THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND ON THE AGENDA IF I CAN HAVE YOU FOCUS ON THE QUESTIONS ON PAGE FIFTY ONE. I WOULD BE APPRECIATED SIR THANK YOU. SO THE FIRST QUESTION HAS A DEPARTMENTS IN IMPACT ON THE COMPLAIN BACKLOG FROM THE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND RESOURCES. YES WE HAVE. THE COMPLAINTS WE'VE COMPLETED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. FIRST WE RECEIVED THIRTEEN POSITIONS AND FISCAL YEAR. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO AND TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG. SO SINCE THAT TIME OUR COMPLAINTS OF INCREASED INCREMENTALLY COULDN'T YOU'VE GOTTA OF. LIST OF OUR. A SUMMARY OF OUR WORK FLOW THAT WE PASSED OUT THAT DOESN'T HAVE OUR COMPLAINT WORKLOAD BUT IT IS IN THE AGENDA. BUT OUR COMPLAINTS BEEN INCREASING EACH YEAR SO WITH THOSE POSITIONS WE RECEIVE WEAPON ABLE TO COMPLETE KEEP OUR COMPLAINTS. COMPLETE IN AS MANY AS WE BEEN RECEIVING SO OUR BACKLOG HAS BEEN. THOSE COMPLAINTS OPEN OVER NINETY DAYS HAVE BEEN TRENDING DOWNWARD BUT WE HAVEN'T YOU KNOW AYE THREAT WE HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE THE ENTIRE BACKLOG BUT THEY HAVE WE HAVE BEEN. REDUCING THE NUMBERS THAT ARE OVER NINETY DAYS. SO AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE JUST BRIEF SUMMARY OF OUR VISITS WE'VE DONE OVER EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND VISITS OF COMPLAINTS CASE MANAGEMENT INSPECTIONS AND FACILITY INSPECTIONS AND I'M LICENSE SO. WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SOME LICENSE PROGRAM ALISON DO THE INSPECTIONS SO. TRYING TO PRIORITIZE A WORKLOAD BETWEEN ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AND THE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS. ANY QUESTIONS. I DO FROM. ARE WE MEETING THE INSPECTION FREQUENCY STANDARDS AS OUTLINED IN STATE LAW AND THAT THAT IS NUMBER TWO SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET OUR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS SO. AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR WE ARE FREQUENCY IS INCREASED FROM FIVE YEARS TO THREE YEARS AND WE'VE WE'VE. MADE APPROXIMATELY NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF OUR AND OF OUR THREE YEAR INSPECTIONS BUT WASN'T FOR THE FIRES IN THE. THE OROVILLE DAM WE WOULD'VE MADE A HUNDRED PERCENT. WHAT WE CURRENTLY DOING WITH THE BACKLOG IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE REACHED THE? AND I'M APPROPRIATE AMOUNT BUT. HOW WILL THE TOOL AND DEVELOPMENT WORK? WILMINGTON PHONES. THE TOOL IS THE HASN'T WASN'T DEVELOPED FOR AND FOR THE BACKLOG ACTUALLY BUT. DID THE BACKLOG IT'S JUST THE INCREASED COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE HAVE BURLY HAMPERED US FROM. FROM PRODUCING THE BACKLOG TO WHAT WE EXPECTED WE WOULD HAVE DONE. THE COMPLAINTS EACH YEAR WE DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE. WITH THE FACILITIES HAVE TO POST OUR EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER FOR COMPLAINTS. WE'VE GOT A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED HOTLINE. SO WE'VE GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION FOR PEOPLE TO CALL. SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT SPIKE THEIR COMPLAINTS WERE WERE HOPING THAT ONCE WE GET TO ANNUAL INSPECTIONS FOR ADULT SENIOR CARE THAT OUR COMPLAINTS WILL COME DOWN. BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHOSE. pTHOUGH IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG WERE TRYING. WE LINE OR WE'VE GOT. TASK FORCE WE'VE HIRED RETIRED ANNUITANTS WE'VE GOT TASK FORCE TRYING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WE CAN HAVE TEAMS THAT GO OUT WERE WERE BUNDLING OUR COMPLAINT WITH OUR ANNUAL INSPECTIONS IF THEY'VE GOT COMPLAINTS. WILL GO OUT TO THE COMPLAINTS WE PRIORITIZE OUR COMPLAINTS SO BASICALLY THE BACKLOG IS IS MAINLY LIKE. PRIORITY THREES AND FOURS THEY'RE NOT LIKE HIGH RISK. PRIORITY ONES AND TWOS WE'VE WE IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS THOSE. AS WE RECEIVE THEM. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OLEO ANY COMMENTS ON THE ISSUE EIGHT. SEEING NON PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE EIGHT. SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS AND GIVE ME JUST ONE SECOND MAYBE IT'S A ON A THEME FOR THE DAY BUT I WAS HOPING YOU COULD DESCRIBE THE NEW TOOL A LITTLE BIT. AS WELL THERE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS TO. SO THE TOLL WHERE DEVELOPED. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS WELL IT'S BEEN SINCE THE RECESSION THERE THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOP A TOOL CALLED THE KEY INDICATOR TOOL WHICH IS AN ABBREVIATED TOLL. THERE WAS AS YOU I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THEY HAD THE FURLOUGHS IN THE FREEZER SO WAS AN ABBREVIATED TOOL TO BE ABLE TO DO AS MANY INSPECTIONS AS THE DEPARTMENT COULD DO. ON AS WE'VE BEEN FINDING OVER TIME. THE TOOL DIDN'T IDENTIFY SOME AREAS OF OF NON COMPLIANCE THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE MORE PRODUCTIVE TOOK TO LET US KNOW HAD A TIME WHERE WE COULD. START. HELPING FACILITIES BEFORE THEY GOT TO THE POINT OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE TO SHUT THEM DOWN. SO THIS NEW TOOL IS DEVELOPED BY. ACTUALLY THE ARTICLES IN THE REGULATIONS SO WOULD BE ON. OPERATIONS STAFFING MEDICATIONS PHYSICAL PLANT. PERSONAL RECORDS SO IT'S IT'S DEVELOP SO YOU GET A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREE LOOK AT PULSE OF THE FACILITY THE HELP OF THE FACILITY AND SO. IT'S DEVELOPED IN A WAY THAT CAN BE USED AS A SELF ASSESSMENT TOOL FOR THE PROVIDERS SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN. THIS IS WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. IT IT'S IT'S PRETTY AND OUT THAT'S GOT A SPECIALTY TOOL BEHIND EACH OF THOSE AREAS SO IF WE FIND AREA AN ISSUE WITH MEDICATIONS. IT'S GOT A SPECIALTY TOOL THAT JUST DIVES DEEP IN THAT AREA SO THAT WE CAN REALLY FIND WHATSOEVER BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY'RE HAVING ISSUES. ON THE TOOLS BEFORE WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE TOOL IN THE PAST. SO THIS IS IT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL IS GONNA BE A PREVENTATIVE TOOL FOR THE PROVIDERS THAT THEY CAN USE THIS TRAINING AROUND STAFF IN IT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT. IT'S GONNA BE A TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE WE'VE MET WITH THEM THEY'VE GOT THE TOOL RIGHT NOW WE'RE LETTING THEM. GET FAMILIAR WITH IT FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE WE START OUR PILOT WHICH WILL BE IN JULY. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE EIGHT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE. MISTER CHAIR PAT LEERY I'M TO KEPT DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I ACTUALLY LIKE TO DO THE SECOND VCP FIRST YEAR WHICH IS THE PRIVATE ALTERNATIVE BOARDING SCHOOLS. THIS IS ABOUT THE RESULTS OF A BILL PASSED BY SENATOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT WITH MY SENATOR LARA TWO YEARS AGO. THAT REQUIRES US TO NOW LICENSE PRIVATE THERAPEUTIC BOARDING SCHOOLS AND WILDERNESS CAMPS IT'S AN ENTIRELY NEW CATEGORY FOR US. THESE ARE FACILITIES THAT HOLD THEMSELVES OUT AS BEING THERAPEUTIC IN NATURE IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF MILIEU THAT ACTUALLY. DEALS WITH. TROUBLED TEENS HIS THEY'VE OFTEN BEEN BEEN. CHARACTERIZED. THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION WHEN THAT BILL WENT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT INAPPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES AT THESE. FACILITIES AND THE FACT THAT THEY WEREN'T LICENSE THEY WEREN'T USING. LICENSED STAFF I'M OR CERTIFIED STAFF IN THE PROCESS. AND SO. IT BITS THESE TWO NEW CATEGORIES WHICH ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAT SOMEHOW OF REGULAR FACILITIES OTHERS ARE LITERALLY OUT IN THE WOODS OR THE MOUNTAINS. REQUIRES US TO CREATE A NEW LICENSING. SCHEMA FOR THAT. THIS PROPOSAL GIVES US TWELVE PERHAPS STAFF IN ORDER TO DO THAT. WHICH IS ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS. ALLOWS US TO DO WERE POINTED TO USE OUR GROUP HOME REGULATIONS AS THE BASIS ARE NOT GONNA WRITE IT FROM SCRATCH WE'RE GONNA START WITH THAT. AND THEN ADD ON TO THAT AS NECESSARY. THESE ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT IN THAT THESE ARE NOT. CURRENTLY OPERATING FACILITIES WHO ARE COMING FORWARD SAYING WE'D LIKE TO BE LICENSED WE'D LIKE TO HAVE LICENSURE FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE. WE MAY HAVE TO DO A LOT OF INVESTIGATION TO DISCOVER WHERE THESE FACILITIES ACTUALLY ARE. AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF INVESTIGATION AND. SEARCHING OUT BOTH INTERNET CHAT ROOMS. TO FIND WHERE THESE THESE FACILITIES MAIN FACT BE OPERATING WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEGAL ACTIVITY. BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR RELIGIOUS. CONCERNS SOME. THESE FACILITIES IN THE PAST HAVE INDICATED THEY WERE OPERATING AS A FAITH BASED. INSTITUTION WHICH WE DON'T REGULATE. I HAVE AND SO FINING THE DISTINCTION A DIFFERENCE THERE. IS GONNA TAKE SOME LEGAL WORK AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO THIS IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF A POPULATION THAT WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY REAL INDICATION OF WHAT THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF IT WOULD BE. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED WE NEED TO DO CONSIDERABLE WORK IN ORDER TO GET STARTED ON IT. FROM WE USE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S LIST OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS. AS A SET UP AS A STARTING POINT TO SEE HOW MANY MIGHT FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY. BUT UNTIL WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THIS WE WON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY THESE FACILITIES ARE GONNA COME UNDER OUR REGULATION. THANK YOU MA'AM. NEXT PCB OKAY THE NEXT ONE IS ACTUALLY ON. IT IT'S FROM OUR ADMINISTRATION DIVISION AND ITS FOR DISASTER SERVICES PROGRAM LAST YEAR THE. IMMEDIATE EVACUATION OF THE AREA AROUND THE OROVILLE DAM. AND LATER FOLLOWED BY THE OCTOBER FIRES AND MUD SLIDES. GAVE US PAUSE THE DEPARTMENT IS THE SINGLE STATE AGENCY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR MASS KAREN SHELTER IN DISASTERS WE'RE THE ONES WHO WORK WITH THE RED CROSS AND LOCAL AND COUNTY SOME LOCAL PROVIDERS TO STAND UP SHELTERS. AND TO SHELTER ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE WE RECOGNIZE WE HAD SOME SERIOUS GAPS THAT WE NEEDED TO FILL IN. IN ORDER TO DO THE BEST JOB THAT WE CAN WE'VE WE HAVE THERE BEEN OVER FIVE HUNDRED SHELTERS THAT HAVE OPERATED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IT HAS ONLY INCREASED AND WE DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S GOING TO GO DOWN. THESE STAFF WILL ALLOW US TO NOT ONLY HAVE MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK. DURING A DISASTER BUT WE BOTH. ARE OUT IN THE FIELD ACTUALLY WORKING IN SHELTERS AND WITH LOCAL WANT EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTERS WHERE ALSO STOPPING THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FACILITATING WHATEVER THE SHELTERS MIGHT MEAN BE A BAD SPIRIT STAFF. HOT MEALS. ADA COMPLIANT SHOWERS WHATEVER THEY NEED WE HEAR THE ONCE HELPING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT OCCURS. IT IN IN TIMES OF NOT DISASTER WHEN WE ARE NOT HAVING. THOSE KIND OF. ACTIVITIES GOING ON WE'LL BE OUT WORKING WITHIN THE REGIONS IN THE STATE WHAT THE LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. TO DEVELOP DISASTER PLANS. SO THAT WHEN A DISASTER OCCURS EVERYONE. IS FAMILIAR WITH EVERYONE EVERYONE'S ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE QUEER EVERYONE SCHOOL LINES OF COMMUNICATION ARE VERY ESTABLISHED AND FILL. IN THE CINEMA AND NAPA FIRES IN PARTICULAR THIS LAST FALL THAT WAS REALLY REALLY HELPFUL ON THE GROUND AND AND THE FOR THE FOLKS THERE. THEY ALREADY HAD EVERYBODY CELL PHONE NUMBERS WHEN THEY NEEDED THINGS HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO GET IT IT REALLY FACILITATED HELPING TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT WERE NECESSARY. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A LIVE. I'M MORE IN THE PROCESS AND HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THESE TWO PROPOSALS AND REYES NO SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS I WOULD NOTE FOR THE FIRST BZP THAT WE HEARD REGARDING THE PRIVATE ALTERNATIVE BOARDING SCHOOLS AN OUTDOOR PROGRAM OVERSIGHT AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES THE SCOPE OF. WORK ON THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PROVIDING LIMITED TERM RESOURCES THAT WOULD THEN REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK ONCE WE HAVE A BETTER. AND SENSE OF WHAT THE ASSOCIATED WORKLOAD IS WHAT DO YOU WHAT WITH THIS PARTICULAR REQUEST AND THEN RIGHT SITES FROM THERE. JUST INTEREST BERMAN A FINANCE AND LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT OF BOTH PROPOSALS AND JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT. THE. THAT PREVAILED TURNING BOARDING SCHOOLS BCP'S.

I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. YEAH THAT WITH OTHER INDIAN HEALTH CLINICS IN OUR IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE ALL RULE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE TRIES BUT THERE'S NO TRIBES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY. WE'RE WAY OUT THERE IN THE HILLS. SO WERE WAY IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. AND THAT'S A LOT OF TIME. TO TO. GO THERE TO TAKE CARE ONE PERSON. WHERE IT AND AND BUT BUT DO IT? SO. WE WE HAVE OUR. LOT OF WORK TO DO YET. AND. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER MARTINEZ. NEXTBUS KRESKIN. GOOD EVENING UP MY NAME IS VANESSA YET PRESCIENT THEM WITH THE CALIFORNIA RULE INDIAN HEALTH BOARD. I'M A CORPORATE IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE THE CALIFORNIA RULE IN THE HEALTH BOARD IS SANCTIONED BY FORTY FOUR CALIFORNIA TRIBES. TO OPERATE UNDER THE INDIAN SELF DETERMINATION ACT AS THE TRIBAL ORGANIZATION. OUR MEMBERSHIP CONSISTS OF FOURTEEN TRIBAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT SERVE FORTY EIGHT FORTY FOUR TRIBES. WE HAVE ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST WITH THE AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKA NATIVE PEOPLE STATEWIDE. AND HAVE AN EXTENSIVE HISTORY OF PROVIDING CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE TIGHTEN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TRIBAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND TRIBES WHERE COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES THAT WILL ELEVATE THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL CONSISTENT CONDITIONS. OF THE INDIAN PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THE IN IT HEALTH CLINIC PROGRAM WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WITH CAL WORK FUNDS PARTIALLY REIMBURSES FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS. AND THIRTY FIVE INDIAN HEALTH CLINICS IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. TOGETHER THEY COVER TERRITORY ALL THE WAY FROM THE ORGAN BORDER IN Y. RICA. DOWN THE CALIFORNIA COAST THROUGH THE SIERRAS AND ALPINE IN YOUR COUNTIES TO SAN DIEGO IN WINTER HAVEN. THE PROGRAM ASSISTS WITH MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT OF AMERICAN INDIAN INDIVIDUALS AND THE CAL WORKS OR TRAVEL TOWN OF PROGRAM. TO DEVELOP PERSONAL PLANS THAT COMPLY WITH WELFARE TO WORK REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN AND SUSTAIN EMPLOYMENT. AT A MAXIMUM GRANT AWARD OF JUST OVER FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PER CLINIC IT REQUIRES A FIVE YEAR IMHO YOU. AND IS DYING AND IS DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE COSTS OF PERSONNEL SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES TRANSPORTATION COSTS THAT DOCTOR ARE MISTER MARTINEZ MENTION. TO DRIVE PATIENTS TO APPOINTMENTS FOR TREATMENTS INTO COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENTS OVER RULED DISTANCES AND ALSO REFERRAL APPOINTMENTS TO INCENTIVE TREATMENT INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL SERVICES. AFTER THE RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE HIGHLY VALUED SIX POINT FOUR MILLION AND IN HEALTH PROGRAM UNDER THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WAS STRUCK DOWN BY THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE BEEN ONLY MINIMAL CONSULTATION FUNCTIONS AS A RESULT THE CAL WORKS FUNDED INDIAN HEALTH CLINIC PROGRAM. IS THE ONLY BE ABLE HEALTH PROGRAM THAT REMAINS IN THE STATE AND IS SPECIFICALLY TAILORED FOR AMERICAN INDIANS AND PROVIDES COURTROOM APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND TRADITIONAL HEALING PRACTICES. OUR ORGANIZATION TRIBES AND INDIAN HEALTH CLINICS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN INCREASING THIS BUDGET LINE ITEM. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE HIGH SUBSTANCE USE RATES IN THE I OP WOOD EPUB EPIDEMIC THAT IS DEVASTATING THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. AND RECENTLY WITH THE CLARITY NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THE OPEN ROAD EPIDEMIC IS HAS PARTICULARLY SEVERE AND CALIFORNIA TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. AMONG CALIFORNIA INDIANS FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE BURDEN OF OPIOID DEATHS WAS HIGHEST AMONG THE FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FOUR YEAR AGE GROUP. WHICH WAS TEN POINT TWO PERCENT COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE OF FOUR POINT NINE. WHICH IS MORE THAN DOUBLE. WE ARE SEEKING A REASONABLE INCREASE OF TWO POINT ONE FIVE MILLION AND SUCH AUGMENTATION WOULD TRANSLATE TO ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PER CLINIC BASED ON THIRTY SIX INDIAN HEALTH CLINICS. THIS AUGMENTATION WOULD ALLOW THESE CLINICS TO COVER THE COSTS OF. ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITION WITH BENEFITS AND THIS WOULD GREATLY HELP ADDRESS THE INCREASING CASELOAD CARRIED BY DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELLORS SUCH AS MISTER MARTINEZ. ORCHID ALSO FREE OF FLEXIBILITY FOR EACH CLICK HAS BEEN MORE ON CASE WORKER SERVICES FOR OPIATE USE MANAGEMENT OR GROUP THERAPY SESSIONS. SUPPORTED THIS BUDGET ACTION WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP PROPER FILLING IN A POOR AND STATE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE AND OTHER SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA INDIANS.
