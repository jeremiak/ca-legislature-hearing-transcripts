00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:21.144
CONCERN FOR THE RECORD- I WANNA

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:22.846
BE CLEAR WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:23.947
THE THEORY IF A FARMER WANTS TO

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:25.982
MAKE A DECISION TO TRANSITION TO

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:27.217
ORGANIC WE WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:29.085
OF IT BECAUSE FOR EXACTLY THE

00:51:29.152 --> 00:51:30.053
REASONS THE WITNESSES MENTIONED

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.054
IT'S TOUGH TO BE ORGANIC. I'M

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:32.756
SORRY ONE OF PROVIDE THAT

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:33.990
SUPPORT WHERE WE CAN AND I THINK

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:36.026
THE STATE CAN PLAY AN ACTIVE

00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:37.561
ROLE IN THAT. THE CONCERN IS

00:51:37.627 --> 00:51:38.628
REALLY TWO FOLD ONE ON

00:51:38.695 --> 00:51:39.162
PROGRAMMATIC FUNCTIONS OR

00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:40.664
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:44.067
AND THE SECOND IS ON PRESIDENT-

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:45.135
TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE PROPOSES

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:46.403
TO PLACE THE PROGRAM FOR

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:47.103
TRANSITION TO ORGANIC IN THE

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.738
FORMER EQUITY OFFICE OR WITH THE

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:50.974
FARMER EQUITY ADVISER-

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:52.509
UNDERSTANDABLY. THAT MIGHT BE

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:53.877
THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT FOR

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:54.911
SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:56.613
AND RANCHERS BUT WE DO FEEL AS

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.914
THOUGH IT HAS A BETTER HOME AND

00:51:57.981 --> 00:51:59.749
EITHER THE STATE ORGANIC

00:51:59.816 --> 00:52:00.784
PROGRAM- WHERE IT RELLY COVERS

00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:02.319
THE PANOPLY OF OPTIONS AROUND

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:02.786
ORGANIC CERTIFICATION

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:04.754
REGISTRATIONS. OR THE OFFICE OF

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.022
ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING INNOVATION

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:08.058
WHICH THIS LEGISLATURE JUST GAVE

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:09.459
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO LAST

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.962
YEAR TO TRANSITION TO ORGANIC. I

00:52:12.028 --> 00:52:14.364
AND SO WE FEEL AS THOUGH. THOSE

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:16.766
TWO PLACES ARE BUT- FOR PROGRAM

00:52:16.833 --> 00:52:18.568
LIKE THIS WITH. INCOMES WITH THE

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.537
EQUITY OFFICER. RATHER CONCERN

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:22.305
IS ONE OF PRESIDENT- WINS

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:23.573
AGUIAR-CURRY PASSED THE FARM

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.509
EQUITY ACT IN TWO THOUSAND

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:27.110
SEVENTEEN. OUR UNDERSTANDING WAS

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:28.011
THAT THE AT THE OFFICE WAS

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:29.179
RESPONSIBLE FOR EMBEDDING THE

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:30.547
PRINCIPLES OF DIVERSITY EQUITY

00:52:30.614 --> 00:52:32.382
INCLUSION AT THE PROGRAMMATIC

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:34.050
GRASSROOTS LEVEL. THAT WE EACH

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:35.986
PROGRAMS EQUITY COMPONENTS TAKEN

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:38.522
TO IT- WITH THAT'S APTLY HAPPEN

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:41.157
IT'S HARD WORK. TENSION ALL

00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:45.795
WORK- ARE CONCERNED. EIGHTY

00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:46.930
NINE. BUT IT MIGHT THE MESSAGE.

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.865
ABSOLUTELY ON AND- THE- THE

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:49.799
EITHER THAT COULD BE THE WORK

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:52.269
ISN'T BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND

00:52:52.335 --> 00:52:53.503
ISN'T BEING DONE IN EARNEST. OR

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.671
THAT IF IS THERE IS A BENCH

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.506
FARMER A RANCHER HAS A CHALLENGE

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.108
WITH THE FARMER FACING PROGRAM

00:52:58.174 --> 00:52:59.042
AT THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWED LEVEL.

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:00.644
THEIR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO NOT

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.045
ADDRESS THE PROGRAM IN QUESTION

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:03.713
BUT TO GO TO THE FORMER EQUITY

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.681
POSITION AND RE CREATE A NEW

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:06.983
PROGRAM. THAT SERVES THEM THERE.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.585
I THINK OUR PERSPECTIVE AT FARM

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:09.786
BUREAU IS THAT EVERYONE DESERVES

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:11.588
A SEAT AT THE TABLE. AND THE

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:12.923
TABLE NOT BIG ENOUGH YOU DON'T

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:14.858
BUILD A NEW TABLE FOR SOMEBODY

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.226
ELSE. YOU MAKE THE TABLE BIGGER

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:18.094
YOU SCOOCH DOWN TO MAKE ROOM. SO

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:19.996
I THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT- THE

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:21.631
PROGRAM IS REALLY. ILL PLACE TO

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:23.300

00:53:23.366 --> 00:53:25.001
