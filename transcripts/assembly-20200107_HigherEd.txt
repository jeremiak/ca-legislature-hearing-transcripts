THAT IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT SINCE MY- PARTICULAR IN A CHANGING SOCIETY.

WELCOME THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL AND I- EXCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. ON PAGE FIVE. AB NINE SIXTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THE CHANCELLOR OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES OFFICE TO ATTACK ESTABLISH. A NATURALIST WORKFORCE MODEL CURRICULUM BY JULY THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO THE ACADEMIC YEAR. CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN FOR ITS BEAUTIFUL NATURAL RESOURCES AND PRIDES ITSELF ON CONSERVATION OF THOSE RESOURCES. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA'S PRECIOUS RESOURCES CONSERVE AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT WILLIS. SUPPORT OUR WORK FORCE AFTER OF NATURALISTIC CONSERVATIONIST IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE USUALLY THE STEPPING STONE FOR OUR WORK FORCE ON AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. OUT THERE GETTING THE SKILLS THAT TO BE THE STORE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE CAN BE I. HAVE A WITNESS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURN MEMBERS I DANIEL THEN CHAIR ON BEHALF OF COMMUNITY NATURE CONNECTION WE'RE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT PROVIDES UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WITH ACCESS TO THE PHYSICAL OUTDOORS AS WELL AS TRAINING AND A CAREER PATHWAYS TO ACTUALLY ENTER THE NATURALIST COMPACT. FIELD I'M ALTHOUGH THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT I COULD LAST AS TO WHY WE SUPPORT THIS BILL ALL QUICKLY VERY VERY BRIEFLY IDENTIFIED THREE. THE FIRST IS THAT THIS BELT WOULD ENABLE MORE STUDENTS ACTUALLY ENROLL IN THESE PROGRAMS TO ENTER THIS FIELD ALTHOUGH. THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO OFFER SIMILAR PROGRAMS BECAUSE MOST DO NOT HAVE EITHER THE RESOURCES OR THE EXPERTISE TO ACTUALLY CREATE THESE THIS CURRICULUM FROM SCRATCH. THIS WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW. A TASK FORCE OF EXPERTS TO COME UP WITH A BASE STANDARD CURRICULUM THAT THEY COULD- THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO MORE EASILY AND QUICKLY IMPLEMENT THIS CURRICULUM IN THESE COURSES AT THEIR INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES- SECOND IS THAT. THIS WAY- CREATE REAL JOBS NOT JUST AGREES THAT BY AT REQUIRING THAT THIS CURRICULUM INCLUDES CLEAR PARTNERSHIPS WITH A DIFFERENT ENTITIES LIKE STATE PARKS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS LIKE COMMUNITY NATURE CONNECTION. IT WOULD ACTUALLY CREATE CLEAR PATHWAYS INTO JOBS AT THOSE DIFFERENT SITES. AND THEN THIRD I THINK IT'S BECOMING UNFORTUNATELY CLEAR THAT THERE IS A LACK OF WORK FORCE IN THIS NATURALIST CAREER- THERE ARE LOTS OF YOU KNOW NEEDS LOTS OF- DISASTERS THAT ARE HAPPENING LÃ  TO PARK CITY TO BE. LOTS SAYS THAT NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND NOT MERELY A ENOUGH WORK FORCE TO ACTUALLY BE READY TO DROP CAREER SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY ENABLE- ANY HE DID AN AYE. DADDY I FORCE TO ACTUALLY AYE. THOSE CAREERS ESPECIALLY TOP. THOSE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE REALLY EXCITED AND IF THOSE JOBS AND FOR THOSE REASONS I'M WERE IN VERY MUCH SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND THINK. THAT ARE FOR INTRODUCED. SERVING SEE AUDUBON CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS LATINO OUTDOORS ALL IN SUPPORT. NATALIE NEXT ON BEHALF OF MID PENINSULA REGIONAL OPEN SPACE DISTRICT AND FRIENDS OF THE LA RIVER IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY TWEETERS. HELLO MORGAN CAMINO BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS IS WITH THE SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT THE STATE CERTIFIED LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS IS BEING COLLUDED AS ONE OF THE REQUIRED CONSULTING ENTITIES DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CURRICULUM DUE TO OUR STATUS AS A STATE CERTIFIED CORPS AND OUR EXISTING WORK IN PARTNERSHIP TO DEVELOP SIMILAR CURRICULUM WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DO CONSIDER OURSELVES EXPERTS ON THIS ISSUE. AND A POSITIVE ADDITION TO THESE CONCERTS CONVERSATIONS- WE THINK AUTHORS OFFICE FOR THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO A POSITIVE RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I JUST AND SILICON CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION AT THIS TIME. AND WHAT WE DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD. AND WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A CONCERN AROUND THE I JUST ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT FOR CREATING CURRICULUM A REQUIRING CURRICULUMS STATUTE. OUTSIDE OF OUR NORMAL PROCESSES FOR CURRICULUM AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU. CHEN MEMBERS ALSO WEBSTER DOWN THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF THE COAST AND RANCHO SANTIAGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SALA LINER COMMENTS WITH A CHANCE WAS OFFICE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DOCTOR CHOI. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA THIS IS AN INTERESTING- BILL I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS AND NUMBER ONE IS DOES THAT MEAN THAT- TO BECOME THEN SO CALLED A NATURALIST. IS A PATHWAY TO. FOR THE TWO LEADERS TO JOB BUT- AND OUT WILL IT THE REQUIRED TO BECOME THE NATURALIST OR I IS THIS JUSTO. ONE OF THE. COURSES SO FOR EXAMPLE OR ANY OTHER MAJOR SO CAN THEY GET A JOB AS A NATURALIST YEAH I MEAN WHICH IS HELPING TO CREATE A TO WORK FIRST DEVELOPMENT SO IT'S NOT AN ACTUAL DEGREE ON AND SO THERE'S A LOT TO THE POLICE TO ENTER INTO THIS WORK BILL WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IS IN MY DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE I ONLY HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS THE HIGHER AT THAT'S THE GROUP ARE A LOT OF MY STUDENTS ARE GOING BUT THEY'RE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO THIS CAREER IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT THE GATEWAY THAT THEY'RE BEING EXPOSED ARE BEING EXPOSED TO NONPROFIT THAT THE NATURE CONNECTION AS A PROGRAMMER READY TO LEAD YOU INTO THAT DEGREE OR INTO THAT PROFESSION ON THREE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND DIFFERENT CAMPUSES OR OTHER JOBS ARE THE CORPSE ALSO AND SO I DO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THEIR REQUEST AND I WILL BE WORKING WITH THEM TO GET THEM TO A SUPPORT. SYSTEM ON AND SO. I JUST ANOTHER AVENUE TO. TOOLS ARE AWARE THAT THIS IS A POSSIBILITY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO ENTITIES ENTITIES ALIKE IN NATURAL CONSERVATION. WOULD PREFER SOMEBODY WHO FOCUSED ON THIS KIND OF A STUDY. SO THAT'S WHAT I GET. YEAH SO I WOULD ACTUALLY- THERE ARE SEVERAL PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THAT DO EXIST WHEN I WOULD POINT NOW IS THE UC NATURALIST PROGRAM- WHAT. THE INTENTION REALLY AS THERE IS TO BOTH INFORM STUDENTS THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY AND THIS IS A CAREER PATH THAT DOES ACTUALLY LEAD TO. SUSTAINABLE AND FAMILY- SUSTAINING JOBS. SO WHAT IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY DO IS IT WOULD CREATE A SPACE FOR THEM TO START BECOMING INFORMED- INFORM THEM ABOUT WHAT THOSE CERTIFICATIONS AND TYPES OF JOBS. WOULD BE. AND THAT WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO IS ACTUALLY REQUIRE THEM TO. PARTNER WITH LOCAL OR STATE OR GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THAT COULD COME IN AND ACTUALLY CONNECT THEM TO PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF THE COLLEGE. THAT COULD THEN PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT. CERTIFICATIONS THE TRAIN THE ON THE GROUND- WORK AND THE ACTUAL CAREER PATHWAYS AN ACTUAL JOB PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. TO OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SO FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WHEN THE- OUR FOCUS ON THIS CURRICULUM THEN THEY WILL GRADUATE THE WITH THE A DEGREE IN. SOMETHING THAT TORE STATUS THAT IS SET DROUGHT WHITE. WE THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT CREATING A DEGREE IT'S UNTIL IS A SO WHAT I MEAN I THINK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS IT GONNA BE WHAT THE CERTIFICATION WHAT IS IT. SO I THINK THAT IT WOULD REALLY BE IT- UP TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THEN THAT TASK FORCE THAT'S IT REALLY IDENTIFYING WHAT IS THAT INTEREST AND WHAT IS WHAT IT WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLY AVAILABLE AND WHAT IF THEY WANT TO OFFER TO THE STUDENTS I COULD SEE THAT TEY COULD PROBABLY DECIDE THAT THEY WOULD DO YOU WANT TO OFFER MUCH- HIGHER DEGREES HERE OR IT COULD BE. MORE OF A KIND OF CONNECTION COURSE SO I THINK- BY ALLOWING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THEN I THINK IT'S CALLED THE SENATE- CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SENATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S CAN ACTUALLY APPROVED THAT CURRICULUM IT AND BRING IN EXPERTS WHO ARE IN THIS FIELD AND KIND OF KNOW HOW TO CREATE A CURRICULUM AND ARE OUT ON THE FIELD DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK. BY REQUIRING THAT THEY ALL COME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THE CURRICULUM I THINK THAT'S HOW THEY WOULD REALLY IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE DEGREES THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO OFFER IS THAT NOT ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT'S TANGIBLE ARE VIABLE OR THAT FOLKS ARE INTERESTED IN OR HAVE WHAT DIRECTION THEY WANT TO GO OUT. INTO CREE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THE ANSWERS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT FITS THEM BUT ENSURING THAT THERE IS AT LEAST SOME SORT OF AN AVENUE THAT WE ARE INFORMING. THE STUDENTS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF NATURAL AS OF THE CAREER- BUT WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE FLEXIBILITY HERE SO THAT. NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. NO I DO SEE A OF GREAT POTENTIAL THAT THE GOOD CURRICULUM CAN BE DEVELOPED- AND THEN I'M COMING FROM A CITY OF FOUR OR FIVE WAY A ONE THIRD OF ALL CITY IS OPEN SPACE AND THEN APPLYING CONSERVATION CORPS. I'M IN THE THAT'S WHAT THEY DO HOW TO MAINTAIN AND THE OR SO AT THE SAME TIME TO MAKE IT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC TO ENJOY SO TO GET THE GOOD BALANCE. AND THE UTILIZING THE VOLUNTEERS IN ALL. THAT ALONE WOULD REQUIRE SOME SOME LEVEL OF SKILL SET. SO IF FOR THIS IS A INTRODUCED A FOR SOMEBODY. I WOULD LIKE TO MMHM BECOME A SPECIALIST A MAJOR IN THE COURSE TO HAVE A DEGREE IN COLLEGE THEN THE FOR YOUR UNIVERSITY IS A WOULD HAVE- A PATHWAY TO LEAD TO A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN THIS- NATURALLY SCORES OF THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK FOR A TO THINK ABOUT AS A NEXT STEP. I DEMAND THAT SEPARATING THE DIRECTION THAT WE ARE TAKING WITH THIS BILL BUT WHILE ALLOWING SOME FLEXIBILITY TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT THAT IS. THAT IS OUR HOPE A LOT OF TIMES STUDENTS IN MY DISTRICT THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ARE NOT AWARE THAT THIS IS EVEN AN OPTION TO THINK ABOUT A DEGREE AND THAT THEY STEP TO COULD BE TAKING. AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BEFORE THEY TRANSFER TO STEP INTO THAT SPACE AND SO UP FOR ME FOR EXAMPLE WERE WORKING ON A RIVER VENTURES PROGRAM FOR THE REAL HONDA AND DALY RIVER. ON AND WE LIKE THEIR IT'S TV LOCAL HIRES AROUND THAT BUT- WHEN A NATURALIST. TRAINING WOULD BE A NATURAL POSITION. I TO GET YOU INTO THAT SPACE BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND IN MY COMMUNITY. AT ALL AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE DEVELOPING THIS GREAT PROGRAM I'M ABLE TO HIRE AND TRAIN LOCAL FOLKS. ALONG THE WAY WHILE I ALLOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO CLEAN THE CONSERVATION CORPS THAT THE THOUGHT EXPERIENCE TO TELL US. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT WOULD ONLY TO START FROM SCRATCH AND- ONE STEP. OUGHT TO COULD CAUSE THAT FITS INTO THE STEPS ARE ALREADY OUT THERE INCLUDING. PROGRAMS THAT DO EXIST AT THE UC'S MY CAL STATES IN THE FOUR YOU'RE NEVER CITIES. THANK YOU.
