MODEL A WHEN IT COMES FOR ME TOO

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:47.307 region:rollup2
LATE SYSTEM. BUT ONE THING IS

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:49.776 region:rollup2
CLEAR BUT THE SYSTEM IS STRAINED

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:52.979 region:rollup2

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:03.590 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:05.058 region:rollup2

UNFILLED.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:13.366 region:rollup2
IT'S SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE IN

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:14.834 region:rollup2
THIS ERA OF NEW NORMAL. BUT IN

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:16.736 region:rollup2
THESE UNANSWERED CALLS HAVE

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:18.405 region:rollup2
DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES.

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:20.006 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS OF

00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:21.775 region:rollup2
THE NORTH BAY. FIRESTORM

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:23.543 region:rollup2
BREAKING OUT OVER THREE HUNDRED

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:25.078 region:rollup2

I BELIEVE A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.761 region:rollup2

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:44.698 region:rollup2

HUNDRED MILLION MAY BE A LOT TO

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:53.873 region:rollup2

SYSTEM.

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:29.082 region:rollup2
THAT SYSTEM WAS THE BASSIST THAT

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:30.516 region:rollup2
THAT BECAME THE UP THE NATIONAL

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.784 region:rollup2

ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:35.688 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ALL

AS SENATE MCGUIRE SAY THAT EACH

AND EVERY TIME WE LEARN BUT WE

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:51.337 region:rollup2
NEED TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT.

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:51.671 region:rollup2
ARE MODERNIZING THE SYSTEM AS WE

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:53.139 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD.

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:53.840 region:rollup2
.

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.975 region:rollup2
THIS SYSTEM.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.111 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED IS ALL HAZARDS.

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:58.811 region:rollup2
IT'S PREDICATED ON ON

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.414 region:rollup2
LEVERAGING.

00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:03.249 region:rollup2
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LOCAL

ELECTED BODIES ABILITY TO

DECLARE LOCAL EMERGENCIES ARE

00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:10.490 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE ABILITY TO

00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:12.692 region:rollup2
PROCLAIM A STATE OF EMERGENCY.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.027 region:rollup2
AND OR A UTILIZING THE

.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.301 region:rollup2
BUT THE PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:22.869 region:rollup2
R. IT ALSO SPEAKS TO CASES I

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.337 region:rollup2
GOT FOR BED OF THE STATE OF WAR

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:26.139 region:rollup2
ALL BUT ALSO FOR TERRORISM

00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:27.206 region:rollup2
RELATED TODD TYPES OF ACTIVITY

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:29.342 region:rollup2
SO SECURITY.

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:31.110 region:rollup2
THREATS THAT THE STATE AND ALL

00:13:29.342 --> 00:13:33.179 region:rollup2
OF THAT IS THE FIND ARE IN WHAT

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.914 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IN STATUETTE CALLED

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:37.083 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT.

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:38.685 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THIS WORK SO THE THE

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.085 region:rollup2
WAY THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED IS

00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:39.952 region:rollup2
THAT?

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:41.854 region:rollup2
WHEN.

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:43.156 region:rollup2
EVENTS EXCEED IN JURISDICTIONS

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:45.391 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:47.060 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM CAN

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:48.995 region:rollup2
BE LEVERAGED TO ASCERTAIN THE

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.863 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:52.465 region:rollup2
AND IT'S VERY FOCUSED ON THE

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:54.534 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR

00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:56.402 region:rollup2
THAT JURISDICTION TO BE ABLE TO

00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:58.504 region:rollup2
MITIGATE WHATEVER CASE THEY'RE

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:59.639 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH ARE IF BIG IF THE

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.674 region:rollup2
IF THE EVENTS BECOME MORE

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:03.309 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED IN SIZE AND SCOPE

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:05.144 region:rollup2
AND SCALE.

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:06.479 region:rollup2
THEN.

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:08.548 region:rollup2
OR THE EVENTS REQUIRE INVOLVE

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:09.916 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS THAT CYST

00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:11.417 region:rollup2
THAT MUTUALLY SYSTEM IS ALLOWED

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:13.352 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND AND.

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:14.387 region:rollup2
AND THOSE THOSE RESOURCES ARE

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:15.388 region:rollup2
OBTAINED.

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:18.157 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:18.691 region:rollup2
A SERIES OF OF A STANDARD ICE

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:21.361 region:rollup2
PROCESS HE STARTING AT THE

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:23.696 region:rollup2
LOCAL.

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:25.765 region:rollup2
CITY LEVEL. OUGHT TO A.

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:27.433 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL AN OPERATIONAL

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:29.702 region:rollup2
AREA COORDINATOR IT SET COUNTY

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:30.837 region:rollup2
COORDINATOR TYPICALLY A LOCAL

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.504 region:rollup2
FIRE CHIEF?

00:14:30.837 --> 00:14:33.206 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:34.674 region:rollup2
I THINK COULD BE SOMEWHAT LIKE

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.742 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE TO CAL FIRE

00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:37.844 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES OPERATES THAT IN THE

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:40.046 region:rollup2
INS IN THE IN THE UP AND UP.

00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:42.115 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING LOCAL FIRE AND THEN

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.316 region:rollup2
IT GOES UP INTO A REGIONAL.

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:45.084 region:rollup2
WHICH IS MULTIPLE COUNTIES

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:46.919 region:rollup2
ALL WERE REGIONAL COORDINATORS

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:48.221 region:rollup2
THEN I CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:49.322 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE BETTER

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:52.625 region:rollup2
SITTING WITHIN.

00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:54.427 region:rollup2
A REGION SO THE THE.

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:56.129 region:rollup2
THE OPERATIONAL AREA OR THE

00:14:54.427 --> 00:14:57.797 region:rollup2
COUNTY COORDINATOR IS LOOKING AT

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:59.599 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT EXIST IN ALL THE

00:14:57.797 --> 00:15:00.666 region:rollup2
CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY. AND

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:02.702 region:rollup2
THE REGIONAL COORDINATOR IS

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:04.537 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT ALL THE RESOURCES

00:15:02.702 --> 00:15:06.672 region:rollup2
THAT ARE WITHIN. A MULTIPLE

00:15:04.537 --> 00:15:08.007 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WITHIN A REGION AND

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:09.809 region:rollup2
THEN OF COURSE IF IT STILL.

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:11.844 region:rollup2
NEEDED SPECIALIZED RESOURCES OR

00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:13.713 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION IS SO COMPLEX IT

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:16.315 region:rollup2
COMES UP TO. A STATE WE ASK

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:18.418 region:rollup2
HEADQUARTERS WHERE WE LOOK AT IT

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:19.385 region:rollup2
FROM A STATEWIDE BASIS LOOKING

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:21.220 region:rollup2
AT EVERY JURISDICTION IN

BE ABLE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:29.495 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT ALL OF

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:31.464 region:rollup2
THOSE RESOURCES

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:33.065 region:rollup2
FROM THAT. CALIFORNIA MEXICAN

BORDER TO THE CALIFORNIA OREGON

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:37.036 region:rollup2
BORDER ARE AVAILABLE IN THE

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:39.672 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND ALL OF THEM CAN BE.

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:42.041 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO A LOCAL FIRE CHIEF

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:43.509 region:rollup2
IN THIS CONTEXT TO SUPPORT BAD

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:44.977 region:rollup2
INCIDENT SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:46.379 region:rollup2
A FIRE CHIEF WITHOUT FIRE

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:48.614 region:rollup2

FIREFIGHTERS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF

00:15:56.422 --> 00:16:00.793 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTERS. BAD TO BE ABLE TO.

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:01.461 region:rollup2
THE LEVERAGE THAT CAPABILITY.

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:04.597 region:rollup2
AND.

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:06.732 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE STATE CAN ALSO.

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:08.901 region:rollup2
ARE AS SENATOR JACKSON MENTION

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:10.236 region:rollup2
GO OUT OF STATE FOR OUT OF STATE

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:12.171 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO UP TO A VERY

00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:14.674 region:rollup2
SOPHISTICATED. CORE DATA PROCESS

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:15.741 region:rollup2
AND AN INITIALLY INTERNATIONALLY

00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:17.210 region:rollup2
ARE AS WE DID.

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:18.778 region:rollup2
IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES IN THIS

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.379 region:rollup2
CASE WE HAD A NUMBER OF FIRE

00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:23.249 region:rollup2
UNITS FROM ALL OVER THE UNITED

BOB.

00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:30.590 region:rollup2
SO THE.

00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:32.725 region:rollup2
THE PLAN IS IS IS PUT IS PRETTY

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.827 region:rollup2
SOLID IT IT PROVIDES FOR THAT

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:37.230 region:rollup2
SYSTEMATIC MOBILIZATION LAW AND

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:39.332 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION OPERATION UP A FIRE

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:09.829 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF FIRE SPECIFIC.

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:11.864 region:rollup2
ALL THAT THE THE REQUIREMENT HAS

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:13.966 region:rollup2
INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY OVER THE

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:15.635 region:rollup2
LAST FEW YEARS UP OF THE NEED TO

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:18.237 region:rollup2
TAP INTO THE SYSTEM BATCHES FOR

00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:19.906 region:rollup2
FIRE ALONE. WE HAVE ALSO

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:24.644 region:rollup2
MOBILIZED IN THE IN THE MOST

00:17:19.906 --> 00:17:25.444 region:rollup2
RECENT YEARS FOR US SOME VERY

00:17:24.644 --> 00:17:26.078 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FLOODING

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:27.647 region:rollup2
FOR OF COURSE UNFORTUNATELY THE

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:29.282 region:rollup2
MUD. FLOWS IN SANTA BARBARA UP

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:30.449 region:rollup2
FOR MAJOR HAZMAT INCIDENTS

00:17:29.282 --> 00:17:30.983 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE TRAIN

EVENTS.

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:36.455 region:rollup2
SO THE SYSTEM IS VERY VERY BUSY

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.523 region:rollup2
IT'S COMPREHENSIVE IT'S

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:39.292 region:rollup2
COMPATIBLE WITH THE STATE

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:41.627 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY PLAN AND WITH OTHER

JURISDICTIONS OPERATE UNDER

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:47.934 region:rollup2
THOSE PLANS TO BE.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:49.435 region:rollup2
STATE FIRE RESCUE PLAN IS AN

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:51.003 region:rollup2
ANNEX TO THIS TO THE STATE

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:52.772 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY PLAN WHICH IS THE OVER

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:55.074 region:rollup2
ARCHING. ALTHOUGH THE

00:17:52.772 --> 00:17:56.142 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS IN IN CALIFORNIA

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.909 region:rollup2
ALL FALL UNDER THAT.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.952 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ARE AND THAT DATABASE

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:14.787 region:rollup2
SYSTEM INTEGRITY IS REALLY MADE

00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:16.422 region:rollup2
UP OF OF AYE AYE DAVID DAY

00:19:14.787 --> 00:19:17.223 region:rollup2
COORDINATION WITH OUR LOCAL FIRE

00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:19.525 region:rollup2
CHIEFS.

00:19:17.223 --> 00:19:21.727 region:rollup2
A LOCAL FIRE AGENCIES ARE

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:23.129 region:rollup2
REGIONAL COORDINATORS AND AND OF

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:25.031 region:rollup2
COURSE OUR PARTNERS ACCOUNT FIRE

00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:25.297 region:rollup2
AND AS I MENTIONED THE OTHER

00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:26.265 region:rollup2
AGENCIES.

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:28.768 region:rollup2
.

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:30.936 region:rollup2
UP THE IMPACTS ON THE SYSTEM

00:19:28.768 --> 00:19:33.039 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN. THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:35.241 region:rollup2
HARM I HAVE IN MY. THIRTY YEARS

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:36.809 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT SEEN THE LEVEL OF

00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:38.077 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:40.513 region:rollup2
THEM THAT AND THE AMOUNT OF

00:19:38.077 --> 00:19:41.113 region:rollup2
IMPACTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN. ARM

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:41.447 region:rollup2
AND DOWN AND I KNOW WE'RE HERE

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:43.149 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT

00:19:41.447 --> 00:19:44.817 region:rollup2
TODAY AND.

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:47.119 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT THAT MONITORS

00:19:44.817 --> 00:19:49.889 region:rollup2
MODERNIZATION OF THE SYSTEM.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:51.857 region:rollup2
IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IT TAKE

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:53.659 region:rollup2
INTO CONSIDERATION ONE I THINK

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.060 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FEW AREAS OF THAT I'D

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:55.828 region:rollup2
LIKE TO NOTE ABOUT

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.431 region:rollup2
MODERNIZATION.

00:19:55.828 --> 00:20:00.166 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT DUMB AYE

00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:02.368 region:rollup2
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS.

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:05.137 region:rollup2
GETTING AYE HAVING THE ABILITY

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:05.905 region:rollup2
TO GET REAL TIME REAL.

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:09.575 region:rollup2
WHO?

00:20:05.905 --> 00:20:12.678 region:rollup2
UP A SITUATIONAL CONDITIONS AS

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:14.447 region:rollup2
THEIR EVOLVING OR UNFOLDING IN

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:16.649 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO GET THAT INTO THE.

00:20:14.447 --> 00:20:19.251 region:rollup2
AT EACH OF THESE LEVELS IS VERY

00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:21.053 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT THAT. ICQ I OFTEN

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:23.122 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT MEN BEING ABLE TO

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:24.924 region:rollup2
STAY OUT IN FRONT OF EVOLVING

00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:26.492 region:rollup2
CRISIS AND ANY GRIEF ALL THE

00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:27.893 region:rollup2
DISASTERS BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU

00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:29.261 region:rollup2
LET THE DISASTER GET OUT IN

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:31.497 region:rollup2
FRONT OF YOU. YOU ARE IN A

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:33.566 region:rollup2
DEFENSIVE POSTURE YOU NEVER CAN

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:36.068 region:rollup2
REALLY CATCH UP IF IT EXPANDS

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:37.336 region:rollup2
EXPONENTIALLY WITH EACH HOUR SO

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:38.637 region:rollup2
STAYING OUT IN FRONT OF A

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:40.072 region:rollup2
DISASTER IS A VERY VERY

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:41.674 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FAKE.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:43.209 region:rollup2
THE WORK PICKED UP THE CHIEF PAM

00:20:41.674 --> 00:20:46.011 region:rollup2
WHAT I DO WITH WITH THE OTHER

00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:47.847 region:rollup2
PARTNERS IS. EARLY ON PASSED THE

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:50.082 region:rollup2
NEED TO GET OUT IN FRONT I THINK

00:20:47.847 --> 00:20:51.584 region:rollup2
THIS IS PLAYED OUT AS YOU YOU

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:53.385 region:rollup2
YOU WHAT YOU OBSERVED BUT IN

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:55.087 region:rollup2
THIS LAST SERIES OF DISASTERS

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:56.422 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:57.323 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO STAY OUT IN FRONT OF

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:59.525 region:rollup2
THE.

00:20:57.323 --> 00:21:00.392 region:rollup2
EVOLVING SITUATION.

00:20:59.525 --> 00:21:02.328 region:rollup2
THE CASE.

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:03.929 region:rollup2
WAS NOT POSSIBLE ARE IN THE

00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:06.031 region:rollup2
CASE OF THE NORTHERN FIRES THESE

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:07.166 region:rollup2
FIRES IS THAT IS CAN WILL TELL

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:09.235 region:rollup2
YOU WERE MOVING AT.

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:11.237 region:rollup2
A AND UNBELIEVABLE RATE THEY

00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:11.837 region:rollup2
WERE EXTREME CONDITIONS AND YOU

00:21:11.237 --> 00:21:13.639 region:rollup2
KNOW HUMANLY POSSIBLE ABILITY

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:16.108 region:rollup2
TO.

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:17.710 region:rollup2
TO GET A RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:19.445 region:rollup2
PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.981 region:rollup2
SO THAT SAID IF YOU CAN'T OUT

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:24.250 region:rollup2
RUN IT YOU HAVE TO ANTICIPATED

00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:25.918 region:rollup2
AND ANTICIPATING IT IS USING

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:28.454 region:rollup2
GOOD PREDICTIVE.

00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:29.722 region:rollup2
SERVICES LOOKING LOOKING AT THE

00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:31.724 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS AND THEN PRE

00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:33.058 region:rollup2
POSITIONING RESOURCES IN THE

00:21:31.724 --> 00:21:35.194 region:rollup2
RIGHT PLACE SO THAT THEIR

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:37.029 region:rollup2
INITIAL ATTACK CAN GET IN AND

00:21:35.194 --> 00:21:38.831 region:rollup2
KEEP FIRE SMALL. AND WHEN YOU

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:40.199 region:rollup2
GOT THESE BIG WIN VANCE YOU GOT

00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:41.734 region:rollup2
THESE VERY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:43.235 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT RESOURCES PLACED

00:21:41.734 --> 00:21:45.538 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY IN DIFFERENT PARTS

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:47.439 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE SO. PRE POSITIONING

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:48.707 region:rollup2
IS A ONE OF THOSE AREAS BUT IT

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:50.476 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT GOOD

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:51.811 region:rollup2
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:53.445 region:rollup2
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IS AN

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.780 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IN OUR TECHNOLOGY.

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:56.649 region:rollup2
ARE IMPROVEMENT IN KNOWING WHERE

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.617 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ARE LOCATED AT ANY

00:21:56.649 --> 00:22:00.019 region:rollup2
TIME THROUGH THINGS LIKE OUR

00:21:58.617 --> 00:22:00.853 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATOR IT

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:01.754 region:rollup2

COORDINATORS ABA.

00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:08.394 region:rollup2
WE WE ALSO OF OF A COUPLE YEARS

00:22:06.392 --> 00:22:09.295 region:rollup2
AGO AT A COLLABORATION WITH CAL

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:10.796 region:rollup2
FIRE AND.

00:22:09.295 --> 00:22:12.198 region:rollup2
THE US DEPARTMENT HOMELAND

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:13.732 region:rollup2
SECURITY CITED TEXT ALL

00:22:12.198 --> 00:22:15.100 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY DIRECTORATE.

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:16.402 region:rollup2
STARTED TO WORK ON SOMETHING

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.771 region:rollup2
CALLED THE NEXT GENERATION

00:22:16.402 --> 00:22:20.239 region:rollup2
INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM A THIS

00:22:18.771 --> 00:22:23.342 region:rollup2
IS A SITUATIONAL TOOL WEEK.

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:24.376 region:rollup2
SCOUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IF CIOS

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:26.412 region:rollup2
FOR SITUATION AWARENESS

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:29.248 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION TOOL AND THAT IT'S

00:22:26.412 --> 00:22:30.382 region:rollup2
A TOOL THAT IT IS NOW EVOLVING

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:32.885 region:rollup2
ALL BUT BUT SOMETHING THAT WE

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:34.119 region:rollup2
NEED TO INVEST MUCH MORE AND. I

00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:35.788 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT IS GIVING US SOME

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:37.423 region:rollup2
OF THIS THIS THE SITUATIONAL

00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:38.791 region:rollup2
AWARENESS THAT I'M TALKING A.

00:22:37.423 --> 00:22:39.391 region:rollup2
I'M AND WE'RE DOING THIS IN A

00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:40.860 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH OUR

00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:42.027 region:rollup2
PART

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.696 region:rollup2
AUSTRALIA ACTUALLY.

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:44.897 region:rollup2
US BECAUSE THEY HAVEA VERY

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:46.398 region:rollup2
SIMILAR KIND AWHILE SO WE'RE

00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:48.667 region:rollup2
LEARNING WILDFIRE THREATS WE'RE

00:22:46.398 --> 00:22:50.302 region:rollup2
LEARNING FROM THEM AS AS WELL AS

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:52.338 region:rollup2
THEM ALERTING FROM EYES IN THAT

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:53.439 region:rollup2
THAT BILLS THAT PARTNERSHIP. AND

00:22:52.338 --> 00:22:55.441 region:rollup2
IN IN SCOUT IS NOW BEING

00:22:53.439 --> 00:22:56.275 region:rollup2
UTILIZED IN A PROTOTYPE

00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:58.010 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:22:56.275 --> 00:22:59.912 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE USE THAT. ARE IN

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.380 region:rollup2
THE LAST THE OUT OF FIRES AND IT

00:22:59.912 --> 00:23:03.549 region:rollup2
IS PROVING TO BE REALLY A GREAT

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.916 region:rollup2
TOOL IN ITS ITS CONTINUING TO

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:05.651 region:rollup2
EVOLVE.

00:23:03.916 --> 00:23:08.721 region:rollup2
BOB.

00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:10.923 region:rollup2
SO WE TALK ABOUT OF TECHNOLOGY.

00:23:08.721 --> 00:23:13.292 region:rollup2
.

00:23:10.923 --> 00:23:14.393 region:rollup2
BUT MODERNISATION OUR REQUIRES

00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:16.228 region:rollup2
OF FORMALIZING THAT CLEAR

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:18.397 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THE RESOURCES

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:19.732 region:rollup2
NEEDS IN A TIMELY WAY OP

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:21.900 region:rollup2
RESOURCE REQUESTING COMING TO A

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:23.736 region:rollup2
STANDARD SYSTEM ENSURING THAT.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.703 region:rollup2
FOR THE YEARS TO COME IF YOU

00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:26.071 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS WAS BUILT IN

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:27.973 region:rollup2
NINETEEN FIFTY AND HERE WE ARE

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:29.875 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WERE STILL

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:31.810 region:rollup2
USING THE SYSTEM IT'S INCUMBENT

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:33.579 region:rollup2
UPON FOLKS LIKE US. TO MAKE SURE

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.614 region:rollup2
THAT THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS THIS

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:37.383 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS STILL OPERATING IN THE

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:38.751 region:rollup2
WAY IT WAS DESIGNED BUT IT'S

00:23:37.383 --> 00:23:40.986 region:rollup2
BETTER AND IT'S A BIG MEETING

00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:42.354 region:rollup2
THE NEED A FORTY FIFTY MILLION

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:43.656 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHATEVER CALLOUS

THE SYSTEM.

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:18.056 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANYTHING WE MIGHT TO TO

00:39:16.054 --> 00:39:19.490 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE MORE COLLABORATION

00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:21.192 region:rollup2

00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:35.640 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'VE USED THEM A LOT AND

00:39:34.172 --> 00:39:37.008 region:rollup2
A LOT OF CASES THEY DO BRING

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.676 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO THE TABLE.

00:39:37.008 --> 00:39:40.211 region:rollup2

FUNDING SOURCES ARE CAN COME

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:10.875 region:rollup2
FROM A VARIETY OF AREAS IT IT

00:40:09.841 --> 00:40:12.610 region:rollup2
REALLY DEPENDS UPON.

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:15.146 region:rollup2
.

DURING THAT PARTICULAR TIME SO.

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:26.691 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IF FROM YOUR FATHER

THEY CAN'T COME FROM.

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:11.095 region:rollup2
SO IF WE ARE SEEING MORE AND

THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE WHEN

00:42:29.447 --> 00:42:31.883 region:rollup2
THESE LOCAL AGENCIES LOOK AT

00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:33.384 region:rollup2
THEIR BOTTOM LINE THEY DON'T

00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:34.552 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO COVER

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:36.120 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN AREA AND THEY DON'T

00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:37.288 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.589 region:rollup2
DO IT EITHER IS IS THERE

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:40.291 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE COULD DO GOING

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:41.759 region:rollup2
FORWARD ON? THAT.

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:42.760 region:rollup2
WELL I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:43.995 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING NOW

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.364 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY.

00:42:43.995 --> 00:42:48.199 region:rollup2
AT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE SEEING A

00:42:46.364 --> 00:42:51.302 region:rollup2
I'M A POTENTIAL SCENARIO

00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:52.670 region:rollup2
EVOLVING WHERE WE WHERE IT LOOKS

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:55.873 region:rollup2
LIKE A FIRE IS GOING TO A YOU

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:57.809 region:rollup2
KNOW WE GET BIGGER OR GET THEM.

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:59.343 region:rollup2
SEVERE IN A PARTICULAR AREA IS

00:42:57.809 --> 00:42:59.911 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO MOVE LOCAL

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:00.912 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT RESOURCES AND BE

00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:03.548 region:rollup2

TO COVER THEIR COSTS IN IN THAT.

00:43:03.548 --> 00:43:09.086 region:rollup2
WILL BE CALLED THAT GOTTEN NAM.

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:10.354 region:rollup2
BUT TIM HIS.

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:12.356 region:rollup2
THE MOVE UP A COVER WE HAVE THE.

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:13.825 region:rollup2
WEAKEST REPOSITIONING SORRY UP

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:14.792 region:rollup2
REPOSITIONING RESOURCES.

00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:16.928 region:rollup2
AND.

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:18.563 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE AREA.

00:43:16.928 --> 00:43:18.830 region:rollup2
A A YOU KNOW.

00:43:18.563 --> 00:43:19.397 region:rollup2
GENERALLY.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.866 region:rollup2
.

00:43:19.397 --> 00:43:22.767 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:43:21.866 --> 00:43:25.403 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME DEPARTMENTS THAT

00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:26.404 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF PERSONNEL BUT NOT

00:43:25.403 --> 00:43:27.572 region:rollup2
ENOUGH EQUIPMENT AND THERE'S

00:43:26.404 --> 00:43:28.739 region:rollup2
SOME DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE MORE

EQUIPMENT AND NOT ENOUGH

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:33.144 region:rollup2

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:35.079 region:rollup2
COTTAGES ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:43:33.144 --> 00:43:37.882 region:rollup2

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:39.617 region:rollup2
SPECTRUMS COULD HELP EITHER BY.

00:43:37.882 --> 00:43:41.719 region:rollup2
ADDING ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT

00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:43.721 region:rollup2
INTO THE SYSTEM OUGHT TO BE ABLE

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:45.690 region:rollup2
TO MEET THOSE NEEDS ARE ARE

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:46.691 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO AUGMENT THE OAS

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:48.626 region:rollup2
ENGINE FLEET.

00:43:46.691 --> 00:43:51.162 region:rollup2
THAT IS SO THAT IS ACTUALLY UP

00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:51.529 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM THAT AS YOU KNOW OF

00:43:51.162 --> 00:43:53.264 region:rollup2
THOSE.

00:43:51.529 --> 00:43:55.266 region:rollup2
YES ENGINES ARE GIVEN TO LOCAL

00:43:53.264 --> 00:43:56.501 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT UNDER AN AGREEMENT

00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:58.503 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN THE STATE NEEDS THEM

00:43:56.501 --> 00:44:00.138 region:rollup2
THEN THEY DEPLOY THOSE. ODD THAT

00:43:58.503 --> 00:44:02.840 region:rollup2
HELPS AUGMENT THE SYSTEM AND

00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:05.576 region:rollup2
THEN THE ABILITY THROUGH GRANTS.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.810 region:rollup2

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:06.611 region:rollup2
WHERE?

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.045 region:rollup2
?

00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:09.714 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE PERSONNEL

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:11.282 region:rollup2
CAN ENHANCE THEIR.

00:44:09.714 --> 00:44:12.450 region:rollup2
THERE RIGHT RESOURCE

00:44:11.282 --> 00:44:13.885 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES THAT THERE'S A

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.052 region:rollup2
WHOLE VARIETY OF AREAS THAT I

00:44:13.885 --> 00:44:16.153 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:17.021 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD WITH

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:18.856 region:rollup2
LAST QUESTION.

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:20.158 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THE INCIDENT COMMAND

00:44:18.856 --> 00:44:22.894 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE?

00:44:20.158 --> 00:44:25.196 region:rollup2
A CHANGES OUTSIDE RESOURCES ARE

00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:27.131 region:rollup2
BROUGHT IN AND OTHER WORDS.

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:27.632 region:rollup2
S. THING SHIFT YOU HAVE MORE

00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:30.301 region:rollup2
MORE ENTITIES COMING AND

00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:32.303 region:rollup2
HELPING.

00:44:30.301 --> 00:44:33.804 region:rollup2
US WHO WHO'S IN CHARGE AND HOW

00:44:32.303 --> 00:44:35.072 region:rollup2
DOES IT WORK AT THAT POINT.

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:36.140 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:37.608 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE AGAIN CALIFORNIA

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:39.544 region:rollup2
WAS THE LEADER IN THIS IN

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:41.145 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SEVENTY AFTER WE HAD A

00:44:39.544 --> 00:44:43.814 region:rollup2
DECADE A VERY DODD DAMAGING

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:45.550 region:rollup2
FIRES AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:47.418 region:rollup2
UNDEVELOPED FIRE SCOPE ABOUT

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:48.686 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES. FOR OF

00:44:47.418 --> 00:44:51.656 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ORGANIZED FOR

00:44:48.686 --> 00:44:52.657 region:rollup2
EMERGENCIES BECAUSE WITH THAT.

00:44:51.656 --> 00:44:54.225 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT RADIO FREQUENCIES

00:44:52.657 --> 00:44:55.326 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT HOSE FITTINGS

00:44:54.225 --> 00:44:56.861 region:rollup2
WE WERE AND WE'VE HAD THREE

00:44:55.326 --> 00:44:58.229 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:59.897 region:rollup2
FIGHTING THE SAME FIRE NOT EVEN

00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:01.265 region:rollup2
TALKING TO EACH OTHER NO COMMAND

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:02.533 region:rollup2
WHATSOEVER. SO THE INCIDENT

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:03.734 region:rollup2
COMMAND SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:05.436 region:rollup2
WHICH IS NOW BEEN ADOPTED

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:06.971 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY WHO DOESN'T MATTER

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:08.339 region:rollup2
WHETHER RESOURCES COMING IN FROM

OR QUITE FRANKLY FROM AUSTRALIA.

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:13.578 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MANY MANY COUNTRIES ARE

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:15.546 region:rollup2
ARE BUYING INTO THE SYSTEM AS

00:45:13.578 --> 00:45:17.615 region:rollup2
WELL OF THIS JURISDICTIONS

IT CAN BE MANY.

00:45:23.254 --> 00:45:26.757 region:rollup2
THE CASE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:28.726 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE RESPONSIBILITIES WITHIN

00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:30.494 region:rollup2

URISDICTIONS PROVIDING

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:57.255 region:rollup2

IT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX.

00:46:43.234 --> 00:46:46.203 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A CAL FIRE A STATE

00:46:44.335 --> 00:46:47.972 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY VERY INCIDENT WE

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:49.774 region:rollup2
WILL CONFER AND MAKE A DECISION

00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:51.475 region:rollup2
IF IT'S GOING TO BECOME. A MORE

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:52.843 region:rollup2
COMPLEX TO BRING IN AN INCIDENT

PART OF THAT.

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:05.656 region:rollup2
AND THAT COULD THEN TEAM UP

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:08.459 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:09.327 region:rollup2

JURISDICTION WAS INVOLVED IN SO

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:23.641 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE IT'S A CAL FIRE

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:24.942 region:rollup2
TEAM DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE

00:47:23.641 --> 00:47:27.511 region:rollup2
OTHER INCIDENT COMMANDERS THAT

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:28.779 region:rollup2

00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:22.099 region:rollup2
WANTED TO.

00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:23.134 region:rollup2
THANK THE CHAIR OF FOR PUTTING

TOGETHER.

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.170 region:rollup2
AND.

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:27.738 region:rollup2
.

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.473 region:rollup2
AS HOPE THAT LAST YEAR'S

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:31.242 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING FIRES.

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:32.877 region:rollup2
WHERE AN ANOMALY AND THAT WE

00:48:31.242 --> 00:48:34.478 region:rollup2
NEVER SEE THOUSANDS OF HOMES

00:48:32.877 --> 00:48:36.080 region:rollup2
BURNED TO THE GROUND?

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:37.982 region:rollup2
I WOULD NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.283 region:rollup2
SO MUCH LOS.

00:48:37.982 --> 00:48:41.085 region:rollup2
AND SO MANY FAMILIES DISPLACED

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:42.853 region:rollup2
EVER AGAIN.

00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:44.355 region:rollup2
BUT THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT WE

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:45.923 region:rollup2
NEED BETTER FORCE MANAGEMENT OR

00:48:44.355 --> 00:48:47.391 region:rollup2
WE WILL SEE A REPEAT OF LAST

00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:49.226 region:rollup2
YEAR'S RUINOUS WILDFIRES ARE

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:51.362 region:rollup2
FORCE ARE CLOGGED.

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:53.197 region:rollup2
DECADES OF NEGLECT WITH MILLIONS

00:48:51.362 --> 00:48:54.932 region:rollup2
OF ACRES COVERED WITH THICK

00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:57.101 region:rollup2
LAYERS OF TENDER. JUST WAITING

00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:58.135 region:rollup2
TO EXPLODE.

00:48:57.101 --> 00:49:00.438 region:rollup2
BUT THE TREATMENT MORTALITY

00:48:58.135 --> 00:49:01.839 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:03.507 region:rollup2
ARE BALLPARK PROBLEMS ARE LIKELY

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:04.708 region:rollup2
TO GET WORSE.

00:49:03.507 --> 00:49:06.644 region:rollup2
UNLESS WE CAN UNDERTAKE A

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:08.446 region:rollup2
MASSIVE FORCE CLEARING PROJECT

00:49:06.644 --> 00:49:09.680 region:rollup2
WILL ROB THESE FIRES. OF THE

00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:11.382 region:rollup2
FUEL THEY NEED TO DEVASTATE

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.083 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BETTER FORCE

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:14.785 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT ALSO LEAST MORE

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:16.253 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE WATERSHEDS.

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:18.022 region:rollup2
WHICH HELPS IN TIMES OF DROUGHT

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:19.557 region:rollup2
AND CAN HELP SUPPORT A THRIVING

00:49:18.022 --> 00:49:21.559 region:rollup2
BIOMASS SECTOR.

00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:23.627 region:rollup2
IN OUR STATE.

00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:26.030 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD HELP GIVE VALUE TO

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:26.564 region:rollup2
THE FORCE WAIT. WASTE AND CREATE

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:28.065 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THEIR

00:49:26.564 --> 00:49:29.533 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:31.035 region:rollup2
FOR THE TIMBER INDUSTRIES PINK

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:32.536 region:rollup2
CRIPPLED BY OVER ZEALOUS

00:49:31.035 --> 00:49:34.038 region:rollup2
REGULATION.

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:35.606 region:rollup2
ALL THAT WOULD MITIGATE OUR

00:49:34.038 --> 00:49:36.807 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS BUT NOT ELIMINATE AT

00:49:35.606 --> 00:49:39.009 region:rollup2
THEM SO TODAY'S HEARING IS OF

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:40.644 region:rollup2
GREAT VALUE.

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:43.247 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I WANT TO RECOGNIZE

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:44.915 region:rollup2
OUR BRAVE FIRST RESPONDERS.

00:49:43.247 --> 00:49:47.084 region:rollup2
HE'S TRAINING TIRELESS WORK AN

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:49.019 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLE BRAVERY TRULY MAKE

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:50.754 region:rollup2
THEM LIFESAVING HEROES.

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:52.623 region:rollup2
WE ALL OWE THEM OUR DEEPEST

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:53.757 region:rollup2
GRATITUDE.

00:49:52.623 --> 00:49:55.392 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:58.495 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THEM INCREASE THEIR

00:49:55.392 --> 00:50:00.865 region:rollup2
SAFETY DURING THESE CRISES.

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:03.234 region:rollup2
REGARDING NEXT STEPS ARE HOWEVER

00:50:00.865 --> 00:50:05.102 region:rollup2
WE INCORPORATING BIOMASS INTO

00:50:03.234 --> 00:50:10.708 region:rollup2
OUR NEW MORE FORCE MANAGEMENT

00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:12.409 region:rollup2
PLANS.

00:50:10.708 --> 00:50:14.812 region:rollup2
SO ABOUT BIOMASS IS OBVIOUSLY

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:15.646 region:rollup2
ONE PIECE OF THE THE BIGGER.

00:50:14.812 --> 00:50:16.780 region:rollup2
TRY.

00:50:15.646 --> 00:50:18.749 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION TO BRING

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:21.352 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BACK TO OUR FORCE

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:24.321 region:rollup2
DID COMMUNITIES SO THAT WE HAVE.

00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:25.556 region:rollup2
MEASURES IN PLACE TO TREAT THIS

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:27.157 region:rollup2
THE VEGETATION AS YOU DISCUSS

00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:28.926 region:rollup2
AND AND AND.

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:30.461 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A COMPLEX ISSUE.

00:50:28.926 --> 00:50:32.630 region:rollup2
BECAUSE BIOMASS OBVIOUSLY

00:50:30.461 --> 00:50:34.832 region:rollup2
REQUIRES BY BRINGING IT TO A

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:36.734 region:rollup2
FACILITY. CO GENERATION.

00:50:34.832 --> 00:50:38.302 region:rollup2
EITHER HEAT OR ELECTRICITY AND

00:50:36.734 --> 00:50:39.336 region:rollup2
OF COURSE THERE NEEDS TO BE THE

00:50:38.302 --> 00:50:41.705 region:rollup2
PROCUREMENT ABOUT IF SOMEONE TO

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:43.374 region:rollup2
BUY THAT ELECTRICITY OBVIOUSLY A

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:44.208 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLEX SITUATION.

00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:45.776 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S CRITICAL AND IT'S ONE

00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:47.978 region:rollup2
OF THE KEY COMPONENTS FOR GOING

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:49.947 region:rollup2
TO STEP UP OUR GAME AND

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:51.215 region:rollup2
REINVESTING MANAGING ARE FORCED

00:50:49.947 --> 00:50:53.584 region:rollup2
TO NOT ONLY REDUCE THE THREAT

00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:55.553 region:rollup2
FROM FIRE. BUT ALL INCREASE THE

00:50:53.584 --> 00:50:57.221 region:rollup2
FORCED HEALTH SO WE DON'T HAVE A

00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:59.256 region:rollup2
EPIDEMIC LEVELS OF INSECTA

00:50:57.221 --> 00:51:00.491 region:rollup2
OUTBREAK BOB INFRASTRUCTURE IS

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:02.092 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE KEY AND AND NOT JUST

00:51:00.491 --> 00:51:04.929 region:rollup2
BIOMASS BUT YOU KNOW I THE

00:51:02.092 --> 00:51:08.132 region:rollup2
ENTIRE. WOOD PROCESSING OF SWEET

00:51:04.929 --> 00:51:09.700 region:rollup2
OF OF INDUSTRY FROM FROM LUMBER

00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:10.868 region:rollup2
TO OTHER PRODUCTS.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.603 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL WE HAVE WE

00:51:10.868 --> 00:51:14.271 region:rollup2
CAN USE ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET

00:51:12.603 --> 00:51:16.240 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK ON IT

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:18.008 region:rollup2
SINCE I WAS ELECTED IN OH SEVEN.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.809 region:rollup2
AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED SO I'M

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:20.377 region:rollup2
HOPING THAT WE CAN GET

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:22.580 region:rollup2
COOPERATION ON A BIPARTISAN

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:24.248 region:rollup2
BASIS TO DO. WHAT WE NEED TO DO

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.849 region:rollup2
TO PROPERLY MANAGE OUR FORCE WE

00:51:24.248 --> 00:51:26.317 region:rollup2
HAD AN CORPS FIRING O. SEVEN THE

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:28.285 region:rollup2
TAHOE BASIN WE'RE VERY

00:51:26.317 --> 00:51:30.955 region:rollup2
FORTUNATE?

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:31.555 region:rollup2
BUT THE FIRES DIDN'T KCK UP AND

00:51:30.955 --> 00:51:32.823 region:rollup2
BASICALLY BURN THE WHOLE BASIN

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:35.559 region:rollup2
DOWN.

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:37.261 region:rollup2
WILL BE LOST WELL I SAY ONLY

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:38.595 region:rollup2
BUT WAS TWO AND FIFTY HOMES.

00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:40.998 region:rollup2
SO.

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:43.434 region:rollup2
I'M JUST HOPING THAT WE CAN GET

00:51:40.998 --> 00:51:44.535 region:rollup2

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:10.194 region:rollup2
HEARING JUST ON THAT AND

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:11.829 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AND POWER AND.

00:52:10.194 --> 00:52:13.430 region:rollup2
IT ALL SORTS OF IT AND WE WILL.

00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:14.598 region:rollup2
BRADFORD FOR THE PURPOSE OF WHAT

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.633 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING TODAY BECAUSE IT WE

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:19.370 region:rollup2
COULD WE COULD BE HERE.

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:20.204 region:rollup2
AND A LOTTA. CENTER MCGUIRE.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:22.373 region:rollup2
IF YOU SO MUCH SHERMAN DARDEN.

00:52:20.204 --> 00:52:24.108 region:rollup2
I.

00:52:22.373 --> 00:52:25.342 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

00:52:24.108 --> 00:52:26.710 region:rollup2
I WILL SPEAK FOR ALL OF US SO TO

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:28.579 region:rollup2
SPEAK FOR MYSELF I THINK THAT WE

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:29.480 region:rollup2
ARE FACING THIS NEW REALITY. AYE

00:52:28.579 --> 00:52:31.382 region:rollup2
IN OVER THE LAST THIRTY SIX

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.549 region:rollup2
MONTHS EVERY TIME WE SAY IT'S AN

00:52:31.382 --> 00:52:33.851 region:rollup2
ON PRESIDENT WHILE IN FIRE GETS

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:35.753 region:rollup2
WORSE.

00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:37.187 region:rollup2
WE THE BALLOT FIRE WHICH THEN IT

00:52:35.753 --> 00:52:39.189 region:rollup2
WHICH ECLIPSE THE OPEN HILLS

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:40.658 region:rollup2
FIRE. BUT WE THEN HAVE TO CLEAN

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.225 region:rollup2
FIRE LAKE COUNTY WITHIN AT THE

00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:43.427 region:rollup2
NORTH BAY A FIRE STORM WHICH

00:52:41.225 --> 00:52:45.863 region:rollup2
WAS.

00:52:43.427 --> 00:52:46.597 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE PALE BUT IN THE WE

00:52:45.863 --> 00:52:47.464 region:rollup2
ALSO THE THOMAS FIRE.

00:52:46.597 --> 00:52:48.499 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE NEED TO STOP

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:50.134 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT THIS IS

00:52:48.499 --> 00:52:51.869 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED AND PREPARE FOR

00:52:50.134 --> 00:52:53.937 region:rollup2
WHAT OUR NEW REALLY TRULY IS.

00:52:51.869 --> 00:52:55.139 region:rollup2
AND THERE WERE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:57.074 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ADVANCE ABOUT A DECADE

00:52:55.139 --> 00:52:58.676 region:rollup2
AGO VIA GOVERNOR'S BLUE RIBBON

00:52:57.074 --> 00:53:00.044 region:rollup2
COMMISSION NOT AND I'M HOPING

00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:00.678 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:53:00.044 --> 00:53:01.545 region:rollup2
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO

00:53:00.678 --> 00:53:03.414 region:rollup2
ADVANCE.

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:04.014 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION TO SOME OF THE

00:53:03.414 --> 00:53:05.716 region:rollup2
BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO THINK WE

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:07.785 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:08.852 region:rollup2
BOB WE'RE CONFRONTING OUR NEW

00:53:07.785 --> 00:53:10.988 region:rollup2
REALITY.

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:13.390 region:rollup2
WISH TWENTY CENTURY SOLUTIONS

00:53:10.988 --> 00:53:14.958 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WHEN WE ARE FACING IN

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:16.827 region:rollup2
THIS NEW NORMAL THE TWENTY FIRST

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:18.328 region:rollup2
CENTURY SO COUPLE OF ITEMS.

00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:20.864 region:rollup2
SEWING DISPATCH

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:22.866 region:rollup2
BUT SO IF WE'RE GONNA EXPAND

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:24.201 region:rollup2
CAPACITY WITHIN THE SYSTEM. A

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:27.271 region:rollup2
TRIGGERED A GEO DEI JUST

00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:28.739 region:rollup2
MENTIONED UPON YOU WE WENT OVER

00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:30.207 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL OF ENHANCING

00:53:28.739 --> 00:53:31.675 region:rollup2
MODERNIZING COMMUNICATION BUT A

00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:33.677 region:rollup2
POOR PUTTING. ADDITIONAL ENGINES

00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:34.611 region:rollup2
AND PERSONNEL AND SYSTEM OF THE

00:53:33.677 --> 00:53:35.913 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SIDE WE NEED TO

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:38.515 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THEY'RE ABLE TO GET.

00:53:35.913 --> 00:53:40.918 region:rollup2
TO AND FROM AYE QUICKLY AND

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:42.553 region:rollup2
EFFICIENTLY. AND IF CAO FIRE IS

00:53:40.918 --> 00:53:43.687 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE EQUIPPING ALL OF

00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:45.956 region:rollup2
THEIR ENGINES OVER THE NEXT

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:47.624 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX MONTHS. OF WAY IF

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:48.726 region:rollup2
TRACKING EQUIPMENT LOCAL

00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:50.661 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT NEEDS DIDN'T NEED TO

00:53:48.726 --> 00:53:53.630 region:rollup2
DO THE TO DO THE SAME SO TALK

00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:54.565 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT SO THAT ONE TEAM ONE

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:57.801 region:rollup2
FIGHT WHICH I LOVE IN YOUR APPS.

00:53:54.565 --> 00:53:59.870 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE EQUIP? THAT WHOLE

00:53:57.801 --> 00:54:01.505 region:rollup2
TEAM WITH THE SAME EQUIPMENT SO

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.473 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IS DOING THE SAME THING

00:54:01.505 --> 00:54:04.074 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU ARE

00:54:02.473 --> 00:54:05.476 region:rollup2
TIRED TOUCH BACK DISPATCH AND

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:06.310 region:rollup2
TRACKING.

00:54:05.476 --> 00:54:08.479 region:rollup2
BOB I MEAN.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:10.681 region:rollup2
EUROPE CORRECT.

00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:12.683 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT IF THIS IS A.

00:54:10.681 --> 00:54:14.351 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PURCHASE A HOLISTIC

00:54:12.683 --> 00:54:15.919 region:rollup2
VIEW IT'S NOT JUST ENGINES IT'S

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:18.355 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST.

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:21.225 region:rollup2
OR FIREFIGHTERS IT'S IT'S ARE

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:24.628 region:rollup2
HAVING A CAPACITY WITHIN OUR.

00:54:21.225 --> 00:54:26.764 region:rollup2
OUR DISPATCHERS IT'S IT'S IT'S

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:28.432 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW BEING. BOB OF MAKING

00:54:26.764 --> 00:54:30.868 region:rollup2
SURE THAT OUR COMMAND CENTERS

00:54:28.432 --> 00:54:33.904 region:rollup2
ARE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE

00:54:30.868 --> 00:54:35.839 region:rollup2
THE SAME SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

00:54:33.904 --> 00:54:37.875 region:rollup2
TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:40.210 region:rollup2
CUTTING EDGE I THINK IF IF IF

00:54:37.875 --> 00:54:42.479 region:rollup2
ANYTHING. ELSE REQUIRES CUTTING

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:42.980 region:rollup2
EDGE TECHNOLOGY IT'S GOTTA BE

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:43.881 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.249 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

00:54:43.881 --> 00:54:47.317 region:rollup2
AND.

00:54:45.249 --> 00:54:49.186 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ALSO NOT

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:50.454 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY COME OUT WHICH HOLD

00:54:49.186 --> 00:54:52.489 region:rollup2
THE OTHER HEARING I'M SURE.

00:54:50.454 --> 00:54:54.591 region:rollup2
EXPANDING.

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:57.561 region:rollup2
NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE IN

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:59.463 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA EXPANDING OUR OUR AND

00:54:57.561 --> 00:55:02.032 region:rollup2
UP AND UP UP REPEATING THE

00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:03.133 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:04.768 region:rollup2
BACKBONE THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT.

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:06.003 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S FORTY SOMETHING

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:08.138 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD AND AND.

00:55:06.003 --> 00:55:09.506 region:rollup2
IN SOME AREAS IT'S IT'S BEEN

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:11.041 region:rollup2
MODERNIZE IN SOME AREAS WERE

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:12.576 region:rollup2
STILL WORKING WITH THE. DUCT

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:15.312 region:rollup2
TAPE DIDN'T AND BALING WIRE AND

00:55:12.576 --> 00:55:15.879 region:rollup2
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:16.914 region:rollup2
APPROACH THIS IN A HOLISTIC

00:55:15.879 --> 00:55:17.714 region:rollup2
VIEW.

00:55:16.914 --> 00:55:19.783 region:rollup2
SENATOR AND.

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:21.685 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT IS NOT JUST

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:23.387 region:rollup2
GETTING THE PERSONNEL ARE ITS

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:24.588 region:rollup2
TRAINING THEM IT'S MAKING SURE

00:55:23.387 --> 00:55:25.489 region:rollup2
THEY UNDERSTAND.

00:55:24.588 --> 00:55:28.158 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:31.762 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE.

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:33.096 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH A NEW REALITY UP

00:55:31.762 --> 00:55:35.065 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO ENGAGING OUR PARTNERS

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:36.533 region:rollup2
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THERE IS

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:37.568 region:rollup2
SOME TREMENDOUS CAPABILITY.

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:40.470 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:37.568 --> 00:55:42.272 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE IN AND OUT OF

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.907 region:rollup2
THE EX CHIEF AND I HAVE BEEN

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:45.175 region:rollup2
BEEN TALKING WITH SOME. PRIVATE

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:47.411 region:rollup2
SECTOR COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:49.146 region:rollup2
HIGH LEVEL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

00:55:47.411 --> 00:55:50.714 region:rollup2
WITHOUT OUR CAPABILITIES FOR THE

00:55:49.146 --> 00:55:53.083 region:rollup2
MILITARY WERE TRYING TO USE

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:54.952 region:rollup2
MILITARY. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IT

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:55.986 region:rollup2
TO OUR ENVIRONMENT THESE ARE ALL

00:55:54.952 --> 00:55:57.654 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE THINGS THAT THAT

00:55:55.986 --> 00:55:59.389 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING ON THEY NEED MONEY

00:55:57.654 --> 00:56:00.691 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT AND THEY NEED OF

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:02.292 region:rollup2
FOCUS TO DO THAT AND.

00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:03.861 region:rollup2
AND LEADERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:06.463 region:rollup2
GET US THERE BUT I I BELIEVE

00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:07.965 region:rollup2
WE'RE ON THAT THAT TRACK AND AND

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:09.233 region:rollup2
WITH YOUR HELP.

00:56:07.965 --> 00:56:10.534 region:rollup2
AND JUST LAST TWO QUESTIONS MR

00:56:09.233 --> 00:56:12.069 region:rollup2
CHURNED UP FOR A DISCO IN THERE

00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:13.403 region:rollup2
I JUST WANTED MOMENT EYES A

00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:14.638 region:rollup2
CHAIR IN THE TRUMAN DID A HIGH

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:16.440 region:rollup2
IN THE BEGINNING TO SAY THANK

00:56:14.638 --> 00:56:18.108 region:rollup2
YOU TO TRIGGER DO CHEATING.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.509 region:rollup2
JAPAN WHAT UP PHENOMENAL

00:56:18.108 --> 00:56:20.711 region:rollup2
GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK ACT AND

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:21.845 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE'S CAN BE A LOT

00:56:20.711 --> 00:56:24.581 region:rollup2
OF WORK AHEAD IN PARTICULAR FOR

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:25.148 region:rollup2
TRIGGER DUTY IN THE CLEAN UP SO.

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:28.252 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU SO MUCH. TO BOTH

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:29.519 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:56:28.252 --> 00:56:30.921 region:rollup2
ON THE ISSUES.

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:32.623 region:rollup2
TWO LAST QUESTIONS ON

00:56:30.921 --> 00:56:34.124 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENTS.

00:56:32.623 --> 00:56:36.059 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO TRAINING ON THE

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:37.060 region:rollup2
GROUND.

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:38.128 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.730 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES IS TRYING TO BE ARE

00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:41.298 region:rollup2
TO GET THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.165 region:rollup2
REIMBURSES QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

00:56:41.298 --> 00:56:43.634 region:rollup2
BUT AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:45.068 region:rollup2
DEBTS IN ITEM THAT NEED TO BE

00:56:43.634 --> 00:56:47.471 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THROUGH LOOKING MUTUAL

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:49.606 region:rollup2
AID SYSTEM. IN THE OTHER ITEM IS

00:56:47.471 --> 00:56:52.542 region:rollup2
AND I'M.

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:53.744 region:rollup2
A LOOK AT IT AS A A RELATED ITEM

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:55.279 region:rollup2
YOU'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS

00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:56.613 region:rollup2
NEW REPORT THAT HAS. NOT COME

00:56:55.279 --> 00:56:58.248 region:rollup2
OUT SOME WITH SOME FINDINGS IN

00:56:56.613 --> 00:57:00.217 region:rollup2
REGARD TO THE COUNTY CINEMA AND

00:56:58.248 --> 00:57:01.385 region:rollup2
HAVING STANDARDIZED TRAINING ON

00:57:00.217 --> 00:57:03.720 region:rollup2
THE GROUND FOR THOSE EMERGENCY

00:57:01.385 --> 00:57:06.623 region:rollup2
MANAGERS AS WELL. WHETHER IT'S

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:07.124 region:rollup2
KNOWING. ABOUT THE LATEST ON THE

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:09.626 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT THAT THEY HAVE

00:57:07.124 --> 00:57:12.362 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE I'D TO MAKING SURE

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:13.964 region:rollup2
THAT THERE. IS A JOINT COMMAND

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:15.299 region:rollup2
IN THE BEGINNING IF YOU DON'T

00:57:13.964 --> 00:57:16.667 region:rollup2
MIND TOUCHING BASE ON THOSE TWO

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:18.468 region:rollup2
ITEMS IMMIGRANTS REIMBURSEMENTS

00:57:16.667 --> 00:57:21.672 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEN THAT.

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:22.172 region:rollup2
I. NEED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:57:21.672 --> 00:57:24.074 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY FOR EMERGENCY

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:25.175 region:rollup2
MANAGERS.

00:57:24.074 --> 00:57:27.311 region:rollup2
WELL.

00:57:25.175 --> 00:57:28.578 region:rollup2
ON THE FARM.

00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:30.147 region:rollup2
ON THE CASE A REIMBURSEMENT I

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:31.715 region:rollup2
MEAN REIMBURSEMENTS ALWAYS.

00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:33.550 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE.

00:57:31.715 --> 00:57:35.619 region:rollup2
.

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:36.153 region:rollup2
STRIVE IN BUT ALL THIS COMES

00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:37.421 region:rollup2
THROUGH WE ASKED AND AND.

00:57:36.153 --> 00:57:37.688 region:rollup2
.

00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:39.957 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

00:57:37.688 --> 00:57:41.591 region:rollup2
CONTINUALLY WORK TO.

ACCELERATE THE PACE AT WHICH

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:50.067 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENTS ARE MADE.

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:52.569 region:rollup2
RECENTLY WE'VE WE'VE IN AND.

00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:55.072 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN A MUCH MORE.

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:56.807 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN CAPABILITY TO

00:57:55.072 --> 00:57:58.642 region:rollup2
DO THAT. ARM.

00:57:56.807 --> 00:57:58.909 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT THAT THERE IS STILL A

00:57:58.642 --> 00:58:00.377 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF.

00:57:58.909 --> 00:58:02.012 region:rollup2
.

00:58:00.377 --> 00:58:03.914 region:rollup2
I WHAT I WOULD SAY OLD SCHOOL IN

00:58:02.012 --> 00:58:06.183 region:rollup2

00:58:06.183 --> 00:58:09.786 region:rollup2
THE END SAID THEY GO THROUGH

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:11.088 region:rollup2
DEMOBILIZATION WHAT'S THE GO TO

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:12.489 region:rollup2
DEMOBILIZATION THEY'VE GOTTA

00:58:11.088 --> 00:58:14.658 region:rollup2
FILL OUT WHAT WE CALL IN THAT

00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:17.160 region:rollup2
FORTY TWO IT'S A. HAND WRITTEN

PAPER WORK OUR. CHIEF OFFICERS

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.997 region:rollup2
ON THE GROUND ARE COORDINATING

00:58:18.028 --> 00:58:22.032 region:rollup2
THIS BELT OUT PAPERWORK IT'S

00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:22.599 region:rollup2
BROUGHT BACK INTO A WE ASKED WE

00:58:22.032 --> 00:58:23.633 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH IT AND YOU TO GET

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:25.068 region:rollup2
ALL.

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:27.571 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE AREA THAT NEEDS TO

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:29.506 region:rollup2
BE STREAMLINED.

00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:30.374 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:30.841 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINE SERIES THERE

00:58:30.374 --> 00:58:32.509 region:rollup2
HASN'T BEEN.

00:58:30.841 --> 00:58:33.577 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T FUNDING TO DO THAT

00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:35.679 region:rollup2
AND AND AND THE AND THE EMPHASIS

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:37.848 region:rollup2
BUT. THAT'S ONE AREA TO

00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:39.816 region:rollup2
ACCELERATE THE PACE THAT WE GET

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:41.017 region:rollup2
PEOPLE PAID NOW.

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:42.519 region:rollup2
I'M BALLOTS WITH THE SAY THAT

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:43.286 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S JUST UPS SHOT OUT TO

00:58:42.519 --> 00:58:44.688 region:rollup2
THE CREW THAT'S WORKING ON THIS

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:46.857 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT. THE FOLKS AT A WE

00:58:44.688 --> 00:58:48.091 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO REIMBURSEMENT OUR WAY

00:58:46.857 --> 00:58:49.960 region:rollup2
TO WORKING NIGHT AND DAY IN AND

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:51.528 region:rollup2
THEY PAY DAY TRIED XCELERATED

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:53.530 region:rollup2
MANY PAYMENTS AS THEY. POSSIBLY

00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:55.132 region:rollup2
CAN NOW NOT ALL PAYMENTS ALSO

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:56.800 region:rollup2
COME THROUGH THROUGH THE STATE

00:58:55.132 --> 00:58:58.668 region:rollup2
THERE ARE FEDERAL. PAYMENTS AND

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.070 region:rollup2
THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER CASE THAT

00:58:58.668 --> 00:59:01.538 region:rollup2
I THINK WE COULD TALK ABOUT

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:04.141 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU GOT DIFFERENT PEOPLE

00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:06.309 region:rollup2
PLAYERS ARE UP PAYING. OUR

00:59:04.141 --> 00:59:07.377 region:rollup2
BIGGEST PAPERBACK SENATOR DODD'S

00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:10.814 region:rollup2
QUESTION HERB SENATOR JACKSCREWS

00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:11.014 region:rollup2
XIN WHO WHERE THE FUNDING COME

00:59:10.814 --> 00:59:11.581 region:rollup2
FROM.

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:13.450 region:rollup2
.

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:15.519 region:rollup2
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT.

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:18.188 region:rollup2
THEY'RE EASIER THIS IS ONE AREA

00:59:15.519 --> 00:59:20.791 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S STILL IN SOME WAYS

00:59:18.188 --> 00:59:23.226 region:rollup2
ARE OLD SCHOOL AND THEY CAN BE I

00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:24.694 region:rollup2
IMPROVE ON THE CASE OF.

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:25.562 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT JUST EMERGENCY

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:27.931 region:rollup2
MANAGERS LIKE I THINK.

00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:28.665 region:rollup2
.

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:30.634 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:32.536 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE LOOK ALL

00:59:30.634 --> 00:59:33.904 region:rollup2
DISASTERS ARE LOCAL BASED THEY

00:59:32.536 --> 00:59:35.038 region:rollup2
START THEIR.

00:59:33.904 --> 00:59:36.740 region:rollup2
AND THEY AND THEIR.

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:38.141 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS THE STATE COMES IN

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.743 region:rollup2
AND ALL OF US GET IMPACTED THE

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:41.645 region:rollup2
ECONOMY THE STATE GETS IMPACTED

00:59:39.743 --> 00:59:42.813 region:rollup2
OUR RESEARCH GET ACTED.

00:59:41.645 --> 00:59:44.181 region:rollup2
DISASTERS HAPPEN WHERE PEOPLE

00:59:42.813 --> 00:59:46.183 region:rollup2
LIVE THEY GO TO CHURCH TO GO TO

00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:47.084 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ALL OF THESE THINGS AND

00:59:46.183 --> 00:59:48.385 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO TAKE OUT AND ACT

00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:50.487 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

00:59:48.385 --> 00:59:52.389 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OVERALL NEED

00:59:50.487 --> 00:59:54.024 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A NEW

00:59:52.389 --> 00:59:56.593 region:rollup2
NORM.

00:59:54.024 --> 00:59:58.395 region:rollup2
ARM YOUR LOCAL ELECTED BODIES

00:59:56.593 --> 01:00:00.130 region:rollup2
YOUR EMERGENCY MANAGERS PERSONAL

00:59:58.395 --> 01:00:01.298 region:rollup2
PUTTING EMPHASIS ON EMERGENCY

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:03.333 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT WOULD BE A GREAT STEP

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:04.668 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND THAT'S A.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:06.870 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS IT'S BEEN HIT AND

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:08.538 region:rollup2
MISS AS TO HOW MUCH EMPHASIS IS

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:09.573 region:rollup2
PLACED ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:11.141 region:rollup2
BUT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT REALLY

01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:12.843 region:rollup2
TOUCHES A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:14.544 region:rollup2
AS YOU'VE ALL EXPERIENCED IN

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:16.279 region:rollup2
THIS RECENT SET OF FIRES.

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:18.081 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE RESPONSE IF

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:20.584 region:rollup2
THE RECOVERY AND ALL THE SOCIAL

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:22.052 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND AS I SAY OFTEN THE

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:23.820 region:rollup2
ACHILLES HEEL WITH ANY OF THESE

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:25.555 region:rollup2
EVENTS IS REALLY THE RECOVERY.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:27.657 region:rollup2
SO WHILE WE RESPONDING IN USING

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:29.659 region:rollup2
THAT MUTUAL AID CAPABILITY TO

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:31.128 region:rollup2
PUT THE FIRES OUT. BESSIE

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:33.563 region:rollup2
MUTUALLY CAPABILITY TO TO SOME

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:34.764 region:rollup2
LEVEL IS USED TO DO THE RECOVERY

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.966 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.767 region:rollup2
THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH A

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.668 region:rollup2
STRONG LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AND

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:40.270 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS THAT YOUR LOCAL

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:41.605 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY MANAGERS YOUR LOCAL

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.140 region:rollup2
FIRE CHIEF YOUR LOCAL POLICE

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:45.275 region:rollup2
CHIEFS. NEED TO BE COORDINATED

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.676 region:rollup2
THAT NEED TO BE WELL TRADE AND

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:48.011 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO STEPS INTO THE WHOLE

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:50.113 region:rollup2
THING ABOUT.

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:52.549 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:54.050 region:rollup2
ASKED OF. AGAIN BRAGGING TO IT'S

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:55.719 region:rollup2
OFF TOPIC LAND USE PLANNING

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.653 region:rollup2
WHERE WE SEEING THE CURRENT

01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:58.321 region:rollup2
THREATS.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:01:00.423 region:rollup2
DEPEND WHAT I TALK ABOUT THIS A

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:02.826 region:rollup2
LOT BECAUSE IT DOES PLAY INTO

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:04.794 region:rollup2
HOW WE DO RESOURCE ALLOCATION.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:07.030 region:rollup2
HAS TO WHAT ARE THE THREAT ZONES

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:08.765 region:rollup2
IN COMMUNITIES AND AND AND.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.500 region:rollup2
EACH COMMUNITIES REQUIRED HAS A

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:12.302 region:rollup2
HOUSE A MITIGATION PLAN THAT'S

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.436 region:rollup2
PART OF THE GENERAL PLAN AND

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:14.738 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED AND

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:16.673 region:rollup2
THAT HAS A MITIGATION PLAN

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:18.074 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A DRIVING FACTOR. HAS

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:19.576 region:rollup2
TO ONE OF THE POTENTIAL

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:22.445 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT COMMUNITY CAN

01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:25.148 region:rollup2

SCIENCE BEHIND THAT WHAT IS THAT

WITHIN TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:46.936 region:rollup2
HOURS WE START TO RESOURCES. I

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:48.972 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THAT FIRST OPERATIONAL

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:50.073 region:rollup2
BRIEFING THERE WAS I LOOKED OUT

01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:51.174 region:rollup2

HERE AND WERE ABLE TO DO WORK

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.685 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHERE THE VALUE OF

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:04.087 region:rollup2
THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM COMES AND.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.088 region:rollup2

RESOURCES IN THERE AND REALLY

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:18.535 region:rollup2

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:37.914 region:rollup2
THREE ENGINES SO WHEN YOU TALK

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:39.916 region:rollup2
ABOUT. OF WHAT. THE FIRE FOLKS

01:08:37.914 --> 01:08:42.085 region:rollup2
DID IN THAT AREA. IN HOW THEY

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:44.887 region:rollup2
RESPONDED THERE WASN'T A LOT OF.

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:46.956 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO EXTRA CAPACITY

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:48.157 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN EVACUATE AND JUST TRY

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.559 region:rollup2
TO GET AHEAD OF THIS FIRE COULD

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:51.160 region:rollup2

SENATOR DODD SENATOR JACKSON'S

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:11.107 region:rollup2

AND.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:18.214 region:rollup2
IT CHIEF CUSTOMERS RIGHT THIS

01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:19.148 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WORKS PRETTY WELL AFTER

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.750 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:22.318 region:rollup2
THE REAL CHALLENGES IT IS DURING

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.953 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL THE INITIAL ATTACK

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:25.088 region:rollup2
STAGES SO I'M GONNA.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.589 region:rollup2
SHARE WITH YOU MY EXPERIENCE A

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:27.957 region:rollup2
MENTOR COUNTY ENSURE A LITTLE

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:29.525 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT WHAT RIGHT LOOKS LIKE

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:31.027 region:rollup2
IN.

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:32.929 region:rollup2
THE REASON I SAY THAT IS AT THE

01:10:31.027 --> 01:10:34.997 region:rollup2
FIRE THE THOMAS FIRE WHICH

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:37.433 region:rollup2
STARTED ON DECEMBER FOURTH OF

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:38.668 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:40.136 region:rollup2
I COULD I COULD HAVE OCCURRED IN

01:10:38.668 --> 01:10:41.904 region:rollup2
A MORE PREPARED COMMUNITY YOU

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:43.039 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE ACTIONS THAT WE'VE

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.841 region:rollup2
TAKEN IN ADVANCE WE HAVE.

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:46.843 region:rollup2
.

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:47.710 region:rollup2
I'D A DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAM

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:48.177 region:rollup2
WITH A HUNDRED FOOT CLEARANCE

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:49.879 region:rollup2
ITS SECOND A NINE IT'S

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:52.748 region:rollup2
MANDATORY.

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:54.250 region:rollup2
IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE WE HAVE.

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:56.018 region:rollup2
A READY SET GO PROGRAM TO

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.753 region:rollup2
PREPARE AKIN UNITY. AND THEN WE

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:59.388 region:rollup2
ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY WHEN WE

01:10:57.753 --> 01:11:00.723 region:rollup2
SEE FIRE WEATHER COMING WE HAVE

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:02.191 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO STAND UP

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:03.493 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND PRE POSITION THEM

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:03.993 region:rollup2
AND WE DID THAT ON THE DAY OF

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:05.928 region:rollup2
THE THOMAS FIRE AND THAT

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:07.463 region:rollup2
MORNING.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:08.631 region:rollup2
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN DECEMBER

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:10.299 region:rollup2
FOURTH WE STOOD UP ADDITIONAL

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:12.335 region:rollup2
RATE RESOURCES THAT WERE EIGHTY

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:14.370 region:rollup2
SEVEN PERCENT OVER OUR REGULAR

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:15.972 region:rollup2
DAILY STAFFING. THAT'S FIRE

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.406 region:rollup2
ENGINES ITS HAND CREWS IT'S AN

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:18.307 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL HELICOPTER AND

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:19.442 region:rollup2
PROBABLY JUST AS EQUALLY

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.643 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IT WAS ALSO

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:23.279 region:rollup2
DISPATCHERS IN OUR DISPATCH

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:24.814 region:rollup2
CENTER SO WE. HAD ANTICIPATED

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:26.048 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:27.750 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT'S UNIQUE WITH US IS

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:29.685 region:rollup2
THAT MOST OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:31.954 region:rollup2
FIRE AGENCIES CANNOT DO THIS

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:32.555 region:rollup2
THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT THEY

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.422 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:35.091 region:rollup2
IT.

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:36.559 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE LUXURY BECAUSE WE

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:38.161 region:rollup2
HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:39.762 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CAL

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:41.030 region:rollup2
FIRE. AND WE ARE A CONTRACT

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:42.498 region:rollup2
COUNTY ONE OF SIX COUNTIES IN

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:44.734 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:47.270 region:rollup2
AND SO ITS NORMAL FOR US TO PRE

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:48.437 region:rollup2
POSITION RESOURCES.

01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:50.039 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ALSO A NORMAL FOR US TO

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:51.407 region:rollup2
GET REIMBURSED FOR THAT MAJORITY

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:53.009 region:rollup2
OF THOSE THROUGH THE STATE OF

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:54.177 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IN THE E. FUND.

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:55.645 region:rollup2
LIKE I SAID MOST LOCAL

01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:57.380 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE THAT

01:11:55.645 --> 01:12:00.082 region:rollup2
LUXURY.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:02.418 region:rollup2
SO.

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:05.321 region:rollup2
SIX TWENTY PM THAT NIGHT THE

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:06.656 region:rollup2
FIRE OF ALL FIRES STARTED.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:07.790 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS THAT THE BEST THING

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.991 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.393 region:rollup2
ANSWER IS DID IT MAKE A

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:11.694 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE RIGHT DID STANDING UP

01:12:10.393 --> 01:12:12.762 region:rollup2
RESOURCES BY EIGHTY SEVEN

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:14.430 region:rollup2
PERCENT MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:15.865 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:16.732 region:rollup2
WHEN WE STAND UP RESOURCES OUR

01:12:15.865 --> 01:12:18.801 region:rollup2
INITIAL GOAL IS TO KEEP FIRE

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:20.236 region:rollup2
SMALL BUT ON THAT DAY WE HAD

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:21.904 region:rollup2
SIXTY MILE AN HOUR EAST WINDS

01:12:20.236 --> 01:12:24.006 region:rollup2
UNLIKE ANY WE'VE EVER SEEN WE

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:25.641 region:rollup2
HAD SIX YEARS OF DROUGHT IN OUR

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:27.543 region:rollup2
PART FEW BEDS ARE JUST

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:27.710 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY DEAD.

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.979 region:rollup2
AND.

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:32.114 region:rollup2
.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:34.083 region:rollup2
SO YES IT'S OUR OUR GOAL IS TO

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:36.052 region:rollup2
KEEP FIRE SMALL BUT WE RECOGNIZE

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:37.019 region:rollup2
ALSO THAT.

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:39.155 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T DO THAT IN EVERY

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:41.057 region:rollup2
INSTANCE AND SO. ON OCCASIONS

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:42.491 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS ONE WE HAVE TO CHANGE

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:44.293 region:rollup2
ARE PRIORITIES AND NORMALLY WHEN

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:45.728 region:rollup2
WE SEND FIRE ENGINES TO FIRE.

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:46.195 region:rollup2
THEIR INITIAL GOAL IS TO PUT A

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:47.730 region:rollup2
FILE A RING AROUND THE

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:49.298 region:rollup2
PERIMETER.

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.833 region:rollup2
IF WE HAVE IF WINDSOR TO

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:52.001 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ARE SECONDARY GOAL

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:53.736 region:rollup2
IS GENERALLY TO GO OUT AND

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:55.705 region:rollup2
DEFEND STRUCTURES IN THIS ONE

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:57.240 region:rollup2
WAS JUST UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:59.008 region:rollup2
WE'VE EVER SEEN IT TRAVELED.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.543 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN MILES IN THREE HOURS

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:03.045 region:rollup2
FROM SANTA PAULA INTO THE CITY

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:05.448 region:rollup2
OF VENTURA.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:07.416 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE SAW OUR RESOURCES

01:13:05.448 --> 01:13:08.551 region:rollup2
DOING WAS.

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:09.852 region:rollup2
NEITHER PRINTER CONTROL BOARD

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.587 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE DEFENSE WHAT THEY WERE

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:13.089 region:rollup2
REALLY DOING WAS ACTIVE RESCUES

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:14.223 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT GOES BACK TO DID WE

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:15.925 region:rollup2
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEAT WE

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:17.460 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DIDN'T PUT THAT FIRE

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:18.561 region:rollup2
OUT EARLY AND THERE WAS NO WAY

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.496 region:rollup2
FROM THE INITIAL IGNITION POINT

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.063 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE. EVER GONNA MAKE

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:22.365 region:rollup2
ANY KIND OF HEADWAY ON THAT

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.532 region:rollup2
FIRE.

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:24.967 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE FACT

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:26.903 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE PRE POSITIONED

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:28.437 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND STRIKE TEAMS WE

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:30.139 region:rollup2
HAD ONE SMALL A RURAL COMMUNITY

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:31.941 region:rollup2
CALLED WHEELER CANYON THE FIRE

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:33.142 region:rollup2
WAS IN THERE WITHIN AN HOUR.

01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:34.377 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WE HAD IN THERE

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:35.311 region:rollup2
WITH AN HOUR WE HAD A FULL

01:13:34.377 --> 01:13:37.013 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT TEAM OF ENGINES UP

01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:38.281 region:rollup2
THERE. INITIALLY GOING UP TO

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:40.449 region:rollup2
PROTECT THAT COMMUNITY IN

01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:41.817 region:rollup2
DEFENSE STRUCTURES WHAT HAPPENED

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:42.852 region:rollup2
AS AS A.

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:44.353 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WAS

01:13:42.852 --> 01:13:46.455 region:rollup2
EVACUATING.

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:47.523 region:rollup2
SHE CRASHED HER CAR AND AND

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:49.392 region:rollup2
ENDED UP BEING BURNED OVER AND

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:50.927 region:rollup2
DYING AND ENDED UP TRAPPING

01:13:49.392 --> 01:13:52.995 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ANOTHER FIFTEEN CARS

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:53.629 region:rollup2
BEHIND HER AND SO WHAT ARE FIRE

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:55.865 region:rollup2
ENGINES THAT WERE IN THERE DID

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:57.533 region:rollup2
IS THEY. SHIFTED INTO ACTIVE

01:13:55.865 --> 01:14:00.870 region:rollup2
RESCUE MODE.

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:02.738 region:rollup2
AND THEY WENT DOWN TO.

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:04.006 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WHO IS STUCK IN THERE

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:05.107 region:rollup2
AND ABOUT TO BE OVERRUN AND IT

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:06.542 region:rollup2
WAS IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A A

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.610 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN DRILL EXERCISE THEY

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.611 region:rollup2
PULLED OUT ONE OF THE ROPES OFF

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:11.647 region:rollup2
THE ENGINE.

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:12.949 region:rollup2
THEY HAD ALL OF THE CITIZENS

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:13.549 region:rollup2
EVACUATE OTHER VEHICLES AND HOLD

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.184 region:rollup2
ONTO THE ROPE AND THERE WERE

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:19.055 region:rollup2
ZERO VISIBILITY. AND THEY LED

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:20.623 region:rollup2
THEM TO SAFETY UP IN A.

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:22.825 region:rollup2
A CORRAL THAT WAS JUST A PASSED

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:24.727 region:rollup2
THE ROADWAY.

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:26.362 region:rollup2
SO THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE AS IT

01:14:24.727 --> 01:14:28.531 region:rollup2
IS MY GUESS IS THAT A NUMBER OF

01:14:26.362 --> 01:14:30.466 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PERISHED

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:32.268 region:rollup2
HAD WE NOT HAD. PRE POSITIONED

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:34.403 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IN THEIR EARLY TO DEAL

01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:34.971 region:rollup2

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:38.240 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENED THERE WHEELER

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:40.609 region:rollup2
CANWEST'S WAS ALSO TRUE. IN THE

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.277 region:rollup2
CITY OF VENTURA THAT WAS HIT.

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.378 region:rollup2
I AM WITH A GIANT WALL OF FIRE

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:44.814 region:rollup2
THREE HOURS LATER AND WE HAD

01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:45.981 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IN THEIR.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.717 region:rollup2
BOTH FROM PRE POSITIONING AND

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:50.119 region:rollup2
ALSO.

01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:51.821 region:rollup2

THEY DIDN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:59.028 region:rollup2

POSITION UP TO US.

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:03.933 region:rollup2

01:15:01.764 --> 01:15:05.368 region:rollup2
CITY OF INTERMITTENT TIME TO

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:07.370 region:rollup2
HELP PROTECT SOME OF THE

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:07.970 region:rollup2

ANYTHING HE HAD SEEN AND THEY

01:15:16.746 --> 01:15:19.015 region:rollup2
STARTED.

ON THROUGH THESE HEARINGS HERE

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:14.437 region:rollup2
IS OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN SOME

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:14.970 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WE HAVEN'T ORDERING

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:16.472 region:rollup2
AND IT'S INTERESTING WE'RE

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:18.340 region:rollup2
PRETTY WELL PRACTICED IN VENTURA

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:19.875 region:rollup2
COUNTY WE'VE EXPERIENCED.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.776 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DELAYS AND CHOKE

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.911 region:rollup2
POINTS IT A CORE OCCURRING ARE

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.745 region:rollup2
MUTUALLY ORDERING SYSTEM AND SO

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.379 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO IS.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.147 region:rollup2
WE GENERALLY DON'T WAIT FOR THE

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:25.948 region:rollup2
SYSTEM LIKE WE'VE.

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:27.116 region:rollup2
CHIEF CUSTER'S RT RECOGNIZES THE

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:28.417 region:rollup2
SYSTEM GETS.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:29.952 region:rollup2
IT'S PRETTY EFFECTIVE AFTER

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.720 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT DURING THE

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:32.822 region:rollup2
INITIAL ATTACK STAGES.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.757 region:rollup2
IT'S A CHALLENGES A CHALLENGE

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:36.258 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR DISPATCH CENTERS ARE

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:37.326 region:rollup2
OVERTAXED WITH CALLS COMING IN.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:38.861 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE TO PLACE THE

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:40.429 region:rollup2
ORDERS INTO THE ROSS SYSTEM THE

01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:41.697 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BY WHICH WE PLACE OUR

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:43.232 region:rollup2
ORDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:44.500 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO.

01:16:43.232 --> 01:16:46.001 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO IS WE'VE LEARNED OVER

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:48.170 region:rollup2
TIME THAT WE DON'T WAIT FOR THE

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:49.705 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO WORK I KNOW CHIEF OZ

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:51.040 region:rollup2
BE HAS RESOURCES IN CHIEF

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:52.675 region:rollup2
PROCESS WITH DALY CITY HAS

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.809 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND ERIC PETERSON AND

01:16:52.675 --> 01:16:54.910 region:rollup2
CHIEF MARDUK MARSHALL IN KERN

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:56.078 region:rollup2
COUNTY?

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:57.546 region:rollup2
AND SO WE PHONE A FRIEND AND WE

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:59.582 region:rollup2
WE GO OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEM

01:16:57.546 --> 01:17:01.350 region:rollup2
TEMPORARILY BECAUSE. WE KNOW WE

01:16:59.582 --> 01:17:02.651 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO IT RIGHT

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:04.487 region:rollup2
HERE AND NOW ITS WE MADE PHONE

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:06.255 region:rollup2
CALLS AND THEY SENT RESOURCES

01:17:04.487 --> 01:17:06.789 region:rollup2
AND WE GOT THEM INTO THAT.

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:07.590 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME SYSTEM

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:09.725 region:rollup2
LATER.

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:11.293 region:rollup2
.

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:12.394 region:rollup2
BUT I I THINK WHAT THAT DOES IS

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.596 region:rollup2
IT POINTS OUT THAT WE RECOGNIZE

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:15.264 region:rollup2
THAT THE SYSTEM IS GOOD BUT

01:17:13.596 --> 01:17:15.865 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:17.766 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE

01:17:15.865 --> 01:17:19.034 region:rollup2
MADE. WELL OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:21.337 region:rollup2
AND AS PRIDE NOT JUST

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:23.072 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL.

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:25.508 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE WERE FORTUNATE ON

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:27.376 region:rollup2
DECEMBER FOURTH. HAVE STAFFED UP

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:28.677 region:rollup2
IN OUR DISPATCH CENTER.

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:31.614 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A CRITICAL PART IN AND

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:33.716 region:rollup2
AND BY LUCK.

01:17:31.614 --> 01:17:36.085 region:rollup2
YEAH I'M THE THOMAS FIRE STARTED

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:37.219 region:rollup2
JUST BUT BEFORE SHIFT CHANGE FOR

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:38.387 region:rollup2
US OUR DISPATCH CENTER SO WE

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:39.922 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WERE DOUBLE STAFF

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:41.357 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T ALLOW ANYONE TO GO HOME

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:42.992 region:rollup2
AND WE WERE ALLOWED IN ABLE TO

01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:43.559 region:rollup2
PROCESS THOSE ORDERS THROUGH

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:45.361 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BUT STILL THE SYSTEM

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:47.630 region:rollup2
SLOW.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:49.298 region:rollup2
SO WE MAKE PHONE CALLS WE WE

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:50.1000 region:rollup2
WORK AROUND THE SYSTEM.

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:52.668 region:rollup2
SO THERE SUCCESS THERE AT THE

01:17:50.1000 --> 01:17:55.104 region:rollup2
PRE POSITIONING SUCH A POWERFUL

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:57.072 region:rollup2
TOOL IT IT ALLOWS US TO GET IN

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:58.674 region:rollup2
AND TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTIONS EARLY

01:17:57.072 --> 01:18:00.242 region:rollup2
ON AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:02.077 region:rollup2
TO SAVE EVERYTHING BUT. IT'S A

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:02.912 region:rollup2
IT'S A COMBINATION OF OF

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:04.013 region:rollup2
PREPARATION ADVANCE WITH YOUR

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:05.614 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN YOUR CONSTRUCTION

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:07.216 region:rollup2
YOUR DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND WE

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:09.885 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ACTIVE PRESCRIBED FIRE

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:10.519 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN OUR COUNTY TO. ITS A

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:11.620 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE THINGS

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:13.455 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:15.257 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IS IS REALLY WHERE

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:16.792 region:rollup2
CAPTAIN AND IT DOESN'T JUST

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:19.261 region:rollup2
APPLY THE WILDLAND FIRES.

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:19.929 region:rollup2
THIS CASE IN POINT.

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:22.331 region:rollup2
NOW THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MODESTY

01:18:19.929 --> 01:18:23.966 region:rollup2
OF TRAGEDY IN THE MUD FLOWS.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:25.968 region:rollup2
OH YES STAFFED UP SOME RESOURCES

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:27.836 region:rollup2
AS DID WE WERE ALL RISK WE

01:18:25.968 --> 01:18:29.338 region:rollup2
STAFFED UP. AND URBAN SEARCH AND

RESCUE TEAM AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.843 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.946 region:rollup2
CAN BE A LOCAL EMERGENCY. TURNED

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:38.747 region:rollup2
OUT IT WAS AN EMERGENCY JUST TO

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:40.282 region:rollup2
THE NORTH OF ASSN WE SENT ALL

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:42.451 region:rollup2
THOSE RESOURCES HAVE TO MANSIO.

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:44.753 region:rollup2
SO. BUT THE PREPRINT POSITION

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:45.955 region:rollup2
HAS SUCH INCREDIBLE POWER AND

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:48.023 region:rollup2
VALUE. AND IT'S.

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:50.092 region:rollup2
YEAH I WOULD SAY IT'S AN

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:51.994 region:rollup2
INSURANCE POLICY. IT'S EXPENSIVE

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:53.862 region:rollup2
BUT NOT NEARLY AS EXPENSIVE AS

01:18:51.994 --> 01:19:00.169 region:rollup2
THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT BEING

01:18:53.862 --> 01:19:03.172 region:rollup2

MY COLLEAGUES DID AND THAT IS

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:21.123 region:rollup2
THE PERSPECTIVE OF BEING A FIRE

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:22.858 region:rollup2
CHIEF IN CONTRAST TO COUNTY ONE

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:24.026 region:rollup2
OF THE EAST BAY. COUNTIES AND

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:26.395 region:rollup2
AND BEING RECOGNIZED AS A

01:19:24.026 --> 01:19:27.696 region:rollup2
RESOURCE RICH AREA THAT IS

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:29.932 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY DEPENDENT ON TO SEND

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:31.133 region:rollup2
RESOURCES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:34.036 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON WHERE THE FIRES

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:34.803 region:rollup2
WERE. IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:35.471 region:rollup2
.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:38.073 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO OFFER THAT

01:19:35.471 --> 01:19:39.675 region:rollup2
WE HAD RESOURCES STOOD UP RATE

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:41.577 region:rollup2
AGO WE RECOGNIZE VERY EARLY

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:42.945 region:rollup2
EARLY ON OUR OUR. OUR COMMANDERS

01:19:41.577 --> 01:19:45.080 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ON DUTY THE NIGHT THE

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:47.116 region:rollup2
FIRE STARTED RECOGNIZE THE NEED

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:53.689 region:rollup2
FOR RESOURCES AND WE STOOD UP

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:54.023 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ORDER FOR HOURS.

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:56.091 region:rollup2
AND.

01:19:54.023 --> 01:19:57.926 region:rollup2
THAT WAS AS FRUSTRATING AS YOU

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:59.728 region:rollup2
CAN IMAGINE WE COULD HEAR THE

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:02.398 region:rollup2
INCIDENT COMMANDERS IN THE NORTH

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:04.833 region:rollup2
BAY FIRES ASKING FOR RESOURCES

01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:06.535 region:rollup2
AND WE WERE UNABLE THIS TO SEND

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:07.670 region:rollup2
THEM. UP OPERATING WITHIN THE

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:09.638 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND AND THAT.

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:10.939 region:rollup2
WAS BASED ON TWO SIGNIFICANT

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:12.508 region:rollup2
ISSUES FIRST HALL ONE OF THE

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:15.311 region:rollup2
CHOKE POINTS WAS THE FACT THAT

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:15.311 region:rollup2
THE DISPATCH CENTERS WERE

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:18.514 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ADDITIONAL

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:22.017 region:rollup2
DISPATCHERS ON DUTY TO.

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:23.319 region:rollup2
A SIMBOLOS RESOURCES AS YOU

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:24.119 region:rollup2
HEARD A DIRECTOR GALLUCCI SAID

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.721 region:rollup2
IT'S THOSE DISPATCHERS

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:27.656 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSEMBLE THOSE

01:20:25.721 --> 01:20:27.923 region:rollup2
STRIKE TEAMS IN THOSE RESOURCES

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:31.093 region:rollup2
AND THE.

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:32.695 region:rollup2
EARLY STAGES THE OF THESE FIRES

01:20:31.093 --> 01:20:34.296 region:rollup2
AND THOSE PERSONNEL JUST ONE

01:20:32.695 --> 01:20:36.932 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE THE SECOND CHOKE POINT

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:38.267 region:rollup2
IN THE SYSTEM IS AS AS CHIEF

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:40.636 region:rollup2
WARREN'S AND SAID. WERE

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:41.036 region:rollup2
OPERATING UNDER A FIFTY YEAR OLD

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:41.770 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:43.572 region:rollup2
THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN THE LAST

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:44.840 region:rollup2
FIFTY YEARS AND AND BEFORE WE

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:46.575 region:rollup2
DEPENDED ON THAT MUTUAL AID

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.376 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO GET US RESOURCES IN

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:49.078 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TWELVE THE TWENTY FOUR

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:51.013 region:rollup2
HOURS. NOW WE NEED THOSE

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:52.514 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IN THE FIRST MINUTES

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:54.516 region:rollup2
TO HOURS OF THIS INCIDENT AND

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:56.485 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM JUST QUICKLY BECOMES

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:57.786 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMED SO NOT ONLY WERE

01:20:56.485 --> 01:20:59.288 region:rollup2
THERE NOT ENOUGH DISPATCHERS.

01:20:57.786 --> 01:21:01.056 region:rollup2
BUT THE SYSTEM CHOKE DOWN VERY

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:02.891 region:rollup2
QUICKLY WHERE WE WERE UNABLE TO

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:04.493 region:rollup2
GET AN ORDER.

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:06.161 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN SEND OUR

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:08.130 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT WE HAD ASSEMBLED.

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:10.099 region:rollup2
AND AND OUR GOAL WAS TO FOLLOW

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:11.433 region:rollup2
THAT SYSTEM AS WE HAVE FOR THE

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:13.602 region:rollup2
LAST FOR ME YOU FOR THE LAST

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:16.672 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AND AND NOT

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:18.240 region:rollup2
SEND RESOURCES WITHOUT IN ORDER.

01:21:16.672 --> 01:21:19.842 region:rollup2
NAM WHERE IN A POSITION RIGHT

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.110 region:rollup2
NOW WHERE IT'S I I CALLED THE

01:21:19.842 --> 01:21:22.411 region:rollup2
TRADE FECHTER I THINK LOCAL

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:24.513 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE LOWEST

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:26.115 region:rollup2
NUMBER RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE

01:21:24.513 --> 01:21:28.150 region:rollup2
DUE TO THE RECESSION AND OTHER.

01:21:26.115 --> 01:21:30.386 region:rollup2
REVENUE ISSUES AT THE SAME TIME

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:34.256 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FIRES THAT ARE BURNING

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:34.790 region:rollup2
FASTER THAN ANY FIRES WE'VE THAT

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:35.357 region:rollup2
WE'VE EVER SEEN THE HORROR

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:38.327 region:rollup2
NOVEL.

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:39.762 region:rollup2
CAPITALIZE ON WHAT'S SENATE

01:21:38.327 --> 01:21:40.229 region:rollup2
MCGUIRE SAID EARLIER HOW LONG WE

01:21:39.762 --> 01:21:40.863 region:rollup2
GONNA CALL THESE FIRES

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:42.197 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED WHEN WE CONTINUE

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:43.399 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THEM YEAR AFTER YEAR

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:45.567 region:rollup2
AFTER YEAR SOON THEY'LL THEY

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:46.435 region:rollup2
SHOULD BECOME THE NORM. SO HAVE

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.736 region:rollup2
THE FEWEST NUMBER RESOURCES

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:49.371 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE FASTEST BURNING

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.572 region:rollup2
FIRES THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN AND

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:52.841 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A FIFTY YEAR OLD SYSTEM

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:54.777 region:rollup2
TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THOSE BIG

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:57.679 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES.

01:21:54.777 --> 01:21:58.981 region:rollup2
WHEN THE THOMAS FIRE OCCURRED.

01:21:57.679 --> 01:22:00.549 region:rollup2
SEVERAL HOURS INTO THE INCIDENT

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.016 region:rollup2
I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY

01:22:00.549 --> 01:22:04.019 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES IN SOUTHERN

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:05.988 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. WHO WHO SAID THAT

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:07.990 region:rollup2
THEY WERE? NEEDING RESOURCES

01:22:05.988 --> 01:22:09.458 region:rollup2
BADLY AGAIN I HAD RESOURCES

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:11.026 region:rollup2
STOOD UP READY TO GO I COULD NOT

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:13.962 region:rollup2
GET IN ORDER IN THE SYSTEM.

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:15.164 region:rollup2
.

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:16.031 region:rollup2
AYE CHIEF TO RE UNITE FIRE

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:17.332 region:rollup2
CHIEF ALONG BEACH MADE THE

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:18.801 region:rollup2
DECISION THAT WE WERE GOING TO

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:20.335 region:rollup2
PUT OUR RESOURCES ON THE ROAD.

01:22:18.801 --> 01:22:22.037 region:rollup2
AND SENATE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:23.338 region:rollup2
WITHOUT IN ORDER BECAUSE OF THE

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:25.607 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION WE EXPERIENCE IN THE

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:26.508 region:rollup2
NORTH BAY FIRES AND AND LATER I

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:28.243 region:rollup2
FOUND OUT HIS TWO FRIENDS IN

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:29.578 region:rollup2
JUST TESTIFIED. THAT'S THE NORM

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:31.113 region:rollup2
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY'VE

01:22:29.578 --> 01:22:32.848 region:rollup2
LEARNED WAYS TO GET OUTSIDE OF

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:34.249 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM TO GET RESOURCES

01:22:32.848 --> 01:22:36.618 region:rollup2
MOVING.

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:38.086 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO AGAIN TAKE TO GET

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:40.456 region:rollup2
THOSE RESOURCES AS FAST AS THEY

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:43.058 region:rollup2
NEED SO. I I'M I'M HERE TODAY TO

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:44.426 region:rollup2
SAY WE NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:45.727 region:rollup2
HANNAH AND WHILE I WILL AGREE

01:22:44.426 --> 01:22:47.496 region:rollup2
IT'S A MODEL SYSTEM BUT IT NEEDS

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:50.799 region:rollup2
CHANGE. FIRST AND FOREMOST THE

01:22:47.496 --> 01:22:51.867 region:rollup2
PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES IS

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.568 region:rollup2
VITAL.

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:54.069 region:rollup2
THOSE THOUGH IT WENT WHEN WE SAY

01:22:52.568 --> 01:22:56.205 region:rollup2
THE PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:57.973 region:rollup2
WHAT WE MEAN IS. WE RECOGNIZE

01:22:56.205 --> 01:22:58.941 region:rollup2
OUR PREDICTIVE SERVICES ARE GOOD

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.742 region:rollup2
SURE THEY CAN GET BETTER BUT WE

01:22:58.941 --> 01:23:02.110 region:rollup2
KNOW IN ADVANCE WELL IN ADVANCE

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:05.180 region:rollup2
OF THE WIND EVENT OCCURRING FOR

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:06.748 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE. AND AND WE CAN IDENTIFY

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:09.151 region:rollup2
THOSE RESOURCES THAT WE WANT TO

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:10.118 region:rollup2
STAFF UP AND PUT IN THOSE AREAS

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:12.187 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'RE GOING I NEED HIM THE

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:13.722 region:rollup2
MOST. THOSE SYSTEMS KEEP THAT

01:23:12.187 --> 01:23:15.891 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY THOSE RESOURCES CAN BE

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:18.494 region:rollup2
USED FOR SMALLER FIRES TO KEEP

01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:19.328 region:rollup2
THEM SMALL AS AS THAT CHIEF

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.829 region:rollup2
TEMAS SAID THAT'S THAT'S THAT

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:22.931 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY IMPORTANT PIECES TO

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:23.732 region:rollup2
KEEP THOSE FIRE SMALL WE CAN DO

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:25.701 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THOSE.

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:27.803 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SET UP IN

01:23:25.701 --> 01:23:30.205 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM AND WHEN THE BIG

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:31.740 region:rollup2
EVENT OCCURS THERE ALREADY

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:33.508 region:rollup2
WITHIN OUR RESOURCE ORDERING

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:34.676 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SO THERE'S NO PROCESSING

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:35.744 region:rollup2
TIME WE CAN JUST QUICKLY

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:38.013 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THE FIRE THE NEEDS

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:40.015 region:rollup2
THOSE RESOURCES.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.049 region:rollup2
VERY CRITICAL COMPONENT OF WHAT

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:43.118 region:rollup2
WE'RE HERE TO ASK YOU FOR TODAY

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:44.953 region:rollup2
IS FUNDING FOR THE PRE

01:23:43.118 --> 01:23:46.488 region:rollup2
POSITIONING OF RESOURCES AHEAD

01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:48.724 region:rollup2
OF THESE CLIMATE DRIVEN EVENTS.

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:50.726 region:rollup2
SECONDLY WE NEED TO NOT ONLY

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:52.728 region:rollup2
MOVE FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRE

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:53.896 region:rollup2
ENGINES BUT WE NEED TO PUT.

01:23:52.728 --> 01:23:55.764 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL DISPATCHERS IN THESE

01:23:53.896 --> 01:23:57.499 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS KNOWING

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:58.767 region:rollup2
THAT WHETHER NOT THERE'S A BIG

01:23:57.499 --> 01:24:00.636 region:rollup2
FIRE NOT DAY ARE GOING TO BE

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:03.705 region:rollup2
PROCESSING A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:05.507 region:rollup2
CALLS. AND IF THE BIG ONE OCCURS

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.275 region:rollup2
IN IN THAT CLUSTER OF CALLS SO

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:07.943 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:24:06.275 --> 01:24:09.411 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE. THEN WE HAVE THAT

01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:11.413 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO HANDLE

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:12.748 region:rollup2
THAT AND STREAMLINE THE SYSTEM

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:14.283 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY I WILL SAY THAT THE

01:24:12.748 --> 01:24:15.584 region:rollup2
RAS ORDERING SYSTEM.

01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:17.519 region:rollup2
IT'S NO SECRET THAT'S A

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:18.887 region:rollup2
CUMBERSOME DIFFICULT SYSTEM TO

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:21.423 region:rollup2
NAVIGATE.

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:23.158 region:rollup2
I AYE AS IT HAS CHIEF PIMLOTT

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:24.359 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED EARLIER. IT DOES

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:25.861 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE WITH OUR FEDERAL

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:26.161 region:rollup2
PARTNERS IN OUR STATE PARTNERS

01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:28.330 region:rollup2
WE NEED SOME

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:30.198 region:rollup2
IT WORKS.

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:31.500 region:rollup2
WELL AT THE STATE AND LOCAL

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:32.701 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND THEN WE CAN WORRY

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.369 region:rollup2
ABOUT OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS NOW

01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:36.271 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY OPINION SPEAKING FROM

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:37.773 region:rollup2
A LOCAL FIRE SHE'S PERSPECTIVE.

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:40.142 region:rollup2
WE NEED A SYSTEM TO GET

01:24:37.773 --> 01:24:41.677 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ON THE ROAD SOONER

01:24:40.142 --> 01:24:42.611 region:rollup2
THAN LATER SO. I'M JUST I'M

01:24:41.677 --> 01:24:44.846 region:rollup2
SIMPLY GOING TO RECAP MY

01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:46.648 region:rollup2
COMMENTS BY SAYING FIFTY YEAR

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:48.483 region:rollup2
OLD SYSTEM YES IT'S A MODEL BUT

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:49.251 region:rollup2
FIFTY YEAR OLD ANYTHING NEEDS

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:52.554 region:rollup2
UPDATING.

01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:54.356 region:rollup2
PROBABLY INCLUDING MYSELF. WE

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:55.157 region:rollup2
NEED WE NEED MORE DISPATCHERS WE

WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A LOT.

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:07.628 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE

01:41:06.127 --> 01:41:09.730 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR IS A NEARLY ENOUGH TO

01:41:07.628 --> 01:41:12.700 region:rollup2
COVER THE EXPENSE THAT LOCAL

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:14.068 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WILL INCUR.

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:15.836 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY ASKED WELL WHAT IS

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:22.543 region:rollup2
MOST OF MY UP STAFFING OR PRE

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:24.912 region:rollup2

BUDGET CYCLE. AND THEY'LL PUT A

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:33.287 region:rollup2
FEW DAYS ASIDE FOR PRE

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:35.923 region:rollup2
WE CALL IT ON THE LOCAL

01:41:34.155 --> 01:41:37.258 region:rollup2

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:40.027 region:rollup2
