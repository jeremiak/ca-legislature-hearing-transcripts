THE ROLL. CENTER SKINNER I'M HERE ENTER MORLOCK. SENATOR ABOUT. ALL RIGHT SO -- ONE SECOND OUR FIRST TWO WISHES ARE VOTE ONLY BUT I'M IN A SKIP -- RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE ARE A MISSING ONE OF OUR MEMBERS AND I'M GONNA GO TO ISSUE. THREE I'M [inaudible] THE A ONE SECOND. I'M GONNA GO TO ISSUE THREE WHICH IS THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING POST. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF POST MANNY ALVAREZ HERE -- AND WHO ARE YOU JOINT [inaudible] BY. I'M THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MARIA SANDOVAL WELCOME. WHOEVER'S GONNA OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. US SENATOR AND LEASING GENTLEMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT THIS BUDGET HEARING. MY NAME IS MANNY ALVAREZ I SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING OR POST AS WE ARE COMMONLY KNOWN. SEE TO MY LEFT IS A MISS MARIA SAND OF ALL THE POST ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR FIELD SERVICES. THIS IS MADE UP OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE STATE. BY SETTING HIRING STANDARDS THE LIVING TRAINING CONDUCTING AUDITS AND SETTING REGULATIONS FOR FORTY ONE POLICE ACADEMIES AND JUST OVER SIX HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WHICH VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE OPPOSE PROGRAM. EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND FULL TIME PEACE OFFICERS EIGHT THOUSAND RESERVE. PEACE OFFICERS AND EIGHT THOUSAND PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHERS ARE SERVED BY POST. GOVERNOR NUISANCE PROPOSED BUDGET FOR POST INCLUDES A THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR. GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION. CONSISTING OF FOURTEEN POINT NINE MILLION. FOR RESTORATION AND CREATION OF NEW. TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND TWENTY MILLION FOR USE OF DE ESCALATION. USE OF FORCE AND MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING. THE POST BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FUNDING AND THREE CUSTOMARY MANNERS [inaudible] ADMINISTRATION. TRAINING DELIVERY AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE. OR AGENCY REIMBURSEMENT. UNFORTUNATELY DISPLAYING THE FUNDING IN THE B. C. P. UTILIZING THESE CATEGORIES DOES NOT CLEARLY DELINEATE. HOW CLOSE WILL UTILIZE THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR THE USE OF FORCE? THE ESCALATION AND MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING. YES I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO ADDRESS THIS. MOST OF THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AS LOCAL ASSISTANCE OR AGENCY REIMBURSEMENT TO CITY. AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS WHICH PARTAKE IN USE OF FORCE DE ESCALATION AND MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING. WE'VE DISTRIBUTED TO YOU A COPY OF A REPORT CONTAINING POST TRAINING USE OF FORCE DE ESCALATION AND MENTAL HEALTH. EACH ONE OF THOSE COURSES CONTAINS. CONCEPTS IN TOPICS THAT ADDRESS EACH ONE OF THOSE THREE AREAS. IS IS DEMONSTRATED IN THIS REPORT. WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT POST CERTIFIED TRAINING COURSES WHICH COVER THESE THREE AREAS. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS POST IS AVERAGED 460-001-0090 EIGHT COURSE COMPLETIONS EACH YEAR. A COURSE COMPLETIONS MEANS ONE PERSON COMPLETED EACH COURSE. AND THAT'S ONE PERSON COULD HAVE COMPLETED MULTIPLE COURSES. THE MAJORITY OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT COURSES HAVE EITHER BEEN DE FUNDED BY POST OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS DUE TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. OR POST IS SIMPLY NEVER REIMBURSED FOR THIS TYPE OF TRAINING. POST IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING ALL TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT COURSES TO BE FULLY FUNDED FOR LOCAL. EIGHT LOCAL ASSISTANCE OR AGENCY REIMBURSEMENT. FROM A BUDGET STANDPOINT. POST ESTIMATES THAT ONE EIGHT OUR FULLY FUNDED TRAINING COURSE. WILL COST POST A MINIMUM OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT IF TRAVEL IS NOT IN THE TRAINING. IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE TRAINING. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A STUDENT IF TRAVEL MUST BE TAKEN TO PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING. THUS USING THE AVERAGE NUMBER COMPLETIONS. YEAR AT A RATE OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY THE QUEETS TO FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN LOCAL ASSISTANCE OR AGENCY REIMBURSEMENT. OR ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION. WHEN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR NUMBERS USED? OF COURSE NOT ALL TRAINING WILL REQUIRE TRAVEL. BUT THESE NUMBERS ONLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ONE EIGHT HOUR COURSE. MANY OF THE EXISTING TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MANY OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT EXISTING COURSES ARE MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS. IN LENGTH AND SOME ARE AS LONG AS FORTY HOURS. THE US POST COULD VERY CONSERVATIVE CONSERVATIVELY DISTRIBUTE FOUR POINT SIX TO ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE AGENCY REIMBURSEMENT. IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ADDITIONALLY THESE NUMBERS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY FORM OF BACK FILL FUNDING WHICH THE BCP ALSO REQUESTS AND POST ANTICIPATES. USING FOR THIS TYPE OF TRAINING. LOS IS ARTICULATED A VISION OF GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND THE LEGISLATURE TO FURTHER THESE THREE TRAINING INITIATIVES. AND IN EARLY JANUARY. TWENTY NINETEEN HOST DISTRIBUTED PORTENTS TO ALL POST AGENCIES REQUESTING THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT. DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DE ESCALATION AND MENTAL HEALTH COURSES. WHICH WILL BE COUPLED WITH FULL FUNDING BY POST. THUS WE ANTICIPATE POST WILL HAVE ILL SOON HAVE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT COURSES. IF APPROVED. POSTAL WE'VE THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF DE ESCALATION USE OF FORCE AND MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING IN THE FOLLOWING POST COURSES. THE ACADEMY INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. COLLEGE EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT COURSE. FIELD TRAINING OFFICER TRAINING. MANAGEMENT COURSE. SUPERVISORY LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE AND THE SUPERVISORY COURSE. I DID NOT MENTION THE BASIC POLICE ACADEMY BECAUSE IN JANUARY. TWENTY NINETEEN COAST ALREADY INITIATED A PILOT TRAINING PROGRAM AT THREE OF THE FORTY ONE POLICE ACADEMIES. THE PILOT TRAINING INCLUDES DE ESCALATION. TRAINING AS WELL AS PROCEDURAL JUSTICE AND TACTICAL MEDICAL CARE. USE OF FORCE AND MENTAL HEALTH -- TRAINING IS ALREADY INCORPORATED INTO THE PERMANENT BASIC ACADEMY CURRICULUM. INTOTAL. EIGHT PROGRAMS I JUST FIFTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS PER YEAR. AND APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND OF THOSE FIFTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ARE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND WILL HELP SHAPE THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN BOTH PUBLIC. AND PRIVATE SECTORS IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT THOSE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND TREMENDOUSLY INFLUENCE THE DIRECTION. AND CULTURE OF AN ORGANIZATION. EACH SERGEANT LIEUTENANT AN EXECUTIVE SERVES AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER TO INFLUENCE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. IN THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND. BY WEAVING THESE CRITICAL. TOPICS ROUTE THE VAST SPECTRUM OF POST. WITH THE RETURN ON AND THEY'VE WE ARE CONFIDENT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WILL BE EXPONENTIALLY GREATER AND IF THE TRAINING WERE LIMITED TO STAND ALONE COURSES. POST ESTIMATES THIS WILL RESULT IN EXPENDITURES IN ADMINISTRATION TRAINING AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE BUT WILL PRIMARILY LEVERAGE A SERIES OF TRAINING CONTRACTS TO EXPAND OF TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AS I NOTED EARLIER POST IS PILOTING DE ESCALATION TRAINING IN THE BASIC ACADEMY. AND APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED CADETS WILL RECEIVE THIS TRAINING BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN AS OF TODAY. THE FEEDBACK RECEIVED BY THE THREE PILOT ACADEMIES AND MOST OF THE STUDENTS HAS BEEN POSITIVE. SHOULD POST WHICH TO REIMBURSE FOR THE BASIC ACADEMY DE ESCALATION TRAINING. OR SHOULD THE DE ESCALATION TRAINING BECOME MANDATORY UNDER COMMISSION REGULATION. OR LAW IT WILL RESULT IN AN ADDITIONAL LOCAL ASSISTANCE AGENCY REIMBURSEMENT OF BETWEEN DOLLARS. POST IS CURRENTLY UNABLE TO REIMBURSE FOR THIS TRAINING BECAUSE THE REIMBURSEMENT CAP. IS SET AT SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR HOURS OF TRAINING THE RATE OF FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY. OF THE FORTY ONE K. ACADEMIES. THE SHORTEST ACADEMY IS CURRENTLY SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY HOURS WELL OVER THE SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOR OUR REIMBURSEMENT CAP. THE B. C. P. REQUEST FUNDING FOR BASIC CATAMARANS DIRECTION SO THE CAP CAN BE RAISED EIGHT HUNDRED HOURS OF TRAINING AT A RATE OF SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS. I'M ALMOST DONE MADAM CHAIR I PROMISE. THE QUESTION SO OKAY -- WE GET TO THOSE THE BURN OFF I'VE GOT THIRTY SECONDS LEFT. IN THE B. C. P. POST REQUESTED ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR INSTRUCTOR DEVELOPMENT. OF THAT AMOUNT SIX IS EXPECTING. TO USE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO PROVIDE YEARLY DE ESCALATION IMPLICIT BIAS AND USE OF FORCE TRAINING TO ALL BASIC ACADEMY INSTRUCTORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CLOSE IS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO DELIVER THIS TRAINING IN PERSON. TO ONE ACADEMY AT A TIME. THE PROPOSAL IS FOR FIVE TEAMS OF INSTRUCTORS TO DELIVER YOUR EARLY TRAINING TO EACH OF THE FORTY ONE ACADEMIES. THIS IS ALSO IN DISCUSSIONS WITH A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY GENCY TO DEVELOP. UNDER CONTRACT ES DE ESCALATION AND USE OF FORCE SYMPOSIUM WITH WELL KNOWN INDUSTRY EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA ON FOR SOME EXECUTIVES. AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMPOSIUM WILL BE TO DEVELOP THE ESCALATION CONSIDERATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. POSTAL ADDRESS SUCH THINGS AS POLICY TACTICS TECHNIQUES AND COMMUNITY POLICING. WE ANTICIPATE A SERIES OF BEST PRACTICES WILL BE DEVELOPED. AND PUBLISHED BY POST. POST WE USE THESE BEST PRACTICES AS A FOUNDATION FOR ITS LEGACY -- COURSE IT LEGACY INSTRUCTION COURSES. CLOSE WILL HOLD TO TRAINING SYMPOSIUMS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVES TO COVER THESE TOPICS WHEN NORTH AND ONE SOUTH. MOST ESTIMATES THE TO DO ALL THIS WILL REQUIRE A COMBINATION OF TRAINING AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE AGENCY REIMBURSEMENT TOTALING UP TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. CLOSE WILL UTILIZE THESE GUIDELINES TO CREATE NEW TRAINING COURSES FOR PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHER. TO CREATE ONE NEW TRAINING COURSE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHERS AND ONE NEW COURSE FOR PEACE OFFICERS. LASTLY THE BCP REQUESTED ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN TRAINING MONIES FOR THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAMS DE FUNDED BY POSTING. TWENTY SEVENTEEN POST WILL UTILIZE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THAT MONEY TO AUDIT INSTRUCTION RELATED TO DE ESCALATION. USE OF FORCE AND MENTAL HEALTH. AGAIN WE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. YOU BEFORE I'M WE HEAR FROM LA -- AND OTHERS. THE FIRST THING I WANT. TO DISCUSS. IS THE FACT THAT THE BCP PROVIDED BY POST. GIVES A VERY DIFFERENT NARRATIVE. THEN THE SUMMARY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET [inaudible] I'M. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUMMARY DESCRIBES THE TWENTY MILLION COMPONENT THAT IS ONGOING AND AN EXTENSION OF THE FUNDING WE PROVIDED LAST YEAR TWENTY FIVE MILLION. WHICH WOULD BE FOR THE TRAINING AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO FORCE DE ESCALATION OFFICER WELLNESS IMPLICIT BIAS IN VARIOUS THINGS LIKE THAT. NOW THE PCP THAT POST SUBMITTED DOES NOT COVER HOW ANY OF THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION WOULD GO TO THOSE EFFORTS AND WHILE YOU MENTION SOME IN YOUR VERBAL TESTIMONY. WRITTEN DOCUMENT WE HAVE IS A VCP [inaudible] I'M. THE OTHER THING NOW YOU DON'T ADDRESS THIS YET I WANT TO FIRST GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHY THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT [inaudible] BUT ADDITIONALLY. WE PROVIDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME ONLY FUNDING DEAL ESCALATION [inaudible] AND TO DATE. IT'S BEEN NINE MONTHS. THIRTY SIX THOUSAND HAS BEEN SPENT. AND YET WE HAVE BC P. BEFORE US TO AUGMENT THE ENTIRE BUDGET OF POST BY THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION [inaudible] N. I LATER THERE'S ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT INDICATES THAT. YOU ESTIMATE THAT YOU'LL SPEND TEN MILLION OF THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION WE GAVE. BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BLACK STILL INTO THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR. AND I SUPPOSE OUR FIRST THING I. YOU'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO SPEND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND AND NINE MONTHS SO THAT'S AND MILLION THAT'S QUITE A LEAP. BUT THEN IF YOU'RE ANTICIPATING TO SPEND THE MONEY WE ALREADY GAVE YOU. THROUGH TO THE END OF NINETEEN TWENTY WHY SHOULD WE GIVE YOU ANOTHER. THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION CERTAINLY BUT THERE MAY BE SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR A PORTION OF THAT. BUT IT'S HARD. TO JUSTIFY THE OTHER BUT I JUMPED IN I DON'T WANT THE ANSWER THAT FIRST I WANT TO FIRST GET THE BOTTOM OF WHY. GOVERNOR SUMMARY IS ONE THING B. C. P. IS ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ERIN EDWARDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I UNDERSTAND THERE MAY BE SOME CONFUSION BETWEEN WHAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE AND THE B. C. P. AND I CERTAINLY. DON'T THINK THE INTENT WAS TO HOW TO HIDE THE BALL ABOUT HOWARD INTENDING TO SPEND THE MORNING AND MISTER NECESSARILY CALLING IT A HIDE THE BALL I'M JUST CALL LET'S RECONCILE SURE BUDGET OF MY HEARING. SURE AND I I THINK THE THE INTENT OF THE STATEMENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BDGET WAS TO INDICATE THAT THE GOVERNOR FULLY SUPPORTS -- EXPANDING DE ESCALATION MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING -- I THINK THE LEGEND HE APPRECIATES THE LEGISLATURE'S LEADERSHIP ON PROVIDING THAT FUNDING IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR AND I THINK SHARES THE COMMITMENT TO FURTHERING THOSE GOALS AND I THINK -- THERE WAS NEVER AN AND TIMES THAT W WOULD SIMPLY RE FIND THE SAME THINGS THAT WERE FUNDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS -- IN THE CURRENT YEAR MANY OF THOSE THINGS LIKE EQUIPMENT PURCHASES AND DEVELOPMENT OF CURRICULUM AREN'T REALLY THINGS THAT YOU WOULD NECESSARILY DO OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND SO I THINK THE IDEA FROM THE BEGINNING WAS THAT THE AUGMENTATION ON AN ONGOING BASIS WOULD BE USED -- TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MISTER ALVAREZ SPOKE TO ABOUT REALLY INTEGRATING. THE MENTAL HEALTH AND CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING AND DE ESCALATION TRAINING INTO THE THE FULL SPECTRUM OF TRAINING THAT THE THAT POST DELIVERS FROM THE POINT OF THE BASIC ACADEMY. THROUGH -- REGULAR ON GOING TRAININGS AND THAT ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH SENIOR LEADERSHIP TRAINING -- I REALLY JUST HAVE TO BE A HOLISTIC APPROACH IN WEAVING AND THREW OUT AND I THINK MAYBE SOME OF THE CONFUSION IS -- THAT THOSE EFFORTS REALLY REQUIRE A BROADER APPROACH AND HOW WE REIMBURSE LOCALS -- LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR ATTENDING TRIP -- TRAININGS AND TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO SIGN FOLKS -- AND SO. I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE CONFUSION ABOUT TRYING TO PINPOINT EXACTLY HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE SPENT FOR SPECIFIC. PROGRAMS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DEVELOPING STANDALONE CURRICULUM IS REALLY ABOUT WEAVING THESE COMPONENTS INTO EXISTING TRAININGS -- IN SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT CONFUSION AYE AYE TH I THINK THAT KIND OF SPEAKS TO WHAT OUR INTENT IS THOUGH. OR POST RESPONSE. I WOULD IMAGINE NOW OBVIOUSLY THE M.. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PRESENTED TO US. EARLY IN THE YEAR. AND BY THEIR YOU KNOW WAS ONLY AT IS A BRIEFER PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THE TIME WE ALLOCATED THIS ONE TIME ONLY AND WHEN THE BUDGET WAS SUBMITTED -- BUT GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST EXPLAINED. AGAIN THERE'S NOT. WE BEFORE WE CAN DO UP THE APPROPRIATE. OUR TRAINING WE HAVE TO HAVE THE CURRICULUM WE HAVE TO HAVE THE EQUIPMENT WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE THINGS YOU REFERENCED. WHICH YOU'RE RIGHT. OF THE ALLOCATION OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME ONLY WAS TO GET US IN THAT POSITION TO DO SO. AND SINCE WE'RE NOT YET. IN THAT SITUATION TO DO SO. WHY WOULD WE NOW CERTAINLY I CAN APPRECIATE WHY POTENTIALLY IN THE FUTURE? WE WOULD GREATLY BE EXPANDING POST BUDGET BASED ON NOW. THIS EXPANDED TRAINING THE CURRICULUM WE HAVE ALL OF THAT. BUT WHEN WE HAVEN'T WE'RE NOT EVEN THERE YET. THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY I'M HAVING. YEAH I I CAN APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT THE FROM OUR STANDPOINT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT POST IS BEING CAREFUL ON HOW THEY PROCEED WITH SPENDING THOSE DOLLARS IN THAT. THEY'RE DOING ENOUGH THOUGHTFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE AND HOLISTIC WAY -- I THINK THAT MISTER ALVAREZ COULD BETTER SPEAK TO KIND OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SPENT AND AND WHERE THEY'RE AT AND THAT PROCESS BUT I THINK -- WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO PROCEED THOUGHTFULLY AND NOT TO RUSH FORWARD AND AND SPEND THE WAY AND ON AND ON SPEND THE MONEY IN A WAY THAT'S NOT GONNA BE AS ACTIVE. IS THERE BEFORE MISTER POST ME MISTER ALVAREZ FOR POST ANSWERS. IF THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION RELATED TO THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING THAT YOU WANT TO RAISE A EITHER -- EITHER MEMBER. BUT IN THE END HE COULD ADDRESS THAT ONCE YOU PLEASE FEEL FREE SENATOR MOORLACH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MYSTRAS -- I AM BRAND NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE SO MAY I ASK YOU SOME VERY BASIC QUESTIONS. WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS MODEL? LIKE LIKE A LIKE IF I'M A CPA BACKGROUND SO I HAVE TO GET FORTY HOURS A YEAR OF CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. I GO THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA'S CPA FOUNDATION. NO THERE THERE LIKE AB OUT. THERE NONPROFIT BUT THEY MAKE A PROFIT BY MY PAYING. FOR I COURSES SO REVENUES. AND THEN YOU HAVE EXPENSES PAYING FOR YOUR INSTRUCTORS AND RUNNING THE ROOMS AND WHATEVER WHAT. SALAS SAYS I I HAVE. NO UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR MODELS I APOLOGIZE THAT. SO. WHY DO YOU EVEN NEED FUNDING FROM THE STATE IF YOU'RE? CHARGING FOR COURSES OR ARE YOU NOT CHARGING FOR COURSE WE DO NOT CHARGE FOR FORCES OKAY THANK YOU. SO WHY NOT WHY NOT I'M JUST HELP ME OUT. I BELIEVE THE PENAL CODE SAYS IT WOULD RECEIVE CLOSE TO PROVIDE STATE AID TO POST PARTICIPATING AGENCIES PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO THROUGH LOCALLY. REIMBURSEMENT. WE DELIVER TRAINING IN TWO PRIMARY METHODS ONE WE EITHER DELIVER IT OURSELVES OR UNDER CONTRACT WE DEVELOP THE CURRICULUM AND ITS DEPLOYED. OR AGENCIES AND PRIVATE COMPANIES AND PRIVATE PRESENTERS SPRING TRAINING TO US FOR US TO REVIEW AND CERTIFY. AND WE MAY OR MAY NOT FUND THAT TYPE OF TRAINING. SO AGENCIES ARE FOR THE MOST PART HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE LEAST OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- TO PAY FOR THE SALARIES OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND SUCH WHILE WE'VE BEEN. AT TRAINING SOME OF THE TRAINING IS NOT FUNDED SO THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN TRAVEL AND SUCH SO. WE PAY TO EITHER DELIVERY OR WE FIND SOME OF THE TRAINING WE HAVE BEEN FUNDING MANDATED TRAINING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. ANYTHING THAT WE REQUIRE THEM TO DO FOR INSTANCE TO BE FIELD TRAINING OFFICER YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A POST COURSE WE FULLY PAY FOR THAT. BUT SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF WE HAVE NOT SO OUR MODEL IS. EVERY PIECE OFFICER ACROSS THE STATE HAS TO RECEIVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS THAT IS NOT A LOT. ON THE AVERAGE PEACE OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA THIS LAST. OUR CYCLE AVERAGE FORTY FOUR POINT THREE HOURS -- AVERAGE THE SAUCER IN DISPATCHER AVERAGE FORTY FOUR POINT THREE HOURS OF TRAINING. EVERY. AS IN ALL IN THAT TWO YEAR CYCLE OR I'M SORRY EVERY YEAR DURING THAT TWO YEAR CYCLE. THAT NUMBER WE WERE ABLE TO BUMP UP OVER THIS LAST CYCLE THAT IS A POSITIVE FOR US FROM FORTY THREE HOURS TO FORTY FOUR POINT THREE WITHOUT THEM FEELING IT. WHICH IS A POSITIVE EITHER THE TRAININGS MORE EFFICIENT IT'S DELIVERED IN A IN A BETTER WAY IF THEIR THEIR TRAINING HOURS INCREASE WITHOUT INCREASE CASA WE TRACK. THAT CONSTANTLY ON WE TRY TO PUT OUR EMPHASIS ON THE BASED ECONOMY. AND ON LEADERSHIP COURSES THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUS IS BEEN. BUT THE BASIC ACADEMY LAST COUPLE YEARS IS REALLY WHAT'S TAKEN ON PRIVACY FOR US BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THE FOUNDATION. FOR PEACE OFFICERS WHEN THEY FIRST START INCLUDING FIELD TRAINING SO WE'VE TRIED TO DEVELOP THOSE CURRICULUMS AS BEST WE CAN TO KEEP AND CONTEMPORARY. TO INCLUDE SUCH THINGS AS DE ESCALATION TRAINING AT THE VERY BEGINNING. ARM AND I I WOULD LIKE TO ADD JUST -- TO THIS. IN TERMS OF LIKE THE ESCALATION TRAIN WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF FUNDING [inaudible] IN. OCTOBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE ALREADY APPROACH THE COMMISSION ASKING FOR AUTHORITY TO SIR REVIEWING WHAT WE COULD DO WITH DE ESCALATION TRAINING AT THE ACADEMY. IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AGAIN WITH NO FUNDING. WE'VE GOT APPROVAL FROM THE COMMISSION TO INCORPORATE. DE ESCALATION TRAINING IN THE PILOT IN THE IN THE ACADEMIES THIS IS BEFORE WE RECEIVED ANY OF FUNDING FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE GAP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THAT HELPS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR LETTING ME ASK THE RUDIMENTARY. I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF TEACHING TWO COURSES FOR POST. AND THEY WERE WELL ATTENDED YEAH YEAH. PHAM LEARNING THANK YOU. SENATOR BELL DID YOU WANNA SOMETHING NOW BEFORE WE GET ON THIS ISSUE -- OKAY SO I GOT THE THE WERE -- WE PUT IN THE BUDGET THE MONEY THE EXTRA MONEY. TO THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE AND THEN WE SPENT THIRTY SIX MILLION [inaudible] SO. FOR SO WHY WHY OF THE KIND OF MAKES ME LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT BECAUSE I GIVE YOU MONEY AND THEN YOU DON'T SPEND A A GO TO SPEND IT ON SOMETHING ELSE. YOU KNOW -- WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN THIS YEAR? I MEAN YOU GOT THE MONEY YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE SURE IN AND SPEND THE MONEY WE GET YOUR LAST YEAR. KIND OF HARD FOR ME. TO THINK ABOUT GIVING MONEY. AGAIN. IF WE GIVE YOU MONEY FOR CERTAIN THINGS LASHER UNITS SPEND SO -- WAS THERE A REASON WHY IT AND SPEND THE MONEY WHO TOLD YOU NOT TO SPEND THE MONEY. AS I AM. SIGN LOOK AT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM LAST YEAR SENATOR. BROKEN DOWN INTO THREE BUCKETS ONE IS DE ESCALATION ONE IS MENTAL HEALTH AND ONE IS -- AN INNOVATIVE GRANTS PROGRAM IF I CAN TAKE THEM BACKWARDS SO THE INNOVATIVE GRANTS PROGRAM IS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT THAT IS A PROCESS THAT. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN GRANTS IT TOOK US AWHILE TO GET THAT PROGRAM SET UP AND THANK. THANK FULLY. WE HAD ANOTHER STATE AGENCY TO HELP US ROUTE PROCESS THIRTY FOUR POINT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE AWARDED ON TUESDAY. WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED FORTY FOUR APPLICATIONS FOR GRANTS FROM CBO'S FROM EDUCATORS AND FROM AGENCIES. A MAJORITY OF THAT MONEY WILL GO TO CBO'S AND I WILL BE WAY TO THE FOURTH QUARTER SO YOUR FOURTH QUARTER SPENDING -- ONE FOURTH OF THE MONEY. IS THAT THE WAY IT WORKS. WELL THE OF THREE YEARS WE HAVE THREE YEARS TO SPELL IS A THREE YEAR SO YOU GOT. THE WAY TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR. TO SPEND THE MONEY [inaudible] HELLO. TO START A A GRANTS-PROGRAM FROM SCRATCH ADMITTEDLY TOOK A SOME TIME WE HAD TO HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS WE HAD TO WAIT FOR THE R. F. P. TO GET. THROUGH THE PROCESS AND GRANTS TO COMMAND THEY CAME IN IN LATE FEBRUARY. ARM IT DIDN'T TAKE IT TOOK TIME TO START FROM GROUND ZERO FROM SOME WE'VE NEVER DONE ADMITTEDLY BUT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION OF IT WILL BE AWARDED NEXT WEEK. THE OTHER IN THE OTHER. THE OTHER COMPONENTS ARE DE-ESCALATION AND AND MENTAL HEALTH. SO IN TERMS OF THE DE ESCALATION TRAINING IT'S FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WE'VE ALREADY STARTED TO CONVERT SOME OF THE COURSES TO BEING FULLY FUNDED WHICH TAKE SOME TIME BECAUSE SOME OF THEM DO NOT HAVE BUDGETS. WE HAVE. TO WE HAVE TO ADD BUDGETS TO EACH ONE WITH EACH. WITH EACH PRESENTER AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A WIDE ARRAY OF COURSES THEY NEED BUDGETS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE DE ESCALATION TRAINING IS. ARM. A QUICK MEANT I THINK FIVE MILLION OF THAT MONEY COULD BE USED FOR EQUIPMENT FOR DE ESCALATION TRAINING PRIMARILY FOR FORCE OPTION SIMULATORS ARE VIRTUAL REALITY. TRAINING WE'VE HAD MEETINGS WITH FIVE DIFFERENT. VENDORS IN TERMS OF UPDATING OUR EXISTING EQUIPMENT -- FOR FOR SERGEANT SIMULATORS. THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS WE HAVE NOT FOUND A VENDOR AT THIS POINT OR AFP OR A PLATFORM. THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO CREATE THE SCENARIOS YOU BASICALLY GET THE SCENARIOS FROM A VENDOR AND THEY'RE VERY QUICK IF YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THEM THERE FIFTEEN SECOND SHOOT DON'T SHOOT. TYPE OF SCENARIOS WHICH WERE NOT HAPPY WITH WE WANT TO MODEL THEM IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND AND MULTIPLE BRANCHES AND YOU KNOW TO THREE MINUTE LONG. THE DIFFERENT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF DIFFERENT ONES BUT PUTTING PROPRIETARY SCENARIOS ON THOSE MACHINES IS COMPLICATED. WE HAD TWO DEMONSTRATIONS FROM VIRTUAL REALITY -- COMPANIES ON WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AND WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO GO THEY'RE NOT THERE YET WE HAD A DEMO LASTS TWO WEEKS AGO. SO WE DON'T WANT T GO IN AND JUST SPEND THE MONEY ON EQUIPMENT. THE ONE IN SAN JOSE IT'S BEEN THERE FOR THREE YEARS. CORRECT AND I AND I BELIEVE SAN JOSE'S IS A POST. PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. SO SO THAT IS THE THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE STAND WITH THE EQUIPMENT. I'M IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND DE ESCALATION WE HAD THE ONE AT THE HOSPITAL VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER THE MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT PUT ONE TOGETHER. SIX YEARS AGO [inaudible] OKAY. THOUGH THE SAME -- AND VERY CANDIDLY THAN DONE I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF THE STUFF OUT THERE ALREADY. KIND OF LIKE YOU SAY YOU DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE. WELL WE HAVE THIRTY ONE I BELIEVE THIRTY ONE MACHINE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE READY. WE WE ALSO CONTRACT OUT WITH AGENCIES SUCH AS SAN JOSE PD TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THOSE MACHINES. I ACTUALLY DID IT. YEAH I MEAN IT'S GOOD VERY COULD BE BETTER. BUT ALSO ASSEMBLYMAN LOW SHOT ENDED SO GOOD WELL DILLON BROTHERS ALONG A POLICE OFFICER. TO IF IF IF IF I IF I CAN ALSO ADDRESS THE FUNDING AND HOW WE HAVEN'T REALLY SPENT IT'S A WIN WIN FIRST ENGAGE WITH IN THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR IN THE PART OF FINANCE. WE WERE VERY VERY UP FRONT AND SAID WE CANNOT SPEND THIS MONEY OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE STARTING FROM GROUND ZERO WE NEED MORE TIME AND THAT'S WHY. THE LEGISLATURE IN ASSEMBLYMEMBERS ASKED FOR HALF THE MONEY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M GOING TO GET DOWN HERE. YES FOR THE MONEY YOU ABLE TO DO AND AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT IT WILL SPEND THE MONEY AND THEN. YES. FOR WE OT A LOT OF OTHER GROUPS OF GOT TURNED DOWN FOR MONEY FOR VARIOUS OTHER THINGS IN THE BUDGET -- YOU KNOW -- WE'RE GOING TO HEAR SOME LATER TODAY THEY GOT TURNED DOWN. SO I I KIND OF I KIND OF KNOW THAT'S THAT'S THE POINT I'M MAKING I MEAN. THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER REQUEST HERE. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE POINT I'M MAKING. OF ARE YOU A CAN YOU GONNA TELLS BUT THE MENTAL HEALTH. SURE I WAS MY LEGISLATION. SOON ARE. YOU SEE THE NUMBER OF COURSES ARE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT I DID NOT BREAK THEM UP THERE THEIR COMBINED ITS USE OF FORCE DE ESCALATION MENTAL HEALTH BUT IF I DID BREAK UP THE NUMBER OF HOURS. IF YOU SEE TWO HUNDRED AND TRAINING -- COURSE COMPLETIONS ACTUAL COURSES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. ABOUT 5152% OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY MENTAL HEALTH COURSES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVEN OF THOSE COURSE COMPLETIONS RELATE TO MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING. THE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TRêN NOW. THESE ARE ALL POST OUR PERSONNEL THAT ARE BEING TRAINED ON THIS. OKAY. YOUR OWN IDEA HOW MANY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HELP BRING. THE THIS ONLY INCLUDES COURSE COMPLETIONS WE WE CAN PARSE IT OUT INTO THE INDIVIDUAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS BUT THAT WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TRAINED AT THIS POINT YEAH I'VE. THAT WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE PARSING OUT OF THE DATA FROM THE SYSTEM IT DOESN'T COME OUT THAT WAY WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU IS FORTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE OR FORTY NINE THOUSAND COURSE COMPLETIONS ARE HAPPENING EVERY YEAR. IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH DE ESCALATION AND USE OF FORCE TRAINING IN CALIFORNIA HOURS A BILL HELP TO HOMEOWNERS. SO FOR THE BASIC ACADEMY IT'S FIFTEEN HOURS AND THEN SOME OF THE OTHER MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH COURSES CAN RANGE FROM. FOUR GENERALLY SPEAKING SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY TO GO UP. TO FORTY YOU THINK THAT'S ENOUGH TRAINING. I THINK SO. I DO I BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO TRAINING IN MINUTES INCORPORATED INTO OTHER THINGS LIKE THE FIELD TRAINING PROGRAM WHICH DOESN'T CAPTURE ALL THE STUFF BUT IS A NEW OFFICER. WELL FEEL TRAINING FOR US IS CONSIDERED TRAINING WE DON'T CONSIDER THEM TO BE OFFICERS THERE SPENDING SIX MONTHS. GOING THROUGH A CURRICULUM AND TRAINING CURRICULUM THAT WE ESTABLISH ARM. WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE SITTING IN A CAR WITH ANOTHER OFFICER? AND SOME OF THAT TOUCHES ON ON DEALING WITH -- INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. RIGHT IT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THE BEGINNING THE FIRST RIVER TRAINING IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. THE CANDIDATE IS AN ACCEPTABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. SO AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF MAKING SOME KIND OF DETERMINATION. WHETHER THEY CAN COMPLETE THE TRAINING PROPERLY OR NOT. DOES THE TRAINING INCLUDE THE CULTURAL. CONFIDENCE. YES THERE IS A CULTURAL DIVERSITY COMPONENT IN THE BASIC ACADEMY I CAN'T YOU KNOW. STILL AHEAD BUT IT IT THERE IS A SEPARATE LEARNING DOMAIN ON CULTURAL DIVERSITY INSIDE OF THE ACADEMY INTERESTING GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE THAT WAS IN THE STATURE IT WITH US -- SO -- THE THE FIND SPENT ON USE OF FORCE HOW MUCH MONEY WAS SPENT ON USE OF FORCE TRAINING. SO UP UNTIL THIS YEAR USE OF FORCE WE DID NOT. WE DIDN'T FUNDED. UNLESS IMPROVE THE USE OF FORCE OF A THE AGENCY. HOW TO USE OF FORCE COURSE? DID YOU REVIEWER LOOK AT THE COURSE WORK THAT THEY WERE CLOSING -- EVERY USE OF FORCE CORSET THAT IT'S IT WAS PROPOSED TO POST. WITH EITHER CERTIFIED OR NOT CERTIFIED BY POST IT IF IT DIDN'T MEET OUR PERISHABLE SKILLS REQUIREMENTS. THEN THE USE OF FORCE TRAINING WAS NOT FUNDED BY POST THEY JUST DID IT ON THEIR OWN. I'M INTERESTED IN THEIR STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF THE USE OF FORCE TRAINING OKAY OF THEIR THERE. IS CONTROVERSY ABOUT USE OF FORCE TRAINING AND COURSES WE KNOWN -- THE QUESTION WOULD BE ARE WE ADEQUATELY REVIEWING -- USE OF FORCE TRAINING IN TERMS OF THE PROPER USE OF FORCE TRAINING AND NOT THERE'S CERTAIN. TYPES OF USE OF FORCE CONSULTANTS. THE TRAIN -- OFFICERS DIFFERENTLY THEY'RE HIRED BY. POLICE AGENCIES. TRAINED OFFICERS DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHERS. SO WE HAVE TO DISCERN DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT THE COURSES. THE CORRECT ONE WE WANT. IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA'S LAWS AND STATUTES. OKAY AND AND I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- ISSUE FOR A A LOT OF THE PUBLIC TO HAVE THE USE OF FORCE TRAINING. OF THE CERTIFIED. IN TERMS OF THE CALIFORNIA LAWS RATHER THAN HAVE OF THOSE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER. THE COUNTRY TO COME IN HERE AND THEY DO TRAINING IN THE I'VE SEEN THE VARIOUS TRAINING PEOPLE -- THE NATIONAL POLICE THE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION TODAY CERTIFIED SOME OF THESE TRAINING. NOT THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEFS WHAT WHAT ORGANIZATIONS TO A NATIONAL LEVEL. REVIEW IS -- ON THE WAY YOU CAN HAVE THE USE OF FORCE TRAINING SWORD AT OUR CERTIFIED IN CALIFORNIA BUT NATIONALLY AS A THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS COMING INTO CALIFORNIA TO TEACH YOU SO NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CERTIFYING. WITH SOMEBODY HIRES A CONSULTANT. DID YOU USE OF FORCE TRAINING. IS WHAT HAPPENS THEY HIRED THE POLICE ACADEMIES THE HIRE SOMEBODY TO COME IN. TO PAY MONEY. TO DO A USE OF FORCE TRAINING. THE CASH GOES TO THE CONSOLE. OKAY AND THE QUESTION IS. WHO ARE THESE CONSULTANTS AND WEBER WHAT KIND OF TRAINING THEY PROVIDING? OUR POLICE OFFICERS. YES SO THE QUESTION IS WHO'S WHO'S LOOKING AT THESE CONSULTANTS. TRAINING MODULES WHO'S CHECKING THEM OVER TO MAKE SURE. THEY'RE IN CONFORMANCE WITH CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA LAWS. OF EVERY OF THE FORTY ONE POLICE ACADEMY WE HAVE TRAINING AND TESTING SPECIFICATIONS THAT THEY MUST ADHERE. TO STUDENT WORKBOOK THAT WE PROVIDE THEM. WE REVIEW EVERY SINGLE COURSE OUTLINE. TO THE THIRD LEVEL OF DETAIL ON THE INSTRUCTION WE REVIEW EVERY INSTRUCTOR RESUME TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO TEACH AND THERE ARE SOME MINIMUM STANDARDS THAT THEY MUST ADHERE TO TO TEACH CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE ACADEMY. AND I MUST GO THROUGH POLL POST TRAINING. IN ORDER TO DO THAT. AT THE SAME TIME WE GO IN AND AUDIT EVERY ACADEMY EVERY THREE YEARS AT A MINIMUM THAT'S OUR GOAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS BEING DONE PROPERLY. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HEARING TO CURRICULUM WE AUDIT SOME OTHER COURSES. PART OF THE B. C. P. ASKS FOR MONEY FOR THAT PROGRAM THAT WAS DE FUNDED. I'M INTERESTED IN -- THE TYPES OF TRAINING AND THAT YOU WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE. VERSUS NON ACCEPTABLE. THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME TRAININGS THAT -- NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOUND TO BE UNACCEPTABLE -- I WANT TO FIND OUT -- HOW WE DISCERN? WHICH ONE IS WHICH AND WHICH ONES ARE BEING PAID FOR BY. OUR TAXPAYERS. THERE ARE NO POLICE OFFICERS THERE ARE NO OUTSIDE ENTITIES ARE ALLOWED TO COME IN A TRAINER POLICE ACADEMIES THEY'RE ALL POSTS CERTIFY COURSES IN POST CERTIFIED INSTRUCTORS OTHER -- PAID TO BE CONTROL OF IT THERE ARE NO THERE ARE NO CONSULTANTS THAT COME IN TO ANY LOCAL POLICE ACADEMY IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA THAT TEACH OUTSIDE OF OUR POST CURRICULUM. REALLY GO OUT TO DO SO THEY'RE PAID BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT NOW SIR COME IN AND TRAIN NOT FOR THE POLICE ACADEMIES THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WHICH DEPARTMENTS. WHICH DEPARTMENTS ARE ON THEIR OWN IF THEY WANT POST FUNDING THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS IF THEY WANT TO BRING SOMEBODY IN TO TRAIN THEM ON USE OF FORCE THAT'S UP TO EACH INDIVIDUAL POLICE AGENCY. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FUNNY FROM POST IT HAS TO BE POST CERTIFIED TRAINING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY DON'T REGULATE -- THOSE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THEY GO OFF ON THEIR OWN AND ARE SOMEBODY THE TRAIN. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. OR SHARE STUBBORN. AT YOUR YOUR CORRECT SIR IN THE IF IF THEY COME TO POST TO GET POST CERTIFIED TRAINING. ARE THERE TRAINING CERTIFIED THEN WE'RE GOING TO REVIEW IT WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID TO MAKE SURE THE INSTRUCTORS -- THE RIGHT INSTRUCTORS THAT IT'S COMPLY WITH THE LAW. AND THAT IS BEING DONE PROPERLY THOUGH THEY DO IT HOWEVER OR OUTSIDE AND DO IT OR GO AROUND CLOSED IN OUR WAYS THERE'S NOTHING. HAPPENING BUT IT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH. THERE'S REXACH AYE TRAINING ON HOW TO CATCH THAT I MEAN WHAT. WAS THE PROCESS USED TO YOU KNOW THEY COULD. YOU SHOULD HAVE POST PEOPLE AND I DO THE RIGHT THING AND THEN YOU GO AROUND AND FIND OUT THEIR TRAINING SOMEBODY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. HELLO DEPARTMENT HAS THAT ABILITY AND WE CAN'T WE DON'T CONTROL THAT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO CONTROL THAT SO FOR DEPARTMENT WANTS TO GO TO SOME PRIVATE COMPANY AND QUE KANSAS CITY. AND HAVE THEM COME TO CALIFORNIA TO TEACH THEM. IT'S EITHER GONNA BE POST CERTIFIED OR IT'S NOT AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T GET IT POST CERTIFIED IN YOU. AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT SOMETIMES GENERALLY SPEAKING MOST OF THE TRAINING IT'S BEING DONE IN CALIFORNIA IS POST CERTIFIED. ADMITTEDLY WITH SOME OF THE SOME OF THE BUDGET REDUCTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. THERE'S A DISINCENTIVE FOR THEM TO GET OPPOSE CERTIFIED BECAUSE WITH POST CERTIFICATION COMES SOME SCRUTINY. ON THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRAINING IS PROPER THAT IT'S GOOD AND THEN THEY HAVE SOME BACKING FROM POST IF THEY GET SUED. AND THEN AND THEN THERE'S FUNDING BEHIND BUT IF THERE'S NO FUNDING AT TIMES. THEN THEY DON'T COME TO US I WANT TO KNOW WHY WOULD WHY WOULD GIVE MONEY TO A POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND MAKE THEM CERTIFY THEIR TRAINING FOR POST AND THEN HAVE THEM GO AROUND US AND HAVE A NON CERTIFIED TRAINING. ON THE SAME SUBJECT. OF OF TRAINING COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY. RIGHT OF THE TABLE THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE. SO WE DON'T GIVE MONEY. TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR BOTH OF THOSE THINGS SO IF AND IF I MAY IF I CAN YOU SEEN AS A POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND THE IDEA WE REFER TO THEM IN A GREAT DEPARTMENT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T USE THEM AS AN EXAMPLE. BUT IF THEY DECIDE TO HAVE TO USE A FORCED RATINGS AND THEY BRING ONE TO POST FOR POST CERTIFICATION. WE'RE GOING TO SCRUTINIZE THAT COURSE TO MAKE SURE IT'S COMPLY IF IT'S WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE GONNA MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER WE HAVE THE MONEY TO FUND IT. BUT SAME TIME SAN JOSE PD. COULD GO. TO THE KANSAS CITY PRIVATE PRESENTER AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TWO DIFFERENT COURSES AT RPD. WE'RE GONNA DO OUR POST CERTIFIED COURSE IT'S GONNA BE FUNDED BY POST WE'RE GONNA PAY FOR THIS ONE ON OUR OWN AND IT AND IT'S JUST BETWEEN THEM. THERE'S NO RULE THAT SAYS THAT PRIVATE PERSON HAS TO BE. CLEARED BY YOU OR ANY NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IF THEY COME FOR POST CERTIFICATION SO THAT THE OFFICERS CAN GET CREDIT FOR TAKING THAT COURSE THEY GET NO CREDIT FOR TAKING THAT COURSE. I'M NOW THEY DON'T COME TO US IN ALL. OF THE LITTLE CORRECT SIR. OKAY MAN CHART KIND OF INTERESTED IN THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE REALITY OF THE TRAINING THAT GOES ON IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SORT. THANK YOU FOR THIS QUESTIONS -- I THINK WE NEED. TO IT'S MORE ANSWERS ABOUT HOW MUCH TRAINING. IS DONE BY POLICE DEPARTMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE POST CERTIFIED. THAT'S WHERE THE I THINK MAYBE THE PROBLEM. THAT IS CLAYTON AND IF I MAY SIR THAT IS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFF IT'S HOW WE GONNA PROVE A NEGATIVE I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THOSE COURSES ARE WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING? BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ALWAYS WE CANNOT TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT THAT'S YOU CAN YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT WAT WE'RE GONNA DO WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT. AND I I I I I SIDE ON THE ON THE SIDE OF IT IT SEEMS LIKE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOING DOWN THE RIGHT PATH AND I NOT BRING IN THESE. CRAZY AND XIN COURSES THAT WE IS COMMUNITY DO NOT WANT THEM TO HAVE FOR WHAT I SEE MOST OF IT IS POSITIVE. POST CERTIFIED IF IT'S NOT CLOSER TO FIGHT STILL GOOD QUALITY TRAINING BUT THE MAJORITY OF IT I THINK IS CLOSER TO FIVE MY WORRY WOULD BE. I'M JUST FISHERMEN -- I'M SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG BUT MY WORRY IS WE HAVE THESE POSTS CERTIFY YOUR YOUR REGULATING THOSE ARE CERTIFYING ON AND THEN SOMETHING IS TRYING TO THE OFFICER THAT COUNTERS. WHAT THE POST TRAINING? AND I THINK THERE'S A DANGER. AND THAT HAPPENS POTENTIAL DANGER WHEN THAT HAPPENS. I DON'T CARE IF I CAN JUST. SAY SOMETHING -- MOST AGENCIES AND I USED TO WORK WITH SEVERAL AGENCIES AS I WAS ALONG FORCING CONSULTANT I WAS ASSIGNED TO REGION ONE WHICH IS ALL WE HAVE TO NORTHERN COASTLINE. MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HEADS. WILL NOT SEND THE PEOPLE TO TRAIN IF IT IS NOT POST CERTIFIED IT'S NOT FINANCIALLY PRUDENT FOR THEM TO DO SO BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT WE SET THE STANDARD. YOU KNOW THAT WE SET THE CURRICULUM AND TO BRING IN SOMEBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO THAT I THINK IT'S A LOT LESS THAN WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. AGAIN I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT I KNOW THAT I WAS WITH MY AGENCIES. ON A DAILY BASIS FOR FOUR YEARS AND I KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK FOR WHICH IS THE STANDARD THAT POST SETS. THE FUNDING THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY PROVIDE TO THEM TO TO TAKE THIS TRAINING. SO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE ON THE OUT LIARS. I WOULD STICK TO THEIR VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. RIGHT SO. I THINK. WELL. BOTTOM LINE THE I'VE HEARD FROM MANY OF OUR AGENCIES THAT -- THERE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THE CUTS TO POST. HAVE A REDUCE THE AMOUNT THEIR ACCESS TO TRAINING AND SO CLEARLY PART OF THE THE B. C. P. AS AS DETAILED THE POST. THE C. P.. RESTORE SOME OF THAT FUNDING. WHICH WOULD YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S ADEQUATE. FOR THE THE LEVEL OF TRAINING EITHER LEGISLATURE OR THE AGENCIES WOULD WANT IN THE END AND TO COVER ALL OFFICERS ARE NOT -- I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY BEFORE US BUT CLEARLY I SEE THAT THAT IS PART OF WHAT THE B. C. P. ASTRIDE DESCRIBED. THE THE REASON I RAISE THE QUESTIONS IS. TO ME THAT'S THAT IS A LEGITIMATE DISCUSSION. BUT IS A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION THEN THE FUNDING. FOR EXPANDED OR ENHANCE TRAINING ON THINGS LIKE USE OF FORCE AND THE MENTAL HEALTH IN THE OTHER. PRIORITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD AND SO WHAT I SAW ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND RATHER IN THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET WAS THAT [inaudible] MOVE TOWARDS. FUNDING THAT WOULD BE MORE DIRECTED TOWARDS IN FACT ENHANCING OR IF NOT ENHANCING MAKING ON GOING [inaudible] THE NEW TRAINING A NEW CURRICULUM THAT WAS DEVELOPED. AS A RESULT OF THE ONE TIME ONLY FUNDS. AND SO I I THINK. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACT ON THIS TODAY BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WILL WANT. WHEN WE COME BACK IS? SOME DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT. THE ONE TIME ONLY FUNDING TWENTY FIVE MILLION MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE SPENT. IN ONE YEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE WE WANT YOU TO GET THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT WE WANT YOU TO DEVELOP A GOOD CURRICULUM. IT WAS JUST VERY DISAPPOINTING TO SEE THAT IT WAS ONLY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT HAD BEEN SPENT AT LEAST WITH THE NUMBERS THAT I WAS PROVIDED. AND THEN TO SEE IN THE ON GOING BC HE THAT FOR EXAMPLE. UNDER THE TRAINING ENSURING QUALITY THERE'S DEVELOP FOR SCENARIOS IT'S ONLY HALF A MILLION BUT IT'S DEVELOP FOR SCENARIOS. FOR FORCE OPTION SIMULATORS AND I'M THINKING OKAY -- IS NOT. PART OF THE USE THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION WHY IS IT NEED TO BE IN THIS PCP. OR FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SUPPORT INCREASED WORKLOAD DEVELOP NEW COURSE MATERIALS CERTAINLY YOU MAY BE DEVELOPING NEW COURSE MATERIALS IN SOME OTHER AREAS. THAT'S OUR WOULDN'T POTENTIALLY BE APPROPRIATE. BUT IF FOR EXAMPLE AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THIS WERE TO BE. DEVELOPING NEW COURSE MATERIAL PRIMARILY FOR THE USE OF FORCE. OR THE OTHER MANDATES THAT WE GAVE YOU FOR THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. THEN IT WOULD SEEM THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN APPROPRIATE EXPENDITURE IN THE ONE TIME ONLY AND NOT IN THIS BCP. OR THERE'S A COUPLE OF OTHERS THAT YOU KNOW WE SO THAT'S WHAT. WE'RE GONNA WANNA -- HAVE SOME BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN WE WHEN WE ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION ON THIS. I'M. BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE LA -- BRIEFLY IF YOU CAN'T AND ABSOLUTELY -- SO I NEED ONLY WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING BEING PROPOSED HERE IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE ONGOING LEVEL FUNDING PROVIDED TO POST. SIR FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY ENSURE THAT WHATEVER FUNDING LEVEL THAT'S PROVIDED AND WHATEVER EXPENDITURE PLAN REALLY REFLECTS PRIORITY. THE PLAN THAT POST AS PUT FORWARD IS DEFINITELY ONE APPROACH -- TO PROVIDE THAT TRAINING BECAUSE THEY'VE CLEARLY EVALUATED ALL OF THE PROGRAM'S EXETER AND CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN. THAT BEING SAID THE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS HAS GONE DOWN THE PATH OF EXPRESSING SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS AND PRIORITIES AND SO THEY COULD CHOOSE TO DO SO AGAIN PARTICULARLY SINCE THIS AND THEN IT THIS IS AN INVESTMENT ONGOING DOLLARS THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT. SO THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING POST REPORT ANNUALLY ON SPECIFIC OUTCOME IN PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ARE TIED TO WHATEVER FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED. AND THIS WILL REALLY HELP THE LEGISLATURE MONITOR THE USE OF THOSE DOLLARS AND EVALUATE HOW THE FUNDING IS USED. AND ALSO TO HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE LEGISLATURE -- pFUNDING IN THE FUTURE OR CHANGE THE MIX THAT SORT OF REPORTING WOULD HELP THEM WITH THEIR DECISION MAKING. THANK YOU. I'M IN JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER POINTS -- SENATOR BILL RAISE SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND. THE QUALITY AND HE RAISED. ME MUCH OF THE QUESTIONS WERE IN MORE IN THE POTENTIAL DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF TRAINING IS THAT A DEPARTMENT MIGHT PURSUE THAT OUR POST CERTIFIED. BUT I THINK ADDITIONALLY. THERE'S BEEN. SOME INDICATION BY SOME AGENCIES THAT THERE'S A OUR ONE USE WIDE CASSETTE. YOU KNOW ANECDOTAL INFORMATION IS NOT REALLY ACCURATE TIP BUT THERE'S A A VARIANCE IN THE QUALITY EVEN OF THE POST TRAININGS [inaudible] AND SO ONE QUESTION WOULD BE HOW IS POST CURRENTLY ASSESSING THAT QUALITY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME MORE ASSURANCE THAT THERE'S HIGH LEVEL QUALITY AMONGST ALL OF THOSE. AND WHAT IS IN PLACE TO ASSESS WHETHER THOSE TRAININGS ACTIVE OR NOT [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] I'M. THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE USED TO HAVE A QUALITY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM. RATHER ROBUST ONE THAT WE HAD TO REDUCE ARE ACTUALLY -- GET RID OF BECAUSE OF THE DWINDLING BUDGET AND ONE THING IN THE B. C. P. THAT WE PUT IN WAS TO AUGMENT THAT BY A MILLION DOLLARS TO ACTUALLY DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHICH IS. GO OUT AND ACTUALLY STAND THERE AND WATCH THE TRAINING TO ENSURE THE FACT THESE THE QUALITY IS THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT'S ONE OF OUR OUR BIG TARGETS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO RECOGNIZE THAT. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WITH OUR WITH OUR BUDGET. AM WE'VE GONE FROM A HUNDRED THIRTY SOMETHING INDIVIDUALS OUT. TO ONE EIGHTEEN EN WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO AND WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST PROGRAM IN PLACE ON HOW WE WILL EXPAND THIS MONEY. WHICH IS IN -- WE EVEN INTO THE THE PAPERWORK THEM THAT WE PROVIDE YOU AND ALSO MANAGE TESTIMONY. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE THE WAY WE ENVISION THIS IS YOU'RE NOT JUST HAVE STANDALONE COURSES FOR THESE PARTICULAR PROCEDURE JUSTICE THE ESCALATION MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BUT TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO EVERY PORTION OF POST TRAINING FROM THE TIME THAT THEY GO TO THE ACADEMY TO THE TIME THEY'RE AN EXECUTIVE. THAT TO ME IS GOING TO TURN OUT A MORE A BETTER WELL ROUNDED INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE DECISIONS THE MATURITY LEVEL -- THIS IS EXACTLY THE PROGRAM THAT WE WANT TO PUT FORWARD TO YOU IN THE B. C. P. THAT MAY NOT BE OUTLINED AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE SEEN BUT WE HAVE -- IS GOING TO TURN OUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING. FOR AND THAT'S THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ME. IF IF I MAY ADD ON TO A WITNESS SANDOVAL SAID. MADAM CHAIR SO EVERY. LIVING [inaudible] SO. WHAT YOU DESCRIBED IS THAT THE ASSESSMENTS. AND AGAIN NOT TO JUST JUMP TO A CONCLUSION BUT WITHOUT HAVING YOU GIVE MORE EXPLANATION I GOT ASSUME THERE'S NO QUALITY ASSESSMENT GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE CASE. THAT IS CORRECT THERE'S NOBODY RECESSED MOTION OF THAT THERE THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM. HAS NOT BEEN FUNDED AT POST. THERE IS QUALITY ASSESSMENT WITH THE TRAINING MANAGERS THROUGHOUT THE REGIONS THROUGHOUT THEIR OWN TRAINING PROGRAMS. BUT AS FAR AS A SENDING INDIVIDUALS. TO OUTSIDE OF JUST THE REGULAR -- COURSES WE DO MONITOR THE POLICE ACADEMIES. WE DO MONITOR OUR LEGACY COURSES BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL AGENCY THERE'S OVER. 400-040-00300 COURSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP A TIGHT CLOSE LID ON THEM AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE TO BECAUSE OF THE DWINDLING RESOURCES AND AND FINANCIAL. IMPACT POST. IF I CAN ADD MADAM CHAIR EVERY COURSE THERE'S A SURVEY THAT'S DONE EITHER FOR THE ONLINE COURSES OR THE AND PERSON COURSES THAT WE REVIEW. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA SLI IS ONE OF OUR FOUNDATIONAL INSTRUCTION COURSES IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY IT'S EIGHT MONTHS OF TRAINING FOR IT SERGEANTS. ARM. JUST REVIEWING THOSE OUTLINES WE PICKED UP ON A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM LAST YEAR. BUT THE OUTLINES BY REVIEWING THOSE SUMMARIES WE GOT RID OF WELL WE GOT RID OF A PERSON WAS. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO DO ANYMORE SLI TRAINING FORCE BASED ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE FINDING. SO WE ARE REVIEWING ALL THE SURVEYS. THEY'RE BEING DONE AFTER THE COURSE IS COMPLETE AND A WHAT MISS SANDOVAL SAID IS CORRECT IS IF IF THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT WE START HEARING ABOUT WHERE WE HAD INDEPENDENT PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND I DID SOME OF THESE COURSES OR WHEN WE SEE THAT THEIR SMOKE COMING. IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION WE COULD SEND PEOPLE WE DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY BUT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE AN ABILITY ANYMORE BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS. WE DO SAID POST STAFF JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA WE SUPPOSE STAFF MEMBER. TWO MONTHS AGO. TO COME OFF LINE TO GO SIT ON A COURSE WHERE WE HAD HEARD RUMBLINGS. THAT THE INSTRUCTOR THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING THE COURSE WASN'T THE INSTRUCTOR IT WASN'T. IT WASN'T THE INSTRUCTOR THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LISTED THAT THEY WERE SELLING THEIR WARES FROM THEIR PRIVATE COMPANY YOU KNOW FOR THE FIRST X. AMOUNT OF MINUTES. THAT THEIR T. SHIRTS IN THE BACK YOU KNOW MARKETING THEIR COMPANY. SO WE TOOK HIM OFF LINE. BUT THAT WAS ONE INDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBER THAT HAD TO GO DO THAT WHEN WE HEARD OF A PROBLEM. SO WE DO WANT TO DO MORE OF THAT AND THE OTHER THING NOT JUST WHEN THERE'S PROBLEMS WE WANT TO KNOW THAT OUR TRAINING IS GOOD QUALITY TRAINING AND THAT'S WHAT WE PUT INTO THE B. C. P. WE WANT PEOPLE. TO GO IN AND LOOK AT FIVE OF OUR DE ESCALATION COURSES AND TELL US WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM NOT JUST TO TELL US WHETHER THE PERSON SELLING. CHALLENGE COINS DURING THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR PRESENTATION. BUT ARM IT'S A CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS MISS SANDOVAL POINTED BUT WE DO GET WE DO ASK FOR RESPONSES FOR EVERY COURSE. COMPLETION. I'M GIVING YOUR REFERENCE. TO I'M THERE IS. IN THE B. C. P. THE FOURSOME LATER -- THAT I MENTIONED -- I KNOW THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE THE VIRTUES. THAT. TYPE OF EQUIPMENT WHICH IS A VIRTUAL REALITY EQUIPMENT. IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT -- USE OF FORCES TRAINED ON SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS. WHO IS MAKING BE -- WHO? WHO ARE USING TO MAKE THE ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER? IT IS THE BEST TRAINING APPROACH. AND WHETHER THE EQUIPMENT THAT EITHER YOU HAVE -- YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE. TO BE ACQUIRING. IS THE BEST APPROACH OKAY. NO IT. I BELIEVE IT'S A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH WITH THE SIMULATORS -- SO. ONE THE EQUIPMENT HAS TO BE GOOD EQUIPMENT RIGHT I DON'T THINK VIRTUAL REALITY EQUIPMENT IS NECESSARILY WORDS SHOULD BE. THE FOR SUCTION SIMULATORS ARE GOOD BUT THE SCENARIOS. ARE PROBABLY WHAT WE ALL WOULD LIKE. INTO ITS INSTRUCTOR IT'S IT'S PUSHING THE BUTTON ON THE MACHINE TO PROVIDE PROPER INSTRUCTION AND FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF COVER AND CONCEALMENT DID YOU CONSIDER THIS DID YOU CONSIDER THAT OR THEY JUST HIT PLAY ON THE MACHINE. AND GOOD YOU DID A GOOD JOB AND WALK OUT SO IT'S A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. WE HAVE AN INSTRUCTOR COURSE FOR THOSE SIMULATORS ARM. THAT I DON'T BELIEVE HAS BEEN FUNDED -- BUT IT'S THERE I THINK WE TRAINED. IN A COUPLE HUNDRED OFFICERS A YEAR ON THAT COURSE. BUT IT'S ALL OF THAT THAT MAKES IT WORK PROPERLY. SO PART OF MY QUESTION IS SO ARE WE SO WHAT I'M UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS THAT. IT IS INTERNAL POST STAFF. THAT WOULD BE DOING THOSE ASSESSMENTS [inaudible] I'M. AND I'M NOT THE NO JUDGMENT ON THIS NO NO OPINION ON IT BUT VERSUS SAY AN EXTERNAL. ENTITY THAT YOU MIGHT. CONTRACT WITH OR SOMETHING SO IT'S INTERNAL POST STAFF THAT DO BOTH THE ASSESSMENTS INSTRUCTOR IN SUCH. SEC BRECHT RIGHT WE HAVE. ONE GOING ALONG WITH -- SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. SO WE ONCE WE CAN TRY AND NARROW THINGS DOWN TO CERTAIN VENDORS. WE WILL BRING IN INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO COME IN AND LOOK AT IT PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE FIELD. DOING THE JOB CURRENTLY AS WELL AS OUR POST STAFF. ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAW THAT YOU MENTION ABOUT THE FORCE OFTEN SIMILAR SCENARIOS WE WANT TO DO FOR HIS NEW SCENARIOS A YEAR WITH THE ABILITY TO HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL MAKE A DECISION. AND I THEY MAKE ONE DECISION THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING DOWN ONE PATH OF MAKE A DECISION OTHER DECISION ARE TAKING ON DIFFERENT PATHS. FIRST IS -- WHAT SENATOR BILL JUST WENT THROUGH WHICH WAS A SHOOT DON'T SHOOT? THOSE DON'T DO A WHOLE LOT FOR DECISION MAKING PROCESSES AND DEVELOPING MATURITY ON THE HAVE A ON BEHALF OF THE POLICE OFFICER. SO IT'S KIND OF INTERNAL AS WELL AS IT WILL BE EXTERNAL BECAUSE WE DO NEED. OUR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS TO HAVE BY AND AND AND GIVE US THAT THE CURRENT PRACTICES. NOBODY I THINK AGAIN. GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION. IN TERMS OF THE WHILE. WELL THERE WAS NOT [inaudible] ON A POLICY DIRECTIVE AS TO WHAT THE WHAT AM I A S. HOW DO I COMMUNICATE THIS THAT. WELL THERE WASN'T A A POLICY DIRECTIVE IN ALL RIGHT HERE IS WHAT THE OF FLOOR. FOR USE OF FORCE INDIA ESCALATION TRAINING SHOULD BE. THE THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAS MORE [inaudible] TOWARD JUST. IMPROVE AN INCREASE AND FOCUS ON IT [inaudible] BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE IN PLACE BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH. THE NEW SCENARIOS [inaudible] RIGHT THOSE. SO. I THINK THE THE MISSING COMPONENT WITH IT IS THE EQUIPMENT AT THIS BY RIGHT SO THE SCENARIOS ACROSS THE STATE ARE STANDARDIZED POSTED AREAS WE TRAIN. THE INSTRUCTORS ON THOSE POSTING AREAS AND HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO USE THE MACHINES AND WHAT TOPICS ARE SUPPOSED TO HEAR WHAT. AREAS ARE SUPPOSED YES BUT WE'VE JUST GIVEN YOU WE'VE GIVEN YOU A NEW DIRECTOR OF AGAIN WITHOUT. A LOT OF DETAIL REGARDING YOU KNOW WHAT MODIFICATIONS IN POLICY THERE MIGHT BE. BUT THAT MIGHT THEN INFORM. WHAT THE SCENARIOS ARE RIGHT. IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY. YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE SCENARIOS IN PLACE WELL WE SHOULD HAVE THE THE HE RIVER. REVAMPS NEW ENHANCE RIVER CURRICULUMS. IN PLACE. THAT WOULD HELP THEN INFORM THE WITH THOSE SCENARIOS ARE IF GIVEN AGAIN THAT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. ONE TIME ONLY WAS NOT JUST FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY. IT WAS FOR ENHANCING POSTS ABILITY TO DO TRAINING REGARDING USE OF COURSE. ANTI ESCALATION AND I'M SURE THERE IS A COUPLE OF THE THINGS I DON'T HAVE THE LANGUAGE. DIRECTLY BEFORE BY. THOSE -- THOSE SIMULATORS ARE. THAT'S PART OF WHAT THEY ARE USED. FOR YEAH ONE PART NOT THE ONLY. YEAH. SO IT'S KIND OF THE POINT I'M MAKING. THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS. AND AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL DO BUT WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF BILLS BEFORE US. THAT COULD -- COULD. WEIGH IN ON WHAT EITHER ON SOME FOCUSES ON TRAINING OR SOME CHANGES IN USE OF FORCE RULES. I WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW. I SUPPOSE IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT SO THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO RE CREATE TRAINING LATER. SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT TAKING A POSITION ON EITHER OF COURSE NOT EITHER BILL -- YOU KNOW. I THINK WE'RE IN A POSITION WE HAVE PLENTY OF USE OF FORCE -- OF A FOUNDATION ON USE OF FORCE TRAINING PRIMARILY FROM THE BASIC ACADEMY. THE WE WILL INCORPORATE INTO WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED YOUR DOESN'T SIGN I THINK WE'LL BE IN A IN A GOOD POSITION SO. ADMITTEDLY WERE WAITING TO SEE WHAT -- WHAT ULTIMATELY TRANSPIRES BUT WE FEEL LIKE? WHICHEVER WAY GOES WILL BE READY -- IN TERMS OF THE EQUIPMENT IS GOING BACK TO THE FIRST PART -- WE'RE COMMITTED TO PURCHASING NEW NEW SIMULATORS AND MAYBE THAT WILL DRIVE. YOU KNOW THAT'LL BE THAT THE CARD THAT DRIVES THE HORSE BY GETTING THE NEW SIMULATORS IN THIS NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- BUT I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT ALL HAPPEN WE ALREADY HAVE THE INSTRUCTIONAL PIECE WE ALREADY HAVE THE X.. THE EXPERTISE SO TO SPEAK WITH THE MACHINES ARM WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE GET THE THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT WE DON'T WANT THEM. ALWAYS THE MONEY [inaudible] AND OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUE ENTER MORE LACK. QUESTION FOR A MISLI -- ON ON THE REPORT WE HAVE FIVE PAGE. SEVEN OUT WE'RE STILL USING PARENTHESES AROUND SUB TOTALS AND OF BEING AN ACCOUNTANT THAT'S REALLY IRRITATING TO ME AND I'M JUST WONDERING WILL THE NEW. LA OF CHANGE THE FORMAT THE JUSTIN UNDERLINE IT AND THEN A DOUBLE UNDERLINED FOR THE TOTAL LIKE IN MOST ACCOUNTANTS DO OR WE'RE GONNA STAY WITH THE SYSTEM -- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE DISCUSSED WITH THE NEW LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. IN OUR SCHEDULE APPOINTMENT THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME -- WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT OPEN. AND APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND CLEARLY YOU KNOW SOME OF THE CONCERNS. THAT WE HAVE FOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AWESOME ALL RIGHT MANAGER THANK YOU -- WE ARE NOW -- I THINK WE'RE GONNA RETURN TO THE FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA SIX NINETY ISSUE ONE ISSUE -- TWO WE ARE HOPING TO TAKE ACTION ON THOSE BUT CERTAINLY -- THE MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE. QUESTIONS BEFORE WE ENTERTAIN A VOTE ON ON THEY ARE THE FEDERAL FIND. AUGMENTATION. FOR THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ALL RIGHTS FOR THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM ON AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE REQUEST THAT'S ISSUE. TO WE CAN DO A MESS TO DIFFERENT -- WE HAVE TO TWO DIFFERENT MOTION SIR GREEN MOVEMENTS. ONE I THINK WE COULD MOVE MESS -- ONE YEAH. OKAY SO WE HAVE MOTION ON BOTH THOSE ITEMS THERE WERE -- WE OBVIOUSLY WILL GET TO LOOK AT OUR THE LANGUAGE IN -- THE APPROVAL IN CASE WE WANT TO ADD -- ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IF WE WANT TO AND END UP ADDING REPORTING LANGUAGE I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO SPECIFY THAT IN THIS MOTION BUT WE CAN ALWAYS. DISCUSS THAT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BILL. BUT SO WILL -- WE HAVE A MOTION NOW WILL DO A ROLL CALL IN THIS IS ON APPROVING. ISSUE ONE ISSUE TWO IS BUDGET. CENTER SKINNER HI UNDER MORE LOCK. SENATE ABOUT. ALL RIGHT SO NOW WE WILL MOVE. TO ON THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES EVEN THOUGH THOSE WERE ITEMS ON THAT BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD ISSUE. FOR AND THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL. ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATION OF VICTIM SERVICES. SO I'M ACTUALLY GONNA OPEN THIS ONE OUT FOR EVERYONE I'M GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I'M. MANAGING WORTH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M GOING TO GIVE LIKE A BRIEF OVERVIEW FOR EVERYONE AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENTS TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE REPORT ITSELF. I CALIFORNIA IS A NATIONAL LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO OUR VICTIMS PROGRAMS AND MANY STE IN MANY STATES THAT WANT TO EMULATE. CALIFORNIA'S RECEIVED A LARGE INFLUX OF FEDERAL DOLLARS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE HELP SUPPORT MORE THAN EIGHTY VICTIMS SERVICES PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE HAVE ONE OF THE OLDEST AND SECOND LARGEST VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAMS IN THE NATION. I THINK WE AS A STAY ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE BEST POSSIBLE SERVICE FOR VICTIMS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATION RECENTLY THAT SHOWS THE LEGISLATURE'S AS WELL AS THE MINISTRATIONS CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING VICTIMS. AB TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR A BUDGET BUDGET TRAILER BILL FROM LAST YEAR -- PROVIDES VICTIMS AND THE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS OF THE GOLDEN STATE COLOR. OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION YEARS PAST THE THREE YEAR DEADLINE TO TO THE ARREST OF THE SUSPECT IN THE CASE. AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR REQUIRES VZV OR THE VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD TO USE THE INTEGRATED TRAUMA RECOVERY SERVICES MODEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE SAN FRANCISCO TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER. WHEN IT PROVIDES GRANTS TO TRY TO TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS I THINK THIS MODEL IS SEEN AS A BEST PRACTICES MODEL IN THE STATE? ANOTHER ONE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS AS THE EIGHT FORTY WHICH IS LAST YEAR'S. BUDGET BILL SB EIGHT FORTY PER INCLUDED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO DEVELOP OPTIONS AND A RECOMMENDATION FOR COMBINING THE VICTIMS ESTATES VICTIMS PROGRAMS. I THINK THERE ARE MANY COMPONENTS TO THE OPTIONS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED AND I TINK WE NEED TO EXERCISE CAUTION. SO WE CAN MAKE A WELL INFORMED DECISION. I'M THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND WHILE THE WORKING GROUP RECOMMENDED A TWO TO THREE YEAR CONSOLIDATION. WE ARE ALREADY MAKING GREAT PROGRESS ON SHARING INFORMATION AND COLLABORATING COLLABORATING ON VICTIMS ISSUES. THE ADMINISTRATION IS VERY FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING VICTIMS OF CRIME AND THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THEM. SO WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS TOPIC IN MORE DETAIL IN THE COMING MONTHS -- WITHOUT ALTERNATE OVER -- TO YES NBC PEAS SO THEY CAN ELABORATE ON THE WORKING GROUP EFFORTS THE PROCESS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT. REMEMBER YOU START I THINK WHAT -- ALL NOTE FOR MY COLLEAGUES IS THAT. THE ITEM INDICATES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN WAS TO COME BACK TO US WITH REPORT ON THIS CONSOLIDATION IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY THEN I MEAN IF WE HAVE -- FROM HEARING TODAY IF WE HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE DIRECTION WE OF COURSE CAN. A COMMONER INVOLVE OURSELVES BUT OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE THE REPORT IN DECEMBER AND THUS NEXT YEAR WE WOULD BE ABLE. TO HAVE A HEARING. YOU KNOW HOW INCLUDE IT IN A HEARING AND BE ABLE TO GET INTO MORE DETAIL AROUND WHETHER WE WOULD WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THAT. WASTE THAT THE TWO ENTITIES CONSOLIDATED THEIR SERVICES OR NOT BUT WE AT LEAST WILL CAN HEAR SOME MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY PLANNED BUT WILL GET THE REPORT IN DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN CORRECT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS IS JUST THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE WORKING GROUP -- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS TOLD STILL TAKING A DEEP DIVE INTO WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AND I WILL CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH YOU GUYS THROUGHOUT THE REST THE SPRING. EARLY BUT WE WILL GET A REPORT DECEMBER. TWENTY NINETEEN IT IS A RECOMMENDATION FROMTHEM -- FROM THE WORKING GROUP AND SO WE ARE WORKING AS ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THEM -- TO WORK ON OF A PLAN. WE HOPE TO GET A REPORT IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN BUT YOU MAY ERCENT SURE I'LL INTRODUCE MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE INTRODUCED HERSELF I'M JULIE NAM AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE -- OFFICER THE VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD. GOOD GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS GRACE COKE I AM THE CHIEF DEPUTY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. SO WE AGREE WERE JUST CONCURRENT SURE OF THE TIME HERE WITH YOU -- AND FOLLOWING UP ON THE COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE I JUST GIVE YOU JUST A FEW PIECES OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS REPORT CAME ABOUT. BEING DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WHO PARTICIPATED THE METHODOLOGY WE USED TO DEVELOP IT. AND THEN GRACE WILL REVIEW WITH YOU ARE THE PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION COMING OUT OF THE AYE REPORT AND SOME COLLABORATIVE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING SINCE THAT TIME. SO IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF THE BUDGET -- WE ASSEMBLED A WORKING GROUP CONSISTING OF THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND THE VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD AND WE MET REGULARLY OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL WEEKS DEVELOPING THE METHODOLOGY FOR THIS AM STUDY -- WE ENGAGED OUR STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE IS IT'S NOT A NEW ISSUE IT'S PAN LOOKED AT MANY TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS SO IT WAS CRITICAL TO US TO BUILD IN A STAKEHOLDER. ENGAGEMENT INTO THE PROCESS SIR WE ADMINISTERED A SURVEY -- TO OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED I'M STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ASKING THEM A SERIES OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR REACTIONS TO A POTENTIAL A CONSOLIDATION OF THESE SERVICES FROM THESE TWO STATE ENTITIES. ARM IN ADDITION WE HELD -- THREE FORMS FOR STAKEHOLDERS -- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ONE IN SACRAMENTO WHEN IN OAKLAND ONE LOS ANGELES IN LATE AUGUST AND EARLY SEPTEMBER ALSO -- TO PRESENT SOME IDEAS THAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT AS WE WERE PULLING THE REPORT TOGETHER AND GETTING THEIR THEIR FEEDBACK. WE ALSO CONSULTED WITH OTHER STATES -- BOTHOF OUR PROGRAMS ARE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST. ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- VIEWS THAT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. SOME STATES ORGANIZE THEM THOSE TWO PROGRAMS DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO AND WE CONSULTED WITH A VARIETY OF STATES INCLUDING NEW YORK PENNSYLVANIA SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. TO LEARN FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE OF LOOKING A CONSOLIDATION AND WHAT THE PROPOSED WHETHER IT WAS AN ACTIVE BUT IF THEY FELT THAT AT THAT CONSOLIDATION WAS -- IMPROVEMENT AND MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO DELIVER SERVICES IN THEIR STATE. SO WE ADAM WENT THROUGH THAT PROCESS -- TO INSURE THAT WE WERE AND TESTING OF THIS CONCEPT WITH OTHERS WHO HAD DONE SO IN THE PAST. SO THOSE WERE THE THE THE WITH THOSE ARE THE WAYS THAT WE WENT ABOUT -- DEVELOPING THIS YOU'LL YOU NOTED IN THE STUDY WE ALSO GIVE YOU A A DISCUSSION OF THE MANY. PREVIOUS AT AS STUDIES AND REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON THIS TOPIC SO TAKING OFF OF THOSE WITHIN CONSULTED WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND ULTIMATELY. CAME UP WITH A NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ALTERNATIVE RIGOROUS. WELL SURE BUT JUST BRIEFLY DISTURB SOME CONTEXT FOR THE RULES RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR OFFICES AS A VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD PROVIDES DIRECT COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS. THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES GRANT PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS SERVICES PROVIDE FUNDING AND SERVICES. TO DIRECT -- TO THOSE WHO PERFORM DIRECT SERVICES TO VICTIMS SO WE SUPPORT THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE VICTIMS. SO THERE'S THERE'S TO A UNIQUE -- ASPECTS TO TO THIS COORDINATED ROLE -- SO WE HAD MINISTER THOSE PROGRAMS. IN A VARIETY OF WAYS WE AS WAS TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATION AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT. OF THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES HAS ESTABLISHED FIVE ADVISORY COMMITTEES. TO INFORM AND HELP IDENTIFY THE GAPS IN FUNDING AND SERVICES SO WE USE OF STAKE HOLDERS MULTI DISCIPLINE GROUPS TO HELP INFORM THOSE GAPS. AND THOSE -- THERE'S FIVE FIVE AND COMMITTEES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE A REPORT ON AND AS WELL ASAS WAS MENTIONED THE INCREASE OF FUNDING. RIGHT RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO MAXIMIZE AND LEVERAGE THE FUNDING FROM THE VICTIMS OF POINT OF VIEW. SO -- WE ARE WE ARE SENATORS FIVE OF THE SIX MAIN FORMULA GRANT PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS SERVICES INCLUDING THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT ASSISTANCE FORMULA GRANT PROGRAM. SERVICES TRAINING OFFICERS PROSECUTION STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN FORMULA GRANT PROGRAM SEXUAL ASSAULT SERVICES FORMULA PROGRAM CHILD JUSTICE ACT GRANTS TO STATE PROGRAMS AND FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION SERVICES. GRANTS TO STATES FOR DEVELOPMENT THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS AND SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM. SO WE'VE ESTABLISHED APPROXIMATELY AT EIGHTY SIX DIFFERENT VICTIM SERVICES AND PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAMS AND HAVE APPROXIMATELY TWELVE HUNDRED DIFFERENCE OF RECIPIENTS. THAT ARE DELIVERING THOSE DIRECT SERVICES TO VICTIMS THROUGHOUT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AS WELL AS TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND THE TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO BETTER EQUIPPED AND PREPARE FIRST RESPONDERS -- AND THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO WORK WITH VICTIMS OF CRIME AND IMPROVE THEIR RESPONSE. AND THERE'S ALSO A DIVERSITY OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO REACH SOME OF THE UNDER REPRESENTED. A POPULATIONS GROUPS -- OVER TWO HUNDRED THE RECIPIENTS ARE PROVIDING -- THOSE SERVICES. TO A NON PROFITS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- SURROUNDING SUPPORT TO A VARIETY OF OF DIVERSE PROGRAMS SO. WITH OVER MORE THAN 56% OF VICTIMS BEING UNDER OUR NON REPORTED. IT ONE OF THE PIVOTAL FOUNDATIONS OF OUR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION IS TO ENSURE THAT THE VICTIMS CAN ACCESS A VARIETY OF TRAUMA INFORMED VICTIM CENTERED SERVICE IN A SETTING THAT IS COMFORTABLE FOR THEM. SO THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE IN. IN REPORTING AND GETTING SUPPORT FROM THOSE THAT CAN HELP THEM AND ARE EQUIPPED TO HELP THEM AND RECOVER FROM FROM THOSE THOSE CRIMES. AND SO THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH OUR VICTIMS COMPENSATION PARTNERS AS WELL AS SOME OF OUR OTHER STATE AGENCY PARTNERS. THAT -- THAT ALSO HAVE SERVICES FOR THE VICTIMS OR THEIR FAMILIES. SO IN THE REPORT THERE WERE A FEW OPTIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED THAT REALLY TOOK A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES WHEN WAS WAS. DOING NOTHING WAS NOT AN OPTION I THINK ONE THING IN GOVERNMENT IS THAT WE COULD ALWAYS DO BETTER AND IF WE LISTEN TO THOSE THE RECEIVER SERVICES. AND FROM THOSE THAT PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES WE CAN DO BETTER TO REACH MORE AND AND HELP THOSE IN NEED -- THERE IS THE CONSOLIDATION WITHIN ONE OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS OR THE ENTIRE OR CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW ENTITY. AND THEN WHAT WE REALLY FOCUSED IN ON IS WORKING TO STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICES AND CONDUCTING A PHASED APPROACH TO CONSOLIDATION WITH THE KEY EMPHASIS OF THAT GREATER COLLABORATION. WHICH WE HEARD FROM AS WE CONDUCTED THOSE OUR REACH OFFENSE AND SURVEYS IS THAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY AND TO BE LISTENED TO AND REALLY TAKING THEIR INPUT AND ADVICE AND THEN PROGRAMMING GOES INTO OUR RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS -- HAVING GONE THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT CONSOLIDATIONS I WITHIN -- YES SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND FOUR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW IS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THOSE THAT WE SERVE AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND DO IT VERY METHODICALLY SO APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE SHOULDN'T. SUPPORT AND ATTENTION TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT AS WE WORK THROUGH BUT AS WE SAID DOING NOTHING WAS NOT AN OPTION AND THAT GREATER COLLABORATION. AS A JUST A FEW OF THE RESULTS OF THAT COLLABORATION -- INCLUDE ART JOINT PRESENTATIONS AS WE HAVE SIMILAR STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES FROM BOTH DEPARTMENTS WE ARE CONDUCTING MORE WEBINARS AND TRAINING AND MEETING VENUES TO INCLUDE THEM SO THAT WE'RE ALL SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE FROM THE VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE. IN FACT OTHERS A JOINT WEAPON ARE SCHEDULED FOR APRIL SEVENTEENTH AND TWENTY SECOND TO GET INPUT AND FEEDBACK FROM THE FIELD AND THOSE THAT WE SERVE. TO BETTER INFORM OUR SERVICE DELIVERY AND SOME OF OUR OUR EXISTING AND OUR NEW PROGRAMS -- WE'VE ADDED THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF OF SOME OF OUR THE STEERING COMMITTEES THAT I MENTIONED -- FOR VOCA INVOLVED SO THAT THEY CAN HELP -- BE AT THE TABLE WITH OUR MULTI DISCIPLINE PARTNERS. WE ALSO ARE WORKING ON A JOINT REGIONAL TRAININGS. BEAT SO THAT ARE OUR PARTNERS THE NON PROFITS LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES CAN KNOW ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AS A REACHING OUT TO THOSE VICTIMS. AND WE'RE ALSO COLLABORATING ON A ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO MAKE SURE AS WE HAVE IN STATE RESPONSE TO MASS CASUALTIES INCIDENT AT THE STATE LEVEL. THAT WE ARE COORDINATED AND UNIFIED AND THAT APPROACH -- WE'RE ADDING LANGUAGE AND OUR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS THAT GO OUT TO OUR OUR SUB RECIPIENT SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO SEEK THOSE THAT COME FROM VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD AND THOSE THAT COME FROM -- YES AND THAT THOSE MIGHT EXIST WITHIN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES OVER THE CITIES THAT THAT OFFER ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS SO IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT IT FROM AN ALL INCLUSIVE APPROACH TO HOW WE MEET THE SERVICES -- AND THE STUDY REALLY HELPED INFORM THAT AND WE HAVE NOW -- A JOINT COMMITMENT WITH THAT CAN KIND OF A A SHARED GOAL OF WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS HEARING FROM THEM TO STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES. AND WITH THEIR INPUT AND REALLY WORKING TO BENEFIT THOSE THAT WE COLLECTIVELY SIR SO NOW IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BOTH OF OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE HAPPY TO ENGAGE. AS WE GO OUT THROUGH THE YEAR AND CONTINUE THIS TO ENGAGE IN OTHER CONVERSATIONS ON THE MORE DETAILS OF THE REPORT. A CONSOLIDATION DISCUSSIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR PROGRAMS. AND SO WITH THAT I WILL CLOSE [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. THAT ARE MORE LIKE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MAYBE AGAIN JUST GETTING REAL FUNDAMENTAL BUT WE SHOULD MISS HAVE BEEN DONE YEARS AGO. WELL AS YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN -- TO TO CONSOLIDATE AND IN FACT -- IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WAS OF WHEN THE OFFICE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE FUNDING WAS CONSOLIDATED INTO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. I DO TOO ARE THE CAPABILITY OF OF GRANT MANAGEMENT AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MULTI AGENCY COORDINATION -- SO I THINK THERE'S BEEN INTERESTS OF PROGRESS MADE IN IMPROVING THE PROGRAM BUT I THINK USING THAT INFORMATION TO INFORM. I'M WITH THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO DO I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS AND THE CHALLENGES -- IS THAT IT REALLY TAKES A LOT. A AND AND BEING MINDFUL OF THE IMPACTS TO THOSE THAT WE SERVE THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. OF THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO TO VICTIMS -- AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE SENSITIVE TO ALL THE DETAILS AGO INTO CONSOLIDATION. I AM I WOULD AGREE AND I THINK THAT'S I'M GONNA UNDERPINS THE ARE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE NOT MOVE QUICKLY TO TO CONSOLIDATION -- RECOGNIZING THAT THIS REPORT WAS DUE TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE IN OCTOBER AFTER IT JULY FIFTEENTH -- BUDGET IS A VER SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO REALLY ADEQUATELY EXAMINED HOW CONSOLIDATION MIGHT ACTUALLY OCCUR SO MANY DETAILS BECAUSE BOTH OF US. RECEIVE SO MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH DIFFERENT -- ENTITIES WITHIN. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- UP AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I'M SO IS A LOT OF DETAILS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT AND WE WERE SENSITIVE TO THAT -- AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT ANY DELAYS IN FUNDING BECAUSE OF TRANSITIONING OR GRANT AWARDS FROM ONE DEPARTMENT TO ANOTHER MY BECAUSE OUR STAKEHOLDERS. THAT'S WHY I IN THE AYE AYE DETAIL THE RECOMMENDATION OF SAYS THIS REALLY OUGHT TO BE STUDIED MORE AND ARGO THROUGH EITHER GOVERNOR'S REORGANIZATION PLAN OR A LEGISLATIVE -- CHANGE AND THAT THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. NOT PUTTING THEIR SPECIFIC TIME FRAME ON IT BUT AS AS GRACE AS INDICATED IN THE SHORTER TERM. NOT WAITING FOR THAT TO HAPPEN WE HAVE REALLY RAMPED UP OUR EFFORTS. TO TO COORDINATE OUR ACTIVITIES IN A MORE VISIBLE MORE TRANSPARENT WAY SO THAT VICTIMS AND THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ADMINISTER PROGRAMS. REALLY KNOW THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS UNITED ON THIS AND THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ARE COMMITTED TO DELIVERING THE BEST SERVICS POSSIBLE. SO WHETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE MESSY BECAUSE IT'S IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES WE'RE TRYING -- TO PRESENT AND PROVIDE THESE PROGRAMS IN KIND OF A A SEAMLESS MANNER SO THAT WHATEVER OUR ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES DON'T BECOME A CHALLENGE OF THE VICTIMS. SO WHEN YOU MERGING DEPARTMENT WITH ANOTHER DEPARTMENT YOU HAVE. HOPEFULLY THE ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATE POSITIONS. THE HOUSE AT BEING ADDRESSED WELL THOSE ARE THE VERY KEY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THERE'S ISSUES OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES SYSTEMS AND H. R. OFFICES AND ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE IN -- TO DEPARTMENTS -- SO THOSE WILL ALL BE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE LOOKED AT AND THEY NEED TO BE LOOKED AT CAREFULLY AND REALLY PLANNED OUT. AND NOT JUST ASSUME THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO DO IT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS WE REALLY WANT TO PLAN IT OUT PLAN IT OUT WELL. ARE YOU BOTH USING THIS CAL YES WE ARE AS I WORKING FOR YOU IT'S WORKING. YES WE WERE WE WERE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE OF THE FIRST FIRMS WERE IN WAVE. ONE AND THE WE'RE DOING FINE THAT'S FOR THEIR SAKE YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] SO THE IT WAS THE BUDGET ACTION OF LAST YEAR. THAT DIRECTED THIS -- WERE -- DELIBERATE EFFORT TOWARDS CONSOLIDATION. AND WHILE IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT. YOU KNOW THESE THINGS CAN'T JUST BE DONE OVERNIGHT. THE WHY I RE ITERATED THE EXPECTATION OF THE REPORT BY DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN IS CERTAINLY. A THAT'S MORE THAN A YEAR AND A HALF. YOU KNOW THAT WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE -- TO THE IF WE WERE TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE. TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE. DOUBLE OR TRIPLE YOUR SIZED. I'D HAVE MORE OF A YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT COULD TAKE A FEW YEARS AND YOU ALL DO SOME -- VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY. DETAILED WORK IN CLEARLY GET GRANTS FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS BUT YOU'RE IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS IN TERMS AGES ARE NOT THAT LARGE SO. LET'S GET THE REPORT IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETY IS LA -- HAVE ANY COMMENT. ONE PERSON AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS -- WE DO YOU THINK THIS REPORT IS A GOOD FIRST STEP -- CLEARLY THE THE AGENCIES WENT TO QUITE A BIT OF EFFORT TO DO OUTREACH TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHERS -- IT DOES SEEM THAT YOU KNOW IT THAT. ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW THIS WOUL HAPPEN IS IMPORTANT GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES -- HOWEVER WE DO THINK THAT THE MAIN LIMITATION HERE OF COURSE IS THAT THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY ON EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THIS CONSOLIDATION WHERE WOULD GO -- WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN THOSE KINDS OF DETAILS SO WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DECEMBER REPORT WE THINK THAT'S CRITICAL ON TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE ASKED -- FOR BOTH IN SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE FIRST AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY IN BUDGET BILLING WHICH SHOWED THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE IT CLEAR A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR THEM TO TO HAVE A REPORT ON SO WE THINK WE THINK THAT DECEMBER REPORT IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND WHEN THE THE LEGISLATURE DOES REVIEW THAT REPORT WE CONTINUE TO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE ONE ENTITY REALLY FOCUSED ON VICTIMS PROGRAMS AND SO -- SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THAT -- AND AND HOW THAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITHIN THAT REPORT -- ALSO JUST IN TERMS OF THAT THE SHORT TERM RECOMMENDATIONS CERTAINLY SEEMS REASONABLE TO DO SOME SOME INNER ON THINGS AND AND GENERALLY SEEM REASONABLE JUST ONE WHAT KIND OF ISSUE THAT TO THINK ABOUT IS -- AND POTENTIALLY AS THE DEPARTMENTS AS IF THERE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THOSE INTERIM SUCH SOLUTIONS BECAUSE REALLY WE VIEW THOSE AS INTERIM SOLUTIONS AND SO -- IF THEY ARE IF THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE -- THAT SHOULD BE PROBABLY WAIT IN THAT CONTEXT. I'M CHAIR IF I MAY I JUST HAVE TO REITERATE THAT THE THE DECEMBER REPORT IS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE WORKING GROUP BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S NECESSARILY COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION NOT A REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED I THINK WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WORKING WITH THEM -- BUT AGAIN I DON'T THINK THERE IS LIKE COMMITMENTS THOUGHT THAT WE WILL BE DOING OVER POOR IN DECEMBER BUT IT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US AND WE ARE WORKING WITH BOTH DEPARTMENTS. DILIGENTLY ON THIS SO -- WE WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION AS MUCH AS WE CAN BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO COMMITMENT TO A DECEMBER REPORT FROM THE MINISTRATION. RIGHT SO WHILE IT IS NOT IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT GAVE THE DIRECTION TO DO THE CONSOLIDATION DID NOT SPECIFY DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN WITH THE REPORTED DID OCTOBER EIGHTEEN WHICH WE HAVE -- A GIVEN THAT OUR INTEREST IS IN DOING THE CONSOLIDATION. BY MY REITERATING THE DESIRE FOR THAT IT GIVES US THE ABILITY IN THE RURAL THAT BE THE END OF THE NINETEEN NO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR. TO BE ABLE TO ADOPT A BUDGET THAT REFLECTS. A CONSOLIDATION. AND WITHOUT SO IT WILL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DO SO. SO. IF ARM WE'LL GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL FROM BEFORE. AND IF WE WERE NOT CLEAR ABOUT SOME DATES MAY WILL PUT SOME IN THIS YEAR. AN GO AHEAD SENATOR MORE LACK. GREAT BECAUSE THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SUGGESTION AND IN ORDER. AND I'M I'M HERE IN ORDER. TO SO I'M JUST WONDERING JUST THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH WITH NOVEMBER WORK OUT BETTER FOR YOU TO GET IT DONE. FOR OCTOBER WAS IT WOULD YOU PREFER THAT I THINK WE STILL NEED TO WORK WITHIN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT'S BUT AS ALWAYS -- THE BEST REPORTING TIME FOR FINANCES ALWAYS JANUARY BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET COMES OUT AND THAT'S USUALLY WHEN OUR PLANS COME OUT BUT AGAIN A WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE A VERY STRONG INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THESE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE -- SO YEAH I MEAN WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM AS CLOSE AS WE CAN ON THIS AND WHAT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU MANAGER AS THEY SAY DON'T QUIBBLE CIVIL AND CERTAINLY JANUARY'S NOT SO BAD COMPARED TO DECEMBER SO WHATEVER WILL HAVE THE CONVERSATION MORE WE'LL SEE WHETHER WE NEED TO PUT ANYTHING SPECIFIC AND BUDGET LANGUAGE OR NOT. THANK YOU SO MUCH BEFORE YOU GO IS A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. OKAY SEEING NINE NOW I WANT TO RETURN TO POSTS THERE MAY HAVE BEEN PUBLIC COMING UP SOON I AIRED AND DID NOT ASK FOR IT SO IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON POST. IS IF THERE IS PLEASE COME TO THE MIKE YOU CERTAINLY. I APOLOGIZE FOR MY NOT HAVING CALLED FOR IT. THE NEXT. FIVE ALL RIGHT THEN IF THERE'S NOT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT WE WILL GET TO MOVE ON AND WE WILL NOW MOVE. TO THE OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY UDER THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR FIRE APPARATUS IN MAINTENANCE SHOT. I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLKS [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] OUR I HAVE A THE STOUT AND THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND THE GOOD AFTERNOON IT SAID MITCH MEDICAID HMO DIRTY DIRECTOR FOR LOGISTICS AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE MERGING SERVICES. GREAT RED PROCEED THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU RIGHT NOW IS FOR TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND FOR A ONE TIME PURCHASE. OF THE FIRE APPARATUS MAINTENANCE SHOP. THIS IS LOCATED ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF FROM OUR HELLO YES HEADQUARTERS. THE CURRENT WE ARE CURRENTLY LEASING THE FACILITY AND THE LEASE PROVIDES CALORIE S. WITH THE OTION TO PURCHASE THE FACILITY FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF PURCHASED BY JANUARY THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT AFTER THAT DATE THE PURCHASE PRICE WOULD GO UP. I HAVE MISTER MITIGATE A CHAIR WITH ME TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SO WHAT THIS THE SHOP A CALLOW YES MAINTAINS A FLEET OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AT ENGINES CURRENTLY AND WE ALSO WATER TENDERS. OF THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED OUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY SAN WE DO THAT AS PART OF OUR OUR MUTUAL AID -- PACKAGE THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE THE SHOP -- IS WHERE WE DO THAT MAINTENANCE ON THOSE -- ON THOSE ENGINES SO ONE THIRD STREET IT LOCALLY -- LOCAL MAINTENANCE IS PERFORMED THERE BUT IT -- A LOT OF OUR MAINTENANCE THIS IS BROUGHT FOR TO OUR SITE HERE. AND THAT'S WHERE THAT SHOP TAKES PLACE IN THAT WORK IS DONE MA'AM BUT ANOTHER HUNDRED ENGINES THAT ARE. HAVE BEEN -- ALSO INBOUND THEY'RE COMING IN DIFFERENT TYPES ENGINES AND I HAVE OUR OUR CHIEF OF FIRE HERE -- CHIEF MARSHALL WITH ME IS WELFARE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON ON THAT PORTION OF IT ADDITIONALLY WE TO STOCKPILING OF SOME COMMODITIES AND SO. ARE THESE THE SAME COMMODITIES THAT I'VE USED IN PUSHED OUT TO ALL OF OUR RECENT FIRES AT YOU SEEN SO WE HAVE -- COTS BLANKETS -- WATER -- KIDS OF THAT TYPE ATTENDED CHURCH THAT I USE -- THEN WE'VE USED AND WE RESPOND ACCORDINGLY LIKE WE DID IN SANTA ROSA LIKE WE DIDN'T READING LIKE WE DID IN -- RECENTLY IN PARADISE AND OTHER AREAS AND SO I HAD THIS IS WHERE WE MAINTAIN THAT CASH. ALONG WITH THOSE VEHICLES AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY USING THIS OF THEIR WE SEE THIS IS A GOOD OVERALL INVESTMENT LONG TERM IT'S BETTER FOR THE STATE IN TERMS OF SAVING MONEY. AND ALSO AVOID ANY DISRUPTION AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE BY TRYING TO MOVE TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE LONG TERM AND CONSTANTLY RE. NO RELOCATING IS ROBBIE SEE AT THE WOMEN SUBJECT OF OF THE LANDLORD WHEN ONE OF THE SITUATION. LEASES STRUCTURE TO BUY AND WE THINK IT'S A GOOD PROPOSALS WHEN WE LOOK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. GREAT I'M I KNOW THAT. FIVE AS YOU STATED THIS IS THE BUDGET REQUEST IS TO PURCHASE THIS FACILITY VERSUS LEASING IT. AND I KNOW THAT THE LA -- RAISE THE QUESTION OF IF -- WE ARE PROCEEDING WITH THIS IN PURCHASING THEN WOULDN'T THERE BE A CONCOMITANT REDUCTION DUE TO THAT WE'RE NO LONGER LEASING. AND SO -- IT IS IS HAD YOU ALREADY FACTOR THAT IS THAT ALREADY INCORPORATED IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST OR NOT. SINCE THIS IS -- I THINK -- MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES MYSELF OF REYES NUMBER OF TIMES. WE WHENEVER WE HAVE DISCRETION -- GENERAL DISCRETIONARY GENERAL FUND USES WE ARE TRYING TO BE VERY -- CAREFUL AND SMART ABOUT HIM BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH COMPETITION FOR GENERAL FUND SO. YES MA'AM CHAIR IT'S NOT CURRENTLY INCORPORATED IN THAT PROPOSAL PORSCHE PARTIALLY BECAUSE THE PART WE ANTICIPATE PURCHASING THE FACILITY BY JANUARY THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO UP UNTIL THAT TIME WE WOULD STILL BE PAYING THE LEASE. ADDITIONALLY AFTER WE TAKE OVER OWNERSHIP OF OF THE PROPERTY THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR MAINTENANCE AND UTILITIES THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO FACTOR IN THAT WOULD OFFSET ANY REDUCTION I'M. SO THEN THE ONLY PART THAT I THINK THAN WOULD BE CONFUSING IS WE'RE REALLY BEING ASKED TO WOULDN'T BE EXPENDED UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE SALLY WE CAN BUILD A PART IN A FINANCED SO -- WE WOULD. EXERCISE THE THE PURCHASE OPTION -- SOMETIME BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE. RESOLVED BEFORE THAT ACQUISITION ACTUALLY AKE PLACE. AND THAT IS -- WE WOULD -- TASK THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES WITH WITH DOING THEIR THEIR BASIC REAL ESTATE DUE DILIGENCE THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY DO THAT WE HAVE TO GET APPRAISALS -- THERE HAS TO BE A SEQUEL -- ACT SIX ACTIVITIES UP. PHASE ONE ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS POSSIBLY FEES TO DEPENDING ON WHAT'S DISCOVERED IN PHASE ONE SO THERE ARE NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE TO OCCUR. BUT WE WOULD -- ENCUMBER THE MONEY THAT THE FUNDS AND AND HOLD THEM IN OUR FROM TOLD THE TIME THAT THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE DONE AND THEN WE CAN EXERCISE THE OPTION [inaudible] I'M. I THINK WE'D WANT TO JUST. MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER. WE APPROPRIATED FOR THE CAPITAL OUTLAY DID. WAS SUGGESTED BY WHATEVER -- REDUCTION IN COSTS DUE TO NO LONGER HAVING AT LEAST JUST SO THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY. AN APPROVING THE THE CAPITAL OUTLAY AMOUNT -- MENTOR IF I COULD ADD TO THAT PLEASE -- SO THE AMOUNT THAT'S BEEN QUESTED HERE'S TWO POINT TWO MILLION AND THAT'S THE EXACT AMOUNT THAT'S NEEDED. FOR THE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION AND TO HAVE THESE YES ENGAGE IN THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT THAT ARE REQUIRED -- ANY REDUCTION TO THAT AMOUNT WOULD. THERE WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH. IN FUNDING. TO PROCEED WITH THE ACQUISITION SO OF THE NORMAL PROCESS THAT WE WOULD ENVISION IS THAT AFTER THE ACQUISITION TAKES. PLACE THEN BE BASED BUDGET OF THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE REDUCED ACCORDINGLY BY THE THE SAVINGS IN THE RENT. I THINK I CAPTURED THE RIGHT ANY OTHER. YES SENATOR BELT -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU BY BUILDING IT LOOK AT IT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO RE HAVE BETTER FIX IT UP. IS THAT INCLUDING THE CLUSTER. I'M MORE FORTUNATE THAT. THE ANSWER IS YES AND THEN AND THE WERE FORTUNATE THAT WE'VE -- WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE BUILDING NOW SO WHEN WE THE WENT TO LEASE THIS BUILDING WE DID HAVE TO DO SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT. WERE INITIALLY STRUCTURES PART AN AMORTIZATION THE EXPECTED COME TO US AND ASK FOR MONEY TO REHABILITATE THE BUILDING OR HOW OLD IS THIS BILL. I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT -- DATA THE BILLING BUT I KNOW IT CAN TELL YOU THAT WE DID SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BUILDING BEFORE WE HAD OCCUPIED RECENTLY SO. TO IT'S NINETEEN NINETY SIX NINE SIX THANKS SALLY. ALERT ME. SO SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE ARE YOU KNOW LIKE NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU COME AROUND TO THE BUDGET TIME ARE YOU GOING TO SAY WELL WE NEED A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS. EXCEPT UPPER WHAT MOUNTAINS STORY THERE THERE'S NO ANTICIPATION OF HAVING TO COME TO A FOR THAT CAN I CAN I CAN'T SAY THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE AND A LOT OF THAT WILL BE VOTED OUT THROUGH THE DUE DILIGENCE. PROCESS A LOOKING AT THE BUILDING AND TO VALIDATE THE OF THE ASSOCIATED -- PRICES SO CITY WITH. IT'S KIND OF NICE AND THOUGH. WITH THE LOOMING IF WE HAVE THE PURCHASE OF A YES SIR THAT'S PART OF WHAT APARTMENT I'M EXCUSE ME DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES WILL LOOK AT THE OLD DO I INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY AND THEY'LL ASSESS THE BILL THE CONDITION OF THE BUILDING BUT WE'RE TOLD THAT THE BUILDING IS IN VERY. GOOD CONDITION. SO WE DON'T ANTICIPATE ANYTHING FURTHER. I LET ME SEE IF THEIR CENTER MORE LOOK AHEAD -- NO REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION IS A FUN. YES AGAIN ASKING BASIC QUESTIONS. DOES THE G. S. HAVE A THE MAJORITY OF THE ALREADY OWNED PROPERTIES THAT YOU COULD. UTILIZE OR EMAIL BACKGROUND ON HOW YOU FOUND THIS PROPERTY IN. OUT OFFICE IN. SHIRT SO -- WE HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED A LIST OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR US TO USE AND WHEN WE WENT THROUGH OUR WHEN WE WENT TO GET THIS LEASE FOR THIS PROPERTY THAT WE HAD. WE WORK THROUGH DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES ORIGINALLY TO GET THE SPACE WERE CURRENTLY OCCUPYING RIGHT NOW SO. THEY ASSIST US THEY DO A OF THE SEARCH FORCE THEY ALSO -- CONDUCT -- THAT PART OF THEIR DILIGENCE TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO US -- THEY ASSISTED US WE LOOKED AT MULTIPLE SITES. AND WE WHITTLE IT DOWN TO THIS PARTICULAR SITE -- AND THEN WENT IN AND HAD TO DO SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SITE AND AND MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS -- READY FOR US TO PUT THESE. ON HIGH DOLLAR ENGINES -- THAT ARE THERE ARE SOME EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT SO WE WENT THROUGH -- MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE SECURE SECURITY MEASURES WERE PUT IN THE ROOF AND AND OTHER -- ITEMS WERE -- IS SATISFACTORY FOR US -- TO OCCUPY INTAKE -- A USE OF THE SPACE WAS THERE SO THAT'S THAT WAS PART OF ALL OF HAT DUE DILIGENCE. EARLY ON TO FIND AN ACCEPTABLE PLACE FOR US TO ESTABLISH THE SHOP AND WAREHOUSE THAT WE CURRENTLY USE THERE AND SO. FORTH. YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO PURCHASE. AND SO RIGHT NOW REAL ESTATE IS DOING PRETTY WELL. AND WE'RE FORTUNATELY -- ESTABLISH THE THE LEASES TIME WE PUT IN A LEASED BY OR PURCHASE OPTION INTO THIS -- IT'S FIXED FORCE RIGHT NOW IT TWO MILLION ---IF WE GO BEYOND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE MARK THEN IT ASSERTS A 3% ESCALATION. OF FOR THAT COSTS -- OUR TIME NOW. IF WE MAKE THIS DECISION NOW OBVIOUSLY WILL SAVE MORE MONEY AND THE LESS MONEY THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO RENT AS WE GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS THE ANYTIME WE EXERCISE IT. THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT BECOMES BETTER FORCE EARLIER -- THERE'S ALSO SIGNS IN THE MARKET PLACE RIGHT NOW THAT WE MAY BE HEADING TOWARDS A RECESSION. WHICH COULD MEAN THAT. MIGHT BE TOO I HAVE A PURCHASE PRICE WHAT KIND OF STOP GAP DO YOU HAVE -- HOW DO YOU PUT THE BRAKES ON TO SAY YOU KNOW MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT THING JUST TGS? GET ANOTHER APPRAISAL EVERY SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR. OURS IS THE IS THE PRICE MAY BE CONSIDERED THE MINIMUS TWO TWO MILLION IS. I WANTED I DON'T MINIMIZE ANY AMOUNT BUT IT IS SORT OF THE BUDGET DOES KIND OF IT. YOU KNOW AGREED AND AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS GOES BACK TO THE THE SAME DUE DILIGENCE THAT -- COMES LOOKING BILL ALREADY SPOKE TO AND THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK AND DO THAT THAT PROCESS. UNDER THE FORMAL PROCESS TO DO THAT -- AS PART OF THAT SEARCHES FOR THAT EVALUATION AND IT GOES THROUGH THE A PUBLIC WORKS SPORT AS PART OF OUR OUR NORMAL ACQUISITION PROCESS AND THAT WILL. OF THAT OUT ANY ISSUES THAT WE SEE -- DISCREPANCIES AND MAY FORCE US TO GO BACK AND SAY WE NEED TO RE NEGOTIATE THE PRICE AT THAT POINT TIME BUT ALL RIGHT NOW WERE WERE FORTUNATE WITH THE MARKET HOT THAT WE'VE BUILT IN THAT -- OF FIXED PRICE POINT RIGHT NOW FOR FOR PURCHASE TO BUY. SO AS A AS A LEGISLATOR IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT TO BEING LIKE -- SIR BALLOT OR SUPERVISORS SO WE WE HAD DEPARTMENT HAS SINCE I'M. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS YOU KNOW EVEN AFTER BEING HERE FOR A FEW YEARS HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RUN AND WHETHER MANAGE PROPERLY AND EFFECTIVELY. I DON'T GET TOO MANY CHANCES TO THAT SIDE I KNOW I MET WITH -- MISTER I I LOVE HIS LAST NAME. GILARDI G.. RECORD GUILTY YES SIR YEAH SO -- HE STRIKES ME AS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT BUT SOME OF THE BILLS I'VE SEEN SOME OF THE ISSUES I'VE SEEN YOU KNOW ARTICLES I'VE READ LIKE. I KIND OF WONDER HOW DO YOU MANAGE YOU KNOW. TO ANALYZE OR CRITIQUE OR HELP OR YOU KNOW A DEPARTMENT SO HOW IS -- ES DOING AS A DEPARTMENT. IF I COULD ASK YOU IT. BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE I DON'T HAVE MARK HERE. I'M PROBABLY A LITTLE BIASED I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT I THINK WE'RE DOING VERY WELL -- I THINK -- THE EVENTS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS -- THE NUMBER OF PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATIONS THE SCOPE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE DISASTER THAT WE FACED. AND THE RESPONSE THAT -- CALLOW S. IS ENGAGED IN AND AND HOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH OUR FEDERAL AND COUNTY AND CITY PARTNERS -- SPEAKS WELL TO WHAT WE'VE DONE -- BUT ONCE AGAIN IT HI I'M PROBABLY BIASED BECAUSE I'M INTERNAL THAT AYE AYE THE FEEDBACK THAT I RECEIVE AND THAT I THINK ALL MY FELLOW EXECUTIVES RECEIVE FROM -- EVERYONE THAT WE WORK WITH HAS BEEN HAS BEEN POSITIVE IN THIS LAST -- THREE YEARS. THE LAST YEAR IN BUDGET WE HAD A REQUEST FROM O. E. S.. ANY GET BEAT UP I MEAN WAS CRITICIZED THAT IT WAS NOT A PRETTY LITTLE EXERCISE SO WHAT. WILL THE CAN WE DO TO HELP YOU. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE -- WE CAN -- YOUR SUPPORT ON THE ACQUISITION FIRE SHOP WHERE ELSE TO ENSURE THAT THESE ENGINES ARE MAINTAINED IN USED. FOR FIREFIGHTING OPERATIONS AT THE COMMODITIES -- PROPERLY -- STAGE -- BEYOND THAT -- THERE'S A SERIES OF PROPOSALS THAT CALLAWAY'S HAS AND WE WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT CENTER. THANKS FOR LET ME HAS SOME DIFFERENT QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR I JUST. THIRTY NINE WITH IT BEING A LEGISLATORS ALL AT DIFFERENT TO BE AN EXECUTIVE. SUPERVISORS AUTUMN. I'M TRYING TO GROW INTO THE ROLE THANKS. YOU'RE WELCOME AND WE ARE AS MEMBERS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE WE ARE CHARGED WITH THAT THE REASON WE HAVE HEARINGS IS FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE BUDGET SO. CERTAINLY -- PRECIADO OFFICE. COMING. BETTER AT IT SO DO MANY QUESTIONS RIGHT BEFORE I ENTERTAIN A MOTION IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. OKAY SO THE MOTION I WOULD ENTERTAIN IS THAT WE WOULD A PROOF AS BUDGETED -- WITH THE REDUCTION COMMENSURATE TO REFLECT. THAT THE FACILITY WOULD BE OWNED -- THAT AT THE POINT THAT THE SALE WAS CONCLUDED. SO WITH THAT IS THERE A MOTION. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION LET'S DO ROLL CALL CENTER SKINNER HI AND MORLOCK [inaudible] CENTRE BELL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] YEAH. THANKS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU A CENTER RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO TO ISSUE SIX THE INTER. OPERABLE PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO SYSTEM. SAME FOLKS GO AHEAD. THOUGH THIS REQUEST IS FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND IN EIGHT POSITIONS AND NINETEEN TWENTY TO START A FIVE YEAR PROJECT. THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND. AND IT WOULD ALLOW THIS STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONDER IS TO SEAMLESSLY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER ACROSS MOST OF THE STATE. I KNOW SOMETIMES WE GET INTO A TECHNICAL TECHNICAL -- AREAS THAT SAW -- I DON'T WANT TO GET ANYTHING THAT WILL GO -- OUTSIDE OF OUR AREA THAT. IT TOO COMPLEX BUT WE SEE THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO TO CONNECT THESE THIRTY EIGHT DESPAIR -- STATE NETWORKS THAT ARE LOCATED LIKE LILLY PADS UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- AND IF WE BRING THIS PROPOSAL TOGETHER WILL BE ABLE TO CONNECT THESE NETWORKS TOGETHER AND THEREFORE. ALLOW A FIRST RESPONDER TO SEAMLESSLY MOVE FOR PRIMARY LOCATION LOCATION. AND A CONTINUE COMMUNICATE EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE. AND THEN. LONG TERM -- ONCE THIS IS BEEN BUILT OUT -- THERE'S SAID A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO INTERFACE WITH LOCALS BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF LOCAL NETWORKS AS WELL -- ORANGE COUNTY HAS ONE FOR EXAMPLE IN. THAT IS THE SAN DIEGO ONE AND MANY OTHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE SO THAT WILL LA. AND WILL LOOK TO CONNECT TO THOSE AND SO -- ULTIMATELY -- WHEN YOU MOVE UP AND DOWN THE STATE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE SEAMLESSLY ON A NETWORK SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU DO ON EIGHTEEN T. RIGHT NOW WITH THE? SUBSCRIBER AND OR OR VERIZON OR ANY OTHER NETWORK THAT YOU MOVE ON YOU JUST TRANSITIONING BETWEEN SITE TO SITE AS OPPOSED -- TO LITTLE ISLANDS AND MOST OF US ARE HERE REMEMBER THE EARLY DAYS OF CELL AND THAT'S EXACTLY WE USED TO DO WHEN WE WOULD BOUNCE AROUND. AND A DROP OFF AND COME BACK WE HAD CONNECTIVITY. QUESTION I HAVE IS WHAT DO WE EXPECT THAT THROUGH THIS OF FIVE THIS IS A FIVE YEAR ALLOCATION THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE. INTEROPERABLE SERVICES SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I ASK BECAUSE I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL. DURING THE OAKLAND BERKELEY TUNNEL FIRE. AND ONE OF THE WHILE IT MOVED VERY FAST AND WOULD HAVE HAD REALLY DAMAGING CONSEQUENCES REGARDLESS. WHEN WE INVOKED MUTUAL AID? WE FOUND AND ALSO THE BERKELEY OAKLAND TOTAL FIRE DID. REALLY HIT THREE JURISDICTIONS BOTH THE CITY'S A BERKELEY CITIES OAKLAND AND SOME UNINCORPORATED COUNTY AREA AND THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT? OUR AGENCIES COULD NOT COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. AND SOLVE OUR EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL WERE BEING SPIED THE COULD NOT COMMUNICATE. AND THE THERE WERE OTHER YEP THERE WERE LOTS OF RACERS PROBLEMS AND IT IN FACT WE DID NOT GET. FULLY INTEROPERABLE SERVICE. THERE WAS. EIGHTY NINE WE DO NOT FINALLY CHEAP IT UNTIL. MID TO REWRITE BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SO THAT WAS A LONG TIME COMING AND THERE WEREN'T EVEN THAT MANY AGENCIES BUT ANYWAY SO IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT [inaudible] I'M. I WOULD COMMENT THAT I THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT -- THE CHALLENGES FOR COMMUNICATIONS COME UP -- AND ALMOST EVERY MAJOR DISASTER AND LOCATION IT'S THEIR THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE CHALLENGES BEYOND THIS WE'VE SECOND TREMENDOUS STEPS -- FOR FAMILIARITY WITH THE THE COMMITTEE I NOW WITH FIRE SCOPE -- THE FIRE COMMUNITY DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB ACTUALLY PRESET FREQUENCIES -- WHERE -- EVERYBODY LOAD SIMILAR AND THERE'S THERE'S DESIGN FREQUENCIES FOR INTER OPERABLE A MUTUAL AID RESPONSE OF FOR THEM SO. TWO ONE AGE. ENGINES -- COME IN AND AS YOU PROBABLY SAW -- WITH THE FIRES WE HAD SANTA ROSA WERE WE HAD -- ALL OF THE FEDERAL ASSETS WITH MUTUAL AID COMING IN FROM ALL OVER THE WESTERN UNITED STATES AND AND AS FAR AWAY AS OVERSEAS -- THE INTEROPERABLE CONSTANT WAS NOT AN ISSUE. OF FOR YOU THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT SURFACED IN THAT PARTICULAR -- FIRE PIECE TO IT. WHAT CHANGES IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR YOU IS? IF YOU WERE IF YOU'RE IN ONE AREA FOR EXAMPLE -- FEWER CDC ARE IN YOUR TO PRISON THERE'S A NICE NETWORK RIGHT THERE THAT PRISON. SOON AS YOU LEAVE THAT PRISON AREA AND STRUGGLING A PRISONER TRANSPORT OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE DOING -- YOU DROP OFF AND THEN WHEN YOU GET YOUR NEXT NETWORK YOU'RE BACK ON IF YOU CONNECT THESE NETWORKS THROUGH INTERFACES AND PATHWAYS AND USE OUR BACKBONE THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE STATE. YOU CAN NOW SEAMLESSLY TRAVEL UP AND DOWN AND THEN THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE MONEY THAT WE SPENT ON THE FEDERAL SIDE. EARLY ON TO BUILD THE LOCAL NETWORK CITY SABIR X. LA RICK'S -- SAN DIEGO -- THIS THE VALLEY THERE'S THERE'S A THE LILY PADS THAT EXIST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. THERE'S A LONG TERM STRATEGICALLY YOU'RE ABLE TO THEN START MIGRATING CONNECTING EVERYBODY TOGETHER. AND THEN YOU JUST START SUBSCRIBING AND IT'S A VERY. SEAMLESS INTERFACE AT THAT POINT ONCE YOU'VE BUILT -- THAT THAT -- TECHNOLOGICAL CONNECTION. YOU'RE YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT. REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT WE BE -- JEEP THIS IN THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD WE ARE AND WERE FOR YES I AM A CHAIRMAN AND AND WE HAVE OTHER STATES THAT WE'VE USED TO MODEL FROM AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE RE FEEL COMFORTABLE SAYING THAT TINA. I KNOW THAT THE LA -- HAD A ROUND RAISE THE POINT THAT THIS THE ACTION IS BOTH. THE ARM. APPROVAL OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS FIVE YEAR PROGRAM BUT THEN ALSO AN ON GOING. APPROVAL FOR THE WORK LOAD FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND I THINK THERE -- THE LA -- WANTED TO RAISE THE POINT THAT PERHAPS WE WON'T KNOW HE YET IN FIVE YEARS WHAT THAT. WORKLOAD MIGHT BE SO. ESSENTIALLY -- THERE MIGHT BE SOME EFFICIENCIES ASSOCIATEDWITH ONCE THIS -- SYSTEM IS FINALLY INTEGRATED AND YOU DON'T HAVE THIRTY DESPERATE SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN. THIRTY EIGHT I'M EXCUSE ME BUT ALSO JUST BECAUSE THAT LEVEL OF WORKLOAD TO BUILD THE SIZE SYSTEM MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. FROM THE LEVEL REQUIRED TO OPERATE IT SO THAT WAS A RECOMMENDATION. FIND IT ACROSS A LOT MORE BUT THAT NOT MEANING THIS WORKLOAD DEPENDING ON WHATEVER I'M ANYWAY BUT CENTER MORE LIKE AND THEN I'M GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT AN HONOR IN A MOTION GO AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MISTER SMITH BIGGER WHICH A MEDIC OF EDGE BUT YES SIR I HAD A BIGGER VISION OKAY THANK YOU MITCH -- HOW DOES THIS RELATE? TO THE FIRE DRILL WE DID LAST. INTERCESSIONS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE PHONE. TAXPAYERS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. PROJECT. ABSOLUTELY A DIFFERENT THIS IS SO SOLELY FOR A RADIO THIS IS TAKING THE RADIO IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR FIRST RESPONDERS CHP HELLFIRE. FISHING GAME OF FISH WILDLIFE ANYBODY. SEE CORRECTIONS ANYBODY WHO HAS A RADIO IT'S EITHER IN THE CAR OR MOTORCYCLE AIRCRAFT FOR VEHICLE WERE ON THEIR PERSON. THIS IS CONNECTING TO A NOT A MICROWAVE NETWORK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GEORGE COUNTY WHICH HAS THE EIGHT HUNDRED MEGAHERTZ AND I'VE BEEN ALL WITH THAT. FOR SOME TIME SO I CAN I JUST WANTED TO MAKE MAKE SURE THAT I WASN'T STEPPING INTO. IN SODIUM OR YOU COUNTY IS A VERY GOOD ONE AS YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW A VERY GOOD ONE IT'S NICE. IT WORKS REALLY WELL FURTHER FURTHER AREA -- AT IF YOU'RE TRANSITIONING OUT THEN OF COURSE YOU COME OFF THAT NETWORK. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR WORK [inaudible] ON FINALLY [inaudible] THE MOTION. CENTER SKINNER ART CENTER MORLOCK [inaudible] CENTRE BELL [inaudible] ALRIGHT. THANK CHAIRMAN THANK CENTERS. THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL PLAN ON GOING TO PRE POSITIONING ACTIVITIES. THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF ONE TIME LEGISLATIVE UP OF APPROPRIATIONS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED. AND EVERY YEARS. AND OF ITS TO SUPPORT PRE POSITION ACTIVITIES FOR ALL HAZARD EVENT. I HAD CHIEF MARSHAL HERE WHO CAN. PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS.

TO PROVIDE THAT INSURANCE WERE WE HAVE FIRE APPARATUS WE HAVE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS HELICOPTERS WHATEVER RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. SO WE CAN ATTACK -- AN EMERGENCY FAST AND MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE. AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS TO OUR PUBLIC. AMADOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFICATION BASED ON THE STAFF CAUGHT RECOMMENDATION ABOUT THE FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVED -- IN THE BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY RECEIVED AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND -- IT HAS TAKEN A LITTLE BIT OF TIME -- FOR YES TO SPEND THAT DOWN I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE STRICTER REQUIREMENTS WHEN USING G. G. R. F.. IT WAS LIMITED I BELIEVED ONLY FIRE HAZARDS NOT ALL HAZARDS -- SO IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING BUT THEY ARE WORKING THROUGH IT AND STARTING TO SPEND IT DOWN -- IN THE BUDGET ACT OF THIS YEAR THERE IS A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED A GENERAL FUND AND FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OR SO IT WAS -- USED TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS -- BUT THEN SB NINE OH ONE WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST CHANGE THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW THEM TO USE IT FOR PRE POSITIONING FOR ALL HAZARDS. SO YES REALLY ONLY HAS SIX MONTHS REALLY TO SPEND THAT MONEY ON PRE POSITIONING -- AND WE THINK THAT THESE THESE RESOURCES ARE CRUCIAL THEY DO HELP WITH RESPONDING TO ALL TYPES OF HAZARDS OF FOR PRE POSITIONING OUR RESOURCES AND SO WE DO THINK THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION. AND CONTINUING UP INVESTMENT IN THAT -- IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WELL THE COMMENT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT -- AGAIN JUST THIS IS IN GENERAL FUND THIS IS THE BUT HAS LOTS OF COMPETITION AND WHILE I THINK THERE'S CLEARLY SOME CLEAR NEEDS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE THEM AN INCREASE. IT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO IT WHERE YOU MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO MODIFY IT BECAUSE JUST THE IF YOU KNOW DEPARTMENTS ABILITY. TO TO SPEND THE FINES. WITHIN TIME PERIOD SO I THINK WHAT WE'D WANT TO DO AND ALL ON THE LA -- NEXT BUT WHAT WE'D WANT TO DO IS HOLD THIS OPEN AND SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER ASSESSMENT. OF WHAT THE NEED IS CLOSER TO THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND A B. C. P. ASSOCIATED WITH IT. SINCE WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW [inaudible] I'M -- A DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT. THAT'S EXACTLY IN LINE WITH OUR COMMENTS AND WE DID KNOW BOTH FOR THIS ITEM IN THE NEXT ITEM THAT -- WILL BE HEARD I BELIEVE THAT THERE WEREN'T BC PIECES THERE WASN'T THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD TYPICALLY RECEIVE ON A PROPOSAL -- AND ONE SPECIFIC TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS IS A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE ON GOING NEED CERTAINLY PRE POSITIONING -- SEEMS LIKE HAS A LOT OF VALUE IN CAN MAKE A LOT OF SENSE I'M AS WAS MENTIONED BY IDEA LAUGH -- THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN -- A LITTLE BIT SLOWER GETTING THIS OUT NO COURSE THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM SO SOME OF THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED -- IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THEY SPEND APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO FAR ONE POINT FIVE SO IT'S JUST UNCERTAIN WHETHER TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS RIGHT ABOUT MAYBE IT SHOULD BE MORE MAYBE SHOULD BE LESS -- SO IT SEEMS LIKE A PRUDENT APPROACH -- TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME FOR FOR A MORE THOROUGH ASSESSMENT. MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY REALLY QUICK I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR THAT THE THE MONEY THAT'S PROPOSE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS A GENERAL FUND ONGOING COMMITMENT NOT. YEAH IT IS ONGOING AND I THINK JUST TOUCH ON THE BCP QUESTION I THINK THE REASON WE DIDN'T PREPARE ONE FOR THE SPECIFICALLY AND THE NEXT ONE THAT -- MISS CHRISTINE MENTION IS BECAUSE THESE WERE ALLEGED COMMITMENTS FROM LAST YEAR AND THAT WE'RE JUST COMMITTING ON GOING FUNDING FOR THESE PURPOSES. AND SO -- I THINK THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T DO IT BUT YEAH THIS IS A GENERAL FUND. PROPOSAL FOR THE BUDGET. THAT CLARIFICATION BY THINK WE pA B. C. P. ON IT JUST BECAUSE WHILE I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO UNDERMINE THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION. IF WE KNOW THAT WE WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO SPEND. BOBBY -- I'M FROM PEOPLE COMPLETELY GRABBING OUT OF THE YEAR NUMBER RIGHT NOW TEN MILLION IN THAT NEXT FISCAL YEAR THEN WE'D WANT TO ONLY APPROPRIATE THAT AMOUNT. SO ANY QUESTION OR COMMENT CENTER MORE LACKEY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- CHIEF MARSHALLED BUT YOU'VE GOT A BIG STATE AND IT'S LIKE -- FOR ME IT'S LIKE UP WITH A FOUR GAME OR WITH A WAR GAME ACTUALLY WHERE YOU HAVE ALL YOUR RESOURCES AROUND STATE. AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS. HOW? HOUSE BEEN WORKING SO FAR -- IN ANTICIPATING -- ZERO HUMIDITY. UP YOU KNOW DAY IN AND AND HOW DID IT WORK LET'S SAY FOR SOME OF THE RECENT. FIRES AND WHAT ARE WE LEARNING AND WHAT CAN WE IMPROVE ON WELL I CAN TELL YOU AGAIN IT'S A IT'S AN INSURANCE POLICY IT'S WORKING GOOD WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM -- WERE USING IT FOR ALL HAZARDS NOT JUST THE WILDLAND FIRE BUT THE FLOODS AND WE SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR MASSIVE FLOODING IN THE BURN SCARS A LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO WHEN THE PROCESS IS PUT INTO PLACE I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS STORIES. BECAUSE A ITS SURGE CAPACITY IN A COMMUNITY AND BASED ON THE WEATHER WERE ABLE TO THROW EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK. TO AN EMERGENCY AND THE SUCCESS RATE IS A LOT BETTER THAN HAVING TO CALL FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND THEY RESPOND -- BUT FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE ABLE TO GET THESE RESOURCES WERE PREDICTED WHETHER BASED ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. THOSE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. WE HAVE A RECENT SUCCESS STORY -- A RECENT SUCCESS STORY. SANTA BARBARA COUNTY -- THEY HAD PRE POSITION RESOURCES FOR A FLOOD EVENT. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO GO OUT AND MAKE RESCUES. AND EVEN MORE SO THEY WERE ABLE TO HAVE. PEOPLE THAT WERE MANAGING THE INCIDENT THE RESOURCES STAGE AND THEY WEREN'T IMPACTING THEIR DAY TO DAY ROUTINE ACT. ACTIVITIES THAT THEIR FIRE DEPARTMENTS TASK WITH. SO THEY WERE ABLE TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO AN INCIDENT AND CONTINUE THEIR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS SO -- THE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENTS CONTACTED US AND TOLD US THANK YOU GOOD JOB. THANK YOU CHIEF MARSHALL THANK YOU MISTER BURTON WE DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS SIDE OF MADAM CHAIR AT THANK YOU FOR THAT -- JEFF MASTON REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. WE WORK VERY -- WEBER COLLABORATIVE OF THE WITH EVERYONE TRYING TO PUT THIS CONCEPT TOGETHER AND JUST WANT TO BRING A FEW THINGS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. ONE IS -- WHEN YOU PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES THEY BECOME A STATE ASSET? AND THAT'S VERY VALUABLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN THERE ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED OUR PURPOSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE PROECTIVE SERVICES WE UNDERSTAND THAT EVENTS WILL HAPPEN OR THEY'RE LIKELY TO OCCUR WE CAN PUT THEM WHERE THEY BELONG AND THERE ISN'T THAT THE LATE BECAUSE SECONDS COUNT? ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE PRE POSITIONING MONEY WILL BE TO ADD SOME TECHNOLOGY TO THE SYSTEM -- NOW ALL OUR FIRE APPARATUS SOME DO AND SOME DON'T. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. IT ISN'T LIKE UBER WHERE WE CAN SEE AN APP AND FIGURE OUT WHERE APPARATUSES SO -- SOMETIMES THE CLOSEST APPARATUS TO THE INCIDENT DON'T GET DISPATCHED OR ART ASSIGNED TO THE INCIDENT BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE SO THAT'LL BE REALLY IMPORTANT THING. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW CALIFORNIA'S -- MUTUALLY SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE FINEST IN THE COUNTRY IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN FIFTY AND AFTER LAST COUPLE SIGNIFICANT YEARS OF FIRE. A WE COLLECTIVELY THROUGH FIRE SCOPE AND OTHER BODIES THAT DOWN SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING BETTER WE'RE NOT SERVICING THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA APPROPRIATELY ONE OF THE EASIEST QUICKEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS WE'VE DONE IS. ESTABLISH PRE POSITIONING SO THE THE BEAUTY OF IT IS AS YOU USE IT WHEN YOU NEED IT WHEN YOU DON'T NEED IT YOU DON'T USE IT YOU DON'T PAY FOR IT. SO WE'RE REALLY POSITIVE ABOUT IT -- I REPRESENT NOT ONLY THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS BUT IN THIS CASE FAR DISTRICTS IS ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA METROPOLITAN FIRE CHIEFS. THE LEAGUE OF CITIES FIRE CHIEFS -- AND WE COLLECTIVELY WORK WITH A WE HAS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THE PROGRAM L. ONLY REFINE ITSELF. AND THE CITIZENS OUR STATE WILL GET WHAT THEY REALLY DESERVE AND THAT'S SUPERIOR FIRE PROTECTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. REALLY PRE J. YOUR BEING HERE AND SHARING THAT -- REALLY APPRECIATE IT. RIGHT SEEING NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS. I'M WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS OPEN. AND SIR SURE SURE SENATOR BREAUX JUST THE FROM THE LOOK THE LOOK INTO FOR ME. OF WE HAD AN INCIDENT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WHERE THEIR RADIO. AND THEIR PHONE THEY WERE TRYING TO CALL EACH OTHER ON THE PHONE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT IS BEING DONE IN THE MUTUAL AID PROGRAMS. TO NOT LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN WHERE THEY WORK THE PHONE COMPANY CANCEL THEIR PHONE AGREEMENT. DURING THE FIRE WHILE THEY WERE TRYING TO CALL CONTACT EACH OTHER. A FEW MEMBER THAT'S PRETTY IT WAS PRETTY. THEY WERE TRYING TO CALL. ON THE PHONE FOR MORE QUICK MEANT FROM SOMEBODY AND THEN.

ISSUE TEN CENTS A SENATOR RICARDO IS HERE [inaudible] AND THIS IS ON REQUEST FOR FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY WATER. TANKS WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THE ITEM OPEN -- BUT WE'LL HEAR IT RIGHT. THERE ARE YOU HAVE FULLER. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDED TO OUR OFFICE ON DROUGHT RELIEF PROGRAMS IN THE CURRENT WORK TO PROVIDE. ASSISTANCE TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND SENATE DISTRICT. FOURTEEN I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT OVERSIGHT ITEM THAT IS DEEPLY IMPORTANT TO MY DISTRICT. IN CALIFORNIA OVER TWELVE HUNDRED FAMILIES HAVE NEEDED EMERGENCY WATER TANKS AS A RESULT OF HONEST HIS HISTORIC DROUGHT. ALTHOUGH THE DROUGHT WAS THE CLERK OVER IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN WATER SHORTAGE IS A CHRONIC SYMPTOMS IN MY IN MY DISTRICT AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. GROUND WATER MOVES MUCH MORE SLOWLY THAN SURFACE WATER AND IT TAKES TIME FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE OF WELLS TO OCCUR. THIS MEANS THAT MANY FAMILIES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHO RELY ON WELLS FOR THEIR DRINKING WATER ARE STILL IN NEED OF INTERMITTENT. EVEN THOUGH THE DROUGHT HAS BEEN DECLARED OVER. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INSTALL TEMPORARY WATER TANKS IN THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY. HOWEVER ABOUT FORTY FAMILIES IN MY DISTRICT CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM THE AFTERMATH OF THE GEL. OF THE DROUGHT AS FUNDS WERE NOT BEING ALLOCATED TO FAMILIES WHO DIDN'T GO TRY UNDER THE DROUGHT DECLARATION. UNTIL LAST WEEK IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE FORTY FAMILIES WOULD BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR INTERIM WATER TANK AS A PROGRAM WAS IN ALLOCATING FUNDS TO FAMILIES WHOSE. WELLS WENT DRY AFTER ABLE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE END OF THE DROUGHT DECLARATION. I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR DECLARATION ON MARCH TWENTY FIRST WHICH ALLOCATED ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY FUNDS TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. HOWEVER MY ASK OF A SUBCOMMITTEE AND OF THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IS THAT WE EXPEDITE THESE FUNDS FOR THE PURPOSES OF INSTALLATION OF WATER TANKS FOR HOMES THAT STILL HAVE NO WATER. WHETHER THEY'RE WELLS WENT DRY UNDER THE DROUGHT DECLARATION OR NOT. THE FACT F THE MATTER IS THAT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN MY DISTRICT THAT TO THIS DAY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER IN THEIR HOMES. I ASK YOU THAT YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE SURE THESE FORTY FAMILIES IN MY DISTRICT ARE FOR IT SOME SOME. SMALL RELIEF AND HAVE ACCESS TO AND FROM WATER TANKS. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TAMMY BUT MAY WITH SELF HELP ENTERPRISES TO HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU MEMBERS. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK CONSIDERATION OF THIS RISK REQUEST -- WE DID RECEIVE NOTIFICATION ON TUESDAY THAT WE HAVE. THE OFFICE OR OF THE REGION'S THEIR BUSINESS RELEASE THE FUNDS TO US IN ORDER TO PUT TING FOUND ON THE GROUND. I'M WE DO HAVE A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME TO DO THAT. I THINK THAT IN AND NOW I THINK I KNOW IT DOES IN. TWELVE THIRTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY MY NAME'S TAMMY MCVEIGH WITHOUT HELP ENTERPRISE. I AM THE MANAGER OF DROUGHT SERVICES. ADAM SO I OVER I JUST STARTED OVERSEEING THE WE PUT THE TANK PROGRAM IN WITH OUR WELL PROGRAM IT JUST. CLOSE SO WE STARTED OVERSEEING THIS AND WE NOTICED. THERE WERE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH. LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN -- YES AND SELF HELP ENTERPRISES NOT. I GUESS MAYBE NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE NEED WAS THERE WE START PUSHING. ONLY THIRTY MEETING AND I GUESS SHARING THAT DISCUSSION THAT. WE HAVE MANY FAMILIES I THINK THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THERE WERE NOT SO MANY FAMILIES OUT THERE. BUT ACTUALLY WE SIGN INCREASE IN THE NEED ACT. THE DECLARATION WAS LIFTED BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN FAMILIES ARE REALLY BEING AFFECTED. HELLO WE DO HAVE A TIME FRAME TO GET IT. SO YOU DID RECEIVE NOTICE JUST LAST TUESDAY THAT I DID RECEIVE A IT'S AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT NOPE NOT LAST TUESDAY JUST. TWO DAYS -- OKAY YES -- IT'S AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AND WILL HAPPEN UNTIL THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TO SPEND [inaudible] THAT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] I'M. SO IT'S POSSIBLE [inaudible] THAT. WE MAY NOT. NEED TO DO. THE REALLOCATION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT REALLOCATION HOWEVER I'M I DON'T. SEE BASED ON WHAT WE SEE. EVERY SINGLE DAY WE RECEIVE AT LEAST THREE TO FOUR CALLS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE STILL GOING. IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH -- AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST STARTING TO HEAR ABOUT. IF WE CAN TEN YEAH ON THE ACT. I DON'T THINK THAT. THE END I DON'T THINK THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WILL. LAST UNTIL THE END OF TWENTY OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON FIND PARTY CALLED. DO YOU THINK SHE I'M. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SIDE OF OKAY AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER LA OF RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR INFORMING US. AND THE WORD AS I INDICATED WHEN WE OPENED WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT OPEN. BUT I THINK WE UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. MUCH BETTER NOW THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY SO WE'LL NOW RETURN BACK. IN THE ORDER. AND THAT IS ISSUE EIGHTY HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND THIS -- ONE JUST FOR COLLEAGUES KNOW THIS IS A WE WE COULD CALL IT AN ONGOING PROGRAM EXCEPT THAT [inaudible] LAST YEAR -- IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION DURING THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE [inaudible] THAT THE FUNDING FOR THE GRANTS. WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET AND I THINK I WAS ONE OF THOSE WHERE PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE AND I I AM NOW NOT RECALLING WHETHER WE WERE ABLE. TO RESTORE WE DID SO WE TOOK AYE ACTION IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. AND GOT DEFINING IN THERE I THINK WAS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE TO REALIZE WAS IN ALREADY IN THE BUDGET. AND THIS ACTION IS JUST TO CONTINUE ABOUT WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING AND HOPEFULLY GET US IN A SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO BE ALERTED AND THREE CAR FOR ME THAT SOMEHOW IT WAS INCLUDED. SO GO AHEAD. AT THE SOUTH CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AGAIN AS YOU MENTIONED THIS IS JUST A TEN MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL. TO PROVIDE ONGOING SUPPORT FOR THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROGRAM. IT'S BEEN. IT'S BEEN. WE'VE BEEN FUNDED SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BY LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS ACCEPT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHERE THE APPROPRIATE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IT SUPPORTS TWENTY ONE PROJECTS STATE WIDE. AND FOR THE USE OF THE FUNDS TO DATE ONLY THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FUNDS HAVE BEEN CLOSED OUT AN OF THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WERE AWARDED. LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WERE WERE REVERTED. HE SAID HOW MUCH LESS THAN WHAT SAY THAT AGAIN LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WERE REVERTED. IN TEN MILLION IN THIS SO FAR THIS FISCAL YEAR BUT NOW FOR THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ALLOCATION WE GOT THAT'S THE ONLY YEAR WHERE THE FUNDS -- WHERE WE DOWN RIGHT AND THAT OF COURSE WAS THE FIRST YEAR? RIGHT SO IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT SO FAR IT'S BEEN A CONSISTENT THEME HEARD THROUGH THERE THAT THOSE THINGS THAT WE GIVE THE ONE TIME ONLY FUNDING. TO I EVEN NINE MONTHS INTO THE YEAR OF NOT USE THAT MUCH OF THEIR ONE FAMILY FUNDING I'M. BUT I'M ASSUMING THAT IN THAT. IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MONEY WAS WELL MAYBE IT WAS A RE PROCREATIVE BUT THE FOLLOWING YEAR WE DID GIVE THAT A FIVE MILLION [inaudible] ALLOCATION. I'D WE GOT US ANOTHER TEN MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION THE NEXT YEAR OKAY BUT THEN A FIVE YEAR AND SEVENTEEN OKAY. FIVE MILLION NOT A FIVE YEAR FIVE MILLION RIGHT. WOULD WICH MIGHT OF AND I CANNOT REMEMBER MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED THAT THERE WERE SOME UNUSED FUNDS. AT I'M NOT SURE OKAY OKAY. BUT IT THIS REQUEST IS TO CONTINUE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT WE INITIALLY APPROPRIATE IN AN AGAIN APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR. FOR THIS GRANT PROGRAM OKAY. HERNIA DOESN'T HAVE THE CPT BUT ANYWAY LA -- THAT WAS OUR MAIN COMMON IS IS THIS WAS ANOTHER ONE THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE BC HE WAS A CONTINUATION OF CERTAINLY SOME AUGMENTATIONS LEGISLATURE'S MADE IN PAST YEARS -- ONE POINT THAT WE WOULD MAKE ON ON THIS APPROACH SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES ON THAT MIGHT BE -- ENVISIONED AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM POTENTIALLY COULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDS THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES A. B. C. P. COULD. COULD HELP OUTLINED -- THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES THAT ARE EXPECTED IN FEDERAL FUNDS. OR DO WE THAT THE STATE ACTUALLY JUST RECEIVED RECENTLY ON SPECIFICALLY FOR THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT FUNDS. ARE THE STATE LAST YEAR HAD ABOUT GOT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION A LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION THIS YEAR I'M THE TO THAT -- I SHOULD SAY THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALLOCATION WAS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION SO THERE IS A REALLY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FUNDING ON THE FEDERAL SIDE THAT CAN BE USED FOR DIRECT. SERVICES TO VICTIMS INCLUDING POTENTIALLY SOME SERVICES FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING SO JUST WANT TO BRING THAT TO THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE THINK A COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY. WELL WE COULD ALWAYS IN. THE FINAL. BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. YOU KNOW IT. HAVE SOME DIRECTION ROOM PURSUING NOT REDUCING THE TEN MILLION WITH ALLOCATE BUT PURSUING. FEDERAL IN OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS. YOUR LAST FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BUT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE DURING THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WE HAD. LOTS OF PUBLIC COMMENT. OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT WERE PARTNERING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE PARTNERING WITH CITY OR COUNTY AGENCIES THAT WERE PROVIDING. THAT WERE UTILIZING THE FINDING. FOR SUPPORTING OUR AT PROVIDING SERVICES AND OTHER SUPPORTS FOR A VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING EVEN TO THE POINT OF PROVIDING INTERVENTIONS AND REMOVAL OF THE FOLKS AND THEN HOUSING FOR THEM BECAUSE CLEARLY ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PRIMARY -- WAYS THAT SOME THAT THE PERSON IS BEING TRAFFIC TICKETS. PULLED INTO THAT TRACKING IS BECAUSE OF LACK OF RESOURCES THEMSELVES SO -- WELL I COULDN'T SIT HERE AND GIVE YOU SPECIFIC DATA ABOUT THE DEMAND ON THE SERVICES. AT LEAST IN THE PUBLIC HEARING. IN THE COMMENTS THAT WE HEARD AT THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THIS QUITE SIGNIFICANT SO IT OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE'D WANT TO PURSUE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FIND. FEDERAL ANOTHER FUNDING FOR WERE AVAILABLE. AND I'M HERE JUST ONE THING A PLANNED OUT ON THAT IF WE CAN FUNDING PROGRAMS WITH GENERAL FUND WE CAN'T THEN. TRANSITION OUT TO FEDERAL FUNDS ARE WOULD BE SEEN AS A PLAN TEAMS WE JUST HAVE TO BE CARRIED. OUT HOW WE DO BUT WE CAN TRY IF PURSUE MATCHING FUNDS I WAS NOT LOOKING AT IT AS A REDUCTION NO BUT RATHER HEY WE EXPAND OUR ABILITY THAT'S ALL. ANY CMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE I ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS THE CENTER ABOUT IN MY DISTRICT THIS IS THE A MASSIVE ISSUE [inaudible] AND THIS. SLAVERY EXISTED IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH IN ALL FORMS IN TERMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING JUST JUST. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO OFTEN WORKER TRAFFICKING THIS TERRIBLE AMIDST. MASSIVE IT'S A MASSIVE PROBLEM. WE STARTED TO SEE IT IN RUSSIAN SAY STARTED WE'VE UNCOVERED IT AND HAD OPENED OUR EYES TO THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT JUST THAT TRAFFICKING THERE'S ALSO. AT ILLEGAL OPERATIONS THAT UTILIZE PEOPLE -- IN EFFECT LIKE SLAVE LABOR. I'M PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SIDE OF NICOLE ORTOLAN ON BEHALF OF THE AND BERNARDINO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND PORT UP THE ON GO FUNDING -- SOME OF THE BEST A LIST AND IT'S BEEN UTILIZED THIS CRISIS HOTLINES EMERGENCY SHELTER TEMPORARY HOUSING. EMERGENCY FOOD INCLUDING COUNSELING TRANSPORTATION. IT IT RUNS THE GAMUT AND IT'S DEFINITELY UTILIZED. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT THE CARRERA REPRESENT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALSO VERY SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL AND ALSO MAKING IT A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION. OF BECAUSE THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW YEAR TO YEAR BUT MAKING CONTINUOUS SO THAT THE AGENCIES HAVE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING THIS PROBLEM IS NOT GOING AWAY. ANYTIME SOON WE KNOW IT'S A CONTINUOUS -- DEMAND FOR THE SUPPORT ON THAT THESE AGENCIES NEED SO WE ASK FOR A BETTER THANK YOU. BUT AFTERNOON CUSTOMS ACOSTA CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS TED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STRONG SUPPORT OF MANY PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVING TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS ARE ALSO SERVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. EVER IS. AND YOU KNOW WE WERE THRILLED TO SEE THIS MONEY BACK IN CONFERENCE GLAD TO SEE IT AND AT THE BUDGET FROM THE BEGINNING AND AS AN ONGOING REQUEST THAT CAN PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY AND STABILITY TO THE PROGRAMS THAT RELY ON THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON JOHN FINLEY CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL SALTS SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE ONGOING BUDGET PROPOSAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO I'M WILLING TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO APPROVE AS BUDGETED. RIGHT WE HAVE THAT MOTION WILL TAKE A ROLL CALL UNDERSTANDING HI AND MARLA [inaudible] SENATOR ABOUT. ALRIGHT OUR LAST ITEM IS THE CORRECT OUR LAST ITEM. SENATOR BELT. ACTUAL ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION FUNDING AND YOU'RE FREE TO PRESENT RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE -- THANK YOU MAN SURE AS EVERYBODY'S AND OCEAN I'M JUST GONNA BE VERY BRIEF -- I WORKING ALONGSIDE WITH -- ASSEMBLY WOMAN OF BLANCA RUBIO. TO SECURE A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR AND ONGOING FUNDING FOR DOMESTIC. AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION ALONG WITH THE TEN OTHER LEGISLATORS. OF WE WOULD WHEN WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION. IT'S RIGHT NOW OF FOR THE FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHICH FOCUSES ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ZERO TOWARDS SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION. AND WE INVEST NOTHING AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION. BUT YOU REQUEST A MEN'S AND RENAMES OF FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAM TO INCLUDE SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION. DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE VALIUM AFFECTS THE SURVIVOR INFECTS EVERYONE FAMILIES FRIENDS AND COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW WE'RE THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WE'RE SUPPOSED. TO WORK TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. BUT OF IN WE HAVE THE ALL THE BILLIONS. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE AS YET YET TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE OF AND A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS. WHICH OFTEN OR NOT PROSECUTE THERE'S SELDOM PROSECUTED. OF WE HAVE TO APPROACH IN A IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY. AND THIS IS THIS IS THE WAY IS TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION IT'S GOT TO BE THE THE WAY BECAUSE OFTENTIMES. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT PROSECUTED. JUST HAVE TO REALIZE THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A HIGH. OF HILL WE HAVE TO CLIMB AND HOPEFULLY CAN CLIMB TO GET BETTER PROSECUTION BETTER EVIDENCE BUT BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE WE HAVE TO PROVOKE. PROMOTE THE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. OF WE SHOULD NOT WAIT TILL THE PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED COURSE TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE WE NEED TO START AT THE VERY BEGINNING AND STOP. VIOLENCE BEFORE IT HAPPENS. THE CLUSTER A STATE IN HOLE IN ECONOMIC TERMS -- ONE HUNDRED FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. ARE WE OWE IT TO OUR USE THEIR SURVIVORS. ARE COMMUNITIES TO INVEST IN PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAMS. PROMOTING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AFTER COMMUNITIES. ELIMINATING DISMISSIVE AND DISCRIMINATORY LANGUAGE. IN ADDITION TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND SERVICES PROGRAMS AN ORGANIZATION. THIS REQUEST INCLUDES EDUCATING YOUTH ON HEALTHY SAFE RELATIONSHIP SKILLS. IT PROVOKED OF RIGHTS PATHWAYS TO PROGRAMS IMPROVES OUR SCHOOLS AND SAFETY. OF WHY IS THIS SUCH A BIG BUDGET ITEM WELL IF IF WE COULD DO THE PREVENTION WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY ALL KINDS OF OTHER PLACES. WE'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY AND CHILD SUPPORT AYE AYE AYE AS A COUNTY SUPERVISORS OR MORE LIKE WAS. MISSION IS. THE FAMILY AND IT'S USED TO COERCE PEOPLE INTO. NOT NOT COMPLAINING WHEN. WHEN CHILD SUPPORT ISN'T? AND AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THE WORST STATES IN TERMS OF COLLECTION OF CHILD SUPPORT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY -- IN A HORRIBLE STATE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF COLLECTIONS COMPARED TO OTHER FIFTY STATES. SO I I JUST WANT TO USE THAT EXAMPLE BUT I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER THINGS IN TERMS OF OF THE AFFECTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. WE HAVE OUR OUR SURGEON GENERAL IS TALKING ABOUT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES IN. TERMS FOR MATIC EXPERIENCE THE KIDS HAVE AND WHAT THE IMPACT IS. A IT ACTUALLY DESTROYS THE EDUCATION. IT IMPACTS THE EDUCATION BECAUSE THE CHILDREN CANNOT FOCUS WHEN THEIR FAMILIES OF UNDERGOING -- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT'S A PROVEN FACT ALSO SO SO IN TERMS OF OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE OF HUGE. PROBLEMS WITH THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT IT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON EDUCATION. AND AND IT'S NOT RECOGNIZED. AND I I THINK WE HAVE TO SPUR RECOGNIZING IT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO. THIS IS THE PROPOSAL AND OF I THINK IT WOULD -- HELP WORK OUR STATE -- ALTERNATE -- IN THAT TURNED OVER TO OF THE SPEAKERS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CENTER SKINNER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MY NAME IS KRISTEN I'M STUCK WITH CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- HERE ON THIS BUDGET REQUEST. I THINK IT IS TO BUILD ON WHAT THE SENATOR SAID THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUEST WOULD BE FOR ON GOING FUNDING ADMINISTERED AS COMPETITIVE GRANTS THROUGH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES -- WHICH AS YOU ALL KNOW ON THE COMMITTEE. CURRENTLY ADMINISTERS MUCH OF THE DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE FUNDING -- ABIDE MINISTER IN COMPETITIVE GRANTS OUT TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY IS THE PROGRAM ALLOWS -- COMMUNITY IS TO REALLY GROUND TO THEIR PREVENTION EFFORTS AND WHAT WORKS FOR THEIR DISTRACTED THEIR REGION. WE SEE A GREAT WORK WITH YOUTH AROUND IT USE LEADERSHIP EMPOWER MEN -- WE SEE IT WORK HAPPENING WITH THE COACHES AND ATHLETICS. REALLY YOU KNOW. BUILDING COACHES AS LEADERS TO HELP. WITH THE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND REALLY ESTABLISHING WHAT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND WELL BEING CAN LOOK LIKE. DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE ARE DEEPLY GROUNDED IN A RANGE OF ISSUES THAT ARE IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITY IS AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WHEN WE FOCUS ON PREVENTION NOT ONLY DO WE REDUCE THE COST OF THE SENATOR SPOKE ABOUT. FOR THE COST OF CRISIS SERVICES WHICH IS COMMITTEE HAS LONG SUPPORTED BUT ALSO COSTS OF INCARCERATION PROSECUTION. MEDICAL NEEDS OF SURVIVORS -- BUT WHEN WE CAN PREVENT A MUSTARD VIOLENCE WE ALSO PREVENT MASS SHOOTINGS -- OVER HALF OF MASS SHOOTINGS ORIGINATE IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DISAPPEAR. WHEN WE PREVENT MASTIC BALANCE BE PER VAN -- A WHOLE RANGE OF FIRE ARMS -- DEATHS WE PROVIDES -- YOU KNOW OF WHEN WE ADDRESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION WE ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF SO MANY OF THE OTHER -- PROBLEMS PLAGUING OUR COMMUNITY IS SO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A SMART INVESTMENT THAT PAY IS LONG TERM DIVIDENDS AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE HEARING FROM. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING US TO BE HERE MY NAME IS JOHN FINLEY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO HEAR FROM ONE OF OUR MEMBER PROGRAMS WHO I HAD HOPED TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF YOU ALL THE DAY UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO STEP OUT. BUT I THINK IT'S MORE POWERFUL HEARING FROM THEM THE WORK. SACRAMENTO SOUL RAPE CRISIS CENTER AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER. I FIRST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THE MONEY YOU ALLOCATED LAST YEAR TOWARDS PREVENTION AND EDUCATION ON THE ISSUES OF SEXUAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BECAUSE OF THAT FUNDING AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS AND APPROACHES FOR PREVENTING THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE AND EDUCATE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON THESE ISSUES. HOWEVER EVEN WITHOUT FUNDING WE STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EDUCATORS BE IN ALL THE SCHOOLS AND ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT NEED US. WE'VE HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME DIRECT FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING THE MANY AGENCIES DON'T HAVE SO THIS NEW FUNDING WOULD BE VITAL IN EXPANDING THOSE EFFORTS. BECAUSE OF MY PRESENCE IN THE SCHOOLS I'VE SEEN HOW PREVENTION HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON CHANGING ATTITUDES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO SEXUAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WITH THE LAST SIX MONTHS ON ONE OF THE CAMPUSES I'VE SEEN STUDENTS WHO STARTED OUR PROGRAM WITH LITTLE TO NO KNOWLEDGE OF DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND THEY WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF THESE THINGS. NOT ONLY IN THEIR OWN LIVES BUT ALSO AND BROADER SOCIETY. THIS WE'RE GOES BEYOND JUST CLASSROOMS WE HAVE CLUBS AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE THIS KIND OF EDUCATION IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. OUR CAPACITY TO DO PREVENTION WORK WOULD BE EXPANDED WITH INCREASED FUNDING ALLOW FOR MORE EDUCATORS TO BE IN MORE SCHOOLS AND MORE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. OUR COMMUNITY IS NO THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS EDUCATION NOT IT'S HELP IN PREVENTING THESE ISSUES AND CONTINUING WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME AND RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO GO ALL THE PLACES WE ARE ASKED AND WHERE WE ARE NEEDED. I UNDERSTAND YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE AND APPRECIATE YOU ALL AGAIN FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DISCUSS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MATTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M TO HAVE MANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBER STATION **** ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET ALLOCATION AND ALL OF THE GREAT WORK THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THIS FUND.
