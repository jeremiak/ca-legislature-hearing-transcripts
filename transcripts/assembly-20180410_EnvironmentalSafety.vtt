ARE THOSE THE ONES THAT ARE

CHRONICALLY NON. AND AS A RESULT

00:35:14.813 --> 00:35:17.782 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T PROVIDE RELIABLE

00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:41.072 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:43.842 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY FIFTY IS A BIG PART OF

SMALL WATER SYSTEM.

00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:51.950 region:rollup2
AND IT DOES THIS BY CREATING A

LAUGH CHO DRIVEN PROCESS.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:56.454 region:rollup2
IN WHICH ALL NON COMPLIANT WATER

00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:58.289 region:rollup2

00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:59.958 region:rollup2
ONE FUNCTIONAL WATER SYSTEM.

00:35:58.289 --> 00:36:01.493 region:rollup2
THIS PROVIDES IMPROVED ECONOMIES

FOR SOME REASON THE BOARD

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:48.780 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THESE NEW DISTRICTS

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:51.015 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE PAID NEARLY

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.983 region:rollup2
DOUBLE THAN OTHER MUNICIPAL

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:54.352 region:rollup2
WATER BOARD MEMBERS.

00:40:51.983 --> 00:40:55.853 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO MY ANALYSIS I'M

00:40:54.352 --> 00:40:58.056 region:rollup2
NOT SURE WHY THAT IS.

00:40:55.853 --> 00:41:00.358 region:rollup2
YOU GUYS ARE SHAKING YOUR HEADS

00:40:58.056 --> 00:41:02.060 region:rollup2
NOW SELL. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:41:00.358 --> 00:41:03.928 region:rollup2
THAT TO BE THE CASE.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.563 region:rollup2
NO NO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT TO

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:07.498 region:rollup2
BE THE CASE AT ALL.

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:08.333 region:rollup2
NOT SURE WHY WHY THAT'S COME UP

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:12.103 region:rollup2
IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL.

00:41:08.333 --> 00:41:14.972 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:41:12.103 --> 00:41:16.941 region:rollup2
I AM.

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:18.676 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS TO PAY BACK.

00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:23.648 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL OWNERS.

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:24.749 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:25.583 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR THREE YEARS TO PAY

00:41:24.749 --> 00:41:27.318 region:rollup2
BACK AND THAT'S.

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:29.220 region:rollup2
.

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:30.955 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING WHY IT'S THE IT'S

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:32.824 region:rollup2
NOT SEEN AS A LONG.

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:34.926 region:rollup2
JEFF THEY WAS OUR CONTEMPLATION

00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:36.661 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE MAKING IT. EVEN A YEAR

00:41:34.926 --> 00:41:40.098 region:rollup2
LESS THAN THAT EARNED. YOU KNOW

00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:42.100 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M IT THIS THIS IS ON.

00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:43.768 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CONCEPT BEHIND THIS

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.504 region:rollup2
IS THAT ALL OF THESE ARE NON

00:41:43.768 --> 00:41:48.139 region:rollup2
COMPLIANT WATER DISTRICTS ARE.

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:50.475 region:rollup2
UP FINANCIALLY STRAPPED LEAGUE

00:41:48.139 --> 00:41:52.276 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE.

00:41:50.475 --> 00:41:53.745 region:rollup2
UNCONTAMINATED A DRINKING WATER

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:55.113 region:rollup2
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND SO WHAT

00:41:53.745 --> 00:41:56.781 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS GIVE

00:41:55.113 --> 00:41:58.082 region:rollup2
THEM ENOUGH TIME TO BE ABLE TO.

00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:59.083 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THIS CONSOLIDATION

00:41:58.082 --> 00:42:01.719 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:03.721 region:rollup2
GET A NEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:04.989 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE THERE WILL BE A

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:05.723 region:rollup2
CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP.

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:07.759 region:rollup2
HIRE THE STAFF THAT THEY'RE

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:09.026 region:rollup2
GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO NOW

00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:10.595 region:rollup2
BECOME COMPLAINT WITH STATE LAW

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.562 region:rollup2
AND WE WANT TO GIVE THEM ENOUGH

00:42:10.595 --> 00:42:13.131 region:rollup2
TIME TO BE ABLE TO PAY OFF ANY

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:15.566 region:rollup2
DEBTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE DOING

00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:17.702 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT. THE PROCESS AND.

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:18.836 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT PART OF THE

00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:20.171 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF DOING THESE

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:22.106 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATIONS ISN'T THERE

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:23.975 region:rollup2
REALLY IS STATE MONEY IT AT THE

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:25.576 region:rollup2
WATER BOARD FOR DISADVANTAGED

00:42:23.975 --> 00:42:27.645 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BUT THESE PARTICULAR

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:28.880 region:rollup2
WATER. DISTRICTS HAVE NOT BEEN

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:30.481 region:rollup2
ABLE OUR WATER ORGANIZATIONS

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.115 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS IT

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:32.216 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:34.252 region:rollup2
THERE. THAT.

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:35.486 region:rollup2
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

00:42:34.252 --> 00:42:36.888 region:rollup2
THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFF

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:37.855 region:rollup2
THAT ONCE THEY IF THEY COULD GET

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:40.324 region:rollup2
A GRANT THAT COULD ACTUALLY

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:43.127 region:rollup2
EXECUTED SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT.

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:45.496 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IT'S THE BITS THE M..

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:47.165 region:rollup2
THAT THE NEW BOARD.

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:49.133 region:rollup2
HIRING NEW STAFF AND BRINGING

00:42:47.165 --> 00:42:50.435 region:rollup2
THE MOM BOARD IT MAY TAKE THEM

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:51.769 region:rollup2
AWHILE TO BE ABLE TO PAY.

00:42:50.435 --> 00:42:53.004 region:rollup2
THEIR OBLIGATIONS BACK AND

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:54.472 region:rollup2
FRANKLY IF THEY CAN GET IT DONE

00:42:53.004 --> 00:42:55.873 region:rollup2
IN ONE OR TWO YEARS THAT'S GREAT

00:42:54.472 --> 00:42:57.141 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T WANT IT SET THEM UP

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:58.576 region:rollup2
FOR FAILURE IMMEDIATELY BY

00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:59.544 region:rollup2
HAVING THEM PAY FOR SOMETHING

00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:00.344 region:rollup2
THAT THEY. ON THIS VERY

00:42:59.544 --> 00:43:02.513 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:02.713 region:rollup2
THAT'S A THOUGHT.

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:04.816 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:05.883 region:rollup2
.

00:43:04.816 --> 00:43:07.685 region:rollup2
I STILL THINK THREE YEARS IS A

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:08.686 region:rollup2
LONG TIME DEBT BUT I I GET WHERE

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:10.354 region:rollup2
YOU'RE COMING FROM.

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:13.157 region:rollup2
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT I THINK

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:14.625 region:rollup2
FLY IN THIS BILL FOR ME IS THAT

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:16.561 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO VOTER APPROVAL

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:16.994 region:rollup2
REQUIRED FOR ISSUING THESE BONDS

00:43:16.561 --> 00:43:19.097 region:rollup2
AND I FIND THAT VERY

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:20.431 region:rollup2
TROUBLESOME.

00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:22.567 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY I CANNOT SUPPORT

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:25.736 region:rollup2
THE BILL TODAY I'M I'M NOT SURE

00:43:22.567 --> 00:43:27.872 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S ROOM FOR NEGOTIATING

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:29.507 region:rollup2
ON THAT BUT. I THINK IT'S VERY

00:43:27.872 --> 00:43:30.775 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT IF IF THE RATE

00:43:29.507 --> 00:43:32.443 region:rollup2
PAYERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE

00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:34.245 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE PAYING FOR THESE

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:35.613 region:rollup2
BONDS THAT THEY HAVE A SAY IN

00:43:34.245 --> 00:43:36.948 region:rollup2
WHETHER NOT THOSE BONDS ARE

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:39.016 region:rollup2
ISSUED AND I THINK IF THEY HAVE.

00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:40.284 region:rollup2
CONTINUED OVER THE YEARS HAVE

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:42.153 region:rollup2
BEEN DELIVERED.

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:43.888 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATED WATER NOT HAVE

00:43:42.153 --> 00:43:46.290 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER IT THEY

00:43:43.888 --> 00:43:47.358 region:rollup2
WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO PAY INTO

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:49.227 region:rollup2
THOSE IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT THEY

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:50.394 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER

00:43:49.227 --> 00:43:52.230 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:54.432 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TO. TO ISSUE THESE

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.901 region:rollup2
BONDS WITHOUT VOTER APPROVAL AM

00:43:54.432 --> 00:43:58.436 region:rollup2
I I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY COULD I

00:43:56.901 --> 00:43:59.737 region:rollup2
USE THE REFERENDUM PROCESS IF

00:43:58.436 --> 00:44:01.105 region:rollup2
THEY WEREN'T SATISFIED WITH THIS

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:02.807 region:rollup2
BUT THAT IS PUTTING THE BURDEN.

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:04.008 region:rollup2
ON THE RATEPAYERS AT THE BACK

00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:06.110 region:rollup2
AND RATHER THAN PUTTING THE

00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:07.311 region:rollup2
BURDEN ON THE WATER DISTRICT AT

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.413 region:rollup2
THE FRONT AND WHICH I THINK

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.014 region:rollup2
MAKES MORE SENSE OUT.

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:12.917 region:rollup2
.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:41.017 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A NINETY DAY REVIEW

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:42.852 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:45.121 region:rollup2
A PROCESS NOW THAT WE'VE AGREED

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:46.990 region:rollup2

HAVEN'T HAD PROBLEMS.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:50.927 region:rollup2
THAT IF THEY SUBMIT A.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:52.228 region:rollup2
TOM

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:54.230 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE THEY SUBMIT

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:56.933 region:rollup2
THE RENEWAL.

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:59.369 region:rollup2

THEY HAVEN'T GONE ALL THROUGH

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:08.278 region:rollup2
ALL THE PROCEDURES THERE WOULD

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:11.481 region:rollup2
THEN BE A LAWSUIT.

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:12.349 region:rollup2

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:14.250 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE GONNA FINISH THEY

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:16.152 region:rollup2

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:18.021 region:rollup2
JUST SAINTS OF THE NINETY DAYS

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:19.889 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ORIGINALLY THERE.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:22.025 region:rollup2
THE DIFFICULTY WITH THAT WAS

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:24.260 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN IF FOR NINETY YEARS IF

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:25.829 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT DONE RIGHT.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.732 region:rollup2
PERMIT ISN'T GONNA STAND

01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:30.633 region:rollup2
SO WE ASSUME THAT.

01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:31.868 region:rollup2
A PERMIT WILL BE DONE CORRECTLY

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:33.703 region:rollup2

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:34.971 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TWO AND A HALF YEARS NOT

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.539 region:rollup2
NINETY DAYS SO IT'S VERY

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:38.041 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT. THAN THE ORIGINAL

PERMIT WHEN IT DOESN'T ACT IN A

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:51.087 region:rollup2
TIMELY FASHION THE LOSE IN THAT

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:52.322 region:rollup2
CASE ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT

LIVE BY THESE FACILITIES.

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:55.592 region:rollup2
WE NEED THOROUGH REVIEW IN EVERY

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:57.060 region:rollup2
CASE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT DTS

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:57.961 region:rollup2

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:04.401 region:rollup2
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A.

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:05.135 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.336 region:rollup2

SO.

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:13.510 region:rollup2
WE WOULD URGE THAT THERE BE MORE

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:15.478 region:rollup2

REVIEW THESE TYPES OF DECISIONS

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:25.622 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT MADE IN A

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.191 region:rollup2
TIMELY FASHION. BUT SIMPLY

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:29.959 region:rollup2
ALLOWING A A FACILITY PERMIT TO

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:32.395 region:rollup2
BE GRANTED WHEN DTC FAILS ACT IN

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:35.365 region:rollup2
A TIMELY FASHION. AGAIN DOESN'T

HAVE QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:21.130 region:rollup2
CONCERNS RAISED BY THE.

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:21.364 region:rollup2

01:08:21.364 --> 01:08:28.104 region:rollup2
.

01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:30.640 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS LIKE A.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:32.809 region:rollup2
THE PERMITS WOULD BE OBTAINED

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.077 region:rollup2
APPROVED ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT THE

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:36.012 region:rollup2
CASE IT WOULD NOT BE DEEMED

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:38.715 region:rollup2
APPROVED WE GIVEN THE DEADLINE

01:08:36.012 --> 01:08:40.750 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT DEEMED APPROVED.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:41.284 region:rollup2
IT WAS A LIMITS ACCEPTED YEAH

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.852 region:rollup2
AND SO IT DOES NOT SEEM TO

01:08:41.284 --> 01:08:45.588 region:rollup2
PROVE.

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:46.589 region:rollup2
IT THE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE IF

01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:47.490 region:rollup2
IT HAS TO.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:48.758 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE GIVEN THEM THE

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.226 region:rollup2
DEADLINE WITH THE HOPE THAT THEY

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:52.061 region:rollup2
WILL MAKE.

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:52.595 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WOULD BE NO POINT EVEN

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:54.297 region:rollup2
IF YOU MADE IT NINETY NINE

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:56.466 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:08:54.297 --> 01:08:58.835 region:rollup2

BEING SUED AND THE PERMIT ISN'T

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:06.175 region:rollup2
WORTH THE PAPER IT'S WRITTEN ON.

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:07.043 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS NO DEEMED APPROVED

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:08.611 region:rollup2
ON BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM THE

01:09:07.043 --> 01:09:10.680 region:rollup2
DEADLINE.

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:12.682 region:rollup2

THAT. OTHER WILL BE A CAP AND I

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:34.003 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IS FAIR OF THAT

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:34.871 region:rollup2
NUMBER IS GOING TO BE DETERMINED

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:36.839 region:rollup2

01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:32.788 region:rollup2
FIRST SOLUTION WOULD WORK WE DO

THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS IT

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:52.341 region:rollup2
SCHEME TO PROVE BECAUSE IT WOULD

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:54.277 region:rollup2
MAKE NO SENSE.

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:56.913 region:rollup2

HAVE QUESTIONS TO THE OPPONENTS

01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:33.648 region:rollup2
I MEAN. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:27:32.114 --> 01:27:35.083 region:rollup2
BILL IS AT THIS.

01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:36.818 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE BILL IS

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:39.621 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOMEOWNER

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:42.324 region:rollup2

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:44.493 region:rollup2
LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS KNOWING

01:27:42.324 --> 01:27:45.293 region:rollup2
USE OF THEIR PRODUCT AND HOMES

01:27:44.493 --> 01:27:49.197 region:rollup2
BY.

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:50.832 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE.

01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:52.167 region:rollup2
A GUY I DON'T REALLY.

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:54.436 region:rollup2
HERE EITHER OF YOU ADDRESSING

01:27:52.167 --> 01:27:56.271 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE.

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:58.173 region:rollup2
SO THE BILL I AM DOES CERTAINLY

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:59.875 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO LARGELY THE LIABILITY

01:27:58.173 --> 01:28:01.910 region:rollup2
FACTOR FOR HOMEOWNERS BUT

01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:04.079 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY AS THE WAY THE BILL

01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:05.413 region:rollup2
IS CONSTRUCTED IN AND AROUND.

01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:07.849 region:rollup2
THE HAZARDOUS GUYS SUBSTANCE

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:10.152 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT ACT ALSO IN DOING SO.

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:12.220 region:rollup2
DESIGNATES THESE HOMES ALLIES

01:28:10.152 --> 01:28:14.456 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS WASTE SUPERFUND SITES

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.990 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S THE COMBINATION OF

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:17.359 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC NUISANCE COURT

01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:18.660 region:rollup2
RULING.

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:20.428 region:rollup2
AT THAT ALREADY IS BECAUSE IT IS

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:22.797 region:rollup2
BASICALLY DEEMING THOSE HOMES A

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:24.399 region:rollup2
PUBLIC NUISANCE YOU UP ON TOP OF

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:26.134 region:rollup2
THAT THE FACT THAT.

01:28:24.399 --> 01:28:27.068 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS BILL AYE THOSE HOMES

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:29.004 region:rollup2
WOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:30.338 region:rollup2
SUPERFUND SITES SO FROM A

01:28:29.004 --> 01:28:32.307 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER PERSPECTIVE AS WELL

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:34.142 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ALSO HAVING IMPLICATIONS

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:34.943 region:rollup2
FOR PROPERTY VALUES.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.778 region:rollup2
AND.

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:39.147 region:rollup2
AN INTERN AS WELL WITH

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:41.349 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS HAVE MEAN LIABILITY

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:43.251 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS PERHAPS YOU KNOW

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:44.953 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CONVERSATION TO BE HAD

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:46.521 region:rollup2
AROUND NEAR THE SUBSET OF

01:28:44.953 --> 01:28:49.157 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS WHO'VE DONE THE RIGHT

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:51.526 region:rollup2
THING. PEERING COMPASS SEEN

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:53.829 region:rollup2
EVERYONE INCLUDING LANDLORDS WHO

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:56.198 region:rollup2
HAVE MAY HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT AND

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:58.466 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY OVERLAIN ALL OF THIS

01:28:56.198 --> 01:29:00.202 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOMEOWNERS

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:03.238 region:rollup2
AND WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR

01:29:00.202 --> 01:29:04.039 region:rollup2
HOMES DEEMED SUPERFUND SITES.

01:29:03.238 --> 01:29:04.673 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN

01:29:04.039 --> 01:29:05.273 region:rollup2
PROP DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT IN

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.274 region:rollup2
TERMS OF PROPERLY MAINTAINING

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:07.275 region:rollup2
THEIR HOMES MAKING SURE THAT

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:08.743 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO CHIPPING IN ON THE

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:09.744 region:rollup2
WALLS OF THE OF THEIR PAINT. AND

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.812 region:rollup2
WHAT HAVE YOU SO THE COMBINATION

01:29:09.744 --> 01:29:11.947 region:rollup2
OF ALL OF THAT BUT THIS BILL IS

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:14.149 region:rollup2
NOT MAKING HOMES A SUPERFUND

01:29:11.947 --> 01:29:15.817 region:rollup2
SITE DOES THE COURT. DECISION

01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:18.253 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS BILL IS TRYING TO

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:19.855 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT HOMEOWNERS ARE

01:29:18.253 --> 01:29:21.156 region:rollup2
NOT HELD LIABLE.

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:23.658 region:rollup2
SO THOUGH QUIRK HE SAYS I

01:29:21.156 --> 01:29:26.127 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT ACTUALLY DEEMS ARE

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:28.763 region:rollup2
THE HOMES PUBLIC NUISANCES I

01:29:26.127 --> 01:29:29.898 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SEPARATE AND APART FROM

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:31.299 region:rollup2
JEANNINE AND MANKIND SUPERFUND

01:29:29.898 --> 01:29:33.468 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES WHICH

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:34.703 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CONSTRUCTED THIS BILL.

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:36.104 region:rollup2
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS

01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:37.405 region:rollup2
BILL ACTUALLY DEALS WITH THE

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:39.808 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS WASTE SUPERFUND

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:41.509 region:rollup2
COMPONENT. PUBLIC NUISANCE

01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:42.978 region:rollup2
PIECES A SEPARATE PEACE DEALT

01:29:41.509 --> 01:29:44.679 region:rollup2
WITH BY THE COURT SO IT'S TWO

01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:46.414 region:rollup2
SEPARATE COMPONENTS. THAT WHEN

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:47.682 region:rollup2
PAIRED TOGETHER EXACERBATING THE

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:49.985 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES FOR HOMEOWNERS

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:51.586 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO PROPERTY VALUES AND

01:29:49.985 --> 01:29:53.188 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS FOR ABOUT SO WHAT

01:29:51.586 --> 01:29:55.357 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THE DISCUSSION

01:29:53.188 --> 01:29:56.891 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO KIND OF LIABILITY

WE DON'T DISCOVER IT RIGHT AWAY

01:50:11.138 --> 01:50:15.209 region:rollup2

01:50:13.774 --> 01:50:16.844 region:rollup2
PEOPLE I ESPECIALLY IF IT'S

01:50:15.209 --> 01:50:18.178 region:rollup2

LEADERSHIP IS DETERMINED THAT

01:51:39.593 --> 01:51:43.197 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS A HOUSING KILLER WE

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:44.565 region:rollup2
HAVE. GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW

01:51:43.197 --> 01:51:46.133 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD PLAY OUT.

01:51:44.565 --> 01:51:49.136 region:rollup2
IN REALITY IN WHICH WE WORK

01:51:46.133 --> 01:51:50.571 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING TO REALLY IDENTIFY

01:51:49.136 --> 01:51:52.506 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE DEFICIENCY IN

01:51:50.571 --> 01:51:54.942 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW.

01:51:52.506 --> 01:51:57.544 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT PERSONAL INJURY

01:51:54.942 --> 01:51:59.112 region:rollup2
CLAIMS TO PROCEED BASED ON WHAT

01:51:57.544 --> 01:52:01.148 region:rollup2
WATER CONTAMINATION WE'D YOU

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:02.449 region:rollup2
KNOW. IN NO WAY IS MEANT TO SAY

01:52:01.148 --> 01:52:04.351 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T THINK WATER

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:06.053 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION IS A PROBLEM.

01:52:04.351 --> 01:52:08.555 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S CURRENT A CODE

01:52:06.053 --> 01:52:10.057 region:rollup2
SECTION THREE FORTY POINT EIGHT

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:11.858 region:rollup2
OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.

01:52:10.057 --> 01:52:14.027 region:rollup2
WHICH ALLOWS.

01:52:11.858 --> 01:52:16.230 region:rollup2
A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME FOR THE

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:17.998 region:rollup2
DISCOVERY OF THE CUP WATER

01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:20.234 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION THERE'S NO TIME

01:52:17.998 --> 01:52:21.835 region:rollup2
LIMIT. ON DISCOVERING THAT YOU

01:52:20.234 --> 01:52:23.804 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ILLNESS OR AN INJURY.

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:25.772 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO TIME LIMIT.

01:52:23.804 --> 01:52:27.441 region:rollup2
TO DISCOVER THAT BECAUSE OF THAT

01:52:25.772 --> 01:52:30.143 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO TIME LIMIT ON

01:52:27.441 --> 01:52:31.244 region:rollup2
DETERMINING WHO'S TO BLAME. AND

01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:33.413 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S A TWO YEAR STATUTE

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:35.115 region:rollup2
OF LIMITATIONS AFTER THAT POINT.

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:36.683 region:rollup2
A FILED THE LAWSUIT

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:38.819 region:rollup2
SO WE WE FEEL THAT THERE IS

01:52:36.683 --> 01:52:40.721 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW SUFFICIENT ENOUGH

01:52:38.819 --> 01:52:41.788 region:rollup2
TO COVER THESE CLAIMS. A WE DO

01:52:40.721 --> 01:52:43.390 region:rollup2
INTEND TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE

01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:45.025 region:rollup2
AUTHORS OFFICE BUT AT THIS POINT

01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:46.460 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IT. AS BEING

01:52:45.025 --> 01:52:48.629 region:rollup2
VERY DETRIMENTAL TO THE HOUSING

01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:52.132 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY DURING A THE HOUSING

01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:53.100 region:rollup2
CRISIS AT WORK CURRENTLY FACING.

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:54.835 region:rollup2
MY NAME IS JERRY HERMAN I

01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:55.369 region:rollup2
REPRESENT THE AMERICAN COUNCIL

01:52:54.835 --> 01:52:56.737 region:rollup2
OF ENGINEERING COMPANIES.

01:52:55.369 --> 01:52:58.438 region:rollup2
.

01:52:56.737 --> 01:52:59.773 region:rollup2
INSERTION OF THE WORD PERSONAL

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.741 region:rollup2
IS HELPFUL BUT IT'S MY

01:52:59.773 --> 01:53:02.042 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LAW

01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:03.810 region:rollup2
DOESN'T APPLY TO PERSONAL INJURY

01:53:02.042 --> 01:53:05.045 region:rollup2
CASES NOW.

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:06.346 region:rollup2
SO IT'S MERELY A I THINK

01:53:05.045 --> 01:53:07.748 region:rollup2
CODIFYING PERHAPS THE MARTINEZ

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:09.349 region:rollup2
CASE.

01:53:07.748 --> 01:53:09.983 region:rollup2
WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE

01:53:09.349 --> 01:53:12.252 region:rollup2
OF THE EXPRESSION WATER

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:13.420 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION.

01:53:12.252 --> 01:53:15.656 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT ANY LEVEL.

01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:17.824 region:rollup2
.

01:53:15.656 --> 01:53:19.626 region:rollup2
AND IT COULD INCLUDE NATURAL

01:53:17.824 --> 01:53:21.862 region:rollup2
CONTAMINANTS.

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:25.132 region:rollup2
DOES THIS IN ANY MANNER DISPOSE.

01:53:21.862 --> 01:53:27.501 region:rollup2
OR REDUCE THE CAUSATION.

01:53:25.132 --> 01:53:30.070 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK IT DOES BUT IT

01:53:27.501 --> 01:53:31.872 region:rollup2
RAISES A HOST OF ISSUES THE

01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:34.875 region:rollup2
EXPRESSION WATER CONTAMINATION.

01:53:31.872 --> 01:53:36.677 region:rollup2
MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE.

01:53:34.875 --> 01:53:38.512 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCES THAT WE TYPICALLY

01:53:36.677 --> 01:53:39.913 region:rollup2
THINK OF AS HAZARDOUS.

01:53:38.512 --> 01:53:42.315 region:rollup2
PUT TOXIC IT'S JUST

01:53:39.913 --> 01:53:43.684 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION SO I THINK THE

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:45.986 region:rollup2
BILL NEEDS CONSIDERABLE

SO. I THINK THAT WE CAN WORK

01:55:36.963 --> 01:55:40.867 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO EXAMS RESIDENCES

THAT.

01:55:55.949 --> 01:56:00.120 region:rollup2
OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS WHAT IS

01:55:58.852 --> 01:56:01.421 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT TYPE OF CONTAMINATION

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.923 region:rollup2
WE CAN CERTAINLY NARROW THAT

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:04.090 region:rollup2
DEFINITION AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:56:02.923 --> 01:56:05.458 region:rollup2

01:56:04.090 --> 01:56:07.828 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME CURRENT.

01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:09.062 region:rollup2
CASE LAW WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO

DO IS TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE

01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:11.765 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN VERY AMBIGUOUS IN THE

TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE THAT

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:19.472 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD CONTAMINATION THERE'S

01:56:18.238 --> 01:56:20.774 region:rollup2
ONE CASE THAT INVOLVES A SCHOOL

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:23.176 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THAT DISCOVERED THAT A

01:56:20.774 --> 01:56:24.778 region:rollup2

CREATIVE WAYSOF GETTING RELIEF

01:56:30.884 --> 01:56:35.188 region:rollup2

I'M THAT'S WHAT WE SEEK TO DO IS

01:56:35.188 --> 01:56:37.624 region:rollup2
TO REALLY CLARIFY THE LAW TO

01:56:36.323 --> 01:56:38.959 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE PEOPLE DO HAVE A

01:56:37.624 --> 01:56:39.593 region:rollup2
COURSE OF ACTION IF THEY'VE BEEN

01:56:38.959 --> 01:56:40.994 region:rollup2

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:47.601 region:rollup2
STATUTE NEEDS TO BE EXTENDED

01:56:45.932 --> 01:56:48.435 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IS CONTAMINATION AND

01:56:47.601 --> 01:56:50.737 region:rollup2
IT TAKES A NUMBER OF YEARS TO

01:56:48.435 --> 01:56:51.671 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FIND OUT WHERE THE

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:52.572 region:rollup2

BUT IN THE BOBCATS IN THE LOS

02:09:18.017 --> 02:09:20.786 region:rollup2

JOURNEY SORRY I APOLOGIZE. BUT

02:09:31.063 --> 02:09:34.967 region:rollup2
WE'VE OBSERVED ON CELLULAR.

02:09:33.399 --> 02:09:36.769 region:rollup2

02:09:34.967 --> 02:09:38.738 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF GENE EXPRESSION.

02:09:36.769 --> 02:09:40.740 region:rollup2
THAT THESE RODENTICIDE HAVE

02:09:38.738 --> 02:09:43.442 region:rollup2
SEVERE SYSTEMIC IMPACTS ON

02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:43.943 region:rollup2

.

02:09:47.046 --> 02:09:49.682 region:rollup2
SO TO SAY THAT THE EFFECTS ON

02:09:48.514 --> 02:09:52.118 region:rollup2
THE IMMUNE FUNCTION CAN HAVE

02:09:49.682 --> 02:09:53.753 region:rollup2

02:09:55.121 --> 02:09:58.858 region:rollup2
IN A VARIETY OF SPECIES

02:09:57.156 --> 02:10:00.493 region:rollup2
I'M WOULD ALSO LIKE TO JUST

02:09:58.858 --> 02:10:01.594 region:rollup2
EMPHASIZE THAT THESE METHODS OF

02:10:01.594 --> 02:10:04.196 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER METHODS

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:05.831 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE DEVISED.

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:06.932 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT WE ARGUE THAT

02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:07.633 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE GIVEN

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.768 region:rollup2
THAT RODENTS HAVE SHORT

02:10:07.633 --> 02:10:10.102 region:rollup2

ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE

02:22:55.801 --> 02:22:58.870 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES

02:22:57.002 --> 02:23:00.772 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY FLAT APPLYING.

KEEPING DANCERS CLOSED UP.

02:23:10.849 --> 02:23:14.486 region:rollup2
BEYOND SNAPCHAT'S A VERY

02:23:12.384 --> 02:23:16.755 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AND THEY HAVE TO BE

ARE INVOLVED GENERALLY BE DE

02:23:25.130 --> 02:23:29.367 region:rollup2
AND IRAQ THERE ALSO ELECTRIC CAT

02:23:27.799 --> 02:23:31.470 region:rollup2
RATHER CATERS IS WHAT THEY'RE

02:23:29.367 --> 02:23:34.139 region:rollup2
CALLED WHERE THE HECK RAT ENTERS

02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:37.609 region:rollup2
AND IS GONE HE REALLY LIKES

02:23:34.139 --> 02:23:38.777 region:rollup2
QUICKLY DONE.

02:23:37.609 --> 02:23:40.579 region:rollup2
ELECTROCUTED.

02:23:38.777 --> 02:23:42.948 region:rollup2
AND I I JUST I KNOW THAT DAD

02:23:40.579 --> 02:23:44.115 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE INSTANCES WHERE AND

02:23:42.948 --> 02:23:44.749 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ARE AT.

02:23:44.115 --> 02:23:46.818 region:rollup2
AT COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES HAVE

02:23:44.749 --> 02:23:48.787 region:rollup2
MOVED FROM THE USING PAPER

02:23:46.818 --> 02:23:50.155 region:rollup2
POISON TO USING THE SNAP TRAFFIC

02:23:48.787 --> 02:23:52.724 region:rollup2
SPREAD PRIMARY DEFENSE.

02:23:50.155 --> 02:23:53.325 region:rollup2
THERE I IN MY INTERVIEWS WITH

02:23:52.724 --> 02:23:55.026 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO OF YOU SAYS THAT

02:23:53.325 --> 02:23:56.428 region:rollup2
PATSY NO COMPLAINTS OF ANYTHING

02:23:55.026 --> 02:23:58.930 region:rollup2
THEY FOUND THEY HAD BETTER

02:23:56.428 --> 02:24:00.298 region:rollup2
READING CONTROL. WHICH IS WHY A

02:23:58.930 --> 02:24:01.833 region:rollup2
CITY OR A COUNTY LIKE MARIN

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:03.735 region:rollup2
COUNTY WHICH IS SINCE TWO

02:24:01.833 --> 02:24:06.271 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND NINE NOT USED ANY

02:24:03.735 --> 02:24:07.772 region:rollup2
POISON ON HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL

02:24:06.271 --> 02:24:10.575 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THEY INVADE MANAGED

02:24:07.772 --> 02:24:11.610 region:rollup2
A FACILITY SUCH AS THAT UNIT

02:24:10.575 --> 02:24:13.111 region:rollup2
THAT FRANKLY RIGHT.

02:24:11.610 --> 02:24:13.378 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY CENTER WHICH HAS A LOT

02:24:13.111 --> 02:24:16.481 region:rollup2
OF THEM.

02:24:13.378 --> 02:24:18.216 region:rollup2
EVENTS AND FOOD ORIENTED AND

02:24:16.481 --> 02:24:20.151 region:rollup2
OCCASIONS THERE THERE STILL I'M

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:21.753 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT WITH THE AND THE

02:24:20.151 --> 02:24:22.954 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF THE AYE

02:24:21.753 --> 02:24:25.624 region:rollup2
SANITATION AND.

02:24:22.954 --> 02:24:27.359 region:rollup2
I HABITATION AND THAT STEPPED

02:24:25.624 --> 02:24:28.527 region:rollup2
OUT SO THEY HAVE BEEN VERY AND

02:24:27.359 --> 02:24:29.494 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT HAD A PROBLEM HAVE NOT

02:24:28.527 --> 02:24:31.897 region:rollup2
HAD A SINGLE REQUEST COME

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:34.166 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN TEN YEARS ALMOST FOUR

02:24:31.897 --> 02:24:35.700 region:rollup2
AND EIGHT TO USE PESTICIDES.

02:24:34.166 --> 02:24:38.069 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:40.305 region:rollup2
ARMED.

02:24:38.069 --> 02:24:41.640 region:rollup2
SO IT'S PRIMARILY THAT THE

02:24:40.305 --> 02:24:42.974 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT TRAPS NOT TRAPPED

02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:44.910 region:rollup2
IN OUR AND ENVIRONMENTAL.

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:46.745 region:rollup2
MITIGATION OKAY AND AN EGRESS

02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:48.380 region:rollup2
KIT PREVENTING RATS FROM

02:24:46.745 --> 02:24:50.015 region:rollup2
ENTERING.

02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:51.383 region:rollup2
SITES WE DON'T WANT A A

02:24:50.015 --> 02:24:54.452 region:rollup2
SCREENING PGA.

02:24:51.383 --> 02:24:57.389 region:rollup2
AYE ENTRIES TO A TO HOMES.

02:24:54.452 --> 02:24:59.891 region:rollup2
BY FILLING HOLES. OF THE CAN

02:24:57.389 --> 02:25:02.027 region:rollup2
ALLOW INGRESS THAN AN EGRESS.

02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:04.529 region:rollup2
ARE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE

02:25:02.027 --> 02:25:06.798 region:rollup2
FOR UP FOR RODENT CONTROL ALWAYS

02:25:04.529 --> 02:25:07.098 region:rollup2
REMOVING VEGETATION AWAY FROM.

02:25:06.798 --> 02:25:09.201 region:rollup2
THE.

02:25:07.098 --> 02:25:11.937 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT UP AGAINST A HOUSE

02:25:09.201 --> 02:25:12.304 region:rollup2
OF THICK VINES THAT GROW NEARBY

02:25:11.937 --> 02:25:15.373 region:rollup2
ARE FREQUENTLY.

02:25:12.304 --> 02:25:18.043 region:rollup2
A BREEDING GROUNDS FOR RODENTS

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:19.544 region:rollup2
THESE ARE UNPROVEN A AND VERY

02:25:18.043 --> 02:25:21.846 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE METHODS.

02:25:19.544 --> 02:25:22.013 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT WE HAD A MENTION OF

02:25:21.846 --> 02:25:24.082 region:rollup2
THE.

02:25:22.013 --> 02:25:25.684 region:rollup2
A LECTURE GOTTA A RADICULAR

02:25:24.082 --> 02:25:28.119 region:rollup2
LIKE VIEWS DATA THOSE OVER THE

02:25:25.684 --> 02:25:29.387 region:rollup2
LAST FIVE YEARS AT AT MY HOME

02:25:28.119 --> 02:25:31.756 region:rollup2
THEY'VE PROVEN VERY EFFECTIVE

02:25:29.387 --> 02:25:32.591 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT

02:25:31.756 --> 02:25:33.925 region:rollup2
THEM AND.

02:25:32.591 --> 02:25:36.695 region:rollup2
IS HAVE BEEN REFERENCED IN THE

02:25:33.925 --> 02:25:37.195 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION HERE IS THAT THEY

02:25:36.695 --> 02:25:38.897 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:25:37.195 --> 02:25:41.466 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH SEVERAL

02:25:38.897 --> 02:25:44.636 region:rollup2
GENERATIONS OF IMPROVEMENTS

02:25:41.466 --> 02:25:45.537 region:rollup2
UP TO THAT EQUIPMENT AND.

02:25:44.636 --> 02:25:47.138 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE CAN

02:25:45.537 --> 02:25:48.807 region:rollup2
EXPECT TO SEE AS WE MOVE DOWN

02:25:47.138 --> 02:25:51.376 region:rollup2
THE PATH OF IMPLEMENTING

02:25:48.807 --> 02:25:54.179 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. IS.

02:25:51.376 --> 02:25:56.948 region:rollup2
A A A A MORE INNOVATION AND

02:25:54.179 --> 02:25:58.817 region:rollup2
DATA USING PROVEN STRATEGIES

02:25:56.948 --> 02:26:01.186 region:rollup2
THAT DID NOT INVOLVE USING

02:25:58.817 --> 02:26:02.520 region:rollup2
POISON.

02:26:01.186 --> 02:26:03.888 region:rollup2
I CAN YOU KNOW MISTER BLOOM AYE

02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:05.357 region:rollup2
I'M A.

02:26:03.888 --> 02:26:06.057 region:rollup2
PRODUCT OF THE SEVENTIES AND

02:26:05.357 --> 02:26:09.027 region:rollup2
MAYBE I WATCHED TOO MANY OF

02:26:06.057 --> 02:26:11.263 region:rollup2
THOSE MOVIES OF OF RATS THE.

02:26:09.027 --> 02:26:13.098 region:rollup2
TAKEN OVER AND COMMUNITIES.

02:26:11.263 --> 02:26:15.667 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS READING

02:26:13.098 --> 02:26:17.335 region:rollup2
THE. ANALYSIS OF THE THE THE

02:26:15.667 --> 02:26:19.971 region:rollup2
PEST CONTROL OPERATORS ARE

02:26:17.335 --> 02:26:20.372 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HERE. RODENTS WITH

02:26:19.971 --> 02:26:22.240 region:rollup2
THE BONNET PLAGUE.

02:26:20.372 --> 02:26:23.508 region:rollup2
.

02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:25.343 region:rollup2
BEEN DEAD DO I UNDERSTAND

02:26:23.508 --> 02:26:28.580 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME PROVISION ABOUT.

02:26:25.343 --> 02:26:30.215 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC HEALTH EXCEPTIONS GOOD.

02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:31.383 region:rollup2
THERE ARE AND AND OF COURSE WE

02:26:30.215 --> 02:26:32.751 region:rollup2
ALWAYS ESPECIALLY IN THIS DAY

02:26:31.383 --> 02:26:34.919 region:rollup2
AND AGE HAVE TO BE. A

02:26:32.751 --> 02:26:37.055 region:rollup2
CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT TO

02:26:34.919 --> 02:26:38.790 region:rollup2
SEPARATING FACT FROM FICTION.

02:26:37.055 --> 02:26:41.359 region:rollup2
OF ME WHEN I HER A OF BOTH THAT

02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:42.527 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING HOLLYWOOD UP AND I

02:26:41.359 --> 02:26:43.795 region:rollup2
THINK YOU HOPE.

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:45.664 region:rollup2
WERE PRETTY GOOD STEP OF BEING

02:26:43.795 --> 02:26:46.865 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT.

02:26:45.664 --> 02:26:47.032 region:rollup2
.

02:26:46.865 --> 02:26:48.166 region:rollup2
THE.

02:26:47.032 --> 02:26:49.868 region:rollup2
.

02:26:48.166 --> 02:26:51.369 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER HERE

02:26:49.868 --> 02:26:53.772 region:rollup2
IS I THINK WHAT THE GOAL IS AND

02:26:51.369 --> 02:26:57.409 region:rollup2
THAT IS REDUCING ACCESS IN THE

02:26:53.772 --> 02:26:58.777 region:rollup2
USE OF ACCESS TO IN THE USE. OF

02:26:57.409 --> 02:27:00.311 region:rollup2
FOR OF POISONS I'M NOT SURE IF

02:26:58.777 --> 02:27:01.212 region:rollup2
I'M ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS

.

02:27:02.514 --> 02:27:07.852 region:rollup2
PEST CONTROL OPERATORS. RAISED

02:27:04.449 --> 02:27:10.522 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT THE VAGUENESS OF.

02:27:07.852 --> 02:27:12.257 region:rollup2
PETITIONING FOR EXCEPTIONS IN

02:27:10.522 --> 02:27:12.657 region:rollup2
THE CASE OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:27:12.257 --> 02:27:14.392 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:27:12.657 --> 02:27:16.027 region:rollup2
NECESSITIES YES.

02:27:14.392 --> 02:27:17.595 region:rollup2
AND THAT PROVIDES ME WITH AN

02:27:16.027 --> 02:27:18.263 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT OF

02:27:17.595 --> 02:27:21.199 region:rollup2
COURSE WE WILL.

02:27:18.263 --> 02:27:22.934 region:rollup2
CONTINUE DISCUSSING GO WITH ALL

THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT PROVISIONS

02:27:22.934 --> 02:27:26.905 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE BILL I THINK THERE

02:27:24.502 --> 02:27:29.040 region:rollup2
ARE SOME PLACES WHERE WE CAN.

02:27:26.905 --> 02:27:31.543 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY FIND SOME LANGUAGE

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:34.012 region:rollup2
THAT TOOK A OF THAT WE CAN ALL

02:27:31.543 --> 02:27:35.413 region:rollup2
LIVE WITH AND IMPROVE THE BILL.

02:27:34.012 --> 02:27:37.749 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY.

02:27:35.413 --> 02:27:39.918 region:rollup2
ó A MEETING TO THE UP AS

AND SO WHAT YOU'RE THINKING

02:28:28.533 --> 02:28:32.170 region:rollup2
ABOUT HERE IS PRIMARILY WHAT

AREAS SO I I I THINK A?

02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:43.782 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS OF INTENSE INTEREST

02:28:41.846 --> 02:28:44.749 region:rollup2
IN. OF FOR EXAMPLE IN MY

02:28:43.782 --> 02:28:46.484 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IN THE SANTA MONICA

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:47.886 region:rollup2
MOUNTAINS.

AND.

02:28:47.886 --> 02:28:51.723 region:rollup2
A AREAS THAT ARE LARGELY

02:28:49.888 --> 02:28:54.425 region:rollup2
SUBURBAN.

02:28:51.723 --> 02:28:55.894 region:rollup2
AT SOME SOME WHAT RURAL.

02:28:54.425 --> 02:28:58.163 region:rollup2
VETERAN OF THE.

02:28:55.894 --> 02:29:00.198 region:rollup2
AT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WERE

02:28:58.163 --> 02:29:02.600 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE ALLOWING FOR AN

02:29:00.198 --> 02:29:04.068 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION FOR AGRICULTURE IS

02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:05.670 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ALSO OF. A

02:29:04.068 --> 02:29:08.139 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS IN THE SENSE THAT

02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:10.141 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH PAST

02:29:08.139 --> 02:29:11.443 region:rollup2
ISSUES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME

02:29:10.141 --> 02:29:13.678 region:rollup2
THERE ALSO GROWING FOOD

02:29:11.443 --> 02:29:14.913 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE NEED O KEEP FOOD

02:29:13.678 --> 02:29:17.115 region:rollup2
SEPARATE FROM. POISONS.

02:29:14.913 --> 02:29:19.517 region:rollup2
AND REDUCING THE USE JUST A

02:29:17.115 --> 02:29:22.420 region:rollup2
STATE OF OUR REDUCING THEIR

02:29:19.517 --> 02:29:24.522 region:rollup2
DEPENDENCE ON FERTILIZERS UP AND

02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:26.357 region:rollup2
MOVING TOWARDS IN MANY CASES

02:29:24.522 --> 02:29:29.360 region:rollup2
NATURAL ALTERNATIVES THIS IS

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:30.428 region:rollup2
REALLY A CONTINUATION. OF THAT

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:32.330 region:rollup2
SAME REFOCUS.

02:29:30.428 --> 02:29:35.533 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU.

02:29:41.339 --> 02:29:45.043 region:rollup2
USED.

02:29:43.041 --> 02:29:46.110 region:rollup2

GUESS IF YOU'LL ARE PAID FOR

02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:50.315 region:rollup2
THESE RODENTS BECAUSE.

02:29:47.979 --> 02:29:52.050 region:rollup2
IT'S.

02:29:50.315 --> 02:29:54.352 region:rollup2
IT'S DEADLY FRANKLY F. IF A

02:29:52.050 --> 02:29:56.254 region:rollup2
CHILD GETS A HOLD OF IT OR.

02:29:54.352 --> 02:29:57.889 region:rollup2
THE NEIGHBORHOOD DOG OR CAT

02:29:56.254 --> 02:30:00.225 region:rollup2
MEAN I GET IT I DO UNDERSTAND I

02:29:57.889 --> 02:30:02.460 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ANY IN MY HOME AND

02:30:00.225 --> 02:30:04.462 region:rollup2
OUR HOME BACKS. TO A VAST CANYON

02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:05.663 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LOTS OF CRITTERS BACK

02:30:04.462 --> 02:30:07.265 region:rollup2
THERE AND THEY'RE ALWAYS RUN

02:30:05.663 --> 02:30:08.800 region:rollup2
INTO MY BACKYARD.

02:30:07.265 --> 02:30:11.469 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT TYPE OF

02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:11.669 region:rollup2
OF BAIT IN MY HOME MY THERE WE

02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:12.537 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:13.771 region:rollup2
SOME.

02:30:12.537 --> 02:30:14.873 region:rollup2
LITTLE GLUE TRAPS AND THINGS

02:30:13.771 --> 02:30:17.909 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT BUT IT IS A PROBLEM

02:30:14.873 --> 02:30:19.444 region:rollup2
FOR FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WERE. YOU

02:30:17.909 --> 02:30:20.111 region:rollup2
KNOW IN THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT

02:30:19.444 --> 02:30:21.913 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE HOME BACK JUST THAT

02:30:20.111 --> 02:30:23.481 region:rollup2
SORT OF THING AND WHEN WE HAVE

02:30:21.913 --> 02:30:25.717 region:rollup2
SPOKEN WITH OUR PEST CONTROL

02:30:23.481 --> 02:30:27.118 region:rollup2
COMPANY. THE THE COST DIFFERENCE

02:30:25.717 --> 02:30:30.188 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

02:30:27.118 --> 02:30:31.456 region:rollup2
USING THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF

02:30:30.188 --> 02:30:32.657 region:rollup2
GETTING RID OF WRITERS AND AS

02:30:31.456 --> 02:30:34.459 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO THE NEWER METHODS

02:30:32.657 --> 02:30:35.560 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN DEVICE LIKE THE

02:30:34.459 --> 02:30:37.929 region:rollup2
TRAPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IS

02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:40.131 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AND FOR MANY PEOPLE

02:30:37.929 --> 02:30:42.033 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO.

02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:43.401 region:rollup2
AFFORD THAT.

02:30:42.033 --> 02:30:45.303 region:rollup2
I AND I HAVE SOME CONCERNS OF

02:30:43.401 --> 02:30:47.338 region:rollup2
THAT JUST MIGHT NOT BE FEASIBLE

02:30:45.303 --> 02:30:48.606 region:rollup2
IN SOME SITUATIONS I'M NOT

02:30:47.338 --> 02:30:49.908 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY IN A RESIDENTIAL

02:30:48.606 --> 02:30:51.809 region:rollup2
AREA BUT IN SOME OTHER

02:30:49.908 --> 02:30:53.311 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL AREAS WHERE. IT JUST

02:30:51.809 --> 02:30:55.246 region:rollup2
WON'T WORK I THINK MOST PEOPLE

02:30:53.311 --> 02:30:56.714 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THEY WANT THE QUICKEST

02:30:55.246 --> 02:30:58.249 region:rollup2
AND CHEAPEST WAY TO SOLVE THE

02:30:56.714 --> 02:31:00.184 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND IF THAT'S.

02:30:58.249 --> 02:31:01.686 region:rollup2
IS SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU

02:31:00.184 --> 02:31:03.388 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED THEY'LL THEY'LL DO

02:31:01.686 --> 02:31:04.722 region:rollup2
THAT BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S THAT'S

02:31:03.388 --> 02:31:08.426 region:rollup2
NOT THE CASE.

02:31:04.722 --> 02:31:09.994 region:rollup2
AND AND I I HAVE TO AGREE THAT

02:31:08.426 --> 02:31:12.330 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED

02:31:09.994 --> 02:31:14.365 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ROLE THAT WILL BE

02:31:12.330 --> 02:31:14.899 region:rollup2
CHANGING NOW IN IN YOU KNOW

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:16.434 region:rollup2
WHO'S GOING TO DECIDE WHEN

02:31:14.899 --> 02:31:16.701 region:rollup2
THESE.

02:31:16.434 --> 02:31:18.069 region:rollup2
TYPES OF.

02:31:16.701 --> 02:31:19.871 region:rollup2
.

02:31:18.069 --> 02:31:22.574 region:rollup2
RODENTICIDE CAN BE USED IN WHEN

02:31:19.871 --> 02:31:24.108 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T IS I THINK CONCERNING

02:31:22.574 --> 02:31:25.376 region:rollup2
FOR IT FOR GOOD REASON I'M SURE

02:31:24.108 --> 02:31:27.111 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT TOO IN

02:31:25.376 --> 02:31:28.913 region:rollup2
IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.

02:31:27.111 --> 02:31:29.914 region:rollup2
ESTO I.

02:31:28.913 --> 02:31:32.483 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE REASONS.

02:31:29.914 --> 02:31:34.519 region:rollup2
THOUGH I'M WITH YOU IN CONCEPT

02:31:32.483 --> 02:31:36.354 region:rollup2
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

02:31:34.519 --> 02:31:37.855 region:rollup2
IT SAY THAT PERHAPS AS YOU GO IF

02:31:36.354 --> 02:31:39.691 region:rollup2
YOU GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

02:31:37.855 --> 02:31:41.025 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE SOME CHANGES AND I

02:31:39.691 --> 02:31:41.559 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT BUT

02:31:41.025 --> 02:31:42.660 region:rollup2
I AM I DO APPRECIATE YOUR

02:31:41.559 --> 02:31:44.162 region:rollup2
EFFORTS.

02:31:44.162 --> 02:31:47.799 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AND TOOK I WOULD JUST TO

02:31:46.431 --> 02:31:49.033 region:rollup2
ADD AND I THINK YOU ACTUALLY

02:31:47.799 --> 02:31:51.135 region:rollup2
TOUCHED ON THIS BUT YOU SAID.

02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:56.240 region:rollup2
INITIALLY IN YOUR REMARKS AND I

02:31:54.405 --> 02:31:59.077 region:rollup2
THINK PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR

02:31:56.240 --> 02:32:00.945 region:rollup2
QUICK AND EXPENSIVE.

02:31:59.077 --> 02:32:01.946 region:rollup2
BUT SAFE.

02:32:00.945 --> 02:32:04.682 region:rollup2
ALL RIGHT. UP ARE THERE ANY

02:32:01.946 --> 02:32:06.985 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS.

02:32:04.682 --> 02:32:08.886 region:rollup2
.

02:32:06.985 --> 02:32:11.055 region:rollup2
YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I

02:32:08.886 --> 02:32:11.522 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT.

02:32:11.055 --> 02:32:27.138 region:rollup2
ALL RIGHT.

02:32:11.522 --> 02:32:29.640 region:rollup2
IF YOU COULD GIVE ME ONE MINUTE.

02:32:27.138 --> 02:32:31.743 region:rollup2
I'M OF THE BILL ALRIGHT.

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:32.910 region:rollup2
MANY NEW BY MISS FRIEDMAN SECOND

02:32:31.743 --> 02:32:33.678 region:rollup2
BY MISTER MURATSUCHI.

02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:35.880 region:rollup2
.

02:32:33.678 --> 02:32:38.349 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE I

02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:39.917 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM THE LOCAL AGENCIES.

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:42.053 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:32:39.917 --> 02:32:43.054 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AND AYE I KNOW THE

02:32:42.053 --> 02:32:43.788 region:rollup2
AUTHOR WILL WORK WITH THEM ON

02:32:43.054 --> 02:32:45.657 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S.

02:32:43.788 --> 02:32:47.859 region:rollup2
AND.

02:32:45.657 --> 02:32:49.894 region:rollup2
YES YOU SEE AND HE HAS AGREED

02:32:47.859 --> 02:32:51.429 region:rollup2
ARE SO AND HE IS GOING TO WORK

02:32:49.894 --> 02:32:53.031 region:rollup2
WITH YOU AS WELL I HAVE GREAT

02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:55.566 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN MOVE

02:32:53.031 --> 02:32:55.900 region:rollup2
AHEAD. US SOMETHING ELSE WAS

02:32:55.566 --> 02:32:57.301 region:rollup2
RAISED IN THE.

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:58.903 region:rollup2
.

02:32:57.301 --> 02:33:00.772 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS WHICH IS THE QUESTION

02:32:58.903 --> 02:33:03.708 region:rollup2
OF.

02:33:00.772 --> 02:33:05.576 region:rollup2
IF YOU REGULATE.

02:33:03.708 --> 02:33:07.812 region:rollup2
THE ANTICOAGULANTS THEN THERE

02:33:05.576 --> 02:33:09.080 region:rollup2
OTHER POISONS OUT THERE.

02:33:07.812 --> 02:33:10.214 region:rollup2
AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:33:09.080 --> 02:33:12.550 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT.

02:33:10.214 --> 02:33:13.017 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU DO WITH THOSE AS WELL

02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:15.286 region:rollup2
AND WORK WITH THE?

02:33:13.017 --> 02:33:17.255 region:rollup2
PEST CONTROL AGENT.

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:19.123 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU WHAT WHAT I WORRY ABOUT

02:33:17.255 --> 02:33:21.025 region:rollup2
IS THAT YOU MAKE IT DIFFICULT

02:33:19.123 --> 02:33:22.560 region:rollup2
USE ONE SUBSTANCE?

02:33:21.025 --> 02:33:25.430 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT BECOMES.

02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:27.598 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FIND SUBSTITUTES.

02:33:25.430 --> 02:33:29.167 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

02:33:27.598 --> 02:33:30.702 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO THINK

02:33:29.167 --> 02:33:32.270 region:rollup2
ABOUT VERY CAREFULLY ISABEL

02:33:30.702 --> 02:33:33.504 region:rollup2
MOVES FORWARD NOW I KNOW YOU

02:33:32.270 --> 02:33:36.641 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:33:33.504 --> 02:33:36.841 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS.

02:33:36.641 --> 02:33:38.443 region:rollup2
JUST.

02:33:36.841 --> 02:33:40.445 region:rollup2
.

02:33:38.443 --> 02:33:42.513 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT NOW.

02:33:40.445 --> 02:33:45.049 region:rollup2
OUR VICE CHAIR AND I UNDERSTAND

02:33:42.513 --> 02:33:47.218 region:rollup2
WHY SHE HAS HER CONCERNS.

02:33:45.049 --> 02:33:49.787 region:rollup2
I WILL SAY OR CAN YOU KNOW THE

02:33:47.218 --> 02:33:52.290 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BIGGEST.

02:33:49.787 --> 02:33:54.692 region:rollup2
PEST CONTROL AREAS I KNOW ABOUT.

02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:57.628 region:rollup2
THEIR IT THEIR APPROACH ENTIRELY

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:59.497 region:rollup2
IS SEAL UP THE HOUSE FIRST.

02:33:57.628 --> 02:34:00.531 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DO THAT.

02:33:59.497 --> 02:34:02.834 region:rollup2
POISONS TRAPS

02:34:00.531 --> 02:34:05.670 region:rollup2
NOTHING WORKS.

02:34:02.834 --> 02:34:07.672 region:rollup2
THEN WHEN YOU SEAL UP THE HOUSE.

02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:09.607 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST AS EASY FRANKLY AND

02:34:07.672 --> 02:34:11.743 region:rollup2
PROBABLY AS CHEAP TO USE TRAPS

02:34:09.607 --> 02:34:12.110 region:rollup2
AS TO USE POISON.

02:34:11.743 --> 02:34:13.845 region:rollup2
AND.

02:34:12.110 --> 02:34:15.379 region:rollup2
IT ONE THING FOR SURE WITH

02:34:13.845 --> 02:34:16.681 region:rollup2
TRAPS AS YOU'D LEAST YOU KNOW

02:34:15.379 --> 02:34:17.782 region:rollup2
WHERE THE ANIMAL IS AND IT

02:34:16.681 --> 02:34:19.083 region:rollup2
DOESN'T END UP ON YOUR WALL

02:34:17.782 --> 02:34:22.053 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE.

02:34:19.083 --> 02:34:23.921 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN WITH I THINK THE.

02:34:22.053 --> 02:34:25.957 region:rollup2
IN OTHER MANY LARGE INSTITUTIONS

02:34:23.921 --> 02:34:28.025 region:rollup2
NOW AND AND THE CITY OF SAN

02:34:25.957 --> 02:34:29.427 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO THAT ARE GOING THIS

02:34:28.025 --> 02:34:31.262 region:rollup2
WAY HOLE COUNTIES AS.

02:34:29.427 --> 02:34:34.132 region:rollup2
.

02:34:31.262 --> 02:34:36.467 region:rollup2
WELL MISS FRIEDMAN SUGGESTED SO

02:34:34.132 --> 02:34:38.102 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT THIS IS FEASIBLE

02:34:36.467 --> 02:34:39.670 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THERE'S MORE WORK

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:41.072 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I'M HOPE.

02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:43.441 region:rollup2
AND WITH THE PEST CONTROL

02:34:41.072 --> 02:34:45.343 region:rollup2
OPERATORS YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO

02:34:43.441 --> 02:34:46.911 region:rollup2
HAVE A JOB I KNOW THAT.

02:34:45.343 --> 02:34:48.579 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S STRAPS OR POISON OR

02:34:46.911 --> 02:34:51.015 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE.

02:34:48.579 --> 02:34:51.449 region:rollup2
ROADS WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US.

02:34:51.015 --> 02:34:54.085 region:rollup2
SO.

02:34:51.449 --> 02:34:55.386 region:rollup2
AGAIN THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE

02:34:54.085 --> 02:34:57.488 region:rollup2

MY NAME IS JAY WESTON I'M HERE

02:46:37.487 --> 02:46:40.190 region:rollup2
TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE PERHAPS

GET A LITTLE CLOSER AND

02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:43.427 region:rollup2
MICROPHONES.

02:46:41.325 --> 02:46:45.362 region:rollup2
THE LAKE HERE TO CONTEND.

02:46:43.427 --> 02:46:46.230 region:rollup2
YOU CAN MOVE THE MICROPHONE

02:46:45.362 --> 02:46:48.198 region:rollup2
TOWARDS YOU THAT'LL MAKE IT A

02:46:46.230 --> 02:46:49.099 region:rollup2
LITTLE EASIER.

02:46:48.198 --> 02:46:50.634 region:rollup2
I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE NORTH

02:46:49.099 --> 02:46:51.301 region:rollup2
AMERICAN FLAME RETARDANT LIGHTS

02:46:50.634 --> 02:46:52.936 region:rollup2
OF THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY

02:46:51.301 --> 02:46:54.838 region:rollup2
COUNCIL IN WE OPPOSE THIS BILL

02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:56.406 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.

02:46:54.838 --> 02:46:57.674 region:rollup2
SOME FIRST AS A POLICY MATTER WE

02:46:56.406 --> 02:46:59.109 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THIS BILL IS OVERLY

02:46:57.674 --> 02:47:01.411 region:rollup2
BROAD AND AND IT'S HARD ANTI

02:46:59.109 --> 02:47:02.513 region:rollup2
INNOVATION. THE DEFINITION OF

02:47:01.411 --> 02:47:03.814 region:rollup2
FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICAL IN THIS

02:47:02.513 --> 02:47:04.982 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD NOT ONLY TO RESTRICT

02:47:03.814 --> 02:47:06.950 region:rollup2
THE USE OF FLAME RETARDANTS

02:47:04.982 --> 02:47:08.352 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET. BUT IT

02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:08.886 region:rollup2
WOULD RESTRICT THE USE OF ANY

02:47:08.352 --> 02:47:09.887 region:rollup2
FRAME WHICH HARDEN IN THE

02:47:08.886 --> 02:47:10.687 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

02:47:09.887 --> 02:47:12.055 region:rollup2
THE BILL WOULD RESTRICT

02:47:10.687 --> 02:47:13.423 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCES THAT HAVE YET TO BE

02:47:12.055 --> 02:47:14.825 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED REGARDLESS OF THEIR

02:47:13.423 --> 02:47:16.360 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. THEIR

02:47:14.825 --> 02:47:17.728 region:rollup2
HAZARD PROPERTIES ANY EXPOSURE

02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:19.563 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

02:47:17.728 --> 02:47:21.665 region:rollup2
YOU COULD DESIGN THE GREENEST

02:47:19.563 --> 02:47:23.033 region:rollup2
MOST SUSTAINABLE MOST COST

02:47:21.665 --> 02:47:24.835 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE FLAME RETARDANT

02:47:23.033 --> 02:47:26.236 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE IMAGINABLE AND THIS

02:47:24.835 --> 02:47:27.938 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT AND NEVER

02:47:26.236 --> 02:47:29.406 region:rollup2
SAW THE LIGHT OF DAY.

02:47:27.938 --> 02:47:30.707 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT MANUFACTURERS

02:47:29.406 --> 02:47:32.042 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST

02:47:30.707 --> 02:47:33.677 region:rollup2
MODERN APPROPRIATE FLAME

02:47:32.042 --> 02:47:35.045 region:rollup2
RETARDANT TECHNOLOGIES IS PART

02:47:33.677 --> 02:47:36.480 region:rollup2
OF THEIR OVERALL FIRE SAFETY

02:47:35.045 --> 02:47:38.282 region:rollup2
TOOL BOX IN THIS BILL WOULD MAKE

02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:39.416 region:rollup2
THAT IMPOSSIBLE.

02:47:38.282 --> 02:47:40.717 region:rollup2
SECONDLY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:47:39.416 --> 02:47:41.952 region:rollup2
BILL IS UNNECESSARY GIVEN THE

02:47:40.717 --> 02:47:42.986 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE

02:47:41.952 --> 02:47:44.488 region:rollup2
CONTROL SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCT

02:47:42.986 --> 02:47:46.189 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

02:47:44.488 --> 02:47:48.058 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES PRODUCT

02:47:46.189 --> 02:47:49.326 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS TO ANALYZE THE USE

02:47:48.058 --> 02:47:51.161 region:rollup2
OF SUBSTANCES IN THEIR PRODUCTS

02:47:49.326 --> 02:47:52.262 region:rollup2
AGAINST POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES.

02:47:51.161 --> 02:47:54.097 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS HAS TO INCLUDE LIFE

02:47:52.262 --> 02:47:55.465 region:rollup2
CYCLE ASSESSMENT WHICH MAKES

02:47:54.097 --> 02:47:57.100 region:rollup2
THEM HAVE TO CONSIDER TRADE OFFS

02:47:55.465 --> 02:47:58.268 region:rollup2
SUCH AS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:59.670 region:rollup2
AIR AND WATER QUALITY IMPACTS

02:47:58.268 --> 02:48:01.371 region:rollup2
PRODUCT FUNCTION PERFORMANCE

02:47:59.670 --> 02:48:04.608 region:rollup2
WASTED END OF LIFE DISPOSAL.

02:48:01.371 --> 02:48:05.909 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH HAZARD AND EXPOSURE.

02:48:04.608 --> 02:48:07.678 region:rollup2
UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM ARE UNDER

02:48:05.909 --> 02:48:09.179 region:rollup2
THAT DTS YOU PROGRAM THE

02:48:07.678 --> 02:48:10.914 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT ALSO HAS BROAD

02:48:09.179 --> 02:48:11.615 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO APPROVE IMPOSE A

02:48:10.914 --> 02:48:13.116 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF RISK MANAGEMENT

02:48:11.615 --> 02:48:14.952 region:rollup2
MEASURES RANGING FROM

02:48:13.116 --> 02:48:17.321 region:rollup2
PROHIBITIONS TO LABELING AND

02:48:14.952 --> 02:48:18.722 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS OTHER OPTIONS THAT THEY

02:48:17.321 --> 02:48:19.890 region:rollup2
SHOULD CAN DENY SO SORRY.

02:48:18.722 --> 02:48:21.758 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT DTS HE

02:48:19.890 --> 02:48:23.260 region:rollup2
IS ACTIVELY CONSIDERING FLAME

02:48:21.758 --> 02:48:24.761 region:rollup2
RETARDANTS UNDER THEIR PROGRAM.

02:48:23.260 --> 02:48:27.030 region:rollup2
IN JULY OF LAST YEAR THEY BEGIN

02:48:24.761 --> 02:48:28.432 region:rollup2
A PROCESS TO EXAMINE THE USE OF

02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:28.966 region:rollup2
TO FLAME RETARDANTS IN

02:48:28.432 --> 02:48:29.900 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S PADDED SLEEPING

02:48:28.966 --> 02:48:31.868 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS.

02:48:29.900 --> 02:48:34.237 region:rollup2
AND IN THEIR RECENT DRAFT TWENTY

02:48:31.868 --> 02:48:36.773 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY WORK PLAN

02:48:34.237 --> 02:48:38.642 region:rollup2
BELA SEVERAL PRODUCTS CATEGORIES

02:48:36.773 --> 02:48:39.209 region:rollup2
AND CHEMICALS THAT THEY MAY BE

02:48:38.642 --> 02:48:40.677 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE USED IN THOSE

02:48:39.209 --> 02:48:41.979 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES SORRY. AND FLAME

02:48:40.677 --> 02:48:43.580 region:rollup2
RETARDANTS ARE AMONG THOSE

02:48:41.979 --> 02:48:45.015 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS SO FLAME RETARDANT

02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:46.583 region:rollup2
SOME PRODUCTS ARE SQUARELY IN

02:48:45.015 --> 02:48:48.385 region:rollup2
DTS SEES FOCUS.

02:48:46.583 --> 02:48:49.586 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY MY LAST POINT.

02:48:48.385 --> 02:48:51.154 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS ALSO UNNECESSARY

02:48:49.586 --> 02:48:52.789 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S FURNITURE

02:48:51.154 --> 02:48:53.724 region:rollup2
LABORING LAW GIVES CONSUMERS THE

02:48:52.789 --> 02:48:55.192 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO CHOOSE FLAME

02:48:53.724 --> 02:48:56.326 region:rollup2
RETARDANTS ARE NOT.

02:48:55.192 --> 02:48:57.594 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE

02:48:56.326 --> 02:48:58.862 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW THAT

02:48:57.594 --> 02:49:00.964 region:rollup2
REQUIRES LABELING ON RESIDENTIAL

02:48:58.862 --> 02:49:03.033 region:rollup2
FURNITURE TO INFORM CONSUMERS OF

02:49:00.964 --> 02:49:05.335 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEIR PURCHASES INCLUDE

02:49:03.033 --> 02:49:07.337 region:rollup2
FLAME RETARDANTS ARE NOT.

02:49:05.335 --> 02:49:09.006 region:rollup2
BOB COMPANIES CAN BE FINED FOR

02:49:07.337 --> 02:49:10.307 region:rollup2
NOT PRODUCED PROVIDING THE

02:49:09.006 --> 02:49:12.075 region:rollup2
CORRECT INFORMATION AND NOT

02:49:10.307 --> 02:49:12.976 region:rollup2
KEEPING THE CORRECT RECORDS WHEN

02:49:12.075 --> 02:49:15.646 region:rollup2
INSPECTORS COME AROUND.

02:49:12.976 --> 02:49:17.614 region:rollup2
.

02:49:15.646 --> 02:49:18.615 region:rollup2
SO JUST IN SUMMARY ON THIS POINT

02:49:17.614 --> 02:49:19.916 region:rollup2
THE FURNITURE LABELING LAWLESS

02:49:18.615 --> 02:49:21.485 region:rollup2
STREETS WHY THIS BILL IS NOT

02:49:19.916 --> 02:49:23.086 region:rollup2
NECESSARY. BECAUSE THE

02:49:21.485 --> 02:49:24.554 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS ART ESTABLISHED A

02:49:23.086 --> 02:49:26.089 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS

02:49:24.554 --> 02:49:27.491 region:rollup2
WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE

02:49:26.089 --> 02:49:28.091 region:rollup2
PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF FLAME

02:49:27.491 --> 02:49:29.426 region:rollup2
RETARDANTS AND MAKE THEIR OWN

02:49:28.091 --> 02:49:31.028 region:rollup2
CHOICE. SO THANK YOU FOR THE

02:49:29.426 --> 02:49:33.563 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE

02:49:31.028 --> 02:49:35.832 region:rollup2

OUR INDUSTRY HAS MOVED AWAY

FROM FLAME RETARDANTS WHETHER

RETARDANTS TO MEET US

02:50:53.944 --> 02:50:55.145 region:rollup2

MATTRESSES INTO THE STATE OF

02:52:14.157 --> 02:52:15.559 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS THE BILL'S

02:52:14.658 --> 02:52:16.626 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY AMEND.

HIS WERE GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON

02:52:16.626 --> 02:52:19.429 region:rollup2
THE DEFINITION.

02:52:18.195 --> 02:52:20.730 region:rollup2
OTHERS PROBABLY NOT TIME RIGHT

02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:21.665 region:rollup2
NOW TO GO INTO DETAIL Y. DID

02:52:20.730 --> 02:52:23.567 region:rollup2
HAVE CONVERSATION WITH THE

AUTHORS OFFICE OF THESE ISSUES

02:52:23.567 --> 02:52:26.937 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE TABLE. BOMB I WILL

02:52:25.135 --> 02:52:28.238 region:rollup2
TELL YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT

02:52:26.937 --> 02:52:29.840 region:rollup2
OUR INDUSTRY STOP USING

02:52:28.238 --> 02:52:31.174 region:rollup2
BROMINATED FIRE RETARDANTS AND

02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:32.642 region:rollup2
OTHER CHEMICAL FIREBIRD FIRE

02:52:31.174 --> 02:52:33.977 region:rollup2
RETARDANTS IN THE FOAM

02:52:32.642 --> 02:52:35.645 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES WERE THE MAIN ENERGY

02:52:33.977 --> 02:52:38.381 region:rollup2
SOURCES. WE STOP USING THOSE

02:52:35.645 --> 02:52:40.217 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO UP AND THE TO THE

02:52:38.381 --> 02:52:41.818 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT WE USED OUT TO

02:52:40.217 --> 02:52:43.153 region:rollup2
KEEP THE PHONE FROM IGNITING.

02:52:41.818 --> 02:52:45.155 region:rollup2
DON'T INVOLVE THE TYPES OF TOP

02:52:43.153 --> 02:52:46.389 region:rollup2
TOXIC MATERIALS THAT WE BELIEVE

02:52:45.155 --> 02:52:48.592 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR IS ZEROING IN ON THIS

02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:49.826 region:rollup2
BILL. SO IN SUMMARY WERE IN

02:52:48.592 --> 02:52:51.795 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THE

02:52:49.826 --> 02:52:53.330 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF FLAME RETARDANT SO

02:52:51.795 --> 02:52:54.631 region:rollup2
BROAD WE WILL BE ABLE TO SELL

02:52:53.330 --> 02:52:56.099 region:rollup2
OUR PRODUCT IN THE ST LOUIS IT'S

02:52:54.631 --> 02:52:59.035 region:rollup2
REFINED. AND WE DON'T USE THE

02:52:56.099 --> 02:53:00.136 region:rollup2
TYPE OF CHEMICALS TO STOP FIRES

02:52:59.035 --> 02:53:02.672 region:rollup2
FROM IGNITING OUR MATTRESSES

02:53:00.136 --> 02:53:04.641 region:rollup2
THAT THE AUTHOR IS TARGETING IN

02:53:02.672 --> 02:53:07.143 region:rollup2
THIS BILL. AND OUT WE WOULD OF

02:53:04.641 --> 02:53:09.412 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON

02:53:07.143 --> 02:53:10.513 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK

02:53:09.412 --> 02:53:12.816 region:rollup2
YOU SIR.

02:53:10.513 --> 02:53:14.184 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT THOUGHT QUESTIONS.

02:53:12.816 --> 02:53:17.721 region:rollup2
MISTER MURSHID TREAT YOU

02:53:14.184 --> 02:53:17.954 region:rollup2
QUESTION. YES YOU ALWAYS GO AND

02:53:17.721 --> 02:53:18.088 region:rollup2
MY MIND.

02:53:17.954 --> 02:53:21.791 region:rollup2
.

02:53:18.088 --> 02:53:24.127 region:rollup2
SO.

02:53:21.791 --> 02:53:27.063 region:rollup2
IT WAS ONE OF HERE EL.

02:53:24.127 --> 02:53:29.099 region:rollup2
INDEED THE POINT MADE ABOUT HER.

02:53:27.063 --> 02:53:30.200 region:rollup2
BANNING ANY.

02:53:29.099 --> 02:53:32.168 region:rollup2
ATTENTIONAL FEATURE.

02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:34.871 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:53:32.168 --> 02:53:36.940 region:rollup2
* INSTEAD.

02:53:34.871 --> 02:53:39.175 region:rollup2
MAYOR MAY NOT BE A TOXIC OR

02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:40.510 region:rollup2
HARMFUL.

02:53:39.175 --> 02:53:42.979 region:rollup2
TWO FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER AND

02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:44.648 region:rollup2
AND JUVENILES.

02:53:42.979 --> 02:53:46.616 region:rollup2
I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION WE

02:53:44.648 --> 02:53:48.885 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ASK IS WHETHER THERE IS

02:53:46.616 --> 02:53:51.388 region:rollup2
ANY RETARDANT THAT'S NECESSARY

02:53:48.885 --> 02:53:54.491 region:rollup2
IN ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. AND

02:53:51.388 --> 02:53:56.860 region:rollup2
THE UNDERSTANDING I HAVE IS THAT

02:53:54.491 --> 02:53:59.996 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO NECESSITY. ON IT IS

02:53:56.860 --> 02:54:02.766 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT TO DRAFT LANGUAGE

02:53:59.996 --> 02:54:04.267 region:rollup2
OF ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T

02:54:02.766 --> 02:54:06.703 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT SOME FUTURE PRODUCT.

02:54:04.267 --> 02:54:08.038 region:rollup2
.

02:54:06.703 --> 02:54:10.140 region:rollup2
AND AS SOON AS WE OPENED THAT

02:54:08.038 --> 02:54:12.809 region:rollup2
DOOR.

02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:15.412 region:rollup2
YOU COULD BE INVITING. OF OUR

02:54:12.809 --> 02:54:16.980 region:rollup2
ANY CHEMICAL CHANGE.

02:54:15.412 --> 02:54:17.914 region:rollup2
THE ARE TO BECOME A NEW PRODUCT

02:54:16.980 --> 02:54:20.617 region:rollup2
RIGHTS IF YOU CHANGE THE

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:23.253 region:rollup2
FORMULATION OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY

02:54:20.617 --> 02:54:26.122 region:rollup2
BEING USED IN LIMITED.

02:54:23.253 --> 02:54:27.123 region:rollup2
OF A PRODUCT'S TODAY BUT IF YOU

02:54:26.122 --> 02:54:29.759 region:rollup2
WERE TO MAKE.

02:54:27.123 --> 02:54:30.126 region:rollup2
A CHEMICAL CHANGE THEN IT

02:54:29.759 --> 02:54:32.329 region:rollup2
BECOMES A NEW.

02:54:30.126 --> 02:54:33.663 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE.

02:54:32.329 --> 02:54:35.198 region:rollup2
OUT SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:54:33.663 --> 02:54:39.803 region:rollup2
DRAFT AROUND THAT I'M WILLING TO

02:54:35.198 --> 02:54:41.838 region:rollup2
TRY AND I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING

02:54:39.803 --> 02:54:42.872 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHAIR IS INTERESTED IN

02:54:41.838 --> 02:54:44.307 region:rollup2
WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT IT. AND I

02:54:42.872 --> 02:54:45.075 region:rollup2
WANT TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN TO A

02:54:44.307 --> 02:54:45.775 region:rollup2
ARRIVING AT SOME LANGUAGE BUT

02:54:45.075 --> 02:54:47.243 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT TO.

02:54:45.775 --> 02:54:53.316 region:rollup2
.

02:54:47.243 --> 02:54:55.151 region:rollup2
A TO FIND A LIE IDEA A A A.

02:54:53.316 --> 02:54:57.087 region:rollup2
AWAY OF A OPENING THE DOOR TO

02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:59.956 region:rollup2
INNOVATION.

02:54:57.087 --> 02:55:02.625 region:rollup2
THAT IS NARROW ENOUGH

02:54:59.956 --> 02:55:04.661 region:rollup2
SAID THAT IT DOESN'T INVITE

02:55:02.625 --> 02:55:06.796 region:rollup2
REFORMULATION THAT WOULD OF WHAT

02:55:04.661 --> 02:55:07.897 region:rollup2
WE KNOW TODAY IT'S TOXIC.

02:55:06.796 --> 02:55:09.466 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:55:07.897 --> 02:55:11.701 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT.

02:55:09.466 --> 02:55:14.004 region:rollup2
OF.

02:55:11.701 --> 02:55:16.172 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DAN.

02:55:14.004 --> 02:55:16.706 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES

02:55:16.172 --> 02:55:19.242 region:rollup2
AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT AND

02:55:16.706 --> 02:55:21.678 region:rollup2
OPPOSE.

02:55:19.242 --> 02:55:23.546 region:rollup2
ARM YOU MAY CLOSE.

02:55:21.678 --> 02:55:24.881 region:rollup2
A OF THERE BUT AND NUMBER OF

02:55:23.546 --> 02:55:27.283 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP UP POINTS RAISED BY

02:55:24.881 --> 02:55:29.986 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION THAT INVOLVE A.

02:55:27.283 --> 02:55:32.789 region:rollup2
ISSUES OF DRAFTING AND REFINING

02:55:29.986 --> 02:55:35.158 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE A A COMMIT TO CONTINUE

02:55:32.789 --> 02:55:39.095 region:rollup2
A SPEAKING TO OPPOSITION ABOUT.

02:55:35.158 --> 02:55:41.331 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY FINDING CA LANGUAGE

02:55:39.095 --> 02:55:42.265 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYONE CAN LIVE WITH.

02:55:41.331 --> 02:55:43.500 region:rollup2
A.

02:55:42.265 --> 02:55:45.602 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY RECALLING

02:55:43.500 --> 02:55:48.438 region:rollup2
PCA CAPTAIN LOW'S.

02:55:45.602 --> 02:55:51.408 region:rollup2
REMARKS BECAUSE AS SHE WAS

02:55:48.438 --> 02:55:54.377 region:rollup2
MAKING HER REMARKS AT FTA A AND

02:55:51.408 --> 02:55:56.513 region:rollup2
IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT WE HAVE.

02:55:54.377 --> 02:55:58.882 region:rollup2
TWO GROUPS THAT WERE PRIMARILY

02:55:56.513 --> 02:56:02.419 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN HERE CHILDREN AND

02:55:58.882 --> 02:56:06.556 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO.

02:56:02.419 --> 02:56:07.290 region:rollup2
A A A TO THESE CHEMICALS UP IN

02:56:06.556 --> 02:56:10.326 region:rollup2
THE CASE OF FIREFIGHTERS.

02:56:07.290 --> 02:56:12.362 region:rollup2
THEY ARE EXPOSED AS CHILDREN.

02:56:10.326 --> 02:56:15.165 region:rollup2
AND AS FIREFIGHTERS SO THEY

02:56:12.362 --> 02:56:17.300 region:rollup2
REALLY EXPERIENCE THIS OF TWICE

02:56:15.165 --> 02:56:17.867 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR

02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:20.537 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:56:17.867 --> 02:56:21.638 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS A VERY REAL ISSUE WE

02:56:20.537 --> 02:56:23.706 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT RESPONSIBLE

02:56:21.638 --> 02:56:26.409 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS ARE NO LONGER

02:56:23.706 --> 02:56:28.211 region:rollup2
USING THESE CHEMICALS. AND IT IS

02:56:26.409 --> 02:56:30.680 region:rollup2
TIME TO END THE USE ENTIRELY IN

02:56:28.211 --> 02:56:32.082 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I ASK

02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:34.984 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR OF THE.

02:56:32.082 --> 02:56:35.585 region:rollup2
OKAY. ARM A COUPLE OF THINGS

02:56:34.984 --> 02:56:36.386 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL FOR THE MATTRESS

02:56:35.585 --> 02:56:39.923 region:rollup2
FOLKS.

02:56:36.386 --> 02:56:40.423 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT IT IS

02:56:39.923 --> 02:56:41.458 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE SPANNING A

02:56:40.423 --> 02:56:43.293 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL.

02:56:41.458 --> 02:56:44.594 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE DATA SHEET AND I

02:56:43.293 --> 02:56:46.763 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT WHAT YOU DO

02:56:44.594 --> 02:56:48.698 region:rollup2
WITH MASTERS HIS WILL EVER BE IN

02:56:46.763 --> 02:56:49.632 region:rollup2
THAT AS A CHEMICAL IN THE DATA

02:56:48.698 --> 02:56:51.067 region:rollup2
SHEET BUT.

02:56:49.632 --> 02:56:52.569 region:rollup2
A WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OF THAT

02:56:51.067 --> 02:56:55.104 region:rollup2
BUT THIS. YOU KNOW THAT WHAT

02:56:52.569 --> 02:56:57.340 region:rollup2
THEIR BANNING ARE CHEMICALS THAT

02:56:55.104 --> 02:56:58.708 region:rollup2
SHOW UP AS FLAVORING TARGETS IN

02:56:57.340 --> 02:56:59.476 region:rollup2
THE DATA SHEET I JUST DON'T

02:56:58.708 --> 02:57:01.478 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

02:56:59.476 --> 02:57:03.146 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT WE SHOULD

02:57:01.478 --> 02:57:04.747 region:rollup2
DEBT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT'S MORE

02:57:03.146 --> 02:57:07.150 region:rollup2
AND JUST MAKE SURE.

02:57:04.747 --> 02:57:09.719 region:rollup2
IN REGARD TO.

02:57:07.150 --> 02:57:11.020 region:rollup2
MEETING FEDERAL STANDARDS AND I

02:57:09.719 --> 02:57:12.322 region:rollup2
GUESS WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT

02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:14.090 region:rollup2
IS THAT FEDERAL STE FIRST WELL

02:57:12.322 --> 02:57:15.124 region:rollup2
TWO THINGS.

02:57:14.090 --> 02:57:17.260 region:rollup2
YOU'RE WORRIED THAT.

02:57:15.124 --> 02:57:18.328 region:rollup2
CHAIRMANSHIPS GO IS NOT

02:57:17.260 --> 02:57:19.796 region:rollup2
ALLOWING.

02:57:18.328 --> 02:57:21.130 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO MEET THE FEDERAL

02:57:19.796 --> 02:57:22.932 region:rollup2
STANDARDS

02:57:21.130 --> 02:57:23.399 region:rollup2
FOR ELECTRONICS

02:57:22.932 --> 02:57:25.268 region:rollup2
AND.

02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:27.737 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT

02:57:25.268 --> 02:57:29.372 region:rollup2
SO THIS SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE

02:57:27.737 --> 02:57:30.640 region:rollup2
IS NOT ON DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME

02:57:29.372 --> 02:57:32.275 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIONS THAT TO THE

02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:34.978 region:rollup2
BILL THAT'S PENDING HERE HAS.%

02:57:32.275 --> 02:57:36.346 region:rollup2
AS OF ELECTRONIC.

02:57:34.978 --> 02:57:38.014 region:rollup2
I'M THERE GONNA REQUIRE PETITION

02:57:36.346 --> 02:57:39.282 region:rollup2
PROCESS SUMMER UNCERTAIN ON

02:57:38.014 --> 02:57:41.351 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US.

02:57:39.282 --> 02:57:43.153 region:rollup2
FIVE SO IF WE COULD MAKE

02:57:41.351 --> 02:57:44.521 region:rollup2
SEPARATE SISTER RETROACTIVELY

02:57:43.153 --> 02:57:46.389 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT OR WE PROVIDED

02:57:44.521 --> 02:57:47.891 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE TO TRY TO TO GET TO THE

02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:49.492 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF HAVING ONE STATEWIDE

02:57:47.891 --> 02:57:50.693 region:rollup2
STANDARD. WHERE THESE TWO

02:57:49.492 --> 02:57:52.495 region:rollup2
PRODUCT CATEGORIES THAT ARE

02:57:50.693 --> 02:57:53.863 region:rollup2
REQUIRED?

02:57:52.495 --> 02:57:55.298 region:rollup2
VIA THE FEDERAL STANDARDS TO

02:57:53.863 --> 02:57:58.201 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME FLAME RETARDANTS

02:57:55.298 --> 02:57:58.801 region:rollup2
CONTENT QATARIS I KNOW.

02:57:58.201 --> 02:58:00.470 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ON THE BAG ISSUE AND

02:57:58.801 --> 02:58:03.273 region:rollup2
OTHERS WE'VE HAD THAT'S KIND OF

02:58:00.470 --> 02:58:04.841 region:rollup2
CONCERN. AND AGAIN I I WOULD

02:58:03.273 --> 02:58:06.442 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR COULD NOT

02:58:04.841 --> 02:58:07.443 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THAT AND THAT WILL

02:58:06.442 --> 02:58:08.745 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NEED TO TALK WITH

02:58:07.443 --> 02:58:10.947 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT I

02:58:08.745 --> 02:58:12.949 region:rollup2
THINK. THE WAY HE HAS DONE HIS

02:58:10.947 --> 02:58:14.617 region:rollup2
BILL IS CORRECT AND HOPEFULLY WE

02:58:12.949 --> 02:58:15.718 region:rollup2
CAN BRING SAN FRANCISCO ALONG IN

02:58:14.617 --> 02:58:18.288 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:58:15.718 --> 02:58:21.724 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO.

02:58:18.288 --> 02:58:23.393 region:rollup2
A FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH.

02:58:21.724 --> 02:58:25.795 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE IS A WAY TO DO IT

02:58:23.393 --> 02:58:27.730 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD INVOLVE THE

02:58:25.795 --> 02:58:31.034 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTERS SAYING.

02:58:27.730 --> 02:58:32.869 region:rollup2
WE NEED SOMETHING THAT IT IF THE

02:58:31.034 --> 02:58:33.436 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS HAVE COME UP.

02:58:32.869 --> 02:58:35.905 region:rollup2
WITH SOMETHING THAT DOES THE

02:58:33.436 --> 02:58:37.006 region:rollup2
JOB.

02:58:35.905 --> 02:58:39.075 region:rollup2
THAT THE FIREFIGHTERS THINK IS

02:58:37.006 --> 02:58:41.044 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:58:39.075 --> 02:58:42.812 region:rollup2
AND THEY COME FORWARD AND SAY WE

02:58:41.044 --> 02:58:45.548 region:rollup2
NEED THIS I THINK THAT IS A

02:58:42.812 --> 02:58:46.282 region:rollup2
REASONABLE WAY TO LOOK AT IT.

02:58:45.548 --> 02:58:47.951 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

02:58:46.282 --> 02:58:49.586 region:rollup2
WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO PROVE

02:58:47.951 --> 02:58:50.787 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S SAFE.

02:58:49.586 --> 02:58:52.188 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN I WOULD ASK THE

02:58:50.787 --> 02:58:54.090 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURES TO PAY FOR THAT

02:58:52.188 --> 02:58:55.725 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:58:54.090 --> 02:58:57.427 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE WAITED

02:58:55.725 --> 02:59:00.396 region:rollup2
TO DRESS THIS THERE COULD BE

02:58:57.427 --> 02:59:02.699 region:rollup2
OTHERS. ARM AND I JUST ASK THAT

02:59:00.396 --> 02:59:05.301 region:rollup2

I DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO.

02:59:20.083 --> 02:59:25.154 region:rollup2
LEAVE THE WAY OPEN BUT NOT IN A

02:59:22.952 --> 02:59:25.722 region:rollup2
WAY THAT POISONS FIREFIGHTERS.

02:59:25.154 --> 02:59:27.256 region:rollup2

02:59:25.722 --> 02:59:29.859 region:rollup2

AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY REQUIRE

03:01:09.392 --> 03:01:11.861 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

03:01:10.226 --> 03:01:14.230 region:rollup2

ENSURE THAT CHILD CARE CENTERS

03:01:18.401 --> 03:01:22.472 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER IS LEAD FREE.

03:01:21.404 --> 03:01:23.840 region:rollup2
THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS ALL

03:01:22.472 --> 03:01:25.374 region:rollup2
LICENSED CHILD DAYCARE

03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:26.809 region:rollup2

LOANS

03:01:26.809 --> 03:01:29.245 region:rollup2

DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS

03:01:29.245 --> 03:01:33.382 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS.

03:01:31.481 --> 03:01:35.284 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER AT MOST CHILDCARE

03:01:33.382 --> 03:01:36.686 region:rollup2
CENTERS IS NOT TESTED FOR LEAD.

03:01:35.284 --> 03:01:39.355 region:rollup2
THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE MANY

03:01:36.686 --> 03:01:41.190 region:rollup2
WATER PIPES FAUCETS AND FIXTURES

03:01:39.355 --> 03:01:42.158 region:rollup2
STILL IN USE CONTAIN LEAD.

03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:43.893 region:rollup2
AND OVER TIME THIS LEAD CAN

03:01:42.158 --> 03:01:45.828 region:rollup2
LEACH

03:01:43.893 --> 03:01:47.397 region:rollup2
INTO THE DRINKING WATER.

03:01:45.828 --> 03:01:49.065 region:rollup2
YET WE KNOW YOUNG CHILDREN ARE

03:01:47.397 --> 03:01:50.733 region:rollup2
THE MOST HARMED BY LEAD BECAUSE

03:01:49.065 --> 03:01:52.869 region:rollup2
THEY ABSORB MUCH.

03:01:50.733 --> 03:01:54.003 region:rollup2
OF THE LEAD THEY INGEST.

03:01:52.869 --> 03:01:55.638 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO MAKE AMERICAN

THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD

03:01:58.708 --> 03:02:03.246 region:rollup2
IN CHILDREN.

03:02:00.777 --> 03:02:05.014 region:rollup2
LEAD IS A SEVERE NEUROTOXIN.

03:02:03.246 --> 03:02:06.082 region:rollup2
EVEN MINUTE AMOUNTS OF LEAD IN

03:02:05.014 --> 03:02:07.550 region:rollup2
THE BODIES OF VERY YOUNG

03:02:06.082 --> 03:02:09.318 region:rollup2
CHILDREN CAUSE HARM TO THEIR

03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:10.553 region:rollup2
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS. AND

03:02:09.318 --> 03:02:12.922 region:rollup2
THIS HARM APPEARS TO BE

03:02:10.553 --> 03:02:13.823 region:rollup2
IRREVERSIBLE.

03:02:12.922 --> 03:02:16.058 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY WILL

03:02:13.823 --> 03:02:18.027 region:rollup2
HELP KEEP YOUNG CHAU YOUNGEST

03:02:16.058 --> 03:02:20.163 region:rollup2
CHILDREN SAVED BY ENSURING THEY

ARE NOT IN JUSTIN LET THROUGH

03:02:20.163 --> 03:02:24.100 region:rollup2

SPONSOR OF THIS BILL.

03:02:40.983 --> 03:02:43.920 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW EXPOSURE JUST AS TO

03:02:42.618 --> 03:02:45.354 region:rollup2
JUST A TINY AMOUNT OF LEAD CAN

03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:47.323 region:rollup2
REDUCE A CHILD'S IQ AND

03:02:45.354 --> 03:02:48.891 region:rollup2
COGNITIVE ABILITIES. AND YOUNG

03:02:47.323 --> 03:02:50.226 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ABSORB FIFTY PERCENT OF

03:02:48.891 --> 03:02:51.027 region:rollup2
THE LEAD THEY INGEST.

03:02:50.226 --> 03:02:52.461 region:rollup2
IF THERE MARK IF THEY'RE

03:02:51.027 --> 03:02:53.563 region:rollup2
MALNOURISHED THEY ABSORB EVEN

03:02:52.461 --> 03:02:55.498 region:rollup2
FASTER

03:02:53.563 --> 03:02:56.132 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THE

03:02:55.498 --> 03:02:57.834 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

03:02:56.132 --> 03:02:59.168 region:rollup2

CHILDCARE.

03:03:04.807 --> 03:03:07.410 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CHILDCARE CENTERS DON'T

03:03:06.175 --> 03:03:09.212 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TEST THEIR DRINKING

03:03:07.410 --> 03:03:11.547 region:rollup2
WATER FOR LEAD WE DON'T REALLY

03:03:09.212 --> 03:03:13.716 region:rollup2
KNOW. IF THERE WATER CONTAINS A

03:03:11.547 --> 03:03:15.751 region:rollup2
NEUROTOXIN BUT TESTING THAT HAS

03:03:13.716 --> 03:03:17.253 region:rollup2
BEEN DONE. INDICATES THAT SOME

03:03:15.751 --> 03:03:18.988 region:rollup2
CENTERS HAVE A PROBLEM.

03:03:17.253 --> 03:03:20.389 region:rollup2

VULNERABLE.

03:04:39.568 --> 03:04:44.740 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOUNGER CHILDREN.

03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:46.709 region:rollup2
APPS ACTUALLY ABSORB MORE LEAD.

03:04:44.740 --> 03:04:48.244 region:rollup2
AND ALL OF THE GROWING BRAINS

03:04:46.709 --> 03:04:50.646 region:rollup2
ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGE.

03:04:48.244 --> 03:04:52.882 region:rollup2
FORMULA FED INFANTS

03:04:50.646 --> 03:04:54.850 region:rollup2
ARE EVEN A GREATER RISK ARE THEY

03:04:52.882 --> 03:04:56.886 region:rollup2
CONSUME THE MOST WATER PER BODY

UP TO FOUR.

03:05:02.124 --> 03:05:06.228 region:rollup2
OF WATER A DAY.

03:05:03.859 --> 03:05:07.830 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT WE DO HAVE A LEAD AND

03:05:06.228 --> 03:05:10.333 region:rollup2

03:05:10.333 --> 03:05:14.470 region:rollup2
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S THE

03:05:12.268 --> 03:05:15.338 region:rollup2
CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE BUILDINGS

03:05:14.470 --> 03:05:17.273 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CAUSING THE

03:05:15.338 --> 03:05:18.441 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION IN THE PROBLEM AND

03:05:17.273 --> 03:05:20.543 region:rollup2
EXPOSURES.

03:05:18.441 --> 03:05:22.712 region:rollup2

WE'RE FINDING THAT FIVE PERCENT

03:05:40.329 --> 03:05:43.132 region:rollup2

OUT BRIEFLY SO.

CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT IN

03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:40.950 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE.

03:07:38.414 --> 03:07:43.486 region:rollup2
.

03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:45.721 region:rollup2
PARENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ARE

03:07:43.486 --> 03:07:46.422 region:rollup2
ASKED

03:07:45.721 --> 03:07:48.157 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE.

03:07:46.422 --> 03:07:49.725 region:rollup2
A BLOOD TEST

03:07:48.157 --> 03:07:51.594 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR CHILD.

03:07:49.725 --> 03:07:52.128 region:rollup2
TO THE.

03:07:51.594 --> 03:07:53.729 region:rollup2
CHILD CARE FACILITIES ARE

03:07:52.128 --> 03:07:55.598 region:rollup2
CRACKED.

03:07:53.729 --> 03:07:58.167 region:rollup2
A FIGURES ON MY UNDERSTANDING IS

03:07:55.598 --> 03:08:00.269 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ASK IF THEIR CHILD

03:07:58.167 --> 03:08:00.803 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TESTED HER. AND IF

03:08:00.269 --> 03:08:02.071 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN TESTED THEN

03:08:00.803 --> 03:08:03.639 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

03:08:02.071 --> 03:08:04.740 region:rollup2
PROVIDING.

03:08:03.639 --> 03:08:06.442 region:rollup2
THE RESULTS OF THAT I DON'T KNOW

03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:08.677 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE.

03:08:06.442 --> 03:08:11.280 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY REQUIRING.

03:08:08.677 --> 03:08:12.381 region:rollup2
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF THE

03:08:11.280 --> 03:08:14.316 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE A QUESTION ASK

03:08:12.381 --> 03:08:16.752 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOUR CHILD. BEEN TESTED

03:08:14.316 --> 03:08:18.053 region:rollup2
FOR BLOOD POURS.

03:08:16.752 --> 03:08:19.688 region:rollup2
OKAY AND THAT EXPLOSION

03:08:18.053 --> 03:08:22.158 region:rollup2
EXPOSURES.

03:08:19.688 --> 03:08:23.092 region:rollup2
SO IF IT'S. I GUESS IF IT'S NOT

03:08:22.158 --> 03:08:25.461 region:rollup2
REQUIRED THEN.

03:08:23.092 --> 03:08:27.863 region:rollup2
.

03:08:25.461 --> 03:08:30.733 region:rollup2
APART BE HARD TO TRACK HER

03:08:27.863 --> 03:08:31.300 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY IF. OR EITHER IF THERE

03:08:30.733 --> 03:08:32.401 region:rollup2
IS A PROBLEM IF THERE ISN'T

03:08:31.300 --> 03:08:34.303 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

03:08:32.401 --> 03:08:36.572 region:rollup2
ITS THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS I

03:08:34.303 --> 03:08:38.307 region:rollup2
THINK. IS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE.

03:08:36.572 --> 03:08:39.441 region:rollup2
WHICH

03:08:38.307 --> 03:08:42.211 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE HAVING IN IT

03:08:39.441 --> 03:08:43.946 region:rollup2
ELEVATED LEVEL OF LEAD IN THEIR

03:08:42.211 --> 03:08:45.881 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT MAY BE FROM THEIR

03:08:43.946 --> 03:08:47.683 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY IN SO WE WANT THE

03:08:45.881 --> 03:08:49.919 region:rollup2
TESTING TO BE DONE SO WE CAN.

03:08:47.683 --> 03:08:50.853 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY.

03:08:49.919 --> 03:08:52.421 region:rollup2
AND SO IF THEY'RE NOT.

03:08:50.853 --> 03:08:55.157 region:rollup2
.

03:08:52.421 --> 03:08:56.826 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO DO THE TEST THEN I

03:08:55.157 --> 03:08:59.094 region:rollup2
GUESS IT'S HARDER TO.

03:08:56.826 --> 03:09:00.563 region:rollup2
I GUESS FOR ME I FEEL LIKE I

03:08:59.094 --> 03:09:02.131 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IF I COULD BUT I

03:09:00.563 --> 03:09:03.199 region:rollup2
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS AND

03:09:02.131 --> 03:09:05.568 region:rollup2
REASON WHY.

03:09:03.199 --> 03:09:08.737 region:rollup2
THE BILL ALSO CALLS OUT THE.

03:09:05.568 --> 03:09:10.973 region:rollup2
LOWERS LOW INTEREST LOAN THAT'S

03:09:08.737 --> 03:09:13.175 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE IS SO THAT THE. THE

03:09:10.973 --> 03:09:14.443 region:rollup2
OPERATORS COULD ALSO BE RESPOND

03:09:13.175 --> 03:09:17.279 region:rollup2
BOSS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE.

03:09:14.443 --> 03:09:19.348 region:rollup2
FOR ENSURING THAT THERE'S THAT

03:09:17.279 --> 03:09:21.016 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN DO THE REPAIRS IF

03:09:19.348 --> 03:09:22.818 region:rollup2
THERE HAS REPAIRS THAT ARE

03:09:21.016 --> 03:09:24.119 region:rollup2
NECESSARY WHERE THROUGH THE

03:09:22.818 --> 03:09:25.821 region:rollup2
PIPES THE FAUCETS.

03:09:24.119 --> 03:09:27.923 region:rollup2
IF THERE WAS SOME TESTING DONE

03:09:25.821 --> 03:09:30.192 region:rollup2
TO. THE EFFORT STRUCTURE

03:09:27.923 --> 03:09:32.294 region:rollup2
DETERMINED THAT THERE IS LED.

03:09:30.192 --> 03:09:34.763 region:rollup2
IN THE PIPES THAT IT COULD LEADS

03:09:32.294 --> 03:09:36.165 region:rollup2
INTO THE WATER. THEN THERE'S A

03:09:34.763 --> 03:09:38.567 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL.

03:09:36.165 --> 03:09:41.103 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARD WE WILL.

03:09:38.567 --> 03:09:42.404 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW FOR THOSE OF PROVIDERS

03:09:41.103 --> 03:09:43.272 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO. MAKE THE

03:09:42.404 --> 03:09:44.573 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

03:09:43.272 --> 03:09:47.743 region:rollup2
.

03:09:44.573 --> 03:09:50.512 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS.

03:09:47.743 --> 03:09:52.448 region:rollup2
I GUESS I'M I'M.

03:09:50.512 --> 03:09:54.216 region:rollup2
AS A PARENT WHO'S HAD KIDS GO

03:09:52.448 --> 03:09:54.483 region:rollup2
THROUGH NOT DAYCARE BUT

03:09:54.216 --> 03:09:56.685 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOL.

03:09:54.483 --> 03:09:58.487 region:rollup2
.

03:09:56.685 --> 03:10:00.556 region:rollup2
WHY ARE WE NOT JUST?

03:09:58.487 --> 03:10:03.392 region:rollup2
SAYING TO THESE FACILITIES YOU

03:10:00.556 --> 03:10:05.427 region:rollup2
MUST HAVE YOUR WATER TESTED.

03:10:03.392 --> 03:10:06.762 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY YEAR BIANNUALLY RATHER

03:10:05.427 --> 03:10:08.530 region:rollup2
THAN.

03:10:06.762 --> 03:10:12.534 region:rollup2
PUT THE BURDEN ON THE PARENTS.

03:10:08.530 --> 03:10:14.169 region:rollup2
TEST TO MAKE SURE THAT.

03:10:12.534 --> 03:10:15.671 region:rollup2
EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY FUNNY.

03:10:14.169 --> 03:10:17.206 region:rollup2
PLEASE DO.

03:10:15.671 --> 03:10:19.208 region:rollup2
SO THE BILL HAS ESSENTIALLY TWO

03:10:17.206 --> 03:10:21.110 region:rollup2
PARTS ONE IS THE PART THAT

03:10:19.208 --> 03:10:22.711 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THE FACILITIES TO TEST

03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:24.280 region:rollup2
HER WALK WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY.

03:10:22.711 --> 03:10:26.282 region:rollup2
IT'S REQUIRED DSS TO FIGURE TO

03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:27.683 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH A TESTING REQUIREMENT

03:10:26.282 --> 03:10:29.251 region:rollup2
FOR WATER IN THAT CHILD CARE

03:10:27.683 --> 03:10:30.552 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

03:10:29.251 --> 03:10:32.054 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S TO KICK THAT'S TO

03:10:30.552 --> 03:10:33.589 region:rollup2
ENFORCE THE EXISTING.

03:10:32.054 --> 03:10:35.190 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO

03:10:33.589 --> 03:10:36.525 region:rollup2
PROVIDE NON CONTAMINATED WATER

03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:38.193 region:rollup2
TO THE CHILDREN.

03:10:36.525 --> 03:10:40.329 region:rollup2
SEPARATE FROM THAT AND STE AND

03:10:38.193 --> 03:10:41.997 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO WHAT SIX OTHER STATES

03:10:40.329 --> 03:10:43.365 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE AS WELL AS THE CITY OF

03:10:41.997 --> 03:10:45.034 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO.

03:10:43.365 --> 03:10:45.968 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES THE FOR PROVIDERS

03:10:45.034 --> 03:10:47.336 region:rollup2
JUST TO CHECK IN WITH THE

03:10:45.968 --> 03:10:49.138 region:rollup2
PARENTS AND

03:10:47.336 --> 03:10:50.406 region:rollup2
ASK THEM IF THEY'VE GOTTEN.

03:10:49.138 --> 03:10:52.141 region:rollup2
THERE HAD THEIR CHILD BLOOD LET

03:10:50.406 --> 03:10:53.509 region:rollup2
TESTED MANY OF THESE PARENTS

03:10:52.141 --> 03:10:55.377 region:rollup2
OUR PARENTS RIVERS AND ONE CAL

WORKS AND THERE THAT CHILDCARE

03:10:55.377 --> 03:10:58.380 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS SO THEY WOULD BE THEIR

03:10:56.912 --> 03:10:59.715 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IDEALLY.

03:10:58.380 --> 03:11:02.284 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE HAVING THEIR BLOOD

03:10:59.715 --> 03:11:03.385 region:rollup2
LIKE TACITUS AT LEAST UNDER ARM.

03:11:02.284 --> 03:11:05.054 region:rollup2
CURRENT STATUS OF TESTING

03:11:03.385 --> 03:11:07.823 region:rollup2
PRACTICES.

03:11:05.054 --> 03:11:08.991 region:rollup2
SO.

03:11:07.823 --> 03:11:10.359 region:rollup2
WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AND

03:11:08.991 --> 03:11:12.795 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS AGAIN IS PROPOSING TO

03:11:10.359 --> 03:11:14.496 region:rollup2
DO IS TO? HAVE THE PROVIDERS

03:11:12.795 --> 03:11:15.898 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY BE A SORT OF A POINT

03:11:14.496 --> 03:11:16.932 region:rollup2
OF CHECKIN.

03:11:15.898 --> 03:11:17.766 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THAT THE CHILD CAN

03:11:16.932 --> 03:11:19.101 region:rollup2
STILL BE ENROLLED IN THE

03:11:17.766 --> 03:11:21.337 region:rollup2
FACILITY IF THEY HAVEN'T HAD

03:11:19.101 --> 03:11:21.537 region:rollup2
THEIR BLOOD LEAD TESTED AND WHAT

03:11:21.337 --> 03:11:23.839 region:rollup2
AND.

03:11:21.537 --> 03:11:25.607 region:rollup2
IF THEY IF THEY HAVE.

03:11:23.839 --> 03:11:26.809 region:rollup2
THAT'S FINE IF THEY HAVEN'T THAN

03:11:25.607 --> 03:11:29.078 region:rollup2
ALL THE BUILD REQUIRES THE

03:11:26.809 --> 03:11:30.979 region:rollup2
PROVIDER TO DO. IS TO HAND OVER

03:11:29.078 --> 03:11:31.980 region:rollup2

03:11:30.979 --> 03:11:33.916 region:rollup2
PARENTS ABOUT BLOOD BLOOD

03:11:31.980 --> 03:11:34.817 region:rollup2
TESTING SO AT THE END BLOOD LEAD

03:11:33.916 --> 03:11:36.552 region:rollup2
AND SHE'S BEEN LED WRISTS.

03:11:34.817 --> 03:11:39.154 region:rollup2
.

03:11:36.552 --> 03:11:40.756 region:rollup2
SO WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE

03:11:39.154 --> 03:11:42.758 region:rollup2
IS THEY.

03:11:40.756 --> 03:11:45.327 region:rollup2
THE IS THEY COLLECT FROM THE

03:11:42.758 --> 03:11:47.930 region:rollup2
PARENT THEN SOME SORT OF CALM.

03:11:45.327 --> 03:11:50.265 region:rollup2
PROOF PAPER DEMONSTRATING THAT

03:11:47.930 --> 03:11:51.967 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A TEST IF THAT.

03:11:50.265 --> 03:11:53.702 region:rollup2
TAKES PLACE IF THAT HAS HAPPENED

03:11:51.967 --> 03:11:55.637 region:rollup2
ON THIS BILL ITSELF ISN'T

03:11:53.702 --> 03:11:57.740 region:rollup2
REQUIRING THAT RIGHT NOW IS IT

03:11:55.637 --> 03:11:59.308 region:rollup2
REQUIRING THE DOCUMENTATION.

03:11:57.740 --> 03:12:01.010 region:rollup2
JUST SIMPLY THE VERBAL CHECKIN.

03:11:59.308 --> 03:12:02.444 region:rollup2
BUT THERE OTHER STATES HAVE DONE

03:12:01.010 --> 03:12:05.714 region:rollup2
THE DOG REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION

03:12:02.444 --> 03:12:07.182 region:rollup2
AS PART OF IT.

03:12:05.714 --> 03:12:08.650 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT CAME.

03:12:07.182 --> 03:12:11.820 region:rollup2
I MIGHT SAY THAT THE VICE CHAIR

03:12:08.650 --> 03:12:14.056 region:rollup2
WE HAD A VERY LONG HEARING. ON

03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:14.289 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE SHALL ARE KIDS WHO

03:12:14.056 --> 03:12:16.158 region:rollup2
ARE ON.

03:12:14.289 --> 03:12:19.428 region:rollup2
.

03:12:16.158 --> 03:12:21.296 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL A WEEK'S PROGRAM.

03:12:19.428 --> 03:12:23.132 region:rollup2
INFERIOR REQUIRED

TO HAVE THIS TEST DONE ON SOME

03:12:23.132 --> 03:12:26.201 region:rollup2
DO AND SOME DON'T AND WE WERE

03:12:24.533 --> 03:12:27.469 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET OUT. AND AND THE

03:12:26.201 --> 03:12:29.271 region:rollup2
REASON FOR THAT IS THEY

03:12:27.469 --> 03:12:30.372 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY LIVE IN OLDER HOMES

03:12:29.271 --> 03:12:31.807 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF

03:12:30.372 --> 03:12:33.041 region:rollup2
LEAD CONTAMINATION NEED DURING

03:12:31.807 --> 03:12:34.309 region:rollup2
THE PIPES OF THE PAINTER BUT

03:12:33.041 --> 03:12:35.844 region:rollup2

BUT THERE ISN'T.

03:12:35.844 --> 03:12:40.015 region:rollup2
GREAT COMPLIANCE NOW AGAIN ON

PAID FOR.

03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:44.987 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE NOT PUTTING A BURDEN ON

03:12:43.585 --> 03:12:48.824 region:rollup2
THE PARENTS IN THIS IS JUST

03:12:44.987 --> 03:12:50.692 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR A CHECK AND. SO ARM.

03:12:48.824 --> 03:12:50.959 region:rollup2

THEY ARE.

03:12:50.959 --> 03:12:54.630 region:rollup2
.

03:12:52.227 --> 03:12:56.265 region:rollup2
NOT CAPABLE OF PAIN THAT CHANCES

03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:58.167 region:rollup2
ARE THE KIDS ARE ON THE PROGRAM

03:12:56.265 --> 03:12:59.935 region:rollup2

AM IT WITH YOU. AND AND THE AND

03:13:37.272 --> 03:13:40.742 region:rollup2

CONCERNS I'M STILL A LITTLE

03:13:40.742 --> 03:13:43.579 region:rollup2
HESITANT SO MAD AND AND MAYBE

03:13:41.810 --> 03:13:48.050 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE WANTS TO.

03:13:43.579 --> 03:13:48.717 region:rollup2
CHINA MANNER DO JERRY CHINAMEN.

03:13:48.050 --> 03:13:49.218 region:rollup2
NOW BOY HERE OUT OF AND WHAT IS

03:13:48.717 --> 03:13:50.886 region:rollup2
YOUR WHAT IS THE CONCERN

03:13:49.218 --> 03:13:53.889 region:rollup2
EXACTLY.

03:13:50.886 --> 03:13:55.991 region:rollup2
WELL I ALSO AND I DIDN'T RATE IT

03:13:53.889 --> 03:13:56.492 region:rollup2
IT'S.

03:13:55.991 --> 03:13:57.593 region:rollup2
HERE IN MY ANALYSIS ARE

03:13:56.492 --> 03:13:58.427 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND HAS TO DO WITH.

03:13:57.593 --> 03:13:59.394 region:rollup2
.

03:13:58.427 --> 03:14:02.164 region:rollup2
THE STANDARDS THAT ARE BEING

03:13:59.394 --> 03:14:03.799 region:rollup2
SAID IT IS IT THE SAME AS. THE

03:14:02.164 --> 03:14:05.834 region:rollup2
STANDARD FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE

03:14:03.799 --> 03:14:08.036 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE PARTS.

03:14:05.834 --> 03:14:09.004 region:rollup2
A THE PBS WOULD THE PARTS PARTS

03:14:08.036 --> 03:14:11.507 region:rollup2
PER BILLION YET PERSON.

03:14:09.004 --> 03:14:13.575 region:rollup2
IS IT THE SAME STANDARD OF

03:14:11.507 --> 03:14:14.576 region:rollup2
TESTING.

03:14:13.575 --> 03:14:15.177 region:rollup2
UP BECAUSE I WAS UNDER THE

03:14:14.576 --> 03:14:16.378 region:rollup2
IMPRESSION THAT IT'S NOT BUT

03:14:15.177 --> 03:14:18.480 region:rollup2
MAYBE MISSED THE PART OF THE

03:14:16.378 --> 03:14:19.915 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WHERE YOU SAID IT IS.

03:14:18.480 --> 03:14:21.783 region:rollup2
IT IS ACTUALLY WHAT IT'S DOING

03:14:19.915 --> 03:14:24.353 region:rollup2
ITS DIFFERENCE.

03:14:21.783 --> 03:14:26.588 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM THE LEAD TESTING

03:14:24.353 --> 03:14:28.490 region:rollup2
IN SCHOOLS REQUIREMENTS WHERE IT

03:14:26.588 --> 03:14:29.825 region:rollup2
WAS ALL LAID OUT IN THE BILL.

03:14:28.490 --> 03:14:31.293 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS REQUIRING DE

03:14:29.825 --> 03:14:33.061 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IN

03:14:31.293 --> 03:14:34.396 region:rollup2
CONJUNCTION WITH THE WATER BOARD

03:14:33.061 --> 03:14:35.764 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE HOW THE TESTING IS

03:14:34.396 --> 03:14:37.633 region:rollup2
GOING TO TAKE PLACE WHICH

03:14:35.764 --> 03:14:39.368 region:rollup2
INCLUDES THE DEFINITION OF WHAT

03:14:37.633 --> 03:14:41.803 region:rollup2
IS LEAD SAFE.

03:14:39.368 --> 03:14:43.172 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT FOLLOWING FEDERAL

03:14:41.803 --> 03:14:45.474 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES FOR OTHERS LAKE

03:14:43.172 --> 03:14:47.843 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES FOR KEY THROUGH TRIAL

03:14:45.474 --> 03:14:49.645 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT IS WHY. BY IT

03:14:47.843 --> 03:14:52.381 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY JUST WE DECIDED IT

03:14:49.645 --> 03:14:54.116 region:rollup2
WAS BETTER PROP BE BECAUSE.

03:14:52.381 --> 03:14:56.518 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE THE THE QUESTION OF

03:14:54.116 --> 03:14:58.854 region:rollup2
WHAT IS.

03:14:56.518 --> 03:15:02.457 region:rollup2
THIS THIS SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD FOR

03:14:58.854 --> 03:15:04.960 region:rollup2
THE CHILDCARE FACILITIES ISLAM.

03:15:02.457 --> 03:15:05.894 region:rollup2
IT'S SUBJECT TO.

03:15:04.960 --> 03:15:08.797 region:rollup2
THE WATER BOARDS RIGHT

03:15:05.894 --> 03:15:09.698 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT IS THE

03:15:08.797 --> 03:15:11.833 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE SO YOU'RE LEADING

03:15:09.698 --> 03:15:13.101 region:rollup2
EXPERTS DECIDE EXACTLY WE'RE

03:15:11.833 --> 03:15:14.536 region:rollup2
LETTING THE EXPERTS MAKE THAT

03:15:13.101 --> 03:15:16.238 region:rollup2
DECISION AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE IN

03:15:14.536 --> 03:15:18.941 region:rollup2
THERE AND AND. AND THE WATER

03:15:16.238 --> 03:15:20.542 region:rollup2
BOARD IS ACTUALLY. LOOKING AT

03:15:18.941 --> 03:15:22.644 region:rollup2
THE LEAD STANDARD FOR WATER

03:15:20.542 --> 03:15:24.179 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW AND SO WE DON'T WANT

03:15:22.644 --> 03:15:25.781 region:rollup2
TO LEGISLATE THEN. IN THE BILL

03:15:24.179 --> 03:15:26.748 region:rollup2
NAM.

03:15:25.781 --> 03:15:28.684 region:rollup2
AND THINK IT'S JUST BETTER THAT

03:15:26.748 --> 03:15:29.851 region:rollup2
THE REGULAR TO REGULATORS TAKE A

03:15:28.684 --> 03:15:31.153 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT SAID IN THIS REGARD

03:15:29.851 --> 03:15:33.288 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE. YET

03:15:31.153 --> 03:15:35.424 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS OUT BEFORE THE TESTING

03:15:33.288 --> 03:15:36.892 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED.

03:15:35.424 --> 03:15:37.826 region:rollup2
I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD

03:15:36.892 --> 03:15:38.460 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT I JUST WANTED YOU

03:15:37.826 --> 03:15:38.760 region:rollup2
HAVE SINCE I WAS JUST GOING TO

03:15:38.460 --> 03:15:40.896 region:rollup2
SAY THAT.

03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:41.997 region:rollup2
I THINK IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO.

03:15:40.896 --> 03:15:43.432 region:rollup2
.

03:15:41.997 --> 03:15:44.967 region:rollup2
HAVE THE EXPERTS LOOK AT THIS

03:15:43.432 --> 03:15:47.502 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE IS AS I IT

03:15:44.967 --> 03:15:49.571 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED WE ARE FINDING THAT

03:15:47.502 --> 03:15:52.507 region:rollup2
LED IS MOST TOXIC TO CHILDREN

03:15:49.571 --> 03:15:54.343 region:rollup2
UNDER SIX AND EVEN MORE TOXIC TO

03:15:52.507 --> 03:15:56.078 region:rollup2
CHILDREN UNDER TWO. UM AND

03:15:54.343 --> 03:15:57.546 region:rollup2
INFANTS AND BABIES BECAUSE THEY

03:15:56.078 --> 03:15:59.381 region:rollup2
ARE CONSUMING MORE WATER AND

03:15:57.546 --> 03:16:00.582 region:rollup2
OBSERVED AND ABSORBING MORE LEAD

03:15:59.381 --> 03:16:03.418 region:rollup2
SO THERE MAY BE AN AGE

03:16:00.582 --> 03:16:04.653 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL. THE EXPERTS WOULD

03:16:03.418 --> 03:16:06.722 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT.

03:16:04.653 --> 03:16:08.890 region:rollup2
FOR.

03:16:06.722 --> 03:16:10.659 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK WE'VE PRETTY WELL

03:16:08.890 --> 03:16:11.693 region:rollup2
DEFINED AT I DON'T KNOW IF.

03:16:10.659 --> 03:16:13.862 region:rollup2
THE VICE CHAIR IS.

03:16:11.693 --> 03:16:16.832 region:rollup2
.

03:16:13.862 --> 03:16:18.100 region:rollup2
HAPPY OR NOT BUT.

03:16:16.832 --> 03:16:19.301 region:rollup2
BUT AT LEAST I THINK WE'VE

03:16:18.100 --> 03:16:20.802 region:rollup2
DEFINED ENOUGH FOR YOU NOW OKAY

03:16:19.301 --> 03:16:24.439 region:rollup2
GOOD.

03:16:20.802 --> 03:16:25.040 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT. ARM.

03:16:24.439 --> 03:16:26.041 region:rollup2
SEE YOU HAVE WE HAVE A MOTION

03:16:25.040 --> 03:16:27.809 region:rollup2
YET.

03:16:26.041 --> 03:16:28.810 region:rollup2
YES YES OKAY.

03:16:27.809 --> 03:16:30.112 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT THERE'S BEEN IN MOTION

03:16:28.810 --> 03:16:32.714 region:rollup2
AND A SECOND.

I'D LIKE YOU TO CLOSE.

03:16:32.714 --> 03:16:36.084 region:rollup2
WELL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE

WARNING SYSTEMS. AND IT

03:56:47.727 --> 03:56:50.296 region:rollup2
BASICALLY WOULD.

03:56:48.428 --> 03:56:52.198 region:rollup2
