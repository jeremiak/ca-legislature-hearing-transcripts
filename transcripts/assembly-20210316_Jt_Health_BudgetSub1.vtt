HERE FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE

00:39:01.872 --> 00:39:03.074
OUTCOMES THAT WE WERE LOOKING

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.642
AT ARE FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:06.377
INLET TORY CHAIR EDIE VISITS

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:07.845

DOES MEASURES OF WELL BEDDED

00:39:17.788 --> 00:39:19.557
MEASURES THAT REALLY ALLOW US

00:39:19.623 --> 00:39:20.324
TO TEST SOME OF THE

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:21.792
EFFECTIVENESS OF SOME OF THESE

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:24.161
TYPES OF SERVICES. BUT WE ALSO

00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:25.029
LOOK AT THINGS LIKE JUMPER

CITIZENS THEM AS WELL AS THE

BUT PUTTING A PIN THIS FOR

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:40.077
LATER REALLY LOOKING AT OTHER

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:40.945

INCENTIVIZING SOME MAY BE

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.861
HARDER TO REPORT OUTCOMES SO

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:57.795
THAT WE CAN BUILD THAT

ANALYSES OF CALAMP POSTED ON

WE HAD ONE ON. THE FINANCING OF

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.892

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:03.760
RECENTLY- AT THE END OF LAST

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:04.962
WEEK AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

00:46:05.028 --> 00:46:08.499
WEEK. WE POSTED AT ANALYSIS. OF

00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:10.534
EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS. IN

PROJECTED IMPACT ON SENIORS AND

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:17.341
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND-

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:19.776
WE DO EXPLORE IOS IT IN SOME

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:21.545
DETAIL IN. BOTH OF THOSE TWO

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:26.083
LATTER POSTS. THE BOTTOM LINE.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.285
FOR US WHEN IT COMES TO IOS IS

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:31.221
THAT WE DO. SEE SOME BENEFITS

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:33.423
TO THIS PROPOSAL. HOWEVER WE DO

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.893
ALSO HAVE SOME. QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:37.461
THEIR PROPOSAL STILL AN AD.

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:40.297
FORESEE SOME POTENTIAL ISSUES.

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:43.167
THE BIGGEST OF THOSE ISSUES IS

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:45.269
THAT. BECAUSE IT WILL BE

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:46.370
LARGELY AT THE DISCRETION OF

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:49.206
PLANS WHAT IN LIEU OF SERVICES

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:52.109
THEY WILL OFFER. THE TYPES OF

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:53.410
PLANS THAT THE TYPES OF

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:59.016
BENEFITS THAT ARE. OFFERED.

00:46:59.082 --> 00:46:59.816
MIGHT VARY ACROSS THE STATE.

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.585
ADDITION IT'S- IF THE- CHIU IN.

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:03.921
CERTAIN OF THESE SERVICES. IN

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:06.223
EVERY COUNTY SO FOR EXAMPLE-

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:11.161
THE HOUSING NAVIGATION SERVICES-WHETHER- THERE ARE PROVIDERS IN

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:12.529
EVERY COUNTY THAT CAN ADD UP

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:13.964
PARTNER WITH PLANTS PROVIDE

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:16.166
THOSE SERVICES WHETHER. THE

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:19.436
HOUSING EXISTS TO. NAVIGATE

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:21.905
NAVIGATE MEDIC HOW ENROLLEES

00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:25.642
TO- THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:27.678
MOVING ON TO SOME OF THE

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:30.013
POTENTIAL BENEFITS- THE ONE OF

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.750
THE BIG ONES IS THAT- BY MAKING

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:35.752
THESE INTO MEDICAL SERVICES IT

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.821
IT UNLOCKS A CONSIDERABLE

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:40.257
FEDERAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:42.326
CERTAIN BENEFITS THAT AT. THE

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:43.160
STATE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:45.662
ACCESS FEDERAL FUNDING OR

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:48.532
OTHERWISE- WE ALSO THINK THAT

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:50.234
IT COULD AS A RESULT OF THESE

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.169
SERVICES LEAD TO BENEFICIAL

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:54.071
HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR A MEDIC CAL

00:47:54.137 --> 00:47:56.607
ENROLLEES AND- AFTER THAT- IT

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:59.376
COULD POSSIBLY PREVENT THE NEED

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:01.144
FOR COSTLY- MORE INTENSIVE.

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.746
MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS FURTHER

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:05.282
DOWN THE ROAD- ADDITIONALLY TO

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:07.284
THE EXTENT THAT THIS PROGRAM

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:09.753
WOULD REPRESENT A CONSOLIDATION

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.356
OF. HEALTH HOMES AND A WHOLE

00:48:12.422 --> 00:48:15.292
PERSON CARE. THESE ARE BECAUSE

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:16.893
THESE ARE TO- PRETTY SIMILAR

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.695
PROGRAM SURVEYING OVERLAPPING

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:21.365
POPULATIONS ARE WE DO FEEL THAT

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:23.600
IT MAKES SENSE FROM A MINISTRY

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:25.002
OF PERSPECTIVE AND FROM THE

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.903
PERSPECTIVE OF REDUCING

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.206
FRAGMENTATION. TO CONSOLIDATE

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:33.110
SOME OF THE SERVICES UNDER THE

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:36.680
HELLO WEST. I WAS BANNER. IN A

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.815
TO THE CONCERNS I MENTIONED UP

00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:40.384
FRONT THAT WE DO WE DO HAVE A

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.786
COUPLE OF OTHER ONES I WON IS

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.755
JUST A QUESTION FOR THE

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:46.790
LEGISLATURE TO POSSIBLY

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:49.626
CONSIDER ABOUT THE- UTILIZATION

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:50.994
LIMITS THAT WERE MENTIONED

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:53.063
WHICH IS- DO ALL OF THESE

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.098
UTILIZATION LIMITS FOR THE

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:57.100
RESPECTIVE SERVICES STRIKE THE

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:58.568
RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN FISCAL

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:01.438
PRUDENCE AND ALLOWING THE BUTTE

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.273
BENEFITS TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.343
VERY HIGH NEED BENEFICIARIES.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.779
ANOTHER ANOTHER QUESTION- TO

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:11.348
POTENTIALLY CONSIDER IS HOW

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:14.084
COST EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:15.952
OVERSEEN BY THE STATE. WITHOUT

00:49:16.019 --> 00:49:17.321
SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT AND

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:18.789
ASSURANCE IT IS IT IS AT LEAST

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:22.225
POSSIBLE THAT IOS COULD LEAD TO

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:23.860
INCREASING RATHER THAN

00:49:23.927 --> 00:49:27.464
DECREASING COSTS. ADDITIONALLY

00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:29.900
WITH REGARDS TO THE- THE

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.535
POPULATION CURRENTLY ENROLLED

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:34.538
IN HEALTH HOMES- THE QUESTION

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:35.739
OF WHETHER THERE WILL BE

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:37.507
ADEQUATE CONTINUITY OF CARE

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.476
PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:41.044
EXISTING BENEFICIARIES ARE ARE

00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:44.014
TRANSFERRED INTO SERVICES THAT

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:45.615
CONTINUE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS.

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.584
AND THEN JUST A ALASKA GENERAL

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:50.320
POINT WHICH IS THAT- OVERALL

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:52.622
CALIFORNIA HAS HAS TYPICALLY

00:49:52.689 --> 00:49:55.125
DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB WE FEEL

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:57.828
OF THAT ALLOWING SERVICES TO

00:49:57.894 --> 00:49:59.296
VERY ACROSS THE STATE TO

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:01.732
CONFORM WITH LOCAL NEEDS SAID

00:50:01.798 --> 00:50:04.234
EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY- BUT BUT

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:07.037
IT'S BEEN MORE CHALLENGING TO

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:09.373
BRING IN LESSONS LEARNED FROM.

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:10.907
HOW PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN APPLIED

00:50:10.974 --> 00:50:12.008
DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT PARTS

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:13.877
OF THE STATE AND SO WITH THIS

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:15.345
THIS BRINGS UP THE QUESTION OF

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:18.548
HOW TO HOW TO EVALUATE- I LOS

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:20.484

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.880
NECESSARY EVOLUTION OF MEDIKAL

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:32.381
WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING HERE AND

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:34.517
CAL IMINT AND I WOULD AGREE

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:37.153
WITH THAT ASSESSMENT OVERALL. I

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.454
THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE

01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:40.656
SURE THOUGH IS THAT WE HAVE THE

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.358
PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE NECESSARY

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:43.392
THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:46.195
SERVICES AND SO I WAS HOPING

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:48.130
YOU COULD COMMENT ABOUT- OF

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:50.232
FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND

01:07:50.299 --> 01:07:52.635
OVERLAP HERE WITH I. O. L. O.

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:55.137
S. SERVICES AND IF WE ARE

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:58.107
COORDINATING SERVICES WITH

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:01.110
THOSE AND IF NOT. WHY NOT. SO

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.312
WHAT I WOULD SAY THERE IS- THAT

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:05.114
NGUYEN IN LIEU OF SERVICES

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.349
BEING PROVIDED. THERE WILL HAVE

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:08.651
TO BE COORDINATION WITH A

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.286
VARIETY OF PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:13.022
WE'RE CURRENTLY USING- A

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:15.057
VARIETY OF BRAIDED FUNDING TO

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:17.126
COVER THESE TYPES OF SERVICES

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:19.195
TODAY. ONCE WE ALLOW FOR IT TO

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.530
BE A MEDICAID SERVICE WHETHER

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:22.865
THAT ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT AS

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.934
A BENEFIT. OR THE IN LIEU OF

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.936
SERVICES THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.704
DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:30.606
SERVICES- AND WE SHOULD BE

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:32.308
MAXIMIZING THAT ABILITY TO DRAW

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:33.976
DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS AND PROVIDED

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:35.978
STATEWIDE WHEN POSSIBLE. ON TO

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:38.414
MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- IN

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.149
WHICH CASE THERE MAY BE SOME

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:41.650
FUNDS THAT ARE LOCALLY BEING

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:43.252
PROVIDED THROUGH AN HSA OR

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.620
OTHER MEANS WHICH WOULD THEN BE

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:47.089
FREED UP TO BE. A REALLOCATED

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:49.425
TO OTHER PRIORITIES- AND OR

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.193
THERE MAY NEED TO BE UPGRADING

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.629
OF FUNDING OF SERVICES- IT'S

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:54.930
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE THINK

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.499
COUNTY PARTNERS WILL BE

01:08:56.565 --> 01:08:58.300
CRITICAL PARTNERS AS PROVIDERS

01:08:58.367 --> 01:09:00.336
IN BUT WE ARE. A BUILDING IN

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.438
CALLING- AND SO I WOULD SAY

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:04.540
JUST A LEVERAGES A LOT OF OUR

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:06.108
LESSONS LEARNED FROM ACROSS THE

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.710
STATE WHERE WE HAVE SEEN-

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:09.378
WHETHER ITS PILOTS OR SMALLER

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:11.914
PROGRAMS- AND ELEVATING THAT AT

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:14.316
A LARGER LEVEL- RELYING ON

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:15.885
THOSE WHO ARE EXPERTS TO BE THE

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:18.053
PROVIDER- IN DRY DOWN FEDERAL

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.855
FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT BE

01:09:19.922 --> 01:09:21.657
SUSTAINABLE. OVER A LONGER

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:23.225
PERIOD OF TIME AND NOT SUBJECT

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:24.927
TO LOCAL BUDGETS AND-

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:30.499
ALLOCATIONS- BUT- SUSTAINABLE

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:31.100
ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. AND

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:32.801
WHILE I WITH- DIRECTOR LIGHT

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.236
BORN THAT THIS IS- QUITE

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:37.172
EXCITING. AND INNOVATIVE AND

01:09:37.239 --> 01:09:39.642
FORWARD THINKING I- WILL

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:42.678
CONTINUE TO- PROCESS FORWARD

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.580
FOR PROGRESS. AND WANTED TO

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.181
HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THE PILOT

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:47.783
PROGRAMS THAT HAS SHOWN GREAT

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.653
SUCCESS. IN BOTH BEING COST

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.821
EFFECTIVE AS WELL AS- BEING

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:55.024
HELPFUL FOR PATIENTS IN THE

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:55.791
MEDICALLY TAILORED MEAL

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:57.993
PROGRAMS. TO WALLETS IDENTIFIED

01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.828
AS ONE OF THE AYE A LITTLE LESS

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:01.897
BENEFITS. IT'S CURRENTLY NOT A

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.666
COVERED BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.401
ALLEN WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:06.835
DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE LOOKING

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:09.138
TOWARDS THIS PILOT AS- A

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:13.208
BENEFIT THAT WE CAN- PROVIDE

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.210
STATEWIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:18.147
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- QUESTION

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:19.782
FOR DOCTOR COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:27.323
DR HANS BERGER. YES SIR SO ARE

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:29.558
THERE ARE THERE ANY ARE ANY OF

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.060
THE PROPOSED UTILIZATION

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.796
CONTROLS GOING TO LIMIT THE

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:36.365
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE I. O. S.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:44.039
I. L. O. S. IN OPTIONS. I

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:48.877
WOULD- I THINK THAT BECAUSE YOU

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:52.114
KNOW I THE IOWA SERVICES AT

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.515
LEAST I CAN SPEAK FOR MY COUNTY

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:54.917
IT MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT FOR A

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.685
PLACE LIKE SAN FRANCISCO OR

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.087
PLACES IN THE BAY AREA WHERE

01:10:58.153 --> 01:11:00.356
THE SERVICE AREA IS VERY TIGHT

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.858
AND FAIRLY UNIFORM BUT IN OUR

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:05.461
AREA WE HAVE QUICK BASKET

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:08.664
PRINCES IN- AND EVEN ABILITY TO

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:10.132
DELIVER IT SERVICES AND IT'S

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.201
GOING TO TAKE TIME TO DELIVER

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:14.470
THEM. AND I THINK THAT SOME OF

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:16.372
THE CONTROLS THAT THEY WOULD

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:17.006
HAVE TO BE THROUGHOUT THE

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:19.308
COUNTY ARE GOING TO BE A ARE

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.843
SIGNIFICANTLY DELIVER OUR

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:22.845
LEMONADE ARE BILITY TO DELIVER

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:24.546
AND WHERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.448
NOW AND WITH THE IDEA THAT WE

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:27.416
WOULD BE BUILDING THEM OVER

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:29.985
TIME I ALSO THINK THAT THEY'RE

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.987
GOING THROUGH BECAUSE THEY WILL

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:32.755
THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:34.623
UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:37.526
SERVICE AREA ON THAT HAVING TO

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:39.328
GO THROUGH THE NORMAL-

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:41.130
EDUCATION PROCESS WITH PRE

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:44.500
AUTHORIZATION AND- APPEAL

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.502
RIGHTS AND ALL THAT GOES ALONG

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:47.236
WITH THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE IT

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:49.371
VERY DIFFICULT. FOR US TO BE

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:51.540
ABLE TO TAKE THE POPULATION TO

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:53.342
BE ABLE TO DO OUR BEST WITH THE

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:58.881
LOWEST SERVICES AS WE CONTINUE.

01:11:58.947 --> 01:11:59.648
TO BUILD THE PLANE AS WE FLY IT.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:00.482
WELCOME THAT WOULD BE CHALLENGE

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.151
A LOT OF- BECAUSE OF THE

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:03.585
DIVERSE NATURE I MEAN RIVERSIDE

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:05.354
COUNTY SAN BENITO COUNTY ARE

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:07.022
HUGE COUNTY SO THE IDEA THAT

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:08.891
YOU COULD HAVE. THESE SERVICES

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:11.093
DISPERSED AND EVENLY CROP THAT

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.729
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY IS. GOING

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:14.630
TO WOULD BE A TOUGH TO ATTAIN

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:17.700
SO- APPRECIATE THAT SO WHAT IS

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:20.736
IT WHAT WHAT IN THOSE SERVICES

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:24.473
IS AYE AJP CONSIDERING. WELL I

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.708
CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE ALREADY

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:28.544
DO- WE HAVE AS SMALL HOUSING

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:30.379
PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE HOUSES

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:32.247
OVER TWO HUNDRED OF OUR HIGH

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:34.249
UTILIZED THEIR- HIGH COST TO

01:12:34.316 --> 01:12:37.019
LOOK MEMBERS. THAT IS- WE

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:39.888
PARTNERED WITH RANDY AND- ARE

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:41.223
LOOKING AT OUR OUTCOMES. AND

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:42.524
HEALTHY IN THAT IT HAS BEEN A

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:43.759
COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS THAT

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:44.893
HAS IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.696
CARE. FOR THE MEMBERS IN THAT

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:49.732
PROGRAM- SO WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:52.167
TO CONTINUE ON THAT PROGRAM SO

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:54.503
LOW INCOME HOUSING IS NOT.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:56.438
AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE. AND SO

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:58.407
EVEN JUST THE RESOURCE TO BE

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:00.776
ABLE TO PUT. OUR MEMBERS INTO

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:03.746
SUPPORTED HOUSING IS LIMITED-

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:05.514
WE CURRENTLY HAVE A VERY

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:08.417
ROBUST- PROGRAMS AROUND THAT

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:10.652
NUMBER IF YOU ARE IN- JUST-

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.521
YOU'LL CARE IN DOWN SKILLED

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.189
NURSING FACILITIES. FOR THOSE

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:16.291
THAT QUALIFY WE WORK TO MOVE

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.994
THEM OUT INTO A COMMUNITY

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:22.231
SETTING. LIKE YOU KNOW SIXTEEN

WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:28.804
WHETHER THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:31.707
THAT. WE ARE- STARTING A PILOT

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:33.175
FOR MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.277
THAT- WILL BE STARTING IN THE

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:40.149
NEXT COUPLE. OF MONTHS. AND WE

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:42.551
HAVE- WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE AS

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:45.854
THE- EVERYBODY HAS HARPER

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:47.523
MEDIATION WE'VE ALWAYS THAT OUT

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:49.925
NEED REMEDIATION. AND IN A

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:52.361
SMALL WAY OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:53.428
THESE ARE NOT BEEN-

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:55.531
REIMBURSABLE SERVICES AND SO WE

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.232
HAD TO CHOOSE MEMBERS THAT WE

01:13:57.299 --> 01:13:59.735
REALLY FEEL WERE USING

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:00.936
EMERGENCY ROOM ON A REGULAR

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:03.806
BASIS BECAUSE OF- THAT HIT HOME

01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:04.807
CONDITIONS THAT THEY WERE

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:06.809
LIVING IN AND THAT HAS ALSO

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:09.611
BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. AND SO

01:14:09.678 --> 01:14:11.413
DOES THE SOME OF THE ONES THAT

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.317
WOULD KIND OF COMES. TO MIND AT

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:15.918
THE TOP OF MY HEAD. THANK YOU

THANK OF THANK YOU FOR THE

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:25.761
PRESENTATION- I THINK THE

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.663
PROPOSAL HAS A LOT OF PROMISE

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.198
OF MY STAFF WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:30.566
ABOUT THIS OPTION FOR PER FOR

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.167
YEARS NOW. THE ONE THING I

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:33.535
WANNA MAKE SURE IS THAT WE

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.370
INTEGRATE THE SERVICES THAT

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:36.905
PLAN PROVIDE WHICH- AND THE

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.607
SERVICES OF SOCIAL SERVICES

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.676
PROVIDE. I'M NOT SURE THOSE

01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:42.644
RELATIONSHIPS REALLY EXIST-

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:44.913
MATT AND NOW AT LEAST AT LEAST

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.149
IS NOT IS A PARENT IS IT IS IT

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:49.685
MIGHT BE. BUT HAVING A HEALTH

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:50.819
PLAN INVOLVED IN HOUSING

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:52.588
HOMELESS IS POTENTIALLY A BIG

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.756
CHANGE IN WHAT THEY DO- AS WE

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:57.593
SEE FROM I. H. P. THEY'RE DOING

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:58.694
THAT- THEY'RE DOING THAT NOW

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.229
SO. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IT'S

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:02.097

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ECM

ELIGIBILITY FOR ECM. AND THIS

01:57:30.276 --> 01:57:31.711
IS IN EQUITY AND DISPARITIES

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:33.546
ISSUE NATIONALLY IT IS WELL

THEY DO PLAN TO RELEASE- SORT

OF A BROAD DETAIL ON THIS

02:15:39.464 --> 02:15:40.799
PROPOSAL BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:15:40.866 --> 02:15:42.467
THEIR INTENTION IS FOR THAT NOT

02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:44.302
TO COME OUT UNTIL THE EARLY

02:15:44.369 --> 02:15:46.004
SUMMER AND THIS MAY NOT GIVE

02:15:46.071 --> 02:15:48.039
THE LEGISLATOR ADEQUATE TIME TO

SCRUTINIZE THE DETAILS OF THE

02:15:50.041 --> 02:15:55.780
PROPOSAL PRIOR TO DECIDING. ON

FUNDING RELATED TO INCENTIVE

02:16:00.252 --> 02:16:02.754

02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:04.422
GOVERNOR'S AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY

02:16:04.489 --> 02:16:06.157
THE GOVERNOR'S FUNDING PLAN-

02:16:06.224 --> 02:16:07.926
WOULD HAVE THE FUNDING SUNSET

02:16:07.993 --> 02:16:10.996
AFTER TWO POINT FIVE YEARS- BUT

02:16:11.062 --> 02:16:12.364
WE FIND THIS QUESTIONABLE FOR

02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:14.099
THE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS

02:16:14.165 --> 02:16:15.634
FIRST IT'S THAT MEDICARE

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.569
MANAGED CARE PLANS. ARE FUNDED

02:16:17.636 --> 02:16:28.113
BASED. ON THEIR PRIOR COST

02:16:28.179 --> 02:16:29.014
EXPERIENCE AND SO THE ANSWER

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:30.882
FUND IS ALL TO. YOU ON. AND FOR

02:16:30.949 --> 02:16:32.751
EXAMPLE I LOW WESTERN. WHOSE

02:16:32.817 --> 02:16:33.852
COSTS ARE. THEN MEDICARE

02:16:33.919 --> 02:16:35.453
MANAGED CARE PLAN. LIKE WOULD

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:37.022
INCREASE **** TO COVER THE HIGH

02:16:37.088 --> 02:16:39.024
RIPPLE CALL. THIS IS NOT A- FOR

02:16:39.090 --> 02:16:41.126
IN THE- MULTI YEAR FUNDING PLAN

02:16:41.192 --> 02:16:43.194
UNDER CALLAN. ALTERNATIVELY

02:16:43.261 --> 02:16:44.529
EVEN IF THE FUNDING DOES NOT

02:16:44.596 --> 02:16:45.664
END UP COVERING SUCH

02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:47.432
REIMBURSABLE COSTS THERE COULD

02:16:47.499 --> 02:16:48.800
BE PRESSURE TO RE AUTHORIZE

02:16:48.867 --> 02:16:50.702
THIS FUNDING TO SUSTAIN THE

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:52.637
SERVICES BUT THE INCENTIVE

02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:54.673
PAYMENTS WOULD SUPPORT. WELL

02:16:54.739 --> 02:16:56.341
THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES THAT

02:16:56.408 --> 02:16:58.043
SAVINGS FROM IMPROVED COST

02:16:58.109 --> 02:17:00.312
EFFECTIVENESS OF- THE SERVICES

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:02.213
PROVIDED TO BENEFICIARIES UNDER

02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:04.049
CALLIN COULD SUSTAIN THE

02:17:04.115 --> 02:17:06.618
INFRASTRUCTURE- FOR PROVIDING

02:17:06.685 --> 02:17:09.020
ECM ARE INTENSE CARE MANAGEMENT

02:17:09.087 --> 02:17:11.089
AND LOW SERVICES. WE QUESTION

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:12.257
WHETHER THIS ASSUMPTION IS

02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:14.225
REALISTIC PARTICULARLY IN THE

02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:16.194
SHORT TERM AS SUCH SAVINGS

02:17:16.261 --> 02:17:17.429
COULD TAKE MANY YEARS TO

02:17:17.495 --> 02:17:19.631
MATERIALIZE. SO IN SOME WE DO

02:17:19.698 --> 02:17:21.733
HAVE- QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:24.469
LACK OF DETAIL ON THIS PROPOSAL

02:17:24.536 --> 02:17:25.937

QUESTIONS THAT WE RAISED IN A

02:17:32.077 --> 02:17:34.879
PREVIOUS ANALYSIS RELATED TO-

02:17:34.946 --> 02:17:35.880
THE LACK OF DETAIL ON THE

02:17:35.947 --> 02:17:37.382
SHARED RISK SHARE SAVINGS

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:39.117

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:41.186
THEM I WOULD BE LOOKING FOR

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:42.621
MORE DETAIL BEFORE WE CAN

02:17:42.687 --> 02:17:44.589
ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:46.091

INCENTIVIZE FOUNDATIONAL

02:18:13.618 --> 02:18:14.452
ILLUSTRATED BY MY EARLIER

COMMENTS A LOT OF TIME AND

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:18.056
RESOURCES WILL BE REQUIRED TO

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:19.391
DEVELOP AND EXPAND THE

02:18:19.457 --> 02:18:21.459
INFRASTRUCTURE. GIVEN THE

02:18:21.526 --> 02:18:23.528

02:18:25.196 --> 02:18:27.198
EXTENSIVE WORK NEEDED TO BUILD

02:18:27.265 --> 02:18:29.100

ALLOW US THE FLEXIBILITY TO

WE ARE SETTING UP THE PROGRAM

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:48.687
FOR THE GREATER POSSIBILITY OF

02:18:48.753 --> 02:18:51.456
SIX THAT. WE BELIEVE THE

02:18:51.523 --> 02:18:53.391
INCENTIVE PROGRAM SHOULD BOTH

MAINTAIN AND EXPAND EXISTING

INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE IT DOES

02:19:00.065 --> 02:19:01.199
NOT CURRENTLY EXIST. THIS

02:19:01.266 --> 02:19:04.402
TYPICALLY. FIRST INCENTIVE

DO NOT HAVE ONE SO BRING CENTER

02:19:25.256 --> 02:19:26.925

THESE SERVICES ARE OFFERED ON A

BE DONE BY LOOKING AT THE END.

02:20:18.576 --> 02:20:20.044

ANALYSIS AND CAPACITY BUILDING

02:24:17.315 --> 02:24:19.317
BUT WAS HOPING YOU COULD EXPAND

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:21.452
ABOUT WHAT SPECIFICALLY THAT

02:24:21.519 --> 02:24:24.522

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:57.308
OF THOSE EQUITY GAPS WOULD BE A

02:26:57.375 --> 02:26:59.343
CRITICAL OF PEACE AS WE'RE

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:00.511

POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT

02:44:48.144 --> 02:44:50.947
AND- WE SUGGEST THAT THE STATE

INVESTMENTS IN BASIC CARE

02:44:59.322 --> 02:45:00.223
COORDINATION BECAUSE THAT

02:45:00.290 --> 02:45:01.424
INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY DOESN'T

IN ATTENTION UNLESS PAYMENT

02:45:15.338 --> 02:45:16.072
REFORMS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY

02:45:16.139 --> 02:45:17.641
UNDERTAKEN AND THERE'S A

02:45:17.707 --> 02:45:19.576
MEANINGFUL COMMITMENT BY THE

02:45:19.643 --> 02:45:21.177
STATE THE WHOLE PLANS ACCOUNT.

02:45:21.244 --> 02:45:23.280
SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO-

02:45:23.346 --> 02:45:24.147
WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED ALREADY IN

02:45:24.214 --> 02:45:26.116
CALTRAIN IT'S NOT BEEN MADE

02:45:26.182 --> 02:45:28.685
CLEAR HOW. THE CALEDON COAL

02:45:28.752 --> 02:45:29.886

HEALTH MANAGEMENT APPROACHES

02:45:32.122 --> 02:45:34.257
LIKE TO ST PAUL HOW- SO MY

02:45:34.324 --> 02:45:35.358
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE

02:45:35.425 --> 02:45:36.760
STATE BE MORE TRANSPARENT IN

02:45:36.826 --> 02:45:38.261

02:45:38.328 --> 02:45:39.229
BUILT IN TIME ONCE FOR

02:45:39.296 --> 02:45:40.730
STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND

02:45:40.797 --> 02:45:41.698
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

02:45:41.765 --> 02:45:44.067
REPUTATION. I'D ALSO RECOMMEND

02:45:44.134 --> 02:45:45.769
THAT THE STATE TAKES STEPS TO

02:45:45.835 --> 02:45:47.437
PROTECT THE FOUNDATIONAL PSTG

02:45:47.504 --> 02:45:49.239
GUARANTEE THAT KIDS IN MEDICAL

NECESSARY SERVICES AVAILABLE.

02:45:53.410 --> 02:45:53.977
AND THIS SHOULD BE DONE

02:45:54.044 --> 02:45:55.312
CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL

02:45:55.378 --> 02:45:57.947
DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND CONTRACTS

02:45:58.014 --> 02:45:59.616
AND GUIDANCE. AND FINALLY WE

02:45:59.683 --> 02:46:00.650
HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE

02:46:00.717 --> 02:46:02.018
POTENTIAL INEQUITIES THAT COULD

02:46:02.085 --> 02:46:03.253
RESULT FROM THE WILD VARIATION

02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:05.155
AND FLEXIBILITY. GIVEN TO HELP

02:46:05.221 --> 02:46:07.123
INSTEAD OF BUYING NEW VALUE

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:09.459
RATE RISK. ARTERIAS DIFFERENT

02:46:09.526 --> 02:46:10.827
PLAN CHOICES COULD RESULT IN

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:12.595
VERY DIFFERENT BENEFITS WERE

02:46:12.662 --> 02:46:14.431
SIMILARLY SITUATED CHILDREN

02:46:14.497 --> 02:46:16.599

COMPOUNDING AND EXACERBATING

02:46:17.233 --> 02:46:18.902
INEQUITIES. SO IN CLOSING I

02:46:18.968 --> 02:46:20.437
WOULD JUST OFFERED AT THE STATE

02:46:20.503 --> 02:46:22.105

02:55:31.754 --> 02:55:33.456
THINK ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE

02:55:33.522 --> 02:55:35.324
WILL BE VERY FOCUSED ON AS

02:55:35.391 --> 02:55:36.325
MENTIONED IN MY OPENING

02:55:36.392 --> 02:55:38.194
COMMENTS. HAS TO DO AROUND FOR

02:55:38.261 --> 02:55:39.962
EXAMPLE IDENTIFYING AND

THE REQUIREMENTS IN CAROLINE IS

02:55:44.767 --> 02:55:45.735
GOING TO BE THAT MANAGED CARE

02:55:45.801 --> 02:55:46.903
PLANS AS THEY GATHER THAT

02:55:46.969 --> 02:55:48.571
INFORMATION INCLUDING PROVIDERS

02:55:48.638 --> 02:55:49.639
REPORT THAT UP TO THE

02:55:49.705 --> 02:55:51.440
DEPARTMENT WITH CPT CODES FOR

02:55:51.507 --> 02:55:53.376
EXAMPLE- AND THAT IS REQUIRED

02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:54.110
TO BE INCLUDED IN THE

02:55:54.176 --> 02:55:56.312
RESTAURANT LOCATION DATA- WELL

02:55:56.379 --> 02:55:58.047
I LISTED A FEW EXAMPLES THAT

02:55:58.114 --> 02:55:59.548
WAS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST.

02:55:59.615 --> 02:56:00.950
LIST OF SERVICES AND INCLUDES

02:56:01.017 --> 02:56:02.785
BOTH CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL

02:56:02.852 --> 02:56:04.353
COMPONENTS FOR THAT RESTAURANT

02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:06.455
EDUCATION- THE OTHER THING IS

02:56:06.522 --> 02:56:07.523
THAT WHILE SOME MANAGED CARE

02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:09.525
PLANS MAY DO A RESTAURANT THE

02:56:09.592 --> 02:56:11.861
KITCHEN TODAY- INDOOR

02:56:11.928 --> 02:56:13.162
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IT WOULD

02:56:13.229 --> 02:56:14.931
BE STANDARDIZED STATEWIDE. SO

02:56:14.997 --> 02:56:15.831
THAT IF THE BENEFICIARY

02:56:15.898 --> 02:56:18.734
TRANSITIONS FROM PLAN TO PLAN

02:56:18.801 --> 02:56:21.771
THERE IS A- A SENSE OF.

02:56:21.837 --> 02:56:23.806
UNDERSTANDING IF THAT'S GOING

02:56:23.873 --> 02:56:25.741
TO GO ACROSS THE VARIOUS

02:56:25.808 --> 02:56:27.076
MANAGED CARE PLANS IN REGARDS

02:56:27.143 --> 02:56:30.880
TO- LOW AT MEDIUM RISING HIGH

02:56:30.947 --> 02:56:33.182
OR UNKNOWN RISK- SO THAT'S

02:56:33.249 --> 02:56:35.685
ANOTHER PIECE I WOULD MENTION-

02:56:35.751 --> 02:56:38.854
BEAR. WE ALSO- WELL I AGREE I

02:56:38.921 --> 02:56:40.890
HISTORICALLY WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

02:56:40.957 --> 02:56:42.758
A LARGE NUMBER OF DISPARITIES

02:56:42.825 --> 02:56:44.327
ARE INEQUITIES REPORTED THOSE

02:56:44.393 --> 02:56:46.662
THINGS PUBLICLY- AND REQUIRED

02:56:46.729 --> 02:56:48.130
CERTAIN COMPONENTS WITHIN THE

02:56:48.197 --> 02:56:49.765
POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT

02:56:49.832 --> 02:56:51.000
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

02:56:51.067 --> 02:56:53.235
SERVICES IS. VERY COMMITTED TO

02:56:53.302 --> 02:56:58.174
DEVELOPING BOTH A SHORT. TERM

02:56:58.240 --> 02:56:59.175
AND LONG TERM- AT WITH THE ROAD

02:56:59.241 --> 02:57:00.776
MAP WHERE WE ARE IT'S- GET

02:57:00.843 --> 02:57:02.645
CLOSURE IN BOTH QUALITY METRICS

02:57:02.712 --> 02:57:05.448
AS WELL AS- INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:57:05.514 --> 02:57:07.149
INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF

02:57:07.216 --> 02:57:08.918
DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION

02:57:08.985 --> 02:57:11.887
FOCUSED ON CERTAIN POPULATIONS-

02:57:11.954 --> 02:57:13.589
ESPECIALLY AROUND THE

02:57:13.656 --> 02:57:14.390
POPULATION HEALTH NEEDS

02:57:14.457 --> 02:57:16.192
ASSESSMENT- THAT WE ARE

02:57:16.258 --> 02:57:18.427
REQUIRING- WANTING IN REGARDS

02:57:18.494 --> 02:57:20.162
TO THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRING

02:57:20.229 --> 02:57:22.498
THAT PLANS CLOSELY ENGAGED

02:57:22.565 --> 02:57:23.532
WITH. THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH

02:57:23.599 --> 02:57:25.568
COLLEAGUES. AS WELL AS REALLY

02:57:25.634 --> 02:57:26.969
INCREASING THE COMMUNITY

02:57:27.036 --> 02:57:28.504
ENGAGEMENT AND WORKING WITH

02:57:28.571 --> 02:57:30.539
INDIVIDUALS TO BUILD MODELS

02:57:30.606 --> 02:57:31.574
THAT ARE GOING TO CLOSE THOSE

02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:34.477
EQUITIES. AND GAPS OF CARE OF

02:57:34.543 --> 02:57:35.811
FOR BENEFICIARIES ACROSS THE

02:57:35.878 --> 02:57:38.647
STATE. SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW

02:57:38.714 --> 02:57:40.216
OF THE THINGS THAT THE LIST IS

02:57:40.282 --> 02:57:42.451
ACTUALLY QUITE EXPENSIVE- EVEN

02:57:42.518 --> 02:57:44.286
HAVE STANDARDIZED A TRANSITION

02:57:44.353 --> 02:57:45.788
REQUIREMENTS OF THAT CURRENTLY

02:57:45.855 --> 02:57:47.023
ARE NOT IN OUR MANAGED CARE

02:57:47.089 --> 02:57:49.291
PLAN CONTRACTS TODAY. THE ONE

02:57:49.358 --> 02:57:51.127
THING I WOULD SAY- THAT IS

02:57:51.193 --> 02:57:53.195
CLEAR TO ME IS THAT THE PLAN

02:57:53.262 --> 02:57:55.131
CONTRACT HAS CERTAIN CLEAR

02:57:55.197 --> 02:57:57.299
AREAS WHERE THE LANGUAGE IS. I

02:57:57.366 --> 02:58:01.470
BEG- AND THAT HAS ALLOWED FOR A

02:58:01.537 --> 02:58:03.606
LARGE DIFFERENCE OF PLANT PLAN

02:58:03.672 --> 02:58:04.774
IN REGARDS TO HOW THEY HAVE

02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:06.175
IMPLEMENTED CERTAIN COMPONENTS

02:58:06.242 --> 02:58:07.276
THAT THEY ARE CLEARLY.

02:58:07.343 --> 02:58:09.145
RESPONSIBLE FOR TODAY AND THE

02:58:09.211 --> 02:58:12.281
DEPARTMENT- EXPECTS- REALLY

02:58:12.348 --> 02:58:13.983
TIGHTEN UP ON THOSE

02:58:14.050 --> 02:58:16.552
EXPECTATIONS TO MAKE IT CLEAR-

02:58:16.619 --> 02:58:18.554
CERTAIN MINIMUM CRITERIA OF

02:58:18.621 --> 02:58:20.056
ACTIONS OR RESPONSIBILITIES

02:58:20.122 --> 02:58:21.824
THAT MUST TAKE PLACE IN REGARDS

02:58:21.891 --> 02:58:24.093
TO- THOSE ACTIONS AS WELL AS-

02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:25.327
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE THINK ARE

02:58:25.394 --> 02:58:27.196
CRITICAL TO MOVE. THE NEEDLE IN

02:58:27.263 --> 02:58:29.131
THAT SPACE AND SO- I COULD GO

02:58:29.198 --> 02:58:31.534
ON- BUT- JUST WANTED TO NAME A

02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:34.203
FEW OF THOSE AREAS WHERE WE ARE

02:58:34.270 --> 02:58:35.638
REALLY FOCUSED ON DIFFERENCES

02:58:35.704 --> 02:58:41.410
FROM. WHAT THE PLANS DO TODAY.

02:58:41.477 --> 02:58:43.679
APPRECIATE THAT- AS WE LOOK AT

02:58:43.746 --> 02:58:45.514
A POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT

02:58:45.581 --> 02:58:48.584
PROGRAM- CAN YOU TELL ME HOW

02:58:48.651 --> 02:58:50.453
YOU'RE GOING TO GET DATA WHAT

02:58:50.519 --> 02:58:51.687
DATA YOU'RE YOU MIGHT BE

02:58:51.754 --> 02:58:53.489
REQUIRING AN AND HOW YOU'RE

02:58:53.556 --> 02:58:54.590
GOING TO UTILIZE THAT DATA I

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:56.492
MEAN. WE NEED SOME YET THERE

02:58:56.559 --> 02:58:57.860
NEED TO BE METRICS OBVIOUSLY

02:58:57.927 --> 02:58:59.895
AND THERE'S A LOT TO BE LEARNED

02:58:59.962 --> 02:59:02.465
HERE FROM THIS SO WHAT IS THE

02:59:02.531 --> 02:59:04.366
DATA PART OF THIS GOING TO LOOK

02:59:04.433 --> 02:59:08.070
LIKE AND- WHERE WE'RE AT THE

02:59:08.137 --> 02:59:09.705
REQUIREMENTS TO SUBMIT.

02:59:09.772 --> 02:59:11.006
POPULATION HEALTH DATA SO WE

02:59:11.073 --> 02:59:13.008
UNDERSTAND SO WHAT TO EXPECT

02:59:13.075 --> 02:59:13.609
HAVE SOME METRICS FOR SUCCESS

02:59:13.676 --> 02:59:18.547
HERE. YES SO- I MEAN I THINK IF

02:59:18.614 --> 02:59:19.381
THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT

02:59:19.448 --> 02:59:20.516
COMPONENTS ANYTHING ABOUT THERE

02:59:20.583 --> 02:59:22.485
WE WILL BE REQUIRING PLANTS

02:59:22.551 --> 02:59:25.554
USE- A PRETTY EXTENSIVE LIST OF

02:59:25.621 --> 02:59:27.523
DATA THAT THEY HAVE THEMSELVES.

02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:30.025
AS WELL AS- DATA THAT THE

02:59:30.092 --> 02:59:31.427
DEPARTMENT HAS WHETHER IT'S

02:59:31.494 --> 02:59:34.330
FROM- OUR ENCOUNTER DATA OR

02:59:34.396 --> 02:59:36.065
OTHER DATA THAT WE GET FROM.

02:59:36.132 --> 02:59:37.733
SISTER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE FEED

02:59:37.800 --> 02:59:39.935
TO OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS- IT

02:59:40.002 --> 02:59:41.036
WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SOME OF THAT

02:59:41.103 --> 02:59:42.705
NON CLINICAL DATA THAT WILL ALL

02:59:42.771 --> 02:59:45.574
ROLL UP INTO THE VARIOUS RISK

02:59:45.641 --> 02:59:47.176
CATEGORIES. ON THAT WILL BE

02:59:47.243 --> 02:59:48.777
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

02:59:48.844 --> 02:59:50.646
REPORTED TO US I THINK THE

02:59:50.713 --> 02:59:52.915
OTHER BIG ITEM IS THE SOCIAL

02:59:52.982 --> 02:59:54.750
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH DATA

02:59:54.817 --> 02:59:56.018
BEING REPORTED TO THE

02:59:56.085 --> 02:59:58.020
DEPARTMENT. THAT WILL GREATLY

02:59:58.087 --> 03:00:01.190
ALLOW US TO LOOK AT DATA AND

03:00:01.257 --> 03:00:02.191
SLICE DATA AND LOOK AT

03:00:02.258 --> 03:00:04.126
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BENEFITS AS

03:00:04.193 --> 03:00:06.061
WELL AS- DELIVERY SYSTEM

03:00:06.128 --> 03:00:08.197
CHANGES POLICY PIECES THAT WE

03:00:08.264 --> 03:00:09.632
DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE INSIGHT

03:00:09.698 --> 03:00:12.501
INTO TODAY- IN COLLECTING AND

03:00:12.568 --> 03:00:14.236
USING THAT FOR ANALYTICS I

03:00:14.303 --> 03:00:15.838
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. REALLY

03:00:15.905 --> 03:00:17.873
IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE TO

03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:21.076
BUILD ON THIS POPULATION HEALTH

03:00:21.143 --> 03:00:21.577
MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND

03:00:21.644 --> 03:00:23.746
APPROACH- I THINK THE OTHER

03:00:23.812 --> 03:00:25.548
THING IS THAT- WE'RE GOING TO

03:00:25.614 --> 03:00:27.516
HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW AND WHAT

03:00:27.583 --> 03:00:28.851
MEASURES WE LOOK AT THE CROSS

03:00:28.918 --> 03:00:30.352
OVER ONE OF THE BIG PIECES THAT

03:00:30.419 --> 03:00:31.754
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. WHAT ARE

03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:33.022
THOSE QUALITY METRICS THAT

03:00:33.088 --> 03:00:35.858
CLEARLY OF GO ACROSS OUR

03:00:35.925 --> 03:00:37.293
DELIVERY SYSTEMS WE REALLY WANT

03:00:37.359 --> 03:00:38.594
TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THOSE

03:00:38.661 --> 03:00:40.362
QUALITY METRICS BECAUSE IT

03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:42.131
SHOWS THAT THE MANAGED CARE

03:00:42.198 --> 03:00:43.832
PLANS HAVE PUT IN-

03:00:43.899 --> 03:00:44.967
COMPREHENSIVE CARE

03:00:45.034 --> 03:00:48.437
COORDINATION. REFERRAL OF A

03:00:48.504 --> 03:00:49.338
KIND OF MECHANISMS AND

03:00:49.405 --> 03:00:50.573
REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT

03:00:50.639 --> 03:00:52.341
BENEFICIARIES ARE GETTING LOST

03:00:52.408 --> 03:00:53.876
AS THEY TRANSITION FROM ONE

03:00:53.943 --> 03:00:55.544
DELIVERY SYSTEM TO THE OTHER

03:00:55.611 --> 03:00:56.378
FOR EXAMPLE IS MIKE WAS

03:00:56.445 --> 03:00:57.746
MENTIONING EARLIER ON THE

03:00:57.813 --> 03:00:59.515
DENTAL SERVICES ENSURING THAT

03:00:59.582 --> 03:01:01.483
THOSE GAPS ARE BEING CLOSED IN

03:01:01.550 --> 03:01:02.952
THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING

03:01:03.018 --> 03:01:04.987
ACCESS TO DENTAL SERVICES. SO

03:01:05.054 --> 03:01:05.921
THAT IS WHERE WE WILL BE

03:01:05.988 --> 03:01:08.023
FOCUSING SOME OF OUR EFFORTS IN

03:01:08.090 --> 03:01:09.058
REGARDS TO LOOKING AT

03:01:09.124 --> 03:01:10.526
POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT TO

03:01:10.593 --> 03:01:16.398
ENSURE ONE OUT WERE CLOSING-

03:01:16.465 --> 03:01:17.366
GAPS ACROSS DELIVERY SYSTEMS-

03:01:17.433 --> 03:01:18.534
SURE THAT THOSE. ARE ENTERED.

03:01:18.601 --> 03:01:20.302
IN THE- COURT NEEDED AND THEN

03:01:20.369 --> 03:01:22.037
ASK MENTIONED EARLIER LOOKING

03:01:22.104 --> 03:01:24.206
AT CLOSING THOSE EQUITY GAPS

03:01:24.273 --> 03:01:25.474
AND WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT

03:01:25.541 --> 03:01:27.109
WHAT THAT WOULD BE. I DON'T

03:01:27.176 --> 03:01:28.611
HAVE A LIST FOR YOU TODAY BUT I

03:01:28.677 --> 03:01:30.312
DO KNOW THAT WE PLAN ON FULLY

THE LEGISLATURE. IN REGARDS TO

03:01:33.949 --> 03:01:35.451
WHAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT BERMAN

03:01:35.517 --> 03:01:37.753
EQUITY POINT OF VIEW AND HOW WE

03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:38.721
WILL MEASURE THAT ALL PLANS

03:01:38.787 --> 03:01:40.656
ACCOUNTABLE IN INCENTIVIZE

03:01:40.723 --> 03:01:43.259
THAT- THROUGH VARIOUS

03:01:43.325 --> 03:01:45.594
MECHANISMS. THANK YOU I GUESS I

03:01:45.661 --> 03:01:48.897
ENVISION. DATA COLLECTION. IN A

03:01:48.964 --> 03:01:50.733
VERY VERY BROAD WAY THAT'LL

ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO

ACTUALLY. DO THE RESEARCH

03:01:53.702 --> 03:01:55.938
NECESSARY FOR ENTIRE POPULATION

WILL BE COLLECTED. WILL ALSO BE

03:02:01.777 --> 03:02:02.911
ABLE TO BE COORDINATED WITH

03:02:02.978 --> 03:02:03.879
OTHER DATA THAT'S NOT

03:02:03.946 --> 03:02:05.180
NECESSARILY MEDICARE AS WE

03:02:05.247 --> 03:02:06.248
START LOOKING INDIVIDUAL

03:02:06.315 --> 03:02:08.617
POPULATIONS OUT THERE. AND THE

03:02:08.684 --> 03:02:09.752
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH

03:02:09.818 --> 03:02:11.320

03:02:29.338 --> 03:02:31.240
EXISTING MODELS OF MANAGED CARE

03:02:31.307 --> 03:02:33.242
POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT

03:02:33.309 --> 03:02:34.843
THAT WE WANT THE PLANS TO

03:02:34.910 --> 03:02:38.580
FOLLOW. FOR EXAMPLE DOES KAISER

03:02:38.647 --> 03:02:40.916
AND THEIR COMMERCIAL COVERAGE

03:02:40.983 --> 03:02:44.253
UTILIZED THIS APPROACH.

03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:46.155
INTERESTING QUESTION- SO I

03:02:46.221 --> 03:02:49.558
THINK- YEAH I THINK KAISER IS A

03:02:49.625 --> 03:02:51.126
GREAT EXAMPLE TO BE HONEST WITH

03:02:51.193 --> 03:02:52.695
YOU OF WHERE YOU CAN SEE AN

03:02:52.761 --> 03:02:53.929
EFFECTIVE POPULATION HEALTH

03:02:53.996 --> 03:02:56.799
MANAGEMENT TIED TO- OVER A BEST

03:02:56.865 --> 03:02:58.367
ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD THAT

03:02:58.434 --> 03:02:59.935
REALLY- IT ALLOWS YOU TO

03:03:00.002 --> 03:03:02.638
IDENTIFY. CERTAIN POPULATIONS

AND ENSURE THAT- CARE GAPS ARE

03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:06.575

03:03:06.642 --> 03:03:08.110
OF THE VALUES OF AN INTEGRATED

03:03:08.177 --> 03:03:09.311

03:03:09.378 --> 03:03:11.313
DRIVE TO SOME OF THOSE FACTORS

03:03:11.380 --> 03:03:12.214
I DO STILL THINK THAT THERE

03:03:12.281 --> 03:03:14.917
ARE. OPPORTUNITIES ON THERE OF

03:03:14.983 --> 03:03:17.820

03:03:17.886 --> 03:03:19.021
RESPECTIVE OF SOME OF THEIR

03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:20.222
QUALITY SCORES BEING SOME OF

03:03:20.289 --> 03:03:22.124
THE PAST IN IN MEDICARE LIKE IF

03:03:24.393 --> 03:03:26.128

DEPARTMENT'S FUTURE PROPOSAL

03:36:00.881 --> 03:36:02.849
REGARDING CHANGES OBSERVED

03:36:02.916 --> 03:36:05.218
TODAY IT IS STILL STATUS QUO.

03:36:05.285 --> 03:36:07.254
FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE ON

03:36:07.321 --> 03:36:09.222
THE WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES

03:36:09.289 --> 03:36:10.524
BUT I WOULD NOTATE HERE IS THAT

03:36:10.590 --> 03:36:12.259
THE ENROLLMENT CHANGES ARE

03:36:12.326 --> 03:36:15.829
BUDGET NEUTRAL- ESSENTIALLY NO-

03:36:15.896 --> 03:36:18.065
NEXT COSTS OR SAVINGS OVERALL.

03:36:18.131 --> 03:36:19.833
I'M HOWEVER GIVEN THE FACT THAT

03:36:19.900 --> 03:36:23.103
WE ARE A CASH BASED BUDGET- YOU

03:36:23.170 --> 03:36:26.106
WILL SEE SOME- COSTS SCORED IN

03:36:26.173 --> 03:36:28.041
THE BUDGET- IT TO REFLECT THE

03:36:28.108 --> 03:36:30.010
CHANGE OF POPULATIONS AND

03:36:30.077 --> 03:36:31.044
THAT'S REALLY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE

03:36:31.111 --> 03:36:32.612
TRANSITIONING. POPULATION FROM

03:36:32.679 --> 03:36:34.314
FEE FOR SERVICE TO MANAGE CARE

03:36:34.381 --> 03:36:36.516
FOR EXAMPLE- YOU HAVE TO START

03:36:36.583 --> 03:36:37.818
PAYING THE MANAGED CARE PLAN

03:36:37.884 --> 03:36:39.686
THE CAPITATION RATE UP FOR THAT

03:36:39.753 --> 03:36:42.055
TRANSITION IMMEDIATELY HOWEVER-

03:36:42.122 --> 03:36:45.425
PROVIDER STILL HAVE UP TO THREE

03:36:45.492 --> 03:36:45.992

PROVIDED TO THAT BENEFIT YEAR

03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:52.165
THE YEAR PRIOR TO THAT

03:36:52.232 --> 03:36:54.101
TRANSITION- AND SO WE DO HAVE

03:36:54.167 --> 03:36:55.235
TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE TYPES OF

03:36:55.302 --> 03:37:03.677
TRANSITIONS ON A CASH BASIS- SO

03:37:03.744 --> 03:37:04.177
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THAT

03:37:04.244 --> 03:37:04.745
REFLECTED. WHEN IT COMES TO

03:37:04.811 --> 03:37:07.647
CAUGHT OF CARE OFFERED. OF

03:37:07.714 --> 03:37:09.549

MANAGED CARE PLANS MUST ALLOW

03:37:17.290 --> 03:37:18.759
THIS. EVEN IF THE PROVIDERS

OUTSIDE OF THE MANAGED CARE

03:37:20.260 --> 03:37:22.028
PLANS NETWORK- AS LONG AS THE

PROVIDER IS WILLING TO ACCEPT

03:37:23.697 --> 03:37:25.699
THE PLAN REIMBURSEMENT RATES-

03:37:25.766 --> 03:37:27.534
AND THERE ARE NO QUALITY ISSUES

03:37:27.601 --> 03:37:28.802
THIS IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR

03:37:28.869 --> 03:37:30.137
EXISTING CONTINUITY OF CARE

03:37:30.203 --> 03:37:31.805

THIS COVERAGE IN MANAGED CARE

03:40:24.344 --> 03:40:26.146
COULD CAUSE SOME DISRUPTIONS IN

03:40:26.212 --> 03:40:27.480
THE CARE THEY RECEIVE-

03:40:27.547 --> 03:40:29.015

MAYBE. MAYBE NINETY DAYS AND-

03:40:43.730 --> 03:40:45.565

ONE TO TWO YEARS COULD IT IN

03:40:54.341 --> 03:40:55.976
THAT INITIAL PERIOD. CAUSE THEM

03:40:56.042 --> 03:40:57.777
