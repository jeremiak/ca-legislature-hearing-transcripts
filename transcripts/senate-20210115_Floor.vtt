VIOLENCE BY CREATING A DIALOGUE

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:49.214

STRUGGLE ON THE HIGH PLANE OF

00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:16.561
DIGNITY AND DISCIPLINE. WE MUST

00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:18.630
NOT ALLOW OUR CREATIVE PROTEST

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:20.131
TO DEGENERATE INTO PHYSICAL

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:23.234
VIOLENCE AGAIN AND AGAIN WE

00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:24.569
MUST RISE TO THE MAJESTIC

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:26.304
HEIGHTS OF MEETING PHYSICAL

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:29.707

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:37.115
OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING TO

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:40.018

THE CULT OF AN INDIVIDUAL. DR

00:31:15.406 --> 00:31:17.175
MARTIN LUTHER KING WE STILL

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:18.576
SPEAK ABOUT HIM TODAY NOT

00:31:18.643 --> 00:31:20.545
BECAUSE OF HIS PERSONALITY NOT

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:21.379
BECAUSE OF THE CULT OF HIS

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:23.548
PERSONALITY BUT BECAUSE OF HIS

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:25.483

TARGETS BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:36.261
DIFFERENT IDEAS AND OTHERS FEEL

00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:38.162

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:41.532
ENOUGH. THAT WE ALL REMEMBER.

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:42.834
THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.535
TO DO IS TO CREATE THAT MORE

00:31:44.602 --> 00:31:46.337
PERFECT UNION WHERE WE ARE ALL

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:47.772

MARTIN LUTHER KING AND THE

00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:05.663
BLACK COMMUNITY. I WOULD MAKE

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.399
NOTE THAT MARTIN LUTHER KING-

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:11.502
WAS A MAN WHO- SPOKE WITH MORAL

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:13.237
AUTHORITY HE SPOKE ABOUT FACTS

00:36:13.304 --> 00:36:17.508
AND DO NOT NEED TO DENY. HIM

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:18.943
TALK ABOUT THINGS ON VIOLENTLY.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:24.081
AND T. APPEALED TO THE- GOOD

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:25.750
WELL AND THE MORE AUTHORITY

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.184
THAT HE HOPED THAT EACH ONE OF

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:29.253
US HAD HE BELIEVED IN AMERICA

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.522
AND AMERICANS DESPITE THE FACT

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:33.057
THAT HIS OWN PERSONAL

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:35.760
EXPERIENCE AND THOSE OF HIS

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:37.461
FOLLOWERS- DO NOT NCESSARILY.

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:39.664
INSPIRE SUCH CONFIDENCE BUT HE

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.198
ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT BY

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:43.134
SPEAKING OUT AND ACTING

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.169
NONVIOLENTLY THAT THE OUR

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:46.837
BETTER NATURES WOULD EVENTUALLY

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:50.608
EMERGE AND AT LEAST A MAJORITY

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:51.208
OF AMERICANS WOULD STAND WITH

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:55.880
HIM. AND WELL UNFORTUNATELY-

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:58.382
THOSE WHO OPPOSED HIM- FINALLY

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:01.819
TOOK HIS LIFE. HE HIMSELF HIS

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:04.989
IDEAS REMAIN IMMORTAL. BECAUSE

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:09.427
MMHM BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IN US

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:10.294
AND WE NEED TO BELIEVE IN

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:13.230
OURSELVES NOW AS WE ARE AS I'M

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:15.132
SPEAKING HERE- WE HAVE A CHAIN

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:16.400
LINK FENCE SURROUNDING THE

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:18.636
CAPITAL WE JUST SAW WHAT WE

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.204
WHAT WE JUST WITNESSED ACTS OF

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:22.006
VIOLENCE IN OUR U. S. CAPITOL

00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:24.842
IN DC- THERE ARE THOSE WHO

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:27.244
UNFORTUNATELY- ARE STILL

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:29.413
CALLING FOR VIOLENCE AND I

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:33.951
THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT-

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:36.854
VIOLENCE IS NOT. THE WAY AND

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:38.956
THAT THOSE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL.

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:41.993
WHO NEED TO STAND UP AND SAY

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:43.060
THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE DO

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.729
THINGS AND I THINK MARTIN

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:49.033
LUTHER KING IS A MAN WHO IS A

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.169
EXAMPLE OF THAT AND- HE DID

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:55.239
LOSE HIS LIFE- WE NEED TO TAKE

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:56.941
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT- BUT

00:37:57.008 --> 00:38:00.077
WE ALSO NEED TO CALL ON. ALL TO

00:38:00.144 --> 00:38:03.648
STAND STRONG. AND SPEAK OUT.

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:07.018
AND CONTINUE TO- APPEAL TO THAT

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:08.819
MORAL AUTHORITY THAT MARTIN

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:10.855
LUTHER KING SAID AS AN EXAMPLE

00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:13.391
