ONE SIX MY WITHIN ACTED AT LEAST TWO THINGS WERE MANIFESTLY CLEAR FIRST IT WAS APPARENT THE GROUNDWATER THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO SERIOUS THE DEMONS OF BEER OVER DRAFTING FOR DECADES THE CONSEQUENCES WERE VERGING ON CATASTROPHIC AND GROWING WORSE EXPONENTIALLY DUE pEQUALLY APPARENT THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION TIME WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT A CORRECTIVE APPROACH THAT SIGNAL WAS WRITTEN TO GIVE COMMUNITIES FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS. TO ORGANIZE AND PREPARE A PLAN. BASINS WITH CRITICAL OVER DRAFTING WERE A LOT OF FIVE YEARS TO SUBMIT THEIR PLANS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND THEY HAVE DONE SO. THE BASINS WITH LESS SECURED OVERDRAFT IN DRAFTING WERE GIVEN SEVEN YEARS SEVEN YEARS TO SUBMIT THEIR PLANS. EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY FOUR WOULD OPERATE DECISIONAL TIME TO JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY HAD MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS TO ACT. AND WHICH WILL HAVE THE FULL SEVEN YEARS TO DO SO BY NEXT JANUARY. WELL THERE'S NO DISPUTE THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING MORE DIFFICULT IN THE LAST YEAR. THE PANDEMIC CANNOT BE AN EXCUSE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SO MUCH TIME WITH ROVIDED TO MEET SEGMENTS REQUIREMENTS. THE URGENCY OF ADDRESSING ARE OVER DRAFTING OF GROUNDWATER HAS NOT DIMINISHED BUT HAS ONLY GROWN SINCE THE PASSAGE OF STIGMA. INDEED WITH THE SNOW PACK 40% BELOW AVERAGE THIS YEAR FOLLOWING A NOTHER FAR BELOW AVERAGE SEASON LAST YEAR. AND THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER DROUGHT LOOMING WE CAN ILL AFFORD ANY DELAY IN TAKING THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE ON AB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'VE GOT ANOTHER PERSON HERE SIGNED UP ROGER DICKINSON.

CDC MEMBERS HAVE BEEN SUSTAINABLY MANAGING GROUNDWATER LONG BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF SIGMA WHICH WE SUPPORTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN UNFORTUNATELY CDC METRIC RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SEVEN FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT BY PUSHING BACK THE DEADLINE FOR MANAGEMENT UNDER GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN WILL RESULT IN INCREASED CAUGHT. DID YOU SEE REPRESENTS WATER AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING TO FORM GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES AS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT PUSHED BACK THE DEADLINE FOR A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN WILL ONLY LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS. ADDITIONALLY UNDER CURRENT LAW THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS THE OPTION TO GIVE A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS TO REMEDY AN INCOMPLETE OR ON A DOCTOR GRAHAM UNDERSTAND ABILITY PLAN SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR THE HUNDRED AND. EIGHTY DAY EXTENSION AND THIS GIRL. I'VE FORMER SENATOR DICK AND ALL THEIR ONE OF THE OF THE SIGNAL THEY- JUST MENTION. THE JANUARY THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE FOR HIGHER MEDIUM PRIORITY BASIN. TO BE MANAGED UNDER A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE JANUARY OF TWENTY FIFTEEN.

THANK YOU MISTER RIGO. WHICH MEANT. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE AUTHOR- THINK THAT THERE'S REQUEST OF GONE OUT TO ELIMINATION IS TRYING TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION BUT I JUST LIKE TO GIVE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. MY BACKGROUND IN TERMS OF I SERVED ON A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY FOR. MORE THAN FIVE YEARS- AND DURING THE WHOLE TIME THAT WE WERE TRYING TO BRING- THE OUR BASE IN THAT COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR BASIN IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY. BUT THAT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AGENCY- THAT I SERVED ON IT WAS AN AGENCY ACTUALLY FORMED. MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TO STOP THE SALT WATER INTRUSION BECAUSE THE OCEAN DEAD PROMPTED BASIN DOWN BELOW SEA LEVEL. AND NOW THEY WERE GETTING SALT WATER INTRUSION. AND THEY WERE GIVEN A MANDATE BY THIS VERY BODY IS LEGISLATURE OF CALIFORNIA. TO GET THAT ALL IN SHAPE- BY AND THE DEADLINE WAS TWENTY TEN THAT THEY HAD THE THEY HAD THIS BRING THIS. SALT WATER INTRUSION- I TO. RIVERSIDE AND SAVE THIS PRECIOUS SOCCER FOR A TREMENDOUS AQUIFER THAT THEY HAVE THERE. AND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THE HISTORY OF IT WAS NOTHING BUT- KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD FIGHTING EVERY DEADLINE ALL THE WAY THROUGH. AND THEY- CONSIST- DID NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT'S WHEN YOU START THIS EXTENSION OF DEADLINES. THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER REASON AND THERE WAS ALWAYS ANOTHER REASON WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA THE EXPERT WAS TIED UP DESERVES IT IN IT. AND TO KICK SOMETHING DOWN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS- WAS WAS LIKE I JUST LIKE VERY- IT'S VERY DETRIMENTAL TO THE PEOPLE OF THE TURRET COUNTY SO AFTER SERVING FIVE YEARS IN HEARING EVERY REASON UNDER THE SUN- AT THAT- YEAH IT'S SERVING IN THAT CAPACITY. I AM VERY RELUCTANT TO HAVE US BEGIN DOWN THIS PROCESS- HERE SO- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE AUTHOR- BUT I THINK IT IS DANGEROUS FOR US TO DO THIS. WE ALREADY HAVE THEY'VE HAD SEVEN YEARS. SEVEN YEARS KNOWING THERE WAS A DEADLINE WHEN CULVER HT PEOPLE COULD SAY HEY WORK WHATEVER WAS YOU'RE PLANNING ON DOING YOU GOT IF YOU HAVE TO GET IT DONE. BUT INSTEAD OF ALWAYS THE DEFAULT WHEN IT COMES TO GROUND WATER SEEMS TO BE JUST PUSH THE DEADLINE. WE'RE GOING INTO THE SECOND YEAR THAT'S OF THIS DROUGHT THE GROUNDWATER BASINS HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM THE FIRST TRIAL- IF WE DON'T. A SENSE OF URGENCY AND HOLD PEOPLE TO THAT SENSE OF URGENCY I THINK WE JUST WON'T GET THE JOB DONE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE COUNTING. ON US TO TRY TO GET GROUND LIBATIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME TO BE PUMPING AT A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL I CERTAINLY RESPECT THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE ON THIS. AND CERTAINLY RESPECT THAT PEOPLE WANT TO TRY TO HELP IN IN THAT THE- PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO DO THIS BUT I.

A POINT OF NO RETURN WHEN IT COMES TO WATER% IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE EXTREME DROUGHT THE CLIMATE. CRISIS IS- ON TOP OF US AND WE SEEM TO BE THINKING LET'S JUST CONTINUE TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE TIME. WHEN THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF TIME AND- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE- WE SEE EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING- IT WOULD BE LIKE WE WOULD BE IN DENIAL- THAT WERE IN THE MIDST OF THIS DROUGHT- IF WE WERE TO.

THANK YOU FOR OUR MISSILES. THANK RICH CHAIRMAN MISTER MATHIS SEVEN QUICK SIMPLE QUESTION- THE EXTENSION THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN THIS IS IT BECAUSE- THE FOLKS JUST DON'T WANT TO EMBRACE SIGNAL OR IS IT BECAUSE OF OTHER THINGS IS BECAUSE A KOBE IT IS BECAUSE THEY JUST CAN'T GET TOGETHER- WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THE EXTENSION THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER SALAS. THE EXTENSION HERE THAT THIS ISN'T ONE IT'S NOT A MANDATORY EXTENSION SO I'D LIKE TO CLEAR THE AIR ON THAT THIS IS NOT KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. THIS IS NOT DENYING THE FACT THAT SIGMA NEEDS TO GET DONE AND THAT IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN QUICKLY. I REPRESENT AT MY HOMETOWN IN FACT IS THE CITY WITHOUT WATER PORTABLE CALIFORNIA. WHO GOT. AFFECTED THE MOST OUT OF THE LAST DROUGHT. WE WENT THROUGH. WHO STILL HAS PEOPLE LIVING IN THIRD WORLD WATER CONDITIONS. SO I KNOW THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY. MY COMMUNITY FACES THESE DAYS. THE FACT IS THAT WHEN ALL THIS WAS SAID IN PLAN. SO IT WAS NOT IN THE CARDS. A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WAS NOT IN THE CARDS. THIS BILL ISN'T TO HELP THE BAD ACTORS THIS BILL GIVES THE DEPARTMENT V.

SKEWS ME OR REQUIRE ANY COVER PROJECT WITHIN THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA TO COMPLETE AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE. ON ANY PROJECT. FOR TOO LONG DECISIONS IN THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS RATHER BEEN. RATHER THAN BY THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. WHILE THE STATE HAS MADE STRIDES TOWARD RESOLVING THESE ISSUES OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS CONFIDENCE IN THE STATE DECISION MAKING HAS BEEN DIMINISHED AMONG THE RESIDENTS OF THE DELTA. AB NINETEEN THIRTY NINE TAKES A SMALL STEP TOWARDS RESTORING THAT CONFIDENCE. IN THIS BILL WILL CODIFY EXISTING OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL GUIDANCE. ON SEA LEVEL RISE FOR THE LEGAL DELTA. ENSURING THAT ANY FUTURE PROJECT WILL HAVE TO IT. WILL HAVE TO ANALYZE THE IMPACTS OF AT LEAST A TEN FOOT RIGHTS. GIVEN ARE RAPIDLY ADVANCING SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF SEA LEVEL RISE IT'S TIME TO EMBRACE COMMONSENSE PLANNING ANALYSIS AND A DEPUTATION MEASURES SUCH AS- THE ONES RECOMMENDED BY THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. AGENCIES ARE ALREADY ENCOURAGING ENCOURAGE UTILIZES GUIDANCE IN THEIR PLANNING PERMITTING AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS NAB'S NINE SEVEN NINE ONE SURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE GUIDANCE CAN BE ENJOYED BY RESIDENTS OF THE DELTA. FOR THE YEARS TO COME. LEGISLATURE HAS COME HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING FOR THE INCLUSION OF CONCRETE SEA LEVEL RISE ANALYSIS AND STATUTES. AB NINE SEVEN NINE SIMPLY UPDATES THE STATUTE TO INCLUDE THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE ON SEA LEVEL RISE PRODUCTION PROJECTIONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL BROAD STREET FROM SAVE THE CALIFORNIA DELTA ALLIANCE THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED. MY RECORD POLICE. MODERATE CAN YOU LEFT OUT THE KEY WITNESS. MR BRODSKY MR BRODSKY PRESENT YES KEEP IN MIND ARE OPEN. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU. YEAH YES SORRY ABOUT THAT I WAS HAVING A TECHNICAL PROBLEM- YES MICHAEL BRODSKY OF REPRESENTING STATE THE CALIFORNIA DELTA ALLIANCE A SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE. AND THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE SEALEVEL RISE. AND ACCOUNTING FOR SEA LEVEL RISE IN PROJECT PLANNING IN THE DELTA IS VERY IMPORTANT- MUCH OF THE DELTA OF LIFE CONSIDERABLY BELOW SEA LEVEL. AND RISING SEA LEVEL WILL PUT INCREASING PRESSURE ON OUR LEVEES AND THEREFORE PREDICTING- ACCURATELY HOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IMPORTANT FOR PROJECT PLANNING. ALSO IN THE DELTA THE ECOLOGY OF THE DELTA IS DEPENDENT ON A VERY DELICATE FRESH AND SALT WATER MIX. AND L. C. LEVEL RISES THAT FRESH SALT WATER MIX WILL CHANGE ADD SALT WATER APPROACH WAS FURTHER INTO THE DELTA. SO SEALABLE RICE IS VERY SIGNIFICANT- WITH REGARD. TO PLANNING DELTA PROJECTS. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE BASIC STANDARD IS FOR DELTA PROJECT PLANNING THAT WE USE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE BUT THAT DOESN'T DETERMINE. WHAT PROTOCOLS AND WHAT STANDARDS ARE TO BE USED- WHEN PREDICTING SEA LEVEL RISE SO THIS BILL BRING CERTAINTY. BY SPECIFYING PARTICULAR STANDARDS THAT ARE THE MOST RECENT AND CONSIDERED- THE PASSED AT THIS TIME. AND SO THAT WILL ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE FUTURE WILL BRING CERTAINTY TO PROJECT PLANNING IT WILL PUT AT BASICALLY THE TOP OF THE CHECKLIST FOR PROJECT PROPONENTS IN THE DELTA WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO IN REGARDS TO PLANNING FOR SEA LEVEL RISE. SO THAT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE WON'T BE OVERLOOKED OR MISSED SO- THAT'S WHY WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND BEEN REGISTERED SO WE'LL ASK DOES ANYONE IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM. TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. CASEY NO ONE ANYONE HERE IN THE CHAMBER.

WE SUPPORT THE DOT THE PLAN INCLUDING ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF STAKEHOLDER ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AND WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY. AB NINE SEVEN NINE WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC AGENCIES BUSINESSES AND PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS TO ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF A WIDE ARRAY OF MODELS SEALEVEL RISE PROJECTIONS ON EVERY PROJECT IN THE DOUBTS AND NO MATTER HOW SMALL.

THE BILL WOULD IMPOSE CONSIDERABLE COSTS AN UNDUE BURDEN ON THE PRODUCT OPPONENTS INCLUDING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE LANDOWNERS. TO CONDUCT SUCH A COMPLEX THE LEVEL RIGHT NOW SAYS WHICH REQUIRES EXPERTS WITH SPECIFIC NEEDS EXPERIENCE. AB NINE SEVEN NINE ALSO UNNECESSARY THE DELTA PLAN ALREADY REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE THE PROJECT TO THE DELTA THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE STATE POLITICAL CALLS.

AND PROVIDE PUBLIC ACCESS OR RECREATIONAL AMENITIES OR REDUCE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE DROUGHT FLOOD. IN OTHER CATASTROPHE EVENTS. MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS PROGRAM WILL BENEFIT THE MANY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE DESERT REGION. THESE ARE COMMUNITIES HAVE SUFFERED DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM ONGOING ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS AND THE ONGOING COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE CALIFORNIA DESERT MERITS INCREASED PUBLIC ATTENTION. AND INVESTMENT THE DESERT REGION IS HOME TO THE LARGEST STILL INTACT ECOSYSTEM IN THE LOWER FORTY EIGHT STATES. THESE LANDS PERFORM CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL ROLES INCLUDING CAPTURING AND STORING CARBON TO HELP US FIGHT THE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS. THE DESERT REGION IS ALSO THE HOMELAND OF NEW NUMEROUS TRIBAL COMMUNITIES SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM DESERT CONSERVATION PROGRAMS THAT WOULD PROTECT CULTURAL RESOURCES- ARTIFACTS. AND AVOID INADVERTENT DISCOVERY OF NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA FUNDING INITIATIVES INCLUDES PASSED BONDS HAVE INVESTED FAR LESS CONSERVATION FUNDING TO THE DESERT THAN OTHER AREAS.

FIRST THE AUTHOR ACCEPTS THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AB ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR CLARIFIES A PUBLIC AGENCY REGULATING RESERVOIRS USED FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES ARE TO BE TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS PRIVATE REGULATORY FACILITIES. REAGAN REGULATING RESERVOIR AS A SMALL RESERVOIR CONSTRUCTED TO STORE WATER THAT WOULD OTHERWISE SPILL OVER FROM CANAL SYSTEMS CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA WATER CODE. RECOGNIZES THE BENEFIT OF THESE PRACTICES IN CLEARLY STATES THE STRUCTURE USED TO STORE WATER FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES IS X. THEM DEAD FROM STATE REGULATORY. JUSTICE JURISDICTION EXCUSE ME HOWEVER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES HAS ADOPTED CONTRARY TO ITS PRIOR PRIOR VIEW INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAW THAT EXCLUDES PUBLIC ENTITIES FROM TAKING PART IN AGRICULTURE USE EXEMPTION. AB ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR WOULD ENABLE PUBLIC ENTITIES TO CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY.

THE SCREEN OR RIVER THE INFLOWS CONTROLLED AND THE RESERVOIRS ONLY OPERATE WHEN AN IRRIGATION DISTRICT IS RUNNING WATER THROUGH ITS CONVEYANCE SYSTEM. WHAT THE ONSET OF THE WATER CONSERVATION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINE AND STIGMA PUBLICATION SEEDS ALL OVER THE STATE INCLUDING THE BEST OF YOUR NATION DISTRICT ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS SUCH AS THE USE AND THE LEGISLATION WILL HELP.

AFTER THIS BILL WE HAVE A ONE LEFT. AND WE'RE GONNA SEE IF WE COULD GET. A BRING BRING THAT TO OUR MISTER FRIEDMAN'S ATTENTION. WE HAVE ABOUT ONE BILL THAT WOULD BE MRS MISTREATMENT. WILL LET HER KNOW THAT- SHE'S UP AFTER THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB THIRTY WOULD AFFIRM THAT ACCESS TO NATURE AND ITS BENEFITS OR HUMAN RIGHTS AND WOULD ALSO DIRECTS STATE AGENCIES TO INCORPORATE CONSIDERATION OF THAT RIGHT. INTO EXISTING POLICIES REGARDING ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS. ESPECIALLY FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OR HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN NATURE DEPRIVED. ALL NATURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ARRESTED FOR PEOPLE ACROSS MANY BACKGROUNDS THE PANDEMIC IS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED INEQUITIES AND ACCESSING CLEAN AND SAFE OUTDOOR SPACES. AND WORST CASE SCENARIOS THERE'S A LACK OF ACCESS TO THE SPACES ALL TOGETHER. BEING BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE MANY BENEFITS OF NATURE IS NECESSARY FOR THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THE OVERALL WILL BE IT BEING OF PEOPLE. BUT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR FAR LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO NATURE. A 70% A LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TODAY LIVE IN NATURE DEPRIVED AREAS I CAN SEE THAT MYSELF. I IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN PARTS OF SAN JOSE- WHERE THERE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE YOU HAVE TO. WALK FOR A VERY LONG TIME TO GET TO ANY KIND OF OPEN SPACES OR EVEN PARKS. SIMILARLY INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES LIVING IN RURAL AREAS HAVE LIKEWISE SUFFER DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. AND DISPLACEMENT. AS A DISTRICT DESTRUCTION OF NATURE EXCEL REYES OF UNPRECEDENTED RATES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER FACTORS MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BEAR MORE OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. IF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO CONTINUE TO LEAD ON CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES A MUST NOT LEAVE AUDIBLE COMMITTEES BEHIND ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME WHEN THEY NEED TO BE LIFTED UP THE MOST. AB THIRTY PUTS ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS AND NATURE FRONT AND CENTER AND THIS BILL ENSURES THAT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT MORE INCLUSIVE APPROACH TO WHO GETS TO EXPERIENCE NATURE AND ITS BENEFITS. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH PHYSICAL ACCESS TO AMENITIES SUCH AS PARKS BEACHES REGIONAL OPEN SPACES OF WILDERNESS AREAS. OR BY BEING ABLE TO ENJOY CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND OTHER BENEFITS OF A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. AB THIRTY WOULD AFFIRM THAT ACCESS TO NATURE AND AS BENEFITS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS. AND BY ADOPTING AB THIRTY CALIFORNIA BECOME THE FIRST DAY DECLARE THAT ACCESS TO NATURE IS HUMAN RIGHTS SUDDEN IMPORTING. SETTING AN IMPORTANT EXAMPLE FOR THE REST OF THE NATION. BUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES CAN BENEFIT ACTIVELY. ACTIVELY IN OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO PROTECT NATURE. THIS BILL ENJOYS BROAD SUPPORT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION GROUPS INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. INCLUDING NURSES AND PHYSICIANS. ACCESS TO PUBLIC LAND H. AND A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT SHOULD BE A RIGHT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS I'M GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO CHAMPION THIS BILL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. AUDUBON CALIFORNIA AZUL AND LATINO OUTDOORS. SPECTER HAS ARRIVED I HAVE A- THANK YOU SO MUCH. APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH OF MEMBERS AND- THE CHAIR.

OF THE BOOK ONLINE CALIFORNIANS ARE CO SPONSORS- COULD PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH YOU. THE PHILIPPINE AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITY BECAUSE OF THIS IT EXPERIENCE WE UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO CONNECT PEOPLE WITH NATURE ENSURE THAT THE- BENEFITS ARE ENJOYED BY EVERYONE. UNFORTUNATELY AS MISTER KALRA SAID- OUTDOOR pSPACES ARE STILL NOT EQUITABLE EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE. A FACT THAT CODEPENDENT BECAUSE MICHELIN BOXLIGHT CORP IN NINETEEN HAS SHOWN US THAT. OXYGENATOR IS NECESSARY FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH WHILE PEOPLE AND THEN MAKE FURTHER ILLUSTRATED THAT DUE TO THE HISTORICAL BASIS SEGREGATIONIST IN EQUITY. PEOPLE OF COLOR OR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM ON EQUAL ACCESS. TO NATURE AND ITS BENEFITS. THE RECENT REPORT BY THE- OCCUPIED NATION AND THAT THE FOR A PROGRESS ON THE COMMUNITIES COLOR A THREE. MORE LIKELY THAN THEIR WHITE CAL DILEMMA YOUR HI JERRY. AND 70% OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT TO MAKE. ASSEMBLY WELL THE FATE HAD PROGRESS TOWARDS PROMOTING BUT WHAT JUST ALL THAT- MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO WITH A VALUE BY STOP KERR OF THE DIRECT INVESTMENT TO INCREASE ACT. AND PRIVATE THE VOICES NEED PRIORITY LOOKING CALL AND THIS INDUSTRY. AND ECONOMICALLY TO COMMUNITIES BOTH IN RURAL AND OR READ. I TELL LOOKS TACKLE ISSUE THE RESERVE AND OF COURSE PARK IN MY RECOGNIZE AFTER I'M GOING TO BACK MAKE SURE I'LL TELL OTHERS HAVE IN THE FOR ACCESS NATURE TO BANISH. THIS BILL WOULD DECLARE TO PAULA OF THE THAT IN IN THE% BENEFIT ARE RIGHTS INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO GREEN SPACES IN NATURE CREEK HEALTH DISPARITIES AND OTHER INEQUITIES.

FRIEDMAN I CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA HI KALRA THANK KALRA AYE LEVINE LEVINE AYE MERE SUJI NORMAN RUBIO RUBIO AYE SALAS SALAS I SMITH SMITH NOVIA PADURA VIA PADILLA I WARD. LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON WE HAVE OUR FINAL BILL OF THE EVENING AND- COLLEAGUE CHAIR TRANSPORTATIONS HERE. TO PRESENT A. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR. FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL. LAST WEEK GOVERNOR NEWSOM DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. OF A FOR A DRAFT OF EMERGENCY FOR MENDOCINO AND SONOMA COUNTIES DUE TO THE DROUGHT. IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED LAST MONTH FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES I DON'T SUGGEST MENTAL INSTITUTIONAL STATE WATER PROJECT ALLOCATION FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE WATER YEAR. THE DEPARTMENT NOW EXPECTS TO DELIVER FIVE PERCENT. THE REQUESTED SUPPLIES THIS YEAR DOWN FROM THE INITIAL ALLOCATION OF 10% AN OUNCE IN DECEMBER. ALSO IN MARCH THE US BUREAU OF RECLAMATION ANNOUNCED THAT BASED ON ITS PROJECTIONS IT MIGHT DECLARE AN OFFICIAL SHORTAGE ON THE COLORADO RIVER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY. THREATENING ONE SUPPLY OF WATER THAT CALIFORNIA DEPENDS ON. MEMBERS WERE ENTERING ANOTHER DROUGHT. DURING PASSED THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL CALL ON ALL WATER AGENCIES TO CUT BACK ON THEIR WATER USAGE BY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE EVERYONE CUT BACK 20% EVERYONE CUT BACK THIRTY PERCENT. WELL IF YOU'RE IN THE AREA WE ARE ALREADY CONSERVATIONS A WAY OF LIFE WE'RE ALREADY YOU'RE STRETCHING EVERY DROP OF WATER. THIS CAN BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE. AND MANY WATER AGENCIES HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WATER EFFICIENCY TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY ARE USING AS LITTLE WATER AS POSSIBLE AND USING THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGY FOR- FOR CONSERVATION. AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AFTER WORKING FOR TWO YEARS ON THESE BILLS. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. AND SB SIX OH SIX WHICH ESTABLISHED NEW WALK LONG TERM WATER EFFICIENCY GOALS. WITH THE METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING WATER USE TARGETS THAT'S CUSTOMIZED TO EACH AGENCY. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NEW DATA AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS. THE CUSTOMIZED TARGETS ARE BASED ON THREE STANDARDS. THE INDOOR STANDARDS THAT ARE SET BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE OUTER STANDARD WITH THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED IF YOU ARE TO DEVELOP AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD. AND A WATER LOSS STANDARD THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED BY THE STATE BOARD. THE STANDARDS DO NOT APPLY TO INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDS. AND WATER AGENCIES DON'T EVEN HAVE TO MEET EACH STANDARD THEY JUST HAVE TO COMPLY WITH AN OVERALL TARGET. THIS PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN WHOLE WATER AGENCY MEETS ITS TARGET IF THEY'RE OVER THEIR TARGET WATER BUDGET. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE DATA ON INTER WATER USED TO ESTABLISH A STANDARD IN THAT ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. SO THE BILL INTRICATE. INCLUDED A PLACE HOLD NUMBER. AND THOSE NUMBER AND THEN WE DIRECTED D. W. R. THE STATE FOR TO STUDY. INDOOR WATER USE AND REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. A JOINT RECOMMENDATION FOR WATER USE THAT BECAUSE OF CODE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT WORK WAS DELAYED. AT A DRAFT REPORT WAS RELEASED JUST LAST THURSDAY AND THE STATE IS NOW TAKING PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE DRAFT UNTIL MAY THIRTEENTH. THEY HOPE TO COMPLETE A FINAL REPORT BY THE END OF JUNE. CURRENTLY OVER 75% OF WATER AGENCIES ARE ALREADY DOING BETTER. THAN THE FIFTY FIVE G. P. PCT D. W. R. STATED THAT THE CURRENT AVERAGE IS TWENTY ONE. THREE FIFTY ONE AND THE MEDIAN IS FORTY EIGHT. AT G. P. CD BASED ON MONTHLY DATA REPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THE DRAFT EMENDATIONS FOR. DO P. OR FOUR. FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WHICH IS NO CHANGE. FORTY SEVEN FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE. AND FORTY TWO FOR TWO THOUSAND THIRTY. I INTRODUCED AB FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR TO UPDATE THE INDOOR RESIDENTIAL WATER USE STANDARD TO VALUES THAT MORE APPROPRIATELY REFLECT CURRENT PRACTICES AND TRENDS FOR INDOOR RESIDENTIAL. WATER USE IN CALIFORNIA. NOW IT'S NOT OUR INTENT TO INTRODUCE NUMBERS THAT ARE NOT ACHIEVABLE OR STRETCH GOALS FOR WATER AGENCIES. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE SETS THE STANDARD AT INDOOR WATER USE IS DECLINING ALREADY. DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY REPLACEMENT OF OLD WATER FIXTURES AND A HIGHER COST OF WATER TO WATER USERS. SO WHY NOW. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LEGISLATION ASK FOR THE RECOMMENDATION SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT THE STANDARDS BEFORE THE STATE WATER BOARD BEGINS THE PROCESS OF SETTING THE AGENCY'S OVERALL WATER TARGETS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. IN ADDITION SETTING THE INDOOR STANDARDS INFORMS THE PROCESS OF D. W. R. SAID IN THE OUTDOOR STANDARDS. IF WE PUT OFF UPDATING THE UNDERSTAND OR TO NEXT YEAR THE STATE MAY ALSO NEED TO REVISIT THE OUTDOOR STANDARDS. WHICH COULD THEN LEAD TO ANOTHER EIGHTEEN MONTH RULE MAKING BY OUR STATE BOARD. THE CURRENT NUMBERS FOR THE INTEREST AND IN THE BILL OR PLACEHOLDER NUMBERS ALSO AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S OUR INTENT TO FOLLOW THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND TO AMEND THE BILL IN ACCORDING AND ACCORDING TO THE AGENCY'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS EVENING OR BARBARA AMERO DEPUTY MAYOR OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. AND HEATHER COOLEY WITH THE PACIFIC INSTITUTE IN OAKLAND. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I VOTED WE PLEDGE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ACHIEVABLE FOR EVERYBODY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE CITY WITNESSES. UP BEGIN THEIR TESTIMONY. HI THIS IS HEATHER COOLEY AND DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH WITH THE- INSTITUTE AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR. THE STATE MADE A COMMITMENT TO SCIENCE AT THAT WATER EFFICIENCY STANDARDS IN AB FIFTEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT. AT THE TIME LIMITED DATA WERE AVAILABLE ON INDOOR WATER USE AND FIFTY FIVE G. PPP THE COLLECTED AT THE PLACE HOLDER. WE NOW KNOW THAT FIFTY FIVE IF YOU HIGH. CONTRAST STUDY RELEASED BY D. W. AREN'T STATE STATE WATER BOARD CONFIRMED THAT CURRENT RESIDENTIAL INDOOR WATER USE IN CALIFORNIA. THE FIFTY ONE GALLON PER PERSON PER DAY. WE ALSO KNOW INDOOR THAT. AS OLD FIND COULDN'T PICTURE ARE REFER WITH EFFICIENT MODEL. SEVERAL STUDIES INCLUDING RECENT PACIFIC INSTITUTE ANALYSES ESTIMATE INDOOR USAGE FOR HOME MEETING CURRENT STANDARDS WOULD BE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE GALLONS PER PERSON PER DAY. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO STANDARDS AND CODES FOR APPLIANCES AND FIXTURES IN NEW AND EXISTING HOME. SOME RAISE CONCERNS THAT REDUCING THE AND OUR STANDARD WOULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. HOWEVER THE DRAFT STUDY RELEASED LAST WEEK FOUND THAT LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD USING LESS WATER AND HIGHER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. SOME ALSO RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECT ON RECYCLED WATER. THE FRAMEWORK PROVIDES SEX FLEXIBILITY TO ATTRACT THE CONCERNED BUT THE KEY POINT IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT INDOOR FOR CAPITA USE IS DECLINING DUE TO STANDARDS AND CODES AND IT'S CRITICAL COMMUNITIES RECOGNIZE THIS TREND. SO THAT THE RIGHT SIZE RECYCLED WATER INVESTMENTS TO ABORT THE NFC JERRY KAUFMAN STRANDED OUT AT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF YOU ARE IS CAñADA TO ENGAGE STATE AND FINALIZING THE IN YOUR WATER USE REPORT IN A TIMELY MANNER. TO ENSURE THAT BOTH THE INDOOR AND OUTDOOR STANDARDS ARE BASED ON SCIENCE. AT FOURTEEN THIRTY FIVE IS URGENTLY NEEDED THIS YEAR. I ASKED THE SUPPORT PATH PASSAGE OF AB FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR WITH THE AMENDMENT COULD COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE NEXT WITNESS.

HI GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS GLENN PARLIAMENTS ACCOUNTING WATER AUTHORITY I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE REDUCE STANDARDS- POTENTIAL IMPACT ON POTABLE REUSE AND RECYCLE WATER PARK PRODUCTION AND- REGRETTABLY MUST OPPOSE THE CALL. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPENING THE MATTER BACK TO THE DICE AND ACID THE PUBLIC SAYS QUESTIONS COMMENTS MOVES RECOMMENDED ACTIONS. THAT A MOTION TO MISS BENNET. IS OUR SECOND. SECOND MEMBERS CAR I HAVE PROGRAM YES WE DID IT- I APPRECIATE. THE AUTHOR'S- COMMIT TO CONSTANTLY. NET JOSH AS THE DAY COME IN- MOVING FOR I'D LIKE TO- ACTUALLY ASK YOU. TO OF SOME OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS BEING PREMATURE AND WHAT I BELIEVE YOU ARE VERY ARTICULATED ABOUT WHY WE NEED TO MOVE NOW. BASED ON THE CALENDAR. YEAH BECAUSE THEY ALTER STANDARDS ARE ALSO BEING SAID WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE THE MOST ACCURATE STAND A NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE. FOR THE INDOOR STANDARDS BECAUSE OTHERWISE TO MAKE THE MATH WORK THEY COULD START TO SOCIALLY THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER. SO WE DO HAVE SOME DATA PULMONARY DATA NOW THAT'S FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS IN THE MAKING AND WE THINK THAT IT'S STILL PRUDENT TO GO AHEAD AND JUST CONTINUE TO REFINE THAT NUMBER. AS THE BILL MOVES TO THE PROCESS. CAN AND IF. AND IF WE DON'T THEN WE WOULD KNOW WHAT TO SEE TO SEE OUT WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE TO STATE THAT ARE REALLY BASS ON THE THAT WE THAT WE KNOW A ARE REAL THANK YOU MUCH OKAY. GAELIC THE COMMENTS. QUESTIONS. PLEASE ALRIGHT JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT TO THIS FRIEDMAN UP WELL WHAT ABOUT THE- YOU KNOW I MEAN I. OBVIOUSLY I SUPPORT YOUR GOAL OF A- PROMOTING WATER CONSERVATION BUT- NORMALLY I DON'T SEE LIKE THE MUNICIPAL WATER AGENCIES AS BEING LIKE A- SUSPECT INTEREST GROUP ARE. YOU KNOW THAT WHERE I HAVE TO QUESTION NO. THEIR THEIR MOTIVES AND SO I'M I'M I'M JUST YOU KNOW TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING HERE RESPONSIBILITY YEAH THEY THEY SAY THAT NOT ONLY. DO WE DO THEY NEED TO. THE UPDATED NUMBERS BUT THEY NEED THIS THIS. YOU KNOW VIGOROUS- STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BEFORE. AND THAT THAT WAS PART OF THE DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK WITH THE PREVIOUS- BILL COULD YOU. ADDRESS THAT NOW WE'RE AFRAID THAT IF WE PUT THIS OFF THIS COULD DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NUMBERS FOR UP TO THREE YEARS. AND WE DO THINK IT'S A PROCESS BUT WE NEED IT WE THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN IT NOW. I WE'RE GOING TO DROUGHT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL AGENCIES ARE PRACTICING CONSERVATION AND THAT MEANS HAVING A STANDARD A TARGET. FOR EVERYBODY TO WORK ON THAT'S REALISTIC WE KNOW THAT THE TARGET THAT WAS IN THE BILL WAS ACTUALLY- HAD AN AMOUNT OF WATER THAT WAS LOWER THAN IS ACTUALLY BEING USED. WITHIN THE STATE SO IF YOU HAVE A TARGET THAT'S TOO HIGH THAT'S ALREADY WERE ALREADY WITHIN YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOING TO GET ANYBODY TO MOVE THE ENVELOPE VERY MUCH. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN WITH THE WATER AGENCIES THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SELL THE WATER BUT THEY NEED TO SELL- AND THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE BUT- WE WILL WORK WITH THEM YOU KNOW AS A PARTY AS WELL. WHO GOT ALMOST ALL OF THEM IN THE LAST TIME TO GO FROM SLIDING OUT THE DOOR IN OPPOSITION TO SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. TO BE MOST OF THEM EITHER BEING IN FAVOR OF IT OR BEING NEUTRAL ON THE BILL AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. NO QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT DOES NOT HAVE A TO PASS- TO APPROPRIATIONS THEY JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT YOU KNOW WE ALSO HEARD A LOT FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS- THAT SPOKE TODAY BUT ONE OF THINGS I THINK WOULD BE A GOOD- POLICY. KIND OF APPROACH. WOULD BE T POTENTIALLY BRINGS BILL BACK ONCE TERE'S SOME MORE SENSITIVE INFORMATION. COMING FROM THE REPORT. IN ORDER FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS MEMBERS TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE. DELIBERATION ON IT AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO HAVE SOME IMPORTANT SO WE DO HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. AND OUR COMMITTEE STAFF WAS COULD BE WORKING CLOSELY. WITH THEIR TEAM AND AT THE RIGHT MOMENT- BRING THE BILL BACK FOR HEARING AND HAVING SOME ADDITIONAL INPUT I THINK WOULD BE A GOOD PRACTICE FOR US. GIVEN THE TIMING- OF THE BILL AND THE LACK OF INFORMATION THAT WE'LL WAIT. IN ORDER TO MAKE A MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIVE A POLICY DECISION. SO- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. A DEAL SITE YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO DO THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AFFECTED AGENCIES. HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY FEEL IS WORKABLE A TARGET THAT MAKES SENSE THAT GOES PUSH AGENCIES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN AS GOOD WITH CONSERVATION TO KIND OF GET WITH THE PROGRAM TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS. IN THE REPAIRS ARE THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY WORK ON THEIR OWN WEEKS AND THEIR SYSTEM PROFICIENCY WITHIN THEIR SYSTEMS THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE GOAL. IT'S NOT PUNITIVE IT'S ABOUT EVERYBODY IN THE STATE RECOGNIZING THAT WE ALL RISE OR FALL TOGETHER WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE WATER WHEN WE NEED IT THE MOST AND THAT MEANS INVESTING IN. IN NOT JUST CONSERVATION BUT INEFFICIENCY IT'S- IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO PUSH EVERYONE TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS WE CAN BE AND WE ALL HAVE TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THESE. THESE MEASURES HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOR US FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND WE ABSOLUTELY WILL. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO PATRICK.
