BELIEVE THE FIRST PERHAPS. AND

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:09.895
THAT THE MONEY THAT THEY WERE

02:06:09.962 --> 02:06:10.829
RECEIVING A JUSTIN. TO PAY FOR

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.431

02:06:15.434 --> 02:06:16.302
IN TO AN END OF THAT IS

02:06:16.368 --> 02:06:18.203
HOMELESS THAT IS DELIVERING

02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:20.639
FOOD AND THAT IS ALSO HUNGRY.

02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:21.640
THAT IS A WHOLE OTHER

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:22.508
CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE

BUT AMID COLD IT. WHAT IS THE

02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:32.051
WHATARE THE CHANCES THAT YOUR

02:06:45.898 --> 02:06:47.232
AND THE CUSTOMER IS NOT

02:06:47.299 --> 02:06:50.269
SATISFIED THEY DON'T GO ONLINE

02:06:50.336 --> 02:06:51.170
AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THE

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:54.340

COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RESTAURANT.

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:58.210
AND THE RESTAURANT HAS NO

02:06:58.277 --> 02:07:00.512
IMPACT TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

02:07:00.579 --> 02:07:02.147
THAT FOOD IS DELIVERED AND THE

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:03.649
AND THE INDIVIDUAL THAT HURTS

02:07:03.716 --> 02:07:05.751
THE MOST IS THAT RESTAURANT

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:09.521
BECAUSE THE FOOD HASN'T BEEN

02:07:09.588 --> 02:07:12.191
SEALED OR DOESN'T HAVE A SOME

02:07:12.257 --> 02:07:14.193
KIND OF FIELD. TO AVOID ANY

02:07:14.259 --> 02:07:16.095
ISSUES IN THE RESTAURANT IN MY

02:07:16.161 --> 02:07:17.629
COMMUNITY AND MY DISTRICT THE

02:07:17.696 --> 02:07:19.832
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT I HAVE

02:07:19.898 --> 02:07:22.368
SPOKEN TO. THEY LIKE THE IDEA

02:07:22.434 --> 02:07:24.670
OF BEING IN CONTROL. OF

02:07:24.737 --> 02:07:26.572
PREPARING THE FOOD PUTTING THE

02:07:26.638 --> 02:07:28.307
FOOD IN A CONTAINER IN THE BACK

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:30.309
SEALING IT WITH A STICKER OR

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:32.511
WITH STAPLES. AND THEN HANDING

02:07:32.578 --> 02:07:33.812
IT OFF TO SOMEONE ELSE TO BE

02:07:33.879 --> 02:07:35.948
DELIVERED THAT ENSURES THAT

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:37.649
THAT FOOD IS NOT CONTAMINATED

02:07:37.716 --> 02:07:39.551

02:07:44.623 --> 02:07:46.925
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL- IT ALSO

02:07:46.992 --> 02:07:49.294

02:38:59.963 --> 02:39:01.999
I'M A FORMER TRANSGENDER. AND I

02:39:04.534 --> 02:39:05.769
LIKE MINE. WHO REGRET

02:39:05.836 --> 02:39:07.738
TRANSITION. BUT UNLIKE TRYING A

02:39:07.804 --> 02:39:08.906
CAREER OR NEEDS FOR

02:39:08.972 --> 02:39:10.374
TRANSGENDERISM AS PERMANENT

02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:12.109
LIFE ALTERING CONSEQUENCES.

02:39:12.175 --> 02:39:14.111
MANY OF WHICH CANNOT BE UNDONE.

02:39:14.177 --> 02:39:15.145
THE PROBLEM IS IN THE MIND NOT

02:39:15.212 --> 02:39:16.914
THE BODY. IN MOST CASES

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:18.615
TRANSGENDERISM IS BIRTH OUT OF

02:39:18.682 --> 02:39:19.750
REJECTION OR OTHER EMOTIONAL

02:39:19.816 --> 02:39:22.052
WOUNDS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I

02:39:22.119 --> 02:39:23.186
WAS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF THE

02:39:23.253 --> 02:39:24.421
MAN. AND BEGAN TAKING

02:39:24.488 --> 02:39:25.956
TESTOSTERONE I HAD TWO MAJOR

02:39:26.023 --> 02:39:27.524
SURGERIES INCLUDING A DOUBLE

02:39:27.591 --> 02:39:29.626
MASTECTOMY. AND AT ALL FEMALE

02:39:29.693 --> 02:39:30.661
WORKERS ARE. THE FIRST I

02:39:30.727 --> 02:39:32.562
THOUGHT IT WAS EVERYTHING I'D

02:39:32.629 --> 02:39:33.397
EVER WANTED. WAS NOW LEGALLY

02:39:33.463 --> 02:39:34.531
MAILING OUT JOB WHERE I WAS

02:39:34.598 --> 02:39:36.066
ONLY KNOWN AS MALE. BUT

02:39:36.133 --> 02:39:37.434
INITIALLY I BECAME MORE AND

02:39:37.501 --> 02:39:38.769
MORE DEPRESSED. I FOUND WHAT

02:39:38.835 --> 02:39:40.270
THOUSANDS OF OTHERS HAVE THE

02:39:40.337 --> 02:39:42.673
TRANSITION ISN'T REAL. NOT ONLY

02:39:42.739 --> 02:39:44.207
WAS THE TRANSITION NOT REAL.

02:39:44.274 --> 02:39:45.776
BUT IT DID NOT RESOLVE THE PAIN

02:39:45.842 --> 02:39:47.177
IN THE UNDERLYING ISSUES I

02:39:47.244 --> 02:39:48.979
REALIZE ONE DAY BEFORE. THAT IT

02:39:49.046 --> 02:39:50.314
WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A MAN.

02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:51.882
BUT IT WAS TOO PAINFUL TO FACE

02:39:51.949 --> 02:39:53.650
BEING A WOMAN. I GRAPPLED WITH

02:39:53.717 --> 02:39:54.851
THE SAME THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE

02:39:54.918 --> 02:39:56.620
THAT MANY DO AFTER SURGERY.

02:39:56.687 --> 02:39:57.888
IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT YOU

02:39:57.955 --> 02:39:58.989
WERE IN MY SHOES HAVING

02:39:59.056 --> 02:40:00.524
PERMANENTLY ALTERED YOUR BODY.

02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:02.025
AND REALIZING THAT YOU HAD BEEN

02:40:02.092 --> 02:40:03.860
DUPED. BUT THANKFULLY FTER

02:40:03.927 --> 02:40:04.361
NINE YEARS OF LIVING IS

02:40:04.428 --> 02:40:06.196
TRANSGENDER I WAS RESCUED FROM

02:40:06.263 --> 02:40:08.098
THE HELL. I SHOULD BE DEAD I

02:40:08.165 --> 02:40:09.967
CONSIDER TAKING MY LIFE. BUT

02:40:10.033 --> 02:40:11.401
INSTEAD OUR CREATOR AND MY LORD

02:40:11.468 --> 02:40:14.871
AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST RESCUED

02:40:14.938 --> 02:40:15.472
ME. HE TOLD ME TO LEAVE IT ALL

02:40:15.539 --> 02:40:17.274

02:40:20.844 --> 02:40:21.378
TO BIND UP THE BROKEN HEARTED.

02:40:21.445 --> 02:40:22.446
AND THAT IS WHAT HE DID. HIS

02:40:22.512 --> 02:40:24.147
COMPLETELY HEALED ME AND SET ME.

02:40:24.214 --> 02:40:27.084
NOTED TO GO BACK NO DINNER JUST

02:40:27.150 --> 02:40:29.319

TREATED AT JOHNS HOPKINS

02:41:22.005 --> 02:41:24.174
HOSPITAL- THE CONCEPT IS

02:41:24.241 --> 02:41:26.243
IDEOLOGY NOT BASED ON SCIENCE

02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.977
AND BECAUSE OF THAT JOHNS

AND INDICATED THEY WOULD NOT

02:41:31.848 --> 02:41:32.816
CONTINUE BECAUSE IT LACKS

02:41:32.883 --> 02:41:35.318
SCIENCE AND WAS BASICALLY AN

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:37.254
IDEA. AND GENDER HAS NO

02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:38.889
BIOLOGIC BASIS IS OF AT THE

02:41:38.955 --> 02:41:41.291
STATE OF MIND THIRTEEN OF

02:41:41.358 --> 02:41:43.026
THIRTEEN PUBLISHED STUDIES SHOW

02:41:43.093 --> 02:41:44.594
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY A

02:41:57.107 --> 02:41:59.042
ADOLESCENCE THIS IS A NATURAL

02:41:59.109 --> 02:42:01.378
PROCESS WHICH IS BROUGHT ABOUT

02:42:01.445 --> 02:42:03.547

02:42:03.613 --> 02:42:05.048
NEED TO BE BLOCKED. NOT IN THE

02:42:05.115 --> 02:42:06.383
CITY'S PARKING IT IS NOT A

02:42:06.450 --> 02:42:08.418
