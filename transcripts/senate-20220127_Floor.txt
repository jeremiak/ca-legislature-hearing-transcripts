TO REPORT SERVICES PROVIDED VIA THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN PORTAL THAT IS CREATED ON MEMBERS WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GRANTS. EXTRA FUNDS FOR THESE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT THE FUNDS ARE NOT BEING USED. TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE STUDENTS FOR WHICH THEY WERE GRANTED AND INSTEAD MANY OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SWEEPING THE MONEY INTO THEIR GENERAL FUND AND USING IT FOR GENERAL PURPOSES BAD WAS NOT WITH THE MONEY WASN'T INTENDED TO DO. AND WE'VE TRIED TO PUT- YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT ARE. THE COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASSEMBLY NOW SECRETARY OF STATE WEBER. RAN A SERIES OF BILLS TO FORCE ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE USE OF THESE FUNDS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY THIS WILL REQUIRE THE REPORTING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THOSE FUNDS SO THAT WE CAN COMPARE DISTRICT TO DISTRICT.

THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE I ALSO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT IS A PROUD FATHER TO THIS BILL. AS THE AUTHOR STATED TIME WITH SUCH LARGE INVESTMENTS IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT IS REALLY IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. WITHIN THESE FUNDS AND THAT THE MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THE STUDENTS THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO HELP- I WE RECOGNIZE THAT SCHOOLS ARE STRUGGLING SO THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE BUT IF THE FUNDING WAS MEANT TO SUPPORT THESE VULNERABLE STUDENTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT THE FUNDING GOES. AND SO I ALSO I JUST WANT TO COME AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS SOMETIMES TO TRACK THIS FUNDING AND SO WITH THIS BILL AGES WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR NOT ONLY ADMINISTRATORS TEACHERS AND OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO UNDERSTAND BUT IT WILL DEFINITELY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND WITH THAT I ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU. ZERO WE'RE GONNA STICK TO KEEP DECIDE CHARTED. SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I ALSO ON A RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I THINK THIS KIND OF- OVER COUNT IN THE AND LETTING THE PUBLIC AND ALL OF US KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL EVEN IN THESE VERY KIND OF THE VISIT TIMES WHERE WE HAVE A WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF CONFLICT IS HAPPENING AT OUR LOCAL LEVELS IN OUR SCHOOL BOARDS AND LYFT. THE SCHOOL BOARDS ARE ARE JUST A PLACE OF DEMOCRACY NOW LIKE WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND ALLOW DECISIONS GET MADE ABOUT ABOUT OUR OUR CHILDREN AND THE AND THEIR EDUCATION WE CAN HAVE ALL THE GOOD IDEAS AS WE WANT ABOUT PUTTING AS MUCH RESOURCES DOWN TO THE LOCALS AS WE WANT BUT IF THAT NOT MONEY IS NOT BEING GOING OUT TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE STUDENTS LIVES AND EDUCATIONS THAN THE MORE DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT. SO I WANT TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND IS MUCH OF OVER CAT AND THIS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IS WE CAN BUILD INTO OUR GOVERNMENT THE MORE WE CAN AGREE ON ON WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO MAKE SURE KIDS GET EVERYTHING THEY NEED SO THANKING THE SENATOR FOR THIS AND RISING IN SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY THE DESCRIPTION.
