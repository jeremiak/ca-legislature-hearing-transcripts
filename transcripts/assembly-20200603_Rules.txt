BUT IF YOU WANT IT WAS TO SPEAK TO IT MISTER CHARLES I CAN'T MISTER ALMOST AS AN TO OPEN IT UP FOR THIS. OKAY OKAY MISTER AT ALL RIGHT TO GO INTO YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF I DID PULL ACA SIXTEEN I THINK. YOU KNOW WITH THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED- HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THE COVE IT AND THEN WE SEE A LOT OF THE PROTESTS GOING ON. THIS CERTAINLY WE ARE. LOOKING AT BILLS THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND BEING REFERRED- HOWEVER THIS IS A BILL THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT. THE IMPACTS THAT IT HAS HAS ON TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTYHAS ON ON STATE COMPACTS. HAS ON DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD. WE SEE A CA SIXTEEN AND IS CURRENT FORM WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE MORE TOWARDS THE END SO THIS IS A BILL THAT THAT REALLY HAS SERIOUS- A FAX HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE TRULY WARRANT SOME MORE DISCUSSION- TO MOVE FORWARD HOWEVER UNDERSTANDING. THE PROCESS AND WE'RE IN NOW. THE THAT DISCUSSION DOES NEED TO MOVE FORWARD- SO THAT ALL VOICES ARE BEING HEARD. THOSE THAT ARE RAISING OPPOSITION TO THIS. BUT I THINK WE'RE SITTING HERE TODAY AND BRINGING ATTENTION TO IT BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS IN THE SPEEDING THIS THAT WHICH IT SHOWED UP IN IS MOVING FORWARD. SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT MY COLLEAGUES TRULY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS COMPONENTS DEALING WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY THERE'S COMPONENTS DEALING WITH A STATE COMPACT THERE'S COMPONENTS DEALING WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD ASK- I KNOW THE AUTHOR TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE THAT DISCUSSION- MOVING FOR WITH ALL THOSE THAT WE JUST- ALLUDED TO. BECAUSE BY NO MEANS. SUPPORTING THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD TODAY DOES BY NO MEANS MEAN THAT I WILL BE IN SUPPORT OF IT ON THE FLOOR UNLESS THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS START TO TAKE PLACE AND HAS MEANING FULL MUTUAL RESPECTFUL. DIALOG HAPPENING. THAT'S WHY I PULLED A CA SIXTEEN- MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN IT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT MY COLLEAGUES TRULY UNDERSTOOD THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR GOOD. ON THE MS QUIRK SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I WANTED TO SPEAK TO- ACA SIXTEEN JUST IN GENERAL BUT IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THE BILL FORWARD. IN BILLS BEING HEARD AND NOT FOR ONE OF THE THINGS OVER THE LAST HANDFUL YOU OF YEARS- AND AGAIN- IN RULES WE MOVED BILLS INTO. THE DESIGNATED COMMITTEE THAT THE CHAIR HAS DECIDED WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE PLACE SOMETIMES TO COMMITTEES. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT- IS ONE BILLS ARE NOT HEARD AT ALL BY THE CHAIR. AND I JUST WANTED TO GO ON RECORD AS I HAVE WITH A COLLEAGUE- FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE JOE JAY OBERNOLTE WHERE WE WROTE ABOUT. WE FEEL THAT IF WE ARE ELECTED. AS A WHOLE THAT ARE BILL SHOULD BE HEARD WHETHER BE BY DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN BECAUSE- WHEN WE DON'T HEAR BILLS AND A CHAIR IS ABLE I KNOW THAT'S BEEN PART OF THE SPEAKERS- LEADERSHIP. BUT WE'RE ALL ELECTED IN OUR DISTRICTS AND WHEN IT CHAIR HAS OPPORTUNITY JUST TO SAY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR BEAR THEIR OF CERTAIN BILLS OR SOME BILLS. IT REALLY DIMINISHES THE ROLE WE CAN PLAY SO I JUST WANT TO- EXPRESS THAT PUBLICLY THAT WE SHOULD BE HEARING BILLS THAT MEMBERS BRING FORWARD. AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OF THAT AND TO HAVE CRITICAL DISCUSSIONS HOUSE MISTER RAMOS IS SAID BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS. ON MAJOR ISSUES THAT AFFECT MANY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. FOR THAT MR LIVING. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN ECHO- THE CONCERNS AND COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES I'M REALLY GRATEFUL. TO THEM FOR RAISING THOSE ISSUES I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK. SUBSTANTIVELY TO THE BILL- THOUGH I'D HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT IT- I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE HEARD. IN POLICY COMMITTEE I'M HOPEFUL THAT IN POLICY COMMITTEE IS GIVEN A FULL. VETTING AND FULLY TALK THROUGH THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF IT. THIS IS THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT. THIS IS THE COMMITTEE WHERE- WE ALLOW IT TO GET HEARD AND- IN AGAIN TO ECHO- THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. I BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE WE HAVE OF ALLOWING CHAIRS TO NOT HEAR A BILL- SHOWS EIGHTY EIGHTY CURRENT MORAL BANKRUPTCY ABOUT THE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THAT WE HAVE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IT IS WRONG AND- AND THAT IS THE ONLY REASON WHY I'M GOING TO VOTE HI TO ALLOW THIS BILL TO BE HEARD. THANK YOU. IS THERE A MOTION TO REFER THIS ACA SIXTEEN TO THE GEO COMMITTEE. SOME OF MOVED. ASYLUM MEMBERS RAMOS TO REVERSE SECOND ROOM IS CARILLO MATTER SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL COOLEY HI. COOLEY I AND I'M SURE THIS IS ON THE REFERRAL OF ACA SIXTEEN TO GEO AND APPROPRIATIONS- COOLEY AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM I. CARILLO. CORREO AYE FLORA FLORA AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE MAIENSCHEIN MATHIS MATHIS AYE AYE QUIRK SILVA AND QUIRK SILVA I RAMOS I. ALMOST I RIVAS RIVAS AYE LEVINE LEVINE I THOUGHT MOTION PASSAGE. VERY GOOD- ISSUE SIXTEEN IS REFER TO THE GEO COMMITTEE AND- WE'LL NOW GO TO HIGHLAND TO ON A REGULAR AGENDA A SHEET TWENTY FIVE BY SELLING MEMBER MOLEN- SUMMER MORE WOULD YOU LIKE 2% ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU WENDY. I'M VERY SORRY FOR. THIS MORNING MY OPEN ON THE MEASURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU A TRULY BIPARTISAN BILL THAT IS LONG OVERDUE. I HAVE DISTRIBUTED AMENDMENTS THAT SHOULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION WE HAVE DELETED THE ENTIRE SECTION THAT ALLOWS FOR ANY WAIVER OF PROVISIONS OF PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR. IN ADDITION I'M ADDING LIKE WHICH INDICATE THAT REMOTE VOTING SHALL ONLY APPLY WHEN MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE PREVENTED FROM SAFELY ATTENDING IN PERSON. HERE IN THIS BUILDING WITH THAT I BELIEVE WE HAVE ADDRESSED CONCERNS WHICH CAME TO OUR ATTENTION IN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS. CALIFORNIA AS YOU ALL KNOW IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WITH A POPULATION OF FORTY MILLION WE HAVE A FULL TIME LEGISLATURE WHICH UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IS ABLE TO FAIRLY NIMBLY A RESPOND BY PASSING URGENCY LEGISLATION AND IT JUST SPENDING PRIORITIES IN REAL TIME. WHEN CONDITIONS WARRANT. HOWEVER IT TOOK EIGHT WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC PRESS TO DISCOVER THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT IS UNPREPARED TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION DURING SUCH A WIDESPREAD DISRUPTIVE EMERGENCY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS NO CURRENT AUTHORITY TO ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT. THAT IS FOR THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO CONVENE DURING AN EMERGENCY IT DECLARED EMERGENCY BY THE GOVERNOR OR THE PRESIDENT WHERE AND IT WOULD BE UNSAFE FOR MEMBERS TO GATHER AND MEET IN PERSON. ACA TWENTY FIVE SIX TO PUT BEFORE THE VOTERS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. THAT WOULD REQUIRE BOTH HOUSES OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT RULES WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR THE SWORN DUTIES OF THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE AND TO REQUIRE SUCH RULES TO PROVIDE FOR AND MAINTAIN MAXIMUM TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESS BY THE PUBLIC. WHILE MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THE IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN HAS SHOWN US THAT THERE ARE A WIDE RANGE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO ACCESS COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND FLOOR SESSION AND I BELIEVE THESE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BECOME EVEN MORE ACCESSIBLE MOVING FORWARD ACA TWENTY FIVE PRESERVES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO A COURT CHALLENGE IF THEY FEEL YOUR LATER ACTED CONSISTENT. WITH THE TERMS OF THE AMENDMENT. IN TWO STATES OR AGAIN AND WISCONSIN SPECIFIC CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT PROVISIONS ALLOW FOR THE REMOTE MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE. FROM MARCH THROUGH MAY TWENTY TWENTY LEGISLATURE'S- CHAMBERS AND AT LEAST TWENTY STATES RED AND BLUE STATES. CHANGE THEIR PROCEDURES TO ALLOW FOR REMOTE PARTICIPATION OR VOTING AND FLOOR SESSION. OR COMMITTEE MEETINGS. CALIFORNIA IS SEEKING TO DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY BY ASKING ARE VOTERS TO APPROVE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. TO ALLOW WHAT TWENTY STATES ARE ALREADY DOING BY DECREE. THE LEGISLATURE IS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT BUT BETWEEN OUR DEPARTURE FROM THE CAPITAL TO AN EARLY KOBE DRIVEN SPRING RECESS AND ARE RETURNED EARLIER THIS MONTH. THE GOVERNOR ISSUED THIRTY EXECUTIVE ORDERS MOST OF WHICH I AGREE WITH AND I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR. A DESPITE SOME OF THE VERY LATE NOTICE- IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT NONE THE LESS THE LEGISLATURE MUST CONTINUE ITS OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS AND MAINTAIN CHECKS AND BALANCES EVEN IN THE TIME OF AN EMERGENCY. GOVERNMENT BY EXECUTIVE FIAT IS NOT WHAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS HAD IN MIND WHEN ESTABLISHING THREE SEPARATE CO EQUAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER MALONE WILL NOW GO TO WITNESSES AND WE HAVE NO KEY WITNESSES LISTEN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES TO SUPPORT IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NONE OF THE FIRST WANT TO INVITE THE MODERATOR TO PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF ACA TWENTY FIVE. AND ARE YOU WITH US MODERATOR. I AM AT YOUR AND THE POOREST ONE ZERO AT THAT TIME. WELL THAT ISUNFOLDING- DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OUR MODERATOR. WE'VE GOT ADELINE EIGHT UP MY MOM AND. THE. RIGHT BOTTOM LINE EIGHT CALLAHAN. GOOD AFTERNOON PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND- PROVIDE YOUR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF A CA TWENTY FIVE. LINE SIXTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS STEVE EDGAR AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND I SUPPORT THIS. BUILT THANK YOU MISTER EDGAR. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MAXWELL BUT A LINE EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN. IF. AT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT CONNECTED. THERE'S NO ONE OUT TO MAKE YOU NO ONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM MODERATOR- WILL TURN OUT TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OUR FIRST WITNESS WILL BE DOMINIC TOMARI- MR TOMORROW THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HERE IN THIS CHAMBERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOMINIC TOMORROW AND I'M HERE IN MY CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT. OF THE INSTITUTE OF GOVERNMENTAL ADVOCATES OR AYE JAYE HERE IN SACRAMENTO REPRESENTING. LOBBYISTS AND ADVOCATES IN TOWN. BEFORE YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND IN GENERAL- WE ARE OPPOSED TO A SU TWENTY FIVE. AND WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT REMOVE SOME OF THE MORE OBJECTIONABLE PARTS. RELATIVE TO TELEVISING PUBLIC ACCESS HOWEVER I THINK THAT WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE. IN TERMS OF HOW E VIEW THE ROLE OF THIS INSTITUTION AND WHERE IT SHOULD BE DOING ITS BUSINESS. I WILL SPEAK FIRST AS AN ADVOCATE AND ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES WE'VE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR FILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS TO THE- TO THE CLIENTS IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE REPRESENT. UNDER THE PANDEMIC AND SO WE DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A BALANCE THAT NEEDS TO BE REACHED BETWEEN PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND CONDUCTING THE BUSINESS OF THE STATE. BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE STATE AND OF THIS INSTITUTION. STATE YOUR IS ACT TO THE- TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUR PROCEEDINGS IN YOUR DOUBLE THE DELIBERATIONS. IN THE OPENING DAY LIFE IN THE TRANSPARENCY. NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS IS WHAT MAKES THE DEMOCRACY WORK. AND TOO WHEN YOU. AND YOU REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC TO BEAR WITNESS TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE PUBLIC TO HAVE THE CONTINUED CONFIDENCE IN THE RESULTS THAT YOU PRODUCED HERE. AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE TO BE GOING DOWN. AGAIN RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO BALANCE PUBLIC SAFETY AND PERSONAL SAFETY AGAINST THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND SPEAKING AS A CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA I SHARE THE SAME VIEWS AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES DO AS WELL. AND FOR US THE LEGISLATURE IS THESE A SYMBOL OF THE GOVERNMENT. YOU HAVE THE EXECUTIVE AND MISTER MULLIN SPOKE VERY WELL OF. THE EXECUTIVE POWER AND THE USE OF THAT EXECUTIVE POWER OVER THESE LAST FEW MONTHS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT IN ADVANCE YOUR BACK AND THAT'S A GREAT THING FROM THE BALANCE OF POWER POINT OF VIEW. BUT THE ISSUE IS THIS BUILDING THIS-CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE LEGISLATURE IN GOVERNMENT. AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS LIKE WE ARE NOW THE PANDEMIC NO ONE COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT. THE CIVIL UNREST AND WE SEE VERY IN THE STREETS AROUND OUR STATE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY. THIS MOMENT. NO WHATEVER COULD HAVE PREDICTED A PANDEMIC. AND THE CIVIL UNREST THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIANS LOOK TO YOU. IN THIS ROOM IN THIS BUILDING FOR LEADERSHIP THIS BUILDING IS THE SYMBOL OF THAT LEADERSHIP. AND WHEN YOU LEAVE YOU NEED TO LEAVE FROM HERE. THIS IS WHERE YOU BELONG. AND SO FOR OUR POINT OF VIEW AS PROFESSIONALS YES WE'VE ENTERED A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. WE WILL WISH TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER IN THE FUTURE. FROM THE LARGER POINT OF VIEW OF GOVERNANCE AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE ALL HAVE TO OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS A BAD IDEA AND THAT THE MINUTE WE START REMOVING OURSELVES TO OUR LIBRARIES IN GOVERNING OVER ASSUME CALL. THAT THAT'S A BAD TURN FOR US SO. I WOULD ASK THAT THIS. BODY THIS COMMITTEE. VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE LET'S GO BACK LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT ISN'T AS BROAD AND I WILL END WITH THIS ON A TECHNICAL NOTE. IN HERE AND I APPRECIATE AGAIN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE BUT I KNOW THAT THE REMOTE METHODS AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL ONLY BE UTILIZED WHEN A STATE OF EMERGENCY PREVENTS. ANY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM SAFELY ATTENDING A LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDING A PERSON DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF ONE OF YOU IN THIS ROOM ARE PREVENTED FROM. ATTENDING THIS PROCEEDING A PERSON THAT THE ENTIRE PROCEEDINGS CANCELED OR THAT THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE AND LEGISLATE REMOTELY. WE NEED MORE. TIME TO DISCUSS AND WORK OUT THE DETAILS AROUND HOW THIS CAN BE DONE. BUT NO THIS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE. THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE TAKING BECAUSE- THE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOU FOLKS HERE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS IS TO BE HERE. AND TO LEGISLATE SO WITH THAT I HUMBLY AND RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT OUR OPPOSITION ON BEHALF OF I. GA AND OTHERS AROUND TOWN THANK YOU SO MUCH. MORE RESPECT FOR. LET US TURN THIS TIME WHEN THEY WITNESSES PHONE LINE THOSE OPPOSITION- ABOUT A MODERATOR WE HAVE GOT THE TROLLS NUMBER. FOR RIGHT I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HERE YOU DID YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO GO TO THOSE IN OPPOSITION HEARD ME I HAD THANK YOU- YES GOOD THE OPPOSITION DOCTOR CHARLES MUNGER OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HONORABLE MEMBERS I'M PARTICIPATING BY TELEPHONE INSIDE WE STAFF FOR TWO POINTS OF CLARIFICATION. OF THE HONORABLE MEMBER OF SUBMITTED A SET OF THE NINE MONTHS TO- ACA TWENTY FIVE I'M ASKING ONE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE IDENTICAL TO THE ONE WHICH I WAS- SENT BY- THE EIGHT. THIRTY FOR STAFF. OF THE COMMITTEE AND I ALSO WISH TO ASK- IF THOSE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN DULY ADOPTED OR BY THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE I PROCEED TO MY REMARKS AND BE HELPFUL NOT TO ATTACK. SOMETHING WHICH IS NO LONGER IN THE BILL. YEAH DAYS. DR MARGARET THIS IS ASSEMBLYMEMBERCOOLEY. SO THE AMENDMENT STRIKE SECTION THREE AND FOUR- AB AND C. ON PAGE THREE. I HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME AND INSERT THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE ADDED REMOTE METHODS AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO SECTION SHALL ONLY BE UTILIZED. IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY PREVENTS ANY NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM SAFEETERNITY LET'S SAY PROCEED IN PERSON- ANY ACTION ON THIS BILL WILL BE AND- TO ADOPTING THESE AMENDMENTS- SO THAT IS THE BILL BEFORE SIR. AS AMENDED. THANK YOU SIR AND I'D LIKE TO BE I MAY PLEASE CONTINUE AYE LETTER YEAH PLEASE CONTINUE CERTAINLY. I'M THINKING YOU MAKING TO YOU TODAY AS ONE OF THE TWO PROPONENTS OF- PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR WHICH ESTABLISHED THE PROVISIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHICH THE- NOW REMOVED SECTIONS OF EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY FIVE WHAT AFFECTED I HAD MANY OBJECTIONS TO THOSE BUTTONS ARE NO LONGER IN THE BILL I DON'T HAVE THOSE OBJECTIONS- ON THE GENERAL SUBJECT OF THIS BILL- TO PREVIOUS SPEAKER HAS ALLUDED TO. ON THE COMPLICATED ISSUES. LACKEY VOTING IS APPROPRIATE TIME WITH THE REMOTE VOTING AS APPROPRIATE DELIVERY COMPLICATED ISSUES BUT THEY'RE NOT ISSUES ON WHICH I'D SAY- THAT'S A PROPONENT OF THE TRANSPARENCY MEASURE HAD ANY PARTICULAR SAY PROVIDED INDEED THAT. THE MEASURE THE CONDUCTED WITH DUE REGARD TO BE COPIED REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSPARENCY AND DON'T UNDERMINE THE- SO I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING AS THIS BILL MOVES FOR THE LEGISLATURE- TO. AVOID ANY PROBLEMS I THANK THE HONORABLE AUTHOR AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR BEING VERY RESPONSIVE TO. MY CONCERNS AND THE CONCERNS OF THE WELL NIGH TWO THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO APPROVED PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR. AND I THINK THAT- THE FACT THAT WE'RE ON THE TELEPHONE CALL TODAY AND THAT THIS WILL BECOME PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD IT'S HIGHLY DESIRABLE. AND I LIKE YOU WELCOME BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ARGUMENT I BRING HER FAILED TO BRING THE DELIBERATIONS ASSEMBLY. AND WHAT THAT. I HAVE NO FURTHER REMARKS TO MAKE ALTHOUGH I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS WHICH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY WISH TO ASK ABOUT HOW. BILL CONTINUES TO FIGHT CONTINUE TO AFFECT GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY OR PROPOSITION FOR. THANK YOU UNLESS YOU TO STAY ON THE LINE. DR MUNGER AND OF COURSE YOUR LETTER OF OPPOSITION IS A PART OF THE- RECORD AS WELL SO THAT CAME IN. PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN OUR RECORD. OF THE- AND IF YOU'LL JUST KEEP YOUR LINE OPEN WE WILL. TURN OUT TO THE OTHER. OF MRS AND THEN THERE MAY BE AFTER ALL MAY INDEED HAVE QUESTIONS. IF THAT'S AGREEABLE. SO MARILYN. THAT'S AGREEABLE. ENTIRELY VERY GOOD THEN LET'S OPEN THE LINE OF MATTER MODERATOR FOR SENATOR BLAKESLEE. YES THANK YOU BYE CHAIR COOLEY A VICE CHAIR CUNNINGHAM AND NUMBERS MY NAME A SAMPLE EXPLAINED I PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN THIS BODY AND HELD ROLES SUCH A VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND MINORITY LEADER LATER CERTAIN STATE SENATE SO MY INTEREST IN HOW THIS A BODY OPERATE VERY DEEPLY HELD A AND IN FACT LEADING THE LEGISLATURE. I'VE GONE ON TO WORK ON GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY AND SERVE AS FOUNDINGDIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC POLICY. WHERE FACULTY ENOUGH WE GOT PLATFORM BY NAME OF THE DIVIDE BUT MANY VIEW MAY HAVE YOU. AT PRIVILEGE OF WORKING DOCTOR MUNGER AS CO AUTHOR AND CO PROPONENT OF PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR WHICH IMPLEMENTED THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR IMPRINT REQUIREMENT. AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE VICE CHAIR. OF THE BOARD ON THE BOARD OF COMMON CAUSE CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE AND I WILL NOTE. THAT EVERYONE. WHO SERVED ON THE STATE SIDE SIXTY FIVE COMMISSION. WHICH IS GOOD TO GO. YEAH WELL AND I AM- NOT A I AM A FORMER SCIENTIST AND YOU KNOW I CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT AND- ISSUES THAT PERTAIN TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY SO THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT. I KNOW THAT EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE YOUR BELIEFS AND THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF OPEN GOVERNMENT ONE THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS MUST BE CONDUCTED IN PUBLIC CHOOSE THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN MEETINGS A THREE THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS PUBLIC DOCUMENTS. WHICH FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES WERE ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE- AS THEY APPLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE BROWN ACT TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO BACK WE CAME OPEN MEETINGS ACT. FOR ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH DOCUMENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. AND EVEN ON THE COURTS. THE SUN SHINES OUT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR. WHICH DIRECTION THAT ALSO SAW SHOULD BE QUOTE. BROADLY CONSTRUED BURGERS WITH PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO ACCESS AND NARROWLY CONSTRUED IT LIMITS THE WHITE OF ACCESS UNQUOTE. NOW ALL THESE ACTS WERE WRITTEN BY THE LEGISLATURE IN ALL EMPLOYMENT OPEN GOVERNMENT PRINCIPLES ON EVERY BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT STATE ONE. AND COINCIDENTALLY ENOUGH THE LEGISLATURE IS THE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT- WHICH IS EXEMPT FROM THESE- STATUTES AND CONSTITUTIONAL NUMBERS WHICH I MENTIONED. EE THE LEGISLATURE HAS A HISTORY OF NOT DOING A PARTICULARLY GOOD JOB WHEN IT COMES TO LEGISLATING SUCH MATTERS THAT GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF THE BODY. THE LEGISLATIVE OPEN RECORDS ACT IS NOW WIDELY VIEWED AS THE OXY MORON. IN ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE WHAT THE SUNSHINE ACT. IT ADDED A FINAL PARAGRAPH BELIEVE THAT NIGHT THAT EXEMPTED THE QUOTE PROCEEDINGS AND RECORDS OF THE LEGISLATURE UNQUOTE. NOW IS WORTH CONSIDERING THE ADVERSE ALSO A PUBLIC POLICY CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH CARVE OUT BECAUSE THAT FEEDBACK ALSO INCLUDED ANOTHER EXEMPTION QUOTE. ON THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING THE OFFICIAL PERFORMANCE OF A PEACE OFFICER. UNQUOTE DURING THE STORAGE REPORT PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS WHICH IS HAPPENING DURING THE HELP RIGHT THAT JUST WANTED TO BE EXTREMELY MIND ON CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT THE LONG TERM TO SEND THE CONSEQUENCES OF WEAKENING THE PUBLIC SUNSHINE LAWS. AND THEREFORE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE THE PUBLIC IN THE PRESS TO EXAMINE THE FOLLOWING SIX QUESTIONS REGARDING A CA TWENTY FIVE. ONE WHY SHOULDN'T BELONG TO THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT. RIGHT AUTOMATICALLY SUNSET EVERY SIXTY DAYS WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF PRE AUTHORIZATION RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE LEGISLATURE TO ROUND IT DECLAING IT AND TO THE EMERGENCY. TO WHY SHOULD THE PROVISIONS FOR REMOTE LEGISLATOR PARTICIPATION THE LIMITED STRICTLY TO THOSE LEGISLATORS ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE MARCH IT. THREE WHY SHOULDN'T THE LEGISLATION THAT PASSED WITHOUT THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO PLACE TO BE IMITED TO ONLY THOSE POLICY AND BUDGET ISSUES THAT PERTAIN TO THE OPERATION OF THE STATE DURING THE EMERGENCE BUT- FOR. WHY SHOULD THE LAWS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED DURING AN EMERGENCY. AUTOMATICALLY SUNSET AND REQUIRE RE AUTHORIZATION ONCE EMERGENCY IS OVER AND THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT YOU'RE FULLY REINSTATED. FIVE WHY SHOULDN'T LEGISLATORS WHO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY HE RECORDED THE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT THEIR OFFICIAL DUTIES IN A PUBLICLY VIEWABLE MATTER TO ALL COUNTRIES. THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND LOBBYISTS ARE NOT SITTING IN THE ROOM WITH THEM WHILE THEY VOTE. SIX WHY SHOULDN'T THE LEGISLATURE RATHER THAN THE PUBLIC. THE LEGAL BURDEN OF PROVING THAT ANY ADOPTED RULES FOR NECESSARY. IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER THAT MINIMIZE THE LOSS OF THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT. I RAISE pTHE SIX QUESTIONS BECAUSE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. EIGHT TWENTY FIVE PROVIDES NEAR BREATHTAKING LATITUDE TO ANY FUTURE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS ANYWAY IT CHOOSES TO. AND THEY DO SO NOT BY PASSING A BILL BY SIMPLY MAKING A WILL. NO INCLUSION OF IRISH BODY LEGISLATE OPEN GOVERNMENT ISSUES USING THE HIPPOCRATIC OF. PROMISE OF FIRST DO NO HARM. WITH WEATHERBLINK AC TWENTY FIVE DOES NOT USE A SCALPEL TO ACHIEVE IT SOUNDS RATHER IT PUT THE MEAT AXE IN THE HANDS OF. LEGISLATURE'S POTENTIALLY DISMEMBER THE PUBLIC'S CURRENT OPEN GOVERNMENT BY. THE PUBLIC OPEN GOVERNMENT RIGHTS. SO I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT HE HAD OFFERED I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR THE AUTHORED BACK TO HAVE THE DISTINCT PROBLEMS OF SERVING- WITH HIS FATHER REMEMBER REMEMBER THOSE TIMES WITH GREAT FONDNESS BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT. IF I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BODY WILL HAVE BUT ONE POLICY HEARING. THAT A THIRTY DAY INCREDIBLE WAS WAIVED. THAT WERE LITERALLY SAYING A NUMBER MINUTES BEFORE THE HEARING. AND AS I READ A THE AMENDMENTS I HAVE TO ECHO- MISTER DEMERITS CONCERNS THAT THEY IN FACT HAVE SUFFICIENT AMBIGUITY THAT THEY MAY NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THIS HEARING. SO WITH THAT I URGE THE MEMBERS EITHER VOTE NO FOR YOUR BRING IT BACK FOR SECOND HEARING WHERE OPEN GOVERNMENT PARTIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE OR AND THE AUTHORS. TO MAKE SURE THESE ISSUES AND QUESTIONS ARE DRESSED IN A MANNER THAT ARE PROTECTIVE OF THE PUBLIC'S WHITE. TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU CENTER BLAKESLEE. AT THIS TIME. WE'RE GONNA TURN TWO OPPONENTS IN THE ROOM. WHO WISH TO TESTIFY AND FIGHT YOU FORWARD. THANK YOU MY NAME IS KATHERINE BRANDON BURKE AND I'M ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF IDA BUT I'M SPEAKING FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE HERE. I-THINK WHAT ALL THE MEMBERS NEED TO REALLY CONSIDER WHEN ADDRESSING THIS BILL. IS THERE ARE MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO. THEY COME HERE. TO THIS BUILDING TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS WE SEE THEM ALL THE TIME AS LOBBYIST WE SAVE YOU SEE THEM IN THE HOUSE AND LIKE US. YEAH THE ORANGE SHIRT HERE THE YELLOW SHIRT SO HERE YOU KNOW THEY THEY DO COME AND THEY WANT TO BE HEARD. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT HERE IN THIS BUILDING. WHERE THEY GOING TO GO TO VOICE OUR CONCERNS ON CERTAIN ISSUES. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THIS THAT YOU TAKE EVERYONE INTO ACCOUNT. THAT YOU KNOW WHAT. FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIKELY STATED WHAT MR TOMARI STATED. I COMPLETELY AGREE WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOW THIS BODY. WANTS TO TAKE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WITHTHAT- AS DRAFTED I DO OPPOSE THANK YOU VERY GOOD KATHERINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CANNON WELCOME THANK YOU. YEAH MY NAME'S DAN MCKINNON- CONSTITUENT OF CAN COOLEY IS AND I AM I CAME TODAY TO VOICE MY OPPOSITION TO THIS AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION I'M KINDERGARTEN TEACHER FOR TWELVE YEARS. AND MAYBE A PERSPECTIVE THAT I CAN BRING- SPENDING ALL MY DAYS WITH FIVE AND SIX YEAR OLD AT. THE WAY WE COME TO RESOLVE CONFLICT AND MOVE FORWARD HEALTH BILLY IS- IN PERSON. IT INVOLVES I CONTACT IT INVOLVES HUMAN CONNECTION. AND WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH HOW ARE WE GOING TO TEACH KINDERGARTEN IN THE FALL AND I KNOW THAT SIMPLY CANNOT BE DONE OVER ZOOM. I KNOW THAT IT CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT TOUCH WITHOUT SEEING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. AND I'M NOT SURE HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE GOVERNMENT WHERE WE CAN LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE. WHERE WE CAN HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT DECISIONS WERE MADE. BY HUMANS IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER AND SO I'M ASKING ARE WE REALLY ARE WE REALLY AND SO MUCH FEAR. THEY WERE GONNA FORGO THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN THE DIRECTION OF THIS NATION AND YES I DO THINK THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS AMENDMENT COULD PROFOUNDLY AFFECT. HOW DECISIONS ARE MADE I REALLY CALL INTO QUESTION THAT IT'S EVEN BEING MADE AT THIS TIME. RIGHT NOW IF YOU WANT THE COMPETENCE OF THE PUBLIC IN A DECISION LIKE THIS. THEN WAIT UNTIL THE ACCESS IS NOT BEEN LIMITED TO WERE NOT SOCIAL DISTANCING. I STAND IN OPPOSITION VERY GOOD THANK YOU MUCH FOR CANADA. HE SAID FROM WELCOME. I GOT MY NAME RIGHT HEADS FROM THAT'S RIGHT I AM MARRIED TO THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER WHO JUST SPOKE AND JUST AS A PLUG ON HIS BEHALF- I WILL SAY I RESPECT WHAT HE DOES ON ANY GIVEN DAY FAR MORE THAN WHAT ANY OF YOU DO FOR WHATEVER THAT'S WORTH BECAUSE THE FUTURE REALLY IS. IN THE CHILDREN. SO I CAME UP HERE NOT KNOWING WHAT I WOULD SAY OTHER THAN I AM VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED TO THIS. HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DEVICE HERE THAT'S NOT REALLY. MY PREFERRED- WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD THIS COMPUTER- I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN I'M A GOAT FARMER. SO I MIGHT USE THIS AS A BIT OF A CRUTCH. BUT I'M GONNA TALK FOR A MOMENT JUST OFF THE FLY BECAUSE AS I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE AND LISTENING TO THIS AMAZING TESTIMONY BY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE WHOSE NAME I DIDN'T. CATCH AND THE FELLOW WHO PHONED IN- WHAT IS COMING TO MY MIND IS THAT DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU THE LEGISLATURE HAS GOTTEN A TASTE. OF WHAT WE CONSTITUENTS USUALLY DEAL WITH FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SHUT YOU OUT OF THE PROCESS. AND THAT'S WHAT THE PUBLIC TYPICALLY FEELS FROM THIS LEGISLATURE AND SO THIS RUNAWAY TRAIN THAT IS THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT IS WHAT FORTY EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT CHANGE TWO HUNDRED LAWS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A FLAVOR OF WHAT WE- THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. EXPERIENCE HERE IN THIS BUILDING FROM YOU YOU WHO ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS YOU ARE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT US YOU OR WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO HEAR OUR VOICES. AND WE'RE BEING SHOT OUT AND NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS TRAIN TO THE NEXT LEVEL. YOU WANT TO MAKE THESE CHANGES IN SECRET IN THE DARK. AND WE'RE SAYING WAIT THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO US ALL THIS TIME WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THESE LAWS. AND SO NOW YOU HAVE A TASTE OF IT SO INSTEAD OF REINING IN THIS GOVERNOR WHO'S RUN A MUCK YOU WANT TO SADDLE UP TO THE TO THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.

THERE'S NO ONE LIKE YOU ALL RIGHT WE CLOSE THAT LINE. NOW RIGHT ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. MR MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS. EIGHT OUT A LOT OF CONCERNS. AND FRANKLY I STILL DO. BUT WHEN I SIT HERE. AND I DIGEST THIS I THINK ABOUT THIS AND I THINK ABOUT THE MASSIVE EXECUTIVE POWER. THAT OUR GOVERNOR HAS DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND HOW WOMEN DID THE POWER. OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE BODIES BECOME DURING THOSE TIMES WHICH WE DON'T GET TO CALL THE GOVERNOR GETS TO CALL. SO WE WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THIS HOW DO WE BALANCE THIS POWER ROUTE. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT. THOSE OF US THAT THAT ARE ELECTED AND I THINK ABOUT THE HOW CRAZY IT IS. AMBER'S IN L. A. AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE REPRESENT. JUST UNDER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE THAT THAT'S MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR OF MISSOURI. SO THIS MORE THAN A GOVERNOR OF A LOT OF THE STATES THAT THAT ARE AROUND US AND- TO THINK ABOUT THAT AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY. AND TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. OVER THE ABILITY OF A GOVERNOR TO JUST ONE WITH A PEN. AND CHANGE THAT TO GO RIGHT PAST THE LEGISLATIVE BODY IN AND FRANKLY DO WHATEVER THE HELL HE WANTS. AND THEN I LOOK AT THIS AND GO. IF FOR SOME UNGODLY REASON THIS HAPPENS AGAIN. I DON'T WANT TO BE STUCK ON THE SIDELINES. WATCHING ON THE NEWS. THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN ANOTHER ORDER WELL WHAT SENATE WALL THERE GONNA COME OUT WITH DETAILS LATER IN THE WEEK. IT IS MY HOPE. EXPRESSLY TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER MULLIN HOOCH HEADING THIS UP. THIS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO REAL IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO REAL IN THE BUREAUCRATS THAT THE FRANKLY TEND IGNORE EVERY THING WE TRY TO GET THEM TO DO- BECAUSE THEY TEND TO INTERPRET THINGS HOW THEY WANT. IN RESTORE SOME OF THAT POWER BACK TO THE LEGISLATORS I DO HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY SIDE OF IT. BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO OUR PUBLIC AND WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT IN FOR THE PUBLIC. IF WE'RE NOT RECALLS MAY ONE THOUSAND. ONE SPEAK TO THAT SO I THINK WITH THAT. I I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS TODAY MOVING FORWARD. NOT SURE HOW MANY VOTE ON IT. ON THE FLOOR THE ASPECT THAT THIS GOAL SUCH POTENTIALLY ON THE BALLOT WHERE PEOPLE CAN HAVE MORE TIME TO READ IT TO UNDERSTAND IT. TO SEE HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT TO TAKE THE POWER AWAY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AND GIVE THE POWER TO THE PEOPLE TO VOTE ON IT. I THINK IS IMPORTANT. IS THAT A MOTION ON THE BILL OF PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THE AMENDMENT CENTER BEFORE SIDE. YEAH ALL ALL MAKE THAT MOTION. BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THE AUTHOR HAS TO SAY ON THIS I'VE NOTICED SHE'S BEEN TAKING COPIOUS NOTES- I THINK WE ALL HAVE CONCERNS OKAY MISTER MULLIN WILL USE PLEASE I THINK WE WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE. OUR AT. ALL UP. MISTER CHAIR I GET A DRESS ANOTHER A NUMBER OF ISSUES- AS I GEAR UP FOR MY CLOTHES IF YOU'D LIKE TO- CUNNINGHAM. YEAH I BET THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN I MAY RAISE SOME ISSUES YOU MIGHT WANT TO DRESS AS WELL- YEAH I STRUGGLED WITH THIS BEFORE DECIDING TO COME ON BOARD AS A CO AUTHOR. FOR A LOT OF THE SAME REASONS AS THE PEOPLE ON THE PHONE AND CHAMBERS TODAY HAVE ARTICULATED- I THINK TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S VITAL. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH OF IT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I HAVE CONCERNS SURROUNDING THAT- BUT ULTIMATELY- YOU KNOW OUR- OUR STATE GOVERNMENT SET UP UNDER THE SEPARATION OF POWERS STRUCTURE- THAN IN MANY WAYS MIRRORS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE HAVE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WITH THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH- UNDER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT THE GOVERNOR OF OUR STATE HAS- THE UNILATERAL POWER. DECLARE AN EMERGENCY- WHICH SHE APPROPRIATELY DEAD DUE TO COVER NINETEEN. IN THE MIDDLE OF MARCH- BUT FROM MARCH SEVENTEENTH TWO TO. TEN MAY THIRD. OF THIS YEAR- AS LEGISLATORS AS REPRESENTATIVE OF NEARLY HALF MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WERE LARGELY SHUT OUT OF THE PROCESS OF GOVERNING THIS IS. CRITICISM OF ANY PARTICULAR BORDERS BUT I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE BEEN FORTY PLUS. THE CHANGE- WORKERS COMP LIABILITY LAWS THE CHANGE VOTING RULES THEY CHANGE ALL SORTS OF THINGS- WITHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE DELIVER PROCESS IN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSPARENCY IN INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC THAT'S A PROBLEM. THAT'S A PROBLEM. A IT'S A BIG PROBLEM THIS. WEEK WE NEED TO FIND THE BALANCE SO WE HAVE THE PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVES WHO SPEAK FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND ARE ARE RECEPTIVE TO THEM AND HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY AND TELL US. AND THEN CARRIED OUT FORWARD INTO INTO THE GOVERNING BODY- AND ENACT THAT THROUGH A- CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. AND WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT DURING EMERGENCIES I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF. NEW EMERGENCIES WILL COME UP IN THE FUTURE AS PEOPLE POINTED OUT NOBODY EXPECTED THIS PANDEMIC TO COME UP- BUT I. I DID NOT ENJOY HAVING CONSTITUENTS JUST LIKE ALL THIS EXPRESSING THEIR GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF STATE GOVERNMENT. ON AND HAVING SOME VERY UNPRECEDENTED DRACONIAN THINGS BEING IMPOSED UPON THEM. AND A AND ASKED TO MAKE TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH- YOU HAVE WHICH WAS APPROPRIATE AT AT THE TIME FOR A TIME BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT THAT MY ONLY ABILITY TO INFLUENCE. STATE GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA WAS. CALLING AND EMAILING THE GOVERNOR YEAH. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS BILL WOULD RESTORE SOME OF THE DEMOCRATIC POWER TO CREATE- A LITTLE BIT BETTER BALLOTS I A SO THAT'S WHY I ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO COME ON BOARD- TO SUPPORT IT HI. WITH WITH DUE REGARD TO THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUES AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE WORKED ON ALSO IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED FOR EVERYBODY THAT CALLED IN OPPOSITION PEOPLE THAT SPOKE WE ARE VOTING TO PUT THIS ON THE BALLOT FOR THE VOTERS TO VOTE FOR. THERE'S NOTHING MORE DEMOCRATIC THAN THAT THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA WILL DECIDE IN NOVEMBER WHETHER THEY WANT THIS CHANGE OR NOT. WE'RE GIVING THEM THE OPTION. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT STATE FOR THE RECORD VERY CLEARLY- I DID HAVE ONE TECHNICAL QUESTION ON THE PROXY VOTING ASPECT- I SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REMOTE VOTING. AND PROXY VOTING PROXY VOTING DOES TO ME RAISE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL. CONCERNS THAT ARE NOT RAISED. IT WITH THE SAME LEVEL WITH RESPECTIVE REMOTE VOTING IN A I WAS HOPEFUL YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN AND YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU. MR GRAYSON. YES THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND JUST TO CLARIFY THE VOTE THAT WE TAE TODAY IS TO- VOTE- ON THE ACA TWENTY FIVE AS AMENDED TO MOVE IT TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE THAT IS CORRECT AND AS AMENDED OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR. THIS WORKS WELL WHEN WE HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. AND THE LIKE THE FORTY. OKAY YOU JUST LOOK AT THE POINT THAT. YEAH I DID THAT THAT OKAY WAS FROM A VEIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MISTER MALONE FOR- FOR INTRODUCING THIS WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH MEMBERS AND ALSO STAKEHOLDERS. ON ON DEVELOPING THIS THIS THIS COULD BE THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL BILL THAT WE PASS- THE SESSION OR EVEN IN IN OUR TIME THE LEGISLATURE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT IS TOO IMPORTANT- TO PASS- UP AT THIS TIME. AND IT AND IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED A PARTICULARLY FROM- I GA- WHICH- I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK THAT THEY PROVIDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACA AND THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE BUT AS OUT. OF LAWMAKERS HAS WE HAVE ADJUSTED TO RUNNING IN THE ASSEMBLY IN IN THE PANDEMIC OR EVEN AS A PARENT WITH TWO CHILDREN. DISTANCE LEARNING WE HAVE ALL NEEDED TO ADAPT AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THROUGH THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND DO IT AS ELEGANTLY AS POSSIBLE WITH THE LEVEL OF. QUALITY AND CERTAINLY IN IN GOVERNMENT. LEVEL TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT IS NECESSARY AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED- HERE IN THE CAPITAL ENGAGEMENT. WHICH HAS BEEN NOTED FOR EXAMPLE THE ABILITY TO PETE FOR PEOPLE THAT WHETHER THEY CAN TAKE THE DAY OFF FROM WORK OR CARING FOR A LOVED ONE- AND CAN SPEND MONEY TO TRAVEL TO SACRAMENTO AND TAKE THAT AND TO GET TO SACK. SO THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU. EIGHT IN THIS PROCEEDING AND- AND THAT'S A PRETTY AMAZING THING IT'S A IT'S A GREAT THING- BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF ACTUALLY GETTING TO SACRAMENTO THAT'S TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO EXPERIENCE OR DECIDE THAT THEIR PRESENCE ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO- OF COURSE THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO WRITE LETTERS AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND DO THAT BY. ALSO NOTED IS THE CONCERN ABOUT WHEN THIS WHATEVER OCCUR BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO AND THE WAY THAT WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY CONDUCTED OUR WORK. WITH THIS ACTUALLY REALLY IS A- WORST CASE SCENARIO BUT ONLY UNDER CERTAIN COMMIT CONDITIONS AND- WITH RULES THAT HAVE BEEN AGREED TO- BY THE TWO HOUSES SO. THERE IS A LOT OF. IF THE EAST ASKED BY VOTERS RULES MUST BE AGREED TO BY THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. FOR HOW TO- CONVENE IN THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY AND SO THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE TO YOUR HOW WE ENSURE. ACCESS AND TRANSPARENCY- IN THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY MEETING AND SO AGAIN I WANT TO THINK THAT THE MEMBER THE OP. EVERYONE HAS BEEN THAT CRITICAL FEEDBACK WE NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT. WE NEED TO HAVE GOVERNMENT WORK AND TOO OFTEN- I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO END THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE COME IN OF GOVERNMENT ARE ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WERE DISCORD. SO DISTRAUGHT AND TO UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY FOR GOVERNMENTS TO DO THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING. SO WHAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND TO THE AUTHOR AGAIN I KNOW NOW- MY STUDIES YEAH WE ARE. CALLER. PROBABLY REALLY YOU WERE YEAH I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. SOME OF THE KEY WORDS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY TO CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES OR WORDS LIKE PUBLIC PER PATIENT TRANSPARENCY MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE INTEGRITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT DâN AS WE LOOK AT THE CIVIL ON REST. SOME OF THE ANGER WE'RE HEARING IT BECAUSE HE- CAN AND OF CELL BLOCK FROM GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARY ONLY IN SACRAMENTO IT CAN BE AT THEIR LOCAL FOR MEN. TIMES A PUBLIC. THE AMOUNT OF KHAT I KNOW WHEN I FOR AIR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN SPEAK FOR THREE MINUTES ON A TOPIC IN SOME SOME EVEN LONG. ON NOT POSTED ITEM IT WAS A SHOCK TO COME UP HERE AND FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS TWO WITNESSES WHO COULD SPEAK AND THEN YOU COULD EITHER STATE OP CENTER SUPPORT. THOUGH I KNOW. YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC DOESN'T ALWAYS IS IN THEIR ARE FOR TO THESE THEY LOOK THE IDEA THAT IF THEY CHOOSE. A SO I THINK THAT I WILL STILL. IN THIS FORWARD BUT- THE CONCERN THAT I HEARD ABOUT WILL WE MAKE UP A REASON TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY OR WHAT WOULD BE THE CRITERIA FOR A FUTURE EMERGENCY I THINK THAT THERE SO THAT BELIEVE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN CALL THE CALL THE NINETEEN MARGINS ENDEMIC. IN THAT'S UP FOR. AND BUT- I STARTED ON ANOTHER ISSUE TODAY RULES WAS THAT WE ARE ALL ON ELECTED BY DISTRICT ALMOST A HALF A MILLION VOTERS VOTE AND WE REPRESENT THEM AND I TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. AND WITH THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE VOTERS KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING NO WHERE WERE AT. IT WE SHOULD BE HERE AND WE CAN BE. SO THAT MEANS I WANT TO CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING THIS THAT THIS WILL NOW GO TO THE FLOOR OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY. AND IT PASSED IT WILL GO TO BALLOT. THERE IS MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO WEIGH. FOR IT READ. AND TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE SEVERAL OF THE JURORS MENTION WE'D BE UP IN A SENSE CREATE RULES HAVE SELECT BY. AND THEN. NOT WHAT YOU PROPOSED HERE BUT I DO IN THE PUBLIC LAST BUT NOT LEAST I THINK WE HAVE SEEN SOME. ADDITIONAL UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE CALL WHEN CALLS THAT WE'VE HAD ALSO WITH ZOOM MEETINGS AND SO FORTH I KNOW NOW EVEN THOUGH I'M HERE. CAN PARTICIPATE IN ZOOM CALL THE MY EX OF EVENTS GOING ON. IN THE DISTRICT WHERE I REALLY NEVER. TO NEEDED BEFORE. SO I THOUGHT WE'DTAKE THE BEST FROM THIS CRISIS BUT WHAT THE FOCUS ALWAYS ON WE SERVE THE PUBLIC THANK YOU. I HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. CENTER BY MS CARILLO. I WANT TO SPEAK TO THIS AND- THIS ISN'T A FINISHER I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS HAS BEEN EXPRESSED. THIS IS A PROPOSED CONSCIOUS AMENDMENTS WHAT ACTUALLY HAS TO GO BEFORE. THE WE THE PEOPLE TO WEIGH AND EVALUATE IT. I THINK IT IS A DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC IN OUR SISTER GOVERNMENT TO HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE ARISE. THAT SIGNED LINES AND RENDERS AN EFFECTIVE THE LEGISLATURE. AT A TIME OF CRISIS. THE OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WORK WELL WHEN ONE ANYONE BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT. HAS THE UPPER HAND IN THE OTHER BRANCHES ARE IMPOTENT. SO. I ACTUALLY FEEL THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. HOW DO WE MAKE MAJOR EFFECT IN TIMES OF CRISIS SO OUR JOB OF BEING A- CHECK AND BALANCE WITHOUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM GOVERNOR CAN BE UPHELD. THAT'S WHAT THIS PRESENTS AS A QUESTION. I WANT TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION ABOUT THE TIMELINESS ACTUALLY OF A QUESTION LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW THINGS APPEAR ON THE BALLOT ALL THE TIMES THE LEGISLATURE MAY PUT THINGS ON THE BALLOT THEY MAY ARRIVE HERE BY. THE NATIONAL. IT IS NOT TYPICALLY THE CASE THAT MATTERS ARRIVE ON THE STATEWIDE BALLOT AT A MOMENT. WHEN THE PUBLIC IS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE ISSUE. IN THIS SENSE WE HAVE THREE PHAM LI LARGE FACTORS. THAT CALIFORNIANS EVERYONE OF THEM ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY AS IT AFFECTS ALL OF OUR BUSINESS IS DONE THIS IS A REALITY IN EVERYONE'S LIVES AND THE THREAT BOUND UP IN A CA TWENTY FIVE BUT FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES AND EMERGE WE WOULD NOT BE IN THIS QUOTE. WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY. THE YOU COULD REMOTELY WITH ACCOUNTABILITY I THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO THE AMENDMENT THIS MORNING. SECONDARILY WE HAVE THIS THIS PANDEMIC WHICH AGAIN PEOPLE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THEIR CUENTA WITH TO UNDERSTAND HOW DESTRUCTIVE IT IS BEEN. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES IF YOU BELIEVE IN ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT IF YOU BELIEVE IN A LEGISLATURE THAT STANDS UP FOR WE THE PEOPLE. IF THEY ARE PREVENTED FROM DOING THEIR JOB BY SOME HEALTH CRISIS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT. AND FRANKLY I FEEL THIS MOMENT. OF. BEING A GAS TO WHAT HAPPENED TO MISTER FLOYD. AND THE PUBLIC REACTION AND PARTICIPATION HAS ENSUED FROM THAT. WHICH IS THE PUBLIC EXPRESSING ITS INHERENT RIGHT IN OUR DEMOCRACY TO BRING ITS VOICE TO BEAR. I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT TO IT IT'LL BE A PART OF THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS THIS FALL. TECHNOLOGY OVERHEAD AND THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO BE HURT. I THINK THESE THREE ELEMENTS FRAME HOW PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS DECIDE HOW THEY FEEL- YEARS AGO TWENTY TEN PROP NINETEEN WAS ON THE BALLOT THAT WAS A MEDICAL. MARIJUANA AND ISSUE. AND MIGHT. I WENT ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES A POODLE MATTER ON THE BALLOT DO A TAXATION MARIJUANA. AND I THOUGHT WHAT BETTER TIME TO ASK MY VOTERS TO THINK ABOUT MARIJUANA TAXATION WHEN THERE'S A HUGE DEBATE HAVE BEEN ON MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION. AND I FOUND IN RANCHO CORDOVA PEOPLE HAD NO TROUBLE DECIDING HOW THEY FELT ABOUT NINETEEN BUT ALSO OUR LOCAL MEASURE. AND I FEEL VERY MUCH THE SAME WAY THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHEN BECAUSE OF THE EMERGENCE OF TECHNOLOGY THE COVE IT. AND THE CURRENT- TIME OF PROTEST PEOPLE WILL FIGURE OUT QUICKLY HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THIS AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THE PRO AND CON OF SUPPORTING THE STATION EXERCISE OF ITS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY. SO ANY FURTHER COMMENTS BY ANY MEMBER MISTER MOORE WE GO DO YOU TO RESPOND AND CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBER AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THAT WHICH IS ON DISPLAY IN PARTICULAR IS CUNNINGHAM SPEAKING TO- THE IMPORTANCE OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT- IN THESE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES THE IMPORTANCE OF CHECKS. AND BALANCES IN TERMS OF MISTER CUNNINGHAM QUESTION ON- REMOTE VOTING PROVISIONS. ACTUALLY VOTING- OF VERSUS TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS MANY OF THOSE DIFFICULT ISSUES WOULD BE WORKED OUT IN A RESOLUTION. THAT THE VOTERS ARE SPECIALLY AUTHORIZING US TO PUT FORWARD TWO THIRDS VOTE IN BOTH HOUSES THE VOTERS WOULD BE AUTHORIZING US. TO EXPLORE A REMOTE VOTING CAPABILITY PERSONALLY I. BELIEVE REMOTE VOTING USING TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS WITH FULL PUBLIC INPUT AND PARTICIPATION UTILIZING THE ONLINE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE MAY BE PREFERABLE TO PROXY VOTING THAT'S JUST A PERSONAL PREFERENCE BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING THOSE DISCUSSION ROBUST DISCUSSIONS IN- BOTH HOUSES WHAT. COMES TIME TO ADOPT THE RESOLUTION WHERE SOME OF THESE REALLY TRICKY ISSUES CAN BE WORKED THROUGH I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR CALLING. IT IS SUB OPTIMAL THE PHONE OPERATION YOU HAVE TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES THERE THIS IS IN PERFECT BUT THE PUBLIC IS HAVING THEIR VOICE HEARD TODAY ON THIS VERY ISSUE AND ULTIMATELY THEY'RE GOING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO AUTHORIZE. US TO MOVE FORWARD AND I DO HOPE SOME OF THE- AND OPPONENTS HAVE THE- MOST RECENT VERSION WITH. A VERSION OF THIS ACA WHICH STRENGTHENS- THE PUBLIC INPUT AND TRANSPARENCY. TIONS IN ALIGNMENT WITH PROP FIFTY FOUR SO- MANY OF THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE OUTSTANDING- WILL BE DEALT WITH IN THE RESOLUTION WHEN THAT COMES TO BEAR BUT- JUST IN TERMS OF PUBLIC INPUT WHAT I'M ENVISIONING IS THAT WE USE- ONLINE TOOLS HEARINGS FLOOR SESSION. ALL OF THOSE DELIBERATIONS ONLINE VISIBLE TO THE PUBLIC NOT IN THE DARK ONLINE FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE AND RECORDED AND CAPTURED AN ARCHIVE- PURSUANT TO A PROP FIFTY FOUR- AND IT MAY UNDER THESE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THIS WOULD APPLY AND KEEP IN MIND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC NOW BUT WE'RE HAVING A HEARING IN THIS BUILDING. WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE THESE ARE THE MOST EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE A SAFETY CONCERN ABOUT PHYSICALLY BEING IN THIS BUILDING HAVING THIS IS A FAIL SAFE A SO WE CAN KEEP THE BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE LIVING FOR. AND HAVE SENT BACK THIS IS. OUR PROCESS. SO IN TERMS OF- BLAKESLEE OR HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR HERE IS A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT GO BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS A CA VALID ISSUES TO BE SURE- BUT IN TERMS OF THIS EASY HEY WE ARE ALL ON A EXTREMELY CONDENSED TIMELINE TO GET THIS THROUGH BOTH OF OUR HOUSES AND GET IT TO THE VOTERS. OF CALIFORNIA- BUT I WELCOME HIS INPUT AND HIS EXPERTISE AND HIS WORK AROUND- DEMOCRACY IN TRANSPARENCY ISSUES WHEN WE WORK ON- THAT RESOLUTION SHOULD THE VOTERS AUTHORIZED INTAKE CONCERNS TROUNCED IN SETTING PROVISIONS AND SO FORTH THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH BUT WE GET TO THE REST. PROP BEST THE- OF THE A FISH UP. OF THE LOBBY COMMUNITY TO THIS I'M CANDIDLY A BIT PUZZLED BY THAT. IN THAT YOU KNOW I HAVE I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE WORK OF THE LOT THIS IN THIS BUILDING WE RELY ON THEIR EXPERTISE. ON A REGULAR BASIS AND- WILL CONTINUE TO ROCK RELY ON THEIR EXPERTISE AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT UNDER HESE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES IF WE'RE PHYSICALLY NOT IN THIS BUILDING THE LOBBYING COMMUNITY KNOWS HOW TO GET A HOLD OF US AND HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD. THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. WHEN WE'RE NOT IN THIS BUILDING IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC THIS ENTIRE EFFORT IS BEING DONE WITH PUBLIC INPUT. OUT FRANKLY WELL WE'VE BEEN HOME DURING RECESS I'VE NEVER HEARDMORE FROM THE PUBLIC. BECAUSE OF ALL THE ISSUES WITH ADD AND THE ECONOMIC- THE DEVASTATION THAT'S BEING FELT ACROSS THE STATE- SO THOSE ARE THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS- WE ARE HEARING FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WILL CONTINUE. TO BE PARAMOUNT. SO LIMIT LET ME JUST SAY- IN CLOSING OUT AYE IT'S BEEN A LONG HEARING LONGER THAN I THOUGHT. LET ME JUST SAY IN CLOSING MISTER CHAIR THAT CALIFORNIA. IS THE HOME OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION WE SHOULD BE LEADING ON THE ISSUE OF UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PUBLIC ACCESS AND TRANSPARENCY. AND BUILD A MODERN DIGITAL DEMOCRACY WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE MOST NARROW OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE SHOULD BE DOING THE DIGITAL DEMOCRACY ANYWAY BUT THE APPLICATION OF IT IN A REMOTE VOTING SETTING IT'S GOING TO BE UNDER THE MOST EXTREME. OF RARE CIRCUMSTANCES I WANT TO THE SIZE THAT I AM TOTALLY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT ANY CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES. WHEN SOLUTION ON. ANY TOTAL HARMONY WITH. FOR AN OPERATE TOTALLY IN THE SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT OF FIFTY FOUR WHICH IS TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN GOVERNMENT. PROP FIFTY FOUR WITH OVER 65% OF THE VOTE THAT'S ALMOST A SUPERMAJORITY OF OUR VOTERS THEY WANT OPEN GOVERNMENT THEY WANT TRANSPARENCY WE NEED TO BE OPERATING IN THAT SPIRIT- IF WE MAKE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES- PURSUANT TO A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE WITH TRANSPARENCY. PUBLIC ACCESS AT THE FOREFRONT. A HOUSE RIGHT NOW IS UTILIZING PROXY VOTING. AND THAT'S AN EXPERIMENT I'M SURE WILL BE ANALYZED BUT LET ME EMPHASIZE WE ARE SUBMITTING THIS TO THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA AWAY AND TOTALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH MR BLAKESLEE. MR MONGER OTHER GOOD GOVERNMENT GROUPS THAT WERE SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSITION FEAR BEFORE TO MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA GETS THIS CONSTITUTIONAL MODERNIZATION. AND MAKES GOVERNMENT MORE TRANSPARENT NOT LAST WENT ON AN UNEXPECTED EMERGENCIES STRIKE CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY MISTER CHAIR LET ME JUST SAY CALIFORNIA OF ALL PLACES. THE END OF EARTHQUAKES FLOODS FIRES AND NOW PANDEMICS.
