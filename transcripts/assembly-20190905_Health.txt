SEE NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR BIGELOW. QUESTIONS PROBABLY MARTIN FOR THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND IT AND IT'S ONE OF THE AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LOGO AS IT'S BEING. DOWNSIZED SLIGHTLY WHICH- DOESN'T MAKE MUCH OF AN ISSUE I THINK THE RECOGNITION OF WHAT IT IS IN THE ABILITY FOR THE INDUSTRY TO MARKET THAT AND HANDLE IT MORE EFFECTIVE WAY IS GREAT. BUT THERE IS A LITTLE SPACE UNDERNEATH THERE THAT'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR UTILIZATION. IS THERE GOING TO BE A WAY TO MAYBE HELP CLARIFY SO PEOPLE WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS. THC OR WHETHER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SEE SO THAT CAN BE MARKED ON THEIR IN A CLEAR WAY SO THE USER WILL NOT CONFUSE BY. BY NOT KNOWING. SOMEONE I REALLY APPRECIATE QUESTION IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE INTRODUCED THE BILL YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE. BELOW HOWEVER WHAT WHAT THE COMPANIES ARE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THAT RATIO. IS CLEARLY VISIBLE IS THERE EITHER HAVING TO NOT INCLUDED THERE THEY'RE JUST THEIR BRANDS ON THE V. PART. FOR PROVIDE THE RATIO BECAUSE IF YOU TRY TO PUT IT BELOW IT'S VERY VERY SMALL AND IT WILL BE HARD TO SEE BUT TYPICALLY FOR PATIENTS. A LOT OF WHOM USE ONE STRAIN OR A RATIO DURING THE DAY AND A DIFFERENT STRAIN BY NIGHT SO. SO ALLOWING THE VAPOR. OR THE SYMBOL TO NOT HAVE TO WRAP AROUND THE PRODUCT LEAVES ROOM FOR THE RATIO DESIGNATION AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL PRODUCT. LOGO ITSELF. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE CONCERN I'VE GOT. THE CONFUSION THAT MAY MAY COME ABOUT SO IF THE INDUSTRY IS LOOKING AT A SOLUTIONS SO THAT WE- CAN CLEARLY HAVE THE- CUSTOMER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE OF WHAT THEY'RE USUALLY. USING WILL WITH SOME CLARITY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.
