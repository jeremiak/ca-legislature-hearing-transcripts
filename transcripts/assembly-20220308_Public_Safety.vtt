COUNTRY'S LIVING THROUGH A GUN

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.305
VIOLENCE CRISIS OF EPIDEMIC

PROPORTIONS WITH TENS OF

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.309
THOUSANDS KILLED EVERY YEAR AND

MANY MORE WOUNDED. OVER THE

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:54.512
COURSE OF OUR LIFETIMES I

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:57.449
BELIEVE EVERY AMERICAN WILL KNOW

00:26:57.515 --> 00:26:59.651
SOMEONE WHO LOSES THEIR LIFE TO

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:01.720
GUN VIOLENCE. THIS IS UNIQUELY

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.521
AMERICAN PHENOMENON AND THE

00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:04.889
QUESTION IS WHY IS THIS

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.758
HAPPENING SO MUCH MORE IN

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:07.759

OTHER FIRST WORLD COUNTRY HAVE

00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:14.566
SO MUCH LESS GUN VIOLENCE IT'S

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:17.302
PREPOSTEROUS TO THINK THAT ALL

00:27:18.703 --> 00:27:21.339
SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER MENTALLY ILL

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:23.541
PEOPLE. I THINK THE REASON IS

00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:24.642
OBVIOUS WE HAVE THE WEAKEST GUN

00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:26.845

PLEADING WITH THEM TO BE QUIET.

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:58.629

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.403
SIGNIFICANT AND ALARMING RISE IN

TO REPORTS FROM OTHER RETAILERS

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:27.843
IN THE AREA. IN THE LAST YEAR

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.545
TRAIN COMPANY OFFICIALS AT UNION

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.721
CHANGES TO HOW LOW LEVEL

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.723
OFFENSES ARE PROSECUTED. TAKING

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:44.593
IN THE SCENE GAVIN NEWSOM SAID

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.628
THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A THIRD

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.563
WORLD COUNTRY. ALL THE ALL PART

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:48.898
OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT.

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:50.266
RETAILERS ARE OFTEN I AT THIS

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:51.434
POINT I JUST AVOID

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.269
CONFRONTATIONS WITH SHOPLIFTERS

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.537
OR DON'T EVEN FILE POLICE

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:56.972
REPORTS- BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT-

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.574
NOTHING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IF

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.576
THEY DO. SO THIS CREATED THIS IS

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:02.344
CREATED A TOTAL BREAKDOWN IN THE

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.913
RULE OF LAW SYSTEM WAR CRIMINALS

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:05.681
FEEL WHOLLY FREE TO ACT OUTSIDE

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.683
OF THE LAW WITHOUT FEAR. OF

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.618
LEGAL CONSEQUENCES WE'VE ALL

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:12.421
SEEN VIDEOS OF WHAT HAPPENS-

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:14.023
THERE WAS ONE THAT WENT VIRAL

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:15.591
RECENTLY WHERE IN THE SAN

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:16.826
FRANCISCO WALGREENS A MAN

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:18.861
CASUALLY LOADS HIS BICYCLE I

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.396

HAPA BOTHERED AS HE AS HE RIDES

OUT AS HE WALKS OUT THE DOOR. IT

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:28.604
IS SIMPLY NOT FAIR TO LAW

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.773
ABIDING CALIFORNIANS WHO DESERVE

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.409

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:43.886
AND REHABILITATION NEEDED. TO

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:46.121
TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND. IF WE

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:47.756
ARE GOING TO DO CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:50.960
REFORM. IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:52.795
SMART STRATEGIC. EVIDENCE BASED

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:55.698
WAY. PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS THE

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.600

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.203
HATCHET TO OUR PENAL CODE AND

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.105
IMPERILLED OUR CITIZENRY.

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:04.907
CALIFORNIANS ARE UNWILLING TO

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.242
TOLERATE THIS ANY LONGER.

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:07.977
ACCORDING TO A POLL BY UC

01:09:08.043 --> 01:09:08.978

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.885
INCREASING IN CALIFORNIA. AND BY

A TWO TO ONE MARGIN. CALIFORNIA

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.557

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.729
SOME FOLKS ARE WONDERING IF

THERE IS CAUSATION BETWEEN THESE

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:31.000
PROPOSITIONS REFERRING TO 47-57

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:32.768
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY AND

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.103
ATTORNEY GENERAL DECIDED THAT

01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:35.771
YES THERE MAY BE. HE SAID HE

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:37.540
BACKS CHANGES TO ADDRESS

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:38.474

IN LOCKSTEP ON ISSUES OF PUBLIC

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:48.651
SAFETY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ARE

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:50.052
PRETTY MUCH DIAMETRICALLY

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:52.021
OPPOSED DIFFERENT VOTING RECORDS

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.589

MISDEMEANORS THEY CAN BE

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:19.847
PROSECUTED. THE DECISION NOT TO

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:23.083
DISCRETIONARY DECISION NOT TO

BROUGHT TO TRIAL THEY CAN'T BE

01:40:28.956 --> 01:40:30.791
CONVICTED THEY CAN BE SENTENCED

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:32.793
TO A COUNTY JAIL THEY CAN BE

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:34.161
ORDERED INTO TREATMENT IS A

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:36.130
DECISION NOT TO DO THAT.

01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:38.966
SECONDARILY IT'S LOG ON THE

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:43.537
PREMISE THAT IN THIS NOT TO BE.

01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:45.706
BUT CHIEF WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:47.541
ARREST PEOPLE IN PUT THEM IN BY

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:49.977
THIS IS AS FAR. WELL WE ALL BE

01:40:50.043 --> 01:40:50.611
JUST FINE. THAT COLLIDES WITH

01:40:50.677 --> 01:40:52.379
HISTORIC FACTS AND THAT FACT IS

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:55.048
THAT IN THIS IS A BIT PAINFUL.

01:40:55.115 --> 01:40:56.049
TO TO ADMIT AS A CAREER LAW

01:40:56.116 --> 01:40:57.684
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AFTER THE

01:40:57.751 --> 01:40:59.319
FACT VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE

01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:01.321
CAPTURED AND IDENTIFIED AND

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:03.791
BROUGHT TO TRIAL VERY FEW. THE

01:41:03.857 --> 01:41:06.026
JUNGLE CURRENT DOJ STATS FOR

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:06.894
CASE CLEARANCE OF THE CRIMES

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.430
LISTED IN IMPROV FORTY SEVEN

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:11.331
THIS YEAR OR LAST YEAR'S USE ME

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:12.933
EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT. THAT

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.868
DOES REPORTED CRIMES HALF OF

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:16.136
THESE CRIMES ARE NEVER REPORTED

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:17.704
WHICH IS A PROBLEM WE OUGHT TO

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:19.473
BE TALKING ABOUT. SAN FRANCISCO

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.408
PD IS AN EXAMPLE WHICH IS ONE OF

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:25.212
THOSE PLACES WE'VE ALL ABOUT FOR THE FORTY FIVE

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:25.746
YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THIS

01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:27.114
BUSINESS. TWO PEOPLE ARE THREE

01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:28.315
POINT SIX SEVEN CLEARANCE RATE.

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:30.017
SO IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:32.119
TO CONVINCE PEOPLE IS THAT AN

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:33.554
OUTCOME THERE'S A CHEAT LESS

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.656
THAN 5% OF THE TIME LESS THAN

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:37.591
THAT IS SOMEHOW THE CORNERSTONE

01:41:37.658 --> 01:41:40.661
PIECE OF. LEGISLATION TO ENSURE

01:41:40.727 --> 01:41:44.865
THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE PUBLIC

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:46.934
SAFETY AND THEN TO MAINTAIN IT.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:47.601
AND THEN ALSO SAYS THAT IF WE

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:49.636
CAN'T DO THAT THEN THERE'S NO

01:41:49.703 --> 01:41:51.004
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S ALSO NOT

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:52.339
TRUE. THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY IN

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:54.875
THE SYSTEM IF IT'S GOING TO BE

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:57.544
EXERCISED. ROAD TO THE FOUR

01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:59.746
HUNDRED DOLLAR THRESHOLD. WELL

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:01.448
I'M THINKING WE ALL UNDERSTAND

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:02.816
THAT EVERY STATE IN THE UNION

01:42:02.883 --> 01:42:04.017
HAS A THRESHOLD THAT TRIGGERS

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:05.986
THE MOVEMENT BETWEEN MISDEMEANOR

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:08.555
FELONY. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:12.192
A THRESHOLD THAT EXCEEDS THE

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:13.293
THRESHOLD IN THIRTY NINE OTHER

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.029
STATES. IT BROILED RELATIVE TO

01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:18.432
THE FUNDING WHY WOULD WE NOT

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:20.400
WANT. IN THIS COMING YEAR A

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:21.468
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:22.503
DOLLARS TO GO BACK INTO

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:24.404
COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:42:24.471 --> 01:42:26.440
AND RESOURCES INCLUDING VICTIM

01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:28.675
HELP. THAT'S GENERATED UNIQUELY

01:42:28.742 --> 01:42:30.978
BY PROP FORTY SEVEN AND UNIQUELY

01:42:31.044 --> 01:42:32.446
TARGETED TOWARDS THOSE- THOSE

01:42:32.513 --> 01:42:35.782
SORT. OF THOSE RESOURCES AND HAS

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:37.451
BEEN VERIFIED BY THE- BORDER

STATE COMMIT A COMMUNITY

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.954
CORRECTIONS THAT WORK IT REDUCES

01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:42.589
RECIDIVISM WHY WE TURN AROUND

01:42:42.656 --> 01:42:43.590
SAY WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT

01:42:43.657 --> 01:42:46.894
ANYMORE WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.728
DIGNIFY THAT MONEY. WHAT'S THE

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:49.763

01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:28.221
RISEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:29.956
YEARS IT'S POVERTY IT'S STRUGGLE

01:50:30.023 --> 01:50:32.425
WITH DESPERATION I AGREE WITH MY

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:34.694
COLLEAGUES FROM LANCASTER THAT

01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:35.929
DUCT TAPE MEASURES TO TRY TO

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:37.931
REPAIR THESE HARMS ARE GOING TO

01:50:37.998 --> 01:50:40.133
DO ENOUGH WE NEED A FULL SCALE.

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.835
ATTACK IN THAT ATTACK HAS TO BE

01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:43.737
ROOTED IN GETTING PEOPLE IN

ECONOMIC MOBILITY GETTING PEOPLE

01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:48.508
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE NOT

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:50.744
GOING TO GET THAT BY SPENDING

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.145
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:54.080
A YEAR TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE FOR

STEALING LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND

01:50:55.715 --> 01:50:57.317
DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS. THAT'S

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:59.552
HOW WE GOT INTO THIS PROBLEM AT

LEAST TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK TIME

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:03.823

PEERS CHINA RUSSIA. IN

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:13.199
CALIFORNIA WE STILL SPEND

01:51:13.266 --> 01:51:14.234
FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:16.169
INCARCERATING EVEN NOW WITH THE

01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:17.904
PASSAGE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN. BUT

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:20.507
PROP FORTY SEVEN HAS. GIVEN A

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:21.608
SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:51:21.674 --> 01:51:23.176
COST SAVINGS COST SAVINGS THEY

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:24.244
HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN THE

01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:25.278
COMMUNITIES. THERE'S OVER A

01:51:25.345 --> 01:51:26.513
DOZEN TRAUMA CENTERS THAT HAVE

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:28.348
COME UP BECAUSE OF PROP FORTY

01:51:28.415 --> 01:51:29.382
SEVEN. THE VICTIM SERVICES THAT

01:51:29.449 --> 01:51:30.884
HAVE INCREASED BECAUSE OF PROP

01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:32.452
FORTY SEVEN. IT WAS SMART

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:34.788
STRATEGIC. EVIDENCE BASED AND

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:36.790
APPROVED BY THE VOTERS NOW'S NOT

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:38.858
THE TIME TO GO BACKWARDS. NOW

01:51:38.925 --> 01:51:40.827
IT'S TIME TO ADDRESS THE ROOT

01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:42.395
CAUSES THE MOVE FORWARD IN THOSE

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:42.929
ROOT CAUSES. WE NEED COST

01:51:42.996 --> 01:51:45.432
SAVINGS TO ADDRESS PROP FORTY

01:51:45.498 --> 01:51:47.300
SEVEN REPEALING IT WOULD ROLL US

01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:48.301
BACKWARDS. I URGE THIS COMMITTEE

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.003
IN MY COLLEAGUES TO STAND WITH

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:52.305

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:56.109
THANK YOU. IS THIS YEAR. THANK

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:59.679

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:01.548
KNOW YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE MAY HAD

01:52:01.614 --> 01:52:03.716
HERE MORE LIKE MR KILEY WHEN YOU

01:52:03.783 --> 01:52:06.786
SAW ME LAST LIKE WAS LIKE WORK.

01:52:06.853 --> 01:52:10.690
THANK YOU- ANYWAY FIVE I THINK.

01:52:10.757 --> 01:52:13.393
THAT I GO BACK TO THE PREMISE OF

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:14.461
PROP FORTY SEVEN WHEN IT WAS

01:52:14.527 --> 01:52:15.895
PRESENTED TO THE VOTERS. SAFE

01:52:15.962 --> 01:52:20.567
COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS. THAT'S

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:22.268
WHAT THEY VOTED ON THAT'S WHAT

01:52:22.335 --> 01:52:24.904
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE VOTING ON

01:52:24.971 --> 01:52:26.206
. AND THIS HAS NOT RESULTED. IN

01:52:26.272 --> 01:52:31.044
THAT IN FACT WHAT HAS RESULTED

01:52:31.111 --> 01:52:34.547
IN THAT IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

01:52:34.614 --> 01:52:34.981
THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:38.118
INCARCERATED THEY GET OUT AND

01:52:38.184 --> 01:52:39.853
THEN THEY CONTINUE TO GO DOWN

01:52:39.919 --> 01:52:44.657
THE PATH. OF COMMITTING CRIMES

01:52:44.724 --> 01:52:46.559
AND THOSE CRIMES ARE COMMITTED

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:50.096
AGAINST WHO. ALLOW LIVE BY LAW

01:52:50.163 --> 01:52:52.799
ABIDING CITIZENS. WE'RE NOT

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:57.704
GOING TO. FIX THIS PROBLEM BY

01:52:57.770 --> 01:53:01.241
ALLOWING LOW LEVEL DRUG OFFENSES

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:02.075
WHAT WE CALL LOW LEVEL DRUG

01:53:02.142 --> 01:53:04.110
OFFENSES TO BE TO MANIFEST

01:53:04.177 --> 01:53:07.714
THEMSELVES INTO PEOPLE. WHO CAN

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:08.948
NO LONGER CARE FOR THEMSELVES

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:11.918
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A CONSTANT

01:53:11.985 --> 01:53:14.420
DRUG INDUCED PSYCHOSIS. SO NOW

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:17.090
WE HAVE FAR MORE HOMELESS PEOPLE

01:53:17.157 --> 01:53:18.625
THAN WE EVER HAD IN A LARGE

01:53:18.691 --> 01:53:21.928
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE. ARE PEOPLE

01:53:21.995 --> 01:53:23.463
THAT ARE IN THIS DRUG INDUCED

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:26.299
PSYCHOSIS BECAUSE GUESS WHAT

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:29.402
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SIGN UP FOR

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:31.037
THOSE BADLY NEEDED

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:33.306
REHABILITATION FACILITIES AND

01:53:33.373 --> 01:53:34.841
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET BETTER

01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:37.243
IN THIRTY DAYS I'VE SEEN THAT

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:39.979
CYCLE. AS A PARAMEDIC IN

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:42.615
INGLEWOOD. I GOT TO GO ON PEOPLE

01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:44.751
THEY WOULD GET ARRESTED FOR

01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:46.553
BEING ON HEROIN OR DOING THOSE

01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:48.254
TYPE OF DRUGS THEY WOULD GO

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:50.523
THROUGH THE PROGRAM. I GUESS

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:53.226
WHAT THEY'RE RIGHT BACK ON THE

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:54.861
STREETS THIRTY DAYS LATERAND

01:53:54.928 --> 01:53:57.397
I'M GIVING HIM NOR CAN SO THEY

01:53:57.463 --> 01:53:59.632
CAN LIVE AGAIN. FOR NOT HELPING

01:53:59.699 --> 01:54:02.368
THOSE FOLKS OUT BY NOT BY BY

01:54:02.435 --> 01:54:05.038
ABIDING BY THIS PROP FORTY SEVEN

01:54:05.104 --> 01:54:06.673
IT DID NOT HELP THOSE PEOPLE AT

01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:08.374
ALL IT'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE

01:54:08.441 --> 01:54:10.543
TO HELP PEOPLE. SO WHAT WE

01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:13.179
REALLY NEED IS FOR THE VOTERS

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:14.547
WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING

01:54:14.614 --> 01:54:17.250
SAFE COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS TO

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:18.952
BE ABLE TO RECONSIDER WHETHER

01:54:19.018 --> 01:54:21.120
THAT IS THE END RESULT OF A

01:54:21.187 --> 01:54:24.057
POLICY THAT THEY SAID- WE BUY IT

01:54:24.123 --> 01:54:26.693
WE YEAH WE WANT SAFE COMMUNITIES

01:54:26.759 --> 01:54:27.694
SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.462
IT. AND NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:54:29.529 --> 01:54:31.464
REALLY UPSET. AND WHETHER YOU

01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:33.199
THINK THEY'RE AT THEIR I'M

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:36.069
JUSTIFIED OR NOT. I THINK GIVING

01:54:36.135 --> 01:54:37.737
THEM THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO

01:54:37.804 --> 01:54:39.706
TAKE A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT THE

01:54:39.772 --> 01:54:41.608
PARTS OF PROPER FOR PROP FORTY

01:54:41.674 --> 01:54:43.176
SEVEN THAT THEY MAY NOT AGREE

01:54:43.243 --> 01:54:45.445
WITH AND IF THERE ARE PARTS IF

01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:46.746
THEY DO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT WE

01:54:46.813 --> 01:54:48.481
CAN HAVE A WE CAN HAVE ABILL

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:49.616
THAT THAT ADDRESSES THOSE. BUT

01:54:49.682 --> 01:54:53.319
YOU CANNOT SIT HERE AND TELL ME

01:54:53.386 --> 01:54:53.920
THAT PROP FORTY SEVEN HAS NO

01:54:53.987 --> 01:54:57.657
EFFECT ON CRIME. OR RECIDIVISM.

01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:59.158
THE ONLY RECIDIVISM IT HAS AN

01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:01.961
EFFECT ON. IS ONCE SOMEBODY GETS

01:55:02.028 --> 01:55:04.097
OUT OF PRISON THEY JUST SAY. ANY

01:55:04.163 --> 01:55:06.299
CRIMES ARE THE CRIMES YOU COMMIT

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:08.701
BELOW THIS LEVEL FROM NOW ON

01:55:08.768 --> 01:55:09.702
WE'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY

01:55:09.769 --> 01:55:11.638
CONSIDER. YOU KNOW GETTING YOU

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:13.373
BACK INTO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE%

01:55:13.439 --> 01:55:15.008
WE CAN FIX YOU WHAT NEEDS FIXED

01:55:15.074 --> 01:55:17.110
IS THE ENVIRONMENT. THE

01:55:17.176 --> 01:55:19.245
INCARCERATION ENVIRONMENT YES

01:55:19.312 --> 01:55:21.114
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CAN BE

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.949
REHAB AND WE NEED TO FIX THAT.

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:24.884
BUT WE DON'T WORK ON THAT AT ALL

01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:27.687
. SO I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:29.055
STEP IN RECOGNIZING WHAT THE

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:31.190
REAL PROBLEM IS AND THAT PROBLEM

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:33.893
IS WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:34.927
REHABILITATE PEOPLE THE RIGHT

01:55:34.994 --> 01:55:38.298
WAY. EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT.

01:55:38.364 --> 01:55:40.066
BECAUSE WE DON'T WE'RE DOING

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:41.401
THEM A DISSERVICE WE'RE DOING

01:55:41.467 --> 01:55:43.002
EVERY LAW ABIDING CITIZEN WHO

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:44.671
BECOMES A VICTIM AND I DON'T

01:55:44.737 --> 01:55:45.905
CARE IF THAT MEANS SOMEBODY

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:48.207
BROKE OUT YOUR WINDOW. THEY ARE

01:55:48.274 --> 01:55:49.876
BECOMING A VICTIM AND THEY'RE

01:55:49.942 --> 01:55:52.011
SICK AND TIRED OF IT. I HEAR HIM

01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:55.014
ALL THE TIME. LIESER IS SICK AND

01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:58.184
TIRED OF IT. SO THAT'S WHY I AM

01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:01.988
GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS. IS

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:04.590
THAT RIGHT RIGHT M. SPORT YES.

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:07.093
BECAUSE I WANT THIS I WANT US TO

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.594
RECOGNIZE WHAT THE REAL PROBLEMS

01:56:08.661 --> 01:56:11.964
ARE IN OUR SYSTEM AND FIX THOSE

01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:13.933
AND STOP IGNORING THOSE PARTS OF

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.369
IT. BECAUSE WE DO THAT I THINK

01:56:16.436 --> 01:56:18.204
THEN WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:20.907
OPPORTUNITY. DECORATE BETTER

01:56:20.973 --> 01:56:22.642
HUMAN BEING BETTERS BETTER

01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:24.477
CITIZENS JUST LIKE THIS

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:28.147
GENTLEMAN HERE. SO THANK YOU.

01:56:28.214 --> 01:56:32.151
THANK YOU BONTA. I THINK THE

01:56:32.218 --> 01:56:34.153
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:35.688
WE FOR DECADES HAVE BEEN OVER

01:56:35.755 --> 01:56:37.590
INCARCERATING AND UNDER

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:39.525
REHABILITATING THE FACT THAT

01:56:39.592 --> 01:56:42.228
WE'VE ONLY SPENT- IN OUR CDC ARE

01:56:42.295 --> 01:56:44.030
BUDGET 1% OF OUR BUDGET TOWARDS

01:56:44.097 --> 01:56:46.466
REHABILITATION IS ACTUALLY ONE

01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:48.601
OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE ISSUE

01:56:48.668 --> 01:56:50.403
NOT WHETHER OR NOT PROP FORTY

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:52.038
SEVEN EXISTS AND PROP FORTY

01:56:52.105 --> 01:56:54.073
SEVEN STILL DOES ALLOW AND

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:56.376
DOESN'T PREVENT PROSECUTORS FROM

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:59.078
CHARGING WHO WHEN WE PARTICIPATE

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.980
IN ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT FOR

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:03.583
FOUGHT WITHOUT. END AND FOR THAT

01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:06.919
REASON I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE

01:57:06.986 --> 01:57:10.890
NEED TO. AT REPEAL. OF A

01:57:10.957 --> 01:57:12.024
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED BY

01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:15.895
VOTERS. IN TWENTY TWENTY AND FOR

01:57:15.962 --> 01:57:18.731
THAT REASON I AM GOING TO OPPOSE

01:57:18.798 --> 01:57:23.102
THIS LEGISLATION. ANY OTHER

01:57:23.169 --> 01:57:27.940
COMMENTS. YOU MAKE CLOSEST KILEY

WITNESSES ON BOTH SIDES ON

01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:37.683
TESTIFIED TODAY- I DO NOT EXPECT

01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:39.218
ALL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO

01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:40.987
FULLY ADOPT MY WORLD WORLD VIEW

01:57:41.053 --> 01:57:42.622
WHEN IT COMES TO MATTERS OF

01:57:42.688 --> 01:57:43.689
PUBLIC SAFETY AND CRIMINAL

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:45.992
JUSTICE- BUT I WOULD ASK THAT

01:57:46.058 --> 01:57:47.960

01:57:48.027 --> 01:57:49.929
OUR TWENTY GENERAL ROB BONTA.

WHO SAID THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

01:57:51.964 --> 01:57:54.400
CHANGES I'D PROP FORTY SEVEN IN
