ROLE THEY'VE BEEN A VERY

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:41.294
VALUABLE ADDITION. IN NINETEEN

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:41.828
NINETY PROP ONE FORTY WAS

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:42.328
PASSED BY THE PEOPLE OF

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:42.862
CALIFORNIA THAT WAS VERY

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:43.730
SPECIAL INTERESTS TO TERM

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.899
LIMITS. STRICT LIMITS ON

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.367
EXPENDITURES BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.501
BUT ONE OF THE UNINTENDED

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.003
CONSEQUENCES OF PROP ONE FORTY.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.604
IS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.240
ANALYST'S OFFICE BUDGET WAS CUT

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:55.141
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY THERE

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:58.811
UNDERNEATH THE SAME BUDGET ITEM

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.114
AS THE LEGISLATURE AS A

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.514
DEPARTMENT OF THE

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.316
LEGISLATURE'S. NINE NINETY.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.852
YOUR PROP ON. THE LA OWES STAFF

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.155
WAS PRODUCED BY 60% THINK ABOUT

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.324
THAT OVER HALF. PRIOR TO NINE

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:16.462
NINETY. BUT WAIT NOT JUST A BUT

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:22.669
IT WAS DONE IN THE BILL.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.270
CREATION AND THEY WOULD GIVE A

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.271
PRICE OF THOSE BILLS SINCE THEN

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:25.905
THEY'VE BEEN THEY HAD TO LIMIT

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:26.506
THE SCOPE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:27.073
TO ONLY. BETTING ADVICE ON

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.574

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.141
LARGEST APPROPRIATIONS AND

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:28.875
BILLS. SO I DON'T THINK THAT

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:29.442
THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:30.343
LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THE LA

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.144

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.711
ANALYSTS AS THEY DID IN THE

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:32.278
NINETEEN SIXTIES AND TO GIVE

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.280
YOU SOME CONTEXT. THE STATE

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.950
BUDGET HAS GROWN BY OVER 5000%

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.117
SINCE THEN IN OTHER WORDS AND

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:40.253
OVER FIFTY TIMES AND THEY'RE

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.354

AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE BUT I MAKE

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.429

EXACTLY IT WOULD BE FUNDED BY

WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

PROPOSED AMENDMENT. DOES NOT

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.717
CHANGE THE CAP ON TOTAL

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:24.984
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THAT

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.753
TO BE A BUDGETARY DISCUSSION.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:27.987
WE HAVE HAD HISTORICALLY OVER

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.355
THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES VERY

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:30.590
PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:31.491
BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.826
AND THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.061
THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING IS

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.562
IN THE FUTURE IF MAYBE THE

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:37.597
RELATIONSHIP WAS NOT SO

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.098
HARMONIOUS THAT THIS MIGHT BE A

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.833
CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. AND I THINK

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.135
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.503
SHOULD DEAL WITH WHEN THE TIME

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:44.771
COMES BUT FOR THE MEAN TIME I

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.873
DON'T THINK IT'S HEALTHY. FOR

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.808
US TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.610
WE GOT 60% FEWER ANALYSTS THAN

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:53.346
WE DID. BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.715
IN A BUDGET THAT CONTINUES TO

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.116
GROW IN COMPLEXITY STATE

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:57.683
GOVERNMENT THE CONTINUES TO

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.053
GROSS. THIS IS A GOOD FOR ONLY

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.922
CAL ABOUT OUR LEGISLATIVE I

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:04.323
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIGHT.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.758
THAT NUMBER JUST. QUICK THINGS

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:08.561
BEFORE I GO TO DOCTOR PAN AND

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:10.196

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.538
HAVE PUT ON THE BACKS FRANKLY

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.807
THEY'LL ANNOUNCE THEIR-

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.308
ANALYSIS OF ALL THE BALLOT. IT

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.343
IS RENDON THAT'S IN. THE NUMBER

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:31.083
OF. KIDS THAT ARE ON. ALAN

GROSS THAT. WHATEVER FUTURE

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.929
ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE WILLING

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.964
TO UNDERSTAND ON THE IMPORTANCE

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.599
OF THE LA L. TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.068

BUT- BASICALLY ANY CURRENTLY

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:11.257
THE LA ANY DALY AS WITHIN THE

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.160

BUDGET FOR HOW MUCH THE LA ACT

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:16.929
I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.731
A GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF MONEY.

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:20.166
IS THAT YES SAID THAT THAT IT

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.400

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:23.803

DE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE LA IS

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.809
A TRANSFER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:33.479
IT'LL SHOW WAS ZERO IN THE

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.214
BUDGET ACT AND DAN IT'S

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:36.916
BASICALLY FROM THE OVERALL

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:38.184
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET MONEY GOES

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:40.086
FROM THERE. TO THE LA OUT RIGHT

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:44.223

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.992
OF THE BUDGET SO IT'S- SO IS A

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:46.525
UNILATERAL DECISION BY THE

LEGISLATURE HOW MUCH. GETS OUT

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.729
OF OUR ALLOCATION OR AS PART OF

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.230
THE BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT THE

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:53.766
GOVERNOR ALSO SIGNED SAID THIS

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.268
IS HOW MUCH WENT TO THE L. L.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.238
AGREEMENT BUT IT IS PART OF THE

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.274

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:07.213
THERE ANY PROVISION IN THIS

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.582
PARTICULAR A CPA THAT PREVENTS

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:11.884
THE LEGISLATURE IF WE WISH TO

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:13.920
ACTUALLY DESIGNATE PART OF

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:15.788
ALLOCATION TO THE LA IF FOR

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.723
SOME REASON NOW DURING A

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.526
