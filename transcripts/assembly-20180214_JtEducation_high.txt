COMMITTEES. AND WE'RE EXCITED TODAY TO TACKLE A VERY INTERESTING TOPIC RELATING TO STATEWIDE KID TO TWELVE EDUCATION GOVERNANCE AND CLOUD THE ISSUES INVOLVED REALLY DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE BEING HERE TODAY AND ALL THE FOLKS WHO'VE. PREPARED. I WOULD LOVE TO ASK THE SERGEANTS TO MAKE SURE WORK CALM THE MEMBERS SO SO WE GET EVERYONE HERE TO. HEAR THE THE GREAT DISCUSSION. I'M. WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE HEARING TODAY TO DISCUSS THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF OUR CURRENCY LEVEL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. WITH THE REST EDUCATION IN THE STATE SPECIFICALLY THE ROLE OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THE ROLE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. CALIFORNIA HAS A INTERESTING AND SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE. I'VE BEEN MANY STUDIES. RECOMMENDATIONS LAWSUITS BALLOT INITIATIVES. THERE IS A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT THAT ASKS WHO'S IN CHARGE. AND THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN REPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION EXCELLENCE STATES THAT EVERYONE IS IN CHARGE. AND NO ONE IS ACCOUNTABLE. SO WHERE DOES NOTEWORTHY POINT RIGHT NOW WHERE WILL BE AS WE KNOW ONE THING THAT THE ONLY THING WE KNOW. OF FOR SURE WITH THE CARDS EDUCATION GOVERNS IS THAT WE WILL HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR AND A NEW SUPERINTENDENT OF INSTRUCTION. AT THE SAME TIME NEXT YEAR AND I THINK THIS PROVIDES US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A DEEP DISCUSSION ABOUT GOVERNANCE ROLES WHILE KEEPING THE CONVERSATION FOCUSED ON. OFFICES AND STRUCTURES AND NOT THE INDIVIDUALS HOLDING THOSE OFFICES AND SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF TODAY'S HEARING ALL THAT WE MAY LEARN FROM IT. GOT A VERY FULL AGENDA AND I LIKE TO KEEP US ON TRACK ON TIME. WE ASKED MEMBERS TO TAKE TO GET HERE SEEMS A CANNON AND I ASKED MY MY FELLOW CHAIR AYE O'DONNELL IF YOU'D LIKE TO MEET PATH MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS. YES SIR THANK YOUAND GOOD MORNING AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS CONVERSATION AND OWNERS FIRST THANK SENATOR ALLEN INFECTIOUS ENTIRE TEAM. SOME OF WHOM ARE UP HERE UP FOR HELPING PUT TODAY TOGETHER AND ALSO. BUT COMMON SENSE MEDIA FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND AND AND. SOME OF THEIR IDEAS AND BRING US TO THIS. HEARING TODAY. LOOK TOWARD THE CONVERSATION AND. LOOK GOOD LOOKING REALLY STATE LEVEL GOVERNANCE AND ALL THAT INTERTWINES WITH STUDENT OUTCOMES. BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE FOCUSING ON HERE IS CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. IF THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO AT THE STATE LEVEL TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BE THE AND GOVERNMENTS OTHERWISE WE SHOULD BE DOING THEM. WITH FORCE NAM SO. AGAIN I THINK. CENTER AROUND AND IT'S FUNNY AT WHEN I LOOK IT. UP. EDUCATION GOVERNANCE'S STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT EVERYONE'S IN CHARGE BUT I HONESTLY EVERYONE'S ACCOUNTABLE. SO I THE GOOD WITH THE CONVERSATION TODAY. SO BAIT YOU BUDGET MISTER SHARON AND I DO ALSO WANT TO. EXTENDS GREAT GRATITUDE TO THE OUR INCREDIBLE EDUCATION. CHIEF CONSULTANT IN MORE BURKE WHO DID A GREAT JOB PUTTING THIS WHOLE THING TOGETHER AYE WE GET SOME PERSPECTIVES FROM ALL OVER THE CITY CALIFORNIA BUT WE ALSO I WILL HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND I'M EXCITED TO HAVE. FOLKS FROM THE EDUCATION COMMISSION OF THE STATES WHO WILL BE PRESENTING ALL OF THE LATER TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE WAY THE DIFFERENT STATES DO IT. POSSIBLE REALLY WILL BE DELVING INTO LOTS OF DIFFERENT IDEAS AND STRUCTURES AND AND TO HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME. SOME GOOD THOUGHTS COMING OUT OF HIS HEARINGS LET'S START WITH KENNETH AYE AYE CAPTAIN CABIN. COUPON OKAY SORRY. KENNETH COUPON IS SEEN FISCAL POLICY ANALYST WITH OUR LIST OF ANALYST'S OFFICE TO START US OFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING AYE CHERRIES AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ARE BUILDING UPON. YOUR OPENING REMARKS A CALIFORNIA'S ELECTED LEADERS AND THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN STUDYING DEBATING AND REFINING THE STATE SYSTEM A KEY TWELVE GOVERNMENTS FOR NEARLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS. I THINK ONE REASON GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN SUCH A STUBBORN ISSUE FOR YOU IS TO HEAR SIZE OF THE SYSTEM THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. MORE THAN SIX MILLION STUDENTS NEARLY A THOUSAND DISTRICTS MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS. I SAID TURNING TO PAGE ONE OF OUR HAND OUT. A STATE GOVERNANCE TODAY REALLY REVOLVES AROUND FOUR MAIN ENTITIES OF THE GOVERNOR WHO PROPOSES THE EDUCATION BUDGET TEN APPROVED IT VETOES BILLS. YOU AS THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES EDUCATION FUNDING AND THE NEXT DAY POLICY. ARE THE STATE BOARD WHICH IMPLEMENTS REGULATIONS. THAT IMPLEMENT STATE LAWS AND STATE SUPERINTENDENT WHO ADMINISTERS AYE EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. AND ALTHOUGH THAT SOUNDS LIKE A FAIRLY CLEAR DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES TO LAW. AND A LITTLE BIT PLAYER HERE IN PRACTICE. IN ADDITION THOSE FOUR DON'T INCLUDE NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER AGENCIES THAT HAVE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES IN SPECIFIC AREAS. I FOR EXAMPLE NO DISCUSSION OF TEACHER ISSUES WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A DISCUSSION OF THE WILL OF THE CUP COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. A SAW TURNING TO PAGE TWO A TODAY'S DISCUSSION REALLY BEGINS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE. AFTER SOME CONSIDERABLE DEBATE ABOUT THE FRAMERS OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST CONSTITUTION I DECIDED AT THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT WOULD BE AN ELECTED POSITION. I THROUGH STATUTE THE SUPERINTENDENT RECEIVED A MANY RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU WOULD STILL RECOGNIZE TODAY LIKE APART SCHOOL FUNDING. SUPERINTENDENT ALSO DIDN'T MANY DUTIES THAT TODAY WOULD BE DONE BY DISTRICT LIKE BUILDING SCHOOL BUILDINGS. THREE YEARS LATER THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. OF THE BOARD'S MEMBERSHIP INITIALLY CONSISTED OF STATE OFFICIALS COULD IN THE GOVERNOR STATE SUPERINTENDENT. AND LATER THE BOARDEXPANDED TO INCLUDE EVEN SOME LOCAL OFFICIALS LIKE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS LARGE COMPANIES. BY THE LEGISLATURE ALSO GAVE THE BOARD PRODUCT FOR EDDIE TO SET AND POWER TO SET REGULATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. OVER THE NEXT FEW GET DECADES THE BALANCE OF POWER SHIFTED A COUPLE TIMES. I DELEGATES TO CALIFORNIA SECOND CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION DECIDED THAT EDUCATION HAD BECOME TOO CENTRALIZED. AND THEY DECIDED THAT I HAD TO REMOVE MOST OF THE STATE BOARDS POWERS AND SHIFT THAT DOWN TO THE COMING. I OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES ARE AFTER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE. I STATE GOVERNANCE ALLEGE THEIR UP REVOLVED AROUND THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE BOARD OF EDUCATION AMENDED TO MORE OF AN ADVISORY BODY. I TURNING TO PAGE THREE OUR THE STATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT WE KNOW TODAY LARGELY. IN NINETEEN TWELVE I THAT YEAR THE VOTERS REPEAL THE PREVIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT HAD SPECIFIED THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE STATE BOARD. AS PART OF THAT SCENE CHANGE THEY ALSO GAVE THE LEGISLATURE THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE HOW APPOINT MEMBERS TO BE SELECTED. AT THAT TIME THE LEGISLATURE ONE OF THE BOARD THAT WOULD CONSIST MORE AT THE LAY PUBLIC. AND IT DECIDED TO MAKE ALL BOARD MEMBERS APPOINTEES OF THE GOVERNOR. HOW THE LEGISLATURE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN THE BOARDS OF A POWER AT THAT TIME? IT RESTORING THE BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO ISSUE RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND IT MADE THE BOARD RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICY. AND ALSO REQUIRED THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF THE POLICIES THAT THE BOARD HAD APPROVED. IN NINETEEN TWENTY AT THE LEGISLATURE COMPLETED ITS FIRST MAJOR REVIEW OF EDUCATION GOVERNANCE. EITHER PICK GRIPPED THE COMMITTEE REPORT CRITICIZED WHAT IT CALLED THE STATE'S DOUBLE HEADED SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE. AND IT PREDICTED THAT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE STATE BOARD AND THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS INEVITABLE. IT RECOMMENDED ABOLISHING THE POSITION OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT AND REPLACING IT WITH AN EXECUTIVE WHO WOULD BE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY THE STATE BOARD. OF THE LEGISLATURE NEVER TOOK UP THAT RECOMMENDATION BUT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES A NUMBER OF OTHER STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED AND NAY I'VE MADE SIMILAR RECOMMENDATIONS. ARE AS THE NINETEEN TWENTY STUDY. IN THREE CASES THE STATE GOT AS FAR AS PLACING A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON THE BALLOT BUT IN EACH CASE THE VOTERS ULTIMATELY REJECTED THE PROPOSED CHANGES. SO OVER THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF THE LEGISLATURE'S MADE A NUMBER OF SMALLER CHANGES TO STATE GOVERNMENTS. I BUT THE STATE A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE YOU KNOW TODAY HAD LARGELY A MERGED I BY THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS. TURNING TO PAGE FOUR OF THE STATE BOARD TODAY CONSISTS OF ELEVEN MEMBERS ALL APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. I THE CONSTITUTION ASSIGNS SIGNS THE BOARD TO TWO DUTIES ONE IS APPROVING TEXTBOOKS FOR USE IN GRADES ONE THROUGH EIGHT. AND THE SECOND IS APPROVING THE APPOINTMENT OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS FOUR SENIOR DEPUTY IS. STATE LAW GIVES THE BOARD MANY OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT I APPROVING STATEWIDE ACADEMIC STANDARDS IN CHRIST SUBJECT AREAS. I ADOPTING REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN STATE LAWS ARE THE LC FF SPENDING REQUIREMENTS ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT AUTHORITY BEING EXERCISED. AND HEARING WAIVER REQUESTS SUBMITTED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BOB PAGE FIVE GIVE YOU SOME SENSE OF THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. I THE CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES THAT POSITION AND REQUIRES IT TO BE ELECTED BY THE VOTERS BUT DOESN'T ASSIGNING SUPERINTENDENT ANY SPECIFIC DUTY. I THROUGH STATUTE THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN THE SUPERINTENDENT THREE MAIN GOALS. PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO MANAGE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ANOTHER DUTY AS TO SERVICE THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND SECRETARY OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND THE THIRD IS TO SERVE ON VARIOUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AS AN EX OFFICIO MEMBER. TO THE MOST NOTABLE TO BOARDS. BUT PROBABLY INCLUDE THE TRUSTEES AT THE UC AND CSU SYSTEMS. AS THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS MANY DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE ADMINISTERING STATE AND FEDERAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. A OVERSEEING SOME KEY STATEWIDE FUNCTIONS LIKE DEVELOPING CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS A STANDARDIZED DIDN'T ASSESSMENTS INSTRUCTION MATERIALS SCHOOL FACILITIES STANDARDS. AND OVERSEEING OUR SYSTEM OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE OFFICES OF EDUCATION. I TURNING TO PAGE SIX A STATE LAW THAT SETS FORTH THE BASIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE BOARD AND SUPERINTENDENT. I THE BOARD HAS THE AS THE LA PHRASES THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL QUESTIONS OF POLICY. AND THE SUPERINTENDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. ALTHOUGH THAT'S A FAIRLY CLEAR LINE ON PAPER I THINK IF YOU EXAMPLES WILL SHOW YOU HOW THOSE ARE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE SOMETIMES DISPUTED IN PRACTICE. IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE FOR EXAMPLE. THE STATE BOARD DIRECTED THE SUPERINTENDENT TO REPRESENT ITS OPPOSITION TO A BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN. SCHOOL DISTRICTS MORE AUTHORITY TO CHOOSE WHICH TEXTBOOKS THEY WANTED TO USE. I THE SUPERINTENDENTS I DECLINED TO CONVEY THAT OPPOSITION NOTING THAT I GREATER TREACHERY TEXTBOOKS IS ONE OF HIS CHOIR. APPLY A PART OF HIS QUICK PLATFORM. I THAT DISPUTE AND DENSELY ENDED WITH AN OPINION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO NOTED. THAT THE STATE THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIVES OF THE BOARD BUT THE BOARD CAN'T TAKE ANY ACTION TO REMOVE THE SUPERINTENDENT FOR FAILING TO COMPLY. PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN DISPUTE OCCURRED DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES I THE SUPERINTENDENT AT THAT TIME IT SHOULD MORE THAN A HUNDRED ADVISOR HE'S TELLING SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HOW TO INTERPRET STATE LAWS AND IMPLEMENT STATE PROGRAMS? I THE STATE BOARD CONTENDED THAT THOSE ADVISORIES REALLY REGULATIONS AND THAT THEY UNDERMINE THE BOARDS WILL AS A POLICY MAKING BODY. I THEY INSISTED THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT CLEAR ALL ALL OF THOSE ADVISERS WITH THE BOARD FIRST I WHEN THE SUPERINTENDENT AYE REFUSED AYE THE TO EIGHT THE TWO ENTITIES AND THAT UP IN COURT. IN AND EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES APPELLATE COURT DECISION THE COURT RULED AT THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT. UNDER STATE LAW MUST FOLLOW THE BOARD'S LEAD ON ALL ISSUES OF POLICY. AND FINALLY A DISPUTE IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THAT CONFUSION THAT CAN OCCUR AMONG THE FIELD WITH THOSE ENTITIES DON'T AGREE. ARE AT THAT TIME OF THE VOTERS SAID JUST APPROVED PROPOSITION TWO TWO SEVEN. AYE WHICH ACQUIRED ENGLISH LEARNERS TO BE TAUGHT IN ENGLISH AND RESTRICTED BILINGUAL PROGRAMS. I THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT ISSUED AN OPINION THAT THIS THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE JUST PART OF THE EDUCATION CODE. AND THE STATE BOARD COULD WAVE TO HIM AS IT COULD WITH ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW. SOME DISTRICTS ARE PUT TOGETHER THEY WAIVERS AND WENT TO THE STATE BOARD BUT THEN THE STATE BOARD DECLINED ISSUE THEM ISSUING A DIFFERENT OPINION THAT FOUND THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY TO WAIVE INITIATIVES APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. I SAID TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN. OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS FIVE MAJOR STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED KEY TWELVE GOVERNANCE AND MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A FIREMAN. I IN BROAD STROKES ALL OF THOSE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE CURRENTS ACTUALLY HAS SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS. I THE FIRST MAJOR CONCERN WAS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM A LACKS CLEAR LINES OF AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY. HAVING MULTIPLE GOVERNANCE ENTITIES MEANS THE PUBLIC HAS DIFFICULTY HOLDING ANY ONE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATIONAL QUALITY AND RESULTS. A THINK THAT LINE WAS A CONCERN IS BEST EXPRESSED BY THE LINE THE CHAIRMANSHIP AT THE BEGINNING. JUST THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN REPORT A AYE WHICH CONCLUDED THAT THE PROBLEM WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT EVERYONE IS IN CHARGE AND NO ONE IS ACCOUNTABLE. THE STUDIES ALSO RAISED CONCERNS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT PROMOTE COHERENT POLICY MAKING. I THE GOVERNOR THEY NOTED THAT THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATURE AND STATE BOARD ALL RELY ON THE SUPERINTENDENT IMPLEMENT THE POLICIES. BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT IS ELECTED INDEPENDENTLY ANSWERABLE TO A DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCY AND MAY HAVE DIFFERENT POLICY PRIORITIES. I FINALLY ALL OF THE STUDIES I. CITED MANY EXAMPLES OF DUPLICATION FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR OFTEN APPOINTS I THEIR OWN EDUCATION GOVERNOR'S OFTEN APPOINT THEIR OWN EDUCATION ADVISERS. WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE I DONE BY THE STATE BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SO TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT OF THE STUDIES I MAKE A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS. AND. OFF FIVE REALLY ENVISION A. THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE THERE SORT OF CLEAR HEAD OF THE STATE'S EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. AND WHAT THAT TENDERLY GENERALLY TENDS TO MEAN IS THAT SOME OR EVEN ALL. OF THE POLICY MAKING AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS THAT TDAY ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE STATE BOARD AND OTHER AGENCIES. I WOULD BE CONSOLIDATED INTO AN OFFICE THAT REPORTS TO THE GOVERNOR. I REGARDING THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE STUDY'S RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY FOR A LONG SPECTRUM. ARE THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX STUDY CALLED FOR THE MOST DRAMATIC CHANGE IT RECOMMENDED ABOLISHING THE POSITION OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. AND REPLACING IT AYE WITH SOMEONE WHO'D BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR HOW TO PERFORM ALL OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. BY THE OTHER TWO STUDIES RECOMMENDED RETAINING ELECTED SUPERINTENDENT BUT MAKING THIS POSITION RESPONSIBLE FOR SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY. I UNDER THIS AYE RECOMMENDATION THE SUPERINTENDENT WHICH REALLY ENVISIONED AS SORT OF AN INDEPENDENT VOICE FOR SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT WITH SPECIFIC DUTIES. THAT MIGHT INCLUDE A COLLECTING AND PUBLISHING ACCOUNTABILITY DATA. IDENTIFYING LOW BUT LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS OVERSEEING ASSISTANCE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND ISSUING REPORTS TO THE PUBLIC ON HOW WELL THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS PERFORMING. AT THE FINAL TWO STUDIES RECOMMENDED MORE MODEST CHANGES SO THEIR PROPOSALS I RETAIN THE SUPERINTENDENT TWIST MUCH OF THE POSITIONS CURRENTLY ALL. I WITH SOME REFINEMENTS TO CLARIFY RESPONSIBILITIES AND STE AND ONLY A JUST A FEW QUID ADEQUATE NATION I TYPE FUNCTIONS TRANSFORM TO THE GOVERNOR. RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE STATE BOARD ALSO FELL ALONG SPECTRUM I TO STUDY IS RECOMMENDED COMPLETELY ELIMINATING THE BOARD'S POLICY MAKING POWER IS AND RECONSTITUTING THE STATE BOARD AS A BODY THAT WOULD. ADVICE THE GOVERNOR ON KEY EDUCATION ISSUES. I TO ABOUT ONE STUDY ENVISIONED IT NARROWING THE BOARD'S AUTHORITY BY ELIMINATING BOTH OF ITS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT AND BUT ALLOWING IT TO DO TASKS THAT THE LEGISLATURE EXPLICITLY ASSIGNED TO IT. AND I THE FINAL TWO STUDIES RECOMMENDED MAINTAINING THE BOARDS CURRENT GOAL AS A REGULATORY BODY THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. ALSO TURNING TO THE FINAL PAGE OF OUR HAND OUT LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH JUST A FEW CLOSING. THOUGHTS AS YOU THINK ABOUT POTENTIAL GOVERNANCE CHANGES. I THE FIRST IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON YOUR ABILITY TO CHANGE THE KEY ACTORS IN THE SYSTEM. OF THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES BOTH THE STATE BOARD AND STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE VERY BROAD AUTHORITY TO CHANGE THE RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THOSE ENTITIES. NEARLY ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF STATE GOVERNANCE RANGING FROM THE METHOD OF SELECTING THE STATE BOARD TO SPECIFIC DUTIES OF EACH ENTITY. AYE THINGS THAT YOU COULD CHANGE THROUGH MODIFYING STATUTE. AND FINALLY. CONSIDER YOUR TRADE OFFS. I THE PRINCIPLE I THINK BEST REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS A DIFFUSION OF EXECUTIVE POWER. I MOST BY DESIGN THE CURRENT SYSTEM REQUIRES ALL OF THE MAIN ACTORS TO AGREE ON MOST MAJOR POLICY CHANGES. WHAT THE FIVE STUDIES HAVE ADVISE YOU TO DO BY CONTRAST IS FOCUSED MORE? ON SOME OTHER PRINCIPLES LIKE HAVING CLEAR LINES OF AUTHORITY BY HAVING TRANSPARENT DECISION MAKING AND ELIMINATING ARE OVERLAPPING FUNCTIONS. SO WITH THAT OVERVIEW I CHAIR NUMBERS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WELL THANK YOU. BUT EVEN WE START WITH ONE. RELATING TO THESE THESE STUDIES. HAN. SO THIS PARTICULAR STUDY THAT ASKED FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE BOARD'S POLICY MAKING POWERS RECONSTITUTION AS AN ADVISORY BODY. AND. WHO WOULD THEN MAKE POLICY THE POLICIES UNDER THAT STEADY WHO WOULD THEN MAKE THE POLICIES? THAT ARE CURRENTLY MADE BY THE BOARD. THOSE STUDIES ENVISIONED THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD A POINT TO HEAD OF AN AGENCY SAME WAY WITH OUR THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE HEADS OF OTHER AGENCIES AND THAT PERSON WOULD LEAD UP. NICELY A NEW AGENCY WITH THAT KIND OF POLICY MAKING AUTHORITY. CONSIDER THE WHOLE IDEA THAT IT IS IT'S JUST ASKING THE BROADER QUESTION OF WHY IT IS THAT WE HAVE THE SEPARATE BOARD. MAKING DECISIONS WHEN IN OTHER AREAS OF POLICY MAKING ITS DONE. IN A MORE HIGHER HOPE ROACH. YEAH SO THAT MEAN THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND PUBLIC HAS ITS ROOTS. NOW ALL THE WAY BACK IN IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE BUT. ON THAT THE DELEGATES AT THAT TIME SEEM TO WANT SOME. DISPERSION OF POWER THEY WERE CONCERNED AYE NOT JUST EDUCATION BUT IN OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET. ABOUT POWER BECOMING TOO CONCENTRATED IN ANY ONE AREA. I'M. AND IN SOME. OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE LATER CONSOLIDATED THAT BUT IN THE CASE OF EDUCATION IT'S ONE WHERE THE VOTERS HAVE REALLY NOT GONE FOR ANY MAJOR CHANGES. TO THAT SYSTEM SINCE THAT TIME HONOR. THIRD OF AND DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION INCENTIVIZE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SHOT FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. IN A IN A THAT HE. MAINLY WE'RE LOOKING AT SALACIOUS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT. STATE ENTITY STATE BOARD GOVERNOR SUPERINTENDENT. SO WHAT. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOU LOOK AT THIS AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD. S. REPORTS. WHAT'S THE IMPACT THEN DOES THAT HAVE. SORT OF DOWNSTREAM WE HAVE. NO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEN OF COURSE YOU. DON'T TO THE FRONTLINE TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS AND SO FORTH. THIS SORT OF CONFUSION AT THE TOP. THEN LEADS TO LET ME CONTINUE AT NW HAD CHEST EXPLORED THIS WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT. ULTIMATELY OF COURSE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN SO. IS THIS BASIS THAT HAPPENS THE TOP LACK OF CLARITY THESE FIGHTS THEY'VE HAD WHAT WHAT WHAT THEN. LEADS TO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON FOLKS PROBABLY CAN'T YOU KNOW I DON'T WHICH TEXTBOOK TO GET THAT. NO AND WHO KNOWS. THERE'S NO RATING SYSTEM FOR KIDS CAN CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. YEAH IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALL OF THE STUDIES ARE LOOKED AT AS WELL AND I THINK I SHOULD MENTION THAT MANY OF THE US GOVERNMENT STUDIES. PATTON ALTHOUGH THEY'VE FOCUSED ON OUR STATE GOVERNANCE MANY OF THEM HAD SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT LACK OF CLARITY AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR EXAMPLE. THAT WE NOTED I'M RECENTLY THAT THE MISSION OF THE COUNTY OFFICES IS REALLY UNCLEAR AND SO THAT'S AN AREA OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT AT MY DESERVE A CLOSER LOOK. WHAT MANY OF THE AYE SCHOOL REPRESENTATIVES I INTERVIEWED FOR SOME OF THE STUDIES SAID BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM AS THEY FELT LIKE THEY SOMETIMES RECEIVED CONFLICTING MESSAGES? MESSAGES ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD PRIORITIZE SO YOU WANT ME TO FOCUS ON. GRADUATION RATES CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP TEST SCORES SOME OF THE MEASURE. I'M SOMETIMES SUPERINTENDENT OF THE STATE WORD MAYBE THE MESSAGE IN THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE WOULDN'T ALL AGREE. AND SO THEY'D BE SAYING WELL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RECEIVING ALL THESE DIFFERENT MESSAGES AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEIR RANK THOSE PRIORITIES. THOSE ARE CLEARLY THAT IT LEADS TO CONFUSION LOCAL LEVEL ABOUT THAT. BUT DIRECTION AND AND THAT SOON THAT THERE MIGHT EVEN BE SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT EXAMPLE OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE DO BUDGETING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND GOVERNOR SAYS THIS IS MY PRIORITY AND SO ON THAT BUT THAT MIGHT. BE TAPPED TO MIGHT BE FUNDS ATTACHED TO HER. IT'S BETTER A IN THAT NAY OTHER QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF THE STATE BOARD ITSELF YOU DON'T DID PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT. HOW INDEPENDENT IS THE STATE BORDER APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR I MEAN? IS IT THEY SERVE IT WELL THE THE. TODAY HAVE TERMS THAT THEY SICKLY WHAT'S THE TO TURN OVER TRADITION OF THE OF THE STATE BOARD I MEAN IF THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY DIRECT TOOLS OF THE GOVERNOR ARE DO THEY HAVE SOME ENOUGH SOME INDEPENDENCE IN THE SENSE THAT TO OTHER APPOINTEES. YOU HAVE LIKE. ROB THAT JELLY TO CONSERVE OUT THEIR TERMS AND. AND SO YOU DON'T DO NOT GOVERNMENT COMING IN AND CLEANING HOUSE ESSENTIALLY IF BUT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR HOW. SO EXACTLY HOW INDEPENDENT STATE BOARD. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION TWO THERE I WOULD SAY MADE MORE INDEPENDENT AND SAY THE HEAD OF AN AGENCY. BUT NOT. FAR LESS INDEPENDENT IN THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW IS THE STATE PART MEMBERS SERVE FOUR YEAR STAGGERED TERMS. I SAW WHEN I GOVERNOR I'M COMING AND HAS A CHANCE TO SORT OF. NAME NEW. MEMBERS THE STATE BOARD OVER THE YEARS. I THE STATE BOARD ALSO HAS A MEASURE OF INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE A THEY ELECT THEIR OWN HEAD OF THE STATE BOARD SO THEY CHOOSE WAS GOING TO REPRESENT THEM. I'M KEY ISSUES AND THEY DO HAVE THEIR OWN ON ITS RELATIVELY SMALL WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT BUT DOESN'T STAFF MEMBERS WHO WORK FOR THEM. SO SOME INDEPENDENCE BUT NAM IT'S JUST MUCH DIFFERENT IN THE SUPERINTENDENT IS COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF THAT STRUCTURE. IS THE CLEAR FIVE WELL THE BOARD HAS A SMALL STAFF TECHNICALLY BUT YET IT'S THAT THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER TO SUPERINTENDENT TO ACTUALLY. OVERSEAS THE LARGER STAFF THE DEPARTMENT YES EXECUTABLE WORDS POLICIES ARE. YEAH SOME OF THE STAFFING I THINK IT'S BEEN. SORT OF FATAH MOVEMENT THE LAWS A LITTLE BIT NAM. SOME WAYS UNCLEAR ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS IN THE SUPERINTENDENT. AYE IS DIRECTED TO HAVE SORT OF CONTROL OF. OF ALL OF THOSE STAFF OF SAY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUT THE STATE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK UNDER THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE STATE BOARD. SO KIND OF WHERE THE LINE IS BETWEEN THE STATE POINTS GENERAL AUTHORITY AND THE SUPERINTENDENT SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY. IT'S ABOUT LESS CLEAR AND PRACTICE AND THE GOVERNOR IN RELATION TO ALL OF THIS THE STAFF AT CD IS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT. TO GOV GOVERNOR HAS A ROLE IN THAT I MEAN THAT'S THE GOVERNOR POINT STATE BOARD BUT ASIDE FROM THE STATE BOARD DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE CD STAFF. RIGHT LOSS WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS PRESENTATIONS SAY TEN YEARS AGO THE SITUATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE CONFUSED BECAUSE THE STATE USED TO HAVE A SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. I WHO WAS REALLY THE GOVERNOR'S POLICY STAFF THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF FORMER ROLAND LA. BUT BY HAVING THE GOVERNOR'S YEAR THEY EXERCISE A LOT OF. I INFLUENCE OVER THE DIRECTION OF POLICY I TODAY WE DON'T HAVE A STRUCTURE LIKE THAT MOST OF THE FORMER. HOT WHEELS OF THAT I SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE BOARD. ON BUT IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE ANOTHER GOVERNOR COULD APPOINT. AT BRING BACK THAT POSITION AND WE BACK BE BACK TO AN EVEN MORE CONFUSING GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. AND I JUST BAY NOTE THAT. IT MAKES A CHALLENGE IN TERMS COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC WHAT WE'RE DOING IN EDUCATION AND WHAT OUR STATE GOALS ARE WITH THIS CONFUSION AT THE TOP AS WELL. THANK YOU. YES I THINK YOU THINK YOU REALLY HISTORY LESSON HERE TO HIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO ME. KINDA WHINY THROUGH TIME AND SEEING HOW THESE THINGS HAVE DEVELOPED. SEEING WATER CONSTITUTIONAL THE POWERS WHAT AREN'T IS INTERESTING TO ME TO. I THINK WE SHOULD REMEMBER IN THIS ROOM TODAY THAT. SUCCESS HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE'S NOT ONE THING SACRAMENTO CAN DO. TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA REALLY IT'S THE JOB OF THIS THOSE OF US REALLY IN MY OPINION TO SET THE BAR. AYE PROVIDE RESOURCES AND HOLD SCHOOLS. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE AT THAT THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I COME FROM. SO THERE IS ONE PROPOSAL IN HERE THAT SCARES ME WHICH IS TURN ARE ALL OF THE DUTIES OVER BASICALLY TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND HAVE THEM. DIRECTOR STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION BECAUSE THERE ARE. ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN MICRO MANAGERS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE ME BEING THE ONLY ONE OUT OF THAT HA. HA JUST KIDDING JUST KIDDING. BUT I REALLY YEAH I MEAN CAN YOU IMAGINE IF. YOU KNOW WHAT ALREADY GOES ON RIGHT HOW MANY BILLS DO WE DO WITH YOU HEAR ME ALL THE TIME. PEOPLE TRYING TO MICROMANAGE THE SCHOOLS FROM SACRAMENTO IS NOT A GOOD THING FOR A VARIETY REASONS BECAUSE WERE DIVERSE STATE IN MANY WAYS. BUT I GET YOUR POINT HOOSIER REALLY SAYING IS THAT. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION INSTRUCTION IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S WE JUST ELECTED. DEPARTMENT HEAD. OTHER THAN THE BULLY PULPIT AND SOME FORMAL DUTIES. THERE ARE MANY. POWER IS INHERENT IN THAT POSITION IS THAT CORRECT. THINK THAT'S RIGHT IT'S REALLY MEASURE WE WHERE I WAS THINKING BEFORE IT THE HEARING STARTED IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER PARALLEL TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND I CAN'T THINK OF A GOOD ONE IT'S REALLY KIND OF. STRUCTURE THAT CALIFORNIA SET UP JUST TO MANAGE ITS EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THIS MAYBE YOU DON'T BUT. ARE THERE OTHER STATES I DO DIFFERENTLY THAT. THAT MAYBE THEY'D THE CHANGE IN THE STUDENT SUCCESS YOU HAVE A GREAT SECOND PANEL I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THEM ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THE UPS AND GREAT INFO FOR YOU. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELL I DO APPRECIATE THIS I I'D LOVE THE GUY. DO YOU DO YOU HAVE CITATIONS FOR THE VARIOUS STUDIES THAT YOU REFERRED TO SO WE CAN. YES ABSOLUTELY UNHINGED TOM. I SEVEN EVER HAND OUT OF THE LIST OF THE FIVE STUDIES AND I BELIEVE MOST OF THEM ARE IN YOUR COMMITTEE PACKETS AND IF THERE ARE ANY THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT IN THERE I'M WILL HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU STEP. BY COUNTY I GOTCHA OKAY PERFECT. AND. BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ON THIS FOR TEN YEARS. THAT'S RIGHT THE LAST MAJOR STUDY WAS THE LITTLE WHOEVER I COMMISSION REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. OKAY. OKAY VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT IN AND THEN I THINK THAT. CHAIR O'DONNELL'S QUESTION IS A PERFECT SEGUE TO THE NEXT. PANEL WILL BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO HEAR FROM. DIFFERENT STATES AND LEARN A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THEIR STRUCTURE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU CAN OF THE DEPRECIATION. SO WE GOT HUNTER REALLY WHO'S A POLICY RESEARCHER WITH THE EDUCATION COMMISSION OF THE STATES ALSO JULIE ROWAN WOODS WHO SAW SENIOR POLICY ANALYST. WITH HIS HIS COMMISSION COMMISSION THE STATE'S WHICH IS BASICALLY CONSORTIUM. OF EDUCATION LEADERS FROM THE FIFTY STATES TO GET TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT EDUCATION POLICY QUESTIONS. THAT THEY'RE VERY STATES ARE FACING IN THIS OF COURSE IS ONE OF THEM HOW TO STRUCTURE GOVERNANCE. IN THE EDUCATION SPACE AND WE LOVE TO HEAR. FROM. MISTER RAILEY MISS WOODS WHO WILL GIVE US PERSPECTIVES FROM. OTHER. STATES. WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE I GUESS YOU'RE ALL IN FROM DENVER. AND TESTING GUELPH LEAH IT'S A LITTLE COLD HERE BUT PROBABLY AS CLOSE AS THEY'RE KNOWN I SHOULD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY A AS THE CHAIRMAN MENTIONED I'M JULIE WOODS AND THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE HUNTER RAILEY WE ARE FROM THE EDUCATION COMMISSION OF THE STATES. AND JUST AS A REMINDER WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS TODAY AS WELL AS AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WORK. SO ALTERNATE OVER HUNTER TO TALK TO US ABOUT GOVERNANCE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS HUNTER REALLY AND I'M A POLICY RESEARCHER FOR THE EDUCATION COMMISSIONOF THE STATES LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR PROVIDING US ME WHAT THE TIME TO DISCUSS STATE EDUCATION GOVERNANCE THIS MORNING. BEFORE WE START. I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION COMMISSION OF THE STATES. WE ARE NONPARTISAN ORGANIZATION AND DO NOT ADVOCATE FOR AGAINST ANY POSITION ON WE'RE JUST HERE TO SERVE YOU AS YOU TO BE THIS ISSUE TODAY. WE PROVIDE OBJECTIVE INFORMATION TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WITH WHICH SOLVE YOU AND I WERE THE ONLY ORGANIZATION WITH THE NATIONAL VIEW ON THESE ISSUES ON THEN WE DO THIS THROUGH RESEARCH REPORTS. AYE COUNCIL INCONVENIENCE. ON DECEMBER REFILL OUR VIEW OF WHAT ALL DISCUSSED TODAY. DISTANT OVERVIEW OF GOVERNANCE WHAT WE MEAN. ONE LEASE SAY GOVERNMENTS WHAT ALL THAT ENTAILS AND WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT. FOLLOWED BY A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE CORE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES NATIONWIDE THERE'S FOUR. COURSE STRUCTURES ON AND SOME VARIATIONS IN ALL THE. ADDRESS SOME OF THE TRADE OFFS VERY BRIEFLY. FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF THE. RECENT CHANGES AND SOME CONTENT POTENTIAL CHANGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN OTHER STATE HOUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ON AND OFF FINISH WITH SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON SOME QUESTIONS FOR ORIENTING YOUR APPROACH AND. JUST SOME IDEAS TO KEEP IN MIND. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. SO. WHAT IS GOVERNANCE OUR GOVERNANCE'S AND? AS WE DEFINED IT IS THE PROCESS OF MAKING DECISIONS CREATING AND ENFORCING RULES. AND DELIVERING SERVICES. THAT'S A BROAD DEFINITION IN RURAL VARY DEPENDING ON THE ENTITIES SERVICE BEING PROVIDED OR THE POPULATION UP BEING ADDRESSED. ON THAT INCLUDES STEPHAN. THAT DEFINITION INCLUDES BOTH INPUTS AND OUTPUTS. BOTTOM. DECISIONS ARE MADE ACROSS OUR IN COORDINATION WITH A VARIETY OF INSTITUTIONS SO THAT IMPLIES MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS ARE INVOLVED SO ONE WORK. SPEAKING ABOUT K. TWELVE EDUCATION IT'S NOT JUST THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WHO HAS OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OR. IS INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS. PALM INSTITUTIONS MAY ONLY HAVE PARTIAL JURISDICTION OR HAVE A DISCRETE FUNCTION AND. CREATING RULES ARE DELIVERING SERVICES. AND THAT FREQUENTLY INVOLVES A COMBINATION OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL PROCESS SEASON NORMS. FORMAL NORMS AND PROCESS EASIER ESTABLISHING LAW RULES AND REGULATIONS. INFORMAL NORMS VARY BY INTERACTION. THE PROFESSIONALS IN EACH OF THOSE ROLES AND. THE CONTEXTUAL OMENS DRIVE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. ON. FOR OUR PURPOSES HERE THAT CAN COMPLICATE AYE RULE CLARITY. ROLE CLARITY EXCUSE ME AND IT BECOMES MORE CHALLENGING ONE INSTITUTIONS AND PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM NEW TASKS DIFFERENT TASKS. PARDON WITHIN THEIR RULES OR THE RULES TO REDEFINE. ON THIS PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON FORMAL NORM BY PROCESS SEASON NORMS WITH ADEN CONSTITUTIONAL STATUTORY RULES REGULATIONS. WHY DOES THIS MATTER? THIS. DEFINING THIS CREATES A CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION FOR HOW EDUCATION POLICIES ARE CREATED IN IMPLEMENTED. THAT HELPS FRAME THE ISSUE AND ALLOWS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR RESOLVING THOSE ISSUES. PALM IT DEVELOPS A COMMON STARTING POINT FOR DISCUSSING GOVERNANCE ISSUES AND OTHER EDUCATION POLICIES SO JUST SIT THE HELP YOU ORIENT YOURSELVES. AND IT HOPES THAT THIS GROUP WAS SET GOALS AND MANAGE EXPECTATIONS ON HAS. HAS KIND OF ARTY BEEN ALLUDED TO THERE'S. ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU GOT RESTRUCTURED GOVERNANCE AT LEAST THAT WERE AWARE OF. I WAS SO THE CORE GOVERNANCE MODELS ON. THIRTY EIGHT STATES WILL FALL INTO ONE OF THESE FOUR CATEGORIES. THERE ARE AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE VARYING ALTERNATIVE METHODS AND THEY TEND TO BE HYBRID BUT THOSE PRIMARILY RELATE TO STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND. ARE NOT THE SUPERINTENDENT'S ROLE. WILL ONLY FOCUS ON STATE EDUCATION OF GOVERNANCE. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LOCAL LEVEL. BUT NOT TOO MUCH ON. LIMITED TO EDUCATION SPECIFIC ROLE SO NOTHING IN THESE MODELS LE. HAS INCLUDES THE STATE LEGISLATURE OR OTHER AGENCIES OUTSIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THAT. PALM IT'S A STARTING POINT FOR ANALYSIS BUT I IT DOES NOT INCLUDE SOME OF THE MORE HOW IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF EDUCATIONAL GOVERNANCE. AGAIN IT ONLY APPLIES TO K. TWELVE SYSTEMS NO HIGHER EDUCATION EARLY LEARNING OR OTHER STATE AGENCIES WITH OVERLAPPING IN A. POLICY AREAS. AND THAT FUNCTION VARIES BY DEGREE OF CONTROL AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS SO POLICY MAKING RULES VERY. FROM STATE TO STATE EVEN IF THEY ARE IN A SIMILAR STRUCTURE. AND STATES VERY BY DEGREE OF CONTROL AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. PITCH. BUT LIKE TO BE CLEAR THAT THERE'S NO BEST MODEL THAT WE ARE AWARE OF IN TERMS OF PROVIDING A PUBLIC EDUCATION. IN THE MODELS AS. YOU'LL SEE ONE ODD. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. ASSUME VOTER ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS BUTTERS UNDERSTAND. WHAT? WHO'S IN CHARGE ON THEN WHO THEY CAN HOLD. ACCOUNTABLE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES. SO. BRIEFLY I WANT I DISCUSS THESE ALL WORK FROM THE TOP DOWN STARTING WITH THE ELECTORATE AND WORKING DOWN INTO THE INDIVIDUAL ROLE SO. AND MODEL ONE VOTERS SELECT THE GOVERNOR ON THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THE CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICER. AND THIS CREATES A STRONG EXECUTIVE BRANCH. IN THE EDUCATION ARENA. IT ALLOWS EXECUTIVES. TUBES ARE A LOT OF CONTROL OVER EDUCATION POLICY AND IT LEAST IN THEORY IT WOULD CREATE A CLEAR CHAIN OF COMMAND. HOWEVER THE SUCCESS AND FAILURE. EDUCATION POLICIES ARE TIED TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY CLARIFY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR POLICY PRIORITIES AND IN THE SENSE THAT THERE'S A. GOVERNOR WHO IS DISENGAGED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT MAY ACTUALLY MUDDIED UP THE SYSTEM. I NEED TO THE STATES THAT. USE MODEL ONE. AND I'M SURE YOU SEE IT WOULD MONEY SYSTEM OTHER JUST IF A GOVERNOR IS NOT ENGAGED OR. BASICALLY ALL MOST F THE. POLICY INFLUENCES WOULD BE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ALL OVER THIS AND IF THERE'S JUST NO CLEAR LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP THEN. ESSENTIALLY YOU HAVE WHAT WAS DESCRIBED HERE WHERE EVERYBODY'S. KIND OF DOING WHATEVER THEY A. FEELS BEST. MODERN. MODEL TO VOTER SELECT THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION PALM IN THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION APPOINTED CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICER. OTHER STILL STRONG EXECUTIVE ROLE ON THEM THE CHAMP COME COMMAND AT LEAST APPEARS CLEAR ON THIS ONE. THERE IS. SOME SEPARATION TWEEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION. IN THESE CASES THE EXECUTIVE AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PER BY DIRECT OVERSIGHT OVER IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION POLICY AND. AGAIN IF THE RULES ARE CLARIFIED LINES WE COUNT ABILITY ARE STILL UNCLEAR. IN THESE OF THE SEATS HUSING MODEL TO. A. MODEL THREE VOTERS SELECT THE GOVERNOR AND THE CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICER INDEPENDENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND. AS WAS MENTIONED HERE. CALIFORNIA HAS A NON PARTISAN CONTEST IT'S THE ONLY STATE WERE AWARE OF THAT EXPLICITLY HAS A NONPARTISAN HIGH RES MENTIONED AND LAW. WHEN THE GOVERNOR IN THE CC. CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICERS PRIORITIES ALIGNED THERE'S. THERE MAY BE A GREATER ABILITY TO INFLUENCE POLICY AND. PERIODICALLY CLEAR LINE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BOATERS SPECIFICALLY. HOWEVER THE MODEL RELIES ON POLICY PRIORITY ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE IN THE CHURCH ACHIEVE STATE SCHOOL OFFICER ON THE MORE COMPLEX MODEL THEM IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT MAKES. ISSUE IDENTIFICATION AND. RESOLUTION DIFFICULT IF THE RULES AREN'T ACTING IN CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER. THE STATE'S WITHOUT MONO. AND MODEL FOR MOTOR SELECT THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE BOARD OF. EDUCATION INDEPENDENTLY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION APPOINTS A CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICER. AGAIN MICHIGAN IS THE ONLY STATE THAT WERE AWARE OF THAT HAS A NONPARTISAN HOT RACES PALM HOWEVER. WHILE OTHER. ELECTIONS THEMSELVES ARE NONPARTISAN AND. STATE PARTY CONVENTION SELECT THE CANDIDATES SO. THIS ALLOWS THE STATE BOARD EDUCATION TO STEER POLICY PRIORITIES ON THEORETICALLY AGAIN CLEAR LINES OF ACCOUNTABILITY. IN DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND CONTEXTUAL ELEMENTS MAY DRIVE THE BEATS. DIFFERENT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE STATE BOARD. AND IT'S EASIER TO IDENTIFY IN THEORY WHO'S IN CHARGE. HOWEVER THE EXECUTIVE MAY NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR A POLICY PRIORITIES LIMITED ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT LARGER REFORMS I'M REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT FUNDING OR SUBSTANTIAL POLICY CHANGES MAY ALSO. BUT BE A DOWNSIDE TO THAT. ON. IN THOSE TWO STATES TOMORROW FOR. AND JUST SOME OF OUR RECENT GOVERNANCE CHANGES. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THESE ARE JUST AN OVERVIEW AND. TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR THE DISCUSSION ON. THIS REPRESENTS A BEST GUESS OF. ELISE FOR THE POLICIES THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED THIS YEAR OF. OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF PASSAGE OR. A WHETHER IN THE CASE OF NORTH CAROLINA WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT SUPREME COURT AYE CASE WILL BE. BUT. LAST YEAR INDIANA WITH EACH BE ONE ZERO ZERO FIVE CHANGE THE ROLE OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. AND TOOK. FROM AN ELECTED POSITION TO AN APPOINTED POSITION AFTER JANUARY TEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THAN THIS YEAR NEBRASKA IS CONSIDERING A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. NEW YORK IS SIMILARLY CONSIDERING ABOLISHING THE BORDER FOR BUT I REGION'S AND TRANSFERRING POWER. POWERS AND DUTIES TO THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. SOUTH CAROLINA IT HAS CARRY OVER LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR. CONSIDERING CHANGING SUPERINTENDENT OF FROM AN ELECTED POSITION TO. CABINET APPOINTED POSITION. AND AS I SAID. NORTH CAROLINA HAS. A COURTESAN FROM THE SUPREME COURT ON WHETHER LAWMAKERS CAN DIMINISH THE AUTHORITY OF THE APPOINTED STATE BOARD. ON IN INSTEAD GIVE UP BUDGETARY CONTROL TO THE CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICER. JUST SOME POLICY CONSIDERATIONS A THIRD FRAME ORIENT THE DEBATE. ON BEING AWARE OF THE IMPACT GOVERNMENT'S CHANGES MAY HAVE ON THE STATE AND LOCAL DYNAMIC ON THERE'S AN INHERENT TENSION. BETWEEN STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL DISTRICTS IT'S NOT UNHEALTHY IT'S JUST CONSTANTLY THERE. GOVERNANCE CHANGES WILL LIKELY CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC IN SOME WAY. BOB PORTER REASSESSING THE ROLE MAY MEAN RETHINKING AND BROADER TERMS OF THE ROLE OF STATES AND DISTRICTS. ESTABLISH CLEAR GOALS OUR VISION OF FOR APPROACHING GOVERNANCE CHANGES THAT MANAGING EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH OR WHAT THIS WILL IN FACT DO. IS IMPORTANT. AND FOCUSING THE DEBATE ON SIMPLY WILL. THE KEY TOPICS ARE THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SENSE OF. PERFORMANCE METRICS HOW WE KNOW IT THIS IS WORKING AND HOW WILL YOU KNOW THAT'S IMPROVING THINGS. ALSO CONSIDER OTHER HOW CHANGES ONE WITH YOUR STATE PLAN. INSURING DOES SO IMPLEMENTATION IS DONE. CORRECTLY. IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND OF BOYD CONFLICTING MANDATES AND PRIORITIES DURING THE INPUT IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW. AND. CLEARLY ESTABLISHED RULE SO. THAT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISCUSSION BUT CHANGING THE STRUCTURE DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ROLE CLARITY IS ACHIEVED. ADEN IN THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ROLES OR THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES WON'T CHANGE OVER TIME. RUN INTO SOME QUESTIONS. WHAT ARE THE CORE ISSUES YOU'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE? WILL PROPONENT PROPOSE SOLUTIONS ADEQUATELY RESOLVE THE ISSUE. HOW WILL PROPOSED SOLUTIONS IMPACT WORKING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG POLICY LEADERS? AND IS IT POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER THE LONG TERM AFFECTS OF A CHANGE. AND I'LL CONCLUDE WITH. JUST SOME RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE ON THIS ISSUE IF YOU WILL PA WANT MORE ON THE NATIONWIDE VIEW. THE STATE EDUCATION GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES UP THE IT EXPANDS ON SOME OF THE. JUSTIN MODEL. AND THE <u>&lt;c.green&gt; FIFTY STAY&lt;/c&gt;</u> COMPARISON ON K. TWELVE. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES WILL. HIGHLIGHTS THE. FORMAL CON CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY ROLE OF GOVERNORS LEGISLATORS. STATE BOARDS OF EDUCATION CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES OF THE STATE HOUSE ONE. THANK YOU. PQ. CARRIED ON. YES BUT THANK YOU VERY VERY. FORGET PRESENTATION WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNANCE MODEL. IS THERE ANY METRIC. ASSOCIATED. WITH THE CHANGE IN THE GOVERNANCE MODEL OR AN EXISTING GOVERNANCE MODEL. THAT POINTS TO WHAT GOVERNANCE MODEL WE SHOULD HAVE FOR AND METRIC ASSOCIATED WITH REALLY FROM TALKING STUDENT SUCCESS YOU HEARD ME TODAY I'M REALLY FOCUS ON STUDENT SUCCESS REALLY CALIFORNIA. CLOSING THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS CALIFORNIA WERE DOING BETTER THAN WE EVER HAVE YET WE HAVE MORE CHALLENGES. BUT WE'VE EVER HAD SO AGAIN IS THERE ANY METRIC ASSOCIATED WITH WITH. WITH LIKE WITH ANY SPECIFIC GOVERNANCE MODEL OR ANY SPECIFIC CHANGE. ANNA GOVERNANCE MODEL THAT'S QUANTITATIVE NOT NECESSARILY QUALITATIVE. BUT I'M SO THIS IS AN AREA OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND STUDENT OUTCOMES IS UNCLEAR AND IT'S JUST NOT VERY WELL RESEARCHED AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF VARIABLES IN BETWEEN YOUR STATE LEVEL GOVERNANCE AND. THE STUDENTS HOWEVER THERE IS ON. I'M AWARE OF AT LEAST ONE REPORT. THAT ACTUALLY STUDY CALIFORNIA TEXAS AND FLORIDA THAT KIND OF CAME UP WITH SOME. VERY GENERAL AREAS. THAT COULD BE USED TO ASSESS ON THE SO. IN THE RICH IN BROAD TERMS ON STABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY INNOVATION FLEXIBILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS TRANSPARENCY AND SIMPLICITY AND EFFICIENCY ARE OF THE CORE METRICS AND THEY USED ON. BUT THESE WEREN'T DONE WITH. CHANGES FROM SAY CHANGING FROM MODEL ONCE MODEL TO IT WAS JUST A SIMPLE ASSESSMENT OF WHERE THE CURRENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES STOOD. BUT SO TO PUT IT SHORTLY NOBODY ACTUALLY. KNOWS WHAT THE OUTCOME IS THAT THE STUDENT LEVEL ONCE YOU CHANGE THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. I'M GOOD PHD DISSERTATION I ASSUME VERY SOMEONE WHO NEED SOMETHING ORIGINAL MIGHT GO THERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION MEAN. YOU TALK ABOUT THE ORGANIZATIONAL BOXES BUT I GUESS THAT. YOU COUPLE QUESTIONS AROUND ELITE HAVE THE ANSWER TO THIS OR NOT. US SO ONES IN TERMS OF THE. DIFFERENT MODELS THEY HAVE AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT CORRESPOND IN ANY WAY TOO HOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE LOCALS OPERATE THAT STATE SO. LUCAS CERTAIN MODELS MAINLAND MORE TO A CERTAIN TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP ANOTHER. WITH SUCH A LOCAL ENTITIES. THAT OUR GOVERNING EDUCATION AND STATE SO YOU KNOW WE. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE WELL MULTI LAYERS AND WE'VE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT CETERA RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE ENTITIES AND THOSE ENTITIES. WHAT ONE MIGHT ARGUE AGAIN I DON'T KNOW? YOU KNOW SO. THAT DOES THAT IF THERE IS IF THE STATE HAS MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE LOCALS THIS THAT BAND SPEAKTO A PARTICULAR TYPE OF GOVERNANCE AT THE STATE THAT EITHER MAKES MORE EFFECTIVE ORDER TENDS TO LEAN. A CERTAIN WAY NO ONE COMMENTS PEOPLE HAVE MADE ABOUT CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY AFTER PROP THIRTEEN IS IS THAT WE EXERCISE THROUGH. BUDGETARY AUTHORITY AND WE HAVE MOVED. DECIDED TO MOVE TOWARD A MORE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA BUT. WE CAN BE VERY DIRECTIVE BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY CONTROLADA PURSE STRINGS VERSES. OTHER STATES WHERE ACTUALLY PERHAPS THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RAISE MORE OF THEIR OWN MONEY AND ARE LESS DEPENDENT ON THE STATE GOVERNMENT FOR. RESOURCES SELF AND IF YOU ANYONE LOOKED AT THAT ARE YOU CAN COMMENT ON ON HOUSE THE STRUCTURE MAY CORRELATE WITH RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR WHATEVER LOCAL ENTITY GOVERNS EDUCATION IN THAT PARTICULAR STATE. DONE SO AGAIN THIS ISN'T AN AREA THAT'S BEEN WIDELY STUDIED SO IN TERMS OF. THE IMMEDIATE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE'S A CORRELATION BETWEEN A LOCAL STRUCTURE IN THE STATE'S STRUCTURE. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT AND A LOT OF THE WAY. OF STATE AND LOCAL STRUCTURES HAVE DEVELOPED HAVE NOT BEEN. SO MUCH. INTENTIONAL DECISIONS BUT JUST WAIT THE WAY THINGS HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME. I WILL POINT TO. ONE STUDY TO SORT OF ADDRESS THE CENTRALIZATION VERSUS LOCAL CONTROL. WHERE? PERHAPS IN THAT THE DICHOTOMY NEED ISN'T. HOLY RELEVANT ANYMORE IN THE SENSE THAT IT THERE'S NO STATE THAT'S ENTIRELY LOCAL CONTROL AND ENTIRELY CENTRALIZE BUT. ON. THE STUDY I'M REFERRING TO ASSESS WHETHER CENTRALIZATION HELPS DO NOW COMES VERSES A LOCAL CONTROL. AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS ESSENTIALLY DONE YOU HAVE TO BE MORE NUANCED ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT THE STATE CONTROLLING HIM WAT YOU WANT OF LOCAL DISTRICTS CONTROLLING. ON AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT SORT OF COME SOUND TO. WHAT ALLOWS A? LOCAL DISTRICTS TO FOCUS ON STUDENTS AND WHAT ASPECTS. CAN THE STATE'S TAKE OFF ON THE DISTRICTS MY A PLATE. OKAY. AND THE. OTHER QUESTION IS IN RELATION TO. ITEM IT'S YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE. BOB SO YOU MADE THE COMMENT THAT FOR EXAMPLE MODEL ONE WHERE BASICALLY THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS EVERYBODY. THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT IT'S YOU KNOW DODD VT DIRECTION EDUCATION POLICY DEPENDS ON WHAT PRIORITY THE GOVERNOR GIVES OF THE GOVERNOR. MAKES A VERY LOW PRIORITY THEN IF THERE'S. VERY LITTLE EMPHASIS RIGHT. IF THE GOVERNMENT'S A HIGH PRIORITY TO DRIVE A LOT OF CHANGE BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS GOOD POINT. BY THE GOVERNOR. SO I I GUESS THE THE THE QUESTION IS IS THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS ACTUALLY LOCAL AREAS AS WELL SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. EDUCATION IS SOMETHING THAT IS pPOPULACE. BUT. IF EDUCATION IS SEPARATED FROM LET'S SAY THE GOVERNOR AND ALLEGE THE OF THE GOVERNOR. DE DO YOU SEE. THE. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BEING I WOULD SAY LESS INTERESTED BUT LESS ENGAGED AND THEREFORE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT EASE AFFECT EDUCATION NOT JUST. EDUCATION DIRECTLY YOU SEE LESS COORDINATION BUT SAY BETWEEN EDUCATION AND OTHER PARTS OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS. AB BECAUSE THOSE. FOLKS ARE SEPARATED AND A LATE AT NIGHT BLADES GIVE YOU MAY PRESS LOCALS AND SOMETIMES FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE SEEN MARES WHO DON'T OVERSEE THEIR LOCAL EDUCATION TRIED INSERT THEMSELVES IN EDUCATION. AT TIMES. BECAUSE BATES FEEL THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE THEIR DIALECT IT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. OR YOU COULD HAVE SAVED YOU HAVE OFFICIALS AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW EDUCATION ISN'T PART OF MIND IT SEPARATELY ELECTED SEPARATELY APPOINTED WHATEVER AND THEREFORE EVEN THOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THEY JUST GO OFF ON THEIR OWN SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HOW THE STRUCTURES THAN INFLUENCE HOPE WHAT PRIORITY A. GOVERNOR MAKES EDUCATION SO THERE'S THE PARTNER THE PART ABOUT WELL IF EVER IF EVERYTHING'S APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNMENT IS A CARE ABOUT EDUCATION THAT CARE BUT DOESN'T A HIGH PRIORITY TACTIC LANGUISH BUT ALSO A SERIOUS SITUATION WHERE. THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER IS IS ENOUGH OVERSIGHT OF EDUCATION ARTS ARE PARSED OUT TODAY AND THERE'S LESS. OF A DESIRE ARE LESS. INTERESTED IN ARE AT IT IN IN BAD AND THE GOVERNOR AND TRYING TO PURSUE EDUCATIONAL PRIORITIES. BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LESS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THAT. SO AGAIN IT'S LOW DIFFICULT TO SAY JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR ISN'T MUCH RESEARCH ON THIS AYE. I MEAN WHEN I SAY THERE IS A OF THE GOVERNOR MAY BE LESS INTERESTED I THINK THEY MAY BE LESS INTERESTED IN THE SENSE THAT THEY CAN. MOON MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE LIKE MORE AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR WHERE THEY SEE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM GOING I THINK IT'S A HILL LEAST AT THE STATE LEVEL EDUCATE. K. TWELVE IS A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE BUDGET SO THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE. SOME INTEREST IN AND. BUT I THINK WHERE IF. TO ANSWER THE BEST I CAN THE ONLY. THE DISTINCTION WILL BE WHETHER THEY CARE ABOUT. YOU KNOW TAKING A. FOR INSTANCE IN COLORADO LIKE. P. THREE READING AND THE. OR DOES SOMETHING A BIG POLICY INITIATIVE LIKE THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL SEE THAT DISTINCTION. SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE PERHAPS MORE WORK TO. LET INFORMED DECISIONS MIGHT BE NECESSARY YES OKAY. STATE OF. THANKS FOR A FOR THE PRESENTATION I SOCIAL TO FOLLOW UP ON CHAIR. O'DONNELL'S QUESTIONS EYES SO I I BELIEVE YOU SAID THERE IS NO REAL EVIDENCE OUT THERE IS TO. TO RELIABLE POINT TO WHETHER ONE OF THESE FOUR PREVAILING MODELS WORKS BUT AND OTHERS THAT RIGHT. SO CALIFORNIA WERE TO MAKE. SOME SORT OF CHANGE THAT WOULD NOT BE ON THE BASIS OF REALLY ANY RELIABLE EXISTING EVIDENCE. NOT ANY QUANTIFIABLE EVIDENCE THAT I'M AWARE OF. A CAT. AND SO I WON THE RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK WAS TO ESTABLISH AYE METRICS GOING FORWARD IF WE WERE TO CREATE OUT WORD BEFORE FOR THE CHANGE A MANY SIDED ONE STUDY THAT HAD. SOMEONE I THINK DESCRIBES METRICS BUT THERE SEEM TO BE MORE TO ME LIKE IDEALS LIKE SIMPLICITY AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS UP FOR WHAT THOSE METRICS OUGHT TO BE. UN SO NOT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DO THINK. GOING BACK. IN TERMS OF THE SALAS SHIRLEY ESTABLISHING A GOAL OR VISION FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING SO. I TO GIVE YOU A SENSE. IS THERE'S YOUR* CONSTANTLY BOUNCING PRIORITIES SO DO YOU WANT THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS TO BE MORE EFFICIENT YOU WANT TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT YOU WANT. BETTER CHECKS AND BALANCES THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO DICTATE WHETHER YOU WANT TO MAKE-A CHANGE OR YOU WANT TO JUST. UP PERHAPS PROVIDE MORE CLARITY IN. EXISTING ROLES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. ON MY SUGGEST IF I HAD IS SUGGESTION IT'S SIMPLY JUST TO. CONSIDER WHAT YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES AND THEN. DETERMINE WHAT THE KEY METRICS WILL BE FROM THERE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD TO ASSESS. WHAT EVEN? HOW YOU WOULD? QUANTIFY A GOOD GOVERNMENT SYSTEM JUST BECAUSE. IN A LOT OF CASES THESE ARE BASED ON. VALUES JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW YOU WANT THE EXISTING LOCAL AND STATE DYNAMIC TO BE OR. WHAT YOU WANT STUDENT OUTCOMES TO HOPEFULLY LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AND HOW THE STATE WILL SUPPORT IT? WELL APPRECIATED I ALSO WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THAT AND. YOU'VE GOT OF EXCELLENT FIFTY STATE REVIEW THAT CAME OUT LAST YEAR THAT'S AND EVANS PACKETS AND I THINK SOME OF THE MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY REVIEW IT EARLIER BUT IT BASICALLY OUTLINES MOST OF WHICH YOU PRESENTED. BUT HE'S VERY STRUCTURES AND DOWN. YOU KNOW IT'S A. EXAMPLES OF THERE'S NO PERFECT WAY TO DO THIS SO WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR. COMING TO US WITH THESE REYES MODELS AND I THINK THAT TERADATA HAS A DISMAL COMMENT IS A COMMENT HERE JUST KIND OF. THIS IS JUST I'M GONNA ME THINKING BEHIND THE RAIL HERE HAVING BEEN A TEACHER IN THE POSSIBLE TWENTY TWO YEARS. I I JUST WANNA BE CAREFUL IF YOU LOOK AT THE MINE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY WE CAN DRIVE ALL THE SUCCESS FROM SACRAMENTO HE SAID VERY MUCH CONCERNED TAKE AS WE TRIED THAT. OKAY WHAT ABOUT. BUT EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WE CAME AND WE SAID OKAY. STATE BOARD ADOPTED LIKE THERE WERE TWO ADOPTIONS AND ONE WAS COMMON CORE ONE WASN'T MOUSE YOU LITERALLY HAD. TEACHERS ON PAGE FOUR. RIDE IN ON TUESDAY YOU NO NO FOR THE EVERY TEACHERS ON PAGE FOUR AND THEY WERE SCRIPT WAS THE WORST IN OPEN COURT THEIR SCRIPTED. YEAH LESSONS THEY READ OUT WHAT THEY HAD TO READ STUDENTS LITERALLY SAT. IN A ON A CARPET AND ALL HAD A NUMBER IT WAS VERY REGIMENTED. WE TRIED THAT APPROACH AND IT DIDN'T WORK. BUT WE DID WAS WE WE MICROMANAGE FROM SACRAMENTO SO ON TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT. THAT WORKS BECAUSE WE TRIED IT. AND NOW WE'RE UNDER THE ERA OF LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA COUNTRY YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH. AND IT'S UST PER WORD WE'RE TRYING ANOTHER APPROACH WERE TRYING TO GET THERE. BUT I JUST DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO ONE THING WE CAN DO IN SACRAMENTO. TO MAKE. MAKE EVERY CHILD SUCCESSFULLY CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS CANNOT HAPPEN IN THE CLASSROOM IT'S GOTTA HAPPEN AT LOCAL LEVEL. AND IT CAN'T ALL BE DRIVEN FROM SACRAMENTO. ED I JUST ONE OF THE THING TO POINT OUT ON. A DATE DUBS AGREE WITH THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS. ONE OF THEM TO POINT AS THE YOU ALSO MEDITATING ONLY THIRTY FOR THE STATE'S FIT INTO ONE OF THE FOUR MODELS YOU DESCRIBED. BUT THERE OF COURSE. SIXTEEN OTHER STATES AND AND I THINK YOU LAME OUT PRETTY NICELY ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR REPORT OTHER GOVERNMENTS MODELS AND THE THE BUT WITH A. RANGE FROM. GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND SPEAKER APPOINTING MEMBERS THE STATE BOARD AS THEY DO IN MISSISSIPPI RIGHT THE WAY OVER TO THE COME HYBRID MODELS WHERE YOU'VE GOT. PART OF THE BOARD ELECTED PART OF THE BOARD APPOINTED AS A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS OUT THERE BUT TEN BUT ULTIMATELY AFRAID I MEAN IT'S IT'S. I GUESS THE QUESTION WE HAVE IS HOW DO YOU CREATE A STRUCTURE THAT WILL PASSED. ALLOW FOR THE THE SORT OF I GOT YOU A FLOWERING FITTED TO. THERE'S ALSO JUST GIVE I COULD JUST IF WE GO BACK TO HISTORY PROBABLY PRE PROP THIRTEEN THE DYNAMIC IN SACRAMENTO WAS PROBABLY VERY DIFFERENT. BECAUSE THE FUNDING MODEL WAS DIFFERENT MOST OF THE MONEY CAME APPROVED CAME FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO EVEN LOCALS PROBABLY DIDN'T SEE GOVERNANCE OR A MUCH INPUT FROM THE SACRAMENTO LEVEL NOW THAT SACRAMENTO'S IN CHARGE OF THE DOLLARS THEY'RE SEEKING TO HAVE MUCH GREATER SAID. YEAH YEAH CENTER PAN THAT THAT'S PART OF REASON I ASKED MY FIRST THAT QUESTION IS IS THAT YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING AT THE YOUR CLASS FIND STATES DIFFER MODELS BUT. SOME OF IT HAS TO DO WITH WILL HOW DO YOU STRUCTURE THE WHOLE. THING IN THE STATE MUST RELATION BETWEEN THE STATE THE LOCALS FUNDING OTHER TYPES OF THINGS LEVERS OF FOR. PAUL AND I AND I THINK THE OTHER. ISSUE IS YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOU SAID WE DON'T HAVE MUCH DATA ON WHICH MY LIFE BUT ALSO THAT BAGS LIKE TO IS THE DATE EVEN OUT THERE IF WE HAD A RESEARCHER. IT WENT IT DO WE HAVE PERFORMANCE DATA ETCETERA. DO YOU HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW DOES THE PUBLIC IN THE EACH STATE WITH DIFFERENT MODELS WHICH WHICH ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY. ADD HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT. THE GOALS ARE FOR THE STATE EDUCATION AND. RECOGNIZING THAT ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION TAKING PLACE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT THERE'S SENSE LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE WHAT OUR MAIN PRIORITIES AND GOALS WHAT ARE. AND. AND IT AND NUMBER THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON THEM OR NOT RIGHT I MEAN I THINK. IF YOU ASK THE PERSON ON THE STREET ABOUT THAT. NOW DO THEY HAVE ANY IDEA. ARE NOT AND IS THERE IS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT MODELS IN TERMS OF THAT CLARITY WHO'S WHO'S ABLE TO TO BE THE SPOKESPERSON HIS ABLE TO BE. THE ATTITUDE TO SERVE BILL THE PUBLIC WILL. TWO TRY TO. TO TO MOVE AHEAD. EDUCATIONAL PRIORITIES. BUT THE PERSON YOU COME IN AND. PROCEDURE PRESENTATION ALSO APPRECIATE THE CONTINUE WORK OF WORLD ANY DOING TOGETHER. ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES RELATING TO EDUCATION POLICY MAKING AND AND SIR THANK YOU GUYS. FEEL THANK YOU BUSINESS A GOOD SEGUE FOR FOR OF AS. MR SCHNEIER AT JAMES DIRE WHOSE SIDE FOUNDER AND CEO OF COMMON SENSE ACTION FOR KIDS WHO HAS. A PROPOSED A RELATING TO. SOME SYSTEM CHANGES IN GOVERNANCE THAT HE'D. LIKE US TO CONSIDER WE WELCOME YOU TO. BUT HEARING HERE TODAY MISTER STARR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN. HOW HELLO EVERYBODY HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY? ACTUALLY I THINK BIG PICTURE WE THINK THAT. DONE WELL BY THIS SUB COMMITTEE THIS. JOINT COMMITTEE WHICH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU ALL COMING TOGETHER FOR. BY THIS COULD BE THIS KIND OF. CHANGE THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING COULD BE A BIG VALENTINE'S DAY PRESENT AND HERE I MULTI YEAR PRESENT TO THE KIDS OF CALIFORNIA SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME. JUST FOR TINY BIT BACK WHEN I AM ON THAT CD OF COMMON SENSE MEDIA. OUR OUR POLITICAL. ADVOCACY ARMS CALLED COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW. WE HAVE A CONSUMER PLATFORM WITH NEARLY A HUNDRED MILLION USERS AND CONSUMERS AND WE HAVE A SCHOOLS PLATFORM THAT SEND BACK TO THIRD TO THE SCHOOL THE UNITED STATES FOCUS PRIMARILY ON. DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP AND DIGITAL LITERACY WORK FOR CATS ON AS PART OF MY BACKGROUND TO I ALSO THE FOUNDER OF CHILDREN NOW IRAN CHILDREN NOW FOR THE FIRST NINE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE. I'M AND I'M A PROFESSOR IN THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. AT STANFORD WHERE. I HATE I HATE TO ADMIT I'VE BEEN THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS AND MY COLLEAGUES INCLUDE MIKE KIRST WHOM YOU ALL KNOW FROM THE STATE BOARD. LINDA DARLING HAMMOND OTHER FOLKS WHO HAD A BIG IMPACT ON EDUCATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BOMB THE BOTTOM LINE FOR US ON MASS BIG PICTURE IS THAT WE BELIEVE. THAT A THOUGHTFUL OF LOOK IN RESTRUCTURING OF THE GOVERNANCE OF THE OF OF EDUCATION K. THROUGH TWELVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WILL HAVE A LONG TERM POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF KIDS AND THE SCHOOLS IN THIS STATE. ARM AND. WE TAKE IT IS A ONE KEY ELEMENT OF A BIGGER PICTURE BUT AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ONE. AND THAT IF THIS COMMITTEE ACT CONTINUES TO LEAD BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE. AYE THAT THIS WILL HAVE REALLY SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM POSITIVE IMPACTS I'M KIDS IN SCHOOLS AND THAT I KNOW YOU ALL ON THIS COMMITTEE. BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT THAT SO. AYE WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS JOINTLY BOTH THROUGH THE CHAIRMAN PULLING THIS TOGETHER AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON IT IN LEADING UP TO THE PROPOSAL AND ON THE NET DESCRIBE BRIEFLY. WE MET WITH PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE STATE ARM AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL I'M AT THAT SCHOOLS A LEVEL BUT ALSO. TALKING TO A LOT OF THE BIG PLAYERS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE. FORMER UP THAT I STATE OFFICIALS ETCETERA. AND THERE WAS PRETTY MUCH UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT IN IN OUR IN OUR YEAR LONG EFFORT TO TAKE A LOOK AT PASS. THAT IT'S AWFUL RESTRUCTURING OF THE GOVERNANCE MODEL HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT ON. THE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION AND QUITE HONESTLY THE OUTCOMES FOR CATS. AND I HEARD THE QUESTION AND A VERY GOOD QUESTION ACTUALLY CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL ABOUT PROOF AND EVIDENCE ABOUT ABOUT IMPACT AND I THINK OUR PRIOR SPEAKERS WERE WE'RE CLEAR THAT. IT YOU HAVE TO EXTRAPOLATE IF YOU WILL FROM GOVERNMENTS TO ACTUAL STUDENT OUTCOMES AND I KNOW WE ALL CARE ABOUT STUDENT OUTCOMES AND A BETTER EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND I KNOW WE ALL KNOW THE STATS ON CALIFORNIA TO THAT YOU KNOW WERE IN THE FORTIES WHEN IT COMES TO A PER PUPIL SPENDING. AND ACTUALLY HOW WERE RANKED AS A STATE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY. I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED. AS ELEMENT O'DONNELL BUT BUT I DO THINK THAT ON A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL. ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY SIMPLICITY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DELIVERING SERVICES TICKETS THROUGH SCHOOLS AND IT IN THIS STATE. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT ABOUT FIVE POINTS YOU JUST MAKE FOR YOU OVERALL AND I AM NOT BUT I DO NOT AT THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE SAYS. AS I CAN COMBINE DOES FROM THE LA O. OR THE CHANCE FROM. FROM THE EDUCATION WHICH THE STATES BUT I THINK. THIRTY YEARS WORKING ON THIS LEADS ME DEBTS. I'M AND COMMENTS I THOUGHT FIVE BIG POINTS FIRST. THERE'S BEEN A LONG TERM STRUCTURAL CHALLENGE THAT I MISTER COUPON LAID OUT FOR YOU THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED CALIFORNIA FOR A HUNDRED YEARS IN THE STRUCTURE OF EDUCATION GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALL OF DEAD WHENEVER THEY HAVE A HOOVER COMMISSION OR A BIG STUDY AS YOU MENTIONED TN YEARS AGO. THERE'S A RECOMMENDATION TO CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE AND SIMPLIFY AT AND MAKE IT MORE TRANSPARENT AT TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABLE. SO AND THIS IS BEEN. BROUGHT UP BY GOVERNOR'S ATTORNEYS GENERAL THE LEGISLATURE ON THE COURTS AND ALL WHO SEEMS SORT OF A BALKANIZED STRUCTURE. AND WE'RE NOT COMING YEAR JASON WE HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE YOU ARE THE FOLKS WHO CAN COME UP WITH THE OVERALL LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR THAT. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM HAS BLURRED LINES OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND PLENTY OF OF ROOM FOR MUCH GREATER TRANSPARENCY EFFICIENCY AND HONESTLY WHERE CONSTITUENTS AND YOUR VOTERS AND THE PEOPLE THAT STATE KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE. AND SO. WE WE BELIEVE NUMBER ONE THAT THIS IS BEEN SEEN FOR YEARS AND AND NUMBER TWO THIS IS THE TIME. WE THINK THIS IS THE MOMENT THE EVEN TAKE TIME TO TRY TO FIX THIS. ARMED. AND WE THINK THAT YOU ALL AS THE LEGISLATURE IN IN A BY CAMEL WAY CAN DO JUST THAT COUPLE OF FOR OF THOUGHTS ON THAT. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE TIME AND THE FACT THAT BOTH THE GOVERNOR. AND. THIS HAS P. IRE ARE LEAVING OFFICE HAVE CAN HAVE AB IT PLEASE THROUGH THEIR STAFFS GIVEN US THEIR DIRECT TALKS ABOUT. HOW THE ALBUM GOING FORWARD THIS COULD BE DONE BUT ALSO THE IT'S? IF YOU I WOULD ARGUE AND AFTER THE CONVERSATION WITHOUT EVER LAST YEAR WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE SYSTEM. DAVID EIGHT IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN FOR ANOTHER TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AND IT MAY NEVER HAPPEN. AND THIS IS A UNIQUE MOMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THE LEAD. ON. AND BOTTOM LINE I THINK OUR POINT IS THAT IF YOU FOR SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE THAT THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. THEN SOME OF THE TOP DOWN ACCOUNTABILITY MANDATES LIKE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ME I I HEARD THE QUESTION THAT YOU RAISE. I'M MISTER KILEY ABOUT ABOUT TOP DOWN MICRO MANAGING THAT OR. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT EITHER AND ACTUALLY WE BELIEVE THAT. A A SMART GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WILL PROVIDE MUCH MORE BOTTOMS UP ACCOUNTABILITY AS OPPOSED POST WHEN COMBINED WITH LCF OFTEN SOME OF THE OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE PAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS. PALM. AND AND LITTLE ELIMINATES CERTAIN BYZANTINE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES THAT CAN GET ON THE WAY WORK REQUIRED THE STATE. AND AND AND LOCAL I. DISTRICT SUSPEND WAY TOO MUCH TIME AND RESOURCES ON. INEFFICIENT DIED BY COMPLICATED. STRUCTURES AND LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY UP BY THE WASTE CAN GENTLY I THINK AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE OTHER WITNESSES. THAT THIS ON ULTIMATELY ALSO BENEFIT EARLY CHILDHOOD AND. ALL OF YOU ALL ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT KIDS AN EDUCATION AND OBVIOUSLY. A GOOD EARLY CHILDHOOD SITUATION THE CONCERN OF FIVE IS GONNA LATE LEAD INTO THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM WELL IN SCHOOL TILL AND WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S CHANGE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. WILL IN FACT ALSO IN YOUR TO THE BENEFIT OF BY STREAMLINED MORE EFFICIENT EARLY CHILDHOOD SYSTEM IN THE STATE. I'M ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT PART OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSAL WAS PRETTY FUNNY TODAY. AND LASTLY EVEN THOUGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE ROLE OF THE S. P. AYE WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL'S STRIKES ME AS P. AYE. AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING OUT OF THAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM OTHERS ON. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY A MORE ACCOUNTABLE EFFICIENT SIMPLE SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE WHERE IT'S CLEAR WHO'S IN CHARGE IN IT'S CLEAR WHO THE PEOPLE CAN HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. IS GONNA BE A BETTER SYSTEM OF EDUCATION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE BIG WINNERS ARE GOING TO BE KEPT. WHEN YOU HEARD FROM THE EDUCATION COMMISSION OF THE STATES YOU CAN SEE THE FOUR MODELS AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT AS MUCH EXPERTS AS THEY ARE ON THIS. BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATES THAT ARE DOING THE BEST IN TERMS OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT OUTCOMES. THEY INCLUDE NASA WE I WAS WE HAD WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE CHAIRMAN ABOUT BRINGING THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS HERE WHO OVERSAW THE RESTRUCTURING THERE. I MEAN BE HAPPY TO MAKE FOLKS LIKE HIM AND OTHERS AVAILABLE TO YOU. A TERMS OF LOOKING OUR THEIR STATE OF DONE IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE EDUCATION COMMISSION THE STATE FOLKS UPSET. BUT OUR OVERALL SENSE IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP PERFORMING STATES IN TERMS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND DELIVERING RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY TO STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS DIRECTLY. THEY ALMOST ALL FALL INTEREST MORE SIMPLIFIED ACCOUNTABLE STRUCTURE STATES LIKE KENTUCKY. MASSACHUSETTS CONNECTICUT MADE MAJOR STRIDES IN THIS AREA. ON. AND SO WITH ALL OF THAT IN MIND WITH THE INPUT WE GOT FROM PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE. ARE WE BASICALLY HAVE A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL. WHICH IS I. DOT YOU WHAT WOULD THAT WE WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY UP PUT THE ARMED. LEAVE THE CONTROL OF THAT. LET ME BLOOM FERRETS WE WOULD OF MADE MORE SPECIFICALLY. WE WOULD AMEND THAT CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE TO GENERALLY IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BIPARTISAN TWO THOUSAND TO MASTER PLAN EDUCATION. TO MOVE THE AUTHORITY FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE ACT CALIFORNIA CURRENT PRE K. THROUGH TWELVE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AT LARGE AND THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DELIVERY OF EDUCATION. I TO STUDENTS WITHIN THE ON OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR UNDER THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. IT WOULD EMPOWER THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT TO PLAY AN ESSENTIAL LINCHPIN ROLE. AS THE OBJECT COORDINATOR BETWEEN ALL COR P. THROUGH SIXTEEN GOVERNING BODIES TO BRING GREATER COHERENCE IN POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY YOU'RE PUTTING THIS THE POWER UNDER THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR ARM AND AS I SAID WE THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. ON AND IT WILL ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN OUR ATTACK THE ROLE OF THE FBI JOBS FOR A PERFECT SOME EXAMPLES ON. THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT WOULD REMAIN INDEPENDENT AND ELECT THAT LECTURED STATEWIDE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER. SERVING AS A AN INDEPENDENT STRONG VOICE FOR PEOPLE ON EDUCATION MATTERS WOULD GAIN A VOTING ROLE ON THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. FREED FROM THINK THEY'VE CUMBERSOME ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES I'M IN THAT ROLE THE SUPER SPI. WOULD FILL WE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT AND INFLUENTIAL ROLE BY WORKING. I'M ALIGNING EFFORTS ACROSS EARLY CHILDHOOD K. THROUGH TWELVE AND HIGHER ED BY SERVING THE THE BOARD OF VOTE ON THE BOARDS OF. POP OF THE KEY. OUT OF THE QUEUE. INSTITUTIONS THAT MATTER IN THE STATE EDUCATION INCLUDING THE UC REGENTS THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES GOVERNING BOARD MCALISTER'S BOARD AND CTC. AND THAT'S S. B. I WOULD HAVE A MUCH IN OUR VIEW HAVE A MUCH STRONGER ROLE IN SERVING ACTIVELY IN THOSE CAPACITIES. THE PROPOSAL WOULD THAT WERE WERE SUGGESTING AND AGAIN WE KNOW YOU WILL LOOK AT IT AND COME UP WITH WHAT YOU THINK OF THEM THE BEST THE BEST SOLUTION. ON OUR PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE THAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE BOARD. WHO'S CURRENTLY APPOINTED BY THE GOD APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. WOULD WOULD. WOULD. I WOULD HAVE. DIED DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY AUTHORITY OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE ACTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES. THAT POSITION WOULD BE SUBJECT TO SENATE CONFIRMATION. IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE WOULD GAIN THE ABILITY TO APPOINT AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION SO IT'S A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE. STATE BOARD THAN CURRENTLY EXISTS IN GIVES THE LEGISLATURE INPUT INTO THAT THAT THE STATE BOARD WHO THEN OBVIOUSLY SELECTS DOT DOT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. TOM WE BIG DEBTS WILL SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE THE SYSTEM BUT ALSO CREATE. ACCOUNTABILITY ON. AND IT WILL CUT DOWN ON THE LEVEL OF STATE BUREAUCRACY AND WHICH WE FEEL IT'S CONSISTENT WITH GOVERNOR'S BROWN'S. RELEASED EARLY IN HIS FOR IN ITS FIRST TERM AT. ELIMINATION OF THE SECRETARY'S EDUCATION OFFICE AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS TERM AND JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW OLD I AM I WAS HERE WHEN MAUREEN DIMARCO WAS APPOINTED. AS THE FIRST SECRETARY VEGETATION AND I BELIEVE TESTIFIED ON THAT SO WE HAVE SEEN THAT PLATE MANY OF YOU WERE HEARING GRADE SCHOOL IN THOSE DAYS BUT. WE THIS HAS BEEN A SYSTEM OF TEASING BUT WE WITH THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING IN IN A WAY AND I THINK GOVERNOR BROWN'S DECISION TO ELIMINATE THAT POSITION WAS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND THIS RESTRUCTURING WOULD HELP I MENTIONED BRIEFLY I THINK ALSO THAT IF THIS I DONE EARLY CHILDHOOD WILL BE A MORE STREAMLINED INEFFECTIVE SYSTEM THAN IT CURRENTLY IS. SENATOR PAN AND OTHERS OF YOU KNOW WEALTHY EARLY CHILDHOOD SYSTEM HERE IN ALL THE KEEP USING COMPLEXITIES THAT ACCEPTS THEIR. URINE GABLE AND OTHERS ARE GONNA TESTIFY LATER BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT IN THE LONG RUN IT'S GOVERNMENT'S RESTRUCTURING WILL ALSO REALLY HELP ON THE EARLY CHILDHOOD FRONT. ON AND THE BOTTOM LINE FOR AYE SAYS. IF WE DO THAT S.. CLARITY SIMPLICITY EFFICIENCY TRANSPARENCY. ALL OF THOSE ARE GOING TO BE GOOD FOR EDUCATION ALL OF THOSE ARE GOING TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC EVEN MORE. IN A SYSTEM WHERE THEY KNOW THE ULTIMATE ACCOUNTABILITY TO YOUR POINT OF ONE I CAN IMPOSE SENATOR PANTS BUT WHAT IF YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR DOESN'T CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT EDUCATION. WELL FIRST OF ALL AYE IT'S GONNA BE IT'S A SUCH A HUGE PORTION OF OUR BUDGET THAT A GOVERNOR HERE SHE CANNOT CARE ABOUT THAT. AND NUMBER TWO AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS WHAT I THINK MOST OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS CARE ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE OPERATION OF THE OF THE OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT. THEY CARE A LOT ABOUT HOW THE STATE AND THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES DELIVER EDUCATION AND EDUCATE THEIR KIDS IN THEIR SCHOOLS. PHILIP THE END OF THE DAY WE THANK IS STREAMLINED OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WILL MAKE A BIG WIN FOR FOR KIDS. THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. LETTING ME GET UP FOR ANYONE PRESENTED. QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL. IT'S A MEMBER OF KILEY. BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FEAR AT TESTIMONY MR STIERHEIM SO I I WOULDN'T DISCUSS START BY ASKING ABOUT PAN. YOU'RE. I THEORY THAT THIS WILL MAKE THINGS MORE EFFICIENT AND SO IS THIS AYE ARE YOU GENERALLY AN ADVOCATE FOR AYE AYE A UNITARY EXECUTIVE. I YOU KNOW SHOULD WE BRING FUNCTIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SECRETARY OF STATE. UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR IS THERE SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT. EDUCATIONAL YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO BE AS INDEPENDENT AIRCRAFT ARE CAUSING AYE TATE'S REALLY JUST ABOUT EDUCATION OKAY. UP BY ACCU AT STANFORD WHEN I TEACHES CUTS CON LAW SO I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND TO YOU TERRY EXECUTIVE. AND I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN HAVING. A INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY TO AJ IT'S REALLY AN EDUCATION IT'S REALLY THE CONFUSING SITUATION WE RIGHT NOW. WHERE IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR TO PEOPLE OF WHO'S IN CHARGE ON A SPECIFIC BOTH IN TERMS OF THE THE ULTIMATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION SO KNOW WHAT SPECIFICALLY STRUCTURED AROUND? THE DELIVERY OF K. THROUGH TWELVE SERVICES BUT ALSO EARLY CHILDHOOD I THINK IN THE LONG RUN BUT IT'S NOT. THE IDEA OF A UNITARY A GOVERNMENT WITH EVERYTHING UNDER THE POWER PERSON GOT IT SO YOU SEEM TO WANT TO BRING MOST THE POWERS THE SPI UNDER THE GOVERNOR BUT I GUESS YOU COULD JUST AS EASILY TO CLEAR UP THAT. CONFUSION WITH THE OTHER WAY AROUND AND BRING SOME OF THE AUTHORITIES OF THE BOARD UNDER THE S. B. IRAN I THINK I I GET YOUR POINT I'M NOT I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK. THEY'D BE I DON'T THINK WE WE THINK THAT THE FBI IS LOSING IN THIS EQUATION WE BELIEVE THAT THE FBI IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE EMPOWERED IN THIS PROPOSAL. AND THAT THE FBI IS GONNA LOOK IS GONNA LOSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE ESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT'S GOING TO GO UNDER. THE. STATE BOARD BUT WE ARE TO BELIEVE THIS WILL STRENGTHEN THE ROLE OF THE VOICE OF AND ACTUALLY THE IMPACT OF THE S. P. AYE. REMOVING THEM FROM SORT OF A BUREAUCRATIC ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN PUTTING THAT IN ONE PLACE WITH ONE WITH ONE. ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH IS UNDER THE STATE BOARD. WHICH AGAIN ULTIMATELY REPORTS INTO THE GOVERNOR BUT I DON'T THINK WE SEE THIS IS AS. I. ANYWAY UNDER I THINK WE SEE THIS IS IT IS GROWING THAT AUTHORITY IF YOU WILL OF THE FBI AND A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE. CIRCULATING THIS ROUND AND TALKING TO DIFFERENT EXPERTS. INCLUDING WITH AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE FBI TOUR LOOKS AND AND HIS STAFF. WITH A SENSE FROM DAM ACTUALLY THAT THAT WOULD BE POSITIVE. SO IT WITH WHICH IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO GOT THAT ROLE IT'S THAT DELIVER EFFICIENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. OKAY THAT'S INTERESTING GIVEN HAVING THE FBI ALL THESE BOARDS IS GONNA GIVE HERE SHIA. BIGGER VOICE LET'S PUT THAT CLEARLY WE DO YET FOR THAT KLIM ASIDE FOR A% MORE ENGAGE LET'S PUT THAT KIND TO THE SIDE FOR A SECOND AND THAT. YOU YOU DO SAY THAT YOU WANT BUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE S. P. AYE UNDER. THE PURVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR BUT WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT THOSE ARE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS YOU'RE NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR THE UNITARIANS THAT COULD HAVE SOME BY DO YOU. FAVOR. A UNITARY EXECUTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO ADMINISTRATIVE EDUCATION FUNCTIONS WHEN ANOTHER AREAS BECAUSE WE BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS THE ONE THAT SO ITSELF HAVE BEEN SUCH I HAVE BEEN URGED FOR A HUNDRED YEARS TO BE RESTRUCTURED RIGHT WHAT ABOUT THE SUGGESTION I JUST MADE THAT YOU COULD FLIP. IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND SO THE ADMINISTRATIVE. EXIST IN THE STATE PARK I GOT A. COULD ARE YOU COULD OUR SENSE IS IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO DO IT UNDER THE SLIDE. MY GOVERNOR BUT BECAUSE WE TAKE THAT ULTIMATELY THE GOVERNOR IS THE PERSON WHEN YOU THINK OF YOUR AVERAGE CONSTITUENT WHO THE PERSON WHO THE PUBLIC'S GOING TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE THINK THAT THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A MUCH STRONGER POSITION ELECTORALLY QUITE FRANKLY GOVERNOR'S A BIGGER DEAL THAN S. B. I. AND WE THINK IT MAKES A LOGICAL SENSE TO HAVE THE OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY IN ONE PLACE RATHER THAN ACROSS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT LOCUSTS AS. YOUR POINT'S WELL TAKEN THAT YOU COULD SAY LET'S PUT IT ALL OVER HERE. BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE I THINK IT WOULD CONTINUE THE CONFUSION ACT THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THAT SORT OF. IT WITH WITH DUAL AND UNCLEAR LINES OF AUTHORITY BETWEEN SP AYE AND THE STATE BOARD WITH THE STATE BOARD OF THE FEEDING ON OF THE GOVERNOR. AN ARTS CENTER IS THIS IS THE SIMPLEST MOST LOGICAL WAY TO DO IT BUT THE TRUTH IS COMING CALLING. THAT'S THE COMP THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE WANT YOU TO HAVE AND YOU HAVE RECKONED LANDED ON THE REALLY SMART PEOPLE HERE WORK ON EDUCATION WAY LONGER THAN I HAVE. AND SO WE'RE RISK AT THE END OF THE DAY A CLEARER MORE SIMPLE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS GOING TO BENEFIT GETS PERIOD. BUT IT TO YOUR POINT'S WELL TAKEN YOU COULD DO IT DEATH THANK YOU AND I I I WILL JUST KNOW THAT SORT OF THE ARGUMENT THAT WHILE THE GOVERNOR'S MORE VISIBLE FIGURE THAT. IS EQUALLY AN ARGUMENT FOR PUTTING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THIS AREA STATE AND SO FORTH THOSE FUNCTIONS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S WHILE I I WOULDN'T I I DOUBT I WOULD SAY THAT I DOUBT I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU BUT I GET YOUR POINT BUT I YEAH SO I HAVE BEEN. LOOKING AT THE LOCAL. OF THINGS I WE HAVE ELECTED AND I THINK MOST COUNTY USER AT LEAST SEVERAL COUNTIES IN ELECTED COUNTY. AS SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION AND WE ALSO HAVE ELECTED I COUNTY BOARDS OF EDUCATION DOES THAT LEAD TO THE SAME SORT OF PROBLEMS AT THE LOCAL EVEL YOU KNOW IT'S. A GOOD QUESTION AND I'M NOT HERE DAY TO COME. IT'S A VERY GOOD. TO ASK I'M AND I THINK THAT MIGHT MY GENERAL SENSE ON THIS IS THAT THE L. CFF DECISION TAKEN EARLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S FIRST TERM. REALLY DEVOLVED A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITYTO THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR FUNDING IN AND OTHER. OTHER LOCAL SCHOOLS DECISIONS WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS A MEAN ULTIMATELY I THINK OUR SENSE IS THAT I'LL SEE IF OPPOSITE GOOD DECISION THAT REALLY THAT THERE WAS A POSITIVE SUPPORT FOR THE STATE PARTICULARLY FOR. AND IT FOR LOWER INCOME KIDS QUITE HONESTLY AND FOR DISTRICTS THAT NEED THE MOST HELP UPON BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S THIS IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT'S RIGHT IT IS A LONGER DISCUSSION IT'S NOT RIGHT. THERE AND BY THE WAY I WOULD SAY THIS TO. WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THIS IS THE MAGIC BULLET WE'RE NOT SAYING THERE IS ONE THING IN OF ALL ALL YOU HAVE TO DO HERE IS RESTRUCTURE THE SYSTEM AND. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE PERFECT IN CALIFORNIA'S GOING GO FROM FORTY TWO TO ONE IN TWO YEARS. THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLET THE WE THINK THIS IS A LOGICAL INTELLIGENT WAY TO MORE EFFICIENTLY DELIVER SERVICES TO KIDS IN SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. AND TO HAVE A CLEAR LINE A CLEAR LINE OF A THOUGHT OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OVERALL WHICH IS WHY. YOU GUYS ARE ALL ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND PLOTS ABOUT MY LIFE WORKING ON KIDS AN EDUCATION. RIGHT BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY ARE YOU FOCUSING ON THIS REFORM AT THE STATE LEVEL WHERE THE SAME BIFURCATION OF AUTHORITY SEEMS TO EXIST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE WE BECAUSE AFTER TALKING AFTER HAVING WORKED ON THESE ISSUES FOR TWENTY PLUS YEARS. AND TALKING TO PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE STATE AT ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS THEY KEPT COMING BACK TO THE THEME THAT PICTURE THAT WE SHOULD RESTRUCTURE THAT AND THAT EVERY COMMISSION THAT EVER LOOKED AT THAT SAYS RESTRUCTURE THAT. BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'S AND SO AGAIN IT IS NOT A PURELY SIGNED I THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT OF SOME WOMEN O'DONNELL QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW SHOW THEIR. PURE EVIDENCE AGREED THE GOOD PHD THESIS PER SOME KID IT AT HIM AND IN A PHD UPS AT SCHOOL RIGHT NOW. BUT IT'S JUST IT IT JUST ON ITS FACE AND AND ALSO WITH WITH THE INPUT OF SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE ON THE STATE. IT IS A LOGIC A MORE LOGICAL STREAMLINED EFFICIENT TRANSPARENT SYSTEM. BUT IT'S NOT A MAGIC BULLET LEFT I WILL BE CLEAR ON THAT THEY'RE STILL LOT OF OTHER STUFF THAT YOU ALL. ON THIS IMPORTANT COMMITTEE AFTER WORK ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD EDUCATION SO SO WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THIS TO BE A MORE LOGICAL AND TRANSPARENT AND EFFICIENT SYSTEM EVERY NIGHT YOU THROW OUT A FEW EXAMPLES OF STATES THAT HAPPENED OF GOOD RESULTS THAT ALSO. HAPPEN OF THE SYSTEM THAT YOU LIKE BUT THAT AYE GENTLEMAN TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU GO I THINK YOU'LL KNOWLEDGE IS MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE TOPIC AND YOU. I STATED THAT THERE IS NO QUANTIFIABLE EVIDENCE ACTUALLY THE ONE SYSTEM WORKS BETTER HAN THE OTHER GOES BELOW ME FINISH MY QUESTION. AS TO WHY ARE WE SORT OF. THROWING AROUND IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN TWEAK THIS BETWEEN BAT WITHOUT HAVING FIRST RIGOROUSLY STUDIED I YOU KNOW HUNDRED PLUS YEARS OF HISTORY WITH. THESE DIFFER MODELS I THINK WE ARE I MEAN I MY MY ANSWER TO IS I THINK YOU HAVE I THINK THAT THEY ARE NOT GEARED TO TO THAT QUESTION AND. AND AND THE TRUTH IS THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT BEEN A MOUNTAIN OF RESEARCH MONEY PUT INTO STUFF LIKE THAT TOO AND A DETAILED. QUANTIFIABLE DISCUSSION ABOUT BUT I THINK IN THE BIG PICTURE SENSE I BET THAT IF YOU GO TAKE THAT GO GHOST SPEND AND AND I KNOW YOU AND YOUR ALL YOUR CABLE DO THAT FROM TIME TO. GO ASK ALL THE PEOPLE IN EDUCATION THE STATE TO WORK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE STATE LEVEL ABOUT THIS AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET DIFFERENCE OPINION FROM THE PEOPLE ARE GONNA TESTIFY AFTER MIDNIGHT A LIGHT RIGHT. SO WE'RE NOT SICK AND PART OF WHAT WE'VE WHAT I THINK IS REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS DISCUSSION IS YOU ARE BOTH. BOTH HOUSES THE LEGISLATURE HERE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT. AND. ALL OF THE INPUT WE HAVE GOTTEN HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WHILE THIS IS A WONKY SOLUTION IT ACTUALLY WILL ULTIMATELY. IN YOUR TO SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR SCHOOLS HERE AND KICK DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO GET AND ALSO SENT TO THE PUBLIC THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY YEAH BUT IS VERY ONE STUDY THAT. THAT COULD CANONIZE THAT NO AND THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION BUT THE BALANCE OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS SO AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT WHAT CAN. COUPON SAID WHICH IS EVERY STUDY THAT'S LOOKED TO PASS FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS HAS RECOMMENDED A CHANGE OF THIS NATURE WITHOUT ALL THE SPECIFIC ELEMENTS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE RELYING ON AND IT'S NOT PURE SCIENCE I WOULD AGREE. RIGHT WE I MEAN YOU I KNOW SOMEONE WHO CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT STUDENT TIME HOW COMES AND THAT. AND IMPROVING THAT AND I YOU SEEM TO BE ACKNOWLEDGING I GUESS THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT WHAT'S WRITTEN OTHER STATES IN AS QUANTIFIABLE WAYS WE COULD AND. AGAIN THAT THE JOHN JUST TESTIFIED. AGREED WITH THAT SO WOULD YOU. AGREE THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY NOT MAKE ANY SORT OF STRUCTURAL CHANGE UNTIL WE HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF EVIDENCE WHERE THAT THE FOLKS WHO JUST TESTIFIED COULD TELL US THAT WE ACTUALLY DO NOW HAVE SOME GOOD EVIDENCE. THIS MOTTO TO NOW IT WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T OF I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION NO I THINK THAT. I THINK THAT THE BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT EXISTS. IS IS GOOD ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT A CHANGE NOW WILL WILL MAKE THAT HAVE YOUR MONEY WHAT THAT EVIDENCE WAS DONE I I THINK IT'S THAT IT'S IT'S REALLY THE EVIDENCE AS. OF OF OF TO GAWKING TO ALL THE OTHER KEY EDUCATION PLAYERS AROUND THE CITY TALKING TO PEOPLE ISN'T REALLY EVIDENCE YOU HAVE KEY POINT WHAT THE EVIDENCES. YOU KNOW I WOULD AGAIN BE IT ONLY EVIDENCE I WOULD POINT TO WOULD BE THE STATES THAT ARE EXCEEDING US IN TERMS OF THEIR RANKINGS INTERFERE IN DELIVERING EDUCATIONAL SERVICES TO PUPILS. ARE WHO HAVE A MORE STREAMLINED EFFICIENT SYSTEMS COSTS OF THEIR STATES THAT ARE EXCEEDING US THE HOMEGROWN KNOWN LET MISTER STARR FINISH FOR THAT'S MY ALMA THINKING THAT RESCUED ME WAIT NO LET HIM FINISH HIS COMMENT BEFORE YOU COME BACK IT UP PLEASE. ABOUT MY LETTUCE BE POLITE IN THIS ROOM THANKS A LOT. BUT TAKES A FROM IMMINENT ON THAT FOR IT TO BE THERE FOR QUITE I GET I GET YOUR POINT I MEAN I I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU BUT SUBMITS THAT SOME OF THE PROMISES YOUR QUESTION BUT. THE BUT THE FAIR POINT AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT THERE IS NOIT THERE'S NO PERFECT ROADMAP THAT'S BEEN LAID OUT AND I WOULDN'T TAKE FIVE YEARS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND DO THAT. THIS IS A PRETTY LOGICAL CLEAR THING TO DO YOU SHOULD DISCUSS IT IS A COMMITTEE COME FROM ABOUT IT COME OUT IT WITH YOUR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. AND. WE STRONGLY THINK THAT THIS A PROPOSAL WILL DELIVER MUCH BETTER RESULTS FOR KIDS IN SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA NOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE MAKE COME. CURRENTLY IT DIDN'T HURT I JUST WANNA THANK YOU MISTER TECH IS I THINK YOU'RE OPEN GOAL HERE IS REALLY STUDENT OUTCOMES. IT NOW COMES OUT AND IT'S BETTER SCHOOLS ABSOLUTELY IT ISN'T JUST CHANGING GOVERNANCE TO CHANGE GOVERNANCE. BUT I AND THAT BY THE WAY I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE THAT'S AND THAT'S WHY I'VE USED THE TERM WONKY ACTUALLY MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE. IT IS LONG ITS GOVERNANCE YOU COULDN'T GO IT'S IT'S COMPLICATED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU ALL WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. BUT THE TRUTH IS AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S TO DELIVER ME MORE AND BETTER SERVICES TO KIDS AND TEACHERS IN YOUR TEACHER OF TWENTY TWO YEARS I'M A TEACHER. THAT'S HOW I GOT INTO THIS FIELD WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ISN'T VERY FEW THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN DOING A GOOD JOB OF RAISING AND EDUCATING OUR KIDS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS. GOVERNANCE CHANGE WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT BUT NOT AND SIMPLE BUT I IN OF ITSELF THE ONLY ELEMENT. PHILIP GIVE US A BETTER EDUCATION SYSTEM BETTER RESOURCES FOR TEACHERS BETTER OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS ALL THE THINGS WE ALL CARE ABOUT YOU. THANK YOU. THANKS. WE'RE I PAID AMERICA SAY I DON I FIND A LOT OF THE PROPOSAL VERY INTRIGUING AND THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME THINGS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE THAT ARE. THAT ARE PART PROBLEMATIC IN AND PERHAPS. DYSFUNCTIONAL. I'M PART OF WHAT MAKES ALL THIS SO DIFFICULT IS THAT. SO MUCH OF THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS OR DOESN'T WORK AND ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO WHO'S IN THE POSITIONS YEAH. AND I'M. I'M I'M NOT SURE WHETHER MAKING THIS CHANGE WILL YOU KNOW WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. I'M. IF THINGS I AM. I MEAN I'M I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE SOME OF THE LINE OF QUESTIONING COMING FROM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ABOUT. DATA. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T. THIS OTHERS NOT A PART OF MY GOD THAT CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU THAT THE YOU REALLY ON THE SOMETHING ASSISTED IF WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MAKE A ENORMOUS CHANGE TOWARD A STINT WITH ALL OF THE. CHALLENGE IN MONEY IN BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARE AND. REGULATORY ALTERATIONS NECESSARY ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING TEAMS LIKE THIS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE REALLY MAKE SURE THAT. IT'S NOT JUST. BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH PRICE MORE PEOPLE I MEAN I I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T DISCOUNT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVEN'T HAD. CONVERSATIONS WITH REALLY WISE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW OUT ABOUT THIS AND HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME. I THINK THAT'S PARTLY I THINK I THINK THAT'S GONNA WITH DECENT NUMBERS GETTING AND I AGREE. I AYE THAT THOSE RIVER CRESCENT BY THE AD THAT THEY WERE TOTALLY VERY QUESTIONS. AND AND AND IN SOME CASES YOU SAW I COULDN'T GIVE YOU A A YOU AND EVIDENTIAL PURE EVIDENTIARY BASIS BUT I D THINK THAT THOUGHT THAT. I DO THINK THAT EVERYTIME THIS IS BEEN LOOKED AT BY REALLY SERIOUS COMMISSIONS AND AND I'M REALLY RESPECTED BY THE. STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO CARE ABOUT THAT PAVE ALL COME BACK WITH THE SAME CONCLUSION AND THEY ALL REFERRED MISTER CHAIRMAN TO THE DYSFUNCTION YOU MENTIONED. THAT THAT DEPICT A BLURRED LINES OF AUTHORITY THE BLURRED LINES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND HONESTLY YOU HAVE TO EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE COOKS CAN SPRINTS FOR CONSULTANTS FOR THIS COMMITTEE ON PO IN BOTH. IN BOTH HOUSES I'M WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH BASS TO AND SO I I WISH I COULD PRESENT YOU WITH SORT OF THE MASTER PLAN STUDY THAT HAVE BEEN DONE I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE DONE. ON AND I AGREE I THINK IT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION TO ASK MISTER CHAIRMAN AS YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE ENOUGH TO GO ON. TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL CHANGE LIKE AS. OUR STRONG FEELING IS YES BUT THAT'S. THAT THAT'S WHY WE ELECTED SUCH FINE REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE DECISIONS LIKE THAT. OKAY SO LET ME JUST COUPLE APPRECIATE THAT I'VE BEEN APPRECIATE THEM YOU KNOW. THE THE OPEN WAY THAT YOU'RE DOWN HERE JUST ASKING US TO CONSIDER THIS AYE MEN THINK THAT SOME. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S REALLY WHERE THE DISCUSSIONS Y. WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION TODAY I GUESS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS ARMED. ALONG THE LINES OF OF WHAT CENTER KILEY WAS ASKING ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STATE. AND THE AND THE LOCALS WONDER THIS STRUCTURE OUT HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT WE DON'T INCREASE CONFUSION. I. WHEN YOU'VE GOT. YOU KNOW DISTRICT IN COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS HAVING TO ANSWER POTENTIALLY BOTH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT AND SECTOR OF EDUCATION IN CERTAIN THINGS. NOW THEY'RE GONNA BE SEPARATE ENTITIES UNDER YOUR PROPOSAL BUT THEY WERE PUT IN THIS WAY CITIES ARE OUT THERE IN THIS ONE THEY WOULD JUST BE THAT DAY WOULD NO LONGER. HAVE THE SAME LINES OF AUTHORITY TOWARD THAT TO THE S. P. AYE IT WOULD REALLY BE GOING THROUGH THE STATE THAT YOU HAVE ONE. WE HAVE ONE CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY FOR OVERALL COMPETENCE OKAY IN GENERAL. OKAY I'M. ONE OTHER QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH WITH AT WITH YOUR CONSIDERATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND ALL OF THIS AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE BEING SMART ABOUT ARTICULATION BETWEEN. KITTY TWELVE AND HIGHER ED AND AND TEN. YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO HOW TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S SMART ARTICULATION HAVE YOU SPENT TIME LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL HONESTLY NOT NOT THAT MUCH AND BY THE WAY IN IN IN ALL SORT OF INTO TELLING ABOUT YOU ALL BECAUSE AGAIN WE WE DO THIS WITH RESPECT FOR. THE COMMITTEE AND WHO'S ON IT YOU KNOW. MY COLLEAGUE AT STANFORD PROFESSOR CURSE IS ALSO THE PRESIDENT STATE BOARD SOME IF MY CAR YOU COULD YOU CALL KNOW HIM WELL ARE YOU ARE YOU SURE YOU SHOULD. THIS IS THE I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THIS AND CONSIDER THIS KIND OF CHANGE IT WOULD BE SO IT WOULD BE FOLKS LIKE MY CURSE TO SPEND YEAR THROUGH MANAGING THIS. IN DIFFERENT ROLES I'M AND AND AND SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE BOARD AND AS I'VE AYE AYE I. MENTIONED BOTH. LYNN AND WRECKED BECAUSE OF THEIR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE AS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO REALLY REALLY KNOW THE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE STATE LEVEL A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. AND LOCAL SUPERINTENDENTS ETCETERA AND. OUR OUR OUR REQUEST YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HONOR TO HAVE A HEARING ON THIS IN A REALLY SERIOUS DISCUSSION IS. WHAT'S COME UP WITH A BETTER SYSTEM BUT LET'S DRAW ON THE EXPERTISE OF PEOPLE WHO MANAGE THE SYSTEM OVER THE PAST. I'D DECADE OR TWO AND AND AND AND COME UP WITH A MORE EFFICIENT STREAMLINED TRANSPARENT. PROPOSAL YEAH WE DID SAY WE HAD ALL BUT AT ALL THE ANSWERS OURSELVES. WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU SEE AS WHERE YOU SEE THIS IS A BIG PICTURE QUESTION AS THE GREATEST DYSFUNCTION ASSOCIATE WITH OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE? WHAT WHAT'S WITH THE BIGGEST PROBLEM TRYING TO SOLVE HERE? I WOULD SAY THAT THREE WERE AYE JAY ACCOUNTABLE I THINK I KEEP USING THE WORD ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S NOT CLEAR TO THE AVERAGE PERSON MAYBE TO EXPERTS ON IT WHERE THE ACCOUNTABILITY LIES WHICH WE THINK IT'S REALLY HELPFUL. I THINK. AND AND BY THE WAY THAT MATTERS IN TERMS OF CONSTITUENTS BELIEVING THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO. HELP THEIR KIDS GET A BETTER EDUCATION IN THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL BE BETTER AND WHICH OF THE WAY THAT THE NINETY PERCENT OF THE FOLKS WHO ELECT YOU THINK. THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW REMOTE TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WORKS BETTER IMAGES MORE EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF RESOURCE. SO I WOULD TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT. AND IT'S AND IT'S STILL ITS THE EXPECT THE ALSO THAT TO EDIT SYSTEM WHERE THEY ALL POINT FINGERS AT THE. RIGHT NOW WHERE I KNOW THAT'S NT OUR FAULT THAT'S THEIR FAULT THAT THEIR RESPONSE GOING. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A CHANGE IN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WE BELIEVE THAT A CHANGE IN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. WOULD REMOVE THAT AND CLARIFIES ABOUT THE INCLUDING BY THE WAY. IF IT'S NOT THAT GOOD AND THE OUTCOMES AREN'T THAT GOOD HOLDING THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE MORE WHO ARE IN CHARGE. IT IN A MORE CLEAR HEADED WAY AND AND INCLUDE INCLUDING WHY ARE WE GETTING BETTER RESULTS IN BEING ABLE TO TARGET BACK. TO PICK TO QUITE FRANKLY TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE BOARD IN A MORE STRATEGIC WAY. THAT MEANS IT'S INTERESTING. AND I PAY. I THINK I STRUGGLED WITH SOME OF THE VERY THE SPACE IN QUESTIONS WHEN I SERVED AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER IN MY HOMETOWN. I OUT YOU KNOW. AND IT REALLY DOES. HELP TO ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE TENSIONS THAT UNDER GIRD. SOME OF THE CENTER COUNTIES QUESTIONS. WE DECIDED. NOT ONLY A THIN AT THE STATE LEVEL TO SEPARATE OUT EDUCATION GOVERNMENTS FROM THE. YEAH FROM THE GOVERNORS PAROLE BUT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO WE DECIDED TO. GIVE ALL THE LOCAL POWER CITY COUNCILS BUT CREATE SEPARATE SCHOOL WORDS BECAUSE EDUCATION SO SPECIAL SO DIFFERENT SO. SO IMPORTANT SO UNIQUE. THAT WE WANTED OUT ENTIRELY SEPARATE BOARD TO BE A GRAPPLING WITH THOSE EDUCATION POSSIBILITY QUESTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THAT'S BEEN A. AYE TWO HEADED DRAGON I'M ON THE ONE HAND IT HAS PROVIDED MORE ATTENTION AND MORE FOCUS ON EDUCATION A GROUP OF ELECTED OFFICIALS AND A WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE TO. JUST FOCUS ON EDUCATION THE FLIPSIDE IS SOMETIMES SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND THE POWER STRUCTURE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN. AYE AS IN THE MIX WITH THE WAY THE LOCAL GOVERNANCE IS TAKING PLACE PLAYING THERE'S A FEAR PERHAPS WITH THIS. YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A THERE'S A PROMINENT SO THE GOVERNOR'S POSITION THERE'S A THERE'S A POLITICAL POWER TO THE GOVERNOR'S POSITION THE SAME TIME THE GOVERNOR'S WORKING ON TWENTY NINE DIFFERENT ISSUES. AND IF THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T YOU KNOW AND WE HEARD THIS EARLIER IF THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE LEADERSHIP IT DOESN'T SEEM TO PRIORITIZE EDUCATION DOESN'T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT EDUCATION. I THINK THERE'D BE A FEAR UNDER YOUR PROPOSAL EDUCATION COULD ACTUALLY BE. EVEN LOWER AYE DOWN THE TOTEM POLE DAN I'M THAT IT IS NOW I AT LEAST WITH S. P. AYE YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE WHO IS. WHOSE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO FOCUS ON EDUCATION THE FOOT SAID OF COURSE ISN'T IT'S A LESS PRONE POSITION MAYBE IT'S TOO EASY FOR GOVERNOR TO SELL THAT THE S. B. I.'S RESPOSIBILITY AT STATE BOARDS MONTHS BILL I'M GONNA FOCUS ON. YEAH CLIMATE CHANGE HIGH SPEED RAIL OTHER THINGS AND AND NOT FOCUS ON ON ON EDUCATION SO ON THIS IS THIS IS ATTENTION HERE AND I'M NOT SURE THERE'S. A CLEAR ANSWER I I'M SO MY RESPONSE WAS WHAT A REALLY GOOD POINT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WOULD TAKE TO. ONE. I'M. THIS STATE BOARD IS THE CASE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GROW YOUR EAR HERE INCREASING THE POWER THE STATE PORTING YOU'RE ALSO TALKING HOW THE STATE CHANGING THE WAY IT'S CONSTITUTED MEANING GIVING THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. AYE AYE AYE OPPORTUNITY HELP CHOOSE WHO'S ON THE STATE BOARD SO IT'S THE STATE BOARD AND THEN THE GOVERNOR AND YOU LOOK AT HOW THINGS REALLY WORK RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. THE STATE BOARD IS WHERE THE POWERS AND IT'S WORKED QUITE WELL THAT HIS WORD IS NOW UNDER THIS GOVERNOR THE WAY IT'S BEEN DONE ELIMINATED POSITION. W. I'LL WITHOUT THE MAUREEN DIMARCO POSITION ELIMINATE THE MAUREEN DIMARCO POSITION HE HE. CONSOLIDATED QUITE HONESTLY THE AUTHORITY UNDER. YOU KNOW MY CURSED AND IF THE AND AND AND THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE STATE BOARD. IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN A PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP OVERALL BETWEEN THE STATE BOARD GOVERNOR AND AND AND AND I S. B. I TO RELIGION IN GENERAL. ON BUT IT'S BABE DONE IT'S A LOT OF THIS IN PRACTICE HAS COME UNDER AND WE'RE SAYING INSTITUTIONALIZE THAT STRUCTURE. I'M I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN THE STRUCTURE WERE PROPOSING. THAT THE FBI IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE THEY'RE NOT ADMINISTRATOR THEIR EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE FOR KIDS IN EDUCATION AND YOUNG PEOPLE ON THIS THING AND THEY ARE THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVE THE TIME INSTEAD OF MANAGING. THE STATE THAT THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE THEY'RE THERE TO BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IF WE DID ELECTED GOVERNOR WHO WAS A LOUSY ON EDUCATION OR DIDN'T CARE ABOUT EDUCATION WAS. WORRIED ABOUT WHATEVER THAT PARTICULAR GOVERNOR MIGHT BE DIVERTED THEY'RE DIVERTING THEIR ATTENTION DO YOU HAVE A STRONG ELECTED OFFICIAL TO POKE TO RETURN THE FOCUS TO THOSE ISSUES. INCLUDING AT THE HIGHER ED LEVEL WHICH WAS YOUR EARLIER QUESTION BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE INVOLVED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL AT THE CAL THE REGION'S LEVEL. AND AND CAL STATE LEVEL SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS THEIR DESTRUCTION WOULD ROUGH THAT WEEK THAT THE PEOPLE ELECTED TO DO BUT THEN DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS ANY. IN THE THIRD SEPTEMBER WAS ASKING ABOUT SECTOR STAY THE AGM THAT'S TRUE THEY RUN COMPLEX AGENCY DO. I AND. YOU KNOW EDUCATION COURSE HAS A WHOLE LOCAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE COMPONENT TO THIS THAT DOESN'T. EXISTING QUITE THE SAME WAY OTHER D. A.'S LIKE IT OR NOT ALSO REGISTER RECORDERS. AT THE COUNTY LEVELS IN THE AND EDUCATE ON THE ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATION AS IT RELATES TO THE SECRETARY STATE. I'M CERTAINLY THEIR LOCAL LOCAL PROSECUTORS AND LOCAL COURTS. I'M. YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE EDUCATION SUCH A BIGGER PART OF THE BUDGET CRACK. AND SO MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT ALIGNED IS FOR THAT REASON ALONE TO TO GET THE GOVERNOR AND. A GREATER SENSE OF BRIAN. BUT IT IS A BIG QUESTIONS I IDEA AND I I MIGHT THE PART WHY ONE HAVE HEARINGS FOR US THAT CAN SIT BACK AND AND NOW SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AND. BUT BUT I THINK YOU TO SOME EXTENT THE BURDEN OF PROOF. IT IS ON. YOU TO TO YOU THE PROPONENTS OF OF MAKING SUCH A BIG CHANGE IT BECAUSE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW. SURE WE MAY IF THE CHOICE WERE THAT WE WERE STARTING A NEW BRAND NEW STATE. YOU KNOW WOULD WE STRUCTURE THINGS THE WAY WE WE DO NOW YOU KNOW PERHAPS NOT MAYBE MORE LAWS WHICH IS OBSESSING BUT THE QUESTION IS. IF WE'RE GOING TO. TAKE ALL THE STEPS NECESSARY ALL THE A A UPHEAVAL ASSOCIATED AYE IS GOING TO BE WORTH IT. I'M NOT AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT I ACTUALLY THINK. THAT'S CANDIDLY A REALLY WELL OF GROW A GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT IT I WOULD ASSUME THAT HOW WE WOULD WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT IT. WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT IT IS WORTH IT YEAH BUT HAVING SAID IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND I ALSO THINK IT'S FAIR FOR YOU TO SAY. THAT WE SHOULD SUBMIT MORE EVIDENCE TO YOU AND I'M A AND WE WILL OF OF WHY WE BELIEVE THIS WILL DELIVER AND AS MUCH EVIDENCE AS WE CAN FIND THAT EXISTS WHICH. BASED ON WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE IS NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT IF NOT GOING TO BE THE UNIQUE WE TAILORED SCIENTIFIC STUDY THAT YOU MIGHT IDEALLY LIKE OUT. BUT I AGREE THAT THERE IS A BURDEN ON US TO AFFIRM BILLY SHOW THAT WHY THAT WILL HAPPEN WE WILL BE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THAT. I'M IN THE US AND BUT I ALSO THINK THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT STRUCTURE AND THAT THAT'S WHY GO BACK TO THE TIMING THIS IS EITHER GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR OR IT'S NOT. THIS IS THE RIGHT YEAR THAT THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IT IN IN TWENTY NINETEEN OR TWENTY TWENTY IT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN A YEAR WHERE. THE GOVERNOR IS TURNING OUT THE SPI IS TURNING OUT AND AND AND AND THEY DON'T HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY OR BROWN THEIR OWN PARTICULAR STUFF SO YOU LOOKING ABROAD STRUCTURAL ISSUE. IT'S THING DISCUSS WITH WISE PEOPLE AND WE'RE. VERY PLEASED I HAVE TWO VERY VERY WISE PEOPLE ARE GONNA COME UP TO THE NEXT PANEL. AND GIVE US SOME PERSPECTIVES ABOUT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE TO PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS SPACE. NOT GARY HART ARE FROM SECTOR EDUCATION ALSO FORMER STATE SENATOR AND I BELIEVE CHAIR THIS. AUGUST COMMITTEE. AND THEN ALSO GAVIN PAIN FORMED ITS CHIEF DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF INSTRUCTION WHO BRINGS A PERSPECTIVE HAVING SERVED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF OF THE AND THE DEPARTMENT DUCATION. AND WE'RE VERY MUCH LOOKING FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH DRIVING THANK YOU MISTER STARR THANK YOU. SO WE WELCOME YOU BACK TO THE SENATE. S. SENATOR HART. AND. AND LOOK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIRMAN HEN DEAD CHAIRMAN DONALD UP IN SUCH BE BACK IN FORTY TWO OR THREE AND LOOK AT THIS MILLION HIDEOUSLY INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT YOU. I'M. REALLY ENJOYED LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY CUT TODAY IN THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I THINK YOU RAISED ALL OF THE. PORTANTO ISSUES AND CONCERNS I'M I JUST TO TRY TO BUILD UPON YOUR. WHEN YOUR LAST QUESTIONS. THOSE SENATOR ALAN TO OF THE WITNESS WAS WHAT IS WHAT IS THE BIG ISSUE HERE WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS SOMEONE WHO SERVED. IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR TWENTY YEARS BUT ALSO AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER NOT FOR QUITE AS LONG AS HER. SUBLIMINAL DONALD BUT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS A HIGHSCHOOL TEACHER AND ALSO AS A RETURN OF EDUCATE. THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION IS IN A WHAT BROUGHT ME TO A LEGISLATURE MORE THAN THING ELSE IT'S WHAT I'M I DEEPLY CARE ABOUT. AND THE ISSUE I THINK THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT HERE IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION YOU HAVE TO ELECTED OFFICIALS. MAY EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. AND THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE IS THAT WHEN THOSE. INDIVIDUALS. ARE NOT IN ALIGNMENT THERE'S DISAGREEMENT WHETHER IT'S A PARTISAN DISAGREEMENT AND IDEOLOGICAL DISAGREEMENT A PERSONALITY DISAGREEMENT. IT'S AN ISSUE. AND THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THAT. THE GOVERNOR HAS ALMOST ALL OF THE POWER THE GOVERNOR HAS THE POWER OF THE PURSE. THE GOVERNOR HAS THE POWER OF VETO. OF THE GOVERNOR HAS THE POLICY OF APPOINTMENT. OF HIM THROUGH HIS STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE WAY THE STATUTE HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS. THE POLICY FOR EDUCATION REST NOT WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION BUT WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. BOB IT SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE BATTLES BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THERE HAPPENED BATTLES IN THE PAST. OF CURRENTLY WE HAVE. YOU KNOW. A QUITE FUNCTIONAL PEACEFUL RELATIONSHIP I THINK THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR THE STATE POURED. AND OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION BUT THAT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT JUST BE INSTRUCTED. OF FROM PERRANCE. MISTER TO SHARE WITH YOU YOU KNOW WHAT. SOME OF THOSE CONFLICTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. BECAUSE WE'D. THEY'RE LIKELY TO REEMERGE IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT IN HIGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS BUT THE LET JUST MADE NO MENTION TWO OR THREE OF THESE ONE IS. FIX UP THE CONFLICT IN SOME RESPECTS HAVE SPARKED SO MANY OF THE PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT HAVE CALLED FOR CHANGES. DEREK YOU KNOW THEM BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY NOTEWORTHY EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE NUTS QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH STUDIES IT REALLY IS REMARKABLE THAT OVER THE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE. AS WELL AS. ALL OF THESE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS HAVE COME TO THE SAME. THERE OUGHT TO BE MORE POWER THAT'S GIVEN TO THE GOVERNOR AND LIST TO THE SUPERINTENDENT IN PART BECAUSE. THAT'S THE DE FACTO OF RELATIONSHIP THAT THAT EXISTS AND WE OUGHT TO BE MORE. BUT I THINK FORTHCOMING AND. IN ESTABLISH AND AND I THINK IT ALSO ONE OTHER POINT SENATOR PAN MADE REFERENCE TO THIS. ITEM THE ISSUE OF I THINK CONFUSION IS AN IMPORTANT ONE I THINK THE ELECTORATE OFTENTIMES AND EDUCATORS AS WELL WHO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF AT THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BELIEVE IT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IT IS A YOU KNOW A VERY POWERFUL PERSON. THAT THEY HAVE FISCAL. AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAVE POLICY MAKING AUTHORITY WHEN. IN FACT THEY MAY NOT HAVE THAT MUCH IN THAT CAN BE MISLEADING I THINK TO A TO EDUCATORS. BLOW ME GET BACK TO JUST UP. OF THIS ISSUE ABOUT SOME OF THE CONFLICTS THAT EXISTED IN THE PAST AND I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE IT PLEASE JUST PASSING REFERENCE TO THE ISSUE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND GOVERNANCE AS RELEASED THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION. SO AS IT RELATES TO. THE PARTISAN NATURE I JUST PUT POINT OUT THAT OBVIOUSLY THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION IS A NONPARTISAN OFFICE. BUT IN FACT FOR THE TIME THAT I SEARCH THE LEGISLATURE YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. OF THE GOVERNOR'S TENDED TO BE REPUBLICAN. A REAGAN RIGHT BEFORE I GOT ELECTED THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN. WILSON DEUKMEJIAN AND. SCHWARZENEGGER ARM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS. A DEMOCRAT TED FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT'S BEEN SOMEONE WHO COMES OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE. PARTISAN. YOU KNOW PROMINENCES A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE A PRIOR TO TO THAT YOU HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE SERVING AS SUPERINTENDENT. WHO ARE REGISTERED DEMOCRATS BUT? INTO WEREN'T YOU KNOW PROMOTING THAT THAT THAT PHILOSOPHY BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THIS. PARTISAN DIFFERENCE WITH HER IN THE PAST AT LEAST REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND A DEMOCRATIC OF SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THERE THERE WERE ISSUES. AND. THERE WAS. I COULD. MENTION A NUMBER BUT THE ONE THAT COMES WITH THEM MOST PRODUCTS MIND IS A AND A GOVERNOR WHO FELT THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION WAS LIKELY GOING TO BE UPON. ARRIVAL LEAST THAT WAS THE RUMOR FELT THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE A SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION WAS GOING TO RUN AGAINST GOVERNOR. AND IT'S RESULT OF THE HAD BEEN VIEWED AS A POTENTIAL RIVAL AN OPPONENT. INTO ACTIONS WERE TAKEN BY THE GOVERNOR IN TERMS OF BUDGET TING. VETOES AND WHAT NOT THAT. WERE CONTRARY TO THE INTERESTS THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION AND I. FELT IN THAT SITUATION THAT THERE'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE IN THAT SITUATION WHERE KICKOFF EDUCATION I THINK AND SUFFER IF THE GOVERNOR. HAS IT OUT FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT BOB. SOMETIMES COMES UP AND IT IS THE ISSUE OF I THINK PERSONALITIES WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT POLITICS IF YOU HAVE A SUPERINTENDENT THAT HAS A STRONG PERSONALITY THAT HAS SOME IT SAY A BRASH PERSONALITY. AND SAYS ON OCCASION THINGS THAT THE GOVERNOR. A DOZEN APPRECIATE. THAT GOVERNOR ABUSES INTEMPERATE NOT FAIR INAPPROPRIATE. UP THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE THE THE GOVERNOR CAN. I THINK TAKE ACTION AGAINST TO THE SUPERINTENDENT AND ULTIMATELY TOWARDS. K. TWELVE EDUCATION THAT I THINK IS SO YOU KNOW IS SOMETIMES UNFORTUNATE. OF REFERENCE WAS MADE TO. THE DEMARCO POSITION. SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WHICH WAS CREATED. BY GOVERNOR WILSON. IN NINETEEN NINETY AND MAINTAINED BY GOVERNOR DAVIS AND GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AND AS WAS MENTIONED. HAS BEEN ELIMINATED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. ON THAT THE MINUS SIDE OF HAVING SUCH AN OFFICES WAS MADE REFERENCE IT TO SORT OF INCREASES THE NUMBER OF POINTS OF. OF VOTE THE AUTHORITY THAT CAN BE CONFUSING TO PEOPLE. THE POSITIVE ASPECT OF THAT IS THAT IT DOES HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE GOVERNOR IF THEY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOVERNOR WHO IS WORKING ON A DAILY BASIS WITH THE GOVERNOR ON K. TWELVE EDUCATION. AND MOVES AWAY FROM THIS SITUATION CENTER PAN MADE REFERENCE TO EARLIER THAT I THINK IS. NOT SO MUCH RECENTLY BUT IF YOU GO BACK. A COUPLE OF DECADES AS I DO WHERE THERE REALLY WAS A FEELING ON THE PART I THINK OF SOME GOVERNOR'S I WOULD SAY. IF NOT CONSCIOUSLY UNCONSCIOUSLY THAT EDUCATION ISN'T MY DOMAIN. THAT'S WE HAVE ELECTED CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER AND SO THE GOVERNOR DID NOT PAY PARTICULAR CLOSE ATTENTION OR AS MUCH ATTENTION AS THEY MIGHT IF THEY HAD SOMEONE IN THEIR CABINET. IN THE HORSESHOE THAT WAS ACTUALLY WORKING ON K. TWELVE I'M ISSUES. BOB BUT WHEN I WAS SERVING AS SECRETARY OF EDUCATION THE GOVERNOR. RATHER THAN USING THE OFFICE ENTIRELY AS HE POLICY MAKING OFFICE WHICH WAS WHAT IT WAS SET UP TO DO. UP BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR DID NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. DEEP TO THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION SOME ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES TO CARRY OUT PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNOR WERE NEAR AND DEAR TO THE GOVERNOR'S HEART. SO YOU HAVE THESE ISSUES PARTISANSHIP OF PERSONALITY DIFFERENCE OF LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE. THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ON OCCASION. AND THOSE THINGS REALLY GET IN THE WAY I THINK ON OCCASION OF ARM. NOT ONLY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP BUT. I THINK TO THE DETRIMENT OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION BECAUSE I MENTIONED EARLIER THE POWER REALLY RESTS WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO. SO IS THAT A POWER OVER THE SUIT ATTENDANT. YOU KNOW THEY CAN. SO THOSE HER. SOME COMMENTS AS IT RELATES TO MY EXPERIENCE. SERVING IN THE LEGISLATURE AND IN THIS POSITION OF SECRETARY VEGETATION AND THAT'S. REALLY I THINK SENSITIVE AND IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN OF THE GOVERNOR TOM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. PERSONALLY I THINK BASED UPON MY EXPERIENCE OF THE OFFICE OF THE ATTEND A PUBLIC INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE ABOLISHED. IN WE REALLY OUGHT A HAVE. A CLEARER ALIGNMENT OF. AUTHORITY AND IT REALLY OUGHT TO REST WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE AUTHORITY EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA AND. REGIONAL PEOPLE CAN DIFFER AS TO WHETHER THAT'S THE. BUT YOU KNOW TOO MUCH CONCENTRATION OF POWER BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE GOT A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE GOT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS I THINK THERE'S ALREADY. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DISPERSION OF OF. YOU KNOW OF HOWARD THAT TERM YOU KNOW THAT EXISTS. UP I DID WANT TO COMMENT JUST BRIEFLY IF I COULD MISTER CHAIRMAN ON THIS ISSUE OF HIGHER EDUCATION BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GOVERNANCE. SENATE MAY NOT BE UP ON IMPORTANT PART OF THE HEARING TODAY I'D I DO BELIEVE THAT. TRYING TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIGH K. TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN GOVERNANCE IS SOMETHING THAT IS WORTHY OF THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION. OF AND WE DO NOT HAVE AN OVERALL COORDINATING SYSTEM FOR OUR ENTIRE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND INCREASINGLY WE HAVE ISSUES. BETWEEN K. TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION THAT DESERVE ATTENTION ISSUES RELATING TO. COURSES THAT ARE TAKEN TEACHER REQUIREMENTS IN PREPARATION ARTICULATION OF BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OF I JUST NOTICED A RECENT THERE YESTERDAY IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES THERE WAS A STORY ABOUT. THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS STUDENTS THAT ARE NOT APPLYING FOR. CAL GRANTS OF THE APPLICATIONS ARE DOWN FIFTY PERCENT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION HAS IS GETTING THE WORD OUT TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS UP VERTICALLY WITH OUR OUR BADLY. FUNDED HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND SO THERE'S AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THIS TO NAY COMMISSION IN WORKING K. TWELVE AND IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT NOT ONLY. HAVING. THE SUPERINTENDENT. ON THE. COMMUNICABLE WHICH PORT OF A TRUST AND GOVERNOR'S SAYS FOODS SUPERINTENDENT IS ALREADY ON THE UC AND CSU. REGIONS AND BOARDS OF TRUSTEES BUT HAVING REPRESENTATION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT ON THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. MIGHT BE A WORTHWHILE THING MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE NEED IS SOME KIND OF A GOVERNANCE COORDINATING BODY I BELIEVE OF FOR ALL OF EDUCATION THAT REPRESENTS. THE LEADERS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS. OF I WOULD SUGGEST AT THIS POINT IN TIME HAVING THE SUPERINTENDENT AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. CERTAIN SUCH A BODY MISTER OF AN INFORMAL BODY THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS CALL THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION ROUNDTABLE THAT MEETS TWO OR THREE TIMES A YEAR AT THIS REALLY DOES HAVE A STAFF A DOZEN HAVE RESOURCES IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY. CLEAR. MANDATE BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE THERE OUGHT TO BE A STATUTE THAT WOULD REQUIRE SUCH OF A BODY. OF IT OUGHT HAVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE'S ROLE FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT AND FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION A. TO PLAY IN THAT REGARD SO IT'S. IN JUST ONE SUGGESTION THAT I I WANTED TO MAKE BEFORE. CONCLUDING MY REMARKS. VERY INTERESTING AND I'VE TAKEN A LOT AND THAT'S ALL WE ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS WE GET TENSTA. TO DO THAT SO LET'S ONE WE. TURN. TO OUR NEXT PANELIST KEVIN PAYNE WHO IS THE FORMER CHIEF WCW STRUCTURE AND. TO GIVE HIS TESTIMONY WHO THANK CHAIRMAN ALAN AND. CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS I I I I APPRECIATE EXPLORING THIS TOPIC I FOR PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE BEING INVITED TO. COMMENT. M.. COUPLE THINGS UP FRONT I APPLAUD COMMONSENSE FOR TRYING TO ADDRESS A VEXING PROBLEM IT'S BEEN A PROMISE OF WE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING IS A. SONG THAT GOES ALONG AND COMMON SENSE IS A TRUSTED VOICE IN THE SPACE ACT TOLD JIM ANYTIME TODAY HELPED RAISE MY KIDS. AND THAT WITHOUT COMMON SENSE. MARKETS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER SHAPE THAN THAN THEY PROBABLY ARE NOW NOT TO SAY THEY'RE IN GREAT SHAPE. HEALTH SENATOR LITTLE OF A SHOUT OUT TO YOU SEE ES FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE IN COMPILING. LE THE THEM TO THE DATA STRUCTURAL. BIG STRUCTURES THAT EXIST IN IN IN STATES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT DERIVED THEREFROM. BUT I DO WANT TO THE LIMIT OF THE BACK ON ME. FOR SOME OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME I SERVED FOR FOURTEEN YEARS HAS LED STAFF. I IN THE BUILDING WITH SENATOR SOME WOMEN THAT AND SENATOR JACK O'CONNELL AND BUT THE DISTRICT OF THE CAPITAL. IN THAT TIME WE SERVED UNDER THREE DIFFERENT GOVERNOR'S TO MAJOR IN WILSON DAVIS. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY PART LEADERSHIP STAFF AND US SENATE O'CONNELL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EDUCATION BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR MANY YEARS. I THEN WENT WITH HIM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND AND SERVE TOOK THE LEGISLATIVE HOUSE HAD OFTEN BUT THAT. EXECUTIVE HAT ON AND SERVED FOR ALMOST EIGHT YEARS AS THE CHIEF DEPUTY A CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; WE SERVER THAT</u> TO GOVERNOR SAVES FROM SCHWARZENEGGER. NOW WE HAD ROBUST CONVERSATIONS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME AT THE SIZE THE WORK WE HAD TO DO IT AT THAT. AT THE DEPARTMENT CONVERSATIONS RUN P. SIXTEEN. OUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT WE TRIED TO LEASE SAYS STATEWIDE CONVERSATIONS. AND WE WERE THE PROGENITORS IN AND THE SPONSORS OF THE EARLIEST OF THE GETTING ON THE FACTS STUDIES WHICH I THINK. RESULTED IN MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND AFTER THAT I SPENT THREE YEARS WITH THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION RUNNING THEIR POLICY SHOP FOR EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. A AND HAD EXPERIENCE FROM THAT IT IN MANY DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND THE OVERTURE SORT OF MANY YEARS AT IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AS A CONSULTANT TO AN ADVOCATE A COACH AND A FACILITATOR CONVERSATIONS MOST RECENTLY I. STILL ATTEND THE CONVERSATION WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE WE'RE HAVING IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. OBVIOUSLY MY COMMENTS ARE MY OWN I DON'T REPRESENT ANYBODY IN THIS. BUT THEY'RE BASED ON THESE COUPLE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE. DON'T TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE FROM A FROM A SAMPLE OF POLICY AND POLITICS. AND SO THESE ARE MY MAIN POINTS THE THEY ARE AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF EVIDENCE HERE TODAY THE DISH WITH NO PERFECT STRUCTURE TO ENSURE. EFFICIENCY AND I THINK EFFICIENCY IS PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT HERE. EVEN IF THERE WERE I WOULD STILL POSITED THAT AND I WOULD CHOOSE THAT THERE BE A STRONG ELECTED SPI AS A KEY COMPONENT OF THAT STRUCTURE. MY THIRD POINT IS THAT SOME OF ITS ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA HISTORICAL AND PRACTICAL PERSON CONSIDERATIONS PREVENT BIG STRUCTURAL CHANGE. AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN THAT THE PREPONDERANCE OF STUDIES AND THE LACK HUNDREDS OF ACTION HAS HURT GIVEN IT TO THEM. AND I THINK ALSO MY WOULD LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE TO IS THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN TOUCHED UPON TO BOTH AND THAT SORT OF THE. CREE QUE AND EARLY LEARNING AND IN THE POST SECONDARY PARTLY QUESTION THAT THAT. THE GROUP A GREAT CONVERSATION TO BE HAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT LINKAGES OF THOSE AND ENTER. OUR INTER SEGMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY NOTHING IS A GREAT CONVERSATION. PERHAPS THE THAT COMMITTEES CAN UNDERTAKE A GOING FORWARD. I AM SO OBVIOUSLY A DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF OF ORGANIZATIONS THIS IS MY FIRST POINT EVERY GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IS FROM WASHINGTON TO. LOUISIANA TO NEW YORK TO MASSACHUSETTS THAT. YOU'VE HAD OF THE PRESENTATION RECESS AND THERE ARE SOME OF FOR BAIT GREAT MODELS. A FORGOTTEN GENERAL BUCKETS OF GOVERNANCE AND THEN TWELVE STATES HAVE DONE THEIR OWN THING OUTSIDE OF THOSE AND. AND IN YOU KNOW GET SINCE I THINK I HAVE WE SEEN THAT THERE IS ONE THAT RISES TO THE TOP AND SO DEMONSTRATES TO ME THAT THERE. REALLY IS NO PERFECT STRUCTURE. TIME FOR OPERATING THIS ENTERPRISE IF THERE IF THERE WAS WOULD HAVE IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE HAVING ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO ANY SORT OF FIX IT THAT WAY. TO MY FUNDAMENTAL CONCLUSION ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND SORT OF BEEN THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATIONS WHEN I WAS PLEDGE THAT FROM WHEN I WAS OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT. STRUCTURES REALLY THROUGH THE MATERIAL. UNLESS IT ISN'T AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS THAT GARY ISLA OUTLINED. M.. STRUCTURE IS A STRUCTURES BLAME IN SOME INSTANCES FOR ISSUES THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE HAPPENING. POLITICAL PERSONAL PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENTS ARE POSSIBLE AND PROBABLE IN ANY STRUCTURE THE HAVE WHETHER IT'S ELECTED OR APPOINTED OFFICIALS INEFFICIENCY IS POSSIBLE AND. REGULAR NOT UNDER ANY STRUCTURE THAT YOU HAVE IS THE NATURE IN THE FORM OF OUR GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY HISTORY LEADERSHIP. MY SECOND POINT IS THAT ULTIMATELY I SUPPORT THE NOTION. THAT ISN'T TRYING TO OUR CONSTITUTION THAT THERE IT THAT THEY'RE BEING ELECTED PERSON WHOSE SOLE JOB IT IS. TO PAY ATTENTION TO OUR STUDENTS. ONE PERSON THE GUARDIAN OF THE PROMOTER THE PROTECTOR THE NIGER THE SUPERINTENDENT IF YOU WILL. OF THE NEEDS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE STATE WHO REPRESENT OUR FUTURE IF YOU ARE ECONOMIC SUCCESS IN OUR SOCIAL SUCCESS IN FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA. MY SENSE IS THAT IT EDUCATION'S A GOBLET EXERCISE WHAT IS MY SENSE MY EXPERIENCE IS EDUCATION IS A COMPLICATED A TENER PRAWNS. LET DESERVES NO LESS LEADERSHIP AND SINGLE MINDED FOCUS THAN DOES JUSTICE WHO'S MORE COMPLICATED WE THOUGHT HAVE. WAS CERTAINLY WHEN WE GOT THERE. I'M. YEAH WHO SINGLE MINDED FOCUS IS IMPORTANT. AS JUSTICE TREASURY. OR EVEN INSURANCE. SO TO THE HISTORICAL ON PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT. WE'RE IN IT AND EXTENDED PERIOD IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT OF GOOD RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S A STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ELECTIVES SUPERINTENDENT. AND ALONG WITH YOU FUNDAMENTAL AND LASTING CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE TO THE STRUCTURE OF EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH AND IT HAS ALWAYS IT IN HOUSE HELD IN A VERY POSITIVE ACTIVITY ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE'S MOST PARTICULARLY WHAT'S HAPPENING THE PARALLEL. PREVIOUSLY. UNDERGOVERNOR DAVIS AT SET TO PRETEND O'CONNELL WITH A SIMILAR VERY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP. ESPECIALLY WHEN GARY WAS THE. SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. AND THE SUPERINTENDENTS PHILOSOPHY THAN WHAT WAS ALWAYS GOOD GOVERNANCE DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS THE PLAYERS IN EACH GAME GAUGE WITH EACH OTHER FORTHRIGHTLY. FAIRLY AND HONORABLY IT WAS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS. ABOUT TRANSPARENCY REQUIRED US TO BE THAT TO HEAR THE NOTION THAT THERE WERE THAT THERE BE NO SURPRISES AND THOSE WERE OUR RULES OF ENGAGEMENT WHEN WE ENGAGE WITH THE STATE BOARD. WHEN HE WAS THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT WAS EASY AT TIMES AND SORELY TESTED AT OTHER TIMES BECAUSE. ULTIMATELY OF COURSE AS WE ALL KNOW WE HAD A VERY BAD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. I COULD TELL YOU STORIES BUT NOT BUT OFF MIKE. AND THE STORIES IS GARY RELATED TO. FROM PREVIOUS SBI'S IN PREVIOUS GOVERNORS ARE ARE LEGENDARY EQUALLY LEGEND. FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT LEASE FROM POLITICAL PRACTICAL STANDPOINT FROM MY FROM MY STANDPOINT MOST OFTEN IN CALIFORNIA THE CONTEXT IS THE CONTEXT IN ITS TO THE CONUNDRUM IS CAST AS CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FBI AND THE GOVERNOR'S THROUGH HIS OR HER BOARD OF EDUCATION. THE PREMISE IS THAT TO FIX THE PROBLEM ONE OF THE PLAYERS HAS TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY DISEMPOWERED AND USUALLY THAT'S THE SPI. BUT OPPOSITE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL. SO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE REAL CHANGE TO CHANGE THE ORDER OF BUSINESS. MEANS THAT IT REQUIRES A AND A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. WE'VE SEEN IT THAT VOTERS LIKE TO VOTE FOR PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT THEM. FUNNY THING ABOUT THAT. SO IT'S NOT A PRACTICAL SOLUTION OCCUR IN THE FBI. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST POINTED OUT THAT THERE WERE THREE TIMES IN THE PAST ALREADY AND THEY WERE NOT SUCCESS. TOOK ME TECH TO GIVEN THE STI AND THAT ARE THE QUESTION ON THE OTHER SIDE WHAT GOVERNOR WOULD OPT TO GET RID OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION OR DISEMPOWERED THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. GOVERNOR'S LIKE TO AND ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE INFLUENCE CONTROL. AND THEIR VOICE THROUGH THEIR APPOINTEES AS CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. SO NO GOVERNOR'S GOING TO GIVE THAT UP. SO. THEN I TURNED THEN I TURN TO THE COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL AND. YOU'VE HAD IT BOMBING TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD PEOPLE COME BEFORE YOU AND SAY YOU KNOW I LIKE HALF OF THAT BILL. IN THIS INSTANCE I LOVE THE CONCEPT I COME FROM A REALLY GOOD PLACE. I APPLAUD THE NOTION THAT COMMONSENSE READ THE TABLE ABOUT ALL THE SEGMENTS BEING CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER. MY READ THEIR PROPOSAL HOWEVER THIS HASN'T LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT IT WON'T ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES MIGHT OBFUSCATE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. I'M AND PERHAPS HAS CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES. THE OTHER POINT THAT I'D MENCKEN WAS ALREADY MADE IN THE IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY. IS THAT THERE ARE NON STATE COMPONENTS TO THIS EQUATION THAT ARE THAT HAVE RISEN IN IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY. IN AN ERA OF SUBSIDIARITY WHAT ABOUT THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS WHAT ABOUT THE CTC. WHAT ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE C. C. E.? DISTRICT LEADERSHIP DISTRICT BOARDS. AND I THINK. BOTH THE TERMINAL DONALD SENATOR PAN IN THE SETTLEMENT KILEY HAVE MENTIONED THAT THOSE FACTORS ARE PRETTY KEY ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW ORDER OF BUSINESS WITHOUT HAPPEN LCF AT. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT GOVERNANCE AND OR STRUCTURE HAS TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE PARTS. OF K. TWELVE AND THE END AND SERVE HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY WITH THE OTHER SEGMENTS INVOLVED. TO MY LAST POINT IS THAT I'D POSIT WE SHOULD HAVE A LARGER CONVERSATION NOT ABOUT STRUCTURE. BUT ABOUT FUNCTION ABOUT SORT OF JOINT AND SEVERAL ACCOUNTABILITY OF ONE SEGMENT TO THE OTHER. EARLY HEAD AND PRETTY EASY AND THEN CREE QUE LINKED TO K. TWELVE AND RESPONSIBLE TO EACH OTHER QUE TROUBLING TO POST SECONDARY ROOM AND IN SOME MEASURE RESPONSIBLE TO EACH OTHER. ALL SEGMENTS ANSWERABLE TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE OBVIOUSLY OUR SOCIETY OUR ECONOMY AND OUR STUDENTS PRIMARILY. IT COULD BE A BILL IT IF THAT'S NOT FEASIBLE IT COULD BE BUDGET ACTION VERY EASILY IF NOT IT COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF WAYS BUT I THINK THE TIMING IS RIGHT FROM THE STAND POINT OF. MISTER STARR AS PEOPLE ARE WORKING WELL TOGETHER TO ENGAGE IN A ROBUST CONVERSATION ALONG THOSE LINES OF. I AM HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE PROCESS TOOK DIRECT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS FORCING THE PLAYERS THEMSELVES TO COOPERATE AND COORDINATE. AND OBVIOUSLY I BELIEVE THAT YOU THAT IS. YOUR BAILIWICK AND YOUR STRENGTH. I'M OBVIOUSLY IN EAGER FOR QUESTIONS THANKS SO MUCH. WELL REALLY DO APPRECIATE NEITHER VERY THOUGHTFUL AND NUANCE A PRESENTATIONS IN AND DOWN. NO I I THINK AND I DO I DO APPLAUD THE FOLKS WHO COMMONSENSE FOR HELPING TO SPARK THIS DISCUSSION. I. I SUPPOSE I'VE A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS. IT SEEMS SO SERVE YOU BOTH PRESENTED TO ADD TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES I WANT HIM PARTS APART YEARS A LITTLE BIT. AND MISTER PAYNE GIVEN SOME OF THE COMMENTS ARE MADE BY MISTER HART. I YOU WERE INNOCENT HEART WAS TALKING A BIT ABOUT. BUT AND THIS IS A GROTESQUE PARAPHRASE PERHAPS BUT HE'S BASICALLY SAYING. THE POWERS ARE IN THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNOR FOR THE MOST PART LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT AND COHERENT ABOUT IT. NOW I THINK IS THATTHE CONCEPT BEHIND THE COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL. ALLEN. WHAT'S YOUR IMMEDIATE REACTION TO THAT STATEMENT. I CAN I CAN JUST READ THE STATEMENTS ARE BOTH THROUGH THE BOTH THROUGH THE INTERACTION OF THE GOVERNOR HAS WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE INTERACTION AND POWER THAT HE IS INVESTED IN THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES SPECIALLY. THAT. ULTIMATE POWER RESTS WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THAT. IT AND. CAN HAS BEEN THAT WAY FOR SOME FOR SOME MATTER OF TIME. I WILL SAY HOWEVER THAT THE INTERACTION. BOTH FISCALLY AND PROGRAMMATIC LAY BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES. IS A VERY COMPLICATED AND NUANCED INTERACTIONS WELL HAVING TO DO WITH ISSUES OF OF. OF COULD SERVE CURRICULUM HAVE YOU DO ISSUES OF APPORTIONMENT HAVE YOU DO WITH ISSUES OF ANY NUMBER OF THINGS BOTH INTERACTIONS WITH THEM IN WITH INTERACTIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT IS AS I SAID A COMPLICATED ENTERPRISE AND ONE PERSON IN CHARGE IT WITH THIS WITH A KIND OF. SINGLE MINDED FOCUS ON EDUCATION AS THE AND THE OUTCOMES FOR THE STUDENTS AS A FOCUS IS IS APPROPRIATE. I THINK IN THE IN THE CONSTRUCT A CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY AS BIG AS IT IS ESPECIALLY WITH THIS MANY DISTRICTS A THOUSAND DISTRICTS AND TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS AND. ANY NUMBER CHARTERS I'VE LOST COUNT ABOUT THE NUMBER. DID YOU FIND WHEN YOU WERE AT THE THE PARA DUCATION CERTAIN OF SUPERINTENDENT. THAT IT WOULD. DID THE. CONFUSED LINES OF AUTHORITY. WERE BECOMING REALLY DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR ABILITY TO YEAR WORKING IN DID YOU FEEL KIND OF. A NEED FOR A MORE CLEAR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK ITS A MATTER AND I THINK I I WOULD THEN I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO REFERENCE MY EARLIER POINTS ABOUT THAT WHEN THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE GOOD AND WHEN WE WERE COMMUNICATING WELL AND. HAVING. DON'T DON'T ME WRONG WE HAD VERY ROBUST CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICES IN OURSELVES IN THE SECTOR'S OUTSIZE OURSELVES. NAM WE HAD VERY ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WITH IT WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION BUT WE WERE. ACTING. US GONNA BLAME TRANSPARENTLY WITH EACH OTHER. COM THAT. WASN'T THAT THERE WAS MUCH LESS CAN HOOK CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT WAS COMING OUT OF THAT AND WE WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE JOB THAT HAD TO BE DONE. OFF FROM THAT WHEN THINGS GOT CONFUSING AND WHEN THAT THINGS GOT ADVERSARIAL IT BECAME. IT THAT THAT SORT OF IT IT. CASCADED INTO THE DISTRICTS IN A CASCADED INTO THE COUNTIES MOTHER CONFUSION THAT RESULTED UP HERE AND THIS HAPPENED TOO MANY TIMES IN RECENT HISTORY HASN'T I'M NOT NOT VERY RECENT HISTORY BUT. NO IT HAS IT HAS HAPPENED OF A LOT OF TIMES IN. YEAH. I'M. IT'S CERTAIN IT IS THEN. THAT IS UNFORTUNATE NATURE OF POLITICS AND ESPECIALLY THE POLITICS IS POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT WE DO IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THERE IS DISTRIBUTED LEADERSHIP AND THERE. AND THESE CONFLICTS CAN ARISE THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO LEGISLATE BEHAVIOR IT'S VERY HARD TO. LEGISLATE CONTROL. THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN. AND OBVIOUSLY I WILL LEAVE IT TO YOU BECAUSE I HAD THE ANSWERS THAT WOULD OF ALREADY. JOHN TRIED TO IMPLEMENT THEM AND THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN REQUIRE THEIR TO BE SUFFICIENT REPORTING THAT THE SEGMENTS FOR INSTANCE ARE THEMSELVES COMMUNICATING WELL ENOUGH. SO SO WHAT YOU'RE ESSENTIAL CRITICISM OF THE OF THE PROPOSAL BY THE. YOU KNOW YOU MEAN TO ALTER THE THE WAY THEY DESCRIBE IT THE IDEA IS YOU'RE GONNA. ADDRESS THE COHERENCE ISSUE BY ESSENTIALLY MOVING THE CD UNDER THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN GIVE THE SUPERINTENDENT. BOB. RULES TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE ADVOCACY ASPECT OF THE POSITION THE BULLY PULPIT. BUT BUT TAKE AWAY THE THE SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURAL A JURISDICTIONAL TENSIONS THAT COULD EXIST THICKET OUT TO UNDERMINE THE BROADER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF IS A FIGHT GOING ON THAT INCIDENT IN THE GOVERNOR. I I'LL BE FRANK THAT. WITHOUT SU LEADERS HUMBLY PUPPET ARE WANTING THEIR VERY STRONG THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT. THEY'VE A VOTE ON THE REGION'S IS A VOTE ON REGION SAY VOTE A VOTE ON THE TRUST. THE SAME IT WOULD BE I'M WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHERE YOU HAVE A VOTE ON BOTH BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO CAUSE CANCER. THAT'S WHY I LIKE HALF THE PROPOSAL. THE. THE. THE NOTION THAT THERE IS LINE AUTHORITY AND THERE IS THERE IS THE ABILITY TO SANCTION EITHER IN THE APARTMENT PROCESS OR IN SOME OTHER PROCESS THE. THAT WHATEVER YOU'RE KIND OF REALLY PROCESS THERE THERE IS A LINE AUTHORITY I'M. MEANS THERE IS LEVERAGE MEANS AREAS. TRUE AUTHORITY IN THE IN THE POSITION AND THAT IS I THINK ESSENTIAL AND IMPORTANT. DICK ANSWERS. YEAH. NOT AGAINST NOT AGAINST OBVIOUSLY USE HERE CSU BUT IT BUT IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF DISTRICTS AS WELL AS ESPECIALLY. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR WHAT FOR THERE TO BE LINE AUTHORITY FOR THERE TO BE. AN ARBITER OF DISPUTE AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING THAT WORK. BUT DOES NOT EXIST UNDER BOTH THE CURRENT MODEL AND UNDER THIS PROPOSED MODEL. AND I'VE ACTUALLY I'M ACTUALLY HAVING IT RESIDE WITH THE FBI AS OPPOSED THE GOVERNOR. THE LINE AUTHORITY THAT THE THE OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY WOULD REST OF THE GOVERNMENT'S. SO. SO THERE IS A LINE AUTHORITY I AGREE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE TO BE LIVES ALREADY AB BUT BUT BUT BUT THAT. THAT DOESN'T GO AWAY DISK MOVES A DIFFERENT. PERSON TRUE BUT IT MOVED BUT IT WAS ANOTHER PERSON BUT IT ALSO BELIEVE LEAVES THE PERSON WHO WAS ELECTED BY THE PUBLIC. TO BE THE. PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE SCHOOLS. YEAH. WRITE TO YOUR ELECTED GOVERNOR FOR ANY HOUSE FOR A HOST OF REASONS INFRASTRUCTURE ROADS BUT ASSEMBLY SO WE ALSO LIKE THE GOVERNOR TO BE TOWARDS OF THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE INDEED SENT THAT PASSED THE BUDGETS IN EDUCATION. I I I THINK IF YOU WERE TO ASK. A LOT OF VOTERS THEY WOULD THINK THAT EDUCATION BEEN IMPORTANT PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PORTFOLIO. ABSOLUTELY. YEAH ALSO BUT ALSO SAY LIKE WITH LIKE WITH JUST OF LIKE WITH TREASURY SO ONE PERSON IS FALSE ALL FOCUSES THOSE ISSUES IS THAT ESSENTIAL IMPORTANT AND. THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN THAT'S A THAT'S. SOMETHING THEY WANT. TURNED ON. QUESTION THOUGHTS BOMB NOTICED LISTENING OKAY. I'D LOVE TO ADJUSTING AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AS YOU DO BRING A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE TO THIS TABLE. SO MUCH APPRECIATE YOU SHARING YOUR. A DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS THAT SOMETIMES THEY OVERLAPS. CAN I ASK YOU CENTER HARD YOU BROUGHT UP THIS WHOLE I'M. GONNA CUT TO FIND THE CALVET EDUCATIONAL ROUNDTABLE. AND WHAT IS EXISTED IN THE PAST THAT. YOU KNOW ALONG HIS I KNOW WE HAD WE HAD SEPAK FOR EXAMPLE. WHICH DID WORK ON SHARING DATA AT THE HIGHER ED LEVEL THAT CERTAIN SOMETHING THAT A BUNCH OF US LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. BUT IS THIS IS WITH A SOMETHING YOU LOOKED OUT WHEN YOU WERE IN THE SENATE OR IN AND SECRETARY POSITION. OUT BY DID EXIST IN FORMAL BASIS I MEAN I I. THIS GOVERNOR'S. YOU KNOW. THEN. TYPICALLY NOT VERY INTERESTED IN CREATING NEW GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES. I MEAN THAT REQUIRED FUNDING. BUT YOU KNOW. BUT AN INTERESTING IDEA I LOVE TO FLY CELIBATE. IF THIS IS JUST KIND OF EVOLVED I THINK IT'S KIND OF AN INFORMAL THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY DIRECTIVE FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR ANYONE ELSE THAT I KNOW OF A. PARTICULARLY WITH THE DEMISE OF SEPAK AND THE HIGHER EDUCATION COORDINATING. COUNCIL HAVING SOME MECHANISM BY WHICH. OF PEOPLE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEADERSHIP CAN COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER THIS WAS SORT OF ESTABLISHED AND I THINK APPROPRIATELY AS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC IS. PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE K. TWELVE OBVIOUSLY. HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO US YOU KNOW TO PLAY. UP IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW THIS GOVERNOR I THINK ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE DONE STATUTORILY TO TRY TO CREATE SUCH A. POEM YOU NOBODY PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE MET YOU KNOW VERY FAVORABLY BUT. YOU KNOW PERHAPS NEXT YEAR THERE COULD BE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. I DO THINK THAT YOU COULD YOU COULD FUND THIS EASILY BY ASKING EACH OF THE SEGMENTS THEY WOULD PROBLY WOULDN'T WOULDN'T LIKE THIS TO SAY THAT TO NO ONE TENTH OF ONE PERCENT OF YOUR. OPERATING ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET UP OUGHT TO GO TO FUND ACTIVITIES HAVING TO DO WITH THE THIS A COORDINATION ARTICULATION FUNCTION I THINK THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO TO DO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU KNOW HOW UP ELABORATE. YOU KNOW YOU FUNDING MECHANISMS. YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT I'M I'M I'M SURE THAT'S RIGHT. WHERE SOME SO YOU MENTIONED SENATE COMMISSION WE TALKED WITH THE BOARD GOVERNOR'S WHAT ARE SOME OF THEIR POSITIONS WHERE SOME OF THE BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS AT THE CSU BY TO HAVE? BY THE WAY THERE'S OTHER WAYS WE CAN THINK ABOUT THIS WE DON'T JUST WE COULD GIVE APPOINTMENT POWER TO THE SOUP. AS WELL YOU KNOW THEY WOULD HAVE A SEAT ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS MAYBE GET. ONE ADDITIONAL PAYMENT. HOW TO I DON'T MORE I MEAN THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN THINK ABOUT THIS? TOBY INTERESTING ABBA YOU MENTIONED TO NAY COMMISSION BOARD OF GOVERNORS OTHER OTHER OTHERS OUT THERE THAT THAT THAT ARE VERY AND IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONALLY COMMISSIONS ARE BOARDS THAT. WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF. THE POTENTIAL SUPERINTENDENT ROLE. THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE. AND THE CDC CERTAINLY ASIDE TO SYRIA. QUESTION TO DETENTION. ACTUALLY IN THOSE COULDN'T MISSION TEACHER CREDENTIALING THERE IS. A DESIGNEES FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE THAT SERVES AND THEY HAVE VOTING AUTHORITY ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT A FORMAL MEMBER. OF THE YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION BUT. IN ESSENCE THEY HAVE HUB. VOTING AUTHORITY WHICH GIVES THEM POWER THEY COULD BE MADE OF YOU KNOW A FORMAL UP YOU KNOW FORMAL MEMBER AND I I THINK THAT WOULD BE QUITE APPROPRIATE. ACROSS AND SO THEY DON'T TAKE CARE OF. I THINK THIS ISSUE OF TRYING TO HAVE SOME KIND OF UGH UGH GOVERNANCE COUNCIL OF ALL THE HEADS IS IS REALLY KEY. I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME OTHER COMMISSIONS THAT. ONE COULD. FERRET OUT THAT YOU COULD* WHO PRETENDED TO SERVE ON BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S. YOU KNOW THAT'S. THAT'S GOOD BUT THAT'S IS CRITICAL IS HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE OF THE POWERS THAT BE BETWEEN HIGHER EDUCATION AND YOU KNOW IT TO TWELVE AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I THINK FOOD BE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE PERHAPS THE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. SERVE ON THIS AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S. YOU KNOW HAS A YOU KNOW. SOMEONE AT THE TABLE OF FROM THE K. TWELVE COMMUNITY. KATE KATE PARTS APART YOU'RE PREPARED SUGGESTION THAT YOUR OPINION IS THAT WE OUGHT TO JUST GET RID OF THAT. BUT POLCY PRETENDS POSITIONAL TOGETHER. IT IS THAT IT DO YOU DO I MAKE THAT. RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE OR DO YOU HAVE THAT FEELING BECAUSE. ULTIMATELY YOU THINK THAT IT. THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IS IS DECEPTIVE TO THE VOTERS THAT DID THE POWERS AND THE GOVERNOR WE CREATE THIS POSITION THAT. IT IS VOTERS THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE VOTING FOR SOMEONE WHO'S RUNNING THE SCHOOLS AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY AND. DECEPTIVE IN AND WE ARE JUST. DO AWAY WITH IT FOR THAT REASON. DECEPTIVE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF THE TWO STRONG WORD I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON I THINK THAT'S A CONTRIBUTING REASONS TO IT BUT I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY IS TO HAVE TO CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR. FUNDING AND POLICY IS. YOU KNOW DOWN THE ROAD LEADS TO THESE PROBLEMS THAT WE DON'T HAVE NOW BUT W'VE HAD A IN IN THE PAST AND. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I JUST THINK THE GOVERNOR IS THE KEY PLAYER THE GOVERNOR NEEDS TO ASSUME. RESPONSIBILITY AND HOLD HER HAVE SOME SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN IT ON A REST WITH HIM AND. SITUATION IS I THINK YOU BEGIN REMARKS BY SAYING. NEW THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS YOU KNOW IN EVERY ONCE IN CHARGE BUT NO ONE'S ACCOUNTABLE. I THINK THAT FUNDAMENTAL. STATEMENT TICKETS IT THE REASON% FOR WHY THE OFFICE OF AND IN MY VIEW YOU KNOW IS YOU KNOW WAS QUESTIONABLE NOW. WE TRIED THREE DIFFERENT TIMES TO ELIMINATE THE OFFICE AND VOTERS SAYS RIGHT. KEVIN MADE REFERENCE TO. ARE ARE JEALOUS AND. OF THEIR OF ABILITY TO YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE TO OFFICE SO THE CHANCES OF ELIMINATING THE OFFICE OF THEM ARE NOT. VERY PUBLIC VERY GOOD ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN FIFTY YEARS SO MAYBE. TO BE TRIED AGAIN BUT I WOULD NOT BE UP TO MISSING RIGHT THAT. IT'S RUNNING GOOD VOTERS DON'T LIKE NEW. POLITICAL POSITIONS BUT I DON'T LIKE TAKING AWAY ALL ONCE IT'S THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE. IT'S VERY INTERESTING WELD SOME YEARS IT WAS OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO THEY ACTUALLY ELECTED THEY ACTUALLY VOTED TO HAVE A NEW. POSITION IN THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER YEAH. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT BUT I JUST MAKE ONE OTHER COMMENT ABOUT THIS. PET INOTES A SENSITIVE POINT BUT ANOTHER REASON FOR ELIMINATING THE OFFICE IN MY VIEW IS THE NATURE OF HOW WE CAMPAIGN FOR OFFICES CHANGE THIS USED TO BE. A SLEEPY OFFICE IT WAS DOMINATED BY PEOPLE WHO WERE EDUCATIONAL PROFESSIONALS. BUT IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. BECAUSE OF EDUCATION'S GROWING PROMINENCE. IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE. AND BECAUSE OF THE COST OF TELEVISION ADS AND RUNNING FOR THIS OFFICE THE OFFICES BECOME ONE THAT ONE ONLY RUN THIS IF YOU'RE. ABLE TO RAISE FIVE TO TWENTY OR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT MEANS THAT UNLESS YOU ARE A PRACTICING POLITICIAN OR INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY OR. APPOSITE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTE LARGE SUMS TO THESE ARE. IN PAINS YOUR OF YOUR CAR NOT ELIGIBLE TO RUN FOR THE OFFICE OF WORRY UNITE ELIGIBLE. BECAUSE HER. OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU KNOW DICTATES THE PROCESS SO. I'M A BIG FAN OF PUBLIC FINANCE REFORM IN UNTIL WE GET THAT KIND OF REFORM I THINK. OFFICES LIKE THIS. ARE YOU KNOW. SOMEWHAT EARNED. YOU DON'T CHALLENGED IN TERMS OF HAVING THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD AT LEAST LIKE TO CONSIDER RUNNING FOR THIS OFFICE. BECAUSE THREE PER PREREQUISITE IS ONE THAT OF THE YOU KNOW THEY CAN MEET. I AM AND WHAT I DO WANT TO GET INTO A DEBATE HERE BUT. THEY HAVE AND SAID YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO HAS A SINGLE MINDED FOCUS. ON DOING THIS JOB. AND I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I THINK RUNNING FOR THE OFFICE IN TERMS OF THE FUNDRAISING ASPECTS OF IT. REALLY GET IN THE WAY OF HEAVY THAT SINGLE MINDED FOCUS AND HAVING SOMEONE WHO WAS APPOINTED. BY SOMEONE WHO HAS TO RESOLVE THE MONEY THE GOVERNOR WHO IS REALLY FOR ABLE TO FOCUS ON THAT AND NOT WORRY. ABOUT THE NEXT ELECTION AND ABOUT ALL THE PUBLICITY THAT YOU NEED TO GET. TO. THE FREE PUBLICITY IN ADDITION TO THE PAY PUBLICITY IT REALLY I THINK GETS IN THE WAY OF HAVING THAT SINGLE MINDED FOCUS THAT I THINK THE. OF THE PERSON IN CHARGE EDUCATION THE CITY CALIFORNIA OUGHT TO HAVE REDUCE DOES THE CONTENTS FOR BOTH OF AND GOT RATHER ELEGANTLY ADDRESS THE TWO THINGS YOU JUST RAISE ONE THE ONE HAND AND. DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE VOTERS WOULD WANT TO GET RID OF A ELECTED POSITION. YOU KNOW SO KEEP THE POSITION GIVE IT MORE OF AN ADVOCACY ROLE IN TERMS OF MEMBERS OF CITIES VERY SPORTS A COMMISSION SIMILAR POWERS. BUT ULTIMATELY. PUT AN APPOINTED. PERSON I HAD IN CHARGE OF THE CD WHO IS SINGULARLY FOCUSED AND NOT AS POLITICALLY ORIENTED. I MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO DO MAKE THE BEST OF THE OF THE POLITICAL REALITIES IN THE STRUCTURES BUT ALSO THE. SORT OF IMPERATIVES YOU'RE DESCRIBING. I IN THE WAY THAT HE'S CRAFTED THIS PROPOSAL. I I THINK THAT THAT MAY BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT. YOU KNOW DIRECTION I MEAN ALL OF THESE MOST RECENT STUDIES HAVE NOT GONE THE ROUTE OF TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE OFFICE BECAUSE I THINK THEY FEEL THAT IT CAN'T BE ELIMINATED SO TO TRY TO RESTRUCTURE THE OFFICE AND CAREFULLY DEFINED. WHAT WHAT IT IS AND A TWO MINUTE LONG THAT IT'S? ROLE ARM OR EXPAND ITS ROLE IN ADVOCACY AS MISTER STARR WOULD WOULD YOU KNOW PUT FORWARD. MAYBE THAT WILL WORK I WORRY A LITTLE BIT THAT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED. A TRYING TO. MANAGING CONFINED THERE OF AUTHORITY IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT OF AN ISSUE BECAUSE OF THEIR YOU KNOW INDEPENDENCE HAS BEEN SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN ELECTED BY THE BY THE PEOPLE THAT. COULD IT A LITTLE MORE OF BOLDLY CAN YOU BE A LITTLE BIT PREGNANT. IS. NO ONE WHERE I THINK OF. BUT YOU HAVE TO SORT OF WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU TRY TO RESTRUCTURE THE OFFICE. I AM I IF AYE MAMMOTH AYE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THE AND LAST THREE SUPERINTENDENTS HAVE BEEN TEACHER. AND HAVE COME UP THROUGH THAT SYSTEM AND THAT WERE INVOLVED WHEN THEY WERE LEGISLATORS IN THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE PROCESS AND SO. AND WE'RE WELL STEEP A SUFFICIENTLY FOCUSED. I'M I MYSELF AM ALSO AN ADVOCATE OF PUBLIC FINANCING NAM A OF CAMPAIGNS AND THINK THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING. NAM A FIGURE APPROACH WAS NOT TO FOR DEBATE TODAY. WELL I I AM I REALLY. APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT IN AND DOWN AYE I THINK WILL I'M PECAN ON YOU. IN THE FUTURE AND AND VARIOUS VARIOUS THINGS IT'S CERTAINLY IF THAT THERE'S MOVEMENT ON THIS ISSUE. TO HELP US CONCEPTUALIZING THINK ABOUT THE WAY WE OUGHTA. HOBBY RESTRUCTURING. THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM FOR THE STATE MOVING FORWARD SO. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT AND TEMPERATURE YOUR YOUR. INCREDIBLE CONTINUED CONTINUED SERVICE OF THE STATE. AND WITH THAT I LOVE TO NOW CALL UP OUR NEXT PANEL. WHICH WILL PROVIDE US WITH A NUMBER OF PERSPECTIVES FROM ALL ACROSS THE. EDUCATIONAL POLITICAL SPECTRUM RISE. WE'VE GOT FOLKS FROM THE T. DISSOCIATION FROM. ACCESS THEIR ADMINISTRATORS SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION CHILDREN OUT PUBLIC ADVOCATES FIRST HOW CALIFORNIA THE CHARTER SCHOOLS IT'S QUITE A. QUITE A. A GOOD NEXT SO I'M. SO WHEN WHEN WE HAVE EVERYBODY HERE I KNOW THAT. CARLOS ASKED TO LEAVE BY LEN FORTY FIVE SO. DID YOU WANT TO PRESENT FIRST. PRESENT OKAY. AND WE'RE ASKING EVERYONE JUST IN THE JUST A TIME TO KEEP YOUR PRESENTATIONS BRIEF BUT I KNOW WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY SMART SHARP FOLKS ARE ON THE TABLE AND WE'RE VERY DISTANT. YOUR PERSPECTIVES. ARMS WILL START WITH YOU BECAUSE MARKETS GOVERNMENT TERMS COSTS ASSOCIATION AND THEN. I WOULD THEN TURN TO TONY. PATTY GHETTO FROM. CTA. GREAT APPLE THANK YOU SO MUCH. AT. FOR TAKING THE TIME THAT TO DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I'M THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THAT CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION. AND I JUST WANNA THANK AYE CHAIR ALLEN AND O'DONNELL IN PARTICULAR. FOR ADD YOU KNOW TAKING THE TIME AND CARE TO REVISIT FOR STUDY DATA GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE UNDER WHICH CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. IS ORGANIZED AND ADMINISTERED AB CDSA AS YOU MAY KNOW WORKS REGULARLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS TO WHICH CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE GRANTED UNDER THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT. ARE EXHAUSTED AT THE STATE LEVEL ON APPEAL WHEN. THOSE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN DENIED BY THEIR DISTRICTS AND COUNTY BOARDS OF EDUCATION. AND WHY WE ARE PREPARED TO OFFER AN OPINION AT THIS TIME ABOUT THE VARIOUS RESTRUCTURE PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU. IT'S IMPORTANT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT THE STATE BOARDS CHARTERING AUTHORITY IN ITS CAPACITY TO AUTHORIZED CHARTER SCHOOLS. IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BROADER DEBATE. I IN ADDITION TO ITS POLICY MAKING POWERS THE STATE BOARD IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE. OUT FOR THE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION OF HEARING AND APPROVING OR DENYING CHARTER SCHOOL APPEALS. THE STATE BOARD AS IT CURRENTLY IS RESOURCE AND STRUCTURED BY THE ADMISSION OF SEVERAL SITTING STATE BOARD MEMBERS. IS STRAINED TO EXECUTE BOTH ITS POLICY MAKING AND IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE CHARTERING. AND TO BE CLEAR THIS STATE BOARD AND THIS CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; HAVE</u> WELL TOGETHER. UNDER THE BROWN AND TORE LOOKS IN ADMINISTRATIONS. AND HAVE ESTABLISH HEALTHY AND QUALITY AUTHORIZING AN OVERSIGHT PRACTICES. AS WELL AS MODELED QUALITY AND DISPASSIONATE PETITION REVIEW STANDARDS FOR ALL OFF THE RISERS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT NOT UNLIKE DISTRICT AND COUNTY AUTHORIZE YEARS WHO ARE EQUALLY STRAINED BY THE COMPETING DUTIES OF BOTH POLICY MAKING. AND CHARTERING THE CARE AND ATTENTION THAT THE LATTER RECEIVES OFTEN HINGES ARM ON BE ADMINISTRATION AND THE BOARD EMPOWER AT THE GIVEN TIME. SO IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BROADER DISCUSSION AND WE WOULD INVITE YOU TO REIMAGINE HOW CHARTER SCHOOLS ACCESS THEIR APPEAL RIGHTS AND ARE AUTHORIZED AT THE STATE LEVEL. KEEPING THE STATE'S BOARDS FOCUS ON POLICY MAKING FOR THE ENTIRE CAVE TWO THROUGH TWELVE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM WHILE MIGRATING MUCH OF THE BOARD'S CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE CHARTERING DUTIES TO AN ALTERNATIVE. AND MORE DISCREET. ENTITY LIKE THE ADVISORY COMMISSION ON CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD FREE UP THE BOARDS RESOURCES AND ATTENTION TO ENTIRELY FOCUS ON POLICY MAKING. WHILE I ALLOWING ENTITIES LIKE THE A CCS WHICH STILL FALL WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF HOW CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. IS ORGANIZED WILL ENSURE THAT ONE ENTITY HAS THE CAPACITY TO FULLY FOCUS ON QUALITY AUTHORIZING. THIS CHANGE MAY BE POSSIBLE BY AN ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE OR ON A MORE LIMITED BASIS IF THE STATE BOARD WERE TO GRANT THE ACCS GREATER AUTHORITY OVER CHARTERING. WHILE MAINTAINING AUTHORITY TO INTERVENE IN ACCS IS FINAL DETERMINATIONS IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. SO AS YOU DISCUSSED THE WISDOM OF RETAINING THE CURRENT SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE K. THROUGH TWELVE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OR. REALIGNING UNDER A DIFFERENT MODEL WE DO ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THOSE PROPOSALS MAY PRESENT ARE RELATED TO THE MANNER IN WHICH CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE AUTHORIZED AT THE STATE LEVEL. YOU DID YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR THERE'S A. YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE THEIR TO BE SEPARATE. AUTHORIZING BOARD IS THAT. SO I WE MUST HAVE THEIR SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE CURRENTLY IN PLACE THAT WE THINK. EITHER THROUGH THAT BY AUTHORITY THAT WOULD BE. GRANTED BY THE STATE BOARD TO THE A CCS PCCS COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE A GREATER ROLE OVER. THE AUTHORIZING DUTIES OF THE STATE BOARD ABOVE AND BEYOND JUST BEING. AN ADVISER TO. TO THE STATE BOARD OR AN ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD MIGRATE DOES AUTHORIZING DUTIES ENTIRELY TO THE ACC ES. OKAY CZS IT REVIEWS WITHIN ITS THE ADVISORY COMMISSION ON CHARTER SCHOOLS AND AT THIS TIME THEY. THEY MEET BEFORE. EACH STATE BOARD MEETING QUARTERLY AND MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHETHER. CHARTER SCHOOL SHOULD BE APPROVED OR DENIED. AND THEY. THEY ARE. PROVIDED AT SOME ADDITIONAL PATENT EVIDENCE AND AND ABOUT PETITION REVIEW SUPPORT FROM CITY STAFF. CURRENT THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH I'VE IF YOU COULD SHARE YOUR TESTIMONY WITH THE. WITH US I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. I'M OKAY GREAT MOVE WILL NEXT YEAR FROM TONY TO GET. FROM. THIS COMFORTED ASSOCIATION. MISTER CHAIR STAFF. TONY TRIGGER ON BEHALF THAT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY AS A HISTORY MAJOR I'VE ENJOYED THE US CENTRAL DOWN MEMORY LANE. REFLECTED IN THE STUDIES I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH ALL THE CHARACTERIZATION. STUDIES BUT. HERE WE ARE. WE SUPPORT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE NONPARTISAN ELECTED SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CARRYING OUT THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT WE BELIEVE THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. SERVICES IT CHECKS AND BALANCES BETWEEN THE BERRIES AND. WE HAVE FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN THE OVERSIGHT AND THE BUDGETARY INFLUENCE THE LEGISLATURE PERFORMS IN THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION. CTA THAT'S REFLECTED IN OUR INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL POLICY WRITTEN IN ADOPTED BY OUR ELECTED MEMBERS. AT THE STATE COUNCIL EDUCATION. CTA WE HAVE POLICY CTA PER THEIR BELIEVES THAT THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION POSITION. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SHOULD BE ELIMINATED AND ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THIS OFFICE BE ASSUMED BY THE CALIFORNIA TO. IN OF EDUCATION. REGARDING TIMING WE THINK THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. WE APPRECIATE THE. PRESENTATION WE. BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE INPUT FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND IT CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE SHORT TIME LEFT IN THIS TWO ADMINISTRATIONS. WE DO WELCOME BEING PART OF THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU PRESSURE. ARE OKAY WILL NEXT HEAR FROM OUR PRESTON FROM ACCESS FROM. OUR CITIES GOVERNMENT SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS. FOR INVITING US TO BE HERE OF I HAVE TO RESPOND IN A GETS BECAUSE A LOT OF US WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE AND MAYBE LONGER THAN WE WANT TO ADMIT. A. IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WHEN THE MASTER PLAN CAME OUT WE I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THROUGH OUR ARCHIVES AND FIND WHAT WE SAID AT THE TIME. I MANY HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY TOOK TIME WE CREATED A COVER. FORCE WITHIN ACSA I'M TO LOOK AT ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND. EITHER ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE SUGGESTED TO A COUPLE PEOPLE RECENTLY IS THE LONGER YOU'RE ON THIS PLANET YOU REALIZE THERE ARE NOT A WHOLE LOT OF NEW IDEAS THEY JUST SORT OF KEEP. RESURFACING IN SOME SORT OF ITERATION AS WE THINK THIS IS. IT FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY. I AM DO WE WHERE WE WERE AT THE TIME AND WE STILL CONTINUE TO BE IS WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE ELECTED S. P. I THAT THAT IS. A LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC. AND BUT LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY TODAY I WAS KIND OF FUN. WE'VE LOOKING AND THINKING ABOUT OTHER IDEAS AND ONE OF THE THOUGHTS I HAD IS. AND REALLY MOVING FORWARD IS THE FACT THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CONTINUITY I'M WHERE WE HAD THE LEAST ABOUT CONTINUITY IS WHEN WE THROUGH WENT DIFFERENT CHANGES WHEN WE HAD THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. AND SENATOR HART WAS AN AMAZING SECRETARY AT THE TIME BOTTOM THAT'S WHERE MY MEMBERS BUT THROUGH HAD A LOT OF CONFUSION BECAUSE NOW YOU HAD THIS THIRD PERSON THAT WAS KIND OF. IN AND OUT OF CREATING POLICY I THINK THAT THE THIS FIELD FEELS THE WAY IT WORKS NOW IS FINE. AND I THINK THAT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY TO BE HONEST THE CAPABILITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I'M IT IS A LONG WAY FROM A DISTRICT TO THE STATE TO WHETHER IT'S THE STATE BOARD WEATHERS THE LEGISLATURE. SO KEEPING THAT IN IN MIND IS WHERE WE REALLY POINT OF VALUE THE THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT IS WITH REACHING OUT TO. OUR LOCALS UP AND I THINK HAVING A STATE ELECTED S. P. AYE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT WE WORRY ABOUT IT HERE A LOT MORE THAN I THINK THE PEOPLE ON THE FIELD REALLY WORRY ABOUT. WITHOUT THINKING. FROM WHICH ROOM. I APPRECIATE THAT. NEXT WE HEAR FROM TERRY BURNS IN THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. AND IT LARA'S RIGHT SOME OF US HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR QUITE AWHILE AND HAVE BEEN THROUGH. DAYS BACK WHEN THE HOENIG DECISION JUST CAME OUT. AND. WE WERE ALL KIND OF IN A DIFFERENT PLACE FIGURING OUT WHAT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WERE AND HOW THINGS CHANGED NOW. AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED OVERTIME. WE'RE WE'RE IN A PLACE WHERE WE GET HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. ON MISTER PAYNE WAS RIGHT YOU CAN'T ARE. LEGISLATE RELATIONSHIPS ON HEALTH FOLKS GET ALONG AND WORK TOGETHER. BUT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. EVEN IF WE HAVE. GOVERNOR NSP AYE WHO ARE IN ALIGNMENT WILL HAVE A LEGISLATURE WHO IS. SIMILARLY ALIGNMENT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THOSE CONFLICTS. WE'RE JUST NOT FEELING THAT NEEDS TO SEE A MASSIVE CHANGE HERE RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A TIME OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN EDUCATION WE'RE CHANGING THE ASSESSMENTS. WE ARE CHANGING THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WE'RE CHANGING THE FUNDING SYSTEM WE'RE CHANGING THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. WORD PLACE WE THINK THIS IS KIND OF A DISTRACTION FROM THAT. OUT WITHOUT A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FOR IT. WE ARE LOOKING AT LOCAL CONTROL AND MR DONALD'S RIGHT PEOPLE AREN'T GOING. TO THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY MY KID IS NOT LEARNING THEIR COMING TO ME AT THE SCHOOL BOARD AND SAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING. AND. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. IT IT. THE AT. THE IDEA OF A LONE VOICE. CRYING OUT IN THE WILDERNESS SEEMS TO BE THIS PROPOSAL. WITH THIS S. B. I HE WAS ELECTED WHO SITS AS ONE MEMBER OF MANY OF THESE BODIES. WHO? IS ONE VOTE OF MANY. WHO DOESN'T HAVE POWER TO STAND BEHIND OUR BACK UP THOSE POSITIONS? IS PROBLEMATIC TO US WE THINK THAT AND SPI NEEDS TO HAVE. SOME. SOME GREATER ROLE IN SOME GREATER FUNCTION THAN SIMPLY. A A BULLY PULPIT WHO NAM IS JUST CRYING AND WENT. OKAY I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP ON THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND I'M THRILLED THE TREND FROM CHILDREN NOW. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THAT SPECIFIC SCOPE OF THE ENTITIES. AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER WE THINK IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THAT SAID AND ALONG THE LINES OF THE OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY MEMBERS IN AND VARIOUS PANELISTS. CHILL NOW BELIEVES THE BEFORE WE START TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURES IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE FIRST IDENTIFYING CLARIFY WHAT THE STATE'S FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENT IS GOING TO BE. TO KIDS AND FAMILIES AND THE BROADER. ADULTS WHO PARTICIPATE EACH OF THE. OF WHAT THE STATE'S ROLE IS IT AND FUNDAMENTAL IN. WHAT COMMITMENTS ARE WE GONNA MAKE TO THOSE CHILDREN AND WHAT IS THE STATE'S ROLE AS THE GUARANTOR OF THOSE COMMITMENTS? UP ONCE WE HAVE CLARITY ON THAT FRONT AND THEN HOW THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES MIGHT BEST BE ORGANIZED CAN FLOW FROM THAT. UNFORTUNATELY WITHIN AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FROM EQUITY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT'S OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS THAT SUFFER WHEN ADULTS DON'T HAVE CLARITY OR THE CAPACITY TO. ACTUALLY DELIVER ON A HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION. A SO WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS AS THEY CURRENTLY STAND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE EARLY LEARNING SECTOR. IT IS PROBABLY THEM THE MOST CHALLENGED IN TERMS OF WHAT THE FUNDAMENTAL STATE ROLE IS. AND YET WE KNOW WITH THE RECENT BRAIN RESEARCH AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES THAT THIS IS WHERE WE CAN HAVE THE MOST. PROFOUND IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM IMPACT. I THINK IF WE HAD THI INFORMATION MANY YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE CREATING OUR PUBLICS. SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION WE WOULD HAVE MADE SURE THAT WE WERE STARTING MUCH YOUNGER AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY ONLY FOURTEEN PERCENT OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS THAT ARE EVEN DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR. SUPPORT. IN THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM GET ACCESS TO IT. WE KNOW THAT HIGH QUALITY INFANT CARE COST AS MUCH PER YEAR. ACTION MORE THAN THE USE YOU SEE TUITION AND OUR. APPROACH TO THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS IS A PATCHWORK WHERE THERE'S NO ONE ENTITY THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR QUALITY ACCESS AND OR AFFORDABILITY. I'M ALL OF THESE OUTCOMES ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF THE FACT THAT THE STATE IS NOT FULLY CLARIFIED WHAT IT WILL OR WON'T PROVIDE TO KIDS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT BASED ON THE RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT THAT THE STATE HAS TO. MAKE SURE THAT ALL CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE THE GUARANTOR. TO ENSURE ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS HAVE ACCESS THAT CHILDREN ACROSS I ECS OF IT WHAT IS THE STATE GOING TO HOLD ON TO AND WHAT IS IT GOING TO DELEGATE AND WE BELIEVE THERE AT LEAST FIVE AREAS WHERE THE STATE. NEEDS TO STEP UP AND PROVIDE EVEN MORE. SUPPORT ENGAGEMENT AND THAT INCLUDES ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH WAS I REFERENCED A LOT TODAY FISCAL TRANSPARENCY DATA SUPPORT AND. FUNDING AND ON THE THE ACCOUNTABILITY FRONT CALIFORNIA HAS MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF RELEASING A NEW STATE DASHBOARD WHICH WE BELIEVE IS THE RIGHT OVER ARCHING APPROACH HAS MULTIPLE MEASURES SIMS ONLINE FOR FUNCTION ABILITY. WHICH IS REALLY GREAT. BUT THERE ARE SOME KEY AREAS THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO REALLY ENGAGE IN AND FOCUS ON. AND AND AND POTENTIALLY. ENGAGE IN. LEGISLATIVELY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND THAT IS. DOES THE DOCTOR FOR AN ENOUGH INFORMATION ON WHETHER OR NOT GAPS IN ACHIEVEMENT OR CLOSING. DO WE HAVE ENOUGH INDICATORS IN THE SYSTEM A SPECIAL AROUND COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ARTICULATION BETWEEN K. TWELVE AND HIGHER ED. PARENT TEACHER. STUDENT SURVEYS AND A GROWTH MEASURE SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE ROLES IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY SPACE THAT WE THINK IS ICAL. ON IN TERMS OF FISCAL TRANSPARENCY THE STATE SHOULD BE UP ANSWER SOME FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS AND ESSENTIALLY. DID WE PROVIDE INCREASED IMPROVE SERVICES A SYSTEMATIC LEVEL FOR OUR LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOSTER YOUTH AND WAS THAT UP IN ABOVE. THE. AVERAGE. SUPPORTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR FOR ALL KIDS. AND IN ADDITION ON DATA. IT'S CALIFORNIA'S WOEFULLY BEHIND THE REST THE NATION IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW THE SYSTEMS THAT WE USE TO ALLOW POLICY MAKERS EDUCATORS. AND THE PUBLIC TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW SCHOOLS ARE DOING AND HOW STUDENTS ARE DOING AND THAT'S IMPACTING INSTRUCTION AND THAT'S AN AREA WE CAN IMPROVE. ON SUPPORT ANOTHER AREA THAT'S GONNA BE A BIG. THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION THIS YEAR AND AND AGAIN WHERE THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY. IN ENSURING THAT WERE PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SUPPORTS THE OVERARCHING VISION THAT'S WHY I'M ROLLING OUT IS IS THE RIGHT ONE. AND WE NEED TO DO. WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN EVERY SCHOOL REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE ZIP CODE IS. SHE HAS ACCESS TO THAT SUPPORT A FAMILY ON FINDING I THINK YOU ALL. WE WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE KNOW THAT I CALIFORNIA. INVEST LESS BEEN BEEN OTHER NATIONS ARE OTHER STATES. WHILE WE HAVE THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY A IN TERMS OF PRE PER PER PUPIL SPENDING WERE ABOUT FORTY FIRST AND I THINK THAT THE RECENT ESTIMATE LAST ESTIMATES. AND THIS RESULTS IN KIDS HAVING LIKE LESS ACCESS TO ADULTS AND WE HAVE AMONG THE HIGHEST RATIOS OF. IF NOT THE HIGHEST RATIO OF TEA OF STUDENTS PER TEACHER ADMINISTRATOR COUNSELOR LIBRARIAN AND. EACH OF THESE FIVE AREAS OF OF. ACCOUNTABILITY FISCAL TRANSPARENCY DATA SUPPORT AND FUNDING ARE CRITICAL RULES FOR THE STATE AND AS WE THINK ABOUT STRUCTURES. THOSE STRUCTURES AGAIN NEED TO FLOW FROM WHAT THOSE FUNDAMENTAL ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMMITMENTS ARE OUR TWO CHILDREN I'M INFERRING THAT JUST WANNA MENTION HIGHER IT REALLY QUICKLY. THAT WE'VE WE'VE OF ASYLUM WING OF THE THREE PUBLIC. SEGMENTS CREATES A DYNAMIC WERE NO SINGLE. IS FOCUSED ON A RESPONSIBLE. FOR HOW THE BEST INTEREST OF STUDENTS BOTH WITHIN AND ACROSS THE SEGMENTS BUT AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER SEPAK ó WAS WHAT'S CONCEDE TO DO THIS BUT IT NEVER HAVE THE AUTHORITY. OR THE RESOURCES AND CAPACITY TO REALLY CARRY OUT THAT CHARGE AND WE BELIEVE AT THIS COORDINATING FUNCTION SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT THE STATE LEVEL. AND THAT AS WE DO THAT THAT WE'RE DEFINING SUCCESS IS MORE THAN JUST KIDS GETTING INTO COLLEGE BUT THAT THERE ULTIMATELY SIX SCHOOL IN WHATEVER PATH AND THEY TAKE. AND IN THE MINIMUM THE STATE SHOULD CLEARLY ARTICULATE THE EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH OF THE SEGMENTS OF HIGHER ED BEYOND JUST WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET ACT. AND A LINE THOSE TO KEY TWELVE OUTCOMES AND THAT THE STATE'S COMMITMENT. CLARIFY WHAT ITS COMMITMENT WILL BE TO ENSURE THE SCHOOLS ARE CAN BE ACHIEVED. SO IN CLOSING IN AND REFLECTING ON THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES THAT THAT MIGHT BE MOVED IN AND REORGANIZE AT THE STATE LEVEL AGAIN A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION TO HAVE. BUT WE HOPE THAT AS A CONVERSATIONS OCCURRING IT IS TRULY GROUNDED IN WHAT IS THE STATE'S ROLE AND ALSO A COMMITMENT SO THAT THE KIDS THE FAMILIES AND. THE EDUCATORS THAT ARE PART OF IT THINGS ARE MUCH OF NOT NOT. OKAY THANK YOU. I WILL NEXT YEAR FROM. BUT I DON'T RIGEL RIGEL MASATO PARA FROM PUBLIC ADVOCATES. I WAS THE NAME FROM. A STAR. OPEN A SOLUTION BRIAN. BELL MEANS LEG FOOD AND RECONSIDER ITS O'BRIEN'S LEFT LIKE IT'S IT'S UNNERVING OKAY PROTESTED. THE A GRANDFATHER LIKE LOOKING AT THE STARS IT. CHAIRED ANNOUNCER ALAN STAFF THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE THIS MORNING PUBLIC ADVOCATES HAS ADVOCATED A AND LITIGATED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. AND IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND PARENTS IN CALIFORNIA OR FORTY YEARS. FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW. PROVIDING STATEWIDE KEY TWELVE EDUCATION GOVERNANCE AYE YOU WHILE IT IS ADMITTEDLY FLAWED IS BASICALLY WORKING AND WE HAVE EXHIBIT A AS AS A LOT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPER FORMS. THAT WE'VE SEEN. HAD THAT THE DEPARTMENT THE BOARD THE LEGISLATURE BILLY GRAPPLE WITH IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. WHILE IT IS NOT PERFECTLY WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THE UNIQUE ROLE THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION HOUSES THE ESSENTIALLY THE THE PRIMARY AFFIRMATIVE BENEFIT. AND ARE UNDER STATES CONSTITUTION HASN'T IT TAKES UP MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF OUR STATE'S BUDGET IT'S A BIGGER AND MORE COMPLICATED SUCH. AND MOST OTHER FUNCTIONS OF OUR GOVERNMENT. WE ALSO NOTE THAT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN FOR THIS IMPORTANT HAVE A SEAT A SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE GOVERNOR. AND THE COURTS HAVE BASICALLY WORKED OUT THE POLICY VERSUS IMPLEMENTATION BACK. AGAIN NOT PERFECT. WE ADMIT THEIR TENSIONS AMBIGUITIES IN THE SYSTEM AND WE. SEE THAT CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS COULD BE MADE WE WE MIGHT SUGGEST A NONPARTISAN BUDGET SETTING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO INCREASE ITS CAPACITY TO MEET ITS LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. AND ANOTHER IDEA MIGHT BE TO GIVE THE BOARD A FINALIST ALREADY IN THE REGULATION IN THE IMPLEMENTING THE REGULATIONS IT PROMULGATES. APART FROM THESE ISSUES TIME WE AYE I WANT TO ECHO AND MISS TRANSIENT ANNOUNCED COMMENT ABOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING THAT IS IN OUR VIEW THE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FACING QUALITY OF EDUCATION THAT OUR KIDS RECEIVE IN THE STATE. AND APART FROM THAT WE WE REALLY WANT TO ARTICULATE OUR OUR DESIRE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY. OF LOCAL ELEAZAR DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR EDUCATION UNDER LCF STAFF. AS WAS STATED WE AND WE AND WE STRONGLY AGREE THAT FAMILIES SEE THEIR LOCAL LEADERS. AS AS GOVERNESS IN IN IN CALIFORNIA DUCATION AND AND WHILE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S BUT THE WITH THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT STATES AND COUNTIES PLAYED. ARE OUR REFORMS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THEM THE LOCAL CONTROL AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS. HOLDING THEIR DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COUNTY OFFICES ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUTCOMES THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE. WE NEED YOUR HELP MAKE DEMOCRACY REAL AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. BECAUSE LOCAL BY AN ACCOUNTABILITY AND PUT ARE CRITICAL TO TRANSFORMING OUTCOMES FOR. UNDER LCF OUT STILL COME SCHOOL COMMUNITIES NOW HAVE MULTIPLE MEASURES OF SUCCESS IN THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. AND THE LOCAL CONTROL THEY NEED TO FACE THEIR UNIQUE CHALLENGES WE HAVE ANY STATE AGENCY IN NYC AND THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE WE HAVE A COUNTY OFFICES. TO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE OF PROVIDING DESPERATELY NEEDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO DISTRICTS. I CHARTER SCHOOLS AS THEY STRIVE TO CREATE EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS. WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE THE SYSTEM WORK AND WE THINK THAT ADEQUATE FISCAL RESOURCES AND OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE. IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY IS MATCHED BY LOCAL CAPACITY. WHEN IT'S WORKING WE THINK THE SYSTEM WILL EMPOWER COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY CHINESE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TWO WAY EN ON WHAT THEY NEED AND AND AND OBTAIN WITH THE NEED TO EXIT EXIT TO SUCCEED WHETHER IT'S PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. FOR TEACHERS TO ENGAGE IN PROJECT BASED LEARNING. POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS SYSTEMS SCHOOL COUNSELORS CULTURAL COMPETENCE TRAINING FOR ADMINISTRATORS. WE BELIEVE IN THE SYSTEM'S WORKING IT'S GONNA PROVIDE ROBUST RESEARCH BASED SUPPORT TO ELEAZAR. FROM THE COUNTY OFFICES CC TO MEET THE NEEDS. OF OUR SINCE IT DISABILITIES FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS HOMELESS STUDENTS. WE THINK ONE THE SYSTEM'S WORKING IT'S GOING TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS GENERATED BY HIGH NEED STUDENTS ARE SPENT EFFECTIVELY ON MORE AND BETTER SERVICES FOR THOSE STUDENTS. THAT TRANSPARENCY IS KEY TO LC EFFECTS EQUITY PROMISE. I. AND WE THINK THAT WHEN THE SYSTEM IS WORKING IT WILL AUTHENTICALLY MEASURE SKIP SCHOOL CLIMATE PARA ENGAGEMENT AND SOON ENGAGEMENT WHICH ARE TRULY THE FOUNDATIONS FOR STUDENT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. FOR THE SYSTEM TO ORK WE NEED CONTINUED RESOURCES TO SEE C. E. COUNTY OFFICES TO ENSURE ROBUST SYSTEM IS A. POR IS AVAILABLE TO ALL ELEAZAR. AND THAT TIME AND THAT ALL THE CC <u>&lt;c.green&gt; COUNTY OFFICES</u> DISTRICTS ARE ABLE TO STE TRULY SUPPORT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. ROBUST MEASURES OF CONFINEMENT AND ENGAGEMENT SHOULD INCLUDE ANNUAL SURVEY. EXCUSE ME SURVEYS OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND CAN AND WE KNOW FROM SPEAKING WITH WORKING WITH CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PRACTITIONERS. THAT THAT THAT THERE IS A CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY BY PARENTS AND STUDENTS AND IMPROVING OUR. THE CURRENT K. TWELVE EDUCATION GOVERNANCE IS NOT. POSING A THREAT TO OUR STATES PROMISING REFORMS% AND WHILE THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM TO IMPROVE ULTIMATELY WE HAVE MORE PRESSING NEEDS. TIME TO MAKE DEMOCRACY REALLY PUBLIC EDUCATION AND WE URGE LAWMAKERS. FOR AUTHENTIC COMMUNICATION. SO THAT DISTRICT DECISIONS MEET THE REAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THANK YOU. BUT YOU. WELL THANK EVERYBODY FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVES I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT OVERHEAD. ERIN. I'M SO SORRY TURNTABLE FROM FOR SUCH CALIFORNIA I'M SO SORRY. AARON GAVE ON BEHALF FIRST TYPE CALIFORNIA AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK AB BRIEFLY SO I WILL BE BRIEF INTERRUPTION IN GOVERNANCE OF THE ENTIRE. IF EDUCATION UNDER THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND WHAT IMPACT EARLY LEARNING IN CHILD CARE UNIQUELY TO ANY ISSUE. AND WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU BEGIN ANY THESE CONVERSATIONS AROUND GOVERNANCE WITH THINKING ABOUT HOW A GOVERNANCE CHANGE WOULD ELEVATE AND STRENGTHEN COHERENCE IN THE DELIVERY OF EARLY LEARNING IN OUR SYSTEM. RATHER THAN BURYING IT PERHAPS WITH ANOTHER INSTITUTION WHERE IT MIGHT BE A NEW ISSUE. IN THE SEVENTY FIVE YEAR HISTORY OF EASY E. IN CALIFORNIA SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY BY THE WAY. EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS CHILDCARE AND PRESCHOOL HAVE BEEN SOLELY UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE S. P. AYE UNLIKE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE IS NO BIFURCATION BETWEEN ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE STATE BOARD. AND TO STATE SUPERINTENDENT INCLUDING FOR CURRICULUM ACCOUNTABILITY AND WAIVERS OF STATE LAW. EASY IS UNIQUE IN THE CD E. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY. REPORTING SOLELY TO THE FBI FOR THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM OUT ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM THAT'S OUR VOUCHER BASED CHILDCARE. TITLE FIVE CENTER BASED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS PRESCHOOL AND CAL WORK STAGES TWO AND THREE. THE NATIONALLY ACCLAIMED PRESCHOOL LEARNING FOUNDATIONS SUCH AS OURS ZERO TO FIVE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK. AND THE SANDERS ARTICULATE TO THE COMMON CORE IS SOLELY UNDER THE NEED THE JURISDICTION CURRENTLY OF THE S. P. AYE* CONTRACT MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND HE SAID HE IS NOT A LOCAL CONTROL MODEL. AFTER MANY POLICY WARS ON THAT FRONT SOME OF THE RECENT. EASY HAS REMAINED A STATE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM AND A STATE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM UNDER THE FBI BECAUSE I'VE TO DATE HAS BEEN BELIEVED BY THE FEEL THAT IT'S BEEN THE BEST STATE AGENCY. OUGHT TO SUPPORT THE TWIN GOALS OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT WORKING TOWARDS ABORIGINE TREATMENT GAP AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES IN OUR DIVERSE SYSTEM. EASY IS ALSO NOT SOLELY ARE DELIVERED THROUGH OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS BUT RATHER IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. IT'S ALSO PARTIALLY FUNDED THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THESE KEY ADMINISTRATIVE PARTNER SAM HELP KEEP THE PROGRAM MOVING AND MANY DIVERSE DELIVERY ENVIRONMENTS AROUND OUR STATE. NEITHER OF NO DOUBT BEEN GREAT CHALLENGES FOR THE EASY COMMUNITY TO BE BURIED IN A K. TWELVE FOCUSED AGENCY. NOR HAS THIS LOCATION YET FULLY ACHIEVE THE PROMISE AB ARTICULATING PRE K. THROUGH QUE AND TWELVE INTO HIRE AT IS MANY OF OUR PARTNERS TO DISCUSS. BUT THIS AGENCY LOCATION AGAIN HAS ALWAYS HELD THE MOST PROMISE IN KEEPING CHILD DEVELOPMENT AS A NORTH STAR. AND CURRENTLY AS CERTAINLY LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION HAS BEEN MOST ARTICULATE ON THE SCHOOL. I COULD NOT RECOMMEND A MOVE TO EVEN MORE K. TWELVE FOCUSED AGENCY AS SADNESS BEEN SAID BY MANY OF OUR PANELISTS HERE. ESPECIALLY ONE FACING OUR CURRENT TSUNAMI OF CALIFORNIA EDUCATION REFORMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED VERY SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AND SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH HAS BEEN PLACED IN THE LAPS OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION MEMBERS. LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMON CORE NEW ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS JUST TO NAME A FEW SMALL THINGS. HAS BEEN RECOMMENDEDBY NUMEROUS REFORM BRIEFS OVER THE DECADES ANY SHIFTING GOVERNANCE FOR UC'S SHOULD BE FOR THE SAKE OF ELEVATING E. C. E. AND FINDING SOME CLARITY AND SOME CONTINUITY. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND FROM THE INTENT TO PROVIDE A MORE EFFECTIVE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM FOR EASY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE COMMITTEES LOOK INTO THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE BRIEF THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR PACKETS. AS I WELL AS THE HIGH COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION RIGHT START COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN A COMPREHENSIVELY. I HAVE SOME OF SUGGESTED THAT YOU SEE. I'M. THAT ONE EARLY CHILDHOOD AGENCY WHETHER BE THE CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE AGENCY ROLES AT CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; OR&lt;/c&gt;</u> CONSOLIDATIONS OF PROGRAMS AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN SOME OTHER WAY. I'M BUT REGARDLESS OF THE MODEL ALL RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE ELEVATED AND ATTEMPTED TO COORDINATE IN SOME WAY EASY PROGRAMS. AND. ADDITIONALLY TO TRY TO FIND SOME WAY TRANSITION TO CAPE TWELVE AND THINK MORE SYSTEMATICALLY ACROSS THE SYSTEMS. REGARDLESS OF THE AGENCY REAL ESTATE PLEASE SEIZE THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO ARTICULATE A SENSIBLE SYSTEM FOR EASY TO BRING OUR DIVERSE FUNDING SYSTEMS TOGETHER. INTO A REAL SYSTEM FOR THE FIRST TIME AND AS YOU'LL SEE INCLUDED IN THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE BRIEF AB FOR THINGS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. ONE A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY NO WRONG DOOR PORTAL PREPARED ENROLLMENT IN REFERRAL TO QUALITY CHILDCARE INFORMED PARENT CHOICE WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT CHILDCARE VOUCHERS OR TEA QUE. NUMBER TO A SINGLE SYSTEM FOR FUNDING RATES PER CHILD THAT RECOGNIZE THE COST OF QUALITY IN BOTH OUR SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS. A SINGLE SYSTEM FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL OF OUR TEACHERS AND ALL CARE SETTINGS. AND FINALLY TO FIND A WAY TO CONSOLIDATE OR QUOTE WORD NEED OUR ECT STATE SYSTEM ROLES IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE BUT NOT NECESSARILY UNDERNEATH THE STATE BOARD. I THINK YOU. WHICH REMINDS. I'M OKAY. DO WE HAVE SO WHEN WE PUT THE FOLKS STAY HERE FOR JUST ONE QUICK SECOND AS THE AS AN ANALYST BECOME PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE THE COMMENT OKAY. LET'S HEAR FROM YOU. LAST COUPLE QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL ON WILL BELLIGERENT YES. GOOD MORNING SUE BANG ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. TOM TRUCKS AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ON QUE TALK GOVERNANCE BUT ONE OF THE CLEAR THAT SUPPORT HIM TORRANCE AND DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE COMMONSENSE PROPOSED SO. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE OF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES SIR. GOOD MORNING CREATURE MIRACLE FOR THE ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEAD START ASSOCIATION ADDS WINNER REINFORCED THAT THE COMMENTS THAT AARON MADE ABOUT THE EARLY CHILDHOOD AT WORLD. I'M. I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ENSURE THAT. GOOD GOVERNANCE CREATES A PLACE. WHERE ARE THE EARLY CHILDHOOD WORLD HAS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE IN THAT GOVERNMENT'S TABLE THAT IS COMMENSURATE WITH OUR ITS IMPORTANCE IT IS BORNE OUT BY THE RESEARCH ON INVESTMENTS IN THE BENEFITS OF THE INVESTMENTS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD? AS A PART OF THAT IS GOING TO SAY I YOU KNOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX HEADS FOR AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA MANY OF THEM ON THE STEEP PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND. AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN THE JOB I CAN TELL YOU I I I BELIEVE THAT. HEAD START IS ALMOST A SHADOW ECONOMY HERE. BY AND DOESN'T ALWAYS GET THE ATTENTION THAT IT DESERVES WHEN THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND EARLY CHILDHOOD. OUT FUNDING AND SLOTS AN ACCESS OR DISCUSSED. I IT'S A BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE GOVERNANCE. OF EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN AND FOR OUR YOUNGEST MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. THAT JUST ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS. THE CAPACITY TO COLLABORATE THIS VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM OF DELIVERY AND OVERSIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW LEVINE IS AT A DID SO I UNDERSTAND AND MAYBE I MISSED IT BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT. HOW DOES THAT? ON WHAT WHY WITH DID THE CONTENTS FOR BOTH UNNECESSARILY. LEAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD. PART OF THIS THAT OF THE LOOP I THINK THE CONTEXT WE'VE LOOKED AT IF YOU THINK ABOUT TODAY'S HEARING AND HOW. WITH BARELY EVEN IF THE SKIM THE SURFACE AND THE HOURS WE SPEND TODAY ON EACH OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES FACING KEY TWELVE EDUCATION. IN THE NEW FAST FORWARD TO A TWO DAY LONG STATE BOARD HEARING THAT ALREADY IS THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED IN EXCESS HOW IT HOW CRITICAL ISSUE LIKE EASE THE E. WOULD ACTUALLY BE ELEVATED. IN A CONTEXT RATHER THAN BE BURIED IS SOMETHING WE ARE GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING THE WONDERFUL EXTREME THINGS OF THE STATE BOARDS GRAPPLING WITH VERY WELL RIGHT NOW. IN TERMS OF SEVEN YEARS OF SIGNIFICANT EDUCATION REFORM IT'S HAPPENED. RIVER ARGUABLY HE'S SEEKING TO HOWARD THE BOARD FURTHER. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I MADE THERE ARE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF THE APPOINTMENTS THAT ARE MADE IN TERMS OF VALUED AT THINK YOU TALK ABOUT THIS WITH THE EARLIER PANEL. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO THE PROPOSALS BUT AS IT'S BEEN MADE IT WITH A BALANCED APPOINTMENTS MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE VERSUS THE GOVERNOR THERE ALL KINDS OF DYNAMICS HERE. THE COULD CHANGE THE WAY SOMETHING WOULD OPERATE AND FUNCTION BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PORTFOLIO OF THE STATE MORE TODAY. AND WHAT IT HAS DONE AND HOW DISCONNECTED IT HAS BEEN FROM THE ENTIRE ECG WORLD. I'M AND CONSIDERING THAT OUR WORLD IS VERY UNIQUE AND NOT SCHOOL CENTERED LIKE THE REST OF THE STATE PORTS WORK. IT DOES SEEM THAT IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE FIT TO GOVERN MOVING FORWARD WITH A VISION COMPREHENSIVELY FOR EASY OPPOSE TO SAY I'M. OTHER PROPOSALS WE'VE SEEN FROM THE RIGHT START COMMISSION OR FROM LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE DOCTOR AND LINDA DARLING HAMMOND. AROUND CREATING A STANDALONE EARLY EDUCATION AGENCY OR THINKING ABOUT OTHER WAYS TO COORDINATE. PERHAPS PIECES OF THE SYSTEM THAT COULD LIVE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AT THE CURRENTLY DON'T SUCH AS LICENSING. HOME VISITING OTHER KINDS OF PROGRAMS OF THAT NATURE THE DO AFFECT THE SAME POPULATIONS OF FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. CONFIGURED SO YOU WANT THE MONEY BUT NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S. I'M SORRY AT SO YOU MEAN TERMS OF THE STATE BOARD. I I GUESS I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING INCOME CONFUSED WITH. I'M CONFUSED WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM ON THE GOVERNANCE OF EARLY OF. MAYBE. A PRESCHOOL. REALLY CHARLIE SAID YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT THOSE OUT OF THIS DISCUSSION. NO I I ACTUALLY WOULD LOVE FOR IT TO BE IN WOULD ENCOURAGE FOR YOU TO HAVE IT BE A PART OF THIS DISCUSSION I'M JUST TRYING TO POINT OUT HOW UNIQUELY. THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF POTENTIAL FOR FIT UNDERNEATH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AS PROPOSED HERE BUT ABSOLUTELY ISSUE WERE TALKING ABOUT GOVERNANCE OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WE WOULD WANT YOU TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW. FITS IN THAT BECAUSE. PART OF THAT SYSTEMS ABSOLUTELY FUNDED UNDER THE SCHOOLS. AND THERE'S A THE VINTAGES PART OF A. I MEAN BUT I HEAR A LOT AS THEY'RE PART OF A CONTINUOUS VERTICAL EXPERIENCE RIGHT VIRTUE WE WANT CHILDREN IN THE. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND THEN YOU ON THAT GOVERN SEPARATELY IS IT I MEAN I'VE BEEN CONFUSED I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR ANY PARTICULAR PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW WHAT I WAS DOING WAS OUTLINING CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS. YOU ABOUT MOVING HE C. E. UNDER THE STATE BOARD WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF IT BEING RUN BY THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. BUT HE. OKAY I THINK BOTH OF US HAVE TWELVE NOON MEETINGS WE GOT ARRESTED YOU ADDS I REALLY DO PERCENT PARTICIPATION. AND DONE STATUS ARE OFFICES IS THIS ALMOST FORD AS AS IS TYPICAL THE INTERESTING. HEARING GOVERNOR'S RAISE MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT ANSWERS.
