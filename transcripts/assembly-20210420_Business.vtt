THE ONLY CANNABIS BILL THAT WE

00:51:57.948 --> 00:52:00.183
BE CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION IN

ADDITION TO THAT WHICH MIGHT

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:03.053
ALREADY BE OCCURRING THROUGHOUT

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:05.188
THE COUNTRY HEY P. TEN THIRTY

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:07.190
FOUR CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:09.459
THAT ALREADY- ALLOWS LOCAL

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:10.927
JURISDICTION PERMIT CANNABIS

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.429
CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. IF THEY

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:15.298
WISH. I RESPECTFULLY DECLINE

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:16.633
THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AT

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.667
THIS TIME BUT I WANT TO BE

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:19.102
CLEAR THAT I'M COMMITTED TO

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:20.237
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:21.805
COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE ISSUE IN

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:23.907
A CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.675
TO ADDRESS IT. I SINCERELY

00:52:25.742 --> 00:52:27.511
APPRECIATE- AND WOULD LIKE TO

00:52:27.577 --> 00:52:28.612
THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:30.647
STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK. ON

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:32.849
THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. LOCAL

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:34.217
JURISDICTIONS CAN PERMIT

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:35.719
CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:37.554
BUT THERE IS NO COMPARABLE

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:39.456
CONSUMPTION LOUNGE LICENSE AT

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:41.224
THE STATE LEVEL. SO LOCAL

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.226
LOUNGES MUST RECEIVE A STATE

00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:45.428
RETAIL LICENSE. THIS BECOMES

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:47.497
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE STATE RULES

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:48.965
FOR CANNABIS RETAIL LICENSE

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:50.767
DON'T FULLY ALIGNED WITH THE

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:52.402
BUSINESS PRACTICES OF CANNABIS

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.004
CONSUMPTION LOUNGES.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.705
SPECIFICALLY CANNABIS

00:52:55.772 --> 00:52:57.741
CONSUMPTION LOUNGES OPERATE

00:52:57.807 --> 00:52:59.342
THAT HOSPITALITY BUSINESSES

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:00.377
SIMILAR TO BARS AND

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:04.180
RESTAURANTS. NOT RETAIL OUTLETS.

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:05.882
THE MOST CRITICAL DIFFERENCE IS

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:07.517
THAT MOST CANNABIS CONSUMPTION

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:08.952
LOANS BUSINESS MODELS INCLUDE

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.720
THE SALE OF NON CANNABIS FOOD

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:13.356
AND BEVERAGES. NON ALCOHOLIC

00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:14.758
SIMILAR TO HOW BARS AND

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:17.160
RESTAURANTS OPERATE. STATE LAW

00:53:17.227 --> 00:53:18.728
DOES NOT ALLOW CANNABIS

00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:21.298
BUSINESSES TO SELL ANY ITEMS

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.632
OTHER THAN CANNABIS AND

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:24.668
CANNABIS PRODUCTS THUS CANNABIS

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:26.536
CONSUMPTION LOUNGES ARE UNABLE

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:28.605
TO SELL NON CANNABIS FOOD AND

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:30.840
BEVERAGES- AND WE'RE TALKING

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:32.142
ABOUT NON ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:34.978
HERE. AB TEN THIRTY FOUR WOULD

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:36.379
ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:38.214
PERMIT THE SALE AND PREPARATION

00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:40.917
OF NON CANNABIS FOOD AND NON

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:41.851
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES IN CANNABIS

00:53:41.918 --> 00:53:44.120
CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. THIS WOULD

00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:46.423
BE A COMPLETELY LOCAL DECISION

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.325
NO CITY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:49.693
PERMIT IT. THE FOOD AND

00:53:49.759 --> 00:53:51.461
BEVERAGES PREPARED AND SOLD ON

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.096
SITE WOULD NOT BE INFUSED WITH

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:55.198
CANNABIS AND THE BEVERAGES

00:53:55.265 --> 00:53:56.700
WOULD BE AS I MENTIONED NON

00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:58.735
ALCOHOLIC. THIS BILL SIMPLY

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:00.370
ALLOWS A LOCAL JURISDICTION TO

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:01.805
ALLOW CANNABIS CONSUMPTION

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:04.441
LOUNGES TO ALSO PREPARE AND

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.509
SELL NON CANNABIS FOOD AND

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:08.078
BEVERAGES. THAT ARE NON

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:10.347
ALCOHOLIC TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IF

00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:12.148

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:56.618
TIMES WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:59.487
PETS IN NEED. OFTEN REQUIRING

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:01.556

WIPING OUT THE BLOOD SUPPLY IN

THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA.

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.216
THIS FORCES US TO MAKE HARD

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.918
CHOICES BETWEEN WHICH PATIENTS

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:31.452

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:48.469
TWO COMPANIES SIMPLY CANNOT

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:50.572
