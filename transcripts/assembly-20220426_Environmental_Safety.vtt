WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:56.288
COMMITTEE AND THAT'S RESOURCES

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.824
WORKING ON FROM OF PLASTICS IN

00:10:58.891 --> 00:10:59.458
THE ENVIRONMENT FORREALLY QUITE

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:02.561
SOME TIME THIS IS A B. SEVENTEEN

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:03.729
TWENTY FOUR AND WHAT WE'RE

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:05.131
TRYING TO LOOK AT OR BETTER WAYS

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:06.966
THAT WE CAN START TO TAKE

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:09.935
MICROFIBRES OUT OF THE SYSTEM WE

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:10.803
KNOW THAT. WASHING MACHINES

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.506
DRYERS THAT THE PROCESS OF

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:16.108
CLEANING. CLOTHING BETTER MADE

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:19.378
FROM NON NATURAL FIBERS THAT

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.713
BREAKS DOWN AND WE GET

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.616
MICROFIBERS EVERYWHERE AND IT'S

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:24.417
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHAT

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.619
WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT IN THIS

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:27.486
BILL IS STATE OWNED WASHING

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:30.189
MACHINES BECAUSE WE THINK THAT

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.291
THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.660
TO ATTACH FILTERS TO THOSE IN

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:35.394
BECAUSE THEY ARE WASHING

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.097
MACHINES ARE MANAGED BY

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:40.232
EMPLOYEES AND PROFESSIONALS WE

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:43.235
OBVIATE THE NEED. FOR THE MORE

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:45.371
OBVIOUS THE CONCERN FOR NOT

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:46.605
HAVING APPROPRIATE MAINTENANCE

00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:49.508
ON THOSE FILTERS SO I THINK THIS

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:52.344
IS A- IMPORTANT STEP AS WE TRY

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:54.847
TO UNDERSTAND. THE ISSUE OF

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:56.582
MICROFIBERS HOW THEY GET OUT

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.517
INTO THE ENVIRONMENT GOING

00:11:58.584 --> 00:11:59.819
THROUGH WASTE TREATMENT PLANTS

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:02.154
AND OUT THROUGH SOME OF THESE

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.190
PROCESSES AND THINK THIS BILL IF

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:06.158
WE CAN GET THIS ENACTED WOULD GO

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.427
A LONG WAY TO SHOWING HOW THESE

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.396
KINDS OF FILTERS DO WORK WOULD

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.997
WORK. WHAT THE MAINTENANCE

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.399
ISSUES AND THE OTHER ISSUES ARE

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:15.234
AROUND THEM SO THAT I ASK FOR

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:18.304
YOUR ITEMS AND WITH ME IS CODY

FOR CALIFORNIA CUT DEEPER

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:50.803
ALLIANCES SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.404
AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR TODAY-

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:53.472
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:54.840
DESCRIBED MICRO PLASTICS ARE

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.475
EVERYWHERE. MULTIPLE SCIENTIFIC

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:57.743
STUDIES HAVE OBSERVED THESE

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.445
PLASTIC PARTICLES IN GUT BIOTA

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.547
AIR WATER SEDIMENT AND MOST

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.415
RECENTLY IN HUMAN BLOOD. WERE

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:04.483
EVER SIGNED AS THE VOTE THEY

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.185
HAVE FOUND THESE MICROPLASTICS

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.354
AND MICROFIBERS ARE ONE OF THE

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.488
MOST COMMON FORMS OF

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:10.856
MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION REPORTED

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:13.259

POLLUTION PATHWAY FOR

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:15.694
MICROFIBRES ESTHER WASTEWATER

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.730
FROM WASHING MACHINES- BECAUSE

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.165
MICROFIBERS OF THE PRODUCT OF A

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:21.066
VARIETY OF SYNTHETIC TEXTILES

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.034
EACH LOAD OF LAUNDRY CAN RELEASE

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:23.602
UP TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:25.671
MICROFIBRES INTO THE ECOSYSTEM.

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:27.306
AND BECAUSE THE SERVERS ARE SO

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:28.574
SMALL MOST WASTEWATER TREATMENT

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.409
FACILITIES DO NOT HAVE THE

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.244
ABILITY TO FILTER THEM OUT OF

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.479
WATER. AS A RESULT AN

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:34.246
EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.548
MICROFIBERS PASTOR WASTEWATER

CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS

ASSOCIATION I THINK MITCHELL

00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:26.216
AND- HIGHLIGHTED A LOT OF THE

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:27.351
EXISTING PROCESSES THAT WE GO

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:29.086
THROUGH ON THE ON THE LOCAL

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:30.621
LEVEL BUT WOULD LIKE TO JUST

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:32.156
MAKE. TWO QUICK POINTS- ON THE

00:46:32.222 --> 00:46:34.424
BILL FIRST THERE CONTINUES TO BE

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:36.393
AN ASSERTION THAT THIS BILLS

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:37.995
SIMPLY BRINGS PARITY BETWEEN

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:38.962
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:41.899

TO THEM WHEN IT COMES TO SCHOOL

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:47.437
CITING I WOULD SAY THAT'S A

00:46:47.504 --> 00:46:48.639
LITTLE BIT MISLEADING

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:49.273
CONSIDERING THE LOCAL RIGOROUS

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:50.774
LOCAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:51.975
TO GO THROUGH. PLACING

00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:53.610
ADDITIONAL STATE REQUIREMENTS ON

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:54.845
TOP OF THAT ACTUALLY CREATES

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:58.015
FURTHER INEQUITY- AND NOT PARITY

00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.917
BETWEEN THE TWO- TYPES OF

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:03.086

REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ARE-

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:10.527
SUBJECT ALSO MAKE THAT POINT.

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.329
I'M AND THEN FINALLY- SCHOOL

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:13.697
DISTRICTS ARE ALSO GIVEN

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:15.866
ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR FACILITIES-

00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:17.434
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO LOCAL AND

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:19.803
STATE FOR- BOND FUNDING CHARTER

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:20.637

WHICH HONESTLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO

HAVE BEEN A FORMER PUBLIC WORKS

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:03.473

PUBLIC WORKS CAMPUS OF THIS

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:12.349
DOCUMENTS AND- IT'S ALWAYS A

00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:13.883
CHALLENGE WHEN THE PUBLIC

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.920
SCHOOLS COME IN BECAUSE YOU DO.

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:19.289
GREAT EARLY YOU KNOW WHERE TO

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:21.992
LOOK AGENCY IN ENTIRETY ALMOST-

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:23.560
WHERE IS THE CHARTER SCHOOL IN

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:25.495
THE PRIVATE DON'T THAT YOU

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:27.931
ACTUALLY MUST COMPLY WITH ALL

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:30.634
THE ISSUES FOUND. AND IT'S

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.268
ERODING IS TO SAY THAT THEY

00:54:32.335 --> 00:54:36.206
DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:38.174
CLUB BECAUSE THEY DO. BUT I'M

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:39.242
GOING TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:40.777
REPRESENTATIVE I MEAN THIS BILL

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:41.911
IS PROPOSING THAT CHARTER

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:43.079
SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE

00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:44.214
TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:49.519
REQUIREMENTS- I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.421
SAYING ABOUT HOW. CHARTER

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:55.025
SCHOOLS CAN GO OUT FOR BONDS BUT

00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:56.993
IN TERMS OF ENSURING. THAT

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.596
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE LOCATED IN

00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:01.898
SAFE LOCATIONS THE CHILDREN OF

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:04.734
EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED IN SAFE

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:06.970
LOCATIONS I. RIGHT I'M HAVING A

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:09.305
HARD TIME SEEING WHY CHARTER

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:11.775
SCHOOLS WOULD NOT TO OR SHOULD

00:55:11.841 --> 00:55:14.010
NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

00:55:14.077 --> 00:55:16.079
SIXTEEN SAME STATE REQUIREMENTS

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.213
TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE IN

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.116
ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE. SIDES YEAH

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:22.852
I THINK IT'S JUST AN ISSUE OF-

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:24.854
ADDITIONAL PROCESSES TO GO

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:27.791
THROUGH- IF WE DIDN'T HAVE. THE

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:29.059
LOCAL PROCESSES THAT WE HAD TO

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.927
GO THROUGH SIMILAR TO THE WAY

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:32.562
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO AND WE JUST

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.931
HAD A STATE. LEVEL REQUIREMENT

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.800
SIMILAR TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAN

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:37.300
IT BE A MUCH DIFFERENT

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:39.669
CONVERSATION BUT PLACING A STATE

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:42.238
REQUIREMENT IN A STATE PROCESS

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:45.141
ON TOP OF IN ADDITION A EXISTING

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:47.110
LOCAL PROCESS THAT TAKES QUITE A

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:48.845
LONG TIME AS WELL. JUST CREATES

00:55:48.912 --> 00:55:52.749
FURTHER DELAYS AND- MORE TIME

00:55:52.816 --> 00:55:54.918
AND MORE MORE MONEY AND SO WE

00:55:54.984 --> 00:55:55.752
THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:57.020
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT STATE.

00:55:57.087 --> 00:56:00.557
REQUIREMENT THEN IT SHOULD BE-

00:56:00.623 --> 00:56:02.192
IN PARITY WITH WITH THE WAY

00:56:02.258 --> 00:56:04.494
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TREATED. IN

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:07.464
THIS LOW. VETERANS PUBLIC

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.766
SCHOOLS SO HOW TO COMPLY WITH

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:10.500
THE- LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:13.837
REQUIREMENTS. ALL THE ALL THE

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.371
FOR TO MARRY- GRACE BUT I DO NOT

00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:17.741
BELIEVE THAT IS ACCURATE I THINK

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:22.078
THERE HAVE WHERE B- IT'S A REAL

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:24.347
CHALLENGE I'LL BE HONEST WITH

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:26.049
YOU- SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:28.518
REGULARLY STATE THAT THEY DO NOT

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:31.454
HAVE TO SUBMIT TO OR COMPLY.

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:34.257
WITH LOCAL AGENCY AND THEY WILL.

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:37.227
NOT SUBMIT TO THE LOCAL AGENCY

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:41.664
FOR THE- AND THEY WILL IGNORE-

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:45.435
THE LIST PROCESS HE- IT HAPPENS

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:49.873
IT HAPPENS CONSTANTLY- THE

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:52.976
CHARTERS IN THE PRIVATE. IT'S

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.410
INTERESTING TO ME THAT THERE'S

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:55.945
THIS IDEA THAT YOU DON'T COMPLY

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:57.747
WITH THE STATE REQUIREMENTS

00:56:57.814 --> 00:57:02.552
BECAUSE YOU DO- BOTH. PROJECTS

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:05.121
AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT IS THERE

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:07.824
A STATE- AT SCHOOL OR PRIVATE

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.893
CHARTER SCHOOL THEY START WITH

00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:11.461
PREPARING TO FACE ONE AND THAT

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:12.929
GETS REVIEWED ENOUGH CAN

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:14.497
IDENTIFY YOUR FIRST INITIAL

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:16.933
ISSUES. AND THEN YOU GO ON IF

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.835
THE IF THERE ARE ISSUES

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:20.637
IDENTIFIED IN THAT PHASE ONE

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:23.072
WHICH IS CONSULTANT FOR PAIRED

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:24.073
ON BOTH SIDES. WHETHER IT'S

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.542
GOING TO DGSE OR WHETHER IT'S

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.143
GOING TO THE LOCAL AGENCY THE

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.546
BENEFIT IS IF IT'S GOING TO A

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:30.814
LOCAL AGENCY IT'S USUALLY HAS A

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.248
SCOPE OF WORK FOR THAT

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:34.050
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT. THAT

00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:35.985
WAS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:38.555
LOCAL AGENCY AND ALTHOUGH THE

00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:39.789
DEVELOPER WOULD PAY FOR IT THE

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:41.691
DEVELOPERS NOT OVERSEEN THE

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.026
DEVELOPMENT OF THAT

00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:44.794
ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT- THE

00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:48.131
CONTROL OF THAT CONSULTANT BY

00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:49.399
THE LOCAL AGENCY. LITTLE

00:57:49.465 --> 00:57:52.635
DIFFERENT. WITH DTS- EIGHT.

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:54.571
PREPPER OF THAT DOC IS GONNA BE

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:56.472

OR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEN

00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:00.543
COMMITTED TO DGSE. BOTH WILL

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.045
REVIEW THAT CASE ONE IF THERE

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.313
ARE ISSUES THAT ARISE AND IT

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:04.981
GOES TO THE NEXT UP. IN THE

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:07.750

IMPLYING THAT IT'S NOT OKAY SO

00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:48.625
IN IT BOTTOM LINE ARE YOU SAYING

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:52.395
THAT. TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:53.763

AGENCY REQUIREMENTS AS WELL YOU

00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:20.757
ALSO GET THE BENEFIT OF WHEN

THEY PROCESS THROUGH LOCAL

00:59:21.824 --> 00:59:23.059
AGENCY. LOCAL AGENCY STAFF IS

00:59:23.126 --> 00:59:24.327
AWARE OF THE ISSUES THAT COME

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:26.496
ABOUT LOCAL AGENCY DEALS WITH

00:59:26.562 --> 00:59:28.197
HOUSING PROJECTS AND WHAT HAVE

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.933

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:31.334
DEALING WITH WITH THINGS READ

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.202
MORE SENSITIVE- BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:34.704
DEALING WITH TWENTY FOUR SEVEN

00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:39.575
TO SILLY- SO. WHEN YOU GO

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:41.177
THROUGH A LOCAL AGENCY. HUMAX

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:42.745
HAVE. A MORE THOROUGH AND

00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:46.616
ROBUST- REVIEW AND UNDERSTANDING

OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:49.519

ASSURE HANNAH. GAS THE BAY AREA

00:59:58.061 --> 00:59:59.062
AN AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

00:59:59.128 --> 01:00:01.130
DISTRICT TO A- RESPONDED IN

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:02.865
CONTENTION THAT. SOMEHOW

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.033
CHARTERS AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.638
ALREADY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:09.272
RIGOROUS LOCAL REVIEW. I THINK-

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:10.974
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE'S-

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.309
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:14.544
AND IN THE REQUIREMENTS AND SEE

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.446
WHAT THERE'S- THERE'S ONE THING

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:18.181
THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:19.649
TRADITIONAL SEQUEL WHEN YOU'RE

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:21.184
DEALING WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.952
SO NORMALLY WHEN YOU DO SEE WHAT

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:24.420
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:25.788
THE PROJECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:27.724
BUT IN IN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.425
ABOUT PUBLIC SCHOOLS THERE IS

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.327
ALSO A- REQUIREMENT TO LOOK

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.830
OUTWARD. THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.698
ENVIRONMENT ON THE PROPOSED

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:38.601
SCHOOL SITE INTO MY PUBLIC

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.737
SCHOOLS WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THE

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:43.239
SITING THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:46.876
WHERE TO. FIRST QUARTER THEY

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.044
HAVE TO LOOK AT- IN FOR ARE FOR

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.979
THAT EMIT TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.080
YOU KNOW TO ASK THE TSC IF

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.882
THERE'S HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:55.051
HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES NEARBY AND

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:56.919
THOSE REQUIREMENTS DON'T EXIST

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.254
IN A TRADITIONAL SEQUEL PROJECT

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.056
IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE BUILDING A-

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:02.325
AN APARTMENT COMPLEX OR OR AT

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:03.926
THE NEW FACILITY OR SOMETHING

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.128
LIKE THAT AND SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:06.362
REALLY THE HEART OF WHAT THIS

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:09.732
BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS TO GET

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:10.400
THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:12.035
AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO TAKE THAT

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:14.137
OUTWARD LOOK JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:15.571
THAT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.507
WITHIN A QUARTER MILE FOUR

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.375

COMMENTS I GUESS NOT TOO MANY

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.904
QUESTIONS BUT WHEN YOU. TAKE A

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.939
SCHOOL SITE FOR THE STATE I GOT

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:50.706
TO GO THROUGH ALL THE

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.008
ENVIRONMENTAL SOLVE ISSUES. AND

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:54.177
CHARTER SCHOOL OR PUBLIC SCHOOL

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:56.179
THEY GOT TO DO THE STATE ISSUES

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:57.947

THERE. IT I DON'T SEE IT APPLES

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.886
FOR APPLES I SEE IT AS A MORSE

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:05.855
RESTRAINTS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS.

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:08.991
SO THEY DO NOT BUILD. OR EXPAND.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.227

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:12.261

YOU KNOW THERE AREN'T THAT MANY

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.351
CHARTER SCHOOLS BEING BUILT

LOCAL I ALSO SEE THAT DESPITE

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.767
WHAT THE WITNESSES SAID THAT

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:53.970

OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WHICH

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:36.365
THE AUTHOR TOUCHED ON. IT IT'S A

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:38.033
VERY NARROW DEFINITION AND

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.334

COMMUNITIES ARE THE POOREST IN

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:59.588
THE STATE. SO THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:00.355
THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:01.690

BECAUSE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.634
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL THAT

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:59.461
SOME QUESTIONS- TO CLARIFY MY

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:02.864
UNDERSTANDING SO THAT THE POINT

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.766

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:07.635

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:29.624
OPPORTUNITY UP TO THE STATES

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:30.992
OKAY IN FACT I THINK OUR

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:32.327
LEADERSHIP COULD HAVE AN IMPACT

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:34.896

TO ADDRESS SOME OF AQUA'S

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:48.009
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW- THE

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:50.612
CALAVERAS GREEN LEAVES OUT A LOT

01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:53.882
OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THAT

01:25:53.948 --> 01:25:56.417
OTHERWISE HAVE. I GUESS BETTER

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:59.721
AIR QUALITY- I AM SURE IT'S NOT

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:00.755
YOUR INTENT TO EXCLUDE THOSE

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:03.191
COMMUNITIES WHY WHY NOT JUST TO.

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:04.759

DRINKING WATER ABSOLUTELY

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:23.411
BECAUSE THE CALAVERAS SCREEN

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:24.646
DOESN'T JUST USE AIR QUALITY

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.047
RIGHT IT'S A CONSTELLATION OF

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:28.049
ENVIRONMENTAL FAILURES OVER A

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:30.552

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:39.561
DIFFERENT WAYS- YOU COULD YOU

01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:41.129
COULD DEFINE IT BY OUR

01:26:41.195 --> 01:26:42.864

AN INTEREST ON HOW THEY CAN FIND

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:48.403
ITS ADVANTAGE POOR AIR QUALITY

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:50.772

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:22.637
I DON'T THAT WE ARE. I THINK

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:25.440
WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:27.942
HOW TO DIVIDE PIE. WITHOUT

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:29.077
APPRECIATING THE FACT THAT IT'S

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:31.713
A NEW PART IN THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:33.481
FOLKS WHO CAN AND SHOULD BE

01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:34.983
HELPED AND- WE ARE COMMITTED TO

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:36.451
WORKING ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:37.685
MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES THAT

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:38.786
HAVE HISTORICALLY. NOT TO

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:39.921

AGREEMENT ON AND WE WILL

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:47.462
CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE

01:27:47.528 --> 01:27:49.263

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:51.299
RIGHT. NOW BUT WE KNOW THE

01:27:51.366 --> 01:27:52.066
HISTORIC CHALLENGES OR PUSH BACK

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:53.534
TO USING KALAN VIRAL SCREEN AS A

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:55.003

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:55.609
WE NEED TO KEEP BUT THINGS WE

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:58.879
DON'T NEED HOW TO TAKE ACTION TO

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:01.515

FORTY. AS YOU KNOW FOSS HAS

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:29.810
BECOME A VERY SIGNIFICANT TOPIC

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:31.345
IN WATER AND WASTEWATER IN THE

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.614
UBIQUITY OF THESE CHEMICALS

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.682
COUPLED WITH THE URGENCY FOR

IDENTIFY THE LEVELS OF P. FAST

01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:46.593
IN OUR SYSTEM THROUGH A

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:47.127
STATEWIDE MONITORING AND

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:48.962
REPORTING ORDER- PRELIMINARY

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:50.397
RESULTS FROM THE FIRST PHASE OF

01:42:50.464 --> 01:42:51.865
THIS EFFORT INDICATE THAT WE'RE

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:53.467
SEEING CONSISTENT LEVELS OF P.

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:55.235
FUSSING WASTE WATER FROM BOTH

RESIDENTIAL AND INDUSTRIAL

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:59.473
CHARGES IT'S COMING IN FROM

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.408
SOURCES OUTSIDE OF THOSE THAT WE

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:03.143
CAN CURRENT REGULATE THROUGH-

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:05.646
THE INDUSTRIAL PERMITS AT THE

LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT INDICATES IT

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:09.950
IS BEING USED IN PRADA. PEOPLE

01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:11.985
AND BUSINESSES. WE SEE

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:13.253
CONSISTENTLY THAT ARE MORE P.

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.521
FIVE COMPOUNDS IN EFFLUENTS

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:16.023
COMPARED TO THE INFLUENCE.

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:17.424
INDICATING THAT SOME OF THESE

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:19.159
CHEMICALS HAVE A TENDENCY TO

01:43:19.226 --> 01:43:19.993
TRANSFORM INTO MORE HARMFUL

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.428
COMPOUNDS DURING THE CONTROLLED

01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:23.530
TREATMENT PROCESS. AND THIS

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:24.998
TENDENCY IS REPRESENTATIVE OF

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:26.767
HOW THESE PERSISTENT COMPOUNDS

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:27.334
REACT IN THE NATURAL

01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:29.169
ENVIRONMENT. AS AGENCIES TASKED

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:31.672
HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT THIS

01:43:31.738 --> 01:43:34.374
IS A VERY DAUNTING PROCESS TO BE

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:36.376

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:37.911
DESTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY SO TREAT.

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:40.380
A SIGNIFICANT RATEPAYER EXPENSE

01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:41.448
WOULD ONLY DISPLACE THE CHEMICAL

01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:43.717
RESIDUALS TO A DIFFERENT WEIGHT

01:43:43.784 --> 01:43:44.518
DREAM. SO THE MOST COST

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:45.652
EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:47.220
APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:48.655
AS SOURCE CONTROL SOURCE

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:49.790
REDUCTION AND POLLUTION

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:51.358
PREVENTION. RIGHT NOW WE ARE

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:53.360
LIMITED BY THE LACK OF

01:43:53.427 --> 01:43:54.361
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THESE

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:55.529
CHEMICALS ARE USED IN COMMERCE

01:43:55.596 --> 01:43:56.797
AND UNTIL WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE

NINETY FIVE TWENTY SEVEN YEARS

03:20:41.028 --> 03:20:42.296
AGO. IN FACT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

03:20:42.363 --> 03:20:44.399
UPDATED EVERY YEAR THREE YEARS

03:20:44.465 --> 03:20:47.668

03:20:54.776 --> 03:20:56.511
WRECK HAVOC ON THE DELTA COUPLED

03:20:56.577 --> 03:20:58.579
WITH OTHER FACTORS. THIS IS

03:20:58.646 --> 03:21:02.784

BOARD STARTED THE MOST RECENT

03:21:08.589 --> 03:21:11.659
UPDATE TO THE BAY DELTA PLAN IN

03:21:11.726 --> 03:21:13.327
TWO THOUSAND DIED. THAT'S WHEN

03:21:13.394 --> 03:21:16.497
THEY STARTED THIS PROCESS SO

03:21:16.564 --> 03:21:17.498
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIRTEEN

03:21:17.565 --> 03:21:19.834
YEARS AGO. YOU COULD STILL FIND

03:21:19.901 --> 03:21:21.636
DELTA SMELT IN THE DELTA. BUT I

03:21:21.702 --> 03:21:23.171
REMEMBER HEARING FROM EXPERTS

03:21:23.237 --> 03:21:26.073
THEY SAID IF YOU DON'T DO

03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:27.208
SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY THE SMELTER

03:21:27.275 --> 03:21:30.678
GONE. AND THE SMELTER GONE- WILL

03:21:30.745 --> 03:21:32.380
SMELL TO HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND IN

03:21:32.447 --> 03:21:34.282
THE DELTA OF THE WILD FOR FOUR

03:21:34.348 --> 03:21:37.084
YEARS THEY DO HAVE SOME IN THE

03:21:37.151 --> 03:21:39.954
TANK. BUT CHAD THEY THIS IS ONE

03:21:40.021 --> 03:21:42.223
OF THESE. SPECIES THAT EXISTED

03:21:42.290 --> 03:21:44.525
IN VERY LARGE NUMBERS NOT AT ALL

03:21:44.592 --> 03:21:46.127
CLEAR YOU COULD BRING THEM BACK

03:21:46.194 --> 03:21:47.929
BY PUTTING IN A STARTER

03:21:47.995 --> 03:21:50.465
POPULATION WHEN. IF THE DELTA IS

03:21:50.531 --> 03:21:53.367
EVER GOING TO BE BETTER SO THEY

03:21:53.434 --> 03:21:56.037
MAY BE GONE FOREVER. REPORTS BY

03:21:56.103 --> 03:21:57.939
WHAT OUR LAW EXPERTS AND

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE HE

03:22:00.041 --> 03:22:02.677
FOUND THAT UPDATES DEBATE OUT TO

03:22:02.743 --> 03:22:04.178
PLAN. ARE URGENT NEEDED TO

03:22:04.245 --> 03:22:06.280
PROTECT CALIFORNIA MAKING WATER

03:22:06.347 --> 03:22:08.182
DATA FISH AND THE WATERSHED

03:22:08.249 --> 03:22:10.818
ITSELF FROM WORSENING THREATS

03:22:10.885 --> 03:22:14.188
CLOSE BY THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND

03:22:14.255 --> 03:22:15.289
DROUGHT. THE LACK OF MODERN

03:22:15.356 --> 03:22:17.024
WATER QUALITY STANDARDS ALSO

03:22:17.091 --> 03:22:18.993
HURTS LONG TERM PLANNING FOR

03:22:19.060 --> 03:22:20.962
WATER PROJECTS BY CREATING

03:22:21.028 --> 03:22:23.364
UNCERTAINTY IF THERE'S A PLAN

03:22:23.431 --> 03:22:27.335
YOU CAN SAY I WANT TO DO X. AND

03:22:27.401 --> 03:22:28.236
IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE PLAN.

03:22:28.302 --> 03:22:30.404
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN THANK

BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE

03:22:36.511 --> 03:22:40.882
WATER BOARD WANTS TO DO. SO THIS

03:22:40.948 --> 03:22:44.886
BOAT THIS BILL CO DEFIES THE

03:22:44.952 --> 03:22:46.787
CURRENT GOAL OF THE STATE WATER

03:22:46.854 --> 03:22:49.590

03:23:02.837 --> 03:23:05.740
. YOU KNOW. IT'S TAKEN THIRTEEN

03:23:05.806 --> 03:23:07.308
YEARS TO GET TO THIS POINT IN

03:23:07.375 --> 03:23:09.043
THE MEANTIME WE'VE HAD ONE

03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:11.946
SPECIES. COACH TANKED AND

03:23:12.013 --> 03:23:13.948
SEVERAL OTHERS ON THE BRINK OF

03:23:14.015 --> 03:23:16.250
EXTINCTION. SO IF THE DEADLINES

03:23:16.317 --> 03:23:21.289
MIX MR GAS AND WE WERE JUST SAID

03:23:21.355 --> 03:23:22.323
HERE IS YOUR DEADLINE. IT IT

03:23:22.390 --> 03:23:24.725
JUST IT COULD IGNORE IT SO WE

03:23:24.792 --> 03:23:26.561
HAVE A CONSEQUENCE. AND THAT

03:23:26.627 --> 03:23:28.930
CONSEQUENCE IS THE THIRD BE A

03:23:28.996 --> 03:23:32.066
PAUSE IN ISSUE WE KNEW WATER

03:23:32.133 --> 03:23:33.301
RIGHTS THAT WOULD A DISH THAT

03:23:33.367 --> 03:23:34.669
WOULD DIVERT ADDITIONAL FLOW

03:23:34.735 --> 03:23:37.038
AWAY FROM THE DELTA. OUR HOPE

03:23:37.104 --> 03:23:39.974
WOULD BE THAT HAVE THE PLAN DONE

03:23:40.041 --> 03:23:42.276
IS STAFF SAID THEY COULD. I

03:23:42.343 --> 03:23:44.645
THINK END OF THIS YEAR- BUT IF

03:23:44.712 --> 03:23:46.314
THEY DON'T THEN THIS WOULD COME

03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:48.583
INTO EFFECT WE FEEL THAT THIS IS

03:23:48.649 --> 03:23:51.719
SOMETHING THAT WOULD IN FACT-

03:23:51.786 --> 03:23:55.656
SPUR THE- THE WATER BOARD TO

03:23:55.723 --> 03:23:57.358
COME TO THE CONCLUSION. THIS

03:23:57.425 --> 03:23:59.994
TEMPORARY MORATORIUM AXES AN

03:24:00.061 --> 03:24:01.896
INCENTIVE TO COMPLETE THE AB-

03:24:01.963 --> 03:24:03.564
ADAPTION OF THE BAY DELTA PLAN

03:24:03.631 --> 03:24:05.232
AND ENSURES THAT THESE WATER

03:24:05.299 --> 03:24:07.835
RIGHTS PERMITS CAN BE ASSESSED

03:24:07.902 --> 03:24:09.670
USING CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS. SO

03:24:09.737 --> 03:24:11.906
ONCE YOU HAVE A PLAN YOU CAN

03:24:11.973 --> 03:24:14.775
THEN SAY- YES THIS IS CONSISTENT

03:24:14.842 --> 03:24:17.411
WITH THE PLAN WE CAN ISSUE THE

03:24:17.478 --> 03:24:19.146
WATER RIGHTS. MOVING FORWARD I

03:24:19.213 --> 03:24:20.381

TO AVOID UNINTENDED IMPACTS

03:24:24.185 --> 03:24:26.821
PROJECTS IF POSSIBLE. AND AGAIN

03:24:26.887 --> 03:24:29.824
WE- WE ARE ALLOWING RENEWAL OF

03:24:29.890 --> 03:24:31.459

03:24:31.525 --> 03:24:33.160

03:24:33.227 --> 03:24:34.195

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT.

OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE

03:33:50.684 --> 03:33:52.386
HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED

03:33:52.452 --> 03:33:56.757
POSITION ON THE BILL AND THAT IS

03:33:56.823 --> 03:33:57.958
FOR THREE REASONS AND I'LL COVER

03:33:58.025 --> 03:34:00.260
THE THREE. SO FIRST JUST THAT

03:34:00.327 --> 03:34:02.796
SUBDIVISION C. BE DELETED

03:34:02.863 --> 03:34:04.164
THERE'S ONLY THREE SUBDIVISIONS

03:34:04.231 --> 03:34:06.033
IN THE BILL SUBDIVISION FEES

03:34:06.099 --> 03:34:08.202
SHOULD BE DELETED. THIS IS THE

03:34:08.268 --> 03:34:11.605
PROPOSED CONSEQUENCE FOR THE

03:34:11.672 --> 03:34:13.073
SITUATION IF THE WATER BOARD

03:34:13.140 --> 03:34:15.909
MISSED THE TWO DEADLINES FOR

03:34:15.976 --> 03:34:18.679
PROPOSED ACTIONS UNDER THE BILL

03:34:18.745 --> 03:34:20.981
. THE PROBLEM IS THE CONSEQUENCE

03:34:21.048 --> 03:34:22.883
WOULDN'T AFFECT THE WATER BOARD

03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:26.019
WHAT IT WOULD D IS PUT ON HOLD

03:34:26.086 --> 03:34:29.489
A TOOL THAT WATER MANAGERS NEED

03:34:29.556 --> 03:34:31.391
AND THAT IS THE ABILITY TO

03:34:31.458 --> 03:34:34.328
OBTAIN A WATER RIGHTS. FOR THE

03:34:34.394 --> 03:34:36.029
DIVERSION OF WATER FROM THE

03:34:36.096 --> 03:34:38.665
WATERSHED TO SURFACE WATER

03:34:38.732 --> 03:34:41.368
STORAGE. ONE EXAMPLE UNDER THIS

03:34:41.435 --> 03:34:44.271
THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS A

03:34:44.338 --> 03:34:45.772
POSSIBLE DELAY FOR THE SITES

03:34:45.839 --> 03:34:48.375
RESERVOIR THAT'S A PROPOSITION

03:34:48.442 --> 03:34:50.010
ONE PROJECT WHICH WOULD BENEFIT

03:34:50.077 --> 03:34:53.313
SALMON. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED

03:34:53.380 --> 03:34:56.016
ABOUT THE DELAY OF PROJECTS IN

03:34:56.083 --> 03:34:58.118
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT

03:34:58.185 --> 03:35:00.053
WOULD PROVIDE OR HELP PROVIDE A

03:35:00.120 --> 03:35:02.222
RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY FOR

03:35:02.289 --> 03:35:03.790
COMMUNITIES IN THE VALLEY

03:35:03.857 --> 03:35:06.426
PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE'S-

03:35:06.493 --> 03:35:08.495
DECREASING GROUNDWATER PUMPING

03:35:08.562 --> 03:35:11.164
UNDER SIGMA. SO THAT'S THE FIRST

03:35:11.231 --> 03:35:14.234
ISSUE THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT

03:35:14.301 --> 03:35:16.370
THERE'S A SUBDIVISION AIM BE

03:35:16.436 --> 03:35:18.538
GIVE PROPOSED DEADLINES FOR

03:35:18.605 --> 03:35:21.308
WATER BOARD ACTIONS AND OUR

03:35:21.375 --> 03:35:23.610
CONCERN IS THAT THE DEADLINES DO

03:35:23.677 --> 03:35:25.912
NOT AFFORD ENOUGH TIME FOR

03:35:25.979 --> 03:35:28.348
INCORPORATION OF WHAT WE WOULD

03:35:28.415 --> 03:35:30.417
CALL AN INTEGRATED APPROACH

03:35:30.484 --> 03:35:32.953
THROUGH AGREEMENTS. AND YOU MAY

03:35:33.020 --> 03:35:35.188

THE PROPOSED DECEMBER THIRTY

03:35:52.339 --> 03:35:54.241

03:36:01.148 --> 03:36:03.183
TO GET TO THIS FOR BUT WHEN

03:36:03.250 --> 03:36:04.985
YOU'RE AT THE END YOU DON'T WANT

03:36:05.052 --> 03:36:06.853
TO RUSH THE PUBLIC PROCESS FEES

03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:09.489
THAT HAPPENED. AND WE'RE

03:36:09.556 --> 03:36:11.758
CONCERNED ABOUT TO PROCESS ABOUT

03:36:11.825 --> 03:36:13.160
ON STAKEHOLDER INPUT INTO THE

03:36:13.226 --> 03:36:15.562

PROCESS USES THE SEEK WHAT PART

03:36:17.564 --> 03:36:19.766
OF THIS THAT'S- A CRITICAL. THE

03:36:19.833 --> 03:36:22.803
THIRD ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S A

03:36:22.869 --> 03:36:24.538
PROPOSED DEADLINE FOR

03:36:24.604 --> 03:36:27.174

03:36:37.351 --> 03:36:39.186
THAT PLAN AMENDMENT THURS

03:36:39.252 --> 03:36:42.422
ONGOING LITIGATION RIGHT NOW AND

03:36:42.489 --> 03:36:43.590
WE THINK THAT THE AMENDMENT

03:36:43.657 --> 03:36:51.365
IGNORES AT LITIGATE AND- TO GET

03:36:51.431 --> 03:36:55.469
TO WHERE WE ONLY.

03:36:55.535 --> 03:36:58.205
