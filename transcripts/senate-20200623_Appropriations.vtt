THE BILL THE QUESTION IS THAT

HAVING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:40.044
ARE TERMINATED. I THINK IT'S

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.480
VERY CONFUSING. ALL I THINK IT

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:44.215
MAINTENANCE TO THE QUESTION

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:45.750
THAT ARE SENATOR FROM FREMONT

00:29:45.817 --> 00:29:48.119
WAS ASKING BECAUSE THERE'S AN

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:50.822
EXTENSION OF THIS CRISIS WE

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.757
BELIEVE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:54.259
THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT TO

00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:57.128
NEGOTIATE IN EXTEND. BEYOND

00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:58.329
LET'S SAY A SET SIX MONTHS

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:01.032
PERIOD AGAIN. THIS BILL IS

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:02.800
RETROACTIVE TO THE POINT OF

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:04.435
WHEN THE CRISIS STARTED IF I

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:06.504
RUNNER HAS HAD A HARDSHIP AND

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:08.072
YES AND IF IT EXTENDS BEYOND

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:09.941
THAT SIX MONTHS IT LEAVES THE

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:12.410
FLEXIBILITY TO EXTEND THE

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:15.413
PROGRAM. BEYOND THAT POINT. BUT

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:15.980
AS FAR AS THE HEART COST OF

00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:18.516
THAT. I CAN'T ANSWER THAT RIGHT

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:19.784
NOW THAT'S PART OF THE ONGOING

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.586
NEGOTIATIONS ARE WHAT THIS WILL

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:24.989
COST BUT WE'VE ESTIMATED- A FEW

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:28.426
HUNDRED- I THINK IT'S- ABOUT.

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:30.395
ROUGHLY FEW MILLION- THE FIRST

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:33.264

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:43.541
BILL WOULD PROHIBIT EVICTIONS.

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:45.009
PROHIBITIVE ACTIONS ON REQUEST

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:46.811

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.952
PROBABLY A WORK IN PROGRESS OF

00:30:54.018 --> 00:30:55.386
SOME OF THESE MIGHT BE. YOU

00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:56.854

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:19.477
IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE ECONOMIC

THE VICTIM PART THIS IS NOT

SITUATION WARRANTS THAT TO THAT

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:44.035
DOESN'T PREVENT THAT AND IT

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:45.570
DOESN'T INVOLVE ANY LANDLORD

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.338
WHO IS NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:48.072

00:31:48.139 --> 00:31:50.275
STILL CARRY OUT THEIR TYPICAL

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:52.143
UNLAWFUL DETAINER INFECTION

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.379
NOTICES AS- IF THIS BILL DIDN'T

I'M FOLLOWING UP ON SENATOR

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.227
BATES QUESTION THAT I SEE SOME

00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:10.828
MEMBERS TRYING TO FIND THOSE

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:12.497
BLANK LINES THESE THEY START ON

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:14.932
PAGE FIVE. OF THE TEXT OF THE

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:15.533
BILL THAT WAS ALSO ONE OF MY

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.570
CONCERNS- AND I YOU KNOW. I

00:32:19.637 --> 00:32:20.171
THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS MADE

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:22.807
WAS. IN ANSWERING CENTER BATES

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:24.542
QUESTIONS WE DON'T KNOW YET.

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.044
HOW MUCH TIS IS GOING TO COST.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.845
I WOULD REMIND ALL OF US ON

00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:29.213
THIS COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS THE

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.848
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WE'RE

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:31.916

COST. BEFORE THEY LEAVE THIS

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:35.820
COMMITTEE. AND GO TO THE FLOOR

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:37.055
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:38.856
REASON TO HOLD THIS BILL IN

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:41.092
COMMITTEE FOR RIGHT NOW- I DO

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:44.062
WANT TO. COMPLEMENT THE- THE

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:45.797
AUTHORS OF THE BILL. YOU KNOW

00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:46.597
THIS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:48.900
PROBLEM. OF FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA

00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:50.668
HAVE A HARD TIME PAYING RENT-

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.704
BECAUSE OF THE CO BID. AND THE

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.306
GOVERNMENT- REQUIRE SHUT DOWN

00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:57.475
OF OUR ECONOMY. AND THIS IS A

00:32:57.542 --> 00:33:02.013
VERY CREATIVE. WAY TO SOLVE A

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.683
VERY SIMPLE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.819
WITH THE WITH THE VERY CREATIVE

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:09.120
SOLUTION IS A LOT OF HOLES IN

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:11.789
IT AS HAS ALREADY BEEN POINTED

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:13.358
OUT- BY OUR GOOD CALLING FROM

00:33:13.424 --> 00:33:15.326
ORANGE COUNTY BUT YOU KNOW THE

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:16.661
SOME OTHER CONCERNS THAT I HAVE

00:33:16.728 --> 00:33:20.231
ABOUT THE BILL IS. IT ALLOWS

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:23.101
FOR THE FEDERAL TAX BOARD- TO

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.236
BURKE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO

00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:28.840
READ READ RECEIVE INTEREST IF

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:30.441
THE LANDLORD OWES THEM MONEY.

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:31.876
BUT THE LANDLORD IS NOT

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.010
RECEIVING INTEREST IF THE

00:33:33.077 --> 00:33:36.547
LANDLORD IS OWED MONEY. ANOTHER

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:38.015
PROBLEM THAT I SEE WITH THE

00:33:38.082 --> 00:33:38.783
BILL THAT I THINK SHOULD

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.218
CONCERN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US

00:33:40.284 --> 00:33:42.453
ON THE COMMITTEE HERE IS WE ARE

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.688
OBLIGATING FUTURE

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:46.491
LEGISLATURE'S- TO ACT ON ON

00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:49.360
THIS BILL- IN APPROPRIATIONS.

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:51.596
AND ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF THE

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:53.197
BILL IS UPON APPROACH

00:33:53.264 --> 00:33:53.965
APPROPRIATION OF THE

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:56.834
LEGISLATURE THE CREDIT MAY BE

00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:59.470
REFUNDED. SO LADIES AND

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:01.305
GENTLEMEN IF WE APPROVE THIS

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:03.474
TODAY AND WE'RE OBLIGATING

FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S IN THE

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:08.179
YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BEYOND.

00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:09.781
AND THEY JUST DECIDE YOU KNOW

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:11.048
WHAT WE DON'T CARE WHAT

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:13.050
HAPPENED IN TWENTY TWENTY. I

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:13.885
HAVE FOR THOSE LEGISLATORS ARE

00:34:13.951 --> 00:34:16.888
GONE. OR FOR WHATEVER VARIOUS

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:18.456
REASONS- WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.858
APPROPRIATED. SO HOW HOW ARE WE

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:24.862
GIVING. CONFIDENCE TO THE

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.230
LANDLORDS OR EVEN THE-

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:27.932
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THAT THE

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:29.467
DOES APPROPRIATIONS ARE GOING

TO TAKE PLACE- IN THE FUTURE.

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:34.772
THE OTHER THING THAT IS KIND OF

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:36.974
INTERESTING TO ME IS IT IN ALL

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.443
THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:40.411
THIS BILL REALLY DO SOUND GOOD

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:45.383
AT ALL MEANT THAT- IN THE IN

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:45.983
THE THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT AND

ALL OF THAT. THIS A PROPOSITION

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.858
IS ONLY FOR THE LANDLORDS AND

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.126
TENANTS THAT WANT TO

00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:58.696
PARTICIPATE IN IT. BUT THE BILL

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.331
WOULD PROHIBIT EVICTIONS OR

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:02.667
REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF OVERDUE

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.902
RENT FOR ALL LANDLORDS. WHETHER

OR NOT THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:09.874
DEFERRED GRANT PROGRAM SO I'LL

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:11.008
JUST CONCLUDE WITH THIS MISTER

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:12.844
CHAIRMAN I DO APPRECIATE THE

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.680

THINK IT'S IN THE OKAY IN THE

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:28.025
VERNACULAR OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:30.394
FULLY COOKED AND I THINK WE

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:32.630
NEED TO HOLD IN COMMITTEE AND

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:35.333
FILL IN THOSE BLANK LINES AND

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:36.200
TRY TO SOLVE THESE OTHER

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:38.202
PROBLEMS BEFORE WE MOVE IT TO

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:40.037

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:46.077
HOPE THAT THEY GET IT RIGHT SO

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:47.979
LET'S HOLD IT HERE IN AND FIX

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:50.047
IT BEFORE WE SEND IT ON. THANK

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:51.582
YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WHICH

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.551
BRADFORD- DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:54.352
THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES I HAVE A

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:56.487
COUPLE COMIC. SO I MAKE MY

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:58.155
COMMENTS AND THEN IF YOU COULD

00:35:58.222 --> 00:35:58.890
DO YOUR CLOTHES I DON'T SEE ANY

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:01.759
OTHER HANDS GO UP- SO I CAN

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:03.728
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY

00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:07.164
COLLEAGUES. THE GOAL OF THE

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:09.967
WORKING GROUP. THAT'S BEEN

00:36:10.034 --> 00:36:12.336
WORKING TO HELP WITH ECONOMIC

00:36:12.403 --> 00:36:14.906
RECOVERY FROM THE COVE IT DEBT

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:17.775
CRISIS. IS TO STABILIZE THE

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:20.745
RENTAL HOUSING MARKET- AND THIS

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:23.014
IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM TO DO

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.683
THAT- NO ONE IS GOING TO BE

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.419
FORCED TO OPT IN- BUT WE'VE

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:31.022
HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM BOTH

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:33.357
LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. THAT

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:34.959
THERE HAVE TO BE POLICIES THAT

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:38.129
ARE FAIR TO BOTH- THERE'S A MIS

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:39.830
UNDERSTANDING OF SOME PEOPLE IN

00:36:39.897 --> 00:36:41.999
CALIFORNIA THAT. YOU KNOW EVERY

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:46.904
LANDLORD IS PART OF A MAJOR.

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.105
LANDLORDS THERE'S A LOT OF

00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:51.409
WORKING PEOPLE WHO WHO BOUGHT A

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:53.411
SECOND RENTAL INCOME AS A WAY

00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:55.179
TO OFFSET THEIR LACK OF A

00:36:55.246 --> 00:36:55.947
PENSION OR THEIR LACK OF A

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:57.682
RETIREMENT. AND SO THERE'S A

00:36:57.748 --> 00:36:59.584
LOT OF MOM AND POP LANDLORDS

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.586
OUT THERE. WHO NEED STABILITY

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:03.921
AS WELL AS THE TENANTS WHO NEED

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:05.990
PROTECTIONS AS WELL AND SO THE

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:08.025
IDEA WAS TO COME UP WITH A

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:09.160
THREE PARTY AGREEMENT THAT

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:11.362
WOULD NOT AFFECT. THE GENERAL

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.798
FUND OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:14.832
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:16.267
CONSTITUTION THE BALANCED

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:18.402
BUDGET AND SO THIS WAS THAT

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:19.937
PROPOSAL TO SHOULD BRING

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:22.974
STABILITY. AND FAIRNESS TO THE

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.643
RENTAL HOUSING MARKET AND IT'S

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.312
TOO IMPORTANT OF A TASK. TO NOT

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:29.981
HAVE THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:32.650
THE PROCESS- OBVIOUSLY GIVEN

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:36.087
ARE TRUNCATED SCHEDULE THERE

00:37:36.153 --> 00:37:36.621
ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:38.155
WORKED OUT. BUT I DON'T THINK

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:41.058
WE CAN. JUST TURN OUR BACK TO

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:42.860
THAT NEED TO STABILIZE THE

00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.762
RENTAL HOUSING MARKET BECAUSE

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:46.564
OF THIS PARTICULAR SNAPSHOT IN

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:48.366
TIME. THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:50.568
DONE ON THIS PROPOSAL SO.

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:51.235
OBVIOUSLY THE CHAIR IS GOING TO

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:52.870
BE SUPPORTING MOVING THIS

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.705
PROPOSAL OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:57.108
ON TO THE FLOOR. SO WE CAN

00:37:57.174 --> 00:37:58.976
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HASTE.

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:00.144
BECAUSE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:02.013
MARKET PLACE STABILITY IS THAT

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:04.248
GREAT SO WITH THAT MISTER

00:38:04.315 --> 00:38:04.849

TO A FEW THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:15.126
RAISED. YES THERE ARE SOME.

00:38:15.192 --> 00:38:16.527
GRAY AREAS STEEL BECAUSE WE'RE

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.396
STILL IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:20.164
TO WORK THIS THING OUT AS I

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:22.166
STATED IN MY- OPENING COMMENTS

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:24.735
PROBABLY. THE MOST DISCUSSED

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.037
THE ISSUE DURING THIS CALL THE

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.638
CRISIS IS LANDLORD TENANT

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:30.074
RELATIONSHIPS. AND THE FEAR OF

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.676
EVICTION BUT AT THE SAME TIME

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.611
THE FEAR OF LANDLORDS NOT BEING

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:35.346
TO MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AND

00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:36.614
WE TOOK ALL THAT INTO

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.783
CONSIDERATION AS WE- TRY TO

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:40.985
CRAFT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:42.553
THAT LOOKS OUT AFTER BOTH SOME

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.288
FOLKS. EARLY ON THE DISCUSSION

00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:47.024
FELT WE WERE TOO HEAVY ON THE

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:49.360
TENANT SIDE AND THEN AT THE

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:52.697
SAME TIME AS OUR CHAIRMAN

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:53.497
STATED. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:54.865
LANDLORDS AS BECAUSE THESE ARE

00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:56.567
NOT ALL MAJOR CORPORATIONS USER

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:57.935
MOM AD POP OPERATORS SOME

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.937
FOLKS RURAL OWNER OCCUPIED HAVE

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:01.639
A TRI PLEX THE LIVE IN ONE UNIT

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:03.607
IN AB TWO UNITS AVAILABLE. AND

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:05.042
THEY'RE RUNNING OUT AND AGAIN

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:07.078
AS STATED IT'S THEIR RETIREMENT

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:08.279
IT'S YOUR COLLEGE FUND FOR

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:10.181
THEIR KIDS OR THEIR GRANDKIDS.

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:12.149
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.751
THEY'RE PROTECTED SO. THIS IS

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:14.618
WHAT THIS MEANT A MEASURES

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:15.753
TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.788
THREAD. THE NEEDLE THE BLANK

00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:18.889
AREA IS TO LEAVE THE

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:20.858
FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO THE

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:23.360
ON GOING. DEVELOPMENT OF THIS

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:25.863
CRISIS BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S STILL

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.765
MOVING JUST WHEN WE THINK IT IS

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:29.533
SKYLIGHTS SUCCEEDED WE SEE NOW

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.869
THERE IS X. INCREASING SPREAD

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.938
INTO A LOT OTHER STATES SO WE

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:34.939
WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS AND NOT

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:37.508
JUST PUT. A HARD NUMBER ARE

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:39.844
DATE STOP ON THIS MEASURE SO WE

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:40.911
WANT TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:42.847
THAT IF. THIS CRISIS CONTINUES

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:44.582
ON WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:46.550
FLEXIBILITY- I THINK THE

00:39:46.617 --> 00:39:48.419
COMMITTEE THE STAFF HAS DONE A

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:50.788
GREAT JOB TO ESTIMATE YES THIS

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:51.822
WILL COST THE STATE OF

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:53.591
CALIFORNIA THE NEXT TEN. YEARS

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:54.825
POSSIBLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.227
OF DOLLARS BUT AT THE SAME

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:58.996
TIME. IT'S A LOOSE NUMBER

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.631
BECAUSE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:03.167
PROGRAM. AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.802
MANY FOLKS WILL PARTICIPATE I

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:06.937
MEAN IN THE BEST. CASE SCENARIO

00:40:07.004 --> 00:40:08.506
WE WOULD HOLD NO ONE WOULD HAVE

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:09.640
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:11.275
BUT IF. THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:15.246
CHOOSE TO AGAIN THAT LANDLORD

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:15.913

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.815
DISSIPATED AND WE'VE WE'VE- WE

00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:19.884
HAVE TO FACTOR THAT IN BUT NOT

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.051

SO I UNDERSTAND THOSE CONCERNED

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:30.728
BUT AGAIN- THIS IS GOING TO BE

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:32.096
REFLECTIVE ON HOW MANY FOLKS

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:39.270
ESTIMATION A WHAT THAT COST

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:40.771

02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:33.156
