FLOWER- YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL

00:22:18.303 --> 00:22:20.272
CANNABIS ITSELF. AND THEY'VE SB

00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:22.340

THE SOFT COMPLY WITH OUR INDOOR

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.254
SMOKING WILL ALSO THEY HAVE AN

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:38.156
OUTDOOR AREA THAT THEY CAN

00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:38.857
CREATE INTEREST ACTED AREA.

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:40.459
THAT'S FINE IT IS INDOORS OR TO

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:42.594
