SUBCOMMITTEE FORESTED ADMINISTRATION. TODAY WE'LL DISCUSS THE BUDGETS OF CAL STIRS. THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE CALIFORNIA SECURE CHOICE RETIREMENT SAVINGS INVESTMENT BOARD. CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY. IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. THE PLAN FOR THE GENDER ZERO ALL ITEMS RETURNED ABILITIES ITEMS LATER THE BUDGET SESSION. WE WILL CALL WHICH IS WOULD OF A QUORUM FIRST WILL HELP GO IT'S OFTEN SUBCOMMITTEE SERGEANTS WE CALL THAT THE MEMBERS PLEASE. SO GO HEAD START OFF ON A MISSION NUMBER ONE. UPDATE ON THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SUPPLY REPORT LANGUAGE. FOR CUSTOMERS MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE. ON THAT WAS PART OF THAT TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. SO. AS THE AS A BRIEF BACKGROUND. LAST YEAR THE. AND IT STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT BOARD. REQUIRED CALAVERAS STAFF TO REVIEW. TO REVIEW. SORRY. TO REVIEW VARIOUS. OPTIONS WITH REGARD TO A LONG TERM FACILITY PLANNING. A ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS WAS TO LOOK AT THE CONSTRUCTION. OF AN ADDITIONAL. TOWER ADJACENT TO OUR. EXISTING. CAMPUS OTHER ALTERNATIVES WERE ALSO TO BE EXPLORED INCLUDING A LONG TERM LEASE OPTION. AND. PURSUING. THE PURCHASE OF A SEPARATE BUILDING. AND ALSO. DOING THEIR THE NECESSARY TENANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR THAT. WHEN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE I WAS FINALIZED I'M IT WAS ENVISIONED THAT CAL STORE STAFF WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE THAT INFORMATION TO THE BOARD. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE. AREN'T THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT. HA AND BY OCTOBER FIRST AT TWENTY NINETEEN. SINCE THAT TIME. CAL STATE THE CULTURES BOARD HAS REQUESTED THAT STOP ACCELERATE THIS PROCESS. AND ACTUALLY BRING FORWARD THIS ANALYSIS IN THIS DATA ON BACK TO THE BOARD IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. EXACTLY ONE YEAR EARLIER. SO AS PART OF THAT WE WOULD ALSO. MEET OUR COMMITMENT TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE BY BRINGING FORWARD THAT DATA I'M TO YOU AT THE LATEST BY OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ARE WE ARE ENDEAVORING TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU EARLIER. BUT THERE ARE SOME CONSTRAINTS WITH OUR THIRD PARTY INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS REALISTIC CONSULTANTS THAT WE ARE DEPENDING ON CERTAIN DATA. ANALYSIS FROM THEM AS WELL. WITHOUT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I ALSO FORGOT TO INTRODUCE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE. ROBIN MATTSON CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF CUSTER'S. GO ABOUT YOUR QUESTION WE GOT IN ONE OF THE BOARD. THAT ONLY LEAVES ONE MONTH FOR OVERSIGHT IF YOU COME BACK IN OCTOBER GHOST THE BOARD NOVEMBER CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING WOULD COME TO THE LEGISLATURE IN OCTOBER AT THE ABSOLUTE LATEST OCTOBER FIRST. THE BOARD WOULD HERE AND TAKING ACTION ON THAT INFORMATION IT MID NOVEMBER. AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE SUPPLE ONE LANGUAGE IT'S JUST A YEAR EARLIER. BUT IT. OKAY I'M SO GLAD. SO THE ORIGINAL. TIMELINE WAS TO GO TO THE BOARD IN NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN WITH A REPORT TO IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN SO THE SAME. SPAN OF TIME BETWEEN THE ACTUAL BOARD ITEM AND THAT DUE DATE FOR THE REPORT. THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE OF REPORT ITEMS THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET. ANY EARLIER THAN OCTOBER FIRST OR COMMIT TO GETING ANY EARLIER AND THAT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL COSTS. UP THE PROJECTED SPENDING ON THE OPTION TO BUILD THE TOWER. ANY QUESTIONS DUTCH CHOI. I DON'T KNOW ARM. EXACT. YOU KNOW AND. NEED CELL OF YOUR CUSTOMER BUT. SINCE YOU YOU ARE SPEAKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR. PROF XIN TO BILLION ABOUT POWER. AMANDA SO IN OTHER. IN ALL. EXPANSION OF YOUR OPERATION. I I KNOW WHAT THE CUSTOMER IS SO I I I AM YOU KNOW ONE OF THE. WE TIED TO TEACHERS AND GETTING COSTS MORE P. SELF UP. PENSION BENEFIT RIGHT NOW. BUT. INSTEAD OF. EXPANDING. FISCAL FACILITY OR EMPLOYEES. HAVE YOU DONE ANY ANALYSIS SO. OF. CONTRACTING OUT. TO OUTSIDERS. THE. ARE FOR EXAMPLE ALONE NON LIGHT LIKE A FEW DATA T. FINISH OUR SERVICE IS SAYING THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW MANAGEMENT FIRM SET OUT THE ODD LA. YOU YOU YOU CAN YOU. A MY MY FOR. GUT FEELING IS THAT YOU CANSAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. CONSTRUCTING THE BUILDING ITSELF BY AND DAN NOW FEELING WITH THE. NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE UNIT TO FEAR LA WITH YOU MORE ASSETTHE MANAGERS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SALARY WOULD BE IS SOMEWHERE. AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND. MAXIMUM ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE TO FEEL IN THAT BUILDING. NICK IF YOU COMPARE THAT THE THAT WOULD BE. PROBABLY EVEN NAM BETTER PERFORMANCE OUT OF YOUR ASSETS ARE AND THOSE SAVINGS STATE SOME MONEY. HAVE YOU DONE THAT KIND OF APPROACH ANALYSES. ABSOLUTELY I THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THAT'S ACTUALLY GREAT SEGUE TO THE PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT NEXT BY TO ANSWER THAT DIRECTLY. YOU KNOW. WE HAVE BEEN TRANSITIONING FROM EXTERNALLY MANAGED PORTFOLIO SENSE. I'M ROUGHLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REGULARLY EVERY YEAR MOVING MORE AND MORE ASSETS TO INTERNALLY MANAGED. AS OPPOSED TO EXTERNALLY MANAGED. AND THERE ARE MANY BODIES OF KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE WITH REGARDS TO THAT THAT THE BENEFITS OF DOING THAT I WOULD JUST KIND OF HIGHLIGHT ONE WHICH IS THE C. E. AND BENCHMARKING. FIRM THAT PROVIDES ON DATA. REALLY ACT GLOBALLY FOR PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEMS AND. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE NOTABLE. FINDINGS FROM THEIR WORK AND UP SURROUNDING THIS IS THAT. ON AVERAGE. AND INTERNALLY MANAGED PASSIVE. IT IS IS MUCH MUCH CHEAPER AND STILL IN IN THE PASSIVE ENVIRONMENT CAN STILL ACHIEVE SAME RETURN. SO IT RANGES FROM ASSET STRATEGY TO INVESTMENT TYPE BY IT COSTS ANYWHERE FROM THREE TIMES. YOU TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT TO OUTSOURCE ASSETS FOR. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. SO IF YOU LOOK AT. AT A HAVING ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OFFICERS. THERE'S COST AVOIDANCE IS BY BRINGING THOSE ASSETS IN HOUSE THAT. THAT MORE THAN WHAT WOULD COVER THE COST OF THAT ADDITIONAL SPACE. FOR JUST A KIND OF A VERY. KIND OF SIMPLIFIED EXAMPLE WE TOOK SOME DATA FROM C. E. AND THAT. BASICALLY SAID THAT IT'S ABOUT TWENTY ONE BASIS POINTS TO EXTERNALLY MANAGE. ASSETS IF YOU DO IT AND HOW MUCH YOU CAN DO IT FOR ABOUT FOUR BASIS POINTS AND WHEN YOU DO THE MATH ON. THE SIZE OF THE FUND WE HAVE IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT IT ACTUALLY. SAVES TO TO DO THIS WORK IN HOUSE AND. NOT EVERY ASSET STRATEGY AND NOT EVERY PORTFOLIO CAN BE MANAGED INTERNALLY BUT THE ONES THAT WE CAN AND ONCE WE KNOW THAT WERE. GONNA BE GREAT OUT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WERE THAT WERE PURSUING. BEFORE YOU GET ONE A PLUS FOR SECOND GOT A QUORUM HERE IS GOING TAKE ROLE PLEASE. COOPER HERE ALLEN CABALLERO CHIU. CHOI HERE. SO YOU ARE SAYING BASICALLY BY THREE TIMES SO. COSTING MORE FOR CONTRACTING NOT EXTERNALLY. THAT'S CORRECT IN A VERY CONSERVATIVE. EXTERNAL MANAGER WOULD BE. ABOUT AT A MINIMUM THREE TIMES MORE OF THE COST THAN INTERNALLY MANAGED. SO INCLUDING VIA INITIAL NOT EXPANSION OF FOR CONSTRUCTION AND THEN ALSO A LONG TERM FULL TIME EMPLOYEES OUT EX NUMBER WHAT PEOPLE. AND THAT THE A BENEFITS OF FOREVER HUNDRED YEARS ESTILO. IT ACOSTA LAST OF FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT. THE EXAMPLE I'M REFERRING TO. BASICALLY LOOKED AT THE SCOPE OF THE. PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SHORTLY BUT IT. BASICALLY LOOKED AT A FIVE TYPE TIME HORIZON BUT. EVEN LOOKING OUTWARDS FOR THE LONG TERM. A CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES SALARY. INCLUDING WITH ON BENEFITS AND PENSION AND HEALTH CARE. AND THEN THE INDIRECT COSTS THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BE CHARGED WITH FOR HAVING OF A BUILDING IN RESOURCES AND THAT AND THAT AND ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD NEED. IS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN SENDING THESE ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY FIRM TO MANAGE ITS ORIGIN DID NOT AND NEVER TO SWING. PULL BACK ON THAT I WANNA GO BACK TO THE FACT OF THE THE EXTINCTION LAST YOU GUYS CAME FOR US. US TO PUSH UP TO NINETEEN. NOT AGREE ESTAS BRING A BACKLESS SHIRT EIGHTEEN AND THE ISSUES THAT COMES BACK OCTOBER. WAS LEGISLATURE'S ISSUER CHANGES IN THE NEXT MONTH THE GOES BACK TO THE BOARD. SO HOW LONG TIME THERE SO THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE ELDRITCH SHARON REQUEST TO BRING IT BACK TILL THEM TO EXCUSE ME TO PUSH LOT NINETEEN. AND I WANNA BRING IT BACK SO I'M REALLY CONFUSED. WHY THAT WAS? SO ORIGINALLY WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIMELINE FOR BRINGING ON THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT FIRM AND THE ARCHITECT AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEED THAT UP SO THAT'S YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. RICHARD COOPER THAT. ORIGINALLY THAT THE LANGUAGE AS PRESENTED WAS FOR EIGHTEEN WE ASK BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF US TO GET THROUGH ALL THE PROCESSES TO ACQUIRE THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO DO THE ESTIMATES. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS AND NOW WE'RE BACK AT THE ORIGINAL REQUEST. IT WAS FREELY ILLEGALS OFFICE DO YOU THE COMMENTS. RYAN MILLER FROM THE ILIO I WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON ON THE BUILDING BUT I I GUESS WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. IT CERTAINLY IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. BUT TIMELINE OF THE BUILDING IN PARTICULAR. IF THE REPORT COMES IN IN THE FALL THE LEGISLATURE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH UP PERTINENT A TO. TO IT YOU KNOW GIVEN SNOW SESSION DATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT MAY NOT REALLY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO SCRUTINIZE. THE REPORT SO. YEAH I BET MAYBE BEEN MAY BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE COMMITTEE TO WORK WITH CAL STIRS AND SEE IF YOU KNOW THERE'S A KIND OF ALTERNATIVE TIMELINE THAT CAN BE HASHED OUT. THAT SOMEONE RIGHT NOW AS A CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE A TIMELESS LOOKING OVER NICKELBACK AND IN FIGURE SOMETHING ELSE OUT BUT. TO GIVE SUCH SHORT TIME LINE IN CASE SOMETHING DOES COME UP. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE SO RULED WORK WITH CASTERS ON THAT BOAT. AND WE NEED FIGURE SOMETHING ELSE OUT. RIGHT SO WE'RE PREPARED TO ANSWER BUTTONS THAT QUESTIONS EXCEPT FOR A AND B. BY JULY SO THAT'S YOU KNOW. THE IT'S JUST THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE ACTUAL FINAL COST ESTIMATES THAT WERE CONCERNED THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE. SO WHAT WE COULD DO IS PROVIDE. NOT TO EXCEED AMOUNTS SO THAT'S A POSSIBILITY. BUT ALSO WE WORK WITH STAFF ON THAT MEASURE FIGURE SOMETHING OUT BUT RIGHT NOW. I DO WANT EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. HOME SO GLAD ONE ITEM NUMBER TWO. THIS INFORMATION ONLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU INTERNAL ASSET MANAGEMENT. THE REQUEST IS FIFTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. IN FIFTY EIGHT POSITIONS OVER A FIVE YEAR TIME HORIZON. OF THAT AMOUNT WE ARE REQUESTING THREE POINT FOUR MILLION AND FOURTEEN POSITIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THE RATE REMAINING AMOUNT OF THAT'S REQUESTED AND IT'S PROPOSAL WOULD BE DRAWN DOWN. AS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES ARE IDENTIFIED. AND AT THAT POINT. CAL STIRS STAFF WOULD. HAVE A A THE PUBLIC AGENDA NOTICE WITH FEE CASTERS FORWARD AND REQUEST THOSE. AND SHORTLY AFTER WE WOULD BE SENDING. A JUSTIFICATION LETTER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALSO. AT JAIL BE SEEN NOTIFICATION LETTER. REGARDING TRYING DOWN ADDITIONAL ASSETS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BENEFITS AS WE WERE BRIEFLY DISCUSSING A MOMENT AGO ABOUT BRINGING ASSETS IN HOUSE. THE OBVIOUS ONE THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IS COST AVOIDANCE IS THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCIES. ARM AND THERE'S. WHAT'S NOT REALLY TALK ABOUT A LOT IS THE INCREASED LIQUIDITY OPPORTUNITIES THAT A LARGE ORGANIZATION LIKE. I'M CALAVERAS I REALLY VALUES. SO I THOUGHT I WOULD OPEN IT UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS SINCE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER SHIRKING GO AHEAD AND JUST THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA PLEASE ABSOLUTELY. AREN'T SO WITH REGARDS TO INCREASE INVESTMENT TRANSPARENCY THIS IS REALLY FROM CAL STIRS PERSPECTIVE. ARMED WHEN YOU HAVE DIRECT VISIBILITY INTO AN ASSET YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEING INVESTED AND YOU CAN CAN'T MEDICAID DIRECTLY WITH THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER. AND NOW YOU COMPARE THAT TO AN EXTERNALLY MANAGED STRUCTURE LET'S USE THAT PARTNERSHIP FOR EXAMPLE. MORE ONE LIMITED PARTNER HAN AMONGST THE MANY WERE ALL OF THE DECISIONS ARE PRIMARILY MADE BY THE GENERAL PARTNERS SO. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ISN'T AS REAL TIME AS WE CAN GET IF WE MANAGE IT AND HOUSE. MOVING ON TO QUESTION NUMBER TWO. I'M HOW WHAT THE PROPOSAL MAINTAIN OVERSIGHT. AS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED. SO THERE WOULD BE A PUBLIC. AGENDA ITEM IN WHICH WE WOULD ASK. MCALISTER'S BOARD TO DRAW DOWN AND NATIONAL ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM THIS PROPOSAL. IF THEY WERE TO APPROVE THAT WE WOULD. SEND A NOTIFICATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. JUSTIFYING THE NEED TO DRAW DOWN FROM THOSE ASSETS IN THAT WOULD TRIGGER A THIRTY DAY JAIL PC NOTIFICATION AS WELL. MOVING ONTO THREE HOW WOULD CALPERS COMMUNICATE WAS STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE DECISION MAKING. BOB SAID IS REALLY TWO VENUES FOR THIS AND THE FIRST IS WE DO REGULAR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PRIOR TO ANY PUBLIC BOARD MEETING SO WE WOULD MEET WITH. OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND DISCUSS THE TOPICS IN THE AGENDAS AND. HEAR THEIR CONCERNS AND COMMENTS. AND THEN OF COURSE AT THE ACTUAL AGENDA OR EXCUSE ME AT THE ACTUAL. BOARD MEETING THERE IS ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO. HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT ANY OF THE ACTIONS OR ITEMS THAT WE ARE HEARING. SO HOW THE STAFF RELATES TO HOW THIS ADDITIONAL STAFF RELATES TO THE CAPACITY OF OUR CURRENT BUILDING SO. SO ABSENT ABSENT ANY POSITIONS WE ARE ALREADY FORECASTING THAT BY JULY ONE NINETEEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND. SHORT TERM LEASE BECAUSE WE'RE REACHING CAPACITY IN OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE. SO BECAUSE. WE COULD WE COULD. ABSORB SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. THIRTY TO FIFTY POSITIONS RIGHT NOW IN OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE AND AFTER THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN WE WOULD NEED AGAIN. SHORT TERM LEASE CAPACITY. YES YES YES IN REVOLUTIONS FIFTY THREE FIFTY EIGHT I THINK IS SO THAT YES THE TOTAL LAST IS FIFTY EIGHT OF THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR FOURTEEN IN THE BUDGET YEAR. YOU CAN YOU CAN ABSORB HOW MANY IN EXCESS OF FIFTY RIGHT NOW. IT SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIRTY TO FIFTY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONTRACTORS THAT ARE ON SITE AS WELL SO THAT AND AND THEN WHEN YOU COMPOUND THAT WITH. ON REGULAR ATTRITION AND TURNOVER ON IT YOU KNOW BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY POSITIONS AS OF RIGHT NOW. OKAY. ILLEGAL. I WILL. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS. ANOTHER EFFORT. THE CULTURE'S BEEN MAKING FOR MULTIPLE YEARS NOW TO BRING MORE OF THEIR INVESTMENT SERVICES IN HOUSE. SO REGARDING THE PROPOSAL ITSELF WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS BUT OF COURSE THERE IS THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS BCP AND. THE ITEM ONE CONCERNING THE BUILDING. AND SO. WE WOULD NOT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD THE ITEM OPEN SEEMS REASONABLE BECAUSE I AS YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CAL STIRS ON THE ON THE ON THE BUILDING ISSUE. YOU KNOW THIS PCP MAY MADE A CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DEPENDING ON HOW THAT PLAYS OUT THINGY FINANCE. AND EVERYTHING TOWARD PUBLIC FINANCE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL AND HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO THE RECOMMENDATION. OKAY HIM QUESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEE. REPETITION IS ALSO ITEM OPEN SO WILL THE OPEN. LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER THREE THANK YOU THANK YOU INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT SUSTAINABILITY AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M A BECKY GRAYSCALE WITH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE. GENEROSA DEPUTY TREASURER FOR INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. TO I THINK WE'LL START WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE REQUEST AND THEN WE'LL PROCEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE. AGENDA BY THE COUNCIL BUDGET. HELLO MEMBERS AS CHAIR THANK YOU FOR HEARING US TODAY I'M HERE WITH A FUNDING REQUEST FOR THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR REQUESTING GENERAL FUND. OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE FOR THIS CURRENT AND BUDGET YEAR AND INTO PERPETUITY FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD BE ONE TIME. THE AUGMENTATION IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE. EXPANSION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT S. TEO WE HAVEN'T HAD A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE ONGOING. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE LICENSES PREDOMINANTLY. FOR. ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS MOVING HARDWARE TO VIRTUAL PLATFORMS REDUCING AND OUR POWER CONSUMPTION THROUGH TECHNICAL TECHNOLOGICAL EFFICIENCIES MITIGATING VULNERABILITIES MEETING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS WITH MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SERVICES. FORMERLY THIS HAS BEEN PAID FOR THROUGH. AND SPENT YEAR AND FUNDS AND WE FIND THAT TO BE AN UNSUSTAINABLE AND AN UNCERTAIN AND AN UNRELIABLE FUNDING STRATEGY. SO THIS REQUEST IS HERE TO ADDRESS THAT SO WE CAN REDUCE THOSE UNCERTAINTIES AND VULNERABILITIES. WE HAVE REQUESTED TO BE SEE PEACE IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE CHIANG ADMINISTRATION ONE IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND ONE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND THIS IS OUR THIRD. THE FIRST ONE WAS FOR ELEVEN POSITIONS TO TRUE AT THE AMOUNT OF STAFF THAT SUPPORTED THE IT COMPUTING SERVICES FOR THE S. T. O. THE BOARDS COMMISSIONS AND AUTHORITIES CHAIRED BY THE TREASURER. THE SECONDS FOR CYBERSECURITY THIS ONE DOES NOT INCLUDE P. WISE IT IS JUST FOR THE ON GOING LICENSING AND PROVISIONING OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. IN ADDITION TO SOME TRAINING VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF TRAINING AND TRAVEL. OKAY ONE TO TANGO QUESTION BY TRICIA BOUQUET. A WHAT OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES HAS THE SCO UNFUNDED IN ORDER TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY OF ITS IT SERVICES. TYPICAL OF OF MOST DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE USED YOUR IN SAVINGS FOR IT INFRASTRUCTURE PURCHASES US SAVINGS FROM SALARY SAVINGS OPERATIONAL SPENT EXPENSES IN OUR OTHER DIVISIONS. AND HARPER THE COST OF OPERATING IS INCREASING FOR EXAMPLE RANTS COST OF GOODS AND THERE'S. BUCKLEY NO AUGMENTATION FOR THOSE INCREASED COST IN THE US DEALERS FLEXIBILITY IN ABSORBING THESE COST IS DECLINING. QUE PAT SECOND QUESTION WHERE HAVE COST INCREASE FOR THE IT SERVICES IN THE PAST. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BUILD UP I'M THE MANAGER OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT AT THE OUR TREASURES OFFICE. HOME MY COMMENTS ON COSTS ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE TABLE ON PAGE SIX OF THE OF THE. THE CP WHICH. SCRIBES HOW ARE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS GROWN OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S AN ENTERPRISE INFRASTRUCTURE IN SUPPORT OF THE S. TEO ITS PORTS COMMISSIONS AND AUTHORITIES. BUT THERE'S TO COST ELECTED PRESENT IT OUGHT TO OFFER A WE HAD INCREASES IN OUR CAPITAL COSTS ARE AGGREGATE CAPITAL COSTS OVER THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD. AND IT ALSO THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS HAVE IMPACTED OUR OPERATING. COSTS ARE ANNUAL OPERATING COSTS. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YES TO A SPENT. A TWO POINT SEVEN IN EXCESS OF TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON INFRASTRUCTURE. UPGRADES OR INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS NEITHER ESSENTIALLY NEW HARDWARE NEW SOFTWARE. THIS IS NOT A. COMPLETE BECAUSE THIS IS THE MAJOR ITEMS TERRACE MOTHER. THE DISH WILL BUT THESE ARE THE THE BIG HITTERS. AND IN ADDITION AND AND MAKING THOSE PURCHASES IT IS ALSO IMPACTED OUR OPERATING EXPENSES TO TUNE OF. SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. SO THESE ARE. IT WILL COST EXPENDITURES ARE CLASSICS MENTORS AND ADDITIONAL COSTS TO BE INCURRED AS WE GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. TIME OR OTHER DEPARTMENTS OFFICES IT FUNDED FROM THE GENERAL FUND. DUMB* DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GENERALLY SPEAKING HOW DEPARTMENTS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND USE A PORSCHE THAT FOR THEIR IT CHO. THE BCAAS NASTY ó GET BENEFITS FROM THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES AND IF SO WHY WOULD THEY NOT HELP FUND THIS PROPOSAL. SAID YESTERDAY ON THE BCAAS CURRENTLY FUND APPROXIMATELY NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THE I. T. DIVISION COST. OF THAT EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT IS REIMBURSEMENTS GENERAL FUND IS ONLY EIGHT PERCENT AND THE CENTRAL SERVICE COST RECOVERY FUND IS FIVE PERCENT. FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES B. SCO'S DEPARTMENT WIDE FUNDING SPLIT FOR FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT REIMBURSEMENT SIXTEEN PERCENT GENERAL FUND AND NINE PERCENT. CENTRAL SERVICE COST RECOVERY FINE. TO GIVE A LITTLE BACKGROUND AT FOUR YEARS AGO THE IT DIVISION ESSENTIALLY MIRRORED THE SDO SPENDING SPLIT AS THEY WERE SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT REIMBURSEMENT FOURTEEN PERCENT GENERAL FUND ANY PERCENT US CENTRAL SERVICE COSTS BUT. SINCE IT TIME THE IT DIVISION SUBMITTED BCP'S AN AUGMENTED ITS BUDGET THAT THAT JAN JUST EXPLAINED PRIMARILY THROUGH REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THE BCAAS THIS HAS RESULTED IN A CURRENT FUNDING SPLIT OF EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT REIMBURSEMENTS EIGHT PERCENT GENERAL FUND AND FIVE PERCENT. CUT CENTRAL COSTS SERVICE COST COVERED BY. THIS REQUEST FOR GENERAL FUND IS TO ASSIST THE SDO AND BRINGING IT DEFUNDING BACK INTO REALIGNMENT WITH THE REST OF THE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE NOT REQUESTING ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THE BOARDS COMMISSIONS AND AUTHORITIES AS THEY HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED A THREE HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASE IN IT COST OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. WHILE THEY ARE DRIVING SOME BENEFIT FROM THIS AUGMENTATION THE BULK OF THIS AUGMENTATION IS DRIVEN BY THE TREASURES INITIATIVES. WE NEED THE AUGMENTATION KEEPING. UP WITH THE INCREASING IT DE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS BUT OUR RELIANCE ON REIMBURSEMENTS IS THAT ITS CAPACITY. IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS WE'RE GOING TO BE LOSING AND WEAK REIMBURSEMENTS WHICH ARE. FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND AND. TEN YEARS AGO WE WERE UP THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT GENERAL FUND SO WE'VE HAD QUITE A DECREASE IN THAT WAS. PRIMARILY DUE TO SHIFTING FUNDS DUE TO STATE FISCAL STRASSER WERE REALLY JUST TRYING TO REALIGN OURSELVES OR ACTUALLY. GOING TO ENTER INTO A STUDY TO LOOK AT OUR COSTS VERSES ARE AT. FUNDING TO SEE IF WERE APPROPRIATELY ALIGNED SO WE JUST FEEL THIS AD GENERAL FUND IS A. APPROPRIATE REQUEST. TO MEET THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COST. THANK YOU LL. HOWLING CURSING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO MODIFY THE PROPOSAL TO FUND THIS AUGMENTATION AND FROM THE BOARDS COMMISSIONS AND AUTHORITIES FROM THERE. AS WELL AS SCO FROM THEIR VARIOUS FUNDS THAT SUPPORT THOSE ENTITIES RATHER THAN FROM THE GENERAL FUND. EXCLUSIVELY ON WE KNOW THAT BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH S. T. O. AYE IT DOES APPEAR THAT PORTS MISSIONS AND AUTHORITIES AS WELL AS THE TREASURER'S OFFICE WILL BENEFIT FROM THESE. ACTIVITIES ARE BASICALLY ON TO FOR THAT AS WAS DESCRIBED SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY JUST KIND OF CORE IT OPERATIONS THERE THINGS LIKE HARDWARE SOFTWARE. TO TRAVEL AND TRAINING FOR THE IT STAFF AND THOSE IT STAFF SUPPORT NOT ONLY. THE TREASURER'S OFFICE ITSELF BUT ALSO THE BOARDS COMMISSIONS AND AUTHORITIES. AND THERE'S ALSO SOME FUNDING OF FOR THE SOFTWARE THAT SUPPORTS THE TREASURER'S INITIATIVES RELATED TO TRANSPARENCY AND THEY'RE. ON THE TREASURES OFFICE HAS INDICATED THAT THOSE ARE BENEFIT ALL OF THOSE ENTITIES AND SO WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THEY ALL HELP FUND THOSE ACTIVITIES. ON AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE APPROACH THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST WHEN THERE IS THAT PROPOSAL FOR EXAMPLE. TO FUND THE DATA AND GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY POSITIONS ON THE IDEA BEHIND FAT ON WAS TO HAVE THE PORTS MISSIONS AND AUTHORITIES FUND THEM SO THAT IT WOULD. KIND OF CREATE THIS BALANCE AND THAT I'M ESSENTIALLY IN GENERAL I HISTORICALLY THE IDEA HAS BEEN ALL OF THOSE AND IF ENTITIES THAT BENEFIT. OUR FROM ITS IT SERVICES WOULD HELP PAY FOR THEM. FINANCE. WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S. PROVIDING MORE BALANCE FOR IT THEY HAVE FIOS IT STRUCTURE. ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SADDAM OPEN. MISSILE MELINDA BEFORE. CALIFORNIA SECURE CHOICE RETIREMENT SAVINGS INVESTMENT BOARD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COOPER OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M KATIE SILENCE HIM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAL SAVERS FORMERLY SECURE TREISMAN JOINS. BY OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR BRIAN GHOULS AND.

ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT OUR LOAN REQUESTS TODAY ABOUT WAY OF REMINDER CAO SIEVERS IS THE STATE'S NEW RETIREMENT SAVINGS VEHICLE FOR WORKERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. I RETIREMENT SAVINGS AT WORK. SO THE HIGH LEVEL OF DATA THAT WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO BUILD THE TEAM INFRASTRUCTURE TO. LAUNCH THE PROGRAM IN A PILOT PHASE IN THE FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND A FULL STATEWIDE LAUNCH IN EARLY TWENTY NINETEEN. AND THAT WOULD BEGIN THE THREE YEAR PHASE ROLLOUT BY EMPLOYER SIZE. AND SO WE'VE WORKED HARD TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE BOARD TO DESIGN THE PROGRAM AND AND RIGHT REGULATIONS IN THE LAST YEAR. SO JUST LAST WEEK THE BOARD APPROVE REGULATIONS THAT WE'LL BE SUBMITTED TO THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW NEXT WEEK. AND HE EXACT TIMING OF THE PILOT AND FULL STATEWIDE LAUNCH WILL DEPEND HEAVILY ON OUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE. PRIVATE SECTOR FIRM WHICH WILL RUN THE ACCOUNTS AND INVEST THE. MONIES ON ON BEHALF OF OUR SABERS. AND IN TERMS OF OUR BUDGET REQUEST TODAY I'VE FOR THAT AT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR REQUIRE WE ARE REQUESTING TWO POINT FIVE. MILLION DOLLARS IN LOAN FUNDING A TO AUGMENT THE SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE FROM THE CURRENT. CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET OF ROUGHLY THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. I AM IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE'VE. UTILIZE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THAT. AUTHORIZE LOAN FUNDING TO DATE. AND SO FOR THIS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST THAT INCLUDES. APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE MILLION FOR STAFF AND ANOTHER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FOUR. CONSULTANTS AND MARKETING MATERIALS OTHER EXPENSES. I MEAN I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THIS CURRENT YEAR SPENDING LEVELS OR THE PLAN SPENDING. A MUCH ALSO NOTE THAT THIS LOAN REQUEST DOES ALLOW. AFTER A SCENARIO IN WHICH THE BOARD MAY DECIDE TO. AND ESSENTIALLY SPREAD OUT SOME OF THE START UP COSTS FOR ON FOR THE EARLY PARTICIPANTS TO KEEP FEES LOW FOR FOR THEM ACROSS THE BOARD. WITHOUT A BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT. NEVER GOTTEN DON'T MISS COVERAGE HONEST LITTLE BIT AGO SO I'M SORRY. ELLIOTT. WE HAVE NO CONCERNS FINANCE. THAT WAS PART OF HIS PROPOSAL HAVE NO CONCERNS ANY QUESTIONS NUMBER. OKAY HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE THIS PROGRAM IS IT'S MADE ITS WAY TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS NICOTINE SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. LAST YEAR THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT IT ACTION TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL. CAN STEP PROVIDE AN UPDATE ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE IN HIM CONCERNS IN THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT THIS PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS SINCE THE REPEAL OF THE A OBAMA ERA DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RULE THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR US. THERE'S BEEN NO FURTHER FEDERAL ACTION AND AS YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THAT. IT THAT REPEAL BY CONGRESS AND. WE. WE ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ANNOUNCES WITH INTERNAL COUNSEL EXTERNAL COUNSEL AND. WERE. I FELT CONFIDENT THAT WE STILL REMAIN TO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE ON STRONG LEGAL GROUND HERE. THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE SAFE HARBOR FROM A RECESS REMAINS AND I IN ADDITION TO ALL THAT LEGAL ANALYSIS THAT'S BEEN DONE WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE NOW OF WATCHING OUR SISTER PROGRAM IN OREGON. WHICH IS. SEVERAL MONTHS INTO ITS EXISTENCE IT HAS ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT'S FUN WITH PARTICIPANTS SAVINGS SO WE ARE WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT RUN ST STRONG LEGAL FOOTING AND WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS. RICK. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU RECOMMENDATIONS OVERSIGHT OF OPEN. THE NEXT MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE AND A CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY. INVESTOR STATION FINANCING AUTHORITY VETERAN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS TINA CARILLO AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF KEEP FIVE. KEEP IS REQUESTING REIMBURSEMENT EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY IN THE AMOUNT OF HEAT POINT TWO MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. EVER TO BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BREAST APPROPRIATELY CARRY OUT OUR FUNCTIONS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA HUB FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY FINANCING AT OUR LAST PRE HEARING WE ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE PROGRAM. I'M FOR THE MEMBERS TODAY INSIDE US MERRIAM JOCKEY BLOCK TO DO THAT WE PROVIDED A QUICK PRESENTATION FOR YOU. I'D LOVE TO OKAY GREAT THEN YOU GOOD MORNING OR AFTERNOON. BMW BLOCK WITH KATE FIVE. THINK YOU. SO YOU HAVE THE. I PRESENTE SCHATTEN SO ALL JUST I'M GO THROUGH VERY BRIEFLY HOW THE FIRST SLIDE JUST. REITERATES I REQUEST AND JUST. REMINDS THE COMMITTEE THAT THE. CALIFORNIA HARPER ENERGY EFFICIENCY FINANCING PILOTS ARE FLOODED WITH UTILITY RATE PAYER FUNDS. I'M SO WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR ANY EXPENDITURE OF STATE FUNDS JUST AUTHORITY. I'M SITE NUMBER THREE ADDRESS SAYS WHY WE'RE DOING THESE. PILOTS IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS JUST SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH PUBLIC. I DOLLARS OR EVEN RATE PAYER DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS AND IF WE WANT TO RETURN VICIOUS GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS WE MUST BRING MORE PRIVATE CAPITAL INTO THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY FINANCING SPACE. THE GOAL OF THESE PROGRAMS IS TO USE A SMALL AMOUNT OF RATE PAYER DOLLARS AND TO REALLY LEVERAGE PRIVATE CAPITAL. AN INCREASE PRIVATE CAPITAL FINANCING FOR. ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS IN THE RESIDENTIAL SMALL BUSINESS AND LARGE COMMERCIAL AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY SECTORS. TIME SLIDE NUMBER FOUR. OUTLINES THE GOALS OF THE FINANCING PILOTS WHICH IS TO DEVELOP A SCALABLE AND LEVERAGED PRODUCTS. AND TO TEST WHETHER OR NOT THESE PILOTS CAN THEN BE SELF SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT THE REPAIR FINDS THERE'S SOME BASICS OF OUR PROGRAM HERE WHICH I'VE COVERED. WERE ALSO WHILE WE'RE RIGHT NOW AND I'MBUILDING THE PROGRAM AND I OWE YOU INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY TERRITORY WE'RE BUILDING A PLATFORM THAT COULD BE LEVERAGED FOR A FULL STATEWIDE PROGRAM. AND INCLUDING THE AYE MUNICIPAL AND COOPERATIVE UTILITY. I JURISDICTIONS IN THE FUTURE WERE ALSO BUILDING THE FIRST OPEN MARKET ON BILL REPAYMENT PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. IT'S PARTLY WHY WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY AND THAT ROLLOUT IS WE DON'T HAVE A MODEL FROM ANOTHER STATE TO FOLLOW WHERE. TRYING TO. AND DO THIS WALL MANY OTHER STATES ARE ALSO TRYING TO DO IT. AND THEN SLIDE NUMBER FIVE GIVES YOU. AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATUS OF THE FEATURES OF THE DIFFERENT PILOTS. BOB BETWEEN THE RESIDENTIAL AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY SMALL BUSINESS AND LARGE COMMERCIAL. I AND SLIDE NUMBER SIX TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM CALLED REAL WHICH LAUNCHED IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND WE ARE PROVIDING FINANCING TO HOMEOWNERS THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN. SO MANY OTHER FOLKS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE AYE PACE FINANCING WHICH HAS A SUCCESSFUL MODEL IN MANY WAYS BUT THERE ARE MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO PUT A LIEN ON THEIR PROPERTY OR SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE EQUITY IN THEIR HOME TO DO SO. AND THEY'RE JUST NOT A LOT OF UNSECURED FINANCING PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET. THAT ARE OFFERED AT THE ON THE LENGTH OF. AT THE DURATION THAT CUSTOMERS NEED TO IN ORDER TO I'M HOW ABOUT A LARGE PROJECT LIKE IN EACH BLOCK UPGRADE OR AT THE INTEREST RATE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD AT THE AMOUNT THEY WOULD NEED TO. BORROW TO DO THOSE PROJECTS SO THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. AND WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE CREDIT HAS BEEN IN ORDER TO GET MORE ATTRACTIVE FINANCING FOR. REGULAR HOMEOWNERS SO FOR EXAMPLE A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PROJECT ON FIVE YEAR TERMS. FOR A HOMEOWNER USING OUR PROGRAM THEY COULD SAVE THIRTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IN INTEREST OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT. AND. FLY NUMBER SEVEN SHOWS YOU ARE LOANS TO DATE WE JUST YOU I'M HAVE HIT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION. IN RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS AND THIS IS ALL I AM. TWO POINT FOUR MILLION THAT IS BEING SPENT BY HOMEOWNERS ON PROJECTS THAT ARE REALLY BEING DONE BY VERY HYPER LOCAL RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONTRACTING FIRMS. TO THE RESIDENTIAL ENERGY UPGRADE MARKET IS VERY DECENTRALIZED IS A LOT OF MOM AND POP SMALL BUSINESSES. SO LOT OF THAT MONEY IS GETTING AYE REPLENISHED INTO THE LOCAL ECONOMY SUPPORTING GREEN JOBS WHILE HELPING HOMEOWNERS SAVE ENERGY AND MONEY. I'M SO WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE UPTAKE OF OUR PROGRAM WE'VE GROWN A LOT SINCE LAUNCH WITH A LONG WAY TO GO. I'M THAT WE'RE GENERATING. LOT OF INCREASED INTEREST YOU CAN SEE OUR LOANS ACROSS THE STATE THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE SO FAR. IT'S ABOUT SIX POINT EIGHT FOUR PERCENT. AND. AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE CONTRACTORS ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. AND JUST TO REINFORCE THAT THAN UNSECURED PRODUCT SO TYPICALLY IF INTEREST RATES WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER. THINKING. OZ SLIDE NUMBER EIGHT SHOWS THAT I AM ARE PLANNED FOR A GUY POSSIBLE BUSINESS AND AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY PROGRAMS THAT ARE YET TO LAUNCH. TO FILL SIMILAR GAPS IN THE MARKET TO COMPLEMENT OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE THANK YOU LL. HOW INCREASING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WERE RECOMMENDING MODIFYING THE PROPOSAL SO INSTEAD OF PROVIDING ALL OF THE FUNDING IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD? A THREE POINT SIX MILLION EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THREE MILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND ONE POINT SIX MILLION AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE THREATS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE AMOUNTS OF SPENDING THAT KEEP A ESTIMATES IT WILL NEED IN THE UPCOMING THREE YEARS. WE THINK TAKING THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S TYPICAL BUDGETING APPROACH TO. BUDGET OVER A MULTI YEAR REQUEST. AND IT ALSO ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE OF A BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF ADJUSTING SPENDING LEVELS IN FUTURE YEARS SHOULD THAT BE NEED HEAD. OF FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE ARE CHANGES TO THESE PILOT PROGRAMS. AND WE WOULD KNOW THAT WERE ALSO RECOMMENDING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THESE PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNTS IN THE THREE YEARS NOT TO EXCEED THAT THE TOTAL. AMOUNT CURRENTLY REQUESTED. WITH A JAIL BE SEEN NOTICE AND WE THINK THIS WILL PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO KATE FOR AS ITS IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS WHILE STILL. MAINTAINING LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND. SO ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTROL OVER THESE FUNDS. FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRPERSON WE KINDA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH A LOW'S RECOMMENDATION. A QUESTION MEMBERS. S. CARRIER. I JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND I'M EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING THE LOANS WHEN I READ IT I THOUGHT IT IF YOU WERE MORE LIKE A THIRD PARTY HAVING. HOPE. HOPING BUT HOPING TO. FACILITATE CORRECT YOUR CORRECT OKAY WE ARE AYE AND SO ARE OUR PROGRAMS TO DATE HAS PORTED TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCING THROUGH FOR CREDIT UNION LENDERS SO PRIVATE LENDERS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL. AND FACILITATE THE PROGRAM OKAY AND THE WAY WE DO THAT IS THROUGH A CREDIT ENHANCEMENT TO HELP LOWER THE COST SO AS AND LENDERS IN ROLE WE PROVIDE A CREDIT ENHANCEMENT BEHIND THE LOAN. TO HELP THEM LOWER COSTS AND EXPAND ACCESS WERE ALSO PROVIDING A STANDARDIZED PLATFORM. IN RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE ON THIS PROGRAM THE CONTRACTOR. ENGAGEMENT AND WILL BE BUILDING AND ON THE OVER PAYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE ADD AS MARY MENTIONED IT'S THE FIRST OF ITS KIND. TO TEST WHETHER ON THE OVER PAYMENT INCREASES THE SECURITY AND ACCESS THE FINANCING FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS. IT'S GREAT WORK YOU'RE DAMN JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT WHEN YOU SEE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT LOAN GUARANTEE. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IT'S A FINITE POOL SO FOR ANY EVERY ENROLLED LOAN WILL PUT A PERCENTAGE OF THE LOAN INTO AN ACCOUNT IT. WE DO TRY TO TARGET LOW MOD INCOME. ORG PROVIDE A HAVE YOUR INCENTIVE TO GET A BROADER ACCESS AND WE'RE EXPANDING THAT ALSO TO. CREDIT CHALLENGED SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT CREDIT SCORES THAT ALWAYS REFLECT INCOME SO EXPANDING ACCESS BOTH TO THOSE WITH LOWER CREDIT SCORES AS WELL AS TO LO MEIN INCOME SO. THE LENDER WILL THEN BE ABLE TO RELY ON THAT FUND SO IF THEY DO CHARGE OFF A LONER FOR THOSE LOANS THAT GOES BAD. THEY CAN BE MADE PARTIALLY HOLE. WE HAVE DESIGNED IT SO THAT LETTER ALSO A SKIN IN THE GAME. SO WE DON'T COVER THE FULL LOS. AND THAT SITE NUMBER SIX WITH THE TABLE THERE SHOWS YOU THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE LENDER STANDARD PRODUCT AND WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO OFFER TO BORROWERS. I'M IF THEY HAVE WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OUR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. AND IN ONE FINAL QUESTION ON. IT IS THE ARE YOU ARE YOU ALSO FACILITATING PASTE LOANS ARE INVOLVED IN PACE LOANS AS WELL. SO THAT THAT CALIFORNIA HAVE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY FINANCING OR THE CHIEF WHICH IS THE SUBJECT FOR THIS PCP DOES NOT ADDRESS PAYS FINANCING. I'M KATE FATAH. UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN. WHO IT AUTHORIZED A FUNDING DID PROVIDE US FUNDING TO PUT TO DEVELOP A RISK MITIGATION PROGRAM FOR PACE MELONES ON THE RESIDENTIAL SOCKED SECTOR HERE IN CALIFORNIA? I'M SO TODAY KATE BUT DOES HOW DOES A TEN MILLION DOLLAR LOSS RESERVE AS A BACKSTOP FOR RESIDENTIAL PACE IN CALIFORNIA BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY SUBJECT TO THIS BCP OKAY. SO WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IT IF YOU CAN. SAY WITH THE PACE. ON LOANS IN THE FIRE. REGION WHERE THE HOUSES BURNED DOWN AND OTHERS NOT NOT ONLY IS THE PACE LOAN DUE AND PAYABLE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO. INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN HOUSES GONE AS WELL YEAH SO THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION I'M CINEMA COUNTY IS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE LOCAL LIKE TRUE LOCAL PACED PROGRAMS HERE IN THE STATE. WE THEY DID DO AN INVENTORY AFTER THE FIRES AND SOME OF THOSE PROPERTIES DID INCLUDE PACE ASSESSMENTS AT THIS POINT THEY'RE WAITING FOR THE THE. HOMEOWNERS JUST LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY CAN PAY OFF THOSE LOANS. THROUGH THEIR INSURANCE PRODUCTS. BECAUSE THEN AND I SENSED THAT THE PACE ASSESSMENT IS SIZE TO THE VALUE OF THE HOME. SO DEPENDING ON THE HOMEOWNERS MORTGAGE INSURANCE. WOOLSEY I THINK. IT'S STILL A LITTLE TOO SOON TO TELL. AND SO I WILL GET SOME MORE INFORMATION OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR ON THIS BASIS ASSESSMENTS ON THAT PAYS LAS RESERVE IT'S A TEN MILLION DOLLAR FUND THAT'S CURRENTLY SUPPORTING TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. IN PACE ASSESSMENTS AND NOT IS DATA AS OF. LAST JUNE. I'M OUR NEXT REPORTING IS MAR IS IN MARCH AND I'LL COVERED DATA THROUGH DECEMBER. I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE OTHER INFORMATION AND IF IF NECESSARY FROM OUR OFFICE IN THAT WOULD BE GREAT I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT. WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THOSE NAM IF IF I KNOW? MOST HOMEOWNERS DON'T REASSESS AFTER THEY DO THOSE KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS AND SO. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY ACTUALLY COME IN AND SAY WE GAVE YOU THIS INSURANCE. BASED ON THE VALUE OF YOUR HOUSE NOT ON ANY ADDITIONAL BUT AGAIN THAT IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YEAH IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO KNOW I THINK HOW MUCH THAT TEN MILLION HAS BEEN EXPENDED ALREADY. SO THE FULL TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS ENCUMBERED NONE OF IT HAS BEEN DRAWN DOWN SO KATE FIVE HAS NOT RECEIVED A CLAIM TO DATE. ON THAT RESERVE NOW JUST TO CLARIFY IN THIS INFORMATION OF THE THE PRESENTATION IN FRONT OF YOU. THE RESERVE WAS DEVELOPED TO PUT FIRST MORTGAGE POSSESS MY FIRST MORTGAGE HOLDERS IN THE SAME POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH OR WITHOUT A PACE ASSESSMENT. AND SO IT'S. IT SO IT'S IT'S A REPLENISH BANK OF AMERICA YOU KNOW OR. FIRST MORTGAGE. IT ISN'T FOR THE HOMEOWNER THEMSELVES. WERE CURRENTLY DOING A RISK ASSESSMENT AROUND THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS AS IT WAS FIRST ASSESSED IT WAS. ESTABLISHES A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE FIRST SERVE FUND. SINCE IT HASN'T BEEN TAPPED TODAY AND GIVEN THE GROWING VOLUME OF PACE. WERE REASSESSING OUT AND WORKING TO GET A CONSULTANT ON BOARD ASSIST US BUT THAT. CHAIRMAN OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT MUNITIONS SPEAK. THIS ITEM. YOU CAN AYE REINFORCE ONE POINT WERE SPECIFIC TO THIS BCP WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW THE CHIEF PILOTS PROVIDE AN UNSECURED PRODUCT THERE'S NO LEAN. THERE'S NO EXTRA FEES. WERE WORKING WITH LOCAL CREDIT UNIONS THAT ARE INVESTED IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH LOCAL CONTRACTORS SO IT'S. WILL PIECES DONE SOME AMAZING THINGS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS AS FAR AS THE GROWTH IN THE MARKET THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT FINANCIAL STRUCTURE WORKING WITH. INSURED LENDING INSTITUTIONS. BETTER REGULATE AND. SECRETIVE GRAY PROGRAM. BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. FILLER NATION AS A WHOLE THIS ITEM OPEN. SO ONE OF OUR NEXT ITEM.

ENSURE THE STATE IS COMPLIANT WITH LEGISLATIVE CHANGES RELATED TO THE PORTABLE CARE ACT IN THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES PENSION REFORM ACT. AND ALLOWS THE SCO TO CONTINUE SYSTEM AUTOMATION EFFORTS FOR ACCURATELY CALCULATING OTHER POST EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. THAT WOULD HELP ELLIOTT. S. MADONNA'S WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL. FINANCE. THEY TURN IT IN HER WITH A PARTNER FINANCE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS REQUEST A CRISIS IN THE RIVERS. GOING UP AND UP PUBLIC COMMENT EMOTIONS BECAUSE SADDAM. OKAY I'LL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT QUESTION WILL THE NEW PAYROLL SYSTEM BE UNDER WAY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN COOPER MY NAME IS CHRIS MAYO AND I'M THE PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEMS PROJECT. THE PROJECT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY WE BEGAN WORK LAST SUMMER. WITH OUR BASELINE BUSINESS PROCESS DOCUMENTATION. WE IDENTIFIED ABOUT FORTY FOUR INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS PROCESSES AND WE DOCUMENTED ABOUT HALF OF THEM AS OF TODAY. WE HAVE A LONG RUNWAY THOUGH YOU KNOW WE HAVE. FIRST REALLY GO THROUGH THIS BUSINESS PROCESS DOCUMENTATION THEM GOING TO BE LOOKING AT BUSINESS PROCESS RE ENGINEERING. CHANGING THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS AND THEN WE START WRITING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEW SYSTEM. SO WE REALLY DON'T ANTICIPATE HAVING A NEW SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. INSTEAD WE ARE. JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A TOTALLY NEW SYSTEM IS THAT CORRECT. I'M I DON'T KNOW YET WE HAVE ABOUT. SEVEN DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES THAT WE'RE GOING TO ANALYZE ONE OF THEM IS. ESSENTIALLY USING THE SAME MAINFRAME BASED SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY BUT CREATING MODERN INTERFACES TO IT FOR THE EMPLOYEES AND THE. YOUR OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE INTERFACE WITH. BUT I I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER YET I PROBABLY WON'T FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS THAT THAT'S WHEN WE'LL FINISH ARE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS AND WILL HAVE A AN IDEA OF WHAT DIRECTION WE WILL TAKE. IT VERY WELL COULD BE A COMPLETELY NEW SYSTEM. IT COULD BE AN OFF THE SHELF SYSTEM IT COULD BE A CUSTOM DEVELOPED SYSTEM. WE JUST DON'T KNOW TODAY. HAVING SOME EXPERIENCE WITH. THE CHALLENGES OF. BRINGING IN A NEW IT SYSTEM. USING. STATE PROCESSES I'M IS THIS A NEW. AB PROCESS EXIST THEN NEW PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR. DETERMINING WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AB DAY. OF THE SCO. YEAH AND I AND I'M I'M I'M SOMEWHERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND I REMEMBER AND NUMBER HAVE ITERATIONS OF A PROJECT THAT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT'S KIND OF BEEN SHELVED AND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW. I'M. YES OR NO. WELL IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME KIND OF PROJECT WE ARE LOOKING AT REPLACING ARE YOU PAYROLL SYSTEM. WE ARE TAKING A NEW APPROACH. USING THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE MIX WE STARTED WITH STAGE ONE AND WE'RE WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH FROM THERE WE DIDN'T TRY TO PICK UP WHERE THE LAST PROJECT LEFT OFF THAT WAS MY QUESTION YOU SAID IT MUCH BETTER THAN I. WHITEST BUT WHAT ONE OF THE BIG BIG LESSONS LEARNED WAS WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DOCUMENT OUR PROCESSES. AND LOOK AT WAYS TO. STANDARDIZE AND SIMPLIFY PAYROLL FOR CALIFORNIA BEFORE WE MOVE INTO FIGURING OUT WHAT TO BUY. TO TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IS GREAT AND THEN. ARE THERE ANY OTHER EXAMPLES IN OTHER STATES OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE AS BEACON OF AN ORGANIZATION OR AS COMPLEX SEVEN ORGANIZATION IT PAYROLL WEISS. I'M I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE. ACTUALLY THE CANADIAN PAYROLL SYSTEM NAME PHOENIX. THEY ARE NEARLY EQUIVALENT TO S. AND THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THERE. ATTEMPT. THEY HAVE JUST AS COMPLEX A. STRUCTURE A BARGAINING UNIT AGREEMENTS ON LAWS JUST LIKE WE DO. MIGHT ALSO BEEN LOOKING AT OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE NEW ZEALAND WHO ALSO HAVE YOU KNOW SIMILAR LESSONS AND CHALLENGES THAT CALIFORNIA FACED. AND WE BRING ALL THOSE TO THE TABLE YOU KNOW WHERE GREATER LOOKING AROUND NOT JUST OTHER STATES BECAUSE. NOBODY COMPARES TO CALIFORNIA RIGHT ARE OURS IS BY FAR THE SINGLE LARGEST AND MOST COMPLEX. GOOD THAT'S GREAT AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT ON. THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT OTHER MODELS AND THAT WE'VE KIND OF SCRAPPED THE OLD AND MOVED FORWARD WITH A NEW. ABUSING THE NEW. PROPOSED CHANGES THAT HAVE THAT HAVE COME OUT OF. THAT. TECHNOLOGY. AND DEPARTMENT IT'S NINE AGENCY ANYMORE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATED. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ALTHOUGH NOBODY PUBLIC COMMENT WE WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. CAL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE RECOMMENDATION IS OVERSIGHT OF OPEN. YEAH. A MISSILE WAS UNDER SEVEN. FISCAL IMPLEMENTATION. THE AS HEROES REQUESTING INCREASE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE S. USE CONTROL AGENCY FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN THE FISCAL SYSTEM. THE RESOURCES WILL ALLOW THE SCO TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS AS OUTLINED WITHIN THE RECENTLY RELEASED S. P. R. SEVEN. FOR LIKE TO BE AND TO RESPOND TO THE COMMENTS OUTLINED IN TODAY'S AGENDA. BOB SCO SUPPORTS THE LEN RECOMMENDATION THAT DISCOUNT CONTINUE TO COUNT ALL COSTS RELATED TO COMPLETING THE ORIGINAL SCOPE OF THE PROJECT. INCLUDING BRINGING ON ALL REMAINING DEPARTMENTS AND THE SCO SCO CONTROL FUNCTIONALITY. THAT SAID WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CAN BE DONE WITH US YOU KNOW PERTAINING DIRECT FUNDING AND REPORTING OUR PROJECT COST VISCO. FOR INCLUSION IN ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE. WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ASSERT THAT ANNUAL FUNDING OF SCO WORK DOES HAVE A DETRIMENTAL AFFECTS. SUCH AS WORKLOAD INVOLVED IN PREPARING AND PRESENTING ANNUAL BCP'S. POSITION CONTROL WORKLOAD. AND POTENTIAL TURNOVER AND HARD TO HIGHER POSITIONS. AYE AND THIS TO BE DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUNDING. SCO PREFERS FUNDING AS REQUESTED AND WILL HAPPILY COMPLY WITH ANY AND ALL REPORTING AT THAT MAY BE DESIRED BY THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE. FINALLY WE NOTE THAT THIS BCP INCLUDES FUNDING TO SUPPORT TWO DISTINCT FUNCTIONS. THE BCP SUPPORTS BUT THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED WITHIN THE LA GOES RECENTLY RELEASED. OR REPORT WHICH IS ON FRIDAY. AND THE SCO VENDOR MANAGEMENT GROUP. WHICH IS AN EXISTING AND ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS COST OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM. IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING AND THEY'LL KNOW IF YOU CAN CUT ME IF I'M WRONG. THAT THERE ARE NO CONCERNS RAISED IN THE SUPPORT OF THE ONGOING RESOURCES FOR THE VENDOR MANAGEMENT GROUP. THEREFORE IT THE ULTIMATE DECISION IS TO FUND THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS WE RESPECTFUL RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE VENDOR MANAGEMENT PORTION OF THE B. C. P.. P. EVALUATED SEPARATELY AND FOR APPROVAL IN ITS ENTIRETY. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS KATHIE LEE OUT PARTNER BUSINESS EXECUTIVE AND IF YOU'D YOU CAN PROVIDE THE STATUS OF THE FISCAL PROJECT AND PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION. OKAY JUST SO YOU OF TRANSFORMATION OR LIGHTLY SO BE. MORE LIKELY FALL INTO A LARGER AS I I SO QUICK QUESTION ABOUT SAMIR HARD HIGHER POSITIONS WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE. SO IF THE POSITIONSIF WE RECEIVE ANNUAL FUNDING. AT YOU KNOW. TO HIRE ALL THE POSITIONS. A IT MAY BE HARD TO TO HIRE THEM BECAUSE THE FUNDING WON'T BE ONGOING. SO THEY MADE IT YOU KNOW FOLKS MAY NOT. BE WILLING TO. TOP FILL IN. ATTEMPT AT THE YEAH. MR TO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FOR SO DECIDED COLLEAGUES. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THIS IS HAS BEEN. I THINK TO SAY KILEY A BIT OF A DISASTER I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE A FUTURE HEARING ON IT BUT I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF HIGH LEVEL QUESTIONS. START THE CONVERSATION. A THIS PROJECT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. IT'S NOW TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN YEARS LATER WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME AT THIS POINT FOR WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE COMPLETED. CURRENTLY THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION PORTION IS EXPECTED TO BE FULLY ALIVE BY JULY TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT IS OUT THERE LOWER SCOPE THEM WHAT'S ORIGINALLY PLANNED WITH SO COMPLETELY ON FISCAL. THE GOAL FOR SCO TO BE COMPLETELY ENTRE SCOWL WOULD BE JULY TWENTY NINE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND HOW MUCH CERTAINTY FEEL THAT THAT DATE IS SET. THAT'S A GOOD SOLID PRODUCTIVITY. SO. SIXTEEN YEARS LATER. WE READ WITH A VENDOR CAME ONBOARD IN JULY TWENTY TWELVE SO FROM THE TIME THAT NICKNAME BUT YES CORRECT FROM A. FROM A DISCOVERY PERSPECTIVE THE RATE THE WRITING IN THE U. REQUIREMENTS YES IT'S TAKEN NOT LONG BEEN AGAIN I MINOR CENTERS ON A YOU FEW COME FOR ALL TO THE LATER IN THE PROCESS I JOIN. THAT THE SCOUT TEAM FROM SCO'S PERSPECTIVE IN JULY TWENTY TEN. SO I'VE BEEN HERE TWENTY CONCEIVED EVERY OKAY. BOB LET ME ASK JUST BIG PICTURE ON THE BUDGET SO. THOUGH I THINK LAST YEAR THE STATE AUDITOR SAID THAT THIS PROJECT WAS A QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS. UNDER BUDGET SO WE HAD TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO IT WHERE'S THE BUDGET AT THIS POINT IN WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING. BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO. WHY WE SHOULD DEFER THOSE TO FISK OUT AND FINANCE BUT AS IN LIEU OF THAT? AND ELLIE OWES REPORT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAPTURE ALL OF OUR COSTS FROM SCO AND OUR AND OUR EFFORT OR IN THE FISCAL INTEGRATED SOLUTION AND TECH COUNT PROBLEMS. SO WE COULD HAVE A GOOD PICTURE AT THE END. OKAY TO EVEN ANSWER THIS POINT FROM FINANCE AND WHAT THE BUDGETS GONNA LOOK LIKE HOW MUCH AND WE SPENT SO FAR WOULD YOU PROTECTING. COURTESY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE WOULD HAVE TO DEFER DRIVE OUR FOLKS ON THE FISCAL ASSIGNMENT SO WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE. AND THEY'RE NOT HERE. OKAY. CAN WE GET THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE ARE WE DO HAVE A HEARING ON THIS TODAY SELL BE GREAT AND OTHERS. I THINK I THINK ONE OF THE IT INSIDE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO THIS. SELECT ANALYSTS ON THERE WAS A NEW SPECIAL. NOW IT MUM. MIND IT WAS MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TOTAL PROJECT COST THAT BROUGHT IT TO NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SCOTT PROJECT. AS WAS NOTED THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT ON IT ONE OF OUR CONCERNS WHERE THAT. SIGNIFICANT COST RELATED THE FISCAL PROJECT WERE ACTUALLY PLACED OUTSIDE OF THAT MOST NOTABLY BEING THE COST AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE RELATED TO THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION. AS WITH NOTED WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE VENDOR MANAGEMENT PIECE OF THE PCP THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE SEE IS UNRELATED. BUT FOR THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION WITH THE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN COST THAT WE THINK SHOULD ACTUALLY BE ATTRIBUTED. TO THE FISCAL PROJECT THAT CURRENTLY ARE NOT AND THERE'S OTHER COSTS THAT WE RAISED IN OUR REPORT THAT ARE ALSO SORT OF. PUSHED OUTSIDE THE PROJECT AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ALLOW FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE ACCOUNTING OF ALL OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THE FISCAL PROJECT OKAY BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET EVEN THE IT DOES YOU DON'T YOU SAID YOU DONT THERE'S BEEN A SEVEN THOUGHT ON THIS. BUT THAT STILL HASN'T COME TOGETHER. AS REFLECTED IN THE S. P. ARE THE TOTAL COST IS NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT HAS NOT BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR IS THE COST OF THESE OTHER PIECES? THAT UNDER THE SPR WOULD COME LATER. OKAY I YOU KNOW I JUST NOTE FOR FOR COLLEAGUES OF MY GUESSES EACH RIVER INDIVIDUAL IMPACTS ON THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE IS PROBABLY LESS EVERY YEAR THAN THE COST DIFFERENCE IN THIS PROJECT AND SO THIS IS IN PART WHY. I CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS IN THIS AREA. I KNOW THAT. OBVIOUSLY DALY OWES MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OF HOW WE HANDLE THIS AND SCO BELIEVES THAT THAT MIGHT SLOW THINGS DOWN LIKE A YOU KNOW FOR MY PERSPECTIVE I WANT THIS PROJECT ON. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ON BUDGET AYE AND I'M HEARING THAT IF WE. APPLY MORE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHAT HAPPENS IT WILL SLOW THE PROJECT DOWN IS THAT TRULY. THE CHOICE THAT WE'RE FACED WITH OR IS THERE WAY FOR US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS PROJECT DONE ON TIME. WITH THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE NEED TO MAKE US FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WE'RE SPENDING MONEY CORRECTLY. YEAH. ARE LUIS ALEJO AB ONE OF OUR CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL IS ENSURING THAT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. EVENTUALLY FULLY TRANSITIONS TO THE FISCAL PROJECT OF IMAGE AND UNDER THE S. P. ARE THERE IS A FINITE CONCLUSION DAY OF JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN HASN'T EXPLAINED GIVEN THE TIMELINE FOR THE SPLIT EP THE FULL TRANSITION OF AT THE ON TO FIFTH CAL. I WILL HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT I'M AS CERTAIN THAT WE FEEL AN ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT ITS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE. THIS DEPARTMENT FINANCE EXCUSE ME TO VALLEY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. POWELL SCO'S MAKING PROGRESS ON COMPLETING THOSE ASPECTS OF CAL I'M ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT THAT QUARTERLY AND REPORTING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MAYBE TOO ONEROUS AND PERHAPS MAY DELEGATE TOO MUCH CONTROL TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO AS A RESPONSE TO THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THAT LANGUAGE BE. I'M STRICKEN AND IN FACT BOAT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO COME BACK ON ANNUAL BASIS AND THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM TO THE LEGISLATURE TO MOVE FORWARD INTO. OUR INTENT IS NOT TO DISRUPT THE PROCESS AT ALL BUT TO PROVIDE ENHANCED OVERSIGHT ON FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE. UP INTO THE CHAIR WINNER WE EXPECTED TO DO A FULLER DIVE INTO. THIS FISCAL PROJECT. SOMETIME IN APRIL OKAY SO I I GUESS MY QUESTION NOW YOU IS. YOU'RE SEEING HOW THEY'RE A CEO REPORT BACK YEARLY AT THAT. THAT ENOUGH FOR MANY YEARS LONGTIME WERE. PARTY SO FAR INTO THIS SO. THAT ARE BUILDING MY CONCERN IS HEARING THAT NOW. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS RELATED TO BUT THE FUNDING CAN OF THE FUNDING IS THAT'S AN EXCELLENT TOOL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO. OUR SITES OVERSIGHT OVER THE PROJECT FOR LARA LARGE PROJECTS IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVEN REQUIRE THE PROJECT TO REPORT BACK MORE FREQUENTLY THAT PERHAPS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS ON A MORE. KIND OF INFORMAL NOTE IN TERMS THAT I'M BUT STOPPED LEVEL THAT'S NOT NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN REQUIRED. OF THE FIFTH UP PROJECT OR SOMETHING WE RECOMMENDED BUT IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE COULD IMPLEMENT IF IT WISHES BOOK ASSUME THE COST OVERRUNS IN THE TRACK RECORD OF THIS PROJECT. OBVIOUSLY IT MAYBE IT DOES CONSIDER. MORE ATTENTION. THEN JUST THAT. AND THE FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE THE MULTI YEAR FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT WITH THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT DOES REQUIRE THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AND THAT QUARTERLY VERIFICATION OF PROGRESS. ARM BEFORE THE NEXT YEAR IF I CAN REQUEST GOING TO GET A COPY OF THE SEVEN ON ITS IT YOU'VE DONE. SO I COULD. SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS NOW I. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE I THINK FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF OVERSIGHT. IT CLEARLY OVER SIXTEEN YEARS THERE'S NOT BEEN ENOUGH AND. FROM ADMINISTRATION TO ADMINISTRATION REGARDLESS OF WHO THE GOVERNOR'S BENNETT WHO THE CONTROLLERS SPENT. THIS IS A PROJECT THAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO. GOVERNMENT IS NOT ABLE TO GET A HANDLE ON AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALMOST A BILLION DOLLAR COST. A SO I AT LOVE TO LOVE TO SEE THOSE AUDITS AND AND I'D LIKE TO BE BRIEFED HOPEFULLY BEFORE HAND OF OF WHAT THE PLAN IS TO. GIVE US SOME CERTAINTY THAT. THAT. WE ARE USING THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS WELL. BRITNEY THEM WEEKLY FOR THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE YEAH I'LL BE HONEST IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE LENGTH OF TIME. IS FORCING APPEARS BUDGETS HIM BEING ON THE COMMITTEE SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THIS IS PROBABLY THE. MORE THE LONGER PROJECTS THAT IT HAS GONE ON SO. I DO THINK IT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTENTION. IT ACCOUNTABILITY. TO SHUT OFF ACCOUNTABLE JUST. NO WRITING A BLANK CHECK AND YOU'RE SAYING TWENTY TWENTY ONE CORRECT. FOR FULL OF THE FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION BUT. THEY'RE THEY'RE NO GUARANTEES YOU KNOW SO THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT THAT. IN LIGHT OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS THAT I. DOES RAISE SOME CONCERNS IS COVERAGE OF A QUESTION. WELL I WAS JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS. REQUEST FOR POSITIONS AND. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ITS EIGHT AND THEN IT GOES UP TO THIRTY AND THEN IT'S ALMOST FIFTY AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THIS IS ON A DATA INPUT. ISSUE OR IS THIS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEMS ISSUE BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY DEVELOPED. SEVEN JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OF WHAT THE REQUEST IS TO GET BACK TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED BEFORE. YES SO YOU ARE CORRECT ARE A REQUEST FOR IT. ADDITIONAL STOPPING IS DUE TO THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION AND THE NATURE OF THE WORK THAT IS CAUSED BY THE INJURY TO SOLUTION. UP AS HE STATED OF S. A WILL NOT BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED INTO FIFTH GALA UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. JULY TWENTY NINETEEN INTRODUCES PARALLEL PROCESSING WITH ONE POINT OF ENTRY SO YOU ENTER THE DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENTS OFFICE GUY WILL CONTINUE TO UTILIZE FOR SCOTT AS THEIR MAIN SYSTEM. AN S. YOU'LL CONTINUE UTILIZE THE LEGACY SYSTEM AS THEIR MAIN SYSTEM WITH BOTH. EMPLOYERS BEAT INTERFACE TO THE OTHER AND THAT CREATES A LOT OF RECONCILIATIONS BY MAKING SURE ALL THE TRANSACTIONS ARE POSTING ON A REGULAR BASIS THE NORMAL WORKLOAD IS STILL THERE BUT SOMEONE NOW HAS TO RECONCILE THAT THE TRANSACTIONS. AND THE LEDGER ACTUALLY BALANCE SO WE CAN HAVE A STATE Y. LEDGER OUT OF THIS GAL TO BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS IS BEHAVING IN THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BEFORE WE ACTUALLY CUT OVER THE TRUE BOOK OF RECORD INTO FISCAL. RIGHT SO SO IT IT MAY BE I THINK THAT THE IDEA BEHIND FISCAL IS THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO UPDATE. THAT THE SYSTEM SO THAT. EVERYBODY IS USING THE SAME SYSTEM IN INPUTTING THE DATA IN THE SAME AYE SO. I'M ASSUMING THESE ARE TEMPORARY POSITIONS AT SOME POINT YEAH. BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO CREATE EFFICIENCIES NOT CREATE MORE WORK FOR READY TO DO IT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS. RATHER THAN HAVING DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN THE PAST. YES THERE IS I'M THERE SOME LIMITED TERM BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME. PERMANENT RESOURCES THAT WILL YOU KNOW BE NEEDED. AND THE PERMANENT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED I'M JUST TRYING TO. TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT YOU GO FROM EIGHT HOW YOU CREATE EFFICIENCIES THROUGH A NEW PLATFORM AND THEN END UP HAVING TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE. AND MAYBE THIS IS THE SUBJECT FOR THE LONGER HEARING BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IT AT SOME POINT. YEAR IN THE IDEAS YOU'RE CREATING THE EFFICIENCIES. GOT IT PAY FOR ONE OF FOUR PARTNERS. IT'S ALREADY BEEN. AUTHORITIES ARE FOR YOU. YEAH. HARLEM. BEING A PART. OPERATE. HAVEN'T GOTTEN. FULL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MOST OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE. AND THEN HAVE HIM. CONTROLS. FOR TRYING TO BUILD THOSE TWO TOGETHER. A FACT THAT WE DIDN'T GO. FIRST QUICKLY CONTROL FUNCTIONALITY THAT ARE OPEN RECORD MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR HER TO GET ON. WHEN WHEN TRAINS ALREADY YEAH GO. TO ANOTHER QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING THAT PROJECT. SHOULD BE. SLX DIFFICULT AWARE TUNING INFORMATION NOW SCO. IMPRINT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW. WHAT WE PROVIDING? IN PUTTING IT AND. FOR. WELL BECAUSE YOU LIKE HAVE TO KILL. HALF PART OF THIS. AND. THE PART THAT HAVE ARE PEOPLE FROM. WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING? BILL. EVERYTHING THAT'S WHAT CLEVELAND'S ROLLING UP BUT ONLY TO A POINT. IT'S NOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN TAKE THAT IN FOR. ROLL IT INTO OUR. FOR. IF I MAY FOR. MISTER CHAIRMAN I PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONTACTS PRESSURE. THE ORIGINAL INTENT REGARDING THE ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS WITH TO REALLY BRING THEM ONLINE ALL AT ONCE. SUPPOSED TO BE ONLINE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN HOWEVER THERE WAS PERSISTENT CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE TESTING OF THESE FUNCTIONS. AS A RESULT OF THOSE CHALLENGES S. P. ARE SUMMONED HIM THE LATEST PLAN IF YOU DO INTRODUCES A NEW APPROACH FOR THAT RATHER THAN COMING ONLINE. IN WHOLE KIND OF ON A SINGLE DAY INTEGRATED SOLUTION BUILD INTERFACES BETWEEN BOTH I FEEL THE LEGACY SYSTEMS AND FIFTH OUT. AND THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HAS FACED IN THE PAST REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY OF THE SCALE. THIS IS REALLY AN INTRODUCTION FOR THE BALLOT IN THE SYSTEM THE INTENT MEAN WHEN SCO WITH COMPETENT IN THE PERFORMANCE THE FIFTH OUT THEN THEY WOULD TRANSITION OVER. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S NO. IN THE FDR THERE'S NO SPECIFIC DATE FOR WHEN. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WILL ACCOUNT FOR THOSE ASSURANCES AND WHEN I FEEL FULLY TRANSITIONS OVER TO THE AFGHAN. AS WITH THE ORIGINAL VISION BUT WELL IN READING THIS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THEY'RE UP FORTY ONE ONGOING POSITION SOSUS. YEAH YOU READ ALL THE REQUEST AND HIS MIND NUMBING. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND RIGHT NOW THE TRACK RECORD IS NOT THAT GOOD. SO SO SO WHAT POINT DO WE JUST. STOP WRITTEN. IN CHANGECOURSE BECAUSE WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING FOR SAID APPEARING GO AND APPROVED IS MAKING SENSE. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS FOR THAT CAN HEREBY HERE APPROVALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE TRACK HOW IT'S MOVING FORWARD AND WHETHER ANY ONGOING POSITIONS ARE VALLEY THAT WE CAN IN THE FUTURE DECISION BASED ON BUT EVEN RECORD EVEN OVER PRIOR YEARS IT DOES COME BACK EVERY YEAR SO. THERE HAS BEEN THAT IN EFFECT. A YEAR BY YEAR APPROVAL RIGHT NOW IS NAY ONGOING ALL THIS TIME. IN A STILL HASN'T CORRECTED WITH THE ISSUES. SO WHY WILL WE CONTINUE GOING YEAR BY YEAR THE COMES BACK. TO LEGISLATURE EVERY YEAR SO. WHY WE LOVE THAT TO CONTINUE I DON'T I REALLY HAD A GOOD REASON? FOR ALLOWING THAT. ACTUALLY. THE LOGISTICS. PROVEN HE ARE AND SO THOSE ARE THE PROJECT PLAN THAT HISTORICALLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROVED THE PLAN AND NOT REQUIRED FIFTH OUT TO COME BACK AND LAST THERE'S A CHANGE AND SO. THE. USUALLY IT'S BEEN CUT OF A FEW YEARS THE LAST TIME THE FIST CAO KY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WITHIN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. IF I COULD JUST WOULD SUGGEST HOW LUDICROUS IT SILENCED US BECAUSE WE'RE APPROVING. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY IN YOU'RE SAYING WELL WE HAVE AND YOU HAVE AN HAD COME BACK TO US AND YET WE'RE NOT GETTING THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT. AND MY GUESS IS IF THE START OF THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE TECHNOLOGIES PEARLY OUTDATED AT THIS POINT RIGHT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S PRETTY MIND BOGGLING. SO I GUESS WE'RE GONNA TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT PUTTING THIS IN THE LARGER. IT'S GOT THIS QUESTION OGLE AND OPEN TO PUBLIC COMMENT. ANY WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. OKAY I'LL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. AND WILL THE ITEM OPEN THIS RECOMMENDATION IF I COULD JUST MAKE ONE FINAL COMMENT ANOTHER LOT OF DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS. CEO IS ONE OF THEM AT THE END THE DAY I'M LOOKING TO FINANCE OR SOMEONE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION TO SAY WHO. SORT OF WHO'S IN CHARGE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE WHO'S ULTIMATELY ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS HOW ARE WE AS LEGISLATORS SUPPOSED TO PRY PROVIDE APPROPRIATE. OVERSIGHT RIGHT THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NOW THEY WERE ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS PROJECT. FEELS A LITTLE INSANE TO ME SO SORRY THAT MY LANGUAGE IS PROBABLY A LITTLE STRONGER THAN. I TYPICALLY DISCUSSING SEEN THIS COMMITTEE BUT BUT FROM OUR STANDPOINT IT'S JUST. DIFFICULT FOR US TO HAVE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS. I THINK EXCUSE ME KNITTING HARD PARTNER FINANCE I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT ON THE. ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORTIVE OF THE. ANY AUGMENTATION DOES HAVE DOT PROVISIONAL BRIAN WHICH REQUIRING THE QUARTERLY VERIFICATION OF SATISFACTORY PROGRESS TOWARDS PREDETERMINED MILESTONES AS SPELLED OUT IN S. B. R. SEVEN. ABOUT THAT COULD GIVE YOU SOME OF THAT I CONFIDENCE IN REGARDS TO BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT APPROPRIATE FOR PROGRESS. AND IN REGARDS TO THE. THE DELEGATED AUTHORITY ONLY UNDER THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND THE CONCERNS THAT LEO RAISED. A FINANCE AND CONTROLLER HAVE AGREED TO REVISIONS TO THE PROFESSIONAL LANGUAGE ADDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY VERIFICATION PROGRESS. THAT INFORMATION WAS SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF REALLY ARE IN FEBRUARY. AND THAT'S JUST HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. BUT. OKAY. SO AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTEEN YEARS FINALLY DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES AND IS INVOLVED. I JUST ASKING THE QUESTION IT'S IT'S AGAIN IT'S MIND BOGGLING THAT THAT THIS HAS I BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN IN FAULT I THINK IT'S MORE OF. IN IN OUR PROPOSAL WHERE ARE INCLUDING THEM IN PART OF THOSE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS SO. IF THE INTENT WAS ALWAYS THIS ONGOING DISCUSSION WITH. QUARTERLY VERIFICATION OF SATISFACTORY PROGRESS. WELL LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT DISCUSSION ON THE. WE DO. YOU'RE ONE OF NEXT ITEM. MISTRUST Y. MISTER CHOI. YEAH I JUST TUR WALKED IN AND. JUST LISTENING TAILEND OF IT AS SAW HUGE UNDERTAKING IS LIKE EXPRESSION MINDBOGGLING. STILL. ARE AYE OUT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION IS SESSA. THE FISCAL SYSTEM IS THAT IT CUSTOM OFF THE SHELF FOR ENTERPRISE SO WE SOCIAL PLANNING. IS THIS A CUSTOMIZED TO ADD JUST A PHONE OUR STATE DON'T WASH OFF THE SHELF WAS JUST OF IMPLEMENTING. NOW. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE LANGUAGE OF WHICH IS THE CASE HERE. CUSTOMIZED APPROACH WHERE AM. A NEWLY DEVELOPED DEVELOPED ó OFF THE SHELF WAS SOMEBODY HAS ALREADY TESTED. LOUIS MY LOOK AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS AN EXISTING. EXISTING TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN MODIFIED TO FIT CALIFORNIA'S REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT DO YOU KNOW WHAT A AGENCIES SO AND AT THE STATE OF MIND OF USED TO THE. SYSTEM THAT THE WE ARE.
