CARBURETOR SENATE BILL ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE BY CENTER STERN AND ACTIVATING ANIMALS THIS KAMLAGER. GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS HEY THAT'S BE ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE SEEKS TO ADDRESS. RISKS POSED TO CALIFORNIANS BY WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING AND TRADE AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND BIODIVERSITY. LIKE SARS AND MURDERS POSTED NINETEEN HAS ONCE AGAIN BROUGHT ATTENTION TO HOW ANIMALS ARE HUNTED TRANSPORTED AND SOLD. THOUGH THE EXACT ANIMAL PATHWAY FOR THE HUMAN CASE THE FIRST HUMAN CASE IS STILL BEING TO. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE A BILL FOCUSED ON WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING IN TRADE PROVIDE THE TOOLS NECESSARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH. AND WILDLIFE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM PUT DISEASE ANIMALS AND TO PROTECT AN IMPERILED ANIMALS FROM PRACTICES DETRIMENTAL TO THEIR SPECIES. THERE ARE SOME PROVISIONS IN STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATION THAT SEEKS TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ANIMALS. THERE ARE HOWEVER GAPS IN THIS FRAMEWORK. IN RESPONSE SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE GIVE CDFW AUTHORITY ON THE WRITTEN FINDING OF THE CDFW DIRECTOR TO PRO ACTIVELY SUSPEND THE AUTHORIZATION TO IMPORT A WILD ANIMAL. SHOULD THERE BE A SCIENTIFICALLY DETERMINE LINKED TO AN OUTBREAK LIKE COVE IT. WHERE WILD ANIMAL TO HUMAN OR DO NOT A TRANSMISSION IS FOUND TO BE THE SOURCE. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE REVAMPS CDFW THE CONSISTING AUTHORITY TO PUBLISH AND LIST OF ANIMALS FROM THE STATE REQUIRES THAT ANY POTENTIAL LIST OF BANNED WILD ANIMALS BE DEVELOPED A REGULATION TO ENSURE FOR PUBLIC INPUT. AND PROCESS TRANSPARENCY. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE ALSO SEEKS TO PROTECT CERTAIN AFRICAN SPECIES FROM TROPHY HUNTING BY PROHIBITING THE POSSESSION OF NEW TROPHIES IN THE STATE. SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER SENATOR STERN'S BILL TWO YEARS AGO THAT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR MANY OF US SUPPORTED IT. AN AFRICAN LION AFRICAN LIONS LIFE SHOULDN'T BE AND IT SHOULDN'T HIM TO BE A DECORATION ON SOMEONE'S WALL. AND THIS BAN WOULD APPLY TO A NUMBER OF ENDANGERED OR THREATENED ANIMALS INCLUDING AFRICAN ELEPHANTS LIONS RHINOS LEOPARDS PANGOLINS BABOONS AND CERTAIN THE BREATH. THE AUTHOR REPEATEDLY HAS AMENDED THE BILL TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPONENTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THERE WAS KAMLAGER MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YEAH THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS- THE AUTHOR MAY HAVE MADE AMENDMENTS% BUT HE STILL HASN'T DEALT WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WHICH IS THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY UNENFORCEABLE. AND THAT IS WHY THE GOVERNOR PREVIOUSLY VETOED IT. BECAUSE YOU ARE MAKING SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY THINGS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED- BY THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT- SO THE BILL STILL UNENFORCEABLE AND LET ME BRING UP ANOTHER CONSTITUENCY THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR FISHING GAME WARDENS. WHO ARE ALREADY COMPLETELY OVERTAXED IN THE STATE. WE DO NOT HAVE THEY ARE SPREAD SO THIN. WITH ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AND MEANWHILE OUR OWN WILDLIFE. HERE IN THIS STATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN NEED OF THE GREATEST PROTECTION. IN OUR GAME WARDENS TO HELP ENFORCE THOSE LAWS. I RIGHT NOW IN COLUSA COUNTY I HAVE ONE GAME WARDEN TO COVER THAT ENTIRE COUNTY IN THAT ENTIRE AREA IN DEALING WITH POACHING. AND OTHER ACTIVITIES IT DID OCCUR THERE MEANWHILE WE'RE GOING TO NOW FOCUS ON ICONIC AFRICAN SPECIES. HEARING CALIFORNIAN WHILE WHILE POACHING IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN OUR BACKYARD. AND QUITE SIMPLY THIS IS A MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLAR MANDATE ON THEM THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE MANPOWER TO ENFORCE AND TO GO pOUT AND DO INSTEAD WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING OUR FISHING GAME WARDEN SO THEY CAN DO THE JOB THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. FOR OUR CALIFORNIA WILDLIFE. NOT ADDING SOME NEW MANDATE THAT AGAIN IS COMPLETELY UNENFORCEABLE. SO I'D ASK YOU MEMBERS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS DON'T RESPOND TO THIS. JUST EMOTIONALLY WE ALL OBVIOUSLY. FEEL FOR THESE. THESE SPECIES AS WELL WE SEE. DIFFERENT ABUSES- BUT WE'VE GOT OUR WILDLIFE RIGHT HERE AT HOME THAT NEED TO BE PROTECTED. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. FOR OUR FISHING GAME WARDENS WHO HAVE WHO HAVE THAT DUTY TO PROTECT THE SPECIES THANK YOU. IT WAS GALLAGHER. MISTER COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE BUT CURRENTLY FACING DIFFICULT CHALLENGES HERE IN CALIFORNIA PANDEMIC ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY MASSIVE UNEMPLOYMENT HERE THEY ARE TODAY VOTING ON A BILL WHICH WILL IMPACT THE ECONOMY OF NATIONS THROUGHOUT AFRICA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BILL TO BAN THE USE OF COBALT WHICH IS USED AND WHAT YOUR VEHICLES THAT LITTLE BLACK KIDS MINE IN AFRICA BUT THIS. I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE WET MARKET AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW A MET WHAT MARKETS ARE THINK ABOUT LITTLE SAIGON'S THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO- ARE CHINATOWNS THIS BILL IMPACT EVERYTHING FROM ASIAN MINORITY FIRST MARKETS TO RED LOBSTER RESTAURANTS. A FISHING GAME CAN FORCE IT TO TALK ABOUT WE LIVE MARKETS WHAT MARKETS THINK ABOUT OUR API COMMUNITY YOU GO TO CHINESE RESTAURANT IT REGULATES THAT. THAT'S WITHIN THE BIG ISSUE THAT WITH THIS WAS PUT IN FOR THAT- THING OFF FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND WHY NOW. FISHING GAME IS OVER BURDENED THEY HAVE FOREIGN OFFICERS. BETTER TO PROTECT THE STATE MOSSOS OFFICERS ARE TIED UP DOING MARIJUANA ENFORCEMENT. A COASTAL ENFORCEMENT STILL THE ACTUAL NUMBERS. WHEN OFFICE GOTTEN ACTUALLY PURSUE THIS IS IT IS VERY LOW YOU'RE ADDING ALL OF THAT OUT NOT ADDING ADDITIONAL BODIES. AND REALLY THE BIG THING I'M NOT I'M NOT A BIG HUNTER BUT HERE YOU HAVE COUNTRIES FROM AFRICA SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT WE WANT THE MONEY THE MONEY HELPS OUR PEOPLE. THE TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMY. AND IT JUST IT JUST ON. ME THAT THE PEOPLE. THEY THE SIERRA CLUB MORE WORK ABOUT HIS. THEY ARE KIDS OVER THERE THEY'RE HARVESTING THE COBALT BATTERIES THAT'S A REAL ISSUE. BECAUSE NEVER TALK ABOUT THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT LITTLE BLACK KIDS OVER THERE. THE CARE ABOUT THE ANIMALS. LET'S TAKE CARE OF THOSE KIDS FIRST THEY'RE ALL DRIVING EV'S. I'M NOT NOT BANG ON TV'S BUT CALIFORNIA'S MOST EV'S. IN THE COUNTRY. AND 30% OF THE COBALT IS MINED IN THE CONGO IN SOUTH AFRICA. SO IF YOU WANT TO CARE ABOUT SOMETHING CARE ABOUT THOSE KIDS COOKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS SO IS THERE REALLY IS A REAL NEED. ESPECIALLY THE WET MARKETS MILLSTONE AT LAST I WAS IN THERE LAST YEAR TO IN THIS YEAR ON THE WEB MARKETS. SO DO WE HAVE TIME FOR FIFTY WATER FISHING GAME OFFICERS GOING IN. TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT FISH OR LOBSTER. OR CRAB IN YOUR TANK AND RUNNING REPORT. THAT TIES UP OFFICERS WHO WHAT ABOUT THE FRONT LINES. DOING WITH COASTAL POLLUTION. WATER POLLUTION FROM CANNABIS AND OTHER THINGS. SO I REFER ONE DON'T WANT FISHING GAME WHO ARE VERY SHORT RIGHT NOW. IN A RESTAURANT I DON'T THINK THE PUBLIC ONCE IN A RESTAURANT. THEY HAVE HIGHER EXPECTATIONS. SO TO ME FOR SOME REASON FARMING LIST YOU KNOW. START CARE ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES IN HIS LIFE. AND OTHER THINGS SO- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NOTE ON THIS. THERE WAS COOPER IS BOERNER HORVATH IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YES GOOD MORNING COLLEAGUES AND MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES OF. VOICE SOME CONCERNS BUT I HAVE TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THE FOCUS OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE. IS ON DISEASED ANIMALS. NOT HEALTHY ONE. ALSO IF THE SANCTUARY WANTS TO BRING AN ANIMAL SUFFERING FROM A TREATABLE. OR NON CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE A LOT OF THAT. THE GOAL OF ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE IS TO SURE INSURE THAT DISEASED ANIMALS. DO NOT SPREAD THIS DISEASE IN THE STATE. IT'S THAT SIMPLE COLLEAGUES SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE. THERE IS BOERNER HORVATH MISTER KALRA IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTRESS THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- TO THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY. SOME FOLKS IN OPPOSITION- THAT I WOULD ARGUE ARE PLAYING MORE ON EMOTIONS AND ACTUALLY THE FACTS OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES. OF THE SUGGESTION THAT IT WOULD CLOSE USE OR WHILE THAT EXIT REPARATIONS AND MAKE IMPORTING ANIMALS IMPOSSIBLE COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. IN EXISTING LAW THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE RULES GOVERNING THE IMPORTATION OF WILD ANIMALS. CDFW ALREADY EXERCISED DISCRETION WHICH WILD ANIMALS OR AUTHORIZING THE STATE. THE ASSOCIATION OF ZOOS AND AQUARIUMS IS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR ZOO ACCREDITATION DUE TO ITS HIGH STANDARDS FOR CONSERVATION EDUCATION TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AND REGULATION ALLOW CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS ARE PERMITS FOR ACA ACCREDITED ZOOS. NON ACA ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS GOING TO SEE TO GET OF FOR AWAY. TO BE TREATED LIKE A CA OCCURRED ZOOS THAT'S ANOTHER SEVEN NOT CHANGED ANYTHING. REGARDING THIS WAIVER PROCESS FOR NON ACA. ACCREDITED ZOOS- THOSE NON ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO OBTAIN WILD ANIMAL PERMITS. FROM CITY OF DERBY EVEN THE EASY IS HE A CREDIT IS AFTER% TEN WILD ANIMAL PERMISSION CDFW FOR CERTAIN WILD ANIMALS. UNDER EXISTING REGULATIONS SO LONG AS TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS ARE MET A LOT OF THE CONVENTIONS PORTED INTO AND OUT OF THE STATE. DURING THE ONE YEAR THE PERMIT IS VALID FOR WHAT THIS BILL DOES REALLY- IS THAT THESE NON AZ'S USER ASKING TO- UNDERCUT EXISTING STATE LAW AND CDFW RESTORED. AND PROVISIONS AFTER SB SYLLABUS THIRTY FIVE WHICH CONCERNED ANIMAL IMPORTS FOCUS ON PREVENTING. THE IMPORT OF ANIMALS WHICH CARRY DISEASE THE GOAL THESE PROVISIONS ARE IN PART OF THAT THE NEXT PANDEMIC. THAT EXISTING LAW ALREADY AUTHORIZES CDFW TO BARS THESE DISEASE ANIMALS FROM THE STATE HI FOR A DISEASE LIKE OVER. SB LEVELS FIVE REVISED DIRECTION DISSIDIA. AND REQUIRES THE AUTHORIZATION TO EMPLOY ANIMALS WILD ANIMALS OCCUR THE DISEASES I'LL BE SUSPENDED ON THE WRITTEN FINDING THE CDFW. DIRECTOR BASED ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. I DON'T AMENDED AS ELEVEN FIVE BY STEPS TOWARDS THE- OF CAL. AND CAL FROM THE IMPORT OF ALL ANIMALS THAT TOO MUCH RISK UPON HEALTH IS. NAY WILDLIFE AND I DON'T IN. AND I CERTAINLY. FOR YOUR I'VE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THANK YOU. THE FAMOUS KALRA. THIS IS. NO OTHER MAY SEEKING RE ON THE IS KAMLAGER YOU MAKE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IN MY CLOTHES LIVE MARKETS UNDER CALIFORNIA ARE STRICTLY. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW ARE STRICTLY DEFINED TO MEAN THE SALE AT A RETAIL MARKET OF FROGS TURTLES AND NON POULTRY BIRDS. THIS BILL WOULD NOT IMPACT LOCAL SLAUGHTERHOUSES. IT DOES NOT AFFECT ANY AND ALL ANY ANIMAL UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT LIVE MARKET. SIMILAR TO THE PREVENTION OF SALE OF DISEASED CATTLE SWINE AND CHICKENS THESE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ANIMAL FRESHLY KILLED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. POSE NO THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH AND AS WE HAVE MOVED THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC I THINK IT SHOULD BE INCREDIBLY CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE NOT. BRINGING IN ANIMALS WHO MAY HAVE DISEASES THEY'VE BACK COULD METASTASIZE INTO ADDITIONAL STATE AND NATIONAL PANDEMICS. WE KNOW THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF WILD LIVE ANIMALS ARE IMPORTED INTO CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. AND WHILE THERE IS SOME EFFORT TO ENSURE THEY DO NOT KERRY SYNODIC DISEASES IT IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE OR COORDINATED WHICH IS WHAT SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE ATTEMPTS TO DO. I ALSO WANT TO SHARE THAT S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE ONLY APPLIES TO TRUMP IS LAWFULLY IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES AFTER JANUARY TWENTY ONE. AND ANY VIOLATION OF THESE PROVISIONS WOULD ALSO BE A FEDERAL OFFENSE INDEPENDENT OF S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY FIVE WHICH IS WHERE THE ENFORCEMENT WOULD COME IN. CDFW COULD PERIODICALLY CHECK THE FEDERAL DATABASE FOR SPECIES COVERED UNDER THIS BILL FOR ANY THAT WERE IMPORTED BY INDIVIDUALS WITH CALIFORNIA ADDRESSES. AND LASTLY I WANT TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM L. GROWS I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU. ENVIRONMENTALISTS SHOULD BE. ASKED CONCERNED ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT. AS CRIMINAL THEY SHOULD BE ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND I WOULD HOPE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL I'M ORGANIZATIONS WOULD ALSO STEP UP AND STEP IN FRONT OF ISSUES RELATED TO PUBLIC TRIAL POVERTY AND ISSUES RELATED TO YOUNG BLACK CHILDREN SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOU AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL WOULD WANT TO ENGAGE WITH YOU NEXT YEAR TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES.

ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWENTY THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE IN NEWSPAPERS. THIS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER FOR- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB THREE THREE TWENTY THREE HERE TODAY. MEMBERS MANY NEWSPAPERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE FEELING THE DEMISE OF NEWSPAPERS WILL MEAN MANY LOST JOBS AND WILL LEAVE MANY COMMUNITIES WITHOUT LOCAL JOURNALISM. IN THE BAY AREA WHEN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE AND EXAMINER WERE MERGED IN TWO THOUSAND THERE WERE OVER SIX HUNDRED PORTERS TODAY THERE IS ONLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. AS WE KNOW IT FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON A WELL INFORMED CONSTITUENCY. AS AN IMMIGRANT TO THIS COUNTRY THAT REPRESENTS EXTREMELY DIVERSE. AND EXTREMELY DIVERSE SECTION IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY I AM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ETHNIC MEDIA. AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO ASIAN AND OTHER ETHNIC AND NICHE PAPERS COULD. BE THE FIRST TO GO IN ADDITION SOME COUNTIES IN THE STATE MAY BECOME NEWS HAZARDS WITH NO PAPER OF RECORD. JUSTIN MY DISTRICT ALONE I AM AWARE OF AT LEAST FORTY SIX ETHNIC NEWSPAPER PUBLICATIONS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES IN MY COMMUNITY. IN FACT MY FATHER WHO IS NOT EIGHT. EIGHTY YEARS OLD HAS EVENTUALLY RELIED ON THE OPINION OF HIS PRIMARY SOURCE OF NEWS FOR MANY MANY YEARS HE'S NOT GOING TO TRANSITION TO GOOGLE FOR NEWS. NOW THAT ALL OF THE CONTACTS IS GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND THE NEWSPAPERS ARE FACING AN ADDITIONAL AVERAGE INCREASE OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE DOES NOT EXTEND EXEMPTIONS. FROM AB FIVE TWO NEW CARRIERS. I HAVE HEARD FROM MANY SMALL PUBLICATIONS THAT THIS COULD FORCE PAPERS TO ABANDON THEIR CONTRACT DELIVERY MODELING TWENTY TWENTY ONE. COMMUNITIES WITHOUT NEWSPAPERS THE LOSE TOUCH WITH GOVERNMENT BUSINESS EDUCATION AND NEIGHBORS. AGAIN TO USE MY PARENTS AS AN EXAMPLE COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS PLAYED A HUGE ROLE. IN KEEPING THE COMMUNITY OF THE CITY OF BELL INFORMED ON CORRUPTION ISSUES WERE. WHICH WERE PLAGUED OF PLEADING AND CITY HALL AT THAT TIME. COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS AND ETHNIC MUSIC PLAYED A HUGE ROLE IN EXPOSING THE CORRUPTION. THAT WAS TAKING PLACE ALLOWING RESIDENTS TO RESTRUCTURE THE CITY COUNCIL AND RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST. MEMBERS THIS IS WHY SB THREE TWENTY THREE IF YOU'RE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. FIRST EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE WILL EXTEND THE NEWSPAPER CARE EXEMPTION FROM DYNAMIX TEMPORARILY. UNTIL JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. A LANGUAGE HERE CONCERNING NEWSPAPER CARRIERS IS IDENTICAL TO AB ONE SEVENTY FROM LAST YEAR WHICH PROVIDED A WHEN YOU'RE EXEMPTION. WE ARE SIMPLY PUSHING THIS BACK ON TO ONE MORE YEAR. THE EEMPTION INCLUDED INCLUDED IN AB THREE TWENTY THREE CONSIDERED THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. THE PANDEMIC HAS PLACED ON THESE THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY ON TOP OF THE ALREADY DIMINISHING SALES AND REVENUE IS. EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT THE EXTENSION DOES NOT ALLOW THE NEWSPAPERS TO ESCAPE THE CURRENT LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO DELIVER DRIVERS UNDER THE BARREL STANDARD. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I AM AN IMMIGRANT TO THIS COUNTRY THE REPRESENTS AN EXTREMELY DIVERSE SECTION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I AM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ETHNIC MEDIA. BECAUSE I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING DYNAMIC MEDIA OPTIONS AVAILABLE IN A HOST OF LANGUAGES. NOBODY GOES TO THE SAME PLACE FOR SOURCES OF NEWS AND INFORMATION AND I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN KEEPING COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS AND EPIC MEDIA. VIABLE AND WIDELY AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU MAYES RUBIO MISS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I WANT TO START BY SAYING I UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM AND IMPORTANT ROLE THAT IT PLAYS IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITIES INFORMED DURING SUCH CRITICAL TIMES TONIGHT SUPPORT ETHNIC MEDIA. IT'S VITAL FOR MY DISTRICT AS WELL. BUT THIS DOESN'T JUST COVER ETHNIC MEDIA ARE SMALL PAPERS THIS COVERS EVERY SINGLE NEWSPAPER CARRIER. I CAN NEVER CONDONE OR SUPPORT AN UNSUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL THAT OPERATES AT THE EXPENSE OF LOW WAGE WORKERS. TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL MEANS FOR NEWSPAPER CARRIERS AND I WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE IS SPEAKING UP FOR THEM. THEY HAVE NO LOBBY. THEY HAVE NO UNION. THEY HAVE NOBODY. TO REPRESENT THEIR VIEWS. THESE ARE WORKERS FROM I CAN. AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET BY. IT'S ABSOLUTELY DISINGENUOUS TO SUGGEST THAT THESE WORKERS ARE ANYTHING BUT EMPLOYEES OF THE DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES THEY WORK FOR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT YOU CAN TAKE EVERY COURT CASE IT'S BEEN DECIDED SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES IT HAS BEEN DECIDED ON. BEHALF OF THESE WORKERS. THESE ARE WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS OVERWHELMINGLY LOW WAGE WORKERS HAVE TO GET UP IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING SOMETIMES AS EARLY AS MIDNIGHT TO DELIVER NEWSPAPERS. ON AVERAGE THEY MAKE THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. HE ARRIVED AT A DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPEND TWO TO THREE HOURS ASSEMBLY TO PREPARING NEWSPAPERS FOR THEIR DELIVERY ROUTES. THEY MUST PACKAGE NEWSPAPERS WITH SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS MUST DELIVER THE PAPERS WITH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS. OR BE SUBJECT TO FINES AND PENALTIES. IN ONE INSTANCE ONE WOMAN WAS A PAID ABOUT TEN CENTS PER PAPER DELIVERED. BUT SHE WAS FINED A DOLLAR IF YOU DELIVERED IT INCORRECTLY. NEWSPAPER CARRIERS HAVE TIME RESTRICTIONS AND DEADLINES TO MAKE THE DELIVERIES. FOR EXAMPLE A PAPER MUST BE DELIVERED BY FORTY FIVE AM ON WEEKDAYS AND SIX TO SIX THIRTY ON SUNDAYS. THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY FREEDOM OVER THEIR WORKING HOURS AND CONDITIONS OR THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY COMPLETE THEIR JOB. LADIES GENTLEMEN THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT THIS WORK THAT SUGGESTS THAT THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THESE ARE THE CLASSIC DEFINITION OF AN EMPLOYEE. AND I'M OKAY WITH THE FICTION THAT WE NEED TO JUST CONTINUE THIS ANOTHER YEAR. TO ALLOW NEWSPAPERS TO GO FORWARD. BUT I'M NOT OKAY WITH SAYING ARE PRETENDING. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EVEN WITHHOLD THE BRELO STANDARD. FOR ANYONE THAT READ THE DYNAMAX CASE THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF WORKER THE DYNAMICS WAS TRYING TO GET OUT. I'VE FOUGHT OVER THE YEARS TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE EXEMPTION WE PUT INTO AB FIVE FIT INTO THE CATEGORIES. IN INTO THE RATIONALE THE DYNAMICS USED. THIS IS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. IF THESE WORKERS ARE SICK THEY HAVE TO MISS A DAY THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE TO FIND A REPLACEMENT AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE. ARE THEY BREACH THEIR CONTRACT AND MUST PAY A FINE. THE PLIGHT OF THESE WORKERS IS WHY SPRING COURT UNANIMOUSLY ISSUED THE DYNAMICS DECISION IN% A BIPARTISAN WAY. IN THIS ISSUE PREDATES DYNAMAX EVEN THE MOST EGREGIOUS SITUATION THE BURRELL STANDARD HAS ACTED AS A BARRIER PREVENTING THESE WORKERS FROM ACCESSING THE BASIC EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ENTITLED TO. SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES NEWSPAPER CARRIERS HAVE HAD TO GO TO COURT IN INTER YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF LITIGATION. IN ORDER TO BE DEEMED TO MISCLASSIFIED WHICH EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY HAVE BEEN IN TO GET ANY KIND OF RELIEF. THE STANDARD THAT REQUIRES WORKERS TO BE TIED UP IN LITIGATION FOR YEARS IN ORDER TO ACCESS A BASIC MINIMUM WAGE IS A FAILURE. WE SAT HERE NEARLY A YEAR AGO IS THE INDUSTRY COMMITTED TO TAKING THE EXTRA YEAR TO FULLY COMPLY WITH A COURT REQUIREMENTS OF. EIGHTY FIVE. IT HERE WE ARE AGAIN. AND WITH NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S BEEN ANY EFFORT TO MADE TO PROPERLY CLASSIFY THESE WORKERS. IN I WOULD ARGUE THERE SIMPLY RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK. IT'S OKAY I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE IN THE SENATE AND SOME FOLKS WANT TO PASS THIS BILL I UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE OF THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY. GOD KNOWS% ALL RIGHT A LOT OF UP AS IF WE DON'T DO THIS. BUT HAVING BEEN SUBJECT TO THOSE OP ED ALL YEAR LONG. AND THEY HAVE BEEN CALLED OUT BY NAME IN THIS OFFICE ALL YEAR LONG I'LL SAY THIS. I WILL SLEEP WELL TONIGHT. BECAUSE A GROUP OF INDIVIDUAL WORKERS WHO HAS NOBODY TO SPEAK FOR THEM IT NEVER HAS IT'S NOT TO GET MY VOTE ON THIS BILL. RESPECTFULLY ASK ABOUT.

THIS REQUIRES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO CULTIVATE WITH THE TREASURER TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR A CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT TAX STRUCTURE PROGRAM FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION BY THE LEGISLATURE THIS WAS ONE OF THE PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT OUT TO TRY TO RAISE REVENUE DURING THIS TIME OF COVE IT.

COLLEAGUES WE HAVE PASSED MANY BILLS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS TO GIVE OUR CONSTITUENTS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES CROSSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS HOWEVER THIS TRAILER BILL DOES THE OPPOSITE IT GIVES GOVERNMENT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE TAXPAYERS WILL LOOKED AT US. THIS TRAILER BILL EXTENDS THE DEADLINES FOR PROPERTY TAX APPEALS BOARDS ACROSS THE STATE TO HEAR APPEALS FILED BY TAXPAYERS AND IT DOES SO RETROACTIVELY. UNTIL MARCH OF THIS YEAR. THERE IS NO REASON THESE OF BOARD CAN'T REMOTE AS HAVE BEEN DOING TO TRY AND CLEAR THIS BACKLOG. AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY ARE TAXPAYERS SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT AN EXTRA YEAR TO HAVE THEIR CLAIMS ADJUDICATED. ANOTHER TROUBLING THING THAT'S CONTAINED IN THIS TRAILER BILL IS THAT IT DIRECTS THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. TO PREPARE A PROGRAM WHERE TAX VOUCHERS ARE SOLD WITH PRESENTATION AHLERS THAT ARE CONFUSED ED SATISFACTION OR FUTURE TAX DEBTS. THIS IS YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO USE BORROWING. TO FINANCE OR DEFICIT THIS YEAR AND WILL ONLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE BUDET DEFICITS IN THE FUTURE I ORIGINAL VOTE.

THAT MEANS THAT IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE ALREADY DO NOT PAY THESE FEES ANNA DISALLOWING THE COLLECTION OF THESE FEES WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING IS PREVENTING COUNTY FORTS FROM COLLECTING THESE FEES FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN PAY THEM THAT IS NOT ONLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE INTENT OF THE BILL BUT ALSO UNFAIR TO THE COURTS ACROSS THE STATE WHO DEPEND ON THESE FEES TO PERFORM THEIR SERVICES I URGE A NO VOTE.

MISTER KING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO. PROVIDES THAT ONLY THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENTS TO THE CANNABIS CONTROL APPEALS PANEL THE TO RESIDE IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES AT THE TIME OF THEIR APPOINTMENTS. IT ALSO PROHIBITS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION FROM INCREASING THE EXCISE TAX MARKETING CULTIVATION TAX INFLATION ADJUSTMENT ON CANNABIS FOR ONE YEAR PROVIDING MUCH READ NEEDED RELIEF FOR MANY OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY WHO CAN'T ACCESS. MANY OF THE FEDERAL TAX RELIEF OR LOAN PROGRAMS THAT EVERYONE OTHER EVERYONE ELSE CAN. THEY ALSO PROHIBITS THE BORDER STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS FOR MAKING GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE BOTH. SAID THAT A BAND BOTH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION OR HAVE BEEN IN THE RETAIL SALES OF CANNABIS OR CANNABIS PRODUCTS. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR CHANG MR OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THAT A SPEAKER RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THIS BILL WILL STABILIZE CANNABIS TAX RATES IN CALIFORNIA.

AYE ARJUN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR OBERNOLTE MR LACKEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES AS WELL JUST STATED THIS BILL FREEZES THE ONE YEAR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENTOF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION REPORTED TO INCREASE THE MARKET RATE. FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE STATE'S CANNABIS EXCISE TAX INCREASE THE CULTIVATION TAX FOR INFLATION. TO BE CLEAR THIS PROPOSAL EITHER INCREASES OR DECREASES TAXES BUT WILL FREEZE THE EXISTING RATES UPON WHICH THE STATE TAXES ON CANNABIS ARE CALCULATED. IT'S SUPPORT TO NOTE THAT THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY DID NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY FEDERAL RELIEF PROGRAMS. UNDER STILL UNABLE TO TAKE STANDARD BUSINESS DEDUCTIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BEIJING ALREADY BURDENSOME STATE AND LOCAL TAXES UPWARD OF 50% AND MORE UNPREDICTABLE MARKET THE NEVER AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CERTAINTY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE STABILITY AT A TIME WHEN THE INDUSTRY NEEDS OF MOST TO FIGHT AGAINST THE BLACK MARKET THANK YOU.

OUR MEMBERS THOSE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. IN FROM THE WHERE WELL CLOSE THE ROLE AND TALLY THE VOTE I FIFTY SEVEN NO ZERO SENATE AMENDMENTS ARE CONCURRED IN. WE WILL NOW TAKE UP OF WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE CLERK WILL READ. ILLEGAL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX BY THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AN ACCOLADE AND TAXATION AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION OF FOUR TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BE RELATED TO THE BUDGET. MISTER KING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX EXPANDS THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. TAKE ANY OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL WITH THE FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS AN ITEM. THIS BUILDS UPON EARLIER ACTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN TO EXTEND THE CALLIE ITC TO THESE TAXPAYERS IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE WITH A YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THIS WILL ALLOW ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE TAX FILERS TO RECEIVE THE CALL THE A TO SEE BENEFIT. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE ARE WORKING INDIVIDUALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHO IF THEY WERE UNEMPLOYED OR HAVE BEEN LAID OFF CANNOT ACCESS OR FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. SO WE THOUGHT DURING THIS VERY TODD CHALLENGING TIME OF A COVERT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE WORKING. AND REALLY ADDING TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY HAS EVERY RIGHT AND THE ABILITY TO ACCESS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE THE CAL THE ITC. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL ON A. B. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU MR CHANG MR OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX. THIS TRAILER BILL EXTENDS THE EARNED INCOME TAX PROGRAM TO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO LACK A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER BUT INSTEAD HAVE. AN INDIVIDUAL. TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. UNLIKE OTHER ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS THE EITC IS A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT THAT MEANS TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TAX LIABILITY YOU GET A CHECK BACK FROM THE GOVERNMENT. WHICH CREATES A POWERFUL INCENTIVE FOR FRAUD AND ABUSE. RIGHT NOW THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD GUARDS AGAINST THAT FRAUD AND ABUSE BY COMPARING RECORDS FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE USING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS TO MATCH UP FILERS WITH EARNINGS. UNFORTUNATELY THE IRS DOES NOT ACCEPT ITUNES ONLY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OF THIS SAFEGUARD WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE. FURTHERMORE I TENS PERIODICALLY EXPIRE SO EVEN USING STATEWIDE DATABASES TO TRY AND MATCH UP EARNINGS AGAINST FILERS WILL BE PROBLEMATIC. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ITSELF HAS RAISED SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PRACTICE SAYING THE FRAUD AND ABUSE OR WILL FRAUD AND ABUSE WILL BE LIKELY TO INCREASE SHOULD WE TAKE THIS STEP I ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU MR. OBERNOLTE DR EMILY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. B. EIGHT THIRTY ONE ALSO AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I'M PROUD THAT WE CONTINUE TO ANSWER THE CALL. FOR EQUITY AND TO MOVE PURPOSELY AWAY FROM POLICIES THAT INADVERTENTLY OR INTENTIONALLY CAUSE HARM. THE FULL INCLUSION OF ITEMS INTO CAL EITC WILL HELP US TO BALANCE THE SCALES OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR FAMILIES. WHO UP TO THIS POINT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF RECEIVING TAX CREDITS FOR THEIR LABORS. THIS WILL PUT MONEY BACK IN THE POCKETS OF ALL WORKING FAMILIES ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN THEY NEED IT THE MOST. THIS WILL BE A WELCOME RELIEF AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS PETUNIA OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISS GONZALES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I'M NOT A SPEAKER I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS THIS HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR US FOR YEARS NOW AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO BOTH THE- CHAIRED THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND OUR SPEAKER TO REALLY LOOKING OUT FOR TAX PAYING CALIFORNIANS THAT'S WHAT THIS SAYS THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO PAY THEIR TAXES EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND ARE DENIED THE RELIEF AND TAX CREDITS AT OTHER WORKING CALIFORNIANS GET. IT HAS BEEN A LONG ROAD IT IS UNFAIR WHAT WE HAVE DONE TO SO MANY PEOPLE WHO RIGHT NOW ARE DEEMED ESSENTIAL WORKERS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE WORKING ON OUR FARMS IN AND I AM HELPING CLEAN UP AFTER US AND IT'S TIME WE ENSURE THAT TAXPAYERS ALL HAVE THE SAME RELIEF AND THESE I TEND I'M FILERS HAVE THAT RELIEF AS WELL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE.

THE BILL ALSO APPROPRIATES TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY POINT SIX MILLION IN BOND FUNDS TO ACCELERATE THAT SPENDING SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET TO WORK IMMEDIATELY. IN A PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CLEAN WATER A HUNDRED THREE POINT THREE MILLION FOR INFILL HOUSING. AND FIFTY ONE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONS TO ALLOW THE FUNDING OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR THE IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES PROVIDERS WITHIN EXISTING FUNDS. IF AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION IS ENACTED- WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL FOR SB ONE ONE FIVE THANK YOU MR CHANG MR OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THAT A SPEAKER RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FIFTEEN.

OF GETTING SICK AND DYING FROM COVERT NINETEEN. TO ACHIEVE HEALTH EQUITY. BARRIERS MUST BE REMOVED SO THAT EVERYONE HAS A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO BE AS HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS WHY I AM PLEASED TO SEE SB ONE FIFTEEN ALLOCATES FUNDS. TO INVEST IN COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS AND HELP PROTECT OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR STATE. DEVELOPING COMMUNITY BASED OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT HELP OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED BY COLLUDED. RECOVER FROM COVE IT IS SIMPLY THE RIGHT THING FOR US TO DO.

MOVING TO WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE SB EIGHT TWENTY THE CLERK WILL READ. SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AN ACT RELATING TO EDUCATION FINANCE AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET THIRTEEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISS MADAM SPEAKER S. B. A. TWENTY IS OUR EDUCATION CLEAN U TRAILER JUST TO GIVE YOU COUPLE HIGHLIGHTS YOU RECALL THAT. MANY OF THE SCHOOLS THAT HAD A GROWING- CLASSROOM POPULATION HAD CHALLENGES REGARDING OUR CURRENT BUDGET WHICH HELD. WHICH HELD LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HARBORS SO WE'RE TAKING AND MAKING SOME CHANGES TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE SCHOOLS WITH GROWING POPULATIONS ARE GETTING THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THEY NEED WE ALSO AMENDED AND MADE AMENDMENTS TO THE CLUE. OF FUNDING AND TIMELINE FLEXIBILITY TO THESE. DISTRICTS TO MAKE SURE THAT DURING THIS CALL THE PANDEMIC THAT THEY CAN. HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED TO OPEN BACK UP. IT ALSO CLARIFIES VARIOUS. BUDGET ACT CHILD CARE POLICIES APPROPRIATIONS TO INCLUDE THE MEASURE THE PROVIDERS ARE HELD HARMLESS BUT THEY WERE ALSO OUR FAMILY FEE WAIVERS IN PARIS SIGNATURE POLICIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS CLARIFIED. WE ALSO- INCREASE THE BUDGET APPROPRIATION FOR COVERT CLOSURE IN SUMMER MEALS% PROGRAM. I HAVE FROM ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION CARES ACT FNDING TO A TOTAL OF A- HUNDRED NINETEEN NINETY TWO MILLION IN KERR'S RE FUNDING. RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL MEALS DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE ON S. B. EIGHT TWENTY. THANK YOU MR KING MR OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AS BIGGER RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT TWENTY. I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER WOULD AGREE THAT IT MAKES SENSE. TO HOLD OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HARMLESS. WHEN IT COMES. WHAT IT COMES TO DECLINES IN ENROLLMENT RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS PRICES. HOWEVER THIS BILL GOES BEYOND THAT AND UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST CHARTER SCHOOLS WHO COULD NOT HAVE FORESEEN THE IMPORT THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT THEY'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING AS ROADS ALL TO CORONAVIRUS. IN ADDITION THIS TRAILER BILL SAYS THAT NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS ARE COMPLETELY INELIGIBLE FOR ANY ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING WHICH IS COMPLETELY NONSENSICAL SENSIBLE BECAUSE THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THE BEST POSITIONED. TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS ENVIRONMENT WHEN OUR SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED DOWN. COLLEAGUES THIS BILL VIOLATES THE BASIC PREMISE IN CALIFORNIA THAT FUNDING SHOULD FOLLOW THE STUDENT I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MR OBERNOLTE MR KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER THIS BILL DOES MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PRIOR EDUCATION FINANCE BILL BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR POINTED OUT. IT DOUBLES DOWN ON THE OVERT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS I MADE MY- FEELINGS ABOUT THAT VERY CLEAR BEFORE SO I'LL JUST GIVE YOU THE SHORT. VERSION RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THAT THIS THIS. IS A- INDECENT AND ALTOGETHER IMPROPER PLEASE VOTE NOW. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT OUR BUDGET CHAIR FROM SAN FRANCISCO TALKED ABOUT THIS IS A CLEAN UP TO THE- JUNE BUDGET ACCORD THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HERE. AND OUR COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON WHO IS NOT HERE TODAY. WITH THE ILL FAMILY MEMBER TALKED ABOUT IN HER DISTRICT THERE IS A DISTRICT AND HOW A LOT OF BAY AREA GROWTH. THEY WERE PLANNING LITERALLY TO DOUBLE THEIR SIZE OF THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT THE NEXT. CALENDAR YEAR. AND THEY WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS HARM BY NOT GETTING ADEQUATE FUNDING. SO WE DECIDED THAT WAS A FLAW WE WANTED TO FIX. UP IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ENTIRE ISSUES THAT'S BEING BROUGHT UP. IT WOULD BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THERE'S NO MAGIC TO FERRY HANDING AROUND MONEY HERE THAT MONEY WE HAVE TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. SO I ASKED THE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THIS. YOU WANT TO TAKE THOSE DOLLARS IN YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT OVER HERE BECAUSE WHAT WE DID. LAST SPRING WE ASK NOT THE TEACHERS WE ASK THE WHOLE EDUCATION COMMUNITY. SCHOOL DISTRICT SCHOOL BOARDS ACCESS THE BUSINESS OFFICERS WHAT'S THE BEST THING WE COULD DO TO HOLD SCHOOLS HARMLESS THEY SAID DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND. AS FAR AS PICK A DATE AND WILL PICK THAT TIME TO FIND SCHOOLS AT THAT LEVEL. THAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COVER NINETEEN CRISIS WHICH WE HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS AT OUR STATE BUDGET WE CAN'T PRINT MONEY I GUESS WE COULD TAKE MONEY FROM THE RESERVE THE RAINY DAY FUND BUT WE NEED TO. AS THAT'S BECAUSE THE VICE CHAIR SAID WE NEED THAT MONEY FOR NEXT YEAR'S DEFICIT SO THIS WAS. A RESPONSIBLE DECISION IT'S NOT DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST CHARTER SCHOOLS THERE ARE MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A HOLD HARMLESS FOR THE- CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS JUST SAYS THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON. THE PLANNED GROWTH NOT THE REALITY OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH-CO THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE OUT OF COPING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE'LL GET BACK TO FUNDING BUT THIS WAS A WAY TO MAKE SURE OUR SCHOOLS STAY AFLOAT. WE DON'T HAVE OUR SCHOOL WE DON'T HAVE MORE OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT'S GOING THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS ASK YOUR AB THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY A MISTER VARYING YOUR- THANK YOU MADAM. COLLEAGUES I DON'T LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS- TRAILER BILL. AMENDS THE SCHOLARSHIP- KIDS INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT SAVINGS PROGRAM- TO IN.

AT THE FIRST CAUCUS LUNCH THAT WE HAD. THIRTY SIX HOURS AFTER POLLS CLOSE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. I'M SITTING THERE. I HARDLY SLEPT IN SEVENTY TWO HOURS. TRYING TO PLAY IT COOL I BARELY KNOW ANYONE IN THE ROOM PRETTY MUCH IN ALL OF THE WHOLE SITUATION. AND UP POPS TODD. LOOKING LIKE A MODEL. ANY GIVES A MEMORIZED FIFTEEN MINUTE TRIBUTE TO THE SPEAKER. COOL CALM COLLECTED I WAS STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PRONOUNCE THE SPEAKERS LAST NAME. WAS IT RENDON RENDELL OWN. BUT WHEN TODD SAT DOWN THIRTY MINUTES AFTER HE BEGAN. I KNEW HE'D BE A LEADER IN OUR CLASS. A FEW DAYS LATER TODD AND I WERE SITTING IN THE LOBBY OF THE CITIZENS HOTEL OF THE CITIZEN HOTEL. WAITING FOR OUR BAGS TO COME OUT. I LOOK OVER AT TODD ANY WITHOUT A CELL PHONE PLUGGED INTO HIS LAPTOP SET UP A SATELLITE PHONE ON HIS RIGHT AND AN ESPRESSO MACHINE ON HIS LEFT. ALL I HAD WAS MY CELL PHONE AND 5% BATTERY. IN THAT MOMENT I TOLD MYSELF MARC JUST DO WHATEVER TODD DOES THIS GUY'S A PRO. BUT IT'S TIME I QUICKLY BECAME CLOSE FRIENDS I REALIZED SOMETHING THAT ABSOLUTELY BLEW MY MIND. TODD GLORIA IS A BETTER PERSON ON THE INSIDE MANY IS ON THE OUTSIDE. AND IT LOOKS GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE. TODD IS SINCERE SMART AND SELFLESS. HE IS KIND CARING AND COMPASSIONATE. HE'S ALWAYS PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE FLOOR AND YOUR BILL IS STRUGGLING TO GET TO FORTY ONE VOTES HILL IMMEDIATELY SHOW UP AT YOUR SIDE ASKING WHOSE VOTES HE CAN HELP YOU GO GET. EVEN IF HE'S PERSONALLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I SPENT THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF THE YEAR STAYING AT THE SHARED. ONE DAY I COMPLAINED TO TALK ABOUT HOW SOME OF THE BATHROOM DOORS IN THE HOTEL OR ON SPRINGS. IN THE DOORS DON'T STAY OPEN. A FEW DAYS LATER I WALKED INTO MY OFFICE. IN ON MY DESK WITH A RUBBER DOOR STOP. IN A NOTE FROM TIME. SPEAKING OF THE SHARED AND- IT WAS THERE THAT I ALSO LEARNED. THAT TODD LITERALLY WAKES UP IN A SUIT AND TIE. HAIR GELLED A PETUNIA IN HIS LAPEL. LOOKING LIKE A MILLION BUCKS. I WOULD STUMBLE UP TO THE BREAKFAST LOUNGE IN THE MORNING. JEANS AND A SWEATSHIRT HAT TALK BELOW AND WHEN THE ELEVATOR DOORS WOULD SWING OPEN ON THE TWENTY SIXTH FLOOR THE FIRST THING I'D SEE IS TODD SMILING FACE. SUITED UP MAN BAG IN HAND DONE WITH BREAKFAST AND READY TO GO TO THE CAPITOL THE WORK FOR HIS CONSTITUENTS. AND YOU MIGHT THINK THAT ANYONE WHO LOOKS THAT GOOD MUST LOVE THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE. YOU WOULD BE SO VERY VERY WRONG. LAST YEAR DURING A TRIP DOWN TO SAN DIEGO FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION CONFERENCE TODD PICK ME UP AT THE HOTEL TO GO TO DINNER. I SAID LET'S GO GET CHINESE FOOD SOMETHING MY WIFE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE SO WE DON'T NEED A VERY OFTEN. I FIGURED TODD HE OF EIGHT YEARS ON THE SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL. INTERIM MAYOR. AND THAT POINT THREE REPRESENTING THE CITY- IN THE COMMUNITY IN THE ASSEMBLY. HE KNOW OF A GREAT PLACE TO GO. HE SAID HE HAD A PLACE IN MIND. IN FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER WE WERE SITTING DOWN AT A SMALL AUTHENTIC CHINESE RESTAURANT. YEP JAMES. EVERY SINGLE TIME IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT I'VE SEEN TODD SMILING FACE OR THIS YEAR HIS SMILING FACE I HAVEN'T MEDIALLY FELT BETTER NO MATTER WHAT OTHER MEN IS GOING ON AROUND US. TODD I AM SO SAD I WON'T SEE YOU EVERY DAY UP HERE BUT I CAN'T WAIT TO VISIT YOU- IN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IN SAN DIEGO ALL MISSING. THANK YOU MR BERMAN NOW BECAUSE WE ARE CELEBRATING THE WITH HIMSELF. WE HAVE TO MOVE PAST THE NEXT BIGGER BECAUSE SHE'S NOT HERE YEAH. TWO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW. INTERMENT THERE ARE ZERO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. WHERE IS THAT TODD AT. OF IRAQ I HAD A- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW- TODD IS ONE SASSY INDIVIDUAL. SASSY IS TO SAY THE LEAST AND IF ANY OF YOU HAD TO HAVE A CHANCE TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL AT OUR EIGHT O'CLOCK LGBT CAUCUS BREAKFAST YOU WILL SEE THAT 95% OF THE TIME IT'S JUST GOSSIPING. AND THROUGH SOME BUSINESS BUT- WE WILL MISS TODD BECAUSE IT WAS TIED THAT GETS US SO ENERGIZED IN THE MORNING- WITH THIS CONTINUING JOKES THAT HE'S HAD. OF BUT HE HAS A VERY SERIOUS SIDE HIM AS WELL. AND I SAW THAT WHEN WE WERE MUCH YOUNGER MAYBE ALMOST ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I THINK NOW. IN WHICH- IT WAS MYSELF A YOUNG ELECTED OFFICIAL NAME ROBERT GARCIA. AND A YOUNG MARE NAMED CHRISTOPHER BALDING. AND THERE WAS THE FOUR OF US CELEBRATING IN LONG BEACH PRICE IN WHICH WE ALL CRAMMED IN A SMALL HOTEL ROOM BECAUSE WE CAN AFFORD. TO BE IN SEPARATE ROOMS. SO THERE WE WERE. TODD GLORIA NICE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR. TO SAVE MONEY AND IT WAS DURING THAT TIME WE START CHARTING OUT OF POLITICAL TASK. THING WHERE WE SHOULD WE ALL GO. AND TARGET CONTINUALLY SAID MY HEART IS IN THE CITY I WAS BORN IN. WHICH IS THAT IN SAN DIEGO. BORN AND RAISED FORTY TWO YEARS OF HIS PRECIOUS LIFE. IN SAN DIEGO AND IT'S NO WONDER THAT YOU SERVED AS INTERIM MAYOR AT AN IMPORTANT TIME BUT WE KNOW THAT. YOU HAVE SUCH A DEEP CHARACTER TO YOURSELF. A SIMILARLY THERE IS A GROUPS THAT GOES OUT TO DO EXERCISE CLASS AT SIX AM IN THE MORNING. HERE AND SURE ENOUGH IN BETWEEN DIFFERENT SETS FOR ALL SETTING UP TODD TO ANSWERING EMAILS AND TWEETING. I SAID CAN YOU JUST FOCUS FOCUS ON WHAT WE'RE DOING. HE SAID I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THIS CONSTITUENTS. WE THEN WE'RE DRIVING THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I WAS DRIVING AND SURE ENOUGH INSTEAD OF LISTENING ON THE PHONE OR JUST CASUALLY TALKING TO ME. YET AS WELL NO CARDS PERSONALLY WRITING THANK YOU NOTES TO EVERYONE. THE CONSUMMATE PUBLIC SERVANT AND SO TODD I HAVE LEARNED FROM YOU- I KNOW WE WILL FIND YOU IN. THE PLACES I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONTINUE SERVICE WE LOOK FOR TO MUCH MORE HEADED FOR YOU. THANK YOU MR LOW. MISLI MON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AS RUBIO STAFF THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I HAVE THE HONOR THAT IS DEFINITELY A BITTER SWEET. ONE TO SAY THE LEAST- TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT ONE OF MY LEGISLATIVE PESKY'S ASSEMBLY MEMBER TODD GLORIA. I FIRST MET TODD IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND IT WAS TRULY LEGISLATIVE TESTY AT FIRST SIGHT. WE MET AT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES INFORMATIONAL TRAINING HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND I REMEMBER SITTING IN A LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM. SURROUNDING SURROUNDED BY INSPIRING LEGISLATORS AND ONE OF THEM ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS. AND ME NOT KNOWING ANYONE IN THE ROOM LOOKED UP TO SEE IF N. NAME ANYWAYS THINKING WHAT I WAS THINKING AS I HEARD THIS ONE MEMBER ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS. AND OF COURSE THE FIRST IS THAT LOCKS WERE TODD GLORIA. AND TAUGHT AND I IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED AND WE GAVE EACH OTHER A LOOK AS WE HEARD FROM OUR NOW COLLEAGUE LAURA FRIEDMAN. THE PRESENT. AND YES TIME AND I HAVE BEEN CONNECTED EVER SINCE THAT MOMENT. THANK YOU LARA. HI I HAVE GOT A CHANCE TO WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH TODD AND GET TO KNOW HIM AS THE LEADER THE LEGISLATOR AND THE HUMAN THAT HE IS. AND I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM TODD. I'VE LEARNED BOTH ABOUT WHO HE IS BUT ALSO LEARN HOW TO BE BETTER EVERYTHING I DO. TODD IS A PERSON. THAT KNOWS A LOT ABOUT HOW TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT ADVANCING EQUITY. LIKE THE ONE TIME THAT OUR FRESHMAN YEAR WHEN I WALKED INTO A MEETING I SAT DOWN AND WAS IMMEDIATELY GREETED WITH CITY HERE WITH THE BIG BOYS MONIQUE. I LOOKED AT ME. AND THE BOYS AND SAID RIGHT ALL BIG KIDS AT THIS TABLE. TODD IS ALSO SOMEONE WHO I'VE LEARNED FROM WHEN IT COMES TO BEING A LEGISLATIVE CHAMPION. AND HAVING TO TRY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. LIKE WITH HIS BILL AB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN AT THIRTEEN THREE YEARS TO GET OUT AND IT WAS A FIGHT. TO MAKE SURE THAT HE BROUGHT WITH HIM FROM SAN DIEGO. THAT THE TRANSFERS H. THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES COULD BE SELF DETERMINING. IN ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN FUNDING. A LITTLE POLICY WONK BUT NONE THE LESS IT SHOWS WHAT A TRUE CHAMPION IS FOR A LOCAL COMMUNITY. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT TODD IS VERY PUNCTUAL. WE'VE GOT IN HIS TEXT MESSAGES OR CALLS. AND WE KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO BE ON TIME BUT FOR MOST OF US WE STILL STRUGGLE TO BE LIKE TAUGHT IN THAT AREA. TODD IS A MAN OF HUMILITY TRULY HE IS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE WHEN YOU HANG OUT WITH TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW THAT HE'S A SIMPLE GUY. AND PREFERS MCDONALD'S AND JACK IN THE BOX AMONG HIS FAVORITES PICKS TO EAT. THAT MAKES HIM HAPPY AND IT BRINGS A SMILE TO HIS FACE. SPEAKING OF SMILES TODD IS THE LEADER WHO CAN MAKE ANYONE SMILE OR LAUGH. AND FOR THAT. WE SOMETIMES REFER TO OUR TEXT THREADS. PERHAPS SOME OF US HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE THE ABILITY AND SKILL TO HELP PEOPLE SMILE AND LAUGH BUT A LOT OF US ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE WORLD WE'RE IN IN CALIFORNIA WHERE IT SEEMS WE'RE CONSTANTLY ADDRESSING PROBLEM AFTER PROBLEM AND THEY DON'T AND- WE'RE LUCKY IF WE ARE ON A TEXT THREAD WITH TODD. AND YOU KNOW AT THE MOMENT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MOST INAPPROPRIATE TIME AND LAUGH OUT LOUD YOU KNOW IT'S BECAUSE TODD HAD SOMETHING SARCASTIC WITTY OR HILARIOUS TO SAY. TADI IS ALSO SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE. I WATCHED HIM THROUGH TIME AND HE WAS THE FIRST IN OUR FRESHMAN CLASS TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING.

MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO TURN TO FILE ITEM EIGHTY ONE. SB FIFTY FOUR MS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. ADAM SPEAKER. I RISE TO PRESENT. LAWLER GONZALEZ. SORRY-I DIDN'T HAVE THE CLERK READ YOUR ONE SECOND. SENATE BILL FIFTY FOUR VICE CENTER ALLEN AND OTHERS AND ACT WITHIN THE SOLID WASTE. WE WERE SO EXCITED WE JUMPED THE GUN. I RECOGNIZE THIS IS ALICE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE TO PRESENT SB FIFTY FOUR THE COMPANION MEASURE TO MY OWN BILL AB TEN EIGHTY WHICH PASSED THE SENATE YESTERDAY WITH TWENTY THREE VOTES. WOULD INSURE CALIFORNIA IS ON THE FOREFRONT OF REDUCING POLLUTION FROM SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS. ALL OF US ALREADY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH PLASTIC. WE SEE THE COUNTLESS NEWS STORIES ON MARINE LIFE DYING WITH STOMACHS FULL OF PLASTIC WE SEE THE LITTER IN OUR STREETS OUR LOCAL LANDFILLS REACHING CAPACITY. IN OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES SPENDING FAR TOO MUCH ON THE BUDGETS ON WASTE MANAGEMENT. THAT'S WHY THEY SUPPORT THIS BILL. THE CURRENT PANDEMIC HAS ONLY INCREASED AWARENESS OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC LIKE UTENSILS BAGS AND CONTAINERS. OF ALL OF OUR FAVORITE TAKEOUTS. NO ONE IS SAYING THAT THESE ITEMS DON'T HAVE TO USE BUT WE ARE NOT BEING HONEST WITH OURSELVES ABOUT THEIR END OF LIFE AND IT'S PAST TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE REFORM WE WILL CONTINUE TO THROW OUR SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND THE RECYCLING BIN. TO BE SORTED AND BALED. BUT THEY WILL ONLY END UP IN THE LANDFILL OR INCINERATED. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL WOULD TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO REDUCE WASTE. FROM SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING. AND SPECIFIED PRODUCTS 75% BY TWENTY THIRTY TO THROUGH SOURCE REDUCTION RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING. AND REQUIRE THESE ITEMS BE FULLY RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE. BY TWENTY THIRTY TO. HOW WE GET THERE WILL. BY ROAD TAKE PROCESS IN CONSULTATION WITH AN INDEPENDENT PANEL. AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL REQUIRED RECYCLING RATES. BY HOLDING PRODUCERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACHIEVING THESE GOALS WE WILL CREATE THE DEMAND FOR OUR RECYCLABLES TO BE TURNED INTO NEW PRODUCTS. LANGUAGE IN THE BILL TO ENCOURAGE IN STATE MAUFACTURING AND DISCOURAGE THE EXPORT OF MATERIALS HELPS DRIVE US TOWARDS A PATH WHERE CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD NOT JUST IN THE REDUCTION OF WASTE. BUT IN GROWING OUR IN STATE RECYCLING INDUSTRY THIS MEANS JOBS. JOBS JOBS. BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANION BILLS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE HAD OVER TEN HEARINGS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. INSPECT COUNTLESS HOURS WITH MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL SIDES WITH DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED VIEWS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND CAL RECYCLE. WE ALSO TOOK A HARD THIS YEAR WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT AND HOW TO CUT THE SCOPE OF THE BILL DOWN FROM LAST YEAR REDUCE COSTS AND GIVE BUSINESSES RELIEF. LANGUAGE WORKED ON ALL YEAR IN IN THIS FORM REDUCES THE BILL FROM COVERING ALL MATERIAL TYPES TO PLASTIC ONLY. IN MORE CLEARLY EXEMPTS NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNTS OF PLASTIC AND PACKAGING SUCH AS CAPS OR LABELS. IT GIVES TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS TO PRODUCERS TO MEET THE SPECIFIED RECYCLING RATES IN THE BILL MEANING THAT A PRODUCER WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO AN ACTUAL PENALTY FOR FAILING TO MEET THE RECYCLING RATE UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY. TEN YEARS FROM NOW. BUT PLEASE DON'T BE LULLED INTO THINKING BECAUSE IT'S TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE CAN PUT THIS OFF WE KEEP PUTTING IT OFF EVERY YEAR. IT PROVIDES RELIEF TO SMALLER BUSINESSES BY CLARIFYING EXEMPTION AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERING THE MAXIMUM PENALTY AMOUNT FOR SMALLER SIZED PRODUCERS FROM FIFTY THOUSAND TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. PER VIOLATION. AT IT ADDS CONSIDERATION OF AGRICULTURAL CONCERNS INCLUDING AN EXEMPTION FOR FARMERS A PACKAGE ON SITE AND ADDITION OF A RE REPRESENTATIVE ON THE ADVISORY PANEL AND VARIOUS PROVISIONS ON FEDERAL REGULATIONS FOR FOOD PACKAGING. IT CLARIFIES DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND CODE RATHER THAN LEAVING IT UP TO THE DEPARTMENT ADD SIGNIFICANT SAFEGUARDS TO STEER TO STORE CHIP ORGANIZATIONS INTO USING OUR EXISTING COLLECTION AND SORTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT FEASIBLE INCORPORATES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION ON THE LOGISTICS OF THE MINISTRY FEET IN THE BILL. AT THE END OF THE DAY NOT EVERY COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION IS GOING TO BE SATISFIED THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE BECAUSE SOME SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO AND ARE GOING TO USE A PANDEMIC AS AN EXCUSE TO KEEP WAITING ON A SOLUTION THAT IS NOT COMING IN. THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAYS THEY'RE PUTTING OUT INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR COMMUNITIES SB FIFTY FOUR DEMANDS AND THAT PRODUCERS FINALLY BECOME PART OF THE WAY SOLUTION. THAT CONSUMERS HAULERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN HAVE BEEN TRYING THEIR BEST TO COMBAT. BUT CANNOT KEEP UP WITH WITHOUT THE MISSING LINK I WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT WE CAN ACT OR WE CAN WAIT FOR A PROPOSITION TO BE PUT ON THE BALLOT IN PASSED BECAUSE IT WILL PASS WE CAN HAVE A HAND IN WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE OR WE CAN ALLOW OTHER PEOPLE TO DO IT. FOR US I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ MISSED FRIEDMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS MEMBERS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE GET A HANDLE ON PLASTIC POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN FACT IN THE WORLD WE'VE ALL SEEN THE HEARTBREAKING PHOTOS OF DEAD SEA ANIMALS WE ALL HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO OUR CHILDREN. WHY THIS COULD BE MORE PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN BY THE TIME THEY GROW UP AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE FISH IN THE OCEAN. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT IS ETERNAL THAT DOESN'T BIODEGRADE. THAT IS LITERALLY KILLING PARTS OF OUR PLANET. AND I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL AS SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED ON THIS BILL IN MY COMMITTEE FOR THE PAST YEAR. THIS BILL IS ALSO AN EXAMPLE OF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COMPROMISE. OF AN AUTHOR WHO HAS SPENT. HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS SPEAKING TO THE BROAD OF OUR GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE. I HAVE SPENT HOURS TALKING TO THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE. AND I CAN TELL YOU A FEW THINGS. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE BY MAKING EVERYBODY COMPLETELY HAPPY IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN. LET ME TELL YOU WHERE WE WERE A YEAR AGO WITH THIS BILL. WE HAD A LOT OF MEMBERS WHO SUPPORTED INDUSTRY. AND WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR IT. WE ALSO HAD A LOT OF MEMBERS WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND FROM AND- AKAN. WHO DIDN'T TO VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WENT FAR ENOUGH. I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO BROAD. THEY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE. SO YOU REALLY HAD A BILL THAT HAD A LONG WAY TO GO. WHERE ARE WE TODAY. WE ARE NOW WITH THE BILL THAT'S BEEN WORKED ON BY PROFESSIONALS IN THIS AREA BY EXPERTS IN THIS ARENA. WITH AN EYE TOWARDS BEING PRACTICAL. BEING WORKABLE BEING FAIR. BUT HAVING OFF RAMPS. AND SPEED BUMPS FOR INDUSTRY TO GIVE THEM TIME TO COMPLY. A BILL THAT IS ENFORCEABLE THAT'S NERO TO ONLY PLASTICS IN ONLY THE TIME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PLASTICS. A BILL THAT ACTUALLY HAS A CHANCE. TO WORK AND DO SOMETHING AND TO SET A STANDARD FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO FOLLOW. WELL THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. IF WE KEEP SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACT IF WE KEEP SAYING. THAT WE'RE GOING TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IS PERFECT YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO WHERE EVERY GROUP THINKS IS PERFECT IN THIS BUT WHAT YOU CAN GET TO IS SOMETHING WHERE WE FINALLY. TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. IN THIS STATE OF. THE STATE FOR THIS PRODUCT. I COME FROM MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT AS A LOT OF YOU DO FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND WHAT'S AND EVERYONE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT COST ON THIS COST INDUSTRY COST EVERYONE YOU KNOW WAS PAYING THE FULL COST. OF PLASTIC POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA. TAXPAYERS THAT TO. ANY OF YOU OF THE MUNICIPALITY- LOCALITY THAT HAS ITS OWN LANDFILL IS MY CITY DOES. KNOWS THAT IF THE PEOPLE IN THAT COMMUNITY WHO PAY EVERY SINGLE TIME. FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THIS PRODUCT FOR POLLUTION CLEAN IF ANY OF YOU WERE ON THE COAST LINE KNOW THAT YOU ARE PAYING FOR THE POLLUTION. THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS TO TOURISM THAT YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS OF YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHY THIS PLASTIC POLLUTION ALL OVER THE BEACH. THE INDUSTRIES TO SHIP THIS INTO OUR AREA. THEY PAY NONE OF THAT. THEY DON'T PAY A DIME THEY'RE OFF THE HOOK. THEY SAY THAT THERE'S COSTS INVOLVED TO THEIR CONSUMERS YOU KNOW WHAT RIGHT NOW THERE'S COST TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN REAL DOLLARS THEY ARE PAYING FOR THAT. INDUSTRY HAVE TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE IS THE BARE MINIMUM USE RECYCLED CONTENT. USE IT. YES MAYBE RIGHT NOW THIS PENNIES MORE TO USE IT BUT THAT'S MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE SAVED BY YOUR TAXPAYERS WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THE COLLECTION OF THAT MATERIAL IN THE DISPOSAL OF THAT MATERIAL. I'VE GOT A LOT OF REALLY WANT KEY POINTS I CAN GIVE YOU ABOUT HOW THIS CREATES JOBS WHICH WE ALL KNOW- ABOUT A SEVENTY FIVE ACHIEVING A 75% RECYCLING. TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. HOW THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO BE CREATED BY THIS AND CREATING MARKETS I COULD TALK TO YOU AGAIN ABOUT HOW THEY'VE EXEMPTED BOTTLE BILL CONTAINERS THEY'VE EXEMPTED EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR PLASTIC THE TALK I TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW THEY'VE EXEMPTED RETAILERS LIKE AT SEA THE SMALL PEOPLE THE ONLINE RETAILERS THAT ONLY FACILITATE SALES BETWEEN THIRD PARTIES. THAT THE EXAM PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE- THAT THAT ARE IN CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW AND GUIDANCE ESPECIALLY ABOUT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS THEY ALSO HAVE CAL RECYCLE LOOK AT FOOD RATE WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS PRACTICAL AND DOABLE BUT THERE IS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON AND ON AND ON INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCOMMODATED AT EVERY SINGLE TURN WITH AMENDMENTS WHAT WHAT'S IN THIS BILL. WE CAN ALL COME UP WITH REASONS WHY WE DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT I'M GONNA HOUSING WAS TO COME UP WITH REASONS WHY YOU CAN'T SUPPORT IT. I WORRY DEEPLY ABOUT THE PLANET MY CHILD THAT MY LITTLE GIRL IS GOING TO INHERIT. WE DON'T CAN'T AFFORD TO SAY NOTHING TO NOT TRY WE'VE GOT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR TO REFINE THIS AND MAKE THIS WORK WE'VE GOT A BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE THAT FIRST STEP. I IMPLORE YOU. FIND A WAY TO GET TO OUR TODAY BECAUSE IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN'T. CAN'T BE THE ONES TO START DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT IS IMPACTING OUR COASTLINES IN OUR COMMUNITY SO DEEPLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN. MISTER KING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FIFTY FOUR. AND I KNOW THAT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TO DO RECYCLING HERE IN THE STATE WE- COULD NEVER REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME BUT ALSO IN MANY WAYS HOW FAR WE HAVE YET TO GO. IN FACT REALLY WOULDN'T WE STARTED RECYCLING- IN THE SEVENTIES YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON WE'RE FOCUSED ON PAPER PRODUCTS. IN PRIMARILY BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. WELL NOW DURING THIS TIME OF KOBE I KNOW MANY OF US ARE DOING TAKE OUT I KNOW MANY OF US ARE USING- THESE SINGLE USE PLASTIC PRODUCTS AND LIKE MOST OF US WHO HAVE CURBSIDE RECYCLING WE EAT OUR WE ARE TAKE OUT. CLEAN OUT THE PLASTIC CONTAINER THE THROW IT INTO. OUR BLUE BIN. AND I THINK OUR MIND WE THINK THAT WE'VE DONE OUR JOB. WE'VE RECYCLE. WELL THE IRONY IS. ONLY 9% OF WHAT'S IN OUR BLUE BIN IS REALLY. IN RECYCLE AT ANY GIVEN TIME NOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM THOUSAND OAKS WE JUST PASSED A BILL TO. REALLY WORK ON THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER PARTY WHICH IS WHY THAT'S EXEMPTED IN THIS BILL TO REALLY ENCOURAGE MANUFACTURERS TO TAKE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY TO RE USE THE PLASTIC THAT THEY'RE PUTTING INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT. BUT SB FIFTY FOUR IS ANOTHER KEY PIECE. OF THAT SOLUTION. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ALL THOSE TAKE OUT CONTAINERS THAT WE SAY OH THIS IS PLASTIC. WE THINK WE CAN GO RECYCLE IT. DOESN'T RECYCLE. USED TO GO TO CHINA BECAUSE CHINA WAS BUYING A PLASTIC. THE CHILD A COUPLE YEARS AGO SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOT IN THE PLASTIC HERE. THE FROM OTHER PARTS OF WORLD ONE UP ON YOUR PLASTIC ANYMORE. SO YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING. IT'S GOING INTO THE LANDFILLS. IS NOT GOING TO BEING RECYCLED AT SOME RECYCLING PLANT IN THE SKY. IT'S GOING INTO YOUR LOCAL LEVEL. AND IF YOU THINK AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BURBANK ELOQUENTLY PUT IF YOU THINK THAT IT COMES AT ZERO COST TO US. RIGHT IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WE HAVE WHEN WE BY- MATTRESSES WILL WE HAVE MANY FACTORS THAT REALLY HELP MAKE SURE THAT THIS pALL THE PLASTIC PRODUCERS THERE IS NO. PRODUCER A MANUFACTURER SPOTS ABILITY THERE. THERE IS NO FEE FOR THE COST TO OUR SOCIETY FOR US. AS WE USE IT IN CONSUMERS WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DISPOSE OF IT. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THOSE COSTS. REALLY ME. YOU KNOW WHAT ONE STUDY IN ORANGE COUNTY FOUND THAT. RESIDENTS COULD SAVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SUMMER MONTHS JUST BY NOT. DESPITE NOT. JUST BY NOT LITTERING AND FOR ALL THIS TRASH OUT ON THE STREETS. AND IN FACT. ACROSS THE STATE MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SPENDING UPWARDS OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO CLEAN UP AND TO PREVENT LITTER. IN THE STREETS. SO WE CAN DO OUR PART TODAY. THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NOT TRASH ON THE STREETS IS TO NOT USE THAT PRODUCT. TO BEGIN WITH. THE MEASURE THAT WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT IS DISPOSABLE THAT IS COMPOSTABLE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS MUCH BETTER FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT. YEAH I THINK AGAIN LET US NOT HAVE THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. BECAUSE FTEN TIMES THAT'S WHAT WE ALWAYS HEAR THESE REALLY THESE LEGISLATIVE DEBATES WE HAVE CUT TO THE END OF THE LAST NIGHT OF SESSION. EVERYTHING IS WILL THIS BILL IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH THIS BILL IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH THE STAFF BECAUSE- THERE WERE THREE PROPOSALS AND ALTERNATIVES. OFFERED THIS IS THE ALTERNATIVE. THIS IS THE PROPOSAL. THE OTHER INDUSTRIES REALLY HAVEN'T COME FOR THE SAID HEY HERE'S ALTERNATIVE HERE'S WHAT WE THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING HERE ONCE YOU TRY IT THIS WAY WHAT OFTENTIMES WE KNOW IT'S POLICYMAKERS WE ARE STRUGGLING BY OURSELVES IN NEGOTIATING AGAINST OURSELVES. THIS IS A GOOD BILL IS A MUCH NEEDED BILL IT IS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY. NARROWED THE FOCUS ON PLASTICS. AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TIME IS NOW TO PASS SB FIFTY FOUR WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR TANG MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FIFTY FOUR AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN DIEGO AND FROM BURBANK FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL YOU KNOW. FOR ME. AS A FATHER. A LOT OF TIMES I. STRUGGLE TO JUSTIFY HOW MUCH TIME I HAVE TO SPEND UP HERE AWAY FROM MY FAMILY BUT THE YOU KNOW WHAT IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO FOR ME IS HOW. YOU KNOW IS MY WORK HERE GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. FOR MY DAUGHTER. YOU KNOW THIS PLASTIC POLLUTION. CRISIS IS TRULY A GLOBAL CRISIS. MAY WE HAVE SO MUCH PLASTIC ACCUMULATED. IN THE OCEAN THAT IS FORMED IT'S OWN ISLAND. WE HAVE SO MUCH PLASTIC THAT IS POLLUTING AND ENDING UP IN OUR WATERWAYS ON OUR BEACHES THAT IT'S YOU KNOW. IT DOESN'T BIODEGRADE IT IT IT JUST CRUMBLES AND ENDS UP IN OUR WATER SUPPLY IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR FOOD SUPPLY THERE IS PLASTIC IN OUR FISH AND OUR FOOD SUPPLY THAT'S HOW BAD THIS PLASTIC CRISIS IS BECOMING. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND FIGHTING THIS GLOBAL CRISIS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION. AND I AM PROUD TO JOIN THIS EFFORT WITH SB FIFTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISS AMERICA FIFTEEN MISTER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I TO WANT TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT OF- THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL SB FIFTY FOUR- PLASTIC GOT POLLUTION IS AN ISSUE THAT- MANY OF US IN THIS- IN THIS CHAMBER HAVE WORKED ON CERTAINLY I HAVE WORKED ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW IN MY LITTLE. SUBSPECIALTY OF THE PLASTICS WORLD AS MICROPLASTICS IN THE MEMBER FROM THE SOUTH BAY WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT IT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE GOOD SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW FOR MICROPLASTICS THE CLOTHING THAT. MANY OF US ARE WEARING SHED PLASTIC. THAT A DOWN INTO OUR WATERWAYS OUT INTO THE OCEAN AND ARE CONSUMED BY FISH AND IT'S BECOMING PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND THAT WE MUST PLASTICS THERE. ARE CHEAP TO PRODUCE AND THEY'RE EVERYWHERE THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. SO I IMPLORE YOU TO. VOTE FOR THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE WHICH WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA NOT JUST AS A NATIONAL LEADER AS ONE OF THE SPEAKERS MENTIONED CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE INTER NATIONAL LEADER ON THIS IF WE PASS THIS BILL IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I ASK THAT FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU MR ROOM MR COOLEY ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I'M PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I WAS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL LAST FALL WAITED FOR ON THIS FLOOR. I FEEL LIKE. I'M GETTING TOO DARN OLD. THIS BILL HAS PRODUCED AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE FOR ME. LAST YEAR PRODUCES EXPERIENCE IT BROUGHT ME TO MY YOUTH I REMEMBER CAMPING WITH MY FAMILY WHICH MEANS MY MOM DAD THREE BROUGHT. UP INTO AS A LITTLE BOY. AND I REMEMBER MY FIRST EXT OF MAD MAGAZINE WAS THIS SCRAP OF A MAD MAGAZINE BLEW THROUGH OUR CAMPSITE. AND I STARTED LOOKING AT. AND IT WAS A CARTOON. ABOUT TRASH. AND THE AND THE THRUST OF THIS LITTLE MAD MAGAZINE CARTOON WAS ABOUT THE GRAND CANYON. WAS GONNA FILL UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE TRASH. NOT COURSE THAT'S JUST A LUDICROUS NOTION TO THINK THAT THE GRAND CANYON WOULD FILL UP. WHEN YOU'RE SIX OR SEVEN I WAS AN ASTONISHING IDEA. TO THINK THAT THERE COULD BE SO MUCH TRASH IN A WORLD OF SOMETHING. THAT EVEN I KNEW ABOUT. COULD BE IMPAIR. YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT PLASTICS OF COURSE IS THE- THERE'S ALMOST NO PRODUCT. I GUESS I CAN'T SAY THAT IN A ROLE IN THE WORLD THE INTERNET BUT THERE ARE FEW PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD. THAT ARE SUCH A MARVEL. OF HUMAN INNOVATION. CREATIVITY THE ABILITY TO FIND SOMETHING WHERE NO ONE EVER SAW BEFORE. THE WHOLE ALL THE WE HAVE IN THE WORLD THE RISE FOR PLASTICS IT'S A BY PRODUCT OF. APPLIED SCIENCE CHEMISTRY HUMAN INGENUITY. AND SO I FIND IT. THE FACT IS IT'S DNA. THAT WE ARRIVE AT THESE THINGS BECAUSE OF THE MARVELS OF HUMAN INGENUITY WHY NOT BRING THAT TO BEAR AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY ON DEALING WITH THIS PROFUSION. IN THE WORLD. I HAVE FIVE GRANDKIDS RANGING FROM TWO TO TEN. THIS IS A MATTER THAT. WILL AFFECT THEIR LIVES THIS IS ACTUALLY A MATTER OF THAT THIS IS A POLICY ERROR WERE CALIFORNIA. CAN REACH. A CROSS OUR STATE. CROSSED OUR NATION ROSS THE BLOW TWO PATHFINDER. SOLUTIONS TO WHAT IS INCONTESTABLE A PROBLEM. SO I AM PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN LIFE THAT. APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL YOU JUST UNDERTAKE TO DO IT. AND YOU PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN TO START WITH YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT IS THIS ISSUE I THINK THAT IS. THIS TIME. AND. LAST WEEK I READ A QUOTE DURING THAT WAY TOO LONG REFLECTION AT THE START OF SESSION. THE PROBABLY ZIPPED BY EVERYBODY BUT IT WAS AN HONOR OF AN ARCTIC EXPLORER. WHO TRAVEL TO NORTH POLE WITH COMMODORE PERRY. MATTHEW HENSON. AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU WHAT WHAT THE VIEW OF AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS FOR MATTHEW HINDERS HANSON SAID ABOUT. LIFE AND PEOPLE. BECAUSE I'M A INVOKE HIS WORDS. FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO ON THIS DEBATE. LIFE IS GROWTH LIFE IS PROGRESS IN PROGRESS DEPENDS ON NEW IDEAS. WITHOUT THE ADVENT OF NEW IDEAS WE SHOULD STILL BE RIDING AND STAGECOACHES. AND READING BY THE LIGHT OF TALLOW CANDLES. GREAT IDEALS OF THE GLORIA VAN ALONE. QUOTED MATTHEW HENSON. NOR THE CREATURE COULD HAVE THEM ONLY MAN CAN GET A VISION AND AN INSPIRATION WILL LIFT HIM ABOVE THE LEVEL OF HIMSELF. AND SEND THEM FORTH AGAINST ALL OPPOSITION OR ANY DISBURSEMENT. TO DO AND TO DARE AND ACCOMPLISHED WONDERFUL AND GREAT THING FOR THE WORLD AND FOR HUMANITY. COLLEAGUES THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IT IS A PRODUCT OF HUMAN INGENUITY AND I THINK IT'S PAST TIME THAT HUMAN INGENUITY BE CONCENTRATED ON TRYING TO MAKE. PROGRESS ON IT. AND THEREBY ESTABLISHING THAT. THE IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY ERROR EXPRESSED HERE IN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE WORKING ON A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL THOSE ON THIS PLANET- TO RIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER CROWLEY MISTER STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS WE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THE MYTHOLOGY FOR DECADES. AND THAT MYTHOLOGY IS THAT OUR TRASH PROBLEMS STARTED WITH THE LITTER PROGRAMME IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AND THE MYTHOLOGY THAT'S BEEN DRIVEN BY THE INDUSTRY IS THAT OUR TRASH PROBLEM IS OUR FAULT AS INDIVIDUALS AS LITERATURES AND YES THAT IS A COMPONENT. BUT IT IS SO MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE. AND COMPLICATED THAN THAT AND IF WE STILL BUY INTO THAT MYTHOLOGY WE MISS THE POINT THAT WE HAVE NOT BROUGHT ALL PLAYERS INTO THE EQUATION ON HOW WE DEAL WITH TRASH WITH WASTE AND ESPECIALLY WITH PLASTIC. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE THE FRAMEWORK. TO HAVE MANUFACTURERS PRODUCERS PACKAGING PACKAGERS ALL BE A PART OF SOLUTIONS TO REDUCING PLASTIC IN OUR ENVIRONMENT THAT IS WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT HERE. AND IF EVERYONE THROUGH THAT SUPPLY CHAIN. REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC THAT NGUYEN IN THE PACKAGING THAT WENT INTO PRODUCTS. TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHERE THAT PLASTIC DOES AND NOT JUST PUT IT ON TAXPAYERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE IN THE END FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT AND FOR CLEAN UP. BUT CAME UP WITH REAL SOLUTIONS AND WE TO CREATE MARKETS FOR THE PLASTICS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND SET HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO USE PLASTICS AND POST CONSUMER CONTENT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT GETTING RID OF PLASTICS ALTOGETHER UNFORTUNATELY I WOULD LOVE TO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY SINGLE USE CONTAINERS AND SINGLE USE PLASTICS THAT WE SEEM TO BE ADDICTED TO. THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF THIS BILL HOWEVER THIS BILL IS THAT FRAMEWORK THAT WE CAN ENGAGE ALL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY AND THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. AND ENSURE THAT EVERYONE PLAYS THEIR PART AND THOSE WHO ARE MAKING PROFITS OFF OF THIS THESE PRODUCTS THOSE WHO ARE USING THESE PRODUCTS AND THOSE ARE THROWING AWAY THESE PRODUCTS ALL HAVE A ROLE IN REDUCING PLASTIC IN OUR ENVIRONMENT THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO CRITICAL. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SOMETHING WE MUST PASS HERE TODAY AND MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS SHOWING THE REST OF THE WORLD WHAT WE CAN DO AND WE CAN ALL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY ACROSS ECONOMIC SECTORS FOR OUR TRASH PROBLEM OUR WASTE PROBLEMS AND THIS DID DETRIMENTAL PROBLEM OF PLASTIC IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU MR STERN IS CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I GREW UP IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES I AM OF THE CAPTAIN PLANET GENERATION. I GREW UP WHEN I WAS A JUST ABOUT NINE OR TEN YEARS OLD I WAS ABLE TO GO TO MY FIRST EVER CAMPING TRIP ON CATALINA ISLAND I HAD NEVER BEEN. I IT WAS A MARINE BIOLOGY CAMP WHERE I FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAW A TURTLE. THAT WAS COMPLETELY MISSHAPEN. BECAUSE THEY HAD GOTTEN TIED. IN RIGHT AROUND THE VALLEY. WITH THE- WHAT IS SIX SODA. PLASTIC CONTAINER THING IS THE GUY WITH THE CIRCLES. AND I LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A YOUNG CHILD TO GO HOME AND CUT. BILL SIX. US CIRCLES THE PLASTIC BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT THAT IT HAD. ON OUR MARINE LIFE THAT CHANGED ME. AS A YOUNG GIRL AND I WENT BACK HOME. TO MY WORKING CLASS FAMILY IN EAST LA. LATINO IMMIGRANT HOUSEHOLD. PERHAPS OF THE ORIGINAL OF RECYCLERS OF CONTAINERS BECAUSE TO GO TO ANY OF THE KITCHENS OF ANY GALLETAS HOUSING YOU OPEN UP A BUTTER CONTAINER IT MAY NOT BE BETTER IT MAY BE FRIJOLES MAY FOR SON SOMETHING. BUT THAT IS WHAT WE DO WITH THE COMMUNITY. I AM SOMEONE RE WASHES THE BLOOD BAGS. I AM SOMEBODY THAT TRIES TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY. TO DO WHAT I CAN. TO CONSERVE. AND TO HELP SAVE OUR ENVIRONMENT. EVEN AS A NINE YEAR OLD WHEN I CAME BACK HOME TO MY FAMILY. MY MOM AND DAD. ENCOURAGED THAT I DO THE BEST THAT I COULD TO RECYCLE. AND WHEN THIS BILL CAME UP LAST YEAR. I LEARNED THAT EVEN WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS RECYCLING. I WASN'T REALLY RECYCLING BECAUSE- BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY CONTAMINATED I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU BUY A PIZZA BOX. AND YOU THINK IT'S CARDBOARD AND YOU PUT IN YOUR RECYCLING BIN IT ACTUALLY CANNOT BE RECYCLED. BECAUSE THEY DON'T IT'S ALREADY CONTAMINATED. SO THE PUBLIC AND I THINK A LOT OF US IN THIS ROOM. FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT WE THINK RECYCLING IS. BUT TO BE QUITE HONEST. WE ALL NEED A RE EDUCATION ON WHAT THAT IS AND HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK ON REAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT HAVE A REAL IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE NATION AND BE A LEADER IN THE WORLD. I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR. I THINK THAT. YES THERE ARE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO RESOLVE THERE IS FUNDING THERE NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE. WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SO I AM HERE TO SAY THAT EVEN WORKING CLASS FAMILIES WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES. WANT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND HAVE CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER CLEAN OCEANS. AND IT'S NOT FAIR THEY WHEN YOU GROW UP IN THE INNER CITY. AND YOUR MAYBE IN THIRD GRADE YOUR FIRST EXPERIENCE AND THE BEACH IS TO CLEAN IT UP. I REMEMBER BEING LITTLE. GROWING UP IN EAST LA GETTING ON A SCHOOL BUS. GOING TO CABRILLO BEACH TO CLEAN IT UP. THERE WAS PLASTIC. THEIR CIGARETTES THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF TRASH.WHY IS IT THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF A YOUNG GIRL FROM THE INNER CITY. SHOULD BE CLEANING UP A BEACH. THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF COMMUNITY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE IT IS NOT THE TYPE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE SHOULD BE AND WE ARE ALL ENTITLED AND HAVE A RIGHT. TO HAVE A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT FREE OF POLLUTION AND FREE OF PLASTIC IN OUR OCEANS. THANK YOU. IN THIS ROOM IS KAMLAGER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FIFTY FOUR AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR. YOU KNOW WE OUR COUNTRY OUR PLANET. HAS BECOME BLOATED FROM PLASTIC. I MEAN WE ARE ADDICTED TO IT. AND WE HAVE GOT TO PUT SOME REAL SKIN IN THE GAME. IF WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. IT IS TAKING OVER IT IS TAKING OVER OUR LAND IT IS TAKING OVER OUR OCEANS IT IS TAKING OVER OUR BODIES. I CAME INTO THIS CONVERSATION A YEAR AGO THE BILL WAS INCREDIBLY ASPIRATIONAL. EVEN FOR THE MOST GRANOLA OF US. AND WE WORKED AND LISTENED WE LISTEN TO THE OPPOSITION WE LISTEN TO FOLKS WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AND WE FIGURED OUT A PATHWAY THAT MADE SENSE. THAT WAS REASONABLE. AND THAT PUT SOME SKIN IN THE GAME FOR MANUFACTURERS AND FOR DISTRIBUTORS AND FOR THE STATE AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS. AND SO IT'S ALMOST DISINGENUOUS FOR FOLKS. TO WANT TO POOH POOH THIS RECOGNIZING HOW MUCH WORK. HAS BEEN PUT INTO MAKING SOMETHING OUT OF THIS BILL THAT IS REASONABLE THAT IS MANAGEABLE THAT IS STILL ASPIRATIONAL ASPIRATIONAL AND STILL SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE DYING LITERALLY. FROM OVERCONSUMPTION AND-OVERPRODUCTION OF PLASTIC. WE'VE SEEN THE VIDEOS WE HAVE OUR OWN STORIES WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE PLASTIC IN OUR OWN HOMES. AND LORD KNOWS WITH COAL BED WE HAVE PROBABLY SEEN OUR FAIR SHARE OF PLASTIC BOTTLES IN CARDBOARD BOXES BECAUSE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GETTING DELIVERED TO US WHEN WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GO OUT. WE ARE BECOMING PART OF THE LARGER PROBLEM FAR QUICKER. THEN WE ARE WORKING TO BECOME PART OF THE SOLUTION IN SB FIFTY FOUR IS A REASONABLE STEP TOWARDS THAT SOLUTION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON S. NO NO I CAN'T SAY THAT BUT I'M GOING TO SAY YEAH YOU'LL NEED TO VOTE FOR THIS WHEN THIS COES UP IT WOULD MAKE NO SENSE NOT TO. THANK YOU MATT CAGR MISTER CARTER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU AYE I JUST WANT TO ADD THREE QUICK THINGS TO THE TO THE DEBATE THE FIRST IS. IT WHEN YOU LOOK. AT OUR KIDS TODAY AND WHEN THEY COME AND TALK ABOUT SO FAR AS MOTHER EARTH AND THE PLASTIC. CRISIS THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR GLOBE THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL LOOK AT THIS ISSUE WILL DEBATE LIKE WHAT WAS THE BIG ISSUE. BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN I THINK LOOKING BACK ABOUT THAT TIME KNOW THAT WE HAD EASILY ADAPTED TO. SECOND IF YOU LOOK AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE SAID THE COSTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER I WENT IN TOWARD. OUR TRANSFER STATION AND THEY HAD THE PLASTIC BAGS GETTING STUCK IN THE WHEELS AND THEY HAD TO SHUT THEM DOWN. EVERY TWO HOURS NOW SOMEBODY CLIMB IN THERE AND PULL OUT THE PLASTIC FROM THESE LITTLE WHEELS. THAT ARE JUST WRECKING HAVOC AND ASKED HOW MUCH IT COST AND IT IS ONE SITE IT THINK IT WAS LIKE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN LOST PRODUCTIVITY. FROM SHUTTING DOWN THE MACHINERY TO PULL THE PLASTIC OUT SO WE ARE PAYING FOR THAT COST TODAY. AND LASTLY. AS OUR AS OUR FLOOR MANAGER NOTED. THIS BILL SETS A TIMELINE IN THE FUTURE AND I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN. THAT THE ILAN MOSQUE SAID THE WORLD WHOEVER ELSE. CAN FIGURE IT OUT. IF WE CAN MAKE STRAWS OUT OF BAMBOO AND CONTAINERS OUT OF THESE SWAY MATERIAL WILL LOOK BACK ON THIS AND I'M I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT GIVEN A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE RESOURCE WERE PUTTING INTO THIS AND THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE WILL EASILY FIND SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH ARE. ARE SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTE OBSESSION AND PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CARTY SEEING HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE. I'M NOT CLOSE WITH THIS I KNOW THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE I'M WELL AWARE. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WHIPSAWED ON AMENDMENTS FROM THE DATE WE INTRODUCED THIS- NO WE CAN'T DO THIS- WILL JUST BE THERE IF YOU DO THIS WE'LL GET THERE DON'T ADD DON'T ADD THE GLASS WE CAN'T HAVE GLASS ADD GLASS IF YOU DON'T HAVE GLASS WE WON'T BE THERE. TAKE OUT THE FARMERS- THAT'S NOT ENOUGH SO MANY FARMERS GOING TO CURBSIDE RECYCLING YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. I AM TIRED. OF MAKING THE CASE YOU EITHER BELIEVE THE PLASTICS OF THE PROBLEM. THE GLOBAL WARMING IS A REAL PROBLEM BECAUSE THIS DOES CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE YOU EITHER BELIEVE THERE IS A GARBAGE PATCH IN OUR OCEAN AND WE NEED TO START TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OR YOU DON'T. BECAUSE WE SET OUT A TIMELINE TO DO SOMETHING IN IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH FOR THE LOBBYISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I'VE SEEN THAT WITH MY OWN EYES I HAVE AMENDED AND WE HAVE AMENDED THIS BILL OVER AND OVER. TO TRY TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEBODY'S CONCERNED WHO JUST PUTS IN ANOTHER OPPOSITION LETTER BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH. THIS IS IN THE FUTURE WE KNOW WE CAN CREATE A MARKET WE KNOW THAT WE CAN CREATE JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM. AND IT'S NOT A WHITE POST PROBLEM DON'T GOING TO ME WITH THAT. BECAUSE I HAVE A BROWN COMMUNITY THAT IS DIRTY AS CRAP. WITH YOUR PLASTICS. IT'S DIRTY BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE TO PUT THEM. THERE IN OUR WATER WAYS THEY'RE COMING OUT OF OUR TRASH CANS ARE COMING OUT OF OUR LANDFILLS ARE LANDFILLS ARE PULLED UP HOW MUCH IS YOUR CITY OR COUNTY SPENDING. TO DO NOTHING WITH THESE BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM HOW LONG CAN THAT LAST. IF YOU WANT TO WAIT TILL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND LET THE COMPANY PUT SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT THAT'S GOING TO PASS THAT'S FINE OR WE CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IF YOU WANT TO LOOK IN THE EYES OF YOUR KID AND I PROMISE YOU IF YOU HAVE A KID THEY KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM. THEY'RE COMING TO YOU TO TELL YOU IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT FIND VOTE NO OR OR JUST STAY OFF YOU KNOW I'M JUST GOING TO WAIT AND SEE WHERE IT'S AT THAT'S FINE BUT I'VE HAD ENOUGH IF YOU WANT TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM.

THIS BILL AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN ESTABLISHES COVED NINETEEN FOR MIDDLE PAID SICK LEAVE FOR FOOD SECTOR WORKERS AND OTHER COVERED WORKERS THESE WORKERS WERE EXCLUDED FROM PAID SICK LEAVE PORTIONS OF THE FEDERAL FAMILIES FIRST CORONAVIRUS THE RESPONSE ACT PROVIDES TWO ADDITIONAL WEEKS OF SICK LEAVE AND THE PROVISIONS EXPIRE ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY OR UPON EXPIRATION OF ANY FEDERAL EXTENSION WHICHEVER IS LATER. REQUIRES THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO ENFORCE THE COVERED NINETEEN SUBLIMINAL PAID SICK LEAVE PROVISIONS ADDITIONALLY CREATES A FAMILY LEAVE MEDIATION PILOT PROGRAM FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS WITH FIVE TO NINETEEN EMPLOYEES ALLOWING THE EMPLOYER OR EMPLOYEES TO REQUESTED MEDIATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING PRIOR TO AN EMPLOYEE FILING A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THE PROVISION WOULD ONLY BECOME OPERATIVE ONLY IF S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH PROVIDES A BROADCASTING SYSTEM FAMILY PROVISIONS IS ENACTED THE PROVISION SUNSET ON JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK RICH CHIANG MR. OR REX. THANK MISTER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO A S. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN THIS TRAILER BILL WILL REQUIRE LARGE EMPLOYERS AND FOOD SECTOR EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY HOURS OF PAID. SUPPLEMENTAL DRAVID NINETEEN SICK LEAVE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. FIRST OF ALL THIS BILL IS AN ABUSE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BUDGET. IT CONTAINS BUT A SINGLE TOKEN APPROPRIATION OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THAT WE CAN POINT AT AND SAY LOOK IT'S A BUDGET BILL BUT THIS IS A SUBSTANTIVE POLICY BILL AND COLLEAGUES. WE HAVE BEEN DEBATING CORONAVIRUS VIRUS RELIEF LEGISLATION FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS UNCONSCIONABLE THEY WERE USING THE BUDGET PROCESS TO TRY AND FORCES THROUGH THE LAST MINUTE. IF YOU WONDER WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AT. SIX FIFTEEN PM IT'S BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY PUT IN PLANT. ON FRIDAY EVENING. THERE WAS HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE YESTERDAY. SECOND OF ALL ALTHOUGH I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE DESIRE. TO MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR THE WORKERS OF CALIFORNIA IT IS WRONG TO PUT THIS BOLD BURDEN ON THE SHOULDER OF AN INDUSTRY THAT IS ALREADY REELING. THE FOOD SECTOR INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SUFFERING SEVERE CONSEQUENCES OF THE GOVERNMENT OPPOSE SHUT DOWN FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND IF YOU WANT PROOF OF THAT JUST WALK AROUND SACRAMENTO AMBROSIA. CLOSE PERMANENTLY TWO WEEKS AGO. EMPRESS TAVERN CLOSED PERMANENTLY TWO WEEKS AGO. MAHJONG IS CLOSED PERMANENTLY LAST WEEK. IF WE TAKE MEASURES LIKE THIS AND WE EXPECTING PLAYERS TO PICK UP THE SLACK PARTICULARLY EMPLOYERS THAT ARE ALREADY DOING POORLY THE CONSEQUENCE WILL BE MORE AND MORE OF THESE BUSINESSES WILL CLOSE ARJUN OVER.

FILE ITEM FORTY NINE SB ONE FORTY FIVE THE CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL ONE FORTY FIVE BY CENTER WIENER AN ACCOLADE THE SEX OFFENDERS. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL ONE FORTY FIVE WHICH WILL IN CALIFORNIA'S. HIGHLY DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC FACTS ACCESS BY OUR STATE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY LAW. BY GIVING COURTS DISCRETION OVER ALL CASES INVOLUNTARY INTERCOURSE BETWEEN TEENAGERS. AND YOUNG ADULTS UNDER CURRENT LAW FOR YOUNG PERSON OF VOLUNTARY SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH A MINOR. AGE FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN AND IS NO MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLDER THAN THE MINOR THE OFFENSE. IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY REGISTRABLE HOWEVER THE COURT HAS DISCRETION BASED ON THE FACTS OF THE CASE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO PLACE THE DEFENDANT. ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. ON THE OTHER HAND IF ANY OTHER SEX AT IS PERFORMED IN IT IS MANDATORY THAT THE COURT PLACED THE DEFENDANT ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. REGARDLESS OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE. THIS DISPARATE TREATMENT OF THE SEX SEX IS A VESTIGE FROM THE ANTI LGBT LAWS IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES. THAT CRIMINALIZED. GAY SEX. TRAGICALLY IN TWENTY NINETEEN- LAW STILL MANDATE THAT A YOUNG PERSON IN A CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP WHO WAS CONVICTED OF PERFORMING THESE SPECIFIC SEX ACTS. MUST BE PLACED ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY AND OUR COURTS ARE BARRED FROM USING DISCRETION. THE WORD WE LIKE SO MUCH TO KEEP THEM OFF EVEN THOUGH A SIMILARLY SITUATED YOUNG PERSON CONVICTED OF STATUTORY RAPE WOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME RESTRICTION. THIS DISTINCTION IN THE LAW IS IRRATIONAL AND DISCRIMINATORY TOWARDS LGBT YOUTH AS IT TREATS THESE ACTS AND MORE AGREED YES. OF A CRIME IN STATUTORY RAPE. SB ONE FORTY FIVE IN BLATANT BLATANT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST YOUNG PEOPLE ENGAGED INVOLUNTARY SEXUAL ACTIVITY BY GIVING COURTS THE DISCRETION TO DECIDE AT SENTENCING. IT REGISTERING THE DEFENDANT AS A SEX OFFENDER IS APPROPRIATE REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT THEY PERFORMED. TO BE CLEAR NOTHING IN THIS BILL DE CRIMINALIZES ANY OF THESE OFFENSES OR PREVENTS ANYONE FROM BEING PLACED ON THE REGISTRY IF A PROSECUTOR RECOMMENDS IT OR THE COURT ORDERS IT. SB FORTY FIVE AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT SPONSORED. AND SUPPORTED BAIL. I ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER CAMARGO MISS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER I UNFORTUNATELY I'M IN RISING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND I WOULDN'T HAVE SPOKN EXCEPT THAT PEOPLE HAVE MISCONSTRUED MY OPPOSITION SO I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. THE EQUITY ARGUMENT THAT EQUALITY CALIFORNIA OTHERS A PROMOTED FOR THIS BILL I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH IN FACT I AGREE WITH IT SO MUCH THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY GAVE ME TO TAKE IN APPROPRIATIONS WHICH WHAT IS STILL CREATED A TWO TIER SYSTEM I REFUSED TO TAKE BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS. ANY SEX IS SEX I DON'T CARE WHO IT'S BETWEEN OR WHAT SEX ACTED AS THAT BEING SAID I CANNOT IN MY MIND AS A MOTHER UNDERSTAND HOW SEX BETWEEN A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD AND A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD COULD EVER BE CONSENSUAL HOW IT COULD EVER NOT BE A REGISTRABLE OFFENCE I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF SEX IT IS I DON'T CARE IF IT'S- TRADITIONAL I DON'T EVEN I YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD HAS SEX WITH A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD IT IS ALWAYS IN AND AN EQUITABLE SITUATION MOST THE TIME IT'S A TEACHER AND STUDENT IT MIGHT BE A BIBLE STUDY INSTRUCTOR COACH IN A STUDENT I'VE HAD FOURTEEN YEAR OLD I'VE ASKED EVERYBODY AS THIS IS THAT MY COMMITTEE FOR TWO YEARS A MAN BOTH SIDES OF THE BILL. ANAND THE CURRENT SITUATION WHERE WHERE ONE SEX ACT BETWEEN A TWENTY FOUR TO FOURTEEN YEAR OLD MIGHT BE CONSIDERED CONSENSUAL BY A JUDGE AND AMEND THIS SO WE CAN HAVE EQUITY BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE EQUITABLE. BUT WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP ON THIS IDEA. THE CHILDREN ARE NOT. IT SHOULD BE. ANY WAY. SUB TO A PREDATOR IN THAT'S WHAT IT IS I CAN NOT AND I'VE NEVER HEARD IN A CHALLENGE EVERYBODY GIVE ME A SITUATION WHERE TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD HAD SEX WITH A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD ANY KIND OF SEX AND WASN'T PREDATORY ANY EXAMPLE AND I'VE YET TO SEE IT. I HAVE BEEN THE MOTHER OF A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I'M SORRY INTEL YOU CAN SHOW ME THAT I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS BILL AS MUCH AS I WANT TO CREATE AN EQUITABLE SITUATION I THINK THIS IS GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A BOTH PORTIONS OF THE CODE AND MAKE A DETERMINATION. I UNDERSTAND IT LEAVES IT UP TO A JUDGE IT LEAVES IT UP TO A JUDGE I STILL HAVE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE INSTANCE BY WHICH A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD SHOULD BE HAVING SEX WITH A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER NO VOTE. THANK YOU MATH GONZALES. MISTER TROY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU SPEAKER AND A MEMBER SOLVE GET SOMEBODY I STAND TODAY IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. ONE FORTY FIVE. POLITICS ARE AS A LIFELONG EDUCATOR WE PLACE ALL DON'T START IN PLACES SOLVE OUR TRUST. WITH A AND A- IN ON AGE OF HISTORIC US SEX TRAFFICKING AND A CHILD IS TRAFFICKING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS SET ENTIRELY IN APPROPRIATE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD THE VOLUNTEER OF COURTS. SHOULD NOT HAVE TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER FOR BEING UP WITH A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD STUDENT. STATUTORY RAPE ALL SHOULD BE OUR- REGISTER A MORE OFFENSIVE EITHER WAY AND A BY IMPLORING THIS OFFENSE COLLEAGUES SO WE ARE SIGNALING TO FAMILIES AND THE CHILDREN EVERYWHERE THAT THE WE SUPPORT THAT IS SO ABUSIVE WITH SITUATIONS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUMMARY. OF THIS BILL IT TO PROVIDES THAT THE PRESENCE OF A CONVICTED OF LAW SODOMY ORAL COPULATION WHAT SEXUAL PENETRATION BY FOREIGN OBJECT. ON THE SPECIFIED THE PROVISIONS OF ONE ALL WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER SO. IF WHAT AT THE TIME OF ALL FANS THE PERSON IS ON NOT MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLDER THAN THE MINOR. AND THE CONVICTION IS SO OFTEN THE ONE REQUIRING THE PERSON TO REGISTER. I'M IN THIS IS SO UNBELIEVABLE WHAT KIND OF A BILL LEASES SO WHAT KIND OF OUR LOW SO WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO. AMERICA BY THIS BODY THIS IS ARE INTOLERABLE. IT IS SOLVABLE SINCE ABOUT AYE RESPECTIVELY AYE BAG YOU'LL TO VOTE NO YES THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER. CHINA'S FRIEDMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. CERTAINLY THIS IS A DIFFICULT BILL AND IT'S A DIFFICULT SUBJECT. I'M ALSO A MOM AND I AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO IMAGINE A SITUATION. WHERE SEX BETWEEN A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD AND A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD COULD BE CONSENSUAL I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT EXISTS. HOWEVER WHAT CURRENT LAW SAYS IS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE FOR A JUDGE TO DECIDE THAT SEX BETWEEN A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD MAN AND A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL IS CONSENSUAL. BUT SEX BETWEEN A NINETEEN YEAR OLD MAN. AND A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOY. MUST LEAD TO THAT NINETEEN YEAR OLD BEING PLACED ON THE SEX REGISTRY FOR LIFE. THAT IS WHY THE CURRENT LAW IS NOT EQUITABLE. IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE JUDGE'S RULING THAT SEX BETWEEN A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD AND A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD OF ANY GENDER IS ALLOWABLE WE SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LAW AND CHANGING THAT LAW. BUT THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION THAT IS IN FRONT OF US NOW. THE QUESTION THAT'S IN FRONT OF US NOW IS WHY ARE WE TREATING SEX BETWEEN TWO SAME GENDERED PEOPLE COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY THAN SEX BETWEEN. A MAN AND A WOMAN THAT IS THE QUESTION IN FRONT OF US NOW AND THAT IS NOT JUSTIFIABLE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR VALUES IN THE STATE. AND YES THERE ARE CASES. WHERE THEY STATE IS WASTING RESOURCES MONITORING AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WHO'S ON THE REGISTRY BECAUSE HE HAD SEX WITH A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD-BOYFRIEND. THAT IS FACTUAL CASES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS WHY THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN BY SURVIVORS ADVOCATES IN BY CHILDREN NOW AND THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE HAVE DANGEROUS SEX OFFENDERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT NEED MONITORING BUT A FOR WASTING OUR TIME MONITORING EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WHO HAD SEX WITH SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHICH BY THE WAY IF IT WAS A- YOUNG MAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN WOULD NOT BE ON THE REGISTRY BUT IT IS BECAUSE THEY WERE THE SAME GENDER. WE ARE NOT USING VALUABLE RESOURCES MONITORING TRULY DANGEROUS SEXUAL PREDATORS SO LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL IS AND WHAT THIS BILL IS NOT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF HYPERBOLE IN A LOT OF EMOTIONS OVER IT THAT ARE GETTING IN THE WAY. OF US SEEING THAT THIS IS PURELY AN EQUITY ISSUE IT IS NOT DECRIMINALIZING STATUTORY RAPE BY ANY EXTENT WITHOUT AYE ORIGIN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN. MISTER MERRETT CG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A FORMER CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FORTY FIVE NOW I USUALLY DO NOT RIGHTS IN SUPPORT OF A BILL FROM SENATOR WIENER ON A SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION ISSUE BUT- THIS IS AN EXCEPTION AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE POINTED OUT THIS IS TRYING TO. RECTIFY THIS OUTDATED INEQUITY BETWEEN STRAIGHT SEX VERSUS GAY SEX I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS MADE BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO AS A PARENT IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE. ANYTHING THAT THE- WOULD NOT BE PROUDER A GIVEN SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE SHE DESCRIBED. BUT AGAIN I MEAN THIS GIVE THE JUST THE JUDGE THE- YOU KNOW AND AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR I KNOW THAT- I HAVE PROSECUTED CASES WHERE I FELT BAD THAT. THERE WOULD BE A- POTENTIAL LIFETIME DESIGNATION THE SCARLET LETTER ON SOMEONE L. AS A SEX OFFENDER REGISTER FOR LIFE. YOU KNOW WHEN. IT INVOLVED CONSENSUAL SEX I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS BILL IS. COSPONSORED BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. HOME YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN IT WHEN WE START GETTING THESE QUESTIONS OF EQUITY IN AND HOW WELL BALANCED THIS IS FOR EVERYONE. YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE SOME GOOD POINTS WHEN YOU BRING UP. THE HANDFUL OF CASES. WHERE IT'S WITHIN A FEW YEARS. BUT WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT THIS HILLIARD GAS. THAT THIS OPENS UP. IT TEARS AT THE MORAL FIBER. OF OUR STATE OF OUR COMMUNITY. OF OUR FAMILIES. IN THIS BILL JUST GOES TOO FAR. I ASK YOU ALL TO CONSIDER THAT THINK ABOUT IT. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL. IF IT WAS YOUR FOURTEEN YEAR OLD. IN SOMEBODY WAS TEN YEARS OLDER THAN THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS MR MAYS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. SOME THANK YOU A MATTIS BEAKER AND MEMBERS- I RISE SIDE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. BUT I DID NOT LAST WEEK A SUPPORT- THIS BILL- BECAUSE UNLIKE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE ATTORNEYS UNLIKE SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE- WHERE PROSECUTORS SOME OF WHOM DEFENSE ATTORNEYS UNDERSTAND THE LAW SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO WERE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SOMETIMES THESE SORTS OF BILLS- ARE BILLS THAT. ARE CHALLENGING FOR US BUT I FOUND THIS ONE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WAS IN SUPPORT. AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S INTERESTING WHY ARE THE PROSECUTORS. UP ACROSS THE STATE THE ORGANIZATION SUPPORTING THIS BILL SO I THOUGHT YOU KNOW I'M GONNA REACH OUT TO MY TWO D. A.'S SO I CALLED OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND I CALLED THE SALMON YOU KNOW COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SPOKE WITH BOTH OF THEM. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT ONE OF THOSE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S AS AN EXPERT IN THE SEX CRIMES CASES. AND HE SAID CHAD I NEED TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME JUST DIGGING INTO THIS. AND AFTER HE DID HE CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY SPENT FIFTEEN MINUTES WITH ME GOING THROUGH IT AND HE SAID THIS BILL IS RIGHTEOUS AND IT IS JUST THIS COMING FROM A CONSERVATIVE. PROSECUTOR. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF BILLS MEMBERS. THAT IS VERY EASY FOR US POLITICALLY TO TAKE A PASS ON. IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS FOR SURE YOU'RE GOING TO GET A HIT I'M GONNA TAKE A HIT BECAUSE I'M VOTING FOR TONIGHT. I GUARANTEE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A HIT ON THIS BILL BUT AT SOME MOMENT IN TIME IT'S OUR JOB WE SEE THIS ALL THE TIME IT'S OUR THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S RESPONSIBILITY. TO MAKE GOOD LAWS THAT'S WHAT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS SAYS JUST IN FRONT OF US THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS YOU WILL TAKE A POLITICAL HIT FOR. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S RIGHTEOUS. AND IT IS JUST THIS IS THE TIME TO STEP UP. AND I URGE AND I VOTE THIS EVENING. THANK YOU MR MAYOR. SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER THIS CAMARGO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE ROBUST. DISCRETION ON THIS BILL IT'S ALWAYS HARD ON THIS FLOOR TO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK SOME FOLKS STILL JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO. DEAL WITH IT I WANT TO MISS CONNOR I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT I DIDN'T SEE THEM AS WEBER WITH TO GET RECOGNITION DO YOU MIND IF WE COME BACK HERE FOR CLOSE. THANK YOU DOCTOR ARE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER I APOLOGIZE NO PROBLEM I WILL BE VERY VERY BRIEF I THOUGHT THERE WERE OTHER FOLKS WANTING TO TALK. I'VE COME HERE OBVIOUSLY TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND THIS IS A BILL REALLY ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT AND WE HAVE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN EVEN ON THIS FLOOR. BUT WE'VE SEEN ACCIDENT OCCURRED IN THE PAST THAT ARE MADE ASSEMBLY OURS BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE TO DISCRIMINATE. AND WE'VE SEEN OURSELVES GRAPPLING WITH THOSE ISSUES THAT OVERTURNING PASSED POLICIES AND CELEBRATING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN ABUSED BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN SEXUAL ORIENTATION. WE DID THAT THIS% YEAR WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE IT IS NOW TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE ISSUE OF THIS IS NOT REALLY JUST THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE LAW. BUT REALLY THE ISSUE OF FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND NOT OUR OWN BIASES WITH REGARDS TO SEXUAL PREFERENCE AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND SO WE CAN CREATE IMAGES THAT IT'S YOU KNOW THAT EVERYTHING'S GOING A MONTH. BUT WHEN WE HAVE OUR OWN DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND OTHERS WHO ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE IN THEIR POINT OF VIEW SAYING THIS IS AN UNJUST TO PRACTICE THAT WE HAVE. AND THAT THIS LAW NEEDS TO BE CHANGED SO THAT WE CAN TREAT EVERYONE WITH FAIRNESS REGARDLESS OF THE SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WE DO THAT WE- VOTE IRELAND. ONE FORTY FIVE BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU THINK IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL LIFE THIS IS ABOUT NOT HAVING DISCRIMINATION AND WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT. SYSTEM HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IN EVERY NOW AND THEN WE HAVE TO STEP FORWARD AND MAKE IT RIGHT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BOOK ONE. THANK YOU DR ROBERT THANK YOU MISS KAMAGRA FOR INDULGENCE BACK. TO HER CLOSE. NOW ARE. THANK YOU. I WANT TO JUST THREE. THAT THERE IS. VIEWED THIS. IN THIS. SOME FOLKS MENTIONED THE TEN YEAR CAP. THE TEN YEAR CAP IS ACTUALLY CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW. AND IF FOLKS ARE CHALLENGED WITH THAT I ACTUALLY URGE. AND NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO DO A BILL THAT FOCUSES ON THAT TEN YEAR GAP BUT THAT IS NOT THIS BILL. SB ONE FORY FIVE DOES NOT CHANGE THE OFFENSES FOR SEX CRIMES WITH A MINOR. THIS BILL DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE ANY KIND OF SEXUAL CRIMINAL ACTS. IT ALLOWS PROSECUTORS TO CONTINUE PLACING OFFENDERS ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. AS WAS MENTIONED IT IS SUPPORTED AND IN FACT SPONSORED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I WANTED TO SAY THAT IF. YOU KNOW A NINETEEN YEAR OLD. HAS CONSENSUAL SEX WITH A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD AND SOMETHING GOES AWRY IN THE RELATIONSHIP. THAT NINETEEN YEAR OLD. J. CHILD. WILL BE PUT ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY IT WILL BE MANDATORY. AND WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT HOW WE SUPPORT LGBT RIGHTS. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL. HAVING TO TELL THE PARENTS OF THAT NINETEEN YEAR OLD.

BURKE WELL CLOSE THE ROLE IN TALLY THE VOTE HIGHS FORTY KNOWS THIRTEEN THE MEASURE PASSES. MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. FOURTEEN I'M GONNA TALK SLOW. MISTER FLORA HOW WE OKAY. OKAY WE'RE GOOD I REQUEST UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO SUSPEND THE RULES TO ALLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAVID CHIU TO TAKE UP AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT TODAY WITH OUR OF HIS FATHER THE PURPOSE OF CONCURRENT SENTIMENTS. WITHOUT OBJECTION THE REQUEST IS GRANTED. THE FILE AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT THE CLERK WILL READ. SO WELL. YES SENATE BILL THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAVID CHIU AND OTHERS AND I REALLY NEEDED TO COVER NINETEEN RELIEF IN THE PLAN THERE'S A CEDAR OF THICK BACK IMMEDIATELY MISTER CHAIR YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER COLLEAGUES. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO AVERT A TRULY LOOMING CRISIS. SINCE THIS PANDEMIC BEGAN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS DEPLETED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AND GONE INTO EXTREME DEBT. AND AS A RESULT THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PAY THE RENT. TOMORROW SEPTEMBER THE FIRST THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ENDS ITS TEMPORARY VERSION MORATORIUM. IF WE DON'T ACT BY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. ANY TENANT WHO'S BEEN UNABLE TO PAY ANY AND ALL ON PAID RENT WOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE TO PAY THAT RENT BACK OR BE SUBJECT TO AN ADDICTION. A WAVE OF MASSIVE EVICTIONS WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC. CATASTROPHIC FOR HOMELESSNESS AND COVERED NINETEEN SPREAD. IT WOULD TURN THIS RECESSION INTEGRATE DEPRESSION. THIS BILLS FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE IS THAT IF SOMEONE DUE TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN IS UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT. AND IMMEDIATE EVICTION IS NOT THE SOLUTION. AND EVICTION WOULD MEAN THAT A TENANT WOULD BE FORCED OUT ONTO THE STREETS. AND THE LANDLORD WOULD NEVER GET PAID. THIS BILL SAYS WE SHOULD GIVE TENANTS SOMETIME TO GET BACK UP ON THEIR FEET. SO THAT THEY CAN EVENTUALLY PAY BACK THEIR RENTS. UNDER THIS BILL. IF YOU'VE EXPERIENCED A COVERT ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AND FOLLOW THE RULES. YOU WILL NOT BE AFFECTED FOR INABILITY TO PAY THE RENT. YOU WON'T BE AFFECTED IF YOU MISSED PAYMENTS DURING THE TIME PERIOD STARTING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THROUGH TODAY. AND IF YOU PAY AT LEAST 25% OF THE RENT. OVER THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY. YOU ALSO WILL BE AFFECTED. AMONG OTHER ASPECTS OF THE BILL. THIS BILL REQUIRES TENANTS TO DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION IF YOU'RE HIRING COME. TENANTS WILL CONTINUE TO- THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE RENT TO THEIR LANDLORDS AS RENTAL DEBT IS CONVERTED TO CIVIL DEBT. AND THEY CAN BE SUED FOR IT. THIS BILL ALSO EXTENDS THE HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS. THE SMALL LANDLORDS TO PROTECT THEM FROM FOR CLOSURE. AND ENSURE MORTGAGE SERVICES WORK WITH BARS ON LOAN WATFORD MODIFICATION OPTIONS. TWO FINAL POINTS FIRST. THIS IS A TEMPORARY FIX. DURING THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS WE WILL MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC AND RECESSION AND WE WILL HAVE TO REVISIT THIS EARLY NEXT YEAR. I THINK I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MANY OF US WHO BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST STEP UP. STATES WITH SIGNIFICANT BUDGET DEFICITS CAN'T FIX IT ON OUR OWN. WE NEED THE NEXT FEDERAL MINISTRATION TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC RELIEF FOR STRUGGLING TENANTS AND LANDLORDS. MY LAST COMMENT IS AFTER WEEKS OF ROUND THE CLOCK NEGOTIATIONS WE ARRIVED AT THE COMPROMISE REFLECTED IN THIS BILL. IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT THE SIGN OF COMPROMISE IS BOTH SIDES ARE DISSATISFIED AND THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE HERE. THIS BILL ISN'T PERFECT BUT NECESSARY SOLUTION TO AN ENORMOUS CRISIS. WHILE THIS BILL WILL PREVENT OR DELAY MANY OF ACTIONS IT PAINS ME THAT IT WILL NOT STOP ALL AFFECTIONS. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE I WANTED TO SEE IN THIS BILL SO MUCH MORE THAT I FOUGHT FOR DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS SO MUCH MORE NEEDED TO TRULY PROTECT RENTERS. BUT THROUGH THE NEGOTIATIONS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE CHOICE WAS NOT. BETWEEN THIS PROPOSAL IN A STRONGER ONE THE HOBSON'S CHOICE WAS BETWEEN THIS PROPOSAL AND NOTHING. WE HAVE TO PASS THIS MEASURE TONIGHT THE CONSEQUENCES OF DOING SO ARE TOO DIRE TO COMPREHEND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR TO MR BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE OH EIGHT EIGHT NINE I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- ALL OF HIS HARD WORK IN IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT TO A TRULY HAS BEEN A- A JOURNEY I THINK FOR ALL OF US INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE AND- I RISE IN SUPPORT BOTH OF YOUR COLLEAGUE AND AS THE SPEAKERS APPOINTEE TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND I. THOUGHT THAT I WOULD PROVIDE. SOME CONTEXT THAT- YOU HAVE TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT HERE TODAY BACK IN MARCH THE GOVERNOR MADE HIS EMERGENCY ORDERS LOCKING DOWN THE STATE AS A RESULT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN OUTBREAK. AND THE GOVERNOR SPECIFICALLY DEFERRED TO THE COURTS THE ABILITY TO ENTER THEIR OWN ORDERS WITH RESPECT TO THE COURTS AS LONG AS THEY WERE CONSISTENT WITH HIS EXECUTIVE ORDERS. BECAUSE THE COURTS WERE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LOCKDOWN ORDERS OF THE REST OF THE STATE. IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE COUNCIL TO ENTER A NUMBER OF ORDERS REGARDING COURT PROCESS IN SEVERAL AREAS. AND AMONG THESE WERE EVICTIONS AND FORECLOSURES. SO WHY COULD THE COURT NOT HANDLE EVICTIONS WILL FUNCTIONAL COURTS REQUIRE. JUST LIKE WE DO CORD EMPLOY A COURT EMPLOYEES LIKE JUDGES CLERKS AND BAILIFFS WE HAVE CLERKS WE YOU KNOW PEOPLE NEED TO COME IN AND OUT OF THE BUILDING. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT ATTORNEYS AND LITIGANTS MUST BE ABLE TO BE PRESENT. WELL THE ONLY WAY FOR THE COURTS TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE GOVERNOR'S LOCKDOWN ORDERS THAT THE COURT REALLY HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO SUSPEND THEIR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES. IN ORDER TO SAFELY COMPLY. AND THIS RESULTED IN A JUDICIAL COUNCIL ORDER STAYING ALL EVICTION PROCEEDINGS. AS THE COURTS BEGAN TO RE OPEN THE RATIONALE FOR THE RULE BEGAN TO SLOWLY ERODE AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL EVENTUALLY MADE A DETERMINATION THAT EVICTION PROCESS. COULD START UP AGAIN BECAUSE THE COURTS WELL FUNCTIONING AT A FRACTION OF THEIR FORMER CAPACITY JUST LIKE WE'RE NOT QUITE AT THE CAPACITY WE'D LIKE TO BE. THE COURTS COULD THEN HANDLE OBJECTIONS OR AT LEAST BEGIN TO HANDLE THEM. THIS WAS MATT WITH UNDERSTANDABLE ALARM BY MANY ADVOCATES AND THE COURT DEFERRED ACTION HOWEVER EVENTUALLY A TERMINATING ORDER WAS MADE AND TOMORROW IS THE DATE ON WHICH THAT ORDER TAKES EFFECT. WHY TOMORROW. IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE DID YOU JUST WILL COUNCIL WISELY GAVE THE LEGISLATURE THE TIME REMAINING IN OUR SESSION EVERY MINUTE OF OUR SESSION WE NEEDED ALMOST OF ALL OF IT. TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO PROTECT LANDLORDS AND TENANTS FROM A CHAOTIC AND DAMAGING SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IF WE WERE TO DO NOTHING. FORTUNATELY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO HAD A BILL ALREADY IN PROCESS HE'S AN EXPERT ON HOUSING. AND THIS BECAME THE VEHICLE FOR A VERY INTENSE AND COMPLEX ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THE ULTIMATE RESULT IS THE BILL BEFORE US. IT'S NOT A PERFECT DEAL LANDLORDS HAVE QUALMS TENANTS ARE NOT WOWED BY IT ADVOCATES AND MEMBERS HAVE TAKEN ISSUE BUT THE FACT IS THE BILL PROVIDES BADLY NEEDED PROTECTION AND STABILITY TO POSSIBLY MILLIONS OF LANDLORDS AND TENANTS ACCORDING TO TURNER INSTITUTE. AND WILL HELP AVERT CHAOTIC EKYC A CHAOTIC ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE SO I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB THREE AWAY DAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR LOW MR STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU BETTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THIS IS A BILL WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO AND I APPRECIATE THE DILIGENCE IN THE WORK OF OUR HOUSING CHAIR WHO HAS DEDICATED THIS LAST YEAR. TO BE THAT VOICE FOR TENANTS FOR THE SMALL LANDLORDS FOR THE FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING IN THIS PANDEMIC IN UNDER THE CURRENT ECONOMIC. SITUATION BUT WHAT'S MISSING FROM THIS AND I KNOW THE LANDLORDS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS TENANTS ARE LOOKING FOR SOME RELIEF. PEOPLE ARE LOSING LIVELIHOODS AND MONEY. BUT THE FOLKS WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HELP HERE THE MOST ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYTHING UNDER THIS BILL AND I THINK WE JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT HERE. THAT ARE SMALL LANDLORDS THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT THE TENANTS WE WANT TO PROTECT IT MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT LOSING THEIR HOMES THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT'S GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM. BUT THE BANKS WHO COULD BE HELPFUL HERE AND UNDER ANY SCENARIO THE BANKS WILL STILL GET THEIR MONEY. BUT THEY COULD TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. AND COULD HAVE TAKEN SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE. TO HELP THE SITUATION OUT. RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING TO PROTECT THEIR SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS. AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR COMMUNITIES FALLING APART. AND PEOPLE FACING THE FRIGHTENING. CIRCUMSTANCE OF. FINANCIAL RUIN. SO THIS BILL IS SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO. IT'S NOT THE DEAL THAT HAD BEEN CRAFTED OVER THE YEAR. IT WAS PUT TOGETHER TO SATISFY OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE VERY CAREFUL. WHEN WE'RE PUTTING BURDENS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY BURDENED AND THOSE IN A POSITION TO HELP. GET AWAY SCOT FREE. THAT PART TO ME IS VERY DISTURBING BUT- WE HAVE TO PASS THIS BILL TODAY WE ALL HAVE TENANTS. SMALL LANDLORDS OTHERS WHO ARE JUST HOLDING ON IN OUR DISTRICTS. IF WE CAN'T PASS THIS RELIEF. THERE IS NO PLACE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO AYE AYE URGENT AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR STERN WAS WORKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. BEAR WITH ME AS I TRIED THIS. LEGISLATURA M. S. TWO SAYS LEISURE CONDEMNING WHICH MEANS IT IS THE DUTY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT JUST LAWS THAT REPRESENT AND PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS. TO DO NOTHING IS THE MORAL. TO SEE JUST RIGHT HERE ON THE GRID OF SACRAMENTO ON ALMOST EVERY CORNER SOMEBODY LINE. IN SOME TYPE OF ENTRY WAY WITH BOXES COVERING THEM WITH TRACHSEL USUALLY AROUND THEM. SOME BAREFOOT SOME HUNGRY. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS FACED A HOMELESS CRISIS WHAT CRISIS WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME WE STOOD ON THE FLOOR AND FAT FOUGHT FOR RENT CAPS WITH A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO AND THAT WAS A STEP WE STARTED THE YEAR WITH THE GOVERNOR MAKING A STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO TRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS. COURSE THE PANDEMIC YET AND IN MANY WAYS WE'VE INSTALLED. BUT IMAGINE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE PEOPLE ON OUR STREET. WE DON'T HAVE THE SHELTERS WE DON'T HAVE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND WE DON'T HAVE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR ALL THOSE THAT MAY BE EVICTED IF WE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS I CAN GUARANTEE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE FLOODED WITH PEOPLE WHO CANNOT FIND HOUSING SOME MAY FIND HOUSING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS BUT WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE FAMILIES. CHILDREN SENIORS VETERANS THAT WILL ADD TO OUR HOMELESS NUMBERS SO MEMBERS. PLEASE DIG DEEP SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING EVICTED ONCE SOMEONE IS A VICTIM IT IS MUCH HARDER FOR THEM TO FIND HOUSING. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. THREE ZERO EIGHT EIGHT. THANK YOU FOR TELLING US RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM TO OUR- MADAM SPEAKER I'M I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT THE MR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO HAS DONE AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING HOWEVER THERE IS A POPULATION THAT WAS LEFT OUT IN PARTICULAR I MET WITH THE SENIOR GROUP. AND A FEW OLDER LADIES ONE IN PARTICULAR EIGHTY YEARS OLD WHO IS- IN THE WHEELCHAIR HER HUSBAND PASSED AWAY AND LEFT HER THREE PROPERTIES HEARD TAXES ARE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND BY DEFINITION OF MOST OF THE ELDERLY HAVE PAID WELL MOST OF THE ELDERLY FOLKS HAVE PAID THEIR THEIR MORTGAGES OFF SO WE LEFT THAT POPULATION OUT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT WE LOOK FURTHER AND HOPEFULLY THE GOVERNOR CAN HELP IN THIS MATTER PROPERTY TAXES ARE DUE IN DECEMBER AND WE ARE NOT RETURNING UNTIL JANUARY SO WHAT RELIEF TO THAT THOSE FOLKS GET THOSE FOLKS ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES. SO I URGE AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH BOTH MY COLLEAGUES- THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL ABOUT GETTING RELIEF FOR THOSE FOLKS IT IS. GREAT THAT WE ARE TAKING CARE OF LANDLORDS AND TENANTS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE POPULATION THAT. CANNOT PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES SORRY URGE. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PLEASE LOOK INTO IT WE EXTENDED THE PROPERTY TAX DEADLINE. OR THEN SOME COUNTY THEY DID NOT IMPOSE PENALTIES SO IF WE CAN DO THAT AGAIN FOR THAT GROUP. PROPERTY TAXES ARE DUE IN DECEMBER WE'RE NOT COMING BACK TILL JANUARY FOR THE OF THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED- HOPEFULLY THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. WITH THAT I ALSO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BANNISTER KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I LISTEN TO THE DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE WHICH BY THE WAY WAS ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. AND I HEARD THE SAY THAT THIS IS A STOP GAP MEASURE. THIS IS A FIVE MONTH SOLUTION. I HEARD SEVERAL MEMBERS SAY THAT THIS IS A HIGHLY IMPERFECT SOLUTION BUT IT'S THE ONLY VEHICLE WE HAVE THAT IS THIS OR NOTHING. BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE WE DON'T HAVE TO LEGISLATIVE INTO AVOID. V. OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVE IS TO KEEP WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. EIGHTEEN OF US IN THIS ASSEMBLY HAVE SENT A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR ASKING FOR A SPECIAL SESSION. THIS WOULD ALLOW US. TO DEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE OF THE ADDICTION CRISIS AS CONDITIONS WARRANT. IN REAL TIME. IN A WAY WHERE THE RELIEF IS TAILORED TO THE DEMANDS OF THE MOMENT IN A WAY THAT BALANCES THE EQUITIES. THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL JUST SAID IN HIS INTRODUCTION THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO REVISIT THIS EARLY NEXT YEAR ALL THE BETTER TO REVISIT IT. IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER TO SEE HOW THIS IS WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE IN NEED. AND BY THE WAY IF DURING. THIS EXTENDED SESSION. WE DEVOTED THE FULL INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO SORTING OUT THE MESS OF THE EDT. WHICH BASICALLY EVERYONE HERE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED AND PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET THEIR BENEFITS IN A TIMELY MANNER. THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE FACING ADDICTION. IN THE FIRST PLACE. I HAVE SENT A REQUEST TO THE SPEAKER TO SIGN ON TO MY LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR. AND I ASK EVERYONE HERE. TO DO SO AS WELL. I DON'T REALLY EVEN SEE THE COUNTER ARGUMENT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU WE DON'T HAVE EVENTS IN OUR DISTRICTS TO ATTEND. THOSE HAVE ALL BEEN CANCELED AND EVEN IF WE WERE TO STAY IN SESSION A FULL TWO MORE MONTHS WE STILL WOULD END UP SPENDING LESS TIME IN THE CAPITAL THIS YEAR. THAN WE WERE SUPPOSED TO. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY HAS BEEN. A NIGHTMARE FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. AND WORK AS HARD AS WE CAN TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME MINISTER GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND BRINGING THIS BILL BEFORE US TODAY. WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN AND WHAT IT'S DONE TO OUR ECONOMY OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. SOARING UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS HAVE LEFT THOUSANDS ON THE BRINK OF EVICTION UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT OR THE MORTGAGE AS THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S EVICTION MORATORIUM DRAWS NEAR VERY NEAR. IT IS THE CENTRAL THAT WE STRIKE THE DELICATE BALANCE OF PROTECTING TENANTS WITHOUT FURTHER JEOPARDIZING THE LIVELIHOODS OF THE SMALL LANDOWNERS WHO RELY ON RENT PAYMENTS FOR THEIR OWN SURVIVAL A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT STRIKES THAT BALANCE. IT IS A PRAGMATIC REASONABLE SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS FACING OUR STATE AND FOR THESE REASONS I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON. MR SANTIAGO ARE YOU SEE RECOGNITION YEAH OKAY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR. THANK YOU A MAN SPEAK I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TODAY L. L. O. COLLEAGUES I'M STANDING UP HERE TO URGE. A YES VOTE BECAUSE WHAT'S AT STAKE IS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREET WHEN WE BEGAN THIS SESSION WE TALKED ABOUT HOMELESSNESS BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES OF OUR LIFETIME. AND IF WE DON'T MATH WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS. YOU COULD ALMOST ANY NEIGHBORHOOD. AND WE BEGIN TO SEE TENTH. WHERE PEOPLE LIVING YOUNG FAMILIES ARE NOW ARE NOW LIVING. THERE ARE CARS. WHERE PEOPLE NOW LIVE IN THESE CARS COULD YOU IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE THERE ARE NO TEN A PROTECTION AND WE CANNOT KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE TO GET ON A BUS ON THE STREET IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. THAT WE VOTE YES ON THE BILL BEFORE NOW ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AISLE SUGGESTED THAT WE CONTINUE TO STAY HERE AND WORK. NOW THAT'S A CLEVER IDEA TO CONTINUE EARNING A PER DIEM THE REALITY IS WE HAVE A VOTE BEFORE US TO CONTINUE THE HARD WORK THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL YOUR AND ENSURE THAT TENANTS CONTINUE TO STAY. HOLLISTER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IDOL. THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO. SB MON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THEIR THE TIMER. THANK YOU WHEN MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO ASKED ME TO PARTNER WITH HIM ON THIS EFFORT I KNEW IT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE AS WE HAVE HEARD THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT PROBLEM FOR OUR STATE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS. I SHARE THE MANY CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND NEED TO FIND FINANCIAL HELP FOR BOTH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. BUT WE ASK OURSELVES WHERE IS THE MONEY. HERE WE ARE IN CALIFORNIA WITH NO ADDITIONAL HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR OWN FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET GAP TO DEAL WITH THIS IS THE REALITY. EXCEPT FOR CASH ASSISTANCE THE MOST VALUABLE BENEFIT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR ALL OF THE FOLKS IS TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE TIME TO PAY OFF THEIR DEBT. MORE TIME TO BRIDGE THE GAP. TO FUTURE WERE EITHER THE VIRUS IS CONTROLLED OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP WITH FUNDING. IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE AND ROUTE TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO LANDLORDS AS THEY PROVIDE RELIEF TO TENANTS I JOIN MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND ADVOCATED FOR LEGAL PROTECTIONS RELATED TO FORBEARANCE AND FOR CLOSURES. WELL I HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE VOLUNTARY ACTIONS OF MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS I STILL BELIEVE. STRONGLY THAT WE MUST PROVIDE A LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT PROTECTS ALL BUYERS REGARDLESS OF THE- PATIENT'S OR GENEROSITY ARE THERE SPECIFIC FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. WE FOUGHT HARD FOR STRONGER PROTECTIONS FOR MORTGAGE BORROWERS AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I NOT THINK THE STAFF FROM BANKING JUDICIARY IN HOUSING OF BOTH HOUSES WHO WORK TIRELESSLY TO FIND A SOUND LEGAL APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. THIS BILL AT THIS TIME DOES NOT PROVIDE. ALL OF THIS PROTECTIONS THAT BARS NEED WHO MAY FALL INTO DELINQUENCY. IT DOES NOT PROVIDE ALL THE LEGAL PROTECTIONS THAT MAY BE NEEDED. HOWEVER AS WE RETURN TO OUR DISTRICTS. IT IS A CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO BE AWARE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH TENANTS AND LANDLORDS AND BE PREPARED TO COME BACK. AT A TIME WHERE WE CHU CAN LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OUR DISTRICT AND CAN CHANGE SOME OF THIS AND CAN INTRODUCE NEW LEGISLATION. AS WE KNOW. THIS BILL ONLY GETS US THROUGH JANUARY. BUT THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT OUR WORK CONTINUES WHETHER WE ARE HERE OR IN OUR DISTRICTS. IN CLOSING I KNOW THAT THIS IS A HARD BILL BUT WE DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF DOING NOTHING. I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT ANY OF US WANT TO SEE A WAVE OF EVICTIONS AND FORECLOSURES THAT HARM OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISLI MON SEEING HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING. ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS YOUR CRITICS. AND SAY THAT I AGREE WITH THE CRITICS. THIS PROPOSALS IN PERFECT. I WISH IT HAD MORE FOR TENANTS FOR EXAMPLE WE SHOULDN'T BE STARTING EVICTIONS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND SHOULD HAVE A REAL EVICTION MORATORIUM. FOR STRUGGLING LANDLORDS WE SHOULD HAVE REAL MANDATORY MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE. FOR BOTH. WE NEED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY GONNA BE HAVING A CONVERSATION THIS FALL AS WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT NEED TO DO ENGINE NUMBER. LET ME JUST SAY IN CLOSING IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE FENCE. THANK ABOUT HER CONSTITUENTS LAST MONTH FOUR POINT THREE MILLION RENTERS REPORTED LITTLE OR NO CONFIDENCE IN BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE NEXT RENTS. THAT'S ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN EACH OF OUR DISTRICTS. THEY ARE THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO CLOSED HIS SHOP. THE IMMIGRANT FAMILY WHO LOST WORKED AT THE RESTAURANT. THE SINGLE MOM TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS WHEN THE SCHOOL CLOSED. AND IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE FENCE. THINK ABOUT THIS MOMENT. IN A DECADE WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON THIS TIME WE WILL REMEMBER. THAT DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE HAVE THE CHOICE TO DO SOMETHING. OR DO NOTHING. PASSING AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT IS THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO. ON BEHALF OF HUNDREDS OF TENANTS PROGRESSIVE AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS LIVING ON THE EDGE OF AN EVICTION.

MISTER MONTE ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND IS A PROUD JOINT AUTHOR OF AB THREE THREE ONE THE RECENT PROTESTS AND DIALOGUE AROUND RACE HAVE PROVENTHE NEED FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIVERSITY OF OUR OMMUNITIES. TO THE LANDS OF ETHNIC STUDIES ASIAN BUT ISLANDER STUDIES WITHIN ETHNIC STUDIES HAS BEEN CRITICAL TO DISPEL THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH AND REVEALED THAT VAST AND DIVERSE SUBGROUPS EXIST WITHIN THIS UMBRELLA TERM SUCH AS PACIFIC ISLANDER AND ARAB AMERICANS TO ELIMINATE OR DEFER MIGRATION HISTORIES AND TO MAKE VISIBLE THE VARIED OBSTACLES AND BARRIERS. THAT EACH OF THE ETHNIC GROUPS INCLUDED WITHIN A P. I. STUDIES ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE BENEFITS OF ETHNIC STUDIES CAN BE MEASURED MULTIPLE STUDIES SHOW THAT WHEN STUDENTS OF COLOR LEARN MORE ABOUT RACE RACISM AND CULTURAL IDENTITY THEY RAISE THEIR GRADES AND THE GRADUATION RATES. AND I'M MORE LIKELY TO ATTEND COLLEGE- EXACTLY AFTER AYE VOTE IS THE PRIORITY BILL FOR THE PACK ON. THANK YOU MR BONTA. MR GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY TO OFFER CONGRATULATIONS AND TO SPEAK TO CERTAIN AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ADDED TO AB THREE THREE ONE AT THE REQUEST OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. GIVEN THAT THIS IS A BILL OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE WE FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD AND FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE WATCHING AT HOME. THE ORIGIN AND PURPOSE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS. WHEN THIS BILL WAS FIRST INTRODUCED THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES IN CALIFORNIA WAS NOT A CONTROVERSIAL ONE IN THE JEWISH CAUCUS OR IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. INDEED THIS BILL ENJOYED THE SUPPORT OF EVERY MEMBER OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS WHEN IT FIRST PASSED THIS HOUSE. IT WAS OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY MAJOR JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ADL. AND ARE CALLING FROM SANTA MONICA WHO WE LOVINGLY REFER TO AS THE DEAN OF THE JEWISH CAUCUSIS A JOINT AUTHORS. INDEED IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE INITIAL DRAFT MODEL CURRICULUM WAS RELEASED BY CD THAT OUR COMMUNITY STARTED TO PAY ATTENTION. TO PUT IT LIGHTLY THAT DRAW DRAFT CAUGHT OUR COMMUNITY OFF GUARD. AND OUR CAUCUS RAISED OBJECTIONS TO CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE DRAFT WHICH INCLUDED CONTENT ABOUT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AND ABOUT ISRAEL THAT WAS INACCURATE BIASED AND VERY OFFENSIVE. PERSONALLY PROFESSIONALLY WAS A DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND FOR ME. WHICH STRUGGLE TO RECONCILE HOW AND WHY A TIME OF RISING ANTI SEMITISM WITH **** MARCHING IN CHARLOTTESVILLE AND ATTACKING JEWS AND HOW WAY. ANYONE WOULD WANT TO TEACH A CURRICULUM THAT INCLUDES STEREOTYPES ABOUT JEWISH CONTROL AND MANIPULATION OF THE MEDIA THAT LITERALLY ACCO **** PROPAGANDA. SINCE THAT TIME OUR CAUCUS WHO STRUGGLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT IN ETHNIC STUDIES KNOWING IT'S A CENTRAL VALLEY AND INHERENT VALUE IN A DIVERSE STATE. AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO OUR SISTER CAUCUSES AND MANY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHILE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AREN'T TEACHING THE PROBLEMATIC PORTIONS OF THE MODEL CURRICULUM. OUR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN HEIGHTENED BY THE EFFORTS OF A SMALL GROUP OF FOLKS HAVE GONE AROUND TO LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS TRYING TO RALLY SUPPORT FOR THE ORIGINAL CURRICULUM. FOR WORKING TO REINSERT BIGOTRY AND DISCRIMINATION BACK INTO THE TEACHING OF ETHNIC STUDIES. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH EDUCATIONAL EXPERTS WE CONCLUDED THAT THE BEST APPROACH WOULD BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE INSERT SOME GUARDRAILS. SO THAT ETHNIC STUDIES CANNOT BE MISSED USE IS A VEHICLE TO ATTACK OR DEFAME JEWS OR ISRAEL OR ANY OTHER COMMUNITY OR NATION. IN SO DOING WE LOOK TO THE GUARDRAILS THAT ARE EXIST IN THE EDUCATION CODE AROUND SEX EDUCATION TO MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH UNBIASED. AND MEDICALLY ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT SEX AND ABOUT SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS. AND WE TOOK THOSE EXISTING GUARDRAILS AND MODIFIED THEM SLIGHTLY TO APPLY TO THE SITUATION. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE AND DEEP APPRECIATION TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE WHO AGREED TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED GUARDRAILS. AND WHO AND WHO AFTER WE EXPLAINED THE PURPOSE HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BILL AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. FOR PURPOSES OF CLARITY I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE RELEVANT AMENDMENTS WHICH MANDATE THAT ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM CALIFORNIA MUST BE APPROPRIATE FOR USE WITH PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS. NOT REFLECT OR PROMOTE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ANY BIAS BIGOTRY OR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ANY PERSON OR GROUP OF PERSONS. ON THE BASIS OF ANY PROTECTED CATEGORY SUCH AS RACE RELIGION NATIONAL ORIGIN OR IMMIGRATION STATUS. AND NOT TEACH OR PROMOTE RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE. TO BE CLEAR THIS LANGUAGE MAKES IT UNLAWFUL FOR ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT CALIFORNIA TO USE THE ANTI SEMITIC OR ANTI ISRAEL SECTIONS OF THE ORIGINAL DRAFT CURRICULUM. OR TO OTHERWISE TEACHER PROMOTE ANTI SEMITIC STEREOTYPES BDS OR ANY OTHER CURRICULUM. THAT PROMOTES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ANY BIAS BIGOTRY OR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST JEWS. ISRAEL THE ISRAELI AMERICAN COMMUNITY OR THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. THIS LANGUAGE ALSO PROVIDES HELPFUL DIRECTION TO CD WHICH IS CONTINUE TO REVISE THE MODEL CURRICULUM. SO THEY CAN EASILY SAY NO TO THOSE ARE ADVOCATING TO REINSERT ANTI JEWISH AND ANTI ISRAELI MATERIAL BACK INTO THE CURRICULUM. SINCE THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOW CLEARLY WEIGHED IN ON THIS ISSUE. WELL THAT DISCRIMINATE CONTENT IS LIKELY ALREADY IMPERMISSIBLE UNDER THE EDUCATION CODE. THESE AMENDMENTS MAKE IT AIRTIGHT AND UNAMBIGUOUS. ONE FINAL THOUGHT. THESE GUARDRAILS ARE IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR OUR COMMUNITY BUT FOR COULD ARENTS AND STUDENTS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS WHO CAN FEEL CONFIDENT THAT NO CHILD A GROUP OF STUDENTS WILL BE SUBJECT TO BIGOTRY OR DISCRIMINATION IN THE CLASSROOM. REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE RELIGION NATIONAL ORIGIN OR IMMIGRATION STATUS. FINALLY I WANT TO CONGRATULATE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE. FOR WITH. BY RECOGNIZING THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO MOVE THIS BILL TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THIS IS A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT. A LEGACY RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A HUGE WIN FOR OUR SISTER CAUCUSES.

B. EIGHT TWO THREE IS THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSAL TO REFORM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE. JUSTICE FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE NOT DONE THE SERVICE TO ALL THE YOUTH. IN FORTUNATELY HAVE INCARCERATED IN OUR STATE. AND THIS IS ABOUT TIME TO SAY THAT WE AS A STATE ARE LONG OVERDUE FOR SOME MAJOR REFORM. LAST YEAR WE TOOK ACTION TO MOVE DJJ INTO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND UPON REFLECTION. THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR REFORM HIS PROPOSAL TO. MOVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND ASKED THE COUNTIES TO- HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF THE JUVENILES TO THE KILLERS. CURRENTLY WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED USED IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW AND NOTHING WILL BE HAPPENING TO ANY OF THOSE YOU. THIS PROPOSAL IS HOW WE WILL MOVE FORWARD IN THE FUTURE AS MORE YOUTH BECOME INCARCERATED AND WHERE THEY WILL BE. WHAT WE REALIZE IS IT'S REALLY MUCH BETTER FOR THE COUNTIES TO BE WORKING WITH THESE POPULATIONS. THEY CAN PARTNER WITH THE STATE. WE HAVE DECIDED TO PAY THE COUNTIES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER USE. THE ME JUST REITERATE THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOU. SO WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO IMPROVE THE TREATMENT FOR THE YOUTH. AND ON TOP OF THAT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS BETTER WE DECIDED WE'VE WE'VE CREATED AN OFFICE OF YOUTH JUSTICE AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. TO PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OVER THE JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS. AGAIN MEMBERS THIS IS A PROPOSAL FOR REFORMING A LONG. A LONG DO SYSTEM WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE FOR SB EIGHT TWO THREE. FAMOUS CHIANG MR OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE THIS TRAILER BILL WILL STARTING NEXT YEAR DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE TO HOLD INTAKE AND SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HOUSING OF THOSE USED TO THE COUNTIES IN WHICH THEY WERE CONVICTED. COLLEGE THIS IS A SUDDEN HAD MASSIVE CHANGE TO THE WAY THAT YOU JUSTICE IS HANDLED IN CALIFORNIA MOREOVER IT'S BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE LAST WEEK OF SESSION WITH VERY LITTLE TIME FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS TO WEIGH IN ON WHAT IS AN INCREDIBLY LARGE CHANGE IN THE WAY THIS ISSUE IS HANDLED IN CALIFORNIA. THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE LET US KNOW THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE CONCERNS. THE ABILITY OF COUNTIES TO REPLACE WHAT DJJ DOES FOR OUR YOUTH RIGHT NOW. LARGE COUNTIES MAY BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT THERE ARE MANY SMALL COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THE JUST ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO OFFER. THE QUALITY OF PROGRAMS A DJJ OFFERS DJJ OFFERS CURRENTLY PROGRAMS THAT SPECIALIZE IN TREATMENT OF THINGS LIKE A GANG AFFILIATION SUBSTANCE ABUSE. SEXUAL PREDATOR. THOSE ARE PROGRAMS THAT THE SMALL COUNTIES ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE MEANS OF THE FUNDING TO DEAL WITH. IRONICALLY THE STATED PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM AMONGST CALIFORNIA'S YOUTH BUT THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE TELLING US THAT WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT I REGION OVER. RAMOS OVER NOLTE MR COOPER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'LL BE REAL QUICK- DJJ RIGHT NOW IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SEX OFFENDER PROGRAM APPS WON AWARDS. TO HELP FIX KIDS. SONORA TAKEN OUT OF DJJ IT'S IN THE COUNTIES FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. THE DAY HAS COMMISSION PSYCHOLOGIST THAT BUILT THE STUFF THEY'RE GOING TO GET THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE IN SMALLER COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS. SO HERE WE ARE FAILING OUR KIDS ARE NOT GONNA GET REHABILITATED. THIS IS A FAILURE FOR AB ONE ONLINE THIS IS NOW THE JUVENILE VERSION OF THAT. THAT'S REALLY BEEN A BIG ISSUE DJ'S BEEN THROUGH HELL AND BACK. FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT'S WHY CHANGE THE BALL THESE PROGRAMS ON BOARD. SO ARE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS. THANKS COOPER SAY NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. CORPORAL. DESERVE IT ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. THE CLERK WILL.

AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE. CORPORATE ASSEMBLY GO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET ACCOLADE ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS. MISTER CHANG EMAIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE IT'S PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN KEEP THEIR HOMES DURING THIS VERY CHALLENGING TIME OF COVERT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE MAKES THE HOMESTEAD EEMPTION GREATER THE GREATER OF THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE COUNTY WIDE MEDIAN SALES PRICE OF A SINGLE FAMILY HOME NOT TO EXCEED SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MAYBE A TEENY FIVE ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONS TO ADJUST ITS VALUE ANNUALLY FOR INFLATION. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE ON THE BTD. FIVE THANK YOU MR CHANG MR OBERNOLTE ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THIS BILL RAISES THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY THAT A DEBTOR CAN PROTECT IN THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE FROM CREDITORS. THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD POLICY I REALLY CAN'T TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE- THIS BILL WAS FIRST PUT IN PRINT. ON FRIDAY EVENING THERE'S A REASON WHY WE'RE HEARING IT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME AT TEN THIRTY PM THE DAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADJOURN AT MIDNIGHT COLLEAGUES WE'VE BEEN DEBATING CORONAVIRUS RELIEF LEGISLATION FOR SIX MONTHS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS BILL IS EVER SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY WAS HEARD IN COMMITTEE FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF A HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION COULD BE I CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULDBE REYES I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT SHOULD BE REYES BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT HAD THE TRANSPARENCY TO ALLOW THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS PROCESS TO WEIGH IN AND TELL US WHAT THEY THINK. AND EDUCATE US ABOUT THE WEATHER NOT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT. THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY THAT WE'RE SHOWING PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HERE SHOULD BE TRULY ALARMING TO EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER. BUT THERE IS A FURTHER LEGAL PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL THIS BILL IS LABELED AS A BUDGET BILL THE REASON IT IS SO LABELED IS SO THAT IT CAN TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THIS BODY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BUDGET. NORMALLY BUDGET TRAILER BILLS ARE MANY PAGES LONG THEY CONTAIN MANY APPROPRIATIONS THIS BILL IS TWO SENTENCES AND CONTAINS ZERO APPROPRIATIONS. I FEEL THAT THIS IS ALMOST CERTAINLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND WILL BE CHALLENGED. IN THE PAST WHEN BUDGET ARE LABELING A BUDGET TRAILER BILLS HAS BEEN CHALLENGED. OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S BEEN RELATED TO THE BUDGET. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO POINT AT LEAST A TOKEN APPROPRIATION IN THAT BUDGET BILL. AS PROOF THAT IT WAS INDEED RELATED TO THE BUDGET AND THE COURTS HAVE RULED IN OUR FAVOR THEY'VE SAID AT LEAST IF THERE'S AN APPROPRIATION. THAT MAYBE THE LABEL OF A BUDGET TRAILER BILL IS APPROPRIATE BUT THERE IS NO APPROPRIATION IN THIS BILL. THE AFFECTED PARTIES ARE GOING TO TAKE US TO COURT AND WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT FORSURE WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS APPROPRIATE LABEL BUT I'M ALMOST POSITIVE IT'S GOING TO BE FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SO COLLEAGUES THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD POLICY BUT I URGE YOU TO ABSTAIN ON THIS BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOOD PROCESS IT IS NOT TRANSPARENT. AND IT'S NOTACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED US.

THANK YOU MEMBERS JUST WANNA TELL EVERYONE THAT THIS IS A BIG WIN FOR WOMEN AND FOR MEN IN CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVE A- THANK YOU. MISTER KILEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THE BILLS THAT I TEND TO BE MOST VOCALLY AGAINST HERE ARE THOSE WHERE THERE'S NO REAL LEGITIMATE POLICY ARGUMENT EVEN IN THEIR FAVORS JUST INTEREST GROUP POLITICS THROUGH AND THROUGH BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS. WITHOUT QUESTION FAMILY LEAVE IS A SOCIAL GOOD THAT IS SO VITAL TO THE HEALTH OF FAMILIES AND TO MORALE IN THE WORKPLACE. IT'S AVAILABILITY IS THE MARK OF A MATURE ECONOMY AND A HUMANE SOCIETY AND ITS EXPANSION CONSTITUTES GENUINE PROGRESS. THE DIFFICULTY LIES IN HOW THE GOAL IS PURSUED WHEN IT'S REQUIRED VERSES WHEN IT'S DRAWN HOW BURDENS GET DISTRIBUTED. IN THIS BILLGOES ABOUT THE GOAL IN ALL OF THE WRONG WAYS. AND THAT'S WHY I'M OPPOSED TO IT TODAY IN FACT I HAVE TO MAIN OBJECTION THE FIRST IS THAT AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN THIS BUILDING. A GENUINE SOCIAL GOOD GETS TRANSFORMED INTO A FEEDING GROUND FOR INTEREST GROUPS AND SO THE DEAD GIVEAWAY HERE IS THE INCLUSION OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WHICH WON'T DO MUCH TO SECURE FAMILY FOR ANYONE WILL DO A LOT TO ENRICH A CERTAIN SUBSET. OF THE STATE BAR. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LINGER ON THAT POINT. THE POINT I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE. IS THAT THIS BILL WILL SOUND A DEATH KNELL. FOR EVEN MORE SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I HAVE HERE PAGES OF TESTIMONIALS FROM SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WHO ARE ATTESTING TO THAT. AND I'LL GIVE YOU JUST A SELECTION. ROSARIO WHO OWNS A TALK URREA SAYS DON'T LEGISLATORS UNDERSTAND WHAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW WE ARE BARELY KEEPING AFLOAT. JOHN WHO DOES PRIVATE MUSIC INSTRUCTION SAYS OUR SCHOOL HAS LOST 45% OF ITS BUSINESS AND REVENUE. WE ARE HOLDING ON BY SHREDS SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WOULD SHUT US DOWN. KEVIN WHO RUNS A SMALL INDEPENDENT URGENT CARE SAYS I UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL IS SUPPOSED TO DO MY LARGER COMPANIES CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS. BUT IN THE TINY BUSINESS LIKE OURS THIS BILL WOULD LITERALLY DRIVE US TO BANKRUPTCY. JIMINEZ WHO ON A CANDY STORE SAY IT'S HARD ENOUGH IT'S HARD ENOUGH AS IT IS TRYING TO KEEP THE BUSINESS AFLOAT WITH ALL THE CODE RESTRICTIONS. I HAVE FOURTEEN EMPLOYEES SO IT SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE DEFINITELY WOULD IMPACT US. AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. PHILIP WHO OWNS A BAKERY SAYS PROVIDING TWELVE WEEKS OF LEAVE. WOULD CRIPPLE US OF MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES TOOK THIS AT ONCE. MIKE WHO DOES PARTY RENTAL SAID IF THE MINIMUM WAGE DOESN'T PUT US OUT OF BUSINESS AND SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WELL. BOUNCE AROUND THE NAIL SALON SAYS TWELVE LEAST WEEKS OFF WOULD DEFINITELY PUT A DEATH SENTENCE. THE SMALL BUSINESS. JOHN WHO I THE MANAGEMENT GROUP SAYS PLEASE VOTE NO ON SB THIRTY THREE. IT'S JUST TOO MUCH FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES. JOEY WHO'S IN PERSONAL KERR SAYS BY PASSING THIS BILL SB THIRTY THREE. WOULD BE THE FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR ME IN MY BUSINESS THAT I STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO. THE NEEDS TO DOES BALLOON DELIVERIES SAYS DON'T MAKE OUR LIVES MORE DIFFICULT WITH LAWS THAT HURT THE ECONOMY. AND THE EMPLOYEES WHO END UP WITH NO JOBS. RICK DOES FOR COVERING SAYS WE ARE SIMPLY IN NO POSITION TO TAKE ON ANY FURTHER BURDEN. WE ARE ALL AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC I HAVE WORKED AT THIS LOCATION FOR FORTY SEVEN YEARS IT HAS BEEN MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS FOR NEARLY SIXTY YEARS THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN CONTINUOUS OPERATION FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS. TODAY WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF A PERMANENT SHUT DOWN. JASON WHO'S IN MANUFACTURING SAYS I OWN A SEVENTY YEAR OLD MANUFACTURING COMPANY WITH FORTY FIVE EMPLOYEES AND I'VE WORKED HARD TO KEEP JOBS IN THE US AND COMPETE ON THE GLOBAL STAGE BUT I'M NOT ABLE TO RAISE PRICES FAST ENOUGH. TO KEEP UP WITH BILLS LIKE THIS. JOSEPH WHO RUN THE CONCRETE CONFERENCE CENTER SAYS IF ANY OF MY EMPLOYEES WERE PERMITTED TO TAKE A TWELVE WEEK LEAVE US PROPOSED BY SB THIRTY THREE. OUR BUSINESS TO BE TOTALLY SHUT DOWN AND WE WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS. SHANNON WITH THE YMCA SAYS ALTHOUGH WE ARE COMPLETELY WILLING TO SUPPORT OUR STAFF THE ABILITY TO DO SO IS NOT FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME. MARK IN WAREHOUSING SAYS SERVICE WILL SUFFER CUSTOMERS WILL LEAVE AND BUSINESSES WILL CLOSE. MARK WHO'S IN PHOTOGRAPHY SAYS DURING NORMAL TIMES A FOURTEEN WEEK LEAVE WOULD BE AN UNDUE BURDEN NOW THIS MAY BE THE FINAL NAIL IN OUR COFFIN NOTICED THAT PHRASE AGAIN. THE FINAL NAIL IN OUR COFFIN. JUDY WHO RUNS IN A- CORE AS I ALREADY LOST MORE THAN HALF OF MY MONTHLY INCOME DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. I HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING MYSELF BUT THIS WON'T LAST TOO LONG AND SB THIRTY THREE BECOMES LAW. AND I MUST BE MANDATORY TWELVE WEEKS WE FOR EACH EMPLOYEE I WILL HAVE TO SHUT THE DOOR. AND GO OUT OF BUSINESS THIRTY SECONDS. I HAVE MANY MORE PAGES OF THESE. THAT I HAVE MINUTES TO SPEAK. THESE ARE VOICES CRYING OUT FOR MY COMMUNITY CRYING OUT FROM YOUR COMMUNITIES. PLEADING NOT THIS NOT NOW I JOIN THOSE VOICES IN ASKING YOU TO PLEASE VOTE NO. I SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE I'M GONNA BE HONEST THIS IS A SIMPLE QUESTION DO YOU THINK A WOMAN WHO JUST HAD A BABY WHO WORKS FOR AN EMPLOYER WITH NINETEEN PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND TIME WITH THAT CHILD AND NOT RISK LOSING HER JOB. WITH NOT A CENT PAID BY THAT EMPLOYER NOT A CENT SHE HAS ALREADY PAID INTO THE SYSTEM IT IS HER MONEY SHE'S GETTING BACK THE QUESTION IS DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO STAY HOME WITH HER CHILD AND NOT LOSE HER JOB THAT'S WHAT THIS VOTE IS ABOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT.

ON AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE GREAT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHO REPRESENTS ANOTHER AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT YOU KNOW THIS ALSO IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE OUR FAMILY FARMERS DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO GO BUY ANOTHER FOUR WHEELER OR ANOTHER GATOR OR ANOTHER. OFF ROAD VEHICLE.

ELEVEN TWENTY. SB ELEVEN TWENTY CLERK WILL READ SENATE ELEVEN TWENTY BY CENTER ATKINS ANOTHER'S MEDICALLY THE LAND USE MR RIVAS HE MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER PROUD RESENT US SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY BEHALF OF THE SENATE PRO TEM ATKINS AS WE ALL KNOW THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET THERE IS NO EASY SOLUTION TO SOLVE OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. WE NEED TO BE HAVING THIS PROBLEM FROM MULTIPLE ANGLES AND CLEARLY WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE. WE NEED TO STAY FOCUSED ON OUR GOAL HELPING THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CANNOT AFFORD DECENT HOUSING. EVERY DAY MORE AND MORE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE ARE PUSHED INTO HOMELESSNESS. AS WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO DRASTICALLY INCREASE OUR SUPPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS PROBLEM WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO GET WORSE IF WE DO NOT. SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY. ALLOWS PROPERTY OWNERS TO BUILD DUPLEXES GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBDIVIDE THEIR LAND TO CREATE MORE HOUSING. TO CREATE MORE HOUSING SO LONG AS THESE NEW UNITS MEET EXISTING COMMUNITY STANDARDS. SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY BUILT ON OUR SUCCESSFUL APPROACH TO ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. WHICH HAS LED TO THE PERMITTING OF THOUSANDS OF NATURALLY AFFORDABLE UNITS STATEWIDE. TURNER CENTER AT BERKELEY I WAS RECENTLY FOUND THAT IF JUST 5% OF ELIGIBLE PARCELLS CREATED A DUPLEX. IT WOULD RESULT IN. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW HOMES THAT'S ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE STATE'S HOUSING CONSTRUCTION GOAL OVER THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS. ALL WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE UNITS ARE SO ARE SMALL SCALE UNITS ARE EASY TO BUILD. UNITS THAT WOULD ALSO HELP CREATE EQUITY FOR HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO HELP US SOLVE THIS HOUSING CRISIS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MYSTERY THIS MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY. SB ELEVEN TWENTY IS TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL. FROM OUR CITIES TO BE ABLE TO. PRESERVE AND PROTECT SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. I ASKED FOR A NO VOTE. THERE IS DIVERSITY MISS FRIEDMAN YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I KNOW IT'S LATE AND EVERYBODY WANTS US TO GET THROUGH THIS BUT I FEEL THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR ME NOT TO SPEAK ON. OUR THE REASON THAT THIS BILL HAS BEEN VERY TOUGH FOR ME IS BECAUSE I HAVE VOTED FOR I THINK ALL OF THE HOUSING BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN FRONT OF THIS HOUSE PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEM AND VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE GOALS OF WHAT THIS BILLS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST THIS BILL ARE INACCURATE AND SOME CASES EVEN INSULTING HOWEVER. I WILL SAY VERY QUICKLY THAT I HAVE SOME MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL HAVING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT I'VE ANALYZE THIS BILLAND I'VE GONE THROUGH IT AND AS A LOT OF QUESTIONS THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW MORE DEVELOPMENT IN OUR WILD FIRE AREAS. AND IN AREAS THAT RIGHT NOW WE ALLOW SINGLE FAMILY HOUSES BUT AN INFILL AREAS ARE MOSTLY BUILT OUT WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE DEVELOPMENT IN A LOT OF AREAS IN LOS ANGELES THROUGHOUT THE HILLS IN LOS ANGELES WHERE WE HAVE VERY AN ADEQUATE INGRESS AND EGRESS NO I'M NOT UP HERE TO CHANGE ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THIS. BUT I RESPECT THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL ENOUGH TO GIVE THE REASONS WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY MY- BIGGEST CONCERN HOWEVER HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WHILE I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL CERTAINLY OPEN UP A LOT OF NEEDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENTERS AND I BELIEVE THAT TRULY THAT THIS IS NEEDED TO HAVE MORE HOUSING. IN A LOT OF OUR SINGLE FAMILY AREAS I AM VERY NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUY A HOME FOR THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOW HAVING TO. BID AGAINST SPECULATIVE DEVELOPERS. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF. OF A PROFIT THAT COULD BE CREATED BY WHAT THIS BILL ALLOWS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS. SUCH A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM WHAT WE HAVE THAT WE SHOULD PILOT THIS BEFORE WE DO IT STATEWIDE. I THINK THAT'S PRUDENT. I'M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN AREAS IN OUR WE AREAS SUCH AS- THEIR HOME GROUND PROJECT. YOU HAVE SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS ALREADY ENTITLED LOTS ALREADY SUBDIVIDED. IN WHAT IS OUR WILDLIFE INTERFACE AREA. I'VE GONE THROUGH THIS AND ASK QUESTIONS AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT PROJECT IN TURN FROM SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS. ID TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND UNITS RIGHT NOW BY RIGHT WITHOUT REVIEW BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. WE ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO IN AREAS THAT ARE NEAR JOBS IN YOUR TRANSPORTATION. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S CONSIDERED AN URBAN AREA ON THE MAP. IT'S ALMOST ALL OF L. A. COUNTY. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S NEAR JOBS NEAR AMENITIES OR WHETHER IT'S IN A WILD PRICE INTERFACE AREA. I'M NERVOUS ABOUT SPRAWL I'M NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT THIS DOES. TO PEOPLE TRYING TO GET INTO THE MARKET AND FOR THAT I RESPECTFULLY HAVE TO. TO NOT BE ABLE TO. DAY THANK YOU. THANKS FRIEDMAN MISS WICKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH COLLEAGUES IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF FEEDING MY DAUGHTER WAS BILL CAME UP AND I RAN DOWN ON THE FLOOR TODAY BECAUSE I STRONGLY BELIEVE WE NEED TO PASS THIS BILL. WE ARE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME SHOVEL READY TO BE RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE. AND ONLY AGREES THAT WE NEED IT WE NEED WE ACTUALLY NEED TO PASS THIS BILL AND I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF YOU THESE WERE. SOME OF YOU. BUT IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND I JUST COME DOWN HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- TO MY COLLEAGUES. IT'S THE SIMPLEST WAY WE CAN HAVE. DENSITY BUT STILL HERE SAID. CHARACTER SO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. FILL AND I MEAN TO GO FINISH READING MY DAUGHTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MAKES. MISS KAY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE- IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I COULD GO ON BUT I'M NOT BECAUSE THE HOUR IS LATE BUT- THE THINK CLEAR ACTUALLY COMPROMISES THE CHARACTER. AND IT'S CERTAINLY. LIMITS LOCAL CONTROL I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING YES SUPPLY IS IMPORTANT YES DENSITY WORKS IN MANY AREAS. BUT WE CONTINUED TO PUT FORWARD THESE BILLS AND WE SAY THAT WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE'RE LIVING IN A STATE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN DUPED INTO THINKING. THAT AFFORDABLE IS PAYING TWELVE DOLLARS FOR A CUP OF COFFEE AND A DOUGHNUT. THAT IS NOT AFFORDABLE THE STATE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNAFFORDABLE. AND SO RATHER THAN. CREATED CREATING A DYNAMIC WHERE YOU SET UP. ACTUALLY AN INVASION INTO SMALL COMMUNITIES BY DEVELOPERS AND SPECULATORS WE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE HAVING SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO DEVELOP NON MARKET PRICE GUARANTEED HOUSING BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF UNITS THAT ARE TEACHERS OUR STUDENTS ARE GROCERY WORKERS ARE CASHIERS ARE WORKING CLASS FAMILIES. AND CALIFORNIANS DESERVE NOT. THIS BILL WITH QUITE FRANKLY THE KIND OF THE FOLKS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE LAND AND CREATE THESE DUPLEXES AND QUAD. ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT GOING TO BE MULTI NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS. CHANGING. THE CHARACTER OF OUR COMMUNITY. THIS ISN'T SAYING LET'S HAVE ALL BUILDERS LET PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM THE COMMUNITY. ACTUALLY BUILDING LET'S PEOPLE WHO READ THEM UNDER THE FABRIC IN THE LANDSCAPE OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE FIFTY FOURTH LET THEM PARTICIPATE IN THIS. I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT ONE HUNDRED A HUNDRED PLUS YEARS AGO. WITH ANGELA JOHNSON FORTY ACRES AND A MULE AND BLACK FOLKS HAVEN'T SOME LAND AND THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE IT IN FOR CENTURIES FOR YEARS FOR GENERATIONS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE LAND BACK. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE DEVELOPERS CALLING YOUR PHONE EVERY DAY ASKING IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO SELL YOUR PROPERTY. AND THEN HAVING APPRAISERS COME IN AND UNDER VALUE YOUR PROPERTY SO THAT FOLKS CAN GET IT AT THE CHEAP. AND HOW THAT ALSO ACCELERATES AND EXACERBATES GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT. BUT INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THAT I'M GOING TO JUST TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT. WHY DON'T WE LOOK AT LEAST RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES LIKE BE INVENTORY OF LAND THAT THE STATE. THE INVENTORY OF LAND THAT OUR LOCALITIES AND OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE COULD BE USING THAT INVENTORY TO BUILD WE COULD BE LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE TRANSFORMING. YES LIGHT COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR. BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE ASKING FOR A INVASION BY DEVELOPERS INTO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE WE'RE TO LAZY QUITE FRANKLY TO HAVE MORE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE'RE PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND FINDING WAYS TO BUILD HOUSING THAT PEOPLE TRULY CAN AFFORD SO WITH THAT I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON SB ELEVEN TWENTY. MISTER MATHIS. ALRIGHT MISTER SPEAKER THE MR MAYS WAS AHEAD OF ME IN LINE YES MIKE UP FOR. MEMBERS THERE'S A LOT OF POINTS ON THIS BILL THAT I CAN AGREE WITH I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED MORE WE NEEDED TO BE AFFORDABLE. WELL I THINK A LOT OF US AGREE THAT FAMILIES ARE HAVING A HARD TIME. BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T QUITE GET THERE. I THINK THERE'S CONSIDERATIONS- ESPECIALLY IN OUR VALLEY AREA WHEN WE LOOK AT. QUESTIONS OF WATER ACCESSIBILITY. WE HAVE REGULATIONS LIKE SIGNAL THAT ARE COMING INTO AFFECTS. AND EVERY YEAR WE GET CUT OFF MORE MORE SURFACE WATER. AND WE KNOW THAT HOUSING PROJECTS ACTUALLY CHIU OF MORE WATER THAN HOUSING PRODUCT. WHEN WE GET INTO THE CONVERSATIONS OF URBAN SPRAWL. AND WE TALK ABOUT PAULINE AGRICULTURAL LAND OFF. AND HAVING HOUSING PROJECTS TO GO UP. IN FOR ALL OF THOSE OF YOU WHO LOVE TO TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO CONSIDER THIS. AGRICULTURAL LAND. THAT THESE NEW HOUSING PROJECTS WITH POSSIBLY CHIU OF. IT'S TEN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES COOLER THAN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. SO CONSIDER THAT ONE. NOW THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES ON THIS. A AND I REALLY LIKE THE POINT THE THAT WAS MADE BECAUSE IN MY COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VERY POOR. AND DISENFRANCHISED. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE INVESTORS COME IN. AND OFFER THEM. MONEY AND DO THINGS TO CHASE THEM OUT. SO THEY CAN SPLIT UP THESE HOMES. THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. NOW IS THE HUSBAND OF A REALTOR I'M PROBABLY GONNA HERE WHEN I GET HOME FOR NOT BEING THERE ON THIS ONE BECAUSE THEN IT'S LESS UNITS FOR MY WIFE TO BE ABLE TO SELL BOY. YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS. WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET THESE THINGS RIGHT MEMBERS. NO I SAY WE EVERY YEAR. YOU KNOW. FAST A SLOW SLOW IS SMOOTH SMOOTH IS FAST. AND. YOU ALL TRY TO SPEED THROUGH THESE THINGS AND THROWN TOGETHER IN YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST MORE SPAGHETTI THROWN AT THE WALL WE KNOW IT'S NOT DONE COOKIN AND WE'RE SLOWLY WATCHING. THIS BILL AND OTHER BILLS JUST. QUITE NOT STICK. SULM I URGE YOU MEMBERS LET'S GET THIS ONE RIGHT LET'S GET IT RIGHT FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD LET'S GET IT RIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA LET'S GET IT RIGHT SO WHEN OUR CHILDREN HIT THAT POINT. WHERE THEY GO TO BUY A HOME. THEY CAN ACTUALLY BY THAT NICE SINGLE FAMILY UNIT AND HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD TO RAISE OUR GRANDKIDS AND THANK YOU. THERE WAS TRAVIS MISS CUNNINGHAM YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. LOOK WE HAVE A MASSIVE MASSIVE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM TODAY SITTING HERE KNOWS WE HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE. SO WE ARE EITHER SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING THAT PROBLEM OR WE ARE NOT. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING THAT THEN WE WILL MAKE GOOD USE OF EXISTING RESOURCES WILL LET PEOPLE DIVIDE LOTS. WE'LL LET PEOPLE BUILD EIGHTY USE TO MOVE THEIR GRANDPARENT IN NEXT DOOR TO THEM. THOSE ARE COMMON SENSE THINGS WE CAN DO. TO MAKE EXISTING USE OF RESOURCES AND WE SHOULD DO THAT AND YOU KNOW WHY WE SHOULD DO THAT BECAUSE ALL OF OUR KIDS WOULD LOVE TO STAY IN THIS WONDERFUL STATE. ALL OF OUR CHILDREN WOULD LOVE TO SUNDAY WITH THEIR THEIR PARENT AND LIVED OTHER GRANDPARENT BUT WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA IF WE CONTINUE ON THE PRESENT PRESENT PATH THAT IS GOING TO BE UNAFFORDABLE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION TOTALLY UNAFFORDABLE WE ALL KNOW IT. SO IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT DOING SUB FOR THAT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. VOTE FOR THIS BILL. GIVES PROPERTY OWNERS MORE FREEDOM OVER THEIR OWN LAND. LET THEM SUBDIVIDE LET THEM BUILD EIGHTY YEARS. LET THEM DO THINGS THAT SOME THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL LOCK NOT ALLOWED THEM TO DO THAT WILL INCREASE SUPPLY. THAT WILL INCREASE HOUSING IN OUR STATE. AGAIN IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING THE HOUSING PROBLEM. WE HAVE TO DO. WHAT IT TAKES AND THAT IS INCREASE SUPPLY THIS BILL WILL DO IT I URGE AND I BOTH. THANK YOU MISS CUNNINGHAM MISTER MAYES YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS- I RISE TONIGHT TO BE. JUST TO SAY THAT I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS. MISTER MAYES PLEASE PROCEED I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED- IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE WE BEHAVE TO THIS YEAR I REALIZE IT'S BEEN A PANDEMIC BUT THE BILL BEFORE US. IS A MAJOR PIECE OF PUBLIC POLICY I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE TIME IS RUNNING SHORT THIS EVENING SO I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE MERITS THIS BILL AND GET CONTINUE TO GO DOWN THIS BUT THE FACT IS THIS IS A MAJOR PIECE OF PUBLIC POLICY AND WE SHOULD BE DEBATING THIS NOT FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES NOT FOR THIRTY MINUTES BUT FOR SEVERAL HOURS. WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS BILL LAST WEEK MY STAFF SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO BE AN AYE WHY BECAUSE I SUPPORTED EIGHTY USE JUST A LAST YEAR TWO YEARS AGO. BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT ADDING EIGHTY USE IT'S NOT. THIS WILL CHANGE THE FABRIC OF CALIFORNIA. IT WILL CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH IS WHY ALL OF US BELIEVE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL AND DECISION TO MAKE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT'S WHY A MEMBER FROM GLENDALE.AND A MEMBER FROM LA ARE ONE WAY AND SOMEBODY FROM A MEMBER FROM OAKLAND AND SAN LUIS OBISPO OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND IT SEEMS TO ME. MISTER SPEAKER. MISTER MESS PLEASE PROCEED- I JUST WANT TO MAKE THIS LAST POINT. BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN I'VE HEARD THIS FROM MEMBERS OVER AND OVER AND OVER THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION BELIEVING THAT ALL THE DECISIONS THAT ARE HERE BEING MADE FROM THE TOP DOWN. IN FACT I HEARD FROM OF ONE OF MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES YESTERDAY. TOLD ME FELT LIKE WE WERE JUST BACK UP DANCERS. FOR MAYBE FOR JUST A FEW LEADERS. AND THE TRUTH IS IT ISN'T UPON US AS MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. AND COMING UPON US AS MEMBERS OF THIS BODY TO PROPERLY. INSTITUTE OUR WILL OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RULES BEING A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND A BILL LIKE THIS I COULD HAVE SUPPORTED. I STILL COULD SUPPORT MAYBE NEXT YEAR. BUT NOT HIS YEAR BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO PROPERLY DEBATED. MR THIS AREA YOUR RECOGNIZE COLLEAGUES I'M GONNA BE BRIEF BECAUSE WE HAVE A FEW MORE BILLS TO GO I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH ALL OF YOU. IN THE PORTION OF THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THAT I REPRESENT. IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE ENTIRE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. IN THE ENTIRE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH THREE OF US RIGHT HERE REPRESENT. THERE ARE OVER TEN THOUSAND HOUSES SINGLE FAMILY HOUSES.% THAT ARE OWNED BY VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES. NOW IMAGINE IF ALL OF THOSE PROPERTIES WERE SUB DIVIDED RIGHT NOW. AND PUT BACK ON TO THE MARKET. CAN YOU JUST IMAGINE THE LEVEL OF CONGESTION AND IMPACT. I'M JUST GIVING YOU ONE SMALL EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL OF DOING SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW IT BENEFITS. SMALL MOM AND POP INDIVIDUAL OWNERS. BUT THE REAL BIGGER GAME IS THE WEALTH COMPANIES THAT THE MANAGEMENT COME WEALTH MANAGEMENT COMPANIES THAT ARE SITTING ON THOUSANDS OF PROPERTIES WAITING FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROFIT. SO I RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. DAVIS'S ARIAN. MR OBERNOLTE. BUT MR ROBBIE BRIEF- I RISE IN OPPOSITION SB ELEVEN TWENTY IN COLLEGE I STRUGGLED WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE GENERALLY MY PHILOSOPHY IS LIBERTARIAN AND I FIGURE IF SOMEONE WANTS TO SUBDIVIDE THEIR LOT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO BUILD A DUPLEX WHY SHOULD THEY NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THINKING IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THAT PHILOSOPHY WIDELY NEWS WILL DO LAND USE PLANNING AT ALL WHY DO WE ALLOW. LOCAL COUNTIES AND CITIES THE ABILITY TO SAY WE WANT THIS BILL HERE WE WANT THAT BUILD HERE. ALONG WITH THIS BILL IS IT'S A HUGE CHANGE. TO LAND USE POLICY IN CALIFORNIA LITTLE THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST SIX YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE- HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT.

WE HAVE A PROCESS SET UP FOR JURY SELECTION AND IT IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN UNBIASED. JURY SELECTION AND YOU WILL HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES FROM BOTH PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND FROM DISTRICT ATTORNEYS THAT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT WOULD UNDULY BIAS. THE JURY. AND UNFORTUNATELY I KNOW THAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS A GOOD ONE. BECAUSE I KNOW THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW WHAT HER HEART IS ABOUT THIS BILL. BUT AS AS COUNTLESS. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO ACTUALLY BROUGHT THIS UP IN COMMITTEE. THAT MANY TIMES HE HAS ASKED THESE EXACT QUESTIONS. IN ORDER TO GET OUT THE UNBIASED NATURE. OF THE JUROR AND TO ENSURE THAT SOMEONE IS NOT GOING TO BE BIASED AGAINST THE CLIENT ON BOTH SIDES. WHETHER YOU'RE A DEFENDANT. IN A CRIMINAL CASE OR- YOU ARE THE PROSECUTOR TRYING TO ENSURE THAT JURY IS GOING TO BE UNBIASED AGAINST. AN OFFICER OR WHOEVER IS YOU KNOW WHAT OR OR THE PEOPLE IN THAT CASE. YOU'RE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT A COMPLETELY UNBIASED JURY WE HAVE THESE THINGS IN PLACE FOR A REASON THAT YOU CAN ASK THESE QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN DO PEREMPTORY STRIKES. AND SO. I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF EMOTION BEHIND THESE TYPES OF. BILLS THAT ARE BEING PUT FORWARD BUT WE STILL NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS DUE PROCESS WE DO NEED TO ENSURE. THAT THERE IS AN UNBIASED FAIR APPROACH. THAT YOU DO GET TRIED BY A JURY OF YOUR PEERS. AND THAT THOSE BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS WHICH MIGHT BE. ABOUT YOUR HISTORY WITH. LAW ENFORCEMENT YOUR HISTORY IT MAY BE HAVING A FELONY OR HAVING SOMEONE WHO. DID HAVE A FELONY THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THESE NEED TO BE I THINK THAT NEED TO DO THIS.

LAST SESSION. MISS GONZALES. WITH THAT MR HOLDEN WE'RE GOING TO START WITH YOU MISS GONZALEZ WILL BE ON DECK MR HOLDEN OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY. NOT TOO LONG AGO. BUT IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN. THAT THE MAJORITY LEADER AND I WERE SWORN IN AND BECAME SEAT MATES FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE WAS A STANDOUT IN OUR CLASS. REYES YOUNG YOUNG AGE WELL KNOWN LAST NINE I LIKE ME. IN FACT WE ESTABLISHED A COMMONALITY ON OUR FIRST WERE IN AND DAY AS OUR FATHERS BOTH FORMER LEGISLATORS SAT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. WITH US ON THE FLOOR. BUT SINCE THEN HE HAS SHOWN AS SHOWN AS THE THOUGHTFUL HARDWORKING STATESMAN HE IS AS A PERSON HE IS A LOYAL. AND DEMONSTRATES INTEGRITY TO THE HIGHEST ORDER. IT ALSO IS A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR AND A CONTAGIOUS LAUGH THAT BRINGS JOY TO YOUR SPIRIT. HE IS PROMOTED CAMARADERIE AS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BASEBALL ANNUAL BASEBALL GAME. UNFORTUNATELY THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LAST ONE FOR. HE LED LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO GIVE PARENTS A PATIENTS THE RIGHT TO TRY UTILIZE THE TECH SECTOR FOR THE GOOD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND ESTABLISH CALIFORNIA'S OFFICIAL SPORT SURFING. WHILE SERVING HE STARTED A FAMILY. WE SEE HIM BEAM WITH PRIDE WHEN HIS WIFE ELISE. AND THE THREE CHILDREN CHARLIE HARDLY AND CREW ARE NEARBY. THEY HAVE NOT JUST BEEN HIS JOY THEY HAVE ALSO INSPIRED HIS WORK AS HE LED THE EFFORT ON DIAPER CHANGING TABLES AND ALL PUBLIC BATHROOMS REGARDLESS OF GENDER. AS MAJORITY LEADER HAS MANAGED THE FLOOR WITH PROFESSIONALISM. EFFICIENCY AND FAIRNESS NEVER AFRAID TO RAISES MY TO MAINTAIN ORDER ON THE FLOOR. I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THAT JOB IS NOT AN EASY ONE ESPECIALLY DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF SESSION. HE IS MANAGED THESE LAST DAYS WELL OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. BUT DURING HIS PARTICULARLY UNUSUAL I'M TRYING SESSION IS DEMONSTRATED HE IS A TRUE LEADER. MY ONLY REGRET IN IS THAT WE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON A BILL TOGETHER. BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU DO IN THE FUTURE AND I KNOW IT WILL BE GREAT. BECAUSE I KNOW YOUR FUTURE IS BRIGHT GOD BLESS AFFRONT. THANK YOU MR HOLDEN THIS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RIGHT. THANK YOU. MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE I GOT SWORN IN AND WALKED BACK HERE AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SEATED RIGHT IN FRONT OF IAN CALDERON. AND AT THAT MOMENT I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW I JUST ASSUMED HE WAS SOME RICH KID THAT USED HIS NAME TO GET ELECTED IN THE OFFICE. WATCHING SERVICIOS WHEN NO ONE WAS LOOKING. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. LIKE I'M SURE WE ALL FELT THAT JUST MADE YOU LOVE HIM. IN QUICKLY BECAME. SOMETIMES I SAY LIKE NINE OTHER CHILD BUT MORE LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER. WE HAVE SOME ROUGH PATCHES WE DIDN'T HAVE A PATCHES BUT THERE WERE SOME ROUGH PATCHES. AND WE REALLY GREW CLOSE. IN AN IBM. HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE OF BEING IN THE DOGHOUSE TOGETHER FOR ABOUT A YEAR. DECIDING THAT LOYALTY MATTERED MORE. THE BEING IN A GOOD POSITION IN THIS HOUSE AND WE PAY FOR TOGETHER. IN IN THAT YEAR HE TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT DIPLOMACY. I TAUGHT HIM A LOT ABOUT PUT YOUR PAPER. AND WE WORK TOGETHER. AND WORKS TO ENSURE THAT THE DIRECTION OF THIS HOUSE WAS LED. BY SOMEBODY WE PEOPLE AND SO MANY OF YOU BELIEVED IN. I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE NAME THAT'LL COME UP IN A CONVERSATION ON THIS FLOOR IT EVEN WON'T SAY. I GOT ITI'M GONNA GO TALK TO THAT PERSON WERE CLOSE. AND YOU NEVER QUESTION IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE REALLY DOES HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. HE'S BEEN THERE FOR YOU HE HEARD JAIL. HE LISTENED HE- HE TRIED TO FIX SOMETHING FOR YOU. AND I DON'T KNOW MANY LEADERS WHO DO THAT WHO SPEND MORE TIME LISTENING THAN TALKING. WHO'S BEEN MORE EFFORT TO FIX THINGS THEY GETTING SOMETHING FOR THEMSELVES WITHOUT FEAR. I LIKE SO MANY OF YOU HAVE A GREAT HONOR WATCHING HIM KIND OF GROW UP. GET MARRIED TO LEASE. THE MOST FABULOUS WOMAN IN THE WORLD. HAVE THE MOST ADORABLE CHILDREN. CHARLIE AND HEART LEAN CREW. REALLY SAD WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO HOLD HER YET. BUT ALL OF THAT I REALIZED. LAST YEAR. IN NOVEMBER WHEN HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO. SEVEN TIME A FAMILY RATHER THAN RUN FOR REELECTION. HOW INCREDIBLY SINCERE THAT WAS HOW MANY PEOPLE RUN FOR OFFICE THAT ARE SO INCREDIBLY SINCERE ABOUT THEIR VALUES THAT THEY SAY NO AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS WHAT MATTERS TO ME. I WANT TO BE WITH MY FAMILY. AND I THINK THERE WERE FOLKS YOU KNOW OUT IN LA LA LAND NOT AMONG US WHO THOUGHT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON RIGHT THE OTHER ISSUES GOING TO DROP. NOW. HE JUST WAS DOING WHAT WAS BEST FOR HIS FAMILY JUST LIKE HE TIME AND TIME AGAIN DID WHAT WAS BEST FOR THIS HOUSE DID WHAT WAS BEST FOR ALL OF US. MAKE SURE HE WAS THE ONE. THE GOTCHA ALL TOGETHER ON A SOFTBALL FIELD. MAKE SURE EVERYBODY FELT INCLUDED MAKE SURE EVERY BOOK EVERY VOICE WAS HEARD. WE SERVE HERE FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF YEARS. YOU'RE GONNA MOVE ON IT'S NICE THERE YOUR COINS IS. BUT I REALLY WOULD QUESTION HOW MANY OF US ARE GONNA LEAVE TONIGHT SAYING GOODBYE TO OUR REAL FRIENDS. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A REAL FRIENDS AS HE LEADS TO. SOMEBODY WHO YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO CHECK IN WITH. HOW SELDOM DOES THAT HAPPEN. I WANT TO AS HE LEADS TO. GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO HIS CHIEF OF STAFF. TOM WHITE I KNOW THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD BUT LIKE IF YOU GOT IT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY. WHO ALWAYS SEEM TO FIND ME WHEN I WAS LOST DIRECT ME THE RIGHT WAY I KIND OF FEEL LIKE EVAN ASSIGNED HIM TO I. HAVE EVAN. AND INDIANA SIGNED INTO FINDING ME LOST SOMEWHERE ON SOME FLOOR. IN TELLING ME WHERE I SHOULD GO BACK TO AN OF TOM'S HERE. OR WHEN I'M STANDING HERE LOOKING LOST SO WE'RE TO HOPEFULLY NOT MISS TOM HE'LL STILL BE HERE.

WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE ON ME TO MAKE ME THE MAJORITY LEADER AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKED. PROBABLY TO ABOUT. ME IN THAT pPOSITION- AND YOU HAD FAITH IN ME. AND YOU BELIEVED IN ME. AND THAT MEANT THE WORLD TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE EVERYTHING THAT I. COULD HAVE DONE IN THIS HOUSE THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVED. I WAS THE BEST SUITED FOR BECAUSE I TRULY CARE ABOUT THE OPERATIONS HOUSE AND HOW TO GET IT DONE. BUT WE WENT THROUGH A LOT OF THINGS DURING THAT SPEAKERSHIP RACE AND GETTING HIM TO WHERE HE HAS TO BE OUR LEADER- BUT I WILL SAY THE REASON WHY I SUPPORTED HIM EARLY ON IT WAS WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT TOOK TO MAKE SURE. HE BECAME SPEAKER. WAS BECAUSE OF HIS INTENTIONS AND WHY HE WANTED TO BE IN THAT POSITION. IT'S EASY WHEN YOU BECOME- YOU GET IN POWER TO LET THE TITLE AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH THAT TITLE- THAT BE THE MOTIVATION FOR YOU SEEKING THAT POSITION- AND FOR HIM IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE TITLE WAS NEVER ABOUT WHAT CAME WITH THAT POSITION. THAT MOTIVATED HIM TO WANT TO BECOME THE SPEAKER. AND THAT WAS BECAUSE THAT WAS WHY. I SUPPORTED HIM BECAUSE HE WANTED IT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS HE WANTED IT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE THAT HE CAN MAKE BY BEING IN. THAT POSITION. AND I ALSO WANTED FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WAS MY FRIEND. HE HAS A GOOD HEART HE WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAND WITH YOUR FRIENDS. AND HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS. SO I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE SUCCESS THAT I'VE HAD IN SACRAMENTO I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE TIME THAT I'VE HAD IN SACRAMENTO. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I'VE HAD THE AMAZING TIME THAT I'VE HAD UP HERE WITHOUT HIM. TAKING THAT STEP TO BELIEVE IN ME AT A TIME WHEN I KNOW. IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM.
