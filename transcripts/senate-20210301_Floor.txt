SENATE RESOLUTION TEN BY SENATOR PAN RELATIVE TO JAPANESE AMERICAN CONCENTRATION CAMPS CENTER PAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM RESIDENT SENATORS TODAY I RISE AS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS 2% S. R. TEN RESOLUTION TO COMMEMORATE THE SEVENTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY OF REMEMBRANCE. ON FEBRUARY NINETEENTH NINETEEN FORTY TWO PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT SIGNED EXECUTIVE ORDER NINETY SIXTY SIX UNDER HICH MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE INCARCERATED TEN DIFFERENT CAMPS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN UNITED STATES DURING WORLD WAR TWO. JAPANESE AMERICANS WERE TARGETED STRIPPED OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND IMPRISONED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR HERITAGE. SEVENTY NINE YEARS LATER WE'RE STILL REMEMBERING THIS PAINFUL HISTORY AND REFLECTING ON THESE UNJUST POLICIES ROOTED FROM DISCRIMINATION SYSTEMIC RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA. AS WE ARE FORTUNATE WITNESSING A LARGE UPTICK IN HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS STUDER OF RACIST RHETORIC ABOUT THE COVE IT PANDEMIC. IN THE LAST MONTH THE BAY AREA HAS PARTICULARLY SEEN MORE MORE ATTACKS DIRECTED TOWARDS SENIORS FACT ONE EIGHTY FOUR YEAR OLD MAN OF THAI DESCENT WAS PUSHED TO HIS DEATH. IN A NUMBER OF THE ATTACK. EXECUTIVE ORDER NINETY SIXTY SIX IS A STARK REMINDER THAT WE MUST ACT WITH DETERMINATION TO NEVER REPEAT. THE SAME BETRAYAL OF OUR VALUES AS A NATION AND TO PROTECT THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF. ALL AMERICANS. I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN REMEMBERING THE ISSUANCE OF EXECUTIVE ORDER NINETY SIXTY SIX. I CONTINUE TO SEEK OUT ITS LESSONS. BY ADOPTING S. R. TEN HIRE DRIVERS THANK YOU. SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MORE GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO FOR INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION. AS A MEMBER OF THE EIGHTY AYE LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES IN SACRAMENTO JUST MADE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE PREVIOUS HARDSHIP THAT ARE ASIAN AMERICAN ANCESTORS HAVE SUFFERED SO THAT THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT NEVER HAPPENS TODAY. WITHOUT THESE PREVIOUS SACRIFICES PEOPLE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO NINE WOULD NOT BE SERVING IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE TODAY- ROUGHLY THIRTY THREE THOUSAND JAPANESE VETERANS FOUGHT BRAVELY FOR A COUNTRY DURING WAR TO. IF THEIR FAMILIES WERE INCARCERATED BEHIND BARBED WIRE YOU TO FDR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER NINETY SIXTY SIX SOMETHING THAT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY. AS ONE OF THE WORST ACTIONS THAT HIS PRESIDENCY. NOW WE KNOW THAT THE SCAPEGOATING OF ASIAN AMERICANS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE VERY FIRST DAYS OF ASIAN IMMIGRATION TO THIS COUNTRY. WHETHER THE YELLOW PERIL RHETORIC WHETHER THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT WEATHER IS THE JAPANESE INTERNMENT CAMP- SO MANY OTHERS WE CANNOT KEEP REPEATING HISTORY IN THIS WAY. AND YET WE RUN THAT RISK UNLESS WE LEARN OUR HISTORY. WE LIKE TO SAY THESE TYPES OF THINGS NEVER WILL HAPPEN AGAIN BUT THEY WILL UNLESS WE KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES. AND OUR NEXT GENERATIONS OF HISTORY. AS I NOTED WITH THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS STANDING IN SOLIDARITY NOT JUST WITH OTHER API'S BUT WITH OTHER HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS IS SO IMPORTANT. AND I ASK YOU ALL TO STAND WITH US TODAY IN SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU MANAGER. CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE A SHARE THE MILITARY VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. IN SUPPORT OF S. R. TEN WHICH DECLARES FEBRUARY NINETEENTH IS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE REGARDING THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE INCARCERATION OF AMERICANS OF JACK JAPANESE ANCESTRY DURING WORLD WAR TWO. IN PARTICULAR AS A FELLOW VETERAN I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE FOUR FORTY SECOND INFANTRY REGIMENT OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY. NO TO ALL OF US AS THE FOUR FOUR TWO THE FIGHTING FOUR FOUR TWO. THE FOUR FOUR TWO IS AN EFFORT TO REGIMENT. WHO SERVED DURING WORLD WAR TWO WITH HONOR AND DIGNITY BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY. THE FOUR FORTY SECOND IS BEST KNOWN FOR ITS HISTORY AS A FIGHTING UNIT. COMPOSED OF ALMOST ENTIRELY SECOND GENERATION AMERICAN SOLDIERS OF JAPANESE JAPANESE ANCESTRY WHO ENLISTED. IN THE WAR. IN SPITE OF THE INCARCERATION THAT WAS HAPPENING BACK HOME WITH HER FELLOW FAMILY MEMBERS WERE KARCHER RATED. THE FOUR FORTY SECOND BRAVELY FOUGHT IN THE EUROPEAN THEATER IT WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. IN THE VETERANS COMMUNITY WE HONOR THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN FACT. THE GO FOR BROKE MONUMENT IN LITTLE TOKYO DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES NEAR MY DISTRICT. IN THE DISTRICT OF MY COLLEAGUES TO MY RIGHT. AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IT COMMEMORATES THE JAPANESE AMERICANS WHO SERVED THE UNITED STATES ARMY DURING MORE WORK TO. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT HISTORY NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT THE ENTIRE WORLD. FOR THESE REASONS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. R. TEN AND THANK YOU AUTHOR FROM SACRAMENTO FOR BRINGING IT FOR TODAY. THANK YOU. SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S. R. TEN RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY NINETEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE TO INCREASE THE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE INCARCERATION OF AMERICANS OF JAPANESE ANCESTRY. DURING WORLD WAR TWO. FEBRUARY NINETEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE MARKED THE SEVENTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT AUTHORIZED JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT DURING WORLD WAR TWO. THIS POLICY WAS A GRAVE INJUSTICE AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS OF JAPANESE ANCESTRY PRESIDENT GERALD FORD ISSUED A PROCLAMATION WHICH TERMINATED THIS POLICY AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN SIGNED THE FEDERAL CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT INTO LAW. WHICH DECLARED THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AUTHORIZING THE INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE AMERICANS WAS NOT JUSTIFIED DAY MILITARY NECESSITY. THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT HAD THREE CO SPONSORS INCLUDING THEN SENATOR PETE WILSON WHO LATER BECAME THE THIRTY SIX GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. THAT STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS DURING WORLD WAR TWO HAS BEEN BASED ON QUOTE RACE PREJUDICE WAR HYSTERIA AND A FAILURE OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN QUOTE AS APPROVED AS OPPOSED TO LEGITIMATE SECURITY REASONS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A FORMAL APOLOGY TO SURVIVORS WHO EXPERIENCED THE DARKEST DAYS OF AMERICAN HISTORY. SO TODAY WE GET MARK THIS DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR THOSE COUNTLESS AMERICAN FAMILIES OF JAPANESE DESCENT WHO ENTERS SUFFERING. OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHO DID SUFFER. AND IT'S GREAT THAT WE HAVE THESE GOVERNMENT RESOLUTIONS BUT IT TAKES MORE THAN THAT IT TAKES. IT TAKES FAMILIES- AS A YOUNG BOY I REMEMBER MY PARENTS TAKING ME MY SISTER TO THE MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP OFF HIGHWAY THREE NINETY FIVE IN INYO COUNTY. AND A GENERATION LATER I TOOK MY CHILDREN BECAUSE WE CAN NEVER FORGET THESE TYPE ACCESS BECAUSE WE DON'T HISTORY WILL REPEAT ITSELF AGAIN. SO AGAIN I PROBABLY STAND- WITH MY FRIEND FROM SACRAMENTO AS AN AYE VOTE FOR SR TEN. SENATOR BAKER. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION DECLARING FEBRUARY NINETEENTH A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE BUT MY COLLEAGUE WHO JUST SPOKE I TOOK MY FAMILY LAST SUMMER TO THE MINDS IN OUR CAMP HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS WERE IN TURN THERE IT WAS A STARK REMINDER OF THIS INJUSTICE AND GLAD WE HAVE THIS RESOLUTION TO REMEMBER THIS. IS MY CALLING IRVINE SAID. IF WE DON'T REMEMBER THE HISTORY. WE ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT AND WE HEARD RECENTLY ALSO WAS REFERENCED THE RECENT TAX- ASSAULTS AND BATTERIES INSULTS AGAINST MEMBERS OF OUR ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY I WAS AT A RALLY THIS WEEKEND BUT WE STOOD UP FOR ASIANS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I'M PROUD TO STAND SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION TODAY. THANK YOU. SENATOR DRAWS A. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. R. TEN IN REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR INCARCERATION OF JAPANESE AMERICANS. AND ALSO BECAUSE- SIMILAR ATTACKS HAVE BEEN WAGED AGAINST OTHER GROUPS IN THIS COUNTRY. IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES THE SUIT. SUITORS WERE ATTACKED IN LOS ANGELES WHERE THOUSANDS WERE BEATEN UP THIS IS AT THE SAME TIME BUT THE SAME KIND OF RACIAL ATTACKS WERE TAKING PLACE IN MOBILE ALABAMA BEAUMONT TEXAS DETROIT AND NEW YORK CITY. THEN THERE WAS OPERATION LEAD BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. WHEN THEY WERE MILITARY STYLE TACTICS WERE USED TO DEPORT THOUSANDS INCLUDING MEXICAN AMERICAN CITIZENS. COLLEAGUES WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT WE DO BOTH INDIVIDUALLY. AS A LEGISLATURE AND AS A SOCIETY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR BRADFORD. PRESIDENT AS CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT ABOUT SARGSYAN TO REFLECT ON THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF JAPANESE HERITAGE THAT WERE INTERNED IN THIS COUNTRY DURING WORLD WAR TWO AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO GREW UP IN GUARDINO WHICH WAS APPROVED FOR DONNELLY JAPANESE COMMUNITY IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WHEN I WAS A KID I HAVE PLENTY OF FRIENDS WHO HAD. IT'S AND GRANDPARENTS WHO WERE IN TURN NOT ONLY MANZANAR BUT IN TULE LAKE TOO. MANY OF THEM REFERRED TO AS NO ONE ELSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO REFUSE TO SIGN A DECLARATION DECLARING THEIR LOYALTY. TO THE UNITED STATES EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE BUT DENOUNCING THEIR JAPANESE HERITAGE WHICH THEY REFUSED TO DO. AND MANY AT TULE LAKE LAKE WORKFORCE IN THE HEART. OF WINTER THE STANDING IN THE COLD AND SNOW IN THEIR UNDERWEAR AND BE TORTURED REPEATEDLY TO GET THEM TO SIGN A FORM WHICH THEY REFUSED TO DO. YET AND STILL MANY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS ONE OFF THE FIGHT. AS STATED IN pWORLD WAR TWO. KNOWN AS THE FOUR FOUR TWO THE GOAL FOR BRINGING. SOME OF THE BRAVEST MEN IN WORLD TWO WHO FOUGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY DESPITE HAVING MANY OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. INTERNED HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND AS A MEMBER WHO'S BEEN APPOINTED TO THE REPARATIONS COMMITTEE. LOOKING AT THAT WHICH WAS STOLEN FROM AFTER AMERICANS WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS STOLEN FROM JAPANESE AMERICANS BECAUSE OF WE KNOW OUR HISTORY WE KNOW BACK WHICH IS NOW PALACE BIRDIES. WHICH PRIMARILY JAPANESE FARMLAND IN THE EARLY FORTIES IN VERY LITTLE OF THAT WAS EVER RETURNED TO THEM AFTER THEY RETURNED HOME. BUT THERE WAS A SECTION THAT DID BELONG TO THEM THAT WAS RETURNED AFTER WORLD WAR TWO. AND I WAS LITTLE TOKYO AND DOWN TO LOS ANGELES AND THE REASON IT WAS RETURNED TO ON BECAUSE IT WAS PROTECTED BY. THE AMERICANS. AND THAT WAS CAUGHT BROWNSVILLE BECAUSE AFRICAN AMERICANS MOVED INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES MOVED INTO THOSE HOMES. MOVED INTO THOSE BUSINESSES AND PROTECTED THOSE BUSINESSES MAINTAIN THOSE BUSINESSES AND HOMES AND RETURN DON'T WITHOUT FUSS NOR MONTHS. UPON THOSE INDIVIDUALS BEING RETURNED SO IT'S BEEN A LONG ALLIANCE BETWEEN. JAPANESE AMERICANS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS MY GRANDPARENTS LIVED AND TOKYO IN JAPAN FOR NUMBER OF YEARS AND MY GRANDMOTHER WAS FLUENT IN JAPANESE AND SHE INSTILLED IN ME AT EARLY AGE. THE LOCAL STRONG TIES. AND CULTURAL- AWARENESS OF JAPANESE ARE I STAND STRONG TO OF US UNDERSTANDING THE HISTORY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY NEVER FORGETTING IT THANK YOU. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ESTARá TEN AS- SENATOR REPRESENTING A LARGE- AREA OF API COMMUNITY I REALLY WANT TO OFFER MY SUPPORT AS WELL I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALWAYS REMEMBER OUR HISTORY AND REALLY RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE AGREE JUST MISTAKES WE'VE DONE AND MADE ON BEHALF OF FOR THIS COUNTRY AND SO I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT BECAUSE AS OUR GREAT SENATOR FOR MOLLY SHARED- MAKE. AMERICANS DEALT WITH A LOT OF INJUSTICES IN THAT ERA OUR FRIEND FROM GUARDINO JUST STATE IT. OUR FRIENDS AFRICAN AMERICAN FRIENDS HAVE DEALT WITH SUCH INJUSTICES AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE STAND TOGETHER IN SOLIDARITY AND OFFER ARC. FOR THIS COUNTRY AND THEY WERE TREATED SO UNFAIRLY AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE TREATED SO UNJUSTLY I DO HAVE- INTERNMENT CAMP. THAT WAS IN MY DISTRICT AND SO THAT'S ALWAYS A REMINDER FOR ME. TO ALWAYS REMEMBER NEVER REPEAT THOSE MISTAKES AND COLLECTIVELY I THINK WE NEED TO SAY THANK YOU TO JAPANESE AMERICANS. FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE DONE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COUNTRY THANK YOU. SENATOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE L. G. CAUCUS BUT TO ALSO SPEAK ON THAT S. R. TEN- WE ARE OLD MEANING MAKING CREATURES WHO FULL FORM OUR LIVES AROUND STORIES OF OUR LIVES WHEN I WAS A SOCIAL WORKER DOING HOSPICE WORK- IN THE IN THE STOCK INTERLOCUTOR THERE'S A LOT OF JAPANESE FAMILIES WHO HAD SETTLED THERE AND- AND SPENT TIME IN CAMPS AND I WAS ALWAYS AMAZED WHEN I WOULD GO INTO A JAPANESE HOME. AND THE PICTURE OF THE CAMPS WOULD BE CENTERED UP ON THE WALL AND THAT WAS PART OF THE TOUR OF THE HOUSE IT WOULD TAKE ME TO SEE THE PICTURE OF THE CAMPS. AND WOOD NO BETTER. BUT WITH THE WITH THE THIS IS A PART OF OUR LIFE. THAT WE WANT TO SHARE AND THEN THE STRENGTH THE FAMILY. STILL TOGETHER THEN TOWARD THE END OF SOMEONE'S LIFE. CARING FOR SOMEONE. WHEN I WAS IN. IN IN IN COLLEGE IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AIDS EPIDEMIC AND I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY. IN COLLEGE CLASSES IS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT INTERNMENT CAMPS. PLACES THAT WE WOULD PUT PEOPLE TO KEEP US SAFE WHICH IS THE SAME THING WE DID. DURING THE WAR WE PUT JAPANESE PEOPLE AWAY. TO KEEP US SAFE BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID. I THINK WE NEED TO PUSH BACK THEN WE CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE PUSHED BACK ON THE HIV AIDS CRISIS AND WE DID- BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE VIGILANT TO THESE KIND OF THINGS THESE ARE MESSAGES WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE. WITH PICTURES OF CAMPS ON THEIR ON THEIR LIVING ROOM WALLS. THAT THEY ORGANIZE A STORY OF THEIR LIVES AROUND THAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE TO BE. THAT RESILIENT TO RISE ABOVE. THE HATRED OF YOUR VERY COUNTRY. WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT LGBT PEOPLE IN THE CAMPS DURING THAT TIME WE DO KNOW ABOUT. JIRO A NEW MONTH. BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE TO BE IN A CLOSET IN A CAMP WAS REALLY DIFFICULT. SO WE CAN JUST IMAGINE THE KIND THE COMPOUNDING. OF OPPRESSION THAT IT CAN OCCUR AT THIS TIME SO. I RISE ON BEHALF OF S. R. TEN AND ASKED US ALL TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY THAT WE WILL NEVER FORGET AND WE WILL NEVER REPEAT THE MISTAKES. OF THE PAST THANK YOU MEMBERS. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I FIRST OF ALL I THINK ALL OF MY- COLLEAGUES FOR SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS R. TEN AND- FOR THE DAY OF REMEMBRANCE- REMEMBERING HIS CERTAINLY- VERY IMPORTANT BUT NINE US AND WE ALSO NEED TO RESOLVE TO NOT ALLOW THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN AGAIN WE CANNOT. CHANGE HISTORY. BUT WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE. WHAT THAT HIRED AN AYE VOTE ON S. R. TEN THANK YOU. MEMBERS IF THERE IS NO OBJECTION THIS ITEM IS ELIGIBLE FOR UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL. SEEING NO OBJECTION I THIRTY FIVE KNOWS ZERO THE MEASURE THE- RESOLUTION PASSES. MEMBERS ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWELVE SENATOR ATKINS. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL SEVEN BY SENATOR ATKINS AN ACTUAL RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND OCCURRING THE URGENCY THERE OF TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY MADAM PRETEND THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE TO PRESENT SB SEVEN WHICH EXTENDS A SUNSET OF EXISTING CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT OR SEEK WHAT STREAMLINING PROVISIONS. AND ENABLE SMALL SCALE HOUSING PROJECTS TO BENEFIT FROM THE STREAMLINING AS WELL. IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC AND WHILE WE HAVE MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES TO TACKLE DIRECTLY RELATED TO MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. WE CANNOT LOSE FOCUS ON OTHER EQUALLY IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES SUCH AS HOUSING PRODUCTION. I MADE A PLEDGE ON THIS FLOOR WELL OVER A YEAR AGO THAT THE SENATE WILL FOCUS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION. WE MADE GOOD ON THAT PLEDGE AND WE PUT FORTH A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF BILLS TO INCENTIVIZE AN INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION AND OUR STATE. WELL WE WERE NOT COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL AND GETTING THESE BILLS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WE WERE CLOSE. BY ALONG WITH A GROUP OF LEAD SENATORS ON HOUSING. SENATORS MCGUIRE CABALLERO DRAW SO GONZALEZ ROTH RUBIO CORTESE AND SKINNER. WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT ON THESE BILLS. TO MAKE THEM LAW AND I PARTICULARLY WANT TO EXTEND MY APPRECIATION. TO SENATOR MCGUIRE FOR- PRESENTING THIS BILL IN- EQ COMMITTEE AND APPROPRIATIONS. BUT OUR WORK CONTINUES AND S. B. SEVEN AS PART OF THE WORK DONE ON THE HOUSING PRODUCTION PACKAGE OF BILLS TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEED FOR HOUSING SUPPLY. IN OUR STATE. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB NINE HUNDRED WHICH IS STABILISED A NEW PROCESS UNDER SECRETIVE STREAMLINED ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD PAPERWORK. AN EXPEDITED LEGAL CHALLENGES FOR LARGE MULTI BENEFIT HOUSING. CLEAN ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING PROJECTS THAT HAVE A CAPITAL INVESTMENT OF OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AB NINE HUNDRED SUNSET ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I HAD A BILL LAST YEAR TO EXTEND THE SUNSET AND THE BILL PASSED BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY WITH LARGE MAJORITY VOTES. BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET TO THE SENATE FLOOR LAST YEAR DUE TO THE END OF SESSION TIME CONSTRAINTS. SB SEVEN EXTENDS AB NINE HUNDRED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND EXPANDED SO THAT IT WOULD APPLY TO MUCH SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS AND THIS IS SO THAT ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF THIS TOOL NOT JUST LARGE CITIES BUT RULE COMMUNITIES ALSO. WERE CURRENT AB NINE HUNDRED LAW NOW SAYS IT ONLY- BUT THAT ONLY PROJECTS OF A HUNDRED MILLION OR GREATER OR ELIGIBLE SB SEVEN LOWERS THAT THRESHOLD TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS QUALIFY. LIKEWISE THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE HOUSING PROJECTS AVE AT LEAST 50% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE REQUIRED IN STATE LAW. AND TO DATE AB NINE HUNDRED HAS RESULTED IN AT LEAST FOURTEEN SEPARATE MEGA PROJECTS REPRESENTING OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR STATE. ACCORDING TO INFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AND THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH THESE PROJECTS HAVE PROVIDED OVER TEN THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS. AND CREATED THOUSANDS OF NEW HIGH WAGE CONSTRUCTION AND PERMANENT JOBS. SINCE THE AB NINE HUNDRED PROGRAM SUNSET ON JANUARY FIRST WE HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE FOR APPROVAL DO NOT HAVE TO BEGIN THAT APPROVAL PROCESS AGAIN. SB SEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN GENERATING HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THE STATE AS WELL AS ENSURING COMMUNITIES LARGE AND SMALL. BENEFIT FROM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING GENERATING QUALITY HIGH PAYING JOBS. BY USING PROPERLY SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKERS. SB SEVEN IS A KEY PART IN FULFILLING THIS PLEDGE TO SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA IT'S SUPPORTED BY A BROAD RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SENATOR BURGESS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I WANT TO INTRODUCING THIS MATTER- I THINK WE KNOW. OUR HOUSING SHORTAGES ARE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY- AND THE THICKENING OF GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY SON TELEVISION PROGRAM RECENTLY THAT. HELP EXPLAIN THIS CONCEPT- AND IT MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. IS THAT WE HAVE CREATED A NUMBER OF SYSTEMS IN GOVERNMENT WHETHER THEY BE CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE OVERSIGHTS. FOR JUST YOUR CREDIT PROCESS SEES THAT ENCUMBER INCREASE CHALLENGES FOR US TO DEAL WITH ARM MOST IMMEDIATE NEEDS. NOWHERE IS THIS MORE SIGNIFICANT AND GLARING AS A SEQUEL. NOW I HAVE INTRODUCED BILLS- MY FIRST YEAR REGARDING C. ESPECIALLY TO PLAY INSTEAD TO HOUSING AND STREAMLINING. BUT I GOTTA SAY EVEN THOUGH WE ARE. WE'RE DEALING WITH- THE PANDEMIC AND IT WILL NO DOUBT. TAKE ALL OF THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE HAVE THE COURAGE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. ON ITS MERITS IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWO. BECAUSE I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE I'M GONNA VOTE FOR TODAY. BUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE STREAMLINING SEQUEL FOR PRIORITY PROJECTS UNDERLIES THE FACT THAT SEQUEL IS NOT WORKING THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED. AND I THINK IT WE HAD OF THE BODY WE HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE. DESPITE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS IN THE PREVAILING POLITICAL WINDS OF THE TIME. WE CAN'T SIMPLY SIDELINED SPECIAL PROJECTS AND CERTAIN NEEDS- TO DIVERT AROUND THIS CUMBERSOME PROCESS WHICH CLEARLY IS NOT DELIVERING WHAT WE NEED. ALL WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE MOVE FORWARD ON THESE THINGS. BUT IT'S EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL- THAT WE SOLVE OUR LONG TERM PROBLEMS OF HOUSING IN SICK WHAT NEEDS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT DISCUSSION. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE I STAND AS A PRODUCT- ALTER IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. I LIKE TO THINK THE PRO TEM FIRST READING THE EFFORTS AND GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AT THE TABLE TO HELP. CRAFT THIS BILL ALONG WITH OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BY THE PRO TEM. MEMBERS FAMILIES CONTINUE TO LOSE THEIR HOMES THEY CONTINUE TO CALL KREIN. URGING US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF THEM ON THE BRINK OF BEING HOMELESS. AND SO HOMES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND THIS TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE BECOMING UNAFFORDABLE FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS WHICH IS WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO TIMELY. THIS BILL IS ALSO A JOB CREATOR AND AS WE KNOW PREVENT NINETEEN HAS THREATENED TO FAMILIES ECONOMIC STABILITY. AND THIS BILL DOES BOTH IT CREATES GOOD PAYING JOBS AND HELPS BUILD HOMES FASTER AND IT ALSO HELPS STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS TO PUT THEM ON THE PATH OF HOME OWNERSHIP. WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I MET WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS IN MY OWN DISTRICT I MET WITH MY CITIES MY CITY MANAGERS EVEN THE L. A. COUNTY DELEGATION AND THE CONSENSUS IS CLEAR WE NEED. MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE SO I ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU. SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU PRESIDENT TO ARISE IS A PROUD CO AUTHORED SB SEVEN WHICH HAS ALREADY STATED- COME. BY MADAME PRO TEM AND THANK YOU FOR HER LEADERSHIP EXTENDS TWENTY TWENTY ONE SINCE IT ENACTED IN TWENTY ELEVEN BY AB NINE HUNDRED- I'M SPEAKING BECAUSE THE SENATE BILL- WILL CONTINUE AB NINE HUNDRED SUCCESS IN CREATING JOBS AND INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA BY STREAMLINING PAPERWORK. AND EXPEDITING LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LARGE MULTI BENEFIT HOUSING ENERGY MANUFACTURING PROJECTS. IN MY DISTRICT IS HOME TO ONE OF THE BUSIEST TRANSIT HUBS ON THE WEST COAST. DURRETT ON STATION IN THE DEER DOWN STATION REDEVELOPMENT AREA THIS BILL WOULD LEAD TO A TREMENDOUS INFUSION OF JOBS INCLUDING FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION JOBS. IN THE CITY OF SAN JOSE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE DIRT ON STATION. WOULD ALSO LEAD TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF FOUR THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS IN THAT AREA 25% OF WHICH WILL BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THAT PROJECT ALONE WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE NOT ONLY PERSONAL SAY. A BURKE PERCENT OCCUR COUNTY AND OF COURSE A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TERMS A HOUSING PRODUCTION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU. SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN AND APPLIED THE PRO TENS EFFORTS TO PROTEINS EFFORTS IN ELIMINATING SOME OF THE BARRIERS REYES BY SEQUEL LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW BY STREAMLINING SEQUEL LITIGATION. THEY WILL ALLOW THESE PROJECTS TO BEGIN SOONER IT WILL ELIMINATE SOME OF THE OVERLY EXPENSIVE COST ASSOCIATED WITH SEQUINS REVIEW PROCESS SAVING THE STATE TIME AND MONEY. AND WHILE WE'E DOING THIS TODAY AND IT'S A GOOD STEP WE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY NEED TO DO MORE WE NEED TO BRING MORE PRODUCT TO MARKET FOR OUR FAMILIES. RECENTLY MY WIFE AN ASSET AND I. HAD TO WAVE GOODBYE IS MY DAUGHTER. THAT SON IN LAW AND ONLY GRANDSON MOVED OUT OF STATE BECAUSE THEY COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. THEY HAD A MARGINAL TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT. THAT WAS MORE THAN THE MORTGAGE THAT MY WIFE AND I PAY SO WE HAVE TO DO MORE. AND THEN FINALLY SB SEVEN WILL ENABLE THESE DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS TO CREATE MORTGAGE PAYING JOBS SOMETHING. THE STATE DESPERATELY NEEDS IN THE TIME OF AT 9% UNEMPLOYMENT. HAS THE SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER I'M GLAD TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF MORE HOUSING AND BETTER PAYING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. SENATOR DURAZO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO ADD TO WHAT EVERY UP ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE SAYING IN A GREAT SUPPORT FOR SB SEVEN HUNDRED THANK THE PRO TEM FOR TAKING THE LEADERSHIP IN MOVING IN OUR WORKING GROUP FORWARD TO COME UP WITH- THE LEGISLATION THAT NOT ONLY IS GOING TO ADDRESS HOUSING IN GENERAL HOUSING PRODUCTION IN GENERAL BUT THAT GIVES SPECIFIC IMPORTANCE TO THE CREATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO- HAVING BEEN INVOLVED- YEARS AGO WITH AB NINE HUNDRED. I WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE THE CREATIVITY OF THE PRO TEM IN TAKING THAT AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HELP ON THE HOUSING FRONT SO I. URGE SUPPORT. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. MADAM PRO TEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT ONLY TWO POINTS- WILL THREE I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES WHO'VE SPOKEN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE- AND YOU'RE A TENACIOUS NOUS ALONG WITH ME AS WE TRY TO GET THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION ACROSS. THE FINISH LINE AND FINALLY I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY NOW TO POINT OUT HOW IMPORTANT WAS THAT WE MAKE SURE THIS TOOL IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL PARTS OF OUR STATE NOT JUST THE LARGE METROPOLITAN AREAS LIKE THE CITY THAT I REPRESENT LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCISCO ALL PARTS OF THE STATE SO THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT. FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES GOOD PAYING JOBS AS WELL AS MUCH NEEDED SUPPLIES HOUSING I URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
