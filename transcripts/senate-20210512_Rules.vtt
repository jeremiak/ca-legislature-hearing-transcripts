THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE OR

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.533
REQUIRE PLANS TO CONDUCT A

PLANS HAVE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:28.274
OF PROVIDERS AND SO OUR REVIEW

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.075
REALLY IS. WHAT WILL BE THE

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.644
IMPACT OF THE PROVIDER

IF THIS CONTRACT TERMINATION

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:37.283
HAPPENS- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:38.584
SURE THAT WE REVIEW THE NOTICES

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:39.818
THAT GO TO CONSUMERS SO THAT

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.353
THERE IS CLEAR AS THEY POSSIBLY

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.856
CAN BE. BUT ALSO THAT CONSUMERS

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:46.091
ARE AWARE OF THE THEIR RIGHT TO

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.626
REQUEST CONTINUITY OF CARE TO

THEIR CURRENT PROVIDER IN YES

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:53.933
IT MEETS A CERTAIN CRITERIA- WE

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.401

THEMSELVES AND SOMETIMES SAYS

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.111
AFTER THAT THE NOTICES HAVE

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:08.647
GONE OUT TO CONSUMERS. IT CAN

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:09.181
CREATE CONFUSION AND

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:11.383
FRUSTRATION- AND THE UNKNOWN

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.185
OBVIOUSLY OF WHETHER OR NOT A

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:14.086
PARTICULAR PROVIDER WILL BE A

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:20.826

OPPORTUNITY YOU TO THINK ABOUT.

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:24.930
SOLUTIONS LEGISLATURE ON ON

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:26.232
SOME OF THOSE I KNOW WANT TO

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:27.933
SEE TO ONE WE TALK YESTERDAY OF

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.636
THIS SAME TO REQUIRE THAT SIX.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:31.637
RIGHT AT THE TIME OF AN OPEN

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.706
ENROLLMENT- BEFORE SO PEOPLE

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:34.940
WERE DISLOCATED THERE WERE

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:36.742
DISLOCATED A TIME OF OPEN

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:38.277
ENROLLMENT WHEN THEY COULD

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:39.511
CHOOSE TO DO IT RATHER THAN

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.280
JUST BE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:44.683
PERIOD AND EIGHT EVEN THOUGH

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.218
THERE MIGHT BE A REQUIREMENT

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:47.553
FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT'S

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.121
NOT SOMETHING THE HOSTAGES

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.657
USUALLY KNOW ABOUT IT. OR CLEAR

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.126
ABOUT SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:56.629
SOMETHING TO EXPLORE IS WHETHER

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.097
OR NOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:14:58.163 --> 00:14:59.531
PHASED IN OVER A NUMBER OF

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:02.401

BUT JUST TO SEE IF THERE IS A

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:14.179
SOLUTION THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:17.383

WITH US ON BECAUSE- I THINK

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.762
THAT WAS THE REALLY CRITICAL

00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:31.263
QUESTION YOU ASK ON ALL OF OUR

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.300
BY HOUSE AND I WOULD NOT HAVE

THOUGHT TO ASK IT SO- AT THIS

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:36.969
VERY RELEVANT TIME. SO

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:38.270
HOPEFULLY WE CAN PUT THAT ON

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:39.505
OUR TO DO LIST TO FIGURE OUT

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:41.140
HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THAT PROCESS

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:45.177

APPOINTMENT AND I'M LOOKING AT

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.161
YOUR BIO AND I'M THINKING

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:03.395
YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:04.496
FOR A WHILE AND IT'S A VERY

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.532
COMPLEX BUSINESS I COME FROM

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:08.067
COUNTY GOVERNMENT WE HAVE CAL

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.735
OPTIMA AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:10.502
EVER REALLY GOT MY HANDS

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:12.538
AROUND. THE HOW IT ALL WORKS

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:14.773
AND YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.742
NOT SOMETHING THAT TO US AS YOU

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:17.509
MENTIONED THAT YOU DON'T

00:16:17.576 --> 00:16:19.411
OVERSEE BUT CERTAINLY IT IS A

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:22.147
IT'S A BIG BIG COMPONENT OF THE

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:24.616
DELIVERY OF OUR- HEALTHCARE AND

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.118
ENSURING THAT CHAU CERTAINLY

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:28.754
OUGHT IN THE EQUITY ISSUE. THAT

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.422
TO OUR LOW INCOME AND

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:33.425
VULNERABLE. HAVE ACCESS WHICH

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.893
TAKES ME TO THE QUESTION O THE

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.163
HEALTH EQUITY AND I KNOW- THE-

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.498
BUDGET PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:41.367
BUDGET PROPOSAL ON HEALTHCARE

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:43.068
IS TO CREATE A NEW HEALTH

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:45.037
EQUITY AND QUALITY STANDARDS

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:50.676
FOR HEALTH PLANS TO MEET. AND

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:51.543
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT. YOU KNOW

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:52.311
FROM YOUR FIRST. SOME EXAMPLE

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:54.246
OF WHAT WOULD BE THE AND

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:56.782
QUALITY. THE MIGHT BE KIND. FOR

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.183
THESE NEW STANDARDS THAT YOU

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.686
ARE WELL VERSED ON GIVEN YOUR

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:03.055
BACKGROUND ON. WHETHER THERE'S

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.990
SUCH. A GREAT DIVIDE AT THE

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.992
MOMENT SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THE

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.293
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO LOOK AT

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.729
ALSO. SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT YOU

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:12.097
KNOW JUST GO TO THE IT'S KIND

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:14.833
OF A TWO PART. IF THEY'RE OF

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.536
THE POTENTIAL FOR. A COST

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.405
PRESSURE THAT COMES FROM. WHAT

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:22.474
SEEMS TO BE A NOBLE- EFFORT

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.343
THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BALANCE

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.211
THAT WITH THE COST BECAUSE THAT

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:28.046
PROBABLY IS A BIGGER ISSUE WITH

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:30.916
ACCESS- IN TERMS OF WHAT PLANS

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:33.152
OFFER SO. SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:34.219
WOULD BE GREAT AND I DO

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:36.121
APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING. I WAS

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:37.356
THINKING ABOUT THIS ALL WEEK

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.358
BUT MY SCHEDULE JUST CRIED.

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:40.759
REALLY COMPRESS THIS WEEK AND I

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:42.161
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GET TO

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.796
YOU OFF ON A ONE TO ONE THAT

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:45.531
TIME HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:47.099
YOU TO. SHARE WITH ME YOUR

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:51.270
THOUGHTS. ON ALL OF THAT.

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:53.071
JOURNALING AT I'VE BEEN WE CAN

00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:54.473
CHANCE TO MEET EITHER BUT WHAT

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.141
TO FUTURE UP. SO ON THE HEALTH

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.043
ACCORDING QUALITY PROPOSAL THAT

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.946
THE GOAL HERE REALLY IS TO. NOT

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.247
CREATE NEW MEASURES WE HAVE A

00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:03.315
LOT OF MEASURES THAT ARE

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:04.316
ALREADY CURRENTLY COLLECTED

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:05.851
ACROSS DIFFERENT PURCHASERS

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.386
WHETHER IT'S DH CS COVER

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:09.455
CALIFORNIA CALPERS WHICH I'M-

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:11.290
REALLY KIND OF HONE IN AND

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.225
REACH CONSENSUS AROUND TEN TO

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.927
TWELVE CORE MEASURES. THAT WE

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:17.095
CAN FOCUS ON AS A STATE TO

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:18.430
IMPROVE QUALITY BUT MORE

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:19.398
IMPORTANTLY HEALTH HEALTH

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:21.200
EQUITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.068
THAT WE'RE NOT. IMPROVING

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:27.239
UTILIZATION AND THAT HEARINGS

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:28.006
WITH- YOU KNOW. COMPL WITH

00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:29.174
CERTAIN SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AT

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:30.476
THE EXPENSE OF LEAVING BEHIND

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:31.810
OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:33.679
IN PARTICULAR ARE COMMUNITIES

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.681
OF COLOR- THE PANDEMIC IS

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:37.216
REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:38.684
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON OUR

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.252
ON OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LOW

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:42.054
INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND SO THE

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.455
GOAL IS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:44.890
WHICH MEASURE SHOULD WE FOCUS

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.059
ON. ON SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:49.294
WOULD BE THINGS LIKE DIABETES

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.830
HEART DISEASE- COLORECTAL

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:55.367
CANCER SCREENING. IMMUNIZATIONS

00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:56.802
AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME EGGS

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.470
AMPOULES WE REALLY WILL BE

00:18:58.537 --> 00:18:59.805
LOOKING TO THE COMMITTEE OF

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:02.274
EXPERTS TO ADVISE US. ON ALONG

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:03.575
WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS AND OF

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:05.244
COURSE THE LEGISLATURE WHAT

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.079
SHOULD THOSE MEASURES SPEED-

00:19:07.145 --> 00:19:08.447
AND THEN THE GOAL WOULD BE TO

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.215
SET BENCHMARKS OF WATER TO WE

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:12.417
WANT OUR PLANS TO GET WITH THE

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:14.086
FOCUS OF NOT LEAVING ANYBODY

00:19:14.152 --> 00:19:16.655
BEHIND- AND SO THAT WILL BE THE

00:19:16.722 --> 00:19:17.923
PROCESS THAT WE WILL GO THROUGH

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.458
TO RECEIVE. OVER SERIES OF

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:20.959
YEARS TO REALLY IDENTIFY THOSE

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.060
BENCHMARKS WITH THE ULTIMATE

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:23.862
GOAL. OF WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:26.598
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY- REALLY

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:27.666
BEING ABLE TO HOLD THE PLANS

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:29.334
ACCOUNTABLE TO ACHIEVING THOSE

00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:31.703
MEASURES. DESIGNEE CORRECTIVE

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.105
ACTION PLANS TO REALLY MOVE THE

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:34.406
NEEDLE ON THESE MEASURES AND

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:35.974
ULTIMATELY TAKING IN OUR

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:37.175
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS FINES

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:38.810
AND PENALTIES IF THEY DON'T

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:40.746
MEET THOSE BENCHMARKS. IN TERMS

00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:42.447
OF THE COST OF THE PLANS ARE

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.383
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING AS

00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:45.384
BUT IN THE SECOND PART OF OUR

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.185
MISSION B. SIDES ARE PROTECTING

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:48.687
HEALTHCARE- PROTECTING

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:49.588

ENSURING A STABLE HEALTHCARE

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:52.791
DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF. THE COST

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:53.825
OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:56.261
SOMETHING WE ARE ALWAYS VERY.

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:58.397
OF ALONG WITH THE IMPACT OF THE

00:19:58.463 --> 00:19:59.731
PROVIDERS BECAUSE THE PROVIDER

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.233
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CONSUMERS

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:07.239
REALLY HOW WE IMPROVE. QUALITY

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:08.273
I THINK THE COST WILL COME. IS

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.942
IT BORDER. ACHIEVE AND- ON SOME

00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:11.276
OF THESE MEASURES. AND TO REACH

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.244
MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT LEAVE

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:14.313
ANYBODY BEHIND. THERE WILL NEED

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:15.480
TO BE INTERVENTIONS AND SO THE

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:16.915
PLANTS WILL REALLY NEED TO

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:18.584
THINK CREATIVELY AND PROVIDERS

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.619
COLLECTIVELY ABOUT WHAT DO WE

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.788
NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE. ON

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:24.056
WHETHER IT'S GETTING PEOPLE IN

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:25.424
FOR VISITS MAKING SURE THEY'RE

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:26.858
COMPLYING WITH THEIR RATE THE

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:29.027
MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS- AND

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:30.896
ANYTHING ELSE REALLY TO IMPROVE

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:33.365
OVERALL QUALITY OF CARE- SO

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.633
THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE COST

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.901
WILL COME IN BUT IN THE LONG

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.203
TERM IF WE CAN ADDRESS-

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.038
PREVENTATIVE SERVICES AND LONG

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:41.106
TERM COMPLIANCE WITH SOMETHING

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:42.941
IS. REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURES I

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:45.410
THINK THAT'S WHERE WE CAN SEE

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:46.445
SOME COST SAVINGS IN THE FUTURE.

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:48.680

PART QUESTION. WE ALWAYS GO TO

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:55.587
THE REIMBURSABLE SAW FOR

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:57.389
PROVIDERS. AND THAT'S WHAT

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:58.991
SEEMS TO TAKE A HERE AT TWO IS

00:20:59.057 --> 00:21:01.326
WE GO FORWARD. THAT WE EXPAND

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:04.262
ACCESS BUT NOT PROVIDERS. AND

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:05.864
PROVIDERS TO DROP OUT BECAUSE

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.000
OF THE REIMBURSABLE ISSUE AND-

00:21:08.066 --> 00:21:09.167
FRANKLY THAT GOES BACK TO I

00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:10.035
THINK WHEN I WAS IN THE

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.903
ASSEMBLY AND- WE HAD MANY

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.538
PROVIDERS OUT SURROUNDING THE

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.140
CAPITAL AND- I DON'T THINK YOU

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:16.308
GUYS WERE ALL HERE AT THAT

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.543
POINT. DRIVE FOR LIKE TWO

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.111

YEAR THEY- WE GOT SOMETHING IN

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.451

THERE IS MORE MONEY AND I THINK

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:38.130
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:40.265

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:56.281
WHERE THOSE BARRIERS ARE AND

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:58.049
WHY IT'S JUST SO HARD TO GET

00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:00.885
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES- IT

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:02.220

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.937
SHOULD MARK. THE OTHER PIECE

00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:20.171
THAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON IS

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:22.207
SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE AND THE

00:27:22.273 --> 00:27:23.108
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WERE

GUIDELINES THAT ARE

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:34.786
TRANSPARENT- BUT THERE'S NOT A

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:36.154
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:38.289

WE PROTECTING CONSUMERS BUT WE

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:21.159

HEALTH CARE PLANS HAVING THE

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:42.280
OPTION TO OBTAIN

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:44.682
PHARMACEUTICALS ARE FROM

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:46.951
COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:50.655
STATES THIS HAS BEEN. A ROBUST

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:53.424
CONVERSATION THAT SO MANY

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:55.426
STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA I

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:58.129
HAVE BEEN HAVING. IN FACT LAST

00:29:58.196 --> 00:29:59.464
YEAR I THINK THE GOVERNOR WAS

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:00.798
INTERESTED IN FIGURING OUT A

00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:02.066
WAY THAT WE COULD GO AT IT

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:06.204
ALONE- BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:09.274
OF PHARMACEUTICALS. SO I WANTED

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.477
TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT-

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:15.780
GIVEN COST CONTAINMENT AS SUCH-

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:18.016
A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR SO MANY

00:30:18.082 --> 00:30:20.318
FOLKS IN THE HEALTHCARE.

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:23.855
INDUSTRY NOT SURE NON AND I

00:30:23.922 --> 00:30:25.657
THINK YOU KNOW AS AS AS A

00:30:25.723 --> 00:30:27.425
DEPARTMENT THAT'S VERY FOCUSED

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.260
ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS BUT

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:31.062
ALSO JUST CONTROLLING COST THE

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.497
COST OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:35.567
IT'S A VERY BIG ISSUE FOR US-

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:37.101
RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE A

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:38.536
VERY STRONG OPINION I CAN

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:39.437
STRESS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:41.272
ABOUT ACQUIRING PHARMACEUTICALS

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:42.774
OUT OF THE COUNTRY I YOU KNOW

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.575
I'D HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:44.442
FURTHER ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:45.743
THAT WOULD. WOULD HELP TO

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.011
CONTROL THE COST BUT I WOULD

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:48.112
SAY THAT ANYTHING THAT WOULD

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.280
HELP TO CONTROL THE COST FOR

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:51.549
CONSUMERS IS SOMETHING THAT- I

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:52.584
THINK WE ALL WOULD COLLECTIVELY

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.752
PEACE. ORDER BOB THE DEPARTMENT

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.554
HAS A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE WE

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:57.455
LOOK AT THE COST OF

00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:01.092
PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS EVERY YEAR-THE PLANT'S REPORT TO US ON THE

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:02.093
DRUGS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.596
COST HIGHEST INCREASING COSTS

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:06.431
IN THE HIGHEST UTILIZATION WE

00:31:06.497 --> 00:31:08.566
ALSO LOOK AT HOW THAT. IMPACTS

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:11.236
CONSUMER PREMIUMS AND SO WE'VE

00:31:11.302 --> 00:31:13.838
DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA

00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:15.974
WE ALSO CONVENED A TASK FORCE-

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.575
LAST OR NEXT IS BY TWO YEARS

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.577
AGO NOW AS A RESULT OF AB THREE

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:21.879
FIFTEEN- TO HAVE A TASK FORCE

00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:22.847
RECOMMEND ARE THERE OTHER

00:31:22.914 --> 00:31:23.915
THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:31:23.982 --> 00:31:25.416
LOOKING OUT AND SO I THINK THE

00:31:25.483 --> 00:31:27.785
MORE WE CAN BRING TRANSPARENCY

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:30.021
TO. THE FLOW OF THE MONEY-

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.256

NOT- PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:34.525
ARE WHAT THE ROLE THAT THEY

00:31:34.592 --> 00:31:35.660
PLAY IN THE VALUE THAT THEY

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.862
BRING SOUTH BEACH- I WOULD JUST

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:39.364
SAY WE ARE VERY SUPPORT OF ANY

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.898

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:42.700
COST OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS TO

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:47.105

OF MANAGING AND MONITORING-

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:02.053
OFFICE CLOSURES AND HOPING THAT

WE SAW A LOT OF THAT DURING

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:06.891
COLD BIT. AND I JUST WANT TO

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:08.826

LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WE SAW A

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:17.235
DOUBLE DIGIT- IN OFFICE

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:19.504
CLOSURES FOR SO MANY HEALTH

TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS HAVE

00:32:38.156 --> 00:32:40.291
ACCESS TO CARE ON THAT IS

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:41.693
AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY AND NON

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:44.896
DISCRIMINATORY. SO I KNOW THAT

EXPERIENCE WITH THIS THEN THE

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:07.037

PLEASE FEEL FREE- BUT WE DO

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:16.413

BIAS EVERYWHERE- INCLUDING IN

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:23.586
THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY- AND WE

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:24.788
ALSO KNOW THAT. THE

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:27.123
DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS- THAT HAVE

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.025
BEEN TAKEN HAVE BEEN-

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:31.161
DISPROPORTIONATELY AGAINST

BLACK IN LATIN X. PHYSICIANS-

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:36.700

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:39.335
THOUGHTS ON. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:43.006

BOTH SIDES. OF THAT EQUATION-

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:04.160
BUT I THINK IT ALSO SORT OF

00:56:04.227 --> 00:56:06.930
SUBTLY SPEAKS TO THE LACK OF

THESE SORTS OF THINGS OUT SO WE

00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:47.997
HAD TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF. THE

00:57:48.064 --> 00:57:49.065
SCOPE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.733

WHAT TWO THINGS THAT HAVE

HAPPENED. IS THAT AS A

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:01.778
CONSEQUENCE OF THESE FINDINGS-

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:03.913

TRAINING- IS PROVIDED TO. ALL

COMMISSIONS. GO THROUGH THIS SO

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:15.692
THIS IS VERY INFORMATIVE. FOUR

00:58:15.758 --> 00:58:17.760
THE MEMBERS. AS A RESULT OF

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:19.829
THE- RESULT OF THE STUDY. IN

00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:22.966
ADDITION. WE REDACTED.

00:58:23.032 --> 00:58:24.534
NONESSENTIAL INFORMATION THAT

00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:25.969
MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO BIAS FOR

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:27.303
EXAMPLE WHERE THE INDIVIDUALS

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:28.605
WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL WHERE

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:30.340
THE RESCU TRAINING. WOULD BE.

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:32.075
WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MAY SUB

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:33.810
CONSCIOUSLY OR CONSCIOUSLY.

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:35.678
BELIEVE THAT A PERSON WENT TO.

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:37.447
AN ELITE INSTITUTION. BUT I

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:38.481
CAN'T BE AS GOOD AS A

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:41.784
COMMUNITY. INSTITUTION AND SO

00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:42.919
THIS IS ONE OF THINGS WE ALSO

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.988
DID. SO THOSE TWO THINGS ARE

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:47.323
ACTUALLY BEEN. HELPFUL BUT IT

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:49.359
DOES NOT. GET RID OF. THE

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:54.063
PROBLEM OF BIAS SO MY

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.031
COLLEAGUES FEEL THAT- THIS PROM

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:58.735
IS TO RAISE- I THINK THIS IS

00:58:58.801 --> 00:59:00.670
GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO. DRILL

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:03.439
DOWN ON LOOKING AT THE NEXT

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:05.909
STEP THE NEXT PHASE AND TO

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:08.278
ACTUALLY CREATE A STUDY. THAT

00:59:08.344 --> 00:59:10.747
ANSWERS SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT

00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:12.215
NEED TO BE ANSWERED I THINK

00:59:12.282 --> 00:59:13.816
THAT SOME OF THE ONE OF THE

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:14.584
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.686
THE STAKEHOLDERS. THAT WE VIEW

00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:18.488
THIS AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:20.456
I DO I'M ONE OF THOSE. NEED TO

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.558

AND SPEAK OUT THEY NEED TO- GET

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:28.665
ON AGENDA. WE WILL. SET UP

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:29.732
MEETINGS WHERE THEY'LL BE THE

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:32.168
SUBJECT. OF DISCUSSION AND TALK

A NUMBER OF SOME COMMENTS THAT

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.838
YOU HAD MADE OUT OF SOME TIME

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:11.808
AGO. AS IT RELATES TO OUR

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:14.077

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:29.859

CONFUSION- I BELIEVE IN THE

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.598
EFFICACY OF VACCINES IT AND THE

YEARS AGO WE- WE HAD A BOARD

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.838
MEETING AND WE WERE TALKING

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:17.540

HISTORY OR ACTUAL THAT VACCINE

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:41.531
INJURY IN PATIENTS AND THAT WAS

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:44.067
REALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE MANY

CHILDREN WITH WITH VACCINE-

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:53.476
INJURY AND THEIR CONCERN AROUND

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.278
THAT ISSUE AND SO THAT AND

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:59.382
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT IT WAS- BUT

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.150
WITH RESPECT TO- HOW WE WOULD

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:04.187
LOOK AT IT FROM A BOARD- ABOUT.

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:07.056
VACCINES AND HOW I RELATES AT

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:09.325
IT TO PATIENTS IS THAT YOU

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:12.762
DON'T. WHEN IT WHEN AND IF IT

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:14.564
COMES BEFORE US WE ALSO HAVE A

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:17.066
DUTY TO LOOK AT THE LAW AND

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:18.835
WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT FOR

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.637

I WILL DIRECT THIS TO. MISTER

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:44.393
BROOKS AND MISS CAMP VERDE

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.028
RECOGNIZING THAT BOTH OF YOU

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:48.731

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:51.901
BOTH OF YOU SPOKE ABOUT-

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:55.238
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS- YOU BOTH

TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW BEING

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:01.110
MAYBE THE FIRST OR NOT SEEING

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.912
FOLKS THAT LOOK LIKE YOU AND

HISTORY IS WITH YOU ON TO THIS

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:09.552
BOARD- THE BOARD IS ALSO

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:12.321
CONTEMPLATING A FEE INCREASE-

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:14.090
SO WE HAVE A FEE INCREASE ON

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:15.892
THE ONE HAND. THAT'S BEING

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:20.630
PROPOSED. WITH OF MEDICAL BOARD

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:21.964
I THINK THAT'S RANKED.

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.966
ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:27.703
THIRTY THREE- IN THE NATION-

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.105
AND THAT HAS BEEN STRUGGLING

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:31.974
FINANCIALLY RIGHT WITH

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.544
OPERATING DEFICITS. COUPLED

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:37.847
WITH A VERY I GUESS ARE KEEN

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.115
SORT OF SYSTEM WHERE THE

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:40.716
MAJORITY OF THE MONEY AND THE

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.318
TIME IS ACTUALLY SPENT ON

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.854
INVESTIGATIONS- THAT MAYBE YOU

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:47.757
ALL DON'T HAVE- YOU KNOW YOU

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:50.393
YOU'RE NOT WITH HANDS ON WITH.

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:52.595
AND ALL OF THESE THINGS I THINK

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.931
ARE PART OF. THE COMPLEXITIES

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:57.433
OF BUILDING TRUST. WITH THE

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:01.237
PUBLIC. AND SO- WHILE I KNOW

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:02.371
THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:04.974
DISCUSSION ON THE FEE INCREASE

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.876
AND SOME FOLKS THINK THAT THINK

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:09.579
IT IS IMPORTANT JUST WANTED TO

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:11.681
KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS AND SORT OF

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:15.017
FRESH EYES TO THE BOARD- IN THE

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:16.652
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU WILL

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:19.222
HAVE AS BOARD MEMBERS. ON HOW

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:22.391
YOU WILL MANAGE THROUGH THOSE

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.760
COMPETING ISSUES RIGHT HOW TO

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.562
MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A BOARD

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:30.600
THAT IS A FISCALLY- MAYBE NOT

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.435
PRUDENT BUT AT LEAST MANAGING

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:35.605
COSTS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:39.942
FOR CALIFORNIANS. WITH LIMITING

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.444
THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:44.614
TAKES TO INVESTIGATE THESE

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:49.652
CASES. SO THAT PEOPLE FEEL LESS

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:52.021

pWANTING TO ENTER INTO THE FIELD

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.838

STREAMLINED OUR PROCESS AS FAR

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:30.446
AS INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE

HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.352
THERE'S A FEET USE WHICH WE

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:37.953
HAVE INCREASED OUR FEET IN

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:38.954
FIFTEEN YEARS BUT I AM

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:41.257
CERTAINLY MINDFUL OF THE FACT

THAT THESE COSTS ARE ARE ARE

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.094
BURDENS ESPECIALLY ON DOCTORS

COMPLICATED PROCESS AND WE

EXPLAINING IT. SO THAT. PEOPLE

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:26.469

WILLINGNESS TO SERVE ON THIS-

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:57.933
THE BOARD. AS I WANT TO GO BACK

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:58.834
TO THE ENFORCEMENT MODEL

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:01.904
HISTORICALLY USED- IT THE- THE

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:04.206
BOARD USED TO HAND OFF METHOD-

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:06.208
ENFORCEMENT MODEL SIMILAR TO.

01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:09.378
OTHER ENTITIES WITH AS THE DCA

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:11.180
DEBT YOU KNOW DEPUTY ATTORNEY-

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:14.183
BUT THE DCA- THE HANDOFF MODEL

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:17.386
WAS- ADJUSTED TO A VERTICAL

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:18.754
MODEL I BELIEVE IS WHAT IT WAS

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.189
CALLED. FOR VERTICAL

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.157
ENFORCEMENT MODEL IN TWO

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:24.927
THOUSAND AND FIVE- I THINK SB

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:25.694
TWO THIRTY ONE FIGARO WAS

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.596
REQUIRED THE BOARD TO IMPLEMENT

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.765
ALTERNATIVE MODELS TO. TO

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.767
MINIMIZE THE LENGTH OF TIME

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:32.868
INVESTIGATIONS WERE TAKING

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.703
PLACE I BELIEVE EVERYONE YOU

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.205
KNOW UP TO NINE HUNDRED DAYS

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:38.741
AND THE GOAL OF THE BOARD WAS

01:09:38.807 --> 01:09:39.308
FIVE HUNDRED FORTY DAYS TO

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:43.279
RESOLVE CASES. SO- YOU KNOW.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.714
WITH THE FAMILY- THAT HAD A

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:46.782
COMPLAINT OR A COMPLAINT WAS

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.717
ISSUED. AND THEY HAD TO WAIT

01:09:48.784 --> 01:09:50.686
THREE YEARS ON A DECISION- I

01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:54.723
THINK THAT'S WHERE. THE ISSUE

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:55.391
LIES WITH THE PUBLIC OPPOSITION.

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:57.059
IS THAT NOT HAVING THE PROCESS.

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:59.261
IN A MORE EXPEDITED FASHION BUT

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.796
I DO ALSO KNOW THAT THERE HAS

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:01.864
TO BE COMPLETE INVESTIGATIVE

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:05.067
PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:06.835
JUSTICE SYSTEM YOU KNOW JUSTICE

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:08.671
IS THERE. AND THE COMPLETE

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:09.872
INVESTIGATION THE TRUTH CAN BE

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:12.608
TOLD. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:15.611
THAT- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:16.745
I'M AND ADDRESSING IT TO DOCTOR

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.113
HAWKINS I GUESS BECAUSE HE'S

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.316
BEEN ON THE BOARD- BEORE OUR

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.918
ANY OTHER OF THE BOARD MEMBERS

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:23.485
THE DIRECTORS WOULD LIKE TO

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.754
READ A REPLY. AND THAT'S AS

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:28.324
WELL WELL I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.458
YOUR COMMENTS. FROM YOUR

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:30.793
PERSPECTIVE WHAT MEASURES IF

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.294
ANY CAN BE TAKEN TO STREAMLINE

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:33.596
OTHERWISE IMPROVE THE BOARD'S

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:34.964
ENFORCEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.866
AGAIN. WE ARE BACK WITH SENATOR

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:39.969
HILLS BILL SB SEVEN NINETY

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:43.639
EIGHT- THAT STOP THE VERTICAL-

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:46.208
ENFORCEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE-OBVIOUSLY IT ADDED TIME TO THE

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:49.745
INVESTIGATION. SO WHAT DID ANY

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.714
OF YOU SEE IN THE FUTURE TO

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.382
MAKE. AT A SOME MORE

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.717
STREAMLINED PROCESS IN THE

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.885
INVESTIGATION PROCESS. SO THAT

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:58.153
PEOPLE THAT HAVE ISSUES OR

01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.688
COMPLAINTS WITH THE BOARD WOULD

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:01.590
BE ABLE TO HAVE. RESOLUTION

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:05.194
QUICKER. I THINK ABOUT FAMILIES

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.695
THAT MAY HAVE HAD- AN

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:08.964
UNEXPECTED FATALITY LET'S JUST

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:10.466
SAY THAT AN UNEXPECTED TO

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:11.934
FATALITY OR AN UNEXPECTED

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.136
SITUATION. THAT CAUSED A MAJOR

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:15.938
MEDICAL ISSUE WITH A FAMILY

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.140
MEMBER OR LOVED ONE. AND THEY

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:19.541
CARRY THAT BURDEN AND THAT

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:21.377
FIGHT FOR THREE YEARS UNTIL THE

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:24.313
BOARD CAN RESOLVE- THE ISSUE SO

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.148
I GUESS MY CONCERN IS ON BEHALF

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.049
OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ALL

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.051
REPRESENT. IS THERE A

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.552
STREAMLINED PROCESS THAT ALL OF

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:35.024
YOU ARE- LOOKING AT. SO THAT.

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.491
IT CAN BE INVESTIGATED

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:38.160
THOROUGHLY. AND WE DON'T CUT

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:41.096
ANY CORNERS BUT THAT IT TAKES

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:42.765
LESS THAN THREE YEARS TO DO.

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.333
AND WHAT WE START WITH UGH AS

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.101
THE SENATOR INDICATED DR

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.936
HAWKINS AND THEN I WILL SEE WHO

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.204
ELSE WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THAT

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:51.206
IF THAT IS OKAYYES DOCTOR

VERY MUCH AND I WOULD. BUSINESS

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:57.446
SAY THAT THE NUMBER SO

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:58.647
SATISFIED WITH SOME OF THOSE

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.015
TIME LINES FOR THE MOST EXTREME

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:02.584
CASES SUMMER. CLOSE SOONER BUT

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.319
WE'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THREE

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:06.422
YEARS TAKES CLOSE A CASE. YOU

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:07.856

WHICH THE STATISTICS CAME FROM.

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:29.311
THERE WERE TOLD ABOUT THAT THE

PRIMITIVE- EXPERT. AND OF

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.063
COURSE THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.865
DISCUSSION INTO RECORDATION

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:39.034

INTO THE QUESTIONS IT'S

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:42.771
COMPLICATED. NO THIS IS NOT

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:44.740

RESPONSE. SO I THINK- YOU KNOW.

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:09.031
ONE THING. THAT WE RECOGNIZED

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:10.966
AS YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T WE WERE

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:12.834
USING VERTICAL ENFORCEMENT.

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:14.870
THAT WASN'T WORKING. WE STOPPED

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:16.838
DOING THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:19.775
THE PROCESS NOW. AND THAT'S- IN

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:22.177
A LONGER THAT'S TAKING LONGER

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.879
THE- LOOKING AT AT AT THE TIME

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:26.481
WINSTON BEFORE. SO WE'RE AT A

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:28.750
POINT THAT. THOSE TWO METHODS

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.719
AREN'T WORKING SO WHAT IS THE

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:33.355
NEW METHOD AND SO. I THINK WE

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.690
ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:37.359
THAT BROAD PERSPECTIVE. AND

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.895
THAT TAKES. YOU KNOW THE- THE

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:41.897
WORK OF ME THAT INVOLVES NOT

JUST THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT ALSO.

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:47.936
THE AG'S. AND NDC TO SEE WELL

IS THERE A NEW PROCESS THAT

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:52.374
COULD PERHAPS SPEED THINGS UP-

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:53.342
SO I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY TO

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:54.876
LOOK AT IT ALSO DOT AS DOCTOR

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.345

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:02.210
THAT MOST OF THE ISSUES WITH

THE MEDICAL BOARD ARE THE

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:05.814
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.115

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:24.499
THAT ARE THERE ARE THE COSTS

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:26.568
THAT WERE SHARED WITH US. FOUR

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.103
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:30.105
OPERATING ABOARD IN TWO

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:31.206
THOUSAND SIX SEVEN. IT IS

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:33.708
MUSHROOM TO FIFTEEN. AND A HALF

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.810

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:42.851
OF COST OF THE WORK THAT YOU

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.753
DO. BECAUSE DURING THAT SUNSET

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:46.421
REVIEW IT APPEARED TO BE THE

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:48.857
COSTS THAT. DO COME FORWARD THE

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.992
INVESTIGATION SAW. WITH THE

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.894
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THEY WILL

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:54.763
BE PROVIDING A FROM. FROM I

01:23:54.829 --> 01:23:56.498
THINK A PATH WHERE WE CAN FIND

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:58.299
A BALANCE HERE OF FOR ALL THE

01:23:58.366 --> 01:23:59.634
BOARDS BUT IN PARTICULAR THIS

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.569
ONE. BECAUSE I THINK THE GOALS

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:05.273
THAT YOU SET FORTH. IN YOUR

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:06.608

THOSE WHO COME BEFORE THE BOARD

WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS. SO I

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:16.885
THINK THE ONLY THING LEFT OF

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:18.119
THE QUESTIONS THAT I'M ALREADY

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:19.821
BEEN ANSWERED IN QUITE A JOB.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:21.689

CAN'T TRACK. OF THE PROGRESS OF

RUNNING BUT CLEAR CLEARLY THAT

01:24:42.043 --> 01:24:43.077

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:52.420
IT BECOMES AN OUTRAGE THAT. YOU

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.122

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:56.291

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:20.602
THAT THE COMPLAINING CAN

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.637
ACTUALLY TRACK WHERE. THE

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:24.305

LEVEL DOES NOT GIVE ENOUGH

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:46.227
DETAIL- BUT THAT'S CLOSELY

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:49.764

ABOUT YET- AND I DECIDED. SINCE

01:29:43.311 --> 01:29:44.445
IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT WHEN WE

01:29:44.512 --> 01:29:46.214
HAVE FOUR FIVE TOGETHER AND

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.882
EVERYBODY WANTS TO RESPOND THIS

01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:49.984
TIME I DECIDED BASED ON OUR

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.786
MEETING I WAS GONNA WRITE

01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:54.322

AND ASK YOU ABOUT IT FOLLOW UP

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.626
INDIVIDUALLY AND THUS FAR.

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:00.228
EVERY SINGLE ONE HAS BEEN

01:30:00.294 --> 01:30:02.697
ADDRESSED WHETHER IT'S- THE IT

WAS- MISTER BROOKS SAYING YOU

01:30:05.466 --> 01:30:05.900
CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU CAN'T

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:08.603
MEASURE- FOR- DOCTOR HAWKINS

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:10.404
NOT SATISFIED WITH THE BACKLOG

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:13.074
OF CASES AND SAYING. THE PUBLIC

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:16.010
IS TALKING BUT WERE NOT

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:18.179
RESPONDING FOR MISS CAR WILL BE

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.314
ON TALKING ABOUT TIME LINES.

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:21.749
AND I THOUGHT THAT JUST DO ONE

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:25.353
THING AND THAT IS THAT. THIS

01:30:25.419 --> 01:30:26.454
HEARING IS NOTABLY DIFFERENT

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:27.622
FROM THE OTHER ONE WE HAD ON

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:29.357
THE MEDICAL BOARD AND I HAVE

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:31.626
ASSESSED. THE THAT IS DUE TO

01:30:31.692 --> 01:30:32.927
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE MOSTLY

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:36.097
PUBLIC MEMBERS ED AND- OUR OF

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:38.566
REPRESENT THE PUBLIC. TO THE

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:41.369
BOARD IN A WAY THAT THAT IT

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:42.603
JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE LEVEL OF

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:44.071
INTENSITY THAT OUR PREVIOUS

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:45.907
HEARING AND SO THE ONE THING

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:50.545
IS. I WAS STRUCK BY A MIS COMPA

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:53.114
VERDES. PERSONAL STORY AND IT

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:56.217
CAME UP IN OUR A MEETING AND

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:58.352
YOU BROUGHT IT UP BRIEFLY. IN

01:30:58.419 --> 01:30:59.987
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT BUT YOU

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:01.823
EVEN PRODUCED A DOCUMENTARY

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:04.325
FILM CALLED INHERITANCE ABOUT

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:05.927
YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:07.995
YOU ALLUDED TO. AND I THOUGHT

01:31:08.062 --> 01:31:09.597
IT MIGHT BE REALLY IMPORTANT IN

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:11.065
MAKING THAT POINT ABOUT HOW

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:13.534
PUBLIC MEMBERS ARE INFORMED BY

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:15.937
THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE AND BRING

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.772
THAT TO THIS IN A DIFFERENT

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:20.675
WIFE THAT. THAT MAYBE YOU TALK

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:22.810
ABOUT. WHAT YOU DID IN THAT

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:25.646
FILM. S. N. AND YOUR PERSONAL

01:31:25.713 --> 01:31:27.782
EXPERIENCE AND HOW IT INFORMS

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:31.118
YOU BEING. ON THE MEDICAL BOARD

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:32.386
I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:31:32.453 --> 01:31:33.754
TO EVERYONE IF YOU WOULDN'T

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:37.258
MIND. I APPRECIATE THAT

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:41.229
QUESTION SENATOR AND- AND IT'S

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:42.263
SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT YOU

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.865
KNOW WE IT WOULD SERVICE TO

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:45.399
TALK ABOUT THAT AND THAT THE

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:47.268
PIECE OF IT AS MEMBERS OF THE

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:49.103
MEDICAL BOARD IN THE FILM THE

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:51.472
IDEA BEHIND IT AND IT KIND OF

01:31:51.539 --> 01:31:52.807
CAME TOGETHER AS I WAS GOING

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:54.508
THROUGH MY OWN SURGICAL JOURNEY

01:31:54.575 --> 01:31:56.611
THE IDEA BEHIND IT WAS TO

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:58.346
REALLY SHOW THE NEW WANTS TO

01:31:58.412 --> 01:31:59.780
THE REALITY OF WHAT IT LOOKS

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:01.849
LIKE TO TRY TO SAVE YOUR OWN

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:04.151
LIFE. AND A LOT OF WAYS THAT'S

01:32:04.218 --> 01:32:05.653
WHAT WE'RE ALL DOING WHEN WE

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.121
ENGAGE WITH THE MEDICAL SYSTEM

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.489
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO SAVE OUR

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.524
OWN LIVES WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:11.392
MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS WE

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:12.860
CAN'T AND ELONGATE OUR LIVES

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:14.795
AND THOSE OF OUR LOVED ONES AND

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:16.664
SO WATCHING WOMEN GO THROUGH

01:32:16.731 --> 01:32:19.033
THIS PROCESS IN MY FILM AND THE

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.035
HARD HARD CHOICES THEY'VE HAD

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:22.670
TO MAKE AND THE MODEL CHOICES

01:32:22.737 --> 01:32:24.405
THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE WAS

01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:25.539
SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:27.408
WHETHER IT'S ROCK ARE NO MATTER

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:28.876
WHAT. ILLNESS OR DISEASE

01:32:28.943 --> 01:32:30.244
SOMEONE HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.112
IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:33.681
UNIVERSALLY SHARE AND SO I

01:32:33.748 --> 01:32:36.250
BRING THAT PERSPECTIVE TO EVERY

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:37.685
CONVERSATION EVERY MEETING THAT

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.887
I HAVE AROUND THE MEDICAL BOARD

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:41.789
AND I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:44.025
AND I ARE TRYING TO PUT

01:32:44.091 --> 01:32:46.127
OURSELVES IN THE SHOES OF YOU

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:47.194
KNOW THESE AREN'T THIS CASE

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:48.729
NUMBERS THESE ARE JUST

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:50.798
COMPLAINTS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:51.832
HAVE BEEN HURT AND WHO ARE

01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:54.902
HURTING AND SO HOW CAN WE-

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:57.405
BRING THAT EMPATHY AND RESPECT.

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:58.873
TO THE WAY WE COMPORT OURSELVES

01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:01.976
AND ALWAYS HAVE THAT IDEA BE

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:03.711
THE GUIDING LIGHT OF THE BOARD

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:05.546
THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:08.282
CERTAINLY BUT THAT HAS TO BE AT

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:10.284
THE CORE OF WHAT WE DO IF YOU

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:15.589
ARE ABLE TO REALLY MAKE MEET.

01:33:15.656 --> 01:33:16.190

I WANT TO SET SOME CONTEXT-

01:33:41.048 --> 01:33:43.017
CONFIRMATIONS BY THE SENATE

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:45.019

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:47.188
WAY THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:49.657

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:25.860
COMMENT THAT MS COM LONGER

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:28.162
MADE- HER TECHNICAL TERM WAS

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:31.265
HOT MESS UP BUT I THINK. REALLY

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.534
HOW I WOULD REDIRECT THAT

01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:35.536
STATEMENT IS I LISTEN TO THE

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:37.638
SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS. AND IT

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:39.407
WAS CLEAR TO ME AFTER HAVING

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:40.541
HEARD FROM MEMBERS OF THE

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:42.009
PUBLIC WHO EXPRESSED THEIR

01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:45.546
CONCERN THAT THE BOARD WAS NOT

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:47.448
EXACTLY. FULLY ENGAGED IN THE

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:50.251
PUBLIC PROTECTION PIECE OF AND

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:51.952
THAT WAS THEIR CONCERN AND WE

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:53.888
HEARD THAT AT OUR LAST HEARING.

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:56.590
IT WAS UNCLEAR TO ME WHETHER

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:57.658
THROUGH THE ATTORNEY OF THE

01:34:57.725 --> 01:35:01.095
BOARD. THE EXECUTIVE OF THE

01:35:01.162 --> 01:35:04.031
BOARD. AND THERE WAS AT LEAST

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:05.933
ONE BOARD MEMBER MAYBE TO THAT

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.869
SPOKE THAT THERE'S ON CLARITY

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:11.372
IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS AND HOW

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:13.874
MANY CASES ARE HANDLED AND WHAT

01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:16.110
THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS ARE-

01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:18.579
AND THAT WAS REALLY TROUBLING

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:20.281
TO ME IN THE SHORT TIME THAT I

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:21.782
LISTENED MANNER VICE CHAIRWOMAN

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:23.851
YOU WERE ON THE COMMITTEE. AND

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:26.654
I JUST WANT TO SAY- I REMAIN

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.989
CONCERNED ABOUT THE INABILITY

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:32.726
OF- THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO GET

01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:35.496
A SENSE. OF THERE'S A LARGE

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.064
VOLUME OF CASES THAT'S VERY

01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:39.233
CLEAR TEN THOUSAND AND THEN YOU

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.669
AS MISS LUCIANO SAYS. YOU WANT

01:35:41.735 --> 01:35:43.070
TO YOU WANT IT YOU WANT TO

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:44.738
EFFICIENTLY AND QUICKLY DEAL

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:47.041
WITH THE MORE MINOR. NOT MINOR

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:48.676
IN THE MINDS OF PEOPLE WHO

01:35:48.742 --> 01:35:50.845
COMPLAIN BUT THE MORE- LESS

01:35:50.911 --> 01:35:52.746
EGREGIOUS SO THAT YOU CAN SPEND

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:54.315
THE TIME ON THE MORE DIFFICULT

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:58.352
CASES- WHAT WHAT CAME TO OUR

01:35:58.419 --> 01:35:59.954
ATTENTION AND WE REALLY HAVE NO

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.789
WAY TO GAUGE THIS AS

01:36:01.856 --> 01:36:04.058
LEGISLATORS IS THAT. WHEN

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:05.259
REVIEWING CASES THERE ARE

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:07.128
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH

01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:09.130
THE INFORMATION THAT OUR STAFF

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:09.763
HAVE PROVIDED US THAT THERE ARE

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:11.832
TWO PANELS. EACH OF YOU SERVE

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:13.901
ON ONE OF THOSE PANELS. TO

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:16.003
REVIEW CASES APPLY DISCIPLINARY

01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:18.405
GUIDELINES AND THAT THERE SEEM

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:19.773
TO BE SOME QUESTION AS TO

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:20.975
WHETHER THERE'S A DEVIATION

01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:23.944
FROM THOSE GUIDELINES- AND TO

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.212
THE AMOUNT OF ABILITY TO

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:27.781
DEVIATE GOD. THAT MAY BE GIVE

01:36:27.848 --> 01:36:32.953
LAW- PENALTIES- ON SOME OF THE

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.722
MORE EGREGIOUS CASES SO I

01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:35.923
REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:37.358
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I WAS

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:39.860
RESOLVED. IN LISTENING TO THE

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:42.730
SUNSET REVIEW HEARING- THAT

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.698
THERE WAS AGREEMENT AND YOU AS

01:36:44.765 --> 01:36:46.767
BOARD MEMBERS. I HAVE A

01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:48.235
RESPONSIBILITY TO I THINK

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:50.237
UNDERSTAND THOSE NUMBERS AND TO

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:54.141
UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:56.210
MEANS AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:58.779
THE PUBLIC WHO. MAYBE HAS LOST

01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:01.482
TRUST OR HAS SOME CONCERN. THAT

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:04.451
IS WHAT I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:09.190
ATTENTION. THAT CONCERNS ME- I

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:12.927
DO BELIEVE THAT- THAT THE VALUE

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:14.328
OF THE PUBLIC ROLE AND THE

01:37:14.395 --> 01:37:16.463
VALUE OF THE DOCTORS WHO SERVE

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.998
ON THIS BOARD ARE BOTH

01:37:18.065 --> 01:37:20.467
IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE I

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:22.503
BELIEVE IT IS THE TWO TOGETHER.

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:24.638
THAT REALLY PRODUCE THE PRODUCT

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:26.273
THAT CAN MAKE THE PUBLIC FEEL

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:29.343
COMFORTABLE- AND SO I THINK%

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:31.946
BOTH HAVE VALUE HAVEN'T KIND OF

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:34.748
SAID THAT STAGE THE BOARD HAS

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:36.083
TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF THE

01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:37.451
FEE INCREASE BECAUSE THERE IS

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.320
INSOLVENCY IS AN ISSUE THERE'S

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:41.121
THE COST FACTOR AND OBVIOUSLY

01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:42.690
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:45.492
COSTS THAT HAVE GONE UP THERE-

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:46.894
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU GET

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:49.997
TO CONTROL DIRECTLY. YOU HAVE

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:52.733
TO REACT TO IT- SO WITH THOSE

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.401
THINGS IN MIND THE THREE

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:56.437
PHYSICIANS THAT WE TALKED TO AT

01:37:56.503 --> 01:37:59.106
OUR LAST ARE. HEARING ALL WAIT

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:01.508
N. R. AND GAVE US

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.477
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO DEAL

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:05.613
WITH THE INSOLVENCY ISSUE. NOT

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:06.847
JUST IN TERMS OF THE FEE

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:08.649
INCREASE THAT MIGHT HAVE TO BE

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:10.017
CONSIDEREDAN AT WHAT LEVEL ON

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:12.319
THE BALANCE OF THAT DEBT.

01:38:12.386 --> 01:38:14.221
CENTER COME LONGER BROUGHT UP

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:17.291

RESPONSE TO US EACH OF THOSE

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:24.064
POSITIONS THAT COST RECOVERY

01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:25.332
WAS ALSO A FACTOR BEING

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:27.434
CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD. SO I

01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:28.936
WILL START WITH YOU- DOCTOR

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:30.404
