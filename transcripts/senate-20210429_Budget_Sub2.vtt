TRANSFORMING OUR UNDERSTANDING.

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:18.137
OF WHERE. THIS PROPOSAL NEEDS.

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:19.271
THERE AS A RESULT THAT GREAT

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.207

THE TRAILER PROPOSAL IN. ONE

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:25.478
BUT I DO TO HIGH JUST A COUPLE

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:29.315
THOSE- ONE WOULD BE THE

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.250
DECIDING. THAT THE

WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN THERE'S A

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.400
DIFFERENCE IN THE TIME AND THE

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:49.535
REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:36.321
THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:39.057
REVENUES- MATCH EXPENDITURES

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:41.226
THAT ARE APPROVED EACH YEAR IN

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:41.693
THE BUDGET ACT BY THE

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.030
LEGISLATURE. FOR THE ROLE THE

00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:45.797
TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:47.165
DEFICIT WITHIN THE TOXIC

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:48.800
SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT.

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.102
SIMILAR WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT

00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:51.036
THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A ONE

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:52.637
TIME GENERAL FUND OF THIRTEEN

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:54.406
MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR-

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:55.507
THIS WOULD KEEP THE FUND

00:22:55.574 --> 00:22:57.008
SOLVENT AND ALLOW DEPARTMENT

00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:59.544
CAN YOU ITS EXISTING

00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:00.612
PROGRAMMATIC EXPENDITURES.

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:01.513
HOWEVER FOR THIS ONE ARE

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.247
RECOMMENDING THAT THE

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:04.483
LEGISLATURE ADOPT A TAX PACKAGE

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:05.951
THAT RACES SUFFICIENT REVENUES

00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:08.353
TO PAY FOR DESIRED EXPENDITURES

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.087
THAT REFLECT LEGISLATIVE

00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:11.323
PRIORITIES. I'M SIMPLY WHAT IT

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:13.125
SHOULD BE SAFER TASK- THE

00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:14.659
MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:16.428
INCREASE THE TAX THAT SUPPORTS

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:18.697
THE ACCOUNT- SAYS SOLVE THE

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:20.332
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BUT ALSO FOR

00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:21.032
INCREASED PROGRAMMATIC

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:23.101
EXPENDITURES. HOWEVER WE FIND

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:25.437
THAT BECAUSE- TOSCA IS FUNDED

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:26.638
BY A BROAD BASED BUSINESS TAX

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.373
AND- FUNDS A VARIETY OF

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.474
DEPARTMENT ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:31.610
OF REGULATORY ACTIVITIES. WE

00:23:31.676 --> 00:23:32.878
THINK THAT THE EXPENDITURE AND

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:35.614
TAX INCREASE SHOULD REFLECT

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.616
LEGISLATIVE- PRIORITIES. AND WE

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:39.284
ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:40.685
ULTIMATELY WE RECOMMEND THAT

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.621
THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. AT

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:43.855
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:45.223
ALLOW THE NEW BOARD SUGGESTS

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.425
THAT TAX IN FUTURE YEARS. THIS

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:49.494
WOULD ENSURE THAT REVENUES-

00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:50.729
MATCH EXPENDITURES THAT

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:53.665
APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:55.834
IN EACH BUDGET ACT- ONE

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.769
THINKING ABOUT THE TAX INCREASE

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:59.771
FOR TOSCA TO ENSURE THAT. I'M

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:01.773
SUFFICIENT REVENUES ARM ARM

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.309
CREATED TO MEET LEGISLATIVE-

00:24:04.376 --> 00:24:06.478
PRIORITIES FOR EXPENDITURES- WE

00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:09.080
pSHOULD ALSO REFLECT LEGISLATIVE

00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:10.916
PRIORITIES. THE FIGURE ON THE

00:24:10.982 --> 00:24:12.851
LEFT INDICATES THE LEGISLATURE

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:13.652
AREN'T THEY MINISTRATIONS

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:16.254
PROPOSAL. AS YOU CAN SEE-

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:17.789
SMALLER BUSINESSES WOULD NOW BE

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:19.591
EXEMPT FROM PAYING THE TAX.

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:21.326
MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES WOULD

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:22.994
ESSENTIALLY BE PAYING THE SAME

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:24.563
AMOUNT IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.464
THREE. AND MOST OF THE INCREASE

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:27.666
WOULD BE PLACED ON LARGER

00:24:27.732 --> 00:24:29.701
BUSINESSES. I'M IN THE

00:24:29.768 --> 00:24:31.303
MINISTRATION AS INDICATED THAT

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:32.671
THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE LARGELY

00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:34.973
BECAUSE OF OUR IN RESPONSE THE

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.475
PANDEMIC. IN OUR ANALYSIS WE

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:40.045
PROVIDE TO- OVERARCHING POLICY

00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:41.112
QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.881
WHEN CONSIDERING THIS INCREASE.

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:44.216
THE FIRST BEING AS IF AND

00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:46.551
DEMOCRAT LATED RELIEF MEASURES-

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:48.253
SHOULD BE INCLUDED. WE FIND

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.487
THAT THIS APPROACH ISN'T THE

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:51.957
MOST TARGETED WAY TO- ADDRESS

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:52.657
IMPACTS RELATED TO THE

00:24:52.724 --> 00:24:54.960
PANDEMIC. WE FIND THAT THE SIZE

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:56.828
OF BUSINESS WON'T NECESSARILY

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.730
RELATE TO NEED IT'S GOING TO

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:00.799
VERY INDUSTRY TO INDUSTRY-

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:02.067
HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE WHERE

00:25:02.133 --> 00:25:04.402
TO FIND THAT- TAX INCREASE IN

00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:06.171
STRUCTURE SUCH AS THIS WERE

00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:08.707
REFLECTED ITS PRIORITIES- A

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:10.442
SECOND QUESTION WE RAISES.

00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:11.476
WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE A

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:17.349
MECHANISM IN THE FUTURE- TO

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:19.284
BRING IN. TO REMOVE EXAMS

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.986
BECAUSE THE EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:21.920
CURRENTLY PUT FORWARD WOULD BE

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:23.588
PERMANENT. SO HAVING A

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:25.023
MECHANISM IN PLACE FOR WHEN THE

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.291
STATE HAS ENTERED ECONOMIC

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.393
RECOVERY- TO REVIEW THESE AND

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.594
BRING THESE BUSINESSES BACK

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:31.730
INTO PAYING THE TAX. WELL WHAT

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:33.565
DO YOU ALSO THINK ABOUT THERE'S

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:35.166
A LOT OF. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:36.701
YOU'RE PICKING UP A BIGGER FEE

00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:39.404
FROM PEOPLE AT A COST OUT FOR

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:40.205
THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT YOU

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.307
HAVE TO DO A ONE OF THE- ISSUES

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:43.808
IT'S RACES THAT THE SMALLER.

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:46.244
BUSINESSES IT IT SPEND MORE

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:47.979
TIME AND MORE MONEY CHASING

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:49.848
DOWN THE FEE THEN IT'S THEN IT

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:53.184
THEN IT ACTUALLY BRINGS INTO.

00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:54.920
BRINGS INTO THE FUN- YEAH THAT

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.588
THAT'S THAT'S AN ARGUMENT AND I

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:57.689
GUESS YOU KNOW EVERYBODY HAS

00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:58.957
THEIR OWN IDEA OF WHAT A SMALL

00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:00.458
BUSINESSES BUT- ID ONE

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:02.460
DEFINITION IS LESS THAN A

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:03.929
HUNDRED PEOPLE SO THAT. SEEMS

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:06.631
TO BE. THE MILLION DOLLARS THAT

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:08.266
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:12.203
THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES BETWEEN

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.038
FIFTY AND NINETY NINE IS THAT.

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:13.972
WHAT IT WOULD HAVE TO SAY ABOUT

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:16.141
BUT- THAT I MEAN I KNOW THAT

00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:17.442
ARGUMENT IS FOR THE PEOPLE

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:20.312
UNDER FIFTY TWO SMALL. SPECIFIC

00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:21.179
UP IT IS IT IS IT WORTH OUR

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:24.582
TIME. WE'RE DOING THIS REFORM-

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:25.884
IN SPEAKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:27.452
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY INFORMATION

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:29.888
TO INDICATE THAT- EXEMPTING

00:26:29.955 --> 00:26:33.124
THESE BUSINESSES WOULD PROVIDE-

00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:35.093
SAVINGS AND THAT ESSENTIALLY WE

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.695
WOULD BE. PAYING MORE TO

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:37.896
COLLECT THAN REVENUES WOULD BE

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:39.898
BROUGHT IN SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:41.232
ANYTHING ELSE BEGIN DEPARTMENT

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:43.001
IN TERMS OF WHETHER. IT'S WORTH

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:45.203
IT TO EXEMPT AND CONTINUE TO

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.839
EXAM SO- THAT WOULD BE MY

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:50.175
RESPONSE AND WHETHER. ACCEPTING

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:51.409
THESE BUSINESSES IS WORTH THE

00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:53.011
STATE'S- EFFORTS IN TRYING TO

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:54.779
COLLECT RIGHT NOW AND I GUESS

00:26:54.846 --> 00:26:56.948
IF IT IF WE JUST. ARGUMENTATIVE

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:58.383
POLICE SAY WE ACCEPT THE

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.951
PANDEMIC AFFECTING PEOPLE

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:00.919
TRYING TO GET ON THEIR FEET AND

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:05.957
ALL THAT. WOULD BE S. EXEMPTION

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:07.425
THAT YOU WOULD SAY- AND ENDED

00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:09.194
SUNSETS IN FIVE YEARS OR

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.195
WHATEVER WHATEVER WHENEVER WE

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.563
THINK PEOPLE ARE BACK ON THEIR

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:14.632
FEET. SO THAT THE- THE BOARD

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:15.734
COULD DETERMINE IF THEY WANTED

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.602
TO EXTEND IT BECAUSE IT IS A

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:19.204
TWO THIRDS VOTE SO YOU. IF YOU

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.939
SAY NO FOREVER THAT IS NO

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:22.807
FOREVER RIGHT OR YOU KNOW THE

00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:25.677
TWO THIRDS VOTE OKAY. PROCEED

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:27.612
I'VE AND THEN WHAT THE RAMPAL

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:29.881
PLAN A PROPOSAL- WE BELIEVE

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:31.082
THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:32.450
CONSIDER THE MERITS OF THIS

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:33.818
PROPOSAL INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:36.254
OTHER THREE COMPONENTS- THE

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:37.856
ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED

00:27:37.922 --> 00:27:39.991
THAT THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:41.292
BROWNFIELDS PROPOSAL IS

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:43.328
CONTINGENT ON THE OTHER THREE

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:43.762
WE DON'T BELIEVE THE

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:44.763
LEGISLATURE SHOULD THINK IN

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:47.132
THESE TERMS- IF IT'S PART OF

00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:48.633
ITS GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES TO

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.701
APPROPRIATE FUNDS FOR

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:51.169
BROWNFIELDS CLEANUPS IT SHOULD

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:53.038
AND NOT THINK ABOUT THE OTHER

00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:55.173
THREE COMPONENTS- HOWEVER

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.007
OVERALL WE FIND THAT THE

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.243
BROWNFIELDS PROPOSAL- DOES HAVE

00:27:58.309 --> 00:27:59.744
A LOT OF MERIT. I'M GETTING

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:01.813
MONEY FOR BROWNFIELDS CAN-

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.049
REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL RISK AND

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:05.316
HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:08.887
CONTAMINATION- IT CAN ALSO SPUR

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:09.788
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:10.455
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDER

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.624
INVESTED- BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.892
POLICY QUESTIONS AND

00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:15.260
IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS THE

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:16.594
FIRST TWO FORWARDS ARE LARGER

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:18.363
POLICY QUESTIONS THE FIRST

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.432
BEING IS WHAT IS- THE INTENDED

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:22.967
GOAL WHAT GOAL IS THE HIGHEST

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:25.637
INTENDED- PRIORITY FOR FUNDING

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.472
AND WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.074
HAS TWO MAIN PRIORITIES IT'S

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.009
THE SPUR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

00:28:31.076 --> 00:28:32.077
AND ALSO TO ADDRESS

00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:33.711
CONTAMINATION THE LEGISLATURE

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:35.847
MAY WANT TO IDENTIFY. A PRIMARY

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:38.149
GOAL SO FUNDS ARE TARGETED AND

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.751
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTRACT

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:42.287
HOW WE'RE MEETING THESE GOALS-

00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:44.355
FOR THE GRANT PRO- COMPONENT OF

00:28:44.422 --> 00:28:46.724
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ONE INSURE

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:47.158
THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:48.827
UNDERSTANDS THAT HOW THIS

00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:49.894
FUNDING COMPLEMENTS OTHER

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:51.196
HOUSING PROPOSALS WITHIN THE

00:28:51.262 --> 00:28:52.797
BUDGET ACT AND IT SUPPORTS THEM

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:54.432
AS WELL- THERE'S NUMEROUS

00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:55.733
HOUSING PROPOSALS BUT THEN THE

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.102
BUDGETS WOULD WANT INSURE THAT

00:28:57.168 --> 00:28:58.336
THIS GRANT COMPONENT I'M

00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.672
COMPLIMENTS THEM AND ENSURES

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:01.639
THAT THERE'S NO DUPLICATION AS

LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES AND

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:07.812
THEN FOR IMPLEMENTATION

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:10.148
QUESTIONS GO TO THE BOTTOM TWO-

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:11.683

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.706
DOES NEED TO RAMP UP TRAINING

00:29:34.772 --> 00:29:37.041
FOR THOSE WHO. WORK IN THESE

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:37.976

SPEAKER THEY GET ON THESE

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:19.464
BOARDS. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.899
THIS IS A VERY TECHNICAL BOARD

THAT'S DOING OVERSIGHT OF THE-

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.803
TOXICS PROGRAM THIS IS NOT.

YOU KNOW WHAT WE- THE PEOPLE

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:31.476
WANT TO SERVE ON THE BOARD

IT'S- IT'S A LIMITED GROUP OF

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:37.014
PEOPLE. OTHER THAN WE THINK

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:38.282
IT'S NICE WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:40.451

YOU KNOW A POWER TRIP. I'M I

THINK IN RESPONSE TO THE THAT'S

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:51.095
THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:52.930
REPORTING- WE FIND THAT IN THE

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.298
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:55.733
THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR THE

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.168
NEW BOARD TO REPORT TO THE

00:33:57.235 --> 00:34:00.138
SECRETARY OF COUNTY PA- WE

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.472
THINK THAT REPORTING A CRIME IS

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:02.740
GOOD AND NEEDED BUT- AT THE

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:03.875
SAME TIME TO INCREASE

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:05.410
LEGISLATIVE ORDER OVERSIGHT

00:34:05.476 --> 00:34:07.612
THAT THIS- REPORT SHOULD ALSO

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:09.480
BE SENT TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:12.417
CAN BE REVIEWED BY THEM- AND AT

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:13.618
THE SAME TIME THAT IT SENT TO

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:16.087
BOTH EQUALLY- IN RESPONSE TO

00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:17.722
THE SECOND COMMENT YOU MADE

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:20.158
ABOUT- APPOINTMENTS- WE THINK

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:21.659
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAVING THE

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.961
ABILITY TO. APPOINT ITS OWN

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:26.564
MEMBERS AND ALSO HAVE THE

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:27.565
APPOINTED BY MEMBERS GOT THEIR

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:29.267
SENATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS.

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:30.902
IT'S JUST ANOTHER AVENUE FOR

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.136
THE LEGISLATURE DEPRIVE PROVIDE

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.471
OVERSIGHT. AND NO

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.006
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:36.741
HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:37.642
FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:39.911
OF. ESTABLISHING THIS BOARD AND

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:41.078
FOR THE JUST THE GREATER REFORM

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:43.614
OF PTSD. SO HAVING THOSE

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:44.215
APPOINTED BOARD MEMBERS WOULD

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:45.983
HAVE THE LEGISLATURE ANOTHER

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.085
OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ITS

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:49.320
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:50.655
THE DEPARTMENT BY ENSURING

00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:51.722
THAT. THE BOARD MEMBERS THAT

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:55.860
ARE IMPORTANT NOT ONLY REFLECT

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:56.994
THE GOVERNOR'S- USE AS WELL BUT

00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:58.830
ALL LET. ISSUES ON ON HOW THE

00:34:58.896 --> 00:34:59.831
BOARD SHOULD BE AROUND AND WE

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:01.332
FEEL THAT. A SECOND WHERE

00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:02.834
MEMBERS A BIG PROCESS OF THAT

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.903
RIGHT. I GUESS THE CONCERN THAT

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.773
I HAVE IS THAT. I WANT I WANT

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.241

AND THE CITED THEY CLEANED UP.

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.716

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:19.617
THEY'VE COME IN AND SAY WE

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:38.089
BECAUSE NOT ALL SITES ARE NOT

00:37:38.155 --> 00:37:39.657

WANT TO SEE IN THIS AND THERE

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:02.580
BEEN A RANGE OF THINGS PEOPLE

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:04.882
WANT PARKS PEOPLE WANT TO YOU

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:05.383
KNOW A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:07.585
FUNCTIONS SO FIGURING OUT THE

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:10.755
APPROPRIATE CLEAN UP- STANDARD

00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:12.289
TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SAFETY IS

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:14.425
GOING TO BE CRITICAL CROSS THE

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:15.593
BORDER NO MATTER NO MATTER

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.964
WHAT. THE CASE AND OF COURSE.

WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:22.500
TO A ADVANTAGE OF ECONOMIES OF

00:38:22.566 --> 00:38:24.035
SCALE THERE COULD BE CASES

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:26.037
WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.905
CONTAMINATED SITES THAT. IN IN

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:29.707
A GENERAL AREA AND WE MAY WANT

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:30.541
TO FOCUS ON THOSE AND THAT

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:32.510
COULD MAYBE DRIVE UP THE COST

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:34.178
FOR ONE PARTICULAR SITE. OR

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:35.312
MAYBE THERE'S ONE THAT HAS MORE

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:36.781
CONTAMINATION AND MAKES THINGS

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.082
MORE COMPLEX BUT THE OVERALL

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.751
BENEFIT- OF DOING THAT KIND OF

00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:42.920
COORDINATION COULD LEAD TO MUCH

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:48.492
BETTER OUTCOMES. FRANCESCA'S

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:50.027
SURE I AM I THINK THINK YOU THE

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:51.262
QUESTION BY JUST TO ADD THAT WE

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:53.931
HAVE PART REGARD. WITH AND

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:54.732
HOUSING AND COMMUNITY

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:57.134
DEVELOPMENT SURE THAT WERE-

00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:59.036
WILL BE WORKING WE ARE HAVE

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:00.404
BEEN AND WILL BE BANNED PARTY

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:02.306
WITH THEM CLOSELY TO IDENTIFY

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:03.808
THOSE AREAS WITH HIGH HOUSING

00:39:03.874 --> 00:39:06.577
NEEDS- AND- AND THOSE

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:08.479
VULNERABLE COMMUNITY SAID. THAT

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:10.381
THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IS IN THE

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:12.283
TOP 25% OF THEM VIRUS SCREEN

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:15.519
SO. AND THERE IS A FOCUSED- YOU

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:17.321
KNOW THERE'S IT ACCORDED EFFORT

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:19.123
TO FOCUS ON ON THESE AREAS FOR

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.992
THE BROWNFIELD SITES- EXISTING

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:24.261
ON AND THEN TO EXACTLY WHAT.

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:26.597
THE DOCTOR SAID WHICH IS TO USE

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:28.165
A CONDOM USE OF SCALE AND USE

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:29.400
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SOME OF

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:30.735
THESE SITES AND WE HAVE SOME

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.203
ORPHAN SITES WHERE WE ALREADY

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.504
HAVE BEEN IN PROGRESS YOU WILL

THE FINISH LINE WITH SOME OF

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:39.777
THE SPENDING- SO. I THINK IT'S-

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:42.279
IT'S A COMPLICATED- PROJECT TO

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:44.749
BE SURE- AND COORDINATION WILL

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:47.017
BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:47.818
WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THAT

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.420
PROCESS. YEAH BECAUSE I THINK

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:51.255

OF CLEANLINESS AND IN ONE OF

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:01.866
THE THINGS IS THAT IT SEEMS TO

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:03.334
US IS THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.935
TO GET IT SO THAT IT'S SAFE

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:05.803
WHETHER IT'S SAFE ENOUGH TO

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.538
BUILD HOUSING ON IT. OR SAFE

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:09.507
ENOUGH FOR A DEPARTMENT STORE

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:10.775
IF WE EVER BILL THE DEPARTMENT

HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONLY GO

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:07.731

MONEY FOR THE PUBLIC OUT THERE

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:10.835

00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:11.641
ADDITIONAL GROUNDWATER PUMPING-

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:14.478
CAUSING SIGNIFICANT LANDSLIDES

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:16.079
AFFECTING SOME OF OUR WATER

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:19.483
SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALSO-

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:20.851
CAUSING A LOT OF WATER RIGHTS

00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:22.819
ADMINISTRATION CHALLENGES FOR

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:24.020
OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:25.822
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:29.659
BECAUSE NATURAL FLOWS. WERE SO

00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:32.229
LOW AT THE TIME. SO WE LOOK AT

00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:34.664
AS DIRECTED IN THE LEGISLATION

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:37.734
THE NUMBER OF- AREAS THAT WERE

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:40.137
AFFECTED BY THE DROUGHT AND

00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:42.806
SOME OF THE THINGS. WE DID

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:44.274
DURING THIS DROUGHT REFLECTING

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:46.743
THE MAJOR FUNDING PROVIDED BY

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.112
THE LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND TO

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:51.114
DROUGHT CONDITIONS THIS WAS THE

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:52.482
SECOND TIME THAT WE HAD A

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:54.484
STATEWIDE PROCLAMATION OF

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:57.187
DROUGHT EMERGENCY. AND ALSO THE

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:58.855
VERY FIRST TIME THAT THE STATE

00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:01.057
REQUIRED MANDATORY URBAN WATER

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:03.560
USE REDUCTIONS ALSO THE FIRST

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:05.195
TIME THAT WE HAD WIDESPREAD

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:06.797
STATE ASSISTANCE FOR SOCIAL

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:09.232
SERVICES IMPACTS RELATED TO

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:10.600
DROUGHT ESPECIALLY THOSE

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:12.302
RELATING FROM THE LOSS OF

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:14.871
AGRICULTURAL JOBS. IN THE US

00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:17.007
CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE IMPACT

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.875
OF THAT ON COMMUNITIES THAT

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:21.711
WERE VERY DEPENDENT ON

00:51:21.778 --> 00:51:24.314
AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT. SO I

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:26.283
AS IS NORMAL WHEN WE HAVE MULTI

00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:28.452
YEAR DROUGHTS WE SEE RESPONSE

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:29.786
ACTIONS ONE THE VERY

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:31.721
SIGNIFICANT ONES IN THE LAST

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:33.857
ROUTE WAS THE ENACTMENT OF THE

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:34.825
SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:37.093
MANAGEMENT ACT OR SIGMA WHICH

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.030
REQUIRES. THAT LOCAL AGENCIES

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:42.566
BRING GROUNDWATER BASINS INTO

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:44.734
LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:46.703
CONDITIONS AS WELL AS NEW

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.371
REQUIREMENTS FOR WATER

00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:51.775
CONSERVATION AND IMPORTANTLY

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:52.943
BEGINNING TO ADDRESS SOME OF

00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:55.111
THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:57.514
SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. AND DATA

00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:58.949
COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON

00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:02.152
PRIVATE WELLS WHO ARE AFFECTED

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:03.920
EARLIEST AND NORMALLY TO THE

00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:06.389
GREATEST EXTENT BY DROUGHT OUR

00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:08.525
LARGE URBAN WATER PURVEYORS-

00:52:08.592 --> 00:52:10.193
TEND TO HAVE THE RESOURCES AND

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.497
THE CAPACITY TO DO- WELL AND

00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:14.331
PREPARE FOR MULTI YEAR

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:17.467
DROUGHTS. THAT IS NOT THE SAME

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:19.736
THING FOR THE SMALL SYSTEM

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.038
WORLD AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:23.607
STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:26.810
BOARD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:27.811
SOME OF THE- YOU PROVISIONS

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:30.113
PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.515
DEAL WITH THAT INCLUDING THE

00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:33.250
FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH THE

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:36.219
SAFER. ACT AND THE USE OF

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:37.787
MANDATORY CONSOLIDATION

00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:40.724
AUTHORITY TO CONNECT US

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:43.693
STRUGGLING SMALL SYSTEMS OR

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.595
GROUPS OF DISADVANTAGED JOB

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:48.131
PRIVATE WELL OWNERS FOR EXAMPLE

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.933
TO PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. ARE

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.368
SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT WE

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:55.872
LEARNED IN THE LAST DROUGHT.

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:57.440
BIG LESSON WAS TO BEGIN TO SOON

00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:59.509
IN IS SLOW A CONDITION AS

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:00.544
COMPARED TO THINGS LIKE

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.812
EARTHQUAKES OR WILDFIRES AND IT

00:53:02.879 --> 00:53:04.514
PROVIDES A LONG LEAD TIME FOR

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:06.383
STATE THE AGENCY RESPONSE

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:08.919
ACTIONS THESE ACTIONS TEND TO

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:11.221
TAKE TIME BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.156
THINGS LIKE- CONTRACTING FOR

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:15.425
RESOURCES PROVIDING FINANCIAL

00:53:15.492 --> 00:53:16.159
ASSISTANCE COULD TO

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:18.461
COMMUNITIES. ON DOING THE LONG

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:19.863
TERM PLANNING TO ADMINISTER

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.965
WATER RIGHTS THOSE KINDS OF

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:25.068
THINGS AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED A

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.269
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE ARE

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:28.371
ALREADY PUTTING INTO PRACTICE

00:53:28.438 --> 00:53:30.073
AS WE LOOK AT THE DRY

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.775
CONDITIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING

00:53:31.841 --> 00:53:34.711
NOW. SO CERTAINLY THE WATER

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:37.113
RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO SPEAKS TO

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:40.350
THE ART LONG TERM IMPROVEMENT

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:42.752
ACTIVITIES FOR- WATER SUPPLY

00:53:42.819 --> 00:53:44.454
AND DROUGHT RESILIENCE

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:47.090
CONDITIONS ALSO TALKING ABOUT

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:48.858
THE PROGRESS IN OTHER AREAS

00:53:48.925 --> 00:53:51.895
SUCH AS- UP REPAIRED MISSED FOR

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:54.965
WILDFIRE AND LOOKING AT THINGS

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:57.000
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:59.636
WILDLIFE HE CAN DO TO BETTER BE

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:01.071
PREPARED TO HELP WITH THE

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:05.041
ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. SO-

00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:06.676
AMONG OUR MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:10.580
FROM INVESTING IN IMPROVING OUR

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:11.748
DATA INPUT AND FORECASTING

00:54:11.815 --> 00:54:15.251
INFRASTRUCTURE. ONE OF THE-

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:16.786
LESSONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:19.155
PRIOR DROUGHTS IS THIS ISSUE OF

00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:22.258
FUN. THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:24.394
LONGER LEAD TIME TO RESPOND AND

00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:26.596
YOU GET THAT LONGER LEAD TIME

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:29.032
BY IMPROVING FORECASTING. ALSO

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:31.101
MAKING ADVANCE- MAKING

00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:33.036
IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR OUTREACH

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:35.772
COMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITIES AND

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:36.673
IMPORTANTLY SOME OF THE WORK

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.075
THAT CAL FIRE HAS DONE IN

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:39.876
PARTNERING WITH THE FEDERAL

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:42.312
GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS FOREST

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.648
MANAGEMENT CONDITIONS. ON NOW

00:54:44.714 --> 00:54:46.216
THE FEDERAL LANDS WHICH MAKE UP

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:48.418
SO MUCH OF OUR WATERSHEDS IN

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:50.754
CALIFORNIA. SO WHERE ARE WE

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.489
TODAY WELL I HATE TO SAY IT'S

00:54:52.555 --> 00:54:54.057
LOOKING LIKE DEJA VU ALL OVER

AGAIN BUT WE ARE HAVING VERY

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:58.995
DRY CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW. THE

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:17.881
IS PURSE.

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:39.903
OF AVERAGE. SO WE ARE

00:55:39.969 --> 00:55:42.338
YOU KNOW EXPECTING TO SEE SOME

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:44.908
SIMILAR CONDITIONS AS WE

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:48.011
EXPERIENCED THEM. AND IN TERMS

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:49.612

WE HAD IDENTIFIED AS THE THINGS

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:59.422
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:01.658

OF DRINKING WATER I JUST WANTED

00:56:38.495 --> 00:56:39.662
TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE EARLY

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:42.532
ACTIONS WERE TAKING- TO TRY TO

GET A HANDLE ON WORKING WATER

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.769
SYSTEMS ARE AT. AS A MISS JONES

00:56:45.835 --> 00:56:47.537
MENTIONED IT REALLY IS-

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:49.506
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT

LEAST ABLE TO TAKE THIS- IMPACT

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.248
ON ON TOP OF A- COVERED

00:56:58.314 --> 00:57:00.250
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS- WE ARE

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:01.217
CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THEY

00:57:01.284 --> 00:57:03.753
PROCEED. WE ARE WORKING TO TRY

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.321
TO ADDRESS AND UNDERSTAND WHERE

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:07.157
WATER SYSTEMS ARE AT ONE OF THE

00:57:07.223 --> 00:57:08.191
LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:10.293
DROUGHT WAS A LOT OF SMALL

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.295
WATER SYSTEMS DON'T ACTIVELY.

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.364
MONITOR THEIR WELL DEPTHS OR

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.633
THEIR INTAKE THE LEVEL OF THEIR

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:18.234
INTAKE AND RESERVOIRS WERE-

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:19.335
WORKING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE

UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE'S A

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:26.910
CRISIS COMING BEFORE WE GET THE

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:28.278
CALL AT FOUR THIRTY FRIDAY

00:57:28.344 --> 00:57:29.579
AFTERNOON THAT THE OTHER OUT OF

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:31.314
WATER AND THEY YOU KNOW NEED

EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FROM US OR

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.051
OTHERS TO TRY TO GET THEM BACK

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:37.720
IN. SERVICE AND WHAT START FROM

YOUR FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT

00:57:39.689 --> 00:57:41.624
IS THAT STARTED IN THE RAINY

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:43.426
SEASON'S OVER RIGHT SO WOULD

MONITORING IMMEDIATELY I MEAN

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:55.071
WE'VE GOT. 50% LESS THAN 50%

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:57.040
WATER. PRECIPITATION NOT TO AND

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:57.841
YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE LAW

00:57:57.907 --> 00:57:59.175
LEVELS TO RECOVER. THE DROUGHT

00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:00.844
SO THERE ALREADY A STRESS

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:02.178
CONDITIONS THE MANTRA NEEDS TO

00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:03.947
BEGIN NOW- AND THAT'S WHAT

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.114
WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS TRYING TO

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:05.648
MAKE SURE WE GATHER THAT

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:07.483
INFORMATION FROM THEM- AND MAKE

SURE THAT THEY ARE PERFORMED

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.653
THAT MONITORING SO THAT THEY'RE

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.221
ALSO AWARE. OF THEIR CURRENT

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:14.023
CONDITION. THE OTHER THING I'D

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.024
LIKE TO MENTION AS WELL IS

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:17.627
THAT. A LOT OF OUR WATER

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:19.996
SYSTEMS HAVE BACKUP SUPPLIES-

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:22.298
IN IN RECENT TIMES AS MANY OF

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:23.700
THOSE SUPPLIES WERE WELL THAT

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:25.068
WERE ACTIVE BUT THEY TOOK. OFF

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:27.170
OF ACTIVE STATUS DUE TO. WATER

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:29.672
QUALITY CONTAMINATION FROM. ONE

00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:31.474
TWO THREE T. C. P. OR FROM P.

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:33.042
BASS COMPOUNDS THAT WE'RE NOW

00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:34.110
FINDING. IN MANY OF OUR

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:37.247
SOURCES. AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO

00:58:37.313 --> 00:58:38.181
WORK WITH WATER SYSTEMS AS

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:39.649
WELL- WILL PRIORITIZE FROM OUR

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:41.384
ACTION. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:42.952
ADDRESS IT IS MAKING SURE THAT

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:46.022
WE ARE ABLE TO- PERMIT US

00:58:46.089 --> 00:58:47.991
SOURCES AND GET WATER QUALITY

00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:49.292
TREATMENT ON THOSE SYSTEMS

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:50.660
BEFORE THEY ARE. NECESSARY TO

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:53.296
BRING BACK ON LINE. AND THAT

00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:54.430
OBVIOUSLY INVOLVES INVESTMENT

00:58:54.497 --> 00:58:55.932
ON THEIR PART AND OUR PART FROM

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:58.201
OUR FUNDING PROGRAMS. INTO A

00:58:58.268 --> 00:59:00.136
PERMITTING ACTIVITY SO WE'RE

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:00.904
REACHING OUT TO THOSE SYSTEMS

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.839
WE NOW HAVE THAT. SCENARIO AND

00:59:02.906 --> 00:59:03.740
MAKING SURE THAT THEY

00:59:03.806 --> 00:59:05.642
PROGRESSED NOW IT'S YOU KNOW

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:06.976
CONSTRUCTION'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT

00:59:07.043 --> 00:59:07.777
AND THE BEST OF TIMES IT'S

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:09.212
HORRIBLE. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.114
RUSSIA AND WE KNOW MATERIALS

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.649
AND OTHER THINGS ARE DIFFICULT

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:13.783
TO FIND IN THE CURRENT

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:14.884
CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENT SO WE

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:16.419
NEED TO. MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:20.490
WHO WATER SYSTEMS UNDERSTANDS.

00:59:20.556 --> 00:59:21.124
IMPERATIVE TO BEGIN THAT ACTION

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.392
NOW. IN FINDING ALL MEANT IS A

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:23.793
WE'RE ALL TAKING EARLIEST TO

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.462
MAKE SURE WE WORK. WITH OUR

00:59:26.529 --> 00:59:27.063
DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS AS

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:29.699
THEY- RECEIVE INTO CARTEL MEN'S

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:31.434
LAST TIME THERE IN THE LAST

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:32.535
DROUGHT WE HAD TWENTY TWO WATER

00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:35.204
SYSTEMS. WHERE WE ISSUED A

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.106
FOLLOW ON BUILDING MORATORIUM.

00:59:37.173 --> 00:59:38.675
AFTER CURTAILMENT WAS ISSUE TO

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:39.409
MAKE SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T

00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:42.345
CONTINUE TO ADD WATER DEMANDS

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:43.846
TO THEIR SYSTEM AS THEIR WATER

00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:46.549
SYSTEM WAS CURTAILED. HOPEFULLY

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.284
ALL THE SYSTEMS OF NOW AND PART

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:49.986
OF ARE RELEASING HIM FROM THAT.

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:51.788
MORATORIUM WASN'T THEY DID

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:53.756
SECURE ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES AND

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:54.791
MOST OF THE WATER SYSTEMS WERE

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.659
ABLE TO. TO DO THAT WELL NOW

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:58.294
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A CHANCE TO

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:01.230
TEST OUT HOW. HOW VIABLE AND

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:01.898
NOW WERE THEY ABLE TO GET THOSE

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:04.000
ALL IN PLACE- AS WE MOVE

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:08.004

FROM THE LAST DROUGHT JEAN

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:38.835
HIGHLIGHTED IN THE- POWER POINT

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:39.736
A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.571
LOOKING AT KIND OF WHAT

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:42.238
HAPPENED DURING THE DROUGHT

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:44.474
THE- EXPERIENCE OF DOING

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.577
CURTAILMENTS IN THE FOURTEEN

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:48.578
FIFTEEN TIME PERIOD WE ISSUED

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:51.347
ABOUT NINE THOUSAND NOTICES OF

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:53.916
WATER UNAVAILABILITY TO. WATER

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:54.517
RIGHT HOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:58.654
STATE. BY ANDY. THE EXPERIENCE

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:00.390
OF TRYING TO CALCULATE AND

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:02.258
DETERMINE WHEN THOSE CURTAILING

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.360
NOTICES WERE NEEDED. AND THEN

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:06.029
TRACKING AND KIND OF RESPONDING

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:07.497
TO THEM IN LOOKING AT. HOW WE

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.065
LOOK AT WATER AVAILABILITY KIND

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:11.267
OF IN GENERAL THROUGHOUT. LOTS

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.169
OF DIFFERENT WATER BASINS AND

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:15.204
WATERSHEDS IN THE STATE. WAS

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.440
EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.642
RELIED ON SOME OLDER AND OUT OF

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:24.013
DATE DATA. THE PRIOR TO SB

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:24.614
EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH WAS PASSED

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.416
IN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN.

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:28.051
WATER DIVERTERS ONLY REPORTED

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.952
ABOUT ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS.

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:30.953
AND THEN THERE WERE SOME

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.221
CHANGES MADE DURING THE LAST

01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:33.489
DROUGHT TO UPDATE THAT

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:35.058
FREQUENCIES NOW IT'S NEARLY.

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:36.459
BUT WE'RE STILL RELYING ON DATA

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.528
THAT SUBMITTED SOMETIMES

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:40.730
EIGHTEEN OR MORE MONTHS AFTER

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:44.267
THE FACT AND IT. THERE ARE SOME.

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:46.402
CHALLENGES IN THE STATE'S WATER

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:48.905
RATES DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.173
HOW THAT INFORMATION IS

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:52.141
REPORTED HOW IT'S YOU A OR OR

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.143
QUALITY CHECKED ESSENTIALLY.

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.578
MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.947
RESPOND QUICKLY OR EVEN TRACK

01:01:58.014 --> 01:01:59.749
WHERE WATER IS BEING USED ON A

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:00.783
THEY WERE CLOSE TO REAL TIME

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.419
BASIS AND WEBER FINDING DURING.

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:04.887
THIS YEAR AS WELL AS OTHER DRY

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:06.422
CONDITIONS IS THAT IT'S

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:07.924
IMPORTANT ACTUALLY TO TRACK

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.692
WHERE THINGS ARE GOING AND

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:10.126
WATER USE AND WATER

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:12.128
AVAILABILITY A MUCH MORE KIND

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.197
OF GRANULAR AN UP TO DATE TIME

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.332
FRAME. SOME OF THE LESSONS

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.034
LEARNED ARE THAT WE DO NEED

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:20.636
KIND OF INVESTMENTS IN. OUR

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:23.106
WATER RATES SYSTEM RIGHT NOW

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.941
THE- THE STATE'S WATER RATE

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.976
RECORDS ARE ALL HELD IN PAPER

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:30.413
FILES IN- A STORAGE ROOM IN THE

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.314
KELLY PA BUILDING IN

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.950
SACRAMENTO. AND SO VIEW THAT ON

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:35.818
ITS OWN RAISES CHALLENGES ABOUT

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.186
EVEN HOW STAFF CAN ACCESS THE

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.554
DATA PARTICULARLY DURING COPING

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.890
TIMES AND- OTHER PUBLIC ACCESS

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.792
IS THAT DATA AS WELL MAKES IT

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:43.292
JUST DIFFICULT TO REALLY

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.528
UNDERSTAND. WHO OWNS A WATER

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.330
RATE WHAT- WHAT RATE IS

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:49.365
AVAILABLE TO WHOM WHERE IT'S

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.233
BEING USED WHEN IT'S BEING

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.802
USED. AND HOW DO YOU INTEGRATE

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:56.139
THAT KIND OF A WATERSHED SCALE.

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:56.973
TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.741
VOLUNTARY APPROACHES TO BETTER

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.610
WATER MANAGEMENT OR GREATER

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:02.879
WATER EFFICIENCY. SO I THINK

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.981
WITH THAT ALL. OUR STUFF AND

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:06.816
HEADED BACK TO JUNIOR ANY OTHER

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:10.553
QUESTIONS. ONE WHEN WE HOLD

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.021
QUESTIONS FOR A SECOND AND

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:14.590
BEFORE I RECOGNIZE FINANCE I

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:17.827
WANT TO TAKE A- COUPLE MINUTE

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:20.429
BREAK- IF YOU GUYS CAN PAUSE

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:21.063
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK SO DON'T

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:39.415
GO ANYWHERE.

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:40.983
DO YOU THANK YOU

ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:50.793
HAVE BEFORE WE TURNED IT OVER

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.597
TO PRESENTATION TO THE L. L. DR

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.131
OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I JUST

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.334
COUPLE POINTS I KNOW THE AGENDA

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.336
HAS A CHORE OF EXPENDITURES

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:03.072
MADE- APPROPRIATIONS MADE IN

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:04.707
THE LAST DROUGHT- JUST COUPLE

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:06.942
THINGS KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW SAID

SEN THE LAST RATHER HAVE BEEN

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.378
SIGNIFICANT- WATER

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:10.513
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:11.680
HE PRIMARILY THROUGH

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:14.149
PROPOSITION ONE AND PROPOSITION

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.518
SIXTY EIGHT WHICH YOU KNOW.

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:17.253
RIDER POSSIBLY SEVEN BILLION

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.355
DOLLARS IN DIFFERENT- WATER

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:22.858
PROJECT INVESTMENT- SENT THE-

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:23.993
MADE A LOT OF THINGS EVIDENCE

IN THEY BREAKING WATER AND I

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:27.496

ANNUALLY. TO SUPPORT THAT

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:36.539
EFFORT. AND EVEN IN THE CURRENT

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:38.140
GOVERNMENT BUDGET THERE ARE

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:38.774
SOME ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT THAT

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.576
WE DO THINK THAT COULD SUPPORT

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:43.812
DURING- YOU KNOW DROUGHT TIMES

DURING THE LAST DROUGHT IS

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:13.135
THINKING ABOUT BEING PROACTIVE

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.737
RATHER THAN REACTIVE WE ARE

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:16.538
LUCKY THAT WE HAVE THESE

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:18.407

LINING I GUESS OF WHAT WE WENT

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.744
THROUGH A FEW YEARS AGO SO IT'S

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:22.411
GREAT THEY'RE HAVING THIS

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:23.746
DISCUSSION TODAY AND REALLY

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.447
THINKING STRATEGICALLY ABOUT

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:29.685
WHAT WE CAN DO TO GET AHEAD OF.

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:30.319
OF CONDITIONS ARE WORSENING. IF

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:31.487
YOU LOOK AT THAT CHART ON PAGE

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:32.254
TWENTY SIX OF YOUR AGENDA

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:34.356
YOU'LL SEE WE DID. SPEND THREE

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:35.958
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OVER

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:37.059
THAT FOUR YEAR PERIOD DURING

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.293
THAT THE LAST DROUGHT IN

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.862
DROUGHT RESPONSE. BUT YOU'LL

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.730
SEE THAT THE OF THE BOOK OF IT

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:43.132
WAS IN THAT FIRST CATEGORY

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.867
WATER SUPPLY THAT WAS MOSTLY

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:46.535
SUPPORTED BY BONDS. AND THOSE

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:49.004
ARE MOSTLY LONGER TERM-

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:51.073
PROJECTS SO THEY REALLY DIDN'T

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.609
RESPOND TO THAT. THE LAST

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.344
DROUGHT BECAUSE FUNDS TAKE

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.779
AWHILE TO GET OUT THE DOOR THE

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:58.113
PROJECTS TAKE A WHILE TO

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.349
FINANCE AND PERMIT AND SO

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:01.617
HOPEFULLY THOSE WILL HELP US IN

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:02.685
THIS NEW DROUGHT THAT WE'RE

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.586
FACING. BUT AS YOU THINK ABOUT

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:05.821
YOUR PACKAGE THINKING ABOUT

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:07.990
BALANCING KIND OF IMMEDIATE

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.159
NEAR TERM RESPONSE TO PRESSING

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:11.960
SITUATIONS AS COMPARED TO

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:13.696
LONGER TERM RESILIENCE BOTH ARE

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:15.531
IMPORTANT- BUT THOSE BIGGER

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:16.732
LONGER TERM PROJECTS WON'T

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:18.867
NECESSARILY ADDRESS IMMEDIATE

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:21.170
NEEDS. AND THEN ALSO GLAD LEASE

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.471
TO HAVE CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:25.340
FUND SOURCE AND- AS I MENTIONED

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.142
YOU KNOW WE USE MOSTLY BOND.

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:28.977
AND MANY SUFFERED FOR THOSE BIG

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:30.779
PROJECTS LAST TIME AND THOSE

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.915
TAKE AWHILE WE REALLY DID RELY

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.650
ON GENERAL FUND AND IN SOME

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.085
CASES SPECIAL FUNDS FOR SOME OF

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:38.087
THOSE IMMEDIATE. EMERGENCY

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.755
RESPONSE WATER CONSERVATION

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:44.159
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:44.693
ACTIVITIES YOU SEE IN THAT

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.527
CHART. AND ANOTHER THING THAT

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.162
ABOUT A BALANCE THE HUMOR NEED

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:48.430
OF DROUGHT IMPACTS AS WELL AS

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:49.965
THE ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS THE

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.266
STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:53.335
MANAGING PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.270
INCLUDING FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:57.873
AND- AND WATERWAYS. AND THOSE

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:58.941
THAT HAD SOME PRETTY

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.309
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS DURING THE

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:01.577
LAST DROUGHT SO MAKING SURE AS

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:02.478
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:03.579
CONSTRUCTING ANY FUNDING

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:04.913
PACKAGE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.316
BOTH OF THOSE. CATEGORIES WE

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:09.051
NEED. AND THEN EVEN WITHIN THE

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:11.854
HUMAN NEEDS. I'M THINKING ABOUT

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.955
IN PARTICULAR VULNERABLE

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.723
COMMUNITIES THE LAST DURING THE

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.091
LAST DROUGHT AS WAS MENTIONED

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.559
RURAL FARM WORKER COMMUNITIES

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:19.795
REALLY- EXPERIENCE SOME VERY

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.330
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS NOT ONLY

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.664
FROM FROM LOSS OF DRINKING

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:24.633
WATER BUT ALSO ECONOMIC IMPACTS

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.535
FROM LOSS OF JOBS FROM.

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:27.836
AGRICULTURAL AT PRODUCTION

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:30.305
SLOWDOWN SO THINKING ABOUT HOW

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:31.840
THE STATE CAN HELP THOSE. WHO

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:33.008
TO TARGET AID TO THOSE WHO

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.110
MIGHT NEED IT MOST. AND THEN

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.378
FINALLY AND WE THINK IT'S

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:38.113
IMPORTANT TO NOTE WE PUT OUT A

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.616
RECORD ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO ON

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:42.584
THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT.

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:43.886
WHICH IS THAT KIND OF A NEW

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:45.721
COMPLICATING FACTOR IS A FAR

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.122
STATE BUDGET PROCESS WASN'T

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:48.157
COMPLICATED ENOUGH NOW WE'VE

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:50.359
GOT A NEW FACTOR- THAT PROBABLY

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:51.927
IS GOING TO COME INTO PLAY AND-

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:54.229
PLAY SOME CONSTRAINTS ON ON

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.597
STATE SPENDING AND STATE

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:57.065
GENERAL FUND SPENDING PROCEEDS

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:58.901
OF TAXES. I'M NOT ONLY IN THE

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.169
COMING BUDGET BUT IN THE COMING

01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:02.137
YEAR SO IT'S PRETTY TECHNICAL

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:03.172
AND WE COULD HAVE A LONG

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:04.473
CONVERSATION ABOUT I'M HAPPY TO

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.641
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:07.209
HAVE IT BUT WE JUST WANT TO

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:07.776
HAVE THAT ON YOUR RADAR AS

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:08.844
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. THE

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.445
PACKAGE THAT THERE IS THE KIND

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:11.013
OF THIS NEW LEVEL OF

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:13.549
COMPLICATION- AND THEN THERE

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.117
ARE SOME THINGS THAT COUNT

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:16.351
TOWARDS THE LIMIT AND SOMETIMES

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:17.352
OF EXPENDITURES THAT DON'T

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:18.554
COUNT SOWE'RE HAPPY TO WORK

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.656
WITH YOU AS YOU. WORK THROUGH

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:22.057
YOUR YEAR BUT OVERALL BUDGET

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:22.958
PACKAGE BUT THAT'S JUST

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:24.726
ANOTHER. ISSUE TO HAVE ON YOUR

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:26.962
RADAR I HAVE THATCOPY OF IT ON

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:28.931
MY DESK AND I HAVE CRACKED THE

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.632
SEAL ON IT BUT IT WAS A- IT'S

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:34.036
SPECIAL READING. SO BEFORE WE

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.971
GET INTO THE YOU KNOW BASICALLY

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.639
IF YOU LOOK IF YOU TAKE OUT THE

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:40.242
BOND MONEY FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:45.914
TO TWENTY. SEVENTEEN FOR THOSE

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:46.515
FOUR YEARS WE PLAYED. SPENCER

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:47.716
NORTH OF BILLION. OVER EVERY.

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:49.017
OVER THE FOR YEARS WHICH IS A-

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:51.019
A QUARTER FOR THE- BILLION

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:53.088
DOLLARS. THIS IS TO BE TAKE OUT

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:55.991
TO. THE MONEY TO THE WATER JUST

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:56.859
SIX FOR THE- THE FEDERAL

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:57.960
FUNDING BUT WE'RE PUTTING

01:14:58.026 --> 01:15:00.462
TOGETHER FEDERAL FUNDS. GENERAL

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:03.298
FUNDS AND- ANY SCRAPES OF MONEY

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:04.733
THAT'S LEFT FROM THE BONDS YOU

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.768
KNOW SIXTY EIGHT AND ONE. SO

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:08.737
THIS IS RICK THIS IS REAL MONEY

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.672
THIS IS NOT. MIDDLE PROBLEM AND

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:13.175
WE'RE GOING TO FINANCE IT SO

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.910
THAT'S- YOU GIVE ME SOME IDEA

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:16.645
OF THE OF THE IMPACT OF PAINT

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:18.313
SPENDING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.982
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND TWO

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:21.383
HUNDRED AND- TWO POINT FIVE

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.518
BILLION. NOW OR IN A LOT ABOUT

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.854
THIS TEN TIMES AS MUCH FOR ALL

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:27.422
THESE THINGS THAT THAT THE

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.024
ADMINISTRATION HAS POINTED OUT

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.193
THAT WERE SORT OF LESSONS

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.128
LEARNED COMMUNITY. SEEMS LIKE A

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:37.966
GOOD IDEA. YEAH THERE ARE

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:40.302
CERTAINLY NEEDS CERTAINLY NEEDS

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:44.539
AND AGAIN ACTING EARLY AHEAD OF

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:47.242
WHEN- CONDITIONS WORSEN I

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:50.178
THINK- AGAIN EMPHASIZING HOW

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:51.947
MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES YOU WANT

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.215
TO FUND OUR KIND OF IMMEDIATE

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:54.983
AND WILL WILL MAKE A BIG

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.418
DIFFERENCE IN THE NEXT YEAR TO

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:58.120
VERSUS HOW MANY WILL MAKE A

01:15:58.186 --> 01:15:59.621
DIFFERENCE IN THAT SUBSEQUENT

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:00.822
DRUG BOTH ARE IMPORTANT IT'S

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:02.357
JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:04.559
THE AREAS OF FOCUS AND EVEN IF

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:06.128
YOU PUT ANOTHER IMPORTANT

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:07.062
CONSIDERATION IS EVEN IF YOU

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:08.597
PUT A LOT OF FUNDING OUT IN ONE

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:09.498
YEAR THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:10.766
MEAN IT WILL BE SPENT IN THAT

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:11.934
YOU'RE PARTICULARLY FOR SOME OF

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.902
THE LONGER TERM- PROJECTS SO

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:15.504
IT'S BALANCING KIND OF THAT

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.906
IMMEDIATE NEED. A LONGER TERM

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:20.475
NEED AND ALSO HOW WHAT TYPES OF

ACTIVITIES CAN BE IMPLEMENTED

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:26.148
ON A ON A QUICK BASIS VERSUS

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:05.026
HAVE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT TO

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:06.661
THE THEIR THEIR DECIDED NOT TO

COMPLETE THE PROJECTS A LOT OF

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:10.699
WATER RESTORATION SO THE GOAL

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:13.468
IS TO LOOK TO THE ALL THOSE

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.403
PROPS TO SCRAPE UP EVERYTHING-

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.105

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:18.907
PROP SIXTY EIGHT BUT IN PROP

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:22.077
PROPOSITION ONE WE NEGOTIATED

01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:24.679
AND THAT CONTRACT THAT IT WAS

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:27.182
GOING- IN THAT BILL THAT IT WAS

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:28.750
GOING TO BE FOR STORAGE THAT'S

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.252
HOW WE GOT ALL OF MOST OF THE

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:32.420
REPUBLICAN VOTE CAME FROM THE

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:35.824
FACT THAT. WE ACTUALLY.

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:38.593
DESIGNATED IT FOR STORAGE AND-

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:39.961
AND WE'RE NOT THERE WE SPENT A

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:42.397
WHILE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:44.266
THOSE FUNDS DIVERT OFF I STILL

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:45.300
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SITES

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:48.503
RESERVOIR TEMPERANCE FLAT. FOR

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.138
IT TO COME TO FRUITION SO THAT

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:51.539
WE IT DURING THESE TIMES WE

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:52.741
HAVE SEVERE DROUGHT WE ACTUALLY

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:54.609
HAVE SOME WATER AVAILABLE WELL

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:56.478
I THINK I THINK THE GOAL WOULD

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:57.679
BE NOT THAT YOU WOULD DIVERT IT

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.047
FROM. INVESTMENTS IN

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:01.549
AGRICULTURE AND GROUNDWATER

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:02.817
STORAGE BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:05.253
INTERVENING SIGMOD THAT IS

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.921
HELPING OUT WATER DISTRICTS AND

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:09.057
IF THE WATER BOARD DECIDES THAT

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:11.293
THE NEED IS THERE I GET IS THAT

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:11.993
C. IS JUST A SUGGESTION IT'S

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.529
NOT. A LOT OF BUDGET ITEM RIGHT

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.231
BECAUSE THERE'S- THERE'S

01:22:16.298 --> 01:22:17.365
DROUGHT THEY MAY HAVE

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.967
PRIORITIES THAT THEY SAY OKAY

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:22.037
WE NED TO. WE NEED TO HELP OUT

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:27.208
THIS AGRICULTURAL OF- ROGIC. I

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:28.143
DON'T KNOW CENTER WAREHOUSE WAS

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:31.613
OLDER. SUGGESTIONS TURN INTO.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.449
HAPPENINGS HERE AND THIS IS THE

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:37.919
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY HEY. D. D.

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:39.788

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:43.458
THEY'RE ALL PRIORITIES THERE'S

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:44.592
A TON OF CARS OUT THERE. BUT

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:47.228
WITHOUT CREATING MORE WATER

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:49.364
WHICH IS WHAT PROP ONE WAS. WAS

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.933
SOLD TO THE VOTERS AS- AND SOLD

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.201
TO THE LEGISLATURE WHO PASSED

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:54.803
THE LEGISLATION OUT HERE TO

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:57.105
CREATE THE PROPOSITION. IN OUR

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.173
DIVERTING THOSE FUNDS AWAY I

01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:59.307
WANT TO GO ON RECORD THAT I

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:00.442
THINK THAT'S THE WRONG YOU SOME

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:01.609
MONEY ALL RIGHT I THINK WE

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:02.811
SHOULD LEAVE THAT MONEY THERE

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:05.313
AND ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE ARE.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.715
THAT THE BOAT WHAT THE VOTERS.

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:08.483
EXPECTED US TO DO WHICH WAS TO

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:11.019
CREATE SOME STORAGE. SO I KNOW

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:12.887
WHAT HOW IT WORKS HERE IT GOES

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:13.955
TO THIS COMMITTEE. AND THEN IT

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:15.423
GOES TO THE BIG THREE. PRETTY

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:18.026
SOON. BECAUSE IT NOBODY STOOD

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:18.793
UP AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT IT

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:20.462
IT BECOMES. MAKING RECOVERY

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:22.063
ALREADY IN IT AND IT HAPPENS.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:23.365
PROP SIXTY IT WAS A DIFFERENT

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:25.066
SCENARIO PROP SIXTY EIGHT WAS

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:25.967
ALL THE VOTERS IN A DIFFERENT

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:28.136
WAY. SO I'M TALKING ABOUT PROP

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.604
ONE MONEY'S GOING TO. OTHER

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.506
PLACES THAN STORAGE NO BUT THIS

01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:33.007
IS JUST THE RIVER THAT. THE

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.843
WORDING THAT YOU'RE KEEN OFFICE

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.878

INVESTMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL IN

01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:43.351

IT IN. WATER STORED IN THE

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.212
CENTRAL VALLEY THAT'S- NOT

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:12.247
DISPUTED WE'RE NOT DISPUTING

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:13.148
THAT WOULD JUST SINK. IF

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:14.249
THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT COME

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:16.418
UP. BUT THAT'S IT THERE WAS TO

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:19.120
IDENTIFY PROJECTS AND- IN PROP

01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:20.655
ONE AND TRUST ME I'M I'M VERY

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:22.023
MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT SITES IT'S

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.858
OF. AWESOME PROJECT AND WE NEED

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:25.560
TO BUILD AND DIVERSIFY IT IS IN

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:27.695
THAT. IS IN THAT AS WELL. NOT

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:28.863
TO DIVERT THAT MONEY AWAY FROM

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:30.165
THOSE IS THE WRONG THING TO DO

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.900
I'M JUST I. I THINK I'VE HEARD

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:34.202
IT LET'S GO TO MISS. ELLERS AND

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:35.804
IT WILL GO TO MISTER SINISTER

AND. IN CENTER MCGUIRE- THANK

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:42.911
YOU MISS CHAIR JUST AS UP OF

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:44.512
CLEAR. SO PROP. WE INCLUDED A

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.147
BIT OF FUNDING AND I WAS JUST

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:46.748
LOOKING FOR THE MAGIC IT WAS

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:48.383
ROUGHLY FOUR BILLION FOR WATER

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.151
STORAGE. AND DEFERRED TO THE

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:51.453
WATER COMMISSION TO DECIDE HOW

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:52.987
TO ALLOCATE THAT- ACROSS

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:55.990
DIFFERENT PROJECTS THEY PICKED.

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:57.325
SEVEN DIFFERENT PROJECTS FOR

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.994
THAT- FOR INITIAL ALLOCATIONS-

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:03.598
OF WHICH- THIS PROJECT WAS ONE.

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:04.999
DIFFERENT ACCESS TEMPERANCE

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:06.668
FLAT WAS ONE HOWEVER TEMPERANCE

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.303
FLAT HAS SINCE DIED BY BELIEVE

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:10.338
LAST OCTOBER WITHDRAWN FROM THE

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:11.372
PROGRAMBECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:13.441
HAVE- SUFFICIENT FUNDING I

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:15.510
THINK. THAT'S WHERE TIM TO

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:18.246
MATCH THE STATE FUNDING SO-

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.547
THIS FUNDING COULDN'T BE

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:21.449
DIVERTED FOR PURPOSES OTHER

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:22.917
THAN WATER STORAGE WITHOUT

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:23.852
GOING BACK TO THE VOTERS

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:24.953
BECAUSE PROPOSITION ONE

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.721
REQUIRES THAT IT BE IS FOR. FOR

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.556
WATER STORAGE BUT IT'S REALLY

01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:30.091
UP TO THE WATER COMMISSION TO

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:30.959
DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE

01:25:31.025 --> 01:25:32.393
CONSISTENT WITH BOND LANGUAGE

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.029
ACROSS PROJECTS. AND I BELIEVE

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:37.098
THAT TEMPERANCE FLAT IS NOW NOT

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.634
WHEN IT HAD HAS WAS ORIGINALLY

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.269
I HAVE. DECIDED BY THE WATER

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:41.970
COMMISSION TO GET SOME AT

01:25:42.036 --> 01:25:43.404
FUNDING. BUT THEN HAS SINCE

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:44.973
WITHDRAWN SO MY UNDERSTANDING

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.107
IS THAT THESE FUNDS ARE STAR

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:47.909
WAITING FOR A NEW ALLOCATION AT

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:49.677
THIS POINT. WELL THEN LET ME

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.479
SUGGEST. THAT YOU USE THOSE

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:55.083
FUNDS. TO DESIGNATE THE

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:57.118
PROJECTS THAT WE DESIGNATED.

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:59.754
AND PROP ONE WHICH WAS- I THINK

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.489
LIVES MAY BE LOST FOR CAROL'S I

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:02.490
CAN'T REMEMBER WALL BUT I KNOW

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:04.058
THAT SITE IS ONE OF THOSE AND I

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:04.926
DON'T WANT TO THE POT IS

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.261
ALREADY. DWINDLED DOWN TO WHERE

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:07.662
WE CAN WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.130
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP US.

POINT ONCE YOU. WAIT THE LONGER

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:15.570
