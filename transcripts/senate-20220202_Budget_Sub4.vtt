OR ADOPTED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS

00:24:57.696 --> 00:24:58.697
AND IT ALSO SEEMS THAT THE

00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:00.398
LEGISLATURE WILL CONTINUE TO

00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:02.868

ABOVE THAT'S BASED ON ASSUMPTION

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:22.187
OF INCREASING WORKLOAD SO IF YOU

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:24.022
THINK THE LEGISLATURE WILL. DROP

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:25.891
SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER TAX CREDITS

THIS- GROUP- TARGETED HERE FOR

UNKNOWN- TAKE UP WILL BE A MAJOR

QUESTION AND SO THAT COULD.

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:10.482
GREATLY AFFECT THE FISCAL COST

00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:15.086
BE MORE THAN THAT OR LESS NOT

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:17.989
DEPENDING UPON TAKE OFF ON THE

STROKE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.892
MUCH A SINGLE QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:22.627
COMMITTEE I DO HAVE A COUPLE

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.562
QUESTIONS TO ME JUST SAY THAT I-

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:25.997
THIS IS REALLY AN INNOVATIVE

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:29.601
AND- UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY I THINK

00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:30.835
TO HELP SOME OF THE MOST

00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:33.805
VULNERABLE- INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.106
THAT COME THROUGH OUR SYSTEM

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:36.941
THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN-

00:29:37.008 --> 00:29:38.810
THE END UP AS FOSTER KIDS NOT

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:40.111
BECAUSE OF. SOMETHING THEY DID

00:29:40.178 --> 00:29:42.347
BUT BECAUSE OF AN INABILITY OF

00:29:42.413 --> 00:29:44.749
THE FAMILY REALLY TO. TO BE ABLE

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:47.685
TO RAISE THEM AND- SO I'M REALLY

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:50.188
EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS A- AS A AS

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:53.091
A PILOT PROJECT- THE QUESTIONS I

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.859
HAVE I THINK PROBABLY GET

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:55.927
ANSWERED ONCE WE HAVE SOME

00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:59.364
LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD DESCRIBE.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:04.102
HOW FOSTER KIDS WITH ACCESS R.

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:06.404
FOUGHT FOSTER INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:09.507
ACCESS THE RESOURCES- AND SO THE

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:10.642
QUESTIONS I HAVE ARE THINGS

00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:13.444
LIKE- IS THERE IS THERE THE

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.046
ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:17.115
SOCIAL SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO.

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:19.684
SEND NOTICES- TO THE

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:23.121
INDIVIDUALS- THAT MIGHT BE

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:24.789
ELIGIBLE SO THAT WERE REALLY. WE

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:32.463
HAVE A MUCH. BETTER. FRAMEWORK

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.300
OR- DATABASE I GUESS IS THE BEST

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:37.502
WAY TO PUT IT OUGHT TO BE ABLE

00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:39.237
TO IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:40.772
THAT MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE AND I SAY

00:30:40.838 --> 00:30:42.507
THAT BECAUSE THAT HE AYE TCS

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:44.275
REALLY BEEN SLOW ON THE UPTAKE

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:46.144
IN TERMS OF FAMILIES THAT ARE

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:50.248
ELIGIBLE IT'S BEEN HARD TO- TO

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:54.152
ACCESS. THE RESOURCES IF YOU

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:55.420
DON'T KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:57.722
AVAILABLE FOR YOU AND SO- I'M

00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:59.991
I'M I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:01.593
SOME MORE INFORMATION SO WE HAVE

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:02.894
A REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:07.665
HOW THIS- TAX CREDIT WOULD WORK.

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:10.902
HOW AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD. BE

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:12.637
IDENTIFIED THE RICH COULD YOU

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:14.505
SELF IDENTIFY AM A FOSTER CHILD

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:16.841
AND SO I'M- I'M STILL NOT A

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:20.044
BEIJING I'M IRISH I AM ELIGIBLE

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:23.014
FOR THIS MONEY- ALL THE DETAILS

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:24.716
OF THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:26.417
REALLY IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO

00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:28.620
ASK- AND- FINANCE TO TELL US

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:30.588
NOW- I EXPECT IT WILL GET SOME

00:31:30.655 --> 00:31:31.756
LANGUAGE IN WILL HAVE A BETTER

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:33.758
IDEA ON HOW THIS WOULD WORK BUT

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:34.692
I THINK IT'S A REALLY UNIQUE

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:37.729
AND- INTERESTING IDEA AND I AM.

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:39.764
I AM I'M IN SUPPORT THIS IS A

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:41.766
HOLD OPEN ITEMS SO WE WILL

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:43.534
CONTINUE TO HOLD IT OPEN WILL.

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:46.404
LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND- AND

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:48.139
SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:51.109
BE ABLE TO WORK MAYBE THIS THIS-

00:31:51.175 --> 00:31:56.014
WORKS ALONGSIDE THE EITC- AND WE

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.216
CAN USE THE FRAMEWORK. OF THE

00:31:58.283 --> 00:32:00.518
RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE BY THE

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.520

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:06.257
PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN. MAKE IT

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:08.793
MUCH MORE- WIDELY USED I THINK

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.561
THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT IF THE IF

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:12.597
WE CREATE A PROGRAM. AND IT'S A

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:14.699
PROGRAM TO HELP REDUCE POVERTY.

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:17.068
AND ONLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:18.670
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE

00:32:18.736 --> 00:32:20.872
ACT ACTUALLY CAN ACCESS THAT.

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:22.173

COMMUNITIES THAT JUST DON'T GET

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:31.716

THIS PROGRAM SO THAT ANY

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.521

PROGRAM. CANBE VIEWED THROUGH

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.891
THE LENS OF HOW TO ENHANCE THESE

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:16.560
METRICS. HISTORICAL START SHOW

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:18.996
THAT ALMOST 80% OF THE CALLIE

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:21.465
ATC CREDITS CLAIMED WERE FOR TWO

CONCEPTS WERE DEVELOPED AFTER

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.187
LISTEN SOLICITING AND EVALUATING

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:44.722
AND CLICK FROM NEARLY FIFTY

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.390
DIFFERENT NONPROFIT STAKEHOLDERS

YOU'LL KNOW WHEN READING THE

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:52.830
REPORT THAT THERE WAS PURPOSELY

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.565
NO RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:56.967
AS TO WHICH CONTACTS COULD OR

00:38:57.034 --> 00:38:58.836
SHOULD BE DONE. AS WE RESEARCH

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:00.404
THE CONCEPT BECAME CLEAR THAT

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:01.706
THERE ARE BENEFITS AND RISKS THE

00:39:01.772 --> 00:39:03.040
TAXPAYERS IN THE STATE THAT

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:04.408
SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:05.976
PRIOR TO MOVING FORWARD WITH

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:08.646
ANYONE CONCEPT. ADDITIONALLY

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:10.047
THERE ARE PROPOSALS THAT SHOULD

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:10.781
BE REVIEWED FURTHER THROUGH A

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:12.883
LEGAL LENS TO ENSURE THAT PRIOR

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.585
TO PURSUIT IT IS UNDERSTOOD IF

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:16.520
ANY LEGAL THEORIES EXIST. UNDER

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:18.289
FACT CAN BE OVERCOME TO PROTECT

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:19.790
BOTH THE TAXPAYERS THE STATE AND

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:21.625
ANY STUFF FOR VOLUNTEERS THAT

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:25.563
WOULD ENGAGE IN ANY. OF THESE

00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:26.397
PROPOSED NEW WORK EFFORTS. I

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:27.131
HAVE TO BE TO THE APPROACH OF

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:28.666
CREATING A COPPER. LISTING OF

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.167
THESE BENEFITS RISK AND LEGAL

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:32.603
CONCERNS. AS WELL AS NINETEEN

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.738
ADMINISTRATING TIGHT AND

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:35.139
MINISTRY OF TYPE ISSUES SUCH AS

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:37.141
RESOURCES NEEDED OR PROPOSED

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.843
TIMING FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THAT

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:40.244
WILL SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:42.179
DISCUSSION ON WHAT TO PURSUE HOW

00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:45.149
TO PURSUE IT AND WHEN IT IS MOST

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.617
FEASIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. SO

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:48.586
LET'S TAKE A SHORT WALK THROUGH

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:51.055
EACH CONCEPT. CONCEPT EIGHT

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:52.423
DEALS WITH THE SUGGESTION TO

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:53.991

FORM SINCE THE EARLY TWO

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:01.365

SERVICE. HOW FILE DOES ONLY

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:17.081
ALLOW FUTURE CAL FILE DOES ALLOW

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.749

FURTHER PURSUIT OF THIS CONCEPT

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.208
IS DESIRED IS THAT WILL NOT

FURTHER STUDY ILLEGAL ANALYSIS

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:31.335
WOULD BE NEEDED ON THIS CONCEPT.

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.270
AS THE IRS HAS STRICT RULES FOR

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:35.305

TAXPAYERS ARE SUPPORTED

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:40.924
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND NOT

LEFT WITH A SENSE OF UNEASE THAT

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.995
THIS IS A SPAM TYPE OUT REACH.

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:46.496
I'M TIMING WOULD ALSO BE

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:48.165
CRITICAL IF ANY PRE POPULATING

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:50.567
OF DATA IS DESIRED. BEST DATA IS

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:52.402
TYPICALLY NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL AT

FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE LAST

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:01.011
YEAR. WE WOULD JUST NOW BE

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:02.312
APPROACHING THE TIME FRAME WHERE

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:03.747
BEST DATA IS AVAILABLE TO

00:48:03.814 --> 00:48:06.149
CONDUCT OUTREACH. WHILE OUTRAGE

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.751
COULD BE CONDUCTED EARLIER YOU

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:08.952
RUN THE RISK THAT ANY PRE

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:10.988
POPULATED DATA IS INCOMPLETE AND

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:12.889
INCORRECT. ON THE CREDIT COULD

00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:14.925
BE UNDERSTATED OR OVERSTATED

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:17.294
PUTTING THE TAXPAYER IN AN

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:18.895
UNDESIRED POSITION. FINALLY IT'S

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:20.097
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FOR

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:21.865
DECADES TAX ENTITIES ACADEMIC

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:23.300

PARTNER ENTITIES HAVE CONDUCTED

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.937
THIS TYPE OF OUTREACH. AND ALL

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:28.338
THOSE EFFORTS DID PRODUCE

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:30.307
RESULTS WHICH IS GOOD NEWS AND

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:32.276
GENERAL THE RESPONSE RATE WAS

00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:34.344
TYPICALLY LESS THAN 25% AND IN

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:38.882
MANY OF THESE CASES LESS THAN 5%

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.284
CONCEPT EVEN LATE FOR CALIFORNIA

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.085
ISSUE IN A UNIQUE FINALLY NINETY

00:48:42.152 --> 00:48:44.454
THAT CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF AN

00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:46.456

WITH THE PROCESS CAN BE LENGTHY.

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:52.262
IMPORTANT GAPS UNDERSTAND IF

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:53.830
THIS CONCEPT IS FOR JUNE

00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:55.866
PERCENT. IDENTITY THEFT IS A

00:48:55.932 --> 00:48:57.367
CRIME A SIGNIFICANCE TODAY WITH

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:58.468
MANY SUGGESTING THERE ARE FEW

00:48:58.535 --> 00:49:00.671
INDIVIDUAL WHOSE PERSONAL DATA

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:02.572

SOME WAY. ANY FUNCTION ESTABLISH

VERIFIED IDENTITY IDENTITY

00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:16.320
EXCUSE ME AND BEST PRACTICES

NOT READ SEEN ADVANTAGE TO

00:49:30.067 --> 00:49:31.101
PURSUE THE ISSUE OF THE IN

COVER HAVE SUCH OFFICE LOCATIONS

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:43.680
TO MANAGE SUCH A PROGRAM WHICH

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:44.648
WOULD MEAN WE WOULD NEED TO

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:45.749
PARTNER WITH STRATEGICALLY

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:46.983
PLACED ENTITIES ACROSS THE

COMPROMISED. FINALLY AFTER THREE

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.395
WOULD NOT THE SOLUTION DOES NOT

00:49:58.462 --> 00:49:59.963
RESOLVE THE NEED FOR TAXPAYER TO

STUDY AND LEGAL ANALYSIS WOULD

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:13.377
BE NEEDED ON THIS CONCEPT AS

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:15.011
CYRUS AGAIN HOW STRICT AND

SCRIPT. I'M STILL ALL TIME AND

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:11.374

GOOD POINTS- KNOWLEDGE OF THE

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:20.450
CREDIT. IS CERTAINLY A JOB THAT

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:22.452
WE'VE SEEN AND HEARD I'M TRYING

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:24.454
TO ADDRESS IN THIS REPORT- AND

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:25.455
THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:26.890
TAXPAYERS THAT WE KNOW THAT ARE

00:55:26.956 --> 00:55:29.092
AWARE OF THE CREDIT. AND SHE'S

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.727
NOT TO CLAIM IT BECAUSE OF THE

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:34.164
EXPENSE AND THE BURDEN TO CLAIM

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.299

THEIR THEIR BEEN ON AND OFF

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.872
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- WHETHER

REQUIREMENT TO FILE A RETURN- DO

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:50.947

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:52.115
DEFINITION OF RIGHT OF RETURN

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:54.117

WOULD JUST BE A CALIFORNIA ONLY

00:55:57.187 --> 00:56:00.323
SOLUTION. WHICH DOESN'T- REALLY

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.825
GOT THE MONEY THAT'S MOST-

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:03.827
TREATED AT THIS TIME WHICH IS AT

00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:05.428
THE FEDERAL LEVEL- AND FEDERAL

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:06.763
DISCUSSIONS OF COURSE AND

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.698
SOLUTIONS ARE ARE REALLY OUTSIDE

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:11.034
OF THE SCOPE OF CONTROL OF F. T.

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:12.102
B. EVEN AS WE MIGHT TRY TO

00:56:12.168 --> 00:56:14.771
ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE THE IRS. ON

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:17.273
SOLUTIONS FOR THESE MATTERS. SO

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.675
I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:21.111
A LITTLE BIT- I JUST DON'T KNOW

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:24.914
THAT THERE IS A GOOD ANSWER TO

00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:25.949
YOUR QUESTION. WE DON'T. SUPPORT

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.450
LAST THING YOU SAID. BECAUSE I

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:29.052
LIKE HONESTY IF WE DON'T REALLY

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:30.320
HAVE AN ANSWER THEN I THINK IT'S

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:31.721
IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY THAT SO

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:32.756
THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:34.357
CONTINUE TO DISSECT THE

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:35.825
CHALLENGES SO THAT WE CAN GET TO

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:38.128
A BETTER RESOLUTION BUT- I JUST

00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:39.696
THINK WE DO OURSELVES A

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:41.698
DISSERVICE WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:43.199
CREATE GREATER TRUST BETWEEN

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:46.269
CALIFORNIANS AND THE STATE. WHEN

00:56:46.336 --> 00:56:47.904
WE MAKE IT HARD FOR FOLKS TO

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.305
HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT THEY

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:52.642
DESERVE- AND HOW WEEK BECAUSE

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:54.210
THAT'S HOW YOU CLOSE POVERTY

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:57.981
GAPS- AND SO YOU KNOW. ITHINK

00:56:58.047 --> 00:57:00.350
MAYBE THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE FOR

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:01.451
THE YEAR FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:03.620
THAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:06.890
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

00:57:06.956 --> 00:57:10.193
WHY I AM THAT'S THE REASON THAT

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.862
THE REPORT WAS COMMISSIONED- IT

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:15.231
WAS WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING

00:57:15.298 --> 00:57:18.301
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUTREACH

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:22.972
AND- AND I AGREE WITH YOU A 100%

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:24.974
WE'RE- SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.976
ON OUTREACH AND NOT ENOUGH ON

00:57:27.043 --> 00:57:29.279
GETTING. YOU KNOW THE MONEY TO

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:30.947
THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY NEEDED

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:33.082
AND I UNDERSTAND IT I JUST LET

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:35.151
ME JUST SAY THAT LISTENING TO

00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:37.287
YOU EXPLAIN THE CHALLENGES OF

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:41.558
EACH ONE OF THESE OPTIONS- WAS

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:43.893
REALLY INSTRUCTIVE. BECAUSE WHEN

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.396
YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:48.264
SOLUTIONS ARE EASY TO MAKE IT'S

00:57:48.331 --> 00:57:49.899
EASY TO MAKE THEM EASY WHY CAN'T

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:51.067
WE JUST GET THIS MONEY INTO THE

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:53.870
HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. ARE

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:57.607
DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY. AND-

00:57:57.674 --> 00:57:58.975
AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLE

00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:00.777
THING BUT IT'S NOT AND SO PART

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:03.213
OF I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:05.248
IS LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE OUTLINED.

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:07.016
AND I THINK WHAT MIGHT BE

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:09.919
HELPFUL IS IT AND I DON'T KNOW

COUPLE OF MONTHS AND WE'RE

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.940
CURRENTLY WORKING- WITH OTHER

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:59.809
DEPARTMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:01.244

DO HAVE- LET ME JUST SAY THAT TO

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.826
THE EXTENT THAT. I THINK IT'S

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:21.397
BEING DEVELOPED- I MIGHT MY TWO

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:26.402
CENTS WORTH IS- AND I THINK I MY

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.871
BIGGEST CONCERN WITH IT IS THAT

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:31.707
IN YEARS PAST. THIS WOULD HAVE

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:32.842
BEEN PUT IN A BUDGET BUT THE

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:35.044
POLICY WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED TO

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.113
BE CARRIED BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.748
AND- THE REASON THAT BECOMES

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:40.416
IMPORTANT IS THEN WE HAVE INPUT

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.718
INTO WHAT. WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:44.754
TAX CREDIT IF WE'RE GONNA DO

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.125
CREDITS- THAT THAT- THAT MAKE

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:51.928
MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMY

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:52.628
WHICH IS USUALLY WHAT TAX

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:54.030
CREDITS ARE ALL ABOUT WANT TO

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:57.033
MAKE SURE THAT. NUMBER ONE THAT

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:59.068
IT WILL ACHIEVE GOALS THAT WE

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:00.636
SET UP WERE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:02.505
THOSE GOALS NUMBER TWO THAT

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.440
EVERY REGION IN THE STATE CAN

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:08.511
PARTICIPATE IN. IN HAVING THE

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:10.413
TAX CREDIT IN THE COMMUNITY SO

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:11.447
THAT THEY'RE CREATING JOBS IN

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:14.050
THEIR COMMUNITY- AND WE TEND TO

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:17.753
SEE THAT THE TAX CREDITS GO.

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.022
FIVE WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES THAT

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:22.625
ALREADY HAVE A GOOD JOB BASE AND

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:26.195
SO- SO MY COURT MY BIG QUESTION

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:27.730
IS WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATED GOAL

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.098
WE'RE TRYING TO REACH AND I KNOW

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:33.669
IT'S A- IT IS. TO MITIGATE

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:36.205
CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT AS WE START

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:37.173
TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.442
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ON THE

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:43.746
FOREFRONT OF. SHEPHERDING IN OUR

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:47.850
SOLAR ENERGY AND ELECTRIC

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:50.052
VEHICLES AND YET WE- WHEN YOU

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:52.555
LOOK AT THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:55.424
ARE CREATED- IF YOU PUT SOLAR ON

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:57.193
YOUR RESIDENCE NONE OF THE

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.394
PANELS COME FROM THE STATE OF

01:04:58.461 --> 01:04:59.795
CALIFORNIA YET WE HAVE THE

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:02.064
ABILITY TO MAKE PANELS AND SO

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:03.866
WHY AREN'T WE USING A TAX

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:07.236
CREDIT. TO BUILD- SOLAR PANELS

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:08.938
THEY GET USED ON THE HOMES IN

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.506
OUR OWN STATE IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:13.776
PRIORITIZE. ELECTRIC BUSES WHICH

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.878
IS ONE OF THE AGENDA ITEMS FOR

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:18.147
THE BUDGET IS TO START FOCUSING

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:21.284
ON. ELECTRIC BUSES AND I BELIEVE

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:21.984
IT IF I RECALL IT WAS FOR

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:24.553
SCHOOLS. IT'S A TERRIFIC GOAL

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.888
IT'S WONDERFUL I SUPPORTED BUT

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:26.922
WHY AREN'T WE BUILDING I'M HERE

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.024
IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA AND IF

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.458
WE ARE GOING TO BUILDING HERE.

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.427
THEN THE TAX CREDIT OUT TO GO TO

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:34.830
MEET THE GOALS OF THOSE BUSES

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.299
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:36.966
PURCHASING HERE IN THE STATE OF

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:38.968
CALIFORNIA SO I'D LIKE TO THINK

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:41.203
THAT WE CAN- FOCUS ON

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.905
MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THE STATE

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:44.607
WHICH WE'VE LOST OVER THE YEARS.

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:45.941
AND WHICH WOULD READ IT REALLY

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:48.311
BENEFIT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.880
COMMUNITIES IN. A CUP-

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:52.848
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DESPERATE

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.784
FOR GOOD JOBS. AND THAT ARE

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.752
HAVING A CHALLENGE BECAUSE-

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:58.054
THEY'RE NOT COMING TO OUR

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.323
COMMUNITY SO. THIS IS A HOLLOW

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:03.759
OPEN ITEM I AM HOPING THAT AS WE

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:06.262
LOOK TO- INVESTMENTS IN IN TO

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:07.596
MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.665
ALSO LOOK AT JOB CREATION AND

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.667
THE ABILITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:14.603
MAKE THIS TRANSITION TO. TO TO

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.006
JOBS AT THAT ARE DESPERATELY

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:18.274
NEEDED IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:21.043
SO- AGAIN THIS IS A HOLD OPEN

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.046
ITEM. MORE ON THAT LATER BECAUSE

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:25.047
WE JUST DON'T HAVE ANY

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.749
INFORMATION ON THAT. ARE MOVING

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.485
ON WE'RE GOING TO- MOVE ON TO

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:31.721
THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION THIS

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:33.823
IS ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY THREE.

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:37.059
WHICH IS THE- REMOVAL OF

THAT. A REVENUE GENERATING

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:16.365
POSITIONS WERE BEING REDIRECTED

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:17.533

PROPOSES REMOVING THE PROVISION

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.372
ONE LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT HINDERS

THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFICIENCIES

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:27.276

WORK DONE- AND WE GO ON ABOUT

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.051
AND BEYOND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:10.419
CAN DO IT. OVER THE YEARS

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:13.389
PROVISION ONE WHICH HAS BEEN N

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:14.356
PLACE- I'LL DESCRIBE IT IS IT

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:15.691
WAS REALLY PUTTING BECAUSE THAT

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.126
REALLY DRIVES IT HOME WHEN YOU

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:19.061
TALK ABOUT HOW IT WAS DONE. IN

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:23.966
THE VERY. LATE NINETIES- WITH AN

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:26.435
R. OR- AND AUDITOR THAT WORKS

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:28.003
WITH A TAXPAYER CONSIDERED

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:30.639
PROVISION ONE. HOWEVER AN

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.741
AUDITOR THAT USES A MAIL ROOM TO

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:34.310
ISSUE A NOTICE OR USES

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:36.479
TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:37.913
EFFICIENT AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:40.049
OR NEEDS TO GO TO TRAINING OR

01:08:40.115 --> 01:08:41.951
NEEDS TO BE MANAGED NONE OF

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:43.986
THOSE OUTLINE ACTIVITIES WHICH

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.621
ARE NECESSARY FOR THE AUDITOR TO

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:47.957
BE- ADDITION AND EFFECTIVE AT

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:49.959
WHAT THEY DO ARE CONSIDERED

01:08:50.025 --> 01:08:51.727
PROVISION ONE. BY THE TIME YOU

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.095
LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE ANCILLARY

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.830
ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT THAT

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:56.565
HONOR HE ALMOST ARE NOT AN

01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:58.167
ORGANIZATION THAT'S ENTIRELY

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.702
PROVISION ONE WHICH FOR THE

01:08:59.768 --> 01:09:02.438
NEGATES THE NEED FOR THAT TYPE

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:04.306
OF A PROVISION IN PLACE. NEVER

01:09:04.373 --> 01:09:05.908
THE LESS OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.544
BEEN- REMINDED THAT- AUTRES OUR

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:09.678
AUDITORS ON THEIR PART A

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.080
PROVISION ONE COLLECTORS BY

01:09:11.146 --> 01:09:12.414
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS ARE PART OF

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.783
PROVISION ONE- AND THOSE OTHER

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.785
FOLKS ARE NOT. WITH THE WAY THAT

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:17.486
WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:19.755
OPERATIONS TODAY- BECAUSE OF THE

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:21.156
TRYING TO THE TIME OR BECAUSE OF

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:23.792
OUR EDR PROJECT- AND NOW EASIER

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.194
TO YOU. WE ARE VERY

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.829
COMPREHENSIVE SPIDER WEB OF

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:28.597
FUNCTIONS THAT ALL WORK OGETHER

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:32.101
SUCCESSFULLY OR NOT WORK

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.169
TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY. SO- BUT A

01:09:34.236 --> 01:09:35.671
KEY EXAMPLE AGAIN THAT I CAN

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:36.939
POINT OUT IN RECENT YEARS WHEN

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:39.608
EDR CAME FORWARD TRAINING WAS A

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.377
JOB THAT WE HAD MISSED AND AN

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:42.878
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:43.879
TRAINING WAS GOING TO BE

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.514
IMPORTANT WITH A MASSIVE CHANGES

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:48.083
WE WERE DEALING. SO PER TRAINING

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:50.286
IS NOT CONSIDERED PROVISION ONE.

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.587
THAT SHOULD BE DID NOT PUT

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.122
ADEQUATE RESOURCE TEAM FORWARD

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:55.324
AND BCPS SO THIS DEPARTMENT WE

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.525
STRUGGLED WITH FINDING

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.327
RESOURCES. THAT COULD BE

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:00.029
REDIRECTED TO TRAIN ALL OF OUR

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:02.698
STUFF- AND IN SOME SITUATIONS WE

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:04.233
SUCCEEDED IN OTHERS WE DIDN'T

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.201
RESULTING IN LOSS OF RETRAINING

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:07.536
EFFORTS THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.138
AND STOCKS THAT REALLY STRUGGLE

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:10.706
TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE NEW

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:13.576
TOLLS- MAS OF LESSONS LEARNED

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:15.644
SO- IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST SAY

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:17.046
OF TO BE WOULD VERY MUCH SUPPORT

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:18.647
THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.849
OPTIMIZE OUR- ACTIONS AND OUR

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:23.218
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR RESOURCE GAPS

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:24.453
THE PRESENT AND THE DEPARTMENT

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.055
THAT COULD NOT OTHERWISE BE

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:29.458
TIMELY SOLVED BY A BUDGET CHANGE

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:30.092
PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANKS VERY

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:34.063
MUCH. THIS IS DARK SINISTER AND

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.898
FINANCE WE HAVE JASON FROM

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:38.233
TEACHING BAY TO DISCUSS SOME OF

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.536
THE IMPACTS THEIR AT THE TV

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:43.272
TAMPAK. SURE THANK YOU DEREK AND

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:46.809
JUST- I CONTINUE OFF OF WHAT AND

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:49.511
SHE HAD SAID I'M HONEST BEHIND-

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:51.413
PROVISIONAL ONE IS THAT YOU CAN

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.448
THERE'S A YOU CAN DISTINGUISH

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:54.283
REVENUE MAKING FROM NON REVENUE

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.285
MAKING POSITIONS AND I THINK IN

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:58.787
REALITY. ALL FUNCTIONS PLAY A

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:01.290
ROLE IN- IN GENERATING REVENUE

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:03.892
WE JUST GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:06.829
ONE IS OUR DATA SCIENTISTS- AND

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:08.530
I WOULD ASSUME IT'S THE SAME ON

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.399
THAT THE- WE HAVE TO BE OUR DATA

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.167
SCIENTISTS TODAY ARE CONSIDERED

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:15.104
NON REVENUE MAKING- BUT- THEY

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.539
ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF- WORK THAT

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.475
DOES. GENERATE REVENUE FOR

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.609
EXAMPLE THEY IDENTIFY

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:22.711
NONCOMPLIANCE WHICH DENSER AS

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:25.014
LEADS FOR AUDITORS TO GO ON FIND

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.882
MORE MONEY ANOTHER EXAMPLE I

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.450
THINK SIMILAR TO A GENIUS THAT

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:30.552
IS OUR AUDIT SUPERVISORS ARE

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.254
CONSIDERED NON REVENUE MAKING

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:34.189
TODAY- OF COURSE THEY'RE

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:36.992
ESSENTIAL FOR AUDITS- BECAUSE-

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.028
ON DAYS LIKE BUSINESSES TO ON

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:41.830
IT- THEY REVIEW AUDITS- AND SO

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:43.132
THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:45.034
BUT BASICALLY. PROVISIONAL ONE I

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.602
THINK THE PROMISE ON THIS NOT AS

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:48.037
RELEVANT TODAY AS IT MIGHT HAVE

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:49.872
BEEN IN THE PAST AND IT DOESN'T

01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:51.607

WE'VE- DETERMINED ARE IMPORTANT-

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:32.447
AND THERE'S NO REASON IT NEW

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.916
TASK FOR SHOULD BE UNNECESSARILY

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:37.819
DELAYED. OUT BUT MY

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:40.155
UNDERSTANDING IS THIS- PROVISION

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:44.426
ONE- PROCESS JUST REQUIRES A

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.094
LETTER TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.896
AND TO ME THAT DOESN'T SEEM

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.765
OVERLY BURDENSOME BUT IF THERE'S

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.333

GIVE FLEXIBILITY THAT'S GOOD

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.519
BUT- I THINK THERE WAS A REASON

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:11.987
THIS WAS IMPOSED IN THE FIRST

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:13.155

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:19.361
SO- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ITEMS

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:20.862
THAT WE ARE GOING TO HOLD OPEN

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:21.997
