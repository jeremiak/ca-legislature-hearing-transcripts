THREE EIGHTY ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL. AND I DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. AB THREE EIGHTY ONE SIMPLY EXPANDS ON EXISTING ORIENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE REQUIRING EDUCATION. AND PROGRAMMING ABOUT INTIMATE PARTNER. VIOLENCE MORE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS DATING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN SURVEY. 80% OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE WITHIN THEIR LIFETIMES. WITH TRADITIONAL COLLEGE AGED WOMEN. BEING 11% MORE LIKELY TOOK OF VIOLENCE. THIS IS JUST A GROWS ONE STUDENTS ARE ON COMMUTER HEAVY CAMPUSES LIKE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. CURRENTLY FEDERAL AND STATE LAW REQUIRES. COLLEGE CAMPUSES AS PART OF THE ORIENTATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAMMING TO DISCUSS ISSUES RELATING TO SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. AB THREE EIGHTY ONE EXPANDS ON THESE PROVISIONS ARE REQUIRES THAT PROGRAMMING INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION ABOUT INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND RELEVANT RESOURCES ON CAMPUSES AS WELL AS CREATION OF MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING WITH LOCAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CENTERS. WHEN FEASIBLE INCORPORATING EDUCATION ON THE WARNING SIGNS OF DATING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE? TRAINING ON THE PREVENTION OF DATING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND COMMUNICATION ON CAMPUS. ABOUT RESOURCES LAWS IMPULSES POLICIES WHICH IMPACT AND CAN BE UTILIZED BY THE STUDENTS WILL HELP GIVE STUDENTS AN ARRAY OF TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO COMBAT. THE HIGH RATES OF INTERPERSONAL DATING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITH ME TODAY. ARE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT SENATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUTER COLLEGES IS DANNY THERE ARE COOL. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES. MY NAME IS DANNY TERKEL I'M THE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR OF REGION TO IN SACRAMENTO FOR THE STUDENTS HAVE A CALIFORNIA COMEY COLLEGE. I ALSO SERVICED INTERESTED PHILOSOPHY IS GOING TO COLLEGE DISTRICT. STUDENTS SENT FOR CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CULTURE SUPPORTED THIS IN A ROW AND WE THINK THE OFFER FOR COMMITMENT ON THE ISSUE. THE REALITY WE'RE FACING IS. TO MANY STUDENTS PARTICULARLY ON A COMMUTER HEAVY CAMPUSES IN THE COMMUNITY CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE SYSTEM. OUR VICTIMS OR SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE TOO MANY STUDENTS FIND THEMSELVES IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND ARE UNCERTAIN OF WHERE TO FINALLY SCISSORS RESOURCES FOR HELP OR EVEN HOW TO IDENTIFY. THAT THE RELATIONSHIP THEY ARE IN AS ABUSIVE ALSO MENTAL IMPACT. INDIVIDUALS IN A LONG TERM ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. MIGHT BELIEVE THAT THEY DESERVE ABUSE FOR ANY SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS WRONG. BUT THEY DID NOTHING WRONG AND NO ONE DESERVES ANY KIND OF ABUSE. MANY DO NOT LEAVE BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED. AND SOME THAT DO WANT TO LEAVE DON'T KNOW THE FIRST STEP TO TAKE IN ORDER TO LEAVE SAFELY. WITHOUT PROPER KNOWLEDGE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL AND OVERALL MANIPULATION BY AN AGGRESSOR CONTINUES AND COUNTLESS OF STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO STAY SILENT. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL AS A MATTER SAFETY FOR STUDENTS ENSURING THAT CAMPUSES. WHEN HAVING ORIENTATION PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON SEXUAL SO EDUCATION INCLUDE INFORMATIVE PROGRAMS? OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. INCLUDE PROGRAMS ON DATING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS IMPERATIVE PIECE OF COMBATING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. AS FOR THESE REASONS AT THE STUDENT CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB THREE EIGHTY ONE AND RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU'RE ABLE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU'D COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE AND SAY YOU GET YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT. GOOD AFTERNOON CUSTOMS A CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TEND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. I ALLEYS AGO WITH OF MACINNES ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY WINNERS.

ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'LL SEE NONE -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AS CHAIR OF THE HIGHER ED COMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS UNDERSTAND. AS WHEN THEY COME IN -- THE PARAMETERS AND AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ORIENTATION -- AT AS THEY COME IN A TO BEGIN. A COLLEGE SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AS I SUPPORTED TWENTY SEVENTY LAST YEAR WHEN I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU. AS THE MOVE AS THE BILL MOVES. FOR WE HAVE A FIRST BY MISTER LOWE A SECOND BY DOCTOR WEBER. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE CHOI. CHOI I MURATSUCHI. MURATSUCHI I BLOOM. GABRIELLA [inaudible] BLOOM I GABRIEL -- DAILY. DALY I KILEY. LEVINE. LEVINE I LOW LOW I PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER. WEBER I EIGHT ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER NOW THAT THE NEXT THE BILL ITEM NUMBER. SIX MISS GONZALEZ [inaudible] FLETCHER. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB FIVE HUNDRED I'VE BROUGHT BACK FROM LAST YEAR WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS% CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO PROVIDE CERTIFIED ACADEMIC AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. AT LEAST SIX WEEKS OF FULLY PAID LEAVE DUE TO PREGNANCY MISCARRIAGE CHILDBIRTH RECOVERY. TAKE PREGNANCY RELATED LEAVE OF ABSENCE CURRENT LAW FORCES SCHOOL AN ACADEMIC EMPLOYEES EXHAUST ALL ACCRUED LEAVE INCLUDING PAID SICK LEAVE AND VACATION TIME. BEFORE THEY CAN RECEIVE ONLY DIFFERENTIAL PAY AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INCOME IS LEFT FOR THE EMPLOYEE AFTER THE DISTRICT HAS PAID FIRST SUBSTITUTE POSITION. AND WE'RE PERSONS OVER 70% FEMALE THIS POLICY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO HAVE CHILDREN. FORCES THEM TO DEPLETE ANY PAID LEAVE THEY'VE ACCRUED AND WE KNOW THAT PAID LEAVE IS VERY IMPORTANT ONCE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THAT CHILD. AND SACRIFICE THEIR FINANCIAL SECURITY IN ORDER TAKE NEXT. I REDUCES BILL BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THAT PUTTING YOUNG WOMEN IN A POSITION WHERE THEY MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN SCHEDULING PREGNANCIES BASED ON ACADEMIC YOUR CALENDAR WAITING YEARS TO HAVE CHILDREN UNTIL THEY'VE SAVED ENOUGH SICK LEAVE. OR TEMPING TO SURVIVE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PAY IS NOT ACCEPTABLE OR SUSTAINABLE RESEARCH INDICATES THAT IF THE STATE COULD CUT THE TURNOVER RATE FOR TEACHERS AND HALF THE TEACHER SHORTAGE WOULD BE LARGELY ELIMINATED THIS IS ONE STEP IN. DOING THAT SCHOOLS IN COMEY COLLEGES CAN HELP ENSURE EMPLOYEES ARE SO INCENTIVIZE TO REMAIN IN THE PROFESSION. ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY'VE HAD CHILDREN BY INVESTING IN NECESSARY BENEFITS THAT MAKE IT LESS BURDENSOME FOR YOUNG WOMEN TO START A FAMILY. AB FIVE HUNDRED WHAT ALSO HELP ENSURE THE THAT'S POSSIBLE BY SIMPLY REQUIRING SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOL DEGREE COLLEGES REVISED EMPLOYEES WITH AT LEAST SIX WEEKS OF PAID PREGNANCY LEAVE WHICH THEY CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE. HAVE A NUMBER OF WITNESSES HERE TO TESTIFY. ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS GAIL PIPPEN I'MA PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR AND PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. CFT APPLAUDS ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ FOR OFFERING AB FIVE HUNDRED THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS SO MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF. I'D LIKE TO SHARE MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN TIGHT TO WHY WE NEED AB FIVE HUNDRED TO BE SIGNED INTO LAW. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I'M SORRY. JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I GAVE BIRTH TO MY FIRST AND ONLY CHILD MY EMPLOYER THE LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT GRANTS ONE DAY. OF PAID LEAVE FOR CHILDBIRTH. UNLIKE PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES MOST FACULTY LIKE MYSELF ARE NOT COVERED BY STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE AND THAT'S TO NOT RECEIVE ANY TYPE OF PAID LEAVE UNDER THAT PROGRAM. I CHOSE TO TAKE THE ENTIRE SEMESTER OFF BUT THE ONLY WAY I COULD DO THAT WAS TO TAKE UNPAID LEAVE AND TO LOSE A STEP IN MY SALARY ADVANCEMENT. THOSE WERE SACRIFICES I WAS WILLING TO MAKE AND RECOVER BUT COST. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES GAVE BIRTH TOOK HER ONE DAY OF PAID LEAVE AND RETURN TO WORK. ANOTHER COLLEAGUE HAD A BABY TOOK UNPAID LEAVE AND DECIDED NOT TO RETURN STILL ANOTHER COLLEGE PROBABLY QUIT TEACHING AS AN ADJUNCT INSTRUCTOR AFTER HAVING HER SECOND CHILD. THEN WAS NEVER ABLE TO REENTER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORK FORCE. THESE EXAMPLES ALONE DEMONSTRATE THE DISCRIMINATORY NATURE OF ARE CURRENTLY POLICIES FOR CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS. WE LIVE IN THE US ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED NATIONS IN THE WORLD AND YET THE US IS THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY AND ONE OF THREE COUNTRIES OVERALL. WITH NO PAID PARENTAL LEAVE THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR EDUCATIONAL WORK FORCE AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR STUDENTS. PARENTAL LEAVE INCREASES WORKPLACE LOYALTY AND CONTRIBUTES TO EMPLOYEE RETENTION CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEVE IT'S SAVE THE STATE MONEY. IMPROVES WORKPLACE PRODUCTIVITY WHICH MEANS WERE ABLE TO GIVE OUR BEST SELVES TO OUR STUDENTS AND LET'S NOT FORGET OUR CHILDREN OUR FUTURE. AND SUPPLYING THE BASICS FOR FAMILIES IT'S ONE OF THE BEST WAYS WE CAN GIVE OUR FUTURE COMMUNITY LEADERS A STRONG START IN LIFE. I WILL PERSONALLY BENEFIT FOR MAYBE FIVE HUNDRED BUT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS WELL CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE THE LEAD ON PULLING THE U. S. OUT OF THE BOTTOM INTERNATIONAL POSITION FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE. MORE OVER EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED WILL HELP KEEP VALUED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IN THE WORK FORCE AFTER HAVING CHILDREN AFTER HAVING CHILDREN AN END TO THE CURRENT CURRENT DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICE. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS VERONICA Là PASS I AM AN ATTRITION FACULTY AT AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TO THIS BILL. THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF A HANDFUL OF COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL PARENTAL PAID LEAVE POLICY WHEN A WOMAN IN THE U. S. GETS PREGNANT SHE'S ENTITLED TO TWELVE WEEKS OF UNPAID LEAVE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS AFTER BIRTH. THANKS TO A CLINTON ERA A LOT KNOWN AS THE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT. BUT AMERICAN WOMEN ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY ENTITLED TO TWELVE FULLY PAID WEEKS OFF LIKE WOMEN IN MAY HE GO OR FORTY SIX FULLY PAID WEEKS OFF LIKE IN WOMEN IN BULGARIA. OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT NATIONAL PARENTAL PAID LEAVE INCLUDES WHAT YOU AND LESS THOUGH PULL BUT NEW GUINEA. THIS LACK OF POLICY ISN'T JUST INCONVENIENCE FOR AMERICAN WOMEN IN MANY CASES IT DETERMINES HOW WOMEN MAKE CRUCIAL CHOICES ABOUT THEIR HEALTH. THEIR FINANCES AND THEIR FAMILIES TEACHERS ARE HIT PARTICULARLY HARD BY THE SLACK BECAUSE ROUGHLY 75% OF PUBLIC TO SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE WOMEN. AND WE ARE GROSSLY UNDERPAID. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WEEKLY WAGES WERE ROUGHLY 17% LOWER THAN THOSE COMPATIBLE WORKERS ACCORDING TO THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE. LAST YEAR SOME PEOPLE TEACHERS IN NEW YORK GOT SOME GOOD NEWS AFTER A LONG BATTLE WITH NEW YORK CITY THE UNITED FEDERATION OF TEACHERS SUCCESSFULLY HELP IMPLEMENT A POLICY GIVING PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS. SIX WEEKS OF PAID PARENTAL LEAVE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATOR CALIFORNIA OFFERS ITS EMPLOYEES OF LEGISLATOR THE UC AND THE CSU SIX WEEKS OF PAID PARENTAL LEAVE. NEW YORK SAKE OFFERS ITS EMPLOYEES EIGHT WEEKS OF PAID PARENTAL LEAVE. NEW JERSEY PROGRAM OFFERS SIX WEEKS OF PAID LEAVE A BUT EMPLOYEES ARE PAID ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THEIR NORMAL PAYCHECKS. AUSTIN TEXAS IN PITTSBURGH ALSO OFFERS TEACHERS SIX WEEKS OF PAID PARENTAL LEAVE AS EVIDENCE SHOWS CALIFORNIA IS FALLING BEHIND WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE SHOULD DO BETTER. AB FIVE HUNDRED WILL HELP RETAIN VALUABLE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THIS IS AN INVESTMENT THAT OUR SCHOOLS MUST MAKE. THIS IS NOT A SUBSIDY I URGE YOU YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M GONNA CALL FOR A OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU GIVE YOUR NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION YOU'RE WITH. AS CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE PROP CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL.

QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MR CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBER GONZALEZ -- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. A FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE -- I'M THAT BY. A YEAR AGO I SON AND MY FIRST GRAND CHILD. AND JUST AFTER ONE YEAR. HE IS NOW BARELY -- YOU KNOW HIS CELL PHONE. CAPTION WALKING RUNNING ETCETERA AND THE FLOW OF SIX MONTHS. OF TIME. I THOUGHT THE PERSONALLY WAS SO UNNECESSARY AFTER TIES BUT THE FOR OF THE CHILDREN AND ALMOST A MONTH A MONTH THIS HOUSE A SELF. BUT HERE MINIMUM -- SIX WEEKS OF LEAVE. AFTER BIRTH THIS IS I THINK THAT THAT'S A BABY STEP FUNDING. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS SO -- SOMETHING WE CAN OR SUPPORT. AND THEN I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. SHE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- MS GONZALEZ WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE ABOUT. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IN THE BILL FORWARD. AND AS I SUPPORTED -- YOUR ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SIXTY EIGHT TWO YEARS AGO I'M AGAIN PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AS A MATTER OF EQUITY. SO IF I COULD HAVE A MOTION -- BY DOCTOR WEBER SECOND BY MISTER LOW. AND MADAM SECRETARY BE GOOD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. MEDINA HI MEDINA I CHOI AYE CHOI AYE MURATSUCHI. MURATSUCHI I BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I DALY. DALY I KILEY. LEVINE. LEVINE I LOW LOW I PATTERSON. PATTERSON I SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO I WEBER. WEBER HI. ELEVEN ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT. I WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. NEXT ITEM -- NUMBER. TWO AB. ONE FIFTY FOUR OF MISTER VOEPEL THANK YOU [inaudible] CHAIR [inaudible] AND MY ILLUSTRIOUS AND HONORED COLLEAGUES. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB ONE FIFTY FOUR WHICH ESTABLISHES A STUDENT. FINANCIAL AID PILOT PROGRAM TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN INCOME CHAIR AGREEMENT AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR STUDENTS EARNING THEIR BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN ARE UC AND CSU SYSTEM COMMENCING BUT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEAR. UNDER AND I ESSAY IN COME CHAIR AGREEMENT PRIVATE INVESTORS FUND STUDENTS IN RETURN FOR A SHARE OF THEIR INCOME OVER FIX PERIODS OF TIME. PURDUE UNIVERSITY HAS IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS AS A WAY TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION TO MOUNTING DEBT. AND IT'S HELPED OVER FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE CS USED TO TAKE ASK. IN I PUT EMPHASIS ON BIG IN A WHIMPERING. ASK UC'S TO PARTICIPATE PARTICIPATION WILL BE BASED ON THE LEVEL OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT WHILE THE STATE WOULD FUND THE UP FRONT COST OF THE INITIAL PROGRAM. WELL THE MIX OF FEDERAL AND STATE GRANTS IS AVAILABLE FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES THE AMOUNT IS FREQUENTLY IN SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF ATTENDANCE. THESE STUDENTS MUST OFTEN TAKE OUT LOANS TO BRIDGE THE FUNDING GAP UNLIKE PRIVATE OR STUDENT LOANS THERE IS NO INTEREST CHARGED WITH AYE ESSAYS IT'S KINDA NEAT THAT WAY. INCOME SHARE AGREEMENTS PROVIDE ANOTHER FINANCING OPTIONS TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE MONETARY BURDEN ON STUDENTS EARNING A BACHELOR'S DEGREES. THE INSURER THE I. SA MONTHLY PAYMENTS ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDING TO THE STUDENTS POSTGRADUATE INCOME AND DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL THE STUDENTS EMPLOYED EARNING THE MINIMUM SALARY REQUIREMENT OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THE AVERAGE. LOAN THAT A STUDENT KERRY'S WHEN THEY GRADUATE IS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS A NEAT PROGRAM I APPRECIATE. THE DEDICATION THE CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGE STUDENTS ESPECIALLY BY THIS COMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE CASEY JENNINGS WITH THE THIRTEENTH AVENUE FUNDING TO TELL YOU MORE IN REGARDS TO THE PROGRAM. AND WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM. THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S CASEY JENNINGS. I'M THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA NOT FOR PROFIT THIRTEENTH AVENUE FUNDING. WE STARTED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO TO FOCUS ON INCOME SHARE AGREEMENTS. WE WERE ADVISERS TO PRODUCE UNIVERSITIES PROGRAM. WITH ADVISED A COUPLE OTHER PROGRAMS. WE'VE TALKED TO INVESTORS WE'VE TALKED TO COLLEGES WE TALK TO TEACHERS WE TALKED TO A LOT OF STUDENTS. PRIOR TO THIS WORK I SPENT THIRTY YEARS BASICALLY ON WALL STREET CREATING STRUCTURED FINANCE PRODUCTS. I GOT INVOLVED IN AYE ESSAYS BECAUSE I NOTICES STUDENTS WERE BORROWING MORE. MUCH MORE. BUT THE OUTCOMES WERE NOT GETTING BETTER. AND THE RISK OF THAT INCREASED BORROWING WAS BEING BORNE BY THE STUDENTS. IN MY FORMER CAREER HAVING THE WEAKEST PARTY IN A TRANSACTION BEAR ALL THE RISK WAS ALWAYS THE WRONG DEAL. THOSE DEALS BLOW UP THEIR HARM EVERYBODY INVOLVED WITH THEM. THAT'S OUR STUDENT LOAN SYSTEM IS IS WHAT IS HEADING. FOR IT'S PRETTY FAR DOWN THAT ROAD.% THE ISSUE A STERN DOES A CURLY STRUCTURED IS THAT DEBT BEING BORNE BY THE WEAKEST PARTY THE STUDENTS THE FALL RATES RISE STUDENTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PAY. AND THE TAXPAYERS GONNA WRITE THE CHECK. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. I ESSAYS OFFER THE POTENTIAL. TO MOVE SOME OF THAT ROSE FROM THE STUDENTS TO A PARTY BETTER ABLE TO BEAR THAT RISK. BUT I WANT TO KEEP IN MIND I SAID POTENTIAL. THERE ARE GOOD I SAY IS THERE ARE ABOUT. SIX I WANT TO TURN TO THE LETTER FROM THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. SOME OF THE DETAILS CONCERNING IOS IS NOT LETTER INCORRECT. I DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT. I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE ON SAID ASSUMPTION LETTER. THE LETTER ASSUMES THAT AYE ESSAYS ARE NOT ALREADY AVAILABLE. IN CURRENTLY BEING USED BY CSU STUDENTS. BUT THEY ARE BEING USED. THAT SCALE. MY CURRENT STUDENTS BY RECENT GRADUATES AND BY POTENTIAL STUDENTS. FOR WHOM GOING TO COLLEGE PROPOSES TO MUCH FINANCIAL RISK. SO WHERE THEY USING THOSE MOST IN ARE USING AN PURSUE CERTIFICATES FROM PROGRAMMING BOOT CAMPS. I'M SURE USING THE ADS ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE PROGRAMMING BOOT CAMPS THE I'D STATES IN CALIFORNIA. A GOOD PORTION OF THOSE BOOT CAMPS ARE FUNDED BY THE STUDENTS SIGNING ISA'S. THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT THERE'S NO REGULATION THERE'S NO OFFERING IN FACT. UC SAN DIEGO'S EXTENSION PROGRAM IS ENTERED A JOINT VENTURE WITH A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GROUP IN SAN DIEGO. IT'S GOING TO KICK OFF IN JULY WITH ITS FIRST CLASS AND THE STUDENTS HAVE THE OPTION OF SIGNING INTO INCOME SHARE AGREEMENTS. SO BETWEEN THE BOOT CAMPS. THE UC EXTENSION AND ALL THE PROGRAMS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. THESE ARE ALREADY OUT THERE SO I RESPECT THE FACT RECESS ASIAN. BUT HAVING SEE IF YOU SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM [inaudible] SO. I THINK THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TRANSFER RISK. BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S UNCLEAR THAT'S HAPPENING. THE REASON WHY ORGANIZATION SUPPORTS THIS BILL. IS BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER HAVE CSU AND UC SPONSOR AYE ESSAYS THAN THE CURRENT FRAME. WE THINK THERE HAVE GOOD FOR THE HAVE IMPROVED DISCLOSURE INCREASED CHANCE PARENTING BETTER TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE STUDENT. FOR AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT PROBABLY A LOT OF DISCUSSION. NONE OF THAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING WITH AYE ESSAYS IN CALIFORNIA. A WELL STRUCTURED I ESSAY WILL TRANSFER THE MAJORITY OF THE RISK. FROM THE POOL OF STUDENTS TO THIRD PARTIES. HAVING THIS LEGISLATURE FUND A PILOT PROGRAM WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED A BETTER I SAY TO CALIFORNIANS. HAND SINCE I'M FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- FOR THIRTY STAND OF THE OTHER PROVIDERS WILL HAVE TO UP THEIR GAME. BECAUSE THIS WILL BECOME THE BENCHMARK PRODUCT THIS WEEK ON WHAT STUDENTS WILL LOOK AT AND THEY'LL HAVE SOME TRANSFERRED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A GOOD I SAY IS FROM A BAD I SAY. SO. IF WE DO NOTHING. CRITICIZED THE EXISTING SYSTEM IS JUST FINE. THEN WE WON'T HAVE THAT WON'T HAPPEN. AND THE STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BEAR RISK. AND WE WON'T SEE. THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SAY THANKS FOR YOUR TIME I'LL STOP AND TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. AND BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I'D LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR IF HE ACCEPTS THE AMENDMENTS. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THREE NINE ANY WITNESSES AGAINST. MR MEMBERS ANDREW ANTS WE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION -- WE'VE BEEN ON RECORD WITH OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS PROPOSAL -- WHERE TO STAND THE GOOD INTENTIONS AND FRANKLY THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR REFINING THE BILL? BUT THE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF HAVING PRIVATE INVESTORS PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF FINANCIAL AID IT'S NOT A BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO PUBLICLY FUNDED FINANCIALLY. AND IT COULD BE A PATHWAY TOWARDS WAY SO HERE IS QUESTIONABLE. AND WE'RE CONCERNED BECAUSE OF STUDENTS ARE DESPERATE TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION WE REALLY BELIEVE OF THE AUTHOR IN A SPONSOR -- HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS HERE BUT WE THINK THAT EVEN WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEES MADE. OF THE BETTER ALTERNATIVE IS TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID. AND WE'D RATHER SEE A STUDENT GOING DOWN THAT PATHWAY. THEN. MAKE THEMSELVES YOU KNOW AVAILABLE TO THIS KIND OF A SITUATION WHERE THEIR FUTURE INCOME AFTER THEY LEAVE FROM THE UNIVERSITY NOT NECESSARILY GRADUATE -- HAVE THEIR WAY JUST GARDENERS. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE CONTINUE TO RETAIN OPPOSITION NOT WITHSTANDING THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR JUST ACCEPTED THANK YOU [inaudible] THE WINNERS. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER MURATSUCHI. SO THANK YOU WELL -- FOR THE PRESENTATION AND MISTER AND TO BE. FOR THE CIP FACE POSITION I I I I I I GUESS SAY OF IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S IT'S PROVIDING A AN OPTION. FOR STUDENTS IN ADDITION TO FINANCIAL AID AND SO IT'S NOT A LITTLE FINANCIAL AID -- BY. I GUESS I CAN'T SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND. WHY SEE IF THEY WOULD BE OPPOSED TO IT OTHER THAN THE? GENERAL PHILOSOPHY OF WEIGHTS GARDEN GARNISHMENT MAN IT IT IT IT SEEMS LIKE. THIS WOULD HAVE THE YOU KNOW IT STUDENTS AND A UNIVERSITIES HAVE THE OPTION OF OF DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM LOTS OF DIFFERENT. FINANCIAL. TOOLS YOU KNOW COMING BEFORE STUDENTS SPECIALLY IN THERE IN A COLLEGE YEARS. AND MANY OF THEM AT THE TIME ARE SEEN AS OPTIONS AND SOME PEOPLE INCLUDING ME -- TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THOSE AND THEN LATER ON REGRETTED THEM OR HAD TO PAY A HIGHER PRICE ON THEM -- THIS IS INNOVATIVE IN THE IDEA OF ACCORDING TO SPONSORS NO INTEREST ON IT. BUT WE THINK THAT IF THE UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO EXPERIMENT WITH PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS. BUT IT BETTER BE DONE WITH PUBLIC RESOURCES AND NOT WITH. RULES THAT ARE BACKED BY PRIVATE INVESTORS. SO AS PART OF THE CONCERN THAT WOULD THAT WOULD -- WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS INVOLVES STATE FUNDS TO YOUR THE PLANET AND WE'D RATHER SEE THE BUDGET THE PUBLIC BUDGET. FOR FINANCIAL AID GROHL. AT MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR FOLKS WHO WHO NEEDED. FOR A LOW THIS IS NOT REPLACING FINANCIALLY BUT IT'S IN ADDITION. TO THIS WE GET WE'D LIKE OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO THIS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS HERE MISTER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR OF I'M ALSO A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED TO HEAR OR OPPOSITION -- OPINION -- YOU -- INTERPRET THIS ONE AS SAW. BURDEN OF FOR THE GRADUATE -- S. SELLECK A WAGE GARNISHMENT. BUT YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THE MANY STUDENTS TO DO GRADUATE. WITH THE TO SHOW AND THAT'S AND THE MOST OF THEM DON'T CARRY HIGH INTEREST. AND THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY. REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME. AFTER A CERTAIN -- NUMBER OF WHAT MINE SO FOR YEARS. AND THEN ALSO -- THE INCOME BASED -- OUT A PAYMENT PLAN HAS TO BE WORKED OUT THE HOW MUCH THE PERSON CAN PAY AND ALL FOR WHAT THE KERRIER. SO THIS IS -- NOT -- MANDATING ANYBODY IT WOULD BE MORE OF USING. A PRIVATE FUND. A COMPANY WILL INVEST. ON A STUDENT -- BETTING IT. IN A DOOR SO TAKING A RISK. WHAT THE THE PERSON THAT WOULD HAVE A WINNING POTENTIAL? AND THE PUTTING MY MONEY IF I WAS TO INVESTOR. AND THEN -- OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD. AND THE THAT THE SOUTHERN PORTION WHATEVER COMFORTABLE. UNDER THE AGREEMENT TOUGH I INCOME SHARE THE AGREEMENT HOW MUCH. LIFE IT -- FEEL COMFORTABLE TO PAY BACK UP A MONTH. A COULD BE 5% COULD BE 10% WHICH YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE. SO THIS IS -- AND THE NEW. FOR STUDENTS -- TO FIND -- THE TUITION MECHANISM. A COULD BE A GRANT COULD BE DEBT. COULD BE OUR STATE THAT THE WHAT FEDERAL DEBT THE WALL GROUP COULD BE THAT PERSONAL DATA. THIS ONE IS A UNIFORM IT IT IT IT IS SAID THAT THE HOWEVER. UP AN INVESTOR IS THE BEDDING ON YOU HEY YOU IT YOU ARE COULD THINK TO YOUR THEN I'M GONNA BAD ON YOU. AND STUDY HOT AND THE INVESTING IN NEW SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE. SO -- THAT'S MY IN A KINDA. REFLECTIVE A COMMENT UP ON YOUR QUESTION BUT I DO HAVE A SOME QUESTION TO THE OR SO MAYBE -- AND ON WITNESS -- BUT DO UNIVERSITY YOU MENTIONED THAT. AND THE OTHER THAN PUT THROUGH. WHAT ARE THE COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES? HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM HOW LONG AND THE WHAT THE SUCCESS RATE IS. AND I'M GONNA NUMBER B	C COMPANIES. INVOLVED. IS A ONE COMPANY IS TO A BETTING ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS ALL HUNDRED COMPANIES -- SUPPORTING HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND THEN ALSO. WHAT THE MAJORS -- FOR EXAMPLE ENGINEERS SO COMPUTER SCIENCE SO MAY BE OF MORE. IN ALL. THE PROMISING AND THE COMPANIES TO MAKE -- ALL ON THE ENGINEERING SCIENCE -- NOT NOT A HUMANITIES SO SO SOURCE THIS THERE IS A SUCH ARE THE SO MY YOU KNOW. IF YOU HAVE ANY SUCH SUCH A DATA SURE AND THE MOST -- SECOND QUESTION IS -- WHAT IF WHAT IF THE STUDENT -- WAS NOT A GOOD BET AND THAT DIDN'T [inaudible] FINISH. AND I COULDN'T GRADUATE AND MY MONEY THAT I INVESTED. WELL TWO YEARS SO WILL BE WASTED. AND WHAT KIND OF A RESOURCE THAT MEAN THAT REQUEST OF WHAT DO I HAVE. SO THOSE OF MY QUESTIONS IF YOU CASH YOUR TO PRODUCE THE ONLY MAJOR SYSTEM UNIVERSITY AND IN PART DUE IS. PART OF THE UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA SYSTEM IT'S NOT A PRIVATE INSTITUTION. PRODUCERS SYSTEM DIRECTOR AND WE IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO PUT RIVER WORKING WITH PRETTY ON SITE FOR ABOUT ELEVEN MONTHS. SO IT IT'S NOT A FAST PROGRAM TO STAND UP [inaudible] ON PRODUCES A COUPLE THINGS MITCH DANIELS IS THE PRESIDENT PURDUE UNIVERSITY FORMER GOVERNOR OF INDIANA. SO A LOT OF THIS BOOK THE WAY MITCH WANTED TO WORK. THE PROGRAM AT PURDUE IS SET UP SO THE LIGHT START WITH EXTEND IT EXPECTATIONS OF INCOME. AND THEN YOU ADJUST. THE TIME OF THE OBLIGATION THE PERCENTAGE TO GET ROUGHLY SIMILAR RETURNS TO THE FOR DOING DOWN THEY WERE THE ONES THAT INITIALLY FUND. THE FIRST YEAR OF A HUNDRED AND FOR STUDENTS SIGNED UP. SECOND YEAR I THINK THEY HAD A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR AND THE LAST NEWS I GOT THE OTHER DAYS ARE UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY NOW. SOUTH. ON EXPLICITLY FOCUS NOT ON TRYING TO REPLACE THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN STAFFERS OR NON THEY FOCUSED ON A LOT OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS AND PURDUE BLOW THROUGH THEIR FEDERAL LIMóN. THEY HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER SOURCE FOR MONEY PRODUCER TO REPLACE THE PARENT PLUS LOANS IN THE PRIVATE LOANS FOR STUDENTS THAT BLOW THROUGH THAT LIMóN. SO THAT WAS THE IDEA PRODUCE. TARGETED RETURN. YOU COULD HAVE TO THINK OF THERE'S LEVERAGE HERE YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE STRUCTURE PRODUCED TARGETED RETURN FOR THE WHOLE POOL IS 9% BEFORE WRITE OFFS IN ABOUT SEVEN POINT SIX AFTER WRITE OFFS. SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST SYSTEM SCHOOLS THAT HAVE LOOKED AT THIS AND ARE LOOKING AT THIS. THERE IS A BUNCH OF SMALL UNIVERSITIES OUT THERE WE'VE SPOKEN TO THEM. THE CITY UNIVERSITY SYSTEM NEW YORK IS LOOKING AT THE STILL THE BILL AGAIN FOR AWHILE. THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN NEW YORK IS LOOKING AT THEM -- THE TEXAS COMMON FUNDERS LOOKING TO INVEST. THE TEXAS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IS LOOKING UP. AND THERE'S PROBABLY A BUNCH OF OTHER CONVERSATIONS GOING ON THEY TEND TO POP UP AND GO DOWN. I'LL ALSO TELL YOU EXPLICITLY. LOTS OF UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS LIKE THE IDEA AS LONG AS THEY DON'T HAVE TO FUND. TO THE PEARLY HAVING SOMEONE ELSE FUNDS THAT. BUT THERE DEVELOPMENT OFFICER ISRAEL'S IS NOT INTERESTED IN WRITING THE CHECK BECAUSE THEY WANT. TO WRITE CHECKS FOR OTHER THINGS WE GET THAT PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED PRETTY RISKY WAS FUNDED INITIALLY BY THE ENDOWMENT. AND THEN THE EXISTENTIALLY SOLD DOWN SOME OF THEIR POSITION TO TO CHARITIES BASED IN INDIA. I'M NOT AWARE. THE PRODUCES A TAKEN ANY. I JUST ACTUALLY. I'M NOT A NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. HE WAS TAKING MONEY FROM TO CORPORATIONS IN INDIANA THAT ARE INTERESTED IN PARTICULAR CITY AND THEY FUNDED AN EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN. IN SORT OF THE MID SINGLE DIGITS. I GOT ALL I CAN SAY HERE TODAY. ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF FUNDING AYE ESSAYS HAS TYPICALLY FUNDED THEM OUT OF THE MIX. OF CHERNOBYL GRANTS AND LORENA RETURNS THIS IS FOR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. FOR PRIVATE BOOT CAMPS FOR PROGRAMMING SORT OF PROGRAMS. THOSE RETURNS ARE TYPICALLY LOOKED IN THE MID TO HIGH TEENS NOT SORT OF ONE OF OUR ISSUES. IS INVESTORS ARE LOOKING TO MAKE AN ISSUE THAT PROBABLY FEEL HE GRAPPLE WITH THAT -- BUT ONLY FOR THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS AND FOR THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME THEY'RE NOT FOR PROFIT. WE SEE TYPICALLY SEEN TARGET AREAS TO RETURN FOR SIX OR 7%. SO. YES THERE'S NO INTEREST BUT BY MOVING THOSE LEVERS ABOUT EXPECTED INCOME WHAT'S THE DURATION OF THE CONTRACT WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME YOU CAN TARGET DIFFERENT RATES OF RETURN. QUESTION. IF I BUY INVESTED IN A STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY AS OPPOSED TO A POOL WHICH IS TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS AND THAT STUDENT. DROPPED OUT. IF THEIR INCOME NEVER EXCEEDS THE THRESHOLD YOU'RE GONNA MAKE NOTHING. IF THEY'RE EXCEEDING THREE INCOME EXCEEDS THE THRESHOLD A LITTLE BIT. YOU MAY MAKE A LITTLE BIT ARE YOU GONNA GET YOUR MONEY BACK. DEPENDS ON WHAT THE ASSUMPTION WAS THE LIKELY NOT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SHIFT RISK FROM STUDENTS. WHO MAY NOT STAND THERE MAJOR WHO MAY NOT GET EMPLOYED WHOM MAY HAVE TO GO HOME AND TAKE CARE OF A PARENT? WHO MAY HAVE TO MOVE BACK TO FOR THE COUNTRY WITH THE INCOME IS IN HIGH IS TO HAVE THAT RICHARD REID RETURN THOSE PAYMENTS AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST? HAS THEIR INCOME ADJUST AND IF THEY'RE OUT OF WORK. IT TURNS OFF. UNLIKE. THE FEDERAL ID OUR PROGRAM WHICH IS A NICE IDEA BUT HORRIBLY MISTREATED UNLIKE PRIVATE LOANS UNLIKE PARENT PLUS. I DON'T THINK IT'S A PERFECT SOLUTION I JUST THINK IT CAN BE CAN BE BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER ONES OUT THERE. EDIT YOUR QUESTION. YEP BUT THE IF. THE HOW HOW LONG IT -- DID A DID TO PUT BUT TO BEGIN THIS PROGRAM. FOUR YEARS AGO FOUR YEARS FOUR YEARS AGO. SO THERE AND THEY STARTED WITH SENIORS WHO GRADUATED MIDDLE FOR YEARS SO WILL BEGIN TO SEE THE GRADUATES WELL SO THE INTERESTING PART IS. A FAIR NUMBER PRODUCES INITIAL GROUP WENT ON TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. SO THE AGREEMENT IS ESSENTIALLY IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION WHICH OF ONE OF OUR AMENDMENTS. WHAT THE STUDENTS ARE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL? AND THEN IT STARTS ONCE THEY GET WHICH ARE NO LONGER IN FULL TIME SCHOOL. WHICH THE FEDERAL ONE DOES THE PRIVATE LOANS ARE LESS CONTROL THAT WAY. IT'S SORT OF EMBEDS A BUNCH OF FLEXIBILITY. CELL AND PRETTY COLORS SEVEN SAID. SO HOW IS THIS GOING TO AFFECT OUR RETURN I SAID THE FACT THE GREATER AND SO MUCH MORE AFTER THEY GET THEIR GRADUATE DEGREE. YOU'LL PROBABLY DO BETTER SO IT WOULD BE ON A BIT TOO EARLY TO SEE THE WHETHER IT AND THERE'S NO NEED A DATE OF WERE AVAILABLE AND AND PRODUCED PROGRAM. IF YOU'RE IN ONE OF THE STEM FIELDS OF YOUR COMPUTER PROGRAMMING MAJOR JUST FOR EXAMPLE PRODUCE. THE OBLIGATION EXTENDS FOR EIGHTY FOUR MONTHS. AND IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE IF YOU'RE IN THEIR LOWEST EARNING MAJOR JUST FORESTRY. IT'S A HUNDRED FOURTEEN MONTHS AND IT'S PLEASE LIKE SEVEN POINT WE ADVISE FOR YOU NOT TO DO THAT WE SAID ONE DOES HAVE ONE PROGRAM FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM. AND THIS GUY NAY MITCH DANIELS SAID NOW OUR TRYING TO SEND A STRONGER SIGNAL ABOUT WHAT YOU TO MAJOR IN. WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THAT THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO DO IT -- MR GABRIEL THANK YOU THINK THINK THINK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ME FOR THIS MEASURE I THINK IT'S ALWAYS WORTH. THINKING ABOUT NEW -- STRATEGIES FOR EDUCATION FINANCE AND OPENING UP THE DOORS OF OF COLLEGE MORE FOLKS. I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED ABOUT THIS -- IN IN MAYBE NOT TRADE UNDERSTAND IT I THINK WITH A LOT OF THESE THINGS THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS HERE. I'M SORRY THESE PERCENTAGES CALCULATORS ICING THERE SOME FINANCIAL MODELING ACTUARIES ARE INVOLVED IN SO I GUESS MY QUESTIONS THERE ARE. IF THAT MODELING IS OFFICE WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW FOLKS INSTRUCTION FINANCE CAN BE AWFULLY SO THAT A LITTLE BIT DURING THE THE LAST -- GREAT RECESSION -- IS THE TAXPAYER ON THE HOOK FOR THAT OR THE UNIVERSITY AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS THIS GOING TO CREATE. INCENTIVES FOR UNIVERSITIES TO STEER STUDENTS INTO CERTAIN PROFESSIONS MAYBE AWAY WILL AWAY FROM THINGS LIKE THE PEACE CORPS IN TOWARDS THINGS LIKE INVESTMENT BANKING SO. THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAME TO MIND FOR ME. SOBERING TRY TO UNDO THE REVERSE ORDER TO THE FROM MY BRAIN WORKS. SO IN PART OF THE IN TERMS OF THE PEACE CORPS IN TERMS OF RELIGIOUS WORK IN TERMS OTHER STUFF LIKE THAT. THE I. SA IS TIED INCOME IF THEY'RE NOT MAKING INCOME THERE'S ACTUALLY BURNING OFF YEARS OBLIGATION. DEPENDING ON HOW THE CONTRACTS WRITTEN SO ACTUALLY. ONE OF PURDUE'S CONCERNS ON THE IN DOWNSIDE WAS THAT MORE STUDENTS WHEN IN FACT ELECTED JOINING THE PEACE CORPS. FOREGO WORK IN RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS AND THAT ACTUALLY WENT UP SO ACTUALLY GETS BETTER FLEXIBILITY FOR DOING. PUBLIC WORK WE IT GETS BETTER FLEXIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING AM DES WHO WANT TO GO WORK IN. THIRD WORLD COUNTRY IT MEDIA LEE CLICK ST AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR STUDENT LOAN ACCRUING COME BACK. IT BURNS OFTEN PRODUCE ACHES THE HIT. THE TAXPAYERS ARE ON THE HOOK THE MINI SHOWS UP DAY ONE FROM THE FUNDING SOURCE THE ENDOWMENT THE FIVE ONE TWO THREES OR THE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE WILLING TO EMBARK. ON THAT PROGRAM SO TAXPAYERS NEVER ON THE HOOK FOR THAT SORT OF THING WHICH IS TO BE A HUGE FEATURE -- WAS THE OTHER QUESTION I MEAN I I GUESS JUST ON THE PART ABOUT THE TAX FOR NEVER BEING ON THE HOOK ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS A PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT SO. IF IF THE FINANCIAL MODELING IS OFF AND THE IN DOWNEY THE UNIVERSITY ENDS UP TAKING AHEAD I MEAN THAT'S GOING TO BE TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PUBLIC AND IF FOR WORKING WITH A CORPORATION IT ASSUMES THAT THAT CORPORATION THAT'S WORKING WITH UNIVERSITIES ADEQUATELY FUNDED BY FLETCHER SAY THAT. THE BECAUSE THE MONEY SHOWS UP DAY. ONE SO IF SO AS LONG AS THE CHECK SHOWS UP YOUR FREEDOM CARE ABOUT THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF THE PEOPLE GAVE YOU THE CHECK BECAUSE YOU GOT THE CHECK. AND YOU PAY THE TUITION TO THE UC OR CSU. SO SO THAT KIDS THE CREDIT BURDEN. ONCE YOU CASH THE CHECK YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THEIR CREDIT WORTHINESS TO THE EXTENT THAT IS FROM THE ENDOWMENT OF YOU SEE OR CSU YEAH YOUR BUT THE WEIRD PART ABOUT AYE ESSAYS. MUCH MORE THAN DEBT. WHICH IS SORT OF THIS IS THAT BOBBY REPROOF IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT A DEBT CONTRACT LOOKS LIKE. YOUR BEST TODAY WITH A DEAD INVESTORS THE DAY YOU BOOK IT. AND THEN WITH YOUR BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT DO YOU LONG TO MONITOR THINGS DON'T PERFORM IT SLOWLY GOES SOUTH. WITH AN AYE A SAY YEAH YOU HAVE SOME THE GO SOUTH. AND USE ON THE GO NORTH. AND SO THE VARIANCE ON A BIG POOL OF I SAY CONTRACTS LIKE IF WE GET EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA. IT DOESN'T MOVE MUCH AT ALL EVEN IN THE GREAT RECESSION WE WENT THROUGH LOOKING AT LOW INCOME LOW WELL STUDENTS. HISPANICS TWENTY FIVE YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF DATA. THEIR TOTAL INCOME OF THAT LOW INCOME GROUP IN THE GREAT RECESSION DROP 6% FOR TWO YEARS AND THEN CAME BACK. IT IS BACK TO WHERE WE EXPECTED. YOU KNOW SO THE RISK WITH A FULL RSA'S IS MUCH BETTER THAN WITH A FULL OF LOOKS. AND THE POINT IS STUDENTS TO MAKE MORE WILL PAY MORE. AND FOR LOTS OF MIDDLE CLASS STUDENTS. THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE THAT BET THEY KNOW THEY'RE GONNA MAKE A TON OF MONEY. THEY DON'T NEED THE RESTRAINTS REALIZE SAY THEY'RE FINE. WE FOCUSED ON FOR STUDENTS LOW INCOME LOW WEALTH FIRST GENERATION. THEY GET WHAT FINANCIAL RISK YES THEY'VE GONE THROUGH. PLEASE SEE. AND FOR THEM A WELL STRUCTURED ONE I KEEP PUTTING ADDING TIME WHICH REMEMBER THAT. DOES DO RESTAURANTS FOR DOES GIVE MORE FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED. I'VE GONE TOO LONG START. YEAH I JUST I THANK YOU FOR THAT I I I APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU KNOW I GUESS I'M STILL WORKING MY MIND AROUND AROUND SOME OF THE STUFF AND AND I'D WANT ONE JUST FINAL QUESTION THEN I MAKE A COMMENT WHICH IS. SO IS THIS IS THE LEGISLATION IS WRITTEN NOW CONTEMPLATING THAT THE CSU WHEN YOU SEE WOULD ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH PRIVATE ENTITIES. FOR PROFIT PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT WOULD OPERATE THESE AYE SAYS I DON'T THINK SO. OKAY SO IT'S BUILT SPECIFICALLY BE GEARED TOWARDS FIVE OH ONE C. THREES NOW IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATION BASICALLY SAYS THE STATE'S GOING TO FUND THE PILOT AS I READ. WELCOME TO H. ONE PILOT AT ONE SEE ISSUE AND WHEN YOU SEE RIGHT OKAY. SO BUT SO SO THAT INITIAL AGAIN SO THAT MONEY THAT'S COMING IN FROM BUT THAT'S MONEY THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE TO BE ON THE HOOK. FOR ABSOLUTE OKAY SO I I APPRECIATE SOMETHING TO THIS -- I'M IN A VOTE FOR TODAY COMMITTEE BUT I'M IN A RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR WHEN I UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT OF A BETTER. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DOCTOR WELL. AND MAYBE I DIDN'T HEAR CORRECTLY YOU SAID THERE'S NO INTEREST CHARGED ON THESE LOANS. SO CAN YOU TO DIRECTLY AND SORRY. THESE LOANS ARE NOT LO THESE FINANCINGS AS OPPOSED TO DOING PRINTS ONE INTEREST. YOU HAVE A DEAL THE LOOKS MORE LIKE A VENTURE CAPITALIST. FUNDING A START UP YOU SAY. YOU'RE GONNA GO GET AN EDUCATION. AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU COME OUT THE DOOR SIX MONTHS LATER YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME AFFECTS PERCENT OF YOUR INCOME FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME. AND IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PAY ME BACK. THAT'S MY PROBLEM AND IF IT'S MORE I GET MORE UP TO THE CAP. WHICH OF THE CAP THE SYMBOLIC ASIAN STOCKS SO IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING THAT ALONE. RIGHT IT'S DIFFERENT BUT IT'S JUST STILL PROBABLY PAYING MORE THAN YOU GET BUT THAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO INTERESTED IN MY THINKING TO TRANSLATE INTO A CONTINUED OBLIGATION ABSOLUTE OKAY SO SO AND AND THIS IS TO BE FUN BY THE SEE ISSUES IN AT AND NOT. PRIVATE ENTITIES OF SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE IS THAT INITIALLY. THE PILOT IS FUNDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OKAY IF IT IF THE AFTER THE PILOT ENDS WHAT'S THE WHAT IS THE GOAL BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS UP HERE EVERY PILOT BECOMES. A A PROGRAM. FOR LIFE. AND SO. WHAT WE LEARN ANYTHING FROM IT OR NOT? GOES INTO A PERMANENT STATUS SO. I THINK. THERE'S A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. WHEN WE HAVE GONE AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR YOU DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY GET MONEY FROM FIVE OH ONE C.? THREE THEY ARE INTERESTED IN MORE STUDENTS GRADUATING COMPLETING COLLEGE GOING. FOR SO THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT ARE YOU COULD SEE THAT HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. YOU COULD SEE THE STATE GOING FORWARD OFFERING YOU CAN SEE CORPORATION SHOT BECAUSE HE SAW CAN VALLEY SAYING. WE NEED MORE PROGRAM WHICH WILL FUND WE'LL SET OUR COST OF CAPITAL REALLY LOW. TO BE FAIR WITH SILICON VALLEY GETS AS WELL FOR YOU WORKERS OF THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRY THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS OF PLAYING THE SAYS HIS COMPLEXES IS. I GET A COMPLEX TO YOUR POINT. AND SOMETIMES MADE A MISTAKE THIS IS COMPLEX AND TAKE SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR BILL. FOR THAT FAIR I GUESS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- SEE NONE MR VOEPEL IF YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE YOUR CLOTHES YES SIR. ONCE AGAIN ITS PILOT PROGRAM. FUNDED FOR SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IT'S FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD AND THEN WE'LL BE LOOKING AT IT VERY CLOSELY ACTUALLY YOU WILL BE LOOKING AT VERY CLOSELY TO SEE HOW. WELL IT PERFORMED -- ONE OTHER THING ABOUT AND PLOY YEARS IS. I ANTICIPATE CORPORATIONS FUNDING THIS IN THE FUTURE ALSO WHEN THESE KIDS GET A JOB IN SILICON VALLEY OR WHEREVER. THE EMPLOYERS CAN PAY IT OFF. NOT BAD IT CAN BE AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THIS CAN BE GOOD ABOUT -- LAST YEAR THIS PAST ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY IN THE ASSEMBLY THERE WAS ONLY ONE NO VOTE.

[inaudible] FOR SIXTY THREE WELCOME MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ON ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR SIX THREE TODAY. I TODAY PART TIME FACULTY MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTRUCTORS NATIONWIDE SPECIFICALLY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ADJUNCT FACULTY COMPARED. TO NINETEEN THOUSAND FULL TIME INSTRUCTORS COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY RELIANT UPON PART TIME I CHEN FACULTY WHO OFTEN ARE PAID LOW A FEW BENEFITS AND MINIMAL JOB SECURITY. PART TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY ARE THE MOST IMPACTED BY REQUIREMENTS TO HOLD ADVANCED DEGREES AS A RESULT BEAR HEAVY STUDENT LOAN DEBT. MOREOVER MANY ADJUNCT FACULTY MUST WORK THE EQUIVALENT OF FULL TIME HOURS BUT AT MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAS LED TO REGULATORY SILOS THAT HINDER THE ABILITY OF I CHEN FACULTY TO BENEFIT. FROM THE FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM AB FOUR SIX THREE ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THE BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE THAT LIMITS THE OPPORTUNITY A PART TIME ADJUNCT FACULTY FROM APPLYING TO THIS FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE COMMUNITY CALL WITH THREE POINT THREE FIVE HOURS WORKED FOR EACH HOUR OF LECTURE OR CLASSROOM TIME MAKING IT EASIER FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS TO QUALIFY FOR THIS FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. AB FOUR SIX THREE SIX TO ENSURE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF PART TIME FACULTY BY ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM THAT IS BENEFITS. THAT ACTUALLY IS AVAILABLE TO FULL TIME FACULTY. PASSING A BEFORE IT SIX THREE IS IMPERATIVE TO HELP BEING ARE PART TIME FACULTY I BELIEVE IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ASSIST EDUCATORS WHO DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO THEIR STUDENTS EACH AND EVERY DAY WE'RE GIVING THEM A FIGHTING CHANCE TO SIMPLY APPLY TO THIS FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS VALERIE NESBITT A PART TIME FACULTY -- INSTRUCTOR AT SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND PALOMAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS WELL AS ANDREAS LATER A PART TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTOR AT LANEY COLLEGE AND BERKELEY CITY COLLEGE HI -- A GOOD AFTERNOON WHICH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS VALERIE NESBITT AND I'M A PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER TEACHING AT TWO DIFFERENT COLLEGE DISTRICTS. SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND PALOMAR DISTRICT -- I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AB -- FOR SIXTY THREE LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELF HOME. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW I GOT THESE LOANS -- WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN I LEFT MY HOUSE? DUE TO ABUSE -- I WAS REALLY GIVEN THE CHOICE OF STREETS OR SCHOOL HOME AND SCHOOL WITH MY SAFE ZONE SO THAT'S WHERE I WENT AND I STAYED -- I LOVE SCHOOL AND BUT MY PARENTS MADE TOO MUCH MONEY. THEY WEREN'T PAYING FOR MY SCHOOL OBVIOUSLY BUT THEY WERE TARA THAT BUT THEY MADE TOO MUCH MONEY SO I DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR ANY -- STUDENT LOAN -- ANY SORT OF GRANTS OR ANY OF THAT. SO MY ONLY OPTION REALLY TO GET THROUGH SCHOOL WAS STUDENT LOANS -- CURRENTLY AT THIS POINT I HAVE A TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF STUDENT LOANS. AND IT THIS BALANCE HAVE GOTTEN BIGGER OVER TIME -- BECAUSE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO PAY IT. AND SO I HAD FORBEARANCE WHICH ADDS UP THE LOAN PAYMENTS -- AT THIS POINT MY STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS -- EXCEED. SLIGHTLY EXCEED MY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AND WHEN I SAY MY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ACTUALLY MY WIFE'S MORTGAGE PAYMENTS -- I WAS NOT ABLE TO BE PUT ON THE LOAN BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD ART BECAUSE OF MY CREDIT BECAUSE OF THE HUGE STUDENT LOAN DEBT -- AT THIS POINT THERE'S I I AM FIFTY FOUR YEARS OLD AND THERE'S JUST NOT A CHANCE I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO PAY THIS OFF. ABSENT HELP -- I HAVE LOST A LOT OF SLEEP OVER THIS ISSUE AND THEY'RE JUST THERE IT'S IT'S IT'S OVERWHELMING. I I DRIVE AN EIGHT YEAR OLD CAR. I WORKTWO JOBS IN ORDER TO JUST A PORT BY STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS -- I DID APPROACH THE SCENE LONG COMPANIES -- AND WAS TOLD I DID NOT QUALIFY BECAUSE OF I WAS PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER. RIGHT NOW I I AM TEACHING AND ANOTHER -- SO THIS PASSAGE OF THIS BILL IS CRITICAL TO MY PERSONAL -- LIFE -- HOME MY PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL FUTURE ON IT IS IT IS BECOME OF AN IMPERATIVE -- SO I WHILE I AM TEACHING. OVER THE LAST HAVE -- AND THEN ANOTHER CLASS AT ANOTHER -- ONE BUT IN -- ICE I AM PAID JUST FOR THE HOURS THAT I SIT IN THAT CLASSROOM TEACHING HOME I AM NOT PAID. FOR I I AM PAID -- SOME OFFICE HOURS NOT AT THE STANDARD RATE BUT IT WILL YOU KNOW THAT -- AND I DO NOT GET PAID FOR GRADING I DO NOT GET PAID FOR PREP TIME FOR FOR TEXTBOOKS ANY OF THAT -- SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT IS DONE BECAUSE I LOVE IT -- AT LOVE THIS JOB IT'S THE BUT I COULD USE SOME HELP IN PAYING FOR MY STUDENT LOAN SO -- PASSING THIS WOULD REALLY HELP THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANDREA SLATER AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND MY THANKS -- ON BEHALF OF THE PART TIME FACULTY THROUGH THE STATE FOR YOUR TIME. AND ASKING TO SUPPORT THE PASSAGE OF AB. FOR SIXTY THREE I'M IN MY SECOND YEAR TEACHING AND THE PROUD TO COMMUNICATE WHAT SYSTEM AND MY VALLEY I LOVE MY JOB -- IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I BECAME THE PRIMARY EARNER FOR MY HOUSEHOLD AFTER MY PARTNER FACE DISABILITY DUE TO A CHRONIC ILLNESS. AND RIGHT NOW I HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOANS AN INTEREST LARGELY DUE TO MY DEMANDING GRADUATE SCHOOL PROGRAM. THAT ALLOWS ME TO TEACH. THAT MADE IT BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO EVEN WORK PART TIME DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR. I TEACH THE MAXIMUM LOAD OF THREE CLASSES AND BRING HOME LESS THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS. WHEN I HAD HEALTH INSURANCE LAST SEMESTER THROUGH THE DISTRICT MY TAKE HOME PAY WAS REDUCED TO LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH? I WORK HARD FOR MY STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF THE TEN HOURS THAT I AM PAID FOR I SPENT APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER THIRTY HOURS EACH WEEK WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS GRADING PAPERS AND UPDATING THE CLASS LECTURE INFORMATION TO KEEP THE MATERIAL RELEVANT AND ENGAGING FOR MY STUDENTS. THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR MANY OF US WHO DESPITE OUR TITLES ARE REGULARLY DEVOTING MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK TO OUR FACULTY POSITIONS IN ORDER TO PRIORITIZE TEACHING. OTHER FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT AND THE NONPROFIT ARENA THAT WILL PROVIDE A PATHWAY FOR LOAN FORGIVENESS IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. HEY MY STUDENT LOANS HAS BECOME A BALANCING ACT AS MY OUTSIDE CONSULTING WORK IS OFTEN REQUIRED TO COVER BASIC LIVING EXPENSES AND DEVOURED BY MONTHLY STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS. INCREASING LEVELS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY YOUR SUPPORT OF AB FOR SIXTY THREE WILL GIVE US AS PART TIME FACULTY SOME RELIEF AS STUDENT LOANS ARE INCREASINGLY NOT ONLY HAMPERING OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC. SECURITY BUT ALSO PREVENT MANY FROM ACHIEVING LIFE AFFIRMING BENCHMARK SUCH AS STARTING A FAMILY BUYING A HOME OR EVEN PURCHASING A CAR DO THE HIGH DEBT TO INCOME RATIO. THAT THE BURDEN OF STUDENT LOANS CRATES FRANCE WILL WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY ACTIVE IN OUR POSITIONS. AND I VOTE ON AB FOR SIXTY THREE TELLS US PART TIME FACULTY THAT WE ARE VALUED FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THIS TIME. AND I VOTE ON AB FOR SIXTY THREE WILL HELP GIVE US PART TIME FACULTY A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR ECONOMIC SURVIVAL. FOR ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL YOUR AYE VOTE WILL HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE STRESS I FACE TRYING TO REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE CLASSROOM WHILE MEETING MY FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THAT COME TO THE MICROPHONE AND GIVE THEIR NAME IN THE GROUP THAT THEY REPRESENT. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RON ROUTE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE PROUD SPONSOR OF AB FOUR SIX THREE THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS BRIAN HOW ON BEHALF OF LOS RIOS CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WHO ARE STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. JENNIFER SHOPKEEPERS ANOTHER PROP THE FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY TWEENER. SEE NINE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER TWEENER. STEPHANIE GOLDMAN AT THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES OUR BOARD IS NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL STANCE ON THIS YET BUT WE AT IS GENERALLY SUPPORT THE SPIRIT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. YES PLEASE MR BETTER THANK YOU I A FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT HERE. ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS IF THE APPLICATION IS IN SOME WAY -- BUT NOT REFLECTIVE OF ACTUAL HOURS WORKED. COULD THIS COME BACK. TO BITE THE APPLICANTS. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW. IS THERE A FORMULA HERE THAT SAYS. YOU WORK SO MANY HOURS OR IS THIS A REFLECTION OF A TIME CARD OR SOME KIND OF DEMONSTRATION. THAT THE WORK WAS ACTUALLY PERFORMED. OR IS IT AN ASSUMPTION THAT THE WORK IS BEING PERFORMED YEAH. MISTER CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS GIVE PART TIME FACULTY. A SHOT AT QUALIFYING FOR THE FEDERAL. PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM WHAT WE DID IS WE DEVELOPED A MULTIPLIER OF THREE POINT THREE FIVE WHICH WOULD BE APPLIED TO THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT THEY TEACH -- AS AS VALERIE MENTIONED -- PART TIME FACULTY GENERAL CREDIT FOR PLANNING TIME GRADING TIME OFFICE HOURS LIKE CETERA AND SO WITH THIS MULTIPLIER DOES IS GIVE SOMEONE WHO TEACHES NINE HOURS OR A POTENTIALLY THREE CLASSES -- ANOTHER CREDIT TO GET TO THIRTY HOURS WHICH THE FEDS REQUIRE TO QUALIFY FOR THE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM -- DAY IT STATES ARE. ARE ALLOWED TO DETERMINE HOW THOSE HOURS ARE ARE -- ARE CALCULATED AND SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MODEL IT MIGHT GET ME OUT OF IT DID YOU DON'T. HAVE A CONCERN THAT. SEVERAL YEARS FROM NOW. THE FEDS MAY LOOK AT THIS AND DISQUALIFY. I DON'T AT THIS TIME NOW I DON'T -- WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ON THIS LEGISLATION -- THERE ARE NUMBER OF STATES CONSIDERING SIMILAR LEGISLATION -- I THINK WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT THAT -- THIS BILL WILL HELP -- THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR THIS LOAN FORGIVENESS. I I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS I WILL. I DID NEED TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS I DO HAVE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND A BIT OF A CONCERN. ABOUT FORMULA. AND HOW THAT WOULD BE VIEWED BY THE FEDS. BUT THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING THIS BILL. I'M ASSUMING UNDERSTAND. SOME WHAT THE RISK OF THAT KIND OF FORMULA MAY BE AND ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT -- CONSIGNMENT CAN SEND ABOUT IT BUT I WANNA I WANNA MOVE IT FORWARD -- I HAVE GREAT SYMPATHY FOR THE FOR PART TIMERS AT AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES I I HOPE. THAT MY CONCERN IS NOT WELL FOUNDED. THE ANSWER AND I DO WANT TO ADDRESS THAT AS WELL AND JUST EMPHASIZE SIDE SO -- UNDER FEDERAL REGULATION STATES CAN DEFINE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FULL TIME EMPLOYEE I AND SO THAT'S WHAT AB SIX FOUR SIX THREE DOES TODAY IT DEFINES WHAT THAT MEANS IN ORDER FOR A PART TIME FACULTY. ARE IN ORDER FOR THEM JUST TO SIMPLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM I AND APPLY TO IN JUST GIVE THEM A FIGHTING CHANCE TO GET THROUGH THAT I'M IN ORDER. TO RECEIVE SOME KIND OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT FORGIVENESS SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME -- AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU OPPOSED AS WELL I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY TO SHOW OF PART TIME FACULTY THAT THEY ARE VALUED. THEY MISTER CHOI HAD A QUESTION OR A COMMENT. YES I A WAS SORE SO -- CONCERNED ABOUT THE POINT -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON HAS RAISED THE MY CONSULTANT AND A STAFF BOAT RACE THE SAME. A CONCERN THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THE FACT MEMBERS ARE LATER -- AND THAT THE IT MAY BECOME A THE A BURDEN SO RATHER THAN. TAKING A CHAS. AND THEN ALSO. I'M A BIT CONFUSED ABOUT THE TESTIFIED. NATIONWIDE A QUOTE THAT EACH STATE. HAS THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE SUCH A FORMULA -- SO THAT MEANS -- HOW? SO IF YOU JUST TO SIMPLY SUGGEST THAT ONE NOW WHAT THE COURSE OF THREE POINT THREE FIVE HOURS. OUT WITH THAT EXCEPT WHAT -- THIS BODY. PASSING THIS ROLE WE'RE CERTIFIED. THAT -- PART TIME WORKERS ONE OUR TEACHING IS EQUIVALENT TO THREE POINT THREE FIVE HOURS. AS A FULL MORE -- ADJUNCT FACULTY TIME. FOR ABOUT THE EIGHTEEN YEARS -- SO I SYMPATHIZE. HOW VALUABLE TIME WE PUT IN? AT ALL I DIDN'T TEACH IT TO MAKE MONEY -- BUT THE MANY PEOPLE LIKE WE HEAR. US SOME -- SOME TO RELY UPON -- THE INCOME AND TO GET QUALIFIED TO TEACH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THEY HAVE WAS SUCH A HIGHS CHILDREN THAT. AND JUST OF LIKE FIFTY DOLLARS IS SIX SIXTY DOLLARS AN HOUR IS NOT GONNA. IT'LL RAISE UP A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE KIND OF DEPTH THE SO I THINK THAT THIS IS SO. A MEANS OF ATTRACTING GOOD ADAM FACULTY MEMBERS ARE IF WE HAVE A DISCOUNT PROGRAM I'M SURE MORE QUALIFIED PEOPLE. ARE WILL APPLY IN THE WHOLE. THAT THAT THEY CAN GET THE A WAIVER OF THE STERN LOANS -- SO THAT SOMEONE A RECRUITMENT SIDE THE POSITIVE UP BUT THE CURRENTLY STRUGGLING FACULTY MEMBER SO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS. THE ONLY QUESTION THAT THE ISSUES HAVE STATED THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE IS SO SURE. THAT THE CALIFORNIA SO FORMULA THAT THE WE ARE. CONSIDERING WHICH NOW WOULD BE SEPTEMBER AND THEY LATER WOULD NOT STOP BY. NOT THE FACT MEMBERS MEMBERS BACK. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAD A DRESSED AT THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION PRIOR. TO OKAY I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. YES -- I WANT TO THANK -- MISS CERVANTES FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR IT WOMEN WHO COME THE FACULTY TO TO SHARE YOUR IDEAS I THINK IT IS. IT IS -- THIS HEARTENING TO ME AS A AS A CALIFORNIANS THAT WE HAVE FOLKS WHO GO ON TO OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WHAT MEET IN HAND UP WITH SUCH TREMENDOUS DEBT. OF IN THAT WAS NOT THE VISION FOR CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE TO END UP WITH ENORMOUS DEBT. AND SO -- IN TERMS OF THE CONSTANT INCREASE IN PRICE IN THE COST AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IS REALLY QUITE TRAGIC AND AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THAT IS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE NOT. IN DEBT IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS IF IT'S A DEEP HOLE. OF FOR THOSE WHO ARE POOR AND STRUGGLING AND YET I KNOW HOW VALUABLE YOUR ROLE IS AT THE AT THE UNIVERSITIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I WORK WITH A LOT OF PART TIME FACULTY AT YOUR DEPARTMENT FOR PROBABLY THIRTY OF THE FORTY YEARS I WAS A CYNICAL STATE. AND I KNOW THAT I WORK WITH SOME AMAZING PART TIME FACULTY WHO GAVE LOTS OF TIME. AND AND MUCH NEEDED TIME TO OUR STUDENTS AND GRADING PAPERS AND AND COUNSELING THEM ON THE SIDE AND HELPING THEM STAY IN SCHOOL AND AT THE SAME TIME RUNNING ALL OVER THE CITY TO TEACH CLASSES TO TRY TO MAINTAIN A LIFE THEMSELVES. AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PART TIME FACULTY THAT TIME FACULTY AS THEIR ONLY LIFE OF THE THEIR WEALTH ONLY MONEY THEY WERE MAKING. WHO ACTUALLY PROSPERED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE OTHER THAN IN THE EMOTIONAL SENSE OF BEING ABLE TO GET BACK SOMETHING THAT THEY SO STRONGLY BELIEVE THEM? BUT THEY OFTEN SUFFERED FINANCIALLY THEY SUFFERED IN TERMS OF LOANS THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THEY SUFFERED AND NOT BEING ABLE TO LIVE THE LIFESTYLE THAT THEY WANTED BECAUSE OF THEIR INCOME WAS SO LOW. BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE THAT ENCOMPASSED IN IT AND IT REALLY IS A SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TO AS AS A STATE LOOK AT VERY CAREFULLY. AND MAKE SURE THAT WOULD NOT ONCE A CONTRIBUTING TO THE POVERTY. OF CALIFORNIA AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT WE CLAIM WE FIGHT EVERY DAY AND FOLKS WHO HAVE GONE TO SCHOOL AND THAT MEANS DEGREES AND WORK HARD. AND STILL A STRUGGLING THAT'S NOT THE VISION YOU HAD I'M SURE FOR YOUR LIFE AND FOR YOURSELF -- SO I'M I'M REALLY PLEASED ABOUT THIS COMING FORWARD I I KNOW THERE IS JUSTIFICATION FOR IT BECAUSE NO FACULTY TEACHES MORE THAN -- WHO'S A FULL TIME TENURE TRACK FACULTY MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS A WEEK MOST OF US TEACH NINE I TAUGHT THREE SOMETIMES AND SIX DEPENDING ON THE OTHER THING IS THAT I WAS CONSIDERED FULL TIME. AND ARE AND SOLD MOST OF THE TIME IF WE REALLY. WOULD WE FORMULATED CORRECTLY -- IT IS THREE TO FOUR HOURS OR MORE PER HOUR THAT YOU TEACH IN DEALING WITH MEETING WITH STUDENTS GRADING PAPERS PREPARING FOR CLASSES AND DOING YOUR RESEARCH BECAUSE YOU ARE ALSO REACH EXPECTED INDIVIDUALS. AND SELL PEOPLE SOMETIMES LOOK AT PEOPLE HEY BECAUSE I'M ON A LECTURE I MEAN SOMETHING AND SO IT REALLY IS -- A UNFORTUNATE AND SAD FOR ME TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO INDIVIDUAL SO DEDICATED AND SO COMMITTED AND YOU ONLY REPRESENT A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE HUGE NUMBER OF PART TIME FACULTY. WHO ARE SO DEDICATED TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY AND OFTENTIMES TO OUR OUR OUR C. ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE AS WELL? SO DEDICATED TO OUR STUDENTS GIVING SO MUCH AND RECEIVING SO LITTLE IN RETURN OTHER THAN THE SATISFACTION OF HELPING SOMEBODY ELSE SO I I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS. I STRONG SUPPORT I THINK THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE BEGINNING THE ENDBUT THE BEGINNING OF OUR EFFORTS TO REALLY BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS SYSTEM. TO FACULTY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING PARTICULARLY TO PART TIME FACULTY AND THE COMMUTER COLLEGE FACULTY IN PARTICULAR THAT HAS A NECESSARILY NEGOTIATED THE SAME TIME AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE IT'S AN EAGLE STATE. AT THE C. ISSUE AND THAT WE HAVE AT THE UC CAMPUS -- SO I I REALLY APPLAUD YOU FOR WANTING TO BE THERE FOR STUDENTS I THANK YOU FOR THAT I THANK YOU FOR BEING COMMITTED TO THE PROFESSION. THERE IS PROBABLY NO GREATER PROFESSION IN THE WORLD IN TEACHING THAT'S THE TRUTH AND TOUCHING THE HARD TO AND AND SPIRITS AND THE FUTURE OF YOUNG PEOPLE. BUT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SUFFER IN THE PROCESS AND I THINK THAT IS AND THE UNFAIRNESS THAT WE HAVE THE WHICH ARE YOU YOU'RE HELPING OUR CHILDREN. TO GET EDUCATED AND GROW AND DEVELOP AND YET WE HAVE NOT DONE WHAT IS RIGHT TO BUY YOU. SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT FORWARD AND I HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE OF HIGHER IT THAT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. OF OUR ARE MOVING INTO AN AREA ASSN CREW HOPEFULLY MAKE THEM FEEL NOT ONLY GOOD ABOUT GIVING BUT GOOD ABOUT RECEIVING AS WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THE RIVER COULD HAVE A MOTION. I'M OF THE BILL [inaudible] CHOI. I ALSO WAS A PART TIME FACULTY AND I'VE OFTEN SAID AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD NOT EXIST. WERE IT NOT FOR THE PART TIME FACULTY IN OTHER WORDS THE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES EXIST BECAUSE OF THE PART TIME FACULTY. AND ON THE BACKS OF THE PART TIME FACULTY. SO I'M I'M VERY HAPPY -- ALSO TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND STRONGLY AGREE WITH DOCTOR WEBER THAT HOPEFULLY MAYBE THIS IS A BEGINNING. AND NOT THE END. SO WE HAD A MOTION BY DOCTOR WEBER. SECOND BY DOCTOR CHOI. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE CHOI. CHOI AYE MATTEUCCI WE'RE TEACHING I BLOOM.

TO AT EIGHT FIVE THREE TWO YEAH I THINK THEY HAVE SOME WITNESSES IF THEY WANT TO COME FORWARD ALSO THEY'RE HERE -- I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB FIVE THREE TWO THE C. ISSUE PARKING FAIRNESS ACT. AND I HAVE TO CONFESS I DIDN'T OLD STUDENTS PAID SO MUCH FOR PARKING AND IN COMPARISON TO FACULTY. I FEEL GUILTY NOW AS I REALIZE WHAT WE DIDN'T PAY. OF THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH TRAINING OBTAINING A COLLEGE DEGREE HAS RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. ASIDE FROM TUITION COLLEGE STUDENTS AND KERR COST OF HOUSING FOOD TRANSPORTATION FOOD BOOKS AND PERSONAL EXPENSES. AS RESULT OF COSTLY NOT TUITION EXPENSES HOUSING IN SECURITY. THE HIGH COST OF STUDENT PARKING FURTHER EXACERBATES COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. DATA FROM UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA X. ACROSS THE TWENTY THREE C. ISSUE DID DEMONSTRATE STUDENTS DISPROPORTIONATE PAY EGREGIOUS PRICES TO PARK ON CAMPUS. WITH STUDENTS PAYING UP TO FOUR TO FIVE TIMES MORE THAN FACULTY AND STAFF. CURRENTLY THERE ARE STUDENTS OF THIS ISSUE PAYING THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SEMESTER FOR PARKING. WHICH IS SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS A YEAR JUST TO GET TO CLASS THIS IS CONSIDERABLE AND BURDENSOME COSTS TO STUDENTS. I THINK FACULTY PAYS ABOUT SIXTY STE SOME DOLLARS WITH OF SEMESTER SO. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. AB FIVE THIRTY TWO AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ON THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENTION BY PREVENTING BY PREVENTING STUDENTS FROM BEING UNFAIRLY BURDENED WITH ACOSTA PARKING ON CAMPUS COMP COMPARE FULLY FROM ALL OF THE CAMPUS AFFILIATES WITH THE FACULTY STAFF OR ADMINISTRATORS. THIS BILL WOULD HAVE CAMPUS JUST STUDENT PARKING FEES SO THAT NO LONGER THAT THEY NO LONGER SUBSIDIZE THE PARKING RATES OF C. ISSUE FACULTY STAFF ADMINISTRATORS. THIS BILL SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF AB FIVE THREE TWO IS ATTICUS RADIUS THE STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT AND C. ISSUE CHANNEL ISLANDS. AND HANNAH BLACKED OUT A LEGISLATIVE POLICY ANALYST WITH C. CSA. A GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS HANNAH BACKSIDE AND I'M THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY ANALYST FOR THE COST EIGHT STUDENT ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS THE NEARLY HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. WHERE THEN PULL THANKFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER FOR THE WORK SHE'S DONE ON AB FIVE THREE TWO AND ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL? THE BILL SIMPLY PUT REQUIRES THAT THE CSU CHARGE STUDENTS THE LEAST FOR THEIR PARKING AND GIVES THE INSTITUTION OVER TWO YEARS TO RESET THESE PARKING RATES. THERE'S A GREAT NEED FOR AB FIVE THREE TWO TO ANY CSU STUDENT ASKED THEM ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT THEY ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT ALMOST ANY STUDENT WOULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT THEIR CHALLENGE WITH PARKING COSTS. AS YOU ALREADY KNOW THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES OUR STUDENTS FACE ARE DEEP AND BROAD ALTHOUGH SYSTEM WIDE TUITION AND FEES ARE RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED IT TO SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS. CSU STUDENTS REPORT CHALLENGES AND A FOURTEEN THEIR TOTAL COST OF EDUCATION INCLUDING HIGH RATES OF FOOD AND SECURITY FORTY ONE POINT 6% AND HOMELESSNESS TEN POINT 9%. MANY CSU STUDENTS TO DRIVE TO CAMPUS DO SO BECAUSE THEY MUST THEY EITHER WORK ONE OR MORE JOBS IN ADDITION TO BEING A STUDENT OR CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING CLOSE THE UNIVERSITY. OR ATTEND A CAMPUS NOT WELL SERVED BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PARKING ON CAMPUS IS THEIR ONLY OPTION TO GET TO AND FROM SCHOOL. WHAT WE ARE AWARE THAT THERE IS AN ACTIVE J. LACK AUDIT ON CSU PARKING WE BELIEVE THAT THE AUDIT FINDINGS WILL COMPLEMENT AB? FIVE THREE TWO AND RESEARCHING PARKING COSTS SPECIFICALLY WE AT CSSA DISCOVERED THAT STUDENTS PAY MORE FOR PARKING AND STAFF FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION ON EVERY CAMPUS. THESE PARKING RATES ARE DUE TO TWO MAIN FACTORS THE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT STAFF AND FACULTY SAT WITH THE CSU AND THE SELF SUPPORT REQUIREMENT OF THE PARKING FACILITIES ON CAMPUS WHICH MEANS NO OTHER FUNDS CAN BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR BUDGETS. WE UNDERSTAND HOW CRUCIAL IT IS THAT OUR INSTITUTION HAS THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS FINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FACILITIES HOWEVER BY SETTING AND YOU LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT ON PARKING RATES WE BELIEVE A POSITIVE PRESSURE WILL BE PLACED ON OUR ADMINISTRATION. WHERE THEY CAN NO LONGER AGREE TO SUCH AN UNFAIR AGREEMENT WHERE STUDENTS MUST PAY HIGHER PARKING RATES TO SUBSIDIZE A FUNCTIONAL BENEFIT FOR FACULTY AND STAFF? WELL STUDENTS BELIEVE THAT WELL COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR CAMPUS CULTURE AND SAID A STUDENT SUCCESS THE ISSUE HERE IS FAIRNESS. STUDENTS ARE THE ONLY GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PAID TO BE ON CAMPUS. RATHER THEY PAY TUITION AND FEES TO BE THERE AND ARE THE LEAST ABLE TO SHOULDER THESE UNFAIR PARKING COSTS. IT IS A CHALLENGING POLICY ISSUE TO CONSIDER -- THIS IS NO WHERE SOLVABLE TOWN INSTITUTIONAL LEADERSHIP MAKE DIFFICULT CHOICES AND EXECUTE COMPLICATED AND CHALLENGING THINGS EVERY DAY BUT WE HOPE THAT GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN CHALLENGING AND FAIR. EVERYONE CHOOSES FAIRNESS WE THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HER WORK ON THAT CENTER JR I VOTE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIR MEDINA FELLOW ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S ATTICUS REYES AND THE CIGAR PRESIDENT BECAUSE THE CHANNEL ISLANDS GO DOLPHINS. I'M ALSO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. CALIFORNIA STATES IN ASSOCIATION -- I WANNA THANK PERSONALLY GERMAN DEVELOPMENT COME SPEAK TODAY AS WELL AS DOCTOR WEBER FOR HER AMAZING LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT GETS OVERLOOKED VERY OFTEN AS WE TALK ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION WE TALK A LOT ABOUT TUITION WE TALK ABOUT COST OF BOOKS TO TALK ABOUT COST OF HOUSING COST OF FOOD. SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT HANNAH BROUGHT UP A REALLY STAGGERING ARE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENT POPULATION IN THE CSU SYSTEM WHICH IS A MASSIVE STRUCTURE. 41% OF THE STUDENTS ARE HUNGRY. TEN POINT SO WE TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS IS A REALLY POOR BUT ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES LIKE IT'S WATER THE RUGS PARKING. WE FOUND IS THROUGHOUT CAMPUSES THERE'S A LOT OF DISCREPANCIES. AND STUDENTS DON'T GET PAID TO GO TO SCHOOL. THEY ACTUALLY. PAY TO GO TO SCHOOLS WAS ANOTHER FEE THAT GETS OUT ON TOP OF IT. CHANNEL LINE SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS PAY ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS A SEMESTER. TO ATTEND SCHOOL. THERE FACULTY COUNTERPART PAY. NINETY EIGHT THE STUDENTS ARE PAYING TWICE AS MUCH. AS DOCTOR WEBER BROUGHT UP MY COLLEAGUES AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SAN MARCOS PAY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SEMESTER. FOR THEIR FACULTY PAY SIXTY NINE DOLLARS. SEE THE THESE ARE DISCREPANCIES THAT REALLY AFFECTS STUDENTS ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS ISSUES REALLY PERSONAL TO ME BECAUSE I'M ONE OF THE STUDENTS I COMMUTE FIVE DAYS A WEEK AN HOUR EACH WAY. SANTEE FIVE MILES IN TOTAL. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. AS WE TALKED ABOUT COST OF LIVING AND COST TO ATTEND HIGHER EDUCATION I CHOSE TO STAY HOME. BECAUSE I COULD PAY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION ONLY COST ME SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A SEMESTER. VERSUS LIVING ON CAMPUS THAT WOULD NOW COST ME TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SEMESTER. WE HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS I'M NOT AN OUTLINE. 70% OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION ACOSTA CHALLENGE COMMUTES. VAST MAJORITY THOSE 70% OF THAT ALREADY EXISTING SOBRE SOME PUBLISHED HAS TO BY THE PARKING PERMIT. CHANNEL ISLANDS IS FIFTEEN MINUTES AWAY FROM THE FREEWAY. ITS INFORMANTS BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS BUT IT'S NOT AN URBAN AREA. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS NOT VERY ACCESSIBLE TO THE CAMPUS. AND IF YOU'RE DRIVING ALREADY AN HOUR HOUR AND A HALF. YOU JUST WANT TO GET TO CLASS. AS CALIFORNIA'S STRIVES TO ENSURE AND ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE STATE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO MEMBER THE EFFECTS AND RESULTS OF THESE FEES. CHANNEL ISLANDS AND THE CSU IN GENERAL IS A REALLY TRANSFORM THE STRUCTURE TO TRANSFORM INSTITUTION. CHANNEL ISLANDS SERVES A POPULATION AT 52% HISPANIC. 60% FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE. AND 80% PO GRANT RECIPIENTS. HOWEVER MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AT CHANNEL ISLANDS. WHO ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PAY TUITION? TO PAY FOR BOOKS TO PAY FOR HOUSING TO PAY FOR FOOD. THE STRESS OUT ABOUT THIS ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR FEE. THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT CLASSES CAN THEY TAKE ON WHAT DAYS THAT THEY CAN BY THE DAILY PARKING PERMIT. RIGHT IN THE SEMESTER IF THEY CAN ONLY GO TO SCHOOL TWO DAYS A WEEK. THEY WANTED TO PAY THAT ONE NINETY FIVE THEY COULD JUST PAY THE SIX DOLLARS A DAY. BUT WITH ALREADY LIMITED CLASS AVAILABILITY AND CLASS SCHEDULES. THAT'S PROLONGING PEOPLE'S ACADEMIC CAREER. SO YOU'RE SAYING THIS FEES REALLY SYMPTOMATIC OF A LARGER AFFORDABILITY ISSUE. I'LL JUST FINISH UP. SOON TO REMEMBER THAT THIS FEE THE ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR FEES IN THE PARKING FEES ON OUR CAMPUSES. IT'S NOT COVERED BY FINANCIAL AID IT'S NOT WAIVED. BY THE UNIVERSITY FOR LOWER ECONOMIC STUDENTS A MARGIN AS INDIVIDUALS IT'S EXPECTED TO BE PAID IF YOU WANT TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU'D COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE GIVE YOUR NAME WE REPRESENT. CHARACTER HOME ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF SAN FRANCISCO STATE SUPPORT. NO ALL MORE US STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT AT SACRAMENTO STATE AND SEE US AS A BOARD MEMBER IN SUPPORT. I'M RHONDA MARCELLO'S LOBBY QUIRK MA'AM -- COMMITTEE MEMBER AND I'M IN SUPPORT. FROM AVAIL NOW MARTINEZ FRESNO STATE ISSUED ASSOCIATED SINCE INCORPORATED IN SUPPORT. SHANNON SWANSON RESIDENT ADVISER AND STERN ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT NELSON AT SACRAMENTO STATE SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY TWEETERS. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MR LEVINE. AS A GREAT BILL DR WEBBER THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING IT THANK YOU TO CSSA -- FOR FOR MAKE ME PROUD AS A FORMER CSSA CHAIR FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE HOW DID I MISS THIS. TWENTY SOMETHING YEARS AGO -- MAYBE THEY ARE CONFUSED WEREN'T QUITE AS HIGH IT WOULD HAVE CAR SIX ACTUALLY. I LIKE THAT A LIKE THAT -- BUT YOU LIKE IT IT REALLY. OPENS UP THE FLAWS OF HOW WE WE IS THE LEGISLATURE FORCED THE CSU. TO FINANCE PARKING AND IRA ARTHUR AGE PRE EARTHQUAKE WE HAD A PARKING PROBLEM. AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE WHEN THE GARAGES COLLAPSED YOU KNOW WE HAD A HUGE PARKING PROBLEM AND NOW IS WE'VE. STRUGGLED SO HARD AS HE CLIMBED% OUT OF THE RECESSION TO OPEN UP THE SEATS FOR STUDENTS FOR A QUALIFIED TO GO TO A CSU THERE'S AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM BECAUSE WE GOT MORE STUDENTS ARE GOING THANKFULLY BECAUSE THE BUDGET IS GOOD AND PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE. AND IT EXACERBATES THE PARKING DEMAND THAT WE HAVE AND THEN THE NEED FOR MORE PARKING THAT NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED. AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS THAN ANYONE ELSE AND SO WE FINANCE IT ON THE BACK OF STUDENTS THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT IS REALLY FLAWED AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE FACULTY ON THIS IS HOW THEY BARGAINED FOR A LOWER PRICE AND THEY DO A GOOD JOB. AT BARGAINING FOR A LOWER PRICE BUT AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE. AND SO THERE IS A VALUE FOR A PARKING SPOT THERE IS THE COST OF MAINTAINING A PARKING SPOT AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHEN WE ARE WORKING WITH -- OUR EMPLOYEES ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE PRICE A SPOT FOR AN EMPLOYEE. NOW OF COURSE WE SHOULD ALL BE EXTRAORDINARILY UPSET THAT STUDENTS ARE PAYING MORE THAN ADMINISTRATORS. AND THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE FLOCK -- RIGHT THERE -- SO YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF THIS I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THE BILL -- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BILL FIXES THAT PROBLEM BECAUSE WE HAVE. TO UNDO THE WAY THAT WE BARGAINED FOR SPACES AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FINANCE THE PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE SO BADLY NEED ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT. TO OPEN UP THE CAMPUSES TO EVEN MORE STUDENTS SO -- I APPLAUD YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS FOR EXPOSING THIS ISSUE AND ALSO FOR THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR BLUE -- I GENERALLY AGREE WITH -- MR LEVIN'S REMARKS -- ACT I WANT TO POINT OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE -- IS IMPORTANT BUT I I I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE BALANCED APPROACH AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OUR CLIMATE -- GOALS OF WHEN WE SUBSIDIZE PARKING WE ENCOURAGE DRIVING AND I UNDERSTAND I TAKE YOUR POINT THAT FOR US SOME STUDENTS -- THE COMMUTE -- THE A TRANSIT COMMUTERS IMPOSSIBLE OR BICYCLE COMMUTE IS ISN'T POSSIBLE -- BUT WE NEED TO HAVE FOR A FORGET IF WE'RE GONNA. WE WE REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT NOT RACING TO THE BOTTOM FOR PARKING FEES -- I I THINK THE INEQUITY HERE IS THAT AND I YOU KNOW THE HOPE THE FACULTY DOESN'T COME AFTER ME ON THIS BUT WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF WE'RE WE'RE GIVING A BREAK TO FACULTY WHERE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE GIVING IT SOMEWHERE ELSE WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT. HERE ON PARKING IT'S KIND OF ANTIQUATED THINKING THAT WE SHOULD -- PROVIDE -- A BREAK TO ANY GROUP ON PARKING WORK COSTS. OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THE PARKING SPACE -- OTHER OUR MAINTENANCE COSTS -- BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANT TO TELL ME IS -- THAT WERE ENCOURAGING MORE PEOPLE TO DRIVE WHICH IS COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO HERE IN THE CAPITAL. ON ON CLIMATE -- GOING FORWARD I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THE BILL IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT ALREADY BUT A GOING FORWARD DOCTOR WEBER AS YOU THINK THIS THROUGH AND AND TAKE A MAN'S PERHAPS INCLUDE SOME% REQUIREMENTS WERE -- RIDE SHARE PROGRAMS AND AND PERHAPS YOU SOME OF THE FUNDING FROM PARKING -- TO PROVIDE TRANSIT -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING -- AT LEAST AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL IS PROVIDING FREE OR SUBSIDIZED TRANSIT PASSES -- FOR AS MANY STUDENTS AND AND THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO -- JUST PUTTING SOME IDEAS OUT THERE -- SO THE PERHAPS THE SCOPE OF THE BILL CAN BE EXPANDED AND AND INCLUDE THESE ITEMS. MR GAVE UP. YES HANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE WITNESSES FOR BRINGING THIS FORD I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT MEASURE. I DO WANNA SOCIAIS MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA. AND YOU PERHAPS IT'S MAYBE I'M JUST UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT MISUNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT OF THE REGULATORY REGULATORY ARCHITECTURE HERE RELATIVE. TO TO MISTER LEVINE -- AND I'M LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN ONE PLACE FOR TALKS ABOUT FIND ANOTHER PLACE OR TALK ABOUT FEES. BUT I ALSO WORRY ABOUT INADVERTENT CROSS SUBSIDIZATION THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT WERE ENCOURAGING WILL THIS ULTIMATELY ON SOME CAMPUSES UNDERSTAND IT MAY BE DIFFERENT ON YOUR CAMPUS. ACTUALLY MEAN THAT STUDENTS WHO AREN'T DRIVING ARE SUBSIDIZED STUDENTS WHO ARE CHOOSING TO DRIVE AND THAT WOULD BE A CONCERN OF MINE -- BUT I COULDN'T I COULDN'T TELL FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE WE MAY ACTUALLY BE YOU KNOW THAT THIS MONEY IF WE'RE GOING TO IF IT'S NOT CAN BE PAID BY CERTAIN STUDENTS AMANDA BE BE BE PAYING BY OTHERS. AND OR IS IT GOING TO IS THE BURNING A FALLEN STUDENTS WERE TAKING -- I THINK THAT'S NOT THE CASE I COULDN'T TELL FOR SURE FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BUT I WAS JUST -- WOULD BE INTERESTED THE AUTHORS -- COMMENTS ON THAT. WHAT YOU KNOW THE HOPE IN THIS? THE ISSUE THAT'S COMING FORWARD IS NOT ALWAYS JUST THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER THE COST BUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF IT. AND THE IF THERE IS A COST THAT SHOULD BE BORN IN THE AREA OF TRANCE IN PARKING IT SHOULD BE SHARED GENERALLY ACROSS THE BOARD -- AND NOT NECESSARILY ONE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS IS THAT THE STUDENTS OF SUBSIDIZING THE FACULTY WHICH IS BACKWARDS IN SOME WAY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS HAVE A GROUP THAT FACULTY SHOULD HAVE A GREATER INCOME THAN THE STUDENTS AND THE AND THE WAY IT IS NOW IT'S NOT THAT. I MAY END UP BEING ALL THE SAME COST BUT JUST DISTRIBUTED DIFFERENTLY -- SO BECAUSE THEIR CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS UNFAIR NOT THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THREE PARKING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT WHY SHOULD A FACULTY. A WHY SHOULD I PAY FOURTEEN DOLLARS A WEEK A WHAT MONTH WHATEVER IT IS A SIXTY DOLLARS FOR THE SEMESTER AND EVERYBODY AND THEIR PAIN THREE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING YOU KNOW SO THAT IN ITSELF IS AN INEQUITY AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE AN INEQUITY OF THE SYSTEM THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE PAYING MORE THAN FACULTY NOW HOW THEY CHOOSE TO DIVVY IT UP BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE FACULTY. THEY'RE PAYING FOR BASICALLY THE FACULTY TO PARK YOU KNOW THEY'RE PAYING THE BURDEN OF THE FACULTY WHICH IS NOT WHAT. SHOULD HAPPEN BUT FACULTIES ABLE TO LOBBY AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S THERE BUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THAT IS REALLY A MUCH MUCH MORE ABOUT THAT PASSING IT ON TO THE OTHER STUDENTS WHO DON'T. DRIVE BUT IF IF THE DRIVERS IN THE PARKERS ARE GOING TO PAY. FOR A PARKING IT SHOULD BE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY DISTRIBUTED TO STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE LOBBYISTS TO LOBBY FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THEIR ISSUE AND AND AND AND AND WHETHER NOT -- THE OTHER ISSUE OF OF WHAT IT'S NOT TO BE PASSED ON TO OTHER STUDENTS HOPEFULLY THE CAMPUS WON'T DO THAT -- ADDITIONALLY IN TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENT THERE IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE WAS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. BUT YOU STILL HAVE THE ISSUE OF NOT WANTING TO PAY MORE THAN YOUR FAIR SHARE FOR PARKING IF YOU CHOSE TO DRIVE. BUT MANY CAMPUSES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THAT'S A THAT'S CONSISTENT THAT'S THAT'S THAT CAN GET THEM TO AND FROM CAMPUS AS WELL AS IF THEY HAVE A PART TIME JOB ARE THEY GOING TO GET HOME GET TO THE PART TIME JOB. THE THE REALITY IS OUR PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS NOT NECESSARILY PEOPLE FRIENDLY. AND UNFRIENDLY TOWARD PEOPLE WEB LIVES THAT BASICALLY DEMAND THAT THEY BE PLACES QUICKLY AND SO THAT IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE -- I THINK AS CITIES IN AS WE WE DO A LOT OF THINGS THAT OBVIOUSLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET ON THE FREEWAYS -- AND WE DO A LOT IN TERMS OF OUR OWN PLANNING AND NOT PLANNING APPROPRIATELY -- WE'VE DONE VERY LITTLE IN TERMS OF RAPID TRANSIT IN IN THE STATE IN TERMS OF MAKING IT CONVENIENT WHEN WE DO IT IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY IT DOES ENHANCE I KNOW THAT IT'S ENABLE STATE. OF PARKING WAS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS IN THE WORLD ENTRANCE WITH AND GETTING ON AND OFF THE FREEWAY WAS A NIGHTMARE IT'S AN EAGLE STATE ON THE ON THAT MESA. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY NOW HAVE THE TRANSIT COMING THROUGH THE CAMPUS. AND AND AND AND DROPPING STUDENTS OFF MANY THOSE STUDENTS NOW TAKE THE TRANSPORTATION THEY LIVE IN OKLAHOMA THEY LIVE AT THE BEACH WHERE IT IS. AND THAT THAT -- TRANSIT SYSTEM IS RIGHT THERE ON CAMPUS. AND MANY OF OUR STUDENTS USE IT BUT THAT'S RARE THAT'S NOT ON EVERY CAMPUS. AND SO AS A RESULT YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO HAVE TO DRIVE BECAUSE IF NOT IT TAKES AND BEFORE THE BEFORE THAT WAS ON CAMPUS IT WILL TAKE STUDENTS FOR EVER TO pTHE BUS DIDN'T COME. ALWAYS DIRECTLY THERE TO PUT A WHERE YOU WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO DOWNTOWN COME BACK AND THEN IF YOU HAD TO GO TO A JOB. YOU TO FIGURE THAT OUT IN THE MIDST OF ALL YOUR CLASSES AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO ALL WE HAVE TO HAVE STOP OBVIOUSLY PUBLIC TRANSIT THAT THAT IS THAT SENSIBLE AND WORKS WITH STUDENTS SCHEDULE. BUT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THAT THESE. TWO THE FACT THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE PAYING MORE THAN FACULTY FOR TRANSPORTATION TOOK FOR PARKING REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT WHETHER THEY CHOOSE TO DRIVER NOT DRIVE OR WHATEVER THAT. IT IS IT'S JUST UNFAIR THAT THERE HAS BEEN PUT ON STUDENTS TO REALLY CARRY THE BURDEN OF PUBLIC A PARKING ON CAMPUS IS JUST BASED ON THE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY IN COMPARISON TO FACULTY. MR CHOI. I THANK YOU I HAVE WATER SO COUPLE QUESTIONS -- TO A DOCTOR WEBER -- I THINK THIS IS -- PARKING FAIRNESS ACT IS TO IN PRINCE BORDER BEREA. SUPPORTABLE IN THE TO QUESTION NUMBER ONE IS THAT -- YOUR BILL IS A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY VANESSA. A PARKING FAIRNESS ACT OUT. OF WITH DISH. THE NOMINAL MAY BE NOT JUST THOSE OF CAL STATE THAT BUT THE UC SYSTEMS -- AND THEN ALSO OR LAW -- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WHAT CAN WE MAKE IT OR THE PUBLIC ALWAYS AS HOW DO YOU EITHER ELEPHANT TO DO IT ONE BY. ITSELF. THIS IS THE FIRST BITE OF THE ELEPHANT I'M NOT SURE OF ALL THE ELEPHANTS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM ALTHOUGH THAT'S THE ISSUE THEY DEAL WITH THE C. ISSUE AND THE AND AND AND AND JUSTICE IS THERE. CLEARLY WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT YOU SEE WE KNOW THAT YOU SEE THAT ANYTHING WE DO WITH THAT WAS MERELY A SUGGESTION. SO -- YEAH YOU KNOW -- AND IF SO WHAT UNDER THE INTERNET -- THAN THEY THE COLLEGES ARE HUGE THE SYSTEM ITSELF IS LARGE BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF COMMUNICABLE JUST. AND I'VE BEEN SOME COMMUNICABLE JUST WHAT PARKING WAS FREE. BECAUSE IT WAS SO RULES SO FAR OUT THE ITSELF UP THEIR ISSUE IS THAT THEY REPRESENTING THE CAL STATE SYSTEM SO WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEET AT ANY TIME BUT YOU CAN'T DO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ONE OR THE UC CAN ONE YOU KNOW THAT'S OKAY SO I GET IT NUMBER TWO IS THAT I HEARD THAT THIS IS A PART OF THE UNION SO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE NOT BECOME THE FACTOR FOR UNION -- THE SHE ASIAN SO SO EVERYBODY WOULD PAY THE EQUAL AMOUNT. WELL IT IT OBVIOUSLY WILL BE A FACTOR AND MAYBE THE FACT THAT NOW THE STUDENTS HAVE TO PAY IT MAY BE LESS OF A BARGAINING. FOR THE THE FACULTY THE FACULTY DIDN'T COME OUT AND OPPOSES BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD THE UNFAIRNESS OF IT YOU KNOW COULD HAVE COME IN AND THEY CHOSE NOT TO BECAUSE THEY FELT IT WAS UNFAIR. THAT THAT THAT WHEN THEY LOOK AT IT THE ODD I DON'T THINK IS THEIR INTENT AS THEIR NEGOTIATING THEMSELVES TO BASICALLY DO THIS TO STUDENTS WITH THIS IS JUST. THE THE THE END RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENS SO THEY DID NOT COME OPPOSED TO THIS BECAUSE THEY EMPATHIZE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOMEONE FAIRNESS IN THE SYSTEM SO -- THAT'S WHY THEY DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION FOR TWO YEARS SO THE CAMPUS GETS A CHANCE TO WORK IT OUT AND DO WHATEVER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CONVERSATIONS THEY NEED THAT. AND FIGURE OUT THE FAIRNESS THAT NEEDS TO THE PARKING FEES. A SHARD BE EXCLUDED IN THAT THE NEGOTIATION NOW WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING IT WOULDN'T WITH THE WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THEY CAN TO GO SHOULD THEY CAN'T BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS THEM OF THE PRESIDENT. OF THE CAMPUS OF THOSE ARE DOING AND GO **** SHINS THAT WHATEVER THEY AGREED TO HAS TO BE ALSO SUPPORTED BY TWO IN TERMS OF WHAT THE STUDENTS WOULD BE ASKING FOR WHAT THEY'D ASK THE STUDENTS TO GET. IN -- IF -- AFTER NEGOTIATION -- IN NOT REALLY SAID THAT AND THEN IT THE IN BUT FOR THE FACULTY THAT'S UNIVERSE THIS UP IN OUR SUBSIDIZING. SO IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE OP FARE SO IT'D BE MOST OF FAIR. YOU KNOW THEY MAY GET THE MORE -- A PAY RAISE A TO MAKE A MAKE IT UP UP BUT THAT THE LIST OF POP PARKING IS CONCERNED THE BECAUSE A SELF. PARKING STRUCTURES OUT OR SELF FUNDED. AND THAT THEY'LL BE OBVIOUS ALL OVER TWENTY YEARS OF THE AUDIO SO HOW MUCH IT WOULD BE -- THAT THAT THAT THE WOULD BE. EQUALLY -- DISTRIBUTED THROUGH -- PROJECTED THE PARKING SPACE SPACES SO SO THAT THAT YOU TO BE VERY. CLEAN AND THE FAILURE UP BY NOT ALLOWING OUR **** NO PARKING FEES. FOR THE EMPLOYEES OR FACULTY MEMBERS [inaudible] I GUESS BUT ANYWAY THAT'S COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND AND AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BARGAIN ON VARIOUS OTHER THINGS AND WORKING CONDITIONS AS WELL -- BUT THE THING IS THAT -- IF YOU NOTICE UP AND DOWN THE STATE THE PARKING FEES ARE DIFFERENT AND DEPENDING ON THE CAMPUS BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT CHARGING A IN ONE CAMPUS WILL A HUNDRED NINETY DOUBLES CHARGING THREE HUNDRED TO STUDENTS -- OFTENTIMES BUILT ON WHETHER NOT THAT BUILDING NEW BUILDINGS AND WHETHER THEY WANT STUDENTS TO BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE THE CALTRANS SAID A LOT OF THINGS THAT THAT GO INTO IT. AND WHILE WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT OUR MAIN FOCUS IS. THAT IS THE ISSUE OF FAIRNESS NOW THAT STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE SUBSIDIZING FACULTY AND PARKING THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME FAIRNESS IN TERMS OF OF THE FEES THAT ARE CHARGED UNDERSTAND THINKING QUE THANK YOU -- WE TAKE WE TAKE THAT AS A YEAH YOU MAY TELL IT AS A CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK ME I VOTE THANK YOU. WE I I I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK MISTER LEVINE DID IT OF EXCELLENT JOB OF OUTLINING THE THAT THE COST. TO THE TO THE SYSTEM AND WHEN AND HOW YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE DEFERRED BUT CSU IS NOT HERE TO OPPOSE IT SO I'M VERY MUCH. IN FAVOR AND I AND I WOULD SAY BEFORE WE VOTE IN MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. IT IS ALWAYS THE PARKING SERVICES THAT ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT THAT YOU CAN'T PARK FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES WITHOUT COMING BACK AND HAVE IT IF I NEED A TICKET ON YOUR THERE ABOUT THAT IS. BANK BUT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING ELSE IT'S NOT USUALLY THAT QUICK. WITH THAT EXCEPT THE MOTION. SO THE MOVE BY MR PATTERSON. SECOND BY MISTER REYES WHO CHECKED -- MADAM SECRETARY VIEWED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE CHOI. CHOI I MURATSUCHI MURATSUCHI I BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I DALY [inaudible] KILEY LIVE LOW I PATTERSON PATTERSON I SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO I WEBER [inaudible] I THANK YOU. ZERO THE BILL IS OUT AND THANK YOU TO MISTER RAY IS FROM -- HIGH FOR PRESENTING. I WILL GO THROUGH MISTER PATTERSON. THAT IS A FILE ITEM NUMBER. SEVEN AB [inaudible] FIVE OH FIVE RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU [inaudible] UP. AB. FIVE OH FIVE IT WILL GIVE STUDENTS ANOTHER OPTION TO RECEIVE THEIR COURSE MATERIALS AFFORDABLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER. CURRENT LAW PROVIDES CAL GRANTS AND PELL GRANTS TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IN FEDERAL STUDENT AID COMMISSION HOWEVER. SOME ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. RECEIVE THEIR CAL GRANT OF THEIR PELL GRANTS AFTER THE START OF INSTRUCTION. MANY THEY MAY NOT RECEIVE THEIR ASSISTANCE FOR COSTLY TEXT BOOKS UNTIL WEEKS AFTER THIS SEMESTER BEGINS. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC FOR STUDENTS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR REQUIRED READING AN INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. FOR THEIR AND ROLLED CLASSES AB FIVE OH FIVE SEEKS TO AID THE STUDENTS BY REQUIRING THE UNIVERSITIES TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO THEM. FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING REQUIRED BOOKS AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AT THE CAMPUS BOOKSTORE AT THE START OF THE ACADEMIC SEMESTER. OR TERM AND UNTIL ONE DAY BEFORE THE INSTITUTIONS CENSUS DATE FOR THAT ACADEMIC SEMESTER OR TERM. THE BOOKSTORE WOULD THEN REPORT BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT USED BY THE STUDENTS SO IT CAN BE CREDITED AGAINST. THEIR INCOMING GRANT FUNDS. FOR EXAMPLE IF A STUDENT IT IS SET TO RECEIVE FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ONE SEMESTER. AND THEY USED THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT THE BOOKSTORE WILL SUBSEQUENTLY CVS. THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED A FURTHER MORE THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS ALREADY REQUIRE INSTITUTIONS TO ENSURE THE PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS. HAVE FUNDING RESOURCES ACCESSIBLE TO THEM IN ORDER TO OBTAIN BOOKS AND SUPPLIES WITHIN THE FIRST SEVEN DAYS. OF THE TERM AB FIVE OH FIVE SIMPLY IS MIRRORING THIS FEDERAL REQUIREMENT BY EXPANDING IT. TO ANY STUDENT RECEIVING A CAL GRANT TO ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS GET THEIR SUPPLIES. ON TIME. TODAY I HAVE A WITH MEDIA ERIN BEARD LEAD HE IS -- ACRE THE CURRENT STUDENT AT READ THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND ABOUT A PRESIDENT THEIR ASSOCIATED STUDENTS -- CLUB JEFF WHALEN IS HERE AS WELL WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF COLLEGE BOOKSTORES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS ERIN FEAR SAYING LET. I AM A COMMUNICATIONS MAJOR AT READ THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS FROM ALL SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS. WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS HIGHER EDUCATION. AND SOCIAL MOBILITY CAL GRANTS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE MOST FINANCIAL NEED WITH THE MEANS TO AFFORD TUITION AND TEXTBOOKS. AS A LOW INCOME AND AS A FIRST GENERATION STUDENT HAVING ACCESS TO CAL GRANT IS ESSENTIAL FOR ME. TO ATTEND COLLEGE UNFORTUNATELY MY EXPERIENCE AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT HAS SHOWN ME. THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF NOT RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID ON TIME. IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DELAY OTHER MIDDLE COURSES ON MIKE ON ME COMPLETING MY EDUCATION. I TOOK EIGHTEEN UNITS ONE SEMESTER THE TOTAL COST OF THE BOOKS THAT SEMESTER WAS SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. UP FOR MOST STUDENTS SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IS ONE MONTH'S RENT FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUYING ENOUGH GROCERS. BECAUSE OF MY FIND BECAUSE MY FINANCIAL IT HAD NOT RIGHT ON TIME I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASING THE BOOKS. WITH THE EARNINGS FROM MY PART TIME MINIMUM WAGE JOB. AND EVEN AFTER CONSERVING AS MUCH MONEY -- AS MUCH MONEY FROM MY SAVINGS AS I COULD TOWARDS MY BOOKS I COULD NOT AFFORD. THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR ONLINE ACCESS CODE. FOR MY MATH CLASS THE CODE WAS NECESSARY TO TAKE THE QUIZZES FOR THE CLASS AND BECAUSE I MISSED THE FIRST TWO QUIZZES I WAS DROPPED FROM THE CLASS. AT TWO DAYS AFTER I WAS DROPPED IN THE CLASS -- AND FOURTEEN DAYS AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF INSTRUCTION MY CAL GRANT WAS DISTRIBUTED. ARE THERE PLENTY MORE STORIES LIKE MINE ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND IT'S TIME THAT WE SHIP POLICIES THAT INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS. AND I THINK THAT POLICIES LIKE AB FIVE A FIVE DO JUST THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND AGAIN MY NAME IS JEFF WHELAN HI MANAGE THE PIRATES BOOKSTORE MODESTO JUNIOR COLLEGE AS WELL AS MANAGING THE MANZANITA BOOKSTORE AT COLUMBIA COLLEGE WERE PART OF THE SEMI COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. I AM ALSO ON THE BOARD FOR THE CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE STORES AND WE REPRESENT. INSTITUTIONALLY RUN BOOKSTORES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU SEE CSU SYSTEM UP AND DOWN THE STATE EVEN IN THE ARIZONA NEVADA -- SO WHEN I WOULD I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE THIS IS ACTUALLY QUITE EXCITING TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS OF ACTUALLY SEEING A BILL THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON STUDENTS. AND I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES THAT WE'VE HAD STUDENTS WALKING TO THE BOOKSTORE AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED MY BOOKS. I DON'T HAVE MY FUNDS DISBURSED YET WHAT CAN I DO AND FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN MY STAFF TALKING TO ME. WE JUST KIND OF SHRUG OUR SHOULDERS AND GOLD. I DON'T KNOW. AND IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE VERY HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THE STUDENTS HONORED US. WE HAVE A STUDENT RIGHT HERE THAT JUST TESTIFIED -- ONE THING I DID DO IS I TALKED TO PAY HE FITS C IS OUR DIRECTOR OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AT MODESTO JUNIOR COLLEGE. AND SHE DID SAY YES THERE IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PELL GRANTS RECIPIENTS THAT. DO HAVE ISSUES MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT IS ACTUALLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE. BUT CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS HAVE SEEM TO HAVE THE BIGGER ISSUE AS FAR AS HAVING FUNDS DISPERSED -- AT A REASONABLE TIME SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE COURSE MATERIALS AND EVEN SUPPLIES. I NEEDED. ALL RIGHT AT SHE GAVE ME THE NUMBER OF EIGHTY EIGHT FOR THE LAST SPRING OF CAL GRANT -- RECIPIENTS THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAD DISBURSEMENTS DELAY NOW THAT'S NOT A LARGE NUMBER -- COMPARED TO THE ENROLLMENT OF OUR SCHOOL BUT FOR THOSE EIGHTY EIGHT STUDENTS THAT MEANS A LOT -- SO THE OTHER THING THAT IS -- AS I'VE TALKED -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON'S OFFICE -- THE SOMEBODY FROM SERVICE OFFICE CALLED ME RECENTLY. IS THERE IS A HUGE CONCERN OVER THE COST OF SETTING THIS PROGRAM UP. AND I CAN TALK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT COST WOULD BE. WE HAVE POINTED POINT OF SALE SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW THAT HANDLE BILLING WE BILL WE ALLOW YOUR P. AND S. STUDENTS WE ALLOW VETERANS WE ALLOW CAL GRANT -- CAO WORK STUDENTS TO ALL COME AND PURCHASE BOOKS AND WE CHARGE. THE BOOKS AGAINST AN ACCOUNT FROM A VOUCHER THAT WAS SET UP. AND WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS VERY EASILY THIS IS ALREADY SET UP. SO IF THERE'S ANY CONCERNED OVER THE COST -- OF SETTING UP A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT IS -- THE QUESTION ALSO CAME ABOUT WHERE THERE ARE COMPANIES OUT THERE LIKE FALL LET BARNES AND NOBLE THAT WILL LEASE THE BOOKSTORE. HOW ABOUT THEM I UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THEM BUT I DO HAVE A FRIEND? I SUSAN LUCCI WHO -- WORKS OUT OF THE MOUNT SAN ANTONIO I CALLED HER UP TALK TO HER AND AGAIN SHE ALSO FROM THE BARNES AND NOBLE SIDE. THEIR SYSTEM IS SET UP TO DO BILLING THIS IS JUST ANOTHER. TAKES. YOU KNOW THE COST WOULD BE HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES TO TYPE IN. A NEW DEPARTMENT I MEAN SO. THANK YOU YOU'RE VERY WELCOME OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. STEPHANIE GOLDMAN OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY TWEETERS. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE MISTER PATTERSON IT UP CLOSE VERY QUICKLY -- WITH A LITTLE COMMENT ABOUT THAT. SOME OPPOSITION THE DID COME IN RATHER UP LATE AND I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN. AT FIRST I UNDERSTAND MANY STUDENTS PREFER PURCHASING THE BOOKS AND SUPPLIES ONLINE AB FIVE OH FIVE IN NO WAY. IS AIMING TO TAKE THAT OPTION AWAY FROM STUDENTS AT ALL RATHER AB FIVE OH FIVE IS PROVIDING A BACKUP OPTION. ONLY IF STUDENTS WANT TO CHOOSE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT FOR STUDENTS TO PURCHASE BOOKS WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS. AT HAND -- STUDENTS TO PURCHASE BOOKS -- THROUGH AMAZON OR SOME OTHER SOURCE THAT'S ALWAYS OPEN TO THEM TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO AB FIVE A FIVE IS NOT FORCING STUDENTS. TO PURCHASE BOOKS AT THE BOOKSTORE. AS THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE ENTIRE FOR STUDENTS THE SECOND. OPPOSITION THAT WAS BROUGHT IN LATE -- THE POINT AT THE FEDERAL REGULATION ALREADY REQUIRE INSTITUTIONSTO PROVIDE STUDENTS ACCESS TO THEIR FINANCIAL AID BEGINNING SEMESTER PURCHASE BOOKS AND SUPPLIES.

I VOTED ON FOUR SEPARATE OCCASIONS AFFIRMATIVELY SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE TO SUPPORT THE MODERNIZATION OF FACILITIES AND LEARN IMPROVEMENTS. AT EACH OF OUR NINE COLLEGES AT LA CCD THE LAST BALLOT MEASURE PASSED AT 76%. WE RECENTLY BEGAN THE PROCESS FOR ACTING FOR SIMPLE ROUTINE PROJECTS WERE TIMELINESS. AND PROJECT COMPLETION ARE CRITICAL LA CCD SEES BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT AS ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE CAN USE UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE MOST. OR BEST VALUE FOR THE PRECIOUS DOLLARS THAT OUR PUBLIC A GIVES US FOR OVER TEN YEARS. FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS LA SEE CITY WILL BE CONTRACTING CLOSE TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FROM MUCH THE TO PROJECTS LIKE THE NEW CHAVEZ BUILDING AT LOS ANGELES CITY COLLEGE WHICH HOUSES. STUDENT SERVICES AT EAST LA COLLEGE THE NEW. NURSING ALLIED HEALTH FACILITY AND THAT LOS ANGELES PIERCE COLLEGE THE AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION CENTER. WHICH PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE TRAINING SUPPORT LOS ANGELES COUNTIES ALMOST TWO HUNDRED MILLION AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. BUT BEST PIPER KERMAN ALSO IS CRITICAL FOR OTHER PROJECTS SUCH AS THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES TO OUR AGENT INFRASTRUCTURE AT OUR COLLEGES LOS ANGELES TRADE TECHNICAL COLLEGE FOR EXAMPLE IS. NINETY FOUR YEARS OLD THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL INCLUDE STORM WATER CAPTURE AND RETENTION SYSTEMS ABA UPGRADES AND TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THIS BEST PIPER KERMAN HAS YET BEEN UTILIZED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS THE LA U. S. THE IN A PILOT BASIS WE'RE SEEKING THE SAME PROVISION.

THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. MEDINA HI MEDINA I CHOI. CHOI AYE MATTEUCCI MURATSUCHI I BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I DALY. DALY I KILEY. LEVINE. LEVINE I LOW FLOW I PATTERSON. SANTIAGO HI SANTIAGO AYE WEBER. WEBER HI. TEN ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT WE WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. NOW WILL GO ON TO ITEM ONE A. B.. TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WELCOME TO MISTER MCCARTY. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR A WORKING WITH US OVER LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. I TO MAKE SURE THAT AB NINETEEN WAS IMPLEMENTED WHICH GAVE THE FIRST TIME FULL TIME -- FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THIS YEAR WE COME BACK AND WE WANT TO PUSH FOR A SECOND YEAR HI AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT WE WANTED TO ANY STUDENT WHO GOES FULL TIME. A BUT THERE'S MORE THAT -- THE UNDERLYING THIS ISSUE IS ALSO THE ABILITY TO INCREASE STUDENT SUCCESS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHEN A STUDENT GOES FULL TIME TO SCHOOL. THEIR STUDENT SUCCESS NUMBERS GO UP UP SUBSTANTIALLY WE ESTIMATED WE STARTED A. B. NINETEEN THAT WOULD BE 6270% IN STUDENT SUCCESS. SOME OF THE COURTS LIKE THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT HAS SHOWN US UP 283% SUCCESS RATE AND PERSISTENCE NUMBERS FROM THE FIRST. COHORT OF AB NINETEEN TO THE SECOND YEAR IN EXTREMELY VALUABLE -- STEP BOARD IN MAKING EDUCATION DEBT FREE -- AND HELP IN THE PUSH FOR STUDENT SUCCESS -- WHAT THE SAME TIME USING EXISTING PROGRAMS OFF FOR A TO HELP A STUDENT FINANCIALLY WITH NON ON TUITION COST -- AS YOU KNOW THE BILL HAS SEVERAL PARTS TO IT IT'S FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT'S THE WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES THAT MAKES A STUDENTS SUCCESSFUL. IT IS THE ABILITY IT IS THE ABILITY EACH EACH STUDENT TO SIGN UP FOR THE FAST SUPPORT SO THEY CAN GET THEIR CAL GRANT. AND PELL GRANTS -- AND PARTICIPATION THE GUIDED PATHWAYS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I WOULD HAND IT OF ONE A JOINT AUTHORS MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I MISTER SANTIAGO -- PRETTY MUCH LAID OUT THERE BUT IT'S NOT FULL SUPPORT OF THIS WEEK WE IMPLEMENTED THIS BILL LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET WAS PASSED TWO YEARS AGO AND THIS IS A LOGICAL EXTENSION. HOW YOU LOOK ABOUT THE DEBATE IT AS FAR AS FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE? IT MAY NOT MAKE THE MOST SENSE FOR ALL THREE SEGMENTS WE'D LIKE TO DO IT BUT IT'S PROBABLY AN AVOID UNAFFORDABLE WITH. MULTI BILLIONS -- NEEDED TO TO DO THAT THIS ONE IS VERY AFFORDABLE -- AND YOU CAN YOU CAN GET THE BIGGEST BANG SIDE WITH THE FIRST YEAR IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE YOUNG PEOPLE IN COLLEGE WE KNOW THAT OUR ECONOMY -- DICTATES THE MORE PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED DEGREES CERTIFICATES DEGREES IN GENERAL AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT STUDENTS TO ENROLL. FULL TIME ARE MORE LIKELY. TO TRANSPORT OR COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE CERTIFICATE PROGRAM CAN BE SUCCESSFUL SO WE NEED THESE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT WORKS FOR THEM SO THEY CAN CERTAINLY HELP THE FAMILIES AND GET A GOOD PAYING JOB AT TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND THEN -- LASTLY AS MR SANTIAGO NOTED WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS CONCURRENTLY DEFINE US LIGHT EXTENSION OF WHAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A SECOND TIER FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE GO TO COMMUNICATE ALL BEEN THERE EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN THEY GO WORK FOR A COUPLE YEARS MAYBE JOINED THE SERVICE OR SO FORTH. COME BACK AND THEN WANT TO GO OUT AGAIN SO UNDER THE PROPOSAL -- THEY WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT FOR THE FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT THEIR FIRST TIME AND ROLLING SO AT THIS WOULD SAY THAT ANYBODY. WHO'S GOING FULL TIME WOULD GET -- A FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT IT STILL WOULD HAVE A TWO YEAR CAP SO WE THINK THIS MAKES SENSE THAT ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE LOS ANGELES COMMITTEE BECAUSE ON ONE POINT FIRST I WANT TO THANK. MISTER SANTIAGO AND MISS MCCARTY FORD REDUCING ASSEMBLY BILL TO IT IS MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOR STUDENTS WHO AS YOU KNOW THE MOST THAT AMONGST THE MOST HIDEOUS. AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW THIS PROGRAM HAS INDEED WORK FROM A GROUND LEVEL WE HAVE INDEED SEEN. A 54% INCREASE IN DIRECT FULL TIME ENTRANCE FROM THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS A RESULT OF THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. THAT 80% FALL THE FALL PERSISTENCE RATES WHICH FAR EXCEEDS THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE PROMISE PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM'S REALLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER STUDENTS COMPLETING TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH. AND TRANSFER LEVEL MATH IN THE FIRST ACADEMIC YEAR AND FINALLY THE CURRENT QUARTER STUDENTS OF OVER FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS. IS 87% LATINO AND 80% 81% OF LOW INCOME SO THEY ONLY COLLEGE PROMISE BILLS ON THE LEGACY IN A LANDMARK LEGISLATION. OF ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN HAS ENABLED US TO DISTRIBUTE JUST A RESOURCE TO STUDENTS INCLUDING PAT TEXTBOOK CUT TRANSIT PASSES AND OTHER KINDS OF FOOD ASSISTANCE. AND AS I MENTIONED OF THE EARLY RESULTS ARE ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC AT PORTENDS A VERY SOLID FUTURE TO STUDENTS.

THANK YOU THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] WHICH CUSTOMERS SHOULD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SUPPORTED. TO AB NINETEEN AND TO AND HI SUPPORT -- AND CONCEPT WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING MY ONLY CONCERN IS HOW WE'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT AND I I APPRECIATE. TO OF MISTER MCCARTY BEING HERE AS WE BOTH SIT ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. ARM. MY MY FIRST QUESTION IS -- GAG GIVEN THAT BOTH THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND K. THROUGH TWELVE OR UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT TO HAVE WITH THIS -- AFFECTED PROP NINETY FUNDING FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. WELL THE THE THE TENANTS OF THIS -- PROPOSAL THE EXTENT EXTENSION FOR THE SECOND YEAR IS IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. SO TO DO THE THE OUT ON THAT WE'RE PROPOSING WHICH IS WHICH IS IN THE BILL IN THE AMENDMENTS. WOULD COST ANOTHER TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS SO THERE ARE THERE ARE TWO THINGS ONE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT. OUR AND GET SOME ROBUST -- TAX PAYMENT THE STATE COPPER SPECIALLY PEOPLE FILING LATER THAT WE WILL HAVE A MAY REVISE WITH. ADDITIONAL PROP NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE. COMMITTEE CALLED SPLIT 11% WHAT HAVE YOU. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO FUNDED THROUGH THAT -- ABSENT THAT OR IF WORST CASE SCENARIO. IF THE I LIKE THE ELOISE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE A DAY THAT HAD A DECREASE IN PROP -- NINETY EIGHT APPROPRIATION IN THE MAY REVISED. YOUR NON EVERYTHING'S IN ALL BETS ARE OFF A LOT TO RE EVALUATE -- THE THE THE EXPANSION. IN THIS BILL AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS AS WELL SO OUT YOU KNOW THIS IS ALL CONTINGENT UPON THE FINAL ACTION THE BUDGET AND SOME HI -- **** THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE RATHER THAN THE PHYSICAL COMMITTEE -- BUT YEAH THE MAIN AND STOPPING THIS CHAIRMAN IF IF -- IF I MADELINE HERE BUT WE YOU KNOW.

WHAT YEAH? THE MAN MISTER YES I THINK I WOULD SAY IS IT'S NOT COMING OUT OF THE KEY TO TOLL POT. BECAUSE OF THE WAY BUT IN A HIGH LEVEL POINT NINETY IT'S BROKEN DOWN AS AN 11% OF IT GOES TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO THAT'S THAT MONEY COULD BE USED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS AND THEY MAY BE DISAGREEING POINTS OF VIEW BUT WE'LL GET THERE THE SAME TIME THE SAME WAY THAT WE DID OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- WHEN WE DID AB NINETEEN AT THE END OF THE DAY DECISION HAS TO BE MADE? DO YOU WANT TO USE -- SOME OF THAT MONEY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SAY THAT FOR A SECOND OR DO YOU WANT TO GIVE IT BACK TO STUDENTS TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS. SO THE DOLLARS ARE GONNA BE USED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THE DECISION IS HOW THOSE DOLLARS WOULD BE USED AND WE MAY DIFFER ABOUT THAT AND AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WILL RECONCILE THAT SORT OF THOUGHT. THAT 11% A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DOLLARS IS GETTING USED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IT WILL NOT TOUCH -- THAT PORTION -- BUT 89% TO GO SKATING TWELVE BUT WHEN AFFECT THE 41% ISSUE WELL MADE AA APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S BEEN THE SAID THAT THE HISTORY IN THE CUSTOM BUT I THINK THERE IS NOTHING WRITTEN INTO PROP. NINETY EIGHT CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT -- TO TO TO GUARANTEE -- THAT'S BEEN. THE THE THE PRACTICE BUT NOT THE YEAH I THINK I THINK THIS SPLIT WAS IN PROP NINETY LOCATED OKAY I GOT THAT CORRECTED. 11% IS PLANNING IS TEN POINT SOMETHING ALWAYS THE FUNDING MORE FIRST HAVE THAT DEBATE AND BUT MR SANTIAGO SAID.
