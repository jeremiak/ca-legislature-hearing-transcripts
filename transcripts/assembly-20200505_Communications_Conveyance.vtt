ASKED FOR. AND THEY DON'T HAVE

01:22:02.384 --> 01:22:03.918

PREVIOUSLY HAVE GIVEN THEIR

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:34.349
CONSENT. AND I THINK THE

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:36.017
LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE TO BE TWEAK

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:37.252
A LITTLE BIT MAKE OUT

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.621

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:02.043
MY PRESCRIPTION WAS VERY

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:03.945
