AND SO SPECIFICALLY WE WILL BE LOOKING AT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES INSTANCE INCIDENTS. OF VIOLENCE AS WELL AS GANG VIOLENCE -- WHERE WE WILL LOOK AT THE DATA -- AND ALSO HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION -- WITH OUR PANELISTS -- ON PROGRAM TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS -- THAT WEEK THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING -- SOLUTIONS IN THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE COMMUNITIES -- THAT HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS WE WANT -- TO EXTRACT FROM THOSE SUCCESS AND SO WE INVITE -- THAT THOSE PALACE TO COME UP -- TO THE TABLE IN ADDITION TO THAT ON THE COMMUNITY THOSE WHO ARE PRESENT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO WAY HAND BECAUSE THE PUBLIC IS IMPORTANT INTO PROVIDING SOLUTIONS -- TO THIS ISSUE THAT WE BELIEVE EXISTS IN COMMUNITIES OF CALLERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SO THE COMMUNITY YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE INPUT -- WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE -- I'M SOME PAPER FOR YOU SO THAT YOU CAN WRITE DOWN -- AT YOUR PARTICULAR THOUGHTS SO THAT YOU'LL FORGET THOSE THOUGHTS SO YOU CAN SHARE THOSE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME AT THE INDIA THE AGENDA -- FOR THE THE COMMUNITY INPUT AND SO AGAIN -- YOU WILL PARTICIPATE. IN THIS PROCESS AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU ARE HERE TODAY -- LET ME PAUSE FOR A MOMENT WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS JUST SITS ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE. ON THERE'S A NUMBER OF HEARINGS GOING ON COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND SO PEOPLE WILL BE FLOWING IN AND OUT -- SOMETIME IS JUST BE ME. AND THAT'S OKAY WE WILL CERTAINLY TAKE IN ALL THE INPUT AND ALSO THE INFORMATION WE WILL ALSO HAVE SOMEONE TAKING NOTES SO DO WE WILL HOPE THAT -- YOUR COMMENTS -- GET YOUR COMMENTS OF BACK WILL BE CAPTURED -- BY YOUR TESTIMONY AND ALSO TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS WILL BE CAPTURED AS WELL AGAIN OUR DESIRES TO ONE HAVE -- THIS HEARING HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL AND THEN WILL BE MORE WITH THE NEXT HERE'S A LOS ANGELES AND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. AND OUR DESIRE AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE IT COME OUT A WITH A WHITE PAPER -- THAT -- WOULD BEST PRACTICES WITH SOME SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CLAIMING EXTRACTED OF FROM THESE HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT WE CAN PRESENT THIS TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND HOPES IT WILL BE A ROAD MAP FOR US TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES OF GUN VIOLENCE -- IN COMMUNITIES OF COLORS. WE WILL HAVE A ALSO -- PANEL OF INDIVIDUALS WHO -- WHO SPEAK VERY AUTHORITATIVELY -- IN THEIR PERSPECTIVE AREAS OF EXPERTISE AND WE WELCOME. THEM TO DO SO I'M GOING TO POSSIBLE MOMENT AND IT ALSO WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MY COLLEAGUES -- TO WAY AND TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TALK ABOUT THE DISTRICTS IN THE CITIES IN WHICH THEY REPRESENT AND WHY THIS TOPIC IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND SO WITH THAT I WANT -- TO RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM COOPER FREEZE INTRODUCTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN NOW I THINK THE CHAIRMAN -- FOR THING IS COMMITTEE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOPIC A LOT GOING ON WITH GUN VIOLENCE. IN OUR COMMUNITY SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF COLOR -- PARTY COMING LEGISLATURE SPENT THIRTY YEARS AS A CAPTAIN WITH SECOND -- SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND DOCTOR MOFFETT MEANS THE SECOND APPROVED BY MY WORK WITH THEM SO I KNOW DOCTOR. MOFFETT VERY WELL AND WITH THE GUN VIOLENCE -- OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF DIFFERENT WELL DIFFERENT BALLS IN THE AIR. BUT THE ONE THING THAT HE REALLY KEEP COMING BACK TO IN MY IN MY VIEW IS -- DIVIDE. BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS -- IS A SURE SPOKESMAN FOR FOUR YEARS OUT EVERY MURDER IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. KNOWS DOT FIFTY FOUR HOMICIDES PER YEAR. AND THE QUITE OFTEN INVOLVE -- PEOPLE OF COLOR. THOSE REALLY BIG ISSUE AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WE GOT A BRAND NEW ARENA DOWNTOWN THAT'S VERY NICE HERE AND FROM SACRAMENTO. THAT'S VERY NICE AND REVITALIZING DOWNTOWN BUT OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WOULD BE IT IN SECOND THE GOOD SCHOOLS WITHOUT NEIGHBORHOODS GONNA FOOD THE TABLE AND ALL THESE COMMUNITIES LACK THAT. THIS IS BEEN THAT FOREVER. SO THAT'S PROBABLY MOST FRUSTRATING THING -- I WAS OTHER THIRTY YEARS AGO. THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND THE SAME ISSUES THAT WERE GOING ON THEN AND LONG BEFORE THAT. ARE STILL OCCURRING NOW ALSO HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT HOW DO WE FIX THAT. THEN THE DAY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ONE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT CHOI GOES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. YEAH WE DON'T HOPEFULLY WE DON'T WE WON'T NEED A LOT FOR HIM THERE ARE SOME POINT. TO BE TO DO WITH THOSE ISSUES BUT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE SEPARATE THAT. YOU STILL HAVE A CALLS FOR SERVICE. I'M MORE WORK ALL OF YOU LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW LAWS OF CHANGE. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SAFE AND HAVE A CHANCE TO GROW UP IT WAS INTERESTING -- SO I REPRESENTS ALL SACRAMENTO L. GOLD GOLD LODI. SO I LIVE ABOUT -- TO CROW FLIES PLUG OUT FOR MILES FROM MANY OF YOU. IN NO GROVE YOU FIFTEEN THOUSAND KIDS PLAYING YOU SPORTS. THE LARGEST YOUTH SOCCER REGISTRATION IN THE COUNTRY FOR ONE LEAGUE OF THE BIGGEST CAL RIPKEN BASEBALL LEAGUE WHAT'S THE MISSISSIPPI [inaudible] MEADOW VIEW. THE IMPACT AREA A FREE BREAKFAST FREE LUNCH FOR DINNER. IT'S JUST A LOOK AT THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD OVER THERE AND HAS NEVER CHANGED. AND OUR GIRLS A LOT OF ART ARTISTIC STUFF. TOO WHEN I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE WITH YOU WITH THOSE KIDS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY. THEIR LIVES BE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT BUT THEY ARE GETTING THAT. SO HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE. REQUIRES MONEY. AND I DO BUT I DO BELIEVE IS A PER SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE ISSUE SO WE'VE GOT A LOT FOR THE ADULTS. BUT AS FAR AS THE CHILDREN GO THAT PIPELINE IS STILL WIDE OPEN. KIDS ARE FLOWING IN THE SYSTEM HOW DO YOU STOP THAT. HOW DO YOU STOP THAT IT'S A LOT CHEAPER? TO DEAL WITH OUR KIDS AND EDUCATE THEM AND GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED. THE HEALTH OF THE PRISON SO HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE BECAUSE A LOT OF FOLKS AND THAT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. SELECT A SACRAMENTAL LÃ  FOLKS GIVE A LIP SERVICE. BUT WERETHEY DONE. TO CHANGE ALL NEIGHBORHOODS AND MAKE THOSE KIDS LIVES BETTER. THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT POLITICIANS HAVE DONE THAT NO ONE'S DONE THAT. NO SEVEN CLARK SHOOTING CITY PUT IN WHAT I THINK. TO A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SOMETHING SOME AMOUNT. FOR FOR PROGRAMS WILL THIS PROGRAM SHOULD IN EARLIER. LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. SO HOPEFULLY THROUGH THIS -- COMMITTEE WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS AND AND REALLY CHANGE THE NARRATIVE BECAUSE GUNS ARE GONNA BE AROUND GUNS ARE GOING AWAY LOT OF GUNS OUT THERE. ILLEGAL ILLEGAL GUNS. SO HOW TO STOP PEOPLE FROM SHOOTING EACH OTHER. IN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ALSO THE WAY YOU STOP THAT IS. TO GIVE THOSE KIDS NEIGHBORHOODS A CHANCE. EDUCATE THEM. THERE'S ONLY TOOLS WE CAN DO WE TALK ABOUT NUMBERS FOR NOT READING A THIRD GRADE LEVEL. BUT TIME IN THIRD GRADE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SUCCEED HOW WE CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE. THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO WITH SO MANY BALLS IN THE AIR SO I I'M EXCITED. THEY'RE GOING TO GET UP TO LEAVE OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE TO GO TO BUT LOVE TO HEAR FROM SOME OF YOU FOLKS IN YOUR IDEAS AND THOUGHTS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW AT ALL. EVERYONE EXPERIENCE THE TABLE BUT I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING AND NOW I'M GOING THE LISTEN AND SO WE CAN CHANGE THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SUMMER COOPER AND FOR ME VERY BRIEFLY -- ONE GROWING UP IN THE WHAT'S IN LOS ANGELES I'M CERTAINLY GONE BY THIS IS VERY PREVALENT -- WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I GOT INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT AYE SIR -- AS A POLICE OFFICER AND RAY WOULD PLEASE DEPARTMENT AND ALSO -- I PROBABLY WOULD SAY THAT -- I'M THE ONLY ONE OF WHOSE PARTNER WAS ACTUALLY SHOT AND KILLED AND SO I SPEAK FROM -- TO DIFFERENT LANDS IN TWO DIFFERENT SPACES -- AND JUST REPRESENTING WATTS WILLOWBROOK ROB WAS BORN AND RAISED REPRESENTING -- COMPTON -- WHICH JUST LAST FRIDAY A RAPPER -- SOMETHING -- FOUR HUNDRED WAS SHOT EIGHT TIMES -- IN COMPTON -- THE CITY WHICH I REPRESENTS AND IS VERY REAL I'M IN TERMS OF THE GUN BODIES TAKES PLACE THERE ARE REPRESENT CARSON WILMINGTON NORTH LONG BEACH -- SOME OF LIN WOOD GARDENA AND ALSO TORRANCE AND SO THIS ISSUE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME -- IS IMPORTANT TO ME -- NOT ONLY FROM THAT LANDS BUT ALSO ONE WHO -- WHEN I WAS A POLICE OFFICER A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS SITTING IN HIS CAR WAS GIRLFRIEND IN A SOMBER -- JUNE IT WAS IN JULY AND A SUMMER LISTEN TO A RADIO -- ISSUE HE WAS SITTING IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. SINCE GIVING HIS GIRL FOR SAID IN A DRIVERS THAT HE WAS HIS MOTHER'S CAR AND HE WAS IN A PASS OR SEEN SOMEONE CAME UP TO THE WINDOW. AND SHOPPING HERE AND ICE. ROAD UP RESPONDED AND PULLED HIM OUT IN HERE HEARD -- HIM GARGLING IN HIS OWN BLOOD AND I STAYED THERE WITH HIM ALL THE WAY INTO THE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TO THE PARENTS HAD TO BE NOTIFIED -- THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE DONE THE WAS LIVING ON A RESPIRATOR HEADED -- TO DISCONNECTED YEAH AND HE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD BUT THESE THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPENS TOO OFTEN AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND I WANNA GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT WE WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO SOLUTIONS -- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE -- THAT WE AGAIN HEAR YOUR VOICE IS NOW YOUR VOICES BUT ALSO OTHER PEOPLE'S VOICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT BEING SAID. I WANT TO BEGIN THE FIRST PANEL OF GUN BATTLES BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY. WHICH WE WILL START WITH A CASE STUDY OVERVIEW OF BACKGROUND IN DATA THAT WILL -- THAT WE WE HEAR UP AND PERSONAL TESTIMONY CONNECTED -- WITH LOCAL PROGRAMS AWARE OF THE PANEL HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES -- FIFTEEN MINUTES TO TALK AND SHARE WITH US WE WANT TO START THAT OFF BY INTRODUCING DOCTOR STATE MARTINEZ ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO. DR MARTINEZ THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US AND YOU CAN TAKE AWAY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING -- SO I WANT TO START OUT IN JUST A LIKE TO SEND YOU BRING THE MICROPHONE CLOSE TO YOU SO WE CAN CAPTURE YES PEOPLE WATCHING THIS IS. BEING RECORDED LIVE OR SEEN LIVE ALRIGHT SO -- LIKE TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OFFICE FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK HERE TODAY -- AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK -- CORNELIUS BOWSER AND TASHA WILLIAMS IN IN SAN DIEGO FROM COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE. SUPPORT TEAM -- THEY'VE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF ADDRESSING VIOLENCE IN SAN DIEGO AND I'VE BEEN A FEEDER GREATLY FROM MY PARTNERSHIP WORKING WITH THEM AS WELL. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THIS SESSION IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THERE IS VERY LITTLE RESEARCH EVEN AMONG ACADEMICS. ON GUN VIOLENCE THAT'S TROUBLING BUT WHAT'S MORE TROUBLING IS THAT THERE'S LITTLE RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY BLACK AND LATINO SCHOLARS AND RARELY DO WE HEAR THE VOICES FROM PEOPLE OF COLOR -- FROM THE COMMUNITIES WHAT THE GUN VIOLENCE IS CONCENTRATES OF THIS HEARING I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT -- IN BADLY NEEDED. TODAY I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT WERE FOR THIS PORTION OF THE OF THE DISCUSSION I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THREE THINGS TODAY. I'M GONNA START BY DEFINING WHAT IS GUN VIOLENCE IT'S A TERM THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE USE I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOME CLARITY. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE USE THE TERM GUN VIOLENCE -- THEN I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY LOOK AT SOME DATA FROM SAN DIEGO FROM THE CORONER'S OFFICE. IN TRYING TO EXPLORE HOW MUCH OF THE HOMICIDES IN SAN DIEGO ARE TRIBUNE HERBAL TO FIREARMS. AND THEN IN THE THIRD PART OF MY DISCUSSION HERE TODAY I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE LINK. BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND AND AS A PRESSING ISSUE THAT SOME OF YOU MENTION ALREADY I'M GONNA TRY. TO BRING IT TO THE FOREFRONT OF OUR DISCUSSION TODAY. SO LET ME START WITH WHAT IS GUN VIOLENCE. IN THE LITERATURE ON GUN VIOLENCE AND IN SOCIOLOGY THERE'S A TERM. KNOWN AS THE AVAILABILITY HYPOTHESIS IN THIS IS THE IDEA THAT DANGEROUS PEOPLE WILL FIND IT EASIER TO GET A FIREARM. IN GUN RICH ENVIRONMENTS -- AND THERE'S LOTS OF STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THIS -- AND WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THOUGH IS THE CONCLUSION IS NOT THAT MORE GUNS PRODUCES MORE CRIME IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED -- WHAT THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN DEMONSTRATING IS THAT GUN PREVALENCE IS UNRELATED TO RATES OF ASSAULT? AND ROBBERY WHY BECAUSE THAT THOSE ARE FORMS OF VIOLENCE. SO THE STRONG FINDING IS THE GUN USE INTENSIFIES VIOLENCE MAKING IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE VICTIM OF AN ASSAULT OR ROBBERY WILL DIE IN THE MEAT I THINK THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE. THERE ARE SOME -- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PREDISPOSED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEY WILL COMMIT VIOLENCE. BUT YOU PUT A GUN IN THEIR HAND THEN A PERSON IS MORE LIKELY TO DIE AND THAT'S THE SORT OF WAY WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT. GUN VIOLENCE. SO IT FOLLOWS THAT IF WE COULD CURTAIL THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF CRIMINAL VIOLENCE THAN GUNS WOULD DO LESS DAMAGE. FOR EXAMPLE A DROP IN THE OVERALL RATES OF VIOLENCE AS BEEN COUPLED WITH AN EQUALLY SHARP DROP IN GUN VIOLENCE ROBBERIES. RAPES AND ASSAULTS DECLINED 75% BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AT TWENTY NINE POINT ONE PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO SEVEN POINT NINE PER. ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND END GUN VIOLENCE DECLINED LOCK STEP WITH THE OVERALL VIOLENCE PROBLEM. SO LET ME TRY TO GET TO THE POINT HERE WHAT WE MEANBY GUN VIOLENCE. THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST THE AVAILABILITY OF GUNS BUT THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE. IT'S THE COMBINATION OF GUNS AND VIOLENCE THAT PRODUCES HIGHER MURDER RATES AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT GOVERNMENTS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR PEOPLE TO KIND OF YOU WHERE THOSE TWO COMPONENTS -- SO WITHOUT A DOUBT THE ONE STRATEGY FOR REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE IS TO REDUCE CRIMINAL VIOLENCE GENERALLY -- TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE. BETTER TREATMENT FOR MENTAL ILLNESS REDUCE SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES AND DEPLOYED POLICE RESOURCES MORE STRATEGICALLY. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IS ALSO IMPORTANT AND WHAT I'M GOING TO EMPHASIZE TODAY. IS THE IMPORTANCE OF POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS THAT PARTICULAR FACTOR HASN'T BEEN EMPHASIZED ENOUGH IN THE LITERATURE AND I'M GONNA SAY MORE ABOUT THAT IN JUST A BIT. SO IF YOU DIFFERENTLY GUN VIOLENCE IS ABOUT ACCESS THE SUPPLY. AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE MOTIVATIONS. THROW GUN VIOLENCE RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON BOTH. OKAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- SO I'M USING THE THE DATA FROM SAN DIEGO TO TRY TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT A BIGGER PROBLEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE UNITED STATES EVEN THOUGH WE'RE LOOKING AT SAN DIEGO I THINK WHAT WE SEE IN SAN DIEGO WE CAN SORT OF GENERALIZED TO LOTS OF CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO THE COUNTRY. SO THE QUESTION THAT I'M TRYING TO EXPLORE HERE IS HOW MUCH DO GUNS ACCOUNT. FOR THE OVERALL SHARE OF HOMICIDES SO I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE IN HERE WE HAVE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS. THIS IS DATA FROM THE CORONER'S OFFICE AND FROM THE SAN DIEGO A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR -- IN ABOUT ACCIDENTS ACCOUNT FOR THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE BUT 46%. OF NATURAL CAUSES OR NEXT AT 34% SUICIDE. 14% NOW JUST TO BE% CLEAR I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE TODAY. BUT ONE IMPORTANT SEEM RELATED TO GUN VIOLENCE IS SUICIDE AND USUALLY SUICIDE. IS AT LEAST TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN -- HOMICIDES AS A RESULT OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. OKAY SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE PICTURE LOOKS LIKE HOMICIDES ACCOUNT 44%. OF A MOST DEATHS EACH YEAR IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OKAY. SO. LET'S LOOK AT THE HOMICIDE METHODS. JUST TO SORT OF ESTABLISH WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON FIREARMS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOMICIDES IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IN WHAT WE SEE HERE AND THIS IS A CONSISTENT PATTERN THAT OF ALL THE HOMICIDES IN SAN DIEGO WE HAD NINETY THREE CASES WERE MISSING SOME CASES BUT I THINK THIS PATTERN GENERALLY HOLDS TRUE -- OF ALL THE HOMICIDES IN SAN DIEGO. 48% WERE FIREARM RELATED. CUTTING STABBING KNIVES -- CONSTITUTE ABOUT 21% AND BLUNT FORCE ABOUT 16% SO WHAT'S THE TAKE AWAY FROM HERE FIREARM IS THE LEAST FIREARMS ARE LEADING SOURCE OF HOMICIDE JUST WANNA THAT. IN WE SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN JUST SOLD SO WE KNOW THIS ISN'T JUST A TREND IT'S A CONSISTENT PATTERN -- IT THE SAME STORY IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE HAD ROUGHLY THREE THOUSAND DEATHS. 47% OF ARM OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF ACCIDENTS. 33% WERE NATURAL CAUSES SUICIDE 14% AGAIN HOMICIDE -- WAS 4%. AND IT'S THE SAME STORY IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NEARLY HALF THE HOMICIDES PRODUCED WERE PRODUCED BY FIREARMS. CUTTING AGAIN STABBING WAS 22% BLUNT FORCE 19%. IN A SIXTY ASIAN 7% SO WHY WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT. SAN DIEGO IS A WINDOW INTO A CONSISTENT PATTERN WHERE FIREARMS OVERWHELMINGLY ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR HOMICIDES. US IN WE SEE THE SAME PATTERN IN MOST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND WE SEE. A SIMILAR PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SO THIS IS WHEN I SAY STANDING AS A WINDOW INTO THE COUNTRY I THINK THIS IS A IT MAKES ANNUAL RELEVANT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. IT'S NOT JUST A LOCAL ISSUE. ALL RIGHT NOW I WANT TO TURN TO PART THREE OF MY TALK HERE. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY. AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO A PRESSING ISSUE -- REGARDING POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS FROM MY RESEARCH. POLICE USE OF FORCE. IS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE FACING BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE SEE THIS. AND MICHAEL BROWN -- WE SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO ERIC GARDNER. OF FULL LANDAU CASTEEL IN RECENTLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO STEFAN CLARK. THE QUESTION IS HOW IS POLICE USE OF FORCE RELEVANT TO GUN VIOLENCE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET ME TRY. TO INVESTIGATE OR SAY LITTLE SOME PROVIDE LITTLE INSIGHT ON THIS ISSUE FROM A QUOTE. FROM A CRIMINOLOGIST NAME RICHARD ROSENFELD HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE. AND HE WROTE A PAPER RECENTLY TO EXPLAIN THE RECENT SPIKE IN HOMICIDE IN AMERICA. AND HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. HE SAID WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE MUCH LESS CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE THEN TO WHITES. COMPROMISED POLICE LEGITIMACY IS INSTITUTIONALIZE FEATURE. OF DISADVANTAGED BLACK COMMUNITIES. IT HELPS TO EXPLAIN THE PERSISTENCE THE PERSISTENCE OF RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND WHAT I WANT TO SUGGEST HERE HERE'S THE CONNECTION WITH USE OF FORCE AND GUN VIOLENCE. IS THAT AFTER HIGH PROFILE USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS. TRUST OF POLICE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. DECREASES. SOME IN THE MEDIA AND SOME ACADEMICS HAVE REFERRED TO THIS AS THE FERGUSON EFFECT SO THERE IS A TERM FOR THIS -- AND LOW TRUST IN POLICE HAS BEEN A FEATURE HOWEVER IN BLACK COMMUNITIES FOR SOME TIME BUT THE POINT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT THESE USE OF FORCE. INCIDENTS ONLY DEEPEN MISTRUST. AND WHERE THE GUN VIOLENCE FITS INTO THE PICTURE IS IT PEOPLE ARE LESS INCLINED TO COOPERATE WITH THE POLICE WHEN THERE IS A SHOOTING. AND THIS IS WHAT DRIVES UP. GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS IS NOT A TRIVIAL FACTOR -- ROSENFELD WAS DIRECTOR OF AN AYE JAYE SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE TOP THREE REASONS THAT MAY BE DRIVING HOMICIDES IN THE UNITED STATES BUT WE DON'T TALK. ANOTHER ABOUT IT. THE BEATING OF FRANK JUDE'S A TWELVE YEAR OLD BY AN OFF DUTY MILWAUKEE POLICE OFFICER WROTE ROCK THE CITY LEADING TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF FIRINGS AND DEPARTMENT HISTORY. FEDERAL CONVICTION OF SEVEN OFFICERS IN A SERIES OF REFORMS. A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REVEALED ANOTHER ON SCENE BUT FAR REACHING IMPACT RESIDENTS IN PREDOMINATELY BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS IN MILWAUKEE WERE FAR LESS LIKELY TO CALL. NINE ONE ONE CALL SUGGESTS THAT THE INCIDENT ERODED TRUST IN SHARPLY DAMAGE THE RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN THE POLICE AND NEIGHBORHOODS -- AFTER USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS SO THIS IS THE KEY HERE IS USE OF FORCE ISN'T JUST ABOUT -- MISTREATMENT OF PEOPLE BUT IT HAS THE EFFECT OF POTENTIALLY DRIVING UP GUN VIOLENCE -- AS WELL. AND SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN SACRAMENTO WITH TALKED ABOUT OTHER CITIES BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK VERY FAR. TO SAVE MORE ABOUT THIS -- AND SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS BRIEFLY TAKE A LOOK AT SOUTH SACRAMENTO THE MEADOW VIEW AREA. AND I ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE DEL PASO HEIGHTS AREA. WHAT THESE TWO AREAS HAVE IN COMMON LET'S START WITH MEADOW VIEW IS IT THEY HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO SO WHERE THAT CIRCLES DRAWN THERE? THAT'S A ONE MILE RADIUS AROUND WERE STAFF ON CLARK WAS KILLED BY THE POLICE. AND THE AREAS WITH A HIGH YOUR OF RED SHADINGS THE RED AREAS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY. WE ALSO SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR -- WHEN WE LOOK AT DEL PASO HEIGHTS SO THAT CIRCLE AT THE TOP OF THE CITY THERE IS WHERE JOSEPH MAN? WAS KILLED BY POLICE. I BELIEVE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND LIKE. THE SOUTH SACRAMENTO AREA IT ALSO HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY IN THE CITY AS WELL AND THERE'S THERE'S THREE THINGS. THAT THESE TWO PLACES HAVE IN COMMON THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FIRST. THESE ARE PLACES WERE THERE ARE THERE HAS BEEN A HIGH PROFILE USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS MENTIONED JOSEPH MANA MENTIONED STEP ON CLARK -- THESE ARE ALSO AREAS THAT ARE AMONG THE POOREST AND MOST SEGREGATED BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. THEY ALSO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF GUN VIOLENCE. MAC ROAD IN THE SOUTH IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH SACRAMENTO -- IS AN AREA THAT CONSISTENTLY HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST COMBINES IN SACRAMENTO AND ONE IT'S NOT MAC ROAD. IT'S USUALLY THE DAHLE PASO HEIGHTS AREA -- IN THESE TWO AREAS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF GUN VIOLENCE AND THE THIRD THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT THESE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST LEVELS OF PERCEIVED TRUST. TOWARDS THE POLICE. I CAN'T ELABORATE ON THIS FURTHER BUT I RECENTLY COLLECTED LARGE SCALE SURVEY DATA WE GET REGARDING THE PERCEPTIONS OF NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS WHICH I WHICH I PLAN TO RELEASE. AT A LATER DATE BUT LET ME JUST SAY ANECDOTALLY THAT THESE AREAS WE WE'VE I'VE. COLLECTED SOME. GOOD DATA IN THESE AREAS HAVE NOTICEABLY LOWER RATES OF TRUST THAT QUANTITATIVE DATA ON THIS THEN THE REST. OF THE CITY SO THE KEY POINT. IS THAT BOTH GEOGRAPHY AND RACE MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO PERCEIVE TRUST TOWARDS POLICE. AND POOR BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE LOWER RATES OF TRUST TEND TO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS IS I THINK SOMETHING. THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE FURTHER. ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA SAY ONE LAST THING HERE -- I THINK I'M DOING OKAY TIME RIGHT NOW YEAH YOU'RE FINE -- AND THAT IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. COMMUNITY GUN VIOLENCE IS TYPICALLY THE TURN IT'S USED TO EXPLAIN GUN VIOLENCE IN BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES -- WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS POLICING. AND SO -- COMMUNITY VOIGTS ALSO HAS AN EFFECT ON THE POLICE. THE RECENT UNPROVOKED SHOOTING OF NATALIE CORONA AND TORRENT TERRORIST. ARE THE CLEAREST EXAMPLES OF WRIST OFFICERS FACE GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF HAND GUNS IN CIRCULATION. COMMUNITY VIOLENCE AFFECTS POLICE AND THIS MUST BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS WELL. A CENTRAL QUESTION IS HOW MUCH RISK DO POLICE FACE REGARDING GUN VIOLENCE. AND THE ASSUMPTION IS IF THEY'RE EXPOSED TO A LOT OF RISK MAYBE THE USE OF FORCE IS JUSTIFIED. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON BUT IT'S CERTAINLY -- WORTH EXPLORING LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT THAT IT'S NOT JUSTIFIED BUT IT STILL NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED. TO ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO BUILDING TRUST WE MUST ASK WHAT TYPE OF RHYS OFFICERS FACE ON PATROL IN DOES IT JUSTIFY USE OF FORCE. ADDITIONALLY HOW DOES EXPOSURE TO THE POTENTIAL COMBINES A AFFECT THE WAY POLICE PATROL THEIR BEATS AND HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO TRUST TO BUILD TRUST. IN AREAS THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AS WELL. AND I WANT TO SUGGEST IF THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE DISCUSSION. POLICE FATALITIES CAN WIDEN MISTRUST EVEN MORE WITH THE COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES WHO SUFFER FROM GUN VIOLENCE AND POOR RELATIONS. WITH THE POLICE. OKAY LET ME -- TRY TO WRAP THIS UP HERE I HAVE A COUPLE OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS -- THAT MAYBE WE CAN CIRCLE BACK TO YOU -- SO THE MESSAGE HERE TODAY THAT I'VE GIVEN IN THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IS THAT POLICE USE OF FORCE UNDERMINES TRUST. AND RESIDENTS THEREFORE SETTLE CONFLICT OUTSIDE THE LAW OR DON'T CALL THEM AT ALL. IN THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE. TO LIMIT POLICE USE OF FORCE. I KNOW THE BILL PASSED AB THREE NINETY TWO I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT IS TO LOOK AT HOW THIS IS ENFORCED WE SAW THAT SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE PASSED THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE. TRANSPARENCY TO THE POLICE BUT NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET RECORDS TO FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF POLICE MISCONDUCT HAS OCCURRED SO IT'S NOT JUST PASSING THE LAW. BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB THREE NINETY TWO THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. SECOND POLICY RECOMMENDATION IS TO HAVE MORE DEMOCRATICALLY CONTROLLED POLICING. AND POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY VIA ENHANCE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION. AND THEN THE THIRD THING THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS MORE FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAST OF THESE ARE VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS -- TO BUILD TRUST FOR THE TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE. AND THEN THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY TO KIND OF WRAP IT UP. IS WE NEED MORE FUNDING FOR GUN VIOLENCE RESEARCH THE FOCUS IS NOT JUST ON GUN VIOLENCE BUT HOW IT AFFECTS. BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES ARE IS RESEARCH THE PEOPLE -- JUMP ON WHEN THERE'S A MASS SHOOTING. OF VOTE IN THEIRS THE LARGE AMOUNT OF GUN RIGHTS AS IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT LARGELY GOES IGNORED ON A DAILY BASIS AND THAT SHOULD BE A PRIMARY FOCUS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU DOCTOR MARTIN IS A VERY INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION -- QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS FOCUSED ON WAS THERE IS A SECOND WILL MEADOW VIEW AND DAHLE PASO HEIGHTS. SO IF YOU GO BACK. FOR FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS RIGHT THAT IS BEEN THE SAME IN ALL THE AREAS. THEY PLAY PRETTY MUCH BEEN PROVERBS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. SO WE HAVE NUMBERS FROM SAN DIEGO FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE THEM FROM THE CORNERS OFFICE HAVE YOU HAVE YOU GONE BACK THOSE AREAS THAT WERE SEVERELY IMPACTED. TO SEE WITH THOSE NUMBER WORK NUMBERS WERE BACK THEN. THERE'S THERE'S A HISTORY OF LOW TRUST. IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ME I THINK WE'RE JUST SORT OF STARTING TO SEE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. BUT IT'S EXISTED. FOR A LONG TIME AND I THINK NOW WITH SOCIAL MEDIA. IT'S SORT OF SHEDDING LIGHT ON HOW EXTENSIVE THE PROBLEM REALLY IS FAR AS NUMBERS GO SO. DO YOU THINK I I AGREE WITH A LOT OF YOUR POINTS THAT YOU SAID HERE BUT ALSO. WHEN IT COMES DOWN THOSE AREAS ARE SO IMPOVERISHED RIGHT? WHAT THE POLITICIANS DONE TO HELP WITH THAT THAT TO ME THAT PLAYS A PART IN IT TOO NOT INVEST THOSE COMMUNITIES WHEN THE SCHOOLS ARE IN PERFORMING? I HAVE NO SUPERMARKETS NO BANKS NO SPORTS PROGRAMS DOORS PROGRAMS FOR KIDS. THAT THAT PLAYS IN THE FACTOR BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT SECOND THE PICTURE YOU ADD THERE'S OTHER AREAS WE DON'T SEE THAT AT WELL THERE IS A WILL MORE WEALTHIER. SO IT COMES BACK STILL DO. PART IS THAT INCOMING CALL ANYTHING ELSE I MEAN WE'VE DONE A LOT WE PASSED THROUGH. NINETY TWO LIKE I SAID THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IS STILL WIDE OPEN SO NO ONE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE FIVE YEARS AND I'VE BEEN SACRAMENTO NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT REVIVING THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. YES WE WILL BRING YOU READ IT OUT DOWN THERE THROWING A TON OF MONEY DOWNTOWN. I WILL SAY NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE THERE IS ZERO MONEY GOING TOWARDS THEIR AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE AS DEMOCRATS WORKS WE'RE SUPERMAJORITY HERE SIXTY ONE OUT OF EIGHTY ASSEMBLY. NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT THAT PUTTING MONEY THERE THEY WANNA PUT MONEY EVERYWHERE ELSE. EXCEPT RULES NEIGHBORHOODS. SO I MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST ADDRESS THAT PART OF IT YEAH SO I MEAN I ONLY HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES I HAD TO FOCUS ON YOUR SHIRT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WHICH IS THE USE OF FORCE AND ITS ROLE IN POLICING BUT THERE IS. RESEARCH AMONG SOCIOLOGISTS I GIVE EXAMPLE IN PHILADELPHIA FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE HIGH A NUMBERS OF HOMICIDES IN PARTS OF PHILADELPHIA THAT HAD. ABANDONED EMPTY LOTS AND SO WHAT PEOPLE STARTED DOING IS -- THEY STARTED IN EMBARKING ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PUTTING HOUSING PUTTING BUSINESSES IN THOSE WANTS AND LO AND BEHOLD. OF GUN VIOLENCE WENT DOWN SO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THERE IS SOME RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT IT MATTERS IT ABSOLUTELY MATTERS AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED BY A LOT OF GUN VIOLENCE RESEARCHERS AND POLICY MAKERS AS WELL AND IT HAS TO BE. AT THE FOREFRONT AS WELL WE'RE PUTTING SIX OR FIFTY BILLION TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS. BUT WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUE OR THE MIDDLE HEALTH ISSUE THAT'S A BIG ISSUE I CAN SCRATCH MY KNEE. ARGUED A COUGH AND GO TO MED CLINIC AND GET FIXED UP OF SOMEONE'S HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THERE'S REALLY NO PLACE TO GO. AND IT THE STATE. AND LOCALS DON'T REALLY FUND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT OR MENTAL HEALTH WITH THAT. CAN YOU SPEAK ON THAT. SO YES OVER TALKING ABOUT -- GUN VIOLENCE YOU KNOW -- THAT THAT TENDS TO BE KIND OF A SMALLER PERCENT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN GUN VIOLENCE BUT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND SERVICES ARE CRITICAL FOR ANY HEALTHY COMMITTEE THAT'S REALLY. I THINK THE ANECDOTE TO IN ADDITION TO BUILDING TRUST IS BUILDING BUILDING UP HEALTHY COMMUNITIES SO. THAT I THINK ABSOLUTELY -- THERE IS SOME RESEARCH THAT SHOWS A BUILDING COMMUNITIES UP. OF MAKE SOME MORE RESILIENT. TO VIOLENT CRIME AND MAYBE AT ANOTHER TIME I CAN COME AND SPEAK MORE TO THAT ISSUE BUT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND AND THERE IS RESEARCH. TO BACK UP WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING CURRENT THANK YOU I WAS WAS VERY FOR MISTER CHAIR HE'D. HAD SOME -- VERY -- UNIQUE INFORMATION SO THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M BACK SO WHAT APPRECIATE ALSO I WANT -- TO CONSUMER COOPER FORGOT TO MAKE MENTION THAT HE IS HE CHAIRS THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SO IS HIS ROLE BEING ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE WITH ME IS VERY -- IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE BRINGS ALL THAT PERSPECTIVE -- TO THIS COMMITTEE TO HELPING US -- HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION AS WELL AS FINDING OUT REAL SOLUTIONS -- MOVING FORWARD -- DOCTOR MARTINEZ IS ANY FINAL COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH US BEFORE. WE BRING UP OUR NEXT PANEL. BUT I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT THANK YOU THANK YOU CAN USE THE KEY HELP ME GIVE DOCTOR MARTINEZ A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. FOR NEXT -- LIKE -- TO INVITE UP TO THE PADDLE LÃ  WILL BE DEALING WITH A PERSONAL IMPACT AND LOCAL SOLUTIONS -- WILL LIKE TO INVITE A OKAY WHAT OUR MISTER ACCU OF THE SEA [inaudible] ACTUALLY ACCESS. FTS PLEASE THANK YOU OF A VOICE -- OF THE YOUTH AND ALSO JOSH WHO -- JOSHUA ROBBINS PRESIDENT OF THE BLACK STUDENT UNION OF SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE AND ALSO -- DOCTOR SHOW BE. MOFFETT -- DIRECTOR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CANADA IT SCHOLARSHIP -- SCHOLAR PROGRAM WAS A PLEASE -- JOIN ME AT THE TABLE. HEY THERE [inaudible] YES. SO WE HAVE FIFTY MINUTES FOR YOUR PANEL -- IF WE COULD -- PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND INITIAL CELLS FOR THE AUDIENCE. AND JUST PURSUITS REPRESENTATION.

FEDERAL INTEGRATOR JUST CONTINUE ON WE ARE. VERY AXES -- FOUNDER VOICE OF THE YOUTH COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS -- VERY MUCH A PART OF A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- REMEMBERING THE TIME IN -- TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN -- TRAYVON MARTIN WAS KILLED AND THEN WHEN YOU HAD MIKE BROWN KILLED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND SAYING TO OUR FORMER MAYOR. THAT SACRAMENTO IS WINE NATIONAL MOMENT. OF BEING JUST LIKE FERGUSON AND WITH A SMIRK HE SAID NO AND NOW WE HAVE THE STUFF ON CLARK AS MANY AS WELL AS MANY OTHER OBJECTS HEARING SACRAMENTO MY IDEA. OF IDENTIFYING NOT ONLY THE CAUSES OF THE VIOLENCE THAT HAS BEEN INFLICTED ON ON AFRICAN AMERICANS BY POLICE BUT HOLDING A POLICE OFFICER ACCOUNTABLE WHEN LETTING IT KNOWN. THAT GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY -- IS ALSO POLICE VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY. JOSH WILL ROBINSON A COMMUNITY ADVOCATE STUDENT ORGANIZER SECOND MOSTLY BECAUSE BLACKS IN UNION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR MY OFFICE WOULD YOU PLEASE START OUR PRESENTATION SURE. I I HEARD A DOCTOR MARTINEZ TALK LOOK AT ABOUT A SACRAMENTO AND SOMEWHAT THE HISTORY OF GUN VIOLENCE ARE I HAVE A PROGRAM THAT I AM THE A CREATOR AND FOUNDER OF AGAIN AS I SAID IT'S CALLED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN AS SCHOLARS PROGRAM. SO I'M HERE. A DOCTOR MORE ABOUT SOLUTIONS ANOTHER RETIREMENT GUN VIOLENCE BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS I TRIED -- TO CREE SOMETHING BETTER BETTER OPTION FOR A YOUNG WOMEN AND MEN THROUGHOUT THE CITY SECOND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT I DID A HISTORICAL LOOK BACK AGAIN AND THROUGH WRECKED FIFTY PLUS YEARS AGO YOU HAD THE COMMISSION THE ADVISORY COMMISSION ON CIVIL DISORDER. AND ONE OF THINGS THEY TALKED ABOUT FIVE DECADES OR SO AGO WAS THE FACT THAT. AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS. OF WERE IMPOVERISHED AND THEY WERE POVERTY PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM -- PRETTY MUCH IN THE KERNEL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COUPLE RECOMMENDATIONS THEY TALKED ABOUT WE GIVE HEM BETTER EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ONE THINGS I BUY MORE TIME I TALKED ABOUT AS WELL. ALSO TO GET THEM A JOB IS ALL ABOUT ECONOMICS WE LIVE IN A CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY SO THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN NEED EMPLOYMENT AND THEY SAID. IF YOU'RE IN THE PRIMARY. MARKET WE'RE AS FAR AS MAKING WAGES YOU'RE GONNA DO OKAY IF YOU'RE IN THE SECONDARY WAGE LABOR MARKET YOU'RE GONNA NEED ASSISTANCE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND THEN OF COURSE THOSE PERSONS WHO DON'T MAKE AS MUCH AND DON'T DO AS WELL. DON'T HAVE A GOOD EDUCATION THE LIKELIHOOD IS THEY'RE GONNA FIND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OR PRODUCTIVE IS GOING TO FIND THEM. SO ONE OF THINGS THAT I WAS LOOKING. FOR IS THAT WITH THE KERNER REPORT -- THAT THEY WROTE UP BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN SIXTY EIGHT IT TALK ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE NEED TO DO BETTER FOR THESE YOUNG MEN AN WOMEN IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS WE DID HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WITH THE MASTER PLAN WHICH IS WHY COMMUNITY COLLEGES. A WHILE AGO WERE FREE -- THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT AGAIN EMPLOYMENT SOLD RECOMMENDATIONS WERE TO FIND THESE FOLKS ARE JOB PARTICULARLY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GIVE THEM A JOB IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANOTHER PERSON OR PERSONS OF COLOR. BEING INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY IS GONNA LESSEN BECAUSE THE ALL THE ARTICLE OR SOME OF THE REPORT ALSO TALKED ABOUT AN OCCUPATION OF ARM -- OFFICERS PARTICULARLY -- WHITE OFFICERS WERE INVOLVED IN PRIMARILY -- RACING AT THE MINORITY -- NEIGHBORHOODS TO SAY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AGAIN TO DEFUSE THE TENSIONS WE NEED TO CREATE GREATER DIVERSITY WILL ALSO NEED TO CREATE A GREATER PUBLIC IMAGE THOSE OF THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS THEY TALKED ABOUT. BUT MANY OFFICES BACK IN THE PAST TALKED ABOUT IS NOT OUR PROBLEM NOW IS THE MANTRA WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPERTY WHEN A RESPONSE OF RADICALISM. WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE -- FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO. I STARTED LOOKING AT FROM THAT ASPECT OF HOW I WAS GOING TO CREATE THE PROGRAM SO I STARTED TALKING -- TO MANY OF MY STUDENTS -- AND AND I WAS WONDER WHY THEY WERE NOT GETTING JOBS. IN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY WEREN'T GETTING JOBS WAS THAT. THOSE WHO TRIED THEY STILL DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD GRASP OF THE LAW THE LEGAL SYSTEM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT A CARAMEL JUSTICE COMMUNITY. SO LOOK TO THAT SAME WE NEED TO DO A LOT BETTER WE NEED TO NOT JUST HAVE THEM GO THROUGH THE CLASSES THEN TRY TO APPLY TO BECOME AN OFFICER. THEN THERE LACK IN CERTAIN SKILLS ALSO TALKED TO OFFICERS ARE ALSO ON THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY ON THE DEPARTMENT THEY TALKED ABOUT. OF THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOT READY OR PREPARE FOR THE RIGORS OF THE JOB -- THEY MAY PASSED THE CLASSES THEY STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WERE THE IMPORTANT SOCIAL AND CULTURAL THINGS HAPPENING. IN LHASA TALK TO ME IN THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THEY WERE TELLING ME THAT THE OFFICES IT DID PASS AND DO WELL. THEY DO NOT HAVE CULTURAL COMPETENCY ONE OF THINGS I LIKE TO SAY THEY DIDN'T HAVE NOT HAVE THE CULTURE HUMILITY. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL CULTURAL AND EMOTIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR PERSONS PARTICULAR OF COLOR -- TO WORKING THERE SO THAT THAT'S WERE PRETTY MUCH GOT THE IMPETUS TO CREATE THE PROGRAM THAT I HAVE TODAY SO WHAT THE LAW FOR SOME KIND OF SCHOLARS PROGRAM IS. IT IS A A PATHWAY PROGRAM TO CREATE GREATER ACCESS AND AWARENESS. TO THESE YOUNG FOLKS SO CREATED A COMBINATION OF TENT WORKSHOPS FOR THEM DID VERY FROM LEADERSHIP -- TEST PREP. OUR LITTLE WE HAVE A A WOMAN WHO COMES IN VISIT EVERY YEAR SHE'S A RETIRED ENGLISH TEACHER. SHE WILL TEST THEM ON HOW TO PASS THE EXAM WE HAVE LEADERS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES TO COME IN AND TELL THEM ABOUT THE NOBILITY OF POLICING AND WHAT IT'S ABOUT. AND WHAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS MONEY MANY OF THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THAT IDEA WITH PARTICULARLY IN COLLEGE BUT ALSO GO TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS. AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AS WELL. THEY'VE GOTTEN A SOME SOMEWHAT OF THE NOT THE GREAT THE GREATEST NEAR TO THE LAW FOR SIN AS YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HEAR. SO IF YOU ASK MANY PEOPLE AND REYES WHETHER MINORITY COMMUTE PREDOMINATELY OUR OUR RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE DIFFICULT OF THE COPS AND ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO PUBLIC TRUST WE DON'T TRUST THE COPS. SO WHEN TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M IMPACT THEM AS BEST I CAN TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND ALSO ONE OF THEM HAVE ACCESS. TO LONG FOR SAUCES ARE SELF. WHEN I ATTENDED? SOME SCHOOLS IN THE PAST ONE OF THE THINGS I TALKED AS YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ABOUT IN -- IN HIGH SCHOOL I ASK THEM HOW MANY OF YOU WANT TO BE A LAW FOR SAUCE. AND MANY OF THE CLASS WILL BE BUT THEN I ASK THEM HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY A LONG FORCE ALSO TO ADD TO HELP YOU BECOME AN OFFER AND NONE AND RAISE YOUR HANDS AND THAT'S WRESTLE THE DISCONNECT. IS THAT EVERYONE WILL SAY OH YES YES I AM THIS I WANT TO HELP I WANT TO PARTICIPATE BUT THEY DID NOTHING AFTER THAT. AND THIS IS WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES IT CONNECTS. THESE YOUNG FOLKS TO MAKE THEM OF MORE -- PREPARED AND MORE ADVANCE SO THEY CAN BECOME GREAT CADETS AND MOVE INTO -- LAW ENFORCEMENT SO. THE PROGRAM IS ALL ABOUT WHAT I CALL A WEED AND SEED AFFECT. I REALIZE THAT AND WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING NOW. THAT CHANGE AS FAST BUT I'M HOPING THAT THE YOUNG OFFICES THAT I'VE ALREADY PUT THROUGH AND HAD GONE TO THE SECOND PLEASED FORMS ACADEMY AND CAL FOR HER PATROLS ACADEMY. BUT I CAN GET THEM. TO BE BETTER PREPARED MORE CULTURALLY DIVERSE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS ONE OF THINGS WE DO WE WORK ON A LOT IS -- MENTAL HEALTH PREPARATION WE HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE ACADEMY'S WERE THEIR TRAINING AND PREPARING TO DEAL ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE AND TO DEAL PARTICULARLY WITH THOSE IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHERE THERE ARE. DISADVANTAGES WHETHER THEY BE SOCIAL CULTURAL ADVANTAGES THAT'S JUST. PART OF THE PART OF WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES AND IT'S A IT'S A TWO YEAR PROGRAM THAT GETS THEM THROUGH COLLEGE -- THE GRADUATE THE CAT THEIR DEGREE THE GOING TO THE ACADEMY AND OF COURSE WE HAVE THE MORE WELL PREPARED IN THE AND WE KNOW IT'S BEEN A SUCCESS HAS BEEN GONE FOR THREE YEARS. AND WHAT WE'VE HAD SO FAR IS THE FACT IT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS THAT HAVE GRADUATED -- THEY'VE GONE ON BEEN AND DONE VERY WELL THUS FAR IN THE PLEASE PROMISE AND WE'RE OPEN TO THE YEARS TO COME THEY CAN DO MUCH BETTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS ATKINS -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HISTORY WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GET DEEPER INTO THE HISTORY OF POLICING? IN AMERICA FIRST ALL LIKE TO SAY THAT POLICING IN AMERICA. IS A PUBLIC EPIDEMIC OF KILLING. OF GENOCIDE ALL OF ONE WARRANTED ARRESTS -- BIAS. pGUILTY. BOB OFFICERS THAT KILL. BLACK PEOPLE. THIS LABEL TROLL. IF WE LOOK AT OUR HISTORY THE SLAVE PATROL WAS ORGANIZED AN ORGANIZED GROUP OF WHITE MEN WHO MONITORED AND ENFORCED DISCIPLINE UPON BLACK SLAVES. THEIR MAIN FUNCTION WAS POLICE THE SLAVING FOR SLAVE COLDS PREVENT. LARGE GATHERINGS INSTALL FEAR AND CATCH ONE WAYS. SLEEPER TROLLS LED DIRECTLY INTO THE KKK. AND NOW AS WE SEE OR MARTIN DAY. POLICE SYSTEM. SEOUL IF WE'RE GOING TO DIVE INTO THE HISTORY OF POLICING LET'S NOT FORGET THE ORIGIN OF POLICING AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE KIND TO DEFER. IN A SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING THAT. TRAINING. OVER AND OVER AND HAVING A DIVERSE POLICE FORCE WOULD ALL OF A SUDDEN CREATE THIS CHANGE WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT. WE'VE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN MATTER OF FACT A LOT OF OUR FUNDING GOALS INTO EXTRA POLICE TRAINING. AND TO NO AVAIL. AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE BLACK BODIES LAY DOWN DEAD IN THE STREET. SO I ASKED THIS QUESTION WHAT IS REALLY TRAINING. AND WHO WAS DOING THE TRAINING. AND WHY DO WE CONSIDER TO THINK THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF BLACK OFFICERS THINGS WILL CHANGE. I POINT THIS DIRECTION BECAUSE EVERY TIME. FIVE I'VE WOKEN UP. IN THE LAST WEEK. I'VE HEARD THIS THING. AND IT CONFUSES ME. IT SAYS A BLUE LIVES MATTER. SO THAT RIGHT THERE PARTICULARLY TELLS ME THAT ANY OFFICER BLACK WHITE OR IN DIFFERENT WHO PUTS ON A UNIFORM. IS NOW CONSIDERED A BLUE LIFE IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED A BLACK MAN OR BLACK WOMEN OR LATINO MAN A LATINO WOMAN THEY'RE CONSIDERED BLUE. AND THIS SAME NOTION OF BLUE LIVES MATTER CAME IN A DIRECT CORRELATION OF ATTACKING THE MOVEMENT A CAMPAIGN THAT SAID BLACK LIVES MATTER BECAUSE BLACK LIVES MATTER BUT IT WAS NOT BEING SHOWN ACROSS AMERICA WHEN. NUMEROUS KILLINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT'S HAPPENING. FROM THE TIME OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO CURRENTLY IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO WHEN WE DECIDE TO HAVE THE REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT POLICING IN AMERICA LET'S GO BACK TO OUR HISTORY. POLICE WERE CONSIDERED SLAVE PATROL ACHEI A SLAVE CATCHERS. THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED AS BLACK PEOPLE. BY THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN TO BE TARGETS. NO KIND OF TRAINING. CAN DEVELOP THE CHANGEABLE CULTURE. FILLED WITH BIAS. PREJUDICE AND LED BY CERTAIN STEREO TYPES SO YOU CAN BE A BLACK MAN TRAINING. YOU COULD BE A BLACK POLICE OFFICER BUT AS SOON AS YOU PUT THAT BACK I JOIN YOU CONSIDER TO BE BLUE. AS A BLUE LIFE WHO LOSES THEIR LIFE IN THE CALL OF THEIR DUTY. IS CONSIDERED A HERO. NOT MATTER IN IF THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE FIELD FOR TWO WEEKS OR BEEN A A A A PRODUCTIVE OFFICER FOR TWENTY YEARS. THEY'RE CONSIDERED A HERO. BUT WHEN A BLACK LIFE IS TOOK IT AWAY BY A POLICE OFFICER FOR KNOLL REASON WHATSOEVER BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. AUTOMATICALLY IN MEDIA. BECAUSE OF WHAT THE POLICE HAVE NOW REPORTED TO MEDIA OR WHATEVER THE MEDIA DECIDES TO PUT OUT THEY ARE CALLED. CRIMINALS. AND THEIR SUSPECTS. WHAT IN ONE REGARD ON OFFER SERVERS ALWAYS CALL THE HERO? AND EVEN OFFER SO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY REALLY WERE HERE -- IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO WHEN WE LOOK. AND WE WE CHALLENGED THESE IDEAS THESE CONTENT IDEAS OF TRAINING MORE TRAINING DIVERSE CITY DIVERSE CITY WE HAVE PLENTY. BLACK POLICE CHIEFS. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE BLACK MARKS. AND IF WE LOOK AND SAY WELL. MAYBE IN BALTIMORE. THAT HAS A BLACK POLICE CHIEF THERE WEREN'T THAT MANY MURDERS OF BLACK PEOPLE I CHALLENGE THE FACT THAT. ANY MURDER OF A BLACK PERSON ON ARM IS MORE THAN WE NEED THERE SHOULD NOT BE ONE MURDER. SO THE FACT THAT WE ARE CHALLENGING OURSELVES A FIGURE THAT WE'VE HAD LESS. MURDERS IN CERTAIN CITIES AND APPLAUDING OURSELVES IS RIDICULOUS. IT'S FRUSTRATING AND IT ANGERS ME THAT WE HAVE JUST CONTINUOUSLY HAD THESE COMMITTEES THESE CONVERSATIONS AND ONE THING HASN'T BEEN DONE. WHEN POLICE VIOLATE THE COLDER PROTECTING AND SERVING WHEN THE POLICE? USED EXCESSIVE FORCE WHEN POLICE DO NOT HAVE THEIR BODY CAMERAS INDIVIDUALS THIRTY SOME ODD TIMES AND DON'T HAVE A REAL REASON OF WHY THEY SHOT AN UNARMED BLACK PERSON THIRTY ALL TIMES. WE HAVE THAT POLICE OFFICER CONTINUING TO WALK OUR STREETS. WE HAVE NO GUILTY VERDICTS. WE HAVE NO TRANSPARENCY. AND POLICE RARELY SEE A NIGHT IN JAIL. THE FUNNY THING IS POLICE ACTUALLY GET CELEBRATED WHEN THEY'RE KILLED ON ON OFFICER THEY GET GOAL FUNDING THESE. DAVE BASICALLY HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY ARE HEROES AND THEY DID THE RIGHT THING THEY PUT SERVE THEM BE PROTECTED THE COMMUNITY. THE SAME COMMUNITY THAT THESE POLICE OFFICERS CONTINUE CONTINUE TO TERRORIZE. UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IS POLICE TERROR IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS I'VE WORKED WITH. MANY FAMILY MEMBERS. AND ASKING ME WHY MY SON. AND I THINK BACK OF DARYL RICHARDS. WHO I SPOKE TO THE MOTHER JUST THE OTHER DAY? WELL SHE HAD A SURE ON IN CONTINUES ASK ME WHY. SHE HAS NO IDEA. AND FOR HER TO WATCH THE CELEBRATING [inaudible] THIS OFFICER. WHO WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY? ED FOR HER SON. SHE NOT. GOT A SORRY [inaudible] AN APOLOGY. SHE GOT TOLD OR SOME WITH THE SUSPECT. AND OUR SON CAN NEVER COME BACK. I THINK ABOUT A MARSHALL MILES. WHOSE MOTHER PLAYED. AND ASKED THE SHERIFF TO PLEASE BRING HIM INTO A FACILITY. TO GET TO MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. TO NO AVAIL THEY SENT HIM TO THE COUNTY JAIL. AND LATER ON HE WAS HOG TIED. BROUGH REALIZE IN HIS CELL IS THIS WHAT WE CALL GOOD TRAINING. THIRTY SECONDS I THINK ABOUT STEFAN CLARK. GOING BACK HOME TO HIS GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE. BEING CALLED A SUSPECT IN BEING TOLD. TO THE MEDIA SAYING THAT. HE WAS A PERSON THAT BROKE WINDOWS. AND I ASKED DOES MURDER CONSTITUE BREAKING WINDOWS. HIS GRANDMOTHER. HIS MOTHER [inaudible] HIS BROTHER. MOVES WITH THE DEATH OF STEP ON CLARK AS THE CITY MOVES WITH THE DEFICIT UP ON CLARK I THINK ABOUT BRANDON SMITH. WHO WAS ALSO? KILLED BY POLICE OFFICERS. BECAUSE OF HIS INCIDENT. I ASKED WASTHIS AGAIN CONSIDER GOOD TRAINING. SO MIGHT AS I IN THIS. I SAY THAT IF WE DON'T IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE NO LONGER WAITING. FOR WHAT. MY GOOD PUBLIC PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO CHANGE WE ARE DEMANDING THAT YOU START FIRING. POLICE OFFICERS GETTING MANDATORY DRUG TESTING TWO POLICE OFFICERS WHO USE THEIR FIREARMS AND NOT WAIT IT CONTINUE TO ALLOW COMMUNITIES TO COME BACK. TO THESE ASSEMBLY MEETINGS COR CREATE MARCHES AND TO TALKING TO PETITION ABOUT WHY OUR LIVES MATTER DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THAT'S HOW YOU STOP. POLICE. KILLINGS OF BLACK PEOPLE AND OTHER MINORITIES THANK YOU AS WE CONTINUE DOWN THE TIMELINE AND WE GO TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. AND TODAY WE COMMAND MARTIN LUTHER KING FOR BEING ONE OF THE GREATEST CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS OF THIS TIME. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURES. IT WAS POLICE WHO WAS OFTENTIMES THE ADVERSARY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO WE HEROES CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST TO THIS DAY. SO TO CULTURAL POLICING IS NOT BEING TALKED ABOUT A POLICE ARE NOT BEING TRAINED ON THEIR OWN CULTURE. I WAS ACTUALLY WANTED PEOPLE WHO WAS ARRESTED IN A FAIR FORTIES RIGHT. AND WHILE WE SAT ON A BRIDGE FOR HOURS MY BROTHER WAS. HE WAS WITH ME MY YOUNGER BROTHER AND I BY SOME NOT TO TALK TO THE POLICE BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY THINGS SOMETIMES THE USE THAT AGAINST YOU. IN A COURT OF LAW BUT HE CAME OUT HE KEPT TRYING TO EDUCATE THE POLICE ON WILL YOU KNOW THE THE ORIGINS OF POLICE ARE RIGHT. YOU KNOW THAT YOU STARTED AS LAKE CATCHES YOU NOTICE COOL AND THE POLICE WERE OBLIVIOUS TO THIS KNOWLEDGE. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE FOUNDATION OF POLICING. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF THEIR RELATIONS WITHIN BLACK COMMUNITIES AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. SO WHERE BLACK PEOPLE REAL PEOPLE TRUST THE POLICE. WHAT ARE THE POLICE LOOKING AT IT IS ALWAYS A NEGATIVE CULTURE? DON'T HAVE A CULTURE OF NOT TRUSTING THE BUT ARE YOU BE A TRAINED IN YOUR FUNDAMENTAL A MANDATORY TRAINING ON YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. NOW I REALLY APPRECIATE IT WOULD THAT THE MARTINEZ SAID TO SAY BECAUSE HE BROUGHT UP SOME REALLY GOOD POINTS. SOME OF WEEKS. HE TALKED ABOUT. GUN VIOLENCE REALLY BEING A PRODUCT THE LOW RESOURCES ALCOHOL DRUG ABUSE -- POOR EDUCATION PIC POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND SO AGAIN WE FOLLOW THE TIMELINE AND WE LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE AND COMMUNITY. GUN VIOLENCE WITH THEIR POLICE HAS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP IN OUR COMMUNITIES YOU COULD. YOU CAN TRACE POLICE GUN VIOLENCE AND POLICE MURDER OTHER BLACK PEOPLE BACK TO THEIR FOUNDATION. BUT IT ALSO HAS AN INDIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES RIGHT SO AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HAD A BLACK POWER MOVEMENT WE HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF BLACK ACTIVIST MIGHT AFFECT WE HAD A WHOLE ORGANIZATION. THAT WAS CREATED A WHOLE ORGANIZATION OF BLACK STUDENTS OKAY FOR TO SAY LOOK THIS GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE TO STOP. THE ORGANIZATIONS KNOW THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY. NOON WHEN HE GOT HIS EDUCATION HE GOT HIS DOCTORATE EDUCATE THE WITH THE DOCTOR. AND FOR SOME REASON INSTEAD OF STANDING WITHIN THE ACADEMY INSTEAD OF JOINING WITHIN SOME OF THE SYSTEM TO CAME BACK WITH COMMUNITY CREATED AND A WHOLE ORGANIZATION DEAL WITH POLICE GUN VIOLENCE IN THAT COMMUNITY. THIS IS DOCUMENTED HISTORY. SO WHAT WAS THE PLEASES RESPONSE TO IT THEY ANALYZE HOW THEY PARTICIPATE WITH A GUN VIOLENCE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. THEY SAY WELL LET'S LET'S CHECK OUT SOME OF THE REASONS WE CHANGED SOME OF OUR POLICIES WE HAVE MORE TRAINING NO. THEY WENT UNDER COVER Q. THESE BLACK PANTHER PARTY MEMBERS THE STUDENTS AND AFTER THEIR THE GOVERNMENT OF WHICH THE POLICE IS COMPLICIT WHICH WAS A PART OF THE CIA CONTRA SCANDAL WAS PUT DRUGS INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND BROKE UP FAMILIES AND HELP SUPPORT MASS INCARCERATION. SO THESE THESE. THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALCOHOL ABUSE DRUG ABUSE EDUCATION POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS MENTAL HEALTH THAT'S A BY PRODUCT OF A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WAS GOING ON IN THE SIXTIES SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES THE POLICE HAVE A DIRECT. INDIRECT CONTRIBUTION TO THAT WHOLE MORE. TODAY DAMAGE TO THEIR DESTRUCTION. IT'S SO WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT REPAIR TOWARD JUSTICE WE START TALKING ABOUT REPARATIONS POLICE TO BE FRONTLINE ANNALS CONVERSATION. LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE FRONT LAWN IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS THEY SHOULD TRAIN OFF TO THE SAY WELL LOOK YOU KNOW WE'RE ABOUT PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES TO BUT WE HAVE HAD A HAND. IN RACISM WE HAVE HAD A HAND IN VIOLENCE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE DESTROYED SOME THINGS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE WE ORDER PRIMARY DESTRUCTION OF THE TRUST WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. UNIQUE POLICE AFTER ALL NAY UNTIL POLICE ARE READY TO ALL NET ANY TALK WITH DIVERSE CITY THAT WE HAVE WILL BE TRAINED OFF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE TODAY. THE BLACK PEOPLE HAVE A NEGATIVE CULTURE THAT WE DON'T TRUST POLICE OFFICERS BUT THERE'S NO REASONING AS TO WHY WE DON'T TRUST POLICE OFFICERS THERE'S NO REASONING AS TO WHY THIS CULTURE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED OVER THE LAST. TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE IS AS MUCH AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT NOW BACK IN THE FIFTIES FORTIES AND THIRTIES WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE DRUG VIOLENCE THAT IS THE GREAT A CULTURE. THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO PUT ON THE BLACK COMMUNITY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IS A BY PRODUCT OF THE EIGHTIES THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC AND THE VIOLENCE THAT CONSISTED WITHIN IT. A POLICE HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT STATE IT WE PLAYED A HAND WITHIN THAT IS WILL. THEY HAVE TO IF THERE'S NO REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT THEN THERE'S NO REAL CONVERSATION AT ALL IS PANDERING GUESS LET'S TAKE PICTURES THAT THE COMMUNITY CENTER. LET'S START TALKING THE KEY IS LET'S TRY TO GET SOME MORE BLACK PEOPLE SOME MORE BLACK FACES ON ON A ON OUR PLATE ME. LET LET'S GET SOME PEOPLE IN THE PICTURES THAT'S WHAT IT IS WE HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT REPAIRING THESE RELATIONSHIPS. AND PUSH A POLICY THAT REPAIRS IT IS WILL. WE LIGHT LIKE I SAY I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A PICTURE THE STEP WHEN IT COMES TO PASS A POLICY THAT COMMUNITIES ADVOCATE FOR WE TALKED ABOUT POLICE UNION SUPPORT IN THINGS LIKE REPARATIONS. SUPPORT THINGS LIKE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE SUPPORT THINGS LIKE -- NOT LETTING -- FAMILIES NONVIOLENT FELONS MARK IN IT BOX ONE EIGHT GO TRY TO GET A JOB TO GET SOME RESOURCES PLEASE YOUNG IS OFTEN TIMES AGAINST THE SIDES OF POLICIES. SO YOU'RE NOT FOR ANY TYPE OF RESTORATIVE REPAIR TÃ´I JUSTICE YOU JUST WANT PEOPLE TO BE QUIET. THIRTY SECONDS. I'M THE RIGHT THERE. THANK YOU LIST. LET ME SAY THAT THE BATTLE CERTAINLY GIVEN US A YEAR FULL AND I APPRECIATE THE PASSION. AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE -- WHAT YOU'VE COMMUNICATED THAT THUS FAR I WANT TO ASK TO THE BODY -- THE PANEL -- QUESTION WHOEVER WANTS TO CHOOSE TO A RESPOND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO SO -- IS ONE OF THINGS WE TRYING IS IS GAP INFORMATION AGAIN NOTES ARE BEING -- SUBSCRIBE AND IN TAKEN SO WE CAN CAPTURE -- ALL OF YOUR THOUGHTS THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE VIDEO TAPE SO WE CAN GO BACK AND MAKE SURE THAT WE PICKED UP OF ALL THE POINTS YOU BROUGHT OUT. BUT IN TERMS OF SOLUTION -- HOW HOW CAN LAW ENFORCEMENT CANDIDATES BE TRAINED BETTER IN HIGH STAKES SITUATIONS -- SO THAT GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT THE FIRST. RESORT. HOW CAN PLEASE OFFICES RETRAIN? SO THAT -- GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT THE FIRST RESORT NOW CERTAINLY DOCTOR WHEREVER PUT FOR THE BILL -- THREE NINETY TWO IS GOING TO LET THAT PROCESS AND IT ALSO THERE'S ANOTHER BILL DELIVER TRAINING -- WHICH SB TWO THIRTY TO GIVE ME YOUR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE TRAINING ASPECT OF IT -- FROM YOUR LANDS. WELL -- LIKE A LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER THIS IS A SOLUTIONS BASED I UNDERSTAND I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT YOU HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE AGAIN WE'RE NOT A MONOLITH WE ALL DON'T HAVE THE SAME IDEAS AS SAME UNDERSTAND MY PROGRAM THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW. IS SEXUAL STATE. THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDENTS INVOLVED OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BAD THUS FAR WOULD PROBABLY HAVE 80% A RECENT OF MINORITIES THEY HAVE TOLD ME STORIES. OF OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT HOW THEIR PARENTS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS IN TRAFFIC STOPS INVESTIGATION ONE OF THINGS THAT. IT TELLS ME. IS THAT IN SPITE OF THE TERRIBLE OR RIFIC THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THEIR PAST ARE CURRENTLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE LIKE I SAY I I WOULD BE IN THE SAME CATEGORY. THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN UP THEY ARE SAID I WANT TO DO BETTER NOT ONLY FOR MY FAMILY BUT FROM OUR FRIENDS AND AND FOR MY COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES US WHY SOME PORN ABOUT. TRYING TO CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY YOU CAN LOOK ANY DAY OF THE WEEK YOU CAN LOOK ON YOUTUBE OR LOOK ON GOOGLE OR SOMEPLACE. AND SEE A SOCIAL MEDIA OF VIDEO OVER OFFICERS ARE DOING TERRIBLE THINGS NO WAS DISCOUNTING THAT THE DOING TERRIBLE THINGS MY GOLDEN MY MY OBJECTIVE IS. TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE TO CHANGE ALL TERM SAY YES THIS IS WHY WE NEED A PROGRAM LIKE THIS TO GET RID OF A REMOVED ELIMINATE. THESE BAD OFFICERS SO IF YOU GET A POINTS AND THEIR BAD I GET THAT. WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INVIGORATE THE NEXT GENERATION TO HELP PREPARE THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN BECAUSE YOU TAKE THE ATTITUDE OF? I HATE THEM THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HELP ME THEN THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE LEFT AS WE GET TO THE POINT OF AN ARC AND I DON'T WANT TO GET IN THAT POINT ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT AGAIN USE ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS COUNTRY AND LAW FORCING THE POOR TO PROTECT. AND TO SERVE SO THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T WORK ON A MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT OF ALSO WORKED ON CULTURAL COMPANIES AND I REPEAT THAT OVER OVER AGAIN ABOUT THE PEOPLE WE HAVE. YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHATEVER THESE -- MEN TO COME AND CAN TALK TO THE STUDENTS AT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO YOUR WE WANT THEM TO LISTEN TO EVERY ASPECT EVERY PERSON I TALKED TO IN AMERICA OR ON THE STREETS A SEGMENT WHEN I WORKED. I WANNA MAKE SURE THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN AND THAT'S WHAT THE PROGRAM IS ALL ABOUT HOW DO WE ADDRESS WHEN IT COMES OUT TO PLEASE OFFICER TRAINING ABOUT -- SENSITIVITY TRAINING SPECIAL IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THIS DIVISION RAIN IS EXTREMELY POOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT A LOOK THE POLICE CULTURE ITSELF. IS BASED ON PROBABLY THREE pTHE POLICE. CHIEF HIM OR HERSELF. WHAT HE SAYS OR WHAT SHE SAYS MATTERS -- I'VE BEEN AROUND. CHIEFS IN THE PAST THEY'VE BEEN ASKED ABOUT THE RACISM THE TRAFFIC STOP THAT HAVE AN EXCESS NGUYEN AND RACIAL MINORITY ARE RAISING OF MINORITY COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY -- BLACK AND LATINO. AND THEY ALSO SAID YOU THINK YOU'RE DEPARTMENTS RACES AND THE CHIEF RESPONDED BY SAYING. WELL WE HAVE ISSUES OKAY THAT WAS RESPONSE EVEN SAY WE ARE RACES HE JUST THAT WE HAVE ISSUES HE WAS TRYING. TO WATER DOWN I GUESS IS THE ANSWER THEN THEY ASKED ME WELL WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO WHAT WOULD YOU CAN DO WHAT'S YOUR SOLUTION. AND HE HE HE HIM AND HAUNTING FINALLY SAID WELL MOST OF WHAT WE DO IS CORRECT AND I GOT CONCERNED WHEN I ACTUALLY READ THAT WE SAID MOST WHAT WE DO IS A FIFTY POINT 1% IS IT 708090% AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS EVEN AS I AS A BLACK. OFFICER THAT I HAD TO DO WITH IN THE SUIT SACRAMENTO I'M STILL LOOK FOR MY TOOK MY UNIFORM OFF A LOOK THE SAME AS ANYONE ELSE WHATEVER OF CULT AND I'M SURE THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO YOU TOO WHEN YOU'RE IN UNIFORM. SO YOU HAVE A ROLE I HAVE I'M TRYING TO DO WITH OTHERS AS WELL TO MENTOR. THESE YOUNG MEN TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO THE CHIEF. HIS POLICIES ARE HER POLICIES AND THEN IT'S THE RANK AND FILE THE RANK AND FILE DO WHATEVER THE CHIEF SAYS. SO IF WE CAN CHANGE THE CULTURE OF THE CHIEF OKAY AND GET HIM AND HER OR REMEMBER TO SAY IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE THE DATA THAT WE HEARD FROM -- DOCTOR MARTINEZ AND OTHERS TO TELL ABOUT THEIR STORES NO ONCE ELIMINATE THE STORES THAT'S NOT THE POINT THE POINT IS TO SAY WHAT WE DO WITH THIS INFORMATION HOW WE'RE GONNA GO FOR IT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO. WITH THE PROGRAM THAT'S WHY SAID WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THUS FAR BECAUSE THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THEY COULD THEY READ THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY YEARS OF AGE. THEY COULD EASILY SAY. I DON'T LIKE HOPS WITH THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE COME FROM LOW ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS MOST IN THE IN THE PROGRAM THEY SAID. I WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS CHANGE THE OUTCOME AND HOPE AND THEY DO THE SAME THING. WHO YOU TRYING TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME? FOR I'M NOT. I'M JUST SAYING. I JUST I KNOW I I KEEP WE KEEP ON HEARING THE SAME KINDA LIKE. IT'S GOING BACK TO TRAINING TRAINING TRAINING THE OUTCOME HAS TO BE. OUR MY BOTTOM LINE SOLUTION IS YOU HAVE TO FIRE THE OFFICERS -- WHEN THEY'RE BEING TRAINED THEY HAVE TO KNOW? THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN POLICY OF YOU BREAK YOU WILL GET FIRED YOU GET TERMINATED. AND THAT'S NOT BEING DONE BECAUSE OF THE POWERFUL POLICE UNION BECAUSE THE POLICE BILL OF RIGHTS THESE THINGS THAT ARE IN PLACE THIS POLICIES THAT ARE IN PLACE THAT PROTECT POLICE. SO WE KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO TRAIN PEOPLE TO NOT BE RACIST. TRYING TO REPROGRAM A CULTURE THAT HAVE PROBABLY BEEN THERE BEFORE CHIEF WE HAD ARMED POLICE SUMMERS THAT WAS HERE BEFORE -- CHIEF HAN WAS HERE CHIEF HAN JUST CAME INTO ANOTHER QUOTE TO ARE THE CULTURAL SUMMERS HE HAS TO TAKE YEARS TO CREATE THE CULTURE HE'S TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHICH THE REALITY IS WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. IS IF THERE IS NO ALL CONSEQUENCES POLICE CONTINUE TO RUN ROLE. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WE HAD A LAW THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHO ARE THE OFFICERS THAT HAVE HAD -- YOU'LL MISCONDUCT AND IT WAS A FIGHT FOR EVEN THAT TO COME OUT AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BEING PLACED IN LAW FORGET WHAT THE LAW WAS. BUT IT WAS JUST PASSED LAST YEAR THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE OFFICERS THAT HAD MISCONDUCT ON THAT WERE MISPLACED WITH THIS THAT. I FORGET. OKAY YOU SAID THANK YOU SO THESE KIND OF THINGS WHEN YOU HAVE A A WHOLE COLLECTION OF OFFICERS THROUGHOUT AMERICA NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE WILLING TO PROTECT THEIR OWN. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SERVICE SINGING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BETTER TRAINING THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK IT'S EASY FOR POLICE OFFICER TO TO GIVE OUT TURKEYS AT ON THANKSGIVING IT'S EASY FOR POLICE OFFICERS TO GIVE OUT BIKES ON CHRISTMAS WHEN THESE KIDS ARE FIVE YEARS OLD. WHEN THAT KID NOW BECOMES THIRTEEN YEARS OLD WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT NUMBER TO BE PUSHED BACK ON ON SOMETHING YOU SAID? IS IT PUT TRAINING WON'T WORK WHAT TELL ME WHAT WILL WORK BECAUSE BY YOUR THE OFFICERS THAT COULD MEET. VIS A NEUTRAL SHOES THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO OUR COMMUNITY IF AN OFFER SIR HOLD ON IF AN OFFICER SARS IMPLEMENTED WOULD GET OUT. OFFICER KILLS AN UNARMED BLACK PERSON OR ANY PERSON. AND THERE WAS NO THREAT THEY USE EXCESSIVE FORCE. THAT OFFICER SHOULD BE DRUG TESTED SO WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT IN THE OFFICES SYSTEM BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND POLICING IS A DIFFICULT DO WE WE HAVE OFFICES PROBABLY WORK A TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHIPS. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ALL OFFICERS ARE JUST DRINKING COFFEE SO LIFT. DRUG TEST OFFICERS SO TO BE NO SHADOW OF DOUBT TO FIGURE OUT THE MINDSET AND IF THERE WAS NO REASONABLE RESENTFUL OFFER SIR TO USE THIS TYPE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE. THE OFFICER SHOULD BE FAR WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. SO A PERSON CAN BE TERMINATED FOR BREAKING RULES OF BREAKING POLICIES WHAT ABOUT TRAINING WHAT ABOUT AN INMATE IS ALSO SAY THIS WHEN I WAS A POLICE OFFICER. I HAD TO ENGAGE I KNEW EVERYBODY'S. EVERY LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH I REPRESENTED AS A POLICE OFFICER I KNEW MAMAS AND DADDIES NAME. I KNEW THEIR SONS I HAD TO GET OUT A CAR I HAD TO WALK THE STREETS WE HAD COMMUNITY BASED POLICING WHERE BY WHICH WE ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY SO WE KNEW. THAT IF. MR LOPEZ SON WAS ACTING UP OR HE WAS SEEN SOMEWHERE YOU SHOULD BE INSANE AND WE CAN PICK HIS LOW I CAN'T THAT ON TV. OKAY WE PICKED HIM UP. AND WE TOOK A MOM AND TOLD MOM AND DAD. AND BUT THAT WAS THE TRAINING THAT WAS INGRAINED IN IN ME AS A POLICE OFFICER BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE TRAINING IN ORDER TO CHECK TO TRYING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE THE YOU SPEAK OF AND I BELIEVE THAT A STARTS THERE. TELL ME SOMETHING IN TERMS OF OF ANOTHER SOLUTION IF IS NOT TRYING TO BECAUSE WE CAN FAR EVERYBODY BUT WHO DO WE NARAL CREATE AND TEACH. THAT'S GOING TO COME IN AND TAKE OVER THE SERVICES TO BITTER THAT WHEN PEOPLE CALL 911- THERE'S PEOPLE RESPOND WHO'S BEEN TRAINED. BECAUSE EVERY PERSON OF COLOR EVERY MAN WHO WALKING DOWN THE STREET WAS PASSING IT I'M YOU KNOW SAGGING IS NOT INVOLVED IN GANGS BUT YOU DON'T WE KNOW THAT IF YOU'VE BEEN TRAINED TO TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT PERSON NOT AFFILIATED WITH GANGS. IF THE FAT IS THE FASHION STATEMENT RIGHT. IT GOES TO TRAINING AND SO I JUST NEED SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN'T DESPITE EVERYBODY WE HAVE TO TRAIN SO HELP ME. WITH RESPECT TO OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS EITHER TRAINING OR SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL WHAT WHEN WERE YOU A POLICE OFFICER. I'M SORRY WHEN WE WERE POLICE OFFICER WHERE DO YOU MAY WOULD MEAN EIGHTY FORM. WITHIN EIGHTY SO IS THE NINETIES NICE. YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION A LOT. WE WANT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE -- ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- CITY COME LIKE A DOVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL FOR BEING HERE AND SHOULD BE A WAY IN A FEW MONTHS MISTER ROBERTS. A YEAR -- I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO TRAINING WILL WILL FOR SOME SPEAK ON A A LITTLE BIT OF DISPARATE OF THE ACTIVITY SO I THINK THAT. I JUST FIND A LITTLE BIT HYPOCRITICAL JUST BECAUSE WE WANT DESIRE SOCIAL OUTCOMES WE SET LAWS AROUND THOSE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT. WHEN WE SAY THAT WE DON'T WANT MURDER IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE WON'T WANT VIOLENCE WE DON'T WON'T -- BURGLARIES WE DON'T WANNA ROBBERIES WE SAID A PUNISHMENT FOR DAY AND WE'RE STRICT ON IT WE ANYTIME TO PEOPLE VIOLATE THOSE TALK TO TERMS WE SAY. MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR WE HAVE TO KIND OF THIS PUNITIVE NATURE OF DEALING WITH AND CREATING A SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WE SEE FIT. WHEN IT COMES TO POLICE GUN VIOLENCE WE DON'T HAVE THAT WE START TALKING ABOUT STRICTLY TRAINING YOU KNOW THERE'S NO PUNITIVE WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANY? PUNITIVE -- CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE ACTIONS UNLESS YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST EVEN WONDER SUPER BLATANT YOU KNOW ON AREN'T DO DIDN'T HAVE A GUN HE DID HAVE A WEAPON. WE KILLED HIM WE DIDN'T DE ESCALATE HOW ARE TRAINING TELLS US TO DE ESCALATE TWO YEAR OLD. WE DID WE DIDN'T ANNOUNCE OURSELVES AS POLICE OFFICERS WE DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T TELL IT WOULD YOU KNOW A WHOLE BUNCH OF THE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES THAT WE HAVE AN ALL POLICING AND WE DID IT. ABIDE BY THOSE RULES BUT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO SAY THAT OKAY WE'RE SORRY WE'RE GOING TO PLAY FEET LET YOU GO SOMEONE LOST THEIR LIFE. YOU WORK IN MAKE DONALD AND YOU. SLEEP BEING YOU KNOW YOU TO LET YOU SOBRE SLEEP DON'T HIT THE CLARK YOU KNOW YOU FAILED TO SHOW UP TO YOUR SHIFT HEY YOU DON'T COST AS A THIS COMPANY. CASTING LOSS AND SO WE DON'T HAVE TO LET YOU GO YOU SLIPPED INTO LATE BUT WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE THEY KILL SOMEONE THAT TAKES SOME OF LIFE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK. YOU AFFECTED THE THE WHOLE FAMILY IN THIS COMMUNITY YOU MAY AFFECTED A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE'S NO MANDATORY THING GOV OKAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LET YOU GO MOST TIMES. WE ACTUALLY KEEP GOING TO FORCE YOU GET PAID LEAVE THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO THERE'S NO TYPE OF PUNITIVE. PUNITIVE CONSEQUENCE FOR IT OR NO INCENTIVE I MEAN BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO CREATE SOME TYPE OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR THAT'S DESIRABLE THERE'S REALLY TWO WAYS TO LOOK AT IT RIGHT YOU CAN CREATE A SENTENCE TO IT OR YOU CAN CREATE. A PUNISHMENT FOR BUT THERE'S NEED THE WAR IS JUST LEFT TO WILL YOU KNOW LESS WORK ON TRAINING. SO I THINK THAT TRAINING IS IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THAT WHEN TRAINING FALL SHORT WE HAVE TO HAVE THESE THINGS ESTABLISH HIS WILL WHEN IT COMES A TRAIN NOT THINK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME TO GOOD THANK YOU YOU HAVE MITCHELL CRISIS IS FOR SHOW. BUT I THINK THAT NGUYEN ANALYZING THE PROBLEM WITHIN HOLE THEN WE HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE BIGGER THINGS THAT WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT WITHOUT START TALKING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF POLICING WE HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT THE CULTURE OF POLICING. WE HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT THE RESOURCES IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND EDUCATED OFFICERS BASED OFF OF STAMP POINTS. WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU GUYS HAVE GIVEN US A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION TO PONDER OVER AND FOR US TO CAPTURE -- I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE OF THEM BUT OUR NEXT PANEL UP -- WE WOULD ASK YOU STAY CLOSE YOU MAY WANT TO ASK OTHER QUESTIONS -- OVER A POSSIBLE MATCH SO -- ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- CITY COME LIKE A DOVE CAN INTRODUCE HERSELF AND HERE YOU GO HERE'S THANK YOU -- WELL THANK YOU ALL. FOR MISTER CHAIR MISTER GIBSON -- FOR CONVENING THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND FOR INVITING ME TO BE A MEMBER -- MY NAME IS SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE OF I AM THE SIMPLY WOMAN FOR THE FIFTY FOURTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES LOS ANGELES -- SOME PARTS OF INGLEWOOD AND ALL OF CULVER CITY -- WHY IS THIS ISSUE IMPORTANT TO ME AND MY DISTRICT -- WELL IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE I AM THE WIFE OF A BLACK MAN AND THE STEP MOTHER OF TWO BLACK CHILDREN. AND I WANT TO SEE THEM GROW OLD AND FEEL SAFE. IN ANY COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY TRAVEL -- AND FROM WATCHING MOVIES ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE FROM HEARING STORIES -- WHEN I'M AT HOME ABOUT VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE AND ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT ARE BLACK AND ARE BROWN AND ARE ASIAN BROTHERS HAVE -- WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN WITH GUNS WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT AND I THINK IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK ABOUT THOSE SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP. THAT BLACK AND BROWN MEN AND WOMEN IN COMMUNITIES HAVE WITH GUNS IN GUN VIOLENCE -- AND THAT IS BOTH. AT THE INTERACTION THAT FOLKS HAVE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT THEN JUST THE INTERACTION WE HAVE WITH GUNS. I TALKED TO FOLKS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE AN INORDINATE NUMBER OF GUN BILLS THAT COME THROUGH PUBLIC SAFETY. AND PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO BE HAVING IS IS INHERENTLY RACIST AND DISCRIMINATORY SYSTEM THAT FOCUSES HEAVILY ON PROFILING. AND IT IS VERY HARD TO CREATE GOOD POLICY ON TOP OF QUICKSAND. AND TO ASSUME THAT THAT GOOD POLICY IS GOING TO SOMEHOW SUPERSEDE THIS INHERENTLY RACIST FOUNDATION UPON WHICH WERE PLACING THESE NEW LAWS. AND SO WHY DON'T WE BEGIN TO UNRAVEL ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND HAVE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. A SPECIFIC VERY GENDER SPECIFIC VERY TRAUMA SPECIFIC CONVERSATIONS AROUND TRAUMA AND VIOLENCE IN COMMUNITIES. PEOPLE LIKE TO ASSUME THAT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE LIKE TO SHOOT FOLKS UP EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT. BUT I WILL ALSO ARGUE THAT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES ARE SOME OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO CERTAIN PRINCIPLES AND VALUES SYSTEMS AND SO THERE IS A DISCONNECT WITH HOW WE ARE TREATED. AND HOW WE ARE PROFILED IN HOW WE ACTUALLY ACT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER AND ABOUT HOW WE HANDLE CONFLICT. AND HOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRAINED TO DO. WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD WE SHOULD DO AND WHAT IS PART OF WHO WE ACTUALLY ARE IN OUR CULTURE AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO? AND I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE AS A CULTURE ONE AT A RADIC KATE. ARE OUR FUTURE. BY KILLING. YOU KNOW OUR NEXT GENERATION WE ARE FOCUSED NOW ON TRYING TO HEAL. AND TO MOVE OURSELVES INTO THE SPOTLIGHT TO SAY WE ARE HERE. AND WE ARE HOLE. WE ARE HURTING. BUT WE ARE HOLE. I'M NOT LESS OF A HUMAN BECAUSE I'M A BLACK MAN -- SO WHY DON'T WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT VIOLENCE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THREE WEEKS AGO A GENTLEMAN IN BEL AIR. WAS FOUND TO HAVE OVER A THOUSAND GUNS. IN HIS HOME. THAT WAS ON THE NEWS FOR THIRTY FIVE SECONDS AND THEN NO ONE TALKED ABOUT HIM. NO ONE TALKED ABOUT THOSE GUNS NO ONE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH THEM [inaudible] WHY NOT? SO THAT'S WHY I'M HERE I KNOW I'VE TALKED A LITTLE LONGER THAN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BASED ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ASSEMBLY ONE WE APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT. NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE UP THIS THE NEXT PANEL -- GUN VIOLENCE. IN GANGS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- IF DOC MARTINEZ I WAS A PLEASE -- COME BACK AND JOIN US AGAIN WE WANT ALSO INVITE -- SAM BOND PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF RICHMOND -- OFFICE OF NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY AND KENNY GREEN I'M PROGRAM MANAGER FOR GANG INTERVENTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF THE TOBIN MEN -- NEIGHBORHOODS -- CENTER WHICH YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AND PLEASE JOIN US AT THE TABLE. WE WILL START OFF WITH -- MISTER GREEN YOU CAN JUST -- PLEASE INTRODUCEYOURSELF AND THEN WE WILL INVITE MR BONTA NEWS HIMSELF AND THEN -- WILL HAVE DOCTOR MARTINEZ -- WHICH ARE DATA WITH REGARDS TO A GAL GUN VIOLENCE IN GAMES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. OF THANK YOU GERMAN -- VERY HONORED TO BE HERE SHARING THE SPACE WITH YOU ALL THE HERE AND NOW SACRAMENTO. MY NAME IS KENNY GREEN AND ALL OVERSEE ALL THE GANG INTERVENTION -- ACTIVITIES DOWN IN THE HARBOR OF THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES -- AT TOBER NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER KIND OF BEEN AROUND FOR A COUPLE DAYS SINCE -- NINETEEN OH THREE DOING SOME GOOD WORK AND THEN MOVING TO SAN PEDRO AND I'LL CONTINUE THAT WORK. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE SAM ON THE CITY OF RICHMOND OFFICE NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY PROGRAM MANAGER ALSO RESIDENT OF RICHMOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US -- DOC MARTINEZ OKAY -- GOOD TO BE BACK. AGAIN SECOND TIME TODAY -- AND TODAY'S OR IN THIS PORTION OF THE DISCUSSION. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT -- ACCESS IN MOTIVATIONS. FOR GUN VIOLENCE -- IN SAN DIEGO. AND WHAT THIS TALK AGAIN EVEN THOUGH MY DATE -- AND RESEARCH IS BASED IN SAN DIEGO IT HAS BROADER IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S A LOT OF PARALLELS WHAT WE SEE IN SAN DIEGO -- THAT WE SEE AN LOS ANGELES AND ALL THE OTHER MID SIZE CITIES -- IN CALIFORNIA. SO LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- SOME OF MY RESEARCH -- SO STARTING IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I CONDUCTED. AN ETHNOGRAPHY OF THREE DIFFERENT POLICE GAIN UNITS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THIS IS THE WAY THAT I GATHERED MOST OF MY DATA -- I RODE WITH UNITS FOR ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE HOURS ON THURSDAYS AND FRIDAYS. AND ADDITIONALLY I SPENT CLOSE TO TWO YEARS OBSERVING THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO'S POLICE DEPARTMENT GANG UNIT. RIDING WITH THEM TWO TO THREE TIMES PER WEEK EVERY. SIX SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS I KNOW THE OFFICERS ARE THE GANG UNITS PRETTY WELL HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL. SO THESE FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS OBSERVING PLEASE GANG UNITS INFORM MY WORK TODAY. AND GIVEN THE SEEM OF GUN VIOLENCE IN GANGS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DISCUSS -- WHAT MY FINDINGS WERE? AND WHEN I WAS COLLECTING DATA WAS TRYING TO ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS. THE FIRST QUESTION IS -- WHERE DO GUNS COME FROM USED IN HOMICIDES OR SHOOTINGS AND SECOND WHY DO PEOPLE CARRY THEM WHAT ARE THE MOTIVATIONS FOR KAREN SO? IF THIS SOUNDS FAMILIAR ON BUILDING ON THE TALK I GAVE EARLIER TALKING ABOUT ACCESS AND MEANINGS -- FOR HAVING GUNS -- SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FINDINGS. SO -- MY FINDINGS ARE. BASED ON PATROL OBSERVATIONS WERE PART OF THE DATA CAME FROM AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DISCOVERED. WAS ABOUT 3240% OF ALL WEAPONS RECOVERED FROM SHOOTINGS -- FROM SHOOTINGS IN HIGH HOMICIDES WERE TRAFFICKED [inaudible] FROM ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO SO HERE ARE MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT SAN DIEGO -- AND SO THESE ARE JUST -- INTERVIEWS I DID WITH POLICE OFFICERS FROM THE GANG UNIT. AND I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THAT LARGE PERCENT PERCENTAGE OF HAND GUNS CAME FROM OUT OF STATE PRIMARILY ARIZONA -- THE REMAINING GUNS. WERE STOLEN -- AND WEIRD WHEN WERE TAKEN FROM FAMILY MEMBERS WHO OWNED FIREARMS MOST OF THE WEAPONS USED WERE SMALL HAND GUNS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIRTY EIGHT TWENTY TWOS FORTY FIVES AND NOT TYPICALLY THE ASSAULT WEAPONS THAT WE HEAR ABOUT IN MASS SHOOTINGS. SO SOME OF THE OTHER DAY THE THAT I HAVE THEM WITH TALK ABOUT TODAY WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE DA'S OFFICE AS WELL AS WE ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH SOME OF THE THEIR HOMICIDE FILES. NOT SO I WAS ABLE TO GET THE THE DATA ON THE TYPES OF HANDGUNS USE. SO THE POINT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE FIRST IS IT WE SHOULDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE NEED TO REGULATE SMALL HAND GUNS SINCE THEY ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE. FOR MOST HOMICIDES BUT THAT STILL BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T REGULATE ASSAULT WEAPONS BUT MOST OF THE GUN ONCE IN COMMITTEES OF COLOR ARE COMMITTED BY SMALL HANDGUNS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- MY FINDINGS NEED TO GO FURTHER AND WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE WE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS INVESTIGATE NOT ONLY THE SECONDARY SOURCES. BUT THE PRIMARY SOURCES WHEN I SAY PRIMARY SOURCES WE NEED TO NOTE DIRECTLY WHICH GUN DEALERS. IN PLACES LIKE ARIZONA WHERE THESE GUNS ARE COMING FROM SO THAT WE CAN PROSECUTE -- THOSE BUSINESSES FOR SELLING THEM OR TRY TO INVESTIGATE HOW THEY ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO USE THEM -- FOR HOMICIDES. SO WHAT MY OBSERVATIONS SUGGESTED THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF GUNS USED TO COMMIT MURDER IN BLACK AND BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS -- THERE ARE USING GANG RELATED ACTIVITY COME FROM OUT OF STATE. SO THIS SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR FEDERAL POLICY REFORM TO DEAL WITH GUN VIOLENCE. SO -- HERE'S AN ILLUSTRATION THIS IS FROM -- THE NEW YORK TIMES -- IN RESEARCHERS HAVE PICKED UP ON THIS FIRST FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER TO CALIFORNIA IF YOU pINTO SAN DIEGO YOU CAN SEE HOW A LOT OF THE ERROR WAS GOING FROM ARIZONA TO CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S BECAUSE A GUN LAWS TEND TO BE. MORE LAX IN PLACES LIKE ARIZONA END OF THAT AND SO IT'S A LOT EASIER TO GET. HAND GUNS [inaudible] LEGALLY. AND THEN TO TRANSPORT THEM INTO PLACES. LIKE -- SAN DIEGO [inaudible] SO -- THE GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATES THE TRAIN WE SEE IN SAN DIEGO FARMS BEING TRAFFICKED TO CALIFORNIA FROM ARIZONA BECAUSE OF THE WEEK LAWS. IN MANY OF THE GUNS ARE LEGALLY PURCHASED ACCORDING TO THE OFFICERS THAT I SPOKE WITH. AND IF GOING TO SORT OF RELATE THIS TO GANG VIOLENCE OR GANG VIOLENCE IS A PROBLEM BUT IT IS FURTHER FUELLED. WHEN GAINING WHEN GANGS ARE ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO WEAPONS? AND THERE'S IT'S NOT A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS -- THE ACCESS TO GUNS AS WELL FOR GONNA TALK ABOUT GANG VIOLENCE AND HOW PEOPLE GET THESE HAND GUNS -- I ALSO DID SOME HAVE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ON A RELATED PROJECT -- AND A IT HERE IN SACRAMENTO DID GETTING ENFORCEMENT TEAM PEOPLE THAT I'VE TALKED TO AN INTERVIEW THAT TOLD ME THAT. MOST OF THE HAND GUNS USED IN HOMICIDES IN SHOOTINGS IN SACRAMENTO COME FROM NEVADA. SO THAT'S ALSO ONE OF THE FLOW CHARTS YOU SEE THERE ARE THERE'S AN ARROW COMING FROM THE VADA BUT FROM THE OFFICERS I TALK TO YOU. THERE'S A LOT OF HAND GUNS COMING FROM THE VET -- INTO SACRAMENTO AND FEELING A LOT OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE PLACES THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER -- IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO AND IN -- DEL PASAL HEIGHTS. NOW LET ME JUST SAY THIS NOW BECAUSE I KNOW POLICIES IMPORTANT -- FOR FOR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND IT FOR YOUR OFFICE SO WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OF MY FINDINGS HERE. WELL WHAT CAN BE DONE SO THE ATF TRACES THE SERIAL NUMBER TO FIND OUT THE SOURCE OF THE MANUFACTURER IN DEALER. TO THE WEAPON WAS PURCHASED FROM BUT AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW OR MAYBE SOME OF YOU DON'T KNOW THERE IS NO FEDERAL. DATABASE THAT KEEPS TRACK OF GUNS THAT ARE PURCHASED SO I THINK THAT'S AN ONGOING -- PROBLEM -- PEOPLE THINK IT'S SO YOU CAN JUST TYPE THE NUMBER INTO A COMPUTER IT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS ARE LITERALLY. YOU HAVE TO USE LIKE A CARD INDEX I WAS JUST FROM THE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY REALLY HAVE TO GO TO A CARD INDEX. AND MAKE A REQUEST AND IT TAKES MONTHS SOMETIMES FOR THE A TF -- TO GET THE SERIAL NUMBER ON THESE WEAPONS. WHAT ABOUT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- STRAYS DATA FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IS COLLECTED BUT IT'S NOT DONE IN A SYSTEMIC SYSTEMATIC ORGANIZED HUESO THAT'S ONE THING THAT CAN BE DONE. IS -- TO HAVE A CALL FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO HAVE A DEVELOPED DATABASE TO TRACK WEAPONS COMING INTO THE CITY HOMICIDE DETECTIVES ALREADY DO THAT BUT THEY DON'T IT'S NOT REALLY FULLY DEVELOPED. DATABASE THAT'S MEANT TO BE SHARED. WITH OTHER POLICYMAKERS AND THEN AT THE STATE LEVEL MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A DATABASE. I'M NOT SURE HOW FULLY DEVELOPED IT IS BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH. REVSITING WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S DATABASE LOOKS LIKE. FOUR SERIAL NUMBERS -- AND HOW THE STATE CAN COOPERATE WITH CITIES TO TRY TO FIND OUT THE ORIGINS OF GUNS USED. IN SHOOTING SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THREE THINGS. THE POLICY IN. THE SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE I THINK FURTHER EXPLORED THAT MIGHT BE A TAKE AWAY -- FROM THE STOCK. SO -- FOR THIS PORTION OF THE TALK WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS CLEARLY STRICTER GUN REGULATIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ARE NEAT ARE NEEDED. AND THERE'S A TAKE AWAY FROM THIS AND THAT IS RED STATES AND THEIR GUN LAWS ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR GUN VIOLENCE IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND IT'S NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND WE GET A BAD RAP IN CALIFORNIA IS BEING A VIOLENT PLACE -- YOU KNOW FULL OF KINGS BUT IT TURNS OUT A LOT OF THE VIOLENCE ITS FUEL THAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONS FROM GUNS IN NEIGHBORING RED STATES THAT HAVE. WEAK GUN LAWS SO I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING -- THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED A PROGRAM TALK ABOUT GANGS IN GUN VIOLENCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEREFORE IS CONTRIBUTING TO GUN VIOLENCE IN AREAS OF DISADVANTAGE. RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT. WHERE HOW GUNS ARE REQUIRED ON THE STREETS THAT ARE USED? IN HOMICIDES. SO THE SECOND LEADING WAY FIREARMS ARE REQUIRED IS THROUGH THEFT. BASED ON INTERVIEWS AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT STAFF THAT THIS IS THE SECOND MOST COMMON WAY IN THIS USUALLY HAPPENS. IN HOME ROBBERIES OF TALK TO POLICE OFFICERS INTERVIEWED THEM IN WHAT PEOPLE DO IS I'LL TRY TO GAIN INTEL ON PEOPLE IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY. ONE EXAMPLE I WAS GIVEN -- IS SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL GO TO SHOOTING RANGE. THEY'LL SEE WHO HAS THE EXPENSIVE GUN LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE MONEY AND PEOPLE FOLLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS HOME THE CASE THEIR HOME. AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT THEY MIGHT ROB THAT HOUSE FOR THAT GUN OR IT COULD BE SOMEBODY DOING SOME WORK IN YOUR HOME IF THEY HEAR THERE'S A GUN THERE. THEY'LL ROB THAT HOUSE -- THE SECOND MOST COMMON WAYS WHAT'S KNOWN AS A SMASH AND GRAB -- SO IN SACRAMENTO THERE WAS A RASH OF ROBBERIES AT GUN STORES WERE PEOPLE WOULD BACK THEIR CARS UP INTO A GUN STORE. AND THEN JUST A PILE OF PEOPLE WOULD JUMP OUT AND THEY WOULD TRY TO JUST PACK AS MANY GUNS AS A KIDS OF THEFT. IS A VERY COMMON WAY THAT GUNS GET IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM -- THEN THE THIRD MOST COMMON WAY IN THIS IS. GONNA BE THE CHALLENGE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE COUNTRY NOW IT WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE GHOST GUNS. GHOST GUNS -- ARE INCREASINGLY USED IN HOMICIDES IN IN GAME VIOLENCE AS WELL -- IN THE FIRST THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT WAYS OF THREE VERSIONS OF GOES GUNS I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THAT I'VE DISCOVERED IN MY RESEARCH THE FIRST. IS THE THREE D. PRINTERS. SO -- THREE D. PRINTERS ARE NOW BECOMING MORE COMMON YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH PRINT ANYTHING WITH A THREE D. PRINTER. AND GUNS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING USED IN THE BLACK MARKET AND AND THERE'S NO WAY OF TRACING SERIAL NUMBERS BACK BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ONE RIGHT SO THAT'S THAT'S THIS IS GONNA BE A CHALLENGE I THINK FOR POLICY MAKERS. THE SECOND TYPE OF GOES GUN IS WHERE MAYBE A PERSON HOUSE THE BOTTOM PART OF A GUN. AND THEY'RE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE OTHER PART ONLINE SO YOU CAN BUY GUNS IN PIECES -- THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR THE GANG IT WAS ACTUALLY THE TYPE OF GUN THE KILLED TERRIBLE SOLD IN I THINK IT WAS AN A. R. HE WAS AN ASSAULT RIFLE THAT HAD DIFFERENT PARTS. THAT WERE PURCHASED ONLINE IS A HOMEMADE GUN. AND THEN THE THIRD TYPE OF GOES GUN -- ARE THESE ARE GUNS THAT ARE STOLEN IN BULK FROM FACTORIES THEY GET IN BEFORE -- SERIAL NUMBERS ARE PRINTED ON THEM -- AND THERE'S NO WAY TO TRACE THEM BACK SO ALL THESE ARE VERSIONS OF GOES GUNS THEY'RE VERY PROBLEMATIC THEY CAN'T BE TRACED BACK AND THEY ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON -- AMONGST -- GANGS. OKAY LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MOTIVATIONS NOW SO I TALKED ABOUT THE ACCESS ONE TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPES. OF GUN RELATED HOMICIDES AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO SAN DIEGO AGAIN. AS A WINDOW INTO THE INTO THE REST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND INTO THE COUNTRY. AND AS TALK ABOUT CRIME -- SO ABOUT 10% AND THIS IS JUST BE JUST PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM. THE CORONER'S OFFICE FILES I GOT FROM OTHER QUARTERS OFFICE IN THE DA'S OFFICE. ABOUT 10% OF GUNS USED IN HOMICIDES WERE A RESULT OF A ROBBERY. AND 3%. WERE. DRUG MOTIVATED AND LOW ALSO GIVE YOU A VERY COMMON TYPE OF DRUG RELATED -- ROBBERY THANK YOU SEE HERE IN SACRAMENTO SO INCREASINGLY IN SACRAMENTO THEY HAVE WHAT'S KNOWN AS WE TRIPS -- EVEN THOUGH MARIJUANA IS LEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S A LOT CHEAPER TO BUY IT ON THE BLACK MARKET BECAUSE OF THE TAX BECAUSE YOU GET IT BECAUSE IT GETS TAX. SO THERE'S A HUGE UNDERGROUND OF MARIJUANA INFORMAL MARKET IN SACRAMENTO AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL GET ROB WILL SET UP OF A FAKE DEAL. PEOPLE WILL WILL GET ROB THEN WHEN PEOPLE DON'T COOPERATE TO GET KILLED SO CORPS IN THE SACK PD THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF GUN RELATED HOMICIDE THAT WE SEE IN PLACES LIKE. DEL PASO HEIGHTS OR IN CELL SACRAMENTO -- OKAY MOVING ALONG -- GANG RELATED THIS SECTION IS ON GAMING'S. AND SO -- A SIGNIFICANT PERCENT. OF GUN RELATED HOMICIDES -- OR GANG RELATED 39% OF HOMICIDES INVOLVING HOMICIDE OR FARMS WERE GANG RELATED. AT WERE IN THIS THE WAY THAT THEY DETERMINE WHETHER WAS GETTING THAT WAS THE SHOOTER AND OR VICTIM IS DOCUMENTED DOCUMENTED. AS A GANG MEMBER GANG RIVALRIES CONSTITUTED ABOUT 13% IN AGAIN WHY WORRY WAS 8% LET ME JUST PAUSE HERE FOR A SECOND -- WHEN WE USE THE GANG THE THE TERM GAINING -- IT'S I THINK IT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC WE HAVE TO APPROACH THIS CONCEPT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION. WHY DO WE NEED TO PROCEED IN A CAUTIOUS WAY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT? GANGS. WELL FIRST OF ALL GETTING IS A FLUID CONCEPT THAT USE USE FOR PROTECTION -- IN ITS INCREASINGLY LESS IMPORTANT SENSE NEIGHBORHOOD IDENTITY OFTEN TRUMP'S GETTING A JENNY SO USEFUL USES I'M GONNA GAME BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY JUST KIND OF USE IT TO KIND OF PROTECT THEMSELVES. SO THAT'S A PROBLEM. THE BIGGER PROBLEM THOUGH IS THE TENDENCY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SEE COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE GANG LANDS AND I THINK WE NEED TO IT REQUIRES. GREATER - INVESTIGATION TO TRY TO FIND OUT IF A SHOOTING WAR CRIME IS IN FACT -- GANG RELATED -- AND SO THE CHALLENGE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND POLICY MAKERS IS TRY TO UNPACK THE UNIQUENESS OF GUN RELATED HOMICIDE AND WE SHOULDN'T BE QUICK JUST TO SAY. THAT IT'S GANG RELATED -- AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS GAINES THAT AS A AS A PROBLEM -- AS WELL. OKAY SO THAT'S A GANG RELATED. HOMICIDES. AND THEN THE LAST MOTIVATION THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS -- WHAT I'M CALLING INTERPERSONAL -- GUN RELATED HOMICIDES. 40% OF A FIREMAN HOMES INVOLVED INTERPERSONAL CONFLICT. 21%. OF THAT 40% WERE DOMESTIC -- AND SO. IF YOU'RE FOR POLICE OFFICER I'M SURE I'M SURE YOU'VESEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN POLICE OFFICERS GO ON A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALL. THESE ARE SITUATIONS IT CAN ESCALATE VERY QUICKLY -- THIS IS ACTUALLY THE THE INCIDENT THAT -- TERRACE ALL SOLVING THE MENTION A NAME AGAIN WAS EXPOSED TO WIND WHEN SHE WAS SHOT -- SO -- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A OFTEN OF COMMON WAY IN WHICH GUN BY ITS CAN ESCALATE VERY QUICKLY IN IN IT COMES UP IN A LOT OF THE DATA. THAT I'VE SEEN AND THEN FINALLY RELATED TO INTERPERSONAL CONFLICT WE HAVE INCIDENTS -- THAT ARE NOT INTERPERSONAL OR NOT DOMESTIC -- AND THEY'RE JUST A RESULT OF PERSONAL BEEF SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MOST COMMON -- MOTIVATIONS. FOR GUN VIOLENCE AND NOW LET ME JUST. GIVE A COUPLE OF THE SUMMARY HERE ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND WE'LL GO TO THE OTHER PANELISTS OKAY -- IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXAMINE GUNS AND BUY IT SEPARATELY FROM GUN VIOLENCE -- AGAIN JUST TO KIND OF REITERATE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE MOTIVATIONS AND ACCESS GUNS -- IN IT'S CRUCIAL TO ADDRESS AMERICA'S CULTURAL LINES. BY DEALING WITH THINGS LIKE A MENTAL HEALTH POVERTY GANG PREVENTION AND AGAIN WE CAN IGNORE THE PORTS OF COMMUNITY RELATIONS PLEASE COMMITTEE RELATIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S A DOCTOR MARTINEZ THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS VERY THOROUGH IN A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION. SO I WANT TO GO TO THE REST OF PANEL -- MISTER BOND -- YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIVE SAN -- AS I MENTIONED MY NAME IS SAM VINE SERVICE THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF RICHMOND'S OFFICE NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY -- THE ALSO NEIGHBORS SAFETY IS A NON LAW ENFORCEMENT GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY WHOSE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO REDUCE A ONE DAY ELIMINATE GUN VIOLENCE IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND -- I WAS EX TO BRING. PERSONAL STORIES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE TO GIVE THIS -- SOME INSIGHT -- SO BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE OFFICE IN THE ROLE I PLAY I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF. I GREW UP IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS THE MAJORITY OF MY LIFE I LIKE MANY OF THE YOUNG MAN I CAME FROM A BROKEN HOME. THAT WAS EXPOSED TO POVERTY VIOLENCE DRUG ABUSE DRUG SALES. AT A VERY YOUNG AGE. AND LIKE MOST A YOUNG MAN GROWING UP IN THOSE CONDITIONS WHAT WAS ASSN WAS A HEALTHY MALE. HELPING ME GET THROUGH THE CONFUSION THAT THAT ENVIRONMENT BRINGS. SO I GREW UP ANGRY. BITTER AND FELL INTO THE SAME TRAPS THAT ARE OUT THERE WAITING FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE STEP IN TODAY. I GREW UP DEPRESSED. ISOLATED AND FULL OF RAGING CONTENT. AND BECAUSE OF MY ADOLESCENT MIND EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE SHOWED ME THAT NO ONE CARED ABOUT ME AND MY OBLIGATION WAS TO FEND FOR MYSELF. IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING OR AT LEAST BELIEVE IN THIS I BECAME VERY SELFISH. I BELIEVE NO ONE CARED ABOUT ME SO WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT ANYONE ELSE. AND I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO BE. IN BREACH LONELINESS NO SENSE OF BELONGING AND SECURITIES AND LOW SELF ESTEEM. IT LITERALL CREATE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND TENDENCIES. AND THEY'RE VERY CLEAR BY THE WAY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LIVING THEIR LIFE LIKE THEY ARE NOT PLANNING FOR FUTURE. IN A PUT IT PLAINLY -- LITTLE WING SAYS IT THE BEST. WAS THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF SOMEONE WHO HAS NO EXPECTATIONS. THIS IS THE STATE OF MOST URBAN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND AS I'M SURE YOU ARE ALL AWARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF STATE SANCTIONED VIOLENCE LONG BEFORE THE INCEPTION OF THIS COUNTRY. IT IS COME IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS FROM SLAVERY. TO JIM CROW FROM EUGENICS TO REDLINING FOR MORE ON DRUGS TO UNDER FUNNY MINORITY SCHOOLS. TO GERRYMANDERING ENGINES FOR CASE. AND HOPEFULLY YOU WILL HAVE OTHER SENATE COMMITTEES. HEARINGS ON THOSE THINGS -- BECAUSE OF WHAT IT IS DONE IS DAMAGE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND TO BE CLEAR ALL OF THESE AND MUCH MORE PLAYED A VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE STATE OF URBAN COMMUNITIES. AND SADLY MOST OF THE VICTIMS OF THESE GOVERNMENT POLICIES AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. ALL THEY'RE AWARE OF HIS THIS IS CUMULATIVE A COMMUNITY. CAN YOU. CUMULATIVE EFFECTS SKEWS ME. IT IS NOW BEEN DEEMED BY MAINSTREAM SOCIETY IT IS A CRIME TO BE A PERSON OF COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS THE STATE OF OUR NATION. I BELIEVE THIS GROWING UP IN NOT ONLY ACCEPTED IT AS FACT BUT THROUGH MY IGNORANCE I LIVED UP TO IT. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AS A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD I WAS ARRESTED TRIED AND CONVICTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER. FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS I WAS INCARCERATED AND LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MYSELF. WHAT I LEARNED EVEN MORE ABOUT THE SOCIETY THAT WAS BEING PROTECTED FOR ME? I SPENT MY YEARS DOING ANY SELF HELP GROUP THAT HAS SPACE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FORMS I GOT A COLLEGE DEGREE I BEGIN MENTORING YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE VERGE OF MAKING SIMILAR MISTAKES TO MY OWN. AND UNBEKNOWNST TO ME ALL OF THIS WAS PREPARE ME FOR WHAT WAS IN STORE UPON MY RELEASE. SO TO GET BACK TO MY ROLE AT THE OFFICE. NINE MONTHS AFTER MY RELEASE I STARTED AS A PART TIME PEACEKEEPER WITH THE AN S.. AND BEGAN THIS JOURNEY THAT I'M ON TODAY. AS I MENTIONED THE ONUS IS NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR WHOLE RESPONSIBILITIES TO REDUCE AND ONE DAY ELIMINATE GUN VIOLENCE IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND. AT THE DEPARTMENT WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AFTER COMMUNITY OUTCRY -- HISTORICALLY THE CITY HAS DEALT WITH WITH GUN VIOLENCE ISSUES FOR DECADES WE'VE BEEN ON THE TOP TEN MOST DANGEROUS CITIES. LIST AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. AND FOR THE TWENTY YEARS PRIOR TO THE OFFICES CREATION WE AVERAGED OVER THIRTY SEVEN HOMICIDES PER YEAR BY FIREARMS. IN THAT IS WITH THE CITY POPULATION UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ON THE CITY LEADERSHIP DECIDED. TO CREATE THIS FIRST OF ITS KIND OFFICE WITHIN CITY GOVERNMENT THREE DO STUDENTS RELATED INJURIES OR DEATH -- STREET OUTREACH TEAM WAS DEPLOYED IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND WHAT IS CALLED THE IRON TRIANGLE WITHIN OUR CITY -- BECAUSE THE YEAR PRIOR TO THAT THE IRON TRIANGLE HAD A TWENTY SIX OF THE FORTY THREE SHOOTING HOMICIDES IN THAT CITY -- SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ALL OF OUR ENERGY WAS DEPLOYED TO THAT AREA AND IS SEEN THREE SHOOTING DEATHS IN TWO THOUSAND AND THE CITY LOOK AT IT IS SUCCESS SPREAD THE FOR OUTREACH WORKERS TO THE WHOLE CD AND LOW BEHOLD. WE ENDED UP RIGHT WHERE WE STARTED.% SO IN THIS LEADERSHIP REALIZED THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK. AND DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY TO MAXIMIZE OUR IMPACT WITH LIMITED RESOURCES -- DURING THAT TIME WE ALSO REALIZE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE IMPACTED IN THESE COMMUNITIES BY GUN VIOLENCE IS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEM WHO ARE ACTUALLY CREATING THE STATISTICS -- IN THE COMMUNITY. SO IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND TEN WE TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND WE CREATED WHAT WE CALL THE OPERATION PEACEMAKER FELLOWSHIP. THE FELLOWSHIP IS A NON MANDATED INTENSIVE MENTORING INTERVENTION DESIGNED FOR YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AS BEING AT THE CENTER OF AND MOST IMPACTED BY GUN VIOLENCE IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND. THE LAST MINIMUM OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND CONSIST OF SEVENTY COMPONENTS. DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FILLS WITH TOOL SKILLS AND RESOURCES TO LEAD HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO TRUST US ENOUGH TO PARTNER WITH US ON THIS JOURNEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL WITH DAILY CONTACTS. WE WILL CONTINUOUSLY PROVIDE HEALTH INFORMATION AND THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN HAVE A PRODUCTIVE FUTURE. THEY CAN PLAN FOR THEIR FUTURE AND GET CASTING HELP FEEDBACK AND PRODDING AS WELL SERVICE NAVIGATION TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS -- WE BELIEVE THAT EXPERIENCES PLACES THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW EXIST. HELP CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL NORMS TO BE ABLE TO GET OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU MAY NOT OF NO INTEREST YOU. CAN GIVE YOU A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. AND TO BE EXPOSED IN INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION TO OUR ELDERS CIRCLE. IN IN BEING REWARDED FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION TO YOUR PERSONAL PROCESS CAN CREATE HOLE IN WHAT SOME WOULD CONSIDER A HOPELESS SITUATION. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE PUT. THE ONUS HAS LIMITED RESOURCES SO IN ORDER TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OUR FELLOWS MUST BE SELECTED WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION. OF THE NCAA'S PUBLIC SAFETY ORGANIZATION CBO'S AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE KEY TO PROVIDING INFORMATION TO HELP WITH THIS SELECTION PROCESS. THE ONUS HAS A LASER FOCUS WHEN DECIDING WHOM TO ENGAGE FOR THE FELLOWSHIP AND ONE DONE RIGHT CITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND COUNTRY CAN CREATE THE RESULTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN AND REYES. WE STARTED THIS PROCESS IN TWO THOUSAND TEEN. AND WE HAVE COMPLETED FIVE COAL WORDS SINCE THE OF THOSE FIVE COURSE WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED AND SIX FELLOWS. 96% OF THOSE FELLOWS ARE STILL ALIVE. 80% OF THOSE FELLOWS HAD NOT BEEN INJURED BY FIREARMS IS BECOMING A FELLOW. AND 70% OF THOSE FELLOWS HAVE NOT BEEN SUSPECTED OF A FIREARM RELATED CRIME SINCE BECOMING A FELLOW. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROCESS HAS ALLOWED YOUNG MAN IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND TO BEGIN QUESTIONING. HOW THE OF NORMALLY DEALT WITH THEIR CONFLICT AND GIVEN THEM COURAGE TO CHALLENGE THAT AND DEAL WITH IT IN A MORE HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE WAY? WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THESE YOUNG MAN'S BETTER DECISION MAKING HAS BEEN A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE MASS OF DECLINING SHOOTINGS IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND. IN SKEWS ME LAST YEAR -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE RECORDED THE LOWEST AMOUNT OF SHOOTINGS LEADING TO INJURY OR DEATH IN OVER FORTY YEARS. RECORDING A 73% REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE YEAR OFFICE OPENED. CAN I WANT TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE. THAT'S TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T GET SHOT IN OUR COMMUNITY LAST YEAR COMPARED. TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THIS IS A PROCESS THAT CAN HELP COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE HELP REDUCE THEIR GUN VIOLENCE ISSUES. SACRAMENTO IS WELL STOCKED AND HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED THIS PROCESS IN OUR THEIR PATH TO THE SUCCESS -- THE ONLY PROBLEM IS TO CREATE THE POLITICAL WILL. TO TREAT THESE YOUNG MAN HIS ASSETS AND VIABLE PARTNERS IN THIS ENDEAVOR INSTEAD OF THE ANIMALS THAT HAVE CREATED THE RISK. THAT ALL OF US ARE DEALING WITH. AND I SAY THIS [inaudible] EXCUSE ME. ANDI SAY THIS BECAUSE THERE'S MANY THERE'S BEEN MANY SPEAKERS THAT HAVE THAT HAVE COME UP AND SO I ALWAYS -- BRING THIS TO LIGHT. LAST YEAR THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS KILLED OVER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUE SHE HAD AN ABUSER IT WAS STALKING HER. AND HE CAUGHT HER ON THE WAY TO DROP HER TWO CHILDREN OFFICE SCHOOL -- KILLING HER IN FRONT OF THOSE TWO CHILDREN. IN THE FIRST THING THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT. WAS IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET A HOLD OF THOSE TWO CHILDREN. RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AT THEM AS VICTIMS AND GIVE PT IN SORROW FOR THEM. BUT IN FIFTEEN YEARS IF IT HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED IN THEIR RESPONDING IN THIS WAY THEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE ANIMALS CRIMINALS TO DESERVE PUNISHMENT AND INCARCERATIONS. SO THAT IS A FAILURE ON THE COMMUNITY. RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEN THESE THESE DETAINMENT CAMPS AND A. O. C. BECAUSE IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS. WITH THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN BEING MISTREATED -- DONALD TRUMP HIS HIS ARGUED THAT THESE ARE IN MISTER TEEN DRUG DEALERS RAPISTS KILLERS THEY'RE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND HE HAS TO PROTECT US FROM THEM. IF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DEALT WITH CORRECTLY THEY WILL TURN INTO EXACTLY WHAT HE'S ACCUSING THEM OF IN AND WHAT HE'S GOING TO BE SAYING TO SEE I TOLD YOU SO. BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS THEY ARE CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR THESE THINGS TO TAKE PLACE. BUT IT'S ALSO A SHAME ON US MOMENT -- OUR OUR APPROACH IS WHAT IS CONSIDERED A CRIME INFORMED IN TRAUMA RESPONSE OF APPROACH. ANY WORKABLE WILL CONTINUE TO STAY BUSY IF WE ARE TREATING THE YOUTH IN THESE COMMUNITIES LIKE THERE ARE FUTURE. AND NOT THE FUTURE TO KEEP LAW ENFORCEMENT INCARCERATION BUDGETS THE STATUS QUO. BUT FUTURE SCIENTISTS INVENT INVENTORS ENGINEERS UTILITY WORKERS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. WE HAVE TO TREAT OUR OUR CHILDREN HUMANELY THROUGH LOVE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO GIVE THEM BLANK IS FULL OF SMALLPOX IN THE IN THE QUEUES THEM AND BLAME THEM AND PUNISH THEM. FOR GETTING SICK. AND SO WE HAVE TO DO BETTER THIS IS A THIS IS A SOCIETAL ISSUE. IS NOT A A CRIME AND PUNISHMENT ISSUE WE CAN WE CAN CREATE POLICIES WE CAN CREATED MAKE IT HARDER TO GET GUNS. BUT IF WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SOCIAL NORMS OF FOR NOT CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THESE COMMUNITIES -- WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO HELP THEM CHANGE THEIR VALUE SYSTEM WHICH MEANS WE HAVE. TO ALLOW WOULD SEE THEM TO BE VALUABLE AND VALUE THEIR INPUT AND MAKE THEM A PART OF THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER VON MISTER GREEN. HEY ARE YOU GOING. HOME. WELL. TODAY -- FIVE HOURS AGO -- THERE WAS A FUNERAL. OF A YOUNG MAN A TO YOUR YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME JOSE RIVERA WAS KILLED. ON JUNE SIXTEENTH. AND THAT WAS FATHER'S DAY. SO THE MAGIC OF FATHER GETTING THE NEWS ON FATHER'S DAY THAT HIS SON WAS JUST KILLED FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. NO MATTER WHAT IS SOME WAS DOING A MATTER WHAT HE WAS INTO. THAT'S DEVASTATING NEWS -- YOU KNOW IN A COUPLE IN A IN WITHIN A WEEK WE'RE GOING TO BE -- BEARING ANOTHER YOUNG MAN. AUDIBLE STOP COMING FROM HIS GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE. CAUGHT UP AND GUN CHARGES THIS IS ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON. ON A THURSDAY -- HEARD THAT A LOT OF THE DATA THAT MISSED ALL PROFESSOR MARTINEZ WAS SPOKEN ABOUT -- JUST A HARBOR DIVISION. FROM MAY TWENTY SIX TWO JUNE TWENTY SECOND. THOSE POOR HOMICIDES. IN A FOUR WEEK SPAN. NINE SHOOTING VICTIMS. OKAY. BUT THERE'S A THIRD NUMBER THAT PEOPLE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT. SHOTS FIRED. YOU KNOW THAT VERY WELL YOU'VE BEEN A POLICE OFFICER. SHOTS FIRED IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE. UNREPORTED BECAUSE BEING MORE COMMON IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT THOSE COULD BE POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF HOMICIDE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY KILLED OR NOT. SO THIS GUN VIOLENCE IS IS WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE WHOLE THING ON OF THE POTENTIALS. ON EIGHTEEN MURDERS [inaudible] AND TWO YEARS JUST IN THE CITY OF WILMINGTON. YOU KNOW. THAT'S A LOT. OF THOSE TWO ONE HAPPEN ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE I LIVE. WHAT HAPPENED I HAVE A BLOCK DOWN FROM WHERE I LIVE? I LIVE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE EATEN. OR IT'S VERY. LOT OF GANG SO FOR YOU KNOW THIS BETTER THAN THAN I DO. YOU KNOW YOU GREW UP IN A IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT -- TO CUT A LOT OF VIOLENCE -- THEN YOU PROBABLY HAVE FRIENDS. THAT USED HER DIED GO TO JAIL WHATEVER NOW I'M DEALING WITH MY FRIENDS. KIDS AND THEIR GRANDKIDS. YOU KNOW SO THIS IS A A CYCLE THAT SAW -- KEEP GOING NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S. DOING HIGH FIVES BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING THAT VIOLENCE IS GOING DOWN. HOMICIDES GONE DOWN. BUT IT'S STILL THERE -- IN A COUPLE YEARS AGO I HAD TWO FRIENDS I GREW UP WITH. VERY CLOSE TO THEM. AND THE TWO GUYS WERE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. WELL ONE OF THE SONS KILLED THE OTHER SON [inaudible] JUST IMAGINE. TWO GUYS GROWN UP. AND THERE'S ONE OF THOSE ONE OF THEIR SONS KILLED HIS OFF FRIENDS SIDE. I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. YOU KNOW. GOING TO A FUNERAL ONE GOING TO COURT FOR THE OTHER. THOSE FAMILIES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. ARE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU WANT TO RAISE UP IN HERE IS TRAUMA. YOU KNOW SERVICE TRAUMA. WHEN YOU HAVE A? KILLING ON THE STREETS WHEN USUALLY HAPPENS CAR WASH RIGHT. TO RAISE MONEY. THEN THEY HAVE THE CANDLES INDIVIDUALS. WITH THE PERSON YOU KNOW GOT KILLED. HOW MUCH TRAUMA DO YOU CALLS THAT COMMUNITY? WHEN SOMEBODY DIED ON THEIR BLOCK? THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. AND WHEN YOU GO TO WORKING YOU KIDS GO TO SCHOOL THEY SEE CANDLES OUT THERE AND PICTURES OF SOMEBODY JUST GOT KILLED ESTHER MATIC. SO YOU JUST KEEP THAT TRAUMA GOING IN WITH FULL SAID DOES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT MURDER. IT IT HURTS EVERYBODY EVERYBODY -- YOUR COLLEAGUE JIM COOPER SPOKE ABOUT HEALING INSTITUTIONS. I THINK HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ARE FRAGMENTED INSTITUTIONS. WHERE OUR FAMILY? OUR CHURCHES ARE COMMUNITIES. AND IN MOST SENSES ARE FAMILIES HAVE LET DOWN OUR KIDS. THOSE ARE FRAGMENTED INSTITUTIONS. WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO HEAL THEM. WE REALLY NEED TO FIND A WAY HOW TO HEAL THEM. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW. I LISTEN TO THIS YOUNG MAN. TWICE YOU KNOW ABOUT -- GUNS ACCESS TO GUNS. LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES IN YOUR WEIGHT WHERE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR ARM ARE VERY POOR. THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS ON HOW MUCH FOOD THEY PUT ON THE TABLE. HOW MUCH GAS THEY PUT THE CARD TO PAY THE REST OF THE BILLS? HOW CAN A FAMILY LIVE LIKE THAT BUT A KID IN THAT FAMILY CAN GET ACCESS TO A GUN? WHETHER IT'S HANDED DOWN TO HIM OR THE HOUSES OF TWO THREE FOUR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET A GUN. IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS. HOW ARE THESE GUYS GET INTO THE HANDS OF OUR KIDS? AND AS I'VE I'VE BEEN WHERE I WAS AT FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. IN IN THE BEGINNING -- HOUSE A FIREFIGHTER. JUST GOING TO ONE INCIDENTS AFTER ANOTHER YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT. BE ENOUGH -- BY THIS BY CENTER UP THERE. SO WE'RE DOING. GOING TO ONE INCIDENT PUT IT OUT MEDIATING BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH. BUT THAT'S ALL WE WERE FOR THAT'S ALL I WAS FOR AWHILE TO MY KIND OF STARTED FIGURING OUT THINGS [inaudible] IN ALL. BEING REACTIVE. IT'S NOT HAPPENING -- WE HAVE TO BE IN A STATE WHERE WERE MORE PROACTIVE. I HAD TO LEARN YOU KNOW I THERE'S A CITY ATTORNEY YOU MIGHT NOR EVE SHADY. SHE'S A CITY ATTORNEY THAT WAS WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. AND SHE BASICALLY RUNS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. YOU KNOW SHE OVERSEEING THAT. I HAD TO LEARN A LOT FROM HER ABOUT THE V.. NOT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMPONENT YES. BUT ABOUT VIOLENCE IN THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AND HOW KIDS GROW UP IN A HOME THAT THERE'S VIOLENCE AND THEY DON'T GROW OUT OF IT. AND WE WERE RAISING ANGRY KIDS. LEARNING ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS YOU KNOW. UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW OF AND I NOTICED THROUGH THE TV THING. OR WHAT OUR FRONTAL LOBES THE LAST PART OF OUR BRING TO DEVELOP. THAT'S A PART OF THE BRAIN THAT. DEALS WITH LOGICAL REASONING. SO THEN WE ASK YOU KNOW WHY ARE YOU MAKING. THESE DECISIONS BECAUSE THEIR BRAIN HAS A FULLY DEVELOPED. IN A PART OF REASONING MAKE IT LOGIC. WHAT I'M GETTING TO WHEN I SAY THAT YOU KNOW LEARNING ABOUT TRAUMA? WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT WAS THE? THE THE THE KIDS A SENIOR MOMENT DIE. OR GET KILLED RIGHT. FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE UNRESOLVED TRAUMA A RESOLVE ISSUES THAT THAT ISN'T DEALT WITH. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. INTERVENTION WORKERS WERE OUT THERE DO ADVICE INTERRUPTIONS. WE CAN BE FIREFIGHTERS ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THE TRAUMA SO WE COULD DEAL WITH THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THE V. WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT ALL THESE. MENTAL HEALTH. WE'RE IN COMMUNITIES THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS OF A STIGMA ALL THESE CRAZY HE'S THIS. NOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO WE HAVE TO RE EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITIES. ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT TO MIKE. IS THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN SILOS. EVERYBODY HAS A EVERY BATTER HAS A PART TO PLAY WHATEVER ISSUES US IN OUR COMMUNITY. GANG VIOLENCE IS A ISSUE THAT'S PLAYING A SPECIALLY IN SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE CHALLENGES. AND I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN SILOS IN YOUR STAFF DON'T I KNOW VICTOR CHRIS OF DIANA DENTAL BELIEVE IN SILOS EITHER. WE CAN'T CONTINUE WORKING THE SILOS. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. EVERYBODY HAS A PART TO PLAY. EVERYBODY HAS A PART TO PLAY. AND WATCHING YOU ALL THESE YEARS I KNOW YOU BELIEVE THAT AS WELL. YOU KNOW. IF YOU'RE NOT A VIOLENCE INTERRUPTERS YOU'RE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHATEVER PART YOU PLAY IN OUR SOCIETY YOU HAVE A PART TO PLAY WHAT'S GOING ON IN IN WHAT WERE MEETING ABOUT TODAY. EVERYBODY HAS A PART TO PLAY. YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT IS TO GET A GUN. TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO I WAS A FIREFIGHTER TODAY I'VE EVER LOOK AT MY EVOLUTION IS GROWING INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE BECAUSE WE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS ON THE FRONT END. WE CONTINUE DEALING WITH THE STUFF ON THE BACK AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GETTING IN ALL STUFF ON US. WE DON'T SAY THAT. I'VE WATCHED HOW. ARE VICTIMS. AND THE PERPETRATORS ARE GETTING YOUNGER. I GET A YOUNGER. YOU REMEMBER THE CASE WITH -- ALEX SEBADOH. WHAT DISCOUNTS FOR TEN FORTY OWES ACCUSED OF HIS MURDER? YOU KNOW WE JUST HAD THIS OTHER OF GUY JUST COPY THE FORTY YEARS OLD. HAD A COUPLE OF MULTI SHOOTINGS. SO WATCHING OUR KIDS GOING OUT THERE. NOT ONLY BE A VICTIMS. BUT BEING A PERPETRATORS. HOW DO WE LET OUR SOCIETY COME TO THAT? HOW DO WE DO THAT? SO AT THE END OF THE DAY. I'M ON YOUR TEAM WHEN YOU SET WE CAN'T WORK IN SILOS ANYMORE. EVERYBODY HAS A PART TO PLAY. TO GET THIS GUN ISSUE. IN HIS GUN VIOLENCE. WHERE YOU KNOW? IT SHOULD BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE. I KNOW YOU WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ONE DAY OF VIOLENCE FREE. YOU KNOW I'M SAYING. WE NEED TO BRING BACK MORE DONE BY BACKS. THE YOU KNOW WE HAD ONE IN THE HARBOR [inaudible] WE SOURCES. KIND OF STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING A MORE. GETTING GUNS OFF THE STREETS. YOU KNOW BECAUSE SOME OF THE GUYS YOU TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST GUNS THAT JUST FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS. SO WE NEED A LOT MORE INNOVATIVE. WAYS OF FIRST OF ALL GETTING OF THOSE GUNS OFF THE STREETS. BUT RE EDUCATING OUR KIDS PUTTING MORE INVEST INVESTING IN OUR KIDS DIFFERENTLY. SEAN WHAT A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE BE A MORE SUPPORTIVE GIVING MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS OUT THERE GETTING MORE VIOLENCE INTERRUPTERS A MORE. MENTORS AND BIG BROTHER PROGRAMS. WITH. MENTORS ENBERG BROTHERS OF THE KIDS THAT LOOK LIKE THEM. THAT CAME FROM THE SAME CLOTH. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE ALL. THE ALL HAVE A PART TO PLAY THIS GUN VIOLENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS GREEN FOR YOUR COMMENTS I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I WANT TO ASK THE THE COMMITTEE OF THE PANEL A QUESTION. HOW DO WE GET THE -- JEEZ INVOLVE -- BECAUSE THOSE THE ONES THAT THE LITTLE WAS A LOOKING UP TO AND WE STILL TALK ABOUT GANG VIOLENCE -- WITH GUNS HOW DO WE GET THE JEEZ INVOLVED INTO HELPING -- NOT ONLY SUPPRESS BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE -- TALKING TO THE YOUNG ONES WHO'S COMING UP WAS WATCHING THEM WHETHER YOU SPENT SOME TIME IN PRISON AND NOW YOU'RE OUT. BUT HOW DO WE GET THOSE INDIVIDUALS -- INVOLVED IN THIS WORK AND NOT WORKING IN SILOS BUT ALSO WORKING AS COMMUNITIES TRY TO ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE LISTEN I'M TIRED OF GOING TO FUNERALS. I'M TIRED OF MOTHERS CRYING OVER LIFELESS BODIES -- AND FATHERS WHO FEEL THAT THEIR POWERS BECAUSE OUR SON BECAUSE THE FATHERS OUT THERE TRYING TO WORK TO MAKE ENDS MEET BUT AS HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO SPEND WITH HIS SON AND HIS SON IS GET INVOLVED IN GANGS AND DRUGS. THE END UP HIM LOSING HIS LIFE -- BECAUSE OF ON THE STREETS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO INVITE THEM INTO A GANG SO HOW DO WE GET. EITHER -- JEEZ -- INVOLVED IN THIS WORK THAT WE'RE DOING -- AS WELL AS YOU KNOW REALLY BE ABLE TO OF TEAR DOWN SOME WALLS -- FATHER BOYLE SAID THIS OF HOMEBOYS WAKE BAKERY GIVE A MAN A WOMAN A JOB STOP A BULLET. GIVE ME A JOB. STOP A BULLET AND IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT EVERYONE WHO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TAKEN SOMEONE'S LIFE AND ASK THEM WHERE DO YOU WORK. I BET THE ANSWER IS I DON'T WORK. AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY. THEY'RE DOING THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID I DON'T MIND IS IS IS THE DEVIL'S WORKSHOP. SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. IS THE VALUE OF HER YEAH WILL FIRST AT AT I WOULDN'T ACTUALLY COMPLETELY AGREE WITH OKAY. JOB AND TAKE AWAY A BULLET I ME YOU'RE RIGHT MOST FOLKS WHO SHOOTING ARE WORKING BUT THEY WOULD WORK. BUT THEY COME HOME AND STILL DO WHAT THEY DO IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT I'M JUST BORED IS ABOUT THERE'S A REAL -- THERE'S A REAL CONFLICT IN A REAL HATRED THE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- YOU A JOB NOT A CAN AFFORD MORE WEAPONS POSSIBLY -- SO DEEP BUT DO YOU SEE THAT THERE ARE MANY NOT YOU KNOW I I I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN SHOT AT THEIR JOB. THEY'RE AT WORK I GOT A JOB IN A STILL SMOKING AND THEY SAW ME WORKING SO ME LEAVING FROM WORK. AND SO NOW NEXT WEEK YOU FIND FIRED AND I HE'LL WHEN I GET OFF WORK BECAUSE I NEED MY JOB TO PAY MY RENT. BUT I'M STILL GETTING BACK AT IT SO IT'S IT'S IT'S THE MIND SAID NOT JUST THE EMPLOYMENT YES POVERTY -- DEPRESSION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE PLAYED A ROLE -- BUT A JOB ISN'T GONNA STOP A BULLET YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE MY SAID BUYBACKS IS GONNA STOP A BULLET. THE HARSHER GOING LOSS ISN'T GONNA STOP A BULLET UNTIL YOU GET TO A PLACE WHERE I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT ANYONE. BECAUSE I HAVE A VALUE A LIFE AND I VALUE MYSELF IN A VALUE OTHERS WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE SOCIAL NORMS IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT'S GOING THINGS GONNA STOP A BULLET FOR MY OPINION. YOU ONE OH JEEZ TO GET INVOLVED GIVER TO GETTING ANSWERS. BECAUSE I'M NOT HELPING BECAUSE I HAVE A FAMILY I'M A TWO STRIKER I DON'T WANT THESE YOUNGSTERS TO KILL EACH OTHER BUT I GET INVOLVED. I HAVE THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY I HOLD THAT KIND OF RESPECT I MUST BE LEADER THAT GAY AND I GOT A RICO ACT. GOT YOU STUCK MORE TEARS RATE YOU RAISE A POINT WHEN YOU GAVE IT YOUR DIAGRAM -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I MEAN YOU KNOW MOST OF MY WORK THE ANYWAY -- BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE NO FEDERAL GUN LAWS INTERVENING CALIFORNIA CONTINUES LEAD THE WAY WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO GUN CONTROL AND YOU DEMONSTRATE THROUGH YOUR ANALYSIS TO SHOW THAT YOU KNOW GUNS COMING FROM ARIZONA. COMING IN FROM THE BATTER INTO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR GUN LAWS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET HIM HERE AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO THE INTERNET. OR THE GOING THROUGH THE THE THREE D. PRINTER AND MAKING A WE CALLED GOALS GUNS HAVE A BILL A A. B. -- EIGHT SEVENTY NINE TO HOPEFULLY ADDRESS -- THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE WE SEE IT. A HUSBAND WIFE WAS MANUFACTURING GOES GUNS MY IN MY DISTRICT AND BOTH OF THOSE ARRESTED OF OPEN PLED GUILTY BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER GERMAN WHO WAS MAKING GHOST GUNS. WHO PLED NOT GUILTY WHO WAS SELLING GUNS THE CRIPS AND BLOODS? SO THROUGH THROUGH THAT I JUST WANT TO RESPOND THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN BUT A LESSON OF A NERVE THAT NEVADA OR ARIZONA HAVE STRICT DRUNK YOU KNOW GUN LAWS. THEY WILL STILL HAVE THE PROLIFERATION OF THAT COMING INTO CALIFORNIA BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO ACT IN THIS SPACE YOUR COMMENTS YEAH. THAT'S A SEVERE LIMITATION OF OFFERS ON THE BACK TO YOUR POINT TO THE THE THE NORMS ARE. PART OF WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY TO THE MOTIVATION. TO HAVE THE GUN RIGHT IF YOU HAVE IF YOU'RE BROKEN PERSON YOU'RE ANGRY LIKE YOU SAID RIGHT. THAT'S THAT'S A FACTOR SO THEN THE ACCESS PART. IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT TO BE. AND SO DESPITE THE FEDERAL LIMITATIONS RIGHT OF NOT HAVING. A UNIVERSAL -- STANDARDIZE -- STRICT SET OF LAWS IN PLACE WHAT WE CAN DO WE HAVE TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO. AND I REALLY THINK THAT HAVING A DATABASE. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND AT THE STATE LEVEL. WHAT AT LEAST ALLOW US TO HAVE BETTER DATA? TO GO AFTER THESE DEALERS IN PLACES LIKE NEVADA. OR ARIZONA BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE THAT'S A FEDERAL CRIME TRAFFICKING GUNS. OVER STATE LINES RIGHT. AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE TO START. DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THERE'S A HOMICIDE THESE DETECTIVES. DATE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT THEY WANT TO DO THIS WHAT THEY'LL LONG FOR SIZE TALK TO ME. IS -- GETTING THE GUN. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY PROSECUTE ANYONE IN A COURT OF LAW RIGHT SO THEY GET THE GUN. AND THEN THEY WANT TO FIND OUT. WHOSE GUN IS IT WHERE DID THE GUN. COME FROM HOW DID END UP IN YOUR HAND SO THAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED. WHEN THEY DO GET THE GUN AND BY THE WAY LAW ENFORCEMENT TOLD ME THEY ONLY GET THE GUNS IN HOMICIDES ABOUT 40% OF THE TIME MAYBE THIRTIES THEY DON'T ALWAYS GET HIM? BUT IF THEY KEPT BETTER DATA AT THE STATE REQUIRED THEM TO KEEP BETTER DATA AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND IF THE STATE MAINTAINED A BETTER DATABASE OF THESE GUNS AND WERE ABLE. TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH OTHER CITIES. THAT WOULD EMPOWER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO PROSECUTE THE STATE'S AND BRING THE ISSUE. ELEVATE THE ISSUE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE TECHNICALLY A FEDERAL CRIME. SO THERE IS THAT SO THAT WAS THE FIRST ANSWER THE GHOST GUNS -- THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOUR BILL BECAUSE THERE ARE NO SERIAL NUMBERS I GUESS SO THEN THE ISSUE WOULD BE THE THREE D. PRINTER BUT ALL ALL ALL ALL I WANNA LEARN FROM YOU ON THAT BUT THAT'S MY ANSWER TO THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU REVISED YOU KNOW EVERY TIME MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT THE ACROSS THE AISLE -- AND DOES NOT. A LET IT -- THEY HAVE ALWAYS PUSHED BACK AND THEY SAID. PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE GUNS DOESN'T KILL PEOPLE WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT. GO BACK TO MY DEFINITION OF GUN VIOLENCE AT THE BEGINNING RIGHT. VIOLENCE THE PROPENSITY THE VIOLENCE IS WHAT DRIVES -- GUN VIOLENCE RIGHT THAT'S THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE VIOLENCE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS VIOLENCE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS VIOLENCE. IN SO WHAT GUNS DO IS THEY INTENSIFY THE VIOLENCE GO BACK TO MY THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUE YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S PREDISPOSED. TO COMMIT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST THEIR PARTNER IT'S GOING TO GET VIOLENT BE PUT A GUN IN THEIR HANDS. AND THEN DOUBTS WOULD THAT'S THE GAME CHANGER RIGHTS OF GUNS INTENSIFIED VIOLENCE. AND YOU NEED TO AND THAT'S HOW WE GET HIGHER HOMICIDE RATES THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT -- WITH POINT ONE TWO FINAL THOUGHTS REAL QUICK AND THEN WE WANT TO OPEN UP FOR ANYONE -- TO TO AN AUDIENCE TO HAVE AND ASK US ANY QUESTIONS OR MAKE COMMENTS SO -- FINAL THOUGHTS MISTER GREEN YEAH ON JUSTANSWER BACK ON THAT -- GTA. ALL. LIKE I SAID EVERYONE IN THIS SOCIETY HAS A ROLE EVEN THE JEEZ. BUT WE WE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE FOLKS TO COME IN AND AND HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUES WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE CREATE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WERE. ARE FOLKS THAT ARE COMING IN TO HELP OUR SUCCESSFUL. WE CAN'T TALK -- TO WITH WITH IN A GROUP SETTING. AND AND AND AND TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE THAT HAS TO GO BY INDIVIDUAL BY INDIVIDUAL. ON THE FATHER GREG BOYLE -- NOTHING STOPS A BULLET LIKE A LIKE A LIKE A JOB. HE GAVE ME A VERY COLORFUL STORY WHY HE IS NOT A 100%. I'LL TELL YOU THAT AFTER THIS MEETING. BOUGHT LIKE MISTER BOND SAID YOU GIVE A PERSON A JOB YOU STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT PERSON'S. ALL. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE PERSON HAS SOFT SKILLS YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT PERSON THE THE METAL IF HE HAS OR SHE HAS ANY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. OF SOCIAL SKILLS EVERYTHING ELSE HAVE TO BE IN PLACE. BECAUSE OF NOT WE WE HAVE WEEKEND WARRIORS WE HAVE GUYS THAT FALL BACK WE GRASS SLIP. SO IT'S A WHOLE BUT IT'S NOT JUST GIVING A PERSON A JOB AND YOU KNOW THERE GOES THE A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY TALE STORY. BUT I CAN'T. STRESS MORE THAT EVERYBODY HAS A PART TO PLAY IN THIS ISSUE THAT YOU BRING IT UP. THANK YOU DOCTOR MARTINS YOU HAVE ANY FINAL THOUGHTS. THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BOND. I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THEY WE GOT TO REALIZE THAT WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING INTO THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE DARK AND IN THE PROCESS OF GOING INTO THE DARKENED TRYING TO PARTNER WITH THESE FOLKS THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT. MAY NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO MAINSTREAM SOCIETY BUT WE'RE ASKING THEM NOT TO HARM ONE ANOTHER WE'RE ASKING THEM NOT TO BE WILLING TO KILL ONE ANOTHER SO CERTAIN THINGS ALTHOUGH MAY NOT BE LEGAL. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE CONSEQUENCES ON THEIR OWN. WE GOT IT WE HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE NOT ACCEPTED BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON IN THESE COMMUNITIES ARE THEIR REALITY. AND WE HAVE TO GO IN THERE AND ACCEPT THEM FOR WHO THEY ARE AND STILL AND BREAKS DOWN TO IT. TRY TO ENCOURAGE THEM THE DEAL IN WHICH A CONFLICT WITH A FIREARM SHOULD BE AN ACCEPTABLE. I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR ONE SECOND SOMEBODY BRIDGES SCHEDULING SHARE WITH US AT THIS HEARING WE APPRECIATE IT WE HAVE CAPTURED AS AS MUCH AS INFORMATION AS WE POSSIBLY COULD AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT. IS BEEN INVALUABLE AT THIS POINT TIME WE WANT TO OPEN THE UP PUBLIC HEARING. OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION -- SO PLEASE IF YOU -- BECAUSE STEP TO THE MICROPHONE AND PLEASE GIVE US YOUR NAME IF YOU WITH AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE SHARE THE ORGANIZATION AND PLEASE SHARE YOUR COMMENTS. WELL MISTER GIBSON -- AT THE ROLE THAT THE U. JUST COALITION IS ONE THANK YOU ALL WE CAMPAÃ±A HAD HAD -- HI. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS DO IT ALONE. YEAH. WILL THIS IN -- YET THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS COMMITTEE IN ADDRESSING THIS THIS ISSUE -- AND INCLUDING THE PART ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL THINK THESE ARE COULD COME CONVERSATION THAT NEEDTO BE HAD FOR A COMMUNITIES BUT YOU BACK ABOUT COMMUNITIES BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A A TOUGH ISSUE FOR US -- BUT FIRST OF ALL JUST LIKE START BY SAYING THAT GUN LAWS RESTRICTIVE GUN LAWS ARE INHERENTLY RACIST. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK BACK AT THE MALL FOR IT ACT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH WAS INTRODUCED -- AND PASS AND SUPPORTED BY RONALD REAGAN. AND THE NRA THAT BANNED OPEN CARRY IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY YEAH BAND OPEN K. FOR EVERYBODY BUT IT WAS SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE BLACK PANTHERS TO STORM THE CAPITOL WITH UNLOADED GUNS. ON AND YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW THE BLACK PANTHERS WERE WERE ARMED TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITIES FROM POLICE BRUTALITY. AND SO YOU PASSED FOR TODAY AND NOW THE NRA IS ALL ABOUT OPEN CARRY ON BUT THE SAME TIME DIDN'T SPEAK UP UPLAND OKAY STILL WAS KILLED WHO -- IF YOU KNOW FERNANDO COULD STILL STORY ON THEN ALRIGHT AND SPEAK UP FOR HIM TO KIND OF SHOW THE RACISM. OF A AND I THINK RESTRICTIVE GUN LAWS -- SOMEBODY SAID A PURELY RESTRICTIVE GUN LAWS ARE GONNA STOP COMBINE AND DAYS NEIGHBORING STATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THE BRING A MAN -- ALSO WITH THE RISE OF AUTHORITARIANISM THE RISE OF FASCISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. I'M VERY [inaudible] I'M VERY. CONCERNED ABOUT TAKING PEOPLE'S GUNS AWAY WHILE GOVERNMENT A GOVERNMENT TO BECOME A MORE AUTHORITARIAN -- SO AS CONCENTRATION CAMPS ARE BEING EXPOSED IN AMERICA OR TIME UP TAKING PEOPLE'S GUNS AWAY AND I DON'T KNOW IF ON IF THAT'S A SMART MOVE. BUT ANYWAYS I THINK FOR SOME SOLUTIONS -- TO COME BACK ON VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE FIRST THING I THINK WOULD BE TO END THE WARRING GANGS SO I MEANS ENDING GANG INJUNCTIONS ENDING GETTING ENHANCEMENTS ENDING GETTING DATABASES. ENDING GETTING -- REGISTRATION -- STOP CRIMINALIZING NEIGHBORHOODS OR OR WHAT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT STAKEHOLDER GANGS I'M IN RESOURCE THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WE COULD LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID IN ECUADOR -- THEY ACTUALLY ALLOWED TO GANGS TWO WERE JUST RECENTLY THEY ALLOWED GANGS TO REGISTER IS CULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE ALLERGY BULL TO APPLY FOR FUNDING. TO PROVIDE SOCIAL PROGRAMMING A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND I THINK IF WE COULD IF WE COULD ALLOW NEIGHBORHOODS TO DO THAT BECAUSE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GANGS ARE ASSOCIATION THE PEOPLE. WHO USUALLY COMPANY BUT WITHOUT RESOURCES THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH IS WHY THEY CONGREGATE TOGETHER AND AND GET INTO TO THESE OTHER ACTIVITIES -- TO ALSO NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF HEALING ON TODAY THERE IT DOES NEED TO BE A LOT OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE CIRCLES PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER -- WITH THE DEATH OF NIPSEY HUSSLE WE KNOW NOW LAY THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING TOGETHER TO TRY TO BRING PEACE TO HAVING PEACE TALKS IS HISTORIC HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE -- NINETEEN NINETY TWO NOTING FACILITATING A SUPPORTING MORE THAT IS THE CENTRAL AND THEN -- SUPPORTING YOU THINK COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT I'M A YOUTH DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT YOUTH CENTERS YOUTH EMPLOYMENT HIRING PEACE BUILDERS -- JEEZ FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON THAT ARE CONNECTED WITH COPS BECAUSE AND PEACE BUILDERS AGAIN INTERVENTION THIS ARE CONNECTED TO POLICE THEY LOSE THEIR CREDIBILITY WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THEM SO WE NEED. PEOPLE THE THE INDEPENDENT OF THE SYSTEM INDEPENDENT OF OF GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND AND POLICE WHAT THEY NEED TO BE RESOURCE -- ALSO MENTAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE SOMEBODY POINTED OUT -- AND YEAH AND THEN ALSO FOR THE FOR THE GUN VIOLENCE BETWEEN POLICE AND OUR COMMUNITIES -- SUPPORTING AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ARM AT A TO IMPLEMENT HOPEFULLY WHICH WILL BE THE NEW USE OF FORCE STANDARD IF AB THREE NINE TWO PASSES ON AND THEN STRENGTH IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE SO. WE CAN EXPOSE POLICE WHO ENGAGE IN THIS KIND OF MISCONDUCT -- BUT YEAH I'D REALLY HIGHLIGHT SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT SPECIAL PROSECUTOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AFTER IF YOU CAN PLEASE OF SHARE WITH YOU WERE READING OFF OF THEM SURE YOU YOU WROTE THAT WITH OUR TEAM EMAIL THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAPTURE ALL THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT. A GOOD AFTERNOON WHEN I STATUS IS VERY REAL WITH ME BY SALINAS ALSO REPRESENTED SEE YCJA CALIFORNIA LAST FOR YOU THANK IMMUNITY JUSTICE. I MEAN I WAS TOLD I ONE TIME THEY DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS IS INSANITY I WAS TOLD THAT FOR A LONG TIME. BECAUSE I WAS DO UP TO NO GOOD FOR A LONG TIME -- I'VE ALSO DONE ALMOST EIGHTEEN OUT OF FORTY ONE YEARS INCARCERATED I KNOW THE SYSTEM VERY VERY VERY WELL -- I NO PART OF THAT SYSTEM EVER HELP ME. AND THEN HEAR THE WORD TRAUMATIZED STARTED WORKING AT ME BY. THIS TIME OUT SO THAT MEANS THERE WAS NEVER A QUESTION IT WAS NEVER ADDRESSED. OUR SYSTEM OVERALL IS A FAILED SYSTEM IT'S A SYSTEM BASED ON KAPLAN IS MAKING A WHOLE CRAP LOAD OF MONEY OFF THE CARTER IN OUR FOLKS UP IN CARTER IN OUR KIDS. SO I THINK IT'S THE SAME FOR CONTINUE TO THE SAME THING AT THE WHEN YOU QUIT BSE. AND LET'S JUST HAVE SOME REAL TALK IS SAID WE GOT STIFF THE MATIC RACISM INGRAINED IN THE NUMEROUS SYSTEMS. THROUGHOUT THEIR POLICIES THAT IMPACT OUR PEOPLE OF COLOR VERY NEGATIVELY VERY ADVERSELY -- I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A TALK ABOUT A LEGISLATION TO OUR NORMAN 25% OF A CITY OR COUNTY BUDGET GOES TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. ON AVERAGE IS FIFTY OR MORE RIGHT OF THE BUDGETS MEANING THEY'RE CONSUMING ALL OF THE MONEY. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO PARKS IS NOT GOING TO REX IS NOT GOING TO NOTHING BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT I KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IN SALINAS IT'S OVER 50% -- THE MAJORITY OF OUR LAW FORCES ARE NOT LOCAL THEY DON'T GIVE A CRAP OF OUR COMMUNITY I COME FROM A PREDOMINANTLY LATINO COMMUNITY AND TWO YEARS AGO A FELLOW OFFICER TOLD ME. THAT THERE WAS SEVEN OFFICERS AND YOU SPANISH. RIGHT OUT OF THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT SO WE NEED CULTURALLY RELEVANT FOLKS WE NEED. LOCAL. OFFICERS WHO COME FROM OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE NEED GOOD OFFICERS NOT THERE'S THERE'S SOME GOOD ONES I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T MET TOO MANY GOOD ONES IN MY LIFE RIGHT SO MANY GOOD LOCAL OFFICERS -- AGAIN WE KNEW WE NEED THIS WE NEED TO LOOK AT THEIR BUDGETS AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S INSANE TO CONTINUE TO SPEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DAUGHTER NORTH SALINAS WE GOT. TO HUGE TAX I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER. FOUR WE SPEND THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A SHOT SPOTTER. THAT'S BODY SHOTS BUT ANY STOPPING NOTHING YOU KNOW -- AGAIN WE NEED INVESTMENT ROOT CAUSE ISSUES WHICH WITH ADDRESS TODAY AND POVERTY AND MENTAL HEALTH IN IN JOBS OPPORTUNITIES -- I THINK WHEN YOU CAN TO THE THE THE CURRENT PATH THAT WE'RE GOING IN BANNING THE BOX. ON A BUNCH OF OTHER GOOD LEGISLATION THAT'S MOVING INCLUDING POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. THREE TWO FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE SO ON AND SO BUT THE WHEN YOU'RE CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT LINE -- AND THEN ALSO WE'RE CURRENTLY CALL SPONSORING A. B. SIX FIVE SIX TWO TRYING TO CREATE A NEW OFFICE. OF HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON VIOLENCE PREVENTION. PEACEMAKING AND HEALING RIGHT -- WE'RE TRYING TO GET ALL DIFFERENT FORMS OF VIOLENCE ALL UNDER ONE ROOF BECAUSE AS IT STANDS THERE'S VERY LITTLE INVESTMENT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ARE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND BUT FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FORM OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE. RESOURCES WE HAVE. IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR BODY WAS IN OUR BLOOD SO IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT. WE'RE NOT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE PUBLIC AGENCY OR YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO QUITE FRANKLY -- WE DON'T REALLY SEE I DYED MY LOCAL COMMUNITY -- AND I COULD GO ON AND NOT BROUGHT THINK THAT'S THEIR RIGHT THERE AT THE GO AGAIN THIS NEW OFFICE OF HELPING SAVE COMMUNITIES IS A GOOD DIRECTION. I HOPE THAT WE MANAGE TO PASS THIS TO AGAIN. HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES OF ALL DIFFERENT FORMS OF VIOLENCE NOT JUST GOING BY THIS BUT DOMESTIC EITHER BE SO ON AND SO FORTH AND AND ALSO. VERY VERY IMPORTANT I LEARNED FROM MY EXPERIENCE IS A HEALING. ADDRESSING THAT TRAUMA THAT I TOOK AWAY FOR OVER TWO DECADES YOU KNOW. ADDRESSING THAT TRAUMA -- FOR US WE GO TO CEREMONY NO WE GO TO SWEAT LODGES OR TP SO OUR CULTURE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- SO CULTURALLY RELEVANT PROGRAMS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU THEIR CULTURAL IDENTITY YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS WITHOUT A WHOLE BUNCH ALIVE THEY TOLD ME COLUMBUS DISCOVERED AMERICA. BUT MY PRIMOS WORRY HERE RIGHT SO THEY TRY TO STRIP OUR IDENTITY. COLONIZATION SO WHEN YOU DE COLONIZE ALL THE WAY AROUND INCLUDING IN THIS BAD BOY RIGHT HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT. MY NAME IS ABRAHAM MEDINA I REPRESENT -- CALIFORNIA LINES. ON YOU FOR YOU THE COMMUNITY JUSTICE ALSO -- REPRESENT RECENTLY SO MUCH COUNTY I LIVE IN STOCKTON NOW BUT I GREW UP -- MOVING AROUND HOW FREQUENTLY IN SOMETIME NOT GARDEN GROVE ANAHEM -- WHEN I WAS A SOPHOMORE I THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD A GUN ON ME -- THAT YEARS LATER -- MY FRIEND ABRAHAM ORTEGA WAS KILLED WALKING OUTSIDE OF THE SOCCER FIELD. I REMEMBER JUST TALKING TO HIM SHORTLY AFTER HE WALKED. TO THE SOCCER FIELD -- WHEN I GRADUATED MY MOTHER FRIEND TO FIGURE SEAL WAS KILLED ON HIS BIRTHDAY? ARM IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ISRAEL VIA WAS KILLED BY TESTING PD. ARM AND IN. TWENTY TWELVE I WAS I LIVED THROUGH THE ANAHEIM UPRISINGS. AM THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING MILA TRIED IT MILITARY OCCUPIED WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND I HAD A MACHINE GUN POINTED AT ME. BY POLICE OR MILITARY. SO PART OF A IS LIKE OR WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. HI WHERE IS THAT KIND ABILITY. OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND I THINK FOR THAT WE WE DEFINITELY SEE THAT ARE IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY OVER HALF OF THE BUDGET GOES TO POLICE DEPARTMENT. AS SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE CITY TO INVESTING YOU. AND AND WE YOU KNOW HOW IS IT THAT THAT THE NUMBER ONE THE NUMBER ONE RESPONSE. TO PUT THAT TO YOUTH BEHAVIOR THAT THE CITY HAS AS A POLICE DEPARTMENT. SO WHAT WE'RE ADVOCATING IS A QUEEN FORMER -- THE WHAT WHAT WAS WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER WHERE WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF DEPARTMENTS OF YOU THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AT THE CITY LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT LOOKS LIKE A B.. SIX FIFTY SIX OFFICE AND HEALING AND SAFE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND PART OF THAT IS LIKE -- YOU KNOW WHY DO YOU SEE AS AN EXAMPLE OF OF THIS EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE NOT JUST COMMITTEE INTERVENTION WORKERS BUT TRANSFORMATIVE COMMUNITY WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE DOING WORK AROUND. SHARE INFORMATION OF WHAT IT IS TO HAVE TO BILL TRANSFORMATIVE CON ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO HOW CAN FAMILIES GENERATE ELK COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. INDIVIDUAL RESILIENCE WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING THE RISK FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO GUN VIOLENCE IN A TRANSFORMATIVE WAIT THAT LEADS TO CHOP SELF TRANSFORMATION THAT'S CULTURALLY ROOTED. TRAUMA INFORMED IT'S WERE TALKING ABOUT HEALING AND CELL TRANSFORMATION I AGAIN I HAD CALLED EFFORTS AND AND THAT -- THE SUGGESTIONS -- TO AND WITH THE WAR ON GANGS THAT'S ONLY GONNA CONTINUE TO CREATE IN A MISTRUST AMONG IN THE COMMUNITY WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM A WHAT WE CALL THE PUNISHMENT SYSTEM -- AND MORE IMPORTANTLY AS WELL I THINK THAT IN THIS CONTEXT RIGHT NOW WE WE HAVE THE CASE OF ANTHONY NOON YES AND IN SAN JOSE AND CURRENTLY I ALTHOUGH THE JURY'S GOING TO REACH A VERDICT ANYTIME SOON THIS WEEK. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE PASSING OF AB THREE NINETY TWO ODD. LET US LIVE SAVE OUR BILL SAVE SAVE OUR LIVES AND THE USE OF FORCE BILL SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I THINK THAT WE WE ARE -- ON THE JOURNEY INA PATH FOR FORT SUB TRANSFORMATION AS WE CONTINUE TO BE TO TRY TO AND AND ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN EFFORTS. TO ADDRESS THE CYCLES OF BONDS IN A COMMUNITY AWAY DOLLARS SO HOLD Z. SYSTEMS ARE ACCOUNTABLE SPECIFICALLY THE SYSTEMS I HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE BONDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT. JULIE'S THIBODEAU ADVANCE PEACE SACRAMENTO MY COLLEAGUE OVER THERE ROTH SAM GONNA. SO I'M SITTING HERE IN ARMS LISTEN IN.

A CABLE OUT ANGER INSIDE AND GUESS WHAT IS GOING TO GROW UP LIKE A VOLCANO ONE DAY. IT IS GOING TO COME OUT IN INDIANA AND HEALTHY MAN. SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE I DON'T SEE WHY WE GOT I CAN TAKE A PHONE. AND WE GOT ELECTRICITY WE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING THE CARS IN A I DON'T KNOW HIGH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL IS GOING TO DO WITH THAT BUT HEY WE TALKING ABOUT DOING. WE CAN PUT ANGER MANAGEMENT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. BECAME PRETTY EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY WHEN I'VE BEEN RAISED BY A SINGLE MOTHER. WHO DOING HER BEST? I THINK SHE'S DOING THE RIGHT THING BY TELLING ME NOT TO CRY. WHEN I'M THREE NO MAN I'M BEING TOLD TO BE A MAN AT? THREE THAT'S ONE ISSUE ANOTHER ISSUE. YOU HEAR THE NEWS I HEARD IN THIS ROOM SEVERAL TIMES. GUNS ARE GETTING IN THE HANDS OF WRONG P. O. THE WRONG PEOPLE. WHEN YOU HEAR THAT WHAT YOU THINK YOU THINK GUYS GET IN THE HAVE IN THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS GANG BANGERS NOT AT DAY DOESN'T STOP THERE? GUNS ARE BEING HANDED TO OFFICERS WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE WILL DO. HE'S NOT QUALIFIED. TO HAVE A GOOD HE'S NOT EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT ENOUGH OR MENTALLY STABLE ENOUGH. HE HAS BEEN DEEMED COMPETENT NOT YOU HAVE THESE COMPETENCY TRIAL THURMOND AND STUFF TO SEE A BOMB BEING COMPETENT. TO STAND TRIAL. WELL WE DON'T DO THIS FOR A LONG FORCE. THE BROTHER GOT UP DEAR HE TALKED ABOUT DRUG TESTING LAW ENFORCEMENT ON NOBODY STEM FROM BECAUSE THEY THEY DRUG TESTIFYING CLARK. RATING GET TODAY BUT I KNOW THAT'S WHAT HE STANDS FOR MY NO BEARD. AND WE WERE ALL SHOCKED LIVE. HE'S THE VICTIM. WHY WASN'T THE PERSON WHO MURDERED HIM OR THE PEOPLE WHO MURDERED HIM WHY WEREN'T THEY DRUG TEST? SO SO A LOT OF FLORA THINGS THEY SEEM LIKE AN EASY FIX TO MEAN DROP WOULD BE. THAT MY SUSPICIONS ARE CORRECT WHEN I THINK THIS IS SYSTEM. I THINK THAT WHEN I THINK THAT. WITH ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY AND ALL THE WISE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT THEY DON'T REALIZE. WHAT'S GOING ON IN WHAT COULD BE EASILY PUT A STOP TO THIS. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? BECAUSE ONE THING WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN [inaudible] MORE BENEFITING. I JUST SAW ARTICLE -- IN THE PAPER ABOUT -- OPENED A REGULAR BEAT COP. MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OVERTIME MILLIONS. THEY PROFIT OFF OF US KILLING ONE ANOTHER. WHO FEELS THREATENED? THAT'S ALL I ASK WHO FEELS THREATENED BY US HAVING PEACE IN OUR COMMUNITY. BECAUSE WE ARE THREATENING SOMEONE'S LIVELIHOOD. SOMEONE WHO HAS AN EXTRA HOME AN EXTRA BOWL THE MINISTERS ON I'M JUST SAYING SO THESE ARE THESE ARE TO ME. THINGS THAT WE COULD DO. AND I DON'T WANT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S CHALLENGES IN ROLE BLOCKS WHEN WE TRIED WE MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO DO THESE THINGS. SOMEBODY ELECTED DATING GUY REPEAT. YOU KNOW SO WE DON. BODY HAVING GET YEAH I HAD A YOUNG PART HE HAD A STROKE A THIRD. BECAUSE WE SITTING UP PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS BUT WE CAN'T. KEEP THE THINGS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT ALLOW US TO BE THE BEST INDIVIDUALS THAT WE CAN BE. HEALTHY. AND I'M TALKING MIND BODY AND SOUL. THESE THINGS SEEM LIKE EASY FIX TO ME. BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON WE AREN'T DOING. AND I JUST HAVE TO WONDER WHO'S PROFITING. OFF OF A OUR OUR NEGLIGENCE. ARE BEING STAGNANT OR UNWILLINGNESS TO DO SO OR AGAIN I CAN GET ALL INTO THE WORD THE CLAUSE IN THE WORD THE FACT. ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ATTEND PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE THEY BEEN DEEMED WORTHY ENOUGH FOR THE SERVICES. SAAD I COULD GO ON AND ON LIKE OTHER BROTHERS SAVE. WHEN I'M CLOSE WITH THAT I THINK IT BEARS SOME EASY THINGS THAT WE COULD DO? TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ARMING OPERAS WITH THE YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION BROTHERS AND SELLS COALITION -- MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH POLICE WAS WHEN I WAS TWENTY ONE LAPD. THE FIRST THING THE OFFICERS DO A PULLED UP BEHIND ME -- ONE OF THEM RUNS FROM THE PASSENGER DOOR HE OPENS IT UP AND HE JUMPED UP TOP OF THE HOOD OF THE JAGUAR THAT I WAS DRIVING. AND HE TOLD ME DO ANYTHING STUPID I'LL I'LL KILL YOU. AND YOU KNOW THESE WORDS JUST STILL RESONATES SO AS THEY BECAUSE LIKE. THIS WHERE LAPD IS ABOUT YOU KNOW KILLING. LIKE WE CAME BE WRITING IN A NICE CAR OR BE ANYWHERE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WITHOUT BEING THREATENED OR YOU KNOW. HAVING LIBERTY OF DO ANYTHING WE WANT THESE ARE CALLING COMMUNITIES AND I'M SAYING AND ANY TEAM THAT FEELS THAT TYPE AWAY. THERE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO CARRY A GUN BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT HE THREATENED ME ALREADY. HE ALREADY THREATEN ME IT'S ALWAYS AND KILL ME. SO WHAT AM I WAITING FOR WHEN THE KILL ME. SO -- YOU KNOW THESE THESE TEAMS THE A LOT OF RESOURCES. MENTALLY EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY ANY TO BE HEALED AND LIKE THE BROTHER FROM ME BY HERE YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY HELP THE KIDS OUT ALL THE TIME AND YOU KNOW ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESS IN TRACK RECORDS THAT THIS HELPS. AND THEY NEED MORE FUN BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST. THAT ONE LITTLE KID A THERE'S A LOT OF THESE LITTLE KIDS THAT ARE OUT THERE GETTING TRAUMATIZED BY COPS IN A THREATEN. EACH AND EVERY DAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. I WANT TO WE HAVE NO THIS WEEK YES PLEASE. YOU WILL BE THE FIRST FEMALE WAS SPOKEN HERE TODAY. SO IF AT ALL ALL MEN. IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PRESSURE. TO MAKE A STELLAR SPEAK -- WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS HEARING I THINK IT'S HISTORIC I DON'T REMEMBER EVER THERE BEING HEARING ON THIS TOPIC BEFORE -- I THINK THAT FOR ALL OF US THAT BEEN THROUGH THE SYSTEM THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING AND FOR SURE WE WERE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE LONG BEFORE WE EVER HEARD ANYBODY ELSE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE CRIMINAL AND JUVENILE IN JUSTICE SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY -- THERE IS SOME OBVIOUS THINGS THAT I THINK WE CAN SAY ABOUT WHY GUNS HIT OUR STREETS BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT. SO COMMONLY TALKED ABOUT SO I MIGHT SAY THINGS AND I'M SURE EVERYTHING I'M GONNA SAY EVERYBODY HERE ALREADY KNOWS. THE FIRST THING TO KNOW IS THAT -- LA COUNTY HAS BEEN EPICENTER OF HANDGUN MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION FOR THE WORLD FOR A LONG TIME. UNTIL JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THERE THAT AREA OF THE ORANGE COUNTY LA COUNTY AND I'M RIVERSIDE COUNTY WAS KNOWN AS THE RING OF FIRE. EVEN THE FBI SAID THAT ABOUT 86% OF THE HANDGUN CRIMES IN UNITED STATES WERE ATTRIBUTED BACK TO A GUN CREATED RIGHT THERE. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INTERNAL DOCUMENTS OF THOSE COMPANIES MANY OF THEM HAD -- DOCUMENTS THAT STATED THAT A LOT OF THEIR GUNS DISAPPEARED ON THE WAY TO THE TRAIN YARDS -- IN THE EAST SIDE OR ON THE WAY TO THE ON PORTS ON THE SOUTH SIDE. AND YET WHO GOT BLAMED FOR GUN VIOLENCE IN LOS ANGELES IN THE NATION YOUNG BLACK AND BROWN YOUTH ESPECIALLY MEN -- THOSE COMPANIES MADE HUGE PROFITS AND STILL HAVE YET TO PAY A PEACE DIVIDEND BACK TO THE COMMUNITY GOT SO HURT -- FOR MYSELF BEING WHITE COMING UP KNOWS CAN USE ALL THE LEAST IMPACTED BUT GUN VIOLENCE IN IN MY FAMILY AND IN MY COMMUNITY WAS AN EVERYDAY REALITY SO. WHETHER IT WAS RUNNING FROM GUNS -- BEING ONE TIME IN A CAR WHERE SOMEONE PUT A GUN OUTSIDE TO MY FOREHEAD AND THEN -- CHASED US FOR BLOCKS OR FINDING MY OWN FAMILY'S GUN BEHIND THE LIQUOR BOTTLES -- BECAUSE IT WAS REAL CLEAR IN OUR HOUSE THAT -- AND IN MOST HOUSES THAT WHEN VIOLENCE HAPPENS IS USUALLY LIQUOR INVOLVED AND THAT'S THE WORST PLACE TO PUT A GUN BUT OFTEN A COMMON PLACE TO PUT A GUN. THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT -- LA COUNTY ALSO HAS BEEN THE EPICENTER FOR POLICE VIOLENCE FOR NOT ONLY THE NATION BUT THE WORLD -- WE HAD POLICE VIOLENCE GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO EARLY HISTORY EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT SO FROM EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE LA COUNTY HAVE THE HIGHEST LYNCHING RATE IN THE NATION IT WAS CALLEBAUT MANAT ALABAMA THAT HAD THAT THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE. AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THE ORIGINAL TERMS AROUND GANG VIOLENCE CAME FROM. SOMEONE BROWN PEOPLE FOUGHT BACK TO TRY TO RECLAIM LAND THAT WAS TAKEN ILLEGALLY THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY LABELED AS BANDITS AND THAT'S WHERE THAT LYNCHING RAY CAME FROM. WHEN CHINESE PEOPLE WERE SEEN AS A THREAT BECAUSE THEY WERE MOVING INTO LA COUNTY USED IN TERMS OF NUMBERS -- AND THERE WAS A TONGUE MASS A TONGUE CHEWED OUT WHERE A WHITE PERSON WAS ACCIDENTALLY KILLED. THAT WAS USE AN EXCUSE TO TO BURN DOWN CHINATOWN AND STILL BY MATT ELIAS MASS LYNCHING IN US HISTORY EIGHTEEN PEOPLE LYNCHED AND AS MANY AS EIGHTY THREE PEOPLE KILLED THAT NIGHT. AND SO LAW ENFORCEMENT LED THOSE EFFORTS IN LA COUNTY AND IN CALIFORNIA -- IT WAS ALSO THE TIME OF THE MORE THE HIGHEST EXTERMINATION NATIVE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES NOT TO SAY IT DIDN'T HAPPEN EVERYWHERE BUT 90% THE NATIVE POPULATION WAS WIPED OUT. AND ALL OF THAT HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE THE CREATION OF OUR USE OF FOR STANDARD SO ARE YOU SO FOR STANDARD WAS USED AS A AS A OPPORTUNITY OR IS A RESOURCE TO EXCUSE ALL THOSE ACTIONS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WE'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THAT CULTURE OF VIOLENCE EVER SINCE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE OR COMMUNITIES BEING VIOLENT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE THE VIOLENCE COMES FROM -- THE SECOND THING I THINK IS REALLY ESSENTIAL TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW MILITARIZATION OF POLICE STILL EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I UNLIKE ANTHONY I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE ARMED I DON'T WANT ANY OF US HAVE GUNS HAVING HAD GUNS PULLED ON ME. I'M VERY AFRAID OF GUNS AND I'M ALSO VERY RESPECTFUL OF WHAT THEY CAN DO AND I PERSONALLY DON'T TRUST ANYBODY WITH A GUN -- SO I I WOULD BE HAPPY OF ALL GUNS REMOVED FROM THE PLANET AND I I AND I'M GLAD FOR TOUGH GUN CONTROL. BUT THAT BEING SAID WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED MILITARIZATION OF POLICING. SO FOR EXAMPLE -- OUR SCHOOLS LOOK AND OPERATE A LOT MORE LIKE PRISONS -- THAN THEY USED TO WITH SECURITY FENCING SURROUNDING THEM WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH METAL DETECTORS WITH POLICE TAKING OVER SCHOOL SECURITY. MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOW HAVE POLICE SCHOOL DEPARTMENTS -- LOS ANGELES UNIFIED AS A LARGEST SCHOOL POLICE DEPARTMENT IN THE NATION WE HAVE MORE POLICE AND PROBATION OFFICERS ON OUR SCHOOLS THAN WE DO GUIDANCE COUNSELORS. AND CALIFORNIA BEING THE RICHEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY AND THE FIFTH WHAT IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD NOW -- WE HAVE THE LOWEST RATIO -- SCHOOL COUNSELORS TO STUDENTS WITH ONE COUNSELOR FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND SIXTEEN STUDENTS THEN YET WHERE THE MOST MILITARIZED SCHOOLS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY TO THAT A LOT OF THIS CAME AFTER COLUMBINE -- BUT IN CALIFORNIA IT CAME PRE COLUMBINE. WE WERE ALREADY MILITARIZE IN OUR SCHOOLS LONG BEFORE THERE WAS A SCHOOL VIOLENCE CRISIS. AND THEN EVEN IF YOU TALK ABOUT COLUMBINE AS A SCHOOL SHOOTING EPICENTER LIKE A BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT LOCKING DOWN SCHOOLS WE LOOK MORE LIKE PRISONS. IF YOU LOOK AT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS IN THE UNITED STATES 98% THE SHOOTERS WERE WHITE 9896% OF THE VICTIMS WERE WHITE ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS. YET THE SCHOOL THEY GET LOCKED DOWN OUR COMMUNITY IN INCOME IS A COLOR COMBINE STILL DOESN'T HAVE FENCING AROUND IT STILL HAS ONLY ONE METAL DETECTORS SANDY HOOK THOSE SCHOOLS IN THAT DISTRICT. STILL HAVE NO METAL DETECTORS AND FENCING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT KIND OF CLIMATE IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO LEARNING. AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES NEVER GET TO NEVER INDOOR THOSE KIND OF QUALITIES AND SO THESCHOOLS THAT HAVE NOT HAD POLICE VIOLENCE HE'S HUGE MASS SHOOTINGS. HAVE GOTTEN ALL THE LOCKDOWN -- POLICE IN SCHOOLS SO WE NEED TO MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO REMOVE POLICING FROM SCHOOLS AND TO DEMILITARIZE OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. SIMILARLY OUT OF LA COUNTY CAME MILITARIZED POLICING SO THE FIRST CREATION OF SWAT OUT OF LA COUNTY THE FIRST USE OF HELICOPTERS BY THE SHERIFF'S AGAINST A CIVILIAN POPULATION -- TAKE DOWN DOORS AND THOSE THOSE. THOSE ARE MECHANISMS OF POLICING HAVE NOW SPREAD NATIONWIDE AND WORLDWIDE IT'S WHAT WE'VE EXPORTED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. SIMILARLY YOU KNOW LA COUNTY IS CALLED LIKE THE YOU KNOW THE BEGINNING A GANG ACTIVITIES CALL GANG ACTIVITY WOULD I WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVITY. BUT FOR DEPORTATION WE NOW HAVE TAKEN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS INTERNATIONAL TO ALL BECAUSE WE'VE DEPORTED PEOPLE OUT OF ALL THE COUNTY INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH OUR VIOLENCE AT HOME -- LASTLY I WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS A MYTH THAT KEEPS GIVING POP PROMOTED EVERY TIME WE BRING UP POLICEVIOLENCE -- WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OTHERS IN LA COUNTY HAS BY FAR THE HIGHEST USE OF FORCE RESULTING IN HOMICIDE IN THE NATION -- IT WITH AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR PEOPLE KILLED IN LA COUNTY BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BETWEEN FIFTY FOUR AT LEAST KILLED -- WE HAVEN'T EVEN DONE THE NUMBERS AS WELL WE CAN'T GIVE AN EXACT ESTIMATE EXACT NUMBER FOR THE LAST YEAR -- SO WE'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO NEW YORK NOT EVEN CLOSE -- TO CHICAGO AND OTHER CITIES WHERE THEY HAVE POLICE VIOLENCE PROBLEMS. AND I THINK ONE OF THE KEY REASONS FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE WARRING GANGS IN THE WAR ON DRUGS CAME OUT OF LA COUNTY THAT WAS SPREAD WORLDWIDE. AND IT CREATES A CULTURE OF LOCKDOWN CONTAINMENT AND CONTROL WHICH IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS FOR COMMUNITIES. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO IF WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE IS CHANGE THE NARRATIVE ABOUT BLACK ON BLACK AND BROWN AND BROWN VIOLENCE -- BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE THAT COMES FROM OUR GOVERNMENT AND THE WAY THAT COMMUNITIES ARE PATROLLED. AND THEN THAT THAT -- CREATES A DESPERATION THAT THAT FEEDS INTO THE VANS WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- AND IF WE LOOKED AT VIOLENCE ACROSS THE SECTOR MORE WHITE PEOPLE KILL WHITE PEOPLE MORE ASIAN PEOPLE KILL ASIAN PEOPLE BUT YOU NEVER HEAR THE TERM WHITE ON WHITE VIOLENCE -- SO I THINK THAT REALLY AGAIN -- APPLIED THIS HEARING. AND HOPE IT COMES WITH -- REAL LEGISLATION TO FOLLOW AND APPRECIATE YOUR COURAGE AND IN HAVING. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FIRST OF ALL -- LET'S GIVE EVERYONE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ONE BEING HERE AFTER SEPARATING. LET ME JUST SAY THIS THAT -- I RECEIVE YOU KNOW A LOT OF INFORMATION I APPRECIATE THE VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION I DON'T WANT THIS JUST TO BE A A ONE NIGHT WONDER KIND OF SELECT COMMITTEE I WANTED TO BE IN. A SELECT COMMITTEE -- THAT IS ACTIVE BUT IS PRO ACTIVE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO CREATE REAL SOLUTIONS SO THAT -- ONE THAT WE CAN BRING A WHITE PAPER -- THAT MAKES SENSE THAT A SIGNIFICANT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEM TO PONDER OVER AND HOPEFULLY IMPLEMENT POLICIES -- ACT AS A WAY IN A VOICE TO CREATE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT ABOUT HIS STREET IN THAT TODAY. AND I APPRECIATE -- ALL THE AGREE OX IN THE ROOM OF THOSE HISTORY MAKERS WHO OF REGURGITATED WHO'VE STUDIED VERY LEARNED IN THIS AREA IN TERMS OF THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES AWARE OF CUT WHERE ALL THE STUFF HAS COME FROM. BUT I WANT TO CHALLENGE EACH IN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US TO MAKE HISTORY TODAY BY WRITING A NEW NARRATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT BASED ON WHAT YOU SHARE TODAY WE CAN WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE WE HAVE THE THE WHEEL HERE IN THIS ROOM -- TO RIDE IN THE NARRATIVE OF CALIFORNIA WE TALKED ABOUT BATTERING RAM TO TALK ABOUT -- LACK OF FUNDING IN SCHOOLS AND COUNSELORS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE WHAT HELP US RIGHT A NEW NARRATIVE SO THAT THAT WON'T BE THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES -- THIS TIME NEXT YEAR OR THIS TIME IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOPEFULLY FIND OUR SCHOOLS WE HAVE EVERY SCHOOL -- YOU WON'T BE ONE CONCERT FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS BUT IT TO BE A A NICE RATIO THAT'S MANAGEABLE SO WE CAN HAVE COUNSELORS ON CAMPUS. AND ALSO THE WE HAVE SENSITIVITIES IN TRAINING WERE POLICE OFFICERS CAN RECEIVE THE KIND OF TRAINING TO GOING TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND BE ABLE TO LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS. AS INDIVIDUALS AND NOT EVERYONE LOOKING AT LOOKING AT SOMEONE WHO HAS -- AS A SUSPECT -- WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW POLICE VERSES GET PLACING GANGS WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT PUT ALL THE BLAME WHEN IT COMES OUT TO POLICE WE ALSO LOOK ON A BLACK ON BLACK CRIME BLACK ON BLACK ON BROWN. CRIME AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE IT'S ALL OF US AND WE WE LOOK AT THE OLD -- AFRICAN ADAGES TAKES ENTIRE VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD WHO WE ARE THAT VILLAGE AND WE NOW HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO TRY TO ADDRESS. THE ISSUES WITH IN THAT BILL IS IN ORDER FOR THE BILL IS TO HEAL AND SO THAT WE CAN DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF GANG VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SO. EACH OF YOU HAVE BROUGHT SO MUCH INFORMATION SO MUCH CLARITY THAT WE WE'VE GONE CHRONICLING THIS INTO A WHITE PAPER -- WE HAVE NOT YET SET THE DATE FOR THE LOS ANGELES -- HEARING ON SELECT COMMITTEE ON GUN BUYERS WILL BE MOVING THE NEXT HEARING IN LOS ANGELES AND THE OAKLAND AND IN OTHER AREAS AND WE INVITE YOU TO BE PART OF THAT BUT ALSO.
