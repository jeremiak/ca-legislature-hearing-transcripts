WHAT OF OKAY [inaudible] YOUR SALAS. THANK YOU WILSHIRE PRESENT SB FIVE HUNDRED IS A PLAN TO EXPAND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATES RETURNING DISABLED VETERANS. I DO HAVE -- WOULD JUST AS HERE IN SUPPORT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. THE WITNESSES PLEASE THANK YOU. OF FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN ARMS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE THE BANKS IN A ROW AND A HOST OF OTHER SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN INTRODUCING SUCH A TREMENDOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. DESIGNED TO HELP THE VETERANS OF CALIFORNIA. MY NAME IS CLAIRE IS THE LIST AND I AM A DISABLED VETERAN. I'M SORRY I'M A DISABLED AIRFORCE VETERAN AND I AM ALSO RESIDENT CALIFORNIA. I HAD THE HONOR OF CENTER SERVING THE WORLD'S GREATEST AIR AND SPACE POWER. FOR A PERIOD OF ELEVEN YEARS AND NINE MONTHS. I SERVED IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM OPERATION DOING FREEDOM AND TWO CONSECUTIVE TOURS AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA. BY SO MANY OF MY OF MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN ARMS. BECAME A CRESSMAN A CRESSMAN A PERFORMING MY DUTIES IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. LIKE SO MANY OF OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN ARMS THE SUM OF ALL THOSE FEARS WERE FORMING A CLAMP PRESIDENT JR PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE FAIR REJOINING OUR BELOVED COUNTRY AS A CIVILIAN. BECOMING A CIVILIAN AGAIN AS HARD BECAUSE OF THE THINGS WE MAY HAVE HAVE WE MAY HAVE GONE THROUGH OUT WE SERVED. THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN IS THAT OUR WARTIME IN PEACE TIME DUTIES ARE NONTRANSFERABLE TO THE CIVILIAN SECTOR. THIS MEANS THAT IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AFTER SERVING WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE. THE MAJORITY OF HAT THE MAJORITY OF US HAVE THE GI BILL WHICH IS SUFFICIENT FORCE TO COMPLETE OUR BATCHES AGREE. BUT IN MANY CASES THAT DOES NOT MAKE US COMPATIBLE CUT COMPETITIVE ENOUGH TO SCORE THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT WE NEED TO SUSTAIN FOR OUR FAMILIES. THIS DIRECTLY MEANS THAT IN ORDER FOR SOME VETERANS TO BE TRULY COMPETITIVE ENOUGH WORKFORCE WE MUST ACHIEVE HIGHER THAN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. WHEN IT COMES TO ACHIEVING HIGHER THAN A BASS IS AGREED NORMALLY A VETERAN HAS EXHAUSTED OR NEARLY EXHAUSTED ALL OF THEIR GI BILL? THIS IS WHERE THE VOCATIONAL REHAB BUT REHABILITATION COMES INTO PLAY AND IT CAN PROVIDE THE LAST BLUES A VETERAN NEEDS TO ACHIEVE THAT COMPETITIVE EDGE FOR GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. ALTHOUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF VETERANS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR VOCATIONAL REHAB NOT ALL VETERANS CAN AND RECEIVE THE ENTITLEMENT OF OCCASIONAL REHAB. AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS IS OVER YES AT THE DAY HAVE BEEN TOLD NO. WE ARE HERE FOR CALIFORNIA VETERANS WHO NEED TO COMPLETE OR ACHIEVE THEIR HIGHER DEGREE BUT CAN'T RECEIVE THE BACKING THEY NEED FROM VOCATIONAL REHAB. LET US BE REALISTIC. SB FIVE HUNDRED IS THE FINAL SAVING GRACE. THAT ONLY A FEW VETERANS WILL NEED ALTHOUGH OF ACTUAL ALTHOUGH BACHELOR DEGREES ARE THE NORM NOT EVERY VETERAN WILL NEED HIGHER THAN A BACHELOR'SDEGREE. AND MOST VETERANS NEED HIGHER THAN A BASS IT'S AGREE WILL BE HELPED BY VOCATIONAL REHAB. SB FIVE HUNDRED IS THE YES WHEN THE LAST OF US HAVE BEEN TOLD NO. THIS JUST MEANS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE CAN NO LONGER BE HEROES FOR OUR COUNTRY WE CAN BE HEROES FAR FAMILIES. WHEN THE AVERAGE BETTER RETURNS TO THE CIVILIAN SECTOR HERE SHE RETURNS WITH THE FAMILY? A MONTHS THE STRAIN OF DISABILITY WHO SCARS ARE SEEN AND UNSEEN. THE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR ONE'S FAMILY IN SPITE OF INJURY AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF TIME IS PARAMOUNT. AGAIN SB FIVE HUNDRED IS THAT SAVING GRACE THAT SUPPORTS THE VETERAN'S FAMILY WHILE THE VETERAN BECOMES WHAT HE OR SHE NEEDS TO BE FOR THEIR FAMILY. SB FIVE HUNDRED IS A YES TO THE VETERAN AND HIS FAMILY OR HER FAMILY WHEN ALL OTHER AVENUES HAVE BEEN DEPLETED. AND AND NO AND NO. ONE AND NO WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE FINAL ANSWER. GOD BLESS YOU ALL GOD BLESS CALIFORNIA GOD BLESS AMERICA.

ALL RIGHT WELL I AM MODE OLD LAWYERS SO WHEN I HAVE A TENTATIVE IT'S IN MY FAVOR THEN I KNOW TO BE QUIET BUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MIKE MY I'M GUESSING THAT YOU YOU WANT ME TO ACTUALLY RESPOND SO -- YOU HAVE A FEW WORDS TO SAY TO THANK YOU PERSONAL THANK YOU TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF. THE BILL WAS NEARLY PERFECT AND NOW IT'S PERFECT WELL EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE SMALL EXCEPTIONS. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE HELP AND ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE YOUR STEPS PROVIDED -- THE WORK ON THIS BILL REALLY BEGIN A TWO THOUSAND FIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL MAKING SURE THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. FOR THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD MILITARY DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY PROVIDES THE KIND OF OVERSIGHT INSPECTION THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT PROVIDES THAT CERTAIN COMPLAINTS WOULD GO TO THE GOVERNOR AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE THE THE TAG. AND ALSO PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- THE THE COMMITTEE HAS SUGGESTED THAT THAT -- THERE A COUPLE ISSUES WITH THE BILL ONE ISSUE IS IT BEGINS BY SAYING AT THE DISCRETION OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CERTAIN. INSPECTIONS ARE MANDATED AND WE DO NEED TO FIX THAT AND WE'LL HAVE BE FIXED IT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. MADAM CHAIR OF IT IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND THE COMMITTEE SO KIND AS TO PERMIT THE BILL TO MOVE FORWARD -- IN IN ALSO -- THERE'S BEEN A SUGGESTION THAT WE CHANGE THE SHALL TO MAY WITH RESPECT TO MANDATE INSPECTIONS -- THE THE THE WORD SHALL IS INTENTIONAL SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE FOR MEMBER LEGISLATURE -- REQUEST INSPECTION BE DONE THAT THAT INSPECTION ACTUALLY DONE OF COURSE INSPECTOR GENERAL -- CAN DEVOTE WHATEVER TIME AND EFFORT HERE SHE DEEMS IS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT AND ALSO THE OTHER ISSUE IS WITH RESPECT -- TO AN ALLEGATION BY MEMBER THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- THAT THAT NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE -- INVESTIGATED THAT IS UP TO THE DISCRETION OF OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL BUT CERTAINLY A MEMBER THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT MAKES ALLEGATION ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT MANDATED INSPECTED -- AND THEN THE AGAIN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HERE SHE CAN DEVOTE THE TIME AND EFFORT ATTENTION AS DEEMED NECESSARY. ALL RIGHT UP MISTER BARTH IS HERE -- AS WITNESS BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS BART GIVE ANYTHING YOU WANTED THANK SEARCHES AND WANTED TO CONFIRM -- ALSO THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION -- SUPPORTS THE THE BILL BUT I'D BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. I CERTAINLY AND DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WE IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] REMEMBER VOEPEL. I SUPPORT THIS BILL IT'S A VERY GOOD BILL BUT I DID HAVE A MINOR NON LAWYER QUESTION. AND THAT IS -- CURRENTLY UNDER EXISTING LAW SAYS MAKES THE INSPECTOR GENERAL A PRINCIPAL ADVISER TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADJUTANT GENERAL. AND THEN -- THIS BILL CHANGES IT TO MAKES THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AN ADVISER TO THE GOVERNOR. pGENERAL WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THE DIFFERENCE IS IS THAT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. ACTUALLY REPORTS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF GOVERNOR BEING THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AS OPPOSED TO THE OF THE TAG. OKAY THANK YOU. SHOULD DEBT AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS JUST SIMPLY. MY LAST HELD RANK WAS IN THE SIX OKAY SO I'M OBVIOUSLY A COMMAND EXPERT FOR THE MILITARY RIGHT. SO IS MY EXPERIENCE THAT EASE SIXES ARE COMMAND EXPERTS ON HOME RIGHT [inaudible] SO. THIS IS -- BASED. IN A SOMEWHAT ORDERED INCIDENT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS IN THE CALIFORNIA AIR NATIONAL GUARD HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER INSTANCES SENSE THEN. SO -- SOME A MEMBER VOEPEL THIS ACTUALLY WAS BASED ON EFFORTS THAT I BEGIN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE OF MUCH PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT THAT YOU READ ABOUT IN THE IN THE NEWSPAPER -- I'M NOT SURE BUT THE THE ISSUE IS NOT ABOUT -- ONE PARTICULAR INCIDENT -- AND MEAN. TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM CLEAR I I THINK NATIONAL GUARD IS WELL LED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND SO. THIS IS -- AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. FROM YOU KNOW STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND HOPEFULLY CONTINUING FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. ROGER THAT SIR MADAM CHAIR -- DONE RIGHT -- THANK YOU AND WE HAVE -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS SIR I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR KEEPING IT AS A SHALLOW INSTEAD OF A MAY -- DEALING WITH GOVERNMENT WITHOUT THE SHALL.
