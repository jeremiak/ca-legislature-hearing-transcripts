00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:16.415
EVERYTHING WE CAN'T FIGHT FIRES

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:19.285
AND- SOCIETY STARTS TO SLOWLY

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:21.620
BREAK DOWN SO I APPRECIATE THE

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.090
URGENCY OF THIS AND I THINK THE

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:24.690
QUESTION I HAVE THE AUTHOR WAS

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:28.427
REALLY. I KNOW THERE'S SOME

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:30.396
ISSUES AROUND- AT THE AIR

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.697
QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:33.933
AND THEIR CONCERNS OF MY

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.670
CONCERN WAS PRIMARILY THAT. IN

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:39.071
THE SPACE OF WHAT KIND OF

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:40.139
TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE USED

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:41.707
HERE AND REALLY TO PUSH THE

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.009
WATER DISTRICTS TO ADOPT THE

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:45.411
CLEANEST ALTERNATIVES FEASIBLE

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.245
AND I KNOW YOU'VE LOOKED AT

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.414
THIS ISSUE AND GOING THROUGH

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.715
SOME THINKING THERE SO I JUST

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.684
WANTED TO POSE A QUESTION AND

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:55.821
ASK- IF THE BILL IS WHEN CLOSER

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:56.989
TO THE ASSEMBLY OF THERE'S AN

00:10:57.056 --> 00:11:02.194
INTENT TO- REQUIRE AT LEAST

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:04.397
THESE WATER DISTRICTS TO DO

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:04.964
SOME HOMEWORK AND JUST USE.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:05.898
THAT ALL THE BILLABLE THING AT

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.633
THE ADOPT CLEANER ALTER ISN'T

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.101
JUST DEFAULTING TO DIS SENATORS

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.470
AT A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR YES

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.039
WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUEST YES

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:16.876
THANK. YOU ANY INSTITUTION

PUTTING IN- ANY TYPE OF

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:20.446
GENERATORS TODAY SHOULD DO THE

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.049
DUE DILIGENCE. AND DO THE WORK

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:25.251
NECESSARY TO DETERMINE. WHAT

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:27.019
KIND OF CO TWO IS BEING OMITTED

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:30.356
FROM THERE SO- UTILIZING- THE-

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:32.191

THAT. THE ON THAT THAT

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:38.998
CERTAINLY IS NOT THE ANYTHING

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:40.900
THAT WE WOULD OPPOSE THE MOVING

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.835
IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK THAT

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:44.770
THIS BILL ALREADY GIVES THE

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:46.939
OPPORTUNITY- IT DOESN'T

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.941
PRECLUDE JUST IT IT IT DOESN'T

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:52.244
PRECLUDE THAT. AND HAPPY TO

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:55.714
LOOK AT THAT. THIS IS. TO LOOK

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:56.982
AT IT I JUST I HATE TO BE A

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.417
STICK BURNER BROUGHT UP WITH

00:11:58.484 --> 00:11:59.718

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:09.595
FIRE SEASON ALMOST WITH A 100%

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.297
DIESEL POWER IN THE NORTHERN

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:12.198
CALIFORNIA AREA AND I DON'T

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:14.400
THINK. THAT'S NOT REALLY A TRUE

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:17.002
CALIFORNIA SOLUTION SO JUST. I

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.771

OPEN THIS TO ADOPTING A

00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:21.807

THAT. THE REASON FOR THE BILL.

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.660
THE REASON FOR THE BILL IN THE

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:44.063
FIRST PLACE. IS BECAUSE WE'RE

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.867

LONG TERM SURE THE- SITUATION

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.340

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:03.789
CARE OF IN A MUCH BETTER WAY.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:06.392
SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:07.793
ON THE LIMITED INFORMATION THAT

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.827
I HAVE THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.929
BILL DOES. IT ALLOWS BACKUP

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:13.766
GENERATORS TO RESPOND. TO MATCH

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.567
NEEDED POWER SOURCES THAT ARE

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:18.971
NOT AVAILABLE DURING A PS PS.

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:19.571
AND THEY WILL NOT BE FINE BY

00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:21.106
THE CALIFORNIA- RESOURCES BOARD

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:22.007
EVEN IF THEY HAVE A PROTECT

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:23.809
WHICH MEANS PER YOU KNOW THAT.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.444
IT'S A PORTABLE TAG A PORTABLE

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:28.313
GENERATOR TAG. SO I. APPLAUD

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.015
THE AUTHOR FOR DOING THAT. OF

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:31.049

INDUSTRIES. THESE PEOPLE THAT

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.356
USE THESE- PORTABLE GENERATORS

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.558
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FIVE YEARS

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:41.360

THE IN THE- IN THE IN THE IN

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.847
THE TYPES OF SITUATIONS THAT

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:16.949
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP. THEY WERE

00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:19.117
TRYING TO IT ALLEVIATE AND AN

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:20.018
ADDRESS AND WITH REGARD TO THIS

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:21.753
BILL. THE AIRPORTS OF SAID IT

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.288
VERY CLEARLY THAT THEY WOULDN'T

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:24.122
FIND UNDER THOSE KINDS OF

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.190
CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE THEY

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:27.025
UNDERSTAND. THE DIFFICULTIES

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:31.863
AND THE- THE- THE- THE UNIQUE

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.165
CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE TS TS.

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.433
LET'S NOT LET'S NOT KID

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:35.300
OURSELVES THERE'S A LOT OF

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:36.668
POLLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.438
DIESEL GENERATORS. AND IF

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:40.439
ANYTHING. THE PROBLEM HERE THAT

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:43.842
WE'VE GOT A UTILITY. THAT HAS

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.644
NOT DONE THE WORK HAS NOT PUT

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:48.313
IN PLACE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.851
MITIGATE AND TO MINIMIZE THE

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:55.187
NEED FOR P. S. TS ADVANCE. AND

00:20:55.253 --> 00:20:56.822
AS A RESULT WE HAVE HOSPITALS

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:57.956
IN TOWNS LIKE THAT BEAUTIFUL

00:20:58.023 --> 00:20:59.958
TOWN THAT THE SENATOR TALKED

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:01.393
ABOUT UP IN THE MOUNTAINS THAT

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.794
ARE FORCED TO GO TO HEAVILY

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.730
POLLUTING DIESEL GENERATORS

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:06.465
THAT POWER AARON MIGHT MAKE

00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:07.833
THAT LITTLE TOWN A LITTLE LESS

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:10.769
PRETTY THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:11.336
THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:16.241
UTILITIES HAVE. HI FAILED. TO

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:17.342
DO ITS JOB AND IS RESULT THEY

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:19.478
HAVE THESE MASSIVE POWER SET US

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:19.978
ALL THROUGHOUT NORTHERN

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:21.513
CALIFORNIA. THAT RESULT IN THE

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.315
NEED FOR FOLKS TO POWER AND

00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:24.483
DIESEL POLLUTING DIESEL

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:25.917
GENERATORS AND SO THAT'S REALLY

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:27.586
THE HEART OF THIS PROBLEM HERE.

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:28.887
AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.188
THIS BILL TO CRAFTING A

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:32.024
COMPROMISE TO ALLOW. HOSPITALS

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.625
AND OTHER VITAL INSTITUTIONS TO

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:35.727
KEEP. RUNNING DURING DIFFICULT

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.362
TIMES HOW WE WANT TO ALLOW THE

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:39.498
NETFLIX ABILITY- BUT LET'S NOT

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:41.299
MAKEANY MISTAKE ABOUT WHAT.

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.635
WHO WHO THE REAL- VILLIAN IS

00:21:43.702 --> 00:21:45.737
HERE. AND LET'S ALSO NOT MAKING

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:47.406
A MISTAKE THAT. THESE DIESEL

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:50.208
GENERATORS ARE HEAVILY POLLUTED.

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:51.376
THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN SENATOR

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:57.282
DOLLY AB. TO GET THAT MIKE

THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES. THANK

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:08.527
YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TO I WAS

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:09.561
ANY Q. AS WELL WHEN HIS BILL

00:22:09.628 --> 00:22:11.196
CAME THROUGH AND ACTUALLY VOTED

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:14.299
AGAINST THIS BILL NOT BECAUSE-

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:17.235
I THINK IT WE WENT. I'M I'M

00:22:17.302 --> 00:22:18.303
WORRIED WE'RE GONNA GO TOO FAR

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.740
LOOK. THIS IS THE CHAIR OF THE

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:22.974
EQ BROUGHT UP SOME REALLY GREAT

00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:24.710
POINTS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:26.878
IS THAT HOSPITALS AND WATER

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:29.548
DISTRICTS. THEY DIDN'T CAUSE

00:22:29.614 --> 00:22:31.183
THIS PROBLEM UNIQUE BECAUSE

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:33.418
THIS PROBLEM BUT I HAVE IN OUR

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:36.221
IN OUR DISTRICT WE'VE HAD.

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:39.124
OUTAGES FOR. TEN TO TWELVE DAYS

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:40.125
AND EVEN LONGER IN SOME AREAS

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:41.927
OF THE DISTRICT WHERE THEY WERE

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:44.696
REQUIRED TO RUN THOSE.

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:46.565
GENERATORS TO PROVIDE. OUR OR

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:47.999
WATER INTO HAVE DEEPER HOSPITAL

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:52.404
RUNNING. THIS BILL COULD ALLOW

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:54.306
THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL IS TO

00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:55.340
COME IN AND FORCE THEM TO

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:56.408
BECAUSE THEY'RE RUNNING LONGER

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:57.509
PRISON THEY NORMALLY WOULD RUN

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:59.010
AND THERE IS A PULL BLOOM.

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:00.846
ASSOCIATE WITH THE- SO IF

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:02.647
YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A HOSPITAL.

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:04.616
THAT IS IN THAT SITUATION AND

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:05.784
AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICER

00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:07.652
COMES IN AND MANDATE YOU

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:08.587
CHANGED OUT BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:23:08.653 --> 00:23:09.755
POLLUTANTS. AND THESE ARE

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.323
DISTRICT HOSPITALS WE ACTUALLY

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:13.759
ASSESS OURSELVES TO PROPERTY

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:15.260
TAX SO WE CAN HAVE A HOSPITAL.

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:17.529
THAT COULD BE TWO TO THREE

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:18.096
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:20.599
THAT DISTRICT HOSPITAL. THAT IS

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.834
NOT THEIR FAULT. SO I'M

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.269
CONCERNED ABOUT IT GOING TOO

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:25.771
FAR THE OTHER WAY I VOTED

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.139
AGAINST THE BILL I'M GONNA LAY

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:28.206
OFF ON THE BILL BECAUSE I

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:29.908
BELIEVE. THE AUTHORS TRYING TO

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.343
STRIKE BOTH AUTHORS I SHOULD

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:32.778
SAY ARE TRYING TO STRIKE THE

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:35.213
BALANCE WHERE. LOOK IF THERE'S

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.548
AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:38.416
IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT. AND

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:39.785
THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.720
THEY SHOULD DO IT. IF THERE IS

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:43.822
A HARDSHIP AND THERE IS NOT THE

00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:44.990
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:45.924
THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO

00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:47.159
GENERATE AND PROVIDE THE

TO WORK IN PRIVATE RESIDENCE.

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:03.658
AND IF OSHA IS NOT ALLOWED TO

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:05.393

YOU KNOW WHEN YOU START MESSING

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:24.679
WITH SOMEONE'S PRIVATE

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:26.214
RESIDENCE AND THEIR PRIVATE

HOME. THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.552
HUGE ISSUE PERTAINING TO THAT

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:32.821
SO I WOULD ASK AGAIN. FOR BILLS

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:33.655
TO BE THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDERED

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.323
BEFORE THE MOVE FORWARD SO

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:37.492
THAT- IT CAN BE THE RIGHT WAY

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.460
INSTEAD OF PUTTING A LOT OF OUR

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:42.397

BUSINESSES THAT THEY DO SEE

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:48.370
SINCE DISORDERS THAT THEY STOP

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:49.404
PEOPLE FROM OPERATING THEIR

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:50.739
BUSINESS I MEAN IS GONNA FOLLOW

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:52.540
TRUE AND SET PRECEDENTS. FOR

HAPPENS IN A HOME SETTING IS A

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:07.822
GOING TO FOLLOW THE SAME PACE.

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:08.757
AS THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR

OR IS IT GOING TO BE HANDLED

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.127

RESPECT TO THE CONCERN HERE WE

01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:40.455
WRITE THE LAW WE IMPOSE THE

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:42.223
GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO FIND

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.159
PEOPLE TO TAKE AWAY THEIR

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:47.362
LIBERTY AND WE HAVE TO EXERCISE

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.564
THAT IN THE MOST ELEGANT AND

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.966
APPROPRIATE WAY. THE GREATEST

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:53.535
CHALLENGES AREN'T THOSE WITH

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.236
THE BLINDS OF BRIGHT. THE

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:56.805
GREATEST CHALLENGES OF THOSE

WITH THERE'S DEEPLY CONFLICTING

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:01.843
INTERESTS. PRIVACY AND WHAT

HAPPENS IN YOUR HOME AS WE HAVE

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:05.280
LOOKED AT THROUGHOUT THE

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:05.847
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IS

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.849
SACROSANCT. THAT MUST BE

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.984
BALANCED BY. THE OTHER

01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:12.220
IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE'VE

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:12.787
BEEN ARTICULATED HERE ON THE

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:15.857
FLOOR TODAY. BUT IF YOU HAVE A

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.759

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:19.561
HELP OUT THE CLEANED OUT

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:20.228
BECAUSE SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:21.896
ILL OR SOMETHING. AND THEY'RE

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:23.765
USING A DETERGENT THAT THEY

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:24.366
MIGHT NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.034
FORD BECAUSE THEY'RE SAVING

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:28.069
MONEY FOR THEIR KIDS TO BUY A

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:30.071

BE OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:35.643
TO PUT A NEW STAIR RAIL ON

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:36.544

TODAY. BUT I AM DEEPLY

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:50.759
CONCERNED ABOUT. THE ABILITY TO

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:53.128
DRAFT THIS IN A WAY. THAT

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.497
BALANCES THESE CRITICAL

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:57.799
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. IT IS

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:00.168
EASY TO FIND THE EXAMPLE. BUT

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:01.569
IT IS ALWAYS THE EXAMPLE THAT

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:03.171
FOLKS THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE EVERY

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:05.206
DAY WHERE SOMEBODY COMES IN.

ECONOMICALLY SOUND FOR OUR

02:02:37.516 --> 02:02:39.819
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIFTH.

02:02:39.885 --> 02:02:42.521
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. I

02:02:42.588 --> 02:02:44.090
JUST THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO

LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND REALIZE

02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:47.359
THAT GARMENT INDUSTRY WORKERS

LIVING THROUGH THAT TOM EVEN

02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:06.045

HAD TO GO IN AND DO THAT WORK.

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.348
AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE STAND

02:03:09.415 --> 02:03:10.816
UP FOR THOSE WORKERS AND WE

02:03:10.883 --> 02:03:12.885

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:45.124
RUBIO THANK YOU MADAM

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:47.826
PRESIDENT- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF

02:07:47.893 --> 02:07:50.062
THIS MEASURE AND I WANT ALSO

02:07:50.129 --> 02:07:51.730
STRAINING COACH MY COLLEAGUES

02:07:51.797 --> 02:07:53.999
TO SUPPORT IT AS WELL I MEAN I

02:07:54.066 --> 02:07:55.267
THINK MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES

02:07:55.334 --> 02:07:56.402
HAVE SPOKEN FROM LOS ANGELES

02:07:56.468 --> 02:07:58.937
COUNTY AT WORK THIS IS SO

02:07:59.004 --> 02:08:01.240
PREVALENT AND EVIDENT I GREW UP

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:03.575
IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES- AND

02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:04.910
JOB THAT'S FOR THE GARMENT

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:07.012
INDUSTRY IS. AND IF YOU EVER GO

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:08.847
INTO ANY OF THESE MANUFACTURERS

02:08:08.914 --> 02:08:10.582
IT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING TO

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:12.851
SEE I MEAN THERE'S A REASON WHY

02:08:12.918 --> 02:08:13.919
THEY CALL THEM SOMETIMES SWEAT

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:16.522
SHOPS AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE

02:08:16.588 --> 02:08:18.457
AND I'M VERY MINDFUL THAT IT'S

02:08:18.524 --> 02:08:21.960
NOT EVERY SINGLE MANUFACTURE.

02:08:22.027 --> 02:08:23.328
BUT IN PARTICULAR I'M SPEAKING

02:08:23.395 --> 02:08:24.863
ABOUT THE AREA LOS ANGELES

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:26.298
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WHICH WE

02:08:26.365 --> 02:08:28.033
CALL THE GARMENT INDUSTRY AND

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:31.136
SO I HAVE SEEN THE ABUSES IN

02:08:31.203 --> 02:08:33.272
THOSE INDUSTRIES AS I. WAS

02:08:33.338 --> 02:08:35.240
GROWING UP I KNOW A LOT OF

02:08:35.307 --> 02:08:36.842
FAMILIES THAT DON MADE THEIR

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:38.277
MONEY FROM WORKING IN THESE

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:40.446
INDUSTRIES AND SO I THINK IT'S

02:08:40.512 --> 02:08:42.114
AN IMPORTANT MEASURE- JUST

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:43.882
BASIC PROTECTIONS FOR THESE

02:08:43.949 --> 02:08:45.517
WORKERS AND AN ADEQUATE LIVING

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:48.053
WAGE IS IMPORTANT STILL I RISE

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.388
IN SUPPORT OF IT AND HOPE THAT

02:08:49.455 --> 02:08:52.357
YOU SUPPORTED TO THINKING. THAT

02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:53.859
A PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR.

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:56.562
SENATOR GROW AND THANK YOU

02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:57.930
MADAM PRESIDENT I WHAT I DID

02:08:57.996 --> 02:08:58.797
WAS I GOING TO SPEAK ON IT

02:08:58.864 --> 02:08:59.998
AGAIN BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:01.733
SURE THAT YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:03.802
THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SAYS

02:09:03.869 --> 02:09:05.137
THAT PIECE READING COMMISSION

02:09:05.204 --> 02:09:07.005
PAID EMPLOYEES MUST RECEIVE AT

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:09.074
LEAST MINIMUM WAGE. PEACE THREE

02:09:09.141 --> 02:09:11.877
EMPLOYEES MUST ALSO BE PAID AT

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:13.545
LEAST MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL THE

02:09:13.612 --> 02:09:14.880
TIME SPENT ON TASKS NOT

02:09:14.947 --> 02:09:16.515
SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED IN THEIR

02:09:16.582 --> 02:09:18.650
PIECE RATE UNDER THE NEW LABOR

02:09:18.717 --> 02:09:20.486
LAW EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO

02:09:20.552 --> 02:09:22.788
COMPENSATE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:24.389
PAID BY A PIECE THREE BASIS FOR

02:09:24.456 --> 02:09:25.757
THE REFER RESTED WE CAN FREE

02:09:25.824 --> 02:09:27.292
PERIODS AND OTHER NON

02:09:27.359 --> 02:09:28.961
PRODUCTIVE WORK TIME. SO THE

02:09:29.027 --> 02:09:31.230
LAW ALREADY STATES THAT ANYBODY

02:09:31.296 --> 02:09:33.732
PAIN PIECE RATE IS REQUIRED TO

02:09:33.799 --> 02:09:34.766
MAKE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:38.604
PAID MINIMUM WAGE. SO THIS BILL.

02:09:38.670 --> 02:09:40.339
I DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE- THE

02:09:40.405 --> 02:09:41.640
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS

02:09:41.707 --> 02:09:42.708
ENFORCEMENT CAN GO INTO THE

02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:44.443
GARMENT DISTRICT THREE GUYS ARE

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.311
SHARING THESE HORRIFIC STORIES.

02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:47.746
OF SOMEBODY WORKING SIXTY FIVE

02:09:47.813 --> 02:09:49.181
HOURS A WEEK AND MAKING THREE

02:09:49.248 --> 02:09:50.649
DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT IS

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:52.451
ILLEGAL UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE

02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:54.786
LAW ON HIS EMPLOYER I AM JUST.

02:09:54.853 --> 02:09:57.122
IT'S REPREHENSIBLE THAT SOMEONE

02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.689
WOULD TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES

02:09:57.756 --> 02:09:59.992
LIKE THAT. BUT THE LAW ALREADY

02:10:00.058 --> 02:10:01.226
EXIST IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:10:01.293 --> 02:10:02.628
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LABOR

02:10:02.694 --> 02:10:03.962
STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IS NOT

02:10:04.029 --> 02:10:05.931
DOING THEIR JOB BY NEGLECTING.

02:10:05.998 --> 02:10:07.633
GOING INTO THOSE FACILITIES

02:10:07.699 --> 02:10:08.867
THAT ARE IN THE LOS ANGELES

02:10:08.934 --> 02:10:10.569
GARMENT DISTRICT AREA. THEN

02:10:10.636 --> 02:10:12.070
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:12.971
TO ADDRESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT

02:10:13.038 --> 02:10:14.740
OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT.

02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:15.707
BUT TO PASS A PIECE OF

02:10:15.774 --> 02:10:17.509
LEGISLATION THAT SAYS YOU CAN

02:10:17.576 --> 02:10:19.611
ONLY PAID PIECE RATE. IF IT'S A

02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:21.046
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

02:10:21.113 --> 02:10:22.214
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:23.749
BENEFICIAL EITHER TO THE

02:10:23.815 --> 02:10:25.918
MANUFACTURE OR THE EMPLOYEE

02:10:25.984 --> 02:10:28.187
THEMSELVES. BECAUSE IF THE IF

02:10:28.253 --> 02:10:29.988
THE AGREEMENT ISN'T MADE THEN

02:10:30.055 --> 02:10:30.889
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL NOT BE

02:10:30.956 --> 02:10:32.658
ABLE TO BE PAID PIECE RATE. AND

02:10:32.724 --> 02:10:34.293
THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXCEED

02:10:34.359 --> 02:10:35.694
THE LIMITS OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS

02:10:35.761 --> 02:10:37.362
AN ARE THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND SO

02:10:37.429 --> 02:10:39.598
I JUST AGAIN IT IS LABOR LAW IN

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:41.700
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER

02:10:41.767 --> 02:10:43.669
THE LABOR CODE THAT WE PASS

02:10:43.735 --> 02:10:46.405
THAT REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS ON P.

02:10:46.471 --> 02:10:48.207
ST TO MAKE THE MINIMUM STANDARD

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:49.708
OF MINIMUM WEIGHT. AND THEN

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:51.043
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT IN EXCESS

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:52.477
IS ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN THE

02:10:52.544 --> 02:10:54.513
EMPLOYEE'S POCKET. THE ONLY

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:55.847
THING THAT THIS BILL DOES IS

02:10:55.914 --> 02:11:00.185
REQUIRE ONLY- IN OUR COLLECTIVE

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:01.186
BARGAINING CONTRACTS TO BE ABLE

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:03.822
TO. AND PEACE SO AGAIN I JUST

02:11:03.889 --> 02:11:04.723
NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT'S

02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:09.027
IN CALIFORNIA LAW. AND LIKE I

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:10.062

02:11:10.128 --> 02:11:14.766
TAUGHT. FULLER I DON'T DOUBT.

02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:15.767
THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THOSE.

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:16.835

FOR AWHILE. BUT THE COMPANIES

02:21:28.146 --> 02:21:29.781
FOUND ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING

THEM DOWN AND THAT'S WHY THEY

02:21:53.438 --> 02:21:55.273
GET AWAY WITH IT AND THAT'S WHY

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:56.441
IT'S GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE AND

02:21:56.507 --> 02:21:58.843
WORSE. IT'S A RIGHT TO DO WHAT

02:21:58.910 --> 02:22:00.645

THAT THEY SOLD ONE. TO SAY THIS

02:22:20.365 --> 02:22:21.532
IS WHY WE WORK FOR. CAN YOU

02:22:21.599 --> 02:22:23.034
FIND YOU KNOW THIS IS WHO

PAYING ME MY MINIMUM MIGHT MY

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:29.540

02:22:33.211 --> 02:22:34.812
THAT LIABILITY IN THAT

02:22:34.879 --> 02:22:35.780

BOTTOM AGAIN. YES IT IS THE

02:22:46.024 --> 02:22:48.993
LAW. TO BE PAID MINIMUM WAGE IT

02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:50.662
IS A LOT OF BE PAID OVERTIME.

02:22:50.728 --> 02:22:52.897

02:22:58.436 --> 02:23:00.972
HERE AND THAT'S WHY THE WORKING

02:23:01.039 --> 02:23:04.042

THESE WORKERS TO TELL ME THE

02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:11.215
SAME THING. THIS IS WHAT WITH

02:23:11.282 --> 02:23:12.784

PAID EVEN THE STATE MINIMUM

02:23:17.388 --> 02:23:20.491
WAGE. THERE IS NO ELIMINATION

02:23:20.558 --> 02:23:22.527
OF INCENTIVES IT'S INCLUDED IN

02:23:22.593 --> 02:23:24.796
THIS BILL. THAT THERE ARE WAYS

02:23:24.862 --> 02:23:28.499
FOR AN EMPLOYER TO GET BONUSES

02:23:28.566 --> 02:23:29.767
AND INCENTIVIZE MORE

02:23:29.834 --> 02:23:31.069
PRODUCTIVITY THE THING IS THAT

02:23:31.135 --> 02:23:32.670
THE MINIMUM WAGE AND IT'S ABOVE

02:23:32.737 --> 02:23:36.240
THAT. SO THERE IS STILL WAY. IN

02:23:36.307 --> 02:23:39.143
A AND A AND AN ETHICAL WAY AND

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:42.580

OPTIONS TO PROVIDE REVENUE. BUT

LOCAL ENTITY CAN DECIDE WHAT IS

02:35:37.961 --> 02:35:39.997
THE BEST TO FIT THEIR

SENATOR STERN. AT THANK YOU

02:37:59.970 --> 02:38:02.940
MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK.

02:38:03.006 --> 02:38:05.776
THE DEAN MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM

02:38:05.843 --> 02:38:08.011
TO HEMA FOR HIS EFFORTS HERE

02:38:08.078 --> 02:38:11.548
AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN- LIFE AND

02:38:11.615 --> 02:38:13.951
DEATH CIRCUMSTANCES UP THERE

02:38:14.017 --> 02:38:16.920
&lt;c.cyan&gt;OR TOO LONG- OUR POWER WENT&lt;/c&gt;

02:38:16.987 --> 02:38:19.389
DOWN. HAD SOME OF VERY

02:38:19.456 --> 02:38:20.858
HARROWING EXPERIENCES OURSELVES

02:38:20.924 --> 02:38:22.392
DURING PS PS SO I GET THE

02:38:22.459 --> 02:38:24.862
URGENCY OF THE MEASURE-

02:38:24.928 --> 02:38:27.598
UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T SUPPORT.

02:38:27.664 --> 02:38:32.436
THE BILL TODAY. NOT BECAUSE I

02:38:32.502 --> 02:38:33.270
DON'T BELIEVE THAT DIESEL

02:38:33.337 --> 02:38:35.138
GENERATOR SHOULDN'T BE THERE IS

02:38:35.205 --> 02:38:37.040
A SORT OF LAST RESORT BACK UP

02:38:37.107 --> 02:38:39.409
AND I THINK AS OUR COLLEAGUE

02:38:39.476 --> 02:38:41.478
FROM MARANDA AND NAPA EARLIER

02:38:41.545 --> 02:38:44.181
WE MADE EFFORTS TO ACCOMMODATE

02:38:44.248 --> 02:38:46.116
THAT SORT A LAST RESORT

02:38:46.183 --> 02:38:48.452
EMERGENCY THIS. I RECOGNIZE THE

02:38:48.518 --> 02:38:49.720
DIESEL WILL HAVE TO BE IN THE

02:38:49.786 --> 02:38:51.521
MIX IN SOME WAY. BUT WHEN IT

02:38:51.588 --> 02:38:54.157
COMES USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO

02:38:54.224 --> 02:38:57.694
INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR. AND TO

02:38:57.761 --> 02:38:59.830
PUT PROACTIVE MONEY ON THE

02:38:59.897 --> 02:39:01.732
TABLE I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD

02:39:01.798 --> 02:39:04.434
BE INCENTIVIZING- TECHNOLOGY

02:39:04.501 --> 02:39:06.536
THAT ISN'T GOING TO PUT OUR AIR

02:39:06.603 --> 02:39:08.472
QUALITY A RISK OR BOTTOM LINES

02:39:08.538 --> 02:39:11.842
AT RISK- I APPRECIATE THE

02:39:11.909 --> 02:39:14.011
EFFORT ON TRYING TO MAKE THE

02:39:14.077 --> 02:39:15.379
BILL TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. I

02:39:15.445 --> 02:39:17.014
GUESS I DON'T I'M NOT NEUTRAL

02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:19.549
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE IT

02:39:19.616 --> 02:39:21.151
I THINK THE ONLY INCENTIVES WE

02:39:21.218 --> 02:39:22.352
SHOULD BE PUTTING ON THE LINER

02:39:22.419 --> 02:39:24.554
SAY FOR SOLAR STORAGE SYSTEMS

02:39:24.621 --> 02:39:26.189
ARE FOR FUEL CELL SYSTEMS ARE

02:39:26.256 --> 02:39:26.857
FOR OTHER. CLEAN ENERGY

02:39:26.924 --> 02:39:29.593
TECHNOLOGY IN FACT WE HAVE A

02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:31.461
GREAT PROGRAM NOW TO SEE IF YOU

02:39:31.528 --> 02:39:33.797
SEE THAT ALLOWS THAT AND OUR

02:39:33.864 --> 02:39:36.366
OUR BUT IT JUST ALLOCATE

02:39:36.433 --> 02:39:39.202
ACTUALLY FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR.

02:39:39.269 --> 02:39:41.305
CUT POWER FOR CAN THIS. THERE

02:39:41.371 --> 02:39:41.872
IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:39:41.939 --> 02:39:43.073
CURRENT BUDGET FOR COUNTIES AND

02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:44.574
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THEIR

02:39:44.641 --> 02:39:46.510
OWN BACK UP. UNFORTUNATELY THE

02:39:46.576 --> 02:39:47.711
DEFAULT FOR A LOT OF COUNTIES

02:39:47.778 --> 02:39:49.313
FROM THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

02:39:49.379 --> 02:39:50.714
THAT WE PUT IN LAST YEAR WAS

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:52.749
ALL THESE. IT'S AN EASY THING

02:39:52.816 --> 02:39:54.584
TO DEFAULT TO. I GET THAT IT'S

02:39:54.651 --> 02:39:55.786
HARD TO DO THIS DILIGENCE AND

02:39:55.852 --> 02:39:57.454
TRY TO FIND THESE NEW SOLUTIONS

02:39:57.521 --> 02:39:59.356
BUT- I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD

02:39:59.423 --> 02:40:00.691
BE ENCOURAGING WITH OUR

02:40:00.757 --> 02:40:02.726
TAXPAYER DOLLARS- THE SORT OF

02:40:02.793 --> 02:40:03.961
FUTURE SOLUTIONS THAT TO ME ARE

02:40:04.027 --> 02:40:05.195
HERE RIGHT NOW CLEAN ENERGY

02:40:05.262 --> 02:40:07.931
MICRO GRADES. ENERGY STORAGE OF

SOLAR STORAGE COMBINATIONS THEY

02:40:09.766 --> 02:40:12.970

GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:49.572
RISE TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN FORTY

02:45:49.639 --> 02:45:50.774

UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SB

02:45:59.182 --> 02:45:59.983
ELEVEN FORTY ONE IS CRITICAL

02:46:00.050 --> 02:46:02.185
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW DOMESTIC

02:46:02.252 --> 02:46:03.553
VIOLENCE IS NOT LIMITED TO

02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:08.091
PHYSICAL BRUISES AND ABUSE. IT

02:46:08.158 --> 02:46:09.225
ALSO INVOLVES A PATTERN OF BOB

02:46:09.292 --> 02:46:10.894
CONTROL TO WHICH AN ABUSER

02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:13.163
DOMINATES EVERY ASPECT OF THE

02:46:13.229 --> 02:46:15.365
VICTIMS LINE LIFE CAUSING

02:46:15.432 --> 02:46:17.567
SEVERE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS SOME

02:46:17.634 --> 02:46:19.869
EXAMPLES OF. CHORUS OF CONTROL

02:46:19.936 --> 02:46:22.105
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

02:46:22.172 --> 02:46:24.507
CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE A GRADUAL

02:46:24.574 --> 02:46:26.810
ISOLATION AWAY FROM FAMILY AND

02:46:26.876 --> 02:46:30.046
FRIENDS. WITHHOLDING FINANCES

02:46:30.113 --> 02:46:31.514
AND BASIC NECESSITIES

02:46:31.581 --> 02:46:33.216
NECESSITIES INCLUDING USING

02:46:33.283 --> 02:46:34.851
THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO

02:46:34.918 --> 02:46:36.419
MANIPULATE THE SITUATION AND

02:46:36.486 --> 02:46:39.022
KEEP CONTROL. IT MAKES IT

02:46:39.089 --> 02:46:41.157
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY

02:46:41.224 --> 02:46:43.593
VICTIM TO GET AWAY.

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:45.762
UNFORTUNATELY THIS PANDEMIC HAS

02:46:45.829 --> 02:46:47.397
PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS VERY

02:46:47.464 --> 02:46:50.133
IMPORTANT ISSUE. DATA SHOWS THE

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:51.634
NUMBER OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:46:51.701 --> 02:46:53.470
CALLS TO THE NATIONAL HOTLINE

02:46:53.536 --> 02:46:55.271
ARE DRASTICALLY INCREASING AS

02:46:55.338 --> 02:46:56.373
VICTIMS ARE LOCKED IN WITH

02:46:56.439 --> 02:46:58.975
THEIR ABUSERS. NEARLY TEN

02:46:59.042 --> 02:47:00.210
STATES ACROSS THE US HAVE

02:47:00.276 --> 02:47:01.711
ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE

02:47:01.778 --> 02:47:04.114
IMPORTANCE OF NADINE MAY NEED

02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:05.849
THIS TYPE OF ABUSE IN THEIR

02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:08.118
STATUTES. THIS BILL SIMPLY

02:47:08.184 --> 02:47:09.819
ALLOW THE VICTIM TO BE ABLE TO

02:47:09.886 --> 02:47:12.288
PROVIDE TESTIMONY. BUT I WANT

02:47:12.355 --> 02:47:14.858
TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT A JUDGE

02:47:14.924 --> 02:47:15.358
STILL HAS TO REVIEW THE

02:47:15.425 --> 02:47:17.927
EVIDENCE. AND DETERMINE IF

02:47:17.994 --> 02:47:20.130
THERE IS AN ONGOING PATTERN OF

02:47:20.196 --> 02:47:22.098
ABUSE THAT SATISFIES ALL

02:47:22.165 --> 02:47:24.868
ELEMENTS OF THE LAW. THIS ALSO

02:47:24.934 --> 02:47:26.536
INCLUDES A BUILT IN DEFENSE OF

02:47:26.603 --> 02:47:28.438
REASONABLE NOW SO WHAT THAT

02:47:28.505 --> 02:47:30.440
MEANS IS THAT CONTACT. UNDER

02:47:30.507 --> 02:47:32.142
REASONABLE CIRCUMSTANCES IS

02:47:32.208 --> 02:47:36.579
EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL EXACT.

02:47:38.381 --> 02:47:40.450
REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE IT IS

02:47:40.517 --> 02:47:42.419
TIME THAT WE STRENGTHEN OUR

02:47:42.485 --> 02:47:43.453
LOSS FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC

02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:45.188
VIOLENCE AND ADDRESS THIS

02:47:45.255 --> 02:47:47.390
CRITICAL ISSUE. JUST BECAUSE

02:47:47.457 --> 02:47:48.958
VICTIMS DON'T WALK AROUND WITH

02:47:49.025 --> 02:47:50.794
BRUISES ALL OVER THEIR BODY

02:47:50.860 --> 02:47:52.495
DOES NOT MEAN THEY'RE NOT BEING

02:47:52.562 --> 02:47:54.697

IN MY FORMER CAPACITY IS AN

03:06:44.526 --> 03:06:46.361
EDUCATOR I'VE SEEN THAT THERE

03:06:46.428 --> 03:06:48.497

POINT TIME DURING WORLD WAR TWO

03:07:13.255 --> 03:07:15.023
WAS GIVING OUT CIGARETTES TO G.

03:07:15.090 --> 03:07:17.192
EYES. IT WASN'T BASED ON

03:07:17.259 --> 03:07:18.961
PATRIOTISM IT WAS BASED ON

03:07:19.027 --> 03:07:21.830
CREATING- A LOYALTY TO THE

03:07:21.897 --> 03:07:24.366
BRAND IN THE USERS. THE JOINT I

03:07:24.433 --> 03:07:27.369
KNOW IT'S THERE. MY QUESTION IS

03:07:27.436 --> 03:07:29.471
THIS SUFFICIENTLY TAYLOR SO

03:07:29.538 --> 03:07:30.939
LIKE. IF I COMPOSE A COUPLE OF

03:07:31.006 --> 03:07:33.742
QUESTIONS- TO YOU THROUGH THE

CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR. WITHOUT

03:07:35.811 --> 03:07:41.049
OBJECTION. SO I UNDERSTAND THIS

03:07:41.116 --> 03:07:43.452
DOES NOT THIS THIS BILL DOES

03:07:43.518 --> 03:07:46.121
NOT COVER ADVERTISING IT IS NOT

03:07:46.188 --> 03:07:49.257
TAILORED TO MECHANIZED

03:07:49.324 --> 03:07:53.495
CIGARETTES. IT INCLUDES CHEWING

03:07:53.562 --> 03:07:57.899

03:07:57.966 --> 03:08:01.937
HAVE. I SUPPOSE SNUFFY PEOPLE

03:08:02.004 --> 03:08:05.107
EVEN USE NOTHING MORE. BUT MY

03:08:05.173 --> 03:08:08.543
QUESTION TO YOU IS HOW WAS IT

03:08:08.610 --> 03:08:10.012
DIFFERENT HOW IS THIS NOT. THE

03:08:10.078 --> 03:08:12.814
RIVER IS COULD YOU IMAGINE THIS

03:08:12.881 --> 03:08:15.851
BEING MORE TAILORED NARROWLY TO

03:08:15.917 --> 03:08:18.587
GO AFTER THE MOST UNIQUE IN

03:08:18.654 --> 03:08:21.456
VULNERABLE- SEGMENTS OF THE

03:08:21.523 --> 03:08:22.391
POPULATION WHILE STILL

03:08:22.457 --> 03:08:24.292
PRESERVING THE RIGHTS OF FREE

03:08:24.359 --> 03:08:27.929
CHOICE. AND THANK YOU FOR THE

03:08:27.996 --> 03:08:29.531
QUESTION I THINK THIS IS

03:08:29.598 --> 03:08:31.867
TAILORED BECAUSE ITS GOAL IS TO

03:08:31.933 --> 03:08:34.269
ELIMINATE ALL FLAVORS AND AS I

03:08:34.336 --> 03:08:36.705
MENTIONED 80% OF ALL THE NEW

03:08:36.772 --> 03:08:38.940
YOUNG SMOKERS FOR PAPERS OR

03:08:39.007 --> 03:08:41.109
WHATEVER PRODUCT. USE A

03:08:41.176 --> 03:08:43.645
FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS SO

03:08:43.712 --> 03:08:44.846
IT'S THE HARSHNESS OF THE

03:08:44.913 --> 03:08:47.015
TOBACCO IN THE CASE THAT WHEN I

03:08:47.082 --> 03:08:48.417
TOOK MY FIRST HIT OF A

03:08:48.483 --> 03:08:49.785
CIGARETTE I THINK IT WAS

03:08:49.851 --> 03:08:52.521
THIRTEEN AT THE TIME THAT WAS

03:08:52.587 --> 03:08:53.155
THE LAST ONE. BECAUSE IT TASTED

03:08:53.221 --> 03:08:56.058
LIKE. OKAY FRANKLY. AND I

03:08:56.124 --> 03:08:57.426
WASN'T INTERESTED IN ANYTHING

03:08:57.492 --> 03:08:58.760
BEYOND THAT AND WHEN YOU LOOK

03:08:58.827 --> 03:09:00.629
AT OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE A CIGAR.

03:09:00.696 --> 03:09:02.297
WE FIND IT INTERESTING THAT

03:09:02.364 --> 03:09:03.532
WHICH I THINK IS AN INTERESTING

03:09:03.598 --> 03:09:06.601
NUMBER THAT. YOUTH THE SECOND

03:09:06.668 --> 03:09:09.304
HIGHEST USE OF A NUMBER OF

03:09:09.371 --> 03:09:09.938
SMOKERS AFFECT THE HEAD OF THE

03:09:10.005 --> 03:09:15.510
NUMBER HERE. IS CIGAR SMOKING

03:09:15.577 --> 03:09:20.015
BY YOU IS THE SECOND HIGHEST I

03:09:20.082 --> 03:09:21.483
MEAN THAT IS THEIR SECOND CALL

03:09:21.550 --> 03:09:23.819
BACK IS SMOKING FLAVORED

03:09:23.885 --> 03:09:27.222
TOBACCO CIGAR BUT SOME TIME TO

03:09:27.289 --> 03:09:29.624
THE ID IS THE FLAVOR NOT THE

03:09:29.691 --> 03:09:32.360
DEVICE THAT IS ATTRACTING THE

03:09:32.427 --> 03:09:33.929
YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE NICOTINE

03:09:33.995 --> 03:09:36.198
AND THEN ONCE THEY GET ADDICTED

03:09:36.264 --> 03:09:38.333
TO THAT NICOTINE- THEY STILL

03:09:38.400 --> 03:09:40.402
WANT INCREASE FLAVOR BUT THEN

03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:41.770
THEY WILL DEFAULT TO WHATEVER

03:09:41.837 --> 03:09:43.872
PROVIDES THAT NICOTINE FIX IN

03:09:43.939 --> 03:09:45.640
THE FUTURE. ALRIGHT I WON'T

03:09:45.707 --> 03:09:48.844
BELABOR THIS MUCH FURTHER- THIS

03:09:48.910 --> 03:09:52.280
IS A FINANCIAL- IS ISSUED BY

03:09:52.347 --> 03:09:52.981
PHONE OR IN YOUR OWN TIME

03:09:53.048 --> 03:09:55.016
SENATOR THIS WILL BE MY LOOK I

03:09:55.083 --> 03:09:57.018
STILL SECOND MY LAST QUESTION

03:09:57.085 --> 03:09:57.552
FOR YOU ACCEPT THE SECOND

03:09:57.619 --> 03:10:00.756
QUESTION CENTER HILL YES IS

03:10:00.822 --> 03:10:02.090
THAT HE CERTAIN CERTAIN FUNDING

03:10:02.157 --> 03:10:03.658
SOURCES THAT MAKE THEIR WAY.

03:10:03.725 --> 03:10:06.394
ROAD OR OTHER SERVICES THAT WE

03:10:06.461 --> 03:10:08.997
HAVE IN QUE KEPT THE COUNTY

03:10:09.064 --> 03:10:13.068
LEVEL MYBE THROUGH THE STATE-

03:10:13.135 --> 03:10:14.402
HAVE WE DEVISED A WAY TO BACK

03:10:14.469 --> 03:10:16.338
FILL THE DOLLARS THAT WILL

03:10:16.404 --> 03:10:18.106
LIKELY BE LOS BASED ON THE

03:10:18.173 --> 03:10:20.208
REDUCED. REVENUE BROUGHT ABOUT

03:10:20.275 --> 03:10:24.012
BY. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

03:10:24.079 --> 03:10:25.380
BECAUSE WE EXPECT TO BETTER USE

03:10:25.447 --> 03:10:27.082
WILL PROBABLY DECREASE SOME

03:10:27.149 --> 03:10:29.684
BECAUSE OF IT. AND I KNOW FOR

03:10:29.751 --> 03:10:31.153
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FRESNO COUNTY

03:10:31.219 --> 03:10:32.888
HAD A MEASURES SEVEN WAS A

03:10:32.954 --> 03:10:34.923
MAJOR SEE BACK IN THE DAY WHICH

03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:36.992
WENT TO- HIGHWAY WIDENING AND

03:10:37.058 --> 03:10:38.560
STUFF LIKE THAT BASED ON

03:10:38.627 --> 03:10:39.494
TOBACCO USAGE IF I REMEMBER

03:10:39.561 --> 03:10:41.229
CORRECTLY. DO WE HAVE A BACK

03:10:41.296 --> 03:10:43.765
FILL OF THE PROJECTED LOSS. TO

03:10:43.832 --> 03:10:45.433
PASS THAT IS THANK YOU FOR THE

03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:48.003
QUESTION- THERE ARE THERE ARE

03:10:48.069 --> 03:10:51.406
TWO PATHS THERE ONE IS- IT

03:10:51.473 --> 03:10:53.175
FRANKLY AS I LOOK AT IT THERE

03:10:53.241 --> 03:10:55.877
IS NO PRICE THAT WE SHOULD BE.

03:10:55.944 --> 03:10:57.546
PAYING NOR A PRICE THAT WE

03:10:57.612 --> 03:10:58.947
SHOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE TO BACK

03:10:59.014 --> 03:11:01.650
FILL OR PROVIDE IF WE IF THIS

03:11:01.716 --> 03:11:03.985
IS MONEY THAT. IS NOT SPENT

03:11:04.052 --> 03:11:05.887
THEIR OWN LIVES SAVED IN THAT

03:11:05.954 --> 03:11:08.056
THE ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW FROM A

03:11:08.123 --> 03:11:09.257
SOME VERY VALID SOURCES THAT

03:11:09.324 --> 03:11:11.426
THEY WOULD SAVE AT LEAST

03:11:11.493 --> 03:11:12.227
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND LIVES IN

03:11:12.294 --> 03:11:13.328
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

03:11:13.395 --> 03:11:14.796
IN HEALTHCARE COSTS. BECAUSE

03:11:14.863 --> 03:11:16.765
THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE SUFFERING

03:11:16.832 --> 03:11:18.200
WILL NOT HAVE IT BUT TO ME IT'S

03:11:18.266 --> 03:11:19.634
DOLLARS JUST AS WE DO IT DEALT

03:11:19.701 --> 03:11:21.503
WITH COVERT NINETEEN IN THE

03:11:21.570 --> 03:11:23.505
PROBLEMS THERE WE WERE WILLING.

03:11:23.572 --> 03:11:25.774
TO SAVE A LIFE TO GIVE UP A

03:11:25.841 --> 03:11:29.477
LARGE PORTION OF THE ECONOMY OF

03:11:29.544 --> 03:11:30.078
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE

03:11:30.145 --> 03:11:31.313
PRICE WE PAY IN ORDER TO SAVE

03:11:31.379 --> 03:11:33.048
LIVES. AND I THINK THERE'S NO

03:11:33.114 --> 03:11:35.483
PRICE. THAT WE SHOULD PAY IN

03:11:35.550 --> 03:11:39.321
ORDER HERE OR- ASSUME THAT WE-

03:11:39.387 --> 03:11:41.323
A WILL LOSE TO SAVE THE LIVES

03:11:41.389 --> 03:11:43.091
OF THE NEXT GENERATION AND THAT

03:11:43.158 --> 03:11:44.626
NEXT GENERATION BECAUSE IT WILL

03:11:44.693 --> 03:11:46.661
CONTINUE AFTER THAT SO. THAT

03:11:46.728 --> 03:11:48.330
THAT WOULD BE MY- MY ANSWER TO

03:11:48.396 --> 03:11:49.631
THAT TO THAT QUESTION IS THAT

03:11:49.698 --> 03:11:51.867
THERE'S A THERE'S NO. NO DOLLAR

03:11:51.933 --> 03:11:54.736
AMOUNT AND- SECONDLY THAT THE

03:11:54.803 --> 03:11:56.638
HEALTH CARE COST SAVINGS. WILL

03:11:56.705 --> 03:11:58.740
EQUAL THAT AMOUNT AT LEAST

03:11:58.807 --> 03:12:01.009

FOR OUR YOUTH THIS NICOTINE

03:12:41.783 --> 03:12:44.819
ADDICTION- IT'S INSIDIOUS IT'S

03:12:44.886 --> 03:12:45.954
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS AND

03:12:46.021 --> 03:12:48.456
ADDICTIVE. AND THIS LEGISLATION

03:12:48.523 --> 03:12:49.324

BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW

03:13:04.906 --> 03:13:06.908
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- WE'VE

03:13:06.975 --> 03:13:08.310
HAD DISCUSSIONS ON AND I

03:13:08.376 --> 03:13:09.678
PERSONALLY BEEN WORKING ON IT

03:13:09.744 --> 03:13:11.713
AND BEEN VERY VOCAL ON THIS- I

03:13:11.780 --> 03:13:14.282
AM ALARMED EVERY TIME I SPEAK

03:13:14.349 --> 03:13:16.151
TO SOME OF MY FELLOW TEACHERS

03:13:16.217 --> 03:13:18.420
AT THE CREATIVE NEW WAYS THAT

03:13:18.486 --> 03:13:20.088
MANUFACTURERS MANAGED TO GET

03:13:20.155 --> 03:13:23.158
VAPING DEVICES INTO THE HANDS

03:13:23.224 --> 03:13:25.060
OF OUR CHILDREN. I THE

03:13:25.126 --> 03:13:26.661
CREATIVITY IN TERMS OF

PRODUCING SCHOOL SUPPLIES THAT

03:13:29.731 --> 03:13:32.567
LOOK LIKE SCHOOL SUPPLIES BUT

03:13:32.634 --> 03:13:34.336
THEY'RE ACTUALLY VAPING DEVICES

03:13:34.402 --> 03:13:36.171
IS ASTONISHING TO ME FROM AND I

03:13:36.237 --> 03:13:39.374
FROM STAPLERS TWO PENCILS TO

03:13:39.441 --> 03:13:41.476
EVEN SURE IT'S AND SO I THINK

03:13:41.543 --> 03:13:43.712
EVEN THOUGH THIS DOESN'T TACKLE

03:13:43.778 --> 03:13:45.914
THE MANUFACTURER BEING OF THE

03:13:45.981 --> 03:13:48.316
DEVICES JUST ELIMINATING THE

03:13:48.383 --> 03:13:50.785
BABY IN FLAVOR SO ALONE I FEEL

03:13:50.852 --> 03:13:53.088
IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO STOPPING

03:13:53.154 --> 03:13:55.657
THIS EPIDEMIC US- OUR COLLEAGUE

03:13:55.724 --> 03:13:58.927
JUST MENTIONED IN THE LAST TWO

03:13:58.994 --> 03:14:01.496
YEARS THREE MILLION. THREE AND

03:14:01.563 --> 03:14:05.100
MORE OF A YOU ARE EIGHTEEN THIS

03:14:05.166 --> 03:14:05.967

TO A TO AT THE GOD FROM SAN

03:14:19.080 --> 03:14:20.949
MATTEO FOR LEADING- ON THIS

03:14:21.016 --> 03:14:22.717
BILL AND PROUD TO ALSO BE A

03:14:22.784 --> 03:14:24.452
JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS BILL THAT

03:14:24.519 --> 03:14:26.287
IS- MY GOOD FRIEND FROM

03:14:26.354 --> 03:14:28.823
HORRENDOUS SAID- THAT THIS IS

03:14:28.890 --> 03:14:30.258
REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO PROTECT

03:14:30.325 --> 03:14:33.094
OUR USE FROM BEING ADDICTED TO

03:14:33.161 --> 03:14:34.963
NICOTINE. AS A GATEWAY DRUG WE

03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:36.598
KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO START

03:14:36.664 --> 03:14:38.400
VAPING ARE MORE LIKELY TO

03:14:38.466 --> 03:14:39.868
EXCUSE COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES.

03:14:39.934 --> 03:14:41.569
AND WHILE SOME OF THE OPPONENTS

03:14:41.636 --> 03:14:43.605
MAY SAY THAT VAPING IS QUOTE

03:14:43.671 --> 03:14:45.940
SAFER. THAN CIGARETTES IT STILL

03:14:46.007 --> 03:14:47.809
DOESN'T MAKE IT SAFE IT'S

03:14:47.876 --> 03:14:50.945
DANGEROUS. AND WE DON'T WANT

03:14:51.012 --> 03:14:52.981
OUR USE HOPE TO NICOTINE AND WE

03:14:53.048 --> 03:14:54.783
HAVE. TREMENDOUS EVIDENCE TO

03:14:54.849 --> 03:14:56.751
SHOW THAT THAT IS WHAT'S

03:14:56.818 --> 03:14:58.820
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IN THAT

03:14:58.887 --> 03:14:59.921
AND THEY'RE BEING ATTRACTED

03:14:59.988 --> 03:15:02.023
BECAUSE OF THE FLAVORS. THAT'S

03:15:02.090 --> 03:15:04.192
WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS SO THIS

03:15:04.259 --> 03:15:06.361
BILL IS A NARROWLY TARGETED

03:15:06.428 --> 03:15:09.130
BUILD TOWARD THAT VERY POINTS

03:15:09.197 --> 03:15:11.232
THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO USE TO

03:15:11.299 --> 03:15:14.302
START. USING A DEVICE THAT WILL

03:15:14.369 --> 03:15:16.438
GET THEM HOOKED ON NICOTINE.

03:15:16.504 --> 03:15:18.807
PROBABLY FOR DECADES. BECAUSE

03:15:18.873 --> 03:15:20.842
IT'S VERY HARD TO STOP. IN FACT

03:15:20.909 --> 03:15:22.410
ACTUALLY PHYSICIANS ARE

03:15:22.477 --> 03:15:25.346
STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO WEAN.

03:15:25.413 --> 03:15:27.816
YOU OFF THESE DEVICES- BECAUSE

03:15:27.882 --> 03:15:29.717
OFTENTIMES IN NICOTINE DOSES IN

03:15:29.784 --> 03:15:31.052
THESE DEVICES ARE MUCH HIGHER

03:15:31.119 --> 03:15:32.587
THAN THEY CAN EVEN GET AND

03:15:32.654 --> 03:15:34.222
COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTE. THE

03:15:34.289 --> 03:15:35.657
OTHER THING I WOULD DO ONE OF

03:15:35.723 --> 03:15:37.826
ALSO TOUCH ON IS THERE IS A

03:15:37.892 --> 03:15:40.095
QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED ABOUT.

03:15:40.161 --> 03:15:42.831
BACK FILLING COSTS I WILL POINT

03:15:42.897 --> 03:15:45.934
OUT THAT THE COST. OF THE

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:47.969
HEALTH CARE RELATED TO PEOPLE

03:15:48.036 --> 03:15:49.838
WHO START VAPING AND THEN

03:15:49.904 --> 03:15:51.106
PERHAPS MOVE ONTO COMBUSTIBLE

03:15:51.172 --> 03:15:54.542
CIGARETTES. IS CERTAINLY A MUCH

03:15:54.609 --> 03:15:56.744
GREATER BURDEN ON OUR STATE WE

03:15:56.811 --> 03:15:59.180
HAVE A MEDI CAL PROGRAM- THAT-

03:15:59.247 --> 03:16:00.381
PAYS FOR A THIRD OF ALL

03:16:00.448 --> 03:16:02.250
CALIFORNIANS WE ALSO HAVE-

03:16:02.317 --> 03:16:04.052
WORKERS WHO WE COVER ALSO

03:16:04.119 --> 03:16:05.753
LOCALITIES HAVE THAT AS WELL.

03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:07.422
IT'S CERTAINLY MUCH GREATER

03:16:07.489 --> 03:16:08.823
THAN WHAT WE WOULD COLLECT IN

03:16:08.890 --> 03:16:10.058
TAXES IN FACT THIS IS AN

03:16:10.125 --> 03:16:11.926
ARGUMENT USED AGAINST PROP

03:16:11.993 --> 03:16:12.727
FIFTY SIX WELL WAS NOT FOCUS

03:16:12.794 --> 03:16:14.262
JUST ON BEEPING ON GENERAL

03:16:14.329 --> 03:16:15.296
SOMEONE CIVIL WHAT HAPPENS OUR

03:16:15.363 --> 03:16:16.664
ONE STOP SMOKING AND I SAID YOU

03:16:16.731 --> 03:16:17.532
KNOW WHAT WE WOULD SAVE A LOT

03:16:17.599 --> 03:16:18.766
MORE MONEY THAN ANY MONEY WE

03:16:18.833 --> 03:16:19.767
WOULD GATHER FROM THIS BACK

03:16:19.834 --> 03:16:21.302
ATTACKS AND THEY'LL BE EXACTLY

03:16:21.369 --> 03:16:22.770
WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN.

03:16:22.837 --> 03:16:25.473
AND SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT EVEN

03:16:25.540 --> 03:16:26.274
FROM A STRICTLY FINANCIAL

03:16:26.341 --> 03:16:28.376
STANDPOINT THIS BILL MAKES A

03:16:28.443 --> 03:16:29.410
LOT OF SENSE BUT I CERTAINLY

03:16:29.477 --> 03:16:30.778
HOPE WE WILL VOTE FOR THIS BILL

03:16:30.845 --> 03:16:32.580
NOT BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE OF THE

03:16:32.647 --> 03:16:34.782
FINANCIAL BENEFITS BUT BECAUSE-

03:16:34.849 --> 03:16:36.951
OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS

03:16:37.018 --> 03:16:38.019
AND CERTAINLY THE MORE BENEFITS

03:16:38.086 --> 03:16:39.721
WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE OUR USE.

03:16:39.787 --> 03:16:42.123
ADDICTED TO NICOTINE I

03:16:42.190 --> 03:16:43.124
ORGANIZED A THANK YOU. THANK

MILITARY AND SO YOU KNOW THIS

03:17:09.350 --> 03:17:10.852
IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE FOR ME OF AN

03:17:10.919 --> 03:17:13.688
INDUSTRY THAT PREYS ON UNDER

03:17:13.755 --> 03:17:15.056
REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES

03:17:15.123 --> 03:17:17.358
ACCORDING TO A NATIONAL STUDY

03:17:17.425 --> 03:17:17.926
SEVEN OUT OF TEN BLACK YOUTH

03:17:17.992 --> 03:17:20.361

NATION WIDE CENSUS TRACKS WITH

03:17:24.566 --> 03:17:25.867
A GREATER PROPORTION OF BLACK

03:17:25.934 --> 03:17:27.402
RESIDENTS HAVE HIGHER TOBACCO

03:17:27.468 --> 03:17:29.804
RETAILER DENSITY AND SO THIS IS

03:17:29.871 --> 03:17:31.372
YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE THE NET THE

03:17:31.439 --> 03:17:33.208
NEXT ITERATION FOR THIS

03:17:33.274 --> 03:17:35.810
INDUSTRY- ARE THESE NEW

CONTINUE TO ONCE AGAIN PREY ON

03:17:40.215 --> 03:17:41.516
UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES

03:17:41.583 --> 03:17:43.651
WHEN I LOOK AT. THE DANCER

03:17:43.718 --> 03:17:45.820

OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO BEEN

03:18:00.134 --> 03:18:02.270
IMPACTED BY THAT VIRUS THAT

03:18:02.337 --> 03:18:05.373
ATTACKS THE LUNGS. TO HAVE PRE

03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:07.175
EXISTING LONG VULNERABILITY AS

03:18:07.242 --> 03:18:09.110
A RESULT OF LONG TERM SMOKING

03:18:09.177 --> 03:18:11.446
ONLY EXACERBATES THAT AND SO IS

03:18:11.512 --> 03:18:12.447
AN INDUSTRY THAT'S PREYED ON MY

03:18:12.513 --> 03:18:14.649
COMMUNITY AND I WILL CONTINUE

03:18:14.716 --> 03:18:17.552

INDUSTRY THAT IS CLEARLY WHERE

03:18:41.843 --> 03:18:43.611
THEY HAVE TARGETED FOR THE LAST

03:18:43.678 --> 03:18:45.413
TEN YEARS. ONE OF MY FIRST

03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:46.948
BILLS WHEN I GOT TO THE

03:18:47.015 --> 03:18:49.117
LEGISLATURE ELEVEN YEARS AGO

03:18:49.183 --> 03:18:50.918
WAS THE BANNING OF FLAVORED

03:18:50.985 --> 03:18:53.221
BLUNT WRAPS AND I WASN'T ABLE

03:18:53.288 --> 03:18:54.155
TO GET THAT OUT OF

03:18:54.222 --> 03:18:56.157
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I

03:18:56.224 --> 03:18:58.526
ARGUED STRONGLY THAT THIS WAS

03:18:58.593 --> 03:19:00.161
TARGETING OUR YOUTH AND ELEVEN

03:19:00.228 --> 03:19:02.330
YEARS WE'VE CLEARLY SEEN THE

03:19:02.397 --> 03:19:04.432
EXPANSION OF THAT MARKING TO.

03:19:04.499 --> 03:19:06.934
OUR YOUTH I STAND HERE AS AN

03:19:07.001 --> 03:19:07.802
INDIVIDUAL WHO LOST. THIR

TWENTY FIVE YEARS THIS NOVEMBER.

03:19:24.018 --> 03:19:26.387
BUT I DO HAVE A CONCERN. AS IT

03:19:26.454 --> 03:19:29.223
RELATES TO MENTAL BECAUSE WE

03:19:29.290 --> 03:19:30.792
SAW WHAT HAPPENED AIR GARDNER

GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT

03:21:00.448 --> 03:21:02.717

AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT HARMING

03:22:10.284 --> 03:22:12.987

FLAVORED PRODUCTS INTO THE

ILLEGAL FOR STORES TO SELL TO

03:22:43.651 --> 03:22:45.620

BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

03:23:03.004 --> 03:23:04.772
WHY RETAILER SHOULD BE-

03:23:04.839 --> 03:23:07.441
IMPACTED IN AND THIS BILL WOULD

03:23:07.508 --> 03:23:09.343

TRANSACTIONS HOW WOULD YOU KNOW

03:23:23.090 --> 03:23:24.659
THAT IT WASN'T A MINOR. AND WHY

03:23:24.725 --> 03:23:26.427

03:44:34.327 --> 03:44:35.128
FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE

03:44:35.195 --> 03:44:37.363

TO DO WITH A HOUSING CRISIS

03:44:50.276 --> 03:44:51.678
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

03:44:51.744 --> 03:44:52.912

IS A HUGE ELEMENT THAT IS FINDS

03:45:03.323 --> 03:45:03.957
ITSELF WITHIN THE

03:45:04.023 --> 03:45:06.392
JURISPRUDENTIAL CONVERSATION

03:45:06.459 --> 03:45:07.427

PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

03:45:13.967 --> 03:45:15.501
SEEN THIS IN SO MANY

03:45:15.568 --> 03:45:16.870
COMMUNITIES REPRESENTED BY

03:45:16.936 --> 03:45:19.005
SENATORS ACROSS THIS FLOOR

03:45:19.072 --> 03:45:20.306
WHERE THINGS ARE BURNING DOWN

03:45:20.373 --> 03:45:20.907
THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE

03:45:20.974 --> 03:45:23.009
THE CLIMATE CHANGE SO WHAT HAS

03:45:23.076 --> 03:45:24.143
HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THIS

03:45:24.210 --> 03:45:26.446
MEASURE IS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO

03:45:26.512 --> 03:45:27.981
FUND THOSE FIRE DISTRICTS THAT

03:45:28.047 --> 03:45:29.215
HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATELY

03:45:29.282 --> 03:45:31.651
TREATED BECAUSE THE POST PROP

03:45:31.718 --> 03:45:32.819
THIRTEEN OR THEY HAVE EVEN HALF

03:45:32.886 --> 03:45:34.487
PROBLEMS OR THE LIKE AND WHAT

03:45:34.554 --> 03:45:36.689
WE'VE DONE IS TO CREATE THIS

03:45:36.756 --> 03:45:38.658
MEASURE WHAT THE AUTHOR AND

03:45:38.725 --> 03:45:40.193
MISTER HILL HAVE DONE AND

03:45:40.260 --> 03:45:41.961
MISTER MULLIN. TOGETHER WITH

03:45:42.028 --> 03:45:43.963
THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS HOUSE IN

03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:45.632
THE BRILLIANT STAFF OF THE

03:45:45.698 --> 03:45:47.734
PROTEST MOVE WORKED THEIR

03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:49.702
HEARTS OUT ON THIS THING. IS TO

03:45:49.769 --> 03:45:52.238
FIGURE OUT. HOW TO DEAL WITH

03:45:52.305 --> 03:45:53.273
THIS ISSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:45:53.339 --> 03:45:54.407

STREAMS FOR THOSE FIREFIGHTERS

03:45:56.342 --> 03:45:56.709
AND THAT'S JUST NOT

03:45:56.776 --> 03:45:58.111
PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS.

03:45:58.177 --> 03:45:59.512

PROFESSIONAL WISE ENOUGH AND-

03:46:03.549 --> 03:46:05.184
OFFER SUPPORT FOR THEM. SO

03:46:05.251 --> 03:46:07.353
WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT. FOR

03:46:07.420 --> 03:46:08.421
THE OR THIRD OR FOURTH AMEND

03:46:08.488 --> 03:46:09.956
LOST MY COUNT HERE BUT THE

03:46:10.023 --> 03:46:12.458
POINT IS. THAT THE POINT IS

03:46:12.525 --> 03:46:14.427
THAT WE ALSO HAVE THIS PUBLIC

03:46:14.494 --> 03:46:15.495
SAFETY ISSUE WHAT'S THE

03:46:15.561 --> 03:46:17.030
DEFINITION OF PUBLIC SAFETY

03:46:17.096 --> 03:46:17.997
WHAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE WE'RE

03:46:18.064 --> 03:46:20.066
TRYING TO. RE EXAMINE THAT

03:46:20.133 --> 03:46:24.003
ISSUE HERE. ON THIS FLOOR IN IN

03:46:24.070 --> 03:46:26.539
THIS LEGISLATURE. FIREFIGHTERS

03:46:26.606 --> 03:46:27.874
ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF

03:46:27.941 --> 03:46:29.809
THAT PUBLIC SAFETY DELIVERY.

03:46:29.876 --> 03:46:30.810
NOT JUST ON THE HEALTH STUFF

03:46:30.877 --> 03:46:32.578
BUT WE SEE IN THE DEBATES WITH

03:46:32.645 --> 03:46:35.014
RESPECT TO THE ISSUE. OF PARA

03:46:35.081 --> 03:46:37.183
MEDICINE ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT

03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:38.518
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE INVOLVED

03:46:38.584 --> 03:46:40.019
IN BRINGING FOLKS TO MENTAL

03:46:40.086 --> 03:46:41.921
HEALTH FACILITIES ARE FOLKS

03:46:41.988 --> 03:46:43.222
THAT ARE AFFECTED BY. DRUG

03:46:43.289 --> 03:46:44.991
ADDICTION ALL OF WHICH ARE PART

03:46:45.058 --> 03:46:47.593
OF THE- ARCHITECTURE OF PUBLIC

03:46:47.660 --> 03:46:49.395
SAFETY SO WE'RE DEALING WITH

03:46:49.462 --> 03:46:49.963
PUBLIC SAFETY WE'RE DEALING

03:46:50.029 --> 03:46:51.664
WITH HOUSING. WE'RE DEALING

03:46:51.731 --> 03:46:54.300
WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IT IN IN

03:46:54.367 --> 03:46:57.704
THIS MEASURE. AND IT'S IS I

03:46:57.770 --> 03:47:00.173
WOULD SUGGEST. QUITE IMPORTANT

03:47:00.239 --> 03:47:01.641
BECAUSE THERE ARE IS A

03:47:01.708 --> 03:47:03.176
COMPETING MEASURE ON THE BALLOT

03:47:03.242 --> 03:47:11.684
TODAY. TODAY ARM AND THE IDEA.

03:47:11.751 --> 03:47:13.853

INTERCONNECTION OF CRATES A

03:47:18.992 --> 03:47:20.326
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND PROPONENTS

03:47:22.795 --> 03:47:25.231
OF BILLS THE IDEA IS THAT THERE

03:47:25.298 --> 03:47:26.632
SHOULD BE A DISCUSSION AND

03:47:26.699 --> 03:47:30.069
NEGOTIATION OFTEN WHERE WE DEAL

03:47:30.136 --> 03:47:30.837

03:52:41.247 --> 03:52:43.883
HAVE THE SAME FEAR. AT THE SAME

03:52:43.949 --> 03:52:47.853
THIS LOOMING OUT THERE. BUT HOW

03:52:47.920 --> 03:52:50.222
MANY OF THEIR CHILDREN ARE

03:52:50.289 --> 03:52:52.325
GOING TO LIVE ON THAT HOUSE AND

03:52:52.391 --> 03:52:55.361
STAY ON THAT FARM. SADLY TODAY

03:52:55.428 --> 03:52:56.829
FOR MANY REASONS AT ALL NOT

03:52:56.896 --> 03:52:58.597
EVEN THE LABOR WITH YOU. THAT

03:52:58.664 --> 03:53:01.500
IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN. SO WE DO

03:53:01.567 --> 03:53:05.705
HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT LET'S JUST

03:53:05.771 --> 03:53:07.173
CONSIDER WHAT IS REALLY HERE

03:53:07.239 --> 03:53:09.208
THIS IS ABOUT MORE MONEY FOR

03:53:09.275 --> 03:53:13.713
GOVERNMENT TO SPEND. DO THEY

03:53:13.779 --> 03:53:14.947
HAVE OTHER RESOURCES WELL HECK

03:53:15.014 --> 03:53:16.716
YEAH THERE'S SOME MONEY IN THIS

03:53:16.782 --> 03:53:19.218
VERY BUDGET. AND I COMPLEMENT

03:53:19.285 --> 03:53:19.785
THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING IT

03:53:19.852 --> 03:53:22.488
THERE. THE RECOMPENSE LOCAL

03:53:22.555 --> 03:53:26.292
GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:53:26.359 --> 03:53:26.859
PARTICULARLY COUNTIES LADIES

03:53:26.926 --> 03:53:29.362

03:53:29.428 --> 03:53:31.097
STATE KEEP IT SHORT WITH ONE

03:53:31.163 --> 03:53:33.766
EXCEPTION. TRIAL COURT FUNDING

03:53:33.833 --> 03:53:35.835
THE STATE OVER DECADES DID KEEP

03:53:35.901 --> 03:53:38.704
ITS WORD. ON RECOMPENSE IN THEM

03:53:38.771 --> 03:53:40.639
THE LOST TRIAL COURT FUNDING

03:53:40.706 --> 03:53:43.776
EVERYTHING ELSE NO. THIS

03:53:43.843 --> 03:53:46.178
RENEGES. THIS IS A FALSE HOPE A

03:53:46.245 --> 03:53:49.448
FALSE PROMISES A POLITICAL. THE

03:53:49.515 --> 03:53:50.883
HEAD OFTEN INITIATIVE THAT IS

03:53:50.950 --> 03:53:53.753
QUALIFIED AND AS FAR AS THE

03:53:53.819 --> 03:53:55.521
BORDER THAT REALTORS HAVE C. A.

03:53:55.588 --> 03:53:58.391
R. I THINK THEY SHOULD TALK TO

03:53:58.457 --> 03:54:00.159
SOME OF THEIR MEMBERS. THERE

03:54:00.226 --> 03:54:01.293
LISTENING I GUESS TO THEIR

03:54:01.360 --> 03:54:03.429
LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AND THE

EMINENT WISDOM OF PEOPLE WHO

03:54:04.797 --> 03:54:07.032

BEEN AROUND THE COUNTIES THAT I

03:54:08.801 --> 03:54:09.935

WITH MY COLLEAGUE- FROM THE

03:54:28.754 --> 03:54:31.590
VALLEY AND CERTAINLY THE HARD

03:54:31.657 --> 03:54:33.159
WORK OF OUR GOOD FRIEND THE

03:54:33.225 --> 03:54:34.293
SENATOR FROM SAN FERNANDO

03:54:34.360 --> 03:54:36.896
VALLEY IN CRAFTING AND WORKING

03:54:36.962 --> 03:54:39.064
THROUGH THIS THIS ACA. THE

03:54:39.131 --> 03:54:42.735
INTENT OF MY SCA THREE EARLIER

03:54:42.802 --> 03:54:45.371
LAST YEAR WAS TO KIND OF CLOSE

03:54:45.438 --> 03:54:48.474
A LOOPHOLE AND EVEN JOHN TO

03:54:48.541 --> 03:54:50.409
PAUL FROM OF I REMEMBER

03:54:50.476 --> 03:54:52.178
CORRECTLY WHEN I INTRODUCED

03:54:52.244 --> 03:54:55.881
THIS THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE HE

03:54:55.948 --> 03:54:57.817
SAID UP THINK THE WORDS WERE

03:54:57.883 --> 03:54:59.752
THAT MAKES SENSE SOMETHING TO

03:54:59.819 --> 03:55:01.454
THAT EFFECT BECAUSE THAT WASN'T

03:55:01.520 --> 03:55:03.122
THE INTENT OF PROP THIRTEEN TO

03:55:03.189 --> 03:55:04.523
ALLOW SOMEONE TO INHERIT THE

03:55:04.590 --> 03:55:06.492
FRONT THE GOAL WAS IF YOU'RE A

03:55:06.559 --> 03:55:07.893
PARENT PERHAPS LIVING IN THAT

03:55:07.960 --> 03:55:09.228
HOME A CHILD LIVING IN THAT

03:55:09.295 --> 03:55:11.130
HOME FROM YOUR PARENTS OR YOUR

03:55:11.197 --> 03:55:12.932
GOING TO INHERIT THAT HOME AT

03:55:12.998 --> 03:55:14.533
THEIR DEATH. IT GIVES YOU AN

03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:15.868
OPPORTUNITY TO STAY IN THAT

03:55:15.935 --> 03:55:18.003
HOME WITHOUT HAVING IT BE

03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:19.738
REASSESSED AND REQUIRING YOU

03:55:19.805 --> 03:55:21.474
PERHAPS TO MOVE BECAUSE YOUR

03:55:21.540 --> 03:55:23.709
CURRENT INCOME DID NOT SUPPORT

03:55:23.776 --> 03:55:25.778
THAT REASSESSMENT COST TO THAT

03:55:25.845 --> 03:55:27.713
WAS THE GOAL OF PROP THIRTEEN

03:55:27.780 --> 03:55:29.482
AND THIS HAS BEEN AYE BLOOM

03:55:29.548 --> 03:55:32.751
ABUSED BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS

03:55:32.818 --> 03:55:34.954
OF OWNING THE PROPERTY RATING

03:55:35.020 --> 03:55:37.490
IT FOR A LARGE AMOUNT AND THEN

03:55:37.556 --> 03:55:40.259
NOT PAYING THE- TESTAMENT THAT-

03:55:40.326 --> 03:55:41.160
IT WAS IT'S VALUED TODAY SO

03:55:41.227 --> 03:55:42.495
THERE'S A WINNER BUT THERE'S A

03:55:42.561 --> 03:55:44.363
WIN THERE I BELIEVE WIN FOR

03:55:44.430 --> 03:55:46.031

03:56:03.983 --> 03:56:06.485
ALSO A GREAT WIN FOR THE

03:56:06.552 --> 03:56:08.053
COUNTIES AND FOR THOSE SENIORS

03:56:08.120 --> 03:56:10.322

PIECE OF LEGISLATION NUMBER ONE

03:59:08.701 --> 03:59:10.803
THERE IS A QUALIFIED. BALLOT

03:59:10.869 --> 03:59:13.038
INITIATIVE THAT'S ON THAT- IN

03:59:13.105 --> 03:59:15.107

AND IF YOU'LL IF YOU'VE NOTICED

03:59:25.984 --> 03:59:29.221
IN YOUR ANALYSIS THAT THE FARM

03:59:29.288 --> 03:59:30.689
BUREAU HAS SUPPORTED THIS.

03:59:30.756 --> 03:59:33.058
PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND THAT'S

03:59:33.125 --> 03:59:35.194
BECAUSE IT DOES PROTECT THE

03:59:35.260 --> 03:59:36.729
FAMILY FARM AND THE AND THE

03:59:36.795 --> 03:59:38.764

04:08:50.949 --> 04:08:51.983
PERHAPS ONE EXAMPLE WAS

04:08:52.050 --> 04:08:53.685
HYDROCHLORIC WHEN WHICH WAS

04:08:53.752 --> 04:08:55.320
ORIGINALLY TOUTED BY SOME AS A

04:08:59.591 --> 04:09:00.659
ACTUALLY DEPEND ON THE STRUGGLE

04:09:00.725 --> 04:09:04.729
AT LUPUS AND ARTHRITIS ACTUALLY

04:09:04.796 --> 04:09:05.330
HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING YET.

04:09:05.397 --> 04:09:07.866
IN AREAS SUCH AS- AN AREAS IN

DOBIE SUPPLY ISSUES FOR THOSE

04:09:23.448 --> 04:09:25.684
DRUGS AS WELL. SO IN ADDITION

04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:26.818
TO INCREASING COMPETITION

04:09:26.885 --> 04:09:28.186
LOWERING PRICES IN ADDRESSING

04:09:28.253 --> 04:09:29.287
SHORTAGES SETTING UP A

CALIFORNIA HAS ITS OWN DRUG

04:09:32.223 --> 04:09:33.725
MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WILL

04:09:33.792 --> 04:09:35.060
HELP PREPARE TO STATE FOR THE

ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU

SACRAMENTO PRESIDENT

COLLEAGUES- THIS IS ANOTHER.

04:09:49.808 --> 04:09:51.376
BILL THAT ENCOURAGES IS DRIFT

04:09:51.443 --> 04:09:53.278
FROM WHAT IS THE MAIN PURPOSE

04:09:53.345 --> 04:09:55.113
OF GOVERNMENT. OBTAINING

04:09:55.180 --> 04:09:56.481
AFFORDABLE DRUGS WHILE

04:09:56.548 --> 04:09:58.750
ADMIRABLE IS NOT THE CORE

04:09:58.817 --> 04:10:01.886
FUNCTION. OF STATE GOVERNMENTS

04:10:01.953 --> 04:10:03.521
WHY ADD MORE EMPLOYEES WITH THE

04:10:03.588 --> 04:10:05.256
RESULTING EXPENSIVE PENSION

04:10:05.323 --> 04:10:07.092
PLANS AND OTHER BENEFITS FAR

04:10:07.158 --> 04:10:08.393
EXCEEDING WHAT IS OFFERED IN

04:10:08.460 --> 04:10:09.894
THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO THE

04:10:09.961 --> 04:10:12.397
STATE'S PAYROLL. SINCE THERE IS

04:10:12.464 --> 04:10:13.598
NO BUT IN THE ANALYSIS ALL WE

04:10:13.665 --> 04:10:15.100
CAN ASSUME IS THAT THIS NEW

04:10:15.166 --> 04:10:16.668
DEPARTMENT WILL SELL

04:10:16.735 --> 04:10:17.802
MANUFACTURE GENERIC

04:10:17.869 --> 04:10:21.406
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AT A FAIR

04:10:21.473 --> 04:10:24.042
PRICE. ONE HAS TO ASSUME THAT

04:10:24.109 --> 04:10:25.510
THE PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE

04:10:25.577 --> 04:10:26.711
COST TO MANUFACTURE PLUS

04:10:26.778 --> 04:10:28.179
OVERHEAD. BUT IT SEEMS TO BE

04:10:28.246 --> 04:10:30.849
SILENT ON WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

04:10:30.915 --> 04:10:32.417
HAVE AN EXCESS INVENTORY. IS IT

04:10:32.484 --> 04:10:34.452
SOLD BELOW COST THIS IS THE

04:10:34.519 --> 04:10:36.554
STATE SUBSIDIZE THE LOS IS THIS

04:10:36.621 --> 04:10:38.790
A FOR PROFIT ENDEAVOR LIKE AN

04:10:38.857 --> 04:10:40.225
ENTERPRISE FUND. AND HARPER

04:10:40.291 --> 04:10:42.227
PROFITS HANDLED SHOULD THEY

04:10:42.293 --> 04:10:43.328
OCCUR. I WOULD APPRECIATE THE

04:10:43.395 --> 04:10:44.629
BUSINESS PLAN IN THE OFFICE

04:10:44.696 --> 04:10:46.331
CLOSING REMARKS AND IN THE

04:10:46.398 --> 04:10:46.998
MEANTIME UNDER THE FISCAL

04:10:47.065 --> 04:10:48.967
CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD RECOMMEND

04:10:49.033 --> 04:10:51.936
DEFERRING SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO.

04:10:52.003 --> 04:10:54.806

04:10:59.677 --> 04:11:01.546
PRESIDENT A MEMBER SO I STAND

04:11:01.613 --> 04:11:02.614
IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND

04:11:02.680 --> 04:11:04.315
I WOULD JUST POINT OUT I THINK

04:11:04.382 --> 04:11:06.718
MANY OF US FEEL THAT A VERY

04:11:06.785 --> 04:11:08.553
FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF GOVERNMENT

04:11:08.620 --> 04:11:11.656
IS TO PROTECT OUR CONSUMERS AND

04:11:11.723 --> 04:11:14.459
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE COST OF

04:11:14.526 --> 04:11:16.694
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND THE

04:11:16.761 --> 04:11:19.164
INCREDIBLE PRICE INCREASES OR

04:11:19.230 --> 04:11:21.733
JUST THE PRICES THAT AMERICANS

04:11:21.800 --> 04:11:24.903
FACE COMPARED TO CANADIANS AND

04:11:24.969 --> 04:11:26.938
EVERY OTHER OECD COUNTRIES. YOU

04:11:27.005 --> 04:11:29.040
GOTTA WONDER WHAT'S WRONG AND

04:11:29.107 --> 04:11:30.508
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT

04:11:30.575 --> 04:11:33.478
ESSENTIAL LIFESAVING DRUGS LIKE

04:11:33.545 --> 04:11:35.613
THOSE THAT DIABETICS NEED WHICH

04:11:35.680 --> 04:11:38.183
ANYONE CAN CHECK AND SEE OVER

04:11:38.249 --> 04:11:39.551
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HOW

04:11:39.617 --> 04:11:42.954
THEIR ASTRONOMICAL RICE. SO I

04:11:43.021 --> 04:11:47.125
THINK A IF A DEPARTMENT LIKE

04:11:47.192 --> 04:11:48.493
THIS. WOULD COULD RESULT IN

04:11:48.560 --> 04:11:53.198
GIVING. RELIEF TO THE MILLIONS

04:11:53.264 --> 04:11:55.300
OF CALIFORNIANS WHO PAY OUT

04:11:55.366 --> 04:11:57.602
REGIS PRICES FOR THEIR

04:11:57.669 --> 04:11:59.904
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEN WE

04:11:59.971 --> 04:12:03.041
WOULD BE DOING A GREAT SERVICE

04:12:03.107 --> 04:12:03.641
AS THE STATE GOVERNMENT THANK

04:12:03.708 --> 04:12:07.479
YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER

04:12:07.545 --> 04:12:07.946
ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR

04:12:08.012 --> 04:12:10.882
DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING

04:12:10.949 --> 04:12:12.650
ON SENATOR PAN YOU MAY CLOSE

04:12:12.717 --> 04:12:15.720
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I

04:12:15.787 --> 04:12:16.321
FIRST OF ALL I WOULD POINT OUT

04:12:16.387 --> 04:12:19.324
THAT. ANY OF THESE DRUGS. ARE

04:12:19.390 --> 04:12:21.359
DRUGS IN WHICH- PEOPLE'S LIVES

04:12:21.426 --> 04:12:23.495
DEPEND ON THEM- AND- FOR

04:12:23.561 --> 04:12:26.297
EXAMPLE INSULIN IF YOU'RE A DIE

04:12:26.364 --> 04:12:27.532
BACKING OF INSULIN YOU WILL DIE.

04:12:27.599 --> 04:12:29.067
SO ASSURING THAT WE HAVE A

04:12:29.133 --> 04:12:30.702
RELIABLE SUPPLY IS CERTAINLY

04:12:30.768 --> 04:12:31.769
VERY IMPORTANT OR OTHER

04:12:31.836 --> 04:12:33.771
MEDICATIONS WELL WE'VE ACTUALLY

04:12:33.838 --> 04:12:34.472
HAD DINNER MEDICATIONS WHICH

04:12:34.539 --> 04:12:35.673
HAVE BEEN SEVERE SHORTAGE

04:12:35.740 --> 04:12:37.642
BECAUSE- UNFORTUNATELY

04:12:37.709 --> 04:12:38.576
ECONOMICS DID NOT ALLOW FOR

04:12:38.643 --> 04:12:40.945
LIABLE SUPPLIES SO. BUT TONIGHT

04:12:41.012 --> 04:12:43.748
SO- THERE'S A DRUG THAT

04:12:43.815 --> 04:12:44.315
BASICALLY STE USED TREATING-

04:12:44.382 --> 04:12:48.319
LEUKEMIA THAT WAS IN SHORT

04:12:48.386 --> 04:12:49.254
SUPPLY AND THERE WAS A

04:12:49.320 --> 04:12:50.655
CHALLENGES TRYING TO PROVIDE

04:12:50.722 --> 04:12:51.756
LEUKEMIA TREATMENTS FOR

04:12:51.823 --> 04:12:53.324
CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THAT- WITH

04:12:53.391 --> 04:12:55.360
THAT OTHER OCCASIONS AS WELL AT

04:12:55.426 --> 04:12:55.860
THE SAME TIME WE'VE ALSO

04:12:55.927 --> 04:12:57.495
EXPERIENCED. AND SEEN STORIES

04:12:57.562 --> 04:12:59.597
ABOUT MEDICATIONS AND WHICH-

04:12:59.664 --> 04:13:00.965
MAYBE IT'S GONE DOWN THE ONE

04:13:01.032 --> 04:13:02.200
MANUFACTURER AND HEDGE FUND

04:13:02.267 --> 04:13:03.768
MANAGER DECIDES TO BUY THAT

04:13:03.835 --> 04:13:05.169
COMPANY AND JACK UP THE PRICES

04:13:05.236 --> 04:13:07.005
SO- I THINK WE'VE ALL HEARD

04:13:07.071 --> 04:13:07.872
ABOUT SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES AS

04:13:07.939 --> 04:13:10.808
WELL. AND NOW IT AND SO KNOWING

04:13:10.875 --> 04:13:13.378
THAT- AN ENTITY LIKE THE STATE-

04:13:13.444 --> 04:13:15.513
MIGHT ENTER SUCH A MARKETS-

04:13:15.580 --> 04:13:16.548
WOULD ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE

04:13:16.614 --> 04:13:18.883
PEOPLE FROM TRYING TO ENGAGE IN

04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:19.450
THIS KIND OF PREDATORY

04:13:19.517 --> 04:13:20.685
BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY

04:13:20.752 --> 04:13:22.554
PATIENTS WHO ARE DEPEND ON

04:13:22.620 --> 04:13:24.222
THESE DRUGS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT

04:13:24.289 --> 04:13:25.223
ALSO POINT OUT THE BILL

04:13:25.290 --> 04:13:26.724
ACTUALLY ACCESS TO FURTHER

04:13:26.791 --> 04:13:29.794
INVESTIGATE- THE VIABILITY OF

04:13:29.861 --> 04:13:31.829
THIS IDEA AND TO LOOK INTO SOME

04:13:31.896 --> 04:13:33.598
OF THE TAIL SO WHY APPRECIATE-

04:13:33.665 --> 04:13:35.099
MY GOOD FRIEND FROM COSTA MESA

04:13:35.166 --> 04:13:35.700

PART OF THE- BILL. IS ACTUALLY

04:13:38.036 --> 04:13:40.271
TO DO JUST THAT SO I HOPE YOU

04:13:40.338 --> 04:13:41.239

04:13:41.306 --> 04:13:43.675

WE WILL CRAFTING TO FURTHER

04:13:45.543 --> 04:13:46.811
LEGISLATION IF WE CHOOSE TO

04:13:46.878 --> 04:13:48.479
BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE

04:13:48.546 --> 04:13:50.615
GATHER- TO MOVE FURTHER IN THIS

04:13:50.682 --> 04:13:52.016

DID THEY COME SWARMING INTO THE

04:20:19.804 --> 04:20:24.041
POLLS. I WOULD HOPE SO. BUT I

04:20:24.108 --> 04:20:27.678
DOUBT IT. AND THEN THERE'S

04:20:27.745 --> 04:20:31.282
ANOTHER LITTLE ASIDE TO THIS.

04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:32.850

CITIZENS. IT'S SUCH THINGS AS A

04:20:38.856 --> 04:20:40.825
DRIVING. WE'RE ELEVATING THE

04:20:40.891 --> 04:20:44.462
AGE. THAT THEY NEED MORE

04:20:44.528 --> 04:20:48.666
MATURITY. MORE EXPERIENCE.

04:20:48.733 --> 04:20:50.468
THOSE SAME POINTS LADIES AND

GENTLEMAN APPLY HERE. ONE THING

04:20:54.071 --> 04:21:00.277
ABOUT THIS GENERATION. MAYBE

04:21:00.344 --> 04:21:01.278
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT TOO EASY

04:21:01.345 --> 04:21:04.648
FOR. I ARGUED IT WAS TOO EASY

04:21:04.715 --> 04:21:07.284
FOR MY GENERATION. AND I

04:21:07.351 --> 04:21:09.086
ACTUALLY MISSED THE GREATEST

04:21:09.153 --> 04:21:12.056
GENERATION BY YOURSELF. BUT I

04:21:12.123 --> 04:21:13.157
ALWAYS SAID THAT MY PARENTS

04:21:13.224 --> 04:21:15.926
FAILED ME THEY WERE THE PRODUCT

04:21:15.993 --> 04:21:17.828
OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND

04:21:17.895 --> 04:21:18.996
THEY VOWED THAT THEIR CHILDREN

04:21:19.063 --> 04:21:20.231
WILL NEVER SO SUFFER AND SO

04:21:20.297 --> 04:21:23.834
THEY MADE IT TOO EASY FOR US.

04:21:23.901 --> 04:21:26.103
WELL MY DAD DIDN'T MAKE IT

04:21:26.170 --> 04:21:27.071
EASIER FOR ME BUT THAT'S

04:21:27.138 --> 04:21:28.939
ANOTHER STORY AND I'VE ALWAYS

04:21:29.006 --> 04:21:32.476
THANKED HIM FOR THAT. BUT ALSO

04:21:32.543 --> 04:21:36.147
APPRECIATED THE MATURITY AND

04:21:36.213 --> 04:21:39.850
WISDOM. GROWING UP WITH MORE

04:21:39.917 --> 04:21:43.788
RESPONSIBILITIES. AND NOW THEN

04:21:43.854 --> 04:21:45.489
I THINK MYSELF I'M GUILTY WITH

04:21:45.556 --> 04:21:47.224
MY OWN CHILDREN OF BEING TOO

04:21:47.291 --> 04:21:49.427
GOOD TO THEM. MAKING THINGS TOO

04:21:49.493 --> 04:21:52.363
EASY ON THEM. LIFE EXPERIENCE

04:21:52.430 --> 04:21:54.632
IS VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU LEARN.

04:21:54.698 --> 04:21:57.668
FROM YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE. IT

04:21:57.735 --> 04:22:02.306
AGAIN THE ABJECT IN ATTENTION.

04:22:02.373 --> 04:22:04.375
OF OUR KILL CHILDREN TO THE

04:22:04.442 --> 04:22:06.343
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SURROUND

04:22:06.410 --> 04:22:07.511
THEM THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT

04:22:07.578 --> 04:22:12.049
MEANS TO THEM. IT'S SAD. SO I

04:22:12.116 --> 04:22:13.317
HAVE DEDICATED MYSELF TO

04:22:13.384 --> 04:22:15.386
MENTORING THAT'S MY SMALL

04:22:15.453 --> 04:22:18.989
CONTRIBUTION CHILD BY CHILD.

04:22:19.056 --> 04:22:22.593
BUT HERE I DON'T THINK WE'RE

04:22:22.660 --> 04:22:25.563
GOING TO DO ANY GOOD. TO

04:22:25.629 --> 04:22:27.865
MOTIVATE TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS

04:22:27.932 --> 04:22:30.201
TO SHOW UP AT ANY GREATER.

04:22:30.267 --> 04:22:32.770
BREAK THE POLLS IN THE EIGHTEEN

04:22:32.837 --> 04:22:37.341

04:22:37.408 --> 04:22:38.876

IT BROUGHT. READY SENATOR

04:22:43.781 --> 04:22:46.617
BORGIAS. THANK YOU MADAM

04:22:46.684 --> 04:22:49.854

04:22:49.920 --> 04:22:54.592
THIS. PROPOSITION AND IT

04:22:54.658 --> 04:22:56.961
HARKENS BACK TO OF A NUMBER OF

04:22:57.027 --> 04:22:57.428
OTHER ISSUES WHERE I'M

04:22:57.495 --> 04:23:00.631
SCRATCHING MY HEAD ASKING FOR.

04:23:00.698 --> 04:23:05.302
A DEFINITION WHAT IS AN ADULT.

04:23:05.369 --> 04:23:08.606

RESPONSIBILITIES AND

04:23:13.277 --> 04:23:16.547
OPPORTUNITIES. NORMALLY I THINK

04:23:16.614 --> 04:23:17.214
IT'S CITY CALIFORNIA WE

04:23:17.281 --> 04:23:19.150
DETERMINE AN ADULT TO BE

04:23:19.216 --> 04:23:21.886
EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE. THE

04:23:21.952 --> 04:23:23.087
REASON I BRING THAT UP IS THAT

04:23:23.154 --> 04:23:24.755
THERE SHOULD BE A DEGREE OF

04:23:24.822 --> 04:23:27.525
CONSISTENCY. ON A NUMBER OF

04:23:27.591 --> 04:23:31.195
FRONTS WHEN INDIVIDUAL BUT- A

ALONG WITH THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

OTHER STATES ARE THE SAME WAY

04:23:44.975 --> 04:23:47.711
THAT YOU MUST BE TWENTY ONE

04:23:47.778 --> 04:23:49.246

WAS FUN GOING WITH ALL THIS IS

04:24:22.680 --> 04:24:25.583

04:24:36.694 --> 04:24:39.263
HORRIBLE TURNOUT WHEN IT COMES

TO YOUNG FOLKS TURNING OUT AND

04:24:42.066 --> 04:24:42.566
BEING PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC

04:24:42.633 --> 04:24:45.135
PROCESS. THAT'S A VISIBLE

04:24:45.202 --> 04:24:47.371
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. BUT THIS

04:24:47.438 --> 04:24:48.806
IS NOT GOING TO BE THE ANSWER

04:24:48.872 --> 04:24:51.342
IN FACT HE JUST CREATES ANOTHER

04:24:51.408 --> 04:24:52.977
STRANGE IRREGULARITY

04:24:53.043 --> 04:24:54.878

HIS ASSASSINATION AT THIRTY

04:25:47.731 --> 04:25:49.133
NINE. YOU KNOW IN MY OPINION

04:25:49.199 --> 04:25:50.768
CIVIC ENGAGEMENT CAN'T START

04:25:50.834 --> 04:25:54.238

SEPARATELY. AND WE RECOGNIZE

04:26:02.146 --> 04:26:04.381
THAT ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF A

YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE IS GOVERNED

04:26:06.083 --> 04:26:07.518
BY A DECISION MADE BY SOME

04:26:07.584 --> 04:26:09.753
ELECTED BODY. THE FACT THAT

04:26:09.820 --> 04:26:11.021
THEY HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THE

04:26:11.088 --> 04:26:13.057
TYPE OF CURRICULUM THEY STUDY

04:26:13.123 --> 04:26:14.491
IN CALIFORNIA FOR A WHILE YOU

EXAM THE DECISION MADE BY THE

04:26:18.262 --> 04:26:20.931
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. SO WHAT

04:26:20.998 --> 04:26:23.567
IS THE HARM IN GIVING THEM

04:26:23.634 --> 04:26:26.236
ENCOURAGING THEM INVITING THEM

04:26:26.303 --> 04:26:28.105

AND DOWN THE STREETS WHO ARE.

04:35:28.745 --> 04:35:30.847

04:35:37.320 --> 04:35:38.989
A WAY. THAT NOW WE SEE A

04:35:39.055 --> 04:35:41.358
QUALITY OF FURNACE TODAY WE

EIGHTEEN SO I DON'T THINK WE

04:35:59.643 --> 04:36:01.444

04:36:01.511 --> 04:36:03.280
PROGRESS IN EDUCATION AND

04:36:03.346 --> 04:36:05.448

THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. SO

04:36:13.590 --> 04:36:15.292
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A HARD

04:36:15.358 --> 04:36:16.226

MINIMUS AND SO THAT REPORT IS

04:52:55.958 --> 04:52:58.160
THERE ARE YOU KNOW TO BELIEVE

04:52:58.227 --> 04:53:02.665
ME ARE NEUTRAL- EVALUATORS MADE

TERMS OF TRYING MEDI CAL FIRST.

04:53:08.304 --> 04:53:09.972
THE REALITIES MEDI CAL IS

ALREADY DOING THIS MEDI CAL

04:53:12.241 --> 04:53:14.343
DIDN'T NEED A LEGAL MANDATE TO

04:53:14.410 --> 04:53:16.412
DO IT AND MEDICAL COVERAGE IS

04:53:16.478 --> 04:53:18.080
MUCH BROADER THAN THE PRIVATE

04:53:18.147 --> 04:53:20.115
INDUSTRY IF THE PRIVATE HEALTH

04:53:20.182 --> 04:53:22.184
INSURANCE INDUSTRY WERE ALREADY

04:53:22.251 --> 04:53:22.785
DOING THIS WE WOULDN'T NEED A

04:53:22.851 --> 04:53:24.887
BILL. UNFORTUNATELY WE SEEN

04:53:24.954 --> 04:53:26.689
YEAR AFTER YEAR DECADE AFTER

04:53:26.755 --> 04:53:28.490
DECADE. THAT THE PRIVATE HEALTH

04:53:28.557 --> 04:53:30.726
<u>&lt;c.red&gt;NSURANCE INDUSTRY- HAS&lt;/c&gt;</u>

04:53:30.793 --> 04:53:32.328
DRAMATICALLY LIMITED ITS

04:53:32.394 --> 04:53:34.797
COVERAGE. AND WE WOULD NEVER

04:53:34.863 --> 04:53:35.898
TOLERATE THAT FOR PHYSICAL

04:53:35.965 --> 04:53:37.866
HEALTH HOWEVER AND YET WE'VE

04:53:37.933 --> 04:53:39.969
BEEN TOLERATING IT FOR PEOPLE

04:53:40.035 --> 04:53:41.470
WHO ARE ADDICTED. PEOPLE WHO

04:53:41.537 --> 04:53:44.773
ARE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE

04:53:44.840 --> 04:53:47.977
MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND

04:53:48.043 --> 04:53:50.012
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PEOPLE-

04:53:50.079 --> 04:53:51.213
WHEN THEY'RE PRIVATE HEALTH

04:53:51.280 --> 04:53:53.282
INSURANCE COMPANY DOESN'T COVER

04:53:53.349 --> 04:53:56.452
THEM. GOING TO CRISIS THEY LOSE

04:53:56.518 --> 04:53:58.320
THEIR JOB THEY LOSE THEIR

04:53:58.387 --> 04:54:01.657
HOUSING THEY LOSE THEIR FAMILY.

04:54:01.724 --> 04:54:03.459
AND THEN WHO PAYS FOR THEM

04:54:03.525 --> 04:54:05.794
GUESS WHAT NOT THE PRIVATE

04:54:05.861 --> 04:54:07.396
HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

04:54:07.463 --> 04:54:08.564
BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR JOB

04:54:08.630 --> 04:54:11.233
THEY'VE LOST THEIR INSURANCE.

04:54:11.300 --> 04:54:13.702
US IT'S THE TAXPAYERS AND S BY

04:54:13.769 --> 04:54:15.237
THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY

04:54:15.304 --> 04:54:17.473
REFUSING TO COVER FAILING TO

04:54:17.539 --> 04:54:20.609
COVER SO MANY MENTAL HEALTH AND

04:54:20.676 --> 04:54:22.211
ADDICTION CHALLENGES. IT

04:54:22.277 --> 04:54:23.912
BECOMES A SUBSIDY BY THE

04:54:23.979 --> 04:54:26.181
TAXPAYERS BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE

04:54:26.248 --> 04:54:28.484
AND ARE IN CRISIS ON THE

04:54:28.550 --> 04:54:30.986
STREETS INDIGENT AND THE

04:54:31.053 --> 04:54:33.222
TAXPAYERS CARE FOR THEM. SO I

04:54:33.288 --> 04:54:34.990
THINK THE HEALTH INSURANCE

04:54:35.057 --> 04:54:36.725
INDUSTRY SHOULD DO ITS JOB. AND

04:54:36.792 --> 04:54:38.660
SHOULD COVER ALL MEDICALLY

04:54:38.727 --> 04:54:40.262
NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH AND

04:54:40.329 --> 04:54:42.664
ADDICTION CARE. THIS IS ONLY

04:54:42.731 --> 04:54:44.767
ONE A DOCTOR SAYS UNDER

04:54:44.833 --> 04:54:46.235
APPLICABLE MEDICAL STANDARDS

04:54:46.301 --> 04:54:47.236
THAT THIS TREATMENT IS

04:54:47.302 --> 04:54:49.071
MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THIS

04:54:49.138 --> 04:54:51.040

04:54:51.106 --> 04:54:51.940

COMPANY. THE WOMEN WERE PAID

05:31:23.396 --> 05:31:25.432
FAR LESS THAN THE MEN FOR

THEY WERE NOT IN THE SAME

05:31:33.240 --> 05:31:35.709
LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT AND SO HE

05:31:35.775 --> 05:31:38.178

KILLER IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. IT

05:49:05.291 --> 05:49:07.293
WAS USED IN THAT MATTER TO MAKE

05:49:07.359 --> 05:49:08.193
SURE THAT THAT WE BROUGHT

05:49:08.260 --> 05:49:10.062

PROMINENT. COLLECTORS OF DNA

REQUIRES OTHER SUBPOENA. I

05:49:34.019 --> 05:49:34.853
PERSONALLY THINK A SEARCH

05:49:34.920 --> 05:49:36.488
WARRANT IS TOO MUCH BUT BUT

05:49:36.555 --> 05:49:37.489
THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MIDDLE

05:49:37.556 --> 05:49:38.590
GROUND WHERE THERE'S A

05:49:38.657 --> 05:49:40.826
REASONABLE PROCESS SO THAT THEY

05:49:40.893 --> 05:49:43.862
CAN ACCESS THAT INFORMATION AND

05:49:43.929 --> 05:49:44.463
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

05:49:44.530 --> 05:49:45.931
THEM. SO LIKE USING THE EXAMPLE

05:49:45.998 --> 05:49:46.932
OF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER ON

05:49:46.999 --> 05:49:48.367
MY OWN TIME I GUESS HUSING

05:49:48.434 --> 05:49:49.868
EXAMPLE AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME

05:49:49.935 --> 05:49:51.203
IN YOUR CLOTHES IF I'M WRONG.

05:49:51.270 --> 05:49:52.671
IF THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GET

05:49:52.738 --> 05:49:53.839
THAT DE ANNE THEN THERE'S A

05:49:53.906 --> 05:49:54.840
GOOD CHANCE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE

05:49:54.907 --> 05:49:55.974
BEEN ABLE TO CONVICT THIS

05:49:56.041 --> 05:49:58.077
PERSON THAT HAD RAPED AND

05:49:58.143 --> 05:49:59.511
MURDERED SEVERAL WOMEN. BUT

05:49:59.578 --> 05:50:01.547
UNDER. THIS PIECE OF

05:50:01.613 --> 05:50:04.049
LEGISLATION- THERE IS A

05:50:04.116 --> 05:50:05.351
POSSIBILITY THAT THAT.

05:50:05.417 --> 05:50:06.852
INFORMATION BECAUSE IN YOUR

05:50:06.919 --> 05:50:08.253
STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT. THE

05:50:08.320 --> 05:50:09.555
PERSON SO THE GOLDEN STATE

05:50:09.621 --> 05:50:11.156
KILLER WOULD HAVE TO AUTHORIZE

05:50:11.223 --> 05:50:14.193
THE RELEASE. OF HIS DATA. WHICH

05:50:14.259 --> 05:50:15.728
I REALLY DON'T THINK THE GOLDEN

05:50:15.794 --> 05:50:16.729
STATE KILLERS GOING TO

05:50:16.795 --> 05:50:18.364
AUTHORIZE. THE RELEASE OF HIS

05:50:18.430 --> 05:50:19.865
DATA THAT HE KNOWS THAT WOULD

05:50:19.932 --> 05:50:22.735
CONVICT HIM. I COULD BE WRONG.

05:50:22.801 --> 05:50:24.770
BUT I DON'T THINK SO. SO I

05:50:24.837 --> 05:50:26.538
GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT. WITH

05:50:26.605 --> 05:50:29.308

ISSUE. BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE

05:50:33.445 --> 05:50:36.582
THAT IT WILL HINDER. JUSTICE

05:50:36.648 --> 05:50:38.751
FOR THOSE THAT- WANT TO GO

05:50:38.817 --> 05:50:40.285
FREE. AND I THINK IT WILL

05:50:40.352 --> 05:50:43.722
HINDER. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

05:50:43.789 --> 05:50:44.723
FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I

05:50:44.790 --> 05:50:46.125
DON'T THINK SOMEONE LIKE THE

05:50:46.191 --> 05:50:47.226
GOLDEN STATE KILLER WHO IS

05:50:47.292 --> 05:50:48.894

LET ME OF FIRST TO ADDRESS THE

06:08:34.525 --> 06:08:36.828
POINTS FROM THIS. SENATOR FROM

06:08:36.894 --> 06:08:38.763
FREMONT THAT HE REYES. ABOUT

06:08:38.830 --> 06:08:41.365
THE- EXPEDITED REVIEW THIS BILL

06:08:41.432 --> 06:08:42.300
PROVIDES AND I'M VERY SUPPORT

06:08:42.366 --> 06:08:46.838
OF A- WE HAD A BILL- LAST YEAR-

06:08:46.904 --> 06:08:48.973
THAT I AUTHORED THAT PASSES

06:08:49.040 --> 06:08:51.676
FLOOR THAT PROVIDED FOR THAT.

06:08:51.742 --> 06:08:53.377
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY REVIEW.

06:08:53.444 --> 06:08:54.745
AT THE SAME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN

06:08:54.812 --> 06:08:55.980
RAISED ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF

06:08:56.047 --> 06:08:57.982
THE COURT PROCESSING OF THOSE

06:08:58.049 --> 06:09:00.384
ISSUES. BUT I WOULD SAY TO MY

06:09:00.451 --> 06:09:02.353
FRIEND. AND TO ALL OF YOU THAT

06:09:02.420 --> 06:09:04.622
IF THE ISSUE IS A WE HAVE A

06:09:04.689 --> 06:09:06.257
HOUSING CRISIS. AND THAT WE'RE

06:09:06.324 --> 06:09:07.758
SIMPLY ASKING THE COURTS IN THE

06:09:07.825 --> 06:09:09.694
UNUSUAL CASES WERE CHALLENGES

06:09:09.760 --> 06:09:12.530
AT A VAST THAT THEY- REVIEW IT

06:09:12.597 --> 06:09:14.065
AND PROCESS IT QUICKLY. IT

06:09:14.131 --> 06:09:15.132
WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IF THERE

06:09:15.199 --> 06:09:16.934
IS A NEED FOR RESOURCES TO GO

06:09:17.001 --> 06:09:18.202
TO THE COURTS TO DO THAT AND

06:09:18.269 --> 06:09:19.871
THOSE UNIQUE CASES. THAT IT

06:09:19.937 --> 06:09:21.072
WOULD BE AN EASY SELL FOR ALL

06:09:21.138 --> 06:09:23.007
OF US TO MAKE SURE THE COURTS

06:09:23.074 --> 06:09:25.109
ARE PROPERLY FUNDED. TO DO THAT

06:09:25.176 --> 06:09:27.378
IS THAT A SEQUEL CORD. NORTH

06:09:27.445 --> 06:09:28.679
SIX THE COURT SOUTH I DON'T

06:09:28.746 --> 06:09:29.914
KNOW BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE'RE

06:09:29.981 --> 06:09:31.415
TALKING ABOUT A PENNY. FOR

06:09:31.482 --> 06:09:34.051
SOMETHING THAT HAS A AND A

06:09:34.118 --> 06:09:35.186
MULTIPLE BENEFIT THAT WE ALL

06:09:35.253 --> 06:09:37.288
RECOGNIZE. WHICH IS THE HOUSING

06:09:37.355 --> 06:09:42.527
CRISIS THAT WE ARE. FACING THE

06:09:42.593 --> 06:09:43.728
ISSUE THAT I HAVE REYES

06:09:43.794 --> 06:09:45.630
PREVIOUSLY AND IT. IS A BROADER

06:09:45.696 --> 06:09:47.431
ISSUE ON THE HOUSING PACKAGE.

06:09:47.498 --> 06:09:49.066
SUCH AS THIS BILL WHICH I'M

06:09:49.133 --> 06:09:50.301
HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY. IS THE

06:09:50.368 --> 06:09:53.371
FACT THAT. WE EXERCISE OUR

06:09:53.437 --> 06:09:55.139
GREAT WISDOM ABOUT HOW WE CAN

06:09:55.206 --> 06:09:56.941
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT AT THE

06:09:57.008 --> 06:09:59.176
END OF THE DAY IT'S NOT GOING

06:09:59.243 --> 06:09:59.710
TO BE SOLVED BY GOVERNMENT

06:09:59.777 --> 06:10:01.579
SUBSIDY. IT'S GOING TO BE DONE

06:10:01.646 --> 06:10:04.749
BY PRIVATE SECTOR. INVESTMENT

06:10:04.815 --> 06:10:06.951
THAT DECIDES THAT THE RISKS ARE

06:10:07.018 --> 06:10:10.087
WORTH THE REWARDS. AND SO

06:10:10.154 --> 06:10:11.689
WHATEVER WE DO ON THIS FLOOR IN

06:10:11.756 --> 06:10:13.291
THIS LEGISLATURE IF IT DOESN'T

06:10:13.357 --> 06:10:17.762
MEET THAT. FIVE EQUALS SIGN

06:10:17.828 --> 06:10:18.396
NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO REALLY

06:10:18.462 --> 06:10:21.332
HAPPEN. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WE

06:10:21.399 --> 06:10:23.267
HAVE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

06:10:23.334 --> 06:10:24.936
THOUSAND APPROXIMATELY APPROVED

06:10:25.002 --> 06:10:26.470
UNITS THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED

06:10:26.537 --> 06:10:29.807
RIGHT NOW. NO LOCAL GOVERNMENT

06:10:29.874 --> 06:10:31.676
REVIEWED NO CYCLIC CHALLENGES

06:10:31.742 --> 06:10:33.811
THEY CAN BE ADVANCED. AND YOU

06:10:33.878 --> 06:10:35.246
HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHY

06:10:35.313 --> 06:10:37.915
AREN'T THEY BEING BUILT THAT'S

06:10:37.982 --> 06:10:40.484
A TWO YEAR SUPPLY TODAY. AND A

06:10:40.551 --> 06:10:41.852
LOT OF THE BILLS IN THE

06:10:41.919 --> 06:10:42.787
CRITICISMS THAT HAVE COME

06:10:42.853 --> 06:10:44.055
FORWARD OR THAT LOCAL

06:10:44.121 --> 06:10:45.656
GOVERNMENTS ARE THE BLOCKAGE

06:10:45.723 --> 06:10:47.058
THEY'RE STOPPING THESE

06:10:47.124 --> 06:10:50.595
APPROVALS. AND UNFORTUNATELY I

06:10:50.661 --> 06:10:52.930
THINK THAT- POINTING A FINGER

06:10:52.997 --> 06:10:54.298
AT A PROBLEM THAT IS NOT SO

06:10:54.365 --> 06:10:56.000
APPARENT BUT- I KNOW THAT THE

06:10:56.067 --> 06:10:57.635
HOUSING BILLS THAT JUST THIS

06:10:57.702 --> 06:10:58.569
ONE BUT OTHERS THAT WE ARE

06:10:58.636 --> 06:11:00.371
CONSIDERING. TRY TO GO AT THAT

06:11:00.438 --> 06:11:03.975
ISSUE. OF EXPEDITING REVIEW BY

06:11:04.041 --> 06:11:05.743
RIGHT APPROVALS. AND I'M I'M

06:11:05.810 --> 06:11:09.847
FINE. CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

06:11:09.914 --> 06:11:11.983
APPROACH BECAUSE OF THE FACT

06:11:12.049 --> 06:11:12.583
THAT I JUST LAID OUT A MOMENT

06:11:12.650 --> 06:11:19.190
AGO. IN MY DISTRICT A FEW

06:11:19.256 --> 06:11:23.961
MONTHS AGO HI WE HAD A PROJECT

06:11:24.028 --> 06:11:24.562
FOR THIRTEEN THOUSAND HOUSING

06:11:24.629 --> 06:11:28.532
UNITS. IN THE CITY OF CONCORD

06:11:28.599 --> 06:11:29.066
THIRTEEN THOUSAND A LITTLE

06:11:29.133 --> 06:11:32.303
PROJECT. IT HAD BEEN WORKED ON

06:11:32.370 --> 06:11:35.973
FOR YEARS. AND IT FELL APART A

06:11:36.040 --> 06:11:38.142
FEW MONTHS AGO BECAUSE OF A

06:11:38.209 --> 06:11:39.777
DISPUTE BETWEEN THE UNION AND

06:11:39.844 --> 06:11:42.647
THE DEVELOPER. AND THE CITY

06:11:42.713 --> 06:11:45.583
DECIDED. BASED ON THAT DISPUTE

06:11:45.650 --> 06:11:47.218
THEIR INABILITY TO AGREE ON A

06:11:47.284 --> 06:11:49.186
PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT AND THE

06:11:49.253 --> 06:11:50.354
DEVELOPER HAD PUT FORWARD

06:11:50.421 --> 06:11:51.622
NUMEROUS PROJECT LABOR

06:11:51.689 --> 06:11:53.824
AGREEMENTS AND IDO AGREE TO

06:11:53.891 --> 06:11:55.059
INCLUDE UNION LABOR THROUGHOUT

06:11:55.126 --> 06:11:56.594
THE PROJECT. BUT BECAUSE THERE

06:11:56.661 --> 06:11:58.329
WAS AN AGREEMENT THE DECISION

06:11:58.396 --> 06:12:00.097
WAS MADE BY THE CITY TO

06:12:00.164 --> 06:12:02.833
TERMINATE THAT RELATIONSHIP.

06:12:02.900 --> 06:12:04.335
AND THAT THIRTEEN THOUSAND.

06:12:04.402 --> 06:12:05.770
HOUSING IN THE PROJECT WENT

06:12:05.836 --> 06:12:09.407
AWAY. SO WAS ANYBODY ON THE

06:12:09.473 --> 06:12:11.709
WRONG SIDE OF THE CHOICE HERE

06:12:11.776 --> 06:12:13.444
NOW WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO PAY

06:12:13.511 --> 06:12:15.413
MORE WHO WOULD WANT TO THERE'S

06:12:15.479 --> 06:12:17.214
SO MANY THINGS THAT MATCH OUR

06:12:17.281 --> 06:12:18.082
VALUES BUT WHEN IT ALL CAME

06:12:18.149 --> 06:12:20.017
TOGETHER THAT PROJECT

06:12:20.084 --> 06:12:22.153
COMPLETELY COLLAPSED. SO IT

06:12:22.219 --> 06:12:24.188
GOES BACK TO THE REAL WORLD

06:12:24.255 --> 06:12:25.723
WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE STREET

06:12:25.790 --> 06:12:28.125
THE DECISIONS WE MAKE HERE DO

06:12:28.192 --> 06:12:28.626
THEY REALLY EVEN MAKE A

06:12:28.693 --> 06:12:30.461
DIFFERENCE. AND THAT'S THE CASA

06:12:30.528 --> 06:12:32.730
THAT I PUT UP. ON THIS BILL AND

06:12:32.797 --> 06:12:35.633
ON OTHERS IS THAT. IS IT REALLY

06:12:35.700 --> 06:12:36.233
GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN

06:12:36.300 --> 06:12:42.006
THE MARKETPLACE. IF ARE

06:12:42.073 --> 06:12:43.974
ADMIRABLE AND ARE WORTHY OF

06:12:44.041 --> 06:12:47.511
GREAT SUPPORT. IF THERE'S A

06:12:47.578 --> 06:12:49.947
PROBLEM RESOLVE IT QUICKLY. SO

06:12:50.014 --> 06:12:51.315
THAT WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS AND

06:12:51.382 --> 06:12:53.517
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL

06:12:53.584 --> 06:12:54.051
IN ONE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT

06:12:54.118 --> 06:13:01.025
TODAY. SENATOR NIELSEN. MATTER

06:13:01.092 --> 06:13:03.294
PRESIDENT IF I MAY- QUESTION

06:13:03.360 --> 06:13:04.929
FOR THE AUTHOR OF THIS COMMENT

06:13:04.995 --> 06:13:07.665
ON MY OWN TIME. SENATOR YES

06:13:07.732 --> 06:13:09.967
REALLY CHAIR QUESTION. SENATE

06:13:10.034 --> 06:13:12.436
OR NIELSEN PLEASE PROCEED. THIS

06:13:12.503 --> 06:13:14.371
BILL HAS AN ATTRACTION BECAUSE

06:13:14.438 --> 06:13:17.308
IT IS AT LEAST ADDRESSING

06:13:17.374 --> 06:13:19.143
MOVING SEQUEL ALONG A LITTLE

06:13:19.210 --> 06:13:22.980
BIT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME BANE.

06:13:23.047 --> 06:13:26.217
THE QUESTION IS THIS IS A

06:13:26.283 --> 06:13:27.351
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR OF

06:13:27.418 --> 06:13:30.888
FIGURE. CAN THERE BE

06:13:30.955 --> 06:13:33.958
ACCOMMODATIONS HERE FOR RURAL

06:13:34.024 --> 06:13:35.459
COUNTIES OR ANOTHER

06:13:35.526 --> 06:13:37.762
CLASSIFICATION OF COUNTIES THAT

06:13:37.828 --> 06:13:39.930
I FIND ON MY OWN. IT'S CALLED

06:13:39.997 --> 06:13:44.435
NOT THIS URBAN SUBURBAN RURAL

06:13:44.502 --> 06:13:46.003
TEN YEARS AGO I COINED THE TERM

06:13:46.070 --> 06:13:47.938
SUBURBAN ISAAC THAT WOULD HAVE

06:13:48.005 --> 06:13:49.940
BEEN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY ABOUT

06:13:50.007 --> 06:13:51.842
FIFTY YEARS AGO SOLANO ABOUT

06:13:51.909 --> 06:13:53.477
FORTY AND THIRTY YEARS NOW IT'S

06:13:53.544 --> 06:13:54.745
IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING

06:13:54.812 --> 06:13:58.249
FROM RURAL. TO SUBURBAN. WOULD

06:13:58.315 --> 06:13:59.416
COUNTIES LIKE THAT THE

06:13:59.483 --> 06:14:01.185
SUBURBANITES AND COUNTY THAT'S

06:14:01.252 --> 06:14:03.287
GROWING. FOR THE RURAL COUNTY

06:14:03.354 --> 06:14:04.121
WOULD THERE BE ANY

06:14:04.188 --> 06:14:05.856
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO

06:14:05.923 --> 06:14:10.127
BENEFIT IN THIS SCHEME. SENATOR

06:14:10.194 --> 06:14:14.265
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I THINK THE-

06:14:14.331 --> 06:14:15.533
EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED STRUCTURE

06:14:15.599 --> 06:14:18.469
OF A HUNDRED MILLION- FOR MEGA

06:14:18.536 --> 06:14:21.205
PROJECTS PART OF THE DISCUSSION

06:14:21.272 --> 06:14:22.273
OF THE SENATORS ENGAGED IN THIS

06:14:22.339 --> 06:14:24.441
WAS. ODD WE NEED TO LOWER THAT

06:14:24.508 --> 06:14:26.877
THRESHOLD- AND FIFTY MILLION

06:14:26.944 --> 06:14:31.081
DOLLARS IT IS ABSOLUTELY A SIZE

06:14:31.148 --> 06:14:34.185
THAT CAN FIT MANY COMMUNITIES-

06:14:34.251 --> 06:14:37.087
RURAL SMALLER COMMUNITIES ARE

06:14:37.154 --> 06:14:39.056
SO THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT.

06:14:39.123 --> 06:14:41.592
THAT WE LOWER IT TO TAKE

06:14:41.659 --> 06:14:43.494
ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY

06:14:43.561 --> 06:14:45.262
SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES AND

06:14:45.329 --> 06:14:47.331
INCLUDES HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

06:14:47.398 --> 06:14:49.800
ALONG WITH THAT. SO IT WOULD

06:14:49.867 --> 06:14:54.638
ABSOLUTELY. BE AVAILABLE TO THE

06:14:54.705 --> 06:14:55.272
COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'RE TALKING

06:14:55.339 --> 06:14:57.341
ABOUT. I THANK YOU TO THE

06:14:57.408 --> 06:15:00.311
PROGRAM AND I WOULD ENDORSE THE

06:15:00.377 --> 06:15:01.879
BILL AND VOTE FOR THE BILL

06:15:01.946 --> 06:15:03.547
BECAUSE IT IS INDEED THAT

06:15:03.614 --> 06:15:05.616
SUSTAINING SOME OPPORTUNITIES

06:15:05.683 --> 06:15:07.284
THAT KIND OF A BEEN THWARTED IN

06:15:07.351 --> 06:15:09.653
THE PAST. AND WE HAVE SOME

06:15:09.720 --> 06:15:11.856
GROWTH WE'VE GOT COUNTIES THAT

06:15:11.922 --> 06:15:13.624
ARE DECLINING AND IN AND IN

06:15:13.691 --> 06:15:15.793
POPULATIONS AND MANY DIFFERENT

06:15:15.860 --> 06:15:17.294
FACTORS AND DYNAMICS IN

06:15:17.361 --> 06:15:19.430
CALIFORNIA BUT THIS DOES AT

06:15:19.496 --> 06:15:21.565
LEAST AFFORD SOME HOPE. FOR

06:15:21.632 --> 06:15:22.600
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN A

06:15:22.666 --> 06:15:24.068
LITTLE BIT AND CHANGE THAT FOR

06:15:24.134 --> 06:15:27.037
VERY LONG TIME AND I THANK YOU

06:15:27.104 --> 06:15:27.605
FOR ALTERING THE BILL EITHER

06:15:27.671 --> 06:15:30.107
TONIGHT. IS THERE ANY FURTHER

06:15:30.174 --> 06:15:31.909
DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS

06:15:31.976 --> 06:15:34.245
ITEM ANY OTHER MIKE SUB THAT I

06:15:34.311 --> 06:15:36.714
HAVE NOT SEEN. SEEING ALL

06:15:36.780 --> 06:15:39.049
DEBATE HAVING SEIZE SENATOR

06:15:39.116 --> 06:15:41.852

OPPORTUNITY AND THE NEED FOR

HAVE ACCESS. TO TOOLS THAT

06:18:02.593 --> 06:18:03.093
GOVERNMENT PUTS IN PLACE FOR

06:18:03.160 --> 06:18:08.165
THAT VERY REASON. WE NEED TO BE

06:18:08.232 --> 06:18:10.734
FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMY AS WELL

06:18:10.801 --> 06:18:12.336
AS THE NEED FOR HOUSING AS WELL

06:18:12.403 --> 06:18:14.772
AS THE NEED UNDER THE ECONOMY

06:18:14.838 --> 06:18:18.942
FOR GOOD JOBS. THIS CREATES AND

06:18:19.009 --> 06:18:19.943
HELPS PEOPLE MOVE INTO THE

06:18:20.010 --> 06:18:22.813
MIDDLE CLASS AND IT FOCUSES THE

06:18:22.880 --> 06:18:25.015

TRADITIONALLY BEEN

06:18:27.451 --> 06:18:30.587
DISADVANTAGED. AND HELPS WOMEN

06:18:30.654 --> 06:18:33.557
AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT

06:18:33.624 --> 06:18:34.591
HAVE TRADITIONALLY NOT HAD

06:18:34.658 --> 06:18:36.226

07:13:31.585 --> 07:13:32.553
WORK ON THIS BUDGET CERTAINLY

07:13:32.619 --> 07:13:34.621
THE STAFF I DON'T THINK THERE'S

07:13:34.688 --> 07:13:36.490
BEEN A MORE DIFFICULT TIME- IN

07:13:36.557 --> 07:13:38.759
ANY IN OUR RECENT HISTORY FOR A

07:13:38.826 --> 07:13:40.461
BUDGET TO BE PUT TOGETHER UNDER

07:13:40.527 --> 07:13:42.229
THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE-

07:13:42.296 --> 07:13:44.732
CHALLENGES THAT. FISCAL

07:13:44.798 --> 07:13:45.199
CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE

07:13:45.265 --> 07:13:47.334
CERTAINLY FACING- AND THAT

07:13:47.401 --> 07:13:50.771
CERTAINLY. A MOMENT TO EXPRESS

07:13:50.838 --> 07:13:54.541
GREAT PRAISE- TO THE LEADERSHIP.

07:13:54.608 --> 07:13:55.042
AND EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN

07:13:55.109 --> 07:13:58.879
INVOLVED IN AN. I'M NOT

07:13:58.946 --> 07:14:01.148
SPEAKING ON THIS BILL BECAUSE-

07:14:01.215 --> 07:14:02.516
THERE'S A LOT IN IT TOO TO

07:14:02.583 --> 07:14:05.519
LIGHT BUT THERE ARE A FEW

07:14:05.586 --> 07:14:07.154
THINGS IN IT THAT CAUSED ME

07:14:07.221 --> 07:14:11.925
GREAT I NEEDS. I HEAR THE-

07:14:11.992 --> 07:14:12.526
SUGGESTION THAT EVERYTHING IN

07:14:12.593 --> 07:14:16.296
THE BUDGET HAS POLICY BUT WHAT

07:14:16.363 --> 07:14:18.532
WE DO ASK IS THAT THAT THERE BE

07:14:18.599 --> 07:14:21.235
A GERMANE NECESSARY IT'S REMAIN

07:14:21.301 --> 07:14:23.570
AS TO FISCAL IN FACT FOR

07:14:23.637 --> 07:14:25.272
MEASURES TO BE INCLUDED IN

07:14:25.339 --> 07:14:27.508
BUDGET TRAILER BILLS. AND I

07:14:27.574 --> 07:14:29.276
THINK THAT- WHILE THE EFFORTS

07:14:29.343 --> 07:14:31.478
THAT HAVE BEEN ONGOING HAD BEEN

07:14:31.545 --> 07:14:33.046
DONE MOSTLY VERY VERY WELL IN

07:14:33.113 --> 07:14:35.682
THIS CASE I THINK THAT- THERE

07:14:35.749 --> 07:14:36.517
ARE A FEW PLACES WHERE IT FALLS

07:14:36.583 --> 07:14:38.752
SHORT. AND CERTAINLY FOR ME

07:14:38.819 --> 07:14:40.954
IT'S IN THE SENTENCING CHANGES

07:14:41.021 --> 07:14:43.590
IN THIS BILL. IF THE IDEA IS

07:14:43.657 --> 07:14:44.892
THAT IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT.

07:14:44.958 --> 07:14:48.762
BUDGET IMPACT. THAT SPEAKS TO

07:14:48.829 --> 07:14:50.431
THE SERIOUSNESS IN WHICH THE

07:14:50.497 --> 07:14:53.200
SENTENCING CHANGES. MAY HAVE A

07:14:53.267 --> 07:14:54.134
FAX AND I THINK THAT WOULD

07:14:54.201 --> 07:14:56.270
SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR FULL

07:14:56.336 --> 07:14:59.106
POLICY REVIEW. AND DELIBERATION

07:14:59.173 --> 07:15:00.774
SO WE CAN ALL MAKE A COLLECTIVE

07:15:00.841 --> 07:15:04.945
CHOICE. AGAIN THE BUDGET COMING

07:15:05.012 --> 07:15:05.913

THIS LEGISLATURE HAS FACED AND

07:15:16.023 --> 07:15:16.557
THAT'S WHY IT MAKES IT EVEN

07:15:16.623 --> 07:15:20.227
HARDER TO. GET ALL THIS

07:15:20.294 --> 07:15:22.029

07:17:26.386 --> 07:17:30.424
DESTROYED NEARLY UNUSUAL YEAR.

07:17:30.490 --> 07:17:31.925
BUT WOULD BE A YEAR WHERE WE

07:17:31.992 --> 07:17:34.261
SHOULD EXERCISE. OPTIMAL

07:17:34.328 --> 07:17:38.065
RESTRAINT. BECAUSE VERY BAD

07:17:38.131 --> 07:17:38.632
THINGS HAPPEN WHEN THEY ARE

07:17:38.699 --> 07:17:41.602
RUSHED TO. AS A SOMETIMES ARE

07:17:41.668 --> 07:17:45.105
DONE IN THIS INSTITUTION. THIS

07:17:45.172 --> 07:17:47.107
IS A MAJOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

07:17:47.174 --> 07:17:49.042
POLICY IT'S NOT JUST LIKE STUFF

07:17:49.109 --> 07:17:52.646
IT'S BIG STEP. WARRANTING IN

07:17:52.713 --> 07:17:55.082
DEPTH HEARINGS. AND POLICY

07:17:55.148 --> 07:17:56.683
COMMITTEE OR COMMITTEES IN BOTH

07:17:56.750 --> 07:17:59.720
HOUSES. THIS CALL OMMITTEES

07:17:59.786 --> 07:18:01.755
SCRUTINY ON THE FLOOR EXTENSIVE

07:18:01.822 --> 07:18:09.262
DEBATE. THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT

07:18:09.329 --> 07:18:11.064
TO EVEN COME CLOSE TO ACHIEVING.

07:18:11.131 --> 07:18:13.967
I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT ALL THE

07:18:14.034 --> 07:18:15.268
MORE REASON TO BE MORE

07:18:15.335 --> 07:18:17.137
RESTRAINT AND RESERVE ABOUT

07:18:17.204 --> 07:18:20.240
TRYING TO JAM MAJOR POLICY. IN

07:18:20.307 --> 07:18:23.644
SUCH A YEAR AND I WOULD ARGUE

07:18:23.710 --> 07:18:25.612
SOME OF THESE POLICIES. COULD

07:18:25.679 --> 07:18:29.149
HAVE WAITED. BUT I THINK SOME

07:18:29.216 --> 07:18:31.385
AND I DO NOT COME TO CONDEMN

07:18:31.451 --> 07:18:32.719
ANYBODY IN THE LEGISLATURE OF

07:18:32.786 --> 07:18:34.354
ADMINISTRATION FOR THIS BUT I

07:18:34.421 --> 07:18:36.023
CALL OTHER PORTIONS AND POWERS

07:18:36.089 --> 07:18:37.524
OUT THERE THIS IS A GREAT

07:18:37.591 --> 07:18:41.061
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO EXPLOIT.

07:18:41.128 --> 07:18:43.130
PURSUE THEIR AGENDA NO IT'S

07:18:43.196 --> 07:18:45.632
BEEN A LONG AGENDA. OVER A

07:18:45.699 --> 07:18:48.335
WHOLE PERIOD OF TIME. AND THE

07:18:48.402 --> 07:18:49.870
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BY

07:18:49.936 --> 07:18:52.639
VIRTUE OF THIS PIECE BY PIECE

07:18:52.706 --> 07:18:55.042
IS BEING TURNED INSIDE OUT. AND

07:18:55.108 --> 07:18:56.576
I WILL ARGUE VOCIFEROUSLY THAT

07:18:56.643 --> 07:18:59.046
WE THE CITIZENS. AND OUR

07:18:59.112 --> 07:19:01.548
FAMILIES ARE NOT SAFER AS A

07:19:01.615 --> 07:19:05.085
PRODUCT OF THIS. OVER THE YEARS

07:19:05.152 --> 07:19:06.353
AND NOW YET AGAIN IN AN

07:19:06.420 --> 07:19:09.222
ACCELERATED WAY BECAUSE THIS

07:19:09.289 --> 07:19:12.459
OPENS THE DOOR TO CALL. CLOSING

07:19:12.526 --> 07:19:14.461
TO MORE PRESENTS. ANDREA

07:19:14.528 --> 07:19:17.497
MILITATED. FORMALLY IN CUSTODY

07:19:17.564 --> 07:19:18.965
IN TREATMENT AND SOME KIND OF

07:19:19.032 --> 07:19:22.569
SUPERVISION. AND SERVING A

07:19:22.636 --> 07:19:25.405
SENTENCE JUST DESSERTS THE

07:19:25.472 --> 07:19:27.074
PUBLIC AND THEIR VICTIMS

07:19:27.140 --> 07:19:29.810
DESERVE SATISFACTION FOR NOW

07:19:29.876 --> 07:19:32.446
ARE GOING TO BE OUT. IN THE

07:19:32.512 --> 07:19:35.882
COMMUNITY. THERE IS NO QUESTION

07:19:35.949 --> 07:19:39.119
THERE'S MORE CRIME. NOW ONE OF

07:19:39.186 --> 07:19:40.187
THE WAYS UNDER REALIGNMENT IT

07:19:40.253 --> 07:19:41.988
WAS HANDLED IS A REDEFINED

07:19:42.055 --> 07:19:44.524
RECIDIVISM. A BOARD OF THE

07:19:44.591 --> 07:19:47.728
STATE RE DEFINED. DUMB THAT

07:19:47.794 --> 07:19:50.297
DOWN IF YOU WILL. THAT'S ALL

07:19:50.363 --> 07:19:52.632
MAJOR POLICY STUFF. THAT KIND

07:19:52.699 --> 07:19:54.167
OF THING HAPPENED NOT IN THE

07:19:54.234 --> 07:19:57.337
LEGISLATURE NOT AND COMMITTEES.

07:19:57.404 --> 07:20:01.475
BUT IN AN OUTSIDE ENTITY. AN

07:20:01.541 --> 07:20:03.477
AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT. I WANT TO

07:20:03.543 --> 07:20:08.081
NAME. THAT HAPPENED. WHAT'S

07:20:08.148 --> 07:20:11.818
LEFT IN OUR PRISONS NOW. WOULD

07:20:11.885 --> 07:20:14.154
BE EVEN TO THE LOCATION

07:20:14.221 --> 07:20:17.858
ADVOCATES TO. CLOSE PRISONS.

07:20:17.924 --> 07:20:18.625
IT'S THE WORST OF THE WORST OF

07:20:18.692 --> 07:20:22.395
SLAPPED. ALL THE COOL LOW LEVEL

07:20:22.462 --> 07:20:26.700
OFFENDERS ARE LONG GONE. AND

07:20:26.767 --> 07:20:28.268
WE'VE TRANSITION IN THE PRISONS

07:20:28.335 --> 07:20:29.936
FROM THE HIGHER LEVELS OF

07:20:30.003 --> 07:20:33.106
SECURITY TO THE MAIN LINE. THE

07:20:33.173 --> 07:20:35.742
VERY MOST DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS

07:20:35.809 --> 07:20:38.411
THAT ARE STILL IN CUSTODY. DO

07:20:38.478 --> 07:20:39.613
YOU THINK SOME OF THEM ARE NOT

07:20:39.679 --> 07:20:41.081
GOING TO SLIP OUT ON THE NATION

07:20:41.148 --> 07:20:43.784
YES THEY ARE. MY POINT IN THAT

07:20:43.850 --> 07:20:47.687
REGARD. IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.

07:20:47.754 --> 07:20:48.188
TO HAVE SOME LEGISLATIVE

07:20:48.255 --> 07:20:50.924
OVERSIGHT. AN IN DEPTH POLICY

07:20:50.991 --> 07:20:52.659
COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND

07:20:52.726 --> 07:20:54.861
DISCUSSIONS ON THIS. AND WE'RE

07:20:54.928 --> 07:20:56.530
IN THE PUBLIC CAN CALM AND

07:20:56.596 --> 07:21:00.534
COMMENT NOW. THIS NEW REGIME

07:21:00.600 --> 07:21:03.970
THAT WE HAVE EXPECTED. I LIKE

07:21:04.037 --> 07:21:05.238
ONE PART OF IT MORE

07:21:05.305 --> 07:21:07.440
CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE OF THE

07:21:07.507 --> 07:21:08.809
CONVENIENCE ARE ABLE COULD

07:21:08.875 --> 07:21:09.709

07:21:14.981 --> 07:21:16.983
IT IN OUR POLICY COMMITTEES

07:21:17.050 --> 07:21:18.451
HERE THEN I THINK IT'S VERY

07:21:18.518 --> 07:21:20.020
UNSATISFACTORY IN THE

07:21:20.086 --> 07:21:21.388
DETERIORATION THE INTEGRITY

07:21:21.454 --> 07:21:26.126
INSTITUTION. IN FORMER TIMES

07:21:26.193 --> 07:21:26.860
POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS HAVE.

07:21:26.927 --> 07:21:29.396
LONG LONG TIME YEAH MAYBE TOO

07:21:29.462 --> 07:21:30.430

PROPER A THOROUGH PUBLIC

07:21:49.082 --> 07:21:51.117
PARTICIPATION THAT'S THE SHORT

07:21:51.184 --> 07:21:53.854
SHRIFT IN THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT

07:21:53.920 --> 07:21:56.323
NOT DO THAT. WE ARE TO DEVOTE

07:21:56.389 --> 07:21:58.859
OUR TIME TO GIVE THE PUBLIC THE

07:21:58.925 --> 07:22:00.694

TO YET WE ARE EXPECTED TO BOTH

07:22:26.052 --> 07:22:27.587
PUT THIS INTO EFFECT AND FORCE

07:22:27.654 --> 07:22:29.990
IT UPON THE PEOPLE. AND EVEN

07:22:30.056 --> 07:22:33.159

NOT GOOD BUSINESS. NOW IN OUR

07:22:50.777 --> 07:22:52.445
CASE HOWEVER COLLEGE CAMPUSES

07:22:52.512 --> 07:22:56.716
JUST FOR A MINUTE. WE DO HAVE

07:22:56.783 --> 07:22:58.718
MORE PROBLEM INDIVIDUALS IN OUR

TRAILER THE TO A PLAN FOR

07:26:58.791 --> 07:27:01.461

07:27:01.528 --> 07:27:04.764
THAT BUDGET SIGNED THE ADMIN OF

07:27:04.831 --> 07:27:05.798
COURSE CHANGE WE HAVE A NEW

GOVERNOR BUT IN THAT PROCESS

07:27:07.267 --> 07:27:08.735
THEY'VE BEEN DEVELOPING THE

07:27:08.801 --> 07:27:13.006
PLAN. AND AS A RESULT IN THIS

07:27:13.072 --> 07:27:15.108

DATES FOR PRISON CLOSURE

WITHIN. A INITIAL DATE AND THEN

07:27:25.451 --> 07:27:27.053
THE SECOND ONE FOLLOWING. IN

07:27:27.120 --> 07:27:28.755
ORDER TO DO THAT THERE HAS TO

07:27:28.821 --> 07:27:32.392
BE POPULATION REDUCTION NOW. AS

07:27:32.458 --> 07:27:34.427
MOST PEOPLE I THINK WOULD AGREE

07:27:34.494 --> 07:27:36.963
THAT TO ACHIEVE POPULATION AND

07:27:37.030 --> 07:27:38.698
WE'RE JUST MEANT JUST BY

07:27:38.765 --> 07:27:41.801
RANDOMLY SAYING X. NUMBER OF

07:27:41.868 --> 07:27:43.269
PEOPLE SHOULD JUST BE RELEASED.

07:27:43.336 --> 07:27:45.672
WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE WISEST

07:27:45.738 --> 07:27:47.473
DECISION REGARDING PUBLIC

07:27:47.540 --> 07:27:50.043
SAFETY SO INSTEAD THERE ARE A

07:27:50.109 --> 07:27:52.879
VARIETY OF MEASURES THAT ARE

07:27:52.946 --> 07:27:54.914
CONSISTENT WITH THE WHOLE SET

07:27:54.981 --> 07:27:57.083
OF BOTH RECIDIVISM REDUCTION

07:27:57.150 --> 07:28:00.954
MEASURES CREDIT- FIFTY SEVEN

07:28:01.020 --> 07:28:04.057
CREDIT ISSUES THINGS LIKE THAT.

07:28:04.123 --> 07:28:07.360
THAT ARE IN THIS PARTICULAR

07:28:07.427 --> 07:28:10.763
TRAILER BILL THAT WILL ASSIST

07:28:10.830 --> 07:28:13.399
ACHIEVING. IN IN A WAY THAT

07:28:13.466 --> 07:28:15.768
PROTECTS PUBLIC SAFETY THE TYPE

07:28:15.835 --> 07:28:17.437
OF POPULATION REDUCTION THAT

07:28:17.503 --> 07:28:20.006
WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE

07:28:20.073 --> 07:28:22.308
THE PRISON CLOSURES WHICH THE

07:28:22.375 --> 07:28:24.544
LEGISLATURE ITSELF FIRST

07:28:24.611 --> 07:28:28.348
DIRECTED. BACK IN TWENTY

07:28:28.414 --> 07:28:31.084
SIXTEEN. AND SO OF THESE ARE.

07:28:31.150 --> 07:28:32.819
ARE FOR THAT PURPOSE AND SO

07:28:32.885 --> 07:28:35.588
THEY DO HAVE A BUDGETARY

07:28:35.655 --> 07:28:37.890
CONNECTION BECAUSE WE WOULD

07:28:37.957 --> 07:28:40.193
FACE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE

07:28:40.260 --> 07:28:41.995
WOULD HAVE TO IF WE WANTED TO

07:28:42.061 --> 07:28:44.163
MEET THESE GOALS OF THE PERSIAN

07:28:44.230 --> 07:28:47.400
CLOSURE BY A CERTAIN DATE. AND

07:28:47.467 --> 07:28:49.535
WE HAD NOT HAD THE APPROPRIATE

07:28:49.602 --> 07:28:51.170
POPULATION REDUCTIONS WHICH I

07:28:51.237 --> 07:28:54.374
WILL NOTE THAT CRIME IS DOWN

07:28:54.440 --> 07:28:55.908
AND THERE ARE NATURAL

07:28:55.975 --> 07:28:57.977
POPULATION REDUCTIONS AS WE'VE

07:28:58.044 --> 07:29:00.880
SEEN OVER TIME. BY TO ENSURE

07:29:00.947 --> 07:29:03.283
THAT WE DO NOT INCREASE

07:29:03.349 --> 07:29:05.685
POPULATION THROUGH RECIDIVISM

07:29:05.752 --> 07:29:07.954
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MEASURES

07:29:08.021 --> 07:29:10.390
IN HERE AROUND THEIR CREDITS

07:29:10.456 --> 07:29:14.927
AND VARIOUS THINGS LIKE THAT.

07:29:14.994 --> 07:29:16.996
THANK YOU SO SKINNER SENATOR

AND I WANT TO THANK MY

07:29:21.601 --> 07:29:22.869
COLLEAGUE FROM TEAM CAME UP

07:29:22.935 --> 07:29:24.504
BECAUSE I THINK HE'S JUSTIFY

07:29:24.570 --> 07:29:26.673
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT WE DID

07:29:26.739 --> 07:29:28.508
FORTY YEARS OF TOUGH ON CRIME

07:29:28.574 --> 07:29:30.243
ANY MAKES ARGUMENT THAT CRIME

07:29:30.310 --> 07:29:32.078
IS UP EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT. IF

07:29:32.145 --> 07:29:33.813
CRIME IS UP AND WE'VE HAD FORTY

07:29:33.880 --> 07:29:35.548
YEARS OF TOUGH TOUGH ON CRIME

07:29:35.615 --> 07:29:36.916
THE WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR

07:29:36.983 --> 07:29:39.085
THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAS BEEN A

07:29:39.152 --> 07:29:40.887
DISMAL FAILURE I WOULD THINK WE

07:29:40.953 --> 07:29:42.655
WOULD ALL AGREE SO I THINK IT'S

07:29:42.722 --> 07:29:44.724
TIME FOR RESET WE HAVE BUILT

07:29:44.791 --> 07:29:46.459
MORE PRISONS IN THE STATE OF

07:29:46.526 --> 07:29:47.660
CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE BUILT.

07:29:47.727 --> 07:29:50.029
UNIVERSITIES AGAIN WE

07:29:50.096 --> 07:29:51.431
INCARCERATE MORE PEOPLE IN

07:29:51.497 --> 07:29:52.899
CALIFORNIA MORE PEOPLE IN THE

07:29:52.965 --> 07:29:54.534
UNITED STATES IN ANY OTHER

07:29:54.600 --> 07:29:56.202
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD YET YOU

07:29:56.269 --> 07:29:58.705
SAY WERE NO SAFER SO WHY WOULD

07:29:58.771 --> 07:30:01.374
WE WANT TO REASSESS HOW IT IS

07:30:01.441 --> 07:30:03.576
THAT WE ADDRESS CRIMINAL

07:30:03.643 --> 07:30:05.978
JUSTICE HERE IN THE STATE HOW

07:30:06.045 --> 07:30:07.447
DO WE DRESS CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN

07:30:07.513 --> 07:30:08.681
THIS NATION. THE CLOSURE

07:30:08.748 --> 07:30:10.283
PRISONS IT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY

07:30:10.350 --> 07:30:11.884
FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF US

07:30:11.951 --> 07:30:14.487
INCARCERATING PEOPLE DOES NOT

07:30:14.554 --> 07:30:17.056
REDUCE CRIME ESPECIALLY WHEN

07:30:17.123 --> 07:30:18.391
THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS WHO'VE

07:30:18.458 --> 07:30:18.958
BEEN INCARCERATED ARE BLACK

07:30:19.025 --> 07:30:20.693
BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AGAIN

07:30:20.760 --> 07:30:22.995

07:30:23.062 --> 07:30:26.899
TIMES FALSELY ACCUSED. AND

07:30:26.966 --> 07:30:28.935
FALSELY PROSECUTE. AND REALITY.

07:30:29.001 --> 07:30:31.037
SO I THINK YOU MADE A GREAT

07:30:31.104 --> 07:30:33.406
ARGUMENT WHY WE SHOULD TAKE

07:30:33.473 --> 07:30:34.574
ANOTHER APPROACH I THINK THIS

07:30:34.640 --> 07:30:36.576
BILL IS THE RIGHT MEASURE AT

07:30:36.642 --> 07:30:40.413

ENERGY WHEN IT'S CLEAN TO.

08:24:58.434 --> 08:25:02.972
OBVIOUSLY OTIS BUT WE HAVE

08:25:03.039 --> 08:25:03.740
PLENTY OF SOLAR BACK WE HAVE

08:25:03.806 --> 08:25:05.608
MORE SOLAR WE CAN POSSIBLY

08:25:05.675 --> 08:25:08.945

LOAD OUR POWER TO OTHER STATES

08:25:14.384 --> 08:25:15.118
BECAUSE WHEN THE SUN SHINING

08:25:15.184 --> 08:25:16.819
WE'RE CREATING TOO MUCH POWER

08:25:16.886 --> 08:25:19.088
AND UNTIL STORAGE EITHER

08:25:19.155 --> 08:25:21.224

08:25:33.336 --> 08:25:35.738
OVER PRODUCING. THIS BILL IS X.

08:25:35.805 --> 08:25:38.441
IS IT IS EXPECTING TO SEE THIS

08:25:38.508 --> 08:25:40.209
BUT ROLE COMING AFFECTING HIS

08:25:40.276 --> 08:25:44.113
HEDGING THAT THEY'LL STILL GET.

08:25:44.180 --> 08:25:46.749
THE TAX INCENTIVE WHY IN THE

08:25:46.816 --> 08:25:48.518
WORLD WE INCENTIVIZE OF THE WE

08:25:48.584 --> 08:25:50.586
HAVE TOO MUCH UP IS BECAUSE THE

08:25:50.653 --> 08:25:52.789
LOBBY IS VERY POWERFUL IN THIS

08:25:52.855 --> 08:25:55.324
AREA. THE RATE PAYERS OF

08:25:55.391 --> 08:25:56.926
CALIFORNIA ARE GETTING THE

08:25:56.993 --> 08:25:58.895
SHORT END OF THE DEAL. AT THE

08:25:58.961 --> 08:26:00.196
SAME TIME WE SHOULD BE TALKING

08:26:00.263 --> 08:26:02.365
ABOUT STORAGE THE ONLY WAY

08:26:02.432 --> 08:26:04.100
WE'RE EVER GOING TO REALLY DO A

08:26:04.167 --> 08:26:06.169
GOOD JOB OF GOING GREEN AND

08:26:06.235 --> 08:26:08.871
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A

08:26:08.938 --> 08:26:09.572
BALANCE IS UNTIL WE HAVE

08:26:09.639 --> 08:26:11.774
STORAGE. IS SO FOR THOSE

08:26:11.841 --> 08:26:12.975
REASONS I OPPOSE THIS PIECE

08:26:13.042 --> 08:26:15.511
LEGISLATION SECONDLY IT IS NOT

08:26:15.578 --> 08:26:16.713
FITTING BE IN THIS BUDGET

08:26:16.779 --> 08:26:18.681

WHO GET THE TAX CREDITS FROM

08:26:27.557 --> 08:26:28.991
THIS SO FOR THOSE REASONS I

08:26:29.058 --> 08:26:30.993
URGE A NO VOTE IN ON THE BEHALF

08:26:31.060 --> 08:26:32.428
OF THE RATE PAYERS OF

08:26:32.495 --> 08:26:37.266

FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT HAS

08:27:13.903 --> 08:27:16.339

WOULD DEEM UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

08:27:33.890 --> 08:27:36.959
MAYBE AS A FOLLOW UP. YOU MAY

08:27:37.026 --> 08:27:39.061

BUT MIGHT MY CONCERN REALLY IS

08:28:11.794 --> 08:28:14.163
I THINK THIS IS BEING SET UP

FOR A LEGAL CHALLENGE AND I

08:28:16.432 --> 08:28:21.404
THINK MY COLLEAGUE BEFORE HAD

INDICATED THAT. THIS IS

08:28:23.539 --> 08:28:25.174

CANARY IN THE COAL MINE HERE

08:28:35.985 --> 08:28:37.587

08:28:37.653 --> 08:28:39.222
CHALLENGE OF THIS MOVES FORWARD

08:28:39.288 --> 08:28:41.123

COURT CAN CHALLENGE WHATEVER

08:28:59.008 --> 08:29:00.209

08:44:50.458 --> 08:44:53.128
NEEDS TO BE DONE TO BE ABLE TO

08:44:53.195 --> 08:44:55.797
DISTRIBUTE THESE MONIES TO THE

08:44:55.864 --> 08:44:59.334
UNEMPLOYED IN A MUCH MORE

08:44:59.401 --> 08:45:01.403
EFFICIENT WAY. THAN WHAT'S

08:45:01.469 --> 08:45:04.339
BEING DONE NOW- I THINK WE'VE

08:45:04.406 --> 08:45:06.575
ALL BEEN VERY PATIENT. ABOUT

08:45:06.641 --> 08:45:09.211
HOW OF THE PACE WITH WHICH THIS

08:45:09.277 --> 08:45:11.680
IS BEING DONE. BUT I MUST SAY I

08:45:11.746 --> 08:45:13.181
SAID THIS YESTERDAY IN THE

08:45:13.248 --> 08:45:16.751
COMMITTEE. THAT THE PRESSURE

08:45:16.818 --> 08:45:20.255
THAT- I KNOW JUST AS AN EXAMPLE

08:45:20.322 --> 08:45:21.756
OUR STAFF IS GOING THROUGH

08:45:21.823 --> 08:45:24.726
EVERY SINGLE DAY. HEARING THE

08:45:24.793 --> 08:45:28.196
ANGER THE FRUSTRATION- THE

08:45:28.263 --> 08:45:29.898
PASSION WITH WHICH THE CALLS

08:45:29.965 --> 08:45:32.367
ARE COMING IN. IS SOMETHING

08:45:32.434 --> 08:45:33.768
THAT EIGHT YOU KNOW IS BECOMING

08:45:33.835 --> 08:45:37.439
VERY UNBEARABLE SO I KNOW THE

08:45:37.505 --> 08:45:40.041
PRESSURE IS ON THE AGENCIES BUT

08:45:40.108 --> 08:45:41.776
MORE HAS TO BE DONE SOMETHING

08:45:41.843 --> 08:45:43.612
DIFFERENT HAS TO BE DONE

08:45:43.678 --> 08:45:45.146
BECAUSE WE'RE SO MANY MONTHS

08:45:45.213 --> 08:45:47.949
AFTER THIS- AFTER THEY ALL

08:45:48.016 --> 08:45:49.551
STARTED LOSING THEIR JOB SO

08:45:49.618 --> 08:45:52.020
THAT'S MY ONLY COMMENT OF ABOUT

08:45:52.087 --> 08:45:53.521
MAKING SURE THAT WE DO

08:45:53.588 --> 08:45:55.724
SOMETHING. REALLY DIFFERENT

08:45:55.790 --> 08:45:57.392
FROM WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW

08:45:57.459 --> 08:46:04.599
THANK YOU. SENATOR MORLOCK

08:46:04.666 --> 08:46:05.867
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR

08:46:05.934 --> 08:46:07.435
YEAH I HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ON

08:46:07.502 --> 08:46:09.738
THIS LAST NIGHT AT THE BUDGET

08:46:09.804 --> 08:46:13.041
IS TO REVIEW COMMITTEE AND-

08:46:13.108 --> 08:46:13.909
GOING BACK TO MY EARLY CAREER I

08:46:13.975 --> 08:46:15.510
DID PREPARE A LOT OF PAYROLL

08:46:15.577 --> 08:46:19.915
TAX RETURNS- THERE ARE TWO-

08:46:19.981 --> 08:46:22.951
UNEMPLOYMENT TAX. CATEGORIES

08:46:23.018 --> 08:46:25.587
SAID EMPLOYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE

08:46:25.654 --> 08:46:26.888
FOR ONE IS STATE UNEMPLOYMENT

08:46:26.955 --> 08:46:28.690
INSURANCE THE OTHERS VIEW THE-

08:46:28.757 --> 08:46:29.958
AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

08:46:30.025 --> 08:46:31.960
COMMITTEE WAS ACCURATE AND HOW

08:46:32.027 --> 08:46:34.162
CUTE IS CALCULATED TO FORTY TWO

08:46:34.229 --> 08:46:35.697
DOLLARS PER EMPLOYEE. IF THEY

08:46:35.764 --> 08:46:37.132
ARE AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

08:46:37.198 --> 08:46:39.134
OR MORE YEAR. WE WERE

08:46:39.200 --> 08:46:41.937
INSTRUCTED LAST NIGHT. THAT THE

08:46:42.003 --> 08:46:43.038
S. YOU WHY THE STATE

08:46:43.104 --> 08:46:45.307
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WOULD

08:46:45.373 --> 08:46:47.208
THE RATES WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED

08:46:47.275 --> 08:46:50.312
BECAUSE- THE LAYOFFS WERE DUE

08:46:50.378 --> 08:46:52.547
TO CO OF IT AND NOT. BECAUSE OF

08:46:52.614 --> 08:46:54.582
OTHER. CIRCUMSTANCES SO

08:46:54.649 --> 08:46:57.953
EMPLOYERS WOULD. NOT BE

08:46:58.019 --> 08:47:01.323
PENALIZED AND TO- SHOULD THIS

08:47:01.389 --> 08:47:06.294
STATE. TAKE THE SAME ROAD. AS

08:47:06.361 --> 08:47:07.762
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION

08:47:07.829 --> 08:47:09.130
WHICH DID NOT PAY OFF THE

08:47:09.197 --> 08:47:10.932
FEUDAL LOANS RIGHT AWAY SO

08:47:10.999 --> 08:47:13.201
EMPLOYERS HAD TO PAY THE

08:47:13.268 --> 08:47:13.768
HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN PER

08:47:13.835 --> 08:47:18.340
EMPLOYEE THAT WOULD NOT. TAKE

08:47:18.406 --> 08:47:21.142
AFFECT UNTIL TWO YEARS AFTER WE

08:47:21.209 --> 08:47:22.477
HAD ESTABLISHED A LOAN BALANCE

08:47:22.544 --> 08:47:24.612
THAT WAS ON PAID SO WE STILL

08:47:24.679 --> 08:47:26.147
HAVE SOME BREATHING ROOM HERE

08:47:26.214 --> 08:47:27.649

FROM BAKERSFIELD CONFUSED THE

08:47:55.844 --> 08:47:57.412
ISSUE A LITTLE BIT AND I WANT

08:47:57.479 --> 08:47:58.680
TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT I

08:47:58.747 --> 08:48:01.616
ASK OUR STAFF AND I WENT TO THE

08:48:01.683 --> 08:48:02.250
BUDGETARY WHO I WOULD JUST LIKE

08:48:02.317 --> 08:48:04.052

EXCELLENT JOB. AND I WANT TO

COMMEND YOU FOR THAT. IN MY

08:48:11.960 --> 08:48:14.095
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THIS

08:48:14.162 --> 08:48:14.963
WILL BE PICKED UP BY THE

08:48:15.030 --> 08:48:16.264
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE WILL NOT

08:48:16.331 --> 08:48:19.067
BE LIKE IT WAS. IN TWO THOUSAND

08:48:19.134 --> 08:48:21.136
EIGHT. FOR AND I WAS I'M AN

08:48:21.202 --> 08:48:23.038
EMPLOYER SAW THIS HAPPEN TO ME

08:48:23.104 --> 08:48:26.041
AS WELL AS IT DID. THE MEMBER

08:48:26.107 --> 08:48:26.674
FROM BAKERSFIELD THAT WE HAD TO

08:48:26.741 --> 08:48:29.878
PAY. LITERALLY UNTIL TWO

08:48:29.944 --> 08:48:31.079
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

08:48:31.146 --> 08:48:32.847
WE JUST FINISHED PAYING OFF.

08:48:32.914 --> 08:48:35.984
THE UNEMPLOYMENT DEBT. THAT THE

08:48:36.051 --> 08:48:37.919
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BORROWED.

08:48:37.986 --> 08:48:40.422
AGAINST THE LITTLE LONG LONG

08:48:40.488 --> 08:48:42.624
TERM OF UNEMPLOYMENT THE PEOPLE

08:48:42.690 --> 08:48:44.225
WERE ABLE TO CLASS SO. I

08:48:44.292 --> 08:48:46.361
BELIEVE UNDER THIS SCENARIO. IT

08:48:46.428 --> 08:48:47.595
WILL BE BACK FILLED BY THE

08:48:47.662 --> 08:48:49.364
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ONE

08:48:49.431 --> 08:48:50.265
OTHER ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO

08:48:50.331 --> 08:48:52.801
ADD. WHICH I TALK WHICH I ASKED

08:48:52.867 --> 08:48:54.035
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LAST

08:48:54.102 --> 08:48:56.037
NIGHT WHICH IS VERY CRUCIAL TO

08:48:56.104 --> 08:48:58.173
BUSINESS OWNERS. WHO ARE TRYING

08:48:58.239 --> 08:49:00.008
TO HIRE THEIR EMPLOYEES. WHEN

08:49:00.075 --> 08:49:01.843
THEY'RE GETTING FOUR HUNDRED

08:49:01.910 --> 08:49:03.411
FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK NOT ONLY

08:49:03.478 --> 08:49:04.446
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

08:49:04.512 --> 08:49:06.214
BUT SIX HUNDRED. FROM THE

08:49:06.281 --> 08:49:07.115
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE'S

08:49:07.182 --> 08:49:09.017
REALLY NO REASON FOR THEM IN

08:49:09.084 --> 08:49:10.852
SOME CASES TO GO BACK TO WORK

08:49:10.919 --> 08:49:11.986
BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING

08:49:12.053 --> 08:49:14.589
MORE MONEY- ON UNEMPLOYMENT

08:49:14.656 --> 08:49:16.825
THAN THEY WOULD BE. IF THEY

08:49:16.891 --> 08:49:19.627
WERE WORKING. IF YOU OFFER YOUR

08:49:19.694 --> 08:49:21.596
JOB BACK AS AN EMPLOYER.

08:49:21.663 --> 08:49:22.997
THEY'RE REQUIRED TO TAKE THAT

08:49:23.064 --> 08:49:24.933
JOB AND IF THEY DON'T. THEN

08:49:24.999 --> 08:49:26.267
THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE

08:49:26.334 --> 08:49:27.869
UNEMPLOYED. SKEWS ME

08:49:27.936 --> 08:49:29.270
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WHICH IS

08:49:29.337 --> 08:49:30.572
CRUCIAL WE WANT TO GET THEM

08:49:30.638 --> 08:49:32.173
BACK TO WORK. OBVIOUSLY THEY

08:49:32.240 --> 08:49:33.541
MAY BE TAKING A PAY CUT BUT

08:49:33.608 --> 08:49:34.742
THAT'S TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE

08:49:34.809 --> 08:49:37.045
PAYING THAT UNEMPLOYMENT AND

08:49:37.112 --> 08:49:37.912
IT'S ALSO EMPLOYERS THAT ARE

08:49:37.979 --> 08:49:40.415
PAYING IT. SO I ENCOURAGE THOSE

08:49:40.482 --> 08:49:41.316
BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE TRYING

08:49:41.382 --> 08:49:43.952
TO GET BACK STARTED. TO GET IN

08:49:44.018 --> 08:49:45.587
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;ONTACT WITH THOSE EMPLOYEES&lt;/c&gt;</u>

08:49:45.653 --> 08:49:46.955
AND IF THEY DON'T TAKE THEIR

08:49:47.021 --> 08:49:48.556
JOB BACK REPORT INTO THE

08:49:48.623 --> 08:49:49.924
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BECAUSE

08:49:49.991 --> 08:49:51.826
IT'S ALL OF US THAT ARE PAYING-

08:49:51.893 --> 08:49:53.795
THOSE FEES. SO I WILL BE

08:49:53.862 --> 08:49:55.730
SUPPORTING THE LEGISLATION I

08:49:55.797 --> 08:49:56.965
BELIEVE WE HAVE IT IRONED OUT

08:49:57.031 --> 08:49:58.500
RIGHT AND THIS IS CRITICAL FOR

08:49:58.566 --> 08:49:59.667
CALIFORNIA TO GET MOVING IN THE

08:49:59.734 --> 08:50:01.002

TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT.

08:50:20.221 --> 08:50:22.223

PRODUCT. THIS WAS A BUDGET THAT

09:10:25.425 --> 09:10:29.029
STARTED OUT WITH GREAT HOPE. I

09:10:29.096 --> 09:10:30.130
WAS VERY PLEASED WITH SOME

09:10:30.197 --> 09:10:32.132
ELEMENTS AS I SPOKE THAT DAY

09:10:32.199 --> 09:10:33.800
WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS BUDGET OF

09:10:33.867 --> 09:10:34.501
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

09:10:34.568 --> 09:10:36.570
PARTICULAR IS TOWED AWAY CHOSE

09:10:36.636 --> 09:10:38.472
TO DEAL AND SUCH A CONSTRUCTIVE

09:10:38.538 --> 09:10:41.174
AND PROBLEM SOLVING AND LONG

09:10:41.241 --> 09:10:43.310

WELL ALL OF OUR HOPES ALONG THE

09:10:44.811 --> 09:10:48.615
WAY OF KIND OF. WERE DERAILED.

09:10:48.682 --> 09:10:53.320
OF GREAT MAGNITUDE UNDERSTOOD.

09:10:53.387 --> 09:10:55.489
BUT THE DIFFICULTY THAT I'VE

09:10:55.555 --> 09:10:57.057
HAD AND I DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT

09:10:57.124 --> 09:10:59.793
THE- SHORTENING UP OF THE

09:10:59.860 --> 09:11:02.062
BUDGET PROCESS. I'D BE MULLIN

09:11:02.129 --> 09:11:05.198
RIGHT. AND I DO ARGUE THAT IT'S

09:11:05.265 --> 09:11:06.466
DONE A DISSERVICE BECAUSE WE

09:11:06.533 --> 09:11:08.502
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO IN DEPTH

09:11:08.568 --> 09:11:10.404
SCRUTINIZE THE BUDGET INPUT THE

09:11:10.470 --> 09:11:13.707
BUDGET AS WE NORMALLY COULD.

09:11:13.774 --> 09:11:15.842
AND THE SUBCOMMITTEES IS THE

09:11:15.909 --> 09:11:18.078
ONE PLACE FOR. THE MINORITY

09:11:18.145 --> 09:11:21.181
PARTY COULD HAVE SOME GOOD

09:11:21.248 --> 09:11:24.151
FAITH DISCUSSIONS NEGOTIATIONS

09:11:24.217 --> 09:11:26.887
AND RESOLUTIONS AND AGREEMENTS.

09:11:26.953 --> 09:11:28.055
AS I'VE SAID HERE BEFORE QUITE

09:11:28.121 --> 09:11:30.624
FRANKLY AND HAVING SAID ON

09:11:30.690 --> 09:11:33.293
SUBCOMMITTEES FOR MANY YEARS AS

09:11:33.360 --> 09:11:35.595
WE VOTE ITEM BY ITEM IN OUR

09:11:35.662 --> 09:11:38.231
SUBCOMMITTEES. MORE OFTEN THAN

09:11:38.298 --> 09:11:41.301
NOT. THE MAJORITY IN THE

09:11:41.368 --> 09:11:42.736
MINORITY PARTY MEMBERS ARE IN

09:11:42.803 --> 09:11:45.839
AGREEMENT. THAT HAS ALWAYS FELT

09:11:45.906 --> 09:11:50.644
GOOD. THEY'RE ALWAYS FELT GOOD.

09:11:50.710 --> 09:11:53.580
IN YEARS PAST ONE. I BECAME A

09:11:53.647 --> 09:11:56.416
MEMBER OF THE BIG FIVE. NOW I

09:11:56.483 --> 09:11:58.118
HAVE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE FUNNY

09:11:58.185 --> 09:12:00.487
STORY ABOUT THAT THOUGH. WHEN I

09:12:00.554 --> 09:12:03.290
CAME HERE. I FIGURED THAT. YOU

09:12:03.356 --> 09:12:04.691
KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE

09:12:04.758 --> 09:12:05.926
AFFECTED YOU HAD TO GET ON. THE

09:12:05.992 --> 09:12:09.729
BUDGET COMMITTEE. THE END SO I

09:12:09.796 --> 09:12:12.132
GOT ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE.

09:12:12.199 --> 09:12:12.599
AND I DIDN'T FEEL VERY

09:12:12.666 --> 09:12:15.969
EFFECTIVE. SO IN A BECAME A

09:12:16.036 --> 09:12:18.238
MEMBER OF THE BIG FIVE. AND

09:12:18.305 --> 09:12:19.773
THEN I THOUGHT BOY I'M REALLY

09:12:19.840 --> 09:12:22.542
GOING TO BE AFFECTED NOW. WELL

09:12:22.609 --> 09:12:24.377
I FOUND OUT IT WASN'T QUITE AS

09:12:24.444 --> 09:12:26.213
BIG A DEAL BUT ON THE OTHER

09:12:26.279 --> 09:12:29.983
HAND THAT WAS A- CONSTRUCT.

09:12:30.050 --> 09:12:30.584
UNDER GOVERNOR NATION AT THE

09:12:30.650 --> 09:12:32.919
TIME. OR BY THE BIG FIVE

09:12:32.986 --> 09:12:34.821
CONVENE ONLY ON THE MOST

09:12:34.888 --> 09:12:38.225
IMPORTANT ISSUES. NOT AS ONE

09:12:38.291 --> 09:12:38.792
YEAR WE HAD THE WHOLE BUDGET

09:12:38.859 --> 09:12:44.331
DONE. THEN THE BIG FIVE BUT

09:12:44.397 --> 09:12:46.533
THEN FINALLY HAD TO CONCLUDE.

09:12:46.600 --> 09:12:48.401
AT THE END WHEN ASKED WHAT WORD

09:12:48.468 --> 09:12:52.038
IS A BUDGET FINALLY GET DONE. I

09:12:52.105 --> 09:12:53.773
SAID WELL IT'S A MATTER OF

09:12:53.840 --> 09:12:55.709
FATIGUE. WHEN NOBODY GETS TIRED

09:12:55.775 --> 09:12:58.478
ENOUGH. NOW THAT'S KIND OF A

09:12:58.545 --> 09:13:00.580
FACETIOUS WAY TO PUT IT. BUT

09:13:00.647 --> 09:13:03.016
SOMETIMES THE EXHAUSTION WEARS

09:13:03.083 --> 09:13:07.320
YOU DOWN. WHEN YOU REACH A DEAL.

09:13:07.387 --> 09:13:10.023
SO THIS YEAR FOR SPOKE WELL AND

09:13:10.090 --> 09:13:11.691
EVEN LAST YEAR TO IT'S SORT OF

09:13:11.758 --> 09:13:15.529
BECOME A PARTY OF THE BIG THREE.

09:13:15.595 --> 09:13:18.164
AND MINORITY PARTY. I STILL

09:13:18.231 --> 09:13:20.300

COMMITTEE. EXHAUSTING BUT

09:13:44.591 --> 09:13:45.992
FRUITFUL AND PRODUCTIVE AND A

09:13:46.059 --> 09:13:50.997

WAYSIDE TOO AND I GUESS I CAN

LIKE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN.

09:15:34.267 --> 09:15:35.468
THESE ARE IN PERFECT TIMES OF

09:15:35.535 --> 09:15:36.736
THIS IS NAMED PERFECT BUDGET

09:15:36.803 --> 09:15:38.705
PROCESS AND WE'RE DOING OUR

09:15:38.772 --> 09:15:40.740
BEST EVEN WHEN WE HAVE STRONG

09:15:40.807 --> 09:15:42.642
PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS BUT I

09:15:42.709 --> 09:15:45.178
WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF THE

09:15:45.245 --> 09:15:48.448
THINGS THAT IS TRULY BIPARTISAN.

09:15:48.515 --> 09:15:52.652
AND ULTIMATELY BICAMERAL IS ALL

09:15:52.719 --> 09:15:53.953
OF US APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE

09:15:54.020 --> 09:15:57.724
OF EDUCATION. AND IN THIS

09:15:57.791 --> 09:15:58.258
PARTICULAR INSTANCE HIGHER

09:15:58.324 --> 09:16:02.162
EDUCATION. AND I KNOW THAT WE

09:16:02.228 --> 09:16:03.997
WENT FROM- TWENTY TWENTY TWO

09:16:04.064 --> 09:16:06.066
BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS- YEAR

09:16:06.132 --> 09:16:08.468
AND A HALF AGO- IN NOW WE'RE

09:16:08.535 --> 09:16:12.706
DOWN TO FIFTY FOUR- BEFORE THE

09:16:12.772 --> 09:16:14.774
BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS BUT ONE

09:16:14.841 --> 09:16:17.243
THING THAT I'M REALLY HOPEFUL

09:16:17.310 --> 09:16:17.811
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RE

09:16:17.877 --> 09:16:20.480
VISIT. OUR THE CUTS TO SEE

09:16:20.547 --> 09:16:25.018
ISSUE UC AND CSU IN PARTICULAR.

09:16:25.085 --> 09:16:29.456
I THINK THESE INSTITUTIONS.

09:16:29.522 --> 09:16:30.924
PART TAKING SUCH ADDRESS

09:16:30.990 --> 09:16:33.393
DRAMATIC HIT BECAUSE THEY DON'T

09:16:33.460 --> 09:16:35.328
KNOW THE FULL COST OF GOING

09:16:35.395 --> 09:16:37.297
REMOTE THEY DON'T KNOW THE FULL

09:16:37.363 --> 09:16:39.265
ATTRITION RATE OF STUDENTS WHO

09:16:39.332 --> 09:16:40.734
MAY NOT RETURN IN RE

09:16:40.800 --> 09:16:43.903
MATRICULATED ARE AND WHEN YOU

09:16:43.970 --> 09:16:46.639
LOOK AT THE INDEBTEDNESS- IN

09:16:46.706 --> 09:16:47.974
THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE

09:16:48.041 --> 09:16:50.443
SCHOOLS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

09:16:50.510 --> 09:16:51.544
THAT AT SOME POINT WHETHER BE A

09:16:51.611 --> 09:16:54.080
TRAILER- IN IN- THE COMING

09:16:54.147 --> 09:16:56.449
MONTHS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

09:16:56.516 --> 09:16:58.451
FINDING WAYS BECAUSE- WE'RE

09:16:58.518 --> 09:17:00.453
HOPEFUL THAT THE FEDS COME IN.

09:17:00.520 --> 09:17:02.489
AND ALLOW US DOLLARS THAT WOULD

09:17:02.555 --> 09:17:04.691
TO OFFSET THESE LOSSES OR THESE

09:17:04.758 --> 09:17:07.227
REDUCTIONS IN THE BUDGET. BUT

09:17:07.293 --> 09:17:07.794
LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY DON'T

09:17:07.861 --> 09:17:10.296
HAPPEN. I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE

09:17:10.363 --> 09:17:11.931
CERTAIN THAT AS WE APPRECIATE

09:17:11.998 --> 09:17:13.800
HIGHER EDUCATION AS ONE THE

09:17:13.867 --> 09:17:16.436
GREAT ECONOMIC ENGINES. OF OUR

09:17:16.503 --> 09:17:19.172
STATE. CREATING ALL THE

09:17:19.239 --> 09:17:20.440
OPPORTUNITIES FOR VERTICAL

09:17:20.507 --> 09:17:22.509
ADVANCEMENT FOR MINORITY

09:17:22.575 --> 09:17:24.878
PARTIES ASSUME ON MINORITIES

09:17:24.944 --> 09:17:26.412
AND- IN THOSE THAT WE TALK

09:17:26.479 --> 09:17:28.882
ABOUT AS BEING DISENFRANCHISED

09:17:28.948 --> 09:17:31.017
I THINK THIS NEEDS TO REMAIN

09:17:31.084 --> 09:17:33.286
TOP OF MIND. MOVING FORWARD IF

09:17:33.353 --> 09:17:34.888
WE DO NOT GET FEDERAL FUNDING I

09:17:34.954 --> 09:17:36.589
WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT

09:17:36.656 --> 09:17:38.825
WE RE VISIT THE BUDGET TO SEE

09:17:38.892 --> 09:17:40.994
ISSUE SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY ARE.

09:17:41.060 --> 09:17:44.097
GOING TO BE IN DESPERATE NEED.
