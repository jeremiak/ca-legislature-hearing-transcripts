AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING ON WHICH. DO WE HAVE. MR- WE HAVE THE EMBARK CDCR. THIS IS BATTLING A PLAGUE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OFFICE OF THE SCHOOL SERVICES I BELIEVE MISTER BORGES'S HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES JOINING- I CAN GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW- HOWEVER WHICH WOULD BE A DISCUSSION I BELIEVE WILL NEED TO. WAIT FOR HIM TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES BUT I CAN DO PER I CAN PROVIDE A QUICK OVERVIEW STATEMENT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE HOW WE WILL GO AHEAD AND WAIT- MISTER CLARK. YEAH. YEAH MARKERS ARE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER. MICHAEL PACKER. OKAY. WELL FEET EASIER TRIES TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR- TECHNICAL ISSUES TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF TIME WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA GO OUT OF ORDER IN THE AGENDA AND IF THE PANELISTS ALREADY MOVED TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. WHICH IS DNA ID FUND RESTORATION. GOOD AFTERNOON- MADAM CHAIR- AND THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ASHLEY HARPER BUDGET OFFICER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A ONE TIME TECHNICAL REVENUE BACK FILL OF FORTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN DNA I. D. FUND REVENUES TO SUPPORT DOJ'S BUREAU FORENSIC SERVICES WHICH PROVIDES STATEWIDE FORENSIC LABORATORY OPERATION. THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THAT DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO AUGMENT THE APPROPRIATION SHOULD FUNDS BE INSUFFICIENT TO DUE TO CONTINUED REVENUE DECLINES REVENUES TO THE DEMANDING FUND HAVE DECREASED FROM SIXTY NINE MILLION IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN TO THIRTY TWO MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE I WITH THE TOTAL FUNDING NEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION TO SUPPORT THE BUREAU'S CURRENT LEVEL. OF STATEWIDE PUBLIC SAFETY FORENSICS SERVICES FUND IS ANTICIPATED TO IN CURRENT OPERATIONAL SHORTFALL OF FORTY SIX MILLION AND POSSIBLY MORE DEPENDING ON THE FUTURE OF JEANNIE ID FIND REVENUES ABSENT REVENUE BACKFILL SOLUTION IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THE FUND WILL BE INSOLVENT- PURSUANT TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT I DO J. RECENTLY SUBMITTED A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH OUTLINED POTENTIAL FUTURE FUNDING OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. I DO J. REMAINS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY A PERMANENT FUNDING SOLUTION FOR THIS CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY WORK LOOK AT WITH THAT MYSELF AND BARRY MILLER OUR CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL. FOR ANY DELAY WITH A LOT ANALYST'S OFFICE- WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE STATE FUNDS THAT IS IMPACTED BY DECLINING CRIMINAL FINING PEOPLE EVAN IS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT IN PRIOR HEARINGS. SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THIS FUND WE ACTUALLY RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PARTIALLY SUPPORT BFS. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND TO PROVIDE DOJ WITH DIRECTION ON HOW MUCH OF BFS OPERATIONS- SHOULD BE COMING FROM LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH AS A THIRD OR A HALF. AND SO THIS WOULD GENERALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND THAT WOULD BE NEEDED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO BACK FILL THIS FINE INTO SUPPORT. BFS ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS IS MORE EQUITABLE THAN THE EXISTING SYSTEM IN WHICH CERTAIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE RECEIVING SERVICES AT NO CHARGE WHILE OTHER. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE PAYING TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN LABORATORIES. SINCE THE AGENCIES RECEIVING BFS SERVICES WOULD NOW BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR A PORTION OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE THEM WITH GREATER INCENTIVE TO PRIORITIZE THE WORKLOAD THAT'S BEING SENT TO DOJ. DOJ WOULD STILL HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN DETERMINING HOW TO CALCULATE EACH AGENCIES SHARE BASED ON THE SERVICES THAT IT RECEIVES AND CAN CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING EQUITY CONCERNS SIZE OF AGENCY- THE TYPE OF SERVICES PROVIDED AS WELL AS THE SPEED OF THE SERVICE. WE ARE RECOMMENDING A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE TO PROVIDE- TIME FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK AS WELL AS TO ALLOW FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO ADAPT TO THAT. SO IN LINE WITH THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MAINTAIN SERVICES IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT SHIFTED TO THIS NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK BEGINNING AT TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU. AND THIS IS KEVIN CLARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO FOR NO SIGNIFICANT FURTHER COM. COMMENTS AT THIS TIME OTHERWISE OTHER THAN NOTING THAT. DOJ JUST RECENTLY RELEASED THE REPORT ON MARCH TENTH DETAILING SIX UNIQUE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WITHIN THE BUREAU. OF FORENSIC SERVICES AND SO ARE WE FINANCIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TRADEOFFS OF EACH APPROACH- IN OUR CONTINUING AND HAPPY TO HAVE. CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING. WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PARLIAMENT- OKAY THANK YOU ARE JUST JUST QUICKLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING THAT WE HAVE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON ALLELES RECOMMENDATION- TO HAVE. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- PAY A PORTION OF THESE COST. YEAH WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING ALL OF THE OPTIONS- AND NOT- NOT PREPARED SAID ABOUT A SPECIFIC PATH FORWARD AT THIS TIME BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN LA- AND THAT'S APARTMENT. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MAKE MAKE MUCH SENSE FOR THE BOARD. THE END AND THEN JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS TRYING TO FIND A LONG TERM SOLUTION SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THESE CONTINUOUS. THAT FILLS. YEAH WE'RE WE'RE OPEN SAID VIOLATING ALL OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THE SOLVENCY THE INSOLVENCY ISSUE IN THAT THE FUNDS. ARE AND THEN JUST TO BE CARE FOR MYSELF I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU S. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND COME BACK TO US. THAT WE FIND A PERMANENT FIX AND NOT JUST KEEP PASSING THIS ON THE BUCKET FILLS THE RESPONSIBLE TO KNOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM. AND NOT ADDRESS THAT- PROPERLY AND SO WHETHER IT'S- ALLELES RECOMMENDATION ARE ONE OF THE OTHER SIX THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU I DO HOPE WE COME UP WITH A LONG TERM STRATEGY SOONER THAN LATER. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT. THE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON ITEM NUMBER FOUR WERE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CLOSE OFF THAT I DON'T FOR NOW- WE'RE NOT AGAIN WANTED TO GETTING VOTES TODAY ON ANYTHING SO. FAR I MEAN THAT WOULD BE WILL STAY OPEN WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE OFF THE DISCUSSION ONLY- WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND RETURN TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE. E DO HAVE. CDC ARE I THINK TRAINING THIS VIA TELEPHONE. YES MADAM CHAIR- MY NAME IS DAN BORGEN THE DIRECTOR OF THE FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DIVISION FOR- THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO JOIN THROUGH WEBEX I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE ASSEMBLY TECHNICAL STAFF- WENT THROUGH TO TRY TO GET ME- JOINED IN. I'LL GO AHEAD AND START PRESENT ON THE- THE I. ISSUE NUMBER ONE- THE MASTER PLAN ANNUAL REPORT KNOWN BY THE ACRONYM EMPOWER. ANNUALLY PROVIDES INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE ON CURRENT PROJECTS. RECENTLY COMPLETED PROJECTS AND PROJECTS THAT ARE REQUESTING FUNDING FOR EITHER BUDGET YEAR OR BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE. THE EMPIRE WAS FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING FUNDING PROPOSALS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS AND- DUE TO THE FOCUS FIVE PREVIOUSLY DID NOT PROVIDE A LONG TERM PICTURE OF CCAR'S FACILITY NEEDS. IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR A VIEW OF WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS WERE PROJECTED TO BE NEEDED OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN SHOWN IN THE EMPOWER. THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE OR S. R. L. WAS ADOPTED WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. TO DEVELOP OUR RESPONSE TO THE S. R. L. CDC ARE REVIEWED SEVERAL SOURCES OF DATA REGARDING CURRENT INTRODUCTION CONDITIONS. TO IDENTIFY PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO BOARD PRIVATIZATION DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THE INCLUSION OF THIS INFORMATION HAS GREATLY ENHANCED THE VALUE OF THE- PARK AS A LONGER TERM PLANNING DOCUMENT ONE COMPARED TO THE M. PARTS PER YEAR. REMAINING PORTIONS OF THE S. R. L. WERE DRESSED IN A NARRATIVE SUPPLEMENT RELEASED WITH THE M. PARK. AS IDENTIFIED IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S AGENDA THE ADDITIONAL PORTIONS OF THE S. R. L. INCLUDED DISCUSSIONS ON. WHETHER ANY OF THE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED MA'AM PART WORKS TO NEVER GET SCALE THAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES. SUCH AS CONSOLIDATION OF PRESENTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. HOW THE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED INAMDAR SUPPORT A LONG TERM DURABLE PORTFOLIO FACILITIES FOR CDC ARE. INDESCRIBABLE STEPS TAKEN IN PROJECT PLANNING AND PRIORITIZATION TO MINIMIZE INVESTMENT IN PRISONS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR FUTURE CLOSURES. GDPR'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE S. R. L. WAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS LOOKING FOR A DEEPER DIVE REGARDING LARGE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED OUR VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED IDENTIFIES THESE ANTICIPATED PROJECT NEEDS OF CDCR ACTIVE INSTITUTIONS. BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ESTARÁ REQUEST CCAR'S REPORT WAS IT WHAT WAS RESPONSIVE TO THE ESTARÁ. SINCE THE RELEASE OF pTHE LEGISLATURE WAS SEEKING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN CDCR RESPONSE. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ARE ON THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. EVEN WITH THESE CONCERNS THE M. R. AND S. R. L. IN SPECIFICALLY THE% TEN YEAR PROJECTION OF SIGNIFICANT FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. PROVIDES A MORE TRANSPARENT VIEW OF FUTURE FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE FUNDING REQUEST FROM CDC ARE THAT ARE LISTED UNDER ISSUE SEVEN OF TODAY'S AGENDA ARE REQUESTED BY CDC ARE AT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY STATION THE DEPARTMENT TODAY TO SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH. MEDICAL CARE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT CONSISTENCY DISCHARGE RESPONSIBILITIES AND TO ADDRESS KEY INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS WATER. COOLING AND SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS. DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE NEEDS ADDRESSED BY EACH OF THESE PROJECTS- IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BUDGET REQUEST INCLUDING ALTERNATIVES CONSIDER FOR THESE PROJECTS AND HOW THE PROJECT SPENT WITH A DURABLE CAL POLY- OF FACILITIES. HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN THE- CBCP DOCUMENTS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO I THINK- THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON THIS INFORMATIONAL ITEM AND I'LL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY. HAVE- DURING DURING THIS HEARING. CAITLIN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. CAN YOU HEAR ME THE BILL. L. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS. AND THERE ON FOOT TRUMP I DON'T. NO ONE'S ON HELLO YEAH MONDAY. WE NEED HER SON SO SORRY. I CAN I CAN GET. CAITLIN O'NEILL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS- ITEM AND GIVEN THAT IT'S NOT A PROPOSAL BUT I DO HAVE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS FOR THE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION I'M WHICH ARE THAT WE FOUND THAT THE REPORT THAT THE REPORT WAS NOT FULLY RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION FOR TWO MAIN REASONS. WHICH ARE- ONE THE REPORT ASSUMES THAT ALL FACILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN OPERATION WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN OPERATION TEN YEARS FROM NOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT. B. POPULATION PROJECTIONS SUGGEST THAT THE STATE COULD BE IN A POSITION TO CLOSE AROUND FIVE PERCENT- FIVE PRISONS WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND DESPITE THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTION TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO CONSOLIDATE PRESENCE TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES. TO THE IDENTIFIED PROJECTS ARE NOT AS WE UNDERSTAND BASED ON A SYSTEMATIC- ASSESSMENT OF BE ANTICIPATED INMATE REHABILITATION AND HEALTHCARE NEEDS THAT. HEALTHCARE INNER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN OTHER WORDS IT'S SORT OF WAS A SILO TO. LOOK AT MORE PROJECT TRADITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES I GUESS YOU COULD SAY SUCH AS REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND HEALTH SAFETY X. SENTARA- BUT NOT A LOOK AT THE PROGRAMMATIC INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IF YOU WELL- IN THIS WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE RE. WITH DESCRIBE HOW THE IDENTIFIED PROJECTS SUPPORT A LONG TERM. DURABLE PORTFOLIO OF FACILITIES TO MEET THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION AND THE STATE'S LONG TERM. NEED FOR PRISON CAPACITY. IN ADDITION WHILE THE S. R. L. DIDN'T DIRECTLY REQUIRE THIS- WE NOTE THAT THE PLAN DOES NOT CONSIDER THE SPREAD OF AIRBORNE DISEASE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE- IN MULTIPLE EXPERTS HAVE TESTIFIED THAT IN COURT THAT- THE ARCHITECTURE OF SAN QUENTIN HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC WITH THE SPREAD OF COVE AND- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT. OTHER PRISONS HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS THAT JUST HAVEN'T BEEN UNDER AS MUCH SCRUTINY AT SAN QUENTIN SO THERE'S LESS INFORMATION BUT- THAT BEING SAID THE REPORT DID NOT INCLUDE A SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT OF THAT FACTOR AS IT RELATES TO INFRASTRUCTURE- AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WHETHER OR NOT. THE REPORT IS OR ISN'T RESPONSIVE IT IT. WHAT IT DOES SEEM CLEAR IS THAT THE LIST OF PROJECTS MAY ON THE ONE HAND INCLUDE. PROJECTS AT THE STATE ULTIMATELY WON'T NEED TO PURSUE BECAUSE- THOSE FACILITIES MAY BE CLOSED AND ON THE OTHER HAND MAY NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN PROJECTS OF THE STATE MAY NEED TO PURSUE. PURSUE FOR. AREAS PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS SUCH AS REHABILITATION OR HEALTH CARE THANK YOU. I JUST NAMING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE EMPIRE THIS YEAR PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION THAT HAS IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE REPORT IS A GOOD OVERVIEW OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND POTENTIAL FUTURE PROJECTS PROJECTED FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS- I DO WANT TO REITERATE MISTER BOARD STATEMENT THAT THESE DOCUMENTS ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY TO BE PLANNING DOCUMENTS. FOR WHAT PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT MAY SPEAK IN THE FUTURE- THE PROJECTS ARE IDENTFIED ARE LARGELY CONCEPTUAL AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE JUSTIFICATION FOR PROJECTS INCLUDED IN THAT TWENTY TWENTY PROPOSED BUDGET I THAT SAID THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THE SENSITIVITY AND CONCERN ABOUT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE- FUNDING AT THE STATE PRISON POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO DECLINE IN FUTURE YEARS. HOWEVER THAT PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU TODAY AND FOR INCLUSION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY- BUDGET REPRESENT THE MOST IMMEDIATE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION AND CONTINUATION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AND MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I'M GONNA MAKE A COMMENT AND ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE MINUTE ISSUE GOING ON LONG BEFORE I BECAME THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I WILL HAVE A SET OF QUESTIONS AT THE END BUT- I WANT TO TALK DIRECTLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FIGHT. FINANCED AND I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU DO UNDERSTAND THE SENSITIVITY I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT EXPECTATIONS OF INFORMATION WE WANT- ABOUT OUR DUTY AS AN EQUAL PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND- IN THIS PROCESS- AND- WHILE YOU MIGHT HAVE PROVIDED MORE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST IT'S STILL NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. THE PIECES OF INFORMATION WE ARE ASKING FOR IT SO- IT FILLS IN GENUINE CITIES TO HEAR THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE SENSITIVITIES. OF WHAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE IN HERE THIS COMMITTEE WANTS. US A FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER I CONSIDER OF IT THINK ABOUT THE STUDENTS THAT WOULD TELL ME- I WOULD GIVE AN ASSIGNMENT IT WOULD TELL ME BUT I SUBMIT THAT THIS IS JUST GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THAT I WAS LIKE NO IT'S NOT TRUE THAT YOU SUBMITTED SOMETHING. THAT A STATEMENT IS PRETTY CLEAR IT'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR LONG BEFORE I BECAME THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE- SO PRETTY FRUSTRATED- BY BY WHAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO US AND HARD FOR ME TO BE APPRECIATIVE. FOR THE NEW INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE WHEN IT'S NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. THINGS LIKE PRESENT- CAN MAKE POPULATION PROJECTIONS AND REDUCTIONS THAT WE- WERE EXPECTING ON THE WAY AND SO WANT TO MAKE MY DISSATISFACTION HERE. BUT ALSO GIVEN THAT I HAVE COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE LONGER THAN I HAVE AND HAVE BEEN FIGHTING DESPITE LONGER THAN I HAVE WANT TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD WITH QUESTIONS- STARTING WITH. THE MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF HATE I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE GENTLEMAN FROM CDC ARE- WE KNOW COVERT BROUGHT TO LIGHT A LOT OF DEFICIENCIES IN THE PRISON SYSTEM- YOU KNOW NOT ONLY THE LACK OF SPACE WHISTLES DISTANCING THE- THE YARD. IN ADEQUATE TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS AVAILABLE- AS WELL AS A MYRIAD OF OTHER THINGS- BOTH IN THE ARCHITECTURE IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT UPGRADES IF ANY THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE BECAUSE THEY LOOK A LOT OF THEM ON THE LIST TO REPAIR AND REPLACE. OUR IN OUR YOU KNOW RELATIONS WHAT WE LEARNED DURING COVED. AND- YOU KNOW WE- HAD IT IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH CDCR FOLKS OVER THE YEARS. THEY ADMIT AND IN THEIR OWN WORDS SAY THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE DILAPIDATED ANY ON THIS LIST ARE IN RELATION TO WHAT WE LEARNED IN LIGHT OF COVED IN THOSE DEFICIENCIES. IN A IN A WAY THAT WE CAN PREVENT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAPPENED IN THE PANDEMIC THAT WE SAW. ALL RIGHT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AGAIN THIS IS- DEAN BORG I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ON CAMERA- THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN MANY STEPS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS RELATED TO- COLD AND- IN ORDER TO ADJUST BOTH OUR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES. AND OUR MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES- TO ADDRESS- TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MINIMISE THE- MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITIES OF SPREAD SAYING IT IS AN AIRBORNE- AIRBORNE SPREAD DISEASE- MANY OPERATIONAL- CHANGES REGARDING- OCCUPANCY AND- BECAUSE WILL DISTANCING HAVE OCCURRED. THROUGHOUT THE INSTITUTIONS- I YOU KNOW AND I'VE BEEN THERE WE'VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY AS AS WE GO- WHEN IT COMES TO THE- PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO- VENTILATION AND THE AND THE ROLE IT PLAYS- DEPARTMENT- DID UPGRADE ALL- AIR HANDLING UNITS. THAT RECIRCULATE AIR AS PART OF ITS HEATING OR COOLING OPERATIONS TO USING MERV THIRTEEN FILTERS- WHICH WASA HIGHER EFFICIENCY FILTER AND- RECOMMENDED BY A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY GROUPS- AS A- A GOOD WAY OF REDUCING THE POSSIBILITY OF A SPREADING- THE- VIRUS THROUGH- THROUGH VENTILATION- WE ALSO MAXIMIZE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE USE OF A DIRECT OUTSIDE AIR RATHER THAN RECIRCULATION- AGAIN TO. MINIMIZE THE- MINIMIZED POSSIBILITIES OF SPREADING IT THAT WAY- DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO- REVIEW A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REPORTS- THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. TO LOOK AT- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT WAYS THAT- THINGS COULD TO COULD BE ADJUSTED DOWN THE ROAD- THERE ARE NO DIRECT PROJECTS IN HERE- DIRECTLY- RELATED COBIT. BARLEY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE- LITERATURE OUT THERE IS CONTINUING TO EVOLVE SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR EYE ON THAT AND SEE WHAT- NEEDS TO BE DONE- TO ADJUST THE OPERATION. MORE COMPONENT PARTS OF OUR VENTILATION SYSTEMS. I JUST WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS- THE- STATEMENT ABOUT- HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND DILAPIDATED CONDITION- WE HAVE- BEEN FORTY- IN PARTNERSHIP ALLEGED. TO RECEIVE A OF FUNDING IN ORDER TO ADDRESS- WE TO A MILLION. IN ONE TIME FOR ME FUNDING BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND- JUST THIS PAST YEAR- IT OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A ROOF REPLACEMENT FUNDING HAS BEEN APPROVED- BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND THIS PAST YEAR- AND- THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FUNDING THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAS INCREASED FROM. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE MILLION TO OVER SEVENTY MILLION THANKS TO- INCREASES IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THAT MONEYIS MAKING A DIFFERENCE- OUT THERE. THE CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST DECADE ARE- BEING. ARE ARE BEING ADDRESSED IN LARGE PART THROUGH THE ONE TIME PROJECTS AND THE ANNUAL- MAINTENANCE FUNDING INCREASE IS ALLOWING INSTITUTIONS TO. NOT RUN THEIR EQUIPMENT UNTIL IT FAILED BUT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AIR HANDLING UNITS PUMPS OTHER KEY PIECES OF MACHINERY THAT- ARE BREAKING DOWN ON A FREQUENT BASIS AND BEING ABLE TO REPLACE THAT. WITH THE THEIR ANNUAL FUNDING AMOUNT SO WE THINK THAT THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE WAY THE CONDITIONS OUT THERE- THAT'LL CONTINUE TO- INCREASE. FOR THE BETTER- IN THE COMING YEARS. JUST A FOLLOW UP THING YOU- YOU KNOW IN ADDITION WE ALSO SAW. THAT DURING THE EMERGENCY. IT COULD BE COVERED IT COULD BE A NATURAL DISASTER FOR ALL WE KNOW- WE SAW THAT FAMILIES WERE UNABLE TO CONTACT THEIR LOVED ONES- DURING THAT TIME BECAUSE OF. ISSUES WITH COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OR WHAT HAVE YOU- AS WELL AS TREAT SOME TRAINING WAS UNAVAILABLE COUNSELING. ENDED IN SOME PLACES AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEEDED IT THE MOST- WHAT IS BEING PLAN TO IMPROVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND PRISONS. SO THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. IN IN THESE TIMES. LET ME PROVIDE WHAT INFORMATION I CAN ON THAT- I DO HAVE ANOTHER COLLEAGUE NOT A PART OF TODAY'S HEARING WHO IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR- THE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS- I DO KNOW THAT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY THAT PARTLY WERE DONE IN RESPONSE TO COBIT OR WERE IN THE WORKS HARD CODED REGARDING VIDEO VISITATION- WE ARE ALSO- IMPLEMENTING THE- COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM WHICH IS REPLACING THE- PHONE- THE INMATE MORE **** TELEPHONE SYSTEM WITH A TABLET- WHICH WILL INCREASE- COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES SO THERE ARE A NUMBER NUMBER WAY- WAYS- THAT ARE GOING ON TO INCREASE- COMMUNICATION- THE- INCARCERATED POPULATION. AND THEIR LOVED ONES. OKAY SO. IS THERE A TIMELINE FOR THAT ARE THERE ON THE WAY BUT- WILL THEY BE IN ALL OF FACILITIES I THINK WOULD BE. A. I. EITHER TO BE ABOUT THE FIVE I COULD ASK MY COLLEAGUE TO PUT TOGETHER SOME INFORMATION- AND- TRUE I WOULD MISS THE PLANE WILL MAKE SURE THAT INFORMATION GETS GETS BACK TO YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY AND JUST. IF I COULD HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION- SO IT AS FAR AS IMPROVEMENTS I'M LOOKING IN THE LIST OF THEM IMPROVE AND REPLACE- A LOT WHICH IS NEEDED DEFINITELY BUT ALSO THE OUTLOOK AS YOU KNOW WHAT THE PRISONS ANY. YOU KNOW GOIG OUT TEN TWENTY YEARS WE TALK ABOUT SOME REALIGNMENT OF FOLKS IF OF A PRISONER TO IS CLOSE WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES THOSE WILL BE BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE MOVED DOWN TO COUNTY LEVEL OR- OR OTHER. TYPES OF SITUATIONS A LOT OF TIMES FOLKS HAVE MOVED INTO ANOTHER FACILITY AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE A REDUCTION IN. IN ANOTHER FACILITY SO WE'RE BASICALLY MOVING PEOPLE AROUND AND SOME OF THE PLANNING WOULD NEED TO BE- YOU KNOW RELATIVE TO THE FACT THAT- FOR SOME FACILITIES MAY INCREASE POPULATION AS AS FOLKS MOVED AROUND. BUT I GUESS THAT IS JUST THE COMMON. I WOULD HOPE THAT AS WE LOOK OUT INTO THE FUTURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT BRICK AND MORTAR BUT TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE CONDITIONS NOT ONLY FOR THE PEOPLE INSIDE BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE. LOTS OF FOLKS ARE THEIR FAMILIES VISITING LIGHTING SPACE CLASSROOMS THINGS THAT- ARE MORE- HAVE MORE OF A HUMAN FEEL. TO THEM AS WE LOOK AT REPLACING AND REPAIRING. THAT'S MY COMMENT THANK YOU. MISTER LUCKY. YEAH I KNOW THAT- ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF QUITE A- A SON OF MONEY AND- WE HAVE FORTY FIVE. ROGIC SHARED THAT ARE LISTED ON HERE BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY PRIORITIZATION. A WHICH WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE FACT THAT IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT NOT EVERYONE OF THESE PROJECTS WOULD GET FUNDED AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IS THERE SOME KIND OF INTERNAL PRIORITIZATION THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE THAT MIGHT BE A BECOME AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY FOR THAT QUESTION- THE PRIORITIZATION- GOES ON ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- IN PREPARATION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RELEASED IN EACH IN JANUARY- SO DO WITH THAT. ANY SORT OF PRIORITIZATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD PUT TOGETHER RIGHT NOW WITH- FORTY FIVE PROJECTS- WOULD BE SUBJECT TO- TREMENDOUS CHANGE AS WE GO ALONG BECAUSE W HAVE TO BE READY TO ADJUST TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES- BE THAT CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDING- THE- POPULATION OR OR OTHER NEEDS WITHIN. THE PRISONS CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDING- DIFFERENT REGULATORY OR OR COURT SITUATION SO THERE ISN'T A HARD FAST PRIORITIZATION THAT APPLIES YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR TO THESE PROJECTS- WE WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- EACH YEAR WHEN WE'RE PREPARING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST AND OF COURSE THE- ALSO INCLUDES WORKING WITH. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANOTHER- PURCHASE OF THESE MINISTRATION TO THEN NARROW DOWN OUR FOCUS TO WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET REQUESTS AND THEN PROVIDE VERY DETAILED DOCUMENTS. BACKING UP BUILD THOSE ITEMS SO THIS WAS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE UNIVERSAL PROJECTS THAT WE FEEL ARE ARE IMPORTANT- BUT AS FAR AS WHICH PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE REQUESTING FUNDING FOR- THE NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER THE YEAR AFTER- WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THAT PURCHASE ACTION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BRING THAT INFORMATION FORWARD. I. EACH JANUARY IN THE OF GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO FIVE YOU. YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS THE ONE THAT. MAKES THOSE OF PRIORITIZATION DECISIONS NOT NOT YOU FOLKS. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME ANOTHER ARNOLD I THINK YOU KNOW. I APOLOGIZE FOR- PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION- THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH THE DEPARTMENT- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN REVIEWING OUR PROPOSALS IN DEVELOPING WHAT WILL END UP IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AT THE END OF THE END OF THE YEAR AT THE END OF THE PROCESS A RELEASE OF THE- LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY. OKAY GET WELL JUST SO YOU KNOW I DO. AS A COMMITTEE MEMBER I CAN'T SPEAK FOR AN ENTIRE COMMITTEE BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO BE PART OF THAT PRIORITIZATION DECISION TREE SOMEHOW. AND SUGGESTION WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED BUT- YEAH THAT'S MY REMARKS. I DON'T THE AGENCY WOULD WANNA- YOU GOT ELECTED YOUR CITY IS COMMITTEES TO YOU GET TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS I LIKE THE REST OF THE THIRTEEN. ANY QUESTIONS IF I CONDUCTOR WALKED I WOULD COME ALONG MY REMARKS WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALMDALE- IT JUST BOUGHT JUST TO FOLLOW UP SO- YOU HAVE AN ITEM SEVEN OF FOR A VARIETY OF FROM. FOURTEEN REQUIRES SO- CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THE CRITERIA THAT YOU DEVELOP TO DETERMINE THESE REQUESTS. FOR THIS YEAR GOOD SENSE LIKE YOU DO IT. I DO WE HEAR YOU CORRECTLY THIS IS DONE YEAR TO YEAR SO EVERY YEAR THE PRIORITIES ARE DIFFERENT AND EVERY YEAR THE CRITERIA IS DIFFERENT. THE RIGHT YEP BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THE CRITERIA IS DIFFERENT THE CRITERIAS EVALUATED EVERY YEAR THE GREAT THING IS DONE NOTHING TO SHARE WITH. OUR KERRY THAT BE GREAT- CRITERIA IT HAS BEEN- YEAH IT INVOLVES- I'M NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT ARE OF SHARED- PRIORITIES COULD YOU JUST WALK US THROUGH THE STATE I MATTER I HEAR A LOT OF- DANCING IF YOU COULD JUST. WALK US THROUGH THE STEPS WHAT ARE THE ITEMS. LET ME CLEAR FIRED ARE YOU ASKING ME TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUES THAT WHAT THE ITEMS ARE IN ISSUE SEVEN- OR DO YOU NOT WANT TO HEAR HOW WE PRIVATE HOW WE PRIORITISE RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE ITEMS AN ISSUE SEVEN. I'D LIKE TO HEAR HOW YOU- YOU WHAT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T PRIORITIZE- THAT WAS ONE. SO IF YOU DO IF YOU IF YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE SAYING YOU ARE PRIORITIZING I LIVE WE LIVE I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES. AND I WOULD WE DON'T LOOK AT YOUR. IN DEVELOPING OUR FUNDING REQUEST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EACH YEAR. WE USE A SET OF PRIORITIZATION WHICH DOES NOT ASSIGN A NUMERICAL VALUE TO EACH. BUT EQUAL REVIEWS THEM ON AN EQUAL BASIS- THIS INCLUDES FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP. THROUGH OUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE- STATE FIRE MARSHAL. ITEMS RELATED TO POOR COMPLIANCE OF THESE ARE. ITEMS THAT HAVE COME UP- THROUGH. OUR DEPARTMENT INTERACTION WITH- VARIOUS COURTS IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP- THROUGH THE DIFFERENT REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT MAY- HAVE AUTHORITY OVER WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS FOR WATER TREATMENT PLANTS. REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING ENSURING THAT- ANY NEW SPACE THAT'S NECESSARY FOR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING IS A PART OF THE PRIORITY- AND OF COURSE- THE STAFF AND POPULATION SAFETY ARE IMPORTANT SO ALL OF THE PROJECTS ARE LOOKED AT WITH THAT CONTEXT. AND THE ONES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST- NEED FOR THE COMING YEAR BASED UPON THE CONTEXT OF THOSE FIVE MAIN PRIORITIES IS HOW WE ESTABLISH OUR PRIORITIES ARE. THANK YOU SINCE SINCE YOU DON'T PUT A NUMERIC VALUE CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH HOW YOU DETERMINE WHICH PROJECTS TO SUBMIT. WELL IN PARTICULAR THE ITEMS ARE LISTED UNDER AND IN ISSUE SEVEN- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE ITEMS WITH ONLY TWO EXCEPTIONS ARE ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROVED- IN PRIOR BUDGET ACTION FOR SOME LEVEL OF FUNDING IN MOST CASES IT'S BEEN FOR THE- THE FIRST OR SECOND PLAGUE OF DESIGN FUNDING. AND SO OUR FIRST PRIORITY AND PUTTING THAT TOGETHER IS TO CONTINUE OUR PROGRESS ON PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY. UNDERWAY SO WE HAVE RECEIVED THE FIRST- PAID THE DESIGN FUNDING. I WILL BE REQUESTING A SECOND PHASE OF THE DESIGN FUNDING. FOR PROJECTING THAT WE WILL COME FULLY COMPLETE LEVINE DURING THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR THAT WILL BE REQUESTING THE CONSTRUCTION FUNDING FOR THOSE PROJECTS. SO THAT IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHAT IS IN THE ITEMS AN ISSUE SEVEN ARE THE ONLY TWO THAT ARE BRAND NEW ITEMS. ONE HALF DO WITH- PROVIDING- EXERCISE YARD SPACE- FOR- PATIENTS THAT ARE IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS- AT- CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON CORCORAN- THAT ASKING FOR THE DESIGN FUNDING FOR THE FOR THAT. AND THE SECOND PROJECT THE ONLY OTHER NEW PROJECT ALSO CORCORAN. THE REQUESTED DESIGN FUNDING FOR NEW RADIO TOWER EQUIPMENT FAULTS- IT CURRENTLY THE- THE PRISONS OF SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS IS BASED ON A TEMPORARY LOAN OF A- TRAILER BASED SYSTEM. FROM C. H. P. AND SO WE NEED TO REPLACE IT WITH A PERMANENT- PERMANENT SOLUTION. M. WALK WALKER THROUGH HOW THOSE TWO PROJECTS. ROSE TO THE TOP OF THE HEAP. OF THE ONE FOR THE- THE EXERCISE YARD FOR OUR LITTLE HEALTH CRISIS OF PATIENTS IS- BASED UPON ON GOING WORK WITH THE- COLEMAN COURT- REGARDING- BEING ABLE TO MEET THE UP PROGRAM GUIDE ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO A SUICIDE PREVENTION AND ITEMS LIKE THAT- THE ABILITY PROVIDE FULL COURSE OF A TREATMENT FOR OUR PATIENTS IN THAT LEVEL OF A CRISIS- INVOLVED THE BILITY FOR OUTDOOR RECREATION AND AT THIS ONE LOCATION COMPARED TO OUR OTHER LOCATIONS. THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO THE- LOCATION WHERE THE CRISIS CENTER LOCATED SO IN ORDER TO- CONTINUE TO FULFILL OUR OBLIGATIONS- UNDER THAT CASE- THAT ONE ROSE TO A LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE TO BEGIN THE DESIGN PROCESS. AND EVELYN MENTIONED WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A TEMPORARY LOAN OF THE TRAILER FROM C. H. P. AND C. H. P. HAS- INDICATED THAT- THEY THEY KNEW THAT TRAILER BACK FOR OTHER USAGES SO WE NEED TO START THE PROCESS EVEN THOUGH CAPITAL OUTLAY IS CLEARLY NOT AN OVERNIGHT PROCESS- IT WAS IMPORTANT TO START THE PROCESS FOR THE DESIGN FOR A PERMANENT RADIO TOWER EQUIPMENT BALLS SO THAT THE LOAN OF THAT. COULD. BE RETURNED CHU CH P. OKAY OKAY AND THEN CAN YOU ON. YOU SEE JUST LISTED ARE A REPEAT WHAT YOU MISTER WHICH IS FIRE LIFE SAFETY COMPLIANCE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND STAFFING POPULATION SAFETY SO COULD YOU. WALK US THROUGH ON HOW THE RADIO TOWER EQUIPMENT VAULT- WHICH WHICH CATEGORY THAT FALLS INTO. THE RADIO OF ALL FALLS INTO STEP WITH POPULATION SAFETY WITHIN OUR SECURITY COMMUNICATION RADIO SYSTEM THAT SERVES BOTH OF CORCORAN AND- THE- NEIGHBORING- TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY PERSON. VERY GOOD SO ON LIST GIVE US A SENSE OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT LEVEL DOWN. YOU COULD LOSE IT ALL THE PROJECT INFO IN. THE REPORT BACK TO US SO. WHAT WHAT DIDN'T QUITE MAKE THE CUT. WITHOUT PULLING OUT SPECIFIC EXAMPLES BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION PORTRAYED IN FRONT OF ME IN A MANNER THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- CAPITAL OUTLAY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON THESE PROJECTS IN MANY CASES IT WOULD. BE PROJECTS THAT AGAIN SIMILARLY DEALING WITH FIRE LIFE SAFETY OR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT NEED MAY NOT BE AS URGENT AS IN THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY IN FOR IN FRONT OF US AND- ARE CONTINUING THROUGH THE DESIGN PROCESS HELLO DESIGNER FUNDING PROCESS- IN THE BUDGET SO WILL BE A MIXTURE OF PROJECTS AMONG THOSE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. IT'S JUST THAT THE WE MAY HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE FIRE MARSHAL OR REGULATORY AGENCY WHICH GIVES US A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME FOR COMPLIANCE- THAN SOME OTHER PROJECTS MAY REQUIRE AND SO FOR THOSE PROJECTS OTHER MAYBE A YEAR DELAY THE REQUESTED FUNDING RATHER THAN HAVING THEM IN THIS YEAR'S- PROPOSAL. SO IN OUR IN OUR OWN. AGENDA ON PAGE FIVE IS STATES THAT ACCORDING TO. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT TWENTY SIX OUT OF THIRTY FOUR PRISONS. HAD AN FCI OF OVER 50% WHICH MEANS THEY'RE VERY POOR TO EXTREMELY POOR SO. I GUESS THERE- YOU KNOW. FROM A BAD NEWS POINT OF VIEW YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES. IN TERMS OF WHAT TO FIX. SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH IS WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW YOU. DETERMINE WHICH ITEMS TO BRING FORWARD TO THE COMMITTEE. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY- METHODOLOGY- I MEAN THAT YOU HAVE YOUR CATEGORIES BUT I STE WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND OR I DON'T UNDERSTAND MAYBE OTHER COLLEAGUES TO UNDERSTAND- HOW. YOU DETERMINED BASED ON THOSE CATEGORIES WHAT. YOU'RE GOING TO BRING FORTH. I APOLOGIZE MISTER KING BUT I HAVE NO FURTHER INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ON ON THE SUBJECT- THIS IS THE WAY THE MANNER IN WHICH WE GO THROUGH PRIORITIES PRIORITIZING OUR MOST IMPORTANT- NEEDS EACH YEAR- THROUGH THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. I BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND SO WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THE FINAL CUT HOW DO YOU MAKE THE FINAL CUT. BECAUSE IT SEEMS VERY RANDOM AT THIS POINT. SO SHOULD WE IN DETERMINING OF THESE FOURTEEN ITEM SO WE JUST TAKE A DART BOARD AND SEE WHICH STARTS HIT THE FOURTEENTH ITEMS OR WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THERE I MEAN HELP US BECAUSE WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR APPROACH WE COULD HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE FUND. WELL WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT IN GETTING TO THE PROJECTS THAT- ARE EXCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY- IT IS A LONG PROCESS THAT CONSIDERS. OTHER PROJECTS WORKING WITH OUR DEPARTMENTAL STAKEHOLDERS OUR DEPARTMENTAL LEADERSHIP. AND THEN WORKING THROUGH THE INTERNET BUDGET PROCESS WITH THE PARTNER FINANCE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE. D. E. DEPARTMENTS HIGHEST PRIORITIES ARE IDENTIFIED IN BEING ABLE TO THEN MOVE FORWARD- IN BUDGET REQUESTS. SO IT'S A PROCESS OF. WINNOWING WITH PEOPLE CONTINUING TO APPLY THE- BASED ON BUT THEY STARTED WATCHING PRINCIPLE. BUT BASED ON WHAT SO YOU SEE YOU START OFF THE THING ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD SAY IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE. ARE YOU ARE YOU NOT ALLOWED TO SAY ANYTHING MORE GIVING YOU THE AND- I'M GIVING YOU THE I'M EXPLAINING THE ENTIRE PROCESS. OKAY WILL WALK US THROUGH THE MOST DEFINITE IT WITH THEIR OWN LEVEL OF SO YOU YOU YOU GET YOU GET INTO THE ROOM YOU GOT STAKEHOLDERS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I DON'T KNOW I SNIOR HUNTER ME YOU WOULD LITERALLY YOU'VE YOU'VE DOCUMENTED VERY THOROUGHLY. YOU KNOW LET'S LARGE. LIST OF PROJECTS OR HOW DO YOU AS I SAID WE WORK WITH DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE DEPARTMENT BE UNDERSTAND YOU WORK HOW THE HOW THE HUNDRED FIVE HOW DO YOU DO THAT- WHEN YOU SAY YOU WORK WITH AND HOW DO YOU WANT WITH THEM AND HOW DO YOU COME UP WITH A BASED ON WHAT I MEAN THIS THIS IS A LIKE EVERY DEPARTMENT EVERY DAY DECEMBER PRESENT GET LIKE ONE CHOICE AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT TAKES EVERY CHOICE AND SAYS YOU KNOW WE JUST PICKED HERE PICKED OUT HERE LIKE WHAT. WHAT WHAT IS IT. IF I MAY CONTINUE PLEASE- WE- WILL WORK WITH THESE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS- IN MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH CARE D. A. I. REAL BILL KIND OF SERVICES. GET THEIR INPUT ON THE VARIETY PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED FROM THE INSTITUTIONS. AT THE SAME TIME FIND OUT WHETHER THEY HAVE ANY PRIORITIES OF THEIR OWN THAT WERE NOT LISTED. BY THE INSTITUTIONS. WHEN WE GATHER THAT INFORMATION- A OF. COMPONENTS OF THE DIVISION THAT I REPRESENT MORE PUT TOGETHER RECOMMENDATIONS BASED UPON THAT INFORMATION. AND THEN WE COMPARE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BACK WITH THE- DIRECTORS AND THAT LEAD. TO DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE DEPARTMENT- D. A. HIGH RESULTED OF SERVICES. AGAIN HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE- IN INSIGNIFICANCE CONCURRENCE OF THOSE PRIORITIES. WAR MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT THEY REQUEST- THEN WILL MEET WITH- UNDERSECRETARIES AND GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS- EXPLAINING- WHAT WE'VE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING- AND THEN THOSE. DOCUMENTS ARE PUT TOGETHER- WITH THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROJECTS. AND SENATE BEGINS THE- INTERNET BUDGET PROCESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND CONTINUING TO ASK QUESTIONS. ANSWER QUESTIONS- THAT THEY HAVE. REGARDING THE DIFFERENT- PROJECTS IN THE JUSTIFICATIONS. AND THE- THE NEEDS THAT WERE DRESSING. GOWN SO. SO I GET IT LIKE YOU HAVE MENTAL HEALTH AND OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND IMAGINE YOUR- REPRESENTATIVES IN THOSE DIVISIONS ARE OBVIOUSLY. ADVOCATING FOR THEIR- PARTY'S SIDE COMPLETE UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHAT TICKETS TO THE UNDERSECRETARY LEVEL. HOW DO YOU START PICKING. AND CHOOSING WINNERS AND LOSERS ALREADY COME UP WITH A- PRIORITIZATION- THE IN CONCERT WITH THE DIRECTORS OF THE DIVISIONS THAT REPORT TO THOSE UNDERSECRETARIES AND SO THE UNDERSECRETARIES OF REVIEWING- THE- RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY- THE DIRECTORS ARE REPORTED THEM. THAT'S HOW THAT'S HOW THE FINAL REVIEW IT OCCURS. IN IN THE DARK AND HOW HOW DO YOU GET TO THE- PRIVATIZATIONS WITH THOSE DIRECTORS I IMAGINE EACH OF THOSE DIRECTORS ADVOCATING FOR THEIR OWN. DIVISIONS I PART OF FROM USING THE WRONG TERMINOLOGY BUT- HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT. AT. AND HAVING DISCUSSIONS THAT TALK ABOUT SHARED PRIORITIES- WHETHER CERTAIN PRIORITIES ARE READY TO GO FORWARD AT THAT TIME OR NEED MORE REVIEW IN ORDER TO GET THEM IN A BETTER PLACE TO MOVE FORWARD- AND REACHING CONSENSUS WITH- WITH THESE OTHER DIRECTORS. SO WON'T WALK US THROUGH THESE TWO PARTIES TO PUT THE TWO NEW PRIORITIES PUT FORWARD WHAT WHAT- WHAT- WHY YOU KNOW WHAT SHARED VALUES TODAY- EXHIBIT. ALL. THE- OVER THE DEPARTMENT'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE COMMON PROGRAM GUIDE IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN- CCAC UP FROM UP FROM AND CLEARLY IN NURSING- STANDPOINT OR MENTAL HEALTH- STAKEHOLDERS- FROM THE DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH STANDPOINT AND THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS- BECAUSE THEY OF COURSE NEED TO HELP- HELP HAVE PROGRAMS- WORK IT PEOPLE TO AND FROM THE PROGRAMS SO- THE SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN- IN THE NEED TO BE ABLE T THAT WE ARE MEETING THE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT NEEDS ARE IMPORTANT TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S HOW THE YARD FOR. A CORPORATE WAS ABLE TO RISE AGAIN IN PRIORITY- AND THEN THE SECOND ONE REGARDING SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS ARE ON ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS THE I. S. DIVISION- EASILY- TECHNICAL- PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH OUR RADIO SYSTEMS ARE OUT IN THE PRISONS- AND OF COURSE- THE DIVISION OF THE OLD INSTITUTION IS A MAJOR US STAKEHOLDER- AS FAR AS THE- ABILITY TO HAVE THE- RADIOS MARKING UP PROPERLY- AND HAVE BEEN- UPGRADING BOTH THE I. S. B. I'VE BEEN UPGRADING RADIOS- AT MANY OF OUR PRISONS TO- NEWER INTEROPERABLE WITH THE- AND PUBLIC SAFETY STANDARDS- BUT THAT'S UNABLE TO HAPPEN CORCORAN INTO WE ARE ABLE TO REPLACE THE- TRAILER THAT WERE- UTILIZING A LOAN FROM C. H. P. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND INTEGRATE THE INTER OPERABILITY STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY RADIOS AT CORCORAN WITH THE NEW. TOWER AND THE NEW OF ALL. SO YOU SHOULD THAT YOU KNOW YOU SHARED IN YOUR- REPORT ON THIS TO. OVERRIDE OF PROJECTS I THINK WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW. RADIO TOWER IN EQUIPMENT INVOLVED ROSE TO THE TOP BUT WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE OTHER CHALLENGES IN FRONT OF YOU. THE THIRTEEN DO YOU WANT ANOTHER ANSWER YOU WANT TO GO AROUND THE CIRCLE ON MY TIMER. GET GIVE ME A TO TWO MORE MINUTES OFF OKAY AT. OKAY SO AGAIN ON THAT QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF RADIO INTEROP ABILITY AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FELLOW STATE AGENCIES SUCH AS PHD. WHO CERTAINLY HAVE HELPED US OUT WITH THIS LOAN BUT YOU NEED THE EQUIPMENT BACK FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO START THE PROCESS BY WHICH AFTER A THREE TO FOUR YEAR PERIOD OF TIME WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN THE- RENTAL EQUIPMENT TO THE LOAN EQUIPMENT TO THEM. OKAY- ONE OF BURKE TO LAST QUESTION SO- THE WITH ITEM WITH THE OTHER CAR COCHRAN- REQUEST THIS IS A MENTAL HEALTH REQUEST OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES I ESTIMATE EVERY SINGLE FACILITY WHY WHY WAS THIS ONE CHOSEN. THIS IS PARTICULAR WE DON'T WE DO NOT A CRISIS BUT THAT EVERY SINGLE INSTITUTION- I THINK MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY THREE BUT I'M JUST PULLING THAT NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD- AT THE OTHER LOCATIONS- THERE ARE- EXERCISE- OPPORTUNITIES. AVAILABLE ADJACENT TO WHERE THE- CRISIS BEDS ARE LOCATED BUT BECAUSE OF THE- UNIQUE LOCATION AT CORCORAN- WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAD A- GENERAL SHOULD CARE HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INSTITUTION- A BACK ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO- THERE WERE NO- INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE YARDS- CONSTRUCTED AT THAT POINT TIME. SO IN OTHER LOCATIONS WILL BE A CRISIS BEDS WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE YARDS AVAILABLE TO ALLOW OUR A CRISIS PATIENTS- OUTDOOR RECREATION THAT DOES NOT EXIST AT THAT CORE CONSERVATIVE FIXING A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE. CAN THANK YOU SO A JUST A LOT LAST PIECES GO BACK TO THE- HE THE ISSUE A HAND- THE CURRENT- STATE POPULATION IS 910-001-0030 SEVEN JUST IN THE JUST IN THE PRESENCE. OF WHAT'S WHAT'S THE LATEST PROJECTION- FUTURE PROJECTION OF WHERE HE POPULATION'S GONNA GO. ANY PROJECTIONS- IF I REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THAT WERE INCLUDED. IN THE JANUARY BUDGET- SHOW AN INCREASE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS- AND THEN A DECREASE IN THE LAST- YEARS OF THE PROJECTION BUT I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF THE STORE. GOT ALL JUSTICE LA OAKS UNDERSTAND BITCOIN HOUSING FOR. HER YOU KNOW I EIGHT THINK I LEFT THE PRINTER EARLIER BUT pAROUND AT NINETY FIVE THOUSAND OR SO BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD SO KIND OF IT WILL GO IT'S PROJECTED TO GO UP AND THEN- KIND OF COME BACK DOWN TO WHERE WE ARE NOW MORE OR LESS BY THE ASSOCIATED B. L. B. FLAT. YOUR SIGNAL I MEAN THAT IN THE LONG OVER THE NEXT FIVE OR SO YEARS THAT'S WHAT IT SHOWING IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE AFTER THAT POINT OR FLATTEN OUT OKAY THEN THE LAST JUST THE LAST QUESTION THAT I'M NOT I'M NOT LINE. SO THEN IN TERMS OF AS YOU LOOKED OUT- PUT TOGETHER THE LIST OF PROJECTS THAT EACH OF THE FACILITIES DID YOU LOOK AT IT AND START TO- CONSIDER HOW YOU MIGHT DO- CONSOLIDATION OF YARDS OR. CONSOLIDATION OF FACILITIES. WELL MY ANSWER WE DID NOT SEE THAT THE LEVEL OF PROJECTS NEEDED AT A GIVEN PRISON WAS SUCH THAT IT- THIS SPOKE TO. THE NEED TO CONSOLIDATE THOSE PRESENT THAT PRISON WITH A WITH ANOTHER PERSON IN MOST OF THESE CASES THEY WERE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS NOT PROJECTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE- OF REQUIRE- ADDED SIGNIFICANT. CAPITAL OUTLAY- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FIXES ACROSS THE ENTIRETY OF THE PRISON. I GOT AND INSTANCE ARE SAYING QUESTION I GOT. TO TWO MORE THIS IS THE SAME QUESTION- I APOLOGIZE MEDICARE SO- WITH A WITH A DVR CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH. THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS BEFORE ANNOUNCING THE CLOSURE WHAT CAPITAL FOR PERSONAL. AS WELL AS WITH SUSANVILLE. I CANNOT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO GET THAT INFORMATION BACK TO YOU AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY GREAT TROUBLE WITH DVI MY RECOLLECTION WAS THERE WAS A- KICK FLIP. DON SIMILAR TO YOUR REQUEST FOR HIS TRIPS AND- THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS ARE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE- THERE ARE MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THERE WAS A HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT ON IT. DVRS ARE CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE INITIATED SOME ARE AROUND TWENTY TWELVE OR TWENTY THIRTEEN. GOT AND DID TO RIP CALL THE ROUGH COST APPROXIMATELY. MY RECOLLECTION FROM AROUND THIRTY. THIRTY MILLION OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW IF ON THE TO THE FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD. IT THAT WAS- SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE FIGURE I WAS GOING TO PULL OFF THE TOP OF MIND OKAY GREAT. SO I GUESS WHAT WHAT WERE THE REASON WE WERE ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS AS WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION. WHERE I WAS ON THE- YOU KNOW WE'RE MOVING IN A IN A GOOD DIRECTION IN TERMS OF REDUCING THE POPULATION- WE DON'T REALLY WANNA BE SPENDING MONEY IN FACILITIES- AND THEN CLOSING THOSE FACILITIES. YOU KNOW THAT ARE. BRAND NEW I GUESS IT'S SITTING THERE IN A THERE'S A- PRETTY NICE BRAND NEW HEALTH CARE FACILITY. AT DVI SO I THINK THAT IS- THE IMPETUS OF THE OF THE S. R. L. I WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT THE HELL ELSE COMMENTS ON- YOU KNOW WHAT THINK WE MAKE PRETTY CLEAR IN- PAST HEARINGS AS WELL AS MEETINGS WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT. THAT THE- PREVIOUS REPORT DIDN'T- RESPOND WASN'T WASN'T COMPLETE WASN'T- FULLY RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND NEITHER I WOULD SAY IS YOUR- CHARACTERIZATION. SO ON. IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE- LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE THIS YEAR AS WELL AS IN FUTURE HEARINGS TO. SABETTA PROCEDURE YOU'RE TIMING YOUR RESPONSES. THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER KING- FOR YOUR SET OF QUESTIONS. I JUST I AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE BUT- MISTER STONE AND I HAD TO TESTIFY AND I AND I MISS MOST OF THE DISCUSSION AND SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO OVER IT AGAIN BUT MAYBE MAYBE I CAN ASK THIS QUESTION JUST MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT WAY- WE- WE'VE READ. FOR AND WE'VE SEEN REPORTS FROM DIFFERENT FACTIONS THIS COMMITTEE HAS ASKED. FOR DIFFERENT INFORMATION- FOR QUITE SOME TIME- AS BEFORE HAD GRAY HAIR- THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION. BUT IT SO KIND OF THE DIRECTOR OVER GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF FOR EXAMPLE OF NOT WASTING TAX PAYERS MONEY BY DOING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON BUILDINGS THAT WERE GOING TO DEMOLISH OR ABANDON OR LEAVE THEY DID GENERAL- MANAGEMENT OR FACILITIES MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS. THAT HAVE BEEN COMING FROM THIS COMMITTEE AS TO NOT WASTE TAX PAYERS MONEY. ARE YOU IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT THE AT LEAST IN THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF WHAT WE CALL GOOD GOVERNMENT. OF BECAUSE IT IT BECAUSE WE WERE FOR A LITTLE PERPLEXED AT WHY IT TAKES SO LONG. TO GET THIS DONE WHEN DISK COULD BE SOMETHING. THAT YOU WOULD BELIEVE WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF EVERY CALIFORNIA AND SO AS AS YOU READ THROUGH ALL OF THE ANALYSIS AND EVERYTHING IS DONE. ARE THERE TO SERVE GENERAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN. REDUCING THE FACILITIES AND IF IT IF IT IF YOU DON'T DON'T BELIEVE IN IT. THEN DEFINITELY LET US KNOW IT MAY BE A VERY GOOD REASON WHY AS THE PRISON REDUCTION IN NUMBERS GO DOWN. AND YOU HAVE FEWER INMATES IN THESE FACILITIES. THERE'S GOT TO BE REASONS WHY YOU CAN'T. GIVE US A PLAN FOR THAT I DO KNOW. IF IT INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY YOU WOULD BE IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE WANTING TO BUILD NEW PRISONS JOHNNY ON THE SPOT ASKING FOR BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO WHY IS IT WHEN WE'RE GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. IT'S SO DIFFICULT. TO GET CDC ARE TO COOPERATE OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING. IN YOUR GENERAL METHODOLOGY- THAT. THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO GET BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE. WITH THE ANSWERS THAT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WANTING. MONEY SO I'M I'M GONNA ADD FROM A DIFFERENT MAYBE ASKING YOU WHY IT'S SO. DIFFICULT TO GIVE US WHAT WE WANT AND MAYBE WE CAN HELP YOU WITH ADDITIONAL MONEY RESOURCES OR SOMETHING TO GET YOU. THEIR LIVES- HELP IN OTHER WORDS. HELP US HELP YOU. THANK THANK YOU SIR FOR THAT FOR THAT QUESTION- I AM NOT IN NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING- FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR ASSISTANCE IN IN THESE DEISIONS- I AM A I GUESS WHAT I WOULD WANT ARE YOU SAYING THAT- DON'T IS THAT THAT. THIS COMMITTEE IS ASKS FOR ANYTHING ON THE OTHER STRUCTURE YOUR YOUR QUESTION OF HELP YOU'RE YOUR YOUR YOUR COMEDY- YOU KNOW IT HELP IT HELP YOU HELP US I WANT TO WAKE THE WANTED TO SAVE THE DEPARTMENT HAS- OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED THE REDUCING OUR POPULATION- THAT- HAS LED- TWO DECISIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND IN CONCERT WITH ADMINISTRATION- FOR THE CLOSURE OF PRISONS THAT WORLD AGREE TO AND- TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT- AND SO THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO REVIEW THE FACTORS- THAT ARE PRESENT REGARDING POPULATION PROJECTIONS A PROJECT A SUBPOPULATION NEEDS AND ALL THE ABOVE TO- E. VALUATE- THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL CULTURES. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS- THAT THAT ACT CERTAINLY IF IT'S NOT MY POSITION TO GIVE MY OPINION I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT AGAINST- WHAT THE POPULATION PROJECTIONS MAY SHOW- WOULD BE A NEED FOR FUTURE FUTURE CLOSURES. I JUST THINK THAT THE- PATHWAY TO GET THERE- REQUIRED A LOT OF DECISIONS ON DEPARTMENT- THAT REQUIRE. GOOD INFORMATION AND THAT INFORMATION TO BE AVAILABLE. AT THE RIGHT TIME- AND SO. WE GET BACK TO WINNING ORIGINAL POINTS OF YOUR DELIVERY OF NOT SPENDING MONEY AT PRISONS- MORE THERE'S A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF CLOSING I THINK THAT- DEPARTMENT WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION TO SAY THAT WE DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF BEING ABLE TO. GET INFORMATION TOGETHER THAT ALLOWS ONE TO SEE- WHAT THE FUTURE'S GOING TO HOLD AND BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IN A MANNER THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE TO MEET ITS MISSION- AT ITS FACILITIES- IT BECAUSE AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND HAVE INCARCERATED POPULATION AT THE FACILITY WE NEED TO MEET OUR PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS. THAT REQUIRES SOME LEVEL OF- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND IN CAPITAL OUTLAY- SO I GUESS I DON'T SEE-THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AS BEING. IN A POSITION OF TIME METRICALLY OPPOSED- I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED THAT HASN'T BEEN AVAILABLE YET. AND THAT THE SIDES ARE NOT THAT FAR APART AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO- REACHED CERTAIN CUT A CERTAIN DECISIONS. REGARDING FUTURE OPERATIONS PERSONS. BUT ISN'T IT TRUE. THAT THERE WAS A LAWSUIT SAYING THAT CDC ARE. REASON FOR STALLING OR INHIBITING OUR ABILITY TO CLOSE IS BECAUSE OF THE LOSSES IN A WE HAD NOT COME OVER TO ADEQUATELY PLAN. A PLAN THAT I BELIEVE NEEDS TO COME FROM. C. D. C. R. AND IF YOU CAN'T COME UP WITH IT. IT INHIBITS OUR ABILITY. TO SAVE TAXPAYER MONEY IN CLOSING THESE FACILITIES. AND OBVIOUSLY IN A SAFE EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE MANNER SO WHAT I'M- IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU HAVE NOT. IT OR CDCR HAS NOT COME ON BOARD WITH THIS CONCEPT OF CONSOLIDATION OR SO THAT WE CAN CREATE THE BEST OPTIMAL. BOB POSITION TO PUT EVERYBODY IN A IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SAVING TAXPAYERS MONEY THE SAID IT FEELS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T. THAT THE DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE HAS NOT COME TO GRIPS WITH IT AND I'VE WRAPPED THEIR ARMS AROUND IT DID NOT FULLY. KIND OF- ACCEPTED THAT THIS IS THE WAY. AS YOU SAID THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR MAY WANT AND I WOULD IMAGINE IF WE WERE TO DO A POLL WHEN I KNOW POLLS AREN'T EXACT REFERRED TO A POLE WITH TAXPAYERS THEY WOULD SAY. THEY AGREE WITH THE APPROACH. THAT THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IT'S TAKING RIGHT NOW HOWEVER CDC ARE MAY NOT REALLY BE ON BOARD WITH THIS JUST YET IT. THIS THIS IS DISCOUNTED APPEALING WE'RE GETTING. I WOULD I WOULDN'T I WOULD NEVER I CANNOT AGREE THAT THE- DEPARTMENT IS NOT IN THE SAME POSITION AS FAR AS THE GOVERNOR'S CONCERNED BECAUSE WE'RE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION SO ALL I CAN. SPEAK TO IS WE'RE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDED BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WAS IN THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET BUT WE ALSO IS THAT THAT TIS IS WHERE THINGS ARE NOW BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ARE STILL LOOKING AND EVALUATING THE NEEDS OF FOR THE FUTURE- THAT MAY BE DISCUSSED IN AND- WHEN BETTER. ONE BETTER OR MORE CLEAR INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. AND WHEN WILL THAT BE ABOUT MAYBE AND GO THAT WAY HOPE IS JUST ANOTHER. YOU KNOW I TERM OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR YOU HAVE AND WHAT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I MEAN I. I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING. HOW WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG WELL WHAT WHAT CAN WE GET THIS INFORMATION. I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME TO PROVIDE YOU BECAUSE IT'S AN ONGOING INTERVIEW PROCESS I THINK TO PLEASE ALL THE REFERENCE TO PM LEE AND MY REGIONAL. JUST TALKED TO WHOMEVER YOU NEED TO TALK TO. AND MAYBE GET BACK TO THE CHAIR. I'M PRETTY SURE IT THE CHAIR WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED. IN BRINGING. IN THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION TO A TO SOME KIND OF CLOSE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I WILL I WILL I HAVE A SET OF ACTIONS TO I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR QUESTIONS AND FOR REMINDING. CDC ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION THAT WE GET TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION IN THIS AS WELL- WHEN IT I WON ACTUALLY PIGGY BACK TO MISTER JOHN SERVICE QUESTION AND SO DO WE HAVE. DO WE HAVE ADEQUATE- PROJECTIONS. ABOUT PRISON POPULATION AT THIS POINT CAN YOU UGB WE HAVE ADEQUATE PROJECTIONS THIS IS FOR CDC ARE. OTHER THINGS THAT THEY JUST NEED A MINUTE BERMAN A FINANCE I CAN SPEAK TO THE PROJECTIONS FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS I DO JUST WANT TO KNOW AS THAT MR NEIL MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE'RE PROJECTING RIGHT NOW AN INCREASE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS- FOR VARIOUS COVERED RELATED REASONS AND BECAUSE OF BACKLOGS- IN AND TO ABOUT LEVEL OUT AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND. I DO WANT TO NOTE THOUGH THAT YOU KNOW OUR PROJECTIONS ARE GENERALLY REALLY GOOD WITHIN A COUPLE OF PERCENTAGE POINTS WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO BUT THE FURTHER OUT YOU GET- THE MUCH IT BECOMES MUCH HARDER TO KIND OF PROJECT WHERE THE POPULATION WILL BE. I'M JUST FOR REFERENCE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THE POPULATION WAS AT ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND AND OUR AT ABOUT NINETY FIVE THOUSAND SO I THINK IT IT JUST KIND OF INDICATES KIND OF SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS THAT CAN OCCUR UP OR DOWN AND THAT'S WHY IT'S DIFFICULT TO KIND OF DO THIS KIND OF LONG TERM PLANNING. WHEN THE PROJECT WAS IN OUR EARS CAN BE SO VARIABLE JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN THE PROJECTIONS THAT CDC ARE PUT ON BE ON THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND THAT THE FACT THAT WHAT THEY'RE PROJECTING 4% DECLINE POPULATION DECLINE. IS THAT WAY TO SET. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE DON'T HAVE. FAITH IN THEM JUST THAT THEY CAN SWING YOU KNOW TEN OR DEPENDING ON. VARIOUS ACTIONS WE WEREN'T ANTICIPATING KOBE AND THAT POPULATION CAN SWING PRETTY DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF. OUTSIDE FACTORS. AND SO IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO SAVE IT. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO. THIS SORT OF FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. BECAUSE OF PROJECTION BETTER FIVE TEN YEARS OUT. BUT YOUR PROJECTIONS ARE NOT ACTUALLY TENURE SOUTH THAT YOU THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE TODAY THERE ARE ABOUT THREE TO FOUR MAYBE FIVE YEARS SO IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY SHORT TERM. WE PASSED LEGISLATION ON A REGULAR BASIS PROJECTING FOR EXAMPLE I WORK A LOT IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE SPACE AND WE'VE BEEN PROJECTING TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY AND WE FELT CONFIDENCE IN THAT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. SO UNDERSTAND HOW. HOW YOU DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROJECTIONS THAT CDC ARE PROVIDED FOR THE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE YEARS. TO HELP US. OUT TO USE THAT. IN COMING UP WITH THE LIST OR INFRASTRUCTURE OUT CAPITAL OUTLAY. IN A INVESTOR P. A. S. BILL WITH ITS PROVIDED AS PART OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTIONS GO OUT ABOUT TEN YEARS. AND THOSE ARE CONJECTURAL AND CONCEPTUAL PROJECTS THAT WERE PROJECTING UP TO ABOUT TEN YEARS. BUT AS MR FORGET MENTION AS PART OF THE DELIVERED OF BUDGET PROCESS EVERY YEAR WE KIND OF ANALYZE AND ASSESS THAT MOST URGENT FIRE LIFE SAFETY NEEDS ARE. COURT MANDATED NEED TO AND WE PROJECT THAT WAS AND INCLUDE THOSE IN THE BUDGET AND- DISCUSS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ON WHAT FUND. SO I'M I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT THE COURT MANDATES. THE DEPARTMENT EITHER HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE FAILED AGAIN- ONE OR ANOTHER AND SO. WHEN IT SEPARATE THOSE FROM THE DISCUSSION FOR A SECOND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE COMPLYING WITH THE COURT'S- WE HAVE MADE. WE SEE THE PRISON POPULATION DECLINING. YET WE SEE THE BUDGET FOR THIS DEPARTMENT INCREASING- OUT. FROM THE SET OF QUESTIONS WE'VE GOTTEN FROM MY COLLEAGUES HERE WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE PRIORITIZING AND WE DON'T HAVE FAITH THAT. WE'RE SPENDING DOLLARS A PROBABLY VOTE BOTH BOTH FOR. THINGS LIKE SAFETY BUT ALSO PROJECT TEAM. THE TYPES OF CULTURAL SHIFTS THAT WE WANT TO SEE IF THERE ARE POLICIES AND IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM. WHAT OUT THERE AND SO HOW DO YOU BEST. HOW DO YOU BEST- PROPOSE WE GET PROJECTIONS ARE WE GET A LIST THAT STARTS TO TAKE INTO THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THINGS THAT POPULATION DECREASING PRESENTS CLOSE SEEN. CHANGING OUR APPROACH TO REHABILITATION. HOW DO YOU BEST THANK WEEK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET. THAT MATRIX SERVING A FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD FROM CDC I THE ADMINISTRATION. WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR MANY YEARS TO SPEND MONEY TO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT IN A SMART WAY. AT THE END ENSURE THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING AND REGULATED ADMINISTRATION APARTMENT HAS BEEN THINGS LIKE HEALTHCARE REHABILITATIVE SERVICES. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THIS YEAR TO KIND OF INCREASE- YOU KNOW CAN BE A COLLEGE ACCESS FOR. INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS SO A LOTOF THE BUDGET INCREASES IN THE MOST RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE- OR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND- AND LIKE YOU MENTIONED IT IS KIND OF A SHIFT IN. HOW WE'RE TREATING INCARCERATED POPULATIONS- AS FAR AS- INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AGAIN WE- WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE I'M KIND OF. YOU KNOW GETTING TO THE RIGHT POINT BUT WE THINK THAT. WHAT WE PUT FORWARD IS BEING. RESPONSIVE TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE AGAIN KIND OF LISTING WHAT PROJECTS WERE PROJECTING RIGHT NOW- AT THIS POINT IN TIME FOR THE NEXT. DECADE OR SO YOUR LAST NAME AND WITH THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THE LEGISLATURE- IT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN- THIS DISCUSSION. STARTED OF VERY SPECIFICALLY AND LAST YEAR WE PUT SOME VERY SPECIFIC STRUCTURE INTO THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS PLANNING. BUT THAT HASN'T THAT'S NOT WHAT WE GOT. IN THIS PROPOSAL SO IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THAT'S A- TRUE STATEMENT AT LEAST FROM ACTION VERSES WORDS THUS FAR- ARE THERE WAYS THAT YOU'LL AT CDCR IS WORKING TO REDUCE THEIR BUDGET. ABSOLUTELY AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW PROPOSED Q. PRISON CLOSURES COMPLETELY IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE ALSO COMPLETELY ELIMINATED CONTRACTS THAT WE PREVIOUSLY HAD WITH OUT OF STATE AND IN STATE CONTRACTED CITIES- SO AT THE POPULATION HAS COME DOWN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN PRO ACTIVELY WORKING ON RIGHT SIZING. THAT PRISON SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEFORE US ARE ACTUALLY JUST CONTINUE TO INCREASE. THE COST AND NOT DECREASE THE COST SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME THAT DISCREPANCY. I THINK THEY'RE DIFFERENT- PROPOSALS THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY AND IN THE ENGINE BAY AS MR VARGAS STATED URBAN PARTLY BASED ON FIRE LIKE SAFETY- KIND OF OTHER URGENT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS- CONCURRENTLY WE'VE ALSO BEEN DOING OTHER WORK TO CLOSE- INSTITUTIONS. THE I. C. C. R. REDUCE THEIR BUDGET BY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THROUGH THE CLOSURE OF I DO OCCASIONALLY TO DETECTION SO. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT THESE PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU ARE REDUCTIONS IN COST BUT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH DECLINES IN POPULATION. DO YOU- DO YOU UNDERSTAND OUR FRUSTRATION AT THIS POINT AS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE S. R. ALLEN- THE LANGUAGE YOU PUT INTO LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TO MAKE IT CLEAR. THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE GOT BRACES WHICH PROVIDED FOR US THE WAY WE KEEP RUNNING IN CIRCLES FOR THE LAST HOUR PLUS HEARING COMMITTEE. I DO UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION AND KIND OF THE PUSH PULL OF IT I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WITH INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING IF IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT TO KIND OF PROJECT OUT HERE WHO NEEDS TO KNOW. IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT STORM THAT HAD OCCURRED I THINK. SIX YEARS AGO OR SO THEY KIND OF STARTED THE ROOF INFRASTRUCTURE. PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN PROPOSING EVERY YEAR- YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT WEATHER EVENTS SOMETHING LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE SOMETHING UNPREDICTABLE MIGHT OCCUR AND THAT WOULD TOP OFF OUR OUR CURRENT PROJECTIONS IT WHICH IS WHY WHEN WE'RE DOING KIND OF DELIBERATE BUDGET PROCESS EVERY YEAR. WE PROJECT WHAT WE NEED AT THAT TIME. THE URGENT ISSUES THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I'M I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE TEN YEARS I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE YOU KNOW- FOR THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN. MY TEN YEARS HERE WE DEFINITELY PLAN AHEAD AND WE PLAN AHEAD INCLUDING THINKING ABOUT. EMERGENCIES WHETHER THAT'S AN EARTHQUAKE- WHETHER THAT'S CLIMATE CHANGE. WEATHER NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PLANNING BETTER FOR. THE NEXT SEARCHING COLLATOR HEALTH SHOULD HAVE HERE- SO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME ON US TO FOR. TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A BLOATED BUDGET WHEN WE SEEM TO MEAN FOR DICK DECLINING POPULATIONS. SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME THE DISCREPANCY THERE Y. SEEMS TO WORK IN SOME CASES BUT NOT OTHERS NOT NOT IN THIS CASE REALLY SPECIFICALLY A CERTAIN BUDGET LINE ITEMS YOU KNOW ON SAY WHAT THE FACILITY COSTS HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY VERSUS OVERALL COSTS BUT AGAIN I THINK THAT. THE EMPHASIS ON INCREASING COSTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OR COURT ORDERED MANDATE SO. AGAIN I AM NOT SURE THAT WE CAN MAKE A COMPARISON ON THE OVERALL DEPARTMENT BUDGET COMPARED TO SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE OR FACILITIES. ARE YOU COMMITTED IT ARE YOU COMMITTED TO THERE ACTUALLY BEING A CHANGER WE JUST TRYING TO. RUN THE CLOCK ON US BEING HERE IS THAT THE BUSINESS AS USUAL CAN CONTINUE. WE'RE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO WORKING FOR HIM LIKE I SAID RIGHT SIZING THE PRISON POPULATION AND THE NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS AND FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE SO WE'RE ABSOLUTELY AWARE OF BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. THANKS ARE GIVEN THAT COMMITMENT THAT YOU JUST REITERATED TO ALL OF US I THINK IT WOULD BE PRUDENT FOR YOU TO TAKE. THEIR VEGAS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ABOUT A MATRIX OF HIGHER MAKING DECISION THE- FEDERAL REPORTING LANGUAGE AND THE BUDGET AND WHEN YOU COME BACK TO US- PERCENT- INFORMATION A SEARCH TO ANSWER OUR- QUESTIONS THAT THIS ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE A PARTNERSHIP- AND THE COMMITMENT FEELS. TRUE AS WELL. AND SO ALL RIGHT PLEASE TAKE OUR QUESTIONS AS CLEAR THE SATISFACTION AS THE TEACHER I WOULD SAY AT THIS. ASSIGNMENT IS NOT JUST A COMPLETE BUT MISINTERPRETED AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO QUICKLY INTERPRETED HOW TO DO IT PROPERLY AND THAT MR JONES SAWYER SIR WE ARE HERE TO HELP YOU SEE IF YOU NEED US HELP TO CLARIFY WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE- MORE THAN WILLING TO DO THAT. WE'RE GOING TO GONNA GO AHEAD AND- CLOSE OFF THIS DISCUSSION FOR TODAY I WILL REVISIT AGAIN WHEN I THINK MY COLLEAGUES ARE GOING TO WANT TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND TAMMY IRWIN I MEAN I TEAM MANAGER TO AT CBC ARTS ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SERVICES. FIFTY FIFTY PROVIDE SPENDING AND POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE STATEWIDE EXPANSION AND UPGRADE OF THE MANAGED ACCESS SYSTEMS. MANAGE ACCESS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S CONTRABAND CELLULAR PHONE INTERDICTION STRATEGY AND IT'S DESIGNED TO DISRUPT CONTRABAND PHONE COMMUNICATIONS ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO INTERFERE WITH AND DISMANTLE CONTRABAND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. CONTRABAND DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE SAFETY AND OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION. STAFF AND THE PUBLIC NEGATIVE OUTCOMES INCLUDING VICTIMIZATION CITIZENS POSSIBILITIES WITHIN THE INCARCERATED POPULATION I DIDN'T RISK OVERDOSE AND THE INTERFERENCE WITH AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO A SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION. CONTRABAND CELLPHONES DELIVER A LINK BETWEEN INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND OUTSIDE ACTORS ENABLING THE CONTINUOUS OPERATION OF CONTRABAND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. CDC ARE PROPOSES THE UPGRADE OF THE MANAGED ACCESS SYSTEMS AT THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES AREN'T SITUATIONS WHERE IT CURRENTLY EXISTS AND EXPANSION OF THE INVOLVED TECHNOLOGY TO THE REMAINING ADULT INSTITUTIONS. DEPUTY DIRECTOR JARED LEVINE OUT FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND I. ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. CAITLIN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE THINK THAT THE IDEA OF INSTALLING NEW CELLPHONE INTERDICTION TECHNOLOGY. THAT NOT ON. NOW WITH. IT WAS THE ONE THAT WAS ON. THEFT PARKING. CAITLIN O'NEILL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE FIND THAT THE IDEA OF INSTALLING NEW CELLPHONE INTERDICTION TECHNOLOGY AT PRISONS APPEARS REASONABLE AS IT COULD HELP REDUCE CRIME BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF PRISON. HOWEVER WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED COULD RESULT IN THE INFLATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY AT PRISONS THAT ARE CLOSE SHORTLY THEREAFTER. AND THAT'S BECAUSE UNDER THE PROPOSAL CDCR WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING TO INSTALL THE TECHNOLOGY AT- ALL THREE OF ITS STATE OWNED AND CURRENTLY OPERATED PRISONS- YET AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THE STATE THE POPULATION DECLINE- SUGGESTS THAT THE STATE COULD BE AN- A POSITION TO CLOSE AROUND FIVE PRISONS. OVER THAT SAME TIME PERIOD THAT BEAT TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE ROLLED OUT UNDER THE PROPOSAL. A ROUGHLY AROUND THE SAME TIME PERIOD. I'M SO TO REDUCE THE RISK OF INSTALLING CELLPHONE INTERDICTION TECHNOLOGY AT PRISONS THAT ARE SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSE WE RECOMMEND ONE. PROVIDING FUNDING ONLY FOR A PUT A PORTION OF THE PRISONS. AND TO ENSURING THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS ONLY INSTALLED AT PRISONS THAT ARE NOT STRONG CANDIDATES FORECLOSURE. AND SAYS PACIFIC WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE IMPROVE APPROVE ONLY FUNDING FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS AS LAID OUT IN THE PROPOSALS SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE EIGHT. PRISONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND TWELVE PRISONS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR- AND REJECT FOR NOW THE REMAINING PRESENTS. AND THEN SECOND BEFORE- PROVIDING THE FUNDING WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING CDCR TO PROVIDE A LIST OF WHAT TURNED TWENTY PRESENT IT WOULD INSTALL THE TECHNOLOGY AT- SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT LIST DOESN'T- THAT LIST ONLY INCLUDES PRISONS THAT ARE NOT STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE. AND THAT I GENERALLY NEED PRISONS THAT PROVIDE A CENTRAL OR PURCHASING A SPECIALIZED HEALTHCARE SERVICES OR- ARE CAPABLE OF HOUSING INMATES WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF CLASSIFICATIONS OF SECURITY CLASSIFICATIONS XCERRA. AND OF COURSE EASIER COULD COME BACK AND REQUEST. FUNDING FOR THE REMAINING PRESENT IN THE FUTURE WHEN THAT THERE'S A CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT- AND HOW MANY PRISONS WOULD BE WILL BE ULTIMATELY CLOSED. I ALSO KNOW THAT TAKING THE STAGE APPROACH TO FUNDING THE TECH THE EXPANSION OF THE TECHNOLOGY COULD ALSO IMPROVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. OF ITS ROLLOUT- TO ENSURE THAT SAID THAT TECHNOLOGY IS IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES. THANK YOU. HI AND LENITION MATTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AT THIS TIME THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT IDENTIFIED ANY ADDITIONAL CLOSURES AS AS WE'VE DISCUSSED- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUE TO INVEST IN STATE INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE INCARCERATED POPULATION STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY. I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY IN THIS PROPOSAL DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS A MULTI YEAR ROLLOUT SHOULD A PERSON BE IDENTIFIED FOR CLOSURE AFTER THE EQUIPMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN INSTALLED THE EQUIPMENT CAN BE RELOCATED TO ANOTHER PERSON- IF THE NEW EQUIPMENT HAS YET TO BE INSTALLED THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ENHANCED CELLULAR INTERDICTION WILL BE RETURNED TO THE GENERAL FUND THROUGH THE BUDGETING PROCESS WHEN CLOSING THAT PERSON SUB COMMITTEE THAT ENHANCE CELLULAR INTERDICTION IT'S AN IMPORTANT SAFETY MEASURE TO DISABLE THE ILLEGAL USE OF CELLPHONES. WITHIN THE PRISONS THAT THEY CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SKIPS GANG ACTIVITY NARCOTICS DISTRIBUTION AS WELL AS VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHER INCARCERATED PEOPLE. STAFF AND PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU. SO GIVEN. I WOULD SAY THIS- GIVEN GIVEN THAT IT'S NOT WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR LONG TERM. PLAN FOR PRESSING CLOSER SEVEN OTHERS COMMITMENTS FOR THAT- CAN THE CDC ARE OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SPEAK TO L. A. O.'S RECOMMENDATION THAT WE DO THIS IN STAGGERING. PROCESS. SURE AS% I SAID I BELIEVE IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A STACK OF PROCESS ALREADY BECAUSE IT ROLLS OUT OVER MULTIPLE YEARS- SHOULD AS PRISON ALTERNATELY DECIDE. HE DECIDED A CULTURE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE MOVED TO A DIFFERENT PRISON OR IF THAT PERSON HAS NOT RECEIVED INSTALLATION OF THAT YET THAT FUNDING WOULD BE RETURNED TO THE GENERAL FUND ASSOCIATIVE THAT PRISON'S CLOSURE. BUT IF WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A STAGGERED PROCESS WHERE WE ASKING FOR ALL THE MONEY UP FRONT AND NOT BUDGETING THAT IN A STANDARD WAY. I BELIEVE. MANY PROPOSALS ARE OFTEN DONE IN A MULTIPLE YEAR ROLLOUT PHASE THAT'S JUST HOW THE EQUIPMENT WILL BE INSTALLED ON THIS ONE SURE THAT ALL PRISONERS RECEIVE. THE SECURITY MEASURES NEEDED. BUT DO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IT'S NOT OFFICES BUT IF I SEE OUR PRESENCE THAT WILL REMAIN. OPEN. I CANNOT FUNDING COULD BE. TAKEN DOWN WHEN THEY'RE IF A PRISON CLOSURES ALTERNATELY DECIDED. BUT THAT DOESN'T-ACCOUNT FOR WHERE YOU TO SOME OF THAT IN SOME PRISONS. WE MIGHT INSTALLED. WE MIGHT INSTALL THE EQUIPMENT AND THEN AFTER THE MATTER. CHOOSE TO CLOSE ON THE PERSON. SO THAT WOULD STILL HAVE AN CRITICS SPENCER THEM WITH UNNECESSARY. I'M NOT EQUIPMENT COULD BE REPURPOSED AND MOVE TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION- IT'S STILL THE TECHNOLOGY IS EVOLVING FOR. FURTHER TESTS- AND WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE PRISONS BY DISABLING THOSE ILLEGAL CELLPHONES. SO WE AGREE THAT THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. ITEM TO INVEST AND WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE INVESTING IN IT AND IN A THOUGHTFUL MANNER. AND IF THIS IS GOING TO BE. SPREAD OUT OVER TIME IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE THAT AS WE GET INFORMATION WE- ALLOCATE MONIES IN THE FUTURE AND NOT. NOW THAT WE MIGHT ENCOURAGE SOME UNNECESSARY SPENDING. DO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. MISTER JONES SAWYER AND ASSERTING. I LARA AYE I THINK WE'RE ALL IN FAVOR OF THIS BUT THE SECULAR INTERDICTION TECHNOLOGY I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND ANYONE THAT THAT'S AGAINST IT AD IN FACT- WE PROBABLY SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY. WE CAN TEST ITS ACCOUNTABILITY IS RELIABILITY IS EFFECTIVENESS WHETHER THAT'S THE NUMBER OF- CONTRABAND AT STATE SEIZE WHILE YOU HAVE IT THEIR NUMBER FONG CELLPHONES THEY RECEIVED IT CAN WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF- VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENS. IN PRISON DOESN'T GO DOWN AS A RESULT OF PUTTING NEEDS IN IT ISN'T TANGIBLE THINGS THAT WE CAN TEST YOUR COME BACK. TO THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS BASIC SAY SINCE WE PUT. THIS TECHNOLOGY IMPRISONED HEY. IT'S IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IS IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF INMATES AND GUARDS- PROPORTIONALLY BY X. AMOUNT AND THIS IS WHY THIS IS A GREAT NOT A GOOD AND- TECHNOLOGY PRODUCES GREAT TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BENEFICIAL. TO THE- TO CDC ARE AS A WHOLE I THINK YOU MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING THAT COULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL AND- IF YOU'RE ABLE TO CAPTURE ITS BENEFITS OF ULTIMATELY- IT NOT ONLY WOULD IT SPREAD TO THE OTHER PRISONS. BUT AS NEW TECHNOLOGY COMES OUT BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW- CRIMINALS ARE VERY SMART NO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET AROUND THIS WE MAY HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE SOPHISTICATED. WILL INVEST THAT BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE THE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. IS THE BEST THING FOR A- FOR OUR PRISON POPULATION AND THE PRISON GUARDS SO IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD. COME UP WITH WITH THE ALGORITHM OR- SOME KIND OF CODE THAT CAN SHOW US HOW EFFECTIVE. USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD BE. OR IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GOT TO COME BACK TO US WITH. HELLO I BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD NEED TO COME BACK TO YOU THERE ARE SEVERAL MITIGATING FACTORS AT THAT WAY INTO WHAT AND CHANGES THE BEHAVIOR AND THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE PRESENT- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT- THAT BLOCKING A CELL PHONES AND INTERDICTING. CONTRABAND FROM COMING INTO THE PRESENCE IS OVER ALL AND VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE DEPARTMENT- BUT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT- WAYS OF COLLECTING THAT DATA- EVEN MORE THAN WE ALREADY DO. TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT BACK WITH ME WITH THE ASSEMBLY. CAN YOU GIVE US LIKE AN OUTLINE OF WHAT THAT COULD POSSIBLY LOOK AT LIKE AS YOU. AS YOU COME BACK TO IT AGAIN FOUR FOUR ESPECIALLY TO DO THIS IN A TIERED STAGGERED MANNER THAT YOU CAN COME BACK IN. AND THEY REALLY HAVE SOME GOOD DATA OF WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT- A MAN I HAVE SO MUCH FAITH IN IT THAT I KNOW TO COME. IF YOU IF YOU ANALYZE IT UP FRONT. ONE DISK COMMITTEE IN AND- WILL OVERWHELMINGLY BE IN FAVOR OF EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. I DO KNOW THAT WE ARE ALREADY TRACKING- AND- A LOT AROUND THE CONFISCATED CELLPHONES AND CONFISCATED- OTHER CONTENT FROM THE CONTRABAND- BUT I DO THINK THAT WE COULD- PULL THEM TOGETHER STEM AND YEAH- MEASUREMENTS. SOME METRICS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO- BASELINE AND THEN BRING BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE- WHEN WE CAN SHOW- WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY DOING ESPECIALLY AFTER IT'S BEEN UPGRADED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEASURES JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT WE MEASURE WAS TALKING ABOUT SO- I GUESS WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT I HEARD FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WAS THAT- THEY WANT TO HAVE A MULTI YEAR APPROACH BECAUSE- THEY HAVE A MULTI YEAR PLAN ON THIS PROPOSAL BUT WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE- FOR MISTER BORK IS THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE YEAR TO YEAR WITH ALL THE FACILITIES PLANNING SO WHICH- SOME CONFUSED WHICH ONE IS IT. WE CAN PLAN OUR WE DO EVERYTHING YEAR TO YEAR. BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD WE WERE HEARING DIFFERENT THINGS FROM. DIFFERENT FACTIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT. LET ME SHATTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND THIS TECHNOLOGY TO ALL THE INSTITUTIONS AND REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING PACE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY OUT WE FEEL FUNDING FOR ALL INSTITUTIONS NOW- WELL FUNDING ISN'T AVAILABLE TO EXPAND TO ALL INSTITUTIONS AND WE DON'T WANT TO GET IN A POSITION WHERE A FEW YEARS DOWN THE LINE WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH. AVAILABLE FUNDING AND WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL SECURITY AT ALL INSTITUTIONS. OKAY BUT HOW THE HOW HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT EVERY FOR EVERY. FACILITY NEEDS THIS TECHNOLOGY WHEN YOU CAN DETERMINE THE PREVIOUS ITEM- WHAT ITEMS WHICH ITEMS NEED IMPROVING AT DIFFERENT FACILITIES. SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS DON'T HVE BEST MANAGE ACCESS OUR SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY IT ALSO CURRENTLY EIGHTEEN OF THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE SOME LEVEL OF THIS SECURITY HOWEVER IT'S NOT- HOW DOUBLE AT FIVE G. TECHNOLOGY SO THIS IS REALLY TO EXPAND TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THIS AVAILABLE. AND KEEP PACE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S EVOLVING- WE DON'T WHAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT WE REALLY CAN- REDUCE. THE DESIRE FOR CELL PHONES BY DISABLING THEM. THANK GOD I GOT IT SO THAT IN THE TIMELINE AGAINST THIS POSES ON. THE ONE LISTED IN THE REPORT WHERE IT'S- ALL THE- OVER FROM NOW TOLD TWENTY TWENTY SIX IS WHEN ALL THE FACILITIES WOULD BE DONE. YES THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY I DON'T KNOW I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER BUT STILL I THINK IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO ME HOW YOU COULD BE SO SURE SO MANY YEARS OUT ABOUT THIS PROGRAM BUT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR ABOUT YOUR OTHER PROGRAMS. SO OKAY THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. OKAY OF WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE ENOUGH FOR ISSUE NUMBER THREE WE HAVE. MULTIPLE PANELS- WITHIN- WITHIN AND SO WE WILL GO WE WILL HEAR FROM. FROM EACH PANEL AND THEN WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE SO JUST TO RECAP PANEL ONE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT GRANT PROGRAM. PANEL TO VERTICAL PROSECUTION AND PENALTY COUNTER DRUG TASK FORCE PROGRAM EXPANSION SORRY POLITICS PANEL FOR DOJ ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME ENTERPRISE PROGRAM AND DOJ TASK FORCE PROGRAM SO WE WILL HEAR FROM THE PANELISTS FOR EACH ONE AND WE WILL ASK QUESTIONS AFTER EACH PANEL. FOR EACH ONE ONE AT THE SUB SUB ISSUES SO WE MAY BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST. THE FIRST ONE ORGANIZED WITHOUT THE F. GRANT PROGRAM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KATIE HOWARD WITH THE PSPC IS THE AUDIO OKAY. YES GREAT THANK YOU I'M STARTING ON THE- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM- AS IS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA THIS IS A PROPOSAL FOR A COMPETITIVE GRANT. UP WITH EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND THIS YEAR AND THEN THE NEXT TWO BUDGET YEARS AS WELL SO TOTAL OF THREE YEARS- THAT IS TO BE AWARDED COMPETITIVELY TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES- TO COMBAT ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME. AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE WOULD INCLUDE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS COUNTY SHERIFF'S AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS- MISTER JONES SAWYER ON THIS COMMITTEE IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SEC'S COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS PROGRAMS- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BUT I JUST WANTED TO. ALSO MENTION A COUPLE OF THOUGHT ON THAT I'M AWARE HAVE HAVE COME QUESTIONS THAT ACCOMPANY THE COMMITTEE ABOUT. WHY IS THAT IT MINISTRATION IS PRIORITIZING THESE RESOURCES TO COMBAT ORGANIZED RETAIL FACT- INSTEAD FOCUS WAY WHEN THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES AND I THINK THE- PERSPECTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THIS IS A PROPOSAL. THAT ADDRESSES THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN OF CONCERN CERTAINLY ARE TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE ADMINISTRATION BUT I THINK TOO MANY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT OVER THE LAST YEAR IN PARTICULAR AS ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT ISSUES HAVE. CERTAINLY THAT SPOTLIGHT IT APPEARS AN INTEREST IN FINDING SOME COMPETITIVE GRANTS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THAT'S JUST A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL. CAITLIN O'NEILL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PART OF A BROADER PUBLIC SEEK SAFETY PACKAGE CONSISTING OF NINE PROPOSALS ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS TOTALING A HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND DECLINING TO. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN. OF THE NINE PROPOSALS FIVE HAVE THE GOAL OF THE BROAD GOAL OF REDUCING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT TWO OF ADDRESSING FIREARMS AND TO DEAL WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING OR OTHER CRIMES. WE PROVIDE OUR DETAILED ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN A RECENT PUBLICATION- AND WE HAVE HARD COPIES HERE IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. I'M GOING TO GIVE SOME A BRIEF SUMMARY SUMMARY OF OUR OVER ARCHING COMMENTS ON THE PACKAGE AND THEN DISCUSSED SOME CONCERNS ON THIS PARTICULAR- PROPOSAL MY COLLEAGUE MISLI WILL ALSO BE PROVIDING COMMENTS ON. LATER COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE ARE PACKED COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE THAT COME UP IN LATER- PANELS. I'M SO MOVING ON TO MY OVER ARCHING COMMENTS WE RAISE NO CONCERNS WITH TO THE PROPOSALS TOTALING SEVEN MILLION- ONE OF WHAT WHICH IS COMING UP IN A LATER PANEL. TODAY REGARDING THE REMAINING FUNDING. IT TO MEET THOSE GOALS AND THEN ALIGN THE RESOURCES ACCORDINGLY TO ENSURE THAT THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE MET. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PLAN WHICH AS I MENTIONED GENERALLY TARGETS THESE. BROAD GOALS OF REDUCING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- ADDRESSING FIREARMS AND REDUCING DRUG TRAFFICKING AND OTHER CRIMES. LACKS CLEAR AND SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES FOR ACHIEVING EACH OF THOSE SCHOOLS WHICH MAKES IT- QUITE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE PROPOSALS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE- FOR EXAMPLE THE TYPES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES THAT CAN FALL UNDER ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CAN BE QUITE BROAD. CAN RANGE FROM TWO PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER TO STEAL MERCHANDISE TO RETURN IT FOR STORE CREDIT. ON TO A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT IS EXPLOITING PEOPLE POTENTIALLY AND STEALING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE AND SELLING IT ONLINE. SO WITHOUT A CLEAR- OBJECTIVE ADDS IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHICH TYPE OR- WHAT ASPECT OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT THE GOVERNOR'S INTENDING TO TARGET- WHICH IN TURN MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO IT- SS WORD WHETHER THE PROPOSED STRATEGIES WOULD- OR OR WHAT OTHER ACTIONS WOULD MAKE SENSE TO EFFECTIVELY TARGETED. AT TARGET THE OBJECTIVES- WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. TO ASSIST THE LEGISLATURE IN DEVELOPING ITS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES- OUR PUBLICATION PREVENTS PRESENTS DATA ON CRIME AND FIREARM TRENDS TRENDS AS WELL AS SOME OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AT OUR FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH HEARING- AND SO NOW I'M GOING TO DISCUSS VERY BRIEFLY SOME CRIME TRENDS TO THE M. FOR- THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AT THAT THINKS ABOUT ITS PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS- AND BROADLY CRIME DATA WE FOUND SUGGEST THAT THE GOVERNOR SPECIFIC GOALS MAY NOT BE VERY WELL TARGETED. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHILE THERE'S NO OFFICIAL DATA ON ALL RETAIL THEFT- SHOPLIFTING DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY- PRELIMINARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE DATA FROM FOUR LARGE CITIES DOES SUGGEST THAT OVERALL LARCENY. WHICH INCLUDE SHOPLIFTING IS INCREASING BUT IT HASN'T YET RETURNED TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WE FOUND AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY INSTEAD WANT TO FOCUS ON ADDRESSING RECENT CONCERNING INCREASES IN HOMICIDES AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS AND MOTOR VEHICLE RELATED THEFT. I WOULD JUST NOTE HOWEVER THAT- SOME EXPERTS AND RETAILERS HAVE NOTED THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE AN INCREASE IN BRAZEN F. AND- OVERALL SOPHISTICATION OF SHOPLIFTERS- THIS IS LARGELY ANECDOTAL THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY GOOD- STATEWIDE DATA ON THAT ALTHOUGH NONETHELESS COULD. BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT- AND I'D ALSO NOTE THAT- WHILE CRIMES THEM STATEWIDE MAY NOT BE SHOWING- AS A CONCERNING TREND ON RETAIL THEFT- THERE COULD BE-REASON TO LOOK AT- LOCAL AREAS OF CONCERN AS THAT IS THE CASE THAT CRIME TRENDS OFTEN VERY QUITE A BIT BY. REGION AND TYPE OF CRIME. AND THEN FINALLY TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING CRIME RELATED GOALS OUR PUBLICATION PROVIDE SOME OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHICH BROADLY- ARE IN THE CATEGORIES ESSENTIALLY OF EXPANDING ON EXISTING PROGRAMS OR PILOTING RESEARCH BASED SOLUTIONS FOR EXAMPLE EXAMPLE TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO TARGET THAT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- THEIR RESEARCH BASED TOOLS AND BEST PRACTICES THAT COULD BE SCALED UP LIKE. USE OF STRATEGICALLY PLACED CAMERAS OR THEN FINALLY- GIVEN THAT THE OVERALL CRIME RATE IS RELATIVELY LOW I'M PARTICULARLY BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS IT COULD BE REASONABLE TO PRIORITIZE OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS THAT ARE NOT. DIRECTLY RELATED TO CRIME REDUCTION. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AND- VERY QUICKLY I WILL I WILL JUST MENTION OUR CONCERNS- ON THIS. PARTICULAR GRANT PROGRAM IN PANEL ONE WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO THE GRANT PROGRAM AND PANEL TO BOTH OF WHICH ARE ADDRESSING ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. AND SPECIFICALLY WERE CONCERNED THAT THE- GRANT PROGRAM AS PROPOSED WOULD PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY TO BE A SIXTY AFTER THE BUDGET IS ENACTED WHICH WOULD MAKE IT. VERY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT LEAST AT THIS POINT HOW THE MONEY WOULD ULTIMATELY BE ALLOCATED AND USED AND IN TURN- IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER ULTIMATELY THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED EFFECTIVELY. IT ALSO MAKES IT HARD TO RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE GRANTS WOULD SUPPLANT LOCAL. FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE FUNDING WOULD GO TOWARD. INCREASING LAW ENFORCEMENT PATROL OF RETAIL LOCATIONS. OR BE USED FOR EXAMPLE TO PURCHASE- CAMERAS OR OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD. ACHIEVE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES- AND POTENTIALLY BE A MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF LIMITED TERM FUNDING. THIS IS THIS CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS AND I AM AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. I JUST NEWMAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY WITH PANEL ONE IS TO KIND OF EMPHASIZE AND ENCOMPASS THE WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH AND PROVIDE FUNDING FOR LOCALS TO COMBAT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- WE THINK IT'S PART OF A LARGE. LOCAL AND STATE KIND OF PACKAGE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE- HOLISTICALLY AND MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROPOSAL- YES. THANK YOU WE'VE. AREAS A SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY'RE PURCHASING AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE A C. H. B. TAX TOUGH. C. H. B. TASK FORCE. INCLUDING THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN SACRAMENTO DO WE KNOW IF THESE ARE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- OR JUST HOW HOW DID WE MAKE. HOW DID WE GET TO THAT POSITION CAN WE START THERE AGAIN I THINK. WE DECIDED TO EXPAND THE H. P. DID THOSE. SPECIFIC LOCATION BECAUSE WE HAD SEEN. DR IN THOSE AREAS ARE THOSE THE ONLY AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A CHP TASK FORCE. I CAN'T WAIT THIS SPECIFIC AREA THAT SEEKS PETER OR DOESN'T COVER SO I'M I DIFFER TO THEM ON. WHAT PARTS OF THIS BEST- SO I IT WHICH IS. I THINK WE MIGHT THINK I'LL AND THEN OF COURSE THAT WE ALL SHE- DID HE SAID TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- BEING RESPONSE TO THEIR DEFINITELY BEEN AND- IN THE NEWS PER WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO THE IN THE SMALL. WAY THAT ARE DAHLE TAX IN AB. IN A WAY THAT READ THIS- THOSE HEADLINE AND THAT RETAIL THEFT OUT THERE AND SO. AND SO MY QUESTION IS THAT OUR LINE OF QUESTIONS ARE COMING FROM FROM THAT PLACE AND WE START THERE AND SO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN SACRAMENTO MIGHT BE. GOOD PLACES TO START IS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MAYBE YOU. WE'RE NOT FORGETTING OTHER PLACES I MIGHT NEED THIS AS WELL- AND SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WITHOUT QUESTION IS COMING FROM TO A THEME BASED. ON ON CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LIMITED GROUP THE STAKEHOLDERS OUT THERE AND SO THAT'S MY FIRST CONCERN THERE MY SECOND CONCERN IS THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WE HAVE ANY SORT OF METRICS TO ENSURE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE ACTUALLY BEING USED IN THE WAYS IN THE WAY THAT WE INTENDED. AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OPEN TO FINDING SOME SORT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR THAT THE SELLERS ARE BEING USED APPROPRIATELY. I JUST NEWMAN PART IN A FINANCE WERE MORE THAN HAPPY THE ADMINISTRATION IS AND PART OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS TO WORK THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE STEERING PROCESS AS WE DEVELOP THE GRANTS AND KIND OF MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TO ENSURE THAT. THE MONEY IS BETTER SPENT ARE ACCURATELY TRACKING IN KIND OF REPORTED BY THE LOCAL AGENCIES THAT BY FOREIGN IN OUR ULTIMATELY AWARDED THESE GRANTS. SO I SO LET ME BE CLEAR AT WHAT MY NEXT QUESTION AND EVEN THIS ONE THAT WE'RE HOPING TO GET THIS INFORMATION BEFORE WE APPROPRIATE THE SELLERS AND THAT AFTER. THE MATTER- IT THINK EVER GOING TO HONOR OUR DUTY WE NEED THAT INFORMATION AHEAD OF TIME AND SO WITH THAT MY QUESTION IS. WHEN WILL BE WHEN WILL WE BE RECEIVING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW. THESE GRANTS WILL OCCUR WITH THE FACT THAT THE GRANTS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN APPLY FOR WHAT THE PERMISSIBLE USE OF THE FUNDING. HOW ARE YOU GONNA MEASURE THE IMPACT OF THE FUNDING WHEN WILL WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE. IF I MAY A JOB AND THIS IS KATIE HOW WITH THE- OFTEN AS THE LARGEST. CAN NEW GRANT PROGRAMS AND THAT THE BCC IS ASKED TO ADMINISTER. THEIR IN THE PAST BEEN- SOME. PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE OR BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT REALLY SPELLS OUT WITH SOME SPECIFICITY. SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE GOALS AND SO WE WOULD BE OF COURSE ABSOLUTELY- INTERESTED AND OPEN TO. WORKING WITH YOU ON SOME OF THOSE CRITERIA. THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO ADD IN WE HEARD YOU ASKED TODAY ABOUT. WHAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ABOUT RATES OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT ACROSS THE STATE AND WE CAN CERTAINLY TRY TO PUT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER. BUT- IN GENERAL ARE THINGS LIKE- TYPES OF ACTIVITIES OR PROGRAMS OR EVEN TECHNOLOGY IT'S A TRUCK. THAT MIGHT BE A HIGHER PRIORITY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE THOSE KINDS OF ADDITIONAL- DETAILED RULES COULD CERTAINLY BE FELT TEN AS PART OF BUDGET PROCESS. FOR THE GRANT SPOKE OUT. AND THEN I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT I WOULD LEAST LIKE TO AT LEAST OFFER SOME- INSURANCE PERHAPS IS THAT SINCE THIS IS A COMPETITIVE GRANT- ANY. LOOKED SECTION THAT WANTS TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDING NEEDS TO PROVIDE A PERSUASIVE STATEMENT OF NEED. AND THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE RATING CRITERIA- ON WHICH THEIR SUPPORT THAT GOAL CERTAINLY AND THE STRUCTURE OF OUR- DC GRANTED. PROCESS IS TO SAY LET'S HAVE A LOOK. ON PROPOSALS B. AS- BASED ON THE NEED THAT THAT COMES IN ON THE PROPOSAL'S. IT'S THOSE TWO DISTINCT THINGS CERTAINLY ADDITIONAL. LANGUAGE CAN BE ADDED HERE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND- WE WOULD HAVE. HAD IT. PROCESS THAT. THAT WOULD SERVE TO- FUNDED PROGRAMS WERE THE HIGHEST NEEDS ARE IDENTIFIED. AND THEN FINALLY ON THE PLANTATION WHICH WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE L. A. ARE RAISED. WE ALWAYS SPECIFIED IN GRANT AGREEMENT THAT THE FUNDING HAS TO BE FOR NEW ACTIVITIES. AND CAN'T SUPPLY. SO I WANT TO. JUST MENTION THAT AS. WELL THANKS. DO WE A MATRIX OF. A PERSUASIVE. APPLICATION MY- HELPED HER STICTION SALES WORRY ABOUT EQUITY- ONE- SEPARATE FOR THAT MAKING SURE THAT. IT WASN'T JUST PERSUASIVE AND PAPER BUT THAT IT WAS EFFECTIVE IN PRACTICE. AS WELL AS WELL AS WE CONTINUE TO THIS PROCESS THOSE DETAILS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO US. AND THIS. BHOSLE COMPLETELY FAIR QUESTION- WE CAN BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH EXAMPLES FROM OTHER GRANTS BUT I THINK THE CONTENT OF THIS ONE IS DISTINCT SO- YOU KNOW. WHATEVER THE PRIORITY CERTAINLY EQUITY IS IMPORTANT AS WELL- THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONCE DEVELOP THEN WE WOULD THEN HAVE THE GRANTS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. FLOW DIRECTLY FROM WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE- AND THE BUDGET PROCESS HAS DICTATED I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE. SO LET'S JUST THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WILL WORK WITH US TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE HERE- METRICS- TO ENSURE THE FUNDING IS BEING USED PROPERLY AND CLEAR METRICS FOR HOW YOU QUALIFY FOR OUR GRAND THE SISAL STRANDS BEFORE. WE ADOPT THIS BUDGET. YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T- TYPICALLY THINGS LIKE THE SIZE OF INDIVIDUAL GRANTS IS- LEFT FOR A COMMITTEE OF A VARIETY OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS- TO DETERMINE TO WORK THROUGH AND DETERMINE BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO SAY YOU KNOW THAT TO SET SOME LIMITS ON THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WITHIN YOUR- YOU KNOW. ABILITY TO DO. SO TO BE CLEAR THOUGHT ABOUT SETTING LIMITS OF SO FORTH WHICH IS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE YOU SEEN BEING USED EFFECTIVELY- AND WE'RE GOING TO BE CONFIDENT IN TELLING THE TAXPAYERS. HOW ARE YOU SEEING THEIR TAX DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT ACTUALLY WANT TO GIVE MY COLLEAGUES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A AS THE DIGITAL QUESTIONS MISTER LUCKY. YEAH THANK YOU I'D FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE GOVERNOR FOR OF KNOWLEDGE IN. THIS HUGE PROBLEM- THIS IS A VERY VERY BIG PROBLEM. AND AS A MATTER OF FACT I BELIEVE THAT PART OF OUR- FRUSTRATION. IS AS- WAS ANNOUNCED EARLIER THAT. THE THE NUMBERS ARE INDICATING THAT- THIS IS NOT AS BIG A PROBLEM AS IT REALLY IS AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE. LACK OF REAL DATA. ON SHOWING HOW WIDESPREAD AND HOW DEEP. THIS PROBLEM HAS BECOME- I KNOWS TO PUBLIC SAFETY A REALITY THAT- MY DAUGHTER WHO RECENTLY WAS EMPLOYED BY RETAILER. WAS INSTRUCTED BY HER SUPERVISION. THAT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY OBSERVE SOMEBODY. STEALING A GARMENT THAT THEY WERE NOT EVEN TO BRING ATTENTION TO IT. MUCH LESS REPORTED. SO I COULD TELL YOU THAT'S THE REALITY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID- THEY DON'T WANT VIOLENCE THEY DON'T WANT ALL THE NEGATIVE- CONSEQUENCES OF REPORTING AND SO WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT- BY THIS PROGRAMMING. BRINGING ATTENTION TO THIS PROBLEM THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE RETAILERS WILL BE MORE ENGAGED TO COOPERATE. AND TO GIVE US SOME REAL DATA SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE SEVERITY OF THIS PROBLEM. AND WE CAN A DESK ADDRESS IT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. AND YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS HOT OF MONEY. SO I'M HOPING THAT WE WILL DIRECTED IN A WAY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY COLLECT- GOOD INFORMATION. AND WE CAN TRACK OUTCOMES THAT CAN HELP US. OF ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IN SOME KIND OF MEANINGFUL WAY AND NOT JUST SUPERFICIALLY- I'M VERY VERY EXCITED FOR. THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING. THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- BECAUSE WE'RE ALL IMPACTED BY IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND SO. I'M THANKFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZING THIS AND IT MAY NOT BE EXACTLY THE- OF AS MEANINGFUL AS- WE COULD MAKE IT BUT- IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR IT. AND I JUST HOPE THAT WE WILL BE SMART AND THE WAY THAT WE IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM AND THAT WE WILL ADDRESS IT IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY HAS MEANING. AND WHAT KIND OF SERVICE A DETRIMENT TO THOSE WHO ARE CHOOSING TO- EXPLOIT OTHER PEOPLE- ESPECIALLY RETAILERS THAT IT'S BECOME VERY VERY HURTFUL AND I'M VERY EXCITED FOR SOME GOOD OUTCOMES. THANK YOU MR LACKEY AND- NOT PURSUE THIS WITH THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL TO ME. AS THE AUTHOR OF THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT BILL AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO. THEN WHEN IT SUNSET IT GOT IT RE. PATTERSON SAID EXTENDED- I WAS OVER- OVERJOYED WHEN THE GOVERNOR CAME OUT WITH ADDITIONAL MONEY NOT ONLY FOR THIS PROGRAM BUT THEY ALSO SAY THAT IN ITS PRESENT FORM IT WAS WORKING UNDER CHP AND I DON'T THINK THE CHP GETS ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THE INCREDIBLE JOB THAT THEY'VE DONE IN IN IN IN THE SUCCESSES THAT THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN. PROSECUTING PEOPLE WITH FELONIES AND DEALING WITH PEOPLE ON THE MISDEMEANOR LEVEL AND GETTING THEM TO PROGRAMS- AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE SOMEONE WROTE ORGANIZATIONS DO AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB. AND WE JUST KIND OF IGNORED IT AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE COMMEND THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL FOR THE FOR THEIR ROLE. IN GETTING THIS DONE- A BUDGET THAT THE VOTING THE REAL PROBLEM IS- THE CONFLICTING INFORMATION WHETHER OR NOT IT WHETHER IT'S HIGHER OR LOWER- THE REAL PROBLEM IS FEAR. IT COULD BE WE COULD BE AT ZERO. AND PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT CRIME IS UP AND FEARFUL. THIS EMOTIONAL. YOU KNOW PERCEPTION IS REALITY AND IF THEY BELIEVE THAT- CRIME IS UP AND THE FEAR OF CRIME THEN THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN. WE CAN DO ABOUT IT STATISTICALLY RITUAL THE MODEST OF TEXAS YOU WANT BUT IF THEY ARE AFRAID. TO COME OTHER HOMES BECAUSE THEY SEE HOMELESS PEOPLE WALKING AROUND OR A LOOK ON THE TV NAY C. SMASH AND GRABS- THAT IS THAT IT AND IT'S REAL. LET'S LET'S FACE IT THAT IS A REAL REAL FEAR AND I THINK THAT'S THE DAILY TIMES POLL SHOWS THAT. PEOPLE REALLY DO FEEL IT. AT THE- AGREEMENTS LACKEY THE GOVERNOR WE NEED TO BE THANKING THE GOVERNOR'S I THINK HE HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS DATA CALIFORNIA AND ALL OF US NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND THIS IS AFTER. TO GET THE LEGISLATURE INVOLVED TO GET THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE INVOLVED AND- COMMITTEE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE- ACTIVIST GROUPS INVOLVED TO GO AT THIS ORGANIZED RETAIL. THEFT OF BRAIN. ALL THE- AND I'M GONNA REMEMBER WHAT MISS HOWARD TOLD US AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A BORDER STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE TO GIVE THEM SOME KIND OF GUARD RAILS AND DIRECTION. IF FEDERAL CRIMINAL MISCHIEF IT IS MR LACKEY REMEMBERS ANY OTHER BOARD MEMBERS REMEMBER- WE HAD ASKED B. S. YOU SEE ABOUT ANOTHER PROGRAM THEY WERE GIVING OUT GRANTS FOR. AN KENNEDY ANSWER CAME BACK THE LEGISLATURE. TOLD HIM JUST TO DO THE REPORT TO PUT HIM UP ON A SHELF. WHICH IS WHAT THEY DID. WHICH IS WHAT WE TELL THEM TO DO WE DID NOT ASK FOR THE ACCOUNTABILITY METRONET AFTER TO SYNTHESIZE IT AND COME BACK WITH DATA TO THIS GROUP. ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THAT PARTICULAR GRANT PROGRAM WAS AND SO SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IF WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS RIGHT WE HAVE TO JOIN WITH THE GOVERNOR TO PUT DOWN WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. A LOT OF THIS HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TOWARD ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. NOT ONLY IS THE GOALS BUT JUST CLEAR RESOURCES OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WHAT IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES ON DOWN- AND OF COURSE IMPLEMENTATION. IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION OF. THE REASON WHY I BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR HAD HERE TO CITIES WITHWITH CHP BECAUSE CHP IS TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS. THESE GRANTS ARE SUPPOSED TO GO TO A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO KIND OF DO THE SAME THING IN CONJUNCTION WITH C. H. P. OR DO IT ON THEIR OWN WE HAVE AN TO FIND AT THE SO WE'RE PUTTING THAT ON B. SEC. THE CANADA FIND IT WE PROBABLY NEED TO HELP THEM TO FIND IT TOO BECAUSE NOT EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY BELIEVES IN ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- THEY BELIEVE FELONIES LOCKING UP PEOPLE. THROWING AWAY THE KEY AND THAT'S IT NASTA THAT'S HOW YOU SOLVE IT I THINK IS A MULTI. APPROACH AND THAT'S WHAT THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT BUILDERS. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO DO BUT- AT THE END OF THE DAY- WE DO HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE. MEAT TO IT AND- AND HOPEFULLY MISS HOWARD CAN COMMENT ON WHAT ELSE SHE NEEDS SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU SO THAT AFTER YEAR IT GOES BY IF WE ASK FOR ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WHAT WHAT IS BEEN DONE. SO THAT. MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE'RE NOT HAVING THIS DEBATE FOR EXAMPLE ON. IS ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CRIMES GOING UP GOING DOWN THE IN BETWEEN A LEVELED OUT THAT WE- THAT MAYBE THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE REQUIRE- LAW ENFORCEMENT IT GET THESE GRANTS THAT THEY ASK IS HOW THEY TELL US HOW EFFECTIVE IT'S BEEN. BUT MORE IMPORTANT WHAT DID THEY USE TO GET IT DONE HOPEFULLY COMPORTS WITH THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT BILL. AND IN AND COME UP WITH MAYBE SOME INGENIOUS WAYS TO GET THIS DONE. LIKE TECHNOLOGY. I WANT TO GET AWAY WITH SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD ON TECHNOLOGY IN ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT BUT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS ARE. KIND OF. IN THE FUTURE SPACE AGE PROBABLY WAY ABOVE MY TECHNOLOGY LEVEL THAT THEY CAN USE TO GO BACK AND TRACED BACK TO STOLEN MATERIAL BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO WHO'VE TAKEN IT THAT COULD BE PART OF THE GRANT. THE DALLAS MAY BE PART OF GIVING MORE MONEY TO RETAILERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TECHNOLOGY- WORKING WITH RETAILERS DO DUE TO TECHNOLOGY SO THAT THEY CAN DO THAT. LET'S BE SMART. ABOUT THE GRANT PROGRAM. AND MAKE IT MORE ROBUST AND- ULTIMATELY MAKE SURE THEY'RE SOMEBODY IN CHARGE. AND THAT THAT WHOEVER'S IN CHARGE OF CHP OR WHETHER IT'S A OTHERS USED TO WORK MORE FOR THINKING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY I WANT TO USE ALL THESE TECHNIQUES AND WANTED TO EVERYTHING THAT THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT BILL DOES. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO COBBLE TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT IS OUT OF THE BOX MICHAEL TO WITH THEIR NORMALLY DO BUT THEY DO SOMETHING THAT- INVENTIVE IN NEW AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS MONEY IS REALLY. REALLY FOR AND SO I WILL ASK MISS HOWARD AND SHE CAN SHE CAN COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT- WHAT KIND OF GUARDRAILS WE SHOULD PUT ON HERE ARE NO GUARD RAILS OR WHAT WE NEED TO DO. TO MAKE. FOR ME THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IS THE GRANT PROGRAM. TO THE GRANT PROGRAM ULTIMATELY STARTS BY N. FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. ONCE YOU START TO GET BUY IN FROM BOTH. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY ARE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT I THINK WE'LL GET WE'LL GET A LONG WAY TOWARD REDUCING. OR AT LEAST IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS AND THEN REDUCING THAT AND SO THAT- EVERYONE FEELS SAFE. BECAUSE AGAIN OUR OUR REPEAT THIS AGAIN THE FEAR. IS ABSOLUTELY- RIO AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME BEST PRACTICES. ON HOW WE DEAL WITH ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD- THE VERTICAL PROSECUTION. AND ALSO HOPEFULLY THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT. ACROSS COUNTY LINES WHEN PEOPLE STEAL SOMETHING I BELIEVE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DOJ. BEING ABLE TO HANDLE THAT WELL LET'S MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND RESOURCES IF SOMEBODY STILL SOMETHING VENTURA COUNTY. AND IN L. A. COUNTY SOMEBODY'S IN CHARGE TO BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE ACROSS THOSE COUNTY LINE. BECAUSE THAT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AS IS ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE CAN AGGREGATED UP SO THAT IF THE PERSON NEEDS TO BE CHARGED WITH A FELONY DAY OUR INTERNET SKIRTING AROUND LAW. FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY TO COUNTY AND I BELIEVE SOME OF THIS IS IN HERE- TO IT TO ADDRESS THAT- WITH THE JORDAN DOJ ORGANIZED RETAIL ENTERPRISE PROGRAM. AND THE DOJ TASK FORCE- SO. THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A LOT. I MEAN A LOT IN HERE. THAT IT MAY ONLY BE THE START. BUT I THINK IT'S A NOT A GOOD START I THINK IS A GREAT START FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE COLLEAGUES FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE THIS IS A GOOD GOOD START. THAT WE'RE TRYING RIGHT HERE. SO IF YOU AN ANSWER ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED BE SEC. SO THE WEEKEND IS DONE RIGHT. THE FIRST TIME. M. WE'RE NOT YELLING AT YOU IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET IT RIGHT IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER OF THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD YOUR NAME FROM THAT COMMITTEE SEEM TO FALL INTO. THREE GENERAL TOPICS- PRIORITIES NEEDS PRIORITIES FOR THE FUNDING HOW THERE'S A GLITCH DEMONSTRATION AND NEED IN THE GRANT PROPOSALS AND THE DESIRED REPORTING ON OUTCOMES- SO I'M NOT READY TO ANSWER ANY DETAILS THAT ARE OFFERING A DETAILED PROPOSAL IN THOSE THREE AREAS BUT MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE STAFF ON. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THAT MIGHT INCLUDE AND LIKE I SAID IN OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS THEIR PET. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA PROTEST HE CAN IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF DIRECTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE GETS THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT. AND I BEEN OUT A GET OFF MY SOAPBOX NOW LAST YEAR I WOULD. RECOMMEND THAT YOU IT WITH THIS COMMITTEE YOU CAN TALK TO BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE I THINK WE HAVE. MEMBERS HERE THAT COULD GIVE YOU SOME VALUABLE INFORMATION ON HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH THIS. THANKS. PANEL TWO VERTICAL PROSECUTION OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT AGAIN THAT'S A K. IS THAT CORRECT TO BE A CC THEN MISSILE NEO AND AN APARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER THIS- HOPE PROPOSAL HAS TO DO WITH- PROVIDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY- THROUGH TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FOUR- THE GRANT PROGRAM FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS I TO CREATE DEDICATED RETAIL THEFT PROSECUTION TEAMS I'M SURE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH VERTICAL PROSECUTION AND THE BENEFITS OF HAVING BURKE PROSECUTION TEAMS. AS MR JONES SAWYER HAS PROVIDED A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES MR LACKEY AS WELL- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT AND- THERE CAN BE. DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS YOU KNOW MANY DIFFERENT CITIES AND COUNTIES INVOLVED LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN COORDINATED EFFORTS TO- CONNECT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CRIMES IN A VERTICAL PROSECUTION STRUCTURE IS REALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY THEN YOU HAVE DEDICATED ATTORNEYS THAT CAN BE. FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE CASES THE CROSS JURISDICTIONAL TASK FORCES AND THE- ELEMENTS THAT ARE THRIVING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT SO WE THINK THAT- THE VIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT- ARTICLE PROSECUTION ON THESE KINDS OF CRIMES IS A SOUND INVESTMENT- DO YOU GET BETTER RESULTS SO- YOU WANT TO ENSURE. THAT THE RAY ARE THERE TO- TO GO AFTER- AND HOLD RESPONSIBLE- THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THESE SORTS OF ACTIVITIES AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS OF COURSE. GEN MASANYA. THE COMMENTS THAT I GAVE ON PANEL ONE APPLY TO THIS ITEM AS WELL. DEFIED IN A MIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAN SORRY JUST TECH I GUESS REITERATE WHAT YOU HAD MENTIONED EARLIER AS FAR AS THAT. YOU KNOW COMPLEXITY THESE TYPES OF CASES THAT AS MISS HOWARD SAID WE REALLY WANT TO FIND TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW PROSECUTION HAPPENS THE INNING IN ADDITION WITH ENFORCEMENT AND IT THERE'S A LOT OF KIND OF COORDINATION THAT GOES ON BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT PROSECUTOR OFFICES. AND THE RETAILERS WHO ARE IMPACTED- AND WE JUST REALLY THINK THAT FUNDING IS NECESSARY TO KIND OF COMPLETE THE WHOLE PICTURE. JANKY THERE WILL BRING A BATCH COMMITTEE VIBE MY ONLY QUESTION IS JUST. JUST FROM AN IMPLEMENTATION STANDPOINT ARE YOU ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS MONEY TO GO IN. AND GET IN A COORDINATOR TO COORDINATE WITH THE DA LAW LAW ENFORCEMENT JUDICIAL SO THAT THEY IN IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS- ARE IS IT. HOW DO YOU CAN I MEAN YOU NEED TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PAY FOR WHAT THAT MIGHT BE THE BEST WAY TO SAY IT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GETTING SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS FROM- DAILYO AND OTHERS WHO HOW HOW IS. HOW IS THIS IMPLEMENTED I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING. IT IS ANYBODY NOW- WE HADN'T FIGURED OUT YET. THE THIS IS KATIE HOWARD WITH THE BSE THEME MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS FUNDING IS TO GO TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES TO SUPPORT VERTICAL PROSECUTION TEAM- AND- IN TERMS OF WHETHER THERE WOULD BE WITHIN THE TEN MILLION IF SOME OF THAT FUNDING WOULD GO TO OTHER ENTITIES ARE JURISDICTIONS- I DON'T THINK WE'VE GOTTEN INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IN THE CONVERSATION AS YET BUT THE PROPOSAL IS TO FIND- THE PARTICLE PROSECUTION WORK WITHIN DA'S OFFICES. SO SELECCI THERE ANY GUESSTIMATE ON- THE NUMBER OF PROSECUTIONS. THIS WILL FUND OR WHAT YOU'RE PREPARED TO PROSECUTE. WHEN THE NUMBER OF CASES. MISTER LUCKY I DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL AT THIS MOMENT. OKAY SO YOU YOU I KNOW DISCOVERED RECALL BACK AND FORTH BUT DO SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE. IF THERE'S A BACKLOG THAT THEY COULD I JUST CASES THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO AND IS IT IS THERE A BACKLOG. AGAINST PART OF WHAT MR MAY REFLECT HE'S GETTING TO BALANCE THE NUMBER OF CASES BUT- THAT THIS WILL GO TO BUT ALSO. ARE NOT ABLE TO GET TO IT MAY NEED IS ADDITIONAL MONEY TO BE ABLE TO. DO TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG OR GET TO THESE CASES. AND IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO COVER TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND SO. I'M JUST WONDERING. ARE THEY HAD THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME KIND OF AN APPROXIMATION- SO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE. THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO- CARRY OUT THOSE PROSECUTIONS ESPECIALLY THROUGH VERTICAL PROCESS. THE MOST RETARDED. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPOSAL IS THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH TO ADDRESS A BACKLOG OF MR JONES SAWYER BUT RATHER THAT IT'S TO BUILD THE CAPACITY WITHIN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES TO FORM VERTICAL PROSECUTION TEAM SO TO FIND- THE ATTORNEYS AND OTHER STAFF WOULD BE WORKING ON PROSECUTING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT IN A WAY THAT IS SEEN TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGES FOR THIS KIND OF- CRYING SO. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND YES IT'S OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD IN TERMS OF THE- THE FUNDING PROPOSAL MISTER LUCKY AND I THINK THE NOTION IS WILL HAVE SOME INFORMATION OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN HOW SUCCESSFUL IT'S BEEN IF THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS A PRETTY GOOD ESTIMATE AS TO STATEWIDE NEED YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN PROPOSALS NEW GRANT PROPOSALS COME OUT- YOU KNOW SEE THERE'S A- GRANT PROGRAM FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WE MAY RECEIVE. THREE OR FOUR TIMES THAT NUMBER- YOU KNOW DOLLARS IN TERMS OF THAT REQUESTED GRANT APPLICATIONS SO UNTIL WE LAUNCH IT WE CAN'T REALLY BE SURE MY SENSE IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT LIKE TEN MILLION WAS A REASONABLE PLACE TO START THERE'S NO GUESSWORK INVOLVED TO BE SURE OF ONE FINAL QUESTION FRACTURE BLACKIE HAVE WE START ANY INPUT AT ALL FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WITHIN THE STATE. GET THEIR. THEIR INPUT ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. I AM NOT SURE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HAVE BEEN FORMALLY DONE THAT AT THIS POINT. DEAL WITH MAY HAVE MORE INFORMATION HI JUSTIN EDELMAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ACTIVELY YOU KNOW COLLABORATING WITH THE- SPECIFIC DISTRICT ATTORNEYS FOR THIS PROPOSAL IT'S LARGELY. DRIVEN OFF OF CHP'S INFORMATION ON THEIR KIND OF ARRESTS AND WHAT THEIR YOU KNOW. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE RESULTED IN BUT AGAIN THE INTENTION WAS TO SIT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND KIND OF BUILDING UP A COMPLEX. WORK OF. WHO ARE MORE MORE SPECIFIC WE FOCUSED ON ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PROSECUTIONS CAN OCCUR LOCALLY. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE IT WOULD BE A LOGICAL SUGGESTION TO INCLUDE THEM IN SOME. PART OF THIS PROCESS. BUT THIS COULD BE A WAY TO KICKSTART. APRIL PROGRAM IN DIFFERENT DAYS OFFICE- I THE CONCERN IT PROBABLY IS JUST SO IF YOU'RE LISTENING IS. I THINK IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY IN THERE TO ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS IS MONEY THAT IT COULD BE HANDLED INTERNALLY WITH EXISTING RESOURCES AND MONEY AND THEY ONLY NEED FIVE MILLION WHICH MEANS AND THE REST WILL GO BACK TO GENERAL FUND BUT IT WAS. THE QUESTION WAS MORE IF YOU NEED TO TWENTY. I DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE. UPSET IT GIVING YOU MORE MONEY IF WE KNEW THIS WOULD HELP. IN REDUCING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT THAT'S- IF YOU GET A SENSE OF WHERE THESE QUESTIONS ARE COMING FROM. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. OKAY WITH THAT WOULD GO TO A PANEL THREE. CONTRA DRUG TASK FORCE PROGRAM EXPANSION- I HAVE A MAJOR GENERAL MATTHEW BEAVERS CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT THEN I NEED TO LEAVE FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE'VE GOT YOU FOR EIGHT TO SAID JAY IT IS A BIT THE GENERAL MATT BEAVERS AND THE DEPUTY ADJUTANT GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT SUPPOSED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. SO THIS BUDGET ITEM THAT PROVIDES FOR A ONE TIME A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION- TO OUR EXISTING COUNTER NARCOTICS TASK FORCE OUR EXISTING PROGRAM IS FRANKLY WHILE THE OVERSUBSCRIBED HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND- THIS DEPARTMENT TO FURTHER AUGMENT. OUR A SUPPORT TO THE STATES FOR I INTENSELY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS AS WELL AS TO OUR FEDERAL STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT IN THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE SEIZURES OF HEROIN THREATEN ALL THE COCAINE THAT WE SUPPORTED- INCREASED BY FIVE HUNDRED AND 77% FOR HEROIN TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT. FOR FENNEL AND 68% FOR COCAINE FURTHER THIS DOCUMENTATION WILL INCREASE CAN INCREASE OUR SUPPORT TO THE RATIFICATION OF CARTEL FUNDED INDUSTRIAL SCALE ILLEGAL MARIJUANA CULTIVATION IT'S ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING OUR COLLEGE OF OUR STATE NEGLEY IMPACTS OUR STATE SO LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. AND WITH THAT'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. ANY DAILY WITH THE LATEST AND OFFICE- MY COLLEAGUE NATHANAEL GAVE OUR COMMENTS ON THE BROADER AGAIN. BUT FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THIS PROPOSAL FOR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REFERENCED WAS- THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PLAN LACKED CLEAR OBJECTIVES FOR ACHIEVING. THE INTENDED PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS AND ALONG THOSE LINES WE FOUND THAT CERTAIN PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE INCLUDING THIS ONE. MIGHT NOT BE STRUCTURED TO ACHIEVE THE INTENDED OUTCOMES. AND SO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO REDUCE OPIOID OVERDOSES AS WELL AS CRIMES AND VIOLENCE RELATED TO THE SMUGGLING AND DISTRIBUTION OF ILLEGAL DRUGS. HOWEVER ON THE FLIP SIDE- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE TEND TO INVOLVE TARGETING ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION AND TRAFFICKING. WHICH IS A SEPARATE AND REASONABLE ST MICHAEL BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ONE THAT AND THE SAME. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE'S PRIORITY IS REDUCING OVERALL OVERDOSE DEATHS LINKED TO ILLEGAL DRUGS THIS PROPOSAL AS IT'S CURRENTLY STRUCTURED MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST WAY OF ACHIEVING THAT. SO WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HM WEBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME BUT WILL BE ON STANDBY FOR ANY QUESTIONS LIKE I HELP WITH. OKAY. SO IT WAS A JUST A CLARIFICATION SORRY IT. THIS IS FOR DAILYO SO ARE ARE YOU SAYING THEY ARE PUTTING TOO MUCH IN ONE BASKET OR THAT MAYBE SHOULD FOCUS IN ON WHICH IS A BIG PROBLEM GROWS IN THE STATE WHERE THE- THE MILITARY MAY HAVE TO BAND WITH- TO. DO A QUICK MINUTE OR WHATEVER IT IS TO BE ABLE TO CAMPUS AN AREA LARGE GALLON. GO AFTER GROWS AS OPPOSED TO. MAYBE COMING INTO NEIGHBORHOODS AND DEALING WITH IT AND ALL I MEAN I'M NOT IT IS AN IMPLEMENTATION. CHALLENGE IT IT TIES BACK TO ON THE BUSINESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOUR COMMENT ABOUT OUTCOMES FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT AND SO WHAT ARE THE INTENDED OUTCOMES AND SO IN REVIEWING OUR REVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE. THE GOAL SEEMS TO BE REDUCING OPIOID DEATHS LINKED TO ILLEGAL DRUGS. ON THE FLIP SIDE THAN WHAT WE'RE BALANCING OFF IS- AS REFERENCE THE PROGRAM IS OVER SUBSCRIBED SUBSCRIBED AND THERE ARE LOTS OF REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE. THE REQUEST THOUGH- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THE VAST MAJORITY RELATES TO ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION AND TRAFFICKING AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE SAYING THAT- THE LEGISLATURE IN THINKING ABOUT ITS PRIORITY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY IS ALIGNED WITH THE GOAL THE SPECIFIC GOAL AN OUTCOME THAT'S DESIRED AND SO IF THE GOAL. IS TO REDUCE. OPIOID DEATHS OR REDUCE DRUG THAT'S TIED TO ILLEGAL DRUGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO RESTRUCTURE THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT. OKAY SO IF WE WANTED TO RESTRUCTURE IT TO JUST DEAL WITH. ILLEGAL GROWS. AND SO A WHOLE TWENTY MILLION. WITH THAT MAKE. SOME KIND OF SENSE SO THEY HAD A PROGRAM THAT COULD WELL DELINEATED WHAT EACH STEP THAT WOULD BE SO WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TARGETING ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION TRAFFICKING IS A REASONABLE GOAL IS JUST A DIFFERENT STATEWIDE GOAL AND SO WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ALL OF YOUR DIFFERENT PRIORITIES PUBLIC SAFETY AND EVEN WITHIN PUBLIC SAFETY IF IT'S CRIMES SUCH AS AUTO THEFTS- HOMICIDES OR FIRE ARMS LIKE THIS COMMITTEE AS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY- THIS COULD. ADDRESSING CANNABIS COULD BE ANOTHER PRIORITIES SO IT'S REALLY JUST A LIST OF THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THINKING ABOUT IT IS A LIST OF LIKE WHAT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IN TERMS OF USING THE MONEY TO ACHIEVE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. JERRY. THAT WHAT IS IT YEAH I GET THAT ITCH WHICH COMES FUND PURSE CHICKEN I ATE BUT I THINK WE CN A WE JUST PROBABLY NEED A LITTLE MORE FLESHING OUT- BECAUSE I THINK WE DON'T KNOW HOW ON THE FENTANYL OR THE DRUG USE- I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SITTING TANKS IN SOUTH LA TO GO DEAL WITH FEDERAL. SO HOW DOES THE MILITARY. FIT IN THAT PART AYE RIGHT- I THINK WE ALL WANNA PERCENT CONCEDE A MILITARY FLYING OVER. GROWS OR ARE GOING AFTER THAT- I THINK WE CAN. FEEL THAT BUT IT IT MAY JUST MEAN- I WAS THE MAJOR GENERAL COMING BACK AND EXPLAINING TO US HOW THE OTHERS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW THIS MONEY WOULD BE USED- SO WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AND- WE OPTED TO GO THROUGH THAT RIGHT NOW. AS THE HOURS. GETTING PRETTY LATE. SO I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO THE PANEL NUMBER FOUR- DOJ ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME ENTERPRISE- O. R. C. E. PROGRAM IN DOJ TASK FORCE PROGRAM. BOB ASHLEY HART FROM DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE NEED TO LEAD THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND GET DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU ASHLEE HEART BUDGET OFFICE DIRK WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- THERE TO DO JEFF PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THIS PARTICULAR PANEL OF THE AGENDA ITEM AT THE GOVERNOR'S PURPOSE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES IN THE FIRST PROPOSAL. AS PART OF A MULTI AGENCY PROPOSAL SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR THREE YEARS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONGOING FOR THE DOJ TO SUPPORT REGIONAL TASK FORCES COMBATING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT AND PROSECUTE RETAIL THEFT CASES THAT SPAN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. THIS REQUEST WILL ALLOW DOJ'S DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EXPAND ITS WHITE COLOR INVESTIGATIVE TEAM PROGRAM WHICH WILL TARGET COMPLEX ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES. AND WILL FOCUS ON COMPLICATED CASES THAT SPAN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. BUT DELETE A DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL THEN REFER RETAIL CRIME INVESTIGATIONS TO THE DOJ'S CRIMINAL LAW DIVISION FOR PROSECUTION. COULD YOU CHECK THAT IN THE PROPOSAL WILL SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT FIFTEEN ENFORCEMENT POSITIONS IN THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. A TOTALING THREE POINT FIVE MILLION AND THIRTEEN LEGAL POSITIONS IN OUR CRIMINAL LAW DIVISION TOTALING TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. ADULT THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS WILL IMPLEMENT TO INVESTIGATIVE TEAMS ARE IN THE NORTH AND IN THE SOUTH REGION. AND WILL LIVE WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CHP LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M JOINED TODAY BY STEPHEN WOOLERY OUR CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND WERE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON DOJ'S PORTION OF THIS PROPOSAL- ON THIS. THERE TO APPROVAL THE FEAR OF THE FIRST WILL TAKE BE ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME ENTERPRISE PROGRAM. AGAIN COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUE APPLY SO WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON ON BASICALLY A POTENTIAL OPTION FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION HERE- SO AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA BEFORE YOU ON THE TABLE THERE'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER PROPOSAL THAT'S GOING TO BE HEARD IN ANOTHER SUBCOMMITTEE. THAT WOULD EXPAND THE CHP ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME TASK FORCES MADE MAKING THE THREE EXISTING ONES PERMANENT AND THEN ADDING TWO ADDITIONAL ONES. AND SO IN THINKING OF THAT TO THE EXTENT THE STATE IS INTERESTED IN TARGETING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT THAT IS SPECIFICALLY COORDINATED BY CRIMINAL GANGS AND NETWORKS. DOJ MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A BETTER AND TO T. TWO EVENTS EACH P. TO ADMINISTER THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERTISE IN MANAGING DEDICATED TASK FORCES AS WELL AS MANAGING THOSE THAT CONSIST OF FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS. DOJ ALSO EMPLOYS BOTH- INVESTIGATOR PERSONAL AS WELL AS ATTORNEYS WHICH COULD HELP WITH THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF THOSE CASES SUCCESSFULLY- WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT ON THE CHP FRONTS- THERE COULD BE SOME STAFFING ISSUES THAT COULD IMPACT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TWO NEW ONES BECAUSE OF THE HIGH VACANCY RATE AND SO IN THE SHORT RUN OUR UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT WOULD BE GOING TO OVERTIME. RATHER THAN DEDICATED OFFICERS WHICH COULD IMPACT THE OUTCOMES. THE TURNING- ARE. TO THE DOJ TASK FORCE PROGRAM. THAT IS ONE WHERE WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER APPROVING THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT WOULD MAINTAIN DOJ'S PARTICIPATION IN EIGHT EXISTING TASK FORCES. AND THESE TYPES OF TASK FORCES CAN BE A REALLY COST EFFECTIVE WAY. OF ADDRESSING COMPLEX OR MULTI JURISDICTIONAL CRIMES THAT HAVE BOTH STATE AND REGIONAL IMPACT. AND SO- A BIG PART OF THIS IS- YOU KNOW EACH OF THE PARTICIPATING AGENCIES FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL GENERALLY COVER THEIR OWN COSTS- WHICH THEN PROVIDES INCENTIVE THAT THE CRIMES THAT ARE SELECTED WITHIN EACH REGION. ARE THOSE THAT ARE PRIORITIZED BY EACH OF THE PARTICIPATING MEMBERS GENERALLY THE MOST PRESSING THE MOST COMPLEX FEDERA. SO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER O'NEILL MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN CRIMES THAT POTENTIALLY COULD DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. SO ONE OF THE OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IF ADDRESSING THIS AND THAT COULD BE AS A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS TO CONSIDER EXPANDING. THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE IT OPERATES REGIONALLY. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD HAVE INCENTIVE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THE COSTS WOULD BE SHARED. BUT THE CASES THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED ARE- YOU KNOW WATER IMPACTING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THE STATE WOULD ALSO BENEFIT BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE PAYING FOR THE FULL COST OF INVESTIGATING THESE TYPES OF CASES AND SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER OPTION FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THISIS KEVIN CLARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OVER MORE THAN HAPPY TO. ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT EITHER THE BULLS. SO THE. THE SHARES BACK. THEN AND THEN I'LL START WITH. NOT REALLY A GOOD QUESTION BT WHAT A COMMENT- IT MIGHT EVEN BE A QUESTION OF. WHEN I HAD MY HEARING AND IT WOULD INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO- MAKE SOME CHANGES TO ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE IN A PRESS. WERE WE WAITING FOR BATMAN WELL DOJ'S MY BATMAN. BATMAN IS HERE IN THIS IN IN PALATABLE FOR DOJ ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CRIME ENTERPRISES THAT'S THE PERSON I WILL LOOK AT EVERYTHING ACROSS JURISDICTION AND IN FACT- IF WE COULD PUT A ZERO BEHIND THE SIX IN A ZERO BEHIND A FIVE GOING TO SCARE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GUY. BUT THAT'S HOW MUCH FAITH I HAVEN'T- THAT WE GO ALL OUT- TO PROVIDE NADIA JURISDICTIONAL- THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO BUT AGAIN- WORKING WITH CHP- TO EXPAND THIS ACROSS THE STATE ON TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE. AND YOU DECIDE WHO'S BATMAN WHO'S RODMOND. C. H. OR OR BUDGET OR RETURN THE GENERAL BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY NOW YOU HAVE. A STATE WIDE ENTITY. THAT'S HANDLING THIS FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND YOU PUT PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THIS THAT'S BEEN PART OF THE PROBLEM AND THEN YOU DO A COMPREHENSIVE. PROGRAM THAT STATEWIDE THAT EVERYBODY WILL COME COMPORTMENT CONFORM TO. AND SO- THAT. WHILE THE- THE NOTES I HAD SAID THAT THE CHAIR HAD NO COMMENT I JUST ONCE I AM A- ALSO IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH IT PROBABLY MORE SO. THEN WHAT L. A- WANTED TO DO OR YOUR PARTNER FINANCE WANTED TO DO THAT'S HOW MUCH FAITH I HAVEN'T. THE WILL GIVE IT BACK TO CHAIRS NOW BACK LEADING THE CHARGE FOR US IN THE QUESTIONS- I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS- I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ENSURE WE GET MORE DETAILS.

GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER SIGN AND WANT TO CHECK THEM POLITICAL DIRECTOR CRITICAL RESISTANCE ALSO A MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA HAS SOME RESPONSIBLE BUDGET IN SAN JOSE I DON'T THINK THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION TO SEE SHOWERS WASTEFUL SPENDING PARTICULARLY FOR THE COMMENTS RICHARD GARCIA NUMBERS TENGAN JONES SAWYER STATING OBVIOUS IT'S A CRUCIAL. CRUCIATUS CAREER ON THE NUMBERS AND LACKLUSTER RESPONSES FROM CVC ARE IS THAT IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE COMMITTEE TO CATEGORICALLY REJECT GDPR'S REQUEST FOR MORE FUNDING INTO TRAFFIC HE ARTICLES MORE PRISONS YEAR AFTER YEAR CDCR SHIRK RESPONSIBILITY THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO THIS UNLESS THIS COMMITTEE TAKES ACTION TO BRING THEM IN.

WHAT WE NEED IS TO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS THAT E'VE HELD AND- BODIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING THESE TYPES OF BUDGET DECISIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T PASS THE STATE BUDGET BY JUNE FIFTEENTH. BY LAW LEGISLATORS DON'T GET PAID WHAT IF INNOCENT INSTANCE THE DVR DOESN'T GET PAID NOT JUST IN TERMS OF SALARY BUT IN TERMS OF ALLOCATION AFTER ALLOCATION AFTER APPLICATION WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THIS COMMITTEE AND MAKING BOLD MOVES AND HAVING STRONG CONSEQUENCES HERE. THAT THAT MAKES US A CONTINUE TO HOLD THE SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE HAVING A REDUCED PRISON POPULATION IS A CHOICE. IT IS NOT THAT THE SHIFT AND THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN OUR PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION AND LET'S TO DO THAT NOW AND FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS.
