00:55:54.384 --> 00:55:57.420
TWENTY NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS

00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:59.689
. ATION TO FOUR POINT FIVE

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:01.424
MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND AND

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:03.660
CRITICAL HABITAT FOR MANY NATIVE

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:06.296
SPECIES. THE STATE WATER BOARD

00:56:06.362 --> 00:56:08.732
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING

00:56:08.798 --> 00:56:10.467
THE WATER IN THE BAY DELTA. BY

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.569
DROPPING AND IMPLEMENTING WATER

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:14.337
QUALITY OBJECTIVES AS PART OF

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:16.406
THE BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:21.945
CONTROL PLAN OR FAIL TO PLAN.

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:24.914
THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED IN

00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:26.750
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE NEARLY

00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:28.451
TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. SINCE

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:29.953
THEN THE IMPACT OF DROUGHT AND

00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:32.889
CLIMATE. HAVE BEGUN TO WRECK

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:35.225
HAVOC ON THE DELTA. COUPLED WITH

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:37.360
OTHER FACTORS THIS IS DRIVEN

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:39.062
SOME NATIVE FISH TO THE BRINK OF

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:41.531
EXTINCTION EXTINCTION AND

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:43.800
PROBABLY TO EXTINCTION. WHEN THE

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:45.301
WATER BOARD STARTED THE MOST

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:47.303
RECENT UPDATES TO THE BAY DELTA

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.472
PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. YOU

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:51.007
COULD STILL FIND DELTA SMELT IN

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:53.510
THE DELTA. NOW THEY HAVE NOT

00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:55.245
BEEN SEEN IN THE WILD FOR THE

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:57.781
PAST FOUR YEARS. REPORTS BY

00:56:57.847 --> 00:56:59.749
WATER LAW EXPERTS AND THE

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:01.518
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE FOUND

00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:03.553
THAT UPDATES THE BAY DELTA

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.189
PLANNER URGENTLY NEEDED TO

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.690
PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S DRINKING

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.159
WATER. NATIVE FISH AND THE

00:57:09.225 --> 00:57:10.927
WATERSHED ITSELF FROM WORSENING

00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:13.863
THREATS IMPOSED BY CLIMATE

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.332
CHANGE AND DROUGHT. THE LACK OF

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:18.067
MODERN WATER QUALITY STANDARDS

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:20.336
ALSO HURTS LONG TERM PLANNING

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:22.005
FOR WATER PROJECTS BY CREATING

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:27.243
UNCERTAINTY THAT IS IN NINETEEN

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:28.311
NINETY SIX NINETEEN NINETY FIVE.

00:57:28.378 --> 00:57:30.580
YOU COULD HAVE SAID- YOU CAN

00:57:30.647 --> 00:57:34.217
IMPROVE MY PLOT I REQUEST FOR

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:35.685
WATER FROM THE DELTA BECAUSE

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:38.221
THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED PLAN

00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:39.923
THERE REALLY IS THE ESTABLISH

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:42.692
PLAN NOW IS JUST TOO LONG AGO.

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:44.794
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY QUOTED SO

00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:46.496
IT IS ACTUALLY HARDER RIGHT NOW

00:57:46.563 --> 00:57:49.199
TO GET WATER RIGHTS AND IT WOULD

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:51.334
BE IF THE PLAN WERE UPDATED.

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:52.635
THIS PLAN A CO DEFIES THE

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:54.370
CURRENT GOAL OF THE STATE WATER

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:56.206
BOARD TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT AN

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.875
UPDATE TO THE BAY DOWN TO PLANT.

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:00.109
BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:04.781
THREE. FOR A START. AND IT'S TO

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:07.016
ADOPT ENABLE UP TO THE BAY DELTA

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:10.820
PLAN. AS AN INCENTIVE. THE BILL

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.922
IN PRINT PAUSES EXTENDING HER A

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.490
SHE KNEW WATER RIGHTS THAT WOULD

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:16.159
DIVERT ADDITIONAL FLOW AWAY FROM

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:17.994
THE DELTA. TO THESE WATER RIGHTS

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:21.598
PERMITS CAN BE ASSESSED USING

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:22.532
CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS. MOVING

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:24.634
FORWARD I CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:25.768
THE STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:31.507
APOLLO. FROM THE OPPOSITION-

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:33.743
UNLESS AMENDED COALITION TO

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.511
AVOID UNINTENDED IMPACTS TO

00:58:35.578 --> 00:58:38.181
PROJECTS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:39.182
DROUGHT MANAGEMENT. IN THE

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:40.383
FUTURE I TEND TO MAKE TWO

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:41.684
ADDITIONAL CHANGES WHICH STARTED

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:43.953
DRESSED CONCERNS RAISED BY THE

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.256
OPPOSITION THESE CHANGES WILL

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:48.091
CLARIFY THAT THE MORATORIUM ON

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:49.859
WATER RIGHTS WILL ONLY GO INTO

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:52.128
EFFECT IF THE WATER BOARD MRS

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:55.632
THE DEADLINE. TO ADOPT THE BAY

00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:56.366
DELTA PLAN WHICH WAS THE

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:58.201
ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BILL BUT

00:58:58.268 --> 00:58:59.035
WILL CLARIFY THAT THAT'S THE

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:01.170
CASE FURTHER OUR MOVE THE

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:03.206
MORATORIUM ON EXTENDING CERTAIN

00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:05.041
WATER RIGHTS TO REDUCE IMPACTS

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:07.243
TO WATER TRANSFERS AN EXISTING

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:10.680
PROJECTS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:11.714
DROUGHT MANAGEMENT. THE POINT IS

00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:13.583
THOUGH THAT WE NEED SOME SORT OF

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:15.919
INCENTIVE. FOR THE BOARD TO

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:17.654
CONTINUE THEY'VE ALREADY MISSED

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.690
MANY DEADLINES BECAUSE THE PLAN

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:22.225
SHOULD HAVE BEEN UPDATED AND IT

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:24.794
HASN'T AND WE HAVE FELT THE

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:27.430
IMPACT. WITH ME TODAY IS JONAS

THAT I WAS ACTUALLY WATER

WHAT'S THE BIG HURRY. THERE ARE

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:31.541
TWO REASONS. FIRST THE ICONIC

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:43.119
NOT LIKE THE MOVIE JURASSIC PARK

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.754

01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:05.901
PEOPLE IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:08.637
AREA. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IN

THE RELIABLE DELIVERY- OF HIGH

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:14.476
QUALITY AFFORDABLE WATER IS

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.178
ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:18.080
I THINK YOU KNOW IS BEHIND THE

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:19.982
REASON WHY MR CORK IS BRINGING

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.751
THE BILL FORWARD. FOR A LARGE

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:24.520
PART ONE LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:30.793
REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF OVERALL

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.294
WATER SUPPLY WHAT REALLY CLIMATE

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:34.229
CHANGES IS WREAKING IN THE

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:36.265
NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS A

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:37.700
CHANGE IN OUR PRECIPITATION

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.535
PATTERNS. SO WE'RE MOVING AWAY

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:41.136
FROM PRECIPITATION PATTERNS THAT

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:43.606
WERE BASED ON SNOW PACKED THAT

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.841
CHANGES THE WAY THAT OUR SYSTEM

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:49.345
FUNCTIONS AND THAT THEN CASCADES

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.280
INTO RAMIFICATIONS ON WATER

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:52.615
RIGHTS AND HOW WATER RIGHTS PLAY

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.550
OUT AND THAT'S REALLY THE BIG.

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:56.151
CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THE

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:59.588
BILL. IN OUR REGION OUR PRIMARY

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:03.192
WAY OF ADAPTING CALL CAME. SHIP

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:07.396
NOPE. REGIME DOWN TO EIGHT WATER

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:09.331
REGIME. WE CAN DO THAT IF WE

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:11.100
MAKE IT JUST TO OUR WAY RIGHTS

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:12.101
AND FRANKLY WHAT IT WHAT IT

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:14.436
COMES DOWN TO IS TAKING THOSE

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:16.305
BIG STORM EVENTS SO LIKE WE HAD

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:17.239

WISH TO INADVERTENTLY- CHANGE

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.929
THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THE BILL

ADEQUATE AND- THE REST OF THE

OPPOSITION HAS TO SAY. BOB BUT

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.143
THE INTENTION IS THAT NONE OF

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:22.577
THESE CONSEQUENCES COME INTO

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:26.081
AFFECT. THAT'S THE INTENTION BUT

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:27.716
THEY HAVE TO BE STRONG ENOUGH

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:29.551
THAT THE BOARD STOPS MISSING

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:32.754
DEADLINES AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:35.357
REQUIRED BY LAW TO UP TO DO

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:35.924
DRESSES JERRY UPDATES THEY

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:39.594
HAVEN'T DONE THEM SO IT NEEDS A

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:41.296
STRONG AND AGAIN I'M WILLING TO

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:43.432
WORK WITH ACWA FOR OTHER STRONG

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:44.933
THINGS LIKE MAYBE WITHHOLDING

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.036
SALARIES BUT I DON'T THINK

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:50.372
THAT'S- LEGAL- BUT- HE COULD DO

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.407
IT TO US WHEN WE MISSED THE

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:54.810
BUDGET BUT I'M NOT SURE YOU

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:57.212
COULD DO A PLOY EASE. SO WE NEED

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.380
TO HAVE SOME TO MAKE SOMETHING

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.349
HAPPEN THAT THIS REALLY WILL

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:02.117
TAKE PLACE MY INTENTION IS THAT

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:04.920
NONE OF THESE. EVER GO INTO

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:09.591
EFFECT. I JUST I JUST HAVE A

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.293
PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL JUST

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.328
BECAUSE I THINK IT DELAYS

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:15.097
PROJECTS IN THE VALLEY. YOU KNOW

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:17.766
SO MOVING FORWARD I DON'T WANT

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:19.634
TO LATEST PROJECTS WE ACTUALLY

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:21.436
WILL PARTY UP PROJECTS BECAUSE

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:24.006
THEY'RE VAN B. FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:26.942
SACRAMENTO FOLKS SAID THAT WE

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:28.310
WANT TO CHANGE WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.779
RIGHT NOW. AND BECAUSE OF THE

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.614
CHANGE IN THE CLIMATE AND YES

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:36.018
THERE'S MUCH MORE RAIN RATHER

01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:38.687
THAN SNOW. IF WE HAVE A STANDARD

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:40.722
THAT IS ADOPTED THEN THE

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.457
REGIONAL WATER BOARD WILL BE

01:17:42.524 --> 01:17:44.993
ABLE TO SAY AHA WE MEET THE NEW

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.129
STANDARD YOU CAN IMPROVE OUR

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:49.164
PLAN AND POTENTIALLY CAN GO MUCH

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:51.566
FASTER SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.268
WHY WE WANT THIS TO HAPPEN AND

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:55.570
HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:56.471
BRING ABOUT ANY OF THE

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:58.206
CONSEQUENCES BUT IN FACT BRINGS

01:17:58.273 --> 01:18:00.242
ABOUT AN AGREEMENT. AT THE END

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:04.679
OF THE SITE NEXT YEAR THANK YOU

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.181
. THREE PURDUE ARE YOU. VERY OF

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:09.885
CONFLICT THANK YOU THIS RUN ITS

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.953
- THANK YOU. IF YOU KNOW MY I'D

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.156
LIKE TO ASK OF THE WITNESSES

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:16.625
CHAIR WITH UP AND OF I WOULD

01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:17.726
LIKE TO HAVE THE WITNESSES

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:20.328
ANSWER THIS QUESTION AND THAT IS

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:24.232
THAT. IF IS THERE A TIME WHEN AN

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:27.135
ACT OF A LOGICAL ACCOUNTABILITY

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:29.538
BILL LIKE WHAT THE DOCTOR

01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:32.307
CORKAGE THIS PROPOSING HERE-

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.810
WOULD NOT HAVE SOME. POTENTIAL

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.711
TO DELAY NOT HAVE SOME POTENTIAL

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.313
TO HAVE WATER IMPACTS ME MY

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.048
POINT HERE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:41.383
WAITING A LONG TIME AND A VERY

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.385
GOOD CASES MADE THAT. YOU

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:45.087
SHOULDN'T JUST ALLOW PEOPLE TO

01:18:45.153 --> 01:18:47.489
JUST KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:49.458
THE ROAD ON THE PLAN. NO MATTER

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:51.993
WHEN WE FINALLY SAY ENOUGH IS

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:55.330
ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO HAVE

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.264
ACCOUNTABILITY. AN ARGUMENT

01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:58.100
COULD BE MADE A YEAR FROM NOW IF

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.302
WE WERE GONNA DO THAT TWO YEARS

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:01.236
FROM NOW THAT ANOTHER PROJECT

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:02.471
WOULD BE POTENTIALLY DELAYED AND

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:03.872
I SHAPE ONLY POTENTIALLY BUILD

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:06.308
DELAYED BECAUSE AS DR CORPORATES

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:07.175
OUT OF EVERYBODY DOES WHAT

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.577
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. THERE

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:09.945
SHOULDN'T BE DELAY WE'RE TALKING

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.413
ABOUT DETAILED MANY OF THESE

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.914
CONSEQUENCES ONLY COME IF THEY

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:15.517
DON'T D THAT DON'T DO THAT SUCH

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.652
AS THAT THAT HYPOTHETICAL. SO IS

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:19.554
THERE SOME WINDOW WHEN THE

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:21.356
LEGISLATURE COULD FINALLY SAY

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:22.491
YOU KNOW FINALLY THERE'S GOING

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:24.292
TO BE A CONSEQUENCE FOR NOT

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:25.994
DOING WHAT STATE LAW SAYS YOU

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.429
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING FOR. A

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:29.965
LONG TIME IS THERE IS THERE EVER

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:32.234
A WINDOW WHEN WE CAN DO THAT OR

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.502
WILL THERE ALWAYS BE. THIS

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:35.337
POTENTIAL THAT THERE'S GONNA BE

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:38.273
SOME DELAY SOME WATER RIGHTS

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.075
QUESTION EXCEPT FOR. WELL THE

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.409
REASON WE TOOK AN OPPOSE UNLESS

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:43.011
AMENDED POSITION IS BECAUSE WE

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:45.013
RECOGNIZE THAT IT HAS BEEN

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.781
SIGNIFICANT TIME. AND THEIR

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:50.719
NEEDS TO BE AN END DATE. BUT WE

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:53.255
SUGGESTED THAT SUBDIVISION AB

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.490
CHANGE TO HIS SOON AS

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:56.391
PRACTICABLE. BECAUSE WERE

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.793
CONCERNED THAT THE DECEMBER

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.729
THIRTY FIRST DEADLINE IN TWENTY

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:02.397

STATE WATER BOARD STAFF

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:05.967
PRESENTATION I DON'T BELIEVE THE

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:07.936
STATE WATER BOARD ITSELF HAS

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.905
SAID. IN A WHICH PATHWAY WITH A

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.873
WANNA USE WHICH STATE DO THEY

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.408
THINK THEY CAN MAKE. SO I THINK

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.410
THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION. BUT

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:16.611
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.813
DEADLINE BEING PROPOSED CUTS THE

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.682
PUBLIC PROCESS PART YOU KNOW

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.617
YOU. YOU CAN'T JAM THE PUBLIC

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:24.686
PROCESS AT THE END WE NEED TO

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:26.588
HAVE COMMITMENT THAT THE PUBLIC

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.089
AT MY PART PARDON ME FOR

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.991
HAPPENED JUST NO TIME IS JUST

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:31.059
ABOUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.360
THINK THE DEADLINE. IS TOO SOON

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:33.862
BUT MY QUESTION ONLY IS THERE

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:37.832
SOME WINDOW WHERE THERE WOULD

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:38.600
NOT BE THESE CONCERNS. SO I

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.135
THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE PROCESS

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:42.103
THAT YOU GET TO THE END POINT

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.838
RIGHT SO I THINK THAT THE

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:45.006
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING EVEN

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:46.474
THOUGH THE BILL'S RELATIVELY

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.043
SHORT THREE SUBDIVISIONS. IT

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:50.812
HIT- COMES INTO A PROCESS THAT

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:52.647
HAS BEEN IN PLAY FOR TWENTY

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:53.949
SEVEN YEARS AND DISRUPTS WATER

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:55.150
RIGHT AND LAW THAT HAS BEEN IN

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:57.118
PLACE SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.453
THE STATE RIGHT SO. IF THE

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.088
PROCESS BY WHICH WE GET TO THAT

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:02.023
AMPULLAE. THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:03.992
CHALLENGE RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:05.994
AS A FAMILY MEMBER VEHICLE WHO I

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.829
WAS ASKING ABOUT THE

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.431
RAMIFICATIONS ON PROJECTS. WE

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:10.232
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:21:10.298 --> 01:21:12.567
HAVING THE LEAST RAMIFICATIONS

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:13.969
ARE PROJECTS ESPECIALLY THOSE

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:16.204
CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECTS AND

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:18.206
SO. YOUR YOUR QUESTION IS A

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:19.207
GREAT QUESTION BUT I THINK IT'S

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:21.042
THE CORE OF THE BELT THAT WE

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:22.577
REALLY NEED TO WORK THROUGH TO

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:24.112
MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL IS

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.113
CONSIDERING THE PROCESS BY WHICH

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.015
WE GET TO THE END POINT. AND SO

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:28.516
THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL CHALLENGE

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:29.618
BECAUSE WE'RE ACCELERATING A

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:31.152
PROCESS WHERE THERE'S A VARIETY

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:33.021
OF PATHWAYS. AND WE NEED TO MAKE

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:35.457
SURE THAT WE TAKE TIME TO GET

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:36.825
THAT PROCESS RIGHT. AND THAT ALL

01:21:36.891 --> 01:21:38.126
VOICES ARE HEARD IN THAT PROCESS

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:39.427
AND THEN WE DON'T DESERVE

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:41.196
CITIZENSHIP SO FOR ME THE

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:45.967
QUESTION THAT I HAVE A SET. OF

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:48.069
WE AN ASSEMBLY WHO IS WILLING TO

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:49.070
CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:50.372
ABOUT THE PROCESS. BUT SHOULD WE

01:21:50.438 --> 01:21:52.040
BEGIN THE PROCESS OF SAYING HEY

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:54.209
ACCOUNTABILITY IS COMING. AND

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:56.978
WE- NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:59.848
BRING THIS TO AN END. AND SO. TO

01:21:59.914 --> 01:22:01.916
IDENTIFY THAT WELL WE DON'T WANT

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:04.352
TO DATE WE WANT TO SAY AS SOON

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:05.387
AS PRACTICABLE. AND COMBINE THAT

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:07.022
WITH THE FOR HIS LEGACY BY MOTOR

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:09.057
FINANCE. IF I IF I COULD IF IT

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:11.593
IS AS IS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.528
JUST ALLOWS SOMEBODY TO KICK THE

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:14.996
CAN DOWN THE ROAD BY SAYING

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.531
WHAT'S NOT PRACTICAL YET BECAUSE

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:17.966
WE'VE GOT THE SITES RESERVOIRS

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:18.933
NOT PRACTICAL YET BECAUSE WE

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.203
HAVE THIS- WE HAVE A- I THINK A

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:24.039
GOOD FAITH EFFORT BEING MADE TO

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.206
SAVE. THERE WILL BE AN EFFORT TO

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:29.644
WORK WITH YOU ON THE PROCESS AND

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:31.513
TO MAKE THAT DISTINCTION- GOOD

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:33.081
FAITH EVER TRY TO WORK ON THE

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:35.417
PROCESS BUT- AT LEAST. IF WE

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:37.052
DON'T BEGIN THE PROCESS NOW OF

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:39.020
ACCOUNTABILITY. MY QUESTION IS

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:41.790
WHEN DO WE BEGIN THE PROCESS OF

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:42.357
ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THIS

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:45.393
LEGISLATURE HAS. JUST ABOUT BEEN

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.095
FILLED TO THE TOP WITH.

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:49.731
CONSTANTLY A SENSE OF THERE IS A

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.700
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO FOLLOW

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:54.703
THROUGH ON STATE. MANDATED

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:57.405
DUTIES OF VARIOUS AGENCIES THANK

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:58.840

YEAH I THINK OF A FEW. I WANTED

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:05.814
CALL UP THE WITNESSES THAT-

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.082
PROVIDED TEST I THINK SOMEONE

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:09.651
GOT A PHONE CALL BUT- THERE IS A

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:12.087
MENTION OF- YOU KNOW AN

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:13.922
EXTINCTION LEVEL EVENT FOR

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:18.760
SMELTS- THAT. YOU KNOW WE MANY

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.428
OF US. MANY OF US I WAS IN

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:23.098
OFFICE FOR- HENDO IS ON THIS

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:25.233
COMMITTEE- AS WE SAW THAT THE

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.701
NUMBERS DWINDLE I CAN'T BELIEVE

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:28.269
I AM PEOPLE PERSON ON THIS

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:30.105

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:36.511
TWENTY SEVEN YEAR DELAYED. YOU

KNOW PLAN THAT DOCTOR QUIRK IS

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:41.683
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE-

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:44.452
GET THIS THING GOING HOW DO WE-

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:47.088
NOT PRESIDE OVER EXTINCTION

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:50.525
LEVEL EVENTS. AND I THINK THAT

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:52.127
PERHAPS. BY THE TIME WE WERE IN

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:54.929
A POLICY MAKING. POSITION AND WE

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:58.767
HAVE THE LAST DROUGHT. THAT- THE

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.568
CARD HAD ALREADY BEEN DEALT-

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:02.670
THAT THAT PERHAPS IT WAS TOO

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:04.172
LATE TO HAVE THE IN AN

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.573
INTERVENTION- THAT WOULD HAVE

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:10.111
CHANGED THE OUTCOME- SO I WANT

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:12.113
TO ASK YOU YOU KNOW. TO LOOK

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.948
BACK AND SAY WHAT WOULD HAVE

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:16.284
THAT WINDOW OF TIME BEEN TO

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:18.052
MAYBE NOT THAT THIS ALONE WOULD

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:20.288
HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM. BUT

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.190
WHAT WE'RE WITH THAT WINDOW OF

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.425
TIME HAVE BEEN AND IF YOU'RE

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:24.959
LOOKING AT THAT WHAT IS THE

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:27.028
PARALLEL TODAY. THAT THAT WE'RE

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:28.496
LOOKING AT THAT WE COULD HAVE

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.331
IMPACTS OF COURSES BILLS MUCH

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:31.633
BIGGER THAN THAN ONLY. AND I

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:33.401
DON'T WANT TO SAY ONLY

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:34.436
EXTINCTION LEVEL EVENTS FOR ANY

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:35.804
SPECIES- BECAUSE THAT IS

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:38.973
IMPORTANT TO NOTE- BUT IF YOU

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.875
CAN JUST KIND OF PROVIDE SOME

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.844
CONTEXT. THE DELTA SMELT. ARE NO

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.446
LONGER FOUND IN THE WILD IN

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:46.648
THEIR HABITAT. THERE ARE SOME

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.283
THAT ARE BEING KEPT IN TANKS.

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:50.251
DOWN IN THE DELTA THERE'S A AS

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:52.187
YOU RELATED BILL. THAT MIGHT

01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:55.390
DEAL WITH THAT LATER. JUSTIN

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:57.358
OKAY THE BILL LATER TODAY AND

01:24:57.425 --> 01:25:00.929
YOU CANNOT CHARM FOR THEM- FOR

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:04.632
THAT BILL SO. PROBABLY AROUND

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:05.333
TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN WERE IN THAT

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.302
DROUGHT NOW THAT I KEEP IN MIND

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:10.338
THAT WAS TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:13.074
LAST SUBSTANTIVE UPDATE. IF IT

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:14.976
HAD BEEN ADDRESSED AT THAT TIME

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:17.779
POSSIBLY THE DELTA SMELT WOULD

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:18.847
STILL EXIST. NOW YOUR QUESTION

01:25:18.913 --> 01:25:21.483
IS WHERE ARE WE ON THE ARC WITH

01:25:21.549 --> 01:25:23.651
SALMON SPRING RUN IT WENT AROUND

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:26.020
SALMON. THEY ARE A THREE YEAR

01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:29.324
LIFE CYCLE FISH. SO THEY'RE

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.459
THEY'RE BORN TO GO OUT TO THE

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:33.461
OCEAN THEY COME BACK THEY BREED

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:35.129
AGAIN THEY DIE THAT'S THEIR LIFE

01:25:35.196 --> 01:25:38.099
CYCLE AND- WE'RE IN THE THIRD

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:40.268
YEAR OF A DROUGHT. THERE MAY BE

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:43.605
A FEW LEFT DOWN 23% OUT MY

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:46.207
GRADING- WHERE WE'RE AT THAT

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:48.243
POINT IF THE STATE BOARD DOESN'T

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.879
ACT. LIKELY WE WILL NOT BE ABLE

01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:52.914
TO TELL YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.415

CHILDREN IT DOES SALMON EXIST

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:58.553
ANYMORE IT IS THAT CRITICAL

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.021
ACCORDING TO THE FISHERY

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:02.724
BIOLOGIST THAT'S WHAT'S AT

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:05.026
STAKE. AND I KNOW I'M GOING TO

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:07.529
DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:09.931
AVOID THAT. OKAY AT THE

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:12.500
MICROPHONE TO SPEAK TO DO IT.

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:14.035
YEAH OKAY- ALL RIGHT WELL THANK

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:17.572

YOU KNOW IN IN MY EXPERIENCE AND

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:29.551
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TECHNICAL

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:31.886
REALITY OF AND DIFFICULTY OF ALL

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:33.321
THAT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:35.189
DO AND HOW YOU KNOW IT'S AS ROOF

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.991
IS IT MAY BE BUT HOW. FAR

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.426
REACHING AND IMPACTING IT CAN BE

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:40.261
THAT OF COURSE THERE'S MORE WORK

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:41.996
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I IN

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:44.365
DR CORK IS MENTIONED YOU KNOW

01:26:44.432 --> 01:26:45.400
WHAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE WHAT HE

01:26:45.466 --> 01:26:48.636
IS TRYING TO DO- AND- AND I

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:50.138
RESPECT THAT. THAT THAT THE

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:51.739
EFFORT IN THE POINT OF HIS BILL.

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:57.378
I I ALSO HAVE- LOOKING BACK.

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:59.180
EIGHT YEARS AGO SEVEN YEARS AGO

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:02.083
AT THAT AT THE LAST DROUGHT. AND

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.851
THINKING THAT THE MOST THAT WE

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:06.187
WERE ABLE TO DO WAS PASSED ON A

01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:09.057
WATER BOND AND DO A GROUND WATER

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:11.659
BILL. I AND I FEEL LIKE WE

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:13.528
MISSED SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:15.496
FOR THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:17.532
WAS JUST SO COMPLETELY GUMMED UP

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:21.369
THAT THAT WE DIDN'T. WE DID NOT-

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:24.205
ADD TO ADEQUATELY PLAN FOR OR

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:26.407
ANTICIPATE THAT THE NEXT DROUGHT

MADE A PRESENTATION SAYING THAT

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:31.292
THEY ARE READY IN THE FALL OF

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:32.193
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE BOARD

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:33.261

ANOTHER YEAR. THEN I'M WILLING

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:40.735

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:42.303
MISTAKE BUT I WOULD BE WILLING

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:44.305

THERE'S BEEN THIRTEEN YEARS OF

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:04.058
THIS I THINK THAT'S LONG ENOUGH

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:05.526
PARTICULARLY SINCE IT'S NOT A

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:07.562
PUBLIC PROCESS RIGHT NOW IN THE

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:08.863
SENSE THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

THE MINISTRATION IS MOVING BUT-

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:19.500
I THINK IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:22.336
THAN WHAT WAS JUST DISCUSSED

A LITTLE BIT TO THAT QUESTION

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:40.288
AND I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THE I

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:42.356
BRED EARLIER THE ARGUMENT ABOUT

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:44.292

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:47.428
FOR PUBLIC INPUT AND THIS IS AT

ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH O

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:54.602
PUBLIC INPUT AND SO IT I THINK

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:56.237
THAT IT IS LEGITIMATE TO SAY

01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:57.672
THERE WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE

01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:59.573
PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY MORE PUBLIC

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.076
AWARENESS MORE PUBLIC INPUT- IF

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:04.078
WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO FOCUS

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:05.947
ON A PLAN THAT DOES REQUIRE

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:08.516
THAT. SO JUST WANT TO THROW THAT

01:33:08.582 --> 01:33:09.417
OUT THERE- TO THE TO THE EXTENT

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:11.519
THAT IT HELPS AND DID THROW OUT

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:13.587
MY OF MY POSITION WHICH WOULD BE

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:15.456

WE SEE THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:21.996
UNTIL A BILL ACTUALLY STARTS TO

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:24.165
MOVE. UNTIL BILL STARTS TO MOVE

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.100
YOU JUST DON'T GET THE

01:33:26.167 --> 01:33:27.134
COMPROMISES YOU DON'T GET PEOPLE

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:28.502
STEPPING FORWARD AND TRYING TO

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:29.904
SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE ISSUES

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:31.973
THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED WHAT'S

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:33.541
WHAT IS GOING TO BE IMPACTS ON

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.382
UP FRONT CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:43.150
THOSE YOU HAVE A BILL

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:44.418
MOVING FORWARD THAT PUTS SOME

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:45.553
PRESSURE ON PEOPLE TO SAY WE'RE

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:47.021
GOING TO DO SOMETHING SO THAT'S

01:33:47.088 --> 01:33:49.290
WHY I RESPECTFULLY JOIN IN WITH

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:51.826
THE AUTHORED TROOPS IN TERMS OF

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:52.860
SAYING- I HOPE THAT WE WOULD

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:54.895
ALLOW THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:56.797

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.825
BILL THIRTEEN YEAR AS LONG AND I

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:26.293
AS THE PUBLIC KEEPS LOOKING AT

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.561
IS TO BE RESPONSIVE ID'S LEAD

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:29.030
LINES ENSURE THAT RESPONSIVENESS

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.297
WHEN WE GO BACK ON TRACK WITH

01:34:30.364 --> 01:34:32.466
THE TRANSCEND THIS DROUGHT- IS

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:34.001
BAD AND IT'S GETTING WORSE AND

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:36.971
WE NEED TO HAVE THE POLITICAL

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:37.571
WILL TO DO WHAT WE DIDN'T DO.

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:38.973
EIGHT YEARS AGO MY COLLEAGUE

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.041
POINTED OUT WHEN I WAS HERE FOR

WHICH I THINK IS REALLY

01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:03.430

WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME- WAS

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:11.138
ALSO- THE QUESTION OF. HOW DO WE

01:45:11.204 --> 01:45:12.406

OTHER ISSUES OR PLACES WHERE WE

01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:25.185
THEN. PUT THEM AND THEN COVER

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:26.286

ISOLATED IN SOME OF OUR AREAS

01:58:52.425 --> 01:58:54.126
BECAUSE OF THIS LARGE PIECES OF

01:58:54.193 --> 01:58:56.128
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN LEAD TO

01:58:56.195 --> 01:58:58.030
INTERBREEDING ALL KINDS OF

01:58:58.097 --> 01:58:59.131
HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR THOSE

01:58:59.198 --> 01:59:04.237
ANIMALS AND A LOT OF STRESSORS-

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:05.905
AND NOW IN TERMS OF THE- PROBLEM

01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:08.107
WITH PUBLIC SAFETY TWO THOUSAND

01:59:08.174 --> 01:59:09.775
SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

01:59:09.842 --> 01:59:11.177
THERE WERE OVER FORTY FOUR

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:12.812
THOUSAND COLLISIONS WITH LARGE

01:59:12.879 --> 01:59:14.847
WILDLIFE IN OUR HIGHWAYS- AS

01:59:14.914 --> 01:59:16.249
REPORTED BY CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY

01:59:16.315 --> 01:59:18.284
PATROL ON AVERAGE FIVE PEOPLE

01:59:18.351 --> 01:59:19.919
ARE KILLED AND OVER TWO HUNDRED

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:21.153
AND FIFTY PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN

01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:22.922
CALIFORNIA REPORTED WILDLIFE

01:59:22.989 --> 01:59:24.357
VEHICLE COLLISIONS EACH EAR.

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:26.058
THE ROAD CALLED YOU CENTER AT UC

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:27.059
DAVIS IS ESTIMATED THE TOTAL

01:59:27.126 --> 01:59:28.628
COST OF REPORTED COLLISIONS

01:59:28.694 --> 01:59:30.463
BETWEEN THIS WILDLIFE AND THIS

01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:32.164
OF THOSE ARE LARGE ANIMALS LIKE

01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:33.199
MULE DEER BEARS AND MOUNTAIN

01:59:33.266 --> 01:59:35.701
LIONS AND VEHICLES TO BE AT

01:59:35.768 --> 01:59:36.302
LEAST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:59:36.369 --> 01:59:39.405
DAMAGE FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:59:39.472 --> 01:59:41.374
TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SO THAT'S

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:42.875
A BIG CHUNK OF CHANGE- NOT TO

01:59:42.942 --> 01:59:44.577
MENTION OF COURSE THE HUMAN AND

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:45.912
WILDLIFE COST AB TWENTY THREE

01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:47.580
FORTY FOUR REQUIRES CALTRANS AND

01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:49.181
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE TO

01:59:49.248 --> 01:59:51.317
IDENTIFY AREAS WITH HIGH RATES

01:59:51.384 --> 01:59:52.919
OF WILDFIRE VEHICLE COLLISIONS

01:59:52.985 --> 01:59:56.856
OVER TARGETING THIS ON AREAS

01:59:56.923 --> 01:59:57.990
WHERE IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE.

01:59:58.057 --> 01:59:59.625
AND TO IMPLEMENT TEN PRIOR PER

01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:00.326
PER YEAR TO IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY

02:00:00.393 --> 02:00:01.827
WITH PASSAGE FEATURES LIKE

02:00:01.894 --> 02:00:03.930
OVERPASSES UNDERPASSES AND

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:06.365
DIAGONAL FENCING TO HELP PREVENT

02:00:06.432 --> 02:00:07.533
THAT THOSE COLLISIONS. BOTH

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.001
STATE AND FEDERAL FOR

02:00:09.068 --> 02:00:10.469

02:00:10.536 --> 02:00:13.339
AVAILABLE FOR THIS TYPES OF

02:00:13.406 --> 02:00:14.807
PROTECTIONS. WILDLIFE CROSSINGS

02:00:14.874 --> 02:00:16.976
CAN IMPROVE WILDLIFE MOVEMENT

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:18.177
WHILE REDUCING WILDLIFE VEHICLE

02:00:18.244 --> 02:00:20.680
COLLISIONS BY UP 298% WHEN

02:00:20.746 --> 02:00:22.915
THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED. SO WHAT

02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:24.417
BETTER PLANNING AND BETTER

02:00:24.483 --> 02:00:26.118

CALIFORNIA IN FACT THIS TWO DAYS

02:02:05.418 --> 02:02:07.019
AGO MY BIOLOGIST PICKED UP A

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:08.921
LARGE ADULT MALE WAS KILLED ON

02:02:08.988 --> 02:02:10.890
THE SIXTY FREEWAY BUT MANY

02:02:10.956 --> 02:02:12.992
FREEWAYS SUCH A BARRIER THAT

02:02:13.059 --> 02:02:14.927
PREVENTED EVEN ATTEMPT TO CROSS

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:16.495
AND AS A RESULT SOME OUTLINED

02:02:16.562 --> 02:02:17.563
POPULATION IN SOUTHERN

02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:19.699
CALIFORNIA ARE AT RISK OF

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:20.966
INBREEDING DEPRESSION AND

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:23.169
POSSIBLY AN EXTINCTION VORTEX.

02:02:23.235 --> 02:02:24.904
WELL I PASSAGE FEATURE ARE

02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:26.372
NECESSARY TO ALLEVIATE THIS

02:02:26.439 --> 02:02:27.973

WILDLIFE IN OTHER AREAS AS WELL

02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:32.244
BUT TO BE EFFECTIVE OTHER

02:02:32.311 --> 02:02:34.580
CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE KEPT IN

02:02:34.647 --> 02:02:36.182
MIND IN ORDER TO ENSURE FUNCTION

02:02:36.248 --> 02:02:37.183
OF ANY CROSSING RESEARCH IS

02:02:37.249 --> 02:02:38.150
USUALLY NEEDED BEFORE

DETERMINE THAT ANSWERS A KEY

02:02:43.656 --> 02:02:45.758
QUESTIONS FUNDING FOR SUCH

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:46.926
RESEARCH OFTEN HAS TO COME

02:02:46.992 --> 02:02:49.395
SEPARATELY FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES

02:02:49.462 --> 02:02:51.097

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:53.232
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

02:02:53.299 --> 02:02:55.000
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE CERTAINLY

02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:56.302
EXPERIENCED WHEN WORKING WITH

02:02:56.368 --> 02:02:58.571
CROSSING DESIGN. QUESTIONS OFTEN

02:02:58.637 --> 02:03:00.139
INCLUDE DEFINING THE SPECIES ARE

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:01.540
MOST CONCERNED WHETHER TRAVEL

BILL IS INCREDIBLY TIMELY

02:04:04.303 --> 02:04:05.571
CALIFORNIA'S RICH BIODIVERSITY

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:07.473
IS BEING DECIMATED BY ROADS AND

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:08.808
LACK OF WHILE THE CONNECTIVITY.

02:04:08.874 --> 02:04:10.142
CALTRANS HAS A KNOWLEDGE OF THIS

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:12.077
ISSUE. THE F. W. IS READY AND

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:13.913
ABLE TO HELP INTEGRATE

02:04:13.979 --> 02:04:14.580
CONNECTIVITY INTO TRANSPORTATION

02:04:14.647 --> 02:04:16.515
PROJECTS. AND THERE'S A PUBLIC

02:04:16.582 --> 02:04:17.349
AWAKENING OF THE GREAT BENEFITS

02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:18.784
OF IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY ON OUR

02:04:18.851 --> 02:04:21.554
ROADS. ISOLATED PUMA POPULATIONS

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.022
COULD DISAPPEAR IN OUR LIFETIMES

02:04:23.088 --> 02:04:24.190
DESERT TORTOISE NUMBERS ARE

02:04:24.256 --> 02:04:26.458
DWINDLING. NEWTS ARE BEING

02:04:26.525 --> 02:04:28.194
KILLED BY THE THOUSANDS EVERY

02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:29.295
YEAR. BIRDS BUTTERFLIES BEAR

02:04:29.361 --> 02:04:32.398
LIZARDS. ALL OF OUR WILD

02:04:32.464 --> 02:04:33.632
NEIGHBORS ARE A GREAT RISK. AND

02:04:33.699 --> 02:04:35.734
SO ARE PEOPLE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:36.502
FRIEDMAN MENTIONED THAT THERE

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:37.803
WERE ABOUT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND

02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:38.804
REPORTED COLLISIONS WITH LARGE

02:04:38.871 --> 02:04:42.174
MAMMALS. FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO

02:04:42.241 --> 02:04:44.076
TWENTY TWENTY ESTIMATED TO COST

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:44.944
CALIFORNIANS MORE THAN ONE

02:04:45.010 --> 02:04:47.213
BILLION DOLLARS. BUT THIS ISN'T

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:48.380
EVEN THE FULL PICTURE. THIRTY

02:04:48.447 --> 02:04:50.015
SUGGEST THE NUMBERS COULD BE

02:04:50.082 --> 02:04:51.951
THREE TO EIGHT POINT FIVE TIMES

02:04:52.017 --> 02:04:53.185
HIGHER. PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS

02:04:53.252 --> 02:04:55.321
REPORT SUCH COLLUSION. OR ADAM

02:04:55.387 --> 02:04:56.355
SURVIVED COLLISION TO DIE FROM

02:04:56.422 --> 02:04:57.089
THEIR INJURIES AWAY FROM THE

02:04:57.156 --> 02:05:00.392
ROAD. FOR EXAMPLE. ONE OF FOR A

02:05:00.459 --> 02:05:01.493
YOUNG MALE PUMA. WAS KILLED IN A

02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:04.363
HIT AND RUN ON PCH. N. O. R.

02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:05.364
NINETY THREE THE ORGAN WILL OF

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:07.166
THAT BUDGET AS FAR SOUTH AS

02:05:07.233 --> 02:05:08.167
VENTURA. WAS FOUND DEAD ON A

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:12.204
DIRT TRAIL NEAR I. FIVE AFTER

02:05:12.271 --> 02:05:14.273
BEING HIT BY A VEHICLE. THESE

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:15.774
DOES ARE. SPECIFICS ARE

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:17.009
PREVENTABLE. ECOSYSTEM COLLAPSE

02:05:17.076 --> 02:05:18.811
IS PREVENTABLE. IN AREAS WHERE

02:05:18.878 --> 02:05:20.012
OTHER STATES HAVE INSTALLED WELL

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:21.914
PLANNED WILDLIFE CROSSINGS.

02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:23.148
VEHICLE WILDLIFE COLLISIONS HAVE

02:05:23.215 --> 02:05:24.717
BEEN BUTTE HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY

02:05:24.783 --> 02:05:26.418
UP TO NINETY EIGHT PERCENT. WELL

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:28.888
FACILITATING WILDLIFE MOVEMENT.

02:05:28.954 --> 02:05:30.756
NOW'S THE TIME TO COMMIT AT THE

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:32.925
STATE TO BUILD MY LIFE CONNECTED

02:05:32.992 --> 02:05:33.726
INTO OUR TRANSFER.

02:05:33.792 --> 02:05:36.061
INFRASTRUCTURE AB TWENTY THREE

02:05:36.128 --> 02:05:37.663
FORTY FOUR WOULD BE A BIG STEP

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:38.931
TOWARDS MAKING BOTH PEOPLE AND

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:40.466
WILDLIFE SAFER WE ASKED THE

YOU MR PRESIDENT- SO YOU HEARD

02:19:47.278 --> 02:19:48.179
THE SUPPORT FROM THE SERIES OF

02:19:48.246 --> 02:19:50.014
HER DISTRICT I'VE ACTUALLY HAD

02:19:50.081 --> 02:19:50.949
THE PRIVILEGE OF WATCHING THE

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:52.550
SHADED FUEL BREAK BEING DONE IN

02:19:52.617 --> 02:19:54.686
MY OWN COMMUNITY ON THE WILDLAND

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:55.353
URBAN INTERFACE THAT DEALS WITH

02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:56.921
INVASIVE SPECIES AND ALSO. PART

02:19:56.988 --> 02:19:58.089
OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHICH I

02:19:58.156 --> 02:20:00.425
THINK IS INCREDIBLES PLANTING

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:01.459
NATIVE SPECIES TO REPLACE THEM

02:20:01.526 --> 02:20:03.361
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK

02:20:03.428 --> 02:20:04.129
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR TO

02:20:04.195 --> 02:20:06.998
REMOVE INVASIVE SPECIES THAT ARE

02:20:07.065 --> 02:20:08.166
CAUSING. THAT YOU'LL THAT WOULD

02:20:08.233 --> 02:20:10.101
BE SO RISKY. OUR COMMUNITIES

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:11.102
THAT ARE RIGHT THERE ON THE WILD

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:13.171
IN URBAN INTERFACES I THINK THIS

02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:14.906
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL AT MY

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:16.541
ONE QUESTION IS. THE BILL IS

02:20:16.608 --> 02:20:17.208
FOCUSED ON CURRENT FUNDING

02:20:17.275 --> 02:20:20.845
SOURCES. AND SO. ALTHOUGH I'VE

02:20:20.912 --> 02:20:22.347
SEEN THAT WORK I THINK IT'S

02:20:22.413 --> 02:20:23.882
REALLY IMPORTANT I WANT TO MAKE

02:20:23.948 --> 02:20:25.116
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT.

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:26.584
PRIORITIZING IN A WAY THAT HARMS

02:20:26.651 --> 02:20:27.952
THE PROTECTION OF COMMUNITIES

02:20:28.019 --> 02:20:29.420
FROM GETTING THE WILDFIRE WORK

02:20:29.487 --> 02:20:30.922
THEY NEED CAN YOU COMMENT ON

02:20:30.989 --> 02:20:32.957
THAT. YEAH CERTAINLY- THAT WON'T

02:20:33.024 --> 02:20:36.427
HAPPEN THIS JUST- WILL TRY TO

02:20:36.494 --> 02:20:38.229
FOCUS THE WORK ON. DOING IN A

02:20:38.296 --> 02:20:40.064
WAY THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE

02:20:40.131 --> 02:20:42.300
FOR THE PARTICULAR AREA- BECAUSE

02:20:42.367 --> 02:20:44.269
LIKE YOU SAID. IF YOU DO THIS

02:20:44.335 --> 02:20:45.170
THE WRONG WAY FOR INSTANCE IF

02:20:45.236 --> 02:20:48.039
YOU TREAT CHAPARRAL THE SAME WAY

02:20:48.106 --> 02:20:49.007
YOU WOULD TREAT A FORESTED AREA.

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:50.241
THOSE THOSE INVASIVE PLANTS JUST

02:20:50.308 --> 02:20:51.075
COME ROARING BACK AND CREATE

02:20:51.142 --> 02:20:53.344
MORE OF A PROBLEM DOWN THE ROAD

02:20:53.411 --> 02:20:55.046
SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:20:55.113 --> 02:20:56.080
THAT EVERY AGENCY. AND EVERY.

02:20:56.147 --> 02:20:57.782
FIRE CREW. I'M HAS THE

02:20:57.849 --> 02:20:59.884
SUPERVISION THAT THEY NEED AND

02:20:59.951 --> 02:21:01.719
YOU KNOW. THAT IT'S REAL THAT

02:21:01.786 --> 02:21:03.087
THE WORK IS TAILORED FOR THE

02:21:03.154 --> 02:21:05.056
TYPE OF MATERIAL IN THIS IS YOU

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:06.291
KNOW AN ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY

02:21:06.357 --> 02:21:07.692
CHAPARRAL. SOCIETY AND OTHER

02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:08.860
FOLKS THAT THEY'VE JUST SEEN

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:09.894
THESE. END UP BEING

02:21:09.961 --> 02:21:11.095
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. SO WE WANT TO

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:13.832
MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THE WORK'S

02:21:13.898 --> 02:21:15.733
