WHAT IS THE TO CLEAN IT UP THE

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:53.483
SHOULD FINISH. TESTIS VERY GOOD

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:56.853
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.127
GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY AND

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.595
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:08.898
IN THE SPACE TODAY- I WANT TO

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:11.100
START OFF BY SAYING THAT I WANT

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.036
TO EMPHASIZE MY DISCOMFORT AND

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:16.172
RELYING ON- AN EXAMPLE OF A MAN

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:18.274
THAT HAS NOT EXPERIENCED TRAUMA

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.443
FROM POLICE VIOLENCE. AS AN

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.145
EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:24.714
USING AS POLICE STANDARDS- I

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:25.581
BELIEVE THAT THE COMMUNITY

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:27.950
SHOULD BE THE COMMUNITY THAT'S

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.719
MOST IMPACTED SHOULD LEAD THIS

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:31.287
BUT HE DID SAY SOME GOOD THINGS

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.656
SO I WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:38.594
STATEMENTS THAT HE MADE- THE

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.462
SECOND THING THAT I WANT TO

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.064
STATE TO IS THAT I AM AN

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.932
ABOLITIONIST AND WHILE I'M

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.068
AWARE THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:48.471
GONNA CHANGE OVERNIGHT AND- WE

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.405
DO NEED TO HAVE REFORMS THAT

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:50.973
ARE IN PLACE AND IT'S HARD TO

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.508
BREATHE AT THIS ON- THE REFORMS

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:54.343
NEED TO LEAN INTO COMMUNITY.

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.646
AND SO WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:57.280
THEY NEED TO PUT COMMUNITY ON A

01:01:57.346 --> 01:02:01.017
PEDESTAL. THEY NEED TO- HAVE

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:03.252
COMMUNITY OVERSEEING EVERYTHING

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:07.156
AND- THEY NEED TO BE- THE DAY

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:08.791
COMMUTING TO BE LEADING IN THE

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.993
DETERMINANT FACTOR. THESE ARE

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.595
THE KIND OF REFORMS THAT ARE

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.129
GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:16.065
CHANGES THAT WE NEED. NOT IN

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.266
RESPONSE TO THE POLICING

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:19.402
PRINCIPLES BY SIR ROBERT PEEL

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:19.936
I'M GOING TO PROVIDE MORE

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:22.405
CONTEXT TO CONTEXT ON BEHALF OF

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.874
THE MOST IMPACTED. IN REGARDS

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:25.475
TO THE STATE OF POLICING AS IT

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:29.145
IS TODAY. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:30.713
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.082
ELECTED OFFICIALS SO WE HAVE

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:34.350
CHECKS AND BALANCES PUT IN

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:36.385
PLACE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:37.220
THAT OUR POLICE ARE HELD

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:39.188
ACCOUNTABLE. BUT IT IS VERY

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.423
PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU HAVE FOR

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.991
EXAMPLE A SHERIFF AND A DA THAT

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:44.727
OUR FRIENDS. GOING TO BARBECUES

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:45.728
IN DOING THINGS OUTSIDE OF WORK

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:47.296
TOGETHER. BUILDING

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:48.498
RELATIONSHIPS IN BEING BEHOLDEN

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:49.832
TO EACH OTHER THERE'S NO

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.467
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT CAN BE HAD

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:52.034
WHEN RELATIONSHIPS ARE BUILT

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.769
LIKE THAT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:55.872
WOULD BE THE CITY MANAGER AND

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:56.672
THE POLICE BUT THE POLICE CHIEF

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:58.674
SO. THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.576
RELATIONSHIPS. BETWEEN LAW

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.478
ENFORCEMENT AND IT'S CHECKS AND

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:06.382
BALANCES THAT ARE. NOT HELPFUL

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:09.652
TO GETTING ACCOUNTABILITY. ALSO

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:11.454
POLICIES AND LEGISLATION THAT

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:12.822
DOES NOT INCLUDE REPERCUSSIONS

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:15.091
ATTACHED TO THEM. SO WE'VE HAD

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.325
A LOT OF GOOD BILLS COME OUT

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:17.593
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF POLICY

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.594
CHANGES HERE LOCALLY IN

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.496
SACRAMENTO. BUT IF THEY'RE NOT

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.365
INCLUDING ANY TYPE OF

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:25.234
REPERCUSSION OR ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.603
INSIDE OF THOSE POLICIES IN

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:28.137
THEIR VIOLATED AND THERE'S

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:30.273
NOTHING THAT HAPPENS WE'VE SEEN

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:31.874
EVERYTHING THAT'S COME FORTH

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.309
SINCE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:35.678
GET VIOLATED AND THERE'S NEVER

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:37.647
ANY REPERCUSSIONS. IN THE

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:38.748
COMMUNITY NEEDS TO SEE THE

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:39.849
REPERCUSSIONS THE COMMUNITY

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.217
NEEDS TO IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:42.084
TRUST THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.319
BUILDING BETWEEN LAW

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:44.253
ENFORCEMENT AND CAR OUR

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.722
COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO BE ABLE

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:49.659
TO SEE THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.761
ALSO VETTING OFFICERS- FOR

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:54.764
INVOLVEMENT WITH. WHITE

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:55.298
NATIONALIST GROUPS AND OR

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:58.034
MALICIOUS I PERSONALLY KNOW TWO

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.969
OFFICERS IN THE SACRAMENTO

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.103
POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT ARE

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.838
ASSOCIATED WITH WHITE

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:06.142
SUPREMACIST GROUPS. ONE HAS AN

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:06.742
EIGHTY EIGHT TATTOOED ON HIS

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:08.911
HAND WITH THE DIAMOND TIPS

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:10.413
WHICH STANDS FOR IT'S A HOW

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.815
HITLER TATTOO. AND THEN OTHERS

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:14.850
USE LANGUAGE CALLED OUR ALLIES

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:17.720
REYES TRADERS SO IF WE'RE NOT

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:19.255
HAVING A PROCESS TO VET OUR

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.791
OFFICERS ON. THEIR INVOLVEMENT

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:23.292
WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS EITHER

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.528
CULTURE ORGANIZATIONS THEN

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.096
WE'RE FAILING BECAUSE IT'S

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:28.564
ATTRACTIVE TO THOSE TYPES TO BE

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:29.865
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TO HAVE

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:32.768
THE POWER TO KILL BLACK PEOPLE

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:33.402
AND NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:38.241
IT. ALSO THE MENTALITY OF LAW

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:39.976
ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY'RE AT WAR

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:44.880
WITH THE PEOPLE. THEY'RE TAKING

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.649
THE SENTIMENT THE CENTER THAN

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.217
SENTIMENT TO THE STREETS WHEN

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.152
THEY'RE COMING TO OUR PROTESTER

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.955
COMING TO OUR MARCHES WERE

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:53.556
EXERCISING OUR FIRST AMENDMENT

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:57.126
RIGHTS. THEY'RE SHOOTING OUR

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:57.793
CHILDREN IN THE FACE WITH

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.528
RUBBER BULLETS. THEY'RE

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:01.197
SHOOTING OUR FOLKS IN THE HEAD

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:03.065
WITH A RUBBER BULLETS OVER THIS

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.900
LAST COUPLE MONTHS WE HAD THREE

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.802
MAJOR INJURIES AT THE HANDS OF

01:05:06.869 --> 01:05:08.838
LAW ENFORCEMENT ONE WAS A

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:09.505
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD THAT WAS SHOT

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.107
IN THIS IS FACING HE BROKE HIS

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:13.542
CHEEKBONE. WITH A RUBBER BULLET

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:15.011
AND IT'S AND I JUST WANT TO

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.178
EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT IT

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.546
SEEMS LIKE ALL OF THESE.

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.915
INCIDENTS OUR OFFICERS AIMING

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:20.816
AT THE FACE IN THE HEAD OF

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.551
PEOPLE WITH BULLETS THAT THEY

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:24.053
THINK ARE LEAST LESS LEGAL

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.355
FORMS OF FORCE BUT THEY CAN

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.823
BECOME. LEGAL IN THAT WAY. ON

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.526
THE SECOND WAS- A SACRAMENTO

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.962
RESIDENT. THAT WAS SHOT SIX

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.430
TIMES IN THE HEAD WITH RUBBER

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:37.533
BULLETS HAVEN'T HAD A- A

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.100
FRACTURED SCHOOL AND HAD TO

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.403
HAVE SURGERY. AND THEN LASTLY

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:43.039
AT ONE OF OUR PROTESTS- A

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.140
TEENAGE GIRL WAS SHOT IN HER

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:45.875
EYES SHE'S NO LONGER ABLE TO

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:49.211
pOF HER LIFE. SO THIS IS THE

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:50.112
KIND OF VIOLENCE THAT WE'RE

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:52.982
FACING ONE WERE. ACTUALLY

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:53.549
PROTESTING THE VIOLENCE THAT

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.351
WE'VE BEEN FACING. WHERE WERE

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:56.886
BEING MET WITH THE EXACT SAME

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:58.954
VIOLENCE THAT WERE THAT WERE

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:03.225
TRYING TO STOP HAVING HAPPENED.

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:04.527
AND I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:06.028
THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:08.331
PROTESTS. FOR FOLKS THAT

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:10.566
SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP ON A

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.668
WEEKLY BASIS AND THEY ARE NOT

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:15.204
MET WITH THAT SAME BY VIOLENCE

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.038
SO THERE'S DEFINITELY A RACIAL

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:18.741
BIAS. WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:19.875
WHITE FOLKS GOING UP TO THE

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:21.610
CAPITOL AND ACTING VIOLENT

01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:24.413
TOWARD COMMUNITY. THERE IS NO

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.816
NATIONAL GUARD BEING CALLED.

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:27.350
THERE IS NO RUBBER BULLETS

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.585
BEING SHOT. THERE IS NO

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.154
HELICOPTERS THERE IS NO

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:35.391
VIOLENCE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT-

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:35.958
SO I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.795
THAT AS WELL. ALSO UNITS LIKE

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.197
IN EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:42.932
THESE BUT LIKE THE GANG TASK OR

01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:44.500
GANG ENFORCEMENT TEAMS GETTING

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:48.304
TASK UNITS- TEAMS LKE POP

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:49.238
UNITS PROBLEM ORIENTED POLICING

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:52.007
UNITS. THESE UNITS GOING TO

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.008
THEY SPECIFICALLY AND

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.243
INTENTIONALLY GOING TO BLACK

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.112
AND BROWN COMMUNITIES TO

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.480
SPECIFICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:59.315
RACIALLY PROFILE PEOPLE BASED

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:00.850
ON THINGS LIKE HAIRSTYLES AND

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:02.218
CLOTHING CHOICES THINGS THAT

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:04.420
AREN'T NECESSARILY PARTICULAR

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:05.621
TO GANG MEMBERS OR EVEN TO

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:08.124
BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. AND

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.724
THERE'S A LOT OF VIOLENCE IN

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.926
OUR COMMUNITY. THAT ISN'T

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.528
CONNECTED TO THE ACTIVISTS BUT

YOU KNOW THE VIOLENCE AN

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:14.263
ACTIVIST COMMUNITY BUT THERE'S

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:16.165
A LOT OF VIOLENCE IN OUR BLACK

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:18.267
AND BROWN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:19.635
OF THESE TEAMS AND THEIR

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:21.337
AUTHORITY IN THEIR POWER AND

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.606
THEIR THEIR LACK OF ANY TYPE OF

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:24.473
CONNECTION TO THESE

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.008
COMMUNITIES. THEY DON'T LIVE IN

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.143
THESE COMMUNITIES THEY DON'T

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:28.878
CARE ABOUT THESE PEOPLE THEY

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:29.912
DON'T LOOK LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:31.781
THEY'RE POLICING AND SO THAT

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:34.216
THAT HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:39.822
THAT IS REFORMED. ALSO WE SEE A

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:44.627
LOT OF. PROCRASTINATION AND IT

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:47.530

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:55.538
PROCRASTINATION COMES IN THE

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:58.741

THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.838

SOMEBODY MAY GET SHOT IN THE

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:32.475

THEIR ACTIONS- WE'VE DANCED

01:08:58.434 --> 01:08:59.568

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:08.410

KILLED SOMEBODY AND IT WAS

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.481

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:17.119
PUNISHMENT. I'M A LOT OF TIMES

POLICE REFORM. HOW

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:10.759
PROFESSIONALISM IS AT THE CORE

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:12.661
OF AFFECTED POLICING AND

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.363
IMPORTANTLY THE STATE'S ROLE IN

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.964
CREATING THE SYSTEMS NECESSARY

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:18.000
TO ENABLE PROFESSIONALISM. THAT

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.635
CAN HELP BUILD PUBLIC TRUST

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:21.904

PROFESSIONAL AND ACADEMIC

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.341
EXPERIENCE AS A FORMER FEDERAL

OF SPECIALIZED POLICE AGENCY

AND ALSO WAS AN LAPD OFFICIAL

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:39.688
RESPONSIBLE FOR REFORM EFFORTS.

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.690
I HAVE LEARNED IN BELIEVE THERE

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.625
ARE THREE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:45.728
TO MEANINGFUL REFORM. FIRST

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:47.463
MEANINGFUL REFORM MUST ADDRESS

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:49.231
THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF POLICING

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.833
AND FOCUS ON THE QUALITY OF

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.735
OFFICERS WHO WERE RECRUITED AND

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.136
CERTIFIED TO SERVE IN THESE

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.438
IMPORTANT ROLES. THE STANDARDS

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:58.474
WHILE AN OFFICER IN THE

01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.575
ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:02.244
NECESSARY TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.213
SECOND REFORMS MUST ENABLE

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:05.914
AGENCIES TO PERFORM ITS CORE

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.750
FUNCTION OF PROTECTING

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:09.318
COMMUNITIES FROM CORPORATE FROM

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:11.520
CRIME. WELL STRENGTHENING THE

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:12.554
PUBLIC'S TRUST THROUGH

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.323
COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:16.125
CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING AND

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.860
PURSUING JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:21.630
THROUGH FAIR AND UNBIASED

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:22.965
ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW. IN

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:24.233
MEANINGFUL REFORMS MUST BE

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:27.002
BASED ON PROVEN EVIDENCE BASED

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.104
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PRACTICAL

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:30.539
AND CAN BE APPLIED FOR LONG

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:33.041
TERM IMPACT. AS I MENTIONED IN

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:34.343
MY TESTIMONY ON OCTOBER

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.478
FOURTEENTH PROFESSIONALISM IN

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.846
THE SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES OF

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.715
PROFESSIONALISM THAT ALREADY

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:41.850
EXIST FOR THE PROFESSIONS WE

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.786
KNOW AND RESPECT SUCH AS BEING

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:46.121
IN SUCH AS DOCTORS. LAWYERS

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:48.223
ENGINEERS AND THE TEACHERS AND

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:50.192
TEACHERS ARE THE KEY TO

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:52.561
ACHIEVING THESE ELEMENTS OF

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:54.696
MEANINGFUL REFORM IN POLICING.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.965
WE KNOW THIS BOTH FROM OUR OWN

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:58.901
COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE THE

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.202
EXPERIENCE OF AGENCIES THAT

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.970
HAVE MADE PROGRESS ON REFORM

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.305
THROUGH CONSENT DECREES IN

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:04.840
ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP LIKE

01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:07.810
THE LAPD. AND WITH OVER FORTY

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:09.311
YEARS OF SOUND ACADEMIC

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.613
RESEARCH. WHY IS IT THAT

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.348
PROFESSIONALISM POLICING IN

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:15.217
ESSENCE IS SO IMPORTANT AND I

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.718
STRONGLY BELIEVE WILL HAVE A

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.854
POSITIVE IMPACT ESPECIALLY THE

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.489
EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS TO

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:22.891
BE CONSIDERED. AND WHY ARE THEY

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:25.394
SO IMPORTANT. IS BECAUSE AT ITS

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:28.063
CORE THE DISCIPLINE OF POLICING

FACING CURRENTLY ARE NOT SIMPLY

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.118
A FUNCTION OF ROOTING OUT THE

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:05.721
BAD APPLES WITHIN AN AGENCY IT

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.823
IS MUCH BROADER AND WE NEED TO

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.157
RECRUIT CERTIFY AND FURTHER

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:11.259
DEVELOP OFFICERS TO MAKE GOOD

DECISIONS UNDER VERY DIFFICULT

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:15.030
CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY'D USE

CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS TO

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:17.499

MAKING SKILLS IN MAKING THESE

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:29.311
POWERFUL. EXERCISING THEIR

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:31.713
DISCRETION TO TAKE AWAY- THE

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.716
LIBERTY OR LIFE OF SOMEONE. WE

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:35.751
OF COURSE NEED OFFICERS WITH

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:36.818
DEEP KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:38.620
EXPERTISE RESILIENCE PATIENCE

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.555
AND PROFESSIONAL MATURITY BUT

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:41.757
MOST IMPORTANTLY CRITICAL

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.058
THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:46.561
SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES. ARE SO

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:47.662
CRITICAL ARE SO ESSENTIAL. SO

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.164
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT OF

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:50.665
PROFESSIONALISM THAT IS LACKING

01:17:50.732 --> 01:17:52.934
IN THE ENTRY LEVEL STANDARDS IS

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.136
OF COURSE A COLLEGE EDUCATION.

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:56.304
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA IS

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.006
INSUFFICIENT FOR ANY PROFESSION

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.208
LET ALONE A PROFESSION OF SUCH

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:01.977
A VAST DISCRETION COMPLEXITY

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:03.545
AND THE NEED FOR PUBLIC TRUST

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.614
AS POLICING. AND WHILE SOME

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.449
INCENTIVES EXISTING AGENCIES IT

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:10.085
IS NOT UNIFORM IT ONLY FORMS A

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:10.886
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF MANY

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.921
AGENCIES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:14.823
THIS IS NOT A NEW NOVEL OR

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:17.526
SPECULATIVE IDEA IT IS BASED ON

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:19.494
EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH THAT

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:22.531
SPANS ALMOST FORTY YEARS. THE

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:24.199
SITE THERE'S MANY CITATIONS IN

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:26.068
THE WORK OF WILLIAM TERREL IN

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.302
OTHER PROFESSORS AND SOME OF

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:28.737
THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:30.739
FRAMEWORKS WILL OR ACT IN THE

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:32.374
CALIFORIA POLICE CHIEFS

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:33.141
ASSOCIATION WHICH IS REALLY

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.410
PROMISING. BUT THE EMPIRICAL

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:37.045
RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:38.780
OFFICERS OF THE FOR YOUR

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:40.749
COLLEGE EDUCATION HAVE MORE

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.084
POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:43.385
COMMUNITIES THAN THOSE WITH

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:44.986
ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:46.721
ARE BETTER PROBLEM SOLVERS AND

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:48.323
INNOVATORS A BETTER

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.092
COMMUNICATION SKILLS BOTH

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:51.860
VERBAL AND WRITTEN. ARE MORE

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:53.328
OPEN MINDED TO DIFFERENT

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.263
PERSPECTIVES AND IDEAS RECEIVE

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:56.932
BETTER PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS

01:18:56.998 --> 01:18:58.366
FROM THEIR SUPERVISORS AND

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:00.202
POLICE LEADERSHIP HAVE FEWER

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.269
CITIZEN COMPLAINTS AND

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:03.405
DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. AND VERY

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:05.273
IMPORTANTLY YOU SIGNIFICANTLY

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.343
LESS FORMS OF FORCE IN OTHER

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:09.611
FORMS OF COERCION TO GAIN

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:11.580
COMPLIANCE. THERE IS MORE

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:12.881
EVIDENCE THAT A FOUR YEAR

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:14.516
COLLEGE EDUCATION CAN ADDRESS

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.951
THE ISSUES WE ARE DISCUSSING IN

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:17.719
AMERICA TODAY. THAN ANY OTHER

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.921
POLICY TACTIC OR RESTRICTION

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:22.257
CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED. AND

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:23.391
IF COUPLED WITH THE SYSTEM OF

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:24.726
STANDARDS ACCOUNTABILITY

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:26.228
OVERSIGHT IT CAN MAKE A

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:28.029
MEANINGFUL LONG TERM DIFFERENCE

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:30.132
IN POLICING. YEAH THIS IS

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:32.467
NEITHER EASY NOR FREE AND IT

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.136
HAS TO BE THOUGHTFUL MEASURED

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:35.871
AND AT A PACE THAT AGENCIES CAN

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.906
ADAPT TO THEIR VARYING SIZE AND

01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:40.108
CAPABILITIES. IT MUST MAKE SURE

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:41.443
TO MITIGATE UNINTENDED

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:42.744
CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS THE

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:44.813
DISPARATE IMPACT ON MINORITIES

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.583
AND OTHER RECRUITMENT. YOU'LL

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:49.184
HEAR IT SOON AND THEN X. ALL

01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:50.218
ABOUT RICK. AND THEM SO WE'LL

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:51.586
TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AND

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:53.722
THOSE CHALLENGES ARE REAL. BUT

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:55.724
THERE ARE FINANCIAL PATHWAYS IN

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:57.792
WAYS TO MITIGATE THOSE ISSUES

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.127
BY PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:00.729
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLEASE

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:03.632
CANDIDATES AND LOOKING AT OTHER

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:05.767
MODELS LIKE THE U. S. MILITARY.

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:06.835
IN CONCLUSION I JUST WANT TO

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:09.371
SAY THE POLICING CAN BE SEEN AS

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:11.573
A JOB A CAREER OR WHAT BUT I

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.774
BELIEVE IT IS WHICH IS A

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:15.076
PROFESSIONAL CALLING. IT IS AND

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:16.811
SHOULD BE A PROFESSIONAL

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:18.780
CALLING SIMILAR TO WHAT. WE'VE

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:20.749
SEEN IN MANY INDIVIDUAL

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:22.784
OFFICERS AND SOME AGENCIES IN

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.352
CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:26.354
COUNTRY. BUT IF POLICING IS

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:28.823
TRULY TO BE A PROFESSION AS ALL

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.659
COMMUNITIES EXPECT AND DESERVE

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.194
THEN WOMEN WE MUST ESTABLISH

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.795
THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:35.530
PROFESSIONALISM. THAT WE

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:37.766
HAVEN'T EXPECT FOR OUR TEACHERS

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.668
DOCTORS LAWYERS AND ENGINEERS.

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:41.069
IT IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL METHOD

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:42.370
TO NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:44.639
OF REFORM BUT WILL ALSO RESULT

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:46.541
IN SAFER COMMUNITIES WITH THE

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:49.878
STRENGTH OF THE PUBLIC'S TRUST.

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:50.412
THAT WE ARE ALL SEEKING TO

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.581
ACHIEVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:54.149

BELIEVE THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY ON

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:04.125
POINT AND YOU TALKED ABOUT EVEN

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:05.427

YOU BACK- I STARTED MY CAREER

FORTY YEARS AGO IN SANTA MONICA

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:02.877
POLICE DEPARTMENT. ENDED MY

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:05.280
UNIFORM CAREER TEN YEARS AGO AT

AND INTELLIGENCE. IN BETWEEN I

01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:13.321
WAS REALLY HONORED TO SERVE.

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:15.657
THE FBI SPECIAL AGENT WORKING

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.459
FOR COUNTER INTELLIGENCE AND

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:18.259
TERRORISM AS A MEMBER THEIR

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:21.196
SWATI. SO ALL THAT HAPPENED HE

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:22.397
SAID. I DIDN'T GROW UP ANY

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:23.365
DIFFERENT THAN AN AFRICAN

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:25.266
AMERICAN. BEING SUBJECTED TO

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.068
POLICE MISCONDUCT AND ABUSE IS

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:28.570
A YOUNG MAN WHICH IS ONE OF THE

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:29.404
REASONS THAT I BECAME A POLICE

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:31.806
OFFICER. BECAUSE MY DAD USED TO

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:32.741
SAY YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:35.677
CAPSICUM OUTSIDE TOMORROW. SO

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:36.911
PART OF THAT CHANGE. WHAT I

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:38.380
WANT TO TALK ABOUT FIRST IS

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:41.383
THAT AS WE TALK AS WE DISCUSS.

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:43.785
CHANGE AND REFORM REFORM HAS TO

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.720
BE A TOP TO BOTTOM EFFORT.

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:46.521
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:48.590
RECRUITMENT IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF

01:23:48.656 --> 01:23:49.491
THIS MENTION THAT I WAS A

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:50.658
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATOR

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:52.293
ESTIMATES APPEAR VERY FAMILIAR

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.229
WITH RECRUITMENT. I WAS ALSO A

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:56.097
LITTLE STRUCTURE AND ACADEMY

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:59.267
FACULTY MEMBER WE ARE HONDA

01:23:59.334 --> 01:23:59.868
POLICE ACADEMY SO I UNDERSTAND

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:00.869
THAT VERY WELL. AT THE SAME

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:01.903
TIME WE GOT A WHOLE CHIEF

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.438
ACCOUNTABLE. SHE'S ARE

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:05.006
APPOINTED BY MAYORS AND CITY

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:06.808
COUNCILS WE DIDN'T MAKE NEED TO

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:09.010
MAKE SURE THEY GOT THE BEST

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:09.644
PERSON. WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THAT

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.613
SELECTION. SO HAVING SAID THAT

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:13.281
LET'S TALK ABOUT PROGRAMS. AS

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:14.949
MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WE NEED

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:17.185
PROGRAMS THAT ENGAGE THE

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.753
DESIRED DEMOGRAPHIC OF PEOPLE

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.855
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IT'S

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.791
TIME FOR US TO MINIMIZE THE

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:24.626
TERM CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND MOVED

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:25.660
TO A TERM OF TRANSFORMATIVE

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:26.995
JUSTICE BY THAT I MEAN BUILDING

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.730
COMMITTEE. FROM A PLACE OF

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:30.865
POWER. WE HAVE TO MOVE AWAY

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:32.667
FROM AN OFFENDER BASED PLATFORM

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.235
OF EDUCATING PEOPLE IN THAT

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:35.503
SYSTEM. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:38.506
GONNA BE DOING THIS COMING YEAR

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:39.107
AND THE STOCK PRICE SCHOOL OF

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:40.141
PUBLIC POLICY. ONE OF THE

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.576
REASONS THAT WE HAVE CHALLENGES

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:43.244
THAT QUITE OFTEN. THE

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:44.279
INTERACTION BETWEEN YOUNG

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:45.747
PEOPLE IN THE POLICE ARE ALWAYS

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:47.849
INTERACTS THE CONFLICT. ALWAYS

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.984
INTERACTIONS OF DISPUTE.

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:52.420
FORTUNATELY I WAS. POWER PIECE

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:53.988
ACT OF POLICE ACTIVITIES LEAGUE

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:55.190
KID WHEN I GREW UP IN NEW

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:56.724
JERSEY AND I HAD THOSE

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.059
INTERACTIONS WITH OFFICERS THAT

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:58.960
WAS MORE POSITIVE I PLAY

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:00.829
SPORTS. ENGAGED IN OTHER

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:02.964
ACTIVITIES I'M REALLY PROUD TO

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.199
SAY I'M ONE OF THE FOUNDERS CO

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:07.168
FOUNDERS. OF THE PAL PROGRAM IN

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.470
SANTA MONICA PD. I THINK THESE

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:10.338
PROGRAMS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:12.073
AS WE TRY TO HAVE. A

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.541
DEMOGRAPHIC OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:14.709
AGENCIES THAT REFLECT THE

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.411
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE.

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:18.313
ADEPT PROGRAMS BUT MORE

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:20.281
IMPORTANTLY IT SPEAK ABOUT THIS

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:21.149
I'M NOT GOING TO EXCLUDE

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:22.917
PROGRESSIVES YOU KNOW TOO MANY

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:24.919
QUESTIONS THE SUGGESTION TO

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:26.354
JOIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:28.056
MAYBE CHARITY INTUITIVE OR EVEN

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:29.724
OFFENSIVE. BUT IF THERE WERE

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:30.859
MORE POLICE OFFICERS WHO CARED

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.093
ABOUT THE THINGS PROGRESSIVE

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.696
WALK LIKE MINIMIZING POLICE

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.097
VIOLENCE. FINDING ALTERNATIVES

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:37.966
TO INCARCERATION AND ENSURING

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:39.934
THE RIGHT TO PEACEFUL PROTEST

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:42.971
WE ALL BENEFIT. A NEW

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:44.072
GENERATION OF PROGRESSIVE

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:45.840
LEANING POLICE OFFICERS WOULD

01:25:45.907 --> 01:25:48.009
HARDLY BE A NEW TO SAY RACIAL

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:49.744
BIAS BUT THESE OFFICERS MIGHT

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.679
BE OPEN TO SCRUTINIZING THEIR

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:54.115
BEHAVIOR FOR EVIDENCE OF BIAS.

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.450
WE HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:57.151
PARTNERSHIP AS WE TALK ABOUT

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:58.753
RECRUITING AND PROGRAMS THAT

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.256
ENGAGE THE PUBLIC. SO WITH THAT

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:03.324
LET ME MOVE ON TO EDUCATION HAS

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:05.093
BEEN MENTIONED BY MY ESTEEMED

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:06.828
COLLEAGUE ARAFAT THE CONVOY OF

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:09.364
NORTH MANY YEARS. AND I WANT TO

01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:10.899
MENTION THAT I ALSO SERVING THE

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:11.733
INTERNATIONAL SO SHE'S OF

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:13.334
CHIEFS OF POLICE RESEARCH

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.003
ADVISORY BOARD AND DATA IS

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:16.871
IMPORTANT HIS COMMENTS ABOUT

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:19.807
THE FACT IT. EDUCATED OFFICERS

01:26:19.874 --> 01:26:23.545
USE FORCE ARE LESS LIKELY TO

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:25.380
USE FORCE IS VERY TELLING. WE

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:26.881
HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:27.949
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS SO THE

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:30.051
FBI AS YOU KNOW REQUIRES A

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.686
BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AND A PERSON

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:33.621
IS TWENTY FOUR THREE YEARS OF

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:35.523
AGE TO APPLY TO BUREAU. IT WILL

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:37.058
BE INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:39.594
AVERAGE AGE OF AN INCOMING.

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:40.728
AGENT AT NEW AGENTS CLASS

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:42.397
QUANTICO IS THIRTY YEARS OF

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:44.732
AGE. THAT IS VERY TELLING

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:45.867
BECAUSE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THEY

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:48.803
GOT A LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT ALSO

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:50.905
ADDS TO THE ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:51.839
WHICH MAKES THEM MORE IN TUNE

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.708
PERHAPS TO DEALING WITH THE

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:54.576
PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:56.711
ADDRESS. WE TRIED THAT MODEL

01:26:56.778 --> 01:26:58.079
SANTA MONICA PD OVER FORTY

01:26:58.146 --> 01:26:59.881
YEARS AGO. WE HAD TEN

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:01.182
APPLICANTS WHO ALL HAVE

01:27:01.249 --> 01:27:03.184
BACHELOR'S DEGREES.

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:03.952
SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.820
ACADEMY WHEN THEY GOT TO THE

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:07.522
FIELD TRAINING OFFICERS PROGRAM

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.324
OR FTO PROGRAM NINE OF THEM

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:11.693
FAIL. I JOKINGLY ALWAYS SAY TO

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:14.529
PEOPLE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:15.163
BETWEEN BEING INTELLIGENT BEING

01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:16.564
SMART. AND AS WAS PREVIOUSLY

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:17.899
MENTIONED. THE ACADEMY TIME

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:20.969
FRAME. IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES

01:27:21.035 --> 01:27:23.404
IS FAR MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THE

01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:25.106
SIX MONTHS WE ALLOWED HERE IN

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:25.640
CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:28.543
STATES. OFFICERS PROBABLY SPEND

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:30.878
ABOUT 223% OF THEIR TIME IN THE

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:32.880
FIELD MAKING A DECISION ON

EARLIER BY ONE OF THE SPEAKERS-

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:38.672

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:41.042

ALSO WITH DIVERSITY- AND THAT

01:35:04.265 --> 01:35:04.799
IS ONE OF THE LARGEST

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:06.033
CHALLENGES THAT EVERY CHIEF

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.601

THE LAST COUPLE OF THE OVER THE

01:35:20.581 --> 01:35:22.550
LAST YEAR THAT HAS CHANGED AND

01:35:22.616 --> 01:35:23.918
I'D HASN'T CHANGED TO THE POINT

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:25.820
WHERE WE WANT IT. BUT OUR

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:28.022

DIVERSITY IS UP SO I WANT TO

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:32.626
TALK A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT HOW WE

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:33.727
ACCOMPLISHED IN SOME OF THE

01:35:33.794 --> 01:35:35.763
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:36.464
TERMS OF HIRING HIGHLY

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:39.366

HUNDRED APPLICANTS FOR POLICE

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:50.044
OFFICERS. AND BY THE WAY WE

01:35:50.111 --> 01:35:51.412
REQUIRE TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE TO

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:53.747
BE A POLICE OFFICER- AND I

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:54.849
STARTED WHEN I WAS NINETEEN

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:56.884
YEARS OLD- SO I DIDN'T HAVE A

01:35:56.951 --> 01:36:01.288
DEGREE AND I WASN'T. NINETY SO

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:03.257
AGAIN ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO WE

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:04.692
HAD SIXTY SIX HUNDRED

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:06.160
APPLICANTS LAST YEAR TWO

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:07.728
THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. WE ONLY

HAD TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED OUT.

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:10.931
AND OUT OF THOSE TWENTY EIGHT

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:12.600
HUNDRED APPLICANTS WE FOUND

01:36:12.666 --> 01:36:15.236
SEVENTY THREE PEOPLE. SUITABLE

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:15.870
FOR BEING HIRED AND SENT TO THE

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:17.505
ACADEMY. THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE

01:36:17.571 --> 01:36:19.840
BIT OF IDEA OF HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:23.644
HAVE TO APPLY JUST TO FIND SAY

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:24.178
SEVENTY THREE. AND WE HAVE

01:36:24.245 --> 01:36:25.813
DROPPED. OVER HALF THE NUMBER

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.414
OF APPLICANTS THAT APPLIED IN

01:36:27.481 --> 01:36:29.517
THE TRADITIONAL WAY. THIS YEAR

01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:30.918
THROUGH NOVEMBER SO STILL WITH

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:33.988
ANOTHER MONTH TO GO. WE'VE HAD

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:35.322
TWENTY NINE ALMOST THREE

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:36.557
THOUSAND APPLICANTS AND WILL

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:38.192
PROBABLY GET MAYBE A HUNDRED OR

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:39.059
TWO HUNDRED MORE BEFORE THE END

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:40.794
OF THE YEAR. AND OUT OF THOSE

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.696
APPLICANTS WE FOUND EIGHTY

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:43.330
THREE THAT MAKE IT THROUGH THE

01:36:43.397 --> 01:36:45.132
PROCESS AND MAKE IT THROUGH THE

01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:47.902
BACKGROUND. SO PEOPLE ARE NO

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:50.504
LONGER APPLYING THE TRADITIONAL

01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:52.773
WAY TO BE POLICE OFFICERS- YOU

ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:57.011
SEVEN YEARS AGO AND WHEN I

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:58.646
APPLIED IT WAS THOUSANDS AND

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:00.748
THOUSANDS MORE THAN THAT- SO IS

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:02.983
DRAMATICALLY CHANGED. SO WE HAD

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:05.352
TO RETHINK HOW WE RECRUIT AND

01:37:05.419 --> 01:37:07.888
HIRE. MEMBERS OF OUR DEPARTMENT

SO IN REGARDS TO RECRUITING. WE

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:11.158
DEVELOP THE DIVERSE RECRUITING

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:12.960
STRATEGY WITH THE NEW CAMPAIGN

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:15.229
THAT INCLUDED BILLBOARDS-

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:18.966
CAMPAIGN THAT- SPOKE TO- BEING

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:21.302

AND HE RECORDED A SONG TITLED

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:31.178
BE THE DIFFERENCE THAT WENT

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:34.215
NATIONWIDE. AND JUST COMPLETELY

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:36.350
CHANGED OUR RECRUITING CAMPAIGN

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:37.985
AND RECRUITING ON IVERSE RADIO

01:37:38.052 --> 01:37:40.888
STATIONS BILLBOARDS THINGS LIKE

01:37:40.955 --> 01:37:42.590
THAT. WE ALSO HAVE OVER THE

01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:43.824
LAST COUPLE YEARS PARTNERED

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:46.360
WITH SAC STATE TO CREATE A

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:48.629
PROGRAM AT SAC STATE THAT'S A

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:50.698
LACK OF GROW YOUR OWN PROGRAM

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:51.932
CALLED LAX LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:54.068

SOME OF OUR JUNIOR COLLEGES TO

01:37:57.304 --> 01:38:00.274
ATTRACT. PEOPLE IN COLLEGE TO

01:38:00.341 --> 01:38:01.408

IMPORTANT TO NOTE ONE OF THE

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:09.984
REQUIREMENTS. OF THEIR PROGRAMS

01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:11.452
IS IT CAN'T JUST BE THERE

01:38:11.518 --> 01:38:13.854
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SCHOOL. SO WE

01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:15.823
GET A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM OTHER

WAS KILLED AS ONE OF OUR POLICE

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:34.642
OFFICERS IN OUR CITY BUT SHE

PROGRAM AND HER DEGREE WAS

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:39.813
INJURED EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:40.881
DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S REALLY

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:43.017

INTERESTED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:48.956
WE HAVE ALSO IMPROVED SPEED. OF

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:50.124
THE HIRING PROCESS THROUGH

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:53.427
ONLINE- TEST TAKING AND

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:54.862
SPEEDING UP THE PROCESS THAT WE

01:38:54.928 --> 01:38:56.697
GET THE NAMES BECAUSE EVERYBODY

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:58.232
IS LOOKING FOR HIGHLY QUALIFIED

01:38:58.299 --> 01:38:59.867
CANDIDATES. AND WE DON'T WANT

01:38:59.933 --> 01:39:01.502
TO LOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY GET

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:04.905
STRUNG OUT IN THE PROCESS AND-IT TAKES TOO LONG. WE ALSO

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:06.573
CREATED ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.142
WHICH IS IT WHICH IS REALLY

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:09.009
WHAT WHERE I WANT TO SPEND THE

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:11.845
REST OF MY TIME ON. IS WE CAN

01:39:11.912 --> 01:39:13.247

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:16.250
TRADITIONALLY HAVE AND AS A

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:17.351
POLICE OFFICER POSITIONS

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:18.485
TYPICALLY IN THEIR MID

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:20.120
TWENTIES. THEY'RE JUST NOT

01:39:20.187 --> 01:39:20.888
APPLYING IN THOSE NUMBERS

01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:23.157
ANYMORE- AND WE STILL HAVE THE

01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:24.758
CHALLENGE OF GETTING PEOPLE

01:39:24.825 --> 01:39:25.526
FROM BACKGROUNDS THAT ARE

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:29.863

THE ENTRY LEVEL THAT WE USED TO

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:49.383
GET PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:50.184
AT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM THE

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:52.786

OFFICER DISPATCHER AND THOSE

01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:58.992
POSITIONS ARE WAY MORE DIVERSE.

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:00.994
THAN WHAT WE TYPICALLY HAVE IN

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:04.498

MISTER CHAIR SO I THINK THIS IS

01:55:28.554 --> 01:55:29.756
DIRECTLY THIS DROUGHT CON IN

01:55:29.822 --> 01:55:32.592
CHIEF HìNH. BUT AND THE CHIEF

01:55:32.659 --> 01:55:34.661
MENTIONED THAT IT'S FROM

01:55:34.727 --> 01:55:37.797
APPLICATION TO THE- ELIGIBILITY

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:39.532
HE LOSES ABOUT 90% OF

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:40.933
APPLICANTS I THINK THAT WAS THE

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.568
DATA THAT HE CITED. AND I'VE

01:55:42.635 --> 01:55:44.237
HEARD THAT BEFORE THAT MANY

01:55:44.304 --> 01:55:46.939
pMAKE IT TO ACADEMY I WANT TO

01:55:47.006 --> 01:55:48.207
TALK ABOUT THAT PIECE OF THE

01:55:48.274 --> 01:55:50.209
PUZZLE PEOPLE WHO ARE FLYING.

01:55:50.276 --> 01:55:53.246
BUT DON'T MAKE IT TO EVEN BE

01:55:53.313 --> 01:55:54.013
POTENTIALLY IN THE RANKS OF OUR

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.682
POLICE FORCES. I WANT

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:57.317
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE FACTORS

01:55:57.383 --> 01:56:00.653
ARE THAT DR 90% OF PEOPLE TO

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.288
NOT BE ELIGIBLE. ARE THOSE

01:56:02.355 --> 01:56:03.189
THINGS HAVING A DISPARATE

01:56:03.256 --> 01:56:04.590
IMPACT ON WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:06.893
COLOR. ARE SHOULD WE BE LOOKING

01:56:06.959 --> 01:56:08.628
AT THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TO

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:09.562
MAKE THOSE ELIGIBLE MORE

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:11.464
DIVERSE OUR LITTLE ALL OF

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:14.701
THOSE. THINGS CRITICAL TO A

01:56:14.767 --> 01:56:15.868
SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AND

01:56:15.935 --> 01:56:17.236
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE FORCE

01:56:17.303 --> 01:56:19.305
EVERYTHING'S. WE SHOULD HOLD ON

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:21.941
TO- AS MISS VICE ON MENTIONED

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:22.975
ARE THERE OTHER FACTORS WE

01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:23.976
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:26.012
SHOULD MAKE FOLKS INELIGIBLE TO

01:56:26.079 --> 01:56:27.213
MAKE IT TO THAT FINAL PHASE FOR

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.882
EXAMPLE- EXPERIENCE OR TIES TO

01:56:29.949 --> 01:56:32.185
WHITE SUPREMACY GROUPS SO. I

01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:33.219
PUT IT BACK TO YOU BUT I'D LIKE

01:56:33.286 --> 01:56:35.355
YOU TO SPEAK FURTHER ABOUT THAT

01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:40.893
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THANK YOU.

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:42.829
I COULD SPEAK UP AT THE THANK

01:56:42.895 --> 01:56:44.330
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I CAN

01:56:44.397 --> 01:56:45.965
SPEAK. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE MY

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:46.999
EXPERIENCE THE ONLY POLICE

01:56:47.066 --> 01:56:48.701
DEPARTMENT THE BIGGEST FACTOR I

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:50.436
THINK IN Y. CANDIDATES WILL

01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:52.238
WILL MAYBE DROP OFF DURING THE

01:56:52.305 --> 01:56:54.807
PROCESS IS A LARGE PART TIME.

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:56.576
THE TIME REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A

01:56:56.642 --> 01:56:58.311
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION AND GO

01:56:58.378 --> 01:56:59.779
THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT STEPS

01:56:59.846 --> 01:57:01.013
AND PROCESS THESE CAN BE VERY

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.815
LENGTHY. IT COULD BE A MATTER

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:05.418
OF YOU KNOW. TWO THREE MONTHS

01:57:05.485 --> 01:57:06.152
TO SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:07.920
DEPENDING ON. WHAT NEEDS TO BE

01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:09.822
DONE AND MANY PEOPLE JUST CAN'T

01:57:09.889 --> 01:57:11.858
WAIT THAT LONG FOR A JOB. I'M

01:57:11.924 --> 01:57:13.292
IN TERMS OF THE FACTORS THERE

01:57:13.359 --> 01:57:15.061
VARIETY OF FACTORS WHY PEOPLE

01:57:15.128 --> 01:57:16.796
MAY SCREEN OUT AND DEPARTMENTS

01:57:16.863 --> 01:57:17.997
HAVE GOTTEN BETTER AT MAKING

01:57:18.064 --> 01:57:19.565
SURE THEY MEET THE MINIMUM

01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:20.466
REQUIREMENTS BEFORE EVEN

01:57:20.533 --> 01:57:22.168
APPLYING. ONE BUT IT'S A VERY

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:24.103
RIGOROUS PROCESS IN TERMS OF

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:25.171
TESTING YOU KNOW LOOKING AT

01:57:25.238 --> 01:57:27.673
THEIR PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES-

01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.642
I'VE WRITTEN AND ORAL TASKS-

01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:31.477
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING WHICH

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:33.780
TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF TIME-

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:35.581
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS LOOKING

01:57:35.648 --> 01:57:36.983
AT SORT OF THOSE MINIMUM

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:39.352
OCCUPATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS. I

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:40.486
THINK THE ONE AREA THAT IS

01:57:40.553 --> 01:57:43.423
WORTHY OF EXPLORATION IN TERMS

01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:44.991
OF THE PROCESS IS DEPARTMENTS

01:57:45.057 --> 01:57:46.759
TO CONTINUE TO USE HOLOGRAPH

01:57:46.826 --> 01:57:49.762
EXAMINATION- THE POLYGRAPH. HAS

01:57:49.829 --> 01:57:51.764
ITS UTILITY BUT I'VE ALWAYS

01:57:51.831 --> 01:57:53.466
QUESTIONED IT BOTH AS WHEN I

01:57:53.533 --> 01:57:55.301
WAS A PROSECUTOR IN THE PROCESS

01:57:55.368 --> 01:57:57.036
NOW ABOUT ITS VALIDITY. THE

01:57:57.103 --> 01:57:59.705
SCIENTIFIC WAY. TO BE ABLE TO

01:57:59.772 --> 01:58:02.008
TRULY FIND DECEPTION. IT COULD

01:58:02.074 --> 01:58:03.409
BE USED AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE

01:58:03.476 --> 01:58:05.511
WILL CONFESS TO THINGS- BEFORE

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:07.713
THEY- I'M TO THE POLYGRAPH BUT

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:09.515
THE CHANCES OF FALSE POSITIVES

01:58:09.582 --> 01:58:11.417
AND FALSE NEGATIVES ARE ARE

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:13.886
STILL VERY HIGH. IN IT'S NOT

01:58:13.953 --> 01:58:15.788
THAT IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT A

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:17.623
USEFUL TOOL BUT I REALLY WANT

01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:18.491
TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME EFFORT

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:21.060
MONEY. WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:22.261
MORE THOROUGH BACKGROUND

01:58:22.328 --> 01:58:24.397
INVESTIGATIONS LOOKING AT-

01:58:24.464 --> 01:58:25.698
TALKING TO MORE SO SEE IT'S

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:26.966
LOOKING ESPECIALLY IF A

01:58:27.033 --> 01:58:29.302
CANDIDATE LIVES ELSEWHERE- IN

01:58:29.368 --> 01:58:30.837
THE VALUE OF THAT TO FIND THOSE

01:58:30.903 --> 01:58:32.605
ASSOCIATIONS THAT YOU. YOU

01:58:32.672 --> 01:58:38.945
ALLUDED. TO OF BIAS AND OTHER

01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:41.948
THINGS. THANK YOU VERY. BOB

01:58:42.014 --> 01:58:43.883
I'LL JUMP IN- YEAH THERE'S ALL

01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:44.984
SORTS OF RE WHY DON'T MAKE IT

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:47.954
THROUGH- BUT THE BIGGEST FACTOR

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:49.856
IS THE GROUPS THAT WE ARE LOW

01:58:49.922 --> 01:58:52.258
ON WHICH YOUR- TO BE MORE

01:58:52.325 --> 01:58:54.227
SPECIFIC IS AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:58:54.293 --> 01:58:56.829
HISPANIC WOMEN. IS STARTS FROM

01:58:56.896 --> 01:58:58.731
THE VERY BEGINNING WE HAVE VERY

01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:01.133
FEW OF THOSE GROUPS A PLOT- AND

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:03.269
SO PART OF IT IS HOW DO WE

01:59:03.336 --> 01:59:05.905
CHANGE THE PERCEPTION AND THOSE

01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:07.273
SORT OF THINGS AMONGST GROUPS

01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:09.408
THAT START OUT BEHIND BECAUSE

01:59:09.475 --> 01:59:11.577
THEY DON'T APPLY- BUT THERE'S

01:59:11.644 --> 01:59:12.745
ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY THEY

01:59:12.812 --> 01:59:14.046
GET KICKED OUT WITH THE

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:15.748
BACKGROUND IS A VERY EXTENSIVE.

01:59:15.815 --> 01:59:17.016
THEY'LL GO OT OF STATE IF

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:18.117
YOU'RE FROM OUT OF STATE THEY

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:19.952
TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS THEY GO

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:20.987
TO YOUR SCHOOLS THEY LOOK AT

01:59:21.053 --> 01:59:22.922
YOUR PERSONNEL FILE IF YOU'RE

01:59:22.989 --> 01:59:24.724
FROM ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OR EVEN

01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:26.225
APPLIED AT ANOTHER DEPARTMENT

01:59:26.292 --> 01:59:27.960
SO IF YOU'VE APPLIED FOR THREE

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:29.161
OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE

01:59:29.228 --> 01:59:30.263
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATORS GO

01:59:30.329 --> 01:59:31.664
LOOK AT YOUR BACKGROUND PACKET

01:59:31.731 --> 01:59:32.865
THOSE DEPARTMENTS AND IF YOU

01:59:32.932 --> 01:59:33.933
TOLD THEM SOMETHING YOU DON'T

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.636
TELL US THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM

01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:38.638
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT. SO THAT-

01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:40.907
I'LL JUST THE- A LITTLE BIT

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:42.808
IT'S A INVALUABLE TOOL SOME

01:59:42.875 --> 01:59:45.344
PEOPLE USE A VOICE. STRESS TEST

01:59:45.411 --> 01:59:47.446
WE USE A POLYGRAPH WE FOUND OUT

01:59:47.513 --> 01:59:48.447
A LOT OF THINGS TO THE

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:50.550
POLYGRAPH THAT. WE DIDN'T YOU

01:59:50.616 --> 01:59:52.018
DIDN'T TELL US. BEFORE THE

01:59:52.084 --> 01:59:53.686
POLYGRAPH SO IS CRITICAL PART

01:59:53.753 --> 01:59:55.655
OF THE PROCESS. I MEAN YOU GET

01:59:55.721 --> 01:59:57.757
OTHER CHANCES TO TAKE POLYGRAPH

01:59:57.823 --> 01:59:59.258
IF YOU DON'T PASS A QUESTION TO

01:59:59.325 --> 02:00:00.660
SEE IF WELL MAYBE JUST LEFT

02:00:00.726 --> 02:00:03.129
SOME OUTLETS WILL RECHECK IT.

02:00:03.195 --> 02:00:04.430
AND THEN SOME PEOPLE PASS AT

02:00:04.497 --> 02:00:06.198
THAT POINT. I'M BUT THE OTHER

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:08.534
THING AND- MANY ALVAREZ IS ON

02:00:08.601 --> 02:00:10.303
HERE SO HE AND I HAVE TALKED

02:00:10.369 --> 02:00:12.371
ABOUT THIS AND POST IS WORKING

02:00:12.438 --> 02:00:13.940
ON THIS. BUT THE OTHER THING

02:00:14.006 --> 02:00:16.008
THAT- IS CRITICAL IN THE HIRING

02:00:16.075 --> 02:00:18.444
PROCESS IS OBVIOUSLY. YOU DON'T

02:00:18.511 --> 02:00:19.278
MAKE IT THROUGH THE ACADEMY YOU

02:00:19.345 --> 02:00:20.880
GOT HIRED BUT- LIKE YOU'RE

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:21.614
STILL NOT AN OFFICER ON THE

02:00:21.681 --> 02:00:22.782
STREET BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MAKE

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:24.417
IT TO THE ACADEMY SO. TO ME

02:00:24.483 --> 02:00:24.984
THAT'S SORT OF PART OF THE

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:27.019
HIRING PROCESS. AND WHAT WE

02:00:27.086 --> 02:00:29.422
FOUND IN YEARS PAST THAT- LIKE

02:00:29.488 --> 02:00:32.124
THE TWO ACADEMIES PRIOR TO ME.

02:00:32.191 --> 02:00:33.659
BEING SWORN IN AS CHIEF HERE IN

02:00:33.726 --> 02:00:35.127
SACRAMENTO WE LOST AND I THINK

02:00:35.194 --> 02:00:36.662
IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTEEN

02:00:36.729 --> 02:00:37.863
OR EIGHTEEN PEOPLE WERE KICKED

02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:39.732
OUT OF. A TOTAL OF TWO

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:41.467
ACADEMIES. EVERY ONE OF THEM

02:00:41.534 --> 02:00:43.402
WAS DIVERSE. SO THE EVERY

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:44.437
SINGLE PERSON WE KICKED OUT WAS

02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:47.039
EITHER- RACIAL RACIALLY DIVERSE

02:00:47.106 --> 02:00:49.208
OR GENDER DIFFERS. IN EVERY

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:50.710
SINGLE ONE OF THEM WAS KICKED

02:00:50.776 --> 02:00:52.878
OUT FOR SHOOTING RANGE. OR

02:00:52.945 --> 02:00:55.348
DRIVING. TWO THINGS THAT I

02:00:55.414 --> 02:00:58.517
THINK ARE LEARNED- SKILLS SO WE

02:00:58.584 --> 02:01:00.019
DON'T WANT TO LOWER THE

02:01:00.086 --> 02:01:02.421
STANDARDS- BECAUSE YOU NEED TO

02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:03.656
KNOW HOW TO DRIVE AND YOU NEED

02:01:03.723 --> 02:01:06.859
TO KNOW- THE RANGE. BUT TO ME

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:08.227
PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY CAN LEARN

02:01:08.294 --> 02:01:09.996
THOSE SKILLS BUT WE DON'T ALL

02:01:10.062 --> 02:01:11.097
START AT THE SAME SPOT FOR

02:01:11.163 --> 02:01:12.732
EXAMPLE. WHEN I WAS IN THE

02:01:12.798 --> 02:01:14.200
ACADEMY I WAS NINETEEN YEARS

02:01:14.266 --> 02:01:15.201
OLD I'VE NEVER TOUCHED A GUN

02:01:15.267 --> 02:01:17.503
BEFORE. MY ROOMMATE WAS FIFTY

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:19.305
THREE YEARS OLD AND- JUST SPENT

02:01:19.372 --> 02:01:20.840
THIRTY YEARS IN THE MILITARY. I

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.875
THINK YOU CAN JUST HAVE CLASS

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:23.609
TOMORROW WE'RE GONNA BE OF THE

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:25.945
SAME SPOT. I MEAN I'M LEARNING

02:01:26.012 --> 02:01:27.513
HOW TO PUT THE MAGAZINE IN THE

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:29.682
GUN AND HE CAN SHOOT IT THROUGH

02:01:29.749 --> 02:01:31.250
A ONE INCH HOLE OR THIRTY

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:33.252
ROUNDS. IN SO IT MIGHT TAKE ME

02:01:33.319 --> 02:01:34.820
A MONTH TO GET THAT SKILL

02:01:34.887 --> 02:01:39.225
WHERE'S HE. STARTS OUT WITH

02:01:39.291 --> 02:01:39.992
THAT SKILL. BUT THE RULES

02:01:40.059 --> 02:01:41.160
ALWAYS HAD S. THIS IS. ACT THE

02:01:41.227 --> 02:01:42.495
SAME. LIKE I HAVE LEARN IT IN A

02:01:42.561 --> 02:01:43.729
CERTAIN OF TIME. SO ONE WE'RE

02:01:43.796 --> 02:01:44.697
WORKING ON A LOT OF THOSE

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:46.632
THINGS WITH POST. BUT THE OTHER

02:01:46.699 --> 02:01:47.967
THING WE DID IS INSTEAD IT

02:01:48.034 --> 02:01:49.335
WOULD BE FOR THE SIX MONTH

02:01:49.402 --> 02:01:50.536
ACADEMY WE NOW HAVE A PRE

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:52.304
ACADEMY. OR WE PUT ALL OUR

02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:54.206
PEOPLE THROUGH A MONTH TO A

02:01:54.273 --> 02:01:55.341
MONTH AND A HALF OF A PRE

02:01:55.408 --> 02:01:57.376
ACADEMY. WHERE IT'S HEAVY ON

02:01:57.443 --> 02:01:59.278
RANGE AND DRIVING AND WE HAVE

02:01:59.345 --> 02:02:01.247
KICKED VERY FEW PEOPLE OUT OF

02:02:01.313 --> 02:02:02.181
THE ACADEMY DUE TO THOSE

02:02:02.248 --> 02:02:04.417
THINGS. BUT PRIOR TO THAT WE

02:02:04.483 --> 02:02:05.584
WERE LOOSE THE THAT LITTLE BIT

02:02:05.651 --> 02:02:06.886
OF DIVERSITY THAT WE WERE

02:02:06.952 --> 02:02:08.487
GETTING AT THAT TIME. BEFORE

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:09.855
WE'VE REVAMPED OUR RECRUITING

02:02:09.922 --> 02:02:11.190
AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS

02:02:11.257 --> 02:02:12.958
AFFECT STATE THAT WE'VE DONE-

02:02:13.025 --> 02:02:14.527
THE LITTLE BIT THAT WE RECRUIT.

02:02:14.593 --> 02:02:16.862
AT WHERE WE'RE HIRING A LOT OF

02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:17.830
IT WE WERE KICKING OUT AN

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.331
ACADEMY FOR THOSE TWO ISSUES

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:20.866
AND THAT HAS BEEN SOLVED SO.

02:02:20.933 --> 02:02:21.600
SOME OF THESE THINGS YOU JUST

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:22.968
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PROCESS AND

02:02:23.035 --> 02:02:26.072
SEE IF THERE'S SOME OTHER WAY

02:02:26.138 --> 02:02:26.639
WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS. AND

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:28.741
THAT'S WHAT WE GET. THANK YOU

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:30.009
CAN I ASK ONE FOLLOW UP

02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:32.745
QUESTION MISTER CHAIR. SURE OF

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:34.847
HIS BRIEF YES OKAY THANKS- SO

THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT

02:02:36.182 --> 02:02:37.783
THAT WAS- HELPFUL INFORMATION

02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:39.251
BOTH OF YOU AND I THINK IT

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:40.319
REALLY SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT

02:02:40.386 --> 02:02:41.387
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CULTURE

02:02:41.454 --> 02:02:43.122
OF POLICING SO THAT MORE PEOPLE

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:44.290
OF COLOR AND WOMEN WANT TO JOIN

02:02:44.356 --> 02:02:45.558
THE RANKS FROM THE GET GO AND

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:47.126
LOCAL EYES CHIU HUNT POINTED

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:49.929
AT. MY LAST QUESTION IS- DEBTS

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:52.598
WHAT ROLE DOES THAT PLAY IN-

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:56.702
THAT BACKGROUND IN HOW DOES

02:02:56.769 --> 02:03:00.172
ITEM AND IS ESSENTIALLY

02:03:00.239 --> 02:03:01.140
DISPROPORTIONATE. THANK YOU.

02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:02.675
YEAH I'LL I'LL- DO THAT

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:05.778
EVERYTHING IS- LOOKED AT

02:03:05.845 --> 02:03:07.980
COLLECTIVELY SO MEANING THAT

02:03:08.047 --> 02:03:09.315
ISN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL BUT IF

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:10.616
YOU HAVE EVERY SINGLE COUNT

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:12.284
YOU'VE HAD OVER THE LAST TEN

02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:13.986
YEARS. IN COLLECTIONS. AND THAT

02:03:14.053 --> 02:03:15.521
SHOWS IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

02:03:15.588 --> 02:03:16.489
AND THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE A

02:03:16.555 --> 02:03:18.090
PROBLEM. BUT EVEN IF YOU HAD

02:03:18.157 --> 02:03:19.558
COLLECTIONS FIVE YEARS AGO

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:20.793
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT YOU

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:22.928
HAVE IN YOUR PAST. IF YOU HAVE.

02:03:22.995 --> 02:03:24.697
A TRACK RECORD AFTER THAT THAT

02:03:24.764 --> 02:03:26.098
MEANS OKAY YOU LEARN FROM THOSE

02:03:26.165 --> 02:03:27.767
MISTAKES THAT YOU MADE. AND NOW

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:28.934
YOU'RE MAKING GOOD DECISIONS

02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:30.202
THEN YOU'RE FINE SO DEBT ITSELF

02:03:30.269 --> 02:03:31.604
DOESN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING.

02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:32.772
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING YOUR

02:03:32.838 --> 02:03:34.573
BILLS IF YOU AREN'T COLLECTIONS

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:38.043
IF YOU HAD DONE FOR COMPUTERS.

02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:41.013
THOSE SORT OF THINGS DO MATTER.

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:43.215
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH-

02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:45.217

MCCARTY AND THEN MAYES RUBIO

02:03:52.892 --> 02:03:53.425

ISSUES IDENTIFYING THEM AND

02:04:15.414 --> 02:04:17.249
THEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:04:17.316 --> 02:04:19.485
WE ADDRESS THEM. OF THIS BASED

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:22.621
ON I APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENT

02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:24.757
THAT THE COMMUNITY THAT IS MOST

02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:27.393
IMPACTED SHOULD LEAD THE

02:04:27.459 --> 02:04:29.728
DISCUSSION- MY QUESTION TO YOU

02:04:29.795 --> 02:04:31.597

02:04:31.664 --> 02:04:33.132

AND COMMUNITY LEADING IN THE

02:05:07.499 --> 02:05:09.869
MOST IMPACTED LEADING I THINK

02:05:09.935 --> 02:05:10.636
THAT WE NEED INPUT FROM THE

02:05:10.703 --> 02:05:12.905
COMMUNITY WE NEED- WE NEED

02:05:12.972 --> 02:05:14.473
SPACES WHERE COMMUNITY CAN GIVE

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.075
SUGGESTIONS WE NEED THE PEOPLE

02:05:16.141 --> 02:05:18.611
THAT ARE THE MOST IMPACTED. TO

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:19.311
TELL YOU THEIR EXPERIENCES SO

02:05:19.378 --> 02:05:21.447
THAT OUR LEGISLATORS CAN MAKE

02:05:21.513 --> 02:05:22.748
DECISIONS THAT ARE BASED ON

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:25.384
THOSE EXPERIENCES- WE HAVE I'VE

02:05:25.451 --> 02:05:26.352
I WORK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

02:05:26.418 --> 02:05:27.653
COMMUNITY AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.421
COMMONALITIES IN OUR

02:05:29.488 --> 02:05:31.523
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF

02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:33.993
COLOR. AND AS LONG AS THOSE

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:35.628
THINGS CONTINUE TO HAPPEN THEN

02:05:35.694 --> 02:05:37.029
THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:38.063
ADDRESSED AND IF WE'RE NOT

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:40.165
HEARING. HOW YOU KNOW A

02:05:40.232 --> 02:05:40.933
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS BEEN

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.269
PULLED OVER TWICE. AND HAD GUNS

02:05:43.335 --> 02:05:44.670
DRAWN ON HIM BY POLICE WHEN HE

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:45.404
HASN'T BEEN DOING ANYTHING

02:05:45.471 --> 02:05:46.939
WRONG IF YOU'RE NOT HEARING THE

02:05:47.006 --> 02:05:48.774
STORIES THEN. YOU DON'T KNOW

02:05:48.841 --> 02:05:49.475
THEY'RE HAPPENING IN THE

02:05:49.541 --> 02:05:51.543
EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE EARLIER. I

02:05:51.610 --> 02:05:52.678
SAW THE EXPRESSIONS OF SOME OF

02:05:52.745 --> 02:05:53.612
THE FOLKS IN HERE WHEN THEY

02:05:53.679 --> 02:05:55.281
HEARD YOU KNOW THE EXAMPLES OF

02:05:55.347 --> 02:05:56.382
WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED WELL

02:05:56.448 --> 02:05:57.983
WE'VE BEEN DOING ACTIVIST WORK

02:05:58.050 --> 02:05:59.985
IN THE STREETS. AND THEY WERE

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:01.720
SURPRISED TO EVEN HEAR THAT A

02:06:01.787 --> 02:06:02.922
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOY GOT SHOT

02:06:02.988 --> 02:06:04.957
WITH A RUBBER BULLET WHILE AT A

02:06:05.024 --> 02:06:08.661
PROTEST BY A POLICE OFFICER. SO

02:06:08.727 --> 02:06:10.362
I THINK BASICALLY IT ALL BOILS

02:06:10.429 --> 02:06:12.698
DOWN TO LISTENING TO. THE

02:06:12.765 --> 02:06:13.966
COMMUNITY AND THEIR EXPERIENCES

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:15.834
AND THEN. CREATING LEGISLATION

02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:17.002
AROUND THOSE EXPERIENCES AND

02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:18.671
SEEING THE COMMONALITIES IN ALL

02:06:18.737 --> 02:06:21.774
OF THESE EXPERIENCES. WHILE

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.776
YOU'RE- YES AND WHILE YOU'RE

02:06:23.842 --> 02:06:24.610
THERE ONE OTHER QUESTION A

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:26.545
FOLLOW UP YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT

02:06:26.612 --> 02:06:29.682
THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR-

02:06:29.748 --> 02:06:31.016
ABOUT BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:06:31.083 --> 02:06:32.985
SPECIALLY POLICE CHIEFS AND

02:06:33.052 --> 02:06:35.688
SHERIFFS AND OUR ELECTED. DO

02:06:35.754 --> 02:06:38.757
YOU SEE A PARTICULAR WAY TO-

02:06:38.824 --> 02:06:39.992
AND LET WEATHER LET THAT

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:42.127
THROUGH LEGISLATION OR THROUGH

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:45.197
RULES OF- PROMULGATED AT THE

02:06:45.264 --> 02:06:47.366
COUNTY OR THE CITY LEVEL THAT

02:06:47.433 --> 02:06:49.969
WOULD ASSIST IN. SEPARATING

02:06:50.035 --> 02:06:53.072
THESE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAW

02:06:53.138 --> 02:06:57.543
ENFORCEMENT- CHIEFS AND

02:06:57.609 --> 02:06:59.678
SHERIFFS AND ELECTIVES. SO I AM

02:06:59.745 --> 02:07:02.548
NOT AN EXPERT ON LEGISLATION-

02:07:02.614 --> 02:07:04.283
SO I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE

02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:05.951
GREAT FOR LEGISLATORS TO GET

02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:08.420
CREATIVE IN THAT AREA- I JUST

02:07:08.487 --> 02:07:10.489
WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO MENTION

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:12.057
THAT THESE ARE REALLY BIG.

02:07:12.124 --> 02:07:13.792
OBSTACLES IN COMMUNITY RIGHT

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:15.894
NOW. AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:20.065
SACRAMENTO IN PARTICULAR- ARE.

02:07:20.132 --> 02:07:22.468
OUR SHERIFF HAS A VERY STRONG

02:07:22.534 --> 02:07:23.102
ANTI POLLUTION SHOULD WITH OUR

02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:25.304
DISTRICT ATTORNEY. AND AS A

02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:27.373
RESULT HER RECORD OUR DISTRICT

02:07:27.439 --> 02:07:28.741
ATTORNEY'S RECORD HAS NEVER

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:32.578
SERVE THE PEOPLE- ALSO YOU KNOW

02:07:32.644 --> 02:07:34.947
OUR POLICE CHIEF AND OUR MAYOR

02:07:35.014 --> 02:07:38.317
AND OUR- OUR- CITY MANAGER THEY

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:39.785
ALL HAVE A VERY. GOOD

02:07:39.852 --> 02:07:41.720
RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER WE

02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:43.088
OFTEN SEE THE CITY MANAGER

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:44.156
INTERMINGLING WITH DIFFERENT

02:07:44.223 --> 02:07:46.158
POLICE OFFICERS YOU KNOW WHILE

02:07:46.225 --> 02:07:48.293
HE'S OUT DOING HIS WORK. AND

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.895
YOU KNOW THERE ARE CASUAL

02:07:49.962 --> 02:07:52.664
CONVERSATIONS I'VE SEEN OUR

02:07:52.731 --> 02:07:54.733
COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE BACKDOOR

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:55.734
YOU KNOW COME OUT OF A ROOM

02:07:55.801 --> 02:07:58.003
WITH OUR- THE SACRAMENTO

02:07:58.070 --> 02:08:02.307
POLICE. OFFICERS ASSOCIATION- I

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:03.642
WANT TO SAY IS TITLES EXECUTIVE

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:05.010
DIRECTOR'S NAME IS TIM DAVIS

02:08:05.077 --> 02:08:06.178
I'VESEEN THEM COME OUT A ROOMS

02:08:06.245 --> 02:08:07.780
PETTING EACH OTHER'S BACKS AND

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:08.614
I THINK ALL OF THAT IS

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:09.681
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:08:09.748 --> 02:08:10.783
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

02:08:10.849 --> 02:08:12.351
EACH OTHER. AND AS A RESULT

02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:13.252
THEY'RE BEHOLDEN TO EACH OTHER

02:08:13.318 --> 02:08:14.186
AND THEY'RE NOT BUILDING

02:08:14.253 --> 02:08:15.387
RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:16.288
AND FINDING OUT WHAT'S

02:08:16.355 --> 02:08:18.490
HAPPENING TO COMMUNITY- I JUST

02:08:18.557 --> 02:08:19.725
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:20.859
KEEP ALL THAT IN MIND WHILE

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:21.827
MAKING LEGISLATION BUT I

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:24.296

YEARS OF AGE. AND RESEARCH HAS

02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:00.505
SHOWN AS WE SAID EARLIER. THAT

02:13:00.572 --> 02:13:02.341
PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER AND HAVE

02:13:02.407 --> 02:13:04.543
MORE EDUCATION. HAVE BETTER

02:13:04.609 --> 02:13:07.346

REQUIREMENT A. STATE WIDE

02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:20.425
STANDARD- THOSE ARE MY FIRST

02:13:20.492 --> 02:13:22.794
QUESTIONS THANK YOU. CHIEF OR

02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:27.699
WHOEVER WANTS TO RESPOND. I

GUESS I'LL GO FIRST- SO YEAH I

02:13:30.335 --> 02:13:31.970
THINK THAT ANY SIGNIFICANT

02:13:32.037 --> 02:13:34.239
CHANGE IN WHETHER IT'S AGE

02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:36.541
REQUIREMENT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

02:13:36.608 --> 02:13:37.776
TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD IF THAT

02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:39.845
WAS TO MOVE TO SAY TWENTY FIVE

02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:41.980
AND SWITCH FROM HAVING A HIGH

02:13:42.047 --> 02:13:43.582
SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR GED TO A

02:13:43.648 --> 02:13:45.150
BACHELOR'S DEGREE WHICH WHAT IT

02:13:45.217 --> 02:13:46.818
WOULD BE FOR MOST DEPARTMENTS.

02:13:46.885 --> 02:13:48.887
OURS WE LIKE I SAID WE REQUIRE

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:50.555
TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE I THINK

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:52.290
WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:53.859
AND SO WE NEED TO BE VERY

02:13:53.925 --> 02:13:56.194
CAREFUL WITH THAT- NO LIKE I

02:13:56.261 --> 02:13:57.362
SAID I START AT NINETEEN YEARS

02:13:57.429 --> 02:13:59.097
OLD AND NOW I'VE DONE THIRTY

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:00.132
THREE YEARS AND I'M THE POLICE

02:14:00.198 --> 02:14:02.033
CHIEF CHAU. IF I WAS REQUIRED

02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:04.836
TO BE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND

02:14:04.903 --> 02:14:05.370
HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE I

02:14:05.437 --> 02:14:06.505
WOULD NEVER. AND IT WILL

02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:07.873
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT

02:14:07.939 --> 02:14:09.741
GROUPS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

02:14:09.808 --> 02:14:11.943
RECRUIT BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING

02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:12.878
TO GET THEM AT A VERY EARLY

02:14:12.944 --> 02:14:15.447
AGE. IN JOBS THAT MANY OF THE

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:17.315
LIKE THIS- SOME OF THOSE JOBS

02:14:17.382 --> 02:14:18.316
LIKE STUDENT TRAINEE THEY'RE

02:14:18.383 --> 02:14:19.918
REQUIRED TO GO TO COLLEGE TO

02:14:19.985 --> 02:14:21.753
MAINTAIN THE JOB. SO I THINK

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.855
THE EDUCATION WISE- I REALLY

02:14:23.922 --> 02:14:25.023
LIKE WHERE WE'RE AT WITH TWO

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:26.425
YEARS OF COLLEGE I DO THINK

02:14:26.491 --> 02:14:27.959
EDUCATION MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:28.994
BUT YOU SEE MOST OF OUR

02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:32.297
OFFICERS ESPECIALLY ONCE HIRED

02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:33.932
IN THE LAST TEN FIFTEEN YEARS.

02:14:33.999 --> 02:14:34.800
VAST MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE

02:14:34.866 --> 02:14:36.101
BACHELOR'S DEGREES THAT DOESN'T

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:37.035
MEAN THEY STARTED WITH A

INCENTIVE PAY. FOR BACHELOR'S

02:14:41.006 --> 02:14:42.307
DEGREES SO THERE'S OTHER WAYS

02:14:42.374 --> 02:14:43.542
TO GET TO THE EDUCATIONAL

02:14:43.608 --> 02:14:45.177
REQUIREMENT THAT MIGHT WORK

02:14:45.243 --> 02:14:47.045
BETTER. IN THIS PROFESSION AND

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:49.648
FOR US YOU GET- MORE PAY IF YOU

02:14:49.714 --> 02:14:50.949
HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE SO.

02:14:51.016 --> 02:14:52.050
YOU MIGHT NOT START WITH ONE

02:14:52.117 --> 02:14:54.553
BUT THEN YOU'LL GET ONE TO. ONE

YOU. YOU NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE

02:24:55.453 --> 02:24:57.055

02:25:12.503 --> 02:25:15.506
ISSUES THAT- THAT ARE WITHIN

02:25:15.573 --> 02:25:18.810
THOSE COMMUNITIES I. HAVE ABOUT

PROMOTIONS. SO I'VE HAD THOSE

02:26:05.089 --> 02:26:07.125

ACADEMY ONE WE'VE SOLVED A LOT

02:33:13.584 --> 02:33:14.585

THROUGH THE WHOLE COUNTY THEY

02:33:24.695 --> 02:33:26.263
PASS ALL THE TRAINING. BUT FOR

02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:27.698
WHATEVER REASON WE DON'T THINK

02:33:27.765 --> 02:33:28.499
THEY'RE QUITE READY TO BE A

02:33:28.566 --> 02:33:30.167

THEY GET MORE EXPERIENCE. AND

02:33:34.138 --> 02:33:35.339
THEN WHEN THEY GET TO THE POINT

02:33:35.406 --> 02:33:36.674
WHERE WE THINK THEY CAN HANDLE

02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:38.108
THE RIGORS OF BEING A POLICE

02:33:38.175 --> 02:33:39.710
OFFICER THEN WE UPGRADE THEM TO

02:33:39.777 --> 02:33:41.312
PLACE ALSO. YES THERE'S MANY

02:33:41.378 --> 02:33:43.213
WAYS WE DO THAT WHETHER THERE'S

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:44.949
SOMEBODY THAT HAS SOME ISSUES.

02:33:45.015 --> 02:33:46.784
THAT WE THINK HAVE POTENTIAL OR

02:33:46.850 --> 02:33:48.085
SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT PASSED THE

02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:53.157
TEST. WE CAN PUT THEM BACK. IN

02:33:53.223 --> 02:33:53.757
THE KASHMIR GIVE THEM ANOTHER

02:33:53.824 --> 02:33:55.693
JOB. IF I COULD JUST ADD ON. IS

02:33:55.759 --> 02:33:57.361
ONE PROGRAM. THAT DEALS. WITH I

02:33:57.428 --> 02:33:59.797
THINK THE- PART OF QUESTION.

02:33:59.863 --> 02:34:01.398
WHICH IS- AN LAPD IT'S KNOWN AS

02:34:01.465 --> 02:34:02.666
THE POLICE OFFICER PREPARATION

02:34:02.733 --> 02:34:04.401
PROGRAM. WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY

02:34:04.468 --> 02:34:05.970
DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THE GAP

02:34:06.036 --> 02:34:07.571
BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE AGE

02:34:07.638 --> 02:34:09.974
OF- THE MINIMUM AGE TO COME A

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:11.609
POLICE OFFICER OR WHAT IT IS A

02:34:11.675 --> 02:34:13.744
PROGRAM- IN CONJECTURE THE

02:34:13.811 --> 02:34:14.945
COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE THEY

02:34:15.012 --> 02:34:16.847
ACTUALLY OBTAIN A- AN

02:34:16.914 --> 02:34:18.682
ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE. AND THEY

02:34:18.749 --> 02:34:21.218
ALSO LEARN ABOUT POLICING AND

02:34:21.285 --> 02:34:22.219
IT'S A IT'S A WAY TO BRIDGE

02:34:22.286 --> 02:34:23.854
THAT GAP. PROVIDED AN

02:34:23.921 --> 02:34:26.190
OPPORTUNITY FOR EDUCATION IT'S

02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:28.792
LARGELY- WITH STUDENTS WHO WERE

02:34:28.859 --> 02:34:30.294
FROM MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND

02:34:30.361 --> 02:34:32.029
IT'S A WAY TO GET THEM INTO

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:32.663
POLICING WHETHER IT'S WITH THE

02:34:32.730 --> 02:34:34.632
ONLY. OTHER AGENCIES AND I

02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:36.467
THINK THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE

02:34:36.533 --> 02:34:37.935
KEY TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T

02:34:38.002 --> 02:34:39.770
HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT IN ANY

02:34:39.837 --> 02:34:41.438
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IMPOSED

02:34:41.505 --> 02:34:42.439
IS THAT PROVIDE THE

02:34:42.506 --> 02:34:44.742
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE. AND

02:34:44.808 --> 02:34:46.543
HAVE A PATHWAY TO AN EDUCATION

02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:48.479
AND TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. JUST AS

02:34:48.545 --> 02:34:50.447
THE MILITARY DOES JUST AS MANY

02:34:50.514 --> 02:34:51.749
AGENCIES ON THEIR OWN HAVE

02:34:51.815 --> 02:34:53.817
DONE. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT

02:34:53.884 --> 02:34:54.918
SHOULD BE SOMETHING ON A

02:34:54.985 --> 02:34:56.854
STATEWIDE BASIS BECAUSE RIGHT

02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:58.489
NOW WE RELY ON THE FORWARD

02:34:58.555 --> 02:35:00.357
LOOKING LEADERSHIP OF CHIEF HAN

02:35:00.424 --> 02:35:02.126
AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS. TO TAKE

02:35:02.192 --> 02:35:03.227
IT UPON THEMSELVES TO MAKE

02:35:03.293 --> 02:35:05.129
THESE REQUIREMENTS AND YOU END

02:35:05.195 --> 02:35:06.864

DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITH

DIFFERENT STANDARDS DIFFERENT

REQUIREMENTS. AND IF WE TRULY

US IN MAKING BETTER POLICE

02:35:13.937 --> 02:35:15.205

02:45:36.026 --> 02:45:37.093
EXPERIENCE INHIGH SCHOOL MY

HE THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE

COLLEGE AND ENCOURAGED ME TO DO

02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:48.772
R. O. P. INSTEAD. AND SAID THAT

02:45:48.838 --> 02:45:50.240
YOU KNOW HE USED THE FACT THAT

02:45:50.307 --> 02:45:51.875
IT BE QUICKER TO GET THROUGH IT

02:45:51.941 --> 02:45:54.010
AND YOU KNOW SO FORTH AND SO

02:45:54.077 --> 02:45:57.213
ON. AND THAT CREATED- ME HAVING-TO GO TO JUNIOR COLLEGE AND

02:45:57.280 --> 02:45:58.615
START FROM THE LOWER LEVEL

02:45:58.682 --> 02:46:00.283
CLASSES TO GET THROUGH TO EVEN

02:46:00.350 --> 02:46:02.018
START TAKING COLLEGE REQUIRED

02:46:02.085 --> 02:46:05.755
CLASSES- SO THAT EXPERIENCE. IS

02:46:05.822 --> 02:46:07.624
COMMON IT'S NOT UNCOMMON SO I

02:46:07.691 --> 02:46:09.192
WANTED TO SAY ALSO THAT I AGREE

02:46:09.259 --> 02:46:10.860
THAT I AM IT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:46:10.927 --> 02:46:12.128
BOTHERING TO HEAR ABOUT AN

02:46:12.195 --> 02:46:14.764
EDUCATION REQUIREMENT- I'M SAD

02:46:14.831 --> 02:46:16.232
THAT MCCARTY LEAVING BECAUSE

02:46:16.299 --> 02:46:16.800
I'M GOING TO REFERENCE HIS

02:46:16.866 --> 02:46:19.703
STATEMENT AS WELL- BUT- I DON'T

02:46:19.769 --> 02:46:20.537
THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE

02:46:20.603 --> 02:46:22.072
CENTERED AROUND EDUCATION JUST

02:46:22.138 --> 02:46:24.407
BECAUSE IT DOES. DISENFRANCHISE

02:46:24.474 --> 02:46:25.308
A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT ALSO IT

02:46:25.375 --> 02:46:26.776
DOES ANOTHER THING IT THE FOLKS

02:46:26.843 --> 02:46:28.645
THAT ARE NOT IN OUR COMMUNITY

02:46:28.712 --> 02:46:29.446
THAT ARE DETACHED ALREADY FROM

02:46:29.512 --> 02:46:30.847
OUR COMMUNITIES. PUTTING THEM

02:46:30.914 --> 02:46:32.215
INTO A COLLEGE AND GIVING THEM

02:46:32.282 --> 02:46:33.650
COLLEGE LEVEL CLASSES IS GOING

02:46:33.717 --> 02:46:34.451
TO FURTHER DO YOU CATCH THEM

02:46:34.517 --> 02:46:35.585
FROM THE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T

02:46:35.652 --> 02:46:37.387
HAVE THOSE EXPERIENCES. SO

02:46:37.454 --> 02:46:38.755
THOSE ARE TWO WAYS I FEEL THAT

02:46:38.822 --> 02:46:40.623
IT HARMS BUT EVEN IF WE DO LOOK

02:46:40.690 --> 02:46:41.791
AT EDUCATION AND IT DOES BECOME

02:46:41.858 --> 02:46:44.160
IMPLEMENTED. WHAT MCCARTY SAID

02:46:44.227 --> 02:46:45.729
IS TAKING COLLEGE COURSES ARE

02:46:45.795 --> 02:46:47.897
HAVING TO GREASE THAT ARE IN-

02:46:47.964 --> 02:46:49.399
STUDIES THAT ARE EITHER SOCIAL

02:46:49.466 --> 02:46:51.434
SCIENCE STUDIES OR STUDIES THAT

02:46:51.501 --> 02:46:53.136
TEACH PEOPLE TO TEACH YOU HOW

02:46:53.203 --> 02:46:54.337
TO LEARN ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN

02:46:54.404 --> 02:46:56.673
AND- HUMAN- ACTIONS. THAT WOULD

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:58.174
BE ENCOURAGED YOU KNOW MAYBE

02:46:58.241 --> 02:47:00.143
WHILE SOMEBODY IS ALSO BEING A

02:47:00.210 --> 02:47:01.745
POLICE OFFICER GIVING THEM THE

02:47:01.811 --> 02:47:03.813
OPPORTUNITY TO- GIVEN AN

02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:05.648
OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY BE

02:47:05.715 --> 02:47:06.216
EDUCATED IN PAYING FOR THEIR

02:47:06.282 --> 02:47:08.518
EDUCATION- THAT'S THAT'S ALWAYS

02:47:08.585 --> 02:47:10.387
A PLUS IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY SO.

02:47:10.453 --> 02:47:12.021
THAT'S GOOD BUT I ALSO WANT TO

02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:13.456
LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE'RE

02:47:13.523 --> 02:47:14.657
TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION WE'RE

02:47:14.724 --> 02:47:16.626
TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY AND

02:47:16.693 --> 02:47:20.096
WITH BOTH OF THOSE THINGS IN

02:47:20.163 --> 02:47:20.663
PLACE EVEN IF WE CREATE THE

02:47:20.730 --> 02:47:21.664
BEST. YOU KNOW REFORM TO.

02:47:21.731 --> 02:47:23.166
REQUIRE THAT THESE THINGS TAKE

02:47:23.233 --> 02:47:24.734
PLACE. THERE'S STILL A POLICE

02:47:24.801 --> 02:47:26.970
CULTURE. THAT IS PROBLEMATIC

02:47:27.036 --> 02:47:28.772
AND SO YOU CAN GET. ALL THE

02:47:28.838 --> 02:47:30.340
DIVERSITY THAT YOU WANT INTO A

02:47:30.407 --> 02:47:31.841
POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND YOU CAN

02:47:31.908 --> 02:47:33.076
EDUCATE PEOPLE AS MUCH AS YOU

02:47:33.143 --> 02:47:34.644
WANT TO BUT IT COULD ALSO BUILD

02:47:34.711 --> 02:47:36.579
SOMETHING. REALLY BAD IF YOU

02:47:36.646 --> 02:47:38.348
HAVE A CULTURE OF POLICING.

02:47:38.415 --> 02:47:39.082
THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN

02:47:39.149 --> 02:47:40.483
PROBLEMATIC PROBLEMATIC AND

02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:42.452
EGOTISTICAL. SO I JUST WANTED

02:47:42.519 --> 02:47:44.120

BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION.

03:06:07.556 --> 03:06:08.323
THAT I'VE HEARD AND I'VE BEEN

03:06:08.390 --> 03:06:10.259
TAKING NOTES- AND THERE'S A FEW

03:06:10.325 --> 03:06:12.594
THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO

03:06:12.661 --> 03:06:13.328
ADDRESS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK

03:06:13.395 --> 03:06:16.431
YOU. FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR

03:06:16.498 --> 03:06:19.902
UNDERSTANDING BEING NOT ONLY A

03:06:19.968 --> 03:06:23.772
MINORITY BUT ALSO A WOMAN- SO.

03:06:23.839 --> 03:06:25.741
ONE OF THE THINGS A HERE IS

03:06:25.807 --> 03:06:26.241
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:06:26.308 --> 03:06:28.410
TRAINING- ANDTHERE ARE FEW

03:06:28.477 --> 03:06:30.612
THINGS THAT OFTENTIMES IN THE

03:06:30.679 --> 03:06:32.180
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE

03:06:32.247 --> 03:06:35.217
TALK ABOUT AROUND TRAINING- DE

03:06:35.284 --> 03:06:36.285
ESCALATION IS ONE OF THOSE

03:06:36.351 --> 03:06:38.487
THINGS- FROM THE AFRICAN

03:06:38.554 --> 03:06:40.322
AMERICAN COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE

03:06:40.389 --> 03:06:41.990
WE OFTENTIMES DO NOT THINK THAT

03:06:42.057 --> 03:06:44.226
TRAINING IS NECESSARILY AN

03:06:44.293 --> 03:06:45.394
ISSUE NOW TO SPEAK FOR THE

03:06:45.460 --> 03:06:46.762
WHOLE COMMUNITY BUT I SPEAK

03:06:46.828 --> 03:06:48.797
JUST FOR A SELECT FEW MEMBERS

03:06:48.864 --> 03:06:50.065
OF THE COMMUNITY AND WHY I SAY

03:06:50.132 --> 03:06:51.266
THAT IS BECASE WHEN WE TALK

03:06:51.333 --> 03:06:52.401
ABOUT VERY SPECIFICALLY DE

03:06:52.467 --> 03:06:55.203
ESCALATION TACTICS. OR TRAINING

03:06:55.270 --> 03:06:57.573
WE NOTICED THAT WHEN IT COMES

03:06:57.639 --> 03:06:59.174
TO KILLINGS OR EXCESSIVE USE OF

03:06:59.241 --> 03:07:00.709
FORCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT

03:07:00.776 --> 03:07:02.711
IT IS ALWAYS THE CONVERSATION

03:07:02.778 --> 03:07:04.179
COMES ABOUT TRAINING HOWEVER

03:07:04.246 --> 03:07:05.480
WHEN IS A NON WHITE SHOOTER

03:07:05.547 --> 03:07:07.115
THAT HAS GONE INTO A SCHOOL OR

03:07:07.182 --> 03:07:09.151
INTO A CHURCH AND WE KNOW THAT

03:07:09.217 --> 03:07:11.420
HE HAS KILLED NUMEROUS PEOPLE

03:07:11.486 --> 03:07:13.055
WE OFTENTIMES CAN'T SEE HIM

03:07:13.121 --> 03:07:14.523
BEING PEACEFULLY ARRESTED HE

03:07:14.590 --> 03:07:15.757
HAS NOT BEEN TASTY HAS NOT BEEN

03:07:15.824 --> 03:07:17.626
BETTER BEERS HE MAY EVEN BE

03:07:17.693 --> 03:07:18.961
TAKEN FOR ONE OF HIS FAVORITE

03:07:19.027 --> 03:07:20.729
MEALS AND SO THEREFORE WE DO

03:07:20.796 --> 03:07:22.364
NOT BELIEVE THAT TRAINING

03:07:22.431 --> 03:07:24.099
AROUND THE ESCALATION IS AN

03:07:24.166 --> 03:07:26.101
ISSUE BECAUSE CLEARLY. LAW

03:07:26.168 --> 03:07:27.703
ENFORCEMENT KNOWS HOW TO DE

03:07:27.769 --> 03:07:30.439
ESCALATE WHEN THEY DEEM IT TO

03:07:30.505 --> 03:07:34.276
BE APPROPRIATE- ALSO THERE IS

03:07:34.343 --> 03:07:36.912
THE ISSUE OF CENTER MASS

03:07:36.979 --> 03:07:40.549
SHOOTING. OF THE CENTER- WE ARE

03:07:40.616 --> 03:07:43.318
OFTENTIMES SEEING THESE TYPES

03:07:43.385 --> 03:07:45.153
OF KILLINGS WHERE. WHETHER

03:07:45.220 --> 03:07:47.022
ARMED OR UNARMED PEOPLE OF

03:07:47.089 --> 03:07:49.257
COLOR ARE BEING SHOT AT CENTER

03:07:49.324 --> 03:07:51.360
MASS. AND THEIR BODIES ARE

03:07:51.426 --> 03:07:53.061
BEING RIDDLED WITH NUMEROUS

03:07:53.128 --> 03:07:55.297
BULLETS OFTENTIMES LEADING INTO

03:07:55.364 --> 03:07:58.233
THEIR DEATH- WE WOULD LIKE TO

03:07:58.300 --> 03:08:00.135
SEE DIFFERENT TRAINING AROUND

03:08:00.202 --> 03:08:02.738
THAT- WHY IS IT THAT WE

03:08:02.804 --> 03:08:05.540
CONTINUE TO SEE VIRAL VIDEOS

03:08:05.607 --> 03:08:06.008
WHERE WE HAVE A WHITE

03:08:06.074 --> 03:08:09.111
ASSAILANTS- OR SUSPECT WHO IS

03:08:09.177 --> 03:08:11.980
ABLE TO. WRESTLE WITH OFFICERS

03:08:12.047 --> 03:08:14.616
TAKE THEIR WEAPONS TO BE ABLE

03:08:14.683 --> 03:08:16.284
TO JUMP INTO THEIR VEHICLES AND

03:08:16.351 --> 03:08:20.088
TAKE ALL OF THEM YET. WE GET

03:08:20.155 --> 03:08:22.357
BACK TO THE ISSUE OF AFRICAN

03:08:22.424 --> 03:08:24.393
AMERICAN AND OR LATINOS BEING

03:08:24.459 --> 03:08:27.195
KILLED- THERE WAS A QUESTION

03:08:27.262 --> 03:08:27.996
THAT WAS POSED TO ME HOW THIS

03:08:28.063 --> 03:08:29.865
TRAINING ENSURE AN OFFICER IS

03:08:29.931 --> 03:08:31.900
INTEGRATED INTO THE COMMUNITY-

03:08:31.967 --> 03:08:34.302
I BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF AND I'M

03:08:34.369 --> 03:08:35.203
GOING TO DEVIATE HERE FOR A

03:08:35.270 --> 03:08:37.272
MOMENT A LOT OF MY EXPERIENCE

03:08:37.339 --> 03:08:40.008
HAS COME FROM MY- RELATIONSHIP

03:08:40.075 --> 03:08:41.643
WITH CHIEF DANIEL HAHN. AND I

03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:42.711
BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

03:08:42.778 --> 03:08:45.180
ASKED COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WE

03:08:45.247 --> 03:08:46.948
BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THOSE TYPES

03:08:47.015 --> 03:08:49.151
OF RELATIONSHIPS IT IS BECAUSE

03:08:49.217 --> 03:08:51.353
OF THAT THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE

03:08:51.420 --> 03:08:52.854
TO GO OUT TO THE ACADEMY THAT I

03:08:52.921 --> 03:08:53.822
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO THROUGH

03:08:53.889 --> 03:08:55.390
THE USE OF FORCE SIMULATOR

03:08:55.457 --> 03:08:56.758
BECAUSE WHEN WE HEAR THE PUSH

03:08:56.825 --> 03:08:57.726
BACK FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL

03:08:57.793 --> 03:08:59.161
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WE GO%

03:08:59.227 --> 03:09:00.629
THROUGH YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WE

03:09:00.696 --> 03:09:02.564
HAVE TO DO. IN SPLIT SECONDS

03:09:02.631 --> 03:09:04.099
WELL IN ORDER FOR ME TO BE ABLE

03:09:04.166 --> 03:09:05.300
TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION

03:09:05.367 --> 03:09:06.568
NOT JUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:09:06.635 --> 03:09:08.303
BUT ALSO WITH MY COMMUNITY TO

03:09:08.370 --> 03:09:09.237
GET THEM TO HAVE A DIFFERENT

03:09:09.304 --> 03:09:11.873
UNDERSTANDING ON BOTH AISLES OF

03:09:11.940 --> 03:09:13.775
THE SPECTRUM- I WENT OUT TO THE

03:09:13.842 --> 03:09:15.243
ACADEMY. I'VE BEEN OUT OF THE

03:09:15.310 --> 03:09:16.478
ACADEMY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS

03:09:16.545 --> 03:09:17.879
WE'VE BEEN OUT OF THE ACADEMY

03:09:17.946 --> 03:09:20.582
WITH YOU- AND CONSULTING WITH

03:09:20.649 --> 03:09:22.250
YOU. HOW THEY PERCEIVE LAW

03:09:22.317 --> 03:09:23.618
ENFORCEMENT WHAT THEY WOULD

03:09:23.685 --> 03:09:25.454
LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN DIFFERENTLY-

03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:26.788
I WALKING A UNIQUE SPACE

03:09:26.855 --> 03:09:29.925
BETWEEN. THE CHIEF OF POLICE-

03:09:29.991 --> 03:09:31.326
FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY

03:09:31.393 --> 03:09:32.994
IMPACTED BY EXCESSIVE AND OR

03:09:33.061 --> 03:09:34.563
DEADLY USE OF FORCE. AND THEN

03:09:34.629 --> 03:09:35.363
THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER

03:09:35.430 --> 03:09:37.599
DEMOGRAPHIC- THAT WE OFTENTIMES

03:09:37.666 --> 03:09:38.967
DON'T TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK

03:09:39.034 --> 03:09:40.202
ABOUT INTERACTIONS WITH LAW

03:09:40.268 --> 03:09:42.237
ENFORCEMENT. AND THAT THOSE ARE

03:09:42.304 --> 03:09:45.540
THE FAMILIES OF CRIME VICTIMS-

03:09:45.607 --> 03:09:47.542
WE OFTENTIMES HEAR THERE IS

03:09:47.609 --> 03:09:49.177
WHAT I NOW CALL AFFECTIONATELY

03:09:49.244 --> 03:09:51.246
CALL HASHTAG ACTIVISM. AND THAT

03:09:51.313 --> 03:09:53.048
IS NOT TO DEMEAN ANY OF WHAT IS

03:09:53.115 --> 03:09:54.783
BEING SAID. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO

03:09:54.850 --> 03:09:56.651
KIND OF. EXPAND ON THAT A

03:09:56.718 --> 03:09:57.552
LITTLE BIT AND THAT IS THIS

03:09:57.619 --> 03:09:59.221
CONCEPT THAT HAS COME OUT OF.

03:09:59.287 --> 03:10:01.923
THE KILLING OF GEORGE FOLLOWED

03:10:01.990 --> 03:10:02.457
WHERE WE HEAR DEFINED THE

03:10:02.524 --> 03:10:05.060
POLICE. OKAY OFTENTIMES WHEN

03:10:05.127 --> 03:10:06.895
YOU HEAR PEOPLE SPEAK OF THIS

03:10:06.962 --> 03:10:08.196
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT RE

03:10:08.263 --> 03:10:10.899
ALLOCATING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF

03:10:10.966 --> 03:10:13.034
LAW ENFORCEMENT'S BUDGET. IN

03:10:13.101 --> 03:10:15.537
ORDER TO RE ENFRANCHISE THE

03:10:15.604 --> 03:10:17.372
COMMUNITY. BUT WHAT DOES THAT

03:10:17.439 --> 03:10:19.407
REALLY LOOK LIKE BECAUSE AGAIN

03:10:19.474 --> 03:10:20.776
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT SPECTRUMS

03:10:20.842 --> 03:10:22.944
HERE WE HAVE. COMMUNITY

03:10:23.011 --> 03:10:25.614
MEMBERS. WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS

03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:27.616
OF CRIME WHO ACTUALLY LOOKED TO

03:10:27.682 --> 03:10:29.651
LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ORDER TO BE

03:10:29.718 --> 03:10:30.852
ABLE TO HELP THEM SOLVE THE

03:10:30.919 --> 03:10:32.687
CRIME OR GET JUSTICE FOR THAT

03:10:32.754 --> 03:10:34.022
WHICH HAS BEEN PERPETRATED

03:10:34.089 --> 03:10:35.757
AGAINST THEM. IF WE DEFINE LAW

03:10:35.824 --> 03:10:37.192
ENFORCEMENT THERE WE ARE

03:10:37.259 --> 03:10:39.694
REMOVING THE NECESSITY OF THE

03:10:39.761 --> 03:10:42.030
RESOURCES THAT THESE FAMILIES

03:10:42.097 --> 03:10:43.064
NEED IN ORDER TO GET THE

03:10:43.131 --> 03:10:44.933
JUSTICE THAT THEY'RE SEEKING-

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.235
BUT- UP ON THE ISSUE OF THE

03:10:47.302 --> 03:10:48.670
FUNDING. I BELIEVE THAT IT'S

03:10:48.737 --> 03:10:49.938
MORE THAN JUST A FUNDING LAW

03:10:50.005 --> 03:10:51.039
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THE REALITY

03:10:51.106 --> 03:10:52.741
OF IT IS. DEFINING LAW

03:10:52.808 --> 03:10:54.276
ENFORCEMENT IS NOT GOING TO

03:10:54.342 --> 03:10:55.410
MAKE THE KILLINGS STOP.

03:10:55.477 --> 03:10:56.878
LEGISLATION IS NOT GOING TO

03:10:56.945 --> 03:10:58.146
MAKE THE KILLINGS STOP YOU

03:10:58.213 --> 03:11:00.182
CANNOT LEGISLATE AWAY SYSTEMIC

03:11:00.248 --> 03:11:02.350
RACISM. NOR CAN YOU LEGISLATE

03:11:02.417 --> 03:11:06.354
AWAY HATRED- I ABSOLUTELY LOVE

03:11:06.421 --> 03:11:08.957
HEARING ABOUT MR APPEALS.

03:11:09.024 --> 03:11:11.459
PERCEPTION OF WHAT LAW

03:11:11.526 --> 03:11:13.595
ENFORCEMENT SHOULD LOOK LIKE

03:11:13.662 --> 03:11:14.796
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE

03:11:14.863 --> 03:11:17.933
REALISTIC AND THAT HERE IN THE

03:11:17.999 --> 03:11:20.068
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA-

03:11:20.135 --> 03:11:23.405
POLICE CAME OUT OF. SLAVE

03:11:23.471 --> 03:11:26.641
PATROLS WHICH IF WE LOOK AT THE

03:11:26.708 --> 03:11:27.976
VIOLENCE THAT HAS BEEN

03:11:28.043 --> 03:11:29.311
PERPETRATED AGAINST AFRICAN

03:11:29.377 --> 03:11:31.913
AMERICANS AND LATINOS BUT VERY

03:11:31.980 --> 03:11:33.515
SPECIFICALLY AFRICAN AMERICANS

03:11:33.582 --> 03:11:35.650
IN THIS COUNTRY- IT HAS BEEN

03:11:35.717 --> 03:11:38.153
ROUTED IN VIOLENCE. UP YOU CAN

03:11:38.220 --> 03:11:40.555
GOOGLE LYNCHINGS RIGHT NOW AND

03:11:40.622 --> 03:11:42.324
YOU WILL SEE BLACK MEN WOMEN

SO WE HAVE TO BE COGNITIVE

03:12:03.345 --> 03:12:05.380
AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS

03:12:05.447 --> 03:12:06.548
NOT NECESSARILY AN ISSUE OF

03:12:08.316 --> 03:12:10.452
NECESSARILY AN ISSUE OF HOW DO

03:12:10.518 --> 03:12:12.320
WE REFORM A SYSTEM THAT WAS

03:12:12.387 --> 03:12:14.222
NEVER DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND

SYSTEMIC RACISM- AS FAR AS SOME

03:12:24.866 --> 03:12:26.601

SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY BEEN.

03:13:24.793 --> 03:13:26.261
PRESSING ON ME AS I SIT AND I

03:13:26.328 --> 03:13:28.363
LISTEN AROUND THE EDUCATIONAL

COMPONENTS- WE HEAR ABOUT THE

03:13:31.399 --> 03:13:32.968
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A

03:13:33.034 --> 03:13:34.502

03:13:39.407 --> 03:13:42.544
RAISE THE EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS

03:13:42.610 --> 03:13:44.646
AND GIVE TO THE COMMUNITIES

03:13:44.713 --> 03:13:47.048
INSTEAD OF LOWERING OR CHANGING

03:13:47.115 --> 03:13:49.084
THE REQUIREMENTS HOW DO WE RE

03:13:49.150 --> 03:13:50.919
ENFRANCHISE THE COMMUNITIES OF

03:13:50.986 --> 03:13:52.721
PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME TO BE

03:13:52.787 --> 03:13:54.255
ABLE TO GIVE THEM MORE THAN A

03:13:54.322 --> 03:13:55.690
SUB PAR OR SUB STANDARD

03:13:55.757 --> 03:13:57.892
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM SO THAT THEY

03:13:57.959 --> 03:14:00.829
CAN THEN BEGAN TO QUALIFY FOR

03:14:00.895 --> 03:14:02.998
THESE TYPES OF. JOBS THAT IS

03:14:03.064 --> 03:14:04.933
WHAT IS MOST INTERESTING TO ME

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:06.801
AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE

03:14:06.868 --> 03:14:08.203
FUNDING IT'S NOT JUST THE

03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:09.771
FUNDING LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S

03:14:09.838 --> 03:14:11.740
ABOUT THE FUNDING OF A RIGHTY

03:14:11.806 --> 03:14:13.074
OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TO RE

03:14:13.141 --> 03:14:14.976
ENFRANCHISE THE COMMUNITIES. SO

03:14:15.043 --> 03:14:17.312
THAT WE DO NOT CONTINUE TO HAVE

03:14:17.379 --> 03:14:18.413
CHILDREN OR PEOPLE IN OUR

03:14:18.480 --> 03:14:19.781
COMMUNITIES WHO ARE

03:14:19.848 --> 03:14:21.449
EXPERIENCING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

03:14:21.516 --> 03:14:23.284
EXPERIENCES THAT CONTINUE TO

03:14:23.351 --> 03:14:24.886
LEAD THEM TO ACCEPTING OR

03:14:24.953 --> 03:14:26.454
CHOOSING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR AS

03:14:26.521 --> 03:14:28.189
COPING MECHANISMS. WE HAVE

03:14:28.256 --> 03:14:30.325
CONTINUED TO BE CRIMINALIZED ND

03:14:30.392 --> 03:14:32.927
VALUE WISE IN THIS COUNTRY AS

03:14:32.994 --> 03:14:34.596
LONG AS WE HAVE STOOD FOOT ON

03:14:34.662 --> 03:14:37.732
IT AND SO THOUGH I RESPECT THE

03:14:37.799 --> 03:14:39.467
CONVERSATION AROUND THE

03:14:39.534 --> 03:14:41.603
NECESSITY FOR REFORM AGAIN I

03:14:41.669 --> 03:14:43.271
POSE THE QUESTION HOW DO YOU

03:14:43.338 --> 03:14:44.839
REFORM A SYSTEM THAT WAS NEVER

03:14:44.906 --> 03:14:46.841
DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND OR

03:14:46.908 --> 03:14:50.078
SERVE. ANYONE WHO LOOKS LIKE ME

03:14:50.145 --> 03:14:52.914
OR LIKE YOU. IN REGARDS TO

03:14:52.981 --> 03:14:54.582
EXCESSIVE OR DEADLY USE OF

03:14:54.649 --> 03:14:56.718
FORCE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT

03:14:56.785 --> 03:14:58.386
THAT IS AGAIN AN EXTENSION OF

03:14:58.453 --> 03:15:00.488
THE OF AMERICAN FOUNDATIONAL

03:15:00.555 --> 03:15:03.491
PRACTICES. HEY WE HAVE

03:15:03.558 --> 03:15:07.195
CONSISTENTLY SYSTEMATICALLY

03:15:07.262 --> 03:15:10.765
INTENTIONALLY BEEN TREATED AS

03:15:10.832 --> 03:15:12.734
SUB STANDARD WE SEE THAT AND

03:15:12.801 --> 03:15:15.070
LEGISLATION DOES NOT ALWAYS

03:15:15.136 --> 03:15:17.205
NECESSARILY HELP IT WAS WRITTEN

03:15:17.272 --> 03:15:18.573
IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT PEOPLE

03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:20.108
WHO LOOK LIKE ME OR THREE

03:15:20.175 --> 03:15:22.410
FIFTHS OF A HUMAN BEING WE MUST

03:15:22.477 --> 03:15:23.845
LOOK AT THE FOUNDATIONAL

03:15:23.912 --> 03:15:25.914
DOCUMENTS OF THIS COUNTRY. AND

03:15:25.980 --> 03:15:28.016
SEE HOW IT CONTINUES TO

03:15:28.083 --> 03:15:30.351
PERPETUATE THE OVERALL

03:15:30.418 --> 03:15:32.754
MENTALITY OF PEOPLE HERE THE

03:15:32.821 --> 03:15:35.190
STATISTICS ARE STARK TO HEAR

03:15:35.256 --> 03:15:36.758
THAT OVER 50% OF LAW

03:15:36.825 --> 03:15:38.259
ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IS

03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:41.763
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE MALES.

03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:43.465
AGAIN THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO

03:15:43.531 --> 03:15:45.600
ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHO

03:15:45.667 --> 03:15:47.035
RECOGNIZE US AS BEING HUMAN

03:15:47.102 --> 03:15:49.938
BEINGS. THE MAYOR COMPLEXION OF

03:15:50.004 --> 03:15:53.108
MY SKIN MAKES ME A CRIMINAL IN

03:15:53.174 --> 03:15:55.176
THIS COUNTRY THAT IS

03:15:55.243 --> 03:15:59.481
PROBLEMATIC. WHEN WE COMPARED

03:15:59.547 --> 03:16:01.616
THE UNITED STATES TO OTHER

03:16:01.683 --> 03:16:03.384
COUNTRIES IN REGARDS TO

03:16:03.451 --> 03:16:05.520
POLICING I THINK AGAIN THAT WE

03:16:05.587 --> 03:16:07.755
WOULD BE A MESS IF WE DID NOT

03:16:07.822 --> 03:16:09.691
RECOGNIZE THAT THE UNITED

03:16:09.757 --> 03:16:11.493
STATES OF AMERICA HAS SOCIALLY

03:16:11.559 --> 03:16:13.728
CONSTRUCTED PSYCHOLOGICALLY

03:16:13.795 --> 03:16:15.497
INDOCTRINATED THIS THING CALLED

03:16:15.563 --> 03:16:20.535
RACE. WHICH LEADS TO RACISM.

03:16:20.602 --> 03:16:22.637
WHICH ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE TO

03:16:22.704 --> 03:16:25.874
OTHER ONE ANOTHER. WE SAY THAT

03:16:25.940 --> 03:16:27.075
POLICING IS SUPPOSED TO BE

03:16:27.142 --> 03:16:28.576
INCLUSIVE THAT IT IS THE

03:16:28.643 --> 03:16:30.778
COMMUNITY HOWEVER THERE IS THAT

03:16:30.845 --> 03:16:34.482
US VERSUS THEM MENTALITY SO

03:16:34.549 --> 03:16:36.651
THEREFORE LAW ENFORCEMENT NOR

03:16:36.718 --> 03:16:40.221
THE COMMUNITIES. ARE ABLE TO

03:16:40.288 --> 03:16:42.257
BRIDGE THE GAP IT IS THROUGH

03:16:42.323 --> 03:16:43.691
THE TYPE OF WORK IT IS THROUGH

03:16:43.758 --> 03:16:45.393
THE TYPE OF PROGRAMMING THAT

03:16:45.460 --> 03:16:46.261
CHIEF DANIEL HAHN IS

03:16:46.327 --> 03:16:49.297
IMPLEMENTING- THAT WE ARE ABLE

03:16:49.364 --> 03:16:50.565
TO BEGIN TO OPEN UP AND HAVE

03:16:50.632 --> 03:16:52.400
THESE CONVERSATIONS AND LOOK AT

03:16:52.467 --> 03:16:54.402
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE FOR US

03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:56.037
TO COME TOGETHER TO BUILD

03:16:56.104 --> 03:16:58.006
SOMETHING NEW DIFFERENT

03:16:58.072 --> 03:17:01.609
SUSTAINABLE- ARM. WHEN WE LOOK

03:17:01.676 --> 03:17:04.979
AT A PROFESSIONALISM OR WE TALK

03:17:05.046 --> 03:17:06.915
ABOUT THE CORE OF POLICING AND

03:17:06.981 --> 03:17:08.316
THAT THAT THE CORE POLICING IS

03:17:08.383 --> 03:17:10.518
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AGAIN WHEN WE

03:17:10.585 --> 03:17:11.986
TALK ABOUT COMMUNITIES THAT

03:17:12.053 --> 03:17:13.721
LOOK LIKE ME. THAT'S

03:17:13.788 --> 03:17:16.758
PROBLEMATIC- WE RECENTLY HAD A

03:17:16.824 --> 03:17:18.459
KILLING OF TWO YOUNG MEN AT

03:17:18.526 --> 03:17:21.229
ARDEN FAIR MALL AND OUR MAYOR

03:17:21.296 --> 03:17:23.598
CAME OUT AND MADE A COMMENT

03:17:23.665 --> 03:17:26.267
ALLUDING THAT THIS MAY BE GANG

03:17:26.334 --> 03:17:27.902
RELATED VIOLENCE. I PERSONALLY

03:17:27.969 --> 03:17:30.104
KNOW THESE TWO YOUNG MEN. THEY

03:17:30.171 --> 03:17:31.806
WERE FRIENDS OF MY DAUGHTERS

03:17:31.873 --> 03:17:33.508
THIS WAS NOT GANG RELATED

03:17:33.575 --> 03:17:35.343
HOWEVER OUT OF THAT

03:17:35.410 --> 03:17:38.813
CONVERSATION CAME. WE NEED

03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:40.148
THERE'S A NECESSITY FOR

03:17:40.215 --> 03:17:41.316
ADDITIONAL GANG TASK FORCE

03:17:41.382 --> 03:17:43.218
OFFICERS ARE THESE OFFICERS IN

03:17:43.284 --> 03:17:46.087
OUR COMMUNITY TO ACTUALLY DEAL

03:17:46.154 --> 03:17:48.289
WITH THE ISSUES THAT MAY

03:17:48.356 --> 03:17:50.291
CONTRIBUTE TO ONE JOINING A

03:17:50.358 --> 03:17:53.561
GANG. ARE WE REALLY LOOKING AT

03:17:53.628 --> 03:17:55.129
THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THESE

03:17:55.196 --> 03:17:56.864
YOU COME FROM ECONOMICALLY

03:17:56.931 --> 03:17:58.499
DEPRIVED AND DISENFRANCHISED

03:17:58.566 --> 03:18:00.401
COMMUNITIES THAT A LOT OF THEM

03:18:00.468 --> 03:18:02.537
ARE FOSTER YOU A LOT OF THEM

03:18:02.604 --> 03:18:04.639
ARE BEING RAISED BY A NON

03:18:04.706 --> 03:18:06.274
PARENT THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE

03:18:06.341 --> 03:18:07.475
EITHER CAUGHT UP IN MASS

03:18:07.542 --> 03:18:09.644
INCARCERATION OR MAY YOU KNOW

03:18:09.711 --> 03:18:10.712
SUFFER FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE

03:18:10.778 --> 03:18:12.714
ISSUES. IT'S EASY FOR US TO

03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:14.882
CONTINUE TO CRIMINALIZE OUR

03:18:14.949 --> 03:18:16.718
CONDITION BUT WE ARE NOT

03:18:16.784 --> 03:18:18.453
TALKING ABOUT THE SYSTEMIC

03:18:18.519 --> 03:18:20.855
ISSUES THAT CREATE THE ISSUES

03:18:20.922 --> 03:18:23.391
THAT WE AND WE THEN IN TURN

03:18:23.458 --> 03:18:24.359
HAVE TO ENCOUNTER LAW

03:18:24.425 --> 03:18:26.094
ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE BEEN

03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:28.296
CRIMINALIZED FROM THE TIME WE

03:18:28.363 --> 03:18:31.366
SET. FOOT ON THE SOIL SO HOW DO

03:18:31.432 --> 03:18:32.867
WE ACTUALLY START TO DEAL WITH

03:18:32.934 --> 03:18:34.736
THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE THOSE ARE

03:18:34.802 --> 03:18:38.072
THE ISSUES. THAT LEAD TO POLICE

03:18:38.139 --> 03:18:39.574
VIOLENCE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO

03:18:39.641 --> 03:18:43.311
LOOK LIKE US. SO YOU KNOW FOR

03:18:43.378 --> 03:18:46.848

03:18:46.914 --> 03:18:49.450
THEN HOW DO WE DEAL WITH ISSUES

03:18:49.517 --> 03:18:52.720
OF REFORM- THERE HAVE BEEN-

03:18:52.787 --> 03:18:55.223
BEEN SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES. FOR

03:18:55.290 --> 03:18:57.759
US TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY YET

03:18:57.825 --> 03:19:00.361
WE FAIL TO DO THAT- I'M LOOKING

03:19:00.428 --> 03:19:02.897
AT THE WAY THAT. WE CONTINUE TO

03:19:02.964 --> 03:19:05.033
MILITARIZE THE POLICE MISS LANE

03:19:05.099 --> 03:19:07.135
I'M SORRY CAN YOU- WE HAVE ONE

03:19:07.201 --> 03:19:08.503
MORE MINUTE FOR YOU CAN JUST

VERY MUCH NO PROBLEM SO TO

03:19:11.339 --> 03:19:13.374
CLOSE OUT WEEK WE CONTINUE TO

03:19:13.441 --> 03:19:14.542
MILITARIZE POLICE IN THIS

03:19:14.609 --> 03:19:16.978
COUNTRY. HOWEVER IF OUR

03:19:17.045 --> 03:19:18.946
MILITARY PERSONNEL ENGAGED IN

TOPLINE POINT- LAW ENFORCEMENT

OFFICERS DO NOT RECEIVE MUCH

03:25:32.586 --> 03:25:34.522
ONGOING TRAINING PERIOD. NOT

03:25:34.588 --> 03:25:37.258
ALL TRAINING IS CREATED EQUALLY-

03:25:37.324 --> 03:25:38.125
JUST BECAUSE AN OFFICER IS

03:25:38.192 --> 03:25:40.161
QUOTED TRAINED ON AN ISSUE DOES

03:25:40.227 --> 03:25:41.429
NOT MEAN THE TRAINING IS

03:25:41.495 --> 03:25:47.802

AND I THINK WE SHOULD DO THE

03:26:00.347 --> 03:26:03.651
SAME THING WITH THE POST- WOOD

03:26:03.718 --> 03:26:04.952
BUT I DO APPRECIATE THEIR

03:26:05.019 --> 03:26:06.987
TRAINING- IT'S ALSO NOT ALWAYS

03:26:07.054 --> 03:26:09.056
TRAINED TO DO WHAT LAWMAKERS OR

03:26:09.123 --> 03:26:11.559
THE PUBLIC EXPECT THEM TO DO-

03:26:11.625 --> 03:26:15.062
MANY TIMES. AND IT'S JUST THE

03:26:15.129 --> 03:26:18.365
FORM THAT IT- IT IS DONE AND-

03:26:18.432 --> 03:26:19.767
LOG OUT FIRST PASSED AND THEN

03:26:19.834 --> 03:26:22.703
WE BECOME- A LOT OF TIMES. THE

03:26:22.770 --> 03:26:28.776
IMPLEMENTATION AND BECOMING. OR.

03:26:28.843 --> 03:26:30.311
PROVIDING TRAINING. FIVE SO

03:26:30.377 --> 03:26:30.945
SOMETIMES THERE'S A ONE OR TWO

03:26:31.011 --> 03:26:32.913
YEAR GAP IN OPTIONS NOT PROPER.

03:26:32.980 --> 03:26:34.482
TRAINED IN WHAT THE LAWS HAVE

03:26:34.548 --> 03:26:35.816
BEEN PASSED BUT WE ARE HELD

03:26:35.883 --> 03:26:37.485
ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE LAWS IN

03:26:37.551 --> 03:26:41.055
THAT TIME- ONE OF THE STARKEST

03:26:41.122 --> 03:26:43.023
EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THAT

03:26:43.090 --> 03:26:44.024
PROPOSED HAS COMPLETED THE

03:26:44.091 --> 03:26:46.293
MODEL DE ESCALATION TRAINING-

03:26:46.360 --> 03:26:48.062
IN THE AST FEW MONTHS. EVEN

03:26:48.129 --> 03:26:48.929
THOUGH POLICE OFFICERS ARE

03:26:48.996 --> 03:26:50.064
BEING HELD TO THE STANDARD

03:26:50.131 --> 03:26:51.398
ESTABLISHED IN THE ASSEMBLY

03:26:51.465 --> 03:26:52.767
BILL THREE NINETY TWO FROM A

03:26:52.833 --> 03:26:54.602
COUPLE OF YEARS BACK. OFFICERS

03:26:54.668 --> 03:26:56.303
HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED ON HOW TO

03:26:56.370 --> 03:26:58.072
COMPLY WITH THE NEW STANDARD. I

03:26:58.139 --> 03:26:59.273
HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH ONE

03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:00.941
OF OUR TRAINERS IN THE LOS

03:27:01.008 --> 03:27:02.309
ANGELES POLICE ACADEMY THE

03:27:02.376 --> 03:27:03.677
CHANGE THAT CHANGED OUR-

03:27:03.744 --> 03:27:07.114
RECRUITING TACTICS. AND SHE

03:27:07.181 --> 03:27:09.917
WAS- ARE STILL CONFUSED AFTER

03:27:09.984 --> 03:27:11.285
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AND SOME

03:27:11.352 --> 03:27:13.320
OF THE- DIRECTION THAT SHE HAD

03:27:13.387 --> 03:27:14.855
GOTTEN. AND FROM A COMPUTER

03:27:14.922 --> 03:27:17.224
TRAINER TO THE NEW RECRUITS YOU

03:27:17.291 --> 03:27:19.226
CAN SEE THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE

03:27:19.293 --> 03:27:20.661
NOT PREPARING OUR OFFICERS

03:27:20.728 --> 03:27:24.298
SUFFICIENTLY. BOB FOR THE

03:27:24.365 --> 03:27:25.666
STREET. EVEN THOUGH IT MAY

03:27:25.733 --> 03:27:28.836
THINK. MORE FIREARMS TRAINING

03:27:28.903 --> 03:27:32.807
WILL HELP OFFICERS- AND- IT'S

03:27:32.873 --> 03:27:35.376
EASY TO. I'VE HEARD THESE

03:27:35.442 --> 03:27:36.377
THINGS THAT OFFICES ARE GETTING

03:27:36.443 --> 03:27:38.012
TOO MUCH FIREARMS TRAINING AND

03:27:38.078 --> 03:27:39.413
THAT WE'RE CREATING KILLERS AND

03:27:39.480 --> 03:27:41.015
THAT TYPE OF STUFF AND THAT

03:27:41.081 --> 03:27:45.553
SIMPLY IS NOT TRUE- MORE SELF

03:27:45.619 --> 03:27:47.521
DEFENSE TRAINING- ALL. FIREARMS

03:27:47.588 --> 03:27:50.724
TRAINING- WILL ONLY RESULT IN

03:27:50.791 --> 03:27:53.561
MORE SELF CONFIDENT OFFICERS

03:27:53.627 --> 03:27:54.094
WHO HAVE COMPETITION THEIR

03:27:54.161 --> 03:27:57.832
SKILLS. AND BIG WILL DEREK

03:27:57.898 --> 03:28:00.401
BENNER TO DEPLOYED ITS TACTICS

03:28:00.467 --> 03:28:01.802
AND THE PROPER POLICY APPROVED

03:28:01.869 --> 03:28:04.538
TACTICS. BECAUSE IN HER

03:28:04.605 --> 03:28:08.008
COMPETENCE AND- AND- ABILITY TO

03:28:08.075 --> 03:28:09.643
CONTROL THE SITUATION IN HIGH

03:28:09.710 --> 03:28:11.412
STRESS SITUATIONS WE FALL BACK

03:28:11.478 --> 03:28:13.547
ON TRAINING AND MUSCLE MEMORY

03:28:13.614 --> 03:28:14.582
IN ORDER TO DEVELOP MUSCLE

03:28:14.648 --> 03:28:16.116
MEMORY THOUGHT PATTERNS AND

03:28:16.183 --> 03:28:17.518
PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS HAVE TO BE

03:28:17.585 --> 03:28:19.353
TRAINED THOUSANDS OF TIMES OVER

03:28:19.420 --> 03:28:21.922
SO THAT IT BECOMES NOT OF

03:28:21.989 --> 03:28:23.090
AUTOMATION. WHEN CALLED UPON.

03:28:23.157 --> 03:28:25.092
THE COMPETENT AND CONFIDENT-

03:28:25.159 --> 03:28:27.161
AND STATE POLICE OFFICER THERE

03:28:27.228 --> 03:28:28.562
FOR STATE POLICE OFFICER THEY

03:28:28.629 --> 03:28:29.897
ARE LIKELY TO USE LESS FORCE

03:28:29.964 --> 03:28:31.098
THAN THOSE WHO HAVE NO

03:28:31.165 --> 03:28:33.234
COMPETENCE OR LITTLE CONFIDENCE

03:28:33.300 --> 03:28:37.238
IN THEIR TRAINING. RIGOROUS

03:28:37.304 --> 03:28:40.007
TRAINING MUST BE ONGOING. IT IS

03:28:40.074 --> 03:28:42.243
IT IS GOING TO YIELD THE RESULT

03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:44.178
THAT LAWMAKERS HOPING FOR. THIS

03:28:44.245 --> 03:28:45.312
MEANS RECOGNIZING THE

03:28:45.379 --> 03:28:46.480
RECOGNIZING THAT WHEN

03:28:46.547 --> 03:28:48.015
DEPARTMENTS ARE DECLINED IT THE

03:28:48.082 --> 03:28:48.749
FIRST THING THAT CAUGHT OUR

03:28:48.816 --> 03:28:51.552
EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY THE

03:28:51.619 --> 03:28:52.052
SECOND THING IS CUT OUR

03:28:52.119 --> 03:28:54.421
CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES. THE THIRD

03:28:54.488 --> 03:28:56.457
TIER OF CUTS ARE TRAINING.

03:28:56.523 --> 03:28:58.659
WELLNESS PROGRAMS OFFICERS AND

03:28:58.726 --> 03:28:59.994
SPECIALIZED UNITS. THE FUNDING%

03:29:00.060 --> 03:29:01.462
DEPARTMENT PRODUCES LOWER

03:29:01.528 --> 03:29:02.663
QUALITY DEPARTMENTS WERE

03:29:02.730 --> 03:29:06.267
STRETCHED THIN AND ARE NOT-ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF

03:29:06.333 --> 03:29:08.035
PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY BECOME

03:29:08.102 --> 03:29:10.771
REAL PROBLEMS. IT'S ACTUALLY

03:29:10.838 --> 03:29:15.576
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I'M

03:29:15.643 --> 03:29:16.744
GOING TRAINING FOR PEACE

03:29:16.810 --> 03:29:19.013
OFFICERS IS VITAL BECAUSE MANY

03:29:19.079 --> 03:29:20.748
OF THE SKILLS THAT I LEARNED IN

03:29:20.814 --> 03:29:21.482
THE ACADEMY ARE PERISHABLE

03:29:21.548 --> 03:29:23.284
SKILLS. AND NEED TO BE

03:29:23.350 --> 03:29:25.219
CONTINUOUSLY REFRESHED IN ORDER

03:29:25.286 --> 03:29:26.287
TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THE

03:29:26.353 --> 03:29:28.756
OFFICER THE SUSPECT AND THE

03:29:28.822 --> 03:29:31.025
BYSTANDERS. POST REQUIRED

ONGOING TRAINING TWENTY FOUR

03:29:32.693 --> 03:29:33.928
HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS BUT THIS

03:29:33.994 --> 03:29:36.397
TRAIN DOES NOT PREPARE OFFICERS

03:29:36.463 --> 03:29:36.931
FOR THE EXPECTATION TWENTY

03:29:36.997 --> 03:29:39.166
FIRST CENTURY. BOB PERSONAL

03:29:39.233 --> 03:29:40.367
SKILLS TRAINING CONSISTS OF A

03:29:40.434 --> 03:29:42.636
MINIMUM OF FOURTEEN HOURS EVERY

03:29:42.703 --> 03:29:44.271
TWO YEARS. THE FOCUS OF THIS

03:29:44.338 --> 03:29:45.773
TRAINING HAS TO BE ON THE

03:29:45.839 --> 03:29:48.342
ARREST OF CONTROL- IT'S USUALLY

03:29:48.409 --> 03:29:51.078
HAND CUPPING SUSPECT DRIVING.

03:29:51.145 --> 03:29:52.513
IT COULD BE SLOW SPEED DRIVING

03:29:52.579 --> 03:29:55.115
AND PARKING THE VEHICLE AND

03:29:55.182 --> 03:29:56.850
QUALIFYING WITH A FIREARM. BOB

03:29:56.917 --> 03:29:58.652
ALTERCATION IS- WHATEVER HAS

03:29:58.719 --> 03:29:59.620
BEEN ESTABLISHED AS MINIMUM

03:29:59.687 --> 03:30:02.289
STANDARDS AND OFTEN TIMES-

03:30:02.356 --> 03:30:04.725
DEPARTMENTS ARE STRETCHED JAN

03:30:04.792 --> 03:30:08.262
AND BARE. BOB DONNAN UNABLE TO

03:30:08.329 --> 03:30:10.864
PROVIDE FURTHER. MEANINGFUL

03:30:10.931 --> 03:30:12.800
YEAH INSTRUCTION IN FIREARMS

03:30:12.866 --> 03:30:16.236
TRAINING IN REALITY WE DO WE

03:30:16.303 --> 03:30:17.871
SPEND ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AT THE

03:30:17.938 --> 03:30:19.173
RANGE QUALIFYING FIVE TIMES A

03:30:19.239 --> 03:30:21.875
YEAR WITHOUT SIDE SIDE ARM AND

03:30:21.942 --> 03:30:24.311
WITH A SHOT GUN ONCE A YEAR-

03:30:24.378 --> 03:30:26.347
AND THAT IS THE EXTENT OF OUR

03:30:26.413 --> 03:30:29.049
TRAINING SO THAT AMOUNTS ABOUT.

03:30:29.116 --> 03:30:30.484
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES OF

03:30:30.551 --> 03:30:34.455
REQUIRED- LOG OF FIREARMS

03:30:34.521 --> 03:30:35.489
SHOOTING AND TRAINING. SO THE

03:30:35.556 --> 03:30:37.691
THOSE ARE THE REAL QUALITIES-

03:30:37.758 --> 03:30:39.259
OF THE REALITIES OF LOG A LOT

03:30:39.326 --> 03:30:41.729
OF TRAINING. SO I WOULD NOT

03:30:41.795 --> 03:30:42.863
CONSIDER THESE REQUIREMENTS TO

03:30:42.930 --> 03:30:46.633
BE A RIGOROUS AT ALL- AND THEN

03:30:46.700 --> 03:30:47.768
I JUST TOUCHED UPON THE PUBLIC

03:30:47.835 --> 03:30:50.070
FIREARMS QUALIFICATION IS FOR A

03:30:50.137 --> 03:30:51.372
LOT OF DEPARTMENTS SOME DO

03:30:51.438 --> 03:30:52.339
QUARTERLY COME TO EVERY OTHER

03:30:52.406 --> 03:30:55.476
MONTH- BUT- OFTENTIMES UNLESS

03:30:55.542 --> 03:30:57.578
YOU WORK IN A SPECIALIZED UNIT

03:30:57.644 --> 03:30:58.078
YOU'RE NOT RECEIVING THE

03:30:58.145 --> 03:30:59.580
TRAINING THAT YOU NEED. A

03:30:59.646 --> 03:31:02.449
SPECIALIZED UNITS ARE NOT- FOR

03:31:02.516 --> 03:31:04.518
THE MOST PART- FIRST RESPONDING

03:31:04.585 --> 03:31:08.555
PATROL UNITS BOB THAT YOU YOU

03:31:08.622 --> 03:31:09.656
RECEIVE WHEN YOU CALL NINE ONE

03:31:09.723 --> 03:31:11.025
ONE- LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

03:31:11.091 --> 03:31:12.226
HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TACTICAL. AND

03:31:12.292 --> 03:31:13.560
INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION

03:31:13.627 --> 03:31:15.162
TECHNIQUES BUT WE RECEIVED TWO

03:31:15.229 --> 03:31:17.464
HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS. THIS IS

03:31:17.531 --> 03:31:18.098
NOT ENOUGH TRAINING TO PRODUCE

03:31:18.165 --> 03:31:20.734
OFFICERS SKILLED AT DE

03:31:20.801 --> 03:31:22.503
ESCALATION TECHNIQUES. ALTHOUGH

03:31:22.569 --> 03:31:24.671
MANY DEPARTMENTS THEY ATTEMPT

03:31:24.738 --> 03:31:25.873
TO DO THE BEST JOB THAT THEY

03:31:25.939 --> 03:31:28.308
CAN PROVIDING NEEDS- THAT THE

03:31:28.375 --> 03:31:30.878
TRAINING AND IT VARIES- IT'S

03:31:30.944 --> 03:31:33.714
JUST NOT ENOUGH- SO WHEN I

03:31:33.781 --> 03:31:35.516
LISTEN TO. SOME TALK ABOUT DE

03:31:35.582 --> 03:31:37.484
ESCALATION IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE

03:31:37.551 --> 03:31:39.486
WHAT HAS BEEN ASKED IS PHONE

03:31:39.553 --> 03:31:41.955
OFFICER WHO WAS ADVANCED- QUITE

03:31:42.022 --> 03:31:43.424
ADVANCED TRAINING IN CRIMINAL

03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:44.658
PSYCHOLOGY CLINICAL

03:31:44.725 --> 03:31:46.660
CRIMINOLOGY. AND ADVANCING

03:31:46.727 --> 03:31:49.229
GLACIATIONS SKILLS AND- THAT IS

03:31:49.296 --> 03:31:52.066
JUST SIMPLY NOT- TRUE AND THAT

03:31:52.132 --> 03:31:54.501
IS NOT THE REALITY AND- WE DID

03:31:54.568 --> 03:31:56.236
FOCUS GROUPS ON A COUPLE OF

03:31:56.303 --> 03:31:57.504
YEARS AGO STATEWIDE FOCUS

03:31:57.571 --> 03:31:59.606
GROUPS AND WE ASK PEOPLE WHAT

03:31:59.673 --> 03:32:00.340
THEIR PERCEPTION OF WHAT THEY

03:32:00.407 --> 03:32:02.342
BELIEVED. AN OFFICERS TRAINING%

03:32:02.409 --> 03:32:04.945
TO BE. AND THE PERCEPTION THAT

03:32:05.012 --> 03:32:06.680
THE PUBLIC GENERAL PUBLIC HELD

03:32:06.747 --> 03:32:07.281
IN CALIFORNIA BUT LAW

03:32:07.347 --> 03:32:08.949
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THEIR

03:32:09.016 --> 03:32:11.151
TRAINING- WHAT ABOUT NIGHT AND

03:32:11.218 --> 03:32:13.821
DAY BETWEEN WHAT THEY THINK AND

03:32:13.887 --> 03:32:15.489
WHAT ACTUALLY IS- THERE WERE

03:32:15.556 --> 03:32:16.457
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY THOUGHT

03:32:16.523 --> 03:32:17.958
THAT WE STATE WE NEED TO START

03:32:18.025 --> 03:32:20.160
THE DAY AT THE RANGE. BAYAT

03:32:20.227 --> 03:32:21.862
BECOMING EXPERT- SHOOTERS WE

03:32:21.929 --> 03:32:23.097
ARE NOT EXPERT SHOOTERS WE ARE

03:32:23.163 --> 03:32:25.332
NOT- THE MOST ABOUT THAT EXPERT

03:32:25.399 --> 03:32:27.901
SHOOTERS- WE ARE NOT A TRAINED

03:32:27.968 --> 03:32:29.937
MARTIAL ARTISTS- WE GET SOME

03:32:30.003 --> 03:32:34.975
TRAINING AND ALL THAT. GOES UP

03:32:35.042 --> 03:32:39.446
HARASSED- I AM LOVE WE GET

03:32:39.513 --> 03:32:41.148
COURTNEY COURSES IS NOT THAT

03:32:41.215 --> 03:32:42.649
MUCH FROM WHAT IS BEING ACTUAL

03:32:42.716 --> 03:32:45.419
POLICE OFFICERS AND I AM MOST

03:32:45.486 --> 03:32:47.855
FORTY HOURS OF TRAINING- SO.

03:32:47.921 --> 03:32:48.589
THAT IS NOT THE LEVEL OF

03:32:48.655 --> 03:32:49.857
TRAINING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

03:32:49.923 --> 03:32:53.961
PROVIDES TO OFFICERS AND WHAT

03:32:54.027 --> 03:32:56.063
I'M ALSO TALKING ABOUT IS IT

03:32:56.130 --> 03:32:58.832
SUPPOSED BEING FUNDED PROPERLY-

03:32:58.899 --> 03:32:59.766
IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO

03:32:59.833 --> 03:33:02.136
RESOURCES AND BUDGETARY ISSUES

03:33:02.202 --> 03:33:04.004
AND FUNDING AND I REALIZE THAT

03:33:04.071 --> 03:33:04.538
THE LEGISLATURE IS A VERY

03:33:04.605 --> 03:33:06.740
DIFFICULT JOB. IN A MAKING

03:33:06.807 --> 03:33:08.342
MONEY LAST FOR ALL PASSAGE OF

03:33:08.408 --> 03:33:10.878
CALIFORNIANS NEEDS- BUT CAN'T

03:33:10.944 --> 03:33:12.946
IT HAS BECOME SUCH A BIG ISSUE

03:33:13.013 --> 03:33:14.348
WE WOULD ASK THE LEGISLATURE

03:33:14.414 --> 03:33:16.416
TO. MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

POLICE TRAINING- SO WE REALLY

03:33:23.690 --> 03:33:25.025
NEED TO TAKE MORE INTENSE LOOK

03:33:25.092 --> 03:33:26.360
AT INVESTING IN THE QUALITY

03:33:26.426 --> 03:33:27.828

03:33:56.924 --> 03:33:58.559
IMPORTANT COURSE SUIT TO BE HAD

03:33:58.625 --> 03:34:00.394
AND IT SHOULD BE MANDATED.

03:34:00.460 --> 03:34:01.395
ANOTHER ONE SHOULD BE

03:34:01.461 --> 03:34:03.163
CONSTITUTIONAL TRAINING AT THE

03:34:03.230 --> 03:34:06.533

03:34:42.202 --> 03:34:46.273
PERSPECTIVE OF HOW- HOW THINGS

03:34:46.340 --> 03:34:47.541
CAN. HAPPEN AND HOW QUICKLY

03:34:47.608 --> 03:34:49.309
THEY HAVE BEEN AND HOW VOLATILE

03:34:49.376 --> 03:34:50.811
THINGS CAN BE. AND I HAVE I

03:34:50.877 --> 03:34:52.112
HAVE ATTENDED MY SHARE OF

03:34:52.179 --> 03:34:54.514
POLICE GENERALS AND THOSE ARE

03:34:54.581 --> 03:34:55.082
REAL LIFE AFFECTED JUST THE

03:34:55.148 --> 03:34:59.286
WAY- ARE- YEAH ACTIVISTS TALK

03:34:59.353 --> 03:35:00.621
ABOUT LIFE THAT ARE LOST IN

03:35:00.687 --> 03:35:03.390
PLEASE BEEN COUNTER SO- CUTS

03:35:03.457 --> 03:35:06.126
BOTH WAYS- WE HAVE ALSO

03:35:06.193 --> 03:35:07.194
CONDUCTED COMMUNITY POLICE

03:35:07.261 --> 03:35:09.563
ACADEMIES- IN IN HIGH CRIME

03:35:09.630 --> 03:35:11.498
AREAS. THAT WE FIND TO BE VERY

03:35:11.565 --> 03:35:13.467
HELPFUL ALL THESE I THINK THAT

03:35:13.533 --> 03:35:16.670
SHOULD BE TRIED IN EVERY- EVERY

03:35:16.737 --> 03:35:19.239
COMMUNITY- THAT. THERE'S A NEED

03:35:19.306 --> 03:35:20.207
FOR AND MAYBE NOT EVERY

03:35:20.274 --> 03:35:21.608
COMMUNITY I THINK ONE THING TO

03:35:21.675 --> 03:35:23.277
REMEMBER IS THAT WE ARE NOT

03:35:23.343 --> 03:35:25.612
MONOLITHIC. WE ARE NOT-

03:35:25.679 --> 03:35:26.880
COMMUNITIES ARMAND NOT

03:35:26.947 --> 03:35:28.148
MONOLITHIC AND I THINK THERE

03:35:28.215 --> 03:35:29.883
SHOULD BE SOME ECONOMY FOR TO

03:35:29.950 --> 03:35:32.152
EACH JURISDICTION BE GIVEN AND

03:35:32.219 --> 03:35:33.987
SEE WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES IS IT

03:35:34.054 --> 03:35:36.290
NOT IN TRAINING- BUT THERE

03:35:36.356 --> 03:35:38.058
SHOULD BE SOME THINGS THAT ARE.

03:35:38.125 --> 03:35:39.960
ARE STANDARDIZED AND WE CAN

03:35:40.027 --> 03:35:41.261
ALWAYS WE SHOULD ALWAYS AIM TO

03:35:41.328 --> 03:35:43.196
HAVE BILLS STANDARDIZATION IS

03:35:43.263 --> 03:35:47.834
ADS- HIGH. VALUE IN TRAINING AS

03:35:47.901 --> 03:35:50.304
POSSIBLE- WHAT I STATED- I'LL

03:35:50.370 --> 03:35:52.339
GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF- OF

03:35:52.406 --> 03:35:53.407
DISCONNECT WHEN I STATED

03:35:53.473 --> 03:35:54.374
EARLIER THAT THE PEACE OFFICERS

03:35:54.441 --> 03:35:55.575
ARE NOT TRAINED TO DO WHAT

03:35:55.642 --> 03:35:57.744
LAWMAKERS OR THE PUBLIC EXPECT

03:35:57.811 --> 03:35:59.046
THEM TO DO. I MEANT THAT THERE

03:35:59.112 --> 03:36:00.347
IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE

03:36:00.414 --> 03:36:01.682
OFFICERS ARE TRAINED WHAT

03:36:01.748 --> 03:36:02.883
THEY'RE TRAINED IN DOING AND

03:36:02.949 --> 03:36:04.651
WHAT IS EXPECTED OF OFFICERS.

03:36:04.718 --> 03:36:06.219
OPERATE THE DAY BETWEEN NINETY

03:36:06.286 --> 03:36:07.654
TWO AND I REFER TO THAT. AS

03:36:07.721 --> 03:36:10.190
ABOUT EARLIER WHEN OUR OWN SOME

03:36:10.257 --> 03:36:11.858
OF OUR OWN TRAINERS. ARE

03:36:11.925 --> 03:36:15.128
CONFUSED. TWO YEARS LATER-

ABOUT THE LANGUAGE ABOUT ARE.

03:36:18.932 --> 03:36:20.967
NOT GETTING ENOUGH DIRECTION-

03:36:21.034 --> 03:36:24.071
FROM MODEST STATE- YOU CAN YOU

03:36:24.137 --> 03:36:26.907

03:36:32.112 --> 03:36:36.683
WE HAVE TO DO ALL RIGHT. FOR

03:36:36.750 --> 03:36:37.317
THE OCCASION AND MAKE SURE THAT

03:36:37.384 --> 03:36:38.952

WHERE- WE HAVE A GREAT CHANCE

03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.877

MISTER CHAIR I'M ALWAYS READY

03:38:29.162 --> 03:38:31.731
WITH MY QUESTION- SO I THINK

03:38:31.798 --> 03:38:33.099
THE PANELISTS FOR AT THAT

03:38:33.166 --> 03:38:34.634
INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT

03:38:34.701 --> 03:38:35.268
TRAINING I ALSO ANYTHING MISS

03:38:35.335 --> 03:38:37.137
LAND. REALLY HITTING HOME THE

03:38:37.204 --> 03:38:38.572
POINT OF HOW MUCH WORK WE HAVE

03:38:38.638 --> 03:38:40.040
TO DO TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AND

03:38:40.106 --> 03:38:41.074
THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE

03:38:41.141 --> 03:38:43.143
SYSTEMS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

03:38:43.210 --> 03:38:45.145
HERE TO TALK ABOUT. BUT WE HAVE

03:38:45.212 --> 03:38:46.546
A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. I

03:38:46.613 --> 03:38:48.014
WOULDN'T REALLY ONE THING WHICH

03:38:48.081 --> 03:38:50.116
IS THE WORK OF CHIEF TO HOT AT

03:38:50.183 --> 03:38:51.651
IN EMERYVILLE ON TRAINING

03:38:51.718 --> 03:38:53.520
RELATED TO MINDFULNESS I THINK

03:38:53.587 --> 03:38:55.155
THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS.

03:38:55.222 --> 03:38:56.323
TOO OFTEN DISMISSED SHE'S DONE

03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:57.991
INCREDIBLE WORK FOCUSED ON HOW

03:38:58.058 --> 03:38:59.759
DO WE GET POLICE OFFICERS. IN

03:38:59.826 --> 03:39:01.061
THE MOMENT TO MAKE THE RIGHT

03:39:01.127 --> 03:39:02.262
DECISIONS IN WHAT IS THAT

03:39:02.329 --> 03:39:03.363
TRAINING LOOK LIKE ON AN

03:39:03.430 --> 03:39:04.598
EVERYDAY BASIS I THINK WE NEED

03:39:04.664 --> 03:39:06.366
MORE. CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE

03:39:06.433 --> 03:39:07.634
SOLUTIONS AROUND TRAINING THAT

03:39:07.701 --> 03:39:08.635
WILL CHANGE THE CULTURE AND I

03:39:08.702 --> 03:39:09.436
THINK SHE'S BEEN AT THE

03:39:09.503 --> 03:39:10.537
FOREFRONT OF THAT WORK AND

03:39:10.604 --> 03:39:11.571
HOPEFULLY SHE- I KNOW SHE

03:39:11.638 --> 03:39:12.706
RETIRED FROM THE EMERYVILLE

03:39:12.772 --> 03:39:13.840
POLICE PART BUT I KNOW SHE

03:39:13.907 --> 03:39:14.808
CONTINUES TO BE IN THESE

03:39:14.875 --> 03:39:16.309
CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK IT'S

03:39:16.376 --> 03:39:17.310
IMPORTANT THAT WE LEFT UP.

03:39:17.377 --> 03:39:18.979
DIFFERENT AND NEW VOICES ABOUT

03:39:19.045 --> 03:39:19.880
WHAT OUR POLICE TRAINING SHOULD

03:39:19.946 --> 03:39:22.949
LOOK LIKE- MY QUESTION THOUGH.

03:39:23.016 --> 03:39:24.584
FOR THE PANELISTS IS TO ADDRESS

03:39:24.651 --> 03:39:25.986
THE QUESTION WE HEARD. IN THE

03:39:26.052 --> 03:39:27.287
FIRST PANEL WHICH IS THAT THERE

03:39:27.354 --> 03:39:29.222
ARE PIECES OF THE TRAINING.

03:39:29.289 --> 03:39:31.625
THAT LEAD TO DISQUALIFICATION.

03:39:31.691 --> 03:39:33.059
OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN

03:39:33.126 --> 03:39:34.427
DISPROPORTIONATELY RIGHT THEY

03:39:34.494 --> 03:39:37.130
HIGHLIGHTED AND- SHOOTING. AND

03:39:37.197 --> 03:39:39.232
DRIVING IS THE TWO KEY ELEMENTS

03:39:39.299 --> 03:39:40.133
THE TWO DEPARTMENTS THEIR

03:39:40.200 --> 03:39:41.768
ONLINE BOTH SAN FRANCISCO AND

03:39:41.835 --> 03:39:43.403
SACRAMENTO TALKED ABOUT. THEIR

03:39:43.470 --> 03:39:45.071
OWN WORK TO ADDRESS THAT

03:39:45.138 --> 03:39:47.240
LOCALLY. BUT CLEARLY THIS NEEDS

03:39:47.307 --> 03:39:48.375
TO CHANGE AT THE STATE LEVEL

03:39:48.441 --> 03:39:50.710
SHOULD WE TALK A LITTLE BIT

03:39:50.777 --> 03:39:51.244
ABOUT WHAT POST IS DONE TO

03:39:51.311 --> 03:39:56.683
ADDRESS THIS. MISTER ARBORISTS

FROM POST WE LIKE TO TAKE THAT

03:39:58.885 --> 03:40:04.758
QUESTION TO STAY WITH US. SO WE

03:40:04.824 --> 03:40:08.828
DID AN ANALYSIS IN TWENTY

03:40:08.895 --> 03:40:09.429
NINETEEN SO YOUR RATES AT THE

03:40:09.496 --> 03:40:11.298
ACADEMY AND THE FAILURE RATES

03:40:11.364 --> 03:40:15.201
WERE NOT BASED ON. OUR SIX- I'M

03:40:15.268 --> 03:40:17.270
SORRY CHECK- OR RACE OR

03:40:17.337 --> 03:40:19.172
ETHNICITY THE FAILURE RATE WAS

03:40:19.239 --> 03:40:21.141
APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE CABIN

03:40:21.207 --> 03:40:22.342
RECRUITER CAN DEBTS WERE

03:40:22.409 --> 03:40:23.643
FAILING OUT OF THE ACADEMY AT

SELF DISMISSALS AND 5% WERE

03:40:29.616 --> 03:40:30.717
ACTUALLY FIELD TESTS.

03:40:30.784 --> 03:40:32.118
PREDOMINANT AREAS IF THEY ARE

03:40:32.185 --> 03:40:35.121
FAILING IS A FIREARMS TRAINING

03:40:35.188 --> 03:40:38.091

THAT TIME WE ARE CONDUCTING

03:40:48.768 --> 03:40:51.137
THAT STUDY- THE ACADEMIES ARE

03:40:51.204 --> 03:40:53.073

THE DIFFERENT ACADEMIES NEED

03:41:01.281 --> 03:41:02.515
FOR REMEDIATION FOR PROPER

03:41:02.582 --> 03:41:04.351
REMEDIATION FOR THOSE

03:41:04.417 --> 03:41:06.786
INDIVIDUALS ARE LEARNED SKILLS

ARE LESS PEOPLE. FAILING OUT

03:41:13.426 --> 03:41:15.228

POST CERTIFICATION ACADEMY. SO

03:42:06.713 --> 03:42:08.114
THE QUESTION IS TO WHAT EXTENT

03:42:08.181 --> 03:42:09.649
ARE EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT

03:42:09.716 --> 03:42:11.251
ACADEMIES INSTILLING A SENSE OF

03:42:11.317 --> 03:42:14.354
DEDICATION TO THE COMMUNITY AND

TAKE THAT QUESTION. SURE SO THE-

03:42:33.673 --> 03:42:36.042
EVERY EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE

03:42:36.109 --> 03:42:37.110
ACADEMY I BELIEVE THERE'S

03:42:37.177 --> 03:42:39.546
APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN OF THE

03:42:39.612 --> 03:42:40.914
FORTY ONE POLICE ACADEMIES OUR

03:42:40.980 --> 03:42:43.583
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHINESE ARE

03:42:43.650 --> 03:42:44.684
REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ADVISORY

03:42:44.751 --> 03:42:46.753
BOARD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:42:46.820 --> 03:42:48.722
PERSONNEL AND OTHERS THEY

03:42:48.788 --> 03:42:50.557
PROVIDE THEM CAN PUT ON WITH

03:42:50.623 --> 03:42:52.225
THEIR LOCAL MEATS ARE FOR THEIR

03:42:52.292 --> 03:42:54.594
COMMUNITY- THAT ALLOWS THEM TO

03:42:54.661 --> 03:42:56.830
TAILOR THE TRAINING TO THOSE

03:42:56.896 --> 03:42:58.631
AGENCIES THAT THEY'RE SERVING

03:42:58.698 --> 03:43:02.936
OUR- EACH ACADEMIES. IS WRITTEN.

03:43:03.002 --> 03:43:04.938
PROVIDE STANDARDIZED TRAINING

03:43:05.004 --> 03:43:08.475
BUT THEY ALSO- HAVE THE ABILITY

03:43:08.541 --> 03:43:10.376
TO MODIFY THE TRAINING IN

03:43:10.443 --> 03:43:12.245
CERTAIN AREAS FOR THEIR LOCAL

03:43:12.312 --> 03:43:13.213
COMMITTEE I GIVE YOU AN

03:43:13.279 --> 03:43:16.950
EXAMPLE- LET'S SEE AN ACADEMY

03:43:17.016 --> 03:43:21.888
AND- COLLEGES THERE- SISKIYOU

03:43:21.955 --> 03:43:26.259
IN- INVERNESS COUNTY. THEY DO

03:43:26.326 --> 03:43:28.228
NOT HAVE VERY MUCH OF AN URBAN

03:43:28.294 --> 03:43:30.263
ENVIRONMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITY

03:43:30.330 --> 03:43:32.132
AND THEIR DRIVING MAYBE OFF

03:43:32.198 --> 03:43:34.901
ROAD TYPE OF DRIVING- THEY MAY

03:43:34.968 --> 03:43:37.971
INCLUDE- DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF

03:43:38.037 --> 03:43:42.542
DEALING WITH A WORLD. HE DOES

03:43:42.609 --> 03:43:43.877
NOT THEY DON'T DO OFF ROAD

03:43:43.943 --> 03:43:46.212
DRIVING ITS URBAN DRIVING IT'S

03:43:46.279 --> 03:43:48.982
A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF-

03:43:49.048 --> 03:43:51.918
TRAINING SO WE DO GIVE THEM THE

03:43:51.985 --> 03:43:56.022
OPPORTUNITY TO- TO CHANGE HOW

03:43:56.089 --> 03:43:58.057
THEY ARE. HOW THEY DO THEIR

03:43:58.124 --> 03:43:59.759
ECONOMY AS LONG AS THEY MEET

03:43:59.826 --> 03:44:01.427
THE MINIMUM STANDARDS. I THINK

03:44:01.494 --> 03:44:04.130
SOME AREAS THAT. COULD

03:44:04.197 --> 03:44:06.366
POTENTIALLY IMPROVE THE ACADEMY

03:44:06.432 --> 03:44:08.234
AND I GUESS THIS IS MORE OF A

03:44:08.301 --> 03:44:12.005
CHALLENGE- CRITICISM GAS BUT AT

03:44:12.071 --> 03:44:14.541
TIMES WE TEND TO SHOW OF

03:44:14.607 --> 03:44:15.308
EVERYTHING INTO THE BASIC

03:44:15.375 --> 03:44:17.877
ECONOMY. AND THE BASIC ACADEMY

03:44:17.944 --> 03:44:21.915
IS THE BASIC ACADEMY WE TEND TO

03:44:21.981 --> 03:44:23.583
SHOVE THINGS INTO THE ACADEMY

03:44:23.650 --> 03:44:27.086
OFFICER IS NOT GOING TO.

03:44:27.153 --> 03:44:28.822
NECESSARILY HAVE TO DEAL WITH

03:44:28.888 --> 03:44:29.789
FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE

03:44:29.856 --> 03:44:31.691
YEARS OF THEIR CAREER AS A

03:44:31.758 --> 03:44:33.459
PEACE OFFICER AND THERE WOULD

03:44:33.526 --> 03:44:35.662
BE. I THINK BUT ARE TOO USED TO

03:44:35.728 --> 03:44:36.796
REMOVE SOME OF THAT'S EVERY

03:44:36.863 --> 03:44:38.965
ATOM. AND PROVIDED AT A LATER

03:44:39.032 --> 03:44:40.300
TIME REGARDLESS IF IT'S

03:44:40.366 --> 03:44:42.268
MANDATED ARE NOT MANDATED BUT

03:44:42.335 --> 03:44:44.170
SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE TO SHOVE

03:44:44.237 --> 03:44:45.939
IT ALL INTO THE ACADEMY. AND

03:44:46.005 --> 03:44:47.373
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE BEST

03:44:47.440 --> 03:44:49.108
PLACE FOR IT THAT WOULD BE THE

03:44:49.175 --> 03:44:55.315
ONE- THE ONE THING THAT. I

03:44:55.381 --> 03:44:57.283
WOULD. YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY- TO

03:44:57.350 --> 03:44:58.117
YOU ALL IS A CONSIDERATION

03:44:58.184 --> 03:45:01.154
FUTURE MANDATE TRAINING- EACH

03:45:01.221 --> 03:45:02.555
OTHER AREAS AND I THINK IT WAS

03:45:02.622 --> 03:45:05.725
IT WAS DISCUSSED. IN GREAT

03:45:05.792 --> 03:45:06.559
DETAIL ABOUT FIREARMS AN EVIL

03:45:06.626 --> 03:45:08.828
ACT. THE KID YOUNG YOUNG PEOPLE

03:45:08.895 --> 03:45:10.063
THESE DAYS ARE PROPER NOT

03:45:10.129 --> 03:45:12.265
LINING UP THE DMV UNDER

03:45:12.332 --> 03:45:12.899
SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY TO GET THEIR

03:45:12.966 --> 03:45:14.400
DRIVER'S LICENSE. WHEN THEY

03:45:14.467 --> 03:45:20.573
SHOW UP TO- TO THE ACADEMY. NOT

03:45:20.640 --> 03:45:23.042
AT GROUND ZERO BUT PERHAPS-

03:45:23.109 --> 03:45:24.010
EIGHT ZERO BUT PERHAPS NEGATIVE

03:45:24.077 --> 03:45:27.080
THREE- THE ACADEMY IS CLOSED BE

03:45:27.146 --> 03:45:29.115
ABLE TO TAKE THEM FROM ZERO TO

03:45:29.182 --> 03:45:30.650
GRADUATION BUT IF THEY'RE

03:45:30.717 --> 03:45:33.353
ALREADY IN A DEFICIT- SOMETIMES

03:45:33.419 --> 03:45:34.654
IT'S HARD TO GET THEM TO CATCH

03:45:34.721 --> 03:45:36.923
UP SO THERE ARE AREAS THAT

03:45:36.990 --> 03:45:37.924
PERHAPS WE CAN ADD ADDITIONAL

03:45:37.991 --> 03:45:40.493

03:48:06.939 --> 03:48:09.275
THEM MAY NOT BE NECESSARY FOR

03:48:09.342 --> 03:48:11.878
THE REAL HARM DOES- ACADEMY

03:48:11.944 --> 03:48:13.546
ALREADY WE ARE GOING TO COLLEGE

03:48:13.613 --> 03:48:15.982
ACADEMY OR PERHAPS L. A. P. YOU

03:48:16.049 --> 03:48:17.750
CAN RECEIVE DATA SHARES THEY

03:48:17.817 --> 03:48:19.619
MAY NOT REQUIRE THAT LEVEL OF

03:48:19.685 --> 03:48:21.954
TRAINING SO I THINK SETTING THE

03:48:22.021 --> 03:48:23.189
MINIMUM STANDARDS IS THE

03:48:23.256 --> 03:48:24.090
WAITING I DON'T KNOW WHAT A

03:48:24.157 --> 03:48:25.358
MINIMUM STANDARDS SHOULD BE

03:48:25.425 --> 03:48:26.192
RAISED IS A DIFFERENT

03:48:26.259 --> 03:48:28.995
DISCUSSION BUT BEING ABLE TO

03:48:29.062 --> 03:48:31.998
TAILOR THE CURRICULUM I THINK

03:48:32.065 --> 03:48:35.068
IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT- HE SAID

03:48:35.134 --> 03:48:36.469
YEAH COLLEGE OF THE REDWOODS

03:48:36.536 --> 03:48:37.470
THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION

03:48:37.537 --> 03:48:41.574
ABOUT- CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND-

03:48:41.641 --> 03:48:43.676
ADDRESSING- THE NATIVE

03:48:43.743 --> 03:48:45.478
AMERICAN. COMMUNITY AND WORKING

03:48:45.545 --> 03:48:46.712
WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN

03:48:46.779 --> 03:48:51.117
COMMUNITY- THEY- THE RESULT

03:48:51.184 --> 03:48:52.885
RISK PART OF THAT COMMUNITY

03:48:52.952 --> 03:48:55.388
EIGHT IN- IN ORDER TO. THAT

03:48:55.455 --> 03:48:58.458
MAIN BE. THE BEST TRAINING FOR

03:48:58.524 --> 03:49:00.693
LAPD IT MAY NOT BE I MEAN IT

03:49:00.760 --> 03:49:03.029
MAY NOT BE BAD TREATING BUT-

03:49:03.096 --> 03:49:04.831
THEY MAY WANT TO TAILOR IT TO

03:49:04.897 --> 03:49:06.933
SOME OTHER. OTHERCOMMUNITY

03:49:06.999 --> 03:49:09.769
THAT IS- MORE PREDOMINATE IN

03:49:09.836 --> 03:49:14.207
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- STERN-

03:49:14.273 --> 03:49:15.808
SO ACADEMIES DO LANGUAGE

03:49:15.875 --> 03:49:19.312
TRADING I BELIEVE SOMETHING

03:49:19.378 --> 03:49:20.480
SPANISH LANGUAGE TRAINING. WELL

03:49:20.546 --> 03:49:21.447
IN YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT-

03:49:21.514 --> 03:49:22.949
FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT WANTS

03:49:23.015 --> 03:49:25.251
TO DO- LANGUAGE TRAINING IN A

03:49:25.318 --> 03:49:26.886
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE SUCH AS- YOU

03:49:26.953 --> 03:49:29.689
KNOW. WHATEVER IT MAY BE I

03:49:29.755 --> 03:49:30.857
THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT

03:49:30.923 --> 03:49:32.058
OPPORTUNITY SO I THINK IT'S

03:49:32.125 --> 03:49:34.026
GOOD TO HAVE MINIMUM STANDARDS

03:49:34.093 --> 03:49:35.528
AND LET THEM TAKE RIGHT THAT'S

03:49:35.595 --> 03:49:37.163

03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:51.811
TRAINING HIGHLIGHTS THE

03:49:51.878 --> 03:49:54.013
IMPORTANCE OF TRUST BETWEEN LAW

03:49:54.080 --> 03:49:56.015
ENFORCEMENT AND CIVILIAN AND

03:49:56.082 --> 03:49:58.651
LET ME- UP REPEAT THE QUESTION

03:49:58.718 --> 03:49:59.519
AGAIN AND THEN I'LL MAKE A

03:49:59.585 --> 03:50:01.020
COMMENT DOES TRAINING

03:50:01.087 --> 03:50:02.655
HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:50:02.722 --> 03:50:05.558
TRUST. BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:50:05.625 --> 03:50:07.126
AND CIVILIANS OR THAT OR THE

03:50:07.193 --> 03:50:10.696
COMMUNITY- AND SO WHEN I WAS IN

03:50:10.763 --> 03:50:13.766
THE CITY OF MAY WOULD- CALL OLD

03:50:13.833 --> 03:50:14.901
SCHOOL WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL

03:50:14.967 --> 03:50:18.871

03:50:28.781 --> 03:50:30.149
RODRIGUEZ FAMILY AND I KNEW

03:50:30.216 --> 03:50:31.250

THAT WHAT ON BOTH SIDES WHEN I

03:50:41.761 --> 03:50:43.696
WAS THERE. SO AGAIN THE

03:50:43.763 --> 03:50:44.964
QUESTION IS DOES THE TRAINING

03:52:37.276 --> 03:52:39.178

WHAT FROM YOUR LANDS TO MAKE- A

03:53:02.268 --> 03:53:04.737
REIMAGINING LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:53:04.804 --> 03:53:06.138
CALIFORNIA DOES THAT MAKE SENSE.

03:53:06.205 --> 03:53:09.308
SO IF I MAY REAL QUICK I ALSO

CERTIFICATION TRAINING UP. THAT

03:53:14.580 --> 03:53:17.683
I RECEIVED OUT AT THE ACADEMY-

03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:20.086
SO JUST FOR A LITTLE CLARITY ON

03:53:20.152 --> 03:53:22.455
YOUR QUESTION ARE YOU ASKING MY

03:53:22.521 --> 03:53:24.523
OPINION FROM A LEGISLATIVE

03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:28.227
PERSPECTIVE OR FROM AN OVERALL

03:53:28.294 --> 03:53:30.663
COMMUNITY. YEAH COMMITTEE

03:53:30.730 --> 03:53:34.600
PERSPECTIVE PLEASE SO- NUMBER

03:53:34.667 --> 03:53:35.801
ONE I THINK THAT WE MUST BE

03:53:35.868 --> 03:53:38.404
COGNITIVE AND AWARE OF THE TRUE

03:53:38.471 --> 03:53:41.173
HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY MMHM

03:53:41.240 --> 03:53:44.276
RELATED TO RACE RELATIONS AND

03:53:44.343 --> 03:53:47.847
HOW IT IMPACTS LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:53:47.913 --> 03:53:52.017
NUMBER TWO THAT WE MUST BEGIN

03:53:52.084 --> 03:53:53.986
TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE

03:53:54.053 --> 03:53:57.223
US VERSUS THEM MENTALITY THAT

03:53:57.289 --> 03:54:02.561
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO. OTHER

03:54:02.628 --> 03:54:04.263
ONE ANOTHER THAT IT IS LAW

03:54:04.330 --> 03:54:06.132
ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AND THEN

03:54:06.198 --> 03:54:07.633
THERE IS THE CIVILIAN

03:54:07.700 --> 03:54:10.736
COMMUNITY- BECAUSE WITHIN THAT

03:54:10.803 --> 03:54:11.737
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT

03:54:11.804 --> 03:54:13.839
COMMUNITIES THERE'S THE AFRICAN

03:54:13.906 --> 03:54:15.741
AMERICAN LATINO AND OR

03:54:15.808 --> 03:54:18.043
IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITY AND THEN

03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:20.146
THERE IS THE WHITE COMMUNITY-

03:54:20.212 --> 03:54:22.915
AND SO WE MUST BE MINDFUL THAT.

03:54:22.982 --> 03:54:24.350
A LOT OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING

03:54:24.417 --> 03:54:27.453
ABOUT THE ROOT OF IT ALL IS OUR

03:54:27.520 --> 03:54:29.655
BONDING AGENT OF HUMANITY THAT

03:54:29.722 --> 03:54:31.791
WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND

03:54:31.857 --> 03:54:34.527
ONCE WE CAN BEGIN TO SHAPE THE

03:54:34.593 --> 03:54:36.695
LANGUAGE. THAT HELPS TO

03:54:36.762 --> 03:54:38.597
FORMULATE THE THOUGHT PROCESSES

03:54:38.664 --> 03:54:39.899
THAT CHANGES THE OVERALL

03:54:39.965 --> 03:54:44.370
PERCEPTION THAT WE ARE ALL. ONE

03:54:44.437 --> 03:54:47.706
HUMAN RACE- I THINK THAT WE'RE

03:54:47.773 --> 03:54:48.974
GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE

03:54:49.041 --> 03:54:50.476
PROBLEMS AND SO WE CAN CONTINUE

03:54:50.543 --> 03:54:51.610
TO GO ROUND AND ROUND AND HAVE

03:54:51.677 --> 03:54:52.678
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE

03:54:52.745 --> 03:54:54.914
NECESSITY FOR POLICE REFORM BUT

03:54:54.980 --> 03:54:57.316
AGAIN AS I SAID- SOME OF THESE

03:54:57.383 --> 03:54:58.551
THINGS DON'T NEED TO BE

03:54:58.617 --> 03:54:59.752
REFORMED THEY NEED TO BE

03:54:59.819 --> 03:55:02.154
DECONSTRUCTED. AND THEY NEED TO

03:55:02.221 --> 03:55:04.824
BE RECONSTRUCTED INTO A SYSTEM

03:55:04.890 --> 03:55:06.926
THAT IS MORE INCLUSIVE OF

03:55:06.992 --> 03:55:09.762
EVERYONE- AND WE CANNOT FORGET

03:55:09.829 --> 03:55:12.298
THE FACT THAT- WE S. PEOPLE OF

03:55:12.364 --> 03:55:14.967
COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN

03:55:15.034 --> 03:55:17.336
RELEGATED TO THE DARK CORNERS

03:55:17.403 --> 03:55:19.905
OF BEING CRIMINALIZED BASED ON

03:55:19.972 --> 03:55:22.408
OUR MERE EXISTENCE IN THIS

03:55:22.475 --> 03:55:25.578
SOCIO ECONOMIC SOCIETY THAT A

03:55:25.644 --> 03:55:27.313
LOT OF WHAT WE DEAL WITH HAS

03:55:27.379 --> 03:55:29.048
BEEN SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED TO BE

03:55:29.114 --> 03:55:31.417
THAT WAY. AND THE MINDSETS OF

03:55:31.484 --> 03:55:33.452
THE PEOPLE NEED TO BE RE SHAPED

03:55:33.519 --> 03:55:35.421
AND RE FASHION TO UNDERSTAND

03:55:35.488 --> 03:55:38.424
THAT A PART OF THAT IS BEING

03:55:38.491 --> 03:55:41.360
INCLUSIVE OF ON ITS HISTORY.

03:55:41.427 --> 03:55:43.796
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE

ENFORCEMENT SO I'M GLAD TO BE A

04:04:12.404 --> 04:04:16.208
PART OF THIS TOPIC- I KNOW THAT

04:04:16.274 --> 04:04:16.808
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A IT'S A

04:04:16.875 --> 04:04:18.143

04:04:18.210 --> 04:04:19.544

KNOW WITH RESPECT NOT TO BE

04:04:24.316 --> 04:04:27.452
DISRESPECTFUL OR ANYTHING- BUT-

04:04:27.519 --> 04:04:30.022
IN REGARDS TO THE- EDUCATION

04:04:30.088 --> 04:04:32.357
PIECE AND THE TRAINING PIECE-

04:04:32.424 --> 04:04:33.425
BEING A WAY TO BUILD TRUST

04:04:33.492 --> 04:04:34.960
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

04:04:35.027 --> 04:04:36.995
COMMUNITY. I DON'T THINK THAT

04:04:37.062 --> 04:04:38.030
THAT IS THE ANSWER ALTHOUGH

04:04:38.096 --> 04:04:39.231
EDUCATION IS GOOD AND SHOULD

04:04:39.297 --> 04:04:41.299
ALWAYS BE ENCOURAGED. YOU KNOW

04:04:41.366 --> 04:04:43.568
IT'S ALL ABSOLUTELY ENCOURAGED-

04:04:43.635 --> 04:04:44.736
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER

04:04:44.803 --> 04:04:45.404
I THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS

04:04:45.470 --> 04:04:47.639
ACCOUNTABILITY OF OUR LAW

04:04:47.706 --> 04:04:48.840
ENFORCEMENT AND OUR CIVILIANS

04:04:48.907 --> 04:04:51.476
ALIKE. IF THERE IS YOU KNOW IF

04:04:51.543 --> 04:04:53.011
A LAW WAS BROKEN OR EXCESSIVE

04:04:53.078 --> 04:04:54.880
FORCE IS USED. THEY SHOULD BE

04:04:54.946 --> 04:04:56.014
HELD ACCOUNTABLE SO I THINK

04:04:56.081 --> 04:04:57.516
ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE FIRST

04:04:57.582 --> 04:04:58.784
THING THAT WILL BUILD TRUST

04:04:58.850 --> 04:04:59.918
WITH THE COMMUNITY AND LAW

04:04:59.985 --> 04:05:01.987
ENFORCEMENT SECOND IS GETTING

04:05:02.054 --> 04:05:04.856
TO KNOW US GETTING FINALISED-

04:05:04.923 --> 04:05:05.957
BECAUSE THERE IS A DISCONNECT

04:05:06.024 --> 04:05:08.460
RIGHT NOW. AND AS OF RIGHT NOW

04:05:08.527 --> 04:05:10.262
IF YOU DON'T KNOW SOMEBODY. YOU

04:05:10.328 --> 04:05:11.263
DON'T KNOW YOUR COMMUNITY

04:05:11.329 --> 04:05:12.631
YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO ACTUALLY

04:05:12.697 --> 04:05:14.266
PROTECT AND TO SERVE THEM IF

04:05:14.332 --> 04:05:15.767
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEIR

04:05:15.834 --> 04:05:18.437
NEEDS ARE- AND AGAIN IT CREATES

04:05:18.503 --> 04:05:19.638
THE US VERSUS THEM MENTALITY

04:05:19.704 --> 04:05:21.907
BECAUSE YOU FEAR. WHAT OR WHO

04:05:21.973 --> 04:05:23.675
YOU DON'T KNOW SO I THINK

04:05:23.742 --> 04:05:25.610
THAT'S NEEDS IT THAT'S KEY.

04:05:25.677 --> 04:05:30.115
ALSO- WITH THE EDUCATIONAL

04:05:30.182 --> 04:05:32.584
PIECE REQUIREMENT IT CAN. MAKE

04:05:32.651 --> 04:05:34.319
IT HARDER FOR MINORITIES TO

04:05:34.386 --> 04:05:35.587
MOVE UP THE SOCIAL MOBILITY

04:05:35.654 --> 04:05:37.489
LADDER SO I THINK THAT'S

04:05:37.556 --> 04:05:39.224
ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'RE NOT

04:05:39.291 --> 04:05:41.560
MAKING IT A REQUIREMENT- BUT I

04:05:41.626 --> 04:05:42.828
DO LIKE THE TWO YEARS THAT YOU

04:05:45.130 --> 04:05:48.633
AND THAT THE AGENT CREASE-

04:05:48.700 --> 04:05:49.835
ANOTHER THING SUGGESTION THAT I

04:05:49.901 --> 04:05:53.105
HAVE FOR OUR AFFECT PD. AND

04:05:53.171 --> 04:05:53.972
