OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHERE WILL HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT THE STATE HAS DEDICATED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS IN NEW HOUSING.

GOOD MORNING MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TO PRESENT AB EIGHTY NINE THE PEACE OFFICER EDUCATION AND AGE CONDITIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT AT OR THE PEACE THAT RELYING ON DECADES OF DATA SHOWCASING MARC MATURE AND BETTER EDUCATED OFFICERS ARE LESS RELIANT ON EXCESSIVE FORCE THE PIECE THAT WILL INCREASE THE CURRENT MINIMUM EDUCATION AND H. STANDARDS FOR ALL NEW CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS I'VE HAD A ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND I HAD AND I'VE HAD HEARD THE CONCERNS REGARDING THE IMPACT THIS BILL MAY HAVE ON THE RECRUITMENT POOL ESPECIALLY ON RECRUITS OF COLOR. IN RESPONSE I AM WORKING WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO WHO AUTHORED A SIMILAR BILL AND THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION TO CRAFT A COMPREHENSIVE COMMONSENSE. POLICE REFORM BILL. IN ADDITION AS AN AFRICAN. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A PEACE OFFICER. THE PIECE THAT WILL BE AMENDED IN THE SENATE BECAUSE OF THE COLLABORATION MISTER PORTANTINO I MYSELF MAY AS THE AUTHOR MISTER PORTANTINO WILL BE THE PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR. SO THAT WE CAN MERGE BOTH BILLS THAT COMBINES BOTH H. ND EDUCATION TOGETHER IN ADDITION MAKING THE AGE PART MUCH MORE ROBUST. THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE. ADD A DELAY IN. FOR POST TO CREATE A LAW FORCED A SOCIAL DEGREE AS WELL AS RAISE THE AGE REQUIREMENTS TO TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD TO ALIGN WITH THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. ONCE IMPLEMENTED ALL CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICER CANDIDATES MUST BE TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND OBTAIN NEITHER EITHER AT THE NEWLY CREATED LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATES DEGREE. OR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN THE DISCIPLINE OF THEIR STUDENT WITH ONE OF THE BEST TUITION FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS IN THE NATION LAW ENFORCEMENT A WILL BE CALM AND ACCESSIBLE OPTION TOWARD A CAREER IN POLICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST DIVERSE. HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT POPULATION. WHILE THE DUTIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER TIME THEIR ENTRY QUALIFICATIONS HAVE FAILED TO EVOLVE TO MEET THE CURRENT DEMANDS OF THE JOB. WHEN ELEVATED EDUCATION ENTREAT STANDARDS ARE EXPECTED OF OUR EDUCATORS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE ALSO DEMAND ARREST. THE BIT THAT DEMAND THE BEST OF OUR PEACE OFFICERS IMPROVING CONDITIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT WILL STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY ESPECIALLY FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. OF COLOR WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY FALL VICTIM TO EXCESSIVE FORCE AT THE HANDS OF POLICE OFFICERS AS WE MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD. I REMAIN COMMITTED. TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKE HOLD. IN THE ONES THAT ARE NOT FAMILIAR. WITH THE DEAL THAT HAVE BEEN STRUCK. VERY RECENTLY BOB WITH THE PEACE OFFICERS AND ALSO IN THIS. DISCUSSION PORAC. SO THAT WE MOVE THIS FOR ENDING. THE BILL THAT HOPEFULLY EVERYONE WILL BE PROUD OF THEIR CAN MOVE FOR. AS WE MOVE THIS. AGAIN IF THIS FOR I COMMITTEE. TO NOT ONLY WITH THE PEOPLE. I'VE ALREADY STRUCK A DEALWITH BUT PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO DON'T DON'T KNOW ALL THE DEEP DEAL POINTS RIGHT NOW WITH THE SHERIFF'S. OR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT WE WILL CONTINUE. I REPEAT WILL CONTINUE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO ALL WORK TOGETHER. BOB PASSING IN PASSING IS TIMELY AN OVERDUE THE PEACE ACT WILL PROFESSIONALISE AND TRANSFORM DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE MARKETER TRANSITION IN ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES BEHIND EXCESSIVE FORCE.

MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR LATINO CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL WHEN A SERVICE CONTRACT IS TERMINATED EXISTING LAW GIVES TWENTY YEAR EXISTING OFF FROM TWENTY YEARS AGO UNDER THE DISPLACED JANITOR OPPORTUNITY ACT PROVIDES JANITORIAL AND BUILDING. MAINTENANCE SERVICE WORKERS THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE WORKING UNDER NEW CONTRACTOR FOR A SIXTY DAY TRANSITION PERIOD. AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR MAKES A NARROW CHANGE BY SIMPLY ADDING SIMILARES SIMILARITY SITUATED HOTEL WORKERS WHO PROVIDE FOOD AND CLEAN SERVICES UNDER A CONTRACTOR TO THIS EXISTING LAW. THE LAW ONLY APPLIES IF THE NEW CONTRACTOR HAS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES IN THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT TO BE CLEAR EXISTING LAW AND THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE NEW CONTRACTOR KEEP HOTEL WORKERS ON BOARD IF THEY HAD A- PERFORMANCE OR CONDUCT ISSUE AT WORK. OR THE NEW CONTRACTOR SIMPLY DOES NOT NEED ALL THE WORKERS TO PERFORM THE SERVICES UNDER THE CONTRACT. THIS BILL TARGETS A LOW WAGE WORKFORCE MADE UP OF PREDOMINANTLY LATINO AND IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR MINIMIZES THE MEDIA DISPLACEMENT OF ALL WORKERS IMPACTED WHEN HOTELS TREATING SERVICE CONTRACTORS AND ENSURES THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE TIME FOR TRANSITION. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS GONZALEZ. MISTER FLORES YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR- FOR ONE OF VERY IMPORTANT REASON AND- IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED THROUGH THE HOTEL INDUSTRY THROUGH THE LAST YEAR OF THIS PANDEMIC THEY HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED. WE'VE ASKED THEM TO SHUT DOWN. WE'VE ASKED THEM TO EMPLOY. IN HOUSE ALMOST PEOPLE THEY'VE BEEN A PARTNER. WITH KOBE NINETEEN THROUGH THIS ENTIRE YEAR AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR. DOES ONE THING IT HAMPERS THEIR ABILITY TO RE OPEN. COMING FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE IF WE HAVE TO TRACK DOWN AN EMPLOYEE GIVE THEM TWO WEEKS. THEY'RE GONNA BE STAYING AT HOME. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COLLECT UNEMPLOYMENT. MEANWHILE THE BUSINESSES REMAINING SHUT DOWN BECAUSE BY LAW WE'RE MANDATING HOW THEY RE OPEN. I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE PROJECT OF OR THE JOB OF THIS LEGISLATOR TO DICTATE HOW PRIVATE BUSINESSES REOPEN. WE NEED TO GET OUR EMPLOYEES BACK TO WORK. AND THE ONES THAT WANT TO GET BACK TO WORK ARE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR READY TO GO. THE READY TO WORK NOW THE ONES THAT ARE STILL COLLECTING UNEMPLOYMENT DON'T REALLY WANT TO GET BACK TO WORK IN A LOT OF REASONS FOR A LOT OF REASONS SO I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE.

THERE ARE HOTELS THAT DON'T DIRECTLY EMPLOY THEIR HOUSEKEEPERS AND FOOD SERVICE WORKERS AND THEY HAVE A CONTRACTOR COME IN TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES MISTER SAYS THEY CAN'T KEEP SWITCHING CONTRACTORS TO GET RID OF- WORKERS FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE THEY'RE FORMING A UNION AND THEY DON'T LIKE THAT- IN IT JUST PROVIDES THOSE WORKERS A CHANCE TO PROVE THEMSELVES TO NEW CONTRACTOR HOWEVER IF THE NEW CONTRACTOR NEEDS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WORKERS OR OR- THERE'S PEOPLE WHO CAN BE FIRED FOR BECAUSE I ALLOWS THEM TO DO THAT AS WELL THIS IS NOT. I'M IN ANY WAY DEALING WITH THE IMMEDIATE RE OPENING OF HOTELS THIS IS THE CAR THAT BASICALLY WHAT WE HAVE FOR JANITORS IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR TWENTY YEARS IT HAS NOT PUT JANITORIAL CONTRACTORS OUT OF WORK THIS IS THE SAME THING FOR THOSE SIMILARLY SITUATED SERVICE WORKERS IN HOTELS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE ABOUT.

FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR CORRECT SOME PEOPLE FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AND OTHERS NOT CLEAN SOLID WASTE MISTER BLOOM EMAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT ALONG WITH- MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LONG BEACH A. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR TO IMMEDIATELY AND COMPREHENSIVELY MODERNIZE THE CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING LAW I THINK IT'S WELL UNDERSTOOD ON THIS FLOOR THAT THE BOTTLE BILL IS IN NEED OF ATTENTION STATUTORY CONSTRAINTS OF LIMITED RECYCLING PAYMENTS AT A TIME WHEN GLOBAL SCRAP PRICES HAVE DECLINED AND THESE TWO BLACK ONE TO FINANCIAL PLEDGES HAVE. RESULTED IN THE CLOSURE OF MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS LEAVING MANY COMMUNITIES WITH FEW IF ANY REMAINING CENTERS FOR EXAMPLE MY DISTRICT HAS JUST ONE REMAINING RECYCLING CENTER. WITH THE CLOSURE OF RECYCLING CENTERS HAS COME A DROP IN THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING RATE FROM 80% AS RECENTLY AS TWENTY SIXTEEN TO LESS THAN SEVENTY PERCENT. IN TWENTY TWENTY THIS IS THE WRONG DIRECTION IN AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR UPDATES PROGRAM RULES TO SUPPORT EXPANDED AND INNOVATIVE RECYCLING OPTIONS. WHILE REINVESTING MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN UNREDEEMED FUNDS TO PROVIDE TARGETED INCENTIVES FOR LOW VOLUME COMMUNITY BASED RECYCLING CENTERS ACROSS THESTATE. IT INCREASES FUNDING FOR RURAL RECYCLING CENTERS TO OFFSET HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS. AND IT PROVIDES MATCHING LOANS TO BRING FIVE HUNDRED NEW RECYCLING CENTERS TO UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE. LET ME BE CLEAR FUNDING FOR THESE INCENTIVES COMES EXCLUSIVELY FROM EXISTING BEVERAGE INDUSTRY PAYMENTS AND REDEEM FUNDS. WE CAN MODERNIZE THIS IMPORTANT RECYCLING PROGRAM QUICKLY AND SUSTAINABLY WITHOUT ANY GENERAL FUND OR RATEPAYER DOLLARS. THIS MEASURE IS SUPPORTED. BY A REMARKABLE COALITION OF RECYCLERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND EVEN SOME IN THE BEVERAGE SECTOR. I THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANKS FOR THE MISTER FRAZIER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING FORWARD ON THIS. REALLY TRAUMATIC EVENT WITH RECYCLING WHEN THE WORLD MARKET CRASHED- WHEN CHOI CHINA ACTUALLY WOULDN'T RECEIVE ANY MORE OF. THE GOODS THAT WE SENT. NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M HOPING FOR OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION IS THAT WE WORK TOWARDS CREATING AN ECONOMY IN OUR OWN STATE OF RECYCLING INSTEAD OF SENDING ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS OVERSEAS. AND INCENTIVIZING THESE THESE ECONOMIES. WE USE A CLEANER TECHNOLOGY TO. ADVANCE THIS PROCESS IN OUR OWN STATE. REDUCING GHGS ARE ON SHIPPING AND TRANSPORTATION AND ALL THAT AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CREATE REAL TIME JOBS ARE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA I APPLAUD THIS I HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IN CALIFORNIA SO WE DO OUR OWN RECYCLING HERE. I ASKED FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU MISS FRAZIER. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. ON THE ADMISSIBILITY MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH THANK YOU AMEN TO ALL OF THAT. AND WITH THAT CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE.

CAL GRANT SAYS TO. CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM SUPPORTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS SEEKING POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND A BETTER LIFE EVERY YEAR. NEVER THE LESS THIS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED SIX DECADES AGO AND NO LONGER MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE STATE'S STRUGGLING COLLEGE STUDENTS. NEARLY EVERY YEAR OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT DO NOT RECEIVE THE AWARD. FOR THESE STUDENTS THE LACK OF CAL GRANT SUPPORT CAN BE THE DECIDING FACTOR BETWEEN ATTENDING AND TAKING ON DEBT. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX WILL DO THE FOLLOWING DAY. CONSOLIDATES THE THREE CAL GRANTS IN TWO. I KNEW CAL GRANT TWO AND A CAL GRANT FOR PROGRAM THE CAL GRANT TO WILL GUARANTEE AN AXIS AWARD FOR ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WELL CAL GRANT FOR WILL MAINTAIN A TUITION FEE AWARD TO STUDENTS ATTENDING AN ELIGIBLE FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION.

THANK YOU MR MEDINA MR MCCARTY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS IS A- HUGE BILL FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR OUR STUDENTS ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS. WE KNOW TWO THINGS THAT COLLEGE IS REALLY EXPENSIVE. FIVE TIMES BECAUSE OF NON TUITION COSTS WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE THIS AMAZING CAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT'S AN ENTITLEMENT IF YOU APPLY WHEN YOU'RE A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT IF YOU APPLY WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY YEARS OLD. TWENTY FIVE TRYING TO GET YOUR LIFE BACK ON TRACK AND GOING TO COLLEGE AND APPLY FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. YOUR ODDS OF GETTING A CAL GRANT ARE ONE AND TWELVE. SO WE HAVE. A PROGRAM THAT RASKIN'S ACCESS BERG CAL GRANT. SO THIS BILL COUPLED WITH OUR BUDGET ACTION WILL MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACTUALLY MAKE COLLEGE. DEBT FREE IN CALIFORNIA NOT FREE COLLEGE BUT DEBT FREE COUPLED WITH OUR EXISTING CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WITH EXISTING RESOURCES STUDENTS CAN COULD BE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE. GET A DEGREE ALONG WITH USING THEIR- FAMILY INCOME WHEN THEY FIRST APPLY WORKING FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK AND NOT HAVE TO TAKE OUT SO MUCH DEBT AND GRADUATE WITH TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT. THAT'S AN ISSUE IMPACTING SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

CLOSER ALL TIE THAT I SIXTY NINE KNOWS ONE. THE MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS IN FILE ORDER THIS IS FILE ITEM THIRTY THREE AB FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX BY MISTER MCCARTY CLERK WILL READ SOME PEOPLE FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND OTHERS NOT LIVING REAL PROPERTY MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS IS A BILL RELATED TO RACIAL HOUSING COVENANTS THAT STILL EXIST. AN IMPORTANT BUT OCT BUT ACTUALLY- DISAPPOINTING CHAPTER OF OUR UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA ALSO DISCUSSED YESTERDAY. THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY THE WORDS ON HOUSING DEEDS WHICH SAY ESSENTIALLY WHITES ONLY- WE GOT RID OF THOSE AND WATER FOUNTAINS DECADES AGO BUT THEY STILL EXIST WHEN PEOPLE GO AND BUY A HOME OR GO THROUGH THEIR DEEDS. OR THEIR- HOUSING COVENANTS THIS BILL WILL TAKE PRO ACTIVE STEPS TO REMOVE THESE RACIST COVENANTS WHICH ARE A PRIVATE AGREEMENTS BARRING NON WHITES FROM OCCUPYING OR OWNING HOMES. WELL THESE ARE PRIVATE. DEALS PRIVATE PRIVATE AGREEMENTS- THEY WERE AN IMPORTANT TOOL BY GOVERNMENT TO SEGREGATE NEIGHBORHOODS. OF COURSE TODAY THEY ARE UNENFORCEABLE ANY LEGAL BUT THE REMAIN HOUSING DOCUMENTS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. I KNOW WHEN I BOUGHT MY FIRST TIME IN TAL PARK TWENTY SO YEARS AGO OUR REALTOR SAID HEY YOU'RE GOING TO SIGN THIS BIG STACK OF PAPERS NOW FOR YOUR NEW HOME. I KNOW YOU'RE BIRACIAL I KNOW YOUR WIFE IS MEXICAN AMERICAN YOUR OF YOUR A DIVERSE FAMILY DON'T DON'T READ THOSE WORDS ON PAGE FIFTY SEVEN THAT SAY SENSUALLY WHITES ONLY SO WHAT WE DID WE WENT READ PAGE FIFTY SEVEN. AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE STILL IN THESE IN THESE DOCUMENTS THAT EXIST TODAY WILL THEY STILL ARE TODAY. SO IF ANYTHING WE LEARNED THAT LAST YEAR THE YEAR OF GEORGE FLOYD IS TAKING A LOOK AT THE RACIAL INJUSTICES THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY AND ONE THING THAT WE SHOULD DO IS REMOVE THESE WHITES ONLY SIGNS LIKE THEY'RE HAVING WATER FOUNTAINS THROUGHOUT OUR HOUSING. COVENANTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE I REALIZE THATWE HAVE PARTIES THAT ARE ARE ARE WORKING WITH THAT SOME ARE. PROPOSING A DIFFERENT PATH- THE UNLESS AMENDED AND WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR- LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION THE REALTORS TO MAKE SURE WE DO THIS RIGHT. BUT THE FACT REMAINS IS THAT. MOST FRANKLY EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA AT THE END OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES IN THIS ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET RID OF THESE. HARMFUL COVENANTS THEY'RE NOT AN FORCIBLE BUT THE PAINFUL MEMORIES. LINGER ON. MEMBERS THIS WEEK WE ALL GOT A BOOK FROM OUR LOCAL REALTORS IN OUR OFFICE THAT. THIS TITLE THE COLOR OF LAW. A FORGOTTEN HISTORY OF HOW OUR GOVERNMENT SEGREGATED AMERICA. PERMISSION TO READ MISTER SPEAKER. WITHOUT OBJECTION. JUSTICE ONE NOTE FROM THAT I THINK JUST TALKS ABOUT WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. WE AS A NATION HAVE AVOIDED CONTEMPLATING REMEDIES BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT ARE COMFORTABLE DELUSION THAT OUR SEGREGATION HAS NOT RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM. STATE ACTION AND SO WE CONCLUDE THERE IS NOT MUCH WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO ABOUT IT. BUT ONCE IN TRENCHES SEGREGATION IS DIFFICULT TO REVERSE AND THE EASIEST COURSE IS TO IGNORE IT. WHAT WILL THIS BILL WILL MAKE SURE WE DON'T IGNORE IT AND COME UP WITH REMEDY SO INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS CAN EASILY GO. TO OUR LOCAL COUNTY OFFICIALS REMOVED THE BERRIES IT CAN CHANGE THE CONFIDENCE ON THE ROUND AND ALSO WE CAN ADDRESS THE REST OF THE BOOK THE HOUSING CALIFORNIA HAS THESE CABINETS. MISTER SPEAKER ASK YOUR IDOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MCCARTY. SEEING NO MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THIS BILL. CARCLUB RURAL. ESERVER ALL MEMBERS OF DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS OF. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT. THE CLERK WILL CLOSE THE ROLE AND TALLY TE ICE FIFTY TWO NO ZERO. THAT MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO BE BACK IN THE FILE. TO FILE ITEM SEVENTEEN THIS IS MISS GONZALEZ IS AB. TWO FIFTY SEVEN. FILE ITEM SEVENTEEN AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN Y MISS GONZALES. AND THE CLERK WILL READ ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIFTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LORENA GONZALEZ AND ACCOLADES OF THE FOOD FACILITIES AND EMPLOYMENT. THIS GONZALEZ YOU MAIL THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN BEGAN TO ADDRESS A LONG STANDING ISSUE IN THE FAST FOOD RESTAURANT INDUSTRY BOOK BY ALLOWING WORKERS A VOICE ON THE JOB THROUGH A STATE WIDE FAST FOOD SECTOR COUNCIL MADE UP OF EMPLOYERS WORKERS AND STATE AGENCIES. THERE NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND FAST FOOD WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA SEND FAST FOOD WORKERS EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE LOWEST WAGES IN THE STATE ALONG WITH WAGE THEFT HARASSMENT AND UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. AND DEMOCRATS ONLY FURTHER MAGNIFIED THE SYSTEMATIC PROBLEMS UCSF STUDY FOUND THAT FOOD WORKERS FOOD SERVICE WORKERS WERE SOME OF THE MOST AT RISK OF CONTRACTING DIE FROM POPE IN NINETEEN WITH LINE COOKS TAKING THE TOP SPOT. WORKERS HAVE FILED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS DOCUMENTING VIOLATIONS OF COVERT SAFETY MEASURES PUBLIC HEALTH LAWS AND LABOR LAWS THE VAST MAJORITY OF ESTABLISHMENTS 89% WERE NON COMPLIANT WITH AT LEAST FIVE OF SIXTEEN TO FIND ELEMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE FOR PREVENTING COVE IN NINETEEN. ONE NOTABLE EXAMPLE A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT LOS ANGELES ILLEGALLY FIRED FOUR EMPLOYEES WHO PROTESTED WORKPLACE CONDITIONS THAT WERE UNSAFE FOR MANAGING THE SPREAD CODED. HERE IN SACRAMENTO- OUTGROW RATHER WE HAD A MANAGER WHO ACTUALLY REQUESTED PP FOR THE WORKERS IN THE FACILITY BUT BECAUSE THE OWNER OF THE MCDONALD'S DIDN'T BELIEVE IN COALBED HE REFUSED THAT MANAGER ACTUALLY ENDED UP QUITTING UNFORTUNATELY THE WORKERS WHO WORK THERE COULD NOT HAVE A WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THE STANDARDS ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIFTY SEVEN EMPOWERS WORKERS A LARGE FAST FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS WITH THE ABILITY TO SHAPE THEIR OWN WORKPLACE STANDARDS THROUGH A STATEWIDE FAST FOOD SECTOR COUNCIL. THIS BILL HOLD CORPORATE FRANCHISORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ENSURING THE FRANCHISEES COMPLY WITH HEALTH SAFETY AND EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS WE EXPECT ALL EMPLOYERS TO ABIDE BY ADDITIONALLY AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN WOULD PROHIBIT RETALIATION AGAINST WORKERS WHO SIMPLY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE COMPLAINTS ABOUT UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. THE END OF THE DAY WE CALL THESE WORKERS ESSENTIAL WORKERS WOULD THEY ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO WORK AND FEED OUR FAMILIES WHILE WE STAYED HOME IN CLOSE QUARTERS WITH LOW PAY. AND OFTEN NO BENEFITS THESE ARE WORKERS THAT ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR STATE AND HAVE NEVER HAD A VOICE ON THE JOB. BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF MANAGEMENT THERE IS ALMOST NO WAY TO ACTUALLY ORGANIZE FAST FOOD WORKERS. IN THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN HAVE A VOICE ON THE JOB IS THROUGH THIS KIND OF SAID TWIRL COUNCIL. EIGHT A COUNCIL THAT WOULD GIVE THEM A VOICE ALONG WITH THE CORPORATIONS AND THE FRANCHISEES IN GOVERNMENT THE PEOPLE WERE MAKING THE RULES. ANYTHING THIS COUNCIL WOULD DECIDE COULD ALWAYS BE UNDONE BY THE LEGISLATURE IF IT WENT TOO FAR. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THEIR WORKPLACES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE THAT IS HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF FAST FOOD WORKERS BECAUSE THEY LEAD THE WAY BECAUSE WE GAVE THEM A VOICE IN THE MEDIA. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT IT'S TIME THEY HAVE A VOICE IN THE WORKPLACE AS WELL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS CONSEILS MISPRINT HARBATH. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I WASN'T TRYING TO SPUR US SPEAK OF THIS ITEM. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER WORKED IN A FRANCHISE. WHEN I WENT TO BERKELEY I DO NOT HAVE MONEY I WORK THREE JOBS. ONE OF THEM WAS AT A SANDWICH SHOP. AND IF YOU WANT TO TELL YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHICH ONE ON BANCROFT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I WAS SEXUALLY HARASSED THERE. AND I WAS WORKING FOR TWENTY FIVE WAS LIKE I CN WORKING FOR TWENTY FIVE MANY PLACES. I QUIT. AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT QUITE GUILTY. THAT I LET THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO PUT IT DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO JUST QUIT AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND- VIDEOTAPE A HUNDRED WORDS A MINUTE AND COULDN'T GET THE EIGHTY DOLLAR DOLLAR JOB ON CAMPUS- AND AT THE TIME IT REFLECTIVE. VERY OFTEN ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE. BUT IF THERE HAD BEEN A UNION THERE I WOULD HAVE GONE TO THAT UNION REP AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN PROTECTED. SO WE THERE IS AND THIS IS THE ROOM TOUCH CODE IT DOESN'T TOUCH THIS. THERE ARE SOME THINGS. I THINK WE NEED TO DO. FOR THESE VERY VULNERABLE WORKERS. THERE SOMETHING'S ABOUT THIS BILL I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. BUT WE KNOW WE HAVE A AUTHOR WHO WORKS HARD. AND I TRUST THAT WILL CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER. AS THIS GOES TO THE SENATE SHOULD LEAVE THE HOUSE TODAY. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO IT TO GIVE THE OFFER THE CHANCE TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT. BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE ME. NOT OF COLOR AND YOU CAN IMAGINE. THOSE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER WOMEN. AND MAYBE TRANSGENDER FOLKS IN LGBT FOLKS. WHO FEEL MORE VULNERABLE. AND GIVE US A CHANCE TO PROTECT THEM. THANK YOU. THERE IS BOERNER HORVATH. MR COOLEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I RISE ON THIS BILL AND I HAVE. CERTAINLY NOT LOOKING TO PICK A FIGHT WITH ANY PART OF OUR STATE'S WORKFORCE. BUT HONESTLY I LOOK AT THIS BILL AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING A BILL FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AND I JUST FIND IT SHOCKING. AND I SORT OF FEEL ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBERSHIP I HAVE TO SAY I FIND IT SHOCKING. THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A COUNCIL COMPRISED OF ELEVEN INDIVIDUALS. ANY SIX OF WHOM CAN PASS A POLICY. BY STATUTE. THIS THE POLICIES ADOPTED BY THE SIX PEOPLE. OVERRIDE AND ALL OF FIGHT ANY REGULATIONS IN THIS SPACE. THEY OVERRIDE STATUTES. SO WE ARE A SOCIETY COMMITTED TO THE RULE OF LAW. MEDIATED BY INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNANCE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND LEGISLATURE. TO EMPOWER SIX INDIVIDUALS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO FEDERAL. AND JUST OVER RULES THE STATUTE IS SHOCKING IT'S SORT OF TO GO BACK TO ENGLAND IT STARTS CHAMBER STUFF. DO YOU HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE MAKING RULINGS THAT ARE THEIR VIEW OF WHAT'S RIGHT AND OVERRIDES% EVERYTHING ELSE. IN THE FORTY YEARS OF READING BILLS. I HAVE NOT SEEN A PROVISION THIS SWEEPING. AND SOLE UNDERMINING OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT'S- I JUST FEEL IT IS A SO BAD FORMULA. AND IF THIS IDEA TAKES ROOT HERE EVERY SECTOR WILL LIKE THIS SORT OF THING. YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THERE SHALL BE NO LOCKS UP BY STATUTE THE STATUTE OF STEP BY BILL IT RUNS THROUGH THE TWO HOUSES IT'S SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR TO CONFER UPON ANY BODY THIS SORT OF VAST AUTHORITY AND IT'S- IT'S JUST. EXTERNALLY PROBLEMATIC- PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION. VERBATIM FROM THE BILL THE COUNCIL FOR PROVIDE DIRECTION TO AND COORDINATE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S SECOND BRANCH AGENCIES LOCAL IS REGARDING HEALTH SAFETY EMPLOYMENT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT WORKERS THE COUNCIL SHALL PROMULGATE MINIMUM FAST FOOD RESTAURANT EMPLOYER STANDARDS INCLUDING AS APPROPRIATE STANDARDS ON WAGES WORKING CONDITIONS AND TRAINING AS A REASON THAT'S VERY APPROPRIATE TO PROTECT THOSE FOR THE WELFARE PRESS FOR RESTAURANT WORKERS- TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN STANDARDS RULES REGULATIONS. ISSUED BY THE COUNCIL. AND THE RULES OR REGULATIONS ISSUED BY ANOTHER STATE AGENCY. THE STANDARD RULES OR REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE COUNCIL SELLER PRIVATE FAST FOOD RESTAURANT WORKERS. AND FRANCHISEES ARE FRENCH DOORS SOURCE AND THE CONFLICTING RULES OR REGULATION OF THIS DIVISION AGENCIES SHALL NOT HAVE FORCE OR- EFFECT. WITH RESPECT TO- RESTAURANT WORKER FRANCHISEE'S DECISIONS MADE BY THE COUNCIL REGARDING THE STANDARDS SHALL BE MADE BY AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF AT LEAST SIX. OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS IS ONLY ELEVEN. SO A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF ELEVEN. MAKE THESE RULES OVER ACT SO I JUST FEEL THIS IS SUCH A BAD. CONCEPTION FOR THE RULE OF LAW SO I'M SORT OF STAND WITH THE MAGNA CARTA AND AGAINST STAR CHAMBER IN ANY SETTING. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE IS NOT. LEGITIMACY ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. BUT I JUST FEEL I HAVE TO STAND UP AND OBJECT TO THIS BECAUSE THE WAY IT'S PUT TOGETHER. ORIGINAL. HAMISH COOLEY DR QUIRK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I'M I AM NOT YET DECIDED BUT I HAVE THE SAME CONCERN IS MR COOLEY. IF THE AUTHOR IS WILLING TO SAY IN HER CLOTHES THAT YOU'LL TAKE THAT PART OUT THEN I CAN GO UP. OTHERWISE I CAN'T. THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH ENFORCEMENT EVEN FOR CURRENT LAW. EVEN FOR CURRENT LAWS. AND I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR THAT YOU WORK TO GET. BETTER ENFORCEMENT TO GET MORE INSPECTORS OUT THERE TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO ENFORCE THE LAWS WE HAVE ALREADY. IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE TWO IN YOUR CLOTHES I MAY BE ABLE TO GO UP THANK YOU. I THANK THE COURT MISS CARILLO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKERS AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO FIVE SEVEN THE FAST RECOVERY ACT IN BEHALF OF WORKERS IN THE FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN AND A UNION IN FACT WHEN I WAS WITH THE C. I. U. A FEW YEARS AGO THIS IS WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF SEIU UNITED LONG TERM CARE WORKERS NOW PART OF THIS YEAR YOU TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND IN FACT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT WE CAN DISCUSS AROUND THAT BUT THAT'S CALIFORNIA LOOKS TO RECOVER FROM THE PAD PANDEMIC THE STATE FACES A VERY REAL CROSSROADS RETURNED TO THE SCHOOL THE STATUS QUO OR REVITALIZED CALIFORNIA BY EMPOWERING AND PROTECTING THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO CARRIED US THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC DURING THE DEPTHS OF KOVAN NINETEEN WHEN RESTAURANTS WERE FORCED TO SHUT DURING GROCERY SHELVES WERE EMPTY HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIA FAST FOOD WORKERS TO PUT ON THEIR UNIFORMS TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES FROM BEHIND THEIR COUNTERS GRILLS. AND DRIVE THROUGH WINDOWS THEY DID SO IN THE FACE OF HARROWING CONDITIONS LIKE BEING GIVEN DOGGIE DIAPERS AS MASS BEING DENIED PAID SICK LEAVE OR QUARANTINE PAY AND EVEN RETALIATION WHEN THEY SPOKE UP AGAINST THESE ISSUES LARGE FAST FOOD COMPANIES LIKE MCDONALD'S ARE NOT POSITION TO RETURN TO PRE PANDEMIC PROFIT LEVELS WITH GROWTH EXPECTING. MOVING FORWARD. I PERHAPS MANY OF YOU KNOW BUT I ACTUALLY WORKED FOR MCDONALD'S WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER. AND I STILL HAVE MY- MY- NAME BADGE- THERE IS A VERY REAL STEREO TYPE WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORKERS AT FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS. THAT THEY ARE TEENAGERS PART TIME FAST FOOD WORKERS. BUT HERE IS THE REAL PICTURE AND MANY OF THOSE I WAS SEVENTEEN AT THE TIME MANY OF THOSE WERE MY COLLEAGUES. WOMEN MAKE UP TWO THIRDS OF THE FAST FOOD WORKERS NATIONWIDE. ONLY A QUARTER OF FAST FOOD WORKERS ARE TEENAGERS WHICH IS ABOUT MADE OF LATINO BLACK API AND IMMIGRANT WORKERS. THESE NUMBERS ARE. THE MAY INCOME EARNERS OF. STE AND- IN REFLECT. THE COMMUNITY HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING MY OWN. IN STEERING CALIFORNIA TOWARD AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY WE CANNOT LEAVE BEHIND ESSENTIAL WORKERS LIKE THE MEN AND WOMEN. WHO MAKE UP THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY AND THAT IN OUR STATE THEY HAVE SERVED US. AND NOW WE MUST RETURN. THAT FAVOR BY HELPING THEM GAIN A STRONG VOICE AND- A WAY TO HOLD. THEIR BOSSES ACCOUNTABLE. MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN LEFT BURNT VULNERABLE THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT ALONE. THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT RESOURCES MANY OF THEM DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE COVERT NINETEEN. TESTING MUCH MORE SO THE COVERT NINETEEN VACCINE WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON EQUITY EFFORTS WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE EFFORTS. THIS IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY OUR WORK IS TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE LOBBYIST. THAT DON'T HAVE POWER IN THIS BUILDING THAT'S HOW WE MAKE THIS HOUSE THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE BY PROTECTING AND ENSURING THAT ESSENTIAL WORKERS. THAT WORKED AND SUFFERED THE MOST THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE COME CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES TO EQUITY. AND PROTECTION THIS IS WHY I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL THIS IS WHY I URGE ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL LET'S NOT JUST TALK ABOUT ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND PROTECTING THEM. BUT LET'S ACTUALLY DO IT AND LET'S DO IT BY VOTING I AM AB TWO FIVE SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CHRISTMAS KALRA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. IN A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO I WAS AT A MCDONALD'S AT FIVE AM AS A NUMBER OF WORKERS THAT ARE GOING ON STRIKE- FOR THE WEEK. WENT ON STRIKE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THIS IS AS COLD IT WAS REALLY HITTING US HARD AND THE PARTICULAR RESTAURANT DIDN'T HAVE ANY SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WEATHER SPORTS A GLASS OR PROPER SANITATION EQUIPMENT OR WHAT HAVE YOU. SO THE WORKERS COURAGEOUSLY WENT ON STRIKE. THEY RETURNED ON THAT FRIDAY AT FIVE AM. AND TO THEIR DELIGHT THE MANAGEMENT ACTUALLY DID PUT HIM MEASURES FOR THEIR SAFETY NOW THAT WAS A GOOD CASE SCENARIO GOOD OUTCOME THE MAD THE THAT RUSSIA COULD EASILY JUST INSPIRED THEM. ABOUT A BEEN THE END OF THE STORY. AND THE REALITY IS THAT FOR SO MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF OUR WORKERS THAT IS HOW THEY LIVE THEY LIVE AT THE WHIM. OF WHAT THEIR EMPLOYER CHOOSES TO DO OR NOT. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN HAVE THIS TALK ABOUT- FOR FORTY YEARS THIS OUT OF THE OTHER. BLESSED RECORD HOP WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS FOR WORKERS TO OUR FAST FOOD WORKERS TWELVE. WE'LL GO WAGE WORKERS OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS. THEY HAD BECOME LESS SOME POWER. THEY HAVE THEIR WAGES HAVE REMAINED STAGNANT EVEN WITH US INCREASING MINIMUM WAGES STILL HASN'T KEPT UP. WITH THE COST OF LIVING INCREASES. AND THIS PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY. A VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY FOR US TO CREATE INDUSTRY WIDE STANDARDS WHERE THEY DID WHERE IT DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW. AND SO IT'S NOT SOME FAR FETCHED IDEA OF QUITE THE OPPOSITE IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY. OF HELPING TO GUIDE OUR STATE HOPING TO GUIDE OSHA- BUT WHICH WE ALWAYS GOT I JUST OF THE BILL LAST YEAR THAT WAS SIGNED THAT DIRECTED ACTIONS THAT OSHA NEEDS TO TAKE IN TERMS OF PROTECTING WORKERS. SO THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON AND I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN US HAVING TO COME BACK EVERY YEAR AND DO ONE OFF BILLS HERE ONE OF BILLS THERE INSTEAD WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE. A COUNCIL. THAT WE HAVE. THROUGH OUR SPEAKER. THE ABILITY TO APPOINT. FOLKS WITH EXPERTISE IN THESE AREAS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO ADVISE AS TO WHAT INDUSTRY WIDE STANDARDS MAKE THE MOST SENSE AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE I WOULD LIKE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AS WE NEED MORE MORE OSHA INSPECTORS ABSOLUTELY SIGN ME UP. WE NEED TO PUT MUCH MORE IN TWO INSPECTORS OSHA INSPECTORS WE NEED MULTI LINGUAL OSHA INSPECTORS FAR MORE THAN WE HAVE NOW SO I ABSOLUTELY WILL COSIGN THAT AND IF THIS BILL- IS SUCCESSFUL AND IS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR OUR NEXT STEP SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES WE GIVE TO OSHA AS WE SEE IN THIS PANDEMIC. IS THAT LACK OF ABILITY FOR OSHA TO DO INSPECTIONS THAT HAS LED. TO NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH SO MANY OF THE SAFETY STANDARDS FALLING BELOW BUT WE SHOULD ALL BE CONSUMED WILL BE SHUT OFF CONSIDERED THE STATUS QUO AND SO. THERE'S A REASON WHY THE NUMBER ONE PROFESSION THAT'S DIED DURING TWELVE IT OR COOKS THESE ARE COOKS A FANCY RESTAURANTS. YOU KNOW OF YOUR FOUR STAR RESTAURANTS. THE ARE CLOSE ABOUT WOULD REST THAT HAVE BEEN. THE NUMBER ONE PROFESSIONALS DIED FROM COLD. AND SO IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE HAVE WILL BE PUT IN PLACE. AND ACTUALLY ORGANIZED A MECHANISM TO PUT FORTH HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR THE FAST FOOD SECTOR. AND SO YOU KNOW. I GET I GET AGAIN LET'S NOT FALL INTO THIS. FEAR MONGERING TRAP THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS SOME. YOU KNOW VOTED GOVERNMENT OVER REACH IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE THIS IS A WAY FOR US. TO PROTECT THOSE. IN OUR PUBLIC THOSE THAT ARE WORKING EVERY SINGLE DAY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- THAT WE- CAN REMAIN SAFE SO WITH THAT I HEARD YOUR AYE ABOUT. THINGS KALRA MR SANTIAGO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. LOOK I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DEBATE FOR AGAINST IN THOSE WHO HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION YET. AND WHAT I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY IT IS WE SPENT A YEAR OR SO. TALKING ABOUT EQUITY. BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS EVERYTHING BUT EQUITY. LET'S TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAD TO GO TO WORKING KERN ZOOM COMFORTABLY FROM HOME. LET'S TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE FIRED THAT THEY NEED MASKS. LET'S TALK ABUT THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO STILL HAD TO SHOW UP TO WORK. AND BARELY MADE A MINIMUM WEIGHT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. FOLKS WHO IN MANY CASES WHO OWN HOMES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE CONTINUOUSLY CUT HOURS DURING THE WORST OF A PANDEMIC. AND WE ALL WANT TO SEE I GET IT WILL WANT TO SEE SMALL BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO THRIVE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THEN I WILL ADMIT THAT THEY ARE GOOD ACTORS OUT THERE NO WAS NEGATING THAT. BUT WHAT WE SAW ACOSTA CALVIN WHAT WE SAW IN OUR BACKYARDS WHAT I SAW IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. WHERE THE LARGE CHAIN FAST FOOD COMPANIES WHO MADE HISTORIC PROFITS BECAUSE WHEN WE ALL DROVE AROUND OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WE SAW. THAT DOES IN SOME CASES A SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED. THE ONES WHO MADE ON PRESIDENT OF PROFITS WERE THE ONES WHO ALSO TREATED IN MANY CASES THE WORKERS THE WORST AND WE SAW THIS. WE SPENT OVER A YEAR TALKING ABOUT EQUITY. WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN THIS BILL IS BASIC RIGHTS. SO THAT WHEN SOMEBODY ASKS FOR MASKS OR SOMEBODY SAID THAT THEY MAY BE UNHEALTHY WORK STANDARDS BUT THEY'RE NOT FIRED BUT THEY'RE NOT REDUCED HOURS. WHEN SOMEBODY ASKED FOR DIGNITY AT WORK. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T ZOOM. WHO BARELY MADE A MINIMUM WAGE WHO COULDN'T PAY THEIR BILLS. AND WE'RE ALL SET WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE NORMAL THIS PANDEMIC IS OVER. AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THOSE. JOBS. WHO WERE HIT THE HARDEST DURING A PANDEMIC. GIVE US THE ABILITY. GIVE US THE ABILITY. TO PROTECT LOW INCOME EARNERS. CALLING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR GIVE US THAT ABILITY BECAUSE THERE'S NONE OF THAT WAS NO PROTECTION DURING A PANDEMIC AND THERE ARE NO PROTECTIONS IN MANY CASES FOR MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY GO TO WORK. LOOK ALL SAY THAT'S BECAUSE MOST OF YOU GUYS KNOW MY HISTORY MY PARENTS CAME HERE THERE ARE UNDOCUMENTED. YEAH MY DAD MY DAD CLEAN TAPE. CLEAN TABLES AT A RESTAURANT AND- EVENTUALLY HE BECAME THE GUY WHO FLIPPED THE BURGERS AND I WAS A BIG DEAL FOR US AT HOME. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN THERE WAS FOOD LEFT OVER SOMEBODY TO WANT YOU TO GET HOME WE HAD. WE ARE NOT LOOK WE ARE LOOKING TO PROTECT. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK EXTREMELY HARD AND HAVE NO PROTECTIONS AND PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE DURING A PANDEMIC. GIVE US THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE A BID TO GIVE A VOICE TO THOSE. WHO JUST DON'T HAVE IT. FORTUNATELY MOST OF US HERE. WELL SINCE THE MOST OF US HERE HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO ZOOM IN MANY CASES FOR THE THINGS THAT WE DO. AND WE'VE BEEN BLESSED TO DO THAT. BUT WHEN YOU'RE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER. AND YOUR KIDS ARE DEPENDING ON YOU TO PAY FOR RENT AND FOOD AND MANY OF THE KIDS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ONCE I WENT HUNGRY EVERY NIGHT. THEY DON'T OFTEN HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO OR THAT VOICE. AND THIS BILL WILL GIVE THEM THAT VOICE. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. WHEN THEY GO TO WORK. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR SANTIAGO MR KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THINK THAT THE ISSUES RAISED BY THIS BILL AND WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR SECTOR ARE NOT WITHOUT MERIT AND THAT'S NOT EVEN TO MENTION ALL THE STUFF THAT'S BEING PUT. IN OUR FOOD- BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A BAIL WHERE ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR ARE ACTUALLY ARGUMENTS AGAINST FOR THE REASON CITED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM RANCHO CORDOVA THAT IF THESE PROBLEMS REALLY ARE SO SEVERE THAN THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH THE DIGNITY. OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH CAN PRODUCE CHANGE IT IS NOT JUST LEGAL AND JURIDICAL BUT CULTURAL IS MORE DURABLE MORE MEANINGFUL. WHEREAS WE ABDICATE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SOME UNELECTED BOARD THAT ACTUALLY MINIMIZES THE ISSUES THAT ARE AT STAKE I SUGGESTED OF A- I THINK AVERAGE KELLY MISTER SMITH. YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN. THIS BODY IS KILLED MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THE STATE. AIRLINE JOBS IN THIS STATE. CONSTRUCTION JOBS IN THIS STATE AND NOW WE'RE GOING AFTER MINIMUM WAGE JOBS THE FRANCHISEES IN EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICTS IS OWNED BY A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. IT'S NOT THE BIG GOLDEN ARCHES OR THE BURGER KING OR WHATEVER BIG FRANCHISE THEY ARE OWNED BY INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES IN OUR DISTRICT. I'VE SAT HERE AND I'VE LISTENED AND I'VE LISTENED AND WE KEEP KILLING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. THE MINIMUM WAGE JOB IS NOT A CAREER. TO PAY FOR YOU TO GO TO SCHOOL IT'S PAY FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. TRANSITIONING INTO COLLEGE. IT'S NOT A CAREER BUT WE P. PUT REGULATIONS ON THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS SO WHEN THEY CLOSE THE NEXT FRANCHISE IN YOUR DISTRICT. YOUR GOAL WHAT HAPPENED WE KEEP COULDN'T SO MANY REGULATIONS ON THESE BUSINESS OWNERS THEY CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE. I VERGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE ALL RIGHT I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR I WISH THAT SOME FOLKS WHO SPOKE ON THE FLOOR WOULD COME ASK ME BEFOREHAND BUT I I'LL BE VERY CLEAR NUMBER ONE THE APPOINTMENT TO THIS BOARD IF YOU WILL PROVIDE SIX LEGISLATIVE APPOINTEES OF THE ELEVEN THE OTHER FIVE COME FROM THE GOVERNOR THIS IS NOT JUST SOME RANDOM BOARD THAT THAT WILL MAKE DECISIONS. AND IT'LL INCLUDE CORPORATE FRANCHISE OR FRANCHISEES AND WORKERS ALSO INCLUDES OSHA AND LABOR COMMISSIONER BECAUSE IT'S TRUE WE DO NEED BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS WE DO NEED BETTER LAWS QUITE FRANKLY AND ALL OF THESE ARE PROBLEMS. IN THE PAST WHEN THE REASONS IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE WORKER TO HAVE EIGHT A SECTORIAL COUNCIL IS WE'VE NEVER PROVIDED WORKERS WITH THE VOICE YES WE CAN PASS THINGS HERE. AND I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE WORKERS THINK ARE ONCE BUT UNTIL THE WORKERS THEMSELVES HAVE A VOICE IT'S POINTLESS. THEY'RE NOT EMPOWERED TO SUGGEST IT LIKE WE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO WORKED. IN FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE FACING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT THEY NEED AND WHAT TYPES OF SUPPORT THEY NEED. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IN THIS BILL. I AM MORE THAN HAPPY I DON'T KNOW OUR DOCTOR COURT- MY COLLEAGUE- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SINCE I'M SO GOOD WHICH WELL I THINK. AND I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO WORKING ON A PIECE OF LEGISLATIVE RUBIO AND I UNDERSTAND WHY THAT MAKES PEOPLE NERVOUS RIGHT WE'RE NOT USED TO SAYING. ARE WE DON'T THINK WE'RE USED TO SAYING A COUNCIL COULD MAKE THESE DECISIONS BUT I DO WANT TO REMIND THIS THIS FLOOR. THAT FOR NINETY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD A WAGE BOARD FOR NINETY YEARS AND APPOINTED WAGE BOARD THAT MADE ALL THE DECISIONS. ON ON WAGE ORDERS. THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE TOOK IN FACT FROM THOSE WAGE. ORDER THE WHAT THE WAGE BOARD. THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS NEVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS WE'VE NEVER REALLY EMPOWERED WORKERS TO HAVE A VOICE THROUGH. A SECTORIAL COUNCIL. WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO. AND QUITE FRANKLY IT WORKS QUITE WELL THE FACT IS REMOTE REMIND BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA. SAID IN OTHER COUNTRIES AT THE SAME RESTAURANTS. THEY THEY ARE EITHER WORKERS PROBABLY NOT TWICE AS MUCH AS THEY DO HERE BECAUSE THEY NOT ONLY GET WAGE INCREASES BUT THEY ALSO HAVE PAID SICK DAYS AND HOLIDAYS IN HEALTH CARE. IN A BIG MAC COSTS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN CENTS MORE. ALL RIGHT SO THERE ARE THIS SEEMS TO WORK IN OTHER PLACES. TAILORING IT TO FIT WHAT WE'RE USED TO AND WHETHER IT'S A BARGAIN CONTRACT IF YOU WELL OUR OUR OUR- GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE SET IT EIGHT EIGHT AVERAGE NEW REGULATIONS OR WAGES. WE HAVE IN THE PAST ALLOW PEOPLE TO GO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AN COME BACK AND GET IT RATIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO AND WE CAN LEAD THE NATION BECAUSE GUESS WHAT EVERYTHING EVERYBODY SAID WAS TRUE YOU KNOW WHO DIED DURING THE PANDEMIC. COOKS DIET COKES THAT MCDONALD'S AND BURGER KING. PEOPLE WHO MADE IT YOUR FOOD IN ALLOWED YOU TO PICK IT UP THROUGH A WINDOW AND GO HOME AND BE SAFE WITH YOUR FAMILY THAT'S WHO DIED. IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE DURING THE TWO WHO CAME TO US AND SAID HEY WE HAVE PROBLEMS WE HAVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROBLEMS AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE COULDN'T GET A BILL OFFICE FLOOR. TO PROTECT THOSE WORKERS WE PROTECTED OURSELVES. WE PROTECTED THIS INSTITUTION BUT WE NEVER SEEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE WILL TO PROTECT THOSE WORKERS. SO IT'S TIME AND- WE LOOK OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR. AND SAY DO WE ACTUALLY THINK THESE HUMAN BEINGS. THESE MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND KIDS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS DESERVE THE RESPECT TO HAVE A VOICE ON THE JOB DESERVE THE RIGHT TO TELL THEIR STORIES ABOUT BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED AT WORK ABOUT NOT HAVING PP ABOUT BEING AN UNSAFE WORKING CONDITION ABOUT BEING RETALIATED WORK ABOUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE- RENT. MAYBE WE COULD QUIT PAYING PEOPLES RENT IT JUST ENSURE THAT THEY MAKE ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN PAY THEIR OWN DE AMOR AT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IT'S TIME WE GIVE WORKERS A VOICE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT BUT. THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL. RESEARCH PRESIDING VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF.

THREE OF US YEAR ALBUM I THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN A LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY AND A BILL THAT IS SPONSORED BY OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION. AB TWENTY SEVEN IS THE REINTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR AND CONTINUES TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY APPROACH TO ASSIST LOCAL COMMUNITIES TACKLING THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. THE BILL ESTABLISHES A STANDARDIZED PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING HOMELESS STUDENTS THIS MEASURE ALSO CREATES THREE GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP. LOCAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES USED IN IDENTIFYING AND CONNECTING HOMELESS STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO SERVICES. OUR CURRENT PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING HOMELESS CHILDREN FAILS TO GIVE THEM A FIGHTING CHANCE TO SUCCEED. A RECENT UCLA STUDY FOUND THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM IN OUR STATE ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THIS IS ENOUGH TO FILL DODGER STADIUM ALMOST FIVE TIMES OVER. IDENTIFYING CHILDREN WHO MIGHT BE HOMELESS IS THE FIRST STEP TO ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL AND IN LIFE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

WHICH HELPS INSURERS THE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS CAN WEAR TRIBAL REGALIA AT COMMENCEMENT CEREMONIES STUDENTS ALREADY HAVETHAT RIGHT UNDER THE U. S. AND CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS BUT SOME LOCAL EDUCATION OFFICIALS STILL OBJECT AND BANNED OBJECTS OF CULTURAL OR RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE AT THE CEREMONIES. THIRTY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CONTINUED TO RECEIVE COMPLAINTS FROM NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ABOUT SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WHO REFUSED TO LET STUDENTS WERE TRIBAL REGALIA. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN MY GOOD FRIEND OF ALASKA NATIVE- TODD GLORIA WHO NOW IS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO MOVE FORWARD A PIECE OF LEGISLATION A. B. TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. HOWEVER THE PROBLEM PERSISTS IN SPRING TWENTY TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE THE ACLU RECEIVED A COMPLAINT FROM A MEMBER OF THE ARMENIAN ROOTS AND TRIBE- WAS TOLD BY SAMBAR DINO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO WEAR AN EAGLE FEATHER AT HIS GRADUATION CAP. EAGLE FEATHERS ARE PRESENT FROM FAMILIES MOVING FORWARD WHERE THEY'RE EATING IN OUR CASE EATING A MEAL AND PRESENTING THAT THAT FEATHER TO THEM SO THAT BRINGS THE WHOLE SPIRIT OF THE FAMILY FORWARD IN A MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR EDUCATION IN THE YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE. WE SHOULD NOT HINDER THAT AS A STATE WE SHOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD CARRYING THEIR CULTURE FORWARD ESPECIALLY GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN EDUCATION. AB NINE FORTY FIVE WOULD CREATE A TEN MEMBER TASK FORCE WITH NINE MEMBERS THE TASK FORCE WILL BE CHARGED WITH IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS TO THIS ONGOING PROBLEM AND BE NAMED THE TASK FORCE TO STUDY DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES TO PROTECT PEOPLE RIGHTS PEOPLE'S RIGHTS.

SOME PEOPLE TEN SIXTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AND OTHERS AND I REALLY IN THE WATER QUALITY. MISTER BELOW. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE BEACH REPORT CARD WHERE ONE CAN LEARN WHETHER I'M THERE ARE HARMFUL SUBSTANCES IN THE WATER AT THE IN THE OCEAN WATER THAT WE SWIM IN ITS UBIQUITOUS AROUND THE STATE NOW WE'RE ALL GRATEFUL FOR THAT INFORMATION. WELL AB TWO TEN SIXTY SIX PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH BY CREATING A UNIFORM SET UP STATEWIDE MONITORING STANDARDS AND PROTOCOLS FOR TESTING BACTERIA IN HIGH USE FRESH WATER BODIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. VERY SIMILAR TO THE BEACH REPORT CARD WOULD BE APPLIED TO HI USE FRESH WATER BODIES ARE WOOD- BECOME COMMON- A MONTH FRESH FRESH WATER BODIES. THE FINDINGS WOULD THEN BE POSTED IN A SINGLE PLACE FOR WATER QUALITY DATA TO BE PUBLICLY SHARED. AB TEN SIXTY SIX REQUIRES THAT THE CALIFORNIA WATER QUALITY MONITORING COUNCIL IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC TO PROPOSE TO THE STATE WATER BOARD A DEFINITION. OF A MONITORED FRESH WATER RECREATION SITE ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS A KEY PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE AN OUTDOOR RECREATION AND THAT IS ENSURING THAT THERE ARE SCIENCE AND HEALTH BASED BACTERIAL STANDARDS. ONGOING WATER QUALITY MONITORING AND PUBLIC MOST IMPORTANTLY PUBLIC NOTIFICATION FOR FRESH WATER RECREATION WHERE NEEDED BECAUSE THE WATER ISN'T ALWAYS AS CLEAN AS WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. AND YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO SWIM OR IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE SWIMMING IN THAT WATER. WHAT'S GOING ON. THE BILL WAS AMENDED SIGNIFICANTLY IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND I BELIEVE THAT THE CHANGES MADE THE- TO THE BILL. WILL ALLEVIATE ANY CONCERNS HOWEVER I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK WHICH ONE. THE SEEING NO MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. CLICK LIBERAL. WE DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS HER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MY RESEARCH SERVER. WELL. CLOSE ROLL TIDE EYES FIFTY KNOWS EIGHT THAT MEASURE PASSES. IN FILER THIS IS FILE ITEM FORTY TWO AB ELEVEN THIRTY BY DOCTOR WOULD. AND THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN THIRTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND OTHERS IMMACULATE IN THE HEALTHCARE COSTS DR WOULD YOU MAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB ELEVEN THIRTY WHICH WILL CREATE THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WITHIN THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DVELOPMENT. ACCORDING TO RECENT POLLS HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IT ONLY CONTINUE TO GROW EIGHT OUT OF TEN CALIFORNIA SAY THAT MAKING HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OR VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. THE CONCEPT OF A COMMISSIONER OFFICE CHARGED WITH COST CONTAINMENT IS NOT A NEW ONE THERE ARE ALREADY SIX STATES THAT HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN PLACE AND THEY'RE SHOWING RESULTS SADLY CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONE OF THOSE STATES. THERE ARE HUGE DIFFERENCES IN THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY IN PARTS F SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COSTS ARE OUTCOMES ARE BETTER. IN HIGHER COST NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE PAY MORE AND GET LESS LESS FAVORABLE OUTCOMES WE NEED TO USE THIS INFORMATION TO ENCOURAGE SYSTEM WIDE IMPROVEMENTS. I KNOW THIS CONCEPT MAKES PEOPLE ON ON COMFORTABLE PARTICULARLY STAKEHOLDERS. BUT THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IS MAKING YOUR CONSTITUENTS MORE THAN UNCOMFORTABLE. THEY'RE WORRIED. THEY'RE FRUSTRATED THEY'RE ANGRY AND THEY'RE REACHING A BREAKING POINT. OUR QUEST TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE TO EVERYONE WILL NEVER BE SUSTAINABLE UNTIL WE CONTROL THE GROWTH THE COST THE COST OF GROWTH IN IN PROVIDING CARE. HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE AFFECTING EVERYTHING WAGES THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FAMILIES DECISION AS TO WHETHER STE TO SEEK CARE OR CONTINUED KERR. PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER IN STEYNING JOB THEY MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF HEALTH BENEFITS WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THESE THINGS. MOST OF YOU RECALL THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HAVE REGULATED RATES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM LET ME BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT. AB ELEVEN THIRTIES APPROACH IS BASED ON DATA AND TRANSPARENCY BY CREATING OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING AND ANALYZING MARKET INFORMATION AND ESTABLISHING COST SECTOR A SECTOR COST TARGETS. WE HAVE ACCEPTED A MENACE FROM EVERY STAKEHOLDER GROUP IS OFFERED THEM PRO AND CON AND WE ACCEPTED EVERY MINUTE NO BUT OUR PROCESS HAS BEEN OPEN COLLABORATIVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE THAT WAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THE COST OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING HAS BEEN RISING BY TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION SINCE MY FIRST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE NEED TO WORK TO CORRECT HIS ALARMING TREND WHILE WORKING TO INCREASE QUALITY AND ACCESS TO CARE. ACCORDING TO AN OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN ARTICLE IN THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON HEALTHCARE IS WASTED. THINK ABOUT THAT IF YOU TRANSLATE THAT TO CALIFORNIA THAT'S BETWEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND SEVENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S WASTED MARGINAL DISK DECREASES IN WAIST ALONE WOULD LIKELY BRING SPENDING CLOSER TO OR LOWER THAN THE RATE OF INFLATION WE NEED THE SYSTEM TO BE BEGIN TO THINK AND ACT DIFFERENTLY THAT'S THE GOAL HERE. DATE AND TRANSPARENCY THE KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING IMPROVING OUR SYSTEM WE CAN'T FIX WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ISSUE AS I DO WITH EVERYONE OF MY BILLS. MEMBERS I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THE EIGHT INTENT OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO BELIEVE THAT TACKLING GROWING COST OF HEALTH CARE IS AN EXTREMELY. OR VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD MR VOEPEL. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I SPENT THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE BUSINESS. DESIGNING HEALTH PLANS DOING ACTUARIAL STUDIES WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH MANY OF THE MAJOR INSURANCE COMPANIES. WHEN I FIRST WENT INTO THE BUSINESS THERE WAS OVER THIRTY FIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA DOING. HEALTH INSURANCE NOW THERE'S LESS THAN ELEVEN OR TWELVE DEPENDING UPON THE AREA SOME AREAS ONLY HAVE ONE. PROVIDER SOME HAVE TWO OR THREE SO THE MORE YOU TRY TO CONTROL HEALTH COSTS. THE MORE YOU WILL BE. ACTUALLY MAKING THE PROBLEM WORSE HERE'S WHY THERE IS DISPARITY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UCLA MEDICAL CENTER AND ANOTHER SMALLER MEDICAL CENTER SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU HAVE CYCLES IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS THERE ARE CYCLES WHERE RATES ARE SOMEWHAT STEADY OTHER TIMES REACTING TO MARKET FORCES THE RATES GO UP. MANY TIMES CORPORATIONS WILL SELF INSURE. IF THEY SELF INSURE IT DEPENDS UPON THEIR ACTUARIAL EXPERIENCE AS FAR AS THEIR CLAIMS GO IF CLAIMS ARE HIGH YOU HAVE TO RAISE YOUR PREMIUMS NOW THAT BRINGS ME ALSO TO A POINT. OUR. POPULATION IS AGING. AND BETWEEN AGE FIFTY FIVE IN EIGHT SIXTY TWO BEFORE SOMEBODY OR SIXTY FIVE BEFORE SOMEBODY CAN GO ON MEDICARE THAT IS THE HIGHEST MOST EXPENSIVE BRACKET. THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS TO APPROVE. ANY RATE INCREASES AND THAT IS A ELABORATE DANCE THAT'S DONE BETWEEN COMPANIES PROVIDERS EVERYBODY. SO WE ALREADY HAVE REGULATORY RULES GREATLY ENFORCE THIS PARTICULAR BILL. REALLY WILL. BRING A HEAVY HAMMER OUTSIDE THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT OUTSIDE INSURANCE MARKET PLACE THAT WE REALLY DON'T NEED RATES ARE GONNA GO UP NO MATTER WHAT. BECAUSE THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE BEAST IT WILL BE TWO TO THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN CPI THAT IS SIMPLY IT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE SPENDING ALMOST 18% OF OUR GDP ON HEALTHCARE. IT WILL GO 220% THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY MISS VOEPEL MISTER FLORA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND THEN MISTER CHAIR ITS PROS A START ON HEALTH WITH YOU IN IN HEALTH TO YOU EXPRESSED THAT IT WAS NOT YOUR INTENT TO CAPTURE SMALL. YOUR PHYSICIAN PRACTICES. I'M IN ONE OF THOSE EGGS- THE MEMBERS THAT YOU TOOK. IT EXEMPTED. THE INDEPENDENT- INDEPENDENT PHYSICIAN PRACTICES BUT THERE IS NO DEFINITION TO THAT. SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS IF YOU CAN HELP US TO FIND OUT AND IF YOU'RE WILLING TO COMMUTE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT PARTICULAR TO DEFINE THAT DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS APPRECIATE YOU CAN. DO IT IN A CLOSE. THANK THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO CHECK I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER IT NOW- OUR INTENTION IS TO EXEMPT THE SMALL- INDEPENDENT PRACTICES. THOSE SMALL PROVIDER PRESS GROUPS THAT ARE NOT FEELING WITH LARGER GROUPS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CAPTURE INDIVIDUAL DOCTORS. IN SMALL TOWNS THAT'S NOT THE IDEA WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE CHI COST DRIVERS. THE OUT LIARS THAT ARE THAT ARE- COMMANDING- THE MARKET AND DRIVING PRICES HIGHER SO WE ARE WE WERE WORKING TO CLARIFY THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDER WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. THANK AFTERWARD. THAT THEY CAN MISS FLORA. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS. SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM. DR WOULD YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU AND- RESPONDING TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN DIEGO AREA THIS BILL ISN'T JUST ABOUT INSURANCE THIS IS BILL IS ABOUT- HOSPITALS PROVIDERS DRUG COMPANIES AND INSURANCE IT'S ABOUT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM THE CONSOLIDATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PRECISELY THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE THAT'S LEADING TO HIGHER COSTS. AND SO THAT THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE LOOKING AT IN THIS ISSUE WE HAVE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS ENTIRE THING AND- I HOPE THAT YOU'LL JOIN WITH ME AND SUPPORT THE EIGHT IN TEN CALIFORNIANS WHO THINK THIS IS A PRETTY SERIOUS PROBLEM RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

ON MONDAY. ADRIN BLAZE. ALEX OF FRIDGE JOSE HERNANDEZ THIRD LARS KEPLER LANE PAUL DO LOOK. MEDIA TIMOTHY MICHAEL ROMEO MICHAEL JOSEPH. REMAKING AND TOUCHET SAYING. I IMPLORE YOU TO HONOR THEIR MEMORY BY SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISLI. MS WICKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE IS IT AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND I THINK MANY OF YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND WAS- FIVE DAYS ON THE JOB WORKING FOR GABBY GIFFORDS WHEN SHE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD. AND SOME OF HER STAFF WERE KILLED. MANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WERE KILLED. AND THAT SET HIS LIFE ON A DIFFERENT TRAJECTORY OF COURSE BUT CERTAINLY HERS TOO. AND THE COURAGE AND THE CONVICTION THAT SHE HAS EVERY SINGLE DAY TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT ON THIS ISSUE IS ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING AND AMAZING. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF COURAGE I'M ASKING FROM YOU OFF TODAY. TO HAVE COURAGE I KNOW THAT THIS IS A TAX. AND FOR SOME OF YOU THEY DON'T HAVE DISTRICTS LIKE MINE TAXES ARE HARD VOTES RIGHT AND I GET THAT. THIS IS A VERY SPECIFIC KIND OF TAX THOUGH. AND THE MONEY THAT IT GOES TO IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT PROGRAMS LIKE CALVET END GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE DATA THAT SAYS THAT THERE'S BEEN. ACADEMIC RESEARCH ON THIS. THAT SAYS THAT PROGRAMS LIKE HELD UP WHICH INVEST IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DO DIRECT VIOLENCE INTERRUPTION WORK IN THESE COMMUNITIES. LIKE USED TO LIVE FOR MY DISTRICT. THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS SHOT THEY HAVE WORKERS TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL THAT WORK WITH THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT COMMITTED TO NOT DO RETALIATORY SHOOTINGS. THAT REDUCES GUN VIOLENCE. WE HAVE TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS WE HAVE GOOD FUNDING THIS YEAR BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ON GOING FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS. WE HAVE GOOD LAWS IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY ON GUNS FOR THE MOST PART WERE BUT ONE OF THE MORE ADVANCED STATES RIGHT. BUT WHAT WE HAVE IS A FLOOD OF GUNS COMING IN FROM NEVADA. A FLOOD OF GUNS COMING IN FROM ARIZONA WE DON'T HAVE FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. SO THEN WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE HAVE GUN VIOLENCE WE HAVE TO INVEST IN THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY WORK. AND HERE'S THE TRUTH THAT NONE OF US LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE. IS THAT WHEN WE SEE THESE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THEIR HORRIFIC. WE GET A LOT OF MEDIA ATTENTION A LOT OF MEDIA ATTENTION FOR THOSE. BUT HERE'S THE ACTUAL REALITY. AND R. BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY. MANY THOSE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WE ARE LEAVING THESE COMMUNITIES BEHIND BY NOT INVESTING IN THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT IS ON ALL OF US RIGHT NOW TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN THESE PROGRAMS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY WORK. SO I UNDERSTAND IT'S A TOUGH VOTE FOR SOME FOLKS BUT I'M ASKING YOU TO HAVE COURAGE TO MAKE THAT VOTE. AND TO INVEST IN A RUN ABOUT COMMUNITIES THAT BEEN LEFT BEHIND FOR FAR TOO LONG. I WOULD HUMBLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE FIVE UNTIL TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU MISS WICKS MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I THANK GOD. A LOT OF US HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY. WHAT EMPATHY COMPASSION FOR THE VICTIMS IN THE FAMILIES RELATED TO GUN VIOLENCE. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT DOESN'T STOP. THOSE ROOT CAUSES THE THESE THINGS LIKE POVERTY. MENTAL HEALTH. THE THINGS THAT DRIVE PEOPLE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY USE A TOOL TO HARM OTHERS. THIS BILL DOESN'T STOP THAT. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE A TAX THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE UP THE COST. LET'S ALSO CONSIDER SOME FACTS OVER 60% OF GUN RELATED DEATHS OR SUICIDES. WHICH CUTS DEEP FOR ME PERSONALLY. BECAUSE I'VE LOST MORE FRIENDS TO SUICIDE THAT I HAVE FROM COMBAT. LET'S ALSO THINK OF ANOTHER FAT. THE PEOPLE WHO DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH GUNS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE KILLED OR INJURED. IN A CRIME. SO WITH THIS BILL ARE ARE YOU TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY. BY DRIVING UP THE COST OF AMMUNITION. BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POVERTY PEOPLE LETTER FOR AREAS OF OUR STATE LIKE MINE. WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS WHO WANT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND PROTECT THEM FOR FAMILY PROTECT. THEIR PROPERTY. ARE GOING TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO. IT YOU KNOW THE CURRENT JOKE OF TODAY IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE DATE OUT THERE'S TO GO SHOOT A NINE MILLIMETER AT A PIECE OF PLYWOOD. BECAUSE OF THE COST. THAT'S A FACT. SO WE JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE TAX A FORMULA. THEY JUST THROW ANOTHER TAX OUT THERE ANOTHER PROBLEM ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE A MASSIVE BUDGET SURPLUS. IS ANOTHER TAX TRULY WHAT Y'ALL WANT. I'M GONNA STAND WITH THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO ADDRESS POVERTY. TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH. THE STOP VIOLENCE AS A WHOLE. WHETHER IT'S WITH A GUN A KNIFE WHATEVER WE HAVE A VIOLENCE PROBLEM THAT'S A FACT. WHILE WE'RE AT IT LET'S CONSIDER SOME OF THE LOGIC THAT WE'VE HEARD. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO START TAXING THEM TO PAY FOR GUN VIOLENCE WHY ARE WE GONNA TAX SPOONS NEXT TO PAY FOR DIABETES. THINK ABOUT IT. MS CLARK SILVA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE. RECENTLY JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO ON THE FIFTY FIVE FREEWAY IN ORANGE COUNTY A SIX YEAR OLD BOY WAS SHOT AND KILLED DURING AN APPARENT ROAD RAGE. INCIDENT IN THE SECONDS OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION COMBINED WITH A GUN LED TO THE LOSS OF A LIFE FORTY SIX YEAR OLD BOY NAMED AIDEN. AIDEN'S LEOS WAS SEATED IN THE BOOSTER SEAT AND THE RIGHT REAR PASSENGER SIDE OF HIS MOTHER'S CAR WHEN HE WAS STRUCK BY GONE GUNFIRE OFF THE NORTHBOUND FIFTY FIVE FREEWAY. THE BULLET HAD ENTERED THE VEHICLE THROUGH THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRUNK GOING THROUGH AIDEN'S BACK. THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AS THEY WERE HEADED TO SCHOOL WHEN A CAR CUT THEM OFF AS THEY TRIED TO EXIT THE CAR POOL LANE. AIDEN'S MOTHER GESTURED TO THE TWO OCCUPANTS A MAN AND A WOMAN AND WAS EXITING THE LANE WHEN THE GUNFIRE ERUPTED. THOSE BRIEF MOMENTS LED TO A TRAGEDY THAT NO MOTHER SHOULD HAVE TO FACE. SHE WAS LEFT ON THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY HAVING TO HOLD EIGHT IN INNER ARMS HER DYING SON HELPLESS WHAT THE LAST WORDS THAT WERE SPOKEN BY. EIGHT IN BEING. MOMMY MOMMY MY TUMMY HURTS. THE GUNMEN WHO TOOK THE LIFE FOR HER INNOCENT YOUNG BOY REMAINS AT LARGE. AS MANY CONTINUE TO FIND THIS INDIVIDUAL. THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK US. ALL OF US AND WHEN DO WE SAY THE CONDOLENCES ARE NOT ENOUGH. WHEN DO WE SAY THE TRAGIC EVENTS ON SCHOOLYARDS PLAYGROUNDS AND PLACES THAT WE WORSHIP. PLACES THAT WE EAT AT EVENTS THAT WE SOCIALIZE BIRTHDAY PARTIES. WHEN DO WE SAY WE'RE NOT SAFE. AND AT EVERY FEW WEEKS WE HEAR YET ANOTHER INCIDENT MANY TIMES THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE NEWS ANYMORE. MANY TIMES SOMEBODY WHO WAS KILLED WITH A GUN IF IT'S ONE PERSON IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE NEWS. PARTICULARLY IN OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. NOW I'M FROM ORANGE COUNTY IN ORANGE COUNTY PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TAXES. AND I'VE SAID NO TO EVERY TAX SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. AND ALSO A MORE NO TO MORE TAXES BUT IN THIS CASE I SAY YES BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE. A STAND TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO START TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS UN VIOLENCE WHERE NOW ARE YOUNG KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN HAVE TO GO TO ACTIVE SHOOTER TRAINING. ON OUR CAMPUSES. AS A TEACHER FOR THIRTY YEARS I HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT TRAINING. TO ACTUALLY TEACH CHILDREN NOT TO DUCK AND COVER FROM EARTHQUAKES. BUT HOW TO HIDE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR CAMPUSES LOOK LIKE WHEN WE GET THAT SIGNAL THAT THERE'S AN ACTIVE SHOOTER ON CAMPUS SO I STAND IN SUPPORT OF TWELVE TWENTY THREE AND ASK FOR YOUR I. A BOAT. THANK YOU MISS CLARK SILVA MISSED POWER K. HAVE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I DON'T THINK I COULD LAY OUT THE PROBLEM ANY BETTER THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON DID COMING FROM COMMUNITY PLAGUED. I GUN VIOLENCE BUT I KNOW. THAT ALL SEVENTY NINE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE GUN VIOLENCE. MINE PROBABLY HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST RATES OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS HOUSE. AND YET JUST THIS YEAR A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE LOST HER HUSBAND TO GUN VIOLENCE. WELL HER SON WATCHED. HE RAN INTO THE FOREST IN HOPES OF FLEEING FROM THE MAN WHO IS SHOOTING AT THEM. AND THEN HID FOR DAYS UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND HIM. WILL NEVER COVER. THIS IS A REAL I LIKE MY COLLEAGUES ORANGE COUNTY COME FROM A DISTRICT. THE DOESN'T LIKE HOW MUCH WE TAX PEOPLE I VOTE AGAINST ALMOST EVERY TAXES WELL. UNLIKE MY COLLEAGUE IN OAKLAND. BUT EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE. WE SEE A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO STEP UP AND SAY WE WILL DO WHAT IT TAKES WE WILL PAY FOR THIS PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED WE WILL SAVE MOTHERS FROM HAVING TO HOLD THEIR DYING. CHILDREN WE WILL SAVE CHILDREN LIKE MINE. FROM LEARNING TO HIDE. THEY'RE CALLING FOR ORANGE COUNTY TALKED ABOUT. BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE HUNTED IN THEIR CLASSROOMS WHERE THEY SHOULD BE SAFEST. THIS IS OUR MOMENT TO SAY YES TO SOMETHING THAT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE PROBABLY CURRENT COUNTIES HARD. BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WELL ACTUALLY I JUST WANNA ADD IT'S ALSO THE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO OTHER STATES THAT HAVE FUNDED THESE CALVET PROGRAMS HAVE SHOWN THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND ON THESE PROGRAMS WE SAVE THIRTEEN DOLLARS. IN HOSPITAL COSTS AND PUBLIC SAFETY COSTS SO WE'RE SPENDING TO SAVE MONEY. SO NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM ON THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM IF YOU ARE FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE IF YOU'RE A LIBERAL THIS IS SMART TO FISCAL POLICY. BUT IT WILL SAVE LIVES AND IT WILL SAVE CALIFORNIANS AND COLLEAGUES LIKE OURS FROM CURSING CAN SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT KNOWING THEIR CHILDREN WON'T BE SHOCKED. WALKING DOWN THE STREET I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABBOTT. THERE IS BURKE A HEY MR GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE I WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM RAN FROM HAVING THE COURAGE TO BRING THIS FORWARD. I VERY LITTLE TOWN TO THE ELOQUENT COMMENTS THAT SO MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE ABOUT THIS MEASURE- BUT I DID JUST WANT RESPECTFULLY. RESPOND TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM A COLLEAGUE FROM BY SALIA. IT'S TRUE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER UNDERLYING ROOT CAUSES OF GUN VIOLENCE. POVERTY INEQUALITY. SUFFERING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. BUT THOSE PROBLEMS ARE ALL TOO PERSISTENT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND YET THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE IS A UNIQUELY AMERICAN PHENOMENON. CHILDREN ARE KILLED IN THIS COUNTRY IN A WAY THAT THEY ARENOT KILLED. IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH. SO IF THIS WAS JUST ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IF THIS WAS JUST ABOUT POVERTY IF THIS WAS JUST ABOUT INEQUALITY. THEN WE WOULD BE IN THE SAME BOAT AS EVERY OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH. BUT WE'RE NOT WE HAVE HEARD THAT SPOKEN SO POWERFULLY BY OUR COLLEAGUES. ABOUT THE WAY THAT IT PLAYED TO PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ABOUT THE WAY THAT IT PLACE PEOPLE IN HIGH INCOME COMMUNITIES ABOUT HOW STUDENTS ARE FREE TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE LIVES I AM MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT THIS INVOLVES TWO THINGS THAT OUR RADIO ACTIVE IN OUR POLITICS RIGHT NOW. THE WORD TAXES IN THE WORD GUNS. BUT YOU HAVE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY MENTIONED. TO SHOW COURAGE I WANT TO COMMEND OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM A WINDOW. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW COURAGE AND SAVE LIVES. IT'S HARD RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES I KNOW THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT ABOUT. PEOPLE ARE MINDFUL OF THE POLITICS AROUND THIS VOTE BUT WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT WORK. YOU WILL SAVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY VOTING FOR THIS BILL. NO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK IMAGE GABRIEL. MR MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS SON AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY NOTED THIS IS ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE THIS IS ABOUT TAXATION AND THIS IS ABOUT. THE SECOND AMENDMENT I'LL GET TO THAT TO THE LAST TWO IN A MINUTE BUT I WOULD GUESS THAT EVERY SEVENTY NINE PEOPLE UP HERE WANT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF GUN VIOLENCE. WITH THEIR IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES WHETHER THEY'RE BECAUSE OF SUICIDE OR VETERANS THEIR WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE LOST. UNNECESSARILY AT THE AT THE HANDS OF GUN VIOLENCE A FIRE ARE MANY TIMES. IN SOMEONE'S HANDS WHO WE ALL AGREE SHOULDN'T HAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE. I REMEMBER AS A YOUNG COUNCIL MEMBER JUST A FEW BLOCKS IN YOUR EYES TO GET THESE CALLS MAYBE. EVERY OTHER MONTH FROM OUR EITHER OUR POLICE CHIEF. OR THE CAPTAIN IN MY CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT AND EVERY TIME THAT PHONE RANG. I DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER THE CALL BECAUSE I KNEW THERE ARE CALLING FOR ONE REASON. A YOUNG MAN OST LIKELY. YOUNG BROWN A BLACK MAN WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN MY DISTRICT. AND I THOUGHT THIS IS WAY TOO MUCH WHAT COULD WE DO. SO I THOUGHT TWO THINGS ONE WE WORKED ON A LOT OF REGULATE AMMUNITION SALES WITH LATER BECAME THE MODEL FOR CALIFORNIA AND TO. I THOUGHT WHAT CAN WE DO TO SPEND RESOURCES ON RESEARCH DATA DRIVEN EFFORTS THAT PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. WE HAVE A PROGRAM IGHT HERE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE CAL THE CALVET PROGRAM FUNDS ADVANCE PEACE WHICH WE KNOW WORKS. WHICH WE KNOW WORKS. OUR COLLEAGUE MORAN IS BRING THIS ISSUE UP SIGN TO ISSUE MY PREDECESSOR OFFERED THIS BILL FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT NOW THE TIME THAT WE CAN REALLY TAKE A LOOK AS FAR AS WHAT. REALLY WORKS TO STOP THE FLOW OF GUNS TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND STOP GUN VIOLENCE. SO LET'S GET BACK TO THE ISSUE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. SO THE LETTERSIN THE OPPOSITION SAYS THIS IS A RIGHT THEY CAN'T BE INFRINGED UPON. WE'RE NOT INFRINGING UPON IT. YOU CAN STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE A FIREARM. AMMUNITION. SO WE GET TO TAXATION WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME PRODUCTS IN SOCIETY WHICH WE PAY SALES TAX FOR BUT IS ALSO IMPACTS AS WELL. SOME PRODUCTS HAVE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES WHICH TO PAY AN EXTRA TAX ON. THINK ABOUT TV'S. BATTERIES PAINT MATTRESSES YOU PAY SALES TAX AND YOU PAY A FEW EXTRA PENNIES PER DOLLAR PER PURCHASE WHY BECAUSE SALES TAX IS NOT ENOUGH. TO ADDRESS THE CARNAGE THAT THAT TAKES PLACE BECAUSE OF THIS PRODUCT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT ALL AMMUNITION AND GUN SALES COULD PROVIDE NEGATIVE THINGS IN SOCIETY. A LOT OF TIMES THEY DO AND SO A LITTLE EXTRA FOR YOUR PURCHASE. WHAT COULD I DO IT COULD STOP A DEATH IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS NEIGHBORS OF CARSON IT COULD ALSO STOP SUICIDE. THESE MONIES CAN E SPENT ON RESEARCH DRIVEN EFFORTS TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT SOME CRAZY CRAZY IDEA SURE THERE IS SALES TAX CURRENTLY ON FIREARM SALES HANDGUNS LONG GUNS AND AMMUNITION. BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A- LONG TERM REVENUE STREAM TO PAY FOR EFFORTS THAT WORK. AGAIN OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY WORKED HARD TO GET INTO A PREPARATION THE BUDGET LAST FEW YEARS. AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THESE PROGRAMS WORK AND REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. ASKING RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY MEMBERS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW. IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES. MR SAY ARE TELL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES SO I HAD SOME PREPARED COMMENTS BUT I'M GONNA LEAVE THOSE DOWN FOR NOW. I HAVE TO STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. FOR ONE THING WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT CALVET AND THAT'S A GREAT PROGRAM AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE AND IT SHOULD BE FUNDED WHAT WE SHOULD USE DEFINED IT AS SOMETHING THAT OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY IN CALIFORNIA. HAS ALREADY ALREADY GIVEN TO AND THAT'S OUR TAXES WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT BILLION EXTRA DOLLARS THAT WE DID NOT KNOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT WE CAN FUND THIS PROGRAM AS MUCH AS WE WANT IF THIS IS THAT IMPORTANT THEN LET'S DO IT. BUT TRYING TO TAX AND A TEN AND 11% RATE. A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE IS GOING TO DO THIS IT'S GOING TO DRIVE THOSE PEOPLE OUT. THEY WILL DIVIDE THEIR THEIR GUNS ON THE BLACK MARKET OR THEY WILL BY- IN ARIZONA OR NEVADA OR WHEREVER IT IS AND YOU WILL NOT SEE THAT REVENUE. SO IF THIS IS IMPORTANT. FOR PETE'S SAKE FUNDING. THAT'S WHAT THAT THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO. DON'T STAND HERE AND TELL US THAT IT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE IT IS. WE WANT GUN VIOLENCE TO BE REDUCED TO NOTHING ZERO. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT WITH THE PROGRAM THE ALL IT DOES IS SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAX THESE FOLKS 10% OR ELEVEN PERCENT. FOR EXERCISING THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT. FOR PETE'S SAKE THAT'S JUST A PUNISHMENT FOR DOING THAT. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT THOSE PEOPLE WILL GO AWAY. WELL WON'T SUPPLY THE MONEY THAT YOU WANT. SO THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TODAY IF YOU WANT TO FIND IT FUNDING WE GOT A FEW DAYS UNTIL THE FIFTEENTH OF JUNE TAKE IT UP TO THE GOVERNOR SAY THIS PROGRAM IS SUPER IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS. AND FUND THE THING. MR FRAZIER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- I'VE BEEN A GUN OWNER AND SHOOTER FOR FIFTY YEARS MY FATHER TAUGHT ME WHEN I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD. AND I PROBABLY HAVE MORE GUNS THAN MOST OF THE REPUBLICANS IN HERE. AND I PROBABLY SHOOT A LOT MORE TO- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNING TO ME AS WE HAVE NEVER TAKEN THE APPROACH. OF THE MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT WE ALWAYS PERSECUTE THE GUN OR THE GUN OWNER. BUT WE HAVE NEVER REALLY TAKEN A CONCERTED EFFORT BY LOOKING OUT WHAT MENTAL CAPACITY WE NEED TO APPROACH OF BEING ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE ON THIS FIGHT. AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE. IT'S ABSURD THAT WE KEEP THROWING MONEY AT THINGS AND WE GET VERY MINIMAL RESULTS AND I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATORS ARE MINIMAL RESULTS. WHAT I'M SAYING IS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WAR ON DRUGS. IT'S A VISIBLE ONLY LOOK AT THE WAR ON ANYTHING. WE JUST THROW MONEY AT IT AND NEVER HAVE A METRIC PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING WITH. ANTICIPATED EXPECTED OUTCOMES. WHAT I'M HOPING FOR. IS THE AUTHOR. IS IT THAT IT'S MOVES OUT TODAY WILL COMMIT. TO WORKING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL COMPONENT IN THE BUDGET AND THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE PROFESSIONALS TO SEEK OUT A SOLUTION. TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOWARDS AN ABSOLUTE. PLAN THAT IS SCRIPTED AND PRESCRIPTIVE AND WITH ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES A BRINGS US A VALUE. UNBELIEVABLY AGAIN AS I'VE SAID BEFORE THE PEOPLE THAT USE GUNS RECREATIONALLY. ARE NOT A PROBLEM IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH- ANGER ISSUES OKAY. I USED TO FEED MY FAMILY I HUNTING. I CAN'T ANYMORE. BECAUSE I WORK HERE AND WE'RE ALWAYS HERE. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN SUNDAY. I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT ALSO THE AUTHOR. COMMITS. TO SOME KIND OF TRACKING METHODOLOGY STATEWIDE. THAT IF IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE. THAT IT IS A PILOT PROGRAM. AND IT DOES REVERT BACK BECAUSE THESE THINGS IN PERPETUITY. THEY HAVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN AND IF WE DON'T SAY THAT IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY IT'LL CONTINUE JUST TO OF ALL. INTO SOMETHING ELSE. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD. AND RESERVE THE RIGHT TO RESERVE THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE TO WHAT I'M ASKING FOR. IN THE SENATE. AND WHEN IT COMES BACK HERE FOR CONCURRENCE I WILL. CHANGE MY VOTE. I HAVE NEVER VOTED ON A GUN BILL IN THIS HOUSE AS A DEMOCRAT. BECAUSE I'VE FOUGHT AT ALL TIMES WE HAVE DONE THIS ABSOLUTELY WRONG THIS MAY BE THE CHANCE. THIS VERY WELL MAY BE THE CHANCE. AND IF WE CAN GET THAT MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT AND PLANNED BACKWARDS I'M ALL IN I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS FRAZIER SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. ON THE ITEM MR LEVINE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS- FOR THIS DEEPLY MOVING. FLOOR DEBATE. FOR THE HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH YOU OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS ABOUT THIS BILL- IN PARTICULAR MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLEY- DEEPLY MEANINGFUL AND TRANSFORMATIVE. CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND- AND HIS VIEWS ON HOW WE CAN DO BETTER AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND ALSO WITH THE TRAGEDIES THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS WEEK THAT REPEAT AND REPEAT AND REPEAT HOW WE HONOR THE MEMORIES. OF OUR FALLEN HEROES- INFRSTR SPONSORS WHO ARE CAUGHT UP IN THIS TRAGIC VIOLENCE LIKE SO MANY. VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE. TOO MANY SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE. TOO MANY PEOPLE JUST LIVING THEIR DAILY LIFE. WE'VE HEARD THE SAID BEFORE TODAY HOW TOUGH AND DIFFICULT THIS VOTE IS FOR SO MANY OF US AND IT'S REALLY ALL OF US WE HAVE IN FACT SINCE I WAS FIRST ELECTED CONDITIONED NOT TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. IN IN PARTICULAR. AS ABOUT HALF OF THIS ROOMY RECALL WHEN OUR PERSONAL ADDRESSES WERE PUT PUBLISHED ONLINE. BY GUN RIGHTS ADVOCATES SAYING THAT DATE THAT THOSE ADDRESSES WOULD ONLY BE REMOVED ONCE WE WERE REMOVED FROM OFFICE. A CHILLING. MESSAGE TO ALL OF US. AND THAT WE CAN SHOW THAT WE WILL NOT BE BULLIED BY THAT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN CONDITIONED. NEVER TO VOTE FOR THAT DREADED Të WORD. WITH A RISK OF OUR OFFICE- BECAUSE OF IT. BUT THIS IS SUCH A NARROWLY TAILORED BILL MODELED AFTER A FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT EVEN MITCH MCCONNELL OR PAUL RYAN WHEN THEY LED CONGRESS NEVER WORKED TO REPEAL. THAT BAY KEPT THAT MONEY COMING TO WASHINGTON EVEN WHEN REPUBLICANS CONTROLLED. CONGRESS WE CAN DO THE SAME THING FOR CALIFORNIA KEEP THAT MONEY IN CALIFORNIA AND WE CAN CHANGE LIVES WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE A PATH IN SOCIETY WHERE THEY'RE NOT CAUSING HARM WERE THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVE ALTERNATIVES TO GUN VIOLENCE WHERE THEY INSTEAD OF CAUSING PAIN IN THEIR COMMUNITY CAN BE PRODUCTIVE. IN THEIR COMMUNITY. MEMBERS THIS VOTE THIS BILL WILL NOT GET FIFTY FOUR VOTES. IF YOU DON'T PRESS THAT GREEN BUTTON. I NEED YOU TO PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON. THIS ISN'T A BILL THAT WE JUST WATCH UP THERE. AND SEE IT UP THERE. AND IT'S NOT SOME NUMBER. BUT IT DOESN'T NEED YOU TO PRESS THIS BUTTON SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO PRESS THAT BUTTON.

THIRTY ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE BY MISTER MURATSUCHI. THE CLERK WILL READ ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE IN THE GREENHOUSE GASES THIS RESEARCH EMAIL. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CRISIS ACT. LAST APRIL PRESIDENT BIDEN CONVENE LEADERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE GLOBAL CLIMATE SUMMIT. TO ADDRESS A CRISIS THAT IS FACING. ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN THIS LEGISLATURE. AS WELL AS ALL COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD. PRESIDENT BIDEN MADE A BOLD CALL TO ALL AMERICANS. TO CUT OUR NATION'S EMISSIONS IN HALF AND LESS THAN TEN YEARS. IN ORDER TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR OWN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THIS DATE AND THIS TARGET. IT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR IF WE BELIEVE THE SCIENTISTS. WE KNOW THAT IF WE DON'T REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY. BYOR BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE WILL MISS THE POINT OF NO RETURN. I REMEMBER GOVERNOR BROWN'S DOOMSDAY CLOCK. BUT THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK IS TICKING. AND WE NEED TO HAVE THAT SENSE OF URGENCY THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN AND LEADERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD ARE CALLING FOR. IF WE MISS THIS POINT OF NO RETURN. WHERE ARE PLANET OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. AND THOSE OF US WHO STILL MAY BE ALIVE. I MAY NOT BE AROUND BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE IN SITTING IN FRONT OF ME AND MANY OTHERS HOPEFULLY WILL BE. BUT THOSE OF US WHO ARE STILL ALIVE WILL SUFFER MASSIVELY. IF WE DON'T TURN THE DIRECTION. OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. ALREADY WE ARE SEEING TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS TOO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS SUFFERING FROM THE ALREADY UNFOLDING A FAX OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. EVERY YEAR MORE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES MORE LIVES LOST MORE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC DAMAGES SMOKE FILLED ORANGE SKIES RAINING ASK THAT OUR CHILDREN IS BREEDING IN. MEGA DROUGHTS IS AFFECTING FARMING COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS EVERYONE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND OF COURSE EXTREME HEAT. A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES IN THOUSAND OAKS A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES I DON'T KNOW HOW WHAT THE TEMPERATURE IS IN YUCCA VALLEY. SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO WHAT CAN WE DO. HERE TODAY. AS MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. AS THE LEGISLATURE THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. TO TURN. THIS TIDE. AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THIS BILL PROPOSES THREE MAIN ACTIONS. ONE IS TO CODIFY. OR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY OR BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WITH THE NET NEGATIVE EMISSIONS THEREAFTER. TO REQUIRE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THROUGH A LESS THAN A FRAMEWORK THIS BILL PROVIDES TO CREATE THE ROADMAP ON HOW WE GET TO THE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. COMBINED WITH ANY AND ALL CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE INNOVATORS IN OUR STATE CAN COME UP WITH THE LET ME FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE OF THE CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FALSE NARRATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT OUT THERE BY THE OPPONENTS TO THIS BILL. NOTHING IN THIS BILL LIMITS CARBON CAPTURE AND TECHNOLOGY. I MEAN IF ILAN MOSQUE OR ANYONE ELSE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUCK UP ALL THE CARBON IN OUR ATMOSPHERE. TO SAVE THE PLANET MORE POWER TO THEM THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT LIMITS CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY. AND I WILL COMMIT TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM HEY WORD AND TO EVERYONE. THAT WE WILL CLARIFY THAT COMMITMENT IN THE LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LIMIT. WHY WOULD I OR ANYONE WANT TO LIMIT INNOVATION TO SAVE THE PLANET THAT IS COMPLETELY A FALSE NARRATIVE THAT OPPONENTS ARE PUTTING OUT THERE. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. FAMOUS VERSES YOU MISS GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SOUTH COAST. SOUTH BAY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL AS WELL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FALSE NARRATIVES OUT THERE IN THAT SENSE OF URGENCY IS THAT THE REALITIES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE IT'S REAL. AND IT'S AFFECTING US NOW AND IT'S ONLY GETTING WORSE IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE I DEALING WITH THE BIGGEST BURDEN BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN THE LEAST LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE HEAT ISLAND THAT I LIVE AND IT'S NOT THAT IT GETS SO HOT IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T HAVE A CONDITIONER AND THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE. IT'S THAT WHEN IT GETS SO HOT THAT ALL THE TOXIC THAT I COUNTY TALK ABOUT THEY GAVE BACK THEY GET BAKED IN AND THEY GET STRONGER AND WE GET SICKER AND WE'RE DYING SOONER OUT THERE. IS IT WHEN YOU TAKE ACTION NOW AND THIS BILL IS ABOUT BEING SENSIBLE IT'S ABOUT SAYING THAT FIRST WE NEED TO HAVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE INTO THE CITY INTO THE SPACE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT 90% REDUCTIONS THAT'S NOT A RANDOM NUMBER IT'S WHAT THE STUDY THAT HAS BEEN- CONDUCTED HERE BUT IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD ALREADY. OUT THERE AND SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE CARBON NEUTRALLY THE REALITIES THAT WE NEED NEGATIVE EMISSIONS MEANING THAT WE NEED TO NOT JUST REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE CARBON WE'RE PUTTING OUT TODAY BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL THE CARBON THAT'S ALREADY OUT THERE THAT GOT US TO THIS POINT ALREADY. SO THAT THEY CAN OLOGY IS NEEDED WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT DEFINITELY IN THAT IT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES OUT THERE WE ARE CURRENTLY BEING TOLD THAT WE HAVE TO PICK THESE FALSE NARRATIVES. BETWEEN ONE AND THE OTHER AND THE REALITY IS THAT THIS IS THE FIFTH BIGGEST CASE STATE BECAUSE WE'RE INNOVATIVE BECAUSE WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT AND I HAVE THAT FAITH. AND SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU MISS GARCIA MIS READ. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE I SUPPORTED THIS AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. AND I'M EXCITED TO SUPPORT THIS AGAIN ON THE FLOOR. OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WOULD CODIFY A CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL FOR TWENTY FORTY FIVE. BILL CLIMATE CHANGE. AS WE ALL KNOW IS FUELING ENVIRONMENTAL. DEGRADATION AND SEA LEVEL RISE WEATHER EXTREMES SUCH AS HE DROUGHT FOOD- AND WATER AND SECURITY. IT'S TIME FOR US TO CONTINUE TAKING BOLD COLLECTIVE ACTION. AND I REALLY BELIEVE. THAT THIS BILL WOULD HELP US IN THAT DIRECTION I READ YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE. THANK OF HIS RIVASDR QUIRK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE FRANKLY I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR WEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THIS BILL BECAUSE WE GET ONE STORY FROM ONE GROUP AND ONE FROM ANOTHER. AND I WAS SITTING DOWN WITH THE MEMBER FROM RANCHO CORDOVA. THIS MORNING AND WE WERE LOOKING AT IT AND TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND I WENT TO THE MEMBER FROM TORRANCE AND I SAID LOOK. THIS SECTION AND IT'S FREE. SECTION THREE IN ITS ON PAGE THREE OF PRIORITIZE THE USE OF NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY. AND THE DIFFICULTY WAS WITH ME BUT NOW IT'S NOW IT'S NOW IT'S GOING TO WORK ON IT IS IT'S HARD TO INTERPRET WHAT PRIORITIZE MEANS SO I'VE ASKED HIM TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT LANGUAGE HE'S GOING TO DO THAT. SO I WOULD STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE FOR THIS BECAUSE FRANKLY ONE OF THE REASONS I CAME HERE WAS TO WORK ON THIS ONE IS TO HAVE THESE GOALS AND YOU ACHIEVE THEM. AND I AM THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH MR MERECE SU CHI OR EXCUSE ME WITH THE MEMBER FROM TAURUSES PLEDGE THANK YOU. MR GALLAGHER. YOU'RE A CHANCE. YEAH THANK YOU MEMBERS- AND MISTER SPEAKER- FIRST OF ALL I I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE IN THIS DISCUSSION ON THIS FLOOR. ABOUT WHAT POLICY SHOULD BE ABOUT WHAT- BENCHMARKS WE SHOULD BE SETTING BECAUSE LATELY THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN THE ONE MAKING THAT DECISION HIMSELF. INSTEAD OF THIS BODY. I JUST WANT TO BEGIN WITH THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD BE THE ONES ESTABLISHING WHAT THE POLICY IS. AND WHAT THE TARGETS ARE. AB THIRTY TWO WAS LEGISLATION. IT STARTED IN THIS HOUSE BUT LATELY WE'VE BEEN ALLOWING THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR US THAT'S WRONG. IN THIS BODY SHOULD HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN PUSHING BACK AGAINST THAT. AND SAY NO GOVERNOR YOU DON'T GET TO LEGISLATE. IT'S BEEN ONE OF MY GREATEST FRUSTRATIONS AND I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING I JUST REALLY EMPLOYER THIS BODY PLEASE. PLEASE PUSH BACK. STOP LETTING THIS GOVERNOR BE THE ONE THAT MAKES THESE DECISIONS FOR THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT WHEN ELECTRIC CARS YOU KNOW WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO BE SOLD. WHEN AG EQUIPMENT. WILL HAVE TO BE TOTALLY ZERO EMISSION WHICH IS RIGHT BY THE WAY RIGHT NOW NOT EVEN POSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE. TO HAVE THE AG EQUIPMENT THAT MAKES YOUR THAT BRINGS FOOD TO YOUR TABLE. AND AROUND THE WORLD. IS BANNED BY THIS BY A GOVERNOR BY AN EDICT. SO I'M GLAD WE'RE HAD AT LEAST HAVING THIS DISCUSSION THE LEGISLATURE WERE ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE ENTIRE STATE. CAN HELP DETERMINE THIS. BUT A FORTUNE I THINK THIS THIS BILL FOR IN PARTICULAR IS WRONG SIDE AND HERE'S WHY. I THINK CARBON NEUTRALITY IS A GREAT GOAL FOR US TO BE A- BUT LIKE WITH. MANY THINGS WHERE WE'VE GONE WRONG WE HAVEN'T ALLOWED THE MARKET. AND WE HAVEN'T ALLOWED THE FULL AMOUNT OF INNOVATION TO GET US THERE. YOU KNOW BY THE WAY WE'VE DONE ALL THIS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE IS CHINA. WHERE IS INDIA WHERE'S THE DEMANDS ON THESE OTHER COUNTRIES AND STATES WHO ARE MUCH GREATER CARBON EMITTER IS THAN ALL OF US. MEANWHILE ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS OF HAVE HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT. OF THIS IN COST. COST OF LIVING FOR ABILITY. AND WE JUST KEEP STACKING IT ON WALL WE HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS OF ANYBODYELSE TO MEET THEIR GOALS. WHERE IS THE TEETH WERE AS THE TEETH ON ON A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA WE HAVE WE DO NOT DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY ON THEIR PART. WE DON'T DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY ON OTHER STATES TO MEET THEIR- THEIR LEVELS MEANWHILE YOU KEEP STACKING ON US. AND THEN I WILL GET TO THE ISSUE OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION BECAUSE THERE IS. A LOT OF INNOVATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW- CARBON SEQUESTRATION TECHNOLOGY AND THIS BILL DOES NOT OF IT RESTRICTS IT. IT DOES RESTRICTED. AND WHY IS NOT A PROBLEM TWO REASONS. THAT'S BLUE COLLAR JOBS IS GOING TO COST YOU THAT'S WHY LABOR HAS BEEN AGAINST THIS BILL. BECAUSE YOU HAVE BLUE COLLAR JOBS IN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY THE COULD BE PART OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY SO. SOLUTION THROUGH CARBON SQUESTRATION TECHNOLOGY THAT HELPS TAKE THAT CARBON OUT OF THE AIR IT'S A QUESTION IT BACK IN THE GROUND THE NUMBER TWO AND I'LL THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART A MINUTE MOST IMPORTANT POINT I'M GONNA AND WITH. BIOMASS RIGHT NOW IT UC BERKELEY RESEARCHERS ARE FINDING WAYS TO TAKE BIOMASS TECHNOLOGY AND SEQUESTER COMPLETELY IN THE GROUND AND WE HAVE A WILD FIRE PROBLEM. WE HAVE A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE SHOULD BE WORKING WITH THOSE RESEARCHERS TO HAVE A BIOMASS PLANT ALL AROUND THE FOOTHILLS. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THESE FUELS OUT OF THE FOREST. BURN THEM AND THEN SEQUESTER THEM. IN THE GROUND THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT. AND WE SHOULDN'T BLOCK THAT INNOVATION. AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE WE SHOULD VOTE THIS BILL DOWN TODAY. WE THINK WE CAN DO BETTER WE CAN HAVE A BETTER POLICY AND IT SHOULD BE CREATED BY ALL OF US. BY INPUT FROM ALL OF US. IN ALL THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THIS AND YOU PAY THE COST OF THIS. AND NO LONGER BY ONE MAN. THANK YOU MEMBERS. MR COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. HI I HAD A REAL PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL REALLY BEFORE THE AMENDMENTS IN MAY. I SAW IT IS INDEED RESTRICTING. TECHNOLOGY BASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION 210% AND MADE ME ASK MYSELF WHY WOULD ARE WE BECOMING LUDDITES AND CALIFORNIA ANTI TECHNOLOGY THE HOME OF TECHNOLOGY SO PRODUCTIVE AN ECONOMY BUT THAT THAT ACTUALLY LIMITATION CAME OUT IN MAY. SO THAT BRINGS ME BACK TO THE BILL AND SHE- AND IT SAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO- SET THIS BIG STRETCH GOAL OF REDUCING CARBON REMOVING IT FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. THAT IT IT DOES INDEED PRIORITIZE NATURAL MEANS OF DOING THAT. BUT IT DOES NOT CRAM DOWN AND LIMIT OF EFFORTS TO REMOVE CARBON FROM SORT OF THE PIPELINE BEFORE TEN THE ATMOSPHERE FOR EXAMPLE 210% AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME ACTUALLY THAT EXISTING LAW. I'VE GOT IT HERE ON MY DESK HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION THREE EIGHT FIVE SIX ONE. ALREADY PERMITS UNDER THE MAKE ALL THE UNDER THE ALL IMPORTANT SCOPING PLAN THAT AIR BE ADMINISTERS RECOGNITION OF. COURTESY QUESTION PROJECTS AND BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SO ALREADY THE LAW ALLOWS AND RECOGNIZES THAT THESE SORTS OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION PROJECTS FIT WITHIN THE AIR BE SCOPING PLAN THIS BILL WILL ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE- I THINK WE DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON HOW THE A. R. B. ADMINISTERS THESE PROVISIONS. BUT I SEE IT AS A STRETCH GOAL. WITH AN EMPHASIS UPON NATURAL SYSTEMS FOUR REMOVED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE BUT ALSO CARBON SEQUESTRATION SERVER OPERATIVE PLANTED YOU CAN DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE THE FROM BORN IN THE ATMOSPHERE I DO THINK THAT. THERE'S A BASIS FOR RECOGNIZE THAT IN THIS BILL AND UNDER EXISTING LAW AND I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S A PLACE WHERE INNOVATORS CAN FOCUS ON SPECIFIC INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS THE REVERSAL PROCESS SEES AND LOOK AT HOW THEY DISTRICT CARVED OUT AT THAT STAGE BEFORE. GOES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. I THINK THAT ACTUALLY FITS WITH. A PROBLEM OF THIS MAGNITUDE WE NEED EVERY ARROW IN OUR QUIVER. AND I THINK PULL IT OUT OF THE AIR IS GOOD BUT I THINK PULLING IT OUT OF. THE PIPELINE BEFORE GOES OUT THE SMOKESTACK IS ALSO GOOD I THINK THAT'S A PLACE WHERE TECHNOLOGY CAN PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE. AND SO I'M URGEN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. I FIGUERAS COOLEY MISTER MAYES YOUR RECOGNIZE AT YOUR DESK I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I MEMBERS I WASN'T PLANNING ON A SPEAKING ON THIS ITEM BUT JUST- AFTER HEARING FROM- FROM SOME OF YOU I THOUGHT I WOULD STAND. AND I'D SAY A FEW WORDS- I'M ACTUALLY VERY GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AND- A DEBATE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR SOME TIME YOU KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN A CONVERT- I WAS A- A CLIMATE SKEPTIC- WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED. AND THEN WHAT FROM BECOMING A CLIMATE A CLIMATE SKEPTIC AS BECOMING SOMEBODY WHO IS A FIRM BELIEVER. THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY I TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TALK ABOUT THOSE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES. WELL GUESS WHAT THERE ARE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THAT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THOUGH THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS. AT TODAY AND THE REASON I'M NOT SUPPORTING THIS TODAY IS BECAUSE IT DOES PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS- I AM SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULDN'T JUST GET TO NET NEUTRAL. WE HAVE TO GET TO NET NEGATIVE AND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE EVERY SINGLE TECHNOLOGY AT OUR DISPOSAL TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE. A **** AND IT IS OUR RIGHT I WANTED TO SPEAK TO MY GOOD FRIEND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE OR- BOTH SIDES THE AISLE I GET TO SAY THAT ON HOW TO DO THAT. AND NOW BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE- I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS. THIS FOR YEARS BUT- THERE IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE I'M SOME OF THE BELIEVES IN BOTH LIBERTY. AND RESPONSIBILITY AND THIS IS ONE OF THESE THE THESE ISSUES THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SHOULD DO BECAUSE IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND WE DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR CHINA BUT TO BE ABLE TO STEP UP IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE HOWEVER. THIS IS PICKING. WINNERS AND LOSERS THE TERM PRIORITIZE OR FOR THAT MATTER EXCLUDING- THAT CARBON CAPTURE WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL. ALL TECHNOLOGIES TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE AND UNFORTUNATELY. THE DOESN'T US THERE I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US OVER THE SUMMER AND EVEN IN THE FALL. TO HOPEFULLY WORK IN A TRI PARTISAN WAY. TO COME UP WITH A WITH. A REAL COHESIVE PLAN. AND GET RID OF ALL THE POLITICAL TALK. TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. ISSUE AND I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. IN DOING SO. TAKE THIS RACE MEMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK ON THE ADAM RAZOR MAKES NOW. RAZORBACK FUNDS NOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE ON THIS ITEM MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AYE AYE TO IS NOT GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS BUT- LISTENING TO THE DEBATE. AND FRANKLY REFLECTING BACK ON THE HELL I'VE GONE THROUGH PERSONALLY ON MY VOTE ON CAP AND TRADE- THE- FEEL COMPELLED TO. YOU KNOW A LOT A FEW OF US FRANKLY TO MEMBERS OF THIS BODY OF TAKING PERSONAL TIME TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT ENERGY OF SCHOOL FOR LEGISLATORS- I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THEM IF THEY CAN A LOT OF PERSONAL TIME. TO LEARN. ABOUT THIS ISSUE TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO DIVERSE A FIVE OUR PORTFOLIO TO BE SMART. ABOUT HOW WE GO AFTER CLIMATE CHANGE. WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT 76% OF CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL IN THESE TO BE AFFECTED. HOWEVER WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AND A DUTY TO BE SMART AND EFFECTIVE IN OUR APPROACH. AND I AGREE. WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DESERT AREA- TRYING TO MAKE THINGS TRY PARTISAN. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. AND WE HAVE THIS LIBERTY THAT WE HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS. BUT WE ARE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THIS BILL. MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICHOLAS BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT. ABOUT BIOMASS. ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE CAN SEQUESTER CARBON DID THE BURNING FRANKLY MORE MORE SO THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN OUR STATE IS AFFECTING US IT'S RAINING ASH IT IS RAINED ASH IN MY DISTRICT. EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE HAD FOREST FIRES SINCE BEFORE FOREST FIRES WERE A COLD POPULAR THING TO TALK ABOUT ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. WE HAVE SMART AND CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO GO ABOUT DOING THIS. ONE OF THINGS I HAVEN'T HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT IS ABOUT HYDROGEN FUEL AND HYDROGEN FUTURES JUST THIS WEEK. A TOYOTA CAR THE SIZE OF THE CAMERAS DOWN IN THE BASEMENT OF A LOT OF YOU CRUISE AROUND IN. BROKE THE LAN MILES RECORD TRAVELED. ON HYDROGEN. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HYDROGEN FUEL SOLUTIONS INSTEAD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ELECTRIFICATION AND BATTERIES AND THAT'S IT. EVEN THOUGH THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL SAYS NATURAL WAYS. LET'S BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE GO AFTER. CARBON SEQUESTRATION LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS LET'S MAKE SURE THAT ARE INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE OUR STATE AND PROVIDE THESE JOBS WERE OR TALK ABOUT BRINGING JOBS BACK. AFTER COVE IT BUT YET WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. MEMBERS WERE SMARTER THAN THIS WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICOLAS SAID LET'S LET'S ALL GET TOGETHER LET'S GET AROUND THE TABLE AND HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION. AND FIGURE OUT WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE OUR INDUSTRIES TO MOVE FORWARD. SO WE CAN HAVE THAT DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO THAT WE ALL NEED. SO WE CAN HAVE THAT BETTER BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN ASKING FOR NO VOTE. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. ON THE BILL MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I AGAIN WANT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IF IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH NOW IT WILL BE MORE CLEAR. WHEN WE AMEND THE LANGUAGE IN THE SENATE. WE ARE NOT WE HAVE NO I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AMONG TECHNOLOGY. F. ILAN MUSK AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUCK UP ALL THE CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE MORE POWER TO HIM. WE DO NOT WANT TO. DISCOURAGE ANY KIND OF INNOVATION IN TERMS OF CAN'T CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE AND SO YOU KNOW I ASK A- MY COLLEAGUES TO STOP SPREADING THIS FALSE NARRATIVE THAT THAT WE ARE- WE WHERE SOMEHOW LIMITING INNOVATION. THAT THE BOTTOM LINE THE REASON WHY. BIG OIL AND- WORKERS AND THE UNIONS THAT REPRESENT FOSSIL FUEL WORKERS. ARE OPPOSED TO THIS IS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO DRILL AND TO BURN FOSSIL FUELS. AND WE KNOW AGAIN THAT. IF WE READ IF WE ARE SERIOUS IF YOU BELIEVE THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE CANNOT CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL. AND SOMETIMES. YOU KNOW AS LEADERS. WE HAVE TO TELL OUR FRIENDS. THAT WE NEED TO DO THE RIGHT THING. TODAY TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE TO SAVE THE PLANET I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. CARCLUB THE ROLE. MEMBERS WHAT IS THAT ABOUT ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE THAT IS OUT OF OUT. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. WELL CLOSER ALL TIED TO VOTE. HIGHS FORTY ONE KNOWS TWENTY ONE. THAT MEASURE PASSES.

FOR THIS AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE SEEING AND HEARING NINE. RECONSIDERATION IS GRANTED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THE MEASURES NOW BEFORE THE BODY YOU MAY TAKE IT UP THE CLERK. WILL READ. SOME PEOPLE THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND OTHERS IN EQUITY THE SOLID WASTE. MS FRIEDMAN MAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND- OF THIS IS A BILL THAT DEALS WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF THE MATERIAL THAT'S USED IN PACKAGING NAMELY BUBBLE WRAP EXPANDABLE MAILERS AND POLY STYRENE. NOW WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO INDUSTRY ABOUT THIS BILL FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND SINCE YESTERDAY WE'VE AGREED TO TAKE A MEMONS FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT GROUPS INCLUDING OF LIFE SCIENCES AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WE'VE ACCEPTED THEIR LANGUAGE AND THEY REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION FROM THIS BILL. WE'VE AGREED TO EXEMPT ALL RAW FOOD PRODUCTS THAT ARE SHIPPED TO EXEMPTS ANY TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE BILL IS NOT GOING TO AFFECT PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED TO SHIP FOOD TO KEEP FOOD SAFE TO KEEP FOOD FRESH OR FROZEN ITEMS FOR FOOD. BELIEVE ME MEMBERS I AM ANTI FOOD POISONING THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT IS FOR PEOPLE'S ITEMS TO COME SPOILED. WE DON'T WANT ITEMS TO A ROAD RIDE BROKEN WHEN INDUSTRY COMES TO US WITH CONCERNS WE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN WILLING TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS AND ADDRESS THEM AND I PROMISE YOU. THAT SHOULD THIS BILL GET OUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE THIS IS DOABLE MEMBERS THIS BILL IS ABOUT BRINGING INDUSTRY TO THE TABLE THIS IS ABOUT BEING SUSTAINABLE AND PUSHING NOT JUST. UNTIL COMPANIES ARE ALREADY DOING THIS ON THEIR OWN IN WHICH THERE ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL. TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED INTO CALIFORNIA FROM CHINA FROM OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD THAT THEY MEET THE SAME STANDARDS THAT SO MANY OF OUR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES ARE TAKING UPON THEMSELVES. THIS IS THE LOW HANGING FRUIT. THE LAST THING THAT I WILL SAY BESIDES GIVING YOU MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN GOOD FAITH IS I HAVE BEEN DOING. ITS TO REMIND YOU THAT WHEN THIS MATERIAL COMES INTO OUR COMMUNITIES IT GOES TO LANDFILLS WHERE IT IS NOT RECYCLABLE WHERE CAUSES PROBLEMS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WE'RE ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN ALL OF YOUR REPAIRS. ARE HAVING TO PAY A 100% OF THE COST OF THIS MATERIAL. SO THIS MATERIAL COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES IS NOT. FREE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A REPLACEMENTS THAT TODAY. ARE THAT ARE ARE THE MARKET. THIS IS JUST THE TO THE- THAT THE INTO ME. AND WHAT THAT AND REMEMBER ALSO. THAT AFTER THIS BILL GET TO THE SENATE YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER BUT THE APPLE WHEN IT COMES BACK ON CONCURRENCE. I YOU TO ALLOW US TO CAN. THIS AND CONVERSE. BY VOTING I ON THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AS FRIEDMAN RESTRICT UBER HERE RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- WHEN IT COMES UP FROM THE RECYCLING. THERE'S WILL THERE'S A WAY- I'VE DART CONTAINER CORPORATION MY DISTRICT. THERE'S ONE DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT STYROFOAM. THIS RECYCLE STYROFOAM. NAVISTAR PHONE DISPOSAL SITE MY ACTUALLY MY CITY. WERE RESIDENTS CAN DISPOSE OF STYROFOAM. PRESIDENTIAL PROP. WITHOUT OBJECTION OKAY THIS IS A PICTURE USED FOR RECYCLE STAR. THERE'S A CLOTHING ROD FOR REESE TIRE. HERE'S A COMB EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NO HAIR FROM RECYCLED. I WISH I USE IT. WELL HAVE BASEBALL TRIM RULER AND LYFT ISN'T PROP. AT THE BE RISK BUT TO IS THERE IF WE DO THAT SO IT'S TRYING DEMONIZED THESE THING. BUT TO WORK ON IT AND IN CAL DRIVEN AWAY- JOBS IN ST. BUT COME BACK AND DO THIS HAS BEEN DONE AND CAL RIGHT NOW ONE DO IT ON A MUST WHOLE LET SO I UNDERSTAND THE- AUTHORS CAN POINTS. THERE ARE WAYS TO SOME PRODUCTS IF CALIFORNIA MUST'VE WE MADE SO MUCH SO WHY NOT THIS IS THE PER EXAMPLE LIKE TOWARD YOU WANNA COME ON A TOUR IS DONE LOOK LIKE L. EVEN IF CLIP. IT'S FROM RECYCLE STAR SO THERE A USED THIS. DR COURT. YOUR RECOGNIZED. YES A CO AUTHOR AND OF AB THIRTY NINETY THIRTEEN SEVEN ONE I WILL POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE RECYCLABLE THAT CAN'T BE RECYCLED. THAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW YOU ALL KNOW THESE CLAM SHELLS THE FOOD COME IN. YOU KNOW I USED THEM TO BUT IF YOU TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO SAID IT IN THE ACTUAL BUSINESS WHAT THEY WILL TELL YOU IS YEAH THE RECYCLABLE BUT THEY'RE NOT. AND THE REASON IS ECONOMICS IN ORDER TO RECYCLE A CLAM SHELL YOU HAVE TO GET THAT PLASTIC AT LEAST ONE CONTAINERFUL. EVEN THEN YOU DON'T GET THAT MUCH MONEY FOR IT SO IT'S BETTER IF YOU HAVE TO. NOBODY EXCEPT IN THE VERY LARGEST CITIES IS ABLE TO GET A CONTAINER FULL OF THOSE. MAYBE IN NEW YORK CITY. CERTAINLY NOT IN THE- IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. YOU CAN'T RECYCLE EVERYTHING THAT'S RECYCLABLE IT DOESN'T WORK. PLASTICS ARE VERY HARD TO RECYCLE ECONOMICALLY. NOT A QUESTION OF WHAT'S PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE IT'S QUESTION THE ECONOMICS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THAT ECONOMIC BARRIER WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF PLASTICS THAT ARE GOING TO GO. BE USED FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THEN B. AND- A TRASHY FOR THE NEXT COUPLE THOUSAND YEARS THANK YOU PLEASE VOTE AYE ON THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE. I SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. THIS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH I'LL ACCEPT THAT IS MY CLOTHES AND MY WITH MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO MAKE THIS WORKABLE FOR EVERYBODY. CARCLUB RURAL. WELL THE DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A- THE SENATE IS ALREADY GONE HOME. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. MS FRIEDMAN. WHAT'S YOUR PLEASURE. THIS FRIEDMAN WAS A CALL. MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A FILE ITEM FORTY SEVEN. AB THREE THREE THREE. KAMLAGER BILL PRESENTED BY MISTER GRAY MERCURY. ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THIRD THREE BY FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER KAMLAGER AN ACCOLADE IN THE CRIMINAL GAINES. MISTER GRAY YOU MAY OPEN MEMBERS. THE SERGEANTS AND MR THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. AS WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED AB THREE THREE THREE ON THIS FLOOR I'M GOING TO LIMIT MY COMMENTS TO DESCRIBE THE CHANGES SINCE THE LAST TIME THE BILL WAS UP FOR A VOTE RECENT AMENDMENTS REFLECT GOOD FAITH CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. THE ASSOCIATION REMAINS IN OPPOSITION HOWEVER WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL AMENDMENTS THE BILL IMPRINT REMOVES PREVIOUS LANGUAGE WHICH REQUIRE THE PROSECUTION PROVE THAT THE GANG OFFENSES BENEFITED SOMEONE OF THE GANG OTHER THAN THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE OFFENSES. THE CURRENT BILL ALSO REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE PROSECUTION PROVE THE ALLEGED GANG HASN'T ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY AND ALSO ELIMINATES ALL OF THE SECTION J. WHICH INCLUDES REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE PROSECUTION PROVE THE PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED PREVIOUS OFFENSES WHERE MEMBERS OF A CRIMINAL STREET GANG AT THE TIME THOSE. OFFENSES WERE COMMITTED. AS I SAID EVEN WITH THESE AMENDMENTS DISAGREEMENTS CONTINUE TO EXIST WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. THIS IS A COMPLICATED BILL BECAUSE GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE COMPLICATED CHARGE AND MORE WORK REMAINS AS THIS BILL MOVES TO THE SENATE. WHEN I ASKED HIM THE AUTHOR- WELL THE BILL IS STILL IN THE FAMILY WAS A COMMITMENT TO KEEP GOOD FAITH OPEN MINDED NEGOTIATIONS GOING WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY SHE HAS MADE THAT COMMITMENT. AND DELIVERED ON THAT COMMITMENT WITH THIS MOST RECENT EVENTS- RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE- IN CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISS GRAY. DR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I ONCE AGAIN I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE THREE THREE. MEMBERS THIS IS A COMMON SENSE BILL THE WAY THIS AREA OF LAW CURRENTLY OPERATES ERODES THE INTEGRITY OF OUR COURT SYSTEM. WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING JUDGES AND PROSECUTION TO DO THEIR JOBS. ONCE AGAIN TO BE CLEAR THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE STILL ON THE HOOK FOR THEIR UNDERLYING OFFENSE. NO ONE IS GIVEN A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE PASS. BUT IT DOES REQUIRE STANDARDS TO BE PLACE TO PROVE THAT SOMEONE WHO IS ACCUSED OF A CRIME IS AFFILIATED WITH A GANG. HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE THAT WERE USED IN THE PAST TO PROVE SOMEONE WAS IN A GANG. A MICKEY MOUSE PEN. ATTENDING A SINGLE TAMAYO CELEBRATION. WEARING A SPORTS LOGO. A SPORTS TEAM LOGO. WEARING A RED A PRINT TO WORK. ATTENDING A FUNERAL AND LIVING IN A PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT THESE GANG ENHANCEMENTS DETER SOMEONE FROM JOINING A GANG NOR THAT THEY MAKE THE COMMUNITY SAFER. THERE IS HOWEVER VERY STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THESE GANG ENHANCEMENTS HAVE BEEN USED AS A ANOTHER TOOL TO DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY IMPACT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL AIMS TO HELP MAKE THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM MORE FAIR JUST AND HUMANE. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED THE AUTHOR HAS WORKED ON THIS BILL AND HAS ADDED AMENDMENTS AND HAS PLACE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIS BILL IF IT'S IF IT REACHES THE SENATE. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB THREE THREE THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER MISTER BRYANT. YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THREE THREE THREE AS WELL. WE HAVE GANG INJUNCTIONS THAT CRIMINALIZE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS. WITH THE GANG DATABASE WHICH THE LAPD AND OTHERS HAVE ADMITTED TO FALSELY CLASSIFYING FOLKS IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THAT DATABASE AND THEN WE SLAP GANG ENHANCEMENTS ON IT. AND THE JUDICIARY TO EXACERBATE SENTENCES THAT COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OUR STATE CORRECTIONS EXPENDITURES JUST THIS YEAR R. THIRTEEN PLUS BILLION DOLLARS. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO TAKE CARE OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO BRING FOLKS HOME TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY. THESE GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE NOT GOING AWAY WITH THIS BILL. WHICH IS STANDING TO ME. SIMILAR TO OTHER BILLS WE TALK ABOUT THE LAST FEW DAYS IT JUST RAISES THE STANDARD NEEDED TO PROVE THAT A PERSON BELONGING AGAIN. THAT THE ACT WAS COMMITTED ON BEHALF OF THE GAME. IT IS COMPLETE REASONABLE APPROPRIATE AND RESPONSIBLE TO RAISE THAT STANDARD. AND A STATE WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN THE LARGEST JAIL SYSTEM ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. I BELIEVE IN THIS BODY I STAND STRONG IN SUPPORT I'M ASKING FOR YOUR I. VOTERS WITH. THIS BOERNER HORVATH YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MEMBERS I'VE SPENT ABOUT THIRTY HOURS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS BILL I AM NOT NEITHER A PUBLIC DEFENDER NOR PROSECUTOR- BUT I AM A MEMBER OF THIS BODY AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHAT I LEARNED FROM THOSE THIRTY HOURS OF LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU AND THAT IS IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD EXTRA YEARS ON TO A SENTENCE IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT THERE IS A CLEAR DEFINITION THAT IS USED CONSISTENTLY AROUND THE STATE. AND THERE'S DUE PROCESS I KNOW IN THE OPPOSITION THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT THIS A MEMBER OF SOMEBODY WAS A MEMBER OF THE GANG THEY'RE NOW LITERALLY DEBATING THREE DIFFERENT WORDS I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT THOSE THREE WORDS WILL BE WORKED OUT IN THE SENATE I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO AS A BODY AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE AND LET'S CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THIS BILL SHOULD NOT THAT A DATE LET'S MOVE IT TO THE SENATE I. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. MISTER. THANK YOU I AM. I TOTALLY RESPECT- V. MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS BILL HI. I JUST THAT THERE TO MANY BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE. ON THE RECEIVING END OF THESE GANG ENHANCEMENTS. AND I KNOW THAT. THEY SHOULD NOT BE USE THESE ENHANCEMENTS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO UNFAIRLY. CALL AFTER. PICULET COMMUNITIES I JUST WANT TO SHARE AS- A FORMER LOS ANGELES CUNTY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND AS A FORMER LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER. ONE OF MY EARLIEST EXPERIENCES. AS A PROSECUTOR. I WAS PROSECUTING. A. FELONY CHARGE FOR ROBBERY. AGAINST AN ALLEGED GANG MEMBER. IT WAS A PRETTY SAID IN A RUN OF THE MILL ROBBERY. WHERE. I BELIEVE IS A GROCERY STORE AND A- PYJAMA LATINO NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I ASKED THE STORE CLERK WHO WAS THE TO THE LEAD WITNESS. IN THE CASE. WHEN I WAS. TALKING WITH THEM BEFORE I PRESENTED THE CASE. IS THAT THE GUY THAT'S SITTING IN THE COURTROOM. THE THAT'S HIM. YOU READY TO TESTIFY NO I CAN'T TESTIFY. I CAN'T TESTIFY BECAUSE I'M TOO AFRAID. BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK THAT'S MY JOB THAT'S MY STORE I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT STORE I KEEP THAT'S MY COMMUNITY. AND IF I TESTIFY. THEY'RE GOING TO COME AND GET ME. AND SO THAT HIGHLIGHTS. WHAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION IS HIGHLIGHTING IN THEIR LETTER OF OPPOSITION. THAT FEAR AND INTIMIDATION OF THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY WHERE THEY GANG OPERATES TENDS TO BE THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION BEHIND ALL GANG RELATED CRIMES. AGAIN JUST AS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MASS INCARCERATION OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THE VICTIMS OF MANY OF THESE GANG CRIMES ARE THE SAME BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES. I JUST ASK. THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO DEBATE THESE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM BILLS THANK YOU NOT JUST THINK ABOUT. THOSE THAT ARE BEING CHARGED BUT ALSO THOSE THAT LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THOSE THAT ARE VICTIMS OF THESE CRIMES. MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND- FIRST OF ALL TO THE COMMENTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM TORRANCE- THE SCENARIO YOU LAID OUT UNDER AB THREE THREE THREE WOULD BE ABLE TO THE CHARGES AGAIN WITH THE GANG ENHANCEMENT. SO LET'S BE VERY CLEAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FEAR THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY JIM AT THAT THERE ARE FOLKS IN NEIGHBORHOODS- BUT IF YOU'RE- GLOBAL FEAR CRIME. AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE LEGISLATING WITH FEAR. WE SHOULD BE LEGISLATING BASED ON FACT AND THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO WORKING ON RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUES IS IMPORTANT THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THAT COMMITMENT. A STAGGERING 92% OF PEOPLE RECEIVING ANNOUNCEMENTS A 95% OF THOSE IN THE CALGARY DATABASE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR I REQUEST PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR LEVIN YEARS HAD MANY CLIENTS THAT WERE PUT INTO THE GAME DATABASE BECAUSE OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. WITH A SCHOOL WITH WHAT THEY WERE WEARING. AND ONCE THEY'RE IN THE GANG DATABASE THAT FOREVER CHANGED THEIR LIVES AND LET ME TELL YOU THERE ARE CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE. YOU'RE GONNA FIND FOLKS THAT. OUR SUBJECT IS GOING DATABASE MORE FAR MORE THAN OTHERS. AND THE REALITY IS THAT THIS AGAIN IS BASED UPON STUDY THE COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE WHICH IS MADE UP OF FORMER JUDGES ACADEMICS LEGISLATORS. ARE BEFORE MAKING THE RECOMMENDATIONS THEY HELD HEARINGS AND SOLICITED FEEDBACK FROM PROSECUTORS POLICE JUDGES VICTIMS VICTIMS FAMILY MEMBERS AND ADVOCATES AS WELL AS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND IMPACTED PEOPLE AND SCHOLARS AND THEY RECOMMENDED A GANG AND HAS A SHOULD BE LIMITED. TO ONLY THE MOST CORNER CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AB THREE THREE THREE IMPLEMENT THAT RECOMMENDATION BY DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CRIMES ARE COORDINATED COMPARED TO CRIMES ARE NOT COORDINATED. A NOTICE OF NOTABLY DOESN'T EVEN GO AS FAR AS THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED. WHY SOME CLAIMS AS THE MAKES AN FOR AND DISCONTENT PROSTITUTING AND HUSBANDS IS SIMPLY JUST NOT TRUE. AB THREE THREE THREE ASSEMBLY REDEFINES HOW THE PROSECUTION PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE ALLEGED CRIMINAL STREET GANG THE REQUIRES THAT GANG CHARGES BE PRESENTED IN SEPARATE PROCEEDINGS TO AVOID BIAS. WELL MANY CRIMINAL JUSTICE EXPERTS DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD DO AWAY WITH GETTING HOUSES COMPLETELY THIS IS NOT WHAT A. B. THREE THREE THREE DOES- AB THREE THREE THREE ALSO DOES NOT PREVENT DISCOLORATION PROSECUTE VIOLATIONS LAW WHATSOEVER AND DOES NOT LIMIT THE KINDS OF CRIMES AGAIN HAS TO BE ADDED TO. THAT AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT. ONLY ABOUT FEAR LOOK LOOK WE HAVE CREATED THE- WE'VE CREATED THE ISSUE OF MASS INCARCERATION. IN OUR STATE BASED MOSTLY ON FEAR AND FEAR BASED ARGUMENTS NOT FACT BASED ARGUMENTS THIS STILL ALLOWS US TO GO OUT TO THOSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY COMMITTING. CONDUCT THAT FALLS IN THE CATEGORY OF GANG CONDUCT THAT SHOULD HAVE DURING AN HAS. BUT NOT JUST THROWING ABROAD NOT OVER ENTIRE COMMUNITY. BASED UPON FEAR BUT THAT ASPECT YEAH FOR YOUR VOTE. MISTER COOPER YOUR BROADCAST THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I DON'T I HEARD COLLEAGUE FROM TORRANCE TALKING ABOUT VICTIMS THE DA I DON'T HER OTHER FOLKS TALKING ABOUT VICTOR. I SPENT THIRTY YEARS AS A COP IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS AND IN OUR CAR. OF THE GETTING THE GET SARJU I COMMITTED UNIT FLOOD F. GAME IN AND PUT GAMERS IN THE DATABASE. THE HURLEY SOME OF A FEW FOR.

WE'VE DONE SO MUCH AND WE GOT SAID IT JUST FOR VICTIMS WHO INNOVATIVE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HERE BECAUSE IF FAIL SOME OF THE INDUSTRY UP THERE'S BEEN SOME IF YOU TALK TO THEIR MOTHER SISTER. ON A REGULAR I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE SO IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE TO SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT IT IN THE OFFENSE WHEN LOOKING HAVEN'T SEEN IT. AND DEALT WITH IT ON A DAILY BASIS- PEOPLE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD THEY LIVE THERE THEY DON'T SPEAK UP AND WANNA GET SHOT BECAUSE GAINES RUN IS NOT OVER CRIME IS NOT THIS A- OKAY THEY'RE THEY'RE- AND SO THESE FOLKS ARE VERY RUTHLESS AND YOU THE GAME HAS BEEN ON ABSOLUTELY HER PERCENT.

MR VOEPEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES. WE'RE GETTING TOWARDS THE END OF SERGEANTS ARE B. AS BRIEF AS I CAN. BUT WE PASSED BILL AFTER BILL AFTER BILL AFTER BILL RESTRICTING POLICE OFFICERS. SOFTENING UP THE WHOLE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WE'VE GOT LAYER UPON LAYER THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST THREE DAYS TWO DAYS. AND I'D LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE. THAT THIS BILL WILL CUT SLACK. NOT JUST FOR THE GANGS OF COLOR. BUT I REMIND YOU AND I'VE. CROSTON WHEN I WAS THE MAYOR OF MY CITY THERE ARE. FUNDAMENTALLY CAUCASIAN BIKER GANGS THERE ARE VIETNAMESE GANGS THERE ARE. ALL SORTS OF GAMES OUT THERE AND THIS WILL GIVE THEM ADVANTAGES. AND THE INTIMIDATION FACTOR IS A REAL. AND IF YOU CROSS SOME. THEY WILL COME AFTER YOU. SO KEEP THAT IN MIND THANK YOU. YEAH THANKS FOR VOEPEL MISTER K. HAND YOU RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I HAVE TO JUST BE HONEST I THOUGHT THERE COMMITTEE AT THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. I THOUGHT THROUGH THE- WITNESS IN OPPOSITION TO NICE TO BE TODAY NO OF THIS IS HARD TO LISTEN TO THIS ONE SAY THAT. I HAVE. INDIVIDUALS ARE CHOI WITH. RELATED GANGS. AND I JUST WANT TO TALK WITH HUMANITY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS FOR ONE SECOND BECAUSE THEIR PEOPLE. AND THEIR PEOPLE WHO DONE YOU'VE MADE MISTAKES HAVE DONE HORRIBLE THINGS AT TIMES. BUT THERE PEOPLE IN THE FUNDS. NATURE OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR USE JUSTICE LOOSELY THERE THEY DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S MUCH JUSTICE IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. IS THAT WE DO NOT TAKE SOMEONE'S FREEDOM AWAY FROM THEM. AND LESS. THE PROSECUTOR HAS PROVEN. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT THAT PERSON COMMITTED THE CRIME. WE DEMAND UNANIMITY IN A JURY WE DEMAND THAT THE- PROSECUTOR DO HIS OR HER JOB. BEFORE WE TAKE SOMEONE'S FREEDOM. BEFORE WE TAKE THEM AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR JOB AND THEIR LIFE. BECAUSE YES. THEY'RE CALLING FROM SACRAMENTO SAID VICTIMS DESERVE. JUSTICE ANOTHER COLLEAGUE SAN DIEGO SAID THE UNDERLYING CRIME HERE WILL BE SERVED IN EFFECT IN MANY CASES THERE MIGHT BE A GUN ENHANCEMENT AS WELL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE ABOUT A HALF AN AWAY. BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE TAKING YEARS. WILL BE CLEAR YEARS AWAY FROM INDIVIDUALS AND LESS THE PROSECUTOR HAS DONE JOB THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF OUR SYSTEM AND ALL THAT THIS BILL ASKS FOR PROSECUTORS TO DO IS DO THEIR JOB AND IF THEY DO IT. IN THE GARDEN HAS BEEN WILL BE PLACED IN THE INDIVIDUAL SERVER DIFFERENT ADDITIONAL TIME. BUT IF THEY CAN'T DO THEIR JOB WE WILL NOT DENY THEM FREEDOM FOR ADDITIONAL YEARS. SO MEMBERS I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF JUSTICE DEMANDS OF US. SO YES THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF FEAR. AND WHEN MORE THAN 90% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING THIS PLACE ON THE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR WE NEED TO ASK YOURSELF IF WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS JUST IN HIS RIGHT AND THE ANSWER TO ME IS CLEARLY NO. AND SO I ASKED HER AYE VOTE TODAY BECAUSE IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO LOOK AT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT MORE JUST FOR THOSE WHO ARE PLACED INTO IT. AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF. IS THE FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT SHOULD MAKE IT JUST AND THAT IS ALL THIS BILL DOES IS DEMAND WHAT IS ALREADY PLACED IN OUR SYSTEM RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANKS FOR KI&lt;c.cyan&gt; SEEING NO&lt;/c&gt; ADDITIONAL. DEBATE ON THE MATTER. MISTER GRAY YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THANK YOU COLLEAGUES FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE SPOKEN THIS AFTER IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND- AND TO THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE SPOKEN OPPOSITION INCLUDING MY COLLEAGUE AND GOOD FRIEND FROM ELK GROVE. SOME MEMBERS MIGHT SAID APPEARED. COUNTY YOUR ARGUMENTS I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT BECAUSE YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE SOUND. ISSUES RAISED BY MY COLLEGE MORE GROVE ARE ACCURATE. AT THE SAME TIME WE DO HAVE INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. IN THIS CASE WE HAVE AN AUTHOR WHO IS WORKING IN GOOD FAITH WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY WE HAVE A MEMBER ACTING AS A FOR JACKIE HERE WHO HAS A STRONGER PRO LAW ENFORCEMENT RECORD THAT PROBABLY MOST THE FOLKS ON THIS FLOOR. WE HAVE TO DO THE WORK IT'S HARD WORK AND WE'VE TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS HERE IN THIS HOUSE. I'M IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR TO TAKE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS. IN THE SENATE AND I HOPE WE BRING A BILL BACK ON CONCURRENCE. THAT HAS NO OPPOSITION. THAT WE DO THE WORK. TO BUILD CONSENSUS SOMETIMES THE UNBRIDLED ARROGANCE OF THE MAJORITY OF WHICH I'M A PART OF. RUNS RIGHT OVER PEOPLE ON BILLS THAT'S NOT HOW I DO BUSINESS IT'S NOT HOW I'M GONNA DO BUSINESS WITH- THE GOOD SENATOR ON THIS BILL- WE'RE GOING TO DO THE WORK AND HOPEFULLY. WE'LL COME BACK WITH THE PRODUCT IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THE ONE YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE ON TODAY AND I ASKED RESPECTFULLY MEMBERS. GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WORK RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. AND WITH THAT THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. MEMBERS VOTE. THE DESIRE TO VOTE ON MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE DESIRE TO VOTE. OKAY. ALL MEMBERS OF THE SERVER. MR PRAYER. THIS WEEK I THINK WE HAVE- SEVERAL MEMBERS ALL FOR TOMORROW IT WILL MOVE THE CALL AND- RETURNED WITH THE FULL VOTES HERE MOMENTARILY MISTER GRAY MOST OF CALL. I AM PREPARED TO LIFT THE CALL ON MR GRAY'S ITEM CARPOOL POSTS. AB THREE THREE THREE ALL MEMBERS WHO WISH TO VOTE. CLERK WILL. CLOSER ALL TIED UP AS FORTY ONE KNOWS TWENTY SIX THE MEASURE PASSES. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO TAKE A MIS CORREOS ITEM. THIS IS FILE ITEM. TWENTY ONE. AB. NINE THIRTY SEVEN. QUACKERY ASSEMBLY GO NINE THIRTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO AND OTHER PERSON ACCORDING TO ENFORCEMENT MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I AM SO PROUD AND HONORED 2% ASSEMBLY BILL NINE THREE SEVEN THE VISION ACT. WHICH WOULD PROTECT REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE FROM BEING FUNNELED INTO IMMIGRATION DETENTION BY CALIFORNIA LOCAL JAILS AND PRISONS. THERE CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR TIME EARNED PAROLE OR HAVE HAD THEIR SENTENCES COMMUTED BY GOVERNOR BY A GOVERNOR AFTER A CLOSE REVIEW OF THEIR CLEMENCY APPLICATION. ONE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CAL AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ASSIST WHICH TRANSFERS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO ICE THEY IGNORE THE RECORD OF REHABILITATION STABLE RE ENTRY PLANS. AND THEIR NETWORK OF COMMUNITY AND FAMILY SUPPORT. MANY CALIFORNIA COUNTIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES SANTA CLARA SAN FRANCISCO HUMBOLDT SAN JOAQUIN SANTA CRUZ CONTRA COSTA HAVE ALREADY RECOGNIZE THIS AND HAVE ENDED I AND HAVE ENDED TRANSFERS TO ICE. MEMBERS IF NOT FOR WHERE THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE BORN THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. AB NINE THREE SEVEN WILL MOVE OUR STATE CLOSER TO FULFILLING ITS COMMITMENT TO IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMING BLACK LATINO INDIGENOUS AND AAPI COMMUNITIES IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT AND WILLINGNESS TO REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND END MASS INCARCERATION. HOWEVER FOR IN WHO HAVE EARNED RELEASE. THIS JUST MEANS THEY'RE GOING TO BE HANDED OVER TO ICE AND FACE PERMANENT SEPARATION FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES. LET ME BE CLEAR. CALIFORNIA IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ASSIST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH DEPORTATIONS THIS BILL ALSO DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM RESPONDING TO A CRIMINAL WARRANT OR PARTICIPATING IN JOINT TASK FORCES. IF THE PURPOSE OF THAT TASK FORCE IT'S CRIMINAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. MANY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE AN INTER MINUTE SENTENCES MEANING THAT MEANING THAT THEIR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY AFTER GOING THROUGH THE RIGOROUS PAROLE PROCESS WHERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR CASE ON THE RECORD OF REHABILITATION ARE CLOSELY. REVIEWED ONLY ABOUT ONE IN FIVE THAT HAVE THEIR CASES REVIEWED BY THE PAROLE BOARD EARNS RELEASE. IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUT THEIR SENTENCES OR HAVE BEEN PAROLED SHOULD NOT FACE DOUBLE PUNISHMENT. THERE ARE PLENTY OF WELL DOCUMENTED EXAMPLES IN WHICH IS THE TENSION HAS SHOWN SYSTEMIC ABUSES IN HUMANE CONDITIONS AND EVEN INVOLUNTARY FORCED STERILIZATION. I WANT TO SHARE THE STORY OF PARASAILING CAL CAME TO THE UNITED STATES AS A CHILD AS A REFUGEE FROM LAOS HE WASN'T ON HOUSE TEAM LIVE IN FRESNO WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED AND INCARCERATED AT THE AGE. IN CDCR CUSTODY AND HE WAS SELECTED FOR A FIRE CAN PLACEMENT WHERE HE SPENT LONG HOURS AS AN INCARCERATED FIREFIGHTER ON THE FRONT LINES OF SOME OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THAT OUR STATE. HAS EVER SEEN. CAL EARNED HIS RELEASE FROM CDC ARE BUT HE DID NOT GET TO RETURN TO HIS FAMILY. IN FRESNO RATHER CDC ARE FACILITATED HIS TRANSFER TO ICE WHERE HE SPENT TEN MONTHS IN A DETENTION FACILITY IN LOUISIANA. DURING THE DEPTHS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. HOW RECENTLY RECEIVE A PARDON FROM GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN RECOGNITION. OF HIS RECORD OF SERVICE AND REHABILITATION. I AM THANKFUL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR USING HIS EXECUTIVE POWER TOWARDS JUSTICE. BUT PARITY BETWEEN CITIZEN. AND NONCITIZEN CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE THE NORM NOT THE EXCEPTION. THE VISION NOT COLD AND ICE TRANSFERS FROM OUR LOCAL JAILS AND CDCR. AND PRACTICE A TREATMENT. AND IT'LL END THE PRACTICE OF TREATMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY JUST SIMPLY BASED ON WHERE THEY WERE BORN. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH AND HEARD FROM SEVERAL OF OUR COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THE SPIRIT OF THIS BILL WHO HAVE SUGGESTED CARVE OUTS FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF CRIMES INCLUDING SEX CRIMES. AND OTHER OFFENSES I WANT TO SAY CLEARLY IN CLOSING HOW WE WILL ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AS THE BILL MOVES OUT OF THIS CHAMBER BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THOSE MEMBERS WHO WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT HAVE RESERVATIONS THERE. AS BILL HEADS TO THE SENATE I FULLY INTEND TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FELLOW MEMBERS AND THE AMAZING COMMUNITY COALITION THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAS PROPELLED THE LEGISLATION FORWARD TO FINE TUNE THE LANGUAGE. SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS BILL SIGNED INTO LAW THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE CAN'T LET ANOTHER YEAR GO BY WHERE THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. ARE BEING TURNED OVER TO ICE BY OUR STATE. I COMMIT TO A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO FACILITATE THAT PROCESS INCLUDING THROUGH MUTUALLY. AGREEABLE AMENDMENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISS CARILLO MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU FOR MUCH FOR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. ONE OF THINK THE OFFER FROM LOS- FOR BRINGING THERE'S A BILL BEFORE US TODAY ASSEMBLY BILL NINE THIRTY SEVEN I AM A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF HIS BILL WHICH WOULD ENSURE. NO LET ME TALK ABOUT A STORY. A STORY THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT THAT INDIVIDUAL BY NAME OF JOAQUIN. A NAVY VETERAN. WHO SERVE THIS COUNTRY NOTABLY. BUT NEARLY. ALMOST A PORTED BECAUSE OF CDCR WORKING WITH ICE. ARCHANA RYAN ARRIVED HERE THE UNITED STATES WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD. HE WAS BROUGHT HERE FROM MEXICO TO CALIFORNIA. HE SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY I BROUGHT. ON A BATTLESHIP AND WAS DEPLOYED TO IRAQ KUWAIT AFGHANISTAN AND RECEIVED SEVERAL. SEVERAL MEDALS OF VALOR. HE WAS ALSO PROMISE. CITIZENSHIP FOR LIFTING. BUT NEVER RECEIVED ANY CHANGES AND IT'S IMMIGRATION STATUS. AFTER WALKING WAS HONORABLY DISCHARGED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. HE HAD TO ACCESS HERE NO ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES TO HELP HIM DEAL WITH THE IMPACT OF HIS SERVICE. TO THIS COUNTRY. BECAUSE OF THE MENTAL. ISSUES THAT HE WAS DEALING WITH JOAQUIN DEALT WITH THE STRESS THE TRAUMA AND EXPERIENCE DURING HIS ENLISTMENT BY MEDICATING HIMSELF WITH ALCOHOL AND BECAME INCARCERATED FOR THREE YEARS. HE WAS RELEASED EARLY FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR. BY THE STATE AUTHORITIES BUT CITIES THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY HANDED HIM OVER TO ICE. IF NOT FOR THE INTERVENTION BY IMMIGRATION RIGHTS ADVOCATES JOAQUIN WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPORTED AFTER MORE YEARS. A FIGHTING HIS IMMIGRATION CASE WORKING FINALLY WON HIS CASE TO STAY WITH HIS FAMILY AND CHILDREN HERE IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. HE WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A UNITED STATES CITIZEN BECAUSE OF HIS SERVICE. WE MUST PASS THE VISION ACT SO THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS TO SUFFER THROUGH WHAT JOAQUIN EXPERIENCE. AT HONOR THE SERVICE OF OUR IMMIGRANT VETERANS MEMBERS THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR STRONG AYE VOTE OR AB NINE THIRTY SEVEN. MISTER DAVID CHIU YEAR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES I KNOW IT'S EASY TO GET LOST OFTENTIMES IN LEGAL ARCANA OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE AROUND POLICY BUT I WANT TO JOIN IN SUPPORT OF THE VISION ACTS. BY SHARING. ANOTHER HUMAN STORY ABOUT WHO THIS IMPACTS IT CONSTRUCTION OF MINE WHO WORKS AS A SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELOR AT A TREATMENT CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO A CAMBODIAN REFUGEE TE TAAN. SINCE BIRTH HIS LIFE WAS DEFINED BY VIOLENCE. AFTER HE FLED THE GENOCIDE IN CAMBODIA. SURVIVE THE GANG WARS IN FRESNO AS A CHILD. AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN A JUDGE SENTENCED HIM TO LIFE IN PRISON. FOR KILLING A RIVAL GANG MEMBER. TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER IF GREW UP I BECAME A FULL TIME CERTIFIED SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELOR HE'S HELPED INCARCERATED PEOPLE BREAK THE SAME CYCLE OF TRAUMA VIOLENCE THAT HE HAD GOTTEN CAUGHT IN. THE PAROLE BOARD FOUND THAT HE POSE NO RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AND RECOMMENDED THAT HE BE RELEASED. BUT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING HIM TO USE HIS TRAINING AND HIS EXPERIENCE TO MAKE OUR SOCIETY SAFER. CDCR CALLED ICE ON TEST RELEASE DATE. AND DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN. TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DEPORTING HIM TO A COUNTRY THAT HE FLED AS A CHILD TO A COUNTRY WHERE WE NO LONGER HAD TIES. NOW BECAUSE OF HIS UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS. HE WAS FORTUNATELY RELEASED FROM ICE CUSTODY BUT THIS STORY IS NOT UNIQUE. SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES ARE THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE DEPORTED FOR PAST CONVICTIONS THAN OTHER IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND A RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN A HUGE SPIKE IN THESE NUMBERS BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN A TWO HUNDRED AND 79% SPIKE IN THE DEPORTATION OF CAMBODIAN REFUGEES. A 58% INCREASE IN THE DEPORTATION OF VIETNAMESE AMERICAN REFUGEES. AND THIS TARGETING OF THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEE COMMUNITY HAS CONTINUED TO THIS DAY. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MARCH. THE SAME WEEK AS THE HORRIFIC ATLANTA SHOOTING AND DURING OUR PRESIDENT'S FIRST HUNDRED DAYS IN OFFICE. THERE WERE THIRTY THREE MEMBERS OF OUR VIETNAMESE REFUGEE COMMUNITY WHO WERE DEPORTED. AND I WAS- API COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE IS A VERY DISTURBING RISE IN ANTI ASIAN HATE. MANY OF US BELIEVE THAT WE NEED POLICIES TO UPLIFT OUR COMMUNITIES. TO UPLIFT INDIVIDUALS LIKE TO TAUNT. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE VISION ACT CAN HELP DO THAT I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS HOW WE REFLECT A- SOCIETY AND WITHOUT I'M PROUD TO BE PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER LEE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SIR I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB NINE THREE SEVEN THE VISION ACT BUILDING UPON WHAT MY COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT CONGRESS AND JUST GOES TALKING ABOUT ON A HIGHLAND HUMAN. OF A SOUTHEAST ASIAN ARM OF ON WHEN ON WHEN IS A VIETNAMESE REFUGEE WHO CAME TO THE UNITED STATES AS A CHILD IN NINETEEN NINETY TO BE REUNITED WITH HIS FAMILY WHO MIGRATED TO THE U. S. JUST FIVE YEARS BEFORE HIM AS A YOUTH ON FAMILY STRUGGLE THE POVERTY AND ADJUSTING TO LIFE IN A NEW COUNTRY. AND FACING ANTI ASIAN RACISM EVEN THEN AND BOWLING AS A YOUTH HE ULTIMATELY MADE A MISTAKE THAT RESULTED IN FEWER ROBBERIES ON SERVED OVER TWENTY YEARS TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON FOR THOSE ROBBERIES AND CHOSE TO TURN HIS LIFE AROUND HE PARTICIPATED MULTIPLE SELF HELP PROGRAMS TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACTIONS WORKED MULTIPLE JOBS. AND ENROLLED IN JOB SKILLS TRAINING. AND THEN IN OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN. I COMPLETED HIS. HOW AND OF BEING. TO IS FOR. ON WAS TRY. TO ICE CUSTODY DEEP. PROCEEDINGS SO ON HAS BEEN RELEASED TODAY HE STILL FACES THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING DEPORTED TO THE COUNTRY HE LEFT AS A CHILD. AND MEMBERS I THINK ABOUT HOW. UTTERLY INHUMANE AND CRUEL IS. AFTER SERVING YOUR TIME IN PRISON DECADES OF YOUR LIFE FOR A MISTAKE THAT YOU MADE AND TO TURN YOUR LIFE AROUND TO BE SENT BACK TO A COUNTRY. WHERE YOU HAVE NO TIES ANYMORE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF MILES ACROSS THE PACIFIC AND THAT IS THE REALITY FOR SO MANY ASIAN AMERICANS. THAT COULD BE FACING DEPORTATION THAT ARE STILL RIGHT NOW. FACING POTENTIALLY OF MEDIEVAL KIND OF PUNISHMENT OF EXILE I THINK ABOUT THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF. RISING ANTI ASIAN SENTIMENT AND I'LL DO YOU ALTHOUGH THE COMP THE MOST COMMON REFRAIN AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS THIS. IS GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY. THIS WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS SEEKING TO NSA COMPLICITY OF RECORD OF UPHOLDING THAT STEREOTYPE LITERALLY SENDING US BACK TO A THE COUNTRY WERE BORN IN PERHAPS JUST LIKE IN NEW IN CASE BUT WE HAVE NO MORE TIES HERE WE ARE AMERICAN OR ASIAN AMERICANS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO END THE STATE SPONSORED DEPORTATIONS ENDING THE SENDING PEOPLE BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM STEREOTYPE. THE VISION X. SUPPORTS THE ASIAN A ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMITTEE MEMBERS IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION DEPORTATION WHO ARE OFTEN THEMSELVES VICTIMS OF ANTI ASIAN VIOLENCE AS YOU UP YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ADVOCACY TO STOP ASIAN HATE MUST INCLUDE PEOPLE LIKE ON THE TALK ABOUT THE VISION AS A CORE BILL THIS THE CYCLE VIOLENCE AND HATE ON EMMERICH INCLUDING PLEASE ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW SO I ASK FOR YOUR ITEM. THANK YOU MISTER LEE. MISTER SANTIAGO YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU S. ARRIVED SUPPORT OF THE ACT AND THAT ALL MY COLLEAGUES WE WOULD DO SAME AND OF SUPPORTING A AND I'M NOT SURE SO ABOUT ONE ARKANSAS- MUNOZ IS ONE OF OUR TO STAY. I WHO NOW AS A SO TO ARE.

AND ALL THESE IDENTITY GROUP CLOSE WERE DOING TO ME VET. HEY CARLOS WAS ABLE TO LEAVE HAS NOW A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY. BY THE TIME THAT HE WAS LEAVING. HE WAS HELD A BLANKS. HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO BE BACK THE- AND WAS ABLE TO STAY. BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH MANY PEOPLE. AND HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. HEY. FAIRNESS THE FAIRNESS A AND IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE QUALITY YOU BELIEVE IT INEQUALITY FOR ALL. AND WE'RE NOT SAYING GIVE ANYBODY A GET AWAY JAIL FREE CARD WE'RE NOT SAYING. IN THIS BILL REDUCE A SENTENCE NOT SAYING IN THIS BILL. A PERSON HE SHOULD BE SENTENCED FOR THE CRIME THEY DID WHAT WE ARE SAYING NOW IS VERY CLEAR. THAT PERSON HAS SERVED THEIR TIME. THAT PERSON HAS UNDERGONE REHABILITATION. AND IF WE'RE REALLY GONNA VALUE IMMIGRANTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REALLY GOING TO SAY THAT THAT THEY'RE EQUAL AND WE FOUGHT IN. GOD KNOWS LOTS OF LEGISLATION COMES OUT OF THIS BUILDING IS AIMED. AT AT EQUALITY. LOTS MORE WORK TO DO BUT THAT'S WHAT THE AIM IS. THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME EQUALITY FOR IMMIGRANTS AS WELL. IF THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME. THEN WHEN THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME. THEY SHOULD NOT BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN ANYONE ELSE. THAT'S A SIMPLE. PROMISE OF THIS BILL TREAT THEM LIKE YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE. I RESPECT LAST NIGHT OF. I THANK MR SANTIAGO SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE MISCREANT YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND TO THE MEMBERS THAT- SPOKE IN SUPPORT AND I RECOGNIZE THE TIME AND FOR THOSE THAT PUT THE MICROPHONE DOWN AND HAD ADDITIONAL STORIES TO SHARE AS WELL. WE ALL KNOW AS A GREAT DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID. THE ARC OF MORAL. THE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE IS LONG BUT IT BENDS TOWARDS JUSTICE REPRESENTATION MATTERS AND WE THIS BODY MUST ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME WILL BE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND HAVE A SECOND CHANCE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE TRADITIONALLY DISCRETION SENTENCING THE POWER THE PAROLE BOARD OR THE OR IMMIGRATION CUSTOMS AND ENFORCEMENT FROM DOING THEIR JOB. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE JOINT AUTHORS AND THE CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL THE LATINO AND A. P. I.
