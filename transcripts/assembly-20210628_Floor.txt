MEMBERS WEIRD BUSINESS ON THE DAILY FILE WE HAVE. AMENDMENTS MR CHIU HAS AMENDMENTS. ON AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO. THIS IS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE THE A MAN'S ON EIGHT. THIRTY TWO. THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT THIRTY TWO WITH AMENDMENTS BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU MISTER CHILL ON THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES COLLEAGUES AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO ADDRESSES AN ADDICTION CRISIS THAT LOOMS OF CURRENT PROTECTIONS ARE NOT EXTENDED BEYOND JUNE THIRTIETH WHICH IS THIS WEDNESDAY. DESPITE VACCINATIONS AND THE ECONOMY RE OPENING MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL IN PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL SITUATIONS. TENANTS MANY STRUGGLING WITH SKYROCKETING RENTS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT OF UNPRECEDENTED JOB LOSSES DURING THE LAST FIFTEEN MONTHS. THEY'VE TAKEN ON A DEBT AND MANY ARE STILL HANGING ON BY A THREAD. THIS PAST MONTH ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSEHOLDS REPORTED TO THE CENSUS SLIGHT OR NO CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THE NEXT MONTH'S RENT. A RECENT POLICY LIKE ANALYSIS ESTIMATES NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON RENT. AND AT THE SAME TIME AS MANY OF US KNOW. OUR STATE HAS RECEIVED A RECORD FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS BUT ONLY A SMALL FRACTION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN RECEIVED BY STRUGGLING TENANTS AND LANDLORDS. WITH THE AVAILABLE FUNDING ANY AFFECTION PROTECTIONS THIS WEEK WOULD BE FUMBLING ON THE ONE YARD LINE. IT WOULD BE TRAGIC TO A BIG FAMILIES ON TO THE STREETS WHEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR HOMES WITH RENT REALLY FUNDING. THE WAIVER PROTECTIONS WE COULD POTENTIALLY SEE. WOULD ALSO RESULT IN EXACERBATING HOMELESSNESS. WITH AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO WE'VE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID THAT SCENARIO TO KEEP TENANTS HOUSED AND GET LANDLORDS INCREASE FINANCIAL SUPPORT. HERE ARE SOME OF THE MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. FIRST IT EXTENDS CURRENT EVICTION PROTECTIONS FOR THREE MONTHS UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH SO ELIGIBLE TENANTS AND LANDLORDS CAN RECEIVE FUNDING. SECOND AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO. EXPANDS PAYMENT RATES FOR LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. CURRENTLY LANDLORDS REQUIRE TO FORGIVE 20% RENTAL DEBT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FOR THE REMAINING 80% OR ELSE THE TENANT ONLY RECEIVE ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENT. LANDLORDS AND TENANTS WOULD SIMPLY RECEIVE A THAT ALREADY RECEIVED RENTAL ASSISTANCE TOP UP PAYMENTS TO GET 2100% WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSED. LANDLORDS WHOSE TENANTS HAVE MOVED OUT BUT ARE STILL- RENTAL PAYMENTS CAN APPLY AS WELL. AND TENANTS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE DIRECTLY. THIRD AFTER VISION PROTECTIONS AND SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THIS BILL CREATES A SIX MONTH BACKSTOPS PROCESS DEPOSIT FICTIONS ONLY FOR THOSE TENANTS WHO NEED ADDITIONAL TIME TO ACCESS RENTAL SYSTEMS. AND FOURTH COURT RECORDS RELATED TO EVICTION FOR RENT NONPAYMENT DURING COVE IT OR THE CANCELLATION FOR THE COLLECTION OF COVERT RENTAL DEBT WILL BE PERMANENTLY SEALED TO AVOID IMPACTING A PERSON'S LONG TERM CREDIT. OR ABILITY TO APPLY FOR FUTURE HOUSING. LIKE PRIOR COVETED NINETEEN EVICTION PROTECTION BILLS. THIS BILL IS BY NO MEANS PERFECT. BUT IF WE DON'T PASS THIS BILL TODAY WE COULD SEE A WAVE OF EVICTIONS AND INCREASED HOMELESSNESS WELL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FUNDING ARE LEFT UNTAPPED. ENDING THESE PROTECTIONS NOW WOULD SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE OUR ABILITY TO HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MR CHIU MEMBERS THESE ARE THE AMENDMENTS ON EIGHT THIRTY TWO THESE ARE THE AMENDMENTS. WITHOUT OBJECTION WE MAY TAKE A VOICE VOTE ON THESE AMENDMENTS. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE AYE OPPOSED SAY NAY. THE EYES HAVE IT THE MEMBERS ARE ADOPTED THE BILLS OUT THE PRINTER BACK ON FILE. MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO THE BILLING CHIEF. THIS IS A BILL IN CHIEF WITHOUT REFERENCE THE FILE. AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO. BY MISTER Q. CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT THIRTY TWO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU AN ACT RELATING TO TENNESSEE IN TO CLEAR THE ABSENCE HERE OF SIGNIFICANTLY. MISTER CHILL IF YOU WISH APPARENTLY I'VE ALREADY MADE THE PRESENTATION OF THE BILL SO I WILL JUST DEFER TO MY PRIOR COMMENTS. THANK YOU SIR. MEMBERS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE IN DEBATE RANGER MICROPHONES NOW MISTER GIBSON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT A STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT THIRTY TWO ALTHOUGH THIS% BILL AS THE AUTHORS INDICATED IS NOT THE PERFECT VIDEO. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY. MEMBERS. EVEN THOUGH THIS BILL IS NOT A PERFECT BILL IS CERTAINLY CERTAINLY IS IN THE RIGHT IN A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW AS WE SEE IN CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE HOMELESS. AND OF NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN- THIS PANDEMIC HAS ROCKED PEOPLE TRAJECTORY. LIKE NO OTHER. LAST YEAR WE'VE SEEN MANY PEOPLE ON THE STREETS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MY CONSTITUENTS ARE SUFFERING MANY OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE I'VE SAID IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT I REPRESENT THE SIX POOREST DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. I REPRESENTS. THE SIX FOUR IS THIS A GOOD STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SECOND HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE IT FOR THE PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND CERTAINLY THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE STAYING IN THEIR HOME THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME. EXPRESSLY WHEN IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE PEOPLE NEED SHELTER PEOPLE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WANT THE GOVERNMENT THEY CAN DEPEND ON THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIVE AND THEY'RE STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE AND SO I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER WAY. OF THEM TO SHOW PEOPLE AND CALIFORNIANS THOSE WHO ARE HURTING ON GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO STAY IN THEIR HOME. IT'S THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD THEIR ABILITY TO TURN A CORNER THEIR ABILITIES THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL THEIR ABILITY TO WEATHER THIS STORM THAT'S BEFORE US. EVEN THOUGH WE OPEN UP THE STATE OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL OPEN IN CLOSE. QUARTERS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT SEE THE LIGHT THEY COULD NOT SEE ALL THE HERE'S THE RAIN AND THE STORM AND SO THIS IS IN A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AS I SAID. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE THOSE WERE IMPACTED IS TO FIFTH OF A THIRD OF A SUPPORTER OF THE PEOPLE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR ON THAT ARE SUFFERING- ON DUDA'S PANDEMIC AND WHO'S MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK OUR VOTE. ON THIS BILL I THANK YOU OFFER TO WORK EXTREMELY HARD HIM AND HIS TEAM TO GET THIS BILL BEFORE US SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHAT I BOTH UNDERSTAND THE BILL. EIGHT THIRTY TWO THANK YOU. THANK MISTER. IF YOU'RE BLOWN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO WHICH IS A CRUCIAL MEASURE TO EXTEND THE EVICTION MORATORIUM AND PROVIDE RENT RELIEF FOR THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS I WANT TO THANK. THE MEMBERS OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE STAFF AND ESPECIALLY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHO HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO BRING AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO BEFORE US. AND ENSURE THAT SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES DO NOT FACE THE ONSLAUGHT OF EVICTIONS. DURING AUGUST OF LAST YEAR I ASK THIS BODY TO SUPPORT AB THREE OH EIGHT EIGHT OUR FIRST EVICTION MORATORIUM MEASURE TO PROTECT TENANTS AFFECTED BY A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND EARLIER THIS YEAR I SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF EXTENDING THE MORATORIUM BECAUSE WE WERE ON THE CUSP AT THAT TIME OF WITNESSING CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. EVICTION CASES. AND TODAY I RISE ONCE AGAIN URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO. UNLIKE THE LAST TWO MEASURES AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO COMES BEFORE US AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE. ON OUR ROAD TO RECOVERY TODAY CLOSE 260% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE FULLY VACCINATED. OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS SLOWLY REOPENING AND OUR CHILDREN NOW BACK AT SCHOOL AFTER MONTHS OF REMOTE LEARNING. WE ARE SEEING CALIFORNIA BOUNCE BACK BUT FOR CLOSE TO A MILLION RENTERS ACROSS OUR STATE BACK TO NORMAL WILL MEAN AN EVICTION AVALANCHE IF WE DO NOT PASS AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO IN L. A. COUNTY ALONE MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MADE HOMELESS SINCE THE START OF THE OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. A RECENT UCLA STUDY ESTIMATES THAT L. A. COUNTY CURRENTLY HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASES IN THE BACKLOG. THAT IS OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE FAMILIES THAT COULD BECOME HOMELESS IF WE DO NOT EXTEND THE MORATORIUM AND PROVIDE RENTAL RELIEF AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. BELIEVES THAT IF WE DO NOTHING. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL BE ADDED TO OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. THERE ALSO HAVE BEEN MORE AND MORE REPORTS OF HOUSEHOLDS OPTING TO SELF AFFECT BECAUSE OF HARASSMENT BY LANDLORDS AND ILLEGAL LOCKOUTS MORE FAMILIES ARE CHOOSING TO LEAVE THEIR APARTMENTS TO AVOID TAKING ON THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN CRIPPLING CONSUMER DEBT TO PAY BACK THE RENT OF. THE MEMBERS YOUR SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO WILL HELP PREVENT AN EVICTION AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IT'S THAT SIMPLE AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO WILL EXTEND THE EVICTION MORATORIUM FOR THREE MONTHS TO KEEP FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES AND PROVIDE RENT ASSISTANCE TO COVER ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. OF RENTS OWED SAVING BOTH RENTERS AND SMALL LANDLORDS FROM FINANCIAL RUIN. THE MEASURE ALSO REQUIRES PARENTAL CIVIL CASES FROM COVERT BE MASKED TO PROTECT TENANTS FROM HAVING THESE CASES IMPACT THEIR CONSUMER CREDIT OR TO PREVENT THEM FROM SEEKING FUTURE HOUSING. AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO WILL PROVIDE OUR HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES WITH THE SAFETY NET SO THAT THEY TOO CAN BOUNCE BACK FROM THE PANDEMIC AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM. MISS DAVIES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A FULL OVER THERE. HI MR LACKEYS DESK MISS DAVIES. OKAY GREAT ALRIGHT FORGET IT MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE I SUPPORTED THIS EARLIER FIVE MONTH EXTENSION IN JANUARY AS EMBODIED IN SB NINETY ONE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT HELD PROMISE OF COMPROMISE TO HELP TENANTS AND COMPENSATE SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS THAT PROMISE HAS NOT BEEN KEPT. FIVE MONTHS LATER I RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF TEXAS EMAILS AND CALLS JUST TODAY I RECEIVED OVER FIFTY CALLS FROM FRUSTRATED SMALLRENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS WHO ARE PLEADING WITH ME THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE CONTROL THEIR PROPERTY AND LIVELIHOOD BACK THEN PUT THEIR FAITH IN NEVER ENDING EVICTION MORATORIUMS THE FLOW DISTRIBUTION OF RENTAL RELIEF MONEY. WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY IN THIS CHAMBER BUT WHERE IS THE EQUITY WHEN WE HAVE REPORTS INCLUDING STATEMENTS BY THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION'S ATTENDED SCANNING THE SYSTEM WHEN THEY CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE IRONY IS THAT THIS EXTENSION WOULD NOT BE% NECESSARY IF WE HAD COMPETENT LEADERSHIP ENSURING THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE'RE DISTRIBUTING. RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO TENANTS AND HOUSING PROVIDERS IN AN EXPEDITED MANNER IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NUMEROUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT QUICKLY DISTRIBUTED TO THOSE IN NEED ESPECIALLY TO THE MOM AND POP RENTAL HOUSING PROVIDERS WHO HAVE NOT SEEN ANY RENT PAYMENTS YET STILL PAY THE MORTGAGE INTEREST TAXES MAINTENANCE AND OTHER EXPENSES. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE MR MRS BAILEY FROM SACRAMENTO IN MY DISTRICT THEY HAVE A RENTER WHO OWES THEM NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BACK RENT AND HAVE TOLD THEM THEY HAVE NO. INTENTION OF COOPERATING TO PAY IT BACK. MISTER HILL- OWNS A SMALL MOM AND POP RENTA FOR AND ORANGE COUNTY NEW NOT RISKY ANY. NINE RENT RELIEF LET ALONE RENT SUBSIDY. HE HAS HAD TO ENTER MANY FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS THIS PAST YEAR BECAUSE HE HAS NO INCOME. AS OF JUNE TWENTY FOURTH THE STATE HAS SENT OUT ONLY SIXTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION SHARES. THAT IS DISTURBING LESS THAN 5% LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. WHO HAVE SO FAR APPLIED FOR ONLY HALF OF THE MONEY. HOW WOULD THIS ADDITIONAL TWO POINT SIX BILLION MATTER. FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE POINT TWO BILLION WHEN THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED MILLION COULD NOT EVEN GET OUT THE DOOR. MEMBERS I WAS WILLING TO CONTEMPLATE SUPPORTING IF REPUBLICANS WERE GIVEN A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO COME UP WITH THE CHIU COMPROMISED. AFTER WE PASSED THE BIPARTISAN RELIEF MEASURE EARLIER THIS YEAR BUT SADLY THIS BILL WAS DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS I ASKED FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISS DAVIES MR GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. GOOD AFTERNOON SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE TENANTS SO ATTENDANT RIGHTS ACT THE STATE HAD EVER SEEN IN THE FORM OF TENANT PROTECTION ACT. HOWEVER AS CRITICAL AS AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WAS WE COULD NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED THEN THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC OR THE SEVERITY OF THE ADDICTION CRISIS WE WOULD BE FACING NOW TODAY WE CONTINUE BUILDING ON THE WORK WE DID WITH AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO TO PROTECT TENANTS BY PASSING THIS EVICTION MORATORIUM. ONE IN THREE HOUSEHOLDS RENT THEIR HOMES IN MY DISTRICT IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND THAT NUMBER IS ON THE RISE WITHOUT SUPPORT MANY OF THESE RENTERS STAND ON THE PRECIPICE OF THE DICTION CONTINUED UNEMPLOYMENT AND POTENTIAL HOMELESSNESS. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS IN PARTICULAR THAT MAKE THIS BILL SO VERY IMPORTANT WE ALL NEED ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT A GOOD CREDIT SCORE IS ESSENTIAL TO SECURING A PLACE TO LIVE THANKFULLY THIS BILL PROTECTS TENANTS CREDIT BY PERMANENTLY MAKE IT MASKING COURT RECORDS RELATED TO EVICTIONS FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT DURING THE PANDEMIC AND TO ACTIONS TO RECOVER RENTAL DEBT. THIS MEANS THESE RECORDS WILL BE OFF LIMITS TO CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES THIS WILL HELP PROTECT TENANTS THEIR CREDIT AND WILL PROTECT OR HELP ENSURE THAT THEY WON'T BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN THE FUTURE FOR THE STRUGGLES THEY FACED DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHAT'S MORE BY PROVIDING LANDLORDS WITH 1100% OF THE RENTAL DEBT OWED. WE WILL NOT ONLY BE HELPING OUR SMALL LANDLORDS BUT WE WILL BE HELPING MORE TENANTS RECEIVE THE FUNDING THEY NEED TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS THE STATE WILL BE REELING WILL CONTINUE AND BE REELING FROM IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC FOR YEARS TO COME. WETHERBY FROM ECONOMIC HARDSHIP JOB LOSSES OR FOR MANY THE LOSS OF EVEN LOVED ONES. ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE TOWARDS RECOVERY IS PROTECTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE CONSTITUENTS FROM FURTHER HARDSHIP BY EVICTION. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE THE TOOLS TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AND THAT MEANS HOUSING AND STRONG CREDIT. THESE PROTECTIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR PRESERVING OUR COMMUNITIES PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND REBUILDING OUR WORKFORCES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GRAYSON. MISTER FLORIDA MEMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK PLEASE RESPECT YOUR MICROPHONES NOW MR FOR. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. BUT I DID I JUST TALK TO THEIR THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE REITERATE THAT OUT OF THIS MONEY RIGHT NOW IS ROUGHLY ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS PROGRAM. ONLY SIXTY ONE MILLION OF THAT. HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PUSHED OUT THE DOOR. AND I TALKED ABOUT THAT I THINK IS GONNA DRESS IT IN HIS CLOTHES BUT I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW. THE OVERSIGHT. HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE PUSHED OUT. IN A TIMELY MANNER SO WE CAN GET IT TO THE MEN. AND THE WOMEN AND THE FAMILIES THAT SO DESPERATELY NEED THIS MONEY SO. ARE YOU CLOSE TAKE IT IN YOUR CLOSE I'D PREVIOUSLY MUCH. THANK YOU MR FLORA MISS CORREO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT THREE TWO I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT IS SPLIT BY A HIGHWAY OR FREEWAY THE ONE TEN FREEWAY ON ONE SIDE I HAVE A VERY AFFLUENT COMMUNITY IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND ON THE OTHER SIDE I HAVE UNINCORPORATED EAST LOS ANGELES WHICH IS 20% BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN HIT THE HARDEST BY COVERT. WHEN WE PASSED THE ORIGINAL BILL TO EXTEND THE EVICTION MORATORIUM A WE WERE AT A STATE WIDE DEATH TOLL OF THIRTY THOUSAND BECAUSE OF COLD IT LET'S NOT FORGET THE REASON WHY WE ARE HERE THE REASON THAT WHY WE ARE EXTENDING THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL LIVED SURVIVED AND ARE DOING THE VERY BEST WE CAN AMID A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WORD THE IMPACT TO ESSENTIAL WORKERS. HAS BEEN REAL AND DEVASTATING TO DATE MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO COVERT NINETEEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONE WORKERS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS STUDENTS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AT THE RATE THAT THEY WERE GOING BEFORE KIDS HAVE GONE HUNGRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE LUNCHES AT SCHOOL. PARENTS ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE NATION HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH PAYING RENT. PAYING THEIR UTILITIES AND SIMPLY TRYING TO SURVIVE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO DO RIGHT BY SO MANY WHO DESERVE AND ARE DESERVING OF OUR HELP AND OUR EIGHT. AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACTUALLY THINK THE LANDLORDS WHO TOOK THE INITIAL THE INITIAL PROGRAM THAT WE HAD WHICH WAS A 20% FORGIVENESS TO RENTERS. AND LET THEM KNOW THAT WITH THIS NEW PROPOSAL CURRENTLY IN PROCESS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE 20% DIFFERENCE SO THAT THAT THEY ARE ALSO MADE WHOLE. THIS IS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN'T DO BOTH. AND I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT ALL ALONG WE CAN HELP LANDLORDS ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS ON HOW TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDING AND YES IT IS TAKING LONG AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO. THANK ALL OF THE STATE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE TRYING THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITIES WHILE ALSO LIVING THROUGH A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THEMSELVES TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS WORK AND THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS AS SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLY CAN BE AND WE ALL KNOW. THERE ARE TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY IN WHICH CALIFORNIA TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS WORK THAT WE WILL ALSO GET TO ADDRESS BUT IT WON'T BE ADDRESSED TODAY AND IT WILL BE ADDRESSED AND FIXED TOMORROW IT'S GOING TO TAKE. TIME WE HAVE DONE OVERSIGHT THE BUDGETS OF FOUR WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE OVERSIGHT NECESSARY I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION TO TENANTS INTO RENTERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPEAKER AND THE LEADERSHIP FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND ASSOCIATIONS AND FIGHTING FOR WORKING CLASS FAMILIES ACROSS OUR STATE TO ENSURE THAT THIS FUNDING THAT THESE MONIES ACTUALLY GO TO THE MOST TO THE COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF TECHNOLOGY UNLOCK A BRAND OF BROADBAND A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OR EVEN LANGUAGE COMPETENCY. SEVERAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT NON ENGLISH SPEAKING. HAVE LACKED THE ACCESS TO ACTUALLY RECEIVE THESE FUNDS LATINOS ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY APPLY OR RECEIVE THESE MONIES AND WE GET TO WORK ON THAT AS WELL. AND THAT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PIECE CONSIDERING WHO HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS PANDEMIC. SO AGAIN THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD. WE ARE MAKING LANDLORDS 1100% WHOLE WE ARE ENSURING THAT RENTERS ARE ABLE TO STAY HOME AND CONTINUE TO BE SAFE WE ARE NOT DONE WITH COBIT THIS IS STILL AN ONGOING PANDEMIC. BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE IT OUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PEOPLE WHICH ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE DAY. IS OUR JOB. RIGHT NOW ALL. LET ME- SHARE A COUPLE OF JUST PIZZA UP BITS OF INFORMATION HERE. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS OWED AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BACK RENT NOW THERE ARE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS THAT- AN AVERAGE OF CLOSE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BACK RENT. WE CAN HELP AND THIS IS A STEP FORWARD TO DO SO I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE THAT YOU HELP THE PEOPLE YOUR CONSTITUENTS OF YOUR DISTRICTS STAY HOME STAY SAFE NOT GET EVICTED AND CONTINUE TO DO THE VERY BEST THAT THEY CAN FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE ON AB EIGHT THREE TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS CARILLO. ISRAEL'S YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I TO JOIN. AND RISING SUPPORT AS A JOINT AUTHORED THIS VITAL LEGISLATION. TODAY AS WE CONSIDER THIS LEGISLATION WE LOOK AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE STATE AND WE SEE THE PROGRESS THAT RE OPENING OUR ECONOMY GETTING VACCINES INTO ARMS AND RETURNING TO BE WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS. BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM EAST LA. L. STE HOW DID WE GET HERE WE CANNOT FORGET HOW WE GOT TO THIS MOMENT. A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC THAT HAS CLAIMED THE LIVES OF OVER SIXTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. M. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DEATHS NATIONWIDE REQUIRED THAT WE STAY AT HOME RESULTING IN WORKERS LOSING THEIR JOBS. AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE UNABLE TO PAY THEIR RENT. TODAY WE GET A CHANCE TO MAKE IT RIGHT. TO PROVIDE CONTINUED RELIEF TO THOSE THAT FACE THIS HARDSHIP THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. TODAY WE GET A CHANCE TO VOTE ON THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THE TENANTS CAN STAY IN THEIR HOMES. AND THAT LANDLORDS CAN BE PAID AND MADE WHOLE. THIS IS A TYPE OF WIN WIN LEGISLATION THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO. FOR HIS TIRELESS EFFORTS ON THIS ISSUE. I WANT TO THANK SPEAKER RENDON FOR HIS WORK AND FOR HIS TEAM'S WORK TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES AND STAKEHOLDERS. FOR THEIR INPUT. AND FEEDBACK THAT HELPED US ARRIVE AT THIS MOMENT WITH THIS I ASKED WE ALL SUPPORT. AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO. THANK YOU MISS REYES THANK YOU MEMBERS. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. MR CHIU YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL AND I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT BEEN RAISED. FIRST OF ALL- WE'VE HEARD- PARTICULARLY RECENT WEEKS ABOUT THE CONCERN OF SOME. WHO ALLEGEDLY MIGHT BEGIN IN THE SYSTEM WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY BUT OUR- LET ME SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT THAT FIRST. THE STATISTICS DON'T BEAR THAT OUT THE DAY THAT WE HAVE SEEN. OUR WHO HAS NO PAID. OF THE VA'S MAJORITY THESE AND OF. ARE WHO CALL. FOR THE FINANCIALS TO THAT WE OF FOR. BUT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE THOSE IN. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED. IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL IN THE BILL THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO VOTE ON FIRST. AS IT'S BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT MONTHS. IF A TENANT. DECLARES THAT THEY'RE ON ABLE TO PAY THEY HAVE TO A TEXAS UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. THEY HAVE TO SIGN THAT THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD BE PROSECUTED FOR FRAUD IF THEY MISTAKE. SECONDLY EVERY TENANTS IF THEY DON'T PAY RENT THERE WILL BE WILL- A 100% A MISPRINT. THIS BILL DOES NOT FORGIVE THAT. AND UNDER THE PRIOR EVICTION PROTECTION LAWS IN THE PAST WE'VE MADE IT MUCH EASIER. AND MUCH MORE INEXPENSIVE FOR LANDLORDS TO RECOVER THAT MISSING RIGHT ALLOWING THE ALERTS TO USE A SMALL CLAIMS PROCESS REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY REQUESTED OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS BROUGHT. AND IF THE TENANT HAS UNPAID RENTAL DATA ANALYST SUSAN. THAT LEONARD WILL GET A MONEY JUDGMENT FOR THE AMOUNT. ONCE THAT JUDGMENT IS ISSUED A TENANTS WAGES COULD BE GARNISHED AND FUNDS WITHDRAWN FROM THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW IF A TENANT LEAVES IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT. LANDLORDS WILL GET PAID WELL UNDER THIS BILL. AT THE REQUEST OF THE LANDLORD ADVOCATES LANDLORDS CAN APPLY TO GET PAID DIRECTLY A LANDLORD CAN INITIATE THE APPLICATION. I KNOW WE'VE HEARD FROM ANOTHER COLLEAGUES WHO IS ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT THERE IS. ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD SLOW DISBURSEMENT OF RENTAL FUNDS THUS FAR LET ME SAY I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE ON THIS CHAMBER. WHO HAS NOT BEEN FRUSTRATED AT HOW LONG IT'S TAKEN TO GET THIS MONEY OUT. BUT THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THE SLOW DISBURSEMENT THUS FAR. THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM. IT WAS JUST SET UP AT THE STATE LEVEL A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN AT THE LOCAL LEVELS. IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THEY'VE JUST STARTED IN THE LAST MONTH TO GET MONEY OUT. THEY'RE BEEN VERY COMPLICATED AND CHANGING FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL REQUIREMENTS. THE ADMINISTRATION THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY CHALLENGES IN EDUCATING. MILLIONS OF TENANTS AND LANDLORDS. LANGUAGE ACCESS DIGITAL DIVIDES. AS WELL AS- A COMPLICATED APPLICATION AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. THAT HAVE JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS BEEN STREAMLINED. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF WORK TO PROP THIS UP. AND IT IS TRUE THAT ONLY SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN PAID OUT THUS FAR BUT I WILL JUST KNOW COMPARED TO THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN REQUESTED THESE ARE THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE PENDING THUS FAR. AND WE KNOW MANY MANY MORE APPLICATIONS ARE COMING IN. WE'VE ALSO HEARD THE SUGGESTION THAT BECAUSE AN EVICTION CLIFF HAS NOT YET OCCURRED. THAT SUGGESTS ONE WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THESE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. THAT WE PREVENTED THE WORST CASE SCENARIO. THAT IS A GOOD THING. WE NEED NOT GET A TASTE OF DISASTER BEFORE WE TRY TO PREVENT THE DISASTER. LET ME JUST CLOSE BY THANKING SO MANY FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS DISCUSSION I WANT TO THANK OUR SPEAKER. MAJORITY LEADER PARTICULAR WANT TO THANK OUR STAFF FROM THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE THE HOUSING AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEES BUT- ALSO SO MANY OF YOU I'VE HAD SO MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES. YOU HAVE HELPED TO SHAPE THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE MANY STICKLES OR BEEN A PART OF IT. COLLEAGUES THIS BILL IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS HOUSED.

WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR A VOTE ON SB ONE FIFTY TWO. THANK YOU MISS TANK MR FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB ONE FIFTY TWO OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO BROUGHT TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY THIS BILL DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE IT IS ANOTHER EFFORT TO MANIPULATE THE TIMING OF AN ELECTION IS AN ATTEMPT TO PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE. TO TRY TO OBTAIN A PARTISAN OUTCOME FOR ONE SIDE. WE NEED A PAUSE AND REEVALUATE THE ACTIONS THIS BILL IS TAKING. THIS IS NOT A PATH WE SHOULD BE GOING DOWN. MOREOVER THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE HAS RECENTLY BEEN INVOLVED IN A CONTROVERSY OF HIRING A PERSON CAMPAIGN FIRM TO CONDUCT ITS OUTREACH EFFORTS. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES IN THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT CONTRACTS ARE GIVEN SOME NONPARTISAN FIRMS WHICH OUTREACH EFFORTS ARE TRULY DONE IN A NON PARTISAN MANNER. WITH NONPARTISAN MESSAGES OVER ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE SIGNED A RECALL PETITION. OUR STATE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THEM THAT OPTION. VERY AND MANY MORE WILL SHOW UP AND VOTE WHENEVER THE ELECTION IS SET. BUT THE MESSAGES SENT WITH THIS BILL. PROVES THE PUBLIC'S FRUSTRATION THAT POLITICIANS WOULD DO WHATEVER THEY CAN DO TO STAY IN POWER. MOVING THE GOALPOSTS IS ALSO UNFAIR TO OUR COUNTY CLERKS AND ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. WILL BE FORCED TO BEAR EVEN MORE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS WELL THISBILL COMPLETELY BYPASSES LEGISLATIVE REVIEW. THE ACTIONS WE ARE DEBATING TODAY. ONLY FURTHER ERODES PUBLIC TRUST WE SHOULD NOT GO DOWN THIS PATH MEMBERS I STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MR FONG MR KILEY YOUR RECOGNIZE. WE SHOULD BE VOTING IN THE RECALL RIGHT NOW THE ONLY REASON THEY WERE NOT IS THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED A NEW LAW A FEW YEARS AGO OVERHAULING THE RECALL PROCESS TO MAKE IT TAKE A LOT LONGER. NOW EVERYONE KNEW AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS A SHAM AND IT WAS DESIGNED SOLELY TO TRY TO SAVE A SITTING STATE SENATOR JOSH NEWMAN WHO WAS THEN FACING. A RECALL. NOW I WILL SAY THIS ABOUT SENATOR NEWMAN. TO HIS CREDIT. AT THE TIME HE DECLINED TO BE DIRECTLY COMPLICIT. IN THE SCHEME BEING PERPETRATED ON HIS BEHALF IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN TAT BILL WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION. HE ROSE ON THE FOR THE SENATE AND SAID THIS HE SAID NOW LET ME POINT OUT. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT HERE THAT I AM NOTTHE AUTHOR OF THESE PROVISIONS NOR DID I REQUEST THEIR INCLUSION. AND I WILL BE OF STAINING FROM VOTING ON THIS MEASURE TODAY. SENATOR NEWMAN SEEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A JUDGE. IN HIS OWN BECAUSE THAT IF THE DIRTY DEED WAS TO BE DONE BUT AT LEAST HIS FINGERPRINTS SHOULDN'T BE ON IT. THAT BARE MINIMUM LEVEL OF DECENCY. EXHIBITED BY SENATOR JOSH NEWMAN IS WAY TOO MUCH TO ASK. OF GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. THIS TRAILER BILL. WAS NEGOTIATED BY HIS ADMIN. A PAIR HIS OWN CAMP HOW TO IN IT AS THEY REFUSE MULTIPLE REQUESTS COMMENT BY THE S. PRESS. AND THE WILL ONLY TAKE A FACT WHEN GOVERNOR SIGNS IT. SO WE HAVE THE UNPRECEDENTED CIRCUMSTANCE. WHERE GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN WILL BE CHANGING CALIFORNIA LAW. IN ORDER TO TRY TO BEAT BACK HIS OWN RECALL. MISTER NAZARIAN CEDAR POINT ORDER CAN WE JUST STICK TO THE MERITS OF WHAT WE'RE HERE TO VOTE ON AND NOT JUST GO ON AND ON AND ON MISTER SPEAKER. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT. MISTER NAZARIAN OF THE POINT OF ORDER. NOW WILL TAKE A DO BELIEVE THIS KELLY SPEAKING TO. THE MEASURE BEFORE US BUT MR KILEY PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS CONFINED TO. THE ELECTIONS THAT TRAILER BILL. BEFORE THE BODY. THIS IS- YOU MAY YOU MAY HAVE MISSED SOME PARTS BUT IT'S BECOMING OVERLY POLITICAL AND IT'S ALL ABOUT. SEEING AS MANY THINGS AS NEGATIVE AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE GOVERNOR RIGHT NOW I DON'T WANT THE FLOOR TO BE MISUSED THAT WAY. THANK YOU MRS ERIN. COMMUNISTS NOTED MR KILEY MAY PROCEED THANK YOU FOR DENYING THAT POINT OF ORDER MISTER SPEAKER WE KNOW THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S MAIN SPOKESMAN ON THE ISSUE THE CENTER FOR ORINDA HAS SAID SO DIRECTLY HE SAID BEST OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT THIS RECKLESS RECALL OF GAVIN NEWSOM. IS TO HAVE AN EARLY ELECTION. HE SAID GAVIN NEWSOM SHOULD FIGHT THE BATTLE ON HIS TERMS. HE SAID HE SHOULD STRIKE WHILE HIS FAVORABLES ARE STRONG ENOUGH. THE CENTER WENT ON TELEVISION AND SAID IN MY CALCULATION THERE'S A LOT OF UNKNOWNS OUT THERE THAT COULD CHANGE THE POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'VE SEEN ON HIS BEHALF. HE CONTINUED THAT DRIVES MY POLITICAL ADVICE THE NO ACTION SOONER UNDER THE LAW WOULD BE A BETTER CIRCUMSTANCE FOR. BUT THE SENATOR GOT AHEAD OF HIMSELF. BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE LAW THAT IS THE CORRUPT ONE PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN DIDN'T ALLOW FOR THE ELECTION TO HAPPEN AS EARLY AS HE SUGGESTING. SO THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM SAID NO PROBLEM WE'LL JUST CHANGE THE LAW IN ORDER TO HAVE THE ELECTION WHEN WE THINK IT'LL GIVE US THE BEST CHANCE. TO WIN. IT IS NOT HYPERBOLE TO SAY THIS IS QUALITATIVELY THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENS IN CORRUPT SHAM DEMOCRACIES THE WORLD OVER. THOSE IN POWER USED THEIR POWER TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T LOSE THEIR POWER. THEIR INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS ORGANIZATIONS SPECIFICALLY DEVOTED TO FERRETING OUT THIS TYPE OF **** CONNERY FOR EXAMPLE THE UNITED STATES CENTER ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN ITS GUIDELINES SAYS THAT EACH TIME ALEXION'S ARE SCHEDULED. THE DATE SET OUT IN THE ELECTORAL CALENDAR FOR EACH PHASE OF THE PROCESS MUST ALLOW ADEQUATE TIME FOR EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGNING AND PUBLIC INFORMATION EFFORTS FOR VOTERS TO INFORM THEMSELVES AND FOR THE NECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL TRAINING AND LOGISTIC ARRANGEMENTS TO BE MADE. THE AS ELECTORAL KNOWLEDGE NETWORK SAYS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE MECHANISMS OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM B. AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE AND KNOWN TO BOTH VOTERS AND POLITICAL PARTIES AND CANDIDATES WELL IN ADVANCE IN ORDER TO AVOID CONFUSION. AND DISTRUST IN THE RESULTS THEY PRODUCE AND ELECTIONS. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY THROUGH ALL STATE DISTINGUISHES COUNTRIES WHERE THE ELECTORAL FRAMEWORK IS STABLE THE NECESSARY AMENDMENTS ARE ADOPTED WELL AHEAD OF THE NEXT ELECTION FROM OTHER STATES WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE ELECTION LEGISLATION OCCUR FREQUENTLY IN LATE. AND IN SOME CASES A FEW MONTHS PRIOR TO ELECTIONS IN A HASTY AND NON INCLUSIVE WAY. BUT REALLY THIS APPEAL. TO INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS IS UNNECESSARY EVERY CHILD KNOWS THE WORD FOR CHANGING THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME THIRTY SECONDS MR CRAP IT'S CHEATING. AND THE CONCLUSION IS INESCAPABLE THE GAVIN NEWSOM IS CHEATING IN THE RECALL IN THIS LEGISLATURE IS HIS WILLING ACCOMPLICE. NOW WE DON'T KNOW OF THIS SCHEME WILL WORK. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING AN EXTRAORDINARY CITIZENS MOVEMENT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FIGHTING THE ACTOR AND THE ABJECT CORRUPTION OF THIS CAPITAL. AND WHEN YOUR RESPONSE IS TO BE EVEN MORE CORRUPT IT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR CIVIC INSTITUTIONS WILL WIN OUT IN THIS ERA OF DECLINE AND FAILURE WILL BE REVERSED. AND A NEW ERA OF DECENCY AND INTEGRITY AND SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA CAN BEGIN. THANK YOU MEMBERS I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO THE LEGISLATION. THAT IS BEFORE THE BODY.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE TAX WOULD INCREASE BY OVER 3% FOR MANY OF THE BUSINESSES TO BE REGULATED BY THE CREATION OF THIS NEW BOARD. EMPLOYERS COULD END UP PAYING BETWEEN 1-000-024-0000 DOLLARS MORE PER YEAR UNDER THIS NEW PROPOSAL TROUBLING TAXES ON BUSINESSES IS WHAT DRIVES INDUSTRIES OUT OF OUR STATE WE SHARE A COMMITMENT FOR A SAFE AND HEALTHY STATE AS YOU WORK TO REOPEN THE STATE AND LEAVE THE PANDEMIC BEHIND US. BUT THIS PROPOSAL GROWS A FEELING PROPHECY AND THREATENS TO PUT NEEDED BUSINESSES OUT OF BUSINESS HI ARJUN ABOUT. THANK YOU MR FONG MISS GARCIA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU IRIS IS A PART OF THIS BILL AND I. I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE LETTER TO CERTAIN OPPOSITION WE START OFF BY SAYING THAT. THIS BILL PROVIDES RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BUSINESSES THAT WERE CURRENTLY ARE CURRENTLY PAYING A FEE OR NO LONGER GONNA HAVE TO PAY THAT FEE. IN ADDITION INDUSTRY WITH MORE THAN FIVE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED AT THE TABLE WITH US AND THEY ARE PREPARED TO PLAY THIS EXTRA FEES BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE MEANS THAT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE GET TREATED LIKE WE'RE A WASTELAND LIKE WHERE THE FULL CIVIL AND IT'S OKAY LET S. B. STICKER ON A REGULAR BASIS GENERATION AFTER GENERATION. AND SO ALL WE ARE DOING HERE IS DOING WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME AGO AND ACTING ESPONSIBLY OUT THERE WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION ON FILE FOR MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES BECAUSE THEY REALIZE. THAT THEY WANT TO BE OUR PARTNERS AND THEY WANT TO CHANGE CENTER ABOUT THEIR ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE ARE HEALTHY WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT EXCITED MY BACKYARD BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE. THAT ARE GOING TO BENEFIT BOTH FROM TE TOXIC CLEANUP BUT ALSO FROM ENSURING THAT WE HAVE BETTER FINANCIAL ASSURANCES ALONG THE WAY THAT WE HAVE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITIES ALONG THE WAY. AND THAT WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT THAT ACTUALLYIS DOING HIS JOB PROPERLY BOTH ON PERMITTING BUT ALSO ON ENFORCEMENT ALONG THE WAY INSIDE THE END OF THE DAY THE FAILURE THAT WE SEE WITH EXCITED ARE NOT YOU NEED TO JUST ACCEPT YOU SEEN THEM ACROSS THE STATE. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ONE CALIFORNIA THAT WE MADE THAT PROMISE AND IS NOT TO CALIFORNIANS AND THAT YOUR ZIP CODE OR YOUR ETHNICITY OR YOUR INCOME SHOULD NOT DICTATE THE LEVEL OF HELL TO GET TO HAVE ON A REGULAR BASIS AND SO I RESPECTFULLY.

MANY YEARS THAT THIS HAS BEEN IN IN OREGON SO I WANT TO THANK ALL THE STAFF ALL THE MEMBERS IN THE LEADERSHIP THAT HAS BEEN STEADFAST INCLUDING THE SPEAKER ON ENSURING THAT WE FINALLY GET TO THIS HISTORIC MOMENT THAT WE HAVE TODAY.

AND UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP THE AGENCY HAS PUT OUT PUBLIC METRICS ON THEIR WEBSITE INVITE INVITE YOU ALL TO LOOK AT IT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY IMPRESSIVE WHERE WE CAN SEE THE WORK THEY'RE DOING WHETHER THEY'RE HITTING THOSE METRICS AND ENSURE THAT THE MONEY THAT IS GOING TO THIS AGENCY IS WELL SPENT WHICH I THINK IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF EVERYTHING WE DO.

THIS BUDGET IS TO BUILD A FISCAL RESILIENCY IT MUST FIRST REPAY THE FUND WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STATE'S RAINY DAY FUND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY MINUTES AT THE DESK WOULD REPLACE THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TAKE FROM THE STATE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. WHICH WAS USED TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIT THAT NEVER MATERIALIZED THE STATE IS IN BETTER SHAPE NOW THAN WHEN THE GREAT RECESSION STRUCK IN LATE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC IS PUSH FOR THE STATE TO LEARN FROM THOSE YEARS AND SUCCESS WE STRUCTURE THE FIRST RAINY DAY FUND. PASSED AS PROPOSITION TWO. OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. LAST YEAR PROPOSITION TO GAVE STATE LEADERS A SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE WHEN CALIFORNIA NEEDED TO BRIDGE A ROUGHLY SIXTY. BILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET SHORTFALLS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. BUT WHEN THE FIFTY FOUR BILLION. DOLLAR DEFICIT OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG IN EFFECT THE BUDGET SURPLUS THE FIRST ACTION AS THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN WAS TO REPLACE THE FUNDS SPENT FROM ITS SAVINGS ACCOUNT. A TRUE RESPONSIBLE BUDGET WOULD HAVE CONTINUED THE DEFICIT I'M SORRY THE DECADES EFFORT TO BUILD RESERVES TO PROVIDE STABILITY IN TRUE ECONOMIC TURN DOWNS.

SENATE BILL ONE TWENTY NINE WITH AMENDMENTS BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAY ARTURO SENT TO MR SAY ARE TELL ON THE MINUTES. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS FOR HEARING IS AMENDMENTS. THAT'S FIFTEEN YEARS OF FORCED CLOSURES AS HAVE COMPLETELY DRAINED OUR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND. AS OF RIGHT NOW WE ARE CLOSE TO TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT OWED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR LOANS TO COVER THE DIFFERENCE OF OUR UNEMPLOYMENT COST. AND THAT IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF THE YEAR. CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS EXCLUSIVELY PLATE PAID INTO BY OUR EMPLOYERS IN THE COMMUNITY YOUR STATE AND FEDERAL TAXES ON WAGES. UNLESS THE STATE INTERVENES ON THIS DEBT BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO PAY. THIS THROUGH ESCALATING TAXES EACH YEAR AND THAT'S A LOT OF TAXES DID A MAKE UP TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. YET NO WE'RE IN THE BUDGET IS THERE ANY ALLOCATION WHO ADDRESS THIS TREMENDOUS DEBT. THIS FORECAST OF DEBT IS ALMOST THREE TIMES THAT OF THE WHAT IF IT'S CAUSED BY THE RECESSION. AND AWAIT ON OUR WORKERS AND BUSINESSES WILL BE IN THE BILLIONS EACH YEAR AND IT'S CLIMBING. THIS AMENDMENT I HAVE INTRODUCED WILL APPROPRIATE FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY DOWN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DEBT. AND STILL LEAVE LOTS OF ROOM FOR THE STATE TO FUND COUNTLESS OTHER PROGRAMS IN NEEDS. I AM PROPOSING FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THE NET IMPACT ON PAYING DOWN THIS MUCH OF OUR PRINCIPAL DEBT WILL RESULT IN LONG TERM REDUCTIONS IN OUR STATE'S INTEREST PAYMENTS. AND ADD TO FUTURE STABILITY. MEMBERS WE HOLD ALMOST 40% OF THIS YEAR FEDERAL LOANS. FOR THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT. A MAJORITY OF STATES HAVE ALREADY PAID OFF THEIR DEBT AND IF WE ARE TO BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WITH OUR TAXPAYERS MONEY WE NEED TO DO THE SAME. IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS AMENDMENT THANK YOU. MS REYES I MOVED TO LAY THE AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE.

WE HAVE MORE AMENDMENTS. THESE ARE MISTER SMITH'S AMENDMENTS THE CLERK WILL READ. SENATE BILL ONE TWENTY NINE WITH A MINUTES BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SIMILAR SET THREE. MISTRESS MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I AM INTRODUCING AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD INVEST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN WATER STORAGE. WE ALL KNOW HOW IMPORTANT WATER IS IN CALIFORNIA. IN TO GET TO A DROUGHT WE NEED TO STORE IT WHEN WE HAVE A WET YEAR. AND NOT LET IT GO OUT INTO THE OCEAN. INSTEAD OF CREATING REOCCURRING COST IN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT COMMIT THE STATE TO ONGOING SPENDING. WE SHOULD INVEST IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THAT WILL PROVIDE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR FAMILIES FARMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. THE OTHER DROUGHT TOOLS SUCH AS WATER TRANSFERS. CONSERVATION WATER REVIEWS MAYBE HELPFUL. BUT STILL RELY ON ACTUALLY HAVING WATER IN THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE AN UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY WITH ONE TIME FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO INVEST IN THESE PROJECTS. AS THE OLD ADAGE GOES CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE A WATER PROBLEM. WE HAVE A WATER STORAGE PROBLEM. ANOTHER OLD ADAGE I THINK YOU'VE ALL HEARD. WHISKEY'S FOR DRINKING AND WATER FOR FIGHTING LET'S QUIT FIGHTING OVER THE WATER. AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER. THE STATE HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INVESTED IN WATER STORAGE SINCE THE VOTERS APPROVED PROP ONE AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. AND ALL THOSE FUNDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN AWARDED TO PROJECTS. COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE ARE BEING TOLD TO CONSERVE WATER. WE HAVE SMALL FAMILY FARMS FOLLOWING THEIR LAND WATER IS UNAVAILABLE AND WE HAVE REAL COMMUNITIES AT RISK OF THEIR DRINKING WELLS GOING DRY. TODAY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF INVESTING ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS THAT SO THAT WE CAN BE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT DROUGHT A QUICK COMPLAINING EVERY FEW YEARS THAT WORK IN ANOTHER DROUGHT BECAUSE WE DID NOT STORE THE WATER WHEN WE HAD TO WAIT YEAR. OR ON HIGH SNOW PACK. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT.

THIS AFTER I KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE IN THE HOUR BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S A GRIEVOUS OVERSIGHT. IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET. THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY SEEING A CUT. IN A STATUS QUO BUDGET WHEN IT COMES TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION. NOW WE ARE GOING INTO WHAT COULD BE THE WORST WILDFIRE SEASON. DRIER CONDITIONS. HEATWAVES WE'RE GOING TO WHAT COULD BE THE ONE OF THE WORST WILDFIRE SEASONS. AND THAT'S A SCARY PROSPECT CONSIDERING WHAT WE BEEN THROUGH. WHAT MY COMMUNITIES BEEN THROUGH WHAT YOUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN THROUGH. TO THEN HAVE A STATUS QUO BUDGET AND EVEN A CUT FROM THE MAY REVISE. INNER WILDFIRE PREVENTION FUNDS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR WE MADE A DEAL. WITH SB NINE A ONE THAT WE WOULD PUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDS INTO WILDFIRE PREVENTION EVERY YEAR. IN THIS GOVERNOR HAS SAID HE WANTS TO DOUBLE DOWN ON. WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS LAST YEAR WE DID CAP AND TRADE DIDN'T EVEN FUND WILDFIRE PREVENTION. WE PAY THAT BACK IN THE EARLY ACTION FUNDS AND IN THIS BUDGET. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THE GOVERNOR SAID HE WAS GONNA HAVE A BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE. FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. THEN IN MAY WHEN HE RELEASED THE MAYOR REVISED SO IT'S GOING TO BE A TWO BILLION DOLLAR. PACKAGE AND IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE VOTING ON TODAY IT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE FACT. NOT A BILLION IT'S NOT TWO BILLION. IT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A STATUS QUO WILDFIRE PREVENTION BUDGET IS NOT DOUBLING DOWN. IT'S NOT GETTING OUT THE PROBLEM. AND NOW NPR HAS BROKE THE STORY THIS REVEALED THAT EVEN THE STUFF THAT WE'VE- SAID WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE JOB DONE THE GOVERNOR TOUTED NINETY THOUSAND ACRES TREATED IT'S. ELEVEN THOUSAND. WHEN WE NEED TO BE DOING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND EVERY ALL THE EXPERTS ARE SAYING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES NEED TO BE TREATED EVERY YEAR TO GET ON TOP OF THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS FUEL. WE HAVE AN OVERGROWTH OF FUELS IN OUR WILD LANDS. YOU DON'T GET OUT THAT WITHOUT GETTING OUT THERE DOING THE WORK THE THINNING. THE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT THE PRESCRIBERS. WE'VE BEEN TALKING LIKE WE'VE BEEN TALKING REAL BIG. LIKE WE'RE DOING ALL THESE THINGS IT IS NOT HAPPENING. WE'RE NOT REMOVING THE BARRIERS TOM PORTER. CALIFORNIA FIRE CAPTAIN IS SAID WE HAVE NOT REMOVED THE BUREAUCRATIC. SEQUEL BARRIERS AND OTHER BARRIERS THAT KEEP US FROM DOING THIS WORK QUICKLY AND TIMELY. THE TIME IS NOW. WE HAVE ANOTHER WILDFIRE SEASON ON THE ON THE VERGE OF WE'RE JUST GOING TO PASS A STATUS QUO BUDGET. IF THIS IS A PRIORITY WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO CHANGE IT. NOW THAT SAME ARTICLE I TALKED ABOUT SAID CONTINUED. SUSTAIN FUNDING IS WHAT IS NEEDED THAT'S WHAT THIS AMENDMENT DOES. IT SAYS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WE ARE COMMITTED CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION. THE PUTTING THAT MONEY IN THE BUDGET NOT SOME PROMISE. THE MAYBE MAYBE WE'LL GET AROUND TO IT IN THE NEXT YEAR WE GOT A BAG AND FIGHT FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION FUNDS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE AUTOMATICALLY EVERY YEAR. THAT'S WHAT THIS AMENDMENT DOES. I'M JUST ASKING YOU BECAUSE THIS IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS WHETHER YOUR FOR YOUR CITIES ARE. THREATENED BY A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE OR THE SMOKE THAT'S IN THE AIR AFTERWARDS. DON'T LET THIS JUST GO BY MAN AND PASS ANOTHER STATUS QUO BUDGET ON A WILDFIRE PREVENTION DON'T ALLOW THIS GOVERNOR TO GET AWAY WITH SAYING HEY I'M DOING. MORE THAN EVER ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND IT TURNS OUT NO IT'S NOT TRUE. HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS. AND I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATED FUNDING TO GET OUT WHAT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN IT COMES TO COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND STOPPING CARBON EMISSIONS. THANK KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AND KEEPING OUR AIRCRAFT SAFE AND CLEAN.

AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS TRULY IS. A HISTORIC BUDGET. WHEN I STOOD UP HERE A YEAR AGO. WE WERE THREE MONTHS IN THE CLOVER WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVEANY IDEA. WHAT WE WERE GOING TO FACE FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS IT HAS BEEN QUITE. A CRAZY RIDE. WE PASS A PESSIMISTIC BUDGET WE PASSED THE BUDGET THAT WE THOUGHT. WAS GONNA BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HUGE LOSS OF REVENUE THAT WE ACTUALLY. DIDN'T SEE. NOT ONLY DO WE NOT SEE. REVENUE GO DOWN WE HAVE TO SELL REVENUE GO UP. THERE ARE KIND OF ME CONTINUING TO GENERATE THE REVENUE THAT WE SORELY NEED. TO HELP SO MANY WORKING CALIFORNIA'S TO HELP SOMEBODY STRUGGLING. CALIFORNIANS WILL BE RELEASED ARE BUDGET BLUEPRINT EARLIER THIS YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT FOUR MAJOR THEMES. ONE WAS TO PRESERVE TO PRESERVE. THE PROGRAM TO DOES REALLY BRING BACK THE MONEY FROM THE CUTS THAT WE HAD MADE. IN THIS YEAR IN THIS CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET. WE WANTED TO RESPOND TO KOBE TO MAKE SURE WE WERE DOING EVERYTHING. TO RESPOND WHETHER THAT WASON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE WITH THE DEVIL IS LOOKING AT WILD FIRES OR DROP REALLY RESPONDING TO THE MOMENT FOR THIS LAST TWELVE MONTHS. WE ALSO WANTED TO PROTECT FAMILIES WITHOUT SO MANY FAMILY SO MANY SENIORS SO MANY KIDS. WHO REALLY. ALREADY STRUGGLING BEFORE. WE GOT TO THIS VERY VERY POINT. AND THE LASTLY WE KNOW WE IT WAS ENOUGH TO PROTECT WE NEEDED TO RECOVER. SO THIS BUDGET. DOES THAT AND SO MUCH MORE. WE ARE ABLE TO PRESERVE BY RESTORING ALL THE CUTS THE LEAD IN BILLION DOLLARS TO RESTORE THOSE CUTS TO SENT TO SCHOOLS. ALL ACROSS THE STATE I KNOW SO MANY FOLKS WERE VERY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE OUR SCHOOLS FOR ME HOLE AS WELL AS UCCS YOU ARE COURTS. WE RESPONDED. WE RESPONDED AND THEN SOME THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE YEAR WE JUST VOTED ON AN EVICTION MORE TWENTY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T SEE MASS EVICTIONS WE HAD MORE TIME TO GET MONEY OUT. TO STRUGGLING TENANTS LANDLORDS WHO REALLY REALLY NEED TO THOSE RESOURCES. WE RESPONDED TO. EVERYTHING OF NATIONAL THAT WE CAN SEE FROM THIS PANDEMIC WHETHER IT WAS MASS WHETHER IT WAS TESTING WHETHER IT'S VACCINATION AND IT FELT LIKE EVERY FEW MONTHS. EVERYTHING WAS CONSTANTLY CHANGING. THIS BUDGET IS ALSO COMPLETELY ABOUT PROTECTION. WHICH PROTECTION IT'S PROTECTING THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO WORE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM HOMELESSNESS FOUR ONE UNEMPLOYMENT CHECK AWAY FROM HOMELESSNESS WHO WERE ONE SERVICE AWAY FROM SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING TO THEM. WE SAW YOU HEARD ME PRESENT ABOUT THE GOLDEN STATE THE MOST EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FOR FAMILIES WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED MONEY INTO GETTING MONEY BACK YOU SAW ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND GRANTS THAT THEY NEEDED TO REALLY KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. WE I PROTECTING FAMILIES WHO REALLY NEED HEALTH CARE WHAT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT A PANDEMIC. THE HEALTH CARE NOT ONLY ARE WE TAKING WITH THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FROM MEDIC MEDIC CAL FOR SIXTY AND OLDER BUT NOW WE ARE OFFERING MEDI CAL REGARDLESS. OF HOW YOU ARE HERE IN THIS STATE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE FIFTY AND OVER. WE HAD A RATE STUDY ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABLED COMMUNITY. WE SAW. I THINK MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS ACADEMIC FOR ALL THOSE FAMILIES WHO RELY ON THOSE CENTERS EVERY SINGLE DAY IT WAS ANYTHING BUT- WE ARE FINALLY. MAKING THAT PROMISE THAT WE HAVE PROMISED THEM. A REALITY. SO OVER FIVE YEARS WE ARE WE ARE DOING THAT ONE BILLION DOLLAR. RATE INCREASE THAT WE HAVE SO NEEDED TO DO FOR SO MANY SO MANY YEARS. HOMELESSNESS A YEAR AGO IT SEEMS LIKE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO BUT OVER A YEAR AGO THE GOVERNOR WAS ON THIS FLOOR TALKING ABOUT ONLY ONE ISSUE AND ONE ISSUE ONLY WHICH IS HOMELESSNESS. TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL MONEY TO HOMELESSNESS ONE BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR ONE BILLION ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS ISSUE ONE BILLION DOLLARS NEXT YEAR. THE CITIES COUNTIES CONTINUES OF CURE TOTAL FLEXIBLE FUNDING INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE INVESTMENT ON HOMELESSNESS BACK. WE ALSO HEARD MONEY IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIES COUNTIES CAN TEAMS OF CARE NONPROFIT EVERY DEVELOPER. WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR EACH AND EVERY SINGLE NICKEL WE'RE INVESTING IN EVERY COMMUNITY. EDUCATION FOR WHO THOUGHT RE OPENING SCHOOLS WAS GOING TO BE A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC THIS YEAR IF THE TALK WITHOUT GOING TO SCHOOL IS A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC. YET WALLACE NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING TO REOPEN SCHOOLS THE SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO GET A RECORD AMOUNT OF FUNDING OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER PUPIL SO NOT ONLY CAN THE HELP WITH LEARNING RECOVERY BUT THEY CAN ALSO GET THE CRITICAL MONEY THEY NEED TO. LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR CHILDREN UNIVERSAL TICKET WE TALKED ABOUT UNIVERSITY K. A YEAR AGO IT'S BEEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT UNIVERSAL T. K. FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS ONLY 25% OF KIDS. GET TEEKAY NOW WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT EVERY SINGLE FOUR YEAR OLD EVENTUALLY THE STATE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL BE GETTING TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. EVERYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE STATE. SO MANY OF US I ALWAYS JOKE WE END UP HIDING IN MAY. IN APRIL BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU SEE. LETTERS COME OUT. THAT WE HAVE SO MANY FAMILIES WHO. WORK HARD KIDS THAT WORK HARD KICK IT INTO. THE UC OF THEIR CHOICE. SO WE ARE BUYING. UC SAN DIEGO UC BERKELEY UCLA OUT. AND MAKING SURE. THAT WE HAVE. MORE SLOTS OPEN THERE FOR CALIFORNIANS. IT ON TOP OF THE UC HAS ALWAYS. BEEN CRITICIZED MITT MADE BY MANY OF US IN THIS BODY FROM SPENDING TOO MUCH. ON ADMINISTRATION. AND NOT ENOUGH ON STUDENTS WE WILL CONTINUE. THAT OVERSIGHT OVER THEIR ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY. DOESN'T GO TO THE BUREAUCRATS IN OAKLAND BUT MAKE SURE IT GETS IN THE CLASSROOMS IN BERKELEY IN LOS ANGELES. AND IN SAN DIEGO AND ON TOP OF THAT WERE ALSO INCLUDED. IN THE APPROPRIATIONS MONEY FOR CSU SOPHOMORE. CALIFORNIANS WHO COULDN'T GET IN TO SEE ISSUE BECAUSE- MANY BE IMPACTED. UNIVERSITIES DIDN'T HAVE ROOM. ARE UNABLE TO DO THAT. MEMBERS THIS REALLY IS A BUDGET. OF A LIFETIME IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. A HUNDRED NINETY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF OUR GENERAL FUND. AND FOR SO MANY OF US THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESERVES THE RECORD HIGH AMOUNT OF USERS. TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVES. THIS IS A BUDGET THAT REALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR VALUES ARE PROTECTING. THE MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES THE FAMILIES WHO NEED OUR HELP THE MOST AT THE TIME OF THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO. WELL INTO THE FUTURE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON SB ONE TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER TANK. MR FONG IF YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. A TWO WEEKS AGO THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BUDGET FRAMEWORK A FRAMEWORK THAT RAISE CONCERNS OF ON SUSTAINABILITY THAT LACK IMPORTANT DETAILS AND DID NOT PROVIDE ANY STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO BROKEN AND MISMANAGED PROGRAMS AND SYSTEMS TODAY. WE'RE BEING ASKED TO PASS A BUDGET YOU POINT NOW. THIS SEQUEL IS JUST AS CONCERNING AS THE ORIGINAL. THIS BILL CONTAINS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY AMENDMENTS AND HUNDREDS OF NEW APPROPRIATIONS BUT STILL LACKS IMPORTANT SPECIFICS AGAIN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS WARRANT MERIT. BUT THIS BILL LIKE THE LAST FRANK FRAMEWORK FAILS TO ADDRESS THE BASICS FOR CALIFORNIANS IT DOES NOT BIG CD AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE THAT MANY UNEMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS RELY ON AS THEIR LIFELINE. A SYSTEM THAT HAS A GROWING BACKLOG WITH OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS STILL TRAPPED IN ITS BUREAUCRACY. IT DOES NOT PAY DOWN THE MOUNTING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND DEBT NOT ONE DOLLAR. AGAIN NOT ONE DOLLAR IS IN THIS BUDGET FRAMEWORK THAT DEALS WITH THIS THAT. THE BIGGER THIS THAT GETS THE HIGHER THE TAXES WILL GET FOR BUSINESS IS STILL STRUGGLING ON THE HILL THE ON THE HEELS OF THIS PANDEMIC A DEBT THAT WAS INCURRED BECAUSE OF STATE MISMANAGEMENT. BY CONTINUING TO DEPRIVE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES SUBSTANTIAL SUBSTANTIAL RELIEF THE STATE IS INCREASING AN ALREADY HIGH TAX BURDEN IN STIFLING THEIR ABILITY TO RECOVER. ALREADY PERSEVERING THROUGH UNCERTAINTY FAILING TO ACT ON THIS CRITICAL PRIORITY IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. THIS BILL DOES NOT REPAY THE SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS TAKEN AT THE RAINY DAY FUND. WE ALL AGREE MORE SAVINGS IS BETTER THAN SIMPLY MORE SPENDING. EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS THE INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO FIGHT WILDFIRES IN BRING RELIEF TO THIS EXTREME DROUGHT. WILDFIRE AND DROUGHT OR DUAL THREATS THAT FACE CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW A WILDFIRE PREVENTION THE RHETORIC ISN'T MATCHING THE REALITY AS IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION FOR THIS UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR. WE NOT ONLY NEED CERTAINTY BUT SUSTAINED FUNDING RIGHT NOW WITH THE MERE HOPE OF MORE ACTION THE FUTURE IS UNACCEPTABLE IN FACT THERE'S A FIRE BURNING IN KERN COUNTY AT THIS VERY MOMENT. WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND WATER STORAGE MUST BE PART OF ANY LONG TERM JOB SOLUTION. AGAIN THE DETAILS IN THIS AGREEMENT STILL REMAIN LACKING. WE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE SEEING THE HUMAN AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF OUR STATE'S FAILURE TO INVEST IN WATER STORAGE YEARS AGO. WE NEED STORAGE AND CONVEYANCE IMPROVEMENTS TO ENSURE A SUSTAINABLE AND RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY FOR AND OUR ENTIRE STATE. I'M AFRAID THAT THIS WILL BE ANOTHER MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE GROWING AND LOOMING THREATS. CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING AN AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IT'S UNDENIABLE IN CALIFORNIANS AND BUSINESSES ARE LEAVING OUR STATE. THAT'S RESTORE PERMANENTLY THE TAX RELIEF THAT IS NEEDED THAT WILL HELP OUR ECONOMY AND MAKE OUR STATE MORE COMPETITIVE TO OTHER STATES. NOW IS THE TIME TO PLAN RESPONSIBLY TO BUILD UP OUR RESERVES ARE REDUCING THE BURDENS ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES. THE NEED FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION WATER STORAGE AND PERMANENT TAX RELIEF OR JUST AS URGENT NOW AS THEY WERE TWO WEEKS AGO AND EVEN TWO YEARS AGO AND CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL SUFFERING UNDER MISMANAGEMENT IN OUR STATE AGENCIES THAT CONTINUE TO FAIL THEM. AS I SAID TWO WEEKS AGO LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING. POURING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO BROKEN SYSTEMS IT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE PLEADING FOR RELIEF THAT THIS BUDGET DOESN'T PROVIDE WE NEED TO DEVELOP A SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS AND WHILE FOR PREVENTION AND WATER STORAGE WHICH THE DETAILS STILL ARE ARE NOT THERE. THIS BUDGET ADMITTEDLY IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT I'M AFRAID THAT THIS BUDGET IS NOT ADEQUATE TACKLING CRITICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS. EVERY CALIFORNIAN EXPECTS US TO TACKLE MEMBERS I URGE A NO VOTE ON SB ONE TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU MR FONG MR KILEY. YOUR RECORD LAST. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- WE CONSIDER THIS BUDGET AT A MOMENT WHEN CALIFORNIA LAGS BEHIND THE REST OF THE NATION- IN ALMOST EVERY WAY NOT BECAUSE OF A VIRUS WHICH HIT EVERY STATE BUT BECAUSE OF OUR GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE. FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN MONTHS CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL OUT WIRE AND ALL THE WORST WAYS. WE'VE GOT A LONGER SCHOOL CLOSURES THE MOST PUNISHING LOCKDOWNS AND THE NATION'S WORST PERFORMING BUREAUCRACY. AND THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES ACHIEVEMENT GAPS IN OUR SCHOOLS HAVE EXPLODED. OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS BEEN CLOSE TO THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY. WHEN IT COMES TO UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS BOTH THE BACKLOG OF UNRESOLVED CLAIMS AND THE SCALE OF FRAUDULENT CLAIMS IS UNSURPASSED END. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE AMONG THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY WITH AN EXCESS MORTALITY RATE HIGHER THAN FORTY FOUR STATES. WITH THIS UNDER PERFORMANCE ISN'T JUST A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS IT CONTINUES INTO THE PRESENT WITH AMONG THE NATION'S WEAKEST ECONOMIC RECOVERIES. ABOUT HALF OF THE JOBS THAT WERE LOST HAVE BEEN RECOVERED AYE MERE HALF. SMALL BUSINESS OPENINGS ARE DOWN 40% OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT REMAIN OPEN 40% ARE UNDERSTAFFED. THIS LAST MONTH WE ADDED JUST TWELVE THOUSAND WORKERS. NOW PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE STATE IS IT RATIONALLY CLINGING TO A PANDEMIC MENTALITY. WE REFUSED AND OUR STATE OF EMERGENCY EVEN THOUGH THE STATE OF NEW YORK FOR EXAMPLE HAS. WE'RE STILL WEARING FEES EVEN THOUGH DOCTOR FOUND G. HIMSELF IS TESTIFYING IN CONGRESS WITHOUT ONE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT MESSAGE THAT SENDS. BUT THE OTHER PART OF THE PROBLEM. IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN PLANNING FOR FAILURE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ESTIMATED THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD BE EIGHT POINT 5% FOR THIS ENTIRE YEAR. AT THE TIME SOME STATES ALREADY HAD AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HALF OF THAT. AND OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS SAYING EIGHT POINT DOCUMENT. IT FORECAST THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD NOT RETURN TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS INTO THE TWO TILL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE. A FIVE YEAR RECOVERY. SO THAT IS THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT FOR TODAY'S BUDGET. IS ECONOMIC MALAISE THAT WAS CONSCIOUSLY PLANNED AND IS BEING NEEDLESSLY PERPETUATED. SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU A DESCRIPTION OF THE BUDGET IN THE GOVERNOR'S OWN WORDS HERE'S HOW HE DESCRIBES THIS CALIFORNIA COMEBACK PLANHE SAID MORE DOLLAR SIGNS DOLLAR SIGNS FOR STIMULUS CHECK MORE DOLLAR SIGN DOLLAR SIGN FOR SMALL BUSINESSES MORE DOLLAR SIGN DOLLAR SIGN FOR OUR KIDS. MORE DOLLAR SIGN DOLLAR SIGN TO CLEAN OUR STREETS MORE DOLLAR SIGN DOLLAR SIGN TO FIGHT WILDFIRES I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS BUT IT'S NOT GOVERNING. IT'S NOT LEADERSHIP AND YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT. LISTEN TO THE GOVERNOR'S OWN MENTAL HEALTH CZAR. WHO SAID THAT THE PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESS IT'S NOT A MONEY PROBLEM. IT'S A LEADERSHIP PROBLEM YEAH HERE WE ARE THROWING TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS MORE AT IT. WITHOUT ACTUALLY FINDING ANY REAL SOLUTIONS. REAL POLITICAL LEADERSHIP WOULD SEEK TO GET OUR ECONOMY BACK AT FULL TILT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WHILE PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR A SUSTAINED RECOVERY. THAT WOULD INCLUDE FINANCIAL RELIEF. THAT IS MEANT TO PROVIDE A REAL SOCIAL SAFETY NET WHERE IT'S NEEDED BUT PROVIDES THE RIGHT INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK AND BY THE WAY THAT INCLUDES MAKING SURE PARENTS CAN RETURN TO WORK. BY HAVING EVERY SCHOOL IN THE STATE BE OPEN FULL TIME FOR THIS COMING SCHOOL YEAR. NO EXCUSES. THERE IS SO MUCH OTHER LOW HANGING FRUIT IF WE HAD A BUDGET THAT WAS GROWTH ORIENTED. AND PUBLIC SPIRITED WE COULD FORGIVE ALL COVERT RELATED FINES PENALTIES AND LICENSE REVOCATIONS. WE PROVIDE LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR BUSINESSES WE COULD REFORM PAGA ANOTHER LITIGATION FRAPPES WE CAN OFFER MEANINGFUL TAX RELIEF SUCH AS NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY BACKS. WE CAN REMOVE ARBITRARY BARRIERS TO WORK. LIKE AB FIVE WE CAN ADDRESS THE SO CALLED SURPLUS WITH DURABLE TAX REFORM. RATHER THAN RATHER THAN ARBITRARY ONE TIME PAYMENTS THIRTY SECONDS. FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS THE POPULATION OF THE STATE GREW. THIS LAST YEAR IT DECLINED BY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. WE JUST LOST A SEAT IN CONGRESS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER THIS USED TO BE THE STATE WHERE ANYONE COULD GET AHEAD IT'S NOW THE STATE THAT MANY CAN'T WAIT TO LEAVE BEHIND BUT I FOR ONE. DON'T DO MY JOB AS DIVVYING UP THE SPOILS ON A SINKING HIP IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO TURN THINGS AROUND IF WE START MAKING BETTER CHOICES AND I LOOK FORWARD AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE DAY WILL SOON ARRIVE WHEN CALIFORNIA CAN START LEADING THE NATION. IN THE RIGHT WAYS AGAIN. DR ARAMBULA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THIS BUDGET DOES NOT GET US BACK TO NORMAL AS THAT WAS NOT OUR INTENT BUT INSTEAD IT GETS US TO A BETTER PLACE BY MAKING TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE FOR CALIFORNIA. IT IS LONG BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SOCIAL INEQUITIES AND UNDER FUNDED PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. AFFECTS THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS. AND IN THE INTEREST OF NOT LETTING A GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE OUR PLAN INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THESE ISSUES. I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR THE BOLDNESS OF HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS VISION FOR OUR STATE AND BY LEADING WITH A RESOURCE MENTALITY. I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP FOR THE BUDGET OF OPPORTUNITY AND FOR LEADING THE STATE IN A DIRECTION AND PLACE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THE MOST VULNERABLE CAN FIND A BETTER PLACE THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN IN BEFORE. I AM THRILLED THAT THIS BUDGET SUPPORTS HOPE FOR ALL EXPANDING FULL SCOPE MEDICARE OLD REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS FOR THOSE THAT ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY. IT IS CRITICAL THAT OUR STATE ACT NOW TO PROTECT ALL LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. THE INVESTMENTS IN OUR PLAN REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE CARE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED TODAY. BUT THE CALIFORNIA THAT WE ALL WANT OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TO GROW UP IN IN A POST PANDEMIC FUTURE. I THANK YOU AND I URGE YOUR VOTE FOR SB ONE TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU DOCTORING THAT MEMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES AT THIS TIME. MISTER BASS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS ARRIVED TODAY TO VOCALIZE MY DISAPPOINTMENT IN THIS BUDGET. SPECIFICALLY I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY WITHIN THE PROCESS. AS YOU WILL KNOW. THE MEASURES WERE VOTING ON TODAY HAVE BARELY BEEN IN FRONT SEVENTY TWO HOURS WHY WE WAITED TILL SIX FIFTEEN TONIGHT STEVEN GET THIS PROCESS STARTED. OUR STAKEHOLDERS BACK HOME NO NOT AT ADEQUATE TIME TO REVIEW THESE MEASURES. AND UNFORTUNATELY TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE. MOST OF THIS BILL IS SO VAGUE THE NO ONE EVEN KNOWS. WHAT IS REALLY IN IT WHAT THE VERY SPECIFIC ITEMS DO. IN WHERE THE DETAILED FUNDING GAPS. MEMBERS WE JUST IGNORED. SIX AMENDMENTS THAT COULD HELP CLARIFY THAT. SIX AMENDMENTS AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS EDT UNEMPLOYMENT THIS HUGE GAPPING DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE IGNORED LAID ON THE TABLE. BUDGET STABILIZATION LAID ON THE TABLE. WILDFIRE PREVENTION FUNDING IS MISSION FROM MY COLLEAGUE IN BAKERSFIELD MY DISTRICT ALONE IS ALREADY HAD THREE WILDFIRES. THIS WILDFIRE SEASON IS GOING TO BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE LAST. BUT AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS FUNDING FOR THAT TO ADD ACTUAL TRANSPARENCY. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S WORD ON IT IT IS FALSE. AND THAT'S BEEN LAID ON THE TABLE. WATER STORAGE AND CONVEYANCE. I REPRESENT THE CITY WITHOUT WATER. I'VE ALREADY HAD CALLS. LITTLE TOWN A TEMPEST IN. YA CAN'T EVEN FIND ON A MAP. OUR WATER WELLS DRIED OUT. WHERE'S THE FUNDING FOR THEM- LAID ON THE TABLE. EDUCATION. MAKING SURE EVERY STUDENT IS TRULY TAKING CARE OF EVERY OPTION. SCHOOL CHOICE THE ABILITY FOR OUR KIDS TO LEARN. AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT LAID ON THE TABLE. AND OF COURSE THE GAS TAX. LAID ON THE TABLE. MEMBERS I DO APPLAUD. THE HARD WORK OF A SELECT FEW INDIVIDUALS. WHO CRAFTED THIS BUDGET. BECAUSE THEY DID GET A FEW THINGS RIGHT. SPECIFICALLY THE FUNDING FOR ITV COMMUNITY. FUNDS FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH. AND INVESTMENTS INTO NEWER HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES INSTEAD OF PLACING ALL THE EGGS IN THE ELECTRIFICATION BASKET. SO I DO APPLAUD THAT. HOWEVER THERE'S SO MUCH WRONG. WITH THIS BILL BUT I COULD FRANKLY SPENT HOURS GOING THROUGH IT BUT YOU ALL LIKE YOU ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES. THIS BUDGET DOES NOTHING TO REDUCE OUR HIGH TAX RATES. AND OFFERING MEANINGFUL RELIEF TO STRUGGLING FAMILIES. WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW COME IT'S SO EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA HOW DO WE HELP THESE FAMILIES WHAT ARE WE DOING TO LOWER THE COST OF LIVING FOR STRUGGLING FAMILIES. I'VE BEEN TO REPORT. I KNOW WHERE I COME FROM. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE. GOING TO THE STORE WAIT WITH YOU I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS THE EBT CHECK. AND HAVING TO GO AND DO THAT. I KNOW WHAT THOSE STRUGGLES ARE LIKE I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO DO I GET THE OIL CHANGED BY MY KID A NEW PAIR OF SHOES. THIRTY SECONDS. WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. BARTY DISCUSS THE TAXES THE WILDFIRES THE WATER THE RAINY DAY FUND. MEMBERS DON'T YOU SCOLDED AS AN EXCUSE AUGUST AND WITH THIS THIS BILL OR VOTING ON TODAY. IS A SLAP IN THE FACE OR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THIS IS THE LARGEST SHELL GAME. IN THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE YEAR HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. YA KNOW BETTER THAN THIS YOUR COULD DO BETTER THAN THIS NEVADA AMPLE TIME IN THE ABILITY TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT. AND WE'VE CHOSEN NOT TO. I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO DO BETTER. VOTE NOW. MR MCCARTY YOUR RECORD THANK YOU YOU KNOW WE HAD A BIG DEBATE ON THIS TWO WEEKS AGO AND OUR BUDGET SHARED A NICE JOB OF LAYING IT OUT SO I'LL TRY NOT TO REPEAT BUT AGAIN THIS IS A PRUDENT BUDGET WITH UPWARDS OF TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVE A REBOUNDING FOR THE FUTURE BUT REALLY- FOCUSING ON THE PRESENT AS WELL. IT WAS SAID THAT THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIONAL BUDGET YOU COULD OVER USE THOSE WORDS IN IN PUBLIC OFFICE BUT THIS REALLY IS ONE OF THOSE BUDGETS THIS IS THE BEST BUDGET FOR EDUCATION IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA AND I WILL SAY THAT THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DONE WE HAVE NOT STEPPED UP FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS EARLY EDUCATION FOR COLLEGE IT'S NOT JUST THE LESS THE ACTIONS HERE ARE PROVEN THAT WILL CHANGE LIVES FROM EARLY EDUCATION AS WAS NOTED. OVER HALF A MILLION KIDS WELL ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVE A CHANCE TO GO TO A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WITH UNIVERSAL T. K. WITH EXPANDED CHILD CARE WITH ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS. A VIABLE PROGRAMS THAT PAY THEIR WORKERS A LIVING WAGE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE RATES FOR THESE PROGRAMS- MAKING SURE WE EXPAND MORE OF THESE SITES WITH ONE TIME MONEY FOR FACILITIES. FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE FALL. NO MISTAKE WILL BE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE FALL. AS OUR BUDGET SHARE NOTED. RECORD FUNDING TO MAKE SURE WE CAN HIRE ENOUGH TEACHERS AND FIND TRUE CLASS SIZE REDUCTION. UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS SO KIDS WON'T GO TO SCHOOL HUNGRY NAKED FOCUS ON LEARNING. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS UNIVERSALLY SO PARENTS CAN GO TO WORK. I KNOW THEIR KIDS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AFTER SCHOOL AND NOT GETTING IN TROUBLE. EVERYBODY ON THIS FLOOR ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT C. T. E. HOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE. ALL OF YOU LOVE C. T. THIS BUDGETS GOING TO DOUBLE. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR CITY THAT'S ONE THING GO BACK HOME TELL YOUR PEOPLE YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. DOUBLING SUPPORT FOR C. T. FOR COLLEGE. WE KNOW THAT THE TICKET TO THE MIDDLE CLASS MORE HIGHER EDUCATION WE NEED MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES WE WANT PEOPLE TO SUCCEED THIS. BILL FULLY FUNDS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE SUPER COLON GROWTH. PROVIDES OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND NEW SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIANS TO GO TO UC AND CSU. AS OUR BUDGETARY NOTED EARLIER WE GET SLAMMED EVERY YEAR BECAUSE TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS APPLY TO YOU SEE. AND CAN'T GET IN AND ADD INSULT TO INJURY OUT OF STATE STUDENTS TAKE THEIR SLOTS IN LA SAN DIEGO IN BERKELEY WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THOSE NUMBERS TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND WE'RE TRULY GOING TO FIND FINANCIAL AID THAT MAKES COLLEGE DEBT FREE IN CALIFORNIA BY DRAMATICALLY EXPANDING OUR CAL GRANT AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM SO THIS REALLY IS A BUDGET.

AND STRUCK BY MANY OF THE COMMENTS ACROSS THE- PARTISAN DIVIDE ON THIS FLOOR AND IN TERMS OF HIS BUDGET I MEAN I FEEL LIKE I'M LISTENING TO A CABLE NEWS. YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT THIS IS. PROBABLY AS GOOD AS IT'S GOING TO GET IN TERMS OF. A BUDGET THAT WE CAN PASS IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING. I N. HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION AND FIGHTING HOMELESSNESS ON SO MANY DIFFERENT FRONTS. AND SO I WILL PROUDLY SUPPORT THIS BILL- BUT- YOU KNOW I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT- YOU KNOW IT IT THERE ARE SOME POINTS OF CONCERN. THAT IS- TO CROSS PARTY LINES YOU KNOW I DO WISH THAT THERE WAS MORE FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET TO ADDRESS WILDFIRE PREVENTION YOU KNOW I HEAR. MY COLLEAGUE- REPRESENTING PARADISE TO WHICH YOU WANT TO AVOID. THE YOU KNOW IT IT TWO TWO. BASICALLY WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE SPENDING MORE FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION BECAUSE- I MEAN IT'S- WE ARE SO WE ARE ON THE FRONT LINES IN AND SEEING THE CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- WE NEED TO FEEL THAT MORE OF THAT SENSE OF URGENCY AND FIGHTING THE WILDFIRES WE NEED TO SPEND MORE MONEY TO REDUCE THE FUEL TO FIGHT. WILDFIRES AND ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW I AS AS MUCH AS I WELCOME THE RECORD AMOUNT OF SPENDING. TO FIGHT HOMELESSNESS YEAH I WANT TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE HAVE PASSED MEASURES LIKE MEASURE H. AND MEASURE HHH WERE THE TAXPAYERS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. HAVE AFFIRMATIVELY VOTED WITH OVERWHELMING MAJORITY TO INCREASE TAXES ON THEMSELVES TO FIGHT. THIS HOMELESS CRISIS THAT WE'RE SEEING YOU KNOW. APPEARING IN SO MANY OF OUR OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND YET WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS GETTING LARGER AND LARGER IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOW I KNOW THAT. HOMELESSNESS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT THAT THE IT'S LIKELY. THAT YOU KNOW TRYING TO CAPTURE WATER WITH THE NET THAT THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE THAT CONTINUE TO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS EVEN AS WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN BUILDING MORE. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS WELL AS TEMPORARY SHELTERS. BUT I JUST HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN I WAS LISTEN TO THE BUDGET SHARE PRESENTING. THIS BILL AND THE BUDGET. COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY THAT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DETAILS IN TERMS OF THE HOMELESS SPENDING YOU KNOW ARE STILL TO BE DETERMINED ESPECIALLY THE DETAILS IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN IN TERMS OF THE SPENDING. IT UP WE CAN'T JUST SHOVEL MONEY AT THE PROBLEM. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING WELL SPENT. IT ALL IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'VE WE'VE HAD REPORTS THE LOS ANGELES CONTROLLER CAME OUT OF REPORT SAYING THAT THE AVERAGE COST OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. AND HIGHER WHEREAS I KNOW THAT TO IT AND MY COMMUNITIES THE CITY OF REDONDO BEACH FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN THEY'VE THEY'VE STEPPED UP THEIR THEIR- THEY THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE A CREATED- A PILOT PROJECT TO. TO- BUILD V. THE PALACE SHELTERS THE THAT THE TEMPORARY SHELTERS THAT ARE THAT ARE SUPPORTED WITH THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT WE NEED THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. THOSE EACH ONE OF THOSE UNITS COSTS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ACCORDING TO THE CITY OF REDONDO BEACH TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL A TOOL SHED. VERSUS PERMANENT HOUSING BUT THE FACT IS THAT YOU KNOW WHILE WE CONTINUE TO DELAY AND GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS THE PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY DAY ON THE STREETS PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN THIS TENSE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS. YOU KNOW AT LEAST THESE THESE TOOL SAYS THESE PALACE. YOU KNOW SHELTERS IT'S A IT'S A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD WHEN IT'S RAINING WHEN THE WHEN THE WEATHER'S BAD IT'S A CLEAN BED AND IS MOST IMPORTANTLY IS SUPPORTED WITH THESE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. SO WE CAN DO BOTTOM LINE IS WE CAN DO BETTER IN TERMS OF MAKING PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HOMELESSNESS WE CAN'T JUST SHOVEL MONEY AT THE PROBLEM WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING WELL SPENT. AND SO I HOPE THAT THE TRIP OF THE FORTHCOMING TRAILER BILL ON THE ON THE HOMELESS SPENDING WILL PROVIDE FOR THAT ACCOUNTABLE ABILITY SO AT THE VERY LEAST NO SO THAT WE KNOW HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. RATHER THAN JUST YOU KNOW GIVING A BLANK CHECKS TO OUR OUR OUR LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES TO FIGHT THIS CRISIS. MISTER ROSS. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOUNG MAN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO THANK THIS- LEGISLATURE ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE MOVING FORWARD- WITHIN THE BUDGET TO START TO ADDRESS.
