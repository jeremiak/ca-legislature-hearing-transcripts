00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:05.863

BEFORE US.

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:20.777
AND MY QUESTION ALMOST THE SAME

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:25.782
AS SENATOR HILL IN A MINUTE.

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:27.584
A LITTLE HIGHER ON THIS QUESTION --

00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:29.253
THE ORAL BOARD --

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:30.754
THAT YOU YOU CONDUCT EVERY

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:33.090
SINGLE YEAR I'M SURE TO GET

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:34.491
PEOPLE IN AND SO ON THE THE

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:36.627
QUESTION ABOUT THE ORAL SURGEON

00:46:36.693 --> 00:46:38.428
IT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT.

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:41.498
BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OR

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.567
AND HOPEFULLY THAT ONE DAY THAT

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:45.369
THERE WILL BE SOMEONE --

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:47.571
ON THE BOARD OF THE COMPLETE THE

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.273
THE A PRACTICING DENTIST BUT

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:51.475
ALSO THE EDUCATION STANDARDS IT

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:53.043
MUST ALSO BE MET BY THE

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.444
REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:56.180
ASSISTING THAT DR.

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:58.182
SO WE NEED TO SEE WHERE THAT

00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:59.750
EDUCATION IS GOING TO MATCH.

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:02.319
THE THE PRACTICE OF FOR SURGERY.

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:04.221
AND WITH TRANSPLANTS AND THINGS

00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:09.426
THAT ARE TAKING PLACE.

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:10.727
AND I WOULD IMAGINE THE NUMBER

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:11.962
OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE'VE HEARD --

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:12.930
BECAUSE WHEN YOU YOU'RE WATCHING

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:13.964
A TV COMMERCIAL THAT SAID YOU

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.132

WITH A COMPLETE SET OF TEETH.

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:19.369
AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:20.938
AN ORAL SURGEON THE THE

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:22.839
PRACTICING DENNIS WILL ALWAYS

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:26.510

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.882
ADVERTISEMENT THAT IS IN SOME

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:33.483
CASES MISLEADING.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.419
BECAUSE IF YOUR BODY DOESN'T

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:38.655
ADJUST THAT IS NOT GOING TO

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:43.961
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:45.329
I'LL START TO TAKE A STAB AT

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:47.297
THIS ONE SO I'M MY NAME IS KAREN

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.665
FISHER AND THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:49.566
THE DOWN BOARD.

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:51.602
WHEN WE SEE QUESTIONABLE

00:47:51.668 --> 00:47:53.370
PRACTICES GOING ON WE DO START

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:54.938
INVESTIGATIONS AND WE WORK

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.273
CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.774
GENERAL'S OFFICE TO DETERMINE

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:58.875
WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY

00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:00.210
VIOLATIONS OF THE DENTAL

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.778
PRACTICE ACT?

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:04.147
SO WE DO ACT PROACTIVELY IN THAT

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:05.549
RESPECT --

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:08.885
BUT WE ALSO OUR COMPLAINT DRIVEN

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:11.021
STEVE COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:12.823
ABOUT TREATMENT PROVIDED BY ANY

00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:14.224
KIND OF A DENTIST WHETHER IT'S A

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.492
PROCESS HONEST OR AN

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:17.828
ORTHODONTIST OR AN ORAL SURGEON

00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:19.496
WE DO INVESTIGATE THOSE

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:20.931
COMPLAINTS FULL FULLY.

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:22.232

EXPERTS TO ASSIST US IN THAT

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:24.901
EFFORT.

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:26.503
SO TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WE

WOULDN'T BE ASKING THIS QUESTION

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:30.274
BUT WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND AND

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.808

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:35.912
DOING THAT --

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:36.947
MY CONCERNED IT WOULD GET TO

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:38.148
KEEP A GOOD EYE ON THAT

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:39.916
ABSOLUTELY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT

LEARN AND AND TO FIND NEW WAYS.

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:48.892

I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION AS MUCH

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:07.878
AS A COMMENT I THINK QUITE OFTEN

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:08.745
WHEN WE HAVE THESE OVERSIGHT

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:09.613
HEARINGS.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.847
THE TENDENCY IS TO FOCUS ON ALL

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:12.816
THE PROBLEM ISSUES AND WE COME

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:13.717
ACROSS THIS KIND OF CRITICAL AND

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.452
SO BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK IT'S

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:16.887
IMPORTANT TO PAUSE AND GIVE YOU

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:18.155
COMPLIMENTS WHEN YOU DESERVE A

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.289
COMPLIMENT.

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:20.857
AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT

00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:23.126

BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE'RE IN

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:27.431
OUR REGULATORY ROLE SOMETIMES WE

00:49:27.497 --> 00:49:29.232
JUST STICK TO ORTHODOXY AND

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:31.368
WE'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE RISKS.

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:32.736

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.008
REFRESHING I CAN COUNT ON ONE

00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:39.309
HAND.

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:40.544

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:41.545

THERE'S NO PUBLIC BENEFIT.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.582
IN HAVING MORE OVERSIGHT AND SO

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:46.683
WE WANT TO SCALE IT BACK WHEN

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.752

AND ALSO THE LICENSURE BY

00:49:53.156 --> 00:49:54.524

DOING IT.

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:00.897

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:47.744
POINT 5% OF DDS --

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:51.882
LICENSEES AND 45% OF THE RDA

00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:58.188
LICENSEES FIELD AUDITS AND SENSE

00:50:58.255 --> 00:50:59.189
OF DIED SO --

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:02.793
CERTAINLY THAT'S VERY CONCERNING --

00:51:02.859 --> 00:51:04.027
CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO HOW YOU

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:06.396
PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SEEMS

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:07.364
TO BE A RATHER HIGH PERCENTAGE

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.332
OF PEOPLE THAT COMPLAIN OF

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:12.135
CONTINUING EDUCATION.

00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:14.337
UL ATTEMPT THIS ONE TOO SO --

00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:16.406
IT THE AUDITS OF THE REGISTERED

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:17.941
DENTAL ASSISTANTS ARE RELATIVELY

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:19.075
NEW.

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:21.445
AND SO UNFORTUNATELY OUR

00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:23.847
RESPONSES THAT IF THEY HAVE

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.315
ESSENTIALLY --

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:27.184
SIGN THE AFFIDAVIT UPON LICENSE

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.618
RENEWAL THAT THEY HAVE THEIR

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:30.720
UNITS ARE REQUIRED UNITS WE

00:51:30.787 --> 00:51:32.189
ISSUE A CITATION SAYING IN

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:33.590
ESSENCE THAT THEY HAVE NOT.

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:35.592
EXPRESSED A TRUTHFUL ANSWER IN

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:36.460
THAT RESPECT.

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:38.161
SO WE'RE WE'RE BEGINNING THE

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:39.963
PROCESS OF MONITORING AND AND

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.465
THE STAFF IS ALSO LOOKING AT

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:43.700
TRANS TO FIND OUT WHERE THE

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.001
PROBLEMS LIE IF PEOPLE ARE

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:46.736
TAKING CONTINUING EDUCATION THAT

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:48.438
THEY DON'T REALIZE IS NOT BOARD

00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:49.840
APPROVED --

00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:52.175
THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TRY TO

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:53.510
DEVELOP --

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:55.979
ESSENTIALLY PERHAPS OF NOTICES

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.347
ARE ADVISORIES THAT SAY WE'RE

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:59.783
FINDING THIS TREND HAPPENING BUT

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.952
WE ARE CONDUCTING THE THE

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:03.186
CONTINUING EDUCATION WE'RE

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:06.523
FINDING THAT A LOT OF DOGS EAT

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.459
THESE CERTIFICATES USE.

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.895
AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE --

00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:13.396
TO EDUCATE PEOPLE AS WE GO ALONG

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.365
BUT WE DO ISSUE CITATIONS FOR

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:16.766
THOSE WHO DO NOT COMPLY WELL

00:52:16.833 --> 00:52:17.868
CERTAINLY IS A LICENSED HEALTH

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:18.635
PROFESSIONAL THE STATE OF

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.070
CALIFORNIA I UNDERSTAND SOME OF

00:52:20.136 --> 00:52:21.705
THE CHALLENGES OF TRACKING YOUR

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:23.206
CD -- THE

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:24.908
OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS IS THAT

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.878
AND AND NOW SINCE IT MAKES NOTE

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.112
THAT -- AND

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:30.413
IT'S MY CLEAR FIGHT THE THE THE

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.548
BOARD.

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:33.250
ACTUALLY REVIEWS AND APPROVES

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.951
SEE COURSES OR NOT I THOUGHT YOU

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:37.053
DIDN'T DO YOU DO YOU DO THAT

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.188
YOURSELF OR DO YOU DIFFER TO USE

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:39.456
AN ACCREDITATION AGENCY.

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:40.557
WHO BASICALLY --

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:41.625
DECIDES.

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:44.794
WHICH SEE IS VALID OR NOT --

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:45.929
FOR PURPOSES OF THE DENTAL BOARD

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:46.696
FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENERAL

00:52:46.763 --> 00:52:48.131
CONTINUING EDUCATION THE BOARD

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:50.133
APPROVES PROVIDERS BUT NOT THE

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.568
INDIVIDUAL COURSES OKAY DO YOU

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:53.670
HAVE TO MANDATORY COURSES

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.472
CURRENTLY FOR THE BOARD ADD TO

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:57.507
OUR INFECTION CONTROL AND THE

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:58.308
DENTAL PRACTICE ACT COURSE.

00:52:58.375 --> 00:52:59.910
THOSE PARTICULAR COURSE CONTENT

00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:01.711
OUTLINES ARE REVIEWED AND

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:02.512
APPROVED INDIVIDUALLY BY THE

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:03.613
BOARD AND THEN THE OTHER

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.881
QUESTION IS IS THAT IS THERE

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:11.922
SOME ENTITY THAT REVIEWS --

00:53:11.988 --> 00:53:15.258
STE C. E. FOR WHEN YOU'RE GOING

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:16.526
TO SEE PROGRAM THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:17.561
CONTINUE EDUCATION IT'S NOT

00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:19.663
MARKETING SESSION TO SELL SOME

00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:20.597
KIND OF PRODUCTS --

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:23.433
THAT THEY WANT THEM PROFESSIONAL.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.167
TO THEN --

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:25.769
PASS ON TO THEIR PATIENTS.

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:27.003
SO IS THERE SOME SORT OF

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.071
CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY THE

00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:29.272
THROUGH THE BOARD ITSELF OR

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:31.808
THROUGH SOME OTHER ENTITIES THAT --

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:33.643
YOU DEPEND ON TO SURE THAT

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.445
THAT'S THAT THE SEEDS

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:37.314
APPROPRIATE IF THE BOARDS MADE

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.316
AWARE OF IN THE SITUATION IT

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:40.483
ISSUE WITH THE PROVIDER THAT WE

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.519
DO THE ANIMAL CONTACT THE

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:43.486
PROVIDER AND DISCUSS THAT WITH

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:45.322
THEM AND RUN AN INVESTIGATION OF

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:46.122
SORTS -- THE

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:48.191
PROVIDERS ARE ALSO REQUIREDTO

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:50.260
PROVIDE A LIST OF THE COURSES

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:51.928
THAT THEY PROVIDED OVER THE PAST

00:53:51.995 --> 00:53:55.999
TWO YEARS AND I WAS ARE AUDITED

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.867
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

00:53:57.934 --> 00:53:59.603
OKAY AND SO JUST TO CLARIFY SO

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:01.638
BASICALLY IS THE BOARD DIRECTLY

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:03.907
THAT HAS TO REVIEW WHETHER TO MY

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:04.874
TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUES.

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:07.677
AND GONNA TO ASK BECAUSE KNOWING

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:08.278
HOW MANY BUT PERCENT OF PEOPLE

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:08.945
YOU THOUGHT IT FOR YOU SEE EASE

00:54:09.012 --> 00:54:10.480
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVIDERS

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:10.981
THEN DO YOU --

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:14.117
I THOUGHT IT TOO SURE THAT THEIR

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.786
ARMED CONFLICT OF INTEREST PAN

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:18.355
FOR THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS I'D

00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:19.556
SAY THAT IT'S VERY LOW --

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:21.024
BUT EVERY SINGLE PROVIDER IS

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.826
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE COURSE

00:54:22.892 --> 00:54:24.461
INFORMATION THAT THEY OKAY ARE

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:25.128
YOU DEPEND ON OUR PLANES ARE YOU

00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:26.830
PRACTICALLY AUDITING TO BE SURE

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:28.465
A SAMPLE TO BE SURE THAT THIS IS

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:30.166
NOT A PROBLEM IN THE SEA.

00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:31.635
AND THE PROFESSION IT'S A

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:33.003
COMBINATION OF BOTH.

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.537
OKAY SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:35.972
WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT YOU

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:37.874
ACTUALLY PRO ACTIVELY AUDIT --

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:39.542
I THINK THAT I WELL I DON'T

00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:40.810
THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:42.412
PROBLEM IN THE DENTAL WORLD

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:44.214
HAVING SOME FAMILIARITY WITH IT --

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.982
A A A NOTE THAT SOME OF THE

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:46.783
OTHER.

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:48.818
SPORTS HAVE COME BEFORE US --

00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:49.886
DOES DOES SEEM TO BE A

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.388
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WHERE

00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:52.722
THERE'S AN ADEQUATE REVIEW IF

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:54.424
THE CONTINUING EDUCATION AND TO

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.092
ENSURE THE MAIN AND SOME BOARDS

00:54:56.159 --> 00:54:57.260
ACTUALLY DO HAVE A CONFLICT OF

00:54:57.327 --> 00:55:01.531
INTEREST POLICY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:02.332
PROVIDING SEE [inaudible]

00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:07.103
YES NOW.

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.004
WE DO NOT HAVE A CAR OKAY I I

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.572
WOULD URGE THAT THE BOARD

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:11.074
CONSIDER THAT --

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:12.709
I THINK IT --

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:14.177
WE NEED TO BE SURE TO THE C. E.

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:15.645
THAT WERE REQUIRING MORE

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:16.680
MANDATING ON HER VARIOUS

00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:18.314
PROFESSIONALS ACTUALLY IS ABOUT

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.816
CONTINUING EDUCATION AND THAT'S

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:21.384
NOT.

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:22.352
THAT -- THE

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:23.586
COURSES THAT THEY TAKE ARE NOT

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.388
ONES THAT ARE ACTUALLY MORE

00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:26.723
DESIGNED --

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.658
TO MARKET --

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:29.259
FOR THE INTEREST OF THE PERSON

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:32.529
WHO'S PRODUCT AND SO FORTH --

00:55:32.595 --> 00:55:33.663
SO THIS IS SOMETHING.

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.031
SO I THINK --

00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:36.433
FOR EXAMPLE THE TRADITION

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:38.902
COUNCIL ON CONTINUING MEDICAL

00:55:38.968 --> 00:55:39.202
EDUCATION --

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:41.171
THAT THE CREDITS --

00:55:41.237 --> 00:55:43.273
LICENSING L. A C. --

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:44.441
FOR CME FOR AND IN THE MEDICAL

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:45.842
PROFESSION HAS CONFLICT OF

00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:47.711
INTEREST POLICIES I THINK SOME

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:49.546
BOARDS DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:50.013
THAT.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.715
OF WORDS WHEN IT COMES TO

00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:52.549
CONTINUE EDUCATION TO HAVE

00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:54.184
CONFLICT INTEREST POLICIES TO

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.052
ENSURE THAT THE REQUIRED

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:58.388
EDUCATION IS NOT IS ACTUALLY IN

00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:00.023
THE INTERESTS OF THE PATIENTS.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.725
AND AND PATIENTS TO BE TAKEN

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:02.959
CARE OF AND NOT IN INTEREST OF

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:07.630
THE PERSON WHO'S TEACHING COURSE

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.099

CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE PROJECTS.

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:43.832
SHOULD ONE OF THE FIVE

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:46.001
ARCHITECTS BE AN EXPERT IN

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:48.403
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IN THE

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.839
CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH PROJECTS.

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:52.341
MAY I ASK FOR ANSWER THE SECOND

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:55.410
PART AND THEN I WILL ASK NATO.

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:56.945
TO ADDRESS THE FIRST PART --

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:59.915
YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING --

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:01.650
I HAPPEN TO BE.

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.685
AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.120
OUR PROTECTIVE AMONGST OTHER

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:07.556
THINGS BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:09.191
HAPPENS [inaudible]

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:10.892
TO BE COINCIDENTAL.

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:13.161
AND NOW WITH THE EMPHASIS ON

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:14.329
AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK IT

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:17.265
IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA AT ALL --

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:18.667
IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:19.968
WOULD CHECK IN WITH THE

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:22.137
APPOINTMENTS OFFICE. TO SAY HERE

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.105
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:24.339
ARCHITECTS THAT WE KNOW AROUND

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:25.640
THE STATE THAT HAVE THE SIX

01:17:25.707 --> 01:17:26.775
EXPERTISE.

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:28.643
AND THEREFORE MAYBE THEY SHOULD

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.078
COME TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE TO

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:31.747
BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE STATE

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:33.081
IN ORDER --

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:34.349
TO PROMOTE.

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:36.084
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING --

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:37.686
AND AND DEAL WITH THE CRISIS

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:38.920
BECAUSE I'M SURE EVERY CITY

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.522
MUNICIPALITIES OUT THERE IT'S

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.024
LIKE TO WORK WITH THE ARCHITECT

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.225
THAT HAVE THE EDUCATION THE FEEL

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:44.359
OF THE EXPERIENCE.

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:46.828
IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.997
THAT'S IMPORTANT AND IF YOU WILL

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:50.999
GO ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION ABOUT.

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:56.104
THE THE UNLICENSED AND I BELIEVE

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:57.406
THAT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS

01:17:57.472 --> 01:17:58.240
THAT WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT

01:17:58.306 --> 01:17:58.774
INCREASE IN LIGHT OF MY

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.509
SELECTIVITY BUT IT IS CERTAINLY

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:01.843
ONE OF THE MAIN --

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.245
COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET IT IS IN

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:04.946
REGARDS ON LICENSE ACTIVITY --

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:06.281
SO WE DO TRY TO DO OUTREACH TO

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:07.449
CONSUMERS SO THEY'RE AWARE OF

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.818
THE REQUIREMENTS AND THERE IS AN

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:10.652
EXEMPTION THE LAW.

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:11.887
FOR A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING BUT

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:13.522
WE TRY TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS AS

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:14.823
TO WHEN AN ARCHITECT IS REQUIRED

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:15.957
BUT THEY SHOULD LOOK FOR IN

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:18.260
CHOOSING AN ARCHITECT --

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:20.228
AND SOMETHING WILL CONTINUE TO

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:20.762
WORK ON AND DO ADDITIONAL

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:21.730
OUTREACH.

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:22.798
THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:33.175
AS ARCHITECTS AND LANDSCAPE

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:34.342
ARCHITECTS.

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:36.378
AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN PROBABLY

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:38.613
AND AT LEAST MY DISTRICT.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.915
ARE EIGHTY A ISSUES.

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:42.651
AND ISSUES WHERE PLANS HAVE BEEN

01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:45.487
SUBMITTED THE BUILDER --

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:46.888
HAS RECEIVED THE PERMIT THE

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:48.323
PLANTS BEEN APPROVED.

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:49.791
THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE ACCORDING

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:53.228
TO SPEC TO FIND OUT THAT.

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:55.030
A WHETHER IT BE MONTHS OR YEARS

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:57.132
LATER A LAWSUIT IS FILED BECAUSE

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:59.768
OF EIGHTY EIGHT VIOLATIONS.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:01.770
AND I KNOW IT IS ADDRESSED --

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:04.639
IN THE MATERIAL HERE WHAT IS --

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:06.808
WHAT IS THE ANSWER WHAT CAN YOU

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:07.843
DO TO HELP --

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:09.311
AFFECTED LEE --

01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:10.579
BRING AWARENESS TO THE

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:13.682
ARCHITECTS AS FAR AS ADA.

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:16.618
COMPLIANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:17.686
PLANS ARE ACCURATE.

01:19:17.752 --> 01:19:20.355
AND THE BUILDERS AND THOSE THAT

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:21.156
ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT PERMIT

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:24.759
AND IN THEIR PROJECT ARE NOT IN

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:25.494
VIOLATION.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:32.434
AND DON'T GET SUED.

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.669
I WAS MARK TRUSCELLO AGAINST

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:36.905
LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT DAY IN THE

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:38.540
PROFESSIONAL WORLD ENGINEERS

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.242
LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS ARCHITECTS

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:42.144
ALL LOOK AT EIGHTY A ISSUES SO

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:45.213
WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY I I THINK

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.681
THAT -- IT'S

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.349
GETTING A LOT BETTER THAN I WAS

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:48.950
SAY THIRTY YEARS AGO IN TERMS OF

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:50.652
ACCESSIBILITY.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:53.622
I WOULD STATE TO THE AND SILICON.

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:54.723
FOLLOW UP ON THIS BUT THE

01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:57.325
ARCHITECTS THEMSELVES GO TO A

01:19:57.392 --> 01:19:59.394
VERY RIGOROUS CAST --

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.229
TRAINING SCENARIO WHERE THEY

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:02.464
HAVE.

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:04.466
TO BE CERTIFIED RIGHT AND YOU

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:05.967
CAN PICK UP ON NOT THAT'S RIGHT

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:07.936
WELL FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.204
GOING TO GET A BUILDING PERMIT.

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.640
UNLESS ALL THE ADA ISSUES ARE

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:12.541
ADDRESSED.

01:20:12.607 --> 01:20:14.676
SO THAT'S THE FIRST LINE OF

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:15.544
DEFENSE.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:17.312
AND MARK MARK IS REFERRING TO IS

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:19.447
THE CAST CERTIFICATION WHICH IS

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:22.584
A VERY HIGH LEVEL SPECIALIZED --

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.986
CERTIFICATION FOR ARCHITECTS WHO

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:27.189
ARE --

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:30.926
EXPERTS REAL EXPERTS BUT I WOULD

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.227
I WOULD REALLY.

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:33.695
PUT MY STICK MY NECK OUT HERE

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:34.796
AND SAY THAT WE CAN'T GET A

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.865
PERMIT -- I

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:38.600
ACTUALLY HAD AN INCIDENT MIGHT

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.001
ONE PROJECT IN MIND WHERE WE

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:41.670
WERE OFF ONE INCH.

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:43.205
IN HEIGHT AND THE BUILDING

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:44.639
INSPECTOR ACTUALLY MANAGED TO

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:47.075
REDO THE FLOORING SO THAT IT

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:48.643
LINED ONE INCH.

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:49.477
SO -- I

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:50.879
THINK THAT WITH KALBA WHICH IS

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:52.747
THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:54.349
BUILDING OFFICIALS WE ARE VERY

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:56.117
COOPERATIVE IS SOMETIMES

01:20:56.184 --> 01:20:59.721
CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:00.689
THEY DO WATCH EVERY INCH.

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:02.057
YEAH SO I'M NOT TOO WORRIED

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:03.158
ABOUT THAT --

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:05.894
IN IN THE SENSE OF OUR APPROVALS

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:07.729
PROCEDURES THAT HAPPENS.

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:09.231
I THINK PRETTY RIGOROUSLY.

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:15.804
OKAY AND I I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:16.438
I ALSO HAVE ONE THING TO THAT.

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:17.906
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS --

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:18.907
ARCHITECTS OF HAD CANOEING

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:21.343
EDUCATION IN ACCESS --

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:22.844
REQUIREMENTS AND EIGHTY EIGHT

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:24.112
AND SO WE WOULD CONTINUE TO SEE

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:26.681
I THINK IMPROVEMENTS WITH --

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:27.449
THE REQUIREMENTS SIMPLY FEEL

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:28.383
RIGHT I THINK THAT WAS THE

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.652
ANSWER I WAS LOOKING --

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:31.786
FOR NOT NO WORRIES BECAUSE OF A

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:33.321
BUILDER INSPECTORS INVOLVED THAT

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.990
MEANS A PERMIT WAS ISSUED.

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:37.259
AT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT --

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:38.460
SO AS FAR AS THE CONTINUING

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:41.096
EDUCATION BECAUSE THERE ARE LAWS

01:21:41.162 --> 01:21:41.696
THAT CHANGE DIFFERENT THINGS

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:42.464
HAPPEN.

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:48.403
AND SO THERE IS PURSUE THEY HAVE --

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.970
TO EVERY TWO YEARS NEED TO

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:50.071
COMPLETE FIVE HOURS AND

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:51.573
DISABILITY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.874
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:54.175

FIRST OF ALL I AGREE WITH YOUR

DECISION NOT TO FINGERPRINT

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:04.919
EVERYONE APPLIES I'M NOT SURE

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:06.588
HOW THAT HELPS --

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.523
THE I DID DEVON BRIEF QUESTION --

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.258
REGARDING BREEZE --

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:11.593
EX I UNDERSTAND THAT --

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.427
IS THAT --

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:14.596
YOU'RE NOT ON BREEZE --

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:16.264

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:18.400
YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT --

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:20.402
SO -- MAYBE

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:21.569
YOU CAN TELL ME DID YOU EVER

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.171
HAVE TO HAVE TO RAISE FEES TO

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:24.739
COVER THIS THING --

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:27.142
THIS --

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:29.944
EXPENSE OR DID YOU BECAUSE YOU

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:32.647
SPEND MONEY HAD TO PROVIDE MONEY

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:34.582
FOR THIS --

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:35.917
PROGRAMS THAT --

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.252
SYSTEM THAT YOU.

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.020
DO NOT MEET YOUR NEEDS.

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:40.021
ARE WE HAVE NOT HAD TO RAISE

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:41.823
FEES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS TO

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:43.491
PAPER BREEZE UP FOR EITHER

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:45.193
PROGRAM -- I

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.361
DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:48.330
THAT WE HAD TO FORGO DOING I'VE

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:48.963
ONLY BEEN WITH THE BOARD SINCE

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:50.598
LAST YEAR AS INDICATED --

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:51.666
SO I'M NOT AWARE THAT THERE'S

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:53.234
ANY LARGE PROJECT THAT WE HAD TO

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:54.703
FORGO AT THIS POINT --

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:56.538
SO WE ARE AT ONE OF THE PHASE

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:57.372
THREE PROGRAM SO WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:58.573
UNDERGOING OUR BUSINESS

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.941
MODERNIZATION PROCESS AND

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:00.709
COMPLETING OUR MAPPING TO

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:01.276
DETERMINE WHAT MIGHT COME

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:02.477
FORWARD.

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:03.712
SO WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:04.312
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COSTS

02:38:39.276 --> 02:38:40.344
THOUSAND IS REALLY --

02:38:40.410 --> 02:38:42.279
DISAPPOINTING AND TROUBLESOME

02:38:42.346 --> 02:38:43.480
THAT WE HAVE SO MANY LOW INCOME

02:38:43.547 --> 02:38:44.815

02:38:50.888 --> 02:38:52.089
BEEN UNABLE TO DO THAT WE MADE

02:38:52.155 --> 02:38:53.490
EFFORTS LAST YEAR TO GET SOME

02:38:53.557 --> 02:38:54.625
MONEY IN THE BUDGET. TO

02:38:54.691 --> 02:38:56.293
SUPPLEMENT --

02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.728
THE TERROR HALF OF THAT DIDN'T

02:38:57.794 --> 02:39:00.364
HAPPEN --

02:39:00.430 --> 02:39:03.200

THE JAMISON DECISION UNDERSCORES

02:39:23.287 --> 02:39:24.922
