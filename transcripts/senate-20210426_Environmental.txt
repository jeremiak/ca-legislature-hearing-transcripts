INDUSTRIAL USE IT'S NOT CLEAN TO THE SAME GRADE AS HOUSING AND IN ONE. OF THE PUBLIC TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND THE SAME ON THE OTHER WITNESS ABOUT THE RISK OF WORKERS ON THE JOB SITE THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE SEEK REVIEW THAT'S AN OSHA WANTS TO REVIEW HAS BEEN GONE AND IDENTIFIED WHAT. THE YOU KNOW SO A CHILL LOGICAL IN SOIL THINGS ARE SO WITH THAT I WILL MOVE- THE MEASURE AND THE HAVE. REMEMBER BEING LOST WHEN YOUR DAD PASSED THIS BILL SO. FINISHER DOLLY. THANK YOU THERE ARE CHAIR SO- I LIKE YOUR BILL BUT I DO HAVE A COKE I DO HAVE A QUESTION THAT THE COMMONSENSE RULE I ACTUALLY CAME IN IT WAS A CASE OF VISOR FOR A LONG TIME AND WE HAD. THE OPPORTUNITY USE THIS TO WHAT WE HAVE IN MANY THE RULE CARRIES ALMOST TALK ABOUT THE REALLY SMALL COUNTIES ARE TRYING TO CLEAN UP- TELESIS CITY UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS I KNOW THERE'S A- POT OF MONEY THAT. IS AVAILABLE FOR THAT FOR EVEN THOSE PROPERTIES THAT. NOBODY OWNS BASICALLY THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN PUT IN THE SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CLEAN THOSE UP AND SO THAT. THE BILL THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS TO ALLOW THAT COMMON SENSE TO SAY HEY. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE WORK FOR THE COST OF. WE HAVE NOT HAVE TO DO SO MUCH ENVIRONMENTAL WORK ACTUALLY GETS MORE WORK DONE AND THAT WAS THE REASON THAT THERE WAS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO IT RIGHT THAT KATE. WOULD NOT DISPENSED MUCH MONEY ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WE CAN JUST GO CLEAN IT UP. SO IS THERE IS THERE. I WOULD I WOULD READ THROUGH EVERYTHING I HAD AVAILABLE TO ME- I'M ASSUMING A LOT OF THOSE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE WAY NOW AND WE'VE DONE. A LOT OF WORK ON THOSE OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. SOMETIME IS THERE IS A TWO SIX ON LIKE HOW MUCH IS LEFT OUT THERE THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT PRETTY MUCH MOST COUNTIES KNOW WHERE THEY HAVE BROWN FIELDS. WHERE THEY HAVE. YOU KNOW THERE WAS SOME BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT NOW THE LAWS CHANGE AND IT'S BECAME TOXIC THAT THEY WERE AWARE BEFORE SO DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT BECAUSE- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. LEAVING SITES THAT WE COULD GO CLEAN UP. IN THERE WAS THAT COST DIFFERENTIAL IN THEIR. THANK YOU FOR. NOT SURE WHERE WE GO THANK YOU THOSE ARE EXCELLENT POINTS THE- THE ORIGINAL BILL. WAS REALLY SET OUT TO IDENTIFY SOMETHING HAD NEVER BEEN IDENTIFIED BEFORE WHICH IS WHERE OUR THEIR UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE LEAKING TO STE WHERE ARE THEY- SUPPOSED TO THE NEED TO BE. MAPPED AND IDENTIFIED THUS THE NAME LIST OR THE TURN LIST RIGHTS OF THIS LISTING WHAT'S THE LISTING CAME OF COURSE- THEN THE WHOLE INDUSTRY DEVELOPED IN- STATE FUNDING. CAME ABOUT TO ASSIST IN CLEANING UP ANY OF THOSE AT IN FACT HAD BEEN LEAKING- THAT PROCESS GOES ON I DON'T KNOW PRECISELY HOW MANY REMAIN HOW MANY HAVE BEEN CLOSE OVER THE YEARS BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT A GOOD WORK HAS BEEN DONE. HOW MANY WOULD REMAIN OPEN TO THIS DAY WE WOULD PROBABLY DEPEND PART ON HOW HOW RECENTLY THEY WERE DISCOVERED IN ADDED TO THE LIST- THAT SAID- THE ISSUE ERE IS THAT IT'S SORT OF A- IT'S SORT OF A- THERE'S LESS. LOOPHOLE IF YOU WILL I'M NOT SURE IF YOU KNOW IT IT'S AT ALL OF FAIR LOOPHOLE BUT- WHERE- THE COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION WHICH REALLY ISN'T ABOUT COMMON SENSE IN THE LATE LAYPERSON'S TERMS ABOUT TO TELL THEM APART THAT SAYS WHEN THERE'S NO FURTHER POSSIBILITY. OF IN THIS CASE CONTAMINATION THEN GO AHEAD AND CLOSE AT A LOCAL AGENCY CAN CLOSE IT- THAT IS EXTRAORDINARILY- IN CONTRADICTION. TO DTS SEE SITTING ON THAT SITE ST THERE STILL IS. HAZARDOUS WASTE ON THE SITE THAT'S WHY WE HAVEN'T CLOSED SO IF THE TNC IS SAYING WE HAVE NOTYET- DEAN THIS. SITE READY FOR CLOSURE BECAUSE OF THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS UNDERGROUND. BUT A LOCAL AGENCY SHOULD BE COMING ALONG. OVERRIDING ON THE BASIS THAT THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SO. THIS IS JUST TRYING TO. STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING DOES A REMOTE REQUIRE OF COURSE THAT IS A FULL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BE DONE THAT'S AS WE ALL KNOW FROM OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT DAYS- AND A SIMPLE NEGATIVE DECLARATION COULD. COULD BE USED BUT AT LEAST YOU STILL HAVE YOU THEN HELP THE PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS PEOPLE WERE NOTIFIED ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO SUPPORT COULD TESTIFY. THIS THIS COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION IS ESSENTIALLY HE BATES ALL OF THAT THERE'S NO PUBLIC INPUT THERE'S NO PUBLIC PROCESS IT IS THE DETERMINATION. SO WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING I DO THINK IN THE FUTURE- SO LEGISLATION PROBABLY SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THE CLOSURE OF THOSE SITES THAT HAVE BEEN HANGING AROUND. THAT ARE AS CLEAN AS ARE GOING TO GET- A ADDITION BE. BY. I AM TRYING TO GET A NICE WAY TO SAY APPLE PIE. MESSING WITH- THE- THE PROCESS IN A BACK HANDED WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE BY LEGISLATING PERHAPS WHAT THE NEW STANDARDS ARE IN TERMS OF CLOSURE. THIS BILL DOESN'T ATTEMPT TO DO THAT STEP ONE IS CLOSE A LOOPHOLE. WELL I PURSUED THAT AND I WILL I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO GO IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I JUST DON'T WANT TO. GET THAT CATCH TWENTY TWO WHERE YOU HAVE AND IT'S NOT JUST UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS ITS INDUSTRIAL BRETT WE HAVE. A LOT IN THE RULERS WE HAVE YOU KNOW OLD LUMBER MILL SITES THAT NOBODY AND BASICALLY THEY JUST WALKED AWAY FROM A LONG LONG TIME AGO AND THEN THE COUNTY STOCK BUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A CAN WE REPURPOSE AS WHAT CAN WE DO WITH IT. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T. WE DON'T. PUSH THEM OUT WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEIR NAME BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT. WE KNOW WHAT'S THERE. I MEAN AND WE WHEN WE ALSO THE THING IS WE MAJOR. IN PARTS PER BILLION AND WE USED TO DO PARTS PER MILLION SO USE. IT THOSE THOSE THINGS THOSE LITTLE NUMBERS MAKE UP A LOT OF DIFFERENCES WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A SITE. BACK INTO USE OR MAYBE MAYBE SOME OF THOSE PROPERTIES ARE PRIME PROPERTIES BUT THEY JUST HAVE. SOME OF THOSE ARE SO I'M I'M I'M- I'M- THE BILL COMING FORWARD. A AND I JUST WANT TO HOPE THAT YOU KNOW IT ACTUALLY DOES WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOT- PUT IT WHERE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET SOMETHING DONE WHERE SHOULD MAKE SENSE OF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. THE ANNOUNCED MADAM SECRETARY WILL YOU CALL THE ROLL I'M SORRY SENATOR CORTESE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IT ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE A CLOSE BUT DO A FORMAL ONE YES IT I JUST WANT TO THANK- AGAIN THANK YOU FROM THE CHAIR THANK THE COMMITTEE- THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD QUESTIONS- IT'LL BE MORE WORK TO DO AFTER WE CLOSE A SIMPLE AND I'M COMMITTED TO BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION ON THAT THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THE BILL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM NUMBER ONE SB THIRTY SEVEN BY SENATOR CORTESE THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALAN BATES HI H. I. DALLI DALLI I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ HI SKINNER. STERN TURN ON KERN HIGH MAKOWSKI LCI. THERE ARE TWO BILL HOUSE FIVE VOTES WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN- FOR THE LATE COMERS. THANK YOU AND NOW YOU CAN MOVE TO YOUR NEXT FIELD SENATOR PURCHASING WHICH IS SB FOUR SEVENTY FIVE. JULY TWO BEGAN. YES THANK YOU AGAIN- MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS SP FOUR SEVENTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD CARD TO ADOPT NEW GUIDELINES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES. TO IDENTIFY NEAR TERM BEST PRACTICES FOR REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR HOW TO INTEGRATE CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND SOCIAL EQUITY IN THE PLANS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE- NPOS MATCH POINT PLAYING ORGANIZATIONS IN EACH REGION TO IDENTIFY IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS TO ACHIEVE NEAR TERM GHG REDUCTIONS TARGETS SET BY CARB. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE US THE STEINBERG BILL AIM TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. BY REQUIRING THE SAME REGIONAL NPOS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT LAND USE STRATEGIES AND PRIORITIZE TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS THAT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES IN LONG RANGE PLANS KNOWN AS SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES SCS FOR SHORT. THE HOPE OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE OR SEVENTY BY REQUIRING NPOS TO DOT PLANS THE CHIEF LONG TERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS DIFFERENT LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT DECISIONS WOULD ULTIMATELY BE MADE RESULTING IN CHANGES. IN TRAVEL BEHAVIOR THAT WOULD DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS PARTICULARLY FROM TAIL PIPES FROM PASSENGER VEHICLES ESPECIALLY. UNFORTUNATELY CHANGES IN LAND USE CONTROL BEHAVIOR HAVE NOT OCCURRED AS QUICKLY AS MANY HOPED THE GREATEST A GREATER FOCUS ON NEAR TERM ACTION IS NEEDED. ADDITIONALLY SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE SINGLE FOCUS ON GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION CREATES CHALLENGES FOR LOCAL REGIONAL AGENCY SEEKING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON OTHER IMPORTANT STATE GOALS SUCH AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING CLIMATE RESILIENCE. CREATING TENSION WITH OTHER STATE LAWS. THE REALITY IS THE TYPES OF LAND USE POLICIES THAT MIGHT BE CRITICAL TO PROTECTING THE COMMUNITY FROM CLIMATE RISK. AVOIDING ECONOMIC DISPLACEMENT ARE NOT ALWAYS ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF MINIMIZE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STATE LAW NEEDS TO PROVIDE GREATER GUIDANCE AS TO. HOW A REGIONAL MATCH PALM PRINT PLANNING ORGANIZATION SHOULD APPROACH THESE DIFFICULT TRADE OFFS AND IDENTIFY WIN WIN SOLUTIONS. SB FOUR SEVENTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE CARP TO FORM A STATE REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE FOR CLIMATE EQUITY AND RESILIENCE. TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES AND QUANTIFY THE CLIENT BENEFITS OF COMMON STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE LONG RANGE GHG REDUCTION TARGETS AND RECOMMEND GUIDOLIN GUIDELINES FOR NPOS. TO INTEGRATE STATE GOALS RELATED TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND SOCIAL EQUITY INTO THEIR S. YES.THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE STATE ENERGY RESOURCE CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. TO SET REGIONAL BUILDING DECARBONIZATION TARGETS. FOR TWENTY THIRTY IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S TARGETS FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND AUTHORIZE NPOS TO DEVELOP AN ADDENDUM TO THE SCS. THAT ENUMERATES LOCAL BUILDING TO CARBONIZATION POLICIES. IT PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. UP IN THIS IS A CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT CROSSES POINT AS BEFORE SEVENTY FIVE WILL BE SENT TO SENATE TRANSPORTATION- BUT MY INTENT THERE IS HOLD THE MEASURE AS A TO YOUR BILL. THE END A COMMIT TO WORKING WITH SURE ALAN ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY HOUSING TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEES ON A CLAVICLE COLLABORATIVE PATH FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE. APPEAR TO TESTIFY PROVIDE- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF ANY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IS REBEKAH ALONG WITH THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WHICH IS THE MPO FROM THE BAY AREA- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EYEBALLS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR A MISS LONG IS SLIGHT LEAD WITNESS- MODERATOR DO HAVE MISS LONG ON.

THIS LANDMARK LAW WITH NOTEWORTHY FOR LINKING OUR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING FUNDING AND AND USE DECISIONS TO THE STATE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. AND KEEPING WITH THE COURT OF THE LAW AT THE TIME AND HEAVILY INVOLVED IN PASSAGE UNFORTUNATELY AS A R. B. TO. SACRAMENTO INTERACTING WITH IF YOU WERE TWENTY H. EIGHTEEN SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IT'S. FALLING SHORT OF GOLD ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS. ALTHOUGH PLANS MEETING G. H. REDUCTION TARGETS ON PAPER. IN THE REAL WORLD TRY ARE MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION WHAT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED HER PERSON GROWING. RATHER THAN FLOWING. AT BEFORE SEVENTY FIVE AIMS TO ADDRESS THAT BY FOCUSING ON NEAR TERM ADMINISTRATION OF PROJECTS AND POLICIES. WITH A PROVEN RECORD OF REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. RATHER THAN THE CURRENT APPROACH WHICH IS OVERLY FOCUSED ON ACHIEVING A MAGIC NUMBER IN A LONG TERM TRANSPORTATION MODEL. CRITICALLY BEFORE SEVENTY FIVE WILL REQUIRE REGIONAL AGENCIES LIKE MINE. YOU IDENTIFIED NEAR TERM ACTIONS THEY WILL TAKE TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIES THAT ARE PROVEN TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS. AND THEN HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACTION. FINALLY AND BEFORE SEVENTY FIVE TAKES THE CRITICAL STEP IN INTEGRATING SOCIAL EQUITY AND CLIMATE RESILIENT AND THE OTHER. IN THE AREA TWENTY FIFTY ARE CURRENTAS THE US UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN TO EXPAND PROSPERITY FOR ALL BAY AREA RESIDENTS AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITY MORE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF THE CLIMBING. A CHANGING CLIMATE THAT THREATENS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND BUSINESSES YOU CAN SEE LEVEL RIGHTS AND WILDFIRES. WELL WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TACKLE THAT IN OUR DRAFT PLAN CURRENT LAW PROVIDES CONFLICTING DIRECTION AND INSUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY HOW TO APPROACH TRADEOFFS ACROSS THESE MULTIPLE IMPORTANT GOAL.

BECAUSE AS OF NOW THE BILL IS THIS ONLY TRYING TO GO IN- IN THOSE AREAS WERE SES'S ARE ARE BEING DEVELOPED BY- BY HIM PEELS ARE BY REGIONAL ENTITIES- DIED IN. HERE TRYING TO BRING IN IN THESE OTHER ELEMENTS- WE HAVE WORK TO DO THAT'S WHY A WILL WILL SORT OF HOPSCOTCH HERE TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET OF INTO COLLABORATIVE MODE IN TERMS OF THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE A LOT OF THIS WORK IN THE PAST HAS BEEN TRANSPORTATION BUT MEANWHILE WE GOT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR EXAMPLE. MAYBE NOT YOUR COUNTY CERTAINLY MY COUNTY SOME WHITE AND SOME OTHER COUNTIES ADOPT. OF REACH CLOSER DECARBONIZATION POLICIES WHICH UP SEPARATE LEGISLATION IS ASKING THEM TO PUT INTO THEIR THEIR LOCAL GENERAL PLANNED SO THAT THESE REGIONAL ENTITIES THAT ARE DOING THESE SES'S CONCEDE THAT INCLUDED- THE BENEFIT OF ANY GHG REDUCTION FROM THESE OTHER ACTIVITIES LIKE BUILDING- BUILDING REDUCTIONS BUILDING GHG REDUCTIONS SO. IT'S- WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK ALONG THE WAY YOU KNOW FOR DIRT DURING THIS COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES TO. AS TO HOW TO GET THIS KNITTED TOGETHER UP AND DOWN THE STATE BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE. ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS WHERE THEY DON'T CURRENTLY EXIST- IN IN GEOGRAPHICALLY OR IN GOVERNANCE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THEY DON'T CURRENTLY EXIST IT'S TRYING TO BUILD OFF OF THREE SEVENTY FIVE NOT. FOR IT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH. THREE SEVENTY FIVE IF. IT IF YOU AN AREA WHERE HAVE LIKE. A COG RIGHT IN YOU. AND IN IT WORKS THERE BUT THREE SEVENTY FIVE WAS A STATEWIDE LAW THAT DIDN'T REALLY EXIST VERY MANY SO LOT OF COMMITTEES THAT THIRD LOOK FOR SOMEWHERE IN SOME COMMUNITIES ARE JUST NO WAY AROUND GETTING AWAY FROM TRAVELING YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL A FEW. TO GET THE COMMUNITY OR IT IS THERE'S NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THERE'S NO. REGIONAL GOVERNMENT QUITE FRANKLY THERE'S THEIR SMALL COMMUNITIES IN THREE SEVENTY FIVE WAS IT WAS IT WAS A BATTLE TO YOU TO DO YOUR YOUR GENERAL PLANS. AND MEET THE CRITERIA THREE SEVENTY FIVE BECAUSE THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL REALLY DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK FOR. LOT OF CALIFORNIA A LOT OF THE VERY WIDE OPEN RULE PLACES IT REALLY DOESN'T WORK IT MAKES SENSE TO DO IT. IN PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE. CITIES COUNTIES AD IN AND TRANSPORTATION THAT THEY ALL NEED TO TALK AND THAT AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LIKE I REPRESENT. SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHICH HAS A COG BUT I ALSO REPRESENT SISKIYOU COUNTY THAT HAS. A TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION BUT DOESN'T HAVE. A REGIONAL GOVERNMENT I MEAN THAT THAT THAT HAS TO COORDINATE WITH ALL THESE OTHER- PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. TYPE THING SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CONCERN BECAUSE ONE THREE SEVEN I WAS ACTUALLY. REMEMBER THREE SEVENTY FIVE IS A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THEN AND- AND WE HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT WE DID OUR GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS IN OUR COUNTY REALLY DIDN'T DIDN'T FIT INTO OUR COUNTY DIDN'T MAKE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE OUT THERE TO YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE THE GOALS. ON YOUR BUILDING PLANS- THAT WERE SET IN A THREE SEVENTY FIVE. SO THAT'S WHAT I AM I AM I KNOW THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS FROM WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY- SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT ON TRANSPORTATION AS WELL BECAUSE- IT IS A CHALLENGE TO ME DAD AND THERE'S JUST NO POSSIBLE WAY TO GET THERE SOMETIME SO. I'M A LAYOFF THE BILL MY ONE WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT BUT I DEFINITELY WANT TO BE ENGAGED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- NO DO RIGHT FOR THE AREAS THAT WHAT MAKES SENSE IN AREAS THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE WE GET THESE CLOSE WE CAN. BUT THE ALLOW THEM SOME EXEMPTIONS- THANK YOU CENTER FLOOR I'M A COLLABORATOR AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR ENGAGEMENT GOING FORWARD SO WE CAN GET IT RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OF SENATOR MCCASKILL MOVE THE BILL JUST A QUICK COMMENT SENATOR CORTESE ACTUALLY I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS A GOOD DIRECTION MY CONCERN IS ALWAYS GIVING MORE POWER TO A R. B. THAT COULD N FACT FIND OF SOME OF THE REGIONAL STRATEGIES PRESENTED BY OUR NPOS TO BE NOT IN% COMPLIANCE AND THEN IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO GET THE FUNDS THEY NEED TO DO THE VERY THING. HE WANTING THEM TO DO HERE- WHAT I'M GONNA DO I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY BECAUSE IT COMES A TRANSPORTATION AND I KNOW BETWEEN NOW AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON IT THEY THINK IT'S A STRONG STATEMENT YOU PUT THOSE THE RIGHT DIRECTION REGARDING THIS- THIS INCREASE THIS HOUSING DENSIFICATION THAT SEEMS TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE PRIORITY LIST AND IT DOESN'T FIT NECESSARILY WITH WHAT. A. R. B. MIGHT BE REQUIRING US SO WE'VE GOT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CONFLICTS WITH OUR NPOS TRYING TO DO BOTH THINGS. SO THAT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE DISCUSSION AND WE'LL SEE WHERE I CAN BE AN TRANSPORTATION BUT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE THE VOTES TODAY SO. TO HELP YOU OUT HELP YOU GET OUT OF HERE OKAY.

OKAY WELL LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND- THIS IS READ A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I THINK YOU'RE HEARING THAT REFLECTED IN SO MANY OF THE COMMENTS INCLUDING THE OPPOSITION- AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD HERE IS THAT WE'VE GOT OPPONENTS. OF THE BILL WHO FEEL AS THOUGH IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN OTHERS THINGS GOES TOO FAR SO THAT'S ALWAYS THE TRICK HERE- BUT I WILL HAVE MORE COMMENTS TO MAKE ABOUT THE BILL IN ITS PROCEEDS PROGRESS SO FAR BUT LET'S START WITH THEM WITH THE SENATE ALLEN- BUT AS AN ADULT. WELL I WOULD FIRST. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. TO BE ALWAYS TAKE ON THE TOUGH STUFF IT SEEMS LIKE. AND YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS IN THE SIMPLY I WAS ON THE WORKING GROUP WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND- IN. MY LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE LAST CALLERS ON IT NOT NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HELP THE COUNTIES ET WHERE THEY'RE GOING IN THE- JURISDICTIONS- AND THEN. IN OUR DISTRICT. I MEAN WE JUST DID- SEVEN ONE ASSEMBLY WOMAN DOLLY JUST DID A TOUR TO SISKIYOU COUNTY WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD AND- INVITED THE- RESOURCES PEOPLE AND DGSE TO SEE THE THOUSANDS. AND THOUSANDS OF GROWS THAT ARE ILLEGAL THAT WE ARE IN AN INUNDATED WITH. TRAGIC SITUATION AND TO TRY TO GET THAT RECTIFIED IN THE LICENSING PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE ON LICENSE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ROGUE OUT THERE IS. I DON'T KNOW SIX YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO. ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS YOU YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS AND YOU DO YOU GET TO CONTINUE ON TO OPERATE. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE THE- FOLKS WHO ARE BEEN WAITING FOR THEIR LICENSE WHO ARE TRYING TO LEGITIMATELY BRING. ANY ILLEGAL PROCESS INTO A LEGAL PROCESS FOR THE FOR FOREVER. SO I DON'T I GUESS I'M CHANGES JUST AS RUSTRATED AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE- SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON LIKE GETTING. THE LICENSE IS DONE IN A MORE. EFFICIENT MANNER IS IT WOULD THAT BE HELPING THE COUNTIES OR THE CITIES WITH RESOURCES. I MEAN YOU HEARD THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE SUPERVISOR MISTER WILLIAMS FROM MENDOCINO WHO SAID THEY HAD FOUR PEOPLE ONLY NEED A HUNDRED. WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK HERE AGAIN AND THERE AND THERE'S- LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE JUST SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT THE HECK WITH I I'M JUST GONNA GO OUT THERE. AND MAYBE PAY THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS UP FRONT TODAY AFTER I THINK IT WAS FIVE THOUSAND FOR REMEMBER CORRECTLY FOR THE PERMIT TO GET STARTED. AND THEN JUST. NEVER GO TO THE COUNTY. SO WIDE I GUESS I'M JUST FRUSTRATED AND- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A SOLUTION. TO THE PROBLEM BECAUSE- IT JUST CONTINUES TO GO ON WE DON'T SEEM TO COME UP WITH A- BETTER WAY OF GETTING IT MORE EFFICIENTLY DONE. OKAY CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATOR CARRIER AS WELL I THINK MY I'M ALIGNING MY COMMENTS WITH SENATOR DOLLY AS WELL AND JUST- YOU KNOW THE LOCALS THAT NEED MORE TIME AND SO CAN YOU RESPOND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT THE SIX YEARS IN THE SIX MONTHS AND IF THERE'S YOU KNOW ANY ROOM THERE FOR- DISCUSSION ON ON EITHER. BUT LET ME JUST MAKE- THE VERY CLEAR- THE BILL WAS AMENDED IN RESPONSE TO SOME COMMITTEE- COMMITTEE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN SO- IT SHORTENED THE PERIOD OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR A PROVISIONAL LICENSE TO ONE YEAR IT'S AN EXTRA SIX MONTHS BUT IT'S WHEN YOU'RE FROM THIS JULY- SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE- THE OPPOSITION- FROM THE ORIGINS COUNCIL AND FROM THE- UNITED KEPT CANNABIS ASSOCIATION. UP TO GET TO THE ISSUE THAT- SENATOR DOLLY RAISED UP HERE HERE'S THE CHALLENGE IS THAT- I THINK THE SUPERVISOR OUTLINED IT THE BEST THAT I'VE EVER HEARD WHICH IS THAT THE LEAD AGENCY IS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE WAY THIS THAT THAT THAT THE LEGALIZATION PROCESS WAS SET UP IT PUT IT IN THE LAPS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF GROWS DO YOU WANT TO HAVE WHAT KIND OF FACILITIES YOU WANT TO HAVE OPEN WHAT KIND OF MANUFACTURING- YOU SHOULD DO IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND SO- SO THE CHALLENGES IS THAT WE THROUGH THIS. YOU KNOW YOU HEARD MENDOCINO COUNTY A THOUSAND APPLICATIONS INTO THEIR LAP AND SAID OKAY NOW DO SEQUEL ON ALL OF THIS THE CHALLENGES IS THERE'S PROBABLY SOME SOME ACTIVITY. LIKE THE- THE RETAIL THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE A FULL SECRET WHERE YOU CAN DO A VERY MUCH LIKE ALCOHOL OUTLETS YOU CAN DECIDE THROUGH AN ORDINANCE WHERE YOU WANT THOSE TO GO BUT WE'VE PUT SEQUEL ON EVERYTHING IN THIS BILL DOESN'T TOUCH SEQUEL I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THAT I YOU KNOW WHAT SICK WAS GREAT AND IT TELLS US WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH. WITH THE RULES TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. IF WE COULD PROBABLY GET THERE IN FOUR YEARS BUT WE HAVE TO PUMP A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY INTO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WE'D ALSO HAVE TO PUMP MONEY INTO OUR OWN BECAUSE IS FISHING GAME ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO OUT IN OTHER WORDS- THOUSAND APPLICATIONS HAVE TO GET REVIEWED AND IF THEY DON'T GET THROUGH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCESS AND THEN OVER TO OUR- STATE PROCESSES THEN WE NEED TO FIND. THE LEGALIZATION AND PUT RESOURCES INTO IT AND MAYBE THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO TAKE THE TAX REVENUE IN THE SAME IS DEDICATED TO THIS- BUT WE BUT THERE'S NO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT THAT IT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE MONEY THIS THIS IS JUST GOING TO TAKE TIME. AND THEN ASSUMING. THAT WE PUMPED A LOT OF MONEY INTO IT. WE NEED WE'RE GONNA NEED THE THIS THE SEQUEL EXPERTS CAN WRITE THE REPORTS TOO SO. IT IS A IT'S A NOT A PROBLEM. WITH THIS ONE JUST. GIVING US SOME MORE TIME WAS WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER COPIER AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS I ABSOLUTELY AT THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY THIRTY DOLLARS. WHAT IS HAVE A FALL BACK HAVE A QUESTION THIS TIME SO I'M A FARMER. WE THIS ISN'T THIS IS ACT THIS IS AGRICULTURE ME I KNOW YOU REPRESENT A DISTRICT WHAT. WHAT I WANT TO GROW WHATEVER I WANT TO GO I DON'T HAVE TO DO SECRET WHY CAN'T WE JUST GOING TO THE REGIONAL LIKE. FARM RULES I KNOW THERE I KNOW THAT THERE'S PROCESS SEEING IN THAT BUT FOR THE FOR THE ACTUAL GROW PART OF IT THAT THEY HAVE TO BE DO THE SAME THING THAT EVERY OTHER AGRICULTURE. COMMUNITY WOULD DO. IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THE LOCAL UP THERE DOING SEQUEL. BUT I DON'T HAVE TO DO SECRETIVE. TO GROW. THE THINGS I'M GROWING WHAT WHAT WHAT WHERE'S THE DISCONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT AGRICULTURE DOES AND WHAT CANNABIS IS DOING. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION THE CHALLENGES IS THIS IS WHAT WAS SET UP IN THE- IN THE ORIGINAL- BALLOT MEASURE THAT WAS PASSED. AND SO AND SO IT WAS PART OF THAT PART OF THE PROCESS IS THAT WE GET IN ANALYSIS AND PARTIALLY I BELIEVE. BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING THE E. LOCAL GROWS WERE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT HAD NO REGARD FOR GOOD GOOD FARMING PRACTICES THEY WEREN'T. NECESSARILY WELL IT WAS IN A LEGAL PRODUCT SO THEY DID IT WHEREVER THEY COULD DO IT ADD UP ALTERED STREAM BEDS. DID YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF PESTICIDES APPLICATION AND SOIL MEANT AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WERE GOOD. I THINK THAT'S A CHALLENGE WELL I'M I'M TELLING YOU THAT THAT'S HAPPENING ON STEROIDS IN MOST OF MY DISTRICT. THE NORMAL FARMER THIS DOWNSTREAM FROM WHOSE LOSSES WATER IT'S GETTING CONTAMINATED THEY'RE KILLING FISH IS HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE EVERY TIME HE DOES SOMETHING FOR DIVERSION. GOING AFTER HIM AND THE POT GROWER UP STRICTER WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CIVIL WAR OUT THERE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH SOME BETTER PROCESS. THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW BECAUSE THE ILLEGAL PEOPLE ARE. JUST RUNNING RAMPANT AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO FORM LEGALLY ARE GETTING HAMMERED BY DF THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE IN UNIT FOR A WATER QUALITY AND ALL THOSE THINGS SO. WHAT WE NEED TO GET IT UNDER THE GUISE AYE AYE GIVE SUMMIT COULD I CAN LOOK AT PROP FIFTY FOUR OR SIXTY FOUR WHICH OF WHICH NINE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S. ACTUALLY SAID BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME. WE SHOULD ALLOW IT. IT TO BE FARM ANY OTHER COMMODITIES FORMED. AND REGULATED THE SAME AS WELL EXCEPT FOR THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE OF IT WHICH WOULD THEN WOULD BE. SOMETHING LIKE WE HAVE WITH A. B. C. WITH ALCOHOL ON THE IN THE- RETAIL SPACE. YEAH BT LET ME LET ME JUST DEGREE WITH THE SENATOR YOU KNOW THE UFC RIGHT THIS IS SET OUT IN SIXTY FOUR. I THINK WAS DONE IN A TIME WHEN THE A THIS WAS A BITTERLY BRAND NEW INDUSTRY WAS STILL ILLEGAL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO DO A DEEP DIVE INTO THIS SPACE AND DECIDE WHAT KINDS OF CANNABIS RELATED PROJECTS. MERIT C. CORE VIEW AND WENT DOWN I MEAN THERE'S A LOT A LITTLE POT SHOPS THAT JUST OPENED UP- FOR YOU TO SMALL SMALL OPERATIONS THAT ARE JUST DON'T. REALLY SHOULD BE SUBSEA QUEST. ARE YOU BROUGHT UP SOME GREAT CONCERNS THE OTHER COURSE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE IS THAT THE REALLY BAD ACTORS. ARE TYPICALLY UNDER THE UNDER THE RADAR THE OPERATING UNDERGROUND AND NOT COMPLYING WITH THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. I MEAN IT IS ONE OF THE YEAH WE'VE DELVED INTO THIS ISSUE WHICH IS NOT IN A- POLICY EXPERTISE FOR ME BUT- IN THE- CONTEXT OF THIS BILL- YOU YOU REALLY GET INTO SOME. DIFFICULT PUBLIC POLICY. CONUNDRUM AS YOU TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PUT A REGULATORY SYSTEM IN PLACE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO- ENCOURAGED THE BEST BEHAVIOR AND NOT. AND NOT PUSH PEOPLE ON THE GROUND I THINK YOU HEARD THAT WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE A LITTLE EARLIER I KNOW THIS IS THE ISSUE WE HAVE WITH TAXATION AND JUST THAT THE- THE BLACK MARKET IN THIS IN THIS AREA IN GENERAL SO- THIS IS A- THIS IS A BILL THAT IS GOOD. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY HILL FOR CAN PROGRESS I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR WITH DAD. YEAH CLAIMED THE BUSINESS BAKED AT THIS POINT. YOU KNOW. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT. FOLKS WHO ARE PRESERVING THIS CONVERSATION LABOR. ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY- SMALL GROWERS BIG GROWERS- SMALL AND LARGE- RETAIL. OUR CITIES BREAK IS A LOT OF CITIES HAVE NOW COME UP WITH THEIR OWN. FIVE REGULATORY AS A PROVISIONAL LICENSE SYSTEMS AND SOME OF THEM ONCE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO SEEK THOSE LICENSES PLAY OUT- YOU KNOW I WOULD SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TO DATE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AUTHOR IS VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND TO SEE IF WE CAN AND CAN'T- COME UP ITH SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE LOGICAL BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THINKS OF THIS BILL IS- READY TO. TO MOVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AT THIS POINT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. AND EVEN. AS A LOT OF WORK BEYOND THIS BILL- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS I HEAR FROM SOME OF THE OPPONENTS IS THAT WELL LET'S. EXTEND OUT THE PROVISIONAL LICENSE PROGRAM FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IT'S LESS THAN SIX YEARS NOT BECAUSE- THEY ARE. ENORMOUS SEQUEL ACOLYTES OF BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO HAVE A BROADER REVIEW OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH WERE APPLYING SECRETIVE VARIOUS. PROJECTS AND- THE OTHER THING I THINK THE REMOTE COMMUNITY TO GRAPPLE WITH IS- THE FACT THAT THE IF THE APPLICATION SEQUIN THIS SPACE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN- WITH. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A- MAJOR BUILDING IN FREMONT- LOS ANGELES AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTORS THAT ARE- YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A THAT ARE THAT ARE NOT GUILTY IT WAS OFF THE GRID SOMETIMES AND SO AB. SO- SO THANK YOU FOR STEPPING INTO THIS IS THAT WONDERFUL CAN OF WORMS SENATOR I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR YOUR YOUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO. SOLVE SOME OF THESE VERY KNOTTY ISSUES- PUN INTENDED I SUPPOSE- AND- BUT BUT BUT THIS IS THE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THIS BILL AND I CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO EXPECT ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TIME ON THIS BILL IF IT WAS FOR TODAY. ANYWAY SO DEJECTED. OKAY DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR ANYTHING ON IT SAYS I COUNTY I JUST HOPE THAT WE DON'T FORGET TO CONSUMERS AT THE END OF THE DAY TELL TELL ME MARTIN SAID HIS SERPENT WE WE'VE WE'RE WORRIED I MEAN. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS PROP SIXTY FOUR SO PRESCRIPTIVE THAT YOU JUST WANT TO PULL YOUR HAIR OUT. HEY JUST SO YOU KNOW I. MEAN I KNOW THE ADVOCATES THINK IT'S THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD. THIS IS. IS THAT PROMOTE LEGISLATORS POINT OF VIEW THERE'S SO MUCH NONSENSE AND BENSALEM. SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE AND WORKABLE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK BUT- I'LL- ALL MOVED BILL LONG I. UNDERSTAND SORT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS STAY. HERE YES THAT'S RIGHT- BIG WOULD YOU WOULD YOU MENTION CONSUMERS'S OUR PARTICULAR SHE THINK WE NEED TO BE. WELL IT'S MOSTLY CONSUMERS OUR SOPHISTICATED AT LEAST SURVIVE THAT CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE WHOLE STATE BUT BUT THE ONE PRODUCT THEY WANT PRODUCT THAT'S FRESH THEY ONE PRODUCT FROM DIRECTLY HE SELECTED. THE OF THE BEER INDUSTRY WHERE THEY KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GROWING THIS GROWING THE PRODUCT AND THEY WANTED AND I REGULATIONS HAVE SORT OF MADE IT A ONE YEAR JOURNEY. AND YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE WAITING FOREVER TO GET TO GET TO GO THROUGH ALL THE LOOPS AND MAKE SURE THE TAX RETURN AND IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THAT A LOT OF FOLKS ARE TO STAY IN THE GREAT SOUND AND JUST ST ASSISTANCE. JUST DOESN'T WORK AND WE HAVE TO TRY TO GET SOME MARRIAGE BETWEEN BETWEEN THOSE FOLKS AND BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE DOING IT THERE'S A LOT OF. YOU KNOW BIG INDUSTRY DOES COMING IN THAT'S WORK ON THAT AND THAT'S ANOTHER ELEMENT OF HERE IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY BROUGHT UP CONSISTENCY Q. BUT THERE'S THAT'S ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT'S GOING ON SO. IT ALL BUT CERTAIN TO WORK CONCERT. SKINNER WELL. I. IF MY PHONE'S NOT OKAY. IT BEFORE AND IT DIDN'T TURN RED- I CAN'T SPEAK FOR IF MY COLLEAGUE FROM FREMONT WAS IF THIS WAS PART OF WHAT HE WAS INTENDING BUT I'M GOING TO ASSUME YES WHEN HE SAYS CONCERN FOR THE CONSUMER AND THAT IS THAT. WE THE VOTERS PASSED SIXTY FOUR AND YES IT'S BUT YOU KNOW I THINK CASH OVERLY COMPLICATED BUT THE FEELING PROBABLY WAS BY THE DRAFTERS THAT IT NEEDED TO BE BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS- OUR PROPOSITION DID NOT SUCCEED AND SO YOU KNOW OF THE PRIDE TRIED TO CROSS EVERY T. AND DOT EVERY I TOO MUCH. SO MEANWHILE THE VOTERS OF SAID WE WANTED LEGAL WE WANTED ACCESSIBLE WE WANTED LEGAL. AND WE WANT YOU KNOW WHEN WE'D LIKE A CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY BUT WE HAVE TO THIS DAY. THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR DOLLARS SPENT ON CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA IS IN THE ILLICIT MARKET. SO WE WANT TO. DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT THE LEGAL MARKET. AND THAT'S HOW I TAKE WHAT SENATOR CAFIERO YOU KNOW HER INTENTIONS. AND SO. AND THAT'S WHERE I FEEL LIKE WE DO NEED TO. BE- IF WITH THE CONSUMERS IN MIND WILL BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN BOTH THE CONSUMER IN MIND AND THOSE BUSINESSES THAT PLAY BY THE RULES WILL BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT THE LEGAL MARKET. BECAUSE OTHERWISE OUR ACTIONS ARE IN EFFECT- WRAPPING UP THE ILLICIT MARKET. ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT SO V. ITEM HAS BEEN MOVED IF AT CENTER LIKE TO CLOSE ALL ADULT THAT IS MY CLOTHES I THINK THAT'S THE BEST STATEMENT THAT- THAT CAN BE SAID WHICH IS THAT REALLY WHAT WE WANT IS WE WANT TO BRING EVERYBODY INTO THAT THE LEGAL MARKET AND THE MORE THAT WE MAKE IT HARD FOR THEM TO DO THAT THAT. THE MORE WE'RE GONNA END UP WITH CONFLICT AROUND THE WHOLE ISSUE AND THE TO GET BACK TO US SENATOR DOLLY IS THAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT MONEY FOR ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THE QUESTION JEFF THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE ARE LEGAL GROWS THAT ARE DECIMATING THE ENVIRONMENT. AND WE NEED TO PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS AND- BUT GIVE PEOPLE A PATHWAY TO BE ABLE TO BECOME LEGAL SO I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE I MEAN IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM OUT AND MANY PARTS OF STATE NECESSARY AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE A SHARED AGENDA TO. PREVENT THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEVASTATION IT'S BEING ROBBED BY SOME OF THESE INCREDIBLY RESPONSIBLE FARMERS- AND REALLY HARMING OTHERS GOOD FARMERS SO LET'S LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON THAT I KNOW YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT THE SUBJECT HERE AS WELL AND pBUDGET CHAIR HAS FOUL SO- LET'S LET'S WORK ON THAT AND DEAL WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING ON CERTAIN HABITS FOR THE BILL TODAY IN.

IT'S GOOD IT'S YOU'RE STILL CLINGING TO YOUR POSITION ON THIS COMMITTEE SENATE- IT'S FUN TO WATCH OKAY SO IT'S NO GOOD ITEM SIXTEEN YEARS AND AS MEMBERS THIS IS A- SENATOR DODD'S BILL FOR FIFTY ONE TALK ABOUT A WORK IN PROGRESS. HERE WE ARE AGAIN- SO AS YOU MAY YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. SUPPORT WELL RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR HELLO THIS IS GERMAN. SB FIFTY ONE WOULD AUTHORIZE CAL RECYCLE TO ESTABLISH A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM THAT WILL GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER REFORMS OF THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA'S BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM THE CURRENT BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO IT DESPITE ITS MANY SUCCESSES OVER THE YEARS IT'S NOW FACING UNDENIABLE CHALLENGES. THE RECYCLING RATES OF FALL FROM EIGHTEEN WITH GLASS FALLING DOWN 265% 66% SKEWS ME. THE C. R. V. PROGRAM COSTLY RUNS IN THE DEFICITS OF RECYCLING RATES HAVE CONTINUED TO DECLINE DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF RECYCLING CENTERS. MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR CALIFORNIANS TO RETURN THEIR USE CONTAINERS. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS ONLY HIGHLIGHTED THE EXT THE EXTENT TO WHICH CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO RECYCLING CENTERS IN TIMES WHEN THEY NEED THEIR DEPOSIT BACK. MORE THAN EVER. S. B. FOUR FIFTY ONE ADDRESSES THOSE ISSUES BY DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK FOR A PILOT PROJECT. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE PILOT PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT VARIOUS METHODS WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE- EXPERIENCE OF OTHER. COUNTRIES IN THEIR SIX US. SPECIFICALLY THE PILOT PROGRAM WILL ACHIEVE A MINIMUM 80% RECYCLING RATE FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS EXTEND THE ELIGIBILITY FOR ALL BEVERAGE CONTAINERS TO BE RECYCLED. INCLUDING WINE AND SPIRITS CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM OPERATOR THAT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HANDLING. ALSO SEE METHOD OF ALL BEVERAGE CONTAINERS DESIGNER KERBSIDE COLLECTION SYSTEM AND CREATE A SPECIFIC BEVERAGE CONTAINER BEEN THAT WILL HELP INCREASE CONSUMER CONVENIENCE. GIVE CAL RECYCLES ABILITY TO PICK UP BOTH APPROVED THE THREE YEAR PLAN IT ALL OUT OF THE RESULTS. THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM IS WELL SUITED TO HELP INFORM US ON HOW CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER IN THIS AREA. I'M ALSO PROUD TO HAVE THE WINE INSTITUTE REPRESENTING NOT ONLY A VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRY IN OUR STATE BUT ALSO PRODUCT MANUFACTURER IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS WE NEED AN INDUSTRY TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE. COLLAPSE WE NEED INDUSTRY TO BE CONSTRUCTED COLLABORATOR COLLABORATORS AND PARTICIPANTS IN OUR EFFORTS. I'M AWARE THAT THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM STILL NEEDS A LOT MORE WORK AND I'M COMMITTED TO PIVOT SB FOUR FIFTY ONE TO MORE SUBSTANTIVE AND IMPLEMENTABLE BILL AS A CONVERSATION DEVELOPS WAS STAKEHOLDERS- I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO BRING THE BILL BACK THIS BILL BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE- WHAT I AM IN THE BILL WOULD MORE SUBSTANTIVE LANGUAGE. WITH ME TODAY IS TIM SCHMELZER FROM THE WINE INSTITUTE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IN PERSON. ARE YOU DOING I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE AWHILE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- TIM SCHMELZER WITH WINE INSTITUTE AND WE REPRESENT OVER A THOUSAND MEMBERS THROUGHOUT- CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR FIFTY ONE THIS MORNING. ONE INSTITUTE WELCOMES THE GREATER FOCUS ON EFFORTS TO IMPROVE RECYCLING CALIFORNIA. AND OUR MEMBERS ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING EFFORTS TO DO JUST THAT AND TO BE IN RESPONSIBLE STAKEHOLDERS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THIS WAY LEGISLATORS HAVING. TO CREATE A TRULY CIRCULAR ECONOMY REGARDING PACKAGING AND THE CONTAINERS THAT DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS. AS SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NOW OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE WINE INDUSTRY IS COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES BOTH FINANCIAL AS WELL AS TIME AND ENERGY. TO EXPLORING WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN ASSIST CALIFORNIA INCREASING TO INCREASE THE RECYCLING OF OUR PRODUCT CONTAINERS. ARE SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE IS JUST ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE'RE DEMONSTRATING OUR COMMITMENT TO THIS EFFORT. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED SB FOUR FIFTY ONE WOULD AUTHORIZE CALL RECYCLE TO IMPLEMENT A PILOT PROJECT. WHICH WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPLY TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS LESSONS LEARNED FROMACTUAL BEVERAGE RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. TO DEMONSTRATE HOW PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP APPROACH WHICH INVOLVES PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS AS WELL AS STAKEHOLDERS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. WE BELIEVE. THE CRITERION FOR FIFTY ONE FOR THE PILOT PROJECT. CAN DEMONSTRATE MEANINGFUL WAYS THAT WE CAN INCREASE RECYCLING OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION THE BILL BOTH ESTABLISHES GOALS FOR THE PROJECT IN A MEANS TO EVALUATE ITS SUCCESS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO BEING CONSTRUCTIVE COLLABORATORS IN THIS IMPORTANT STATE AND STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOALS AND THE PILOT PROGRAM AND THAT THAT'S BEFORE FIFTY ONE. WE INTEND TO BE FULLY COMMITTED PARTICIPANTS IN THIS EFFORT. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON S. B. FOUR FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU JIM. ALL RIGHT.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN VERSUS TONY GONZALEZ REPRESENTING TOM AND YOURS MEREKA WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB FOUR FIFTY ONE IN CONCEPT AND SENATOR DODD MENTIONED THERE ARE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND- HOLD TO BE FILLED- BUT ONE POINT WE'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO INTEGRATE. WINE AND LIQUOR INTO A COLLECTION SYSTEMS FIVE HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY OREGON NEW YORK VERMONT AND OTHERS IN JUST ONE ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE WITH THE COMMITTEE- FOR NOW WITH THE BILL IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD INTO THAT- VIDAK: CENTERS ARE SEEN AS THE ARE REALLY THE ANSWER TO COLLECTING WINE PRIMARILY THE ISSUE RIGHT ONE INCLUDING A LIQUOR BOTTLES.

MODERATOR CHILL THANK YOU TO SHOW OPPOSITION FOR SB FOUR FIFTY ONE PLEASE PRESS STAR FOLLOWED BY ZERO. THE INITIAL OPPOSITION TO SB FOUR FIFTY ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO I APOLOGIZE ONE FILED BY ZERO. ANDTHE FINAL REMINDER PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO SHOWOPPOSITION TO S. B. FOUR FIFTY ONE. I KNOW THERE'S NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION SO AND- BUT YOU SURE NOBODY IS GIVING UP OKAY ARE YOU THINK YOU. THANK YOU MODERATOR AND THANK YOU MR- THAT FOR YOU SENATE DOT. SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SPACE THAT TIME IT IS WASTE MANAGEMENT I SPACE NUMBER OF US HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF INTERESTING I'VE ACTUALLY GOT SB THIRTY FOUR COMING UP BY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND- TODAY WE ARE RECEIVE- WHEN WORKING WITH SENATE WHAT KASKY ON ON HIS- RELATING TO THE BOTTOM BILL SO I JUST WANT TO SAY- FROM THE OUTSET THAT I. YOU KNOW I'M SUPPORT OF THE BILL MOVING OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOU. TRYING TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. WITH REGARDS TO A PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURBSIDE COLLECTION PROGRAM- BY THINK. ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S BECOME SO ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO ME AS I'VE GOTTEN DEEPER INTO THIS POLICY MAKING AREA- CURBSIDE. CONTAMINATION ISSUES. THE BIG ISSUE. ARE YOU KNOW. WE'RE SINGLE STREAMING EVERYTHING GLASS AB. BIZ BOTH IT WILL IT BOTH. GETS CONTAMINATED BY IT'S- IT'S HARDER TO RECYCLE GLASS GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION. WITH WITH SINGLE STREAMING AND IT ALSO THE GLASS WHEN IT BREAKS UP AND UP CONTAMINATING IN FACT BECOMING A DANGER. TO BE HONEST- WITHOUT WITH OTHER RECYCLABLE MATERIALS. SO I'M I'M REALLY HOPEFUL THAT YOUR BILL WILL HELP TO START THE CONVERSATION ON HOW TO FIX THAT. NOW A WE SEE EVEN SEE FROM THE COMMENTS OF THE BIG BILL AND YET THERE DOESN'T SEEM TOBE A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT YET I THINKS PEOPLE STILL TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE BILL DOES. STAFFREPORT. TALKS ABOUT HOW THERE'S LOTS. OF WORK TO BE DONE ON THE BILL LOTS OF QUESTIONS. I THINK UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES- YOU KNOW WE WOULD ASK THE AUTOR TO CONSIDER MAKING THE BILL IT TO YOUR BILL- TO GIVE THE AUTHOR MORE TIME TO WORK THINGS OUT ENGAGE WITH A VERY STAKEHOLDERS. AND OF COURSE I THINK NOT ONLY IS IT POSSIBLE IT'S PERHAPS LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE A TO YOUR BILL- JUST GIVEN THE ENORMITY OF THE ISSUES YOU'RE TRYING TO. DEAL WITH AND HOW IT INTERPLAY'S WITH OTHER WORK THAT'S HAPPENING THAT BEING SAID. YOUR BREAK YOU'RE BRINGING UP IMPORTANT IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON WHY- IF THE STARS ALIGN WE CAN'T GET MEANINGFUL POLICY TOGETHER EVEN THIS YEAR- IN THIS IN THIS SPACE. I'M NOT I ALSO IMAGINE IT IS MORE THE PROVISIONS GET FLUSHED OUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE STAKEHOLDERS. WAY AND BECOME MORE. INVOLVED OBVIOUSLY THERE IS ENORMOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THIS BILL IN THE CURRENT BOTTLE BILL pCHANGES THE BOTTLE BILL. WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO ON. YOU KNOW UNDERMINE. OR ON INTENSELY DISMANTLE. SPEAKING OF BOTH EXISTING AND FUTURE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THIS IMPORTANT RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR MANY ENTITIES ITS CERTAINLY THE MODELS NOT A PERFECT BILL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT A LOT OF THIS COMMITTEE- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THERE AND NOW WE DON'T WANT TO UNDERMINE IT. AT THE GOOD STUFF. SO I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO- IN SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS VAIN. IN DRIVING THIS CONVERSATION I KNOW I GUESS FOR ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR STAFF WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR STAFF. AND THAT YOU AND I WERE TOGETHER IN THE WORK OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- THE PILOT PROGRAM IS. FOR YOUPROPOSES COMPLICATED I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE APPROACHED IN A THOUGHTFUL MANNER NOT RUSH THROUGH- QUICKLY AND SO IT'S WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT I'M- TIME I'M GONNA GO FOR THE BILL-TODAY- BUT- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S EYES WIDE OPEN GIVEN HOW MUCH WORK IS STILL YET TO BE DONE IN- IN FLUSHING OUT. THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL AND ITS INTERACTION WITH OTHER BOTH CURRENT. LAW AND ALSO INTERACTION WITH OTHER BILLS THAT ARE MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH SO. ARE THEY WITH THAT COMMENT I LOVE TO OPEN UP TO THE COMMITTEE AND GET PEOPLE START TO QUESTIONS OR- ANYTHING THEY WANT TO RAISE WITH THE SENATOR. ASSEMBLY CASKEY. AND ALSO SEE MYSELF WITH THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS I WILL. MOVE THE BILL TODAY KNOWING IT'S WORK IN PROGRESS WANT TO CONTINUE WORK WITH THE AUTHOR WITH THE SPIRITS AND WINE- HUH THE FOLKS AS WELL AS THE BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION ON THIS AND I'M MINDFUL OF. THE ASPECTED SUB COMMITTEE SUBCOMMITTEE TO THE BUDGET WILL PLAY WITH CAL RECYCLE EFFECT OF ANY- CHANGES SO WITH THAT I'LL JUST. KEEP ON MARKET. THIRTY SEVEN. AT THE END I SEE I KNOW USE WHICH REST TO ME PRIVATELY BUT I'D LOVE IF YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO REITERATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO- A PUBLIC TO OUR OUR ROBUST ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR COMMITTEE LOS.

FIRE AND- FAHRENHEIT INTO HEAT SO. YES YES YES THERE'S A BOOK ALL ABOUT IT SO ANYHOW WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL MOVE I THINK YOU SENATOR LET'S GO TO CENTER ARCHULETA LET'S GO TO SB SIX SIXTY TWO. NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT ANOTHER TOPIC. HYDROGEN HYDROGEN CENTER TO LET HIS FAVORITE. FAVORITE ENERGY SOURCE. ARE YOU MAY PRESENT WHEN READING CENTERS HERE. I'VE I'VE GOT A LETTER THAT- I'D LIKE TO GET TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU BEFORE I BEGAN. BECAUSE IT PERTAINS TO YOUR OWN-PERSONAL DISTRICTS. AND ALSO REMOVES AND- VERY IMPORTANT OPPOSITION. AND I'LL WAIT A SECOND IF YOU DON'T MIND MISTER CHAIR. BEFORE I BEGIN. AND THERE'S SOME ITEMS IN THE BACK AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ALLEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOUR SIX SIX TWO I'M SORRY SIX SIX TWO. SENATE BILL SIX SIX TWO IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR AT LAST A FEW YEARS AND IT TAKES THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS ALLOWING UTILITY INVESTMENT IN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. MORE SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS INVESTOR OWNED GAS UTILITIES TO INVEST IN THE DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE OF HYDROGEN TRANSPORTATION FUEL. IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TRANSFER TOTIENT AT TRANSPORTATION ONLY IF THOSE PROJECTS DO NOT RESULT IN COST SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER RAGE OR RESULT IN A NET INCREASE TO ENERGY SECTOR EMISSIONS. BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER I WOULD LIKE TO THANK CHAIRMAN ALAN AND HIS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND WORKING WITH ME I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY MUCH. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS MENTION OF THE BOTTOM PAGE SIX THE ANALYSIS AND COMMIT TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO WORK OUT ANY REMAINING ISSUES. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. WHEN SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY THE CLEAN ENERGY AND POLLUTION REDUCTION ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN. IT MARKED A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT. IN HOW THE STATE WOULD INVEST IN ELECTRIFY IN OUR ROADS. IN FACT SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY MANDATED THAT ELECTRICAL INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES INVEST IN THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PLUG IN BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HOWEVER NO SIMILAR PROGRAM EXIST FOR INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES LIKE ALL ELECTRIC VEHICLES USED ELECTRICITY TO POWER AN ELECTRIC MOTOR. HOWEVER IN CONTRAST TO OTHER ELECTRIC VEHICLES FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES PRODUCE ELECTRICITY USING A FUEL CELL POWERED BY HYDROGEN RATHER THAN DRAWING ELECTRICITY FROM ONLY A BATTERY. HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE STILL AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. BUT FOR THE TECHNOLOGY TO GROW CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO FOCUS ON TWO MAIN PRIORITIES. ONE BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE OF HYDROGEN FUEL AND TO MAKE IT HARDER TO FEEL MORE READILY AVAILABLE THIS BILL SENATE BILL SIX SIX TWO WHAT DIRECTLY ACCOMPLISH THE SECOND GOAL OF MAKING HYDROGEN MORE READILY AVAILABLE. BY ALLOWING GAS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO BEGIN TO INVEST IN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN BEGIN TO ELECTRIFY SECTORS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN HARD TO ELECTRIFY FOR EXAMPLE BUS TRUCK FLEET SUPPORT SHIPS AVIATION AND OTHER HEAVY DUTY SECTORS TO NAME JUST A FEW. SOME CONCERNS WERE BROUGHT UP- HEADING INTO THIS COMMITTEE AND I HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS RESOLVING THEIR CONCERNS. AS MENTIONED ON PAGE SIX OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TWO WEEKS AGO IN STATE ENERGY COMMITTEE I ACCEPTED TWO VERY IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS ONE A PROVISION WHICH WAS ADDED. THAT MANDATES THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION COULD NOT APPROVE A PROJECT THAT WOULD NOT RESULT THAT WOULD RESULT IN COST SHIPS OR CUSTOMER RAGE. THIS MEANS THAT ONLY IT ENTITIES WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE NEW HYDROGEN PROJECTS WOULD PAVE FOR THE HYDROGEN PROJECTS AND TO. ANOTHER ADDITIONAL PROVISION WAS ADDED THAT MANDATED THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION COULD NOT APPROVE ANY PROJECTS THAT COULD RESULT IN NET INCREASES IN EMISSIONS TO THE ENERGY SECTOR AND FINALLY. AS MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS TODAY I AM ACCEPTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT ENSURE THE HYDROGEN GOING INTO THIS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE STATE'S. CURRENT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION STANDARDS. DOING THIS WILL ENSURE THAT HYDROGEN MOVING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE IS A STATE HOLE AND NOT CARBON INTENSIVE. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADDRESSED THE MAJORITY OF THE PRONE OF THE OPPONENTS CONCERNS. AT THE END OF THE DAY. ALL THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOW GAS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO INVEST IN HYDROGEN DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE IF IT WILL HAVE A DE A DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE TAX BY THE RATE PAYER INVOLVED. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. WITH BE ON THE PHONE TODAY I HAVE TIM SASINE BOARD PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN STATE HYDROGEN LANCE AND ROXANA BECO MAHDI EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WESTERN STATES HYDROGEN ALLIANCE BOTH- HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. AND HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR- SO YES LET'S GO TO LET'S GO TO MISTER SYNCING FIRST. THANK YOU CHAIR ALAN AND BUT YOU MEMBERS COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA FOR YOUR TIRELESS WORK TO BRING ADMISSION FREE TECHNOLOGY TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. MY NAME IS CONTESTING AND I'M YEARS FOR PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN STATES HYDROGEN ALLIANCE WHERE HYDROGEN EQUIPMENT YOU CAN ALSO MANUFACTURES SEEKING TO ESTABLISH A FAIR AND OPEN MARKETPLACE FOR HYDROGEN HAS AN EMISSIONS FREE ENERGY CARING ALTERNATIVE. TO FOSSIL FUELS AND GREAT EXPANSION. TRANSPORTATION WAS IDENTIFIED BY CALIFORNIA AGENCIES EARLY ON AS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO GHG EMISSIONS AND BASED ON THE INITIAL SUCCESS OF PASSENGER CAR YOU VIS. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES- THE CPEC SOUGHT TO ACCELERATE DECARBONISATION OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY FREE. BY USING REPAIR FUNDS TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGE TRUCKS BUSES ANOTHER FLEET VEHICLES THEY ANTICIPATED AND USERS IMPLEMENTING. THESE ARE THE VERY UP. THAT HYDROGEN IS SHOWN. ALREADY IN SERVING. AS A BEING SHOWN DRAMATICALLY CALIFORNIA'S INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANSIT ROLLOUT. RENDON AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA NOW OPERATE JONES- BUSES BUT LEADS OF TEN BUSES ARE MORE THREE MORE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PURCHASING FUEL CELL ELECTRIC BUSES IN FOURTEEN OF THE FIRST EIGHTEEN TRANSIT AGENCIES SUBMITTING THEIR ICICI ROLLOUT PLANS. INCLUDE ARE OPEN TO FUEL CELL ELECTRIC BUSES WHICH WILL CONSTITUTE ABOUT A QUARTER TO A HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S TRANSLATE. THAT INTO YOUR CELLS ARE COMMERCIALIZED IN TRANSIT TO DATE AND TRACKING WE'VE JUST COMPLETED A VERY SUCCESSFUL TO YOUR DEMONSTRATION OF A CLASS EIGHT FUEL CELL DRAYAGE TRUCKING COMMERCIAL OPERATION WITH YOU GET SIDE ORDERS OF LONG BEACH AND LA. IBM POWER YARD TRUCKS ARE ARRIVING THIS SUMMER AT THE PORT OF LONG BEACH INITIALLY THE FUEL SO YOU GET THE RIVER TRUCKS ARE RIDING. SACRAMENTO THE SUMMERS WHILE. DISTINGUISH COMMITTEE MA'AM THERE'S A LINGERING LINGER CRISP. THAT MOST. EFFECTIVE JEREMY TECHNOLOGIES ARE THOSE WITH THE BEST SO CALLED WELL TO WHEEL ATTRITION FEES. WHEN THE WELL CHANGES FROM A FINITE RESOURCE BURIED IN THE GROUND AS WITH FOSSIL FUELS. TO THE LIMITLESS RESOURCES OF WIND SOLAR GEOTHERMAL AND EVEN WAY POWER. OUR OBJECTIVE MUST CHANGE. BUT WE MUST SEEK TO DO PARTICULARLY WITH TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. IF THE FIND THE LOWEST COST METHODS FOR GATHERING AS MUCH CLEAN ENERGY AS POSSIBLE FROM THESE CLEAN RESOURCES. DIRECTING THAT ENERGY TO WHERE WE NEED THE WORK DONE DISTRICT PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES. WITH MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT. RELYING SOLELY ON THE POINT THE POINT ELECTRICAL GRID INTERCONNECTIONS IN MASSIVE LITHIUM ION STORAGE FACILITIES. WILL LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO HARNESS THIS ENERGY WHICH MAY COME FROM JUST AND OTHER TO REMOTE WIND FARMS. AND MANAGE OUR DISTRIBUTION OF THIS ENERGY IN OUR DANCE URBAN IMPORTANT VITAMINS AND TO REMOTE LITTLE CONSUMER. SUCH AS AGRICULTURE IN RAIL. I DIDN'T LIKE LIKE HAS NO. CARBON IN IT YOU. IS ONLY HOW OLD THEY ARE PER AT THAT YOU H. U. QU. CAL MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THE BROAD NUMBER OF ZERO CARBON SUPPLIES SOURCES AND MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION FACTORS THAT HYDROGEN AFFORDS. ARBITRATION EFFORTS SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION MUST BE INCLUSIVE OF HYDROGEN SO THAT OUR MOST RELIABLE LOWEST COST AND LEAST IMPACTFUL APPROACHES CAN BE AVAILABLE. AND THEREFORE URGES COMMITTEE DID SUPPORT SB SIX SIXTEEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. TEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AVE SOME STATEMENTS FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- IF SHE CAN GET ON THE LINE. YEAH THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR ALAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROXANNE BACK ON HOLIDAY AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WALKING DEAD HAS NO LIFE THE FUNDS ARE AT THE PICNIC.

HOUR LIMITATION CANNOT SERVE AS A ONE FOR ONE REPLACEMENT FOR BOXES TRUCKS TRAINS AND PLANES. I THINK THE DIVISION OF THE STRUCTURE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A DALMATIAN FEEL HIGHER CHEN. TO LARGE FEEL CONSUMERS LIKE EQUALITY IMPORTANT TRANSIT AGENCIES TO NAME A FEW. CURRENTLY THE HOUSING USED IN TRANSPORTATION APPLICATION IS. TWENTY EIGHTY EIGHT REPORT I THINK. HE FURTHER IF THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE CARBON COUNTY AND LOCAL PARK YOU'RE CLINICS FOR THAT CRITICAL THEIR OWN MISSION FIELD. I HUMBLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE IN ORDER TO TAKE ONE MORE SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD REPLACING DIESEL. FUEL AND JET FUEL USAGE IN THE STATE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU OKAY LET'S.

FUEL CELLS AS IF WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWING STATES TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE GROWTH OF EARLY IF POSSIBLE- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND NOT COMMITTEE. TO RECTIFY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT MANY MANAGEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY COMPARED TO THIRTY ASIAN AND OPPOSITION WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE CAR. BEEN ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL SO LET'S NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMUNITY CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU. SENATOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL THANK YOU- CHAIR- FOR THE HEARING IN FOR I THOUGHT THE ANALYSIS WAS- WAS VERY GOOD AND I. SO MY COMMENTS AND THEN I MAY HAVE A QUESTION IS. D. I THINK THE ANALYSIS- GIVES A GOOD BACKGROUND ON. THE. THE CARD IS THE STATE OF OUR TO REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THE ROLE THAT HYDROGEN COULD PLAY BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT STILL HYDROGEN IS RIGHT NOW AS THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED BEING PRODUCED- THROUGH FOSSIL FUEL SO IT'S MORE WHAT WE CALL GRADE HYDROGEN HOWEVER THE NOTICES POINTS OUT THAT WE HAVE THE- WE ARE MOVING. TOWARDS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE WOULD HAVE MUCH GREATER CAPACITY. TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN FROM NON FOSSIL SOURCES WHICH OF COURSE. WOOD NOT ONLY FROM A LIFE CYCLE POINT OF VIEW MAKE THAT ENERGY SOURCE FUEL HAVE WHAT HAVE YOU BECAUSE THEY BENEFIT OF HYDROGEN IS THAT IT CAN BE APPLIED IN MANY DIFFERENT IT'S VERY VERSATILE- ENERGY SOURCE. BUT THE BENEFIT BEING THAT NOT ONLY WOULD IT HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION BUT ALSO HELPING US MOVE OFF OF DIESEL AND DUST DEALING WITH ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AIR POLLUTING HEALTH IMPACTED AIR POLLUTING SOURCES THAT WE HAVE. AND NOW LIKE ANYTHING DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS. IT WERE RIGHT NOW. NOT FULLY AT THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE. THAT ADVANTAGE AND IT COST EFFECTIVE THE GREEN HYDROGEN HOWEVER. IF WE BY WELL I'LL PUT IN THE POSITIVE WAY BYE OUR SENDING WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE RIGHT MARKET SIGNALS WE CAN HELP STIMULATE AND JUMP START THAT HAPPENING AND THAT'S AND OF COURSE THE ALL ALL OF THEM THE MARKET SIGNALS THEY HAVE TO BE MULTIPLE ONCE THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS TO BE THERE TOO SO THAT'S A MARKET SIGNAL. AS WELL AS THE OTHER MARKET SIGNALS THAT WE THAT WE THE STATE CALIFORNIA SEE A REAL ROLE FOR THIS FUEL SOURCE ENACT THOSE VARIOUS MARKET SIGNALS CAN HOPEFULLY A LINE SO THAT THE INVESTOR COMMUNITY AND THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTOR AND- AN ENTREPRENEUR COMMUNITY PUTS THESE THINGS TOGETHER. NOW THE- OPPOSITION RAISING THAT YOU KNOW WE MAY BE JUMPING TO FAST IN AND BY DOING SO WE WOULD END UP- SUPPORTING OR OR MOVING TOWARDS MORE OF THIS FOSSIL FUEL BASED HYDROGEN. AND PEAK BECAUSE THEY'RE RAISING THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ANALYSIS SHOWS IT IN PRICE BETWEEN SAY THE ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCED HYDROGEN VERSUS THE GREAT HYDROGEN. NOW THOSE WERE VERY COMPARABLE ARGUMENTS THAT WE HEARD WHEN FOR EXAMPLE I CARRIED THE BILL ON ENERGY STORAGE MANDATE WHICH WAS BACK IN TWENTY TEN. AND AT THAT POINT EVERYONE SET OUT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE THERE WILL BE NO THERE WE DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES. THANKS AND IT COULD BE FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS. CALIFORNIA IS NOW THE LEADER IN ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY ENERGY STORAGE IS THE COMPLETE GAME CHANGER THE PRICES GONE DOWN BY A PHENOMENAL. AND HAD WE NOT ACTED THAT MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED SO THESE PREDICTIONS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET SOMEWHERE TO FIFTEEN YEARS YEAH IF WE DON'T. IF WE DON'T SEND ANY SIGNALS WE MIGHT NOT GET THESE CRISES THAT WE ARE FACING BOTH THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF AIR POLLUTION AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS ARE SO SERIOUS THAT WE NEED TO SEND THE RIGHT. MARKET SIGNALS SO- I. THE ANALYSIS DIDN'T NECESSARILY DETAIL ANY AMENDMENTS SO I GUESS SORRY I WOULD DIRECT THIS THE CHAIR I WANT TO SEE THE CHAIR IF YOU FEEL. THAT THAT THIS THE WAY IT'S CONSTRUCTED NOW. IS GOING TO SEND THOSE SIGNALS. BUT AND NOT AS I INTERPRETED THAT WE HAVE WE'RE FEELING. WE ARE FEELING THAT IT IS IN GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE TO SEND THOSE SIGNALS WITHOUT HAVING TO BE A NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF. OF FLOODING THE MARKET WITH GREAT HYDROGEN. ON AND I COULD ASK THE AUTHOR BUT I GUESS I'M ASKING THE CHAIR SINCE- YEAH I'VE- BEEN TO HAVE THE IVR RECOMMENDATION AND- YEAH I KNOW AND I'M I'M QUITE FRANKLY- YOU KNOW I KNOW I KNOW SO ORIGINALLY THERE WERE NO STIPULATIONS IN THE BILL. ABOUT WHERE THE HAD ORIGINALLY COME FROM THE SOURCING- AND THEN OVER AN ENERGY- THEY PUT IN THIS BACKSTOPS LANGUAGE. TALK ABOUT- AND- YOUR NO NET INCREASE IN EMISSIONS. SO WE WANT TO I MEAN WE QUITE FRANKLY WANT TO AMEND THE BILL TO MAKE IT TIMES BETTER FROM EMISSIONS PERSPECTIVE AND YOU KNOW THE IS THE SOURCING ISSUE THAT YOU'RE JUST RAISING- YEAH I THINK THERE'S SOME PRECEDENT OUT THERE FOR REQUIRING THAT X. PERCENTAGE OF. OF THE HYDROGEN. UNIT DELIVERED TO BE RENEWABLE WE YOU KNOW. SO WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN. TALKING A WORKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICE ON THIS YOU KNOW DOT HAS BEEN BEEN VERY MINIMAL CONVERSATION SO FAR- AND- TO IS IT THERE WE HAVEN'T REALLY LANDED ON ONE WE HAVEN'T LANDED OKAY EXACTLY WHICH YET- BUT BUT BUT I WANT I WANT TO FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR RAISING THIS BECAUSE I YOU KNOW AND I'M I'M YEAH I KNOW DAVID CENTER CERNER SHARES HIS CONCERNS AND- BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE ARMY OTHER MEMBERS AS WELL. I'M BECAUSE THE WAY IT'S CERTAINLY THE WAY WAS INITIALLY FRAME THAT EVEN IN ITS CURRENT FORM I DON'T THINK GOES FAR AND- YOU FAR ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE- VERY VALID ISSUES YOU'RE RAISING AYE AYE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES OF COURSE. CENTER SKINNER IS THAT. YOU'VE GOT A BILL IN THIS SPACE AS WELL AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE. THAT IS THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE WITH DODD BILL TO LIKE WE GOT THESE DIFFERENT VEHICLES MILLION HOW DO WE MARRY THEM AND ENSURE THAT THEIR- IN. THE MOVING FORWARD IN THE SAME SPIRIT SO I. ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS AND I GUESS I JUST WANT TO. SAY TO THE AUTHOR THAT TIME IF WE DO MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY THIS IS GOING TO BE. AN IMMENSELY IMPORTANT. ISSUE FOR US TO RESOLVE BEFORE. WE HAVE. YOU KNOW THE BEFORE WE RECOMMEND IT MOVING TO THE FLOOR AND- MOVING ALONG WILL I- AM I APPRECIATE THAT AND- I REALIZED I REACHED IT BUT I. AT THE PROPER TIME I'M READY TO MOVE THE BILL AND I GUESS I. AS MUCH AS I RAISE THOSE CONCERNS I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T. PUT THERE WE HEARD IN SIMILAR THE BILL THAT WE HEARD BEFORE AND CANNABIS THAT WE DON'T PUT IN SUCH RIGID. SAY AMENDMENTS THAT WE CALL FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM CUT OUR NOSE OFF TO SPITE OUR FACE AND THAT PERHAPS IT IS MORE. INTENT LANGUAGE LIKE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY- MUCH OF THIS WOULD STILL BE IN THE HANDS OF OUR VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES YOU KNOW MAYBE THE INTENT LANGUAGE OF THAT YOU KNOW TO HELP TO WHATEVER- INVESTMENTS ARE MADE A REGULATIONS THAT. THE FACTOR OR DO THEIR BEST TO- TO- TO MIRROR OUR OTHER STATUTORY GOALS RIGHT IN THAT WAY. THE REGULATORY AGENCY BECAUSE WE KNOW EVEN IF WE IF WE TAKE LIKE OUR CLIMATE GOALS WE KNOW THAT WE ARE. WE HAVE THESE GOALS AND BUT WE'RE MOVING WE KNOW THAT THEIR ALSO IN NOT INCREMENTAL PER SE BUT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS EACH YEAR WE'RE NOT EXPECTING TO DO THEM OVERNIGHT. AND SO IF WE DON'T IF WE PUT IN SOME INTENT LANGUAGE PERHAPS VERSUS VERY RIGID LANGUAGE IT MAY HELP. ACHIEVE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO- TO PROTECT AGAINST WITH- WITHOUT MESSING UP OUR MARKET SIGNAL AND NOW I KNOW I THINK YOU'RE QUITE FRANKLY I MEAN I'M GLAD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THINK OUR- OUR- THOUGHTS ELISE INITIALLY WAS THAT YOUR BILL IS GOING TO BECOME AN IMPORTANT VEHICLE FOR TIGHTENING UP THE CREATORS AND DEFINITION. OKAY AND NOW LOOKS LIKE THERE'S BEEN AN- BROWN'S BUDGET WELL I DID SAY IT'S AN ELEMENT OF FLUX I SUPPOSE SO I THINK WE'RE I THINK KIDS NOT TO MIX THEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR TO BUT I THINK IT'S AN WERE MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS AND I THINK IT'S IN GOOD. IT'S GETTING IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE IN TERMS OF- SAY THE CONCERNS OF MUCH OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. SYNTHESIZE IF WE'RE REFERRING TO MY BILL I THINK WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE IN. RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSPECTIVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. THAT'S MY HOPE THAT'S MY COMMITMENTS AND SO WE'LL SEE THAT WHEN WE YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE COME TO IT. WELL THAT'S COME OUT ON THURSDAY AND I WILL. I GUESS I WOULD LOVE TO. GET US ALL TALKING BEFORE THE A GREAT TODAY OR TOMORROW ABOUT THAT- BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS AN IMPORTANT. THE KIND OF OWNER COMPLEMENTARY OUT YES WELL YEAH. SO AS CENTER STERN. HIS NAME TO A CASKET I'M SORRY MR I'M SORRY OKAY CENTER STERN THEM ALL I WAS ASKING I'M SORRY HE ADMITTED. SORRY THE MANAGER YEAH I KNOW AHEAD PLEASE GO AHEAD OKAY. I'M THANKS FOR THE DISCUSSION ARE IN THANK YOU SEEN OUR TRUCKS YOUR LEADERSHIP SPACE- I LET ME BUT I WANT TO BUILD ON THE LAST COMMENT AND JUST GET CLARITY ABOUT HOW THE BILL WOULD WORK. AS AMENDED OR OR OR NOT AMENDED I I'M SEEING ANY ANALYSIS IT'S SAYING. COMMITTEE SHOULD DIRECT THE AUTHOR TO ENSURE ELIGIBLE PROJECTS DELIVER HYDROGEN THAT MEETS OR EXCEEDS ITS GHG EMISSION INDOOR AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION STANDARDS. IS THAT AN AMENDMENT OR IS THAT A- THE FOOD IS FUTURE COMMITMENT JUST TO GET SOME CLARITY. IF I MAY ASK SURE YEAH THE ENTIRE ADJUSTED WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS COMMITTING TO AMENDMENTS COMMITTING TO THE FUTURE TO COMMITTING TO PUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER BECAUSE IF I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN- THE SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT IS SO VALUABLE BUT AGAIN THEY'RE DIFFERENT CYCLES ARE ELEMENTS TO THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT HYDROGEN THERE'S PRODUCTION ITSELF THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW IT'S PRODUCED AND IN WHAT DIDN'T EXACTLY WITH PRODUCTION IS THAT OF COURSE THERE'S THE DISTRIBUTION AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THEN AS WE GO DOWN THE ROAD IF THE FUELING IN THE RETAIL SO THERE'S LOTS OF ELEMENTS DOWN THE ROAD TO MAKE THIS THING HAPPEN FOR THE SENATE BILL SIX SIX TWO IS THE FIRST STEP TO OPEN UP THE DOORS AND AS I'D GIVEN YOU- SOME OF THE LIST OF SOME OF THE CITIES THAT. YOU HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY STARTED WE NEED TO GO FORWARD TO MAKE THAT EVEN LARGER AND IF I MAY MSTER CHAIR JUST TO POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW WE THINK OF BILLS THAT PERTAIN TO OURSELVES AND TO OUR DISTRICT WILL LISTEN TO THIS IN MY DISTRICT ALONE. WE HAVE THE SEVEN TEN FREEWAY IN THE SEVEN TEN FREEWAY OBVIOUSLY CENTER GONZALEZ YOU KNOW THAT WELL PACKAGE COMES OUT FROM THE PORCH IN ALL THE TRANSPORTATION IT GOES INTO MY DISTRICT THE FIVE FREEWAY WHEN WE THINK OF ORANGE COUNTY EVERYONE HAS BEEN TO DISNEYLAND AND KNOTT'S BERRY FARM THAT'S THE FIVE FREEWAY THE SIX OH FIVE THE CUTS ACROSS THE SIXTY FREEWAY THE NINETY ONE FREEWAY THAT GOES TO THE AIRPORT. AND THE ONE OH FIVE FREEWAY THESE ARE ALL FREEWAYS ARE IN MY DISTRICT SO MY CONCERN ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THE WAY WE MOVE OUR TRANSPORTATION IT'S VITAL AND IN MY DISTRICT I ONLY HAVE THREE STATIONS IN HAWAIIAN GARDENS POINT PARK IN LA MIRADA IN YET. I'VE GOT SIX FREEWAYS SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THE GROWTH. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE SO WE'RE A LONG WAY WE FROM PUTTING THIS ALL THE- SO WHEN WE AT THE QUALITY OF THE AIR. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF WHAT WE'VE DONE TO PROTECT THE AIR AND WHAT WE'VE DONE. IN CENTER SKINNER WHEN YOU TURN THE CLOCK BACK TEN YEARS AGO AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IF WE HAD NOT. DONE WHAT WE'RE DOING WE WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW. SO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE CREATE TODAY THAT. THE AND THE WORK WE DO TOGETHER IT'S A KICK OF CLOSED DOORS SO WE CAN HAVE AN ADDITIONAL ENERGY SOURCE. THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. AND THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS IN AND WE'VE LOOKED AT. THE COST SAVINGS AND REMEMBER IT DOESN'T GO OUT. TO EVERYONE IN GENERAL JUST WHO USES IT. AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE SO ONE DAY AS AS I HAD MENTIONED TO CENTER GONZALEZ I'VE INVITED HER TO COME IN AND BUY TO ALL. TO COME TO CAL STATE LA THAT'S IN LOS ANGELES RIGHT OUTSIDE OUR DISTRICT THEIR ENTIRE FLEET AT CAL STATE LA. IS WITH HYDROGEN. THE POLICE CARS THE COMMUNITY CARS EVERYTHING THEY HAVE A HYDROGEN STATION THERE. AND IT'S AMAZING HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT SO WE FOLLOW SUIT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. SO DO WE HAVE WORK YES WE DO AND I AM WILLING TO WORK WITH THE CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE. TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO CONTINUE. THE EFFORTS TO MAKE THE SENATE BILL SIX SIX TWO- AND HAVE IT ONE DAY COULD GO TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK OKAY I MEAN IT IN OUTLOOK- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR OFFICE IS AGREED TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE EDITION. SHE IS SUPPOSED TO THIS IS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO CENTER STERN'S QUESTION IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE SIX OF THE BILL- SECTIONED I SEE. C. RIGHT NOW THE LANGUAGE HAS THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT APPROVE ANY PROGRAM OR INVESTMENT PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION THAT WOULD RESULT IN EITHER OF THE FOLLOWING CAUTIOUSLY CONSUMER RATES A NET INCREASE IN EMISSIONS FROM THE ENERGY SECTOR AS THE TERM OF THE STATE ARE YOU RESOURCES SUPPORT AND ANY ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE THE SALE OR USE OF HYDROGEN AS TRANSPORTATION FUEL THAT DOES NOT MEET RENEWABLE IMPLEMENTATION AND EMISSION REQUIREMENTS IN EXISTING APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SO THAT AND IN GENERAL I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR OFFICE HAS AGREED TO. BUT TO. TO ENSURING THAT THAT DID THE- DID THIS BILL ULTIMATELY IN VISIT THE LANGUAGE HERE IT IS AN AMENDMENT EMITS A CONCEPTUAL AMENITY REALLY TO THIS LANGUAGE I JUST I JUST ARTICULATED. CENTER STAR IN BUT THE IDEA THAT- DEAD DEAD- TO HEAR THAT THIS BILL HAS TO ENSURE THAT. THE PROJECTS THAT ARE DELIVERED MEET OR EXCEED EMISSIONS AND OR POLLUTION REDUCTION STANDARDS- NOW THAT BEING SAID. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TALK TO CENTER STERN ABOUT STRENGTHENING THAT LANGUAGE AND. AS TO GET CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THAT LANGUAGE DOES THAT WAS ALL JUST WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THESE ARE EVOLVING CONVERSATIONS I JUST WANTED TO. BE SUPER CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE COMMITTEES WERE VOTING ON I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF. ISSUES AND FREEWAYS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER BILLS BUT SO WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY. I'M JUST READING THE BILL ALONG WITH YOU I DON'T SEE THAT. THAT LANGUAGE ISN'T IN THE BILL WHAT YOU JUST READ THAT'S A LANGUAGE THAT'S LANGUAGE FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE RIGHT AS IT'S FROM THE COMMITTEE AND- THE AUTHORS AGREED TO THAT- AND- QUITE FRANKLY I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING IN THE IN THE IT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED TO THE MEMBERS- BEFOREHAND SO- I KNOW IT I KNOW THAT I KNOW THE AGREEMENT JUST HAPPENED BUT NEVER THE LESS I APOLOGIZE. OKAY THAT'S VERY HELPFUL MR SURE YET SO THERE ISN'T IT SO THIS BILL WOULD BE MOVING THE MOTION WOULD BE TO MOVE THE BILL AS AMENDED. BUT THEN WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM CENTER TO LET IS ALSO A COMMITMENT TO FURTHER. DISCUSSIONS- AT N. YEAH AND I AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD SAY IN THOSE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ALL I WOULD ASK IS THAT. YOU WILL CONSIDER- THE DETAILS ON THE ANALYSIS THAT POINT OUT THAT I HEARD THAT THE PROPONENTS SAY THAT. NINETY SOME ODD PERCENT OF THE HYDROGEN PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA IS DONE RENEWABLY I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DEFINE RENEWABLY GET THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT. THE STATE REQUIREMENTS ONLY THAT FORTY PERCENT. OF THE HYDROGEN AT LEAST TO QUALIFY FOR L. CFS. HAVE A RENEWABLE THE ONLY 40% BE RENEWABLE- SOME JUST I'M I'M UNCLEAR LIKE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE BEFORE ALLOWING THE GAS COMPANY TO AND- TO SEEK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RATE BASED INVESTMENTS FOR. FOR FUEL THAT'S 60% GAS NATURAL GAS BASED THE COULD COME FROM FRACKING FROM OTHER STATES AND PROBABLY WOULDN'T COME FROM FRACKED GAS FROM OTHER STATES. I GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT I'M I'M HEARING THAT YOU'RE GOING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION IN LIGHT OF ALSO THE WORK IS SENATOR SKINNER'S DOING SO. I'M I WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL SPACE TO DO WORK AND FLAG THAT CONCERN ALL. ALMOST ALL STAY WITH THE CHAIR AND VOTE I DID A TO KEEP THIS MOVING BUT I- YEAH I SIGNAL THE SAME TO CENTER SKINNER ON HER GREEN HYDROGEN BILL BUT- MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE YEARS. TO DEFINE SOMETHING IS ZERO EMISSIONS WHICH THIS BILL DOES. STATES RIGHT UP FRONT. YOU KNOW ZERO MISSION THAT ZERO EMISSION TRANCE TRANSPORTATION. IS HYDROGEN FUEL VEHICLES I WOULD SAY ONLY IF THE HYDROGEN FUEL IS ZERO EMISSION. AND IF IT'S. NOT YOUR MISSION IT SORT OF BECOMES A- MISNOMER IN THE DEATH. FOR CALLING ZERO THAT MIGHT BE 60% FOR GAS. BUT DOESN'T QUITE WORK ANYHOW I REALLY APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK YOU ARE DOING ON THIS- THANKS FOR INDULGING MY COMMENTS NOT BE YOU'RE YOU'RE RAISING YOUR RAISING- AB. KEY ISSUES- AND OF COURSE. YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE HERE IS. TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS FOLKS THE MINISTRATION AIRPORT OTHERS- AND YOU KNOW THESE BILLS ARE pAND- SO I THINK WE'RE MAKING SOME GOOD PROGRESS ALONG THE LINES OF YOUR CORE CONCERNS SENATOR BUT- YOU KNOW WHAT WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT ALL THAT INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS- WE WELCOME. WE WELCOME. WE WELCOME THEM AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE PROGRESS OF THIS BILL KNOWING 4% OF WHAT KASKY CONCERNED DOLLARS IT'S AN EXHAUST. THE REQUESTED THOUGH I WAS SAID MY COLLEAGUES AS CENTER STERN HAD. HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS THAT THE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN HE SAID IN ORDER TO THE TO GET THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. THE MARKETPLACE IS GOING TO IT. THAT'S TOO ATTRACTIVE OF A IS A STATE SUBSIDY NOT TO MAKE IT 40% RENEWABLE I GUESS THE QUESTION FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND- JUST FOLKS OUT THERE SAID. LOWENTHAL FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SET A RENEWABLE HYDROGEN RENEWABLE STANDARD HYDROGEN AT THIRTY THREE POINT 3% IT IS CRACKED UP TO THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT. WE KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GET THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD YOU. NEED TO GET FORTY. IN THIS. WE WANT TO KILL THE GOAL GOOSE BECAUSE WE CAN STIPULATE THAT HAVING HYDROGEN VEHICLES. ARE MUCH. MUCH BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND DIESEL VEHICLES AT DELL BEING REPLACED I THINK IT'S THE DETAILS OF HOW DO WE- INCENTIVIZE IS. MY COLLEAGUES- FROM. BERKELEY AND- INDICATED THAT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE- INCENTIVIZE A CREEPING UP OF A RENEWABLE CONTENT. WITHIN THE USE IT WITHIN THE PROCESS OF CREATING- HYDROGEN THAT DOESN'T JUST. MAKE THE MARKET GO FLAT SO. WE'LL PAY ATTENTION THIS IS COMING BEFORE SUBCOMMITTEE TO WITH THE ZEV MANDATE. THAT INCLUDES HYDROGEN- FOR US TO WILL. THAT SUBCOMMITTEE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT ALSO SO. I THINK CENTER SKINNER MOVED MATTER YEAH WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE CENTERS ON A ONE TO. CENTER DOLLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRED SO LOOK I YOU'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK IN THIS SPACE WITH. HOW DO NIAGARA I THINK THERE'S A TOTAL NEED FOR CALIFORNIA THINK WE'VE MISSED THE MARK- BY FOCUSING SO MUCH ON YOU KNOW. SEMATARY STORAGE HELL TO SAY AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. I'M IN THE TRANSPORTATION IS WE RUN DIESEL TRUCKS AND- TO DO BATTERY% TECHNOLOGY THERE'S GOING TO BE I THINK. SOMEONE VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE THE PRODUCTS AND GOODS THAT WE NEED TO SO I THINK I JUNE IS THE ANSWER I THINK THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR THAT- BUT IN THIS BILL AND I VOTED FOR. I SAW THIS AND I THINK WE SAW THIS AND ENERGY ENERGIA AND I VOTED AGAINST THE BILL OF THE THEM THEN THE REASON I VOTED AGAINST BILLS THAT. I WANTED WHAT YOU DID TO EXPLAIN HOW THE RATE PAYERS- WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL I BELIEVE THEY WILL BE. AND IF I READ ONLINE AS THE SEE WHAT SECTION I MEAN HERE BUT- BASS HE SAYS COST SHIFTING CUT- TO THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT APPROVE ANY PROGRAM OR INVESTMENT PERSONAL INTO THE SUBDIVISION THAT WOULD RESULT IN EITHER. OF THE FALL EITHER THE FOLLOWING. KASHIF DIDN'T CUSTOMER RATES. AND WE HEARD SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THAT CAME IN- TALKING ABOUT COST SHIFT IN THE TYPICAL. HOMEOWNER IN CALIFORNIA IS RATES ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE INDUSTRIAL RATES WHICH THOSE OF US IN AG INDUSTRY- PAY A HIGHER RATE- TO THE AISLE USED IN THE NORMAL HOUSE TO SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THE- RATE STRUCTURE WOULD BE FOR THESE IOUS. SENATOR I'M GONNA TURN TO THE TECHNICAL ADVISORS- IF THEY CAN JUMP IN I WOULD APPRECIATE IT- BECAUSE IT I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT THAT WE GET ON THE RIGHT THE SAME PAGE. AND IF I CAN ASK YOU HAVE. THANK THANK YOU SENATOR THIS IS ROCK FAN OF ECONOMICALLY AS THERE IS HARSH THERE WILL BE NO COST SHIFTING OF THOSE THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE PAYING FOR IT IN THE RATE SO IT WON'T BE- SPREAD ACROSS ENTIRELY BATES. SO THE SO THE PER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVESTING IN THIS TECHNOLOGY GOING TO PAY FOR IT. NOT YEAH THAT IS COMMON PARTICIPATING YOU KNOW I NEED FOR A PROJECT ON MINOR OTHER KINDS OF PROJECTS WHERE DOES THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM IT ARE PAYING FOR IT WITHIN THEIR RATE. I'M CONFUSED THEN OF HOW YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE THE RESOURCES TO GET IT DONE. THE I. O. U.'S ARE WHY ARE WE GOING TO THE P. YOU SEE THAT. IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO INCREASE THE RATE THEY COULD JUST SIMPLY GO. INVEST IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND DO IT ON THEIR OWN. SENATOR I UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK IT'S OF ALL THAT THE IRAQIS CORY AND HAVING A COMMON DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE NO THAT ARE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR I THINK WE MAKE- DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S JUST A QUICK A QUICK ABOUT THE WAY. TO HAVE A BROAD NETWORK THAT IS- ACCEPTABLE TO ALL. THANK YOU. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THEM FROM THE SITE AGAIN CLIENTS AS WELL- IT ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE TO LOOK AT IS TAKING A GAMBLE- BUT THE COURTS OF SAN PEDRO THEY WANT TO BECOME ZERO EMISSION AND SO THE CHOICES HOW DO WE WANT TO DO THAT YOUR LETTER CATION THROUGH GRADES AND BATTERIES OR TWO HYDROGEN SO WITHOUT SB SIX SIX TWO- THE ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE THE TERMINAL OPERATORS WOULD BE TO ALLOW THE BREAK TRADERS TO PAY FOR A GREAT EXPANSION INTO THE COURTS AND UPSTREAM GREAT EXPANSION TO SUPPORT THOSE TENS OR HUNDREDS. OF MEGAWATTS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE CERTAIN. IT WILL NOT KNOW IT BACK COULD BE DONE MARCH. GEN AVAILABLE HYDROGEN INDUSTRY OF A GLOBAL I TO COURT PARTICULARLY WHEN WE IS CONCERNED. AND WHEN THE UPTIME REPORT AND HAVING ENGINE SURVIVE WITH A HIGH PERCENT RELIABILITY CONCERNED SO IT CAN NAY EBELING THE ANALYSIS TO BE DONE COULD HYDROGEN SERVE THAT VERY LARGE ELECTRIFICATION BORROWED MORE. ECONOMICALLY BENEFICIAL EIGHTY AND STILL ACHIEVE ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS. OKAY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WERE- ERIC IS ERIC AVAILABLE BY PHONE AS HE CAN GET ON THE PHONE BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAD YOU THERE IS A- WE DIDN'T TOUCH THE RATE. LANGUAGE BUT IT WAS WORKED ON AND YOU SEE YOU SEE- THERE WERE SOME AMENDMENTS ADDED ON RELATING TO RATE PAYERS- BUT YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT WE DID NOT COME IN DESCRIBING DISCUSSION SENATOR DURING ENERGY TOO MANY. THE BOAT. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE NOT THERE'S NO WAY. THE RATEPAYERS MAKE YOU CAN'T AFFORD LIKE CHRISTINE CALIFORNIA'S IT IS WE HAVE 42% HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER STATE AND I JUST THE WAY I READ THIS BEFORE AN ANALYSIS I HAVE IT SAYS RIGHT HERE THAT THE RATES ARE GOING TO BE. THAT REPAIRS WILL PICK UP. IT WILL BE PART OF THE COST AND SO THAT MEANS THAT IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THAT MEANS THAT SOMEWHERE RATES ARE GONNA GO UP AND SO I'M TRYING TO GET MY MIND AROUND HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS THE POLICY OF IT HOW HOW IT WORKS IS. IF THE RATES ARE GONNA GO UP. I'M TRYING TO JUST FIGURE OUT WORKS I LOOK UP I WOULD IF YOU IF WE HAVE A LOT OF EXCESS. ENERGY AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY WE HAVE THE DOCTOR BUT WELL TALK ABOUT IT WE TALK ABOUT ENERGY COMMISSION AND I WANTED THAT TO GO FLAT THAT'S MY GOAL IF WE COULD. TAKE THAT ENERGY THAT WERE BASICALLY SHE COULDN'T AGREED THAT DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD AND MAKE HYDROGEN OUT OF IT HEY WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE WE TALK ABOUT IT. BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WORKS THE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WHERE DO WE SITE THESE PROJECTS WHERE DO WE HAVE ACCESS. EXTRA EXTRA ENERGY DURING DOES THAT HOURS OF THE DAY THAT WE ALL KNOW THE DUCK CURVE IS MESSED UP WE NEED TO TRANSFER THAT TO THE VALLEY OF THE DOCK AND YOU KNOW WILL REALLY BE DOING SOMETHING GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I THINK HYDROGEN IS A HYDROGEN IS A KEY TO THAT. I THINK THERE'S I THINK WE NEED TO BE A COMBINATION OF ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF STORAGE PROJECT BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THE POLICY HAD THAT COMES THROUGH THE SAYS HEY OKAY LOOK. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE THIS MANY MEGAWATTS OF EXTRA POWER WHEN THE SUN SHINING AND THE WINDS BLOWING. THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD START TO PLAN AND BUILD A HYDROGEN I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET SO FOR ME IT SEEMS LIKE IT ALWAYS GOES BACK. TO THE RATE PAYER AND- BECAUSE- BEING BEING PICK UP THE COST OF. MAKING OUR ENERGY. MORE RELYING OKAY SO THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING IS TRYING TO TELL ME HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK AND I DON'T SEE IT IN THIS. OKAY DO THAT TO BE FAIR THE SIMPSONS GOING BACK TO PAGE SIX THE FAMOUS PAGE SIX OF THIS BILL- THE AMENDMENT THE CITY IF YOU LOOK IN THE ITALICS IS ACTUALLY IN THE BILL- YOU TALKED ABOUT. MEMBER I TALKED ABOUT THE LANGUAGE ABOUT POLLUTION. BOB IN ADDITION THOUGH IT SAYS THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT APPROVE ANY PROGRAM OR INVESTMENT PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION THAT WOULD RESULT. THIS IS C. THREE. SUBBASAL NOT APPROVE ANY PROGRAM THAT RESULTS IN COST SHIFTS IN CONSUMER RATES. RIGHT RIGHT SO BUT WHAT DO YOU ARE YOU FEELING LIKE THAT'S NOT WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR CONCERN. WELL THAT THIS IS THIS WAS A MAMMOTH THREE THOUSAND WOMEN IN ENERGY COMMITTEE. THIS CAN. WHAT IS NEEDED I WAS N THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT ENERGY IMPOSED- LISTEN PRINT AFTER. FIVE I KNOW CENTER STERN HAD AND SOME COMPSON SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED EJECUTIVAS OVER THERE AND TO BE FRANK HONESTLY I I'M ACTUALLY CONSIDER YOU GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE GREEN HYDROGEN BILLS COMING UP ON THE THAT SKINNER SKINNER STILL I I'M ACTUALLY WONDERING WHETHER WE MIGHT WANT TO DISCONTINUE THIS BILL TO THURSDAY SO WE GET SOME OF THESE ISSUES CLARIFIED. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE A NUMBER THE ISSUES RELATING TO CENTER SKINNER SPELL ARE STILL BEING CRYSTALLIZING THEY'RE DIRECTLY RELATED TO SEASON IN THIS BILL AND SO I'M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE THAT MIGHT BE THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION LET'S GO TO YOU CENTER STERN. TO THE ENERGY NOBODY INTERRUPT YOUR COM. I WAS JUST I WAS JUST GONNA POINT OUT THAT IN ENERGY COMMITTEE. CENTER DR THE AMENDMENT CENTER ARCHULETA TOOK. PREVENTED- INVENTED THE ANY OF THESE COST BEING BORNE BY ALL RATE PAYERS. I MEAN YOU COULD SHIFT COSTS SAVE THE PORT BUILT SOME OF THAT HUNDRED INFRASTRUCTURE THEY COULD PUSH THOSE COSTS ON TO THOSE WHO AREN'T BENEFITING FROM IT SO THAT'S WHAT THE CAUTIOUS LANGUAGE DOES IF I COULD. JUST CLARIFY THAT FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION IT IT OUT IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE BENEFICIARY- HADES AS OPPOSED TO THE GENERAL RATE BASE NOW THAT STILL IS TECHNICALLY RATE BASING IT TO SOME EXTENT BUT- ANYWAY. OUR CENTER AND SALAS FOR PERSONAL SKINNER YES THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND- I KNOW SENATE ARCHULETA WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT IN AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO GO SEE AT CAL STATE LA AND YOU KNOW I HAVE A HYDROGEN FUEL- CHARGING AND STATIONS IN MY BACKYARD IN THE PORT AS WELL BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY THIS IS NOT COMING TO TRANSPORTATION SO I WANTED TO LEAN IN HERE BUT- KIND OF SURE THE SAME. IS THE SAME- CONCERNS AS WELL OF COURSE- WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE LANGUAGE THE BILL LANGUAGE EVOLVES WITH THEIR CURRENT NEEDS OF COURSE. AND IT INVOLVED EVOLVES WITH ARE ARE. YOU KNOW COMMUNITY NEEDS TO- IT. NEEDS TO SPECIFY AND I WASN'T SURE EITHER WHETHER IT ACTUALLY IS SPECIFIED AND I THINK. WE'VE DISCUSSED THAT UP THEIR TELEX ON THE ON THE BOTTOM HERE. THAT INCLUDES. THOUGH THE WORDS REDUCTION- VERSES THE NO NET INCREASE. AND THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AS WELL AND ENERGY COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH THAT WASN'T THE PURVIEW OF ENERGY COMMITTEE IT WAS JUST BASED ON THE- COST. OF THE COST SHIFT ISSUE- SO I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS- BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS THAT WE STILL NEED TO HAVE BUT I'D LOVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU SPECIFICALLY AS CHAIR TRANSPORTATION AS WELL. YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU I SO I WANT TO. LET'S GET EVERYONE'S COMMENTS. BUT I THINK WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS OVER TO THURSDAY IF YOU WE'VE GOT. IT YOU KNOW I. DID JUST A NUMBER OF THINGS I WANT TO GET CLARIFIED AND I WANT TO. BUY I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR. DOING SUCH A DEEP DIVE. THERE'S JUST A NUMBER OF LOOSE ENDS AND THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'VE GOT CENTER SCARES BILLS COMING UP ARE. THE START OF NEXT HEARING IS LITERALLY THIS WEEK SO IT'S NOT GOING TO HARM- YOU KNOW THE ABILITY OF YOUR BILL TO. TO MOVE. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW BUT I JUST THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF LOOSE ENDS WE NEED TO GET TIED UP. ABOUT IT BUT LET'S LET'S. LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM SOME MORE MEMBERS THAT WILL HELP TO INFORM. OUR COMMITTEES NEGOTIATION AND CLARIFICATION AS THE WEEK GOES ON. I CENTER SKINNER FALL BY CENTER BATES. THE. ONLY THING I WAS GOING TO ADDRESS THAT. WHY CERTAINLY. AT ALL OF US HAVE. WHAT CONCERNS ARE RATES. WE CAN HAVE HOWEVER THAT THAT WAS THE PURVIEW OF THE ENERGY COMMITTEE AND DAY DID ACT SO AGAIN YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SEIZE STILL SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHETHER THE ACTION WAS ADEQUATE- OBVIOUSLY DEAD BUT THAT'S NOT THE PURVIEW OF. WELL WHAT. KIND OF WORDS THE ENERGY COMMITTEE DEALT WITH THAT PART SO FAR PRT IS MUCH MORE IN DQ PART SO IN I PERSONALLY FILLED LIKE THE WAY THE AMENDMENT THAT COMMITTEE SUGGESTED WHICH- I WOULD JUST WASN'T SURE FROM MY STAFF SPEAKING AFTER THAT WHETHER THE COMMITTEE WAS ASKING THAT IT BE TAKEN BUT I THINK WITH THE DATA MANAGEMENT. THAT THE BILL IS IN A GOOD SHAPE. SO I- I WOULD RESPECT THE CHAIRS WELL IT WILL BE A DESIRE TO MOVE IT TO THURSDAY HOWEVER. I'M READY TO VOTE TODAY ON IT WITH AMENDED. YEAH I THINK I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE OFFERING OUR MEMBERS SO MANY QUESTIONS I DO THINK THAT pHAPPENED INCLUDING THIS AMENDMENT THAT WILL. ALLOW A LOT OF THE CONCERNS BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT ALL THESE ISSUES ARE BEING BROUGHT UP TO THE MEMBERS ARE GIVEN ADEQUATE TIME TO REVIEW EXACTLY WHAT OUR COMMITTEES TO AND YOU CAN SEE THE LANGUAGE. IT IS ANY ADDITIONAL- THINGS YOU WANT TO ADD IN OR OR OR BRING INTO THE DISCUSSION IN ADVANCE OF THURSDAY THAT WE CAN JUST GET EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE EVER FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE. WE CAN ALSO SEE HOW IT EVOLVES AND IN COORDINATION INDEED AS AS YOU'RE ENGAGING IN YOUR NEGOTIATIONS ON YOUR BILL. SOME APPS BUT- SENATE RATES ARE JUST WANTED TO SAY ON SENATOR ARCHULETA I'M- HE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR EFFORTS TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HE IN CONGESTED TRAFFIC AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ALL NEED TO GET YOU KNOW OUR CAR PLUGGED IN BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR FOUR HOURS WAITING FOR THE- TRAFFIC TO CLEAR SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE STARTING DOWN THE RIGHT PASSED. IT'S JUST THE RATE SHIFTED SO SIGNIFICANT ONE AT EVERY LEVEL OF SO THAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED AND THEN I WILL BE A STRONG SUPPORTER. OKAY ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. BOB GIVE ANY COMMENTS YOU WANT TO MAKE TO US AS WE ENGAGE AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN LET'S WILL COME BACK ON THURSDAY. OKAY IT MAY I THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE IN THE TRACHSEL TO OPEN UP THIS ENTIRE TECHNOLOGY. AND I AM MORE HAPPY TO SHARE WHATEVER INFORMATION WE HAVE. WITH SOME OF THE REQUEST THAT YOU'VE MADE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I AGREE GREAT DISCUSSION BY ALL- THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS FOR SB SIX SEVENTY ONE AND I THINK THAT. COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR WORKING WITH US- THE MEASURE IS A CRITICAL. IS CRITICAL IN PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE OF CLEAN FREIGHT ACROSS CALIFORNIA- AS WE KNOW IT'S THE BACKBONE OF OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY MOVING TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF GOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EACH YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME FREE QUARTERS ARE ALSO A MAJOR SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE. GAS EMISSIONS AND HARMFUL AIR POLLUTANTS THESE AIR POLLUTANTS INCLUDE PARTICULATE MATTER DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER. NITROGEN OXIDE SULFUR OXIDE WHICH CAUSE CANCER ASTHMA. SB SIX SEVENTY ONE TACKLES THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO CONVERT EXISTING FREE QUARTERS INTO CLEAN FREE QUARTERS. THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE CLEAN FREIGHT CORRIDOR. EFFICIENCY ASSESSMENT WILL THEN BE FOR HOLD INTO. THE STATE'S AGING FUNDING PROGRAMS AND GUIDELINE RELATED FREIGHT IN ORDER TO DRIVES. SHE IN HOW WE PRIORITIZE SUSTAINABLE IN FREIGHT. WE'VE ALSO INCLUDED A NUMBER OF EQUITY MEASURES AS WELL. AND TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE A RUSH DILLON THE SENIOR POLICY MANAGER FROM BREED SO CAL. AND MICHAEL TURNER THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AFRICAN GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR ELLIE METRO I THINK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE SB SIX SEVENTY ONE. THANK YOU CENTER. IT'S CLEAR WITNESSES MR WITH THE MEMORIZED ON. A LARGE COMMUNITY YES BURGLAR. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF MOMS ROCHDALEAND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THREE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX SEVEN ONE. BILL SENCILLAS FOR A CLEAN BREAK CORD OR ADDITIONS THE ASSESSMENT SOMETHING THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY DIESEL WHICH IS EXTREMELY HARMFUL TO PUBLIC HEALTH THE HELP AFFECTED SO SEE THAT WOULD BE- INCLUDE CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SOMETIMES EVEN PREMATURE DEATH. A CLEAN RECORD OR QUESTIONS YES ASPEN IS NOT VERY TO ACHIEVE HEALTH EQUITY AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST USED. AIR POLLUTION LEVELS MANY CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOODS ESPECIALLY BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES EXPLAINING TO ME THAT THE CONTRACT TRAFFIC INTO THE PORTS RAIL YARDS AND WAREHOUSES. THESE COMMUNITIES BEAR THE BRUNT OF DIESEL POLLUTION. WE NEED A CLEAN RECORD OR EFFICIENCY ASSESSMENT TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH EQUITY ISSUE BY GETTING CLEAN TRUCKS ON THE ROAD TO MITIGATE DIESEL POLLUTION AND ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. LASTLY IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THESE NECESSARY CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS MUST BE INTERDISCIPLINARY WE NEED IMPORTANT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE CDC. AND EVERY SOURCES BOARD WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS NOT DISPLACING RESIDENTS AND THE PLAN THAT EQUITABLE FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED. THREE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA URGES YOUR SUPPORT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NEXT YEAR FROM MICHAEL TURNER FROM ELEMENTARY. THANK YOU SURE ALLEN IN- THE MICHAEL TURNER ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND I LIKE TO CONVEY OUR SUPPORT FOR SB SIX SEVENTY ONE I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK CARE GONZALEZ FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. SB SIX SEVENTY ONE ADDRESSES ONE OF THE KEY TRANSPORTATION ISSUES IN OUR REGION EMISSIONS FROM THE GOODS MOVEMENT SECTOR WILL FULLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY TO OUR REGION WE ALSO SEE THE IMPACT IT HAS IN TERMS OF CONGESTION ON OUR FREEWAYS AS WELL. WHAT ISN'T SO VISIBLE IN THE AIR QUALITY IMPACTS OF GOODS MOVEMENT ON KEY QUARTERS IN OUR STATE. SB SIX SEVENTY ONE PROVIDE STRONG TOOLS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF FREEDOM MISSIONS ON IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO ADDRESS THOSE EMISSIONS THROUGH EXISTING PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES. THREE QUARTERS OF LOS ANGELES CROSS TRUE HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT AS A REMNANT ABOUT FREEWAYS WERE PLANNED AND BUILT IN LOS ANGELES THAT IS ALSO LEFT A LEGACY OF LASTING POLLUTION IN THOSE SAME COMMUNITIES. SB SIX SEVENTY ONE PROVIDES A FORMALIZED WAY IN WHICH TO ASSESS THESE IMPACTS BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING PROCESS SEES IT THEN PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BY LEVERAGING EXISTING RESOURCES THE BILL ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT WE CAN FIX THINGS FIRST AND FIX THINGS RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME. SECURE THE CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION THIS BILL IN ORDER SUPPORT THANK YOU TO TURN APPRECIATE THAT OKAY LET'S- I DON'T SEE ANYONE HERE IN PERSON OR IN ROOM TWENTY FORTY ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES YOU WANNA TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

AMENDED AND RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. ALLEN HI. HI ALLEN AYE BATES. FIVE EIGHT FIVE DAILY. DALY AYE GONZALEZ HI. I SKINNER. SKINNER AYE STERN. BURKE OWSKI HI MY COUNTY I. OKAY AND WILL HOLD THAT OPEN FOR CENTERS KERN SINISTER AND OUT ON. PINE FACTORS AND SPOKE TO PRESENT THE NEXT BILL. BUT HE'S NOT ON CAMERA THIS IS GO AHEAD WITH A TWO FIFTY FOUR OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S DO THAT AND THEN WILL WILL- THEY WILL GO BACK TO AND- THE CENTRE STARNES AFTER SB FIFTY FOUR SO I WILL. PASSED THE GAVEL TO MY ESTEEM BOOSTER THANK YOU. WORKERS ARE ALLEN FIFTY MEMBERS THAT IS PRESENT I WILL KEEP THIS BRIEF I KNOW YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS THIS ISSUE IN THIS BILL- IT'S BASICALLY A REINTRODUCTION OF LAST YEAR'S BILL. THE IDEA IS THAT SB FIFTY FOUR- SEEKS TO. REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DISPOSABLE SINGLE USE PACKAGING IN FOOD WHERE WASTED BURDENS TAXPAYERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAGUES- ART PUTS OUR OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO IMPACTS HUMAN HEALTH WE'VE- LOOKED A BIT INTO SOME OF THE TOXICITY ASSOCIATED. WITH ALL THE PLASTICS THAT ARE GETTING INTO OUR BODIES. HERE'S SOME FACTS WE ALL HEARD FIRST WHAT. LILLY LESSONS PERCENT OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS ACTUALLY RECYCLED. THE COST OF RECYCLING IT IS NOW EXCEEDING THE SCRAP VALUE OF THE PLASTIC MATERIAL ITSELF. I NEARLY EVERY PER PIECE OF PLASTIC IT'S PRODUCED IT'S EVER BEEN PRODUCED IT STILL EXISTS IN OUR LANDFILLS STILL EXISTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT THESE ITEMS FRAGMENT INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER PART PARTICLES. NOT CONCENTRATING TOXIC CHEMICALS AND CONTAMINATING OUR FOOD AND DRINKING WATER SOURCES WE'RE ALL APPARENTLY CONSUMING ABOUT A CREDIT CARDS WORTH. OF PLASTIC EACH WEEK. INTO OUR BODIES SAID THAT SOME OF YOU GUYS GOT A CHANCE TO SIT IN ON ON THE CELL NUMBER CORKS HEARING WHICH TALKED ABOUT. THE FACT THAT A MAJORITY OF HUMAN PLACENTAS NOW HAVE. MORNING LEVELS OF PLASTIC THAT ARE BEING- IT POTENTIALLY PASSING ON THAT TOXICITY TO. NEWBORN BABIES. SO THIS EXPOSURE IS GOING TO PLAY CANCERS BIRTH DEFECTS AND IMPAIRED IMMUNITY ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION AND OTHER SERVICE YOURSELF PROBLEMS IT'S ALSO BECOMING A- FINANCIAL ISSUE. FOR OUR COMMUNITY START GUIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BEEN ABOUT HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR NOW ON. ON ON LITTER CLEANUP AND LITTER PREVENTION- BUT THEY'RE ALSO IMPORTANTLY AND THIS GETS TO SOME OF THE ISSUES WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. YOU'LL REMEMBER THIS CONVERSATION CENTER DOLLY CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE NOW RAISING THEIR GARBAGE AND RECYCLING RATES TO KEEP UP WITH THE MOUNTING COSTS OF MANAGING ALL THE MATERIAL IT'S ULTIMATELY OUR- VOTERS ARE. TAXPAYERS REPAIRS THAT ARE PAYING MORE AND MORE. TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCERS HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME OF THE GUARDS OF THE PRODUCTS THEY'RE PUTTING OUT ON TO THE MARKET. SO SINCE COUNTY SACRAMENTO JUST RAISE THE RATES ADDITIONAL TEN DOLLARS A MONTH. TO HANDLE THE WASTE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE HAVING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE WITH THIS BILL WHICH IS. SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK. TO ADDRESS THIS POLLUTION AND WASTE. RACES IN THREE KEY WAYS OF ALL IT'S- BE. THE COSTS OF THE END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT OF THIS MATERIAL TO THE PRODUCERS WHO ARE ULTIMATELY THE ONES WHO REALLY DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT A PACKAGE FOR YOU KNOW WHAT WHETHER NOT TO THE- TO PACKAGE THEIR THEIR PRODUCT IN RECYCLABLE CONTAINER OR SOME. MULTILAYERED POUCH THE WHILE CONVENER FLASHY. BECOMES TRASH THE CLOGS OUR LANDFILLS WE'VE WE'VE- COME ACROSS SITUATIONS WHERE- PRODUCERS WILL LITERALLY CHANGE THE RESIN TYPE IN A BOTTLE. NO DO IT FOR IN A STATIC REASON AND THAT DECISION WILL SINGLE HANDEDLY RENDER THAT ITEM NON RECYCLABLE IT MEANS THAT THAT ITEM INSTEAD OF BEING- SENATOR RECYCLING SYSTEM IS NOW. GOING STRAIGHT TO THE LANDFILL AND F COURSE IT'S US IT'S THE TAXPAYERS THE REPAIRS THAT ARE PAYING THE COST. OF THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE PRODUCER WHO'S MAKING THE DECISION WITH LITTLE OR NO ACCOUNTABILITY OR SKIN IN THE GAME MORE. RESPONSIBILITY ASSOCIATED. THE SET UP THE FIRST THING. THE SECOND ISSUE IS SOURCE REDUCTION SO ASKING THEM TO YOUR RIGHT SIZE THEIR PACKAGING AND MOVE TOWARD REUSABLE SO. WHEREVER THEY CAN. AND THEN LASTLY REQUIRING THE MATERIAL. THAT DOES REMAIN IN THE MARKETPLACE BE TRULY RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE WITH METRICS TO BACK THAT UP- AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THIS HAS TO DO WITH MOVING FOLKS THAT THERE'S LOTS OF TYPES OF PLASTIC WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS. ONE THREE SEVEN AND- AND SOMETIMES IF A PRODUCER SIMPLY JUST CHANGES THEIR PLASTIC USE FROM A THREE TO A TWO. THAT ACTUALLY RENDERS THE ITEM RECYCLABLE- IT'S THE YOU KNOW- DID BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO THERE'S NO- THERE'S THEY HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING THAT DECISION. SO WE KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH AND COMPLICATED ISSUE WE SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE TWO AS TWO AND A HALF YEARS. IN DETAILED DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS- YOU KNOW WE CAME VERY CLOSE TO GETTING THE BILL PASSED LAST YEAR THE POLICY PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE. OF THE BOTH IN EARLY FORM AND THEN ALSO IN FINAL FORM- YOU KNOW I'M NOT GIVING UP ON A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS WE KNOW THERE'S A BALLOT MEASURE OUT THERE AS WELL- THAT. DID YOU KNOW. THAT IS THERE. ARE NONE. I KNOW THAT THEY DID SOME OF OUR SUPPORTERS ARE LESS OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN GET A MEANINGFUL BILL THROUGH BOTH HOUSES I'M NOT. YOU KNOW THE I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE PUTTING THEIR- THEIR ENERGY INTO THE BALLOT MEASURE AND THAT STILL MAY BE WHERE THIS GOES BUT- BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP UP. AND DONE COME UP WITH OUR OWN SOLUTIONS AND THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE MODIFY. SO ARE ANY HOW THE BALLOT MEASURE IS PENDING BEFORE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS BUT- YOU KNOW ALL ALL APPEARANCES SEEM SUGGEST THAT IT'S GOING TO QUALIFY. IT'S MY SINCERE HOPE THAT THROUGH OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH LEGISLATORS STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CRAFT A COMPREHENSIVE FROM PROGRAM THAT. ACHIEVES ARE ARE THREE GOALS A BILL THAT WILL BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH. TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY INDUSTRY BUT STRONG ENOUGH TO CONVINCE INITIATIVE PROPONENTS TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE. I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN DO THAT- WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL'S DEREK DOLPHY AND I WHICH WAS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES THE LEAGUE AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN WITH US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY BECAUSE THEY- HAVE ALTERNATELY BEEN. DEALING WITH THE BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WASTE. AND IT ALSO JORDAN WELLS WITH THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL. THANK YOU SENATOR. OUR MODERATOR. PLEASE I HAVE OF THE- LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES COME ONLINE. AND I'M NOT OT SURE IF IT'S DERRY GO FEET FIRST AND THEN JORDAN WELLS. PLEASE GO AHEAD.

CALIFORNIA HAS REBUFFED RECYCLING SYSTEM THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CREATE MAINTAIN AND OPERATE HOWEVER THE WAY CALIFORNIA RECYCLED HAS CHANGED AND SO TOO MUST THE RECYCLING SYSTEM CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE SEEN THE COST OF RECYCLING INCREASE IN ONCE RELIABLE RECYCLED MATERIAL MARKET NO LONGER EXIST. CHALCIDICE CONDUCTED A SURVEY IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT SHOWED SEVEN OUT OF TEN CITY SURVEYED ANTICIPATE OF SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING RATE INCREASED BETWEEN ONE AND 20% IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO UPDATING AND UPGRADING OUR RECYCLING SYSTEM IS NEEDED WE CAN NO LONGER FOCUS SOLELY ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT COLLECTING AND PROCESSING. WILL BE IN MIND AND HAVE AN END MARKET FOR THEM HOW DID HE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN DEVELOPING APPROACH THANK YOU AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTE AND HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND RESIDENTS PAY LESS TO RECYCLE WE LIKE TO THINK KINDER ALLEN FIRST CONTINUE FOCUSING LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE.

ALL EXTERNALIZING AND SOCIALIZING THE COSTS ON TO PEOPLE AND PLANET. BRING ME OVER TWO YEARS SINCE SB FIFTY FOUR WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. WE HAVE LOST BROWN AND WASTED TIME. THE GOOD NEWS IS CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS OVER THE PAST TWO PLUS YEARS HAVE ENCOURAGE EFFORTS IN OTHER STATES INCLUDING MAINE MASSACHUSETTS NEW YORK OREGON AND VERMONT.

PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT NOW THERE ARE OVER FOUR HUNDRED E. CARE PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD IN CALIFORNIA LED THE NATION BY PASSING THE FIRST EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY LAW FOR PHARMACEUTICAL THE NEEDLES. AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN.

WHICH STRIKES- FROM SECTION TO THE BILL THE TERM SCOPING PLAN AS A REPORT A OR B. WOULD NOT HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER- WITHIN- THERE SCOPING PLAN- AB BUT THIS BILL IS INTENDED. BOTH WITHIN THE AIRPORT AND THE ADMINISTRATION WRIT LARGE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND OTHER STATE ENERGY AGENCIES TO ACCELERATE AND- IMPROVE THEIR THEIR THINKING AND THE KIND OF PROCESS THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AS WE APPROACH SB ONE HUNDRED GROUP GOALS IT'S NECESSARY FOR. PC AND OTHER AGENCIES TO LOOK AT FOR INSTANCE THE OUTAGES WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST FEW YEARS- BOTH FROM WILDFIRES AND FROM SOME OF THE ROLLING BLACKOUTS WE SAW LAST SEASON WAS LOOKING OVER TO TEXAS I'M TRYING TO FIND A DIFFERENT WAY. TO BUILD RESILIENCY IN OUR GRADE AND CLEAN MANNER GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE I THINK THE CALIFORNIA CAN BOTH ACCELERATE IT'S PAST TO SB ONE HUNDRED WHILE WE MAKE OUR GREED MORE RESILIENT IF WE ARE ABLE TO CONSIDER AND EVALUATE MORE COMPREHENSIVELY A LOT OF THE ZERO CARBON. A BASELOAD TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE OUT THERE NOW- BOTH A COMMERCIAL AND DEMONSTRATION SCALE SO THIS WAS ALL- IDENTIFIED IN THE SB ONE HUNDRED REPORT RECENTLY PUT OUT THEIR OWN FIRM ZERO CARBON RESOURCES LIKE GEO THERMAL OFFSHORE WIND GREEN ALECTRA LYTIC HYDROGEN WHICH WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE HEARING TODAY LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE MULTI DAY ENERGY STORAGE AND OTHER RESOURCES. SO WE THINK HAVING THESE KIND OF FIRM FLEXIBLE BASE LOAD POWER- RESOURCES THAT ARE AT OUR DISPOSAL IN THE STATE WILL ALLOW US. TO BUILD OUR GREED IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE STAYED INTACT- NOT I'LL OUR- AND NOT. I KNOW CLOSING ARE OFF TO IT TO NEW RESOURCES AND DOUBLING DOWN ON- ON THE FOSSIL FUEL RESOURCES IN THE PAST THAT FRANKLY ARE MUCH MORE VULNERABLE TO EXTREME HEAT AND EXTREME COLD EVENTS. SO WE CAN GET INTO MORE DETAILS ANOTHER WORD THE TAIL END OF THE HEARING. TODAY I'M SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I BELIEVE- I BELIEVE WE HAVE A- THE BILL'S SPONSOR- CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN WITH THE JOHN WHITE AS WELL AS DAN JACOBSON WAS ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU WOULD GO TO YOUR YOUR PRESENTED IN SUPPORT. YES THEY ARE LIGHT WITH THE CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN YES PLEASE. OKAY IS EXPRESSED PERSONAL SUPPORT FOR THE BILL ALSO WE WANNA- FIRST OF ALL THANK THE STAFF FOR RUNNING A REALLY GOOD COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT I THINK PUTS THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL IN IN THE RIGHT PLACE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE NEED THIS BILL IS BECAUSE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAD TO NARAL A SET OF RESOURCES THAT THEY LOOKED AT. IN THEIR MODELING THEY JUST DIDN'T CONSIDER ART Q. THERMAL OR OF A LONG DURATION STORAGE EVEN THOUGH THESE RESOURCES ARE HAVE LATER BEEN CALLED OUT AND SEEN AS NEEDING TO BE ADDED SO WE'RE WE'RE BASICALLY DOING IS IT IN THE BILL IS EXPANDING THE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE ARE EXAMINING OUR PLANNING PROCESS TO INCLUDE RESOURCES THAT WE THINK ARGUABLY GOING TO BE NEEDED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN ACHIEVING OUR GOALS OF BOTH AFFORDABILITY AND ECONOMICALLY. WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU HEY WE HAVE A MUTUAL FRIEND AND CONGRESSMAN LEVIN.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN GOOD AFTERNOON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- ARE 1100% CLEAN ENERGY GOALS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE THE ADOPTION OF A DIVERSE SET OF CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. YEAH THE CURRENT MODELING CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS BEEN CONSTRAINED WITH LIMITED THE EVALUATION OF KEY TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CENTER DESCRIBED THE BOX FOR WIND GEOTHERMAL AND MULTI DAY STORAGE. SB FOUR TWENTY THREE RESPONSES CHECK TO THIS CHALLENGE BY ENSURING THAT SUCH TECHNOLOGIES OR APPROPRIATELY ABOUT VALUATION MODELS AND THAT THE VALUE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES TWIRLA TRICITY SYSTEM. ARE CONSIDERED. THE REASON CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION SAYS TO ONE HUNDRED REPORT NOTED THAT ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS IS NEEDED TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE PROJECT PORTFOLIOS WILL MEET SYSTEM RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS WHILE CONTINUING TO ASSESS RESOURCES ON TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY. PETER ANALYSIS BE UPDATED TO REFLECT THE MARKET TRENDS INCLUDING CHANGES IN PRICE AND THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AN UPDATE TO TOTAL RESOURCES.
