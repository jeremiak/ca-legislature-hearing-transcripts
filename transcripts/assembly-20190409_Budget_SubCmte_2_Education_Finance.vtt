AS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT THE

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.053
POINT BEING THE COAL IS NOT

ON THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:35.506
DOLLARS WHICH MEANS WITH RISING

COSTS AND BAO COLA THAT DOESN'T

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:37.174
COVER THOSE RISING COSTS.

00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:37.708

CHALLENGING POSITIONS TO HAVE TO

00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:44.315
RISING COSTS SO THE RESULT IS IS

00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:46.383
THAT FEWER OPTIONS ARE GOING

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.853

THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.474
THE THOUGHT THERE IS THAT WE

00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:12.409

DATA WILL SHOW THAT COMMITMENT

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.659

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:37.768
THESE RESOURCES.

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:39.036
THAT THIRTY MILLION WOULD BE

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.905
ANTI TO SOME PERFORMANCE BASED

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:42.106
FUNDING IN THAT REGARD.

00:40:42.173 --> 00:40:43.307
AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION OF

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:45.376
THAT HUNDRED TEN WOULD GO

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:47.111
TOWARDS I'VE BEEN HELPING TO

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:49.413
ADDRESS ICTP FEES ARE TO

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.915
MINIMIZE SOME OF THERE'D BURDENS

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:53.117
ON OUR STUDENTS RELATIVE TO FEES

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.618
THAT WE HAVE NO WHERE ELSE TO

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:55.953
PULL FUNDING TO BACK FILL.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.688
AND PROVIDE SOME GROWTH AND THEN

00:40:57.755 --> 00:40:59.924
FINALLY A FIFTY MILLION OF THAT

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.858
HUNDRED TEND TO GO TOWARDS

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:02.927

GROWING ACCESS FOR THE STUDENTS

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:06.497

THAT SORT OF GOES UP TO THE

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:40.677
RIGHT FROM 51% 253% AND SIXTEEN

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:41.544

00:54:52.155 --> 00:54:53.657
SO WE ARE SEEING.

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:56.960
DEFINITE SIGNS OF OF MOVEMENT IN

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:58.495

WANT TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:06.936
SLIDE THAT TALKS A LITTLE BIT

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:08.371
ABOUT THE THE REGION'S

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:14.778
TOO DEEP.

00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:16.146
BUT AVOIDING DUPLICATION

00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:17.647
ENSURING THE COLLABORATION IS

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.516

THAT AND ALL FOCUS ON THESE

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:41.137
OUTCOMES HOW DO WE GENERATE THE

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:42.338
INVESTMENTS THAT ARE LABOR

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:43.873

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:06.529
THE HIGHEST INVESTMENT FOR

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:08.465
STRONG WORK FORCE DOLLARS OVER

THE PAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN.

LEGISLATION.

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:39.028
FUNDING BY REGIONS THE NICE

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:40.730
THING THAT.

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.132
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THAT

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:42.699
WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE GOING

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.934

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:50.006
OUT TO MOVE STUDENTS FORWARD AND

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:52.075
SO THAT'S I THINK IN TERMS OF

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:57.280
OUR OUR MISSION GOING FORWARD.

00:56:57.347 --> 00:56:58.581
YOU ALSO HAVE EXPENDITURES BY

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:00.850
CATEGORY AS MORE OF A DRILL DOWN

00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:03.019
TO YOU -- AND THEN ALSO THE USE

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:04.454
OF THE SET ASIDE FUNDS HAVE

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:06.322
REALLY HELPED US TO DRIVE THE

THE DATA IS VISUALIZE WHICH BY

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.727
THE WAY.

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.228
LAUNCH FOR DATA IS SOMETHING

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:14.597
THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ASK FOR

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:16.432
OPENNESS AND AT A PUBLIC FACING

CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO ENSURE

YOU -- BUT I DO HAVE A ABOUT A

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:49.065
QUESTION THAT WAS ON IN THE

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:51.434
AGENDA AND ALSO ON THIS CHART.

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:53.837
YEAH I KNOW EARLY IN THE STRONG

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:55.338
WORK FORCE.

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:57.674
ROLL OUT THE AND TRYING TO

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.143
FIGURE OUT THE EFFECTIVENESS.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:03.346
NO REPORTS -- COMING. ONE THING

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:04.647
THAT KIND OF YOU KNOW.

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.249
IS AYE POPPING IS HOW MUCH IS

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.218
SPENT ON YOUR CAPITAL THE AND

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:11.387
SALARIES ROUGHLY 50% AND HOW

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:12.922
MUCH IS GOING [inaudible]

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.357
TO NON.

00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:16.826
CORE ISSUES THAT SAYS ADMIN SO

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:18.928
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT IS

00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:20.463
SUCH A TOP PRIORITY.

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:21.931
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MONEY IS GOING

00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:24.467
OUT TO ACTUALLY PROGRAMS FOR

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:25.568
STUDENTS AND LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:29.439
REALLY TOP HEAVY.

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:30.473
I THINK ONE OF THE CHRISTMAS

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:31.274
MONEY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:32.542
OFFICE SITTING ONE OF THE THINGS

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:34.077
THAT -- WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:36.546
CREATED -- WAS NOTED AS HIGH A

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:37.647
QUICKENING COSTS FOR CERTAIN C.

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:40.049
T. PROGRAMS THE ABILITY -- IN

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:41.384
ORDER TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:44.020
CERTAIN PROGRAMS WE NEED -- TO

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:47.090
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:48.658
IN THE HIGH COST OF FACILITIES

00:58:48.725 --> 00:58:50.426
IN HIGH CONSEQUENCE SO I THINK

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:52.095
YOU SEE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:53.429
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:55.865
BEING SPENT ON THAT I WOULD SAY --

00:58:55.932 --> 00:59:01.537
THE 26% -- DEAN ROBERTS CAN HELP

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:02.705
ME OUT YOU KNOW IT I WOULD NOT.

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:04.540
I THINK WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH

00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:05.775
THE CHARACTERIZATION THAT THAT'S

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:07.810
ALL ADMIN THAT FOR SOME OF THIS

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:09.579
WORK YOU KNOW I THINK.

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:12.048
A KEY PROBLEM STATEMENT OF OF A

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:14.884
STRONG WORK FORCE A REPORT WAS

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:17.020
THAT -- OUR COLLEGES NEED TO DO

00:59:17.086 --> 00:59:18.688
A BETTER JOB OF LINKING UP WITH

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:20.256
THE WORK FORCE LINKING UP WITH

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:21.658
OTHER PRO OP PROGRAM PROVIDERS --

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:22.725
I WOULD ARGUE THAT IS A

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:25.561
SIGNIFICANT PART OF WHAT WE ARE

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:28.197
FUNDING IN THAT -- IN THAT BLUE

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:30.333
CHUNK IN YOUR AGENDA RICK --

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:35.705
AROUND OTHER SERVICES AND COSTS.

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:36.606
BUT I GUESS TWO THINGS ONE YOU

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:37.640
SAY EQUIPMENT BUT EQUIPMENT IS

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:38.841
WELL I'M COUNTING THAT AS A AS

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:39.876
AN APPROPRIATE SOMETHING AND NON

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:42.946
EQUIPMENT AND NON INSTRUCTIONAL.

00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:43.846
SALARY SO.

00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:45.381
WILL THIS CHANGE OVER TIME

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:46.916
BECAUSE IT DOES LOOK LIKE YOU'RE

00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:48.651
NOT FOCUSING THE CORE OF WHAT

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:50.353
MATTERS THE MOST WHICH IS WE

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.888
DEFINITELY WILL SEE A SHIFT.

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:53.623
LIKE -- VICE-CHANCELLOR'S MEN A

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.458
MENTION THE FIRST YEAR ROLLOUT

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:57.660
IT'S ABOUT SECURING THE SPACE IN

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:58.661
SECURING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:59:58.728 --> 00:59:59.696
GOING TO DO THE WORK.

00:59:59.762 --> 01:00:00.997
WE KNOW FULL WELL THAT OUR

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.565
FACULTY OR THE ONES THAT YOU

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:04.267
KNOW OR THAT POINT WHERE THE

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.302
CONTACT IS WITH STUDENTS AND SO.

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.171
NATURALLY WHEN WE SEE EXPANSION

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:10.006
OF OUR PROGRAMS GOING TO SEE

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.774
EXPANSION OF SOME FACULTY --

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:14.043
THESE ARE THESE ARE ALSO

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.179
POSITIONS THAT ARE SUCH LIKE

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:18.314
PLACEMENT OFFICERS -- SO THEIR

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:20.016
JOB PLACEMENT AGENTS THAT HAVE

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.551
BEEN HIRED INTO THE INTO THE

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:22.585
COLLEGES.

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:24.087
SO WHAT THE COLLEGES REALIZES

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.990
THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB --

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:28.491
GOING FROM CONTINUING TO

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:31.394
CONTINUE ON AND SO THE THE LIFT

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:34.197
IN AND IN SALARIES WOULD BE TO

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.631
SORT OF HELP WITH THAT THOSE

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:37.433
THOSE CONNECTIONS SO -- BUT WE

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.534
DON'T FOR SEE THAT THOSE

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.336
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE WE WANT

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:41.838
TO SEE MORE NON CREDIT TO CREDIT

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:44.107
WE WANT TO SEE MORE CONTRACT AT

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:45.742
THE NON CREDIT TO CREDIT WE WANT

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.777
TO SEE MORE INVOLVEMENT UP ALL

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.779
OF THE PROGRAMS OUT THERE --

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:52.048
SOMEWHERE MESSAGING THIS TO THE

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:52.782
FIELD AS WELL.

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:53.750
BLESS WHATEVER I'VE JUST SAY

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.284
THAT -- I THINK PART OF THIS IS

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.420
DUE TO THE NEWNESS THAT A LOT OF

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.288
COLLEGES -- IN I THINK THERE'S A

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:00.189
LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:02.258
WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO USE

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.760
THESE DOLLARS -- FOR

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:05.862
PARTICULARLY COMPENSATION FOR

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:07.430
FACULTY GIVE AND NOT THINK THERE

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.699
IN GENERAL TENDS TO BE CONCERNED

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:12.435
ABOUT THE HOW STABLE AND HOW

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.037
SECURE CATEGORICAL PROGRAM

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:15.872
DOLLARS ARE AND WHETHER IT MAKES

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:17.673
SENSE FOR COLLEGES TO INVEST IN

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.508
THAT KIND OF COSTS.

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:19.976
I THINK AS THIS PROGRAM

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:22.311
CONTINUES -- HAVING SHOULD THERE

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:23.813
BE STABILITY I THINK YOU'LL SEE

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.282
MORE OF THOSE DOLLARS GOING INTO.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:32.255
THOSE TYPES OF LONG TERM

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:34.290
COMMITMENTS.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:35.525
OKAY.

01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:36.559
MR O'DONNELL AT THAT THANK YOU

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.127
MISTER CHAIR -- SO THE PROGRAM

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.195
STARTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IF

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:40.430
THAT'S CORRECT CORRECT IN THERE

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:41.064
BUT THERE IS REALLY REALLY BEEN

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.698
A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT.

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:45.101
IS THAT ACCURATE [inaudible]

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:46.335
FTS.

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.971
YEAH THE F. T. S. RATES ARE THAT

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.473
WAS THE INCREASE -- THAT USE

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.542
THAT YOU SAW ON THE IN THE CHART

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:55.044
RIGHT -- THE COLLEGE IS COMING

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:56.679
OUT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:57.947
YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LEVELING OFF

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:00.149
OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.551
ENROLLMENT ACROSS THE STATE AND

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:02.985
AND I DO UNDERSTAND IN BOTH

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.620
SYSTEMS K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:07.290
COLLEGES THAT THERE'S AN OVERALL

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:08.691
DECLINE IN ROMANS WERE.

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:09.826
REDRESSING THAT AS WELL THAT'S

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.627
PART OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES I

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:12.895
JUST I I THINK JUST.

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.064
TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT THAT --

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.299
YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR OF YOUR

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:17.366
ENROLLMENT IS HAPPENING AT A

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:21.137
TIME WHEN -- OVERALL SYSTEM

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:23.306
ROMAN IS -- IS STABLE AND IN

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:25.408
MANY COMMUNITIES DECLINING SO I

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.442
TAKE LINING UP.

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.410
WHAT'S THAT YEAH THE CLINIC AND

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:28.444
SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT I I

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:29.245
WOULD JUST SAY THE OTHER YOU

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.413
KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE GOALS

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.614
WAS CAPACITY.

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.649
ANOTHER GOAL HAS BEEN IMPROVING

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:35.518
THE QUALITY OF C. T. E. I THINK

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.620
THE MEASURES ARE MEASURES AROUND

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:40.022
EARNINGS AFTER A PROGRAM.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.357
ARE IMPORTANT WAY IN WHICH WE'RE

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.159
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ARE WE

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:45.228
IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF CG THAT

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:46.729
THE BUT SYSTEMS OFFERED TO

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:48.131
BASICALLY BACK TO THE ENROLLMENT

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:48.931
ISSUE.

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.600
BASE OF THE ARGUMENT OVER ALMOST

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.135
DROP AT CT ENROLLMENT IS UP

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.870
SLIGHTLY AS THAT YEAH THE GROWTH

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.905
FACTOR YET BY EIGHT BY PUSHING

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:56.772
THESE DOLLARS THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:59.208
INCREASING THE ENROLLMENT OR THE

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:00.676
OR THE NUMBER STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.178
ATTENDING C. T. PROGRAMS.

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:03.012
SPECIFICALLY SAME THING GOES

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.480
WITH FACILITIES TO THOSE

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:05.781
FACILITIES BENEFITS HE TV

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:07.917
PROGRAMS AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:10.453
A THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.387
COLLEGES AND IN INTO TWO CAMPS

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:17.627
CAN CAN THE STRONG WORK FORCE

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:19.729
DOLLARS BE USED FOR SALARIES.

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:21.631
YES THEY CAN WHAT WE DO THERE IS

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:22.465
THERE'S THERE'S RECOMMEND ONE

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:23.699
YEAR HOW DOES THAT WORK BECAUSE

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:24.433
OF THE PROGRAMS ON GOING.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.201
IT'S WE RECOMMEND TO COLLEGES

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:25.768
THAT BASED ON BEST PRACTICES

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.270
THAT THEY BECAUSE THIS IS A

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:28.504
CATEGORICAL.

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:30.273
THAT THEY SINK AND MULTIPLE

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.909
SOURCES TO TO SORT OF FUN THESE

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:35.745
POSITIONS -- ANOTHER WORDS.

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:38.014
NO MORE THAN 75% COMES OUT OF

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.749
ONE FUND RIGHT INTO FINDING A

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:40.950
POSITION SO THAT THEIR BRAIDING

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.552
FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:44.587
POSITION STAYS AROUND AS AS IT

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:45.922
GOES FORWARD.

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.790
SO I TYPES OF FLUCTUATIONS TO

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.125
THE TO THE DOLLARS TO HELP ME

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:50.359
UNDERSTAND HOW LONG IS A

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:51.794
REMAINING CATEGORICAL WHY WOULD

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:52.962
IT REMAIN ACCOUNTING OR WHY

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.763
WOULD TO BE.

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:55.464
BUILT INTO PART OF YOUR REGULAR

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:59.202
AN INSTRUCTIONAL FUNDING AT SOME

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.603
POINT WHEN IS IT FLIP.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.537
YEAH NO SO FROM THE STATE'S

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:02.071
PERSPECTIVE I I THINK BY

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:02.738
CATEGORICAL WE ARE JUST SAYING

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:04.106
FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.142
THIS FALLS OUTSIDE OF OUR

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.376
GENERAL PURPOSE OF FUNDING TO BE

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:09.445
ALLOCATED THE COLLEGES.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.681
I THINK ON A WIDER.

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:12.715
WELL THAT'S A NEW INCENTIVIZE

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.917
YOU TO DO IT I'M I'M I'M I'M I'M

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:15.751
LOOKING OF THE K. TWELVE MODEL

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:17.853
MONEY WISE AND THAT SAME THING

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.521
HERE.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:19.722
I THINK THAT INSTEAD OF EYES IT

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:20.656
GIVE YOU THE COUNTY.

01:04:20.723 --> 01:04:22.291
IT WAS FUNNY SOMEONE SAID THE

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:25.194
CHAIR NOTED CAPITAL OUTLAY WAS

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.063
31% ACTUALLY AS TOO LOW.

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:29.332
SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:30.600
YES THE END AND BY CATEGORICAL

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:31.801
MAYBE I'LL JUST SAY WE THE STATE

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:34.036
HAS RESTRICTED THIS TWO HUNDRED

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.538
FORTY EIGHT MILLION FOUR PER BY

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:37.840
KIND OF STRONG WORKFORCE CAREER

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.275
TECHNICAL EDUCATION PURPOSES.

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:40.710
DISTRICTS ON THE MONEY WE

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:42.345
ALLOCATE PART OF THE MONEY MOST

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:43.512
OF THE MONEY TO DISTRICTS SOME

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:44.847
OF THE MONEY TO REGIONS AND THE

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.415
REGION'S EVENTUALLY ALLOCATED TO

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:47.450
DISTRICTS.

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:48.551
WHEN IT GETS TO THE DISTRICT ARE

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:49.919
HOPING I THINK CHANCELLOR OAKLEY

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:51.587
HAS MENTIONED TO THE FIELD

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:52.989
MENTIONED HERE BEFORE OUR HOPE

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.423
IS THAT DISTRICTS ARE TAKING ALL

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:55.825
THE DOLLARS THEY'RE GETTING?

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.059
USING THEM TOWARDS A COORDINATED

01:04:57.126 --> 01:05:00.029
PROGRAM I THINK THAT CONCERNED --

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:01.731
OFTEN AT A DISTRICT LEVELS

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:03.132
AROUND THE RESTRICTIONS OF

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:05.034
FUNDING THE MAIN CONCERNS ABOUT

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.271
WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE -- TO

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:10.873
INKER LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS WITH

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.775
A DOLLARS LIKE THESE -- WHAT

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:14.310
THEIR EXPERIENCE HISTORICALLY

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:15.811
HAS BEEN USE DOLLARS CAN BE BOB

01:05:15.878 --> 01:05:18.581
THESE TYPES OF DOLLARS SET ASIDE --

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.316
APPROPRIATIONS IN THE BUDGET CAN

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:23.152
BE -- MORE VOLATILE LESS SECURE

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:24.620
THAN OTHER TYPES OF FUNDING

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:25.554
GREAT THANK YOU NOTE TO MAKE TWO

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:28.924
COMMENTS -- IN I DO WORRY ABOUT

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:30.059
THE CONSORTIUM ON ALL.

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:30.726
THE STUFF CENTERS THE CONSORTIUM

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:32.361
THIS.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:33.763
YOU KNOW THE SOVIET BLOCKING

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:34.897
GETS LOST AND THEN THERE'S YOU

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:36.465
KNOW TOO MUCH BUREAUCRATIC --

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:39.068
ACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS PAPERWORK

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:40.403
DECISIONS YOU MADE THEIR

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.038
POLITICAL DECISIONS INHERENTLY

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:43.339
IF YOU'RE IN A CONSORTIUM

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:44.006
COARSER BUT IT'LL YOU CAN'T TELL

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:44.674
ME THEY'RE NOT.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.109
RIGHT THERE IS GOING TO ADVOCATE

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:48.210
FOR THEIR OWN THEIR OWN BECAUSE

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:49.745
SO THAT'S JUST ONE CONCERN I ALL

01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:50.613
I ALSO HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.781
SYSTEM COLLEGE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:55.484
IS LOOKING AT BREAKING DOWN --

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:57.253
THE BARRIERS WITH REGARD.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.021
TO THE TIME ASSOCIATED TO

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.723
ACHIEVE A CERTIFICATE OR NAME

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.458
WHEN I MEAN BY THAT I MEAN THE

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:03.826
CAREER IN A YEAR APPROACH.

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:05.127
RIGHT DOWN THE SEMESTER THINKING.

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:06.162
SO THAT WE JUST KEEP GOING

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:07.730
THROUGH BECAUSE I MEAN THERE'S A

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.398
LOT THERE ARE SOME EVEN PRIVATE

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:10.399
INSTITUTIONS OTHER THAN OVER

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.500
PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT THAT DO IT

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:12.468
IN A MUCH.

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:14.270
QUICKER FASHION ALBEIT MUCH MORE

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:16.505
EXPENSIVE BUT IN A MUCH MORE

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:20.910
RAPID FASHION GETS YOU KNOW

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:21.477
THEIR STUDENTS INTO THE WORK

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:22.411
FORCE.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:23.346
BUT I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK YOU

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:24.080
KNOW STRONG WORKFORCE LIVES

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.381
ALONG WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:26.315
YOU KNOW EFFORTS THAT YOU KNOW

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:28.084
GUIDED PAHWAYS IS OUR WAY OF

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.185
THINKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU MAKE

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:29.685
SURE.

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:30.686
STUDENT COMES INTO THE

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.321
INSTITUTION WITH AN EDUCATIONAL

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:33.522
GOAL WE GET THAT STUDENT TO THAT

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.758
GOAL -- IN THE MOST EFFICIENT

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.493
WAY POSSIBLE -- YOU KNOW I THINK

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:38.427
WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:39.762
THINKING ABOUT APPRENTICESHIP

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:40.763
OTHER TYPES OF WORK BASED

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.431
LEARNING -- CREDIT FOR PRIOR

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:43.666
LEARNING SO THERE I THINK

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.501
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER WORK THAT

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:48.337
THIS -- HOPEFULLY WILL BECOME

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:49.638
MORE ALIGNED WITH MOVING FORWARD.

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.273
AND JUST ONE MORE QUESTION A

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.409
QUESTION WITH THE NEW -- FOR

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.911
FUNDING FORMULA IT'S NOT GOING

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:57.546
TO DISSUADE -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:06:57.613 --> 01:06:58.647
FROM SERVING THE STUDENTS WHO

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:00.416
DON'T WANT TO GET.

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:03.853
A NA OR DON'T WANT TO TRANSFER.

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:05.421
TO A TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY

01:07:05.488 --> 01:07:07.256
CORRECT THAT'S NOT THE INTENT

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:08.257
THE GOAL OF IN THE FUNDING

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:10.092
FORMULA THERE ARE MEASURES THAT

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:12.194
ARE SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT TRYING

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:13.596
TO TARGET THIS STUDENT CHURNING

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:14.730
IS HOW WE'VE KIND OF TALKED

THAT WE SET OUT THAT I THINK

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:39.013
MISTER O'DONNELL IS PROPOSING.

TO GO BACK TO IT TO A SINGULAR

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:52.526

THERE'S WHAT SIX HUNDRED AND

01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:15.716
EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- WAS

ADMINISTERING K. TWELVE DOLLARS --

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:36.804
AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING SOME

01:34:36.871 --> 01:34:38.506
EVIDENCE OF THAT NOW.

01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:40.207
SPLITTING THE THE K. TWELVE IN

01:34:40.274 --> 01:34:42.576

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:47.248

SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:49.984
IN TEACHERS SAY THE STRONG WORK

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:51.652
WORKS PROGRAM APPLICATIONS IS

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:53.187
APPLICATION PROCESS IS

01:34:53.254 --> 01:34:54.422
BURDENSOME.

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:56.023
TAKES EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:57.024
HOURS TO COMPLETE EACH

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:58.225
APPLICATION.

01:34:58.292 --> 01:34:59.360
AND THEN THERE'S A SEPARATE

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:03.164
APPLICATION REQUIRED FOR EACH

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:04.065
PATHWAY.

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:05.633
SO -- SIGNIFICANTLY BURDENSOME

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:06.233
APPLICATION PROCESS WHO WERE

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.301
HEARD ABOUT.

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:09.603
AND THE METRICS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:10.805
THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM ARE

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.006
GEARED TOWARD STUDENTS ATTENDING

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:16.343

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:22.616
SUCCESS.

01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:23.684
SO THERE'S A CHALLENGE AND

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.152
ELEAZAR REPORTING THAT THERE IS

01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:26.520
A LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THEIR

01:35:43.804 --> 01:35:45.272
UNLESS THE CAGE WALL PATHWAY

01:35:45.339 --> 01:35:47.141
FEEDS INTO THEIR OWN COMMUNITY

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:48.209

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:52.179
AN ISSUE -- AND AGAIN I I I

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:54.315

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:27.167
ALSO A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT.

01:38:27.234 --> 01:38:28.402
BY TARGETING ADDITIONAL FUNDS

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:29.436

IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS

ESPECIALLY THOSE STUDENTS AND

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:39.346
HIGH NEED AREAS AND TO SUPPORT

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:41.115
STUDENTS AT RISK OF ACQUIRING

RYAN ANDERSON ALEJO.

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:52.993
OF WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:53.927
LEGISLATURE REJECT THE

01:38:53.994 --> 01:38:54.862
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON THIS

01:38:54.928 --> 01:38:58.032
ISSUE AND ONE PRIMARY REASON WHY

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:58.999
IS THAT.

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:00.534
WE DON'T THINK THE DESIGN OF THE

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:02.703
PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THE

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:04.204
GOVERNOR STATED INTENT.

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:06.940
AS FINANCE JUST NOTED.

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:07.841
THEIR INTENT IS THAT THIS

01:39:07.908 --> 01:39:10.110
FUNDING BE USED FOR EITHER

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:11.612
SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES FOR

01:39:11.679 --> 01:39:13.013
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THOSE

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.782
BEING SERVICES THAT ARE NOT

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:16.684
CURRENTLY PROVIDED TO THOSE.

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:18.285
STUDENTS WERE FOR EARLY

01:39:18.352 --> 01:39:20.321
INTERVENTION EFFORTS WHICH WOULD

01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:22.956
BE -- EFFORTS OF SCREENING AND

01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:25.359
CHILDREN FOR BEHAVIORAL OR

01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:27.127
ACADEMIC CHALLENGES AND

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:28.495
PROVIDING THEM SOME SUPPORTS.

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:30.130
THAT WOULD DIVERT THEM FROM THE

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:32.533
NEED -- FOR BEING IDENTIFIED FOR

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:34.101
SPECIAL EDUCATION.

01:39:34.168 --> 01:39:35.903
NOW THAT'S THEIR INTENT AND

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:37.538
THERE IS SOME ASSOCIATED TRAILER

01:39:37.604 --> 01:39:39.273
BILL LANGUAGE THAT LIST THESE

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.909
PURPOSES BUT THE LANGUAGE ITSELF

01:39:41.975 --> 01:39:43.277
IS NOT CONTROLLING.

01:39:43.344 --> 01:39:44.578
A BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.013
WITH DISTRICTS WE THINK THAT THE

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.648
THE MESSAGE THEY WOULD RECEIVE

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:49.283
FROM THIS PROGRAM IS.

01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:51.352
IS -- FROM ITS TITLE SPECIAL

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:53.187
EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANTS

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:54.855
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE

01:39:54.922 --> 01:39:56.190
SAYING THAT RISING SPECIAL

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:58.826
EDUCATION COSTS ARE ONE OF THEIR

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:01.462
PRIMARY -- FISCAL CONCERNS AT

01:40:01.528 --> 01:40:03.230
THIS MOMENT -- THEY'RE ASKING

01:40:03.297 --> 01:40:04.098
SPECIFICALLY FOR MORE

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:05.833
CATEGORICAL FUNDING TO COVER

01:40:05.899 --> 01:40:07.534
THOSE EXISTING SERVICES AND WE

01:40:07.601 --> 01:40:10.404
BELIEVE THAT ABSENT CONTROLLING --

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:11.772
SPENDING RESTRICTIONS THEY WILL

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:13.307
INTERPRET THIS ADDITIONAL

01:40:13.374 --> 01:40:16.343
FUNDING AS FUNDING FOR THAT

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:17.544
PURPOSE.

01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:18.178
NAY IN ADDITION WE THINK THAT

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:19.947
THE ALLOCATION FORMULA THAT WAS

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:21.048
PROPOSED TO SPECIFICALLY

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:23.650
MISALIGNED WITH THE INTENT OF

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:25.219
REDUCING IDENTIFICATION.

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:26.687
OF STUDENTS FOR SPECIAL

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.756
EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:32.025
SO FEW STUDENTS WOULD QUALIFY

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:32.860
FOR THE FUNDING UNDER THAT

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:34.228
STUDENTS ARE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:37.097
PROPOSAL -- FOR EVERY STUDENT

CEASE TO IDENTIFY FOR SPECIAL

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:42.836

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:45.305

EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ON

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.541
GOING FUNDING THAT.

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:49.309
THAT SEEMS TO BE AS STRONG

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:52.746
FISCAL INCENTIVE NOT TO REDUCE

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:53.947
YOUR IDENTIFICATION RIGHT.

01:40:54.014 --> 01:40:55.182
NOW FINALLY IT BECAUSE WE THINK

01:40:55.249 --> 01:40:57.217
THAT THIS FUNDING WOULD BE USED

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:57.751

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:02.489
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE AS

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:04.691
SUPERIOR OPTIONS FOR ALLOCATING

01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:05.926

HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:28.148
THESE -- INEQUITIES ARE BASED.

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:30.150
WHOLLY ON A HISTORICAL FACTORS

THEY HAVE NO RATIONAL POLICY

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:34.188

LEGISLATURE.

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:36.990
A COULD DEDICATE SOME FUNDING TO

EQUALIZING THOSE RATES IN

01:41:38.525 --> 01:41:40.561
ADDITION -- THERE IS THIS

01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:42.162
DISCONNECT AS NOTED AND THE

PROCESSING APPLICATIONS THAT

02:16:22.807 --> 02:16:24.209

02:16:24.276 --> 02:16:25.443
PRODUCTIVITY REALLY SHOULD BE

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.345
BETTER THAN WHAT IT IS -- OUR

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:29.447

OF PROP FIFTY OF EXCUSE ME OF S.

02:16:33.618 --> 02:16:35.453

THE WAY THAT THEY DO THEIR JOB

02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:03.548
