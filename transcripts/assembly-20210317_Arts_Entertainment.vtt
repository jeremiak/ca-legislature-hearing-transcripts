RECREATIONAL CLUBS WORDS

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:15.933
ORGANIZE USE WORDS- AND THEN WE

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.134
ALSO WANTED TO HAVE CONSISTENCY

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:18.769
ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES LEVEL OUT

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:19.770
LOW MEDIUM AND HIGH RISK

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:22.540
CONTACTS WORDS- AND- SO ALSO

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:24.408
PUT FOR THE ADULT. RECREATIONAL

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:25.409
SPORTS AS PART OF THAT OVERALL

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:27.545
GUIDELINES- THESE GUIDELINES DO

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:30.081
NOT APPLY TO COLLEGIATE OR

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:31.782
PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. I DO WANNA

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:32.984
MENTION AS WELL JUST AS FAR AS

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.118
CONTACTS AND THEN THINKING

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:35.453
ABOUT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.188
HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE- WE'RE

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:38.656
WELL ON OUR WAY TO VACCINATION

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:40.391
A VERY EXCITING THAT WERE OVER

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:41.125
TWELVE MILLION DOSES IN

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:42.326
CALIFORNIA AND OVER FOUR

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:43.060
MILLION PEOPLE FULLY

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.862
VACCINATED. WE SHOULD KEEP IN

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.664
MIND THOUGH THAT THERE IS NOT

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:47.198
YET A PEDIATRIC APPROVED

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:50.835
VACCINE- WE DO KNOW THAT TWELVE

00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:51.435
TO SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE BEING

00:37:51.502 --> 00:37:53.137
ENROLLED IN TRIALS NOW I THINK

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:55.840
THAT THAT AGE RANGE TWELVE TO

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:56.440
SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS WE MAY HAVE

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:58.576
ACCION'S LATER THIS YEAR- BUT-

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:00.711
WE ARE JUST NOW. LITERALLY JUST

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:01.946
AND REPORTED YESTERDAY THE

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:04.315
FIRST TIME THAT KIDS UNDER THAN

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:05.950
TWELVE YEARS OLD. THEY'RE GOING

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.418
TO BEGIN TO DO TRIALS SO WE MAY

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.487
NOT SEE CHILDREN'S VACCINATED.

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:11.422
UNTIL YOU KNOW MUCH MUCH LATER

00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:13.691
IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR EARLY

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:14.525
TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO I THINK

00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:15.626
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IN

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:16.994
MINE AS WE THINK ABOUT THE

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:19.096
RISKS TO OUR CHILDREN. OF

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.297
ESPECIALLY HIGH RISK CONTACTS

00:38:20.364 --> 00:38:21.799
SPORTS THE OTHER THING I JUST

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:24.368
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- YOU KNOW ONE

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:25.369
OF THE RARE BUT REALLY

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:27.004
IMPORTANT INTEREST CONSEQUENCES

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:28.706
OF COVERT NINETEEN WELL AGAIN

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:31.308
MANY CHILDREN- YOU KNOW DON'T

00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:32.543
HAVE SERIOUS IMPACTS ARE CAN

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.445
HAVE. HAD NO SYMPTOMS AT ALL

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:35.212
WE'VE HAD THREE HUNDRED AND

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:37.314
EIGHTY CONFIRMED MULTI SYSTEM

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:38.716
INFLAMMATORY SYSTEM AND

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.785
CHILDREN CASES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:43.654
AND FOUR OF THOSE CHILDREN DIED

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:44.789
AND OVER HALF OF THEM WERE

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:46.123
ADMITTED TO THE INTENSIVE CARE

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.458
UNIT SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:49.794
LONG TERM OUTCOMES- AND SOME OF

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.861
THE MIDDLE LONG TERM IMPACTS

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:52.563
THAT WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.164
WE'RE PREVENTING WHEREVER WE

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.832
CAN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.834
HAVE THAT- ALSO TOP OF MIND AS

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.869
WE THINK ABOUT AGAIN WEIGHING

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:00.204
THE DIFFICULT DECISION THE

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:03.074
BOUNCES OF SPORTS- AND WHAT'S

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.009
WHAT YOU CAN DO. SAFELY AS FAR

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:06.343
AS PHYSICALLY DISTANCE MAKING

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.511
SURE PEOPLE WEARING FACE

00:39:07.578 --> 00:39:09.947
COVERINGS ALL THE TIME- LET'S

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:15.619
SEE A FEW OTHER COMMENTS- SO.

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:16.754
SPORTS THAT ARE. WE AGAIN THEM

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:17.788
INTO THE DIFFERENT CAT. AS FAR

00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:19.123
LOW MEET AND HIGH CONTACT. AND

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.825
THEN YOU CAN SEE BASED ON WHAT

00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:23.294
TEARS- WE HAVE DIFFERENT RULES

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.328
AND OUR OUR GUIDANCE IN THE

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.397
TABLE. AND IT'S AGAIN BASED ON

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:27.598
THE LEVEL CONTACT PARTICIPANTS

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:30.034
CAN HAVE WITH EACH OTHER. AND

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:30.568
ONE OF THE SPORT IS PLAYED

00:39:30.634 --> 00:39:32.103
INDOORS OR OUTDOORS. HOPEFULLY

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:33.037
YOU ALL AREHEARING OUR MESSAGE

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:34.538
IS LOUD AND CLEAR THAT ANYTHING

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:36.373
OUTDOORS AS MUCH LOWER RISK AND

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.708
THINGS THAT ARE INDOORS INDOORS

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:40.711
IS VERY HIGH RISK- CONDITIONING

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:42.146
PRACTICE FOR ALL SPORTS ARE

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:43.147
CONSIDERED LOW RISK IF THEY CAN

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:44.849
BE OUTSIDE AND- AND- PEOPLE

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:47.351
REMAIN DISTANCED- AND AGAIN

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:48.652
WEARING A MASK OR FACE

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.087
COVERING. INCLUDING DURING

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:51.355
CONDITIONING IS REALLY

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:52.890
IMPORTANT I KNOW EARLY ON.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:54.024
PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT IT'S

00:39:54.091 --> 00:39:55.359
DIFFICULT TO EXERCISE WEARING A

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:56.560
MASK I ACTUALLY WEAR A MASK NOW

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:58.028
WHEN I RUN AND I DO THINK

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:59.396
PEOPLE CAN GET USED TO THAT. SO

00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:00.965
EXCEPT FOR THINGS LIKE OUR

00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:01.999

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:37.954
OTHERWISE FORTIFY THEM DURING

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.622
TROUBLING TIMES MOST ATHLETES

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:40.990
DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THEIR LIVES

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.792
BEFORE SUPPORT IT'S ALSO

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:43.659
IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT

01:02:43.726 --> 01:02:45.261
EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCES IN ONE

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:46.529
AREA OF LIFE CAN AFFECT

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.131
MOTIVATION AND OTHER AREAS

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.799
INCREASES IN DEPRESSION AND

ANXIETY AS WELL AS GENERAL

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:53.202
REDUCTIONS IN WELL BEING HAVE

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.170
SPILLED OVER TO AFFECT

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:56.172
MOTIVATION IN ACADEMICS IN

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:57.740
OTHER AREAS OF FUNCTIONING. THE

01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:59.242

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.309
LEARNINGS ABOUT STUDENT ATHLETE

YOU EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU CAN'T

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.951
DELIVER FOR YOUR ATHLETES. AND

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.185
THAT'S BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:17.353
OF OUR RELENTLESSNESS IN THE

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.021
FACE OF SUCH UTTER EXHAUSTION.

ONE ATHLETICS AS A MEMBER OF

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.306
THE BIG WEST CONFERENCE- SO WE

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:13.442
SPONSOR TEN. FEMALE SPORTS IN

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:16.212

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:19.348
PANDEMIC AND THANKS TO MANY- WE

OUR SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:26.055
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AT CSUB.

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:28.591
SO TODAY I'LL FOCUS MY COMMENTS

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.993
AROUND. GENDER EQUITY WHICH I

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.562
KNOWS BEEN DISCUSSED- IN THE

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:36.732
FIRST ANALYST- BEST PRACTICES

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:37.633
THAT HAVE ALLOWED US TO

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.368
SUCCESSFULLY. RETURN OUR

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.337
ATHLETIC PROGRAMS TO TRAINING

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:43.472
AND COMPETITION AND THAT ALSO

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:45.141
SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IS

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:47.777
IN THE BEST INTEREST- FOR OUR

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:50.046
STUDENT ATHLETES. AND I DO

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.781
BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:52.648
UNDERSTAND ON THE FRONT END FOR

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:55.251
EVERYONE WHAT THE ROLE IS OF

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:58.754
THE NCAA. THE NCAA HAS FOCUSED

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.890
ITS ATTENTION TO PROVIDING

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:04.327
GUIDANCE SO NOT REQUIREMENTS-

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:05.528
AND THEY'VE ALSO PROVIDED

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:08.397
LEGISLATIVE RELIEF TO ROLES-

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:09.999
BETTER HELP THEIR MEMBER

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.268
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS- THOSE

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:13.402
STUDENT ATHLETES WHO DO NOT

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.404
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:18.240
OR THOSE THAT EVEN COMPETED. IN

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:21.177
THE FALL AND WINTER GOT AN

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:22.411
EXTRA YEAR OF ELIGIBILITY. SO

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:25.781
THE NCAA HAS PROVIDED.

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:28.417
REQUIREMENTS ONLY AROUND NCAA

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.653
CHAMPIONSHIPS. WHICH IS WHAT

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.988
THEY MANAGE- SO SORT OF LIKE

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:35.458
MARCH MADNESS- THE WRESTLING

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.493
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND STUFF LIKE

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.795
THAT THEY HAVE NOT PROVIDED-

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:42.531
MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS AROUND

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:44.967
REGULAR SEASON COMPETITION. SO

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:46.869
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE GENDER

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:49.405
EQUITY ONE CRITICAL AREA ARE

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.940
ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL AREAS

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:53.376
AROUND THE OPENING IS GENDER

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:55.611
EQUITY AND I CAN TELL YOU THE

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.314
FOCUS OF MY DISSERTATION-

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:00.449
RESEARCH WAS AROUND GENDER

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.551
EQUITY AND FEMALE STUDENT

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.520
ATHLETES SATISFACTION SO IT'S-

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.522
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT I AM-

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:08.457
PASSION ABOUT AND I'LL- DONE

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:10.760
SOME RESEARCH ON- IT WAS

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:12.128
PREVIOUSLY STATED BUT I'LL

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:13.763
REEMPHASIZE A LOT OF THE

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.765
ATTENTION SPECIFICALLY MEDIA

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:18.234
ATTENTION. HAS FOCUSED ON RE

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.069
OPENING OF FOOTBALL AND MEN'S

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:22.671
BASKETBALL- BUT I BELIEVE IT'S

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:24.840
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO KNOW

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:27.643
THAT THE NCAA SPONSORS THIRTY

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.212
EIGHT OTHER SPORTS WITH. TWENTY

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.180
ONE OF THOSE BEING FEMALE

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:32.815
SPORTS SO I BELIEVE IT'S

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.350
CRITICAL FOR LEADERS TO FOCUS

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:35.918
ON THE WELL BEING OF ALL

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.887
STUDENT ATHLETES. NOT JUST

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:39.255
THOSE THAT ARE OFTEN IN THE

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:41.724
MEDIA SPOTLIGHT. AND I DIDN'T

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:42.992
WANT TO GO OVER A FEW BEST

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:45.294
PRACTICES THAT I FEEL ARE

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:48.097
IMPORTANT ON GENDER EQUITY- ONE

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:49.932
IS MAKING SURE WHEN DECISIONS

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:51.634
ARE BEING MADE. THAT THERE'S

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.636
DIVERSITY IN QUITE SO SIMILAR

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:55.638
TO BRANDON AT USC WE HAVE AN

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.039
ATHLETICS COACH IN NINETEEN

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:59.542
ACTION TEAM WITH A WIDE VARIETY

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:01.444
OF MEMBERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:03.479
DECISIONS AND DISCUSSIONS.

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:05.014
INCLUDING MALE AND FEMALE

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.615
STUDENT ATHLETES ARE SENIOR

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:09.985
WOMAN ADMINISTRATOR- AND MANY

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:12.188
OTHERS. I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.622
WHILE THIS ISN'T THE ONLY PART

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:17.226
OF TITLE NINE. I BELIEVE- IT'S

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:18.727
CRITICAL THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:22.765
PARTICIPATION NUMBERS SO IF THE

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.633
PARTICIPATION NUMBERS AND AGAIN

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.502
IT'S A FEDERAL LAW. SHOULD

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.971
MATCH CLOSELY TO THE OVERALL

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:31.140
STUDENT POPULATION FOR INSTANCE

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:34.109
AT CSUB WE HAVE 61% OF OUR

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:35.211
GENERAL STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:38.113
FEMALE. SO WE LOOK TO MIMIC

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.449
THOSE PARTICIPATION NUMBERS

01:08:40.516 --> 01:08:42.585
WITH OUR STUDENT ATHLETES YOU

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.453
TOO ARE COMING BACK TO CAMPUS

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.056
COMMUNICATION IS CRITICAL AND I

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.225
KNOW THAT COULD BE EMPHASIZED-

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:52.528
OVER AND OVER ADVOCACY WE NEED

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.296
MORE PEOPLE JUST LIKE WITH THE

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.665
FAIR PLAY FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS.

01:08:56.732 --> 01:09:00.503
WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO SPEAK UP

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:01.136
TO ADDRESS INEQUITIES WHEN THEY

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.305
SEE. THE OTHER THING I WANTED

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:05.774
TO COVER IS- KEY INGREDIENTS TO

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.176
SUCCESS IN GETTING ATHLETICS

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.378
PROGRAMS BACK I DO BELIEVE

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:10.379
THERE ARE SOME CRITICAL AREAS

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:13.048
THEY'RE- SIMILAR TO BRANDON'S

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.984
EXPERIENCE AT USC. IT'S

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.585
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.687
MAJORITY OF CODE NINETEEN CASES

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:21.090
WE SAW. HAVE BEEN RELATED TO

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:23.726
ALL CAMPUS ACTIVITIES NOT ON

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:26.662
CAMPUS ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE NOT

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:27.229
BEEN ABLE TO TRACE ANYTHING

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:30.432
BACK TO. BOB ATTENTION OR

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:33.869
PRACTICES- AND THEN BRIEFLY THE

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:36.405
THREE KEY INGREDIENTS- THAT WE

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:38.474
HAVE FOUND TO BE SUCCESSFUL

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.876
CREATING A BUBBLE IS CLOSE TO

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.645

THAN THE FIRST TWO SPEAKERS AND

01:11:22.277 --> 01:11:23.946
THAT THERE ARE THERE ON CAMPUS-

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:25.347
THE THREE C. TWO A. OVERSEAS

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:26.382
COMMUNITY COLLEGE ATHLETICS

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:27.750
WOULD LIKE I SAID FOUR HUNDRED

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:29.084
AND TEN INSTITUTIONS. WE

WOMEN. NOW WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:35.624
CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT WE OVERSEE.

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.193
WE PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK- FOR

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.329
OUR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS- THAT'S

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:41.897
REALLY OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.299
PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK- TAKE THE

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:45.501
INFORMATION FROM THE IT

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.836
GUIDANCE. EXPLAINED THAT TO

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:50.906
THEN WORK WITH THEM- HAVE THEM.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.441
OBVIOUSLY KEEP IN TOUCH

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:55.477
IMMENSELY WITH THEIR HOUSE

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:55.944
THEIR COUNTY AND THEIR

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:57.513
DISTRICT. GET THEIR PLANS

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:58.814
APPROVED THINGS OF THAT NATURE

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:01.250
SO- WE'RE WE'RE COMING I'M

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.352
COMING OUT DIFFERENTLY THAN-

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.888
THAN- THE TWO PREVIOUS SPEAKERS

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:07.356
SO I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:09.625
FEW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE-

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.794
NCAA AND THE THREE C. TO ACT.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.062
AND THE REASON IS THAT I GET A

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.963
LOT OF QUESTIONS AS TO WHY

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.932
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WHY AREN'T WE

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.367
ARE NOT THERE YET AND WE ARE WE

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:19.735
WERE STARTING TO NOT COVER THAT

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:22.571
IN A SECOND- BUT THERE'S THERE

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.039
ARE SOME. FOUNDATIONAL

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:26.175
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:28.143
C. TWO A. AND THE NCAA AND THEN

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:29.678
OUR INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.947
INSTITUTIONS- I ALWAYS LIKE TO

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:32.981
SAY THAT THE THREE SEE TO IT IS

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.950
LIKE THE NCAA. BUT WITHOUT THE

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.852
MONEY WITH THE STAFF THERE ARE

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:38.020
SIX POSITIONS WERE CURRENTLY

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:40.723
HAVE FOUR FILLED- AND WE JUST

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:42.958
DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET- THAT

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.660
THAT THE NCAA DOES TO BE ABLE

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.295
TO PRODUCE ON THE LEVEL THAT

01:12:46.361 --> 01:12:48.063
THEY DO. OUR INSTITUTIONS

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.199
DIFFER OUR MOST OF OUR NCAA

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:52.534
COUNTERPARTS- BECAUSE WE MUST

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:53.936
TAKE FROM EXISTING RESOURCES TO

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.237
PAY FOR ATHLETICS WE DON'T

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:57.639
HAVE. LARGE GATES WE DON'T HAVE

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.508
TELEVISION CONTRACTS. WE DON'T

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:01.443
HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.946
HAVE A VERY SMALL STABS THE FEW

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:05.647
THAT DO MAYBE HAVE AN ASSISTANT

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.783
OR ASSOCIATE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:10.119
MAYBE ONE OR TWO- THERE'S JUST

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:11.954
NOT A LOT OF LOT OF BODIES

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:21.363
GOING AROUND- AND ALSO OUR- WE

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:22.631
DON'T HAVE- WE ALREADY STRUGGLE

01:13:22.698 --> 01:13:23.365
WITH. ENOUGH THAT'S WHY

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:24.700
TRAINERS WE HAVE A TRAINER WE

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:25.300
JUST TRY WITH HAVING ENOUGH OF

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:26.802
THEM AND THE PANDEMIC MADE OF

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.871
WORSE- BECAUSE A LOT OF THE

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.305
WIND RESPONSE OF. ABOUT AROUND

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:30.906
TESTING THE CLAY PRODUCTS AND

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:32.141
ALL. IT FALLS ON THEIR

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:35.277
SHOULDERS- AND SO. THAT'S

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:37.012
THAT'S JUST A PART OF WHAT WE

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.313
DEAL WITH EVERY DAY IN THE

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.617
OTHER PART OF THAT JOB. THAT

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:43.185
WAS MENTIONED IS NOT POSSIBLE

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.254
BEHIND. THEIR UNREALISTIC FOR

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.622
US BECAUSE ONLY TWELVE OUR

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:49.258
INSTITUTIONS HAVE DORMS- AND SO

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:51.393
WE HAVE A VERY. TRANSIENT IF

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.228
YOU WILL COMMUNITY- BECAUSE

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:54.496
WAIT WHERE THEY'RE COMING IN

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:55.898
FROM FROM ALL DIFFERENT PLACES

01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:58.934
AROUND. SO I MENTIONED THE

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:00.702
PROCESS WHERE THEY WOULD SPEAK

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:01.904
ABOUT THE PROCESS AND BASICALLY

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.272

JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.309
GENERALLY IN THE PANDEMIC. AND

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.977
THIS GROUP HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:10.846

ARE BACK TO NORMAL- WE DO HAVE

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:41.276
FISCAL CONCERNS- BUT BEFORE I

AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:56.992
TEAMS THAT ABOUT SAID THEY

APRIL SEVENTEENTH. THAT'S

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:06.668
ABOUT- SIXTEEN PER. OF WHAT WE

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:08.770
NORMALLY WOULD HAVE. AND THEN

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:10.339
FOR THE PRING WE HAVE SIXTY

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:12.608

CHANGE HER MIND OPT IN OPT OUT-

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:21.183

THAT'S- ABOUT 60% OF OUR TEAMS.

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:26.321
AND ROUGHLY GENERAC WE WISE

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.056

SEASON- SO. A FORTY GAME

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:46.275
BASEBALL SEASON WOULD BE

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:48.443
REDUCED 270% AND THAT'S WHAT

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:50.879

I DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING TOO

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:57.286
MANY TO HIT THAT NUMBER

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:59.788

IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE THAT WE

TESTING BY. ALL RIGHT THAT WAS

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:01.089
FROM ANYBODY ON THE PANEL NOW

01:26:01.155 --> 01:26:04.225
HOW DO WE DO THIS VIRTUALLY IF

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:05.994
WE'RE ASKING THE PANEL. THINK

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.496
ABOUT EACH OTHER YES WHY DON'T

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:13.067
WE GO AHEAD AND ASK. STILL BE

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:17.572
ON. ABSOLUTELY AND- SO WITH

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:19.240
RESPECT TO TESTING WE DO

01:26:19.307 --> 01:26:20.508
BELIEVE THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:23.011
THE RESOURCES FOR TESTING- FOR

01:26:23.077 --> 01:26:24.846
THE OUTDOOR SPORTS- ESPECIALLY

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.414
BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO BEING

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:27.215
ASSISTED TO THE STATE OF

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:29.050
CALIFORNIA- THROUGH THEIR

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:31.085
VALENCIA LABS AND BECAUSE THE

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:32.654
OUTDOOR SPORTS THE TESTING IS

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.455
ONE DAY PER WEEK I DO THINK OUR

01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:35.456
SCHOOLS ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:36.958
THATWE HAVE A MUCH GREATER

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.593
CONCERN AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.828
FOR GUIDANCE FOR INDOOR SPORTS

01:26:40.895 --> 01:26:42.330
THAT ARE UNDER THE INSTITUTE

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:43.565
FOR HIGHER EDUCATION GUIDANCE

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:45.133
WERE TESTING HAS TO BE ON A

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:47.168
MORE FREQUENT BASIS- THAT'S

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:48.736
WHERE OUR CONCERN LIES. WE

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:50.672
WOULD WE WOULD ADVOCATE THAT

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:52.407
BECAUSE OF THE AGE OF THE

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:53.474
STUDENT ATHLETES AND THE

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:55.343
TESTING IN THE EASE OF TESTING

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.911
FOR OUR SCHOOLS THAT FOR

01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:58.513
OUTDOOR IN ORDER SPORTS IT WAS

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.114
THE SAME CADENCE OF TESTING OF

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:04.252
ONE DAY A WEEK- SO THAT WE CAN

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:05.687
HAVE AN EQUITABLE RETURN. AND

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:09.924
AS DOCTOR CAN- SIX. ON STILL

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:13.194
LIKE TO MAYBE NO VISIT IS

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:15.296
OPINION TO THE QUEST. FOR

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:20.368
SECONDARY YES. I'M ON. SO- YEAH.

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:22.437
THE WANT ME TO REPEAT THAT ARE

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.472
YOU ARE YOU ARE OTHERS OPEN

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:26.040
FOR- SPORTS GARLING HAVE BEEN

01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:27.108
IN AN EGG AND THE QUESTION FOR

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:29.043
YOU ALSO AROUND TEN DO HAVE THE

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:34.215
AND RESOURCES. YEAH SO ALSO.

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:35.783
FIRST- I BELIEVE. THERE IS A-

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:38.820
VARIETY. OF AVAILABLE

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:41.656
RESOURCES. ON SCHOOL SO I CAN'T

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:45.259
I CAN SAY FOR US. WE'RE ABLE TO

01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:46.027
PROVIDE THE TESTING THERE'S A

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:49.330
LOT OF- RESOURCES OUT THERE

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:50.064
THAT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO HELP

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:52.967
US. SPARSE OTHER STATES.

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:54.235
PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:56.504
IS- CALIFORNIA IS BY FAR THE

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:59.340
MOST RESTRICTIVE- WHETHER

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:00.642
PEOPLE THINK THAT'S GOOD OR

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.844
BAD. IT'S THE MOST RESTRICTIVE

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:06.381
WHEN IT COMES TO- OPENING UP

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:10.084
FOR SPORTS- AND- REALLY IT

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:12.086
COMES DOWN TO CONTACT TRACING.

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:14.922
TESTING AND THEN BACKS NATIONS

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:16.958
AS FAR AS THE AREAS THAT. HAVE

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:22.296
BEEN BENEFICIAL FOR OPENING UP-

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:24.599
OTHER STATES. THANK YOU. THANK

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:26.734
YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:30.004
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. OKAY ONE

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:31.606
OF THE PANEL MEMBERS ARE CAN-

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:35.209
AND THIS QUESTION- ALSO

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:36.711
MENTORING IF YOU'RE CAN-

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:39.747
EXPLAINED TO ME- ARE THE IMPACT

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:42.884
OF THE STATE'S SUPPLIED LINES.

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:46.754
I'VE HAD A ON THOSE CHILDREN

01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:48.322
AFTER LEASE. WHERE THERE

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:51.192
COUNTERPARTS IN ORDER CITIES.

01:28:51.259 --> 01:28:56.731
HAVE A UP- QUICKER THAN A WAR

01:28:56.798 --> 01:29:01.969
OWN. ARE WE GO BACK TO DOCTOR

01:29:02.036 --> 01:29:03.871
KENNETH A SIXTEEN SINCE HE'S ON

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:06.708
THERE- THAT'S PROBABLY MORE OF

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:08.743
AN OPINION IN A QUICK ANSWER

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:10.378
BUT GO AHEAD AND LET US KNOW

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:12.880
WHAT YOU THINK OF OUR ATHLETES

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:16.884
COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. STILL

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:18.386
MY VIEW ON THAT IS. OUR STATE

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:20.588
GUIDANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:22.156
HELPFUL. BECAUSE I THINK

01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:24.025
THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION EVEN

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:26.427
NATIONALLY THAT THE NCAA IS

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:27.829
SETTING THE ROLE ALL THE

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:29.831
COLLEGES. AND THAT'S JUST NOT

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:32.133
THE CASE IT'S WE TAKE OUR STATE

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.901
GUIDANCE AND WE WORK VERY

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:35.870
CLOSELY WITH LOCAL PUBLIC

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.171
HEALTH- SO I BELIEVE

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:39.006
CALIFORNIA'S. AT THE HIGHEST

DO. USA BOXING HAS FIFTY SIX

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:44.257

01:47:44.324 --> 01:47:46.359
COMMITTEES FOR THEM IN THE

01:47:46.426 --> 01:47:48.261

HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:53.500
DOLLARS I THINK THAT'S

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:56.203
IMPORTANT AS WE HAVE BEEN

01:47:56.269 --> 01:47:58.238

WORKING WITH US BACKED UP

01:48:07.447 --> 01:48:10.016

OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS AND I

01:48:22.863 --> 01:48:25.398
THINK- THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO

01:48:25.465 --> 01:48:27.067
ATTENTION IS YOU KNOW

01:48:27.133 --> 01:48:28.768

BECAUSE IT'S- MORE ACCURATE OF

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:53.760
THE PILLARS AS WELL IF YOU LOOK

01:48:53.827 --> 01:48:55.228
AT OUR NUMBERS THAT WE DO HAVE.

01:48:55.295 --> 01:48:57.030

NEXT DAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED. AND

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:55.327
WE STARTED TO GROW BY THOUSANDS

02:03:55.394 --> 02:03:56.829
EVERY DAY- AND THEN WE

02:03:56.896 --> 02:03:58.931

VOICE- YOU KNOW IN OUR OPINION.

02:04:05.971 --> 02:04:07.840
KIDS WERE THE ONLY ONE THAT

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:10.276
DIDN'T GET TO RESTART.

02:04:10.342 --> 02:04:12.344
CRITICALLY EVERY INDUSTRY GOT A

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:14.013
CHANCE TO RE OPEN BUT- THE KIDS

02:04:14.079 --> 02:04:16.682
THAT- BY THE END OF JANUARY WE

02:04:16.749 --> 02:04:18.751
HAD GROWN TO OVER FIFTY

02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:20.119
THOUSAND MEMBERS. AND WHAT

02:04:20.186 --> 02:04:22.087
STARTED AS A L. AS A SMALL

02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:23.756
FACEBOOK PAGE BY TWO PEOPLE BUT

02:04:23.823 --> 02:04:25.791
NEVER EVEN DID FACEBOOK BUT-

02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:27.693
WE'LL WELL THE SUDDEN. I HAD A

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:30.362
MOVEMENT- OUR MISSION WAS VERY

02:04:30.429 --> 02:04:31.430
SIMPLE FROM THE BEGINNING AND

02:04:31.497 --> 02:04:33.232
IT REMAINS- AND IT REMAINS

02:04:33.299 --> 02:04:35.701
SIMPLE IT WAS- TO BRING BACK.

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:37.703
USE SPORTS TO CALIFORNIA-

02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:40.406
SAFELY AND IMMEDIATELY. AND I

02:04:40.472 --> 02:04:41.006
THINK WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT

02:04:41.073 --> 02:04:42.241
OUR ORGANIZATION AND I THINK

02:04:42.308 --> 02:04:43.943
WHAT WE'RE REALLY WORKED WELL

02:04:44.009 --> 02:04:44.810
AS WE WANTED TO DO IT THE RIGHT

02:04:44.877 --> 02:04:48.314
WAY- WE- WE DID NOT VIEW THIS

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:49.615
AS POLITICAL WE CERTAINLY

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:52.418
DIDN'T VIEW THIS AS- PARTISAN-

02:04:52.484 --> 02:04:53.686
WE HAVE STRICT STANDARDS IN

02:04:53.752 --> 02:04:54.854
TERMS OF MODERATING WHAT WAS

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:56.121
ALLOWED. AND WE ARE NOT A

02:04:56.188 --> 02:04:59.024
RECALL SITE AND WE KEPT ALL

02:04:59.091 --> 02:04:59.525
THAT OUT OF THAT BECAUSE

02:04:59.592 --> 02:05:01.427
BASICALLY. KIDS THAT ARE

02:05:01.493 --> 02:05:03.128
PLAYING SPORTS THEY JUST WANT

02:05:03.195 --> 02:05:04.096
TO PLAY SPORTS ARE NOT

02:05:04.163 --> 02:05:06.599
DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS- SO WE

02:05:06.665 --> 02:05:08.300
CAPTURE THAT MISSION AND IT WAS

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:09.768
DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO KEEP

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:10.336
FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:12.004
CURRENT. GOING IN THAT ROUTE

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:14.740
BUT I THINK THAT TRULY TRULY

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:16.842
HELPED US ACCOMPLISH OUR GOAL-

02:05:16.909 --> 02:05:18.510
SO HOW WE DID IT WE EMPLOYED A

02:05:18.577 --> 02:05:19.745
VARIETY OF STRATEGIES AND

02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:21.046
THERE'S THREE REFORMS OFF I'LL

02:05:21.113 --> 02:05:22.248
TALK ABOUT IS WHEN WE NEEDED TO

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:24.049
GET THE DATA. TO PROVE IT WAS

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:25.150
SAFE IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO

02:05:25.217 --> 02:05:26.919
OUR KIDS. TO WE NEED TO

02:05:26.986 --> 02:05:28.454
ORGANIZE TO BRING ATTENTION AND

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:30.122
LEVERAGE THE MEDIA TERMS OF OUR

02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:32.024
CAUSE. AND THREE WE ALSO HAD TO

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:33.692
GET SUPPORT FROM A VARIETY OF

02:05:33.759 --> 02:05:35.561
OTHER- RIGHTY EITHER

02:05:35.628 --> 02:05:37.496
ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:39.598
SO FROM A DATA STANDPOINT WE

02:05:39.665 --> 02:05:40.366
LOOKED INTERNALLY IN

02:05:40.432 --> 02:05:42.635
CALIFORNIA. WE LOOK AT THE-

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:44.503
SPORTS THAT WERE PRACTICING

02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:45.671
UNDER CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS

02:05:45.738 --> 02:05:46.939
IS COLDAND WE GOT A MILLION

02:05:47.006 --> 02:05:48.240
DATA POINTSTO SHOW THAT THE

02:05:48.307 --> 02:05:50.376

02:05:50.442 --> 02:05:51.877
TERMS OF CONTRACTING AND

02:05:51.944 --> 02:05:52.778
SPREADING COLD INTO THE LARGER

02:05:52.845 --> 02:05:54.747
COMMUNITY. WE WENT NATIONAL TO

02:05:54.813 --> 02:05:56.181
THE FORTY PLUS STATES AT THE

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:57.516

INDEPENDENT STUDIES- WE THEN

02:06:05.024 --> 02:06:06.125
TURNED OUR ATTENTION ONCE WE

02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:12.431
PROVE THAT WE CAN DO IT SAFELY.

02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:13.032
FOR YOU SPORTS WE LOOK AT THE

02:06:13.098 --> 02:06:13.599
MENTAL HEALTH SIDE. WE LOOK

TRAVELING OUT OF STATE THERE IS

02:06:18.137 --> 02:06:19.571
ONLY AND UTAH AND YOU NAME IT

02:06:19.638 --> 02:06:21.106
IN UNCONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS

02:06:21.173 --> 02:06:22.141
THAT. JUST DIDN'T MAKE ANY

02:06:22.207 --> 02:06:23.876
SENSE TO US. AND THERE'S ALSO A

02:06:23.943 --> 02:06:25.244
LOT OF CYBER CRIMES BEING.

02:06:25.311 --> 02:06:26.478
COMMITTED AGAINST OUR OUR OUR

DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SAN DIEGO

02:06:29.581 --> 02:06:30.983
IS A MEMBER OF OUR COSTS AND-

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:32.318
AND SHARE THAT INFORMATION

02:06:32.384 --> 02:06:34.119
WITH. WITH THE MEDIA ITSELF

02:06:34.186 --> 02:06:36.155
VERY ALARMING. SO I'VE WE'VE-

02:06:36.221 --> 02:06:37.690
GOT THE DATA WE ORGANIZED AS

02:06:37.756 --> 02:06:39.024
GROUPS AND WE DID THAT RIGHT

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:39.959
AWAY IS ONE OF THE MOST

02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:40.793
EFFECTIVE WAYS WE DID IT

02:06:40.859 --> 02:06:41.994
THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND

02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:43.929
RALLIES ACROSS THE STATE-

WHAT CAN WE BE ADVOCATING FOR

02:20:24.415 --> 02:20:26.084
AND DOING HERE IN THE

02:20:26.151 --> 02:20:29.053
LEGISLATURE- FOR STUDENT

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:32.357

QUESTIONS I HAVE I WAS THIRTY

02:20:59.217 --> 02:21:00.118
AND SOME TO MY HEAD AND THEN I

02:21:00.185 --> 02:21:01.286
THINK I LOST TRACK OF THEM LET

02:21:01.352 --> 02:21:03.254
ME START WITH THE LAST ONE IS

02:21:03.321 --> 02:21:05.456
THE UNDERSERVED UNDERSERVED

02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:06.457
COMMUNITIES RIGHT THAT'S A

02:21:06.524 --> 02:21:07.759
THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE AND THAT'S

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:08.660
WHAT LET THEM PLAY IS GOING TO

02:21:08.726 --> 02:21:10.762
BE FOCUS MOVING. FORWARD I CAN

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:11.629
TELL YOU THAT WE PARTNERED WITH

02:21:11.696 --> 02:21:14.866
CIS EXTENSIVELY- AS WE TRIED TO

02:21:14.933 --> 02:21:16.634
BRING BACK ALL USE FOR ITS FOR

02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:18.236
EVERYONE A LOT OF THAT HAD TO

02:21:18.303 --> 02:21:20.405
DO WITH THE TESTING. RIGHT

02:21:20.471 --> 02:21:22.574
BECAUSE WE KNEW TESTING WAS

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:24.108
GONNA GET FIGURED OUT BY THE

02:21:24.175 --> 02:21:25.777
HIGH SCHOOLS THAT COULD AFFORD.

02:21:25.844 --> 02:21:27.111
AND TESTING WASN'T GONNA GET

02:21:27.178 --> 02:21:29.214
FIGURED OUT BY INNER CITY AND

02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:31.149
SOMETIMES REMOTE OR OR LOWER

02:21:31.216 --> 02:21:34.219
ECONOMIC- THEY SCHOOLS- SO THE

02:21:34.285 --> 02:21:36.120
STATE UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT

02:21:36.187 --> 02:21:38.223
SUPPORTING- THE TESTING

02:21:38.289 --> 02:21:39.724
REQUIREMENTS OF INDOOR SPORTS

02:21:39.791 --> 02:21:41.526
THEY'RE ONLY DOING IT FOR

02:21:41.593 --> 02:21:43.294
OUTDOOR SPORTS WHAT WE WERE

02:21:43.361 --> 02:21:44.662
ABLE TO DO IS COME UP WITH A

02:21:44.729 --> 02:21:46.965
SOLUTION TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:50.034
OF NO CHARGE FOR ANY ATHLETES

02:21:50.101 --> 02:21:50.869
OR ANY SCHOOLS THAT ACTUALLY

02:21:50.935 --> 02:21:53.204
WAS MOBILE AND WOULD GO TO THEM

02:21:53.271 --> 02:21:54.706
SO THAT THAT WAS ONE OF OUR

02:21:54.772 --> 02:21:55.874
BIGGEST WAYS THAT WE WANTED TO

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.141
BRING BACK ALL THE U. SPORTS

02:21:57.208 --> 02:21:57.942
AND GIVE EVERYONE THE

02:21:58.009 --> 02:22:00.678
OPPORTUNITY WITH TESTING REALLY

02:22:00.745 --> 02:22:01.479
BEING THE BIGGEST BARRIER

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:04.649
THERE. IN TERMS OF ADVOCACY

02:22:04.716 --> 02:22:06.518
WHAT WHAT THE ATHLETES NEED

02:22:06.584 --> 02:22:07.485
RIGHT NOW IS THERE IS THERE

02:22:07.552 --> 02:22:09.487
SEVERAL DIFFERENT AREAS ONE IS

02:22:09.554 --> 02:22:11.890
TESTING REQUIREMENTS- FRANKLY

02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:14.692
THE STATE IS BASED ON A LOT OF

02:22:14.759 --> 02:22:16.561
THE PROTOCOLS AROUND TESTING

02:22:16.628 --> 02:22:18.563
NOT JUST OUTDOOR VERSES INDOOR.

02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:21.366
BUT FOR FALSE POSITIVES- AS

02:22:21.432 --> 02:22:22.967
WELL AS WHAT HAPPENS- WHAT WHEN

02:22:23.034 --> 02:22:25.236
SOMEBODY IS POSITIVE AND THE

02:22:25.303 --> 02:22:26.871
OTHER KIDS THAT THAT HAVE TO

02:22:26.938 --> 02:22:28.606
QUARANTINE OURS ARE THOSE RULES

02:22:28.673 --> 02:22:30.408
THE MOST- RULES MOST UP TO

02:22:30.475 --> 02:22:36.681
DATE- I THINK. I MAY ALREADY

02:22:36.748 --> 02:22:37.548
MENTIONED- CHEER. I A A A BIG

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:38.883
CONNECTED ISSUE- AND I THINK

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.818
THAT. YOU TO BE TO GO TO THAT

02:22:40.885 --> 02:22:43.054
THEN ALSO THE SPECTATORS SO IF

02:22:43.121 --> 02:22:44.522
YOU LOOK AT OUR PAGING YOU LOOK

02:22:44.589 --> 02:22:46.591
WHERE THE- CONCENTRATION IS AND

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:47.825
IT'S PRETTY SPIRITED I PROBABLY

02:22:47.892 --> 02:22:49.193
MORE SCARED THAN I'D LIKE.
