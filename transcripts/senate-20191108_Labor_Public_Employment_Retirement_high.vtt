PATIENTS. I HAVE NOT ALWAYS

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.778
BEEN ABLE TO BE TRUE ADEQUATELY

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.046
FOR SOME OF THESE CONNECTIONS

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.114
GIVEN OUR EGGS MEDICATIONS AND

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:38.084
SO THAT IS A- NEED ALWAYS TO

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.886

HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.427
MY MEDICAL OPINION- ANNA AND

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.228
IT'S BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE OF

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:50.063
THE CENTER FOR MEDICINAL

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.998
CANNABIS RESEARCH WHICH- AS TO

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.900
THE STATE OF. KNOWLEDGE ON

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.568
MEDICINAL CANNABIS AND

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.403
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE HELPFUL

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.473
IN INFORMING POLICY IN REGARD

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.809
TO AND ALSO EDUCATION. CLEARLY

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:06.479
THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL AREA.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:07.347
BUT THEY'RE IMPORTANT FACTS

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.916
THAT ARE URGING OF FIRSTLY

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:10.750
CENTER FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.286
RESEARCH ITSELF WAS ACTUALLY

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.822
ESTABLISHED BY LEGISLATION- OF

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:18.257
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:21.327
SB EIGHT FORCE OF AN A IN

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:24.797
NINETEEN NINETY NINE CENTS THE.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:28.001
SENATOR JOHN VASCONCELOS.

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:32.438
REGRET THIS PAST WAY WAS THE

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:33.039
AUTHOR OF THAT LEGISLATION SO

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.808
WE- IN TWO THOUSAND. THE CENTER

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:39.879
THE US SB EIGHT FORTY SEVEN WAS

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.482
REALLY ALSO TRIGGERED BY

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.050
PASSAGE OF PROP TWO FIFTEEN AND

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.185
I THINK MAY BE LEGISLATORS WERE

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.520
INTERESTED IN WHAT IS THE

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:51.290
SCIENCE IS THE EVIDENCE BASE

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:52.725
FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS AND SO

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.127
THAT WAS- THE- IMPETUS FOR

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:57.063
SETTING UP OR CENTER. SINCE

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.265
WE'VE BEEN A STAB LISTED WE ARE

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:01.467
COMPLETED- EIGHT SHORTER TERM

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:02.635
pSTUDIES ON DIFFERENT

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:06.639
CONDITIONS. AND ALL OF THESE-

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.107
AS IT TURNS OUT A SHOW THAT IN

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.643
THE SHORT TERM- MEDICINAL

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.844
CANNABIS WAS BENEFICIAL THE

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.080
CONDITIONS WE STUDIED. INCLUDED

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.650
NEUROPATHIC PAIN. NO PASSED THE

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.519
PAIN AS YOU MAY KNOW IS A

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:24.257
CHRONIC- OF HYPERSENSITIVITY.

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:26.526
ALL THE SERVERS- SYMPTOMS LIKE

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:29.996
TINGLING PAIN- RESPONDING TO A

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.565
LIGHT TOUCH IN AN EXAGGERATED

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:35.101
MANNER AND SO FORTH THE END

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.469
THIS IS THE KIND OF PAIN THAT'S

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.304
PRODUCED BY CERTAIN DISEASES

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.573
AND INJURIES INCLUDING HIV AIDS

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.710
DIABETES CERTAIN KINDS OF

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:47.413
PHYSICAL INJURIES. DURATION

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.951
SOMEWHERE EARLIER. IN THE

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.053
NEUROPATHIC PAIN THE REASON I

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.455
GO INTO A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.223
IS DIFFERENT THAN THE PAIN YOU

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.592
GET SAY AFTER SURGERY- WHERE

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.894
YOU HAVE A MORE SEVERE PAIN

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:02.628
IT'S VERY WELL MANAGED BY

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.298
OPIOIDS INITIALLY POTENTIALLY

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:09.168
OR NONSTEROIDAL ANTI

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:09.669
INFLAMMATORIES. BUT THE

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:10.837
NEUROPATHIC PAIN DOESN'T

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:14.373
RESPOND WELL TO. THINGS LIKE A

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.908
LOW DOSES OF ANTI DEPRESSANTS

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:17.910
AND- ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS THING

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:19.712
OF THAT NATURE TO MANAGE THE

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.147
HYPERSENSITIVITY AND IT TURNS

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.583
OUT. THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.119
ANIMAL RESEARCH AND ALSO

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:30.389
INFORMAL HUMAN- REPORT THAT. T.

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:33.559
H. C. PARTICULARLY WAS HELPFUL

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:34.994
SO THAT WAS THE REASON TO

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:38.064
STUDY- NOT PERFECT PARTICULAR

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:38.931
AND AS A SAY FOUND THAT IT IT

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:41.667
WAS USEFUL. IT WAS ABOUT AS

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:43.302
EFFECTIVE AS SOME OF THE

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.304
TRADITIONAL MEDICINES SUCH AS

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:47.673
GAP PENTON FOR EXAMPLE. ALSO

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.176
LOOK TO ADD MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:53.613
US SPASTICITY AS YOU KNOW I

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:54.213
MESS IS A CHRONIC NEUROLOGICAL

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.084
CONDITION. THE BEERS MUSCLES

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:58.651
LIMBS CAN BE A DEBILITATING

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.620
SYMPTOMS IN THIS THESE. AND

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:02.288
AGAIN AS WITH NEUROPATHIC PAIN

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.189
THERE ARE TREATMENTS BUT NOT A

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.792
REPAIRS FUNDS AND SO FORTH SO

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:08.127
AND HERE WE FOUND AGAIN AND ONE

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:08.928
OF OUR STUDIES THAT A TEACH C.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:11.964
CONTAINING. THIS PRODUCT WAS

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:15.168
HELPFUL. IT ACTUALLY ARE. OF

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:15.768
WHICH WERE PUBLISHED SOMETIME

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:19.806
AGO WERE MUCH ECHOED IN THE

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:21.941
MORE RECENT REPORT. YOU KNOW

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:26.312
FROM THE NATIONAL. ALBUM OF

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.813
SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:30.283
MEDICINE. HE SEVENTEEN REVIEWED

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.618
IN A MASSIVE AWAY ALL OF THE

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:35.021
DATA ABOUT THAT AND THEY REACH

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:36.789
THE CONCLUSION FACT IT'S THEIR

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.357
TERM THERE IS CONCLUSIVE

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.493
EVIDENCE THAT FOR CERTAIN

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.661
CONDITIONS LIKE NORA MATH YOUR

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:44.197
PATH MAIN OF SPASTICITY IN

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:47.200
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS A CONTROL

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.735
OF- CERTAIN SYMPTOMS OF WEIGHT

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:53.539
LOSS. AND NAUSEA THAT THERE WAS

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:55.441
PRETTY CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.109
OF THESE TASTY CONTAINING WERE

00:07:57.176 --> 00:08:01.881
USEFUL SO- I THINK THE DATA ARE

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.216
FAIRLY CLEAR ON THAT WHAT IS

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:06.385
UNCLEAR IS THE USEFULNESS IN

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:08.888
THE LONG TERM AND ALSO WHETHER

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:11.357
OR THERE ARE SUB GROUPS OF

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:13.025
PATIENTS WHERE WE NEED TO

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:16.095
EXERCISE GREATER CAUTION. WELL

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.064
FOR EXAMPLE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.933
MAY RESPOND TO- A TEACH THE

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.602
CONTAINING PRODUCT WITH MORE

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:25.037
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT OF OUR

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:29.876
PROBLEMS ALONG THOSE LINES THAT.

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:30.476
MIGHT A HEALTHY FORTY YEAR OLD

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:34.180
FOR EXAMPLE. ALL THE OTHER-

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:35.314
CANNABINOID THAT HAS BECOME

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.950
VERY- MUCH OF INTEREST IS

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.620
CANNABIDIOL. NO CANNABIDIOL IS

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:41.520
A NATURALLY OCCURRING

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:44.056
CANNABINOID IT IT IT'S FOUND IN

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:45.658
IN MARIJUANA THE DEPENDING ON

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:46.626
THE CULTIVARS THE PLANTS

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:48.728
THEMSELVES OF SOME PRODUCE

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:51.931
ALMOST NONE SOME PRODUCE A LOT

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:52.565
HAMPER FOR EXAMPLE IS BASICALLY

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.401
CAM. THE DIVA. MARIJUANA BUT IT

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.270
JUST DOESN'T PRODUCE THC IT

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:59.171
COULD BE ENGINEERED TO PRODUCE

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:01.007
IT BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO IN

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:03.709
A IN A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:06.178
SOSA CABA THEY ALL HAS- BEEN

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:08.314
THOUGHT OF BEING POTENTIALLY

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.682
FULL AS AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:11.751
DRUG AGAIN AN ANTIEPILEPTIC

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:15.388
DRUG. AND POTENTIALLY HAS OTHER

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:17.690
ACTIONS INCLUDING ANTIANXIETY.

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:21.494
ANY PSYCHOTIC ACTIONS SO THESE

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.128
ARE SOME OF THE AREAS THAT ARE

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:24.230
BEING EXPLORED. IN IN FACT

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:28.034
UNDER- THE CENTER FOR MEDICINAL

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.602
CANNABIS RESEARCH WHICH NOW

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:35.141
RECEIVES FUNDING- FROM PROP

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:39.946
SIXTY FOUR FOUR. A WE HAVE- NOW

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:41.080
OF SELECTED FIVE STUDIES GO

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:43.115
FORWARD- WITH THESE FUNDS TO IN

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:45.384
FACT STUDY OF THE POSSIBLE USE

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:46.852
OF CANNABIS. SCHIZOPHRENIA IN

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:51.157
ANOREXIA. SEVERE THIS IS A

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:51.791
WEIGHT LOSS CONDITION AFFECTING

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:54.961
PRIMARILY YOUNG WOMEN. IN

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:56.796
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WHICH IS

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:58.531
AN INFLAMMATORY CHRONIC

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:01.801
ARTHRITIC. CONDITION IT ALSO IN

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.703
INSOMNIA I DIDN'T MENTION THAT

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:07.006
EARLIER BUT OBVIOUSLY PROBLEMS

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.107
ARE AMONG THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:10.309
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE. HI AND

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.912
IT'S CLEAR THAT- BUT THE

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:15.848
REGULAR OR INCREASING USE OF-

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:17.350
CERTAIN KINDS OF SLEEPING PILLS

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:18.751
IS NOT A GREAT THING SOME

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.519
PEOPLE DO IT FINE BUT WITH SOME

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:21.887
PEOPLE BECOMES PROBLEMATIC AND

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:24.090
AGAIN THERE'S SOME SUGGESTION

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.225
THAT CANNABIDIOL WERE KIND OF A

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.160
DIAL IN COMBINATION VERY LOW

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:30.429
DOSES OF THC MAY BE HELPFUL IN

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:33.499
SLEEP PROBLEMS AND MAY BE LESS

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:36.135
PROBLEMATIC. IN THE LONG TERM.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:36.602
THE OTHER AREA THAT'S

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:39.372
IMPORTANT. AND VERY TIMELY NOW

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:41.607
IS THE- POSSIBILITY THAT

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:42.908
CANNABINOIDS MAY HAVE AN OPIOID

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.745
SPARING EFFECT WITH THE

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:46.812
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:51.217
WITH- OPIOID OVERDOSES. AND

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:52.718
EITHER OVER PRESCRIPTION OR

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:55.388
ILLICIT USE OF BOYS- THERE IS

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:57.056
AN INTEREST AND SOME DATA TO

00:10:57.123 --> 00:11:00.292
SUGGEST THAT THE COMBINATION OF

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.628
CANNABINOIDS WITH VOIGTS

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:04.330
ACTUALLY REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:05.664
OPIOID THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:07.333
PRESCRIBED OR MILLION IN FACT

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.502
EVEN SUBSTITUTE FOR THE

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:10.936
OPIOIDS. BUT IT'S A

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:12.304
SCIENTIFICALLY OPEN QUESTION AS

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:13.472
A SAY THERE SOME DATA BUT

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:15.408
THAT'S I THINK AN EXCITING

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:16.175
DIRECT THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:19.678
EXPLORED. WELL I'VE TALKED

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:22.948
ABOUT SOME. BUT IN SOME

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:23.949
BENEFITS SO IT WOULD BE REMISS

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.451
NOT TO TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS AS

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.653
WELL- IN AND SOME OF THE

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.091
PROBLEMS- THAT- THAT CAN OCCUR-

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:35.294
ARE OF COURSE. IF A CANNABINOID

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:38.230
CONTAINS THC PARTICULARLY IT

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:41.133
MAY IMPAIR MEMORY COORDINATION

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.836
JUDGMENT- ALERTNESS VARIOUS

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:44.570
THINGS LIKE THAT DEPENDING ON

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.505
THE DOSE OF THE US TO FIX OF

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:48.808
THE PERSON HOW THEY HANDLE IT.

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:50.376
SO THESE CAN BE PROBLEMATIC

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:52.144
AREAS OF WATER THERE ARE

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.214
STUDIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN- DO

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.148
IT IS JUST COMPLETE IS

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:58.384
ACTUALLY- STUDY ALL OUR HOME

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.252
THE EFFECTS ON DRIVING. IN

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:02.655
PEOPLE WHO USE DIFFERENT. NOT

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:04.623
USE BUT ARE GIVEN ACTUALLY IN A

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.759
LABORATORY SETTING A DIFFERENT

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:08.727
CONCENTRATIONS OF THC

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:11.697
CONTAINING PRODUCT AND SO- THAT

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:16.435
WAS- UNDER- AB TWO SIXTY SIX

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:17.837
ACTUALLY- MISTER LACKEYS

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.939
LEGISLATION THAT OF THE SYSTEM.

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:22.374
SO WE ARE ARE LOOKING FORWARD

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:23.976
TO THE RESULTS OF THAT- AND

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:26.712
PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT- WHAT

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.482
KINDS OF IMPROVE BEHAVIORAL AND

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:31.283
ROADSIDE TESTING MAY BE.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.855
APPLICABLE BY CHP OFFICERS OR

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:40.392
WHOEVER OF. THAT MAY GO BEYOND

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:45.164
WHAT WE DO NOW. NOT ONE OF THE

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:45.664
THINGS I KNOW THAT'S OF

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.933
INTEREST TO THIS GROUP IS. WELL

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.501
WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON THE-

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:49.401
EMPLOYEE IF SOMEBODY HAS A

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:52.071
CHRONIC CONDITION. ARMED AND TO

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.373
ME- ONE ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.842
ADDRESSED FULL ON IS OF THE

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:58.377
ISSUE OF CHEMICAL TESTING AND

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.613
WHETHER THE CHEMICAL TESTING

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:04.016
CAN BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR IF YOU

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.885
WILL BEHAVIORAL TESTING OF THE

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:09.488
EMPLOYEE. OF THE DIFFERENCE IN-

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.724
CANNABINOID CHEMISTRY OR

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.426
PHARMACOLOGY IS THAT JUST

00:13:14.493 --> 00:13:16.662
BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS SOME SAY H.

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:18.964
C. IN THEIR SYSTEM. DOESN'T

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.099
NECESSARILY MEAN THEY'RE

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.834
IMPAIRED AND DOESN'T TELL YOU

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:24.503
MUCH ABOUT WHEN THEY TOOK IT-

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.406
AND SO- USING A KIND OF PER SE

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:30.476
APPROACH. IT IS NOT A USEFUL

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.178
THING AND WE HAVE FOUND THIS

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:32.745
THROUGH THE DRIVING STUDIES

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:34.246
THAT ACTUALLY DRIVING

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.715
IMPAIRMENT CORRELATED POORLY

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:38.951
WITH TWO WITH A BLOOD LEVELS

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:41.086
AND SO LIVE AND BREATH LOVELL'S

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:44.623
ON CANNABINOIDS. SO WAS THE ONE

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.792
THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN MY

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:49.895
JUDGMENT IS IN THE EMPLOYEE.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:52.531
PLEASE TESTING SOMEBODY- MAY OR

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:54.700
MAY NOT TELL YOU IF THEM HE IS

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:58.204
ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO THERE. AND

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:58.771
IN FACT SOMETIMES ONE MIGHT

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:03.108
REACH THE WRONG CONCLUSION. SO

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:04.343
I THINK THAT I'D LIKE TO

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.145
SUMMARIZE BECAUSE I'M FROM SURE

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:08.847
TIME IS SHORT THE BUT AND I DO

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:10.549
HAVE THE STATEMENT WHICH

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:12.518
LOGICAL BUT YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:16.121
AT. A BUT I WOULD OFFER THE

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.790
FOLLOWING OF THE THINGS FOR

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:21.126
CONSIDERATION. WE WILL BENEFIT

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.829
OUR PATIENTS SCHERING THAT

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:24.396
PHYSICIANS AND OTHER MEDICAL

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:27.566
STE. RECEIVE EDUCATION FIRST ON

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:28.067
THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:30.569
MEDICINAL ALKALOIDS AS WELL AS

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:31.537
THEIR SIDE EFFECTS AND POSSIBLE

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:33.872
HARMS. INCLUDING WHAT REMAINS

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:37.409
UNKNOWN. OF THE IT SHOULD BE

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:38.277
ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR MAIN MANY

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:41.947
SUCH UNKNOWNS. GIVEN THE STILL

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:42.548
EVOLVING FIELD OF CANNABINOID

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:45.150
SEARCH. WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.052
HEALTH PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:47.519
UNBIASED AUTHORITATIVE

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:51.323
INFORMATION. ON PATIENT ON A

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:51.790
MEDICINAL CANNABIS AND

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:54.460
CANNABINOID. IF THE PATIENT'S

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:57.296
CONDITION OF MAYBE BENEFITTED

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:57.863
BASED ON THE SCIENCE THAT'S

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:03.636
EMERGING. OF WE ALSO WOULD- PUT

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.271
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THAT

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.373
PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE MEDICINAL

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.007
CANNABIS IN A MANNER COMPLIANCE

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:10.209
WITH STATE. SHOULD NOT BE

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.811
SUBJECTED TO ANY ADVERSE ACTION

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:14.246
IN REGARD TO THEIR EMPLOYMENT

BOARD WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.124
PROTOCOLS AND DECISION TREES

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.659
GOT THIS CANNABIS AND

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:28.560
CANNABINOID ADMINISTRATION

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:31.297
BASED ON THE EMERGING SCIENCE

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:33.832
I'M I'D SAY WE'VE BEEN WORKING

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:34.433
WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD ALREADY

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.236
ON THEM. FINAL THAT EMPLOYERS

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:37.703
AND THOSE IN CHARGE OF

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.039
EDUCATIONAL ISSUE. SHOULD

RECEIVE INFORMATION ON HOW TO

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:45.044
ACCOMMODATE EMPLOYEE STUDENTS

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.245
WITH WOULD THAT NEEDS FOR

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:46.812
MEDICINAL CANNABIS IN THEIR

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:50.482
PLACES OF. SPECIFICALLY

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:51.417
EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS WHO

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:53.952
RECEIVE A DISCOUNT SHOULD NOT

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:55.521
BE JUDGED TO BE IMPAIRED OR

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:58.057
UNQUALIFIED BASED ONLY ON

00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:00.025
CHEMICAL TESTS. BUT INSTEAD

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:01.794
SHOULD BE EVALUATED BASED ON

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.495
BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:06.432
RELEVANT TO THEIR OCCUPATION BE

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:06.965
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO WITH

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.401
AIRLINE PILOTS FOR EXAMPLE. WE

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.002
TEST WHETHER THEY CAN ACTUALLY

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:14.073
DO THE JOB. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.741
ATTENTION ONE ZERO THANK YOU

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:27.019
DO WELL. BEFORE WE GO ON A

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:27.586
JUST. A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.254
COMPARE THE MIND IN A- NOTICE

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:32.324
THE TERM I HAVE A- ARTICLE FROM

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:35.627
COVENTRY REGENERATIVE. AT THE

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:37.396
COMPANY I GET RID OF THE NATION

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:41.467
OF THAT NATURE TALK. THIS IN

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:43.168
THE TREATMENT OF SOME DIFFERENT.

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:46.538
ELEMENTS TALKS ABOUT THE

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.073
NEUROPATHIC PAIN AND AN AGREED

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.842
WITH THAT BUT I GUESS TO DO

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.009
GOING TO YOUR POINT THAT A LOT

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:54.113
OF THIS IS STILL UNCLEAR. TO

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:56.648
SOME OF THE BENEFITS EIGHT.

00:16:56.715 --> 00:17:00.719
STATE THAT THERE ARE. SURE WELL

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:03.122
CANNELLA WOODS- IS IN MULTIPLE

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:05.791
SCLEROSIS RELATED TREMORS AND

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.760
THAT SO IT WOULD I GUESS WHAT

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:08.994
I'M IN OF THE TAKE AWAY FOR ME

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:11.296
ISN'T THERE STILL SOME

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.965
CONTROVERSY OR DISCUSSION FOR

00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:15.234
WHAT ACTUAL OR DERIVED FROM

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.905
SOME OF THESE CANNABIS PRODUCTS

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:20.406
AND I THINK YOU SURE YOU

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:22.207
MENTIONED THAT IN YOUR- YOUR

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:22.775
PRESENTATION. THAT'S CORRECT

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:26.612
THE FIELD IS THE- I THINK THE-

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.347
AS OF ABOUT A YEAR AGO THE MOST

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:30.549
AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENT IS THIS

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:31.984
NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORT BUT

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.919
AS THEY SAY IT'S THOUSANDS OF

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:36.021
PAGE ACTUALLY BUT IT'S ALSO

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:38.023
SUMMARIZED IN IN IN VERY NICE

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.993
ABSTRACT THAT EACH SECTION. AND

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:42.928
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:43.495
FOR NEUROPATHIC PAIN AND FOR

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:47.065
MUST PULL. SPASTICITY I DON'T

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:48.233
KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN BY TREMORS

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.868
THAT'S ANOTHER SITUATION

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:51.970
WHETHER OF TREMORS ARE BENEFIT

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:52.938
I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:55.174
BEEN STUDIED SUFFICIENTLY BUT

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.309
FOR SPASTICITY MASS THERE'S

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:58.610
VERY GOOD EVIDENCE NOW I

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:00.179
BELIEVE. WE ARE ACTUALLY

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:02.014
CONDUCT. THE ON SOMETHING

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.482
CALLED ESSENTIAL TREMOR WHICH

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.184
IS A CONDITION. MAY AFFECT

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.653
OLDER PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.888
ERROR A PRODUCT CONTAINING CB

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.557
DE HELLO BUT IF THC IS BEING

00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:16.462
TESTED BY ONE ROGER SO WE MAY

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:17.062
GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ON A

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:19.998
LEASE THAT TYPE OF TREMOR. I

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:21.266
THINK IN THE OTHER AREAS THE

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:23.769
FIELD IS EVOLVING THAT'S TRUE.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:27.606
OF AND- MORE WELL WHAT CAN YOU

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:28.207
EXPECT THE SCIENTISTS SAY MORE

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:28.774
RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE OF

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:37.850
COURSE. NATURALLY. WHAT DO YOU

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:39.151
DO FOR A I DIDN'T MEAN TO ABOUT

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:40.152
FACE YOU'RE HERE YEAH AND DO

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:40.752
YOU FEEL THAT THE OF

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.754
UTILIZATION OF LOCAL MARIJUANA

WITHIN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:47.926
TIM COULD REDUCE THE USE OF- IN

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:52.831
PAIN KILLERS. YES. I THINK IT

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:53.632
COULD AND IF IT THERE I THINK

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:55.267
IT COULD I CAN SAY THAT WITH

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:55.834
CERTAINTY. BUT CERTAINLY THE

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:58.837

MEASURE ACTUAL JOB FITNESS OR

00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:48.460
IMPAIRMENT. THIS IS BECAUSE

00:23:48.527 --> 00:23:49.494
THEY DETECT NON ACTIVE

00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:51.163
METABOLITES THAT RESIDE IN THE

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:57.502
FTA STUDY HAS EVER SHOWN THAT

00:23:57.569 --> 00:23:58.637

IMPROVING. SAFETY. IN GENERAL

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:04.743
STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.011
ALLOW LEGAL USE OF MARIJUANA

00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:08.213
TEND TO HAVE LOWER RATES OF

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:08.747
WORKPLACE FATALITIES THAN

PROHIBITIONISTS STATES.

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:12.284
SCIENTIFIC REVIEWS HAVE NOT

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.585
FOUND ANY GOOD EVIDENCE THE

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:15.187
CANNABIS IS ASSOCIATE PATIENT-

00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:17.756
INJURIES AND STUDIES HAVE EVEN

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:19.057
SUGGESTED THAT WORKERS WHO

00:24:19.124 --> 00:24:21.059
TESTED POSITIVE CANNABIS WERE

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.127
LESS LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:24.229
WORKPLACE ACCIDENTS OF A TOP.

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:28.433
THEN THOSE WHO TESTED DRUG FREE.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.568
BETTER LTERNATIVES URINE

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:30.569
TESTING EXISTS FOR JOBS

00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:32.270
INVOLVING HIGHLY ST CENTURY

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:35.140
LIVES SITUATIONS. SUCH TESTS

00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:36.575
HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF DETECTING

SWITCHED TO THIS KIND OF

ALTERNATIVE TO BURN TEST COULD

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:54.893
BE ORAL BOB A BREATH TEST NOW

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:02.334
GRANT POINTED OUT THERE ARE

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:02.801
SOME ISSUES WITH THAT

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:03.268
CORRELATING THAT WITH

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:09.975
IMPAIRMENT. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:12.210
ARE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:13.745
CURRENT OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:15.347
CALIFORNIA SHOULD EXTEND FEE

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:16.781
HOW WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS TO

00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:18.650
GRANT MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENTS

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.852

COMPENSATION LAWS AND

00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:26.992
REGULATIONS SHOULD BE AMENDED

00:25:27.058 --> 00:25:28.193
TO ALLOW CAN FOR CHRONIC PAIN

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.263

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.535
ALSO BàN URINE TESTING OR

EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.646
LAW. WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE AND

00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:49.147
DEVELOP PERFORMANCE TESTING AND

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:53.151
POSSIBLY ORAL. REST TESTING OF

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:53.718
THE ALTERNATIVES FOR SAFETY

SENSE SESSIONS. SO THIS IS A

00:25:55.553 --> 00:26:00.525
VERY. FOR MUCH A SUMMARY OF THE

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:03.595
DATA I HAVE I A ARE ALSO ALWAYS

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:04.195

THE. THE MAIN TAKE AWAY FOR ME

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:20.845
IS OR THERE'S. NO SOLUTION. IS

00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:23.048
GREAT IS THE SOLUTION FEDERAL

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:23.581
GOVERNMENT CHANGING THEIR

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:27.519
POLICIES AND. FOR CALLING FOR

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:28.153
ANY THIS ITS TRUE L. ACROSS THE

BOARD IN. I WANNA SURE. YOU

00:26:32.924 --> 00:26:33.825
KNOW OF THE STATE'S OF THE

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:34.859
LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY RIGHT

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:36.594
NOW A LOT OF STATES ARE MOVING

00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:39.998
FORWARD WITH IT AND WITHOUT THE

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:40.765
DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS FROM WHAT

00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:42.834
WE'VE SEEN IN THE STUDY SO FAR.

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:45.637
AND YOU SEE THAT THE TESTING.

00:26:45.704 --> 00:26:46.871
THE WORKPLACE TESTING LIKE A-

00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:48.640
AND I'M NOT AWARE OF THE- THE

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:49.975
CHALLENGES THAT EMPLOYEES ARE

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:52.510
FACED WITH- AND HAVE BEEN IN

00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:54.145
THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY IN THE

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:54.779
STATISTICS CERTAINLY POINT THAT

00:26:54.846 --> 00:26:59.417
OUT. HAVE YOU FOUND THAT THE.

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:02.754
USE OF THAT OF TESTING AND

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:05.056
THERE IS A WAY OF TESTING THAT

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:08.360
DISH THE WITH THE SWAB AND THE

00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:10.962
BLOOD WHATEVER IS THE SWAB TEST

00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:15.033
WHICH WOULD INDICATE THE THC

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:15.600
LEVELS RATHER THAN THE- LONG

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:20.772
TERM. TWO WEEKS AFTER- AND YOU

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:21.339
CAN TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:23.608
THE TWO YEAH THIS IS A SHOWN

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:24.242
PROMISE IT POSSIBLE. TO DO THAT

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:26.778
BUT- DR GRANT POINTS OUT IN THE

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.613
STUDIES ARE BEING YOU KNOW

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.516
DEPENDING PERSONS. THE AIR WAS

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:33.084
CANNABIS AND STUFF IN THE

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:34.753
DISTANCE THAT THEY'RE USING AND

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:35.987
STUFF IT MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY

00:27:36.054 --> 00:27:38.056
CORRESPOND TO THEIR IMPAIRMENT

00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:39.524
IT ALSO DOESN'T WORK IF YOU

00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:42.460
TAKE IT ORALLY. IRONICALLY

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:43.762
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE SMOKE IN

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:46.798
YOUR MOUTH SO- WITH REALLY

00:27:46.865 --> 00:27:48.066
THINK FOCUS SHOULD BE ON

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:49.934
PERFORMANCE TESTING OR THE TYPE

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:52.337
OF YOU KNOW WHAT THE AIRLINE

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:54.439
PILOTS DO IS DR GRANT SAID

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.074
BECAUSE AGAIN THAT COULD PICK

00:27:56.141 --> 00:27:58.510
UP YOU MIGHT BE OF FIFTEEN YOU

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:00.178
MIGHT BE EMOTIONALLY STRESSED

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:01.012
AND SO IF THE CONCERN IS

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:03.181
ACTUALLY WORKPLACE SAFETY. THEN

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:06.684
WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:07.285
PERFORMANCE TESTING INSTEAD OF

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:12.624
CHEMICAL TESTING. VERY GOOD

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:19.497
INTERESTING. DO I FOR YOUR

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:20.331
PREVIOUS FIVE AS I SIT HERE IN

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:21.766

A CULTURAL ISSUE AROUND I'M

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:29.374
BIASED AGAINST THE PRODUCT

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:33.745
FUNDAMENTALLY. YOU I MEAN

CAN CAN YOUTO A TO A TECH TO

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.259
ATTACK. APPROACH FROM RATIONAL

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:50.028
PERSPECTIVE BUT IS IT REALLY

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:50.962
JUST A FUNDAENTALLY A

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:53.031
FUNDAMENTAL CULTURE SHIA- WHERE

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.632
THERE'S A BIAS AGAINST THE

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:57.135
PRODUCT YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:58.236
UNFORTUNATELY PRESCRIPTION

00:28:58.303 --> 00:29:04.109
DRUGS. THAT CAN HAVE MUCH MORE

00:29:04.175 --> 00:29:04.676
VERSE IMPACT IN THE HISTORIC

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:09.414
BUT AT HIS DOOR. HOLD TWO MEN

THOSE ARE DEEMED ACCEPTABLE.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.654
USING THE TERM LOOSELY- BUT I

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:17.489
GUESS I JUST IT MAKES ME AS I

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.691

THE IF THE CONCERN IS

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:26.131
LEGITIMATELY SAFETY. THE TEST

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:27.465
WERE TESTING FOR THE WRONG

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:30.602
THING YES I THINK IT'S GIVE

BIGGEST THREAT NOW. EXPERIMENT

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:13.624
CANNABIS BUT IS TO WORKERS

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.992
THOSE WORKERS AREN'T PART OF A

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:16.260
UNION THERE ARE THAT

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:16.793
OPPORTUNITY THEY DON'T GET

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.462

WITH WHOLE WITHHOLDINGS TAKEN

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:23.834
CARE OF FOR THEM. A REAL

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.368
DISADVANTAGE JUST ON THAT

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:27.871
FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE BUT.

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:28.372
SAFETY I'M WORKING THOSE

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:31.441
ILLEGAL BUSINESSES ARE OVERALL

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:32.876
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS TO

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.878
HANDLE ILLEGAL MARKET THAT'S

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:35.479
WHAT AND THE PROBLEM IS ABOUT

00:48:35.545 --> 00:48:37.447
HAVE IT ALL THE REGULATED. THAN

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:39.816
THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE A LEVEL

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:42.452
PLAYING FIELD WHERE CANNABIS

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:43.053
BUSINESSES THAT HAVE A HARDER

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.456
TIME. YES WHEN I. WE SHOULD

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:47.090
HAVE BURDENS PUT ON US THAT ON

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:48.158
ON OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE

00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:48.859
THAT ARE LEGAL AND LEGITIMATE

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:50.060
AS WELL. AND THAT WILL HELP THE

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:51.495
STIGMA ATTACHED TO STIGMATIZE

00:48:51.561 --> 00:48:52.062
INDUSTRY AS WE TALK ABOUT IN

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:52.629
SOME OF THE EARLIER COMMENTS

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:56.800
TODAY. SO IMPORTANT. I DO THINK

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:57.768
IS RUSHING TO THE PRESENTATION

00:48:57.834 --> 00:48:59.069
FROM NORMAL. WE HAVE A DELIVERY

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:00.337
BUSINESS WE HAVE WE'VE CREATED

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:01.805
I THINK SIXTY. JOBS IN LAKE

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:04.308
COUNTY. I'M THE POOL WANTED TO

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:04.908
POOREST COUNTY IN THE STATE IN

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:08.612
THE LAST SEVENTEEN MONTHS.

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:09.112
THOSE PEOPLE ARE DRIVERS

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:09.680
DELIVERING CANNABIS PRODUCTS

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:11.982
SOME. AN APPROPRIATE TREATMENT

00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:13.517
FOR THOSE IN AND TO BE CVD WERE

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:14.351
HAS NO IMPACT ON THEIR DRIVING

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:16.586
ABILITY BECAUSE OF THE LACK

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:19.122
RESEARCH AND BECAUSE OF CURRENT

00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:21.591
LAW WE HAVE TO SEVEN ZERO EIGHT

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:22.859
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY ON.

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:27.297
CANNABIS USE I CAN'T. TWENTY SO

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:27.931
IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO SOLVE

00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:36.606
I THINK ANYBODY IS TO BLAME FOR

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:37.174
ITS REALITY THERE'S BEEN SO

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:37.808
LITTLE RESEARCH PARTLY BECAUSE

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:38.442
OF FEDERAL LAW MAKE. SO HARD TO

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:39.009
FUND RESEARCH BUT THE STATE

00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:39.576
COULD REALLY BE A LEADER IN

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:40.177
ADAM. ANY PRE ATION. HIS YOU

THAT ARE UP I'D OF THE LEGAL

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:21.752
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE TODAY

THESE PROBLEMS AND THIS IS IN

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:31.995
IN ON THE SITUATION- BUT WELL I

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:37.000
HOPE. SO I. AM NOT A STRATEGY

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:41.605
ROOM BUT I. PEOPLE DEEPLY CAN.

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:42.506
IS LATER I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:43.473
COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESS OF

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:43.974
THIS EXPERIMENT. AND THE

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:47.010
INDUSTRY IS I THINK THE PEOPLE.

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:47.778
WANT TO SEE THE SIXTY. SO I'M

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:50.847
UP TO. WE PROBLEMS BUT HE THERE

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:52.916
ARE PROBLEMS AND- AND WE NEED

00:50:52.983 --> 00:50:54.284
TO WALL WORK TOGETHER TO FIX

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:55.485
THEM IF IS. EXCEED BECAUSE

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.654
THERE'S STILL A POSSIBILITY.

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:58.255
GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW THE RATIO

00:50:58.321 --> 00:50:59.556
OF ILLEGAL ILLEGAL MARKET.

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:00.157
THERE'S STILL THE POSSIBILITY

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:01.625
THAT THIS EXPERIMENT FAILED.

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.527
AND WE GO BACK TO. YOU KNOW

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:05.562
ENTIRELY ILLEGAL MARKET NOW THE

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:07.464
DISASTER. SO MANY REASONS. SO

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:11.134
WHETHER ON. ON LOCAL ACCESS IS

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:12.769
CRITICAL- AS LONG AS THERE'S

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:13.870
ONLY FOUR HUNDRED SO

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:15.939
DISPENSARIES IN THE STATE OF.

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:18.108
THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE.

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:20.777
PEOPLE GONNA GO DEAL. BECAUSE

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:21.378
THE DOING FOREVER AND THE BAY

00:51:21.445 --> 00:51:22.612
PRICES WERE SAYING IS ALL ABOUT

00:51:22.679 --> 00:51:23.513
THAT. INJURY THAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.382
THERE'S AN ILLEGAL MARKET. IN A

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:26.716
WAY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IN

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:30.487
A REGULATED MARKET ALL OF OUR-

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:31.121
TEST TO A FARE THEE WELL. WHICH

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:33.757
IS GREAT WE WANT. MORE SAFE. SO

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:34.357
I THINK THAT THINGS LIKE LOCAL

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:36.460
ACCESS. DOING SOMETHING TO. IT

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:38.161
DEVICE WITH A CARROT AND STICK

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:40.797
MAYBE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO.

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:47.871
DOING THEIR. JOB AND YOU KNOW

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:48.472
WHEN YOU SLICE TO ALLOW THESE

00:51:48.538 --> 00:51:52.776
LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WEEK.

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.778
EITHER ACTION OF. BEING ALONE

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:55.712
LIMITED PROHIBITION. THIS

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:56.780
EXAMPLE OF THE STATE. KAMALA

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:58.014
CARROTS ARIVED THERE IS TAX

00:51:58.081 --> 00:51:59.683
MONEY AVAILABLE. TO ENCOURAGE

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:01.551
LOCAL RACES I WOULD SAY THAT'S

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:02.486
NUMBER ONE. IS GETTING MORE

00:52:02.552 --> 00:52:04.020
LEGAL BUSINESS. AND ACROSS THE

00:52:04.087 --> 00:52:05.422
STATE IN THIS IS THAT'S

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:07.624
INTRODUCED A YEAR IN THE

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:08.425
DELIVERY BUSINESSES WELL OF.

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:11.261
THE IN THIS COSTA MY- IGNORANCE

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:13.864
OF THE- TOPIC BUT IF I RECALL.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.967
THERE'S A BIG QUESTION NOW

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.268
WHETHER YOU CAN DELIVER IN.

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:21.605
HAVE AID THAT DECISION TO HAVE

CARED AT HOLISTICALLY OF COURSE

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:25.769
THERE IS THE TENSION BETWEEN

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:30.307
FEDERAL PROHIBITION AND WHAT IS

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:30.874
HAPPENING IN STATES I THINK

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:32.842
WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF. ONLY

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:35.178
MORE SO THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN OR

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:38.014

00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:54.331
ACKNOWLEDGING STATES THAT HAVE

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:54.898
LEGAL MARIJUANA Là AS AN

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:55.532
CONSIDERING AT THE SCHEDULING

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:56.099
IN THOSE STATES THROUGH THE

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:56.733
STATE ACT OR HAVE SOCIAL EQUITY

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.470
SHOULD BE A LEVEL. I'M AT AS WE

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:01.538
CONTINUE TO SEE A SEA CHANGE

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:03.373
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.408
MORE STATES COMING ON LINE IT

00:54:05.475 --> 00:54:08.411
ALSO HELPS. BEING OF FOLKS AT

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:10.780
THE FEDERAL LEVEL UNTIL. YOU

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:12.682
KNOW THE CONTEMPORARY TIMES OF

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:14.718
WE'RE SEEING IN CALIFORNIA BUT

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:16.219
I THINK SHE APPROPRIATELY

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.420
CAPTURED AT THING THERE

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:19.589
DEFINITELY IS A TENSION BETWEEN

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:22.258
THE ILLICIT MARKET AND A LEGAL

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:24.961
ONE AND I THINK. IT'S A REAL

00:54:25.028 --> 00:54:27.897
CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY. THE HARMS

00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:29.165
THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS HAD

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:30.500
ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:32.702
BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:36.906
FOLKS WHO WANT TO MOVE INTO THE

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:44.047
REGULATED INDUSTRY DO NOT HAVE

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:44.681
BARRIERS TO DO SELL. DIFFERENT

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:45.348
KINDS PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:46.016
HAVE. REDUCED FEE. OR FEEL THE

00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:47.917
FIRST FOR PAUL TO COME INTO THE

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:50.687
LEGAL REGULATED MARKET

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:53.123
IMPORTANT. ALL AND THAT IS ALSO

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:54.924
WHY MADMEN PUTS. MAD MEN NEXT.

00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:56.292
PROVIDING DIFFERENT KINDS OF

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:57.060
CORRECT I'M IN TRAINING ABOUT

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:59.763
HOW TO BE SICK THIS MARKET

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.464
ESPECIALLY AS SOCIAL EQUITY

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:03.466
PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE THE

00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:06.703
ONLY WAY THAT. WELL AS IF THEY

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:07.237
ARE NOT COMPETING AGAINST

00:55:07.303 --> 00:55:10.507
ELLISON. OTHER THING I WOULD

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:13.643
ADD TO THAT IS IT FOR CONSUMERS

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:17.447
TO DIFFERENTIATE BUT ILLICIT

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:18.048
OPERATORS AND LEGAL REGULATED

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:20.850
OPERATORS. THE CITY OF LOS

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:23.586
ANGELES THEY LOOK VERY SIMILAR-

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.989
AND SELL. DECISION AROUND AN

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:28.391
EMBLEM PROGRAM OR JUST MORE

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:30.126
EDUCATION TO CONSUMERS ABOUT

00:55:30.193 --> 00:55:33.063
HOW TO CHECK FOR WHAT IS

00:55:33.129 --> 00:55:34.964
POPULATED VERSUS NOT I THINK

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:36.166
IT'S STILL NEEDED. HELP MAY MAY

00:55:36.232 --> 00:55:37.233
I DID TELL YOU KNOW A GOOD DEAL

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.736
OF THE LEGAL COULD PRODUCTION

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:40.870
OUR STATE ACTUALLY GOES OUT OF

00:55:40.937 --> 00:55:42.105
STATE TO AND SO THERE'S

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.873
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE OVER

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.942
OREGON PASSED A LAW THAT ALLOWS

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:48.178
INTERSTATE SHIPPING BETWEEN TWO

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:49.312
TO SEE. THE LIGHTS CAM IF

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:51.181
THEY'RE CONTIGUOUS THERE'S A

00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:54.217
MOVIE UNDER WAY TO LOOK AT A

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:54.718
FEDERAL KIND OF EITHER A

00:55:54.784 --> 00:55:56.953
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT. BUT ALSO

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:57.520
GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:58.321
ALLOW SHIPPING ACROSS STATE

00:55:58.388 --> 00:55:59.255
LINES THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY

00:55:59.322 --> 00:56:01.458
ALSO. BECAUSE YOU CAN SHIP IT

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:03.126
OUT OF STATE LEGALLY THEN WILL

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.360
BE MORE INCENTIVE FOR THESE

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:06.730
ILLEGAL ROLLERS TO GET IT. CAN

00:56:06.796 --> 00:56:07.397
TODAY SHIP FROM CANNOT YOU CAN

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:07.997
ACHIEVE APPROXIMATELY I DON'T

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:09.332
THINK THAT WOULD BE YEP FEDERAL

00:56:09.399 --> 00:56:11.101
BUT BUT THEORETICALLY IF I IF

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:12.969
YOU RADICALLY IF THE CALIFORNIA

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:13.536
STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:14.137
GOVERNOR SIGNED A BILL. THAT

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:16.940
THAT WE WILL. BE ACROSS THE

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:20.310
STATE LINE CONTINUOUS SAY TO

00:56:20.376 --> 00:56:22.378
ALLOW WASHINGTON OREGON. NEVADA

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:23.546
ALL TO SHIP AMONG THEMSELVES

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:24.247
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE A

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:25.615
PROBLEM WITH IT BUT- IN THE

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.684

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:36.092
BE GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY

OKAY TO BE MORE COMPETITION IS

00:58:56.866 --> 00:59:00.203
GOOD FOR CONSUMERS IF THE PRICE

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:00.737
OF THE PRODUCT COMES DOWN

00:59:00.803 --> 00:59:01.371

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:28.097
THERE'S THIS IMBALANCE IN AGAIN

00:59:28.164 --> 00:59:28.564
IS THE BECAUSE OF THE

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:29.165
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LEAGUE.

00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:30.967
LEGAL MARKET. I'M COULD. COME

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:34.170
THEY SHOULD NOT BE THE. GROW

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:35.605
CANNABIS. CASES IN MAINE WHERE

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:37.006
THEY HAVE TO DO IT IN THE- AND

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:39.909
IT'S INCREDIBLY EXPEND. ENERGY

00:59:39.976 --> 00:59:42.912
EFFICIENT HOME WHEN WE- SIGNED

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:43.413
GROWING UP FOR THE WHOLE

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:48.151
COUNTRY SO. IT'S A QUICK TO

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:49.652
PROMISE THAT LACK OF A FEDERAL

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.688
SYSTEM TO ALLOW IT IS WITH. TO

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:54.424
GATHER BUT ILLEGAL BUT THERE'S

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:54.991
NOT AN OVERSUPPLY IN STATES

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:57.927
LIKE OREGON THERE'S A THEMATIC.

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:59.829
THEY PASSED A LOT OF TO GO OUT

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:00.463
ACROSS THE STATE HOPEFULLY OVER

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.532
SOMETHING INTERESTING WHAT. I

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:03.099
DON'T KNOW BUT SHE IS THERE

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:03.700
HE'LL BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:07.537
SEE. MOVEMENT AT THE FEDERAL

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:11.174
LEVEL ANYTIME SOON. THERE'S A

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.142
POTENTIAL CHANGE IN YOU KNOW

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:14.644
LEADERSHIP IN TWENTY TWENTY I

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:16.312
JUST DON'T KNOW THAT AT THE

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:17.380
FEDERAL LEVEL FOR YOU GIVEN THE

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.750
COMPOSITION OF CONGRESS AT ALL-

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.685
AND SO WILL THE BE ADJUSTMENTS

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:26.022
MADE IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.689
WHAT COULD THEY LOOK LIKE YEAH

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:28.257
YEAH SO AGAIN THERE HAVE HAVING

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:28.992
INTERSTATE REMAIN. SHIPPING

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:30.693
WOULD BE WOULD BE HUGE I DO I

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.428
DO I'M A LITTLE MORE OPTIMISTIC

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:33.730
ABOUT THE THINGS HAPPENING

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:34.597
WATCHING I THINK THE

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:35.565
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS HAS BOGGED

01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:38.701
DOWN AND WILL FOR AWHILE BUT

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:42.138
THE STICK. THE HOUSE OF

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:42.705
REPRESENTATIVES THIS SUMMER

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:50.713
PASSED. WITH NIGHT. WELL

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.214
DEMOCRAT ALMOST ALL THE

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:51.748
DEMOCRATS. THE BANKING ACT

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.317
WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:01:17.874
CONNELL. OF IT AS IMPLICIT

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.943
OTHERWISE. ON THE POPULATIONS

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:21.544
THAT TO ME EIGHT IN THE SPACE

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:24.947
AS WELL. THE PROGRAMS ARE

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:27.517
IMPORTANT DEEPER MORE SYSTEMIC

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:30.753
IT COMES WITH THE AROUND HOW

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.022
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR POOR THEIR

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:35.691
PERCEIVED THOSE WHO BEEN FORMER.

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:36.826
TOUCHED BY THE BILL JUST ASSIST

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:37.960
SO IT'S IMPORTANT WE PUSH THE

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:39.529
EQUITY BUT WE CAN'T YOU KNOW A

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:42.031
SO THAT WILL BE ENOUGH THE WE

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:44.000
HAVE TO GO MUCH DEEPER IN TERMS

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:46.769

AND ANOTHER ONE IN JANUARY.

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:04.754
HALF OF THE COHORT THAT WAS

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:08.291
THERE. BROTHER HAD AIDS

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:09.559

KNOWS THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.269
DEFINITELY PARTNER- SINCE WE

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:21.804

YOUR COVER CITY HEADQUARTERS

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:24.207
YEAH WHICH I HAVE TO COME SEE I

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:27.110
HAVE A LITTLE. TO MAKE THAT

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:28.678
HAPPEN NOW I RECORD WITH. OR

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:32.348
INTERNET SO. FROM YOUR

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:33.783
PERSPECTIVE WHOEVER WANTS TO

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.918
ANSWER YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:37.954
BIGGEST OBSTACLE THAT MAY BE A

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.756
RATHER SOFT TISSUE BUT AS AS

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:41.757
WHEN I TRY TO WRAP YOUR HEAD

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:43.793
AROUND THIS YOU KNOW IS THE

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.963
LACK OF BANKING IS AT THE

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:49.632
BURKE. REGULATION OR IS IT. 60%

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:50.199
OF LOCAL GOT THAT BASICALLY

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:54.937
AREN'T. STEPPED UP TO THE.

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.873
PLATE TO PLAY- WHAT'S THE

01:02:56.939 --> 01:03:02.011
BIGGEST. I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:03.679
SENATOR IT'S AS THE THIRD IT'S

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:07.917
IF OF ACCESS TO LEGAL PRODUCT

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:11.954
AND IS THAT IS THAT THEIR WAY

01:03:12.021 --> 01:03:15.391
OF AS WE GO. BACK CULTURE IS

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:21.097
THEIR WAY OF. NOT SUPPORTING

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:22.565
THE BALLOT INITIATIVE AND JUST

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:23.099
NOT WANTING TO BE IN THE

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.167
BUSINESS IS IT CONSTITUENT

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:27.570
PRESSURE. LET A THIRD ELEMENT

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:29.005
INTO THEIR COMMUNITY WHAT WHAT

01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:30.573
WHAT ARE WE HEARING FROM LOCAL

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.241
GOVERNMENT IT'S FUNNY THE SICK

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.043
AFTER FOR EXAMPLE. THE CITY

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.245
MAP- PROP SIXTY FOUR PASSED THE

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:40.349
61% IN. 1045% MORE THAN THE

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:40.816
STATE AVERAGE ON THAT

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:47.256
TELEVISION. CANCEL THAT IS

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.458
SEVEN IS PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:50.092
THINK IT'S- VERSION AMONG LOCAL

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.962
OF. LOOK IN A MIRROR EVERY

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.496
MORNING TEA AKON OUR STATE

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.698
SENATOR. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:58.534
IT MESSES UP THEY ONLY. TO GET

01:03:58.601 --> 01:04:04.640
ENOUGH. RIGHT IF THEY DO AND SO

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:05.208
THE RISK ADVERSE THEY DON'T

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:06.876
WANT TO DO ANYTHING. BASS

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:08.177
PLAYER BECAUSE- THANKS AND

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:08.744
THEY'RE AFRAID BECAUSE THEY

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:10.213
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THEY

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:11.214
HAVEN'T SEEN IT OPERATE IT'S A

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.182
NEW THING AND SO I THINK MORE

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:14.517
THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU'LL FIND

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:15.718
A LOT OF KIMI OPPOSITION WE

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:17.220
WENT THERE HEARING. OFTEN IS

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:18.287
LIKE A PARENTS GROUP IS

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.422
CONCERNED ABOUT YOUTH AND

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:21.424
THAT'S REALLY. WAS MAKE SURE

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.859
THE KIDS DON'T MESS AROUND HERE

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:26.128
WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE USING IT

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:26.729
IS BECAUSE IT'S WHETHER RANGER

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:29.465
DEVELOPING. WHICH. REPRESENT OF

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:30.399
THE POLICE ASSOCIATION IS YOURS

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:31.767
IS AS HE ATE. AND I CAN

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.402
EDUCATION GROUP. EVERYBODY ELSE

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:34.003
AND WAS SUPPORTED AND THAT AND

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:34.904
THE- COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO BUT

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:37.673
YOU'RE STILL RESISTED. I THINK

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.307
THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING. IS IT

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:38.874
AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY REAL

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:41.410
INCENTIVE. RIGHT THERE THE

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:42.578
PROBLEMS FROM THE ILLEGAL

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:43.813
MARKET DON'T AFFECT THEM- AND

01:04:43.879 --> 01:04:44.447
DEATH. AND SO I THINK THAT THEY

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:47.116
NEED TO BE A SET OF. POSITIVE

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:49.552
AND NEGATIVE REWARDS FOR NOT

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:52.622
JOB IN ALLOWING THE VOTERS TO

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:53.256
HAVE WITH THEIR- OTHERWISE WHEN

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:54.557
IS THE BALLOT ISSUE AFTER

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:55.124
BALLOT INITIATIVE WHICH IS A

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:59.295
TERRIBLE WAY TO LEGISLATE. YES.

01:04:59.362 --> 01:04:59.829
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IN

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:03.633
TERMS OF THE. BIG ROLE YEAH I

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:06.435
WOULD BE THAT IT'S DEFINITELY

01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:08.204
ABOUT A LACK OF ACCESS TO IN

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:11.407
DIFFERENT CITIES I THINK.

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:11.907
ANOTHER REASON WHY IS A

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:14.010
CHALLENGE FOR CITIES TO.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.778
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:18.414
DIFFERENT MODELS OUT CALIFORNIA

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:21.250
AND SO FOR THEM TO TAKE IT ON

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:22.385
SEEING THAT SOME CITIES ARE

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:24.587
MIRED IN LAWSUITS THROUGH THE-

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:27.123
LOT COMPETITIVE LICENSING SSE

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:30.459
IS THAT THEY HAVE O CREATE. AT

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:32.128
TIMES AN ENTIRELY NEW

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:35.431
DEPARTMENT AT THE CITY AND

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:36.032
NEEDS TO BE. THEY'RE GOING TO

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:39.435
DO IT FOR. IT'S NOT THE EASIEST

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.537
THING TO EMPLOYMENT AS MIGHT BE

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:44.307
VALLEY'S INTO RIGHT NOW SO I

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.375
STUDENTS ABOUT THE- PROCESS IN

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:52.014
THE AND HOW. LICENSES HAVE BEEN

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:52.648
SELECTED YES AND I. A HAS DONE

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:53.182
AN AMAZING JOB OF PUTTING

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:55.284
TOGETHER MODEL LEGISLATION THE

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:57.553
ORDINANCES ABOUT WHAT. A CITY

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.623
CAN DEAL AND THE MORE EXAM. A

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.025
PLUGIN PLAY GOLD STANDARD OF

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:04.226
THIS IS HOW YOU SET IT UP ON

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:08.130
THE BACK. CITIES PERHAPS THAT

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:09.932
CAN. HELP EXPEDITE IT I ALSO

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:12.001
REALLY THINK WE CAN IGNORE. THE

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:14.337
LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL IT IS

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:17.373
REALLY HARD TO BUSINESS UP AND

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.841
RUNNING AND TO ENSURE THAT

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.710
BUSINESSES ARE SUCCESSFUL

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:22.812
ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST YEAR OF

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:23.346
OPERATE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:27.383
STATE. BUT ALL IN THERE ARE A

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:31.587
LOT OF FEAR. ACROSS THE BOARD

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.989
SURE IF THAT ONE LAST QUESTION

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:36.359
MAY THIRTY OF COURSE THE-

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:42.031
PERCENT OF LOCAL. WHO ARE THE

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:44.333
IS IF YOU CAN THESE ARE THESE

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.705
ARE THE I. I THINK BY AND IT

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:52.241
COUNTIES ARE ARE WE FOCUSED ON

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:57.046
CULTIVATION. TEND TO AUTHORIZE

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:58.814
AS MANY DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:03.552
CAMPUS ACTIVITIES I THINK

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:04.987
NUMBERS CLEARLY CITIES OF THE

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:05.521
WORST OFFENDERS WE OF FOUR

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.456
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO CITIES.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:08.891
ALL OF OUR OUR OUR RETAIL.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:12.395
WITHIN THE AS AN WITH ONE AND

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:16.265
FOUR. THE CITY'S ACTUALLY THE

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:18.267
RACING RETALIATING PARTICULAR

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:20.069
PROBLEM AND I DO. IT'S MADE BY

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:24.707
BOTH. BECAUSE I'M IN TERMS OF.

SAID BY THE SCIENTIFIC PANEL WE-

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.661
THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR US GOING

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.196

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:46.508
BETTER THAN THAT I COULD I

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:47.109
DON'T KNOW IF NICOLE CAN DO

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.143

01:10:58.053 --> 01:10:58.654
PRESENT TENSE WE HAVE A-

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.656
PERFECT. RIGHT THE URINE

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:02.925
TESTING IS NOT IDEAL- UNLIKE

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.360
ALCOHOL WITH THE FERTILIZER

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:05.828
TEST WE CAN BE PRETTY DECISIVE

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:08.530
SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.733
TO YOU KNOW. THAT'S THAT- WE

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:12.668
DON'T HAVE THAT HERE AND UNTIL

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:15.404
WE HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM. THE

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:18.574
FLAG MEETINGS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:19.174
SOME WAY TO DO SOME TESTING AS

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:21.777
A SAFETY CONCERN. SO TO GO

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:24.480
THROUGH I WON'T GET INTO THAT

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:26.048
OF ANY RESEARCH I DISCUSSED

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.751
EARLIER WELL THAT. SOME OF THE

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.152
SIDE EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA CAN

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:33.355
TAKE- INCLUDE- IMPAIRMENT OF

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:35.624
JUDGE A REACTION TIME ISSUES

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.293
LIKE THAT RIGHT AGAIN. RESEARCH

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:38.894
ON GOING CAMPUS THAT. WE HOPE

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:42.731
FOR MORE. BUT PUTTING THAT IN

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:45.367
CONTEXT RIGHT WITH THE FEDERAL

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:46.135
PATIENTS IN SOMETHING IT WAS

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:46.902
TOUCHED ON BRIEFLY I WANT TO

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.571
EMPHASIZE ON THE SIDE RIGHT.

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:50.606
THERE IS A THE FEDERAL

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:51.507
ENFORCEMENT ISSUE WHICH HOPE

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:54.009
BANKING LAW ME. IN THE CRIMINAL

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:56.612
LAW HAS BEEN GENTLY FORCED- BUT

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:57.846
BIGGEST CONCERN ON THE BUSINESS

01:11:57.913 --> 01:11:59.214
SIDE PROUDLY. FEDERAL

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.849
CONTRACTING RIGHT AND GRANT

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.985
RULES- AROUND A DRUG FREE

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:05.354
WORKPLACE ISN'T AN ACT OF

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:05.921
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT RIGHT.

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.222
I'M BECAUSE THE ISSUE FOR ANY

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:08.957
EMPLOYER IN. THE WORKS WITH THE

OF WHAT WE DO ON OTHER FRONTS

ISSUE FOR A LOT OF BIG THIS IN

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:22.805
CALIFORNIA. SO TRYING TO THAT

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:23.405
CAN RESULT IN POSITION RIGHT

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:24.540
THE RESULTING TO DIFFICULT

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.241

THAT'S THE WAY IT LOOKS PRETTY

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:43.625
THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW. WE

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:45.561
HAVE. BROUGHT COMMUNITY BIG

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:46.762

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.799
SOME THE OTHER WISE POINTS THAT

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:33.168
WERE RAISED I'M DEALING WITH

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:33.602
TESTING IN THE ISSUE

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:37.272
PERFORMANCE TO REYES. IT AHEAD

01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:37.873
OF QUESTIONS BUT THAT SERVICE

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:42.644
ONE HOURS. SEVEN I. ENGLISH AND

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:45.714
TESTING SOME PERFORMANCE IS

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:47.115
ALSO AN IMPERFECT ISSUE HAVE

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:48.450
FOR POLICE ACTING RIGHT ISSUES

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:49.017
LIKE THAT I TWITCH WHEN YOU

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:53.555
LOOK A CERTAIN WAY. THE 5265%

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:54.857
ACCURATE. IN NOT A PERFECT

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:55.924
BAROMETER SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:59.127
THE SETTING. LOOK AT. THERE'S

01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:00.462
JUST NOT THE PERFECT TEST OUT

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:02.064
THERE. YOU KNOW I LOOK FORWARD

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:05.767
TO IT GLAZER TEST I THINK IT'S

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:06.301
A COMPANY CALLED HOUND LAP

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:08.303
RECALL CORRECTLY. THAT WOULD BE

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:11.473
ON TWENTY TWENTY. SO I HOPE

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.574
THAT THOSE DEVELOP BETTER THAT

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:16.078
WOULD REALLY RESOLVE A LOT OF

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:18.947
CONCERN THIS ISSUE AND MAKE IT

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:19.548
EASIER EMPLOYERS WHO WOULDN'T

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:20.249
THAT IF THAT THAT. WHEN WITH

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:23.085
THE U. OF T. C. OR WOULD YOUR

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:26.655
LEVEL OF. HE IS AN ANAGRAM

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:30.659
HOWEVER IT'S RED. I MEAN IF YOU

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:34.730
DID A URINE TEST AND YOU HAVE.

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:36.932
THE A METABOLITE. THINK

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:37.532
METABOLIZED IN THERE THAT HOW

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:40.135
WOULD THAT AFFECT THAT.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:42.971
OPPORTUNITY OR RIGHT. I'M NOT A

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.840
PERFECT I WILL BE A SCIENTIST

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:45.874
AND BREATH YEP BUT VIRTUE THE

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:46.775
BREATHALYZER TEST.

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:48.710
THEORETICALLY TESS RECENTLY

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:50.012
ENOUGH TO DETERMINE EXACTLY

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:51.546
WHEN IT WAS CONSUMES THE TERM

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:52.581
IF YOU'RE WITHIN THE LIKE END

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.449
OF IMPAIRMENT WHICH IS THE

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:55.784
PROBLEM TESTING YOU CAN'T

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:57.185
DETERMINE IT AND THAT WINDOW.

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:59.288
I'M SO THAT THAT'S THE IDEAL

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:00.389
DIFFERENTIATION MAKE IT

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:02.524
POTENTIAL TO NAIL DOWN IT IS

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:06.528
THIS TEST INDICATED. PRESENT

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:07.129
APPARENTLY. THERE WOULD NOT BE

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:17.072
ANY. DENIAL FOR THE. OPTION FOR

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:19.341
THE ANSWERS SORRY I'M SO NO

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.611
NOTE THAT OPTION WOULD BE

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:23.111
ATTAINABLE AND FLOSSING

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:24.813
HYPOTHETICAL. WHICH IS THE

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.814
SITUATION THE PROBLEM AND THAT

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:27.115
WOULD EMPLOYER WOULD MAKE THAT

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:28.250
DECISION WHETHER USE OF HONOR

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.718
THC AT SOME POINT IN THE LAST

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:32.187
THIRTY DAYS- THE PROBLEM OR NOT

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:34.289
A PROBLEM WHAT BUT THAT

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:35.524
DECISION EMPLOYERS FACED WITH

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:36.458
NOW IN THE AND I CAN'T

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:38.260
DETERMINE WHEN RIGHT- THAT TEST

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:39.695
WE HAVE BETTER DATA. AND I

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:41.396
CAN'T BE TOO YOU KNOW WHAT

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:42.564
SPECIFIC PLAYERS MIGHT CHOOSE

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:45.267
TO DO WITH THAT BETTER SCIENCE

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:45.934
BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WOULD

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:48.136
RESULT IN A CONCERT IT WOULD IS

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:51.106
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY THEN HOW

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:52.641
WOULD THAT AFFECT THAT WE HAVE

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:56.778
ALLIES FOR THE- WITH AREN'T.

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:57.412

SOMEWHERE IN WHATEVER IT IS AS

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:06.655
TO HOW EMPLOYERS EGYPT JEWEL'S

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:10.192
POP AND PLAYERS SEE THEY MIGHT.

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:11.893
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE CHOICES

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.662
THAT YOU. THINK THAT WE HAVE

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:14.162
RIGHT NOW ANYWHERE. YEAH

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.696
IMPROVEMENT IN THE BENEFIT

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:16.999
THERE IS THE- BODY WITH ACCESS

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:18.000
TO BETTER DATA RIGHT TO ADDRESS

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:19.735
THIS QUESTION OF IMPAIRMENT

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.770
MORE PRECISE WAY AND TO. I CAN

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:23.605
GET TO A SECOND. WORKERS

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:24.539
COMPENSATION ONE OF THE ISSUES

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:26.475
THERE IS AN EXAMPLE I AGREE.

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:27.242
WITH THE ISSUES THAT COME.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:28.477
WORKERS COMPENSATION- AND

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:29.878
THERE'S- YOUR WE HAVEN'T DEALT

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:30.779
WITH ONE OF ONE OF THEM IS.

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:35.450
INTOXICATE SENSES RIGHT AFTER

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:35.984
POST ACCIDENT TESTING AND

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:40.022
THINGS LIKE THAT. AND BECAUSE

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:41.857
TO HAVE A DEFENSE TO WORKERS

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:42.424
COMPENSATION BASED ON TALKS

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.658
ISSHIN RIGHT IF YOU HAVE TO

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:45.560
DEMONSTRATE IMPAIRMENT AND ONE

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:48.397
OF THE PROBLEMS ON OUR SIDE

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:50.465
RIGHT AS EMPLOYERS IS THAT YOU

01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:51.600
AND- NAIL DOWN IMPAIR. THE

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:52.167
PRESENT TESTED SO LET'S SAY

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.169
THAT YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYER. THIS

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:54.803
DUMP I HAVE TO TURN IF THAT WAS

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:59.641
A FACTOR. MORE TROUBLING

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:00.208
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:03.979
TIME. THAT'S GENERAL POINT

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:05.147
THERE- WE SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:08.517
OUT THERE WHEN IT. AN I. S.

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.118
DISTINCTION IT WASN'T DISCUSSED

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:11.686
IS FULLY LIKE THERE WERE

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.789
REFERENCES TO ALCOHOL ONE

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:14.322
BETTER TESTING. AT A SAID

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:18.460
EARLIER. BUT THE BREATHALYZER

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:19.428
YOU CAN TIGHTEN PARENT. RIGHT

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:23.298
HOPEFULLY WE GET. IS THERE

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:24.866
ANYTHING ELSE I WANT TO WORK SO

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:29.471
MANY GOOD POINTS MADE EARLIER-

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:30.072
FORGIVE ME I. MAY HAVE MISSED

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:31.306
SOME IS GOING THROUGH. NO WAY

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.442
OUT COULD CLEARLY GIVE- NICOLE

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:34.376
THE BRIEF POINT IS THE

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.212
EMPLOYERS. WE HAVE THOSE TWO

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:39.114
CIVIL CALLS RIGHT ENSURING

01:18:39.181 --> 01:18:39.614

FEDERAL LEVEL AND AMBIGUOUS.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.255
TESTING AN INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:49.357
IT'S NOT A- SITUATION I WE WISH

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:50.358
IT WERE BETTER AND WE'RE

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:52.094
HOPEFUL IT WILL IMPROVE BUT- IT

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.695
STANDS WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO.

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:55.297

BOTHERS POLICIES TO SOME OR

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:13.215
RECOMMEND. ROACH THAN WHAT WE

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:14.149
CURRENTLY ARE USING OR THEY'RE

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:17.352

SLIGHTLY DISAGREEING. WITH A

01:57:38.885 --> 01:57:40.486
COMMENT MADE EARLIER-

01:57:40.553 --> 01:57:44.657
INCENTIVES TO CITIES TO HAVE A

01:57:44.724 --> 01:57:46.893
TO ADOPT ORDINANCES TO SALAS

01:57:46.959 --> 01:57:50.596
RETAIL COULD COULD BE USED AS A

01:57:50.663 --> 01:57:53.633
AS A LEVERAGE TO GET THEM. THE

AS A LEVERAGE TO GET THEM TO-

01:57:55.134 --> 01:57:56.402
TO ADOPT LOCAL ORDINANCES I

01:57:56.469 --> 01:57:58.371
WOULD ALSO SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH

01:57:58.438 --> 01:57:59.272
THEY MAY NOT HAVE A LOCAL

01:57:59.338 --> 01:58:01.407
ORDINANCE. IN THOSE CITIES THAT

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:02.275
DON'T HAVE A LOCAL ORDINANCE

01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:03.743

01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:05.578
OPERATOR. AND SO WE DO NEED

01:58:05.645 --> 01:58:06.546
ENFORCEMENT HAPPENING IN THOSE

01:58:06.612 --> 01:58:09.315
LOCATIONS AS WELL- BECAUSE THEY

01:58:09.382 --> 01:58:10.616
ARE COMPETITION FOR THOSE WHO

01:58:10.683 --> 01:58:12.185
ARE LEGALLY OPERATE. THE LAST

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:13.753
POINT I WOULD MAKE SOMETHING

REGULATIONS- IN LARGE PART

01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:30.002

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:34.707
CANNABIS- WE ARE NOW BOYS- IN

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:37.143
YOUR HOUSE WITH LEGISLATION TO

RESTORE ON THAT AUTHORITY NOT

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:41.247
JUST TO CANNABIS BUT TO THE

01:58:41.314 --> 01:58:43.249
INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE- WE THINK

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:44.684
THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS

01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:47.420
HELPING TO- COUNTER SOME OF THE

01:58:47.487 --> 01:58:48.855
LOSS IN JOBS THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:50.256
BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WITH.

01:58:50.323 --> 01:58:51.324
WITH THE CAMERAS INDUSTRY WITH

01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:52.124
HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL

01:58:52.191 --> 01:58:55.027
ADOPT THE HIM CHANGES AND

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:59.232
ENTHUSIASTICALLY AND. VERY

01:58:59.298 --> 01:58:59.832

SWEAR OFF ALL LESTER MEDICINE

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:20.887
BECAUSE THE WESTERN MEDICINE I

01:59:20.953 --> 01:59:21.954
WAS GIVEN WAS ACTUALLY KILLING

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:25.491

AND TWO THOUSAND SIX I A FIVE.

01:59:28.327 --> 01:59:29.662
THE CONDITIONS THAT QUALIFY

ACCIDENT WERE I WANT OF USING A

01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:43.109
WALKER AND A CANE. AT THAT TIME

01:59:43.175 --> 01:59:44.343
THEY STARTED LEARN ME UP WITH

01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:46.512
PHARMACEUTICALS AT THE END OF

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:47.847
MY PHARMACEUTICAL USED IN TWO

01:59:47.914 --> 01:59:49.682
THOUSAND LEFT OUT ELEVEN I WAS

ON FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:52.318
MEDICATIONS A MONTH. I'VE GONE

01:59:52.385 --> 01:59:54.587
DOWN TO FORTY WHO- I HAD

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:56.822
DROPPED FORTY FIVE POUNDS DOWN

01:59:56.889 --> 01:59:59.158
TO A HUNDRED AND TEN POUNDS.

01:59:59.225 --> 01:59:59.759
THOSE USING CANES AND WALKERS

01:59:59.825 --> 02:00:02.461
TO GET AROUND. ANNOUNCED TO ME

02:00:02.528 --> 02:00:03.496
THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO

02:00:03.563 --> 02:00:04.297
FOR ME THEY WERE TELLING ME I

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:05.064
WAS INTRACTABLE THE

02:00:05.131 --> 02:00:06.365
PHARMACEUTICAL FOR A LONGER

02:00:06.432 --> 02:00:07.600
WORKING. A TURN TO CANNABIS AND

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:09.468
I'D USE FAN OF THIS BEFORE AND

02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:11.404
I HELPED OTHER MEDICAL PATIENTS

02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:12.104
USED CANNABIS. WE DIDN'T

02:00:12.171 --> 02:00:14.006
CONSIDER MYSELF A PATIENT. WAS

02:00:14.073 --> 02:00:15.841
AT THAT TIME I REALIZED HOW

02:00:15.908 --> 02:00:17.543
IMPORTANT CANNABIS WAS TO ME IN

02:00:17.610 --> 02:00:20.112
MY LIFE. I CAN SAY NOW. I'VE

02:00:20.179 --> 02:00:22.381
BEEN EIGHT YEARS PHARMACEUTICAL

02:00:22.448 --> 02:00:23.716
FREE I DON'T EVEN USES SO MUCH

02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:25.451
AS AN ASPIRIN EVERYTHING IS

02:00:25.518 --> 02:00:26.886
TREATED HOLISTICALLY WITH

02:00:26.953 --> 02:00:30.289
CANNABIS. AND I DO USE T. H. C.

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:33.092
A. WHICH IS NON PSYCHOACTIVE.

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:35.494
HAS NOT BEEN ACTIVATED SO IF

02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:36.062
YOU WERE TO TEST ME. I WOULD

02:00:36.128 --> 02:00:38.230
TEST X. LEE HIGH AS YOU CAN SEE

02:00:38.297 --> 02:00:39.999
RIGHT NOW I AM NOT MEDICATED AT

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:41.534
ALL. I HAVE ALL MY COGNITIVE

02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:43.402
ABILITIES YES IF YOU WERE TO

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:45.471
USE THIS TEST MY TOLERANCE

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:46.038
LEVELS WOULD BE THROUGH THE

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:48.674
ROOF. BECAUSE I TAKE TWO

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:54.013
THOUSAND MILLIGRAMS OF THC A.

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:54.580
DAY ALONG WITH TWO THOUSAND

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:57.350
MILLIGRAMS CBV. SO GOING

02:00:57.416 --> 02:00:58.384
FORWARD HOW THIS IS IMPACTED ME

02:00:58.451 --> 02:00:59.218
IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE I MADE SIX

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:02.989
FIGURES A YEAR. ONCE I GOT

02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:03.923
HEALED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I

02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:05.758
COULD NOT GO BACK TO MY JOB.

02:01:05.825 --> 02:01:07.627
THE JOB THAT I CREATED THE

02:01:07.693 --> 02:01:09.061
CONGLOMERATION OF PRINTING

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:10.730
COMPANIES WHICH ENTAILED

02:01:10.796 --> 02:01:11.697
THIRTEEN DIFFERENT COMPANIES

02:01:11.764 --> 02:01:12.932
WHICH I WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

02:01:12.999 --> 02:01:14.433
BOARD BUT MY DRECTORS WOULD

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:15.635
NOT LET ME COME BACK TO WORK

02:01:15.701 --> 02:01:17.136
BECAUSE I WAS USING MEDICAL

02:01:17.203 --> 02:01:17.770
CANNABIS BECAUSE WE HAD FEDERAL

02:01:17.837 --> 02:01:21.507
CONTRACTS. THIS IS THIS IS

02:01:21.574 --> 02:01:23.809
SIMPLY DESTROYED MY LIFE AND

02:01:23.876 --> 02:01:24.944
MADE IT VERY HARD FOR ME TO

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:27.480
SURVIVE IN LIFE BECAUSE I NOW

02:01:27.546 --> 02:01:28.814
CAN ONLY MAKE THIRTY FIVE

02:01:28.881 --> 02:01:29.448
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BECAUSE

02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:31.017
I'M FORCED TO GO WORK IN TH

02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:32.518
MEDICAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:34.320
BECAUSE MY INDUSTRY AFTER

02:01:34.387 --> 02:01:35.688
TWENTY YEARS WILL NO LONGER

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:38.624
HIRE ME AND CONSIDERED A RISK.

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:40.092
SO THIS IS VERY IMPERATIVE THAT

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.460
WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND

02:01:41.527 --> 02:01:42.862
THAT WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND

02:01:42.928 --> 02:01:44.530
WE FIGURE AN ADEQUATE WAY OF

02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:46.332
MEASURING TOLERANCES. THIS

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:49.502
WITHOUT THAT. WE'RE DOOMED TO

02:01:49.568 --> 02:01:51.303
FAIL HER. AND WE NEED TO MOVE

02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:52.872
FORWARD. AND IT IS IMPORTANT

02:01:52.938 --> 02:01:54.073
THAT WE GRANT ACCESS THROUGH

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.876
THE ENTIRE STATE. BECAUSE

02:01:56.942 --> 02:01:58.010
65270% OF THE STATE DOES NOT

02:01:58.077 --> 02:02:00.079
HAVE ACCESS. EVEN IN MY OWN

02:02:00.146 --> 02:02:01.847
COUNTY A PLASTER COUNTY WHERE

02:02:01.914 --> 02:02:03.282
WE SPENT EIGHTEEN MONTHS DOING

02:02:03.349 --> 02:02:06.686
SURVEYS WE HAD 73% APPROVAL

02:02:06.752 --> 02:02:08.854
RATE IN THAT COMMUNITY. TO MOVE

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:11.590
FORWARD WITH CANNABIS BUT OR

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:12.158
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DECIDED

02:02:12.224 --> 02:02:14.360
NOT TO MOVE FORWARD. SO WE NEED

02:02:14.427 --> 02:02:16.395
TO REMOVE THE STIGMA WE NEED TO

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:18.064
STEP FORWARD WE NEED TO GET

02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:19.231
SOME ADEQUATE TESTING FOR

02:02:19.298 --> 02:02:21.600
TOLERANCES. AND TO MOVE FORWARD

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:23.402
AND I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR TIME

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:24.770
IN THE MOVING FORWARD THIS IS

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:26.405
LONG OVERDUE. AND I AM VERY

02:02:26.472 --> 02:02:29.075
APPRECIATIVE THANK YOU THANK
