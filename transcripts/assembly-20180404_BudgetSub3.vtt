00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:57.422 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO ARE. WITHIN THE LEGAL

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:58.657 region:rollup2
DELTA.

00:30:57.422 --> 00:31:00.292 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE CITY OF WEST

00:30:58.657 --> 00:31:01.460 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO.

00:31:00.292 --> 00:31:02.961 region:rollup2
LIKEWISE LOCATED WITHIN THE

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.563 region:rollup2
LEGAL DELTA.

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:06.298 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALL THE WAY AT THE FAR

00:31:04.563 --> 00:31:08.400 region:rollup2
END OF THE DELTA AT SEGMENTS

00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:10.235 region:rollup2
DESIGNATED WITHIN.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.670 region:rollup2
CITIES IN EASTERN CONTRA COSTA

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:13.038 region:rollup2
COUNTY SO THESE ARE TRAIL

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:15.707 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS THAT.

00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:17.642 region:rollup2
EXISTS THROUGH URBAN AREAS.

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:20.612 region:rollup2
THEY WERE DEVELOPED BY LOCAL

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:22.214 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS WE'VE.

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:24.583 region:rollup2
BUT OUR SEAL ON THEM AND AND

00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:26.084 region:rollup2
ADOPTED THEM THE SEGMENTS OF THE

00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:27.486 region:rollup2
GREAT CALIFORNIA DELTA TRAIL.

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:29.254 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF CONNECTION THAT

00:31:27.486 --> 00:31:30.455 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO OCCUR BETWEEN THOSE TWO

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:31.790 region:rollup2
URBAN AREAS AT THE FAR ENDS OF

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:33.024 region:rollup2
THE DELTA.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.427 region:rollup2
AND THE PURPOSE OF THE REQUEST

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:38.196 region:rollup2
TODAY IS TO COMPLETE AMASTER

00:31:35.427 --> 00:31:40.632 region:rollup2
PLAN. FOR THAT MORE DIFFICULT.

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:42.100 region:rollup2
THAT HAD SEGMENT ACT CONNECTING

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:43.702 region:rollup2
WHAT'S LARGELY RURAL LANDS IN

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.370 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

00:31:43.702 --> 00:31:48.006 region:rollup2
THE URBAN AREAS AT THE PERIPHERY

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.974 region:rollup2
OF THE DELTA.

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.409 region:rollup2
THERE'S ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL

00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:53.078 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE

00:31:50.409 --> 00:31:55.814 region:rollup2
TO CLARIFY THE STATUTE THAT.

00:31:53.078 --> 00:31:56.748 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE SAYS.

00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:58.383 region:rollup2
WE CAN ONLY REQUEST FUNDING FOR

00:31:56.748 --> 00:32:00.252 region:rollup2
THIS MAN.

00:31:58.383 --> 00:32:02.554 region:rollup2
WE ARE WE CAN ONLY COMPLETE WHEN

00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:03.855 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ALL THE FUNDING AMASSED.

00:32:02.554 --> 00:32:06.224 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE CREATING

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:07.426 region:rollup2
THE TRAIL SEGMENTS OURSELVES WE

00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:09.194 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE WORKING WITH LOCAL

00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:11.029 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS.

00:32:09.194 --> 00:32:12.864 region:rollup2
IN THERE TRANSPORTATION AND AND

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:14.866 region:rollup2
TRAIL PLANNING EFFORTS.

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:15.801 region:rollup2
TO HELP GUIDE THE CREATION OF

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:17.269 region:rollup2
THIS IN THEN TO DESIGNATE THOSE

00:32:15.801 --> 00:32:18.336 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:20.839 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T INTEND OURSELVES TO

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:22.474 region:rollup2
BE OUT THERE WITH.

00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:24.376 region:rollup2
HEAVY EQUIPMENT. YOU KNOW

00:32:22.474 --> 00:32:25.243 region:rollup2
BLEEDING BLEEDING A TRAIL FOR

00:32:24.376 --> 00:32:27.345 region:rollup2
THIS THROUGH THE INTERIOR PART

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:27.913 region:rollup2
OF THE DELTA.

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:30.348 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

00:32:27.913 --> 00:32:33.718 region:rollup2
AT THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MASTER

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:33.718 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:36.588 region:rollup2
WILL BE.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.089 region:rollup2
MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE

00:32:36.588 --> 00:32:39.357 region:rollup2
COLLABORATING TO FILL IN THE

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:42.027 region:rollup2
PIECES OF THE.

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:43.795 region:rollup2
UP OF THE TRAILS WHO I AM

00:32:42.027 --> 00:32:45.430 region:rollup2
OVERTIME THAT'S PRETTY CAN BE

00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:48.033 region:rollup2
PRETTY HARD THAT TO PROTECT.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:50.435 region:rollup2
BASED ON FUNDING SOURCES ANOTHER

00:32:48.033 --> 00:32:52.771 region:rollup2
A. POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:54.906 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY.

00:32:52.771 --> 00:32:56.208 region:rollup2
BECOME A REALITY. YEAH I IT IT

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:57.742 region:rollup2
IT WE AT WE DON'T HAVE A

00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:59.377 region:rollup2
PREDICTION FOR WHEN THIS.

00:32:57.742 --> 00:33:01.746 region:rollup2
ULTIMATE LINKAGE WILL OCCUR.

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:03.381 region:rollup2
.

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:04.382 region:rollup2
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ULTIMATELY

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:06.885 region:rollup2
SOME OF IT MIGHT.

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:08.420 region:rollup2
NOT EVEN BEYOND ROAD SEGMENTS

00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:10.555 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE. MANY MANY

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.724 region:rollup2
MILES OF WATERWAYS THAT TRAVERSE

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:14.926 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE DELTA.

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:16.695 region:rollup2
A WATER TRAIL IS A POSSIBILITY

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:18.630 region:rollup2
FOR PORTIONS OF THIS.

00:33:16.695 --> 00:33:21.032 region:rollup2
BUT OF COURSE THE WHAT WE HOPE

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:23.502 region:rollup2
TO DO IS TO CONNECTED THROUGH.

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:24.703 region:rollup2
OF LAND SEGMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S

00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:25.904 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY HOW YOU KNOW PEOPLE

00:33:24.703 --> 00:33:27.572 region:rollup2
WOULD.

00:33:25.904 --> 00:33:29.174 region:rollup2
RECREATION TRAVEL THROUGHOUT

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:31.042 region:rollup2
THIS REGION.

00:33:29.174 --> 00:33:33.211 region:rollup2
ON A TRAIL WHETHER IT BE ON

00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:35.614 region:rollup2
BIKER FOOT TUMOR EVEN.

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:37.616 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY EQUESTRIAN USES WELL

00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:38.717 region:rollup2
WHAT SO MANY OF FIVE THESE PLANS

00:33:37.616 --> 00:33:39.251 region:rollup2
IN THE THE ONE THAT COMES TO

00:33:38.717 --> 00:33:41.820 region:rollup2
MIND FOR ME IS VIA COASTAL

00:33:39.251 --> 00:33:43.288 region:rollup2
TRAIL.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.155 region:rollup2
I'M A IT.

00:33:43.288 --> 00:33:46.258 region:rollup2
TAKE DECADES TO.

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:47.659 region:rollup2
AT A TO BUILD OUT IT WOULD BE

00:33:46.258 --> 00:33:49.027 region:rollup2
NICE TO.

00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:50.729 region:rollup2
SEE IF WE CAN'T FIND A WAY TO

00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:53.331 region:rollup2
ACCELERATE THE PROCESS OF THAT

00:33:50.729 --> 00:33:55.333 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T TAKE MANY DECADES.

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:57.202 region:rollup2
PERHAPS COULD TAKE OF A MUCH

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:58.837 region:rollup2
SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. SO

00:33:57.202 --> 00:34:00.372 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT HOW AS

00:33:58.837 --> 00:34:01.406 region:rollup2
AS WE GO FORWARD YOU MENTIONED

00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:03.875 region:rollup2
DUH.

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:05.944 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WORD URBANIZATION THEN.

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:08.380 region:rollup2
I ASSUME THAT'S A A CODE WORD

00:34:05.944 --> 00:34:10.215 region:rollup2
FOR. AYE ENCROACHING DEVELOPMENT

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.083 region:rollup2
ON ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE

00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:13.418 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:15.420 region:rollup2
THE PAST IS THAT.

00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:17.289 region:rollup2
FAIRLY ACCURATE THAT THAT WAS

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.757 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE THE OF WHAT WAS

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:20.425 region:rollup2
OCCURRING IN THE EARLY LATE

00:34:18.757 --> 00:34:22.060 region:rollup2
EIGHTIES INTO THE EARLY NINETEEN

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:23.428 region:rollup2
NINETIES THAT LED TO THE

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.063 region:rollup2
ADOPTION OF THE. DELTA

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:27.465 region:rollup2
PROTECTION ACT OF NINETEEN

00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:28.466 region:rollup2
NINETY TWO WHAT CERTAINLY TRUE

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:30.468 region:rollup2
SINCE THAT TIME IS THAT THE

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:32.304 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:34.039 region:rollup2
DELTA REGION AND THERE ARE FIVE

00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:36.341 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT.

00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:38.376 region:rollup2
BOB PRIMARILY HAVE THE LAND USE

00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:40.011 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION OVER WHAT WE CALLED

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:41.079 region:rollup2
PRIMARY ZONE OF THE DELTA.

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:43.114 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ALL EMBRACED

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:43.715 region:rollup2
THE.

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:46.518 region:rollup2
OUR IN OUR PLAN FOR THE DELTA

00:34:43.715 --> 00:34:47.919 region:rollup2
AT.

00:34:46.518 --> 00:34:49.354 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THAT

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:51.323 region:rollup2
EMBRACING THAT PLANET WHETHER

00:34:49.354 --> 00:34:52.591 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS

00:34:51.323 --> 00:34:54.359 region:rollup2
HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE.

00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:55.727 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO GET AROUND IN TERMS

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:57.128 region:rollup2
OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WE HAVE NOT

00:34:55.727 --> 00:34:58.997 region:rollup2
SEEN THAT FURTHER INCURSION OF

00:34:57.128 --> 00:35:01.232 region:rollup2
URBANIZATION.

00:34:58.997 --> 00:35:03.802 region:rollup2
INTO THE INTERIOR DELTA AND IT

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:06.438 region:rollup2
STE TO THIS DAY REMAINS A.

00:35:03.802 --> 00:35:09.207 region:rollup2
A REGION THAT'S AGRICULTURAL HAS

00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:11.409 region:rollup2
A LOT OF NATURAL. RESOURCE VALUE

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:14.212 region:rollup2
A LOT OF NATURAL. OF FEATURES

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:14.913 region:rollup2
STILL INTACT BUT THAT'S GOOD TO

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:17.182 region:rollup2
HEAR.

00:35:14.913 --> 00:35:18.550 region:rollup2
I THINK I GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE

00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:20.885 region:rollup2
OF THE LAST FEW YEARS ON WITH

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:23.788 region:rollup2
FIRE AND AND AND AND FLOODING IN

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:26.324 region:rollup2
EVEN THE RECENT MUDSLIDES WERE.

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:28.393 region:rollup2
LEARNING THAT TO HER OF OVER

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:29.461 region:rollup2
MANY MANY YEARS WE'VE UP.

00:35:28.393 --> 00:35:31.162 region:rollup2
.

00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:32.530 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO HAVE BUILDING TO

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:33.098 region:rollup2
TAKE PLACE IN SOME AREAS WHERE

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.866 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST REALLY NOT A GOOD

00:35:33.098 --> 00:35:37.135 region:rollup2
IDEA.

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:38.870 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:41.940 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE YET TO REALLY GET A

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:43.575 region:rollup2
HANDLE ON ALTHOUGH A ENOUGH AT

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.509 region:rollup2
THE AREA OF YOUR JURISDICTION IT

00:35:43.575 --> 00:35:45.977 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE A.

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:47.512 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME PROGRESS

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:49.114 region:rollup2
ON THAT WOULD.

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:52.150 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE USEFUL TO.

00:35:49.114 --> 00:35:54.085 region:rollup2
OF FIND A WAY FOR OTHER TO BE

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.520 region:rollup2
SOME STATEWIDE COLLABORATION ON

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:57.288 region:rollup2
WHAT TYPE BEST PRACTICES ARE IN

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.924 region:rollup2
THAT REGARD SO WE BEGIN TO THINK

00:35:57.288 --> 00:36:02.660 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THIS ISSUE HOLISTICALLY.

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:04.696 region:rollup2
A IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.131 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:36:04.696 --> 00:36:08.233 region:rollup2
A.

00:36:06.131 --> 00:36:09.167 region:rollup2
A.

00:36:08.233 --> 00:36:10.669 region:rollup2
IT TOOK TOOK THE TO GRAPPLE WITH

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:11.970 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE FOR A VARIETY OF

00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:13.905 region:rollup2
REASONS

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.573 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:18.076 region:rollup2
REALLY NEED TO MAKE GOTTA.

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:20.478 region:rollup2
OF PROGRESS ON.

00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:22.647 region:rollup2
HAD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:24.449 region:rollup2
TO HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:25.784 region:rollup2
ON THE SPRINGS INTO ACTION.

00:36:24.449 --> 00:36:27.152 region:rollup2
THEN THE.

.

00:36:32.624 --> 00:36:36.194 region:rollup2
LET'S TAKE ROLES AS WE GOT. A

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:36.695 region:rollup2
GOOD IDEA WILL FORMER CORRECT AT

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:11.101 region:rollup2
YEARS TO GET THESE REPLACED.

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:12.936 region:rollup2
LOGISTICALLY STRUCTURALLY THAT

.

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:49.272 region:rollup2
YEAH IT IT SHOULD BE A. IS

01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:51.341 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS THAT.

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.608 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.310 region:rollup2
FORESTRY.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:54.110 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:56.613 region:rollup2
THIS IS A FOREMOST STATE OF

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:58.615 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY IN THE FIRE PROTECTION

01:01:56.613 --> 01:01:59.149 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES. AND IF NOT

01:01:58.615 --> 01:02:01.184 region:rollup2
IN THE WORLD AS AN ENTITY

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:03.353 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:05.822 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THE SERVER JUNIOR

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:06.590 region:rollup2
COUSIN OF A CALIFORNIA.

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:08.458 region:rollup2
IS A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:09.659 region:rollup2
DIVISION.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:12.262 region:rollup2
AND I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:13.797 region:rollup2
LOT OF TALK THERE'S LEGISLATION.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:14.998 region:rollup2
BUT FOREST HELPED IN DEALING

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:16.766 region:rollup2
WITH THESE ISSUES IN A

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:18.969 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE MANNER. ALLOW THIS

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:20.737 region:rollup2
GOES BACK TO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:21.738 region:rollup2
IS REALLY DIFFICULT.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.772 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THE KIND OF FOCUS IT'S

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.074 region:rollup2
NEEDED A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT'S

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.608 region:rollup2
EASY.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:26.009 region:rollup2
THIS IS A MAJOR EMERGENCY

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:27.777 region:rollup2
BITING.

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:29.312 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:31.314 region:rollup2
AT SOME OF THE.

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:33.116 region:rollup2
BASIC PROBLEMS.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:35.251 region:rollup2
STAND BACK GUY IF NOT FIFTEEN

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:36.786 region:rollup2
YEARS EVEN MORE BUT YOU ALL

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:38.388 region:rollup2
SHOULD REMEMBER I LOVE.

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:39.990 region:rollup2
SAYING THIS TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:41.458 region:rollup2
IN THEN HERE THE GAS DOES HAVE

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.460 region:rollup2
MORE IMPACTS.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:44.728 region:rollup2
THAT WAS IN EFFECT FROM NINETEEN

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:47.097 region:rollup2
FORTY SIX TO NINETEEN.

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:48.999 region:rollup2
OF SEVENTY SIX

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.433 region:rollup2
WHEREBY FOREST LANDOWNERS OUR

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:51.801 region:rollup2
TAX EVERY YEAR UNDERSTANDING

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.402 region:rollup2
TIMBER.

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:53.069 region:rollup2
UNTIL THEY CUT SEVENTY PERCENT

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:55.338 region:rollup2
OF IT.

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:57.274 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:59.342 region:rollup2
SO THIS LATITUDE LEGACY PROBLEM

01:02:57.274 --> 01:03:01.044 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TODAY. IN THE FIFTY FIVE

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.945 region:rollup2
AND SIXTY FOUR FLOODS.

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:04.080 region:rollup2
EXACERBATED THAT DAMNED

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:07.484 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.786 region:rollup2
SO AND. THERE WAS LEGISLATION.

01:03:07.484 --> 01:03:12.122 region:rollup2
AND A BECAME LAW TWENTY TWELVE

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:13.723 region:rollup2
AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:15.792 region:rollup2
YOU TAKE NOTE OF THOSE NUMBERS.

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:17.060 region:rollup2
BUT IT GIVES AGO THRESHOLD A

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.294 region:rollup2
WATERSHED MOMENT.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.029 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:21.331 region:rollup2
AT.

01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:23.667 region:rollup2
THAT BILL GAVE A CAPITA FORCE

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:25.602 region:rollup2
FOR A LIABILITY TO LANDOWNERS.

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:27.971 region:rollup2
EXTENDED TIME OF HARVEST PLANS

01:03:25.602 --> 01:03:29.806 region:rollup2
AND CREATED A FUNDING SOURCE FOR

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:31.141 region:rollup2
FORCED REGULATION AND SO CALLED

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.876 region:rollup2

AND IT'S A BRING IN OVER FIFTY

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:41.818 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:42.352 region:rollup2
SO IT ALSO CREATED AND A

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:42.786 region:rollup2
POSITIVE SIDE FOR A LOT OF

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:44.788 region:rollup2
PUBLIC.

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:46.256 region:rollup2

01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:47.357 region:rollup2
INTENSE TO ACTUALLY DEAL FORCE

BEFORE YOU TODAY.

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:57.067 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT IT FROM A BUDGET

01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:59.302 region:rollup2
BASIS AND I FEEL. I AND MANY

01:03:57.067 --> 01:04:00.236 region:rollup2
OTHERS DO ALSO THAT THE

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:01.705 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDING.

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:03.573 region:rollup2
FOR THE FUNDING.

01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:06.443 region:rollup2
THAT IT.

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:07.844 region:rollup2
PROMOTES THE PERSONALITY FOCUS.

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:09.379 region:rollup2

WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:29.432 region:rollup2
SO.

FORCED FELT. BITS OLD ENOUGH AND

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:06.035 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ENOUGH TO HELP TO
