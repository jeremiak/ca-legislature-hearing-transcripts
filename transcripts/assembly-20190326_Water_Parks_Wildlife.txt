MY UNDERSTANDING IS -- MISTER FRASIER'S HERE ALREADY SO WE'LL ASK HIM TO COME UP. IT BY PARDON ME IF I. S. STOP YOUR PRESENTATION IF WE ALL OF A SUDDEN GET A QUORUM. AND THAT WE WE CAN TAKE ACTION ON ON THE ITEM WELCOME THE MORNING THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. AB TWO EIGHTY FOUR IS A SIMPLE BILL THAT WILL ENHANCE YOUTH ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS. BY DELETING THE SUNSET ON THE JUNIOR HUNTING LICENCES AGE EXTENSION ADOPTED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH MADE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YOUTH -- ELIGIBLE FOR A REDUCE COSTS JUNIOR HUNTING LICENSE. CALIFORNIA LIKE OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY FACES A DECLINE IN HUNTING PARTICIPATION. ACCESS TO REDUCE COSTS YOUR HUNTER LICENSES WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE OUTDOORS COMMUNITY AS ONE STRATEGY TO GET MORE YOUTH INVOLVED. IN CONSERVATION AND HUNTING ACTIVITIES. SAYS THE LICENSE WAS INTRODUCED YOUTH HUNTERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE INCREASED IN NUMBER. IN FACT THE JUNIOR HUNTING LICENSE BROUGHT IN MORE YOUTH HUNTERS IN ANY YEAR SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX A THIRTY YEAR HIGH. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE JUNIOR HUNTERS. THE JUNIOR HUNTERS -- IT BROUGHT IN WERE PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED DUE TO COST. THE YOUTH LICENSE EXPOSE THESE KIDS TO OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON OTHERWISE. THE JUNIOR HIGH THE JUNIOR LICENSE HAS HAD AN UNMISTAKABLY POSITIVE IMPACT. WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN THE NUMBERS AND FROM THE TESTIMONY YOU WILL HEAR TODAY. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION THAT IMPROVES AND PROMOTES ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS FOR OUR YOUTH. AND NOW I'VE PRESENT WITH OF ARE SUPPORTED SO MARKEDLY FROM CALIFORNIA WONDERFUL. THANK YOU SOME IN FRAZIER YEAH MARKEDLY CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION WE WORKED A WITH ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER ON THE ORIGINAL BILL -- OTHERS POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW FOLLOW FOLLOWING CALIFORNIA'S WE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE ALSO CHANGE ITS FEDERAL. YOUTH HONEY AN AGE REQUIREMENT FROM. FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SO THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED -- MANY OTHER STATES ALSO ALLOW. SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS. TO PURCHASE A REDUCED FEE -- HUNTING LICENCES. THIS INCLUDES NEIGHBORING OREGON AND ARIZONA. AND EVEN -- OTHER STATES THROUGHOUT THE WEST I KNOW MANY OF THEM ALSO HAVE THESE LICENSES. THE MAIN BENEFIT FOR THE JUNIOR LICENSE HOLDER IS REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN SPECIAL MENTORED YOUTH HEIGHTS -- THAT HELPED INTRODUCE THEM TO THE OUTDOORS. THIS HELPS TO ADDRESS -- THE SURVEY DATA FROM HUNTERS THAT SUGGESTS THAT. ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY AND PARTICULARLY GETTING PEOPLE OUT -- WHO ARE ADULTS THAT HELPED TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE OUTDOORS AFFECTS HUNTING PARTICIPATION SO WE'RE TRYING TO GO OFF OF THE DATA THAT -- IS ALREADY OUT THERE -- BUT ALSO THE REDUCED FEE -- COSTS THE JUNIOR LICENSE OBVIOUSLY IT'LL HELP YOUTH HUNTERS BECAUSE THEIR TYPICALLY AT AN AGE WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE AN INCOME AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO SPEND A LOT ON THEIR HUNTING ACTIVITIES. SO WORTH IT WE THINK WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH AND OF COURSE WE HAVE THE WHOLE ARE THREE EFFORT GOING ON WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM AS WELL. AND WE THINK THIS IS JUST ONE TOOL BUT A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP. HOPEFULLY -- INCREASE HUNTER PARTICIPATION OVER LONG TERM OR LONG TERM -- SO WE THANK ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER FOR HIS WORK ON THIS AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OTHER. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE GRASSLAND WATER DISTRICT IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GUIDES AND SPORTSMEN'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT.

GROUP AND SUPPORT THANK ANY OTHER [inaudible] ONE TWENTY FOUR IN OPPOSITION. THAT THAT IS THE QUESTION. MEMBERS OF GREAT. I JUST LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND ASK IF HE WAS TAKING ANY A CO AUTHORS. YES SIR WOULD BE HONORED TO HAVE YOU AS CLUB. THAT WOULD BE. GREAT THANK YOU [inaudible] OUR QUESTIONS. THE BILL. MOTION. WE HAVE A CORD. FOR WORKING ON THE FACT [inaudible] FOR THE THANK YOU MISTER PRITCHARD TIME FOLLOWED BY. MORNING WHAT GOOD MORNING. YOU HAVE TO PASS -- COMMITTEE AMENDMENT RECOMMENDATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- CAN I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK IN ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS -- AS WE ALL KNOW SITTING IN HERE. SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES OF CALIFORNIA WATER MANAGEMENT CAN BE FOUND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WHETHER WE'RE TALKING NOT CONTAMINATE DRINKING WATER OR OVERDRAFT GROUND WATER BASINS THE SILICON VALLEY NEED THE ABILITY TO USE EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. A RECENT PPA SEE STUDY FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE OF WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND THEY NOTE THAT THE ONLY FEASIBLE WAY TO BRING OUR GROUND WATER BASINS BACK INTO BALANCE IS TO A COMBINED APPROACH. OF AUGMENTING SUPPLY IN REDUCING DEMAND. THE STORY OF OUR LIVES. WHAT A BEFORE FOUR ONE ATTEMPTS TO DO IS BRING THE CONVERSATION TO THE FOREFRONT BY SUGGESTING THAT ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION? THAT CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE BENEFITS IS GROUND WATER RECHARGE. WE KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION WE ALL KNOW WHAT BEEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION FOR YEARS NOW -- BUT AS THE SIGMA DEADLINES COME UP UPON US AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE TOOK A PASS ON IT BECAUSE IT WOULD IF IT IS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION. BUT AS FOR YEARS HAVE NOW PASSED AND I THINK WE'RE BACK TO HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND NEED TO FIND WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD -- WITH ME HERE TODAY -- IS MARIANN ORNAMENT FROM RC RC AND DANNY MERKLEY OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS AND WITH OUR HOPES THAT WE CONTINUE. TO CREATED OPEN AND HONEST DIALOGUE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AND COMPLEXITIES FACING EACH OF OUR REGION'S UNIQUE WATER ISSUES THANK. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARYANN WARMER I'M WITH THAT RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THIRTY SIX OF THE STATE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS POLICY QUESTION AND SHE NOTED THIS CAN BE AND HAS PROVEN TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> CONVERSATION. WITH IMPLICATIONS TO WATER RIGHT HOLDERS AS WELL AS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS THROUGH THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACTED WITH ADOPTED BY. US THE PEOPLE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO YOUR LEADERSHIP. AS ALREADY NOTED SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES HAVE POINTED OUT THE CHALLENGES FACING THESE EFFORTS AND THE RISK OF FAILURE CAN MEAN THE FOUNDING OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES. IT IS OUR VIEW THAT DESIGNATING GROUNDWATER RECHARGES THE BENEFICIAL USE IS A KEY TOOL TO BRING RK GROUND WATER BASINS INTO COMPLIANCE. BALANCE AND PROTECTING THE RESOURCE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE CHALLENGE WILL BE FINDING THE RIGHT MECHANISM THAT IS PROTECTIVE OF WATER RIGHT HOLDERS AS WELL AS THE DOWNSTREAM USERS. THE PASSAGE OF SIGMA HAS CREATED THE FRAMEWORK FOR COUNTIES WATER AGENCIES AND THE COMMUNITY OF STAKEHOLDERS. TO COLLABORATE ON IN THE CREATION OF A GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN. WHICH BEST MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES THE ECONOMIES THAT DEPEND UPON THAT WATER. AND THE STEWARDSHIP OF CALIFORNIA'S OUT AQUIFER'S. CIGNA ALSO PROVIDES A FORM TO DO SO THAT AS TRANSPARENT. AND PROVIDES THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCALLY DRIVEN SUCCESS. STATED ANOTHER WAY GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ENSURING THAT SIGMA IS PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED. AND SHOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ANY FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING RECHARGE AS A BENEFICIAL USE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S. EGGMAN LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ADVANCE THIS POLICY QUESTION FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ON THE AQUIFER'S WE DEPEND UPON THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS -- AND GAINING BERKELEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU -- LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT -- FORM YOU'RE REALLY APPRECIATES ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADMINS WILLING TO TAKE ON THIS -- TOUGH ISSUE IN IN RECENT YEARS. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE SUSPEND WILL GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. FARM BUREAU AND COUNTY FARM BUREAU'S HAD SPENT THOUSANDS OF HOURS -- AND ATTENDED HUNDREDS OF MEETINGS TO MAKE SURE THE ACT IS SUCCESSFUL. FOR THIS REASON WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF DOES ANY GROUND WATER RECHARGE AS A BENEFICIAL USED AS ONE KEY TOOL -- TO BRING YOUR GROUND WATER BASINS IN THE BALANCE WHILE PROTECTING. MORE JUNIOR WATER RIGHT HOLDERS AND DOWNSTREAM WATER USERS. WE STILL HAVE. WORK TO DO IN PROVIDING THE FRAMEWORK NECESSARY -- TO BENEFICIALLY UC'S EXCESS FLOWS WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE -- TO RECHARGE OUR BASINS AND OFFERING PROTECTIONS FOR FOR ALL WATER USERS. WERE HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS -- SO THAT A. B.. FOUR FOUR ONE CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE. BENEFITS BOOK GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AS WELL AS FLOOD PROTECTION. IN WET YEARS LIKE THIS -- WHEN WATER IS COMING OFF THE LANDSCAPE -- IN SHEETS AND FLOWING OUT THROUGH OUR FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEMS IT'S ABSOLUTELY INCUMBENT UPON US -- TO RECAPTURE IT FOR RECHARGE. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN CAPTURE WATER. IT IS GOING TO HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS MOVE FORWARD IN TERMS OF WATER SUPPLY AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TOOL. OF FOR IMPLEMENTING SIGMA. AB FOUR FOUR ONE WILL ALSO HELP BUREAU OF RECLAMATION TO RELEASE WATER FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE TO THOSE THAT HAVE STORED. AND PAID FOR WATER RIGHT NOW. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE DRIVE VOTE TO KEEP THIS MEASURE AND THE DIALOGUE MOVING FORWARD -- I REALLY HIT THIS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE WITH A PRETTY BROAD BRUSH SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS -- THANK YOU OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WANTED TO SPEAK WITH HIM FOR HI DOMINIC TOMARI FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER EXCHANGE CONTRACTORS WATER AUTHORITY. WE JUST GOT IN A POSITION ON THIS ON FRIDAY IT'S A POSITION OF SUPPORT AND THEY'LL BE LETTER TO FOLLOW BUT I JUST WANT TO DO -- ISSUE OR SUPPORT POSITION HERE TODAY THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] WHAT ELSE? I THOSE ARE ONES BEACON OPPOSITION. PLEASE -- COMPORT GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M KATHY VIçT TELE THE EXECUTIVE LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND REGRETTABLY METROPOLITAN ANOTHER AGENCIES AS NOTED HONDA LETTER SUBMITTED TO THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE MUST OPPOSE A BEFORE FOUR ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SUSAN EGGMAN. AB FOUR FOUR ONE FAILS TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT PERMANENT UNDERGROUND STORAGE IS IMPLEMENTED IN A REASONABLE MANNER. IN MANY AREAS OF THE STATE THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO RECOVERING GROUNDWATER LEVELS AND LEAVING WATER IN THE GROUND. AND THE GROUND AQUIFER PERMANENTLY HOWEVER THE WATER RIGHTS OF THOSE POTENTIALLY AFFECTED BY SUCH ACTIONS. MUST BE RECOGNIZED AND PROTECTED. THIS IS DANIEL GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN RECOGNIZE THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER AND PROTECTION OF EXISTING WATER RIGHTS. AND A BEFORE FORTY ONE SHOULD DO SO AS WELL. THERE'S ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIAL MISUSE AN ADVERSE IMPACTS OF SURFACE WATER IS PERMANENTLY STORED WITHOUT APPROPRIATE REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. PARTIES SHOULD HAVE TO ESTABLISH WITH THE BOARD THAT PERMANENT UNDERGROUND WATER STORAGE IS NECESSARY TO AVOID SALT WATER INTRUSION OR SUBSIDENCE OR ANOTHER IMPORTANT BENEFICIAL EFFECT. TO ENSURE OUR STATE'S AQUIFER'S CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY WATER SUPPLIES. UNCHECKED THE DIVERSION OF WATER FOR UNDER BROWN STORAGE WHETHER A NEW OR EXISTING APPROPRIATION MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OTHER BENEFICIAL USES OF WATER FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE RECREATION COMMERCE OR USE BY A DOWNSTREAM DIVERT HER. AND APPROVING THE APPROPRIATION OF SURFACE WATER FOR PERMANENT STORAGE THE STATE WATER BOARD MUST CONFIRM THAT THE FLOWS ARE NOT ALREADY OTHERWISE APPROPRIATED OR DIVERTED AT TIMES WHEN THE FEDERAL CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. AND STATE WATER PROJECT ARE REQUIRED TO RELEASE SUPPLEMENTAL PROJECT WATER TO MEET WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES IN THE DELTA WATERSHED. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE AB FOR ONE AND URGE THE COMMITTEES NO VOTE ON THE MEASURE [inaudible] THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT MANNING ON BEHALF OF MY HOBBY WATER AGENCY IN WATSON'S WATER DISTRICT -- THIS IS ABOUT THE FOURTH TIME I THINK A TESTIFIED ON THIS BILL. IN THIS FORM -- AND A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE WORKED WITH MISS SEGMENT INNER STAFF TO REACH A RESOLUTION AND UNFORTUNATELY -- THE BILL DIDN'T PROCEED AT THAT POINT -- LAST YEAR A NUMBER OF A SPENT EXTENSIVE TIME MOST OF THE YOU'RE WORKING ON MISTER RANDALL IS BILL WHICH THE CHAIRS CARRYING IN A DIFFERENT FORM TODAY. WORKING WITH VERY STAKEHOLDERS AND THE WATER BOARD ON COMPLEX WATER RIGHTS ISSUES -- UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL IN THIS FORM DOESN'T IN CAPS LATE. BAIT FOR MAJOR THEMES THAT ARE ANY BILL IN THIS AREA REALLY NEEDS TO ENCOMPASS -- FIRST IS THAT THE BILL SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO TIMES WHEN THEY'RE FLOOD FLOWS. MEANING THERE'S ACCESS WATER IN THE SYSTEM -- THAT IS RECOGNIZABLE TO EVERYONE -- SECOND THE LANGUAGE US HAVE ADEQUATE -- PROTECTIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WATER MEANING FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE. THIRD THE LANGUAGE HAS TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY OF PROTECTIONS -- SO WHETHER IT BE SAILING LEVELS OR WHATEVER THEIR NUMERICAL STANDARDS THAT HAVE TO BE MET. AND FOURTH A AND AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT HAS TO PROTECT OTHER WATER RIGHT USERS. AS AN EXAMPLE -- SOMEONE IN THE DELTA COULD DIVERT WATER UNDER THIS BILL IS WRITTEN. ESTABLISH A OF OUR WATER RIGHTS SIMPLY BY TAKING WATER -- THAT SHOULD BE IN THE SYSTEM FOR THE ENVIRONMENT RELEASED BY THE STATE OR FEDERAL CONTRACTORS. TAKING THAT WATER OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND PUTTING IN IN THE GROUND. THAT LEADS TO THE EXPORT COMMUNITY HOW MANY PUT ADDITIONAL WATER AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. WHILE SOMEONE ELSE IS TAKEN WATER OUT. AND NOW SALAS FOR WATER RIGHT THAT'S NOT A PALATABLE SITUATION. ON WE'D SUGGESTS THAT -- YOU KNOW FOR A BILL TO MOVE FORWARD. IT IT REALLY CAN ENCOMPASS THOSE PRINCIPLES AND STILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE GROUNDWATER STORAGE FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHERS WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MONICA MILLER REPRESENTING THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT ALSO KNOWN AS SALLY WATER AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHRYSTIE FOR A WITH THE THREE VALLEY'S MISCIBLE WATER DISTRICT ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY NWT THANK YOU. GINGER MEMBERS JACK WHILE GOING UP IT ALSO IN OPPOSITION ON BEHALF OF KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY LONG BEACH WATER DEPARTMENT AND THE SAN BURDEN YOUR VALLEY MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS PUBLIC OURS WITH ENVIRONMENT DEFENSE FUND I'M GOING LAST BECAUSE I WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL RIGHT NOW. I PROBABLY SHOULD TRY TO SPEAKER THERE BUT HERE I AM -- I THINK WE'VE HAD THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS OFFICE AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF THE BILL. AND THE PRIOR BILLS AS WELL I THINK WE'RE FULLY ON BOARD WITH THEM. XCELERATED GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE I THINK WE THIS IS A SIMILAR BUILDING WITH. YOU AS OTHERS HAVE SAID HAD DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE THE PAST FEW YEARS. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT TWEAKING OR CHANGING BENEFITS ARE USED AS ATTENTION. SPECIFICALLY REMOVING THE FORFEITURE PROVISIONS TO WATER RIGHTS SO WHEN WATER IS NOT. USE FOR GREAT IN FIVE YEARS. UNDER THIS BILL UNDER THE CURRENT FORM THE BILL WOULD NOT BE FORFEITED. AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT IN THE UNDERSTAND THAT WE WANT TO PUT WATER IN THE GROUND FIRST USE OF STOP SEE WATER INTRUSION FOR OTHER REASONS. YOU THINK THAT COULD BE THE PERSON SENATE SO WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS AND TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT THERE'S OTHER YOU THERE'S OTHER EFFORTS AT THE WATER BOARD AND AT THE PART AND WATER RESOURCES AND SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED. TO TO DO THIS -- SO WE'LL KEEP TALKING IN A PUT SOME THOUGHTS DOWN IN WRITING. RELATED EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU UP WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE POINTS WERE MADE WELL I I THINK SOME OF THE POINTS MADE ARE ARE. ARE SALIENT AND I APPRECIATE THAT MISTER MANNING YOU KNOW POINTING TO THE TENACITY OF THE EFFORT BEHIND THIS BILL -- IT IS NOT EASY YOU KNOW WATER WATER IS NEVER EASY BUT WE KNOW THAT IF WE KEEP ON DRAINING AQUIFER'S AND KEEP ON TAKING IT OUT WITHOUT HAVING A PLAN TO RECHARGE THEM -- THAT'S NOT HEALTHY AND WE WE CERTAINLY INVITE AND THAT'S THE GET THE POINT OF THE BILL TO BRING PEOPLE BACK TO THE TABLE TO SOMETHING. AT I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT IS VERY HARD TO THREAD THE NEEDLE ON THIS BUT WE ARE COMMITTED. TO DOING THAT. AND MAKING SURE THAT JUNIOR WATER RIGHTS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TAKE FROM PEOPLE BUT WE KNOW THAT IS IMPORTANT YOU CAN'T AGAIN JUST DID THE IMAGE OF A STRIKE JUST CAN'T KEEP TAKING IT OUT. WITHOUT PUTTING WATER BACK IN AND THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY SYSTEM WHICH WAS THE THE WHOLE POINT OF OF SIGMA AND KNOWING THAT WE NEED -- TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN. SO WE WERE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THE BILL AND AS WAS MENTIONED THERE'S ANOTHER VEHICLE AS WELL THAT WE CORRECT UP TO INTEGRATE YOU INTO THAT CONVERSATION WE HAVE A QUORUM KNOWN SO I'M GONNA CALL THE ROLL. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION ON YOUR BILL. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. EDUARDO GARCIA HASN'T GALLAGHER [inaudible] BIGELOW [inaudible] CHOI [inaudible] TO DALLY. FRIEDMAN. CRISTINA GARCIA YEAH GLORIA [inaudible] KALRA [inaudible] LEVINE [inaudible] BLANCA RUBIO [inaudible] SALAS [inaudible] WOOD. OKAY WE'LL FOR WE HAVE QUESTION FOR A MISSPELLING SO -- I NEVER KNOWN YOU TO SHY OFF OF THE TOUGH. BILL AND THIS IS REALLY A TOUGH BILL THERE ARE A LOT OF FIRST I COMMEND YOU FOR EVEN. TRYING THIS OUT AGAIN -- IN MY DISTRICT WE ARE FACED WITH -- THIS IS SEGMENT IT'S NOT REALLY WORKING WITH THEM IN DIFFERENT PARTS I GUESS WHAT MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE RECHARGE DIFFERENTLY AND SO WE HAVE -- THEY'RE KINDA GROUNDWATER BASINS AND DOLLIES AND ENDEAVOR TO TOUCH OUR SOULS WERE YOU CAN AND CAN'T RECHARGE SENIOR WATER RIGHTS AND CONJUNCTIVE USE I MEAN I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ALREADY I KNOW BUT WHAT. WHAT IS THIS BILL GOING TO GO TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE? AT THAT BUT I FIRST WANTED LIKE TO APPROPRIATIONS OKAY SO THIS IS REALLY ARE SHOT AT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY. REAL DIALOGUE ON THE POLICY THEN SO -- FOR ME I THINK THAT -- I'M A REALLY. KIND OF DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M A LAND ON THIS BILL I I HAVEN'T OF STAIN ON IT BECAUSE IT'S THERE'S JUST SO MANY UNANSWERED. QUESTIONS AND I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN TRIED MANY TIMES SO I GUESS -- WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON -- MAYBE. DIVIDE UP THE STATE AND MAYBE SOME REGIONS AND MAYBE SEE IN SOME BECAUSE IT YOU MOST YOUR OPPOSITION IS COMING FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND AND THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT I I AGREE THAT WE NEED -- TO THEY WERE AREAS WE CAN RECHARGE WE NEED TO RECHARGE AS BASES IN THE VALLEY -- YOU KNOW PORTABILITY IN THE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN. WHICH IS YOUR AREA ISN'T IT. RIGHT PACKED YOUR ARE YOU MORE OF YOUR DISTRICT ARE DIFFERENT RESIDENTS SO. I'M I'M JUST KIND OF WONDER IS THERE IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY MAYBE TO LOOK AT THE STATE AND REGIONS OF HANDLING THE RECHARGE IN THE THOSE THINGS. IN DIFFERENT WAY. FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS THE STATE. I'LL TAKE A STAB AT ANSWERING THAT MISTER DALI MERION WARMER DOWN WITH RC RC. WE THINK THAT THERE IS SOME OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THOSE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS. FIRST AND FOREMOST IN THEIR REPORT RISK REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES -- ARE IMMINENT -- AT THE END OF JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR. SO WE THINK THAT WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE. WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT VEHICLE AT LEAST TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY START SCOPING OUT. ON GIVEN THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL YET TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO START SCOPING OUT WHAT MIGHT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF LOCALLY DRIVEN SIGMA. PROGRAMS TO HELP US. MAINTAIN THE AQUIFER'S INTO THE FUTURE RIGHT NOW PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WE HAVE SOME REAL CHALLENGES AND WE JUST BE THIS IS ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. SO I GUESS THE ANSWER IS IN SOME WAYS YES I THINK ONE ONE PEOPLE CRAFT THEIR PLANS THEN IF THEY HAD THIS IS A TOOL AND MET CERTAIN CRITERIA. THEN I THINK WOULD BE ABLE TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO I THINK THOSE ARE ALL CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE VERY OPEN TO HAVING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE FACED WITH IS THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING TO ACTUALLY EVEN IMPLEMENT THE SIGNAL PLAN AND MOST OF MOST OF THE GROUND WATER USERS MY DISTRICT ARE AG AND THEN SMALL WATER DISTRICTS. THAT TERM ARE STRAPPED FOR FUNDING TO START OUT WITH SO THAT THE SIGNAL REGULATION IS. IMPAIR DAM FOR MAIL TO YOU YOU HAVE PROP TWO EIGHTEEN WHERE YOU CAN'T REYES CAN'T RAISE REVENUES AND QUITE FRANKLY SOME OF THOSE CAN. WATER SYSTEMS CAN'T CAN'T AFFORD IT. AND SO WE'RE STOCK IT WERE IN A BOX WE WE HAVE. A GREAT AND IN THAT SUPPOSEDLY AN IMPACT IMPAIR GROUNDWATER BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROVE THE MONITORING WHICH IS AN HASN'T BEEN DONE FOR EVER. AND SO IT WE'RE KIND OF IN A BOX AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET US OUT OF THAT BOX AND MOVE FORWARD I OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT. TO OVER DROPPED OUR GROUNDWATER -- IN. AND WE WANT TO RECHARGE WHERE WE CAN IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS THREE CHARGES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS AND SO ANYWAY I'M CUTS IT'S DIFFICULT YES YES. HERE QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY -- ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- EGGMAN I REALLY APPRECIATE -- YOU BRING THE BILL FORD BUT AS YOU KNOW WERE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND OUR ISSUES ARE. OF VERY COMPLEX AS WELL AND I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE FOR IT FOR YOUR DISTRICT AND I AM ALSO WOULD LIKE -- AND I'M HEARING IT HERE YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING IT'S OBVIOUSLY -- A NOR THAN CALIFORNIA VERSUS SENDING CALIFORNIA ISSUE I DON'T I HOPE IT WOULD. BE DIFFERENT I'M BY THE A LOT OF MY FOLKS DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SOME OF A MERRY HERE -- HAVE ISSUES WITH THE BILL SO AT THIS TIME I WILL -- SUPPORTED -- GIVEN THAT YOU'VE GIVEN THE COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE -- LIKE -- THE OLDEN DAYS OF WATERS FOR YOUR FIGHTING WITH USE FOR DRINKING THE OTHER WAY AROUND BUT I DON'T WANT THIS TO BECOME A A HUGE FIGHT I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME -- SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS. TO TO WORK WITH US THANK YOU. AND I WOULD JUST -- I'LL JUST REITERATE THAT IS ANYBODY KNOWS BEEN AROUND HERE FOR AWHILE THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR AWHILE AND WE CAN'T GET TO SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT WE WE DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T TRY TO FORCE ISSUE AND PUSH IT FORWARD. YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE IT AS A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I SEE IT AS A CALIFORNIA ISSUE AND IT'S WATER ISSUE AND IT'S ALL OF OUR ISSUE -- WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE THE RICHEST FARMLAND IN THE WORLD THAT IS THEN WITH BROWN THAT WATER THAT IS OVER DRAFTED WE KNOW THAT THERE'S PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. AND THIS IS JUST PART OF THE CONVERSATION THE PERSON WITH THE BIGGEST YOU KNOW. STRAW SHOULDN'T GET THE CHEN ALWAYS BE ABLE TO GET THE MOST WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE GROUND IS HEALTHY THAT THE AQUIFER IS OUR FULL. IN UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF DIFFERENT BASINS HAVING DIFFERENT ISSUES. THAT. I JUST WANTED -- TO DANNY MERKLEY WITH CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT -- IF. FARM BUREAU SAW THIS IS A NORTH SOUTH ISSUE I WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE -- LARGEST SAG ORGANIZATIONS CITY CALIFORNIA WITH MEMBERS -- FROM THE OREGON BORDER DOWN TO THE MEXICAN BORDER. AND THAT'S WHY -- WERE WORKING WITH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROTECTIONS FOR JUNIOR WATER RIGHT HOLDERS IN DOWNSTREAM WATER USERS ARE THERE IN THIS MEASURE. AND IF I MIGHT ADD LIKEWISE TO THE FARM BUREAU WE'RE NOT A REGIONAL REGIONAL ORGANIZATION WE HAVE MEMBER COUNTIES FROM. THE MEXICAN BORDER TO THE OREGON BORDER AS WELL WHAT I WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT WE DO THIS MORE AS AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR US TO ROUTE RESTORE AQUIFER'S AND MAINTAINING THOSE AQUIFER'S IS GOOD FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA WHEREVER WERE LOCATED WE HAVE A PRETTY INTEGRATED WATER. INTO INFRASTRUCTURE -- IT THESE DAYS AND WE WOULD LOOK THIS LOOK AT THIS AS A WAY FOR COMMUNITIES THROUGH CIGNA. TO MANAGE THEIR BASINS IN A WAY THAT'S NOT ONLY GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY CENTER DEPENDENT UPON THEM BUT BIRD THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEPENDENT UPON THEM AS WELL. ALL RIGHT I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COME IN HERE PLEASE STOP. THANK CHAIR I ALSO WHILE -- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE ARE. THE OBJECTIONS ARE RAISED A BY THE ALMOST TWO DAYS OF IN CALIFORNIA WATER -- DISHING METROPOLITAN NOW -- WATER WAS OF IN CALIFORNIA SLANG CALIFORNIA WATER DISTRICT -- WHAT WATER COALITION OUR WAY GOING TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE CONCERNS AND -- IN THAT YOU HAVE HEARD DOWN FROM THOSE GREW UP OPPOSITION GROUP. THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT OBJECTIONS THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE AND WE HAVE MOVED THE BILL ALONG TO THE POINT WHERE IN IN THE PAST. MOST OF YOU THE PERSON PEOPLE YOU HEARD OBJECTING HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME TO A COMFORTABLE PLACE BUT THEN. WHEN WE GET TO TOO COMFORTABLE WITH SOME WE WE LOSE? OF OUR OF OUR FRIENDS SO IT IS A I AM COMMITTED TO TRYINGTO WORK THIS OUT IS A IT IS A COMPLEX ISSUE -- BUT PEOPLE COMING TO THE TABLE AND DISCUSSING IT AND EVERYBODY BUT I THINK BEING CONCERNED ABOUT. WATER CALIFORNIA WILL GET THEIR THE ONE THE ONE THING I MIGHT ADD TO THAT IS -- NOW MR GARCIA'S MEASURE THAT TALKS TO THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FORMALIZE -- FOR THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY WE THINK IT'S ALL COMPLIMENTARY AND THAT AS WE TALK THIS THROUGH. TO GATHER THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THIS ISSUE TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF OF IMPLEMENTATION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU HELLO WITH A LONGER FORM.

THAT'S ENOUGH IN THIS COMMITTEE ANYMORE. BUT I WANTED TO I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB. FIVE FIFTY SIX THE BILL THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE OUTER EXPERIENCES FOR DISADVANTAGED YOUTH AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING. THIS BILL IS SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR'S AB TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN WHICH THIS COMMITTEE HAS SEEN BEFORE AND ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND MADE IT TO THE GOVERNOR SOUTH LAST YEAR. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DISADVANTAGED URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE LITTLE TO NO ACCESS TO OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES. EVEN WHEN THEY LIVE MINUTES AWAY FROM THE SPACES FOR EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICTS OF IN MY DISTRICT THE LA PARK SCORE WAS 41% FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN LA. WHO DID NOT HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO PARKS A UCLA IN SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY STUDY FOUND THAT THE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION? HI ACOSTA PARKING AND LIMITED ACCOMMODATIONS POST SOME OF THE LARGEST BARRIERS FOR COMMUNITY ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS. OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES HAVE NUMEROUS BENEFITS FOR OUR YOUTH. IT HAS LED TO HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES BETTER EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH. PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS CAN ENCOURAGE GREATER CIVIC ENGAGEMENT UNDERSTANDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND CAN HELP FOSTER FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND PROTECTION. AB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL LAST THE NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY WITH CREATING A COMMUNITY ACCESS PROGRAM. TO ENABLE CALIFORNIANS TO REACHING UTILIZE NATURAL EDUCATION AND RECREATIONAL RESOURCES. THIS BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF A GRANT PROGRAM PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR INNOVATIVE. TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO FOSTER MORE ACCESS TO THOSE WHO ARE OFTEN DENIED THESE EXPERIENCE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS JOSE GONZALEZ THE FOUNDER OF LATINO A DOORS AND ONE OF THEM WE DON'T KNOW ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR POLICY FOR THE AUDUBON. CALIFORNIA TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF THIS BILL. RIGHT. GOOD MORNING ONE IS THIS -- GOOD MORNING TRACY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT'S MY NAME'S JOSE GONZALEZ AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE TEAM OF DOORS THAT AS A SPONSOR AND SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURTEOUS -- AB -- FIVE FIFTY SIX LATINO DOORS IS A UNIQUE ORGANIZATION THAT WAS FOUNDED HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WORKING COOPERATIVE WITH MANY OF THE STATE -- AGENCIES AND PARKS HYSTRIX IF FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING OUTER EXPERIENCES ALL THE WAY FROM HUMBOLDT TO FAMILIES AND KIDS DOWN TO SAN DIEGO. AND OUR WORK IS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A NATIONAL COMMUNITY OF LEADERS IN CONSERVATION OUTRAGE CATIONS WHICH WE ARE DOING. THE KEY THING AROUND THAT IS THAT ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS NATURE SEEMS LIKE IT OUT TO BE A BIRTHRIGHT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS GIVEN THE HISTORY -- AND THE LEADERSHIP THAT IS DEMONSTRATED AND IT'S WOVEN THROUGH THE LANDSCAPES MANY OF US ARE EXTREMELY FORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE BEEN TWO OR CAN EASILY ACCESS ECOSYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE BIODIVERSITY HONESTLY THAT KIND OF THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. I AIN'T ARE WE HAVE WORLD CLASS STATE PARKS IN NATIONAL PARKS ICONIC COASTLINES AND THEIR UNIQUE FLORA AND FAUNA. AND FOR US IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN HAVE A CONNECTION TO THAT. THIS IS WHY AB FIVE FIFTY SIX IS IMPORTANT ENHANCING DISADVANTAGED YOUTH ACCESS TO OUR CHRIS BURY SAYS IN ORDER TO CREATE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION EXPERIENCES THAT OUR PUBLIC LANDS IS VITAL TO CONTINUE. TO ENSURE THAT THE NEXT GENERATION LIKE GENERATION BEFORE IN THE GENERATION NOW -- THEY WERE SUPPORTING THIS GENERATION ENVIRONMENTAL STORAGE TO CONTINUE THE WORK TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON A CONSERVATION SUCCESSES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. SO IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS IT IS JUST AS CRITICAL FOR THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE ACCESS THE PLACE TO ALL DEPARTMENT AND AGENCIES. UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AS A FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS THAT THE NO DOOR STRONG SUPPORT AB FIVE FIFTY SIX AND EXTENT IN ITS THINK WE'LL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR LEADERSHIP ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR IBOOK OKAY AT THIS TIME WILL. PUT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS ONE OF THE MEAT ON A WITHOUT ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA -- WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB -- FIVE FIVE SIX FIRST OFF WE WANT TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO. FOR TACKLING THIS PRESSING ISSUE ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS. SHOULD BE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO A CALIFORNIANS BUT ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE LITTLE TO NO ACCESS TO EXPERIENCE THE OUTDOORS. AT AUDUBON CALIFORNIA WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS THROUGH CENTERS IN CHAPTER NETWORK -- OUR CHAPTER NETWORKS ARE SPECIFICALLY THE WORK THAT WE DO THROUGH ONE OF OUR CENTERS WHICH IS AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER CAREERS AS A DISTRICT. ADEPTS PARK IS WE AIM TO INSPIRE PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTAND AND CARE FOR THE LOCAL NAY OUR NATURAL WORLD AROUND THEM. THIS NATURE BASED EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT THAT PART DUBS PARK ARE DESIGNED TO ENGAGE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE OUTDOOR WORLD. AND GIVE THEM A PERSONAL STAKE IN ITS PROTECTION BY MAKING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES RELEVANT TO THEIR LIVES WE UNDERSTAND THAT HOWEVER THAT THE TRANSFORMATIVE NATURE OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE OUTDOORS. OUR HE CAN BE SEEN FIRST HAND BUT MANY MANY OF THESE FAMILIES AND YOUNG PEOPLE -- UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE THAT -- THEY THEY LACK THE RESOURCES -- MA'AM. NOT ONLY IN WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO. WITHIN. SURVEY XIN ORGANIZATION NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION LIKE OURS. THAT. THERE THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION. OUR DOLLARS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND THAT MAKES IT A CHALLENGE FOR COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS. THESE THINGS. AB FIVE FIVE SIX WOULD CHANGE THAT BY A AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO SAID. FOR BY HAVING THE CREATION OF A GRANT PROGRAM THAT WILL FOSTER. MORE ACCESS TO MORE PEOPLE AND AS WE CONTINUE TO TACKLE THESE.

GOOD MORNING MELISSA ROMERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEE NO ONE ANYONE WISHING. TO THE POSITION BRING BACK TO DICE ANY QUESTIONS THE AUTHOR. THIS BIGELOW WHILE BY DOCTOR CHOI. AGAIN THANKS TO THE OFFICE AUTHOR FOR REASONING THE BILL. OF A QUESTION I HAVE IS THIS BILL YOU YOU RENT LAST YEAR. IT WAS PRESENTED AND THEN IT GOT AWAY TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT HE SAID. THE GOVERNOR IN HIS VETO MESSAGE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT. THERE'S ALREADY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS THIS. THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR MANY OF THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WERE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IS THERE. WHAT DO YOU SEE IS THE COST FOR THIS AND WHY DO YOU WANT TO SINGLE OUT WHEN IT THERE'S ALREADY A PROGRAM? AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THAT. SO WE CAN DISCUSS ISSUES ON FISCAL IMPACT AND APPROPRIATIONS THE THE POLICY OF THIS IS TO ALIGN VOTER INTENT WITH PROP SIXTY EIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GRANT PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE WHETHER IT'S RULE URBAN AREAS LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET KIDS TO THE PLACES THAT THEY NEED TO BE IN A LINE ON WHAT THE VOTERS WANT. FOR SIXTY EIGHT AND GIVEN THAT SAID IT IT. THERE WAS ANOTHER MEASURE THAT CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE PRIOR. AND THIS THE SAME. ONE WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IS AN A GROWING. QUESTION FOR US TO FACE AS A POLICY AS WE START PUTTING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE INSIDE OUR PARK SYSTEM THE PARK SYSTEM THAT'S NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE RED -- FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. HOW ARE WE GOING TO GIVE THEM A MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE WHEN MANY OF THE AREAS ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE CLOSED BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS AND A LACK OF FUNDING? WE SEEM TO HAVE AGAINST THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SAFE PLACE FOR THESE -- YOUTH AND INDIVIDUALS TO GO. TO SO IT IT'S KIND OF A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD HERE WE WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IT WE WANT TO ENJOY. BUT WE'VE WE'VE GOT. PROBLEMS OR ISSUES HERE TO ADDRESS SO HOW DO YOU SEE AS FACING THAT ISSUE WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND THEIR IMPACT THAT THIS MAY STIMULATE. I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PART I THINK THAT OUR PARKS HAVE BEEN IGNORED FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- INCLUDING OUR STATE BEACHES I'VE BEEN TO SOME STATE BEACH OF THAT CLEARLY NEED -- SOME HELP AND I AND I WORRY ABOUT. YOU KNOW -- I WENT TO ONE STATE BEACH THE WHERE THE STEPS GOING DOWN WERE CRACKED MADE A CEMENT IN THE RAILING WHICH WAS -- MADE OF IRON CLEARLY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED SO I WORRY ABOUT THAT TOO WHAT I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THE STATE BEACHES ARE HAVE BECOME A LITTLE ELITE. IN TERMS OF WHO GETS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEM. SO I BELIEVE THAT IF WE CREATE A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS. AGAIN RULE IN URBAN COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE COMMUNITY SUPPORT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE MORE SUPPORT FROM CALIFORNIANS TO SAY WE NEED TO DO. SOMETHING TO ENSURE THAT THE SPACES THAT WE HAVE ALLOCATED FOR CALIFORNIANS TO ENJOY. ARE AT THE LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE THAT THEY THEY SHOULD BE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] DR. YEAH MY QUESTION ALSO ALLIANCE A SIMILAR -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF BIGELOW IS A CONCERN -- IN THE NIGHT. I HEARD DOT MANY TIMES SO WE NEED. MORE A MAINTENANCE AND THE AMENITIES -- TO BE -- IS THAT BRIDGE THE SO. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF -- PROP SIXTY EIGHT DELLA WAS SO ORIGINALLY INTENDED THE OF FOR THIS OF TRANSPORTATION. ARE. FOR YOU WITH THE OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE KNOWN ON WALL WAS A STAR OF THE OR THE PURPOSES. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WARM BUILDING MAINTENANCE. PROP SIXTY EIGHT WAS INTENDED FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT -- NEEDS HOWEVER THERE WAS ABOUT SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE ALLOCATED OR THAT. THE VOTER INTENT WAS TO ACTUALLY CREATE A PATHWAY TO ALLOW DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO HAVE ACCESS TO STATE RESOURCES SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE THERE WAS A SPECIFIC AMOUNT SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS UP. TO SET ASIDE THE SPECIFIED THE IN THAT THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT IS CORRECT AND SO WHAT WE WANNA DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL AND ITS INTENT AND PURPOSE ALIGNS. WITH THE VOTER INTENTION WELL HOW HOW MUCH IS A CREATED A THREE TO SELL PROP. SIXTY EIGHT THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT OF THEM. TWO SURE TO WANNA -- THANK YOU FOR LOOKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN TO WEIGH IN HERE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND FEDERAL NOT BEHALF LOOKING OR DOORS -- AND OTTOMAN WHEN TWO HATS SPECIFIC TO THE PROP SIXTY QUESTIONS THAT I DON'T HAVE BEEN RAISED BY A BY THE BY THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT -- WANNA SPECIFY TWO THINGS IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE LAST YEAR -- TALKED ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE IN PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT FORTY SIMILAR KINDS OF OF OF IDEAS -- BUT PHENOMENALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS OF THE TWO AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION WAS FOR THE STATE WHAT PART PROGRAM WHICH IS FULLY INTENDED TO DEVELOP PARKS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN COMMUNITIES -- WHEREAS I'M CONCEPTS LIKE THE ONE THAT ARE OUTLINED IN IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BILL ARE ABOUT TAKING FOLKS OUT FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES -- TO OUR NATURAL SPACES BEING ABLE TO VISIT THE MOUNTAINS BEING UP TO HIS THE DESERT'S THAT THE COAST -- AND THEN SECOND -- DO ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WE'VE BEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS ACTUALLY -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS WEIGHED IN TO SAY THAT BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN AROUND -- USING BOND DOLLARS FOR PROGRAM COST THEY THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT GONNA ALLOW PROGRAMS TO MOVE FORWARD -- USING THOSE FUNDS FROM FROM PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT THE EMPHASIS FROM FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE NEEDS TO BE ON CAPITAL OUTLAY. I'M SO AS A RESULT WHAT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS IT IS VERY MUCH IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE INTENT OF OF THE VOTERS WHEN THE IMPROVE PROP. SIXTY EIGHT BUT TAKING IT OUTSIDE OF JUST THAT ONE STATURE IN THE BOND LANGUAGE AND APPLYING IT TO THE ENTIRETY OF RESOURCES AGENCY -- WITH THE HOPE OF COURSE AS THIS MOVES ON TO APPROPRIATIONS THE THE CONTINUE DISCUSSION ABOUT POTENTIALLY IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL FUNDS SOURCES WHETHER THEY BE SPECIAL FUNDS ARE GENERAL FUND -- TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON ON ON ON THE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS THAT ARE THERE IN THE BILL -- SO IT HAPPY TO ANSWER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THANKS FOR BRING HERE I THOUGHT THAT I GOT AN ANSWER BUT YOU YOU YOU. IT DIDN'T QUITE CLEAR BY BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING SETTING THE STAGE NOW FOR WHAT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT. AND AND THE JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY MY WORRY IS. WE ARE NOT BUDGETING THE NINE HUNDRED TO A BILLION DOLLARS OF BACK FEEL FOR THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO CREATE NEW PROGRAMS THAT BECAUSE A DRAIN. AND MISS GRILL IS. TRYING TO DO A AN ADMIRABLE THING HERE AND AND THAT'S GET THE YOU GET THE PEOPLE INTO THE PARK. BUT IT CASA COMES AT A COST BECAUSE NOW THAT COST WILL BE ACTS AND IT'LL BE LESS MONEY COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO APPROPRIATIONS. THAT WILL REDUCE THE ABILITY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO FIND OR GET MORE MONEY. TO TO THE PARKS TO TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES AT THAT LOCAL LEVEL IF WE CONTINUE TO CREATE PROGRAMS THAT ARE COSTING WILL CONTINUE TO SEE A A DEGRADATION. OF THE SERVICES THAT WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I THINK IT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN FACED BY THIS COMMITTEE. SINCE THIS IS A POLICY THAT SETS THE STAGE FOR THE APPROPRIATION ACTION. I I WOULD LOVE HIM. I WOULD SUGGEST LOOKING AT AT AT THE SLIMMEST BIGELOW. AND THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A A A A DEMOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN WAYNE IN MY MIND FOR A BIT -- NOW AND THAT IS THE IDEA THAT SOMETIMES WE REDUCE TAXES ON BUSINESSES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT CREATES MORE ECONOMIC REVENUE. SELF IF WE CREATE PROGRAMS THAT BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO THESE PARKS WE ARE ALSO CREATING REVENUE IN TERMS OF THE PARKING THAT THEY PAY ANY ENTRANCES ANY FEES. BUT WE PASSED A LAW LAST YEAR THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS STATE PARKS TO NOW SELL MERCHANDISE TO HELP OFFSET THOSE COSTS WHICH WILL BE IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR. SO WE'VE BEEN STEADILY WORKING AT WAYS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT OUR OUR STATE PARKS AND RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY MAINTAINED. A IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT WE'RE HOPING THAT IF WE ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO THESE PLACES AND THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE THE BEAUTY OF CALIFORNIA. WE CAN CREATE A PRIORITY AS TO WHAT THIS IS. AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND I WOULD LOOK AT IT THE SAME WAY IF WE REDUCE. TAXES WE STIMULATE THE ECONOMY WHICH CREATES AN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A BILL WHICH IN TURN REVOLVES A CIRCLE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT GETTING FUNDING FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD EVEN PUT THE GAS OR HAVE THE VEHICLE. THERE'S A MECHANISM FOR CREATING A A A PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FOR THEM TO GET THERE LIKELY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY. PARKING ISSUES LIKELY THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH IF ANY MONEY TO SPEND FOR THOSE RESOURCE THOSE. FACILITIES INSIDE THE PARKS I I WOULD GRANT THAT THAT THAT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STE. YOUTH OR INDIVIDUALS TO GO TO THESE PARTS I'M WITH YOU ON THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT. THAT OCCUR BUT WHAT I REALLY MISTER CHAIR THINK IS MORE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS FROM A MORE HOLISTIC. STANDPOINT AGAIN WHAT COMES FIRST. THE CARD FOR THE HORSE WE JUST GOT TO FIGURE ALL THAT OUT I'M I'M WITH YOU LIKE 90% THE WAYS JUST ONE LITTLE ELEMENT HERE THAT'S AYE LOOKING. ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM A SUMMER PERSON. THANK YOU AND I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THIS ABOUT ECONOMICS BUT ABOUT JUSTICE AND THE REALITY IS WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A RURAL% COMMUNITY AREN'T IRVINE COMMUNITY WHETHER YOU'RE RICH OR POOR WE'RE ALL PAYING FOR THIS BOND. AND THE REALITY IS THAT THESE PARKS ARE BEING USED WITH OR WITHOUT THAT MAINTAINS BUT IT'S ONLY BEING USED BY FOUR TWO CAN AFFORD. TO GET THEMSELVES ARE THE WE ARE ALL PAYING FOR THESE PARTS THE RESPECTIVE A LETTER INCOME LOOKS LIKE AT THE IN THE DAY. AND AS A BY JUSTICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE PAYING FOR THESE PARTS AND COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE PARKS. AGAIN EVERY REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE WILL DO A LITTLE BIT OF MATH FOR YOU IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND SO YOU STILL HAVE THE BULK OF THE MONEY OVER 95% OF THE MONEY TO GO TOWARDS THINGS LIKE MAINTENANCE TO ENSURE THAT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE JUSTICE BECAUSE OTHERWISE. YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE USING THE PARK WHO PAID FOR IT BUT THE DOLLARS THAT THEY PUT IN PLEASANT DOLLARS AT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE PUT IN BUT ARE NOT ENJOYING THE PARK. AND SETS ABOUT ENSURING THAT IN THE PROCESS WE CAN MULTI TASK. AND MAYBE AS A WOMAN I JUST I'M GOOD AT MULTI TASKING -- AND WE COULD DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME IT'S A SMALL TINY INVESTMENT TO ENSURE WE HAVE JUSTICE IN THIS PROCESS. AND SO I APPRECIATE WHERE THIS BILL IS GOING I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVE BEEN SIGNED AND HAVING MY COMMUNITY PARTAKE IN THESE ACTIVITIES. NOT ONLY ARE WE PARK PART OF MY DISTRICT AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS IN THIS PLAN ALSO HELPS WITH THAT. BUT WE ARE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF AND WHAT WE LOVE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IDLE SPEECHES THOSE MOUNTAINS. ON INTO WE NEED TO GET US OUT THERE AND AT IN A DAY I DON'T HAVE A SINGLE MOUNTAIN AND EVEN THOUGH THAT HAVE A POSITIVE SLOPE OF ANY SORT OF MY DISTRICT -- AND I DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE A BEACH. AND SO I APPRECIATE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS I THINK IT'S A SMALL INVESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A JUST PROCESS AS ARE DOING THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS THAT IS SO BADLY NEEDED TO THAT WE ARE ALL FAITH. AND AT THOSE. FIVE THANK YOU. I THINK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU SEE NO. ONE I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AT NEW WE'VE DISCUSSED THE BOND -- THAT WAS -- AUTHORED BY SENATOR DE LEóN. AND FOUR FOUR BILLION FOUR POINT ONE BILLION I THINK WAS THE TOTAL THE BOND THAT THIS ISSUE THAT WAS PUT FORWARD CREATIVELY -- TO CREATE -- PROGRAMS FOR AXIS I THINK WAS BRILLIANT -- I'D LIKE FOR US TO MAY BE ALSO IN THE SHORT TERM ADDRESSED THE ISSUE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS PUTTING FORWARD TO MANY OF THE LOCAL GROUPS AND ORGANISATIONS MAYBE IT'S A LETTER THAT WE ALL CAN SIGN ON TO LETTING THEM KNOW THAT -- THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN OF COURSE THIS BILLS JUST ALIGNING YOU KNOW THAT EFFORT -- BUT I I LINE MY SELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE -- CRISTINA GARCIA AND PROUD -- TO A CA TO THE BILL LIGHT A WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY OUR COLLEAGUE OF MR BIGELOW -- BUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY HERE NOT ENOUGH -- TO DO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND I I TO THE BELIEVE LIKE I THINK THAT. THE A DEMOCRAT WITH THE ENTREPRENEURIAL PERSPECTIVE -- MISS CARILLO THAT YEAH WE KNOW WHAT WE INVEST MONEY THERE. THAT IT WILL BREED MORE MONEY RIGHT MORE VISITORS TO THE PARK PEOPLE WILL SPEND MONEY. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALSO CREATE THE GREATER ADVOCATES -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CYCLE OF INVESTING IN TO OUR BEACHES ARE MOUNTAINS YOU KNOW A CONTINUES TO BE. A HIGH PRIORITY SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING. THIS BILL FORWARD -- DO WE HAVE A MOTION -- A MOTION AND A SECOND AT THE CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD JUST SAY THIS I I GREW UP IN THE IN THE BOYLE HEIGHTS EAST LA COMMUNITY -- CLOSE TO THE BEACH ABOUT AN HOUR. OR TWO DAYS DEPENDING ON TRAFFIC -- BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I WOULD TAKE A I WOULD TAKE A SCHOOL BUS THAT THE LA COUNTY SUPERVISORS WOULD PROVIDE OUT OF A LOCAL PARK COST A DOLLAR MY SISTER AND I AND WE WOULD TAKE I WAS LIKE A SATURDAY MORNING COSTS A DOLLAR. WE JUMP ON THE BUS GO TO THE BEACH ENJOY A DAY AT THE BEACH AND THEN COME BACK. ON MY PARENTS WORKED TWO JOBS THEY COULDN'T REALLY TAKE US ON A WEEKEND. BUT IT INSTILLED IN ME AND MY SISTERS THIS LOVE OF NATURE AND THIS LOVE OF THE BEACH AND THAT. WE PARTICIPATED N. BEACH CLEANUPS WE PARTICIPATED IN THEM AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT ACTUALLY -- MOTIVATED US TO LEARN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND I HOPE THAT THAT IS WHAT WE CREATE HERE. THAT WE GET YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SPACES TO LOVE OPEN SPACE TO LOVE NATURE TO LOVE THE ENVIRONMENT. AND TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF CALIFORNIA AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. BUT WE THINK YOU WILL MOTIONS SECOND EYES WERE ROQUE. THE MOTION IS TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS EDUARDO GARCIA. GARCIA I GALLAGHER [inaudible] BIGELOW.

ALONG WITH THE MANAGER TO SEE IF I'M WHICH SHOWS UP OTHERWISE ALL. PRESENT YEAH IT IS NOT [inaudible] WHICH MR GARCIA MISTER CHAIRMAN A. B. FOUR FOUR EIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE. TO IT WILL BEGIN BY PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR FORTY EIGHT THAT WILL ALLOW OWNERS OF STOCK PONDS WITH THE CAPACITY OF NO MORE THAN. TEN ACRE FEET TO PAY A ONE TIME FEE TO OBTAIN A VALID WATER RIGHT IN THE FORM OF A CERTIFICATE. THE CERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEE WILL ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE IMPROVE THE EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OF THE WATER SAVE IMPORTANT HABITAT. IN RURAL FARMLAND AT THE TWO WITNESSES A WITH ME THAT WILL TESTIFY. VERY BRIEFLY ON ON THIS MATTER. WE HAVE A MOTION BY. THIS GARCIA A SECOND BY THE CHAIR. ALRIGHT THANK YOU THE FIRST WITNESS. PLEASE. THANK YOU JACK RICE A RANCHER FROM HUMBLE COUNTY AND A MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S. THE GOAL HERE IS TO LOOK AT THE EXISTING SYSTEM FOR REGISTERING STOCK PONDS AND FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE IT MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. AND THAT'S WHAT A. B. -- FOR FORTY EIGHT DOES THESE ARE STOCK FUNDS ARE SMALL IMPOUNDMENTS THERE'S A LITTLE DAMP FEW FEET HIGH SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE EIGHTEEN MILLION ACRES OF RANGELAND IN CALIFORNIA. THEY CATCH WATER IN THE WINTER AND HOLD IT OVER TO THE DRY SEASON WHICH IS PROVIDES IMPORTANT. AGRA NAMIK BENEFITS KEEPS CATTLE OUT IN THE AREA IN THE LANDSCAPE SO THEY CAN BETTER UTILIZE FEED AND IT ALSO PROVIDES SOME IMPORTANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS IT'S WATER TO DRINK FOR ALL KINDS OF CRITTERS DURING THE DRY SEASON AS WE KNOW WATERS. THE LIFE -- LIFEBLOOD PARTICULARLY IN IN THE DRY SEASON WHICH IS A LITTLE HARD TO IMAGINE I GUESS RIGHT NOW BUT IT WILL COME BACK AGAIN. AND IT'S ALSO HABITAT FOR SOME IMPORTANT AMPHIBIANS. IN ADDITION -- FIRE SUPPRESSION IS THE KEY. OF VALUE TO THIS ARE OFTEN UTILIZED IN WILDFIRES BY HELICOPTERS PARTICULARLY. AND ALSO IT -- IT'S ANOTHER WAY TO SLOW WATER ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE WHICH IS IMPORTANT. FOR CALIFORNIANS WERE WORKING ON OUR GROUNDWATER SYSTEMS AND IN MY OPINION THIS IS ONE OF THOSE INSTANCES WHERE A RESOURCE IS GOOD FOR AGRICULTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM ISN'T WORKABLE. IT'S UNNECESSARILY EXPENSIVE AND BURDENSOME FOR LANDOWNERS AND FOR THE STATE. BASICALLY THE COST BENEFIT RATIO IS OUT OF WHACK IF YOU WILL. THIS STATE SPENDS TOO MUCH TIME AND MONEY DOING WHAT THE REGISTRATIONS IN THE LAND OWNERS DO THE SAME TO THE POINT WHERE -- IT MIGHT IN SOME CASES IT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE FOR THEM TO JUST TEAR AMOUNT. SO AB FOR FORTY EIGHT SEEKS TO BETTER ALIGN THE COSTS AND BENEFITS FOR BOTH FOR THE STATE AND FOR THE LANDOWNER. IT'S GONNA ADDRESS WITH INITIAL FILING FEE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO RENEW IT ALL THE TIME AND ALSO IT'LL SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS SOME. WE ARE TALKING [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THE THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS -- DOES THE OTHER -- PRESENTER ONE SAY ANYTHING DO ANYTHING MISTER OVER. WITH I JUST AN OLD FIELD WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION WERE SPONSORING THE BILL JUST WANNA TAKE THAT THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT ANY ISSUES.

ANYONE IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING CAM DELFINO WHAT -- WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE -- I WILL OFFER GETTING UP HERE BECAUSE ONE OF OUR REPORTS IS ACTUALLY CITED IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND THAT IS WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF STOCK PONDS FOR WILDLIFE AND IN FACT. WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE RANGE WITH THE RANCHING COMMUNITY -- AS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA RANGE LAND CONSERVATION COALITION. AND SO THAT SO. I THINK WHAT ARE OPPOSITION THOUGH IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE BILL IS PRESENTLY WRITTEN IS A BIT SWEEPING -- CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COST AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED HOWEVER WHEN THE BILL WAS PUT TOGETHER IT ALSO. EXEMPTED ALL REVIEW -- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE BOARD IN TERMS OF AND THE ABILITY. TO MONITOR TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPLIANCE IS IN ORDER AND SO WELL WE'RE NOT ADVOCATING FOR BURDENSOME PROCESS WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE AT LEAST SOME MINIMAL AMOUNT OF REVIEW. BECAUSE WHILE STOCK PLANS DO PROVIDE A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT OF FOR READ LIKE A FROG IN CALIFORNIA TIGER SALAMANDER THEY ARE SOMETIMES PRODUCE THROUGH DIVERSIONS -- AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE F. W. SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE DIVERSIONS AT LEAST -- TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT IMPACTING STREAMS -- THAT HAVE IMPORTANT FISH POPULATIONS SO WITH THAT BEING SAID WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL WITH THE WATER UGH THE CALIFORNIA WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD BUT HAD TO GET UP AND EXPRESS HER POSITION AT THIS POINT THANK YOU.

ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE I WILL BRING IT BACK IN ITS AS ALWAYS NICE WHEN I CAN SUPPORT ONE OF YOUR BILL SO. REMEMBER FRIEDMAN I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL -- SUPPORT IT LAST YEAR AS WELL -- YOU KNOW OF THE OF WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL STATE AND SO MANY ASPECTS OF IT AND WE NEED TO GET. ONE OF PROMOTE THOSE LOCATIONS GET MORE PEOPLE OUT RECREATION. APPRECIATE IN OUR RURAL AND SCENIC PARTS OF THE STATE. THAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST STILL HAVEN'T HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE AN AND SO I THINK CREATING THIS. THIS OFFICE WILL DO A LOT. TO TO HELP FOR THAT AND FOR ALL THE REASONS IT WAS STATED BEFORE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE YES DOCTOR CHOI. I EVEN THOUGHT THE CONCEPT IS SO GREAT AND OF PROMOTING OUR OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES ABOUT -- I'D JUST OWN WONDER. IF WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND OF PARTICIPATE IN THESE. OUTDOOR RECREATION IN ALL WE ALREADY -- MOM A WHILE AGO VOTED ON THE PROVIDING -- OUTDOOR TRANSPORTATION IN A SERVICES OF FOR DISADVANTAGED THE COMMUNITIES ETCETERA SO THIS IS SAID TO ME I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THIS ORDER REQUIRE EDITION ARE. A MONEY CREATING AND EITHER A BUREAUCRACY. I MEAN DO WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE TO WHAT THEN ENJOY E. ELLO THROUGH THIS OFFICE. PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW IF THEY CHOOSE TO GO OUT AND ENJOY. AND THE WHOLE -- DISORDER Là TURNED OUT TO BE IN ALL COST EFFECTIVE -- AND JUST OF BLOATING DOUBLE MONTH EXPANSION INTO WE AGREED TO THAT ASPECT. IS THAT A QUESTION YEAH NO I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS -- LOADING GOVERNMENT -- AGENCY I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE I I BELIEVE THAT INVESTING MONEY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS MONEY WELL SPENT. AND THERE'S A LACK OF COORDINATION RIGHT NOW BETWEEN A LOT OF THESE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES. AND HAVING THEM ALL AT ONE TABLE A WAY THAT THEY CAN PRIORITIZE AND MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER MONEY IS SPENT IS BEING SPENT. IN -- AREAS THAT THEY ALL AGREE SHOULD BE PRIORITY AREAS AND REALLY FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS -- IS IMPORTANT WE DO THIS WITH MANY AREAS WE DO THIS WITH -- UP WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT WE DON'T AREN'T DOING IT WITH THIS MAJOR INDUSTRY STATEWIDE. SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW DIVERTING SOME YOU KNOW SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY HERE WOULD PAY DIVIDENDS BACK AS WE BETTER COORDINATE FOCUS OUR PRIORITIES AND REALLY GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT MANY OF THE AREAS OF THE STATE IS MISTER GALLAGHER SAID. REALLY HAVE BEEN IGNORED YEAH WE DON'T NEED TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE SANTA MONICA BEACH PERHAPS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PARTS OF I'M SURE MR GALLAGHER'S DISTRICT. THAT MY CONSTITUENTS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SO GETTING THE WORD OUT AND AND YOU KNOW COULD REALLY HELP A LOT OF THOSE -- AREAS OF THE STATE THAT THAT ARE ARE LESS WELL KNOWN. ANOTHER AREA THAT I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THE ONCE WE CREATE THE SUCH OF BUREAUCRACY -- THIS OFFICE MAY -- EXERCISE SO ON TO POWER. AND THE LIMIT THE LAND USE. OF OVERALL. I EVEN LIMITING -- THE KARENNA BUSINESS THE INDUSTRY PRACTICES SO. SO UP IN A FOR THE REGULATIONS. RATHER THAN -- PROMOTING. AND A LITTLE BIT THE LEGISLATION IS AGENT OKAY CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE ANY OUR REGULATORY AUTHORITY BUT ALL THAT MONEY. THANK YOU TRACY RIGHT ATORES ON BEHALF THE OUTER INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AS INSTRUMENTS SAID THERE ARE ELEVEN I ACTUALLY LAST WEEK NEW MEXICO PASSED TO DO OFFICE ABOUT THE REPARATIONS THERE ARE TWELVE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE OFFICES LIKE THIS. NONE OF THEM HAVE LAND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE WAY THAT OUR CURRENCY STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT OR FISH AND WILDLIFE FRIEDMAN CONSERVANCY'S WOULD HAVE. THESE ARE ALL AS MISS FRIEDMAN MENTIONED REALLY COORDINATING AND FACILITATING OFFICES AND IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAPPEN IN PRIOR YEARS OF THIS OFFICE THAT THE VISION WAS REALLY ABOUT A TWO PERSON OFFICE. THAT IS REALLY LOOKING AS MISS BERMAN SAID ACROSS GOVERNMENT AND THAT INCLUDES FEDERAL AGENCIES LOCAL STATE AND REGIONAL AGENCIES THAT OUR LAND MANAGERS BUT ALSO AS THE WITNESSES SAID. LOOKING AT THE BUSINESSES COMPANIES BRANDS AND RECREATION PROVIDERS AND BRINGING THEM ALL TO THE TABLE BUT THEY THAT THIS OFFICE IS NOT INTENDED. TO EITHER RUN PROGRAMS IN PARKS OR TO MANAGE LANDS. OKAY THANKS A NUMBER DOLLY. THE RINGS BEFORE I JUST LIKE. TO SAY THAT TOM. I'M I'M HUGE SUPPORTER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS WELL -- I REPRESENT TO ALONG WITH THE SAME MEMBER GALLAGHER VAST. LANDSCAPES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE. UNDER UTILIZED AND I BELIEVE THIS -- AND I'M NOT I'M ONE THAT'S CRITICAL ALSO OF GETTING TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT BUT AS I LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND I SEE ALL THE FAIR POSTERS IN THIS ROOM RIGHT. AND WE MADE AN ARGUMENT A COUPLE YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW MUCH THE FAIRS ACTUALLY PRODUCE. VERSES THE MOUNT WE PUT IN AND THE TAX BASE THAT COMES BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES THE T. O. T. THAT'LL COME BACK FROM THIS -- I THINK WE'LL OVERWHELMINGLY. INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE COMING IN FROM PEOPLE FROM OUT OF STATE -- AND ACROSS THE WORLD ACTUALLY -- TO COME TO OUR STATE AND I THINK THIS IS A APPROPRIATELY -- DID.

BLANCA RUBIO AYE SALAS. SALAS I WOULD. WOULD I IT'S TAKING. WE'LL LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR ANOTHER MEMBER -- TO ADD ON WE HAVE UP I DON'T FIVE A. B.. FOUR FIFTY FOUR BY MISTER KALRA RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- I'M HAPPY -- TO TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY BILL. FOUR FIVE FOUR WHICH JUROR WHICH ADDRESS THE DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE AND CALIFORNIA'S WILDLIFE PROTECTION LAW. AS YOU SEE WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OF GREAT IMPORTANCE CLEAN WATER CLEAN AIR ENDANGERED SPECIES OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. ATTEMPTS TO DISMANTLE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND STANDARDS HAS PUT CALIFORNIA AND THE CHALLENGING POSITION OF BEING TO SECURE PROTECTION FOR NATURAL TREASURES. MIGRATORY BIRDS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZING CALIFORNIA LAW AND IN OUR COURTS AS AN IMPORTANT NATURAL RESOURCE WITH INTRINSIC VALUE FOR THE STATE'S NATURAL HISTORY THAT ALSO PROVIDES. SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL ECONOMIC AND RECREATIONAL BENEFITS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITIES MANY MIGRATORY BIRD POPULATIONS OF DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE HISTORIC NUMBERS IN THE STATE MUST BE ABLE TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGE AND PROTECT THEM TO ENSURE THEIR NUMBERS ARE NOT NEEDLESSLY DECLINED FURTHER. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN PATIENT GO KICK GAME CODE SECTION THREE FIVE ONE THREE PROHIBITS THE KILLING OF MIGRATORY BIRDS UNLESS ALLOWED BY THE RULES OR REGULATIONS ISSUED FROM THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR. PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT WITH THE MBTA. THE MBTA IS ONE OF THE NATION'S OLDEST ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND FOR DECADES IT HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROHIBIT SO CALLED INCIDENTAL TAKE OR THE UNINTENTIONAL BUT PERCEIVABLE KILLING OF MIGRATORY BIRDS. DURING OTHERWISE LEGAL ACTIVITIES. THE MBTA IS CREDITED WITH HELPING CONSERVE. HUNDREDS OF BIRD SPECIES INCLUDING SUCH NOTABLE SPECIES AS THE SAND HILL CRANES. RED TAILED HAWK AND BURROWING OWL WHICH ARE NOT PROTECTED BY OTHER FEDERAL STATUTE. THE PROVIDES THE BASIS RECOVERING NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES FROM EVENTS LIKE THE EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL IN ALASKA AND THE COSCO BUSAN SPILL ON THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. IT ALSO INCENTIVIZE INDUSTRIES WAS ACTIVITIES GOAL BIRDS TO DEVELOP METHODS TO AVOID AND MINIMIZE THEIR IMPACTS. THE BITE THIS DESPITE THE SUCCESSES OF THE MBTA MOST MIGRATORY BIRD SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA IN DECLINE LARGELY DUE TO A LOT LOSS OF HABITAT AND DIRECT IMPACTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY. THE NORTH AMERICA AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY TWO BIRD SPECIES MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF BIRDS THAT OCCUR ON THE CONTINENT ARE AT HIGH RISK OF EXTINCTION WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CONSERVATION ACTION. HOWEVER DESPITE THESE BOX IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS FOR A LEGAL OPINION THAT REVERSED. DECADES OF BIPARTISAN GOVERNMENT POLICY AND PRACTICE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AND FOR SOME OF THE MBTA. IN PARTICULAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID IT WOULD NO LONGER CONSIDER THE MBTA TO PROHIBIT INCIDENTAL TAKE. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION INTERPRETATION WOULD MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO LIABILITY FOR CALLING BIRDS UNDER THE MBTA FROM MASSIVE EVENTS LIKE THE EXXON VALDEZ OR DEEP WATER HORIZON OIL SPILLS. IT ALSO OPENS THE DOOR FOR INDUSTRIES LIKE MINING AND OIL DRILLING TO KILL MIGRATORY BIRDS WITHOUT AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID A MEDICAID. SUCH IMPACTS. AS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION GROWS INDUSTRIES CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE CLIMATE CHANGES AND RESOURCES BECOME SCARCER. AS FEDERAL ROLL BACK TO THE MBTA IT CREATED A VACUUM AND WILDLIFE PROTECTION CERTAINTY IS NEEDED FOR BOTH CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND INDUSTRY. TO ENSURE THAT BIRDS AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES ARE PROTECTED. THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IT'S REAL LEGAL ADVISORY LAST NOVEMBER IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REAFFIRMING CALIFORNIA STATE LAW PROTECTION FOR BIRDS AS STATING THAT STATE LAW PROHIBITS INCIDENTAL TAKE. ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR FIVE FOUR SIMPLY MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA RETAINS AUTHORITY TO MAKE ITS OWN RULES REGARDING MIGRATORY BIRD PROTECTIONS. IT WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA MANAGES CONSTITUTIONAL PUBLIC TRUST IS POSSIBILITY TO PROTECT BIRDS AND HABITAT. AND WILL NOT UNNECESSARILY DEFERRED THEM TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. BEFORE I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS I FEEL THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION FROM GROUPS REPRESENTING AGRICULTURE TIMBER HARVEST WIND AND SOLAR PRODUCERS. THESE ARE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE THRIVED FOR DECADES UNDER THE LONGSTANDING INTERPRETATION THAT THE MBTA PROHIBITS AND THEN I'LL TAKE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE NONE OF BEEN PROSECUTED FOR INCIDENT INCIDENTAL TAKE UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW. IT IS SIMPLY NOT CREDIBLE FOR OPPOSITION TO CLAIM THAT MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO FOR BIRD PROTECTIONS IN THE STATE. AS IT HAS BEEN FOR AT LEAST FOUR DECADES WILL HARM THEIR INDUSTRIES PREVENT CALIFORNIA FROM REACHING IMPORTANT ECONOMIC A RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS. IT WASN'T LONG AGO THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CYNICALLY ATTACK THE WIND ENERGY PRODUCERS BIRD KILLERS AT THAT AN ENERGY PLAN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT MADE NEWS ON IT WAS IGNITING BIRDS. ON FIRE IN MIDAIR IN THESE CASES AND MANY OTHERS THESE INDUSTRIES AND THEIR DEFENDERS NOTED THAT GREAT EFFORTS. OF THE GREAT APRS THEY WERE MAKING TO REDUCE AND MITIGATE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS FROM THE RAPID EXPANSION THERE INCENTIVIZE TO DO SO BY THE PROTECTIONS FOR MIGRATORY BIRDS. THAT PREVENT INCIDENTAL TAKE AND THEIR ACTIONS AS AN OPERATIONS WERE BUBBLE REVERB -- COMPLIANCE WITH THE MBTA RULES AND REGULATIONS. YET NOW THESE GROUPS JOIN WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND APPLIED AS ADMINISTRATION WERE ROLLING BACK ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS DONE BETTER AND WE SHOULD NOT LET THESE INDUSTRIES UNDERMINE OUR STATE'S AUTHORITY RESPONSIBILITY PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS PARTICULARLY SINCE WE'RE JUST GOING BACK TO THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN OPERATING. FOR DECADES UP UNTIL LAST YEAR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR FIVE FOUR I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE -- AND AT THIS TIME BUT ASK MIKE LINES MODEL ON CALIFORNIA PERS. TO MAKE MY SAYS OF EXCELLENCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MY NAME IS MIKE LINES ON THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR AUTO IN CALIFORNIA I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS WORK ON THIS BILL AND STANDING UP FOR MIGRATORY BIRDS. AND ECHO HIS COMMENTS AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF BASE TO THE STATE TO PROVIDE BILLIONS IN INCOME AND ECOLOGICAL ECOLOGICAL VALUE IN RECREATIONAL VALUE. AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT DECLINE FOR DECADES. ON ONE SUPPORTS A BEFORE FIVE FOUR BECAUSE IT'S NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT BIRDS AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE STATE. FOR MANY MANY DECADES WITHOUT BEING UNDERMINED BY THE EROSION OF FEDERAL BIRD PROTECTIONS BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. IF THE ADMINISTRATION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL OUR SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRY WILL BE ALLOWED TO KILL MIGRATORY BIRDS WITH IMPUNITY EVEN EVENTS AS MENTIONED LIKE MAJOR OIL SPILLS OVER INDUSTRY IS GROSSLY NEGLIGENT. IN FAILING TO ADDRESS SOURCES OF KNOWN -- MORTALITY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MENTIONED THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ATTORNEY GENERAL -- LEGAL ADVISORY. I'M SORRY. 200-020-0018. LEGAL ADVISORY FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE AND I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE MAJOR POINTS. ONE IT MADE CLEAR THAT WITHIN THE STATE'S CONSTITUTION AND THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS CHARGED WITH OWNERSHIP AND MANAGING THE BIRDS FOR THE PUBLIC TRUST. IT ALSO MADE CLEAR THE CALIFORNIA LAW HAS ALWAYS APPLIED INCIDENTAL TAKE WITHIN THE FISHING GAME CODE. AGAIN THIS IS BEEN THE WAY IT HAS BEEN FOR YEARS I KNOW THAT NONE OF THE OPPOSITION LETTERS. EVEN REFER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL ADVISORY. BOARD ADDRESS ANY OF THE COURT CASES THAT ARE CITED THEREIN. AB FOUR FIVE FOUR IS INTENDED TO FIX A PROBLEM IN THE FISHING GAME CODE SECTION THIRTY FIVE THIRTEEN WHICH ALLOWS TAKE WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE PROMULGATED FROM DEPARTMENT INTERIOR. THIRTY FIVE THIRTEEN WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY BOTH PARTIES. THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE MBTA APPLIED INSTILL TAKE IT WAS THERE TO SWEEP IN SOME EXEMPTIONS OF THE PART OF IN CHERRY HEARD IT HAD ISSUED. AROUND -- SO TAKE THAT MAY OCCUR FOR SCIENTIFIC A VETERINARY PURPOSES OR PROTECT PROPS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THEY WERE VERY NARROW EXEMPTIONS AT THIRTY FIVE THIRTEEN WAS TRYING TO SWEEP INTO STATE LAW. THIRTY FIVE THIRTEEN WAS NEVER INTENDED TO PROVIDE A BROAD EXEMPTION INCIDENTAL TAKE WHICH IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GOES FORWARD AS IT SAYS IT. WILL. TO IMPLEMENT A NEW REGULATION UNDER THE MBTA THAT ALLOWS INCIDENTAL TAKE. THE LAST POINT ON THAT IS -- SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA FISHING GAME CODE TO PROHIBIT THE TAKE OF NATIVE BIRDS MIGRATORY BIRDS. BUT SAY THAT IS NOT IT IS ALLOWED IF IT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE CODE. SO THE LOOPHOLE IN THIRTY FIVE THIRTEEN TO CREATE PROBLEMS AND THIRTY FIVE OR THREE THIRTY FIVE A THREE POINT FIVE AND THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED WHICH ALL PROVIDE PREVENT PROTECTIONS. THE BILL [inaudible] I GOT [inaudible] OR YOU KNOW WHAT IS THAT SOME OF FINISHED [inaudible] CHECK THEM. SO THE LOT AT LAST REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AS WITH A CALIFORNIA WILL SELF DETERMINE IN MAKE UP ITS OWN MIND BUT HOW WILL MANAGE MIGRATORY BIRDS WITHIN ITS BORDERS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GET OUT A GOOD MORNING CAM DELFINO WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE -- I'M ALL MAKE THIS PRETTY BRIEF BECAUSE I THINK THAT -- AND THE ISSUES OF ALREADY BEEN COVERED WHAT I'LL JUST SAY IS THAT. THE OPPOSITION WILL GET UP HERE TODAY AND THEY'LL TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE CONCERNS OVER THE CHANGES BEING TO LOBBYING PROPOSED BY THIS BILL BUT I THINK THAT THE THE POINT IS BEEN WELL MADE THAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE BILL IS HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF A UNILATERAL. CHANGE THAT WAS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR SOLICITOR WHO OUT OF THE BLUE ISSUED AN OPINION REVERSING DECADES OF LAW. THAT SAID THAT THAT THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT A LOT OF DID NOT ALLOW INCIDENTAL TAKE OF MIGRATORY BIRDS. SO WITH THIS CHANGE IT'S ACTUALLY CREATED A HUGE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH IN CALIFORNIA LAW AND ALL THIS BILL DOES IS TRY TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY AGAIN. WHICH IS GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN BEFORE THIS UNILATERAL CHANGE AND FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THIS BILL. IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE IT WILL NOT CREATE UNCERTAINTY IN FACT WILL CREATE MORE CERTAINTY AND IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S MIGRATORY BIRDS AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE.

YOU GET THE MORE DIVERSE REPRESENTATION THERE. WILL LAST THE THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION TO BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I THINK THAT THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT OVER WHAT STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ARE AT VARIOUS POINTS IN TIME. AND I THINK THAT BOTH SIDES ON THIS ISSUE THINK THAT THEY'RE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY -- I THINK THE AUDUBON HAS EXPRESSED THAT THE MOST THE RECENT DECISION AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL CONTRADICTS DECADES OF FEDERAL POLICY BECAUSE IT REFERS REVERSED A LONGSTANDING INTERPRETATION OF THE MBTA. HOWEVER -- THIS INTERPRETATION WAS ONLY FORMALIZED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THE YEAR BEFORE THE TRUMP -- DECISION CAME OUT. I BELIEVE THAT OUR INDUSTRIES BELIEVE THAT. WE ALSO STAND ON GOOD FOOTING BECAUSE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE US COURT OF APPEALS IN THE FIFTH CIRCUIT HELD. THAT THE MBTA PROTECTION PROVISION DOES NOT INCLUDE THAT IN UNINTENTIONAL TAKE. SORRY THE UNINTENTIONAL TAKE A MIGRATORY BIRDS AND PRIOR TO THE SIT GO DECISION THE US COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT. AND THE US COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT SIMILARLY HELD THAT THE MBTA APPLIED ONLY TO THE INTENTIONAL TAKE OR CAPTURE MIGRATORY BIRDS. SUCH AS HUNTING OR TRAPPING. UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MBTA WAS INTERPRETED APPLY ONLY TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONS THAT HAVE AS THEIR PURPOSE THE TAKE OR KILLING A MIGRATORY BIRDS. I DON'T THINK THAT THIS INTERPRETATION IS AS BAD AS THE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT THAT WITH THE FAQS THAT SUBSEQUENTLY FOLLOWED AS A RESULT OF THAT -- AND IN THAT GUIDANCE DOCUMENT I THINK THERE WAS A SHE WON A PORTION THAT SAID IS REMOVING A STRUCTURE FOR EXAMPLE A DILAPIDATED BARN KNOWN. WITH NO NESTING. FOR SORRY NO NESTING OWLS IN THE BARN WHICH WILL DIE IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OF THE BURN A VIOLATION MBTA ANSWERED THIS WOULD NOT BE A VIOLATION OF THE MBTA. REMOVING OR DESTROYING THE STRUCTURE WOULD RARELY IF EVER BE THE ACT THAT HAS THE FEELING I'LL NESTLINGS AS ITS PURPOSE WE DON'T JUST WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. FAQ THAT CAME OUT ON THAT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT MANY ORGANIZATIONS WOULD STAND HERE SAYING THAT THEY'VE WHOLEHEARTEDLY APPROVE. OF WHAT THE FAQ WAS -- I THINK THAT THE AUDUBON HAS ALSO MENTION INCIDENT THAT THEY DON'T THINK THE MBTA WOULDN'T ALONG WITH NO LONGER APPLY TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. SUCH AS THE DEEPWATER HORIZON WHERE AN OIL SPILL. DESTROYED OR INJURED UP TO A MILLION BIRDS SINCE INTENT WAS NOT ORIGINALLY TO KILL THE BIRDS -- I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT -- IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE MINISTRY OF ACTION HOWEVER I WILL SAY THAT IN THE PAST ESPECIALLY LAST YEAR WITH THE INTRODUCTION -- TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN IN ONE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IT SAID THAT THE TOP HUMAN RELATED THREATS TO BIRDS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE AS FOLLOWS. CATS WHICH KILL AN ESTIMATED TWO POINT FOUR BILLION BILLION BIRDS PER YEAR COLLISIONS WITH BUILDING GLASS WHICH KILL AN ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED AND THREE POINT FIVE MILLION BIRDS PER YEAR. COLLISIONS WITH VEHICLES WHICH CON ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED MILLION BIRDS PER YEAR POISONS WHICH KILL AN ESTIMATED SEVENTEEN SHOOT SEVENTY TWO MILLION PARTS PER YEAR. COLLISIONS WITH ELECTRICAL LINES WILL KILL AN ESTIMATED TWENTY FIVE MILLION BIRDS PER YEAR COLLISIONS WITH COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS. ELECTROCUTION OIL PITS COLLISIONS WITH WIND TURBINES. NOR ON THEIR ITS FORESTRY LISTED WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST STRICT FORCE PRACTICE RULES IN IN THE NATION IF NOT IN THE WORLD. WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO WE HAVE A GREAT CONCERN IN THIS BILL THAT -- AGRICULTURE HAS HAD A LONG STANDING DEFINITION WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE INCIDENTAL TAKE FOR ACTS THAT OCCUR ON A FARM OR RANCH DURING THE COURSE OF OTHERWISE LAWFUL ROUTINE AND ONGOING AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES. WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- IN ORDER FOR OUR OPPOSITION TO BE -- RELIEVED AT THIS POINT THAT FORESTRY BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE ON GOING AND AND ROUTINE ACTIVITIES OF AGRICULTURE FOR PURPOSES OF MBTA ONLY -- AND THAT'S OUR OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING NO -- KRAMER'S THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THE SIGNIFICANT HABITAT THAT CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE AND CALIFORNIA'S FORCE PROVIDE TO BIRDS AND MANY OTHER WILDLIFE SPECIES. AND IF IT IF NOT FOR THESE OPEN SPACES. WE WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE DEVELOPMENT AND WE WOULD HAVE A LOT LESS WILDLIFE HABITAT. BUT PROVIDING THAT HABITAT CREATES REGULATORY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR FORESTS. I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT THIS BILL IS SIMPLY MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO. IF YOU LOOK AT LINE TWELVE IT GIVES THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT A REGULATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH. OR MORE PROTECTIVE THAN RULES AND REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE US SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR UNDER THE FEDERAL ACT. THAT'S WHERE OUR CONCERN LIES. IS GIVING THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THE AUTHORITY TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. THE EXISTING AND FORMER INTERPRETATION OF THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT. SO WE HAVE TO SPECIFIC CONCERNS IN THAT AREA. FIRST THERE ARE LONG STANDING PROVISIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL ACT THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE WELL BEFORE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THAT ALLOWS FOR THE TAKE OF CERTAIN MIGRATORY BIRDS. THAT DAMAGE CROPS OR PREVENT A HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO ACCEPT THOSE LONG STANDING PROVISIONS. THE OTHER PIECE THAT'S NOT THAT IS CONCERNING AND MORE CONCERNING IN FACT IS JUST GIVING THE DEPARTMENT CARP WASH AUTHORITY. TO MOVE FORWARD AND ADOPT REGULATIONS THAT CAN GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. WHAT IS IN? THE CURRENT AND FORMER INTERPRETATION MIGHT DRAPER TREATY ACT SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT. GIVEN THE RISKS THAT WE HAVE BEEN HARVESTING CROPS OR MANAGING OUR FORESTS OR MANAGING THE LANDS THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR TAKE AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAY NOT ALLOW FOR THAT WHICH CREATES GREAT REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY FOR CONTINUING TO PRODUCE FOOD IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT WE OPPOSE THE BILL -- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE WORKED ON CLOSELY WITH THE SPONSORS LAST YEAR ON AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN AND THEY ACTUALLY DID ACCEPT. AMENDMENTS THAT RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES THAT AGRICULTURE AND CREATED AN EXEMPTION FOR AGRICULTURE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AND PROTECTION FOR FORESTRY AS WELL -- AND AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT CONVERSATION THANK. THANK YOU WERE GONNA ASK THOSE ONE TO STATE YOUR NAME RELATION OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION VERY BRIEFLY IF I MAY THE AUTHOR DID NOTE THAT OUR INDUSTRY. HAS NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN PROSECUTED UNDER THE ACT WE BELIEVE THAT CHANGES UNDER THIS BILL POTENTIALLY RETROACTIVELY WE ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF GUIDELINES BEST PRACTICE GUIDELINES FEDERALLY AS WELL AS SEQUEL HERE IN THE STATE. FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU NEXT FIRST. MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS DELANEY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION AND FOR MY COLLEAGUE SHANNON EDDIE AT THE LARGE SCALE SOLAR ASSOCIATION. WE REMAIN OPPOSED. VALERIE NEARBY THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE IN OPPOSITION. MARGOT PARKS MAP OF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION AND ONE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE CONCERN SHARED. WITH FARM BUREAU ABOUT THE THE DUPLICATION THINKING. BRIAN WHITE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE FORCES ASSOCIATION AND THE FORCE ANNALS OF CALIFORNIA WERE ALSO OPPOSE WITH THE AFFIRMATION STATED REASONS WERE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL COULD ON INTENSELY IMPACT GOVERNOR. BROWN'S AND GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS DEALING WITH FORCE MANAGEMENT AND THE PACE OF SKILL TO DEAL CATHOLIC WILDFIRES THANK. RIGHT THE NUMBER YOU BACK GOOD. LUCK TO ADDRESS ANY OF COMES A BIT MADE THEN WILL BRING AN OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THERE'S A LOT TO RESPOND IN FACT YOUR STAFF DID AN EXCELLENT JOB AND ACTUALLY -- IF IF MEMBERS OF THEIR STAFFS HAVE. HAD A CHANCE TO READ THE REPORT YOU'LL SEE FOR EXAMPLE A CURRENT LAW ALREADY ALLOWS THE FISHING GAME. BOOK THE COMMISSION TO ADOPT REGULATIONS THAT CONFORM WITH OR FURTHER RESTRICT THE RULES REGULATIONS PRESCRIBED PERCENT MBTA THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW WITH THIS BILL. IT'S JUST CODIFYING BUT LAW HAS BEEN AND HAS EXISTED IN OUR STATE AGAIN FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS -- FURTHER MORE -- THE A A THE FOR WHAT THIS DOES AND THE REASON WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. IS THAT. IN PAST YEARS. WE HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATELY DEFERRING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR IN ORDER TO CREATE. THE OF THE GUIDELINES OR RULES AS IT APPLIES A MIGRATORY BIRDS AND WE TALK ABOUT IS AN ALL TAKES NOT SAYING THAT NO BIRDS CAN DIE BUT BIRDS DIE ALL THE TIME AS YOU CAN SEE. DUE TO LEGAL. BUSINESS OPERATIONS IT'S JUST MAKING SURE THAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE PUT IN PLACE MEDICATION IS WHAT IS PUT IN PLACE TO REDUCE HARM AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. IT'S QUITE SIMPLE IT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR DECADES UP UNTIL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ROLLING BACK THE THE RULES AND THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW. PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN LINE WITH TRUMP IS COMPLETELY FALSE AS STATED IN THE REPORT IN JANUARY JANUARY TENTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. ACTUALLY AFFIRMED THE POSITION THAT THIS BILL TAKES -- THAT TO PROHIBITIONS CAN AND DO APPLY TO DIRECT INCIDENTAL TAKE. UP THIS OPINION WAS SUSPENDED I WITHIN A COUPLE WEEKS OF PRESENT JUMPING ELECTED AND IN DECEMBER WAS COMPLETELY. LEVEL OF THE L. ONE EIGHTY OCCURRED AND WITH THE RULES OF INCIDENTAL TAKE WHICH ARE NOW SOON GONNA BE PERMANENTLY CODIFIED BUT THE BOND INSPIRATION. WILL TAKE EFFECT SO -- WHAT PRESIDENT OF IT? BUT PRESERVATION MY THE WHAT WAS IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT REMAIN IN PLACE. THIS BILL WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE LONGSTANDING PRACTICE IS NOW BEING REVERSED UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- IN SO THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE I KNOW A LOT OF CONFUSION IS BEING PLACED HERE THIS IS NOT GONNA RESTRICT THE OPERATION OF ANY THE INDUSTRIES IN THE FACT. A BILL THAT THAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION HELP TO KILL LAST YEAR -- AB TWENTY TO TWENTY SEVEN WAS. WHAT WAS AMENDED TO ALLOW FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF BEST PRACTICES BY ALL THESE INDUSTRIES WHICH ALLOW THE INDUSTRIES OF THE COM PORT WITH BUT THEY -- DIEM AS BEST PRACTICES AND IT IS ALMOST A BALL THOSE BEST PRACTICES -- AND AND WE CAN CLARIFY THAT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND NOT WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS AND GIVES A MUCH MORE. ABILITY TO WORK WITH US AS A STATE TO PUT IN PLACE -- RULES THAT MAKES SENSE FOR OUR INDUSTRIES I LIKE I SAID FOR FOR DECK OVER FOUR DECADES AND AND YOU'LL SEE ALSO -- THAT SINCE. SEVENTEEN OF FORMER LEADERS THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR REPRESENTING WHITE HOUSE IS BACK TO THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE CO SIGNED A LETTER. OPPOSING THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTERPRETATION AND URGING SUPPORT FOR THE MBTA WE THIS BILL IS IN LINE WITH THOSE SEVENTEEN FORMER DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR LEADERS. IN SUPPORTING THE M. B. T. A.. THESE INDUSTRIES ARE NOW ARE RAISING CONCERNS HAVE BEEN DOING JUST FINE FOR THE PAST FOUR DECADES. THEY'VE BEEN PROTECTING THE BIRDS TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY THEY'VE BEEN PROSPERING WE'VE ENCOURAGE THEM TO PROSPER WHETHER BE SOLAR OR AG OR TIMBER -- BUT THESE RULES ARE IN PLACE TO SIMPLY SAY THAT WE DO HAVE A ROLE IN OR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS AS WE PROMOTE THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY BOTH CAN BE DONE AS THE STATE HAS SHOWN. FOR OVER FOUR DECADES AND THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW THIS BILL IS GOING UP ON WINE THAT IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT'S UNWINDING OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT. OUR ENVIRONMENT PROTECT OUR BIRDS AND WORK WITH OUR INDUSTRY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE. THANK YOU WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FROM DIS -- MISSILES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YEAH OUT THANK YOU -- MISTER KALRA FOR ADDRESSING THAT I KNOW THAT THE FORESTRY ASSOCIATION OF A WE COULD FOLLOW UP WITH FORESTRY ASSOCIATION OR MAYBE. MISTER CHAIR IF YOU WANT TO ALLOW THEM TO TALK ABOUT AT LEAST THIS POINT THAT WAS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS OF WHETHER THIS WAS FORMALIZED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OR NOT. THE MISTER KALRA RESPONDED BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS IT. SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DOORS. AND THEN CHANGING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE. A DISCREPANCY HERE. PAGE THREE OF THE OF THE ANALYSIS YOU'LL SEE -- THE DESCRIPTION THIS LISTER'S OPINIONS -- THIS. BOTTOM TWO PARAGRAPHS THANK I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY I AGREE WITH WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA SAYING WHAT I WHAT I WHAT I MEANT AND MAYBE IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT I SAID WAS. THE DECADES OF STANDING LAW THAT THAT AUDUBON THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR SAYING HAS BEEN IN PLACE WAS ONLY FORMALIZED. AS RECENTLY AS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THAT'S WHEN IT WAS FORMALIZED AFTER THAT THE TRUMP DECISION CAME I WASN'T TRYING TO SUGGEST THAT THANK YOU FOR THE KIND OF CRAZY WITH EACH OTHER I APOLOGIZE BUT MISUNDERSTOOD THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN AND YOU KNOW THANK YOU THE SCORE FOR RECOGNIZING YOU KNOW CAL FREQUENT ENERGY IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THEIR OPPOSITION -- IS IT YOUR ATTENTION THAT THEY ARE TO BE PROSECUTED UNDER THE ACT I MEAN IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE INTERPRETATION THAT THEY HAVE NOW. NO THEY'LL BUILD OPERATE THE SAME OF THE BEEN OPERATE OPERATING FOR DECADES -- AND AND THAT JUST MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT IN MEASURES TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTAL TAKES -- AND EXAMPLES AB AND AND BUT IN FACT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. THE BOAT OUR DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THEM ON AS OPPOSED TO RELYING ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR MORE INCLUSIVENESS IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS AS EASY AS THIS IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THEN MAYBE FOR AS LONG NOW MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING. TO CLARIFY YEAH YEAH THAT IS THIS THE AGAIN IF THEY HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED LOS FORTY YEARS OF THE RIGHT ABOUT IT NOW. OKAY AND THEN -- I DO WANNA GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK -- TO LISA FORCE LANDOWNERS OF CALIFORNIA THE LACES FORSTER'S ASSOCIATION WHERE THEY SEE THIS IS PROBABLY AN OPPOSITION TO GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S. ACTIONS I MEAN WOULD YOU LIKE. TO THINK THAT UP YOU KNOW THIS THIS I DON'T THAT ALL IN IT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACTIONS THAT I SUPPORT THAT OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE. THAT TO OUR FORESTRY INDUSTRY WORKS WITH OUR STATE AND TERMS A WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION AND OF ENSURING THAT OUR FORCIBLE MANAGE OTHERS NOTHING IN THIS THAT COUNTERS THAT IN FACT. I I BELIEVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION FROM NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS CONSISTENT AS WELL WITH THE GOVERNOR BROWN AS WELL AS GOVERNOR OF A NUISANCE POSITION. OKAY AND THEN YOU HAD MENTIONED YOUR PREVIOUS LEGISLATION AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN SO WHAT'S THE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. LAST YEAR'S BILL IN THIS YEAR'S BILL LESTER THEIR WORKING WITH US TO TRY TO MAKE IT ACTUALLY AMENABLE FOR INDUSTRY AND AND I THINK THAT WE HAD GREAT PROGRESS MADE -- THIS YEAR ALL OF A SUDDEN -- THE CLAIM IS THAT THIS -- BILL'S GOING TO SOMEHOW. MAKE IT. CHALLENGES FOR THEIR INDUSTRIES TO OPERATE AND IS JUST NOT TRUE GOT IT SO IT'S A REITERATION OF LAST YEAR'S BUT AGAIN THIS YEAR. YOU JUST TRY TO PUSH IT THROUGH THE PROCESS YEAH IT'S IS I THINK THAT. COMING INTO THIS YEAR UP AGAIN LOOK WE ARE WE STILL HAVE THE SAME OPEN DOOR -- TO WORK TO MAKE SURE LOOK AT THE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTINUED AND FOR SOME OF THE BAG OF BUBBLE WRAP MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE -- AND HAS BEEN WORKING JUST FINE FOR FOUR DECADES THAT WE JUST CONTINUE TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR DECADES WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO ENSURE. THAT INDUSTRY -- ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE IMPLEMENT THEIR BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. I HAD TO PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS AND I THINK BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE -- LAST YEAR IS THAT OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S COME FORWARD AND SUPPORTED OUR POSITION. OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND I STILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT YOU KNOW I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU THANK YOU BUT THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH. OBVIOUSLY WHEN SOLAR THE FORESTRY ASSOCIATION AND THEN I'M YOU KNOW I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH WILD FIRES. AND WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOME WILL GOVERNOR BROWN HAVE DONE -- SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS AND LOOK FOR TO HOPEFULLY MAYBE IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU IN A QUESTIONS THESE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN -- AND THANK YOU THIS CALL FOR A DISCUSSION AS WELL COMMITTEES ARE FOR TRAXXAS OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THERE CERTAINLY IS A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN. THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL -- HAS YOU SEE IT MEANT -- TO TO OPERATE AND I THINK THE CONCERNS ARE MOST -- CAPTURE MY ATTENTION THE SOLAR AND WIND INDUSTRY -- MANY OF US HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF EXTREME INCREASING THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. IF THIS IN PERIL THAT -- THAT WOULD BE CONCERNING TO OTHER BILLS ARE THE VOTES WE TAKE AND YOU DON'T SEE THESE IS BEING -- IN CONFLICT NOT AT ALL IN FACT MAY I REPRESENT A DISTRICT WITH CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY SON POWER IN A NUMBER OF OTHER SOLAR OF A MAJOR OF SOLAR MANUFACTURERS ARE BASED IN MY DISTRICT -- AND SO I I THERE'S NOTHING THAT I WOULD DO CERTAINLY TO HINDER -- WHAT I AGREE -- OR IMPORTANT GOALS IN TERMS RENEWABLE ENERGY AND AGAIN -- THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN GROWING DRAMATICALLY IN OUR STATE THANKS TO THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH THIS. RULE IN PLACE AND AND THAT'S NOT LOST ON ME -- AT THE SAME TIME OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A DISCREPANCY TO GET YOU CAN OFFER TODAY OR MAYBE A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT WHAT. TO ALLAY THOSE CONCERNS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN KEEP THE STAY ON TRACK TO MEET ITS OF HER PERCENT RENEWABLE GOAL. YEAH WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. IS TO ALLOW THE INDUSTRIES TO WORK WITH OUR DEPARTMENT TO COME UP WITH BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES -- WORKING TOGETHER SO NOT THE STATE SAYS THIS IS WHAT YOU GOT THEM EVENT BUT THE INDUSTRY SAYING THESE ARE THE BEST THESE ARE THE THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO PROTECT. OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT TO BE IN AGREEMENT WITH IT AND SUPPOSE HAVE K. WELL LET'S JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN -- PULL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BEST MANAGER PRACTICE THAT WE ALL CAN AGREE ON INTO YOU KNOW IT'S TO YOUR THIS NOT THE ONLY BILL I'M AWARE OF THAT'S ATTEMPTING TO PUSH BACK AGAINST ANY. OF FEDERAL ROLLBACKS OF ENVIRONMENTAL WORKER PROTECTIONS OF THE PRO TEM HAS SENATE BILL ONE HOW DOES THIS BILL INTERACT WITH WITH THAT. THANK YOU I I THINK IT'S IT'S CONSISTENT -- BUT THOSE OTHER BILLS -- AND I THINK THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY UNIQUE. IN THAT IT'S NOT JUST PUSHING BACK IS BASICALLY SAYING CALIFORNIA WANTS OPERATE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN OPERATING WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE COURSE OF FEDERAL LAW. SO IT'S REALLY. UP TO THE THE GOP ADMINISTRATIONS PULLING BACK AND WE'RE JUST SAYING HEY LET'S JUST KEEP DOING WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR DECADES. WELL IN IN THE THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF SENATOR ATKINS INTENT -- WITH HER LEGISLATION OF NINETEEN THE STATUS QUO LIKE NO BY NOT ROLLING BACK MEANS WE'RE CONTINUING. THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS OPERATED THE TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE BILLS COULD BE COMPLEMENTARY OR PERHAPS -- Và STATED THAT THE OTHER DAY ABOUT A SPECIFIC BILL ONE THERE I DIDN'T HEAR THE SAME CONCERN SO I MONEY IF THERE'S APPROACH IN THAT BILL THAT -- COULD BE PUT INTO THIS ONE ARE SOMEHOW HARMONIZED OR WHATEVER -- BUT WHEN HEARING FROM YOU IS A IS A CLEAR INTENT TO NOT. DISRUPT OF OUR HARM IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO ME THAT -- THERE ARE NUMBER CHALLENGES IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY CURRENTLY. WHETHER IT'S WILD FIRES -- IT MAKES UTILITY BANKRUPTCY SO ON SO FORTH SO IT'S A FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD BE ON ON WHAT'S FAVORITE YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE CONCERNED -- SO I'D ASK YOU CONTINUE DO THAT WORK -- I DON'T REPRESENT THAT I UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF AG AND SOME THE OTHER FOLKS AS WELL AS I DO -- SOLAR SHE WHICH IS THERE'S ABUNDANCE OF AND IN SAN DIEGO -- IN SO -- WITH WITH YOUR IN CURRENT WITH YOUR COMMITMENT -- I I APPRECIATE THAT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. TO VOTE -- FOR ANYTHING THE FEDERAL MINISTRATION IS PURSUING IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF OF ENVIRONMENTAL. PROTECTION. GIVEN THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE INTENT IS THERE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR INTENT IS. CHOOSE BETWEEN TRUMP IN CAR I THINK I KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA BE GOING -- IN SO I JUST ASK YOU CAN TO WORK WITH THOSE INDUSTRIES A TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING TO HARM A WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH RELATIVE -- TO TO CLIMATE CHANGE PROTECTING THE BIRD IS REALLY IS IS NICE BUT THE PLAN IS ALSO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU MISTER JERRY I AGREE A TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE DESTRUCTIVE OF SOLAR AND WIND BUT A DESTRUCTIVE A BAG OF FORESTRY IN OTHER INDUSTRIES AS WELL THAT OUR CREDIT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. TO CALIFORNIA. IN A QUESTIONS PLEASE DOCTOR. YEAH I HAVE A SOME -- TECHNICOLOR FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. I I KNOW YOUR SPIRIT -- IN PROTECTION OF MIGRATORY OUT BIRDS -- HOWEVER -- THIS IS SAW -- IN. CONTRADICTION TO OFF. OF FEDERAL POLICY. HOW MANY TIMES SO WHAT WHAT? NOT HOW MANY TIMES SO IT WOULD BE A STATE. THE REGULATIONS EVERY TIME WHEN WE DON'T AGREE WITH THE FEDERAL -- POLICY THAN WE HAVE TO SET OUR OWN POLICY WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THE ISSUE US. CONSTITUTION DEFINES SO WHETHER -- OUR STATE HAS A A WAR RIGHT -- TO PROCEED. WITH OUR OWN. REGULATIONS IN DEFIANCE OF THE FEDERAL POLICY. IT'S NOT DEFIANCE -- OUR STATE HAS THE RIGHT. TO HAVE MORE STRINGENT RULES AS IS CURRENTLY BACK WITHOUT THIS BILL CURRENT LAW ALREADY ALLOWS THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. TO CONFORM WITH OR TO FURTHER RESTRICT THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PRESCRIBED PRESCRIBED UNDER MBTA. SO. YOU KNOW I THINK STATES DO HAVE A RIGHT. AB TO BE ABLE TO BUT HAVE SELF DETERMINATION ESPECIALLY AS IT APPLIES TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS PROTECTING OUR FOR PRESS THE TECHNO COMMUNITY. NOW. AS HER LUCK AMARE ONE I INDUSTRY ALSO WE ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA LAW AND THE FEDERAL AND WE AT THAT HAS CREATED A LOT ABOUT YOU KNOW PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THIS MAY BE AN UP AND ON THE HILL. CONFLICTING ISSUE AND THE HOW -- WE MAY RUN INTO LAW. YEAH [inaudible] MANY OTHER. ON INTENDED CONSEQUENCES UP BY CREATING OUR IN ALL THE REGULATIONS WELL THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW -- CANNABIS HAS NEVER BEEN LEGAL UP THE MBTA WAS FEDERAL LAW FOR A HUNDRED YEARS UP UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO -- AND SO I THERE'S A BIG DISTINCTION THERE WERE BASICALLY UP STRENGTHENING A RULE THAT CURRENTLY EXIST EVEN NOW STILL THE MBTA STILL IN FORCE OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS THIS BEEN NARROWED DRAMATICALLY. SO THIS IS JUST A A A STRENGTHENING OF CURRENT FEDERAL LAW. IF I COULD ADD TO SERVE. AMONG THE TO THERE. THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF CODE INCLUDING FISHING GAME CODE THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED WHICH MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO TAKE. NATIVE BIRDS AT THIRTY FIVE OH THREE WHICH LEADS TO PER BIRDS NESTS AND EGGS THIRTY FIVE OH THREE WHICH SPECIFICALLY A RAPTOR. SO THERE'S A LOT OF PARTS OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE THAT PROVIDE THESE FLAT PROHIBITIONS ON THE TAKE OF MIGRATORY BIRDS AND HAVE FOR DECADES. AND SO THE CLICK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE IS THAT NOW THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE FEDERAL INTERPRETATION OF MBTA THAT IS INTRODUCED THIS INCONGRUITY POTENTIALLY. WITHIN THE FIT WITHIN THE STATE FISH AND GAME CODE. BUT THOSE DOES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN. THE THE RIGHT OF THE STATE -- TO MANAGE ATTENTION WILDLIFE IS EMBEDDED IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND RECOGNIZED BY THE US SUPREME COURT IS REALLY PROVINCE OF EACH STATE. AS PART OF ITS SOVEREIGN RIGHT SO WE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE IN THAT RESPECT -- THE WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE HOW TO REGULATE OUR FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE STATE. THANK YOU HE THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA NIGHT. MISS MOST THE PRESENTATION BUT I'VE I'VE KIND OF BEEN LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. YOU KNOW I I THINK THIS YOU KNOW. JUST ON THE PERSON MY PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK THE PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS ESPECIALLY LIKE IN THE AGRICULTURAL. FIELD LIKE -- UP. OF ALL MAKE A AN ANALOGY TO CLEAN WATER ACT -- SO. THERE WAS GONNA BE A A VERY LARGE EXPANSION OF CLEAN WATER ACT UNDER FEDERAL LAW EPA WAS FORMALLY IN ITS RULES -- AND WE HAD HAD A CONSISTENT. VERY CLEAR DEFINITION OF CLEAN WATER ACT ESPECIALLY IN YOU KNOW WELL. IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS BUT WE KNEW LIKE HEY THIS IS THIS IS A WETLAND THIS IS. WHAT'S CONSIDERED. YOU KNOW -- NEIL -- FILL IN A WET LANDER OR HAVE IN A DISCHARGE -- AND WITH THOSE NEW RULES WERE BEING PROMULGATED IT WAS GONNA DRASTICALLY IMPACT LIKE JUST THE ABILITY TO LIKE SAY PLAN A FIELD. READ TO GO PLAN A NEW ORCHARD WAR -- TO OR EVEN TO DO ROUTINE PRACTICES SUCH AS CULTIVATION -- AND OTHER THINGS AND AND IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE EVEN A RICE FIELD. YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE LIFE FORM WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A WETLAND EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY A WETLAND BECAUSE WE'VE MADE IT SUCH RIGHT WE FLOOD THE FIELD. ON PURPOSE -- AND SO YOUNG THESE DRASTIC EXPANSIONS THERE'S WORD DOES WERE ULTIMATELY STOPPED RIGHT THAT RULED THAT RULE MAKING THE STOPPED. AND THEN NOW. THE STATE WATER BOARD IS CONSIDERING THEIR OWN RULES -- AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT ARE GOING TO BASICALLY TAKE IT TO THAT LEVEL AND SO. IN THE SAME WAY I FEEL LIKE. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF REGULATIONS ARE PRETTY STRINGENT -- AND THE MINUTE WE GET A LITTLE BIT A REGULATORY RELIEF IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE STATE COMES GOES WELL NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT REGULATORY RELIEF WE'RE GONNA. EVEN TAKE IT UP A NOTCH OR IN THIS CASE TAKE IT BACK -- TO WHERE IT WAS AND I MEAN IN YOUR SPECIFIC CASE I THINK IT'S REALLY MORE ABOUT UNINTENTIONAL TAKE. RIGHT AN INCIDENTAL TAKE. AND CERTAINLY NOBODY'S OUT THERE GOING MAN WE WANT. TO YOU KNOW JUST ANNIHILATE BIRD POPULATIONS. YOU KNOW AS AS AS A HUNTER AS A AS A MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION WHICH IS A SUPPORTER OF YOUR BILL -- WE WANT TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF OF OUR WATER FALLON OUR IN OUR BIRD POPULATIONS IN THE STATE'S BIG PART OF THE ECONOMY IT'S AND JUST BY VIRTUE OF THE SPECIES ITSELF IS CRITICAL RIGHT -- BUT ALSO IN IN CONDUCTING. ROUTINE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES NOW WITH THE BURGEONING SOLAR INDUSTRY AND WIND INDUSTRY RIGHT. THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME INCIDENTAL TAKES THAT ARE NOT INTENTIONAL OR NOT TRYING. TO YOU KNOW -- YOU'RE NOT INTENSELY GOING OUT AND TRYING TO YOU KNOW HAVE AN IMPACT ON THAT BIRD POPULATION. BUT THIS IS GOING TO AND SO NOW WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF REALLY FUN THAT ONLY TO HAVE A GO. RIGHT BACK. TO A MORE STRINGENT ENFORCEMENT OF THAT RIGHT SO. ARE YOU SEE YOU SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM THERE I MEAN THERE'S CAN WE GET A BREAK. WELL CAN I GUESS WHERE I'M GUY I MEAN LOOK AT THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH. COMPLAINTS THERE'S BEEN OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS FROM INDUSTRY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS WAS BEEN IN PLACE. THE ROLE BY NECESSITY HAS TO BE REGARDING INSTEAD I'LL TAKE BECAUSE INTENTIONALLY TAKES ALREADY ILLEGAL. UNLESS YOU HAVE A PERMIT. SO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY INCIDENTAL TAKE IS HOW YOU PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS AND HAS BEEN. A TREATY FOR A HUNDRED YEARS IT'S BEEN FEDERAL PRACTICE FOR FORTY YEARS HAS BEEN THE STATE'S PRACTICE FOR DECADES. AND SO THIS IS JUST SAYING EVERYTHING'S WORKING JUST FINE. WHY YOU KNOW BLOW A AND THIS IS NOT JUST A SLIGHT MODIFICATION THIS IS ABSOLUTELY GETTING RID OF ANY RULE REGARDING AS THAT'LL TAKE? WHICH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE AGAIN OUR INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN THRIVING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT OTHERS HAVE BEST PRACTICES LET'S TRY TO MITIGATE IT NO ONE'S BEEN PROSECUTED OPENS BERMAN. YOU WILL FIND I MEAN IT'S REALLY ABOUT JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN AND WORKING WITH OUR DEPARTMENT MAKES WOULD BE THE BEST WE CAN -- IT AND THAT'S WHAT HAS BEEN THE PRACTICE AND SO I DIDN'T HEAR AN OUTCRY BEFORE. IN A DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OR BEFORE FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OF THE TRUMP MINISTRATION TWO WEEKS INTO THE MINISTRATION ALL OF A SUDDEN. COUNTERING THE PRACTICE OF ADMINISTRATIONS BACK TO THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION DECIDED TO STOP ENFORCING -- AND THEN CHANGED WITH THE THE INTERPRETATION ALTOGETHER -- THERE WASN'T A BIG OUTCRY FROM INDUSTRY WHETHER BE ABITIBI SOLAR OF A YOU BE TIMBER. THE LAST FORTY YEARS. IN SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT OUR INDUSTRY KNOWS HOW TO DO IT. AND OF COURSE OUR INDUSTRY TO THE BEST THEY CAN UPDATE THE WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST. OF MITIGATION PRACTICES IN THE WORLD IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THE CONTINUE. AND NOT ROLL THEM BACK A IT DOES IT DOES PRACTICES WERE IN PLACE AND THEY'RE IN PLACE BECAUSE THE MBTA NOT BECAUSE THE MBTA'S IN A COME AFTER WHAT THE HAMMER. BUT THE MBTA'S HAS US WORK TOGETHER MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN TO PROTECT. OF THESE MIGRATORY BIRDS IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT A IN AND I GET THAT WHEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY GET OUT FROM REGULATION INDUSTRY WILL OFTENTIMES TAKE IT I AM. THAT'S FINE THAT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE PRESENT ARE PROBABLY TO TO TO SAY THAT'S OKAY -- IT OKAY THINGS ARE WORKING FINE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY THE DEPARTMENT'S ALWAYS WORKED WELL WITH INDUSTRY IN THIS CASE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT'S BEEN THE CASE FOR DECADES. OUR STATE DEPARTMENT CAN'T DISABLE WE'RE JUST GONNA FALL THE GUIDANCE OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY DECIDED TO COMPLETELY BUT CUT OUT ANY CONSIDERATION FOR INCIDENTAL TAKE WHICH IS. COMPLETELY COUNTER TO THE PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS UNDER THE TREATY AT LEAST FOR DECADES UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND UNDER CALIFORNIA PRACTICE. I THINK THAT I THINK YOUR ARGUMENT THERE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE YOU KNOW AND AND AND IN TERMS OF HEY THIS IS HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN RIGHT -- WHAT I WOULD JUST? SAVE YOU AN AND I HOPE MAYBE SOME WE COULD WORK ON IS LIKE LET'S TRY AND KEEP THAT STATUS YOU KNOW AT LEAST KEEP THAT. THAT STATUS QUO. BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG PART OF THIS IS JUST THE UNCERTAINTY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UNDER. I THINK YOU MAY GET ARGUMENT HEY THERE'S NO UNCERTAINTY HERE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN THAT WAY RIGHT NOW. BUT LIKE FOR INSTANCE IN THESE WETLAND RULES THAT WERE ABOUT TO PROMULGATE WILL NOT THAT WE ARE BUT THAT THE REGULATORY BODIES WITHOUT OUR WITHOUT ANY OF OUR AND PUT IT REALLY. ARE ABOUT TO PROMULGATE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD -- YOU KNOW WE NEED THE BODY BEEN OPERATING AGAIN JUST AS YOU ARGUED WE'VE BEEN OPERATE UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT IT'S HEY THESE ARE THE RULES AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE GONNA LIKE. DRASTICALLY EXPAND RIGHT SO I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY. A LOT OF MERIT TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS LIKE HEY KEEP THINGS WHERE THEY'RE AT SO THE PEOPLE HAVE THAT EXPECTATION AND NO. WHAT'S COMING FORWARD. IS THAT I I AGREE 1100% ON I THINK THESE ARE NEW RULES AND WITH A 100% AS OPPOSED TO THE WEATHER WAS THE HOUSE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE ARE NEW RULES AND I AGREE I I I DON'T. THIS SHOULDN'T BE USED AS A NEW AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT TO THESE INTERVIEW THAT'S NOT WITH THE INTENTION IS REALLY IS AS HEY LET'S JUST KEEP DOING WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. THAT'S CODIFIED IN STATE LAW WHICH WE DIDN'T NEED TO DO UP UNTIL COVERED YEARS WE DIDN'T NEED TO CODIFY THE STATE LAW NOW WE NEED TO CODIFY IT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE WAY WE'VE BEEN OPERATING AND SO THAT'S FULLY MY INTENTION. AGAIN -- TO WORK WITH ALL THESE INDUSTRIES TO MAKE FOR THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THESE INDUSTRIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN OPERATE IN A WAY THAT SUCCESSFUL AND WORKS FOR THEM. BUT AT LEAST HAS SOME BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN TERMS OF PRODUCING ABOUT A CELTIC KNOT ELIMINATING IT OTHER GOING TO BRING UP A LOT OF BIRDS ARE GOING TO DIE. THAT'S PART OF WHAT THESE INDUSTRIES THEY CAN'T HELP IT IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IT. THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO KILL A SINGLE BIRD -- BUT BIRDS ARE GOING TO DIE WHAT CAN WE DO TO MINIMIZE THAT AS BEST WE CAN WHILE ON THESE INDUSTRIES OPERATE. OF PRACTICALLY. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU DO HAVE A MOTION SECOND IT DOES HAVE A TO PASS. TO SOME APPROPRIATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SHARE THAT THEM MY HOPE IS THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING WITH -- THE OPPOSITION -- IF I RECALL CORRECTLY -- THERE MAY HAVE BEEN LESS OPPOSITION LAST. GO AROUND WITH THE PREVIOUS BILL IN IT. HAD A CHALLENGE GETTING OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AND SOME HOPEFUL THAT THERE WILL BE. SOME DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND HAVE EXPRESSED A CONCERN IN SOME INSTANCES IT SEEMS LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME. WORD SMITHING THAT WOULD CLARIFY. CERTAIN TENSE ODD TO GIVE SOME FOLKS THAT CERTAINTY THAT. NOTHING REALLY HERE'S CHANGING BEYOND WHAT THE PRACTICES THEN FOR FOUR DECADES ALREADY HAS BEEN REITERATED HERE. AND IN OTHER INSTANCES OR MAY NOT BE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO -- TO CHANGE -- THE POSITION BUT NEVERTHELESS I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU'LL. CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM ARE OURS OUR TEAM HERE IS PREPARED TO HELP FACILITATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN. HOPES THAT THE BILL MOVES OUT APPROPRIATIONS IN THAT IT'S ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AND GETS TO SUPPORT. THE NEED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD SO THAT'S MY CLOSING. I THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THE BILL THERE'S A MOTION A SECOND. US FOR ROCCA. THE MOTION IS TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. EDUARDO GARCIA. GARCIA I GALLAGHER.
