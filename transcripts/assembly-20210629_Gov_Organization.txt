I CAN TALK REALLY LOUD YOU KNOW COME ON UP HERE TO MY MIND. PLEASE YEAH IF THEY CAN TURN IT ON. TRY THIS ONE HERE NOW THIS IS WORKING YEAH A TERRIFIC OKAY THANK YOU SORRY- FUTURE EMPLOYMENT AT THIS CHAIR MEMBERS THANK U. S. B. NINETEEN WOULD ALLOW WILL WANT LICENSE WINE AND BRANDY MANUFACTURES TO HAVE TO OFF SITE TASTING ROOMS UNDER EXISTING LAW TYPE TWO ONE GROVER LICENSEES ARE ALLOWED TO TASTING ROOMS ONE ON SITE AT THE PRODUCTION FACILITY AND A SECOND ONE OFF SITE. OUT WHEN I TOWARD MY DISTRICTS- WINE REGION AND I HAVE ABOUT SIXTY WINERIES IN MY AREA MOST OF THEM VERY SMALL ONE THING I KEPT HEARING WAS THAT MANY WINERIES ARE STRUGGLING TO OPERATE UNDER ALTERNATING PROPRIETORSHIP AGREEMENTS WHICH ALLOW WINE MAKER TO PRODUCE THEIR WINE AT ANOTHER WINERIES PRODUCTION FACILITIES HIS AGREEMENTS ARE OFTEN USED BY SMALL FAMILY OWNED WINERIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES TO PROCESS. THEIR OWN GRAVES. WHEN A WINERY ENTERS INTO THESE AGREEMENTS THEY MUST USE THEIR MASTER LICENSE. AND THE ACCOMPANYING RIGHT TO AN ON SITE TASTING ROOM TO COVER THE BORROWED FACILITY AND PRACTICES ALMOST ALWAYS MEANS THAT THE WINERIES OPERATING UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE PROHIBITED FROM HAVING A TASTING ROOM AT THEIR PRODUCTION FACILITY SINCE THE HOST WINERY USUALLY ISN'T WILLING TO SHARE THEIR TASTING ROOM WITH THE- LEASING WINERY. IN ADDITION TO THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM FOR WINERIES IN ALTERNATING PROPRIETORSHIPS. THE INTEL ENTIRE CALIFORNIA WINE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN CHALLENGED BY BILLIONS OF LOST REVENUE AND DAMAGES FROM THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND WILDFIRES. ALL CALIFORNIA WINERIES BIG AND SMALL WOULD BENEFIT BY GIVING THEM THE OPTION TO OPEN ONE MORE OFF SITE TASTING ROOM. SMALL WINERIES IN ALTERNATING PROPRIETORSHIPS WOULD HAVE A SECOND TASTING ROOM WHILE LARGER WINERIES WOULD STILL HAVE THE INCENTIVE TO INVEST IN THEIR OWN PRODUCTION FACILITIES. THIS ALLOW ALL WINERIES TO PLAY ON THE SAME PLAYING FIELD FOR PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR SMALL WINERIES RELY HEAVILY ON DIRECT SALES TWO TASTING ROOMS. IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL PRESERVES LOCAL CONTROL BECAUSE- BECAUSE THE NEW TASTING ROOMS WOULD STILL NEED COME TO COMPLY WITH ALL LOCAL ZONING. REQUIREMENTS WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY ARE TIM SCHMELZER IN THE WINE INSTITUTE. AND STEVE THERE IS A- FROM THE STEVEN KENT WINERY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THOSE IN THE GALLERY. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TO SPEAK. SEEING NONE.

WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE PHONES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OPERATOR. GIVE MODERATE HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY. IF YOU'RE PART OF SB NINETEEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND ANY WITNESSES MADE. YOU HAVE AN OPEN LINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. MY NAME IS STEVEN CAN'T BEAR A SOUP SIX GENERATION WINEMAKER AND SHOULDN'T TELL THE LINEAGE COLLECTION LOCATED IN THE HISTORIC LIVERMORE VALLEY. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR GLAZER AND HIS TEAM FOR THEIR MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT FOR SMALL WIND RESEARCH IS MINE. ALMOST 85% OF ALL WHINERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CLASSIFIED AS SMALL WHICH GENERALLY MAKES THEM UNSUITABLE FOR WIDE SCALE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION. THESE WINERIES NEED THEIR TASTING ROOMS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE COMPETITIVE BUSINESS. ABOUT 75% OF MY SALES ORDER WINE CLUB MEMBERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND THE PANDEMIC OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN MONTHS IS PROOF THAT DIRECT TO CONSUMER SALES ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL. TO OUR SURVIVAL. AS A WIDELY WITH THE GPS. I ONLY HAVE LEGAL ACCESS TO ONE TASTED. WHICH PUTS ME IN MIND THESE ARE QITE A LARGE COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. PASSAGE OF SB NINETEEN WOULD EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD AND ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE OR FAVORABLY. THOUSANDS OF OTHER WHITE LOCAL TASTING ROOMS. ALL PEACEKEEPERS ARE GOVERNED BY STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. BECAUSE OF THIS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS ON WILL BE HANDLED RESPONSIBLY. AND THEN ORGANIZED FASHION. FOR THE SAKE OF SMALL FAMILY OWNED BY GENERATIONAL PURPOSES LIKE MINE I. REFUSE TO PASS SB NINETEEN.
