SENATE ASSEMBLY JOINT RULES COMMITTEE THIS IS THE FIFTH CONVENE IN OF THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE ON THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL BUILDING ANNEX PROJECT. AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT PRIOR TO THIS THE STARTED GIVING ON THIS THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE AS A BODY HAD NOT MET. HER SIX TEEN YEARS. SO WE ARE NOW PICKING UP THE THREAD AGAIN OF THIS CONVERSATION OF WHAT TO DO WITH OUR STATE CAPITOL. THE ANNEX PORTION WHICH WE'RE SHEER FINISH IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO. AND IN AS MUCH AS WE ARE LITERALLY YEARS AND COUNTLESS HOURS INTO THIS EFFORT. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T THANK ALL THE STAFF WHO ASSISTED. US OF COURSE JOINT RULES. SENATE ASSEMBLY RULE SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL GIRL WHO IS REPRESENT HERE OR DIE AND BORDER VINE BUT- SHE'S PUT A LOT OF RESOURCE IN THIS PROJECT ACROSS MANY YEARS. OUR BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL OF HEAVY LIFTING ON THIS EFFORT AS WELL AS OF COURSE THE LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES BOTH PARTIES. WE HAVE GREAT PARTICIPATION AGAIN ACROSS THE SPAN OF YEARS DEPARTMENT PLANS TGS WAS WELL REPRESENTED HERE TODAY. AND EVEN OUR FACILITIES PARTNERS BUT ALSO IN OUR COMMITTEE STRUCTURE ARE EDUCATION COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS HELPING US THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE NARRATIVE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE WOULD CONVEY. WELL AS YOU WELCOME PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING SO WE'VE USED PRETTY MUCH EVERY RESOURCE THE LEGISLATURE HAS. THAT IS RELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT HAS LENT THEIR EFFORT. AND. V. WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER IN JULY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE QUESTION IS REALLY HOW DO WE TACKLE THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE ANNEX BUILDING FINISH IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO WHICH A SHORTLIST INCLUDES ADA PROBLEMS ASBESTOS PROBLEMS SECURITY RELATED ISSUES AND JUST THE AGING OF ITS SYSTEMS WHICH THAT WAS ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED INITIALLY UNDER GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER SDGS COMMISSION A LARGE STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. PUTTING TOGETHER THE IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES IN THIS BUILDING. BUT AS WE APPROACHED SEATED AS A LEGISLATURE WE'VE NEVER LOST TRACK OF THIS VERY UNIQUE KEY IDEA TO THIS BILL IN STANDS ALONE THE STATE'S INVENTORY AS THE LEGISLATURE'S BUILDING IS IDENTIFIED AS THE LECTURES HAVE CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT CODE. AND EVERY UNDERTAKING CONCERN AND FROM THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION THE ANNEX IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO THE REBUILD OF THE WEST WING BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND EIGHTY TWO AND EVEN DEALING WITH Y. TWO K. AND THE INTERNAL SYSTEMS OF THE LEGISLATURE ALL THIS IS BEEN A MEASURE BY THE LEGISLATURE ON ITS BEHALF IN AS MUCH AS THE BUILDING IS THE HOME OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. PROCESS ARM. AND WE'VE WE'VE ACHIEVED A LOT SO WE NOW HAVE TWO BIG NEW CRANES A BLOCK AWAY BEHIND ELLO B. IS TGS IS MOVING WITH THE UTMOST ALACRITY TO CREATE SWING SPACE WHERE WE CAN MOVE WE ARE JOINED TODAY ON THE AGENDA BY MISTER DAVID HART WHO JOINED US AT OUR JULY TWENTY SEVENTEEN MEETING. ARE AS REALLY THE PRO FROM DOVER HE'S WORKED ON A GREAT MANY STATE CAPITOL RE BILLS CARRYING THE WATER ON BEHALF OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS A LEGISLATURE SO UTAH MINNESOTA WYOMING THESE GET INVOLVED IN MISSOURI HIS PARTNER'S BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN IDAHO AND WE TALKED OVERLY ON. BUT THEN WE WENT TO NCSL IN NCSL COMMITTED. CONSIDER GET NO MISTER DAVID HEART AS SOMEONE WHO MIGHT ASSIST US. HE HAS BEEN A CONSULTANT TO US BUT NOW WE WERE ACTUALLY RETAINED HIM AS THE OWNERS REPRESENT TO KINDA HELP DRIVE THE PROJECT ALONG. AND HE'S VERY DEEP IN THE PROCESS OF BRINGING TO. A FINAL FORM SOMETHING KNOWN AS THE PROJECT JOVIAL SEQUENCING REPORT WHICH HE WILL TALK ABOUT. BUT STATUTES ADOPTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE COMMITTED TO ESTABLISHING A PROCESS THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THE SCOPE BUDGET DELIVER WEAPONS SCHEDULE THE CAP LAST PROJECT THAT IS BEING MEMORIALIZED IN THIS PROJECT OVERVIEWS SEQUENCING DOCUMENT WHICH MISTER HART IS A SUMMIT FOR US AND OUR PARTNERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND MR HERTZBERG HERE AS MY TEAM MADE ON BEHALF OF THE SENATE MOVING THIS ALONG. AND SO WE'LL BE HEARING ABOUT THAT. THERE'S SO MUCH THE WE'VE GOT DONE IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE BUT FOR BILLS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. DEAL WITH VARIOUS FACETS OF THIS PROJECT STARTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. WE HAD A AND ANNEX WEBSITE THAT WE GOT UP TO RUN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT'S CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED IN FACT BEEN SIGNIFICANT REVAMPED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO IMPROVE ITS ADA COMPLIANCE. OUR OUR FIRST PROCUREMENT ON THE PROJECT WAS TO RETAIN A ARCHITECTURAL FIRM CSE CHIU WAY OF WEST SACRAMENTO NIGHT OWL. AND YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR. TWENTY EIGHT TWO THEY PRODUCED THIS PLANET STUDY. AND THAT PLAN IS A REMAINS SORT OF THE MARK OR THE BENCHMARK FOR ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH THE BUILDING A WHAT IS THE CHARACTER OF A PEOPLE'S HOUSE WE MIGHT WISH TO CONSTRUCT THAT WAS OUR FIRST PROCUREMENT. THE OF. WE SPENT. ABOUT THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS OF GOVERNOR BROWN TO TERM IN VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION WITH THE EXACT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE TGS AND OUR PARTNERS IN THE SENATE IS SIMPLY JUST WORKING ON THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FOR HOW WE WOULD ADMINISTER THE PROJECT AND THAT WAS MEMORIALIZED IN ANIMAL YOU MEMORANDUM UNDERSTANDING EXECUTED ON NOVEMBER NINTH OF LAST YEAR AND THAT COMMITTEE ERIN SERVE THEIR DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS GOVERNOR SOME SO HERTZBERG AND I HAS BEEN UP. MEDIAN MONTHLY SINCE FEBRUARY AND MAKING. ESTABLISH A I WOULD SAY A GOOD PATTERN PRACTICE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE SURE I POINT OUT FOR MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS MEETING. YOU KNOW LET'S SAY PROJECTS ARE SO UNUSUAL BECAUSE THEY IMPOSE A TINY ON US. BECAUSE WE OPERATE IN THE TWO YEAR BIENNIUM. BUT WE'RE ALWAYS BUSY THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF EVERY YEAR SO LET'S SAY FOR. IN THE EVEN NUMBERED YEAR WERE BUSY THAT FOURTH QUARTER WAS ELECTIONS. SHE REALLY LET'S SAY PROJECTS HAVE TO BE TIME SO IF THERE IS MOVEMENT INVOLVED OF LAWMAKER OFFICES. YOU HAVE TO TIME IT TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF AN ODD NUMBERED YEAR. BECAUSE THAT'S A TIME WHEN WE CAN ACTUALLY SUFFER THE DESTRUCTION. TERROR HERE OUT FOR A COUPLE WEEKS AND THEN SETTLE DOWN AND BE PREPARED TO DO OUR WORK. SO A BASIC TIMING OF THIS WHOLE ENTERPRISE WHICH IS MOVING ALONG AGGRESSIVELY. HAS IN MIND THAT D. G. S. WELCOME TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SWING SPACE BILLION BY THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. PERMITTING THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE MOVING TO THAT NEW FACILITY IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN THAT THIS PROJECT COULD BE UNDERTAKEN AND CONCLUDED TO PERMIT US TO MOVE BACK IN IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND IT'S SORT OF THIS THING I DIFFER WHAT MY COLLEAGUES TO REALIZE YOU KNOW OUR LEGISLATIVE SCHEDULE AND DOES IMPOSES TIME CONSTRAINT. ARM AND THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO POINT ON YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS FROM MISTER HART TODAY. SINCE EARLY IN THIS YEAR WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY VERY HARD WITH THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP ON. THE VISITOR CENTER. HOW DO WE ROLL OUT THE WELCOME MAT TO CALIFORNIA'S WHEN THEY COME HERE OR OTHERS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE WERE JUST INTERESTED IN A PHENOMENON OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE FIRST PART CHIEF JUSTICE. ARE SENATE ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. AND WE CONVENE DATE A EARLY ENVISIONED WORKSHOP AT THE END OF APRIL THIS YEAR. AND ALL OF USE YOU CAME BACK FROM BREAK. WOULD HAVE FOUND COPIES OF THIS PICTURE BOOK IN YOUR IN BOX WHICH IS THE- ACCOUNT OF WHAT WENT ON IN THAT EARLY ENVISIONS SESSION. SO THINGS ARE MOVING ALONG WITH THE UTMOST SPEED AND. I JUST DELIGHTED TO BE BACK AGAIN AS WE UNDERTAKE THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC WORK. AND I WOULD LIKE TO TURN AT THIS TIME OF I MADE TO MY VICE CHAIR OF CENTER MONEY FOR SOME REMARKS. YEAH THANK YOU CHAIR COOLEY IN I JUST WANT TO LEAD OFF EXPRESSING MY APPRECIATION FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP EVEN BRACED THIS PROJECT IN ITS MULTI FACETED WITH A PASSION YOUR COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIAN AS YOU MENTION THIS IS. THIS IS THE HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE IT'S ALSO A PUBLIC HOUSE IF I'M CORRECT WE'VE HEARD RECEIVED MORE VISITORS EVERY YEAR THAN DISNEYLAND. SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY WE'RE BUILDING FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT IS CORRECT TO DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS WE'RE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A SECURE. EIGHTY EIGHT COMPLIANT SAFE SPACE FOR THOSE MILLIONS OF VISITORS WHO COME THROUGH ON EVERY YEAR THE CHAIR ALSO MENTIONED WHEN YOU OF KNOWLEDGE MEANING I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THE NAMES IN THE TITLES BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE STAFF THAT HAVE PULLED TOGETHER FROM DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO CONSULTANTS. TO OUR LEDGE COUNCIL EVERYONE OUR SECURITY LEADERS IN BOTH HOUSES. THIS IS A MAMMOTH UNDERTAKING I THINK ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS THE CHAIR MENTIONED THIS THE VERY STRICT TIMETABLES FOR. CONSTRUCTING THE SWING SPACE MOVING INTO IT GETTING ESTABLISHED AND THEN A QUICK MOVE BACK TO THE NEW SPACE TIMING IS EVERYTHING AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL WE REMEMBER THAT THE SWING SPACE WE WANT TO BE ACCESSIBLE SAFE ANA IN UTILITARIAN BUT IT IS TEMPORARY IN SWING SPACE AND WE NEED TO DOWHAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE. THE SWING HAPPEN ACCORDING TO TIME TABLE. IN MAKE SURE THAT WE STAY ON TARGET FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW THE NEW ANNEX BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE UPDATES TODAY I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR HERTZBERG HAS ALSO. BEEN WITH HIS EXPERIENCES OF FORMER SPEAKER IN THE ASSEMBLY AND ALSO HAVING OVERSIGHT OF BUILDING ISSUES IN. PEOPLE MOVEMENT MANAGEMENT ISSUES HILL OFFER HIS THOUGHTS AND OVER SITES AS WELL BUT- THIS IS ONE PROJECT THAT WILL HAVE A LEGACY THAT WILL OUTLAST ALL OF THIS. AND IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COMPOSITION OF JOINT RULES. WHERE WE CAN REALLY PULL TOGETHER IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER SHARING COMMON OBJECTIVES OF BUILDING THAT NEXT SAFE SECURE ADA COMPLIANT. SPACE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS IN THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER POSSIBLE SO AGAIN. THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO'S HERE TODAY IN BEYOND THE WALLS OF THE HEARING ROOM TODAY TO ALL THOSE WHO WILL BE PARTNERS AS WE MOVE THIS VISION FORWARD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ALSO THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH. IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF ADDITIONS OBVIOUSLY MISTER ALVAREZ WHO WAS OUR FORMER SECRETARY AND ERICA CONTRAST OUT INSTRUMENTS IS WORKING FOR US IN THE SENATE. DEBORAH GRAY VIRTUES AND HERE TODAY BUT CERTAINLY JUST EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME INTO THIS OF COURSE THE UNBELIEVABLE ATTENTION THAT THE LEDGE COUNSEL'S OFFICE OTHERWISE ENGAGED IN MISTER KENNY WHO'S BEEN THE- A DEEPLY INVOLVED AT THE- GENERAL SERVICES. THE THING THAT I WANT. TO ADD YOU KNOW THE STRUCTURE AS THE CHAIR OF. KLAY NOTED AS WE HAVE AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WITH ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SENATE ONE REPRESENTS FROM THE ASSEMBLY. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT MEETS REGULARLY AND I SUSPECT IF I HAD TO PRINT OUT EVERYTHING THAT IS COME FROM THAT COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF. YEAH MONTHS SO IT'S PROBABLY TEN THOUSAND PAGES OF STUFF. THE UNDERTAKING IS NOTHING LESS THAN EXTRAORDINARY TO MEET THE GOALS THE DEADLINES THE COST AND TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THE UNDERLYING. ISSUES THE IN THE THING I JUST WANT TO ADD JUST QUICKLY IS THE GREAT CHALLENGE HERE. IS DESIGNING FOR THE FUTURE RIGHT DESIGNING FOR THE FUTURE TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND CREATIVE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS THIS BUILDING WILL REMAIN. THE BUILDING THAT WAS YOU WERE TAKING DOWN THE ANNEX BUT IN KIT BUT IN IN IN BEING INFORMED BY THE WEST WING OF THE OF THE CAPITAL WHICH WAS THE FULL CAPITAL FIGURING OUT HOW TO DESIGN THIS IN A WAY. THAT BOTH THAT CREATES IMAGINATION OF THINGS WE CAN THINK ABOUT TODAY BUT THINGS WE HAVEN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IN EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX ONE. THE GREATEST MINDS AT THE WORLD FAIRS WAS ASKED WHAT TO BROUGH WITH THEIR PREDICTIONS WERE FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS NO ONE THOUGHT OF THE AUTOMOBILE SHE WAS WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURES TO CREATE THOSE IN WAYS. THAT MAYBE THE CEILINGS ARE HIGH ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN BE CONVERTED TO OTHER SPACE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BE USING AUTOMOBILES OR NOT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE NECESSARY SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN OFFICES BUT THE FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE WALLS IN SPACES. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS LARGER COMPLEX OF NOT JUST THE BUILDING BUT THE LARGER CAPITAL COMMUNITY. WHEN I WAS SPEAKER CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE WHEN WE DID HAVE HEARINGS IN THIS COMMITTEE. WE HAD WE BOUGHT FROM GOV THEN GOVERNOR WHEELS TWO BUILDINGS IN THE IT WAS A DOLLAR APIECE ONE IS THE CURRENTLY THAT TEN TWENTY N. STREET ONE. ONE IS THE BUILDING THAT WAS BEHIND IT THAT HAD A BREAK. THAT WAS TORN DOWN. AND THE MADE FOR PARKING SPACES BECAUSE WE NEED MORE PARKING FOR AT THE BEFORE FOR STAFF AND THAT NOW BECOMES LOCATION. OF THE SWING SPACE WATER WATER ALL THE UNDERLYING DYNAMICS OF THE RELATIONSHIP NOW WE HAVE A LEGISLATIVE OFFICE BUILDING THAT HAS A LOT OF COMMITTEE ROOMS WHAT SECOND LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD. SWING SPACE WILL BE CONVERTED BACK IS. KID ACTOR GENERAL SERVICES. BUT WHAT WILL THERE BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE OFFICES OR ONE THAT'S NEEDED. AND SO THE GREAT ISSUE IN TERMS OF TIMING AND ALL THE HARD WORK BUT IT'S REALLY KIND OF THE FUN STUFF. TO TRY TO THINK THROUGH. BUT WHAT THE FUTURE'S GOING TO BE LIKE AND TO GIVE HIS GREATEST AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY. FOR FIGURING OUT ON THE FUTURE FOR REALLY MAKING THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND DEALING WITH ALL OF THOSE ISSUES SO IT IS BEEN QUITE CHALLENGING. WHITE REWARDING QUITE TIME CONSUMING BUT THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL OVER THESE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THE BODY OF OUR WORK WILL INFORM FUTURE GENERATIONS THAT WILL BE HAPPY. ABOUT THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND CREATIVITY AND HARD WORK THAT SO MANY PUT INTO TO HELP BUILD THE FUTURE. OF THIS GREAT CAPITAL IN THIS GREAT STATE. IF I MAY JUMP IN. I DO I APPRECIATE CENTERS FURS ALLUSION TO CREATIVITY. AND I WANT TO SAY TO ALL THE MEMBERS THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT A LOT OF WORK PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING PULLED TOGETHER ENVISIONED GUIDELINES. REALLY CREATIVITY IS TO WATCH FOR THIS PROJECT IN WHICH WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IN THE SENATE THE MEMBERS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CREATIVE THIS FLOWING. AND NOTHING YOU'RE GONNA HEAR PREAMPS FURTHER CREATIVITY. SO I DEFINITELY TODAY IS INFORMATION HEREIN BUT IT'S INVITATION JUST BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTICIPATING DEMOCRACY PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY MAYBE ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. WHAT OTHER THINGS WHICH ARE APT FOR ITS PURPOSE. AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO INVITE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE- THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CREATIVE IDEAS TO GET INTO. THIS CONVERSATION AND THE SHAPE WHERE WE GO ARE. ABUNDANT THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS SO TIED DOWN THAT WE CAN'T. REALLY ALTER ADULT TIME FRAMES BECOME AN ISSUE. WE HAVE OUR SECURITY PARTNERS HERE TODAY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TALKING THEM. FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE SOONER WE HAVE OUR SECURITY PLANS. IN MIND THE CHEAPER THEY ARE TO IMPLEMENT ENTER NOT SCREAM ATTHE LAST MINUTE TRYING TO. MEAN TEN SAFETY HERE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ON MY LEFT **** WILLIS SHE IS MY- RULES COMMITTEE SECRETARY. AND DEBORAH GRAVER OUR CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS IS INDISPOSED SHE IS AWAY ON PERSONAL MATTER THAT CANNOT WE CAN'T INTERFERE WITH. SO SHE WOULD ORDINARILY BE HERE SO NICOLE WERE I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WE'VE HAD A GREAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE- WITH THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION AS WE DO WITH THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION. AND DIRECTOR CAME OF DG **** IN THE ROOM THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE HE'S BEEN A CONSTANT PARTNER IN THE WHOLE EFFORT MOVING FORWARD. AND REALLY THE LYNCH PIN TO OUR PROJECT IS THE SWING SPACE WHICH IS BEING BUILT BY D. G. S. R. BASIC STATUTORY AUTHORITY IS THE D. G. S. WILL PURSUE. SWING SPACE AND WE WILL PURSUE THIS BUILDING SO THEY'RE EXECUTING ON WHAT IS THE PRECONDITION TO THIS PROJECT. THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO SAY IS I WOULD INVITE ANYONE HAVE QUESTIONS. TO TAKE NOTE YOUR QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK TURN NOW TO DIAL BORDER VINE FOR HER PRESENTATION. WILL HAVE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE A FOR AT THE END OF THAT THE LAST FASTER HARD TO RUN TO HIS PRESENTATION AND THEN TAKE UP QUESTIONS AT THE END. SO WITH THAT. COUNSELOR IS AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU HERE AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK OF YOU AND ALL YOUR PARTNERS. AND SO I. TURN OUT OF THAT PHASE OF OUR AGENDA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR INVITING ME TO UPDATE YOU ON THE PROGRESS THAT YOU'VE MADE TO FILL YOUR GOAL. IN BUILDING A NEW STATE CAPITOL ANNEX I AM GONNA GO BACK THROUGH SOME OF MY PREVIOUS TESTIMONY JUST TO REFRESH OUR MEMORIES ABOUT THE LAWS. THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED TO DATE. WE START OUT WITH TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED CHAPTER THIRTY ONE AND THE STATURE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH ADDED THE ARTICLE. THAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE STATE CAPITAL. BUILDING AN X. ACTIVE TWENTY SIXTEEN IN PARTICULAR SECTION NINE ONE ONE TWO OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE AUTHORIZES THIS COMMITTEE. TO PURSUE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STATE CAPITOL ANNEX OR THE RESTORATION REHABILITATION RENOVATION OR RECONSTRUCTION OF THE EXISTING STATE CAPITOL BUILDING ANNEX. WELL THE LAW USES THAT TERM CONTINUALLY I THINK THE DECISION HAS BEEN MADE TO CONSTRUCT A NEW CAPITOL ANNEX. THEREAFTER CHAPTER THIRTY ONE OF THE STATUES OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AT AN ARTICLE THAT RELATED GENERALLY TO STATE PROJECTS BUT EXEMPTED THE WORK TO BE DONE ON THE STATE CAPITOL. FROM THE DEFINITION OF THOSE PROJECTS HOWEVER OF IMPORTANCE IT THERE IS A SECTION THAT CREATES SOMETHING CALLED THE STATE PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE FUND AS A CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED FUND WHICH PROVIDES FOR A TRANSFER FROM THAT FUND TO THE OPERATING FUNDS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. THE ABOUT TO BE USE FOR THE PROJECTS SPECIFIED IN NINE ONE ONE TWO OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE. THE TRANSFER OCCURS UPON THE DIRECTION THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND THAT PARTICULAR CHAPTER THIRTY ONE AT THE TIME TRANSFERRED ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE FUND. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AB TWO SIX SIX SEVEN WAS SIGNED INTO LAW AND THAT BILL REQUIRES THAT ANY WORK UNDERTAKEN IN THE ANNEX DO THREE THINGS. FIRST IT INCORPORATES ELEMENTS COMPLIMENTARY TO THE HISTORIC STATE CAPITOL ELEMENTS TO MAKE THE STATE CAPITOL BUILDING AT NICK'S EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE AND HISTORIC ELEMENTS FROM THE EXISTING STATE CAPITOL BUILDING ANNEX. SECONDLY IT INTEGRATE DESIGN ELEMENTS IT EDUCATE AND IMPRESS UPON VISITORS THE RICH HERITAGE OF SYMBOLISM OF THIS HISTORIC STATE CAPITOL DESIGN. AND FINALLY INCORPORATE SYMBOLIC TREASURES. NO WE CAN TO THE TRAILER BILL THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY HAS REFERRED TO I'M AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX WAS ENACTED AS A TRAILER BILL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT AMENDED THE STATE CAPITOL BUILDING AN EXACT TO TWENTY SIXTEEN TO EXPAND THE AUTHORITY. TO INCLUDE A VISITOR CENTER AND AN EXPANDED AND RELOCATED UNDERGROUND PARKING FACILITY. THAT LEGISLATION AMONG OTHER THINGS PROVIDED FOR THE NEGOTIATION OF AGREEMENT AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THIS COMMITTEE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE CAPITOL ANNEX PROJECT. THE LEGISLATION AUTHORIZES IS TRANSFER OF MONEY TO FUND THE PROJECT AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT AND RECOGNITION OF THE PROJECT SCOPE. BUDGET DELIVERY METHOD AND SCHEDULE BY THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS FOR. LEGISLATION ALSO ALSO AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF LEASE REVENUE BONDS BUT THOSE LEASE REVENUE BONDS WERE VIEWED AS A BACK UP FOR FUNDING THE PROJECT. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PROVIDED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW STATE OFFICE BUILDING WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE SWING SPACE WHICH AS WE'VE MENTIONED WILL BE USED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATE CAPITOL ANNEX THE BILL APPROPRIATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THE COST OF THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT THAT WILL MODIFY PORTIONS OF THE WEST WING OF THE STATE CAPITOL IN ORDER TO FACILITATE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL STATE CAPITOL THE APPROPRIATION WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION TWENTY EIGHT OF ARTICLE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHICH RELATES TO APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE ALTERATION OR MODIFICATION OF ASPECTS OF THE HISTORICAL RESTORED. AREAS THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD FLOORS OF THE WEST WING OF THE CAPITOL. IN THE BUDGET ACTED TWENTY EIGHTEEN SIX HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS ADDED TO THE STATE PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE FUND. SO AFTER MANY MONTHS I THINK ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS OF NEGOTIATION. AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED UNDER THAT TRAILER BILL BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE DIRECTOR GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES WAS EXECUTED. ON NOVEMBER NINTH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE AGREEMENT WAS DESIGNATED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING AND WE COMMONLY CALL AT THE AMMO YOU. IT DELINEATES THE JURISDICTION OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE STATE CAPITOL ANNEX PROJECT AND THAT THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES OVER THE STATE OFFICE BUILDING. IT DOES CONTEMPLATE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AMONGST THE PARTIES PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE LEGISLATURE SPACE IN THE STATE OFFICE BUILDING. AND THE GOVERNOR IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SPACE IN THE NEW STATE CAPITOL ANTICS ANNEX. UNDER THE MO YOU THE COMMITTEE IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES IS TO PREPARE A PROJECT. OVERVIEW AND SEE THREE PORT WHICH WE CALL THE POS REPORT. WHAT'S THAT REPORT IS APPROVED BY ALL THE PARTIES TO THE ANIMAL YOU. YEAH BUT YOU WILL BE AMENDED TO INCORPORATE THE POS REPORT. AND AFTER THE REPORT IS AMENDED INTO THE MO YOU THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD MUST RECOGNIZE THE SCOPE BUDGET DELIVERY METHOD AND SCHEDULE FOR THE ANNEX PROJECT. THEREAFTER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE FUNDING. PROVIDED. IN THE TRAILER BILL WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE LEGISLATURE. THERE ARE YOU ALSO SET FORTH A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WHICH HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO IT ESTABLISHES THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHICH HAS THREE VOTING MEMBERS THOSE MEMBERS OF THE CHAIR OF THE J. RC. ON THE SENATE REPRESENTATIVE WHO SENATOR HERTZBERG AND THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS THERE ARE TWO NON VOTING MEMBERS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL SERVICES. AND ENTERS REPRESENTATIVE WHO IS MISTER HART AND MOCHA. THAT COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJOR DECISIONS FOR THE STATE CAPITOL ANNEX PROJECT INCLUDING ANY CHANGES IN SCOPE. IT MEETS MONTHLY AND IS SUBJECT TO MAJORITY VOTE THRESHOLD. YEAH WELL YOU HAS ANOTHER COMMITTEE WHICH IS THE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES DESIGNATED TO REPRESENT EACH HOUSE AND THEN THERE ARE TWO NON VOTING MEMBERS THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVE AND A REPRESENTATIVE SELECTED BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES WILL MAKE THE DAY TO DAY DECISIONS ON THE PROJECT TO DO NOT AMOUNT TO A CHANGE IN THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT. THEY HAVE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY SINCE THEY WERE FORMED. BOTH THE STATE OFFICE BUILDING AT THE STATE CAPITOL AND EXPOSURE TO WELL UNDER WAY MISTER HEARTS GOING TO DESCRIBE THOSE THE PROGRESS SHORT SHORTLY. WE DO HAVE ACTIVE PROCUREMENT ON THE PROJECT AFTER MEETING WITH VARIOUS LAW FIRMS THE OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HIRED NOT THAN OSMAN LAW FIRM TO ASSIST WITH ALL THE PROCUREMENTS. THEIR OUTSIDE COUNSEL BRINGS TO THEPROJECT AND EXPERTISE IN CONSTRUCTION LAW. MISTER HART WILL DESCRIBE THE SPECIFIC PROCUREMENTS BUT I WANT TO ALERT THE COMMITTEE THAT ANY PROCUREMENT DOCUMENT THAT WE PREPARE WILL PROHIBIT PROPOSERS FROM HAVING EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS WITH ANY OF YOU. SO I'D ASK YOU TO REFRAIN FROM SPEAKING ABOUT THE PROJECT WITH CONTRACTS CONTRACTORS ARCHITECTS ENGINEERS AND LOBBYISTS WHO REPRESENT THOSE GROUPS TO DATE THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS RELATED TO THE PROCUREMENT FOR THE CAPITOL VISITOR WELCOME CENTER. OUR PLANT CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION AND I'M GOING TO NOT GET THIS NAME PROPERLY BEFORE YOU BUT MARK. HAVE AG NARROW ASSOCIATES AND C. S. H. Q. A. AS THE ARCHITECTURAL FIRMS TURNER CONSTRUCTION WITH H. G. A. AS THE ARCHITECTURAL FIRM AND HENSEL PHELPS WITH DREYFUS BLACKFORD IN H. OKAY AS THE ARCHITECTURAL FIRMS. WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH EACH REQUIREMENT INFORMATION WITH PROCUREMENT INFORMATION FOR PURPOSES OF THE PROHIBITION SO YOU KNOW WHO YOU SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T TALK TO ABOUT THE PROJECT. IT'S BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO WORK ON THE PROJECT I'M. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE TURNING IT OVER TO MR HARD. ANY QUESTIONS FOR. HARLEM SHAKE. I DO WANT TO SAY THE OUTSIDE FROM THE NORSEMAN FIRM OF THESE ERRORS PRECIOUS OUT OF LA THEY HAVE A CONSTRUCTION LAW PRACTICE THEY'VE BEEN VERY INDISPENSABLE HELPLESS SO WITH STRICT TURNAROUNDS AND WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED YOUR LAWYERS VERY FEARLESS TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY THINK AND IF THEY SEE SOMETHING I THINK IS AN ISSUE. OR NOT BASHFUL ABOUT SERVICING IT. SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GO THIS GETS INTO DRAFTING AND- YOU KNOW. I HAVE FOUND THEM VERY VERY VALUABLE ON OUR BEHALF I'VE ALWAYS FELT. THIS IS A PROJECT WILL CONDUCTED IN PUBLIC FISH BOWL WE NEED TO WE NEED TO DO IT. IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER AT EVERY TURN AND TO AVOID FALL IN AND IN A MANNER DISREPUTE. AND SO I THINK THE NOT SPENT FIRMS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB TO ASSIST US SO I'M FOR A PREVIEW OF THEIR- ROLE. OUR ANY ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTION OR ANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR LIVES HAVE COUNSEL. ALL RIGHT THEN AT THAT TIME I WILL ASK MISTER DAVID HEART HE IS WITH THE SALT LAKE CITY. UTAH BASED FIRM KNOWN AS MOCHA. BUT IN THIS VERY SPECIALIZED NECK NATURE OF ASSISTING. STATE GOVERNMENTS AROUND OUR COUNTRY DEAL WITH AGING BUILDINGS AND AS I SAY WE WENT. WE WENT TO A PROCESS WHERE HE APPEARED. TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF A STATE CAPITOL REBUILD PROCESS BACK IN JULY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. WITHIN ACTUALLY FELT. PLEASE WITH THE FOUR WORK WE SAW THERE WE RETAIN GET FOR SOME ASSISTANCE IN SOME OF OUR EARLY PROCESS THEN AND SO TO ACTUALLY DECIDE RICK RECRUITED TO BE OUR OWNERS REPRESENT WAS SORT OF THE THIRD. STEP IN OUR RELATIONSHIP MISTER HART SO MR HARD IF YOU WILL PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE WITH REGARDS TO THE REBUILD OF THE ANNEX AND THE VISITOR CENTER AND- ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT. FIRST OF ALL WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS KIND OF WALK THROUGH A AN AGENDA OF THE THINGS THAT I'LL BE COVERING THE FIRST THING I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IS THE OVERVIEW OF THE ANNEX PROJECTS. YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE THAT THE VISITOR CENTER GOAL IS TO HAVE IT COMPLETE BY THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE PARKING STRUCTURE AND THE ANNEX REPLACEMENT WE'RE PLANNING TO HAVE DONE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE WILL THEN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VISITOR CENTER WORKSHOP THAT WE'VE HELD RECENTLY. WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE UPCOMING PROCUREMENTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT A LITTLE BIT WILL GO INTO A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON THOSE WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SWING SPACE. AND THEN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION MISTER COOLEY STAFF ALONG WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS WORKING WITHIN THE STATE AND ON OUR OUR TEAM HAVE PUT TOGETHER SOME VERY GOOD SOCIAL MEDIA INFORMATION AND- IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANNEX. AS MENTIONED WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER A PROJECT OVERVIEW IN SEQUENCE REPORT IN THIS DOCUMENT IT LAYS OUT AND ORGANIZES THE APPROACH AND THE SEQUENCE TO HOW THE WORK IS GOING TO BE DONE. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WE GO YEAR BY YEAR AND TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT ASPECTS WITHIN THAT REPORT WE POINT OUT THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS AND ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT SO THE AREA THAT YOU SEE HERE AND PINK. IS THE LOCATION THAT WE ARE PLANNING TO PUT THE VISITOR CENTER THE VISITORS CENTER WILL BE BELOW GRADE WHEN YOU STAND ON THE MALL AND YOU LOOK BACK AT THE CAPITOL YOU WON'T SEE ANY OF IT. WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE VIEW WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE TREES AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO HI THE FACILITY YET STILL ALLOW FOR THE FACILITY TO BE A OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL PEOPLE TO COME TO THE CAPITAL AND EXPERIENCE THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH CALIFORNIA AND THE WORK. THAT IS DONE HERE. THE ANNEX. OF COURSE WILL BE REMOVED AND THEN REPLACED. WE SEE THAT SITTING APPROXIMATELY IN THE LOCATION IDENTIFIED BY THE BLUE SQUARE. AND THEN A PARKING STRUCTURE IS MISTER HERTZBERG SENATOR HERTZBERG IS INDICATED WILL BE LOCATED TO THE- SOUTH. WE ARE LOOKING AT CURRENTLY TO SCHEMES FOR THE PARKING STRUCTURE ONE IS A TWO LEVEL BELOW GRADE PARKING STRUCTURE. THAT WOULD BE MORE OR LESS A TYPICAL PARKING FACILITY AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE ONE THAT. HE ALLUDED TO WHICH MIGHT BE A HIGHER FLOOR. ONLY ONE LEVEL BELOW GRADE AND MAY ALLOW FOR FUTURE FLEXIBILITY IN THAT WE MAY SEE A REDUCTION AND AUTOMOBILES ARE CHANGING PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION. THESE THREE PROJECTS REALLY COMPRISE THE OVERALL PROJECT THAT WE REFER TO AS THE ANNEX PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO THE SEQUENCE REPORT THAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER WE HAVE ALSO PUT TOGETHER SET OF DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR THE VISITOR CENTER WITHIN THOSE GUIDELINES THESE ARE HIGH ASPIRATIONAL GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT BY BOTH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IN THE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES AND OTHERS. THE TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE WITHIN THE PROJECT SOME OF THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED TODAY BY SENATOR MORNING WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT EIGHTY A SECURITY MAKING SURE IT'S WELCOME OF THE PEOPLE CAN COME IN THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF ELEMENTS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME GUIDING PRINCIPLES THAT WE. ARE HOLDING UP VERY HIGH AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACCOMPLISH FIRST IS INCLUSIVE AND WELCOMING FOR THE VISITOR CENTER. WE ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO BRING PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THIS IS PART OF THEIRS. WE HAD A CONVERSATION WHILE WE WERE GOING THROUGH THIS AND SOMEBODY MENTIONED I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO IT WAS THAT. THEY KNEW SOMEBODY WHO FELT. LIKE THEY COULDN'T COME IN TO THE BUILDING. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY EVERYBODY FEELS LIKE THEY CAN COME IN REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE OR WHAT CONDITION THERE IN THAT THE BUILDING IS WELCOMING IT BRINGS THEM AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO. VISIT WITH MEMBERS AND TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. FUNCTIONAL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VISITOR CENTER IS ALSO FUNCTIONALLY RECOGNIZE IT IS GOING TO BE THE FRONT DOOR OF THE BUILDING. FOR THE NEXT THE FIVE YEARS UNTIL THE ANNEXES REPLACED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME IN AND MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH IT IF THEY WANT TO GO THROUGH THE EXHIBITS AND THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH THOSE BUT IF THEY NEED TO MOVE INTO THE CAPITAL. TO COME UP AND VISIT WITH ONE OF YOU OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A HEARING. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THEN SAFE SECURE ACCESS. DAYS TODAY WHERE WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES ARISE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE AS THEY COME INTO THE BUILDING NOT ONLY FILL. WELCOME AND INCLUDED BUT THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE. AND THAT THEY CAN TAKE TIME AND RELAX AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. SO MISTER COOLEY MENTION THAT WE HAD RECENTLY HELD A- VISITOR CENTER WORKSHOP. WE PULL TOGETHER SEVERAL. INDIVIDUALS FROM BOTH WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT. THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT MISTER COOLIES OFFICE INVITED TO COME IN THAT WERE EDUCATORS. AND ALIKE AS WELL AS CONSULTANTS. AND WE ASSEMBLED A GROUP OF PEOLE WE TALKED ABOUT THE THINGS THAT NEEDED TO OCCUR WITHIN THE VISITOR CENTER. AND OUT OF THAT CAME THIS BLUE BOOK THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SEEN THAT HAS BEEN. HANDED OUT TO EACH ONE OF YOU. AND IT GOES THROUGH AND IT GIVES A VERY GOOD DETAILED DISCUSSION. OF WHAT ELEMENTS SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN SHOULD BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE- VISITOR CENTER. THE OTHER THING THAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT WE HAVE NOW PROVIDED THAT BOOK TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCUREMENTS. SO THEY HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT IT IS THE- BODY IS LOOKING FOR AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH A SELECTION PROCESS. WITHIN THAT WE IDENTIFIED A FLOW AND CIRCULATION THAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE VISITOR CENTER FROM THE TIME THEY COME INTO THE BUILDING. TO HOW THEY MOVE THROUGH THE SPACE HOW THEY GO THROUGH SECURITY HOW THEY MOVE INTO THE EXHIBIT AREAS AND HOW THEY MOVE FROM THE EXHIBIT AREAS. EITHER INTO A SPECIALIZED ROOM OR SOME TYPE OF TRAINING FACILITY. AND ON UP INTO THE CAPITAL PROPER ITSELF AND THEN INTO THE REST OF THE FACILITY. WE HAVE THEN TRIED TO DIAGRAM THAT IN A GRAPHIC FORMAT THAT YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE AS AS PEOPLE COME INTO THE WELCOMING. AND ASSEMBLY AREA THEY WOULD ASSEMBLE THERE AND THEN MOVE INTO THE VISITOR AND WELCOME CENTER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO REALLY TRY TO ACCOMPLISH IS TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO Q. PRIOR TO GOING THROUGH SECURITY IN A DRY COMFORTABLE SPACE. WHERE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED TO THEM RATHER THAN HAVING THEM STAND OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN. WITH UMBRELLAS WAITING TO GET IN TO THE BUILDING. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE BELIEVE. THE EXHIBIT DESIGNERS WILL MOVE THROUGH AND IT IS BEEN ALIGNED WITH THE DESIGN PROCESS THAT THE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILDERS WILL USE. AS THEY PUT TOGETHER THE BUILDING AND SO WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. IN THE PROJECT DEFINITION WHICH IS USUALLY THE FIRST PHASE THAT THE DESIGNERS WILL GO THROUGH. THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE AUDIENCE AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO FOCUS. THE VISITOR CENTER ON THE AUDIENCE AND WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE MESSAGES WE WANT TO SEND. SCHEMATIC DESIGN THE VISITOR CENTER WILL FOCUS ON THEMING AND STORY LINE. WITHIN THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT THEY WILL LOOK AT THE PRESENTATIONSAND HOW THOSE WILL BE INCORPORATED. ALSO AT THIS POINT WE WILL WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE PROGRESSIVE DIVIDE DESIGN BUILD TEAMS. TO DETERMINE WHAT PORTIONS OF THE EXHIBIT FURNITURE OR THE EXHIBIT CABINET TREE. WILL BE BECOME PART OF THE DESIGN BUILD OR WILL BECOME PART OF THE- PROCUREMENT FOR EXHIBIT MATERIALS. THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT'S ALWAYS LESS EXPENSIVE TO HAVE A CONTRACTOR PROVIDE THOSE RATHER THAN GO OUT. AND DO A SEPARATE PROCUREMENT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS WE CAN. SAVE MONEY AND STILL PROVIDE A VERY HIGH CAPITAL QUALITY. XIN ASPECTS OF THE EXHIBIT. AS MENTIONED WE ARE IN A PERIOD OF ACTIVE PROCUREMENT. PRESENTLY WITH THE EXHIBIT DESIGNERS WE HAVE. RECEIVED A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS WE ARE GOING THROUGH THOSE PROPOSALS. AND WILL BE A SHORT LISTING THOSE WE ANTICIPATE NEXT WEEK IN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. IN REGARDS TO THE PROCUREMENTS AS WAS MENTIONED WE HAVE THE VISITOR CENTER PROCUREMENT FOR THE TO PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD TEAMS WE HAVE SHORTLISTED THE TEAMS AS OF JULY THIRTY FIRST WE WILL DO THE SELECTION. ON SEPTEMBER WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE THE SELECTION ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH AND THEN WE ARE LOOKING FOR THEM TO BEGIN WORK AROUND OCTOBER ELEVENTH WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT EARLIER FOR ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE CONTRACTING. THE PROPOSALS FOR THE EXHIBIT DESIGNER HAVE BEEN RECEIVED WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THOSE WE WILL BE SHORT LISTING AND THEN GOING THROUGH A SELECTION AND WE HOPE TO MAKE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AGAIN AROUND THE SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH AND THEN BEGAN WORK ON THE ELEVENTH. YOU WILL NOTE THAT WE HAVE TRIED TO ALIGN THESE TO PROCUREMENT SO THAT BOTH THE S. OF THIS BILL. THE DESIGNER SELECTION WILL OCCUR AT THE SAME TIME SO THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER. AND THAT THEY CAN THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BUILD OFF OF ONE ANOTHER. WE ALSO HAVE SOME UPCOMING PROCUREMENTS. THE FIRST WILL BE FOR THE ANNEX ARCHITECT AND ENGINEER WE ARE PURSUING THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED A CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK PROGRAM. WHERE THE OWNER WILL HOLD BOTH THE CONTRACT FOR THE ARCHITECT AND ENGINEER AND THEY WILL HOLD THE CONTRACT FOR THE CONTRACTOR. WE WILL BRING ON THE ARCHITECT HAVE THE SHORTLIST WILL PUT OUT THE R. F. P. SHORTLY AND HAVE THE SHORTLIST AROUND OF THE FOURTEENTH OF NOVEMBER. SELECTION BY THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY AND THEN BEGAN WORK IN IN MARCH. LIKEWISE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK WE WILL FOLLOW A LITTLE BIT WE WILL START TO ACTUALLY WITH THE SHORT LIST AHEAD OF THE ARCHITECT AROUND NOVEMBER FOURTH. AND THEN IT'S A LITTLE LONGER PROCESS FOR THE CONTRACTOR WE WILL THEN HAVE THE SELECTION BY THE END OF JANUARY. AGAIN HOPE TO START AROUND THE FIRST PART OF MARCH. THE SWING SPACE HAS AS YOU CAN SEE BY THE PICTURE WE HAD A GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY. AND I THINK YOU CAN SEE THIS IS REALLY A LOT OF IF NOT ALL OF YOUR TEAM MEMBERS. AND THEY HAD A LOT OF FUN ON OCTOBER FIFTEENTH AT THE GROUND BREAKING THE BUILDING IS MOVING UP YOU CAN START TO SEE THAT THERE ARE TWO CRANES UP AS CHAIRMAN COOLEY. ALLUDED TO AND IT'S A LOT OF FUN SEEING THAT GOING UP AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE PARTNERING WITH D. G. S. ON THIS PROJECT THAT THEY ARE LEADING IN AND WE ARE PROVIDING SOME. REVIEW OF IT SHOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS THE CENTER OF THE BUILDING WILL BE OPEN AND HAVE MULTIPLE ATRIUMS. AND SHOULD BE A VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL BUILDING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IS WE'VE DONE A RE BRANDING. OF THE WEBSITE. YOU CAN NOW SEE THAT THE WEBSITE IS UP AND WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO LOOK AT IT THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PLACES AND THINGS THAT YOU CAN SEE THERE FROM JUST GAINING SOME INFORMATION AND WE'RE ALSO USING THIS TO DISTRIBUTE. THE INFORMATION TO THE CONTRACTORS AND TO THE INTERESTED ARCHITECTS. THE NEW DESIGN IS VERY EASY TO USE AND IT I THINK BRINGS THE- PROJECT LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION AND PROFESSIONALISM THAT IT REALLY DESERVES. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE HAD SOME NEWS RELEASES THAT MR COOLEY IS PUT OUT THROUGH HIS STAFF AND THEN. HIS STAFF IS ALSO BEEN WORKING A LOT WITH PUTTING INFORMATION OUT TO THE STAFF AND THE AND THE DIFFERENT FOLKS WITHIN THE ANNEX BUILDING PROPER SO. WE'RE TRYING TO DO ALL WE CAN TO COMMUNICATE THE WORK THAT IS GOING FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS INFORMED IN. AND UP TO. SPEED ON ON THE PROGRESS. FINALLY WHERE WE ARE PRESENTLY AS WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER THE ANNEX BUILDING GUIDELINES THESE ARE SIMILAR TO THE VISITOR CENTER GUIDELINES AND THAT THEY WILL BE. AGAIN THINGS THAT WE CARE THE MOST ABOUT AND WE WANT TO TRANSMIT TO THE ARCHITECTS. THEY WILL BE COMING TOGETHER IN THOSE WILL BE READY IN ABOUT ANOTHER MONTH OR SO. SO THAT THE THEY CAN BE READY TO GO WITH THE PROCUREMENT. AS PART OF THE WORK ON THE ANNEX WE HAVE SPENT. A LOT OF TIME. LOOKING AT THE WORK THAT WAS DONE PREVIOUSLY BY THE ARCHITECTURAL FIRM THAT DEVELOPED THE BLUE BOOK. THEY PROVIDED US WITH WHAT'S CALLED A SPACE PROGRAM WHICH BASICALLY LAYS OUT THE AMOUNT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT EACH OFFICER OR FACILITY OR FUNCTION WITHIN THE BUILDING WILL. WILL HAVE WE'VE GONE BACK THROUGH THAT ANALYZE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT A FACILITY FOR THE ANNEX OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. VISITORS CENTER IS APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND SQUARE FEET AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARKING STALLS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT DOING A BUILDING THAT IS. SUSTAINABLE WE ARE LOOKING AT LEAD RE USE OF EXISTING MATERIALS THAT ARE WITHIN THE BUILDING. AND WE WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WOOD THAT HAS BEEN HARVESTED OR WHEN IT FELL. DURING A STORM WE HAVE HOLD HELD ON TO THAT AND SO WE HAVE USED THE WORD FROM THE CIVIL WAR TREES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS ABLE TO BE USED IN. AND PRESENTED WITHIN THE BUILDING. WE'RE LOOKING AT NET ZERO ENERGY WE'D LIKE TO MOVE TOWARDS A LOW CARBON AND ELECTRIFICATION OF BUILDINGS. INCLUDING DAYLIGHT HARVESTING NATURAL LIGHTING VIEWS AND WHERE WE CAN WE WOULD LIKE TO USE GRAY WATER WE USE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BUILDING SHOULD BE AS MR COOLEY SAYS ONE OF THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CAPITOL. BUILDINGS IN THE NATION AND WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE STUDYING AND WILL BE WORKING ON OVER THE NEXT LITTLE BIT IS. WHAT FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE CURRENT ANNEX NEED TO MOVE INTO THE WEST WING AS WE- VACATE THE ADDICTS AND MOVED IN TO THE TENTH AND SWING SPACE. THAT WAY WE CAN KEEP THE- LEGISLATURE IN YOUR FUNCTIONS GOING WITHIN THE WEST WING WHILE YOU ARE LIVING IN THE TEMPORAL BUILDING. SO WE ARE IDENTIFYING THOSE THINGS WERE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SPACE FOR THAT. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SPACE OR MAKE SURE THAT LEADERSHIP IS STILL AVAILABLE TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO WITH IN THE WEST WING AS WELL SO. IT'S KIND OF A COMPLICATED. GAME OF. MOVING PIECES AROUND BUT I THINK THAT'S COMING TOGETHER IF I MAY JUST JUMP IN ON THE SLIDE SO THE- THE BOTTOM LINE IS. OUR CHAMBERS. ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED BY TURKS OFFICES SERGEANTS OFFICES AND **** IN SPACES. ALL OF WHICH ARE IN THE ANNEX PORTION. OF THE BUILDING. SO THIS CHART IS ACTUALLY DEPICTING THIS IDEA. THAT WHILE SPACE WILL BE RETAINED IN THE LEADERSHIP SWEETS RIGHT OFF THE CHAMBERS. ON THE OUTER WALL OF THE BUILDING NORTH AND SOUTH. CENTRAL PORTIONS WILL BE REPURPOSE PROVIDE COXON SPACES ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THE CHAMBERS. SO THAT IF WE'RE IN SESSION WE'RE GOOD IF WE NEED TO RETREAT TO CAUCUSES OF THE SPACE PROVIDED CONVENE IT TO THE FLOOR. AND SO THAT'S PART OF MAKING SURE THAT THE HISTORIC CAPITAL REMAINS THE WORKING CAPITAL NOT A MUSEUM OUR SESSIONS WILL CONTINUE AND SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY IMPORTANT SLIDE IN TERMS OF JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW WILL MAKE THE BUILDING WORK. AND THESE WERE REPRESENT. TEMPORARY CHAMBERS BUT ON THE CONSTITUTION THEY ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A SEPARATE APPROPRIATION PAY FOR THEM SO THAT'S WHAT TIME FOR WINE WAS REVIEWING SEEN ADDED TWENTY MILLION APPROPRIATION UNDER THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT WAS MADE IN THE CONSCIOUS FOR PRO REQUISITES FOR TOUCHING THE WEST WING A BROWN TEMPORARY BASIS AND AS YOU COME TO WE'RE GOING TO TURN A HOLLY MITCHELL IN A MINUTE FOR THE FIRST QUESTIONS BUT PLEASE CALL CAN YOU I'M NOT TELLING THAT'S GOING TO STATE SHE'S UP FIRST THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO MOVING ON THE THIS IS A GRAPHIC THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS ALIGN THE FLOORS AS YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST SO MANY YEARS SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY TWO IN THE BUILDING WAS BUILT THERE WAS NO ALIGNMENT OF THE FLOORS REALLY TO SPEAK OF SO ONE OF THE GOALS IS TO ALIGN THE FLOORS AND YOU CAN SEE THE APPROXIMATE MASS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING. AT WAYS TO REDUCE THAT MASS. AND TRY TO STE. ALL OF THE- ASPECTS. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH AND TRIED TO DO A VERY DETAILED STUDY OF THE BUDGET AS BEST WE CAN AT THIS POINT IN TIME TRYING TO ESTIMATOR GUESSTIMATE. THOSE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR. AND TRY TO FUND. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE A BUDGET MODEL THAT IS IN BUDGET AND WE'RE I THINK WE'RE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO SCHEDULE WE HAVE BUILT A SCHEDULE THAT WE ARE USING TO GUIDE OUR DIRECTION. WITH REGARDS TO HOW WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME WITH REGARDS TO THAT WE ARE SITTING ON SCHEDULE. AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. AND SO WITH THAT I WILL BE HAPPY TO. ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER HART THIS SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE IT. FIRST OF ALL DO A VERY BRIEF STATEMENT I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE CONCERT WITH THE VISITOR CENTER AS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER TO NCSL I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IN RECENT YEARS TO TRAVEL TO A NUMBER OF OUR STATE CAPITALS IN A NUMBER OF THEM THAT HAVE DONE. HAD RESET CERTAINLY MORE RECENT THAN OURS CONSTRUCTION HAVE THESE VISITOR CENTERS AND THEY'RE JUST WONDERFUL MODELS TO SEE SO I THINK THAT WILL BUILD VERY WELL FOR OUR STATE NOW AS MR HERTZBERG SAID HIS OPENING REMARKS THAT THE UNIQUE CHALLENGE BEFORE US TO BUILD AND CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRUCT AND IMAGINE SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE I THINK THAT SPACE. MAKES SENSE SINCE I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. ON TO MY QUESTION I'M NOT SURE. IF IT'S MOST APPROPRIATE FOR YOU MISTER HART OR YOU MISS PLAYER VINE. BUT IT DEALS WITH THE ISSUE OF PROCUREMENT. AND GIVEN THE SITES. AND SCOPE SIZE AS IN. THE MONETARY SIDE HACE. OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND THE SIGNIFICANCE THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. I AM HOPING THAT IN OUR PROCUREMENT PROCESS WE'RE LOOKING AT. CALIFORNIA BASED FIRMS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT'S THE CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND I'M ALSO HOPING THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME TARGETED OUTREACH TO WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED FIRMS. REALLY WITH MIKE MICHAEL BEING THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HOPEFULLY THE SERVICE PRINCIPLES AND NOT JUST US UP. AND SO IF THERE'S BEEN TARGET OUT REACH AND IF WE'RE LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA BASED FIRMS EXCLUSIVELY SO MISTER HART CAN CONFIRM THIS BUT I BELIEVE IN OUR- OUR OUR BIGGEST PROCUREMENT SO FAR IS THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER. THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN OFFICE BASED IN CALIFORNIA WAS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A THEY MUST HAVE A CALIFORNIA LICENSE. AND THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO HAVE A OFFICE SPACE IN SACRAMENTO. THE IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY ARE CALIFORNIA FIRM STATUS WILL THAT IS. OFFICE OKAY. THE ISSUE OF MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED ENTERPRISES IS COMPLICATED. BECAUSE JUST YOU UNDERSTAND PROP TWO OH NINE PROHIBITS. PROCUREMENT THAT ARE TARGETED TOWARD THEM IT DOESN'T FOR CARE PROHIBITS OUT OF REACH ON A DOZEN PROHIBITS TARGETED OUT REACH WHEN I THINK TARGETED OUT REACH I MEAN IT EIGHT A PROACTIVE EFFORT TO FIND AND IDENTIFY SO WHAT WE ARE DOING WE HAVE A COUPLE THINGS GOING ON WORK WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISES AND DISABLED THAT. AND USING SOME OF THE FORMS HOPEFULLY THAT WE'VE TALKED WITH DTS BUT USING SOME OF THEIR OUTRAGE MECHANISMS AND MY GET HOPE WOULD BE THAT WITHIN THOSE WE WOULD GET TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THAT THE OUTREACH EFFORTS THEY HAVE MIGHT HAVE. MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED ENTERPRISES. SO THAT'S THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING WITH RESPECT TO THOSE THAT REJECT BIRDS. AND AGAIN I JUST BUT I GUESS MY POINT BEING GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS INVESTMENT. AND THE HISTORICAL RELEVANCE HISTORIC RELEVANCE OF BUILDING A NEW STATE CAPITOL BUT I HOPE THAT WE WOULD REALLY TRY TO COMPLY WITH. THE SPIRIT OF THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF OUR PUBLIC INVESTMENT. AND SO IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN CONNECT WITH NOVEL ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS TO. BREAKING THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO YOUR ATTENTION I CERTAINLY WILL DO SO I YOU KNOW I'M APPRECIATE. THE CONFINES OF PROP TWO OH NINE AND I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT IT LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO PRIORITIZE OR GIVE RIGHT PRIORITY TO. BUT AGAIN IN TERMS OF MY EXPECTATION AROUND ERNEST OUT OF REACH TO WOMEN AND MINORITY EARN. MINORITY OWNED FIRMS I THINK IT CAN BE DONE EVEN WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE LAN SO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND OF THE ETHNIC CAUCUSES TO TAP INTO OUR NETWORKS TO REALLY TRY TO HELP FACILITATE THAT. WE CAN ABSOLUTELY. WE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BURGER CENTER HERTZBERG. HE'S NOT SURE WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS. JUST BRIEFLY THANK YOU OF A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THAT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING IN IN TRYING TO DESIGN THIS. WHAT THE FUTURE IS SENATE MITCHELL INCORPORATED BUT ALSO HAVE SOME CONVENIENCES THAT UNDERSTAND. THE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES UNIQUE TO THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE OFTEN IT TERMS OF REDESIGNING WHEN PEOPLE LINED UP RIGHT HOW MANY MAGNETOMETERS ARE THERE. HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE IN TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF WE HAVE BIG DAYS WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF BILLS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE INTERESTED AND EXERCISING THEIR VOICE AND WORKING WITH. OUR OWN SECURITY FOLKS IN TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT RIGHT SOME OF THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE NOW IS WE HAVE SIXTEEN ASSEMBLY OFFICE COMMITTEE STAFFS. COMMITTEE OFFICES IN THE L. O. B. AND WE'VE GOT A NUMBER STAFF BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY MOSTLY THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. BUT LIKE WHAT ABOUT THE TRAFFIC BACK AND FORTH RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL BUT IF YOU OF THE THAT SWING SPACE THAT NOW HAS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. BOOK EVERYTHING IT'S IN THIS SITE ALTHOUGH IT LEGISLATIVE OFFICES ALL OVER STAFFS. IT WILL REDUCE IT WILL REPRODUCE THIS COMMITTEE ROOM AND THE YOUR BACK BUDGET COMMITTEE ROOM ACROSS. AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MUCH MOVEMENT AT ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS COMMITTEES AND THEN YOU GOT TO THINK THROUGH THE CAR JUST TO KIND ISSUE SPOT FOR EVERYBODY. YOU GOT COMMITTEES OVER HERE IN THE OLD PART AND THEN YOU GOT COMMITTEES OVER THERE IN THE NEW PARK HOW DO YOU GET BACK AND FORTH SO QUICKLY IN TERMS OF MEMBERS. YOU OF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT A CAUCUSES OR YOU'LL HAVE SESSION THAT MOVE. IS GOING TO BE DRAMATICALLY MORE GREATER THAN MOVES THAT HAVE NOW IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THAT SO DEALING WITH TRAFFIC WE'RE TALKING TO THE CITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING AT SOME OF THE STREETS OF THESE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE. BUT IT WILL THE POINT OF TAKING A MOMENT. TO TRY. TO SHARE WITH THE- MEMBERS OF THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE. IS THAT THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS ARE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH. AND REALLY GET THE DAY TO DAY EXPERIENCES AND WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE AND THE NEEDS OF. THE COMMUNITY WHEN THEY COME UP AND THEY WANT TO HAVE A VOICE IN WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE. AND THE HALLWAYS AND HOW WIDE THEY ARE WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WITH THEIR LINE UP BECAUSE THERE'S A BIG PARTICULAR ISSUE OF WHATEVER THAT ISSUES OF THE DAY. HOW DOES THAT STUFF WORKS A LOT OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IN ADDITION TO THE CONSTRUCTION ISSUES AND KIND OF THE NORMAL ISSUES. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO. ARE ALL IN YOUR CHECKED. INTO THE LARGER DISCUSSION THAT HAS THAT PRACTICAL AS ANY OF THE THOUGHT YOU'VE GOT. IT'S HARD TO THINK IN THROUGH ALL THIS STUFF SO. THE JUST TO SHARE OF SOME SOME ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS WE'VE BEEN GOING FORWARD ON THIS. TO TRY TO LOOK AT THE PRACTICAL WITH EVERYBODY FROM SECURITY EVERY OTHER ISSUE. ON THE DAY WERE LITERALLY COUNTING ON THOSE BIG DAIS GERMAN COULD. YOU TO. HEY I'M THOSE BIG BASS THE SERGEANTS OF COUNT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WALK THROUGH. AND WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE TO HELP INFORM. BECAUSE THOSE ARE GOING TO BE ISSUES THAT ARE ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND IN THIS PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. STUFF WORKS AT THE BACK AND FORTH IS GONNA BE QUITE CHALLENGING. WE'RE GONNA JUMP TO MISTER MOM. MONNING AND THEN MITCHELL I WANT TO JUST SAY. ON THIS ONE ONE ISSUE THAT YOU RAISE WHICH IS DEFINITELY ONE. WE HAVE DONE A LOT TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THE PROJECT WE'VE HAD THE WEBSITE UP FOR TWENTY EIGHT MONTHS CONTINUOUSLY. MISTER MOKO OR MISTER HART AND LOCAL ONE HIS PRIORITIES HAS BEEN A RECENTLY CONDUCTED INDUSTRY DAY. THAT WAS IN THIS HERE THIS ROOM WAS PACKED OUT THE ROOM PUBLICIZE WHAT'S GOING ON. I AM CERTAINLY BEEN SORT OF. A NOT ON THE ISSUE FRANKLY TALKING THEN ONE ONE YOU KNOW WASN'T MOVING ABOUT THE PROJECT SO NOW IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS I AM BEING MORE RESTRAINED. ABOUT WHO I TALKED TO JUST BECAUSE I NEVER WANT TO BRING DISCREDIT TO THE PROCESS. BUT WE'VE DONE INDUSTRY DAYS WE MADE A DECISION ON THIS PROCESS ALTHOUGH PROCUREMENT IS AVAILABLE ON THE LEGISLATURE'S WEBSITE WE ALSO. ANNOUNCES TO THE TGS WEBSITE SO ANYBODY WHO IN THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES FALL WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA THINGS WOULD LEARN ABOUT THIS PROJECT EVEN IF THEY DON'T FIND OUR WEBSITE. BECAUSE IT'S ECHOED ON THE TGS WEBSITE. SO I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY ANY. I PURSUED ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT IT OPPORTUNITIES HERE I'M- NOT LOOKING TO PUT MY HAND ON THE SCALE IN TERMS OF HOW WE SORT THINGS OUT. OPEN TO THE SORT OF FOLKS WE WOULD WOULD HAVE HERE. BUT I THINK WE HAVE DEFINITELY MADE EFFORTS TO KIND OF MAKE SURE WE OR PUBLICIZING. WHAT'S GOING ON BUT SO NAY BORE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS VERY APT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THAT WOULD BE REACH OUT. MAKE SURE THEY'VE SEEN IT MISTER MONEY IN THE MISS MITCHELL. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK MISTER HURT FOR THE PRESENTATION AND THE WORK THAT THE MARK OF LOCUSTS DOING ON THIS. I'M PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO SEE THERE'LL BE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE FLOORS. OF THE ANNEX I'VE BEEN HERE TEN AND A HALF YEARS I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT SO THAT WILL BE A GREAT ASSET TO THOSE OF US WHO WORK HERE IN FOR VISITORS. ON A MORE SERIOUS. ISSUE PRESENTED THE VISITOR CENTER CONCEPT. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD BE DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT BEFORE GOING THROUGH. SECURITY CHECK. DOES THAT CREATE ANY PROBLEMS FOR THE SECURITY WITHIN THE VISITOR CENTER. MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE'D HAVE NOT SAT DOWN WITH SECURITY GONE THROUGH IN DETAIL SOME OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY HAVE SOME CONCERNS OVER THAT. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN AND LISTEN TO AND THEN TRY TO ADDRESS WE THINK THAT OF COURSE SECURITY IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BECAUSE IT'S A FACILITY THAT IS. BELOW GRADE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF QUEUING TAKING PLACE ON STAIRS OR OUT IN THE WEATHER AND SO WE WANT TO TRY TO FIND A HAPPY BALANCE SO TO SPEAK BETWEEN THE TWO. THANKS AND AGAIN I KNOW. I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT OUR SECURITY PEOPLE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS FROM DAY ONE IN RAISING THEIR QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND- THIS MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR OUR OVERVIEW TODAY BUT JUST THE BROAD CONCEPT OF. EVACUATIONS IN SEALING OFF CERTAIN AREAS HAS THAT BEEN A CONSIDERATION IN THE DESIGN CONCEPTS WE HAVE. TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN INTO ANY OF IT AT THIS POINT. BUT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT AREAS OF REFUGE AND- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- HAVE SEEMS LIKE IN THE DESIGN. WOULD CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THAT'S RIGHT PROTECT LARGE AREAS IF SOMETHING'S GOING ON IN RIGHT THERE AND WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE FIRE MARSHAL AND OTHER PEOPLE TO KIND OF HELP WORK THROUGH THAT. GREAT THANKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF I COULD. COMMENT FIRST AND THANK YOU SENATOR MINING AS THIRD HERTZBERG TALK ABOUT THE MANY CHALLENGES OF THIS DESIGN BOTH THE TEMPORARY AND THE PERMANENT I'VE RAISING THE PASS AND DON'T WANT LOS THAT. THAT IN THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION IS IT HAS TO DO WE HAVE TO BE FOR EVER MINDFUL OF THE SHEER NUMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC WERE HERE EVERY DAY. AND HAVE THE- PHYSICAL STRUCTURE ABILITY TO EVACUATE THEM IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY OF ANY TIME. IF YOU THINK ABOUT ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS A YEAR THAT FORTY TWO ALL THREE FORTY TWO OR THREE. ARE AT CAPACITY COUPLED WITH. EMPLOYEES AND JUST YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF BODIES IN THE SHEER HALLS I'VE IN THE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS COMMITTEE. WHETHER OR NOT WE LITERALLY HAVE ENOUGH EXITS AND STAIR WELLS TO FOR PEOPLE TO ACCEPT PROPERLY SO AS YOU'RE DEALING WITH ALL OF THAT. THE SAFETY ELEMENT I'M HOPING IS INCLUDED. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN. AGAIN I WOULD JUST ADD AND I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE FROM MISTER HART I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE WHO. YOU KNOW AT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN AND HAVE YOU KNOW IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OURSELVES IN TERMS OF TRAVEL BAN SIX CETERA THIS WHOLE NOTION OF CALIFORNIA GROWN BY CALIFORNIA. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY HAVE AN OFFICE IN SACRAMENTO I GET TAX BASED ON BUSINESS EFFICIENCY I'M LOOKING AT A LITTLE BIGGER GRANDER SCALE AND- THESE ARE PUBLIC DOLLARS BEING USED TO CONSTRUCT IN THIS IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. FOR US TO ENGAGE A CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY THAT HAS A VARIETY OF BENEFITS SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY. NOT JUST A MATTER HAVE AN OFFICE IN SACRAMENTO BUT I'M HOPING THAT WE TRULY DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY. TO ENGAGE IN THE PROCUREMENT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. SIR MORLOCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I MISTER HART ON THIS PHOTO I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO GIVE ME THE VISION. FOR THE VISITOR CENTER BECAUSE- THIS IS THE ICONIC. VIEW OF THE CAPITOL AND I'M. YOU KNOW FROM TOWER BRIDGE TO YOU KNOW EVERYWHERE THIS IS. THIS IS IT AND I'M JUST TRYING TO. GRAB YOUR VISION FOR THE VISITOR CENTER BEING RIGHT IN THE FRONT. SURE IT'S UNDERGROUND TOTALLY AGREE AROUND YES SO IF I'M MAY. IN THE AREA HERE IS ABOUT THREE AND A HALF BEFORE WE TALK. SO THAT WE REPLACE WAS SO SCARED OUT OVER ON THE SIDE WE ARE LOCATED IN A SCRATCH. WE HAVE ABOUT ANY DESIGN SMILED AND SAID. GLASS ELEVATOR HERE. THE ELEVATOR HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED THOSE TIME. SO HE'S WHICH WOULD TAKE IT DOWN BELOW AND THERE WOULD BE FOR THE GRASSES TO ENSURE SKYLIGHT. WHICH IS I THINK ONE OF THE IMAGES OF YOU. LOOK EXHAUSTED THE BILL ALSO BRING IN NATURAL LIGHT. TO THE LIKE THAT ARE. THE REST OF THE SPACE WOULD BE JUST AS A PRESENT. ONE THOUGHT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS YOU CURRENTLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TERRACE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OF TERRACE HERE WE THOUGHT ABOUT REINFORCING THAT. AND POSSIBLY READING IS LIGHT INTO THE LOWER LEVEL THROUGH A LITTLE STRONGER TERRACE WITH WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BASE. WOULD NOT BE ANY HIGHER THAN THE FLOOR LEVEL. TAKE YOUR THE SECOND QUESTION. IN OUR OFFICES SENATOR BATES AND I WE WERE COUNTY SUPERVISORS WE HAD A BAXTER THAT WE COULD EXIT THE BUILDING FROM AND WE HAD A SEPARATE ELEVATOR THAT WE CAN ONLY ACCESS FROM OUR OFFICES SO IF THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE LOBBY OR IN THE HALLWAYS SURE YOU COULD STILL GET OUT GET TO YOUR CAR. IT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT HERE YOU YOU YOU GET EXPOSED RIGHT THE MANY YOU'RE OUT IN THE HALLWAY. TV CRUISER WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU DO AND YOU JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. BUT IT. I'M JUST CURIOUS IN THE DESIGN WILL THERE BE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR LEGISLATORS. JUST TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS FREE OF. INTRUSION RIGHT WE ARE WE ARE STUDYING DIFFERENT. DESIGNS THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A COURTHOUSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A WAY IN IN A WAY OUT THAT WOULD BE SECURED WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF. IMPACT TO YOUR ABILITY TO DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS BOTH FOR GOOD AND BAD WHEN YOU HAVE TO WALK OUT INTO A PUBLIC CORRIDOR IF YOU'RE LATE FOR A MEETING THAT'S DIFFICULT SO IN A LOT OF CAPITAL SO WE HAVE RE DONE WE USUALLY TRY TO PROVIDE A WAY OUT THROUGH THE BACK SO THAT YOU CAN GET TO YOUR NEXT MEETING. EASILY AND QUICKLY WE DID THAT BOTH IN UTAH WE'VE DONE THAT IN WYOMING IN THE EXTENSION DOWN BELOW AND WE'VE DONE SOME OF THAT IN THE MINNESOTA CAPITAL WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THOSE TYPE OF THINGS AS WELL AS YOUR OFFICES I THINK BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT A AN OFFICE BUILDING. MORE THAN TRYING TO RESTRUCTURE THE INTERIOR OF THE CAPITAL WEHAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE KIND OF A TOOL CORRIDOR SYSTEM SO THERE WOULD BE A CORRIDOR THAT WOULD BE DESIGNED FOR THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE THE LARGE NUMBERS AS YOU HAD A FEW TO GO WHERE YOU HAD SOME OF THE HEARINGS YOU'RE HAVING. AS WELL AS OF EMBERS AN OP YOU TO MOVE ABOUT AND GET WHERE THEY THEY NEED TO GO BUT AT THE SAME TIME GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY IF YOU CHOOSE TO OUT IN IN INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO WE WANT TO TRY TO DO. THANK YOU. YOU CAN THAT IDEA OF THAT. TO THE COT SHELTER IN SPACE WHICH IS LESS ABOUT HIS TO THE MEMBERS IN JUST A PRACTICAL UPDATE IN FACILITIES FOR SORT OF THE ERROR WE FIND OURSELVES IN BECAUSE I THINK THOSE SORTS OF SPACES WHILE THEY DO SPEED YOU ABOUT YOUR WORK. AND THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH IS A LAWMAKER. YOUR BASIC LIFE IS TO DEPLOY YOUR SELF THE SPAN OF HOURS YOU HAVE IN THE BUILDING HAS EFFECTIVELY YOU CAN WHEN YOU'RE PUBLIC BUSINESS. SO THIS WHOLE BILL IS ABOUT DEPLOYMENT OF SELF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY LAWMAKERS AND THIS WAS A QUARTER TO SUPPORT THAT BUT THERE IS A SHELTER SPACE. CONRAD COULD YOU SORT OF CONNECTED TO CORRECT WE HAVE. YES AND IF IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT AS YOU SAW ON THE DIAGRAM THE PARKING STRUCTURE IS NOT UNDERNEATH THE- NEW ANNEX. THE NEW ACT WILL HAVE A BASEMENT AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO OUT THERE AND THERE WILL BE. CONNECTING ELEMENTS THAT'LL CONNECT YOU FROM THE ANNEX BUILDING THE NEW ANNEX BUILDING TO THE NEW PARKING STRUCTURE. AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT MAKING THOSE POSSIBLY AN AREA WHERE IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY YOU CAN CHILDREN PLACE. OR IF THERE IS A THREAT THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN GO THERE WE THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT SO THAT YOU CAN BE REMOVED FROM THAT THREATEN BE SAFE IF THERE IS SOMETHING. BUT YET STILL BE ABLE TO COME BACK ONCE THE BUILDING HAS BEEN CLEARED AND CONTINUE WITH THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. THANK YOU RETIREMENT MS COMMODO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THIS PRESENTATION I'M ACTUALLY HAVING FLASHBACKS OF MY TIME AT THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND OVERSEEING THE CONSTRUCTION BOND THAT WE HAD THERE FAR SMALLER NUMBERS VERY SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS I WROTE SOME THINGS DOWN AND BECAUSE I STEPPED IN LATE MAYBE THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT YOU HAD PRESENTED AND SORT OF ANSWER FOR ME SO IF THAT'S THE CASE I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE. BUT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE QUESTION RAISED BY SENATOR MITCHELL ABOUT YOU KNOW SUBS PRIMES APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES I KNOW WHEN WE RALLY CCD AND WE WERE WORKING WITH PRIME IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO ASKED AS YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF APPRENTICE OPPORTUNITIES WE'RE GOING TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE CREATING A PIPELINE ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO VOCATIONAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES EXPANDING ON THAT IS THE CONVERSATION AROUND LOCAL HIRE. AND EVEN THOUGH THIS IS CONSTRUCTION THAT'S HAPPENING IN SACRAMENTO IT IS A STATE BUILDING AND SO HOW WE WOULD BE DEFINING LOCAL HIGHER IN THIS INSTANCE ALSO HAD A QUESTION KIND OF ABOUT. THE FINANCING OF THIS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE SAME BUT WHEN I WAS THAT THE DISTRICT WE ALSO HAD BOND ISSUANCE FIRMS THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR. THE SELLING OF THE BOND SO THAT WE COULD FINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION AND DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU COULD SHARE ANY HIGHLIGHTS ON THAT. AND ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW THERE WAS A PROCUREMENT PROCESS A BIDDING PROCESS TO FIND THOSE FIRMS AND HOW WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S DIVERSEREPRESENTATION. IN IN THAT AREA AS WELL. IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR EXPECTATION AROUND CHANGE ORDERS I SEE THAT THE NUMBER IS QUITE HIGH EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND SO I ALSO SEE THAT THERE'S CONTINGENCIES. WE ARE. IN THE THROES OF CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AROUND TRADE AND TERRORISTS AND SO JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE ABOUT THE STAYING ON BUDGET OR BELOW BUDGET. YOU KNOW GIVEN THE REALITIES OF THE DAY THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND JUST WANT TO HAVE A REALISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF IF WE WOULD BE COMING BACK TO THE TABLE. WITH BUDGETING. AS IT RELATES TO CONSTRUCTION ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF RECYCLING REUSING MATERIALS YOU KNOW AND IF THAT'S A CONVERSATION AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION. AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE VISITORS CENTER I ALSO BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT EXCAVATION YOU KNOW AND I HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE WE WERE LOOKING TO UPGRADE ONE OF OUR COLLEGES AND. I'M THE NOSE TO EVERYONE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THERE WAS A- OIL REFINERY UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE BUILDINGS AND SO THE COST TO ACTUALLY CLEAN ALL OF THEN OUT THROUGH THE EXCAVATION WAS ALMOST THE SAME AS THE COST TO. BUILD THE NEW FACILITY AND SO IF THERE ANY SORT OF PLAN PRELIMINARY DATA THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT WHAT. UNEXPECTED THINGS THAT WILL NOW BE EXPECTED THAT YEAR. THAT WILL BE UNDERNEATH ALL OF THIS AS WE'RE DOING THAT THAT WOULD BE CURIOUS TO ME TO KNOW BECAUSE IT'S THOSE THINGS THAT END UP RAISING THE COST SO I KNOW THAT THOSE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF QUESTIONS AND I'M SORRY FOR MY PTSD BUT- SO THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT. THANK. HE WANTED TO THE PRINCE. OKAY SO I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION WITH WITH RESPECT APPRENTICESHIPS UNDER THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT I TALK ABOUT MY PRESENTATION ONE OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES IS TO WORK OUT THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS AND IN OUR PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS IT'S CLEAR TO ME AND I THINK THEY WOULD REITERATE THAT APPRENTICESHIPS ARE A BIG PART. OF THOSE AGREEMENTS INTO SURE THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS. IN IT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE. THE CONTRACTORS THAT WE WORK WITH TO. GO OUT AND SEEK A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SUB CONTRACTORS. TO PROPOSE ON THESE PROJECTS IN IN AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THAT THEY'LL PROVIDE INDUSTRY DAYS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS TO BRING PEOPLE TO THAT TO CREATE CREATE GENERATE INTEREST. IN THOSE THINGS SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND TRY TO. BRING ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT WE CAN TO THE TABLE SO THAT WE CAN UTILIZE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AS FAR AS BONDS AGO I'M NOT REALLY INVOLVED WITH THE BOND SIDE OF THINGS I THINK HAT. FOR THOSE QUESTIONS WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND HOW THOSE ARE. ARE BEING HANDLED. WITH REGARD TO CHANGE ORDERS I CAN EITHER WILL BE CHANGE ORDERS NO SET OF DRAWINGS BY AN ARCHITECT IS PERFECT. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE INSURERS WILL PROBABLY BE IN THE 567% RANGE WHICH IS PRETTY STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY WE WILL WORK WITH THOSE ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS TO TRY TO GET THOSE DOWN AS LOW AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK ONE OF THE KEYS TO THAT IS UTILIZING CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK AS WELL AS A DESIGN BUILD PROCUREMENT METHOD. I THINK THAT WAY WERE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENT REVIEWS AND CONSTRUCT ABILITY REVIEWS BY THE CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE THE ARCHITECT WITH INFORMATION SO THAT THEY CAN IMPROVE THE DRYING BEFORE THEY'RE ACTUALLY FINISHED TOO OFTEN THOSE DRAWINGS COME OUT WITH ERRORS OMISSIONS OR THINGS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE LET'S JUST SAY. AND BY HAVING A GOOD CONSTRUED ABILITY REVIEW BY A CONSTRUCTION MANAGER OR SOMEBODY WHO IS THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD THE BUILDING AND WHO'S GOING TO GIVE US WHAT'S CALLED A GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE TO THE BUILDING BUT WE ARE ABLE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CHANGE ORDERS SO WE'VE SEEN I'M PROUD THAT WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN. FROM UTAH TO MINNESOTA MEANING. WE'VE BEEN. LARGE COMPLICATED OBJECTS ON BUDGET BELOW BUDGET AND SO I FEEL I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE BUDGET NUMBER IN THE CONTINGENCIES THAT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER NOW AS WE GO THROUGH AND WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT AND WE START TO SEE DESIGNS COME ABOUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO BUDGETING WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO ESTIMATING A SOME OF THAT CONTINGENCY THAT IS CURRENTLY THERE WILL MOVE INTO OTHER PORTIONS OF THE PROJECT WE WILL ALWAYS CARRY A CONTINGENCY HOWEVER TO ACCOMMODATE AND MAKE SURE WE CAN HANDLE. THE CHANGE ORDERS UP WILL BE A ANTICIPATED. AND THEN IT FAR AS THE MATERIALS AND EXCAVATION WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED. A DIALOGUE WITH SOME OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES THAT WERE FAMILIAR IN THIS AREA. THE SEQUEL. REPORT HAS IDENTIFIED THOSE WE BEGUN CONVERSATIONS WITH ASSEMBLYMAN ROMMEL'S. WITH REGARDS TO HOW WE WANT TO PROCEED WE'RE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF WAYS OF. TRYING TO IDENTIFY IF THERE ARE ANY REMAINS FROM BOTH EXCAVATION AS WELL AS CADAVER DOGS. WE ARE ALSO PUTTING IN PLACE PROTOCOL AND PROCEDURES TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE JUST COMPLETED A EARLY PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL OR NOT. THE GEO TECHNICAL REPORT TO WHERE WE START TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS BELOW THE GROUND. AND GIVING US AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE STRADDLE US LIKE AS WE- MOVE FORWARD. SO I THINK THOSE WERE YOUR- ALL THE LOCAL HIGHER. I AM I HAVE TO GO LOOK INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS THERE. AND HOW TO DEFINE THAT IS YOUR QUESTION AND WE WILL DO THAT AND- TRY TO GET INFORMATION BACK TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. VERY EXCITING AND HISTORIC TIME AND I'VE LIKE TO KIND OF HEARKEN TO THE PAST JUST BET. AS WE PROCEED TO THE FUTURE. IT WAS INVASION ONE THE OLD SIDE HERE THE ICONIC SIDE WAS DEEMED TO BE NON BUT NOT SAFE FOR. EARTHQUAKES. A LOT OF DISCUSSION OCCURRED AND I WAS NOT HERE THEN. BUT I WOULD PROBABLY DO WHAT WENT ON. AND THE DESIGN OF THE TWO TWIN TOWERS WAS BECOMING A PREFERRED OPTION FOR THE NEW CAPITAL. AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS ICONIC SIDE. I WOULD ARGUE THAT LIES REMINDS PREVAILED. AND THE RESTORATION OF KURT. IT WAS RATHER AMAZING THAT. ARTISANS AND WORKMEN COULD IN WOMEN COULD BE FOUND THAT COULD EMULATE THE WORK OF THAT HERE. IT HAPPENED WONDERFUL. THAT WAS RESTORED. AND IT WAS DONE IN A MANNER THAT WAS COMPLIMENTARY TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. ADDITION TO THE CAPITAL. DIDN'T DETRACT FROM THE DID VIRTUALLY I WOULD SAY. ADDED TO IT. BUT AS THIS IS PROGRESS TO DO DECADES THERE HAS BEEN A HEARKENING TO PRESERVE THAT ICONIC INTEGRITY. OF THE HISTORY OF THE STATE AS ITS REPRESENTATIVE IN THE CAPITAL. SOME MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE IN THE GOLDEN DOME BECAME LESS GOLDEN THAT IT HAD BEEN BEFORE BUT- IT WAS LARGELY PRESERVED. AND IT IS MY HOPE AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. ARE VERY MUCH DEBT DEVOTED TO HISTORY. UNDER HERTZBERG CENTER MORE LIKE AN OBVIOUS YOU ARE CHAIRMAN I KNOW IS. THAT WE ASK BROUGH PROCEED THAT WE'RE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. PRESERVER PRESERVATION OF THAT ICONIC INTEGRITY THAT WE HAVE ENJOYED HERE. IT ACTUALLY CONTINUED EVEN TO THE OPENING OF THAT. GRAND CAPITAL WHEN THE RESTORATION WAS COMPLETED AND THERE WAS A DINNER. IN THE ROTUNDA FOR ALL THE LEGISLATORS. WHAT WAS SERVED WAS PERIOD FOOD. THE POWER FAMILY OF THE NUT TREE FAME ACTUALLY EMULATED THE KINDS OF MEALS. ONE WOULD HAVE IN THOSE YEARS NO I'M NOT TRYING TO GET TO THAT FIND NIGHT OF DEGREE BUT I'M SAYING THAT THERE WAS CERTAINLY AT AND IT HERE IT'S- TO HISTORY. AND I WOULD ENCOURAE US AS WE PROCEED HERE BEING STEWARDS OF THE FUTURE. TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT SAYS VERY CAREFULLY PRESERVED WHAT I'VE SEEN OF YOUR EFFORTS SO FAR THOSE WHO HAVE PRECEDED YOU AND US HERE DEVELOPING THIS PROJECT I THINK THAT YOU'RE- YOU'RE WELL ON YOUR WAY TO MAINTAINING THAT INTEGRITY. BUT AS MY SMALL PART OF THIS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS I'M GOING TO CERTAINLY BE AWARE AND WARY OF ENSURING THAT INTEGRITY. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WE HAVE BEEN JOINED BY THE SECTOR THE SENATE ERICA CONTRAIRE US WHO WITH HER COUNTERPART EVER GRAVER MY HOUSES OKAY HELPING SUPPORT THIS ENTERPRISE SO. AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU HERE. MS CAN FIRST THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WITHOUT I WANT TO SAY THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AND AS DESCRIBED WE HAVE BEEN JUST. POUNDING AWAY ON THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE ESTABLISHED A LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE WORK WITH THE. BROWN A NEW SUPER MINISTRATION WERE MEETING REGULARLY THE POS DOCUMENT THIS DOCTOR WHICH STRUCTURES THE SCHEDULE IN THE BUDGET AND THE DELIVERY METHOD IS COMING TOGETHER ACCORDING TO A PLAN. WE'RE PROCEEDING TO PUT THAT IN PLACE I WOULD EXPECT THAT AT OUR NEXT EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING. THE POS BASIC STRUCTURE WILL BE APPROVED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. AND SO I ANTICIPATE THAT WILL ACTUALLY SEEK TO HAVE A BRIEF JOINT RULES COMMITTEE MEETING BEFORE WE ADJOURN FOR THE FALL. WHERE WE AS A JOINT RULES COMMITTEE SORT OF GIVE A THUMBS UP TO THE PLAN IS IT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED SWIM OUT THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE NEXT STEP WORK AT THE PUBLIC WORKS FOR THE PARK FINANCE. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT SENATOR NIELSEN HAS ALLUDED THE RESTORATION OF THAT BUILDING. WHICH WAS DONE AND FULLY FUNDED. BY GOVERNOR BRAND AT THE OUTSET FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE LESSER COUNTS FOR THAT PROJECT. AND THESE STAIRS STRIPPER TERREL THE DIANNE BOARD ONE SUBSCRIBER SIMILARLY CONTEMPLATES THAT UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE PURSUANT TO THEM YOU OF PURSUANT TO LESSEN AGREEMENT ONCE WE AGREE ON THINGS WE SEND IT OVER THE PUBLIC WORKS FOR WERE UPON ITS APPROVAL FUNDING WOULD MOVE OVER. AND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE BOND FUNDING WAS INDEED INTENDED TO BE BACK UP PLAN. THE FACT IS WHATEVER PRICE TAG ASSOCIATE THIS PROJECT MAY BE IT WILL BE CHEAPER IF WE'RE NOT PAYING INTEREST ON THE FUNDS TO THE BONTA MAC. AND SO I A I THINK THE GOVERNOR BROWN GAVE GREAT LEADERSHIP TO AGREE TO A METHOD THAT WE COULD SET UP A PLAN. PUT IN PLACE AND THEN HAVE THAT FUNDING PROVIDED AND IT'S BEEN THE WORK OF. QUITE A BIT OF TIME OUR SENIOR STAFF WORK WITH OTHERS IN STATE GOVERNMENT. ANY FUNDS ALLOCATE THIS PROGRAM BY THIS PROCESS WILL BE EARNING INTEREST. SO WE WILL HAVE INTEREST IT WILL BE A PART OF THAT AND IT SAT IN NUMBERS TO THE- TO THE SOUNDNESS OF THE PROJECT. SO WITH THAT. I THINK THE- OFFICIAL GIVEN TAKE A BACK AND FORTH WE DO HAVE AN OPTION FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE WE SHOULD MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT I WOULD INVITE YOU FORWARD. AT THIS TIME TO SIT BENEATH THE SCREEN. AND. I WILL I KNOW WE HAVE THE C. H. P. IN THE ROOM THEREFORE CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE SECURITY CONVERSATION AND WITH OUR SERGEANTS THAT'S A KEY ROLE BECAUSE OF WE ARE MAKING LATE CHOICES ON SECURITY THOSE WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO GET TO THE CHANGE ORDER ISSUE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN UNCONSCIOUS WITH US FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS AND I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN A PART OF TRYING TO KEEP THE COSTS ON TRACK ALL OF OURS. SERGEANTS. SO THEN WITH THAT HAVING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I THINK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. TO THIS MATTER AND THIS. FIFTY MEETING OF THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE ON THE CAP LAST PROJECT IS HEREBY JR
