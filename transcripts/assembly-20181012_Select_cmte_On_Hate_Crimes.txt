A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL -- ON HER OWN HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS -- IN WHAT KIND OF BOWLING CAN IT WILL OCCUR.

IT'S EASY TO THINK ABOUT SANTA CLARA COUNTY AS KIND OF A SAFE PLACE AND I DAVE WHAT YOU JUST POINTED OUT IS THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT MORE WE CAN DO ON THIS END? AND I ALSO JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT -- DAVE -- AND BY LEAD RE M. HEARINGS HERE ONE THAT WAS FOCUSED ON WOMEN ONE THAT WAS FOCUSED ON ON HATE CRIMES IN REAL CLIMATE -- AT THE OTHER THAT WAS FOCUSED ON IMMIGRATION AND THIS WAS REALLY A RESPONSE TO THE NATIONAL ELECTION AS IT OCCURRED BECAUSE IN MANY OF YOU WERE HERE. BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WHAT WERE THE IMPLICATIONS OF HAVING -- REALLY A BULLY RUNNING THE HOW DO WE TALK TO OUR CHILDREN ABOUT IT HOW DO WE BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT. SO OUT OF THAT WE CAME UP WITH A NUMBER OF A POLICIES AND ONE THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU WAS A COUNTY. ANTI BULLYING POLICY. AND IN THE IN THE NEXT MONTH -- THE STAFF WILL COME BACK WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT POLICY BECAUSE WE BOTH WANTED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR OUTWARD FACING ORGANIZATION.

I HAD NO IDEA -- HOW PERVASIVE BOWLING WOULD BE WHEN I WAS A CHILD? THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES I THINK WE OFTEN THINK OF BOWLING IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE WHAT REALLY. FOR CHILDREN. AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW NORM. THAT'S BEING ACCEPTED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. ANY OTHER PART OF THAT THAT SORT OF A STANDING TO ME IS THAT DAVE AND I WERE HEARING YESTERDAY. WHERE WE HAD AN ADVOCATE FOR THE? AT IT WITH SENIORS AT SENIOR ORGANIZATIONS AND SENIOR HOUSING.

KNOW COMMITTED [INAUDIBLE] TO WORKING. IMPROVE OUR TOWN IS RESPONSE. TO BOTH HE IS AS WELL AS BULLYING WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND AS COUNCIL MEMBER. I'M SUPERVISORS OF AS MENTIONED OUTSIDE SCHOOL AS WELL. WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAM AND OUR EFFORTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. TO ADDRESS WHAT WE ARE NOW SEEING AS A HUGE RISE AND NOT ONLY HATE CRIMES BUT HATE REALLY SPEECH AND HE OR LET'S CALL BACKS WE HAVE OUR CREATE IT UP HOTLINE FOR MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY TO CALL IN. THE MONARCH TWENTY FOUR BURKE OR IS IT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AT RESPOND TO IN REAL TIME. THE REAL PERSON HAVE MORE BILINGUAL -- FOLKS WITH IN OUR OFFICE WHO THREW IT. VERY MUCH AFFECTED BY BULLYING WITHIN THE SCHOOL SETTING THAT IS NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR ABILITY TO THRIVE WITHIN SCHOOL BUT ALSO. OR DESIRE TO ATTEND SCHOOL AT ALL WE'RE SEEING A RISE IN SCHOOL REFORM IS ALL. SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM AND SCHOOL TROOP AND CITY AND THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I READ ARE TRUANCY IN ATTENDANCE YET NOT VERY CLOSE WITH ORAL EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR COUNTY INCLUDING FREMONT IF I'D. ON THAT TOPIC. BUT I WANTED TO DISCUSS BRIEFLY. AS ARE LOST TO REFUND IT BULLYING. AND FACT AT THE CALIFORNIA PEACE CODE ACTUALLY DOESN'T DEFINE BULL BEING AS A CRIME. DOESN'T DEFINE BULLYING AT ALL WE COULD NOT GO INTO A COURT ROOM WHICH THE PERSON CHART WITH THAT I'M OF ITS EGGS. AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN WORK. IN THE IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW WHAT GOALS WE HAVE THE ENGINE COURTROOM -- SUPPORT BOTH THE VICTIM AND HOLD THE PERPETRATOR COUNSEL. FOR BULLYING CONDUCT -- THERE ABOUT THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR PEOPLE CODE SECTIONS THAT WERE HE TURNS TO ONE IS OKAY ACTION. SIX FIFTY THREE IT'S A PERCENT USING ELECTRONIC RIGHT. MAKES REPEATED -- ROUSING -- CONSTITUTE ANOTHER WHEN WE THIRDS MAJORS IN KIDS WITH THE NONSTOP PHONE CALLING IN HERE YEP I'M CALLING IT. AND MAKING IN ARE THREATENING COMMENTS THAT OUT COURSE EXPANDED TO ANY MEANS OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION WHICH IS FRONT AND CENTER CYBERBULLYING. I'M PENAL CODE SECTION FOUR TWENTY TWO ARE IS BASICALLY COVERING THREAT. AND THAT IS A PERSON AND THREATENS TO KILL OR PHYSICALLY HARM SOMEBODY. AT EPCOT THREAT IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY IMPACT IS BELIEVED AND IT IS A QUICK CALL AN IMMEDIATE. THE LAW WAS CHANGED W. IS BACK TO INCLUDE. THAT THAT RECORD DONE. WRITING VERBALLY OR TRYING TO INDICATE AN INNING [INAUDIBLE] LABOR THREATS. THERE IS NO CODE SECTION PROHIBITS THE PRECIPITATION OF ANOTHER ONLINE SO IF FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THIS HAPPENS OFTEN IN SCHOOLS FOR A STUDENT WILL THE LIBRARY. DOING WORK FINANCING OR HER -- MAIL ADDRESS AT FORGET TO SIGN OUT LEAVE INSTANTLY YOUR DOG AND STUFF IF YOU'RE OPEN ANOTHER STUDENT WILL COME SIT DOWN AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL. REALIZE HERE SHE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PORTABLE AND THAT AND AND HARASSES. THE PERSON EIGHT IN THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE PART TAKE PLACE. A SCHOOL SETTINGS AND THE FINAL PENAL CODE SECTION THAT WAS REALLY THAT SOMETHING WE REALLY REAL. CYBER STALKING. THOUGH. SHOULD ONLY I'VE BEEN IN THE D. IS OFFICE FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEAR IN MY FIRST TEN YEARS IN THE OFFICE OF OUT OF STOCK IN CASE. IT WAS WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY THINK OF SOMEBODY WAS CONSTANTLY GOING UP BUT SOMEONE HOUSE FOLLOW THEM TO BURKE. FOLLOWING THEM AROUND SCHOOL AND CREATING FEAR THAT WAY AND THE CYBER STALKING STATUTE -- INCORPORATES THAT NONSTOP. ALWAYS. BUT VIA AN ONLINE [INAUDIBLE] PLATFORM AND FLYING AS THE IN PERSONS GETTING. MY COLLEAGUE HERE AND I ARE GOING TO SHARE OUR MINUTES EACH AND MINE IT WILL BE A FULL FOURTEEN THAT'S TO BE LITTLE MORE DYNAMIC FOR YOU SO I'M GONNA TURN OVER. TO MY LEAGUE FROM THIS COUNTY YEAH TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ASSEMBLY I SURE. AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING AT FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT. WE'RE REALLY LUCKY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AT OUR BORDERS SUPERVISORS TO ORDER THE DA'S OFFICE TO HAVE COMMUNITY PROSECUTORS TO DO READ. IN THE COMMUNITY ON ALL SORTS OF ISSUES. INCLUDING POURING AND HE I'M SO FOR EXAMPLE. LAST YEAR ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY PROSECUTOR ORGANIZED A CONFERENCE AT GOOGLE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. SCHOOL. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ADDRESS HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. MOST USERS ARE IN THE SCHOOL. NOT JUST. TWO ABOUT WHEN THE PRIME BUT WHEN THERE'S A BULLYING AND HARASSMENT DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF CRIME. BUT IT'S STILL VERY HURTFUL BOTH TO THE INDIVIDUAL. TARGETED INTO THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY THE BAD HOW WE CAN ADDRESS. WHEN THAT HAPPENS FOR THOSE PERPETRATOR BUT ALSO HOW WE CAN ADDRESS YOU? IN THE WHOLE SCHOOL COMMUNITY AND I THREW HIS LAST YEAR AT OF THE MIND HIGH SCHOOL IN PLENTY OF NOT ONLY WAS THERE A SERIES OF INCIDENTS INVOLVING. REYES ALL AND JUST HARASSMENT. THERE WAS AN INTERVIEW DID NOT ONLY DEALT WITH THE PERPETRATOR TO THAT PROCESS AND AND TRY TO HELP THE VICTIMS OF THAT PROCESS AND REALLY FOR THE WHOLE SCHOOL COMMUNITY TO HAVE. PAST THAT AND I THINK THAT'S THE NETS IMPORTANT FOR US. TO FIND IT THINK ABOUT. AS FAR AS WE'RE BOTH BEING AND HATE CRIME. INTER STACK DON'T REMOTE IN THE BLACK COMMITTEE MEMBERS IDEA ABOUT AN INCIDENT. THAT HAPPENED IN OUR COMMUNITY A COUPLE YEARS AGO BUT SAN JOSE STATE THERE WAS A SUBJECT OF BEGINNING BORING BUT AT THE END OF HATE CRIMES. AND BY HIS TWEET MATES USE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENT. AND M.. YEAH AND HE WAS PUT IN A BIKE LOCK. RIGHT WITH ME. BUT BEFORE THEN. AS DISPLAYS SWASTIKA IN THEIR DORM ROOM SUITE THERE WAS THE CONF READ FULL BAG THAT PRESENT USE OF A VERSION OF THE N. WORD. IT WAS REFERRING TO AN S. THREE FIFTHS WHICH IS A REFERENCE. TO THE U. S. CONSTITUTION THAT REFERRED TO AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY. OF A PERSON IN THE REGION. DOCUMENTATION. SOMEONE THE HIGHLIGHT ALL OF YOU BUT THAT WAS THE END OF THAT CASE WHERE THE JURY. FOUND THESE. THREE THE FACT IS GUILTY OF CRIMES BUT DIDN'T FIND THEM GUILTY OF HATE CRIMES. AND THE REASON WHY I WANNA HIGHLIGHT THAT. IS BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT. IMPLICIT BIAS NOT COMPLETED THIS LOSING THE BATTLE ACT LISTED BY S.. THERE REALLY WAS A CHALLENGE FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE JURY. TO LABEL. YOUNG WHITE COLLEGE STUDENTS AS ASSIST. YOU WITH THEIR DECISION. GOING TO BE DOING. AND THAT MADE IT I THINK AN EXTRA BURDEN TO OVERCOME AND TO WHAT WAS VERY BRAVE FOR THIS. JURY THAT WHAT WE VIEW AS A SIN VERY EXPLICIT. A RACIALLY MOTIVATED AND INCIDENTS AND ALSO IN IT ACT. AS MORE THAN JUST AN ATTACK AT A CRIME. DAHLE MINIATURE ACT BY A COLLEAGUE IN WILL KEEP UP TEXTING IT. ADDITIONS TO IN OUR HATE CRIMES. THAT ARE. UP REYES FAITH OR RELIGION. PROP UP IN OUR SCHOOL OF COURSE RECEIPT. OF CYBERBULLYING AT THAT VENTURES AROUND -- SPECIAL. EXCEPT AS SEXTING AND SEX GENDER BASED -- ONE THING THAT WE HAVE FOUND SO IMPORTANT IS TO GO OF COURSE. EDUCATION IS AGE APPROPRIATE AND START TALKING ARM AT THAT TIME. ABOUT. THE INJURY THAT K. POP UP FROM IN -- TO IT WITHIN EITHER DOUBLE OR GIRL'S IN TERMS OF WHAT IS BEING LISTED. ONLINE AND THAT WHAT WE WHAT TROUBLE THEY GET INTO BOTH. MOST ONLY SO BILLY AS WELL AS THE VEHICLE DISCIPLINED AND MAYBE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OF IF OFF. THE ENGAGED IN. AND REBEL BEING IN THIS -- EIGHT IN IT BILL ALSO I HEARD SOMEBODY MENTION -- HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS IT TO THE ARENA TO WITH I'M SORRY LEAGUE SPLIT AND MINE. AND WE FIND THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IF THE GREATER NOT TOO YOUNG. TO JOIN THE CONVERSATION. AND THE STUDENT. PROGRESS IN SCHOOL THAT. MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEN AGAIN IN HIGH SCHOOL IT'S COOL COLD BUT WE AS EXPLICIT AND MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION. AT AT ONE THING THAT I AM TOLD. BY THE STUDENTS THAT I WORK WITH IS THAT. HE'S. ASSEMBLY'S OR JUST AT OR INFORMATIONAL THOUGHT AS WORK MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY ARE LED BY STUDENTS THEMSELVES. UP AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING HE FOR US ALL TO REMEMBER THAT OFTENTIMES THEY DON'T WANT FROM US THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM THEIR PEAK -- IS. THOUGH -- TRAINING AND THEN HERE TO APPEAR. IN ACTION AND IT. REALLY REALLY STRONG. YOUR WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME APPOINTED DRAFT AN ASPECT OF BULLET BEING ON CAMPUS. THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET. EDUCATION CODE ALLOWS SCHOOL SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DISCIPLINE STUDENTS ARE TO TAKE OTHER KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS WHEN THERE'S BLINKING ON CAMPUS AND I THINK IT'S NINE CENTER. WE NOT UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH. THAT EXTENDS OUT. THERE INVOLVED MEMBER SCHOOL COMMUNITY. OFF CAMPUS OR NOT WITHIN THE SCHOOL ORDERS SO IF YOU HAVE AN INCIDENT WHERE. SCHOOL STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE. ARE TEXT NEW CHAIR WITH IT GROUP OR ARE. SCHOOL ALL THE PEOPLE ARE MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE PART OF THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO SAY WOW THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE US BACK ACTUALLY VERY MUCH IT DOES INVOLVE. US IN THE SCHOOL IS. THE BEST PLACE I THINK. TO WORK ON COMMUNITY PROBLEMS IS THE COMMUNITY THAT'S BEING TARRED. IS PART OF THAT SCHOOL UNITY AND WE AND ARE TRINITY PROSECUTOR FOR THE D. TOP TERROR HERE TO PARTNER WITH OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS TO HELP YOU TO FIGURE OUT. IS A VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE ALSO WHAT KIND OF INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE SO. WHAT I HAD THERE ARE IS SOMETHING THAT STUDENTS CAN BUY INTO A CAN HERE COMMUNITY WE CAN WORK ON TOGETHER? EDIT EDITION TO WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS IT ALSO VITAL BUT PROGRAMMING IS AS TARGETED TOWARD THE PARENTS. OF STUDENTS WHO ARE FULLY EIGHT AS WELL AS ARMS OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE BULLYING STUDIES SHOW THAT. THIS THE KIDS DO NOT FALL INTO ONE CATEGORY OR THE OTHER OFTENTIMES. SINCE. HE WAS LEAD. CAN ALSO BECOME WILL LEAD OR VICE VERSA AND WHAT. AN POINT THAT I THINK IS CRITICAL TO TAKE WAY FOR DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THE CHILD -- JUST GO ONLINE BECAUSE IT'S NOT REAL STUCK AND IT SEEMS SO. EASY JUST DON'T LOOK YOUR INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT OR DO TURN ON YOUR COMPUTER AND THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER. AND THEN THE OTHER IS NOT WRITTEN TO TAKE AWAY -- THAT DEVICE AS A AN ISSUE BECAUSE THAT JUST DRIVES VICTIMIZATION AND THEIR GROUND AND O'DONNELL TO WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE YOU THAT AFRAID. TO COME OUT AND TELL A TEACHER OR TALK. FOR FEAR OF HAVING THEIR DEBATES TAKEN FROM THAT WHICH IS REALLY. HOUSE WITH A LIFELINE AND WAY OF PLANNER ACTION THAT IS THE NORM RATHER THAN. THEN NOT BOUGHT. EIGHT BELIEVE THAT WE READ THROUGH OUR FOURTEEN MINUTES EARTH THAT WENT BACK. TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SURE THAT THE PERSON AND AND INFORMATION. YOU MENTIONED ABOUT HOW -- THE INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE PARENTS IS SAID ONLINE OR IS THE SOMEWHERE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP YOU GET THE WORDS OUT. ALAMEDA COUNTY WITH YOU GO REGULARLY INTO THE SCHOOLS AND WE HAVE PRESENTED IN THAT IT FOR THE STUDENT WE WILL. WE ARE ON CALL COME IN AND GIVE REASONS EIGHT IS AT A HAVE A POWER POINT THAT WE HAVE THE DATE. I AM SO IN THE OFFICE THAT WHEN I WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT MYSPACE. NO NOBODY DOES THAT IS MARK BUT WE DO TRY TO KEEP IT -- AND I WISH THAT THE THE YOU KNOW THE REASONS AND THAT WE HAVE -- TOGETHER AND I ALWAYS WELL. YEAH SORT OF BEING THE COMMUNITY KNOW THAT. WOULD BE IT. WILL COME ANY -- THAT WERE ASKED TO COME THAT A GROUP FEELS. WOULD BE OF HELP. TO YOU SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PUT A LINE. OF PEOPLE OF* STILL. ZERO ONE OF MY FROM FOR ME AS A AS THE THE PEOPLE OF COLOR YOU KNOW I WAS ALWAYS WONDERING. SHOULD I VERY INTERESTED ON WHAT YOU'RE OUT THERE FOR THE PARENTS. AND SONS -- LOOKS LIKE A OUR STATE WE HAVE SOME WORK TO HELP US. ROUTE FINE MAY BE. THE DEFINITION OF HATE CRIMES SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT THE AGE OF TO HAVE THOSE HUNGER KATE. WHO WAS STRAPPED YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THE? I THANK YOU. WITH KANSEN AND IT'S GREAT TO HEAR FROM IS MEGHAN AND MISTER GIVE IS OF COURSE THOSE ARE NOT ALWAYS ADOPTED. FROM HERE TO THE CHANCE -- TO TO TO KNOW JAMES WELL AS AS A VERY ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE THE PROSECUTOR AND IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THE WORK -- THANKS TO THE COUNTY AS WELL JUST CONTAINS OFFICE OF THE COMMITTEE PROSECUTORS I GOT THE CHANCE TO KNOW A LOT OF THEM OVER THE YEARS TO THINGS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. PROGRAM -- THAT WE HAVE AND AND YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT PROSECUTION THERE ARE TWO SIDES. TO THE NEED TO HAVE SOPHISTICATION AT THE THE VICTORIA LEVEL. ENGINES UNDERSTANDING THE COMMITTEE IN UNDERSTANDING -- HATE CRIMES ESPECIALLY AS THE POWERS TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING MORE RECENTLY SURE. THE PROCESSING THESE CRIMES AS HATE CRIMES BUT ALSO I'M THE DEFENSE PERSPECTIVE SOMETIMES THE RESPONSE FROM SOMEONE IS BEING BULLIED VICTIMIZED AT A RESPOND BACK IN UNDERSTANDING. THE CONTEXT OF THAT IT THERE MUST AMERICAN OR A SICK AMERICAN OR ODD LGBTQ AND THEY'RE BEING BULLIED -- IN A VARIETY OF WAYS INCLUDING ELECTRONICALLY AND AND THEY RESPOND BACK AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT YOU ASK. CHANNING DIG DIG DEEPER ON THE CONTEXT OF EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT SCHOOL OR IN THAT COMMUNITY OR IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I THINK HAS PARTICULARLY SINCE WE'VE -- SIAN AND IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS A PARTICULAR -- INCREASED NUMBER HE CRIES WITH AFTER BECAUSE LATIN AMERICANS IN A COMMITTEE CAN OF COURSE -- OVER SEVERAL YEARS -- AND EVEN THOUGH I THINK WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASED LEVEL OF INTENSITY AGAINST SOME AMERICANS A CERTAINLY WITH THE SOUTH ASIAN. OF THE COMMUNITY -- ELDERLY AMERICANS ARE GETTING BEATEN IT AND IT IS JUST. A HORRIBLE -- BUT A FEW YEARS. BUT WHAT'S WORSE ISN'T FROM OTHER COUNTIES ARE THE DATES. YET PROSCAR IS EIGHT TIMES A LIST -- WE HAVE PROSPECTORS ARE LEAST. IDENTIFY IT AS CRIES THE ISSUE MIGHT BE WITH THE DURING HIS OR WITH HOW YOU ACTUALLY ARE ABLE TO PROVE IT AND THAT'S AND MET. CANS MAKES A GOOD POINT ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE THE FRANKLY NOT LET THAT THE GROUND LEVEL I DO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE SAUDI PLEASE PART AND WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH -- THE ACADEMY THEY THEY MEET WITH MUSCLE AMERICAN LEADERS TO GO TO THE THE THE GOOD WATER AND AND MEET WITH THE SICK AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ANY BETTER -- AND I KNOW WE'VE COMMITTEE PROSECUTORS ENTRANCE OF ONLINE PROSECUTORS ARE MAKING THE CHARGES ISSUES THAT ARE PROCESSING THE CASE AS TO WHAT EXTENT HAVE FALLEN AND EITHER COUNTY. ON THE ACTUALLY GOING TO EITHER TRAINING OR INTERACTING WITH THE COMMUNITY OUTSIDE AGAIN OF THE PROSECUTORS ARE PROCESS OR ANY PROSECUTOR. OSCARS BRING FOLKS TO BRING INFORMATION TO THEM SO. JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE GROUND LEVEL LESSER FIRST SAY THAT. I THINK THE WEEK AND DO BETTER SANTA CORRECTLY IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE COMMUNITY. AT LANGUAGES OUR MORE THAN WE CAN COUNT MORE THAN THE PEOPLE ROOM OR THE NUMBER OF LANGUAGES LOOKING IT'S A CLARA COUNTY. IT'S A CONSTITUENT CHALLENGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE SENT TO ALL THE DIFFERENT. KINDS OF GROUPS WITHIN COUNTY. HE CRIED INPUT -- ONE PHASE WE TRIED TO DEAL WITH IT IN ANY CASE THAT HAS ANY PART THAT MIGHT RELATE TO A HATE CRIME. THAT WAS TO ACTUALLY AT THAT I SUPERVISE. SET WERE MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE. IN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE EIGHT UP ON ALL THE CRAP LAW. INSPECTORS AND I ARE OF A WITNESS OFF WE ALL -- HOW? ARE. HAVE BIAS TRAINING ON A REGULAR BASIS AS A SET BY A STREAKING WE ALSO DO YOU HAVE AS YOU KNOW IT THAT SPECIALIZE. IN HATE I AM AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE SET YEARS BACK A LIST OF ALL IN HOTLINE. AT WE ARE. AT THE HEARING SANTA CLARA CAN WE START MORE WORK WIDGET THAT CAN THEY CAN BE PLANTED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. AND THEY ARE VERY -- CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN. PEOPLE WHO CAN WORK IT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES WITH THOSE WHO CALL IN. THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE UP THE COMPLAINANT MAY NOT A SISTER RIGHT THE LEVEL OF A CRIME. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T SITTING ON A TENSION APPELLEE FOCUSED. ON HOW. THE MATTER CAN BE A BEST. I DON'T BELIEVE THE COURT. AND PROSECUTION NECESSARILY THE RIGHT. FOR EVERY INCIDENT. INVOLVES JUVENILES OR ADULTS ESPECIALLY IN THE JUVENILE SETTING. AT TIMES THERE CAN BE A MORE REALISTIC IT -- WAY TO WHICH THE SITUATION THAT. YOUR EVERYBODY NOT JUST THE PERSON WHO'S BEING BULLIED BUT AS YOU SAID. THE PERSON HIS ACTUALLY MAYBE. TAKING THE CHECKS AND GOING TO THE BILL ARE GOING TO THE CENTER OF THE AFTER MAKE ME CENTERS AND YOU GET TO THAT UPDATE I KNOW HOW BUSY EVERYBODY IS. THE MAYBE YOU KNOW OF A ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS -- ONCE A QUARTER ADDED SOME SPECIAL TYPE OF VIBE VISIT JUST TO GET THEM THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE I THINK I MAY SECURITY PEOPLE. I'M A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE BUT OTHERWISE I DO APPRECIATE SENSITIVITY TO WORK THAT YOU HAVE DOINGS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANKS TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER CAR. SEARCH VITA COMMITTEE SEE I JUST. IN TWO SEPARATE YOU BRING. SOME OF THE GROUND BUT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN OUR OPENING COMMENTS THANK YOU FOR THE DO A RIGHT TO CHÁVEZ. PRESS ALL RIGHT GREAT. EACH OWN WHAT WERE. THE TO BRING THIS TAKEN. US UP ON THE DAY AREAS. BUT BEFORE I DO THAT WATER RECOGNIZED -- SENATOR FROM SENATOR JIM BELL'S OFFICE JONAS AND SS. AND ALSO I'M OUR BOOK CAN WE GO BACK TO THE ACTUAL BILL. WHAT'S OTHER NAMES ON THE PANELISTS NAME. WHO WHO WHO'S CONTROLLING THEIR AGO OKAY SO DO PAULA THROUGH WAS ASKED TO OF? THOSE I DON'T KNOW IF. ANY PROTECT THE ALL DAY YOU HAVE WORK -- I THINK WE'RE SETTING THE ORDER THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEECH AND SITTING ON THE ORDER OKAY SO AWARE OF ROAD JUST -- HI MARKS. FOR SPEAKER. SO I WANTED TO BEGIN BY THANKING EVERYONE FOR HOLDING -- THIS SADDAM THIS HEARING AND ESPECIALLY THANKED THEM ALL FOR DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB IN ORGANIZING US -- YOU KNOW A THAT A LOT OF DEALINGS WITH HER AT NIGHT. WHEN I LOOK AT THE NUMBER THAT ARE SPEAKING ON THE PANEL? AND OTHER PANELS AS WELL I'M SURE THAT IT WAS A HUGE F. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR OF TOPICS AND ONE IS TRENDS AND ANOTHER -- ON OF OF PREVENTION OR WHERE OR HOW DO WE HOW TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES I'M SPEAKING. ON THE AMERICAN LOOK BLOOM ALL POPULATION I WANT TO BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT FRIENDS BY TALK FIRST ABOUT THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT MOST AMERICANS FIND SELVES AND IF YOU THE EDGE OF THE POOL PLAYER OUT THERE ON AMERICAN PUBLIC SENTIMENT TOWARDS MUSLIMS. OUT OF IT. IT'S GONE FROM TO WORKS -- QUITE FRANKLY AND WHAT WE KNOW THAT THE NUMBERS ARE TRUE BECAUSE THE ROLE IN AS A AS HUBS DID THE ISSUE AT THE OLD REINFORCE EACH OTHER -- THAT THE WHAT THE ONES THAT I WANT TO MENTION AT THE ONE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IN PUPIL WHEN THEY LOOK TO AND ASKED AMERICANS ABOUT THEIR SENTENCE STORE DIFFERENT. OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS MUSLIMS DID FORTUNATELY. WORST -- AND SOME OF THE VIEWS THAT RESONATES WITH AMERICAN VALUES OF OR YOU CAN SEE ARE PROBABLY NEGATIVE ON THE SENATE THIS. RES PATIENT TO YOU AS YOU KNOW AS FAR AS PART OF THE TESTIMONY. OFF THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NOTING A PERSON WHO IS A MUSLIM TENSED IMPROVED PERCEPTION IS ABOUT THEM AND THAT'S DOUBLY IMPORTANT TO OUGHT TO KNOW. SOURCE TO THE NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS I WOULD SAY ISLAMOPHOBIA PROBABLY OF IS ON THE TOP THE LIST ISLAMOPHOBIA IS THE IRRATIONAL FEAR THAT THE AMERICANS. HAVE OF OF OF MUSLIMS OF AND IT'S NOT JUST HOPPING A NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS. ON A FOUR BILLS NOW HAS BECOME AN INDUSTRY. IS A HAVE A FUNDED. OVER A HUNDRED BILLION OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HEAVILY FUNDED TO IF YOU HAVE A HANDFUL OF A VISUALS. ARE PRODUCING VITRIOLIC INFORMATION ABOUT MUSLIMS IN A SMALL. IS BEING PUT OUT ON ON NEWS CHANNELS IS BEING PUT OUT THROUGH A POLITICIAN'S THROUGH PUNDITS. THROUGH BOOKS THAT ARE BEING WRITTEN ABOUT MUSCLE. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF ISLAMOPHOBIA. IRRATIONAL FEAR THAT MANY AMERICANS HAVE IMMIGRATION RESULT AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE IS OF COURSE HARASSMENT AND BULLYING OF MY CHILDREN. IN THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS A STUDY -- AND DO IT EVERY YEAR AND IT SHOWED THAT CLEARLY THAT OF THAT SOME AMERICAN STUDENTS -- EXPERIENCE OF OF BULLY EXTENSIVELY ONE OUT OF TWO OF MUSLIMS IN CHILDREN AND THIS BUILDING IN SCHOOLS IN. HARASSMENT ENTITIES OR IN -- IN SOME FORM AND IT'S AND WORSE UP SINCE THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. ANOTHER UP AND THAT'S WHEN CONSEQUENCE OF THE POLITICAL AND WHEN IT IS A FEELING ASHAMED AND CURRENT EVENT DISCUSSIONS. UP IN WHICH IS WHICH IS GETTING OUT FIRST THAT WAY THAT THAT THAT FEATURE FRAME CONVERSATION. OF IN IN THE FRAME OF US FOR THAT. THE MOST ARE USED VIEWED AS THE ENEMY. OF DISABILITY LACKING SENSITIVITY TOWARDS THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE KIDS ACT HAVE RELATIVES OF THE PALM TREES AT THAT. ARE THE TEACHERS ARE TALKING ABOUT. THEN ALL POINTING TO BUT MOST KEVIN ASKING THEM TO BE BOMB THE EXPERTS ON SOD ON THESE ISSUES. OF THIRD CONSEQUENCE IS JUST. CONFIRM THAT ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY. IT BECOMES EVEN ARE BECOMES EVEN WORSE. I DO FOLKS ON THE REMEDIES HOW YOU DO YOU TURN THIS AROUND TO FOSTER INCLUSION PREVENT BULLYING OF SOME SORT. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT EFFORTS TO FOCUS ON EFFECT I THINK 8090% OF OUR APPROACH BE ON THE IN THE SPACE. OF THE GATES THE ASSISTANT DA TALKING ABOUT TREATING THAT THEY DO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CARL I'LL TALK TO VOTE. THEM AT THE BASE OF THE SPENDING WITH THE COMMUNITY IN ADDITION TO WHAT HE RECOMMENDED I THINK THAT IT'S ALSO. GO OUT WITH WHEN THEY DO TRAINING IN THE SCHOOLS HOW MOST OR ARAB REPRESENTATIVE OF A SIKH REPRESENTATIVE -- AFRICAN AMERICAN AND SO FORTH I WOULD REALLY. RECOMMEND THAT SCHOOL POLICIES IT CREDIBLY -- IMPORTANT YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THE LAWS ARE IN. THE NEED FOR FORMAL ANTI BULLYING PROGRAM I WAS TO HEAR ABOUT GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNS BEING ON A BILL I THINK IT'S A. B. TWO TWO NINE ONE DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT BURKE -- BETTER THE OTHER PLAYERS THAT AT THE SEAT EITHER AT THE CULT. EDUCATION UPPER RIGHT ENTITLING OUT BEING A TO ALSO PROVIDE SOURCES. OF THAT A TEACHER MIGHT MIGHT USE. OF THERE ARE MURPHY'S AT THAT SCHOOL TEACH -- OF MIGHT WORK TO PREVENT BULLYING WE DO A LOT OF EDUCATION OR TRAINING AS DO A LOT OF STUDENTS EDUCATION IN WHY EDUCATION BECAUSE CREDIT REPORT. SO I'M SCARED A BUNCH OF SLIDES AND GO INTO THE IMPORTANCE. ENHANCING EDUCATOR UNDERSTANDING OF MOST STUDENT PROGRAMS ADDRESSING COMMON CONCEPTION. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR MUSLIMS A LOT OF A LOT OF THE SOURCES OF PULLING COMES WITH THE FACT THEY DON'T SHOW. UP AT BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THIS TOO SAID THEY'RE DEALING WITH AND THEN HE SORT DOES FOR EDUCATORS WHICH BUT MY ORGANIZATION REALLY. DESPISES THAT. WE HAVE OF AS SPEAKERS BUREAUS. HELLO OF FIRST AMENDMENT CENTER GOT IT LINES THAT HAVE TO DO IT SWORE TO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW. I AM ISLAM HOW TO TALK ABOUT. THE ISM HINDI EMUS.

WHO CAN BE PREVENT THAT SO THAT'S GREAT -- LOWELL. LOVE TO HAVE YOUR SLIGHT UNTIL WE MAY BE ABLE TO INCLUDED AND ON MY WEBSITE. OR SOMETHING GRAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEREFORE HAVE DIANE. M. FISHER EACH DAY THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING ME TOO AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH TO YOUR SURPRISE. SO JUST ONE ADDRESS THE ATMOSPHERE FOR STARTERS OF WHAT OUR KIDS ARE LIVING IN. ON THIS LAST WEEK WE SIDE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF OVERT ANTISEMITISM THE PUBLIC'S TO THOSE OF US WORKING. OUR DEMOCRACY. HE ACCUSED GEORGE SOROS OF PAYING THE COVEN OF PROTESTERS AND I'D ROUTE JULIE ANNE CALLING STRESS ANTI CHRIST. SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO PULL THE REASON PROTESTERS IS ME PONDS ORCHESTRATED BY A SINGLE JUST PUSH PERSON. THEN WE HAD WHITE NATIONALIST TRIBUTE FLYERS AT UC DAVIS UC BERKELEY. AT BLAMED USE FOR ORCHESTRATING ALLEGATIONS AND CABIN ON THE FLYERS AND EVERY TIME THEM TO WHAT EIGHTEEN ANTI AMERICAN ANTI AMERICAN TAKES PLACE LOOK AT IT. AND IT'S CHOOSE. NINE SO UNFORTUNATELY HOUSE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND GROUPS LIKE THE DAILY STORMER THAT ARE USED AGE OLD STICK TYPES OF JEWS BEING. OUTSIDE AGITATORS -- IN THIS IS NOT ONLY HOPE. TO THE DUTY COMMUNITY ON THIS IS HURTFUL TO ALL THE GROUPS THIS PANEL AND IT'S HURTFUL THAT ANYONE WORKING FOR SOCIAL CHANGE RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S A STRATEGY IS A STRATEGY THAT'S TO DIVIDE US. TO YOU THE ANTI SEMITISM AS A TOOL AGAINST PROGRESSIVE IDEAS. FROM IT SEEKS TO ESTABLISH AN ASSUMPTION THAT. AMERICANS HERE TOGETHER CAN REJECT HIS CONSPIRACY THEORY AND WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. TO ASSERT OUR POINT. OF THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND THIS IS WHAT I REALLY WANT TO GET SET TO WHAT AND SHE DID BECAUSE PUT OUT AN AUTUMN AND MUCH. SHE HATED STATEMENT CAN DO BEING THAT ANTI SEMITIC FLYERS ACTIVIST IN BERKELEY AND IT SHOWS THAT WE WILL BE DIVIDED AMONGST OURSELVES [INAUDIBLE] THANKS. SO WHEN I SEEN IN OUR SCHOOLS WITH RESPECT TO ANTI SEMITISM WEAPONS SCENE IS NAY EAT KIDS. UP ON THESE OR ANTI SEMITIC STATE TYPE FROM THE PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT. I SAY THAT BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE PARENTS OF SOME OF THESE KIDS WHO'VE BEEN PERPETRATORS. THEY'VE CLEARLY TRIED TO RAISE THEIR KIDS WITH. THESE APPS BUT FOR ALL PEOPLE AND THE POOR IF THE WORK WITH THEIR KIDS ARE BIG ENOUGH AND HOW THEY ARE EXPERTS IN THIS THESE HOSTILITIES. THAT'S WHY THIS PUBLIC CONVERSATION SEVEN PORTENT ON BECAUSE WE TO NOT ONLY WORK TOGETHER BUT WE WANT TO SEE THE PUBLIC. SEEING US WORK OUT THERE AND SEE WHAT KIDS CAN PICK UP ON A DIFFERENT NARRATIVE. THE MOST RECENT -- INTO SUBMIT STUDENT INCIDENT THAT I'VE WHERE OF AS LS GET AS HIGH SCHOOL YOU MAKE THE CALL -- LESTER LOOKS GET AS I PUT IN A NEW PROGRAM A CONTRACTED THROUGH EDUCATION WHICH WAS RESPONSE TO SOME RACES PROM POSE RULES FROM THE YEAR BEFORE. AN EPIC EDUCATION TEACHES STUDENTS INTERN IN REPAIR R. I. R.. FOR RECOGNIZE INTERRUPTING AND PAIRING MICRO SESSION THAT HAPPENED RIGHT AND THIS IS A REAL HARD FOR STUDENTS TO DO IT'S HARD FOR IT ADULTS DO -- THEY WORKED ON THE LINE AND THEN A GROUP OF STUDENTS AND PUT TOGETHER MISSION STATE ABOUT SCHOOL STATING. QUOTE FROM IT ALL STUDENTS WILL CONFRONT ALL DISCRIMINATE BEEN OR DISCRIMINATORY SPEECH WILL TREAT OTHERS WITH COMPASSION AND STATE THAT FOR PEERS YOU MAY BE EXPERIENCING DISCRIMINATION. WILL HAVE TO INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE JOIN US AT THE PORT OF THIS AND AND SO I THEIR MISSION STATEMENT AND MODIFIED IT CAN REALLY MAKE A STATEMENT IN A POST. AT THE JCC WHERE I WORK AND I GOT CHURCHES IN THE TOWN MEDIUM AND MANY PEOPLE AROUND. THE PUBLIC THAT AS A PLEDGE THAT KIDS NINE RATE AND THIS YEAR THE SCHOOL THAT POSTER IN EVERY SINGLE CLASSROOM. HERE'S THE THING STATEMENT OF INTENT ENDS. AS IMPORTANT FIRST RATE WE HONOR THE ACTUAL PRACTICE OF INTERRUPTING DISCRIMINATION. IS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND MESSY PROPOSITION. WHEN SCHOOL STARTED THIS YEAR IN THE CLASSROOM RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT'S LOVELY POSTER? AT OTHERWISE DECENT STUDENTS THERE TO HER SING A JEWISH STUDENT HE PICKED UP THE OLD TROPES AND JEWS MANY. A BUCKET OF COINS IN FRONT JEWISH STUDENT FACE AND SAID -- YOU PASS THE TEST AND IT KEPT MESSING POINTS TOWARDS HER AND HARASSING HER IMPLYING. WE SLEEP WRONG KIND BASSMAN. JUST LIKE IT WAS -- DISCRIMINATE THAT THIS DOES IS HIS PARENTS CAME HERE FROM THE FORMER SOVIET UNION ESCAPING RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION AND HERE IN AMERICA SHE WAS EXPERIENCING THAT. IT SOME POACHING FOR THE STUDENT. BREAK UP TO THE FOUR END REPORTED TO HER ADMINISTRATION BUT I REALLY WANT TO GIVE KUDOS TO LET'S GET TIES WITH MINISTRATION HOW WE RESPONDED BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE. FROM AT EDUCATION INCLUDES SIX OUR INTERACTIVE ONLINE EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT EXPLAINS AND SIT BACK AND IT HAS TO SAY AS FOR UNDERSTANDING YOUR OWN BIAS. AND THINKING ABOUT CHANGING THEM WAS DEAD OF A JUST A NEW DIRECTION OF KICKING THIS KID OUT OF THE BILLY SEES THE TEACHABLE MOMENT -- AND HOPEFULLY MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT STUDENTS THINKING SO. QUICKLY GIVE TO PROPOSE BILLS TO PAY FOR OUR COUNTY OR STATE TO CONSIDER AND WHAT IS THE TO SET A GOAL FOR EVERY SCHOOL TO HAVE KIND OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OPPORTUNITY -- IN TO TEACH STUDENTS WHO COMMIT BOWLING SO OPTION WHERE THEY'RE YOU KNOW PREACHING TO THE CHOIR BUT IF WE TARGET OR FUNDS IN OUR EFFORTS TO REACH. THOSE KIDS WHO NEED EXTRA THING I BELIEVE WOULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT AND THAT THEY WANT TO RAISE UP IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH IT. A SERVICE. IS A CONFIDENTIAL SURVEY THAT SCHOOL AND PERFORM -- ABOUT. WILL CLIMATE AND SAFETY AND HOW KIDS FEEL. JUST THAT GET ON THE BACK IS PRETTY TEENAGE ASIANS THAT THEY GET THE MONEY TO DO THIS SURVEY AND MAYBE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE LAST WEB GADDIS HAVE ANY. BUT A LOT OF PLACES DON'T DO THIS AND WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA THAT REFLECTS THE PERCEPTION OF THE STUDENTS A PARTICULAR STUDENTS OF DIFFERENT RAY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SO I WITH FORD HEARING FROM OUR EDUCATORS ON WHAT THEY THINK IT.

HELLO THE YOU GUYS RAVENOUS MY NAME IS VIA HIS ARM ESTIMATES AND TM YET HERE AT RIVER LET ME IN OUR SCHOOL AND ASK STUDENTS WHO ARE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCES. FIRSTHAND -- WE KINDA WANT TO ADDRESS THE THE KIND OF THE INSIDE IS AMONG THE SCHOOL MONDAY FEATURES IN THIS INSTANCE. AND HAVE -- WE ARE NOT INFORMED THAT WE NEED TO BE MORE AWARE OF LIKE EVERYTHING WE'RE GOING THROUGH IN PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AT NO YOU HAVE BROUGHT SOME SOLUTION THAT. WE CAN PROVIDE YOU. OKAY SO WHAT THIS WILL DO IS WE ABOUT WAS AXE. WHITE -- PROPOSING MAYBE LIKE I'VE STUDIED CAUGHT IS A LOT OF WHAT WE SEE ARE CORRECT FORM IN. HOST TRACK AND THEN ABOUT AND DOING AND OR A NEW KIND OF PUSHING THAT. I WANTED IT DONE ABOUT AGENDA -- DO A VERY MAJOR DISSERVICE TO OUR NUCLEAR DIVERSE POPULATION OF WANT TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO SOMETHING I WANT TO BE ABLE -- TO YEAH I JUST BE EASIER TO FOCUS AND I WERE REALLY SOMETHING AND UP [INAUDIBLE] GOD. ANOTHER WAY THAT LIKE WE THOUGHT WE COULD DO THIS IS THAT. SINCE I IN ANOTHER CLASSMATE WE ACTUALLY ARE SOPHOMORE YEAR WELL THAT WAS IT. GROUP THAT TEENAGE OF A TEEN IMMUNITY IS SO HE ADDED FORM. AND WITH THIS WE WANT TO CREATE LIKE UNITY WHERE HE WHERE A LITTLE LIKE. US STUDENTS KID COME IT WILL COME BULLET AND KNOW THEIR PLACE FOR THEM BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL IS ABOUT 40%. STUDENTS OR WE THAT AND NO UNION. ONE OF MY YEARS FROM. ABOUT IT ME. AND I THINK IT WAS DECIDED IF YOU ABOUT IT BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS. THE THING THEY DO MANY OTHER THAN THE ENGINE. WELL OUR COUNTRY AND TO OTHER COUNTRIES. WITH THE KIND OF WHEN YOUR BOOKS THEY MORE COOL BY THE U. S. YOU DON'T REALLY HERE THE TIRES STORY. SO WHEN I GOT TO MY FRESHMAN YEAR LIKE ALL THESE STORIES UNLIKE. SITE OTHER STREET KNOW ABOUT. THE PRICE I KNOW ALL THESE FACTS I'D EVEN HEARD OF BEFORE BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT ARE HERE THREE BOOKS AND ROTISSERIE WHICH RECALL WHICH THE SEEDS THAT HAVE THE ROLE JUST TO DO WITH THE U. S.. BASE THE ONLY TALK ABOUT THE U. S. ASIDE AND WHAT THE U. S. FOR THEM. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA OF ETHNICS IS SO MORE PEOPLE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR CULTURE AND THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THEIR CULTURE BECAUSE EITHER. THEIR PARENTS -- HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED TO THEM IT THINK OR FOR OTHER REASONS THEY OKAY -- THINK THAT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS IS NOT ONLY LIKE THE STUDENTS THE MORNING BE MORE ACTIVE WHERE OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON WITH THAT BALEEN BUT ALSO THE TEACHER IS -- PUT INTO BEEN IMPRIMER EFFORT WE'VE HAD. UP MAKE MINCE LAKE -- I DON'T NEXT IN AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND I THINK THIS STARTING WITH. IT MAKES THE STUDENTS THINK IT'S OKAY -- I HAVE FOR THEM TO STAY REMARKS LIKE JUST AS THEY HAVE -- BASICALLY PEOPLE THEY'RE LOOKING UP TO AND THE ONE THAT. SAVES THING SO IT'S A THING TO JUST CHANGE THE STUDENTS BUT ALSO THE TEACHERS. THAT NOT ONLY THAT IT LIKE IT'S IT'S RIGHT THE T. TO KNOW HOW TO ACT THIS WAY BUT SO THIS IS FOR ME COMFORTABLE AND LIKE. RIP. AND THE THAT LATE IF THE REPORT IT LIKE. SOMETHING GOING TO BE DONE AND THAT IT'S NOT AS WE SEE IN THEIR VOICE NOT ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT. ALSO -- I FEEL THAT TEACHERS NEED MORE TRAINING ON HOW TO BE ABLE TO DO. IT WAYS THE FIRST ONES AND FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I CAN SAY THAT UP IN THE SEAT I AND THAT REALLY. WORKS -- WAY IN WHICH I WILL LEARN BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT SUPPORT SO I'M NOT [INAUDIBLE] I THOUGHT. ORANGE ASK GIN AND DOES. AND A MEANS I THINK THAT'S JUST AND OKAY I'M ON ANOTHER SMALL CHANGE OF TOPIC I ALSO WANTED A DOES THE FACT OF GIN BASED RULES IN SCHOOL WAY BE. LOOK AT WHAT. ROSE IS BUOYED.

CHIU TH QUEUE FOR TENTATIVE COME -- AND ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. MY NAME IS MATT CAMPBELL THE DIRECT STUDENT BUT SIR IS A NON BEING OF OUR SUPER. DOC CAME OFF AS WE ARE ON TO PRESENT TO YOU WE DO AT SCHOOL BACK. I WANTED TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND IS OF WE DO I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD OF THE PANELIST COOL. THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX OUT STUDENTS AND SO IT'S A PRETTY DIVERSE BASED ON ONE CALENDAR THAT WE HAD IN TERMS OF WHEN STUDENTS REPORTED CLEAN. A MOP FOR RESPONSIBILITY MY FOR POSSIBILITY MATIC WAS TO TRY TO CREATE A SYSTEM. TERMS OF TWO EIGHT FIVE THE DISTANCE OF A AS A COMMON RESPONSE. SO. BUT I HAD TO DO IF POSSIBLE KNOW THAT -- I'VE BEEN WORKING IF -- THIS JUMP OVER HERE WE CREATED. A RESPONSE REPORT AND N. F. BUTTON ABOUT THIS I'M REALLY REALLY AUTUMN WE DONE BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHAT. STUDENT PORTS LEAN -- THE FONTS IS IT GOING TO BE THE SAME -- WHAT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE WE'VE A LOT TIME DEVELOPED IN THIS SYSTEM? AND COMMUNICATED PROVIDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SO WHEN THE WE TALK ABOUT BEING SAFE. AT THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHEN PLANE AS REPORTED WHEN SOMEBODY HAS THE COURAGE TO COME PORTER PORTER THEN WHAT HAPPENS. I CAN TELL YOU THIS AS A PARENT. I EXPERIENCE THIS THAT I OWN AND EXPERIENCE SOME BOWLING AND I WAS SHOCKED AT THE LACK OF RESPONSE IN TERMS OF WHAT CAN BACK ME. SO I CAN TELL YOU IN FACTLY AT IN FREMONT IF A STUDENT OR A CHILD OR A PARENT OF REPORTS BULLYING. THIS POWER ARE GOING TO THE PROCESS AND FROM WHAT WE SO THE IN FRONT VIEW IS. ARE SAMPLING SOME A RESPONSE FROM AN IS USED IS YOU CAN SEE EVERY SCHOOLS IN SO AND EVERY ADMIN STRAIGHTER AS THE LINK TO THIS. SPECIFIC FORM. THAN IF IT'S OUT THERE FOR A PARENT FOR REPORTS PULLING THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION KNOWS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY HAVE TO INITIATE A PORT INITIATE IN THAT CATION. SO YOU SEE THERE'S A DROP DOWN MENU UP TOP THERE'S ALL TOOLS THAT ARE LISTED THERE. AND THAT ITS PURPOSE FOR THE IS AT THE END OF EVERY AT THE END OF EVERY SEMESTER I GIVE A REPORT. STRAIGHTER FROM THEIR PROJECT THEIR SCHOOL SITES IN THE HAITIAN THE DATE THE INS AND OUTS OF THE AND THE IN. AN ODD LOOKING IN. ABOUT CALLED THE ALLEGED VICTIM BUT WE STARTED WITH THE NAME OF THE PERSON THAT'S FINE THE COMPLAINT. I DIDN'T OR AND THE RAID LOOK OF THE COMPLAINT THE WHEN YOU KEEP GOING. FURTHER. THAN WE HAVE MISSION ABOUT THE RESPONSE IN THE WRIST AND IS THE SENATE IS RESPONSE -- TO THE ALLEGATION. SO THEN WHAT IS THE LEVEL THE REST AND AND SO IF YOU KEEP GOING THEN THEN WE CAN HAVE SOME COMPARISON DATA. SO. AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS THE SUMMARY OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT. AND AND WE HAVE TRAINED APARTMENT TRADER ON AND THE PROFESSIONALS AND THEY CONDUCT INVESTIGATION WANTED TO COMPILE ODES HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS. AN DAY NOW THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT BERMAN NAY AND WAS THIS BOWLING INCIDENT BASED ON PROTECTED ASSETS THE IN THERE IT IS YES. THEM DOWN THE OTHERS OF FEDERAL ACTED AS IS -- AND THEN IT JUST BOX AGAIN THAT'S REALLY REALLY FOR THE NOTE. IT IS WHO WHO IN OUR DISTRICT IS IS -- ON THE THEN THE THE PRINCIPAL NOTE THAT THE PARENT C. R. U. C. P. ARE YOU ONE COMPANY PROCESS AND BECAUSE AND WRITE IT WANT TO FILE. A FORMAL COMPLAINT IF THERE ARE DOUBLING INCIDENT BASED ON A PROTECTED CLASS. SO THEN AT THE END OF THAT THAT THEY'RE IN THE GATE THEY NEED TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. BASED ON THE REPORTED INCIDENT WHAT THEY CAN FIND OUT THROUGH THERE TO GET FINDINGS. IS IT YES OR NO AND THAT THE NATION. READ THE LIST OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S YET OR NOT. IS WHAT I AM REALLY PROUD ABOUT AND WHAT ARE IN THE SHAPE IS DUE. IF YOU WILL ON STROLLING. AND A ARE MINISTERS THE IN APP PLAN BELL ACTION PLAN TO ACT. DRESS THE BLAME. SO THERE IS A LIST OF VENTURE. WET THE SCHOOL HAS A CRISP BOLD TAKEN BACK IN OR ALL THAT APPLY WHAT THEY CAN IMPLEMENT AT THE TOOLS AND SO THEN YOU CAN SEE. A LOT LESS. IF YOU FONG UNINSTALLING OUR NEXT ONE IT WILL TO BE THE MACRO VIEW. TERMS -- YOU KNOW WITH THEIR OR SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE AND NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO AND THIS IS WHAT THEY CAN DO SCHOOL AND SO COUPON. BONDS BOWLING -- WHAT IS ACTION STEPS THEN THEY TURN AS AN M. TRADED TO PREVENTABLE IN? AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT THAT THERE IS A GOOD IDEA AND OVER IDEA. IS THAT IT SHOOTER CAN -- PUT INTO PLACE TO PREVENT THE BULLY. KEEP ON GOING. SO HOW DO WE REMEDY THE EFFECTS OF HER ASK FOR THE BOOK IN ON THE COMPLAINT OR THE STUDENT THAT IS BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF BELONGING. AND SO THEY CAN SEE YOU THERE. AT FIRST BALL IT RIGHT THERE SORT OF RECEIPT OR EMPLOYMENT RESTORE BACK IS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. ON THAT IT WOULD EVER SECONDARY LEVEL AND SO THEY CAN SEE WE CAN PROVIDE RESOURCES TO OUR CAR TEAM. AND AND ALL THE ACCOUNT SERVICES. THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE WERE EDUCATORS AND AND THE GENTLEMAN RIGHT DOCTOR BUT YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TO TEACH PEOPLE BEHAVIOR. OF ONE MORE ONE LAST THING TO KEEP CALLING. THE IS THE ACTION PLAN AND TO CARESS. ACTIONS OF THE RESPONDENT THOUGH WE COLUMN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS RAIDERS CAME AND BUT THEY'RE ALSO TO WITH. THE THE ACT OF THE OF THE RESPONDENT. SO WHAT WE WE TRY TO DO IT FROM A MORE THE FIRST LIVED UP WITH THEM PUNITIVE AND SO THE BOTTOM NOW WITH AREA IS -- IF THAT HAPPENS THE COVER THAT IMPRESSES PENSION MOTION. AND THEN. DOWN AT THE VERY BY. THIS IS. THAT -- THAT OUT. IS THAT IF THEY'RE GONNA AT THE FORM TO MEET AND I LOOK ONE UP. AT I THINK THAT. THE MISSING PIECE OF THAT SINCE STUDENTS OF OUR TALKED IT IS. WHEN SUIT REPORT SOMETHING LIKE? SOMETIMES I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING BUT IT DISTRICT THEY THEY HERE BECAUSE OUR THAT IS OUT THERE THE HOT LINK A HOWLING FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM -- THE THE PARENTS TRIED THE ADMIT AND IT'S A LETTER TO PARENTS. AND THAT THE SOFTWARE THE ACTION THAT THAT THE MINUTE OR TWO WHO UP UNTIL INVESTIGATE -- OUR MINISTRY DEAL WITH A LOT. AND IN PARTICULAR ASSET.

IN THE CITY -- IT WRITTEN A RESPOND TO IN. OR OF BILLY HARAP AND THAT IT TOWARD TECH BOMB PARENTS DO NOT HAVE TO REQUEST THAT IS AN AUTOMATIC USED TO BE AN OCCASION THAT BINS -- TANDEM AT THE SAME TIME THAT WILL SITE INVESTING INVESTIGATING ISSUE. I MEAN THE FAX THEM IN AND FROM. WHAT THE INVESTIGATION TURNS OVER THE NEXT STEP IS MAKE DECISIONS ON APPROPRIATE RESPONSES AND RESPONSES -- LAP WAS PREVIOUSLY STATED ISN'T JUST FOR A STUDENT WHO IS REPORTED TO HAVE IT'S A RESPONSE ON ANY HELP SUPPORT AND ENGINE. TO TEACH ME YEARS NOT ONLY TO BOMB. INITIAL COME TO TAKE YOU OVER THE AGE OF AUDI ACCOUNTABLE -- WE ALSO INSURE THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT. OF PEOPLE MARK -- AS UNITY I WAS AT THE ADDRESS HAS A COMMUNITY HOW CAN WE WORK. WITH DRESS BY IT RECENTLY HAVE TO SAY WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE A RESPONSIBILITY OF APPROPRIATE SUPPORTING STUDENTS. WHO ARE ON THE SUBJECT OF WHAT MAY BE MEMBER QUIRK CHOOSE THE BULLION AS A MINUTE WE HAVE TO MOVE BEYOND ENSURING OUR KIDS ARE COLLEGE AND CAREER READY? BUT ALSO MAKE THEM COMMUNITY READY. WE'RE NOT TAKING OUT WEAPONS AND TO THE COMMUNITY ARE PUSHING OUT TO ME. AND THIS INCLUDES TEACHING SUPPORT IMPROVEMENT ON SOCIAL MOTIONAL. ACCOMPLISH THESE HELPFUL ERNEST MANAGEMENT RELATIONSHIP SKILLS SOCIAL WELL AS A MATTER AS RISK SUBORDERS MAKE. I'M ALTHOUGH JEAN -- THESE COMMITTEES AS NATURAL BETTER PARENTING I THINK IMPORT SOME HELP TO DEVELOP THOSE COMPETENCIES FOR ME I CALL THEM OFF OUR L. THOSE ARE EXTRA LOVE KIDS. THOSE ARE KIDS BUT I'M NOT A STAFF HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE. TO ANAL ABOUT IT COMPETENCIES IN A TIER ONE FORMAT AND THEY NEED ONE ON ONE ATTENTION. TO IMPROVE TO BE EIGHT YEARS CANNOT KILL THE ISLAND FOR MAKE BAD CHOICES WE CAN ENSURE. THAT WE TEACH APPROACH BEHAVIORS AS WELL HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE -- AS A COMMUNITY OF THE TWO THAT WE GET A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT HEY IF YOURS ARE ON IT NOT INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS -- BILLION IS A COMPLEX ISSUE IT IS A COMPLEX RESPONSE THE RESPONSE AFTER KLUBI EIGHT AGE APPROPRIATE. WE CANNOT POLICE PRESSED PRESSED CHARGES OUT OF THIS WORK THIS IS WORK WE HAVE TO GET IN THE FOURTH ROUND UP. AFTER WORKING ON PREVENT AS WELL INTO INTERNET THE SAME EXACT TIME -- IN SHORT I'D SAY -- AS WE BILL CAPACITY ON OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THEY WILL LEAD THE WAY AND I I HAVE TO A POP EYES FOR JUST COMMUTE IN JANET FOR TO THE COMMUNITY IN GENERAL ON BEHALF. OF THE LOOK OF LEAVE WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY WILL NOW BE IT IS PERPETUATING THE TOP THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE TALKING. TONIGHT. GREEN [INAUDIBLE] VERY MUCH. BUT AT LEAST ONE OF THE HIM FROM THE OF PROJECT CORNER STORE. USE A MUCH AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE ON THIS PANEL ON THESE -- THE EDUCATORS THAT ARE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THEM TO SCHOOL CLUB MED AND EDUCATE THE WHOLE CHILD. OF THE PROJECT WAS DONE AS PART OF THE YMCA. SILICON VALLEY AND WE WORKED ALONG SIDE SCHOOLS PROVIDING THEM WITH TOOLS. THAT WILL HELP IN THE REALM OF PREVENTION AND I THINK THAT WE'VE THAT THEME -- CREATED IN CLIMATE. COMMITTING INCLUSIVE WE'RE BUILDING BILL VALUE RESPECTED IT NOW IS IMPORTANT. ALSO PROJECT CORNERS AS A BOND OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OUR PARTNERSHIP SCHOOLS HAVE EXPANDED TO TWO HUNDRED WILL REDWOOD CITY TO GO ALL RIGHT. AND OUR PREVENTION EFFORTS ARE ON TIME TO INCREASE. TO REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE. WHICH TO INCLUDE THE STAFF AND THEN LATER. YOU TRY INCLUDE STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE CRITICAL WE ALSO TRIED IN THE PAST. MOST OF OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN. READING PORT EARLY EDUCATION SO WE'LL BRING IN PRESCHOOL AND UP. INTO THE MIDDLE SCHOOL YEAR WE ONE THAT USES A CHILDREN'S BOOKS THAT BROUGHT IT THE CLASSROOM EVERY MONTH. AND THOSE. WE HAVE TRAINED OVER FIFTY FIVE PARENTS TO BRING THOSE BOOKS. IN TWO ON IN ELEMENTARY PRE K. CALL ROOMS -- LEADING PROCESS FROM THE BOOKS THAT ARE EMPATHY ABOUT COM RESOLUTION ABOUT PROBLEM SOLVED THING. ABOUT OF A BYSTANDER PULLING SITUATION. OF THE CURRICULUM IS AVAILABLE NOT ONLY IN ENGLISH BUT ALSO IN SPANISH -- SO THAT PARENTS WHO ARE MONOLINGUAL CAN GATE KNOW BALL CONNECTED -- IN THEIR CHURCH AND SCHOOL IT UP. FOR V. -- THE FRIENDS WHO ARE VOLUNTEERING WITH US OR ARE AND ENHANCING THE CARRYING SCHOOL CLIMATE THAT THIS TOPIC STRAIGHTER CREATING AND THEY'RE THEY'RE CRITICAL THERE ON THE FRONT. AND THE STUDENTS ARE REALLY HAVING A CANCER THE LESSON. TO TO PRACTICE I'M I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED ALL THIS -- WHEN PREVENTION RESEARCH THAT WE CAN'T EXPECT KIDS OR ADULTS TO DISTANCE TING WE KNOW HOW TO ACT IN RESPONSE ATTITUDE EIGHT THEY? GET A CHANCE TO BE -- AN ARM TOP AND ENTERPRISE. ROLE PLAYS -- IN THREE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES STONE BY BETTING THAT INTO -- INTO OUR SENSE OF THE KIDS -- BILL IN THE VOCABULARY AND BEFORE BEING FIRST AND BY HAVING PARENTS AND GAPED AND TM LESS THAN IT ALSO BEING BROUGHT BACK INTO THE HOME ENVIRONMENT AS WELL. WE HAVE ANOTHER COMPONENT CALLED A RESPECT. KIDS THE CHANCE -- TO IN A FIRE SO WE'VE HEARD ALLEN LEAVE FROM THIS THE YOU WERE SITTING IN THESE RECEIPTS. OTHER ONES EXPERT EVERYDAY PROBLEM. SO FOR THEM TO BE. OF A SAFE PLACE TO ARTICULATE WHAT IS HAPPENING AND THAT COULD BE A LEAD CHANGE SO THAT IT COULD BE DIFFERENT. ARE SO EXPECT RESPECT PROGRAM TAKE A WITHIN A SCHOOL FOR FIFTY KEY INFLUENCERS -- OF THE STUDENT POPULATION LEASED PER WORKSHOP OR THERE I DON'T MIND THIS HAPPENING ON THEIR CAMPUS. THEY ARE THEN -- SOME STRATEGIES AND DEVELOP ACTIONS AND IS THEN CARRIED OUT OVER THE REST OF THE YEAR WITH THE SUPPORT OF COAST OFF AS WELL AS WITH. THE SUPPORT OF PARENTS NICK TODAY. AND THOSE LEADERSHIP SKILLS ARE SO IMPORTANT AND OUT. SHINGLE FROM THE MOTION BILLS AT EARLY AGE -- THOUGH AND UP A LITTLE SAMPLE OF SCUTTLE THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM THEY WERE USING UP A HOW TO RECOGNIZE HER UP AND REPAIR MICROGRAPHS AND BRING THE COURAGE TO DO THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IS DISTANCING TO LIKE. TO KNOW WHAT THEY CAN LEARN FROM THE THE TOOL AND A CAT VERY. WRECKING HIS INTERRUPT ADDRESS FROM THE DROP. FIVE ALL THE WAY UNTIL THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL. MORE LIKELY TO BE A PHONE YEARS WE TO DO.
