GREAT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR I COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M PRESENTING SENATE BILL EIGHT THIRTY FOUR. WHICH WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD- BASED ON RECOMMENDATION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE AUTHORITY- TO REVOKE THE TAX EXEMPT STATUS OF NONPROFITS- THAT IN THAT IT- EITHER ENGAGE CHEN OR INSIGHT ACTIVITY TO OVERTHROW OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OR THE GOVERNMENT OF ANY STATE THAT ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION. OR RELATED CRIMES- TO OVERTHROW OUR DEMOCRACY- ALTHOUGH UNDER EXISTING LAW UNDER COMMON LAW- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ALREADY EXISTS WE ALSO THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR IN STATUTE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAVE THIS- THORGY- THE I. BECAUSE WE ALL SAW WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY SIX OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WHEN WE HAD ARMED INSURRECTION S. WHO ATTEMPTED TO VIOLENTLY OVERTHROW. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO VIOLENTLY OVERTHROW OUR DEMOCRACY AND TO VIOLENTLY- PROVIDE- THE SEATING OF THE PRESIDENT THE DULY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. NEVER BEFORE HAPPENED IN OUR DEMOCRACY- AND WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. AND WE KNOW THAT TRAGICALLY THERE ARE NONPROFITS THAT ARE REGISTERED AS NONPROFITS WEATHER HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR ELSEWHERE- THAT. HELPED ENGAGE AN INSURRECTION INCITED- INSURRECTION AND WERE INVOLVED AND CONTINUE TO THIS DAY TO RAISE MONEY OFF OF THE NOTION OF VIOLENTLY OVERTHROWING THE U. S. GOVERNMENT. I'M PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA CAN WRITE CHECKS TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS AND WRITE OFF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS ON THEIR CALIFORNIA TAXES ARE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ARE LITERALLY SUBSIDIZING ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE SEEKING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND SO SB THIRTY FOUR WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD CAN PUT A STOP TO THAT CAN EITHER DENY OR REVOKE TAX EXEMPT STATUS IF THEY FIND- THAT- THESE NONPROFITS ARE ENGAGING IN THIS ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION FOR OUT OF STATE NONPROFIT SEEKING TO RAISE MONEY IN CALIFORNIA THEY NEED TO- UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW REGISTER WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DO THAT THEY CAN BE DENIED THAT REGISTRATION SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. ORGANIZATIONS RESULT ELSEWHERE WHO ARE RAISING MONEY TAX DEDUCTIBLE MONEY I HEAR IN CALIFORNIA- WE WORK VERY HARD. TO STRUCTURE THIS BILL I TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY- CONSTITUTIONAL AND CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY UNDERMINE FREE SPEECH PEOPLE CAN MAKE STATEMENTS THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE. BUT THIS IS ABOUT ORGANIZATION AND THAT ARE- EITHER ENGAGING IN OR INCITING INSURRECTION.

WIENER AYE WIENER HI THREE ZERO THREE TWO ZERO YOU'RE WINNING SO FAR BUT I THINK YOU NEED A FEW MORE VOTES SO WE'LL PUT IT ON CALL- ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN SKINNER. FLOOR'S YOURS. WELCOME. S. B. EIGHT FIFTY FOUR. I'M THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- PRESENTING. SB EIGHT FIFTY FOUR HOPE FOR CHILDREN AFTER AND I WANTED TO START FIRST WITH ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE- THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT ARE ONGOING COVERT NINETEEN PET PANDEMIC. HAS BEEN VERY DEVASTATING AND- MANY FAMILIES HAVE LOST LOVED ONES. AND IF YOU ARE A CHILD WHO LOST. AT THE END OF DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE ESTIMATION OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN LOST A PARENT OR PRIMARY CARE GIVER TO COPE IT AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE WE DON'T HAVE THE FULL DATA BUT THE MAJORITY WE KNOW OUR LOW THE PARENTS WERE LOW WAGE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. SO THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO IN SOME CASES WILL RECEIVE FEDERAL SURVIVOR BENEFITS UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY. ACT IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER IF YOU HAVE A WAGES THAT WERE QUALIFYING. THEN YOUR- YOUR SURVIVORS RECEIVE THOSE BENEFITS BUT IN MANY CASES A LOT OF THESE CHILDREN WILL NOT RECEIVE SUCH BENEFITS BECAUSE EITHER THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T WORK. IN A THE YPE OF WAGE DROP THE CONTRIBUTED TO THAT WERE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH QUARTERS OF THOSE WAGES. BUT ADDITIONALLY THESE CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HIT EIGHTEEN AND NOT HAVE PARENTS TO RELY ON SO WHILE MANY OF US DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE PARENTS THAT CAN SUPPORT US BEYOND EIGHTEEN. MANY OF US FOR AT LEAST IN THE SITUATION WHERE A PARENT COULD HELP US EITHER HELP US WITH OUR FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT. OR YOU KNOW COLLEGE YOUR PURCHASE A CAR OR WHAT HAVE YOU THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO WILL NOT. SO ARE WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ESTABLISH HOPE SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR THOSE CHILDREN. WITH A DEPOSIT OF POTENTIALLY UP TO FOUR K. FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE UP TO NINE YEARS OLD. AND UP TO EIGHT K. FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN TEN AND SEVENTEEN THE THEORY BEING THAT LASTS FOR THE CHILDREN WERE YOUNGER BECAUSE THESE WOULD BE PUT IN INTEREST BEARING ACCOUNTS AND IT WOULD GAIN VALUE OVER TIME. BUT ADDITIONALLY THESE HOPE SAVINGS ACCOUNT WOULD BE SET UP FOR CHILDREN OF LONG WHO ARE IN LONG TERM FOSTER CARE ON THE SAME THEORY THAT THEY ALSO DO NOT HAVE. FAMILIES TO RELY ON. AND RESEARCH ACROSS THE COUNTRY SHOWS THAT. CHILDREN WHO KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME SECURITY FOR THEM WHEN THEY HIT THAT INDEPENDENCE AGE. YOU MUCH BETTER IN LIFE- I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND WE'LL START WITH- IS IT A CODY OR YES CODEPEN FILLED IN FROM J. BAY AND A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU THE MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CODY I'M TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD REPRESENTING JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH AS A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. I REENTER FONG THERE RIGHT BEFORE MY SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY AFTER MY ADOPTIVE PARENTS ABANDONED ME AND I WAS LEFT WITH NOTHING. AFTER MY FOSTER PARENTS KICKED ME OUT OF THEIR HOME. I FACE MANY DIFFICULTIES. I DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR THE SERVICES OF EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SO I EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS MORE THAN ONCE. WHICH RESULTED IN TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. I FIRST STARTED COLLEGE A FEW MONTHS BEFORE MY EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY. I'VE BEEN GOING TO COLLEGE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. MAKING TWENTY TWENTY TWO MY SEVENTH YEAR IN COLLEGE. I WILL BE DONE WITH MY EDUCATION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. OR LATER MY SCHOOLING WAS EXTENDED BECAUSE OF THE DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES I FACED. MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP MY GRADES. FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH SB EIGHT FIVE FOUR WOULD HAVE PREVENTED ME FROM BECOMING HOMELESS AND IN SOME CASES THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES I SUFFERED THAT FOLLOWED WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. WELL MY PARENTS DID NOT PASS AWAY FROM GOLDEN NINETEEN I DID LOSE BOTH OF MY PARENTS ABRUPTLY AND BILL PASSED AWAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG. I'VE LOST PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT CAN BE TO NAVIGATE. YOUNG ADULT LIFE WITHOUT THE FINANCIAL EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL SUPPORT A FAMILY. ONE THING I WOULD LIKE POLICYMAKERS TO REMEMBER WHEN CONSIDERING SB EIGHT FIVE FOUR. IS THAT A WILL GIVE THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM THEM THIS MONEY IS THE FREEDOM TO ESCAPE TOXIC SITUATIONS. POVERTY GAPS AND SOME FOSTER HOMES WITH CARE GIVERS THAT SEEK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF CHILDREN YOUTH WHO'VE ALREADY LOST SO MUCH THIS MONEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN MY DEPARTURE FROM MY FOSTER CARE. ON MY OWN TERMS. WHEN I SEE THE BENEFITS OF SB EIGHT FIVE FOUR. COULD HAVE OFFERED ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD I SEE THE DEFINITION OF HOPE. WHICH IS WHY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SB EIGHT FIVE FOUR. PLEASE GIVE HOPE TO THE FOSTER YOUTH CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT THEY CAN AVOID SOME OF THE HEARTBREAK. AND TRAUMA THAT I EXPERIENCE. IS SO THAT THEY CAN PLAN FOR A BETTER TOMORROW I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND LISTENING TO MY STORY.

THE SENATOR SAID- THERE ARE. YOU CAN COUNTY CALIFORNIA THERE ARE FORTY MILLION OF POPULATION ONE POINT ARE VERY ACTIVE LET THEM NOT ARE. RETIRED VETERAN.

ANY OF THEM AREN'T RETIREES THEY DO THEIR FOUR YEARS THERE- TEN YEARS WHATEVER IT IS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY RETIRED SAYS IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A SMALLER NUMBER OF THOSE WHO WOULD BE. I'M BENEFITING FROM THIS AND I JUST THINK IT'S A- IT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO SHOW THEIR APPRECIATION FOR VETERANS IT IN IN THIS SMALL WAYS TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR- WILL CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. SENATORS CAPITO HERTZBERG.

WELCOME WELCOME WELCOME HOME UNDER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SECURE IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TO SEE CENTER DRIVE SO AND ACTUALLY CONSULTANT CANAL- IN THE- JONATHAN IN ANTON AND IT SELLS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE WITH- BE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR AND CENTER DRIVE SO- FIRST OF ALL MISTER I WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AS WELL AS THE INCREDIBLE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE STAFF TEAM ESPECIALLY ON ANY CHANGES TO THE LOCAL PLANNING LANGUAGE AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD OBVIOUSLY PERSON TO ME IN THIS COMMITTEE IS WILL BE WORKING A 100% UP WITH THE CHAIR IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES WHICH CANDIDLY I'M SURE THERE WILL BE. HERE AS THE BILL I WOULD SHALL BE HONORED IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO MOVE THIS FOR TODAY SO EIGHTY FOUR WOULD PROVIDE A PATH TO EXPEDITE UNDERGROUNDING OF ELECTRIC UTILITY LINES AND HIGHEST FIRE RISK ZONES THOSE LINES ARE MOST AT RISK AT STARTING A WILDFIRE. I DON'T WANT TO BE FLIPPED THIS BILL WILL TRULY SPLICE ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDER THE APPROACH THAT'S EMBEDDED IN THE LEGISLATION ITSELF GONNA SAVE RATEPAYERS MONEY SB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR WHILE ALSO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY STOPPING MEGA FIRES BEFORE THEY START WE KNOW THAT. UNDER BLINDS REDUCE FOR STARTS BY NINE. AND THIS LEGISLATION WILL HOLD ELECTRIC UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO THE TIMELINE FOR FAR TOO LONG YOU KNOW THIS AMERICA'S LARGEST UTILITY PG&amp;E HAS FAILED ITS CUSTOMERS AND MADE CALIFORNIA UNSAFE LITERALLY FOR YEARS THE UTILITIES UNDER FUNDED MODERNIZATION ABOUT FIRE SAFETY EFFORTS WHICH IS HAVE HAD DEVASTATING IMPACTS IN THE GOLDEN STATE. NOW THEY HAVE A NEW CEO AND SHE WANTS TO CHANGE THIS WHICH I'M GRATEFUL FOR WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CEO AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK. TO THE WOMEN IN MEN TELL THE WORKERS WITH P. GENIE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM AS WELL- AND KNOW THAT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE. CALIFORNIANS HAVE LITERALLY RUN FOR THEIR LIVES WHETHER HOMES BURNED TO ESCAPE PLANES FROM UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES. OTHERS WHO WERE UNABLE TO RUN. FIRST YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR THESE UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES HAVE CHARRED MILLIONS OF ACRES OF FOREST LAND IN LEVEL COMMUNITIES. GENERATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EQUAL TO MILLIONS OF VEHICLES ANNUALLY IN FACT IN TWENTY TWENTY THE SMOKE FROM FIRES GENERATE THE EQUIVALENT EMISSIONS OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION VEHICLES- AND BLANKETED MANY PARTS OF THE STATE WITH UNHEALTHY SMOKE. FOR WEEKS. CALIFORNIA SAT IN THE DARK WITH FOOD SWIMMING IN THE WARMER FRIEDRICH. FOR DAYS ON END DURIN WIND DRIVEN PUBLIC POWER SHUT OFFS IN THE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ACCESS TO CRITICAL LIFELINE SERVICES WHEN POWER LINES GO DOWN. THIS IS BEEN A REALITY MY OPINION THIS IS BEEN A REALITY. FOR FAR TOO LONG. FOR THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND WE CAN'T ACCEPT THIS WE CAN'T ACCEPT THIS AS WHAT OUR LIVES ARE GOING TO BE THERE IS A BETTER WAY WE MUST MOVE IT FORWARD AND CREATE A PATH FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE. SB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR WILL PROVIDE A PATH TO EXT. COUNTING OF TEN THOUSAND MILES A PG&amp;E LINES IN THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK ZONES CURRENTLY P. JEANNIE UNDERGROUND'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES OF THEIR ELECTRIC LINES ANYWAY SO HERE'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO AND I'LL BE QUICK THROUGH THE BULLET POINTS. IT MAY. IT MANDATE FOR METRICS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ON UNDERGROUNDING PROJECTS INCLUDING TIME LINES FOR COMPLETION. FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR NOT HAVING TIME LINES IN THE UTILITY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE SAFETY PROTOCOLS. ARE MET PRIOR TO RECEIVING A RATE OF THE RETURN. DEVELOPS AT THIS BILL DEVELOPS A PATHWAY TO EXPEDITE UNDERGROUNDING CONSTRUCTION BY STOP WISHING A SHOT CLOCK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THEY HAVE TO APPROVE OR DENY IT WITHIN A HUNDRED FIFTY DAIS. THE LEGISLATION WOULD SAVE RATEPAYERS MONEY WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY. THAT WOULD MANDATE UTILITIES USE AVAILABLE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT UNDERGROUNDING PROJECT BEFORE USING USING RATEPAYER FUNDS. IN IT WOULD MANDATE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES UNDERGROUND THEIR UTILITIES IN THE SAME TRAINS AS THE ELECTRICAL UNDERGROUNDING. THIS BIG ONES POLICY HELP AS A CASHIER AND MAKE OUR STATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. MORE RESILIENT ESPECIALLY IN THOSE HIGH. HIGHEST FIRE RISK ZONES. AND IT ALSO GUARANTEES A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY JUDICIAL REVIEW IN CALIFORNIA COURTS. IF AN UNDERGROUNDING PROJECT FACES A SEQUEL LAWSUIT.THE LEGISLATION WILL ALSO FURTHER REDUCE THE DEVASTATING CLIMATE IMPACTS WILDFIRES HAVE HAD IN OUR STATE. THE BILL SUPPORTED BY CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTERS BECAUSE- THE THIS UNION REPRESENTING THOUSANDS OF THE HARDEST WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA. DEFENDER COMMUNITIES IN RESIDENTS FROM THESE UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES WHICH ARE GROWING WORSE. AND WORSE EACH YEAR. I WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT. THIS IS A BIG BILL I GET IT. AND WE'RE HAVING MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WE ARE TO GET THIS DEAL DONE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH P. JEANNIE AND THE WOMEN AND MEN WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY THE LEXICAL WORKERS ON THE LANGUAGE BILL. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE OUR ACTIVE DISCUSSION IN THE WEEKS TO COME WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON THIS BILL WE'RE WORKING WITH THE OTHER UTILITIES IN I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR NOT EVERY A LEXICAL UTILITY IS CREATED EQUAL. S. G. G. S. D. GENIE IN THE SAN DIEGO REGION HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THE WEST IN UNDERGROUND IN THEIR LINES SO I DON'T WANT. BLANKET OVER ALL UTILITIES BUT JUST BEING CANDID PG&amp;E MUST DO BETTER. WE'VE ALSO BEEN MEETING WITH TELECOM I TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN FROM THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. HERE IN GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE TODAY. THE NUMBER% ONE THERE ARE WIRELESS AND THEN MEANS TODAY. TO THE LIMITS ARE GONNA CLARIFIED THAT EXISTING MICRO CELL SITES THAT ARE UP ON. UTILITY POLES THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE. PUT UNDERGROUND OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD NEVER WORK. NUMBER TWO- WE ARE MAY BE MUCH MORE STRATEGIC IN REGARDS TO WHICH- HOLES IN LINES WOULD HAVE TO GO UNDERGROUND. IT IS GOING TO BE BASED OFF OF HOW. HIGHER RISK AREAS ARE. IDENTIFIED IN THE MANAGEMENT PLANS. I'M IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER AMENDMENTS ELECTRIC- INDEPENDENT. L. I EAT ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO CONTINUOUSLY DEMONSTRATE A REASONABLE EFFORT TO EXHAUST ANY FEDERAL STATE AND OTHER FUNDING BEFORE SEEKING RECOVERY FROM RATEPAYERS. AND IT ALSO IS GONNA REQUIRED CPC TO CONSIDER THE RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES WHEN APPROVING APPLICATIONS FOR UNDERGROUNDING TRICK INFRASTRUCTURE. THE LAST THING I'M GONNA SAY. IS THIS. IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE HI WE HEARD FROM. SOME TELECONFERENCE IN IT IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO RAISE THE COST OF BROADBAND IN THE STATE. AND I GOTTA TELL YA I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT BROADBAND BECAUSE WHERE I LIVE. IT'S THE MOST UNSERVED UNDERSERVED REGION IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE MOST UNDERSERVED REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THERE WAS AN IMPLICATION THROUGH THE WORD SET- IT'S GONNA MAKE THE DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE STATE. THERE COULDN'T BE A MORE DISINGENUOUS ARGUMENT AND I DON'T NEED TO GET FIRED UP ABOUT THIS BUT IT WAS REALLY UPSETTING TO ME BECAUSE I WANT TO BE CANDID. THIS STATE IS HAVING TO SPEND SIX BILLION DOLLARS. SIX BILLION DOLLARS. TO DEPLOY BROADBAND TO UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED URBAN COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE INCUMBENTS. INCUMBENT TELECOM WON'T SERVE THEM. AND THEY HAVEN'T SERVE THEM FOR YEARS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SERVE THEM NOW THEY'RE NOT GONNA SERVE LATER. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE LINES THE TEN THOUSAND MILES A LINES. ARE GOING TO BE BURIED IN SOME OF THE MOST RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. WHERE THESE INCUMBENTS WILL NEVER INVEST. OF THE DOESN'T MAKE BUSINESS SENSE BUT THE STATE WELL WITH OUR SIX BILLION DOLLARS. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY. THAT ARGUMENT IS A BIT HOGWASH- AND I WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE IT WAS SO DISINGENUOUS WHEN I HEARD THAT IN THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. AND AGAIN I DON'T NEED TO BE FIRED UP ABOUT IT BUT IT WAS QUITE FRUSTRATING THE LAST THING YOU SAY IS THIS. WE'VE TAKEN UP A LOT OF BIG BILLS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ON UTILITIES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. EVERY BILL WE HAVE WORKED ON TOGETHER WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STRIKE A DEAL. THAT HAVE MADE OUR STATE MORE SAFE AND ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM INDUSTRY. WE HAD SB SIX SEVENTY. THAT RELATED TO POWER OUTAGE REPORTING FROM TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HAD SB THREE FORTY ONE. RELATED OUTAGES IN BACKUP POWER FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BOTH OF WHICH STARTED WITH SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY OPPOSITION AND WE HAD TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THE- AS A SESSION MOVED ON. WE AND I KNOW THAT EIGHT EIGHT FOUR IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. BUT YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE BILL WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND YES WE MAY HAVE DISAGREEMENTS IN COMMITTEE TODAY. BUT MY HOPE. MY HOPE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS RESOLVED. I WANT TO BE HONEST. THE WEST UNITED STATES IS ONLY GETTING HOTTER AND DRIER ONLY GETTING WORSE EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE ONLY PATH FORWARD. IS FOR ELECTRIC UTILITIES SPEED UP THE PACE OF MOVING POWER LINES UNDERGROUND LIVES ARE LITERALLY AT RISK NOW BE HONORED TO BE A TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE THE PACE OF MOVING POWER LINES ARE BROWN. AND WITH ME TODAY I'VE TERRY MCHALE REPRESENTING THE WOMEN A MAN OF CALIFORNICA TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO SECURE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IS REGARDED LEADER- WHEN I'M GOING TO MISTER MACALLAN SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN. BANDURAS SO THIS BILL IS SO LONG OVERDUE THOMAS EDISON WHO KNEW A FEW THINGS ABOUT ELECTRICITY- WHEN HE FIRST FIGURED OUT WHAT HE WAS HARVESTING ALSO DECIDED HE NEEDED TO. UNDERSTAND THAT A- SURE THAT WAS INHERENT AND IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS AGO. IN MENLO PARK NEW JERSEY THOMAS EDISON HAD UNDERGROUND CONVEYANCE OF ELECTRICAL POWER. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING INSTEAD IS AFTER EVERY MAJOR EMERGENCY WE HAVE A STUDY. IN THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS HAVE BEEN TEN OR TWELVE MAJOR STUDIES DEALING WITH THE EFFICACY IN THE NEED FOR THIS UNDERGROUND CONVEYANCE. THE PROBLEM IS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS ME HERE. IS THAT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WELL WE'VE BEEN FIDDLING AND NERO COULD HAVE BEEN HANDLING THIS PUBLIC POLICY BETTER THAN WHAT'S BEEN DONE NOW. WELL WE'VE BEEN BERNIE. THE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DEAL WITH THE WITH THE MOST DANGEROUS AND HISTORIC FIRES IN OUR HISTORY. IN THE LAST FIVE IN SIX YEARS WE HAVE NOT SEEN JUST FIRES WE'VE SEEN MEGA FIRES. WE SEE AN ENTIRE COMMUNITIES DESTROYED WE'VE SEEN BUSINESSES LOST WE'VE SEN LIVES LOST. AND MR MISTER WINNER. WE KNOW HOW THESE FIRES ARE STARTED WE KNOW WHO'S CAUSING THEM AND WE KNOW THAT ULTIMATELY WE'RE GOING TO GO UNDERGROUND AND I THINK THAT'S THE ESSENCE IN THE BASIS OF WHAT THE MAJORITY LEADER IS DOING TODAY. I WOULD SAY WHERE THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT THIS IS A UTILITY PROBLEM THIS IS NOT A. TELECOM PROBLEM. THE TELECOM PEOPLE HAVE NOT CREATED THE DANGER TO THE FIREFIGHTERS. AND I'M HOPING AND I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THE SENATOR TALKED THAT THERE WILL BE MORE DISCUSSION IN THAT REGARD. BUT IT IS LONG OVERDUE THE CENTER HAS ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE HISTORIC FIRES THE LAST FIVE YEARS. ARE GOING TO BE WORSE THIS YEAR. YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE. THE WINTER RAIN WE HAVEN'T HAD THE SNOW. WE'RE SEEN THE PROBLEMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND OF COURSE END OF END OF DROUGHT AND OF DISEASED TREES AND ALL OF THESE ARE GOING TO BURN MORE VOCIFEROUSLY IF WE DON'T START DEALING WITH THIS FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM. OF MODERNIZING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS AGO THOMAS EDISON WAS SAYING WAS NECESSARY IT IS TIME IT IS NEEDED WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MCCALLUM WELL NOW IS THERE ANY OTHER. BURKE TESTIMONY HERE IN% THE HEARING ROOM OF SO PLEASE COME FORWARD.

JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION SO IF I CAN HAVE A COUPLE SECONDS TO EXPLAIN- SO WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION BECAUSE WE% DO HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE TIME FRAMES INVOLVED IN THE BILL WE'VE BEEN VERY UPFRONT AND HONEST ABOUT THAT. BUT WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN GETTING THIS PROJECT DONE FASTER IN OUR COMMUNITIES A LOT OF OUR COUNTIES WANT THESE PRODUCTS A LOT OF OUR COUNTIES NEED THESE PROJECTS WE NEED. FOR THE RIGHT PROJECTS THAT ARE OUT. BECAUSE THEY'RE CRUCIAL TO IMPROVE ENERGY RELIABILITY AND TO REDUCE WILDFIRES. SO WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN BETTER COORDINATING SOME OF THESE UNDERGROUNDING EFFORTS WITH SOME OF THE OTHER PROVIDERS TO SO WE HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH YOU AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES THE TELCO ISSUES AND OTHER ISSUES. AND APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND ARE GOING FOR WILL JUST ASK PEOPLE TO STOP THEIR NAME AFFILIATION IF ANY AND THE FACT OF THEIR- SUPPORT.

OKAY THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING MEMBERS- AND CHAIR- STOCK HERE BUT THE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE- USTELECOM AN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR WHILE WE FULLY TRULY APPRECIATE. WHERE THERE WERE THE SENATORS COMING FROM IN TRYING TO MITIGATE THESE HIGH FIRE AREAS AND CREATE RESILIENCY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THIS DISTRICT WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE LIGHT OF THAT. HOWEVER THERE IS A VERY BIG COST TO TELECOM- I REPRESENT US TELECOM WE ARE FACILITY BASED WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES IN BROADBAND PROVIDERS IN THE STATE- THERE. THE COST TO UNDERGROUND IS SOMETIMES TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT TO BE AERIAL. AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE DISCRETION UNLIKE THE ELECTRICS TO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF OPTING IN AND DECIDING WHERE TO GO UNDERGROUND WE DO NOT GET THAT FRESH. THIS BILL MAN IT'S THAT WE GO UNDERGROUND WHETHER OR NOT IT WORKS FOR OUR RELIABILITY OF SERVICE WHETHER IT'S ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE AND MANY AREAS THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE FEASIBLE AS WELL AS I SAID THERE IS A COST. OF ONE OF OUR COMPANIES DID WHICH IS JUST ONE IS CERTAINLY JUST A JUST A COST ONE OF OUR COMPANIES HOME HAS PUT OUT A NUMBER OF. IT COSTS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THEIR COMPANY AND COST MORE FOR MANY MORE FIFTY THOUSAND TO GO AERIAL AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO GO UNDERGROUND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CUMULATIVE TOTAL THIS IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOVER MANY OF THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES THROUGH THEIR RATE. POTENTIALLY WOULD BRING EVEN HAVE FEDERAL FUNDS AS THE AMENDMENTS WOULD BE PUTTING UP FOR OUR PUT FORTH IN OUR IN THE BILL. WE DO NOT HAVE THAT KIND WE ARE RELUCTANT TO RAISE RATES WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WE DON'T WANT TO RAISE RATES ON OUR CUSTOMERS. I'M NOT SURE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS WILL BE OKAY DECISIONAL SURCHARGE FOR PAIN FOR PG&amp;E IS UNDERGROUNDING THIS IS THIS IS PROBLEMATIC THERE IS A COST. AND WE DO WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH WITH THE- THE SENATOR BUT THE COSTS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY WE CAN'T RECOVER THEM. WE KNOW THAT THIS LEGISLATURE THIS BODY INCLUDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE PUT MORE FOR TO TRY TO REACH THOSE LAST UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED AREAS OF CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE MAINLY RULE. THIS CREATES A NEW DINING. NOT HAVE PROTEST IN THE PAST NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE HOW THEY CAN RECOVER THEIR COSTS. BY GOING TO THAT LAST MILE- SO DID THE INVESTMENTS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THAT YOU HAVE MADE FROM THIS LEGISLATURE. REALLY DO CREATED DIFFERENT DYNAMIC WE DN'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE GRANTS WOULD BE IN THESE HIGH FIRE AREAS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU IF IT COSTS TEN TIMES MORE TO GO UNDERGROUND IT'S GOING TO COST TEN TIMES MORE. IN USING THE MONEY THAT THIS BODY HAS PUT FORWARD WE ASK FOR THE DISCRETION TO GO UNDERGROUND WHEN IT WORKS. TO WORK WITH THE UTILITIES AS WE DO NOW WHERE WE CAN COLLABORATIVELY AND IN PARTNERSHIP WORK TOGETHER. AND SHARING COST WHERE IT'S FEASIBLE- BUT WE CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL AT THIS TIME AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WHEN I GOT A NEXT WITNESS WHO WILL HAVE- FORTY FIVE SECONDS BECAUSE I WENT OVER. THAT ONE WELL OVER THE TWO MINUTES- SO YOU CAN USE.

IN THE COURTS SO IT'S UNCLEAR HOW. DID LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WHICH REQUIRES UNIFICATION BY THE GOVERNOR BY TWENTY FORTY WHAT ACTUALLY X. BUT I PROCESS ON ALL THE THINGS TO SAY THAT.

THAT ARE BURNING DOWN- I JUST MASSIVE THREATS- BECAUSE- THIS COMPANY HAS FAILED TO MAINTAIN UPGRADE AND MODERNIZE ITS SPRAWLING INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT HAS HAD A MASSIVE MONOPOLY. THROUGH I'M- IT THROUGH THE MAIL THE BULK OF CALIFORNIA- AND YET IT HAS FOCUSED ON ITS SHAREHOLDERS. AS OPPOSED TO INVESTING TO HAVE THE MOST THE SAFEST AND MOST RELIABLE ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- AND THAT HAS TO CHANGE AND WE'RE NOW STUCK HOLDING THE BAG. WE'RE NOT HOLDING THE BAG AND AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER RESOURCES THAT IS HAD TO GO TO CLEAN UP THE MESS THAT PG&amp;E HAS CREATED IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY AND BREATHTAKING AND I WISH THAT WE COULD HAVE USED THOSE FUNDS TO. FIX OUR SCHOOLS AND TO IMPROVE OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH INSTEAD WE'VE HAD TO JUST CLEAN UP PG&amp;E IS MASS. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN- AND IT'S LIKE- IT'S LIKE YOU SEE THE MOVIE OVER AND FORGET AND WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS THING AND THEN WE DON'T I YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK YOU DO NEED TO BE A SHAREHOLDER. OWNED COMPANY AND I HAVE. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION A FEW YEARS AGO TO MAKE IT A PUBLICLY OWNED COMPANY- THAT LEGISLATION DID NOT EVEN GET A HEARING- INVEST- BUILDING. AND WE NEED TO HAVE STRUCTURAL CHANGES OF PG&amp;E. SO THAT IS ACTUALLY. FOCUSED LIKE A LASER. ON HAVING RELIABLE SAFE SERVICE IT DOESN'T BURN DOWN ENTIRE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T I'M VERY SKEPTICAL THAT PG&amp;E IS CAPABLE OF DOING THAT AS LONG AS IT IS BEHOLDEN TO WALL STREET WHICH IS WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. BUT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE- AND SO THIS LEGISLATION IS AN IMPORTANT STOP IN IN TRYING TO DO WHAT SHOULD'VE BEEN HAPPENING ALL ALONG TO MAKE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SAFE AND SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT AND I COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR DOING VERY HARD-WORK THERE'S A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED HERE- AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY THAT YOU. HAVE PUT INTO IT CONTINUE TO PUT INTO IT AGAIN IF YOU'RE- AND- WITH THAT- ALL ENTERTAINED I'M A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU HAVE ONE DOWN THERE HELLO I APOLOGIZE.

NEXT BILL IS NUMBER SIX DODD. WHAT IT. TURNS OUT OF NEWMAN I DIDN'T SEE OF THEIR GENDER THE NEWMAN PLEASE COME FORWARD. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SIR. YEAH THANK YOU COMMITTEE MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE PRE SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHEN PASSED SB THIRTY SEVENTY SEVEN WILL ACCEPT THE TOURNEY'S FREEZE AWARDED AND CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGAL SETTLEMENT FROM BEING COUNTED AGAINST THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME. I'D LIKE TO COME OVER TO PROBABLY THINK COMMITTEE STAFF THE SPONSORS IN THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE WITH THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE INTENT OF THE BILL WAS CAPTURED ACCURATELY. CALIFORNIA LIKE OTHER STATES THAT RIGOROUSLY ENFORCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ALLOWS LAWYERS TO REPRESENT CLIENTS IN CONSUMER PROTECTION CASES. WITHOUT CHARGING THEM DIRECTLY FOR THE LEGAL SERVICES IN A PROCESS CALLED FEE SHIFTING. THIS ALLOWS EVERYDAY PEOPLE TO PURSUE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWSUITS BY REMOVING THE COST BARRIERS ASSOCIATED HAVING A QUALIFIED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE ATTORNEY REPRESENT THEM. DEBT COLLECTION FINANCIAL LENDING CREDIT REPORTING VEHICLE SAFETY AND OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTION CASES ARE OFTEN TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY RESULTING IN JUDGMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL FEES. IN RECENT YEARS COMPANIES ON THE LOSING SIDE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWSUITS HAVE MADE A PRACTICE OF ISSUING IRIS TEN NINETY NINE FORMS THE TRIGGERING ALL OR SOME. OF THE ATTORNEYS FEES AS PERSONAL INCOME RECEIVED BY INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATING TUMOR PROTECTION LAWSUIT. THE PRO RATED AMOUNT OF LEGAL FEES A TRIBUTE TO A PLAINTIFF CAN BE VERY LARGE EVEN THOUGH THE PLAINTIVE ACTUALLY RECEIVED NO CASH BENEFIT FROM THEM AND CAN REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL TAX LIABILITY AS A RESULT. IN MANY CASES EXCEEDING THE ACTUAL WORD AN INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFF MAY HAVE RECEIVED. TOURNEY STREAK BUT TRIBUNE AS INCOME THEY ALSO THE PLAINTIFFS ELIGIBILITY FOR IMPORTANT PROGRAMS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT HOUSING BENEFITS. EDUCATION BENEFITS OR MORE MORE. FURTHER IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THE ATTORNEYS WHO WOULD ACTUALLY RECEIVE THESE AWARDS ALSO RECEIVE A FORM TEN NINETY NINE FOR THE PAYMENT OF THEIR FEES. RESULTING IN THE SAME SETTLEMENT FUNDS INFECTION TAX NOT ONCE BUT TWICE FRUITING TOURNEY'S THESE AS A TAX LIABILITY ASSIGNABLE TO A PLAINTIFF IN A FEW SHIFTED CASE UNDERMINES THE INTENT. OF CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS MORE OVER THE PROSPECT OF THAT HAPPENING HAS BEEN LEVERAGED BY CORPORATE DEFENDANTS. TO INTIMIDATE AND DISSUADE CONSUMERS FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH AN OTHERWISE RIGHTEOUS CASE SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WILL EXTENDED TWO THOUSAND FOUR FEDERAL TAX AMENDMENT. TO PROVIDE AN ABOVE THE LINE DEDUCTION FOR FEE AWARDS RECOVERING CONSUMER PROTECTION CASES SEVEN ATTORNEYS FEES WILL NOT COUNT AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL'S ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME. ON THEIR STATE TAXES THIS COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION WILL RELEASED RELIEF CONSUMERS OF UNDUE UNJUSTIFIED FINANCIAL BURDENS WHILE REINFORCING PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS WHO'VE BEEN HARMED AS A RESULT OF A PRODUCT DEFECT OR ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES- I RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TO TESTIFIED BY PHONE TODAY ARE ROBERT CARROLL. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA. WAS MARY SHANAHAN PRESIDENT OF CONSUMERS FOR AUTO. RELIABILITY SAFETY OR CARS. IN PROCEED WITH YOUR WITNESS REFERRAL FIRST- WHICH ONE DO WITH- MISTER AND BOTH ARE ON THE PHONE. PLEASE PRESS ONE IN THE MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND LYFT GERMAN THE MEMBERS. MARLBORO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA WHERE TRUCKERS FINANCER OF ENERGY IN THISBILL SB THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN- THEY'RE VERY BRIEFLY TO THE NAVAL ON THE GENDER AND LOTS OF FOLKS HAVE TO BE SIMULTANEOUS PLACES- THIS IS A SIMPLE MATTER OF DOUBLE TAXATION- THE ATTORNEYS WHO TOOK ON THESE CASES ARE ALREADY BEING TAXED FOR THE RINKER MENTIONED HER NEWMAN SAID. AND THERE'S NO REASON WHATSOEVER WHY THE CONSUMER ON THE TAXES WELL ACTIVE CASES THAT WE'VE SEEN- INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE. PEOPLE WHO GET A LEMON AND THEY JUST WANT THE MANUFACTURER HAS THE DEALER TO TAKE THAT BACK IF THIS IS A SMALL PURCHASE YOU GO BACK TO THE STORE AND GET YOUR REFUND THAT'S IT. BUT IN THIS SITUATION BEFORE BEING SERVED WITH THAT TEN NINETY NINES FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND THEY CAN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO REMOTE WE CALCULATE HOW THAT CAME FROM BUT WHAT HAPPENED- SO TO DOUBLE TAXATION MATTER AND WE DON'T SEE IT UNIFORMLY APPLIED. WE SEE CERTAIN COMPANIES BEING EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE- WHICH IS A SORT OF INTIMIDATION TACTIC AGAINST CONSUMERS ATTEMPTING TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS SO FOR THOSE REASONS- AND WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND- COMMITTEE STAFF AND HAS TO BE FOR ALL WORKING WITH A SNORKEL SPONSORS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. SB THIRTY SEVEN SEVEN THANK YOU. AND NEXT WITNESS. MR FIVE CARE NUMBER BY TO MARRY HIM CAN FOR AUTO REALIZED AND OR CALL AND WE'RE TO BE COACHED SB THIRTY SEVENTY SEVEN ALONG WITH THAT CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD ADD TO- THE TESTIMONY YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE BUILT IT NOT ONLY DO VICTIMS OF ILLEGAL PRACTICES BASED HAVING TO PAY TAXES ON INCOME THEY NEVER RECIEVED WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY UNFAIR BUT THEY MAY ALSO BE COMING IN ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE AND BENEFITS THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES DESPERATELY NEEDED. AND THAT THE STATE- INTENDS TO PROVIDE TO THEM SOMETIMES TO KEEP THEM FROM BECOMING HOMELESS OR MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT- WHEN THERE'S A POSTED INCOMES ARE INFLATED BY THIS UNFAIR DOUBLE PACK AND JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE OF CONSUMER WHO LIVE THING GUARDINO WHO HAD A- WITHIN MILITARY VETERANS SINGLE MOM WITH FOUR KIDS ONE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS- WAS COUNTING ON GETTING HER EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AFTER HE GOT LAID OFF. AND THEN MAKE IN. SIX OUT DOLLARS THE HE WAS A- TO GET WITH THE MAY BECAUSE- SHE HAD PURCHASED A LEMON FROM FIAT CHRYSLER AND THEY CENTER A TEN NINETY NINE- NOT FOR THE AMOUNT THAT SHE RECEIVED AND REFUND BUT FOR. AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN A SHE NEVER BOX- AND HE ENDED UP HAVING TO SPEND SIX MONTHS WRANGLING WITH THE IRS AND ENLISTING THE AID OF A TAX ACCOUNTANT IN ORDER TO FINALLY GET THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT VERY MOTIVATED TO. IMPORTANT THE BILL AND IF I COULD JUST NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE CITING A CASE. WHERE CONSUMER- BROUGHT OUT OF LEMON CASE AGAINST JAGUAR ALLEGING THAT HIS VEHICLE WAS A LEMON AND THAT THAT CASE IS REALLY AN OUT LIAR FAR FROM TYPICAL THE CONSUMER IN THAT CASE WAS AWARDED ONLY NOMINAL DAMAGES BUT HIS ATTORNEY WAS AWARDED OVER. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ATTORNEY'S FEES AND USUALLY WOMEN OWNERS RECEIVE A REFINED AND THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES ARE QUITE MODEST- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN JANUARY THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THAT DECISION KICKING IT BACK TO THE LOWER COURT. AND THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS ALSO FOUND THAT IT WAS THE DEFENDANT. JAGUAR THAT'D FILED MOTION AFTER MOTION TO SUPPRESS INFORMATION AND QUOTING FROM THE COURT'S DECISION PERHAPS SUCH FEES WERE JUSTIFIED AFTER ALL TRIAL WAS DELAYED OVER TWO YEARS IN THIS MATTER AND IT APPEARS THAT JAGUAR'S ACTIONS FOR THE IMPOTENCE FOR MOST OF NOT ALL OF. THE DELAY SO. JEFF TO GET A OUT THERE THE CASE THAT THE OPPONENTS BY THE- FIRE THE NORM AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. FOUR SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THANK YOU. CAN THANK YOU.

THERE'S REALLY TWO ISSUES HERE THE FIRST IS DOUBLE TAXATION- YOU KNOW FIVE. WHICH EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE IT. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN THIS CASE IT IS THE ATTORNEY TO RECEIVE THE CASH BENEFIT- OF THE PAYMENTS AS IT IS THEY WHO SHOULD PAY THE TAXES FOR IT- THE OTHER CONCERN IS. THE DISINCENTIVE ASIAN OF THE INTIMIDATION. ORCHESTRATION OF. PROSPECTIVE PLAINTIFFS- FOR PURSUING OTHERWISE LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES IN IN RESPONSE TO THE THREAT. OF A TAX BURDEN THEY MIGHT IT CRUZ SIMPLY BY- YOU KNOW AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THEIR- LEGAL RIGHTS IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. THIS BILL DOES THAT BY ELIMINATING THE DOUBLE TAXATION WITH WITH WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AGO.AGAIN I. DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR RUSSELL OCEAN IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR CAPITO. NIELSEN NO NIELSEN NOW DORADO DORADO HI HERTZBERG WIENER AYE WIENER HI. TWO TO ONE THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU. YEAH GENERAL CASKEY. YES MISTER MEISTER THIS IS ITEM NUMBER SIX. OKAY. TEN NINETY NINE CORRECT CORRECT CORRECT AND FIRST OFF MEMBERS I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS CONTAINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR IMPROVING THE BILL THIS MEASURED TEN SB TEN NINETY NINE MAKES A MODEST UP IMPORTANT- UPDATES OR BANKRUPTCY LAW SPECIFIC TO THE COMMITTEES- PURVIEW THE BILL CAPS THE INTEREST RATE PAYABLE ON DELINQUENT REAL ESTATE. TAXES IN A BANKRUPTCY CASE AT 10% RATHER THAN THE CURRENT 18% THIS EIGHTY ONE WE REMEMBER THE INFLATIONARY CASE AT THAT TIME AND NOBODY HAS STARTED IN FORTY YEARS TO UPDATED- SO YOU KNOW THE STATE LAW PROVIDES THAT 10% IN INTEREST ON JUDGMENTS AND MAKES INTERESTS OVER 10% YOU STRESS SO IT'S NFUSZ AND COLLECTIBLE SO WE'RE TRYING TO CONFORM THAT WITH THE- THE- THE TAX CLAIMS. TO CONFORM THAT AT LEAST WITHIN- THE BANKRUPTCY ROUTE A BY THE WAY THAT THESE CLAIMS ON THE PROPERTY TAXES HAVE FIRST PRIORITY SO THEY GET PAID FIRST OFF- WITHIN THAT HAD A DEBTOR'S CHAPTER THIRTEEN AND SUCCESS RATE AND CHAPTER THIRTEEN IS REALLY PREDICATED ON HOW THE DEBTORS ABILITY TO PAY SO IF YOU'RE PAYING 18% ON THE INTEREST THEN YOU. PRESS THE ANOTHER 10% IT BE JUST BECOMES YOU KNOW DIFFICULT TO FACILITATE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS WITH ME ON THE PHONE LINE IS A JENNY A DOUBLING HE'S AN ATTORNEY SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE- AND PART OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEYS AND ORIGINAL VOTE. AND THIS IS MRS DOLING DOLING YES OKAY MISSPELLING. THE WISH TO TESTIFY MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I REPRESENTS DEBTORS CREDITORS IN BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEES AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS YOU COMPONENTS OF S. B. TEN NINETY NINE I FIRST ATTENDED A WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT THEN THE PROPERTY TAX QUESTION SB TEN NINETY NINE DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE COUNTY IS RIGHT AND THAT. THE BILL PROPOSES A REASONABLE CATHOLIC DOES NOT INDICATE THE DEBTORS ABILITY TO BRING THE PROPERTY TAX THAT THE CURRENT OVER A THREE TO FIVE YEAR BANKRUPTCY PLAN OF REORGANIZATION IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NEITHER THE IRS NOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD GET MORE THAN 4% INTEREST IN A BANKRUPTCY PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. THE MAINTAINING THE FAMILY HOME SHOULD BE A CORE CONCERN FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY IN THE FINANCE NATIONAL HOUSING CRISIS WE ARE FACING FACING THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE SPECIAL OR DIFFICULT CALCULATIONS WHATEVER THE DEBT IS OWED ON THE DATE THE BANKRUPTCY IT FILED WILL BE PAID THAT 10% INTEREST INSTEAD OF 18% DIFFERENT THAN WHAT ENCOURAGE DELINQUENT HOMEOWNERS TO REORGANIZE THEIR DEBT IN A CHAPTER THIRTEEN BANKRUPTCY WHICH PUTS MONEY BACK INTO OUR COUNTY COFFERS AND CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HOMEOWNER. STATING THEIR HOME OR NOT THE ISSUE I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON IS THE HOMESTEAD APPRECIATION SECTION OF S. B. TEN NINETY NINE. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR A VERY SIMPLE REASON. WHEN A DEBTOR FOR. AND ARE IS A FROM THE DATE THEY FILED A CASE THAT SHOULD BE A IF YOU CLOSE. INSTEAD TRUSTEE CAN HUMAN AT THE FOR. I HOLDING. OPEN TO ALLOW PROPER VALUES INCREASE FOR THE TRUSTEES CAN SELL THOSE HOMES. THIS IS AN UNFAIR MANIPULATION OF THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION CODES THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT. A MEDIAN PRICED HOME. THE FILING THE BANKRUPTCY IS AND SHOULD BE A LINE DRAWN IN THE SAND. THE VALUE OF THE AFFECT ON THAT DATE THE BANKRUPTCY IS FILED SHOULD BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER WAYS THAT WE VALUE OUT THAT BUT TO THE DEBTORS WAGES AND THE BETTER THINK ACCOUNT ON THE DATE THE BANKRUPTCY IS FILED. HAVE BEEN BETTER CONTINUES TO WORK AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY IS FILED HIS HAIR IS DEPOSITED INTO HIS BANK ACCOUNT INCREASING NOT BANK ACCOUNT VALUE. BOTH BANK ACCOUNT INCREASING IN VALUE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE SEEN BY LAW. AND ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEATED. THE ONLY RELATIVELY THE BANKRUPTCY CASE OPEN IN PERPETUITY UNDERMINING THE FRESH START INTENDED BY CONGRESS. ATTENTION INCREASE IN VALUE IN A HOME IS NO DIFFERENT AND IT SHOULD AMERICANS GET BETTER BENEFIT NOT THE- BANKRUPTCY ESTATE AGAIN WE JUST DON'T WANT AN UNFAIR MANIPULATION OF EXEMPTIONS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THE WITH THE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS. KNOWN RESTORING THAT'S IT OKAY. ALL RIGHT AND DO WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITE. ON THAT OKAY MORE SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. YOUR POST YEAH ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. ON THE PHONE. YEAH DO WE HAVE TO. MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANY CALL IN TESTIFY IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. ONE FILED BY ZERO. MISTER CARE NOBODY IS QUEUING UP ALL RIGHT WE HAVE AN OPPOSITION WITH FORTY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE DALLAS CELANESE ON BEHALF OF THE TRUSTEES FOR REASONABLE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION LIMITS WHICH IS A GROUP OF BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEES THE CALIFORNIA JUDGMENT PRESERVATION ALLIANCE WHICH IS COMPRISED OF JUDGMENT ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS BOTH STRONGLY OPPOSED SB TEN NINETY NINE. ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THANKS EXPONENTIAL INCREASE OF THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION WENT INTO AFFECT THE DEPEND UPON YOUR AGE AND MARITAL STATUS THE INCREASE RANGE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND 50% CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ONLY INCREASED BY 21% DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. SB TEN NINETY NINE SETS IN MOTION ADDITIONAL HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION LIMITS. BEYOND WHAT WAS INCREASE JUST LAST YEAR. ONCE AGAIN WEALTHY DONORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SHELTER MONEY FROM MORE THE CREDITORS. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE THEY ATTRACT A BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE SELL THE DEBTORS ARE ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR RESIDENTS. AND THE RESIDENCE HAS AN UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AFTER SATISFYING SALES COSTS PAYING OFF THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR MORTGAGE BALANCE THE PAIN THE DEBTOR THERE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION THE NET PROCEEDS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. PURSUANT TO BANKRUPTCY CODE THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE WOULD THEN DISTRIBUTE THE NET PROCEEDS BY PAYING THE DEBTORS WERE THE CREDITORS. HOWEVER OF F. S. B. TEN NINETY NINE WORDS WAS ENACTED. THE DEBTOR WOULD ARGUE THAT THE RESIDENTS APPRECIATED DURING THE CASE. THAT THEY SHOULD EXEMPTS SOME OR ALL THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE. SUCH ISSUE WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE TO BE LITIGATED. BUT IT HAS THE ADDITIONAL FACT FURTHER INCREASING THE DEBTORS HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. ON THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WAS JUST RECENTLY ADOPTED. OPPONENTS CLAIM THAT TRUSTEES ARE PURPOSELY SITTING ON DEBTORS REAL PROPERTY SO CAN APPRECIATE. THIS IS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. DEBTORS CAN IMMEDIATELY MOVE FOR VANAMAN UNDER SECTION FIVE FIVE FOUR B. OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. IT IS A SIMPLE MOTION THAT OBVIATES THE NEED FOR FURTHER INCREASES IN THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. ARE THERE FOR THE TRUSTEES FOR REASONABLE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION LIMITS. AND THE CALIFORNIA JUDGMENT PRESERVATION ALLIANCE RESPECTFULLY URGES THAT YOU VOTE NO ON SB TEN NINETY NINE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HERE PRESENT. MODERATOR DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. IN OPPOSITION HERE IF YOU WOULD LIKE.

SO WE'VE STARKLY OPPOSED AND FIFTY PER NINETY NINE AND ASK FOR YOUR NOTEBOOK THANK YOU THANK YOU. NOBODY ELSE IS CUTE MISTER CHAIR NOBODY ELSE. ALL RIGHT AT THIS TIME SIR. IF YOU WANNA GO AHEAD THEN YEAH I WOULD I'D- WHICH IS BEING ADDED BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE DISPUTED WAGES AND THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BANKRUPTCY THE TRUSTEE HAS ALL THE POWERS TO SETTLE THOSE WAGE CLAIMS THAT YOU HAD SO WE WANTED TO ALLOW THAT THE DEBTOR IF THEY'RE HAVING A DISPUTE AND IT JUST HAPPENS THAT THE TIMING WAS OFF- THAT THEY WOULD. THEY WOULD RETAIN THOSE RIGHTS AND WE PUT A CAP ON IT AS SAID AS SAID IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE AT JUDICIARY DEAD- BURKE I WOULD JUST URGE IN AN AYE VOTE THIS IS A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

THROUGH THESE RIVERS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONTAMINANTS IS ACTUALLY USED TIRES CALIFORNIA HAS A PROGRAM TO RECYCLE USED TIRES. OFTENTIMES WHEN WE SELL THOSE USED TIRES ARE OFTENTIMES PEOPLE SELL UP BY THOSE TIRES AND EXPORTING TO MEXICO FOR RE USE WHEN THERE THE ACTOR ABSOLUTE END OF LIFE SO THEY HAVE.

ACCORDING TO A RECENT HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION ASSESSMENT THE CENTER REGION IS FACING A HOUSING SHORTAGE OF ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND UNITS AND REQUIRES ENOUGH ANOTHER NINETY THOUSAND HOMES BUT TWENTY THIRTY JUST TO KEEP UP WITH POPULATION GROWTH. THE SHORTAGE HAS INCREASED RENTAL AND HOME PRICES DRIVING FOLKS UP FURTHER FURTHER AWAY FROM NOT ONLY URBAN CENTERS BUT WHERE THEY WORK AND WHERE THEY'RE EMPLOYED. AND WE NEED TO DO BETTER JOBS AND CALIFORNIA OF CITING PEOPLE CLOSER TO WHERE THEY WORK SO THAT WE CAN- YOU KNOW- RELY LESS ON ON ENERGY AND PROGRAM AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO GET PEOPLE TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE TO WORK- UP.

WHY DO WE NEED ANOTHER LOCAL HOUSING AGENCY CAN WE NOT DEAL WITH WHAT WE'VE ALREADY GOT IN PLACE. IN THE COUNTY. LUNCH IF THE HOUSING AS I'M SURE ALL OF YOUR WHERE IT IS NOT A LOCAL ISSUE THERE ARE LOTS OF DECISIONS BUT IT'S A REGIONAL ISSUE WE HAVE MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE- LOCALLY. AND IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND WE WOULD HAVE MUCH GREATER ABILITY TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OF WITH A REGIONAL AND TO TAKE. DOES NOT DO DID DOES THAT DOES NOT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT OUR THE ABILITY TO FORM A JPA. MISTER CHAIRMAN THE ECONOMIC TRICK QUESTIONS PLEASE AND I CAN DO THAT IN MY CLOSING IF YOU FIVE FIVE I CAN ANSWER THAT CENTER AWAY SO WE'LL DO THAT. THE CLOSER. MOST OF THE DRUGS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NO BUT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL BILL IS MOVED BY SENATOR GARAGE SO. YEP WE'LL GET TO THE OPPOSITION. DO WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION HERE PRESENT. IN THE HEARING ROOM. MODERATOR ANY OPPOSITION IN Q. HE WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION THAT SKEWS ME SB ELEVEN OH FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME WHEN FALL BY ZERO. MISTER CHAIR THIS TIME. HEARING NONE THEN SENATE HUESO THANK YOU MISTER AND THOUGHT OF YOU KNOW SEND YOU COUNTY IS- COUNTY WITH UP I THINK IT'S APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN CITIES IF MY RECOLLECTION SERVES ME WELL AND REMEMBER MY VERY SMALL SOME OF- ARE LOCATED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTY AND SO OFTEN TIMES YOU HAVE SOME CITIES THAT ARE DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT. AND SOME CITIES ARE VERY LARGE EMPLOYMENT CENTERS WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT AND THAT OFTEN CREATES AN IMBALANCE THAT THAT CREATES GRIDLOCK AND TRAFFIC AND SO WHEN WE BUILD HIGHWAYS AND SAID HE WILL COUNTY IT'S KIND OF A PROCESS BY WHICH WE WORK WITH THE CALTRANS SANDAG AND THE LOCAL CITIES EACH CITY GETS AN ALLOCATION OF FOR BASED ON THEIR NEEDS. AND SO I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND OUR PLANNING EFFORT IS YOU WANT TO. UP A- TARGET BUILDING HOUSING MOSTLY WHERE YOU NEED IT. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE TRYING TO DO THAT AND SO ONE CENTRAL AGENCY CAN OFTENTIMES TO A BETTER JOB AT. A DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS AND THEY CAN HELP WORK WITH CITIES TO HELP THEM MEET. THEIR THEIR NEEDS BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE DONE BASED ON ON ON DEMAND. AND I THINK THAT'S OF THAT MODEL ESPECIALLY FOR SENEGAL COUNTY IS VERY VERY pTHE SUPERVISOR SAID WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR MANY YEARS NOW. HOW DO HOW DO PLAN FOR HOW A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT STATE WITHOUT. WITHOUT NECESSARILY. CREATING SPRAWL SPRAWL- WILL- BASICALLY TOKO TAKEOVER ARE SMALL FARMS IN OUR AGRICULTURAL AREAS I THINK IN SAN DIEGO WE DON'T WANT THAT WE WANT TO WE WANT TO DO MORE INFILL WE WANT TO CITE. A HOUSING NEXT TO MASS TRANSIT AND WIND UP A COMPANY WIDE PLANNING AGENCY CAN REALLY HIGHLIGHT THE BEST PLACES TO DO THAT IN THE MOST EFFICIENT COST EFFICIENT WAYS TO DO THAT. AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND LIVE WHERE THEY CAN. UP THE HEALTHIEST- THAT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT YOU THROUGH IT DO IT TO ONE CENTRAL. AGENCY I WANT TO REMIND- THE COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC THAT THIS IS A SANDY WILL COUNTY SPECIFIC BILL. AND IT HAS THE SUPPORT OF MANY OF COUNTY LEADERS AND SENDEK LEADERS- WITH THE SUPPORT LIST IS GROWING. EVERY SINGLEDAY RECENTLY WEEK WE GOT THE SUPPORT OF SENATE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THE CITY'S SOLANA BEACH. THE CITY OF LA MESA THE CITY OF NATIONAL CITY. THE CITY OF IMPERIAL BEACH WE GOT A LETTER FROM- COUNCIL MET- PREZ A COUNCIL MEMBER A STEVE BY THE YEAR RECENTLY AND OTHER LETTERS ARE COMING IN FROM OTHER LEADERS. THEY THEY AGREE. THAT THIS IS. AND SEND IT WILL AND IT WOULD BE A FURTHER TOOL THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY COST. CITIES OR TAXPAYERS OR ANYONE ELSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. BUT IT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE. IN HELPING TO COORDINATE THE CREATION AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND BRING IN THE MONEY NECESSARY TO DO IT. ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY ANY. FURTHER CLOSING THEN I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A- MOTION IT'S PAST SEVEN MOROCCO. HELLO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND WE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATORS CAPITO. NIELSEN HI NIELSEN HI DORADO DORADO I HERTZBERG. WIENER. TWO ZERO. TWO ZERO PUT THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN CENTREBOARD JUST. THIRTEEN SEVENTY FOUR GOOD MORNING WHILE THIS IS AN EVENTFUL WEEK THANKS PRETTY AMAZING. ALL RIGHT. GOOD MORNING OUR MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF TO IMPROVE THE BILL IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS SENATE BILL THIRTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SIX TO PROVIDE A STATE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO TUITION SAVINGS PROGRAMS KNOWN AS SCHOLARS SHARE FIVE TWO NINE ACCOUNTS QUALIFY TAXPAYERS. FIVE TWO NINE OR FIVE TWO NINES ARE ACCOUNT VEHICLES THAT ALLOW INVESTMENTS TO GROW TAX FREE AND CAN ONLY BE USED FOR HIGHER EDUCATION PURPOSES ALTHOUGH CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY DEDUCTIBLE. EARNINGS IN A FIVE TO NINE PLAN GROW TAX FREE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND ARE NOT TAXED WHEN THE MONEY IS USED TO PAY FOR QUALIFIED COLLEGE EXPENSES. IN EFFORT TO INCENTIVIZE THIS INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION OVER THIRTY STATES THIRTY. OFFER FULL OR PARTIAL TAX DEDUCTION OR CREDIT CALIFORNIA REMAINS A STATE THAT DOES NOT. THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL WAS PREVIOUSLY INTRODUCED AB TWO ELEVEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER IAN CALDERON THE MEASURE RECEIVED WIDE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. HOWEVER THE MEASURE WAS VETOED DUE TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS REVENUE HOWEVER NOW IS THE TIME TO ENCOURAGE TAXPAYERS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION CONTINUES TO SKYROCKET AS THE ANALYSIS PROPERLY NOTES ALLOWING ELIGIBLE TAXPAYERS THIS TAX DEDUCTION WILL INCREASE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. IN A ISSUE I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE UPON. SO TODAY I HAVE WITH ME CASEY O'CONNOR ON BEHALF OF THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THIS VALUABLE PROGRAM WITH THE BLESSINGS OF THE VICE CHAIR. PLEASE THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING- MISTER TERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM CASEY O'CONNOR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR STATE TREASURER FIONA MA WHO ALSO SERVES AS THE CHAIR OF THE SCHOLARS YOUR INVESTMENT BOARD UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. WE WERE PROUD TO SUPPORT AB TWO ELEVEN WE'RE VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FOUR TODAY ONE OF THE GREATEST HURDLES FAMILIES FACE WHEN CONTEMPLATING WHETHER TO PURSUE A POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. IS THE SKYROCKETING COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE WHICH IS GROWING AT A RATE OF TWO TO THREE TIMES THE RATE OF INFLATION. IT'S VERY CONCERNING THAT STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND THE U. S. HAS NOW TOPPED ONE POINT SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS IT HAS SURPASSED AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF PERSONAL DATA SIDE OF MORTGAGES. WITH REGARD TO STUDENT LOAN DEBT A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT 40% MILLENNIAL HOUSEHOLDS AGE TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY EIGHT. HAVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN 40% OF THEIR INCOME. FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF BORROWERS CONTRIBUTING TO THAT ONE POINT SEVEN TRILLION WITH THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION BORROWERS IN OUR STATE. AND THE AVERAGE STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR CALIFORNIANS TO GRADUATE IN TWENTY TWENTY IS TWENTY ONE THOUSAND A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER STUDENT. YET DESPITE THESE ALARMING TRENDS ONLY 56% OF FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN ARE SAVING FOR COLLEGE OF THAT 56% ONLY 30% ARE USING QUALIFY FIVE TWO NINE. TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THE PASSAGE OF SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FOUR WOULD LEAD TO A GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA SCHOLARS SHARE FIVE TO NINE PLAN. AND WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED PLAN ASSETS ALLOWING FOR A WIDE RANGE IN IN STATE BENEFITS. SUCH AS REDUCTIONS TO ALREADY LOW FEES FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS OR EXPANSION OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO ASSIST UNDERSERVED. POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LIKE OUR FIVE TWO NINE MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM WHICH OFFERS ELIGIBLE FAMILIES EARNING SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS. A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH UP TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A BONUS OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. FOR ESTABLISHING AUTOMATIC CONTRIBUTION PLAN. NATIONALLY THIRTY FOUR STATES AND WASHINGTON DC HAVE FULL OR PARTIAL TAX DEDUCTIONS WELL CALIFORNIA USUALLY PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING A LEADER IN THE SPACES. WE ARE ONE OF ONLY STATES ONE OF ONLY SEVEN STATES WITH THE TECH WITH NO TAX INCENTIVE. DESPITE INCOME TAX WERE ON PAR WITH KENTUCKY NORTH CAROLINA DELAWARE MAINE MASSACHUSETTS AND HAWAII. WITHOUT ANY IN STATE TAX INCENTIVE MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE OPTING TO INVEST. AN ESTIMATED TWENTY FOUR BILLION IN OUT OF STATE FIVE TO NINE PLANS. PRIMARILY THOSE WITH HIGHER FEES. OFFERED THROUGH A FINANCIAL ADVISER RATHER THAN INVESTING IN THE LOW CLASS SCHOLARSHIP FIVE TO NINE PLAN. ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE UNDERSTAND WE DID A STUDY ON THIS BACK WHEN WE DID THE BILL AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY NINETY FIVE THOUSAND. NEW ACCOUNTS WOULD BE OPENED UNDER THIS MEASURE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND ACCOUNTS WILL BE ROLLED OVER FROM OUT OF STATE PLANS AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NEW ACCOUNTS WOULD OPEN. FOR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO I WILL WRAP IT UP SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FOUR IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MEASURE. WE KNOW THAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS HUGE HERE AND ANOTHER BENEFIT WOULD BE A TAX DEDUCTION WOULD REACH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FOR THOSE EXCEED SEEKING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE CAREER PATHS CAN BE ITERATIVE SO CAN WE VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HELP WITH THIS BILL. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND IF ANYONE HAS TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THE M. VETOES THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR SCHOLARS YOUR INVESTMENT BOARD HE'S HERE IF THERE'S ANY PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS OF THEM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. DO WE HAVE ANY IN Q. MODERATOR DO YOU HAVE ANY SUPPORT IN Q. IF YOU LIKE TO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO ONE FILED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE MOMENT MISTER CHAIR. AND NOBODY IS QUEUING UP. GOOD WE HAVE IN THE IN OPPOSITION HERE PRESS. MODERATOR ANY OPPOSITION IN Q. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. AND NOBODY IS GOING UP THE STRUCTURE NINE NINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE US A CLOSE SHARE ON. SILENCE SENATORS HELLO. I HAVE A QUESTION- AS THERE IS THERE IS A COMMENT- A AND WE KNOW THIS TO BE FACT IS THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING A HARD TIME RIGHT NOW. JUST PAYING FOR THE BASICS AND SO HOW MUCH DISPOSABLE INCOME IS REALLY. AT THEIR YOU KNOW- AVAILABLE TO THEM TO DO THIS- AND MY CONCERN IS THAT OBVIOUSLY THE LOWER THE INCOME LEVEL THE LESS LIKELY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE DISPOSABLE INCOME AND HERE WE ARE OFFERING A TAX BREAK. TO THOSE WHO ARE AT THE HIGHER LEVEL SO- HOW DO YOU. SOMETHING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS THAT YOU EXPECT THAT COULD BE OPENED BY IT BUT AGAIN IT. WITHOUT HAVING- A LOT OF FACTS IN FRONT OF ME. I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE OFFERING ANOTHER TAX BREAK TO THE HIGHER INCOME KNOWING THAT LOWER INCOME JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO SOCK AWAY IS A GREAT PROGRAM OUR FAMILY PARTICIPATES IN THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED FOR MANY YEARS. BUT I JUST WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS DO THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO INVEST THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION AND DINNER BEFORE ME TURN IT OVER TO YOU- THIS IS YOUR CONNOR- I COME I'M- A COUNCIL FAMILY VEGGIE CATERS I MYSELF AS AN EDUCATOR FOR OVER A DECADE. ALSUP TWO LITTLE BOYS AND THE COST OF EDUCATION- WE HAVE SEEN. JUST ABSOLUTELY SKYROCKET YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL FOUNDED CENTER- THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW FAMILIES- IN. A SALARY IN INCOME RANGE THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR EVERYONE OF FROM ONE HUNDRED FROM ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED AND THEN OF COURSE THE MARRIED. HOUSEHOLD UP TO TWO HUNDRED. IN A PERFECT WORLD WE'LL BE MAKING EVEN MORE INVESTMENTS IN OUR PELL GRANTS AND OUR OUR STATE SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR. FOR YOUNGSTERS TO GO TO COLLEGE I THINK I'VE SUPPORTED- MOST EVERY SINGLE BUDGET REQUEST BY C. ISSUE FOR YOU- OR- TO SOME EXTENT UC'S AS THE RELEVANT- FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE. THIS IS PART OF THE CALIFORNIANS PARTY AMERICAN EXPERIENCE THAT WE EDUCATE YOUNGSTERS IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR ABILITY- TO PAY AT THAT THAT IS FALLING SHORT IN MANY RESPECTS SO. I ACTUALLY EMPATHIZE- BUT I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF POLICY IN A MATTER OF LEGISLATION. THOSE ISSUES ARE PROBABLY BEST DEALT WITH ON A NEEDS BASED ASSESSMENT THROUGH THE CAL STATE FARM- GRANT PROGRAMS AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE GRANT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS FEDERAL. BUT I AM ALWAYS SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE AS WELL. AND YET AGAIN YOU THE SAN NOTED THE IS AN CAP IN THE BILL'S FOLK ARE MAKING FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE WEALTHIER FOLKS POTENTIALLY WON'T GET THIS TAX INCENTIVE ALSO I WOULD NOTE THAT A LOT OF THEM HAVE FOUR OH ONE K.'S ARE SAVING OUTSIDE OF FIVE TO NINE PLANS. WE FOUND FIVE TO NINE PLANS ARE PRIMARILY BEING USED BY THE MIDDLE INCOME OR TRYING TO FACILITATE LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS ENTERING THE FOLD AS WELL AS A REFERENCE MORE ACCOUNT OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN GROW OUR MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM IS TO SERVE THOSE FOLKS THAT MAKE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. OR LESS BYE WE MATCH THEM DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WE CAN GROW THAT PROGRAM WITH MORE MONEY COMING INTO THE COFFERS FOR OUR FIVE TO NINETEEN GROW OUR STATE PROGRAMS. BUT I ALSO WANT TO NOTE- JUST MEMBER NATION WE FOUND THAT IT'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT THESE ARE USED BY HIGH INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE NORMAL- THE AVERAGE ACCOUNT BALANCE IS TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS SO THAT REALLY GROWS FROM PEOPLE PUTTING A FEW HUNDRED ASIDE WHEN THEY CAN'T MAYBE A THOUSAND. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT MIDDLE AMERICA MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WERE HIT REALLY HARD THE PANDEMIC AND ARE NOT A LOT FOR THEM TO UTILIZE RIGHT NOW AS WELL. AND ALSO BASED ON A TWENTY FOURTEEN SURVEY WE CONDUCTED BY THE INDUSTRY RESEARCH PROVIDED BY STRATEGIC INSIGHT. CSF DID PROVIDE US MORE INFORMATION- AND WE FOUND DATA FROM ITS MEMBERSHIP SHOWING 70% OF THE MORE THAN TWELVE POINT SIX MILLION FIVE TO NINE PLAN ACCOUNT HOLDERS NATIONWIDE HAVE INCOMES UNDER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THAT IS UNDER THE CAP THAT SET IN THIS BILL AND THAT'S GENERALLY WHO WE FIND UTILIZING THIS PROGRAM. SO WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME MISCONCEPTIONS OUT THERE THIS REALLY IS GEARED TOWARD HELPING OUR FAMILY SAFE AND IF WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THEM TO PUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A HUNDRED DOLLARS A THOUSAND DOLLARS SIDE- IT'S REALLY TO GROW THOSE STUDENTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON. BUT WE'RE ALWAYS WILLING TO CONTINUE THESE QUESTIONS AS DIALOGUE THE TREASURES VERY VERY UNDERSTANDING OF IT SO- I HOPE THAT IS HELPFUL I CAN SEND. YOUR OFFICE ALL THE STATE AS WELL. THE PHONE UP. UNDER THAT. YEAH AND JUST IT. THE I'M SORRY THAT THE- INFORMATION THAT YOU JUST GAVE ME DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS. THOSE THAT ARE IN THE- IN THE LOWER INCOME BRACKETS. IN OTHER WORDS WHEN YOU SAY THAT THAT WAS A NATIONWIDE THERE BUT WE'RE A HUNDRED UNDER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. YEAH AND COMES UNDER HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. THAT DOESN'T TELL ME HOW MANY ARE IN THE LOWER INCOME. THAT JUST SAYS THEY'RE UNDER HIGH FIFTY THOUSAND WHICH THEY COULD BE A FIRE. THAT'S MY WHOLE POINT IS WE'RE GIVING UP A TAX BREAK AGAIN. YOU KNOW TWO BILLS THAT APPEARED TO BE AT THE HIGHER END I DON'T MEAN HIGHER LIKE IN THE MILLIONS BUT STILL IN THE HIGHER IT. WENT AND THAT'S MY WHOLE POINT. FOR TAKING. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE FAMILY HERE. OKAY THEN I WILL I JUST CONCLUDE THAT THE SENATE BILL THIRTEEN SEVENTY FOUR QUITE SIMPLY PROVIDES A TAX INCENTIVE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS TO A FIVE TWO NINE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM WELL I'LL BY ALLOWING FOR THIS DEDUCTION TO QUALIFY TAXPAYERS SICK LAST THREE RIVALS- EMOTION MOVED BY THEN THE WINNER. OKAY KALRA THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATORS CAPITO. NIELSEN AYE NIELSEN AYE DRAWS SO. HERTZBERG WIENER RIGHT WIENER HI TWO ZERO TWO ZERO LINK OF YOUR BILL ON CALL. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A- SENATE AND SALAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE SENATE BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH WILL ADVANCE EQUITY MEASURES IN THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAMS AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THE BILL AND ACCEPT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CURRENTLY HIGHER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO OWN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THAN LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR AND IRONICALLY THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN EMISSIONS OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE MOST NEED. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM IS SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING INEQUITY IN ACCESS TO CLEAN ZERO EMISSION AND HYBRID VEHICLES OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS CLEAN CARS FOR ALL HAS REPLACED OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND EVEN ZERO EMISSION AND HYBRID VEHICLES AND TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS REPLACING OLDER HEAVY POLLUTING VEHICLES. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL LOWER THE COST TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM BY EXEMPTING CARS BOUGHT AND SOLD THROUGH THE PROGRAM FROM STATE PROPERTY TAXES WAIVING THE THREE POINT PROGRAM MORE AFFORDABLE FOR ALL. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE- THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO IDENTIFY CURRENTLY UNDERSERVED GROUPS AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE OUT REACH AND LOWER BARRIERS FOR THOSE GROUPS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY I HAVE MISTER ALLEN ABS OF THE LEGISLATIVE THERE ARE OFFICER FOR THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND AS WELL AS CHRIS CHAVEZ FROM THE COALITION FOR CLEAN IT CLEANER WHO SHOULD BE ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE THANK YOU IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE HERE PRESENT THOUGH CORRECT YES MISTER ACCESS HERE. PLEASE GOOD MORNING VICE CHAIR NIELSEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M ALLEN ABS FOR THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO. AND TO EXPLAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF A CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM IN THE BAY AREA TO SUPPORT EQUITY IN ADVANCING A CLEAN CAR FUTURE. CLEAN CARS FOR ALL TO RETIRE AND REPLACE PROGRAM WHERE INCOME QUALIFIED RESIDENTS IN COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY POLLUTION. CAN TURN AN OLDER VEHICLE AND GET AN INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE OR LEASE A HYBRID PLUG IN HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAT IS EIGHT YEARS OLDER NEWER. IN THE THREE YEARS THAT THE BAY AREA A QB IS ADMINISTERED THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE SUPPORTED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED VEHICLE PURCHASES. WITH TWO THIRDS OF THOSE OCURRING IN OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY WE AVERAGE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED V. VEHICLE PURCHASES A MONTH. THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND BICKEL CHOSEN DETERMINES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU CAN RECEIVE FROM THIS PROGRAM WITH GRANTS RANGING FROM FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS DEPENDING ON INCOME IN THE VEHICLE. BUT THE AVERAGE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL VEHICLE CURRENTLY COSTS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS WHILE THE AVERAGE. CLEAN CARS FOR ALL INCENTIVE IS ONLY EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH AVERAGE LOAN FINANCING FOR PURCHASING THE VEHICLE BEING FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THUS IT STILL REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE FOR MOST ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS. PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE OR LIMITING THE TAX BURDEN ON INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM WOULD HELP EXPAND THE APPLICANT POOL. REDUCE PARTICIPANT COSTS AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S EQUITY IN ZERO EMISSION GOALS. I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND- THANK YOU TO SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WHEN YOU. AND YOU HAVE A WITNESS IN Q. YES KRISTER KRISTOFFERSON THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR VERY GOOD MISTER CHAVEZ THE FLOOR'S YOURS. GREAT GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS KRISH FATHER'S NINETY DEPUTY POLICY DIRECTOR COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. I'M ALSO CONFIGURED THE SENDER GONZALEZ IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE HER FOR OFFERING THIS BILL. WE SUPPORT SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM HELPS LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND POOR ENVIRONMENTALLY BURDEN COMMUNITIES WITH HIGHER THEIR OLD POLLUTING VEHICLES AND REPLACE THEM WITH CLEANER MODELS. LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE THE GREATEST BURDENS CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. AT THE SAME TIME THE FED TO BENEFIT THE MOST FROM CLEAN TRANSPORTATION BOTH FINANCIALLY THROUGH REDUCE YOUR MAINTENANCE COSTS. AS WELL TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN EMISSION REDUCTIONS. FIFTY FOR A TARGET HOUSEHOLD HELPFUL DISPENSARIES MAKING UP 21100% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. BOTH OF THE FUNDS HOWEVER HAVE GONE TO HOUSEHOLD AT 210025% OF THE POPULATION OR LOWER. IT'S ALSO WORTH HIGHLIGHTING THAT MUCH AS HE PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. THESE PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE SERVING HARD TO REACH FARM WORKER IN A CULTURAL COMMITTEES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO HELPING CONNECT A GREEN CARD FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS AND OTHER CLIMATE WITH WITH OTHER CLIENT PROGRAMS LIKE WEATHERIZATION ROOFTOP SOLAR. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO BUILD UP THE BEST OF THE GREEN CARD FOR ALL PROGRAM WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT MORE MUST BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THAT THE PROGRAM AND ACCESS TO CLEAN VEHICLES AVAILABLE TO MOST UNDERSERVED CALIFORNIANS. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY P. REDUCES THE COST OF PARTICIPATING CLEAN CARS FOR ALL I WADE IN THE SALES TAX VEHICLES BOUGHT AND SOLD TO THE PROGRAM. WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO WORK WITH THEIR DISTRICT AND LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP A TO REDUCE BARRIERS. THEY ARE CURRENTLY KEEPING MANY ELIGIBLE AND UNDERSERVED CALIFORNIANS FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

IN THE BAY AREA TOLL AUTHORITY WHO BRINGS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE. DELIVERING COMPLEX TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AND ISSUES THAT I DON'T SB THIRTY SEVEN IS A MAJOR CORRIDOR EXTENDING FROM U. S.

THERE'S BEEN RECOGNIZE BY CAL. TO BE ONE OF OUR MOST AT RISK TRANSPORTATION ASSETS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BE INUNDATED- BY TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY. ANYONE WHO'S DRIVEN ON HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN ALSO KNOWS IT IS SOME OF THE WORST CONGESTION IN THE REGION IMPACTING COMMUTERS VISITORS AND FREIGHT MOVEMENT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. ESTABLISHING TOLLING AUTHORITY IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS PROVIDING THE NECESSARY REVENUE TO IMPROVE RESILIENCY IN THIS VITAL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. FROM SEA LEVEL RISE AND FLOODING WHILE ALSO DEALING WITH CONGESTION PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS IN IMPROVING TRANSIT. OPTIONS IN THE REGION. THE BILL SPECIFIES THAT TOLL REVENUE WILL INCLUDE AN INTERIM IN OLDHAM IT PROJECTS. AS WELL AS ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION AND ADAPTIVE IMPROVEMENTS.

WHILE ALSO GENERATING FUNDS TO HELP ADDRESS LONG TERM RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF RISING SEAS WHICH STUDIES INDICATE WILL FULLY IN A DATE THE CORRIDOR WITHIN A FEW DECADES. FROM A GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT. THE BILL ESTABLISHES A NEW ENTITY THE STATE ROUTE THIRTY SEVEN TOLLING AUTHORITY TO ADMINISTER THE TOLLS. THAT RATHER THAN CREATE A BRAND NEW ORGANIZATION WITH THE SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THE BILL LEVERAGES. EXISTING RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE OF MTC BY DESIGNATING AN AFFILIATE OF MTC. THE BAY AREA INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING AUTHORITY OR BAY FAT AS THE GOVERNING BODY.

TWELVE NINETY ONE CREATES A PATH TO EASE THE INITIAL PERMITTING PROCESS RAJINDER FUELING STATIONS AND WELL THIS BILL PRESERVES- LOCAL AUTHORITY TO DENY A PERMIT BASED ON SAFETY TO PUBLIC OR PUBLIC HEALTH THE MEASURE REQUIRES. LOCAL OFFICIALS TO DISCLOSE CONCERNS AND OFFER SOLUTIONS WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITIES AND THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY TIME A FUELING STATION IS- PUT ON THE TABLE THAT- LOCAL AUTHORITY HAS FULL AUTHORITY TO PARTICIPATE. IN APPROVING OR DENYING. UNDER THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS FOR ITS HYDROGEN STATION PROGRAM PERMITS MUST BE SECURED WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT BASED ON DATA COLLECTED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE JOINT CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES REPORT SHOWS THAT GETTING TO ONE HUNDRED STATIONS AND THAT IS OUR GOAL. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA ONLY HAS FIFTY TO GET TO OUR GOAL OF A HUNDRED THE STATION SOMETIMES PERMITTING TAKES UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DAYS IN THIS BILL WILL OPEN UP IN STREAMLINED THIS PROCESS. IS CITY OR COUNTY WILL STILL ADMINISTRATORS APPROVED AN APPLICATION TO INSTALL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS OR HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF A BUILDING PERMIT. WE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR EQUALITY IN ADDITION A CITY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PERMITTING IF NECESSARY SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETY ONE WILL EASE PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT SACRIFICING LOCAL CONTROL Y. INSURING THAT ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS AND HYDROGEN. FUELING STATIONS ARE BEING INSTALLED IN ORDER TO KEEP PACE WITH THE STATE'S GOAL OF INCREASING ELECTRICAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE USAGE AND HYDROGEN FUELING STATION FOR THESE REGIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY MADAM CHAIR I HAVE- TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL TO RESET COOK ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ARJUN A COALITION. WELCOME THE FOURS YEARS HI GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR MEMBERS TERESA COOK ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- BY SENATOR ARCH ALETTA AS STATED WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US TO- ENCOURAGE CONSUMER ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE GIVING HOUSEHOLDS CHOICES BETWEEN BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES BECAUSE BOTH TECHNOLOGY TYPES HAVE DIFFERENT ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES TO MEET THE VERY DIVERSE NEEDS OF DRIVERS IN THE STATE OF HOW- IS THE- AUTHOR POINTED OUT- PERMITTING IS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR BOTH CHARGING AND HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO- TWELVE NINETY ONE WOOD AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING EASE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HYDROGEN FUELING STATION BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IF THE BUILDING OFFICIAL FINDS ANY SAFETY OR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED PROJECT WE CAN BE DIRECTED TO A- DISCRETIONARY PERMIT REQUIRING FURTHER REVIEW AN ADDITIONAL WORK SO. HOPEFULLY WE STRUCK A GOOD BALANCE WITH THIS BILL IF YOU WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS AND ARM ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE THANK YOU.

IN A MATTER OF MINUTES EACH AUTOMOBILE GETS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILES AND- ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AND I HOPE ONE DAY THAT ALL THE CAL STATE SCHOOLS ARE DOING THE SAME THING. HAVING THESE FUELING STATIONS RIGHT NOW AS I SAID WE HAD FIFTY WE'RE SHOOTING FOR A HUNDRED AND MAYBE ONE DAY WE'LL HAVE A THOUSAND TO GIVE EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE THE AUTOMOBILES THAT.

I HAVE FIVE EYES NO ZERO- WILL PUT THAT ONCALL AS WELL. BUT IF THERE'S THE- WE'RE ALL HERE OKAY WELL THAT BILL IS OUT I THINK THAT'S A FIRST SO FAR THIS MORNING- I'M A BILL IS OUT SO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER NINE CENTER ARCHULETA S. B. THIRTEEN NINETY THREE. AND ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. TODAY I'M PRESENTED SENATE BILL THIRTEEN NINETY THREE WHICH SEEKS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH DECARBONIZATION- CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING BUILDINGS BY REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONSIDER CERTAIN FACTORS BEFORE APPROVING ORDINANCES THAT WOULD REQUIRE GAS APPLIANCES BE REPLACED WITH ELECTRIC APPLIANCES AND THAT'S THE GIST OF IT. MOST OF US HAVE GAS APPLIANCES- SOME OF THE OF HOMES AND BUILDINGS AND APARTMENTS ALL HAVE GAS APPLIANCES AND YES OF COURSE WE'RE LOOKING TO THE FUTURE TO REPLACE TO REPLACE OLD BUT MAKING SURE THAT WE DO IT- AFFECTED BILLY. AND WITH PATIENCE IN THIS IS WHAT THE BILL IS ABOUT SIGNIFICANTLY- THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WHEN ADOPTING ORDINANCE THAT REQUIRED THAT REPLACEMENT OF A FOSSIL FUEL FIRED APPLIANCE WITH ELECTRIC APPLIANCE UPON THE ALTERATION OR RETROFIT OF THE RESIDENTIAL OR NON RESIDENTIAL BUILDING TO SIMPLY CONSIDER GUIDANCE AND BEST PRACTICE PUBLISHED BI ANNUALLY BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AGAIN THE BILL WILL SIMPLY REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONSIDER THE GUIDANCE IT DOES NOT MANDATE SPECIFIC OUTCOMES REQUIRE THE ORDINANCE TO CONTAIN SPECIFIC PROVISIONS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF ADOPTED THE ORDINANCE TO SUBMIT TO THE COMMISSION A COPY OF YOUR DEBTS AND WOULD STAND REQUIRED THE COMMISSION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE COMMISSION'S GUIDE LINES. IF THE COMMISSION DETER THAT LOCAL DID NOT CONSIDER THE GUIDELINES AND GUIDANCE THEN THE BILL WOULD ALLOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO GO BACK AND CONSIDER THE GUIDANCE MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS IF NECESSARY AND RESUBMIT THE- THE ORDINANCE WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING DECARBONIZATION CALIFORNIA HAS LARGELY FOCUSED ON NEW CONSTRUCTION IN FACT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED WHAT ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS REACH COACH WHICH ARE LOCAL ENERGY ORDINANCE REQUIRING MORE STRINGENT ENERGY REQUIREMENTS THAN THOSE SET BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY CODE. THESE REACH COACH WHICH ADDRESSED NEW CONSTRUCTION MUST BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HOWEVER THERE ARE UNIQUE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH DECARBONISATION AND DECARBONISING EXISTING BUILDINGS COMPARED TO NEW BUILDINGS THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION RECENTLY IDENTIFIED COST AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BERRIER ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION AN ELECTRIC PANEL UPGRADE MAY COST BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS PAID FOR BY THE HOMEOWNER OR THE PROPERTY OWNER IN A SCENARIO IN WHICH EVERY HOUSE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY REQUIRES ELECTRIC PANEL UPGRADE IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. THIS DOES NOT EVEN INCLUDE THE COST OF THE APPLIANCE IN THE INSULATION THESE COSTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THESE COMMUNITIES FACE ADDITIONAL UNIQUE BARRIERS BECAUSE SYSTEMIC INEQUITY IN EQUITY A HISTORY OF LOWER ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND FINANCE A GREATER ENERGY BURDEN AND LOWER RATES. FOR HOME AND BUSINESS OWNERSHIP. AS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BEGAN ADOPTING ORDINANCES TO ADDRESS EXISTING BUILDINGS CALIFORNIA LAW MUST BE UPDATED TO ENSURE THAT THESE ORDINANCES ADOPTED WELL TAKEN IMPORTANT FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION I BELIEVE THAT BY REQUIRING LOCAL. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONSIDER STATE GUIDANCE. WE CAN ACHIEVE THE GOAL THEY MUST CONSULT WITH THE STATE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY BE AFTER THIS IMPORTANT BILL IS ANTHONY SAMPSON I'LL BE OUT FOR THE- A. O. SMITH CORPORATION AND DON- COPAY. ON BEHALF OF THE AIR CONDITIONING HEATING AND REFERRED A REFRIGERATION INDUSTRY AN INSTITUTE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A GOOD MORNING AND THAT IN CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER- ANTHONY SAM SOME SAMPSON ADVISERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE L. SMITH CORPORATION IT WAS MISS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING MANUFACTURERS OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL WATER HEATERS AND BOILERS. AND ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER AND SELLER OF RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL WATER HEATING EQUIPMENT INCLUDING ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP WATER HEATERS IN NORTH AMERICA- TURNING TO THE BILL SENATOR ARCHULETA ID AN EXCELLENT JOB SUMMARIZING IT SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW A COUPLE OF POINTS. FIRST I THINK THE RELEVANT CONSIDERATION FOR THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY IS WHETHER THE STATE OUGHT TO PLAY SOME ROLE. TO HELP GUIDE LOCAL DECISION MAKERS AS THEY SEEK TO ADOPT ORDINANCES REQUIRING OTHER REPLACEMENT OF GAS TO ELECTRIC APPLIANCES AS A SENATOR NOTED THERE'S A LOT OF UNIQUE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING THE EXISTING BUILT ENVIRONMENT TO ELECTRIC. AS TO THE NEW NEW CONSTRUCTION AND SB THIRTEEN NINETY THREE IS SIMPLY AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THOSE CHALLENGES ARE CONSIDERED. AND RELATED TO THAT ALL THIS WANT TO READ RATE ONE POINT- THAT THE SENATOR NOTED WHICH IS THE CURRENT LAW. REQUIRES LOCAL STATE SEEK TO ADOPT REACH CODE ORDINANCES ADDRESSING NEW CONSTRUCTION TO GO THROUGH REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. NO SUCH REQUIREMENT EXISTS FOR THESE TYPES OF ORDINANCES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY EVEN THOUGH DECARBONIZING THE EXISTING BUILT MEANT IS FAR MORE CHALLENGING AND COMPLICATED. SB THIRTEEN NINETY THREE SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THAT PROCESS AND IT DOES SO BY MERELY REQUIRING LOCALS TO CONSIDER NOT ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED NOT FOLLOW SIMPLY CONSIDER CEEC GUIDANCE WITHOUT MANDATING. OUTCOMES I'LL END BY NOTING THAT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES C. SACK AND ENERGIES T. AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED LEGITIMATE CONCERNS WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL DURING AND AFTER THE LAST COMMITTEE HEARING. THE AMENDED VERSION WHICH WAS WORKED ON IN CONSULTATION WITH THOSE GROUPS WITH THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ON SIGNIFICANTLY AND WILL SHOW. AND THAT LOW HAVE BEEN THE FLEX. AND RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADOPT THOUGHTFUL AND PRAGMATIC RETROFIT REPLACEMENT ORDINANCES. AND ON THAT NOTE. WE ARE- AND I YOU KNOW I COULD SPEAK FOR THE CENTER VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THEIR REMAINING CONCERNS AND JUST ONE AGAIN THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE STAFF.

SO HAVING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IMPROVES HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CALIFORNIA HAS DONE GREAT WORK IN LEADING THE WAY IN REDUCING THE UNINSURED RATE IN THE STATE AS CENTER MENTIONED- THIS WOULD BENEFIT THOSE WHO ARE UNINSURED AND PROVIDE THEM WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE VARIOUS HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OPTIONS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE AVALABLE TO THEM.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR- AND MEMBERS- YOUR WHERE WE'RE FACING MAJOR HOUSING CRISIS THIS BILL. TRIES TO PUT ANOTHER TOOL ON THE TABLE THAT- OUR LATE COLLEAGUE WHO LEFT THE LEGISLATURE BUT IS. STILL HERE- SENATOR HILL IN SPIRIT- TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ESPECIALLY THE KIND THAT DOESN'T COST THE STATE ANYTHING THAT NONPROFITS ARE DEVELOPING FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME RESIDENTS- THAT WE- TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR- FOR THOSE KINDS OF EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOW HOUSEHOLDS. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ONLY TWENTY FOUR FOUR DOUBLE HOMES IN THE ENTIRE STATE AVAILABLE FOR EXTREMELY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND WE NEED TO DO BETTER ABOUT THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS WHO USE PUBLIC FUNDS TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ARE AWARDED A 100% TAX EXEMPTION ON THEIR PROPERTY TAXES PROVIDED THE 90% OF THE RESIDENTS ARE LOW INCOME. AND THIS IS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE INCENTIVE HOWEVER THE PROGRAM IS CAPPED RIGHT NOW IS TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR TOTAL VALUATION SO IN THEORY YOU COULD BE BUILDING LARGER OR MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS- BUT RIGHT NOW THAT CAP HAS BEEN A LIMIT WE RECOGNIZE THE GOVERNOR'S. VETO MESSAGE ON A ON A TWENTY NINETEEN BILL- THAT I REFERENCE FROM SENATOR HILL WE WANT TO WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES GOING FOURTEEN FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE WE JUST APPRECIATE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS I'M THEIR DILIGENCE ON THIS ISSUE AND WE'RE TRYING TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD ESSENTIALLY. TREATING NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS THAT ONLY USE PRIVATE FUNDS THE SAME AS ANY OTHER DEVELOPER THAT WAS USING PUBLIC FUNDS- SO WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE INCENTIVES IN PLACE WHEN IT- GO BEYOND- THE CURRENT MAXIMUM OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS- AND WE THINK THIS BILL TAKES A MEANINGFUL STEP FORWARD.

THEY'VE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND THEY HAVE DONE THIS ALL WITH PRIVATE FINANCING AS THE CENTER HAS INDICATED THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IS HOW THEY'RE TREATED RELATIVE TO THIS PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION THEN THOSE NONPROFITS THAT DEVELOP HOUSING WITH PUBLIC FUNDS THAT ARE OFFERED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. WE SIMPLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT WE GET THE SAME INCENTIVE ON THAT THOSE DEVELOPERS GET ON THAT MONEY GOES BACK INTO THE OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM OF THE OF THE HOUSING IT ALSO GOES IN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RENT IS KEPT- AS LOW AS POSSIBLE. RIGHT NOW WE'RE CHARGING ABOUT FOUR TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR HOLE IN THOSE PROPERTIES WHICH IF YOU KNOW L. A.'S RENTAL MARKET IS REALLY REALLY LOW- SO WE HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT THIS BILL.

VIS THERE ARE POSSIBLE. WE'RE READY TO AT TAKE A BAR FINAL BILL WHICH IS ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN ON THE AGENDA HELLO. SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX CENTER WIENER THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN CALLING MY APOLOGIES FOR- OR THE LIKE- SO- FIRST OF ALL I WANNA THANK. THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING PRETTY INTENSIVELY WITH US ON THIS BILL IN THE LAST. WE ARE. ACCEPTING NOT THE CASE NOT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. BUT RATHER- AMENDMENTS THAT WE WORKED OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE I THINK THEY'VE BEEN- DISTRIBUTED ALSO SORT OF- SUMMARIZE THEM. ONE IS TO DELAY THE OPERATIVE DATE BY ONE YEAR OR SO TO GO INTO EFFECT. JANUARY FIRST FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- TO GIVE THESE- MORE TIME TO. DEVELOP LOCAL REGULATIONS- TO. THE NEXT ONE IS TO PROHIBIT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FROM ADOPTING AN ORDINANCE ENFORCING ANY REGULATION. THAT PROHIBITS RETAIL SELLING MEDICAL CANNABIS BY DELIVERY OR HAS THE EFFECT OF PROHIBITING- THAT DELIVERY WITHIN THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THE FOCUS OF THE BILL BECOMES DELIVERY- THE NEXT ONE IS THAT TO INDICATE THAT STATE THE INDICATE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- MAY IMPOSE ANY REQUIREMENT INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. IMPOSITION AND COLLECTION OF TAXES OR SECURITY IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AS LONG AS THOSE REQUIREMENTS DO NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF PROHIBITING RETAIL SALES. A MEDICAL CANNABIS AND THEN ALSO MAKING SOME CLARIFYING CHANGES AROUND THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION I IN THE BILL WE ALSO WORK WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY- COMMITTEE ON THAT. REPRESENT US OUR COLLEAGUES ON SB. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX- IT- THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS TO MAKE SURE- WHAT WAS PROMISED BECAUSE FIFTEEN MORE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHICH IS SAFE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS ABOUT PROMISES REAL. IF IT WASN'T IT WAS TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO THAT THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA LEGALIZED MEDICAL CANNABIS. UNFORTUNATELY TWENTY SIX YEARS LATER AND A LARGE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA 62% OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. IT IS ILLEGAL MEDICAL CANNABIS SO WE LEGALIZE MEDICAL CANNABIS. BUT THEN ALLOWED MASSIVE. LEGAL CRIMINALIZATION OF ACTUALLY BUYING OR SELLING MEDICAL CANNABIS I SAW THE EMPTY PROMISE TO SAY YOU ARE ALLOWED TO POSSESS AND USE MEDICAL CANNABIS BUT WE'RE GOING TO FORCE YOU TO BUY IT ON THE ILLEGAL MARKET WHICH IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED 62% OF CALIFORNIA CITIES A CATEGORICALLY BANNED THE SALE OF ANY CANNABIS WHETHER ADULT USE OR MEDICAL AND ALL THAT DOES IS FORCE PEOPLE ONTO THE ILLICIT MARKET SO IF AN ELDERLY WOMAN WHO HAS ARTHRITIS AND NEEDS CANNABIS FOR HER TREATMENT. SHE'S NOW GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON THE ILLICIT MARKET THE PURCHASER CANNABIS WITH ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES THAT THAT RAISES- AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ELSE THE CONS FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT BETTER THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO MEDICAL CANNABIS DOES NOT APPLY TO ADULT USE THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PROP SIXTY FOUR. PROP SIXTY FOUR- ALLOWED CITIES LOCAL CONTROL TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ALLOW ADULT USE PROP SIXTY FOUR HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MEDICAL CANNABIS- AND- WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS TO SAY THAT CITIES- ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CATEGORICALLY BANNED. THE SALE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS. CITIES WILL BE ALLOWED UNDER ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX TO PUT READ REGULATIONS PLACE. ABOUT TIME- AND WHERE YOU CAN- I DO THINGS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE IF YOU I NEED A STORAGE FACILITY TO DELIVER MEDICAL CANNABIS. I'M MAKING SURE IT'S NOT MAYBE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD CITIES WILL HAVE FLEXIBILITY- BUT THEY CANNOT GET ARE EXPLICITLY OR AND OF FACT PROHIBIT DELETE THE SALE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS- TO PEOPLE. WHO NEED A- SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN OPPOSITION FROM SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS AND WILL OF COURSE ALWAYS WORK WITH THEM- I WILL AY THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY. OVERSTATED AND THERE'S THE TRYING TO CREATE A PERCEPTION THAT IT'S EASY TO GET LEGAL CANNABIS ANYWHERE THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE AGAIN 62% OF CALIFORNIA CITIES CATEGORICALLY BANNED THE SALE OF CANNABIS- THIS BILL WILL MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED MEDICAL CANNABIS WHETHER FOR HIV. OR CANCER BIRTH RATE S. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN IT LEGALLY AND SAFELY I RESPECTFULLY ASK OPERATOR I'D GO OUT WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE AMY JENKINS FROM THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION- AND DON DUNCAN FROM AMERICANS FOR SAFE ACCESS. VERY GOOD WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DON DUNCAN ON THE GULF COAST FOUNDER AND A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AMERICANS FOR SAFE ACCESS WITH THE NATION'S LEADING MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND A BIG PART OF OUR MID MISSION IS TO INSURE THAT WE REMOVE AS MANY OBSTACLES AS POSSIBLE FOR CANNABIS FOR THERAPEUTIC USE AND FOR RESEARCH AND THIS BILL TAKES US CLOSER TO THAT GOAL A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME IF THAT GOAL STILL MATTERS IN THE ERA OF LEGALIZATION AND THE ANSWER IS YES- THAT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO THIS MEDICINE. AS THEY HAVE TO OTHER MEDICINES FOR INSTANCE WE DON'T- TELL A DIABETIC TO GO TO THE NEXT CITY OVER TO GET THEIR INSULIN AND WE DON'T TELL PATIENTS THAT ARE CITY DOESN'T PERMIT CHEMOTHERAPY. AND SO I WELL I DON'T HAVE A MISSION IF YOU WILL TO SEE TO IT THAT CANNABIS IS TREATED LIKE OTHER MEDICINES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION TWO FIFTEEN- THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T FORGET IN THE AGE OF LEGALIZATION THAT WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT- THERE'S SAFE LEGAL AND- LOCAL ACCESS TO CANNABIS FOR MEDICAL PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE EVEN IN THE AGE OF LEGALIZATION THEY STILL HAVE AIDS AND CANCER AND CHRONIC PAIN AND OTHER SERIOUS CONDITIONS. AND WE STILL HAVE AN OBLIGATION AND AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN ENSURING THAT- THAT ACCESS AND IT DOES BEAR IN MIND THAT THERE ARE STILL MAJORITY OF JURISDICTIONS AND THE STATE ASSEMBLY HAVE NO CANNABIS ACCESS AT ALL SO IF YOU'RE BEDRIDDEN OR YOU DO NOT HAVE A VEHICLE YOU MAY BE IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESSING LEGAL CANNABIS AND YOUR HOMETOWN SO- AMERICANS FOR SAFE ACCESS SUPPORTS AT ELEVEN SIX WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT WORK OF IMPLEMENTING PROPOSITION AT TEN AND SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL. TO HELP US DOWN THAT PATH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA. CANNABIS INDUSTRY. ASSOCIATION WE'RE VERY PROUD SPONSOR OF THE SPELL AND I DO WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED BY. A SENATOR WIENER WE WORKED VERY HARD WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO YOU. I TRY TO GET TO SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME COMFORT- IN TERMS OF WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE AND WHAT IS NOT. TO WHAT THE SENATORS POINTS- THIS IS ABOUT MEDICINAL CANNABIS THIS IS NOT ABOUT ADULT USE- WE HAVE THE LOWEST. RATE IN THE NATION AMONG STATES SUPPORTING ILLEGAL CANNABIS AT PER CAPITA- AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS LIMITED TO MEDICAL BUT I THINK IT JUST SPEAKS TO THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH TRYING TO- OBTAIN. LEGAL SAFE TESTED QUALITY PRODUCTS. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS ON GOING EFFORTS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MEDICINAL PATIENTS. AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. MANAGER MEMBERS RANDY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE PARENT COMPANY BETTER KNOWN AROUND THE CAPITOL AS KHALIFA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

TO LEAD WITH IN ENOUGH. MISTER MODERATOR RAIN HAVE TO ASK THAT BE CLOSE. VERY GOOD I WE HAVE TO LEAVE OPPOSITION WITNESSES CERA DOCKETS THE- COUNTY READ OF. ANALYSTS- I SAID THE END NO FROM THE LEAGUE'S CAL CITIES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIRTY CAD ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES LOCAL CONTROL CENTRAL TO THE PASSAGE OF BOTH THE ORIGINAL MEDICAL CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. AND CONTINUED AND CONTINUED ANDCOMBINED AND MARKERS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS REGULATION WAS NEVER INTENDED TO COMPEL THE SIDING OF CANNABIS BUSINESSES WERE LOCAL CONDITIONS MADE THEM A POOR FIT. RATHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WERE AND REMAIN A CRITICAL PARTNER IN CANNABIS REGULATION ABOUT WHO'S WILLING PARTICIPATION THIS PROGRAM CANNOT SUCCEED SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX WOULD DISREGARD THIS INTENT AND RUNS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IS COMMITMENT TO LOCAL CONTROL. SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX PROCEEDS ENTIRELY FROM THE PREMISE THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS FEARS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA THE BILL HAS NOT PROVIDED A DEMONSTRATE MEDICAL ACCESS BARRIERS ANALYSIS LOOKING AT TRANSITTIMES WE DEFY IF AND WHERE ACCESS IS AN ISSUE NOR DOES IT DEFINE WHAT ADEQUATE ACCESS IS. COUNTIES HAVE BEEN A PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND IMPLEMENTATION MARKERS THAT ENSURING CANNABIS ACCESS THIRTY THREE COUNTIES ALLOW FOR BOTH MEDICAL AND ADULT USE CANNABIS RETAIL WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR A TOTAL POPULATION OF TWENTY SIX MILLION OR SIXTY SEVEN POINT 4% COUNT. TWENTY COUNTIES YOU AUTHORIZE CANNABIS RETAIL BUT HAVE LEAST ONE INCORPORATED CITY THAT DOES AND IN MANY CASES MULTIPLE CITIES IN ADDITION A NUMBER OF CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY BRINGING ON BOARD REGULATIONS TO PERMIT CANNABIS RETAIL. THAT'S FIFTY THREE FIFTY THREE COUNTIES COVERING THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA FURTHER THE BILL APPEARS LOCAL CONTROL IN JURISDICTIONS THAT PERMIT CANNABIS MEDICAL RETAIL NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE BY SEVERELY LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO REGULATE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT COUNTIES AND CITIES FROM ADOPTING REGULATIONS BEING TO. TO I RECENTLY RESTRICT ACCESS TO BROADEN AND HIGHLY OPEN AND THE DEFINITION OF AND REASONABLE IN THE BILL A LITTLE MORE THAN A RECIPE FOR ON ANY MEDICATION FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. FURTHER AMENDING EXISTING LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT WERE THAT WERE DEVELOPED AND IMPROVED IN A OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS WILL POSE A SIGNIFICANT FISCAL IMPACT ON JURISDICTIONS I CANNOT BE RECOUP BY FEES. IN ADDITION IT'S LARGER RESTRICTIONS A SINGLE RETAILER OR DELIVERY SERVICE WHICH IS LIKELY THE CAPACITY SMALL. JURISDICTION CAN MARKET CAN'T SUPPORT CANNOT RECOVER THREE WITH COST JUST ONE OR TWO DELIVERY OPERATION. LASTLY I LIKE TO THINK THEY CAN FOR THE THOUGHT. CROSS AMANDA. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CRESSMAN OF ARKANSAS MORE OF A APPRECIATIVE OF THE AUTHOR ACCEPTING OF THE MOMENT. THE PREMISE HOWEVER MOVING LOOK. REMAINS THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU KNOW THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT LEAST ARE CITY IKANA WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX. WHICH WOULD SEVERELY UNDERMINE LOCAL DECISION MAKING UNDER. THE MEDICINAL AND ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS NOW CARISSA. IN CONSTRUCTION OF BOTH THE MEDICINAL AND ADULT USE FRAMEWORKS THE CRAFTERS RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL NEED FOR LOCAL CONTROL. PRIMARILY AS PART OF CITIES AND COUNTIES LAND USE AUTHORITY. BASED ON POPULATION BY REGION AND WITH THE STATISTICS ALREADY STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE. ROUGHLY SIXTY SEVEN POINT 4% OF THE POPULATION RESIDES IN CITIES AND COUNTIES. THAT HAVE ACCESS TO RETAIL. BASED ON THIS WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO STANDING ACCESS WITHOUT UNDERMINING LOCAL CONTROL PROMISED TO CITIES AND COUNTIES. UNDER MARKERS. PLEASE CONTINUE TO OPT INTO THE REGULATED MARKET EACH YEAR AND MANY HAVE A CANNABIS ITEM ON THE BALLOT FOR THIS ELECTION CYCLE. THIS TAKES MONTHS OF PLANNING CONSULTING WITH EXPERTS STAFFING UP ETCETERA ALL OF WHICH REQUIRES BOTH UP FRONT AND ONGOING RESOURCES. THE DECISION MAKING AND PLANNING PROCESSES ARE EXTREMELY NUANCED AND A STATE AS LARGE AS OURS CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. PERMITTING ANY NEW INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY ONE WITH WELL DOCUMENTED STATE REGULATORY CHALLENGES IS A COMPLEX MATTER. CHANGING THE LOCAL AUTHORIZATION RULES WHILE THE STATE IS STILL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE PHASE OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WILL BREAK THE PARTNERSHIP AND TRUST THAT BUILT THIS INDUSTRY. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WERE AND REMAIN A CRITICAL PARTNER IN THE CANNABIS REGULATION AND WITHOUT WHO'S WILLING PARTNERSHIP THIS PROGRAM CANNOT SUCCEED. SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX WILL UNDOUBTEDLY INCLUDE THE GRADUAL BUT CONSISTENT PROGRESS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE MADE TOWARD EXPANDING CANNABIS RETAIL ACCESS THROUGH PERMITTING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NUMBER. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE WILL MOVE ON TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE IS OR ANYBODY ON THE PHONE LINE THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. YOU MEDICARE TEST PLAN OPPOSITION TO S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME ONE EIGHT ZERO YOU ARE NOT THEY SHOULD DO SB. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX. I DON'T CARE NOBODY IS COMING UP THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL BRING THE BILL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS CENTER HERTZBERG. JANA RECONCILE THE POINT MADE BY THE AUTHOR AND THE POINT MADE BY THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES NUMBERS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIANS FOR AN EIGHTY TWO CITIES. AUTHOR THAT INDICATES WITH 62% WAS A PERCENT SIR THE- THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR CITIES THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR CITIES OKAY. SO WHEN YOU PRESENT IN TERMS OF YOUR COUNTIES WHICH COUNTIES ARE. ARE ARE YOU HAVE L. A. COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THAT SAYS YES BUT EIGHTY SEVEN OF THE CITY SAY NOW THIS EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES IN ACCOUNTING. SO M QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF THE POINT MADE IN THIS ONLY RELATES TO THE MEDICAL SIDE NOT TO ADULT USE IF YOU COULD. FURTHER ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THE POINTS THE FACT THAT THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA PASSED THIS CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF THIS COMMITTEE. HAS BEEN SINCE I CHAIRED IT AT SOME TIME AGO IS ALWAYS BEEN LOCAL CONTROL CONTROL BUT THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE- A LITTLE OVER THE TOP IF YOU CAN HELP ADDRESS THAT AT LEAST ON THE CITY SIDE OF THINGS THAT APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE- THE AUTHOR MAKES A PRETTY COMPELLING. POINT OF VIEW. ON THIS. ASSEMBLY PASSED ALONG TIME AGO THE VOTERS VOTED FOR IT. AND YOUR ARGUMENTS ABOUT PERCENTAGES IN COUNTIES CITIES AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS POINT FOR APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY WHAT WE DID IS WE LOOKED AT- STARTED WITH THE COUNTY TO LOOK AT WHICH OF THEM- OPTED INTO THE REGULATED FRAMEWORK. FOR THOSE THAT DID NOT HAVE ACCESS IN THE COUNTY UNINCORPORATED AREAS WE LOOK TO SEE IF THEY HAD CITIES WITHIN THAT COUNTY. TOPPED ENDED OPTED INTO THE REGULATED FRAMEWORK AND BASED ON POPULATIONS IN THOSE REGIONS WE FOUND THAT THOSE THAT HAVE OPTED INTO THE REGULATED FRAMEWORK ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 64% OF THE POPULATION. AGAIN BASED ON. A SPECIFIC DATA FOR POPULATION BY REGION WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT B. B. DATA THAT THE AUTHOR IS USING TREATS ALL CITIES AND COUNTIES THIS. LISTS OF POPULATE. FINALLY IN CITIES THAT HAVE HIGHER POPULAR. THERE IS IN TAX. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF. LIVE IN THAT REGION PARTICULAR MANAGER WITH FELLOW. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE- I'VE- KUNIS. CLOSE TEACHER AND ONE ONE COUNTY. BUT SEES MCGUIRE ON THE- OR SOMETHING. SO YOU POINT IS THAT- THERE'S AN ACCOUNT. BUT THE I THIS IS MATT. THIS IS MEDICINE BASICALLY FOR FOLKS. YOU SAY WELL BASED UPON POPULATION IS THAT REALLY AN HONEST ASSESSMENT OF THE NUMBER I DON'T KNOW IT JUST. SEEMS TO ME IT'S KIND OF A-A NOT REALLY ACCURATE BECAUSE YOU DON'T YOU MIGHT BE THE COUNTY. YOU MIGHT ALPINE COUNTY HAS NO CITIES RIGHT. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DRIVE EIGHTY MILES TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE DID YOU DO THAT DIAGNOSTIC IN TERMS OF. PATIENT CONVENIENCE AND A LIKE A LIKE TO GET SOME SENSE OF THAT BECAUSE- THE FACT THAT YOU GOT THROUGH IN THIRTY CITIES AND- IN. CALIFORNIA DON'T ALLOW ACCESS TO SOME OF THE VOTERS PASSED. FOR MEDICINE IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL THAT HAT'S AN INTERESTING COMMENT AND ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO A LARGER ISSUE OF AND RULE CALIFORNIA WHERE YOU USED TO DRIVING FOR. ANY SERVICES WHETHER IT'S TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SERVICES YOUR GROCERIES YOUR GAS EXCEPT TRACK. BUT ACTUALLY THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF REAL CITIES OUR WORLD COUNTIES OFTEN. TO PROVIDING FOR A WHOLE ENTIRE REGULATORY SCHEME. AND ACTUALLY IN SOME CASES THEY ALLOW A LOT OF THINGS LIKE CULTIVATION MANUFACTURING PROCESSING. BUTTON. RETAILS ARE PART. BECAUSE I'M NOT. THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES IT LIMITS. COMMERCIAL LEARN. AND THEN YOU'LL SEE SEIZE WITHIN THOSE. PICK UP RETAIL BUT NOT A OF AN OUTSIDE A LOCAL BIT THE- IN RULE CAN YOU. IN INTO CAN AND WE HAVE A FEW COUNTIES THAT. DON'T HAVE ACCESS THAT WOULD THIS WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT LIKE ALPINE WHICH IS THIRTEEN HUNDRD PEOPLE MOST OF PEOPLE ARE HEADING TO ELDORADO OR AND THEN BRING COUNTY TO. GET THEIR NORMAL SERVICES INCLUDING. POTENTIALLY THE MEDICAL CANNABIS WE ALSO HAVE THERE WAS ANOTHER COUNTY WHICH IS MAROPOST AGAIN HAS NO CITY- AND SO IT'S IT WILL BE CHALLENGING FOR THEM. TO HAVE ESSENTIALLY ORDINANCES FOR. RETAIL AND FRANKLY THERE WILL BE NO READ THAT GOES INTO IT BECAUSE- I MEAN THEY'RE NOT EVEN GETTING. BASIC SERVICES WITHIN THEIR COUNTY A LOT OF TIME SURPRISE HAD ONE MORE QUESTION- IT DOESN'T LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THE- MEDICINES WHICH SHOULDN'T YOU IF YOU GET. IT IS A THINKING ON THAT. SHOULDN'T YOU LOOK AT THIS IS TAMMY PHARMACIES ARE THERE. RIGHT IF YOU'RE GONNA GO TRAVEL TO A BIG BOX RETAILER SOMETHING BUT SHOULD THIS BE IF THIS IS MEDICINE RIGHT AND THAT'S WHICH ONLY TALKING ABOUT CORRECT SIR. SO SHOULDN'T YOU DO LOOK AT APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON TO SAY OKAY. YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO VERY FAR FOR THIS KIND OF MEDICINE BUT EVERY OTHER MEDICINE THAT'S REGULATED BY THE BOARD OF PHARMACY. YOU CAN GO CLOSER TO THAT SHOULD THAT BE A BETTER. ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF CENTER WE HAS MADE NO I THINK WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS I THINK PART OF IT IS THE PROMISE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING THAT SETS UP. WHAT IS ADEQUATE ACCESS WHAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD SO WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE. THOSE CONVERSATIONS MOVING FORWARD DEFINITELY AND I WANT TO SAY THAT IS PART OF THE REASON THAT WE- FOUGHT SO HARD ORIGINALLY FOR LOCAL CONTROL WAS MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITIES. HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE. DECISIONS THAT MAKE SENSE FOR THEM AND WE'RE GOING THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN REAL SUBURBAN AND URBAN AND BETWEEN COUNTIES AND CITIES. BECAUSE THEY ALSO ARE VERY DIFFERENT. SELL. WITH THAT AGAIN WE- FOR THE FIRST CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT HOW WEAK ALL WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE. GOOD THANK YOU- AND I THAT IS. THAT THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THIS IS THAT- AND I'M A BIG ADVOCATE FOR LOCAL CONTROL NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT- BUT HAVING SAID THAT- I THINK THAT THERE'S STILL THE RESISTANCE TO CONSIDER MARIJUANA PURPOSES. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT CALIFORNIA LAW CHANGED BUT- MAYBE THE MINES- ARE HAVING A HARD TIME WITH IT STILL WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE- THERE ARE MEDICATIONS. THAT ARE PRESCRIBED BY DOCTORS THAT ARE MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY HARMFUL TO INDIVIDUALS- THAT ARE ADDICTIVE IN A WAY THAT- THAT LEAVES DEATH THAT THAT ARE. AVAILABLE MUCH MORE READILY AVAILABLE AND SOME OF THAT SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS AND SO MANY CASES- I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL- AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS I THINK THE AMENDMENTS. REALLY- MOVE. NOBODY LIKES TO HEAR YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING BUT IT MOVES IN IN THE DIRECTION THAT- THAT I THINK WILL BE BETTER FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO- TO SET THE LIMITS AROUND- AT WHERE THINGS CAN BE STORED. TO BE USED FOR DELIVERY- BUT- BUT ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DELIVERY SERVICE IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IF YOUR ILL AND YOU WERE ABILITY TO IT TOO TO BE MOBILE IS NOT. NOT THERE THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT- TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT WHAT IS A ARE A RELATIVELY- WELL WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD MEDICATION FOR MANY OF THESE VERY SERIOUS ILLNESSES. BENJAMIN THE BILL. THERE IS A MOTIONS AND HERTZBERG YES THIS IS THE- CENTER THE RISE OF MAY BE OFF THE WALL KIND OF QUESTION BUT HE IS THERE- A BIG DIFFERENCE. THE AREA THAT COLD. ARE THEY THE SAME ONE THE AREAS THAT DON'T SELL IT IS THERE ANY KIND OF CONNECTION THERE OR- ASSISTING YEAH JUST CURIOUS I DON'T- SO IF YOU LOOK AT LIKE HUMBOLDT OR MENDOCINO COUNTY WHICH IS SOME OF THE BIG CULTIVATORS BAY- I THINK- LESS OF AN ISSUE- I WILL TELL YOU THAT- YOU'RE JUST WHAT WITH RECENT WITH RESPECT TO THE TO THE OPPOSITION. TO DISABLED 67% OF CALIFORNIA IS LIVE IN A JURISDICTION THAT ALLOWS US WITHOUT A PROBLEM WELL THAT'S OF COURSE BECAUSE OUR BIG CITIES OUR BIGGEST CITIES TEND TO ALLOW THEM LA SAN FRANCISCO YOU KNOW SAN JOSE SEN SO THAT THAT'S IT WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY IT'S VERY MISLEADING WE HAVE WE ACTUALLY ARE HOPING AT SOME POINT SOON WE'LL HAVE AN ACCURATE MAP. THAT SHOWS THE AND I AM WHAT IT MIGHT TAKE IS THAT IT WAS SO MASSIVE SWATH OF RED AND LITTLE BUBBLES WHERE YOU CAN EASILY DATA- BUT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE TEN. THIS LITERALLY THE COUNTY AND EVERY CITY AND THAT CAN BE BANDS THAT THAT'S ALPINA CA MADERA AMERICA MODOC PLUMAS SIERRA SUTTER AND TO HIM OUT SO IF YOU HAVE HIV OR CANCER OR YOU'RE LIVING IN CHRONIC PAIN YOU NEED IN ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK AND IF YOU'RE NOT MOBILE YOU'RE REALLY OUT OF LUCK YOU CAN GET YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE MAIL. THEY COME OUT THEY COME OUT OPIOIDS DO YOU BUT YOU CAN'T GET HIM MEDICAL CANNABIS DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME IN ORANGE COUNTY WITH WITH IT WAS AT TWO POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION PEOPLE- LIVE IT TWO POINT FIVE FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY LIVE IN A JURISDICTION THAT BANS ALL CANNABIS REPRESENT 80% OF THE POPULATION ORANGE COUNTY. THIRTY THIRTY FIRST IN ORANGE COUNTY CATEGORICALLY BACK THE SALE OF ANY. INCURRING COUNTY 96% OF KERN COUNTY RESIDENTS LIVE IN A JURISDICTION WHERE CANNABIS SALES ARE PROHIBITED. BUT KERN COUNTY AND TEN OUT OF ITS TWELVE CITIES CATEGORICALLY BANNED. CANNABIS THESE ARE NOT TINY MICRO COUNTIES WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO TRAVEL. FIVE MILES DOWN THE ROAD THESE ARE BIG COUNTIES WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE TO TRAVEL FIFTY SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES. THAT'S INCONVENIENT FOR ANYONE. AND IF YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL SEVENTY FIVE MILES TO GET YOUR MEDICINE YOUR MEDICAL CANNABIS. YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST GONNA FIND YOUR GUY DOWN THE STREET TO COME IN CELLS YOU ILLEGAL CANNABIS. WHICH COULD BE LACED WITH FENTANYL. WHICH COULD BE UNHEALTHY IN SOME OTHER WAY WHICH THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN FROM AN ILLEGAL GROW AT THAT THE CHAIRS AND SO FOCUSED ON IT'S DESTROYING OUR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT REGULATED. SO I YOU KNOW I OFTEN DO BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL BUT WE TRUSTED THE CITIES. AND PROP TWO FIFTEEN APPROX SIXTY FOUR TOGETHER RIGHT. AND IT'S TRUST BUT VERIFY AND NOW WE'RE VERIFYING AND THE CITY'S OVERWHELMINGLY. HAVE NOT DONE THE RIGHT THING HERE. AND FOR WHATEVER POLITICAL REASONS-I'M NOT TRYING TO BE CRITICAL OF THE CITY THAT JUST HASN'T HAPPENED. AND SO WE NEED A LITTLE BIT. OF MODESTY STATE INTERVENTION. THE STATE FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS YOU HAVE TO ALLOW DELIVER YOU HAVE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET IT AT THEIR HOME- AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIVE OAK. THE YOU VERY. S.
