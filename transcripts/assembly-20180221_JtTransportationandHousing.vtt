MIGHT USE THOSE FUNDS THERE ARE

00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:49.473 region:rollup2

DO A LITTLE BIT OF WORK WITH OUR

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:01.686 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS IN TERMS OF MAKING

00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:03.054 region:rollup2

OF TRYING TO ACCELERATE THE

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:11.962 region:rollup2
TIMING THERE THE DECISION THAT

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:13.431 region:rollup2

00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:15.633 region:rollup2
IS TO.

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:16.767 region:rollup2
GET STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK ON

00:47:15.633 --> 00:47:18.302 region:rollup2
PUTTING OUT A FIRST.

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:19.637 region:rollup2
SLUGGER OF THE FUNDING ONCE WE

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:20.871 region:rollup2
HAVE THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR

00:47:19.637 --> 00:47:22.406 region:rollup2
OF REVENUES COLLECTED BUT WE

TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT'S

00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:36.354 region:rollup2
I THINK

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:37.421 region:rollup2

IS.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.642 region:rollup2
IT IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN

00:47:57.208 --> 00:47:59.477 region:rollup2

NEEDS TO BE USED FOR AND I

00:48:06.584 --> 00:48:09.653 region:rollup2
ALWAYS IN PERIL OR.

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:11.155 region:rollup2
.

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:11.689 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATED OCCASIONALLY IN

00:48:11.155 --> 00:48:13.124 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COMING FROM LOCAL

WISELY AND JUDICIOUSLY AT THE

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.616 region:rollup2
SAME TIME.

00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:39.817 region:rollup2

THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT SO SPRING

00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:53.684 region:rollup2
OF TWENTY NINETEEN GROW THE

00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:55.052 region:rollup2
ACTUAL CRASH CASH ON HAND TO DO

00:50:53.684 --> 00:50:56.353 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM. ANYTHING WE CAN DO

00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:57.588 region:rollup2
TO MOVE THAT ALONG AND I REALIZE

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:59.557 region:rollup2
THAT CONSTRICTIONS ON THAT BUT

00:50:57.588 --> 00:51:00.791 region:rollup2
BOTTOM WHEN WE TOOK THIS VOTE IN

00:50:59.557 --> 00:51:03.561 region:rollup2
THE FALL OF TWENTIES.

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:04.695 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN RIGHT TO TO DO THIS

00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:05.796 region:rollup2
I'D I GET THE SENSE YOU'RE

00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:06.630 region:rollup2
MOVING QUICKLY BACK THINK WE

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:07.531 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SHOW THAT WE'RE WORKING

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.199 region:rollup2
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:10.134 region:rollup2

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:11.502 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO VOTED FOR S. B.

00:51:10.134 --> 00:51:13.003 region:rollup2

TO INITIATIVE TO MY DISTRICT

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:15.906 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO HOMES FUNDING.

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:16.774 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE CONCERT

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:17.908 region:rollup2
THE LAST QUESTION IS CHAIRMAN

00:51:16.774 --> 00:51:19.176 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE TIME IS THE

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:20.844 region:rollup2
PLANNING GRANT FOR NO FLAWS.

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:22.680 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR SCOPING OUT WHAT THAT

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:23.814 region:rollup2
COULD BE USED FOR CURRENTLY HAS

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.016 region:rollup2
WHEN WE VOTED ON THIS IT WAS

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:28.218 region:rollup2
SORT OF GENERAL PLAN UPDATING

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:30.454 region:rollup2
KIND OF THING. I RECOGNIZE AGAIN

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:32.756 region:rollup2
THE SENSE OF URGENCY BEHIND THIS

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:34.858 region:rollup2
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IMPATIENT

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:39.196 region:rollup2
YOUNG MAN.

00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:41.131 region:rollup2
BUT THE IF THE IF THE DEMOCRAT

00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:44.001 region:rollup2
UPDATES CAN TAKE YEARS RIGHT IS

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:45.469 region:rollup2
THERE IS THERE ANY EMPHASIS

00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:46.670 region:rollup2
BEING PLACED OUTSIDE WE'RE

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:48.339 region:rollup2
BUILDING A NEW THREE BILLION

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.740 region:rollup2
DOLLAR LIGHT RAIL LINE IN MY

00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:53.243 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. YOU KNOW

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:55.346 region:rollup2
COULD BE A SPECIFIC PLAN FOR FOR

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:57.381 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AROUND THAT OR IS

00:51:55.346 --> 00:51:58.882 region:rollup2
THERE A WAY THE CITY'S TRYING TO

00:51:57.381 --> 00:52:00.751 region:rollup2
FOUR MINUTES SO THE STATE IS

00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:01.952 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FORCE COMMUNITIES. TO

00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:04.054 region:rollup2
REALLY LOOK AT WHERE THE

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:08.192 region:rollup2
PLANNING MIGHT ACTUALLY GIVE US

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:09.360 region:rollup2
THE MOST YIELD OF OUR HOUSING

00:52:08.192 --> 00:52:10.027 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.661 region:rollup2
USB TWO IS CLEAR THAT THESE ARE

00:52:10.027 --> 00:52:11.295 region:rollup2
THESE ARE PLANNING GRANTS TO

00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:11.895 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ACCELERATE THE SUPPLY

00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:12.496 region:rollup2
OF HOUSING AND RECIPIES THESE

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:13.063 region:rollup2
FUNDS WILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:13.631 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT THESE ARTISTS ARE

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:13.964 region:rollup2
TAKING OR PLAN OFF THE SHELF

00:52:13.631 --> 00:52:14.498 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:15.132 region:rollup2
UPDATING FOR THE SAKE OF

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:15.766 region:rollup2
UPDATING BUT THESE ARE ACTUALLY

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:17.534 region:rollup2
INTERVENTIONS THAT SHOULD LEAD

00:52:15.766 --> 00:52:18.369 region:rollup2
TO INCREASED SUPPLY.

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:19.003 region:rollup2
YEAH AND I THINK OF AS ONE AS WE

00:52:18.369 --> 00:52:19.637 region:rollup2
ARE GOOD PUTTING OUT TECHNICAL

00:52:19.003 --> 00:52:20.270 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE THAT THE BILL DOES

00:52:19.637 --> 00:52:20.704 region:rollup2
PROVIDE FOR STATE BECAUSE THIS

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:21.972 region:rollup2
IS RESOURCES. WE ARE

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:22.806 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING DOES AND TWENTY

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:23.474 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN SO WE CAN ACCESS OR TO

GET OUT AND WORK WITH CITIES AND

00:52:23.474 --> 00:52:25.175 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO HELP THEM. UP MAKE

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:26.076 region:rollup2
SURE THE APPLICATIONS THAT BRING

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:27.111 region:rollup2
THE OF PLANNING GRANTS ARE THE

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:27.644 region:rollup2
BEST INTERVENTIONS THEY CAN. BUT

00:52:27.111 --> 00:52:28.278 region:rollup2
IT WILL ALSO GET A LOT OF

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:29.747 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FROM MANY OF THE OTHER

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:30.347 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT

CITIES AND COUNTIES WHO REALLY

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:32.416 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE PEACE.

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:33.651 region:rollup2
FUNDS WORK WHILE THE STATUTE IS

00:52:32.416 --> 00:52:35.085 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO

00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:37.054 region:rollup2
DO THINGS LIKE USE THESE DOLLARS

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:39.123 region:rollup2

HOUSING AROUND THE STATE BUT THE

00:53:18.796 --> 00:53:21.298 region:rollup2
FOCUS WAS A LITTLE BIT LESS ON

00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:22.366 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS.

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:23.734 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A CRISIS THAT HAS

00:53:22.366 --> 00:53:25.836 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

00:53:23.734 --> 00:53:28.038 region:rollup2
SKYROCKETED IN AND IN RECENT

TO HOMELESSNESS ARM MY

00:53:34.011 --> 00:53:36.046 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOUR

APPRECIATED THAT. PROGRAM A BUT

00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:48.592 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A

00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:50.027 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:51.829 region:rollup2
THE FORTY TWO PERCENT OF ALL

00:53:50.027 --> 00:53:52.463 region:rollup2
AMERICANS WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:53.831 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN HOMELESS FOR NUMBER OF

00:53:52.463 --> 00:53:55.766 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:57.534 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW

00:53:55.766 --> 00:53:59.069 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE THESE FUNDS WILL BE

00:53:57.534 --> 00:54:00.738 region:rollup2
GOING TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:01.772 region:rollup2
TRULY CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:03.073 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AS OPPOSED TO FOLKS

00:54:01.772 --> 00:54:05.509 region:rollup2
WHO? ARE HAPPY BECOME MORE

RECENTLY HOMELESS.

00:54:05.509 --> 00:54:08.512 region:rollup2
WHAT ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.114 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY IT'S OF SUPPORTING

00:54:08.512 --> 00:54:11.815 region:rollup2
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND WE IN THE

00:54:10.114 --> 00:54:13.450 region:rollup2
CONTINUUM OF CARE IN TERMS OF

BUILDING OUT WHAT'S CALLED

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.652 region:rollup2
COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM? THAT

00:54:15.052 --> 00:54:17.755 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ALLOWS THE

00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:19.389 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS TO PRIORITIZE FOR

00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:20.891 region:rollup2
ANY HOUSING OPPORTUNITY THOMAS

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.892 region:rollup2

VULNERABLE AND MOST CHRONIC AND

00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:24.795 region:rollup2

00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:35.666 region:rollup2
AND.

00:55:34.031 --> 00:55:37.834 region:rollup2
.

00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:41.438 region:rollup2
AND THAT STREAMING LIST WAS IT

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:42.840 region:rollup2
WAS SO INFORMATIVE ARE TOO MANY

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:45.876 region:rollup2
OF US INTO THE PUBLIC.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.543 region:rollup2
AND ON AYE OPENING AND SOME

00:55:45.876 --> 00:55:48.612 region:rollup2
WAYS.

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:50.113 region:rollup2
OF.

00:55:48.612 --> 00:55:51.815 region:rollup2
I WAS A DEPRESSING BECAUSE I'M

00:55:50.113 --> 00:55:52.983 region:rollup2
AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE BUT AND I

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:54.885 region:rollup2
KNOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IN A

00:55:52.983 --> 00:55:57.421 region:rollup2
MUCH BETTER DIRECTION BUT.

00:55:54.885 --> 00:55:58.922 region:rollup2
IT WAS SUPER ANTHONY BUT THAT'S

00:55:57.421 --> 00:56:01.225 region:rollup2
A BETTER WORD WITH SILVERY.

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:02.926 region:rollup2
OTHER FACT THAT ARE AS YOU

00:56:01.225 --> 00:56:04.628 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ABOUT NINETY SEVEN

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:05.696 region:rollup2
PERCENT. OF.

00:56:04.628 --> 00:56:07.865 region:rollup2
OF.

00:56:05.696 --> 00:56:09.333 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:10.734 region:rollup2
NOT MEETING THEIR BELOW MARKET.

00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:12.202 region:rollup2
RATES SO BASICALLY ALMOST

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:14.271 region:rollup2
EVERYONE.

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:16.673 region:rollup2
AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE.

00:56:14.271 --> 00:56:18.342 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE I.

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:20.177 region:rollup2
IT GENERALLY.

00:56:18.342 --> 00:56:21.745 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE NOT TO PICK ON

00:56:20.177 --> 00:56:23.580 region:rollup2
BEVERLY HILLS BUT THAT WAS ONE

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:25.983 region:rollup2
THAT CAME OUT MANAGE TO

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.284 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE ARENA OF THREE UNITS

00:56:25.983 --> 00:56:29.453 region:rollup2
FOR AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD.

00:56:27.284 --> 00:56:31.154 region:rollup2
.

00:56:29.453 --> 00:56:33.423 region:rollup2
AT AND.

00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:34.892 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S REALLY AND SAN

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:36.326 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO DID NOT MEET ITS BLOOM

00:56:34.892 --> 00:56:37.694 region:rollup2
MARKETS THIS IS A STATEWIDE

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:39.196 region:rollup2
ISSUE THE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:40.497 region:rollup2
MEAN THEY'RE BELOW MARKET RATE.

00:56:39.196 --> 00:56:42.165 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:44.134 region:rollup2
GOT.

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:46.069 region:rollup2
TRUE REAL NON LAUGHABLE RINA

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:47.905 region:rollup2
ALLOCATIONS FOR BELOW MARKET

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:49.740 region:rollup2
RATE YOU KNOW WE NEED HELP AND

00:56:47.905 --> 00:56:52.109 region:rollup2
SO. WHEN AUTUMN I DO WE NEED

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.743 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT DOCTOR STATES TO

00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:53.343 region:rollup2
DO MORE IN TERMS OF HELPING WITH

00:56:52.743 --> 00:56:54.878 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:55.779 region:rollup2
ON BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF IT

00:56:54.878 --> 00:56:57.114 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU MENTIONED.

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:58.282 region:rollup2
ARE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO

00:56:57.114 --> 00:56:59.716 region:rollup2
WORK REAL HARD TO MAKE SURE

00:56:58.282 --> 00:57:01.952 region:rollup2
WE'RE GIVING COMMUNITIES TOOLS

00:56:59.716 --> 00:57:03.053 region:rollup2
TO BUILD. AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR

00:57:01.952 --> 00:57:04.054 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME PEOPLE.

00:57:03.053 --> 00:57:07.457 region:rollup2
IS THE.

00:57:04.054 --> 00:57:09.393 region:rollup2
OF WILL MARKET RATE PORTION OF

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:12.396 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE OUR FOR OUR MIDDLE

00:57:09.393 --> 00:57:14.131 region:rollup2
CLASS AYE WE'RE NEVER GONNA YOU

00:57:12.396 --> 00:57:16.033 region:rollup2
MIGHT YOU SUBSIDIZE OUR WAY. OUT

00:57:14.131 --> 00:57:18.268 region:rollup2
OF A PROBLEM AND OUR HOUSING

00:57:16.033 --> 00:57:19.403 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES I AM IN MY VIEW NEED

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:21.471 region:rollup2
TO BE REALLY FOCUSED ON ALL

00:57:19.403 --> 00:57:22.873 region:rollup2
INCOME PEOPLE. ARTICLES A MARKET

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:24.975 region:rollup2
WILL NOT PRODUCE HOUSING IN MANY

00:57:22.873 --> 00:57:26.643 region:rollup2
AREAS AFFORDABLE. TO LOW INCOME

00:57:24.975 --> 00:57:28.679 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ODD BUT FOR THE MIDDLE

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:31.848 region:rollup2
CLASS WE JUST NEED MORE HOUSING

00:57:28.679 --> 00:57:33.083 region:rollup2
AND. I WE HAVE A DEFICIT

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:34.751 region:rollup2
APPROACHING FOUR MILLION.

00:57:33.083 --> 00:57:36.987 region:rollup2
UNITS AND IT GOES UP BY ABOUT A

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:39.022 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND. OPERA YEAR SO

00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:39.990 region:rollup2
IT SYSTEM AMASSING GAPING

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:41.792 region:rollup2
DEFICIT.

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:44.328 region:rollup2
I AND.

00:57:41.792 --> 00:57:45.896 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE STREAMLINING LIST

00:57:44.328 --> 00:57:47.831 region:rollup2
THAT A CD PUT OUT SHOWS IS THAT

00:57:45.896 --> 00:57:49.166 region:rollup2
OVER TWO THIRDS OF JURISDICTIONS

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:51.835 region:rollup2
ARE NOT MEETING?

00:57:49.166 --> 00:57:54.204 region:rollup2
I EVEN THEIR MARKET RATE GOALS

00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:55.305 region:rollup2
OUR AND OUR.

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:56.907 region:rollup2
AND IT SHOWED ALSO.

00:57:55.305 --> 00:58:00.811 region:rollup2
MORE I THINK A LOT OF US KNEW

00:57:56.907 --> 00:58:02.312 region:rollup2
THAT RINA IS BROKEN DOWN DIETERS

00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:04.014 region:rollup2
SO POLITICIZED THAT WE HAVE.

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:05.549 region:rollup2
CITIES ARE ADJACENT TO EACH

00:58:04.014 --> 00:58:06.516 region:rollup2
OTHER IN VERY SIMILAR WITH

00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:07.884 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT READ THE

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:09.152 region:rollup2
NUMBERS YOU'VE WEALTHIER

00:58:07.884 --> 00:58:11.755 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BEING ABLE TO

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:13.824 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE ALLEN. OF WITH THEIR

00:58:11.755 --> 00:58:14.958 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES ARE LOWER NOT RENEW

00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:17.260 region:rollup2
NUMBERS.

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:19.162 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK OF WHAT THE

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.298 region:rollup2
STREAMLINING LIST SHOW IT TO TWO

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:22.599 region:rollup2
THINGS IT. IT STARTED INCREDIBLY

00:58:21.298 --> 00:58:23.734 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PROCESS AND I THINK

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:25.702 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME

00:58:23.734 --> 00:58:27.037 region:rollup2
ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES AND SOME

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:29.239 region:rollup2
CITIES AROUND THE STATE IN TERMS

00:58:27.037 --> 00:58:29.973 region:rollup2
OF ATTITUDE TOWARDS APPROVING

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:31.675 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:33.343 region:rollup2
A BUT IT ALSO SHOWED THE WORK

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:35.078 region:rollup2
THAT REMAINS.

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:36.813 region:rollup2
AROUND JUST GETTING MORE

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:37.848 region:rollup2
HOUSING PRODUCED PERIOD AND

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:40.617 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT.

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:43.487 region:rollup2
ARENA ALLOCATIONS ARE FAIR AND

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:45.188 region:rollup2
EQUITABLE ON SO THANK YOU FOR.

00:58:43.487 --> 00:58:49.092 region:rollup2
HELP HELPING TAKE A CRITICAL

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:50.761 region:rollup2
FIRST STEP.

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:51.595 region:rollup2
TO OUR VICE CHAIR OF THE

00:58:50.761 --> 00:58:53.063 region:rollup2

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:59.069 region:rollup2
TRAILER BILL BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:58:58.135 --> 00:59:00.737 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE.

00:58:59.069 --> 00:59:02.572 region:rollup2
OUTLINES OF FUNDING FORMULA TO

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:04.441 region:rollup2
TAKE IN CONSIDERATION.

00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:05.742 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT IN MY OPINION TAKING

00:59:04.441 --> 00:59:07.310 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION HISTORIC

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:08.111 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS MADE BY LOCAL

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:09.079 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS SO WE'RE BACK TO

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:11.314 region:rollup2
TOPIC HOMELESSNESS.

00:59:09.079 --> 00:59:12.649 region:rollup2
.

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:14.284 region:rollup2
I BY REPRESENTS THE MEDINA

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:15.585 region:rollup2
COUNTY AN AND THE ADJACENT

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:16.787 region:rollup2
COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOTH

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:17.754 region:rollup2
COUNTIES BEEN WORKING VERY

00:59:16.787 --> 00:59:20.023 region:rollup2
DILIGENTLY OVER THE LAST TEN

00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:21.124 region:rollup2
YEARS. WITH LOCAL FUNDS TO

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:23.059 region:rollup2
REALLY TRY AND REDUCE THE

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:24.728 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS POPULATION SO WE

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:26.196 region:rollup2
LOOK AT A POINT TIME COUNTY YOU

00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:27.330 region:rollup2
KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE BELOW WHAT

00:59:26.196 --> 00:59:29.032 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING OUT OF THAT FOUR

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:30.534 region:rollup2
THOUSAND HOMELESS BECAUSE IT

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:32.569 region:rollup2
WORKED SO DILIGENTLY. OVER THE

00:59:30.534 --> 00:59:34.204 region:rollup2
LAST TEN YEARS SO MY CONCERN IS

00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:35.505 region:rollup2
WHEN THE FORMULA WAS OUTLINED IN

00:59:34.204 --> 00:59:36.373 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND WAS

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:38.542 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED.

00:59:36.373 --> 00:59:41.511 region:rollup2
BLESSED THE CONSIDERATION OF

00:59:38.542 --> 00:59:42.112 region:rollup2
LOCAL PROGRESS IN HISTORIC

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:42.345 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:59:42.112 --> 00:59:46.082 region:rollup2
TAKING A

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:48.685 region:rollup2
FEDERATION.

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:49.986 region:rollup2
CSUS SO BUT THE. SP TWO VERY

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:51.455 region:rollup2
CLEARLY ASKS THAT WE HAVE

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:53.123 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY IN TERMS THE

00:59:51.455 --> 00:59:54.224 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTIONS THAT WE MAKE. OF

00:59:53.123 --> 00:59:56.259 region:rollup2
WHAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

00:59:54.224 --> 00:59:57.060 region:rollup2
ASPIRES TO DO IS JUST CREATE A

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:59.196 region:rollup2
FULL OR.

00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:01.364 region:rollup2
OF THE MINIMUM ELIGIBLE THAT

00:59:59.196 --> 01:00:03.700 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS FOR PROJECTS PROGRAMS

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:04.301 region:rollup2
CAN'T COMPETE FOR THESE OTHER

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.202 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE ELIGIBLE PROJECTS IT

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.770 region:rollup2
DOESN'T.

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:08.104 region:rollup2
A NICE A STATE OR BECAUSE DIRECT

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.439 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.407 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.875 region:rollup2
ABOUT ARE EXACTLY THE THINGS

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:12.976 region:rollup2
THAT BE BUILT INTO ANY

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.644 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR FUNDING A NOTICE OF

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:16.113 region:rollup2
FUNDING UNAVAILABILITY. IN TERMS

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:18.048 region:rollup2
OF PRIORITIZING PRIVILEGE FOLKS

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:19.916 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE TRACK RECORD CAPACITY

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:21.518 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE AND IT CAN PROVE THEY

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:23.053 region:rollup2
CAN DELIVER.

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:24.654 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE CAN GET. BUT WE

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:25.122 region:rollup2
CAN GET THERE WHILE THE SAME

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.623 region:rollup2
TIME PROVIDING FOR THE

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.357 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.692 region:rollup2
JACK BECAUSE I MEAN OF COURSE

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:30.026 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALL APPEAR TRYING TO

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:31.128 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY AND I UNDERSTAND

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:32.395 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW THIS WILL MAKE A

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.697 region:rollup2
DIRECT IMPACT IN THE DISTRICTS

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:35.298 region:rollup2
THAT WE REPRESENT.

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:35.932 region:rollup2
AND IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.067 region:rollup2
THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:38.368 region:rollup2
ACTORS

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:39.870 region:rollup2
AND THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:41.238 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO REDUCE THEIR

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:42.606 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS POPULATION COUNTY

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:44.140 region:rollup2
THEY'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB IN

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:45.375 region:rollup2
REDUCING BY SEVENTY PERCENT.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.209 region:rollup2
SINCE I AM I THINK WAS TWO

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.477 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO TWO

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:49.746 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THAT'S A

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:50.714 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT. I'M VARIATION SO

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:52.816 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY LOOK AT AND THEY SAY

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:53.383 region:rollup2
OKAY FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE WERE

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.317 region:rollup2
HAVING THE DISCUSSIONS OF SP

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.385 region:rollup2
TWO.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.920 region:rollup2

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE COMING

THEY'RE COLLABORATING WITH OUR

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:04.106 region:rollup2
FINANCING AND AND WERE SEEN THAT

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:06.475 region:rollup2
COME TOGETHER. SO I I I'M OPEN

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:07.944 region:rollup2
TO THAT WORKS YES IT IS IT'S

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:10.680 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY WORKING NIGHT WE HAVE

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:13.115 region:rollup2
A PROVIDED DEEPER SUBSIDY FOR.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:14.850 region:rollup2
OF MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING OR

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:16.986 region:rollup2
WON'T WE JUST WE JUST DID

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:19.422 region:rollup2
APPROVE A PROJECT FOR IN THE

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:21.657 region:rollup2
CITY OF SAN JOSE. THAT IS GOING

01:14:19.422 --> 01:14:23.225 region:rollup2
TO HAVE MIXED INCOME. AND A SET

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:25.227 region:rollup2
ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR HOMELESS

01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:26.729 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AND SO WHAT THEY DID

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:28.531 region:rollup2
IS WHEN THEY CAME IN WITH THEIR

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:30.132 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY AND THEY ALSO HAD SOME

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:31.500 region:rollup2
OLD REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS THAT

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:33.069 region:rollup2
WERE IN THE PROJECT. THAT THEY

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.670 region:rollup2
WANTED THAT THE PROJECT WANTED

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:37.306 region:rollup2
TO HAVE RE SUBORDINATE

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:39.075 region:rollup2
SUBORDINATED AND SO IN EXCHANGE

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.176 region:rollup2
FOR THEM RE SUBORDINATING THAT

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:42.278 region:rollup2
DEBT.

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:44.847 region:rollup2
THEY GOT TEN PERCENT OF THE

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:46.148 region:rollup2
UNITS SET ASIDE FOR HOMELESS AND

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:47.683 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE VERY CREATIVE AND

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:49.018 region:rollup2
STRATEGIC WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:50.486 region:rollup2
WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND.

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:51.387 region:rollup2
HAVING COME FROM LOCAL

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:53.122 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AND NOW BEING WITH

01:14:51.387 --> 01:14:54.457 region:rollup2
THE STATE THAT I THINK THAT IS

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:56.292 region:rollup2
SO CRITICAL THAT WE WORK

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:57.393 region:rollup2
TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY SO THAT

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:57.960 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALIGN OUR RESOURCES AND

01:14:57.393 --> 01:14:59.095 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.762 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:14:59.095 --> 01:15:01.464 region:rollup2
YEAH I I.

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:02.965 region:rollup2

DID SAN JOSE SO SO WE.

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:10.373 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THAT KIND OF

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:12.475 region:rollup2
APPROACH WITH THE.

01:15:10.373 --> 01:15:14.343 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:15:12.475 --> 01:15:16.679 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:17.813 region:rollup2
SIR ONCE WITH THE WHERE WITH.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.414 region:rollup2
TOO BLAND AND THEN THE OTHER

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.749 region:rollup2
QUESTION I HAVE. FOR BOTH YOU

01:15:18.414 --> 01:15:21.250 region:rollup2
IS.

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:23.753 region:rollup2
.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:26.789 region:rollup2
HOUSING TRUST OUT HOW I OF

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:28.858 region:rollup2
HOUSING TRUST.

FUND PROGRAMS.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:32.528 region:rollup2
IT HAD SOME OF THE STATE

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:33.329 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE IS THOSE

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.497 region:rollup2
ARE THOSE.

01:15:33.329 --> 01:15:36.499 region:rollup2
UNITIES.

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:38.100 region:rollup2
.

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:39.668 region:rollup2
ACTIVATED.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:42.004 region:rollup2
AND THEY WILL BE ACTIVATED

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:44.106 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WITH SP THREE BUT.

01:15:42.004 --> 01:15:45.641 region:rollup2
HOW HOW WOULD YOU USE A HOUSING

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:46.642 region:rollup2
TRUST YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON?

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:48.644 region:rollup2
HOUSING TRUST.

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:50.312 region:rollup2
BETTER THERE'D BEEN CREATED SO

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:52.014 region:rollup2
MANY COMMUNITIES.

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:54.984 region:rollup2
YES WE WE OFTEN WILL WORK WITH

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:55.551 region:rollup2
HOUSING TRUST FUNDS IN TERMS OF

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:57.253 region:rollup2
THE THE FINANCING THAT THEY

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:59.455 region:rollup2
PROVIDE. AND I WOULD SAY THERE

01:15:57.253 --> 01:16:01.424 region:rollup2
IS A SPECTRUM OF CAPACITY

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:03.125 region:rollup2
EQUALITY AND CAPITALIZATION FOR

01:16:01.424 --> 01:16:03.893 region:rollup2
HOUSING TRUST FUNDS. BUT NOT ALL

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.594 region:rollup2
OF THEM ARE EQUAL BY ANY MEANS

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:07.496 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A NUMBER OUT THERE THAT

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:09.198 region:rollup2
ARE ROUTINELY. A DEPLOYING THEIR

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:10.866 region:rollup2
CAPITAL RELIEF TO HELP ACQUIRE

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:12.401 region:rollup2
SITES THERE PROVIDING THE

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:14.370 region:rollup2
CRITICAL SERVE SUBSIDY GAP OF

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:15.704 region:rollup2
THE BRIDGES. WHAT A PROJECT IS

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:16.639 region:rollup2
GETTING FROM FEDERAL LOW INCOME

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:18.274 region:rollup2
HOUSING TAX CREDITS

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:19.642 region:rollup2
PLUS THE STATE THEY GIVE THAT

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:21.310 region:rollup2
DELTA? THE MAKE SOME COMPETITIVE

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:23.045 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY COMMIT ARE PART OUR

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:24.146 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO PROCESSES.

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:25.114 region:rollup2
TO MAKE EVEN MORE SO WITH THAT

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:27.516 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TAX CREDIT.

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:29.552 region:rollup2
HAVING LOST SOME OF ITS VALUE.

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:30.853 region:rollup2
AND I THINK TWO THINGS AS WE

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:31.921 region:rollup2
LOOK FORWARD THE REALLY

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:33.656 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THING ABOUT ONE IS.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:35.257 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY S. B. THREE DOES

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:37.226 region:rollup2
PROVIDE FUNDS FOR US TO

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:38.327 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE AND IN DIRECTLY INTO

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:39.528 region:rollup2
CAPITALIZING THESE REGIONAL

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:40.563 region:rollup2
HOUSING TRUST FUND WILL BE

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:41.430 region:rollup2
HUGELY HELPFUL.

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:43.566 region:rollup2
I'M IN THE SECOND IS I THINK

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.900 region:rollup2
WITH SP TWO WE WILL ALSO NOW FOR

01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:47.269 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME SEE.

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:48.471 region:rollup2
FUNDING GOING DIRECTLY INTO A

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.338 region:rollup2
LOT OF CITIES INCLUDING SOME

01:16:48.471 --> 01:16:50.072 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT HAVE HOUSING

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.941 region:rollup2
APARTMENTS RIGHT THEY MAY NOT

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:53.476 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:54.076 region:rollup2
OPERATING A HOUSING PROGRAM. I

01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:56.612 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE A GREAT

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:58.280 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY BY THE COUNTY OR THE

01:16:56.612 --> 01:17:00.416 region:rollup2
CAN BE RE ETHANOL BILL WE HAVE

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.183 region:rollup2
RARE OPPORTUNITY SORT HIM SUSE I

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:03.219 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A GREAT VALUE

CONTINUED SENSE OF URGENCY.

01:24:29.498 --> 01:24:34.970 region:rollup2
AND TO FOCUS ON THOSE AT THE

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:36.138 region:rollup2
VERY BOTTOM OF THIS CRISIS.

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:37.406 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR

01:24:36.138 --> 01:24:39.207 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE STATE

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:41.843 region:rollup2
WITH OUT A HOME ON ANY GIVEN

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:44.913 region:rollup2
NIGHT.

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:47.516 region:rollup2
WE HOT WE'VE REALLY NEED TO BE

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:50.218 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL TO AVOID HAVING

01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:52.287 region:rollup2
TRICKLED DOWN HOUSING POLICIES

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:55.190 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:57.192 region:rollup2
WE FREQUENTLY. PRESUME THAT

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:58.927 region:rollup2
BUILDING HOUSING FOR ANYONE WILL

01:24:57.192 --> 01:25:01.029 region:rollup2
HELP ALL PEOPLE THAT NEED

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:04.066 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:05.567 region:rollup2
BUT I WANNA SORT TO YOU TODAY.

01:25:04.066 --> 01:25:07.502 region:rollup2
THAT MIDDLE INCOME AND

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:09.504 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE AND MODERATE INCOME

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:11.273 region:rollup2
HOUSING WILL NOT SOLVE

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:12.741 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS.

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:14.710 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR

01:25:12.741 --> 01:25:16.979 region:rollup2
HOMES IN MARKETS WHERE RENTS

01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:19.614 region:rollup2
HAVE GONE OUT LIKE THE BAY AREA

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:21.016 region:rollup2
WILL NOT GET BACK INTO HOMES

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:23.085 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE MIDDLE

01:25:21.016 --> 01:25:24.453 region:rollup2
INCOME HOMES.

01:25:23.085 --> 01:25:26.221 region:rollup2
IN THEIR REGIONS AND COUNTIES

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:27.756 region:rollup2
NOT THAT MIDDLE INCOME HOMES ARE

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:29.891 region:rollup2
A BAD THING.

01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:31.727 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK I KNOW THE VOTERS IN

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:32.894 region:rollup2
ALAMEDA COUNTY WHEN THEY PASSED

01:25:31.727 --> 01:25:34.563 region:rollup2
THAT FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:35.497 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR HOUSING BOND DID

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:37.466 region:rollup2
IT THINKING THEY WERE ENDING

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:38.800 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS.

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:41.370 region:rollup2
SO WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.837 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WITH XP TWO IS

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:44.339 region:rollup2
REALLY TARGETING THOSE

01:25:41.837 --> 01:25:45.607 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:46.742 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU SAY THERE FOR

01:25:45.607 --> 01:25:48.844 region:rollup2
HOMELESS THE OTHER THING YOU

01:25:46.742 --> 01:25:50.846 region:rollup2
GOTTA DO IS STOP THE INFLOWS

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:53.315 region:rollup2
INTO HOMELESSNESS AND INCREASE

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:55.050 region:rollup2
THE OUT FLOWS FROM HOMELESSNESS.

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:57.085 region:rollup2
IF WE BUILD MORE THINGS THAT

01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:58.854 region:rollup2
HELP PEOPLE LIVE MORE HUMANELY

01:25:57.085 --> 01:26:00.722 region:rollup2
BUT STAYED HOME ONCE.

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:02.090 region:rollup2
LIKE SHELTERS ARE SANCTIONED

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:03.892 region:rollup2
ENCAMPMENTS YOU WOULD JUST KEEP

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:05.394 region:rollup2
HAVING MORE HOMELESS.

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:07.596 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:26:05.394 --> 01:26:09.297 region:rollup2
THESE S. B. TWO DOLLARS.

01:26:07.596 --> 01:26:10.932 region:rollup2
AND HOMELESSNESS

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:12.467 region:rollup2
I AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:14.236 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THINGS THAT SHOW RESULTS

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:15.904 region:rollup2
QUICKLY.

CHIEF GOT A NUMBER OF MAJOR

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:19.274 region:rollup2

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:30.452 region:rollup2
CAN USE S. B. TO MONEY.

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:32.754 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZE THE RENTS IN THOSE

01:26:30.452 --> 01:26:33.355 region:rollup2
UNITS AND REQUIRED THE PEOPLE

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:35.090 region:rollup2
THAT MOVED IN THERE HAVE BEEN

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:36.691 region:rollup2
HOME.

01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:39.261 region:rollup2
IF YOU BUILDING YOU KNOW THAT

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:41.630 region:rollup2

RAPID RE HOUSING IS A GOOD

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:57.646 region:rollup2
STRATEGY BUT IT WON'T WORK FOR

01:26:55.777 --> 01:27:00.282 region:rollup2
THOSE FOLKS THEY WON'T EVER

01:26:57.646 --> 01:27:02.751 region:rollup2
AFFORD RANKS IN OUR MARKET.

01:27:00.282 --> 01:27:04.119 region:rollup2
SO FOR PAIN TO BUILD THESE UNITS

WHICH KIND OF BRINGS US HERE DO

01:28:36.912 --> 01:28:39.581 region:rollup2

HOMELESSNESS.

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:39.074 region:rollup2

.

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:34.329 region:rollup2
AND SO. AND WITH THAT SIDE OF

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:35.764 region:rollup2
SHELTER LOW BARRIERS FILTERS

01:30:34.329 --> 01:30:36.698 region:rollup2
VERY KEY TO.

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:39.434 region:rollup2

LONG TERM.

01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:52.948 region:rollup2
SO A PART OF THE BILL MISSIONS

01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:54.182 region:rollup2

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:55.650 region:rollup2

AND NAVIGATION CENTER IS BEING

01:31:10.699 --> 01:31:13.601 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SAVE COSTS FOR LOCAL

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:14.836 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:16.204 region:rollup2
TO SPEND MORE OF THEIR DOLLARS

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:18.540 region:rollup2
ON HOUSING AND WHAT SOME

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:20.141 region:rollup2

SO TAKING DOLLARS INITIALLY MAY

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:28.049 region:rollup2
BE A FRY AYE LOW COST INVESTING

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:29.651 region:rollup2

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:45.527 region:rollup2
JAMBOREE WAS AN ACTIVE RECIPIENT

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:47.095 region:rollup2

WITH AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY FIVE

01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:50.665 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT OF

EIGHT THOUSAND UNITS IN OUR

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:56.438 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO. WE NOW HAVE OVER

01:32:54.436 --> 01:32:57.939 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS

01:32:56.438 --> 01:32:59.240 region:rollup2
THAT LIVE IN OUR PROPERTIES.

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:01.443 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION OF

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:02.377 region:rollup2
THESE FUNDING SOURCES.

01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:04.079 region:rollup2
WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE LOSS OF

01:33:02.377 --> 01:33:05.180 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE

01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:06.681 region:rollup2
SAY C'MON WHERE YOU GOTTA MOVE

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.783 region:rollup2
ON FROM THIS YOU KNOW IT WAS

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:11.286 region:rollup2
QUITE AWHILE AGO NOW BUT. ONE OF

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:12.821 region:rollup2
THE SIDE AND SIDE NOTES TO THE

01:33:11.286 --> 01:33:13.988 region:rollup2
ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT

01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:15.356 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WAS A COUPLE

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:16.925 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:33:15.356 --> 01:33:18.393 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ONE IS THAT AS YOUR

01:33:16.925 --> 01:33:20.128 region:rollup2
WHERE THE HOUSING ELEMENT ONLY

01:33:18.393 --> 01:33:21.196 region:rollup2
REQUIRES YOU TO PLAN FOR HOUSING

01:33:20.128 --> 01:33:22.897 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO BUILD

01:33:21.196 --> 01:33:24.732 region:rollup2
IT. THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:26.301 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ACTUALLY

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:27.969 region:rollup2
REQUIRED YOU TO BUILD IT SO

01:33:26.301 --> 01:33:29.370 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THAT NOW WE'RE

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:29.904 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IF YOU DIDN'T

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:32.006 region:rollup2
BUILD THE HAVE AFFORDABLE

01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:33.842 region:rollup2
HOUSING. YOU COULD NOT BRING IN

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:34.375 region:rollup2
THE BIG BOX RETAILERS YOU

01:33:33.842 --> 01:33:35.276 region:rollup2
COULDN'T BRING IN THE AUTO

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:37.445 region:rollup2
MALLS.

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:39.714 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SO A DIRECT

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:41.082 region:rollup2
CORRELATION TO THAT REDUCTION OF

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:43.651 region:rollup2
TAX REVENUES COMING INTO THAT

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:45.386 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION.

01:33:43.651 --> 01:33:47.155 region:rollup2
SO THAT CAUSED THEM TO MAKE SURE

01:33:45.386 --> 01:33:48.690 region:rollup2
MANY MOST

01:33:47.155 --> 01:33:50.458 region:rollup2
EXCEPT FOR THE REAL BAD BOYS BUT

01:33:48.690 --> 01:33:52.694 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEM TO PRODUCE

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:54.462 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THAT'S

01:33:52.694 --> 01:33:56.331 region:rollup2
ELIMINATED ALONG WITH THAT WAS

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:58.066 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE STAFF THAT WORKED IN

01:33:56.331 --> 01:34:00.668 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS EITHER

01:33:58.066 --> 01:34:03.238 region:rollup2
RETIRED WERE LAID OFF OR REMOVE

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:05.607 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO OTHER POSITIONS SO.

01:34:03.238 --> 01:34:07.509 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS WE HAVE MANY

01:34:05.607 --> 01:34:08.843 region:rollup2
CITIES THAT OF COURSE NO LONGER

01:34:07.509 --> 01:34:11.179 region:rollup2
HAVE FUNDING THEY NO LONGER HAVE

01:34:08.843 --> 01:34:13.114 region:rollup2
LAND? AND THEY NO LONGER HAVE

01:34:11.179 --> 01:34:14.415 region:rollup2
STAFF THAT EDUCATED IN THIS IS

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:16.784 region:rollup2
KIND OF TAKING ME TO THE S. B.

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:19.087 region:rollup2
TO. I'M OPPORTUNITY HERE IN

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:21.489 region:rollup2
TERMS OF EDUCATION SO EDUCATING

01:34:19.087 --> 01:34:23.091 region:rollup2
THE NEW STAFF THAT ARE COMING IN

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:24.993 region:rollup2
ON HOW TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:34:23.091 --> 01:34:26.194 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS PRODUCED. EVEN

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:27.996 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO MIGHT OF TOUCH DID IN

01:34:26.194 --> 01:34:29.998 region:rollup2
THE PAST DID ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:31.332 region:rollup2
ISSUES RIGHT IS AT THE TIME THEY

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:33.134 region:rollup2
HAD LAND THEY COULD GO OUT FOR

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:35.169 region:rollup2
AN RFP THEY COULD PUT TOGETHER

THE.

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:30.378 region:rollup2
THE LEAD STAFF

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:53.167 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE'S. THE MOST.

01:37:50.798 --> 01:37:55.303 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY WE CAN HAVE IN THE

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:57.772 region:rollup2

SINCE BALLOTS OTHERWISE

01:42:50.398 --> 01:42:53.267 region:rollup2
SHRINKING.

01:42:51.232 --> 01:42:55.169 region:rollup2
IT'S GOOD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:56.470 region:rollup2
IT SO WE WE HAVE ABOUT TWELVE

01:42:55.169 --> 01:42:59.040 region:rollup2

TRIES OFTEN IN ANOTHER THREE

01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:10.451 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:12.653 region:rollup2
SO I I. GOT THAT BRINGS ME TO.

01:43:10.451 --> 01:43:14.588 region:rollup2
A POINT I WAS GETTING TOO FIRED

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:16.991 region:rollup2
UP TO MAKE IN MY EARLIER REMARKS

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:18.426 region:rollup2
ABOUT S. B. TWO I KNOW THE FIRST

01:43:16.991 --> 01:43:19.827 region:rollup2
YEAR IS DEDICATED TO

01:43:18.426 --> 01:43:22.363 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS BUT I THINK THE

01:43:19.827 --> 01:43:24.298 region:rollup2
WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN LOOK AT.

01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:26.200 region:rollup2
ONGOING FUNDING AND

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:28.469 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZING OR BURKE BOARDING

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:30.004 region:rollup2
AND I'M GOING COMMITMENT TO

01:43:28.469 --> 01:43:31.972 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS LIKE.

01:43:30.004 --> 01:43:33.941 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE JUST DO ONE YEAR

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:36.544 region:rollup2
REALLY ISN'T GONNA SAVAGE PEOPLE

01:43:33.941 --> 01:43:38.713 region:rollup2
NEED I'M GOING DEEP SUPPORT TO

01:43:36.544 --> 01:43:42.083 region:rollup2
TO STAY HOUSED IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:43:38.713 --> 01:43:43.150 region:rollup2
MARKET SO. I AT WHICH ALSO DOWN

01:43:42.083 --> 01:43:44.618 region:rollup2
THERE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:46.420 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT I KNOW KIND OF THE

01:43:44.618 --> 01:43:48.222 region:rollup2
FASTEST PATH TO GETTING THE

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:50.591 region:rollup2
MONEY OUT THE DOOR FROM STATE H.

01:43:48.222 --> 01:43:54.962 region:rollup2
CD. IS TO FOLLOW THE.

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:56.297 region:rollup2
ESG PROGRAM DESIGN BUT THAT

01:43:54.962 --> 01:43:59.100 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY ALLOW FOR

01:43:56.297 --> 01:44:01.669 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUBSIDIES AND SUPPORT

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:03.037 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHERE

01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:05.406 region:rollup2
THE CAPTAINS COULD DO.

01:44:03.037 --> 01:44:08.809 region:rollup2
THESE HOUSING TRUST.

01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:13.781 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY

01:44:08.809 --> 01:44:16.650 region:rollup2
ARE POLL OF STUFF TOGETHER ARE I

01:44:13.781 --> 01:44:20.054 region:rollup2
THINK THE ONE THING I DON'T NEED

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:26.494 region:rollup2
A COUNTY IS THE CAPITAL. ITS

01:44:20.054 --> 01:44:27.228 region:rollup2
CAPITAL SO I THINK THAT I THINK

01:44:26.494 --> 01:44:28.896 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THE COUNTY.

01:44:27.228 --> 01:44:29.497 region:rollup2
CAP THE CAPITAL.

01:44:28.896 --> 01:44:30.231 region:rollup2
I'M SURE HOUSING TRUST IN AND

01:44:29.497 --> 01:44:30.798 region:rollup2
THEIR OPERATING.

01:44:30.231 --> 01:44:31.465 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY CAN WORK OUT THE

01:44:30.798 --> 01:44:32.199 region:rollup2
BLENDS.

01:44:31.465 --> 01:44:33.267 region:rollup2
OF FROM.

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:34.835 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK SO BUT I THINK THAT

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:36.370 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IF THE I THINK IT

01:44:34.835 --> 01:44:37.404 region:rollup2
THE STATE KEEPS SP TWO FLEXIBLE

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:38.806 region:rollup2
TO COMPROMISE OPERATING RESERVES

01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:40.708 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU GET THE NEW MONEY

01:44:38.806 --> 01:44:41.609 region:rollup2
WITH A IS IT TO EIGHTEEN YOU SAT

01:44:40.708 --> 01:44:42.443 region:rollup2
DOWN. AND AND AGAIN I THINK

01:44:41.609 --> 01:44:43.144 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT REGION'S THAT HOBBES

01:44:42.443 --> 01:44:44.512 region:rollup2
STUFF IN THE PIPELINE BECAUSE OF

01:44:43.144 --> 01:44:46.280 region:rollup2
THEIR LOCAL BOND MEASURES.

01:44:44.512 --> 01:44:48.749 region:rollup2

CONTINUE TO FURTHER STREAMLINE

01:49:42.843 --> 01:49:44.878 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERMANENT

01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:46.146 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE WE

01:49:44.878 --> 01:49:47.548 region:rollup2

01:49:47.548 --> 01:49:50.517 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FAIRLY TYPICAL. STORY

01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:52.252 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:53.654 region:rollup2
UNACCEPTABLE WITH HOW MUCH MONEY

01:49:52.252 --> 01:49:55.322 region:rollup2

THERE IS A DIFFERENT

01:50:22.516 --> 01:50:25.219 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE A DIFFERENT SCHOOL

01:50:23.951 --> 01:50:26.720 region:rollup2
OF THOUGHT THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:50:25.219 --> 01:50:27.921 region:rollup2
WASTING MONIES.

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.956 region:rollup2
SPENDING IT IN THE WRONG PLACES

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:30.324 region:rollup2
AND THAT WHAT WE REALLY OUGHT TO

01:50:28.956 --> 01:50:31.992 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON.

01:50:30.324 --> 01:50:33.660 region:rollup2

THE LANE LOWER THAT MIGHT BE

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:44.638 region:rollup2
EASIER. BUT ALAIN YOUR COMMENTS

01:50:43.537 --> 01:50:45.172 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU WOULD SET WAS IF WE

01:50:44.638 --> 01:50:46.206 region:rollup2
STOP PEOPLE FROM BECOMING

01:50:45.172 --> 01:50:48.108 region:rollup2
HOMELESS

01:50:46.206 --> 01:50:49.576 region:rollup2
AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:51.178 region:rollup2
FOLKS WERE ON THE RULES TO GET

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:52.946 region:rollup2

01:50:51.178 --> 01:50:54.815 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS OUR OUR DOLLARS AND. I

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:55.449 region:rollup2
WANTED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:50:54.815 --> 01:50:56.383 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO OF

01:50:55.449 --> 01:50:57.985 region:rollup2
YOU.

THOSE TWO THAT DOES SEEM TO BE

01:50:57.985 --> 01:50:59.820 region:rollup2
TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHTS I MEAN

I'LL TELL YOU I COME FROM A

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:02.923 region:rollup2
CITY.

THAT HAS SPENT CLOSE TO FOUR

01:51:02.923 --> 01:51:06.059 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:08.328 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ADDRESS HE FIVE TO

IN ANY PARTICULAR.

01:51:09.630 --> 01:51:13.467 region:rollup2
TIME AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

01:51:11.732 --> 01:51:15.269 region:rollup2
MAKE IT DEBT AND SO.

01:51:13.467 --> 01:51:17.237 region:rollup2
A IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST WE'RE NOT

01:51:15.269 --> 01:51:17.771 region:rollup2
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT WITH HOW

01:51:17.237 --> 01:51:18.772 region:rollup2

SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:25.412 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN ALL

01:51:23.377 --> 01:51:27.147 region:rollup2
SORTS OF DIFFERENT FORMS.

HAVE TO SPEND MORE BUT I WANNA

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:33.153 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE'RE SPENDING. IN THE

01:51:32.553 --> 01:51:33.987 region:rollup2
RIGHT WAY SO COULD THE TWO OF

TEASE OUT THAT.

01:51:35.956 --> 01:51:39.359 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT I'M HEARING FROM

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:40.460 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT QUARTERS OF HOW WE AS

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:42.696 region:rollup2
POLICY MAKERS OUGHT TO THINK

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:44.765 region:rollup2

I'VE I'VE BEEN DOING SOME

01:51:48.235 --> 01:51:52.439 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS ON THAT INFLOWS INTO

01:51:50.437 --> 01:51:54.575 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS SO THAT. THE MOST

01:51:52.439 --> 01:51:55.909 region:rollup2
ACCURATE DATA POINT WE ALL HAVE

01:51:54.575 --> 01:51:58.545 region:rollup2
THIS THE POINT TIME COUNT WHEN

01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:59.713 region:rollup2
WERE WONDERING IF STREETS OF OUR

01:51:58.545 --> 01:52:00.614 region:rollup2
COUNTIES DISTRICTS.

01:51:59.713 --> 01:52:02.216 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR FOLKS SLEEPING

01:52:00.614 --> 01:52:04.318 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE.

01:52:02.216 --> 01:52:05.552 region:rollup2
BUT WE ASK THE FOLKS IN ALAMEDA

01:52:04.318 --> 01:52:07.621 region:rollup2
COUNTY HOW LONG THEY BEEN

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:09.056 region:rollup2
HOMELESS IN TWO PERCENT OF THEM

01:52:07.621 --> 01:52:11.725 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE TWELVE HUNDRED WE

01:52:09.056 --> 01:52:13.193 region:rollup2
SURVEYED. SAID A WEAKER LASS SO

01:52:11.725 --> 01:52:14.661 region:rollup2
WE MULTIPLY THAT TIMES FIFTY TWO

01:52:13.193 --> 01:52:16.897 region:rollup2
WEEKS

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:18.131 region:rollup2
AND ALMOST AS MANY PEOPLE NOW

01:52:16.897 --> 01:52:19.766 region:rollup2
WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR

01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:20.767 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS EACH

01:52:19.766 --> 01:52:22.769 region:rollup2
WEEK.

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:24.304 region:rollup2
IN OUR COUNTY.

01:52:22.769 --> 01:52:26.039 region:rollup2
AND THE HOUSE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:52:24.304 --> 01:52:27.307 region:rollup2
PEOPLE YEARS THAT'S THEIR FIFTY

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:29.243 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS THAT'S

01:52:27.307 --> 01:52:31.078 region:rollup2
THE SAME NUMBER WE COUNTED ON

01:52:29.243 --> 01:52:34.314 region:rollup2
THAT ONE GIVE THE NINE.

01:52:31.078 --> 01:52:36.149 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT MONEY STOP. AND SO.

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:37.651 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WERE WERE PULLING THE

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:39.086 region:rollup2
BABIES OUT OF THE RIVER AND NO

01:52:37.651 --> 01:52:40.253 region:rollup2
ONE'S GOING UPSTREAM TO SEE

01:52:39.086 --> 01:52:41.588 region:rollup2
WHO'S THROWING BABIES IN THE

01:52:40.253 --> 01:52:43.056 region:rollup2
RECORD BREAKING WERE BUILDING

01:52:41.588 --> 01:52:44.191 region:rollup2
FANCIER BOATS AND FAST

01:52:43.056 --> 01:52:45.459 region:rollup2
APPROACHING MORE EXPENSIVE BUT

01:52:44.191 --> 01:52:47.094 region:rollup2
TO GET IN THE WATER FOR THE

01:52:45.459 --> 01:52:48.829 region:rollup2
BABY'S GETTING THROWN INTO THE

01:52:47.094 --> 01:52:50.697 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ON THE STREET. SO YOU

01:52:48.829 --> 01:52:51.231 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT I MEAN ALAMEDA COUNTY

01:52:50.697 --> 01:52:52.899 region:rollup2
IS.

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:55.002 region:rollup2
HOUSING A COUPLE THOUSAND FOLKS

01:52:52.899 --> 01:52:57.804 region:rollup2
A YEAR BUT WE'RE NOT KEEPING UP

01:52:55.002 --> 01:53:00.774 region:rollup2
WITH THAT LEVEL OF. IMPORT SO I

01:52:57.804 --> 01:53:02.643 region:rollup2
DO YOU REALLY THINK LOOKING AT.

01:53:00.774 --> 01:53:03.977 region:rollup2
SO. I'M GOING TO TOUCH A THIRD

01:53:02.643 --> 01:53:05.045 region:rollup2
RAIL HERE BUT I THINK COSTA

01:53:03.977 --> 01:53:06.813 region:rollup2
HAWKINS

01:53:05.045 --> 01:53:08.749 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT TO.

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:10.617 region:rollup2
I'M THINKING ABOUT REPEALING IT

01:53:08.749 --> 01:53:13.587 region:rollup2
SAID THAT TALK ABOUT LOCAL

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:15.355 region:rollup2
CONTROL. LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND

01:53:13.587 --> 01:53:17.658 region:rollup2
RENDER PROTECTIONS BECAUSE WE

01:53:15.355 --> 01:53:19.426 region:rollup2
ARE JUST KICKING PEOPLE OUT OF

01:53:17.658 --> 01:53:20.761 region:rollup2
RENTAL HOUSING IN OUR COUNTIES

01:53:19.426 --> 01:53:24.264 region:rollup2
FROM BECAUSE FREEZING FROM

01:53:20.761 --> 01:53:25.899 region:rollup2
CONVERSION. AND DISPLACEMENT AND

01:53:24.264 --> 01:53:27.668 region:rollup2
WERE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH A

01:53:25.899 --> 01:53:29.336 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY FUNDED AFFORDABLE

01:53:27.668 --> 01:53:30.871 region:rollup2
HOUSING SAID THE PRIVATE MARKET

01:53:29.336 --> 01:53:32.673 region:rollup2
IS JUST KICKING PEOPLE INTO

01:53:30.871 --> 01:53:34.808 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS SO WE CANNOT. WE

01:53:32.673 --> 01:53:35.442 region:rollup2
GOT TO TAKE SOME ACTION TO

01:53:34.808 --> 01:53:38.045 region:rollup2
STABILIZE THAT.

01:53:35.442 --> 01:53:39.846 region:rollup2
PRIVATE MARKETS I WOULD SAY

01:53:38.045 --> 01:53:42.449 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE A DEFINITE.

01:53:39.846 --> 01:53:43.950 region:rollup2
SOURCE FOR PEOPLE BECOMING

01:53:42.449 --> 01:53:45.552 region:rollup2
HOMELESS AND THEN I THINK WE CAN

01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:47.120 region:rollup2
TAKE SOME ACTIONS IN THE

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:50.557 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:52.125 region:rollup2
FIELD TO HELP SUBSIDIZE IT MORE

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:54.061 region:rollup2
DEEPLY SO THAT REALLY POOR

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:55.796 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN GET INTO THE UNITS

01:53:54.061 --> 01:53:58.198 region:rollup2
WERE SPENDING PUBLIC DOLLARS TO

01:53:55.796 --> 01:53:59.800 region:rollup2
BAIL AND. SO I'M I'M NOT SURE

01:53:58.198 --> 01:54:02.469 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT

01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:03.670 region:rollup2
THINGS HERE I JUST I THINK WE'RE

01:54:02.469 --> 01:54:05.205 region:rollup2
WE'RE SAYING THAT.

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:07.174 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:09.042 region:rollup2
HAVE THE COSTS THEY HAVE.

01:54:07.174 --> 01:54:10.877 region:rollup2
IT COSTS A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

01:54:09.042 --> 01:54:13.747 region:rollup2
RUN THE UNIT IN THESE. URBAN

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:15.749 region:rollup2
MARKETS AND A PERSON ON SS I CAN

01:54:13.747 --> 01:54:16.316 region:rollup2
ONLY AFFORD TO PAY THREE HUNDRED

01:54:15.749 --> 01:54:18.151 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE UP THE

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:20.253 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE.

01:54:18.151 --> 01:54:21.355 region:rollup2
YEAH I MEAN I'VE.

01:54:20.253 --> 01:54:24.091 region:rollup2
FOCUS WILL ALWAYS BE ON

01:54:21.355 --> 01:54:26.693 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION BECAUSE I THINK WHERE

01:54:24.091 --> 01:54:27.861 region:rollup2
EVER YOU ARE AT THE MORE UNITS

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:29.329 region:rollup2
IN THE MORE CHOICE YOU HAVE THAT

01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:31.264 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE.

01:54:29.329 --> 01:54:33.100 region:rollup2
APPLY DEMAND COMING INTO PLACE

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:35.369 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WHEN YOU GET TO THE

01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:37.671 region:rollup2
MOST VULNERABLE THOSE WHO ARE

01:54:35.369 --> 01:54:39.005 region:rollup2
LIVING WITH DISABILITIES. THOSE

01:54:37.671 --> 01:54:40.340 region:rollup2
IN THE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME

01:54:39.005 --> 01:54:42.342 region:rollup2
CATEGORY THAT CHRONICALLY

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:45.846 region:rollup2
HOMELESS.

01:54:42.342 --> 01:54:48.648 region:rollup2
I THINK IT GETS AWFULLY TOUGH.

01:54:45.846 --> 01:54:50.484 region:rollup2
TO WORK TO KEEP THEM IN UNITS

01:54:48.648 --> 01:54:52.619 region:rollup2
WITH OUT FULL SUPPORT OF

01:54:50.484 --> 01:54:54.521 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND MAYBE THAT'S IT YOU

01:54:52.619 --> 01:54:57.023 region:rollup2
KNOW IN IMPLEMENTATION. BY I

01:54:54.521 --> 01:54:58.959 region:rollup2
WOULD. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT.

01:54:57.023 --> 01:55:00.527 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:54:58.959 --> 01:55:02.496 region:rollup2
GIVING THEM THE MOST FLEXIBILITY

01:55:00.527 --> 01:55:04.264 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE SOME OF THE FUNDING

01:55:02.496 --> 01:55:05.899 region:rollup2
THAT THEY GET CAN BE USED WE HAD

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:08.301 region:rollup2
WHEN I WENT CITY I WORKED FOR

01:55:05.899 --> 01:55:10.604 region:rollup2
HAD A. EMERGENCY GRANT PROGRAM

01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:11.772 region:rollup2
FOR ONE FOR ONE MONTH RIGHT SO

01:55:10.604 --> 01:55:13.273 region:rollup2
IF ONE MONTH.

01:55:11.772 --> 01:55:15.742 region:rollup2
BRENT AND THERE HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:17.677 region:rollup2
ARE AWAY FROM ONE PAYCHECK FROM

01:55:15.742 --> 01:55:19.679 region:rollup2
BECOMING HOMELESS RIGHT. IT IN

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:20.747 region:rollup2
THIS MARKET RIGHT NOW SO MAYBE

01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:22.749 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PROGRAM THAT COULD BE

01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:24.751 region:rollup2
FUNDED BUT IT'S STILL NOT GOING

01:55:22.749 --> 01:55:26.219 region:rollup2
TO CURE THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

01:55:24.751 --> 01:55:28.255 region:rollup2
THE NEEDY OF THE NEEDY BUT MAYBE

01:55:26.219 --> 01:55:30.023 region:rollup2
IT STOP SO. WE DID THE POINT A

01:55:28.255 --> 01:55:31.792 region:rollup2
TIME COUNT IN ORANGE COUNTY WE

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:33.994 region:rollup2
HAD. COME UP WITH AROUND FIVE

01:55:31.792 --> 01:55:35.796 region:rollup2
THOUSAND HALF OF THOSE FOLKS

01:55:33.994 --> 01:55:36.363 region:rollup2
WERE FOLKS THAT WERE HOMELESS

01:55:35.796 --> 01:55:39.366 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY RECENTLY LOST A

01:55:36.363 --> 01:55:41.535 region:rollup2
JOB.

01:55:39.366 --> 01:55:43.036 region:rollup2
THEY HAD A FAMILY TRAGEDY EVENT

01:55:41.535 --> 01:55:45.038 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY GOT SICK OR THERE WAS

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:46.540 region:rollup2
ON A MARRIAGE THAT SPLIT UP SO

01:55:45.038 --> 01:55:49.075 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WAS HOMELESS. THOSE ARE

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:50.510 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT SHOULD BE HOUSED

01:55:49.075 --> 01:55:52.646 region:rollup2
IN POTENTIALLY LIKE IT OUR

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:54.748 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL TAX CREDIT PROJECT

01:55:52.646 --> 01:55:56.650 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT THE MOST DIFFICULT

01:55:54.748 --> 01:55:58.218 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SO THEN THEN YOU ARE LEFT

01:55:56.650 --> 01:56:00.387 region:rollup2
WITH THE OTHER HALF. THAT ARE

01:55:58.218 --> 01:56:02.556 region:rollup2
GONNA BE YEAR MORE INTENSE

01:56:00.387 --> 01:56:03.290 region:rollup2
THAT. AGAIN NEED THE PERMANENT

PROGRAMS TO COVER THOSE

01:56:15.969 --> 01:56:19.272 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:56:17.838 --> 01:56:20.340 region:rollup2

02:02:43.456 --> 02:02:47.694 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION.

02:02:45.725 --> 02:02:49.462 region:rollup2
IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:02:47.694 --> 02:02:51.164 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION AS A

02:02:49.462 --> 02:02:53.132 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THE TAX BILL.

02:02:51.164 --> 02:02:54.767 region:rollup2
I THIS IS PRIMARILY.

02:02:53.132 --> 02:02:58.605 region:rollup2
A FUNCTION OF THE DECREASE IN

02:02:54.767 --> 02:02:59.539 region:rollup2

ONE PERCENT.

02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:08.281 region:rollup2
WILL REDUCE THE TAX LOSS.

02:03:06.312 --> 02:03:10.783 region:rollup2
BENEFITS

02:03:08.281 --> 02:03:11.851 region:rollup2

02:03:10.783 --> 02:03:13.553 region:rollup2
SINCE THE VALUE OF THE

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:15.788 region:rollup2
DEPRECIATION EXPENSE DEDUCTIONS.

02:03:13.553 --> 02:03:17.590 region:rollup2
WILL BE REDUCED.

02:03:15.788 --> 02:03:20.260 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THE CHANGE IN THE TAX

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:22.228 region:rollup2
RATE DOES NOT AFFECT THE VALUE

02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:23.596 region:rollup2
OF THE TAX CREDITS THEMSELVES.

02:03:22.228 --> 02:03:24.097 region:rollup2
THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT ARE

02:03:23.596 --> 02:03:26.299 region:rollup2
BUILT INTO THE INVESTORS

02:03:24.097 --> 02:03:29.002 region:rollup2
PRICING.

02:03:26.299 --> 02:03:31.704 region:rollup2
ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED.

02:03:29.002 --> 02:03:33.006 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE CONDUCTING A STUDY.

02:03:31.704 --> 02:03:35.608 region:rollup2
THAT SUGGESTED JUST THE MERE

02:03:33.006 --> 02:03:37.543 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATION OF TAX REFORM

02:03:35.608 --> 02:03:39.279 region:rollup2
DURING TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

02:03:37.543 --> 02:03:42.815 region:rollup2
HOW REDUCED AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:03:39.279 --> 02:03:44.350 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION BY ELEVEN PERCENT?

02:03:42.815 --> 02:03:46.786 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOLLOWING

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:48.388 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION.

02:03:46.786 --> 02:03:50.323 region:rollup2
THIS ESTIMATED ELEVEN PERCENT

02:03:48.388 --> 02:03:52.926 region:rollup2
DECREASE.

02:03:50.323 --> 02:03:53.927 region:rollup2
IS BASED ON A REDUCTION.

02:03:52.926 --> 02:03:55.795 region:rollup2
PROJECTED REDUCTION OF THE

02:03:53.927 --> 02:03:57.797 region:rollup2
CORPORATE TAX RATE.

02:03:55.795 --> 02:03:59.532 region:rollup2
FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT.

02:03:57.797 --> 02:04:01.134 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.

02:03:59.532 --> 02:04:03.269 region:rollup2
WITH TWENTY FIVE PERCENT BEING

02:04:01.134 --> 02:04:05.438 region:rollup2
THE. WIDELY ADOPTED UNDERWRITING

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:07.006 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION THAT WAS USED DURING

02:04:05.438 --> 02:04:10.376 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:11.811 region:rollup2
IN ANTICIPATION OF TAX REFORM.

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:13.279 region:rollup2
SO NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THE

02:04:11.811 --> 02:04:15.248 region:rollup2
ENACTED TAX RATE IS TWENTY ONE

02:04:13.279 --> 02:04:16.749 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:04:15.248 --> 02:04:18.685 region:rollup2
WE'RE ESTIMATING AN ADDITIONAL

02:04:16.749 --> 02:04:20.186 region:rollup2
DECLINE OF ABOUT THREE PERCENT

02:04:18.685 --> 02:04:21.988 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE AGGREGATE DECLINE.

02:04:20.186 --> 02:04:23.256 region:rollup2
OF AFFORDABLE.

02:04:21.988 --> 02:04:25.058 region:rollup2
HOUSING PRODUCTION PER DOLLAR OF

02:04:23.256 --> 02:04:26.426 region:rollup2
CREDITS.

02:04:25.058 --> 02:04:27.493 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REDUCTION OF

02:04:26.426 --> 02:04:28.695 region:rollup2
THE CORPORATE TAX RATE IS

02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:35.435 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED TO BE AROUND

02:04:28.695 --> 02:04:37.236 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN PERCENT.

02:04:35.435 --> 02:04:38.571 region:rollup2
I'M SO WE WE'VE ESTIMATED.

02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:41.374 region:rollup2
THE TAX BILL WILL REDUCE THE

02:04:38.571 --> 02:04:42.875 region:rollup2
FUTURE SUPPLY OF RENTAL HOUSING.

02:04:41.374 --> 02:04:44.377 region:rollup2
I BY NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:46.612 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES

02:04:44.377 --> 02:04:48.481 region:rollup2
NATIONWIDE OVER TEN YEARS.

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:50.249 region:rollup2
.

02:04:48.481 --> 02:04:51.451 region:rollup2
WHETHER A FEW COMPONENTS OF THE

02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:52.752 region:rollup2
TAX BILL THAT FACTOR INTO THIS

02:04:51.451 --> 02:04:54.320 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE.

02:04:52.752 --> 02:04:56.522 region:rollup2
THE REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:57.056 region:rollup2
TAX RATE IS BY FAR THE MOST

02:04:56.522 --> 02:04:58.725 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THIS

02:04:57.056 --> 02:05:01.260 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE.

02:04:58.725 --> 02:05:01.828 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTING FOR ALMOST.

02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:03.029 region:rollup2
NINETY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL

02:05:01.828 --> 02:05:04.897 region:rollup2
REDUCTION.

02:05:03.029 --> 02:05:07.200 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:08.001 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AND

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:10.003 region:rollup2
HOUSING PRODUCTION WOULD ALSO

02:05:08.001 --> 02:05:11.471 region:rollup2
MEAN. A LOSS OF MORE THAN TWO

02:05:10.003 --> 02:05:13.773 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND.

02:05:11.471 --> 02:05:14.774 region:rollup2
JOBS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

02:05:13.773 --> 02:05:16.943 region:rollup2
BUSINESS INCOME IN FEDERAL AND

02:05:14.774 --> 02:05:18.745 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:05:16.943 --> 02:05:21.614 region:rollup2
TAX REVENUE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

02:05:18.745 --> 02:05:24.016 region:rollup2
.

02:05:21.614 --> 02:05:26.219 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO ESTIMATED.

02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:28.888 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT ON EACH STATE.

02:05:26.219 --> 02:05:30.857 region:rollup2
AND AS AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT.

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:32.358 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS.

02:05:30.857 --> 02:05:33.693 region:rollup2
GOODNESS IS EXPECTED TO SUFFER

02:05:32.358 --> 02:05:36.262 region:rollup2
THE GREATEST LOSSES.

02:05:33.693 --> 02:05:37.597 region:rollup2
BY A WIDE MARGIN.

02:05:36.262 --> 02:05:38.998 region:rollup2
I WE'VE ESTIMATED THAT OUT OF

02:05:37.597 --> 02:05:40.533 region:rollup2
THAT NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:41.501 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES.

02:05:40.533 --> 02:05:43.636 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE LOST OVER THE NEXT

02:05:41.501 --> 02:05:44.971 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS.

02:05:43.636 --> 02:05:47.807 region:rollup2
ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND OF THESE

02:05:44.971 --> 02:05:49.842 region:rollup2
HOMES WOULD BE CALIFORNIA HOMES.

02:05:47.807 --> 02:05:51.811 region:rollup2
I THEN THIS IS NEARLY TWICE THE

02:05:49.842 --> 02:05:53.479 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF HOMES.

02:05:51.811 --> 02:05:55.481 region:rollup2
FOR THAT THE NEXT STATE ON THE

02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:57.283 region:rollup2
LIST.

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:58.284 region:rollup2
SO.

02:05:57.283 --> 02:05:59.786 region:rollup2
I WAS GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:05:58.284 --> 02:06:02.088 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE STATE CREDITS IN THE

02:05:59.786 --> 02:06:03.956 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF THE STATE CREDITS.

02:06:02.088 --> 02:06:06.826 region:rollup2
FROM AS A RESULT OF TAX REFORM.

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:08.661 region:rollup2
SO WITH REGARDS TO STAY CREDITS.

02:06:06.826 --> 02:06:10.663 region:rollup2
HI IN GENERAL FUND THE NON

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:12.265 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATED STATE CREDITS

02:06:10.663 --> 02:06:14.400 region:rollup2
ARE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH

02:06:12.265 --> 02:06:15.735 region:rollup2
THIS FEDERAL TAX RATE.

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:17.270 region:rollup2
THERE'S KIND OF AN INVERSE

02:06:15.735 --> 02:06:19.005 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP.

02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:21.240 region:rollup2
SUCH THAT WHEN THE FEDERAL TAX

02:06:19.005 --> 02:06:23.409 region:rollup2
RATE WAS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT.

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:24.877 region:rollup2
THE STATE CREDIT PRICES.

02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:27.046 region:rollup2
WE'RE GENERALLY IN THE IN THE

02:06:24.877 --> 02:06:28.648 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE CENT RANGE.

02:06:27.046 --> 02:06:29.515 region:rollup2
SO NOW THAT THE FEDERAL TAX RATE

02:06:28.648 --> 02:06:31.150 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN REDUCED TO TWENTY ONE

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:32.718 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:34.120 region:rollup2
WE EXPECT A SEE AN INCREASE IN

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:35.721 region:rollup2
THE NON CERTIFICATED CREDIT

02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:38.624 region:rollup2
PRICING.

02:06:35.721 --> 02:06:40.460 region:rollup2
OF ROUGHLY TWENTY PERCENT.

02:06:38.624 --> 02:06:42.095 region:rollup2
NOW CALIFORNIA'S CERTIFICATED

02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:43.663 region:rollup2
CREDIT PROGRAM. PROVIDES A

02:06:42.095 --> 02:06:44.997 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF BENEFITS

02:06:43.663 --> 02:06:46.466 region:rollup2
INCLUDING A MECHANISM THAT

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:48.534 region:rollup2
SEVERS THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN

02:06:46.466 --> 02:06:50.069 region:rollup2
THE CREDIT PRICES. AND FEDERAL

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:51.704 region:rollup2
TAX RATES THAT CAN.

02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:53.306 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE CREDIT

02:06:51.704 --> 02:06:53.806 region:rollup2
PRICES FOR THE DEVELOPERS THAT

02:06:53.306 --> 02:06:56.075 region:rollup2
ELECT THEIR CERTIFICATED

02:06:53.806 --> 02:06:57.243 region:rollup2
CREDITS.

02:06:56.075 --> 02:06:58.578 region:rollup2
I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE

02:06:57.243 --> 02:07:00.012 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATED CREDIT SHOULD STILL

02:06:58.578 --> 02:07:01.681 region:rollup2
PRICE HIGHER THAN THE NON

02:07:00.012 --> 02:07:03.649 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATED CREDITS.

02:07:01.681 --> 02:07:05.885 region:rollup2
BUT AS A RESULT OF TAX REFORM.

02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:07.620 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:07:05.885 --> 02:07:10.056 region:rollup2
PRICING DIFFERENTIAL WILL

02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:12.258 region:rollup2
PROBABLY SHRINK A LITTLE BIT.

02:07:10.056 --> 02:07:14.927 region:rollup2
.

02:07:12.258 --> 02:07:17.196 region:rollup2
SO.

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:18.898 region:rollup2
S..

02:07:17.196 --> 02:07:19.432 region:rollup2
AS MANY OF U. KNOW HOW THE

02:07:18.898 --> 02:07:21.567 region:rollup2
HOUSING CREDIT IS WIDELY

02:07:19.432 --> 02:07:23.536 region:rollup2
REGARDED. AS ONE OF THE NATION'S

02:07:21.567 --> 02:07:25.471 region:rollup2
MOST SUCCESSFUL TOOLS FOR

02:07:23.536 --> 02:07:27.240 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING PRIVATE INVESTMENT.

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:28.307 region:rollup2
IN AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING.

02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:29.275 region:rollup2
FINANCING OVER THREE MILLION

THROUGH TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND

02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:36.082 region:rollup2
OVER TEN PERCENT OF THOSE HOMES

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:37.750 region:rollup2
ARE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:07:36.082 --> 02:07:39.051 region:rollup2
DIMINISHING ITS EFFECTIVENESS

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:39.919 region:rollup2
WILL INVARIABLY PUT PRESSURE ON

02:07:39.051 --> 02:07:41.320 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMS AND FUNDING

02:07:39.919 --> 02:07:43.289 region:rollup2

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:44.857 region:rollup2
SO IT'S ENCOURAGING TO SEE ALL

02:07:43.289 --> 02:07:46.659 region:rollup2
THE NEW FUNDING SOURCES COMING

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:48.861 region:rollup2

02:07:55.201 --> 02:07:57.670 region:rollup2
SUCH EFFORTS HAVE BEEN UNDER

02:07:56.536 --> 02:07:59.338 region:rollup2
WAY SINCE BEFORE THE TWENTY

02:07:57.670 --> 02:08:00.706 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN ELECTION.

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:01.274 region:rollup2

02:08:08.414 --> 02:08:12.952 region:rollup2
EARLIER THIS MONTH THERE WASN'T

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:13.786 region:rollup2
A SERIOUS EFFORT. TO INCLUDE

EFFORTS FELL SHORT.

02:08:21.794 --> 02:08:24.430 region:rollup2

ENCOURAGING SIGN.

02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:27.300 region:rollup2

LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE.

02:08:56.329 --> 02:08:58.531 region:rollup2
THE CONGRESS COULD CONSIDER THIS

LIKELY BE A SPENDING BILL.

02:09:02.068 --> 02:09:05.571 region:rollup2
SLATED FOR BEFORE MARCH TWENTY

02:09:03.769 --> 02:09:07.540 region:rollup2
THIRD.

02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:09.041 region:rollup2
I THINK.

02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:09.508 region:rollup2
I OUT I JUST WANNA POINT OUT

02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:11.577 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THE MOST

02:09:09.508 --> 02:09:13.079 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF THIS CAN'T

02:09:11.577 --> 02:09:14.914 region:rollup2
WELL HATCH BILL.

02:09:13.079 --> 02:09:17.350 region:rollup2
IS THAT. IS THE FIFTY PERCENT

02:09:14.914 --> 02:09:19.418 region:rollup2
INCREASE AN ANNUAL AUTHORITY FOR

02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:20.486 region:rollup2
HOUSING CREDITS.

02:09:19.418 --> 02:09:22.054 region:rollup2
AND INCREASING THE PER CAPITA

02:09:20.486 --> 02:09:23.789 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION AMOUNT WILL HELP

02:09:22.054 --> 02:09:25.825 region:rollup2
MITIGATE THE LOSSES

02:09:23.789 --> 02:09:27.493 region:rollup2
RESULTING FROM TAX REFORM.

02:09:25.825 --> 02:09:28.628 region:rollup2
HOW WE ESTIMATE THAT THE FIFTY

02:09:27.493 --> 02:09:30.663 region:rollup2
PERCENT INCREASE

02:09:28.628 --> 02:09:31.664 region:rollup2
COULD ADD?

02:09:30.663 --> 02:09:33.499 region:rollup2
OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:09:31.664 --> 02:09:37.570 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS.

02:09:33.499 --> 02:09:39.005 region:rollup2
NATIONWIDE OVER TEN YEARS.

02:09:37.570 --> 02:09:40.573 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE

02:09:39.005 --> 02:09:42.074 region:rollup2
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY LA

02:09:40.573 --> 02:09:43.643 region:rollup2
AND RECENTLY RELEASED THEIR

02:09:42.074 --> 02:09:45.211 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN

02:09:43.643 --> 02:09:46.779 region:rollup2
BUDGET REQUESTS.

02:09:45.211 --> 02:09:48.047 region:rollup2
AS ANTICIPATED IT'S NOT GOOD

02:09:46.779 --> 02:09:48.781 region:rollup2
NEWS FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:09:48.047 --> 02:09:50.316 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY OR COMMUNITY

02:09:48.781 --> 02:09:51.717 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

02:09:50.316 --> 02:09:52.752 region:rollup2
HOW THE PLAN SEEKS TO CUT HIDE

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:54.854 region:rollup2
FUNDING BY ALMOST FIFTEEN

02:09:52.752 --> 02:09:55.688 region:rollup2
PERCENT?

02:09:54.854 --> 02:09:57.156 region:rollup2
WITH CUTS TO A VARIETY OF OTHER

02:09:55.688 --> 02:09:58.524 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:09:57.156 --> 02:10:00.760 region:rollup2
AND A PROPOSED ELIMINATION OF CD

02:09:58.524 --> 02:10:02.628 region:rollup2
BG AND HOME.

02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:04.330 region:rollup2
FOR A NUMBER OF REASON.

02:10:02.628 --> 02:10:06.766 region:rollup2
THE THIS BUDGET ISN'T UNLIKELY

02:10:04.330 --> 02:10:08.901 region:rollup2
TO ADVANCE.

02:10:06.766 --> 02:10:10.302 region:rollup2
INSTEAD CONGRESS WILL NOW FOCUS

02:10:08.901 --> 02:10:12.071 region:rollup2
ON COMPLETING THE FISCAL YEAR

02:10:10.302 --> 02:10:13.773 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN APPROPRIATIONS

02:10:12.071 --> 02:10:15.174 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:10:13.773 --> 02:10:16.676 region:rollup2
WITH THE GOAL OF AN ACTING AN

02:10:15.174 --> 02:10:17.877 region:rollup2
OMNIBUS BILL.

02:10:16.676 --> 02:10:19.178 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION

02:10:17.877 --> 02:10:20.346 region:rollup2
FUNDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:10:19.178 --> 02:10:27.219 region:rollup2
EXPIRES.

02:10:20.346 --> 02:10:30.056 region:rollup2
ON MARCH TWENTY THIRD.

02:10:27.219 --> 02:10:32.725 region:rollup2
CENTER HELD. YOU KNOW I'M.

02:10:30.056 --> 02:10:34.794 region:rollup2
I WAS SO FOCUSED ON AND THE SALT

02:10:32.725 --> 02:10:36.562 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND THE MORTGAGE DEDUCTION

02:10:34.794 --> 02:10:38.431 region:rollup2
ISSUE ASSOCIATE WITH A TAX PLAN

02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:39.932 region:rollup2
THAT I CONFESS I'M.

02:10:38.431 --> 02:10:42.601 region:rollup2
A LITTLE HAZY ABOUT.

02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:43.836 region:rollup2
THIS AREA OF THE TAX PLAN AND I

02:10:42.601 --> 02:10:45.838 region:rollup2
WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU JUST GAVE A

02:10:43.836 --> 02:10:46.939 region:rollup2
LAYMAN'S.

02:10:45.838 --> 02:10:49.008 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTION OF HOW.

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:50.943 region:rollup2
THE.

02:10:49.008 --> 02:10:52.978 region:rollup2
TAX CREDIT USED TO WORK AND HOW

02:10:50.943 --> 02:10:55.614 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN CHANGED BY THE FEDERAL

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:57.750 region:rollup2
TAX PLAN.

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:59.952 region:rollup2
SO THE TAX CREDIT ITSELF WAS NOT

02:10:57.750 --> 02:11:01.754 region:rollup2
CHANGED IT WAS LEFT IN THE CODE

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:03.589 region:rollup2
THE SAME CODE SECTION NO CHANGES

02:11:01.754 --> 02:11:05.691 region:rollup2
TO THAT CODE SECTION.

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:07.259 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COUNTERPART SO THERE'S

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:08.861 region:rollup2
TWO NOTICED TWO CREDITS THERE'S

02:11:07.259 --> 02:11:10.329 region:rollup2
A NINE PERCENT CREDIT. AND A

02:11:08.861 --> 02:11:12.098 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT CREDIT FOR PERCENT

02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:13.799 region:rollup2
CREDIT IS ALWAYS PAIRED WITH

02:11:12.098 --> 02:11:15.368 region:rollup2
PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS.

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:16.802 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS WERE

02:11:15.368 --> 02:11:18.437 region:rollup2
WERE VERY CLOSE TO BEING

02:11:16.802 --> 02:11:19.305 region:rollup2
ELIMINATED THROUGH TAX REFORM

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:21.340 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ENDED UP.

02:11:19.305 --> 02:11:23.709 region:rollup2
STAYING IN.

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:25.244 region:rollup2
IN THE TAX CODE AS WELL SO TAX

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:27.213 region:rollup2
CREDITS PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS

02:11:25.244 --> 02:11:28.414 region:rollup2
STATE IN THE CODE.

02:11:27.213 --> 02:11:29.648 region:rollup2
AT THE BIGGEST IMPACT THOUGH IS

02:11:28.414 --> 02:11:31.016 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:11:29.648 --> 02:11:32.585 region:rollup2
THE TAX RATES THE FOR THE

02:11:31.016 --> 02:11:33.352 region:rollup2
CORPORATE TAX RATE GOING FROM

02:11:32.585 --> 02:11:34.987 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:36.555 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT.

02:11:34.987 --> 02:11:38.190 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:40.092 region:rollup2
INVESTORS WERE TURNED ON THEIR

02:11:38.190 --> 02:11:40.993 region:rollup2
TAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS

02:11:40.092 --> 02:11:42.995 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT THERE WILL BE

02:11:40.993 --> 02:11:43.629 region:rollup2
LESS EQUITY SO I HAVE HAD A

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:43.896 region:rollup2
CHART HERE THAT SHOW THAT THERE

02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:48.400 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

02:11:43.896 --> 02:11:49.502 region:rollup2
THE VALUE.

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:50.836 region:rollup2
A HEARD THE PRICES ARE PRESENT

02:11:49.502 --> 02:11:52.338 region:rollup2
PRICES THAT INVESTORS ARE

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:53.339 region:rollup2
WILLING TO PAY FOR THE RIGHTS

02:11:52.338 --> 02:11:54.106 region:rollup2
HAS ROBBED.

02:11:53.339 --> 02:11:55.608 region:rollup2
EXACTLY BY. ROUGHLY FIFTEEN

02:11:54.106 --> 02:11:57.943 region:rollup2
PERCENT

02:11:55.608 --> 02:11:59.378 region:rollup2
SO EVERY TAX CREDIT

02:11:57.943 --> 02:12:00.746 region:rollup2
DEFAULT THE IT IS FURTHER

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:02.014 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT

02:12:00.746 --> 02:12:03.816 region:rollup2
BUT I'M SEEING IT.

02:12:02.014 --> 02:12:04.750 region:rollup2
DID YOU THE SAME LOGIC APPLIES

02:12:03.816 --> 02:12:05.951 region:rollup2
TO NEARLY EVERY TAX CREDIT IN

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:06.986 region:rollup2
THE CODE.

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:08.687 region:rollup2
THAT CORPORATIONS ARE TAKING

02:12:06.986 --> 02:12:10.523 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF.

02:12:08.687 --> 02:12:11.157 region:rollup2
NO NO I THINK EACH ONE OF US IS

02:12:10.523 --> 02:12:13.025 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE ITS OWN DYNAMICS.

02:12:11.157 --> 02:12:14.794 region:rollup2
.

02:12:13.025 --> 02:12:16.162 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ONE

02:12:14.794 --> 02:12:17.730 region:rollup2
IN THAT SENSE VERSES ANOTHER TAX

02:12:16.162 --> 02:12:19.598 region:rollup2
CREDIT.

02:12:17.730 --> 02:12:21.834 region:rollup2
VERSUS LIKE SAY THAT THE NEW

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:24.403 region:rollup2
MARKETS TAX CREDIT OR. OR ANY

02:12:21.834 --> 02:12:26.138 region:rollup2
OTHER TIME SOME MANY NOT ME NINE

02:12:24.403 --> 02:12:30.843 region:rollup2
HOUSING REALLY TAX CREDIT.

02:12:26.138 --> 02:12:31.644 region:rollup2
MOON.

02:12:30.843 --> 02:12:33.279 region:rollup2
SO I GET LIKE FOR EXAMPLE.

02:12:31.644 --> 02:12:35.014 region:rollup2
.

02:12:33.279 --> 02:12:36.682 region:rollup2
THE NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT.

02:12:35.014 --> 02:12:37.316 region:rollup2
SERVER SOME ARE INDEED TAX

02:12:36.682 --> 02:12:38.417 region:rollup2
CREDIT OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE

02:12:37.316 --> 02:12:40.119 region:rollup2
LINES

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:41.921 region:rollup2
OKAY. SO I MEET EACH ONE OF

02:12:40.119 --> 02:12:43.589 region:rollup2
THOSE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS

02:12:41.921 --> 02:12:44.123 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX

02:12:43.589 --> 02:12:45.157 region:rollup2
CREDITS TO CHART THAT I'M

02:12:44.123 --> 02:12:45.724 region:rollup2
SHOWING HERE.

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:46.926 region:rollup2
IT'S SHOWING THAT THE CREDIT

02:12:45.724 --> 02:12:48.127 region:rollup2
PRICES.

02:12:46.926 --> 02:12:49.361 region:rollup2
ARE MORE THAN A DOLLAR PER

02:12:48.127 --> 02:12:50.629 region:rollup2
CREDIT THAT'S A CREDIT THAT'S

02:12:49.361 --> 02:12:52.565 region:rollup2
BEING.

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:53.566 region:rollup2
EARNED BY THAT INVESTOR OVER TEN

02:12:52.565 --> 02:12:55.100 region:rollup2
YEAR PERIOD RECENT THEY'RE

02:12:53.566 --> 02:12:56.335 region:rollup2
PAYING MORE THAN THAT DOLLARS

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.803 region:rollup2
FOR THE CREDIT NOW. IS A

02:12:56.335 --> 02:12:59.205 region:rollup2
BEGINNING ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AS

02:12:57.803 --> 02:13:00.973 region:rollup2
A RESULT OF THEIR INVESTMENT.

02:12:59.205 --> 02:13:02.241 region:rollup2
IN THE PRIMARY.

02:13:00.973 --> 02:13:04.009 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL BENEFIT THAT THESE

02:13:02.241 --> 02:13:06.378 region:rollup2
INVESTORS ARE GETTING.

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:08.447 region:rollup2
S. I IS TAX LOSSES FROM THE

02:13:06.378 --> 02:13:11.083 region:rollup2
DEPRECIATION OF THE BUILDING.

02:13:08.447 --> 02:13:13.052 region:rollup2
AND THOSE TAX LOSSES.

02:13:11.083 --> 02:13:14.353 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOWER VALUE AS A RESULT

02:13:13.052 --> 02:13:17.256 region:rollup2
OF THAT THE CORPORATE TAX RATE

02:13:14.353 --> 02:13:18.424 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW OTHER TAX CREDITS.

02:13:17.256 --> 02:13:19.625 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE DIFFERENT PRICING

02:13:18.424 --> 02:13:21.393 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS BECAUSE ARE BEING

02:13:19.625 --> 02:13:23.062 region:rollup2
AWARDED TO THE INVESTORS OVER

02:13:21.393 --> 02:13:24.330 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S

02:13:23.062 --> 02:13:26.398 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY HARD TO CORRELATE THE

02:13:24.330 --> 02:13:28.400 region:rollup2
TWO. SWAT WHERE IS THIS GONNA DO

02:13:26.398 --> 02:13:29.435 region:rollup2
IT WOULD SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:30.636 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

02:13:29.435 --> 02:13:31.604 region:rollup2
WELL THIS IS ACTUALLY SHOWING

02:13:30.636 --> 02:13:33.005 region:rollup2
SHOWS A STEEP DROP RIGHT AFTER

02:13:31.604 --> 02:13:34.406 region:rollup2
THE ELECTION.

02:13:33.005 --> 02:13:36.375 region:rollup2
IN ANTICIPATION OF TAX REFORM

02:13:34.406 --> 02:13:38.377 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:40.913 region:rollup2
SO THAT ROB IS.

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:42.815 region:rollup2
GEN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:13:40.913 --> 02:13:44.483 region:rollup2
YEAH YEAH THERE WAS A SHARP DROP

02:13:42.815 --> 02:13:45.751 region:rollup2
BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION

02:13:44.483 --> 02:13:47.052 region:rollup2
EVERYONE STARTED TO REALIZE THAT

02:13:45.751 --> 02:13:48.687 region:rollup2
THERE IS A STRONG LIKELIHOOD

02:13:47.052 --> 02:13:50.489 region:rollup2
THAT TAX REFORM WOULD BE ENACTED

02:13:48.687 --> 02:13:53.058 region:rollup2
INTO WHERE IS IT. WHERE THE

02:13:50.489 --> 02:13:54.026 region:rollup2
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN

02:13:53.058 --> 02:13:55.728 region:rollup2
MEMBERS ARE WE NOT KNOW YET?

02:13:54.026 --> 02:13:57.530 region:rollup2
NO NO THIS IS KIND OF IT'S KIND

02:13:55.728 --> 02:13:59.398 region:rollup2
A THREE MONTH ROLLING AVERAGE SO

02:13:57.530 --> 02:14:01.667 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA YET. BUT

02:13:59.398 --> 02:14:02.234 region:rollup2
IS IT DROP FURTHER.

02:14:01.667 --> 02:14:07.406 region:rollup2
BICU I I THINK WE'RE KIND OF

02:14:02.234 --> 02:14:09.208 region:rollup2
SEEM TO

02:14:07.406 --> 02:14:09.842 region:rollup2
DROP RIGHT THERE IN DECEMBER. I

02:14:09.208 --> 02:14:11.010 region:rollup2
THINK I THINK YOU KNOW WE WOULD

02:14:09.842 --> 02:14:12.411 region:rollup2
LIKE US AND THEY WERE USING A

02:14:11.010 --> 02:14:14.246 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT RATE FOR

02:14:12.411 --> 02:14:16.315 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:14:14.246 --> 02:14:16.916 region:rollup2
NOW NOW IT'S GONE DOWN TO TWENTY

02:14:16.315 --> 02:14:18.250 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT.

02:14:16.916 --> 02:14:19.418 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT

02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:21.186 region:rollup2
DROPPED SORT OF AT THE END OF

02:14:19.418 --> 02:14:23.389 region:rollup2
THAT CHART THERE.

02:14:21.186 --> 02:14:26.025 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS SO THIS IS MONEY

02:14:23.389 --> 02:14:29.094 region:rollup2
THAT USED TO.

02:14:26.025 --> 02:14:30.029 region:rollup2
BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF.

02:14:29.094 --> 02:14:32.331 region:rollup2
OF LOW INCOME HOUSING

02:14:30.029 --> 02:14:34.667 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION.

02:14:32.331 --> 02:14:36.969 region:rollup2
CORRECT OKAY FOR CREATING THE

02:14:34.667 --> 02:14:38.337 region:rollup2
SUPPLY RIGHT.

02:14:36.969 --> 02:14:40.072 region:rollup2
OKAY THIS ISN'T FURTHER

02:14:38.337 --> 02:14:41.540 region:rollup2
EXACERBATING.

02:14:40.072 --> 02:14:42.841 region:rollup2
FACTOR THAT'S GOING TO MAKE

02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:45.511 region:rollup2
CORRECT AN ALREADY BAD SITUATION

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:46.645 region:rollup2
FOR HOURS.

02:14:45.511 --> 02:14:47.980 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS ALSO SO IT'S HARDLY

02:14:46.645 --> 02:14:48.647 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:49.815 region:rollup2
FIVE UNITS.

02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:52.384 region:rollup2
FEWER OVER TEN YEARS AS A RESULT

02:14:49.815 --> 02:14:56.789 region:rollup2
OF THE TAX BILL

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:57.523 region:rollup2
OKAY AND TO MY CLASSICAL HATCH.

02:14:56.789 --> 02:14:59.692 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS THAT THERE'S A

02:14:57.523 --> 02:15:00.392 region:rollup2
SENATE BILL CAN'T CAN'T WILL

02:14:59.692 --> 02:15:00.993 region:rollup2
HAVE TO THE SENATE BILL.

02:15:00.392 --> 02:15:02.227 region:rollup2
IN DC.

02:15:00.993 --> 02:15:04.263 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:05.597 region:rollup2
HAS A LONG LIST OF IMPROVEMENTS

02:15:04.263 --> 02:15:07.933 region:rollup2
TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX

02:15:05.597 --> 02:15:09.501 region:rollup2
CREDIT.

02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:11.203 region:rollup2
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH IS

02:15:09.501 --> 02:15:12.838 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THAT THE CREDITS ARE

02:15:11.203 --> 02:15:14.239 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED TO EACH STATE PER

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:15.708 region:rollup2
CAPITA A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:18.110 region:rollup2
TO DOLLARS AND.

02:15:15.708 --> 02:15:20.346 region:rollup2
I THIRTY FIVE CENTS PER PERSON

02:15:18.110 --> 02:15:21.847 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE. PRISON PROPOSED

02:15:20.346 --> 02:15:24.049 region:rollup2
ONE ONE OF THE SEVERAL

02:15:21.847 --> 02:15:25.818 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS. THAT'S INCLUDED IN

02:15:24.049 --> 02:15:29.088 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS INCREASING THAT

02:15:25.818 --> 02:15:31.390 region:rollup2
AMOUNT BY FIFTY PERCENT.

02:15:29.088 --> 02:15:35.294 region:rollup2
AND SO JUST THAT FIFTY PERCENT

02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:36.562 region:rollup2
INCREASE ALONE. COULD.

02:15:35.294 --> 02:15:37.730 region:rollup2
COULD COUNTERACT THE REDUCTION

02:15:36.562 --> 02:15:39.064 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW THAT TWO HUNDRED AND

02:15:37.730 --> 02:15:40.532 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TWO

02:15:39.064 --> 02:15:41.633 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE UNIT

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:43.268 region:rollup2
NATIONWIDE REDUCTION OVER TEN

02:15:41.633 --> 02:15:45.437 region:rollup2
YEARS. JUST A FIFTY PERCENT

02:15:43.268 --> 02:15:46.271 region:rollup2
INCREASE ALONE COULD BRING BACK

02:15:45.437 --> 02:15:48.340 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:15:46.271 --> 02:15:51.143 region:rollup2
UNITS OVER TEN YEARS NATIONWIDE

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:53.579 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE THAT BILL.

02:15:51.143 --> 02:15:55.914 region:rollup2
IS THAT YOU KNOW. THAT THE THAT

02:15:53.579 --> 02:15:56.448 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT CREDIT CENTER

02:15:55.914 --> 02:15:57.483 region:rollup2
PAIRED WITH THE TAX EXEMPT

02:15:56.448 --> 02:16:00.219 region:rollup2
BONDS.

02:15:57.483 --> 02:16:02.054 region:rollup2
WITH THE PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS.

02:16:00.219 --> 02:16:03.722 region:rollup2
THERE THIS BILL WOULD RIGHT NOW

02:16:02.054 --> 02:16:05.457 region:rollup2
THAT THAT CREDIT RATE SORT OF

02:16:03.722 --> 02:16:08.260 region:rollup2
FLOATS SUGGESTS EVERY MONTH IT'S

02:16:05.457 --> 02:16:09.895 region:rollup2
BEEN IN THE LOS THREES FOR YOU

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:11.664 region:rollup2
KNOW FOR A LONG TIME NOW. AYE

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:12.965 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD FIX THAT RATE OF

02:16:11.664 --> 02:16:14.733 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT.

02:16:12.965 --> 02:16:16.035 region:rollup2
JUST MOVING THAT CREDIT RATE

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:17.936 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MULTIPLY THAT YOU'RE

02:16:16.035 --> 02:16:18.470 region:rollup2
BUILDING BASIS BY TO CALCULATE

02:16:17.936 --> 02:16:20.172 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF CREDITS THE

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:22.107 region:rollup2
BUILDING EARNS. FOR CALCULATING

02:16:20.172 --> 02:16:23.842 region:rollup2
WITH THAT COULD ADD.

02:16:22.107 --> 02:16:25.010 region:rollup2
ANOTHER OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:27.046 region:rollup2
UNITS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS

02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:27.680 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:16:27.046 --> 02:16:28.947 region:rollup2
SO THIS BILL WAS THE STATUS THE

02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:31.350 region:rollup2
BILL NOW.

02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:33.852 region:rollup2
.

02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:34.453 region:rollup2
SO. IT WAS IT WAS CLOSE THERE

02:16:33.852 --> 02:16:35.554 region:rollup2
WAS A SERIES THERE'S A STRONG

02:16:34.453 --> 02:16:38.791 region:rollup2
PUSH.

02:16:35.554 --> 02:16:40.559 region:rollup2
THE THE TWO YEAR FEDERAL BUDGET

02:16:38.791 --> 02:16:42.561 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT THAT WAS ENACTED.

02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:44.096 region:rollup2
A TWO WEEKS AGO. THERE'S A VERY

02:16:42.561 --> 02:16:46.098 region:rollup2
STRONG PUSH TO INCLUDE SOME OF

02:16:44.096 --> 02:16:47.800 region:rollup2
THESE PROVISIONS IN THAT BILL.

02:16:46.098 --> 02:16:49.635 region:rollup2
SO CAME CLOSE.%

02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:50.736 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:16:49.635 --> 02:16:51.603 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE EFFORTS DID NOT

02:16:50.736 --> 02:16:53.539 region:rollup2
SUCCEED.

02:16:51.603 --> 02:16:55.174 region:rollup2
.

02:16:53.539 --> 02:16:56.709 region:rollup2
BUT IN A SOME PEOPLE IN DC ARE

02:16:55.174 --> 02:16:58.777 region:rollup2
WORKING VERY HARD.

02:16:56.709 --> 02:17:00.012 region:rollup2
I TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

02:16:58.777 --> 02:17:00.879 region:rollup2
BILL IS WELL POSITIONED.

02:17:00.012 --> 02:17:03.315 region:rollup2
TO.

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:05.017 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:17:03.315 --> 02:17:07.052 region:rollup2
B. ADDED TO ANY TAX LEGISLATIVE

02:17:05.017 --> 02:17:08.854 region:rollup2
VEHICLE THAT CONGRESS CONSIDERS

02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:09.088 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S

02:17:08.854 --> 02:17:10.322 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

02:17:09.088 --> 02:17:11.557 region:rollup2
.

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:13.759 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER SPENDING

02:17:11.557 --> 02:17:16.095 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION THAT'S DO YOU KNOW

02:17:13.759 --> 02:17:16.728 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR MONTH. SO

02:17:16.095 --> 02:17:17.830 region:rollup2
THERE THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THAT

02:17:16.728 --> 02:17:20.499 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE.

02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:20.799 region:rollup2
INCLUDED AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE I

02:17:20.499 --> 02:17:22.801 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

02:17:20.799 --> 02:17:23.635 region:rollup2
THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE EAGER

02:17:22.801 --> 02:17:24.203 region:rollup2
TO FIX

02:17:23.635 --> 02:17:25.037 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN GLITCH IN THE TAX

02:17:24.203 --> 02:17:27.072 region:rollup2
CODE.

02:17:25.037 --> 02:17:28.707 region:rollup2
.

02:17:27.072 --> 02:17:29.975 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THAT MIGHT YOU KNOW

02:17:28.707 --> 02:17:31.510 region:rollup2
OPEN THEM UP IN SOME OF THE

02:17:29.975 --> 02:17:32.778 region:rollup2
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVEN'T YET

02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:34.079 region:rollup2

SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:18.277 region:rollup2
AROUND THE THREE MAIN PROJECTS

02:20:16.608 --> 02:20:20.412 region:rollup2
AT THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE I'LL

02:20:18.277 --> 02:20:21.947 region:rollup2
BE SPEAKING TO YOU MOST TODAY IS

UNDERSTAND THE DRIVERS OF

02:20:24.149 --> 02:20:26.718 region:rollup2
DISPLACEMENT AND WORK WITH

02:20:26.051 --> 02:20:29.221 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO DESIGN EFFECTIVE

02:20:26.718 --> 02:20:30.389 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS.

02:20:29.221 --> 02:20:32.791 region:rollup2
SO I'M NOT GOING TO ON THE DATA

02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:34.593 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ALL KNOW VERY VERY WELL

02:20:32.791 --> 02:20:35.961 region:rollup2
BUT JUST REGARDING REGARDLESS TO

02:20:34.593 --> 02:20:37.896 region:rollup2
SAY THAT.

02:20:35.961 --> 02:20:39.398 region:rollup2
AT THE BUT THE.

02:20:37.896 --> 02:20:41.366 region:rollup2
BOTTOM ROW HERE SHOWS YOU THE

IF YOU'RE A TWO WORKER HOUSEHOLD

02:20:51.677 --> 02:20:54.513 region:rollup2
MAKING MINIMUM WAGE EACH OF YOU

02:20:53.445 --> 02:20:55.948 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE WORKING ELEVEN HOURS

02:20:54.513 --> 02:20:56.548 region:rollup2
A DAY.

02:20:55.948 --> 02:20:58.517 region:rollup2
TWO.

02:20:56.548 --> 02:21:02.387 region:rollup2
TO AFFORD RENT AND THAT TIME

H. CD THAT SHOWS THAT WHILE ALL

02:21:06.992 --> 02:21:10.095 region:rollup2
OF US OR FEELING THE CRUNCH OF

02:21:08.827 --> 02:21:11.930 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:21:10.095 --> 02:21:13.765 region:rollup2
TERRIBLE HOUSING CRISIS

02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:15.834 region:rollup2
UP IT'S REALLY OUR OUR LOW

02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:17.436 region:rollup2
INCOME AN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME

02:21:15.834 --> 02:21:19.104 region:rollup2
AS WE WERE HEARD ABOUT TODAY.

02:21:17.436 --> 02:21:20.605 region:rollup2
THAT ARE MOST SEVERELY BURDEN SO

02:21:19.104 --> 02:21:22.708 region:rollup2
HERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU

02:21:20.605 --> 02:21:24.142 region:rollup2
CAN SEE IN BLUE SEVERELY RENT

02:21:22.708 --> 02:21:26.211 region:rollup2
BURDENS THAT'S ME THAT'S

02:21:24.142 --> 02:21:28.313 region:rollup2
SPENDING MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT

02:21:26.211 --> 02:21:30.415 region:rollup2
OF YOUR INCOME ON RENT. A INNING

02:21:28.313 --> 02:21:32.184 region:rollup2
GREEN IS A RENT BURDEN THIS IS

02:21:30.415 --> 02:21:34.086 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OF YOUR INCOME ON

02:21:32.184 --> 02:21:36.288 region:rollup2
RENT AND AS YOU CAN SEE. THE

02:21:34.086 --> 02:21:37.823 region:rollup2
HIGHER YOUR INCOME THE LESS BIRD

02:21:36.288 --> 02:21:39.691 region:rollup2
AND YOU ARE TO.

02:21:37.823 --> 02:21:41.827 region:rollup2
THEN WHAT WE KNOW ALSO IS THAT

02:21:39.691 --> 02:21:43.795 region:rollup2
IF YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

02:21:41.827 --> 02:21:45.931 region:rollup2
ARE HOUSING COSTS ARE STATE

02:21:43.795 --> 02:21:48.200 region:rollup2
POVERTY LEVELS RATES JUMPED FROM

02:21:45.931 --> 02:21:50.035 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT.

02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:51.303 region:rollup2
UP WHICH IS CLEARLY CONTRIBUTING

02:21:50.035 --> 02:21:52.404 region:rollup2
TO THE FACT THAT NEARLY A

02:21:51.303 --> 02:21:55.974 region:rollup2
QUARTER OF OUR STATE'S CHILDREN

02:21:52.404 --> 02:21:57.709 region:rollup2
ARE GROWING UP IN POP.

02:21:55.974 --> 02:22:00.379 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS WHICH WE ALL KNOW

02:21:57.709 --> 02:22:02.247 region:rollup2
VERY WELL AS PART PERSONALLY I

02:22:00.379 --> 02:22:03.615 region:rollup2
CREATED BY THE UNDERSUPPLY. OF

02:22:02.247 --> 02:22:05.951 region:rollup2
OF HOUSING.

02:22:03.615 --> 02:22:07.185 region:rollup2
BUT ALL OF THIS IS CONTRIBUTING

02:22:05.951 --> 02:22:08.186 region:rollup2
TO MASK DISPLACEMENT I DON'T

02:22:07.185 --> 02:22:09.788 region:rollup2
KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN THE DATA

02:22:08.186 --> 02:22:11.556 region:rollup2
THAT CAME OUT TODAY FROM THE LA

02:22:09.788 --> 02:22:12.858 region:rollup2
O'BRIEN YOU LAWYERS ANALYSIS OF

02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:15.794 region:rollup2
IRS DATA.

02:22:12.858 --> 02:22:19.398 region:rollup2
BUT HE SHOWED IN THIS DATA SET.

02:22:15.794 --> 02:22:21.366 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE SEEING A MASS OUT

02:22:19.398 --> 02:22:24.102 region:rollup2
MIGRATION OF LOW AND MODERATE

02:22:21.366 --> 02:22:26.171 region:rollup2
INCOME RESIDENTS FROM CALIFORNIA

02:22:24.102 --> 02:22:27.806 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE. A AND THE ONLY

02:22:26.171 --> 02:22:28.974 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE

02:22:27.806 --> 02:22:29.474 region:rollup2
HERE ARE VERY HIGH INCOME AND

02:22:28.974 --> 02:22:31.343 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH

02:22:29.474 --> 02:22:32.611 region:rollup2
KITTY PEOPLE.

02:22:31.343 --> 02:22:34.346 region:rollup2
HERE'S SOME DATA FOR THE BAY

02:22:32.611 --> 02:22:37.082 region:rollup2
AREA WHICH I KNOW VERY WELL.

02:22:34.346 --> 02:22:38.150 region:rollup2
WITH WHICH WE CAN SEE HERE IS

02:22:37.082 --> 02:22:40.385 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE OF.

02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:40.886 region:rollup2
SOME HERE THAT CAME OUT FROM

02:22:40.385 --> 02:22:41.853 region:rollup2
READ FAN IN TWO THOUSAND

02:22:40.886 --> 02:22:43.221 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN.

02:22:41.853 --> 02:22:45.057 region:rollup2
THAT ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE LOOKING

02:22:43.221 --> 02:22:47.225 region:rollup2
FOR HOMES IN CALIFORNIA LOOKED

02:22:45.057 --> 02:22:48.660 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE.

02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:50.262 region:rollup2
A BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWO

02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:51.496 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE BAY AREA

02:22:50.262 --> 02:22:53.298 region:rollup2
LOST TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AFRICAN

02:22:51.496 --> 02:22:54.332 region:rollup2
AMERICAN RESIDENTS. AND THREE

02:22:53.298 --> 02:22:55.934 region:rollup2
QUARTERS OF THOSE WHO HAVE

02:22:54.332 --> 02:22:57.536 region:rollup2
LAUGHED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

02:22:55.934 --> 02:22:59.037 region:rollup2
MAKE LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND SO

02:22:57.536 --> 02:23:00.405 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPACTING US ALL BUT WE

02:22:59.037 --> 02:23:05.043 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S IMPACTING OUR MOST

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:08.113 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE THE MOST.

02:23:05.043 --> 02:23:09.181 region:rollup2
THE CASE IS A GOOD QUESTION SITE

02:23:08.113 --> 02:23:09.848 region:rollup2
THEN THE LAST SLIDE YEAH WHAT.

02:23:09.181 --> 02:23:11.550 region:rollup2
I MEAN WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF

02:23:09.848 --> 02:23:12.451 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION MAKES

02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:14.086 region:rollup2
LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:23:12.451 --> 02:23:15.353 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY.

02:23:14.086 --> 02:23:18.423 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER FOR YOU

02:23:15.353 --> 02:23:19.958 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW OKAY.

02:23:18.423 --> 02:23:21.359 region:rollup2
OKAY GUYS IF. I'M GONNA GET A

02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:22.394 region:rollup2
SENSE OF THAT'S.

02:23:21.359 --> 02:23:23.261 region:rollup2
CORRELATED WITH THE GENERAL

02:23:22.394 --> 02:23:26.465 region:rollup2
POPULATION OR IF IT'S

02:23:23.261 --> 02:23:28.867 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY BURDENED.

02:23:26.465 --> 02:23:30.102 region:rollup2
WAIT IF DEMOCRATIC EVALUATE THAT

02:23:28.867 --> 02:23:31.670 region:rollup2
THAT THE ASSERTION YOU'RE MAKING

02:23:30.102 --> 02:23:32.604 region:rollup2
AND. IN THAT SENSE IT'S I I

02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:34.005 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT THE MEANING OF

02:23:32.604 --> 02:23:36.842 region:rollup2
SENATE THIRTY EIGHT OUT WITH

02:23:34.005 --> 02:23:37.909 region:rollup2
FORTY THOUSAND.

02:23:36.842 --> 02:23:38.610 region:rollup2
NOW THAT I DON'T HAVE IT OFF THE

02:23:37.909 --> 02:23:40.779 region:rollup2
TOP OF MY HEAD.

02:23:38.610 --> 02:23:41.913 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT BE REPRESENTATIVE BUT

02:23:40.779 --> 02:23:43.949 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS JUST KIND OF

02:23:41.913 --> 02:23:51.423 region:rollup2
REFLECTIVE OF WHO'S MOVING OUT

02:23:43.949 --> 02:23:52.891 region:rollup2
IN HIS MOVING IN.

02:23:51.423 --> 02:23:54.693 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT GEOGRAPHY

02:23:52.891 --> 02:23:57.829 region:rollup2
WHICH WE THINK ABOUT A LOT.

02:23:54.693 --> 02:23:59.998 region:rollup2
AND AT THIS IS A MAP.

02:23:57.829 --> 02:24:01.700 region:rollup2
A COPY OF THE MAP THAT OF OUR

02:23:59.998 --> 02:24:03.268 region:rollup2
DISPLACEMENT RISK MAP WHICH

02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:04.970 region:rollup2
WE'VE JUST RECENTLY REALLY

02:24:03.268 --> 02:24:07.205 region:rollup2
EXPANDED OUT TO SACRAMENTO AND

02:24:04.970 --> 02:24:09.608 region:rollup2
DOWN TO SAN ACT SANTA CRUZ.

02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:11.142 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THIS

02:24:09.608 --> 02:24:12.844 region:rollup2
ARE DISTRIBUTION OF WHERE THIS

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:14.913 region:rollup2
IS OCCURRING WHERE THE RISK OF

02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:16.381 region:rollup2
DISPLACEMENT IS CURRYING. WE SEE

02:24:14.913 --> 02:24:18.149 region:rollup2
THAT OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF LOW

02:24:16.381 --> 02:24:19.784 region:rollup2
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE BAY

02:24:18.149 --> 02:24:21.786 region:rollup2
AREA ARE LIVING IN NEIGHBORHOODS

02:24:19.784 --> 02:24:23.288 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AT RISK OF OUR ALREADY

02:24:21.786 --> 02:24:25.457 region:rollup2
UNDERGOING DISPLACEMENT.

02:24:23.288 --> 02:24:26.324 region:rollup2
THAT'S ROUGHLY UP TEN PERCENT IN

02:24:25.457 --> 02:24:27.993 region:rollup2
THE LAST TWO YEARS SINCE OUR

02:24:26.324 --> 02:24:28.426 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS ANALYSIS SO WE KNOW

02:24:27.993 --> 02:24:32.797 region:rollup2
THAT THIS CRISIS IS

02:24:28.426 --> 02:24:34.733 region:rollup2
ACCELERATING.

02:24:32.797 --> 02:24:36.234 region:rollup2
AND AS WE HEARD EARLIER AND WE

02:24:34.733 --> 02:24:38.870 region:rollup2
KNOW PRETTY WELL AT THIS POINT

02:24:36.234 --> 02:24:40.539 region:rollup2
THE THE. DISPLACEMENT CRISIS HAS

02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:42.307 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON

02:24:40.539 --> 02:24:43.742 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WORKERS FAMILIES AND

02:24:42.307 --> 02:24:45.043 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:24:43.742 --> 02:24:46.411 region:rollup2
A THIS IS A RESEARCH BRIEF WE

02:24:45.043 --> 02:24:47.779 region:rollup2
CAME OUT WITH LAST YEAR FROM A

02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:49.948 region:rollup2
SURVEY WE DID OF ACTED

02:24:47.779 --> 02:24:51.650 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS INS FROM SAN MATEO

02:24:49.948 --> 02:24:53.685 region:rollup2
COUNTY. WE'RE NOT RIGHT NOW IN

02:24:51.650 --> 02:24:55.453 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF REPLICATING THE

02:24:53.685 --> 02:24:57.322 region:rollup2
SURVEY FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY.

02:24:55.453 --> 02:24:59.958 region:rollup2
ON IN WHAT WE FOUND A IN THIS

02:24:57.322 --> 02:25:00.825 region:rollup2
SURVEY IS THAT DISPLACEMENT IS

02:24:59.958 --> 02:25:02.060 region:rollup2
INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH OUR

02:25:00.825 --> 02:25:03.328 region:rollup2
HOUSING UP OUR HOMELESSNESS

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:04.663 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

02:25:03.328 --> 02:25:06.164 region:rollup2
WHEN IN THREE DISPLACE

02:25:04.663 --> 02:25:07.465 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS REPORTED SOME PERIOD

02:25:06.164 --> 02:25:09.067 region:rollup2
OF HOMELESSNESS OR MARTIAL

02:25:07.465 --> 02:25:10.402 region:rollup2
HOUSING IN THE TWO YEARS

02:25:09.067 --> 02:25:12.571 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THEIR AFFECTIONS ARE

02:25:10.402 --> 02:25:13.605 region:rollup2
DISPLACEMENT.

02:25:12.571 --> 02:25:16.041 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE

02:25:13.605 --> 02:25:17.909 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS THAT WERE DIS PLACE

02:25:16.041 --> 02:25:19.444 region:rollup2
LEFT THE COUNTY UP ALTHOUGH SO

02:25:17.909 --> 02:25:20.979 region:rollup2
THAT SAYING THAT THE MAJORITY

02:25:19.444 --> 02:25:22.647 region:rollup2
STAY IN THE COUNTY BECAUSE THEY

02:25:20.979 --> 02:25:23.915 region:rollup2
OFTEN ARE DOUBLING UP THERE ARE

02:25:22.647 --> 02:25:25.951 region:rollup2
LIVING IN SOME SORT OF MARGINAL

02:25:23.915 --> 02:25:28.019 region:rollup2
HOUSING WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS

02:25:25.951 --> 02:25:30.455 region:rollup2
OR. ON COUCHES.

02:25:28.019 --> 02:25:33.024 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE THAT LEFT UP LEFT THE

02:25:30.455 --> 02:25:34.159 region:rollup2
COUNTY ALTOGETHER ON IN THOSE

02:25:33.024 --> 02:25:36.027 region:rollup2
THAT WERE DISPLACED OUT OF THE

02:25:34.159 --> 02:25:37.596 region:rollup2
COUNTY AND. IN THE PAST MAJORITY

02:25:36.027 --> 02:25:39.631 region:rollup2
OF THEM ARE JUST PLACE TO WORSE

02:25:37.596 --> 02:25:40.899 region:rollup2
OFF NEIGHBORHOODS AND THIS IS

02:25:39.631 --> 02:25:42.701 region:rollup2
VALIDATING SOME RESEARCH THAT

02:25:40.899 --> 02:25:44.402 region:rollup2
CAME OUT OF PHILADELPHIA LAST

02:25:42.701 --> 02:25:45.770 region:rollup2
YEAR I BELIEVE. THAT SHOWED THAT

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:51.509 region:rollup2
DISPLAYS HOUSEHOLDS MOVED TO

02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:53.144 region:rollup2
LOWER LOWER OPPORTUNITY AREAS.

02:25:51.509 --> 02:25:54.179 region:rollup2
SO AS YOU ALL KNOW THERE'S NO

02:25:53.144 --> 02:25:56.114 region:rollup2
QUESTION WHERE THE SEVERE

02:25:54.179 --> 02:25:58.383 region:rollup2
HOUSING COURT SHORTAGE AND NEW

02:25:56.114 --> 02:26:00.085 region:rollup2
SUPPLIES CRITIC CRITICAL DUE TO

02:25:58.383 --> 02:26:01.519 region:rollup2
ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK AYE WE'VE

02:26:00.085 --> 02:26:03.421 region:rollup2
MADE AMAZING PROGRESS AT AND VIA

02:26:01.519 --> 02:26:04.723 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. ACCELERATING THE

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:06.224 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION OF HOUSING.

02:26:04.723 --> 02:26:07.659 region:rollup2
BUT THE QUESTION REALLY IS WHAT

02:26:06.224 --> 02:26:09.694 region:rollup2
ARE WE DOING TO PREVENT

02:26:07.659 --> 02:26:13.498 region:rollup2
DISPLACEMENT AND AND SLOW THE

02:26:09.694 --> 02:26:15.233 region:rollup2
TIED RIGHT NOW TODAY.

02:26:13.498 --> 02:26:16.568 region:rollup2
A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE DID WE PUT

02:26:15.233 --> 02:26:18.336 region:rollup2
OUT THIS RESEARCH BRIEF THAT

02:26:16.568 --> 02:26:19.437 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT MERCURY HOUSING

02:26:18.336 --> 02:26:21.373 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION.

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:24.242 region:rollup2
AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND ITS

02:26:21.373 --> 02:26:26.611 region:rollup2
IMPACTS ON HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

02:26:24.242 --> 02:26:28.280 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS A DISPLACEMENT RATES

02:26:26.611 --> 02:26:29.547 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT.

02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:30.849 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE PRODUCTION OF

02:26:29.547 --> 02:26:33.518 region:rollup2
MERCURY HOUSING IN THE NINETEEN

02:26:30.849 --> 02:26:35.987 region:rollup2
NINETIES LEAD TO LOWER MEDIAN

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:37.255 region:rollup2
RENTS IN FOR THE FIFTH FIFTEEN

02:26:35.987 --> 02:26:39.658 region:rollup2
YEARS LATER.

02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:41.192 region:rollup2
THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY LEVELS

02:26:39.658 --> 02:26:43.094 region:rollup2
THE HOUSING BURDEN FOR LOW

02:26:41.192 --> 02:26:45.196 region:rollup2
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS INCREASED IN

02:26:43.094 --> 02:26:46.364 region:rollup2
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS SO WHAT

02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:48.433 region:rollup2
BASICALLY WHAT THIS IS SAYING IS

02:26:46.364 --> 02:26:50.468 region:rollup2
THAT. YOU WHEN WE PRODUCE A FULL

02:26:48.433 --> 02:26:51.803 region:rollup2
MARKET RATE HOUSING IT IS NOT

02:26:50.468 --> 02:26:53.405 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE AFFORDABILITY

02:26:51.803 --> 02:26:55.140 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF LOW INCOME WRATH

02:26:53.405 --> 02:26:57.075 region:rollup2
TENANTS.

02:26:55.140 --> 02:26:58.877 region:rollup2
SO I THINK YOU KNOW BASICALLY

02:26:57.075 --> 02:27:00.578 region:rollup2
DRIVING HOME THIS THIS QUESTION

02:26:58.877 --> 02:27:02.213 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER BUILDING

02:27:00.578 --> 02:27:03.915 region:rollup2
MARKET RATE HOUSING IS NOT GONNA

02:27:02.213 --> 02:27:05.617 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE HOW THE HOUSING CRISIS

02:27:03.915 --> 02:27:07.485 region:rollup2
IN THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS FOR

02:27:05.617 --> 02:27:09.387 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WE NEED IT

02:27:07.485 --> 02:27:11.189 region:rollup2
NO QUESTION WE NEED IT. BUT IS

02:27:09.387 --> 02:27:13.525 region:rollup2
NOT THE SOLUTION FOR THE THAT

02:27:11.189 --> 02:27:16.161 region:rollup2
LOW END OF THE SCALE.

02:27:13.525 --> 02:27:17.662 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ALSO FOUND IS THAT

02:27:16.161 --> 02:27:19.664 region:rollup2
WHILE AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:21.666 region:rollup2
PRODUCING HOUSING ALTOGETHER FOR

02:27:19.664 --> 02:27:24.102 region:rollup2
BOTH SUBSIDIZE IN MARKET RATE A

02:27:21.666 --> 02:27:26.371 region:rollup2
REDUCE DISPLACEMENT PRESSURES?

02:27:24.102 --> 02:27:27.839 region:rollup2
EIGHT BIT THE PRODUCTION OF

02:27:26.371 --> 02:27:29.140 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:27:27.839 --> 02:27:33.378 region:rollup2
HAD TWICE THE IMPACT OF MARKET

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:36.414 region:rollup2
RATE HOUSING.

02:27:33.378 --> 02:27:37.582 region:rollup2
SO BY ALL MEANS AND WE ALL KNOW

02:27:36.414 --> 02:27:39.050 region:rollup2
AND YOU'LL KNOW VERY WELL WE

02:27:37.582 --> 02:27:40.819 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE PRODUCING MORE MARKET

02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:42.520 region:rollup2
RATE HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:27:40.819 --> 02:27:44.122 region:rollup2
JUST OUR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS

02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:45.223 region:rollup2
THAT LIVE IN THE STATE OR THAT

02:27:44.122 --> 02:27:47.726 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT.

02:27:45.223 --> 02:27:49.094 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE DO SO WE NEED TO ANY

02:27:47.726 --> 02:27:50.428 region:rollup2
FOR FOCUSED ON THAT WE NEED TO

02:27:49.094 --> 02:27:51.629 region:rollup2
BE MAKING SURE THAT WERE LINKING

02:27:50.428 --> 02:27:54.032 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION TO PRETTY

02:27:51.629 --> 02:27:55.800 region:rollup2
ACTIONS WHERE WHERE THE MARKET

02:27:54.032 --> 02:27:57.535 region:rollup2
WANTS TO PRODUCE NEW HOUSING. IS

02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:59.270 region:rollup2
WHERE RENTS ARE GROWING WHERE

02:27:57.535 --> 02:28:00.405 region:rollup2
THEY CAN MAKE PROFIT AND SO WE

02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:03.541 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE PROTECTING TENANTS IN

02:28:00.405 --> 02:28:03.541 region:rollup2
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WE CAN'T

02:28:03.608 --> 02:28:06.544 region:rollup2
DEVELOP MORE AND THAT'S GOING TO

02:28:05.176 --> 02:28:07.579 region:rollup2
HELP THE PEOPLE LIVING THERE NOW

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:08.813 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE

02:28:07.579 --> 02:28:10.281 region:rollup2
LIVING THERE NOW ARE NOT GONNA

02:28:08.813 --> 02:28:11.850 region:rollup2
BE HELPED BY THAT MARKET RATE

02:28:10.281 --> 02:28:12.684 region:rollup2
HOUSING SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:28:11.850 --> 02:28:13.918 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE HELPING THEM WHILE

02:28:12.684 --> 02:28:16.287 region:rollup2
ALSO PRODUCING MARKET RATE

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:17.122 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

02:28:16.287 --> 02:28:18.389 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE REQUIRED

02:28:17.122 --> 02:28:20.058 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY BUT OBVIOUSLY

02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:20.859 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HINDERING DEVELOPMENT

02:28:20.058 --> 02:28:22.594 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT WORK

02:28:20.859 --> 02:28:24.562 region:rollup2
I ALSO TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL

02:28:22.594 --> 02:28:26.798 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE IN THE CASA. GROUP

02:28:24.562 --> 02:28:27.365 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUP IN THE BAY AREA

02:28:26.798 --> 02:28:29.100 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF

02:28:27.365 --> 02:28:30.735 region:rollup2
GREAT WORK ON THIS AND HOW DO

02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:32.670 region:rollup2
YOU HOW DO YOU RATE SIZE

02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:34.539 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS OR

02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:35.807 region:rollup2
NOT KILLING TWO ALLOTMENT.

02:28:34.539 --> 02:28:38.042 region:rollup2
LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT AYE

02:28:35.807 --> 02:28:42.046 region:rollup2
YOU NOTE. REMOVING AFFORDABLE

02:28:38.042 --> 02:28:43.114 region:rollup2
UNITS FROM FROM A.

02:28:42.046 --> 02:28:44.549 region:rollup2
FROM OUR MARKET.

02:28:43.114 --> 02:28:46.918 region:rollup2
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

02:28:44.549 --> 02:28:48.753 region:rollup2
PRODUCING MARKET RATE UNITS.

02:28:46.918 --> 02:28:49.988 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT

02:28:48.753 --> 02:28:51.156 region:rollup2
WORK COMING OUT OF LOS ANGELES

02:28:49.988 --> 02:28:53.224 region:rollup2
ON NO NET LOSS POLICIES AND

02:28:51.156 --> 02:28:54.826 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE.

02:28:53.224 --> 02:28:56.161 region:rollup2
A AND THEN FINALLY I HOPE YOU

02:28:54.826 --> 02:28:57.362 region:rollup2
ARE FOR ON THIS TOPIC.

02:28:56.161 --> 02:28:58.863 region:rollup2
.

02:28:57.362 --> 02:29:00.498 region:rollup2
IF WE WANT TO BE CREATING

02:28:58.863 --> 02:29:01.800 region:rollup2
INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE

02:29:00.498 --> 02:29:03.101 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:04.636 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO BE PAYING

02:29:03.101 --> 02:29:07.105 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO LOCAL CONTEXTS IN

02:29:04.636 --> 02:29:08.606 region:rollup2
HIS PAST HISTORY TO BE ABLE TO A

02:29:07.105 --> 02:29:12.110 region:rollup2
HOT CREATE FAIR HOUSING IN OUR

02:29:08.606 --> 02:29:14.112 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:15.413 region:rollup2
SO GETTING BACK TO.

02:29:14.112 --> 02:29:16.881 region:rollup2
WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:29:15.413 --> 02:29:18.283 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON IN TWO THOUSAND

02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:19.384 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN WHICH IS REALLY TENURE

02:29:18.283 --> 02:29:21.419 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS?

02:29:19.384 --> 02:29:22.654 region:rollup2
WHAT WE KNOW IN THE STATE OF

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:24.055 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS THAT TENER

02:29:22.654 --> 02:29:25.356 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS ARE THE BY FAR THE

02:29:24.055 --> 02:29:26.991 region:rollup2
EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE IN OUR

02:29:25.356 --> 02:29:27.859 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES?

02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:30.328 region:rollup2
ONLY.

02:29:27.859 --> 02:29:31.496 region:rollup2
ONLY TWELVE CALIFORNIA CITIES

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:33.865 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME FOR IMMIGRANTS TO LOOK

02:29:31.496 --> 02:29:35.533 region:rollup2
STABILIZATION IN ONLY SEVENTEEN

02:29:33.865 --> 02:29:37.135 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES HAVE.

02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:38.937 region:rollup2
JUST CAUSE FOR ADDICTS

02:29:37.135 --> 02:29:40.471 region:rollup2
PREDICTIONS PROTECTIONS THAT

02:29:38.937 --> 02:29:41.806 region:rollup2
MEANS EVERYWHERE ELSE WHICH IS

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:43.441 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR

02:29:41.806 --> 02:29:44.876 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE

02:29:43.441 --> 02:29:46.344 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS RIGHT SO YOUR

02:29:44.876 --> 02:29:48.379 region:rollup2
LANDLORD CAN RAISE THE RENT

02:29:46.344 --> 02:29:51.783 region:rollup2
HOWEVER MUCH HE WANTS OR HE OR

02:29:48.379 --> 02:29:53.251 region:rollup2
SHE WANTS. A AT ANY WELL AFTER

02:29:51.783 --> 02:29:54.552 region:rollup2
YOUR LEASE IS UP AT ANYTIME.

02:29:53.251 --> 02:29:56.087 region:rollup2
IN THOSE PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE

02:29:54.552 --> 02:29:58.089 region:rollup2
RENT STABILIZATION OR THEY

02:29:56.087 --> 02:29:59.624 region:rollup2
CONVICT YOU FOR NO REASON AT ALL

02:29:58.089 --> 02:30:00.592 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GIVE A REASON

02:29:59.624 --> 02:30:02.126 region:rollup2
IF THEY WANT YOU OUT OF THERE

02:30:00.592 --> 02:30:04.696 region:rollup2
UNITS.

02:30:02.126 --> 02:30:06.831 region:rollup2
TO.

02:30:04.696 --> 02:30:09.100 region:rollup2
SO I JUST WANNA END HERE WITH

02:30:06.831 --> 02:30:11.202 region:rollup2
THESE PRE FIVE BIG BUS BUCKETS

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:11.736 region:rollup2
OF THE NET NECESSARY ACTIONS

02:30:11.202 --> 02:30:13.505 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:30:11.736 --> 02:30:14.806 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT AND I DON'T

02:30:13.505 --> 02:30:16.608 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE TIME TO GO INTO

02:30:14.806 --> 02:30:18.142 region:rollup2
DETAIL ON EACH OF THESE BUT.

02:30:16.608 --> 02:30:19.911 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

02:30:18.142 --> 02:30:21.479 region:rollup2
ON THE FIRST ONE REALLY IS ABOUT

02:30:19.911 --> 02:30:23.381 region:rollup2
SHIELDING TENANTS FROM RENT HIKE

02:30:21.479 --> 02:30:24.716 region:rollup2
SO IN THEIR UNITS ALLOWING THEM

02:30:23.381 --> 02:30:26.751 region:rollup2
TO STAY IN NOT BEING SURPRISED

02:30:24.716 --> 02:30:28.920 region:rollup2
BY. YOU KNOW THE TWENTY THIRTY

02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:30.588 region:rollup2
FIFTY DOUBLING RENTS THAT WE ARE

02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:32.690 region:rollup2
SEEING IN SOME OF OUR HOT MARKET

02:30:30.588 --> 02:30:33.992 region:rollup2
CITIES.

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:35.793 region:rollup2
UP THAT WE'RE PROTECTING TENANTS

02:30:33.992 --> 02:30:37.228 region:rollup2
FROM UNFAIR EVICTIONS RIGHT

02:30:35.793 --> 02:30:39.430 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THE WHOLE NAM

02:30:37.228 --> 02:30:40.798 region:rollup2
OR HAS SOME SORT OF ACTUAL JUST

02:30:39.430 --> 02:30:43.268 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FOR EVICTING.

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:45.169 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENING ANTI RETALIATION

02:30:43.268 --> 02:30:47.205 region:rollup2
LAWS RIGHT NOW I MEAN. IT'S

02:30:45.169 --> 02:30:48.973 region:rollup2
REALLY NOT THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE

02:30:47.205 --> 02:30:50.108 region:rollup2
RATE AYE IF YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT

02:30:48.973 --> 02:30:53.278 region:rollup2
YOUR LANDLORD.

02:30:50.108 --> 02:30:55.547 region:rollup2
NOT FIXING YOUR SINK.

02:30:53.278 --> 02:30:57.148 region:rollup2
WELL WE SAY BY LAW THAT THEY

CAN'T RETALIATE EVICT YOU THEY

02:30:57.148 --> 02:30:59.951 region:rollup2
REALLY CAN IT'S VERY HARD TO

02:30:58.283 --> 02:31:01.519 region:rollup2
PROVE.

02:30:59.951 --> 02:31:03.054 region:rollup2
AND AND CLEARLY IN SOME THE

02:31:01.519 --> 02:31:04.622 region:rollup2
WORK I KNOW YOU ALL ARE WORKING

02:31:03.054 --> 02:31:06.291 region:rollup2
ON IS IS CREATING REALLY

02:31:04.622 --> 02:31:08.993 region:rollup2
REASONABLE PROCEDURES SO THAT WE

02:31:06.291 --> 02:31:10.094 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE A FAIR SYSTEM.

02:31:08.993 --> 02:31:11.563 region:rollup2
LET'S IMPROVE SUBSTANDARD

02:31:10.094 --> 02:31:12.964 region:rollup2
HOUSING SO WE DON'T SEE GHOST

02:31:11.563 --> 02:31:15.700 region:rollup2
SHIP FIRES HAPPENING.

02:31:12.964 --> 02:31:16.868 region:rollup2
IN THAT WHEN PEOPLE DO COMPLAIN

02:31:15.700 --> 02:31:18.336 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:31:16.868 --> 02:31:20.004 region:rollup2
EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES OR

02:31:18.336 --> 02:31:21.339 region:rollup2
THEIR NOT BEING FORCED OUT

02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:22.540 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEIR LANDLORD ISN'T

02:31:21.339 --> 02:31:24.576 region:rollup2
KEEPING THEIR UNITS UP.

02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:25.577 region:rollup2
.

02:31:24.576 --> 02:31:27.278 region:rollup2
THEY CAN SURE ACCESS TO

02:31:25.577 --> 02:31:29.614 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION SO RIGHT TO

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:31.482 region:rollup2
COUNSEL WE KNOW THAT WHEN WHEN

02:31:29.614 --> 02:31:32.951 region:rollup2
TENANTS DON'T HAVE

02:31:31.482 --> 02:31:34.953 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION THEY DON'T WIN.

02:31:32.951 --> 02:31:36.387 region:rollup2
A IN COURT.

02:31:34.953 --> 02:31:38.222 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY ABOUT

02:31:36.387 --> 02:31:40.091 region:rollup2
PRESERVING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

02:31:38.222 --> 02:31:40.558 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS I KNOW THAT A LOT OF

02:31:40.091 --> 02:31:41.326 region:rollup2
WORKS OR EVEN DONE ON

02:31:40.558 --> 02:31:43.061 region:rollup2
PRESERVING.

02:31:41.326 --> 02:31:44.562 region:rollup2
.

02:31:43.061 --> 02:31:46.097 region:rollup2
DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE

02:31:44.562 --> 02:31:47.632 region:rollup2
UNITS BUT REALLY THINKING ABOUT

02:31:46.097 --> 02:31:49.200 region:rollup2
THOSE UNITS THAT ARE NOT DE

02:31:47.632 --> 02:31:50.535 region:rollup2
RESTRICTED THAT ARE WHAT PEOPLE

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:52.103 region:rollup2
LIKE TO CALL NATURALLY OCCURRING

02:31:50.535 --> 02:31:53.304 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:31:52.103 --> 02:31:55.206 region:rollup2
REALLY DOING MORE TO THINK ABOUT

02:31:53.304 --> 02:31:56.407 region:rollup2
WHERE THOSE ARE HAD WE STABILIZE

02:31:55.206 --> 02:31:57.875 region:rollup2
THEM AND WE TAKE THEM OFF THE

02:31:56.407 --> 02:31:59.177 region:rollup2
MARKET HOW DO WE DO A BETTER JOB

02:31:57.875 --> 02:32:03.114 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHEN THEY'RE PART

02:31:59.177 --> 02:32:04.315 region:rollup2
ABOUT TO GO ON SALE.

02:32:03.114 --> 02:32:09.687 region:rollup2
SO I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THAT

02:32:04.315 --> 02:32:11.322 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:32:09.687 --> 02:32:11.622 region:rollup2
JUST GOV THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

02:32:11.322 --> 02:32:13.324 region:rollup2
BEING HERE.

02:32:11.622 --> 02:32:15.226 region:rollup2
.

02:32:13.324 --> 02:32:17.629 region:rollup2
WHAT SOLUTIONS WHICH YOU HAVE

02:32:15.226 --> 02:32:19.297 region:rollup2
TO THE?

02:32:17.629 --> 02:32:20.832 region:rollup2
SHOOTING.

02:32:19.297 --> 02:32:23.968 region:rollup2
TENANTS FROM RENT HIKES

02:32:20.832 --> 02:32:26.904 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THOSE.

02:32:23.968 --> 02:32:29.307 region:rollup2
IDEAS YOU HAD TO PROTECT.

02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:30.708 region:rollup2
TENANTS OUT WE DO.

02:32:29.307 --> 02:32:34.112 region:rollup2
SO YOU MEAN BEYOND RENT

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:38.182 region:rollup2
STABILIZATION. YEAH AND THEN.

02:32:34.112 --> 02:32:40.084 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO REPRESENTATION.

02:32:38.182 --> 02:32:41.919 region:rollup2
SO I MEAN RIGHT NOW IT'S THE

02:32:40.084 --> 02:32:44.922 region:rollup2
CITY OF NEW YORK PASSED A.

02:32:41.919 --> 02:32:46.891 region:rollup2
TENET RIGHT TO COUNSEL LAW.

02:32:44.922 --> 02:32:48.960 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE TWO YEARS AGO NOW.

02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:51.029 region:rollup2
THIS ROLLING OUT RIGHT NOW.

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:51.496 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR A CASE THAT'S BEING

02:32:51.029 --> 02:32:53.031 region:rollup2
ROLLED OUT RIGHT NOW.

02:32:51.496 --> 02:32:54.732 region:rollup2
.

02:32:53.031 --> 02:32:56.300 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS PROVIDING

02:32:54.732 --> 02:32:57.668 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION TOO I THINK IS

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:58.736 region:rollup2
BELOW TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE

02:32:57.668 --> 02:33:02.240 region:rollup2
POVERTY LEVEL.

02:32:58.736 --> 02:33:03.374 region:rollup2
SO SO NOT JUST THE LOWEST

02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:05.343 region:rollup2
INCOME.

02:33:03.374 --> 02:33:07.178 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S NEARLY

02:33:05.343 --> 02:33:09.247 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET REPRESENTATION

02:33:07.178 --> 02:33:10.214 region:rollup2
I MEAN THERE'S SOME IF YOU'RE IF

02:33:09.247 --> 02:33:12.150 region:rollup2
YOU'RE VERY LOW INCOME MADE YOU

02:33:10.214 --> 02:33:13.017 region:rollup2
CAN GET REPRESENTATION BUT IT'S

02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:15.119 region:rollup2
VERY HARD TO FIND A LAWYER.

02:33:13.017 --> 02:33:16.287 region:rollup2
.

02:33:15.119 --> 02:33:17.855 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS CREATING A FUN AND

02:33:16.287 --> 02:33:19.290 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO'S CONSIDERING THIS

02:33:17.855 --> 02:33:20.124 region:rollup2
NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE

02:33:19.290 --> 02:33:21.793 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

02:33:20.124 --> 02:33:23.061 region:rollup2
YEAH I KNOW THE MAYOR'S OFFICE

02:33:21.793 --> 02:33:24.729 region:rollup2
HOUSING WAS WORKING ON SOME

02:33:23.061 --> 02:33:26.464 region:rollup2
BUDGETS FOR THAT.

02:33:24.729 --> 02:33:27.331 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

02:33:26.464 --> 02:33:29.467 region:rollup2
HAPPENING ON IT.

02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:30.535 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT IT'S EFFECTIVE MY

02:33:29.467 --> 02:33:32.737 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT.

02:33:30.535 --> 02:33:34.005 region:rollup2
SOME WORK THAT HAPPEN THAT DOC

02:33:32.737 --> 02:33:35.273 region:rollup2
MERELY BECAUSE SERVICES OF EAST

02:33:34.005 --> 02:33:36.574 region:rollup2
PALO ALTO PUT OUT.

02:33:35.273 --> 02:33:37.442 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY SAID FOR PLACES

02:33:36.574 --> 02:33:39.844 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T HAVE TENURE

02:33:37.442 --> 02:33:41.446 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS RIGHT TO COUNSEL IS.

02:33:39.844 --> 02:33:43.581 region:rollup2
HELPING ABOUT.

IN GREEK DECREASING EVICTIONS OR

02:33:43.581 --> 02:33:45.850 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE LENGTH THAT YOU

02:33:44.615 --> 02:33:47.785 region:rollup2
CAN STAY IN YOUR APARTMENT BY

02:33:45.850 --> 02:33:49.520 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT FOR PLACES

02:33:47.785 --> 02:33:51.189 region:rollup2
THAT DO HAVE PROTECTIONS. IT'S%

02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:52.490 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AT ROUTE EIGHTY

02:33:51.189 --> 02:33:53.691 region:rollup2
PERCENT SO.

02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:56.360 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY HELPFUL AND

02:33:53.691 --> 02:33:57.695 region:rollup2
NECESSARY. COME.

02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:59.464 region:rollup2
STATE FUNDS A LOT OF THE LEGAL

02:33:57.695 --> 02:34:00.631 region:rollup2
AID PROGRAMS

02:33:59.464 --> 02:34:02.533 region:rollup2
IS THAT IS THAT WHERE THEY WOULD

02:34:00.631 --> 02:34:04.702 region:rollup2
GET REPRESENTATION.

02:34:02.533 --> 02:34:06.037 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW YES BUT IT'S HARD TO

02:34:04.702 --> 02:34:07.605 region:rollup2
QUALIFY AND IF YOU ARE

02:34:06.037 --> 02:34:10.041 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED YOU'D THERE'S NO

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:12.276 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AT ALL.

02:34:10.041 --> 02:34:14.045 region:rollup2
OR VERY FEW.

02:34:12.276 --> 02:34:16.180 region:rollup2
YEAH SO WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO

02:34:14.045 --> 02:34:19.250 region:rollup2
THAT I'M ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:19.751 region:rollup2
THAT DEALS WITH THE JUDICIARY'S.

02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:19.984 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT WE LASH WE

02:34:19.751 --> 02:34:21.586 region:rollup2
INCREASE

02:34:19.984 --> 02:34:22.086 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

02:34:21.586 --> 02:34:24.155 region:rollup2
I ASKED HER WHAT KOWSKI

02:34:22.086 --> 02:34:25.223 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

02:34:24.155 --> 02:34:28.559 region:rollup2
CHAPIN DOT BECAUSE SO.

02:34:25.223 --> 02:34:29.260 region:rollup2
.

02:34:28.559 --> 02:34:32.563 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW WE CAN LOOK AT IT.

02:34:29.260 --> 02:34:34.665 region:rollup2
GREAT.

02:34:32.563 --> 02:34:36.033 region:rollup2
SENATE ALLEN.

02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:37.368 region:rollup2
I'M I JUST WANT TO ASK ABOUT IT

02:34:36.033 --> 02:34:39.570 region:rollup2
AND THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION

02:34:37.368 --> 02:34:41.439 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:43.441 region:rollup2
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY YOU KNOW

02:34:41.439 --> 02:34:45.977 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN AND.

02:34:43.441 --> 02:34:47.545 region:rollup2
SO MEMBERS PROP FOR THE.

02:34:45.977 --> 02:34:49.213 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS REPEAL BILL.

02:34:47.545 --> 02:34:50.815 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE.

02:34:49.213 --> 02:34:52.550 region:rollup2
I REMEMBER THAT ONE OF THE BIG

02:34:50.815 --> 02:34:54.018 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS.

02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:56.320 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MADE WAS THAT RENT

02:34:54.018 --> 02:34:56.854 region:rollup2
STABILIZATION RENT CONTROL TETRA

02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:58.222 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS A DELETERIOUS

02:34:56.854 --> 02:34:58.389 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

02:34:58.222 --> 02:35:00.191 region:rollup2
ON.

02:34:58.389 --> 02:35:01.192 region:rollup2
.

02:35:00.191 --> 02:35:03.127 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

02:35:01.192 --> 02:35:05.563 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT.

02:35:03.127 --> 02:35:07.465 region:rollup2
YOU SENSE THAT MARKET SIGNALS

02:35:05.563 --> 02:35:07.999 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOARD IN THAT I'M OUT

02:35:07.465 --> 02:35:09.167 region:rollup2
OF THE ARGUMENT WAS MADE.

02:35:07.999 --> 02:35:11.502 region:rollup2
AGAINST

02:35:09.167 --> 02:35:12.537 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

02:35:11.502 --> 02:35:14.138 region:rollup2
YEAH CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT

02:35:12.537 --> 02:35:16.240 region:rollup2
TO THAT ARGUMENT AND AND SOME OF

02:35:14.138 --> 02:35:16.841 region:rollup2
THE RESEARCH YOU'VE DONE AND.

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:19.310 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MAKING A VERY DIFFERENT

02:35:16.841 --> 02:35:21.779 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT HERE TODAY.

02:35:19.310 --> 02:35:23.214 region:rollup2
SO NOT NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT

02:35:21.779 --> 02:35:26.617 region:rollup2
RENT STABILIZATION.

02:35:23.214 --> 02:35:26.884 region:rollup2
SO MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THAT

02:35:26.617 --> 02:35:28.786 region:rollup2
RESEARCH.

02:35:26.884 --> 02:35:30.588 region:rollup2
.

02:35:28.786 --> 02:35:31.856 region:rollup2
IS IT I MEAN.

02:35:30.588 --> 02:35:33.891 region:rollup2
SO THE ONLY RESEARCH I'VE SEEN

02:35:31.856 --> 02:35:34.959 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION WAS

02:35:33.891 --> 02:35:36.627 region:rollup2
FROM SAINT THIS RECENT SAN

02:35:34.959 --> 02:35:37.995 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO STUD STUDY OF SAN

02:35:36.627 --> 02:35:39.564 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO FROM STANFORD.

02:35:37.995 --> 02:35:40.565 region:rollup2
RESEARCHER.

02:35:39.564 --> 02:35:42.533 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS LOOKING AT THE

02:35:40.565 --> 02:35:43.968 region:rollup2
EXPANSION OF RENT CONTROL IN THE

02:35:42.533 --> 02:35:45.336 region:rollup2
CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO.

02:35:43.968 --> 02:35:46.704 region:rollup2
AND THE ARGUMENT MY

02:35:45.336 --> 02:35:47.171 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING FROM MY READ OF

02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:49.674 region:rollup2
THE REPORT WAS THAT IT

02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:51.642 region:rollup2
INCREASED.

02:35:49.674 --> 02:35:53.611 region:rollup2
RENTS IN THE CITY BECAUSE

02:35:51.642 --> 02:35:55.613 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS WERE REMOVING UNITS

02:35:53.611 --> 02:35:57.949 region:rollup2
FROM THE RENT CONTROL MARKET SO

02:35:55.613 --> 02:35:59.984 region:rollup2
THEY WERE INCREASING CONVERSIONS

02:35:57.949 --> 02:36:01.319 region:rollup2
TO. TEN SEASON COMMENT AND CONDO

02:35:59.984 --> 02:36:04.021 region:rollup2
CONVERSIONS

02:36:01.319 --> 02:36:06.224 region:rollup2
SO IN THAT CASE I WOULD SAY THE

02:36:04.021 --> 02:36:07.558 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THERE IS. GREAT CONTROL

02:36:06.224 --> 02:36:09.393 region:rollup2
BECAUSE LANDLORDS DON'T DON'T

02:36:07.558 --> 02:36:11.229 region:rollup2
WANT TO DEAL WITH IT.

02:36:09.393 --> 02:36:13.197 region:rollup2
ART YOU KNOW FOR.

02:36:11.229 --> 02:36:15.933 region:rollup2
PROBABLY SOME OBVIOUS REASONS.

02:36:13.197 --> 02:36:17.235 region:rollup2
THEY WERE REMOVING THEIR UNITS

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:18.936 region:rollup2
FROM THE RENT CONTROL MARKET I

02:36:17.235 --> 02:36:20.238 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THIS MIGHT BE.

02:36:18.936 --> 02:36:21.806 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO SOME OF THE CONDO

02:36:20.238 --> 02:36:24.375 region:rollup2
CONVERSION LAWS.

02:36:21.806 --> 02:36:26.177 region:rollup2
IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT.

02:36:24.375 --> 02:36:27.745 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT IT MAY BE MORE OF

02:36:26.177 --> 02:36:30.781 region:rollup2
AN ENFORCEMENT QUESTION.

02:36:27.745 --> 02:36:31.349 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE REDUCING THE SUPPLY

02:36:30.781 --> 02:36:33.050 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE THE RENTS ARE

02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:34.518 region:rollup2
GOING UP.

02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:35.920 region:rollup2
SO THE ARGUMENT WOULD BE WELL

02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:38.489 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE

02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:40.925 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF RENT CONTROL PER SE ON

02:36:38.489 --> 02:36:42.660 region:rollup2
THE MARKET RATE UNITS BUT RATHER

02:36:40.925 --> 02:36:45.696 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ARE REMOVING UNITS

02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:47.632 region:rollup2
FROM THE MARKET AND THEREFORE.

02:36:45.696 --> 02:36:50.134 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE DOING A BETTER JOB

02:36:47.632 --> 02:36:52.637 region:rollup2
ENFORCING OUR.

02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:53.170 region:rollup2
CONDO CONVERSION OR. YOUR NOSE

02:36:52.637 --> 02:36:54.405 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO THE

02:36:53.170 --> 02:36:57.808 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE WAS THAT.

02:36:54.405 --> 02:36:58.843 region:rollup2
IT IN THE MOVIE YOU CAN SPEAK

02:36:57.808 --> 02:37:00.678 region:rollup2
TO THIS TOO GIVEN YOUR WORK IN.

02:36:58.843 --> 02:37:03.781 region:rollup2
THIS AREA. ON THE DEVELOPMENT

02:37:00.678 --> 02:37:06.784 region:rollup2
SIDE. THAT THAT AND IT IMPACTS

02:37:03.781 --> 02:37:08.252 region:rollup2
THE WILLINGNESS OF DEVELOPERS TO

02:37:06.784 --> 02:37:10.288 region:rollup2
WANT TO ENTER INTO.

02:37:08.252 --> 02:37:12.757 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOUSING.

02:37:10.288 --> 02:37:15.026 region:rollup2
NO. IT HOUSING MARKET BECAUSE

02:37:12.757 --> 02:37:15.660 region:rollup2
THEY LOOK AT IT IS.

02:37:15.026 --> 02:37:17.895 region:rollup2
HURTING THEIR BOTTOM LINE IN THE

02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:19.964 region:rollup2
LONG TERM.

02:37:17.895 --> 02:37:21.499 region:rollup2
SO I THINK PART OF THAT AND I

02:37:19.964 --> 02:37:22.867 region:rollup2
GUESS THIS IS PART OF THE HEART

02:37:21.499 --> 02:37:25.436 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS IN EX THE

02:37:22.867 --> 02:37:27.038 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION OF NEW CONSTRUCTION.

02:37:25.436 --> 02:37:28.306 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:37:27.038 --> 02:37:29.874 region:rollup2
I MEAN THE RESEARCH THAT'S OUT

02:37:28.306 --> 02:37:31.976 region:rollup2
THERE THERE IS LOOKED AT THE

02:37:29.874 --> 02:37:34.145 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF RENT STABILIZATION ON

02:37:31.976 --> 02:37:35.246 region:rollup2
NEW HOUSING PRODUCTION HAS NOT

02:37:34.145 --> 02:37:36.747 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT IT HAD A NEGATIVE

02:37:35.246 --> 02:37:37.715 region:rollup2
IMPACT THERE'S BEEN RESEARCH IN

02:37:36.747 --> 02:37:39.517 region:rollup2
NEW YORK.

02:37:37.715 --> 02:37:41.018 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN RESEARCH IN THE

02:37:39.517 --> 02:37:42.320 region:rollup2
STATE OF NEW JERSEY THAT HAS

02:37:41.018 --> 02:37:43.854 region:rollup2
LIKE OVER A HUNDRED

IT WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN

02:40:32.957 --> 02:40:37.428 region:rollup2
INFLUENCING.

02:40:34.992 --> 02:40:39.163 region:rollup2
GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT

02:40:37.428 --> 02:40:40.531 region:rollup2

THIS THE SPECULATIVE MARKET IN

02:42:43.287 --> 02:42:47.124 region:rollup2
THOSE AREAS RIGHT NOW SO I THINK

02:42:45.089 --> 02:42:48.859 region:rollup2
THERE IS ACTUALLY. QUITE A BIT

02:42:47.124 --> 02:42:49.760 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE DONE QUITE A BIT THE

02:42:48.859 --> 02:42:50.794 region:rollup2
CAN BE ADDED TO THIS BILL MY

02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:52.429 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU ALL

02:42:50.794 --> 02:42:53.697 region:rollup2

THAT ARE THAT SENATOR WIENER

02:42:53.697 --> 02:42:56.900 region:rollup2
STAFF IS.

02:42:55.499 --> 02:42:57.868 region:rollup2
IN IT SO I THINK THERE'S

02:42:56.900 --> 02:42:59.637 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

02:42:57.868 --> 02:43:01.005 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE NEED NEW HOUSING NEAR

02:42:59.637 --> 02:43:02.906 region:rollup2
TRANSIT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO

02:43:01.005 --> 02:43:04.341 region:rollup2
QUESTION WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR

02:43:02.906 --> 02:43:06.010 region:rollup2

02:43:32.736 --> 02:43:34.204 region:rollup2

02:43:34.204 --> 02:43:37.107 region:rollup2
COMMENT.

02:43:36.173 --> 02:43:38.475 region:rollup2
OKAY A TO INDIVIDUALS.

02:43:37.107 --> 02:43:42.212 region:rollup2
.

02:43:38.475 --> 02:43:55.793 region:rollup2
PLEASE STEP UP.

02:43:42.212 --> 02:43:57.127 region:rollup2
SHORT.

02:43:55.793 --> 02:43:58.128 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SURE REPORT

02:43:57.127 --> 02:43:59.596 region:rollup2
WITH THE CORPORATION FOR

02:43:58.128 --> 02:44:01.565 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

02:43:59.596 --> 02:44:03.534 region:rollup2
I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON THE

02:44:01.565 --> 02:44:05.302 region:rollup2
SP TO YOUR ONE FUNDING FOR

02:44:03.534 --> 02:44:06.236 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS.

02:44:05.302 --> 02:44:08.739 region:rollup2
AND.

02:44:06.236 --> 02:44:10.407 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY WE ARE GOAL IS TO

02:44:08.739 --> 02:44:11.942 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT FUNDING AS IMPACTFUL

02:44:10.407 --> 02:44:14.111 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE TO SUSTAINABLE AS

02:44:11.942 --> 02:44:15.446 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE. TO DO THAT WE REALLY

02:44:14.111 --> 02:44:15.879 region:rollup2
DO NOT BELIEVE IT SHOULD GO OUT

02:44:15.446 --> 02:44:18.315 region:rollup2
BY FORMULA TO EVERY

02:44:15.879 --> 02:44:19.550 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION.

02:44:18.315 --> 02:44:20.918 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT SHOULD BE FOR

02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:22.686 region:rollup2
SELECTORS TO ACTIONS TO

02:44:20.918 --> 02:44:24.488 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE NEED AND COMMITMENT.

02:44:22.686 --> 02:44:26.190 region:rollup2
.

02:44:24.488 --> 02:44:27.291 region:rollup2
FIRST THE STAND ABILITY WE THINK

02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:28.992 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMITMENT OF THOSE

02:44:27.291 --> 02:44:31.061 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION SHOULD BE THAT THEY

02:44:28.992 --> 02:44:33.997 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA COMMIT FUTURE SP TWO

02:44:31.061 --> 02:44:36.166 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. FOR THE SAME PURPOSES.

02:44:33.997 --> 02:44:37.868 region:rollup2
WE ALSO I THINK THAT THERE

02:44:36.166 --> 02:44:40.137 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE SOME LEVEL OF

02:44:37.868 --> 02:44:41.472 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO YOUR COMMENT.

02:44:40.137 --> 02:44:43.941 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU AROUND

02:44:41.472 --> 02:44:45.609 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY VERSES TARGETED USE

02:44:43.941 --> 02:44:47.144 region:rollup2
OF THOSE RESOURCES.

02:44:45.609 --> 02:44:49.146 region:rollup2
THERE SHOULD BE SOME FLEXIBILITY

02:44:47.144 --> 02:44:50.647 region:rollup2
BUT STILL TRYING TO MEET THE GAP

02:44:49.146 --> 02:44:52.082 region:rollup2
AND HOUSING NEEDS.

02:44:50.647 --> 02:44:54.051 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO HAVE THE BIGGEST

02:44:52.082 --> 02:44:55.853 region:rollup2
IMPACT AND THAT IN OUR OPINION

02:44:54.051 --> 02:44:57.287 region:rollup2
WE AGREE WITH MR COLONY. THAT

02:44:55.853 --> 02:44:59.323 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING SHOULD GO FOR

02:44:57.287 --> 02:45:00.557 region:rollup2
OPERATING SUBSIDIES AND RENTAL

02:44:59.323 --> 02:45:01.992 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE PRIMARILY.

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:03.026 region:rollup2
.

02:45:01.992 --> 02:45:05.162 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE DONE THROUGH A

02:45:03.026 --> 02:45:07.364 region:rollup2
RENTAL ASSISTANCE POOL THAT

02:45:05.162 --> 02:45:09.133 region:rollup2
COULD FUND A VARIETY OF MEASURES

02:45:07.364 --> 02:45:11.368 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL NEED.

02:45:09.133 --> 02:45:13.937 region:rollup2
WE DO THINK THAT THE FUNDING

02:45:11.368 --> 02:45:15.072 region:rollup2
SHOULD ALSO BE FOCUSED ON PEOPLE

02:45:13.937 --> 02:45:17.775 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING CHRONIC

02:45:15.072 --> 02:45:18.809 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS OTHER STATES HAVE

02:45:17.775 --> 02:45:19.309 region:rollup2
DONE THAT AND I HAVE SEEN

02:45:18.809 --> 02:45:21.078 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC.

02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:22.780 region:rollup2
DECREASES IN CHRONIC

02:45:21.078 --> 02:45:24.081 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS WHEREAS IN OUR

02:45:22.780 --> 02:45:25.215 region:rollup2
STATE WE HAVE NOW FORTY TWO

02:45:24.081 --> 02:45:26.617 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE NATION'S

CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATION

02:45:26.617 --> 02:45:30.721 region:rollup2

02:45:27.851 --> 02:45:32.256 region:rollup2
SHARE INCREASES EVERY YEAR.

02:45:30.721 --> 02:45:32.890 region:rollup2
I'M AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD TO

02:45:32.256 --> 02:45:35.092 region:rollup2
SAY THAT.

02:45:32.890 --> 02:45:37.728 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:45:35.092 --> 02:45:40.998 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING IS SUSTAINABLE.

02:45:37.728 --> 02:45:43.033 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT IS OF THOSE LOCAL

02:45:40.998 --> 02:45:44.735 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS ARE COMMITTING

02:45:43.033 --> 02:45:46.804 region:rollup2

ENSURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE

02:45:48.572 --> 02:45:52.009 region:rollup2
RENTAL SYSTEMS COULD BE SO

02:45:50.073 --> 02:45:54.211 region:rollup2
