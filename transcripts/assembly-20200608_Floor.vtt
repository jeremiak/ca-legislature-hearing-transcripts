LITTLE ON CLOSING GAPS IN PART

02:28:08.546 --> 02:28:09.747
OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT

02:28:09.814 --> 02:28:11.916
WE FOCUS MUCH MORE ON INPUTS

02:28:11.983 --> 02:28:15.052
THAN WE DO ON OUTPUTS AND EVEN

02:28:15.119 --> 02:28:15.987
WHEN IT COMES TO INPUTS I AS

THE AUTHOR HAS EXPLAINED- WE'VE

02:28:18.022 --> 02:28:21.058
HAD- FAR TOO LITTLE- ASSURANCE

THAT THE ADDED FUNDS THAT WE'RE

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:24.295
PROVIDING TO DISTRICTS. ARE

02:28:24.362 --> 02:28:25.830
BEING USED IN THE WAY THAT

02:28:25.896 --> 02:28:26.864
THEIR INTENDED TO HELP STUDENTS

FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER AND A

02:28:48.052 --> 02:28:50.488
JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS NOT ONLY

02:28:50.554 --> 02:28:53.858
AUDIT. BUT THIS BILL I SEE A

02:28:53.924 --> 02:28:55.793
MAJOR KNEE NOW ESPECIALLY

02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:57.895
THROUGH OUR COVERT NINETEEN AS

02:28:57.962 --> 02:29:01.432
WE SEE CLEARLY. THAT OUR

02:29:01.499 --> 02:29:04.835
STUDENTS THAT ARE. UP AT RISK

02:29:04.902 --> 02:29:07.872
OR EVEN MORE AT RISK. IF THAT

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:10.107
COULD BE POSSIBLE WHICH MEANS

02:29:10.174 --> 02:29:13.044
THAT MANY MANY OF OUR STUDENTS

02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:15.546
OF COLOR. HAVE NOT EVEN LOGGED

02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:17.415
ON ONE TIME- THROUGH THEIR

02:29:17.481 --> 02:29:19.784
EDUCATION- SOME BECAUSE THEY

02:29:19.850 --> 02:29:21.986
DON'T HAVE A BROADBAND AND SO

02:29:22.053 --> 02:29:23.587
FORTH BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:29:23.654 --> 02:29:25.389
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:27.725
THEY NEED TO PUSH THEM OUT

02:29:27.792 --> 02:29:29.660
WHERE THEY NEED TO EXCEL IN.

02:29:29.727 --> 02:29:31.796
OVER TEN YEARS AGO I STARTED AN

02:29:31.862 --> 02:29:33.764
ACHIEVEMENT GAP GROUP AN ORANGE

02:29:33.831 --> 02:29:36.367
COUNTY THAT WAS FOCUSING ON THE

02:29:36.434 --> 02:29:38.602
CHIEF MEANT GAP AND WE DIDN'T

02:29:38.669 --> 02:29:41.372
HAVE. SOME OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS

02:29:41.439 --> 02:29:43.140
THAT COULD EVEN USE THE WORD

02:29:43.207 --> 02:29:44.442
ACHIEVEMENT GAP BECAUSE THEY

02:29:44.508 --> 02:29:46.644
DID NOT BELIEVE TEN YEARS AGO

02:29:46.711 --> 02:29:48.412
THAT THE CHIEF MEANT GAP.

02:29:48.479 --> 02:29:50.848
EXISTED NOW NOT ONLY DO WE SEE

02:29:50.915 --> 02:29:53.451
T WE SEE THAT IT ALSO PERSISTS

02:29:53.517 --> 02:29:55.953
AND WE MUST WE MUST USE THAT

02:29:56.020 --> 02:29:57.688
FUNDING FROM THE LOCAL CONTROL

02:29:57.755 --> 02:30:00.091
FUNDING FORMULA TO GO EXACTLY

02:30:00.157 --> 02:30:01.726
WHERE THOSE STUDENTS THAT THOSE

02:30:01.792 --> 02:30:03.828
FUNDS ARE MEANT TO BE. AND IN

02:30:03.894 --> 02:30:06.564
ADDITION NOT TO ROLL THAT FUNDS

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:07.965
OVER INTO THE GENERAL FUND

02:30:08.032 --> 02:30:09.200
WHERE MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS

02:30:09.266 --> 02:30:11.001
WILL NOT SEE THAT SUPPORT SO I

02:30:11.068 --> 02:30:14.071
STAND HERE IN SUPPORT. OF THIS

02:30:14.138 --> 02:30:17.541

I'M GONNA RESPECTFULLY YEAH LAY

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:26.050
OFF THE BILL. BUT I THINK IT'S

02:30:26.117 --> 02:30:28.753
IMPORTANT TO EXPLAIN WHY. WE

02:30:28.819 --> 02:30:32.623
TALK ABOUT INPUTS AND OUTPUTS

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:34.692
AND SUCCESS AND ACHIEVEMENT. I

02:30:34.759 --> 02:30:35.626
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:37.294
REPRESENTING CLOVIS UNIFIED

02:30:37.361 --> 02:30:38.529
SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY WERE ONE

02:30:38.596 --> 02:30:41.198

RESPECT. FOR OUR AUDITOR. WHAT

02:30:47.905 --> 02:30:49.840
I THINK WE FAIL TO REALIZE IN

02:30:49.907 --> 02:30:55.179
THIS IS THAT THE USE OF FUNDS

02:30:55.246 --> 02:30:55.946
BY CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL

02:30:56.013 --> 02:31:00.418
DISTRICT HAS IN FACT CREATED.

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:01.752
ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR

02:31:01.819 --> 02:31:05.222
SUCCESSFUL APPROACHES TOWARD

02:31:05.289 --> 02:31:06.857

LEARNERS OP. AND THOSE WHO ARE

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:12.863
IN POVERTY IN FACT CLOVIS

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS.

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:18.669
LOTS OF FAMILIES AND STUDENTS

02:31:18.736 --> 02:31:20.571
WHO ARE MOVING FROM OTHER

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:23.741
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN TO CLOVIS

02:31:23.808 --> 02:31:25.276
AT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:31:25.342 --> 02:31:27.845
STATISTICS AND IF YOU LOOK AT

02:31:27.912 --> 02:31:30.314
THE SUCCESS. CLOVIS UNIFIED

02:31:30.381 --> 02:31:31.916
SCHOOL DISTRICT DOES A

02:31:31.982 --> 02:31:35.119
REMARKABLE JOB. THEY USE SOME

02:31:35.186 --> 02:31:38.522
OF THOSE DISCRETION FUNDS FOR

02:31:38.589 --> 02:31:42.026
APPROPRIATE USES THAT HELP. THE

02:31:42.092 --> 02:31:44.862
STUDENTS ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE

02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:47.631
CATEGORICALLY PERFECT IT DOES

02:31:47.698 --> 02:31:51.035
RESULT IN HUGE IMPROVEMENTS

02:31:51.101 --> 02:31:53.237
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. CLOVIS

02:31:53.304 --> 02:31:57.775
UNIFIED HAS A PROGRAM THAT PUTS

02:31:57.842 --> 02:32:01.879
OUR MENTORS SIDE BY SIDE WITH

02:32:01.946 --> 02:32:04.248
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND

02:32:04.315 --> 02:32:06.917
WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE. IT IN

02:32:06.984 --> 02:32:08.419
UNFORTUNATELY POVERTY

02:32:08.486 --> 02:32:11.222
SITUATIONS THE OUTCOMES ARE

02:32:11.288 --> 02:32:15.960
REMARKABLE THEY IN FACT ACHIEVE

02:32:16.026 --> 02:32:19.663
AS MUCH OR GREATER THAN ALL OF

02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:21.765
THE OTHER STUDENTS IN CLOVIS

02:32:21.832 --> 02:32:24.468
UNIFIED THEY ARE TURNING INTO

02:32:24.535 --> 02:32:27.371
VALEDICTORIANS THEY ARE TURNING

02:32:27.438 --> 02:32:32.576
INTO LEADERS. NOW THEY MAY NOT

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:34.912
THE FORMULA SUGGESTS. BUT I

02:32:34.979 --> 02:32:37.915
SUGGEST TO YOU THEY IN FACT DO

02:32:37.982 --> 02:32:40.117
IT. AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY

02:32:40.184 --> 02:32:43.220
FACTOR HERE. IS WHAT HAPPENS

02:32:43.287 --> 02:32:45.523
WITH THE STUDENTS ARE THEY IN

02:32:45.589 --> 02:32:48.759
FACT LAUNCHING THEMSELVES INTO

02:32:48.826 --> 02:32:50.961
SUCCESS THE ANSWER TO THAT IS A

02:32:51.028 --> 02:32:53.731
REMAIN A RESOUNDING YES.

02:32:53.797 --> 02:32:56.066
SOMETIMES THE COMPLAINT ABOUT

02:32:56.133 --> 02:32:56.634
CLOVIS UNIFIED IS THAT THERE

02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:59.770
ARE A- SCHOOL DISTRICT- THAT IS

02:32:59.837 --> 02:33:04.275
AFFLUENT. THAT JUST DOES NOT

02:33:04.341 --> 02:33:06.076
SUGGEST THAT THOSE WHO

02:33:06.143 --> 02:33:08.546
CRITICIZE IT UNDERSTAND. THE

02:33:08.612 --> 02:33:10.114
REALITY THAT THERE ARE

02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:12.650
SIGNIFICANT KIDS IN PROPERTY

02:33:12.716 --> 02:33:14.018
AND SIGNIFICANT ENGLISH

02:33:14.084 --> 02:33:15.886
LANGUAGE LEARNERS THAT ARE IN

02:33:15.953 --> 02:33:18.155
CLOVIS UNIFIED AND THEIR

02:33:18.222 --> 02:33:21.559
ACHIEVEMENTS ARE REMARKABLE.

02:33:21.625 --> 02:33:23.661
AND I WANT TO ALSO SUGGEST WHEN

02:33:23.727 --> 02:33:27.464
STUDENTS. FAMILIES DECIDE TO

02:33:27.531 --> 02:33:30.868
MOVE FROM ONE. SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:33:30.935 --> 02:33:33.837
TO ANOTHER. BUT BECAUSE THE

02:33:33.904 --> 02:33:36.674
COMMUNITY HAS TALKED TO ONE

02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:40.144
ANOTHER ABOUT HOW WELL THEIR

02:33:40.210 --> 02:33:45.349
KIDS PERFORM. I UNDERSTAND THE

02:33:45.416 --> 02:33:47.685
BASIC NUMBERS ANALYSIS HERE AND

02:33:47.751 --> 02:33:51.088
I DO UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF

02:33:51.155 --> 02:33:54.592
THE MEMBER OF SPONSORING THIS.

02:33:54.658 --> 02:33:56.727
I DO WANT TO JUST REMIND US

02:33:56.794 --> 02:33:59.496
THAT THERE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:33:59.563 --> 02:34:01.799
AND CLOVIS IS ONE OF THEM. THAT

02:34:01.865 --> 02:34:04.268
HAS TAKEN THOSE FARMS AND HAS

02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:07.438
ACHIEVED REMARKABLE ADVANCE.

02:34:07.504 --> 02:34:09.273
PER CAPITA BETTER ADVANCEMENTS

02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:11.375
THAN ANY OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:34:11.442 --> 02:34:13.944
IN THE AREA AND IN FACT MOST

02:34:14.011 --> 02:34:17.414
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN THE STATE

02:34:17.481 --> 02:34:19.783
OF CALIFORNIA YES THEY DO IT

02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:23.354
DIFFERENTLY YES THEY DO IT WITH

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:25.990
MENTORS AND WITH- OF FAMILIES

02:34:26.056 --> 02:34:30.127
AND WITH THE STUDENT HELD BY A-

02:34:30.194 --> 02:34:33.664
AND SO I'M GONNA LAY OFF. BUT

02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:38.135
WE MAKE A MISTAKE IF ALL WE DO

02:34:38.202 --> 02:34:40.738
IS LOOK AT NUMBERS AND WE DON'T

02:34:40.804 --> 02:34:44.074
LOOK AT ACHIEVEMENT I'M HERE TO

02:34:44.141 --> 02:34:45.876
SUGGEST THAT ACHIEVEMENT CLOVIS

02:34:45.943 --> 02:34:48.045
IS WORTHY OF A THUMBS UP EVEN

02:34:48.112 --> 02:34:49.079

BELIEVE IS WHAT IS REAL IN THE

02:34:56.153 --> 02:34:57.554
CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND WHO HAVE

02:35:04.161 --> 02:35:06.063
FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE

02:35:06.130 --> 02:35:07.731

COLLEAGUES HERE- AND KEEP IN

02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:32.322
MIND THAT THIS IS NOT OF THIS

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:33.524
IS NOT AN ATTACK ON ANY

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:34.858
PARTICULAR DISTRICT THIS WAS

02:35:34.925 --> 02:35:36.627
RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE AND THEY

02:35:36.694 --> 02:35:38.295
BRANDON LEE CHOSE CERTAIN

02:35:38.362 --> 02:35:40.531
DISTRICTS TO LOOK AT OF THEIR

02:35:40.597 --> 02:35:41.131
KNOWLEDGE IN THE REPORT THAT

02:35:41.198 --> 02:35:43.400
THERE WERE SEVERAL. DISTRICTS

02:35:43.467 --> 02:35:44.802
WOULD DO USING THE A MONEY

02:35:44.868 --> 02:35:46.370
APPROPRIATELY NICOLE WAS MAY

02:35:46.437 --> 02:35:47.371
HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE SO IT'S

02:35:47.438 --> 02:35:48.639
NOT REALLY AN ATTACK ON CALL

02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:49.673
WAS THEY WERE JUST THE ONES

02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:51.308
THAT WOULD CHOSEN TO LOOK AT

02:35:51.375 --> 02:35:52.643
THEY LOOK AT MY DISTRICT SAN

02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:54.645
DIEGO AND- THEY SAW SOME GOOD

02:35:54.712 --> 02:35:55.746
THINGS HAPPENING I SAW SOME

02:35:55.813 --> 02:35:56.880
THINGS THAT WERE CHALLENGING

02:35:56.947 --> 02:35:58.882
THAT WERE HAPPENING THE KEY IS

02:35:58.949 --> 02:36:00.451
THAT WE HAVE AS A LEGISLATURE

02:36:00.517 --> 02:36:06.190

WE SAY WHAT IS MY TO FOR. THAT

02:36:08.659 --> 02:36:10.394
BUT- PERSON IS NOT FORCE. NOT A

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:10.994
PENSION FOR. NOT FOR ANY OF

02:36:11.061 --> 02:36:11.729
OTHER THING BUT IT SHOULD FOR

02:36:11.795 --> 02:36:12.763
THAT. THEN WE LOOK TO SEE

02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:14.431
WHETHER NOW AS AN OVERALL.

02:36:14.498 --> 02:36:15.532
STATE ARE WE DOING THAT AND

02:36:15.599 --> 02:36:17.701
THEY LOOK AT SPECIFIC. TO SEE

02:36:17.768 --> 02:36:18.936
HOW THEY MANAGING THE MONEY.

02:36:19.002 --> 02:36:20.137
AND WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT THERE

02:36:20.204 --> 02:36:22.206
WAS NO REAL INTENT TO BASICALLY

02:36:22.272 --> 02:36:24.007
IN SOME CASES TO FOCUS ON THE

02:36:24.074 --> 02:36:24.908
MONEY ON THE KIDS THAT WERE

02:36:24.975 --> 02:36:26.744
MOST IN NEED- AND THEN MONEY

WAS BEING HELD OVER FOR THE

02:36:28.645 --> 02:36:30.013

THE GENERAL BUDGET FOR WHATEVER

02:36:31.014 --> 02:36:32.249
THEY NEEDED IT. AND THAT

02:36:32.316 --> 02:36:33.050
DOESN'T MEAN THE DISTRICTS

02:36:33.117 --> 02:36:34.351
DON'T NEED DOLLARS THAT THEY

02:36:34.418 --> 02:36:35.252
DON'T NEED THE RESOURCES THAT

02:36:35.319 --> 02:36:36.687

02:36:36.754 --> 02:36:37.621
SAY IS THAT WHEN WE'RE

02:36:37.688 --> 02:36:39.189

02:36:40.924 --> 02:36:42.493
THAT MY GOES THERE. THAT IT

02:36:42.559 --> 02:36:43.393
DOESN'T GET SHIFTED AROUND. AND

02:36:43.460 --> 02:36:45.395
WHAT HAPPENED IS EVEN. UNDER

WE MIGHT NEED THAT MONEY. AND

02:36:49.099 --> 02:36:50.834
MY ARGUMENT CONTINUE TO SAY

02:36:50.901 --> 02:36:51.535
WHAT WOULD IN THAT PARTICULAR

02:36:51.602 --> 02:36:53.170

MONEY WE DIDN'T USE IT ON THOSE

02:36:54.705 --> 02:36:56.406
