01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.111
BEING SWEPT BACK INTO THE

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.213
BUDGET SO WE IN ADDITION TO

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:59.148
THOSE SEVENTEEN ELLIE GAYS THAT

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.349
WERE INTERESTED IN APPLYING

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:02.118
FOR THESE FUNDS HI WE BELIEVE

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.387
THERE WERE MORE -- EVALUATIONS

01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:05.855
BY WEST ED IN THE LEARNING

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.757
POLICY INSTITUTE REPORTS

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:09.492
ARE -- ARE HIGHLIGHTING THE

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:10.926
SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.361
GETTING TESTIMONIALS FROM THE

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:13.662
DISTRICTS THAT ARE OPERATING

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.264
THEM THERE'S MORE AND MORE

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:17.166
GOOD NEWS EMERGING FROM THIS

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.168
INVESTMENT IN THIS DEVELOPMENT

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:20.803
I AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.438
IS GOING TO BE COMPELLING FOR

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:23.639
OTHER DISTRICTS THAT WOULD

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.474
LIKE TO GET ON BOARD WITH THIS

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:29.145
WORK MMHM SO THE THE ONE OF

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.212
THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WAS

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.680
RAISED IN THE AGENDA HAD TO DO

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:32.915

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.552
FACT THERE ARE HELPFUL BUT A

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:37.820
PARTICULARLY IF THEY COULD BE

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:40.189
EXPENDED OVER SEVERAL YEARS ARE

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:41.624
WE DO BELIEVE THAT CONTINUOUS

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.459
FUNDING IS NECESSARY IF WE

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:44.960

AT THE START OF BUT THAT'S

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:57.940
BECAUSE THEY'RE DEVELOPING

PRODUCING AND AND AND RELEASING

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:16.885

SPECIFICATIONS ESTABLISHED

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:21.123
BY THE LEGISLATURE ALSO WHERE

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.192
THERE WERE PARAMETERS OF

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:24.993
REQUIRED FOR ELIGIBILITY WE

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:25.994
ADDRESS THOSE IN THE R.

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:28.030
F. P. I THINK THE LEGISLATIVE

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:31.033
ANALYST'S REPORT IS IS ACCURATE

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:32.434
THAT THAT MAY NOT HAVE GONE TO

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:35.671
THE HIGHEST NEED OR THE -- THE

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:38.040
LOWEST INCOME I DISTRICTS IN

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:39.842
THE STATE THAT CERTAINLY IS AN

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.476
ADAPTATION TO THE PROGRAM THAT

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:43.278
THAT WE COULD CREATE AS WELL

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:45.848
AS ONE OF THE PRIORITIES OF

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.216
I THINK EXPANDING THESE FUNDS

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:49.952
FULLY -- USE WOULD BE A GOAL

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.987
ON ANNUALLY AND AND WE WOULD

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:53.689
RECOMMEND THAT IF IF PARAMETERS

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:56.491
ARE INCLUDED OF LIKE THESE

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.393
THAT HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED THAT

01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.962
THEY BE A LIST OF PRIORITIES

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:02.431
SO THAT WE DON'T HIT -- A BLOCK

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:03.532
WHERE WE CAN'T RELEASE ALL OF

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:04.833
THE FUNDS BECAUSE THEY THEY

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.301
CAN'T BE ABSORBED BY A SMALLER

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:08.403
GROUP OF OF THE L.

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:11.273

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.395
TAKE A LOOK AT POTENTIALLY

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:34.463

DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LANGUAGE

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.296

KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.608
AN EFFECTIVE USE OF MONEY IF

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:20.942
WE DON'T REALLY BE SPECIFIC

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:22.143
ON WHAT WHAT THE USE OF THOSE

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:25.113

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.314
BECAUSE WE WE SHOULD PROBABLY

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:28.250
GOING TO IS SOME KIDS ARE US

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:29.251

CREDENTIALED CANDIDATES COME

01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:41.423

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.381
AM WE HAVE BEEN HEARING

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:23.051
ANECDOTALLY THAT EDUCATORS

THE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:45.440
CHANGES OTHER THAN THE TOPIC

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:47.709
AREAS THAT THE MONEY CAN BE

01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:49.711
SPENT ON TYPES OF PROFESSIONAL

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.212
DEVELOPMENT OR PROFESSIONAL

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:54.382
LEARNING WELL IT THE GREAT

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:55.850
THING ABOUT THIS FUNDING IS IT

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:58.553
ALLOWS EACH LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:02.390
AGENCY TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:04.092
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.693
THEIR EDUCATORS LOOKING FOR

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.962
THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY CAN

01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:10.632
USE THESE FUNDS TO SUPPLEMENT

01:26:10.698 --> 01:26:12.133
THEIR FUNDS THEY CAN USE OTHER

FUNDS TO SUPPLEMENT THESE

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:16.471
FUNDS I'M IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:17.572
AND WE FOUND THAT IN THE

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:19.574
TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN PROGRAM

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:21.576
BASED ON REPORTS FROM THE

01:26:21.643 --> 01:26:23.511
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:25.413
EDUCATORS ARE TEACHING ABOUT

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.448

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.551
APPLYING MORE FUNDING TO THE

PROVIDED THEM TO SUPPLEMENT THE

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:36.057
EFFECTIVE EDUCATOR BOKER OUT

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:38.159
SOME DO THINK THAT THIS IS A

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:40.295
FANTASTIC WAY TO PROVIDE MONEY

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:42.630
THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:43.898
TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:49.437
DEVELOPMENT TO THEIR EDUCATORS

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:50.638
OKAY THE L. A. L.

01:26:54.309 --> 01:26:56.711
APPROPRIATIONS COMPARED TO WHAT

01:26:56.778 --> 01:26:59.747
WE DID SEVEN YEARS AGO AND AND

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:01.983
WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD --

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.318
TAKE A LOOK AT THE JUSTANSWER

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:04.752
TIGHTENING THE LANGUAGE FOR

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:07.522

WAS A REASONABLE APPROACH

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:20.034
-- THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:21.135
FLEXIBILITY THAT'S GIVEN TO

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:22.570
DISTRICTS OVER HOW TO USE THESE

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:24.606
FUNDS AND WHAT TOPICS TO CHOOSE

WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE REST OF

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:25.292
THE COMMUNITY TO SEE IT BEING A

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:26.793
MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.929
AND CARE AND ITS BROAD VISION

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.931
FOR -- KIND OF A TEN YEAR GOAL

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:32.899
FOR RICIN FOR HOW WE KIND OF

01:44:32.966 --> 01:44:35.402
COULDN'T REORGANIZE THE WHOLE

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:36.870
SET OF SERVICES AND SYSTEMS

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:39.673
AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE UNDER WAY

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.642
IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SPACE

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:43.276
SO WITH ALL THAT IN MIND THE

01:44:43.343 --> 01:44:45.145
COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING --

01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:46.480
WE'VE HAD A DESIGN TEAM THAT

01:44:46.546 --> 01:44:47.714
WORKED WITH US FOR A COUPLE

01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:49.016
OF YEARS ON HOW SHOULD WE

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:50.417
STRUCTURE PREPARATION FOR THE

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:52.152
WORK FORCE WE'VE BEEN WAITING

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:54.021
FOR THIS MASTER PLAN AND THAT

01:44:54.087 --> 01:44:55.689
THAT CHANCE TO GAUGE WHERE

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:57.691
PUBLIC OPINION IS ABOUT HOW WE

01:44:57.758 --> 01:45:00.093
SHOULD -- SET REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.729
WORK IN EARLY -- THE PRESCHOOL

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:04.898
NTK WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:06.233
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:07.868
AS THEY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING

01:45:07.934 --> 01:45:09.036
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:10.604
REGULATIONS AROUND THE T.

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:12.572
K. PORTION IN PARTICULAR

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:14.107
AND REALLY WHAT WE WOULD

01:45:14.174 --> 01:45:16.009
LIKE TO DO AND AND WE THESE

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:17.210
CONVERSATIONS RELATING FOR

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:18.945
THAT IS WORK COLLABORATIVELY

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:20.380
TO MAKE THIS A MORE SEAMLESS

01:45:20.447 --> 01:45:23.750
PROCESS OF PREPARATION FOR

01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:24.885
TEACHERS WORKING IN THE

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:26.253
PRESCHOOL SPACE THE T.

01:45:26.319 --> 01:45:28.455
K. SPACE IN THE EARLY EARLY

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:31.658
GRADES -- SO WE HAVE SOME IDEAS

01:45:31.725 --> 01:45:33.126
ON THE TABLE WHERE WE TAKE THE

01:45:33.193 --> 01:45:35.062
MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL

01:45:35.128 --> 01:45:37.831
AND -- EXPAND ITS END AND

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:40.033
STRENGTHEN IT FOR ITS -- ITS

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.702
ABILITY TO WORK WITH AN EARLY

01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:43.704
LEARNING AND CARE ENVIRONMENT

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:44.971
AND TO TAKE THE EXISTING

01:45:45.038 --> 01:45:46.740
CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT AND

01:45:46.807 --> 01:45:48.075
STRENGTHEN IT SO THAT THERE

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:50.177
IS A PATHWAY AND AND POSSIBLY

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:52.713
EVEN A NICE BRIDGE TO MOVE

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:54.481
FROM ONE TO THE OTHER ALTHOUGH

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:55.982
THESE ARE BIG IDEAS IT AND

01:45:56.049 --> 01:45:57.551
IT'S IT'S A DEVELOPMENT SO IT'S

01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:59.953
NOT NECESSARILY ATK CREDENTIAL

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:01.555
IT'S THAT EARLY IT'S EARLY

01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:02.923
GREAT SO LIKE A P.

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:05.492
THREE THREE CREDENTIAL HOW

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:06.760
THE DIFFERENT THE MULTIPLE

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:09.396
SUBJECT CREDENTIAL SO WE DON'T

01:46:09.463 --> 01:46:10.797
HAVE A P. A T. K.

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:12.165
THROUGH GRADE THREE CREDENTIAL

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:14.468
YET ON THE BOOKS NOT ONLY HAVE

01:46:14.534 --> 01:46:15.769
MEANT THAT THE IS THE IDEA

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:18.071
TO CREATE SIX NOT NECESSARILY

01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:20.107
TEEKAY CREDENTIAL BUT I CREEK

01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:21.675
AND I'M KIND OF PARALLEL

01:46:21.742 --> 01:46:23.577
CREDENTIAL FOR P.

01:46:23.643 --> 01:46:24.945
THROUGH THIRD GRADE P.

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:27.781
THREE THREE THAT IS ONE OF THE

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:29.449
IDEAS ON THE TABLE WE REALLY

01:46:29.516 --> 01:46:31.485
NEED TO GAUGE THE -- THE THE

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:33.186
LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:35.288
SUPPORT FOR THAT IDEA WE THINK

01:46:35.355 --> 01:46:37.591
GOOD A TKA THROUGH GRADE THREE

01:46:37.657 --> 01:46:39.426
CREDENTIAL COULD ADD A LOT TO

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:42.195
OUR SYSTEM -- AND THE MULTIPLE

01:46:42.262 --> 01:46:43.630
SUBJECT CREDENTIAL YOU KNOW

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:46.133
ALREADY TO WORK IN TKA REQUIRES

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:48.301
THAT THAT TEACHERS HAVE SOME

01:46:48.368 --> 01:46:50.537
PREPARATION IN EARLY -- CHILD

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:53.173
CARE AND EDUCATION BUT AGAIN

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:54.808
WE WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THAT

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:56.309
WE ARE ALL WE ARE AT THE EDGE

01:46:56.376 --> 01:46:57.677
HERE OF BEING ABLE TO REALLY

01:46:57.744 --> 01:46:59.780
DIG IN AND AND LOOK AT WAYS

01:46:59.846 --> 01:47:01.481
TO STRENGTHEN THE OTHER AT A

01:47:01.548 --> 01:47:03.717
PRESCHOOL THROUGH GRADE THREE

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:06.319
PRUDENTIAL COULD HELP WOULD

01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:08.054
REPLACE THE MULTIPLE SUBJECTS

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:10.190
PROVINCIAL LIKELY NOT I IN

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.224
TERMS OF WORKING T.

01:47:11.291 --> 01:47:12.726
K. THROUGH GRADE THREE BUT WHAT

01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:14.561
IT NEED TO ALIGN TO THAT AND

01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:16.229
AND ALLOW A STEP MULTIPLE WAYS

01:47:16.296 --> 01:47:17.697
TO ASSIGN TEACHERS TO THESE

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:19.533
-- THESE TYPES OF LEARNING

01:47:19.599 --> 01:47:20.667
ENVIRONMENTS THAT WOULD

01:47:20.734 --> 01:47:23.270
PROBABLY BE ABLE OKAY THANK

01:47:23.336 --> 01:47:26.473
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY ADONIS

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.141
YES TO KIND OF DIG INTO THIS --

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:30.210
TOPIC A LITTLE FURTHER YOU KNOW

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:32.112
THE EARLY LEARNING COMMUNITY

01:47:32.179 --> 01:47:34.347
-- AND EARLY LEARNING PROVIDERS

01:47:34.414 --> 01:47:36.116
PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS ON FOR

01:47:36.183 --> 01:47:37.617
DECADES NOW HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:47:37.684 --> 01:47:39.753
TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF I'M

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:42.422
NOT JUST CARE BUT TEACHERS AND

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:43.557
THERE ARE TEACHERS MORE AND

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:44.658
MORE TEACHERS AT A PRESCHOOL

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:45.725
TEACHERS HAVE A BACHELOR'S

01:47:45.792 --> 01:47:47.527
DEGREES SOME ONLY HAVE A

01:47:47.594 --> 01:47:50.130
SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF UNITS OR --

01:47:50.197 --> 01:47:51.731
ED EARLY LEARNING THEIR CHILD

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:54.234
CARE PERMITS -- SO I THINK

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.937
THAT WE DO NEED TO CONSIDER

01:47:57.003 --> 01:47:59.005
-- THE EXISTING WORK FORCE AS

01:47:59.072 --> 01:48:01.474
A PIPELINE AND THIS PIPELINE

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:02.843
A I DON'T I WOULDN'T WANT TO

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:04.244
DECIMATED BECAUSE OF SEEING

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:06.213
A STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS SO

01:48:06.279 --> 01:48:08.481
I'M DEFINITELY OPEN TO TALKING

01:48:08.548 --> 01:48:10.450
ABOUT WHAT A -- P.

01:48:10.517 --> 01:48:12.319
THREE THREE OR PRESCHOOL T.

01:48:12.385 --> 01:48:13.987
K. CREDENTIALING PROCESS COULD

01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:15.689
LOOK LIKE WELL KEEPING IN MIND

01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:17.290
THAT THERE IS AN EXISTING WORK

01:48:17.357 --> 01:48:19.492
FORCE -- THAT HAS WORKED HARD

01:48:19.559 --> 01:48:21.228
TO IMPROVE QUALITY SO I JUST

01:48:21.294 --> 01:48:22.729
WANT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT

01:48:22.796 --> 01:48:24.231
THERE AND WOULD LOVE YOU KNOW

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:26.766
ANY ADDITIONAL UNDERSTANDING

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:28.869
OF WHAT FLEXIBILITIES WE COULD

01:48:28.935 --> 01:48:31.004
GIVE TO THE EXISTING WORK FORCE

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:33.206
TO GET THEM TO A PLACE WHERE

01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:34.241
THEY COULD BE T. K.

01:48:34.307 --> 01:48:35.842
TEACHERS SOONER RATHER THAN

01:48:35.909 --> 01:48:38.545
LATER -- EIGHT N.

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:40.513
AND BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:44.918
THE COST MAY MAYBE TO THAT

01:48:44.985 --> 01:48:47.821
WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WITH

01:48:47.888 --> 01:48:49.289
THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING --

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:51.791
AND YOU KNOW THIS IS WE WE'VE

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:53.093
WE'RE GOOD BUT WE'RE RIGHT AT

01:48:53.159 --> 01:48:54.561
THE EDGE NOW WITH THE MASTER

01:48:54.628 --> 01:48:57.197
PLAN PROVIDING A BROAD CONTEXT

01:48:57.264 --> 01:48:58.798
AND REYES AND WE'RE I THINK

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.000
WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT

01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:01.534
NOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:03.703
WORK TOGETHER -- TYPICALLY

01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:05.405
THIS IS A TECHNICAL QUALITY OF

01:49:05.472 --> 01:49:06.907
CREDENTIALING IN CALIFORNIA BUT

01:49:06.973 --> 01:49:08.408
ONCE SOMEBODY IS CREDENTIALED

01:49:08.475 --> 01:49:10.443
TO DO SOMETHING WE DON'T TAKE

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:12.178
THAT CREDENTIAL AWAY SO ANY

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:15.382
CHANGES WE MAKE GOING FORWARD

01:49:15.448 --> 01:49:16.816
IN PREPARATION OF LICENSURE

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:18.418
FOR THIS COMMUNITY WILL NOT

01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:20.887
REMOVE THEIR THE ABILITY OF THE

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:22.455
EXISTING WORKFORCE TO CONTINUE

01:49:22.522 --> 01:49:23.690
PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:25.592
THEY'RE PROVIDING BUT AS WE

01:49:25.659 --> 01:49:27.193
ARE DEVELOPING SYSTEMS THAT

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.296
ARE INTERNET STANDARDS FOR

01:49:29.362 --> 01:49:30.530
PREPARATION AND WORKING WITH

01:49:30.597 --> 01:49:32.032
PREPARATION PROGRAMS IN THE

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:33.233
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND FOUR

01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.402
YEAR INSTITUTIONS TO STRENGTHEN

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:36.970
AND BRING SOME CONSISTENCY

01:49:37.037 --> 01:49:39.272
AND AND SYSTEMATIC ORDER TO

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:41.007
THE PREPARATION IS WORKFORCE

01:49:41.074 --> 01:49:41.975
WE THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

01:49:42.042 --> 01:49:43.243
BE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES

01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:44.544
TO INVEST IN PROFESSIONAL

01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:46.413
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE EXISTING

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:48.181
WORKFORCE AND TO CREATE ON

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:49.950
RAMPS FOR THIS WORK FORCE

01:49:50.016 --> 01:49:52.485
TO MOVE INTO A DEEPER INTO

01:49:52.552 --> 01:49:54.321
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PRE K.

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:56.256
THROUGH GRADE THREE SPACE

01:49:56.323 --> 01:49:57.290
WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE

01:49:57.357 --> 01:49:58.892
CLASSIFIED GRANT PROGRAM

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:00.427
POSSIBLY BEING ADAPTED FOR THIS

01:50:00.493 --> 01:50:02.062
PURPOSE OF BRITISH POPULATION

01:50:02.128 --> 01:50:03.430
WE THINK THAT'S A FIRST A

01:50:03.496 --> 01:50:06.466
GOOD IDEA -- AND SO IT'S BUT

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:07.500
ALL OF THIS OF THE MOMENT

01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:09.302
IS REALLY IN THE CONCEPTUAL

01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:11.104
STAGE I WILL BE GETTING

01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:13.540
SOME WORK -- ON AS I SAID ON

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:14.841
STANDARDS AND AND LOOKING AT

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.109
HOW TO STRENGTHEN PREPARATION

01:50:16.176 --> 01:50:17.711
PROGRAMS WE'RE BUILDING A

01:50:17.777 --> 01:50:19.179
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT FOR

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:20.480
PRESCHOOL THROUGH T.

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:23.016
K. TEACHERS ARE ADDED AND

01:50:23.083 --> 01:50:24.451
THAT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT

01:50:24.517 --> 01:50:25.852
WILL BECOME A TOOL THAT CAN BE

01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:27.487
USED TO STRENGTHEN PREPARATION

01:50:27.554 --> 01:50:29.289
AND DIAGNOSTICALLY TO ASSESS

01:50:29.356 --> 01:50:30.190
THE NEEDS OF THE EXISTING

01:50:30.256 --> 01:50:31.825
WORKFORCE SO WE CAN FOCUS

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:35.061
INVESTMENTS AND AND REYES SAID

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:36.997
THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE WHOLE

01:50:37.063 --> 01:50:38.932
OF THE WHOLE POPULATION SO A

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:40.500
LOT OF IDEAS AND PROGRAMS --

01:50:40.567 --> 01:50:41.735
UNDER WAY WE DON'T WANT TO

01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:43.570
DISENFRANCHISE THE EXISTING

01:50:43.636 --> 01:50:45.672
WORKFORCE AS WE DO THIS SO

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:48.141
ATTENDING TO TRANSITIONS --

01:50:48.208 --> 01:50:50.410
BETTER TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:52.112
AND WELL SUPPORTED WILL BE A

01:50:52.178 --> 01:50:53.279
CRITICAL PART OF WHAT WE DO

01:50:53.346 --> 01:50:55.682
NEXT AND ONE MORE QUESTION IF

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:56.716
YOU WILL I'M JUST TO KIND OF

01:50:56.783 --> 01:50:59.486
BROADEN THEM THE THAT TOPIC

01:50:59.552 --> 01:51:00.920
HERE THE PROPOSED TRAILER

01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:02.155
BILL LANGUAGE MAKES NUMEROUS

01:51:02.222 --> 01:51:03.523
CHANGES TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:04.891
FOR INDIVIDUALS WORKING TOWARDS

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:06.493
A TEACHING CREDENTIAL TO

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:07.827
DEMONSTRATE BASIC SKILLS AND

01:51:07.894 --> 01:51:09.896
SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCY I'M

01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:11.898
CAN THE CTC COMMENT ON SOME

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:13.533
OF THE POTENTIAL BARRIERS TO

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.468
ENTRY FOR TEACHER CANDIDATES

01:51:15.535 --> 01:51:16.603
THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:17.771
IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS

01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:18.972
AND HOW WILL THESE CHANGES

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:20.807
IMPACT THE CAREER PATHWAY FOR

01:51:20.874 --> 01:51:21.975
AN INDIVIDUAL INTERESTED IN

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:24.844
BECOMING A CREDENTIALED TEACHER

01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:26.212
WELL WE APPRECIATE VERY

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:27.480
MUCH THE PROPOSALS AND THE

01:51:27.547 --> 01:51:28.948
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE FIRST

01:51:29.015 --> 01:51:30.750
HAS TO DO WITH THE BASIC SKILLS

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:32.318
REQUIREMENT EVERY TEACHER NEEDS

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:33.453
TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR BASIC

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.688
SKILLS COMPETENCE MOST TEACHERS

01:51:35.755 --> 01:51:37.323
ARE TAKING THE CALIFORNIA BASIC

01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:38.758
EDUCATIONAL SKILLS TEST THE C.

01:51:38.825 --> 01:51:41.861
BEST -- AND WE FOUND OF

01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:43.463
SIGNIFICANT BERRIER THIS YEAR

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:44.564
WHEN TESTING CENTERS WERE

01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:45.899
CLOSED AND PEOPLE COULD NOT

01:51:45.965 --> 01:51:47.700
GOING TO TAKE THOSE TESTS

01:51:47.767 --> 01:51:49.235
SO FOR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:50.737
ALTERNATIVES TO THE TEST

01:51:50.804 --> 01:51:52.906
ITSELF TO BEAT THIS REQUIREMENT

01:51:52.972 --> 01:51:55.275
INCLUDING SCORES ON THE

01:51:55.341 --> 01:51:58.845
SAT OR THE ACT -- AND OTHER

01:51:58.912 --> 01:52:00.113
MEASURES THAT THE LEGISLATURES

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:01.981
ADOPTED OVER THE YEARS THE

01:52:02.048 --> 01:52:03.616
PROPOSAL THIS YEAR IS TO

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:05.251
ALLOW RATES OF THE B.

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:07.287
OR BETTER AN UNDERGRADUATE

01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:08.655
UNDERGRADUATE COURSEWORK

01:52:08.721 --> 01:52:10.557
FOCUSED ON READING WRITING

01:52:10.623 --> 01:52:12.959
AND MATHEMATICS TO COUNT

01:52:13.026 --> 01:52:15.028
-- AND THAT WE THINK WILL

01:52:15.095 --> 01:52:16.629
RIGHT SIZE IN SOME WAYS THIS

01:52:16.696 --> 01:52:17.931
REQUIREMENT WHERE TESTERS

01:52:17.997 --> 01:52:20.467
KEPT PEOPLE OUT OF -- OUT

01:52:20.533 --> 01:52:22.735
OF PREPARATION ALLOWING

01:52:22.802 --> 01:52:24.237
CONFIDENCE DEMONSTRATED

01:52:24.304 --> 01:52:25.105
IN YOUR UNDERGRADUATE

01:52:25.171 --> 01:52:26.539
COURSEWORK AT A GRADE OF B.

01:52:26.606 --> 01:52:29.142
OR BETTER OF ME IS THAT YOU'VE

01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:30.543
GOT BASIC ROLES THIS IS BECAUSE

01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:31.478
COMPETENCE AND YOU SHOULD BE

01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:32.879
MOVING FORWARD INTO TEACHER

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:33.880
PREPARATION IF THAT'S YOUR

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:36.082
GOAL OF PARALLEL TO THAT IS

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:37.550
THE SUBJECT MATTER REQUIREMENT

01:52:37.617 --> 01:52:38.585
WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE

01:52:38.651 --> 01:52:40.353
CALIFORNIA SUBJECT EXAMINATIONS

01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:41.387
FOR TEACHERS THE C.

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:44.424
SET OF WHICH MEASURES ACT OF

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:46.025
POTENTIAL TEACHERS SUBJECT

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:47.794
MATTER COMPETENCE THE LAW

01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:49.229
CURRENTLY ALLOWS THEM TO

01:52:49.295 --> 01:52:51.131
COMPLETE A FULL PROGRAM OF

01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:53.666
PREPARATION IN THAT SUBJECT

01:52:53.733 --> 01:52:54.834
MATTER AS AN ALTERNATIVE

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:56.936
TO THE TEST WITH THIS OF

01:52:57.003 --> 01:52:58.905
PROPOSAL WOULD DO IS ALLOW

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:00.473
FOR THE MIXING AND MATCHING

01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:02.609
UP TESTS INCLUDES FORCE WORK

01:53:02.675 --> 01:53:04.110
SO IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T PASS A

01:53:04.177 --> 01:53:05.378
PARTICULAR SUB TEST THEY WOULD

01:53:05.445 --> 01:53:07.614
BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT UP BY

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.549
TAKING A COURSE IT WOULD ALSO

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:11.151
ALLOW PREPARATION PROGRAMS

01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:13.153
TO EVALUATE TRANSCRIPTS TO

01:53:13.219 --> 01:53:14.621
DETERMINE WHETHER COURSE WORK

01:53:14.687 --> 01:53:16.623
HAS BEEN TAKEN THAT ADDRESSES

01:53:16.689 --> 01:53:18.391
THE MAJOR DOMAINS OF THE

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:19.592
SUBJECT MATTER AREA TO BE

01:53:19.659 --> 01:53:21.661
TAUGHT SO THE POSTER CHILD

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:23.096
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MIGHT

01:53:23.163 --> 01:53:24.430
BE A MATHEMATICS MAJOR WHO

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:25.899
WOULD LIKE TO BE A TEACHER

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:27.433
OF MATHEMATICS THE QUESTION

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:28.468
IS SHOULD THEY HAVE TO GO

01:53:28.535 --> 01:53:29.369
BACK AND TAKE A C.

01:53:29.435 --> 01:53:31.070
SET TEST OR COULD WE

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:32.472
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOMEONE WITH

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:34.807
A MATH DEGREE HAS MET AND

01:53:34.874 --> 01:53:36.776
EXCEEDED THE STANDARD AND JUST

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:38.778
LET THE MOVING TO TEACHING THIS

01:53:38.845 --> 01:53:40.813
HAVE BEEN MONOLITHIC ROADBLOCKS

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:43.016
FOR PEOPLE -- THAT THAT ONCE

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:44.417
YOU CAN'T GET PAST THAT THEN

01:53:44.484 --> 01:53:46.252
WE'RE LOSING PEOPLE WHO MIGHT

01:53:46.319 --> 01:53:47.387
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:49.355
THIS IN SOME OTHER WAY AND

01:53:49.422 --> 01:53:50.890
THAT IT AND AND WE ARE NOT

01:53:50.957 --> 01:53:52.525
IN ANY WAY SEEKING TO REDUCE

01:53:52.592 --> 01:53:54.561
THE RIGOR OR UNDERVALUE THE

01:53:54.627 --> 01:53:55.728
IMPORTANCE OF SUBJECT MATTER

01:53:55.795 --> 01:53:57.497
KNOWLEDGE OF BASIC SKILLS BUT

BESTIVAL IT SHOULD PLAY IT

01:54:08.908 --> 01:54:10.043
SHOULD NOT PLAY THE KIND OF

01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:12.011
ROADBLOCK HE SAID SHOULD NOT

ISSUE THAT WE HAVE THOUGH IS

02:10:22.781 --> 02:10:25.250
THAT IN LEGISLATION -- AND THAT

02:10:30.155 --> 02:10:32.024
CALCULATION AND THE ALLOCATION

02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:34.126
AND LEGISLATION -- SO THAT

02:10:34.193 --> 02:10:36.361
WOULD NEED TO BE SOMETHING

02:10:36.428 --> 02:10:38.697
IN LEGISLATION -- POSSIBLY A

02:10:38.764 --> 02:10:41.033
POSITIVE CONSIDERATION THAT

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:43.502
MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE ADDED

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:44.670
AND JUST FOR MY BENEFIT WHAT

02:10:44.736 --> 02:10:45.971
LEGISLATION WOULD WOULD YOU

02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:48.006

02:10:48.073 --> 02:10:50.475

BECAUSE EVEN IF FOR OPERATING

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:57.649
ASSUMPTION WE HAVE LIMITED

02:10:57.716 --> 02:10:59.251
FUNDS WHICH OF COURSE ARE

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:01.553
PIE KEEPS GROWING FORTUNATELY

02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:03.188
FOR US WE KNOW THAT THERE IS

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:04.590
OBVIOUSLY TWICE THE AVAILABLE

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:06.792
TO THE DEMAND IS TWICE THE

02:11:06.858 --> 02:11:08.427
EXCEEDING OF FUNDS WE EVEN HAVE

02:11:08.493 --> 02:11:09.861

COLLEGE ALSO ABOUT -- AND WAS

02:13:37.209 --> 02:13:38.877
MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE

02:13:38.944 --> 02:13:40.045
THE FACT THAT THE STUDENTS

02:13:40.112 --> 02:13:42.481
THAT ARE EXPOSED TO TWO CITIES

02:13:42.547 --> 02:13:43.882

YOUR COLLEGE BUT THE ONE THAT

02:13:47.486 --> 02:13:48.954
I WAS MOST INTERESTED IN IS

02:13:53.158 --> 02:13:54.626
TO PURSUE A FOUR YEAR DEGREE

02:13:54.693 --> 02:13:57.295
AS THEIR PEERS THIS SEEMS A

02:13:57.362 --> 02:14:00.232
LITTLE UNLIKELY TO ME BUT CAN

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:04.069

APARTMENT EDUCATION IN THE

02:14:07.139 --> 02:14:08.306
STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC

02:14:08.373 --> 02:14:10.142
INSTRUCTION WE WOULD NOTE THAT

02:14:10.208 --> 02:14:12.244
NOT ALL CTE CAREER PATHWAYS ARE

02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:14.012
JUST ABOUT GOING TO THE CAREER

02:14:14.079 --> 02:14:15.080
THERE ARE MANY IN THE STEM

02:14:15.147 --> 02:14:16.181
FIELDS OR IN THE HEALTHCARE

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:18.016
FIELD THE END UP LEADING TO

02:14:18.083 --> 02:14:19.251
A FOUR YEAR DEGREE A TWO YEAR

02:14:19.317 --> 02:14:20.786
DEGREE OR EVEN HIGHER EDUCATION

02:14:20.852 --> 02:14:21.753
SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.822
PATHWAY AND INDUSTRY SECTOR

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:26.324
SO THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY

02:14:26.391 --> 02:14:28.293
-- UP FOR LEASING TO SIMPLY

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:29.861
GOING STRAIGHT TO CAREERS BUT

02:14:29.928 --> 02:14:32.097

VIA COLLEGE AS WELL I THANK

02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:37.269
YOU IT SO IT SEEMS THAT WHAT

02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:38.937
WHAT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT

02:14:39.004 --> 02:14:40.539
TO ME IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:14:40.605 --> 02:14:43.208
WE DON'T PIGEONHOLE A STUDENT

02:14:43.275 --> 02:14:44.242
AND TELL THEM THIS IS THE

02:14:44.309 --> 02:14:45.877
YOUR ONLY PATH YOU SHOULDN'T

02:14:45.944 --> 02:14:47.179
GO TO COLLEGE HERE YOU JUST

02:14:47.245 --> 02:14:49.614
GO GET A CAREER OR GO GET A

02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:51.616
PROFESSION BUT THE FACT THAT

02:14:51.683 --> 02:14:53.351
THEY CAN HAVE EVERYTHING THEY

02:14:53.418 --> 02:14:54.553
CAN TAKE THESE COURSES THEY

02:14:54.619 --> 02:14:58.223
CAN BEGIN TO TO ESPECIALLY WITH

02:14:58.290 --> 02:14:59.558
THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS

02:14:59.624 --> 02:15:00.625
OR YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO

02:15:00.692 --> 02:15:01.927
JOIN A UNION AND THEY'RE GOING

02:15:01.993 --> 02:15:05.363
TO GET GOOD PAYING GOOD PAYING

02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:07.466
WAGES BUT I THINK MAKING SURE

02:15:07.532 --> 02:15:09.100
THAT WE LET OUR STUDENTS KNOW

02:15:09.167 --> 02:15:11.736
THAT EVERY OPTION IS AVAILABLE

02:15:11.803 --> 02:15:14.739
TO THEM IT DAYS IT'S NOT THAT

02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:16.174
THEY ONLY QUALIFY FOR ONE OR

02:15:16.241 --> 02:15:17.509
ONLY QUALIFY FOR ANOTHER BUT

02:15:17.576 --> 02:15:20.612
THAT WE WE WANT THEM TO SUCCEED

02:24:51.616 --> 02:24:52.850
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO CONTROL

THE GROWTH OF THESE PROGRAMS

02:24:54.385 --> 02:24:55.520

MAYBE IT'S A PLACE WE CAN

02:25:43.468 --> 02:25:45.470
LAND IN THE END -- I THINK BUT

02:25:45.536 --> 02:25:46.671
PEOPLE NEED TO REALIZE WHAT'S

02:25:46.737 --> 02:25:47.638

ON THE CHARTER SCHOOL

FEDERAL JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS

02:29:13.978 --> 02:29:15.513
THAT TO ME SEEMS LIKE A

02:29:15.579 --> 02:29:16.981
REASONABLE WAY OF ENSURING

02:29:17.048 --> 02:29:19.450
THESE PROGRAMS NEED -- THE

02:29:19.517 --> 02:29:23.387
GOALS INTENDED -- BUT THE THE

THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

02:29:31.128 --> 02:29:33.664

REQUIREMENTS WHY ARE WE

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:39.704
PLANNING TO IMPOSE A FUNDING

02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:41.605
CAP BASED ON THE PROGRAMS

02:29:41.672 --> 02:29:43.674
THAT WERE IN PLACE BEFORE

02:29:43.741 --> 02:29:46.177
THE PANDEMIC YET IT LOOKS

02:29:46.243 --> 02:29:47.445
TO ME FROM WHAT WE'RE SEEING

02:29:47.511 --> 02:29:48.679
THAT ACTUALLY -- WE'RE SEEING

02:29:48.746 --> 02:29:53.050
MORE DROPOUTS IN HIGH SCHOOL

02:29:53.117 --> 02:29:55.219
-- AND THAT COULDN'T THAT'S

02:29:55.286 --> 02:29:56.754
LIKELY INCREASING DURING THIS

02:29:56.821 --> 02:29:58.823
TIME SHOULD WE HAVE SOME OF

02:29:58.889 --> 02:30:02.226
THESE PROGRAMS IN PLACE --

02:30:02.293 --> 02:30:03.461
AND AGAIN AS LONG AS THEY'RE

02:30:03.527 --> 02:30:05.229
ABIDING BY THE REQUIREMENTS

02:30:05.296 --> 02:30:10.468
WHY PUT A CAP ON THE

02:30:10.534 --> 02:30:11.202
WHAT'S THE AND WHAT THE

02:30:11.268 --> 02:30:14.105
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE

02:30:14.171 --> 02:30:15.539
PURPOSE OF THE GRANDFATHERING

02:30:15.606 --> 02:30:17.108
CLAUSE IS WE WANT TO LIMIT

02:30:17.174 --> 02:30:18.743
THE FISCAL IMPACT EXISTING

02:30:18.809 --> 02:30:20.478
ADULT PROGRAMS RECEIVING LCS

02:30:20.544 --> 02:30:22.380
FAST BUT IT'S ALSO OR INTENT

02:30:22.446 --> 02:30:23.381
TO ENSURE THAT K.

02:30:23.447 --> 02:30:24.782
TWELVE I'LL SEE IF FUNDING

02:30:24.849 --> 02:30:26.517
IS PRIORITIZE FOR SCHOOL AGE

02:30:26.584 --> 02:30:29.353
CHILDREN -- SO THIS IS REALLY

02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:30.654
TRYING TO CONTROL THE GROWTH

02:30:30.721 --> 02:30:32.289
OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE --

02:30:32.356 --> 02:30:34.325
SERVING A DOUBLE STEP RECKLESS

02:30:34.392 --> 02:30:37.495
FELL EDUCATION PROGRAM AND NOW

02:30:37.561 --> 02:30:38.562
SQUEEZING OUT THE L. C.

02:30:38.629 --> 02:30:39.997
ABOUT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE K.

02:30:40.064 --> 02:30:45.302
TWELVE SCHOOLS

02:30:45.369 --> 02:30:46.971
RIGHT AND I MEAN IN THIS WHEN

02:30:47.037 --> 02:30:48.205
I CALLED FROM LONG BEACH AND I

02:30:48.272 --> 02:30:50.541
AGREE ON MANY THINGS EDUCATION

02:30:50.608 --> 02:30:54.211
BUT I I DO DIVERGE FROM HIM ON

02:30:54.278 --> 02:30:55.613
THE ON THE ADULT EDUCATION I

02:30:55.679 --> 02:30:59.517
THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT -- AND

02:30:59.583 --> 02:31:00.684
YEAH WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:02.787
SPECULATION THAT YOU KNOW FOR

FUTURE NEED NEED THAT EDUCATION

02:31:13.798 --> 02:31:15.866
GET THAT THIS IS YOUNG ANOTHER

02:31:15.933 --> 02:31:17.635
PATHWAY I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

02:31:17.701 --> 02:31:21.338
IMPORTANT TO HAVE -- I MEAN

02:31:21.405 --> 02:31:24.108
ARE WE UNDULY LIMITING THAT

02:31:24.175 --> 02:31:26.243
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:31:26.310 --> 02:31:29.647
PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW OR WE

02:31:29.713 --> 02:31:30.981
HELLO I'M KIND OF CONFUSED ON

02:31:31.048 --> 02:31:32.082

02:31:32.149 --> 02:31:34.819
ARE WE NOT ALLOWED FOR THAT

02:31:34.885 --> 02:31:38.222
THAT QUESTION YEAH

02:31:38.289 --> 02:31:39.190
THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT OF

02:31:39.256 --> 02:31:42.259
FINANCE SO WE WE'VE BEEN

02:31:42.326 --> 02:31:45.095

GOING TOWARDS ADULTS HAS BEEN

02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:47.798
INCREASING IN THE TENS OF

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:50.434
MILLIONS EACH YEAR SO I THINK

02:31:50.501 --> 02:31:52.269
WE WE JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

02:31:52.336 --> 02:31:54.772
THAT -- WANT TO CONTROL FOR

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:56.173
THIS GROWTH BECAUSE WE DO

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:57.741

02:31:57.808 --> 02:32:02.112
LARGER BITE OUT OF LCF AFTER

02:32:12.756 --> 02:32:14.592
INTERESTING TOPIC THAT WE

02:32:14.658 --> 02:32:16.927
TRY TO TACKLE LAST YEAR

02:32:16.994 --> 02:32:18.662
DURING COVER NINETEEN AND

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:19.830
WE COULDN'T AND WE DID HEAR

02:32:19.897 --> 02:32:22.933
FROM SOME OF THESE -- ADULT

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:24.101
ED CHARTER SCHOOLS IN OUR

02:32:24.168 --> 02:32:25.035
DISTRICTS ARE DOING GREAT

02:32:25.102 --> 02:32:26.770
WORK ONE HERE IN OUR AREA MR

02:32:26.837 --> 02:32:28.372
GALLAGHER'S HIGHLANDS CHARTER

02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:30.508
WHICH IS SERVICE YEP AND THE

02:32:30.574 --> 02:32:31.642
PART BE YOUR PART DISTRICT

02:32:31.709 --> 02:32:34.778
IN MIND WHICH TAKES ADULTS --

02:32:34.845 --> 02:32:38.482
PREDOMINATELY -- YEAH EASTERN

02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:40.985
EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS LATINOS

02:32:41.051 --> 02:32:42.586
SOME AFRICAN AMERICANS WELL

FORMER INCARCERATED AND HAS

02:32:44.121 --> 02:32:46.690
A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS RECORD

02:32:46.757 --> 02:32:48.559
AND I THINK THEY WENT FROM

02:32:48.626 --> 02:32:50.060
THE LAST FIVE YEARS FROM THREE

02:32:50.127 --> 02:32:51.862
HUNDRED STUDENTS TO MAYBE THREE

02:32:51.929 --> 02:32:54.331
THOUSAND SO A MASSIVE INCREASE

02:32:54.398 --> 02:32:55.332
SO THEY'RE DOING GOOD COULD

02:32:55.399 --> 02:32:57.034
WORK BUT I THINK THE QUESTION

02:32:57.101 --> 02:32:59.069
THAT THAT WE'RE ASKING IS

02:32:59.136 --> 02:32:59.937

STUDENT MAYBE LIKE TWELVE

02:33:11.849 --> 02:33:12.883
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THOUSAND

02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:15.319
DOLLARS A STUDENT FOR LCS PATH

02:33:15.386 --> 02:33:16.754
CLASSIFYING THEM AS A FOURTH

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:17.821
GRADER AT TENTH GRADER A

02:33:17.888 --> 02:33:18.923
FIRST GRADER BASED UPON THEIR

02:33:18.989 --> 02:33:20.991
LANGUAGE SKILLS WE HAVE THIS

02:33:21.058 --> 02:33:22.560
TRADITIONAL ADULTS SCHOOLS AND

02:33:22.626 --> 02:33:24.328
MY DISTRICT IN YOUR DISTRICT

02:33:24.395 --> 02:33:27.231
IN YOUR DISTRICT WHICH SERVE

02:33:27.298 --> 02:33:29.633
THE SAME POPULATION SAME ADULTS

02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:31.936
AND ADULTS SCHOOLS BY NICHOLAS

02:33:32.002 --> 02:33:33.737
DISTRACT SOME TO WERE IN LONG

02:33:33.804 --> 02:33:36.006
BEACH SAC CITY SO FORTH AND

02:33:36.073 --> 02:33:37.608
THEY GET ABOUT HALF OF THAT

02:33:37.675 --> 02:33:39.910
MONEY OR LESS AND SO THESE

02:33:39.977 --> 02:33:42.279
THESE ADULT CHARTER SCHOOLS

02:33:42.346 --> 02:33:43.280
IF I WAS THEM I DO THE SAME

02:33:43.347 --> 02:33:45.182
THING IF THERE'S TWO WINDOWS

02:33:45.249 --> 02:33:45.883
AND YOU WANT TO SERVE AN

02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:47.184
ADULT IS THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD

02:33:47.251 --> 02:33:48.586
EARNING ENGLISH YOU CAN GET

02:33:48.652 --> 02:33:50.621
REIMBURSED FROM THE STATE FOR

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:52.423
FIVE THOUSAND STUDENT OVER HERE

02:33:52.489 --> 02:33:54.458
FOR FOURTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS

02:33:54.525 --> 02:33:55.459
WHY WOULD THEY GO TO THAT

02:33:55.526 --> 02:33:56.627
WINDOW THEY'RE GONNA GO TO THIS

02:33:56.694 --> 02:33:58.562
WINDOW AND SO WE'RE SEEING THIS

02:33:58.629 --> 02:34:00.564
INCREASE INCREASE SO IF YOU DID

02:34:00.631 --> 02:34:02.900
NOTHING THESE ADULT ED PROGRAMS

02:34:02.967 --> 02:34:03.867
WOULD GO OUT OF BUSINESS

02:34:03.934 --> 02:34:05.569
BECAUSE IT JUST HAPPENED THAT

02:34:05.636 --> 02:34:06.770
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO TO THE

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:09.073
WINDOW NUMBER TWO RIGHT AND SO

02:34:09.139 --> 02:34:10.240
I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

02:34:10.307 --> 02:34:12.076
NOT THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE

02:34:12.142 --> 02:34:14.511
BATHWATER TO RECOGNIZE THESE

02:34:14.578 --> 02:34:16.413
ADULT SCHOOLS BUT YOU KNOW

02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:18.749
HAVING THIS MASSIVE INCREASE

02:34:18.816 --> 02:34:20.618
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

02:34:20.684 --> 02:34:22.319
IT FAIR TO DO TRADITIONAL ADULT

02:34:22.386 --> 02:34:25.823
SCHOOLS AND IT CHIPS AWAY AT

02:34:25.889 --> 02:34:27.691
THE FUNDING FOR LCS FAST AND SO

02:34:27.758 --> 02:34:29.460
I THINK WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:34:29.526 --> 02:34:30.861
TO DO IS COME UP WITH A FAIR

02:34:30.928 --> 02:34:32.963
COMPROMISE SO IF YOU CAN JUST

02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:35.532
UNRAVELING IN CCD E.

02:34:35.599 --> 02:34:37.901

OF FINANCE WHAT'S ROUGHLY

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:43.040

REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRADITIONAL

02:34:45.109 --> 02:34:46.443
ADULT SCHOOLS THROUGH SKIP

02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:54.418

OF FINANCE ON THAT ONE

02:35:04.194 --> 02:35:08.432

02:35:22.813 --> 02:35:24.882
ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM --

02:35:24.948 --> 02:35:26.216
BUT FOR THOSE SPECIFIC NUMBERS

02:35:26.283 --> 02:35:27.584
WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT GET

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:29.553
BACK TO YOU YEAH AND AND HOW

TRUST WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE

02:36:35.018 --> 02:36:37.221
USING ONE OF THE AFFECT

02:36:37.287 --> 02:36:38.155

AMOUNT OF FUNDING UNDER MORE

02:36:40.357 --> 02:36:41.258

BACK FROM JUST ABOUT IT TOO

02:36:55.672 --> 02:36:57.441
DIFFICULT SOCIAL WHO THEN

02:36:57.508 --> 02:36:58.542
ALLOCATE THE FUNDS AMONG

02:36:58.609 --> 02:37:00.010
THE MEMBERS OF THE PREFERRED

02:37:00.077 --> 02:37:01.578
FUNDING MODEL NOT A GREAT

02:37:01.645 --> 02:37:03.413
LIFT THE GROWTH FUNDING IS

PROVIDED WITHIN THE BUDGET I'M

02:37:05.149 --> 02:37:06.683
IF NOT AUTOMATICALLY THAT IS A

02:37:06.750 --> 02:37:09.486
DIFFERENT YES SO THEY E.

02:37:09.553 --> 02:37:10.621
SOMEONE COULD GET BACK TO US

02:37:10.687 --> 02:37:12.089
WITH THE EXACT NUMBERS BUT

02:37:12.156 --> 02:37:13.090
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY SAYING

02:37:13.157 --> 02:37:14.458
THAT MY CHARACTER RACE AND

02:37:14.525 --> 02:37:16.960
CHARACTERIZATION IS IS FAIRLY

02:37:17.027 --> 02:37:18.629
ACCURATE AND I THINK THAT

02:37:18.695 --> 02:37:19.763
THE PROOF IS IN THE IN THE

02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:21.999
PUTTING HERE IS THAT -- A

02:37:22.065 --> 02:37:24.635
CHAR EDUCATION SHERM MAN FROM

02:37:24.701 --> 02:37:26.770
LONG BEACH SAYS DOESN'T GO FAR

02:37:26.837 --> 02:37:28.472
ENOUGH WE SHOULD GET RID OF ALL

02:37:28.539 --> 02:37:30.774
THIS AND WE DON'T HAVE SOME OF

02:37:30.841 --> 02:37:32.676
THE EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS

02:37:32.743 --> 02:37:34.411
YOU KNOW BANGING ON OUR DOOR

02:37:34.478 --> 02:37:36.146
RIGHT NOW THEY COULD BE LINING

02:37:36.213 --> 02:37:37.748
UP BUT WE'VE HEARD THAT THE

02:37:37.815 --> 02:37:39.183
MAJORITY OF THEM WE'RE STILL

02:37:39.249 --> 02:37:40.951
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT FIELD

02:37:41.018 --> 02:37:43.620
-- ARE SUPPORTIVE OF HAVING THE

02:37:43.687 --> 02:37:45.722
GRANDFATHER CLAUSE AND HAVING

02:37:45.789 --> 02:37:48.492
YOU KNOW BASICALLY STABILIZE

02:37:48.559 --> 02:37:49.927
THIS THIS THIS PROGRAM LET

02:37:49.993 --> 02:37:50.794
THE CURRENT ONES THAT ARE

02:37:50.861 --> 02:37:53.530
OPERATING AT STILL DO WELL --

02:37:53.597 --> 02:37:55.032
HAVING MORE REQUIREMENTS TO

02:37:55.098 --> 02:37:56.967
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:37:57.034 --> 02:37:59.102
LINKED UP WITH -- ENTITIES

02:37:59.169 --> 02:38:00.704
THAT PROVIDE ACTUALLY QUALITY

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:02.506
PROGRAMS AND MODELS THAT

02:38:02.573 --> 02:38:04.641
ACTUALLY WORK AND SO ON YEAH

02:38:04.708 --> 02:38:05.542
WE'RE GONNA KEEP WORKING ON

02:38:05.609 --> 02:38:07.477
THIS ISSUE BUT POTENTIALLY THIS

02:38:07.544 --> 02:38:09.880
IS A -- A DECENT -- COMPROMISE

02:38:09.947 --> 02:38:11.982
ASSEMBLYMEMBER VIDAK: SO MY

02:38:12.049 --> 02:38:14.518
QUESTION IS JUST IF IF WE'VE

02:38:14.585 --> 02:38:17.754
CLARIFIED THE RULES AND THE

02:38:17.821 --> 02:38:20.490
CHARGERS ARE ABIDING BY THE

02:38:20.557 --> 02:38:22.893
LAWS RULES THAT WE'VE CLARIFIED

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:29.366
WHY ARE WE GONNA CAPIT

02:38:29.433 --> 02:38:30.367
SAME WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:38:30.434 --> 02:38:33.770
FINANCE -- LOWER CLASS CLEARING

02:38:33.837 --> 02:38:35.339
THE RULES BECAUSE CURRENT

02:38:35.405 --> 02:38:37.875
LAW IS KIND OF VAGUE ON THE

02:38:37.941 --> 02:38:39.343
DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO

02:38:39.409 --> 02:38:41.311
BE EXCLUSIVELY IN PARTNERSHIP

02:38:41.378 --> 02:38:42.379
WE ALSO DON'T CURRENTLY

02:38:42.446 --> 02:38:44.414
COLLECT ANY INFORMATION BUT

02:38:44.481 --> 02:38:46.183
AT THE SAME TIME -- YOU KNOW

02:38:46.250 --> 02:38:47.584
WE WE ARE TRYING TO CONTROL

02:38:47.651 --> 02:38:48.852
THE GROWTH OF THESE PROGRAMS

02:38:48.919 --> 02:38:50.020
THAT ARE COMPETING WITH ADULT

02:38:50.087 --> 02:38:51.355
EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND THAT

02:38:51.421 --> 02:38:56.026
IS THE REASON FOR FOR THE CAP

02:38:56.093 --> 02:38:59.730
THANK YOU

02:38:59.796 --> 02:39:02.199
YEAH AGAIN I THINK THIS IS

02:39:02.266 --> 02:39:04.001
A FAIR COMPROMISE AND IF WE

02:39:04.067 --> 02:39:06.003
DID NOTHING YOU WOULD SEE

02:39:06.069 --> 02:39:07.771
THESE CONTINUE TO PROLIFERATE

02:39:07.838 --> 02:39:09.840
HAVE A TENFOLD INCREASE AND

02:39:09.907 --> 02:39:11.575
I THINK NOW IT'S NEARLY A

02:39:11.642 --> 02:39:12.542
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE

02:39:12.609 --> 02:39:14.411
SPENT AND IT WAS JUST MILLIONS

02:39:14.478 --> 02:39:15.646
OF YEARS AGO SO IN THREE OR

02:39:15.712 --> 02:39:16.914
FOUR YEARS WE COULD BE GETTING

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:18.515
CLOSE TO A BILLION AND THERE

02:39:18.582 --> 02:39:20.117
WILL BE NO ADULTS AT BECAUSE

02:39:20.183 --> 02:39:22.052
WHY WOULD AN ADULT AT SCHOOL

02:39:22.119 --> 02:39:24.221
STAINED BUSINESSES IT'S LIKE

02:39:24.288 --> 02:39:25.889
A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM OR HIGHER

02:39:25.956 --> 02:39:27.157
EDUCATION PROGRAM IF YOU COULD

02:39:27.224 --> 02:39:28.859
GO TO ONE WINDOW FROM THE

02:39:28.926 --> 02:39:30.394
STATE AND GET A REIMBURSEMENT

02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:31.395
AND THE OTHER ONE GET TWICE

02:39:31.461 --> 02:39:32.663
AS MUCH MONEY OVER THERE WHY

02:39:32.729 --> 02:39:33.463
WOULD YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE AND

02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:36.566
WE DON'T NUMBER ONE SO -- --

02:39:36.633 --> 02:39:38.268
AND AND AND AGAIN THIS IS ONE

02:39:38.335 --> 02:39:40.437
OF SEVEN ISSUES HERE ON OUR

02:39:40.504 --> 02:39:41.738
ON THE BEST LIST BUT THIS IS

02:39:41.805 --> 02:39:42.906
THE ONE THAT CERTAINLY HAS

02:39:42.973 --> 02:39:44.808
THE MOST INTERESTING AND WE'LL

02:39:44.875 --> 02:39:46.643
SEE IF WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT

02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:48.245
BUT TO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:39:48.312 --> 02:39:49.813
THERE WAS AS MUCH CONSTERNATION

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.682
FROM THE OPERATORS ACROSS

02:39:51.748 --> 02:39:53.917

02:42:32.209 --> 02:42:33.343
THE PLANNING PARTNERS EASILY

02:42:33.410 --> 02:42:34.744
COULD HAVE SAID WE REALLY

02:42:34.811 --> 02:42:35.812
NEED TO ATTEND RUN THE FRONT

02:42:35.879 --> 02:42:37.147
LINES BUT INSTEAD THEY DOUBLE

02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:38.748
DOWN ON THE PLANNING PROCESS

02:42:38.815 --> 02:42:39.549
BECAUSE THEY REALISE THEY

02:42:39.616 --> 02:42:40.650
REALLY NEEDED THE INFORMATION

02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:41.685
THAT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE

02:42:41.751 --> 02:42:43.820
BY LINKING EXISTING DATASETS

02:42:43.887 --> 02:42:45.088
-- AND THEREFORE WANTED TO MAKE

02:42:45.155 --> 02:42:46.690
SURE THAT IT BECAME A REALITY

02:42:46.756 --> 02:42:48.024
FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

ON BASE IS WITH EVERYTHING THAT

02:42:51.361 --> 02:42:52.496
WE KNOW THAT IS WORKING WELL

02:42:52.562 --> 02:42:53.663
ACROSS THE COUNTRY C.

02:42:53.730 --> 02:42:54.965
WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH OTHER

02:42:55.031 --> 02:42:56.533
STATES AND NATIONAL EXPERTS

02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:57.501
AS WELL AS FOLKS RIGHT HERE

02:42:57.567 --> 02:42:58.802
IN CALIFORNIA THEY'VE DONE A

02:42:58.869 --> 02:43:00.537
FANTASTIC JOB OF LINKING DATA

02:43:00.604 --> 02:43:02.205
ON A SMALLER SCALE IN ORDER TO

02:43:02.272 --> 02:43:03.607
COME UP WITH THE BEST OF BREED

02:43:03.673 --> 02:43:05.942
MODEL FOR CALIFORNIA WE WERE

02:43:06.009 --> 02:43:07.344
ABLE TO BRING THIS MODEL OUT TO

02:43:07.410 --> 02:43:08.545
THE PUBLIC WE HAD A SERIES OF

02:43:08.612 --> 02:43:09.880

THAN EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:43:12.616 --> 02:43:13.850
FIVE PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN

02:43:13.917 --> 02:43:15.552

REALLY APPRECIATED THE SCOPE

02:43:19.055 --> 02:43:20.257
OF THE TOOLS THAT THEY WOULD

02:43:20.323 --> 02:43:21.424
BE VERY USEFUL FOR THEIR

02:43:21.491 --> 02:43:23.593
IMMEDIATE NEEDS TO THE REPORT

02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:24.828

02:43:24.895 --> 02:43:26.663
IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE INCLUDES

02:43:26.730 --> 02:43:27.631
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT

THE LEGISLATION IDENTIFIED

02:43:28.999 --> 02:43:30.433
NEEDED TO BE COVERED FOR THE

02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:32.502
DATA SYSTEM -- THERE WILL BE

02:43:32.569 --> 02:43:33.570
A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK THAT'S

02:43:33.637 --> 02:43:35.372
HAPPENING TO THE REMAINDER OF

02:43:35.438 --> 02:43:37.607
-- THAT NEXT THREE MONTHS ALL

02:43:37.674 --> 02:43:38.775
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH LOOKING

02:43:38.842 --> 02:43:40.410
AT OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

02:43:40.477 --> 02:43:42.579

FOR AN ADDITIONAL SET OF FUNDS

02:43:52.255 --> 02:43:53.757
THAT WERE ALREADY APPROPRIATED

02:43:53.823 --> 02:43:54.958
IS TO BE TO DO A PROOF OF

02:43:55.025 --> 02:43:56.760
CONCEPT AND THIS IS IMPORTANT

02:43:56.826 --> 02:43:57.894
BECAUSE IT WILL SHORE UP THE

02:43:57.961 --> 02:43:59.362
UNDERLYING DATA INFRASTRUCTURE

02:43:59.429 --> 02:44:00.997

02:44:14.511 --> 02:44:15.712
GET MUCH MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT

02:44:15.779 --> 02:44:17.814
ONGOING COSTS THE DATA SYSTEM

02:44:17.881 --> 02:44:18.715
AND PROBABLY WANT TO SHARE

02:44:53.817 --> 02:44:55.318
POINT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:44:55.385 --> 02:44:58.822

WHY WE'RE DOING THIS IT'S NOT

02:47:56.699 --> 02:47:58.268
CLEAR TO ME WHY WE NEED THIS

02:47:58.334 --> 02:48:00.570
I HEAR OTHER STATES HAVE A

THIS MONEY SHOULD GO INTO THE

NO BOARD POSITIONS DESIGNATED

02:48:49.419 --> 02:48:50.787
FOR THE EARLY LEARNING AND

02:48:50.854 --> 02:48:53.289
CARE -- AND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS

02:48:53.356 --> 02:48:55.158
AN UNDERSTANDING THAT CD NDSS

OF YOU KNOW ME YOU KNOW WHAT

I'M GOING TO SAY HERE I THINK

03:07:26.034 --> 03:07:28.236
-- THIS NEEDS TO BE APPROACHED

03:07:28.303 --> 03:07:31.206

GOING TO COLLEGE GETTING THAT'S

03:07:39.548 --> 03:07:41.049
WHAT ISSUE BUT WHAT I'M MOST

03:07:41.116 --> 03:07:42.951
CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IS THE

03:07:43.018 --> 03:07:44.453
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

03:07:44.519 --> 03:07:45.887
SUCH A POLICY THAT COULD PUT

03:07:45.954 --> 03:07:47.789
STUDENTS IN JAIL ULTIMATELY OR

HAVE THEM DEPORTED YES SOMEONE

03:07:49.625 --> 03:07:50.492
IS ON THE GROUND I THINK WE

03:07:50.559 --> 03:07:51.426
NEED TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE WHO'S

03:07:51.493 --> 03:07:52.294
ON THE GRAHAM WHO'S BEEN ON

03:07:52.361 --> 03:07:54.262
THE GROUND OKAY GOOD I HAVE --

03:07:54.329 --> 03:07:55.931
HAD STUDENTS FALL THE FASTER

03:07:55.998 --> 03:07:57.933
MY POSTURE MANY TIMES IN CANCER

03:07:58.000 --> 03:07:59.801
COMMAND IT'S A TOMORROW OVER

03:07:59.868 --> 03:08:01.069
THE COUNCIL'S COME IN EVEN IF

YOUR NUMBER IF YOU HAVE ONE AND

03:08:06.908 --> 03:08:08.276
AS I REPEATED IN THE PAST MANY

03:08:08.343 --> 03:08:10.045
STUDENTS THAT MIGHT GO HOME

03:08:10.112 --> 03:08:11.413
AND SAY HEY MOM DAD I NEED MY

03:08:11.480 --> 03:08:12.648

03:08:13.882 --> 03:08:16.251
FOR THE FIRST TIME ANY OTHER

03:08:16.318 --> 03:08:17.252
STUDENTS DON'T FIND THAT OUT

03:08:17.319 --> 03:08:18.086
AND THEY PROBABLY GO AHEAD AND

03:08:18.153 --> 03:08:19.454
FILL UP THE FAST THAT COULD

03:08:19.521 --> 03:08:20.689
PUT THEM IN A PRECARIOUS LEGAL

03:08:20.756 --> 03:08:22.624
SITUATION GOING FORWARD SO

03:08:22.691 --> 03:08:23.825
I THINK HOW THIS IS EMPLOYED

03:08:23.892 --> 03:08:27.462
ON THE GROUND -- EASE IS IT

03:08:27.529 --> 03:08:29.331
REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT

03:08:29.398 --> 03:08:30.699
REALLY THAT THROUGH THIS REALLY

03:08:30.766 --> 03:08:31.700
NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH

03:08:31.767 --> 03:08:32.801
BECAUSE I KNOW TO BE ON THE

03:08:32.868 --> 03:08:34.302
OUTSIDE SOUNDS GREAT OH MY

03:08:34.369 --> 03:08:35.704
GOSH FOR DOING A GREAT THING

03:08:35.771 --> 03:08:37.339
BUT YOUR MIGHT REALLY YOU PUT

03:08:37.406 --> 03:08:38.974
IN A CERTAIN GROUP OF STUDENTS

03:08:39.041 --> 03:08:41.677
AND A VERY BAD SPOT AND THEY

03:08:41.743 --> 03:08:42.811
MIGHT NOT KNOW EVEN FOR A

03:08:42.878 --> 03:08:45.881
COUPLE YEARS RIGHT -- BECAUSE

03:08:45.947 --> 03:08:47.249
THE THE THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

03:08:47.315 --> 03:08:48.784
MIGHT I'D COME UP TO LATER

03:08:48.850 --> 03:08:50.385
BUT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO

03:08:50.452 --> 03:08:51.553
BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS I KNOW

03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:53.221
IT SOUNDS GREAT OKAY AND THE

THERE'S A LOT OUT REACH THERE'S

03:10:52.107 --> 03:10:53.375
A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE

THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IN THAT

03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:17.699
RESEARCH DONE SHOWS THAT IF

03:16:17.765 --> 03:16:19.033
YOU ASK A STUDENT WHO DIDN'T

03:16:19.100 --> 03:16:20.435

05:05:20.268 --> 05:05:22.470
QUESTIONS BUT OVERALL OUR ARE

05:05:22.537 --> 05:05:24.205
RECOMMENDATION HERE IS SIMILAR

05:05:24.272 --> 05:05:25.674
TO OTHER ONGOING PROPOSALS IS

05:05:25.740 --> 05:05:27.876
TO REVISIT OF THE INITIATIVES

YOUR TO CONCERNS ARE ONE

05:05:40.255 --> 05:05:43.258
ONGOING VERSES ONE TIME AND IT

05:05:43.324 --> 05:05:44.793
IS WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL DOING

REMIND US YOUR I DON'T REMEMBER

05:05:50.265 --> 05:05:51.633
THAT THIS THE FEEDBACK HE GAVE

05:05:51.700 --> 05:05:53.301
US -- ON THESE TWO PROPOSALS

05:05:53.368 --> 05:05:55.637
HE HAD SENT SOME CONSTRUCTIVE

05:05:55.704 --> 05:05:57.772
CRITICISM ON ON ON -- THESE

05:05:57.839 --> 05:05:59.240
EFFORTS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS

05:05:59.307 --> 05:06:01.609

SURE FORCING FOR THE BOOKS

05:06:03.244 --> 05:06:05.580
PROGRAM -- ARE CONCERNED WITH

05:06:05.647 --> 05:06:07.949
A FEW CONCERNS FOR ONE CONCERN

05:06:08.016 --> 05:06:10.118
IS THAT -- LIBRARIES ALREADY

05:06:10.185 --> 05:06:11.786
SPEND A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

05:06:11.853 --> 05:06:13.988
LOCAL RESOURCES TO PURCHASING

05:06:14.055 --> 05:06:17.058
MATERIALS -- SIGNIFICANTLY

05:06:17.125 --> 05:06:18.293
MORE FUNDING THAN WHAT WHAT HAS

05:06:18.359 --> 05:06:19.861
BEEN PROPOSED IN PREVIOUS YEARS

05:06:19.928 --> 05:06:20.962
-- IN TERMS OF ONE MILLION

05:06:21.029 --> 05:06:23.164
DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING ON

05:06:23.231 --> 05:06:25.300
SO IT IT DOES ARE DISCOVERING

05:06:25.366 --> 05:06:27.736
THINGS THAT -- LIBRARIES TO

05:06:27.802 --> 05:06:29.971
COVER OTHER LOCAL RESOURCES

05:06:30.038 --> 05:06:31.673
-- ANOTHER CONCERN WE'VE HAD

05:06:31.740 --> 05:06:33.241
FOR THE BOOKS PROGRAM IS THAT

05:06:33.308 --> 05:06:35.110
ON SOME PREVIOUS ANALYSES

05:06:35.176 --> 05:06:37.145
HAVE FOUND THAT THEY GENERATE

05:06:37.212 --> 05:06:39.280
SAVINGS FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES

05:06:39.347 --> 05:06:40.448
ARE WE THINK THOSE LIBRARIES

05:06:40.515 --> 05:06:41.516
COULD USE THOSE SAVINGS TO

05:06:41.583 --> 05:06:42.951
HELP SUPPORT OF THE BOOKS

05:06:43.017 --> 05:06:45.220
PROGRAMMING ON ONE BASIS AND

05:06:45.286 --> 05:06:46.755
THEN THERE ARE THEIR CONCERN

05:06:46.821 --> 05:06:48.289
IT'S ABOUT THIS SORT OF ISSUE

05:06:48.356 --> 05:06:50.792
EMISSIONS SCOPE SO -- IS THE

05:06:50.859 --> 05:06:52.327
BOOKS PROGRAM WHAT WE THINK

05:06:52.393 --> 05:06:54.095
COULD BE JUSTIFIED FOR SOME

05:06:54.162 --> 05:06:56.164
OF WORLD LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS

05:06:56.231 --> 05:06:57.132
THAT WAS SORT OF THE ORIGINAL

05:06:57.198 --> 05:06:58.633
INTENT OF THE PROGRAM WAS

05:06:58.700 --> 05:07:01.102
TO EXPAND ACCESS TO LIBRARY

05:07:01.169 --> 05:07:03.471
RESOURCES FOR WORK HOLD

05:07:03.538 --> 05:07:06.074
LEVERAGE RESTRICTIONS THAT --

05:07:06.141 --> 05:07:07.909
I CAN'T EASILY TAKE ADVANTAGE

05:07:07.976 --> 05:07:08.943
OF THINGS LIKE INTERLIBRARY

05:07:09.010 --> 05:07:10.211
LOAN IT MIGHT BE VERY EXPENSIVE

05:07:10.278 --> 05:07:12.714
FOR THOSE BY BURGER SECTIONS

05:07:12.781 --> 05:07:14.048
ARE NOT ALL THE PARTICIPATING

05:07:14.115 --> 05:07:15.183
PARTICIPATING JURISDICTIONS

05:07:15.250 --> 05:07:16.718
ARE WORLD THERE ARE -- SOME

I'VE HEARD THIS THAT IT'S NOT

05:33:18.111 --> 05:33:20.213
JUST HASTINGS BUT ACROSS LAW

05:33:20.280 --> 05:33:23.216

THAT YOU SEE GOING INTO THIS

05:33:35.195 --> 05:33:38.031
HUGE INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS

THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION OUR

05:33:39.666 --> 05:33:41.201
APPLICATIONS ROB ABOUT TWENTY

05:33:41.267 --> 05:33:43.103
PERCENT NATIONWIDE OURS UP

ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY

05:33:44.237 --> 05:33:46.740
SIX PERCENT -- I THINK THAT

05:33:46.806 --> 05:33:49.008
THAT'S ATTRIBUTABLE PARTLY TO

05:33:49.075 --> 05:33:50.410
REPUTATION OF SAN FRANCISCO

05:33:50.477 --> 05:33:53.346
CALIFORNIA -- AND OF COURSE

05:33:53.413 --> 05:33:55.448
HE'S DOING THIS WELL I DO

05:33:55.515 --> 05:33:56.716
THINK THAT APPLICATIONS HAVE

05:33:56.783 --> 05:33:58.017
BEEN UP OVER THE LAST COUPLE

05:33:58.084 --> 05:33:59.452
OF YEARS I DO THINK THAT IF

05:33:59.519 --> 05:34:00.687
SOMEBODY TRIED TO THE BALL

05:34:00.754 --> 05:34:03.356
YOU ARE THE FOCUS ON DIVERSITY

05:34:03.423 --> 05:34:05.325
EQUITY INCLUSION I THINK IT'S

05:34:05.392 --> 05:34:07.060
UNACCEPTABLE TO SOCIAL JUSTICE

05:34:07.127 --> 05:34:08.728
INITIATIVES -- AND I THINK

05:34:08.795 --> 05:34:10.096
IT'S QUITE DEEP ATTRIBUTABLE

05:34:10.163 --> 05:34:12.432
TO -- THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND

05:34:12.499 --> 05:34:14.401
EVENTS OTHER HAPPENED OVER

05:34:14.467 --> 05:34:15.769
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THAT

05:34:15.835 --> 05:34:18.338
INDICATE THAT IN EDUCATION AND

05:34:18.405 --> 05:34:20.640
LAW UP TO MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL

05:34:20.707 --> 05:34:23.510
DIFFERENCE IN HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE

05:34:23.576 --> 05:34:26.513
THAT CITIZENS ARE AND WHAT

05:34:26.579 --> 05:34:27.781
OPPORTUNITIES THEY MIGHT THEY

05:34:27.847 --> 05:34:32.018
MIGHT HAVE US MULTI FACTOR --

05:34:32.085 --> 05:34:33.486
CIRCUMSTANCE I I DON'T THINK

05:34:33.553 --> 05:34:36.089
IT'S SPECIFICALLY KOPEN -- IN

05:34:36.156 --> 05:34:37.490
FACT IF ANYTHING WE THOUGHT

05:34:37.557 --> 05:34:38.925
THAT APPLICATIONS WOULD BE DOWN

05:34:38.992 --> 05:34:40.960
BECAUSE THE CODE -- AND THEY'RE

05:34:41.027 --> 05:34:42.495
UP AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN

05:34:42.562 --> 05:34:45.064
STRONG ALSO THE MARKET --

05:34:45.131 --> 05:34:47.300
FOR WARRIORS HAS BEEN STRONG

05:34:47.367 --> 05:34:48.568
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND

05:34:48.635 --> 05:34:50.036
WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WILL

05:34:50.103 --> 05:34:52.238
CONTINUE AND FINALLY I THINK

05:34:52.305 --> 05:34:54.974
HASTINGS HAS A REPUTATION FOR

05:34:55.041 --> 05:34:56.743
PRODUCING LEADERS AND PUBLIC

05:34:56.810 --> 05:34:58.912
INTEREST IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND

05:34:58.978 --> 05:35:01.147
I THINK THAT THAT WAS A GOOD

05:35:01.214 --> 05:35:02.949
DEAL OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

05:35:03.016 --> 05:35:07.220
YEARS IN PARTICULAR THIS YEAR

05:35:07.287 --> 05:35:09.222

I KNOW THAT IT'S AN ECONOMIES

05:35:19.499 --> 05:35:20.934
OF SCALE ARE DIFFERENT BUT

05:35:21.000 --> 05:35:23.436
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE FIND

05:35:23.503 --> 05:35:25.505
FOR THE STATE NOT INCLUDING

05:35:25.572 --> 05:35:28.274
YOUR TUITION I'M REVENUE JUST

05:35:28.341 --> 05:35:30.777
THE JUST THE GENERAL FUND --

05:35:30.844 --> 05:35:33.112
SUPPORT SO IT'S RIGHT SIXTEEN

05:35:33.179 --> 05:35:35.415
POINT EIGHT MILLION DIVIDED

BY YOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS

05:35:37.984 --> 05:35:39.752
GETS TO TAX AMOUNT PER STUDENT

05:35:39.819 --> 05:35:42.121
STATE SUPPORT IS THAT ROUGHLY

05:35:42.188 --> 05:35:46.259
EQUIVALENT TO UCLA BERKELEY

05:35:46.326 --> 05:35:49.362

05:35:49.429 --> 05:35:53.233

WELL IT'S IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT

05:35:54.968 --> 05:35:56.436
QUESTION TO ANSWER BECAUSE

05:35:56.503 --> 05:35:59.639
THE UC LAW SCHOOLS ARE DEEPLY

05:35:59.706 --> 05:36:02.408
EMBEDDED IN CAMPUS SETTINGS

05:36:02.475 --> 05:36:06.946
AND THIS IS MADE FROM THE LOCAL

05:36:07.013 --> 05:36:08.448
TRANSFERS OFFICE AS TO HOW

05:36:08.515 --> 05:36:09.782
TO ALLOCATE THE STATE FUNDS

05:36:09.849 --> 05:36:12.585
AMONG VARIOUS PROGRAMS SOME

05:36:12.652 --> 05:36:14.854
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS GET SUBS

05:36:14.921 --> 05:36:16.789
THEY SUPPORT AND SOME YOU SEE

05:36:16.856 --> 05:36:17.991
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS DO NOT GET

05:36:18.057 --> 05:36:19.893
STATE SUPPORT SO IT'S REALLY

05:36:19.959 --> 05:36:21.594
A DIFFICULT QUESTION THAT I

05:36:21.661 --> 05:36:26.032
DON'T HAVE A READY RESPONSE TO

FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH AND

05:36:27.400 --> 05:36:29.035
THAT THAT'S WHAT I WOULD EXPECT

05:36:29.102 --> 05:36:31.604

MEDICAL SCHOOLS AS WELL AS PART

05:36:35.074 --> 05:36:37.343
OF THE OVERALL CAMPUS BUDGET

05:36:37.410 --> 05:36:39.712
OKAY WITH THAT NO ACTION ITEM

05:36:39.779 --> 05:36:41.981
