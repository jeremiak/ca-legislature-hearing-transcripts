SHORTAGE OF SUBSTITUTES

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.051
SCHOOL THAT IS TO OPERATE A

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:41.986

THEY'RE DOING TO SERVE

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:51.262
CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN FROM MY

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:52.730
OBSERVATION CLASS SIZES ARE

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:54.432
TYPICALLY SMALL SMALLER BECAUSE-

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:55.866
SOME STUDENTS ARE ABSENT FOR A

00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:57.334
VARIETY OF REASONS SOME OF THE

00:38:57.401 --> 00:39:00.004
COVERT RELATED I WOULD IMAGINE-

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:02.106
BUT AGAIN IT'S AN INTERESTING

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:03.974
MOMENT. SOME OF THE STUDENTS ARE

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:05.309
ENROLLED STUDENTS INDEPENDENT

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:08.279
STUDY PROGRAMS. SOME HAVE MOVED.

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:09.680
SOME ARE NOT COMING TO SCHOOL

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:12.083
ALL SUMMER ONLINE. SO THERE'S A

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:15.486
VARIETY OF FACTORS ASSOCIATED

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:16.987
WITH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. AND

00:39:17.054 --> 00:39:18.189
REMEMBER MANY OF THE STUDENTS

00:39:18.255 --> 00:39:19.890
LIVE IN MULTI GENERATIONAL

00:39:19.957 --> 00:39:21.826
HOUSEHOLDS RIGHT. HI SUMMER IS

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:24.095
OUR STATE NOT SO PROBLEMS OTHERS

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:26.897
ARE STATE VERY PREVALENT. AND SO

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:27.598
THEY HAVE TO OFTENTIMES TAKE

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:29.300
EXTRA CARE. NOT TO GIVE THE

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:30.901
PEOPLE IN THE HOME ELEVEN

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:31.769
COVERED BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:33.637
ELDERLY THEY MIGHT BE HAVE ALL

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:36.941
OF ORAL HEALTH STATUS. ALSO

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:39.810
PEOPLE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:40.911
TODAY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:42.413
FEAR OF MANY SCHOOL LEADERS THAT

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.414
BECAUSE OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:44.815
AND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM A

00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:47.718
PORTION. LEVELS WILL DROP. AND I

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:49.386
THINK AT THE BUDGET LEVEL WE CAN

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:51.489
WE CAN DO A LOT TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:52.990
TO ENSURE THAT- CALIFORNIA

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:54.625
SCHOOL FUNDING OVER HISTORIC

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:55.860
NEXT YEAR WE WILL NOT SEE A

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:57.995
DROP. JUST BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF

00:39:58.062 --> 00:39:59.697
STUDENTS ATTENDING CALIFORNIA

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:00.898
SCHOOLS HAS DROPPED WE NEED TO

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:03.534
KEEP CLIMBING- SO THAT WE CAN

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:05.503
ADEQUATELY FUND OUR SCHOOLS IN

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:06.837
FACT WE'RE STILL ONE OF THE

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.038
LOWEST IN THE STATES ON A PER

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.807
STUDENT. BASIS WE NEED TO CHANGE

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:12.176
THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:14.378
CHANGE THAT. PLEASE PLEASE KEEP

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.346

BE BUILT BACK BETTER- AND WHILE

EVERY SINGLE MOMENT- I'VE HAD

EVEN SINCE BEFORE SCHOOL

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:17.421

TO VISIT DOZENS OF SCHOOL

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.657
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE AND OUR

SCHOOLS ARE OPEN AND THEY ARE

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:24.094
DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE UNDER WHAT

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:25.262
FEELS LIKE IMPOSSIBLE

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:27.297
CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY RECOGNIZE

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:29.299

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:30.667
PANDEMIC THEY RECOGNIZE THAT

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:32.036
THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES

00:44:32.102 --> 00:44:33.437
RACIAL CHALLENGES AND SOCIAL

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:35.572
JUSTICE ISSUES THEY RECOGNIZE

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.141
THAT NINETEEN COUNTIES IN OUR

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:41.845
STATE HAVE EXPERIENCE FIRE.

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:42.479
SCHOOLS HAVE BURNED DOWN PEOPLE

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:43.080
OF LOS THEIR HOMES THINGS HAVE

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:44.248
BEEN A THE- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:45.416
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:46.417
THE TOUGHEST TIME THAT WE WILL

SHORTAGES- THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:57.661
TALKING ABOUT TODAY DECLINING

00:44:57.728 --> 00:44:59.296
ENROLLMENT. BUT I BELIEVE THAT

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:00.330
OUR STUDENTS AND OUR SCHOOLS

00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:02.833
REPRESENT MORE THAN THE SUM OF

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.701
OUR EXPERIENCES OUR STUDENTS

00:45:04.768 --> 00:45:06.336
HAVE DEMONSTRATED AN INCREDIBLE

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:07.738
KIND OF RESILIENCE. OUR

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.773
EDUCATORS CONTINUE TO LEAN IN TO

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.675
GIVE THE BEST OUR FAMILIES

00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:13.644
CONTINUE TO LEAN IN TO GIVE THE

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.580
BEST. TO OUR STUDENTS AND AS WE

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:18.715
ARE IN THIS MOMENT. WE HAVE TO

00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:20.751
UTILIZE THIS MOMENT TO FIGURE

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:21.752
OUT HOW WE WILL BUILD AN

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:23.720
EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT IS BETTER

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:25.489
THAN WHAT WE HAVE HAD BEFORE. IT

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:28.158
HAS SPOTLIGHTED MANY INEQUITIES

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:30.160
STARTING IN THE PANDEMIC AT THE

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:31.929
BEGINNING OF IT. WHEN WE SAW

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:32.963
THAT A MILLION STUDENTS DID NOT

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.332
HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTING DEVICES

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:37.267
AND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. THIS

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:38.936
LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR STEPPED

00:45:39.002 --> 00:45:40.137
IN AND MADE SURE THAT

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:41.872
IMMEDIATELY THERE'D BE RESOURCES

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:43.373
TO SUPPORT. THOSE STUDENTS TO

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.509
BEGIN THE WORK TO CLOSE THE

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:48.045
DIGITAL DIVIDE- THIS LEGISLATURE

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:49.546
AND THIS GOVERNOR OFFICE OF ALL

00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:50.447
WORK TOGETHER ON THINGS TO

00:45:50.514 --> 00:45:51.915
ADDRESS. COLD MEDICATIONS

00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:53.484
DIRECTLY WITH COVERT TESTING

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:55.352
ENOUGH VACCINES. BUT YET IN

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:56.753
SPITE OF ALL OF THIS WE SEE

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.289
THAT- THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO

00:45:59.356 --> 00:46:02.559
EVOLVE. EVEN AS WE SPEAK TODAY

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:04.094
HEALTH EXPERTS ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:06.130
A NEW CHALLENGE. A NEW VARIANT

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:08.499
THAT REPRESENTS A NEW THREAT TO

00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:09.833
US TO OUR WAY OF LIFE NOT JUST

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.002
TO OUR SCHOOLS BUT TO OUR ENTIRE

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:13.470
WAY OF LIFE OUR ENTIRE WAY OF

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.706
SURVIVAL. ARE SMALL BUSINESSES

00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:17.441
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE KNOW

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:19.209
THAT OUR KIDS DESERVE IN MUST

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:21.211
STILL GET AN EDUCATION. AND SO

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.579
WHILE WE CONTINUE TO WORK

00:46:22.646 --> 00:46:23.714
THROUGH THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.749
SEE IN OUR SCHOOLS WE KNOW THAT

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:26.850
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:28.819
CAN DO. TO BUILD SCHOOLS BETTER

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:30.454
THAN WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE IN

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:31.321
THIS LEGISLATURE AND THIS

00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:32.356

PROGRAMS. HAVE PROVIDED

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:36.293
INCREDIBLE PROGRAMS FOR DOING

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.162
THAT AND IT'LL BE IMPORTANT. WE

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:41.331
TALK ABOUT UNIVERSAL T. K. IT

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:41.965
WILL BE IMPORTANT. IF YOU LOOK

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:42.833
AT THE BIG. ENROLLMENT TRENDS

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.902
THEY TEN TO BE GREATEST. IN THE

LOWER GRADES INDICATE THREE

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:48.472
<u>PAN. AND SO THIS IS A</u>

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.374
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. BUT

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.509
HAVING UNIVERSAL TKA REPRESENTS

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:54.578
A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY THIS

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:55.445
IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED

00:46:55.512 --> 00:46:56.647

00:53:58.535 --> 00:53:59.869
THE- CA. AND IN THE BUDGET

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:02.339
COMMITTEE. AND WHEN YOU THINK

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:04.841
ABOUT THE PANDEMIC IT'S REALLY

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:06.776
ABOUT ITS IMPACT ON STUDENTS

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:08.211
GETTING BACK IN SCHOOL AND

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:09.546
PARENTS GETTING BACK TO WORK AND

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:10.914
HAVING A FUNCTIONING ECONOMY

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:13.383
WHICH- SCHOOLS ARE OPERATING AND

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.318
HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE-

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:16.586
FOCUS ON STUDENTS WHO WERE

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:18.221
FRANKLY BEHIND BEFORE THE

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.556
PANDEMIC AND YOU KNOW BUILD

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:21.124
BACK. BETTER FOR IT FOR

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:23.760
EVERYBODY. THE ISSUE THAT I

00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:25.495
THINK I'M HEARING MAYBE YOU CAN

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:27.797
ENLIGHTEN US. IS THAT IT FROM

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:30.433
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTSJUST ON THE

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.135
MONEY PIECE IT'S A DISCONNECT.

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:34.804
BECAUSE WE SEE. THESE REPORTS AS

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:37.641
FAR AS RECORD REVENUE COMING IN

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:39.075
TO CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW AS WE

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:40.510
KNOW THE WEALTHY ARE DOING VERY

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:42.479
WELL. IN OUR STATE SPACE IS THE

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:44.114
BEST LEAD AFTER THE PANDEMIC

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.149
STARTED. RECORD AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:49.252
COMING IN THE CAPITAL GAINS ONE

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:49.819
TIME SO YOU LOOK AT THAT ONE

00:54:49.886 --> 00:54:53.156
TIME MONEY. WITH THE STATE MONEY

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:55.091
LAST THE FEDERAL WE'RE TALKING

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:56.259
FORTY BILLION DOLLARS WHICH

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:58.094
YOU'RE RIGHT DISTRICTS CAN'T USE

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.863
THAT FOR ON GOING AND THEY SAY

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:01.598
THAT- WE CAN'T IS AN ON GOING

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:03.233
BUT STILL WE HAVE WE HAVE NORTH

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:06.069
OF TWENTY BILLION AND ONGOING

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:07.370
JUST PUT IN PERSPECTIVE THREE

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:14.377
YEARS AGO MR. ON THE TWENTY

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:15.645
TWENTY TO BALLOT TO INCREASE

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:17.580
TAXES ON THE HIGHEST EARNERS TO

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.749
GET CALIFORNIA IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:21.484
THE PACK FOR PEOPLE FUNDING WELL

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:23.219
THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT'S

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:24.788
HAPPENED I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:27.057
THIS NEW AND IT'S HARDER BECAUSE

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.925
TO PROJECT IN THAT TAKES AWHILE

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:29.893
TO SEE IT BUT APPLES TO APPLES

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:32.729
BUT- CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOW IN THE

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:34.564
MIDDLE THE PACK SO. HOW DO YOU

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:35.365
HOW DO YOU FOCUS ON THIS

00:55:35.432 --> 00:55:37.300
DISCONNECT THAT SOME DISTRICTS

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:38.868
ARE LIKE THE SKY IS FALLING

00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:40.103
THROUGH IS THAT THERE IS THIS

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:41.971
THE CLIFF AND WE'RE GOING TO GO

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:42.639
OFF THE CLIFF IS I WANT TO MONEY

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:45.442
WHEN WE HAVE. TWENTY BILLION A

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:47.444
GENERATIONAL CHANGE AS FAR AS

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.912
INVESTING IN OUR SCHOOLS WHAT

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.013
WILL BE BUT THE VOTERS WERE

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.915
PROMISED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:53.616
EIGHT WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL HERE

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:55.318
AND SALAS TV COMMERCIALS FOR

00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:56.319
THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE PUBLIC

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:57.754
SCHOOL FUNDING NOW WE'RE KIND OF

00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:59.823
THERE AND SO WE'RE HEARING THESE

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:02.158
TWO THINGS AND SO HAVE YOU GO TO

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:03.860
SCHOOLS LIKE I DID. I WAS AT A

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:05.361
SCHOOL YESTERDAY IN OUR AND OUR

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:07.530
SUPERINTENDENT SAID YOU KNOW WE

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:08.932
HAVE SOME DECLINING ENROLLMENT

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:10.600
HERE FOR JUST POPULATION

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:12.469
DECLINES IN AS WE SING ALL

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:13.403
ACROSS CALIFORNIA NOT

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.771
STABILIZATION IN SOME OF THESE

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:17.741
NEIGHBORHOODS HE SAID 95% OF THE

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:18.641
PARENTS ARE HAVE GONE BACK

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:20.944
ABOUT. 5% ARE DOING INDEPENDENT

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:24.013
STUDY BUT ARE STILL IN THE

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.548
SCHOOL SYSTEM SO THEY'RE NOT. SO

00:56:25.615 --> 00:56:26.583
HOW DO WE RECONCILE THESE TWO

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:28.885
THINGS TONS OF NEW MONEY IN SOME

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:33.323
DISTRICTS LIKE FREAKING OUT.

00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:34.057
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:35.892
I WOULD JUST SAY I WOULD ASK YOU

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:37.293
TO THINK ABOUT YOUR QUESTION IN

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.295
THE CONTEXT OF TO SPECIFIC

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:41.664
AREAS- STAFFING AND STAFFING

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:44.434
SHORTAGES- AND IF WE JUST USE

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:46.503
UNIVERSAL MEALS AS AN EXAMPLE-

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:48.605
UNIVERSAL MEALS IS AN INCREDIBLE

00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:49.072
THING IS AN INCREDIBLE

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:50.740
OPPORTUNITY. BUT RIGHT NOW THIS

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:52.542
STATE JUST LIKE ALL OF THIS

00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:53.543
NATION IS EXPERIENCING A

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.012
SHORTAGE IN SUPPLY IN ORDER FOR

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.480
SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL

00:56:57.547 --> 00:57:00.750
MEALS THEIR COSTS ARE READY. UP

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:02.218
ARE GOING UP AND WILL GO UP

00:57:02.285 --> 00:57:04.220
HIGHER IN SO THERE ARE COST

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.755
CONSIDERATIONS MATTER FACT I WAS

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.257
THINKING THE LAST TIME I SAT IN

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:09.025

TALKED ABOUT WHAT YOU IN

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.229
TERMINAL DAHLE TALKED ABOUT

00:57:13.296 --> 00:57:14.931
TODAY. THAT OUR SCHOOLS WERE

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:17.934
ALREADY FACING- LACK OF REVENUE

00:57:18.001 --> 00:57:20.570
NECESSARY TO OPERATE- TO PAY

00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:22.939
STAFF TO PROVIDE THE OPERATIONS

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:24.641
FOR OUR CORE OPERATIONS IN OUR

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:27.443
SCHOOLS AND SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:29.612
THE PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED ALL

00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:31.214
OF THAT. IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.383
APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUPPORT THAT

00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:34.818
HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN THIS

00:57:34.884 --> 00:57:36.886
ONGOING ADA- BECAUSE THE

00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:38.822
PANDEMIC'S NOT OVER- SCHOOLS ARE

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:40.423
SAYING HEY WE'RE APPROACHING THE

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.192
CLIFF AND THEY'RE SAYING YOU

SEE THE CHALLENGES. OF YOU KNOW

00:57:48.398 --> 00:57:49.632
STUDENTS WHO WERE IN QUARANTINE

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:51.701
STUDENTS WHOSE ATTENDANCE HAS

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:53.169
BEEN- WHO HAD CHRONIC

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:54.637
ABSENTEEISM YOU'LL HEAR FROM

00:57:54.704 --> 00:57:55.839
SOME DISTRICTS TODAY THAT WILL

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:57.540
TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:58.975
WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK CLOSELY

00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:00.343
WITH OAKLAND IN INGLEWOOD

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:01.978
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON SOME

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:03.146
PROGRAMS THAT WE THINK MIGHT

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:04.914
HELP TO. COUNTER SOME OF THE

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:06.850
DECLINING- OR THE CHRONIC

00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:09.052
ABSENTEEISM BUT- SCHOOLS ARE

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:10.987
SAYING THAT OUR COSTS ARE HIGH

00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:12.722
THERE ARE SCHOOLS LIKE EVERY

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:14.657
SECTOR IN THIS STATE IN THIS

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:17.527
NATION ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING- IN

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:19.996
AVAILABILITY OF STAFF TO HIRE TO

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:22.131
HIRE NEW STAFF. AND WHEN YOU

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:23.733
LOOK AT THE SALARIES THAT SCHOOL

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.569
STAFF GET PAID ON AVERAGE IT'S

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.671
LOW AND WHEN SCHOOLS ARE LOOKING

00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:32.075
TO HIRE STAFF THEY EVEN

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:32.709
SUBSTITUTES THEY'VE AT RATCHET

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.410
UP. WHAT THEY PAY TO GET MORE

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:35.645
STAFF AND EVEN THEN THEY CANNOT

00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:37.480
GET STAFF. BECAUSE OF A

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:39.482
NATIONWIDE STAFFING SHORTAGE IN

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:42.418
SO ONE TIME DOLLARS FOR PROGRAMS

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:43.920
ARE HELPFUL TO SUPPORT

00:58:43.987 --> 00:58:46.489
PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS BUT DON'T BE

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:48.858
QUITE. TO THE SAME NEED FOR

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:51.294
ONGOING OPERATIONS THAT OUR

00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:52.829
SCHOOLS NEED TO HAVE YOU HERE

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:53.663
THANK YOU FOR ME YOU'LL HEAR

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:54.898
FROM DISTRICTS TODAY THAT YOU'VE

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:56.499
ASSEMBLED TO GIVE YOUR TESTIMONY

00:58:56.566 --> 00:58:58.201
THEY'LL TELL YOU. THEY CANNOT

00:58:58.268 --> 00:59:00.270
HIGHER CLASSIFIED STAFF TEACHING

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:02.572
STAFF SUBSTITUTES BECAUSE THEY

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:04.674
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO OFFER

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:06.409
WAGES THAT WILL OFFSET THE

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:07.977
STAFFING SHORTAGE IN THIS STATE

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:10.346
AND IN THIS NATION. AND ALSO

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:11.681
INCREASE THE SALARIES OF THOSE

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:12.715
THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE IN

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:14.317
THERE IN THE CURRENT STAFFING

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:15.985
ROLES AND SO I THINK THAT IF YOU

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:16.619
JUST THINK OF THESE TWO

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:18.321
EXAMPLES. THEY GIVEYOU A WAY TO

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.889
THINK ABOUT WHY EVEN WITH THE

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:21.457
INFLUX OF DOLLARS THAT ARE

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:24.727
COMING- IT IS NOT. THE SAME AS

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:26.696
HELPING THEIR OPERATIONAL NEEDS

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:29.299
GOING FORWARD. OKAY THANK YOU.

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:30.767
QUESTIONS MISTER O'DONNELL YEAH

WE'RE PAYING APPROPRIATE PICTURE

00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:35.405
SCHOOLS ARE OPEN YES OKAY I'VE

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:37.006
BEEN IN SCHOOLS. I GOT A

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:39.275
DAUGHTER IN HIGH SCHOOL SHE GOES

00:59:39.342 --> 00:59:40.977
TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY. THE SCHOOL

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:43.012
IS FULLY STAFFED YES SOMETIMES

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:44.814
SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS ALL RIGHT

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.049
CHALLENGE I THINK WE NEED TO

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:47.517
LOOK AT THAT I MEAN I. I HEARD

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:48.451
OF ONE DISTURBING THESE PAY

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:49.585
THERE'S PAYING A HUNDRED BUCKS A

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:50.653
DAY THAT PROBABLY ENDS UP BEING

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.821
LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE IF YOU DO

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:53.690
A FULL DAY OF TEACHING RIGHT.

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:56.659
WHICH IS CRAZY TO ME- NO WONDER

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:57.827
GOTTA COMPENSATE PEOPLE

00:59:57.894 --> 00:59:59.629
ADEQUATELY. AND REMEMBER YOU'RE

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.130
ALSO ASKING PEOPLE TO GO INTO A

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:02.298
CLASSROOM WITH THE PROBABLY

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:03.866
CULPRIT IN MANY CASES RIGHT.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:06.536
IT'S OUT THERE RIGHT SO YOU NEED

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:07.670
TO BE WE NEED YOU KNOW ASKING

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:08.638
THEM TO DO THAT AND AGAIN IT

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:09.839
GOES BACK TO MY STATE WHERE IT'S

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.174
ASIER FOR SACRAMENTO THEY OPEN

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.742
THE SCHOOLS. IT'S MUCH HARDER TO

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:14.544
DO IT AND YET THAT HAS BEEN DONE

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.163
THESE REASONS ARE. HAPPENING SO

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:56.478
CONVERSATIONS TO BETTER

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:57.912
UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES. AND

01:21:57.979 --> 01:21:59.547
PERSPECTIVES AND CURRENT

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:04.219
ACCOUNTS ARE THEY ARE. MAKING IN

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:06.621
ADDRESSING THOSE CHALLENGES- THE

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:07.589
QUESTION WE WERE AT TO REALLY A

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.024
WAS HOW DOES THE COMING IN ON

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.625
THE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM FACT

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:12.460
EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:13.828
IN LEARNING AND I THINK IT'S NO

01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:15.964
SURPRISE WHEN WE SAY IT IT MAKES

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:18.166
IT DIFFICULT- ELLIE AS HAVE

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:20.769
EXPRESSED THAT NOT ONLY DOES IT

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:22.103
DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND THE

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.638
CHALLENGES ARE GREAT- WITH

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:25.940
FUNDING BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:27.509
CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM ISSUES THE

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:28.810
ABILITY TO HAVE STUDENTS IN

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.645
SCHOOL ON A REGULAR BASIS

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:31.946
COMPOUND THEIR ABILITIES TO

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:33.648
ADDRESS THE LITERACY ISSUES

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:34.749
CHALLENGES THAT THEIR STUDENTS

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:36.184
EIGHTEEN. SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:40.822
OF THE REGULATE AMPLIFIED.

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:43.992
NEARLY PROGRAMS THAT BEING SAID

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:44.693
. I THINK THERE ARE MANY MANY

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:47.762
MAYES THINGS ARE HAPPENING. ROSS

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.464
THE STATE THAT WE FOUND THAT ARE

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:51.666
BOTH- AT THE STATE LEGISLATIVE

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:54.102
LEVEL TO THE ALLEY A LEVEL

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.904
THERE'S AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:58.139
HARD WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY

01:22:58.206 --> 01:22:59.974
OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:01.643
COUNTY OFFICES AND EDUCATIONAL

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.712
LEADERS IN THE STATE AND I THINK

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:04.946
IT WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.414
JUST POTS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:07.449
HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THOSE

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:08.616
OPPORTUNITIES AND WHAT'S

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.118
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. AND

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:11.753
WHERE WE CAN LEARN FROM OTHERS

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.088
ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.522
BEING MADE IN ADDRESSING SOME F

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:17.492
THESE CHALLENGES. SO IT STATE

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.861
LEGISLATIVE- PERSPECTIVE THERE

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:22.731
ARE ONLY AS- COMMUNICATED FOUR

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:24.933
MAIN THEMES THEY SAID YOU KNOW

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:28.670
THEY THEY REALLY WOULD ALLOW.

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:31.406
THINK ABOUT. PATIENT FOR THEM IN

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:32.207
RELATIONSHIP TO THE CURRENT

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.008
INITIATIVES AS THEY BECOME

01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:36.378
ESTABLISHED. AS YOU REFLECT BACK

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.780
ON CURRENT OR PAST STATEWIDE

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.515
INITIATIVES SUCH AS- THIS

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.984
SCALING UP INTO OFFICE. WHEN WE

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.220
PASS THAT BACK IN SIXTEEN

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:46.121
SEVENTEEN WE ALLOCATED ABOUT TEN

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:47.455
MILLION DOLLARS TO THAT AS A

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:48.590
RESULT OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:23:48.656 --> 01:23:50.658
TASK FORCE REPORT. IT TOOK ABOUT

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:52.227
ONE AND A HALF TO TWO YEARS

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:53.962
BEFORE THAT INITIATIVE REALLY.

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:56.364
GAIN TRACTION AT THE L. A. LEVEL

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:58.700
THAT WAS UNDER- DIFFERENT

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:00.068
CONDITIONS OBVIOUSLY THE CURRENT

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:01.970
CONDITIONS MAKE THOSE-

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:04.839
CHALLENGES EVEN MORE OBVIOUS.

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:06.374
BUT THEY WANTED GRAYSON PATIENTS

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:08.076
WITH INITIATIVES BECOMING

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:11.012
REALITY. THEY WANTED- THAT THE

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:11.646
STATE LEGISLATURE I UNDERSTAND

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:14.616
THE CURRENT. ISSUES ARE THAT THE

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:16.885
CURRENT ISSUES. REQUIRED DEEP

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:18.453
COLLABORATION PROBLEM SOLVING

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.621
AMONGST STATE LEADERS AND

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:21.523
EDUCATORS AND THAT TAKES. TIME

01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:23.625
AND COMMITMENT. THEY WANTED OUR

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:24.793
STATE LEGISLATORS TO KNOW THAT

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:27.529
SCHOOLS ARE OPEN THEY ARE THE TO

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:29.697
CENTER OF DONALD'S POINT- WHEN

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:31.533
THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:33.201
CAN TO KEEP KIDS IN SCHOOL AND

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:35.904
THEY'RE HAVING. SUCCESS IN A

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:37.572
MYRIAD OF PLACES BUT THEY ARE

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:40.675
CHALLENGED OBVIOUSLY- OBVIOUSLY

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:42.577
THOSE CHALLENGES WILL BE TALKED

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:44.245
ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:45.413
AND THEN ALWAYS THINK ABOUT

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.848
INITIATIVES FROM THE POINT OF

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.583
EQUITY AND THE WAY THEY AFFECT

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:49.951
SMALL AND RULED LOCAL

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.886
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. SOMETIMES

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:53.254
IT'S CHALLENGING AS THEY THINK

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:59.060
ABOUT UNIVERSITY K&lt;c.cyan&gt; ACCESS.&lt;/c&gt;

01:24:59.127 --> 01:24:59.861
TO FACILITIES FOR PRE K. THE

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.296
SCHOOLS EXPAND MY UP. DOES TO

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:02.363
KEEP IN MIND. BUT MORE

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.065
IMPORTANTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING THE

01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:06.501
EDUCATION POLICY LEVEL ARE

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:07.602
OPPORTUNITIES TO THINK ABOUT

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:08.603
CAPACITY BUILDING AND BUILDING

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.538
THE CAPACITY OF CAPACITY

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:11.806
BUILDERS AND THE TIME TO

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:13.508
IMPLEMENT AND SEE CURRENT

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:14.108
RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS TAKE A

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:16.444
FACT. THE FOCUS ON STAFF

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:18.246
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION US

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.447
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THINKING

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:20.715
ABOUT THAT I MEAN THOSE

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:21.983
PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEIR

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.351
INSTITUTES OF HIGHER ED I CAN

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:25.019
THINK OF ONE EXAMPLE. FRESNO

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:27.956
COUNTY OFFICE OF ED HAS AND IS

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.691
PREPARING AN AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:30.925
TEACHER PIPELINE THAT BEGINS IN

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.193
KINDERGARTEN THAT'S INCREDIBLY

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.096
INNOVATIVE- INCREDIBLY HEAVY

01:25:35.163 --> 01:25:36.130
LEFT AND INVOLVES A LOT OF

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:37.365
PARTNERS BUT THEY'RE THINKING

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:39.400
THAT FAR AHEAD. AND ALSO YOUR

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:40.435
COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND EXPANDED

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:41.803
LEARNING AND CHOP EARLY

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.638
CHILDHOOD FUNDING INITIATIVES

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:45.240
THOSE ARE PREDICATED ON WHOLE

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:47.175
CHILD DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND THAT

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:48.676
REQUIRES A RETHINKING FOR THEM

01:25:48.743 --> 01:25:49.944
WITH A FOCUS ON TEACHING AND

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:53.848
LEARNING IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:54.482
THAN THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:56.451
. WITH COUNTY OFFICES THE IDEA

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:57.986
OF INVESTING IN SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:59.754
LEARNING MENTAL HEALTH. ONE OF

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.856
THE- HIGHLIGHTS WAS THE CAL HOPE

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:04.192
PRODUCT PROJECT OUT OF-

01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:05.193
SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.495
THAT. THAT INVOLVES ALL FIFTY

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:08.696
EIGHT COUNTY OFFICES AND AN

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:10.565
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:11.866
FOUR KELLY ACE. WHO ARE THINKING

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:13.902
ABOUT. THE OF THE WAYS TO

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:15.370
MITIGATE INSTRUCTIONAL BARRIERS

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.905
FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHEN

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:17.405
IT COMES TO INTEGRATING

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:20.174
SUPPORTS. FOR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL.

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:22.977
AND MENTAL HEALTH. INTERVENTIONS

01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:25.346
YOU ALSO HAVE A FOCUS ON. FROM

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:27.215
THE MERRY OUTOF ELEAZAR WHO ARE

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:27.882
THINKING ABOUT DATA IN A

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:30.018
DIFFERENT WAY. THEIR FOCUS ON

01:26:30.084 --> 01:26:31.486
THE LCF STUDENT GROUPS THAT ARE

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.555
HAVING THE MOST DIFFICULTY

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.089
ATTENDING SCHOOL E. I HEARD IT

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:36.591
OUT FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER.

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:37.859
YOUR HOMELESS AND FOSTER

01:26:37.926 --> 01:26:39.427
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES.

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.329
STUDENTS OF COLOR SKIP

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:42.997
UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE STUDENTS

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:44.866
ARE KNOWING THAT THE TENSIONS

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.601
THAT THEIR FAMILIES ARE FACING

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:47.769
AND TRYING TO MITIGATE THOSE

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:49.771
ISSUES ARE INCREDIBLE SUCCESSES.

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:51.639
AND OBVIOUSLY AT THE L. E. A.

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:54.576
LEVEL. AND THAT THE TEACHER AND

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:56.844
LEARNING LEVEL. TEACHERS ARE

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:58.646
HAPPY FEEL INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:01.616
PRESSURE. TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:02.784
AND I THINK THAT THE MESSAGE

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:04.419
THAT WE'RE HEARING IS WE'RE

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:06.154

LUNCH AND AFTER SCHOOL YOU HAVE-

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:18.566
AND THE NUMBER OF THE--ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.335
THE INSTITUTES OF HIGHER ED. IL

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:21.703
TO STAPLE TEACHING FORCE USING

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:22.670
THEIR STUDENT TEACHERS IN

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:25.607
DIFFERENT WAYS. YOU HAVE A

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:26.975
COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND MULTI AGE

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.409

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:37.051
THINK ABOUT TO THE MITIGATE.

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:38.119
KEEP THE STAFF THEY HAVE. AND

THEY GO FOR. SO WITH THAT BEING

01:27:45.193 --> 01:27:47.362
SAID I THINK THERE ARE JUST.

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:48.663
FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:51.232
THINK- AND PROVIDE THAT THE CCP

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:52.533
WILL BE FOCUSED ON AS WE GO

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.936
FORWARD. ONE IS HELPING ALLEY

01:27:55.003 --> 01:27:56.904
GATES THINK STRATEGICALLY ABOUT

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:58.139
THE CURRENT INITIATIVES THAT ARE

01:27:58.206 --> 01:27:59.907
IN THE PIPELINE YOU HAVE SEVEN.

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.442
STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:03.244
INITIATIVES THAT ARE HIGHLY

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:05.747
FUNDED- REQUIRE INTENSIVE AMOUNT

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:06.781
OF TIME TO THINK YOU KNOW

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:07.949
LEARNING AROUND EVIDENCE BASED

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:09.817
PRACTICES AND INTERVENTIONS. OUR

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:12.120
JOB IS TO HELP TRANSLATE THOSE

FOR COUNTY OFFICES AND ELEAZAR

01:28:13.287 --> 01:28:15.056
THE WAY THAT'S MEANINGFUL. WE

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:16.758
KEEP THE FOCUS ON LEARNING

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:18.526
INSTRUCTION TEACHERS TO SUPPORT

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:21.062

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.598
HOW TO USE. THE RESOURCES AND WE

SOLVE AND HAVE SOLUTIONS. FOR

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:30.505
THE USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS IN A

01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:32.473
WAY THAT ALLOWS THOSE INNOVATIVE

CRITICAL AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:55.089

01:40:05.566 --> 01:40:06.900
ENROLLMENT IT'S A WAY DISTRICTS

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:08.969

WOULD START TO SEE SOME OF THE

01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:06.453
MAJOR REDUCTIONS SO THAT'S NOT.

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.554
THAT'S GOING TO BE A PART RIGHT

01:42:07.621 --> 01:42:08.555
NOW WE DON'T EXPECT THAT THEY

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:10.324

THESE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES I

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:35.943
WOULD ACTUALLY SUGGEST THAT THIS

01:43:36.009 --> 01:43:38.579
IS SOMETHING WORTH LOOKING AT

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:40.013
BUT IT REQUIRES SOME RESEARCH ON

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.715
IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO LEARN

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:42.816
FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE EXPERIENCE

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:44.585

HAD TO DO WITH THE FUNDING AND I

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:51.091
THINK THE RESPONSE FROM MY

01:48:51.157 --> 01:48:53.460
PERSPECTIVE WAS THE CORRECT ONE-

01:48:53.526 --> 01:48:54.828
FROM MR CABRAL THAT IS BUILD

01:48:54.895 --> 01:48:56.563
MORE MONEY INTO THE BASE. EVEN

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.198
MORE MONEY ON GOING MONEY COMES

01:48:58.265 --> 01:49:00.200
IN DON'T SENATE IN NEW PROGRAMS

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:02.002
DON'T RECREATE THE CRAB ROLLS

01:49:02.068 --> 01:49:04.271
CATEGORICAL BUILD IT INTO THE

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:06.673
BASS ALLOCATION UNDER THE LCF IS

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:07.641
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS ONE OF

01:49:07.707 --> 01:49:10.610
THE REASONS WE'RE IN THIS- THE

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:12.012
SITUATION IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

01:49:12.078 --> 01:49:13.914
HAVING FEWER CHILDREN. HEY THERE

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:14.748
ARE GOING TO BE IF YOU WERE

STUDENTS GOING TO CALIFORNIA

01:49:15.949 --> 01:49:16.983
STUDENTS SCHOOLS BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:18.618
ARE HAVING FEWER CHILDREN. AND

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:20.553
THAT'S A VERY LONG TERM-

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:22.188
SITUATION WHICH NEEDS TO BE

01:49:22.255 --> 01:49:25.058
ADDRESSED. SO WITH THAT COMING

01:49:25.125 --> 01:49:25.659
BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:31.097

TALKED ABOUT THE STUDENT THAT

01:49:35.568 --> 01:49:41.074
CLIFF IS- IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT-

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:42.776
EIGHTY EIGHT ENROLLMENT. WE JUST

01:49:42.842 --> 01:49:44.311
HAD A PARTICIPANT EARLIER FROM

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:45.578
ATTENDANCE WORKS TALK ABOUT

01:49:45.645 --> 01:49:51.851
CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM ONE THING.

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:54.487
EARLY OUR KIDS RELATE TO SCHOOL

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:56.890
BLAME IT ON THAT. ROUGH MORNING.

01:49:56.957 --> 01:49:59.059
YES WE ALWAYS DO. AND I GOT A

01:49:59.125 --> 01:50:00.827
LITTLE NOTE SAYING FROM OUR

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:03.396
SCHOOL YOUR KIDS ARE TURKEY SO

01:50:03.463 --> 01:50:04.965
TECHNOLOGY AT ITS BEST RIGHT.

01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:06.766
AND SO IN SOME DISTRICTS OF KIDS

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:08.501
DON'T SHOW UP IN A CALL THE

01:50:08.568 --> 01:50:10.403
PARENTS SHOULD FOCUS AND GET THE

01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:12.505
KID IN SCHOOL ONE. BECAUSE THEY

01:50:12.572 --> 01:50:14.007
MAY LOSE RESOURCES BUT TO THAT

01:50:14.074 --> 01:50:15.675
CAN IS TO BE IN SCHOOL TO HELP

01:50:15.742 --> 01:50:18.445
THAT COULD DO WELL IN LIFE. SO

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:20.280
IF YOU JUST FOCUS ON ENROLLMENT

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:22.649
WILL DISTRICTS GO AND HUSTLE TO

01:50:22.716 --> 01:50:24.718
GET STUDENTS BACKIN SCHOOL. I

01:50:24.784 --> 01:50:25.885
DON'T KNOW I WOULD THINK THAT

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:27.821
THEY THEY SHOULD AND THEY WOULD

01:50:27.887 --> 01:50:29.422
NOW THAT'S THE MORALLY

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:30.690
APPROPRIATE THING TO DO FOR IT

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:32.525
FOR EDUCATORS AND I KNOW THAT

01:50:32.592 --> 01:50:33.693
MOST DISTRICTS YES THEY DO USE

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:35.996
IN ROME AND SO. AS WE THINK WE

01:50:36.062 --> 01:50:37.030
NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT GOING

01:50:37.097 --> 01:50:38.264
FORWARD MAYBE THERE'S A MIDDLE

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:42.736
GROUND THERE SOMETHING- BUT-

WHICH IS KIND OF AN ACUTE ISSUE

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:07.727
RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK WE SHOULD

01:51:07.794 --> 01:51:09.796
FOCUS ON THIS FROM THE LARGE

01:51:09.863 --> 01:51:12.465

PROCEED NOW WITH OUR PANELISTS

01:51:25.678 --> 01:51:28.581
AGAIN LMAO- THICK MAT CINEMA

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:31.017
COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND

01:51:31.084 --> 01:51:36.489
SAN DIEGO UNIFIED. I HAVE. EVER

01:51:36.556 --> 01:51:37.791
WHAT LEAD SINGER OF ANALYST'S

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:40.527
OFFICE GET MAKE IT HAD A THANK

01:51:40.593 --> 01:51:41.961
HAND OUT. A VERY SHORT THAT'S

01:51:42.028 --> 01:51:43.830
CALLED. BASED FUNDING SCHOOLS

01:51:43.897 --> 01:51:44.831
THAT JUST A TWO PAGER THAT WE

01:51:44.898 --> 01:51:46.566
USED TO HAVE TO WALK THROUGH ON

01:51:46.633 --> 01:51:48.334
THE BASICS OF ATTENDANCE AND

01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:50.070
TALK TO OUR- WE APART FROM

01:51:50.136 --> 01:51:51.805
OUTLOOK ASSUMPTIONS. JUST AS A

01:51:51.871 --> 01:51:53.406
POINT OF TO START OFF THE

01:51:53.473 --> 01:51:56.176
CONVERSATION. I'M SO FIRST ON

01:51:56.242 --> 01:51:57.477
PAGE ONE WE TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:51:57.544 --> 01:51:59.979
ABOUT- ATTENDANCE BASED FUNDING

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:01.848
AND HOW IT WORKS IN CALIFORNIA-

01:52:01.915 --> 01:52:02.982
I THINK A LOT OF THIS HAS

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:03.883
ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED SO I'LL

01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:06.519
KEEP IT BRIEF- BUT THE PRIMARY

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:08.421
FUNDING FORMULAS. FOR STATE

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:09.923
FUNDING FORMULA FOR SCHOOLS RELY

01:52:09.989 --> 01:52:11.624
ON ATTENDANCE OUT OF THE WAY TO

01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:12.592
ALLOCATE FUNDING SO THAT

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:15.261
INCLUDES- PRIMARILY WORK MOST

01:52:15.328 --> 01:52:15.995
IMPORTANTLY THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:52:16.062 --> 01:52:17.931
FUNDING FORMULA. BUT ALSO OUR

01:52:17.997 --> 01:52:18.965
SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING

01:52:19.032 --> 01:52:20.667
FORMULA AS WELL. ARAMBULA THE

01:52:20.733 --> 01:52:22.202
PER STUDENT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:24.003
PER STUDENT GRANTS IN IN OUR

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:25.371
PERSON BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSE

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:27.440
IT'S REALLY. BASED ON THE YOU

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:28.641
KNOW PER AVERAGE DAILY

01:52:28.708 --> 01:52:29.742
ATTENDANCE OR ONE UNIT ABOUT

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:37.383
AVERAGE. DAILY ATTENDANCE AND-

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:39.953
ON A STATEWIDE. AND WITH THEM.

01:52:40.019 --> 01:52:41.287
BUT FIVE PER OF STUDENTS WHO.

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:42.755
ARE THERE'S A LOT OF NAY 5%

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.023
ATTENDANCE RATE SO DISTRICTS AS

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:46.192
THE- USUALLY 95% OF THAT AMOUNT

01:52:46.259 --> 01:52:48.695
. I'M BUT BEEN MORE DISCUSSION

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:49.963
ABOUT INDEPENDENT STUDY I MEAN-

01:52:50.029 --> 01:52:51.464
IN THE LAST YEAR BE OF THAT THE

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:53.433
ABOUT PER. FOR FAMILIES WHO DO

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.134
NOT WANT TO BACK TO THE

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:56.803
CLASSROOM- I THINK- WITH MENTOR

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:58.171
HERE THE HEARING BY THE THAT

01:52:58.238 --> 01:52:59.973
ATTENDANCE CALCULATED IS BY-

01:53:00.039 --> 01:53:02.275
THAT. TAKING THE ASSIGNMENT AND

01:53:02.342 --> 01:53:05.145
WORK OUR WORK AT. FINE STUDENTS

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:07.113
AND CA THAT TO A TIE VALUE WORKS

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.582
OF EXAMPLE- THERE'S AN IDEA.

01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:11.684
STEP BY WORTH WEEK WITH AND I

01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:13.786
STUDENTS SUBMIT THAT. THAT'S HOW

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:15.188
THEY RECEIVE ON SO THERE'S A

01:53:15.255 --> 01:53:15.755
VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH BUT

01:53:15.822 --> 01:53:17.490
CONVERTED TO USE OF SOME OF

01:53:17.557 --> 01:53:20.527
EIGHTY EIGHT. I'M SO THAT THAT'S

01:53:20.593 --> 01:53:21.528
- HAS COLLECTED EVERY YEAR FOR

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:23.630
SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'M USUALLY

01:53:23.696 --> 01:53:25.498
GOES THROUGH. THE SPRINGTIME

01:53:25.565 --> 01:53:27.534
TYPICALLY IT'S LIKE APRIL

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:28.701
FIFTEEN THIRTY ONE WHEN

01:53:28.768 --> 01:53:30.537
DISTRICTS STOP COLLECTING ITEMS

01:53:30.603 --> 01:53:31.171
FOR FUNDING PURPOSES AND THAT'S

01:53:31.237 --> 01:53:36.676
USED. TO DETERMINE YOUR

01:53:36.743 --> 01:53:37.343
ALLOCATION AMOUNTS. THE IS A ONE

01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:38.811
YEAR HOW MUCH OF I'M SURE YOU'RE

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:39.913
PER SCHOOL. NOT FOR BECAUSE THE

01:53:39.979 --> 01:53:41.347
SCHOOL THIS IN THE WHOLE

01:53:41.414 --> 01:53:43.116
HARMLESS. I'M ESSENTIALLY A ONE

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:45.585
YOU'RE OFFER IN CASE. I'M PARTY

01:53:45.652 --> 01:53:47.420
FUNDING OF THE- GIVES. AND ONE

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:49.289
YEAR. TO PREPARE FOR THAT ARE.

01:53:49.355 --> 01:53:50.690
THEY THEY KNOW WHAT TENANTS. AND

01:53:50.757 --> 01:53:52.759
THEY CAN THEY CAN- START TO

01:53:52.825 --> 01:53:53.860
BUILD IN THERE BUT IT'S A PLAN

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:54.427
FOR HOW THEY'RE GONNA TRUST

01:53:54.494 --> 01:53:57.830
THOSE REDUCTIONS IN FUNDING.

01:53:57.897 --> 01:53:58.731
DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE

01:53:58.798 --> 01:54:01.000

TWENTY. EIGHTY MEMBERS ARE JUST

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:19.452
USING THAT UP TO. THAT POINT-

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:23.089
THERE WERE A FEW DAYS. AFTER IN

01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:23.623

THERE ARE TWO STUDENTS WERE.

01:54:27.627 --> 01:54:29.262
STAYING HOME SO THAT THAT DATA

PENDANTS THIS YEAR THAN TWENTY

01:55:25.385 --> 01:55:27.920
NINETEEN TWENTY IT'S GOING TO BE

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:28.454
THE EIGHTY THAT'S USED TO

01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:31.824
DETERMINE FUNDING. ON THE SECOND

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:34.927
PAGE WE HAVE- A CHART PICKED HAS

01:55:34.994 --> 01:55:36.496
OUR OUTLOOK ATTENDANCE

01:55:36.562 --> 01:55:37.630
PROJECTIONS AND I THINK WE USE

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:38.164
THESE LOOK MAINLY AT THE

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:39.866
STARTING POINT. FOR FURTHER

01:55:39.932 --> 01:55:42.235
CONVERSATION SO THAT. YOU HAVE

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:43.803
A- YOU CAN VIEW OUR BASELINE

01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:45.204
ASSUMPTIONS ARE AND I'LL TALK A

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:47.874
LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE MAJOR

01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:49.242
UNCERTAINTY AROUND THESE ARE RUN

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:50.510
THESE AND WHAT KIND OF ISSUES

01:55:50.576 --> 01:55:51.511
WE'RE LOOKING AT MOVING FORWARD

01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:52.812
IT'S WORK. HI TRACKING WHAT'S

01:55:52.879 --> 01:55:55.281
GOING ON WITH THE TENDONS. UNDER

01:55:55.348 --> 01:55:57.717
THREE MAJOR DRIVERS OF ABOUT-

01:55:57.784 --> 01:55:59.185
THE CHANGES IN ATTENDANCE IN OUR

01:55:59.252 --> 01:56:00.920
IN OUR OUTLOOK AND THOUGHT. IT

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:01.988
MIGHT BE ABLE TO JUST WALK

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:03.289
THROUGH ALL THE TALK ABOUT HOW

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:04.390
THOSE AFFECT ATTENDANCE OVER THE

01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:06.793
LONG RUN. THE FIRST ADAM AS IT I

01:56:06.859 --> 01:56:08.728
THINK I'M- MISTER DONUT

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:10.363
MENTIONED YEAH IT IS THE-

01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:11.931
DEMOGRAPHIC DECLINES IN THE

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:13.333
SCHOOL AGE POPULATION THIS IS

01:56:13.399 --> 01:56:16.069
SOMETHING THAT. EXIST A PART OF.

01:56:16.135 --> 01:56:17.537
THE PANDEMIC THAT. YOU'RE IN AND

01:56:17.603 --> 01:56:19.539
IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY BY A

01:56:19.605 --> 01:56:20.707
LOWER BIRTH THE CALIFORNIA I

01:56:20.773 --> 01:56:22.775
BELIEVE WE HAD- YOU KNOW

01:56:22.842 --> 01:56:24.811
DECLINES IN BIRTH. SINCE TWO

01:56:24.877 --> 01:56:25.645
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:26.779
SO WE'VE SEEN A LONG STANDING TO

01:56:26.846 --> 01:56:28.681
CLIMB. IN IN A MOMENT

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:30.450
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF BECAUSE

01:56:30.516 --> 01:56:32.919
OF THAT. AND SO UNDER OUR OUR

01:56:32.985 --> 01:56:35.088
FORECAST WE- WE CONTINUE TO

01:56:35.154 --> 01:56:35.988
ASSUME THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:56:36.055 --> 01:56:36.789
A DECLINE IN THE SCHOOL AGE

01:56:36.856 --> 01:56:38.791
POPULATION. AND I WILL RESULT IN

01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:47.100
A REDUCTION BY. TWENTY FIVE

01:56:47.166 --> 01:56:47.667
TWENTY SIX OF A HUNDRED AND

01:56:47.734 --> 01:56:48.301
SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. THE

01:56:48.368 --> 01:56:49.769
FACT. COMPLY THAT IS MORE

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:50.837
UNCERTAIN PEACE AND I THINK A

01:56:50.903 --> 01:56:52.739
BIG PART OF WHAT- EVERYONE IS

01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:54.040
TRYING TO. ON WHAT WHAT WHEN

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:54.674
MEANS IN THE LONG RUN IS THE IF

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:57.577
I. OF THE PANDEMIC ATTENDANCE-

01:56:57.643 --> 01:56:59.445
WHAT WE CALL ON PAN RELATED. IN

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:03.149
THE- WE DO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

01:57:03.216 --> 01:57:03.716
FOR TWENTY TWENTY WE DID NOT

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:04.317
COLLECT EIGHTY EIGHT WE DON'T

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:04.917
HAVE A- TWENTY TWENTY ONE A-

01:57:04.984 --> 01:57:08.154
DATA. WE ALSO- I KNOW THAT THE

01:57:08.221 --> 01:57:09.255
TIME TO WORK THINGS WERE. SOME

01:57:09.322 --> 01:57:11.891
FROM. THERE IS NO STATE. A DATA

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:13.393
YET BUT THERE WILL BE SOME

01:57:13.459 --> 01:57:15.261
PRELIMINARY DATA. RIGHT RIGHT

01:57:15.328 --> 01:57:16.529
THE DEPARTMENT USUALLY MAKES

01:57:16.596 --> 01:57:19.799
PUBLIC. IN LATE FEBRUARY. EARLY

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:21.334
MARCH. THAT WILL GIVE US A SENSE

01:57:21.401 --> 01:57:24.070
OF STATEWIDE- EIGHTY EIGHT BUT

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:25.471
WE DON'T HAVE THAT YET WE ALSO

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:27.540
DON'T HAVE- STATEWIDE ENROLLMENT

01:57:27.607 --> 01:57:29.909
OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE- DISTRICT

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:31.144
HAVE COLLECTED IT BECAUSE

01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:33.146
OCTOBER WITH THE FROM TO STATE-

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:34.947
BUT THAT'S NOT BEEN. CLEANED UP

01:57:35.014 --> 01:57:36.382
BY THE DEPARTMENT AND IT MADE

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:37.417
PUBLICSO WITHOUT THAT WE DON'T

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:38.584
HAVE ANY SPECIFIC TWENTY ONE

01:57:38.651 --> 01:57:41.087
THIRTY TWO- INFORMATION. TO GET

01:57:41.154 --> 01:57:43.055
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE TWENTY TWENTY

01:57:43.122 --> 01:57:43.723
ONE EIGHTY EIGHTY THE ONLY THING

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:45.124
WE HAVE IS. FROM THE PANDEMIC

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:46.793
STATEWIDE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:57:46.859 --> 01:57:48.428
IN MOMENT SO. LOOKING AT THE

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:50.496
DATA WE DIDN'T SEE A TWO AND A

01:57:50.563 --> 01:57:50.997
HALF PERCENT DECLINE IN

01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:53.166
ENROLLMENT- WHICH IS MUCH BIGGER

01:57:53.232 --> 01:57:55.401
THAN. DEMOGRAPHICALLY DRIVEN

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:56.469
DECLINES OF RECENT YEARS

01:57:56.536 --> 01:57:57.937
TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE.

01:57:58.004 --> 01:57:59.439
YOU KNOW I TENTH OF A PERCENTAGE

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:02.642
POINT DECLINE- SO. WHAT WE HAVE

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:03.576
ASSUME THAT THAT IS A CRITICAL

01:58:03.643 --> 01:58:05.845
THE NINETEEN RELATED DECLINE AND

01:58:05.912 --> 01:58:07.513
WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE IN HOME

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.415
AND THE CLIENTS THEY ARE IN.

01:58:09.482 --> 01:58:11.751
ABOUT 40% OF THE DECLINE IN THE

01:58:11.818 --> 01:58:13.719
MOMENT. COMES FROM T. K. AND

01:58:13.786 --> 01:58:15.655
KINDERGARTEN. AND AGAIN THESE

01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:16.989
ARE STATEWIDE NUMBER SO IT

01:58:17.056 --> 01:58:18.591
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT REFLECTING

01:58:18.658 --> 01:58:20.760
SORT OF STUDENTS. MOVING FROM

01:58:20.827 --> 01:58:21.828
ONE DISTRICT TO ANOTHER BECAUSE

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:22.829
OTHERWISE IT WAS A SHOPPING

01:58:22.895 --> 01:58:24.997
DISTRICTS- ENROLLMENT AND NOT IN

01:58:25.064 --> 01:58:26.466
OTHERS. THE REFLECT THE OVERALL

01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:27.867
JUST FEWER STUDENTS IN THAT

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:29.869
SYSTEM NOW. WE'VE ALSO LOOKED AT

01:58:29.936 --> 01:58:32.071
OTHER DATA LIKE- PRIVATE SCHOOL

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:34.373
AND HOMESCHOOL ENROLLMENT- AND

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.143
PUT. THE LITTLE INFORMATION THAT

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:39.779
WE HAVE AVAILABLE ON MIGRATION-

01:58:39.846 --> 01:58:48.821
IN AND OUT OF THE STATE. NONE OF

01:58:48.888 --> 01:58:49.455
THOSE THINGS SUGGEST THAT EITHER

01:58:49.522 --> 01:58:50.022
OUR STUDENTS ARE FEELING THE

01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:51.090
PUBLIC SYSTEM. OR THEY ARE MORE

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:52.692
OUT OF STATE. SO ARE SOME

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:54.660
SENIORS THAT DOES. ARE PARENTS

01:58:54.727 --> 01:58:55.528
WHO DECIDE THAT THEY DON'T. TO

01:58:55.595 --> 01:58:57.430
PUT THEIR KIDS IN. A CAN OCCUR.

01:58:57.497 --> 01:58:57.997
WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO BE A

01:58:58.064 --> 01:59:00.633
PRIMARY- IN REMOTE. ON WE KNOW.

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.168
THE OCTOBER MOMENT THERE THAT WE

01:59:02.235 --> 01:59:04.337
HAVE IS JUST. POINT TIME- DURING

01:59:04.403 --> 01:59:06.205
SOME THIS. COURT YOU MILITARY.

01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:07.907
YOU SEE HOW WHAT A MOMENT LOOKS

01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:08.774
BY THE END OF THE YEAR THAT

01:59:08.841 --> 01:59:09.842
THERE THAT WOULD. HEALTHCARE SO

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:10.977
WE'RE NOT SURE HOW MUCH LISTED

01:59:11.043 --> 01:59:13.112
IN. CAME FOR ABOUT WHEN SOME

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:13.946
SCHOOLS OPEN THE SPRING BUT

01:59:14.013 --> 01:59:14.947

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:24.524
IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT HOW

01:59:30.563 --> 01:59:32.398
LEAD THEM SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:11.744
WE SPOKE ON ALL INPUT. THAT WE

02:04:11.811 --> 02:04:13.112
BRING THESE ARE. TO LIGHT WAYS

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:14.747
THAT ARE SUPPORTER OF CHILL.

02:04:14.814 --> 02:04:16.415
FAMILIES EDUC AND SCHOOLS THAT

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:17.883
WE REMOVE. BARRIERS THAT MIGHT

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:21.453
STAND IN THE WAY OF SUCCESS AND

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.588
WE ARE MAKING HEADWAY IN

02:04:22.655 --> 02:04:24.390
PROGRESS WE'RE BEGINNING TO

02:04:24.456 --> 02:04:27.026
BUILD BACK BETTER- SO WE WANT TO

02:04:27.092 --> 02:04:29.628
BE SRE THAT WE'RE- STRATEGIC IN

02:04:29.695 --> 02:04:32.164
HOW WE APPROACH. THIS YEAR ALL

02:04:32.231 --> 02:04:33.399
OF THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT WE'RE

02:04:33.465 --> 02:04:34.834
EXPERIENCING THAT I KNOW YOU'VE

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:36.836
BEEN HEARING ABOUT- THE

02:04:36.902 --> 02:04:38.337
UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT ENROLLMENTS

02:04:38.404 --> 02:04:39.605
FOR EXAMPLE OR NATIONAL

02:04:39.672 --> 02:04:41.907
PHENOMENON- OF. FUNCTIONING

02:04:41.974 --> 02:04:44.009
CALIFORNIA DECLINING BIRTH RATES

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:45.744
THAT WERE ALREADY UNDER WAY

02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:47.780
STATE MIGRATION TO THE COST OF

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:49.615
HOUSING AS WELL AS THE PANDEMIC

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:52.852
SOME HAD THE ABILITY GROUPS- BUT

02:04:52.918 --> 02:04:54.653
ALSO IN HOUSEHOLDS HIT WITH

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:56.388
INCOME AND SECURITY. SOME YOUNG

02:04:56.455 --> 02:04:57.923
PEOPLE HAD TO GO TO WORK OR CARE

02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:59.725
FOR YOUNGER SIBLINGS SO THAT

02:04:59.792 --> 02:05:01.493
THEIR PARENTS COULD WORK. BUT AS

02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:02.528
WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

02:05:02.595 --> 02:05:04.697
SCHOOL YEAR MANY FAMILIES WANT

02:05:04.763 --> 02:05:05.364
TO RETURN TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:06.899
ARE SAFE. WELCOMING AND

02:05:06.966 --> 02:05:08.634
SUPPORTIVE SOMEONE TO RETURN

02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:10.069
VIRTUALLY BECAUSE THE REMOTE

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:11.704
LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IS ACTUALLY

02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:12.972
WORKING WELL FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:13.873
BUT THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO

02:05:13.939 --> 02:05:15.741
DEPEND ON MANY VARIABLES

02:05:15.808 --> 02:05:17.810
INCLUDING OF BOTH THE COURSE OF

02:05:17.877 --> 02:05:19.411
THE PANDEMIC AND THE DEGREE TO

02:05:19.478 --> 02:05:21.013
WHICH PUBLIC SCHOOL OPTIONS ARE

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.015
MADE APPEALING. TO PARENTS AND

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:26.418
FAMILIES. I JUST WANNA- AS I

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:27.453
MENTIONED BEFORE POINTS ARE

02:05:27.519 --> 02:05:29.521
GOING TO MAKE- I WANT TO MENTION

02:05:29.588 --> 02:05:30.956
THAT ALSO THE BILL BACK BETTER

02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:33.259
ACT. WHICH HAS PASSED THE HOUSE.

02:05:33.325 --> 02:05:35.794
WELL IT IS COMING TO THE SENATE

02:05:35.861 --> 02:05:38.397
IN WASHINGTON DC I INCLUDES AN

02:05:38.464 --> 02:05:39.698
ADDITION TO OUR T. K.

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:42.101
INVESTMENTS FOR THE COMING YEAR.

02:05:42.167 --> 02:05:43.636
FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:05:43.702 --> 02:05:45.404
SUPPORT FOR STATES FOR CHILD

02:05:45.471 --> 02:05:47.907
CARE AND UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL FOR

02:05:47.973 --> 02:05:49.708
THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS SO AS

02:05:49.775 --> 02:05:50.843
WE THINK ABOUT HER MOMENTS WERE

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:52.544
THINKING ON THE ONE HAND. ABOUT

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:53.812
THE FLUCTUATIONS AND SOME TO

02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:55.714
CLIENTS BUT ALSO THE VERY

02:05:55.781 --> 02:05:58.550
SUBSTANTIAL ONRAMP. FOR FOUR

02:05:58.617 --> 02:05:59.952
YEAR OLDS AND UNIVERSAL TICE IN

02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:01.787
CALIFORNIA AND FOR THREE YEAR

02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:08.427
OLDS THAT WILL. BE SUPPORTED BY-

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:09.662
FOR FUNDS. AS WELL AS THE STATE

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.230
FUNDS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THIS

02:06:11.297 --> 02:06:12.765
TO. ALTHOUGH YOUNG PEOPLE SWELL

02:06:12.831 --> 02:06:14.867
WITH PRIDE LAST IN YOUR TO COME

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:17.102
. SO WHAT CAN WE DO- JUST ARE

02:06:17.169 --> 02:06:18.604
FACED TO LET AS YOU KNOW WITH

02:06:18.671 --> 02:06:21.874
THESE CHEN. TO ROMANS WEAR STAFF

02:06:21.941 --> 02:06:22.474
. EVEN IN THE MIDST OF SHORE.

02:06:22.541 --> 02:06:25.044
THAT MAKE. STAFF SO HARD TO FIND

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:26.912
DO WE CLOSE SCHOOL BUILDINGS

02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:28.480
EVEN IF THAT EXACERBATES OUR

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:30.115
MOMENT PROBLEMS. BECAUSE

02:06:30.182 --> 02:06:33.052
DISAPPOINTED PARENTS COULD LEAVE

02:06:33.118 --> 02:06:35.220
. YOU AS WE EXPECT PRESCHOOL

02:06:35.287 --> 02:06:37.122
ENROLLMENTS TO FIND WE NEED TO

02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:38.390
THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM BOTH IN

02:06:38.457 --> 02:06:39.992
TERMS OF THE SHORT TERM ISSUES.

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:42.194
OF THE DESTRUCTION AND THE LONG

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:43.662
TRADITION. OF SUPPORTING

02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:45.397
LEARNING RECOVERY AND DEVELOPING

02:06:45.464 --> 02:06:47.333
A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR ALL OUR

02:06:47.399 --> 02:06:49.101
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SO

02:06:49.168 --> 02:06:51.503
THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT. ARE

02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:53.672
ON THE AGENDA I THINK BUT TO DO

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:55.441
FIRST IN TERMS OF SMOOTHING THE

02:06:55.507 --> 02:06:58.377
PATH. TO THE FUTURE- WE KNOW

02:06:58.444 --> 02:07:01.046
THAT- IT'S- UP TO STATES ALL

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:02.614
OVER THE COUNTRY ARE FINDING

02:07:02.681 --> 02:07:04.450
WAYS AS AS WE UNDOUBTEDLY WELL

02:07:04.516 --> 02:07:06.752
TO SMOOTH. THAT PATH OF OUR

02:07:06.819 --> 02:07:08.487
RECENT INVESTMENTS ARE PROVIDED

02:07:08.554 --> 02:07:10.522
A SHORT TERM QUESTION. A WHILE

02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:12.157
ENROLLMENT ADJUSTMENTS BECOME

02:07:12.224 --> 02:07:14.059
CLEARER AND FOR THOSE DISTRICTS

02:07:14.126 --> 02:07:15.194
THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:16.729
INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOMEONE I'VE

02:07:16.795 --> 02:07:17.763
TALKED TO A NUMBER OF.

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:19.431
SUPERINTENDENTS OF LARGE

02:07:19.498 --> 02:07:22.801
DISTRICTS. WHO WOULD OF BE IN A

02:07:22.868 --> 02:07:24.636
POSITION TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND

02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:26.405
PRESCHOOL PROGRAMMING EFFECTS

02:07:26.472 --> 02:07:27.940
INCENTIVIZED TO CREATE THAT

02:07:28.007 --> 02:07:30.442
EARLY ON RAMP TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

02:07:30.509 --> 02:07:32.411
I THINK THAT I THINK IS

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:34.480
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO USE TIME

02:07:34.546 --> 02:07:38.417
AND RESOURCES. STRATEGICALLY

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:39.918
RIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO.

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:42.354
USE THE HUGE OF ONE TIME. FOR

02:07:42.421 --> 02:07:44.523
THE FEDERAL. AS AS THE STATE TO

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.325
ENABLE THE COHORT OF STUDENTS TO

02:07:46.392 --> 02:07:48.694
CATCH UP AND ACCELERATE. WE'RE

02:07:48.761 --> 02:07:50.095
ALREADY SEEING LEARNING GAINS

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:52.031
OCCURRING THIS FALL IN MANY

02:07:52.097 --> 02:07:54.600
DISTRICTS- BUT IT WILL NOT WORK

02:07:54.666 --> 02:07:55.901
FOR MOST TEACHERS TO LOOK IT UP

02:07:55.968 --> 02:07:57.169
ALL THE GRADE LEVEL STANDARDS

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:58.804
AND MARCH THROUGH THEM. WITH THE

02:07:58.871 --> 02:08:00.706
STRICT PACING GUIDE AND EXPECT

02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:02.241
THAT TO WORK FOR MOST OF THEIR

02:08:02.307 --> 02:08:04.076
STUDENTS. SO SEVERAL THINGS ARE

02:08:04.143 --> 02:08:05.744
GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR USING

02:08:05.811 --> 02:08:08.347
TIME STRATEGICALLY. A ONE IS TO

02:08:08.414 --> 02:08:10.182
REALLY FOCUS ON TEACHING THE BIG

02:08:10.249 --> 02:08:12.017
IDEAS AND THE CONTENT AREAS AND

02:08:12.084 --> 02:08:13.752
USING TECHNOLOGY TO LEVERAGE

02:08:13.819 --> 02:08:15.754
GREATER LEARNING. LAST YEAR WHEN

02:08:15.821 --> 02:08:17.289
THE PANDEMIC HIT THE LEGISLATURE

02:08:17.356 --> 02:08:18.991
ASKED THE STATE BOARD TO DEVELOP

02:08:19.058 --> 02:08:20.759
GUIDANCE USING TECHNOLOGY

02:08:20.826 --> 02:08:22.461
EFFECTIVELY TO TEACH THE MOST

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:24.396
CRITICAL STANDARDS AND LITERACY

02:08:24.463 --> 02:08:26.665
AND MATH. AND WE HAVE A JUST

02:08:26.732 --> 02:08:28.600
RECENTLY SENT AN INCREDIBLY

02:08:28.667 --> 02:08:30.369
HELPFUL THE SOURCE TO THE FIELD

02:08:30.436 --> 02:08:32.604
THAT DOES EXACTLY THAT OUTLINES

02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:34.406
THE BIG IDEAS IN THE CALIFORNIA

02:08:34.473 --> 02:08:35.707
STANDARDS OF RESOURCES FOR

02:08:35.774 --> 02:08:38.110
TEACHING THEM. AND DOCUMENTS THE

02:08:38.177 --> 02:08:40.245
BEST USES OF TECHNOLOGY TOOLS-

02:08:40.312 --> 02:08:42.681
AND I'M ALREADY GETTING FEEDBACK

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:44.583
FROM EDUCATORS AROUND THE STATE

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:45.984
OTHER THAT'S HELPING THEM THINK

02:08:46.051 --> 02:08:48.220
ABOUT HOW TO USE THEIR TIME.

02:08:48.287 --> 02:08:50.222
MORE EFFECTIVELY AND THEIR TOOLS

02:08:50.289 --> 02:08:52.491
MORE EFFECTIVELY. THE THING IS

02:08:52.558 --> 02:08:54.093
THAT WE CAN CREATE A SENSE OF

02:08:54.159 --> 02:08:56.261
INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. THAT MEET

02:08:56.328 --> 02:08:57.563
STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE AND

02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:59.531
ACCELERATE THEIR PROGRESS OF THE

02:08:59.598 --> 02:09:01.433
BENEFITS OF HIGH INTENSITY

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.335
DURING ONE TO ONE OR IN SMALL

02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:06.371
GROUPS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE ONE

02:09:06.438 --> 02:09:08.740
TUTORS ARE WELL TRAINED- AND

02:09:08.807 --> 02:09:10.109
THOSE CAN BE TEACHERS OR PARA

02:09:10.175 --> 02:09:11.977
PROFESSIONALS. THERE'S A BIG

02:09:12.044 --> 02:09:14.179
LITERATURE ON THIS NOW ON PAGE

02:09:14.246 --> 02:09:15.747
FOUR OF MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY

02:09:15.814 --> 02:09:17.850
THAT I HOPE YOU HAVE. IN FRONT

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:20.686
OF YOU YOU CAN SEE THAT. WE HAVE

02:09:20.752 --> 02:09:22.888
VERY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF HOW

02:09:22.955 --> 02:09:24.957
TO ACHIEVE LARGE GAINS ARE FOR

02:09:25.023 --> 02:09:26.692
STRUGGLING READERS OFF FOR

02:09:26.758 --> 02:09:28.327
STUDENTS WHO NEED TO CATCH UP IN

02:09:28.393 --> 02:09:31.096
MATHEMATICS- FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:09:31.163 --> 02:09:32.998
LAST TEN YEARS. EVERY DAY IN

02:09:33.065 --> 02:09:35.134
CALIFORNIA INCLUDING DURING THIS

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.870
LAST YEAR THE PANDEMIC FOUNDER

02:09:37.936 --> 02:09:39.538
STRUGGLING READERS DOUBLE THE

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:42.374
GAINS I ALMOST FORGOT TO THE

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:43.609
AVERAGE READER IN JUST A

02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:52.784
SEMESTER. OF FOCUSED ATTENTION-

02:09:52.851 --> 02:09:54.520
THERE'S A SPANISH SPEAKING. OF

02:09:54.586 --> 02:09:57.256
THAT PROGRAM TO BE HANDLED

02:09:57.322 --> 02:09:58.690
WRAPPED WHICH HAS HAD SO A PRESS

02:09:58.757 --> 02:10:00.959
GAINS. A. I. R. SAID THAT IT

02:10:01.026 --> 02:10:02.561
PRODUCED IN OF A MAN WHICH

02:10:02.628 --> 02:10:05.164
RARELY SEEN EDUCATE FROM. OF ANY

02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:06.832
. ARE WE- RESOURCES THAT YOU L.

02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:08.934
LAST YEAR THE BUDGET. A TWO

02:10:09.001 --> 02:10:11.170
POINT PROFESSIONALS. FOR THE

02:10:11.236 --> 02:10:12.738
MORNING RECOVERY PROGRAM. I

02:10:12.804 --> 02:10:14.540
ENCOUNTERED A THAT UNIVERSE SO

02:10:14.606 --> 02:10:17.009
ALL JUST. CAN OUT HOW TO GET

02:10:17.075 --> 02:10:18.377
PARA PROFESSIONALS AND TEACHERS

02:10:18.443 --> 02:10:20.946
TRAINED UP TO VERY VERY

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:23.482
PRECISELY. PICKUP WHERE STUDENTS

02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:25.417
ARE AN ACCELERATE THEIR

02:10:25.484 --> 02:10:28.320
PROGRESS- AND WE I HAVE REASON

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:30.222
TO BELIEVE THAT THAT SB-

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:31.690
ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN MANY

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:33.458
DISTRICTS ARE DOING THAT. WHAT

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:35.527
THEIR FEDERAL FUNDS AND WITH THE

02:10:35.594 --> 02:10:36.228
FUNDS THAT HAVE COME FROM

02:10:36.295 --> 02:10:38.664
WORKING RECOVERY FROM THE STATE.

02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:40.532
WE ALSO CAN BE INVESTING IN

02:10:40.599 --> 02:10:42.067
SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING IT

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:43.802
SUPPORTS AS MANY DISTRICTS ARE

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:46.071
DOING AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH

02:10:46.138 --> 02:10:47.673
RESOURCES- AND WE KNOW THAT

02:10:47.739 --> 02:10:49.408
THESE WILL IMPROVE BOTH BEHAVIOR

02:10:49.474 --> 02:10:51.777
AND ACHIEVEMENT. NOT ONLY IN THE

02:10:51.843 --> 02:10:53.812
MOMENT BUT OVER THE LONG HAUL OF

02:10:53.879 --> 02:10:54.846
FROM THE RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN

02:10:54.913 --> 02:10:58.617
DONE. AND SO WE- THAT'S A PLACE

02:10:58.684 --> 02:11:00.052
THAT WE CAN INVEST THAT WILL

02:11:00.118 --> 02:11:02.020
TRANSFORM LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS

02:11:02.087 --> 02:11:03.855
IN SCHOOLS. AND THE LIVES OF THE

02:11:03.922 --> 02:11:05.924
STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE THOSE

02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:08.460
PROGRAMS AND VIOLATE TO INVEST

02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:10.729
INTENSELY. IN STAFF RECRUITMENT

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:11.897
RETENTION AND TRAINING TO

THE MODERN FORM OF ORGANIZATION

02:14:19.684 --> 02:14:21.520

02:14:21.586 --> 02:14:23.622
HOW TEACHERS WERE TO BE TESTED.

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:25.056
HOW CHILDREN WERE TO BE TESTED

02:14:25.123 --> 02:14:27.159
TRACKED AND TREATED. THEY WERE

02:14:27.225 --> 02:14:29.661
NOT PARTICULARLY DESIGNED FOR

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:31.797
CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR TWENTY

02:14:31.863 --> 02:14:32.964

IRAQ EDUCATORS HAVE BEEN PUSHING

02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:40.372
ON THE EDGES OF THIS INHERITANCE

02:14:40.439 --> 02:14:43.108
SYSTEM. FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:44.676
THESE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE OLD

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:46.077
MODELS ARE DEEPLY INGRAINED IN

02:14:46.144 --> 02:14:47.546
OUR SYSTEMS THAT WE'VE

02:14:47.612 --> 02:14:49.681
INHERITED. AND THEY DO INFLUENCE

02:14:49.748 --> 02:14:51.783
THINGS ABOUT HOW WE ORGANIZE

02:14:51.850 --> 02:14:54.419
CLASSROOMS STEPPING STEEP TIME

02:14:54.486 --> 02:14:56.221
TEACHING TEXTBOOKS AND TESTING.

US SO WE'RE HEARING FROM A LOT

02:14:58.623 --> 02:15:00.692
OF DISRICTS THAT WANT TO REALLY

SCHOOLS A USING CHECK. OF FOR.

02:15:09.734 --> 02:15:10.969
ALL ALL MORE AND MORE WHERE IT'S

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:12.637
APPROACH. OF WHERE THEY- FOR

02:15:12.704 --> 02:15:14.706
EXAMPLE STOOD. BLENDING ALL OR

02:15:14.773 --> 02:15:18.777
WITH A JOKE COURSES- ALONGSIDE

APPRENTICESHIPS AND INTERNSHIPS

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:24.983
ARE THEY MIGHT DO THOSE THINGS-

02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:26.518
IN ONE DAY OR IN SEVERAL DAYS

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:27.853

OF TIME AND SPACE FOR LEARNING.

02:15:45.203 --> 02:15:46.605

IT DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS OF

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.008

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:17.609
DISTRICTS WITH TWO CONSECUTIVE

02:20:17.675 --> 02:20:19.844
YEARS OF ROBERT KLEIN'S AND NOT

FUNDING CLIP AND IT'S BEEN

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:36.027
REFERRED TO EARLIER THIS

02:20:36.094 --> 02:20:38.730
MORNING. IN OTHER COMICS. I'M

02:20:38.797 --> 02:20:40.799
NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR SIMPLY

DELAYING THE IMPACT BY ADDING

02:20:43.334 --> 02:20:45.637
ANOTHER YEAR HOLD HARMLESS BUT I

02:20:45.703 --> 02:20:48.106
AM AN ADVOCATE FOR CHANGING THE

WORKERS TAKES ABOUT CLIP. LOOK

02:20:50.542 --> 02:20:53.745
MORE LIKE A GRADUAL SLOPE AND I

02:20:53.812 --> 02:20:57.315
THINK THAT CAN BE DONE

02:20:57.382 --> 02:20:58.750
RELATIVELY EASILY. ON THE SHORT

02:20:58.817 --> 02:21:00.485
TERM THERE ARE NOT FISCAL EQUITY

02:21:00.552 --> 02:21:02.320
FOR THIS RESULTING THE DECLINE

02:21:02.387 --> 02:21:05.957
IN ROME. WELL THE A. O. AND OF

02:21:06.024 --> 02:21:07.458
FINANCE CAN SPEAK TO THIS WITH

02:21:07.525 --> 02:21:10.161
MORE. THE STATE IS PART TO

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:13.898
REMAIN A PROBLEM I EIGHT ONE. WE

02:21:13.965 --> 02:21:15.166
GUARANTEE IS NOW IN BY A

02:21:15.233 --> 02:21:20.305
DECREASE. IN CASE LOWER. AS SUCH

02:21:20.371 --> 02:21:22.507
MINIMUM CARE TO YOU GROW DESPITE

02:21:22.574 --> 02:21:24.576
THE DECREASING EIGHTY EIGHT.

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:25.944
THIS PROVIDES THE ADMINISTRATION

02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:28.413
A LEGISLATURE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:21:28.479 --> 02:21:30.615
FIND EIGHTY A HIGHER RATES OR

INVESTING IN MITIGATION

02:21:32.383 --> 02:21:35.787
STRATEGY. THAT SUPPORTS A

02:21:35.854 --> 02:21:37.388
GRADUAL SLOPE. A FUNDING

02:21:37.455 --> 02:21:39.991
IMPACTED A LOCAL LEVEL. AS

02:21:40.058 --> 02:21:42.427
OPPOSED TO THE DEVASTATING CLIP

02:21:42.493 --> 02:21:45.430
IT'S FINALLY FORECAST. I'M A

02:21:45.496 --> 02:21:47.465
LONG TERM DEPENDING ON A VARIETY

02:21:47.532 --> 02:21:49.100
OF FACTORS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

02:21:56.407 --> 02:21:59.143
WOULD BE A CONSIDERATION THE

IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL

02:22:01.813 --> 02:22:03.848
DISTRICTS EXPERIENCING DECLINES

02:22:03.915 --> 02:22:05.617
ARE SIGNIFICANT. BUT USE A

02:22:05.683 --> 02:22:06.918
SIMPLE SCENARIO TO ILLUSTRATE

02:22:06.985 --> 02:22:09.487
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL

02:22:09.554 --> 02:22:11.522

OF TWENTY FOUR TO ONE. THE LOST

02:22:19.530 --> 02:22:23.668
REVENUE APPROXIMATES. ONE POINT

02:22:23.735 --> 02:22:25.803
TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE

MAXIMUM NUMBER TEACHERS TO

02:22:28.273 --> 02:22:31.309

HUNDRED NINETY THREE THOUSAND.

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:36.547
ADD A FEW DOLLARS PER STUDENT

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:38.750
FOR SUPPLIES AND A POTENTIAL

02:22:38.816 --> 02:22:40.852
EXPENDITURE SAVINGS WOULD ONLY

02:22:40.919 --> 02:22:43.554
BE ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY

02:22:43.621 --> 02:22:45.089
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR JUST THIRTY

02:22:45.156 --> 02:22:47.759
SIX CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF

A HUNDRED AND TWENTY STUDENTS

02:22:53.364 --> 02:22:56.167
ARE TO SAY GREAT SPACE YEAH AND

02:22:56.234 --> 02:22:57.902
AT THE SAME SCHOOL. MORE

02:22:57.969 --> 02:22:59.570
REALISTIC WOULD BE TO SPREAD

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:00.838
THOSE HUNDRED TWENTY STUDENTS

02:23:00.905 --> 02:23:02.507

02:23:02.573 --> 02:23:04.475
MULTIPLE SCHOOLS AND WHEN YOU DO

02:23:04.542 --> 02:23:06.344
DOUBT THERE IS NO PRACTICAL

IMPACT. ON TEACHERS STAFFING

02:23:08.313 --> 02:23:10.281

REVENUE LOSS. IN THE SHORT TERM

02:23:23.695 --> 02:23:24.662

02:30:59.183 --> 02:31:00.785
ACTUALLY HAS ABOUT A THOUSAND

02:31:00.851 --> 02:31:03.821

HAPPENS TO OUR KIDS. THIS IS

02:31:59.009 --> 02:32:00.744
ANOTHER CHART WAS DONE RECENTLY

02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:02.613
HI THIS IS A SMALLER GROUP OF

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:04.448
STUDENTS FROM ONE ELEMENTARY

02:32:04.515 --> 02:32:06.383
SCHOOL IN WEST SENECA COUNTY AND

THAT WAS IMPACTED BY BOTH FIRES

02:32:08.652 --> 02:32:10.387
AND FLOODS AND COOK AT NINETEEN.

02:32:10.454 --> 02:32:12.389
ON IN REGARDS TO COULD NINETEEN

02:32:12.456 --> 02:32:13.591
THIS PARTICULAR AYE TWENTY

02:32:13.657 --> 02:32:15.326
QUESTIONS I START WAS ADJUSTED

02:32:15.392 --> 02:32:16.527
TO INCLUDE THOSE QUESTIONS WE

02:32:16.594 --> 02:32:19.797
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT- SO FOR

02:32:19.864 --> 02:32:22.066
EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT. THE

02:32:22.132 --> 02:32:23.133
FIRST ONE TO THE STUDENTS ARE

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:25.669
SCARED TO HELP LIST- DID YOU

02:32:25.736 --> 02:32:27.571
HAVE TO EVACUATE THIS PARTICULAR

02:32:27.638 --> 02:32:29.073
ON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YOU CAN SEE

02:32:29.139 --> 02:32:30.641
THAT 70% OF THE CHILDREN WERE

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:33.344
EVACUATED ON AND THIS AS I

02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:35.713
MENTIONED THE QUESTIONS OF THIS

02:32:35.779 --> 02:32:36.881
PARTICULAR SCREENER CAN BE

02:32:36.947 --> 02:32:40.184
ADJUSTED. TO WHAT'S GOING ON- WE

02:32:40.251 --> 02:32:41.685
COULD ADJUST THE QUESTIONS TO

02:32:41.752 --> 02:32:42.920
THINGS LIKE SCHOOL CLOSURE

02:32:42.987 --> 02:32:45.890
DECLINING ENROLLMENT WILL ALSO

02:32:45.956 --> 02:32:47.958
FEATURE- THERE WERE PARTICULARLY

02:32:48.025 --> 02:32:49.760
. CONCERNED IN OUR COUNTY ABOUT

02:32:49.827 --> 02:32:51.762
SCHOOL CLOSURES ULTIMATELY OVER

02:32:51.829 --> 02:32:53.764
THE NEXT TEN YEARS TEACHER

02:32:53.831 --> 02:32:56.300
LAYOFFS. AND WHAT THIS WILL DO

02:32:56.367 --> 02:32:58.002
TO THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE

02:32:58.068 --> 02:33:00.771
CHILDREN FEEL WITH THEIR SCHOOL

02:33:00.838 --> 02:33:08.512
SCHOOL CLIMATE SCHOOL CULTURE.

02:33:08.579 --> 02:33:11.282
SO THIS IS A VERY- MUCH SMALLER

02:33:11.348 --> 02:33:13.284
GROUP AGAIN AND WE CAN LOOK HERE

02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:15.352
THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE

02:33:15.419 --> 02:33:16.287
STUDENTS ARE PARTICULARLY

02:33:16.353 --> 02:33:18.422
IMPACTED THIS HELPS US TO DIRECT

02:33:18.489 --> 02:33:20.791
OUR RESOURCES AGAIN- I WILL SHOW

02:33:20.858 --> 02:33:22.593
THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE DOWN FOCUS

02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:24.929

GEO MAP. THE DATA THAT WE-

02:33:38.809 --> 02:33:40.377
DRAWDOWN BASED ON THIS

02:33:40.444 --> 02:33:43.447
PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT. SO WE CAN

02:33:43.514 --> 02:33:47.585
SEE THAT OF THE SCHOOLS THAT ON

02:33:47.651 --> 02:33:48.786
THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE BASED ON.

02:33:48.852 --> 02:33:50.621
WE'VE GOT A 100% OF THE KIDS

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:51.956
THAT HAVE SOME INDICATOR THAT

02:33:52.022 --> 02:33:54.925
SEND THE BREAD- WE CAN LOOK AT

02:33:54.992 --> 02:33:56.493
THE ONE SCHOOL AND I UP AND

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:58.629
REMOVE THE SCHOOL NAMES- BUT-

WHERE WE DO HAVE SOME STUDENTS

02:34:02.533 --> 02:34:04.168
THAT ARE FUNCTIONING AND AGREED-

02:34:04.234 --> 02:34:06.236
BUT IF WE WERE. DOING THE DATA

02:34:06.303 --> 02:34:08.339
FOR THE WHOLE COUNTY THEN FROM

02:34:08.405 --> 02:34:10.541
WILL COUNTY OFF PERSPECTIVE AND

02:34:10.608 --> 02:34:12.176
A PARTICULARLY FOR A LARGER

SCHOOLS HAVE. THE HIGHEST

02:34:20.117 --> 02:34:22.353
INDICATORS OF NEED AND THEN THAT

02:42:28.438 --> 02:42:30.373
SUB THAT THAT WERE FROM MY LIFE

02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:32.075
. AND OUR GOVERNOR THANK YOU SO

02:42:32.142 --> 02:42:34.845
MUCH. IN TERMS OF OUR- DECLINING

02:42:34.911 --> 02:42:36.012
ENROLLMENT AND FISCAL

02:42:36.079 --> 02:42:38.348
IMPLICATIONS I WILL SAY THAT

02:42:38.415 --> 02:42:40.117
THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM AND MR

02:42:40.183 --> 02:42:43.053
CABRAL MENTION THIS IT'S PAST

02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:46.256
MONEY. I'M THAT. THIS IS NOT NEW

02:42:46.323 --> 02:42:47.991
BY THE EXACERBATED BY THE

02:42:48.058 --> 02:42:50.460
PANDEMIC. IN THE SEVEN YEARS

02:42:50.527 --> 02:42:53.597
PRIOR TO- THE PANDEMIC- STARTING

02:42:53.663 --> 02:42:56.967
IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. WE SAW

02:42:57.033 --> 02:42:58.935
DECLINING ENROLLMENT- AND ON

02:42:59.002 --> 02:43:02.038
AVERAGE- WE WERE SAYING LESS

02:43:02.105 --> 02:43:05.509
THAN ONE PERCENT. IN TERMS OF

02:43:05.575 --> 02:43:09.813
AVERAGE DECLINE. WHEN WE COMPARE

02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:11.781
THAT TO OUR PROJECTED ENROLLMENT

02:43:11.848 --> 02:43:14.951
HOWEVER DURING THE PANDEMIC- WE

02:43:15.018 --> 02:43:16.586
HAVE YOU KNOW THIS PANDEMIC

02:43:16.653 --> 02:43:18.989
CHATS LED THIS A PRECIPITOUS

02:43:19.055 --> 02:43:20.991
DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT DURING

02:43:21.057 --> 02:43:22.893
THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:27.097
YEAR- WE SAW ALMOST 3% TWO POINT

02:43:27.164 --> 02:43:29.900
9% DECLINE. IN ENROLLMENT AND

02:43:29.966 --> 02:43:32.736
AGAIN BAD MIRRORS WHY MR BRAWL

02:43:32.802 --> 02:43:36.473
MENTIONED THIS TRANSLATED INTO A

02:43:36.540 --> 02:43:41.278
LOSS OF ALMOST. THREE THOUSAND.

02:43:41.344 --> 02:43:42.179
ARE LESS THAN PROJECTED. THIS IS

02:43:42.245 --> 02:43:46.349
START THIS IS A STARK CONTRAST-

02:43:46.416 --> 02:43:49.786
TO OUR- YOU KNOW HALF A PERCENT

02:43:49.853 --> 02:43:53.456
DECLINE IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS. I

02:43:53.523 --> 02:43:55.525
AM NOT YOU KNOW AS WE SAW

02:43:55.592 --> 02:43:58.828
DECLINES ACROSS THE GRADES BANDS

02:43:58.895 --> 02:44:01.364
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT WE

02:44:01.431 --> 02:44:03.733
DID SEE A GREATER WINDS IN OUR

02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:05.602
LOWER GRADE THAT WAS MENTIONED

02:44:05.669 --> 02:44:07.837
AS WELL AS EARLY TESTIMONY. OR

02:44:07.904 --> 02:44:09.105
THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL

02:44:09.172 --> 02:44:11.808
YEAR- WE ANTICIPATE ABOUT ONE

02:44:11.875 --> 02:44:15.011
POINT SEVEN PERCENT. DECLINE IN

02:44:15.078 --> 02:44:17.547
ENROLLMENT- WHICH WHILE THIS

02:44:17.614 --> 02:44:21.484
IMPROVES OUR- ARE MOVED FROM TWO

02:44:21.551 --> 02:44:23.753
POINT NINE ALMOST THREE PERCENT.

02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:25.155
IT IS LIKE NEVER GET AWAY HIGHER

02:44:25.222 --> 02:44:26.590
THAN OUR HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF

02:44:26.656 --> 02:44:33.797
THE. IN SUMMARY OF WHAT WE THINK

02:44:33.863 --> 02:44:36.166
ABOUT THAT THE PANDEMIC. I HAS

02:44:36.233 --> 02:44:38.435
RESET OUR ROMANCE- DECLINE

02:44:38.501 --> 02:44:41.171
SUBJECT THREE- I THINK IT'S

02:44:41.238 --> 02:44:43.306
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS IS WHY

02:44:43.373 --> 02:44:45.742
THAT THE- HELP ARE LESS. I

02:44:45.809 --> 02:44:47.711
DURING A PANDEMIC PROVIDED US

02:44:47.777 --> 02:44:50.513
WITH US IT'S VERY UP FISCAL.

02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:52.482
STABILITY TO CONTINUE SERVING

02:44:52.549 --> 02:44:55.385
OUR STUDENTS- AND EXPANDING THE

02:44:55.452 --> 02:44:57.587
THAT THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES.

02:44:57.654 --> 02:45:00.523
FOR STUDENTS TO NOT ONLY RETURN

02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:04.661
BY TO ENGAGE AND SELLER. SO FOR

02:45:04.728 --> 02:45:06.263
THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE

02:45:06.329 --> 02:45:08.531
SCHOOL YEAR- THE PHASING OUT OF

02:45:08.598 --> 02:45:10.233
THE HOLD HARMLESS THIS COULD

02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:12.035
MEAN I'M FOR OUR DISTRICT.

02:45:12.102 --> 02:45:14.137
ALMOST FIFTY SEVEN MILLION

02:45:14.204 --> 02:45:17.540
DOLLARS- IN OUR BUDGET- AND

02:45:17.607 --> 02:45:19.909
WHILE THIS IS CERTAINLY IT MAY

02:45:19.976 --> 02:45:23.513
SEEM AN SIX AND BONTA CONSOLE-

02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:24.681
IN TERMS OF THE CONTEXT OF

02:45:24.748 --> 02:45:26.916
DISTRICTS BUDGET- THIS REALLY

02:45:26.983 --> 02:45:29.686
HAS AN IMPACT ON STAFF. IT'S

02:45:29.753 --> 02:45:31.821
WERE BENEFITTED FROM THESE A ONE

02:45:31.888 --> 02:45:35.025
TIME OUT. I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT

02:45:35.091 --> 02:45:37.127
SENDING A UNIFIED HAS CHOSEN TO

02:45:37.193 --> 02:45:39.963
IMPLEMENT MEDICATIONS- THAT W

02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:42.766
KNOW HAVE HELPED TO ENSURE OUR

02:45:42.832 --> 02:45:44.901
STUDENTS REMAIN HEALTHY. AND

02:45:44.968 --> 02:45:47.604
SAFE AND DURING THIS PANDEMIC

02:45:47.671 --> 02:45:49.773
AND NOW THESE ACTIONS ARE

02:45:49.839 --> 02:45:50.640
CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

02:45:50.707 --> 02:45:52.542
APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT OUR

02:45:52.609 --> 02:45:55.412
STUDENTS REMAIN IN SCHOOL- WHICH

02:45:55.478 --> 02:45:56.813
IS WHY ARE WE ARE REQUIRING

02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:58.882
UNIVERSAL MASKING INDOORS AND

02:45:58.948 --> 02:46:02.285
OUTDOORS. I AS WELL AS- BAXEEN

02:46:02.352 --> 02:46:04.487
REQUIREMENT. THAT WILL BE COMING

02:46:04.554 --> 02:46:10.360
UP BY. STARTING OUR OUR SECOND

02:46:10.427 --> 02:46:10.960
SEMESTER. FOR ALL OF OURS AND

02:46:11.027 --> 02:46:11.961
STAFF ARE WE ABLE THAT THE ACTS

02:46:12.028 --> 02:46:13.963
ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS

02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:17.367
SAFE- AND YOU KNOW REALLY GIVE

02:46:17.434 --> 02:46:20.570
FAMILY'S COMFORT. AS THEY LOOK

02:46:20.637 --> 02:46:22.605
TO RETURN TO OUR SCHOOLS. OUR

02:46:22.672 --> 02:46:25.008
NEXT I WANT TO FOCUS ON OUR- A

02:46:25.075 --> 02:46:27.911
DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS- IN THIS

02:46:27.977 --> 02:46:29.646
PANDEMIC AT CERTAINLY IMPACTED

02:46:29.713 --> 02:46:31.948
US I IN TERMS OF OUR

02:46:32.015 --> 02:46:34.184
UNDUPLICATED NUMBERS- AND THIS

02:46:34.250 --> 02:46:36.586
REALLY CAPTURES. OUR STUDENTS

02:46:36.653 --> 02:46:40.323
WHO ARE LOW INCOME ARE ENGLISH

02:46:40.390 --> 02:46:41.558
LEARNERS ARE FOSTER YOU. AND

02:46:41.624 --> 02:46:43.693
UNDER THE L. C. ABOUT A SCHOOL

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:44.494
DISTRICTS MAY RECEIVE

02:46:44.561 --> 02:46:46.563
SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION

02:46:46.629 --> 02:46:48.431
GRANTS- WHEN THEY'RE- I'M

02:46:48.498 --> 02:46:51.868
DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS. ARE AT LEAST

02:46:51.935 --> 02:46:54.237
FIFTY FIVE PERCENT- LICORNE

02:46:54.304 --> 02:46:55.972
ROMAN UNFORTUNATELY ARE

02:46:56.039 --> 02:46:57.674
UNDUPLICATED COUNT IS AT

02:46:57.741 --> 02:47:01.311
STEADILY DECLINING. I DURING THE

02:47:01.378 --> 02:47:01.911
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR

02:47:01.978 --> 02:47:04.147
ARE UNDUPLICATED ACCOUNT STOOD

02:47:04.214 --> 02:47:07.751
AT FIFTY NINE PERCENT- FOR THE

02:47:07.817 --> 02:47:08.318
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL

02:47:08.385 --> 02:47:10.653
YEAR WE ANTICIPATE- IT'S GONNA

02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:12.756
BE AROUND FIFTY FIVE POINT SIX

02:47:12.822 --> 02:47:15.759
PERCENT- THIS IS. WHAT THIS WILL

02:47:15.825 --> 02:47:18.661
MEAN FOR US IS LESS FUNDING. I

02:47:18.728 --> 02:47:21.664
TO SUPPORT OUR OUR GREATEST.

02:47:21.731 --> 02:47:23.900
NEED STUDENTS. AND DURING THE

02:47:23.967 --> 02:47:26.136
PANDEMIC- WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT

02:47:26.202 --> 02:47:28.304
ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WORK BAD.

02:47:28.371 --> 02:47:32.542
AND UNIVERSAL A MEAL- PLANS-

02:47:32.609 --> 02:47:34.878
WERE IN. PLACE OUR GROCERIES

02:47:34.944 --> 02:47:37.313
MORE AVAILABLE AND- THIS IS WHY

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:41.451
WE DID APPRECIATE THE UNIVERSAL-

02:47:41.518 --> 02:47:43.820
MEALS SCHOOL MALES- BECAUSE WE

02:47:43.887 --> 02:47:45.755
KNOW THAT OUR OUR COMMUNITY IS

02:47:45.822 --> 02:47:48.992
NEEDED S. AND WHILE THIS

02:47:49.058 --> 02:47:51.561
UNIVERSAL ASPECT- OF SCHOOL

02:47:51.628 --> 02:47:54.164
MEALS. MEANS THERE'S- NO LONGER

02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:55.532
AN INCENTIVE FOR FAMILIES TO

02:47:55.598 --> 02:47:57.534
SUBMIT THE FORMS NEEDED FOR US

02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:58.768
TO TRACK OUR AND DO DUPLICATE

02:47:58.835 --> 02:48:00.637
ACCOUNTS. WHICH IS CRITICAL TO

02:48:00.703 --> 02:48:02.839
OUR LCS ARE FINDING IT SO- I

02:48:02.906 --> 02:48:04.340
WANT TO ENCOURAGE US TO THINK

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:06.943
ABOUT THIS- AND SO THIS IS

02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:07.677
CERTAINLY A TRADE OFF THAT WE

02:48:07.744 --> 02:48:12.015
FACE- AND- IT'S CERTAINLY.

02:48:12.081 --> 02:48:14.284
SHOULD BE COMMENDED- THAT WE

02:48:14.350 --> 02:48:17.153
HAVE THIS POLICY- WE CERTAINLY

02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:18.588
WANT TO URGE THE STATE TO

02:48:18.655 --> 02:48:20.290
CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO

02:48:20.356 --> 02:48:22.492
IDENTIFY- FOR LOW INCOME

02:48:22.559 --> 02:48:25.595
STUDENTS- AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING

02:48:25.662 --> 02:48:27.831
TO THINK OF WAYS TO DO THIS SITE

02:48:27.897 --> 02:48:33.403
WE DON'T HAVE. ANY CONCRETE

02:48:33.470 --> 02:48:34.871
ACTIONS AT THIS TIME- IN OF OUR

02:48:34.938 --> 02:48:36.406
- STUDENTS OR X. OUR COMMUNITY

02:48:36.473 --> 02:48:37.841
IN THIS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER AS

02:48:37.907 --> 02:48:41.010
WELL- THE DYNAMIC BUT I JUST

02:48:41.077 --> 02:48:46.683
MENTIONED- ARE THE CATALYST AND

02:48:46.749 --> 02:48:48.184
TO WATCH AND IT WHERE ARE OUR

02:48:48.251 --> 02:48:50.954
ART STUDENTS GOING- THIS IS VERY

02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:53.823
COMPLEX I THINK- AS AS BEEN MADE

02:48:53.890 --> 02:48:56.526
IN EARLIER TESTIMONY. IN THE

02:48:56.593 --> 02:48:58.027
CITY OF SAN DIEGO WE CAN POINT

02:48:58.094 --> 02:49:00.096
TO THE HOME VALUES AND THE COST

02:49:00.163 --> 02:49:02.966
OF LIVING INCREASES- AND THESE

02:49:03.032 --> 02:49:04.701
INCREASES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL

02:49:04.767 --> 02:49:06.369
OUT WHICH MEANS THAT THERE ARE

02:49:06.436 --> 02:49:07.470
LESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW

02:49:07.537 --> 02:49:08.571
INCOME FAMILIES AND YOUNG

02:49:08.638 --> 02:49:11.040
PROFESSIONALS- TO LIVE IN THE

02:49:11.107 --> 02:49:14.644
CITY- BUT BEYOND THIS- I WOULD

02:49:14.711 --> 02:49:16.279
SUGGEST THAT SOME OF OUR-

02:49:16.346 --> 02:49:18.181
ANECDOTES AND PRELIMINARY

02:49:18.248 --> 02:49:21.284
ANALYSIS- THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES

02:49:21.351 --> 02:49:23.119
IN TERMS OF WHAT IS CONTRIBUTING

02:49:23.186 --> 02:49:25.221
TO OUR DECLINING ENROLLMENT- THE

02:49:25.288 --> 02:49:26.756
FIRST IS THE TRANSFERRED TO

02:49:26.823 --> 02:49:30.860
PRIVATE SCHOOLS- I THINK THIS IS

02:49:30.927 --> 02:49:31.928
A- YEAH. THAT WE FACE-

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:35.164
PARTICULARLY- WHEN WE LOOK AT-

02:49:35.231 --> 02:49:36.065
THE MANDATES THAT WE HAVE IN

02:49:36.132 --> 02:49:39.068
PLACE. AGAINST BALI- TRANSFERS

02:49:39.135 --> 02:49:41.838
TO OUR- OTHER PRODUCTS ARE

02:49:41.905 --> 02:49:43.640
BETTER AND THEY THE SURROUNDING

02:49:43.706 --> 02:49:46.242
COUNTY. AND ALSO STUDENTS WHO

02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:47.143
ARE TRANSFERRING OUT OF THE

02:49:47.210 --> 02:49:53.416
STATE- ANY OF THESE- YVERDON AT

02:49:53.483 --> 02:49:54.884
EACH OF THE DEPARTMENT MOMENT

02:49:54.951 --> 02:49:57.353
YEAR OVER YEAR- THIS MEANS LESS

02:49:57.420 --> 02:50:01.124
FUNDING- AND AGAIN. IT'S GOING

02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:04.394
TO UP. FACE CHALLENGES ON US AS

02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:05.495
WE LOOK TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL

02:50:05.562 --> 02:50:08.765
PARTS OF THE- I'M FINALLY I WANT

02:50:08.831 --> 02:50:10.800
TO. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR

02:50:10.867 --> 02:50:12.502
ROUTE RECOVERY PLAN AND- AT SOME

02:50:12.569 --> 02:50:13.603
OF THESE COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN

02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:15.572
MENTIONED EARLIER BUT- UP WE

02:50:15.638 --> 02:50:16.773
HAVE PRIORITIZE LEARNING

02:50:16.839 --> 02:50:20.176
ENRICHMENT- AND OUR INVESTMENT

02:50:20.243 --> 02:50:22.011
IN EARLY EDUCATION AND MENTAL

02:50:22.078 --> 02:50:25.281
HEALTH. ARE THE PAST THIS PAST

02:50:25.348 --> 02:50:28.284
SUMMER- WE HAVE PROVIDED OUR

02:50:28.351 --> 02:50:30.720
STUDENTS WITH THE DOORS LOCKED

02:50:30.787 --> 02:50:33.523
I'M- AND WEBER ERRING ADULTS-

02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:36.426
ARE. INTO A PROCESS THAT WE ALL

A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. TO

LOOK AT- LEARNING SUMMER

02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:45.802
LEARNING AND ADDRESSING THE

02:50:45.868 --> 02:50:46.703
LEARNING LOSS THAT MANY PEOPLE

02:50:46.769 --> 02:50:48.137
TALK ABOUT AND THEN THE

02:50:48.204 --> 02:50:50.173
ENRICHMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:50:50.239 --> 02:50:52.508
PREPARE STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY.

02:50:52.575 --> 02:50:54.911
AND SOCIALLY EMOTIONALLY I TO BE

02:50:54.978 --> 02:50:58.281
WITH YEARS- INCITING- OUTSIDE

02:50:58.348 --> 02:51:00.750

THE COVER. ARE YOU TALKED ABOUT

02:56:00.216 --> 02:56:01.317
THE CLIP TO MAKE TURNING THE

02:56:01.384 --> 02:56:04.387
CLIFF INTO A SLOPE. AS FAR AS-

02:56:04.453 --> 02:56:07.089
THE FISCAL CLIFF WITH REGARD TO-

02:56:07.156 --> 02:56:09.525
DECLINING ENROLLMENT- WHAT ARE

02:56:09.592 --> 02:56:10.660
THE ALTERNATIVES FROM YOUR

02:56:10.726 --> 02:56:13.462
PERSPECTIVE. TO MAKE IT- TO

02:56:13.529 --> 02:56:15.965
CREATE A SLOPE INSTEAD OF A

02:56:16.032 --> 02:56:17.833
CLIFF. I IMAGINE. BUILDING UP

02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:19.201
THE BASE WOULD BE ONE OF THEM

02:56:19.268 --> 02:56:20.569
MAYBE YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT

02:56:20.636 --> 02:56:21.003
OR MAYBE SOME OTHER

02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:24.941
ALTERNATIVES. TO CREATING THAT

02:56:25.007 --> 02:56:25.875
SLOPE THAT YOU DISCUSSED. SURE

02:56:25.942 --> 02:56:28.511
WELL I. SO THERE ARE SPECIFIC TO

02:56:28.577 --> 02:56:30.413
THE TOPIC OF DECLINING

02:56:30.479 --> 02:56:33.316
ENROLLMENT- WELL ONE OF THE

02:56:33.382 --> 02:56:35.851
IDEAS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN

02:56:35.918 --> 02:56:38.487
DISCUSSION WITH WITH- VERY

02:56:38.554 --> 02:56:41.891
STAFF- WOULD BE THE USE OF A-

02:56:41.958 --> 02:56:43.893
THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE. OR

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:46.996
EIGHTY EIGHT. ARE FOR TEMPORARY

02:56:47.063 --> 02:56:49.131
PERIOD OF TIME SIX FIVE YEARS-

02:56:49.198 --> 02:56:50.666
SHOULD THE FORMULA WOULD LOOK

02:56:50.733 --> 02:56:52.768
MORE LONG- THE HIGHER AT THE

02:56:52.835 --> 02:56:54.637
CURRENT YEAR. SO THAT WE CAN

02:56:54.704 --> 02:56:56.539
HELP I CANNOT FOR GROWTH

02:56:56.605 --> 02:56:59.642
DISTRICTS. FOR THE PRIOR THREE

02:56:59.709 --> 02:57:03.446
YEARS. ROLLING AVERAGE ABA. FOR

02:57:03.512 --> 02:57:07.049
NEXT YEAR TWO TO THREE ABOUT-

02:57:07.116 --> 02:57:10.453
CHANGE THE CLIFF TO. GRADUAL

02:57:10.519 --> 02:57:12.154
SLOPE ARE BECAUSE THE PRIOR

02:57:12.221 --> 02:57:16.559
THREE YEARS WOULD BE. NINETEEN

02:57:16.625 --> 02:57:17.126
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AS A

02:57:17.193 --> 02:57:19.695
PROXY FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

02:57:19.762 --> 02:57:21.030
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO S. AS MR

02:57:21.097 --> 02:57:23.265
BALL OUTLINED EARLIER IN THE

02:57:23.332 --> 02:57:25.568
COULD NOT PROCESS. THE REASON

02:57:25.634 --> 02:57:27.003
FOR THE THREE YEAR AVERAGE IS WE

02:57:27.069 --> 02:57:29.772
CURRENTLY USE THAT METHODOLOGY

02:57:29.839 --> 02:57:32.375
ARCTIC TO COMPUTE THE ARTICLE

02:57:32.441 --> 02:57:34.710
TODAY PEOPLE PERCENT EACH VISIT

02:57:34.777 --> 02:57:36.345
FOR YOU AVERAGE IN PART TO

02:57:36.412 --> 02:57:38.547
STABILIZE THE YEAR TO YEAR

02:57:38.614 --> 02:57:41.083
CHANGES IN THE NUMBER. IT'S ALSO

02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:43.719
CURRENTLY THE PROCESS BEING USED

02:57:43.786 --> 02:57:44.754
TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL I

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:46.255
THINK THERE ARE MERGING SEA

02:57:46.322 --> 02:57:49.558
FUNDING ALLOCATION. I DON'T

02:57:49.625 --> 02:57:50.359
RECALL THE EXACT TITLE OF THE

02:57:50.426 --> 02:57:57.366
FORMULA BUT. IT IS ALSO. USING A

02:57:57.433 --> 02:57:59.535
YEAR AVERAGE. IS BEING ABLE TO

02:57:59.602 --> 02:58:02.405
AT ON. IN OUR- GOING TO CALL TO

02:58:02.471 --> 02:58:04.407
STAY. THEIR FUNDING THIS PERIOD

02:58:04.473 --> 02:58:07.743
TIME AS WELL. ALL IT DOES ACOSTA

02:58:07.810 --> 02:58:10.312
OKAY BUT AGAIN I'M TEST ONE OF

02:58:10.379 --> 02:58:11.914
PROP NINETY EIGHT WE BELIEVE

02:58:11.981 --> 02:58:14.583
THAT THAT IS LIKELY AFFORDABLE

02:58:14.650 --> 02:58:15.518
THE REASON FOR THE TEMPORARY

02:58:15.584 --> 02:58:16.685
COULD ALSO BE PART MORE

02:58:16.752 --> 02:58:18.487
PERMANENT BUT THE REASON FOR THE

02:58:18.554 --> 02:58:21.290
TEMPORARY WE WOULD SUGGEST MAYBE

02:58:21.357 --> 02:58:22.658
FIVE YEARS AFTER TWENTY SIX

02:58:22.725 --> 02:58:23.926
TWENTY SEVEN. ARE THE REASON FOR

02:58:23.993 --> 02:58:28.297
THAT IS IT WOULD BUT IF WE LOOK

02:58:28.364 --> 02:58:28.898
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

02:58:28.964 --> 02:58:31.600
YOUR FORECAST. AND IF WE AGREE

02:58:31.667 --> 02:58:33.335
THAT THE PANDEMIC IS XCELERATED

02:58:33.402 --> 02:58:36.705
GOT FORECAST- DAN. PROBABLY

02:58:36.772 --> 02:58:39.175
ACCELERATED BY WITH ROUGHLY HALF

02:58:39.241 --> 02:58:40.242
WHICH MEANS THAT OVER A FIVE

02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:42.278
YEAR PERIOD. WE WOULD SHIP HELLO

02:58:42.344 --> 02:58:45.881
MARK- NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO

02:58:45.948 --> 02:58:47.683
DURING THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME.

02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:49.518
IS THE IMPLEMENTATION. OR

02:58:49.585 --> 02:58:50.820
TRANSITIONAL CAN UNIVERSAL

02:58:50.886 --> 02:58:52.521
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN ALWAYS

02:58:52.588 --> 02:58:55.324
BEGIN TO SEE THE BENEFITS- ON

02:58:55.391 --> 02:58:57.393
THE FINANCIAL SIDE IF YOU WILL

02:58:57.460 --> 02:58:59.028
OF THAT INTERPRETATION. SO THAT

02:58:59.095 --> 02:59:01.297
WOULD BE ONE IDEA WITHOUT

02:59:01.363 --> 02:59:04.900
CHANGING THE ALSO YEAH- WE ALSO

02:59:04.967 --> 02:59:09.105
HAVE. TO YOU KNOW HAS. VERY

02:59:09.171 --> 02:59:11.674
SWEET CAN TO IT BUT- BUT SUCH

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:16.512
NEED COMPILE IS AVERAGE DAILY

02:59:16.579 --> 02:59:18.581
TO- ADVERSELY TO THAT- THE IDEA

02:59:18.647 --> 02:59:22.685
OF- NEED TO ROLL IT BASED ON WHO

02:59:22.751 --> 02:59:24.787
WITH ALL THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS-

02:59:24.854 --> 02:59:25.855
WHILE THAT'S WORTHY OF

02:59:25.921 --> 02:59:29.391
CONSIDERATION- THAT LONGER TERM.

02:59:29.458 --> 02:59:30.826

SUPERINTENDENT JACKSON WITH THE

03:04:56.318 --> 03:04:58.153
SAN DIEGO UNIFIED ARE YOU

03:04:58.220 --> 03:05:00.222
MENTIONED A FEW TIMES THAT YOU

03:05:00.289 --> 03:05:00.823
ONE OF THE CAUSES OF REDUCED

03:05:00.889 --> 03:05:04.293
ENROLLMENT IS- IS PARENTS WHO-

03:05:04.359 --> 03:05:06.028
HAVE AN ISSUE WITH SOME OF THE

03:05:06.094 --> 03:05:06.962
POLICIES THAT THE DISTRICT HAS

03:05:07.029 --> 03:05:08.730
ADOPTED. I THINK YOU MENTIONED

03:05:08.797 --> 03:05:09.798
ONE OF THE THAT STUDENTS ARE

03:05:09.865 --> 03:05:11.200
TRANSFERRING TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS

03:05:11.266 --> 03:05:13.469
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE MANDATES

03:05:13.535 --> 03:05:14.102
YOU HAVE WHAT MANDATES ARE YOUR

03:05:14.169 --> 03:05:17.806
FRIEND TO. SO WE LOOK AT OUR-

03:05:17.873 --> 03:05:19.341
ARE MEDICATIONS THAT WE PUT IN

03:05:19.408 --> 03:05:22.344
PLACE WHETHER IT BE- TESTING-

03:05:22.411 --> 03:05:24.179
WHETHER BE THE MASS MANDATE

03:05:24.246 --> 03:05:26.381
WHETHER BE- PUSHING AND

03:05:26.448 --> 03:05:29.485
ENCOURAGING. OF FOR VACCINE-

03:05:29.551 --> 03:05:31.186
WHAT WE NOTICE IS THAT A LARGE

03:05:31.253 --> 03:05:33.055
MAJORITY OF OUR FAMILIES. ARE

03:05:33.121 --> 03:05:35.224
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING

03:05:35.290 --> 03:05:38.260
SICK ON OUR CAMPUSES- AND TAKING

03:05:38.327 --> 03:05:41.530
THAT HOME. I TO- FAMILY MEMBERS

03:05:41.597 --> 03:05:44.233
OR L. AND SO. SOME SOME DISAGREE

03:05:44.299 --> 03:05:46.502
WITH- YOU KNOW THE MASKING THAT

03:05:46.568 --> 03:05:50.506
WE HAVE IN TERMS OF. OUTDOOR

03:05:50.572 --> 03:05:52.374
MASCOT AND SO. THOSE COULD BE

03:05:52.441 --> 03:05:55.444
SOME REASONS WHY CHOOSING TO

03:05:55.511 --> 03:05:57.913
LEAVE. THANK YOU AND SINCE YOU

03:05:57.980 --> 03:05:59.548
BROUGHT UP IN WITH THE OUTCOME

03:05:59.615 --> 03:06:00.382
ASKING THAT ISN'T REQUIRED BY

03:06:00.449 --> 03:06:02.518
THE STATE AND ALL THE STUDIES

03:06:02.584 --> 03:06:03.552
I'VE SEEN SHOWN IT DOESN'T

03:06:03.619 --> 03:06:05.187
REALLY HELP WITH STOPPING

03:06:05.254 --> 03:06:07.189
TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS. BUT

03:06:07.256 --> 03:06:08.590
YET YOU'RE SAYING IT'S CAUSING.

03:06:08.924 --> 03:06:11.226
OFFICE FOR THE DISTRICT IS

03:06:11.293 --> 03:06:13.829
YOU HAVE THE POLICY. I THINK

03:06:13.896 --> 03:06:17.232
IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOK AT-

03:06:17.299 --> 03:06:18.567
YOU KNOW CODE IN KEEPING OUR

03:06:18.634 --> 03:06:20.435
COMMUNITY SAFE ONE OF THE THINGS

03:06:20.502 --> 03:06:21.803
WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR NUMBERS

03:06:21.870 --> 03:06:23.639
COMPARED TO MANY OF THE DESERT

03:06:23.705 --> 03:06:25.741
STORM WE PAID ATTENTION. UP WE

03:06:25.807 --> 03:06:29.111
HAD YOUR- RATES OF INFECTION IN

03:06:29.177 --> 03:06:34.216
CASES- AND- THE SPREAD SO I

03:06:34.283 --> 03:06:35.884
THINK- THE MEDICATIONS THAT WE

03:06:35.951 --> 03:06:38.353
HAD IN PLACE- WE'RE DEFINITELY

03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:40.188
KEEPING OUR OUR KIDS SAFE AND I

03:06:40.255 --> 03:06:41.757
WOULD SAY. I MANY OF OUR

03:06:41.823 --> 03:06:43.425
FAMILIES MOST OF OUR FAMILIES

03:06:43.492 --> 03:06:44.760
WERE REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THAT

03:06:44.826 --> 03:06:47.629
I THINK IT TO YOUR POINT- SOME

03:06:47.696 --> 03:06:48.297
FOLKS TO SEND WHILE YOU'RE GOING

03:06:48.363 --> 03:06:51.400
BEYOND THAT- AND SO I DON'T I

03:06:51.466 --> 03:06:52.801
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE HARD DATA

03:06:52.868 --> 03:06:53.769
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY

03:06:53.835 --> 03:06:55.871
SURVEYS AND SAY THAT. I'M I'M

03:06:55.938 --> 03:06:58.874
JUST MAKING. A NOTE THAT SOME

03:06:58.941 --> 03:06:59.908
PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY IN THAT

03:06:59.975 --> 03:07:02.444
COULD BE A CAUSE FOR PEOPLE TO

03:07:02.511 --> 03:07:04.313
MAKE A DECISION SHOULD CHECK OUT

03:07:04.379 --> 03:07:05.881
IT. I SEE AND I CERTAINLY

03:07:05.948 --> 03:07:07.215
APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK OF YOU

03:07:07.282 --> 03:07:08.383

03:07:08.450 --> 03:07:09.851
AND- I'M ALWAYS LOOKING TO LEARN

03:07:09.918 --> 03:07:11.053
MORE THOSE DID YOU HAVE ANY

03:07:11.119 --> 03:07:12.321
INORMATION SHOWING THAT THE-

03:07:12.387 --> 03:07:13.455
OUTDOOR MASK POLICY IN

03:07:13.522 --> 03:07:15.157
PARTICULAR HAS LED TO LOWER-

03:07:15.223 --> 03:07:18.093
TRANSMISSION- I WOULD SAY.

03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:20.696
SUGGEST THAT IT'S NOT ONE- A

03:07:20.762 --> 03:07:22.397
MITIGATION STRATEGY BUT A

03:07:22.464 --> 03:07:23.665
COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION

03:07:23.732 --> 03:07:25.701
STRATEGIES. SO I DON'TKNOW THAT

03:07:25.767 --> 03:07:27.703
WE COULD WE COULD PULL OUT ONE

03:07:27.769 --> 03:07:30.572
COMPONENT- AND SUGGESTS THAT. I

03:07:30.639 --> 03:07:31.974
WILL MAKE NOTE THAT ONE OF THE

03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:33.475
THINGS THAT WE ARE PAYING CLOSE

03:07:33.542 --> 03:07:35.777
ATTENTION TO IS. ONE WE DO HAVE

03:07:35.844 --> 03:07:38.647
THE REDUCTION OF OUR OUR CASES.

03:07:38.714 --> 03:07:41.083
HOW DO WE- BACK SOME OF THE

03:07:41.149 --> 03:07:44.786
MEDICATION. AND MAYBE NOT HAVE.

03:07:44.853 --> 03:07:46.321
THE OUTDOOR MASKING SO THAT'S

03:07:46.388 --> 03:07:48.890
SOMETHING WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION

03:07:48.957 --> 03:07:52.594
TO OR- WE'VE HAD- MASKING FOR

03:07:52.661 --> 03:07:54.630
OUR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS AND-

03:07:54.696 --> 03:07:56.331

03:08:02.904 --> 03:08:05.440
LOOKING AT THESE- MITIGATION

03:08:05.507 --> 03:08:09.211
STRATEGIES TO SEE WHERE WE CAN-

03:08:09.277 --> 03:08:10.912
BACK FOR EXAMPLE THE COLT FORTY.

03:08:10.979 --> 03:08:13.815
I HAD OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS-

03:08:13.882 --> 03:08:15.817

FOR CONTACT TRACING HAS BEEN

03:08:17.019 --> 03:08:18.887
VERY BENEFICIAL. AND I WOULD SAY

03:08:18.954 --> 03:08:21.256
IF WE LOOK AT OUR RATES- THERE

03:08:21.323 --> 03:08:23.425
IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AND WERE.

03:08:23.492 --> 03:08:24.726
YOU KNOW AS I SAID THE SECOND

03:08:24.793 --> 03:08:26.962
LARGEST IN IN THE STATE. OF THE

03:08:27.029 --> 03:08:29.431
LARGEST IN THE COUNTY- AND WHEN

03:08:29.498 --> 03:08:30.899
YOU LOOK AT OUR RATES. I WOULD

03:08:30.966 --> 03:08:33.535
SAY COMPARATIVELY- THEY HAVE

03:08:33.602 --> 03:08:36.304
BEEN REDUCED- BUT I. AGAIN GOING

03:08:36.371 --> 03:08:38.106
BACK TO YOUR MAJOR POINT OF. I

03:08:38.173 --> 03:08:40.042
DON'T KNOW THAT WE GET ALL OUT

03:08:40.108 --> 03:08:41.376
ONE PARTICULAR MEDICATION I

03:08:41.443 --> 03:08:42.077
THINK IT'S MORE OF A

03:08:42.144 --> 03:08:46.248
COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE. OF

FOR EACH DOLLAR REVENUE LOST- IN

03:09:21.650 --> 03:09:24.186
THAT KIND OF LIKELY MORE-

03:09:24.252 --> 03:09:25.954
REALISTIC PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU

03:09:26.021 --> 03:09:27.789

FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR OR MORE

03:10:14.803 --> 03:10:15.804
BUDGET DEFICIT THAT THEY'RE

03:10:15.871 --> 03:10:20.375

COALBED- IT GIVEN THE DECLINING

03:10:29.217 --> 03:10:30.252
ENROLLMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE

DARLING HAMMOND LAID OUT WHICH

03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:40.729
WHAT WE REALLY FOCUS ON MUCH

03:10:40.796 --> 03:10:42.898
MORE INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS.

03:10:42.964 --> 03:10:47.335
FOR STUDENTS. NUMBER BONTA

03:10:47.402 --> 03:10:49.004

QUARANTINE OR WE'RE TALKING

03:10:52.407 --> 03:10:54.943
ABOUT- SUCH A REDUCTION IN

03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:57.212
STUDENTS AND LOCAL SCRIPTED BABY

03:10:57.279 --> 03:10:58.847
NO LONGER GOING TO OPERATE THAT

03:11:02.784 --> 03:11:04.886
IMMEDIATE MOMENT LOOKING AT

03:11:04.953 --> 03:11:08.456
SCHOOL CLOSURE AS ONE AWAY TO BE

03:11:08.523 --> 03:11:12.093
ABLE TO MITIGATE THAT LIKELY AT

03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:17.265
DECLINE THE IMPACT. OF THE

03:11:17.332 --> 03:11:18.266
DECLINING ENROLLMENT OVER TIME.

03:11:18.333 --> 03:11:20.235
THANK YOU- ALL SO FIRST OFF I

03:11:20.302 --> 03:11:21.736
THINK ALREADY THAT ANY SCHOOL

03:11:21.803 --> 03:11:23.138
CLOSURE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

03:11:23.205 --> 03:11:24.306
DIFFICULT DECISION BUT A

03:11:24.372 --> 03:11:25.807
GOVERNING BOARD HAS TO MAKE THE

03:11:25.874 --> 03:11:28.043
LOCAL DISTRICT- OUR SCHOOLS ARE

03:11:28.109 --> 03:11:29.644
CENTRAL TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS

03:11:29.711 --> 03:11:32.380
IN OUR COMMUNITIES- AND THAT'S

03:11:32.447 --> 03:11:34.149
JUST A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION

03:11:34.216 --> 03:11:36.117
RIGHT WE DON'T. WE DON'T LIKE TO

03:11:36.184 --> 03:11:38.119
MESS WITH BUS SCHEDULES AND BUS

03:11:38.186 --> 03:11:39.421
ROUTES AND WE DON'T LIKE TO MESS

03:11:39.487 --> 03:11:42.123
WITH HER SCHOOL BOUNDARIES AND

03:11:42.190 --> 03:11:43.024
THINGS LIKE THAT THOSE ARE ALL

03:11:43.091 --> 03:11:47.095
VERY DIFFICULT HIGHLY CHARGED

03:11:47.162 --> 03:11:51.032
ISSUES- LET ME SAY THIS I. IT I

03:11:51.099 --> 03:11:54.569
DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE DECLINE

03:11:54.636 --> 03:11:56.371
THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW.

03:11:56.438 --> 03:11:59.207
BILLS IN AND OF ITSELF THE

03:11:59.274 --> 03:12:01.209
REASON TO GO CLOSEST SCHOOL ARE

03:12:01.276 --> 03:12:03.645
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD AND SHE CAN BE

03:12:03.712 --> 03:12:04.546
KIDS AROUND AND REDISTRIBUTE

03:12:04.613 --> 03:12:08.917
BACK. IT MAY BE THAT THIS

03:12:08.984 --> 03:12:11.620
DECLINE IS THE LAST. YOU'RE A

03:12:11.686 --> 03:12:13.421
TEN YEARS OF DECLINE- AND THAT

03:12:13.488 --> 03:12:14.856
WOULD BE THE CASE IN A NUMBER OF

03:12:14.923 --> 03:12:16.858
DISTRICTS AND THEREFORE IT MAKES

03:12:16.925 --> 03:12:18.827
FINALLY THE ISLAND IT'S PROBABLY

03:12:18.894 --> 03:12:20.262
THE PERIOD OF TIME WHICH PUSHES

03:12:20.328 --> 03:12:25.467
ON TO THAT CONSIDERATION- I.

03:12:25.533 --> 03:12:27.535
THERE'S AN IDEAL PROCESS WITH

03:12:27.602 --> 03:12:29.971
REGARD TO CLOSING SCHOOLS IF YOU

03:12:30.038 --> 03:12:32.641
GOT THAT NUMBER ONE- I THINK YOU

03:12:32.707 --> 03:12:34.643
JUST LOOK AT THE WHOLE DISTRICT

03:12:34.709 --> 03:12:36.778
COULD NOT. BE A NEIGHBORHOOD

03:12:36.845 --> 03:12:42.384
THAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE. ARM ALL

03:12:42.450 --> 03:12:46.488
THE- TARGETED LACK OF BETTER

03:12:46.554 --> 03:12:47.889
WORD TARGETED CLOSER TO YOU LOOK

03:12:47.956 --> 03:12:48.890
AT THE WHOLE DISTRICT YOU

03:12:48.957 --> 03:12:50.926
ANALYZE THE HOME NEEDS OF THE

03:12:50.992 --> 03:12:54.095
DISTRICT INCLUDING- THE EXPANDED

TYPES OF PROGRAMS- POTENTIAL

03:13:04.139 --> 03:13:08.777
SPACE FOR- STAFF DEVELOPMENT-

03:13:08.843 --> 03:13:09.244

COULD LOOK AT HOW WE DO EIGHTY

03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:34.682
EIGHT IN CALIFORNIA. WITH

03:16:34.749 --> 03:16:37.485
ATTENDANCE ISSUES RELATED TO-

03:16:37.552 --> 03:16:40.688
ENROLLMENT AND ACTUAL ATTENDANCE

AND YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD I

03:16:42.257 --> 03:16:43.725
KNOW YOU OF COURSE YOU MENTIONED

03:16:43.791 --> 03:16:44.893
THAT THE HOLD HARMLESS THAT

03:16:44.959 --> 03:16:47.061
WE'VE BEEN ZEROED IN ON FOCUSED

03:16:47.128 --> 03:16:48.363
ON DURING THIS PANDEMIC BUT

03:16:48.429 --> 03:16:51.599
GOING FORWARD. ANY SUGGESTIONS

03:16:51.666 --> 03:16:52.233
OR RECOMMENDATIONS YOU MAY HAVE

03:16:52.300 --> 03:16:54.869
FOR US. WE DON'T HAVE ANY

03:16:54.936 --> 03:16:56.237
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I

03:16:56.304 --> 03:16:57.272
WOULD HAVE MADE A FEW ISSUES

03:16:57.338 --> 03:16:57.872
THAT I THINK HAVE BEEN

03:16:57.939 --> 03:16:59.507
MENTIONED. I'M INCLUDING IT THE

03:16:59.574 --> 03:17:00.942
BIG ONE BY US OF A NUMBER OF

03:17:01.009 --> 03:17:02.944
MCCARTY I'M SO I DON'T WE I

03:17:03.011 --> 03:17:04.979
DON'T. I DO NOT RECALL A TIME

03:17:05.046 --> 03:17:06.881
WHEN THE STATE HOUSE- HAD IN

03:17:06.948 --> 03:17:08.716
ATTENDANCE BASED R. OR SOMETHING

03:17:08.783 --> 03:17:09.684
OUTSIDE OF AN ATTEMPTED

03:17:09.751 --> 03:17:11.286
STRUCTURE BUT ONE CHANGE THAT WE

03:17:11.352 --> 03:17:11.886
DID MAKE IN THE MID NINETIES

03:17:11.953 --> 03:17:14.622
WITH TO- WE USED TO ALLOW FOR

03:17:14.689 --> 03:17:16.758
IT. EXCUSED ABSENCES THAN

03:17:16.824 --> 03:17:18.393
DISTRICTS FOR GENERATE FUNDING

03:17:18.459 --> 03:17:19.894
FOR OUR KIDS WE MOVED AWAY FROM

03:17:19.961 --> 03:17:22.030
THAT- AND TOOK THE PARTS OF

03:17:22.096 --> 03:17:23.364
JUSTICE STUDENTS ARE NOT ACROSS

03:17:23.431 --> 03:17:24.566
FROM THERE ARE COMING I THINK.

03:17:24.632 --> 03:17:25.667
THE REASON WE HAVE OUR SYSTEM IS

03:17:25.733 --> 03:17:26.834
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS

03:17:26.901 --> 03:17:28.002
THAT WE DO NOT COLLECT PAYMENT

03:17:28.069 --> 03:17:29.904
DATA. BUT THERE IS THE THERE ARE

03:17:29.971 --> 03:17:31.940
OFTEN TIMES WHERE THERE'S LESS

03:17:32.006 --> 03:17:32.874
ATTENTION PLACED ON GETTING

03:17:32.941 --> 03:17:34.375
STUDENTS. ARE PREDICTIONS ARE

03:17:34.442 --> 03:17:36.010
OFTEN STRUGGLING AND MAYBE HAVE

03:17:36.077 --> 03:17:37.178
BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS OR OTHER

03:17:37.245 --> 03:17:39.047
CHALLENGES AND THERE'S A LOT OF

03:17:39.113 --> 03:17:40.148
COMMITMENTS CONSERVE OUR GATE

03:17:40.215 --> 03:17:41.516
KEEPING IN THE CLASSROOM SO I

03:17:41.583 --> 03:17:42.717
THINK THAT IS A- CONCERN THAT

03:17:42.784 --> 03:17:45.186
THAT THAT IT. WE HAVE WE DON'T

03:17:45.253 --> 03:17:46.221
HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON

03:17:46.287 --> 03:17:48.022
WHETHER TO MOVE TO ENROLL BASED

03:17:48.089 --> 03:17:49.691
MODEL BUT WE DO. HAVE SOME

03:17:49.757 --> 03:17:51.025
CONCERNS ABOUT A LOT MORE MOVING

03:17:51.092 --> 03:17:52.160
AWAY AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS

03:17:52.227 --> 03:17:54.028
WOULD BE. THE OTHER THING THAT I

03:17:54.095 --> 03:17:56.064
BELIEVE WAS MENTIONED- IT IN

03:17:56.130 --> 03:17:57.899
THERE IT MIGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

03:17:57.966 --> 03:18:02.704
FROM- PRESERVATIVES WORKS IF

03:18:02.770 --> 03:18:04.639
THAT. ARE WE RIGHT NOW COLLECTS

03:18:04.706 --> 03:18:06.441
CENSUS WE HAVE EIGHT ONE DAY

03:18:06.507 --> 03:18:08.176
YEAR OCTOBER CENTERS BASED MODEL

03:18:08.243 --> 03:18:09.644
AND SO WE DEFINITELY WOULD NOT

03:18:09.711 --> 03:18:10.678
RECOMMEND THAT YOU MOVED TO AN

03:18:10.745 --> 03:18:12.113
ENROLLMENT BASED MODEL THAT.

03:18:12.180 --> 03:18:13.881
ONLY LOOKS AT THE BEGINNING OF

03:18:13.948 --> 03:18:15.216
THE YEAR ENROLLMENT AND PROVIDE

03:18:15.283 --> 03:18:16.684
FUNDING BASED ON MODERATE USE

03:18:16.751 --> 03:18:17.719
THAT CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT

03:18:17.785 --> 03:18:19.320
WHERE. THERE MAY BE IS AN

03:18:19.387 --> 03:18:20.321
INTEREST IN GETTING STUDENTS AND

03:18:20.388 --> 03:18:21.055
ALL THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR

03:18:21.122 --> 03:18:23.491
AND THEN NO INCENTIVEFOR THEM

03:18:23.558 --> 03:18:24.692
TO MAINTAIN STAY IN ROLE

03:18:24.759 --> 03:18:25.793
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO YOU WOULD

03:18:25.860 --> 03:18:27.929
NEED TO MAKE CHANGES. IN HOW YOU

03:18:27.996 --> 03:18:29.097
USE THAT ENROLLMENT DATA IN

03:18:29.163 --> 03:18:31.332
ORDER TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT

03:18:31.399 --> 03:18:33.234
WOULD CONTINUE IT COULD NOT HAVE

03:18:33.301 --> 03:18:34.969
THE ARE SORT OF. A POTENTIAL

03:18:35.036 --> 03:18:36.070
THAT THERE'S CONCERN THROUGHOUT

03:18:36.137 --> 03:18:37.405
THE YEAR NOW THEN AT SOME POINT

03:18:37.472 --> 03:18:38.640
YOU HAVE TO HAVE MULTIPLE POINTS

03:18:38.706 --> 03:18:40.875
OF COLLECTION AND- THAT WILL

03:18:40.942 --> 03:18:44.612
BECOME MOREADMINISTRATIVELY.

03:18:44.679 --> 03:18:45.813
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLECTING

03:18:45.880 --> 03:18:46.781
OVER THERE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT

03:18:46.848 --> 03:18:48.416
HIGHER PERHAPS WHEN YOU HAVE

03:18:48.483 --> 03:18:59.360
RIGHT NOW- BUT THAT WOULD HELP.

03:18:59.427 --> 03:19:00.595
OKAY ISSUES BUT I THINK I'M

03:19:00.662 --> 03:19:04.165
GONNA THE ISSUE- I- MISTER

03:19:04.232 --> 03:19:06.134
FINANCIAL- DIDN'T JUST HELP WITH

03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:08.636
THE WHO THE DISTRICTS WE HAVE

03:19:08.703 --> 03:19:10.104
HAD CHALLENGE WITH- PERSISTENT.

03:19:10.171 --> 03:19:11.906
AND ISSUES BY COULD HAVE BEEN

03:19:11.973 --> 03:19:14.042
CHANGED A LOT AFTER THAT WORK

03:19:14.108 --> 03:19:15.076
FIFTEEN IN WROTE ONE YOU USE THE

03:19:15.143 --> 03:19:16.811
VIDEO ONLY SEEING IS A KIND OF

03:19:16.878 --> 03:19:18.513
AND OF STUDENTS IN OUR SYSTEM.

03:19:18.579 --> 03:19:20.648
OKAY THANK YOU SO MAYBE A-

03:19:20.715 --> 03:19:21.916
DIRECTIVE YOU IS IF YOU COULD-

03:19:21.983 --> 03:19:22.784
WHY IF YOU COULD GIVE US MORE

03:19:22.850 --> 03:19:23.351
FOR ABOUT THAT NOW. EIGHTIES

03:19:23.418 --> 03:19:24.352
POLICY TO IN WHAT THE ISSUES

03:19:24.419 --> 03:19:25.753
BEHIND OR AND HAPPENED BUT I.

03:19:25.820 --> 03:19:26.954
THINK ABOUT ANY RECOMMENDATIONS

03:19:27.021 --> 03:19:28.990
YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE US RELATED

03:19:29.057 --> 03:19:31.926
TO- THE- ACTUAL ADA AND ROMAN

03:19:31.993 --> 03:19:33.628
GOING FORWARD SELF YOU CAN COME

03:19:33.695 --> 03:19:35.496
BACKTO US IN THE FUTURE. THEN I

03:19:35.563 --> 03:19:36.831
WANTED TO ASK I KNOW FIRST WHAT

03:19:36.898 --> 03:19:38.099
WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT

03:19:38.166 --> 03:19:39.967
DISTRICTS AND FINANCES BUT I

03:19:40.034 --> 03:19:44.739
DON'T WANNA LOSE TRACK ON. TRACK

03:19:44.806 --> 03:19:45.373
AT WHAT THIS MEANS TO OUR- SO.

03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:46.307
NO KIDS IN OUR SCHOOLS. IN WHAT

03:19:46.374 --> 03:19:47.508
THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS

03:19:47.575 --> 03:19:49.310
PANDEMIC AND- YOU KNOW AS MR

03:19:49.377 --> 03:19:50.912
O'DONNELL TALK ABOUT. I HAVE

03:19:50.978 --> 03:19:52.313
HERE AND I'M CERTAIN THE SPOT

03:19:52.380 --> 03:19:54.015
BONTA AS WELL WE HAVE KIDS WHO

03:19:54.082 --> 03:19:56.084
ARE GOING THROUGH THIS- SOME

03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:57.885
KIDS ARE DOING. BETTER THAN

03:19:57.952 --> 03:19:59.420
OTHERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO.

03:19:59.487 --> 03:20:01.255
WE KNOW WE KNOW THIS AND WE HEAR

03:20:01.322 --> 03:20:02.490
FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SO

03:20:02.557 --> 03:20:04.759
WE DID. PUT A LOT OF MONEY TWO

03:20:04.826 --> 03:20:07.462
YEARS AGO. INTO A LEARNING LOS

03:20:07.528 --> 03:20:08.563
BLOCK GRANT TO HELP THESE

03:20:08.629 --> 03:20:10.264
STUDENTS WHETHER IT'S- GETTING

03:20:10.331 --> 03:20:13.468
OVER THIS IN SEVERAL MONTHS OR

03:20:13.534 --> 03:20:14.435
MAYBE SEVERAL YEARS FOR SUN.

03:20:14.502 --> 03:20:17.405
KIDS TO REALLY- BOUNCE BACK. AND

03:20:17.472 --> 03:20:21.242
SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BARRIERS

03:20:21.309 --> 03:20:24.645
IN ALL THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF

03:20:24.712 --> 03:20:26.114
ONE TIME MONEY WE'VE GIVEN TO

03:20:26.180 --> 03:20:29.016
DISTRICTS FOR EXAMPLE WE HEAR A

03:20:29.083 --> 03:20:31.919
LOT THAT DISTRICTS CAN'T USE ONE

03:20:31.986 --> 03:20:34.288
TIME MONEY FOR ONGOING PERSONNEL

03:20:34.355 --> 03:20:35.823
IS NOT GOOD BUDGETING TO HIRE

03:20:35.890 --> 03:20:37.058
PEOPLE WHEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL

03:20:37.125 --> 03:20:38.459
WITH THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TWO DOWN

03:20:38.526 --> 03:20:39.727
THE ROAD. BUT IF WE'RE TALKING

03:20:39.794 --> 03:20:42.563
CPAS DOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT LIKE

03:20:42.630 --> 03:20:44.899
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- WHAT

03:20:44.966 --> 03:20:46.901
BARRIERS ARE THERE TO HAVE A

03:20:46.968 --> 03:20:49.570
DISTRICT LET'S SAY CONTRACT WITH

03:20:49.637 --> 03:20:50.972
SUTTER HEALTH OR KAISER SOME

03:20:51.038 --> 03:20:52.240
MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONER TO

03:20:52.306 --> 03:20:54.175
COME IN AND DO WORK FOR A PERIOD

03:20:54.242 --> 03:20:55.977
OF TIME AS OPPOSED TO HIRING

03:20:56.043 --> 03:20:59.847
MORE INDIVIDUALS- I I'M NOT SURE

03:20:59.914 --> 03:21:01.649
THAT WERE. THAT WERE REALLY

03:21:01.716 --> 03:21:03.551
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. THEIR

03:21:03.618 --> 03:21:05.653
REVENUES THAT WE PUT ON THE

03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:07.321
TABLE FOR DISTRICTS TO DO THE

03:21:07.388 --> 03:21:08.923
WORK THAT WE WANTED TO DO TO

03:21:08.990 --> 03:21:10.558
MOST IMPORTANTLY. MAKE A

03:21:10.625 --> 03:21:15.730
DIFFERENCE FOR KIDS. YES I THINK

03:21:15.797 --> 03:21:16.731
THAT OTHER IMPORTANT BECAUSE I

03:21:16.798 --> 03:21:18.065
THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THAT

03:21:18.132 --> 03:21:20.501
THAT IS NOT. A BIG ISSUE OVERALL

03:21:20.568 --> 03:21:21.302
WHEN YOU SEE THE AMOUNT OF

03:21:21.369 --> 03:21:22.570
FUNDING IN THE SYSTEM THERE IS A

03:21:22.637 --> 03:21:24.372
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY A

03:21:24.439 --> 03:21:26.007
LOT OF IT IS ONE TIME FUNDING. I

03:21:26.073 --> 03:21:27.074
THINK I WOULD NOTE THAT THE

03:21:27.141 --> 03:21:28.676
FEDERAL FUNDING IN PARTICULAR IS

03:21:28.743 --> 03:21:31.446
HAS A THREE YEAR. WINDOW FOR

03:21:31.512 --> 03:21:32.246
SPENDING SO I THINK THAT'S

03:21:32.313 --> 03:21:33.648
SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS WITH A

03:21:33.714 --> 03:21:34.982
GUY THIS IS NOT WHICH ONE TIME

03:21:35.049 --> 03:21:36.617
FUNDING THAT'S NOT WE'RE GONNA

03:21:36.684 --> 03:21:37.552
USE ALL THIS MONEY IN ONE

03:21:37.618 --> 03:21:38.953
PARTICULAR YEAR WE WANT TO.

03:21:39.020 --> 03:21:39.554
SPREAD IT OUT TO THE DEGREE

03:21:39.620 --> 03:21:43.357
POSSIBLE. I'M M. I THINK YOU

03:21:43.424 --> 03:21:45.526
KNOW WE PUT A CLEAR PATH YEAR IN

03:21:45.593 --> 03:21:46.160
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THOSE ARE THE

03:21:46.227 --> 03:21:47.662
COMPANY BE PROVIDED. A LOT OF

03:21:47.728 --> 03:21:48.463
STUDENTS WEREN'T EVEN IN THE

03:21:48.529 --> 03:21:51.165
CLASSROOM SO IT MAKES SENSE FOR

03:21:51.232 --> 03:21:52.033
YOU. FOR EXAMPLE. WE'RE GOING TO

03:21:52.099 --> 03:21:53.634
DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN FOR HOW

03:21:53.701 --> 03:21:56.537
TO. USE THAT FUNDING I THINK THE

03:21:56.604 --> 03:21:58.206
ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW YOU READING-

03:21:58.272 --> 03:21:59.841
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY ABOUT

03:21:59.907 --> 03:22:01.375
HOW TO SPEND ONE TIME FUNDING OF

03:22:01.442 --> 03:22:02.477
THE CHALLENGING ONE THAT WE'VE

03:22:02.543 --> 03:22:03.578
GOT THAT TYPICALLY ABOUT THE

03:22:03.644 --> 03:22:05.112
GUIDANCE THE BEST PRACTICES DO

03:22:05.179 --> 03:22:07.548
NOT USE- ONE TIME FUNDING FOR.

03:22:07.615 --> 03:22:08.783
AMONG WORK PURPOSES DO NOT USE

03:22:08.850 --> 03:22:12.487
IT TO HIR. NEW STAFF- AND THAT

03:22:12.553 --> 03:22:13.921
DAVID DEFINITELY AN ISSUE WHERE

03:22:13.988 --> 03:22:15.723
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO

03:22:15.790 --> 03:22:18.025
EITHER WHAT HAPPENED EXPIRES YOU

03:22:18.092 --> 03:22:19.827
STOCK WHICH- MEANS THAT YOU HAVE

03:22:19.894 --> 03:22:21.696
A DECLINE IN YOUR PROGRAM AND-

03:22:21.762 --> 03:22:23.564
YOU MIGHT WANT TO. MAINTAIN THE

03:22:23.631 --> 03:22:25.600
STAFF FROM OVER THE LONG RUN TO

03:22:25.666 --> 03:22:27.568
