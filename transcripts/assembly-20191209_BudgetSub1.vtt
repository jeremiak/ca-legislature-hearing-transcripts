Joining us today. Welcome

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:42.542
To our with us here today to.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:46.212
Serve as panelists as a temp

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.779
stand the complexities or

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.346
mental health care fund our

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:47.980
state. This will be again today

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:48.948
when he- we're not. The

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.251
proposition. Sixty three and

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:56.923
the of mental health funding in

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:58.624
California. Mental health

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.094
please enter a plea is the

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.762
lives of every one in ours.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.997
People's ability to function

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:06.833
and carry out their normal

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.837
activities in life. They are

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:11.404
often compounded by stigma

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.573
making it hard for people to

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.073
talk openly about their

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.343
experiences and this is

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.810
particularly true for

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.812
communities of color. The one

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.949
in six Californians experience

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:23.583
some mental illness. Not only

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.120
do a sixth of California. And

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.756
some mental illness but one

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:30.389
every twenty four has a mental

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:33.559
illness so serious it becomes

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:34.160
difficult for them to function

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:38.931
in daily. Individuals with.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:39.432
Mental illness have life

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:43.436
expectancies twenty five

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:43.936
shorter than the average

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:45.204
population. Twenty five years

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:51.144
shorter mental health issues

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.811
prevent men of health issues it

00:06:51.878 --> 00:07:03.389
is the leading more towards.

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:04.857
The other social determinants

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:05.391
of health we know so well

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:07.126
office. Hold and people are

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:14.767
struggling to get. Increased

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.769
substance abuse addiction. And

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:17.403
oversee the stats and alarming

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.040
in in. We never get worse is

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:21.641
invested in both can and will

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:22.775
help treatment approximately

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.744
thirteen and a half million

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:25.278
Californians are currently

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:27.380
enrolled in medical program

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:29.348
which guarantees mental health

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:32.985
care to those who need it.

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:38.524
Moreover only six to seven of

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.961
California's. Population lacks

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:42.829
health insurance any kind. Of

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:45.198
mental health laws have adopted

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:46.833
federal and- to ensure we

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.202
invest hundreds of millions of

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.003
dollars of mental health

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.504
services act dollars in

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.005
prevention and early

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:57.410
intervention however even with

00:07:57.476 --> 00:08:00.179
such significant investments

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:00.746
major issues exist. With the

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:06.786
current. I'll be highlighted I.

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:09.188
Believe that we need to tackle

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:09.722
our current mental health

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.092
crisis. To bring most advanced

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.961
forms of care to scale across

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.896
the state. We need the

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:19.699
political will necessary to

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:24.337
elevate brain illness as a top

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:30.910
tier priority. Today. Based

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:33.412
mental health system. Since

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:37.350
well and where the system can

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:41.187
improve I am eager to learn

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:41.787
from our parts on the ways in

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.956
which we can work towards

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.959
achieving together just and

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.961
equitable mental health care

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:49.595
fund estimates. In this hearing

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:52.965
will explore. Three and

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:53.566
successes and its challenges

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:54.834
prevention and early

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:57.169
intervention we will revisit

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:59.038
prop sixty three in

specifically discussed and

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.842
outcomes based model. And

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.944
finally and certainly not least

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.946

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:05.731

00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:08.701
And we got ten million dollars

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:12.938
Stanislaus county secretary I

colder's to actually produce

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:38.631
publicly understood outcomes

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:40.966
that if the shock the

legislature they sure made them

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:46.839
a very happy because they

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:47.339
demonstrated significant

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:50.076
reductions in. In business

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:52.745
looking at the end jewel's year

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:55.314
before entering services and

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.982
the nine months or so after

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.652
significant reduction days of

00:11:59.718 --> 00:12:02.721

psychiatric hospitals.

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:06.025
Significant reduction in a rest

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:08.794
in days spent in jail because.

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.930
Probably understood outcomes

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:11.530
the next year when the budget

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:15.334
was still in good shape. We did

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:15.935
a B. twelve thirty four and

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:18.904
were able to increase the

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.740
amount of funding to fifty five

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:22.341
million dollars. Now for the

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:26.912
year. Two thousand and one

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:29.148
through the next great

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:30.950
reception in two thousand nine

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:31.584
when I was M. despite too much

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.085
in debt. Terms of the state

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:35.454
budget. No guy ever saw to cut

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:39.225
AB twenty thirty four because

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.193
once again fifty five million.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.930
In thirty plus counties in one

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:50.636
city I believe Berkeley. That

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.938
prod demonstrated. Consistent

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:56.442
positive and I say again easily

00:12:56.509 --> 00:13:03.015
public. Comes. Negative

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:07.219
outcomes that were taxing the

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:07.853
sit them in in huge waves. The

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.221
late rusty see looks and I

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.323
decided midway through that

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.125
period of time that well we

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:14.927
were very happy with the

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:17.530
results with fifty five million

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:21.300
dollars helping about five

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.835
thousand people a year. Was

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:25.771
obviously just a drop in the

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:26.405
bucket and the a B. two thirty

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:31.544
reserve covering up prevention

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.111
early intervention or any of

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:35.114
the. X. of untreated mental. He

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:37.917
did props three and you know

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.419
this. Right all the

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:41.053
stakeholders together raise the

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.122
minimum amount of money

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:45.124
necessary for initiative and in

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:45.691
two thousand four got fifty

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:46.325
three bus burst the vote passed

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:50.129
prop sixty three. I submit to

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:57.203
you that. The story is told

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.703
about the mental health

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.940
services act. To me in it has

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:02.908
been a great success get you

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:07.980
can and I. Innovation a systems

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:08.547
began to be transformed and

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:11.717
most importantly of real people

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:14.520
in the tens of thousands who

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:15.921
have got that bond and whatever

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:19.758
it takes in addition to the

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:22.595
generally. Can strategies it.

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:29.468
Test. And yet if it had had.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.069
Porsche fifteen if we're gonna

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:36.508
be on. We did not apple eight

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:37.109
eight B. thirty four AB twenty

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:40.679
before. What kind of reporting

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:46.986
to. The public in the state the

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:50.789
outcomes. And it's a bit. Take

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:57.363
as much responsibility as

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:57.963
anyone because we got started

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.967
with this thing back in two and

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:04.136
five into. The checks but

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.070
because in part. I think. This

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:13.012
says. In addition is a two step.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:23.422
They sort of pushed way and.

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:34.333
Take a course. French attitude

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.504
towards they see it not putting

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.505
words in their mouth. I'm

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:44.910
selves but as a catalyst or to.

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:48.947
Combined with a real pretty.

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:49.481
Reform and being a single

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:55.220
system. It is so when I look at

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:57.923
the MHSAA part of the whole

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:02.761
number little than just these

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:03.329
couple is that okay should I

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:05.130
just. Okay you have the floor

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:08.600
okay. I'm sensitive to I think

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:11.870
that you put ME aimed me in

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:13.205
context in some ways it's been

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:15.574
it's short comings have been

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:20.045
blamed for some of the first to

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:26.618
the mat health system but in

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:27.219
truth the MHSAA it's actually

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:29.121
one of five sept mental health.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.056
Got a major city we have we-

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:35.861
bottom. Jails. Yeah we've got

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:37.796
Medicare managed care and we've

00:16:37.863 --> 00:16:43.035
got commercial pay. And all of

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:45.904
those disturbance act in it

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:53.846
indirect. Integration and how

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:55.748
we put all the massive sources

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:56.348
are potentially if we had real

00:16:56.415 --> 00:17:02.421
parity by the way. Master sword

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:02.988
under a single umbrella say

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:07.226
what it take. It in there too

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:10.529
often Commons story from people

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:12.564
across all what say don says.

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:16.402
For themselves loved one what

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:20.205
ages pays room all of. Well in

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:25.677
part because of. The lack of

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:26.311
real parity and I don't when I

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:30.716
talk about parity I don't. It's

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:33.318
versus three visits for ten

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.621
visits to a therapist I mean

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:40.426
what's covered and what's not

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:42.194
covered. A lot of the nation.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:42.928
Brown street and in some ways

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:47.666
not cover. By and large kommer.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.201
HSA in part is had to be.

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:54.440
Peanut butter. If you will

00:17:54.506 --> 00:18:01.079
spread rather Finley across a

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:01.647
lot of different probes any

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:04.416
tips. And as a result not that

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:07.352
focus you spoken about in the

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:12.791
F. rations this hearing. My

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:25.671
what. The whole issue to. Did

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:30.309
the day it was a whole. Thanks

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:36.949
to flee. It is for the act. I

00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:39.318
know some of these are. The 90%

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:43.655
of the full service partnership

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:44.156
dollars on on sheltered

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:47.726
homelessness brought on by a

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:48.260
lot of different popular

00:18:48.327 --> 00:19:02.174
contain. A to a senior to tell.

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:02.774
Other counties John Sheridan

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:05.777
did in Los Angeles county that

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:06.378
while they're doing with their

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:10.983
full service partnership there.

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:12.651
I would. Like the MHS focused

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:15.254
on three categories. Help your

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.158
home there are so most

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:20.692
important imperative it's

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:22.828
getting. A roof I've been very

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:28.100
publication know about. All I

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:30.269
hate to a room full ones

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.471
permanent housing first

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:33.071
navigation center and shelter

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:36.008
is necessary but we have a

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:38.277
tough public policy in this

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:43.682
says it's okay for people to

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:44.283
live out doors. I don't think

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:44.917
it it. As you said twenty five

00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:49.154
years. Bless I know it same for

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:49.755
people with untreated chronic

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:53.892
mental this. Would like to see

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:56.762
twenty focused on unsure

00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:58.864
homelessness on ale. Yeah

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:01.733
diversion and after your for-

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.302
leaked down by the way there's

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.270
a huge laugh. The most problem

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:07.673
and then on kids and I pick

00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:08.273
four categories in the you're

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.610
just mine. Trauma based care

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:15.614
for kids exposed to violence.

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:16.181
The psychosis identification

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.917
and intervention for teenage.

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:19.484
College based mental health

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:23.855
services an intense amount in

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:27.125
the mental health services for

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:27.726
kids child our system for your

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:28.327
kids. I would like to see the

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:30.862
money spent on that. And then

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:34.099
to see an outcome based system

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:38.437
at. Yeah rich but as simply

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:41.840
understood is the eight four

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:46.345
outcome based system the

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:56.955
counties are responsible. Out

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:57.522
comes around the money. And

00:20:57.589 --> 00:21:01.627
then. For their complete flex

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:02.227
the lady and break the eighty

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:07.799
S. held accountable for outcome.

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:08.367
And I would use if you were

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:13.005
back in the get into the. The

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:14.740
books. Here the framework of

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:22.614
the eight X. thirty six what

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:23.215
was a transformative act. It

00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:25.283
created an outcome I'm for it

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.755
chop. I would if not making

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:32.891
progress comes date. Gradually

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:33.425
beginning with technical

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:38.163
assistance whatever assistance

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.764
is needed help them meet those

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.632
outcomes and go. Lee with the

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:45.470
potential never to be used. Of

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:48.840
us of St. Tension and to go

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:50.776
over the county was not doing

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:52.778
anything or spending money on

00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:53.412
other than what. The outcomes.

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:57.616
Required. What I think we need

00:21:57.683 --> 00:22:00.886
to do not how and pay for this

00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:01.520
this is currently covered under

00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:11.296
the MHSAA. The MHSAA. That's

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:11.897
reform of the image to say in

00:22:11.963 --> 00:22:12.764
my view needs to be. Discussion

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:14.800
if we can gain those additional

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:15.300
forces either from the

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:19.805
insurance companies and or the

00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:20.706
federal government we can then

00:22:20.772 --> 00:22:24.342
insure that we're not doing any

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:26.745
harm in making the M. essay.

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:27.345
Which more focused and outcome

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:31.983
based. What it is to do now we

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:37.355
believe we can do some of this

00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:38.824
legislates a some of it. Can be

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.526
done through executive order

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:45.363
eventually might. Be done. I

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.931
don't want to take the money

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:46.565
from the counties I would like

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:47.099
I think the companies do a

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:49.167
great job. But I think between

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:51.169
the state and the fifteen years

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:53.171
we've gotten away. From the

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:55.006
fundamental principle of AB

00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:56.942
twenty thirty four and twenty

00:22:57.008 --> 00:22:59.644
thirty four. Where we report to

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.446
the public consistently. That

00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:04.950
these dollars are actually

00:23:05.016 --> 00:23:05.484
saving a lot also giving

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.918
taxpayers. That's part of

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:09.821
busting stigma by the way as

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:11.223
well because people feel like

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:14.593
all my god what is the money

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:15.293
big reserves here this that and

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.964
the other. Into a consistent

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.767
about presenting outcome. Gonna

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:22.367
believe that homelessness for

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:26.872
exam. Isn't we know do if we

00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:29.174
only do a solid eight resources

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:31.109
in a way that achieve the

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:31.643
outcomes that we all will.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.846
Thank thank you and- we are

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:36.915
used to senators not having

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:37.549
time limits chocolate in place

mental health services act to

00:23:57.068 --> 00:23:59.204
along with. The late resi Felix

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:01.106
both of you giants in the field

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:01.706
of mental health thank you so

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:05.610
much for your work. It's true

00:24:05.677 --> 00:24:06.178
that. That mental health

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:07.779
advocates for claim that we are

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:08.180
in the midst of an

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:11.550
unprecedented mental health

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:13.251
crisis. Nationwide service. Are

00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:16.955
up and in California too few

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:17.556
children are being treated for

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:18.023
their mental illness.

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:21.459
Depression and anxiety- up when

00:24:21.526 --> 00:24:22.093
Californians walk out of their

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.695
homes they are confronted the

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:24.696
brute brutal in humanity.

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:31.369
Thousands of their neighbors

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:35.373
living on the streets. Intent.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:35.907
X. many whom struggle with

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:39.978
substance use disorders a

00:24:40.045 --> 00:24:41.146
mental illness. In the face of

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:43.014
these challenges the reeds

00:24:43.081 --> 00:24:45.283
reports and serve MHS dollars.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.920
How it civil that forward in

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:49.554
the image as a fourteen years

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:53.191
ago if this is the state of the

00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:56.561
world. Have we failed. A friend

00:24:56.628 --> 00:25:04.069
now a resounding. The successes

00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:04.703
of the ME all around us hiding

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:14.946
in plain sight. Today bridging

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:15.547
the images say to the tune of

00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:16.014
almost billion federal

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:18.984
financial. While at the same

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.086
time the fact is that it's a-

00:25:21.152 --> 00:25:22.954
money. These sorts of

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:24.990
interventions include

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:27.726
prevention not paid for by

vacation of. Landlord trip so

00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:50.715
important. Full part of this

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:52.984
partnership. Employment and

00:25:59.157 --> 00:26:03.228
ride alongs with law

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:03.795
enforcement we train them on

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:09.167
how to better engage our client.

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.703
Impart their live experience.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:15.407
H. meant find practices his

00:26:15.473 --> 00:26:19.044
portent in a state. This. Are

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.080
there any roles with in my

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:23.982
house the uninsured who are

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:27.352
covered by our services and yes

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:30.488
individuals with private

00:26:30.555 --> 00:26:33.825
commercial coverage. Who have

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:34.459
been announced for understood.

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:37.796
Despite the preemie they've- we

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:41.866
fund research you are an HSA

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:45.870
dollars and so much I literally

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:47.706
could go on. So I'll start to

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:53.745
describe it more of the con. I

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:57.515
like senator. Where the a

00:26:57.582 --> 00:26:59.718
discussion today. Helps to

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:02.887
point us to. Just they were

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:03.488
experiencing at staff is also

00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:07.225
aired some. Which the pass up

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:07.826
out to supplement my talking

00:27:07.892 --> 00:27:12.230
points we do start a. Many

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:14.899
years ago and orders are sought

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:19.704
help us address a man on the

00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:22.874
eve of the great budget wrist.

00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:27.278
The early ops we. Twenty two

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:27.879
thousand six and the recession

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:29.381
was just about. Without lower

00:27:29.447 --> 00:27:31.483
than they are today around two

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:33.618
and fifty six million total

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:36.554
state wide and yes today there

00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:39.424
are around two point four in I

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.494
will note that just two years

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.029
ago in twenty seven. We were

00:27:44.095 --> 00:27:48.066
receiving around one point

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.568
seven billion HSA today at two

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:53.405
point four. Stress it speaks to

00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:57.876
the relative of and what kind

00:27:57.942 --> 00:28:01.813
of today- but those changes

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.447
well and so often counties are

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:05.050
let trying to reach again it

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:07.218
might happen next and wanting.

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:07.819
They were able to sustain the

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:11.022
rams. In the years of any real.

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:14.993
Many of the N. MHSAA the MHSAA

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.961
basically saved our public

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:18.696
safety net from being decimated

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:21.366
not only did we back fill the

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:23.435
state director as the state

00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:25.570
directed us to in the budget

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:27.172
process but the state also so

00:28:27.238 --> 00:28:29.374
close to a billion an image as

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:31.309
a revenues into the state

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:34.979
general fund was a top of truth

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:37.082
is. In California and so.

00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:39.350
Justified the court to come out

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:40.952
of the Great Recession we

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.787
encounter several additional

00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:45.356
major changes to the public

00:28:45.423 --> 00:28:46.024
behavioral health system that I

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:49.160
think are noteworthy the first

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:49.761
one twenty eleven realignment

00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:50.829
which brings with a

00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:53.164
responsibility to find EPS D.

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:54.866
T. mental health services for

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:57.502
children and youth the

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:57.969
implementation of the

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:00.772
affordable Care Act which adds

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:06.945
many many. New medic I'll

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:07.545
enrollees both are. Parolees.

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:09.380
Also people who work previous

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:10.882
one not enrolled. And the

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:14.486
within DHS the elimination of

00:29:14.552 --> 00:29:18.223
the department of health on top

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:20.558
of. The changes but since the

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:23.128
Great receptacle and pulled. Up

00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:26.764
to what's work. Compliant and

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:30.802
faithful to the act- we have

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:33.438
implemented with great fidelity

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:34.038
to the regulatory and fiscal

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:35.773
rules that have been laid out

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.841
for us we've maximized the

00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:39.244
funding I we've incredibly

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:43.448
successful at breeding funding

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:46.784
and leveraging. The MHSAA and

00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:48.987
that's really how it is spread

00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:51.089
and did two is a- as I said

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:53.124
earlier it's now can trip.

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.692
Around two billion dollars and

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:59.764
as money to medic cow- end this

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:00.698
doesn't factor in the non medic

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:05.603
hal reimbursed services onto

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:09.107
the MHSAA and there are some.

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:09.741
Peter is that it be working big

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:13.912
public health and. What

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:18.750
optional. A high and mighty top.

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:21.586
No fast as the national rate.

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:22.220
First city and also cultural

00:30:22.287 --> 00:30:25.423
relevance- it's really

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.957
important in a state like

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:30.495
California that we do invest in

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:35.200
making sure that our services

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:35.733
are more cold culturally

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.334
appropriate and wall could do

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:41.005
more. The fact that we. HSA has

00:30:41.072 --> 00:30:41.573
out as to innovate in this.

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:42.874
Better the culture an early

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:45.310
this program for a county that

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:46.711
targets the meat Steckel

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:48.713
community we have a community

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.715
garden project that helps

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:51.249
reduce stigma for the mom

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:53.885
community to come in to

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:57.255
services and in San Bernadino

00:30:57.322 --> 00:30:57.822
approach program that builds

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:58.323
trust with homeless and-

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:02.827
jewel's. Traveling veterinarian

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:03.394
who support their pets and

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:05.063
helps bring into services. This

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:06.664
is ground breaking an effect.

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:08.900
On prevention without the MHSAA

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:12.337
we would not be able to do

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:12.971
anything to fund prevention and

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:16.140
stigma reduction typically not

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:16.641
covered under insurance

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:21.946
including. Where diagnosis and.

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:25.717
Acuity requirements must be met

00:31:25.783 --> 00:31:33.891
in this on reimbursable. On the

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:41.499
part for those individuals who

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:43.835
.

00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:44.402
We would argue that the service

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:48.973
partnership model. The seat has.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:49.607
We've been doing it for over a

00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:52.710
decade now in California and

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:54.946
we've gone beyond my cal the

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:55.580
bronze McCourt Dale act blouse-

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:57.115
requires us to serve

00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:59.117
individuals regardless of

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:02.887
pairing California but only to

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:03.488
the extent that resources are

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:06.157
available and we would argue

00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:10.395
that without revenue we really

00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:10.995
wouldn't be able to. Catch to

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:11.596
try to meet those. So what's

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:22.707
wrong. Not done a great job

00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:23.341
they are so and I hope that and

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:34.485
today. Hope to that. Loud.

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:35.119
Ported in one county or another

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:41.793
through the any to stay. How is

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:43.461
this moving the needle state.

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:44.062
Wide what about the store and

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:48.966
we can't stop active. Hold up

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:50.835
in state level and at this

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:51.436
importing this requires a few

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:53.204
things we need to make a state

00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:54.906
entity responsible for this

00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:57.241
this is a matter of investment

00:32:57.308 --> 00:32:59.077
and clarifying the rules of

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:04.449
ours to state regulators we

00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:05.049
need to use the data that the

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:05.616
counties are sending to the

00:33:05.683 --> 00:33:09.854
state even that will change

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:12.657
like making the reports that we

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:13.224
the second machine readable.

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:13.691
Could help open up the

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:22.667
thousands of. Nations counties

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:26.304
have struggled the most. And

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:26.938
what is new in the early the a

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:28.573
season up strict

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:29.073
interpretations of what

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:29.674
constituted an innovation were

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:36.981
extremely. As was approval

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:38.850
process thanks to our

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:39.417
leadership at the- this has

00:33:39.484 --> 00:33:40.017
changed but smaller counties

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:41.018
trouble- in that their

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:43.187
allocations are so small that

00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:46.524
it makes it almost impossible

00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:53.564
for them to lift up a group

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:54.165
program. Flexibility park how

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:58.636
can you my name. Is. A

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:00.138
wonderful in that it requires

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:00.705
us to engage communities and

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:06.677
develop three year. Update

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:07.278
brown how we spend our funding

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:07.879
in several. Be easily from one

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:12.216
complete. In the years before

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:14.752
we had greater flexibility your

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:20.491
evasions the significant. Issue

00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:24.162
when it county allocates. But

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:24.796
the funding each pop no percent

00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:28.266
of our make. HM I 8% is not

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:30.168
where we talk about on CS and

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:33.504
50% that goes to FSP design

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:35.673
what this means practically.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.044
Even if our community part. To

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:42.180
invest more works. Job we're

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:49.153
limited and can put their. Its

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:49.720
restriction along with the

00:34:49.787 --> 00:34:50.354
inability to back to our story

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:51.756
that assignment Bracey together

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:53.524
we do need to move to a- small.

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:54.125
Our counties of said give us

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:54.725
the targets and we will meet

00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:55.860
them at the trade off for

00:34:55.927 --> 00:35:02.867
greater flexibility. Second

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.302
district in that. We cannot use

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:07.705
HSA funds on substance

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:08.272
disorders this is important

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:09.140
clearly the thing that the- as

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:15.146
this crisis with an HSA funds.

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:15.746
You would know as a clinician

00:35:15.813 --> 00:35:18.082
talked her out I'm glad that

00:35:18.149 --> 00:35:18.683
often. A person is struggling

00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:26.324
with addiction. Really hard to

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.991
tell what the underlying mental

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:29.060
illness. They're dealing with

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.495
it is and until we can engage

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:31.062
them and bring them services

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:34.131
for their substance use to. It

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:34.799
is very difficult what's going

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:39.003
on there I'm are finding really

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.805
categoric Janet and I am

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:44.408
actually. Into play it out safe

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:51.749
as well. We have to. Funding

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:52.383
under SB eighty two which help

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.652
the price. No place like home

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:58.789
our recent today since their

00:35:58.856 --> 00:35:59.357
ships are work force through

00:35:59.423 --> 00:36:01.659
the M. say. He competed one

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:03.628
county to another for a finite

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:06.564
pot of funding and then we end

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.231
up with differences from one to

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:10.902
the other not based on- what

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:12.937
makes the most sense or are

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:13.571
does this CD six every. One who

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:15.573
was able to compete for those

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.341
for a resource and went out I

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:18.976
would say that we need to level

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:24.248
set our expectations me to say

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:26.951
given how widespread the needs

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:31.088
are for. Health safety net what

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:32.823
role should the MA to say in

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.892
that and that begs the

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:39.997
question. In two day in medic

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:44.235
cow overall working 25% of

00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:48.005
budget for Medicare. Yes mental

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:52.310
illness the image is only 25%

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:54.712
And I'm only 5% is. The only

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:55.246
source of that we have for

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:57.782
important activities of medic

00:36:57.848 --> 00:37:04.855
cow so for two to an outcomes

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:05.489
based system how will medic how

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:08.926
be aligned. To support those

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.761
comes run counter to them.

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:14.799
White outcomes. Is that the M.

00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:15.399
HSA supports our behavioral

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:16.968
health system is staggering

00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:19.070
it's everywhere from providing

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:20.705
critical investments in

00:37:20.771 --> 00:37:21.272
prevention and early invent

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:23.007
intervention all the way

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:30.781
through to providing critical

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:34.518
support to the crisis. And a

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.152
cute ends of the continuum and

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:38.155
everything in between. If sure

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:40.858
these dollars work well. Of the

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:41.492
various about thank you for the

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:44.895
opportunity. Thank you and

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:45.496
we'll save questions for the

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:46.964
and if that's okay- doctor

today glad to be here to speak

00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:58.275
on behalf of the

00:37:58.342 --> 00:37:59.076
administration- and again

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:03.114
appreciate your time and glad

to be here. With me stop Bergen

00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:04.849
and others on the panel.

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:11.455
Behavioral health substance use

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:13.257
disorders. Is a critical

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:14.792
element of individual and

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:15.459
community well being a governor

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:16.761
who some. Believe that all.

00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:18.929
Your health services that they

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:21.032
need to live to live happy

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:23.167
healthy and fulfilling lives.

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.269
Proposition sixty three of the

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:28.739
other panelists I've already

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:29.407
mentioned is a key part of that

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:35.613
the mental health services act

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.213
is produced high quality. Shin

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:43.120
and programs. Let's MHM things

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:43.621
that's true we've we've

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.289
discussed that already it's

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:45.823
also an ambitious policy

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:46.323
framework for providing

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.191
comprehensive community based

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:49.593
systems of care in all of the

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.696
above approach or strategy for

00:38:51.762 --> 00:39:02.440
mental health- again it

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:03.007
includes prevention earlier.

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:03.574
Talked about these different

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:10.514
elements of. Repent and others

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:11.082
are supportive services that

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:11.849
are needed also. In sure tan

00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:16.754
de. Gusman two other funding.

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:17.354
Mental health services and of

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:18.856
all been middle. Communities

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:19.490
I'm in water community wellness

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:20.925
goals that we have. The

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:22.793
financing streams are

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.360
structured though as we've

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:24.995
heard- and they they are

00:39:25.062 --> 00:39:25.563
supportive of all of those

00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:26.997
different names but with

00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:30.935
different sort of structures

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:31.469
and restrictions that are

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:36.507
attached with them. Eight

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:37.108
twenty related to services and

00:39:37.174 --> 00:39:44.148
prevention and- in those. Both

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:49.286
of us service ports. Full part

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:49.854
of full service partnership

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.392
model. Current estimate it did

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:57.895
an HSA will generate over two

00:39:57.962 --> 00:39:58.429
dollars Avenue during this

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.831
fiscal year that is in. Them

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:07.371
middle service delivery.

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:08.005
Systems I kept up a billion we

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:08.672
heard today. Port that a lot of

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:09.206
that money also spent on

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.941
medical funded services which

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:11.542
is an effective strategy of up

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:13.010
actually in large. And in our

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:15.146
communities through accessing

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:17.348
federal Medicaid matching funds

00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:18.916
with an HSA dollars. In

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:22.052
addition a broad nature of the

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:22.920
community services and supports

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:26.290
component of an HSA enables-

00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:35.232
counties as we as we heard to

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:35.833
support many services that are

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.905
also not funded through medico.

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:42.740
And the list. We're seeing

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:43.307
across the state right now-

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:46.443
images a services is helped

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:51.916
have also help consumers reduce

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:52.483
involvement in the criminal

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.050
justice system. And create

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:59.089
community. Input I mean there

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:00.424
is the doctor five. For the

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:02.760
deputy director of the

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:03.327
department of health this is

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:04.962
we'll talk about in the next

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.997
battle as well. I mean to say

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:09.233
both enables the medical

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:09.800
program. More bust impact in

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:13.170
this way that. Rapper the two.

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:14.872
Or could back in unity- wide

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:15.472
and human centered impact in

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:15.973
terms of mental health

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:16.540
services. Speaking of our

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:18.542
communities I think one of the

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:19.176
really innovative and valuable

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:19.743
aspects of an HSA is it's

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:20.811
intentional route- in

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:21.378
community. And the community

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:23.080
planning process. Increased to

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:25.316
culturally and specifically

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:26.650
linguistic services- in is

00:41:26.717 --> 00:41:29.320
truly unique in that fashion

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:29.920
and it's a requirement written

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:33.591
into the statute into the law-

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:34.225
in some images say is special

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:34.758
in that Californians have

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:38.729
chosen to raise this revenue.

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:39.363
Have voted in favor of this act

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.432
and really or ties health

00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:43.367
wellness mental health and

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:45.102
wellness. By a vote for this

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:47.438
the side proposition. As I said

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:48.105
at the beginning. Of the law is

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:51.375
much more that funding source

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:51.976
it's ultimately about impact.

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.310
Enabling people to look healthy

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:55.546
full lives. Up speaking just a

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:57.681
little bit about the in. One

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:59.383
very prominent example again as

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.585
the full service partnership

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:05.322
model. Of intensive community

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:09.293
based out of service. Employing

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:09.894
will take approach to provide

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.464
service. Roughly two thousand

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.232
people as of November second of

00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:16.634
this year or- in- in. Our

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.234
programming as we call it. And

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:17.835
that includes twelve thousand

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.036
children up to the age of

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:19.570
fifteen. Thirteen thousand

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:21.338
transitional age with twenty

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:25.576
six thousand adults and seventy

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:26.210
five hundred older adults above

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:34.618
the age of sixty. And that that

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:35.185
service side that service-

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:38.489
mock. Actually supporting some

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:39.023
really I think tremendous-

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:40.991
innovative programming counties

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:41.525
just two examples of that

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:42.092
instead Luis Obispo captives

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:44.428
of. Treatment that provide

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:45.062
services to individuals who are

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:47.464
on formal probation for a

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:52.970
minimum of. Two years and. For

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:53.604
whom mental health treatment is

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:54.104
been a fat burner legal

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.173
different difficult. Program so

00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:01.178
it's not mandatory. And there

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:01.779
are there are folks who have

00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:02.379
not been seen by other systems

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:05.015
previously so. For decide

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:07.384
discharge from jail and not

00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:09.687
engaged in services in a timely

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:11.388
fashion- in addition St Bernard

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:17.127
you know county has a very

00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:17.695
innovative. Transitional age

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:24.301
youth- behavioral health

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:24.935
hostile model called the state.

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:25.536
This was a particularly entry

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:30.374
model. So treatment for. Me

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.176
ages it. Or it's a short term

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:33.744
bond crisis residential center

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:38.983
for those X. psychiatric

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:41.151
episode- Christ's the program

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:41.719
bases itself and therapeutic

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:44.922
community design. And since it

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:46.890
also has- impressive-

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:48.692
interdisciplinary model in

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:49.259
plain sight yet psychiatric

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:51.095
nursing social service and

00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:52.796
vocational services- some

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:56.934
outcomes that are impressive-

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:57.534
29% of the youth who presented

00:43:57.601 --> 00:44:00.004
with a significant issue

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:00.671
related to psychosis or thought

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:02.506
disturbance disturbance had

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:03.007
those issues improve or

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:09.113
resolved by district in

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:09.613
addition there's a more

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.082
holistic approach to carry. The

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:13.217
percent of presented the next

00:44:13.283 --> 00:44:15.085
significant medical or

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:15.686
otherwise physical. Issue had

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:19.923
decided. In project so with

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.557
that 5% set aside but given its

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:22.026
successes now funded and the

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:25.262
community services and

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:31.301
supports- portion let me just

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:31.869
say to support its ongoing.

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:37.174
Operation. Impact of say the

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:38.909
challenges Sir there is a

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:41.011
success is the other panel. I'd

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:43.147
metric analysis outcomes are

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:45.449
are areas that we can all work

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:46.884
on together establishing- and

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.453
enhance monitoring process to

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.758
establish statewide goals for

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:55.325
children- transitional age

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:57.728
youth adults. Older adults and

00:44:57.795 --> 00:45:00.764
families remain important areas

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:01.365
for improvement okay currently

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:02.800
draft three your plants in it

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:03.434
based goals for. Their spending

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.069
up dollars however we could

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:05.702
benefit from a more explicit

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:10.174
statewide planning process to

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:10.741
establish what outcomes we

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:11.375
expect from the funding for the

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:16.780
programming what sort of can

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:17.281
was quality improvement

00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:17.815
analysis and evaluation we

00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:20.217
expect. And how we communicate

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:22.953
the- public and to our and how

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.922
we can. As a more coalition to

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:28.459
advance I think this is also a

00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:31.061
particular. Time of

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:31.628
opportunity- as we've heard

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:32.162
again- from the panel for

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:43.273
behave. Transmit. The

Cal. Medicaid waiver renewals

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:48.212
and- it's from the medical

00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:53.951
program. Haitian. But of

00:45:54.017 --> 00:45:57.855
Medicare reforms again signals

00:45:57.921 --> 00:46:01.258
up. And is there a opportunity

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:03.193
of for example. Of health care

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.197
services as has problems. Many

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:07.798
member risk. Percent which is

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:15.272
which again. I'll get over it

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:15.906
will determine health in middle

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:17.307
earth to. Work seamless thank

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:22.813
Chris. Three improving outcomes

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.313
driving delivery system

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.649
transformation in modernizing

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:26.216
systems and for integrating

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:28.819
behave services within the

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:29.386
broad array of help this is

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:29.953
available in our communities

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:36.727
and so. I think the terrific

00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:37.327
aspect of these goals is that

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:39.830
all I'm applied it may just. So

00:46:39.897 --> 00:46:43.734
MHD pro instate goals. No in

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.802
two both both programs impact

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:46.403
of service act that supported

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:53.143
by both of those those vehicles

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.677
coordinate service to more

fully address consumers. Person

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:01.251
fashion more I think that I may

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:01.852
just taxable all of the above

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:03.387
approach through. Aug medic out

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:08.525

miss in our expectations for it

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:25.075
and I just say how we align

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:26.977
that with Caroline we also need

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:30.214
a commitment to push toward

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:30.847
that common set of goals that

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:32.716
we agree upon and use enhanced

00:47:32.783 --> 00:47:39.122
data collection to Kitty-

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:39.756
continuously push ourselves now

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:42.259
comes in and finally. It

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:42.859
important that we don't lose

all have discussed has greatly

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:43.453
increased funding for mental

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.888

of successes and then I'll

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:07.244
examine some of the challenges

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:07.778
to implementing prop sixty

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:15.552

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:50.941
Savings associated with

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:51.475
specific components a prop

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:54.978
sixty eight. In evaluating

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:55.545
costs associated with LA

00:51:55.612 --> 00:52:00.851
county's FSP program. We found

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:01.485
that the program reduce service

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:02.085
related expenditures by eighty

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:03.820
three million dollars. Twenty

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:13.363
five that reduction. The cost

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:14.364
savings were largely to. Reduce

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:16.900
spending on a person among

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:17.501
adults although there are the

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:20.103
big. So help hospitalization

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:20.737
and homelessness we also found

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:21.204
evidence that cal mesa

00:52:21.271 --> 00:52:23.306
statewide P. I. programs you'll

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:25.141
that positive return investment

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:30.647
for example the each my matter

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:33.817
stigma reduction campaign. Is

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:34.351
associated with increased

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:34.951
treatments which is projected

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:41.358
to. Thirty six dollar return to

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:41.892
the state for every dollar

00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:43.126
invested the higher. Yeah I

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.961
program is college in unit. Our

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:45.562
system with increased use of

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:47.163
mental health treatment which

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.999
is projected to increase

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:49.533
graduation rates in turn

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.134
leading to higher lifetime

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:53.737
earnings an average return to

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:55.038
the state of six dollars for

00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:57.173
every dollar invested. Suicide

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:02.579
in training programs are also

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:07.284
projected to return money to

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:07.951
the state the reverted medi cal

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:09.019
emergency care because it's a

00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:11.221
set. Times and increase state

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.123
thank. That's benefit analyses

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:15.125
do not capture all the

00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:17.327
financial personal or societal

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:26.303
benefits improving. Our saving

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:26.836
someone's life is valuable

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:29.105
regardless of the cost. What's

00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:29.706
one limited funding for state

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:30.974
by Pierre projects. Although

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:33.076
prop sixty three has some

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.911
notable successes challenges

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:36.980
still remain some P. I.

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:37.480
programs could be more

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:39.215
efficiently implemented as a

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:43.320
statewide effort than by each

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:47.057
individual county. However

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:47.591
California's decentralized

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:48.191
county minister mental health

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:51.494
system to challenging to work

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:56.066
on projects counties only

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:57.867
contribute a. Small portion of

00:53:57.934 --> 00:53:58.435
that I funds to the comments

00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:02.806
the state. Amount has greatly

00:54:02.872 --> 00:54:03.373
how Mrs infection and then I

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.941
such. It projects at the level

00:54:05.008 --> 00:54:05.575
they were at when we conducted

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:06.910
many of these evaluations well

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:09.012
we found some promising results

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:09.579
these games have likely not

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:12.816
been fully maintained.

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:13.416
Challenge number two this is

00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:16.019
something some of the other

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.154
panelists have spoken to it

00:54:18.221 --> 00:54:18.788
well limited capacity for whole

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:30.066
person care. It's a mental

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:30.634
health the highly vulnerable

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:35.538
popular. Elation and

00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:38.174
unemployment. The criminal

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:38.742
justice system or with the

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:39.342
department of child and family

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:42.912
services. The current system is

00:54:42.979 --> 00:54:44.948
prepared to treat all of

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:45.482
people's complex it's in a

00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:47.150
coordinated manner. The because

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:49.519
it is not set up to compensate

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:50.820
whole person care to best serve

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:53.657
California to mental illness

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:55.258
California may need to develop

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:55.792
the first meant and for me

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:57.560
consist. Support whole person

00:54:57.627 --> 00:55:00.930
care all its consumers.

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:03.733
Challenge number three

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.267
insufficient county level

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:05.368
evaluation data just something

00:55:05.435 --> 00:55:07.303
again other panelists have

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:09.205
spoken to. Invite sixty three

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:11.408
funding we found that we did

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:12.976
not always have the right data

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:13.510
to answer our evaluation

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:15.211
questions for instance some key

00:55:15.278 --> 00:55:17.280
indicators of recovery from

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:19.516
serious mental illness are not

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:20.884
being measured by count is

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:21.518
another outcomes are not being

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:22.118
measured as well as they could

00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:29.826
be. California can facilitate

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:30.427
future evaluation by updating

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:30.994
it mandated data collection

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:37.167
proceed. Careful consideration

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:37.734
to be taken to minimize non

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:38.835
county mental health provider

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:39.436
one I think the utility of the

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:41.771
data collected. Thank you thank

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.173
you doctor mark finally we of

00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:43.807
course how she died from the LA

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:49.913
a. Good afternoon to the chair

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:50.580
into the- the committee- might.

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:51.114
Deal with the legislative

00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:53.550
analyst's office. There should

00:55:53.616 --> 00:55:55.685
be now a package of form the

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:58.922
basis of offices remarks today.

00:55:58.988 --> 00:55:59.456
I'm I'll be presenting on

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:01.291
several issues within a major

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:03.593
day and potential solutions to

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.596
those issues that the

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:07.197
legislature could consider to

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:08.264
improve the academic forward.

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:09.365
Before I begin I just want a

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:11.134
knowledge six is within images

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:13.803
say that a couple of our- that

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.338
couple of. Eggs on the panel

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:22.045
have spoken to- no doubt that

00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:22.679
they've absolutely. Able within

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:25.148
the act. I'll be referencing

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:25.715
pages up and- base from this

00:56:25.782 --> 00:56:28.818
page. At the circle. For me an

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:29.285
MH assays work for men

00:56:29.352 --> 00:56:31.287
component. Providing background

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:35.859
information on that funding.

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:36.426
And several options for the

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:37.060
legislature to convince her to

00:56:37.127 --> 00:56:39.329
increase funding for sports

00:56:39.395 --> 00:56:46.636
programs going forward. This

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:47.203
material the end of our hand

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.172
out. Getting on. We describe

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:51.307
the first issues let's. Relate

00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:55.145
to map out. Okay however these

00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:55.612
are often not tied to

00:56:55.678 --> 00:56:56.146
meaningful and measurable

00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:59.415
targets. There are also

00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:00.016
intended outcomes in the act

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:00.884
for different components such

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.620
as homelessness reduction under

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:04.120
the prevention and early

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:06.790
intervention component but it

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:07.357
isn't clear to what extent

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:11.194
there's an outcome based

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:11.795
strategy. That encompasses all

00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.429
of the ME they. Potential

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:13.997
solutions legislature could

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:16.032
seek to make. How come only in

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:22.071
images they are well.

00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:22.705
Developing durable targets link

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:27.110
to these outcomes. It is there

00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:27.677
the legislature identify new

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:30.947
outcomes. Was as well. And

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:33.049
finally the legislature could

00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:33.616
provide policy direction to

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:34.851
facilitate a strategy. That

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:37.187
incorporates measurable

00:57:37.253 --> 00:57:37.720
outcomes at a higher level

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:40.924
covering all of them a to say.

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:46.696
Moving to page three. We

00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:47.263
describe the next issues for

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:52.368
legislative consideration. Two

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:55.338
evaluation infrastructure. Data

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:55.972
collection and outcome measures

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:56.973
is not consistent pretenses.

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.108
This entity is responsible for

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:01.377
comprehensive evaluation

00:58:01.444 --> 00:58:01.978
functions are provided with

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:03.379
adequate resources to do so we

00:58:03.446 --> 00:58:18.862
know that images they oversight

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:20.129
responsibility. Are currently

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:20.830
split between the department of

00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:22.732
health care services and the

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:23.299
men this is all. But he can

00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:29.472
play see. What cap may be

00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:30.874
available for this purpose. The

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.474
legislature could also provide

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:31.908
policy direction on

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:34.777
infrastructure sure is. The

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:35.411
elected aligned with measurable

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:37.347
outcomes successful practices

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:38.882
can be equally shared among

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:39.482
counties and between counties

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:43.353
in the state. And that it's

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:44.988
clear what entity or entities

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:46.823
will be responsible for

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:47.457
carrying out a more rich robust

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:53.763
evaluation strategy. Moving to

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:56.466
page four we describe our last

00:58:56.532 --> 00:58:56.933
issues for legislative

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.136
consideration. To the need for

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:00.703
new. Framework to guide fun

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.273
isn't. Car and make a funding

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:05.008
is not explicit. The act

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:07.143
reflects a policy called to

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.045
prioritize treatment over

00:59:09.112 --> 00:59:09.479
prevention and early

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:10.947
intervention services the

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:12.882
inflexibility in this broad

00:59:12.949 --> 00:59:13.483
funding allocation does not

00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:15.184
allow the focus of a major same

00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:16.920
plantation to shift if new

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:17.387
information on program

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:20.890
effectiveness comes to light.

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:23.326
Potential solutions the

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.528
legislature provide policy

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:30.800
direction to develop a

00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:31.868
framework for using outcome.

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:35.171
Data. Straight to be through

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:37.273
with. They're seeking the

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.042
authority to periodically

00:59:39.108 --> 00:59:42.345
reassess funding allocations if

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:45.181
evidence. Indicates that

00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:45.748
funding should be redirected

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:47.717
toward different practices.

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:48.251
Your cooking seeking many

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:51.487
allocation to dated priorities

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:52.922
we know that it's unclear if

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:55.058
that seeking voter approval and

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:55.658
also know that care for the

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.026
duration to be given the

00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:59.162
potential trade offs if funding

00:59:59.228 --> 00:59:59.796
is redirected away from certain

00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:02.932
categories. If this is the case

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.834
alternative funding sources may

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:05.435
be needed to sustain programs

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:06.836
in those areas. Finally

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:11.374
beginning on page six. But some

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.343
background information on the

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:13.977
workforce development component

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:17.347
of an HSA as well as option for

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:17.947
increasing work force funding

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:18.982
going forward. Currently

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:22.752
Cappies can dedicate up 215% of

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:25.221
MHSAA revenue to work force

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:25.855
education and training or wet

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:29.492
grams. However the ceiling also

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:30.026
includes the total funding

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:32.061
counties may dedicate to

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:32.595
capital and technology and

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:36.199
prudent reserves. As mentioned

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.166
our hendo and in the materials

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:44.574
for this hearing. Extra in its

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.174
initial. Years fun otherwise

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:48.978
going to counties. For other

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:49.612
part was directed to five what

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:51.180
is. Figure out six described

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:51.781
types of programs these plans

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.249
addressed. After that funding

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.118
expired in seventeen eighteen

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:55.651
the legislature provided

01:00:55.718 --> 01:01:04.560
additional an HSA funds. On a

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:05.128
one time basis for what in

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:07.096
eighteen nineteen. And twenty.

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:08.031
Am I say funds- fund to fund

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:10.733
five year will. Be twenty.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.367
Counties are also now required

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:12.001
to provide thirty three per and

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:12.902
in may answer but- you're on

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:15.371
page seven describes annual

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:16.039
average what funding by fiscal

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.173
year. We know that finding

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:21.577
going forward is considerably

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:22.178
lower than fighting in the axe

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:22.845
initial years was. If the

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:23.446
legislature wishes to increase

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:27.617
funding for what programs.

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:32.422
Dedicate additional portion

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:33.022
state cap funding for this.

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:35.058
Purpose dedicate additional

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:36.793
general fund for this purpose.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:37.360
Or dedicate funding wise for

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.228
local. Done in the years of the

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:41.531
images say. With that I'll

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:42.098
conclude our offices remarks

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:45.201
thank you. The thing with that

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:46.969
just for housekeeping purposes

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:54.977
we will do public comment at

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:55.945
the end of. All of our panel

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:59.248
so- with that I will bring it

01:01:59.315 --> 01:01:59.782
up to the door and see any

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:00.416
question. Number four thank you

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:07.123
sure. So it's she the. The

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.757
expertise in which all of you.

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.158
Hi today what I'm looking for

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:12.929
is a legislator. In a fire

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:13.529
problem what is going to cost

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:17.266
and- so what you need to do to

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:21.404
fix it. I don't know I'm going.

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.673
We didn't do that. Now what

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:26.876
we're gonna do to fix the- you

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:27.510
know we always talk about if

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.312
you can does owns. Duffel with

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:33.749
yes. I want. The experts to

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:35.084
come to this legislature and

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:39.021
say if you do this and you find

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:39.589
this we will get you this.

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:45.027
Simple as that. You tell us go

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.896
with the wet we spent four

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:47.497
hundred and forty five million

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:56.038
dollars of mesa. I don't have

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:58.774
any data tells me. Or yeah how

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:02.979
much we- I already in

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.114
California in before for Reagan.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:05.648
That we did have a mental

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:11.087
health. Hospital. No we do have

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:14.891
hospitals which are prisons for

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:15.491
the criminally insane. But we

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:18.961
don't take an- consider the

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:19.529
wind DDS decommissioned the

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:27.470
DC's. The mental help take over

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.873
I spoke. Not re will assist the

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:31.407
work before was it meant

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.942
something that. Actually have.

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:38.748
How comes fun with expectations.

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:39.315
No in my county of Solano I

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:51.994
have. Beds for car. Okay. In

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:52.562
there because we were coming

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:56.999
home. My. Sosa need good prices

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:57.600
bed I think they're buying. It

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.168
in the- three hours to get

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:01.237
bounced to the- the hospital.

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:03.105
In our area. If it's a fifty

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.907
one fifty they stay for seventy

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.976
two hours or less and then

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:07.543
there. Then put into county

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:13.349
jail. Tell us what we need to

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:16.852
do to us. How much do you need.

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.055
Give us a number. And then the

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:19.655
you promise that you will fix

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:29.966
it. That's what we're looking

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:30.633
for we have Stamberg whose lead.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.904
Cold you don't need to. What

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.939
version fixes this is somebody

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:38.975
will make it a priority. To

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:42.912
help these poor people they

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:43.446
need the help that they so

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:45.715
deserve a bleak me. And we

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:46.215
don't have to have these

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:51.087
battles in. Nexus from the

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:55.091
right address he. Thank you Sam

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:59.228
remember Fraser. One of the

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.731
skills I had to learn being of

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:05.001
position was asking questions

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:07.203
and not having to because many

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.572
statements because it. Led to

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.207
you trying to understand a

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:13.909
problem that was more complex

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:17.680
than there was before us. And I

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:18.281
do want to focus a little bit

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:22.818
if I can. Feinberg as the

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:23.386
author of the mental health

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:27.990
service. With rusty see lex.

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:28.591
You said initially this was a

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:35.197
home. If. You said after four

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:35.798
teen years you and the public

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:40.636
feels it's- turn. I'm with-

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:43.072
looking to complete the round I

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:45.341
think insufficient chin

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:48.978
homelessness. Not in every

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:50.946
county in every county. The

01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:53.282
home. Say not enough the full

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:55.351
service partnership

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:59.088
requirements are broad day is

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:00.823
long as an individual that's

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.925
the definition of serious and

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:03.559
persistent mental illness they

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.829
can qualify now the people

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:07.296
receiving full service

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:07.863
partnerships if they're not

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:16.972
homeless. They are neat they.

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:17.606
They have a real neat it's not

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:18.207
to diminish in any way he'd.

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:18.841
Question that's really be the

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.509
hard question being after

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:23.245
everyone agrees on out we need

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:23.879
to have more not. Disturb think

01:06:23.946 --> 01:06:26.048
that's easy consensus and that

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:28.784
has been a shortfall if of the

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:30.920
act. The top issue though. Is

01:06:30.986 --> 01:06:33.456
whether or not the act should

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:35.057
be focused its expenditure

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:37.626
should be focused on. Several

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:40.896
things as opposed to many

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:41.430
things it's a foot off the

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:46.502
question in a way. Do you want

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:47.837
to do a few things really. Or

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:50.806
do we want to do it. All in

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:52.875
holes it throughout the stem.

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:55.010
When I say that the initiative

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:57.313
initially was thought of not

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.081
exclusively but largely around

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:02.818
the issue of homelessness. An

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:05.154
icy are ninety thousand on

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.089
sheltered homeless people in

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:12.962
California I want this act more

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:16.932
focused on on sheltered homes.

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:20.503
Though an obviously had to

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:26.542
integrate with those on this

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.177
that suffer. From serious

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:30.846
mental as enter substance abuse

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:31.414
because I agree with gel the

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.950
cold curry disorder. Make sure

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:35.518
do a refresh assembly member

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:39.155
Frasier is that it will become

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:39.688
what occurs often in the

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:40.289
legislation isn't a criticism

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:45.594
it's an observation. That every

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:46.128
stay cold or will have an

01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:47.563
outcome that they want. And

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:55.204
then you'll have the outcomes.

01:07:55.271 --> 01:08:00.843
That will create a consensus.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:01.477
And no prescription in the act

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:09.318
in it. No that wouldn't be

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:20.062
content. Do we want to billion

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:22.832
dollars do you really. On.

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:23.365
Three things as it was to

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:26.836
twenty thing. I said in my it

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:29.104
the way dressed my objective

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:31.073
what I think should be acted

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.075
jetted bout focus is to

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.844
integrate this with Calais him

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.946
and with the real parity

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:38.781
discussion and real parity

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:41.250
action the peace in cal matters

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:47.223
today about how we can even get

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:47.790
a reporting bill through the

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:51.660
legislature. Time and governor

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:52.294
really speaks to how far I have

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:57.900
to go to actually have it. But

01:08:57.967 --> 01:08:58.534
there's a lot of money you know

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:01.070
I was happy to raise. I think

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:04.740
you look. Just problem we

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.942
probably need more money but

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:09.044
this is a systems problem and

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:10.679
the systems have to work much

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:14.750
better together to meet the

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:15.284
objectives that we lay out

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:29.932
MHSAA should. Not be that what

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:30.566
was the term that somebody used

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:33.202
are. Shin the rebar at I don't

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:35.271
think. I think you should the

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.373
driving. Five towards the most

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:41.110
serious unaddressed

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.945
consequences of untreated

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:43.546
mental illness I laid out my

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:46.982
categories and people could

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:47.583
play out different categories

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:49.251
fair enough. I'm sheltered

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:54.223
homelessness people cycling in

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.492
and out of jail. And kids writ

01:09:56.559 --> 01:10:03.399
large break the kids it is

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:04.066
enough three four five category.

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:09.138
And that's. As we are to be get

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:09.772
the public knowing that they're

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:12.708
getting huge. Here necessarily

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:13.342
by the way because the lack of

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:20.416
parity in because of the lack

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:22.518
of. An aggressive way right

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:23.085
that's what I that's what I

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:23.719
think we should all be striving

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:26.789
for. You speak talk systems and

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.791
this is a physician what learn

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:30.993
body systems you're a pulmonary

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.062
cardiovascular of renal system

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:35.030
and yet you need all parts

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.032
working to stay healthy. Out of

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:39.134
my issue when looking at mental

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:41.136
health has been how fragmented

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:50.613
the system is even within mild

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:51.113
moderate and serious and

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.982
persistent. Yes and the

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:59.288
struggle that comes with that-

01:10:59.355 --> 01:10:59.922
Cabrera brought up so of being

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:00.522
substance abuse within those

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:01.890
treatments and. I do think the

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:02.458
administration is on a very

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:07.029
good. For calling him and I

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:07.563
don't mean to get ahead of

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:11.133
ourselves here. I knew then

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.868
what role mental service act

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:13.469
will plot and if I can delve

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:16.138
deeper into something you said

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:16.739
Michelle Cabrera. You said F.

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:17.373
as peas were the seed for whole

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:21.076
person care. I guess my

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:27.850
question is it and redundant if

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:30.753
we have a whole or how we.

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:35.491
Ensure that the money is our

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:36.091
big fan both quest all truly

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:36.725
comprehend what a- but what is

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:42.231
it play a role if whole person

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:42.731
care becomes a statewide

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:43.866
program an entitlement. So it

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:44.466
is very much in line with the

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:50.806
hell he- a panel but of course

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:53.108
at you know what I was. Give a

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:53.709
nod to mayor Steinberg around

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:54.877
the service partners. It takes

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:57.012
out all in that. It's been

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:57.613
around for a while it has and

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.317
based in county behavioral

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:03.852
health and with our contracted.

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:04.486
Providers or when counties are

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:05.120
running them themselves through

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:14.329
small. We are wrapping. Is

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:14.863
immensely clients with.

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.433
Whatever they need to see

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:19.034
children the help. The thing.

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:21.003
Two drivers and- our medic to

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:26.208
find a place to live get them

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:30.179
I'm. Not sure is treatment but

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:30.813
purpose so that they can hello

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:31.413
in the long run I. Have a at

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.950
some of. Until the end of life

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.952
that is nature of his chronic

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:39.054
illnesses and- but but the

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.956
prescription for that is not a

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:41.523
medical model prescriptions

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.826
solely and I do believe that

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:46.829
the rest of medic how. Is

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:49.431
stretching to try to catch up

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:50.065
with public behavioral health

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:56.405
has has had a strong foothold.

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:58.907
For some time how I think it

01:12:58.974 --> 01:12:59.475
ties back to Callie is that

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:00.909
this state I tried. Structure

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:03.112
within medic how managed care

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:04.947
plans and it will be a stretch

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:07.116
for- plans because it's not

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:09.351
really their bread and butter

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:11.553
and so counties are prepared

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.055
and willing to. Work very

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:21.096
closely with medic how managed

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:21.730
care to make sure that- complex

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:28.504
beneficiary the crop delivery.

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:34.910
Are able to benefit. From. So

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:38.714
the three the level and

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:39.348
intensity of housing services

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:42.651
and supports that we're able to

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:47.556
provide as county behavioral

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:48.157
health that's not what's being

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:51.226
provided or. Under in lieu of

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:54.730
services thank. Manage distant

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:58.734
site looking to score a win

01:13:58.801 --> 01:13:59.234
with CMS on return on

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:02.437
investment by avoided emergency

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:05.274
room visits we're really

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:05.874
looking to improve people's

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:06.942
lives and help them in their

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.144
cover in the long run and so it

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:11.079
might not be too avoided enough

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:13.182
emergency room visits to

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.017
compensate for the fact that

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:16.852
you're helping someone get an

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:19.822
education and achieve

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:20.622
employment status over the long

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:23.125
run but you've if you've helped

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:26.595
that per person find their

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:27.229
perfect. And well being than by

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:34.870
our. Our goals have been met.

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:36.972
So I think. Are some unique I'm

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.907
I think one of the- a better

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.076
grade girl health. Support

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:41.677
systems not just our health

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:42.878
system but our public safety

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:52.888
child welfare education. And

01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:53.388
other systems much more

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:53.922
effectively. Again we're

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:54.423
already there we need to

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:59.761
improve how. Systems and I just

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:04.733
feel. Part discussion and my

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.300
calc framed the been about

01:15:05.367 --> 01:15:06.935
getting to work with our

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:07.536
partners and so now we're in

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:10.239
here my meaning to try to

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:10.839
challenge but to say that. We

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:12.608
have opportunity to try to make

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:17.913
improvements as well you have

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.547
found if I keep. This one more

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:19.114
question and pass it off to

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:22.951
someone. I wanted to ask the

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:23.585
infrastructure. To switch were

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:25.020
a key component early on with

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:25.654
then MHSAA. But seem as if they

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:29.124
have not. Continue to receive

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:38.600
funding while. They're still a

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:39.167
need for a diverse workforce

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:40.569
and more bets. One are the

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:42.204
property. Or how we work to

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:46.942
ensure that. Can build the beds

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:50.846
that are needed as well as-

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:51.380
continue to train the work

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.482
force that's the- so there are

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:55.083
two parts to this question one

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:55.684
is on work force and one SR

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:59.221
crisis beds all take the crisis

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:04.126
that. In first- we as counties

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:07.896
are interested. Happy to see to

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:12.901
cal apply for a new. Unity

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:15.237
provided by the fed broke up.

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:16.939
And the Alef endemic. I receive

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:18.840
federal financial participation

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.976
so medic Medicaid funding of

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:24.746
federal funding for- stays in

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:25.347
what are considered in some

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:32.387
mental disease I am dis. These

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:34.990
are for mental health

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:35.624
facilities of more than sixteen

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:36.925
beds. Which means no state

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:39.294
money for individuals who have

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:42.831
to be in- oftentimes impatient

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:46.401
but also other settings for

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:52.407
their mental health trip. This.

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:59.014
Is which to be institution and

01:16:59.081 --> 01:16:59.681
put unity rather than have them.

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:01.316
Face being locked up for the

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:02.918
rest of their lives these are

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.886
really important tenants of our

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:07.556
community behavioral health

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:08.056
movement and we need to-

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:11.626
preserve them however. The big

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:15.163
sucking sound in cap behavioral

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:18.266
health budgets today are these

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:20.602
days that we're we're spending

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:21.236
our realignment dollar sign we

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.105
don't have a lot left over for

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:25.073
unity based services. When we

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:25.741
have. Full at that cute end of

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:26.341
the spectrum and it does tie

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:27.275
back to parity because when

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:29.177
individuals with private

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:29.745
commercial coverage are not

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:32.781
able to get the care they need-

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:35.050
and they fail in to the public

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:37.619
behavior health system- they

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:41.857
end up medic how beneficiaries

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:44.559
the B. and- beneficiaries of

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.561
the public behavior health

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:49.364
system. And it ends up costing

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:50.899
all of. Tivoli need to take

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:51.566
some time the federal waiver is

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:54.770
very carefully crafted it-

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:59.608
provides for a maximum of

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:02.210
thirty. Day length of stay in

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:02.878
these I. M. D. facilities so it

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:09.284
and require. I maintain the

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:15.424
current. Both based mental

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:16.024
health services in California

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:16.558
but demonstrate that were

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:18.860
actually in. Number. Very

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:19.461
balanced and cost wave needy

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:20.996
our counties are really eager.

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:21.630
And what what is we guarantee

01:18:21.696 --> 01:18:23.398
that we would take the new

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:24.900
money that we could bring into

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:27.469
our system with this waiver and

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.938
build out the community based

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:30.505
continuing because once we

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:36.278
create new capacity. In lower

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:39.247
levels levels of care we can

01:18:39.314 --> 01:18:43.385
step people down to assembly

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:44.853
member Frasier's and get people

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.989
moving on the cover not have

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:48.890
them be stuck at it it to show

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:51.593
up. Whether it's not he- you

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.194
have to do something to start

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:57.365
to fly to create better flow

01:18:57.432 --> 01:19:02.404
here. Every thing where.

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:05.073
Talking. About into terms of

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:05.674
community baby be health this

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.810
is. To be working how space.

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:09.311
Their top not one issue

01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:11.780
everybody's focus on it it's

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:15.450
really exciting but we will not

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:21.256
be able to do one tenth of the

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:21.857
things we aspire to do. It we

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:26.261
don't as a state. In

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:26.862
infrastructure. And that is.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:32.467
All das places. So even to it

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:33.001
did get the job done on

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:34.769
certification so that we can

01:19:34.836 --> 01:19:38.473
pull in federal dollars for our

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:41.209
medic help as well that's going

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:46.681
to be step one and help our

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.249
work force- step. Can help

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:51.987
forces we need a. Round gaps.

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:52.621
System we don't accept that for

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:53.221
any Kerr were. Especially for

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.123
behavioral health works we need

01:19:55.190 --> 01:20:00.529
to at all levels out it is a

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:03.131
state for who's needed where.

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:08.436
It see about that I'm so that's

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:10.972
another. Piece for yes MHS it

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:11.573
was being discreet work force

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.841
it gives region by region.

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.577
State your is if you're Shasta

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:19.414
and you're trying to recruit a

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:22.617
psychiatrist- Sierra county

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:24.386
told me they don't not only do

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:26.755
they not have a six in the

01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:29.891
county they don't have a stock

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:30.759
they don't have a one way try

01:20:30.825 --> 01:20:33.628
the psychiatrist wants to move

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:34.262
there it's really really tough

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.764
and you know. He's been try. Me

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:43.071
at. If I'm as a state about how

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:43.705
we're going to. You know ensure

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:49.411
access to people of the state

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:50.445
but that that's. Really also a

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:53.315
matter of your ship and we're

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:53.915
really excited as we like the

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:57.252
mention. And I'm trying to

01:20:57.319 --> 01:20:58.887
address those solutions and I

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:01.223
will bring it full circle if I

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:06.795
can because maritime Burke

01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:11.233
talked about the right to have.

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:11.866
Your shelter as you would wish.

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:14.669
And. Yet the array one of. My

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:16.771
very rarely say this about the

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:17.372
land. Initially with. Regards

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:21.109
to. This was that we- right to

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:21.710
housing as well we did in the

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:24.879
I. D. D. community. And I.

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:25.480
Sorry mayors are no no no no I

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:37.626
just. It's a key point. Well in

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:38.260
its it. We don't have autistic

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:42.097
kids out on. And yet we have

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:42.831
mentally. People who also.

01:21:42.897 --> 01:21:45.100
Comes out on the street and

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:45.600
there's a role for the

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:46.835
legislature to work towards.

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:50.071
Can I just respond. Okay your

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:50.705
point he make I. Hope I didn't

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:53.208
take it from you are you. Like

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:59.614
I say the identical thing. All

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:02.817
of the time illustrates what's

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:03.418
at stake here potentially with

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:05.186
MHSAA re. So I do I'm not in

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:09.824
New York city's. Form of a

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:10.425
right to shelter H. said to be

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:19.768
getting. Because they are

01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:22.437
having in class. The intense.

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:23.071
Case management services in an

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:25.473
effort to get people into

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:26.007
permanent housing in their

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:27.509
system and yet. The result

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:31.746
lawsuit some for many decades.

01:22:31.813 --> 01:22:33.148
In New York City 95% of the un

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:43.224
sheltered. 95% of the homeless

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.160
population sheltered and

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:47.195
indoors five out. During you at

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:49.331
a thousand B. to California as

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:51.333
well. And so what does it cost

01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:56.037
them to do a very in perfect

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:56.638
right to shelter we would want

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:57.872
to do it better. About one

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:59.974
point six billion dollars a

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:00.508
year to bring seventy five

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:10.485
thousand people indoors. Our.

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:12.954
Estimate California is that

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:13.521
there are ninety thousand on

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:16.991
shelter. Beat up. There one

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:18.893
point six billion to do it

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.461
right to say two point five

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:24.299
billion. You don't think we

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:25.166
could find two point five

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:29.671
billion dollars a year for.

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:30.238
Distinguished horses in this

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:36.878
state. B. A. L. this. In this

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:40.782
area yes the shame on all. If

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.651
MHSAA were focused in the way

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:47.222
that I described. Hey we didn't

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:50.258
hurt anybody because we will

01:23:50.325 --> 01:23:51.192
then the rebar with medi cal

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:58.400
managed care and. And a and D.

01:23:58.466 --> 01:23:58.933
we couldn't find the first

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.735
billion dollar. Both of that to

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:09.878
put. Estimated get houses.

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:10.478
People first and roof and then

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:11.012
to get them to help in the

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:14.949
services. All the men triple H.

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:20.522
jin other local. Couldn't get

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:21.055
to two point five million

01:24:21.122 --> 01:24:24.726
dollars and. Actually get close

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:25.260
to ninety thousand people

01:24:25.326 --> 01:24:26.895
indoors using the MHSAA. I

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:28.897
think we could and that's what.

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:33.067
This is becoming. An epidemic

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:37.505
crisis not only public health

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:38.072
and public it was becoming a

01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:43.344
political crisis. And why

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:45.480
shouldn't this acted.

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:56.324
Originally was intended. Going

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:56.891
to action okay or not all of

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:59.461
the money. One four billion.

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:00.061
Some of it already going down

01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:03.698
shelter. And then at. Cap six

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:04.966
hundred fifty million dollars

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:08.937
to maybe will come this this

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.104
next year of the budget is

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:12.474
still killing okay. And we

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:12.941
could put together the

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.943
resources action. Next is to

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:16.811
get that put that state. An

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:19.747
academic discussion about

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:21.249
wouldn't it be nice if we made

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:27.722
MHSAA more more outcome based.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:28.356
Be a real discussion here about

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:34.863
priorities as well. Thank you.

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:36.731
Are you sure your belief 1100%

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:45.340
What I see the is. We've got a

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:45.974
great study back for that did

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.075
you really. Sure was two point

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.910
two billion efficient. Sir you

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:53.081
care for the. In California two

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:53.615
point two billion dollars

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:58.319
deficient. Yeah we did nothing

01:25:58.386 --> 01:26:01.556
about it in the budget we

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:02.090
augmented for thirty five

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:04.926
million dollars but. The need

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:05.426
is two point two billion

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:12.600
dollars that is. My first visit

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:14.736
I've been elected official. For

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:18.740
seven years I've- I might thank

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:19.374
you me answers you guys are the

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.209
experts give me the he says my

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:23.244
frustration because that's a

01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:25.446
lot of money and we made

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:26.047
promises when we go out for a

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:33.087
ballot measure. Asking for help.

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:33.688
In the counties are paying for

01:26:33.755 --> 01:26:36.691
it stays open it. Bears

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:41.296
repeating for everything.

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.164
Everything's. Closed and they

01:26:43.231 --> 01:26:44.866
pay for everything proof. Hard

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:47.001
work but we won't. They have an

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:49.203
expectation that there's gonna

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.837
be a are you but what I'm just

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:52.941
not step. For me to this so

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:53.541
when you talk about housing I

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:54.042
was a general contractor

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:56.844
developer. When we talk about

01:26:56.911 --> 01:27:00.381
green in numbers and mandates.

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:03.818
Through municipality what the

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:11.426
required affordable of moderate

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:11.960
the acidic is there come.

01:27:12.026 --> 01:27:15.129
Should it. It has this it

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:16.764
additional housing component

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.967
requires municipalities to have

01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:21.836
a dramatic impact in this field

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:22.403
or they don't get their past

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:33.214
through. Number two. I'm not

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:33.781
seeing a lot of effort would

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:38.753
collaborate. At the counter if

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.922
on this I see. You know then

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:43.291
and I'm not trying to knock the

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:45.493
counties but I see some county

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:46.127
sitting on a large amount of

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:48.663
mesa money also that stagnates

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:49.263
that's not being utilized. My

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:55.670
county was one of them. Matter

01:27:55.737 --> 01:27:58.039
of fact it was three o'clock is

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:02.844
with mayor Steinberg lives of.

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:03.444
Them but I felt very strongly.

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:05.046
In some. Money party had made

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:11.452
to us. With the. That is that

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:12.053
creates that requirement from

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:21.562
for this better not mitigation

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:22.196
but trying to get a handle on

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:24.165
this housing own number but. So

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:24.766
components so if it's kind of

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:28.770
look. Happen because we think

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:31.072
was this in housing is optional

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:33.041
involuntary all optional we do

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:35.076
the best we can it's all bottom

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.879
up there is no legal

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:40.581
requirement that we bring that

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:43.418
provide a roof for everybody in

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:43.985
this state and it's over. A

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:47.422
public policy and then we. Our

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:52.827
resources. Yeah imperative.

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:54.962
It's going to continue to that

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:57.165
is not it's not the it's all of

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:57.765
us is not just the counties

01:28:57.832 --> 01:29:01.335
thank you for the county it's

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:04.372
the city's it's all of us meant

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:04.972
when I'm trying to say is I

01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:05.506
agree with you. Talk about

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:09.343
spreading Pena thought yeah. We

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:16.284
throw a lot of stuff. A little

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.918
amount of it a lot of stuff and

01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:18.986
get very small. You're right we

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:19.620
do need to prime eyes. Hard to

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:20.988
make it it's- just very little

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:25.193
games. On this question of

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:27.862
homelessness if I may chair- I

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:32.934
think it's important to note to

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.005
in a few cases of this. One is.

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:40.775
With all due respect to- mayor

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:43.177
Steinberg. Of I'm- our worry

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:45.113
center and- individuals who

01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:45.747
face under the plan to Max who

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:46.247
are among our homeless

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:49.283
population- we have an LA

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.884
county are homeless outreach

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:52.019
team who did a survey of the

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:53.821
nineteen most. Vulnerable

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:58.826
people living a good row five

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:00.928
of. The nineteen- regional

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:04.999
center client. So that to me

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:08.770
ask. To see if they can tear in

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.738
the net for people who have.

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:11.272
Phillips as well as mental

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:11.906
illness- I think that this is

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:13.141
in a really important issue

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:13.741
that we need to address and

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:15.009
unfortunately it does get

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:17.078
rolled up in the bigger issues

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:19.680
around homelessness. On

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:20.281
homelessness- this is another

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:25.586
area where I don't know that I

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:27.021
quibble. So much with the

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:30.992
solutions fairly we do need to.

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:31.526
Press the- illness. Is to

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:33.094
preserve. Countless people

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:33.628
living on the streets- I

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:36.030
definitely at I can tell you

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:39.433
and I can provide you with the

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.001
research and analysis that

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:44.772
backs this up- be. Issues are

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:46.841
not what's being our- crisis to.

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:49.243
It is one. Income inequality

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:51.345
and there being no place for

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:52.847
very low income people to live

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:54.949
and so if we want to get people

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:56.984
off of the streets quick we

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:59.320
need to provide them with

01:30:59.387 --> 01:30:59.921
subsidies we need to provide

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:02.290
them with affordable places to

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:05.693
live other wise as a

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.728
consequence of a failure to act

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:11.732
to. The low income people find

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.267
a place we're going to the

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:14.836
menu. Do you sing more.

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:17.071
Behavior health because my of

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:19.807
extended time living on

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:21.576
sheltered on the streets

01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:22.210
definitely will has and we have

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:27.014
an active we have. Back this up

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:32.086
it creates it it exacerbates it

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:37.558
worsens people health

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:38.893
conditions. So that. Not many

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:44.098
it act. Two police. Are people

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.933
going into homelessness that is

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.138
the import and we do not have a

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:53.207
farm. This conversation about

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:53.774
the other things that we're

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:56.711
finding. Prevent inter services

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:58.880
these three buckets because it

01:31:58.946 --> 01:32:01.315
is I'm not enough comfort for

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:03.150
us a two we definitely are not

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:04.952
looking at cal aim as a back

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:06.921
fill for what might be lost if

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:09.190
we shift these resources around

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:09.824
somewhere else so we do think

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:12.627
that there needs to be of a

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:13.261
fuller conversation about that

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:21.802
not to create more peanut

01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:22.403
butter at so that we can make

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:23.037
sure that core infrastructures

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:23.905
not. Austin to achieve very

01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:28.910
important other games. Seems

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:32.980
like a perfect. Thank you very

01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:36.751
much again I think it was great.

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:38.953
Thank you thank you thank you.

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:56.871
So we'll we're not

01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:18.993
. Panel as

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.862
his. Engine temperature in here

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:22.863
next go to Michelle Garber.

01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:25.366
Thank you and I hope you don't

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:25.967
get too tired of me by the end

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:29.637
of today. So the- panel was

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:31.372
presented with several

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:35.409
questions about of the 20% of

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:36.077
the mental health services fact

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:37.211
finding which goes to fund

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:38.980
prevention and early

01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:41.048
intervention. And one of the

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:43.150
questions was does California

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:45.286
need a larger in. Of prevention

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:49.924
and early intervention services

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:53.461
and- the end. Yes half of all

01:33:53.527 --> 01:33:57.098
counts. I am cases of diagnose.

01:33:57.164 --> 01:34:00.167
Mental illness begin by age

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:01.569
fourteen and three. Buy it for

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:04.005
us this alone points to the

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:06.874
fact the absolute bigger

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:08.943
investment and prevent.

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:09.543
Intervention the medical model

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.145
often compelled us towards a

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:13.080
feel our system of care where

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:13.714
an individual must read me a

01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:15.249
diagnosable state of sickness

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:17.251
before a treatment can be

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:18.986
delivered and our entire system

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:21.989
is oriented around trying to

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:23.758
reduce overall costs related to

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:25.359
that disease burden. Prevention

01:34:25.426 --> 01:34:28.963
it came she could be the point

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:30.831
but it's not currently

01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:31.332
California spending an

01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:33.968
estimated four hundred million

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:34.602
dollars on prevention and early

01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:35.836
intervention services through

01:34:35.903 --> 01:34:39.006
the MHSAA this is the crowning

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:40.941
that on it the jewel in our

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:42.643
crown. However I have to be

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:44.945
that this should not be a set

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:45.579
up where we're robbing Peter to

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:53.254
pay merry as that we have

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:53.888
outstanding significant debt to

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:57.491
both of them. Part of the

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:58.859
reason my cow port. Removing

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:00.995
the percentage like he ends

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:01.629
that are built into the act. If

01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:04.632
a cow. Improving the lives of

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:05.232
millions with serious mental

01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:09.703
illness was to invest save. 25%

01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.972
maybe thirty of its funding the

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:13.941
intervention or prevent it

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:19.547
would not be permitted to do

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:20.147
were essentially locked into a

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:23.117
model boxes up the pie. Purpose

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:25.086
of prevention and inter Andean

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:26.854
under the MHSAA to prevent

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:27.488
mental illness is from becoming

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:29.123
so disabling a proof time

untreated mental illness and

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:37.832
I'll just put a pin in that

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:41.268
because- you will see that here

01:35:41.335 --> 01:35:41.802
under prevention and early

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:43.237

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:45.339
already been built into the

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:47.208
fabric of the MHSAA and those

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:49.043
outcomes are homeless this

justice involved and prolong

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:59.253
suffering- these goals are also

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.988
put up along side. Groups of

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:03.424
reducing disparities- and

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.059
promoting recovery in other

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:07.094
goals there are certain things

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:07.728
that counties are required to

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:09.163
do your prevention early

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:11.031
intervention and certain things

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:13.934
that are optional so the

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:16.770
required bucket we are required

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:17.404
to fund to prevent activities

01:36:17.471 --> 01:36:20.875
except first. Counties we are

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:21.308
required to do early

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:23.410
intervention outreach for

illness and access and linkage.

01:36:34.955 --> 01:36:35.523
To be meant as well as stick my

01:36:35.589 --> 01:36:37.224
next. Optional are improved the

01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:39.293
act as for underserved

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.897
populations and believe it or

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:43.564
not suicide prevention counties

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:44.131
already have to determine-

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:45.566
mental health indicators that

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:46.200
are used to measure a reduction

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:48.068
to prolong Sir suffering and-

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:50.137
for any of the other six a

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:50.738
negative outcomes the program

01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:54.775
six. To affect. Also to make

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:56.911
our intended reductions of each

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:58.879
and then explain how were-

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:01.282
evaluating this so we do

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:04.919
actually do a lot right now

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.954
related to outcomes measurement

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:07.521
those sorts of things. But

01:37:07.588 --> 01:37:11.458
again it within the required

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:12.126
framework that we've been given

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:14.261
by our regulators so if there

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:17.898
are any assistance is it's that

01:37:17.965 --> 01:37:18.432
we haven't been. Existent

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:21.702
template or if those aren't the

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:22.336
right outcomes the ones that

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:25.906
we- I am a guy that we've been

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:26.874
given that men. Were also mixed

01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:29.343
a further refinement. In early

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:33.714
intervention fund. To SP one oh

01:37:33.781 --> 01:37:35.883
oh four of two thousand

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:36.450
eighteen which outlines the

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:42.556
following priorities for.

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:43.123
Mentioning the intervention

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:47.895
childhood trauma prevention.

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:49.663
And early intervention early

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:52.433
six and mood ordered. Reaching

01:37:52.499 --> 01:37:56.070
age meant a one at get a

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:57.705
student and I need you that was

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:59.974
college of programs and

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.610
culturally attend linguistic

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:03.444
programs and strategies to

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:06.780
target the mental health needs

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:09.683
of older adults and older

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:10.251
adults it's really important

01:38:10.317 --> 01:38:12.820
as- aging is actually associate

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:13.387
with a- higher likelihood of

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:15.022
and- almost. Be here health

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:20.494
directors. Not support the

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:21.128
state- limiting what we can do

01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:23.430
in terms of prevention and

01:38:23.497 --> 01:38:25.599
prevention up to just practice

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:26.133
toward what are considered

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.703
back. This is. The reason is

01:38:29.770 --> 01:38:30.838
that with a population is

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:33.440
versus California it's

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:33.941
imperative that we work

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:35.175
alongside individuals with

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:37.544
mental illness and our local

01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:40.047
communities to lift up. New

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:42.650
ideas new interventions and

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:45.519
ways of expressing already

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:46.086
tested best practices that

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:49.156
were- with these different

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:50.924
populations. These are our-

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:51.492
this isn't as we develop new

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:53.527
programs in new ways to. And we

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:55.796
build a new evidence that we've

01:38:55.863 --> 01:38:57.197
actually done this through the

01:38:57.264 --> 01:39:00.567
MHSAA if things are researched

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:02.136
and a value to it that's their

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:07.975
outcomes. Examples and this is

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:08.575
just sort of a list so to give

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:11.779
you a sense of evidence E. I.

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:12.346
models that we're currently

01:39:12.413 --> 01:39:15.516
fun- peer support. This is

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:16.183
going to talk more about up the

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:17.284
space shuttle from what we

01:39:17.351 --> 01:39:19.586
would have brought that to

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:21.288
California without the MH day-

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:25.793
early psychosis programs were

01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:26.427
currently developing bees in

01:39:26.493 --> 01:39:29.563
half of all counties- including

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:32.700
in Solano county where- like

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:33.467
hell but if. He's as well as

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:37.971
Kaiser commercial beneficiaries

01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:38.572
have been able to access those

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.674
services. Funding advance

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:41.241
directive for mental health

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:41.809
this is super important for

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.310
Jules who- may end up in the

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:45.279
crisis end of the continuum

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:47.715
because it allows them to

01:39:47.781 --> 01:39:49.016
express their desires for

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:51.251
treatment- and then in addition

01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:53.153
to this training. For it land

01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:55.222
as well as school force meant

01:39:55.289 --> 01:39:57.257
to help them de escalate and

01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:59.426
know how to engage with

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:00.060
individuals with serious mental

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:03.197
health art county behavioral

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:05.132
health directors. Very much

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:07.201
support movement in the

01:40:07.267 --> 01:40:09.169
direction of a more population

01:40:09.236 --> 01:40:10.871
based health model for

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:13.240
behavioral health delivery

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:13.874
where we can double down on

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:15.008
prevention and early

01:40:15.075 --> 01:40:17.010
intervention we believe that

01:40:17.077 --> 01:40:19.046
any movement to reshape the

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:21.515
MHSAA. Must recommit the state

01:40:21.582 --> 01:40:22.082
to these important goals and

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:23.917
draw from all the great work

01:40:23.984 --> 01:40:25.285
we've already done in this

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:28.088
space and again that gets back

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:29.490
to the hole. In our

01:40:29.556 --> 01:40:32.926
conversation we just had up to

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:36.163
focus the inmates say where to

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:39.900
put the attention you know the

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:40.501
one thing I did not. And the

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:41.402
list at. Out was put in check

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:44.004
and you know we have to look at

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:48.475
how are we as a system going to

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:50.978
prevent individuals from

01:40:51.044 --> 01:40:54.181
entering the public. Health

01:40:54.248 --> 01:40:54.815
system in the first place when.

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:57.317
Art by. Some kind right there's

01:40:57.384 --> 01:41:03.056
gotta be accounted. That end

01:41:03.123 --> 01:41:03.991
are the public safety net we're

01:41:04.057 --> 01:41:09.396
there right now to help catch

01:41:09.463 --> 01:41:12.299
people. When they fall but to

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:12.866
many people falling into our

01:41:12.933 --> 01:41:20.574
system. I would argue at he

01:41:20.641 --> 01:41:21.208
says that. Sing societal part

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:25.245
things like hold off. Problems

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:27.781
the engines out some the case

01:41:27.848 --> 01:41:28.916
of homelessness can argue that.

01:41:28.982 --> 01:41:31.985
Our do it in this way to say to

01:41:32.052 --> 01:41:32.619
prevent our clients from tree

01:41:32.686 --> 01:41:33.253
homelessness in the first place

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:35.823
we can't prevent- the volumes

01:41:35.889 --> 01:41:39.626
of people they're going coming

01:41:39.693 --> 01:41:45.732
into. Today writ large and so

01:41:45.799 --> 01:41:47.367
the. The chain and the strategy

01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:49.369
to address that on a statewide

01:41:49.436 --> 01:41:50.704
basis must be much. Bigger the

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.407
we would argue is for all our

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:54.842
systems to do better- we need

01:41:54.908 --> 01:41:57.678
to go beyond our basic parity

01:41:57.744 --> 01:41:58.278
requirements and go the extra

01:41:58.345 --> 01:41:58.979
mile to acknowledge the need

01:41:59.046 --> 01:42:01.748
for improved access and bill.

01:42:01.815 --> 01:42:02.349
Put up police say because this

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:09.823
pro. In the commercial. System

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:12.893
as well as public system we

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:13.494
need to start to take serious

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.195
mental illness. Crisis will be

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:19.399
one- not solely with an HSA

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:23.270
reform thank you. Next we

01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:33.380
apparently on mir. But it's

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:34.948
good afternoon. My ex afternoon

01:42:35.015 --> 01:42:35.549
inter person around the life

01:42:35.616 --> 01:42:43.190
members of the assembly budget

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:43.824
subcommittee I'd like to thank

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:48.495
you for this opportunity.

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:53.200
Discount to depart. I'm almost

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:54.768
person who has been empty purse.

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:59.106
Anyway sorry but it is blessed

01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:01.542
it is my history so- when MHSAA

01:43:01.608 --> 01:43:02.175
was just about what initiative

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:05.746
with prop sixty three- and as

01:43:05.812 --> 01:43:06.280
nami affiliate member and

01:43:06.346 --> 01:43:10.617
eventually I nami California

01:43:10.684 --> 01:43:14.588
board member. I advocated for

01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:15.055
that passage of this

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:16.857
proposition hello with so many.

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:24.731
Date pass the- have watched and

01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:25.299
contributed and impacted by

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:25.866
prop the- its maturation as

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:28.569
MHSAA. During this time at the

01:43:28.635 --> 01:43:31.605
very beginning actually. On. I

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:34.741
have I was on. Because of M.

01:43:34.808 --> 01:43:35.342
HSA funding I was eventually

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:37.144
employed to run a large peer

01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:40.881
run organization in Los Angeles

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:41.548
county call project return peer

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:48.121
support network. Which has a

01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:51.058
nearly 90% MHSAA find it. It's

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:58.732
very our pure organizations

01:43:58.799 --> 01:43:59.366
around that date- primarily it

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:00.834
just say find it I was. The

01:44:00.901 --> 01:44:03.136
MHSAA find dead stigma

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:03.737
reduction- each mine map first

01:44:03.804 --> 01:44:07.174
the first PP mantra. People

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:07.808
would say well wait are you and

01:44:07.874 --> 01:44:11.511
that and then they would tell

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:12.145
me about their cousin or their

01:44:12.212 --> 01:44:18.218
sister or themselves live with

01:44:18.285 --> 01:44:18.852
a mental health condition and-

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:19.486
I could get help I am. Nine I'm

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:20.787
not. After spending four years

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:24.925
working for the federal

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:25.559
government the director of the

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:26.159
office of consumer affairs the

01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:26.660
thought he said. This is

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:29.796
minutes. Work for the county of

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:35.002
LA. Like dancing. Up without

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:37.104
the MHSAA funded in the program

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:43.143
was to take. So I'm. You would

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:45.145
a not just a year and a

01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:47.214
consumer but I. T. E. R. I am

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.049
the evidence that MHSAA

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:49.583
programs can achieve their

01:44:49.650 --> 01:44:50.951
intended outcomes especially

01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:51.518
for those like me who been

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:53.920
diagnosed with that

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:54.488
schizophrenia I'm a suicide

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:57.457
attempt survivor and have.

01:44:57.524 --> 01:45:05.265
Experienced homelessness. Even

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:05.799
though we're talking a lot

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:06.433
about numbers and die. I think

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:09.036
it import. It you have this

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:10.904
kind of yes in this time. I

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:13.273
believe that no one would want

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:13.907
to be my friend- that I was not

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:15.275
worthy of help and worse that I

01:45:15.342 --> 01:45:17.144
was not worthy of love I did

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.879
not even believe that my

01:45:18.945 --> 01:45:19.513
struggles were due to having a

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:24.885
mental health condition. I

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:25.552
rejected any form of help and I

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:29.556
also. Rejected the people who

01:45:29.623 --> 01:45:30.157
loved me and supported me the

01:45:30.223 --> 01:45:32.025
most and that's my- only. It

01:45:32.092 --> 01:45:36.596
specially appear. Like me as-

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:37.130
an American woman. Having

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:40.634
access to support in ways. And

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:41.234
it was like dipping my toe in

01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:42.736
the water and giving it a try

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:47.240
it is. First described. Help

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:48.909
them giving them this

01:45:48.975 --> 01:45:50.844
opportunity to just try it out

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:51.411
our MHSAA programs touch the

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:53.413
lives of so many for those in

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.551
most need- people at risk of

01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:58.151
homelessness as an example are

01:45:58.218 --> 01:46:05.592
outcome from appear respite.

01:46:05.659 --> 01:46:06.193
Shows peers are successful in

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:11.498
people that shelter in house.

01:46:11.565 --> 01:46:12.032
Your respite the voluntary

01:46:12.099 --> 01:46:13.667
short when I. Right community

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:22.075
based. Crisis port to help find.

01:46:22.142 --> 01:46:30.884
And it's. Transformation grant.

01:46:30.951 --> 01:46:31.384
Grant ran out they were

01:46:31.451 --> 01:46:34.921
continuing with and just fun. A

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:36.990
lot less county adopted dot

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:38.959

pressure centerless county

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:41.595
again. Turn off. And then

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:47.901
because of its. Shifted to arm

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:52.239
a CSS funding- and then

01:46:52.305 --> 01:46:52.739
currently there's a new

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:53.306
restaurant opening on me to

01:46:53.373 --> 01:46:54.875
county which will also be I am

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:57.377
to say dollars. Would it lead

01:46:57.444 --> 01:46:58.011
need more pure rest across the

01:46:58.078 --> 01:46:58.545
state to reach and support

01:46:58.612 --> 01:47:01.348
people. And connection to

01:47:01.414 --> 01:47:04.284
treatment and supports people

01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:04.851
with very high complex needs

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:08.622
living with Smith says and co

01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:09.122
occurring substance use

01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:11.291
disorders need to know your

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:13.193
approach and people meet where

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:17.297
they are to. Better. They're

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:17.831
trained in evidence based

01:47:17.898 --> 01:47:20.600
practices such as seeking

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:21.234
safety Wallace recovery action

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.803
plan intentional Pierson. And

01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:25.005
professional interviewing and

01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:25.605
with the addition of sharing

01:47:25.672 --> 01:47:27.040
their personal story of

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:29.009
recovery with interest support.

01:47:29.075 --> 01:47:33.079
We see- and evidence has shown

01:47:33.146 --> 01:47:33.547
that people move from

01:47:33.613 --> 01:47:36.483
homelessness to being house.

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:38.151
Unemployed or on disability to

01:47:38.218 --> 01:47:38.718
employ and from the least to

01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:44.157
show. Your support is also

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:44.624
proven to help people

01:47:44.691 --> 01:47:45.225
participate in and it here to

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:51.264
try and. Family members to feel

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:55.168
confident believe. We were

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:55.802
really hoping this year with SB

01:47:55.869 --> 01:47:56.336
ten that well we know what

01:47:56.403 --> 01:48:02.843
happened. You know what

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:03.410
happened a little. While but

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:08.181
what we're really hoping is

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:08.715
that we can join the other

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:09.216
forty eight states. To

01:48:09.282 --> 01:48:13.386
certificates. Working on site

01:48:13.453 --> 01:48:18.525
provide to address. With your

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:19.092
mental health condition our

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:19.559
current substance use

01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:23.029
conditions. An HSA funding is

01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:26.433
needed now more than ever to

01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:32.138
ensure that we have. Robot

01:48:32.205 --> 01:48:32.606
array of recovery and

01:48:32.672 --> 01:48:35.775
resilience evidence. This. That

01:48:35.842 --> 01:48:36.376
are based on evidence does in

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:44.217
the most need. Those outcomes

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:44.818
live it to the people who are

01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:48.088
being served sometimes I think

01:48:48.154 --> 01:48:48.622
thinking about things very

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:49.189
traditionally. The tree. To

01:48:49.256 --> 01:48:52.893
medication. Being in a hospital

01:48:52.959 --> 01:48:56.229
when in fact some of the things

01:48:56.296 --> 01:48:56.763
we're thinking about that

01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:59.766
Medicaid mean find certain P.

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:00.367
no just having a friend being

01:49:00.433 --> 01:49:03.503
able to hang out with some able

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:06.907
to. Connect with a with a lot.

01:49:06.973 --> 01:49:09.542
How to do that I'm we- want to

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:10.143
make sure that those outcomes

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:11.678
are important to us as well

01:49:11.745 --> 01:49:13.380
when funding has arbitrate

01:49:13.446 --> 01:49:16.283
limits that do not support

01:49:16.349 --> 01:49:16.850
counties to address plaques

01:49:16.917 --> 01:49:18.051
needs I worry that we can never

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:20.353
be able to address- the needs

01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:22.522
of those who are. More than

01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:25.892
house houses the physical

01:49:25.959 --> 01:49:30.697
structure we actually don't

01:49:30.764 --> 01:49:35.302
pull a community meeting and I

01:49:35.368 --> 01:49:39.139
cystic here the ports recovery.

01:49:39.205 --> 01:49:42.776
Only at. The need. We need this

01:49:42.842 --> 01:49:47.013
and we deserve better. Of the

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:47.580
street that folks are home.

01:49:47.647 --> 01:49:53.019
They're looking for is love and

01:49:53.086 --> 01:49:53.653
people not math or other things

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:54.287
that are real interest for them

01:49:54.354 --> 01:49:55.021
to really look. Next shipping

01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:56.957
out there and connected. This

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:58.992
can do in the community. So I

01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:01.294
telling you my- pretty now the

01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:01.962
only thing I can stress is that

01:50:02.028 --> 01:50:03.830
this is not really about

01:50:03.897 --> 01:50:07.133
statistics as I said I am not a

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:07.734
statistic my peers are not a

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:09.235
statistic our family or not

01:50:09.302 --> 01:50:15.075
statistics this is about people

01:50:15.141 --> 01:50:17.177
and unfortunately. Com. So I

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:19.212
wish we could have a very

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:19.779
simple answer but they're-

01:50:19.846 --> 01:50:20.747
never usually a simple answer

01:50:20.814 --> 01:50:23.984
to. We need something to drink

01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:25.685
that allow it relentlessly go

01:50:25.752 --> 01:50:26.286
after practices practitioners

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:30.323
peers and program that can help

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.957
those who most need to thrive

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:35.228
and for community to thrive as

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:41.668
well. And I know it can be and

01:50:41.735 --> 01:50:42.369
I'm here. Today because

01:50:42.435 --> 01:50:45.138
evidence that it can be done

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:48.975
and I'm not the only. I might.

01:50:49.042 --> 01:50:51.077
Leader leaders as well so free

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:54.581
is not easy. To say funding to

01:50:54.647 --> 01:50:55.148
help us move forward in our

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:57.717
recovery thank you. Thank you

01:50:57.784 --> 01:50:59.219
miss merry and- before we go on

01:50:59.285 --> 01:50:59.853
the Toby Ewing I just wanted to

01:50:59.919 --> 01:51:05.492
say that. Important peer

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:07.127
support is. Not been advocating

01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:07.761
because I sought success within

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:08.895
the emergency department. It

01:51:08.962 --> 01:51:14.701
was this year. Order through SP

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:15.301
ten and how we can go forward

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:17.771
with that piece of legislation.

01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:22.609
But if my office can be helpful

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:23.209
at all I'd like to be able to

01:51:23.276 --> 01:51:26.413
with you and anyone. Else who's

01:51:26.479 --> 01:51:26.980
interested in that. Next we

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:30.850
have to be. Definite to chair.

01:51:30.917 --> 01:51:31.351
Mister Mister amulet the

01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:34.954
stripper staff. I've sat in

01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:37.357
this room with you are in the

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:37.991
other room actually many times

01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:38.525
and so I appreciate your

01:51:38.591 --> 01:51:44.030
persistence on this issue you

01:51:44.097 --> 01:51:47.834
know I was able as hall. For

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:50.403
the. Panel this conversation

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:53.073
aren't new there are. Okay you

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:56.509
taking time some of the files

01:51:56.576 --> 01:51:59.112
and. I heard a lot of hobby

01:51:59.179 --> 01:52:01.881
brief just because of the time

01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:05.218
and I certainly will get. It's

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:05.852
funny to call the E. which may

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:08.721
have- there's a couple of

01:52:08.788 --> 01:52:09.322
things that I just wanted to

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:09.923
highlight. That the it is the

01:52:09.989 --> 01:52:12.192
P. to say that really sets it

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:20.166
up. If you go back to that.

01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:20.767
California struck our mental

01:52:20.834 --> 01:52:21.401
health system before today yeah

01:52:21.468 --> 01:52:26.940
who was no strategy to engage

01:52:27.006 --> 01:52:28.942
early our system rationed

01:52:29.008 --> 01:52:30.944
access based on the severity of

01:52:31.010 --> 01:52:32.712
an illness and so family

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:34.814
members and community members

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:35.415
consumers came to the little

01:52:35.482 --> 01:52:36.883
Hoover commission at the time

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:39.319
and said that many people were

01:52:39.385 --> 01:52:39.953
turned away because the illness

01:52:40.019 --> 01:52:42.722
was not sufficiently severe

01:52:42.789 --> 01:52:47.160
than to qualify for care so the

01:52:47.227 --> 01:52:48.761
P. I. component. Of the M. HSA.

01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:49.362
Is this elegant vision pace

01:52:49.429 --> 01:52:55.702
that recognizes that we can't

01:52:55.768 --> 01:52:56.336
afford to treat our way out of

01:52:56.402 --> 01:53:02.408
the challenges that we faced in

01:53:02.475 --> 01:53:02.909
California whether it's

01:53:02.976 --> 01:53:03.409
homelessness or criminal

01:53:03.476 --> 01:53:05.078
justice involvement. Tell off

01:53:05.145 --> 01:53:11.217
of me so many of the. In terms

01:53:11.284 --> 01:53:11.818
of the seven negative outcomes

01:53:11.885 --> 01:53:14.888
the thunder PI- PI also was

01:53:14.954 --> 01:53:15.355
monumental and that is

01:53:15.421 --> 01:53:17.357
identified that brought a ray

01:53:17.423 --> 01:53:17.957
of outcomes and if you look at

01:53:18.024 --> 01:53:25.131
the- up to the merging or. Or

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:30.537
global definitions of well

01:53:30.603 --> 01:53:31.137
being put forth by the United

01:53:31.204 --> 01:53:31.638
Nations or the position

01:53:31.704 --> 01:53:32.138
tracking among operation

01:53:32.205 --> 01:53:39.979
develop. A line very closely.

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:40.580
To the notion that people may

01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:45.318
perform. An employee being in

01:53:45.385 --> 01:53:47.120
one with that. Health safe and

01:53:47.187 --> 01:53:50.890
avoiding service seventh. So P.

01:53:50.957 --> 01:53:51.558
I. is groundbreaking because it

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:53.226
says that we need to invest in

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:53.826
strategies that are upstream

01:53:53.893 --> 01:53:55.094
that engage people very early

01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:57.163
and very cost effective ways

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:59.232
and do so beyond the

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:00.867
traditional clinical modalities

01:54:00.934 --> 01:54:03.303
of what we might think of this

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:05.939
as mental health and the

01:54:06.005 --> 01:54:07.173
language I think torque it was

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:10.276
a little shocking to our mental

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:10.910
health system because it called

01:54:10.977 --> 01:54:12.111
upon the system. Is that it had

01:54:12.178 --> 01:54:19.953
not in the past in in that ten.

01:54:20.019 --> 01:54:20.587
Time Sistine over the. Issue is

01:54:20.653 --> 01:54:23.189
around how many span. Or over

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:23.723
the purview of behavioral

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:24.857
health directors. May not. The

01:54:24.924 --> 01:54:27.760
tool women for example or to

01:54:27.827 --> 01:54:29.829
address housing rights and

01:54:29.896 --> 01:54:35.835
that's very real. One of the

01:54:35.902 --> 01:54:38.671
one of the ways in which. This

01:54:38.738 --> 01:54:39.272
tension at least that to the

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:46.613
commission that we see it. Is

01:54:46.679 --> 01:54:47.180
up there as pot. Purses the

01:54:47.247 --> 01:54:48.014
image there is a revenue stream.

01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:49.182
I think it's very clear the-

01:54:49.249 --> 01:54:54.254
well and it. Today a and

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:54.821
heading even with said more

01:54:54.887 --> 01:55:00.593
than. Rating are insufficient

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:01.194
if we're going to think about

01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:01.861
prevention in. Terms of all of

01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:06.399
those things and so we don't we

01:55:06.466 --> 01:55:08.868
don't think that way listening.

01:55:08.935 --> 01:55:09.435
To have what we think about

01:55:09.502 --> 01:55:13.172
this. The mission really design

01:55:13.239 --> 01:55:15.074
systems that will support

01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:15.708
prevention that touch upon all

01:55:15.775 --> 01:55:18.411
of those issues not just

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:22.682
through the delivery of mental

01:55:22.749 --> 01:55:25.285
health. Services and responses

01:55:25.351 --> 01:55:28.855
and not even just through

01:55:28.921 --> 01:55:30.890
public sector. Dollars but the

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:33.192
cop and today was around the

01:55:33.259 --> 01:55:34.794
commercial side okay. But if.

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:39.132
And at full or reducing child

01:55:39.198 --> 01:55:39.599
deaths so many of the

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:40.199
interventions that the state

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:41.034
has been promoting have nothing

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:41.567
to do with spent a public

01:55:41.634 --> 01:55:43.069
dollar and they have to do with

01:55:43.136 --> 01:55:44.737
education and awareness and

01:55:44.804 --> 01:55:47.974
changing behavior you know

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:48.541
raise your hand if when you

01:55:48.608 --> 01:55:53.746
were a kid to put suntan lotion

01:55:53.813 --> 01:55:54.914
on. And raise your hand if

01:55:54.981 --> 01:55:57.250
you're not doing that today

01:55:57.317 --> 01:55:57.850
because we learned a lot about

01:55:57.917 --> 01:55:59.452
what it means to provide. It

01:55:59.519 --> 01:56:01.354
prevention is really leverage

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:02.889
not just the financial

01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:06.592
resources that the state has

01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:07.193
made available through I just

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:09.262
say or to the other phone at

01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:15.268
end up to support our county

01:56:15.335 --> 01:56:15.835
driven public mental health

01:56:15.902 --> 01:56:20.340
system so a I heard a lot about

01:56:20.406 --> 01:56:20.940
the various components to the

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:24.911
M. HSA. In about some of the

01:56:24.977 --> 01:56:28.081
pertinent that were there

01:56:28.147 --> 01:56:30.783
they're in every county there

01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:32.752
is one or more bands that are

01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:36.989
fundamental key care- ticket

01:56:37.056 --> 01:56:37.590
we've he of her and today we

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:38.091
can highlight more- the

01:56:38.157 --> 01:56:39.192
commission has really been

01:56:39.258 --> 01:56:40.960
working to identify a handful

01:56:41.027 --> 01:56:42.895
of those programs that are cost

01:56:42.962 --> 01:56:44.931
effective and begin to roll

01:56:44.997 --> 01:56:45.465
those out as a statewide

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:47.633
strategy not necessarily in

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.302
every county early psychosis

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:51.504
programs the best example that

01:56:51.571 --> 01:56:55.842
we have with support from the

01:56:55.908 --> 01:56:58.578
legislature- with support and

01:56:58.644 --> 01:57:00.613
partnering with. UC system and

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:07.120
the money's. If seven. As was

01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:07.754
mentioned it's partnering with

01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:08.254
us to try to build out a

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:10.923
statewide system of or the-

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.792
Roach- in partnership with our

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:13.292
universities and it's a

01:57:13.359 --> 01:57:15.061
learning piece to that. Head

01:57:15.128 --> 01:57:16.896
space came up with to call all

01:57:16.963 --> 01:57:19.165
co here- the school mental

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:21.200
health work suicide prevention

01:57:21.267 --> 01:57:21.768
work the commission recently

01:57:21.834 --> 01:57:25.938
adopted the state. Suicide

01:57:26.005 --> 01:57:29.842
prevention plan it should be

01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:30.443
released publicly in the next

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:31.043
couple of weeks. This is late

01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:40.853
and push it out. Hello. Hey is

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.855
in part of these discussions we

01:57:42.922 --> 01:57:46.526
get asked quite a lot. I the

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:47.160
check in this is related to the

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:50.663
quick we are finding SP ten oh

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:51.197
four. SP ten of four has a

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:52.598
couple of. One is to direct

01:57:52.665 --> 01:57:53.132
them to give the counties

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:56.869
directing that to priority. P.

01:57:56.936 --> 01:57:59.005
I've thanks ten for the

01:57:59.071 --> 01:57:59.572
programs to the extent that.

01:57:59.639 --> 01:58:00.973
Come with us they are counties

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:01.541
the option of deviating from

01:58:01.607 --> 01:58:05.244
that list. It also asked the

01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:07.079
commission to establish a

01:58:07.146 --> 01:58:08.915
framework for evaluating PI.

01:58:08.981 --> 01:58:10.850
Part of the challenge we have

01:58:10.917 --> 01:58:12.785
is that if he recognized our

01:58:12.852 --> 01:58:15.021
our traditional primary

01:58:15.087 --> 01:58:17.857
secondary and tertiary

01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:18.691
prevention modalities borrowing

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:21.027
from the public health model

01:58:21.093 --> 01:58:21.594
and you apply that to the

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:27.300
broader. Issues that P. E.

01:58:27.366 --> 01:58:27.733
identifies from from

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:28.901
homelessness and involved. How

01:58:28.968 --> 01:58:30.903
long suffering it's very

01:58:30.970 --> 01:58:32.805
difficult to say how do we

01:58:32.872 --> 01:58:34.974
value wait a strategy when IT

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:36.909
such with this such a broad

01:58:36.976 --> 01:58:41.147
array of intersections between

01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:41.747
primary secondary tertiary and

01:58:41.814 --> 01:58:45.918
these domains. Where the

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:46.486
commission is today is we've

01:58:46.552 --> 01:58:50.056
night. California I think that

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:56.295
Max shared understand what

01:58:56.362 --> 01:58:56.863
prevents. The mental health

01:58:56.929 --> 01:58:58.865
space. Between the at sign. An

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:05.338
HSA riding if we take. Work the.

01:59:05.404 --> 01:59:08.307
Issues that are touched upon

01:59:08.374 --> 01:59:08.908
and then and then look at them

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:11.644
through that primary. A lot.

01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:12.211
The process of engaging the

01:59:12.278 --> 01:59:12.912
World Health Organization ten

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:14.780
yeah National Academy of

01:59:14.847 --> 01:59:15.414
sciences and others to begin at

01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:19.252
this question. Can't how can we

01:59:19.318 --> 01:59:20.853
begin to create a shared

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:21.420
framework for understanding

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:22.989
what prevention means and

01:59:23.055 --> 01:59:24.891
mental health. Through which we

01:59:24.957 --> 01:59:31.163
can begin to identify.

01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:31.797
Principles for making decisions

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:32.498
about how to prioritize. The

01:59:32.565 --> 01:59:33.065
much broader town. That had

01:59:33.132 --> 01:59:37.336
deployed. Since he I'm a county

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:39.138
I think there are based on the

01:59:39.205 --> 01:59:40.940
work done with the county is

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:41.607
the conversation that we've had

01:59:41.674 --> 01:59:42.909
with our research experts and

01:59:42.975 --> 01:59:45.077
other partners there are some

01:59:45.144 --> 01:59:47.179
things that that we could that

01:59:47.246 --> 01:59:49.749
California could do that you

01:59:49.815 --> 01:59:50.316
could do to strengthen the

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:51.083
strategy around funding

01:59:51.150 --> 01:59:55.721
allocations- for example we've

01:59:55.788 --> 01:59:56.289
counties that have been they

01:59:56.355 --> 01:59:58.758
have been required to return

01:59:58.824 --> 02:00:09.869
CSS fun. Because they felt like.

02:00:09.936 --> 02:00:10.503
101% all. Available need on the

02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:13.005
tools that they are. They'd

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:13.606
like to shift the I. but they

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:17.109
can't. Actually which are there

02:00:17.176 --> 02:00:18.945
are no more unmet needs that

02:00:19.011 --> 02:00:21.147
those domains for disturbing

02:00:21.213 --> 02:00:23.182
disturbing these dollars get

02:00:23.249 --> 02:00:26.018
set aside and the legislature

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:27.253
can re imagine what that

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.188
distribution looks like that

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:29.755
language was envisioned for

02:00:29.822 --> 02:00:36.963
estate why prop. Right and that

02:00:37.029 --> 02:00:37.530
when all needs are met each

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:38.898
county can that that. An

02:00:38.965 --> 02:00:40.900
example I guess it was a-

02:00:40.967 --> 02:00:42.935
research indicates they serve

02:00:43.002 --> 02:00:45.271
everybody who's eligible for

02:00:45.338 --> 02:00:49.208
CSS dollars but they can't

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:49.742
actually reallocate those

02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:51.143
dollars Intel LA and San Diego

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:54.947
in Orange County and everybody

02:00:55.014 --> 02:00:55.548
else is in the same spot so

02:00:55.615 --> 02:01:00.953
there are some opportunities we

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:01.554
think that that could lead to

02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:06.993
some. The case CSS that- set

02:01:07.059 --> 02:01:09.362
aside for F. S. P. actually has

02:01:09.428 --> 02:01:11.097
been met. But but short of that

02:01:11.163 --> 02:01:18.237
it's very early for us in in

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:18.838
all the literature that we've

02:01:18.904 --> 02:01:19.372
had in all the effort that

02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:20.973
we've talked about. Think about.

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:21.540
How to pick what's the best

02:01:21.607 --> 02:01:24.844
cost of that prevent. Find

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:26.946
Sierra orange in LA with that

02:01:27.013 --> 02:01:29.015
I'd I'd be happy to respond any

02:01:29.081 --> 02:01:29.649
questions you might have and I

02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:30.883
want to thank you again for the

02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:33.152
opportunity thank you Tony and-

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:36.689
next we have Kelly Pfeiffer and

02:01:36.756 --> 02:01:37.289
will return for questions at

02:01:37.356 --> 02:01:42.061
the end of the path okay better

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:42.662
employment staff thank you so

02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:50.202
much it's a- honor to be here.

02:01:50.269 --> 02:01:50.670
Any moment in time in

02:01:50.736 --> 02:01:51.270
California. Racial opportunity

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:58.978
to change. Because the moment

02:01:59.045 --> 02:01:59.545
like this where the governor

02:01:59.612 --> 02:02:00.112
the administration. See the

02:02:00.179 --> 02:02:01.380
latest. Of. We have this unique

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:04.250
moment in time with the medical

02:02:04.316 --> 02:02:04.917
waiver for men. Thank as saying

02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:05.551
you know what can we do about

02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:06.485
this particular waiver the

02:02:06.552 --> 02:02:07.053
other saying what is the

02:02:07.119 --> 02:02:08.988
Medicare program in the future

02:02:09.055 --> 02:02:09.488
look like and what would

02:02:09.555 --> 02:02:12.958
America from look. Really

02:02:13.025 --> 02:02:13.592
delivered on behavioral health

02:02:13.659 --> 02:02:14.994
outcomes and overall care

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:17.096
outcomes and that's what my

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:17.697
colleague Brenda I'm really

02:02:17.763 --> 02:02:19.098
should be talking about. And

02:02:19.165 --> 02:02:22.368
also on this this MHSAA as much

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:26.972
as we focus on a visit aren't

02:02:27.039 --> 02:02:27.540
working having practiced in

02:02:27.606 --> 02:02:30.676
other states it's incredible.

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:37.650
To sing in a to. Work in a

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:38.884
state where. These services can

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:42.455
be. Either way. Friends are we

02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:46.358
bring in. Your may I brief

02:02:46.425 --> 02:02:48.294
testimony some. Ready about. He

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:53.466
agreed with mers I can set some

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.134
all star. These are the we're

02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:56.969
going to see a different center.

02:02:57.036 --> 02:02:58.871
Loves to read we'll help

02:02:58.938 --> 02:02:59.472
business to making sure we're

02:02:59.538 --> 02:03:00.773
not putting our people with

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.775
mental illness and substance

02:03:02.842 --> 02:03:03.309
use disorder instructional

02:03:03.375 --> 02:03:05.845
justice system and really take

02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:06.746
care of our high risk kids and

02:03:06.812 --> 02:03:14.019
what's interesting about PI- in

02:03:14.086 --> 02:03:14.620
particular damage as well as

02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:18.324
you can really see. Townies. In

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:20.926
this work we do have is state

02:03:20.993 --> 02:03:21.560
what I'd metrics and being able

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:24.897
to quantitatively to distort.

02:03:24.964 --> 02:03:25.498
Robust evaluations and you'll

02:03:25.564 --> 02:03:27.867
see some real impressive

02:03:27.933 --> 02:03:28.934
results but we can't yet tell

02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:31.170
that story at the statewide

02:03:31.237 --> 02:03:36.776
level of my department's

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:37.877
committed to that. And. The

02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:40.913
third team- it just about

02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:43.149
making sure as we face the work

02:03:43.215 --> 02:03:43.749
we do rate what works. Reflect

02:03:43.816 --> 02:03:45.084
in a couple a few ways that an

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:46.952
HSA NPI has its frame now is

02:03:47.019 --> 02:03:51.857
making an impact on. These

02:03:51.924 --> 02:03:52.525
populations Amir stammer talked

02:03:52.591 --> 02:03:56.595
about- you know first in terms

02:03:56.662 --> 02:04:00.299
of criminal justice a- full

02:04:00.366 --> 02:04:04.837
service part. There's a bit of

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:06.772
us to evaluation Toby against

02:04:06.839 --> 02:04:07.406
did was. As in people and they

02:04:07.473 --> 02:04:09.175
have. A full service

02:04:09.241 --> 02:04:09.809
partnerships and I'm people but

02:04:09.875 --> 02:04:10.409
it's been a program had half

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:11.277
the arrest afterwards as they

02:04:11.343 --> 02:04:13.179
did before and if you look at

02:04:13.245 --> 02:04:16.248
the subpopulation with frequent

02:04:16.315 --> 02:04:16.882
arrest those of that restaurant

02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:19.652
we went down by two thirds. And

02:04:19.718 --> 02:04:20.252
those who are homeless arrest

02:04:20.319 --> 02:04:25.257
weightless I have no we do have

02:04:25.324 --> 02:04:27.827
a statewide. Story to tell

02:04:27.893 --> 02:04:28.928
about service partnerships I

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:31.096
think is important remember.

02:04:31.163 --> 02:04:34.900
And then what P. of corpses in.

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:35.434
Where is says within the

02:04:35.501 --> 02:04:36.001
program cannot reduce income

02:04:36.068 --> 02:04:37.203
and equities and housing costs

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:39.205
but we can intervene at that

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:41.373
critical moment in time before

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.775
someone loses their housing.

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:45.010
And prevent them from ending up

02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:45.644
in the criminal justice system

02:04:45.711 --> 02:04:51.884
are of with homelessness. And

02:04:51.951 --> 02:04:52.351
then there's the other

02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:55.554
population of high risk kids

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:56.121
many of the programs you'll

02:04:56.188 --> 02:05:05.397
see. Five into the- hi only a

02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:06.031
few days with diction and make

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:06.665
sure that that doesn't. Happen

02:05:06.732 --> 02:05:09.168
county welfare program because

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:10.769
no outcome is better by foster

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:11.370
care so as we can king family

02:05:11.437 --> 02:05:14.240
there. Again okay- we change it

02:05:14.306 --> 02:05:17.610
to say let's protect what works

02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:18.244
I'm a just a few questions on

02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:21.180
my own departments- work around

02:05:21.247 --> 02:05:21.780
Pete as you know the work how

02:05:21.847 --> 02:05:23.182
old. Work with news we do

02:05:23.249 --> 02:05:24.884
fiscal oversight making sure

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:26.886
that the spending the county

02:05:26.952 --> 02:05:27.486
matches the three year plan

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:29.054
that their- is. To have the

02:05:29.121 --> 02:05:31.190
prudent reserves to make sure

02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:32.892
that as we have recessions that

02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:33.425
were able to continue the

02:05:33.492 --> 02:05:36.929
programming and we do program

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:39.131
oversight as well including on

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:45.337
site reviews- working with to

02:05:45.404 --> 02:05:49.975
make each come. MHM. Is done

02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:50.509
well and if they need for

02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:51.143
corrective action. Working with

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:53.212
that county and I'm also great

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:54.780
to the procedures you provided

02:05:54.847 --> 02:05:57.149
us. To have I have to do more

02:05:57.216 --> 02:05:59.118
techno. Since it. To make him a-

02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:03.455
I do want to be honest about

02:06:03.522 --> 02:06:04.089
the challenges and I think I'll

02:06:04.156 --> 02:06:04.690
close with that have. You I'm

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:05.257
glad we can have a specific

02:06:05.324 --> 02:06:06.959
panel on on statewide goals and

02:06:07.026 --> 02:06:10.663
metrics because- we really do

02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:12.898
have. An impact I pray. And by

02:06:12.965 --> 02:06:13.499
setting ourselves some goals

02:06:13.565 --> 02:06:14.033
and then working with the

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:16.802
counties many a county. Things

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:17.436
that matter that measure that

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:19.238
are really impactful as

02:06:19.305 --> 02:06:21.173
Michelle had mentioned- but we

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:21.774
had don't yet tell that story

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:27.579
at the statewide level. Am I

02:06:27.646 --> 02:06:28.213
due a refund when that is that

02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:29.381
is the best part of an HSA is

02:06:29.448 --> 02:06:35.921
this local flexibility in the

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:36.922
local control because. We are

02:06:36.989 --> 02:06:39.058
able to represent tumors in

02:06:39.124 --> 02:06:40.960
families in planning because

02:06:41.026 --> 02:06:41.560
then. You know we are not the

02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:42.995
needs of LA is said. Then that

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:43.629
flexibility is a real challenge

02:06:43.696 --> 02:06:44.697
when it comes to innovation

02:06:44.763 --> 02:06:46.899
fund because some of the best

02:06:46.966 --> 02:06:50.202
innovations are when you were

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:50.803
first follower Nanda so the

02:06:50.869 --> 02:06:51.770
first time to do something but

02:06:51.837 --> 02:06:56.809
taking a with. Ex and spreading

02:06:56.875 --> 02:07:02.514
across the state and so. Lots

02:07:02.581 --> 02:07:03.048
of reading work happening

02:07:03.115 --> 02:07:03.682
around the psychosis mentioning

02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:05.284
that. For kids. You get the men

02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:05.884
within two weeks and if you're

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:07.052
waiting a few years. It was

02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:09.154
mentioned but of people with

02:07:09.221 --> 02:07:09.788
mental illness self medicating

02:07:09.855 --> 02:07:11.056
with substances and a working

02:07:11.123 --> 02:07:12.825
how lame is trying to recognize

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:14.793
that these clean lines we used

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:15.361
to see between substance use

02:07:15.427 --> 02:07:17.162
disorder and mental illness or

02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:19.064
not so clean anymore and when

02:07:19.131 --> 02:07:19.698
especially young people present

02:07:19.765 --> 02:07:23.802
was psychosis as a family

02:07:23.869 --> 02:07:25.971
doctor it's a it's a futile

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:26.605
exercise to try to say is this

02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:33.712
because there's like- because

02:07:33.779 --> 02:07:34.346
they're using math we- people

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:35.014
where we are. To beat Pete

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:37.216
telling a- especially with kids

02:07:37.282 --> 02:07:50.229
the street is a. To work in a

02:07:50.295 --> 02:07:56.568
state that's invested. So

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:57.169
heavily in the care of their

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:57.770
most vulnerable with the band

02:07:57.836 --> 02:08:00.639
and. During the many people and

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:04.943
we haven't made a film kept.

02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:06.845
But we can do better portal

02:08:06.912 --> 02:08:11.050
called on the table to. Thank

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:17.890
you. Members when it's Ralph

02:08:17.956 --> 02:08:18.424
when visiting the sailors

02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:19.058
office as you may know back in

02:08:19.124 --> 02:08:19.691
Feb or two thousand eighteen we

02:08:19.758 --> 02:08:20.292
should report on the funding

02:08:20.359 --> 02:08:20.859
and oversight of the mental

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:21.460
health services act and found

02:08:21.527 --> 02:08:23.128
significant challenges. That

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:25.531
prevented the effective use of.

02:08:25.597 --> 02:08:27.332
But it period of eleven twelve

02:08:27.399 --> 02:08:34.206
through fifteen sixteen one of

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:34.773
the main issues we found was

02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:38.911
that health service. Oversight

02:08:38.977 --> 02:08:39.545
of the counties and use of the

02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:44.883
funds was not effective. Purses

02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:45.451
did not fired guidance to

02:08:45.517 --> 02:08:49.455
counties regarding how to spend

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:50.089
that much safe fun and it was

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:50.656
lacking in its ability to

02:08:50.722 --> 02:08:51.490
oversee what how if the funds

02:08:51.557 --> 02:08:54.860
are spent appropriately. This

02:08:54.927 --> 02:08:59.631
concerns on oversight allowed

02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:00.265
to hundreds of dollars to spend

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:00.899
every. That could have been re

02:09:00.966 --> 02:09:07.172
giver. Okay back to other

02:09:07.239 --> 02:09:09.108
counties so they could be used

02:09:09.174 --> 02:09:11.143
to provide those services. Port

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:13.245
debt of nearly three hundred

02:09:13.312 --> 02:09:14.813
ninety million dollars as July

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:15.347
seventeen that was subject

02:09:15.414 --> 02:09:19.151
reversion. The state law did at

02:09:19.218 --> 02:09:23.922
the in act one time change a

02:09:23.989 --> 02:09:24.523
two thousand seventeen that'll

02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:28.560
locals to retain those funds. A

02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:30.829
group plan on. What was our

02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:35.000
concern that health. Not this

02:09:35.067 --> 02:09:40.839
stylish no plane river. Says

02:09:40.906 --> 02:09:43.041
has established a reversion

02:09:43.108 --> 02:09:46.145
process- for reverting unspent

02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:48.480
funds to it up to the counter

02:09:48.547 --> 02:09:49.081
and then out reallocated back

02:09:49.148 --> 02:09:56.622
to the counties. The thing. We.

02:09:56.688 --> 02:09:58.991
Also concerned with was with

02:09:59.057 --> 02:10:02.895
the level of image say funds

02:10:02.961 --> 02:10:03.562
that the counties. In receptors.

02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:05.631
A lot but so far the

02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:06.265
appropriate reserve level we've

02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:12.838
always held reserves. Five

02:10:12.905 --> 02:10:13.472
hundred and thirty five million

02:10:13.539 --> 02:10:14.540
dollars. Which was reserve will

02:10:14.606 --> 02:10:17.209
pull of a proxy 4% or else is

02:10:17.276 --> 02:10:19.077
identify most reserve what

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:20.946
about 33% which would have

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:21.547
freed up a hundred and fifty

02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:22.714
seven million dollars in

02:10:22.781 --> 02:10:25.050
additional funding they could

02:10:25.117 --> 02:10:25.584
have been used for mental

02:10:25.651 --> 02:10:29.054
service says- since our audit

02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:31.290
in two thousand eighteen the

02:10:31.356 --> 02:10:33.258
legislator. Legislator in SP

02:10:33.325 --> 02:10:36.828
one nine two amended state law

02:10:36.895 --> 02:10:44.937
I captopril reserve a 33% Again

02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:45.504
this is something that was

02:10:45.571 --> 02:10:47.039
important. Edits also we noted

02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:55.080
that SP one ninety to clarify

02:10:55.147 --> 02:11:01.753
that. The in. P. C. A. S. we

02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:04.957
humbly dot in unsafe. Of

02:11:05.023 --> 02:11:05.557
interest that had just been a

02:11:05.624 --> 02:11:06.692
key. Yes but interest falls

02:11:06.758 --> 02:11:07.292
principle this could offer. To

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:10.996
be. Force structure. And of

02:11:11.063 --> 02:11:13.298
levels will help ensure that

02:11:13.365 --> 02:11:14.800
the candies actually spend the

02:11:14.866 --> 02:11:17.135
money and not just a mass

02:11:17.202 --> 02:11:17.669
hundred million dollars in

02:11:17.736 --> 02:11:27.179
unspent funds. We also noted so

02:11:27.246 --> 02:11:29.014
positive approved Paul the day.

02:11:29.081 --> 02:11:31.083
Since since we- interactive

02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:32.818
image say transparency database

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:34.953
on its public website that

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:35.420
provides financial and

02:11:35.487 --> 02:11:36.922
informational information on

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:40.926
the state programs among the

02:11:40.993 --> 02:11:41.460
tables you can review and

02:11:41.526 --> 02:11:43.195
compare eventually funded

02:11:43.262 --> 02:11:45.197
programs a key characteristics

02:11:45.264 --> 02:11:46.765
such as target populations

02:11:46.832 --> 02:11:53.472
budgets and program goals.

02:11:53.538 --> 02:11:57.409
Including prevention and early

02:11:57.476 --> 02:11:58.010
intervention funds- this was

02:11:58.076 --> 02:11:58.543
something that available.

02:11:58.610 --> 02:11:59.177
That's set up. Understanding of

02:11:59.244 --> 02:12:02.848
where the funding is good. Been

02:12:02.914 --> 02:12:05.050
approved of that information

02:12:05.117 --> 02:12:06.852
was available at the county

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:07.386
levels but you have to go

02:12:07.452 --> 02:12:09.321
through report after report and

02:12:09.388 --> 02:12:10.956
I don't think that's something

02:12:11.023 --> 02:12:12.958
that the average person was

02:12:13.025 --> 02:12:15.127
doing now that's available

02:12:15.193 --> 02:12:15.694
publicly with thing that's a

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:24.970
positive thing. We all did that

02:12:25.037 --> 02:12:25.504
at the time a report the

02:12:25.570 --> 02:12:26.872
counties were. Not providing

02:12:26.938 --> 02:12:27.306
their annual revenue

02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:29.174
expenditure reports on time.

02:12:29.241 --> 02:12:29.741
Matter of fact at the twelve

02:12:29.808 --> 02:12:30.309
and these were. It reported

02:12:30.375 --> 02:12:33.045
some he health care services

02:12:33.111 --> 02:12:39.384
has established a process them.

02:12:39.451 --> 02:12:45.991
To withhold 25% of actual of

02:12:46.058 --> 02:12:57.202
annual. At current county

02:12:57.269 --> 02:13:00.706
finally. I do also want to

02:13:00.772 --> 02:13:02.941
mention that we do have a

02:13:03.008 --> 02:13:03.542
current auto involving images

02:13:03.608 --> 02:13:06.812
Hey although we cannot see.

02:13:06.878 --> 02:13:08.914
Letterman pitcher short act

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:11.016
LPS- regarding the in treatment

02:13:11.083 --> 02:13:13.218
for resources for patients or

02:13:13.285 --> 02:13:15.020
involuntarily held- the scope

02:13:15.087 --> 02:13:17.155
of this because I would you say

02:13:17.222 --> 02:13:17.756
is the primary funding source

02:13:17.823 --> 02:13:22.728
for county mental services. The

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:23.328
audit will touch or may touch

02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:26.865
upon funding and out. Existing

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:29.201
programs in counties so that

02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:30.902
report is US scheduled to

02:13:30.969 --> 02:13:38.510
release in April twenty twenty.

02:13:38.577 --> 02:13:39.878
The concludes my remarks. And

02:13:39.945 --> 02:13:45.784
I'm available for any questions

02:13:45.851 --> 02:13:46.318
thank you Sir next we have

02:13:46.385 --> 02:13:49.054
doctor Eberhart. I'm in the

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:49.554
first panel on my rand

02:13:49.621 --> 02:13:51.089
corporation colleagues and I

02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:51.723
have been paying sixty three. I

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:53.158
programming for over eight

02:13:53.225 --> 02:13:54.926
years I will use some of the

02:13:54.993 --> 02:14:00.298
things from these evaluations

02:14:00.365 --> 02:14:00.932
to inform some of the questions

02:14:00.999 --> 02:14:03.135
posed to this panel. You pose

02:14:03.201 --> 02:14:03.702
the question this California

02:14:03.769 --> 02:14:07.939
need a larger and- did not

02:14:08.006 --> 02:14:08.573
directly. Funding level for P.

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:11.810
I. investments. However our

02:14:11.877 --> 02:14:12.878
valuation findings to provide

02:14:12.944 --> 02:14:18.817
at. The I. programs are

02:14:18.884 --> 02:14:19.418
beneficial and that investing

02:14:19.484 --> 02:14:21.987
in PI. In your stream cost

02:14:22.053 --> 02:14:27.392
savings for the state. With

02:14:27.459 --> 02:14:27.959
respect to benefits be found

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:28.527
that Los Angeles county. My

02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:32.631
server is and so our men's

02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:35.967
community engagement pain in

02:14:36.034 --> 02:14:36.601
the county that's fully engaged

02:14:36.668 --> 02:14:39.771
in people and- how to get help

02:14:39.838 --> 02:14:44.910
for a mental problem. At the

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:47.679
state level we found that P. I.

02:14:47.746 --> 02:14:48.346
campaign is worse give use much.

02:14:48.413 --> 02:14:53.985
On this. Pulse services. Then

02:14:54.052 --> 02:14:54.653
to intervene with those at risk

02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:55.253
for suicide these are just a

02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:55.887
few of the benefits I. Buy our

02:14:55.954 --> 02:14:59.357
evaluations. We also found

02:14:59.424 --> 02:14:59.958
evidence at St P. I. programs

02:15:00.025 --> 02:15:05.230
yield it up. That's meant by

02:15:05.297 --> 02:15:07.732
leading a cop says this man.

02:15:07.799 --> 02:15:08.300
Yes he did with financially

02:15:08.366 --> 02:15:08.867
beneficial outcomes such as

02:15:08.934 --> 02:15:09.901
higher productivity earnings

02:15:09.968 --> 02:15:11.937
and employment programs that

02:15:12.003 --> 02:15:14.439
reduce suicide rate potential

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:17.676
to return large amounts of

02:15:17.742 --> 02:15:21.346
money to the state. The

02:15:21.413 --> 02:15:21.947
reverted medic how healthcare

02:15:22.013 --> 02:15:26.785
costs. The times and priest

02:15:26.852 --> 02:15:29.154
income tax revenue from all her

02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:29.688
life thanks again. Angel

02:15:29.754 --> 02:15:33.959
benefit is that our list of

02:15:34.025 --> 02:15:35.494
cost. It is important to

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:36.061
provide a full continuum of

02:15:36.127 --> 02:15:39.831
mental health care. Early chin

02:15:39.898 --> 02:15:41.399
to treatment for those serious

02:15:41.466 --> 02:15:46.638
mental illness spending on

02:15:46.705 --> 02:15:49.207
prevention can be controversial.

02:15:49.274 --> 02:15:49.674
When there are so many

02:15:49.741 --> 02:15:50.275
seriously mentally ill people

02:15:50.342 --> 02:15:55.480
and their needs. But the value

02:15:55.547 --> 02:15:57.048
to support the next guy. Entry

02:15:57.115 --> 02:15:59.184
incompetent they are both

02:15:59.251 --> 02:15:59.718
spectrum of mental health

02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:01.553
services. You ask to ensure the

02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:03.522
state limit the P. I. options

02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:04.055
for counties based on best

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:08.093
practices. Well I know that

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:11.563
look tension county and the cow

02:16:11.630 --> 02:16:14.733
may sit stay away yeah I put.

02:16:14.799 --> 02:16:15.300
Have carefully chosen event.

02:16:15.367 --> 02:16:17.536
This is an- elevations of these

02:16:17.602 --> 02:16:19.304
pro. Deed indicated that they

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:19.905
are effective in the diverse

02:16:19.971 --> 02:16:20.438
and vulnerable populations

02:16:20.505 --> 02:16:24.075
served in California. Although

02:16:24.142 --> 02:16:28.547
many evidence PI practices are

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:31.149
available. Counties in the

02:16:31.216 --> 02:16:31.750
state could consider using a

02:16:31.816 --> 02:16:35.020
small letter practices. But in

02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:37.689
a support. Implemented in the

02:16:37.756 --> 02:16:38.256
populations for which it is

02:16:38.323 --> 02:16:38.823
intended and delivered in a

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:40.525
manner intended but it is not

02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:42.427
feasible to monitor how a large

02:16:42.494 --> 02:16:43.061
number of practice is are being

02:16:43.128 --> 02:16:50.635
administered. This thing on a

02:16:50.702 --> 02:16:51.202
smaller subset a practice.

02:16:51.269 --> 02:16:54.873
Easier to ensure they are

02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:55.440
administered as intended and

02:16:55.507 --> 02:17:01.746
yield the did Rick. Since he is

02:17:01.813 --> 02:17:03.315
particularly if he's

02:17:03.381 --> 02:17:06.685
collaborate on investments in

02:17:06.751 --> 02:17:07.285
training monitoring out by you

02:17:07.352 --> 02:17:12.123
with. Were there are trade offs

02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:12.724
given how did California is on

02:17:12.791 --> 02:17:16.695
the- take. The county's engage

02:17:16.761 --> 02:17:18.964
in counties also need to delete

02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.598
to tailor the implementation of

02:17:19.664 --> 02:17:21.132
evidence based practices to the

02:17:21.199 --> 02:17:21.600
unique local needs and

02:17:21.666 --> 02:17:24.769
populations although there are

02:17:24.836 --> 02:17:25.236
advantages to why the

02:17:25.303 --> 02:17:27.105
implementing a smaller number

02:17:27.172 --> 02:17:28.873
of evidence based practices

02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:30.709
there in line with statewide

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:33.044
goals any effort to streamline

02:17:33.111 --> 02:17:35.080
option should consider counties

02:17:35.146 --> 02:17:35.614
needs. To be responsive to

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:39.417
local stakeholders. What

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:41.186
challenges have counties face

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:43.121
in spending their prop sixty

02:17:43.188 --> 02:17:44.856
three finds well I certainly

02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:45.490
won't go up on this issue given

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:47.158
that our evaluations did not

02:17:47.225 --> 02:17:47.692
directly address spending

02:17:47.759 --> 02:17:49.294
challenges and the other

02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:51.129
panelists here certainly better

02:17:51.196 --> 02:17:53.198
equipped to weigh in. But I am

02:17:53.264 --> 02:17:54.799
aware that some counties have

02:17:54.866 --> 02:17:55.433
not been spending out their P.

02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:57.268
I. dollars which might give the

02:17:57.335 --> 02:17:59.137
impression that the funds are

02:17:59.204 --> 02:18:01.039
not needed. However some county

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:01.673
support that they have trouble

02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:04.275
spending P. I. funds because

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:08.680
the funding stream is viewed as

02:18:08.747 --> 02:18:09.280
not being flexible enough to

02:18:09.347 --> 02:18:11.549
meet their needs. For instance

02:18:11.616 --> 02:18:13.118
county state that the time

02:18:13.184 --> 02:18:13.752
frame in which funds need to be

02:18:13.818 --> 02:18:20.992
spent makes it pulled you stop

02:18:21.059 --> 02:18:25.030
and launch. A new program. In

02:18:25.096 --> 02:18:28.867
counties may still have some.

02:18:28.933 --> 02:18:32.971
Yeah hi I just say. Challenging.

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:34.839
And accountability how lex

02:18:34.906 --> 02:18:37.108
ability in using P. I find. I

02:18:37.175 --> 02:18:37.575
appreciate having the

02:18:37.642 --> 02:18:38.209
opportunity to weigh in today

02:18:38.276 --> 02:18:39.244
based on my experience as an

02:18:39.310 --> 02:18:39.844
evaluator of prop sixty three

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:41.146
funded program since twenty

02:18:41.212 --> 02:18:41.780
eleven in the interest of time

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:43.081
I try to keep my comments today

02:18:43.148 --> 02:18:45.216
focused with limited examples

02:18:45.283 --> 02:18:45.817
very but my ran colleagues and

02:18:45.884 --> 02:18:46.918
I have written eighty reports

02:18:46.985 --> 02:18:51.756
relevant to prop sixty three

02:18:51.823 --> 02:18:52.390
over the past eight years. And

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:52.924
I would be happy to answer

02:18:52.991 --> 02:18:55.927
questions about our work today

02:18:55.994 --> 02:19:01.332
or at a later point in time.

02:19:01.399 --> 02:19:02.667
Thank you again. He tapped.

02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:03.234
Thank you doctor Dr read the

02:19:03.301 --> 02:19:07.505
two of them. They aren't my

02:19:07.572 --> 02:19:09.007
homework read them all. There

02:19:09.074 --> 02:19:15.013
is a top. I the specifics that

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:19.851
sounds great I'm but before I

02:19:19.918 --> 02:19:20.385
begin wanted off a similar

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:25.123
refrigeration. Just anybody on

02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.757
the panel so we look at the P.

02:19:25.824 --> 02:19:26.324
A. is there an integration.

02:19:26.391 --> 02:19:29.761
With the locals constraint is

02:19:29.828 --> 02:19:33.198
expelled when you look days in

02:19:33.264 --> 02:19:35.433
the schools and we talk about

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:41.406
early. In. My understanding is

02:19:41.473 --> 02:19:43.408
that there is that the schools

02:19:43.475 --> 02:19:45.143
just knowing ministers to the

02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:50.682
ID population and we have. Ways

02:19:50.749 --> 02:19:51.249
to college counselors so we

02:19:51.316 --> 02:19:53.084
have this. Set of children that

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:55.253
are not supported by a mental

02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:59.124
health aspect to it. Thank you

02:19:59.190 --> 02:20:01.626
up legislation just been passed.

02:20:01.693 --> 02:20:02.193
But it's still going through

02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:03.294
the part of education on how

02:20:03.361 --> 02:20:10.034
it's supposed to be implemented

02:20:10.101 --> 02:20:10.635
is there a collaborator could

02:20:10.702 --> 02:20:15.673
her. Are there because it's

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:16.307
being gullible to administer to

02:20:16.374 --> 02:20:21.212
children. To phase. There are

02:20:21.279 --> 02:20:23.715
lot example counties

02:20:23.782 --> 02:20:25.884
collaborating with schools-

02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:26.451
Alameda county has a very

02:20:26.518 --> 02:20:28.219
aggressive program of using

02:20:28.286 --> 02:20:35.326
their P. E. I. finds through

02:20:35.393 --> 02:20:36.728
their schools Sam. Plaster

02:20:36.795 --> 02:20:39.164
county I'm less certainly Los

02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.664
Angeles and I think you

02:20:39.731 --> 02:20:42.834
Michelle might have tells. Only

02:20:42.901 --> 02:20:44.803
made a commitment and the

02:20:44.869 --> 02:20:45.403
directors here if you can talk

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:46.037
about that a parting with their

02:20:46.104 --> 02:20:47.238
schools. I am a few years ago.

02:20:47.305 --> 02:20:49.240
Mission set aside a portion of

02:20:49.307 --> 02:20:51.242
our SPD two funds in order to

02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:53.244
incentivize these partnerships

02:20:53.311 --> 02:20:55.213
and- more than a third of the

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.881
counties stepped up to the

02:20:56.948 --> 02:20:57.448
plate. And applied we were

02:20:57.515 --> 02:21:01.052
unable to provide funds to all

02:21:01.119 --> 02:21:01.719
of those counties some counties

02:21:01.786 --> 02:21:07.192
indicated they wanted to they

02:21:07.258 --> 02:21:09.227
didn't have the capacity to go.

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:13.164
Through the application process

02:21:13.231 --> 02:21:13.765
that led to the passage of the

02:21:13.832 --> 02:21:14.365
mental health student services

02:21:14.432 --> 02:21:17.202
act. X. I'm. To do that there

02:21:17.268 --> 02:21:19.237
is had. That would get in the

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:21.239
way of school in county

02:21:21.306 --> 02:21:23.107
partnerships however as you

02:21:23.174 --> 02:21:25.243
heard there are some rules and

02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:25.844
there are some restrictions in

02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:29.113
and what we find. Is that the

02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:31.049
will is often there but what's

02:21:31.115 --> 02:21:32.984
missing is the house. In that

02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:36.988
these partners can struggle and

02:21:37.055 --> 02:21:37.622
how to cook how to collaborate

02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:39.290
because of differences in

02:21:39.357 --> 02:21:41.226
culture because of training

02:21:41.292 --> 02:21:48.533
rules- often- miss sender

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:49.200
endings of the vagaries of hip

02:21:49.267 --> 02:21:53.705
and verba. Fat both federal

02:21:53.771 --> 02:21:54.305
policies that restrict it and

02:21:54.372 --> 02:21:57.542
sharing. Same time their tents

02:21:57.609 --> 02:22:02.947
from throughout the state. Sure

02:22:03.014 --> 02:22:05.650
pull the information out of

02:22:05.717 --> 02:22:08.319
those examples I think what you

02:22:08.386 --> 02:22:08.920
heard from the auditor with

02:22:08.987 --> 02:22:14.058
reference to the transparency

02:22:14.125 --> 02:22:16.661
informational website. Is

02:22:16.728 --> 02:22:19.163
there's more out there than we

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:19.764
can keep track of but what we

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:22.867
want to do. Eight experts best

02:22:22.934 --> 02:22:23.468
to be able to learn from their

02:22:23.534 --> 02:22:29.173
peers and so I would say yes it

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:30.942
is happening. All over the

02:22:31.009 --> 02:22:31.576
state but it is not happening

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:32.143
in every community and every

02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:36.881
school. Today a major. Cool

02:22:36.948 --> 02:22:37.415
county health and school

02:22:37.482 --> 02:22:38.850
districts in almost every

02:22:38.917 --> 02:22:40.952
county throughout the state

02:22:41.019 --> 02:22:42.754
what we don't have is the scale

02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:44.889
so that in every school site

02:22:44.956 --> 02:22:47.425
you have a county behavioral

02:22:47.492 --> 02:22:58.169
health partnership. And what

02:22:58.236 --> 02:22:58.803
I've learned from folks is that

02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:00.338
there are several- years to

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:00.872
this one as their explicit

02:23:00.939 --> 02:23:03.241
mandate. We've done a lot of

02:23:03.308 --> 02:23:05.209
work. Partnership putting the

02:23:05.276 --> 02:23:07.178
map the budget- which Toby just

02:23:07.245 --> 02:23:08.780
referenced but the other piece

02:23:08.846 --> 02:23:11.015
is- you know you have to have

02:23:11.082 --> 02:23:12.784
willing partners on both sides

02:23:12.850 --> 02:23:15.219
and- on I would say that you

02:23:15.286 --> 02:23:16.988
know right now the best way

02:23:17.055 --> 02:23:19.290
that we can approach this is by

02:23:19.357 --> 02:23:22.660
trying to organize a pot luck

02:23:22.727 --> 02:23:28.833
of financing where everybody is

02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:30.835
a little bit. Into the bowl- of

02:23:30.902 --> 02:23:32.770
all children in California our

02:23:32.837 --> 02:23:34.973
medic how eligible the other

02:23:35.039 --> 02:23:37.008
for not and fix. The car. Want

02:23:37.075 --> 02:23:38.977
a screening for insurance when

02:23:39.043 --> 02:23:39.544
a student comes through the

02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:41.446
door. Needing services and so

02:23:41.512 --> 02:23:43.481
we have to figure out a way to

02:23:43.548 --> 02:23:45.149
account for that half of the

02:23:45.216 --> 02:23:47.051
population that is not medic

02:23:47.118 --> 02:23:49.120
hal reimbursable so that's one

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:50.922
kind of structural barriers. Or

02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:53.057
issue that we need to get to-

02:23:53.124 --> 02:23:55.093
the other piece to your

02:23:55.159 --> 02:23:57.095
excellent point is that there

02:23:57.161 --> 02:24:01.733
are. School be based at mental

02:24:01.799 --> 02:24:03.001
health or behavioral health

02:24:03.067 --> 02:24:05.136
support providers in schools

02:24:05.203 --> 02:24:07.672
today who are really trained in

02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:10.274
oriented around helping

02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:12.543
students be prepared to learn

02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:13.011
and to achieve their

02:24:13.077 --> 02:24:19.050
educational goal and I want to

02:24:19.117 --> 02:24:19.617
be really clear. That the V.

02:24:19.684 --> 02:24:23.221
work that we're putting forward.

02:24:23.287 --> 02:24:25.390
About supplementing those Sir

02:24:25.456 --> 02:24:27.225
it's not I. Am replacing being

02:24:27.291 --> 02:24:29.027
replaced by them it's a

02:24:29.093 --> 02:24:31.095
different. Service talk. Kenny

02:24:31.162 --> 02:24:33.531
behavioral health then in need

02:24:33.598 --> 02:24:34.132
for us to ever going to really

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:35.266
get to this population based

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:35.833
prevention model of median

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:38.036
children in families where

02:24:38.102 --> 02:24:40.138
they're at and you know after

02:24:40.204 --> 02:24:44.909
the age of five I it is Dr I'm

02:24:44.976 --> 02:24:47.011
black kids don't. Time. In the

02:24:47.078 --> 02:24:49.313
pediatrician's office- you know

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:49.914
my daughter so excited she she

02:24:49.981 --> 02:24:51.349
does they're back couple years.

02:24:51.416 --> 02:24:53.117
And so unless you get sick we

02:24:53.184 --> 02:24:55.086
don't go to the doctor- and but

02:24:55.153 --> 02:24:57.355
where kids are is in school and

02:24:57.422 --> 02:24:59.123
where their- issues are likely

02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:01.192
to be getting surface through

02:25:01.259 --> 02:25:03.027
behavioral issues in the

02:25:03.094 --> 02:25:05.363
classroom and so you know we're

02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:07.465
already seeing the results of

02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:11.969
this and yes- are Fresno county

02:25:12.036 --> 02:25:12.570
directors here and she's got a

02:25:12.637 --> 02:25:17.041
fence sick model in place but-

02:25:17.108 --> 02:25:17.642
they're- much more we could do

02:25:17.708 --> 02:25:21.045
is this. Aston tools- schools

02:25:21.112 --> 02:25:21.646
also have very limited space

02:25:21.712 --> 02:25:23.147
available for one on one

02:25:23.214 --> 02:25:23.781
behavioral health sections and

02:25:23.848 --> 02:25:24.348
so that's another kind of

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:25.116
structural issue. But we can

02:25:25.183 --> 02:25:29.887
get over those hurdles- if we

02:25:29.954 --> 02:25:41.099
really. Have a will to double

02:25:41.165 --> 02:25:48.739
down on this. Piece of the

02:25:48.806 --> 02:25:55.079
continuum. And so but soon it

02:25:55.146 --> 02:25:55.580
is simply to think about

02:25:55.646 --> 02:25:57.482
charters. To know K. twelve

02:25:57.548 --> 02:25:58.883
need to think be thinking about

02:25:58.950 --> 02:26:00.985
those this pre K. opportunities

02:26:01.052 --> 02:26:03.187
as well- but the opportunities

02:26:03.254 --> 02:26:04.856
are also there for those

02:26:04.922 --> 02:26:05.389
students that were serving

02:26:05.456 --> 02:26:12.730
their community colleges who

02:26:12.797 --> 02:26:19.403
often vulnerable. Because of

02:26:19.470 --> 02:26:19.971
poverty and other kinds of

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:20.838
issues but also there are you.

02:26:20.905 --> 02:26:21.439
I had some conversations with

02:26:21.506 --> 02:26:24.842
universe. System about what we

02:26:24.909 --> 02:26:25.409
can build some collaborative

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:26.878
partnerships between K. and

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:28.980
that the campus. Also those

02:26:29.046 --> 02:26:31.015
places with a lots of expensive

02:26:31.082 --> 02:26:31.649
areas of expertise particulars

02:26:31.716 --> 02:26:32.250
campuses at that have health

02:26:32.316 --> 02:26:33.117
systems and so we really are

02:26:33.184 --> 02:26:34.952
trying to facilitate the kinds

02:26:35.019 --> 02:26:36.888
of parts of that you're talking

02:26:36.954 --> 02:26:38.789
about and I would say the peace

02:26:38.856 --> 02:26:40.825
that that that really encourage

02:26:40.892 --> 02:26:41.492
you to think about is the T. is

02:26:41.559 --> 02:26:42.793
the technical assistance pace.

02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.996
It it it can be very difficult

02:26:45.062 --> 02:26:45.563
for asking people to change

02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:47.298
their behavior to change how

02:26:47.365 --> 02:26:49.200
they spend money to share risk

02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:50.868
for institutions that have

02:26:50.935 --> 02:26:53.337
historically competed with each

02:26:53.404 --> 02:26:54.705
other right they go they go

02:26:54.772 --> 02:26:56.874
before you well then they say

02:26:56.941 --> 02:26:57.475
every dollar that goes into

02:26:57.542 --> 02:26:59.010
health is a dollar that's not

02:26:59.076 --> 02:27:00.912
available for education or vice

02:27:00.978 --> 02:27:03.414
versa and now we're trying to

02:27:03.481 --> 02:27:04.048
say we have to win. To actually

02:27:04.115 --> 02:27:09.453
leverage bow. I appreciate

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:10.788
that. But if he- ever was made

02:27:10.855 --> 02:27:11.322
for you say that the most.

02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:14.892
Effective this can occur. Where

02:27:14.959 --> 02:27:17.128
they are in in in mass you know

02:27:17.195 --> 02:27:20.998
when we talk about. Early

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:22.934
education home what a child

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.069
could feel comfortable about

02:27:25.136 --> 02:27:25.603
reaching out about anxiety

02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:28.839
about other issues about.

02:27:28.906 --> 02:27:31.142
Anything that has about a

02:27:31.209 --> 02:27:31.742
mental health component that

02:27:31.809 --> 02:27:33.344
it's okay the stigma can be

02:27:33.411 --> 02:27:37.181
removed and that there. Well to

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:37.848
reach out to that individual on

02:27:37.915 --> 02:27:40.918
site to get the help. Because I

02:27:40.985 --> 02:27:42.887
mean kids can be me. And it

02:27:42.954 --> 02:27:44.989
starts right snowballing and so

02:27:45.056 --> 02:27:45.556
I'm just hoping that we can.

02:27:45.623 --> 02:27:48.693
Start a- start a process

02:27:48.759 --> 02:27:51.128
through the health class

02:27:51.195 --> 02:27:52.897
whatever it is. That we have

02:27:52.964 --> 02:27:55.066
that. Dialogue with that each

02:27:55.132 --> 02:27:56.934
individual student saying. Okay

02:27:57.001 --> 02:27:58.903
if you're feeling anxiety or if

02:27:58.970 --> 02:27:59.437
you're feeling suicidal if

02:27:59.503 --> 02:28:04.809
you're feeling what ever. Talk

02:28:04.875 --> 02:28:07.178
to social. Back in the day what

02:28:07.245 --> 02:28:07.712
does a school we had that

02:28:07.778 --> 02:28:11.082
counselor. Okay the kids today

02:28:11.148 --> 02:28:12.984
don't have those counselors on

02:28:13.050 --> 02:28:14.752
site. And a lot of my schools.

02:28:14.819 --> 02:28:17.088
And so we called the trainers.

02:28:17.154 --> 02:28:18.990
Has the ID population is

02:28:19.056 --> 02:28:21.192
supported you know and- I think

02:28:21.259 --> 02:28:23.127
that we need to be able to.

02:28:23.194 --> 02:28:24.962
Look at the collaboration from

02:28:25.029 --> 02:28:29.100
the mental health experts with.

02:28:29.166 --> 02:28:30.901
Be a part of education. And

02:28:30.968 --> 02:28:33.137
collaborate how we can better

02:28:33.204 --> 02:28:38.509
advance billionaire

02:28:38.576 --> 02:28:46.617
intervention and education- to

02:28:46.684 --> 02:28:53.491
be able to have. That. Santa

02:28:53.557 --> 02:28:57.895
Barbara CM and not orange enter

02:28:57.962 --> 02:28:58.496
a Kern sounds of this percent

02:28:58.562 --> 02:29:03.067
of our a and deal that we had a

02:29:03.134 --> 02:29:03.601
over a hundred fifty high

02:29:03.668 --> 02:29:05.002
school age students who came

02:29:05.069 --> 02:29:08.806
together for and mental health

02:29:08.873 --> 02:29:09.407
division I. The university of

02:29:09.473 --> 02:29:10.007
California Santa Barbara. What

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:13.277
they groups with some adult

02:29:13.344 --> 02:29:14.845
allies but very much you've

02:29:14.912 --> 02:29:17.982
driven- almost to a one they

02:29:18.049 --> 02:29:20.017
identified the need for a safe

02:29:20.084 --> 02:29:25.923
place on campus where young

02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.524
people could decompress relax

02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:28.993
could seek help right they they

02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:31.128
propose bean bags in hand next

02:29:31.195 --> 02:29:33.064
hanging chair. In open plan

02:29:33.130 --> 02:29:33.698
it's a new things you need to

02:29:33.764 --> 02:29:35.199
do to create a safe place for

02:29:35.266 --> 02:29:35.666
young people but very

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:36.934
consistent with with with with

02:29:37.001 --> 02:29:38.969
your observation that's what

02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:42.139
young people said that they

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:42.707
need in their counties- the

02:29:42.773 --> 02:29:44.909
outcome of that we hope is that

02:29:44.975 --> 02:29:47.111
the counties that were in the

02:29:47.178 --> 02:29:47.712
room heard from their use as

02:29:47.778 --> 02:29:48.913
part of a community planning

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:52.583
process what we want to do is

02:29:52.650 --> 02:29:53.184
bring those counties together

02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:55.286
to say how to make that happen.

02:29:55.353 --> 02:29:56.787
So they don't reinvent the

02:29:56.854 --> 02:29:57.421
wheel how do we begin to remove

02:29:57.488 --> 02:29:59.256
some of the barriers to making

02:29:59.323 --> 02:30:01.025
that happen how do we do the

02:30:01.092 --> 02:30:02.927
education there S. identify

02:30:02.993 --> 02:30:06.831
funding streams you can. Use

02:30:06.897 --> 02:30:07.398
that matches the innovation

02:30:07.465 --> 02:30:08.032
funds that you can use P. E. I.

02:30:08.099 --> 02:30:09.967
for the- other sources of

02:30:10.034 --> 02:30:13.170
funds- but it's complicated

02:30:13.237 --> 02:30:15.773
it's difficult. Again because

02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:16.374
oftentimes these are not. That

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:17.975
have done this and so we're

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:19.043
really trying to build a

02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:21.045
partnership for doing to more

02:30:21.112 --> 02:30:31.722
of the fifth generation labs

02:30:31.789 --> 02:30:32.356
all focus on school middle off

02:30:32.423 --> 02:30:34.925
so I think. Your comments are

02:30:34.992 --> 02:30:35.526
very consistent with with what

02:30:35.593 --> 02:30:36.160
we're hearing from young people

02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:42.933
all of. Posted there. Also look

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:48.739
at the private insurers and

02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:49.373
figure out how we can hold them

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:52.877
accountable for. That summer

02:30:52.943 --> 02:30:55.045
social safety net and- yes-

02:30:55.112 --> 02:30:55.679
towards early interventions and

02:30:55.746 --> 02:30:57.214
prevention's I think it's an

02:30:57.281 --> 02:30:57.715
important part of the

02:30:57.782 --> 02:31:01.018
conversation but I wanted to

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:03.320
come back if I could to- mayor

02:31:03.387 --> 02:31:05.623
Steinberg's comments regarding.

02:31:05.689 --> 02:31:08.826
Whether there were efficiencies

02:31:08.893 --> 02:31:09.226
and focusing early

02:31:09.293 --> 02:31:13.898
interventions and. I come at it

02:31:13.964 --> 02:31:17.234
trying to figure out if there

02:31:17.301 --> 02:31:21.205
is a way for us to. Either sent

02:31:21.272 --> 02:31:23.207
a virus or encouraged and types

02:31:23.274 --> 02:31:25.676
of programs so that we could

02:31:25.743 --> 02:31:26.977
have collaboration at a

02:31:27.044 --> 02:31:29.180
statewide level. I look towards

02:31:29.246 --> 02:31:29.713
the early psychosis as an

02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:31.549
example of one of those types

02:31:31.615 --> 02:31:34.752
of programs without again

02:31:34.819 --> 02:31:35.186
trying to be overly

02:31:35.252 --> 02:31:37.087
prescriptive. With any specific

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:40.991
proposal but simply if that

02:31:41.058 --> 02:31:43.260
county was having issues with a

02:31:43.327 --> 02:31:44.862
certain metric trying to meet

02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:47.131
T. their trauma or child

02:31:47.198 --> 02:31:52.536
welfare system. Could we have a

02:31:52.603 --> 02:31:53.170
learning collaborative could we

02:31:53.237 --> 02:31:56.974
have similar to the end. Later

02:31:57.041 --> 02:31:57.541
that we have that could be

02:31:57.608 --> 02:31:59.376
helpful in allowing counties

02:31:59.443 --> 02:31:59.977
tell learn best practices from

02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:02.980
other counties. Wondering if

02:32:03.047 --> 02:32:05.282
you had a calming you are

02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.850
describing the state of the

02:32:05.916 --> 02:32:14.525
MHSAA today and. What I would

02:32:14.592 --> 02:32:17.027
say is that you know on early

02:32:17.094 --> 02:32:19.129
psychosis at has been a focus

02:32:19.196 --> 02:32:21.665
there how. Fast it. MHM on with

02:32:21.732 --> 02:32:25.135
some federal grants but.

02:32:25.202 --> 02:32:27.338
Referring to my we have early

02:32:27.404 --> 02:32:30.007
psychosis programs in more than

02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:31.909
half of our counties either up

02:32:31.976 --> 02:32:34.011
or into mensa thirty five out

02:32:34.078 --> 02:32:38.883
of five fifty eight counties

02:32:38.949 --> 02:32:40.551
early psychosis programs not

02:32:40.618 --> 02:32:42.953
see here but probably doesn't

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:46.924
make sense to put one okay. I'm

02:32:46.991 --> 02:32:48.926
just this from my first his. We

02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:49.527
are knocking the part and the

02:32:49.593 --> 02:32:51.195
learning collaborative's are

02:32:51.262 --> 02:32:52.963
really an opportunity for the

02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.564
clinicians to get together and

02:32:53.631 --> 02:32:55.099
talk like clinical practice

02:32:55.165 --> 02:32:57.201
what's working and what's not.

02:32:57.268 --> 02:32:58.736
We are tailoring early

02:32:58.802 --> 02:32:59.336
psychosis intervention so we

02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:01.205
lifted one up in one county and

02:33:01.272 --> 02:33:04.842
found that for the largely

02:33:04.909 --> 02:33:06.844
immigrant monolingual Spanish

02:33:06.911 --> 02:33:07.478
speaking population that they

02:33:07.545 --> 02:33:09.146
were supposed to be serving the

02:33:09.213 --> 02:33:13.050
provider was not. Hitting the

02:33:13.117 --> 02:33:13.551
target they had English

02:33:13.617 --> 02:33:15.319
speaking clinicians they were

02:33:15.386 --> 02:33:15.886
not meeting the place where

02:33:15.953 --> 02:33:16.854
they were at culturally-

02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:19.356
linguistically we modified the

02:33:19.423 --> 02:33:22.893
program we said do over we need

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:23.527
to a retailer this program so

02:33:23.594 --> 02:33:25.262
that meets the needs of this

02:33:25.329 --> 02:33:26.764
particular community in

02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:27.398
geography. That's exactly what

02:33:27.464 --> 02:33:29.333
we should be doing on early

02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:31.368
psychosis and I think you know

02:33:31.435 --> 02:33:47.952
it's early days because the

02:33:48.018 --> 02:33:54.792
field is kind of early. Days.

02:33:54.858 --> 02:33:56.894
Really laugh sting. I'm I think

02:33:56.961 --> 02:33:58.796
the question then becomes.

02:33:58.862 --> 02:34:04.568
Those other kind of more home

02:34:04.635 --> 02:34:07.471
grown types of innovations that

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:14.211
we're implementing where to. We

02:34:14.278 --> 02:34:15.546
open. Up the space for clients

02:34:15.613 --> 02:34:19.083
and we say tell us how you want

02:34:19.149 --> 02:34:31.395
to be done tell us how you get

02:34:31.462 --> 02:34:31.996
and they tell us do we not.

02:34:32.062 --> 02:34:32.596
Move for some of these other.

02:34:32.663 --> 02:34:35.466
You know more pointed north

02:34:35.532 --> 02:34:40.971
star star type of goal. And.

02:34:41.038 --> 02:34:43.207
Then we just need your full be

02:34:43.273 --> 02:34:44.942
we've read. And some space.

02:34:45.009 --> 02:34:51.015
Create an evidence based around

02:34:51.081 --> 02:34:51.515
community defy diss that

02:34:51.582 --> 02:34:52.149
otherwise wouldn't be available

02:34:52.216 --> 02:34:52.783
we're not perfect it's not you

02:34:52.850 --> 02:34:53.350
know I won't say that there

02:34:53.417 --> 02:34:53.951
isn't room for improvement in

02:34:54.018 --> 02:34:54.485
terms of- all all of the

02:34:54.551 --> 02:34:55.152
various dimensions of diversity.

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:57.354
Being out do not reflect the

02:34:57.421 --> 02:34:59.056
populations that we need to

02:34:59.123 --> 02:35:01.358
serve in California and those

02:35:01.425 --> 02:35:01.992
are areas where we could make

02:35:02.059 --> 02:35:03.227
targeted investments in

02:35:03.293 --> 02:35:05.996
different ways from a workforce

02:35:06.063 --> 02:35:09.600
development standpoint- but and

02:35:09.667 --> 02:35:10.868
we also need to be mindful that

02:35:10.934 --> 02:35:14.905
are talked to by- psycho social

02:35:14.972 --> 02:35:15.539
model and so it's not all about

02:35:15.606 --> 02:35:17.074
clinical part right some of

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:19.109
this stuff for the people for

02:35:19.176 --> 02:35:21.412
medical model for may feel

02:35:21.478 --> 02:35:24.948
kinda squishy but it might be

02:35:25.015 --> 02:35:25.549
just as if not more effect of

02:35:25.616 --> 02:35:26.884
it getting to where they need

02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:28.986
to be in terms of their

02:35:29.053 --> 02:35:30.954
recovery. And so I think- you

02:35:31.021 --> 02:35:33.190
know yes some focus is helpful

02:35:33.257 --> 02:35:37.094
because maybe it'll give folks

02:35:37.161 --> 02:35:38.262
more confidence in the work

02:35:38.328 --> 02:35:40.197
that we're doing but in terms

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:42.766
of some of the specific exam

02:35:42.833 --> 02:35:51.208
were given. All our response.

02:35:51.275 --> 02:35:51.809
That's what we're doing right

02:35:51.875 --> 02:35:52.443
now today in something. It may

02:35:52.509 --> 02:35:54.278
feel like it's not enough like

02:35:54.344 --> 02:35:54.878
on the school based tips right

02:35:54.945 --> 02:35:58.716
we're not in every school.

02:35:58.782 --> 02:35:59.316
Comes a girly side assist. A

02:35:59.383 --> 02:36:03.020
foreign at in right now New

02:36:03.087 --> 02:36:07.524
York doing pretty well as well

02:36:07.591 --> 02:36:08.125
but they're small I hear what

02:36:08.192 --> 02:36:13.530
you're Sir. You know I was.

02:36:13.597 --> 02:36:15.099
Troubled I think is the best

02:36:15.165 --> 02:36:18.902
word can by the auditor had any

02:36:18.969 --> 02:36:21.038
set oversights currently not

02:36:21.105 --> 02:36:23.207
active that me and went through

02:36:23.273 --> 02:36:27.478
two fifteen and sixteen. But

02:36:27.544 --> 02:36:28.112
and we have done quite a bit in

02:36:28.178 --> 02:36:28.679
the recent budgets that will

02:36:28.746 --> 02:36:29.246
help us to ensure adequate.

02:36:29.313 --> 02:36:31.515
Reserves as well as counties

02:36:31.582 --> 02:36:33.650
ability to be able to spend

02:36:33.717 --> 02:36:34.251
within their three plans. But

02:36:34.318 --> 02:36:42.126
I'm trying to. Really look at

02:36:42.192 --> 02:36:43.160
this as. A resource to limit

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:49.500
and we. The dollars we have

02:36:49.566 --> 02:36:53.003
and- I tend to focus looking

02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:54.805
now cops now I've actually been

02:36:54.872 --> 02:36:57.040
moved a bit by brands who.

02:36:57.107 --> 02:36:59.076
Reminds a we are people who are

02:36:59.143 --> 02:37:01.078
seeking care who receive the

02:37:01.145 --> 02:37:01.645
care and aren't just numbers

02:37:01.712 --> 02:37:04.915
and how important it is for us

02:37:04.982 --> 02:37:05.482
to look at the whole person

02:37:05.549 --> 02:37:07.017
within this discussion. But my

02:37:07.084 --> 02:37:23.534
fear is we do have limited

02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:33.043
resources and how do we.

02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:34.511
Effectively apply. This

02:37:34.578 --> 02:37:38.982
discussion. The currently

02:37:39.049 --> 02:37:39.550
occurring at the county wide

02:37:39.616 --> 02:37:41.251
level. Okay I'm on its side

02:37:41.318 --> 02:37:45.255
it's make. Us better on the

02:37:45.322 --> 02:37:47.224
whole we welcome accountability

02:37:47.291 --> 02:37:47.791
in for you each of the lines

02:37:47.858 --> 02:37:49.293
they tend. Going into this new

02:37:49.359 --> 02:37:51.261
role knowing that our team is

02:37:51.328 --> 02:37:53.096
working hard to address them

02:37:53.163 --> 02:37:54.998
that the- revision process was

02:37:55.065 --> 02:37:57.201
implemented this last round of

02:37:57.267 --> 02:37:58.936
revisions was less than 1% of

02:37:59.002 --> 02:37:59.536
the total budget so we see

02:37:59.603 --> 02:38:02.806
counties really stepping up-

02:38:02.873 --> 02:38:03.440
and doing the work to make sure

02:38:03.507 --> 02:38:04.608
the funds are spent

02:38:04.675 --> 02:38:07.177
responsibly- the reserve. Issue

02:38:07.244 --> 02:38:09.079
clearly was an issue and now

02:38:09.146 --> 02:38:09.646
that we have the legislation

02:38:09.713 --> 02:38:17.955
capping reserves there's a plan

02:38:18.021 --> 02:38:18.589
to make sure that each county.

02:38:18.655 --> 02:38:20.357
Goes down to that reserve level

02:38:20.424 --> 02:38:22.960
curse. Clear and if they got

02:38:23.026 --> 02:38:29.700
the L. A. C. could you. On the

02:38:29.766 --> 02:38:32.836
phone AS teach CS the command

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:35.038
to modern their data. Brand

02:38:35.105 --> 02:38:37.007
before but then we and I think

02:38:37.074 --> 02:38:37.574
we're gonna be better five

02:38:37.641 --> 02:38:38.208
years from now than where we

02:38:38.275 --> 02:38:41.612
are now- the lateness of the-

02:38:41.678 --> 02:38:45.649
ari ours has been resolved a I-

02:38:45.716 --> 02:38:46.250
it turns out when you withhold

02:38:46.316 --> 02:38:48.051
money that people. Work in on

02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:48.886
time I don't think it's the

02:38:48.952 --> 02:38:56.026
only mechanism that this the

02:38:56.093 --> 02:38:57.461
store closes counties. It

02:38:57.527 --> 02:38:58.061
should be during the case I

02:38:58.128 --> 02:38:59.296
think it worked and we look

02:38:59.363 --> 02:39:02.966
forward. To an ecstatic. M.

02:39:03.033 --> 02:39:03.533
chair you may. Take because

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:04.167
this work and I just wanted to

02:39:04.234 --> 02:39:04.768
point out and it might be the

02:39:04.835 --> 02:39:05.636
nice transition to the next

02:39:05.702 --> 02:39:09.039
panel. Is that project started

02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:09.506
with building a data

02:39:09.573 --> 02:39:12.910
foundation. For the early

02:39:12.976 --> 02:39:14.778
psychosis programs building off

02:39:14.845 --> 02:39:16.847
of the New York model actually

02:39:16.914 --> 02:39:18.815
and we recently brought. The

02:39:18.882 --> 02:39:21.385
folks from NIMH and from

02:39:21.451 --> 02:39:23.287
ontrack New York to Sacramento.

02:39:23.353 --> 02:39:25.222
In partnership with them some

02:39:25.289 --> 02:39:28.825
of the different administration

02:39:28.892 --> 02:39:33.864
and counties- but a hundred

02:39:33.931 --> 02:39:37.067
fifty people. To look at that

02:39:37.134 --> 02:39:38.869
model but I won't. Say that I'm-

02:39:38.936 --> 02:39:39.469
thanks to me we're trying to

02:39:39.536 --> 02:39:40.837
get done where we have a model

02:39:40.904 --> 02:39:42.839
how do we implemented with

02:39:42.906 --> 02:39:43.473
fidelity to the point that rand

02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:45.142
is making. How do we build the

02:39:45.208 --> 02:39:47.044
agreement across providers in

02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:49.012
terms of the data that we're

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:50.948
collecting and analyze that in

02:39:51.014 --> 02:39:53.116
a way that uniform. So that we

02:39:53.183 --> 02:39:53.617
can tell the press the

02:39:53.684 --> 02:39:56.186
individual story the

02:39:56.253 --> 02:39:56.720
programmatic story and the

02:39:56.787 --> 02:39:59.089
statewide story and the intent

02:39:59.156 --> 02:39:59.723
is that we do have a statewide

02:39:59.790 --> 02:40:02.826
system over. The services that

02:40:02.893 --> 02:40:03.393
are available to everybody

02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:05.028
including Sierra county even

02:40:05.095 --> 02:40:05.629
though Sierra county may not

02:40:05.696 --> 02:40:07.030
operate a program through

02:40:07.097 --> 02:40:08.865
regional approaches to that

02:40:08.932 --> 02:40:10.834
collaboration. And I do think

02:40:10.901 --> 02:40:11.401
that is where California's

02:40:11.468 --> 02:40:13.070
farthest along in terms of

02:40:13.136 --> 02:40:21.645
building out the infrastructure.

02:40:21.712 --> 02:40:25.115
Again data data data right and

02:40:25.182 --> 02:40:25.749
that can lead to the kinds of.

02:40:25.816 --> 02:40:28.885
And ten other read. So push us

02:40:28.952 --> 02:40:29.519
to move towards the most cost

02:40:29.586 --> 02:40:31.355
effective the most efficient

02:40:31.421 --> 02:40:33.190
care because we can begin to

02:40:33.256 --> 02:40:35.025
look at how quickly as doctor

02:40:35.092 --> 02:40:37.160
fiver says the two week

02:40:37.227 --> 02:40:39.796
engagement versus the two year

02:40:39.863 --> 02:40:47.437
engagement what does that mean

02:40:47.504 --> 02:40:48.071
in terms of proving educational

02:40:48.138 --> 02:40:50.741
outcomes reducing. On reducing

02:40:50.807 --> 02:40:52.709
its involvement well if we can

02:40:52.776 --> 02:40:53.310
do that for this eco system we

02:40:53.377 --> 02:40:54.878
do that in. Their component.

02:40:54.945 --> 02:40:57.180
And I do believe that is a- way

02:40:57.247 --> 02:41:00.851
into our third panel thank you.

02:41:00.917 --> 02:41:04.988
So you don't this is a. Okay

02:41:05.055 --> 02:41:10.027
yeah well then I won't. Go into

02:41:10.093 --> 02:41:15.832
the thought about it. Your view

02:41:15.899 --> 02:41:25.108
of the. Yeah thank you for any.

02:41:25.175 --> 02:41:37.988
Do you. This is. Do it. Well we

02:41:38.055 --> 02:41:38.555
but I think you're- a little

02:41:38.622 --> 02:41:46.997
bit. Yeah okay. You know. I'm

02:41:47.064 --> 02:41:56.807
leaving I'm just taking. We

02:41:56.873 --> 02:42:03.146
will begin our third panel on

02:42:03.213 --> 02:42:03.747
transformation the alchemists

02:42:03.814 --> 02:42:06.750
based director you talked. Yeah

02:42:06.817 --> 02:42:07.384
in chair and members- you take

02:42:07.451 --> 02:42:09.019
the behavioral health director

02:42:09.086 --> 02:42:11.121
in Fresno county and a special-

02:42:11.188 --> 02:42:13.356
greeting to my assembly member

02:42:13.423 --> 02:42:15.692
and a doctor were ambulance. A

02:42:15.759 --> 02:42:17.094
county behavior health

02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:18.929
directors support a movement

02:42:18.995 --> 02:42:19.496
away from MHS state funded

02:42:19.563 --> 02:42:21.164
programs are built around

02:42:21.231 --> 02:42:22.933
finding percentages and instead

02:42:22.999 --> 02:42:23.533
moving toward accountability

02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:25.202
for outcomes because we also

02:42:25.268 --> 02:42:29.106
want to know how do we use data

02:42:29.172 --> 02:42:29.573
science and outcomes

02:42:29.639 --> 02:42:31.108
measurement to improve people's

02:42:31.174 --> 02:42:42.285
lives rather than show

02:42:42.352 --> 02:42:42.819
compliance with rules and

02:42:42.886 --> 02:42:45.188
regulations. Which were pretty

02:42:45.255 --> 02:42:45.822
good act counties today collect

02:42:45.889 --> 02:42:49.192
the men. And use that as a

02:42:49.259 --> 02:42:49.659
programmatic into. It

02:42:49.726 --> 02:42:50.193
extensively by the best

02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:50.994
research institutions

02:42:51.061 --> 02:42:51.561
throughout the state you've

02:42:51.628 --> 02:42:54.297
heard from brand UCLA and UC

02:42:54.364 --> 02:42:57.334
Berkeley have also done studies

02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:57.901
of some of our programs. To

02:42:57.968 --> 02:42:58.502
understand of our efforts are

02:42:58.568 --> 02:43:00.904
working. And often they are.

02:43:00.971 --> 02:43:02.739
Are full service partnership

02:43:02.806 --> 02:43:03.206
model which has been

02:43:03.273 --> 02:43:05.008
repeatedly- evaluated has

02:43:05.075 --> 02:43:07.043
demonstrated to work for

02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:08.979
reducing hospitalizations

02:43:09.045 --> 02:43:13.450
emergency room visits

02:43:13.517 --> 02:43:16.786
incarceration and homelessness.

02:43:16.853 --> 02:43:19.589
All of which are important.

02:43:19.656 --> 02:43:20.190
Goals for the people we serve

02:43:20.257 --> 02:43:27.497
the problem. Transparency place.

02:43:27.564 --> 02:43:34.771
We. Counties in the event.

02:43:34.838 --> 02:43:35.405
Ending but the structure of the

02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:37.340
funding which is built around

02:43:37.407 --> 02:43:37.974
both aspirational goals as well

02:43:38.041 --> 02:43:45.916
as in fast funding percentages

02:43:45.982 --> 02:43:46.516
with categorical. Grant

02:43:46.583 --> 02:43:49.085
programs within those has not

02:43:49.152 --> 02:43:52.822
served us well allocations the

02:43:52.889 --> 02:43:53.456
percent yes that community this

02:43:53.523 --> 02:43:55.358
is. It works even less well in

02:43:55.425 --> 02:43:57.227
small counties which have to be

02:43:57.294 --> 02:43:58.962
more integrated and we're 20%

02:43:59.029 --> 02:43:59.596
of a small overall image as say

02:43:59.663 --> 02:44:01.264
allotment is a really small

02:44:01.331 --> 02:44:02.933
amount as an example I'll give

02:44:02.999 --> 02:44:05.068
you. Alpine county which has a

02:44:05.135 --> 02:44:07.370
population of one thousand one

02:44:07.437 --> 02:44:09.072
hundred compared to my county

02:44:09.139 --> 02:44:09.606
which is a little over a

02:44:09.673 --> 02:44:11.208
million- the MHSAA allotment

02:44:11.274 --> 02:44:13.076
for two thousand and seventeen

02:44:13.143 --> 02:44:14.978
was two hundred and seventy

02:44:15.045 --> 02:44:15.612
five thousand dollars. Total to

02:44:15.679 --> 02:44:18.848
meet all of the program thank

02:44:18.915 --> 02:44:19.416
and regulatory requirements

02:44:19.482 --> 02:44:20.050
which have been laid out by the

02:44:20.116 --> 02:44:22.852
state. Another important point

02:44:22.919 --> 02:44:23.420
is that there are often not

02:44:23.486 --> 02:44:25.222
clean lines between the

02:44:25.288 --> 02:44:26.923
components for example we have

02:44:26.990 --> 02:44:27.490
innovations which are also

02:44:27.557 --> 02:44:29.025
prevention and early

02:44:29.092 --> 02:44:31.027
intervention. Focused and

02:44:31.094 --> 02:44:31.561
there's been historically

02:44:31.628 --> 02:44:33.263
blurred lines between what

02:44:33.330 --> 02:44:36.833
constitutes P. E. I. in CSS due

02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:37.434
to a lack of clear guidance at

02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:39.102
times from the state. Rather

02:44:39.169 --> 02:44:41.004
than get hung up and ensuring

02:44:41.071 --> 02:44:43.306
compliance with funding

02:44:43.373 --> 02:44:43.873
percentages we believe we

02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:45.342
should a wind around the goals

02:44:45.408 --> 02:44:47.143
that Californians want to

02:44:47.210 --> 02:44:49.045
achieve. One important note is

02:44:49.112 --> 02:44:50.914
that as a county behavior

02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:51.548
health director I wear multiple

02:44:51.615 --> 02:44:53.049
hats. Which need to be

02:44:53.116 --> 02:44:55.151
considered when we develop

02:44:55.218 --> 02:44:57.020
outcomes we are part public

02:44:57.087 --> 02:44:58.855
behavioral health part

02:44:58.922 --> 02:45:01.024
departments we are a medical

02:45:01.091 --> 02:45:02.859
specialty mental health plan

02:45:02.926 --> 02:45:04.961
were an insurance company. And

02:45:05.028 --> 02:45:05.629
we also deliver direct services

02:45:05.695 --> 02:45:08.765
are oversee the direct-

02:45:08.832 --> 02:45:09.366
provision of services and we

02:45:09.432 --> 02:45:13.103
are 1100% accountable to our

02:45:13.169 --> 02:45:13.670
local communities and their

02:45:13.737 --> 02:45:17.207
stakeholders. Based on this

02:45:17.274 --> 02:45:17.807
unique perspective I offer the

02:45:17.874 --> 02:45:19.142
following for efforts to shift

02:45:19.209 --> 02:45:21.378
away from the funding buckets

02:45:21.444 --> 02:45:21.845
to a system based on

02:45:21.911 --> 02:45:24.981
accountability for outcomes.

02:45:25.048 --> 02:45:25.649
Any outcomes we develop need to

02:45:25.715 --> 02:45:27.050
be measurable based on

02:45:27.117 --> 02:45:29.019
available data and reflect not

02:45:29.085 --> 02:45:31.221
just the over arching statewide

02:45:31.288 --> 02:45:32.989
goals for MHSAA but need to

02:45:33.056 --> 02:45:35.091
reflect local priorities as

02:45:35.158 --> 02:45:36.826
well and stakeholder needs. We

02:45:36.893 --> 02:45:39.329
can't have a one size fits all

02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:41.097
approach for example we know

02:45:41.164 --> 02:45:43.033
that suicide rates in

02:45:43.099 --> 02:45:43.600
California's rural northern

02:45:43.667 --> 02:45:45.235
counties are much higher than

02:45:45.302 --> 02:45:46.936
the rest of the state and might

02:45:47.003 --> 02:45:49.072
need different approaches. We

02:45:49.139 --> 02:45:50.774
want to move to a population

02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:53.043
health based model. And the

02:45:53.109 --> 02:45:53.476
more restrictive and

02:45:53.543 --> 02:45:55.178
categorical we get with our

02:45:55.245 --> 02:45:56.880
funding particularly for

02:45:56.946 --> 02:45:58.882
prevention it really turns into

02:45:58.948 --> 02:45:59.516
not a prevention program but a

02:45:59.582 --> 02:46:03.019
fail first program you have to

02:46:03.086 --> 02:46:04.888
be homeless for to meet your

02:46:04.954 --> 02:46:06.890
needs you have to be in the

02:46:06.956 --> 02:46:07.390
involved in the criminal

02:46:07.457 --> 02:46:07.957
justice is. Pressed to meet

02:46:08.024 --> 02:46:10.860
your needs as opposed to a true

02:46:10.927 --> 02:46:11.461
public health type prevention

02:46:11.528 --> 02:46:14.798
program which is for our one.

02:46:14.864 --> 02:46:16.866
The MHSAA propose outcomes also

02:46:16.933 --> 02:46:17.434
need to be aligned with the

02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:18.034
rest of our funding. An HSA

02:46:18.101 --> 02:46:19.135
represents just 20% of the full

02:46:19.202 --> 02:46:21.104
statewide investment in public

02:46:21.171 --> 02:46:21.705
behavior health spending and

02:46:21.771 --> 02:46:23.206
it's only a quarter of most

02:46:23.273 --> 02:46:25.075
counties behavior health

02:46:25.141 --> 02:46:25.675
budgets. This means that the

02:46:25.742 --> 02:46:27.310
rest of medic cow as well as

02:46:27.377 --> 02:46:29.079
funding for homelessness

02:46:29.145 --> 02:46:29.713
education in criminal justice

02:46:29.779 --> 02:46:33.149
system should be aligned with

02:46:33.216 --> 02:46:33.750
the outcomes goals that we do

02:46:33.817 --> 02:46:35.285
determine. Along the same lines

02:46:35.352 --> 02:46:37.053
as a has been mentioned

02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:39.055
previously two thirds of

02:46:39.122 --> 02:46:39.622
Californians are covered by

02:46:39.689 --> 02:46:40.957
private insurance. Not medic

02:46:41.024 --> 02:46:43.159
cal so to the degree that we

02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:44.794
are seeking to prevent those

02:46:44.861 --> 02:46:45.428
individuals from becoming so

02:46:45.495 --> 02:46:47.297
severely mentally ill that they

02:46:47.364 --> 02:46:48.932
qualify for county behavior

02:46:48.998 --> 02:46:50.867
health services. And by the way

02:46:50.934 --> 02:46:52.769
I have parents contact me

02:46:52.836 --> 02:46:53.403
regularly finding out how they

02:46:53.470 --> 02:46:54.838
can get their kids off their

02:46:54.904 --> 02:46:56.673
insurance in inter county

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:57.307
behavioral health services. The

02:46:57.374 --> 02:47:01.111
state along me. Lawmakers need

02:47:01.177 --> 02:47:01.544
to ask for increased

02:47:01.611 --> 02:47:02.879
accountability for those plans

02:47:02.946 --> 02:47:04.914
as well. We recommend an

02:47:04.981 --> 02:47:05.448
approach where a body of

02:47:05.515 --> 02:47:07.450
experts which include clients

02:47:07.517 --> 02:47:09.419
family members representatives

02:47:09.486 --> 02:47:11.221
of county behavioral health.

02:47:11.287 --> 02:47:14.891
And doubt us to come together

02:47:14.958 --> 02:47:17.160
with the state. To assess

02:47:17.227 --> 02:47:18.795
available down and did. Post

02:47:18.862 --> 02:47:21.231
white outcomes- if we should

02:47:21.297 --> 02:47:21.698
not write it into an

02:47:21.765 --> 02:47:24.768
initiative- we need to be able

02:47:24.834 --> 02:47:30.039
to- make. As flexible respond

02:47:30.106 --> 02:47:33.042
to emergent public health needs

02:47:33.109 --> 02:47:33.543
and improvements in data

02:47:33.610 --> 02:47:35.011
collection a measurement

02:47:35.078 --> 02:47:37.013
science so as we learn things.

02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:37.614
People to change the outcome.

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:39.182
Bond to that- and by writing it

02:47:39.249 --> 02:47:41.284
in it just made a costly and

02:47:41.351 --> 02:47:41.785
inefficient to make any

02:47:41.851 --> 02:47:44.821
changes- county behavior health

02:47:44.888 --> 02:47:47.056
directors but- strongly that we

02:47:47.123 --> 02:47:47.690
should allow for the majesty of

02:47:47.757 --> 02:47:51.060
find services for individuals

02:47:51.127 --> 02:47:51.661
with the primary S. U. decent

02:47:51.728 --> 02:47:57.167
diagnosis. Often hard to get in

02:47:57.233 --> 02:48:06.910
under. That at the. Underlying

02:48:06.976 --> 02:48:07.410
mental illness when some

02:48:07.477 --> 02:48:08.077
struggle a deck and. Ideas move

02:48:08.144 --> 02:48:09.179
individuals away from is it.

02:48:09.245 --> 02:48:09.712
Safe whether it's in jails

02:48:09.779 --> 02:48:10.947
impatient for a cycling in

02:48:11.014 --> 02:48:13.116
enough homelessness allow. Flux

02:48:13.183 --> 02:48:14.918
lady to deal with what I reckon.

02:48:14.984 --> 02:48:19.155
But in our. Use this much were

02:48:19.222 --> 02:48:21.090
swept in that progress. Given

02:48:21.157 --> 02:48:21.724
the complexity of the variables

02:48:21.791 --> 02:48:23.026
were dealing with and the

02:48:23.092 --> 02:48:23.626
breadth of the scope of our

02:48:23.693 --> 02:48:24.260
work accountability should come

02:48:24.327 --> 02:48:24.961
in the form of technical

02:48:25.028 --> 02:48:25.462
assistance training and

02:48:25.528 --> 02:48:28.898
investment to drive improved

02:48:28.965 --> 02:48:30.900
quality and outcomes throughout

02:48:30.967 --> 02:48:33.336
the state understanding that

02:48:33.403 --> 02:48:33.770
California's diverse

02:48:33.837 --> 02:48:34.871
communities will require us to

02:48:34.938 --> 02:48:37.440
embrace differences based on

02:48:37.507 --> 02:48:39.042
population speeds. Finally it's

02:48:39.108 --> 02:48:40.944
a bit surprising to me that

02:48:41.010 --> 02:48:47.951
we've barely touched on the

02:48:48.017 --> 02:48:50.787
concept of the. Massive amount

02:48:50.854 --> 02:48:51.421
a lack of affordable housing in

02:48:51.488 --> 02:48:55.291
cal. I could not our obligation

02:48:55.358 --> 02:48:57.193
to serve the homeless

02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:58.995
population. And we will not

02:48:59.062 --> 02:49:02.999
solve homelessness unless those

02:49:03.066 --> 02:49:13.676
in a position of authority are

02:49:13.743 --> 02:49:14.811
accountable for addressing. The

02:49:14.878 --> 02:49:16.779
need for affordable housing in

02:49:16.846 --> 02:49:18.982
our state we cannot stick our

02:49:19.048 --> 02:49:19.516
head in the sand. And that

02:49:19.582 --> 02:49:21.084
we're simply going to solve.

02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:24.954
The first show that we have.

02:49:25.021 --> 02:49:25.588
Ninety days in with very full

02:49:25.655 --> 02:49:26.222
shelters that filled up within

02:49:26.289 --> 02:49:27.123
a couple of weeks these are

02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:31.928
people you know we typically

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:35.832
hear from. A lot of our local

02:49:35.899 --> 02:49:36.366
elected officials not you

02:49:36.432 --> 02:49:54.617
doctor. The. The homeless on

02:49:54.684 --> 02:49:55.552
our street in front so

02:49:58.288 --> 02:49:58.388
. To be

02:49:58.454 --> 02:50:00.356
housed in yeah the shelter.

02:50:00.423 --> 02:50:04.861
Days they're not. The ability

02:50:04.928 --> 02:50:05.461
to get a lease on mon for very

02:50:05.528 --> 02:50:07.163
sinister reason. The housing

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:07.764
for them and sub what to them

02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:09.399
until they can build a rental

02:50:09.465 --> 02:50:11.100
history- we have other programs

02:50:11.167 --> 02:50:22.345
have gotten three no. Place

02:50:22.412 --> 02:50:23.947
like home awards that we're

02:50:24.013 --> 02:50:26.916
working on but still- into

02:50:26.983 --> 02:50:27.550
account those in authority has

02:50:27.617 --> 02:50:28.117
a waiting list of forty to

02:50:28.184 --> 02:50:29.085
fifty thousand people. Need a

02:50:29.152 --> 02:50:31.020
portable housing. Got dressed

02:50:31.087 --> 02:50:31.621
that issue in California or we

02:50:31.688 --> 02:50:33.089
will not solve homelessness. We

02:50:33.156 --> 02:50:33.723
see the outcomes and how we've

02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:35.058
been able to transform

02:50:35.124 --> 02:50:37.160
individual lives- you heard a

02:50:37.226 --> 02:50:39.095
little bit and mention of our

02:50:39.162 --> 02:50:41.097
schools program- that program

02:50:41.164 --> 02:50:43.232
became operational in January

02:50:43.299 --> 02:50:45.234
of this year and we're already

02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:47.136
seeing. Three and four fold

02:50:47.203 --> 02:50:49.238
increases in access to mental

02:50:49.305 --> 02:50:54.510
health in our rural areas- with

02:50:54.577 --> 02:50:55.044
the advent of our schools

02:50:55.111 --> 02:51:00.016
partnership. In that program

02:51:00.083 --> 02:51:00.450
prevention and early

02:51:00.516 --> 02:51:05.154
intervention. Used to Kate

02:51:05.221 --> 02:51:07.123
school. Teacher things like.

02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:10.994
Impact on. Regulation the

02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:13.162
impact on adult responses to

02:51:13.229 --> 02:51:15.264
student behavior and strategies

02:51:15.331 --> 02:51:17.266
for D. aesculap E. de

02:51:17.333 --> 02:51:19.102
escalating behavior including

02:51:19.168 --> 02:51:19.569
verbal strategies and

02:51:19.636 --> 02:51:23.172
environmental supports- they're

02:51:23.239 --> 02:51:24.974
teaching mindfulness and

02:51:25.041 --> 02:51:25.608
developing trauma response of

02:51:25.675 --> 02:51:41.924
class rooms- and we are getting

02:51:41.991 --> 02:51:42.892
referrals not just to tell.

02:51:42.959 --> 02:51:44.994
Kids who insurance right the

02:51:45.061 --> 02:51:48.765
most and poor school district.

02:51:48.831 --> 02:51:49.332
Some of the riffs wells were

02:51:49.399 --> 02:51:49.899
from kids with an insurance

02:51:49.966 --> 02:51:50.833
screened in with mental health

02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:51.434
it is a hub and spoke model.

02:51:51.501 --> 02:51:53.236
Services in schools they can

02:51:53.302 --> 02:51:53.870
get services in the hub as well

02:51:53.936 --> 02:51:54.437
as in the community and in

02:51:54.504 --> 02:51:55.138
their home and we are providing

02:51:55.204 --> 02:51:55.772
services to charter schools as

02:51:55.838 --> 02:51:57.273
well it's a five year rollout

02:51:57.340 --> 02:51:59.409
in alternately every school in

02:51:59.475 --> 02:52:01.177
Fresno county will have access

02:52:01.244 --> 02:52:04.981
to that program- we're engaging

02:52:05.048 --> 02:52:05.615
in learning collaborative's you

02:52:05.682 --> 02:52:07.050
heard mentioned the-

02:52:07.116 --> 02:52:08.851
psychiatric advance directive

02:52:08.918 --> 02:52:09.452
Fresno in Monterey or taking

02:52:09.519 --> 02:52:11.254
the lead on that we want the

02:52:11.320 --> 02:52:13.089
people we serve. To have a role

02:52:13.156 --> 02:52:15.024
in determining- even the

02:52:15.091 --> 02:52:17.160
response to them during a

02:52:17.226 --> 02:52:19.228
crisis and we're really looking

02:52:19.295 --> 02:52:21.264
forward to that work- but it's

02:52:21.330 --> 02:52:23.332
still not enough as we don't

02:52:23.399 --> 02:52:26.736
really have a single aggregator

02:52:26.803 --> 02:52:31.140
or entity responsible for the

02:52:31.207 --> 02:52:31.774
evaluation of the effectiveness

02:52:31.841 --> 02:52:33.309
of. Graham. Directors of said

02:52:33.376 --> 02:52:34.911
loud and clear we are ready to

02:52:34.977 --> 02:52:35.411
demonstrate. Ability the

02:52:35.478 --> 02:52:38.948
outcomes put before us we just

02:52:39.015 --> 02:52:39.549
need more flexibility and the

02:52:39.615 --> 02:52:41.184
right set of measures to

02:52:41.250 --> 02:52:43.553
harness the strengths of our

02:52:43.619 --> 02:52:44.220
unique public behavioral health

02:52:44.287 --> 02:52:47.090
system. Thank you for the

02:52:47.156 --> 02:52:47.657
opportunity to address the

02:52:47.724 --> 02:52:48.224
committee and I'm happy to

02:52:48.291 --> 02:52:49.158
answer any question. Thank you

02:52:49.225 --> 02:52:50.893
director you talked to viewing.

02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:55.031
Thank you again to be doing on

02:52:55.098 --> 02:52:55.598
behalf of the mental health

02:52:55.665 --> 02:52:56.165
services over some kind of a

02:52:56.232 --> 02:53:04.474
commission. Know that the

02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:05.041
original nineteen ninety one

02:53:05.108 --> 02:53:09.579
realignment. Was structured

02:53:09.645 --> 02:53:10.213
where the funding would. So the

02:53:10.279 --> 02:53:10.813
lot tremendous amount of flex.

02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:12.849
In exchange for tents on out.

02:53:12.915 --> 02:53:14.851
Away from that man it leaves

02:53:14.917 --> 02:53:16.753
the state side in the sense

02:53:16.819 --> 02:53:19.055
that we struggled to identify

02:53:19.122 --> 02:53:21.891
this key metrics although we

02:53:21.958 --> 02:53:22.492
have them- in many instances

02:53:22.558 --> 02:53:24.894
they're not regularly use for

02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:29.866
example the budget process or

02:53:29.932 --> 02:53:30.500
or to shape. Policy discussions

02:53:30.566 --> 02:53:35.805
it's the same time. We have not

02:53:35.872 --> 02:53:39.008
made the center. In her with

02:53:39.075 --> 02:53:39.675
the L. S. comments in the right.

02:53:39.742 --> 02:53:41.077
Haitian you're aware with leave

02:53:41.144 --> 02:53:43.212
presented on the commission's

02:53:43.279 --> 02:53:44.914
work to make information

02:53:44.981 --> 02:53:45.448
available on finding on

02:53:45.515 --> 02:53:50.186
programs and outcomes. And so

02:53:50.253 --> 02:53:52.388
we're making some progress we

02:53:52.455 --> 02:53:53.022
are working with the department

02:53:53.089 --> 02:53:56.559
to get today. Tax dollars in

02:53:56.626 --> 02:54:04.967
revenues in nature. Than funds

02:54:05.034 --> 02:54:07.236
I deeply that we need to stand

02:54:07.303 --> 02:54:07.770
on the fuller picture. Of

02:54:07.837 --> 02:54:11.207
finding. Who highlight or shame

02:54:11.274 --> 02:54:12.975
those counties that are

02:54:13.042 --> 02:54:15.645
spending dollars that's not the

02:54:15.711 --> 02:54:16.279
issue at all this too is to

02:54:16.345 --> 02:54:16.913
actually resource the

02:54:16.979 --> 02:54:19.115
communities that are doing

02:54:19.182 --> 02:54:19.649
planning is to help them

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:21.050
understand what options are

02:54:21.117 --> 02:54:23.085
available how much money do you

02:54:23.152 --> 02:54:23.686
have to spend what's on the

02:54:23.753 --> 02:54:25.454
table and recognizing the

02:54:25.521 --> 02:54:30.059
damages say is 20% overall but

02:54:30.126 --> 02:54:30.660
in some communities it's more

02:54:30.726 --> 02:54:31.828
than that it's twenty five or

02:54:31.894 --> 02:54:36.933
thirty or forty percent. Of the

02:54:36.999 --> 02:54:37.533
counties funding we ought to

02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:42.205
look at the other five that are

02:54:42.271 --> 02:54:45.107
available to ask. This question.

02:54:45.174 --> 02:54:47.076
Missed opportunities dried up

02:54:47.143 --> 02:54:49.779
the kinds of analyses that we

02:54:49.846 --> 02:54:52.348
need to be able to do in terms

02:54:52.415 --> 02:54:55.751
of funding the programs pieces

02:54:55.818 --> 02:54:56.219
the second part of our

02:54:56.285 --> 02:55:02.558
transparency effort and again

02:55:02.625 --> 02:55:03.059
that is to help people

02:55:03.125 --> 02:55:04.427
understand what's out there as

02:55:04.493 --> 02:55:05.628
a given county. To understand

02:55:05.695 --> 02:55:07.129
who's doing well what. The most

02:55:07.196 --> 02:55:07.730
common health program in which

02:55:07.797 --> 02:55:11.367
to help. I'm more need there

02:55:11.434 --> 02:55:13.169
then we can accommodate at the

02:55:13.236 --> 02:55:15.271
moment this strategy of helping

02:55:15.338 --> 02:55:16.873
the public and helping

02:55:16.939 --> 02:55:19.108
stakeholders understand what's

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:21.043
in place today who they're

02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.577
surveying and how and how

02:55:21.644 --> 02:55:27.950
impactful I think is the

02:55:28.017 --> 02:55:28.551
foundational piece to really.

02:55:28.618 --> 02:55:32.154
Move the state towards outcomes

02:55:32.221 --> 02:55:32.788
it means crowdsourcing at a now

02:55:32.855 --> 02:55:34.590
that's about on healthcare this

02:55:34.657 --> 02:55:37.126
is. What what city is here and

02:55:37.193 --> 02:55:39.161
it's okay can do. Simple he

02:55:39.228 --> 02:55:39.762
said that the out. Mentioned

02:55:39.829 --> 02:55:41.197
earlier to but the FSP data and

02:55:41.264 --> 02:55:42.965
we're saying he never can-

02:55:43.032 --> 02:55:45.167
improvements in reducing

02:55:45.234 --> 02:55:46.769
criminal justice involvement

02:55:46.836 --> 02:55:50.773
but that's at a tiny area. Very

02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:51.340
tiny area we are currently

02:55:51.407 --> 02:55:53.409
investing. In understanding how

02:55:53.476 --> 02:55:55.211
to link school data with mental

02:55:55.278 --> 02:55:57.513
health data so we can

02:55:57.580 --> 02:55:58.981
understand the impact that

02:55:59.048 --> 02:55:59.649
these kinds of programs have on

02:55:59.715 --> 02:56:01.317
children and families. We're

02:56:01.384 --> 02:56:03.185
trying to work the eighty day

02:56:03.252 --> 02:56:05.021
to link mental health and

02:56:05.087 --> 02:56:07.023
employment data we want to work

02:56:07.089 --> 02:56:09.191
with the SS ensemble for data

02:56:09.258 --> 02:56:11.093
we have an active contact with

02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:13.195
UCLA to skin all of the data

02:56:13.262 --> 02:56:13.763
sets that are available to

02:56:13.829 --> 02:56:15.031
help. States and other

02:56:15.097 --> 02:56:17.366
countries are actually

02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:17.900
measuring performance for

02:56:17.967 --> 02:56:19.168
mental health and they've given

02:56:19.235 --> 02:56:21.270
us some preliminary information

02:56:21.337 --> 02:56:23.239
on a couple of the P. E. I.

02:56:23.306 --> 02:56:25.141
comes but the intent is to

02:56:25.207 --> 02:56:35.351
actually build out those

02:56:35.418 --> 02:56:35.952
metrics and begin to report.

02:56:36.018 --> 02:56:37.019
Ways that really shaped. This

02:56:37.086 --> 02:56:39.221
broad public accountability in

02:56:39.288 --> 02:56:41.390
in on we get out. In a lot. Of

02:56:41.457 --> 02:56:43.893
teams. Have been forced. Side

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:44.493
of thirty that we have is the

02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:45.561
ability. To see the dialogue

02:56:45.628 --> 02:56:48.297
just to communicate to the

02:56:48.364 --> 02:56:48.898
public what's working what's

02:56:48.965 --> 02:56:56.205
not. But we have to put with

02:56:56.272 --> 02:56:56.806
that a strategy to move from

02:56:56.872 --> 02:57:00.543
not king to what working. We

02:57:00.609 --> 02:57:03.112
lose that hope. And that that's

02:57:03.179 --> 02:57:04.981
in the public so you know

02:57:05.047 --> 02:57:05.548
consistent this I think. It

02:57:05.614 --> 02:57:07.049
thank. We could move more

02:57:07.116 --> 02:57:11.454
effectively in and we could

02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:13.856
move more expansively. If

02:57:13.923 --> 02:57:15.157
consist with the alley if the

02:57:15.224 --> 02:57:17.059
infrastructure were in place I

02:57:17.126 --> 02:57:17.660
don't think. Start with. What

02:57:17.727 --> 02:57:25.835
we need to do. Data we have in

02:57:25.901 --> 02:57:27.770
through that process. If

02:57:27.837 --> 02:57:31.107
there's the. Visit the you that

02:57:31.173 --> 02:57:33.876
require. So you know I'd I

02:57:33.943 --> 02:57:34.543
would love to talk to you some

02:57:34.610 --> 02:57:37.446
more about steps that we could

02:57:37.513 --> 02:57:38.047
take am I certainly wouldn't

02:57:38.114 --> 02:57:43.152
want to go fast or too big

02:57:43.219 --> 02:57:44.854
because this is. Complicated

02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:47.089
stuff I will say that we are

02:57:47.156 --> 02:57:47.690
farther along. Than most other

02:57:47.757 --> 02:57:49.258
states. A couple of pockets.

02:57:49.325 --> 02:57:50.860
Psicosis work in New York. And

02:57:50.926 --> 02:57:51.460
the mental health field is

02:57:51.527 --> 02:57:53.195
farther along than just about

02:57:53.262 --> 02:57:54.930
any other area of public

02:57:54.997 --> 02:57:57.299
investment. We know a lot about

02:57:57.366 --> 02:57:57.900
transportation right but when

02:57:57.967 --> 02:57:59.301
it comes to health care in the

02:57:59.368 --> 02:58:01.337
complexity of a system like

02:58:01.404 --> 02:58:05.007
this. We actually have greater

02:58:05.074 --> 02:58:07.176
transparency around dollars and

02:58:07.243 --> 02:58:09.178
programs and outcomes than in

02:58:09.245 --> 02:58:09.712
most of the public program

02:58:09.779 --> 02:58:12.915
hello. And so it. Pratt that we

02:58:12.982 --> 02:58:14.984
collectively have made even

02:58:15.051 --> 02:58:15.551
though we have to make much

02:58:15.618 --> 02:58:18.788
more thank you thank you-

02:58:18.854 --> 02:58:20.890
telling him is trying to focus

02:58:20.956 --> 02:58:24.193
some of the efforts on reducing

02:58:24.260 --> 02:58:25.227
or some of the redundant

02:58:25.294 --> 02:58:27.029
reports and so I do think

02:58:27.096 --> 02:58:27.630
there's an effort and I would

02:58:27.696 --> 02:58:31.100
like to. Lot guarding maybe

02:58:31.167 --> 02:58:31.767
there are ways within the state

02:58:31.834 --> 02:58:34.904
cap that we can. Focus or

02:58:34.970 --> 02:58:37.206
assist you in data collection

02:58:37.273 --> 02:58:39.175
but we will follow up cut off

02:58:39.241 --> 02:58:39.842
line. Next we have doctor five

02:58:39.909 --> 02:58:42.344
for. Greater will be quite

02:58:42.411 --> 02:58:43.145
brief visit when echo some of

02:58:43.212 --> 02:58:45.247
the things I heard from Toby

02:58:45.314 --> 02:58:45.915
mean transparency is a powerful

02:58:45.981 --> 02:58:52.888
chip. In my career and family

02:58:52.955 --> 02:58:55.291
medicine and the army you can

02:58:55.357 --> 02:58:56.892
change how we practice space.

02:58:56.959 --> 02:58:58.928
But I hate. The other. One of

02:58:58.994 --> 02:58:59.495
the biggest malls Peter is

02:58:59.562 --> 02:59:00.162
there are and if you can create

02:59:00.229 --> 02:59:01.063
standardized metrics we can see

02:59:01.130 --> 02:59:03.232
how you're performing. On the

02:59:03.299 --> 02:59:03.866
transparencies powerful so Hey

02:59:03.933 --> 02:59:06.068
I can see that we collect a lot

02:59:06.135 --> 02:59:13.476
of data and we don't. We could

02:59:13.542 --> 02:59:15.945
do a better job of making an

02:59:16.011 --> 02:59:16.512
intimate confirmation and I

02:59:16.579 --> 02:59:17.179
think that's what our- team for.

02:59:17.246 --> 02:59:21.183
He says this. At ten ten many

02:59:21.250 --> 02:59:22.918
counties core data formats we

02:59:22.985 --> 02:59:23.452
don't have an electronic

02:59:23.519 --> 02:59:25.154
waited- synthesize it counties

02:59:25.221 --> 02:59:27.256
are different in their

02:59:27.323 --> 02:59:27.890
geography of their population

02:59:27.957 --> 02:59:29.358
size their demographics and

02:59:29.425 --> 02:59:30.893
their work force in their

02:59:30.960 --> 02:59:32.895
programming and the work we're

02:59:32.962 --> 02:59:33.462
doing in the department of

02:59:33.529 --> 02:59:34.964
trying to integrate different

02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:37.199
data sources as part of our

02:59:37.266 --> 02:59:39.702
overall data modernization

02:59:39.768 --> 02:59:42.638
effort is slow and painful and

02:59:42.705 --> 02:59:49.545
I wish I could go faster but I

02:59:49.612 --> 02:59:50.146
can tell you we're committed.

02:59:50.212 --> 02:59:51.614
To doing that. I'm data press

02:59:51.680 --> 02:59:55.084
P. even as I was before we

02:59:55.151 --> 02:59:57.086
don't have great attention. And

02:59:57.153 --> 02:59:59.121
so we do if you are part goals

02:59:59.188 --> 03:00:01.157
set the Cup come down from our

03:00:01.223 --> 03:00:01.690
governor's office and our

03:00:01.757 --> 03:00:03.759
agency I think would be a great

03:00:03.826 --> 03:00:04.960
time deciding on what

03:00:05.027 --> 03:00:05.594
performance out. Match so the

03:00:05.661 --> 03:00:13.769
most meaningful. That can also

03:00:13.836 --> 03:00:16.872
collected given without adding

03:00:16.939 --> 03:00:17.506
additional work force these are

03:00:17.573 --> 03:00:19.275
decisions. Your name we've got

03:00:19.341 --> 03:00:21.143
a very real take a process

03:00:21.210 --> 03:00:21.777
because we do. The answers and

03:00:21.844 --> 03:00:22.411
so I think this would be one of

03:00:22.478 --> 03:00:31.220
those things that we would need

03:00:31.287 --> 03:00:34.924
to do. Collectively. We do have

03:00:34.990 --> 03:00:35.457
a great opportunity in the

03:00:35.524 --> 03:00:35.958
innovation fund and as I

03:00:36.025 --> 03:00:37.660
mentioned before. Bulls to not

03:00:37.726 --> 03:00:38.894
to look is what looks. Tell you

03:00:38.961 --> 03:00:49.638
take there's a lot. The firm

03:00:49.705 --> 03:00:50.806
proof read. The county try to

03:00:50.873 --> 03:00:52.942
figure out something that's

03:00:53.008 --> 03:00:53.542
brand new from scratch how do

03:00:53.609 --> 03:00:55.444
you take well have. Spread them

03:00:55.511 --> 03:00:57.913
and really be. Sure it works.

03:00:57.980 --> 03:00:59.148
Thank you five. Hello brand

03:00:59.215 --> 03:01:02.918
from non. Afternoon Jeremy let

03:01:02.985 --> 03:01:05.020
members of the subcommittee- my

03:01:05.087 --> 03:01:05.588
name is Angela brown and I'm

03:01:05.654 --> 03:01:06.055
here on behalf of nami

03:01:06.121 --> 03:01:10.859
California. Is that better yes.

03:01:10.926 --> 03:01:13.529
Our name is Angela Brandon I'm

03:01:13.596 --> 03:01:14.730
here on behalf of nami

03:01:14.797 --> 03:01:16.832
California we are the statewide

03:01:16.899 --> 03:01:17.399
affiliate of the country's

03:01:17.466 --> 03:01:19.001
largest mental health advocacy

03:01:19.068 --> 03:01:20.936
organization- the National

03:01:21.003 --> 03:01:23.239
Alliance on mental illness- are

03:01:23.305 --> 03:01:23.839
nineteen thousand members and

03:01:23.906 --> 03:01:25.140
sixty two affiliates include

03:01:25.207 --> 03:01:27.977
many people with serious mental

03:01:28.043 --> 03:01:28.577
illnesses their families loved

03:01:28.644 --> 03:01:30.913
ones and supporter. When the

03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:33.215
MHSAA was passed in two

03:01:33.282 --> 03:01:35.084
thousand four it was done

03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:36.885
because of so much work the

03:01:36.952 --> 03:01:37.486
dedicated advocates consumers

03:01:37.553 --> 03:01:39.054
and family members some of

03:01:39.121 --> 03:01:39.588
which are here in the room

03:01:39.655 --> 03:01:43.325
today. And it was then and

03:01:43.392 --> 03:01:46.328
still is a really remarkable

03:01:46.395 --> 03:01:46.862
thing for community mental

03:01:46.929 --> 03:01:49.198
health. It promised to

03:01:49.265 --> 03:01:59.141
transformation the mental

03:01:59.208 --> 03:01:59.742
health system from crisis.

03:01:59.808 --> 03:02:01.410
Driven to one that's focused on

03:02:01.477 --> 03:02:04.680
prevention and wellness

03:02:04.747 --> 03:02:05.314
expanding so close previously I

03:02:05.381 --> 03:02:07.149
heard population. Recovering

03:02:07.216 --> 03:02:07.683
empowerment spurred this

03:02:07.750 --> 03:02:14.890
cultural shift in the way that

03:02:14.957 --> 03:02:18.994
we think about. How. And it's

03:02:19.061 --> 03:02:21.130
through that that leasing and

03:02:21.196 --> 03:02:21.764
have more choice and- a and the

03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:23.532
door. Decisions that affect

03:02:23.599 --> 03:02:25.034
them than ever before. But

03:02:25.100 --> 03:02:26.902
we're challenged because we

03:02:26.969 --> 03:02:28.904
don't know what the impact of

03:02:28.971 --> 03:02:29.505
the billions of dollars that

03:02:29.571 --> 03:02:30.039
have been infused into the

03:02:30.105 --> 03:02:37.513
system. Has been. As shared by.

03:02:37.579 --> 03:02:38.147
Many of the folks here today on

03:02:38.213 --> 03:02:38.681
this panel in the previous

03:02:38.747 --> 03:02:39.248
panels. We can't adequately

03:02:39.315 --> 03:02:48.057
determine the and. Free hands

03:02:48.123 --> 03:02:48.691
of pulp come data about weather

03:02:48.757 --> 03:02:50.392
and- and safety programs have

03:02:50.459 --> 03:02:51.026
light proving before his lives.

03:02:51.093 --> 03:02:54.863
As we move for. Is I mean form

03:02:54.930 --> 03:02:56.932
must be the implementation of

03:02:56.999 --> 03:02:58.834
collection analysis and broad

03:02:58.901 --> 03:02:59.401
dissemination of image as a

03:02:59.468 --> 03:03:01.036
program outcomes. Right now

03:03:01.103 --> 03:03:03.238
there's no formal requirement

03:03:03.305 --> 03:03:04.907
of any of the custodial

03:03:04.973 --> 03:03:05.441
partners of the MHSAA to

03:03:05.507 --> 03:03:07.142
provide a report to the

03:03:07.209 --> 03:03:09.445
legislature on the status of

03:03:09.511 --> 03:03:10.045
the outcome in progress toward

03:03:10.112 --> 03:03:14.149
achieving I mean **** urban

03:03:14.216 --> 03:03:14.683
healthcare services does

03:03:14.750 --> 03:03:15.317
collect and provide reports on

03:03:15.384 --> 03:03:18.754
refugee. Revenue and

03:03:18.821 --> 03:03:19.388
expenditure reports- we don't

03:03:19.455 --> 03:03:21.123
have anything that really

03:03:21.190 --> 03:03:22.758
describes the impact on people

03:03:22.825 --> 03:03:24.960
and our state the whole- we

03:03:25.027 --> 03:03:25.594
would recommend that specific

03:03:25.661 --> 03:03:27.329
and measurable benchmarks and

03:03:27.396 --> 03:03:28.864
goals be determined and sat

03:03:28.931 --> 03:03:32.234
over time. And that they are

03:03:32.301 --> 03:03:32.868
based on the current statutory

03:03:32.935 --> 03:03:36.205
purpose of the image as a

03:03:36.271 --> 03:03:36.638
prevention and early

03:03:36.705 --> 03:03:37.272
intervention programs. That are

03:03:37.339 --> 03:03:43.011
attending. T. reductions in

03:03:43.078 --> 03:03:49.885
suicide incarceration. About

03:03:49.952 --> 03:03:50.486
unemployment prolong suffering

03:03:50.552 --> 03:03:51.120
homelessness remote little from

03:03:51.186 --> 03:03:52.821
their homes. And we ignite that

03:03:52.888 --> 03:03:53.355
you. Have shared that's an

03:03:53.422 --> 03:03:54.189
incredibly complex thing to do

03:03:54.256 --> 03:03:55.057
a lot of our section. That is a

03:03:55.124 --> 03:03:59.261
lot lamb and when which not

03:03:59.328 --> 03:04:00.829
everything fits sleep talks on

03:04:00.896 --> 03:04:01.463
that is the one thing that is

03:04:01.530 --> 03:04:02.965
really missing from our ability

03:04:03.031 --> 03:04:03.599
to meaningfully tell the story

03:04:03.665 --> 03:04:05.401
of how image as a is impacted.

03:04:05.467 --> 03:04:08.904
Communities and without that.

03:04:08.971 --> 03:04:10.873
Any refresh or in or

03:04:10.939 --> 03:04:11.373
reconsideration would be

03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:16.945
premature. Our organization did

03:04:17.012 --> 03:04:17.446
submit a letter to the

03:04:17.513 --> 03:04:19.114
subcommittee- I won't read that

03:04:19.181 --> 03:04:20.883
to you but I will sort of touch

03:04:20.949 --> 03:04:22.751
on some of our priority issues

03:04:22.818 --> 03:04:24.953
those are that statewide and

03:04:25.020 --> 03:04:25.554
local an HSA funded programs

03:04:25.621 --> 03:04:29.858
must be Klein and family

03:04:29.925 --> 03:04:37.299
driven- an HSA funds should not

03:04:37.366 --> 03:04:37.866
be diverted away from direct

03:04:37.933 --> 03:04:38.967
support of. This is to pay. And

03:04:39.034 --> 03:04:40.969
somehow. We've heard. From

03:04:41.036 --> 03:04:42.971
there about housing- there in.

03:04:43.038 --> 03:04:43.539
Exit program agencies tasked

03:04:43.605 --> 03:04:46.975
with dressing doesn't. It this

03:04:47.042 --> 03:04:47.509
compares statements I mean

03:04:47.576 --> 03:04:48.076
housing is more than just a

03:04:48.143 --> 03:04:48.911
place to live there's- a huge

03:04:48.977 --> 03:04:49.445
consideration for income

03:04:49.511 --> 03:04:54.149
equality in income inequality

03:04:54.216 --> 03:04:56.985
and all of the other factors

03:04:57.052 --> 03:04:57.586
that are. Leading folks on the

03:04:57.653 --> 03:04:58.887
street. Not just to healthy.

03:04:58.954 --> 03:05:01.223
It's just a fun spent on

03:05:01.290 --> 03:05:02.991
housing should assure clients

03:05:03.058 --> 03:05:03.592
caregivers and family members

03:05:03.659 --> 03:05:06.829
have access to a variety of

03:05:06.895 --> 03:05:07.463
thing assistance as their needs

03:05:07.529 --> 03:05:09.231
change over time. A fund should

03:05:09.298 --> 03:05:10.966
not be diverted to supply. It's

03:05:11.033 --> 03:05:13.135
for the treatment of housing

03:05:13.202 --> 03:05:13.735
needs of individuals with a

03:05:13.802 --> 03:05:15.304
history of criminal justice

03:05:15.370 --> 03:05:17.105
system contacts. Fund should

03:05:17.172 --> 03:05:19.475
not be diverted to supplant

03:05:19.541 --> 03:05:20.142
other entities responsibilities

03:05:20.209 --> 03:05:23.111
for children and youth who

03:05:23.178 --> 03:05:23.712
could benefit from additional

03:05:23.779 --> 03:05:24.279
mental health screening and

03:05:24.346 --> 03:05:25.180
treatment. And we've heard

03:05:25.247 --> 03:05:27.082
that. We know that their

03:05:27.149 --> 03:05:27.749
successes with the full service

03:05:27.816 --> 03:05:29.084
partnership programs and we

03:05:29.151 --> 03:05:42.397
feel strongly that a large

03:05:42.464 --> 03:05:42.931
majority of I mean just a

03:05:42.998 --> 03:05:44.266
French spent on. Community

03:05:44.333 --> 03:05:44.867
support and service should be

03:05:44.933 --> 03:05:46.668
required to implement. Partners

03:05:46.735 --> 03:05:50.973
testing for clients. It's

03:05:51.039 --> 03:05:54.877
available online as mentioned

03:05:54.943 --> 03:05:56.945
through the only see their set.

03:05:57.012 --> 03:05:57.579
Of transparency tools- you know

03:05:57.646 --> 03:05:58.113
for the first time. Ever I

03:05:58.180 --> 03:06:09.892
think it's. Builders to access

03:06:09.958 --> 03:06:10.492
what funding is available on

03:06:10.559 --> 03:06:11.093
the counter what's that some

03:06:11.159 --> 03:06:11.760
programs are being provided and-

03:06:11.827 --> 03:06:12.327
toward more direction when I

03:06:12.394 --> 03:06:15.430
got. But that's just where.

03:06:15.497 --> 03:06:16.965
We're not quite that. What we

03:06:17.032 --> 03:06:17.432
like as a cohesive and

03:06:17.499 --> 03:06:19.034
comprehensive effort to take

03:06:19.101 --> 03:06:19.668
that date until the meaningful

03:06:19.735 --> 03:06:21.436
story business my action or

03:06:21.503 --> 03:06:23.238
Dino words were more than just

03:06:23.305 --> 03:06:25.340
the date and we're more than

03:06:25.407 --> 03:06:26.842
just the numbers you know we

03:06:26.909 --> 03:06:28.844
are the successes and we are

03:06:28.911 --> 03:06:33.315
the challenges and we find a

03:06:33.382 --> 03:06:33.782
way to tell that story

03:06:33.849 --> 03:06:34.349
together. So please keep

03:06:34.416 --> 03:06:35.017
conversations continue the

03:06:35.083 --> 03:06:37.085
consideration must be made to

03:06:37.152 --> 03:06:37.686
develop a prop. That considers

03:06:37.753 --> 03:06:42.057
the future of image to say.

03:06:42.124 --> 03:06:42.724
Three more US robust effort to

03:06:42.791 --> 03:06:43.258
encourage our stakeholder

03:06:43.325 --> 03:06:46.762
community- that nothing about

03:06:46.828 --> 03:06:49.298
us without us. Is no something

03:06:49.364 --> 03:06:51.033
to put on a button or wearing a

03:06:51.099 --> 03:06:51.600
tee shirt not really. Hard

03:06:51.667 --> 03:06:53.335
content of the MHSAA and to

03:06:53.402 --> 03:06:55.270
move ahead with considerations

03:06:55.337 --> 03:06:57.406
on how to refresh this that

03:06:57.472 --> 03:07:01.009
needs to be done. Including the

03:07:01.076 --> 03:07:03.645
views of the folks at the MHSAA

03:07:03.712 --> 03:07:04.980
means the most to clients and

03:07:05.047 --> 03:07:09.084
family members- and we

03:07:09.151 --> 03:07:12.454
encourage you not doing it at a

03:07:12.521 --> 03:07:13.088
Amanda was well there are a lot

03:07:13.155 --> 03:07:13.655
of folks around the state.

03:07:13.722 --> 03:07:15.190
Although here in the capital of

03:07:15.257 --> 03:07:20.963
mine. It's hard to get here for

03:07:21.029 --> 03:07:22.998
a number of reasons- so we just

03:07:23.065 --> 03:07:23.632
only encourage that the process

03:07:23.699 --> 03:07:26.068
purposefully seeks their

03:07:26.134 --> 03:07:27.069
feedback- because this is

03:07:27.135 --> 03:07:29.204
critical to ensuring that

03:07:29.271 --> 03:07:30.872
whatever happens with the M. is

03:07:30.939 --> 03:07:33.175
done in partnership with the

03:07:33.241 --> 03:07:39.815
community it's on hand in hand

03:07:39.881 --> 03:07:40.349
with consumer and family

03:07:40.415 --> 03:07:43.218
members. Which is the engine in

03:07:43.285 --> 03:07:46.822
the hallmark of the MHSAA and-

03:07:46.888 --> 03:07:47.422
I thank you for giving me the

03:07:47.489 --> 03:07:48.023
opportunity to share with you

03:07:48.090 --> 03:07:52.894
today in. I'm available for

03:07:52.961 --> 03:07:53.495
thank you miss Brandt next we

03:07:53.562 --> 03:08:01.269
have found the car. Noon. And

03:08:01.336 --> 03:08:01.870
members of the committee thank

03:08:01.937 --> 03:08:03.005
you for having me here today.

03:08:03.071 --> 03:08:03.639
My name is Karen Vick I am the

03:08:03.705 --> 03:08:05.574
policy director for cal voices

03:08:05.641 --> 03:08:09.077
formally known as nor cal MHA.

03:08:09.144 --> 03:08:10.812
We are the oldest pure run

03:08:10.879 --> 03:08:11.279
mental health advocacy

03:08:11.346 --> 03:08:13.148
organization in California all

03:08:13.215 --> 03:08:16.918
of our sixty plus employees

03:08:16.985 --> 03:08:17.419
personally identify as

03:08:17.486 --> 03:08:21.289
consumers and or family members

03:08:21.356 --> 03:08:23.425
in addition we have thirty

03:08:23.492 --> 03:08:23.992
access ambassadors in every

03:08:24.059 --> 03:08:26.161
region of the state to provide

03:08:26.228 --> 03:08:28.630
local Casey in their counties

03:08:28.697 --> 03:08:30.899
and at the state level. And

03:08:30.966 --> 03:08:38.507
that's through our MHS so it.

03:08:38.573 --> 03:08:47.049
Did I'm access ram. I have this

03:08:47.115 --> 03:08:51.153
mental. How main points that I

03:08:51.219 --> 03:08:53.055
would like to discuss today

03:08:53.121 --> 03:08:53.622
number one- California's is

03:08:53.689 --> 03:08:55.590
truly believes that the M. HSA

03:08:55.657 --> 03:08:57.292
does not need to be changed or

03:08:57.359 --> 03:08:59.194
refreshed it's simply needs to

03:08:59.261 --> 03:09:10.972
be enforced. Number. Number two

03:09:11.039 --> 03:09:13.408
with each current can see can

03:09:13.475 --> 03:09:19.548
changes. Not mine. Is the

03:09:19.614 --> 03:09:20.182
altering the M. HSA and number

03:09:20.248 --> 03:09:22.818
three I'm going to echo Angela

03:09:22.884 --> 03:09:23.418
clients in consumers must be

03:09:23.485 --> 03:09:24.019
treated as a sexual partners

03:09:24.086 --> 03:09:31.093
and all discussions regarding

03:09:31.159 --> 03:09:34.963
proposed changes to the M. HSA.

03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.530
Out something that director

03:09:35.597 --> 03:09:37.232
eutectic point. At yeah to a

03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:39.000
lack of affordable housing not

03:09:39.067 --> 03:09:41.203
mental illness a twenty

03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:42.904
seventeen study by hood found

03:09:42.971 --> 03:09:45.006
that only 26% of homeless

03:09:45.073 --> 03:09:47.209
people nationwide live with

03:09:47.275 --> 03:09:51.079
mental illness we also know

03:09:51.146 --> 03:09:51.646
that homelessness can cause

03:09:51.713 --> 03:09:55.183
mental illness. We don't know

03:09:55.250 --> 03:10:02.824
the numbers there but we can be

03:10:02.891 --> 03:10:06.862
pretty sure. Fewer than 26% of

03:10:06.928 --> 03:10:09.097
the homeless population live at

03:10:09.164 --> 03:10:09.731
the mental yes at the time of.

03:10:09.798 --> 03:10:13.268
Yes so I that's what I've heard

03:10:13.335 --> 03:10:18.640
please don't derail MHSAA money

03:10:18.707 --> 03:10:19.274
for an affordable housing issue

03:10:19.341 --> 03:10:21.243
if seventy more than 76% of

03:10:21.309 --> 03:10:21.810
homeless people do not even

03:10:21.877 --> 03:10:27.015
have a mental illness. Comments

03:10:27.082 --> 03:10:27.616
we're we're hearing comments

03:10:27.682 --> 03:10:29.017
today about the need for

03:10:29.084 --> 03:10:29.651
statewide performance outcomes

03:10:29.718 --> 03:10:32.721
of a focus on specific

03:10:32.788 --> 03:10:34.823
populations statewide guidance

03:10:34.890 --> 03:10:38.960
on priorities for the M. HSA.

03:10:39.027 --> 03:10:39.561
To say was written and passed

03:10:39.628 --> 03:10:46.802
back in. Two thousand four. To

03:10:46.868 --> 03:10:47.402
address all of these issues.

03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:49.237
Missy. For Smith of the act.

03:10:49.304 --> 03:10:55.644
We've been hearing today all.

03:10:55.710 --> 03:11:00.916
We've. Been hearing about how

03:11:00.982 --> 03:11:08.323
successful FS PSR and his bees.

03:11:08.390 --> 03:11:08.890
Thirty one ship it is 60% in

03:11:08.957 --> 03:11:12.994
homelessness of. Emergency stop

03:11:13.061 --> 03:11:19.100
84% The images also based on

03:11:19.167 --> 03:11:19.701
the highly effective AB thirty

03:11:19.768 --> 03:11:22.003
for a beat. All which would.

03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:26.541
Posit out. And I have some code

03:11:26.608 --> 03:11:27.209
sections that that I think have

03:11:27.275 --> 03:11:33.248
been sort of- code sections of

03:11:33.315 --> 03:11:33.882
the image as say that have been

03:11:33.949 --> 03:11:41.489
sort of. Beef. Well for

03:11:41.556 --> 03:11:42.123
institutions code section fifty

03:11:42.190 --> 03:11:46.995
eight I've. The V. eight in

03:11:47.062 --> 03:11:49.664
design. The joint plan for a

03:11:49.731 --> 03:11:54.169
coordinated evaluation of

03:11:54.236 --> 03:11:59.774
client outcomes in the unity

03:11:59.841 --> 03:12:03.144
based mental health system. The

03:12:03.211 --> 03:12:03.778
California services services AT

03:12:03.845 --> 03:12:08.850
and similarly the- the section

03:12:08.917 --> 03:12:11.653
fifty eight forty C. three year

03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:14.122
plan shell clued reports on the

03:12:14.189 --> 03:12:14.723
pavement performance outcomes

03:12:14.789 --> 03:12:15.257
for services funded by the

03:12:15.323 --> 03:12:22.397
process. And established.

03:12:22.464 --> 03:12:24.866
Jointly each CS and the only

03:12:24.933 --> 03:12:26.768
see and collaborate CB a thank.

03:12:26.835 --> 03:12:27.369
And there's no more I can bore

03:12:27.435 --> 03:12:29.037
you with code sections. But I

03:12:29.104 --> 03:12:29.638
do agree upon was director you

03:12:29.704 --> 03:12:33.375
tech dot. Beat these outcomes

03:12:33.441 --> 03:12:34.009
are provided for in the M. HSA

03:12:34.075 --> 03:12:35.443
and it it needs to be something

03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:38.747
that happens outside of the act

03:12:38.813 --> 03:12:40.749
with all relevant stakeholders

03:12:40.815 --> 03:12:42.951
determining what what what is

03:12:43.018 --> 03:12:44.853
our state plan. It is provided

03:12:44.920 --> 03:12:47.055
for in the act but it doesn't

03:12:47.122 --> 03:12:47.689
need to be codified directly in

03:12:47.756 --> 03:12:52.928
the act. Eight and again it's

03:12:52.994 --> 03:12:55.263
we also agreed that that is why

03:12:55.330 --> 03:12:59.167
the act was not written with

03:12:59.234 --> 03:13:04.139
specific outcomes in it because

03:13:04.205 --> 03:13:04.739
needs change I think if what

03:13:04.806 --> 03:13:09.644
would be the sure is working

03:13:09.711 --> 03:13:10.545
great then aren't. Going to

03:13:10.612 --> 03:13:13.615
change maybe maybe we want to

03:13:13.682 --> 03:13:14.849
focus on homelessness it's been

03:13:14.916 --> 03:13:15.383
involved here after years

03:13:15.450 --> 03:13:20.488
should be set in stone. A

03:13:20.555 --> 03:13:21.089
second thing that we've heard

03:13:21.156 --> 03:13:22.757
about today. And a key piece of

03:13:22.824 --> 03:13:24.392
the image. Strict

03:13:24.459 --> 03:13:29.064
accountability funds. The.

03:13:29.130 --> 03:13:29.664
Mobile template said in your

03:13:29.731 --> 03:13:30.966
side panel independent paid

03:13:31.032 --> 03:13:31.466
members to provide his

03:13:31.533 --> 03:13:34.970
expenditures they can cut off

03:13:35.036 --> 03:13:35.570
funding for programs that are

03:13:35.637 --> 03:13:38.873
not effective. That has never

03:13:38.940 --> 03:13:39.474
been that was the promise to

03:13:39.541 --> 03:13:43.211
voters when we passed the M.

03:13:43.278 --> 03:13:45.714
HSA and it has never happened.

03:13:45.780 --> 03:13:47.315
I'm enforcement of the act has

03:13:47.382 --> 03:13:48.917
steadily declined beginning

03:13:48.984 --> 03:13:54.556
with AB one hundred and twenty

03:13:54.622 --> 03:13:57.692
seven. And again in twenty

03:13:57.759 --> 03:13:58.159
twelve wind damage got

03:13:58.226 --> 03:14:03.698
dismantled. Some from from AB

03:14:03.765 --> 03:14:04.833
one hundred which which was to

03:14:04.899 --> 03:14:07.202
build that started to take off

03:14:07.268 --> 03:14:09.104
and force minute to say. It is

03:14:09.170 --> 03:14:11.706
they they wrote this in eighty

03:14:11.773 --> 03:14:12.340
one hundred it is the intent of

03:14:12.407 --> 03:14:13.174
the legislature to insure

03:14:13.241 --> 03:14:15.510
continued state oversight and

03:14:15.577 --> 03:14:20.415
accountability of the mental

03:14:20.482 --> 03:14:27.022
services act. In eliminating.

03:14:27.088 --> 03:14:27.655
State approval of county mental

03:14:27.722 --> 03:14:28.289
health programs. Which I expect

03:14:28.356 --> 03:14:32.994
state. To establish a more if.

03:14:33.061 --> 03:14:33.595
During that. Complies with the

03:14:33.661 --> 03:14:38.333
mental health services act. And

03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:38.933
I don't hear from the little

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:46.941
Hoover commission. It it in

03:14:47.008 --> 03:14:48.977
their in their letter. Of ever

03:14:49.044 --> 03:14:51.212
in the wake of the commission

03:14:51.279 --> 03:14:53.181
second review that the state

03:14:53.248 --> 03:14:55.116
must identify a well defined

03:14:55.183 --> 03:14:58.453
leader to administer oversee

03:14:58.520 --> 03:15:01.256
and enforce the MHSAA or it

03:15:01.322 --> 03:15:01.790
will remain difficult to

03:15:01.856 --> 03:15:05.326
articulate a cohesive vision.

03:15:05.393 --> 03:15:10.532
And ensure accountability. To

03:15:10.598 --> 03:15:11.166
alleviate many of the visible

03:15:11.232 --> 03:15:11.733
statewide impacts of mental

03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:16.604
illness. And given given me the

03:15:16.671 --> 03:15:19.274
arm out but if we're in the act

03:15:19.340 --> 03:15:21.176
we really believe. The goal of

03:15:21.242 --> 03:15:23.144
the state can be accomplished

03:15:23.211 --> 03:15:24.913
without rewriting or refreshing

03:15:24.979 --> 03:15:31.119
the MHSAA. We also believe that

03:15:31.186 --> 03:15:35.890
now is not the time for

03:15:35.957 --> 03:15:38.259
significant. Changes to the M.

03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:39.794
HSA the images they have strong

03:15:39.861 --> 03:15:48.169
not sub patient provisions. It

03:15:48.236 --> 03:15:50.905
was written. To gaps in

03:15:50.972 --> 03:15:51.439
available services and to

03:15:51.506 --> 03:15:55.210
provide services. He provided.

03:15:55.276 --> 03:15:55.810
Yes is Caroline proposal which

03:15:55.877 --> 03:15:58.847
was just released. Actually it

03:15:58.913 --> 03:16:01.449
knowledges that the agency has

03:16:01.516 --> 03:16:03.218
not considered the potential

03:16:03.284 --> 03:16:03.785
impact that overhauling the

03:16:03.852 --> 03:16:11.126
entire meant tells. May have on

03:16:11.192 --> 03:16:11.659
non medical mental health

03:16:11.726 --> 03:16:15.230
program. Stake holders on the

03:16:15.296 --> 03:16:19.134
following questions what impact

03:16:19.200 --> 03:16:24.038
would a fully integrated.

03:16:24.105 --> 03:16:24.706
Medical delivery system have on

03:16:24.772 --> 03:16:29.310
on mad cow program mandates.

03:16:29.377 --> 03:16:29.944
Eight until this is act Sam's a

03:16:30.011 --> 03:16:31.546
block grants. I would also now

03:16:31.613 --> 03:16:33.248
this is the only director MHS

03:16:33.314 --> 03:16:35.683
state in the entire car. The

03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:42.924
images. Proximally 20% of

03:16:42.991 --> 03:16:43.458
county behavioral health

03:16:43.525 --> 03:16:47.529
funding. And counties apply in

03:16:47.595 --> 03:16:48.163
another portion of an HSA funds

03:16:48.229 --> 03:16:53.101
toward. Fun. The whole system

03:16:53.168 --> 03:16:55.170
proposed name and a focus on

03:16:55.236 --> 03:16:57.205
the same populations that this

03:16:57.272 --> 03:17:07.549
MHSAA refresh intends to target.

03:17:07.615 --> 03:17:08.116
We really believe that any

03:17:08.183 --> 03:17:08.716
changes to the and just speak

03:17:08.783 --> 03:17:11.286
after. So that we know where

03:17:11.352 --> 03:17:17.025
the tree. Talking about human

03:17:17.091 --> 03:17:18.860
beings who are already in

03:17:18.927 --> 03:17:20.962
treatment they're already in

03:17:21.029 --> 03:17:21.563
this piece we can't just come

03:17:21.629 --> 03:17:24.966
in. And put a whole bunch of

03:17:25.033 --> 03:17:28.636
money in P. E. I. because what

03:17:28.703 --> 03:17:29.204
happens to these real human

03:17:29.270 --> 03:17:31.105
beings- live their lives

03:17:31.172 --> 03:17:31.606
because of the effective

03:17:31.673 --> 03:17:32.106
treatments that they're

03:17:32.173 --> 03:17:43.117
receiving. And third- this

03:17:43.184 --> 03:17:47.388
must. Numbers just say as in

03:17:47.455 --> 03:17:49.224
merry drop mental health policy

03:17:49.290 --> 03:17:49.757
damage to say was ground

03:17:49.824 --> 03:17:51.926
breaking in the levels of

03:17:51.993 --> 03:17:52.560
stakeholder involvement that it

03:17:52.627 --> 03:17:53.194
requires it requires counties

03:17:53.261 --> 03:17:55.129
to demonstrate a partnership

03:17:55.196 --> 03:17:55.597
with constituents and

03:17:55.663 --> 03:17:57.665
stakeholders throughout the

03:17:57.732 --> 03:17:58.132
process that includes

03:17:58.199 --> 03:17:59.701
meaningful stakeholder

03:17:59.767 --> 03:18:04.806
involvement. Not only are. On

03:18:04.872 --> 03:18:06.908
mental health C. program.

03:18:06.975 --> 03:18:07.408
Program implementation-

03:18:07.475 --> 03:18:09.244
monitoring quality improvement

03:18:09.310 --> 03:18:09.711
evaluation and budget

03:18:09.777 --> 03:18:15.550
allocations. And I will say.

03:18:15.617 --> 03:18:16.184
Any processes are happening in

03:18:16.251 --> 03:18:16.784
the counties but consumers are

03:18:16.851 --> 03:18:18.920
not involved in all of these

03:18:18.987 --> 03:18:19.554
elements this is another this

03:18:19.621 --> 03:18:25.126
is another of enforcement. If

03:18:25.193 --> 03:18:29.330
this in for we have at the

03:18:29.397 --> 03:18:32.967
county level I'm going. All the-

03:18:33.034 --> 03:18:33.601
being able to say Hey this is

03:18:33.668 --> 03:18:35.203
working in our local community

03:18:35.270 --> 03:18:38.806
this is not working. I'm

03:18:38.873 --> 03:18:39.440
Clinton consumers are the stake

03:18:39.507 --> 03:18:42.477
holders for stake holders who

03:18:42.543 --> 03:18:44.946
are the most significantly.

03:18:45.013 --> 03:18:47.048
Acted by any changes to the

03:18:47.115 --> 03:18:48.983
public and a whole system you

03:18:49.050 --> 03:18:49.550
must be AT. And meaningfully

03:18:49.617 --> 03:18:55.089
involved. So we ask that the

03:18:55.156 --> 03:18:55.723
legislature do its part to ink

03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:56.257
clued consumers and other

03:18:56.324 --> 03:18:58.126
stakeholders in any discussions

03:18:58.192 --> 03:19:03.431
regarding proposed updates or

03:19:03.498 --> 03:19:06.834
revisions to the MHSAA. I'm and

03:19:06.901 --> 03:19:07.435
we also beg you please ensure

03:19:07.502 --> 03:19:17.345
the I'm- oriented ankle driven.

03:19:17.412 --> 03:19:18.813
And that strict enforcement

03:19:18.880 --> 03:19:21.215
mechanisms are created thank

03:19:21.282 --> 03:19:27.322
you much thank you. I will

03:19:27.388 --> 03:19:27.822
comments brief for this

03:19:27.889 --> 03:19:28.823
analysts we will wants to focus

03:19:28.890 --> 03:19:30.958
on calling him as well- but did

03:19:31.025 --> 03:19:31.559
want to thank both cal voices

03:19:31.626 --> 03:19:33.127
and nominee for we were very

03:19:33.194 --> 03:19:35.263
intentional and making sure

03:19:35.330 --> 03:19:37.098
that the discussion would not

03:19:37.165 --> 03:19:39.100
be complete without making it

03:19:39.167 --> 03:19:41.135
very numbers are. Present as

03:19:41.202 --> 03:19:46.774
well- and in that light I

03:19:46.841 --> 03:19:50.745
actually. Plan on being two our

03:19:50.812 --> 03:19:51.379
December sixteenth hearing that

03:19:51.446 --> 03:19:57.418
from the county is. Yeah each

03:19:57.485 --> 03:19:58.820
all the center common area

03:19:58.886 --> 03:20:06.961
where they are doing dedicated

03:20:07.028 --> 03:20:07.595
out reach towards a culturally

03:20:07.662 --> 03:20:08.229
and linguistically part of our

03:20:08.296 --> 03:20:11.399
relation that struggles. To

03:20:11.466 --> 03:20:11.999
receive says. But I do think

03:20:12.066 --> 03:20:14.936
there. I will be with you

03:20:15.002 --> 03:20:15.470
director detected does not

03:20:15.536 --> 03:20:17.038
appear that we have a lack of.

03:20:17.105 --> 03:20:18.973
But a lack of. Fighting why did

03:20:19.040 --> 03:20:19.574
inefficient manner so we can

03:20:19.640 --> 03:20:21.209
digest it and help to make

03:20:21.275 --> 03:20:23.077
informed decisions is the goal

03:20:23.144 --> 03:20:27.582
of what I'm trying to bring to

03:20:27.648 --> 03:20:32.620
the conversation and so I

03:20:32.687 --> 03:20:33.254
looked towards working with go

03:20:33.321 --> 03:20:37.692
exceed of figure. Out there are

03:20:37.759 --> 03:20:38.292
additional resources that may

03:20:38.359 --> 03:20:38.860
be needed or we can. Convert

03:20:38.926 --> 03:20:45.233
ten. Trace in about proving.

03:20:45.299 --> 03:20:45.833
With that I will thank this

03:20:45.900 --> 03:20:46.834
panel for coming forward and

03:20:46.901 --> 03:20:47.435
invite up the fourth panel on

03:20:47.502 --> 03:21:05.686
callin

03:21:13.027 --> 03:21:14.762
. Thank you we will.

03:21:14.829 --> 03:21:15.329
Begin with our chief Brenda

03:21:15.396 --> 03:21:19.133
greatly. Good afternoon I'll

03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:21.002
Brenda great was chief of the

03:21:21.068 --> 03:21:23.871
medic how the new medical

03:21:23.938 --> 03:21:24.505
behavioral health division at

03:21:24.572 --> 03:21:32.113
the California department of

03:21:32.180 --> 03:21:32.780
health care services just one I

03:21:32.847 --> 03:21:34.749
think a committee. For inviting

03:21:34.816 --> 03:21:35.349
us to come here today to speak

03:21:35.416 --> 03:21:41.088
about cal. And you know just

03:21:41.155 --> 03:21:41.689
even sitting here throughout

03:21:41.756 --> 03:21:43.157
the afternoon- it's been great

03:21:43.224 --> 03:21:45.126
just to hear the comments and

03:21:45.193 --> 03:21:47.094
really the thinking that's

03:21:47.161 --> 03:21:49.030
going on- about how killing

03:21:49.096 --> 03:21:51.566
can. Are really helps

03:21:51.632 --> 03:21:56.471
strengthen our delivery systems

03:21:56.537 --> 03:21:57.071
because out based intent. I'm

03:21:57.138 --> 03:22:03.244
so essentially- with cal aim

03:22:03.311 --> 03:22:04.745
the over arching goals. Add to-

03:22:04.812 --> 03:22:05.213
somewhat so you're an

03:22:05.279 --> 03:22:07.114
initiative up through the

03:22:07.181 --> 03:22:08.850
quality of life. Things are

03:22:08.916 --> 03:22:11.152
beneficiaries- through the

03:22:11.219 --> 03:22:12.753
implementation of broad

03:22:12.820 --> 03:22:15.022
delivery system programs and

03:22:15.089 --> 03:22:15.623
payment reforms across other

03:22:15.690 --> 03:22:17.391
medical program and essentially

03:22:17.458 --> 03:22:20.761
we're looking to- manage member

03:22:20.828 --> 03:22:21.329
risk through a whole person

03:22:21.395 --> 03:22:23.030
care approaches to really

03:22:23.097 --> 03:22:23.564
thinking broadly about the

03:22:23.631 --> 03:22:30.905
needs of individuals- and then.

03:22:30.972 --> 03:22:33.975
Also considering- how best to

03:22:34.041 --> 03:22:34.609
address social science of. Also

03:22:34.675 --> 03:22:38.779
look stern and seamless system-

03:22:38.846 --> 03:22:41.082
by reducing the car accident

03:22:41.148 --> 03:22:43.050
increasing flexibility it's not

03:22:43.117 --> 03:22:45.186
always the easiest systems and

03:22:45.253 --> 03:22:47.088
systems to navigate- looking at

03:22:47.154 --> 03:22:49.123
how we can better strengthen

03:22:49.190 --> 03:22:49.690
those processes to improve

03:22:49.757 --> 03:22:52.460
access- and then also improving

03:22:52.527 --> 03:22:56.597
quality outcomes which I know

03:22:56.664 --> 03:22:59.634
it's just- our discussion- in

03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:00.301
the last- up and doing. Through

03:23:00.368 --> 03:23:04.505
value based initiative as mark.

03:23:04.572 --> 03:23:05.006
Our system producer data

03:23:05.072 --> 03:23:11.412
systems it came in. I'm so

03:23:11.479 --> 03:23:12.046
we're looking to do all of this

03:23:12.113 --> 03:23:16.984
in the coming months. Hey y'all

03:23:17.051 --> 03:23:17.585
farms under workers for the-

03:23:17.652 --> 03:23:20.955
which will be kicked. Number so

03:23:21.022 --> 03:23:21.589
just a little plug that we- are

03:23:21.656 --> 03:23:22.990
continue how these work groups

03:23:23.057 --> 03:23:24.825
in anybody's- public's welcome

03:23:24.892 --> 03:23:25.426
to attend listen and provide

03:23:25.493 --> 03:23:27.828
feedback you throughout the

03:23:27.895 --> 03:23:28.462
work groups or even after the

03:23:28.529 --> 03:23:30.164
work groups and we accept a

03:23:30.231 --> 03:23:30.798
written comment as well folks I

03:23:30.865 --> 03:23:36.571
thought as I for today I'm so

03:23:36.637 --> 03:23:40.775
are in kind of going over. The

03:23:40.841 --> 03:23:41.242
diff. Souls related to

03:23:41.309 --> 03:23:42.910
behavioral health. Of the

03:23:42.977 --> 03:23:43.444
foundation is our best of

03:23:43.511 --> 03:23:45.146
payment. And former looking to

03:23:45.212 --> 03:23:47.214
incentivize outcomes and

03:23:47.281 --> 03:23:48.950
quality over volume and cost

03:23:49.016 --> 03:23:52.286
right now I we have as a C. P.

03:23:52.353 --> 03:23:53.120
E. or certified public

03:23:53.187 --> 03:23:55.356
expenditure process and we're

03:23:55.423 --> 03:23:55.957
looking to move away from that

03:23:56.023 --> 03:24:01.362
to watch. Where I'm vestments

03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:03.798
can be made the deliveries

03:24:03.864 --> 03:24:04.298
with. Mental health and

03:24:04.365 --> 03:24:04.899
substance use delivery systems

03:24:04.966 --> 03:24:08.836
I'm still. In a clip our county

03:24:08.903 --> 03:24:11.105
partners all as well through

03:24:11.172 --> 03:24:15.576
our stakeholder groups to do

03:24:15.643 --> 03:24:16.210
this- Wanamaker we thought for.

03:24:16.277 --> 03:24:23.050
Want to disrupt services. If

03:24:23.117 --> 03:24:24.952
the current up finding out of

03:24:25.019 --> 03:24:29.624
our system so doing a manner.

03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:31.192
And are really like said this

03:24:31.258 --> 03:24:33.894
the foundation of so many of

03:24:33.961 --> 03:24:34.495
the proposals on which I'll go

03:24:34.562 --> 03:24:35.296
over about things like. Ten

03:24:35.363 --> 03:24:37.331
then all. Trying to other word

03:24:37.398 --> 03:24:42.403
we're working on it and-

03:24:42.470 --> 03:24:45.172
building a robust. Continuum of

03:24:45.239 --> 03:24:47.308
care. So and then another

03:24:47.375 --> 03:24:50.511
benefit. Describe a supporting

03:24:50.578 --> 03:24:51.045
better coordination with

03:24:51.112 --> 03:24:54.015
physical hall so I know there's

03:24:54.081 --> 03:24:54.615
been a question of the I for

03:24:54.682 --> 03:24:57.284
cations in- the managed care

03:24:57.351 --> 03:24:59.587
plans in mental health plans

03:24:59.654 --> 03:25:00.121
because the benefit split

03:25:00.187 --> 03:25:03.958
between the two deliveries. Do

03:25:04.025 --> 03:25:04.558
the US address that through a

03:25:04.625 --> 03:25:09.764
financing and care.

03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:12.900
Coordination approaches.

03:25:12.967 --> 03:25:19.073
Medical moving. On both my

03:25:19.140 --> 03:25:19.640
health and substance use to

03:25:19.707 --> 03:25:21.242
order our delivery systems-

03:25:21.308 --> 03:25:22.943
currently the current

03:25:23.010 --> 03:25:25.680
definitions outdated it's

03:25:25.746 --> 03:25:27.148
confusing- it's really a good

03:25:27.214 --> 03:25:33.154
talking to Rio remember examine

03:25:33.220 --> 03:25:39.326
that- and. So you in doing so.

03:25:39.393 --> 03:25:41.595
We're hoping to provide clarity

03:25:41.662 --> 03:25:44.832
and boy does allowances- and-

03:25:44.899 --> 03:25:49.303
the service. As well we're also

03:25:49.370 --> 03:25:50.805
looking at looking at a help

03:25:50.871 --> 03:25:51.305
cleaning can be done for

03:25:51.372 --> 03:25:53.040
services before diagnoses are

03:25:53.107 --> 03:25:53.607
made because that's another

03:25:53.674 --> 03:25:55.142
area of confusion which I think

03:25:55.209 --> 03:25:55.743
director you'll take mentioned

03:25:55.810 --> 03:25:58.879
as well we are also looking at

03:25:58.946 --> 03:25:59.346
our behavior hauled

03:25:59.413 --> 03:26:01.082
administrative an integration

03:26:01.148 --> 03:26:03.084
so- there's two types of

03:26:03.150 --> 03:26:06.487
integration. When we talk about

03:26:06.554 --> 03:26:07.054
this there's the behavioral

03:26:07.121 --> 03:26:07.855
health which is mental health

03:26:07.922 --> 03:26:08.422
and substance use disorder

03:26:08.489 --> 03:26:10.825
services and then that's one.

03:26:10.891 --> 03:26:18.566
Out that we're looking at. And

03:26:18.632 --> 03:26:19.100
I think early. On was the

03:26:19.166 --> 03:26:19.767
foreign aggression. Plans which

03:26:19.834 --> 03:26:23.137
is I. integration within manage

03:26:23.204 --> 03:26:23.671
care which are are some a

03:26:23.738 --> 03:26:25.172
separate track. The mental

03:26:25.239 --> 03:26:27.108
health and substance use

03:26:27.174 --> 03:26:28.976
disorder integration our boat

03:26:29.043 --> 03:26:31.011
to- improve efficiencies and

03:26:31.078 --> 03:26:36.951
access for beneficiaries. To be

03:26:37.017 --> 03:26:40.054
able to- have an easier time

03:26:40.121 --> 03:26:49.363
with screening. So that they're

03:26:49.430 --> 03:26:49.997
not necessary so the clinicians

03:26:50.064 --> 03:26:52.967
can can be able to do the.

03:26:53.033 --> 03:26:55.369
Right now to accept delivery

03:26:55.436 --> 03:26:58.939
system and so some overlap some

03:26:59.006 --> 03:27:01.142
that do not- so it's almost a

03:27:01.208 --> 03:27:02.710
double duty- same thing with-

03:27:02.777 --> 03:27:05.713
benefits to the system level we

03:27:05.780 --> 03:27:08.616
have a separate. Records are no

03:27:08.682 --> 03:27:12.820
health record since use decide

03:27:12.887 --> 03:27:13.387
assigned the source of the

03:27:13.454 --> 03:27:15.122
whole some of the news with

03:27:15.189 --> 03:27:20.895
Europe. On a call you

03:27:20.961 --> 03:27:21.428
organizations to separate

03:27:21.495 --> 03:27:22.062
reviews- and then also with our

03:27:22.129 --> 03:27:22.930
compliance reviews two separate

03:27:22.997 --> 03:27:26.934
reviews so looking to see how

03:27:27.001 --> 03:27:27.535
we might be able to streamline

03:27:27.601 --> 03:27:29.236
the process. I'm sure. You also

03:27:29.303 --> 03:27:34.909
get. More view of the system. I

03:27:34.975 --> 03:27:43.784
in addition with regional I'm

03:27:43.851 --> 03:27:44.418
trying- some of the county is-

03:27:44.485 --> 03:27:45.085
are particularly rural counties

03:27:45.152 --> 03:27:45.586
but other counties wall

03:27:45.653 --> 03:27:50.558
struggle with- getting access

03:27:50.624 --> 03:27:51.091
to providers as we talked

03:27:51.158 --> 03:27:53.160
about. Or even using these

03:27:53.227 --> 03:27:55.229
administrator. Be able to

03:27:55.296 --> 03:28:01.001
leverage. I approve of is it.

03:28:01.068 --> 03:28:01.602
My is the resources the noble

03:28:01.669 --> 03:28:05.005
for these counties. The dish

03:28:05.072 --> 03:28:08.876
are we have another- effort

03:28:08.943 --> 03:28:09.410
proposal on- the seriously

03:28:09.476 --> 03:28:11.245
mensal misters mental illness

03:28:11.312 --> 03:28:12.880
stirs emotional disturbance I

03:28:12.947 --> 03:28:13.514
am D. institutions for mental

03:28:13.581 --> 03:28:15.015
diseases waiver which was

03:28:15.082 --> 03:28:15.549
talked about a little bit

03:28:15.616 --> 03:28:18.953
earlier today shop and so

03:28:19.019 --> 03:28:21.055
we're- focusing workgroups on

03:28:21.121 --> 03:28:21.655
that route workgroup meetings

03:28:21.722 --> 03:28:23.190
on this. A demonstration

03:28:23.257 --> 03:28:25.059
opportunity that's- available

03:28:25.125 --> 03:28:27.094
through the centers for

03:28:27.161 --> 03:28:30.030
Medicare Medicaid services-

03:28:30.097 --> 03:28:31.999
it's an opt in so we need to

03:28:32.066 --> 03:28:35.536
decide or through go through a

03:28:35.603 --> 03:28:36.136
stakeholder process to decide

03:28:36.203 --> 03:28:38.839
whether or not to. Apply

03:28:38.906 --> 03:28:39.373
there's a lot of. Things

03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:42.776
involved so one of our first.

03:28:42.843 --> 03:28:45.179
Making sure that it. Is working

03:28:45.246 --> 03:28:45.813
on this for thinking about this

03:28:45.880 --> 03:28:47.047
is aware of all those

03:28:47.114 --> 03:28:47.648
requirements I was really to

03:28:47.715 --> 03:28:49.416
build out a continuum of care

03:28:49.483 --> 03:28:51.385
and- if the decision or the

03:28:51.452 --> 03:28:53.120
recommendation is made to apply

03:28:53.187 --> 03:28:53.687
for this waiver then what

03:28:53.754 --> 03:28:55.189
considerations does the state

03:28:55.256 --> 03:28:59.026
need to make when developing

03:28:59.093 --> 03:29:00.895
the application to us the

03:29:00.961 --> 03:29:03.330
amounts. And then in addition

03:29:03.397 --> 03:29:06.066
to four look into- for

03:29:06.133 --> 03:29:07.034
substance use disorder or drug

03:29:07.101 --> 03:29:14.508
medi cal organized delivery

03:29:14.575 --> 03:29:15.075
system- roll that into the

03:29:15.142 --> 03:29:18.879
nineteen. The waiver process

03:29:18.946 --> 03:29:21.348
with the exception of the

03:29:21.415 --> 03:29:21.949
residential piece when I'm in

03:29:22.016 --> 03:29:24.952
in that. I improvements to be

03:29:25.019 --> 03:29:26.921
current- special terms and

03:29:26.987 --> 03:29:28.923
conditions for a DMC ODS

03:29:28.989 --> 03:29:35.496
waiver- through lessons learned

03:29:35.562 --> 03:29:36.130
these things that we've learned

03:29:36.196 --> 03:29:43.871
as we've implemented- the ODS

03:29:43.938 --> 03:29:44.405
and several counties with

03:29:44.471 --> 03:29:47.107
thirty. I'm so we. I'm take a

03:29:47.174 --> 03:29:52.846
comprehensive approach- many is

03:29:52.913 --> 03:29:53.414
element arm I've met and are

03:29:53.480 --> 03:29:59.420
part of a. And so that folks

03:29:59.486 --> 03:30:01.488
could access the system in an

03:30:01.555 --> 03:30:02.923
appropriate way. I'm in

03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:07.728
addition to cal in which is a

03:30:07.795 --> 03:30:10.864
huge undertaking. And we've

03:30:10.931 --> 03:30:19.506
also got sent several things

03:30:19.573 --> 03:30:20.174
it's been blank walls- help at

03:30:20.240 --> 03:30:21.976
this stage- you know with the-

03:30:22.042 --> 03:30:25.079
implementation of the

03:30:25.145 --> 03:30:26.880
affordable Care Act. Hi the it

03:30:26.947 --> 03:30:29.116
up. Have a random you're

03:30:29.183 --> 03:30:31.785
standing one another too odd

03:30:31.852 --> 03:30:32.353
for care coordination- we've

03:30:32.419 --> 03:30:33.454
also- through other efforts we

03:30:33.520 --> 03:30:35.356
have and other requirements

03:30:35.422 --> 03:30:40.461
we've developed a dash or so

03:30:40.527 --> 03:30:41.095
we're putting out data it's a

03:30:41.161 --> 03:30:44.198
it's a nice. Foundation. We're

03:30:44.264 --> 03:30:46.867
growing it form to incorporate

03:30:46.934 --> 03:30:47.468
additional data I'm going to

03:30:47.534 --> 03:30:50.904
expand it qual. I do look at a

03:30:50.971 --> 03:30:53.474
different are elements between-

03:30:53.540 --> 03:30:55.342
the managed care system animal

03:30:55.409 --> 03:30:57.077
house system- so it'll include

03:30:57.144 --> 03:30:59.213
things- I'll just give a couple

03:30:59.279 --> 03:31:01.215
examples but I guess- adherence

03:31:01.281 --> 03:31:03.283
to antipsychotic medications

03:31:03.350 --> 03:31:03.751
for individuals with

03:31:03.817 --> 03:31:05.219
schizophrenia or diabetes and

03:31:05.285 --> 03:31:07.888
cardiovascular disease

03:31:07.955 --> 03:31:09.123
screening so just a couple of.

03:31:09.189 --> 03:31:10.858
Course that measures that will

03:31:10.924 --> 03:31:11.458
be incorporating. Also been

03:31:11.525 --> 03:31:13.394
working for quite a few years

03:31:13.460 --> 03:31:15.496
on- implementing the managed

03:31:15.562 --> 03:31:21.168
care final rule- so we've

03:31:21.235 --> 03:31:21.802
implemented a network adequacy

03:31:21.869 --> 03:31:26.140
standards and monitoring and

03:31:26.206 --> 03:31:26.707
mental health parity through

03:31:26.774 --> 03:31:27.207
that. Effort hello. The

03:31:27.274 --> 03:31:29.476
strategy for quality in our

03:31:29.543 --> 03:31:29.943
department so- that's

03:31:30.010 --> 03:31:30.878
throughout the whole depart.

03:31:30.944 --> 03:31:33.147
Behavioral health- but it's a

03:31:33.213 --> 03:31:33.680
comprehensive approach to

03:31:33.747 --> 03:31:35.082
looking at quality. And then

03:31:35.149 --> 03:31:37.017
most recently as I mentioned we

03:31:37.084 --> 03:31:40.020
just establish a medical

03:31:40.087 --> 03:31:40.654
behavioral health division but

03:31:40.721 --> 03:31:43.490
always underwent are a

03:31:43.557 --> 03:31:44.024
reorganization within the

03:31:44.091 --> 03:31:51.398
department and- we're hoping-

03:31:51.465 --> 03:31:52.866
that the goal of. This to a

03:31:52.933 --> 03:31:56.870
federal law in the north. Some

03:31:56.937 --> 03:31:57.471
one keep tape since he's with

03:31:57.538 --> 03:31:58.972

breaking mental health and

03:31:59.606 --> 03:32:01.375
substance use disorder services

03:32:01.442 --> 03:32:03.243
even closer together within our

03:32:03.310 --> 03:32:05.212
own department which will

03:32:05.279 --> 03:32:06.947
hopefully a nice foundation for

03:32:07.014 --> 03:32:07.514
the work that will be doing

03:32:07.581 --> 03:32:09.183

03:32:09.249 --> 03:32:12.519
stakeholders- through

03:32:12.586 --> 03:32:18.725

before- you know humans are not

03:34:25.886 --> 03:34:47.808
static eating. Right would come

03:34:47.874 --> 03:34:49.142
in and as as a

03:34:51.144 --> 03:34:51.411
. On the physical

03:35:01.822 --> 03:35:10.097
risk and why. Pourtant will not

03:35:10.163 --> 03:35:10.697
just because you know you get

03:35:10.764 --> 03:35:11.265

to the federal government one

03:35:21.074 --> 03:35:21.642
of the things we started to ask

03:35:21.708 --> 03:35:22.976
is can you be a real health is

03:35:23.043 --> 03:35:25.012
how much of this is a function

03:35:25.078 --> 03:35:27.481
of federal requirements on us

03:35:27.547 --> 03:35:34.655
and how much of it is a

03:35:34.721 --> 03:35:36.923
function. Of our own doing in

03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:39.226
other words what of this comes

03:35:39.293 --> 03:35:39.860
from state. Law this comes from

03:35:39.926 --> 03:35:45.032
federal law. To I'm AT fulfill

03:35:45.098 --> 03:35:46.900

And I'll give you one quick

03:36:07.487 --> 03:36:07.988
example kind of a cross over

03:36:08.055 --> 03:36:13.327
with. Two children who were

03:36:13.393 --> 03:36:18.031
very early on in in the stages

03:36:18.098 --> 03:36:18.832
of their mental illness. And so

03:36:18.899 --> 03:36:21.234
as a result they adjusted and

03:36:21.301 --> 03:36:25.038
they got creative that. Stops

03:36:25.105 --> 03:36:27.207
third serving those children

03:36:27.274 --> 03:36:29.209
they issued. All of their

03:36:29.276 --> 03:36:31.345
provider and it you know here

03:36:31.411 --> 03:36:33.180
henceforth rather than bill

03:36:33.246 --> 03:36:35.148
medic health for the services

03:36:35.215 --> 03:36:37.117
you will use this P. E. I.

03:36:37.184 --> 03:36:39.252
dollars when kids meet these

03:36:39.319 --> 03:36:41.054
you know conditions that we got

03:36:41.121 --> 03:36:43.156
this allowances around well

03:36:43.223 --> 03:36:45.192
other counties are. Getting the

03:36:45.258 --> 03:36:50.497
same services using a medic

03:36:50.564 --> 03:36:51.064
Holland get it drying down

03:36:51.131 --> 03:36:53.133
federal financial participation

03:36:53.200 --> 03:36:54.768
this is this is not the state.

03:36:54.835 --> 03:36:57.304
Offering we should have a

03:36:57.371 --> 03:37:01.174
consistent set of rules around

03:37:01.241 --> 03:37:03.143
you know who we're serving and

03:37:03.210 --> 03:37:10.884
who were not and try. To my

03:37:10.951 --> 03:37:15.889
seeing- the federal financial

03:37:15.956 --> 03:37:22.095
participation as. It's the

03:37:22.162 --> 03:37:22.662
federal man the federal law

03:37:22.729 --> 03:37:23.263
requires that we try. Well as

03:37:23.330 --> 03:37:27.134
possible so. This and provide

03:37:27.200 --> 03:37:27.734
that care since making sure.

03:37:27.801 --> 03:37:29.269
You're playing images eight in

03:37:29.336 --> 03:37:29.836
terms of payment or form I

03:37:29.903 --> 03:37:31.338
couldn't agree with more with

03:37:31.405 --> 03:37:33.540
what Brenda said it really is

03:37:33.607 --> 03:37:35.075
the backbone of delivery system

03:37:35.142 --> 03:37:44.084
transformation for counties and

03:37:44.151 --> 03:37:45.218
again this is another place.

03:37:45.285 --> 03:37:47.220
Where we have a very- Byzantine

03:37:47.287 --> 03:37:51.158
date. Meant system it requires

03:37:51.224 --> 03:37:51.792
are per. Il to the minute I can

03:37:51.858 --> 03:37:52.426
imagine that. And it's one of

03:37:52.492 --> 03:37:53.260
the issues that that's

03:37:53.326 --> 03:37:55.128
impacting our ability to retain

03:37:55.195 --> 03:37:57.097
qualified workforce- we hear

03:37:57.164 --> 03:37:59.099
routinely from county

03:37:59.166 --> 03:38:01.101
directors. Folks are are

03:38:01.168 --> 03:38:02.836
leaving there's they're talking

03:38:02.903 --> 03:38:04.838
with their boots because they

03:38:04.905 --> 03:38:07.641
don't they they really just

03:38:07.707 --> 03:38:10.644
can't deal with the amount of

03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:11.211
documentation they have to

03:38:11.278 --> 03:38:15.749
provide and then with this if

03:38:15.816 --> 03:38:16.349
it risks. If you don't do it

03:38:16.416 --> 03:38:18.952
right it's dissolved out. Looks

03:38:19.019 --> 03:38:20.854
bad for the state and for cap.

03:38:20.921 --> 03:38:23.156
Being from a C. P. S. certified

03:38:23.223 --> 03:38:24.925
public expenditure based

03:38:24.991 --> 03:38:27.527
reimbursement system which by

03:38:27.594 --> 03:38:28.195
federal law does require a very

03:38:28.261 --> 03:38:30.096
high scrutiny the high bar

03:38:30.163 --> 03:38:34.100
standard of documentation. To

03:38:34.167 --> 03:38:37.704
an inter governmental answer-

03:38:37.771 --> 03:38:44.478
will be is significant in that

03:38:44.544 --> 03:38:45.011
it will. Still be fee for

03:38:45.078 --> 03:38:47.280
service so we're not sort of a

03:38:47.347 --> 03:38:48.882
radical sh. But it will I was.

03:38:48.949 --> 03:38:51.084
The terms of the documentation.

03:38:51.151 --> 03:38:53.420
And it'll allow us to do more

03:38:53.487 --> 03:38:53.954
to invest in quality- an

03:38:54.020 --> 03:38:54.988
improving the delivery system

03:38:55.055 --> 03:38:58.925
for our provide a we see it is

03:38:58.992 --> 03:39:05.565
a really nice next step that

03:39:05.632 --> 03:39:06.132
can move us on the road to

03:39:06.199 --> 03:39:15.509
getting to- of a value. Based

03:39:15.575 --> 03:39:22.215
system. So really. I'm I'm set

03:39:22.282 --> 03:39:23.083
at the end do you eyes. Earlier

03:39:23.149 --> 03:39:26.419
much more just to say that we

03:39:26.486 --> 03:39:27.153
do believe that it is in this

03:39:27.220 --> 03:39:32.959
picture and that we can

03:39:33.026 --> 03:39:33.627
hopefully. Bring again bring in

03:39:33.693 --> 03:39:35.128
more federal dollars but it

03:39:35.195 --> 03:39:36.997
time build out back base for

03:39:37.063 --> 03:39:38.865
structure. That we- one align

03:39:38.932 --> 03:39:41.701
incentives better there-

03:39:41.768 --> 03:39:50.143
enhance care managed and in

03:39:50.210 --> 03:39:50.644
lieu of services are the

03:39:50.710 --> 03:39:54.848
state's vision for how he. To

03:39:54.915 --> 03:39:55.448
replace what we did under the

03:39:55.515 --> 03:39:57.050
cap based. And it's a pretty

03:39:57.117 --> 03:39:59.052
big shift I do want to call out

03:39:59.119 --> 03:39:59.586
one thing the in lieu of

03:39:59.653 --> 03:40:02.822
services is- an option for

03:40:02.889 --> 03:40:05.158
states that comes out of the

03:40:05.225 --> 03:40:07.127
final rule and so it's- tied

03:40:07.193 --> 03:40:08.929
it's in federal law- it

03:40:08.995 --> 03:40:13.433
requires capitation and since

03:40:13.500 --> 03:40:15.068
we're not a capitated entity we

03:40:15.135 --> 03:40:17.771
would participate in in lieu of

03:40:17.837 --> 03:40:21.975
services. Who ship managed care

03:40:22.042 --> 03:40:29.082
plan- and then stick. Them

03:40:29.149 --> 03:40:29.683
enhanced care management which

03:40:29.749 --> 03:40:31.084
is- of trip out back capacity

03:40:31.151 --> 03:40:33.086
within medic how many care to

03:40:33.153 --> 03:40:35.121
do. Thank search court before

03:40:35.188 --> 03:40:37.290
opportunities for us to build

03:40:37.357 --> 03:40:40.093
stronger partnerships with

03:40:40.160 --> 03:40:40.727
medic how managed care through

03:40:40.794 --> 03:40:48.368
these initiatives. But with

03:40:48.435 --> 03:40:49.002
some important caveats first of

03:40:49.069 --> 03:40:51.004
all I'm the that. In my are the

03:40:51.071 --> 03:40:51.605
managed care plan brown how.

03:40:51.671 --> 03:40:55.108
All up rams flows from a

03:40:55.175 --> 03:40:57.110
population health management

03:40:57.177 --> 03:41:11.725
plan that they have to put

03:41:11.791 --> 03:41:14.794
together and. Kudos to DH CS

03:41:14.861 --> 03:41:15.395
for putting that on the table

03:41:15.462 --> 03:41:15.962
because it's really moving a

03:41:16.029 --> 03:41:18.932
proper. And we're all right.

03:41:18.999 --> 03:41:21.067
Your physical health to engage

03:41:21.134 --> 03:41:23.203
in services because don't

03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:25.038
typically just show up at the

03:41:25.105 --> 03:41:26.840
primary care clinic or when

03:41:26.906 --> 03:41:28.808
they are in the emergency

03:41:28.875 --> 03:41:31.111
department they quickly want to

03:41:31.177 --> 03:41:31.645
divert them or move them

03:41:31.711 --> 03:41:34.881
somewhere else you know it's

03:41:34.948 --> 03:41:35.548
been a little bit of a struggle

03:41:35.615 --> 03:41:37.150
to get folks into physical

03:41:37.217 --> 03:41:38.985
health care and we see that

03:41:39.052 --> 03:41:40.920
struggle reflected in their

03:41:40.987 --> 03:41:42.889
physical health outcomes being

03:41:42.956 --> 03:41:43.490
the primary drivers of early

03:41:43.556 --> 03:41:45.225
preventable deaths for our

03:41:45.291 --> 03:41:50.030
clients right. And so we

03:41:50.096 --> 03:41:54.434
believe strongly that the medic

03:41:54.501 --> 03:41:55.001
how managed care plan should

03:41:55.068 --> 03:41:57.170
require. Work with and their

03:41:57.237 --> 03:41:57.737
population help manage and-

03:41:57.804 --> 03:42:01.107
because or to work with our

03:42:01.174 --> 03:42:05.078
clients and there does need to

03:42:05.145 --> 03:42:09.816
be better collaboration beyond

03:42:09.883 --> 03:42:10.884
what's already in the ammo. Use

03:42:10.950 --> 03:42:13.553
we need to develop much

03:42:13.620 --> 03:42:14.120
stronger data sharing it it

03:42:14.187 --> 03:42:16.823
will require. Investment I

03:42:16.890 --> 03:42:17.390
think aligning our payment

03:42:17.457 --> 03:42:19.125
methodology for two out of the

03:42:19.192 --> 03:42:21.127
rest of the health world works

03:42:21.194 --> 03:42:23.063
will help facilitate some of

03:42:23.129 --> 03:42:25.031
that change and transformation

03:42:25.098 --> 03:42:27.067
but I'm to my earlier comments

03:42:27.133 --> 03:42:28.935
so much of the social

03:42:29.002 --> 03:42:29.469
determinants work and the

03:42:29.536 --> 03:42:31.204
public health work that were

03:42:31.271 --> 03:42:33.173
already doing is Connie

03:42:33.239 --> 03:42:35.008
behavioral health. Is actually

03:42:35.075 --> 03:42:38.878
not going to be captured in the

03:42:38.945 --> 03:42:42.015
context of- cal aim even

03:42:42.082 --> 03:42:47.120
through the wonderful as that

03:42:47.187 --> 03:42:47.754
we're gonna be making on these

03:42:47.821 --> 03:42:48.321
other pieces within managed

03:42:48.388 --> 03:42:52.459
care- so it's important that we

03:42:52.525 --> 03:42:53.026
understand those things and

03:42:53.093 --> 03:43:05.105
it's also. And they were. Under.

03:43:05.171 --> 03:43:07.073
Do is the behavior of. Much of

03:43:07.140 --> 03:43:09.142
anywhere else and to the hall

03:43:09.209 --> 03:43:10.777
the behavioral health space is

03:43:10.844 --> 03:43:11.344
so different from physical

03:43:11.411 --> 03:43:15.315
health in terms of what you can

03:43:15.381 --> 03:43:15.949
go out in the open market and

03:43:16.015 --> 03:43:17.350
just purchased and bring into

03:43:17.417 --> 03:43:24.858
network so we think that yes we

03:43:24.924 --> 03:43:26.359
should look. At ways that we

03:43:26.426 --> 03:43:29.262
can really add some support

03:43:29.329 --> 03:43:30.830
find the full two great pilot.

03:43:30.897 --> 03:43:33.299
Great between Inland Empire

03:43:33.366 --> 03:43:35.101
health plan and San Bernardino

03:43:35.168 --> 03:43:37.070
county there's some amazing

03:43:37.137 --> 03:43:39.105
clinical level integration work

03:43:39.172 --> 03:43:39.672
happening in riverside for

03:43:39.739 --> 03:43:41.241
example we want to figure out

03:43:41.307 --> 03:43:42.909
ways that we can spur these

03:43:42.976 --> 03:43:45.979
innovations and keep them going

03:43:46.045 --> 03:43:50.116
but to think that- managed care

03:43:50.183 --> 03:43:50.717
plans is going to go out be

03:43:50.784 --> 03:43:51.351
able to go out. I off the shelf

03:43:51.417 --> 03:43:54.821
and sort of. Their services

03:43:54.888 --> 03:43:55.388
what we're doing is a little

03:43:55.455 --> 03:43:57.290
bit now not not. It the we need

03:43:57.357 --> 03:44:01.060
to be you know very. Conscious

03:44:01.127 --> 03:44:09.536
about how we move forward with

03:44:09.602 --> 03:44:10.904
that- we. Do have a tremendous

03:44:10.970 --> 03:44:16.876
amount of. Complete add that

03:44:16.943 --> 03:44:18.912
flow from federal law at. Ten

03:44:18.978 --> 03:44:19.379
both in terms- and our

03:44:19.445 --> 03:44:21.281
compliance requirements for

03:44:21.347 --> 03:44:22.949
network adequacy I would argue

03:44:23.016 --> 03:44:25.318
in many cases are more rigorous

03:44:25.385 --> 03:44:27.153
than those that are required of

03:44:27.220 --> 03:44:35.862
the managed care plans today

03:44:35.929 --> 03:44:39.032
and. So we're going to continue

03:44:39.098 --> 03:44:39.599
to try to meet those height

03:44:39.666 --> 03:44:48.641
bars. At Lowe's up. My name I

03:44:48.708 --> 03:44:51.177
in our- estimates cal aim in no

03:44:51.244 --> 03:44:53.112
way will back fill. MHSAA

03:44:53.179 --> 03:45:04.791
dollars in in. I'm. Medical in

03:45:04.858 --> 03:45:07.160
a different way a change our

03:45:07.227 --> 03:45:09.362
payment systems per the payment

03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:13.032
reform proposal laid out and to

03:45:13.099 --> 03:45:13.633
build out these partnerships

03:45:13.700 --> 03:45:15.368
with medic help manage care

03:45:15.435 --> 03:45:20.607
that we can do a better job of

03:45:20.673 --> 03:45:23.142
adequately serving the medic

03:45:23.209 --> 03:45:23.776
how beneficiaries were in our

03:45:23.843 --> 03:45:24.410
program today. But as I said at

03:45:24.477 --> 03:45:28.948
the beach. This hearing. Is a

03:45:29.015 --> 03:45:29.515
long and important list of

03:45:29.582 --> 03:45:39.626
MHSAA fun activities that. Are

03:45:39.692 --> 03:45:41.261
not funded through Medicare all

03:45:41.327 --> 03:45:42.829
today that are not proposed

03:45:42.896 --> 03:45:43.429
funded under Medicare all that

03:45:43.496 --> 03:45:45.698
in many. To senator key point

03:45:45.765 --> 03:45:49.035
in mayor Sam regulate which

03:45:49.102 --> 03:45:49.502
includes a chronically

03:45:49.569 --> 03:45:54.874
homeless- involve population.

03:45:54.941 --> 03:45:56.809
Or at risk kids and so we

03:45:56.876 --> 03:45:57.377
really need to be thoughtful

03:45:57.443 --> 03:45:58.912
about some of the trade. No

03:45:58.978 --> 03:46:01.047
commercial plan parity thing

03:46:01.114 --> 03:46:03.016
that is the long game again the

03:46:03.082 --> 03:46:05.084
set the delivery system does

03:46:05.151 --> 03:46:07.120
not exist today and so really

03:46:07.186 --> 03:46:07.720
what we're gonna have to lift

03:46:07.787 --> 03:46:10.857
up his over time and again cal

03:46:10.924 --> 03:46:15.895
aim is not gonna be able to

03:46:15.962 --> 03:46:16.529
play again whatever those holes

03:46:16.596 --> 03:46:18.932
are they gonna be. Eating

03:46:18.998 --> 03:46:21.301
potentially by shifting or

03:46:21.367 --> 03:46:23.236
moving at. Dollars want to be

03:46:23.303 --> 03:46:25.004
really cool. Thank you for.

03:46:25.071 --> 03:46:27.173
Thank you and- in respect to

03:46:27.240 --> 03:46:31.110
the. To the many people who are

03:46:31.177 --> 03:46:33.079
here I will keep my comments

03:46:33.146 --> 03:46:37.917
short we will have time to

03:46:37.984 --> 03:46:42.655
further discuss calling. But I

03:46:42.722 --> 03:46:43.256
did want to say how excited I

03:46:43.323 --> 03:46:46.926
was. Being up for twenty. An

03:46:46.993 --> 03:46:49.095
eighty plus pages that it was-

03:46:49.162 --> 03:46:49.696
there's quite a bit of hope

03:46:49.762 --> 03:46:51.130
within the document and the

03:46:51.197 --> 03:46:53.433
value seems in the right place

03:46:53.499 --> 03:46:54.834
the brain is a part of the body

03:46:54.901 --> 03:46:55.335
and the better we can

03:46:55.401 --> 03:46:57.670
integrating create stingless

03:46:57.737 --> 03:46:59.372
systems the more efficient will

03:46:59.439 --> 03:47:02.008
be in providing care and I just

03:47:02.075 --> 03:47:11.517
appreciate the department's

03:47:11.584 --> 03:47:12.051
effort to end the county's

03:47:12.118 --> 03:47:12.752
efforts in working through-

03:47:12.819 --> 03:47:15.254
those hard conversations that

03:47:15.321 --> 03:47:15.788
need to be had it. Try you

03:47:15.855 --> 03:47:19.192
should now. With we will finish

03:47:19.258 --> 03:47:19.759
this and all and move on to

03:47:19.826 --> 03:47:24.130
public comment. Thank you. It

03:47:24.197 --> 03:47:25.999
is going to be the process for

03:47:26.065 --> 03:47:32.505
public comment is there a is

03:47:32.572 --> 03:47:35.908
there a- limit. As their just

03:47:35.975 --> 03:47:40.913
in terms of the number of

03:47:40.980 --> 03:47:42.982
people who are here I would.

03:47:43.049 --> 03:47:46.786
Try to keep it to her too okay.

03:47:46.853 --> 03:47:48.955
One size doesn't fit all. So

03:47:49.022 --> 03:47:52.759
well I can and I'm talking

03:47:52.825 --> 03:47:53.326
about culturally competent

03:47:53.393 --> 03:47:56.996
practices you cannot separate a

03:47:57.063 --> 03:48:00.266
mind from a culture you can't

03:48:00.333 --> 03:48:08.174
separate a mine from identity

03:48:08.241 --> 03:48:10.410
and there is a state wide. My

03:48:10.476 --> 03:48:13.246
program right dresses the needs

03:48:13.312 --> 03:48:17.216
of six Senate cat population

03:48:17.283 --> 03:48:18.885
and that's the cap you reduce.

03:48:18.951 --> 03:48:19.485
Sixty three at the state level

03:48:19.552 --> 03:48:20.853

03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:21.487

by the counties at least in L.

03:48:23.322 --> 03:48:26.859
A. county and whose continued

03:48:26.926 --> 03:48:28.928

03:48:28.995 --> 03:48:31.130
meet the needs of underserved

03:48:31.197 --> 03:48:34.867
populations we'll be going away

03:48:34.934 --> 03:48:36.969

03:50:01.387 --> 03:50:04.857
just that by. Just seconds.

03:50:04.924 --> 03:50:05.458

by Rick from. Your support is a

03:50:33.319 --> 03:50:36.956
critical part of MHSAA

03:50:37.023 --> 03:50:39.091
philosophy and outcomes my E.

03:50:39.158 --> 03:50:41.227
organization is a pure run

03:50:41.294 --> 03:50:43.162
organization in Los Angeles

03:50:43.229 --> 03:50:46.065
county and we have

03:50:46.132 --> 03:50:49.168
approximately fifty staff full

03:50:49.235 --> 03:50:52.905
time everybody with lived

03:50:52.972 --> 03:50:54.407
experience we have say funding

03:50:54.473 --> 03:50:57.076
does. Run right. And we have to

03:50:57.143 --> 03:50:59.011
run a program at. I was in Los

03:50:59.078 --> 03:51:01.314
Angeles county which takes on

03:51:01.380 --> 03:51:05.218
average two hundred dates from

03:51:05.284 --> 03:51:07.019
assessment to move in 40% of

03:51:07.086 --> 03:51:15.828
people that call us. For

03:51:15.895 --> 03:51:16.429
housing movin within two days

03:51:16.495 --> 03:51:16.996
of calling saying they want

03:51:17.063 --> 03:51:21.767
housing. Twenty they ask for

03:51:21.834 --> 03:51:22.902
housing one of the reasons that.

03:51:22.969 --> 03:51:23.502
Is because we're using census

03:51:23.569 --> 03:51:25.171
data and my- but all eyes on

03:51:25.238 --> 03:51:27.273
the single fan. Market and

03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:29.442
rental houses it anytime in Los

03:51:29.508 --> 03:51:33.646
Angeles there are ten thousand

03:51:33.713 --> 03:51:35.348
single family homes for rent

03:51:35.414 --> 03:51:35.881
one of the things that's

03:51:35.948 --> 03:51:38.618
happened with the discussion

03:51:38.684 --> 03:51:40.653
around housing is that it's

03:51:40.720 --> 03:51:42.888
been dominated by developers.

03:51:42.955 --> 03:51:49.729
Who've been taking away he from

03:51:49.795 --> 03:51:57.036
this. Your support as an

03:51:57.103 --> 03:51:59.805
essential element of housing

03:51:59.872 --> 03:52:04.410
first practices so when we look

03:52:04.477 --> 03:52:06.846
at MHSAA incorporating a way to

03:52:06.912 --> 03:52:08.914
make sure that peer support is

03:52:08.981 --> 03:52:14.787
involved at every ask of pro.

03:52:14.854 --> 03:52:15.354
Is essential we heard about

03:52:15.421 --> 03:52:17.590
full Sir. Partnerships as we

03:52:17.657 --> 03:52:18.090
rolled out mental health

03:52:18.157 --> 03:52:18.924
services in Los Angeles county.

03:52:18.991 --> 03:52:20.993
Understanding of how to

03:52:21.060 --> 03:52:22.962
integrate your support and

03:52:23.029 --> 03:52:24.764
people with lived experience we

03:52:24.830 --> 03:52:29.368
have that data now the other

03:52:29.435 --> 03:52:32.738
thing that's. Important when we

03:52:32.805 --> 03:52:33.339
look at hospitalization rates

03:52:33.406 --> 03:52:40.379
California has a sick. Large or

03:52:40.446 --> 03:52:41.013
great the hospitalization rate

03:52:41.080 --> 03:52:42.915
than the knack. National bridge

03:52:42.982 --> 03:52:43.549
and one of the reasons it's not

03:52:43.616 --> 03:52:46.986
because of how. Is this

03:52:47.053 --> 03:52:48.754
research clearly shows that

03:52:48.821 --> 03:52:51.057
merely referring somebody to a

03:52:51.123 --> 03:52:53.592
self help support group in the

03:52:53.659 --> 03:52:58.831
community cuts the re

03:52:58.898 --> 03:53:03.402
hospitalization. Rates by 50%

03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:08.874
okay and peer support

03:53:08.941 --> 03:53:09.475
specialist group which between

03:53:09.542 --> 03:53:10.042
people even services people.

03:53:10.109 --> 03:53:13.979
Dead the base services so

03:53:14.046 --> 03:53:14.513
please make sure out some

03:53:14.580 --> 03:53:17.817

the provider. African American

03:53:30.563 --> 03:53:31.630
great tease the part six

California rich despair no you

03:53:35.334 --> 03:53:38.838
want in your in your day out as

With a book another one. A son

03:53:53.519 --> 03:53:58.424
about any of. Reducing

03:53:58.491 --> 03:54:01.694
disparity predicate is. Invest

03:54:01.761 --> 03:54:03.696
in our culture we come can you

this. Let me please come and-

03:54:14.106 --> 03:54:14.607
let's talk about what a deep

03:54:14.673 --> 03:54:24.817
dive of a stakeholder

03:54:24.884 --> 03:54:25.484
engagement could look like with

03:54:25.551 --> 03:54:26.085
the populations that we start

03:54:26.152 --> 03:54:29.155
because it's up to. Six of the

03:54:29.221 --> 03:54:31.891
NHL. Shouldn't be that way and

03:54:31.957 --> 03:54:34.660
we want to be a. X. thing on

03:54:34.727 --> 03:54:40.132
twenty. Looking at in the se-

03:54:40.199 --> 03:54:43.903
inside when it that's my little

03:54:43.969 --> 03:54:44.470
CRT P. a piece but I wanted

03:54:44.537 --> 03:54:48.174
something- different a little

03:54:48.240 --> 03:54:49.708
heavy can you. With me and I

03:54:49.775 --> 03:54:55.181

genius. Nearest neighbor. And

03:55:00.119 --> 03:55:02.922
planning that needs for this

03:55:02.988 --> 03:55:03.556
you need think of like an image

03:55:03.622 --> 03:55:09.662
of state. But it the lines and

03:55:09.728 --> 03:55:10.262
it happened in the there's a

03:55:10.329 --> 03:55:12.031
there's an invisible elephant

03:55:12.097 --> 03:55:15.234
open the corner of the room and

03:55:15.301 --> 03:55:18.571
had to be black for the pink

03:55:18.637 --> 03:55:19.205
elephant it's a black elephant.

03:55:19.271 --> 03:55:25.144
And you look. Nothing. Areas

03:55:25.211 --> 03:55:31.984
that he says. Her time. This

03:55:32.051 --> 03:55:32.618
car serration fall steep yes.

03:55:32.685 --> 03:55:36.655
In schools talk about I risk.

03:55:36.722 --> 03:55:37.189
If you want to go make a

03:55:37.256 --> 03:55:37.790
difference is what it's about

03:55:37.857 --> 03:55:42.661
being. Amex the plants I have a

03:55:42.728 --> 03:55:48.267
solution. You would focus on

03:55:48.334 --> 03:55:52.771
children spelled. All with two.

03:55:52.838 --> 03:55:54.874
What do they have in common.

03:55:54.940 --> 03:55:58.844
Breath taking disproportion

03:55:58.911 --> 03:56:01.881
aliki of African Americans.

03:56:01.947 --> 03:56:10.556
Right taking. African Americans

03:56:10.623 --> 03:56:18.831
are in 7% Of the California. We

03:56:18.898 --> 03:56:25.070
5040% 40% if you do this within

03:56:25.137 --> 03:56:29.241
cost Asian if you what with

03:56:29.308 --> 03:56:33.345
foster if you do it with every

03:56:33.412 --> 03:56:33.946
single category this process.

03:56:34.013 --> 03:56:43.022
Does not these kinds of very.

03:56:43.088 --> 03:56:47.092
The man. Who some women now

phrase. This is Bob. This and.

That has to be addressed it has

03:58:08.340 --> 03:58:11.076
to be done with innovation.

03:58:11.143 --> 03:58:14.680

Our office is based in the LA

03:58:32.264 --> 03:58:33.298
area but I'm with the

03:58:33.365 --> 03:58:35.467
California Blackmun's how can

03:58:35.534 --> 03:58:36.101
we are a statewide organization

03:58:36.168 --> 03:58:39.605
and we were in the five

03:58:39.672 --> 03:58:45.978
population areas five there is

03:58:46.045 --> 03:58:46.645
a California counties that have

03:58:46.712 --> 03:58:48.747
the highest popular of black

03:58:48.814 --> 03:58:49.348
women and girls and so I tell

03:58:49.415 --> 03:58:51.016
people all the time. Get to.

03:58:51.083 --> 03:58:53.052
It's working what's not

03:58:53.118 --> 03:58:56.388
working. For the most part.

03:58:56.455 --> 03:59:03.262
Things are not working it is

03:59:03.328 --> 03:59:04.863
incredibly challenging. For the

03:59:04.930 --> 03:59:10.636
women that were with and their

03:59:10.703 --> 03:59:12.805
families and the communities.

03:59:12.871 --> 03:59:13.472
Where they live and we can play

03:59:13.539 --> 03:59:15.140
to access mental health care

03:59:15.207 --> 03:59:15.741
services. Whether or not to

03:59:15.808 --> 03:59:17.142
sing it through the public

03:59:17.209 --> 03:59:17.710
school system or through the

03:59:17.776 --> 03:59:19.645
private. Your the challenges

03:59:19.712 --> 03:59:20.312
are there and I'm sure a lot of

03:59:20.379 --> 03:59:21.647
people in this room who is

03:59:21.714 --> 03:59:22.247
specially when you talk about

03:59:22.314 --> 03:59:23.982
in a severe mental health cases.

03:59:24.049 --> 03:59:30.456
Work mostly with women who are

03:59:30.522 --> 03:59:31.056
on the cusp. And we consider

03:59:31.123 --> 03:59:35.527
our standing in the gap. Clean

03:59:35.594 --> 03:59:40.065
the limitations of Star.

03:59:40.132 --> 03:59:40.699
Culturally come the absence of

03:59:40.766 --> 03:59:43.102
pot. Exist to the work force me

03:59:43.168 --> 03:59:50.776
that. So we the value three.

03:59:50.843 --> 03:59:51.343
There is project because of

03:59:51.410 --> 03:59:53.312
that funding we're in year

03:59:53.378 --> 03:59:59.485
three being to. I'm. Have

03:59:59.551 --> 04:00:00.085
tested a program that we have

04:00:00.152 --> 04:00:11.096
that we're gonna. Can find. We

04:00:11.163 --> 04:00:11.697
have been able to train black

04:00:11.764 --> 04:00:16.034
women to be. At. Right now

04:00:16.101 --> 04:00:16.668
we're doing the program in Los

04:00:16.735 --> 04:00:21.540
Angeles we've done in

04:00:21.607 --> 04:00:22.107
Sacramento in- December Dino

04:00:22.174 --> 04:00:22.674
will be in the bay area in

04:00:22.741 --> 04:00:23.342
February and we're going around.

04:00:23.408 --> 04:00:27.546
Trying to DO Fresno.

04:00:27.613 --> 04:00:28.147
Partnership with the with our

04:00:28.213 --> 04:00:29.047
friend Fresno. One that we know

04:00:29.114 --> 04:00:31.683
this funding is going to end in

04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:35.420
two years and that scares me so

04:00:35.487 --> 04:00:35.988
much because we've done such

04:00:36.054 --> 04:00:37.790
incredible work- women who

04:00:37.856 --> 04:00:43.829
really are standing on the edge

04:00:43.896 --> 04:00:49.268
of needing fines. For their you

04:00:49.334 --> 04:00:49.835
know even even needed to be

04:00:49.902 --> 04:00:53.005
hospitalized. This serious

04:00:53.071 --> 04:00:53.605
mental breakdown and having to

04:00:53.672 --> 04:00:55.140
deal with it for a- minute

04:00:55.207 --> 04:00:55.774
which is nationally recognized

04:00:55.841 --> 04:00:57.309
based on traditional African

04:00:57.376 --> 04:00:59.845
American and African

04:00:59.912 --> 04:01:02.247
culturally. Lee deeply rooted-

04:01:02.314 --> 04:01:06.251
believed impress some practices

04:01:06.318 --> 04:01:09.621
and we are seeing. Incredible

04:01:09.688 --> 04:01:11.323
success. These were trained by

04:01:11.390 --> 04:01:14.860
us and then go out into the

04:01:14.927 --> 04:01:16.862
community so. I did I saw. AT

04:01:16.929 --> 04:01:19.064
and to be able to help too we

04:01:19.131 --> 04:01:19.665
could we create resource list

04:01:19.731 --> 04:01:20.933
on our own because we have to

04:01:20.999 --> 04:01:21.466
screen those resources so

04:01:21.533 --> 04:01:23.368
thoroughly because you don't

04:01:23.435 --> 04:01:26.038
want to send someone to a place

04:01:26.104 --> 04:01:27.406
that when they go through a-

04:01:27.472 --> 04:01:33.078
intake process they're not

04:01:33.145 --> 04:01:36.381
going to see a therapist for

04:01:36.448 --> 04:01:36.949
six to eight weeks. That's

04:01:37.015 --> 04:01:39.051
inconceivable unconscionable

04:01:39.117 --> 04:01:41.320
okay. Place where they can

04:01:41.386 --> 04:01:45.257
come. On in. Talkin healing

04:01:45.324 --> 04:01:47.960
dealing share in all of those

04:01:48.026 --> 04:01:52.231
things. I mean I could go on

04:01:52.297 --> 04:01:52.798
and I we have a website you

04:01:52.865 --> 04:01:53.398
know you really I could go on

04:01:53.465 --> 04:01:56.668
but I but I want to say because

04:01:56.735 --> 04:01:57.169
of the funding. For the

04:01:57.236 --> 04:02:03.442
California reducing despair

04:02:03.508 --> 04:02:04.343
project. We were able to see us.

04:02:04.409 --> 04:02:10.816
I am in a- oil in the first so.

04:02:10.883 --> 04:02:11.316
We are very powerful but

04:02:11.383 --> 04:02:16.555
there's. So these dollars and

04:02:16.622 --> 04:02:17.189
to know that it'll end in two

04:02:17.256 --> 04:02:19.024
years and that there's a novel

04:02:19.091 --> 04:02:23.195
nothing it played. Another

04:02:23.262 --> 04:02:26.899
phase of it or a chance to. In

04:02:26.965 --> 04:02:28.934
order to even wait those. You

04:02:29.001 --> 04:02:29.501
know those outcomes and then

04:02:29.568 --> 04:02:31.203
see how we continue. Most of

04:02:31.270 --> 04:02:31.770
them have never heard of it

04:02:31.837 --> 04:02:32.371
unfortunately and that is a

04:02:32.437 --> 04:02:33.305
problem as well so you've

04:02:33.372 --> 04:02:36.909
invested sixty million dollars

04:02:36.975 --> 04:02:39.011
in something that is working so

04:02:39.077 --> 04:02:42.648
please I mean I I'm hoping

04:02:42.714 --> 04:02:48.453
everyone in the line hears it

04:02:48.520 --> 04:02:49.054
and the people begin to talk

04:02:49.121 --> 04:02:49.655
about it so. Thank you for the

04:02:49.721 --> 04:02:59.064
opportunity. What she said.

04:02:59.131 --> 04:03:00.933
Good afternoon Frank center

04:03:00.999 --> 04:03:03.135
into some additional resources

04:03:03.201 --> 04:03:05.003
that you may or may not be

04:03:05.070 --> 04:03:08.874
avail aware of we were. Hired

04:03:08.941 --> 04:03:10.876
by the AC to do a study the

04:03:10.943 --> 04:03:12.911
first ever and only study about

04:03:12.978 --> 04:03:14.880
older older Californians and

04:03:14.947 --> 04:03:16.815
their use of mental health-

04:03:16.882 --> 04:03:21.687
services to the MHSAA and we

04:03:21.753 --> 04:03:23.422
produced. A number of policy

04:03:23.488 --> 04:03:25.757
briefs including one about

04:03:25.824 --> 04:03:26.258
indicators and then also

04:03:26.325 --> 04:03:31.930
looking. From grams and also I

04:03:31.997 --> 04:03:39.404
did. And I think it I just you

04:03:39.471 --> 04:03:41.206
can. I'm about Cashen today and

04:03:41.273 --> 04:03:41.807
one is that there seem to be

04:03:41.873 --> 04:03:44.810
kind of an assumption that P.

04:03:44.876 --> 04:03:45.410
E. I. money was for children

04:03:45.477 --> 04:03:47.279
and youth and I just wanted to

04:03:47.346 --> 04:03:50.549
make sure that you all know

04:03:50.615 --> 04:03:55.320
which I'm sure you do that P.

04:03:55.387 --> 04:03:55.921
E. I. programs are beneficial

04:03:55.988 --> 04:03:56.521
for all age groups across the

04:03:56.588 --> 04:03:59.891
life. And on into an agreement

04:03:59.958 --> 04:04:08.000
with Mister Corey. I hope that

04:04:08.066 --> 04:04:11.169
you'll. Be rid. Of the HSA as

04:04:11.236 --> 04:04:11.670
it was craft fundamental

04:04:11.737 --> 04:04:13.138
component of the- life. Which

04:04:13.205 --> 04:04:15.307
you. So as you think about

04:04:15.374 --> 04:04:17.275
prioritizing as you think about

04:04:17.342 --> 04:04:17.776
these kinds of special

04:04:17.843 --> 04:04:22.881
populations that were-

04:04:22.948 --> 04:04:23.448
discussed at length today I

04:04:23.515 --> 04:04:25.283

soon to be 20% of our

04:04:28.987 --> 04:04:30.989
population they have high unmet

04:04:31.056 --> 04:04:31.523
needs their greatly under

04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:33.225
served we've got the data the

04:04:33.291 --> 04:04:37.462
OAC has the data we want to

04:04:37.529 --> 04:04:38.063
make sure that you continue

04:04:38.130 --> 04:04:39.498
looking at all the populations

04:04:39.564 --> 04:04:44.936
across the entire lifespan as

04:04:45.003 --> 04:04:47.039
you think about. Your

04:04:47.105 --> 04:04:47.639

04:08:40.238 --> 04:08:43.008
statement on the MHS. Refresh

04:08:43.074 --> 04:08:43.541
however there is much more

04:08:43.608 --> 04:08:44.175
discussion that must take place

04:08:44.242 --> 04:08:45.310
in. Public and not just like

04:08:45.377 --> 04:08:46.978

04:08:47.045 --> 04:08:48.813
May just was not intended to

fix every social determinants

04:08:49.514 --> 04:08:51.216
of health and in humanity in

04:08:51.283 --> 04:08:53.251
California it was intended to

04:08:53.318 --> 04:08:55.820
fund the greatest health

04:08:55.887 --> 04:08:57.989
disparity of serious mental

04:08:58.056 --> 04:09:01.626
illness the current emphasis on

04:09:01.693 --> 04:09:03.928
the sweeping her homelessness.

04:09:03.995 --> 04:09:05.096
Let's focus on the fact that

04:09:05.163 --> 04:09:07.032
families are wired to make. In

04:09:07.098 --> 04:09:09.134
order enter yes needed for

04:09:09.200 --> 04:09:11.136
stability any fix for the

04:09:11.202 --> 04:09:13.271
homelessness crisis must go

04:09:13.338 --> 04:09:15.040
beyond a right to shelter and

04:09:15.106 --> 04:09:16.975
it must go beyond only those

04:09:17.042 --> 04:09:30.021
currently on sheltered a right

04:09:30.088 --> 04:09:31.623
to shelter plan must. Include

04:09:31.690 --> 04:09:33.024
access to a full continuum of

04:09:33.091 --> 04:09:33.558
psychiatric services and

04:09:33.625 --> 04:09:35.193
include a full of what I have

04:09:35.260 --> 04:09:39.464
caught what might I point. That

04:09:39.531 --> 04:09:40.098
here families. If we are going

04:09:40.165 --> 04:09:41.399
to unclog the human log jam in

04:09:41.466 --> 04:09:42.000
our streets prisons jails in

04:09:42.067 --> 04:09:45.003
the back bedroom Eiji. Federal

04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:46.938
then we must focus on both the

04:09:47.005 --> 04:09:49.007
un shelter homeless and the at

04:09:49.074 --> 04:09:51.176
risk of homeless at some my

04:09:51.242 --> 04:09:51.776
populations who cannot live

04:09:51.843 --> 04:09:54.779
independently we first need a

04:09:54.846 --> 04:09:55.413
right to treatment before we

04:09:55.480 --> 04:09:57.282
forced anyone with a serious

04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:59.017
mental illness to fail first

04:09:59.084 --> 04:10:01.286
suffer and die if we want to

04:10:01.353 --> 04:10:14.999
California for all. Then the

04:10:15.066 --> 04:10:15.500
California a must be on

04:10:15.567 --> 04:10:19.170

going to ultra taker offer

04:13:43.841 --> 04:13:45.143

04:13:47.145 --> 04:13:49.347
specific options for the more

04:13:49.414 --> 04:13:50.882
intense patients more evidence

04:13:50.949 --> 04:13:53.251
based research. My daughter is

04:13:53.318 --> 04:13:55.019
the compensation teen as I

04:13:55.086 --> 04:13:59.223
speak she does not need unitive

04:13:59.290 --> 04:14:00.825
approach but a rehabilitative

04:14:00.892 --> 04:14:04.829
approach so please help- she

04:14:04.896 --> 04:14:06.965
has. Feeling like she has no

04:14:07.031 --> 04:14:07.632
purpose right now no meaning in

04:14:07.699 --> 04:14:11.369
life and she's like who cares I

04:14:11.436 --> 04:14:13.137
may just go kill myself. So

04:14:13.204 --> 04:14:21.112
that's what I'm left with. To

04:14:21.179 --> 04:14:21.713

04:14:33.124 --> 04:14:35.293
my daughter and others like it

04:14:35.360 --> 04:14:37.161

04:14:37.228 --> 04:14:43.601
like you said. There has to be

04:14:43.668 --> 04:14:44.702
a flow there has to be a. Point

04:14:44.769 --> 04:14:47.005
in life where these people are

04:14:47.071 --> 04:14:51.142
people just get the place. So

04:14:51.209 --> 04:14:54.846
please helper thank you ma'am.

04:14:54.912 --> 04:14:56.881
Hi people full I'm also with

04:14:56.948 --> 04:15:00.985
cal voices in and access and

04:15:01.052 --> 04:15:03.021

A. client consumer family.

04:15:10.128 --> 04:15:11.029
Member culture and the recovery

04:15:11.095 --> 04:15:13.231
culture the recovery model can

04:15:13.297 --> 04:15:16.300
be tested to. Steam men no

04:15:16.367 --> 04:15:19.070
doubt we remain dysfunctional

04:15:19.137 --> 04:15:19.671
it is a fail first system of

04:15:19.737 --> 04:15:20.938
attrition no one gets in with

04:15:21.005 --> 04:15:22.840
heated attempts with agencies

04:15:22.907 --> 04:15:24.842

04:15:27.278 --> 04:15:28.813
do break through the first

04:15:28.880 --> 04:15:29.447
treatment phases not recovery

04:15:29.514 --> 04:15:31.115
but often times a flavor of the

04:15:31.182 --> 04:15:39.824
month- team of medications that

04:15:39.891 --> 04:15:40.324
will worsen. Oftentimes

04:15:40.391 --> 04:15:42.226
worsening condition. We recover

04:15:42.293 --> 04:15:45.430

Good news. Habits and brain

04:15:51.636 --> 04:15:52.970
old patterns no longer serving

04:15:53.037 --> 04:15:53.638

the ever help landscape has

04:16:53.664 --> 04:16:55.399

for those who are incarcerated

04:17:36.774 --> 04:17:41.946

04:17:59.764 --> 04:18:02.200

Prevention early intervention

involved collaborations

04:18:21.786 --> 04:18:22.920
required between schools and

local committee based

04:18:23.454 --> 04:18:23.955
organizations. On the work

04:18:24.021 --> 04:18:25.489
force strictly behavior health

04:18:25.556 --> 04:18:26.958
workforce pipeline by providing

04:18:27.024 --> 04:18:27.491
funding for education and

primary school high school and

04:18:31.863 --> 04:18:35.833
college levels. And from the

04:18:35.900 --> 04:18:36.400
expansion the roles of peers

04:18:36.467 --> 04:18:37.001
and other non licensed health

04:18:37.068 --> 04:18:41.339
care professional. Sep I used

04:18:41.405 --> 04:18:41.939
to sort of counselors. This is

04:18:42.006 --> 04:18:43.341
the care separate cells the

04:18:43.407 --> 04:18:45.209

the adult an older adult

04:18:45.810 --> 04:18:47.211
systems of care. By dividing

04:18:47.278 --> 04:18:47.745
the committee service and

04:18:47.812 --> 04:18:49.146
support funding into two

04:18:49.213 --> 04:18:49.780
systems of care and rewrite the

04:18:49.847 --> 04:18:57.188
guidelines for each. Older

04:18:57.255 --> 04:18:59.357
adults identify the prevalence

04:18:59.423 --> 04:18:59.924
of older adults impacted by

04:18:59.991 --> 04:19:03.227
hope this. Hi fi the different

04:19:03.294 --> 04:19:03.828
levels of need for adults then

04:19:03.895 --> 04:19:07.198
the full. The term in the most

04:19:07.265 --> 04:19:07.798
cost effective you the four of

04:19:07.865 --> 04:19:09.267
the fines added. On at this

04:19:09.333 --> 04:19:12.870
piece for older population. And

04:19:12.937 --> 04:19:13.437
finally- on evaluation and

04:19:13.504 --> 04:19:16.407
accountable. Both of the

04:19:16.474 --> 04:19:16.974
language of the image a say

04:19:17.041 --> 04:19:17.541
regarding the reports that

04:19:17.608 --> 04:19:22.780
counties must DAC gaps in the-

04:19:22.847 --> 04:19:25.349
I see an ally consequence.

04:19:25.416 --> 04:19:29.020
Going to do so and- the rules

04:19:29.086 --> 04:19:29.587
and responsibilities at the

04:19:29.654 --> 04:19:31.355
very least. If I wish and

04:19:31.422 --> 04:19:37.261
accountability thank you Sir.

04:19:37.328 --> 04:19:38.896
Good evening so bad with United

04:19:38.963 --> 04:19:39.430
ways of California animal

04:19:39.497 --> 04:19:40.965
attempt to stream comments that.

04:19:41.032 --> 04:19:43.334
In in housing we believe that

04:19:43.401 --> 04:19:43.868
prop sixty three can be a

04:19:43.935 --> 04:19:45.503
cattle. Mrs as a whole and as a

04:19:45.569 --> 04:19:46.070
key element in drawing down

04:19:46.137 --> 04:19:46.871
federal match for Medicaid

04:19:46.938 --> 04:19:49.807
spending as well as realizing

04:19:49.874 --> 04:19:50.841
the true intent of the PST T.

04:19:50.908 --> 04:19:53.210
I've we ever wanted to

04:19:53.277 --> 04:19:53.878
transform the mental health and

04:19:53.945 --> 04:19:55.012
substance use. Disorder system

04:19:55.079 --> 04:19:55.613
we need to become much more

04:19:55.680 --> 04:19:57.281
intentional around PI and begin

04:19:57.348 --> 04:19:59.383
a shift away from over path

04:19:59.450 --> 04:20:00.851
ology Ising our children and

04:20:00.918 --> 04:20:03.054
youth and particularly those

04:20:03.120 --> 04:20:04.889
that are exposed to trauma.

04:20:04.956 --> 04:20:05.489
Trauma does not equal mental

04:20:05.556 --> 04:20:07.224
illness but untreated I'm I can

04:20:07.291 --> 04:20:09.126
lead to serious health and

04:20:09.193 --> 04:20:10.995
mental health risks and hard

04:20:11.062 --> 04:20:11.562
realities we face on the

04:20:11.629 --> 04:20:13.230
streets today we think that the

04:20:13.297 --> 04:20:14.932
partnership between counties

04:20:14.999 --> 04:20:15.433
and schools cannot be

04:20:15.499 --> 04:20:18.069
overstated and well examples of

04:20:18.135 --> 04:20:18.936
using P. I **** in this manner

04:20:19.003 --> 04:20:23.774
exist we believe. More can and

04:20:23.841 --> 04:20:24.375
should be done and at the role

04:20:24.442 --> 04:20:25.376
commute. Successful will be

04:20:25.443 --> 04:20:27.244
necessary. This is where the

04:20:27.311 --> 04:20:28.779
support of the legislature and

04:20:28.846 --> 04:20:29.413
the- ocean comes into play. We

04:20:29.480 --> 04:20:31.115
can help establish local

04:20:31.182 --> 04:20:33.217
collaborative- frameworks to

04:20:33.284 --> 04:20:35.052
make this happen. Klay in terms

04:20:35.119 --> 04:20:37.154
of housing we can concur with

04:20:37.221 --> 04:20:38.923
other stakeholders and

04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:42.893
panelists. That homelessness is

04:20:42.960 --> 04:20:44.895
not- is not primarily an issue

04:20:44.962 --> 04:20:45.496
of mental illness but one of

04:20:45.563 --> 04:20:46.097
affordability housing stock in

04:20:46.163 --> 04:20:46.964
income inequality. No doubt

04:20:47.031 --> 04:20:49.400
that the role the MHSAA has and

04:20:49.467 --> 04:20:52.937
will continue to have instant-

04:20:53.004 --> 04:20:53.504
is substantial it is only a

04:20:53.571 --> 04:20:55.006
slice of the statewide pie.

04:20:55.072 --> 04:20:57.241
Having a an alignment with

04:20:57.308 --> 04:20:58.743
other efforts such as cal aim

04:20:58.809 --> 04:20:59.210
will be important in

04:20:59.276 --> 04:21:01.145
addressing- the housing and

04:21:01.212 --> 04:21:02.947
homelessness crisis that has

04:21:03.014 --> 04:21:04.882
been many decades in the making

04:21:04.949 --> 04:21:07.184
and I think you for the

04:21:07.251 --> 04:21:07.785
attention of this committee to

04:21:07.852 --> 04:21:08.419
this issue. Thank you thank you

04:21:08.486 --> 04:21:11.088
ma'am. A good afternoon.

04:21:11.155 --> 04:21:11.655
Members of the committee my

04:21:11.722 --> 04:21:13.324
name is now I have to ask miss

04:21:13.391 --> 04:21:15.092
and the- legislative policy

04:21:15.159 --> 04:21:17.128
analyst praxis California. I am

04:21:17.194 --> 04:21:18.963
with cal voices formally nor

04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:20.965
cal MHA the oldest Pirenne

04:21:21.032 --> 04:21:21.432
mental health agency.

04:21:21.499 --> 04:21:23.034
Organization our advocacy

04:21:23.100 --> 04:21:24.935
organization in California. I

04:21:25.002 --> 04:21:25.469
am a consumer with lived

04:21:25.536 --> 04:21:27.304
experience and I support my

04:21:27.371 --> 04:21:29.073
colleague Mister carries

04:21:29.140 --> 04:21:30.875
testimony from earlier today.

04:21:30.941 --> 04:21:31.509
The MHSAA does not need to be

04:21:31.575 --> 04:21:33.144
changed to refresh it simply

04:21:33.210 --> 04:21:36.847
simply needs to be reinforced.

04:21:36.914 --> 04:21:39.116
For state level report since

04:21:39.183 --> 04:21:39.650
two thousand thirteen and

04:21:39.717 --> 04:21:40.251
verify the lack of oversight

04:21:40.317 --> 04:21:41.152
and accountability to local

04:21:41.218 --> 04:21:41.719
community planning process

04:21:41.786 --> 04:21:45.056
sees. And also by state level

04:21:45.122 --> 04:21:47.091
agencies that created the on

04:21:47.158 --> 04:21:47.591
spam HSA surplus. That

04:21:47.658 --> 04:21:49.460
represents a broken system that

04:21:49.527 --> 04:21:50.995
we talk about today. If today's

04:21:51.062 --> 04:21:53.097
hearing is in response to the

04:21:53.164 --> 04:21:55.066
homelessness crisis. Then you

04:21:55.132 --> 04:21:57.001
should know that those those

04:21:57.068 --> 04:21:57.601
that are at greatest risk or

04:21:57.668 --> 04:21:58.869
people with extremely low

04:21:58.936 --> 04:21:59.370
income. And the income

04:21:59.437 --> 04:22:01.138
disparities primarily put focus

04:22:01.205 --> 04:22:03.074
upon black and brown

04:22:03.140 --> 04:22:06.811
communities. Approximately

04:22:06.877 --> 04:22:08.779
ninety four thousand- over

04:22:08.846 --> 04:22:09.413
seventy four percent. Of those

04:22:09.480 --> 04:22:10.014
experiencing homelessness are

04:22:10.081 --> 04:22:11.215
in more need of living wages

04:22:11.282 --> 04:22:15.052
and affordable transit.

04:22:15.119 --> 04:22:15.619
Oriented housing rather than

04:22:15.686 --> 04:22:18.889
mental health services. The

04:22:18.956 --> 04:22:19.457
MHSAA find is reserved for

04:22:19.523 --> 04:22:21.225
mental health services for

04:22:21.292 --> 04:22:21.859
fourteen million public mental

04:22:21.926 --> 04:22:23.027
system clients. I secondly I

04:22:23.094 --> 04:22:24.895
wanted to echo that client and

04:22:24.962 --> 04:22:25.563
consumers must be treated as a

04:22:25.629 --> 04:22:27.198
central partners. In our

04:22:27.264 --> 04:22:29.133
discussions regarding the

04:22:29.200 --> 04:22:29.767
proposed change changes to the

04:22:29.834 --> 04:22:33.070
M. HSA. At one additional

04:22:33.137 --> 04:22:33.637
comment that I wanted to

04:22:33.704 --> 04:22:35.139
include what was to Mr Mr

04:22:35.206 --> 04:22:37.241
freighter assembly member

04:22:37.308 --> 04:22:39.176
Frasier's I request. For budget

04:22:39.243 --> 04:22:40.811
asks for primary policy

04:22:40.878 --> 04:22:41.479
proposals C. R. D. P. has been

04:22:41.545 --> 04:22:43.180
looking for- budgetary

04:22:43.247 --> 04:22:46.851
reallocation or- sponsorship

04:22:46.917 --> 04:22:47.485
for the last couple of years.

04:22:47.551 --> 04:22:49.386
The O. A. C. as- push them to

04:22:49.453 --> 04:22:51.355
find to advocate for their own

04:22:51.422 --> 04:22:53.090
funding so that would be one

04:22:53.157 --> 04:22:53.591
thing to perfect primary

04:22:53.657 --> 04:22:55.326
prioritize. For moving forward

04:22:55.392 --> 04:22:57.261
as a permanent funding

04:22:57.328 --> 04:22:59.063
structure also the governor

04:22:59.130 --> 04:23:01.031
knew some propose that the

04:23:01.098 --> 04:23:02.867
budget was a primary source for

04:23:02.933 --> 04:23:03.400
funding for peer support

04:23:03.467 --> 04:23:05.236
systems in California on the

04:23:05.302 --> 04:23:09.273
veto of. S. B. ten so there is

04:23:09.340 --> 04:23:11.408
an opportunity to present

04:23:11.475 --> 04:23:12.042
services as a priority point in

04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:17.047
the budget this year. Good

04:23:17.114 --> 04:23:17.715
evening Mister chair I'm fairly

04:23:17.781 --> 04:23:19.183
dating on behalf of the

04:23:19.250 --> 04:23:21.185
California state association of

04:23:21.252 --> 04:23:21.785
counties I'm going to be very

04:23:21.852 --> 04:23:23.187
specific us the sack and our

04:23:23.254 --> 04:23:25.289
members the county supervisors

04:23:25.356 --> 04:23:26.924
of California support five

04:23:26.991 --> 04:23:28.993
different things that would

04:23:29.059 --> 04:23:34.532
include counties retaining the

04:23:34.598 --> 04:23:35.065
funding you've seen many

04:23:35.132 --> 04:23:35.699
examples today of how. Counties

04:23:35.766 --> 04:23:39.069
work with non profits schools

04:23:39.136 --> 04:23:39.703
other local government entities

04:23:39.770 --> 04:23:50.814
and. Some we really strongly

04:23:50.881 --> 04:23:51.448
encourage flexibility we do up

04:23:51.515 --> 04:23:53.050
some disorder. Really serve

04:23:53.117 --> 04:23:53.684
those folks would help quite a

04:23:53.751 --> 04:23:56.887
bit- don't wanna narrowing up

04:23:56.954 --> 04:23:57.488
senator Steinberg talks about

04:23:57.555 --> 04:23:58.088
serving homelessness and those

04:23:58.155 --> 04:23:58.722
in the criminal justice system

04:23:58.789 --> 04:24:00.124
and we don't again. Want people

04:24:00.191 --> 04:24:00.758
to fall into those categories

04:24:00.824 --> 04:24:01.392
before we can help them right

04:24:01.458 --> 04:24:03.427
now with them and just say we

04:24:03.494 --> 04:24:03.961
can help the before that

04:24:04.028 --> 04:24:06.964
happens. And we do not ship the

04:24:07.031 --> 04:24:07.565
last few years along with the

04:24:07.631 --> 04:24:09.233
homeless is funny to really

04:24:09.300 --> 04:24:11.035
focus on that. For those who

04:24:11.101 --> 04:24:11.569
are homeless plus all age

04:24:11.635 --> 04:24:13.304
groups. Who need services who

04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:15.172
aren't homeless- we also think

04:24:15.239 --> 04:24:17.341
cal aim is a great opportunity

04:24:17.408 --> 04:24:19.076
and really are really excited

04:24:19.143 --> 04:24:20.911
about the- sense of partnership

04:24:20.978 --> 04:24:24.381
from DH CS and appreciate

04:24:24.448 --> 04:24:25.082
their- obstacle- working groups

04:24:25.149 --> 04:24:28.719
and seeking counties in but as

04:24:28.786 --> 04:24:35.726
well as- of course consumers

04:24:35.793 --> 04:24:36.327
and providers. At least port

04:24:36.393 --> 04:24:38.963
accountability and transparency.

04:24:39.029 --> 04:24:41.198
This as the director the truck

04:24:41.265 --> 04:24:42.800
had to. Do it we work. It the

04:24:42.866 --> 04:24:44.902
present reserve level when

04:24:44.969 --> 04:24:45.502
people criticize the reserves

04:24:45.569 --> 04:24:46.136
to figure out how the money can

04:24:46.203 --> 04:24:47.238
be use we've done everything we

04:24:47.304 --> 04:24:47.805
can to make it specific and

04:24:47.871 --> 04:24:49.240
make all picture all counties

04:24:49.306 --> 04:24:51.075
are complaining we need your

04:24:51.141 --> 04:24:53.210
help to have that single

04:24:53.277 --> 04:24:53.777
oversight entity to make it

04:24:53.844 --> 04:24:54.345
happen. Thank you thank you

04:24:54.411 --> 04:24:58.916
ma'am. Kelly Brooks I'm here

04:24:58.983 --> 04:24:59.550
this afternoon on behalf of the

04:24:59.617 --> 04:25:01.318
urban counties of California.

04:25:01.385 --> 04:25:03.687
The fort to our fourteen county

04:25:03.754 --> 04:25:07.057
members represent 80% of the

04:25:07.124 --> 04:25:07.658
total population of the state

04:25:07.725 --> 04:25:10.961
we too are please. Public

04:25:11.028 --> 04:25:12.896
conversation going on around

04:25:12.963 --> 04:25:15.065
the whole. Act were lakes

04:25:15.132 --> 04:25:15.566
supportive of increased

04:25:15.633 --> 04:25:16.233
flexibility and I think this is

04:25:16.300 --> 04:25:17.401
a good opportunity to have

04:25:17.468 --> 04:25:18.969
further conversations about.

04:25:19.036 --> 04:25:20.971
Making substance use disorder-

04:25:21.038 --> 04:25:23.040
up primary diagnosis of

04:25:23.107 --> 04:25:24.975
substance use disorder. As a

04:25:25.042 --> 04:25:27.311
potential- that at me to say

04:25:27.378 --> 04:25:27.945
could from those services- we

04:25:28.012 --> 04:25:29.280
would encourage a very careful

04:25:29.346 --> 04:25:31.148
and thoughtful discussion

04:25:31.215 --> 04:25:33.050
around MHSAA. Particularly

04:25:33.117 --> 04:25:33.684
since we know so many of our

04:25:33.751 --> 04:25:35.185
counties are using I meant to

04:25:35.252 --> 04:25:36.820
say is match for federal

04:25:36.887 --> 04:25:41.592
Medicaid funds. And so we don't

04:25:41.659 --> 04:25:42.259
want to see our existing mental

04:25:42.326 --> 04:25:42.926
health services system.

04:25:42.993 --> 04:25:47.131
Disrupted by a potentially

04:25:47.197 --> 04:25:49.933
moving money around. We ought.

04:25:50.000 --> 04:25:51.402
To represent the count or side

04:25:51.468 --> 04:25:53.404
who has use that mental health

04:25:53.470 --> 04:25:55.005
services act as the glue- to

04:25:55.072 --> 04:25:55.572
their entire mental health

04:25:55.639 --> 04:25:57.975
system they're doing very. Made

04:25:58.042 --> 04:25:58.609
of things up around integrating

04:25:58.676 --> 04:26:04.415
primary care and behavioral

04:26:04.481 --> 04:26:05.015
health and the kinds of things

04:26:05.082 --> 04:26:08.686
that I think cal aim is headed

04:26:08.752 --> 04:26:11.355
port. They. Make sure their

04:26:11.422 --> 04:26:12.990
system continues to be event.

04:26:13.057 --> 04:26:14.858
I'm dead and then finally.

04:26:14.925 --> 04:26:17.161
Homeless and mental health I

04:26:17.227 --> 04:26:17.761
was just at a conference last

04:26:17.828 --> 04:26:18.962
week with the return

04:26:19.029 --> 04:26:19.496
researchers from UC San

04:26:19.563 --> 04:26:32.176
Francisco looking at adults

04:26:32.242 --> 04:26:32.776
over the age of fifty who are

04:26:32.843 --> 04:26:33.310
becoming homelessness. And

04:26:33.377 --> 04:26:33.844
behavior health isn't the

04:26:33.911 --> 04:26:39.116
reason the. Reason. Chris

04:26:39.183 --> 04:26:41.118
stoner Mertz California. Family

04:26:41.185 --> 04:26:41.719
services we have a hundred and

04:26:41.785 --> 04:26:43.120
forty five members serving

04:26:43.187 --> 04:26:43.721

04:26:45.356 --> 04:26:47.224
behavioral health and education

04:26:47.291 --> 04:26:49.193
systems. I'll be brief and will

04:26:49.259 --> 04:27:02.539
submit a more expansive

04:27:02.606 --> 04:27:11.048
comments- primarily I just want

04:27:11.115 --> 04:27:11.648
to say that I think that with

04:27:11.715 --> 04:27:12.182
the current development of

04:27:12.249 --> 04:27:13.016
Callaham

04:27:13.083 --> 04:27:15.018

04:27:15.085 --> 04:27:16.987
Access to services. Really

04:27:17.054 --> 04:27:19.123
appears to help that insert

04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:21.825
pushing the boundaries of the

04:27:21.892 --> 04:27:22.459
current funding options and we

04:27:22.526 --> 04:27:22.993
have to hold ourselves

04:27:23.060 --> 04:27:27.531
accountable to serving our most

04:27:27.598 --> 04:27:28.098
vulnerable and marginalized

04:29:24.481 --> 04:29:24.982
cultural groups I'm really

04:29:25.048 --> 04:29:28.919
needs to be recognized I'm

04:29:28.986 --> 04:29:31.722
Frank from UCLA I mentioned her

04:29:31.788 --> 04:29:32.823
research what she didn't

04:29:32.890 --> 04:29:35.626
mention was that they felt that

04:29:35.692 --> 04:29:38.061
adults get about one. Point 5%

04:29:38.128 --> 04:29:43.000
The fact that they probably are

04:29:43.066 --> 04:29:43.500
stigmatized in any other

04:29:43.567 --> 04:29:56.113
population groups- age why.

04:29:56.179 --> 04:29:57.080
Early intervention hundreds of

04:29:57.147 --> 04:29:58.949
them from falling into. I

04:29:59.016 --> 04:30:01.118
should ending. Woman as your

04:30:01.184 --> 04:30:02.953
health. Did you lose friends

04:30:03.020 --> 04:30:04.755
and your economic situation

04:30:04.821 --> 04:30:07.658
falls- I wanted to thank

04:30:07.724 --> 04:30:11.094
director Cabrera for mentioning

04:30:11.161 --> 04:30:12.696
the issue of homelessness in

04:30:12.763 --> 04:30:17.000
the older adult population.

04:30:17.067 --> 04:30:21.104
Outs are complete- rapidly

04:30:21.171 --> 04:30:21.705
became the largest percentage

04:30:21.772 --> 04:30:29.012
of the population. The research

04:30:29.079 --> 04:30:32.382
is that I did from doctor

04:30:32.449 --> 04:30:33.050
Margot the show. Found that up.

04:30:33.116 --> 04:30:36.386
These people to go into

04:30:36.453 --> 04:30:37.020
homelessness but once an older

04:30:37.087 --> 04:30:37.621
adult becomes homes they fall

04:30:37.688 --> 04:30:43.594
into. So we urge you to think

04:30:43.660 --> 04:30:49.633
of them now if the framework we

04:30:49.700 --> 04:30:50.233
don't ask for more he asked to

04:30:50.300 --> 04:30:54.504
be considered does your needs.

04:39:04.527 --> 04:39:07.130
percent. Meaning to an

04:39:07.197 --> 04:39:11.234
unrepresentative. I ask them to

04:39:11.301 --> 04:39:13.536

04:39:29.953 --> 04:39:35.458

04:39:36.126 --> 04:39:42.999

advocacy and found exactly and

04:40:46.329 --> 04:40:49.632
that meant. A contract and we

04:40:49.699 --> 04:40:51.601

04:40:59.075 --> 04:41:03.079
There's no accountability and.

04:41:03.146 --> 04:41:07.050
But to help. Please wait. Let's

today the value of community

04:50:05.421 --> 04:50:07.723
defined practices and we would

04:50:07.790 --> 04:50:08.257
hope that these types of

04:50:08.324 --> 04:50:11.761
practices are really woven into

04:50:11.827 --> 04:50:12.361
the fabric of how we deliver

04:50:12.428 --> 04:50:17.333

that we can sustain on these

04:50:18.734 --> 04:50:22.538
programs and making sure they

04:50:22.605 --> 04:50:26.475
don't just die as funds dry up

04:50:26.542 --> 04:50:27.042
but they actually are taken

04:50:27.109 --> 04:50:28.944
into consideration. By counties

04:50:29.011 --> 04:50:30.279
at a love scene that they help

04:50:30.346 --> 04:50:32.515

04:50:32.581 --> 04:50:35.885
the most vulnerable under

04:50:35.951 --> 04:50:36.519
served in a- community member.

04:50:36.585 --> 04:50:40.389

opportunity to give public

04:50:57.173 --> 04:50:58.841
comment today and to be able to

04:50:58.908 --> 04:51:01.710
beat him in this long

04:51:01.777 --> 04:51:03.813
individuals who definitely

04:51:03.879 --> 04:51:08.083
wanted to lend their voices it

04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:10.953
is where topic I do want to

04:51:11.020 --> 04:51:13.122
acknowledge before I. Give in

04:51:13.189 --> 04:51:14.957
to my public comment. Attached

04:51:15.024 --> 04:51:17.092
to her you have the public.

04:51:17.159 --> 04:51:21.030
Left and it doesn't necessarily

04:51:21.096 --> 04:51:22.932
support the camaraderie that I

04:51:22.998 --> 04:51:26.335

04:51:26.402 --> 04:51:29.839
MHSAA really. Calls for so I

04:51:29.905 --> 04:51:31.807
just wanted to speak but I.

04:51:31.874 --> 04:51:35.144
Still hear especially those

04:51:35.211 --> 04:51:35.744
individuals who are decision

04:51:35.811 --> 04:51:41.116
making. To revamp our revised-

04:51:41.183 --> 04:51:43.419
things that have not accurately

04:51:43.485 --> 04:51:48.390
been executed therefore it

04:51:48.457 --> 04:51:48.991
cannot accurately be assessed

04:51:49.058 --> 04:51:51.894
so I really feel as if the

04:51:51.961 --> 04:51:57.233
MHSAA is accurately exit. Then

04:51:57.299 --> 04:51:59.168
we can stand back and we can

04:51:59.235 --> 04:52:01.203
make us as- to what we need to

04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.837
revamp things or provide over

04:52:09.311 --> 04:52:09.812
Meaning to stick that were

04:52:09.879 --> 04:52:12.581

04:52:19.488 --> 04:52:19.989
someone who has provided a

04:52:20.055 --> 04:52:24.260
significant amount of different

04:52:24.326 --> 04:52:24.860
levels of care of for various

04:52:24.927 --> 04:52:27.396
MHSAA funded. Plans to

04:52:27.463 --> 04:52:29.498
consumers of mental health

04:52:29.565 --> 04:52:30.132
services here in Sacramento for

04:52:30.199 --> 04:52:31.901
over a decade and now having

04:52:31.967 --> 04:52:40.910
the- able to provide- support

04:52:40.976 --> 04:52:43.612
and honesty it level. Oldest

04:52:43.679 --> 04:52:46.916
and state why. Is the

04:52:46.982 --> 04:52:47.549
organization here in California

04:52:47.616 --> 04:52:52.388
support. How it really call

04:52:52.454 --> 04:52:52.922
unprecedented amount of

04:52:52.988 --> 04:52:55.624
meaningful. And stakeholder

04:52:55.691 --> 04:52:56.191
involvement- I'd have to say

04:52:56.258 --> 04:53:03.132
that. It's I see the point

04:53:03.198 --> 04:53:05.200
system partnering not only

04:53:05.267 --> 04:53:06.969
include Jack up can. As the-

04:53:07.036 --> 04:53:07.469
cramming administration

04:53:07.536 --> 04:53:09.371
revisions implementation and

04:53:09.438 --> 04:53:13.475
all the other areas that MHSAA

04:53:13.542 --> 04:53:16.745
funded programming. Is mandated

04:53:16.812 --> 04:53:17.346
by the act to specifically do-

04:53:17.413 --> 04:53:22.318
and I we have a panel of. And

04:53:22.384 --> 04:53:29.925
that's full. We would be

04:53:29.992 --> 04:53:30.559
violate their original intent

04:53:30.626 --> 04:53:31.260
act by. Not ensure that you

04:53:31.327 --> 04:53:33.429
have the part of consumers in

04:53:33.495 --> 04:53:35.130
numbers. And provide. As we've

04:53:35.197 --> 04:53:37.499
heard respective to whether or

04:53:37.566 --> 04:53:39.335
not these expansions are these

04:53:39.401 --> 04:53:41.136
new ideas that are at the table

04:53:41.203 --> 04:53:41.804
are really what they need to

04:53:41.870 --> 04:53:45.908
sell we must do a better job

04:53:45.975 --> 04:53:46.508
job it and genuinely enforce

04:53:46.575 --> 04:53:52.514
the act across the state order

04:53:52.581 --> 04:53:53.115
early assessed it in attempt

04:53:53.182 --> 04:53:57.786
revisions. If necessary. In

04:53:57.853 --> 04:54:05.094
Cannes in up. The in our state

04:54:05.160 --> 04:54:05.694
to its full statute and what.

04:54:05.761 --> 04:54:07.429
Because I say as a previous

04:54:07.496 --> 04:54:09.398
service- has provided those

04:54:09.465 --> 04:54:11.433
definite fill in the gaps that

04:54:11.500 --> 04:54:13.302
people can't get anywhere else

04:54:13.369 --> 04:54:15.404
and I've seen people come from

04:54:15.471 --> 04:54:18.207
the gutter and florist because

04:54:18.273 --> 04:54:19.908
of the MHSAA as it is right

04:54:19.975 --> 04:54:26.382
now- so I really just want to

04:54:26.448 --> 04:54:28.150
consider our apps.

04:54:28.217 --> 04:54:28.817
Consideration that the image of

04:54:28.884 --> 04:54:30.919
the state as it is and it's

04:54:30.986 --> 04:54:32.821
really work forcing it and then

04:54:32.888 --> 04:54:33.422
after we've had a proper time

04:54:33.489 --> 04:54:35.224
to. Set it. Pollution of the

04:54:35.290 --> 04:54:45.334
community thank you thank you.

04:54:49.104 --> 04:54:51.040
what Tiffany said- it is rather

04:54:51.106 --> 04:54:51.673
contain set for seven hours but

04:54:51.740 --> 04:54:53.409
we really believe what we have

04:54:53.475 --> 04:54:53.976
to say that's why there's so

04:54:54.043 --> 04:54:55.978
many people here that more.

04:54:56.045 --> 04:54:57.479
Speaks to the value of input-

04:54:57.546 --> 04:54:58.080
for us to be clear at the end

04:54:58.147 --> 04:55:01.283
of the day I've I've come with

04:55:01.350 --> 04:55:02.951

04:55:03.018 --> 04:55:05.821
disabilities that that through

04:55:05.888 --> 04:55:10.826
this whole thing and heard. One

04:55:10.893 --> 04:55:13.395
speaker but none of those.

People are here to hear us so I

04:55:14.096 --> 04:55:15.130
just want to say that. My name

04:55:15.197 --> 04:55:17.132
is. The way. It is. The others

04:55:17.199 --> 04:55:19.501
have been here today- I. Am

04:55:19.568 --> 04:55:23.172
also someone who is happier. I

04:55:23.238 --> 04:55:23.806
have lived experience I've been

04:55:23.872 --> 04:55:25.707
hospitalized in state yeah.

04:55:25.774 --> 04:55:31.680
Spittle I'm also a mother I had

04:55:31.747 --> 04:55:32.915
a child who had autism and-

04:55:32.981 --> 04:55:35.150
diet. And cancer six years ago

04:55:35.217 --> 04:55:37.252
it's Chris. And another. US

04:55:37.319 --> 04:55:37.886
panic disorder. And IT. I also

04:55:37.953 --> 04:55:39.455
have a sister who was diagnosed

04:55:39.521 --> 04:55:40.022
with schizophrenia many many

04:55:40.089 --> 04:55:43.292
years ago. Also growing up I

04:55:43.358 --> 04:55:47.563
was chronically homeless from a

04:55:47.629 --> 04:55:48.130
very young age and with my

04:55:48.197 --> 04:55:51.400
children. So I also grew up in

04:55:51.467 --> 04:55:53.135
a culture of poverty and I know

04:55:53.202 --> 04:55:57.239
what it means to be a big pile

04:55:57.306 --> 04:55:57.840
of money and think I know how

04:55:57.906 --> 04:56:02.744
to spend it better than

04:56:02.811 --> 04:56:05.747
anything else. I know how much.

04:56:05.814 --> 04:56:06.281
Homelessness is a big deal

04:56:06.348 --> 04:56:12.921
because it was me. I. I've been

04:56:12.988 --> 04:56:13.455
a counselor and working in

04:56:13.522 --> 04:56:14.957
crisis services. Five you. An

04:56:15.023 --> 04:56:19.394

MHSAA programs and peer support.

04:56:25.968 --> 04:56:29.538
The fifteen minutes from

04:56:29.605 --> 04:56:30.139
paradise. As you know with the

04:56:30.205 --> 04:56:40.516
camp. A we had a- we. Now have

04:56:40.582 --> 04:56:41.116
a four thousand people that on

04:56:41.183 --> 04:56:41.717
back to pick. The community as

04:56:41.783 --> 04:56:42.618
a fifty this. And a lot of that

04:56:42.684 --> 04:56:45.420
falls in our community. And now

04:56:45.487 --> 04:56:48.924
in a that led state in. Fire

04:56:48.991 --> 04:56:52.828
now has thousands and thousands

04:56:52.895 --> 04:56:53.428
of people they're traumatized

04:56:53.495 --> 04:56:59.501
living in trailers to this day.

04:56:59.568 --> 04:57:00.102
I heard me talk about ninety

04:57:00.169 --> 04:57:04.273
homeless people. I've done a

04:57:04.339 --> 04:57:06.175
lot of studying was sharing and

04:57:06.241 --> 04:57:09.077
visited other based. On that

04:57:09.144 --> 04:57:09.678
fifty thousand of those Thomas

P. born out on. Distribute

04:57:12.047 --> 04:57:12.581
right what does that mean the

04:57:12.648 --> 04:57:15.117
other counties. They're

04:57:15.184 --> 04:57:15.717
different needs and different

04:57:15.784 --> 04:57:16.218
approaches and different

04:57:16.285 --> 04:57:19.288
counties. I represent the

04:57:19.354 --> 04:57:21.023
Superior region where the

04:57:21.089 --> 04:57:22.824
northernmost sixteen counties

04:57:22.891 --> 04:57:25.460

Nevada border from the Oregon

04:57:26.128 --> 04:57:28.997
border to just north of

04:57:29.064 --> 04:57:31.733
Sacramento. We are a will hate

04:57:31.800 --> 04:57:33.635
wide part of tell off nor and

04:57:33.702 --> 04:57:35.871
culture you know you have. To

04:57:35.938 --> 04:57:36.471
the bay but they forget about

04:57:36.538 --> 04:57:39.274
the four hours north. I

04:57:39.341 --> 04:57:42.711
represent the report in

04:57:42.778 --> 04:57:43.212
northern California real

northern California. In a. Is

04:57:48.784 --> 04:57:52.588
that the techniques and the

04:57:52.654 --> 04:57:53.222
this this is offer to someone

04:57:53.288 --> 04:57:55.090
it tent on a sidewalk in. It's

04:57:55.157 --> 04:57:55.557
going to be completely

04:57:55.624 --> 04:57:57.893
different than the person next

04:57:57.960 --> 04:57:58.427

they're two completely

04:58:00.629 --> 04:58:00.996
different there are

04:58:01.063 --> 04:58:05.167
similarities but- unless you

04:58:05.234 --> 04:58:05.767
give that people are back to

04:58:05.834 --> 04:58:07.469
the communities and the peers

04:58:07.536 --> 04:58:09.137
and people that are in those

04:58:09.204 --> 04:58:09.705
places. You won't know what

04:58:09.771 --> 04:58:14.443

access they taught me what this

04:58:45.107 --> 04:58:45.574
is about in that. Case we

04:58:45.641 --> 04:58:51.680
shared that with more. We may

05:00:07.889 --> 05:00:08.423
the key fob. Jewel projects

05:00:08.490 --> 05:00:10.025
through the California using

05:00:10.092 --> 05:00:19.468
this project. Aside learn. In

05:00:19.534 --> 05:00:20.135
the old days thirty five which

05:00:20.202 --> 05:00:24.172
is used to- I was stuck in in

05:00:24.239 --> 05:00:24.706
twenty five years and the

05:00:24.773 --> 05:00:26.141
mental health and- to note

05:00:26.208 --> 05:00:26.842
thirty five agencies. Do and

05:00:26.908 --> 05:00:34.149
reached. I'm incredibly

05:00:34.216 --> 05:00:36.718
innovative ways to serve an

05:00:36.785 --> 05:00:39.121
engaged to get these. Sure for

05:00:39.187 --> 05:00:41.523
many many years. I went to pick

05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:45.160
up when I speak about

05:00:45.227 --> 05:00:48.296
engagement hi engagement that

05:00:48.363 --> 05:00:55.137
actually has come in from both

05:00:55.203 --> 05:00:55.704
trends agents reach in the

05:00:55.771 --> 05:00:57.973
community. By community re

05:00:58.039 --> 05:00:59.408
reaching out the agencies that

05:00:59.474 --> 05:01:00.041
we work with that can get. Aids

05:01:00.108 --> 05:01:03.345
utilization of server but I can

05:01:03.412 --> 05:01:06.415
tell you too many stories.

05:01:06.481 --> 05:01:06.982
About success not all of our

05:01:07.048 --> 05:01:07.616
agency but through the- he's in

05:01:07.682 --> 05:01:17.058
this price. But really what is

05:01:17.125 --> 05:01:21.163
that community define prop says

05:01:21.229 --> 05:01:21.763
I really could not think of to

05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:23.632
be. Our community is in the

05:01:23.698 --> 05:01:27.202
cage so we can reduce Sperry's.

05:01:27.269 --> 05:01:29.504
In thinking that straight into

05:01:29.571 --> 05:01:32.474
presents and straight into

05:01:32.541 --> 05:01:32.941
homelessness straight

05:01:33.008 --> 05:01:38.346
utilisation of Sir says of

05:01:38.413 --> 05:01:38.914
mental health that could be

05:01:38.980 --> 05:01:42.617
avoided if we are. Prevention.

05:01:42.684 --> 05:01:47.422
Schindler's up for them. I urge

05:01:47.489 --> 05:01:52.661
you to please find this program

05:01:52.727 --> 05:01:53.228
played on an- the two years

05:01:53.295 --> 05:01:55.430
that we have left. Was re

05:01:55.497 --> 05:01:59.067
create trouble for them no it

05:01:59.134 --> 05:02:07.642
is happen. My name is Allison

05:02:07.709 --> 05:02:12.481
Monroe. From Alameda county I'm

05:02:12.547 --> 05:02:17.552
ready full doesn't mom and

05:02:17.619 --> 05:02:23.058
family members in Alameda can.

05:02:23.124 --> 05:02:31.399
List a that's the norm for them.

05:02:31.466 --> 05:02:31.967
And so we have perhaps a

05:02:32.033 --> 05:02:32.501
different point of view on

05:02:32.567 --> 05:02:42.744
MHSAA. There's two things. Well

05:02:42.811 --> 05:02:46.014
first of all we don't we're not

05:02:46.081 --> 05:02:51.753
a refresh. Of M. HSA and the

05:02:51.820 --> 05:02:56.491
direction that binder. Hello in

05:02:56.558 --> 05:02:59.995
two homeless as. It's sick that

05:03:00.061 --> 05:03:02.664
the homes with those prices are

05:03:02.731 --> 05:03:07.636
likely to not. All my family

05:03:07.702 --> 05:03:14.075
member. Would not stick in is

05:03:14.142 --> 05:03:18.113
there. License license support

05:03:18.179 --> 05:03:18.680
housing they're not burdened

05:03:18.747 --> 05:03:27.956
cares. But MHSAA my hand care.

05:03:28.023 --> 05:03:28.557
I've heard from Robert Wratten

05:03:28.623 --> 05:03:31.126
without a county. To spend a

05:03:31.192 --> 05:03:33.828
lot MHSAA my on both ears.

05:03:33.895 --> 05:03:37.032
Capital in technologies funds.

05:03:37.098 --> 05:03:37.632
This time or money to help the

05:03:37.699 --> 05:03:43.505
sickest. So we went ahead and

05:03:43.572 --> 05:03:44.105
place I am and we are not. Of

05:03:44.172 --> 05:03:47.609
another. Process it would take

05:03:47.676 --> 05:03:48.243
money that's supposed to be for

05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:53.281
this basically now and spend it

05:03:53.348 --> 05:03:56.318
in. Other cars cannot break

05:03:56.384 --> 05:03:56.885
because I'm sure but not our

05:03:56.952 --> 05:04:00.088
children's. There's two things

05:04:00.155 --> 05:04:03.458
we want to things basically-

05:04:03.525 --> 05:04:04.025
are the group does is called

05:04:04.092 --> 05:04:07.195
Alemannic as me. One is what

05:04:07.262 --> 05:04:13.401
treatment beds. Say at times

05:04:13.468 --> 05:04:14.002
the money can be spent a lot

05:04:14.069 --> 05:04:16.871
facilities but it has and it

05:04:16.938 --> 05:04:20.342
could be it's me you can't

05:04:20.408 --> 05:04:20.875
spend it on a long term.

05:04:20.942 --> 05:04:23.178
Facilities or tail. But in a

05:04:23.244 --> 05:04:28.116
few. Crisis treatment you would

05:04:28.183 --> 05:04:29.184
help. And again we would like

05:04:29.250 --> 05:04:35.523
it might be money Borden cares

05:04:35.590 --> 05:04:36.024
that's something that's

05:04:36.091 --> 05:04:37.525
desperately missing. But I

05:04:37.592 --> 05:04:41.463
think we're a person the hope

05:04:41.529 --> 05:04:46.234
of me Hey. To the can't record

05:04:46.301 --> 05:04:49.137
trip days if he gets in trouble

05:04:49.204 --> 05:04:51.206
if he is if he smokes if he

05:04:51.272 --> 05:04:53.475
does this to that. He can come

05:04:53.541 --> 05:04:57.078
back that place he home. That

05:04:57.145 --> 05:05:00.982
put a boarding care ida B.

05:05:01.049 --> 05:05:01.516
that's what we ought to be

05:05:01.583 --> 05:05:10.592
doing. It to save money. Not

05:05:10.659 --> 05:05:12.794
everybody. Is well enough to be

05:05:12.861 --> 05:05:20.135
able to live in an apartment.

05:05:20.201 --> 05:05:24.572
Good. I can't stand to put

05:05:24.639 --> 05:05:29.044
billion to spend. Which should

05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.644
be spent on many things are a

05:05:29.711 --> 05:05:35.216
few things. Needs spent on the

05:05:35.283 --> 05:05:37.652
ten thousand. In the state

05:05:37.719 --> 05:05:39.521
county there's maybe six

05:05:39.587 --> 05:05:45.026
hundred. The rooms in a jail on

05:05:45.093 --> 05:05:48.930
bogus trifling charges. Those

05:05:48.997 --> 05:05:51.099
people need to be helped and

05:05:51.166 --> 05:05:53.768
they ought to ideally if the

05:05:53.835 --> 05:05:55.103
system worked each one of them

05:05:55.170 --> 05:06:01.142
would have a choice whenever

05:06:01.209 --> 05:06:07.315
they needed it. Either a short.

05:06:07.382 --> 05:06:09.084
Statement civility or. A good

05:06:09.150 --> 05:06:09.718
boarding care bed. When they're

05:06:09.784 --> 05:06:13.188
well. Can stable income. Was it

05:06:13.254 --> 05:06:15.323
in more with one board I wish

05:06:15.390 --> 05:06:17.192
under these. We only have.

05:06:17.258 --> 05:06:17.759
Three Philip facilities like

05:06:17.826 --> 05:06:21.262
synergy. And that's probably

05:06:21.329 --> 05:06:21.896
enough you know I'm not talking

05:06:21.963 --> 05:06:23.364
about a lot of people I'm not

05:06:23.431 --> 05:06:24.966
talking about half the

05:06:25.033 --> 05:06:25.433
population record the

05:06:25.500 --> 05:06:27.202
population or even 4% of the

05:06:27.268 --> 05:06:29.204
population I'm talking about

05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.804
ten thousand people and their

05:06:29.871 --> 05:06:33.208
families. And I brought this T.

05:06:33.274 --> 05:06:35.076
shirt today it has a picture

05:06:35.143 --> 05:06:36.945
mark repeat. He lives in Solano

05:06:37.011 --> 05:06:39.047
county he lives on the street

05:06:39.114 --> 05:06:41.049
he has schizophrenia and T. B.

05:06:41.116 --> 05:06:43.418
R. I. any as a piece of metal

05:06:43.485 --> 05:06:45.019
in his leg he has no eyes. But

05:06:45.086 --> 05:06:48.990
he's homeless and his family's

05:06:49.057 --> 05:06:49.591
tried everything. To get him

05:06:49.657 --> 05:06:51.326
off the street. Everything he's

05:06:51.392 --> 05:06:57.699
been switched back and forth

05:06:57.766 --> 05:07:00.101
between the TV I system.

05:07:00.168 --> 05:07:00.702
Whatever consists of. And the

05:07:00.769 --> 05:07:02.871
mental health system and. He

05:07:02.937 --> 05:07:04.973
wanders off from work at his

05:07:05.039 --> 05:07:05.573
family watched him die in the

05:07:05.640 --> 05:07:07.142
street very slowly. Here's they

05:07:07.208 --> 05:07:09.010
bring in food you know they try

05:07:09.077 --> 05:07:09.611
to dry out as close a bring a

05:07:09.677 --> 05:07:11.446
phone. You know they listen to

05:07:11.513 --> 05:07:14.949
what he has to say. But if our

05:07:15.016 --> 05:07:16.918
state can't do the right thing

05:07:16.985 --> 05:07:19.020
for this guy there is no kit of

05:07:19.087 --> 05:07:20.955
ours is safe so that's why I

05:07:21.022 --> 05:07:21.556

05:08:03.097 --> 05:08:05.200
now she's even more frustrated

05:08:05.266 --> 05:08:05.800
because in a way it happening

05:08:05.867 --> 05:08:15.243
again. My. MH when the needs

05:08:15.310 --> 05:08:15.844

05:08:15.910 --> 05:08:18.780
being met and are meant to hold

05:08:18.847 --> 05:08:21.482
minority communities. Enforce

05:08:21.549 --> 05:08:22.917
MH at the funds don't take any.

05:08:22.984 --> 05:08:26.821
Money away let's make a- from

05:08:26.888 --> 05:08:30.825
the number one who spoke today

05:08:30.892 --> 05:08:35.430
we have the living experience.

05:08:35.496 --> 05:08:37.966
We lived through this every day.

05:08:38.032 --> 05:08:41.135
Thank you ma'am. Hi my name is

issue that's speak even eight.

05:09:09.230 --> 05:09:09.731
There's not Asian people the

05:09:09.797 --> 05:09:13.401
onus. Strong stigma like other

05:09:13.468 --> 05:09:18.139
coach and the also the line if.

05:09:18.206 --> 05:09:23.578
And. People is this the home-

05:09:23.645 --> 05:09:30.685
I'm here I think greed mentor

05:09:30.752 --> 05:09:31.319
and the- the pre vision is more

05:09:31.386 --> 05:09:31.886
important than that shorter

05:09:31.953 --> 05:09:35.356
show the goal for. Forum he I

05:09:35.423 --> 05:09:42.130
think. I do get the phone calls

05:09:42.196 --> 05:09:42.697
a lot from because from the

05:09:42.764 --> 05:09:44.098
family member on the these even

05:09:44.165 --> 05:09:48.903
call me thank. The more there

05:09:48.970 --> 05:09:50.905
because of the Senate. The four

05:09:50.972 --> 05:09:55.176
knives on the she- know what to

05:09:55.243 --> 05:10:01.015
do so she- toss the. Model on

05:10:01.082 --> 05:10:02.850
their end so that's the whole

05:10:02.917 --> 05:10:05.053
hard that she didn't know where

05:10:05.119 --> 05:10:07.121
our hotel ask for help also- I

05:10:07.188 --> 05:10:09.123
talked to a on TV see

05:10:09.190 --> 05:10:13.061
international students he asked

05:10:13.127 --> 05:10:19.067
for help as I told her him and

05:10:19.133 --> 05:10:19.634
with the phone number he can

05:10:19.701 --> 05:10:23.137
call one of the. Phone numbers

05:10:23.204 --> 05:10:26.107
a hotline he said that he. Did

05:10:26.174 --> 05:10:29.010
the call the one time. Other

05:10:29.077 --> 05:10:31.079
understanding him I understand

05:10:31.145 --> 05:10:35.283
that much. At prices he hung up

05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:37.251
on the phone still and pay for

05:10:37.318 --> 05:10:37.785
him the language is more

05:10:37.852 --> 05:10:43.791
important so that's the. All I

05:10:43.858 --> 05:10:47.862
ask is that the T. programming

05:10:47.929 --> 05:10:48.830
costs across the county they're

05:10:48.896 --> 05:10:55.636
small language if for that or

05:10:55.703 --> 05:11:03.277
Chinese. And also nami has a

05:11:03.344 --> 05:11:05.913
lot of a program like a vision

05:11:05.980 --> 05:11:10.118
that Konami basics we only have

05:11:10.184 --> 05:11:17.525
English materia I we can have a

05:11:17.592 --> 05:11:18.159
phone that to translate the two

05:11:18.226 --> 05:11:21.095
Chinese so. Get the teachers to

05:11:21.162 --> 05:11:21.662
teach that program to get to

05:11:21.729 --> 05:11:23.064
the issue and the also. The

05:11:23.131 --> 05:11:25.533
also like I said that the

05:11:25.600 --> 05:11:27.201
crisis line I really hope that

05:11:27.268 --> 05:11:31.005
could directly save a life even

05:11:31.072 --> 05:11:33.908
there's the language because

05:11:33.975 --> 05:11:36.010
some part of that- so it does

05:11:36.077 --> 05:11:42.517
all I hear for today. Thank you

05:11:42.583 --> 05:11:50.425
for listening to me you can.

05:11:50.491 --> 05:11:51.025
Diane my son has the disorder

05:11:51.092 --> 05:11:53.561
at I'm in a complete treatment

05:11:53.628 --> 05:11:57.198
all. Your services he walked

05:11:57.265 --> 05:11:59.000
away from everything that was

05:11:59.067 --> 05:12:01.836
offered to him fifty one

05:12:01.903 --> 05:12:02.403
fifties don't work because

05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:08.309
there aren't enough. He has to

05:12:08.376 --> 05:12:10.878
wait to get into a bad or he

05:12:10.945 --> 05:12:11.379
pulled through internet

05:12:11.446 --> 05:12:13.014
internet internet over and over

05:12:13.081 --> 05:12:15.650
and over. Not enough of a full.

05:12:15.716 --> 05:12:17.118
When he was there for like a

05:12:17.185 --> 05:12:21.856
three month period at batter.

05:12:21.923 --> 05:12:22.423
Becoming homies off his meds

05:12:22.490 --> 05:12:29.430
and he just. Spirals down again

05:12:29.497 --> 05:12:33.668
hello. When he was off could

05:12:33.734 --> 05:12:34.235
become violent and it was a

05:12:34.302 --> 05:12:35.736
tragedy he tried to move his

05:12:35.803 --> 05:12:36.304
stab me twenty six times. I

05:12:36.370 --> 05:12:42.710
lived through it. My son I want

05:12:42.777 --> 05:12:44.612
him to be treated ticket treat

05:12:44.679 --> 05:12:49.917
meant and that means that bad.

05:12:49.984 --> 05:12:50.551
In jail he can be in jail for a

05:12:50.618 --> 05:12:55.223
long time. Him to go to the

05:12:55.289 --> 05:12:58.259
apple doesn't. Have any bad

05:12:58.326 --> 05:13:03.064
sick at least a two year wait.

05:13:03.131 --> 05:13:03.631
And where is it for him can

05:13:03.698 --> 05:13:06.067
refuse. And I'm- not by if you.

05:13:06.134 --> 05:13:12.673
It's and he deserves to have

05:13:12.740 --> 05:13:14.275
life. And he's been screwed

05:13:14.342 --> 05:13:20.148
over by the spy system in

05:13:20.214 --> 05:13:23.718
California probably has one of
