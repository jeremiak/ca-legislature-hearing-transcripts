**** NILLY- ON AT ALL AND I

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:58.536
WOULD GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF MOST

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:00.338
RECENTLY OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:02.006
DECLARATIONS OF A STATE OF

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:03.808
EMERGENCY AROUND A DROUGHT.

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:05.843
WHERE HE VERY QUICKLY ARE NOT

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.813
VERY QUICKLY BUT BUT- EARLIER

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.481
DECLARED THAT TWO COUNTIES

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:11.883
WE'RE IN A DROUGHT AND HAD A

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:13.284
STATE OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE- IN

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:16.020
SEDONA TWO COUNTIES OF WHICH-

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:18.389
MARIN RECEIVES WATER FROM-

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:19.157
BESIDES OUR OWN LOCAL

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:20.725
RESERVOIRS MARIN COUNTY HAS

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:22.360
DECLARED ITSELF IN A DROUGHT

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:24.028
BUT YET THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:25.530
DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:28.533
IN MARIN SO THAT'S YOU KNOW A

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:31.135
LITTLE BIT OF A ANALOGY OF

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:32.970
GOVERNORS DO WITH THEIR OWN

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:35.440
COURSE OF DETERMINATION TO GET

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:39.477
TO A VERY SERIOUS- NAMING OF

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:40.812
WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS A

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:43.047
STATE OF EMERGENCY SO I WOULD

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:44.882
IMAGINE. THAT IF THERE IS A

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.151
SIGNIFICANT COST RECOVERY ISSUE

00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:49.420
FOR EXAMPLE- IF WE WANT WANTED

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:52.156

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:54.725
BECAUSE OF SOME EVENT TRIGGERED

00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:57.195
BY A P. S. P. S. THAT MIGHT BE

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.229
WHERE A GOVERNOR WOULD BE

00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:02.934
STEPPING. IN IF THERE'S A

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.534
SIGNIFICANT COST ISSUE. THANK
