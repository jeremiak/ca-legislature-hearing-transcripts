I'D SAY A FEW OF US HERE IN THE IN THE ROOM ON THIS COMMITTEE WERE ALSO- PART OF BUDGET SUB FIVE IN ORCHARDS HERE- BUT THE EARLIER THIS WEEK WE WERE PRESENTED WITH. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT- DOLLAR AMOUNT I'M TRYING TO LOOK THAT UP AS I- WHICH WOULD A JUMPS OUT IT HAD ME AS AS POSSIBLY RE DUNDON- YEAH I JUST WANTED S. MISLEAD IF ACTION IF THAT'S GONNA SOMEHOW MITIGATE OR REDUCE OF WHAT WE SAW IN IN SOME FIVE HOURS THAT. SOMEHOW GOING TO BE TACKED TOGETHER FOR A COMBINED LARGER AMOUNT. I'M SURE THINKING SATURDAY- SO THE- AMOUNT FOR YOU IT'S FOR THE CURRENT YEAR THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REQUEST IN THE BUDGET FOR THE BUDGET YEAR WHICH ARE ON TOP OF THIS ONE POINT NINE BILLION SO THERE ARE ROUGHLY ABOUT- I HAVE TO ADD THIS TOGETHER BUT- THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR CONTACT TRACING.

SO ESSENTIALLY IT IS A COMBINED AMOUNT THAT SPREAD OUT OVER- MULTIPLE BUDGET YEARS IS WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IF THAT'S- RESULT OF A MISCALCULATION. IT. FIVE IN MISLEADING FACTUALLY JUST TO CLARIFY HAJJAJ SAID USING IT WITH IT IN A- YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CARE. GO AHEAD OKAY GREAT I'M JUST TO CLARIFY FOR A SENATOR COULD YOU SEE THE TWO HUNDRED SIX. MILLION IS ADDITIONAL FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. SO THEY WERE ALREADY FUNDS INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AX BORDER- THE DEPARTMENT FOR COOK FOR CORRECTIONS- IN ADDITION TO THAT. WE FIND OURSELVES NEEDING AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED SIX MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. RIGHT IN IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP. WITH ONE MORE QUESTION MANAGER SO I MEAN I KNEW THE BILL'S THEMSELVES- DON'T TYPICALLY DEAL WITH ANY KIND OF A DEEP DIVE ON IMPLEMENTATION ACCOUNTABILITY HAS JUST- BECAUSE OUR- LEGISLATION. THAT SAID. IT IS I KNOW THIS IS COME UP AND SOME OTHER- PERHAPS A PREVIOUS- A BUDGET COMMITTEE. HEARING OR OR ELSEWHERE. THINGS MOVED- NECESSARILY THE MOVIE SO QUICKLY ESPECIALLY AROUND NINETY IT JUST IT RAISES THE ISSUE FOR ME AND I THINK SOME OTHERS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AS TO- HOW WE KEEP UP WITH ACCOUNTABILITY. AND NOT TO THE OVERLY PECAN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE BUT AS WE'RE ADDING. TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE POINT FIVE IS YOU JUST EXPLAIN FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WE'RE- TRYING TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS DECISIONS- IN COMMITTEE ON THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. HOW DO WE KNOW HOW THE- HOW WELL THEY'VE DEPLOYED. OR HOW EFFECTIVELY- YEAR TO DATE FUNDS HAVE BEEN. IMPLEMENTED YOU KNOW JUST FROM ACCOUNTABILITY STANDPOINT AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT QUESTION IS FOR. MISLI YORK OR SOMEBODY ELSE CAN. JUST GIVE ME A TOP LINE KIND OF RESPONSE TO THAT IN A WORD TO SENATOR SKINNER JUST TO LET YOU KNOW HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME HEARING ANYONE IN THE CHAMBER RIGHT NOW BUT YOU CAN'T HEAR US. IS THAT THE ISSUE. OKAY YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE HEARING US ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE- POLICY CENTER CORTESE WE WILL GET YOU THAT ANSWER LET'S JUST SEE WHAT OUR I. T. PROBLEM IS AT THE MOMENT. I'M SO COLLEAGUES I'M GONNA HOLD OFF YELLING OR HAVING A HARD TIME LIKE THIS IT DEPART THE I. T. PROMISE OKAY. WELL NINE. WHAT'S NEW. WHILE WE CORRECT THE I. T. PROBLEM WILL BE ON RECESSED FOR JUST FIVE MINUTES SO WHY DO WE EXPECT TO HAVE IT CORRECTED WITHIN FIVE MINUTES BUT WE ARE GONNA PAUSE RECESSED FOR FIVE MINUTES IN ORDER TO GET THE I. T. ISSUE CORRECTED. WE WILL NOW RESUME THE HEARING SENATOR CORTESE HAD THE FLOOR HE WAS ASKING QUESTIONS OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- CENTER CORTESE DO YOU WANNA YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF. YOU WATER IT WATER YOU JUST RESUME YOUR QUESTION AND THEN WE CAN TURN IT BACK TO ERICA GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY- IN THE END DURING THE FIVE MINUTE RECESS- IN IN. REVIEWING THE- MISLEADS RESPONSE I UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. WHAT'S BEING ADDED TO THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR VERSUS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- IN SUBPART BUDGET COMMITTEE RELATIVE TO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR SO- I DO UNDERSTAND I DO HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL. FOLLOW UP. QUESTION IN- IF I'M A MAN CHARGES YOU MAY BE LIKE A CAR. BUT IT IS A QUESTION- ALSO IN ALSO IN SUB FIVE WE SAW IT. THE VACCINATION. FIGURES THE PENETRATION OF THE VACCINATION AMONGST BOTH EMPLOYEES AND INMATES OF THE FEDERAL COURTS. TO LET YOU KNOW YOU'RE BREAKING UP AGAIN. FIVE FIFTY WONDER IF IT'S YOUR IF IT SENATOR CORTESE'S MIKE OR NOT. YOU CAN HEAR ME- MS LEE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES I CAN HEAR YOU OKAY SO GO OVER. BYE WE'RE WE'RE JUST GONNA MOVE YEAH GO AHEAD TRY HAT. AND THEN TRY TO TALK LOUDLY OKAY I WILL GO AHEAD WITH THE MASK THAT NUMBER HAD- MISLI THANK YOU TO FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS- AGAIN. CITING THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING IN IN THE SUB FIVE COMMITTEE- AROUND CDCR- THE DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDED IN TERMS OF THE PENETRATION OF VACCINATION- IS CERTAINLY FAR BELOW 1100% IS A IS A RECALL. EMPLOYEES WERE HOVERING AROUND. THE 70% RANGE INMATES WERE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. BACK TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY QUESTION I WAS ASKING EARLIER- IN AN INTERVIEW FOR THAT QUESTION BUT THE QUESTION WAS WAS. REALLY AREN'T AT PERFECT AT WHAT POINT. ASIDE FROM THIS. PROTECT YOUR BILL- DO WE GET IT TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THAT FOR THE INVEST ALREADY MADE IN THOSE POLICIES ALREADY ADOPTED SO THE QUESTION IS THIS HAVE A 1100% VACCINE MANDATE ESSENTIALLY- FOR CDC ARE. IF THAT. BUT THAT MANDATE- WERE ANYWHERE NEAR A 100% WOULDN'T MITIGATE- THE NEED TO MAKE THESE CURRENT INVESTMENTS THIS INVESTMENT IN THE INVESTMENT PRODUCT THAT WE WERE REFERRING TO RELATIVE TO NEXT YEAR AND DOES ANYBODY. HAVE ANY METRICS ON THAT AS TO. HOW MUCH WE COULD REDUCE BUT IN OUR OUR OUR BUDGETARY COST HERE- BY SIMPLY ENFORCING HUNDREDS OF VACCINE MANDATE AT CDC ARE. BUT YES I THANK YOU FOR REPEATING A QUESTION I DIDN'T HEAR THE FIRST TIME AND I JUST WANT TO- I LIKE THE FACT THAT CDCR LIKE OTHER STATE ENTITIES- IS REQUIRED TO EITHER BE VACCINATED OR EXCUSE ME DA INDIVIDUALS MUST SUBMIT THEMSELVES TO TESTING SO IT'S NOT A 100% VACCINATION MANDATE- THE CITIES ARE LIKE OTHER DEPARTMENTS- MUST. EITHER HAVE TO PROVIDE PROOF OF VACCINATION OR SUBMIT TO- A REGULAR TESTING SO JUST TO CLARIFY THAT POINT- AND YES IT THE NUMBERS ARE JUST HOVERING ABOVE 70% FOR CCC OUR STAFF JUST ABOVE 80% FOR I'M INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS- BUT YEAH WE CONTINUE TO AS AN ADMINISTRATION ENCOURAGE MORE VACCINATION AND IN LIEU OF THAT WEEK. WE REQUIRE THE TESTING. WHAT WOULD WELL IF I JUST ASK- BASED ON YOUR YOUR EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY FOR US TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR- THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. TESTING AND VACCINATION THE NEED FOR THESE INVESTMENTS ON ON ONGOING BASIS- YEAH I. SORRY I'M GETTING FEEDBACK NOW THE CHAMBER- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THAT DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES DOES- COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AND NOT JUST FOR CDC ARE BUT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ENCOURAGE- MORE COMPLIANCE IN REGARDS BUT BACKING AND PROTESTING- BEAT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT WE ARE REQUESTING FOR THE CURRENT YEAR ARE LARGELY IN PART DUE TO THE ARCHON. ADDITIONALLY DALTON I'M A CRIME VARIANT AND- BEING ABLE TO PIVOT QUICKLY TO ADDRESS THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST. IN- IN IN OUR PRISONS DEPARTMENT OF THE HR FROM MY AT THE YOU FOR. MANAGE THANK M. SENATOR COURT CASE- WE HAVE. CENTER PAN FULLER BY CENTER DRAWS FOLLOWED BY SENATOR. FOLLOWED BY SENATOR. NIELSEN AGHOLOR- SENATOR PM RIGHT THANK YOU FOR VERY MUCH AND. WE APPRECIATE PRESENTATION DIRECTOR LEE- APPRECIATE THE- WHAT WOULD IN TERMS- PROVIDING- THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE MEANWHILE I'M SURE PEOPLE. AREN'T COMING TO WORK SICK- BRINGING CODED INTO THE WORKPLACE- POTENTIALLY EXPOSING CUSTOMERS OR OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL SO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WERE RESTORING THAT- BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE IT DID HAVE A FEW ABOUT BUDGET BILL JUNIOR SO FIRST OF ALL- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR THE PROPANE ONE POINT SIX BILLION TO JUMP ON TO THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH. THE THERE'S ABOUT WELL ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THREE HUNDRED NINE NINE POINT ONE MILLION FOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION- I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WHERE THINGS WERE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO INCREASE OUR RATE OF- VACCINATIONS INCLUDING PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNGER PEOPLE WHICH AND FORTY RIGHT NOW IS REALLY LOW I MEAN WE'RE TALKING LIKE YOU KNOW TWENTY SOME PERCENT 23% AT BEST- ARE IN TERMS OF THOSE FUNDS- A PORTION OF THOSE ARE. ACTUALLY GONNA BE. TOWARD ACTUALLY INCREASING ACCESS TO VACCINES TO THROUGH. I'M A CARE OFFICES PHYSICIANS OFFICES AND SO FORTH- I THINK YOU KNOW THE PEDIATRICIAN- SOMETHING I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT- THERE ARE MAYBE FAMILIES WHO AREN'T SURE WHETHER ABOUT THE VACCINE. AND THEY WILL ASK SOME QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE CHILD VACCINATED THAT'S WHAT THEY'D PREFER TO GO TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE THAT A AFTER ALL WHERE THEIR CHILDREN GOT ALL THEIR OTHER VACCINES. SO WHEN IT COMES TO VACCINE DISTRIBUTION MINISTRATION WHAT PORTION OF THAT. COUNTRY THREE HUNDRED NINE NINE MILLION IS ACTUALLY GOING TO INCREASE- AVAILABILITY VACCINATIONS THROUGH- ESSENTIALLY PRIMARY CARE SITES- PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW DOCTOR'S OFFICE OF THE PRIMARY CARE OFFICES. YES SENATOR PAT I DON'T HAVE THAT RESPONSE BUT I WILL SEE IF ANYBODY ON THE LINE PERHAPS AND DORSEY HAS SOME INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO HOW MUCH OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. FOR VACCINATIONS WOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS PRIMARY CARE OFFICES. GOOD MORNING MRS THAT CATHARINE CLARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT- FUNDING GOING TOWARDS HER BACK FOR THE NATION'S BY THE PRIMARY CARE- LOCATION HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT- BE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRAFTED. THE TOTAL MONEY MOBILE FOR VACCINATION- IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE TOTAL REQUEST IS ACTUALLY- AROUND OF THE TOTAL LEVEL IS FIVE HUNDRED AND- FORTY EIGHT. MILLION MUSICIANS AMOUNT REQUESTED IS THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE MILLION. AND I'VE THE TOTAL FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AT THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION IS ALLOCATED FOR- OUT REACH AND SUPPORT. AND ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILLION MORE VACCINATIONS BY AND- MOBILE BACK INSIDE. CERTAINLY WE CAN. GET BACK TO WITH THE- SOME AMOUNTS GOING TOWARD CARE LOCATION. OKAY THAT THAT WOULD BE HELP- BECAUSE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT SIR AGAIN WE'VE OVER SITE WITHIN THE OF DIFFERENT BUT WE'RE A WALL ON BACKS AND RATES AND SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH. THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW. PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO GO TO SOMEONE THEY ALREADY KNOW ORDER USED TO GETTING THE VACCINES AND THAT. TOO BECAUSE CHILDREN. AND IF WE'RE NOT DELIVERING THEM AND THOSE SITES- WERE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED BECAUSE THEY- MAY NOT WANT TO GO TO A PLACE WHERE WELL MAYBE THE PERSON CAN ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. THAT'S NOT THE PERSON WHO THEY WANT TO. THE DAY- YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH SO I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE LOOK AT THAT IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET A VACCINATION RATES UP. NO FRANKLY FOR MYSELF. I KNOW WHAT THE VALUE VACCINE IS I JUST TAKE MY CHILD TO A YOU KNOW TO A TO A MASS VACCINATION SITE OR PHARMACY OR WHATEVER THAT'S FINE BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF OTHER FAMILIES WHO DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT SO- SO HOPEFULLY WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THAT- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE. IS- A NOTE THAT- IS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION ALL FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE POINT TWO MILLION SO. IS ROUNDING UP A LITTLE BIT. FOR STATEWIDE TESTING. AND I GUESS THIS QUESTION IS RELATED TO- ELSE CERTAINLY SCHOOLS HAVE TO DO ARE YOU KNOW. DOING A LOT OF TESTING TO KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN- AND- I UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE'S FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WENT TO THE SCHOOLS. THROUGH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. BUT THAT SEVERAL FUNDING- ACTUALLY EXPIRES IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO PERHAPS BECAUSE THAT'S JUNE AND THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THIS YEAR STARTING JULY PERHAPS MEDIO DRESS IN THE MAIN BUDGET. BUT I AM CURIOUS AS TO- IN TERMS OF FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS WHETHER ANY OF THE STATEWIDE TESTING MONEY IS ALSO FOR SCHOOLS OR ARE WE ACTUALLY ON. A WEAK SEATING EARLIER UNDER IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT FOR SCHOOL TESTING. IN TERMS OF THE SPENDING AND- AND A REAL DISSIPATING WE'RE GONNA NEED TO PUT MORE FUNDING OR WE GET MORE FEDERAL FUNDING SINCE THE EXISTING FUNDING ENDS IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO I KNOW WHETHER ANY OF THIS STATEWIDE TESTING FUNDS. IS TO AUGMENT THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO SCHOOLS OR PERHAPS SCHOOLS ARE NOT SPENDING ALL THAT MONEY SO WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT BUT WE'LL BE ADDRESSING THAT AND- ACTED IN FIRST- SO PERHAPS CAN GIVE ME AN UPDATE AS TO WHERE WE ARE. ON SCHOOL TED FUNDING FOR SCHOOL TESTING- THAT- I THINK IT WAS GIVEN THROUGH THE NIELSEN GRANT MECHANISM SO THAT WE CAN KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN. OUR TO LEARN IT GO AHEAD. SORRY I CAN'T BE PARKING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M WE CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK TO YOU WITH THAT THE BREAK OUT OF SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN FUN I'M I AM THE- RESOURCES POLITICS ARE ALL- WE DO HAVE A EIGHT AND NINETY NINE AND- BE FINE- UP FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED FOR PASSING. AND THERE ARE AND BE AT THE HAVE BEEN- REQUEST THAT YOU AT TESTING AND AT LIKE THAT WE WERE HAPPY PROVIDE BREAK UP YOU OKAY YES YOU COULD GET BACK TO THEM I WILL BE SURE HAVE ENOUGH FUN FIRST TESTING KEEPERS OPEN RIGHT AND- SO I KNOW THEY WERE FEDERAL. I DON'T KNOW IS FOR EXAMPLE ARE WE ABOUT HOW IS THAT IT WAS AND MONEY WAS THAT ENOUGH AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE TO PUT SOME THAT MIGHT TO. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT WE TRACK RATE BECAUSE THEY ALL THAT'S GOING TO THEN IF HOME WE MIGHT NEED TO BUDGET. IN YOU KNOW FOR THE- IT'S FOR THE MAIN BUDGETS. IN JULY. BECAUSE IF THIS FEDERAL FUNDING ENDS ON JUNE TWO. TWENTY TWO- WE NEED TO KNOW. WAS THAT AND- IS THAT NOT ENOUGH HOW MUCH WE'RE GET THE BUDGET. SUB THE- TO. INSURE THAT WE KEEP OUR SCHOOL OPEN. AND- AS MUCH AS SOMETHING WOULD WISH IT AND CERTAINLY I. WISH BUT I. WE ALL. IS THE CODES. GOING TO. SO WE NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT. FOR A SCHOOL. TEST TO ENSURE THAT- CAN KEEP OUR SCHOOLS. AND SO I APPRECIATED I CAN GET BACK SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND. IF ANY OF THIS. NOW ARE WE HAD A BEHIND AND IF WE'RE ARE BEHIND YOU KNOW HAT PORTION OF THE- FIVE HUNDRED NIGHT. NIGHT NOT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE POINT TWO MILLION WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BE SURE WE AUGMENT SCHOOL. FUNDING FOR SCHOOL TESTING TO ENSURE THAT- THE SUFFICIENT TESTING. THE KEEPER SCHOOLS OPEN THANK YOU. IN CENTER OF HANNAH ANDERSON TO NOTE THAT THE CURRENT. BUDGET ACTS. DOES INCLUDE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SO THAT. HI MY NAME IS THAT ON TOP OF THAT. AND TO ACTIVISTS. OR THE- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION FOR STATEWIDE TESTING WE'LL GET TO THE BREAKDOWN OF REGARDS TO YOUR QUESTION BUT JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT- INVESTMENT FOR STATEWIDE TESTING THAT ARE INCLUDED IN. THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET YOUR AXE. YEAH AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T PUT SUFFICIENT HASN'T PUT SIGNIFICANT MONEY QUESTIONS HOW MUCH ARE OF IT WERE EXPANDING. SO THERE'S THIS IS THE OVERSIGHT PART AND I THINK IT'S OUR- IS S. AS MY GOOD FRIENDS ARE CORTESE LIKE. WHAT OKAY FINE WE HAVE MONEY. HOW MUCH OF IT WE SPENDING THERE HOW MUCH WHAT WE NEED. GOING INTO THE FUTURE SO. THAT'S REALLY THE THRUST OF THE QUESTION IS NOT THAT. WE HAVEN'T BUDGETED. DIVISIONS YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF TIMES WE JUST DON'T KNOW IS THAT SUFFICIENT IS IT. MORE IS IT LASTS YOU KNOW WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW. AND SO THEREFORE AND- BECAUSE THESE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS. THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIND THANK YOU. THANK YOU A DOCTOR PAN. WE WILL NOW TURN TO SENATOR. THANK YOU MAN CHAIR OF IDEA FULLY SUPPORT ALL THE BILLS BEFORE US TODAY I THINK THEY'RE ALL IN COMBINATION VERY IMPORTANT FORUM FOR OUR STATE- AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE- THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY EFFICIENT AND IMPORTANT WAY OF. STOPPING OR THE SPREAD OR SLOWING DOWN THE SPREAD OF COALBED IS- HOW WORKING MEN AND WOMEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY HOME THE RIGHT TO STAY HOME AND STILL NOT LOSE THEIR PAY- I WILL JUST RAISE UP AN OLD NOT A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR BUDGET STAFF. ON HOW DO WE PROVIDE THE SAME ECONOMIC RELIEF OFFER SMALLER BUSINESSES UNDER TWENTY SIX- EMPLOYEES- I THINK THOUGH THEY ARE THE ONES I THINK THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN GREAT GREAT NEED- AND CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THEM. ARE IN GREAT NEED- WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS- ALL THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES UNDER THE AND YET THEY MAKE UP ALL TOGETHER ABOUT FOUR MILLION WORKERS SO- I THINK WE NEED TO BE MORE EXPLICIT AND TARGETED WITH THE ECONOMIC RELIEF FOR THE BUSINESSES AS MUCH AS- THE- WORK MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK FOR THEM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DRUGS SO- I MAYBE MAKING SOME COMMENTS ON ON SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN- BUT I'LL WAIT TILL I HAVE OTHER SENATORS WHO AFTER. MIKE'S UP- AND I HAVE A SENATOR CAFIERO FOLLOWED BY SENATOR NIELSEN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR COM LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I TOO WILL BE SUPPORTING ALL OF A- THESE ITEMS AND- WANT I. REALLY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE TO HAVE THIS EARLY ACTION IS REALLY IMPORTANT I DO HAVE A- ONE ISSUE. THAT ARE HAS BEEN RAISED TO ME AND I FRANKLY HAD JUST DIDN'T CATCH IT- IT IS ON AB EIGHTY SEVEN N. AND THIS IS THE- THIS IS THE M. THE BILL THAT WOULD- DO A NUMBER OF THINGS AND IN TERMS OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM. PUMP AS AS EVERYBODY WILL REMEMBER WE DID DO SOME TAX CONFORMITY WITH THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT IN REGARDS TO- MAKING SURE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT. RECEIVED RELIEF. FROM FROM OUR GRANT PROGRAM OR RELIEF BECAUSE OF OUR GRANT PROGRAM OR THE FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT THEY WOULD BE TAX BECAUSE OF. ON TOP OF THAT THOSE GRANT PROGRAMS- THIS BILL BASICALLY LEAVES A GAP- AND THE GAP IS BETWEEN MARCH. OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO JUNE OF TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO IF YOU GOT A GRANT- EITHER FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT- OURS OUR GRANDFATHERS WERE LOANS- YOU HAD TO PAY TAXES YOU HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON THEM AND SO- WE DID TAX CONFORMITY BUT WE DID IT. BEFORE THAT FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT EXTENDED THEIR PROGRAM AND SO WE'VE LEFT THE GAP BECAUSE OF THIS BILL AND I JUST WANT TO IDENTIFY IT- WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO FIX IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE. OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO RECOVER AGAIN AND OF HAVING TO PAY IF YOU IF YOU WERE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO GET THE GRANT BETWEEN. MARCH AND JUNE OF LAST YEAR THAN THEN. YOU DO NOT HAVE TAX CONFORMITY SO I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT FOR THE RECORD AND SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WANNA RESPOND AT ALL. I JUST APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION I WILL TAKE THAT BACK THANK YOU SENATOR CABALLERO. RIGHT SENATOR KABIR DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE NO THANK YOU MANAGER I'M GOOD. OUR SENATOR NELSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU KNOW I. THE MOST TO VOTE NO ON MOLLY'S PROVISIONS. TO GET A LITTLE BIT WARY OF THE ADMINISTRATION USURPING LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY OF COMPROMISING THE PROCESS. IN RUNNING GOVERNMENT BY EXECUTIVE ORDER AND NO BID CONTRACTS. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CAME IN WITH THE LATE EDITION. THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO THOROUGHLY REVIEW. IT'S FORGIVENESS OF THESE CERTAIN LOANS. AND THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS ONE POINT NINE BILLION. MORE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FINANCES THAT THE ONLY WRITTEN AMOUNT OF RISK THAT- THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT ONE POINT NINE BILLION. AND WOULD YOU HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE YOU MEANING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR. TWO SIX SECURE FUNDING AUTHORITY ARE YOU JUST ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE THAT AUTHORITY TODAY DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT HAVE THAT AUTHORITY TODAY. SEVEN METERN INSTEAD I THINK IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE- THE LANGUAGE THAT PROVIDES- A CASH FLOW LOAN YEAH. LOOK OKAY- WITHIN THAT THE LANGUAGE THERE IS- A CLAUSE THAT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOAN FORGIVENESS SHOULD THE FEDERAL FUNDS. NOT COME IN WITHIN. WHEN HE SO THE END OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THE BILL HAS THE AUTHORITY APARTMENT TO PROVIDE LOANS FOR STATE LOCAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE. BUT THE BILL DOESN'T INCLUDE AN APPROPRIATION WHEN WILL THAT APPROPRIATIONS BE PUT INTO THE BUDGET. SECRETARY RETIRED CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU WELL I WE CAN ALSO ASK THE LEDGE ANALYST OR MAYBE THE CONTROLLER. BUT THESE LOANS ON LOAN AND I'M SORRY I THANK I CAN BE A TO ADDRESS THAT I WAS TO HEARING THE REST OF YOUR- BUT I BELIEVE YOU'RE ASKING AGAIN ABOUT THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE. PROGRAM AND JUST THIS IS A CASH FLOW LOAN AND SO THERE THERE ISN'T AN APPROPRIATION REQUIRED AT THIS MOMENT- I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REALLOCATED FUNDS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. IT'S A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM THAT-ABOUT- THAT WAS CREATED AS PART OF- FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGES AND WE CONTINUE TO- ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE AS WELL AS LOCALS TO PROVIDE US FINE. I'M SORRY. THIS LONG IS A FOR. TO A THESE TO CONTINUE THAT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE LOCAL LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS CAN CONTINUE TO PURSUE PAYMENT. WELL YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS. WHAT ASSURANCE DO WE HAVE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO COME THROUGH WITH ANY FUNDING I DON'T THINK WE DO WHERE YOU'RE MAKING GROSS ASSUMPTIONS HERE. AND THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE FEDERAL MONEY. WHO IS A BLIGE OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY DOES NOT COME TO COVER THE LOANS THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED WHERE WILL THAT MONEY COME FROM. AGAIN THIS IS A CASH FLOW LOAN TO BRIDGE THAT WE CONTINUE TO SPEAK WITH- THE TREASURY WE HAVE- A MULTI STATE LETTER. TO FOR THEIR SUPPORT I REQUEST AS WELL AS OUR TWO U. S. SENATORS- SO WE ARE PUSHING AGGRESSIVELY FOR. THROUGH A FEDERAL ADVOCACY FOR THOSE FUNDS. WELL IT'S A PART OF THE GAMESMANSHIP THAT DOES BECOME RAMPANT NOW IN OUR BUDGET FOR A LOT OF THE SENATE HAPPENED OVER MANY YEARS. IT'S JUST THAT I'M GETTING A LITTLE TIRED OF IT GENERAL WOULD NOT COUNT AS A GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE. BUT WE'VE GOT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS THE DRESS CARE. WE MIGHT NOT GET IT BACK. CAN'T THAT MAKE MUCH THAT NOT BE CONSIDERED AN EXPENDITURE ORDER YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS THAT YOUR WAY OF THE GROUND THE BEGAN LIMIT OR SOMETHING IS THAT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRYING TO DO SKATE THE GAMUT. NO SENATOR- IT BECAUSE IT IS A CASH ALONE IT IS NOT CONSIDERED APPROPRIATIONS SAID THAT LONG BEFORE GIVEN IN THE FUTURE THAT THE ALLOCATION WOULD OCCUR AT THAT TIME. PLEASE DO NOT FEEL THAT THIS IS A PERSONAL ONE IN ANY WAY. AND THAT'S HAPPENED OVER MANY YEARS AND I'VE PROBABLY HAD TO DEAL WITH MORE THAN MOST BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HERE A LOT OF YEARS. BUT I'M GETTING WARY OF IT. AND I GET A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSER FOR US IN MY COMPLAINT. ABOUT AND WE JUST DON'T KNOW IT'S A BLANK CHECK. IN THE GOVERNOR USURPED AUTHORITY ALL THE TIME. WHEN ARE SOME OF THESE EMERGENCY POWERS GOING TO BE EXTINGUISHED IF THE- VILLA SHOWS THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES HE EMERGENCY POWERS. THAT COULD EXTEND INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THAT'S A LONG TIME OFF SO IS THE GOVERNOR GOING TO EVER IT EXTINGUISH THE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY THERE'S A AND WHAT IS HIS PLAN. YEAH I WOULD JUST POINT TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR EARLY ACTION ON KOBE IT AS AN EXAMPLE WELL WHICH WAS- BUT INITIALLY WE HAD A FORTY THROUGH- STATUTE THROUGH JERRY ELLIS STATUTES TO. SPEND AND OUT OF THE- AS OF THE U. WE FIVE NO LONGER HAVE THAT AUTHORITY NO LONGER THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THAT TRIO UP FRONT AND SO AS AN EXAMPLE WE ARE COMING BEFORE. THE LEGISLATURE TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO ASK FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL FINES- THROUGH THE CONTROL SECTION WE ALSO HAVE- A MEASURE OF AN ABILITY TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE HAVE A TEN DAY NOTIFICATION TO THE GLVC BEFORE WE CAN EXPAND THE SPOT. SO JUST TO POINT OUT SOME OF THAT. THE BALANCE THERE. WE FORM DOES IT TAKE BUDGET BUT- AT THE FOR BRINGS FOR. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE THROUGH A JAIL LET. AND SO THAT WOULD BE A EDUCATION STUDER- THE FIRE TO THE EXPENDITURE OF A OF THOSE FINE FOR WHICH WERE OUT FOR- IN THE IN CURRENT YEAR. WELL THE GUN SEEMS TO HAVE A- PENSION FOR NOBODY CONTRACTS. AND I THAT'S A BIT OF A- IS A BIT OF BECAUSE IT'S BECOMING. A COMMON. N. I AM INFORMED THAT EIGHTY TWO MILLION APPROPRIATED HERE FOR THE TROUBLED BLANCHARD BRANCH TESTING LABORATORY WILL NEXT FIVE MONTHS TO CONTINUE THE MONTH TO MONTH THE FUNDING. THIS NO BID CONTRACT- THE COMPANY CALLED PERKINS ELMER. NOW INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND PERKINS OUR HAVING BEEN OUT OF COMPLIANCE. THE LABORATORY RULES STATE AND FEDERAL. AND THAT I'VE BEEN INFORMED THAT THEIR CHECK CHEAPER AND QUICKER TESTING ALTERNATIVES THAT EXIST. IT ARE YOU LOOKING AT THOSE OTHER OPTIONS OR WE JUST GONNA CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH WITH THE CONTRACT WITH PERKINS ELMER. WHAT ARE THE CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THE CONTROL TO FINANCING POSES TO ENSURE THAT. SERVICES ARE DELIVERED. YES AND AT A HIGH LEVEL AGAIN THAT'S- THAT CONTRACT MAY BE TERMINATED WITH- I BELIEVE SIXTY DAYS NOTICE PROP THIRTY DAYS NOTICE- IN REGARDS TO THEIR PERFORMANCE SO THERE IS THAT MEASURE OF. ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THE STATE HAS BUT I WILL TURNS QUESTION NUMBER FOR MORE DETAILS TO- AS FAR. THANK YOU I THINK ON OF THE- FINANCE LET ME NO ONE ALLOW- WE ARE IN THE- BY LOOKING AT ALTERNATE- THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS CURRENTLY LOOKING AT HIGHLAND- PROGRAM WITH THE OF CALIFORNIA- BUT TO THIS POINT- LONG IS ACROSS COME. OF OUR PROGRAM. EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC BY J. WHEN OUR STRETCH- BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE Y. WERE CONTENDING FOR SCARE RESOURCES. AND ALLOW. ALLOWED US. INTRO ARE OWN TESTING. THAT THE STATE NOT A PART WHO IS UNIQUELY. TO ADDRESS ONGOING SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. THE VENDOR PERKINELMER WAS SELECTED BECAUSE TEY HAVE THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT AND WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN HAS INTENSIFIED. NUMBER CONTROL OVER THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND GUARANTEEING THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE ALL NECESSARY COMPONENTS FOR TESTING. ONE PILL LABORATORY HAS INCREASED TESTING AVAILABILITY AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AT HIGHER RISK THAN CONCRETE CARE SETTING. AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SO THEY WITH- A CRANBERRY AND THE DAILY CASE RATE INCREASE- TESTING VOLUMES CONTINUE TO BE HIGH ANOTHER ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE LAB CONTINUES- BUT AGAIN AS WE ARE STILL EXPLORING ALTERNATIVES- BUT AT THIS AT THIS STAGE YEAH LEVEL ONCE THE LAB IS STILL A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE TESTING PROGRAM CONTAINS EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW CONTRACT TRACING EFFORTS. INCLUDING A NEW PROGRAM TO DIVERT EXISTING STAFF STATIC STATE P. WISE I GATHER THAT WHAT THAT WHAT THAT AMOUNTS TO PERSONAL YEARS STATE STAFF TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESERVE CORPS HOW EFFECTIVE RICHEST CONTRACT TRACING AT STOPPING THE PREAD OF COLON ARE YOU LOOKING INTO THAT IS IT WORTH EVEN CONTINUING THIS EFFORT- HOW DO YOU THEN HAVE PROTOCOLS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. AND IF IT'S NOT WORKING TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT OVER THEIR PENALTIES TO THE CONTRACTOR IF THEY DON'T DELIVER. AGAIN I RECORD FROM THE FINANCE AS A CONTACT THEME- INITIATIVE FOR EIGHTEEN MILLION IS FOR A VOLUNTEER STATE- RESERVE CORPS AND THE FINAL FOR THIS PROGRAM THAT WOULD ONLY BE UTILIZED IF THEIR WIVES- I NEED TO- TO INITIATERSU ACTIVATED FOR THEIR CAR SO IF. THERE IS NOT A NEED. FIND GOOD RESULT IN SAVING- SO IT IS CONTINGENT UPON THE NECESSITY FOR CONTACTING. JUST DO A GENERAL QUESTION IS PROBABLY BETTER SERVED WITH GENERAL SERVICES WHO I THINK PRIMARILY THE CONTRACTING BUT- DO OUR CONTRACTS WITH VENDORS HAVE DELIVERABLES. TIME CERTAIN SCHEDULES FOR DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND OR PENALTIES AGAINST THE CONTRACTOR IF THEY DO NOT DELIVER. TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY OF THESE CONTRACTS. HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION KEEP TRACK- YES SENATOR ALFIE BROADLY IN REGARDS TO PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTS GENERALLY THAT THERE ARE OFTEN DELIVERABLE BASED CONTRACTS THAT THAT THE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES ARE AND OR OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE HOLDING OF THOSE PROCUREMENTS WITHIN THOSE CONTRACTS WITH OF VENDORS GENERALLY HAVE- MILESTONES THAT NEED TO BE MAD OR AT SOME SORT OF DELIVERABLE I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC CONTRACT THAT- MISS CLARK WAS TALKING ABOUT BUT GENERALLY IF THAT IS THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE HAVE. AT THE STATE LEVEL TO- ENSURED THAT WE ARE GETTING WHAT WE- ARE IN A PENALTY. IF THEY DIDN'T DELIVER AGAIN PART TO DIFFERENTLY THERE MY BE A FINE PLANNER PENALTY OR SOMEWHERE HOLD WITH. CAME BUT THAT'S THAT'S AGAIN GEN- EACH CAR. IS TO BASED ON THE NEEDS BUT THAT STATE AS IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THE IT'S- IT'S OFTEN IN REGARDS TO HOW WE CAN- INCENT BETTER PERFORMANCE FROM THE SENATE. WELL JUST FOR THE MOMENT ALLOW TO OBSERVE. I BELIEVE THE PER SHOULD BE RIGHT INDIGNANT AND CONCERNED IN THE PRESS SHOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY. CONCERNED ABOUT THE SECRETIVE GOVERNMENT THAT WE NOW HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE AGENCIES OF STATE GOVERNMENT AND HOW THEY RUN ROUGHSHOD AND HOW DO WE BUILD OUR BUDGETS IN A LOT OF TIMES IT HAPPENS AT THE LAST MINUTE WITH THE LEGISLATURE BARELY GET. THE TIME TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE IT COMES TO US AND WE JUST HAVE TO ASSUME. I DON'T THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS THAT WAY. THAT PROBABLY THE GREATEST EXAMPLE OF WHERE WE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE SQUANDERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ONE OF WHICH IS HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT THE BIGGEST IS TO HIGH TECH WE'VE HAD TO INTERRUPT AND SIT AROUND AND TWIDDLE OUR THUMBS. WHILE COMMUNICATION HAD TO BE. TOWED UP I GUESS. TO ME THAT'S REALLY AN EMBARRASSMENT TO SERVE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND HAVE TO BE SITTING AROUND HERE WELL TECH PEOPLE COME SWARMING IN THE- SIX JUST TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE. REMOTE OR IN ANY OTHER WAY. AND THEN WHEN DID WE GET INTO THESE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR. EXPENDITURES LIKE FISCAL. AND THE CREATION BURKE. EDT YOU NAME IT OVER THE DECADES- BEEN SEVERAL. I JUST ADMONISHED THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. EXERT A LOT MORE OVERSIGHT. AND IMPOSE A LOT MORE CONSEQUENCES IF WE CANNOT LEAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ADMINISTRATION THEN THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT GET IT RIGHT. THANK YOU I'M SENATOR NELSON I HAVE SENATOR COM LOGGER AND SENATOR DOLLY ON THE LIST I'M GONNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS BEFORE I CALLING YOU BOTH THEN WE WILL IF I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER MIKES UP WE WILL THEN GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. SO THAT WE CAN MANAGE TO VOTE BEFORE- ARE TWELVE THIRTY DEADLINE- COUPLE OF POINTS I JUST WANT TO MAKE. THE CLEARLY- OF I SURE NIELSEN HEARINGS LIKE THIS OR THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR YOU AND ALL OF US TO MAKE OUR VIEWS KNOWN WHICH YOU- YOU DID HI AND THE BUT I DID WANT TO NOTE ONE KEY THING IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THE EXPENDITURES AND THEIR RELATED TO COPE IT. THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE JAIL BC- PROCESS HOWEVER AS THE LEGISLATURE WE AND BOTH HOUSES WE BASICALLY SAID NO THEY SHOULD GO THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS THEY SHOULD HAVE A HEARING SUCH AS THIS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE VETTED BY OUR LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES ARE STAFF AND OF COURSE THE PUBLIC AND THAT IS WHY. WE HAVE THE BEFORE US AND WHY WE HAVE THIS HEARING BUT WHAT I WOULD NOTE IS THAT IN RELATIONSHIP TO A STATE OF EMERGENCY. WE ARE CURRENTLY AT. OR IT.PER DAY. COVERT DATA AS- AS WE DID A YEAR AGO. SO FOR ANYONE TO IMAGINE THAT WE ARE NOT IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY STILL FROM THIS PANDEMIC WHILE WE ARE ALL TIRED OF IT AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE STILL IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE. AS I SAID. THAT WERE ABOVE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS PER DAY IN THE STATE AS WE DID A YEAR AGO. SO I THINK ALL OF US WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR WE CONTINUE TO BE AS SMART. AROUND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PROTOCOLS TO MINIMIZE THOSE DEATHS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT WHETHER IT'S BUSINESSES ARE STATE AGENCIES ARE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AND IN RELATIONSHIP TO- FUNDING FOR SUCH THINGS AS CDCR WHILE I WOULD- HOPE THAT WE GOT TO THE POINT. IF WE LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE THE U. S. MILITARY WHERE- THERE'S NOW CONSEQUENCES TO THOSE- MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT VACCINATED. THAT WE MIGHT GET TO SUCH ACIRCUMSTANCE IN OUR OWN AMONGST MANY OF OUR OWN STAFF ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT SERVE CONGREGATE SETTINGS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY. THEY ARE PUTTING THE. THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS BUT WE ARE IN THIS CASE ADDRESSING IT WITH TESTING AND CONTINUED- PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT ALSO AND THEN I WANTED TO ADD ON THE- ISSUES OF THE ASSISTANT STORE LANDLORDS IN OUR TENANTS. IT IS YOUR ACCURATE THAT THE WE ARE NOT GUARANTEED THAT WE WILL RECEIVE THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE HOPE HOWEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAS MADE IT CLEAR BOTH IN THE INITIATION OF THE PROGRAM AND SUBSEQUENTLY THAT. IN THEY MADE AN INITIAL ALLOCATION TO STATES BUT THAT THEY WOULD BE SWEEPING THE UNSPENT MONEY FOR MANY STATES WHO DID NOT SPEND THEIR MONEY AND RE ALLOCATING AND WE ALREADY KNOW IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED PUBLICLY THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATES A GOOD NUMBER THAT DID NOT SPEND THEIR FULL AMOUNTS OR SOME CASE VERY LITTLE. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE REDISTRIBUTING THAT AND GIVEN THE NUMBER OF THE LANDLORDS AND TENANTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO QUALIFY FOR THAT PROGRAM IN WHO HAVE SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS WE NEED TO DO OUR VERY VERY BEST. TO PURSUE GETTING THAT MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT THAT BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED TO SEE EITHER OUR SMALL SMALL LANDLORDS HURT. DUE TO LACK OF THE ABILITY OF THEIR TENANTS TO PAY NOR DO WE NEED TO SEE A LOT OF EVICTIONS OCCUR. ON AT SOME POINT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN THE STATE. SO I WANTED TO MAKE JUST A COUPLE OF THOSE POINTS I HAD SOME OTHERS I WANTED TO MAKE AROUND SMALL BUSINESSES- BUT I- BECAUSE I DO NOTE- SENATOR DRUGS IS CONCERNED THAT. WHILE IT I THINK WE HAD IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS AROUND MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS NOT JUST THE ONES THAT ARE BEFORE US TODAY WE OFTEN EXEMPT THE SMALL EMPLOYERS. FROM BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE KIND OF REVENUE IN GENERAL THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE AND SO. THEY HAVE LESS ABILITY PERHAPS TO COVER THE TYPES OF COSTS THAT MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT A VERY LARGE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS DO ARE EMPLOYED BY SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THEY NEED THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE PAID SICK LEAVE TO AND YET IN THIS CASE WERE NOT NECESSARILY MANDATING IT BUT- WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN THE MOST HARDEST HIT. BY THE ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS PANDEMIC SO ARE WHILE OUR AND DO ACTIONS BEFORE US INCLUDE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION MORE. FOR THE GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES WE MAY WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHER VERY TARGETED PROGRAMS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. TO ASSESS BOTH THE EMPLOYEES AND OF SMALL BUSINESS AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES THEMSELVES AND WE'RE TALKING NOW THE VERY SMALL ONES. MEANING THE TWENTY FIVE OR LESS. THAT IN MANY CASES WE'VE ACCEPTED FROM THINGS BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT SINCE THE DATA SHOWS THAT THERE'D BEEN SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT. SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT CLEARLY YOU'RE ALL OF VIEW HAVE START THE BUDGET SEPT HEARINGS YOU'RE DEALING WITH LOTS OF THESE. ISSUES AND TODAY'S JUST NEARLY ACTIONS BUT I WILL BE QUIET NOW. AND RECOGNIZE SENATOR COM MARKER FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DOLLY AND THEN WE WILL GO TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT GO AHEAD CENTER COMPLEX. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AM I. IN THANK YOU FOR THOSE. COMMENTS THAT YOU SHARED WITH US. I TOO WILL BE- SUPPORTING THE- ITEMS BEFORE US WHEN IT IS TIME- FOR THE VOTES- LATER ON. THEY LATER ON I WANTED TO JUST SORT OF GO BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY DR PAN ABOUT. IN NEW ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW WE'VE HIT A WALL- WITH VACCINATION RATES BUT WE'VE HIT A WALL FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS- AND- ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'VE HAD A WALL IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TIRED. YOU KNOW PATIENTS AND WORKERS AND FAMILIES ARE BURNED OUT THEY'RE OVERWHELMED THEY ARE TIRED. AND SO IT IS GREAT THAT WE ARE PUTTING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS INTO YOU KNOW TESTING AN OUT REACH AND BOOSTERS AND EQUIPMENT IT IS GREAT THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING ARM PAID SICK LEAVE. I ALSO HOPE THAT WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ECONOMIC RELIEF WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT SHOULD ALSO BE TRANSLATING INTO PSYCHOLOGICAL. RELIEF IF PEOPLE ARE BURNED OUT IF THEY ARE DEALING WITH DEPRESSION IF THEY ARE CHECKING OUT IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. THEN WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT OF HOW TO FACE. AS IT RELATES TO HOW SMALL BUSINESSES STAY OPEN HOW IT RELATES TO WORKERS WANTING TO SHOW UP AND GO TO WORK AS IT RELATES TO YOUNG PEOPLE WANTING TO SHOW UP AND GO TO SCHOOL- SO I AM HOPING THAT SOMEHOW SOME WAY WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RELIEF AND COLD WOULD RELIEVE. THAT WE ARE INSERTING YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH. AND OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT WILL REQUIRE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING GOOD. ABOUT WORKING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC THAT WE ARE STILL IN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR COM ORDER I'M- I DON'T WANT TO PRESUME BUT I'M ASSUMING YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT A RESPONSE FROM NOT JUST YOU WANTED TO PUT IT ON THERE AND I WANTED TO PUT IT ON THE RECORD WE HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH CAN I HAVE A BUSINESS OPEN IF NOBODY SHOWING UP BECAUSE THEY'VE CHECKED OUT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES AS WELL CERTAINLY THANK YOU. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I DO HAVE A QUESTION I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE- BUDGET BILL JUNIOR AND- SO WE'VE APPROPRIATED THE PROPOSAL IS TO APPROPRIATE ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. AND. SENATOR NELSON ASKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE RATE RELIEF I WANT I AND THIS IS GOING TO GO TO COUNTIES AND THE AND THEY'RE GONNA DISTRIBUTE OUT AND IF IT DOESN'T GET. WE DON'T GET PAID BACK BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS AND THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE APPROPRIATIONS IF THAT. DOESN'T HAPPEN AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN. MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE AMOUNT. THAT WE KNOW. IS ONE POINT NINE BILLION THE AMOUNT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS THE AMOUNT YOU'RE WILLING TO GO. AND PAY AND RISK TO THE GENERAL FUND I THAT YOU KNOW. THERE'S NO DETAIL AND WHAT THE AMOUNT IS. WHAT IS THAT AMOUNT. ARE YOU SENATORS SO THE ONE POINT NINE BILLION THAT SENATOR NIELSEN MENTIONED IS A NUMBER THAT WE HAVE. REQUESTED OF THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE TREASURY- IN REGARDS THE REALITIES YOU KNOW DOLLARS THAT- SENATOR SKINNER- PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. ARE THERE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERUSED UNSPENT BY OTHER STATES AND THE TREASURY- HAS A REALLOCATION PROCESS FOR THOSE UNSPENT DOLLARS AND SO AS WE- CONTINUE OUR ADVOCACY THE ONE POINT NINE BILLION IS. WHAT WE HAVE ASKED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- NEXT TO- MEET THE NEEDS OF ELIGIBLE. FEATURES AND LANDMARKS. SO IS THAT THE CAP ONE POINT NINE IS WHAT. IS THE CAPITAL. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO AS WELL AS YOU SAY. YOU KNOW THIS IS IT IS A LONG IT. AND THERE IS THERE IS NOT AN AMOUNT. YEAH I LOST YOU THERE AT THE END THE AMOUNT WAS ONE POINT NINE. BUT DOES THAT NOT MEAN YOU CAN SPEND THREE BILLION DOLLARS IF IT'S AVAILABLE AND WE DON'T GET ME WRONG- COMPENSATED BACKED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT OUR GENERAL FUND. WOULD BE- HAVE TO APPROPRIATE THOSE LOANS. BACK TO THE COUNTIES THAT- OPERATE THESE RENT RELIEF PROGRAMS. SO I'LL JUST I WON I WON AND I'M TRYING TO ASK WHAT'S THE RISK WHAT'S THE TOTAL RISK THERE IS NO NUMBER. THE NUMBER IS OPEN ENDED. A MINUTE MISLI ARE YOU. APOLOGY CENTER BY I CAN'T HEAR I CAN'T HEAR YOU HERZL UNLIMITED IF CAN YOU HEAR ME MISLI CAN YOU HEAR ME. NO SHE STILL CAN'T OKAY THERE IS. CAN YOU HEAR ME- CENTER GOALIE WHILE THEY'RE TWELVE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT. I CAN HEAR YOU OKAY GREAT SO SENATOR LEAHY'S QUESTION IS. IT IS THIS IS THE CASH FLOW IS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THE CASH FLOW THE RISK THAT'S BEING ASSUME TO NOW OR IS IT HIGHER. YES THE ONE POINT NINE BILLION WAS- THE STATE ESTIMATE OF THE QUEUE OF APPLICATIONS THAT. ARE GOING TO BE COMING IN THROUGH THE END OF MARCH. AND MARCH ISN'T AN IMPORTANT DATE BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN THE RENTER PROTECTIONS. THAT ARE INSTRUCTED NOT WOULD END AND SO THE PROGRAM IS ATTEMPTING TO. FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT COME IN. TO THAT POINT THAT IS THE ONE POINT NINE BILLION THAT WOULD THAT IS UNDER DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT. I UNDERSTAND THAT MY QUESTION WAS IS IT. THREE BILLION DOLLARS CAME IN IN. WHAT DO YOU DOES THIS AGAIN DOES THIS ALLOW TO SPEND MORE THAN ONE POINT NINE MILLION WHAT IS THE CAST WHEN I'M ASKING. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN. UNDER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN THAT THIS LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY INPUT IN IT MAINLY AT LEAST ON. OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH INPUT IN SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RISK IS. LONG TERM IS- CAPPERS ARE NO CAP. THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU. THERE IS NO CAP IN THE STATUTE WE DON'T ANTICIPATED REACHING THREE BILLION AGAIN WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF ONE POINT NINE BILLION. AND WE CONTINUED TO REQUEST FEDERAL FUNDING. OF BACK OUT. SO YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION THERE IS NO CAP THAT MEANS THAT OUR GENERAL FUND IS GOING TO BE. AT RISK OF WHATEVER AMOUNT THAT COMES IN AND GETS PAID THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER I HAVE. SOME COMMENTS NOW THAT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH THE- LEGISLATURE. AYE- LET ME IN I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT- MISLI SAID. IT IS A I THINK SHE AND SHE AND I CAN LETTER CORRECT BUT- I THINK SHE INTERPRETED WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT IF THREE BILLION CAME IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHEN I ASKED IF WE- THREE BILLION OKAY. IT WOULD HAVE I TRIED TO GET SHE ANSWERED THERE IS NO CAP SO THAT MEANS IF WE SPEND. THREE BILLION OR WE LOAN LET'S PUT IT IN A BETTER TERM WE LOAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT MEANS THAT THE GENERAL FOR IF WE DID NOT RECEIVE IT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE ON OUR GENERAL FUND IS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THAT AMOUNT WHATEVER THAT AMOUNT IS A CASH FLOW. LOAN WE ARE PROVING NOW IS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT IS BEFORE US. YEAH THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID. WELL I HAS OUT THERE IS THERE IS THE ONE POINT NINE A CAP ON RATE RELIEF. THERE'S A YES OR NO EITHER IT IS OR IT ISN'T. WELL THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT INCLUDE A CAP THE CAP IS THE ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE- PROVIDED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN REGARDS TO THE STATE MEET. THERE'S NO LANGUAGE IN THE LANGUAGE IS ONLY FOR A CASH FLOW LOAN SO IT IS NOT AN ALLOCATION IT IS ONLY ON A LOAN IT DOES NOT HAVE AN UP TO NUMBER BUT IT IS ONLY A CASH FLOW LOAN SO THERE IS NO ALLOCATION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. DAN BUT THERE IS A LIABILITY AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS A LIABILITY IN WHATEVER THAT. WHATEVER THE AMOUNT IS THAT GETS LOAN. IS LIFE IS THE LIABILITY IF THEY GIVE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT THAT YOU'VE ANSWERED MY QUESTION I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THERE IS NO CAP. AND WE ARE RISKING WHATEVER THE AMOUNT IS IT COULD BE ONE POINT NINE OR IT COULD BE. THREE BILLION WE DON'T KNOW. BUT I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THANK YOU. I'M WE I BEFORE I GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT I WOULD HATE I DON'T KNOW IT SORRY SENATOR DOLE IF YOU HAD MORE DO YOU HAVE YES I DID I WANTED. I WANTED TO SAY. GUARDS TWO. NO BID CONTRACTS I THINK THAT'S WHAT. WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH OUR SIDE ALVIN THOMAS ONE SENATOR MELENDEZ IS BRINGING FORTH. THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND WE SEE NO BID CONTRACTS WE'VE SEEN MANY OF THEM AND THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING SCRUTINIZED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. THEIR LEAD OUT WITH NO. THERE'S NO R. P. THERE'S NO REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL THESE ARE JUST CONTRACTS MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATION. LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE. THERE IS A CONTRACT LET FOR THE SLEEP TRAIN ARENA TO HAVE COPD PATIENTS GO OUT THERE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. NO BID CONTRACT. THEY SAW NINE PATIENTS IT'S NOT PERFORMING AT THE LEVELS WE WANT WE'VE BEEN INTO THIS CAN'T PANDEMIC NOW FOR HOW LONG A LONG TIME. AND IF WE STAND IN THE STATE EMERGING DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF IT ANYTIME SOON I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP IN AND SAY NO TO THE GOVERNOR. AND NOTED THAT MINISTRATION THAT WE WANT TO SEE THESE CONTRACTS WE WANT TO SEE PERFORMANCES ON THOSE CONTRACTS. IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT WE NEED TO DO OUR JOB BUT WE'VE IS HE SERVED ALL OF OUR POWER. TO THE GOVERNOR. TO A GUY WHO CAN YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. TWO GUYS WHO CAN SIT IN A BASEBALL OR A FOOTBALL STADIUM WITH NO MASK ON UNTIL MY CHILD SHE HAS TO WEAR A MASK AT SCHOOL. THAT'S THE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM HERE THEY ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING IS NOT RELATING BACK AND FORTH. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MONEY LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GETTING THESE CONTRACTS WE DON'T DO THAT HERE. WE JUST OPEN ENDED A CAR. THE BUDGET. TO ALLOW TO SPEND MONEY THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY BACK IF IT DOESN'T GET COMMITTEE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO I THINK THIS IS THE PLACE WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT WE DON'T. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM. BECAUSE WE'RE UNDER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND WE'VE GIVEN ALL THE POWER OF THIS LEGISLATURE. AND THIS PARTY. TODAY MINISTRATION AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN IN THIS A LONG TIME NOW. WE DO A LOT MORE THAN WE KNEW WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OUT AND IT'S TIME THAT WE ACTUALLY DO OUR JOB. AND TAKE BACK THE POWER. I'M SORRY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU'RE WELCOME. LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER MIKES UP BEFORE. RIGHT OKAY- MODERATOR YOU CAN GET READY TO KEEP FOLKS UP WE'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE IN THE ROOM BUT BEFORE THAT I WANT TO SAY. THAT IN MY HI READ OUR MATERIALS CAREFULLY I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE AUTHORIZATION OF A CASH FLOW LOAN IS PUT IS THAT IS APPROVING A RISK AND ET AT LEAST ALL HIGH AND WE AND I- WE WILL SEE BUT I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUES TO AGREE. THAT THE RISK. OF HAVING. PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW HOUSE ON THE STREET FOR HAVING SMALL LANDLORDS NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE TENANTS CANNOT PAY THEM IS A HIGHER RISK IN MY OPINION THEN THE RISK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVEN THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE REDISTRIBUTING FUNDS NOW I AM LESS CONCERNED ABOUT ARE. HIGHLY EXCEEDING THE ESTIMATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS GIVEN BECAUSE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR IT TO PROCESS A FIGURE SUCH AS THREE BILLION IN THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH AND THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE PENDING AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT IT IT'S BASED ON SOME REAL DATA BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THE PROGRAM OPEN FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. ON SO WHILE WE CERTAINLY HAVE DIFFERING OPINIONS AS TO WHICH OF THESE ACTIONS ARE GIVING THE ADMINISTRATION PERHAPS MORE THROUGH ALREADY THEN WE SHOULD I AM VERY CLEAR THAT THE ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING TODAY ARE BOTH. TO MY TASTE OR NOT THE CARD US ACTING TO GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION THE AUTHORITY. AND THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN ACTIONS IN HERE LIKE THE COVERED RELIEF ONES WHERE THEY COULD HAVE OTHERWISE GONE THROUGH JAIL BC BUT WE AS THE LEGISLATURE SAID NO WE WILL. WE ARE NOT GOING TO ACT ON THEM AND THAT WAY WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS THESE HEARINGS AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING THEM BEFORE US AND WE ARE GOING TO ACT ON THE FLOOR. SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT ON THE RECORD AND- WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO PUBLIC HEARING AND LET ME HAVE THE FOLKS IN WHO ARE PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THE HEARING ROOM. THEY CAN BEGIN AND THEN MODERATOR YOU CAN START KILLING PEOPLE UP RIGHT. PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR I ASSUME ONE MINUTE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
