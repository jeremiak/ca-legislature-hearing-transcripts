THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS OR REFER YOU TO SOMEONE WHO CAN. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES TO THEM. I HAVE BEEN SERVING IN THE REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. I STARTED A SERVICE COORDINATOR IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND EVENTUALLY ROSE TO MY CURRENT POSITION IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN I AM ALSO THE GRANDMOTHER OF A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD YOUNG MAN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY. LIKE SOME FAMILIES HERE THIS EVENING I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE STRUGGLES AND THE JOYS OF HAVING A FAMILY MEMBER WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. WITH MY DAUGHTER AT THE HELM WE HAVE BEEN STRONG ADVOCATES FOR HIS MEDICAL AND EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. IT HAD BEEN DIFFICULT AT TIMES YET WE REMAIN STRONG AS A TEAM IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT HE RECEIVED THE SERVICES HE NEEDS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER OF HIS COMMUNITY. I AM VERY WHERE I AM VERY AWARE OF THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE AGENCY AND MY PURPOSE THIS EVENING. IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION TO CLARIFY WHY SOME OF THE CURRENT ISSUES REMAIN A CHALLENGE. IN THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS GAPS IN ITS SERVICE PROVISIONS PARTICULARLY IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY AND WE ARE DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN ACCOMPLISHING THAT GOAL AND WELCOME THE FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY AND HELPING US IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS OUR PRIORITIES. IN THE REGIONAL CENTER CURRENTLY EMPLOYS SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE STAFF OF HIM FIVE COORDINATORS. WE ARE A LARGE AGENCY COVERING TO COUNTIES AND OUR STRUCTURE REFLECTS THIS. WE HAVE A LARGE SPECIALIZED UNITS WHICH CONSIST OF THE FEDERAL MEDICAID WAIVER PROGRAM. LEGAL INTAKE AND CLINICS. ON A MONTHLY BASIS OUR INTAKE UNIT PROCESSES AN AVERAGE OF THREE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE FOUND ELIGIBLE OR TRANSFER IN FROM OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS. THIS DATA REFLECTS THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF HOMES AND BUSINESSES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. ARE GROWING POPULATION IS CURRENTLY AT THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN CONSUMERS. WE HAVE MANY NEW EMPLOYEES BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT TAKES TIME FOR THESE EMPLOYEES TO LEARN WHO THEIR CONSUMERS ARE WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AND WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE REALIZE THAT REASSIGNING CONSUMERS TO NEW AND DIFFERENT CASE MANAGER THIS FRUSTRATING FOR FAMILIES AND THAT GETTING TO KNOW THEM CAN'T TAKE TIME. BUT IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ADDRESS SUCH GROWTH. I RC IS THE LARGEST OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS BOTH IN GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND NUMBER OF CONSUMERS SERVED. I RC SERVER SAMBAR MEDINA AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES WHICH HAVE A COMBINED AREA OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE MILES AND A COMBINED POPULATION OF OVER FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE. SERVING OUR POPULATION GEOGRAPHIC AREA IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE OR PERHAPS AN EVEN GREATER CHALLENGE IS ADDRESSING THE REGION'S GROWTH. IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND THEN REGIONAL CENTER HAD APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED CONSUMERS. WHICH MEANS WE ARE GROWING BY MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND CONSUMERS PER YEAR. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR GROWTH HAS OUTPACED OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP THE RESOURCES TO MEET THAT GROWTH. HOWEVER WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO DO JUST THAT. I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS OUR SERVICE GAPS. TO DO THIS I RC NEEDS TO BETTER FUND OUR CURRENT PROVIDERS AND PROBABLY EVEN BRING MORE SERVICE PROVIDERS INTO OUR AREA. HOWEVER THIS IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT MAY SOUND. MANY SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE UNWILLING TO GO OUT INTO OUR MORE DISTANT OR ISOLATED AREAS SUCH AS THE COACHELLA VALLEY WHERE THEY ARE MOST NEEDED. ESPECIALLY FOR THE RATES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR SERVICE. IN THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE NUMBER ONE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER YOU EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT PUTTING ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD ON ALREADY OVERTAXED REGIONAL CENTERS. PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING EXISTING CASELOADS CASELOAD RATIOS AND NON COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. ASSEMBLY FRAZIER YOU REPEATEDLY NOTED CHALLENGES IN SERVING INDIVIDUALS IN A SYSTEM THAT IS UNDERFUNDED. AND LACKING ENOUGH PROVIDERS TO MEET EXISTING EXISTING NEEDS. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ONGOING EFFORT TO EDUCATE YOURSELF AND THE ASSEMBLY ABOUT THE NEEDS OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITY. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR FAMILIES TO UNDERSTAND HOW INLAND REGIONAL CENTERS ELIGIBILITY PROCESS WORKS. REQUESTING AN INTAKE APPLICATION IS THE FIRST STEP IN APPLYING FOR SERVICES. AN APPLICANT CAN DO SO BY EITHER COMPLETING AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE OR BY CALLING OUR INTAKE DEPARTMENT. IF APPROPRIATE THE APPLICANT WILL RECEIVE AN INTAKE PACKET CONTAINING AN APPLICATION. CONSENT FORMS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ELIGIBILITY AND REGIONAL CENTER PROCESSES. REFERRALS ARE MADE BY PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS OF APPLICANTS UNDER AGE. EIGHTEEN AN APPLICANT AGE EIGHTEEN AND OLDER SHOULD REFER THEMSELVES. IF THE APPLICANT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER OR FRIEND ASSIST THEM DURING THE PROCESS THEY MUST FIRST GIVE CONSENT. ONCE ELIGIBLE. THE CONSUMER IS A FIND A SERVICE COORDINATOR WHO WILL COME TO THE CONSUMERS HOME AND DEVELOP THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLAN ALSO CALLED THE I. P. P.. THE I. P. P. IS THE PROCESS WHERE THE FAMILY CONSUMER AND SERVICE COORDINATOR EXPLORE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. SOME OF THE SERVICES MAY BE REGIONAL CENTER FUNDED AND SOME MAY BE GENERIC. REGIONAL CENTERS ARE NOT DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS WE CONTRACT WITH VENDORS WHO PROVIDE THE SERVICES SUCH AS RESPITE IN BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT. THE SERVICE COORDINATOR ASSIST THE CONSUMER TO OBTAIN SERVICES AND TO HELP THE PERSON HELP THEMSELVES. AT THE I. P. P. THE CONSUMER AND FAMILY DECIDE HOW OFTEN THEY WANT TO HAVE ROUTINE CONTACT. GENERALLY ANNUALLY SEMI ANNUALLY AND QUARTERLY. THE SERVICE COORDINATOR CAN CONTACT YOU OR YOU MAY CONTACT THEM AT ANY TIME TO DISCUSS ANY QUESTIONS OR NEEDS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THIS IS JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHO WE ARE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR INPUT AND SUGGESTIONS. KEVIN IS UP NEXT AND WE'LL DISCUSS THE VARIOUS WE PET PLACE THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS KEVIN ARTS ON THE ASSOCIATE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN ONE REGIONAL CENTER. AND I'VE BEEN AT THE CENTER FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AND I TO STARTED HIS CASE MANAGER. I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN THE MINION THANKING YOU FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT TO LISTEN TO THE INPUT FROM FROM THE COMMUNITY. WE ARE AWARE THAT WE HAVE GAPS IN OUR SERVICE PROVISION AND ARE DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS IN THE FUTURE. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN ACCOMPLISHING THAT GOAL. THIS IS THE SECOND SUCH HEARING HELD IN HIGHER SEIZE AREA AND WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT THE ASSEMBLY RECOGNIZES THAT AN AREA AS LARGE AS OURS. HAS VERY DIVERSE NEEDS AND ISSUES. THE VINEYARD MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS OUR SERVICE GAPS. TO DO THAT. HIGHER SEED NEEDS TO BETTER FIND OUR CURRENT PROVIDERS IN PROBABLY BRING MORE SERVICE PRIOR PROVIDERS INTO THE AREA. LAVIGNE ALSO MENTION THAT MANY SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE UNWILLING TO GO OUT TO THE MORE DISTANT ARE ISOLATED AREAS WHERE THEY ARE MOST NEEDED. BECAUSE OF THE INADEQUATE RATES THAT WE'RE ALLOWED TO OFFER FOR THEIR SERVICES. I WOULD LIKE TO READ AN EXCERPT FROM AN EMAIL FROM SEAT EDUCATION INCORPORATED A COMMUNITY INTEGRATION BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT AND STARK SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SERVICE PROVIDER. THAT WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO BRING INTO THIS AREA. DEAR I RC AT ITS MEETING ON JANUARY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF SEEK EDUCATION INCORPORATED. CAREFULLY CONSIDERED I ARE SEIZE PROPOSED FUNDING OF SEEKS PROGRAMS. HOWEVER THE PROPOSED REGIONAL CENTER RATES FOR THE SERVICES WERE FOUND TO BE INSUFFICIENT AND UNSUSTAINABLE TO ENSURE THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR THE CONSUMERS. THIS DECISION IS NOT OF COURSE A REFLECTION OF VIRUSES VALUES AND DEDICATION TO THE COMMUNITY. IT ONLY INDICATES THE SCOPE OF THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO MEET. THE CHALLENGING NEEDS OF THE CONSUMERS. SEEK EDUCATION RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS TO DELIVER EFFECTIVE AND HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS. THE PROPOSED REDUCED RATE HAS LED TO A DIFFICULT DECISION OF COMPROMISING THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM. A POSITION THAT WOULD BE AN APPLICABLE AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO ADDRESS THE VERY CHALLENGE THAT INITIALLY BROUGHT US TOGETHER. AND THE END OF THIS. TOGETHER ON THIS ENDEAVOR AND QUOTE. WE REALIZE I RC WE REALIZE WE HAD I RC REALIZE THAT WE HAVE DIVERSE POPULATION OF CONSUMERS OR UNDERSERVED OR UNSERVED. AGAIN WE ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO CHANGE THIS. HOWEVER REACHING OUT TO UNDERSERVED CONSUMERS AND RETHINKING OUR SERVICE DESIGNS WILL COME AT A COST. HIGHER SEAT IS NOT COMPLETE ITS FISCAL YEAR WITH THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE SURPLUS WE SPEND ALL THE MONEY THAT WE ARE ALLOCATED. ACCORDING TO THE DDS DASHBOARD FOUND ON THEIR WEBSITE THE AVERAGE EXPENDITURE FOR CONSUMERS OF ALL AGES STATEWIDE. IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER CONSUMER PER YEAR. HOWEVER AND HIGHER SEIZE CATCHMENT AREA THAT AMOUNT IS ONLY TEN THOUSAND EIGHTY PER CONSUMER PER YEAR. WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THAT THE OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS ARE OVER FUNDED WE REALIZE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. HOWEVER WE DO HOPE THAT HIGHER SEE MY SEE MORE COMPARABLE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT ALSO THAT IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY WHERE WE HAVE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE CONSUMERS. WE SPENT TWO MILLION. SIX HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TEN THOUSAND SEVENTY SEVEN PER CONSUMER PER YEAR. THIS IS JUST THREE DOLLARS PER YEAR LESS THAN WE SPEND PER CONSUMER THROUGHOUT THE REST OF OUR CATCHMENT AREA. ANOTHER ISSUES THAT ARE EXISTING SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY HIRING STAFF BECAUSE THE RATES HIGHER SEE IS ALLOWED TO OFFER ARE SO LOW. THEY SIMPLY CAN'T COMPETE WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES. IF WE DEVELOP MORE PROGRAMS ONE MORE REASONABLE RATES AND WE PROVIDE MORE SERVICES TO UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED DIVERSE POPULATIONS ARE PER CAPITA EXPENDITURES ARE SURE TO INCREASE. WITH THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND CONSUMERS AND GROWING IF WE JUST WOULD NEED TO PURCHASE A SERVICE. AUGMENTATION OF A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION. HOWEVER EVEN RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IMPLEMENTED AND VERY LARGE REGIONAL CENTERS CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT. FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THE THIRTY HOUR MONTH CAP ON RESPITE WAS REMOVED. WE WERE WE VERY MUCH A PLOT THAT DECISION BUT AS A RESULT HIGHER SEES ANYONE RESPITE EXPENDITURE. FOR JUMPED FROM APPROXIMATELY FIFTY TWO MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THREE MILLION AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND IS NOW UP OVER EIGHTY FOUR MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS IS AN INCREASE OF OVER THIRTY TWO MILLION IN THE PAST TWO YEARS AND RESPITE ALONE. OUR SEIZE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS P. O. S. DISPARITY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN IN THIS RESULT SINCE JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE NUMBER OF NEW AUTHORS RESPITE AUTHORIZATIONS. ERROR SEE IS. FOUR THOUSAND NINETY EIGHT OF THESE NEW REQUEST THREE THOUSAND EIGHT ARE APPROXIMATELY 75% OR FOR CONSUMERS WHO PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED NO POS. WE REALIZE WE HAVE GAS AND DEFICIT CENTER SERVICE PROJECT PROVISION AND ARE WELL AND WELCOME THE FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY. AND HELPING US IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE PRIORITIES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN MORE RURAL AREAS WHERE IT IS DIFFICULT TO TRACK SERVICE SERVICE PROVIDERS. I SHOULD NOTE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS OUR RATES ARE SO LOW AS THE TRADITIONALLY HIGHER SEE WAS A VERY CONSERVATIVE EVEN CHEAP REGIONAL CENTER. THE RESULT IS THAT RATES NEGOTIATED A DECADE OR TWO A OR TWO AGO RELATIVELY LOW. WHILE THIS MAY BE ADMIRABLE FROM THE TAXPAYER PERSPECTIVE IT IS HAD SERIOUS LONG TERM NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR HIGHER C.. DESPITE OUR AIR SEIZE CURRENT EFFORTS TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY. ELEVEN YEARS AGO WELL FOR INSTITUTIONS COAT FORTY SIX NINETY ONE WAS INSTITUTED AND LIMITED HIGHER SEIZE ABILITY TO OFFER RATES THAT EXCEEDED EXISTENT EXISTING MEDIAN RATES. THIS IS COUNTRY SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE STAGNATION AND RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT IN OUR AREA. I'M SURE THAT YOU ARE AWARE THAT THERE WAS A RECENT ATTEMPT BY DDS AND A CONTRACTOR BURNS AND ASSOCIATES TO LOOK AT RATE. ADJUSTMENTS. WE HAVE SUMMARISED OUR OPPOSITION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS IN A LETTER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS AND MARCH NINETEENTH. AND IN A MEETING WITH HER ON APRIL FIFTEENTH. THERE ARE COPIES AVAILABLE FOR IF YOU WISH TO REVIEW THEM. WE DO SUPPORT THE 8% SHORT TERM ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE PROPOSED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER AND HOLDEN. AND WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO PROPOSE THIS. ALTHOUGH THE FOCUS OF THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN THE NEED TO AUGMENT SERVICE PROVIDER RATES AND INCREASE OUR PURCHASES SERVICE BUDGET. WE WOULD ALSO ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT AND CONSIDER THE METS METHODOLOGY FOR FUNDING IRIS. REGIONAL CENTER [INAUDIBLE] OPERATIONS COST. AS YOU KNOW HIGH STAFFING RATIOS ARE PROBLEM PRETTY MUCH THROUGHOUT THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. IN SOME REGIONAL CENTERS. IN SOME REGIONAL CENTERS HAVING ADEQUATE STAFFING MAY AMOUNT TO REPLACING PEOPLE WHO LEAVE OR HIRING OCCASIONAL GROWTH POSITIONS. HOWEVER AND I RC WERE GROWTH IS TREMENDOUS WE NEED TO HIRE NOT JUST FOR VACANCIES BUT ALSO TO MEET THAT TREMENDOUS GROWTH. THAT MEANS ADDITIONAL FURNITURE EQUIPMENT TRAVEL AND MILEAGE COSTS WHICH CURRENTLY EXCEED A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND EVENTUALLY MORE OFFICE SPACE WE NEED GOOD KIND OF A COP. IT HAPPENS ASIAN PACKAGE TO ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN TRADITIONAL FUNDING STRATEGIES. THAT THE STATE USES ARE BOTH ANTIQUATED AND INSUFFICIENT. THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN RESULT AN ATTORNEY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR SECURITY COST YET NONE OF THIS WAS CONSIDERED AN ART BUDGET ALLOCATION. IN FACT WE ACTUALLY RETURN ONE POINT ABOUT. ONE POINT FOUR MILLION IN RENTS. AFTER WE HAVE LOST THE USE OF OUR GOD RESOURCE CENTER -- CONFERENCE CENTER. LIVING YOU MENTION THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE EMPLOYEES. TWO YEARS AGO THIS TIME WE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY IN OUR CASE LAWS ARE EVEN HIGHER NOW THAN THEY WERE THEN. WE CURRENTLY NEED FIFTY THREE MORE CSC'S PLUS SUPPORT STAFF AND EQUIPMENT TO GET. TO SEVENTY TO ONE I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT MANY IN MANY INSTANCES WHERE FUNDING FOR ONE POSITION WHEN AN AGENCY OR SCIENCE HAS SEVERAL. IT IS A VERY INEQUITABLE APPROACH. FINALLY WE SOMETIMES RECEIVE FAB FEEDBACK OF OUR LACK OF PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR INFORMATION WE PUT TOGETHER A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE CONTACTS AND OUTREACH EFFORTS WE HAVE MADE IN THE COACHELLA. VALLEY COMMUNITY IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND IT DOES LIST THE STAFF PEOPLE OF AFFILIATED WITH THOSE ARE REACH COPIES. FINALLY BEFORE CONCLUDING I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY MENTION A PROGRAM AFFILIATED WITH I RC THAT HELPS CONSUMERS IN WAYS THAT THE WOMEN ACT CANNOT ACCOMMODATE. ANOTHER WAY WAS STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BY A HANDFUL OF I RC STAFF WITH THE GOAL OF BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN HIGHER SEE ALLOWED SERVICES. AND OTHER A MEDIA TEMPORARY SERVICES THE IRC COULD NOT FIND. ANOTHER WAY WAS AND IS FUNDED BY HIGHER SEE DON'T HIGHER SEE STAFF DONATIONS FUNDRAISERS AN INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY DONATIONS. IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX CONSUMERS WERE SERVICE A HUNDRED AND SEVEN OF THOSE LIVING IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. THIS INCLUDES ONE TIME PAYMENTS FOR RENT UTILITIES CLOTHING BURIAL SPEND DENTAL WORK. THE AVERAGE GRANT AMOUNT IS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AND AGAIN NONE OF THIS FUNDING COMES THROUGH THE STATE. TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN HIGHER SEE STAFF AND BOARD MEMBERS DONATE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR TO THIS BECAUSE THAT'S AND 7% INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR. ALSO ALTHOUGH THIS YEAR'S ANOTHER WAY GOLF TOURNAMENT WAS HELD INTO MACULA. LAST YEAR'S TOURNAMENT AND NEXT YEAR'S TOURNAMENT WILL BOTH BE HELD IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY COMMUNITY JEANERETTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR GARCIA YOU HAD SOME QUESTIONS OF THE UP PANEL YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND I HE WAS THE SOLE. WANTING TO GET THIS STARTED THAT I DIDN'T GIVE MISTER FRAZIER THE APPROPRIATE WARM WELCOMING. TO THE COACHELLA VALLEY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND COMING OUT HERE I WANT -- TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK ANY TIME -- YOU HAVE AN ORGANIZATION COME BEFORE YOU AND BEGINS TO CONVERSATION WITH AN INTROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF WHERE THEY'RE AT I I THINK IT'S COMMENDABLE TO SAY THE LEAST -- YOU'VE BASICALLY OUTLINED A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT I ARTS HE SEES. HERE IN THE COACHELLA AND BLIGHTED AREA. WHAT ARE THE PERCENTAGES OF -- CONSUMERS RIGHT THAT THAT COME FROM THIS AREA IN COMPARISON -- TO THE OVERALL -- CONSUMERS THAT YOU HAVE OUR CLIENTS -- AND I OR SEEN SO YOU YOU WHO ACTUALLY OUTLINED A NUMBER OF ANSWERS. TO MY QUESTIONS KIND OF PREEMPTIVE AND I APPRECIATE THAT I DO WANT TO GET INTO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. KIND OF YOUR STRATEGY MOVING FORWARD YOU MENTION ABOUT SERVICE PROVIDERS WHAT IS THAT STRATEGY LOOK LIKE FOR I RC AS IT RELATES TO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. MORE PROVIDERS ON THE GROUND FOR OUR CLIENTS AND CONSUMERS HERE IN THE AREA AND MAYBE -- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR YOU MAY BE ABLE TO START THE CONVERSATION ON THAT. WELL UP ON ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- OUR AGENCY IS A RECRUITING -- HOME GROWN PROVIDERS AND A SOME OF THE AREA IF THEY WANT TO COME IN. AND IT'S A GETTING A PERSON ESTABLISHED IN THE AREA WITH AT LEAST A NUMBER OF CONSUMERS. TO BE ABLE TO STE SUSTAINED THAT COMPANY -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT COME INTO PLAY FOR THAT. BUT WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING IN THIS AREA AND WE ARE AT THIS TIME INVOLVED IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OUT HERE IN THIS AREA AS WELL -- AND WE'LL BE GLAD -- TO ME A PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO YOU AND I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE SOME LIST OF SOME PROVIDERS THANK YOU. AS IT RELATES TO THE RATES IN THE REIMBURSEMENT THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE THAT OUR OFFICES HAD A CONVERSATION WITH YOU BEFORE WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE MOVING FORWARD. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT A GREATER -- A PRESENCE OF A PROVIDERS IN THE AREA FOR THE CLASS. I MEAN WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE RATE STUDIES OR ANY THAT IS GOING TO MEAN -- BUT THE FOR INSTANCE THE MEDIAN RATE ISSUE IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR US BECAUSE AS I EXPLAINED EARLIER THAT. IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD VERY LOW RATES HERE. IN NEGOTIATED VERY LOW RATES AND THEN THEY ESSENTIALLY PUT A FREEZE BACK ELEVEN YEARS AGO THAT SAID THAT NO NEW RATES CAN EXCEED THE MEDIAN. SO UNTIL THAT IS IS CHANGING EVEN WE PROBABLY BE CONTENT IF THE IF WE WERE LIMITED TO THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN AS OPPOSED TO JUST OUR LOCAL MEDIA -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES WE ARE RATE IT DOESN'T ISN'T ENOUGH FOR ON PEOPLE TO HIRE PEOPLE AT MINIMUM WAGE MUCH LESS PAY BENEFITS -- OR HAVE THEIR OWN OVERHEAD COVERAGE SO -- LIKE WITH THE SEEK ISSUE YOU KNOW WE GET PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE COME HERE FROM ALL OVER WE HAVE PEOPLE COME FROM LEARNED SAN DIEGO -- LA COUNTY AND THEY HAVE POTENTIAL VENDORS THAT WILL COME WITH THEM BUT WHEN THEY HEAR THE RATE THAT WE CAN THAT WE'RE ALLOWED TO GIVE THEY SAID WE CAN'T DO IT. YOU'VE UNDOUBTEDLY HAD A A BIGGER PRESENCE -- IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND APPRECIATE. YOU BRING IN THE ENTIRE TEAM AND THEM BEING INTRODUCED TO THE COMMUNITY SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. WHAT THEIR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE -- WITH I RC AND THAT THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE ON A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL AS IT RELATES TO HAVING THEIR PRESENCE HERE AND I REPRESENT ALL THE WAY TO THE NORTH SHORE BOUNDARY WITH THE PEARL COUNTY. DOWN TO IT BLIGHTED AREA THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY -- BUT LONG -- IN TERMS OF THE DISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO COME TO COACHELLA FROM LIFE OR FOR THAT MATTER EVEN FROM THE NORTH SHORE AREA WHAT IS. AND OF THAT LOOK LIKE FOR YOU MOVING FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN A A PERMANENT PRESENCE -- HERE IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY TO HAVE PEOPLE A SEEK THE SERVICES THAT YOU PROVIDE. WELL -- IN A SEVERE THE LANHAM ACT YOU KNOW WE WE WORK WITH THE CONSUMERS IN THAN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY LIVE. SO OUR STAFF MAY LIVE ANYWHERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE -- AND WE HAVE TWO LOCATIONS ONE IN SAN BERNADINO AND ONE IN RIVERSIDE. SO WHEREVER THEIR OFFICES THEY WOULD BE TRAVELING FROM THAT LOCATION -- WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PRESENCE IN BLYTH AND OUT HERE IN THE LOWER DESERT AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE VISITING THEIR CONSUMERS AS NEEDED. AND WORKING WITH THE VENDORS ALSO WE ALSO HAVE SOME -- A LARGER -- VENDORS SUCH AS DESERT ARC WHERE A LOT OF MEETINGS CAN BE HELD SO WE MOVIE FORWARD -- WE HAVE TALKED WITH OUR INTAKE DEPARTMENT AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SET UP A CLINIC -- OUT IN THIS AREA AND ALSO IN THE PAST WE'VE ALSO HAD A SMALL SATELLITE OFFICE IN PALM DESERT. AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO -- TO MAKE IT. EASIER FOR FAMILIES -- TO JUST SIT DOWN AND CHAT WE ALSO HAVE DONE THIS IN THE PAST WITH A SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE DESERT SANDS IN PALM SPRINGS. WE WITH YOU KNOW JUST HAVE MEETINGS AND THEIR TO MAYBE PUBLIC HEARINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT FOR OUR FAMILIES BUT OUR OUR SERVICE COORDINATORS. NEED TO BE VISITING. THERE ARE CONSUMERS IN THEIR HOMES IN THEIR WORK IN THEIR SCHOOLS THANK YOU YOUR HONOR AND IF WE CAN ADD YOU KNOW -- WE APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME OUT HERE AND BUT I SUSPECT THAT. WE WOULD HAVE THAT SAME KIND OF QUESTION IN INTEREST IF WE HAD -- THESE MEETINGS THROUGHOUT OUR CATCHMENT AREA WE SERVE THE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES AND I'M SURE THE PEOPLE UP IN. YOU KNOW HYSTERIA IN VICTORVILLE WOULD FEEL THAT SAME WAY AND DOWN INTO MACULA AND THE I GUESS THE THE POINT ONE OF THE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS THAT NO MATTER WHERE WE ARE UNLESS WE HAVE TONS OF DIFFERENT OFFICES -- WE HAVE A LOT OF TRAVELING TO DO FROM FROM THE BASE WERE GROWING AT A TREMENDOUS RATE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE FOR THE FUTURE -- YOU KNOW LEGISLATIVELY WHAT WE'RE FOR MORE THAN ONE REGIONAL CENTER I DON'T VOTE WILL BE AT FORTY THOUSAND BEFORE LONG -- THE THE GROWTH IS A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR US NOT JUST OUR SIZE BUT THE GROWTH. I WANT TO SAY -- I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT. AT THAT YOU ARE ARE COVERING A LOT OF AREA AND THE THE QUESTION HERE IS ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT -- AND THIS MAY BE A A RADICAL YOU KNOW THINKING. TO MAKE SENSE OF THE CATCHMENT AREA BE. TURNED INTO TWO AREAS A GIVEN THE LARGE TERRITORY THAT YOU'RE COVERING -- IN DECEMBER -- DINO AND RIVERSIDE AREA. COUNTY AREA. M. M. YEAH I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR YOUR TAKE ON THAT -- CERTAINLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE THINK ABOUT WE HAVE -- CONSIDERED AND AND HAVE A LOOK AT PROPERTIES AT RIVERSIDE COUNTY FOR A LARGER PRESENCE -- WE HAVE A HUNDRED STAFF IN THE RIVERSIDE OFFICE AND WE COULD MOVE OUT OVER A HUNDRED MORE IF WE COULD -- ABLE TO TO DO THAT UNFORTUNATELY IT JUST HASN'T BEEN -- SOMETHING THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR US OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN -- FINANCIALLY MANAGE AT THIS TIME BUT IT IT IS ON OUR WOULD WOULD -- THIS CATCHMENT AREA BE THE LARGEST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT AND WHO WOULD BE THE SECOND AND WHAT'S THE KIND OF? DIFFERENCE THAN AND MAYBE GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORY AND AND PERHAPS EVEN IN POPULATION THAT'S BEEN SIR. WOULD YOU WOULD YOU KNOW I WOULD MÙT RIGHT NOW AND WE TALK ABOUT WE'RE ALMOST A FORTY THOUSAND IS PRETTY EVENLY SPLIT BERNADINE NOW. BECAUSE IT'S CATCHING UP -- MORE HOMES ARE BEING BUILT IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE SEEING THIS. THIS DOES PRETTY MUCH EQUALITY WITH THE WITH THE DIVISION SO I WILL SHARE WITH YOU YOU ARE LISTENING THROUGH THE HEARINGS THAT WE HAD TO DEATH WITHIN -- SIX THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE INTRODUCED AB SIX TWENTY SEVEN SO REGIONAL CENTERS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SATELLITE FACILITIES. IN LARGE RURAL AREAS SO THIS IS ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES. FOR GOOD YOUR IDEAS AND IN FACT I UP. I'M I'M WONDERING YOU KNOW OF A A LARGER PRESENCE OUT HERE IN MY OPINION ONE ACTUALLY LEAD TO MORE -- CONSUMERS. ARE. CURRENTLY IT'S MENTIONED -- BY YOUR COMMENTS AT TWO THOUSAND OF THE CLOSE TO FORTY THOUSAND ARE FROM THIS AREA I I I I IT'S HARD FOR ME TO THINK THAT THAT'S THE POPULATION AND ONLY POPULATION THAT'S OUT HERE AND SO -- HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE YOU KNOW -- BEING ABLE TO WITHIN THE MEMBERS OF YOUR BUDGETS AND PERSONNEL AND THAT AS PEOPLE'S HEARING SEE YOU HERE IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICT BEGINS TO SEND PEOPLE THERE ARE OFFICE SINCE PEOPLE THERE. WHAT WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE FOR YOU IN THE INSTANCE AT A IN ONE YEAR YOU GET? FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN ARE. NEW TO I RC SERVICES. WE ACTUALLY FACE THAT CHALLENGE NOW -- AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD IT IS NOT GOING TO BE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA BE SPENDING AN AVERAGE OF TEN THOUSAND PER CLIENT PER YEAR -- WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE BY DEFINITION OF FOR GOING TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT RECEIVING SERVICES IT'S GOING TO COST MORE -- AND IT'S GONNA INVOLVE MORE PEOPLE -- EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE A LOT MORE PEOPLE HERE THAT MAY BE ELIGIBLE I SUSPECT THAT'S THE CASE THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- YOU KNOW WHILE WE'RE CERTAINLY AT WITH THREE HUNDRED AND TAKES A MONTH -- WHAT WERE THE WORD IS OUT BUT -- YOU KNOW IT IS OUR GROWTH IS IS CERTAINLY -- EVIDENCE OF THAT THAT -- BUT YEAH THE GROWTH IS A PROBLEM. MY MY MAYBE WE GET CLOSE TO MY FINAL QUESTION RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THE REFERENCES. TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. ARE PARTICULARLY OTHER PARTS OF THE I. R. C. TERRITORY -- I CERTAINLY WILL LET MY COLLEAGUES THAT REPRESENT THOUGH THERE IS NO THAT I OUR STATE IS THINKING ABOUT THEM AND THE NEEDS. IN THOSE REGIONS -- BUT FOR ME HERE IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY IN IN THE BLIGHTED AREA RIGHT I GET TO INTERFACE WITH PEOPLE WHY REPRESENT YEAR AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMES UP REGULARLY. IS WHAT IS THE JOB THAT PROCESS INTERNALLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE CASE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING -- OFTEN TIMES -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMES TO OUR ATTENTION IS BUT WE'RE NOT HEARING BACK FROM OUR REPRESENTATIVE WERE NOT -- GETTING CLEAR AND CONCISE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS WERE NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE APPEAL PROCESS IS IS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT UP WE WERE -- VETTED -- ENTIRELY AS IT RELATES TO THE SERVICES THAT WERE SEEKING OUT WOULD YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT THAT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE FOR THOSE THAT ARE HERE THE THOSE ARE WATCHING IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY LOOKS LIKE. THE ONE ON THE FOR YOU OUR INTERNAL STRUCTURE IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT THAT POINT WHEN SOMEBODY GOES THROUGH IN TANKER COMES YOU'RE FROM ANOTHER ARIAN IS ASSIGNED A CASE MANAGER. IN FACT IN THE PAST WE USED TO REQUIRE THAT EVERYBODY BE SEEN QUARTERLY -- AND BECAUSE OF THE GROWTH THE END INCREASES AND DEMANDS OF WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO AND BECAUSE OF OUR GROWTH HERE -- WE MADE. THEY REQUIREMENTS. IS ACTUALLY A ONE YEAR ONCE A YEAR AND THEN AS NEEDED WE WERE REQUIRING EVERY QUARTER. BUT WE WENT BACK TO THE FIFTH IF THE FAMILY FELT THAT ONE YEAR ONCE YOU'RE WAS OKAY THEN THAT'S THAT'S OKAY -- WE WOULD LIKE IN FACT I'VE BEEN GOING AROUND A MEETING WITH THE DIFFERENT UNITS AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO MAKE INFORMAL CONTACTS THEY LIKE AND EVERY FRIDAY OR WHATEVER. IN CALLING FAMILIES AND THAT THEY HAVEN'T TALKED TO IN SOMETIME JUST TO ESTABLISH CONTACT AND SAY HAND YOUR CASE WORKER AND THAT KIND OF THING JUST TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BUILD RELATIONSHIPS IN A YEAR. BUT THE CASE MANAGERS BECAUSE OF OUR GROWTH WE CHANGE CASE LAWS WE HAVE TO KEEP HIRING NEW PEOPLE. AND THEY NEED THEY DO TAKE SOME TIME TO TRAIN AND AND YEAH WE MAKE MISTAKES AND THEY DON'T RESPOND SOMETIMES AND THEY DON'T RETURN YOUR CALL WE GET THAT AND AND WE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AND AND ARE WORKING ON THAT BUT EACH UNIT HAS ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT FIFTEEN TO ADMIT EVEN TWENTY CASE MANAGERS EACH OF THOSE HAS A PROGRAM MANAGER. AND IN EACH OF THE PROGRAM MANAGERS HAS A THE DIRECTOR OVER THEM DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES. IN DIRECTOR OF ADULT SERVICES IN THOSE TWO AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT HERE TONIGHT BUT DOWN MESA AND FULLY BAKER SEE ARE THOSE TWO DIRECTORS. AND OUR OUR PROGRAM MANAGERS TO THE THE SCHOOL AGE IN TRANSITION ARE HERE TONIGHT -- AND THEN WE OVERSEE THE DIRECTORS. SO THAT'S KIND OF THE THE STRUCTURE IN IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY OR A CONSUMER. IS NOT GIVEN THE SERVICE THAT THEY WANT. THE WAY IT SHOULD WORK AS THEY SHOULD GET A NOTICE OF ACTION. THAT EXPLAINS TO THEM -- THAT THERE AREN'T THERE STILL. IS NOT BEING. GRANTED EVEN IF IT'S NOT PARTIALLY GRANTED. AND WE THE I NOTICE OF ACTUAL SITE. THE LAND REGULATION FOR THEIR REASON AND THAT AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THAT. AND AFTER THE APPEAL WHEN THAT APPEAL LETTER GOES OUT THEY CAN MEDIATE OR THEY CAN HAVE AN INFORMAL MEETING. AND THEN IT'S ULTIMATELY SEEN BY -- OVER HEARD BY AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE MAKES THAT DECISION. INDEPENDENT FROM US -- TWO MORE QUESTIONS ONE IS -- KIND OF A OVER VIEW OF HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SPANISH SPEAKING POPULATION -- THAT -- GUYS. CONFRONTED WITH JUST A BIT MORE CHALLENGES RIGHT -- THE YOU REPRESENTED ARE YOU INTRODUCED I'M SORRY -- REPRESENTATIVE THAT DEALS WITH THAT KIND OF CULTURAL ASPECTS OF THE OPERATION WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN IN ITS KIND OF BEEN TIRED -- WE HAVE BILINGUAL COUNSELORS AND WE HAVE -- ARE BOTH OF OUR DIRECTORS FOR THE BIG GARCIA AND ALL MESA -- SPEAKS SPANISH -- AND CENTER RUIZ WHO IS THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE ADULT SERVICES OUT HERE SHE IS ACTUALLY FROM THIS AREA SHE'S FROM COACHELLA. HER MOTHER LIVES IN COACHELLA AND SO -- AS SHE SPEAKS SPANISH AND SO A OUR SERVICE COORDINATORS ARE SIGNED A CASELOAD BASED ON THE THE END OF THE CULTURE AWARENESS THAT THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CULTURE -- AND THE ABILITY TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. OF SO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE SOME OF US CAME TO THE INLAND EMPIRE AND MANY OF US WERE HERE. SO WE'RE REALLY PART OF THIS CULTURE OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND I TURN THE LOWER DESERT. AND AS YOU GET TO KNOW THE SERVICE COORDINATORS YOU'LL FIND THAT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME OUT HERE THEY WANT TO BE HERE THEY'VE LIVED HERE. AND WHEN WE TRY TO MATCH THAT AS OFTEN AS WE CAN. AS FAR AS OUR OUTRAGE GOALS THAT WE ON A GOVERNOR CO WHO IS HERE THIS ACTUALLY OUR DIVERSITY SPECIALIST AT THE REGIONAL CENTER -- SO I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S WHEN HER FOCUS. HER THAT IS HER FOCUS HERE AND ONE OF OUR OTHER YOU KNOW THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE IS TO DO OUR REGION TO GET SERVICES TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVING SERVICES. IN ONE OF THOSE SERVICES THAT'S BENEFICIAL I WOULD SAY AN APPLICANT APPLICABLES PROBABLY OUT HERE IS RESPITE AND AND AS WE'VE INDICATED WE HAD FOR NEW FOUR THOUSAND NEW RESPITE AUTHORIZATIONS LAST YEAR. AND SO WE FEEL THAT THAT OUR REACH. IS BEING EFFECTIVE -- CURRENTLY HE IS MY LAST QUESTION NALA WELL AND THEN I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH THE STATEMENT -- MY QUESTION IS -- IT CURRENTLY WHAT IS THE MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS. FROM THE KEY TO TWELVE SYSTEM. ARE ARE BEING ENROLLED -- WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION TO ENSURE THAT -- ONCE THEY TURN EIGHTEEN ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM THEY'RE NOW INTEGRATED INTO THE REGIONAL CENTER -- SERVICE PROVIDING -- ACTIVITIES -- AND PROGRAMS. I'M I'M NOT SURE I'M CLEAR ON THE QUESTION. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR LOCAL CONSTITUENTS IS THAT -- THEY WERE UNAWARE -- ONCE THEY LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL THAT WERE UNDER WHERE THE THE OF THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. RECEIVING CERTAIN SERVICES AT THE STATE CALIFORNIA HAS GUARANTEED -- UP POPULATION THAT THE IN ROLE PRIOR TO LEAVING HIGH SCHOOL AND SO I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT IS THE PARTNERSHIP LOOK LIKE -- TO ENSURE THAT -- STUDENTS LEAVING THE K. TO TWELVE SYSTEM ARE SEAMLESSLY BEING TRANSITION INTO THE I. R. C. CATCHMENT AREA TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROMOTE ME QUITE A WHAT SERVICES. AS AS A PARTNERS WITH THE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE FAMILY WE ATTEND THE I. E. P. AS SOON AS A CHILD IS AGE. THREE AND WE WERE THERE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM -- WE ARE INVITED TO THOSE MEETINGS AND BY DEVELOPING A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FAMILY IN THE SCHOOLS THAT NORMALLY THE CASE. THE TRANSITION PLAN -- BEGINS AT AGE SIXTEEN AND WE ARE THERE TO DISCUSS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THAT PERSON ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF SCHOOL SOME OF OUR CONSUMER STAY IN SCHOOL UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO SOME DO EXIT AT AGE. EIGHTEEN BUT WE DO HAVE WE HAVE SERVICES FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO CONTINUE TO GO TO COLLEGE. THAT WANT A DIFF A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THAT WE DO HAVE OUT HERE. AND WE HAVE ANDREW AND BASS WHO ARE HERE THEY ARE THE THE EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST AND THEY WILL HELP -- TO BRIDGE THAT GAP -- NORMALLY AFTER SCHOOL THERE ARE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE -- AND IT'S JUST YOU KNOW DEPENDS ON WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL WANTS AND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. IN THE THE MORE RECENTLY OR THAT THE CMS YOU KNOW AND AND CMS RULE -- AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS IS REALLY EMPHASIZING. INDIVIDUATION AND YOU KNOW CAN UNITY INTEGRATION AND AS A RESULT OF THAT A LOT OF THE CENTER BASED TYPE WORK ACTIVITY WORKSHOP TYPE PROGRAMS APPEND LESS AND LESS FOCUSED ON IN MORE. INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY TRANSPORTATION IS SUCH A BIG CONCERN FOR US AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE THE RATE STUDY. WAS GOING TO DO A LOT OF DAMAGE TO OUR OUR TRANSPORTATION ISSUES AROUND HERE. AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE A CONCERN BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DON'T. TAKE WE DON'T GET CLIENTS IN OUR SYSTEM AT EIGHTEEN WE HAVEN'T THROUGHOUT THE AGE SPAN AND AND PART OF THE TRANSITION PLANET SCHOOL THEIR I. T. P. SHOULD INCLUDE US IN THERE -- BUT IT'S IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN US IN THE SCHOOL IT ISN'T IT ISN'T REALLY JUST A HAND OFF. ALLEN WITH THIS AND I THINK -- THE WORD PARTNERSHIP IS IS WHERE I WANT TO TAKE THIS I WANT. TO SAY THAT I WANT TO BE A PARTNER -- IN THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND I WANT YOU TO SEE US AS AN ADVOCATE -- IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AS IS -- CHAIRMAN FRAZIER TO THE WORK YOU DO -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE TELLING US WHAT IT IS THAT YOU NEED HERE I IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SERVICES -- TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THAT'S MY INTEREST -- FOR ME THIS IS BEEN A VERY EYE OPENING -- IN NEW ARENA OF PUBLIC POLICY -- TO UNDERSTAND AND CERTAINLY WE'RE STILL LEARNING AS WE GO AND AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE QUESTIONS -- AND THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE YOU KNOW YOU STARTED OFF WITH BEING -- SELF CRITICAL OF SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT YOU HAVE I THINK IT WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE THAT PERHAPS YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON AND I I RC AS WE WRAP UP THIS PANEL. AND WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. ONE WELL THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS GOING ON I THINK ESTABLISHING THE RELATIONSHIP. AND HAVING THE CONSUMERS ARE PRIORITY -- MOST OF US WHO YOU KNOW I WAS A SERVICE COORDINATOR SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE -- IT'S A BOND. AND IT'S A COMMITMENT AND NINE IN AND WORKING WITH THE FAMILY WORKING THAT WITH THE CONSUMER AND WATCHING THEM GROW AND ALL OF THEIR SUCCESSES. IS -- IT'S IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT REALLY IT JUST GETS TO YOU BECAUSE YOUR HEART IT'S A COMMITMENT -- AND IT'S JUST IT'S A VOCATION IS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOUR COMMITTED TO DOING IT. OUR CONSUMERS ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE. AND THEY ALSO THOSE THAT ALSO NEED A LOT OF SUPPORT AND HELP IN THE COMMUNITY. EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY BEING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING -- I AM VERY PROUD OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE TODAY FOR IN THE REGIONAL CENTER BECAUSE EITHER THE THE THE SHAKERS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THINGS -- TRAINING ON PERSON CENTERED PLANNING -- COLLABORATING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND JUST BEING THERE COMING YOU KNOW JUST CALLING APPARENT WHEN THEY'RE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS AND JUST HOLDING SOMEBODY'S HAND. THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE DO AND I THINK THAT AS AN AGENCY WE ARE FAMILY -- OUR STAFF THEY COME IN THIS DAY AND IF THEY LEAVE THEY COME BACK IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE TO WORK AND I JUST REALLY FEEL THAT. THE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS THE BEST IN THIS NATION. AND I AM COMMITTED FOR LIFE AND I HAVE A GRANDSON SO. AND HE HAS REAP THE BENEFITS OF IT. IN IN AND IF I CAN SAY YOU KNOW -- LIVING AND I HAVE BOTH AND THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER A LONG TIME AND THERE WERE TIMES IT WAS DIFFICULT THERE AND THAT WE HAD ISSUES WITH THAT A HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT. ASIAN AND YOU KNOW OUR ON ITS HAVE BEEN GOOD LATELY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN OUR POSITION FOR AND WE WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO TURN THAT ATTITUDE AROUND. BOTH INTERNALLY AND WITH THE COMMUNITY AND AS YOU KNOW -- IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAD THE TERRORIST ATTACK THERE AND THAT REALLY. IT DID CREATE A LOT OF ANXIETY AND FEAR AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT FOR YOU KNOW THE BRIGHT SIDE OF OF HORRIBLE THINGS -- IT DID PULL US TOGETHER AND IT PULLED THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND A LOT OF THE TREATY -- TRIVIAL ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW SEPARATE PEOPLE DID KIND OF GO BY THE WAYSIDE WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD ON THAT SOMEONE. AND YOU KNOW WE WE TRY TO HAVE -- YOU KNOW REDUCE. THE FEAR AMONG STAFF TO BE CREATIVE AND BE INNOVATIVE AND AND COME UP WITH SOME NEW IDEAS AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. BECAUSE OF OUR OF OUR CASE MANAGERS ARE HAVE A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE THEY'LL BRING THAT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR YEARS AND THAT GOES BACK TO WHEN YOU KNOW THE WHEN I SAY THEY WERE. KIND OF CHEAP AND IF WE HAD A LITTLE WHAT KIND OF PAYING THE PRICE FOR THAT NOW WE'RE TRYING -- TO TRYING TO REVERSE THAT. AND WE THINK WE'VE BEEN SINCE SOME SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL AND AND WE WERE TOP WORKPLACE. TWO YEARS IN A ROW IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. SO WE'RE PROUD OF THAT AND WE'RE PROUD OF THE STAFF THAT WE THANK YOU AGAIN -- FOR YOUR TIME IN LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP AN ONGOING. DIALOGUE -- FOR US TO IMPROVE ON THE AREAS THAT YOU -- SOFT PRETTY. AND I THINK THAT MANY OF THE FOLKS HERE WOULD NOT NOT DISAGREE. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS I WOULD BET THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED IN YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS. SOME OF THINGS THAT SOME PEOPLE HERE DO ALSO LINE WITH TERMS OF THE GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING AT RC THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION I ALSO WANTED AGAIN. THANK YOUR STAFF FOR MY R. C. TO BE HERE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT ON YOUR OWN TIME. TO MEET WITH A COMMUNITY.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US TONIGHT TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS OUR VOICES. I'M THE PROUD SUPERINTENDENT OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS. OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE PROBABLY ONE OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT SPANS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES OF SQUARE. MILES THROUGHOUT THE RIVERSIDE AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES. SO WE'RE DEFINITELY A A DISTRICT I PROMISE WE HAVE A LOT OF NEEDS FOR OUR STUDENTS AND WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HERE. TO TO HEAR OUR VOICE AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES INVOLVED IN OUR STUDENTS AND TONIGHT. AYE AYE WE DO HAVE DOCTOR HOUSE AND WE HAVE THIS IS THAT TWENTY DS LINE -- THIS IS THE ESTÁN DOES WORK WITH OUR DISTRICT IN PARTNERING AND HELPING OUR STUDENTS THAT ARE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES SOMEONE TO PASS THE TIME. HI THANK YOU FOR HAVING US I'M I'M THE DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR THE CONTROL OF A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE HAVE OVER TWENTY TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS. I'M WITH VARYING DISABILITIES WITH OUR STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THE TRANSITIONAL AGE WE REALLY TRY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT -- TO NOT ONLY AT THE SCHOOL BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR WORKABILITY GRANT. THE PURPOSE OF THE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE ARE NOT ONLY TO ASSESS STUDENTS INTERESTS BUT ALSO CONNECT THEM WITH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS I R. C.. OR DOES THE DARK OR POWELL'S THAT ARE WITHIN OUR AREA -- THE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE REALLY FOCUS ON THE STUDENTS THE COMMUNITY AND DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT WE CAN CONNECT THEM WITH -- ARE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES INCLUDE WORKABILITY ARE WORKABILITY GRANT GIVES US ACCESS TO AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HELP SUPPORT -- DOING THESE ASSESSMENTS THROUGHOUT OUR DISTRICT AS WELL AS PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES BRINGING THEM INTO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR TAKING THE STUDENTS TO OTHER PLACES. THE PROGRAM -- FOCUSES ON STUDENTS THAT ARE SIXTEEN TO TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD REALLY LOOKING AT VOCATIONAL INTERESTS PARTNERING THEM WITH JOBS OR A DIFFERENT WORK EXPERIENCES. THROUGH OUR TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO PARTNER WITH TONY DESIGN. AND I'M SHE'S GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES THAT SHE'S BEGAN SUPPORTING OURS STUDENTS WITH THIS YEAR. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM AN ATTORNEY HI ALL MY PRO BONO SIDE OF MY LIKE DEDICATE. MY SERVICES TO ASSISTING INDIVIDUALS WITH. DISABILITIES IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES I TO REGISTER FOR SERVICES I WORK THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BUT I AM FROM THE DESERT I GREW UP HERE THIS IS MY MY LOVE MY HOME -- AND AS I'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON THE DESERT LATELY AND PARTICULAR -- COLLABORATING WITH COULD TELL ABOUT THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THERE ARE UNIQUE -- CHALLENGES TO THIS PARTICULAR DISTRICT THAT DON'T EXIST IN OTHER PARTS OF A CALIFORNIA THAT I HAVE NOTICED -- FIRST -- WHEN I MEET WITH FAMILIES THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKES ME IS THAT THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHO REGIONAL CENTER IS? THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SERVICES ARE. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY AND SO -- THAT'S OBVIOUSLY -- THERE'S A GAP. IN INFORMATION AND SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BIG ISSUE -- ANOTHER ISSUE IS -- IN LARGER CITIES -- BECAUSE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY MORE POPULATED YOU COULD PROBABLY WALK TO REGIONAL CENTER AND THAT'S A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY OR TAKE A BUS OR IN A VERY QUICKLY GET THEIR YOU KNOW HERE. I'M FROM FROM COULD TELL US -- I RC SEVENTY FIVE MILES FROM MECCA AT EIGHTY FIVE MILES AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POPULATION THAT DOES NOT. HAVE CARS IF ANY -- THEY HAVE A SHARED INCOME THEY DON'T HAVE INTERNET. EVEN THOUGH INTERNET FOR ALL HAS BEEN PASSED. THEY DON'T HAVE PHONES TO THEY'LL HAVE EMAIL THE DON'T HAVE SCANNERS -- THE MOVE VERY OFTEN AND SO TO MAINTAIN THAT COMMUNICATION WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. EVEN RECEIVE INFORMATION IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT SO IT'S A UNIQUE CHALLENGE TO THIS POP LUCIEN HERE -- ALSO THE LANGUAGE BARRIER -- THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PART OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO SPANISH IS ACTUALLY THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE THE MY HOPE THIS PARTICULAR DIALECT FROM -- WHERE THEY'RE FROM INTO SPANISH IS IS IT IS CHALLENGING FOR THEM AS IT IS? I'M. WHEN WE ARE ATTEMPTING -- TO REGISTER STUDENTS -- THE PROCESS WELL IN MAY BE EASY FOR SOME PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT A FAMILY WHO DOESN'T HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF EDUCATION OF THE POVERTY. OR MAY HAVE A DISABILITY THEMSELVES APPLYING ONLINE IS DIFFICULT. THEY DON'T HAVE A SCANNER THE TO HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE COMPUTERS -- THAT TO GET THEIR DOCUMENTS FROM SCHOOL SCANNED THEM UPLOAD THEM IT'S VERY CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE AND SO WE'RE TRYING -- TO IN MY COLLABORATION WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FILL BACK UP -- BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A LARGE CAPSULE ANALLY COMING OUT WALK INTO AN OFFICE. AND GET AN APPLICATION AND TALK TO SOMEONE. THEY DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS -- INTERVIEWS INTERNET OR SOCIAL MEDIA. CALLING THE REGIONAL CENTER IS ALSO VERY. VERY CHALLENGING A IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CALL AND GET SOMEONE TO ANSWER -- AND IF YOU'RE CALLING JUST FOR INFORMATION HOW ARE YOU GONNA KNOW FLOOD BUTTON TO PRESS AND WHO TO TALK TO YOU. AND MANY TIMES AGAIN WE'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THAT'S A VERY CHALLENGING PROCESS AND SO -- I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT WOULD BE TO HAVE A LOCAL OFFICE -- TO HAVE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN WALK IN WITH NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS I HAVE TRIED TO ME MANY TIMES -- REGIONAL CENTER REPRESENTATIVES HERE AND THEY HAVE NEVER TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE AN OFFICE OR A PLACE WHERE WE CAN MEET SO WHERE. EITHER MEETING AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ONE THAT'S AN OPTION OR A STARBUCKS OR RESTAURANTEUR ICE CREAM SHOP OR WHATEVER IT IS AND SO. YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGING ASPECT -- I EIGHT I KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- THE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY BUT I REALLY CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW INTERACTION WITH OUR COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS THAT THERE IS AGRICULTURE HERE THE TYPES OF JOBS THAT FAMILIES HAVE HERE -- WHERE THEY COME FROM IT'S JUST A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT TO NOT ONLY DEALING WITH THE DISABILITY ITSELF WHICH IS VERY COMPLICATED OFTEN -- BUT JUST THE FAMILIES AND AND AND THE AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE SO -- COACHELLA HAS DONE A REALLY AMAZING JOB I GETTING THE WORD OUT TO FAMILIES TO REGISTER TO TRY TO GET THEM BEFORE THEY LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL A WHILE THE DOCUMENTS ARE STILL AVAILABLE -- SO I COMMEND THEM FOR MAKING THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I JUST THINK TO ATTACK -- WAY TOO MANY HAVE STATED I THINK THE ACCESSIBILITY PART IS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND WHAT I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO TO THINK ABOUT RESPECTFULLY IS IS ALSO THE THE ASPECTS OF CULTURAL SENSITIVITY AND KEEPING IN MIND THAT A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES SOMETIMES LIVE IN FEAR BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ARE THE POLITICAL CLIMATE -- THAT THEY'RE FACED WITH AND IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO REALLY HAVE -- CONNECTIONS AND I THINK THAT THE REASON WHY WE'VE BEEN -- HEADED TOWARDS A A MORE SUCCESSFUL PATH IS BECAUSE I THINK WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE'RE WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN -- FOR US TO TO HAVE THAT FEASIBILITY THE ACCESSIBILITY AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT HAVING MORE INROADS IN THAT DIRECTION WOULD BE HELPFUL. THE JUST REGARDS TO THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND IN AND REGIONAL CENTERS. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY AS YOU KNOW -- SCHOOL DISTRICT IS IN -- CONSTRUCTION MOLD AND BUILDING IN -- AND RENOVATING FACILITIES THAT THERE COULD BE -- A VIABLE PATH THERE TOO HAVING A PARTNERSHIP -- YOU KNOW A TOOL YOU KNOW PURPOSE FACILITY THAT SERVES THE FAMILIES WITHIN YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS AND HAVING THEM THERE -- ON A ON A FULL TIME PRESENCE IS THAT SOMETHING VIABLE THAT WE CAN PURSUANT. AND IF NOT -- JUST DIRECTLY ON YOUR OWN PERHAPS -- I AS THE AVERAGE KID SACRAMENTO PUSH FOR THIS TYPE OF RESOLUTION BE -- FUNDING MECHANISM THAT COULD ADD TO IN ALL THAT CONVERSATION. OBVIOUSLY WE WE ARE VERY OPEN TO COLLABORATION WERE WERE OPEN TO HAVING JOINT USES FOR FACILITIES AND YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY AND WITH THE PURPOSE OF A BOND. BUT WE WOULD BE COMPLETELY OPEN TO THAT SUPPORTS AND HAVING THAT THAT DIFFERENCE AYE LAYER. OF IF FUNDING PERHAPS FROM THE STATE -- I THINK THAT WOULD BE POWERFUL AND I THINK THAT WOULD MEAN A LOT OF OUR NEEDS HERE IN THE VALLEY. THANK YOU ARE TWO YEARS AGO WE AUTHORED LEGISLATION THAT CAME FROM PARENTS OF SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS. THAT WANTED -- TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- TO ON THEIR APPLICATIONS A CONDITION THE BOX THE INFORMATION. THAT -- PARENTS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION REGARDING THE ID PEAS -- A FEW DAYS IN ADVANCE -- I GIVEN THAT THOSE ARE WORKING -- DOCUMENTS IN PROGRESS BUT THAT MANY TIMES -- CONSIDERING -- THE POPULATION AT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN THE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY. THE THE FACT IS IS THAT -- THE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED THAT THE DAY OF THE MEETING -- IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO TAKE IN AND MAKE A A AND DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S THE PLAN MOVING FORWARD -- THE FOR THE GOVERNOR OF VETO THE BILL ST THAT TO MAYBE THAT COULD BE TOO REDUNDANT. I'M TOO MUCH WORK FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS I DIDN'T THINK SO -- BUT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT -- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS DOING. A TO ENSURE THAT THAT -- INFORMATION IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE -- IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING ABLE TO DIGEST IT A BIT AND GO INTO A CONVERSATION. A LITTLE MORE INFORMED AND EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED TO YOU AS A STUDENT I KNOW I IT COMES TO MIND AS I RC REPS SAID THEY ARE AT THE TABLE WHEN THESE IDPS ARE BEING. DEVELOPED -- PARENTS ARE AT THE TABLE BUT MANY TIMES NOT -- MENTALLY -- PREPARED TO MAKE THAT DECISION BECAUSE I JUST GOT THIS DOCUMENT. THAT SAYS THIS IS THE PLAN OF ACTION WE FOR COULD YOU CAME IN ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE PARENT THE REQUEST TO HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION EARLY ABSOLUTELY IS PROVIDED IT -- WE ALSO PROVIDE TRANSLATORS AT EVERY I. P. TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSLATION AND THERE'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE DOCUMENT. I'M AT ANY TIME IF RECENT OR NEED TO BE TAKEN OUR RECONVENE MEETINGS NEED TO BE RE CONVENE WITH NO SO TO THAT. OF WE REALLY WANT THE PARENTS TO BE A PART OF IT. AND WANTED TO BE A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO THE HIGHER SEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ME.

YOU KNOW MY FRIENDS WOULD BE PLAYING RUNNING JUMPING IN YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE THINGS CAME EASY EASY TO THEM AND CAN DO THAT SOME. BUT AS I GOT OLDER YOU KNOW I I REALIZE THAT IT'S YOU KNOW -- THAT I CAN JUST OVERCOME IT YOU KNOW. AND JUST. LIVE WITH IT AND ONCE I GOT INTO HIGH SCHOOL I REALLY JUST STARTED TO QUESTION WHAT MY PURPOSE WAS. YOU KNOW LIVING WITH HIS DISABILITY -- AND I JUST LEARNED OVER TIME THAT. IT'S OKAY TO BE DIFFERENT. IT'S OKAY. TO HAVE A WALKER YOU KNOW IT. IT'S IT'S A PART OF YOU BUT IT DOESN'T DEFINE YOU [INAUDIBLE] AND ONCE I LEARNED THAT AND THEN THAT'S WHEN I REALLY STARTED TO LEARN THAT I WANTED. TO BECOME INDEPENDENT. AND START LIVING FOR ME.

IN SOCIETY -- I WILL BE LABELED CRIPPLED. TO SOME DIFFERENT THINGS MENTALLY YOU KNOW CHALLENGED. AND JUST STUFF LIKE THAT JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT THE FEE BASED OF BASED OFF OF WHAT THEY SEE.

TO DESERT SANDS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT I AM NOT GOING TO PUT HIM IN THE TRANSITION PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S VERY -- ITS DEEDS A LOT OF WORK AND THEY SHOULD BE GOING OUT COMMUNITY AND I COULD PROBABLY TEACH A MORE THAN DO THAT I'M GOING TO BRING TO MY DISTRICT PALM SPRINGS IT HAS A FANTASTIC. PROGRAM SO I JUST WANNA SEE I SAY THAT I THINK IN REGIONAL CENTER. WOULD BE GREAT FOR THAT COLLABORATION IT SOUNDS COACHELLA VALLEY SOUNDS OF THIS SOUNDS REALLY GOOD COLLABORATING WITH I RC BUT I THINK ALSO TO HAVE REPRESENTATIVES THAT COULD HELP. ARE YOUR C. LIKE SCHOOL NURSES LIKE ME BECAUSE I GO TO MEETINGS NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT OUR SEE I'M TALKING THE TEACHERS. THE STAFF. I KNOW THE NUMBER BY HEART SOUL GIVEN TO THE PARENT THE PARENT HAS I AND WHAT I SAY IN THIS MAY BE DIFFERENT MAYBE ARE SO YOU CAN TELL ME. I SEE THAT THE PARENT HAS TO BE YOU THAT CONTACTS ARE C. BUT THEY'RE VERY NERVOUS OR LIKE THERE'S OTHER ISSUES -- SO THERE'S A LINK THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT TOGETHER. AND THEN LASTLY -- I WANT TO SAY IT'S NOT JUST CULTURAL INS INS. SENSITIVITY IT'S ALSO LIKE ME. I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH BUT I'VE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME NAVIGATING THE SYSTEM. AND I'M AN EDUCATED PERSON I'M A SCHOOL NURSE. I'VE WORKED VERY HARD TO BALANCE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PARENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED A LOT BUT FOR ME I KNOW I CAN DO IT NOW BUT ALL THESE OTHER PARENTS. AND OTHERS OF IT BUT I WANT TO SAY OURS ARE YOUR SEIZE COME A LONG WAY. I HAVE A FANTASTIC CASE WORKER WITH MY SON AND I'VE TOLD THE GRAMS SPECIALISTS OF I'M GONNA RIDE RECOMMENDATION FOR HER. MAY I HAVE COME A LONG WAY THANK YOU. SPEAKER. YOUR NAME MY NAME IS LAURA GREGOR THIS IS WHEN AT BRANDON BROWNER WE BOTH HAVE CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY ADULTS IN THE ADULT TRANSITION PROGRAM WITH DESERT SANDS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- WERE BOTH SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN THE PROGRAM IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADULT PROGRAM THAT TEACHES INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS VOCATIONAL SKILLS. I SOCIALISE ATION SKILLS. AND I'M NOT BLAMING THE TEACHERS I COMPLETELY BLAME THE DISTRICT THERE IN A CLASSROOM THAT DOESN'T HAVE A KITCHEN SETTING IT DOESN'T HAVE THE USE THAT ARE. COOKTOP ENACT CAMPING SINK TO CLEAN THE DISHES -- THERE ARE STRIVING. TO OBTAIN JOBS FOR THESE STUDENTS TO GET JOB TRAINING THEY'RE NOT GIVEN SUPPORT BY THE DISTRICT FIND THESE JOBS. THEY'RE NOT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN HIM AND REGIONAL CENTER DEPARTMENT OF REHAB AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. BECAUSE THE TEACHER SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND FIND THESE JOBS. AND THEY DO AND NOW THE TEACHERS ARE HAVING TO GET TERRITORIAL ABOUT WHERE THE JOBS ARE WHICH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE EITHER -- WHERE I'VE ALSO BEEN HEARING RUMORS THAT THEY'RE MOVING THE PROGRAM THERE RIGHT NOW IT'S AN TO SCHOOL SITES IN THE DISTRICT? SO IT'S AT THEIR INDIA TYPICAL EDUCATION CENTERS LIKE IN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL SUMMIT HIGH SCHOOL AND WE LIKE THAT THEY'RE VERY INTEGRATED WITH THE STUDENTS. NOW THE DISTRICT IS TALKING ABOUT PUTTING THEM IN A SEPARATE SETTING WAY OFF IN THE BOWELS OF INDIA AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED -- AGAIN THERE'S NO KITCHEN THERE I DON'T KNOW WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BENEFIT OF MOVING THEM WOULD BE. THEY'VE THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT IT'S GOING TO BE MORE LIKE COLLEGE SETTING BUT IF THEY WANT TO COLLEGE SETTING WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL COD CAMPUS OUT HERE WHY CAN'T WE MOVE THEM OVER THERE. SO WE'RE JUST VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ADULT PROGRAM IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADULT TRAINING PROGRAM AND DOLE TRANSITION PROGRAM. AND I JUST FEEL THE TEACHERS JUST DO NOT GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED FROM THE DISTRICT AND IT'S A SHAME [INAUDIBLE] ABOUT THAT. THE DISTRICT HAS NOT CONTACTED APPEARANCE THEY HAVEN'T EVEN CONTACTED THAN ADULTS I MEAN I CHILDREN THEY'RE ADULTS. AND THEY HAVE RIGHTS IN WE HAVE RIGHTS THEY HAVEN'T ASKED US ANYTHING WE'RE HEARING THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE THAT THEY'VE ALREADY FILLED IS STILL TO MOVE THEM. AND TRANSITION THE LECTURE. SO IT AFFECTS THEIR JOB SITES IT AFFECTS THEIR TRANSPORTATION IT'S NOT IN THE BEST AREA THAT'S NOT MY BIGGEST CONCERN BUT THE TEACHERS JUST HEARING FROM THE TEACHERS THEY DON'T WANT THIS MOVE. BUT THEY FEEL THEY HAVE NO CHOICE AND THEY FEEL THEY HAVE NO VOICE THE TEACHERS. WHERE THE VOICE THANK YOU GOOD EVENING. AB. I'M TO ME DESIGNER CHAIR OF UNITED CEREBRAL PALSY THE AN EMPIRE AND A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER EIGHTEEN YEARS. BUT I SPEAK. FOR THE HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES WE SERVE. WE SERVE OVER THREE HUNDRED TO A RESPITE CARE PROGRAM AND FAR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED WITH OTHER SERVICES. IN OUR WHAT WE WOULD REALLY LIKE WHAT WE NEED IS AN 8% INCREASE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR A RESPITE WORKERS. THEY PROVIDE SO MUCH IN THE WAY OF SKILLS AND RELATIONSHIP FOSTERING. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A WAITING LIST OF FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE CLIENTS IN NEED OF RESPITE SERVICES. AND IS ONE WHO IS. WHO HAS BEEN BORN WITH THAT SERVER FALLS IN UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES IN THE NEEDLE SUPPORT SERVICES OFFER? HOW CAN OURS -- RESPITE WORKERS WHO LOVE WHAT THEY DO THEY LOVE OUR KIDS AND AND HELPING OUR FAMILIES HOW CAN THEY DO IT -- WITH WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN FAMILIES THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. AND YET THEY HARDLY HAVE A LIVABLE WAGE HAVE TO WORK TWO THREE JOBS IN MANY OF THE MOVE ON TO OTHER JOBS AND HAVE TO LEAVE OUR ORGANIZATION. AS A RESULT OF THE LOW PAY -- YES WE HAVE A HIGH TURNOVER RATE WE NEED WE NEED EXPERIENCED QUALITY RESPITE WORKERS WHO WANT TO STAY WITH US. AND PAUSES RELATIONSHIPS FOR OUR KIDS. AND THIS IS. REALLY THE LEAST WE CAN DO CURRENTLY ARE INNOVATION STANDS TO LOSE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM. AND 90% LOSS SO THE 8% INCREASE IS. VERY NECESSARY WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR PROGRAMS THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY STORES IN WOMEN.

HI MY NAME'S BARBARA TYLER. I'M SO THRILLED THAT WE HAVE TWO INTERPRETERS HERE TODAY. OF SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS THANKS -- TO ASSEMBLYMAN. FRAZIER AND GARCIA -- I DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT THE DEAF COMMUNITY AND FACT I THINK YOU'RE KIND OF JUST LEARNING ABOUT ALL THE DISABILITY SO MY RIGHT. IT IS HERE'S A LEARNING PROCESS FOR YOU GUYS AND I REALLY COMMEND YOU FOR IT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR INTEREST IN YOUR CARE. SO MY BROTHER PATRICK IS AN OVER THERE IN THE FRONT AND HE IS STAFF PROFOUNDLY DEAF. AND HAVE SEVERAL POLICY AND IN THE MEANTIME IN THEM IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HE HAD SOMETHING LIKE SPINAL MENINGITIS WHICH HAS CAUSED. MORE BRAIN DAMAGE. SO HE'S A LONG TERM CLIENT OF REGIONAL CENTER. AND I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE DEAF COMMUNITY THEY JUST CAN'T GET HERE. AND I THINK THERE'S ONE OF OUR REGIONAL CENTER -- CASE WORKERS ERIC. BACK THERE WHO'S FAMILIAR HE KNOWS THAT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW. SO. THE THE THE CRITERIA TO TO BE A REGIONAL CENTER CLIENT. IS SEVERAL POLICY SEIZURES. EPILEPSY -- INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. AND PROBABLY I THINK THE OTHER ONE IS HEALTH IMPAIRED RIGHT BUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE DEAFNESS. AND IT DOESN'T INCLUDE BLINDNESS HOWEVER. MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE ONE DISABILITY. HAVE A VISUAL HANDICAP OR DEAF DEAFNESS HIM. HEARING HIM. AND SO -- I WANTED CHALLENGE HERE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A BIG PUSH. TO MAINSTREAM EVERYBODY AND SMALL GROUP HOUSING GET PEOPLE OUT OF INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE TOUGH. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT BEING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I'M A TWO STAR RETIRED TEACHER THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING AND LIFELONG ADVOCATE FOR MY BROTHER SO. IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING NEW TO ME HOWEVER IT IS NEW TO MOST OF THE PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE AND EVEN EDUCATORS THAT YOU WORK WITH. THEY DON'T HAVE THE INSIGHT THAT YOU GUYS HAVE. AS PARENTS AND AND FAMILY MEMBERS THAT LIVE WITH THIS EVERY DAY I RECOMMEND YOU. FOR TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT IT. SO -- LIKE THEY WERE ARRESTED. IS SEVEN TIMES UP. I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE SENSES BUT WE HAVE A SENSE IS I HAVE A STATEMENT FROM THE JEFF COMMUNITY SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED -- INSTEAD OF BEING MAINSTREAMED OUT WITH HEARING THEY WANT TO BE MAINSTREAMED WITH THEIR PEERS WITH THEIR CULTURE WITH THEIR DEAF CULTURE. AND WE'RE SO THRILLED TO HAVE SOME. VERY IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE DEAF COMMUNITY IN RIVERSIDE TO BE HERE TODAY TO EXPLAIN THAT TO HEAR THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU SO MUCH [INAUDIBLE] HELLO.

AND OTHER RESIDENTS WHO ARE SEVERELY -- WOULD HAVE SEVEREST DISCIPLINE TO CEREBRAL PALSY. WE ALSO -- USE SIGN LANGUAGE DIRECTLY. AND I HAVE TO SAY IS THE WORD DIRECTLY NOT INDIRECTLY USING AN INTERPRETER BETWEEN US. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOSE AN INTERPRETER BETWEEN YOU THERE'S A LOSS IN THE COMMUNICATION. THE CARE GIVERS. HAVE DIRECT COMMUNICATION INCLUDING NURSES. GROUNDSKEEPERS ADMINISTRATION. ALL OF THEM USE GOT SIGN LANGUAGE. AND THERE'S A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR GUIDANCE FROM YOUR COMMITTEE. TO HELP US FIND SOME FUNDING.

AND WOULD LIKE FOR THEM TO COME AND HELP US AND SEE IF THEY CAN PROVIDE SOME OPTIONS TO US. WHERE CAN WE WE CAN STAY STRONG? I ARE DEAF CULTURE IS VERY STRONG. WE USE SIGN LANGUAGE TO COMMUNICATE. AND WE CANNOT HAVE MARGINALIZED COMMUNICATION. WE HAVE TO HAVE FULL COMMUNICATION. AND WHEN WE LOSE OUR COMMUNICATION WITH THESE ARE ACCESS TO THE WORLD. SO WE NEED TO STAY TOGETHER AS A DRAFT GROUP IS A DEAF CULTURE THAT'S A TOUGH COMMUNITY WE CANNOT BE ISOLATED WE CANNOT BE ALONE. WHEN WE ARE ALONE WE HAVE NO COMMUNICATION IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT SO WE HAVE STAFF HERE? AT THE HOUSE THAT WE NEED TO BERMAN MAIN. AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WILL HELP US REMAIN STABLE STABLE AND FEASIBLE.

DISABLED CHILD WITH AUTISM IT'S IT'S QUITE HARD AGAIN HE WORKS VERY HARD AND I JUST. HAVE TO SPEAK FOR MY HUSBAND SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. YOU. GOOD EVENING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MY NAME IS LAURIE AND ROTH AND I'M VERY INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY. I AM OUT OVER VOLUNTEER I GET PAID FOR NOTHING. THIS IS MY SON ANDREW HE'S SEVERELY MULTIPLY DISABLED MEDICALLY FRAGILE. AND BLIND. I AM ON THE BOARD FOR A NIGHT'S REBEL PALSY AS A TRUSTEE. AGAIN AGAIN NO PAYMENT FOR ANYTHING. AND WE'VE RECEIVED NO SERVICES. BUT I DO THIS FOR OTHER FAMILIES. THE REASON I GOT INVOLVED IS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OF OUR FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE SERVICES. I AM ALSO ON THAT. SPECIAL EDUCATION -- SELF BY FOR OUR COUNTY I AM A COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBER AS WELL AND I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR I THINK EIGHTEEN YEARS AND THE NON PROFITS AND ARE VALLEY HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP TO HELP WITH A LOT OF SERVICES THAT DISAPPEARED YEARS AGO. SO NOW. WE'RE TRYING TO HELP OUT WHERE WE CAN THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY THINGS AND NONPROFITS CAN DO. THE OTHER PART OF IT NEEDS TO COME FROM. OBVIOUSLY NEW VENDORS FOR REGIONAL CENTER AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH. WE NEED NEW VENDORS WE NEED A LOT OF THEM WE NEED THEM FOR THE ADULT SERVICES REALLY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY KIDS. THEIR TRANSITIONING INTO THOSE ADULT SERVICES AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY SERVICES ON THIS SIDE OF THE VALLEY WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FOR THE KIDS BUT WE HAVE SERVICES. BUT THE KIDS NEED. ARE THE ADULTS NEED MORE ABILITY TO GET INTO PROGRAMS THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT AVAILABLE HERE. SO WE NEED THOSE VENDORS. WE ALSO NEED EMPLOYER INCENTIVES SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP. WITH OUR KIDS GETTING A JOB SOME KIND OF WEIGHTS AND GIVEN AND SENT IT TO THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE EMPLOYERS THAT WANTED DO STUFF BUT IT'S IT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT. TO GET THEM TO REALLY WANT TO GET OUR KIDS A JOB. AND SO IF WE GAVE THEM SOME KIND OF INCENTIVE THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY HIRE MORE OF OUR KIDS WHICH IS PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO WITH THE STATE. THE OTHER PART IS THAT. WE HAVE MEDICAL ISSUES OUT HERE. BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR KIDS HAVE REALLY SEVERE MEDICAL NEEDS. AND THERE ARE NO MEDICAL REAL PLACES TO GO OUT HERE FOR SPECIALISTS. A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES GO TO MELINDA WE GO TO CHILDREN'S LA. PEOPLE GO TO SAN DIEGO ORANGE COUNTY. SO FAR THE PROBLEM IS TRANSPORTATION. TO APPROPRIATE MEDICAL CARE. SO THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT FOR THE FUTURE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE IT REALLY SHOWS A LOT OF INITIATIVE. FOR ME I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU FOR COMING AND REALLY LISTENING BECAUSE IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT FOR US TO ALL BE TOGETHER ON THIS. AND THAT'S THE REASON I DO SO MUCH OF MY COMMUNITY AS A VOLUNTEER BECAUSE IT TAKES A VILLAGE. AND I AM PROUD TO BE PART OF REGIONAL CENTER I AM PART PROUD TO BE PART OF UNITED CEREBRAL PALSY I AM PROUD TO BE. PART OF MY DISTRICT SPECIAL EDUCATION PARENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH I CO FOUNDED. SIXTEEN YEARS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NICK SPEAKER PLEASE. ARE YOU FEELING THE PASSION IN THE ROOM. YES. I RENEE GRIFFIN AND I'M A PARENT OF A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD THOSE ARE SOME OF MY FRIENDS HERE. AND ALL THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE BEHIND THEM ARE WONDERFUL SUPPORT PEOPLE -- FROM DESERT ARE CAN INLAND REGIONAL I FORTUNATELY HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THEM AND REGIONAL THANK YOU. ADD WITH DESERT ARC AS WELL. ACTIVE VOLUNTEER PARENT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND YOU WERE ABLE TO HEAR FROM THOSE WHO CAN ADVOCATE. I CAN'T HEAR FROM THE THOUSANDS WHO CAN'T ADVOCATE. BUT THERE ARE GROWING. IF YOU COULD WITNESS THE GROWTH FROM AND THE VALUE THAT THEY HAVE FOUND IN THEMSELVES. FROM ALL THE SUPPORT THAT THEY GET FROM ALL OF THESE WONDERFUL -- ORGANIZATIONS HERE -- THERE ARE A LOT OF US WHO VOLUNTEER ON A ROAD. THAT AREN'T VENDOR. THAT WILL DO ANYTHING WE CANNOT HOLD ACTIVITIES OR PROGRAMS FOR OUR OUR CHILDREN WHO NEED TO HAVE THAT. YOU DEAR IS ONE OF THEM SHE HAS A REALLY OUTSTANDING DOWN SYNDROME GROUP. I HAVE A DANCE TROUPE AND WE'RE ALL DOING THAT. VOLUNTARILY TO HELP OUR CHILDREN. SO I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS. MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND. AND SO WHERE ARE BEGGING YOU TO PLEASE GO BACK GET THAT FINANCING WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S GONNA BE SOME NEW COMMUNITY BASED INITIATIVES COMING OUT. THESE THAT HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO VOTE TO COMPLY. IN ORDER TO COMPLY THE NEEDS MONEY. AND IF YOU COULD HELP GET THAT FUNDING INCREASE GET THE STAFF THEY NEED GET THE PROGRAMS IN PLACE. YOU'VE GOT ONE WHICH IS COMMUNITY GOING HERE. GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING I'D JUST BRIEFLY -- MY NAME IS ROB MORROW AND I AM A VENDOR -- THE INLAND REGIONAL CENTER AND I WANNA THINK THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS OFFICE FOR TAKING THE TIME TO GIVE US THIS PLATFORM. AT THIS EVENING -- IT'S GREAT TO SEE -- SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE GATHERING TO SPEAK ABOUT THESE VERY IMPORTANT AND NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY -- BRIEFLY AS A VENDOR. I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE. TO AFFORD TO PAY. A DIRECT STAFF AS A A QUALITY LIVING WAGE. AND UNFORTUNATELY -- THE THE RATES HERE LOCALLY THEY'RE SUCH A LARGE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE RATES HERE AND I SERVE OTHER. REGIONAL CENTERS AND IS THIS COMMUNITY IS ACTUALLY -- NOT ANY LESS EXPENSIVE TO SERVE SO -- I'VE I'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT THE RACE STUDY AND NO WE APPRECIATE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REIMBURSE OUR DIRECT STAFF AND GIVE THEM ARE REALLY GOOD. A BETTER QUALITY OF LIVING THROUGH A DIRECT SERVICE WAGE -- SECONDLY I JUST WANTED TO TO LET EVERYBODY HERE KNOW THAT. I'M A VENDOR. OF AND ALSO A FAMILY MEMBER OF A PERSON WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL NEED. AT DISABILITY AND MÁS WHEN ADVOCATE SO FOR MY ADVOCATE HAD ON JUST BRIEFLY. AND I WANTED TO SPEAK UP JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM. CLIENTS OF MINE. AND PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY IN RELATION. TO ACCESSIBILITY TO THE REGIONAL CENTER -- THE DRIVE FROM HERE DECEMBER DINO IS. IT'S A IT'S A REALLY HEAVY LIFT FOR FOLKS AND PEOPLE COMMONLY REFERRED TO THAT LOCATION AS FOR IRC BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A LARGE BUILDING AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO -- YOU HAVE TO HAVE EMAIL -- YOU HAVE TO HAVE MADE A RESERVATION IF YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO SOMEBODY. AND ON MANY OCCASIONS I'VE HAD PARENTS TAKE THE DAY OFF WORK FROM THE FIELDS TO BE ABLE TO GET DOWN THERE. GET A LIFT. AND THEY JUST ARE PROVIDED ACCESS SO -- IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF COLLABORATION WITH -- MAYBE SOMEBODY WITH THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IF -- IF AN ACTUAL SITE IS NOT -- SOMETHING IN THE IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE FAMILIES BE ABLE TO REACH OUT AND AND MEET. THE CASE MANAGERS OVER AT THE REGIONAL CENTER AND HAVE THAT DIRECT ACCESS. AS A VENDOR I'VE BEEN OUT IN THE REGIONAL CENTER SITE AND THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS. HAD I NOT BEEN ABLE TO PULL UP MY EMAIL FROM MY CELL PHONE AND VERIFY THAT ACTUALLY HAD AN APPOINTMENT. I WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRESENT A FEW PIECES OF PAPER THAT I WAS DROPPING OFF -- IT WAS AN HOUR OUT OF THE WAY FROM FROM VALLEY SO I JUST WANTED TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW IT'S A CONCERN FOR MANY PEOPLE IN THE IN THE VALLEY HERE. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT -- NO ANSWER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK. WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME IF THERE'S ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT COME UP PUBLIC COMMENT -- MIKE IS OPEN -- HI PHIL SIGN AGAIN AND I WOULD LIKE TO THINK LAURIE WHO CAME UP WITH AND SHOES SHE WAS THE MENTOR I WAS REFERRING. TO ALONG WITH BEING INVOLVED FOR THE SIXTEEN YEARS I DO HAVE A SON THAT WENT THROUGH THE TRANSITION PROGRAM. THE TRANSITION PROGRAM THROUGH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH I UNDERSTAND HOW 2% THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE BUT MAYBE YOU GENTLEMEN CAN HELP WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION -- IT'S ALMOST -- FOR THE MOST PART A BABY SITTING SITUATION. I BROUGHT UP TO THE I BROUGHT UP THE THE THE ISSUE SEVERAL YEARS AGO -- ABOUT HAVING THE ROOM SET OFF FOR A STUDIO APARTMENT -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT A BID WOULD NOT BE PUT IN THERE BECAUSE OF THE OF RAMIFICATIONS THAT COULD BE. HAD WITH SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS NOT NECESSARILY UNDERSTANDING WHAT MAY BE GOING ON BUT WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING A BOX THERE SAYING THIS IS A BAD. COULD HAVE THE KITCHEN COULD HAVE THE DISHWASHER AND THE WASHING -- NEEDS FOR LAUNDRY. AND ONE OTHER COMMENT THE HAVE A DISCUSSION THE OTHER EVENING AT THIS UP -- AWARDS CEREMONY I SPOKE TO SOON AND BLOCK WHOSE WITH DESERT SANDS. AND ONE OF HER CONCERNS WAS WITH INLAND REGIONAL CENTER IS THAT THEY ARE AM I A AT TIMES FROM THIS IN THE VALLEY YOU'VE HEARD MANY PARENTS SAY. THAT THEY HAVE NOT COME TO THEIR AYE EE PEAS. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THAT BUT THAT MAY BE ONE AREA THAT NEEDS WORK. ALONG WITH OF ONE OTHER AREA IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND MY WORK WITH THE THE SOFA IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS. EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO MAYBE SO MADE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS TO GET HELP FROM IN THE REGIONAL CENTER. AND MAYBE WE NEED AN EDUCATION PROGRAM WITH THAT IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF THE UNDER SO THAT THE CONSUMER UNDERSTANDS. THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH ALL THE RED TAPE AND THEN GETTING AN ANSWER THAT MAY NOT BE -- THE ONE THEY WANT TO HEAR -- THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE SITUATIONS OF FIRST OF ALL I I I THINK IT'S UP TO YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE SO I THINK YOU NOW -- BUT MAYBE WE NEED TO GET INVOLVED WITH THE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO MR FRAZIER IS GET INTO THE OF WITH THE THE SCHOOL. THE THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT SO THAT YOU'D WORK TOGETHER YOU WOULD HAVE THAT PARTNERSHIP -- AND WITH THEM HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING [INAUDIBLE] IT'S IT'S A BIG OPPORTUNITY AND A HOPE THAT YOU WILL FINISH UP WITH WHAT WE'VE STATED THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I APPRECIATE HAVING EXTRA TIME. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY ONE STATE PLAN. ARE YOU HAVE YOU GUYS READ THAT PLAN. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE PLAN THE RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE IN THE PLAN THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE I'M GONNA TELL YOU -- ONLY ABOUT 5%. OF THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN OUR STATE ARE FIVE AND UNDER. AND YET OVER THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX PROBABLY OVER 240% NOW OUR SENIORS. SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER. AND THEN -- PERHAPS YOU KNOW THAT AS YOU AGE YOU START LOSING YOUR HEARING LIKE ME. I'M HARD OF HEARING AND YOU LOST YEARS. SO MOST SENIORS TO HAVE A HEARING LOSS HOWEVER THE STATE PLAN THAT YOU GUYS ARE UNDER. THEY NEVER INQUIRED ANYTHING WITH THE DEATH AND ARE DEAF NEEDS ARE ANY INTERESTS ARE DEAF CULTURE. ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT. THE MAINSTREAM CULTURE IS NOW THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO GET UP HERE AND TELL YOU THAT. AND I REALLY WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD CALL ME SO I CAN EXPLAIN IT MORE THE SECOND THING IS THERE'S A THERE'S A GRANT -- GOING ON NOW 440-050-000 DOLLARS IF YOU HAVE AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM. I TRIED TO GET THE GRANT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN CHARGE OF THE GRANT AND IT'S LIKE YOU ALREADY HAVE TO HAVE A PROGRAM. SO HERE WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT CAN SERVE. MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE MULTIPLE DISABILITIES THEY'RE WELCOMING OUR TURF. JILL CENTER CLIENTS THANK GOD WHO ELSE WELCOMES AND THE DEATH THE STAFF IS DAMPER BRINGS DEATH. BUT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN GET YOU CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE GIVING THIS GRANT SO I REALLY FEEL. AS A TAXPAYER YOU KNOW VETERAN FAMILY. AND ARGUES. THAT WE DESERVE TO HELP SOME OF THE STATE MONEY FOR OUR PEOPLE THERE HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS. AND THEY NEED A SPECIAL PLACE THAT THAT SUITS THEIR CULTURE THANK YOU AND I STOPPED TAKING. WE HAVE ONE MORE SPEAKER ONE MORE. FIRST OF ALL I REALLY LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR BEING OUT HERE BRINGING THIS TO THE COACHELLA VALLEY I WAS -- THE PROUD ENOUGH TO BE AT YOUR PRESENTATION IN RIVERSIDE AND I THINK WE'VE GOT A BIGGER TURNOUT. THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE HERE THAN IT WAS REVERSED. CONGRATULATIONS I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT. THE NEXT TIME WE DO THIS LET'S EVERYBODY BRING ONE MORE PERSON -- WHAT I DO THINK IS THAT? A LOT OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD TONIGHT -- IT IS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION.

I RC AND THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN ON BOARD ALONG WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. SO THAT IS IN ITSELF IS GONNA PROBABLY DO SOME REALLY GOOD STUFF. FOR ALL OF THE THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD I HAD A REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH I RC HAVE WORKED WITH THEM. FOR I WANT TO SAY THIRTY YEARS BUT I I THINK. ANOTHER POINT TO BE MADE HERE IS THAT THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE YESTERDAY DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF PUSHING FORWARD NOT ONLY THE THING IS THAT WERE IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES BUDGET. BUT ALSO THE THE PUT FORTH MOTION. TO CARRY FORTH THAT 8% ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL SERVICES. THE GOVERNOR DID PUT INTO HIS BUDGET. SOME RATE INCREASES FOR SOME OF THE THE SPECIFIC SERVICES BUT NOT FOR ALL. AND THE MOTION WAS MADE AND AND WHEN MADE IT THROUGH. THE SUBCOMMITTEE.

IN ACHIEVING SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT TODAY THAT THAT DON'T REQUIRE. A LOT OF MONEY THEY REQUIRE CHANGING OF SOME RULES TO MAKE A GRANT MORE ACCESSIBLE. RIGHT THEY REQUIRE A TO A GREATER COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN MAYBE THE REGIONAL CENTER AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO POTENTIALLY PROVIDE OF PERMANENT PRESENCE. HERE.
