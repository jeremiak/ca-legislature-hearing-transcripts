THERMODYNAMICS CLASS AND THE

FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:47.113
WHICH- EXPLAINS THAT ENERGY IS

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.083
CONSERVED. AND SO ON EARTH IF

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:51.784
WE DRAW CONTROL VOLUME AROUND

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.286
THIS WE ONLY HAVE A FEW THINGS

00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:54.287
THAT CROSSED THIS CONTROL

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.255
VOLUME. THE PRIMARY ONE GOING

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:57.690
IN AND THROUGH THIS CONTROL

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.992
VOLUME A SOLAR RADIATION. SOME

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:01.894
OF THAT IS REFLECTED BACK OUT

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.863
IN THE SAME WAVELENGTH SPECTRUM

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.532
AS THE SUNS- WAVELENGTHS

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.068
THEMSELVES. AND THEN OTHER

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.837
RADIATION IS READING IT BACK

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.238
THROUGH THE CONTROL VOLUME OUT

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.806
TO SPACE IN A DIFFERENT

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.375
WAVELENGTH REGIME. BECAUSE THE

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:19.479
EARTH IS AT MUCH LOWER

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:20.213
TEMPERATURE THAN THE SUN. AND

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.949
OVER THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH.

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:24.984
THERE HAS BEEN THIS BALANCE

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.820
ALWAYS AND FOREVER THAT ANY

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.423
CHANGE AND ENERGY ON THE EARTH.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.291
HAS THIS SOLAR RADIATION COMING

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:33.326
AND MINUS THAT WHICH IS

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:34.927
REFLECTED MONISTAT WHICH IS RE

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:39.565
RADIATED BACK OUT TO SPACE. AND

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.400
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.569
PRIMARY ENERGY RESOURCES THAT

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.872
WE TEND TO CONVERT HERE ON

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:47.807
EARTH HAVE COME FROM THIS

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.376
AMAZING BALANCE. WE'VE SEEN

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.178
OVER HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.313
YEARS TO MILLIONS OF YEARS DEAD

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.515
PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE WITH THE

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.450
HEAT AND PRESSURE AGAIN BY THE

00:06:57.517 --> 00:07:00.119
POWER OF THE SUN CONVERTED TO

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:03.055
FOSSIL FUELS LIKE COAL OIL AND

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:07.193
NATURAL GAS. AND THESE HAVE.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.062
TAKES SO LONG TO MAKE ON EARTH

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.764
THAT I HAVE TO DRAW HASH MARKS

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.733
THROUGH THIS TIME FRAME.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.002
BECAUSE ALL OF THE OTHER FORMS

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:19.338
OF PRIMARY ENERGY ARE-REPLENISHED NATURALLY ON EARTH

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:21.407
IN A MUCH SHORTER TIME FRAME SO

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.242
THINGS LIKE CORN TREES GRASS

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:26.245
USUALLY TAKE MONTHS OR YEARS TO

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.714
MAKE BIO ENERGY. IN THE FORM OF

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.818
ETHANOL OR BIO GAS OR BIO.

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:34.654
HYDROPOWER SUN POWER EVAPORATES

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.622
THE WATERS MAKES THE CLOUDS IN

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:37.990
THE CLOUDS RAIN ON TO THE HILLS

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.892
AND WE HAVE HYDROPOWER BUT THIS

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.794
TAKES ORDER OF MAGNITUDE WEEKS

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.796
TO MONTHS TO OCCUR AND WIND

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:45.865
POWER AGAIN BY THE POWER OF THE

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.667
SUN WE CREATE THESE PRESSURE

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:48.701
TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS THAT

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:50.036
BRITISH PRESSURE GRADIENTS AND

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.572
THE WIND BLOWS. BUT SOMETIMES

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:56.609
IT DOESN'T BLOW FOR DAYS. OR

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:59.011
EVEN WEEKS. WHEN SOLAR POWER IS

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:00.613
THE MOST PREDICTABLE AND

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.915
RELIABLY RETURN FORM OF ENERGY

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.650
THE INSTEAD WE USE A UNIT OF

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:07.453
SUN ENERGY UP. IT IS RETURNED

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.291
TO US. AT LEAST DURING THE DAY.

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:12.758
SO FROM AN ENGINEERING

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:15.494
PERSPECTIVE. IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:18.364
THAT ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.333
REQUIRES THAT WE CONVERT THESE

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:23.502
RESOURCES AT THE SAME RATE AT

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:25.371
WHICH- IS NATURALLY REPLENISHES

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:28.941
THEM. THIS IS A SIMPLE ENERGY

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:32.678
BALANCE. I ALSO ADDED THAT IT

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:33.779
SHOULD BE DONE WITHOUT

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:37.884
EXTERNALITIES. SO THIS IS HOW

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.985
WE ARE DOING WHEN IT COMES TO

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:42.321
FOSSIL FUEL USE ON EARTH. IN

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:45.191
THE TIME FRAME OF HUMAN HISTORY

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.993
IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THAT WE ARE

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:49.061
NOT PRACTICING SUSTAINABLE

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:51.264
PRACTICES FOSSIL ENERGY YEARS

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.566
APPEARS AS A DELTA FUNCTION IN

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.868
THE COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY.

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:57.803
IT'S QUITE OBVIOUSLY NOT

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.541
SUSTAINABLE. AND HERE WHAT

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:04.577
ABOUT THOSE EXTERNALITIES.

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:05.878
ENERGY CONVERSION FOR THE MOST

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.680
PART HAS IMPROVED QUALITY OF

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.448
LIFE AND FREEDOM FREEDOM OF

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:12.919
MOBILITY. BUT IT ALSO IS

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:14.921
UNFORTUNATELY THE MOST

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:16.722
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OF

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:19.292
ENVIRONMENTAL AND I SUGGEST

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:22.628
GEOPOLITICAL PROBLEMS. THESE

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:24.597
ARE THE THINGS THAT WHEN YOU

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:25.197
LOOK AT THE ENERGY BALANCE YOU

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:28.267
DON'T SEE. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.269
MOST IMPORTANT ONE FROM MY

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.338
PERSPECTIVE IS THE FACT THAT

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.873
THE SAME ENERGY CONVERSION

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.775
TECHNOLOGIES LEAD TO CRITERIA

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:38.210
POLLUTANT EMISSIONS AND WHILE

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:40.046
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS LED

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.948
THE WORLD IN ADDRESSING

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:43.215
CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:45.885
IMPROVING AIR QUALITY WE STILL

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:48.120
HAVE SO MANY PLACES EVEN IN

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:50.790
THIS VERY WEALTHY AND- SUPER

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.391
STRICT REGIME PORT FOR

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.827
CONTROLLING. CRITERIA POLLUTANT

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:56.729
EMISSIONS WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:57.997
WITH SERIOUS HEALTH

00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.966
CONSEQUENCES WE STILL HAVE

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:01.167
PEOPLE THAT ARE DYING

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:03.936
PREMATURELY. FROM THESE

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:06.405
CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT WE ARE

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.207
DOING WITH ENERGY CONVERSION.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.608
AND THEN WE HAVE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:10.910
EMISSIONS WHICH AFFECT OUR

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:13.212
CLIMATE AND THESE INCLUDE MANY

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.181
FROM THE ENERGY CONVERSION LIKE

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:17.149
CARBON DIOXIDE METHANE AND

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:19.785
NITROUS OXIDE. AND THEN

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.253
RESOURCE RECOVERY DAMAGE LIKE

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.989
WE HAVE IN MIND OR REGIONAL

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.024
RESOURCE DEPLETION THAT LEADS

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:26.859
TO GEOPOLITICAL DEPENDENCIES

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.828
BUT THE ENERGY FUTURE MUST BE

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:31.764
MORE DIVERSE AND MORE EQUAL. TO

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:32.965
PROVIDE ACCESS TO THOSE

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:34.433
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.669
CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS. THIS IS

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:38.437
WHAT LEADS TO THOSE

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.639
GEOPOLITICAL DEPENDENCIES. AND

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.708
OF COURSE AS I SHOWED EARLIER.

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:44.043
HI MERRY ENERGY RESOURCE

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.444
DEPLETION IS SIMPLY NOT

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:50.449
SUSTAINABLE. BUT THERE'S REALLY

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:52.585
GOOD NEWS AND THE GOOD NEWS IS

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:56.122
FAIRLY RECENT BECAUSE SOLAR AND

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:57.957
WIND POWER AND BATTERY COSTS

00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:00.626
FALL DRAMATICALLY FALLEN IN THE

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:02.762
LAST DECADE THEY HAVE FALLEN SO

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:04.063
MUCH AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.067
AS A PRIMARY FORM OF ENERGY

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:10.302
THEY'RE THE CHEAPEST. SOLAR AND

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.171
WIND POWER THE CHEAPEST FORMS

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:14.006
OF PRIMARY ENERGY OUT THERE ON

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:17.343
THE MARKET TODAY. AND THIS

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.346
LEADS TO POPULAR THINKING THAT

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:24.316
WE SHOULD. MAKE ALL OF OUR

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:26.652
POWER FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:28.354
INCLUDING SOLAR AND WIND

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:31.057
GEOTHERMAL AND OTHERS. AND AS A

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:33.993
RESULT USE THAT ALECTRA POWER

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.430
GENERATION IN ALL END USES. AND

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.899
USE BATTERIES TO HANDLE THIS

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:42.334
INTERMITTENCY ON THE GRID AND

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:46.906
FOR AND HOUSTON'S. AND SOME

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:50.209
THINK THIS IS ALL WE NEED. SOME

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:52.044
ALSO MAKE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:53.379
FACT THAT WE NEED HYDROGEN AND

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:54.346
FUEL CELLS THEY SAY SOMETHING

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:55.614
LIKE THIS MOST HYDROGEN TODAY

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:56.982
IS MADE FROM FSSIL FUELS

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.452
NATURAL GAS FOR MAKING HYDROGEN

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.220
FROM WATER AND ELECTRICITY IS

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:02.521
LESS EFFICIENT THAN CHARGING A

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:03.923
BATTERY OR MAKING ELECTRICITY

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:05.458
FROM HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL IS

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:06.792
LESS EFFICIENT THAN A BATTERY

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:08.127
SO THAT. THE ROUND TRIP

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:10.296
EFFICIENCY OF THE HYDROGEN

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:12.832
ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY IS

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.967
LOWER THAN A BATTERY. AND THEY

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.502
ALSO SAY THAT HYDROGEN IS

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.204
DIFFICULT TO STORE AND MOVE

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.974
AROUND IN SOCIETY. AND VERY

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:24.877
INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE. PEOPLE THAT

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:27.847
I ADMIRE- MAKING ALL OF THESE

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:34.954
ARGUMENTS. INTERESTINGLY I

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.524
AGREE WITH MOST OF THE S.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:42.995
HOWEVER. THIS IS SADLY

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:44.630
UNTRUTHFUL AND DOESN'T TELL THE

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:47.299
WHOLE STORY. WEMUST MAKE

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:49.668
CERTAIN SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS TO

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.203
THE STATEMENTS FOR THAT FOR IT

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.771
TO TELL THE WHOLE STORY BECAUSE

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:54.707
NOT ALL AND USES CAN BE

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:58.010
ELECTRIFIED. AND BATTERIES ARE

00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:59.311
VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:00.679
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE BUT

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:02.615
THEY CAN'T HANDLE ALL OF THE

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:04.984
INTERMITTENCY UNDERGRAD. AND

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.953
THEY CAN'T BE USED FOR ALL AND

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.526
USES ONLY SOME. AND WHILE THE

00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:15.561
ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY IS LESS

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.063
IN GOING FROM ELECTRICITY TO

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.698
HYDROGEN BACK TO ELECTRICITY

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:22.001
THAN IT IS FOR A BATTERY. IT'S

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.936
ACTUALLY MORE EFFICIENT IF YOU

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:26.472
WANT LONG DURATION STORAGE. AND

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:27.940
WHILE HYDROGEN IS MORE

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:29.508
DIFFICULT TO MOVE AROUND IN

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:30.776
STORE INTO SOCIETY THIS IS ONLY

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:31.977
TRUE IF YOU COMPARE IT TO

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:34.513
FOSSIL FUELS. IT'S ACTUALLY

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.915
LIGHTER WEIGHT IN SOME CASES

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.316
MUCH EASIER TO MOVE ROUND IN

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:40.019
SOCIETY THAN BATTERIES FOR EGGS

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:43.889
FOR INSTANCE. SO WITH THESE

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.925
WHITE MODIFICATIONS YOU CAN SEE

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:49.028
THAT WE NEED NOT ONLY RENEWABLE

00:13:49.094 --> 00:13:50.796
POWER GENERATION AND BATTERIES

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.164
BUT WE NEED RENEWABLE POWER

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:54.099
GESTURE GENERATION BATTERIES

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.435
AND- HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL

00:13:56.502 --> 00:14:00.005
TECHNOLOGY. AND WE'VE DONE LOTS

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.073
OF RESEARCH OVER THE YEARS TO

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.475
SHOW WHY WE NEED THIS AND ONE

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:05.511
OF THEM IS SIMPLY THE MAGNITUDE

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:07.079
THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE THAT WILL

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:09.048
BE REQUIRED FOR A 1100%

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:11.083
RENEWABLE GRADING CALIFORNIA.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.284
THIS IS A SIMULATION THAT WE

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:13.719
DID QUITE A WHILE AGO WHERE WE

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:15.354
LOOKED AT THE FIFTEEN MINUTE BY

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:18.791
FIFTEEN MINUTE. AVAILABILITY OF

00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:22.294
SUN AND WIND RESOURCES AND THE

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.263
DEMAND ON THE ELECTRIC GRID.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.698
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.399
HAVE PLENTY OF PLACES WHERE WE

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:28.634
CAN PUT WINTER AND SUMMER

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.603
INFLUX SOLAR FARMS SO THAT WE

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:32.004
CAN MAKE ENOUGH RENEWABLE

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.239
ENERGY TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:35.374
WHOLE YEAR WE HAVE ENOUGH

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:37.876
PRIMARY ENERGY RESOURCES. BUT

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:41.480
THE DYNAMICS OF THIS MATTER. IN

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.415
OTHER WORDS THERE ARE SOME

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:45.084
FIFTEEN MINUTE PERIODS SHOWN IN

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.519
THE READ THE DATA HERE. WHERE

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:50.022
THERE IS A DATA SET OF SUN AND

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:51.523
WIND POWER COMPARED TO THE

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.560
DEMAND. THEN THERE ARE OTHER

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:55.961
FIFTEEN MINUTE PERIODS WHERE

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.163
SHOWN IN THE BLUE DATA WE HAVE

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.368
A SURPLUS OF SUN AND WIND POWER.

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:03.636
SO NOW ALL WE NEED TO DO IS

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.437
JUST STORAGE AND TO MOVE IT

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:08.140
AROUND IN SOCIETY SO HOW DO WE

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:10.542
DO THAT TODAY WE HAVE A VERY

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:12.645
LARGE PUMPED HYDRO SYSTEM IN

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:13.212
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.648
THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO OUR

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:17.483
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE. IF

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:19.918
WE WERE ABLE TO TURN ALL OF THE

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.655
PUMPS ON AT ONCE OKAY IN OUR

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.123
COMPUTER SYSTEM WE CAN CONSUME

00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:25.791
ABOUT NINE GIGAWATTS OF

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:27.726
ELECTRICITY THAT'S THE HEIGHT.

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:30.729
OF THIS BOX HERE. AND IF WE HAD

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.264
ALL OF THE UPPER LAKE'S FULL

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.366
AND WE CAN PUT ALL OF THAT-

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:35.701
HYDRODYNAMIC ENERGY THROUGH

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.736
TURBINES TO MAKE ELECTRICITY WE

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:39.038
CAN ACTUALLY RETURN TO THE

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:41.840
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT SAME

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.876
NINE GIGAWATTS FOR ALMOST A

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:46.545
MONTH. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.881
BOX OF THIS SIZE SO THIS IS A

00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:51.884
VERY LARGE POWER AND ENERGY

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.488
CAPABLE. PUMPED HYDRO SYSTEM.

00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:58.257
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S NOT

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:00.426
ENOUGH TO ABSORB ALL OF THE

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:02.361
SERVICES. AND TO MOVE THEM ALL

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:03.929
TO THE DEFICITS SOME PEOPLE SAY

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:05.998
WELL LET'S JUST USE OUR BATTERY

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.500
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND USE THOSE

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:09.902
TO MOVE THIS ENERGY AROUND AND

00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:12.037
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA WE CAN MOVE

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:14.640
SOME OF IT AROUND- HOW BIG DO

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:17.776
YOU THINK THAT'LL BE THE L. IF

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:19.678
WE CONVERTED UP ALL TWENTY ONE

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:20.979
MILLION OF OUR LIGHT AND MEDIUM

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:23.482
DUTY VEHICLES. TO BATTERY

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:26.151
ELECTRIC VEHICLES WITH A SIXTY

00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:26.985
TWO KILOWATT HOUR BATTERY

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:28.454
THAT'S THE NISSAN LEAF

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.522
EQUIVALENT BATTERY. THIS IS A

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:33.892
LARGE EIGHT POWER. DEMAND TO

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:36.562
GET COULD ABSORB. WHICH IS VERY

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:40.199
LARGE ORDER THIRTY GIGAWATTS.

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.701
ONLY STORES ENOUGH ENERGY FR

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:47.072
ABOUT FOUR HOURS. SO THIS ALSO

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.574
MAY HELP WITH THE SHORT

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.043
DURATION DYNAMICS BUT REALLY

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.413
CAN'T MOVE ALL OF THIS ENERGY

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.316
THAT'S ACCESS IN THE SUMMER TO

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:58.884
THE FALL AND WINTER AS IT'S

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:02.955
NEEDED. ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:05.591
SIMPLY CONVERTED EXISTING GAS

00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:07.526
STORAGE FACILITIES TO HYDROGEN.

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:09.461
THIS IS A LARGE THAT RESOURCE

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:12.698
WOULD BE. IT'S THE ONLY

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.267
RESOURCE THAT IS OF THE

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:18.837
MAGNITUDE. THAT THE 1100%

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:21.073
RENEWABLE GRID REQUIRES IT'S

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.141
THE ONLY RESOURCE THAT COULD

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.643
POSSIBLY TAKE ALL OF THE ACCESS

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.179
IN ONE SEASON AND DELIVER IT TO

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.882
THE OTHER SEASONS SO THAT WE

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:33.419
CAN MAKE OUR CALIFORNIA GRANT.

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:37.890
101% RENEWABLE. BATTERIES ARE

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:39.458
VERY IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:41.994
SUPPORTED BUT THEY WILL NEVER

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.628
BE BIG ENOUGH TO GO ALL THE WAY

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:45.297
TO A 100% HYDROGEN ON THE OTHER

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:49.701
HAND IS. WE DID THIS ANALYSIS

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:52.571
ALSO FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.673
LOOKING AT THE DYNAMICS OF SUN

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.909
AND WIND IN VARIOUS CONTINENTS

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:59.445
OKAY AND VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF SUN

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:01.447
AND WIND IN THESE CONTINENTS

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:04.049
AND STUDYING THE HOUR BY HOUR

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:06.218
AVAILABILITY OF THOSE RESOURCES

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:07.786
AND COUPLE THAT TO THE DEMAND

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:12.257
DYNAMICS AND WE- ASSESS THE BAN

00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:14.793
FOR ONE FOR A WORLD TO BECOME

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.361
1100% RENEWABLE WE NEEDED MORE

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:19.364
THAN TWENTY THOUSAND TERAWATT

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:20.966
HOURS OF ENERGY STORAGE. THE

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:22.100
VERY BEST BATTERIES IN THE

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:22.968
WORLD TODAY ARE MADE WITH

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:24.570
LITHIUM AND COBALT THESE ARE

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:26.505
WITH THE- ION BATTERIES THIS

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:27.873
WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN THREE

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.308
THOUSAND MEGATONS OF LITHIUM

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:31.210
AND MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:31.844
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED MEGATONS

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.479
OF COBALT. TO MAKE THE VERY

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:37.316
FIRST OKAY BATTERY USING THE

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:38.851
BEST BATTERY TECHNOLOGY IN THE

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:40.752
WORLD THE BILL THAT ONE BATTERY

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:43.088
US TWENTY THOUSAND TERAWATT

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:45.257
HOURS. UNFORTUNATELY ON EARTH

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:46.458
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESOURCES

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:47.326
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE THERE'S

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:48.794
ONLY FIFTY THREE MEGATONS OF

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.329
LITHIUM AND ONLY TWENTY FIVE

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.898
MEGATONS ON EARTH- ON

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.766
TERRESTRIAL. LOCATIONS ON EARTH

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:56.535
AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:57.636
MEGATONS ON THE OCEAN FLOOR IF

00:18:57.703 --> 00:18:58.737
WE DECIDED TO MIND THAT BUT

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:01.406
WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.675
THE WORLD'S VERY BEST BATTERIES.

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:05.143
ARE MADE WITH THESE RESOURCES

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.146
THAT ARE TOTALLY INSUFFICIENT.

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:10.949
TO BE USED FOR GRAND SCALE

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:14.152
STORAGE. IN ADDITION MORE THAN

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.821
60% OF THE COBALT COMES FROM

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:16.755
THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:17.623
CONGO THAT DOESN'T HAVE

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:19.992
SUSTAINABLE NON BUSINESS

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:23.762
PRACTICES OR CHILD LABOR LAWS.

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.364
I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD USE

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.665
BATTERIES WHERE THEY MAKE THE

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:27.833
MOST SENSE IN LIGHT DUTY

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.202
VEHICLES AND IN CELLULAR PHONES

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:32.204
AND PERSONAL ELECTRONICS THERE

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:33.639
IS WHERE WE NEED THEM FOR A

00:19:33.705 --> 00:19:35.107
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE.

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:36.742
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH LITHIUM OR

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.143
COBALT IN THE WORLD TO USE IT

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.012
FOR THESE MASSIVE STORAGE

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:42.848
REQUIREMENTS OF A TOTALLY

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:47.786
RENEWABLE GRID. SH ADDITION

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.621
BATTERIES ARE SUPER EFFICIENT

00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:51.723
IF YOU SH STORE ENERGY FOR A

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.392
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THIS IS

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:55.494
DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA'S SELF

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.129
GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM

00:19:57.195 --> 00:19:58.130
ADVANCED ENERGY STORAGE

00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:01.466
PROJECTS- AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE.

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:04.169
IS THE ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:06.038
THAT'S WHAT'S PLOTTED HERE

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:07.873
VERSUS THE CAPACITY FACTOR AND

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.808
CAPACITY FACTORS ESSENTIALLY

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.277
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TIME.

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:13.312
BETWEEN THE CHARGING AND

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.480
DISCHARGING OKAY SO IF YOU HAVE

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:16.915
A HIGH CAPACITY FACTOR THAT

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:19.151
MEANS YOU'RE CHARGED. LET'S SAY

00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:20.052
ONE DAY AND THE VERY NEXT

00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:21.853
EVENING YOU JUST CHARGE.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.255
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IF YOU

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:24.890
HAVE A LOW CAPACITY FACTOR THAT

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:26.191
MEANS YOU CHARGE ONE DAY YOU

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.225
STARTED FOR A WEEK AND THEN YOU

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:29.728
JUST TARGET FOR EVEN LONGER

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:31.363
THAN THAT. WHAT YOU CAN SEE

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.231
HERE S THAT THE AVERAGE OF

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:35.667
THESE GRANTS SIZED UTILITY

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:37.769
APPLICATIONS OF BATTERY SYSTEMS

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:39.771
IS THE AVERAGE ROUNDTRIP

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:42.007
EFFICIENCY IS AROUND 60% AND

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:44.576
THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO SELF

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.511
DISCHARGE SOMETHING WE ARE

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.013
FAMILIAR WITH FROM THE

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.748
BATTERIES WE USE IN OUR CELL

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:52.050
PHONES OR IN OUR CARS WE KNOW

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:53.285
THAT IF WE DON'T USE IT FOR

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:56.421
QUITE AWHILE IT DISCHARGES. AND

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:58.724
THIS IS BECAUSE THE STORAGE

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.360
MEDIUM IS AN INTIMATE CONTACT

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.528
WITH THE ELECTRODES AND THERE'S

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:07.265
NO WAY OF. EVENTING COMPLETELY

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:10.302
PSALM DISCHARGE. AND THIS IS

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:12.304
WHY WHEN IT COMES TO LONG

00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:15.273
DURATION STORAGE BATTERIES ARE

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.975
NOT WELL SUITED TO THIS

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:19.177
HYDROGEN IS BETTER SUITED TO

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:22.247
THE MASSIVE AND LONG DURATION

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:24.349
STORAGE THAT WE NEED AT THAT

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:29.221
UTILITY SCALE. AND THE DYNAMICS

00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:30.589
WORK VERY WELL FOR HYDROGEN

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.357
THIS IS RESEARCH THAT WE DID

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:33.825
QUITE A WHILE AGO LOOKING AT

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:35.961
TEXAS WIND YOU CAN SEE THE WIND

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:38.997
DYNAMICS THAT ARE SHOWN HERE

00:21:39.064 --> 00:21:43.101
WHEN I TRY TO GET A POINTER.

00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:46.505
GOING YOU CAN SEE THE WIND

00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:48.840
DYNAMICS AND GREEN HERE AND YOU

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:50.709
CAN SEE THE DEMAND DYNAMICS OF

00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:53.578
AN ADJACENT TOWN IN MAGENTA AND

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.546
THEN YOU CAN SEE WHENEVER THERE

00:21:54.613 --> 00:21:56.314
IS ACCESS WIND WE CAN PUT IT

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.083
THROUGH AN ELECTROLYZER AND

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.285
MAKE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN FROM

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:01.620
THAT ACCESS GRANTED WHENEVER

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:03.188
THERE'S A DEFICIT OF WHEN WE

00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:04.990
ACTUALLY TAKE THE HYDROGEN OUT

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:05.557
OF THE SALT CAVERN THAT WE

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:07.526
STARTED IN AND PUT IT THROUGH A

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:08.593
FUEL CELL SO THAT WE CAN

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.495
ACTUALLY MEET THE DEMAND OF

00:22:10.562 --> 00:22:13.131
THIS ADJACENT CITY- AT EVERY

00:22:13.198 --> 00:22:16.134
HOUR OF THE YEAR THIS IS JUST

00:22:16.201 --> 00:22:18.136
SHOWING ONE WEEK IN OCTOBER. WE

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:19.304
FOUND THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:20.405
MANAGE THE PRESSURE AND

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:21.506
TEMPERATURE DYNAMICS IN THE

00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:23.175
SALT CAVERN WHERE RESTORING ALL

00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:25.577
THE HYDROGEN TO. BELOW MAXIMUM

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:28.847
AN ABOVE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.

00:22:28.914 --> 00:22:29.781
IF YOU LOOK AT IT FOR THE WHOLE

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.149
YEAR SHOWN HERE ON THE RIGHT

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.984
HAND SIDE YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:35.520
BY OUR MINUTE BY MINUTE. AND

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:38.924
EVEN MONTH BY MONTH WE ARE ABLE

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.127
TO STORE WINDPOWER AND COUPLE

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:45.063
IT COMPLETELY TO THE ENERGY

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.233
DEMAND IN THIS CITY IN TEXAS

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.302
YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT ACCESS

00:22:50.368 --> 00:22:53.972
OVERALL. WIN POWER IN OCTOBER

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:55.440
NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:57.409
FEBRUARY MARCH. IS ACTUALLY

00:22:57.476 --> 00:22:59.945
RETURNED PRIMARILY IN JULY

00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:02.447
AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER TO THAT

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:03.982
COMMUNITY. SO YOU CAN SEE WE

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.350
CAN DO THE HOUR BY HOUR AND

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:09.354
SEASONAL. COMPLEMENTING OF WIND

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:11.857
POWER TO THE DEMAND SO WHAT WE

00:23:11.923 --> 00:23:15.127
DON'T HAVE A SALT CAVERN. WELL

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:16.661
I SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:18.296
UNDERGROUND STORAGE

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:19.731
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:21.733
SYSTEM TODAY THAT CAN BE

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.238
CONVERTED WITH SOME INVESTMENT

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:29.541
TO- STORE AND DISTRIBUTE THIS

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:30.942
VALUABLE RESOURCE AS A MATTER

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:32.711
OF FACT RECENT STUDIES BY THE

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.546
GAS TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:36.882
SUGGESTS THAT THE RELIABILITY

00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:37.816
OF THIS UNDERGROUND

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:40.318
INFRASTRUCTURE IS MORE THAN

00:23:40.385 --> 00:23:40.852
FIVE NINES THROUGHOUT THE

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:44.956
NATION. SO HYDROGEN IS GOING TO

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:47.392
BE IMPORTANT FOR RESILIENCY.

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:50.362
FOR MASSIVE STORAGE AND FOR

00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:52.030
TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:53.598
ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:54.733
CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ALREADY

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.702
HAVE CHALLENGES WITH MOVING ALL

00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:01.072
OF OUR ENERGY THROUGH- FROM THE

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:05.277
DESERT AND- BORDER AREAS INTO

00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:07.646
URBAN AREAS WE HAVE CHALLENGES

00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:09.181
WITH WILDFIRES GET CHALLENGES

00:24:09.247 --> 00:24:11.183
WITH S. P. S. P. S. EVENTS THAT

00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:13.885
CAN BE HELPED BY AN INVESTMENT

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:15.821
IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR

00:24:15.887 --> 00:24:18.957
GAS SYSTEM. AND IT IS A MASSIVE

00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:22.427
RESOURCE AS A MATTER OF FACT.

00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:23.662
THIRTEEN TERAWATT HOURS OF

00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:25.664
EQUIVALENT ELECTRICITY STORAGE

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.766
CAN BE ACCOMMODATED JUST IN

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:29.201
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SERVICE

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:31.136
TERRITORY THIS IS WORTH TWO

00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:32.838
POINT SIX TRILLION DOLLARS AT

00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:35.273
FUTURE BATTERY COST. EVEN IF WE

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.175
JUST IJECTED 5% HIGHER CHEN

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:39.244
INTO THE NATURAL GAS THIS IS AN

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.812
EQUIVALENT STORAGE SYSTEM THAT

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:42.247
WOULD BE WORTH ONE HUNDRED AND

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.616
THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:24:44.683 --> 00:24:46.918
DEALING FUTURE BATTERY COSTS.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:49.454
THIS IS SUCH A LARGE STORAGE

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:50.789
AND TRANSMISSION AND

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.891
DISTRIBUTION RESOURCE. THAT

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:55.427
EVEN JUST 5% OF IT. IS THIS

00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:57.195
VALUABLE HOW THESE NUMBERS ARE

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:58.430
SO BIG IN MY MIND I HAVE A HARD

00:24:58.496 --> 00:25:00.765
TIME BECAUSE- MATCHING WHAT HOW

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:02.400
BIG THEY ARE SO I COMPARED IT

00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:03.335
TO SOMETHING I KNOW MORE ABOUT

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:05.470
LIKE. THE TUITION AND FEES AT

00:25:05.537 --> 00:25:06.972
UC IRVINE AND WE COULD SEND THE

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:08.740
ENTIRE ORANGE COUNTY POPULATION

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:09.674
MORE THAN TWO POINT TWO MILLION

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:11.776
PEOPLE. TO FOUR YEARS OF THE

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:12.844
ENTIRE POPULATION IT WOULD ONLY

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:13.945
COST THIRTY NINE BILLION

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.647
DOLLARS OR WE CAN MAKE ALL

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:16.648
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:18.516
SCHOOLS FREE TO EVERYONE AND

00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:20.452
EVERY FOUR YEARS WE ONLY HAVE

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:21.052
TO COME UP WITH A FOUR POINT

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:23.154
SEVEN BILLION. SOME SOMETHING

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:25.523
ABOUT THIS. TRANSFORMING THE

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.459
GAS SYSTEM TO JUST ACCEPT 5%

00:25:27.525 --> 00:25:33.999
HYDROGEN. OKAY WOULD BE WORSE A

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:34.532
HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION

00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:37.836
DOLLARS. THE INTERESTING OF

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:40.105
WHICH WOULD EASILY PAY FOR ALL

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:45.343
OF THIS. IT'S EXTREMELY

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.281
VALUABLE TO OUR RESILIENT AND

00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:52.484
ZERO EMISSIONS FUTURE. AND FUEL

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.586
CELL SYSTEMS OPERATING OFF OF

00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.454
GAS DELIVERED AN UNDERGROUND

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:58.423
GAS UNDERGROUND GAS SYSTEM HAVE

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.225
PROVEN THIS RESILIENCE THROUGH

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:02.661
ALL SORTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.496
LIKE THE SAN DIEGO BLACKOUT

00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:06.865
THAT OCCURRED IN TWENTY ELEVEN

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.667
WINTER STORMS IN THE NORTHEAST

00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:10.168
EARTHQUAKES LIKE THE NAPA

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:11.102
EARTHQUAKE IN CALIFORNIA

00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:13.038
RECENTLY. OR THE RIDGECREST

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:14.439
EARTHQUAKE EVEN MORE RECENTLY

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:15.941
THE MANHATTAN BLACKED OUT

00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:17.909
JAPANESE SUPER TYPHOONS

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:19.911
HUNDREDS OF EXAMPLES OF THIS

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:23.548
BEING PROVEN BY THE GAS SYSTEM

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:26.484
AND FUEL CELLS. WE ALSO NEED

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:27.852
HYDROGEN FOR OTHER THINGS AND I

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.721
WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO WORK WITH

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:31.089
SOME AWESOME SCIENTISTS AND

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:33.058
ENGINEERS LED BY MY COLLEAGUE

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:35.126
STEVE DAVIS HERE AND WE

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:37.095
FORTUNATELY WE WERE LOOKING AT

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:39.364
HOW DO WE MAKE THE ENTIRETY OF

00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:41.066
OUR ENERGY SYSTEM ZERO

00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:43.668
EMISSIONS. AND HYDROGEN PLAYS A

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:45.837
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANY OF

00:26:45.904 --> 00:26:47.238
THESE THINGS OF COURSE WE NEED

00:26:47.305 --> 00:26:49.374
PRIMARY SUN AND WIND ENERGY BUT

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.676
WE ALSO NEED THINGS THAT DEPEND

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:53.178
UPON HYDROGEN LIKE THE

00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:55.880
PRODUCTION OF AMMONIA. OR THE

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.182
PRODUCTION OF AVIATION OR

00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:59.584
TRANSPORTATION LIQUID FUELS

00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:01.553
ABOUT CEMENT AND STEEL OR HOW

00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:02.854
ABOUT MAKING HOSPITALS AS

00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:04.456
RESILIENT AS POSSIBLE THESE

00:27:04.522 --> 00:27:05.991
KINDS OF THINGS NEED THE

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:08.326
FEATURES. THAT HYDROGEN

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:11.563
PROVIDES OF COURSE IN ADDITION

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:13.765
TO INVESTMENTS IN SOLAR WIND

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:16.401
BATTERIES ETCETERA. AND IN

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:17.369
PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:20.739
FUELS THERE ARE VERY DIFFICULT

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:23.241
TO ELECTRIFY AND USES. SOME OF

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:25.210
OUR SHOWN HERE LIKE FUEL CELL

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.445
BUSES OR SHIPS OR AIRCRAFT OR

00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:29.881
LONG HAUL TRUCKS OR TRAINS.

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:31.216
LITERALLY ANYTHING THAT WOULD

00:27:31.282 --> 00:27:33.952
REQUIRE RAPID FUELING OR LONG

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:37.022
RANGE OR LARGE PAYLOAD IN THE

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:39.290
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TENDS TO

00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:41.659
PREFER ZERO EMISSIONS WITH

00:27:41.726 --> 00:27:44.429
HYDROGEN. TWO ZERO EMISSIONS

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:47.332
WITH BATTERIES YEAH BOTH OF

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:48.533
THESE ARE IMPORTANT BUT IF YOU

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.037
NEED THESE FEATURES HYDROGEN

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:52.570
WILL BE PREFERRED FOR ZERO

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:54.539
EMISSIONS. THERE ARE MANY

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:57.409
INDUSTRIAL END USES LIKE STEEL

00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:59.677
CEMENT PLASTICS PHARMACEUTICALS

00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:02.180
CHIP. COMPUTER CHIP FABRICATION

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:03.114
OR A MILLION FERTILIZER

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:05.417
PRODUCTION AND MANY OTHERS THAT

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:06.518
CANNOT BE ELECTRIFIED BECAUSE

00:28:06.584 --> 00:28:08.887
OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEAT OR

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:11.790
FEEDSTOCK OR REDUCING GAS THIS

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.925
CAN BE DELIVERED ON THE OTHER

00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:16.861
HAND BY HYDROGEN. AND THEN WE

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:19.864
COME TO THE COLORS OF HYDROGEN.

00:28:19.931 --> 00:28:21.299
WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE'S NO

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:24.302
ACCEPTED OR AGREED TO STANDARD

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:26.538
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. I'VE PUT

00:28:26.604 --> 00:28:28.640
TOGETHER AN EXAMPLE HERE OF.

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:30.775
MANY COLORS OF HYDROGEN THAT

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:32.877
PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING AND WHILE

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:35.046
THIS MIGHT MAKE FOR A COLORFUL

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:37.615
RAINBOW. I SUGGEST THAT PICKING

00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:40.118
WINNERS AND LOSERS INHIBITS

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:42.520
WHAT WE DESIRE. IMAGE THE

00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:44.789
MARKET INVESTMENT AND OFTEN IT

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:47.559
LEADS TO UNEXPECTED NEGATIVE

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:50.695
CONSEQUENCES. OFTEN INCREASING

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:53.031
EMISSIONS RATHER THAN

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:56.568
DECREASING THEM AS WE DESIRE.

00:28:56.634 --> 00:28:58.570
SO I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT WE

00:28:58.636 --> 00:29:02.640
DO NOT ESTABLISH THIS SORT OF A

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:06.411
COLOR PREFERENCE BUT RATHER USE

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:09.247
ALREADY ESTABLISHED MEANS OF

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:10.748
ASSESSING CARBON UNTESTED

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:12.784
INTENSITY OR ASSESSING THE

00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:15.787
EMISSIONS IMPACTS THIS IS THE

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:17.922
METRIC THAT WE SHOULD USE FOR

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:19.290
ASSESSING WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE

00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:21.559
DOING SOMETHING DESIRABLE BY

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:27.132
ADOPTING HYDROGEN. ONE AND WITH

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:30.168
TWO THINGS THAT WE THAT THAT WE

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:32.370
HAVE ANALYZED IN SOME DEGREE OF

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.506
DETAIL HERE ONE OF THEM IS CAN

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:36.174
WE MAKE THE PORT OF LA LONG

00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:38.109
BEACH COMPLETELY ZERO

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:40.278
EMISSIONS. AND WE LOOKED AT

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:41.079
BATTERY SAYS ONE OF THE

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:42.547
SOLUTION AND HYDROGEN IS ONE OF

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:43.948
THE SOLUTIONS FOR THE SHIPS FOR

00:29:44.015 --> 00:29:45.650
EXAMPLE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:46.985
IS THE PERCENT OF ORIGINAL

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:48.953
CARGO SPACE AND THAT TONNAGE

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.156
THAT A HYDROGEN OPTION AND A

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:53.091
BATTERY OPTION COULD ENGENDER

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:55.393
AND IT'S VERY APPLAUDED VERSES

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.229
THE SHIP'S SIZE IN THOUSANDS OF

00:29:58.296 --> 00:29:59.697
TWENTY FOOT EQUIVALENT UNITS

00:29:59.764 --> 00:30:01.733
OKAY SO YOU CAN SEE THIS IS ONE

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.334
THOUSAND TWO YEAR AND ASSIST

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.169
THIRTEEN THOUSAND TWO YEAR. AND

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:05.170
WHEN YOU CAN SEE ALMOST

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:06.804
IMMEDIATELY IS THAT THE BATTERY

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:09.607
CASES ARE SEVERELY DIMINISHED

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:10.775
AND FOR THE MOST PART HAVE

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:13.144
HARDLY ANY TONNAGE THAT'S LEFT

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.913
ONCE YOU OUTFIT THEM WITH

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:17.749
BATTERIES IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:19.784
MAKE SHIPS ZERO EMISSION WITH

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.753
BATTERIES ON THE OTHER HAND

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:23.354
BOTH HYDROGEN GASTRIN IN THE

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:25.523
GREEN DATA AND HYDROGEN LIQUID

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.825
SHOWN IN THE READ DATA. HAVE

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:29.394
SUFFICIENT VOLUME IN TONNAGE TO

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.162
MAKE IT FEASIBLE AS A MATTER OF

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:32.130
FACT IN PARTICULAR IN THE

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:34.966
LIQUID HYDROGEN CASES 1100% OF

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:37.135
THE ORIGINAL CUT TO CARGO SPACE

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:40.104
AND TONNAGE IS ALMOST EXACTLY

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:45.843
ATTAINABLE WITH A HYDROGEN.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.545
SHIP OPTION. AND THEN YOU CAN

00:30:47.612 --> 00:30:49.147
TAKE THOSE SHIPS OVER GREAT

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.616
DISTANCES THIS IS LIKE

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:52.183
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND NAUTICAL

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.651
MILES AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THE

00:30:53.718 --> 00:30:55.687
CARGO THAT IS ABLE TO BE TAKEN

00:30:55.753 --> 00:30:58.823
BY HYDROGEN CHIPS. CAN YOU GO

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.092
CAN CAN GO A LONG WAYS AND CAN

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.094
STILL BE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE THE

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:05.263
SAME AMOUNT OF CARGO THAT WERE

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.632
CUT CARRYING TODAY. AND IF WE

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.267
DID THIS AND WE TOOK ALL THE

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:10.668
SHIPS ALL THE TRAINS ALL THE

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:16.007
TRUCKS. EIGHT POINT NINE

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:17.108
MILLION TONS OF HYDROGEN TO BE

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:18.977
GENERATED EVERY YEAR SO CAN WE

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:20.044
MAKE THAT MUCH TIGHTER JOHN.

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:21.913
ISNER FACT WE'VE ANALYZED JUST

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.882
OFFSHORE WIND AND JUST THREE

00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:26.084
OFFSHORE WIND FARMS IN THESE

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.986
LOCATIONS AND THE COST OF THIS

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.487
OFFSHORE WIND IS COMING DOWN

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:32.890
VERY SUBSTANTIALLY COULD MAKE.

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:35.827
ALL OF THAT HYDROGEN EVERY YEAR.

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:38.763
THIS IS A VISION FOR THE FUTURE

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.599
THAT CANNOT BE ENGENDERED.

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:45.803
WITHOUT HYDROGEN. WINDPOWER IN

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.505
THREE LARGE WIND FARMS CAN MAKE

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:49.307
THE ENTIRETY OF THE L. A. LONG

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:54.612
BEACH COURT ZERO EMISSIONS.

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:55.913
WE'VE ALSO BEEN LOOKING A LOT

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.982
OF DATA CENTERS RECENTLY AND-

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:59.751
HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF DATA

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:01.386
CENTERS THAT WE ANALYZED TO

00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:02.854
PRODUCE ALL OF THE PRIMARY

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.789
ENERGY FROM SUN AND WIND AND TO

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:08.092
USE BATTERIES OR POWER TO GAS-

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:10.328
IN VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS TO

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.463
MEET THE DEMAND DYNAMICS IN

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.432
VARIOUS LOCATIONS TWO. AND

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:15.400
THESE ARE THE MODELING

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:16.301
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE MADE AND

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:17.969
YOU CAN SEE HERE WE DO INDEED

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:19.070
HAVE LOWER ROUND TRIP

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:21.472
EFFICIENCY FOR THE HYDROGEN

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:22.840
CASES THAN WE DO FOR THE

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:25.143
BATTERY CASES. AND WE HAVE TO

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:27.111
ACCOUNT FOR LIQUEFACTION WHEN

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:28.579
WE MAKE HYDROGEN AT SUCH A

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.682
LARGE SCALE THE SCALE THAT DATA

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:32.150
CENTERS REQUIRE AND SO IT TAKES

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:33.851
A LOT OF ENERGY AND IT ALSO HAS

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:36.387
SOME BOIL OFF LOSSES WHICH WE

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:37.822
ACCOUNT FOR. BUT IF AND WE CAN

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:39.757
ALSO OPTIMIZE THESE SO FOR

00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:41.092
EXAMPLE WE CAN OPTIMIZE IT FOR

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:42.527
IT FOR THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:44.395
ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND WHEN IT

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:45.196
GOES TO THE DATA CENTER

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:47.832
DIRECTLY. REACHING 81% THAT

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:49.734
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT IT IS. BUT WE

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:50.902
STILL NEED QUITE A BIT OF

00:32:50.968 --> 00:32:52.136
STORAGE IS NOT EFFECTIVE WE

00:32:52.203 --> 00:32:54.272
INSTALL MORE SOLAR AND WIND

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:55.573
POWER THEN WE HAVE A SMALLER

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.141
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM WE CAN

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:59.043
OPTIMIZE FOR THAT TOO. BUT WE

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.178
WANT TO OPTIMIZE FOR THE LOWEST

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:02.180
CAPACITY INSTALLED WE HAVE TO

00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:04.816
PICK MOSTLY MEN OUR- SO ALL OF

00:33:04.882 --> 00:33:06.718
THESE WE'VE ANALYZED. AND IN

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:07.952
EVERY SINGLE CASE WHERE WE'RE

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:09.420
LOOKING AT THESE WERE LOOKING

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:11.022
AT THE LEVELIZED COST OF

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:13.157
ELECTRICITY DELIVERED TO THE

00:33:13.224 --> 00:33:14.992
DATA CENTER. REMEMBER THIS IS

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:16.594
FOR A 100% RENEWABLE ACCOUNTING

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:18.162
FOR ALL OF THE STORAGE ALL OF

00:33:18.229 --> 00:33:19.797
THE LOSSES. FOR GETTING THROUGH

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:23.201
THE ENTIRETY OF A YEAR- AND

00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:25.303
DELIVERING THIS- ELECTRICITY TO

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.404
THE DATA CENTER AND WE CAN SEE

00:33:26.471 --> 00:33:27.805
WE HAVE TO INSTALL A LOT MORE

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:30.074
WIND AND- SOLAR P. V. IN THE

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:33.544
HYDROGEN CASE BECAUSE OF THAT

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:34.679
LOWER ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY.

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:37.849
BUT BECAUSE OF SEPARATE POWER

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.251
AND ENERGY SCALING FEATURES.

00:33:40.318 --> 00:33:50.962
AND BECAUSE OF. THE HUGE

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:51.529
MAGNITUDE OF STORAGE THAT'S

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:52.730
REQUIRED FOR THE C. HYDROGEN

00:33:52.797 --> 00:33:53.331
CASES ARE ALWAYS. VERY MUCH

THE BATTER CASE EVERYTHING CASE

00:33:58.736 --> 00:34:00.204
THAT WE LOOKED AT 4100%

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:02.874
RENEWABLE WITH ALL THE STORAGE.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.476

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.527
THERE'S NO ALTERNATE CONFUSE.

00:55:30.593 --> 00:55:31.461
IF THE VEHICLE HAPPENS TO BE

00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:33.329
LOW ON FUEL IT HAS TO SIT AT

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.865
THE STATION UNTIL IT OPENS.

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:36.466
BECAUSE THE NEAREST ONE COULD

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:38.802
BE MILES AWAY. SO OUR FLEET

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:40.503
TEAM INTERNALLY HAS PROTOCOLS

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:41.604
TO CHECK THE FUEL STATUS OUT

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:42.572
WHICH IS AN APP THAT YOU CAN

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:44.174
DOWNLOAD ON YOUR PHONE. THAT

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.341
GIVES YOU THE STATION STATUS

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:47.677
PRIOR TO FUELING. AND TODAY WE

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:48.978
ALSO HAVE A PROTOCOL TO

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:50.447
IDENTIFY A BACKUP FUELING

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:51.514
STATION JUST IN CASE THE FIRST

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:54.284
ONE HAPPENED TO BE DOWN. OR OUT

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:55.985
OF FUEL BY THE TIME WE ARRIVED.

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.620
I CAN SHARE THAT PERSONALLY

00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:58.288
I'VE SEEN MANY HUNDREDS OF

00:55:58.354 --> 00:55:59.389
VEHICLES STRANDED AT FILLING

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:01.991
STATIONS WAITING FOR THEM TOREPLENISH YOU'LL OR DISPENSER

00:56:02.058 --> 00:56:04.561
PROBLEM. THE RED CROSS FLEET

00:56:04.627 --> 00:56:05.595
TEAM HAS HAD TO USE GAS

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:07.163
VEHICLES IN THE FLEET WHILE THE

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.031
HYDROGEN ONE'S WAIT WAIT

00:56:08.098 --> 00:56:09.933
FEELING. WHICH IS NOT IDEAL FOR

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:11.901
DISASTER RESPONSE- THE VEHICLES

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:13.937
HAVE TO BE READY TO GO AT A

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:16.172
MOMENT'S NOTICE. SO TO SUM UP.

00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:18.241
THE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:18.842
BRINGING BENEFITS TO THE RED

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:20.910
CROSS MISSION. TO SUSTAIN THESE

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:22.011
VEHICLES AND THEIR BENEFITS IN

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:23.346
THE LONG TERM WE WOULD URGE THE

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:25.148
STATE TO EMBARK MORE FEELING

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.217
STATIONS. AND HAVE MORE

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:28.451
CONSISTENT FUEL REPLENISHMENT.

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:30.120
IF THE HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:31.354
WERE SET UP WITH IT AND MORE

00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:32.622
LOCATIONS AND WE'RE JUST A BIT

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.524
MORE RELIABLE. WITH FEELING I

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:35.992
WOULD NOT HESITATE TO RECOMMEND

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:38.728
MORE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:39.262
VEHICLES FOR THE RED CROSS

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.030
FLEET. SO CLOSING I JUST WANT

00:56:41.097 --> 00:56:42.465

CALIFORNIA CITY. SO WE'RE

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:08.284
CONTRAST IN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:09.586
WE'RE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:11.554

OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:20.897
VEHICLES THROUGH THE FIRST HALF

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.432
OF THE YEAR. AND WE THINK A LOT

00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:23.867
OF THAT SUCCESS IS DUE TO OUR

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.335
GROWING ELECTRIFIED LINEUP WE

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:27.237
HAVE TWELVE MODELS TODAY. AND

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:28.938

BELIEVE- AND HISTORY OF

00:58:39.649 --> 00:58:40.683
DEVELOPING A RANGE OF

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.785
ELECTRIFIED SOLUTIONS. TO MEET

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.287
CUSTOMER NEEDS IN OTHER WORDS

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:47.290
MORE THAN ONE TECHNOLOGY WITH

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:49.525
HYBRIDS. BATTERY ELECTRICS AND

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:51.127
OF COURSE FUEL CELLS AND AS YOU

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:53.129
CAN SEE FROM THE IMAGES. THESE

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.498
ARE ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS NOT

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:55.999
JUST LIGHT DUTY NOT JUST

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:58.468
PASSENGER CARS. CARS SUVS

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.036
TRUCKS BUSES HEAVY DUTY

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:01.471
COMMERCIAL. SO REALLY WE

00:59:01.537 --> 00:59:03.072
BELIEVE IN CUSTOMER CHOICE AND

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:06.075
A WIDE. VARIETY OF ELECTRIFIED

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:09.145
SOLUTIONS AND WE THINK THAT'S

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:09.712
THE RIGHT PATH TOWARDS ZERO

00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:12.782
EMISSIONS. BUT OF COURSE WE

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:14.083
REALLY VALUE HYDROGEN AND FUEL

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:16.119
CELL AND ITS POTENTIAL AND THE

00:59:16.185 --> 00:59:17.487
QUESTION IS WHY WHY ARE WE SO

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:19.289
BULLISH ON HYDROGEN. WELL AS I

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:20.590
MENTIONED TECHNOLOGICAL

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:22.091
DIVERSITY IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:23.026
US SENATE SOME OF THE

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:24.894
PRESENTERS OF START EARLIER-

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:26.829
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO RELY ON

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:28.097
ONE SINGLE TECHNOLOGY AS WE

00:59:28.164 --> 00:59:29.232
PURSUE A ZERO EMISSION

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:31.267
PORTFOLIO. AND WE THINK FUEL

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:33.903
CELLS CAN REALLY HELP DIVERSIFY

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:35.772
OUR PORTFOLIO. CUSTOMER CHOICE

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:37.473
OBVIOUSLY IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.076
TO US AND- THE BENEFIT OF- IN

00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:41.311
THE LIGHT DUTY SECTOR OF THE

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:42.912
HYDROGEN IS THE SIMILAR

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:45.782
FEELING. EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE

00:59:45.848 --> 00:59:48.051
ARE USED TO WITH GAS VEHICLES

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:49.419
OF COURSE WITHOUT THE EMISSIONS

00:59:49.485 --> 00:59:50.553
AND YOU SEE THE IMAGE ON THE

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.956
TOP OF. OF OUR NEXT SO. I

00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:56.092
DON'T- HUNDRED SHIELD STATION.

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:57.660
AND THEN THE- THE PROMISE OF

MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.064
APPLICATIONS FOR FUEL CELLS AND

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.266
HYDROGEN. AND WE REALLY BELIEVE

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.467
HYDROGEN IS A GREAT SOLUTION

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.803
BEYOND PASSENGER CARS FOR HEAVY

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:09.839
DUTY. CARGO AIR SHIPPING SO

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.274
REALLY DEVELOPING THIS

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:13.509
ECOSYSTEM. A LOT OF SYNERGIES

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:15.445
CAN COME OUT OF IT AND REALLY

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.480
BENEFIT HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:22.118
ADVANCEMENT OVERALL. SO HERE

HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES SO REALLY

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.564
INCREDIBLE RANGE AND- AS I

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:42.799
MENTIONED JUST FIVE MINUTES

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.927
THE FUEL CELLS. WHAT ARE THE

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.028
PRIORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS OF

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.729
THE OR THE CUSTOMERS

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:15.298
CONSIDERING THIS TECHNOLOGY. A

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:17.867
LOT OF WAYS- WHAT CUSTOMERS

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.702
CONSIDER IS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:21.304
SOME OF THE OTHER ZERO EMISSION

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.572
VEHICLE CUSTOMERS LIKE BETH

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.740
CUSTOMERS. THEY CARE ABOUT

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:27.276
EFFICIENCY. RANGE AND OF COURSE

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:28.678
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND YOU

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:31.180
SEE SOME OF THAT- HIGHLIGHTED

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.149
IN BLUE ON THE LEFT. WHERE THE

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:34.383
FUEL CELL SHOPPERS ARE UNIQUE

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.219
IS A FOCUS ON CONVENTIONAL

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:37.887
FEELING AS I MENTIONED AND

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.355
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS IS

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.656
REALLY SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.158
THAT WE NEED TO BUILD OUT

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:42.859
BECAUSE AGAIN THEY LIKE THE

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:45.061
FACT THAT. THESE VEHICLES FUEL

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:46.596
THE SAME WAY THAT THEY'RE USED

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:47.697
TO BUT THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:49.398
THERE'S ENOUGH FUELING STATIONS

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.968
AVAILABLE- AND THAT'S REALLY

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.336
WHAT WE SEE IS AS CRITICAL TO

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.937
CONSIDERATION AND CAN BE A TOP

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:57.573
BARRIER. IF WE DON'T BUILD OUT

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:02.311
THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE TALK TO

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.147
OUR NEXT SO OWNERS OBVIOUSLY-

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.581
WE TRY TO GET AS MUCH FEEDBACK

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:06.582
AS POSSIBLE WE'RE HAPPY TO

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:08.451
REPORT. NEXT OWNERS DO LOVE

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.319
THEIR CAR- FOR SOME OF THE

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:12.088
TRADITIONAL REASONS PEOPLE MAY

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:13.856
LOVE THEIR CARS THE DESIGN THE

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:16.092
DRIVING EXPERIENCE. I MENTIONED

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.827
THE RANGE IS IMPORTANT TO US

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:19.962
HAVE CUSTOMERS OF UP TO THREE

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:21.330
HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES. BUT THEY

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:22.165
REALLY LOVE IT BECAUSE IT

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.533
REPRESENTS A PARENT EARLY

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.134
ADOPTER THEY HAVE SOMETHING

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.802
SPECIAL IS UNIQUE THEY REALLY

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:29.071
EMBRACE THIS TECHNOLOGY- AND

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.706
THEY NOT ONLY ARE THEY LIKELY

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:32.208
TO PURCHASE ANOTHER NEXT SO BUT

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:35.378
THERE ARE ALSO LIKELY TO.

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:38.447
RECOMMEND THE NEXT. ON THE FLIP

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.283
SIDE THOUGH WHAT THEY DON'T LOG

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:42.318
IN WHAT WE'RE HEARING. A LOT

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.586
FROM SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS MOST

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:44.720
RECENTLY IS THAT ALL OF THE

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.923
FUELING EXPERIENCE. AND THERE'S

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:47.790
A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THE

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.725
SLIDE BUT I THINK- SOME OF THE

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.961
IMAGES REALLY CONVEY. THE POINT

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:53.996
DAMAGE ON THE RIGHT. IS A LINE

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:57.033
OF FUEL CELL VEHICLES TAKEN- I

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.801
THINK MAYBE IN TWENTY NINETEEN.

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:00.369
WAITING TO RE FUEL SO YOU

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:01.504
REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.906
YOU DON'T WANT CUSTOMERS. TO

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:05.708
HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME. TO

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:07.743
GET FUEL FOR THEIR CARS. SO

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.246
REALLY- ON A HIGH LEVEL- SOME

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.247
OF THE KEY POINTS OF IT

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:13.749
EXPERIENCING. OFTEN RELIABILITY

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.484
ISSUES AND DOWNTIME DAMAGE ON

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:17.353
THE LOWER RIGHT IS TAKEN JUST

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.888
LAST WEEK. WHEN THE FUEL CELL

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:20.790
PARTNERSHIP'S WEBSITE AND YOU

01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:23.192
SEE THE RED- THE RED SQUARES

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:24.427
AND THAT INDICATES SOME OF THE

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:25.995
STATIONS ARE DOWN FOR WHATEVER

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:27.563
REASON. SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:28.197
CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:30.533
EXPERIENCING- OBVIOUSLY WE TALK

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.767
ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.436
LIMITED NUMBER STATION SO THIS

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:34.403
IS SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICAL TO

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.405
EXPAND. AND EVEN ISSUES WITH

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:37.673
THE PUMP THEMSELVES OF THE IF

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.908
THE STATION IS WORKING AND

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:41.577
THERE IS FUEL- YES SOME

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.246
TECHNICAL ISSUES AND HOW TO

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:45.081
FUEL THE PUMPS FREEZING. SO

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:46.282
IT'S REALLY BROUGHT ABOUT SOME

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:48.050
INTERESTING BUYER BEHAVIOR THE

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:49.685
BUYERS REALLY NEED TO- FEEL SO

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:51.454
DRIVERS REALLY NEED TO PLAN THE

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.623
ROUTES CAREFULLY. AND EVEN GO

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:55.591
TO- STATIONS WHEN THEY HAVE A

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:57.226
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUEL LEFT

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:59.295
A HUNDRED MILES OR MORE. JUST

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.429
IF THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:02.798
FEEL UP THEY WILL JUST TO-

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:03.266
HOPEFULLY THE VOID THE

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:08.871
SITUATION OF. OF NOT HAVING

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:11.407
FUEL THEY'LL- SO- IN SOME REAL

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:13.009
CLOSE WITH SOLUTIONS FOR THE

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:15.011
CONSIDERATION AND- HERE HYUNDAI

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:17.947
WE DO REALIZE- TO ADVANCED FUEL

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.548
CELL AND HYDROGEN WHICH WERE

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:21.384
FIRMLY BEHIND AS THE TECHNOLOGY

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.252
AS A COMPANY. WE REALIZE THIS

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:24.553
NEEDS TO BE A COMBINED EFFORT

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.088
BOTH FROM THE PRIVATE SIDE AND

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:28.324
PUBLIC SIDE. AND ON OUR PART ON

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:29.625
THE PRIVATE SIDE WE ARE

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:30.960
ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:33.462
PARTNERSHIPS. TO DEVELOP THIS

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:34.163
INFRASTRUCTURE WE THINK IT'S

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.998
CRITICAL. I'M WE'RE WE'RE

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:37.266
PURSUING PARTNERSHIPS WITH IN

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.768
CALIFORNIA EVEN OUTSIDE OF

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:40.803
CALIFORNIANS WE HOPE- TO

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.572
SPREAD- THE DOBSON OF FUEL CELL

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.074
AND HYDROGEN EVEN OUTSIDE OF

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:46.776
CALIFORNIA VENTRALLY. AND

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:47.943
OBVIOUSLY OUR CUSTOMERS ARE

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.245
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO WE WANT

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:50.446
TO SUPPORT THEM IN THIS

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:52.381
TRANSITIONAL TIME SO. ANYWAY

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:53.516
THAT WE CAN ASSIST OUR

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.418
CUSTOMERS WERE CHALLENGED. WITH

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:56.485
THE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:05:56.552 --> 01:06:00.256
UNTIL SUPPLY. WE FIND WAYS TO

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:01.457
DO THAT. ON THE SIDE WE DO

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:02.992
PROPOSE SOME SOLUTIONS FOR

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.994
CONSIDERATION. I'M OBVIOUSLY

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:07.096
LONG TERM DEDICATED FUNDING FOR

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:08.931
HYDROGEN STATIONS WITH. THE

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.900
GOAL OF AS MANY AS A THOUSAND

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.702
STATIONS IN OPERATION BY TWENTY

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:14.036
THIRTY AND WE KNOW THIS IS. AN

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.638
AMBITIOUS GOAL REALLY THINK

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:18.641
HAVING A HUGE- REALLY- ROBUST

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:21.143
INFRASTRUCTURE WILL.

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:24.246
EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE- THE

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.481
FINAL FUEL CELLS ON THE ROAD.

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:26.949
OBVIOUSLY ONE FUEL CELLS TO BE

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.951
ELIGIBLE LONG TERM FOR- ANY

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:29.885
STATE INCENTIVES THAT ARE

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:31.654
OFFERED TO OTHER- ZERO EMISSION

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:33.422
VEHICLES. AND EVEN

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:35.124
CONSIDERATION OF TAX INCENTIVES

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.793
FOR- GASOLINE STATION OPERATORS

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.462
TO CONVERT THEIR CURRENT

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:41.397
STATIONS TWO HUNDRED. AND

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:42.198
FINALLY I THINK THIS WAS

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:43.899
MENTIONED EARLIER OF THE NOTION

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:45.601
OF FUEL SUBSIDIES TO ACHIEVE

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.803
PRICE PARITY HYDROGEN. IT IS

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:49.338
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN GASOLINE SO

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.674
WE THINK IF THERE'S A LEVEL-

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.442
PARITY WITH GASOLINE THIS WILL

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:54.944
GET A LOT OF- CONSUMERS

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:56.645
INTERESTED IN HYDROGEN WITH THE

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:59.849
RIGHT STRUCTURE. SO AGAIN-

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:00.850
SUBMIT SOLUTIONS FIRST

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:03.619
CONSIDERATION- WE WOULD LOVE TO

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:05.654

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:07.590
JUST WANT TO THANK- COMMITTEE

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:53.903
T. T. SI STORY. I THINK. LET ME

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:55.438
START OUT BY SAYING THAT

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:56.972
ALTHOUGH A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.574
IS BEGINNING TO LIGHT DUTY WE

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:01.644
ARE 1100% HEAVY DUTY USE. WE

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:04.046
SERVICE SUPPORTS IN NOT ONLY

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:05.147
CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:07.450
UNITED STATES WERE IN SEATTLE

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:09.318
WHERE IN NEW JERSEY WHERE IT'S

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:09.852
JUST OUT OF GEORGIA WERE

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:13.055
CHICAGO. A WIN SEATTLE TACOMA.

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:14.857
AND A COMMON SCHEME MOST COURTS

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.292
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IS

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.994
THAT WERE BASED IN. GENERALLY

01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:21.297
THE INNER CITY GENERALLY

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.065
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IT'S-

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:25.468
SO THEY NEED TO GET TO ZERO

01:08:25.534 --> 01:08:30.372
EMISSIONS IS A CENTRAL- PTS I

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.907
STARTED ITS JOURNEY BACK THAT

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.742
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THE

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.311
PORTS OF LONG BEACH AND LOS

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:38.414

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.583
CLEAN AIR ACTION PROGRAM WE

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.551
STARTED TO DO A LOT OF INTERNAL

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.320
INVESTIGATION INTO EXACTLY

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:46.055
WHERE THIS WHERE THIS WOULD

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.857
LEAD. AND WE DETERMINED THAT

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:49.358
THE GULF COAST REGION TEN YOU

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:51.160
TO MOVE UNTIL WE WERE ADIZERO

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:53.329
MISSION. SO WE MADE A CORPORATE

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.830
DECISION TO GO TO ZERO EMISSION

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:56.098
WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO ZERO

01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:58.367
EMISSION IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:00.069
HE PLANNED TO DO THIS ON A

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:02.538
NATIONAL BASIS. IN CALIFORNIA

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:05.007
CURRENTLY WE ARE ALMOST 1100%

01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:07.510
OUT OF DIESEL. OUR JOURNEY THE

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.745
LAST. ELEVEN OR TWELVE YEARS

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.848
HAS BEEN MAJORLY. AS A

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.750
CONVERSION INTO NATURAL GAS. WE

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.819
HAVE HEAVILY EACH WE HAVE

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.487
HEAVILY EXPERIMENTED WITH.

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:21.390
BATTERY ELECTRIC WITH FUEL AND

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.325
WITH FUEL CELL AS WELL. WE HAVE

01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:26.161
A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT ALL THE

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:27.963
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE-

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:29.498
IT'S BEEN A VERY VERY BY BEING

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:31.700
VERY VERY RANGY GRINDING ROAD

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:33.869
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:35.237
USE AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES-

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:38.641
WON'T. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.442
NATURAL GAS IS THAT IT TOOK US

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:43.145
TEN YEARS AND FIVE ITERATIONS

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:44.647
OF AN ENGINE TO GET TO AN

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:46.982
ENGINE THAT WE ARE VERY VERY

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.217
COMFORTABLE WITH WHICH IS

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:52.321
GIVING US LOW KNOCKS- AND LOW

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:56.158
CARBON. FOOTPRINT AND THE

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:59.128
ENGINE WORKS BY. VERY VERY WELL

01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:00.930
IT'S COMPLETELY REBUILT

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:03.465
REPLACED ALL OF THE DEMANDS

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:05.301
THAT WE PUT ON A T. SHIRT

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:08.103
DIESEL VEHICLES WE ARE HOPING

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.072
TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS WITH

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:11.907
BATTERY ELECTRIC AND HOPEFULLY

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:14.476
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL. I HAVE TO

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.312
ADMIT THAT DR BROUWER'S

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.714
PRESENTATION GAVE ME A GREAT

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:21.116
DEAL OF HOPE BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:24.520
BEEN YOU KNOW TRYING TO DECIDE

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:26.655
WHAT WOULD BE THE TECH BEST

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:29.525
TECHNOLOGY FOR US LONG TERM WE

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:34.697
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT- D. THE

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:38.167
GREAT REQUIREMENTS AND THE DO

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:39.969
YOU STRESS THAT WILL FIT ON THE

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:41.770
GRID FOR ST BATTERY ELECTRIC

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:43.606
CLASS EIGHT VEHICLES WILL BE

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.307
SUSTAINABLE WE THINK THAT

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:50.179
THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY VERY

01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:51.780
DIFFICULT GOAL TO REACH. WE

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.582
HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH HYDROGEN

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:55.284
AND THE ISSUES THAT WE THAT WE

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.686
HAVE. I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.321
HYDROGEN ARE NUMBER ONE.

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:02.458
NATURALLY THE ISSUE THE COST OF

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:04.460
THE VEHICLES THE VEHICLES ARE

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:06.495
THE KEY DEMONSTRATION REELS

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.597
THAT WE USE ARE EXTREMELY

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:12.067
EXPENSIVE. AND EXTREMELY- WE'VE

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:15.170
HAS A LOT OF ISSUES WITH- WITH

01:11:15.237 --> 01:11:17.339
THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. I MANY

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:20.442
TIMES THE- THE CHILL CELLS ARE

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.511
UNDER POWERED THE TECHNOLOGY

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.246
TRUCK IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.548
BECAUSE- IT'S A VERY VERY

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:29.551
TECHNICAL INSTRUMENT UNLIKE THE

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:33.422
AUTOMOBILES. WHICH TEND TO BE

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.124
MORE RELIABLE. FROM EIGHT AM AT

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:36.425
AS WE UNDERTAKE ANY OF THESE

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.993
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES WE

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.763
ALWAYS LOOK TO. BE SEX SELF

01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:42.498
SUSTAINABLE FROM A FUEL SOURCE

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:46.001
SO EVEN WITH NATURAL GAS WE

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:47.903
LOOKED AT EITHER A LEASING

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.972
STATIONS OURSELVES OR BUILDING

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:53.342
STATIONS. IN OUR FACILITIES TO

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:55.210
SERVICE OUR FLEET AS WE LOOK TO

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:56.912
HYDROGEN AS WE LOOKED INTO A TO

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.580
BATTERY ELECTRIC WE'RE ALSO

01:11:58.647 --> 01:11:59.515
LOOKING FOR THOSE KIND OF

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:01.050
SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE CANNOT BE

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:03.152
AT THE MERCY OF THE NETWORK NOT

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.620
BEING ABLE TO MEET OUR DEMANDS

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:06.221
BECAUSE WE WILL FAIL. TO

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:08.490
SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS SO WHEN

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:09.525
WE LOOK AT THESE PROJECTS WE

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:11.427
LOOK AT IT FROM THE ASPECT OF

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:14.396
TOTALITY WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO.

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:16.699
SURVIVE FROM FROM CRADLE TO

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:19.735
GRAVE WITH THE WITH THE FUEL

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:22.971
AND THE AND THE TECHNOLOGY

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:24.807
ITSELF. WE HAVE MADE A GREAT

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:27.476
DEAL WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.344
IN MOVING FORWARD ON THE-

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:31.814
BATTERY ELECTRIC FRONT. AGAIN

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.048
WE'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:36.652
THE- THE- THE GREAT ITSELF IN

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:39.121
THE POWER SOURCE. NOW WE'RE

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.155
WE'RE STARTING TO TAKE

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:41.924
DELIVERIES OF WE JUST TOOK

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.759
DELIVERY OF THE TOYOTA FUEL

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:45.227
CELL WE HAVE ANOTHER TOYOTA

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:47.062
FUEL CELL COMING WE'RE GONNA BE

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:48.731
TAKING DELIVERY OF SOME

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.132
ADDITIONAL FUEL CELLS FROM

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:52.334
TRANSPOWER. AND WE'VE SIGNED AN

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:55.471
AGREEMENT WITH NICHOLAW FOR

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.606
SIXTY FUEL CELL VEHICLES AND

01:12:57.673 --> 01:12:58.474
FORTY BATTERY ELECTRIC

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:02.811
VEHICLES- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:05.481
OUR PLAN IS TO. SLOWLY NOW

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.116
TRANSITION OUT OF NATURAL GAS

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:10.552
IN CALIFORNIA AND TRANSITION

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:13.355
INTO A FULL. ZERO EMISSIONS

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:16.825
FLEET- AND AS YOU'VE HEARD

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:20.262
THERE ARE THERE'S THE D. JUST

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:22.364
FROM THE LIGHT DUTY SIDE THE

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:25.234
REQUIREMENTS FROM THE- USERS

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.169
ARE REALLY ALL BOIL DOWN TO

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:30.672
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I WOULD I

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:32.508
COMMEND THE WORK THAT CARBON

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:33.809
AND G. H. U. N. G. ARE DOING

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:35.611
AND HELPING DEVELOP AN EXTRA

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:37.679
TRIP BUT I THINK AND I BELIEVE

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.648
WE NEED A LOT MORE WORK DONE IN

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:42.217
THIS AREA. AND AGAIN I HAVE TO

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:44.853
STRESS THE COST THE COST OF

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.122
THESE VEHICLES AND THE COST OF

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.691
THE FUEL ITSELF. AFTER COME

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.493
DOWN DRAMATICALLY FOR IN ORDER

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.961
FOR US TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:56.298
THE MARKETPLACE. BEING YOU KNOW

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:59.334
KIND OF A AN AN AN INITIAL USER

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:00.869
WE ARE TO TREMENDOUS

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:03.572
COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE- ACT

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.140
WHEN WE GO UP AGAINST THE

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:08.110
MARKET THAT IS EITHER. I'M

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:11.380
WILLING TO MAKE THE SWITCH OR

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:13.515
IS LYING BACK IN THE TRUCK AND

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.684
WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO.

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:16.718
YOU KNOW TAKE ALL THE ARROWS IN

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:19.888
THE BACK. AND WE JUST WE JUST

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.523
WANTED STATE COMMITTED AND WE

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:22.558
JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:26.128
FORWARD TO GET TO. ZERO MEASURE

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:28.630
AND THE INFORMATION THAT I-

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.265

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:00.148
LINE SHOWING WITH THE HIGHEST

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:02.284
DE. OF POLLUTION IS IF YOU'RE

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:03.218
FAMILIAR WITH THE EAST BAY

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:06.388
REGION THIS TRACKS THE EIGHT

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:07.322
EIGHTY HIGHWAY THROUGH EAST

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.524
OAKLAND STARTING IN SAN LEANDRO

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:11.059
UP THROUGH EAST OAKLAND. AND

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.794
THEN HERE INTO WEST OAKLAND

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:15.564
AROUND THE PORT AND SO THIS IS

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:18.433
WHERE WE SEE THE CONTINUED

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.302
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF AIR

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:23.772
POLLUTION. AND ASTHMA CANCER

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:25.073
AND ALL OF THE NEGATIVE HEALTH

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.842
IMPACTS BECOME WITHOUT

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:28.543
POLLUTION. AND THIS IS

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:30.812
PREDOMINATELY OVER AN AFRICAN

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:32.314
AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:34.282
PREDOMINANTLY OVER LOWER INCOME

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:35.450
COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:38.153
SUBJECTED FOR DECADES. TO THIS

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.888
DISPROPORTIONATE AIR POLLUTION

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:42.424
AND THAT IS COMING LARGELY FROM

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:44.026
DIESEL PARTICULATE EMISSIONS

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:46.528
FROM TRUCKS. AND SO THIS IS A

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:48.964
TRUCK CORRIDOR IT SERVES NOT

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:50.265
ONLY THE PORT OF OAKLAND BUT

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:52.401
ALSO TO VARIOUS WAREHOUSES AND

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.436
OTHER FACILITIES. AND THE

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.670
DIESEL EMISSIONS FROM THE

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:58.173
TRUCKS ARE THE MAJOR SOURCE OF

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.208
HELP FORMING POLLUTION IN THIS

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:03.045
AREA. AND SO FIGURING OUT HOW

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:05.414
TO DO ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. IS

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.182
REALLY ESSENTIAL BOTH TO THE

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:09.551
GLOBAL CLIMATE AND TO THE HUMAN

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.887
HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:13.922
ARE MOST DESPERATELY IMPACTED.

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:16.191
AND SO WE HAVE PURSUED ALL OF

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:16.825
THE DIFFERENT AVAILABLE

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:19.161
TECHNOLOGIES WE DO HAVE SOME

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:21.063
BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCKS AS WELL

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:23.365
AS BATTERY AND HYBRID ELECTRIC

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:25.300
CRANES GOING IN AT THE PORT OF

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:27.035
OAKLAND- AND SOME THAT HAVE

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:29.071
ALREADY BEEN INSTALLED. BUT

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:30.872
WHEN IT COMES TO A LONG HOLD

01:18:30.939 --> 01:18:33.275
VEHICLES THE BATTERIES ARE NOT

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:35.310
SUFFICIENT AND SO IT IS VITAL

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.512
THAT WE ALSO INCLUDE AND EXPAND

01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:39.714
THE USE. OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:41.883
WHICH HAS THE DURABILITY AS

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.718
WELL AS THE ABILITY TO SERVE

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:45.787
THOSE LONGER DISTANCES. IN

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:48.523
BETWEEN FUELING AND SO WE ARE

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:50.492
SUPER GRATEFUL FOR THE NEW

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:51.359
STATE FUNDING THAT WAS

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:53.428
ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY IT WILL

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:55.597
ALLOW US TO LAUNCH A MAJOR

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:59.534
FUELING STATION- IN PARTNERSHIP

01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:00.135
WITH THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND A

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:01.470
BATCH OF TRUCKS. AND OF COURSE

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:03.004
HAVING THIS FEELING STATION

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:04.339
WILL ALLOW US TO ATTRACT OTHER

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:06.541
TRUCKS EVEN BEYOND THE ONES

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:07.676
THAT ARE PART OF THE GRANT

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:10.645
FUNDED PROJECT. I WOULD ALSO

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:14.216
NOTE THAT. THE ABILITY TO DRIVE

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:16.885
THEM ON THE STREETS WITH THAT

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:19.354
NEEDED WICKS ARE ALSO PART OF

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:20.355
THE PATH THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:23.058
LOOKING AT. END IN ADDITION WE

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.093
ARE PURSUING LONGER TERM THE

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.661
ABILITY TO HAVE LOCALLY

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.630
PRODUCED SUSTAINABLY PRODUCED

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:30.599
HYDROGEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:32.467
EAST BAY MUD WHICH IS OUR WASTE

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:35.303
WATER HANDLING- UTILITY. AND SO

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:36.605
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:38.573
CERTAINLY TO BE LOOKING TO FIND

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.475
ARE THE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:43.044
OF HYDROGEN THAT THAT IS ONE OF

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:45.280
THE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS THE WE

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:46.715
ARE PURSUING AND THAT SHOULD BE

01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:49.050
PART OF OUR FUTURE. I WOULD

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:51.186
ALSO NOTE STATE LAST SUMMER

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:52.821
WHEN WE HAD SOME OF THE WORST

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.923
AIR QUALITY DAYS OF ALL TIME

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:57.092
WHEN IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT AND

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:57.893
WE WERE COVERED WITH SMOKE FROM

01:19:57.959 --> 01:20:00.428
WILDFIRES. IT LARGE FACILITIES

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:01.796
LIKE THE PORT OF OAKLAND WERE

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.665
DIRECTED TO CUT BACK ON THEIR

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.834
ELECTRICITY USE WERE DIRECTED

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:08.036
TO STOP ELECTRICITY USE AND SO

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.704
A PATH TOWARDS ZERO EMISSIONS

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:10.739
THAT RELIES PURELY ON

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:13.175
ELECTRICITY WAS THEN SHUT DOWN

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.976
ON THE WORST POLLUTION DAYS.

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.178
AND THEY WERE TOLD TO THEN TURN

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:18.246
ON DIESEL. BECAUSE OF THE

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.881
INABILITY TO USE THE ELECTRICAL

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:22.184
GRID HYDROGEN FUEL CELL CAN

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:24.186
SOLVE THAT PROBLEM WE CAN HAVE

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:25.620
SOMETHING THAT IS ZERO

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:26.454
EMISSIONS THAT DOES NOT

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:29.090
POLLUTE. AND WHICH ALSO IS

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:31.092
AVAILABLE TO BE USED EVEN ON

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.028
DAYS WHEN THE ELECTRIC GRID MAY

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.896
BE STRAINED AND IN FACT THE USE

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:36.965
OF HYDROGEN CAN REDUCE THAT

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:39.834
STRAIN ON THE ELECTRICITY GRID.

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:42.671
SO THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:45.507
FOR OUR REGION AS WELL AS FOR

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.742
OUR GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY. ONE

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:48.810
OF THE OTHER THINGS I THINK

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:50.111
IT'S USEFUL TOTHINK ABOUT IN

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:52.547
THIS CONTEXT IS THAT FREIGHT IS

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:54.849
OFTEN LEFT OUT OF THE CONTEXT

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:56.184
OF REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:58.386
PLANNING AND OTHER EFFORTS AND

01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:01.022
YET FREE IS. A FAR MORE

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:02.757
SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF POLLUTION

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:04.893
IN TRANSPORTATION SO FOR

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.261
EXAMPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:07.729
HAS EIGHT CASH FOR CLUNKERS

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:09.698
PROGRAM FOR CARS WHERE YOU CAN

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:13.235
TURN IN A POLLUTING OLD CAR FOR

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:13.802
MONEY AND IT GETS TAKEN OFF

01:21:13.868 --> 01:21:16.171
ROAD. WE ALSO NEED A CASH FOR

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:18.039
CLUNKERS PROGRAM FOR TRUCKS WE

01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:19.741
HAVE BAD POLITICAL TRUST THAT

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:21.343
COULD BE BOUGHT AND TAKEN OFF

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:23.778
THE ROAD. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:25.347
THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:27.048
REDUCE EMISSIONS AND REDUCE

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:28.683
POLLUTION WE NEED TO

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.452
INCORPORATE FREE AS WELL AS

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:32.654
PASSENGER VEHICLES. AS WE LOOK

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:35.123
AT THESE STRATEGIES. ONE OF THE

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:36.925
ADVANTAGES OF LOOKING AT

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:39.361
CENTRALLY LOCATED FUELED LEADS

01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:41.263
IS THAT WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:43.365
INCREASE THE USE OF HYDROGEN

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:45.133
EVEN AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.202
OUT MORE STATIONS. SO WHEN YOU

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:49.304
HAVE A FACILITY LIKE A PORT. IT

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:51.239
IS SERVED BY MANY VEHICLES

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:52.741
HAVING HYDROGEN FUELING IN

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:55.277
THOSE LOCATIONS CAN GREATLY

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:58.246
ENABLED THE UPTAKE BY MANY MORE

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:00.315
USERS WHO USE THOSE FACILITIES.

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:01.883
IN ADDITION THE NEW FUELING

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.418
STATION AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:05.954
WILL ALLOW HYDROGEN TRUCKS TO

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:07.389
SERVE THE ENTIRE NORTHERN

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:08.556
CALIFORNIA TO SOUTHERN

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:09.991
CALIFORNIA CORRIDOR WITH

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:12.394
FUELING AVAILABLE ON BOTH ENDS.

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.429
AS WELL AS SERVING AREAS BEYOND

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.331
HERE URTHER NORTH AND FURTHER

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:18.733
EAST. SO IT IS AS SOME OF THE

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.201
OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE POINTED OUT

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:21.936
VITALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THOSE

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:23.672
FUELING STATIONS AND TO HAVE

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:25.740
THEM IN THE LOCATIONS WHERE

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:28.443
THEY ARE NEEDED. TO MAXIMIZE

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:30.779
THESE USES IN WAYS THAT REDUCE

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.047
THE POLLUTION REDUCE THE

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.282
IMPACTS ON OUR COMMUNITY AND

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:35.684
EVEN ALLOW US TO PRODUCE OUR

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.852
OWN FUEL FROM WASTE SO WE

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:39.587
ENCOURAGE THAT THAT BE PART OF

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:42.057
WHAT IS EXPANDED. IN THE

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:42.991
RESEARCH AND FUNDING GOING

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:45.226
FORWARD AS WELL AS PROGRAMS

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:47.262
LIKE THOSE BEING LAUNCHED NOW

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:48.830
FOR THE TRUCKS AND THE FUELING

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:51.433
STATIONS. AS WE SEE MORE AND

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.668
MORE ADOPTION OF THESE HEAVY

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.804
DUTY USES THOSE FILLING

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:58.306
STATIONS ALSO CAN ENABLE THE

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:00.475
LIGHT DUTY USERS AS WELL SO WE

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:02.310
CAN SERVE BOTH AS NEEDED IN

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:04.713
SOME FACILITIES. BUT I THINK

01:23:04.779 --> 01:23:05.814
IT'S VITAL THAT WE NOT LEAVE

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.782
OUT THE HEAVY DUTY USES AS

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:09.284
THOSE CAN HAVE A VERY DRAMATIC

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:11.386
IMPACT. ON REDUCING THE

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:12.721
POLLUTION IMPACTS ON OUR

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:14.723
COMMUNITIES AND HAVING SEEN

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.791
OVER TWENTY YEARS THE SUCCESS

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:19.060
OF THE AC TRANSIT HYDROGEN FUEL

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:21.429
CELL BUSES WHICH ARE A SIMILAR

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.531
SIZE TO WHAT WE SEE FOR TRUCKS.

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:24.899
WE KNOW THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:23:24.966 --> 01:23:26.434
CAN WORK WELL FOR THE HEAVY

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:29.537
DUTY USES AND SO I WANTED TO

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:31.439
SHARE THAT GOOD NEWS AND THAT.

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:34.542
THOUGHT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND

01:23:34.609 --> 01:23:35.110
I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THE EXIT

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.678
SINCE OF THIS COME. AND HAPPY

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.413
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AS

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.948
WE WORK TO IMPROVE OUR

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:41.383
ENVIRONMENT AND THE HEALTH OF

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:43.251
OUR COMMUNITIES. AND BUILD A

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:45.220
MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE THANK

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:46.488
YOU SO MUCH FOR THE TIME AND

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:49.891
ATTENTION. THANK YOU MADAM VICE

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:52.127
MAYOR- SO STAND BY WE'RE GOING

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:55.330
pGOING TO ASK SOME OF THE

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:57.432
SENATORS WHO ARE HOPEFULLY ARE

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:59.434
STILL WITH US SENATOR BEN ALLEN

CENTER JOSH NEWMAN AND CENTER

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.144
NANCY SKINNER SO SENATORS- THE

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.446
FLOORS OPEN IF YOU'D LIKE TO-

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:12.981
JUMP IN WITH QUESTIONS YOU'RE

01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:16.317
MORE THAN WELCOME. ANY

01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:16.918
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM OUR

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:23.591
SENATORS. ANYONE ON THE LINE.

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:25.927
IF NOT I'M GOING TO START OFF

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:27.095
WITH A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:30.131
PHILLIPS- ARE VERY FIRST

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:32.333
PANELISTS IF YOU RECALL THE

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.536
DOCTOR- JACK BAUER HERE'S MY

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:37.872
QUESTION TO YOU THAT- TO GET

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:40.542
THIS COSTS DOWN OF HYDROGEN-

01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.343
AND TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:45.280
CARS NOW IN PRODUCTION. WHAT

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:48.183
WOULD YOUR RECOMMENDATION. WELL

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:49.517
FIRST OF ALL WE SHOULD

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:52.587
UNDERSTAND THAT THE- PLACE THAT

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:54.422
THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ON THE

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:57.592
COST CURVE IS VERY STEEP. IT

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:59.427
HAS NOT ENGENDERED AS MUCH

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:01.729
INVESTMENT AS THINGS LIKE SOLAR

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:03.798
BATTERIES AND THOSE TECHNOLOGY

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:05.567
IS WILL HAVE A SIMILAR COST

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:08.303
REDUCTION KERR BY I PREDICT TWO

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:10.572
COMPARED TO BATTERIES AND SOLAR

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:13.007
AND SO INVESTMENT IN THE

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:14.876
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE THE

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:19.280
EXPERIENCE. OF THE DRIVERS OKAY

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:20.648
ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:22.116
FUELING I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:23.318
IMPORTANT I THINK THIS IS THE

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:25.420
MOST CRITICAL ITEM THAT WE HAD

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:27.288
THAT WE FACE TODAY. TO MAKE

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:28.323
SURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD AN

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.258
ADEQUATE HYDROGEN SUPPLY

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:31.359
ADEQUATE HYDROGEN FUELING

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:32.260
STATIONS AN AT THE CEILING

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:33.528
STATIONS CONTINUE TO BE AN

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:37.298
OPERATION AND OPERATE WELL-

01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:41.569
THERE ALSO COULD BE- THE

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:44.072
CONSIDERATION OF. YOU KNOW HOW

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:46.274
L. CFS CREDITS ARE APPLIED IN

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:47.509
THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND I

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:48.843
THINK THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:55.450
GOVERNOR. FOR THIS FUELING

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:57.719
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE INCLUDED

01:25:57.785 --> 01:25:59.554
IN THE LCS US CREDIT SYSTEM I

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:02.457
THINK IT SHOULD CONTINUE. AND

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:04.025
THE WINNER WHEN A COUPLE OF

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:07.462
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- WHY IS A

01:26:07.529 --> 01:26:08.997
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY

01:26:09.063 --> 01:26:11.299
SO EXCITED ABOUT HYDROGEN IN

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:12.600
THEIR LINES IN THERE WITH

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:14.302
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HYDROGEN

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:17.438
INDUSTRY. BUT LET ME SUGGEST I

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.474
THINK IT OFFERS THEM ONE OF THE

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:21.743
MOST PROMISING VECTORS FOR

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:23.745
RETAINING A REASONABLE BUSINESS

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:27.582
IN A ZERO EMISSIONS WORLD- FROM

01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:29.150
MY PERSPECTIVE THE WELL IT'S

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:31.386
OBVIOUS IT'S A LAW THAT WE WILL

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:33.721
NOT BE USING FOSSIL FUELS IN

01:26:33.788 --> 01:26:35.256
TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND IF

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:37.191
THAT'S THE CASE THERE NEEDS TO

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:39.894
BE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT CAN THAT

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:41.729
CAN BE USED THAT CAN USE THEIR

01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:43.665
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I SUGGEST

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.300
ALSO THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:47.268
IS VERY VALUABLE. THAT

01:26:47.335 --> 01:26:49.437
INFRASTRUCTURE SUPER VALUABLE

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:51.806
TO OUR ZERO EMISSIONS GOALS BUT

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.775
WE MUST TRANSFORM IT. CAN'T

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:56.044
JUST STATE- TRANSMITTING

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:58.580
FOSSEL- GAS NOT MAYBE A SMALL

01:26:58.646 --> 01:26:59.647
AMOUNT OF FOSSIL GAS COULD BE

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:01.082
USED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:02.183
WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.818
BUT I THINK THAT BY FAR AND

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:07.455
AWAY. THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:07.989
TRANSFORMATION WILL BE TO

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:09.457
RENEWABLE HYDROGEN. SO YOU

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:13.061
THINK THAT- INSERTING AT LEAST

01:27:13.127 --> 01:27:15.463
5% HYDROGEN INTO THE NATURAL

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.632
GAS PIPELINE WOULD BE SAFE IT

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.100
WOULD BE PRUDENT. AND IT WOULD

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:20.835
BE THE WAY OF THE FUTURE AND

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:24.005
ALSO- IT WOULD BE SAFE AT WITH

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:27.342
THAT NATURAL GAS FOR THE

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:27.942
PIPELINE TO THE USAGE IS THAT

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:29.477
CORRECT. BUT WE SUGGEST THAT

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.546
THERE ARE A VERY LARGE NUMBER

01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:34.015
OF RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:36.684
DEMONSTRATION- PROJECTS THAT

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:38.720
SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:41.789
WE WOULD. INJECT IT EVERYWHERE-

01:27:41.856 --> 01:27:43.524
BUT MOST OF THE STUDIES BOTH

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:45.693
HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.462
IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE

01:27:47.528 --> 01:27:49.497
FOUND THAT MIXTURES UP TO A

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:50.965
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE SOMEWHERE

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:53.234
BETWEEN TEN AND FIVE AND 20% OR

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:55.903
SO. ARE LIKELY TO BE VERY SAFE

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:58.139
UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES NOW

01:27:58.206 --> 01:27:59.007
AGAIN. THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:01.275
INVESTMENT TO MAKE SURE IT'S

01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:02.477
SAFE WHEREVER WE'RE GOING TO DO

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:05.680
IT BUGS VERY IMPORTANTLY. V.

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:08.116
TRANSFORMATION OR THE

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:11.085
INTRODUCTION OF 5% IT IS NOT SO

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:13.054
IMPORTANT WITH REGARD TO

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:14.856
DECARBONISING GAS BECAUSE IT

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:15.923
DOESN'T GIVE US A BIG

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:17.258
DECARBONISATION IMPACT ON THE

01:28:17.325 --> 01:28:21.362
GAS SYSTEM. IT'S MOST IMPORTANT

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:22.764
FOR ENGENDERING. EIGHT

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:26.200
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY OFFTAKE

01:28:26.267 --> 01:28:28.636
IT'S FOR ENABLING THE STATE OF

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:30.004
CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:32.540
MASSIVELY INVEST IN SOLAR AND

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:34.876
WIND ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THAT

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:37.912
WILL BE THE BOSS TAKE WHEN WE

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:40.014
DON'T WANT IT RIGHT NOW LIKE

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:40.915
WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:42.417
WE'RE CURTAILING MASSIVE

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.318
AMOUNTS OF RENEWABLE

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:46.354
ELECTRICITY TODAY SO WHENEVER

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:48.423
THERE IS A CHEAPOR OTHERWISE

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:49.757
CURTAILED ELECTRICITY WE CAN

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:51.726
USE THE HYDROGEN VECTOR AND

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:53.327
INJECTION UP 25% IN THE GAS

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:55.997
SYSTEM WILL. ENABLE A LOT OF

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:57.231
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN SOLAR

01:28:57.298 --> 01:28:59.567
AND WIND AND LET ME LET ME JUST

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:02.136
MENTION THOUGH 5% IT INJECTION

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:03.471
IN THE GAS SYSTEM WILL BE

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:05.339
INVESTIGATED AND INVESTED IN

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:07.041
AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO DETERMINE

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:08.443
HOW YOU CAN TRANSFORM FROM THE

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:10.611
INITIAL PARTIAL DETERMINATION

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:11.846
DECARBONISATION OF THE GAS

01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:13.147
SYSTEM DOES START TO FIGURE

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:14.482
OUT- THIS IS WHERE WE REALLY

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:15.983
HAVE A LEAKAGE PROBLEM- THIS IS

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:17.318
WHERE IT REALLY WHERE WE

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:18.953
HAVEN'T- MATERIAL DEGRADATION

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.855
PROBLEMS AND YOU'LL START TO

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:21.756
SAY OKAY I'M GONNA TAKE THIS

01:29:21.823 --> 01:29:23.124
PIPE OUT AND I'M GONNA PUT IN A

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:24.692
DIFFERENT LIGHT. I'M TO TAKE

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:26.360
THIS VALVE OUT AMID PUT IN A

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:27.361
DIFFERENT DOLLARS WE'RE GOING

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:29.630
TO COPE THIS OVER HE AND THEN

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:32.734
IT CAN A 100% TYPE REGION IN

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.434
THE FUTURE. WHAT WE HAVE TO

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:34.936
START INVESTING IN AT AND THE

01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:39.607
5% IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:40.208
BEGINNING OF THE INVESTMENT.

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:42.210
INVESTING IN AND- HI JR NOVICE

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:43.644
IS THE WAY TO GO- SO OF GOT A

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:46.848
DISH QUESTIONS- LET'S SEE-

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:50.384
ANDREW MARTINEZ- I WOULD LIKE

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:52.520
TO ASK YOU- HE HAD MENTIONED

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:54.155
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF STATIONS

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:55.456
THAT ARE. THAT WOULD BE NEEDED

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:57.859
IN THE FUTURE- SO WHAT HAPPENS

01:29:57.925 --> 01:29:59.527
AFTER THAT THE TWO HUNDRED

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:01.662
STATIONS ARE PUT IN- ARE WE

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:03.364
GOING TO CONTINUE. LOOKING IN

01:30:03.431 --> 01:30:04.332
THAT DIRECTION WITH THE

01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:06.033
EXPANSION OF THE AUTOMOBILES

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.669
AND- THE POPULARITY OF THE FUEL

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:10.538
CELL CARS WHAT HAPPENS WITH

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:13.307
THAT NUMBER. WE LOOK INTO AN

01:30:13.374 --> 01:30:18.146
INCREASE. YES SO- OUR DRAFT

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:20.281
SELF SUFFICIENCY REPORT LOOKS

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:22.183
AT THIS QUESTION- IN TERMS OF

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.051
HYPOTHETICAL POTENTIAL FUTURE

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:27.054
SCENARIOS. AND WE HAVE LOOKED

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:29.557
AT POTENTIAL SCENARIOS THAT ARE

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.459
BILLED. I JUST A FEW MORE

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:33.594
STATIONS OUT TO ABOUT THREE

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.163
HUNDRED STATIONS OR SCENARIOS

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:38.432
THAT BUILD. UP TO- ABOUT ONE

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.201
THOUSAND STATIONS AND IN TWENTY

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:42.170
THIRTY AND MORE BEYOND- OUR

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:44.205
DRAFT REPORT. DISCUSSES THE

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:45.940
POSSIBILITIES OF THESE

01:30:46.007 --> 01:30:48.042
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS- BUT IN

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:50.745
TERMS OF ACTUAL THE ACTUAL-

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:53.247
DECISION MAKING THAT IS

01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:53.815
SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY

01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:58.052
CANNOT SPEAK TO- AND I THINK

01:30:58.119 --> 01:31:00.154
THAT WE CAN ALL FIND THAT WE'RE

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:01.322
ALL LOOKING FOR CLEAN

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:03.424
ENVIRONMENT AND OBVIOUSLY- I

01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:05.393
MENTIONED THE TREASURE CHEST OF

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:08.095
ENERGY. AND I'M SO GLAD THAT

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:10.331
YOU ARE PARTICIPATING TODAY

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:11.799
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE BY THE

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.000
PANELISTS THAN WHAT YOU'VE

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:15.937
HEARD THAT INCLUDING HYDROGEN

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.338
IN THAT TREASURE CHEST OF

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:19.607
ENERGY IS SO IMPORTANT. SO I'M

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:20.808
LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.343
YOU IN THE FUTURE ON THIS SO

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:23.344
LET'S GO OVER SOME OF THE

01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:26.747
OTHERS- AMERICAN RED CROSS.

01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:29.383
LESLIE MORE WE WERE CHAU OF

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:30.618
PROUD OF WHAT YOU DO THE

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:32.286
AMERICAN RED CROSS YOU HAD

01:31:32.353 --> 01:31:35.389
MENTIONED HOW. SOME OF YOUR

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:36.958
VEHICLES ARE. ARE RUNNING ON

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:39.026
HYDROGEN LIKE TO THANK YOU

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:40.361

THE AUTOMOBILE ITSELF- IT IS

01:31:58.145 --> 01:31:59.680
ACTUALLY THERE WERE NO

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:01.515

THE CHALLENGES IN THE ACTUAL

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:11.559
KILLING STATIONS IT JUST IT

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:12.126
JUST TAKES LIKE ONE LITTLE

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:14.929
THING A MECHANICAL ISSUE OR

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:16.397
SOMETHING TO KIND OF- TO SHUT

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:17.398
THE WHOLE STATION DOWN SO THAT

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:18.866
WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SURPRISE

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:21.202
BUT THE VEHICLE ITSELF. THEY'RE

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:22.570
THE ONES WE HAVE THE CHOI ARISE

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:24.472
THERE TWENTY SEVENTEENS THEY

01:32:24.538 --> 01:32:26.507
WERE GIFTED TO US WITH THIRTY

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:28.743
THOUSAND MILES ON THEM- OR LAST

01:32:28.809 --> 01:32:30.811
AND I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THEM

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:32.046
THEY THEY HANDLE REALLY WELL

01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:34.649
AND- I'M REALLY IMPRESSED WITH

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:36.384
THE TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY VERY

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:38.486
GOOD THANK YOU AND- HYUNDAI

01:32:38.552 --> 01:32:40.955

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:15.222
THINK IT WAS FOR TWO IS THAT

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:16.791
COMMENTS FROM A SMALL RIGHT

01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:19.026
BEFORE I PRESENTED. JUST WANT

THE TECHNOLOGY IS CHAU

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:40.107
COMPLICATED BUT IT'S GOING TO

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:41.675

EFFORT. TO HAVE THE HYDROGEN

01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:54.548
FUELING STATION AND THIS IS

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.750
SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:58.486
FOR OF FOR MULTIPLE YEARS WE

01:35:58.552 --> 01:36:00.721
RECOGNIZE THE MAJOR POLLUTION

01:36:00.788 --> 01:36:02.823
IMPACTS. AND I DO WANT TO SAY

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.358
THAT I'M VERY HOPEFUL FOR THE

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.594
TECHNOLOGY THERE IS ALSO AN

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.996
ECONOMIES OF SCALE ISSUE SO

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:10.397
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SOME OF

01:36:10.464 --> 01:36:11.565
THE BOMBS WITH SOME OF THE

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:13.000
INITIAL ROLLOUT OF SOME OF THE

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:14.969
STATIONS. AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.537
YOU KNOW ONCE THEY'RE START

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:18.572
BEING MORE OF THEM THE PRICE

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:20.708
WILL COME DOWN THE RELIABILITY

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.610
IMPROVES AND SO I THINK WE'RE

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:23.677
REALLY AT THIS POINT IN THE

01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:25.779
CURVE. WHERE A SIGNIFICANT

01:36:25.846 --> 01:36:27.448
INVESTMENT CAN MAKE A

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:30.184
TRANSFORMATION NOT ONLY IN THE

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:31.452
GRANT HELPING TO FUND

01:36:31.519 --> 01:36:33.254
ADDITIONAL VEHICLES BUT REALLY

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.089
GET US PAST THAT ECONOMIES OF

01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:37.691
SCALE ISSUE WHERE THERE WILL BE

01:36:37.758 --> 01:36:39.059
ENOUGH HYDROGEN FUELING

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:41.195
STATIONS. AND ANOTHER-

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:42.730
DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN FUELING

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.598
VEHICLES THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:46.934
HAVE MORE PEOPLE TRAINED IN HOW

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:48.536
TO MAINTAIN THEM. THE YOU'LL BE

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:49.770
ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH FUELING

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:51.372
STATIONS THE PEOPLE CAN

01:36:51.438 --> 01:36:54.175
RELIABLY GO TO THEM AND WITH

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:56.177
THE TRUCKS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

01:36:56.243 --> 01:36:58.179
SHOW THE RELIABILITY. BECAUSE

01:36:58.245 --> 01:36:59.213
COMPANIES WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.282
AT BUYING A TRUCK YOU KNOW THEY

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:02.650
NEED A FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL OF

01:37:02.716 --> 01:37:04.919
CERTAINTY OF THE RELIABILITY OF

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:07.421
THAT. AND SO ONCE WE ARE ABLE

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:09.390
TO SHOW THIS LAUNCH WITH THE

01:37:09.456 --> 01:37:11.692
MANY VEHICLES IT REALLY CAN BE

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.494
THE KIND OF TURNING POINT. THE

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:15.863
WILL INCENTIVIZE MANY MORE

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.531
PEOPLE TO DO IT AND ONCE MORE

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:19.233
PEOPLE ARE BUYING THEM THE

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.101
PRICE PER VEHICLE WILL GO DOWN

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:23.103
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIES OF

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:25.739
SCALE. IN THE PRODUCTION AND

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.141
YOU KNOW THE AND THANK YOU FOR

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:28.442
ASKING THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:30.411
ABOUT THE TRUCKS UGH NO

01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:31.946
DISRESPECT FOR WORKING ON THE

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:33.981
CARS THAT'S IMPORTANT TOO. BUT

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:35.316
IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN HEALTH

01:37:35.382 --> 01:37:37.918
IMPACT REMEDYING THE HISTORIES

01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:41.222
OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE

01:37:41.288 --> 01:37:41.855
MAKING SURE THAT WE YOUR ALSO

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:42.856
DEALING WITH THE TRUCK. IS

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:45.059
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:46.760
OF THE ASTHMA AND THE OTHER

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:48.696
NEGATIVE HEALTH HEALTH IMPACTS.

01:37:48.762 --> 01:37:50.030
OF TRUCK POLLUTION SO I'M

01:37:50.097 --> 01:37:52.233
REALLY GRATEFUL- THAT THAT IS

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:54.301

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:15.883
NEED FOR A TRULY INTEGRATED

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:17.618
TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY

01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:19.820
SYSTEM. I THINK THAT'S LACKING

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.088
IN POLICY AND WE HAVE A LITTLE

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:22.756
BIT OF WORK TAT WE NEED TO DO

01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:25.392
FOR THAT AND I THINK THIS IS A

01:39:25.459 --> 01:39:26.694
BIG STEP FORWARD TO ACHIEVE

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.595
THOSE ENDS. YOU ASKED A MOMENT

01:39:28.662 --> 01:39:30.631
AGO ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT WE

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.866
MIGHT PURSUE IN ORDER TO LOWER

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:35.235
THE COST OF HYDROGEN FUEL AND

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:36.637
SO I JUST WANT TO OFFER AND IT

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:37.871

TESTIMONY. THAT JUST BE

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.375
CURTAILED ENERGY BACK

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:43.577
CALIFORNIA- YOU KNOW GROUNDS

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:46.080
ARE GIVES AWAY OR PAYS YOU KNOW

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:48.248
ARIZONA TO TAKE FROM US IF WE

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:50.517
WERE TO TURN THAT INTO POWER TO

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:52.252
CREATE HYDROGEN WE WOULD HAVE

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:53.987
BEEN ABLE TO FUEL TWO HUNDRED

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:54.888
THOUSAND VEHICLES JUST LAST

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:55.956
YEAR SO AN INCREDIBLE

01:39:56.023 --> 01:39:57.725
OPPORTUNITY. FOR THIS OTHERWISE

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.193
CURTAILED POWER THAT WE WOULD

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:00.361
LIKE TO EXPLORE PERHAPS

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:01.628
WHOLESALE RATING OR SOMETHING

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:03.297
LIKE THAT SO THAT WE CAN YOU

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:04.965
KNOW USE THAT TO MAKE A CHEAP

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:06.900
AND RENEWABLE HYDROGEN FUEL.

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:08.535
THE OTHER ITEM I'D THAT IS

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:09.903
WORTH CONSIDERING IN THIS IS

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:11.071
MORE RELATED TO THE AIR BE

01:40:11.138 --> 01:40:13.340
SCOPING PLAN AND THAT IS-

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:15.109
UTILIZING THE CAPACITY CREDIT

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:16.410
UNDER THE LOW CARBON FUEL

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:18.479
STANDARD FOR HEAVY DUTY FUELING

01:40:18.545 --> 01:40:20.647
INFRASTRUCTURE ASWELL IN

01:40:20.714 --> 01:40:21.281
TWENTY NINETEEN THAT CHANGE WAS

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:22.850
ONLY MADE FOR LIGHT DUTY. AND

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:23.884
JUST ONE OBSERVATION THAT I

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:25.486
WANT TO MAKE THAT I THINK IS

01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:26.553
TENDS TO GET LOST IN THESE

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.555
CONVERSATIONS IS SORT OF A

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.290
SCHISM BETWEEN LIGHT DUTY AND

01:40:30.357 --> 01:40:31.125
HEAVY DUTY THAT DOESN'T

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:34.194
ACTUALLY EXIST- IN TERMS OF THE

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:35.262
WAY THAT THE MARKET ACTUALLY

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:38.165
OPERATES. TODAY BY MEDIUM DUTY

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:40.267
VEHICLES UP TO CLASSICS WILL BE

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:41.402
UTILIZING LIGHT DUTY

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:42.936
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO WHEN WE

01:40:43.003 --> 01:40:44.571
TALK AS A BODY ABOUT NEEDING

01:40:44.638 --> 01:40:47.107
TO. DECARBONIZE TRANSPORTATION

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:48.175
AND ARE MOST AFFECTED

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:49.877
COMMUNITIES AND LAST MILE

01:40:49.943 --> 01:40:51.612
DELIVERY TRUCKS BEING SORT OF A

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:53.714
PERPETRATOR OF THOSE EMISSIONS

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:54.748
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HYDROGEN

01:40:54.815 --> 01:40:55.983
FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE NOT ONLY

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:57.384

CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION-

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:07.721
I'LL TOUCH ON JUST ANOTHER

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:08.989
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:10.424
CONVERSATION AGAIN ALL THE

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:12.125

PANELISTS THAT SPOKE TODAY JUST

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:24.271
THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEING DONE

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:26.340
IS GREAT- BUT I DO WANT TO

01:42:26.406 --> 01:42:28.308
TOUCH ON ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:29.076
THAT I THINK IS REALLY

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:31.912
IMPORTANT TO REIN IN IS THAT

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.914
46% OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN

01:42:33.981 --> 01:42:35.215
MULTI UNIT HOUSING AND DON'T

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:37.451
HAVE ACCESS TO CHARGING A LOT

01:42:37.518 --> 01:42:38.719
OF THE TIMES AND WE'RE GONNA BE

01:42:38.785 --> 01:42:40.387
REACHING THIS. MILESTONE THAT

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:41.622
GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAD PUT FORWARD

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:43.824
TO DO 1100% ZERO MISSION SALES

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:45.759
BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE YOU

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:46.426
REALLY DO NEED TO HAVE A LOT OF

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:48.195
OPTIONS THAT WORK FOR EVERYONE

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:49.596
AND SO THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:51.398
ELECTRIC VEHICLES REALLY DON'T

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:52.366
REQUIRE PARKING FOR A LONG

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:54.034
PERIOD OF TIME TO REFILL

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:55.969
THEMSELVES IT'S JUST. AT A GAS

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:56.904
STATION THAT YOU WOULD GO TO

01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:58.605
AND FILL IT UP YOURSELF I KNOW

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.307
THIS BECAUSE I HAVE THE HONDA

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:01.708
CLARITY RIGHT NOW AND IT'S

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.777
ABOUT FIVE TO SIX MINUTES MAX A

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:05.512
REVEALING TIME AND IS EXTREMELY

01:43:05.579 --> 01:43:06.780
CONVENIENT FOR ME AND I'M NOT

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.715
EVEN A PARENT SO I CAN IMAGINE

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:09.883
BEING A PARENT OR HAVING TWO

01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:11.251
JOBS HAVING TO GET FROM ONE

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:12.986
PLACE TO ANOTHER. I WOULD LOVE

01:43:13.053 --> 01:43:14.321
TO HAVE GOOD OPTIONS FOR ALL

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:15.656
CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.190
UTILIZE THE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC

01:43:17.257 --> 01:43:18.158
VEHICLES I KNOW THIS IS

01:43:18.225 --> 01:43:19.393
SPECIFICALLY A LIGHT DUTY

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:20.394
CONVERSATION THAT I'M HAVING

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.795
RIGHT NOW BUT I REALLY DO THINK

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:23.430
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE

01:43:23.497 --> 01:43:24.431
NEED TO HAVE OPTIONS FOR

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.767
CALIFORNIANS WHEN YOU KNOW 41%

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.435
OF OUR GHG EMISSIONS ARE DUE TO

01:43:28.502 --> 01:43:30.137
TRANSPORTATION. SO I WANT TO

01:43:30.203 --> 01:43:31.371
HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFITS OF THE

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:33.173
FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.841
THAT YOU CAN REVEAL SO QUICKLY

01:43:34.908 --> 01:43:35.742
AND THAT IT COULD BE VERY

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:37.511
ACCESSIBLE BUT WE REALLY DO

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:38.979
NEED THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:40.847
WAS TALKED ABOUT SO MUCH TODAY

01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:42.349
IN ORDER TO ENABLE SO MANY OF

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:44.284
THE CALIFORNIANS TO REFUEL

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:47.788
THEIR ONLY THREE STATIONS. AND

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:48.388
SACRAMENTO RIGHT NOW AND SO I

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:48.989
DO TO PLAN OUT MY ROW. AND I

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:50.190
HAVE TO MAKE SURE I CAN. MAKE

01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:51.858
IT TO AND FROM. I'D LIKE TO SEE

01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:52.960
A LOT MORE OF MY NEIGHBORS

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:54.861
BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT ACCESS-

01:43:54.928 --> 01:43:56.296
AND MEET THAT GOAL SO WE COULD

01:43:56.363 --> 01:43:58.031
HAVE ALL TYPES OF VEHICLES. TO

01:43:58.098 --> 01:43:59.900
ASSIST US IN REACHING OUR GHG

01:43:59.967 --> 01:44:01.535
EMISSIONS GOALS. SO THANK YOU

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:02.769

REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO

01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:06.607
ENGAGING. ALL THE OTHER TOPICS

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:08.809
THAT HYDROGEN CAN ASSIST WITH-

01:44:08.875 --> 01:44:10.477
IN THE OTHER SECTORS TO

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:11.411

VERY WELL I WANT TO FOCUS ON

SOMETHING VERY PARTICULAR TO

01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:32.833
CALIFORNIA AND A LEADER

01:44:32.899 --> 01:44:34.935
POSITION WE BUILT. THE ZERO

01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:38.405
EMISSION. MOSHE MOVEMENT I

01:44:38.472 --> 01:44:39.506
REALLY STARTED HERE IN

01:44:39.573 --> 01:44:41.108
CALIFORNIA OVER THIRTY YEARS

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:43.210
AGO IT DOES HAVE REGULATION IT

01:44:43.276 --> 01:44:45.012
IS IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY

01:44:45.078 --> 01:44:46.480
SUCCESSFUL NOT ONLY HERE IN

01:44:46.546 --> 01:44:48.649
CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THE WORLD

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:51.051
SETTING THAT TONE AND THIS IS A

01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:53.820
HUGE MOMENT FOR US ALL AS WE

01:44:53.887 --> 01:44:55.455
REALLY SEE THE SUCCESS OF BOTH

01:44:55.522 --> 01:44:56.456
BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS GOING

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:58.458
FORWARD BOTH CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:44:58.525 --> 01:44:59.526
EVERYTHING ELSE HAPPENING WE

01:44:59.593 --> 01:45:01.128
SEE THAT URGENCY WE'RE NOT

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:03.030
DOING ENOUGH WE NEED MORE OF

01:45:03.096 --> 01:45:04.598
THIS ON THE GROUND. SOMETHING

01:45:04.665 --> 01:45:06.266
THAT WAS BARELY TOUCHED UPON

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:10.437
EARLIER- DR MARTINEZ FROM CARB

01:45:10.504 --> 01:45:10.904
TALKED ABOUT THE SELF

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:12.839
SUFFICIENCY STUDY. WE NEED TO

01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:14.541
MOVE AWAY FROM SUBSIDIZING

01:45:14.608 --> 01:45:16.176
THESE MARKETS FOR EVER AND

01:45:16.243 --> 01:45:18.145
BUILDING THEM INTO SUSTAINABLE

01:45:18.211 --> 01:45:20.547
SUPPLY AND DEMAND MARKETS. THAT

LINES FOR OUR SAFETY. DUE TO

01:53:00.373 --> 01:53:02.075
THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE. IN

01:53:02.142 --> 01:53:03.776
HYDROGEN PROVIDE US WAY I'LL

01:53:03.843 --> 01:53:06.479
HAVE ENERGY LETTER NOT

01:53:06.546 --> 01:53:08.681
DEPENDENT ON OUR ELECTRIC

01:53:08.748 --> 01:53:09.215
TRANSMISSION TRANSMISSION

01:53:09.282 --> 01:53:13.319
SYSTEM SO IN CONTRAST A BATTERY

01:53:13.386 --> 01:53:16.055
THANKS RADIO CALL- WORLD WITH

01:53:16.122 --> 01:53:19.192
REQUIRE A VERY STRONG EMPHASIS

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:21.594
ON THE- LECTER TRANSMISSION

01:53:21.661 --> 01:53:26.032
SYSTEM. AND WERE REALLY JUST

01:53:26.099 --> 01:53:26.766
NOT THERE YET. WILL NOT BEING

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:30.637
ABLE TO- HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:31.804
WHETHER A GREEN HYDROGEN

01:53:31.871 --> 01:53:34.174
ECONOMY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.775
IN TERMS OF OUR OUR CLIMATE

01:53:35.842 --> 01:53:37.243
ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:39.279
REMEMBER A LOT OF TIMES SPOKE

01:53:39.345 --> 01:53:40.280
LIKE TO CHARGE BATTERIES AT

01:53:40.346 --> 01:53:41.814
NIGHT. AND NOT FOR THE

01:53:41.881 --> 01:53:43.082
CONVENIENCE BECAUSE LONG CHARGE

01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:46.452
TIME- BY THE WAY THE SUN IS

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:47.387
DOWN. SO THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:49.222
ISSUE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

01:53:49.289 --> 01:53:51.224
BATTERY CENTRIC SOLUTION TRULY

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:54.460
BECOME. A CLEAN ENERGY

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:56.763
INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM SO. THE

01:53:56.829 --> 01:53:58.698
OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO. KNOW

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:00.200
IS THAT WE HAD EXCELLENT

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:02.402
STRIDE. A QUICK MATH FOR

01:54:02.468 --> 01:54:04.771
HYDROGEN IN THE ROLLOUT OF THE

01:54:04.837 --> 01:54:06.973
HYDROGEN GAS STATIONS. AS WELL

01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.274
AS THE VEHICLES WHICH ARE

01:54:08.341 --> 01:54:11.211
COMPLETELY HI NOMINAL. SO OUR

01:54:11.277 --> 01:54:12.845
EMPHASIS THIS EVEN DATES BACK

01:54:12.912 --> 01:54:14.781
TO THE DELETE PROGRAMS GOING

01:54:14.847 --> 01:54:16.115
BACK INTO THE EIGHTIES AND

01:54:16.182 --> 01:54:16.983
NINETIES AND EARLY TWO

01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:19.452
THOUSAND. THE EMPHASIS WAS

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:21.187
ALWAYS ON THE DEMAND SIDE AND

01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:22.722
WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:26.192
EMPHASIS FOR- IN. STRONG

01:54:26.259 --> 01:54:28.127
SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR REGULATIONS

01:54:28.194 --> 01:54:29.729
AND INCENTIVES FOR THE

01:54:29.796 --> 01:54:31.431
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUPPLY SIDE

01:54:31.497 --> 01:54:33.032
SO THAT'S WHERE GREEN GREEN

01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:35.568
CONSTRUCTING. IT ON SOLVING THE

01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:37.804
RENEWABLE HYDROGEN SUPPLY SIDE

01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:39.005
ISSUES WE HAVE PATENTED

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:42.408
SOLUTIONS. THAT WILL REALLY.

01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:44.777
REDUCE THE COST FOR DELIVERED
