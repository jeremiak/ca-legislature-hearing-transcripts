QUESTIONS.

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:53.227
THE ONLY QUESTION I HAD IS

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.929
WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.664

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:58.800

01:29:00.068 --> 01:29:01.335
JUST SO THAT YOU'RE NOT HAVING

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:02.970
TO THE AYE AYE I UNDERSTAND ONE

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:05.239
OF THE CRITICISMS WAS --

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:07.475
GETTING HAVING READ THE REFUNDS

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:08.976
AND HOW THAT WOULD IT'S A

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:10.311
PROCEDURAL ISSUE MORE THAN

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:11.612
ANYTHING IT'S NOT.

01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:13.381
DOESN'T AFFECT THAT THAT THE

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:14.849
BILL I THINK IT'S A I THINK IT'S

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:15.883
REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN THE

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:16.951
INDUSTRY COMES FORWARD AND SAYS

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.720
LOOK WE'RE WILLING TO PAY --

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.521
A BUCKHEAD AND IN ORDER TO GET

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:22.356
THIS KIND OF WORK DONE I REALLY

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:22.957
APPRECIATED AND THAT'S VERY

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:24.258
POWERFUL --

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:25.226
I'M JUST WONDERING IF

01:29:25.293 --> 01:29:28.996
PROCEDURALLY THERE'S A DO YOU.

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:31.032
TO DECIDE HOWEVER IT IS THAT.

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:33.968
MECHANICALLY IT WOULD WORK.

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:35.336
THERE WAS JUST AN OBJECTION AND

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:36.003
I WONDERED IF THERE WAS A BETTER

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.838
WAY TO DO IT.

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:38.406
NOT ABSOLUTELY IT'S IT'S AN ITEM

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:39.707

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:41.142
MADAM CHAIR IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:42.410
QUITE A BIT --

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:43.511
IN THIS IS AN ITEM THAT

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:45.780
DIGESTION FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:48.282

WE BELIEVE.

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:52.386
THAT THIS IS THE BEST OPTION.

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.188

THAT HAS A REFUND --

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.338

FROM THE CATTLE COUNCIL RATHER

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:09.964
THAN COMING FROM A PRIVATE

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:12.300

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:31.586
