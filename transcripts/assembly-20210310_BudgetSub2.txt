PROGRAMS- BACK AT AT THE END DRIVING AND MAKE SURE WE- SUPPORT THEM THE BEST WE CAN HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE CRUX OF TODAY'S HEARING- WE WILL HAVE AS USUAL LIKE SOCIALLY. DISTANT PHYSICALLY DISTANCE HEARING LIMITED SEATING LIMITED OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE HEARING BUT THERE WILL BE CHANCES TO PARTICIPATE- ON THE TOLL FREE NUMER LATER IN THE HEARING. TODAY WE WILL FOCUS ON OF COURSE- WILL BEEN FOLKS DOING WITH THE STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGET RELATED TO RELIEF TO OUR CHILD CARE NETWORK IN CALIFORNIA. OF COURSE YOU HAD- THREE SEGMENTS OF A FEDERAL ARE THAT DOLLARS COMING IN AS WELL AS THE STATE BUDGET THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS YEAR- AS WE KNOW TO THE GOVERNOR TO FINISH HIS MASTER PLAN EARLY EDUCATION IN DECEMBER WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND- REALLY ASK THE- THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS HOW DO WE SUPPORT. AND STABILIZE OUR EASY CHILD CARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA HOW DO WE SUPPORT THE SENSOR WORKERS AND WHAT'S NEEDED TO BE DONE NOW TO BUILD UPON OUR EASY. SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT. WE WILL BEGIN WE HAVE AN OPENING COMMENTS I WILL NOTE THAT MY FELLOW CA AND COMMITTEE MEMBER WHO'S ALWAYS HERE ON TIME AND ALWAYS STAYS TILL THE END- WHEN SHE STARTED SHE TALKED ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE IN EARLY EDUCATION YOUR PASSION SO YEAH LETS YOU SEE IF YOU WERE IS THE BEGINNING AS WELL. YEAH I AM THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THAT- EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION- IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO ME I HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER- AND CALIFORNIA GIVING ACCESS TO OUR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS TO A QUALITY LEARNING EXPERIENCES VITAL ON MY SEAT IN MY OWN DAUGHTER BUT I'VE ALSO SEEN AND MY WORK AS A CHILD CARE PROVIDER AND AN ADVOCATE FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. I'M EXCITED THAT THE GOVERNOR THAT THE STATE IS TAKING SERIOUS ACTION AROUND DEVELOPING A PLAN TO EDUCATE OUR LITTLEST LEARNERS AS I LIKE TO CALL THEM- AND REALLY SAID ABOUT THE CONVERSATION AND ABOUT THE PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW MY PERSPECTIVE COMES FROM NOT OF A NONPROFIT- PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE PROVIDER AND THIS IS A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM ARE EASY COMMUNITY AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL ALL ANGLES AND SUPPORTING THE SYSTEM AS IT IS WHILE EXPANDING- FOR OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU AND I KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE A GREAT ADDITION NOT JUST BECAUSE YOUR PASSION BUT YOU KNOW THESE ISSUES FIRST HAND HAVING A STATE CONTRACT FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AS A WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN NOW WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE. WHICH IS- AN OPPORTUNIST CAST THE GOVERNOR'S CALIFORNIA MASTER PLANNED FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE WE HAVE A CHRIS PERRY WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO NOW QUEBEC WITH WEST AT WHO HELPED CRAFT THE REPORT AND. SARAH CORTEZ WITH THE L. A. L. I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO. WITH CHRIS. AT CORRECT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY TO PRESENT THE HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW THE MASTER PLANNED FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE. THE MANDATE FOR THE MASTER PLAN WAS TO BUILD ON THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE VARIOUS OTHER STATE CHILD CARE POLICY ASSETS TO CREATE A CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE ROADMAP FOR THE STATE'S EARLY CARE AND LEARNING SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW SHORTLY AFTER THE LAUNCH OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE EFFORT THAT KOBE NINETEEN AND THERE MIGHT BE YEAH. AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THE TREMENDOUS RESILIENCE OF PARENTS AND CHILDREN PROVIDERS AS WELL AS THE INCREASED FRAGILITY OF THE EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM SO AS WE WORK TO BRING THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE MASTER PLAN INTO REALITY I LIKE TO START BY SHARING THE VISION OF- SECRETARY. DOLLY WHO- REALLY ONE US TO NOT ONLY MEET THE FOUR KEY OBJECTIVES OF THE MASTER PLAN SUCH AS IMPROVING LIFE OUTCOMES AND MAKING CARE OPTIONS MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND PROMOTING SCHOOL READINESS. AND SUPPORTING THE WORK FORCE THAT HE ALWAYS HE ALSO HOPE THAT WE WOULD BRING THOSE KEY PILLARS TOGETHER AND CREATE AN ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE EARLY LEARNING SYSTEM THAT. COULD BRING BIG ECONOMIC RETURNS AS WELL AS- SOCIAL OR HELP IN EDUCATION RETURNS TO ITS STATE. AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO YOU KNOW WHO WOULD HAVE TO WALK. YOU THROUGH THE SPECIFICS OF THE PLAN. THANKS CHRIS WE HAVE SOME SLIDES AND I'M GOING TO START SHARING RIGHT NOW. IN ITS SECOND HERE- AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY ON THIS TOPIC- YOU CAN SEE THAT NOW BRIAN IS CHRIS SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN- QUITE UNDERTAKING AND ONE THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FROM. SECRETARY DOLLY- HIS TEAM HAD TO HELP HIM IN SERVICES- AND WHATEVER CREATED THE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT THAT CHRIS HAS PROVIDED US DROUGHT DOES WORK- YOU HAVING YOUR- MATERIALS FOR TODAY- ALREADY ON THE AGENDA- AND NOW LINE OF YOU KNOW REALLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT GETTING CALIFORNIA TOOK PLACE WHERE- WE ARE DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL KIDS OF MANY OF THE OBJECTIVES OUTLINED IN. THE ASSEMBLY WILL BRING COMMISSION- WERE WERE CALLED OUT AND AMPLIFIED ORGANIZE YOUR SUPPORT IN CREATING AN ACTION PLAN THAT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE WE CAN PROVIDE FOR COMPREHENSIVE CARE- FOR INTO THE TODDLERS ENSURING THAT FAMILIES CAN EASILY IDENTIFY ACCESS AND CHOOSE CARE THAT MEETS OUR NEEDS ARE VOTING SCHOOL READINESS- UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND GROWING OUR WORKFORCE AND STATE WHERE THEY WORK FOR SOME. I THINK THIS YEAR PARTICULAR THIS PAST YEAR IN PARTICULAR HAS SHOWN US JUST HOW IMPORTANT EARLY CHILD- CARE AND LEARNING IS HOW FRAGILE IT IS AS WE LOOK AT THE IMPACT THE COMPANIES HAD UPON FAMILIES OUR WORK FORCE AND THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN SO THIS IS THIS PLAN IS- IN TOTAL A WAY TO LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO DO OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS IN TERMS OF ACTIONS. THAT REALLY DELIVER ON- ADDRESSING THE NEEDS THAT WE SEE AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER BUILDING ON THE GREAT WORK THAT WAS- SPEARHEADED BY THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION BUT ALSO YOU KNOW THE REPEATED THEMES THAT WE SAW FROM THE LIFTING CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE- THE RATE REFORM WORK GROUP THAT CALIFORNIA'S TRANSFORMING THE WORKFORCE FOR- WORKGROUP SO THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD AN IMPORTANT AND-IN PROMOTING DRAWING ATTENTION TO. AN ORGANIZING- THAT HAVE COME. FORWARD IN THIS MASTER PLAN IN. ONE THING I WANNA HOW FOR YOU- THE MASTER PLAN IS. IT'S A GOOD. THAT CAN BE FOR IN WE'VE WE HAVE MADE UP OR AVAILABLE WHICH IS. I THINK YOU KNOW HAS A- MY NUMBER PAGES- BUT WE'VE FOR AND- THAT WE HAD TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN UNDERSTANDING THE ISSUES- AND THAT. WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE STORIES OF FAMILIES CHILDREN PROVIDERS CAREGIVERS TEACHERS IN THE SPACE SO WE HAVE MADE AVAILABLE. THE MASTER PLAN REPORT A SUMMARY IT'S IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES THE SUMMARY IS AND- VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND- I HAVE A WEBSITE THAT HAS BOTH VIDEO BECAUSE IT HAS. A WAY THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN ENGAGE WITH THE INFORMATION- OF THE MASTER PLAN WE'VE HAD OVER SIXTY THREE HUNDRED UNIQUE VISITORS TO THE SITE- WE'VE HAD OVER. TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PAGES SO IT'S A GOOD TIME PEOPLE ARE ENGAGING WITH THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN THE MASTER PLANNING WERE SEEN AS HEAVILY CONSTRAINED CALIFORNIA BUT WE ALSO HAVE. PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES OTHER COUNTRIES LOOKING AT WHAT CALIFORNIA IS DOING IN THIS AREA. AS CAPTURED IN THE MASTER PLAN. SO IN YOUR AGENDA ITEM ALL IT OUTLINES THE VARIOUS GOALS AND HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGIES. THAT ARE KEY TO THE MASTER PLAN SO WE HAVE ORGANIZED THE MASTER PLAN AROUND FOUR KEY GOALS. ON A YOU CAN SEE THEM HERE ON THE SITE- ONE IS HAVING PROGRAMS THAT ARE ARE. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN THINKING ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE NOT JUST EXISTING BUT HOW THEY'RE UNIFIED HOW THE STRENGTHENED AND HOW THEIR SUPPORT OF COLLECTIVELY. OF OUR CHILDREN'S LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT AND THEN ULTIMATELY YOU COULD HAVE PROGRAMS BUT WE CAN'T DELIVER PROGRAMS WITHOUT. THE WORK FORCE THAT'S AVAILABLE AND NEED TO SEE OUR WORKFORCE- BOTH SUPPORTED DEVELOPED. AND INCENTIVIZE ALONG THE KIND OF CAREER PATHWAYS THAT WE WANT TO SEE THAT BUILDS FOR OF QUALITY THAT BUILD FOR. WHAT WE KNOW RESEARCH SIZE MATTERS TO YOUNG CHILDREN- AND IS SUPPORTED THEN BY SOME COHERENCE IN THE WAY THAT WE IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE PROGRAMMATIC WORK STANDARDS WORKFORCE. OUR STANDARDS ARE I'M- THE NEXT AREAS FUNDING IN THIS IS ONE THAT WE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT AS WE ARE COMING INTO THIS WORK. AS WE ARE WORKING THROUGH DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S FINE WHICH IS YOU DON'T GET VERY FAR WITH PROGRAMS THAT WORK FORCE IF WE CAN'T PUT TOGETHER. A LOGICAL. WAY OF THINKING THROUGH HOW TO BRING TOGETHER FINDING HOW TO THINK ABOUT FINDING AS IT. NEEDS TO BE INCREASED AND BUILDING THAT AROUND THAT THE KINDS OF THINGS WE WANT TO SEE WITH THAT. THE RIGHT PROGRAMS- PUTTING THEM THE RESOURCES THAT THAT'LL ULTIMATELY BUILDS ITS WORKFORCE- THAT WE WANT TO SEE AND THEN FINALLY OPERATIONS- THINKING ABOUT GOVERNANCE ADMINISTRATION. HOW DO WE STREAMLINED THE SYSTEM SO THAT IT'S FAMILY PARENTS CENTRIC CHILD FOCUSED- AND EASIER TO NAVIGATE SO THAT THOSE THINGS THAT WE SAY MATTER- WITH REGARD TO CREATING EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES. ARE QUITE ARE ARE MORE APPARENT OBVIOUS AND AVAILABLE. THE FAMILY SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR BROUGH AREAS I WILL JUST MAKE A HIGH OF EACH OF THESE SO YOU KNOW GOAL ONE B. PROGRAM. WE BEEN THERE- YOU KNOW BOTH RESEARCH A RECOMMEND THE- AROUND- UNIVERSAL- WE'VE LOOKED IN DEPTH AT PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND WHAT IT WILL MEAN THAT TAKE NUMBER CALIFORNIA'S PRESENTLY AND BUILDING THAT SYSTEM. OUT TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE FROM THE STATE AND THEN A KEY AREA AROUND ALCOHOL TREATMENT OF CHILDREN WHERE WE HAVE. PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW- ARE PRESENT AND NEEDED TO MAKE THAT MORE OF A STANDARD OF THE STATE WITH REGARD TO HOW WE SUPPORT BILL LANGUAGE LEARNERS JOIN WITH DISABILITIES- AND TAKING UP ARMS. YOU KNOW ADDRESSING OUR PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW. ARE VERY BARRIERS TO US ACHIEVING EQUITY SO ELIMINATION OF SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION- WORKING HARD TO SUPPORT INCLUSION AND THAT STARTS AT THE VERY BEGINNING- WHERE WE ARE FOCUSED ON INFANTILE THEIR CARE AND HOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUR WORKFORCE CAPACITY. AND PROVIDING MORE TARGETED ATTENTION TO HOW WE ADDRESS THAT AREA NEED FOR OUR STATE. FARM YOU KNOW WORKFORCE THIS IS THE SECOND GOAL- IS SO KEY TO THE SYSTEM WHICH IS. WE KNOW THAT WE CAN ONLY PROVIDE ACCESS IF WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE TO SUPPORT CHILDREN. AND HAVING THAT DONE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOR THE FULL RANGE OF. OF CARE GIVERS TEACHERS- THAT OUR PUBLIC ASSIST AND SO ONE WE'VE GOT IS THERE'S MANY. IN TYPES OF PRO WHICH OFTEN SEGMENTED CITING SEPARATE ON THE WORK FORCE AND SO ONE KEEP PROPOSAL THAT THE MASKED BY MAKES IS LET'S BUILD A WORKFORCE AROUND COMPETENCIES. SO THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE ARE WITH REGARD TO THE FUNDING THE PROGRAMS WE SEE PATHWAYS FOR THOSE- IN ROLES AS CAREGIVERS PROVIDERS TEACHERS. AND IN THOSE PATHWAYS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESEARCH AROUND WHAT WE SAY MATTERS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. IS CONNECTED TO WHAT WE THEN TRAINING AND SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE WITH AND SO USING- MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE CREATING THE FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING AROUND CHILD DEVELOPMENT. LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS- YOU KNOW FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND THE LIKE SO THAT WE CAN ADVANCE THESE COMPETENCIES AS PEOPLE PROGRESS BUT THAT WE HAVE THEM AS A FOUNDATION. AND THAT THAT PROGRESSION FOLLOWS A CAREER PATHWAY THAT'S- INCENTIVIZE SUPPORTED BY HOW WE FUND THE SYSTEM AND THAT WERE WORKING TO. BETTER STREAMLINE DIFFERENCES RIGHT REACHED C. OF PERCEIVED DIFFERENCES OF PROGRAMS AND MAKING THEM- CONNECTED OR SO WE CAN SUPPORT ALIGNMENT. FOR HOW OUR WORKFORCE WILL MOVE THROUGH AND ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND- KEEP PEACE FUNDING SO. THIS IS ONE THAT I KNOW- THIS COMMITTEE IS BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH- YOU KNOW AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT A QUESTION OF HOW DO YOU STRUCTURE. SO THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE MORE FUNDS TO PUT IT WE CAN SAY THAT WERE LOGICALLY ADDRESSING IT AND DINNER AND- CONNECTING TO THE THINGS THAT WE SAY WE VALUE IN THE SYSTEM SO. YOU KNOW WE HAVE- ONE KEY STRATEGY AROUND SLIDING SCALE FEES AND THAT IS IF WE CAN EXPAND WHERE WE PROVIDE SUBSIDIES SO THIS ISN'T ABOUT ASKING PARENTS TO PAY MORE IT'S ABOUT FINDING WAYS WHERE. WE CAN EXTEND SUBSIDIES WE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO HAVE A SLIDING SCALE SPEAK THAT THAT ALLOWS FOR- SOME RAMP DOWN. AND THEN WHAT THAT AND WE COME. LOOK LIKE AND THEY- IMPORTANTLY THE AT WAY WE HAVE OUR REMEMBER SO HAVE A RIGHT PROGRAM THEY HAVE STRUCK. WE'RE SAYING WE CAN THOSE CAN BE UNIFIED. AND IMPORTANT- ORGANIZED- AROUND ACOSTA A MODEL OF REIMBURSEMENT SO THIS WOULD BOTH SIMPLIFIED WITH AMPLIFIER VIEW ON EQUITY AND IT WOULD BRING ME INTO THE FORMULATIONS OF FOCUS ON WHAT CHILDREN NEED. AND ATTENTION TO QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF WHAT WE PROPOSED IS- HAVING A STRUCTURE THAT HAS BASE RATES WITH ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW MATTER- AND ARE CONNECTED VERY MUCH TO WHAT WE CALLED OUT FOR WORKFORCE AND PROGRAM. AND FINALLY THE LAST AREAS MAKING THE SYSTEM SO THAT IT IS- STREAMLINED THE FROM THE VIEW OF FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS MAKING IT SO THEY WERE ORGANIZED AROUND HOW WE- BEST SUPPORT AND USE DATA AND- INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN DRIVE TO WHERE WE SEE NEEDS. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE FACILITIES AND BUILDING FOR SOME TYPE OF SHARING. EFFICIENCY OF YOU KNOW HAVING- KICKING OUT THE BUSY WORKER PAPERWORK- AND MAKING THAT SOMETHING WE CAN STREAMLINE SO THAT WE CAN ADD TO EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION SO WE CAN FOCUS MORE OF THE SYSTEM ON. THE SUPPORTIVE. OF CARE GIVING AND LEARNING. AND THEN I'LL THIS CAN KERR. THIS WOULD BE YOU KNOW ANOTHER MAJOR PART OF THE MASTER PLAN WAS. LOOKING AT WILL WANT WHAT WHAT A SYSTEM LIKE THIS COST. INTO THAT'S YOUR PLAN INCLUDES AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT A COST MODEL FOR COST MODELING FOR VARIOUS POLICY SCENARIOS- FOR WHICH WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT DEPENDING ON THOSE POLICY CHOICES. IT WOULD COST AN ADDITIONAL TWO TO TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER TWELVE THE TEN YEARS THANK YOU I'M SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION A MASTER PLAN AND THAT RANGES LARGELY BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY IMPORTANT DECISIONS THAT WE NEED TO BE MADE WITH REGARD TO- WHERE DO YOU. ESTABLISH VARIOUS YOU KNOW METRICS ON QUALITY WHAT WE MEAN BY ACCESS AND SO- THAT DEBUTED THE RANGE HERE THOUGH BUILDS ON WHAT IS PRESENTLY ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN. PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND ANOTHER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN WHAT WE SEE AS PART OF FAMILY COST RIGHT NOW SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS. AT THE TOP END OF THIS PLANT I WAS DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL SPEND ON ON THE SYSTEM FOR WHICH WE THINK IT NEEDS YOU KNOW WE WOULD SEE A COMBINATION OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT BUSINESS CONTRIBUTIONS PHILANTHROPY. AND SOME- POTENTIAL FAMILY FEES FOR FAMILIES PARTICIPATING THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. THE EARLY CHILD CARE AND LEARNING OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE AND ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT WE THINK IS SUPER TIMELY ABOUT THIS PLAN IS IT ALIGNS STRONGLY. WITH WI FI THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION OR THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAVING SAID AS THEY WERE- YOU KNOW IT- OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY WERE OUTLINING WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO FOR ONLY CHILD. SO THIS REALLY PRESENTS CALIFORNIA AS A STATE WITH A SHOVEL READY PLAN WITH WHAT THE FOUNDATIONAL PIECES IN PLACE THAT THAT ARE PREPARED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA- FOR WHICH YOU KNOW WE ARE DEMONSTRATED IN READY PARTNER AS A STATE AND SO WITH THAT- ALL WRAP THIS UP AND- SEE WHAT QUESTIONS YOU HAVE BUT REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR- SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT. AREA AND FOR THE MASTER PLAN. OKAY THANK YOU L. A. M. CORTEZ WITH THE ANALYST. WELL MY FELLOW PANEL WERE. HE TO THE HAVE DROPPED THE MASS PLAN I THE PANEL TODAY AS WHO READ THE MASTER COME DOCUMENT AND IT'S A BRIEFINGS WELL THE LARGEST WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OF THE RESEARCH EFFORTS OF DRAFTING OF THE MASTER PLAN. THE LEGISLATURE WAS ABLE TO STOP THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS THROUGH THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL PROCESS. AND THE LEGISLATURE COULD EVALUATE WHETHER THE MASTERPLAN ANSWERING ALL THE STATUTORY OR QUESTIONS. OR OTHER QUESTIONS OF INTEREST PASSED. WE WOULD OVER THE CAN THAT THE- OF THE PLAN GLAZER SHE WAS PART OF AN TWENTIES BUDGET. IMPLEMENTING OF THEM OUT PLAN NOT YET BEEN AGREED BY THE LARGEST. DID PRESENT. THAT STEM FROM THE MASTER PLAN WORKS SUCH AS THE G. CARE EXPANSION PROPOSAL THE EDUCATION BUDGET COMMITTEE SUBCOMMITTEE RECENTLY HEARD. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE ACTIONS NINETEEN ALIGNMENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES WE WILL NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THE MASTERPLAN ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL THERE ARE A LOT OF OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS THE STATE WE NEED YOUR ADDRESS TO IMPLEMENT THE MASTER PLAN MOST NOTABLY THE FISCAL PICTURE. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. BUT I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ALL A SERIES OF BUT ALSO WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SELMER VITIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH- I AM EXCITED ABOUT THIS MASTER PLAN BUT I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO KNOW- HOW IT'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED- AND THEN GETTING INTO SOME OF THE DIDN'T MORE OF THE DETAILS AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I MAY HAVE MAY BE ANSWERED AND ISSUES ADDING FIVE AND SIX BUT I JUST WANNA SHOOT FOR FORT FOR THEM NOW SO DOES THE ADMINISTRATION ENVISIONED HE K. AS THE PRIMARY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS. TRANSITIONING OTHER STATE SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO PRIMARILY SERVE OUR YOUNGER CHILDREN. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS SERRA BURDEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HOPEFUL YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY- SO TO YOUR QUESTION THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE FUNDING FOR. INVESTMENTS IN THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES- IT INCLUDES VARIOUS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR WORKFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCENTIVE GRANTS I'M SO TO THAT END YES THE ADMINISTRATION IS REFLECTING ON THE RESEARCH IN THE MASTER PLAN THAT SHOWS THAT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IS A GREAT OPTION. TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE FOUR YEAR OLD TO CALIFORNIA. SO IS THIS EFFORT ALSO TO BALANCE THE DAHLE GOALS OF UNIVERSAL ACCESS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS AND PRIORITIZE ACCESS FOR ASK OUR RISK TO. ALL WITHIN THE T. K. PROGRAM- AND WHAT IS THE PHASING OUT OF STATE PRESCHOOL GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND IS THERE. ANY DISCUSSIONS OR ANY AND INFORMATION I HOP ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THEIR PRIVATE PROVIDERS AND NONPROFIT PROVIDERS AND INCLUDING THEM- IN IN THIS IN AND IN THIS PROCESS MOVING FORWARD. YES THERE ARE NONE AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO HOPEFULLY I CAN COVER ALL OF THOSE BUT WE ARE NOT PROPOSING ANY CHANGES TO THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AT THIS TIME- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM. IS VERY BENEFICIAL TO FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA- SO WE RECOGNIZED A NON PROFITS AND CEOS IN LEDS ALL PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN PROVIDING OUR SERVICES FOR CHILDREN SO. THERE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE ALIGNMENT- BETWEEN THE EXPANSION OF THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AS ITS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. I AS IT'S PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- IN WITH THE EXISTING PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. AND HOW MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING TO THE STATE RECEIVED TO SUPPORT THE PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT STRATEGIC PLAN REQUIREMENTS. AND ALSO OR ARE WE GOING ARE THERE ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING- HOW IS THE TAN F. BLOCK GRANT GOING TO BE UTILIZED OR- AND YET YOU LAST. HI THIS IS CHRIS BURY I CAN ANSWER THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION REGARDING PDG PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT- INDEED WE RECEIVED A PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT INITIAL- AND IT WAS FOR PROXIBID AND IN IN THAT. FUNDING WE WERE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE FIRST NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR CALIFORNIA THAT IS STILL A RESOURCE THAT'S BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO. THE PUBLIC- TO VIEW THE DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED AND CONTINUES TO BE UPDATED. IN THE PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT RENEWAL PDG ARE- WE ARE NOT DEDICATING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT BUT WE ARE USING THE ONE DONE DURING THE INITIAL GRANT. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. YEAH IT DOES THANK YOU. AND GOOD CAN ANYONE CAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SPEAK TO OR OR THE- WHOEVER MAY HAVE INFORMATION. BUT OUR TOWN F. BLOCK BLOCK GRANT AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE LIES IN THIS. MASTER PLAN. THIS IS SEVERED OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE ARE STILL USING TOWN OF FUNDS AND ARE POWERED STAGE TO- PROGRAM- SO WE- ARE STILL UTILIZING ON EIGHTY MILLION AND- TEN O'CLOCK AM FUNDS FOR. THAT CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT CHANGING AT THIS TIME- SO THAT SPEAKING TO HOW WE ARE CURRENTLY USING. YOU CURRENTLY UTILIZING THE TEN THE FUNDS FOR CHILD CARE AND WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE. THANK YOU AND- LASTLY IN THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS UNDER ITS- STRENGTH AND QUALITY STANDARDS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SO THAT THEY SERVE ALL CHILDREN. ARE WELL AND CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY RESPONSIVE SETTINGS WHAT IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOOK LIKE AT THE- END USER IN THIS WOULD THIS ALSO FALL UNDER. THE REAL NEED FOR PROVIDERS TO FIND ACCESS TO QUALITY SUBSTITUTES THAT'S ONE OF THE THIGS I HEAR MOST FROM PROVIDERS- DURING THIS PANDEMIC EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC IS WHY WHEN YOU- HAVE A TEACHER THAT IS SICK- FINDING A SUBSTITUTE IS DIFFICULT AND THIS PANDEMIC HAS MADE THAT AND EVEN. MORE IMPOSSIBLE REALLY AND PARTICULARLY THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR PROVIDERS THAT ARE SERVING OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES MINORITY STUDENTS- STUDENTS THAT ENGLISH IS THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE- SO WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOOK LIKE IN THIS COMPANY AND MY PUTTING. AND THE NEED FOR DEVELOPING THE WORK FORCE AND QUALITY SUBSTITUTES AND THAT'S RIGHT BUCK BUCKET. SO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE CARE TO GIVE EUROPE ONE REFERENCE FROM THE PLAN THAT I THINK IS RELEVANT TO THAT POINT WHICH IS- ONE ELEMENT IN IN. GOAL FOR AREA IS CALLING OUT- SOME VALUE BENEFITS AND SHARED SERVICES NETWORKS. AND B. WHAT A SHARED SERVICES THAT WE'RE GETTING WE'VE SEEN THIS- ON SOME SCALE BOTH WITHIN THE STATE WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES BUT ALSO ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE IT'S- TAKING- A ENTITY THAT OFFERS SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. FOR THINGS LIKE BUSINESS OPERATIONS BUT JUST AS YOU SAID COULD BE. A WAY TO GET SUBSTITUTES AVAILABLE TO OUR FIELD SO THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN PROFESSIONAL OR YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE SERVICES IF A CAREGIVER IS UNAVAILABLE OR EDUCATORS ON AVAILABLE SO WE HAVE PUT FORTH THAT WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME STRUCTURES LIKE YOU'RE SAYING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IT COULD OCCUR THROUGH THESE ENTITIES. I NEED TO BE ORGANIZED WE HAVE A VERY BIG STATE WITH LOTS PROVIDERS SO HAVING SOME WAY TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO ALL INCLUDING FAMILY CHILD CARE INCLUDING OUR CENTER BASED CARE INCLUDING- THOSE EXISTED SCHOOL DISTRICT SO. WHY FORM. HAVING AND THAT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR SUPPORT I'M ANOTHER COULD BE- WE'VE CALLED OUT- THERE ARE AREAS WHEN WE CALL WE SAY YOU KNOW LET'S WORK ON IT- SUSPENSIONS EXPULSIONS AND THEIR ELIMINATION LET'S WORK ON- REDUCING OUR BRINGING FORWARD SUPPORT FOR TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICE STILL LANGUAGE LEARNERS THOSE ARE ALL AREAS WHERE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS COULD TAKE THE FORM OF BOTH WHAT IS TRAINED FOR IT COULD ALSO TAKE THE FORM OF WHAT IS IN TERMS OF SPECIALIZED SUPPORT TO DEAL WITH. YOU KNOW ISSUES THAT THEY MAY HAVE PRESENT THEMSELVES- IN CLASSROOMS IN HOMES WHERE CARE IS BEING GIVEN SO A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN INTERPRET HOW TO THINK ABOUT TECHNICAL SYSTEMS BUT WE SEE THAT WORKS BEING ONE PART AND WE SEE THESE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS- HOW DO WE GET SOME SPECIALIZED. SUPPORT AVAILABLE TO THE FIELD. AND WHAT. MASTERPLAN RECOMMENDATIONS- ARE THERE TO IT STABILIZE CHILD CARE- ESPECIALLY IN THE NEAR TERM AS YOU KNOW THIS I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS A MASTER PLAN. UPON ITS INCEPTION DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WOULD BE FACING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT WOULD TURN YOU KNOW THE PRESCHOOL AND CHILD CARE INDUSTRY UPSIDE DOWN SO I'M JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TO HELP STABILIZE NOW. SO I WILL CALL OUT ONE MAJOR ONE WHICH IS DATA- THERE THERE IS YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THIS ACTUALLY TO GO TO FACT- ALREADY WHICH IS HAVING DATA SO WE KNOW. WHERE CARE IS AVAILABLE GETTING THAT INFORMATION TO PARENTS BUT ALSO HAVING DATA SO WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AND TO BE ABLE TO COORDINATE SERVICES- WHERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT THAT I THINK IS ONE THING IN THE NEAR TERM THAT AGAIN HAS HAD SOME VALUE IMMEDIATELY BUT IS ONE THING THAT IS BEING. WORKED ODD PRESENTLY AND WILL HELP WITH- RECOVERY EFFORTS AS WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT- THE EFFECTS OF COBIT I THINK THERE'S ALSO PIECES IN THERE THAT ARE THERE WITH REGARD TO OUR WORKFORCE NEEDS- AND BEING ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES WITH REGARD TO HOW WE FIND THE HOW WE TRAIN- BECAUSE NOT ONLY. WERE NOW IN A PLACE WHERE WE ALREADY KNEW WE HAD A NEED FOR MORE. ON THE WORK FORCE. BUT WE NOW NEED TO. EVEN BE ABLE A LOSS OF- THE WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED TO QUICKLY- YOU KNOW. WORK TO TRAIN PEOPLE AND OR BRING PEOPLE BACK INTO. AND ALL THIS NOTE THAT I DID RECOGNIZE- YOU KNOW MIGHT THE PRESCHOOL THAT THAT IRAN AND CHILD CARE CENTER THAT IRAN- BEFORE THE PANDEMIC EVENT DURING THE PANDEMIC IT THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS WERE REALLY HARD- AND I DID NOTICE AND RECOGNIZE HOW QUICKLY OUR CCRC. REPRESENTATIVES GOT ON THE PHONE WITH US TO ASK US YOU KNOW HOW MANY KIDS WE HAD FAMILIES LOTS WE HAD OPENED COULD THEY PLACE. THE CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN OUR PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT THAT DATA COLLECTION THOSE QUESTIONS THAT ON THE GROUND RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR AGENCIES IS REALLY VITAL AND I APPRECIATE THEIR WORK. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU GREAT QUESTION SOUGHT SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. OF COURSE THAT THE MASTER PLAN IS MUCH MORE THAN. THAN TEEKAY BUT I DID WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THAT SHE REFUSED TO ANSWER BECAUSE- THAT THE SHE REFUSED TO BUT- APARTMENT A FINANCE THEY HAVE A JOB TO DO AND SO DO WE- BUT- YEAH WE THINK LOUD AND CLEAR. AS WE TRANSITION. TO UNIVERSAL TKA AND HAVE THAT L. A. BASIN PROP NINETY EIGHT EIGHT BASED- THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BOOST. THAT ZERO THREE THREE. BOTH KIDS AND FAMILIES BUT ALSO PROVIDERS IN OTHER WORDS ARE. IT WE HAVE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE CURRENTLY SPEND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AS THE AGENDA SAYS. YOU KNOW ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIXTY SOMETHING THOUSAND IT WENT DOWN DURING THE- DURING OCTOBER NINETEEN DURING FOR FULL DAY APART DAY. AND SO WITH THOSE MONIES NO LONGER NEEDED WITH THOSE KIDS NTK YOU KNOW. SOME PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A GREAT GIVE IT TO US TO EXPAND MONEY FOR. I HSS THAT THE YOU KNOW HEALTH CARE HIGHER AT OTHER WERE THE WERE LIKE NOT ON. THIS MONEY WAS FOR. AS LITTLE OUR LITTLEST LEARNERS AS YOU SAID AND IT SHOULD STAY FOR OUR LITTLEST LEARNERS SO- THIS IS NOT THE POLICY COMMITTEE. BUT WE HAVE A TWO BILLS GOING TO THE PROCESS ARE BILL THAT I KNOW YOU'RE PARTNERS WITH ME ON. ON ON- PHASING IN UNIVERSAL T. K. BUT A BILL BY CERTAINLY MOUNT IN THE SENATE. WHICH STATES THAT YOU DO HAVE THAT TRANSITION. THOSE MONIES THAT USED TO GO. FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SHOULDN'T GO TO THE BLACK HOLE OF THE STATE BUDGET. WE SHOULD BE REDIRECTED. TO PROP UP ACCESS FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS ALL THE WAY UP TO THREE YEAR OLDS IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM-MAKE THE MORE VIABLE AS WELL AS YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE. KIDS ARE NTK AND MAYBE THEY'D MAKE IF IT'S A- EVEN BEST CASE SCENARIO OF TEEKAY IF IT'S A FULL DAY WE DO KNOW IT'S NOT A REAL FULL DAY. YOU KNOW PARENTS YOU KNOW. FOUR FIVE HOURS HAVE TO GO PICK UP THE CAN THE DAVIS THAT DOESN'T WORK- SO HAVE YOU KNOW AFTER. A RAP AS WELL SO THAT CERTAINLY IS OUR NOTION AND- ANOTHER GIG THE PART OF FINANCED IN COMMITTED AS AS WELL BUT WE'RE TALKING TO THEM AND- AND THEY HI I THINK. A SUPPORT THE DIRECTION THAT THEY WERE HEADED. BUT I WANT TO ASK A FEW MORE STEPS ABOUT THIS. OUT A ONE I I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THAT THE BITE IN- THAT KIND OF VISION WHAT THE BUT THE BUYING TEAM- CAMPAIGN DONNA'S TALKED ABOUT THE GATE. AT A GIONALE OR CHRIS DO WE HAVE ANY INDICATION THAT THAT THEY'LL BE RESOURCES TO HELP US IMPLEMENT. OUR LOFTY GOALS WHETHER IT'S- PROVIDING INCREASED ACCESS OR- YOU KNOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT YOU KNOW PAY THE PROVIDERS. WHAT THEY NEED MAKE SURE WE DON'T PAY THAT. WORKERS POVERTY WAGES AS WELL- I'LL I'LL- THE ANSWER. OR TO JIM NOW. I THINK WE'RE IN A GOOD POSITIONING CALIFORNIA IF THE PRESIDENT SIGNS THE CURRENT LEGISLATION WORKS SLATED TO RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT SVEN BILLION DOLLARS. THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THREE SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND YES IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE A PLAN AS A ROADMAP FOR HOW WE MIGHT MAKE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT- WHERE TO EXPAND HOW TO EXPAND. WHAT WHAT. THE RATE DISCUSSION WE KNOW IT'S HAPPENING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT THE SAME TIME. THAT IN ADDITION TO THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION REPORT WE HAVE. A MASTER PLAN WE CAN. REALLY RELY ON THOSE DOCUMENTS TO MAKE THOSE CRITICAL DECISIONS. JANELLE DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK MORE SPECIFICALLY TO- WHETHER THEY'RE TO BE IT I DON'T THINK THAT THE LEGISLATION IS. TERRIBLY SPECIFIC ABOUT- INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE OF CHILD CARE- BUT THAT MAY COME INTO SHARPER FOCUS IN THE COMING WEEKS. YEAH I WOULD SAY I'M I'M WITH CHRIS THAT I THINK IT'S- WE DON'T HAVE PROPOSALS YET THAT WOULD SAY HERE'S WHAT'S GOING INTO THE FEDERAL BUDGET BECAUSE I THINK SO MUCH ATTENTION HAD TO QUIT ON THE COVERAGE- RELIEF. BILL WHICH YOU KNOW BY NOW THAT THAT HAS PASSED THROUGH AND HOPEFULLY. ABOUT WHERE TO GO AND I THINK THAT- THE MASTER PLAN BECAUSE OF THAT OF MY MAKE PRESENTS A VERY GOOD CASE OF THOSE THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SAID IT WHEN THEY WERE- CAMPAIGNING REALLY ARE THE THINGS THAT WE SEE AS NEEDSAND THEN WE CAN SUBSTANTIATE THAT WITH THE RESEARCH- THAT'S PART OF THE MASTER PLAN AND THAT. THE DEFINITION OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART OF THE MASTER PLAN. YES SO. I THINK IT'S A GOOD POINT SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE'RE SEEING THAT THE COVER NINETEEN. PACKAGE IT'S ONE TIME MONEY AND SO IT'S NOT THE ON GOING FEDERAL BUDGET WHICH CAN GIVE US ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. FOR YOU KNOW ONGOING ISSUES LIKE REIMBURSEMENT RATES- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT- ACCESS AND SLOT SO DO WE HAVE ANY INDICATION THAT THAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA SEE OTHER FELLOWS ARE FROM THE FROM THE- ONGOING FEDERAL BUDGET. IS GOING TO HELP US IMPLEMENT WE WILL BUT WE UNVEILED IN DECEMBER. WELL IF IT TERMINATE IF WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS IS WHAT MIGHT COME AFTER THE REALLY FUNDS ARE THERE GOING TO BE ON GOING FUNDS WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGETING PROCESS. THE CONGRESS USES OR THROUGH A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT OR BOTH WE CAN'T PREDICT THAT RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT'S REALLY CLEAR IS THAT THE OKAY NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED GREAT GREAT- HARD TO THE EARLY LEARNING SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS RELIEF DOLLARS WILL DO A LOT TO BRING US. CLOSER TO WHERE WE WERE BUT AS I SAID IN MY OPENING REMARKS IT WAS AFRAID FRAGILE SYSTEM TO BEGIN WITH AND WHAT WE HOPE IS IF WE CAN USE THE RELIEF DOLLARS STRATEGICALLY. AND CONTINUE TO BUILD THE SYSTEM TO CREATE GREATER RACIAL EQUITY GREATER OUTCOMES MORE SUPPORT FOR THE WORK FORCE AND A GREATER ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE QUICKLY AND- ACCURATELY WITH PARENTS ABOUT THE CARE THAT'S AVAILABLE. WE CAN DO SOMETHING REALLY REALLY AND TRANSFORMATIVE WITH ADDITIONAL DOLLARS DOWN THE ROAD AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO USING THE RELIEF DOLLARS TO BRING OURSELVES CLOSER TO WHERE WE WERE AND THAT THE CLOSER THAN WHERE WE WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. SO THAT WINDOWS INFRASTRUCTURE ON GO TO I'M GOING DOLLARS KIND WE CAN INCLUDE THE BILL I'M A SYSTEM. WE WILL BE PROUD OF. OKAY AND YOU KNOW WE DID AS WE NOTED SOME PROPOSALS IN THAT JANUARY BUDGET HOPING THAT HOPE TO ALIGN WITH THE MASTER PLAN WRECKERS- CERTAINLY WHEN THE BUDGET WAS PUT TOGETHER IN DECEMBER WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THAT YOU KNOW COVERED ECONOMY NOW IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE D. DO WE THINK THAT WE'LL SEE I MEAN CERTAINLY WE WILL HAVE SOME IDEAS ON ART LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BUT DO WE THINK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WILL HAVE SOME REVISED IDEAS WITH RESOURCES IN THE MAY REVISED TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON OUR CARL THANK YOU ERA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH REGARDS IT BACK- WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS TACKLE SOME I THINK MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED WERE ALSO WAITING. FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS THAT- I KNOW PERSONALLY MYSELF I'VE SEEN ON THE NEWS THAT. SOMETHING MAY OCCUR HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OKAY AND THEN I HAVE TO FINAL- T. K. QUESTIONS MAYBE THIS CAN GO BACK TO CHRIS. ENGINE NOW- YOU MAY SEE THESE IN THE IN THE AGENDA AS WELL NOT SURE IF. THAT IS ACTUALLY AN AGENT YES YOU MAY SEE THEM IN PAGE THREE OF THE AGENDA. THE FINAL TWO QUESTIONS THERE AND IN THE BULLETS- AS FAR AS- WE DID TALK ABOUT THIS IN OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO. SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS THAT THE BUDGET A FOCUS ON ONE TIME MONEY TO HELP INCENTIVIZE AND SPUR- DISTRICTS TO IMPLEMENT TEEKAY AND START THE PROCESS AND WANTED TO AGAIN QUERY- THE HIT YOU ALL ON THAT THE RECOMMENDATION FOR FULL FUNDING. FOR T. K. I NGUYEN THI WHEN- WHEN IT'S FULLY REALIZED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IS THE NOTION THAT IT WILL BE PAID FOR WITH EXISTING PROP NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES OR DO YOU THINK THAT- THE STATE NEEDS TO LOOK AT- YOU KNOW- PUTTING MONEY ON TOP OF THAT ARE YOU KNOW JUST WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IN THE BUDGET SO FAR. ONE TIME MONIES- WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK- CHRIS ORIGIN NOW. TELL ME WHEN HE STARTED INTENDED TO CRESCENT AND MAYBE EVEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NAY ON AWAY INTO THIS BUT- I YOU KNOW WHAT WE PREPARED IN THE MASTER PLAN WAS. AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WE SAW ON THE RESEARCH WITH REGARD TO- YOU KNOW THE- PACKED OF. TREES OTHER LEACH. OPPORTUNE AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW MADE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE- SEE GREAT VALUE AND A UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL- FOR ALL HILDREN AND HAVING. AN OPPORTUNITY AT THE AGE OF FOUR AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE LOW INCOME AND- IN CHILDREN WITH THAT ARE IDENTIFIED WITH A DISABILITY HAVING TWO YEARS PRESCHOOL. WE'VE ALSO THEM ACOSTA GOT OUT BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH WE WOULD THEN FINANCES SO WHAT WE FOUND- IN OUR REVIEW OF THINGS IS. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE AWARE OF THE PROP NINETY EIGHT DYNAMICS WERE AWARE OF. THE POTENTIAL FOR FEDERAL FUNDS SO THE ABILITY TO THINK ABOUT WHERE THOSE REVENUES COME FROM- WAS NOT LAID OUT IN SPECIFICS HOWEVER AND I THINK. THE L. A- POINTED THAT OUT- BUT WE DO HAVE THE COST ANALYSIS FOR THOSE. VARIOUS PARTS OF THE PLANT. FINANCE DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. YEAH I WAS THERE A PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I WOULD JUST ADD THAT HE THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND TRANSITIONAL PARK IN THE GARDEN IS AS JOURNAL SAYS BORN OUT OF THE RESEARCH FROM THE MASTER PLAN IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING STRUCTURE ON THAT WOULD SUSTAIN ANY FUTURE PROPOSALS- TO MAKE THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS ONGOING WOULD NECESSARILY LEVERAGE THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OF LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES INCLUDING. OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS THAT THEY USE- THAT'S NOT IN OUR PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT. OF THE FUNDS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING FOR THESE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW THEY ARE UTILIZING THIS PROP NINETY EIGHT PHONES. THANK YOU AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION IS- EXCUSE ME THE LAST QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT T. K. STANDARDS IN ALIGNMENT I KNOW THAT WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU- SO I WRITE US ABOUT THIS. ONE THING YOU SAID IS WHAT ABOUT THE STANDARDS TK'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN PRESCHOOL WE HAVE YOU KNOW A YOU KNOW MORE REASONABLE RATIOS AND SO WE'RE PUTTING MONEY ON THE BUDGET TO HELP DISTRICTS FURTHER EXPAND T. K. THERE WERE SILENCE OR- NOT WE ARE WE'RE WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT OUR LEGISLATION THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HASN'T SPOKEN UP ABOUT- ALIGNMENT IN NTK STANDARDS. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSD- NOW OR STORE DOWN THE ROAD. HELLO AGAIN SIR BERNARD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE STANDARDS BETWEEN THOSE TWO PROGRAMS. ARE DIFFERENT THE WAY THAT OUR CURRENT PROPOSALS ARE SET UP- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE INTERACTION OF FACTS THAT WE WOULD SEE FROM AN ONGOING TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION ARE GOING TO BE REALIZED AT THE VERY LEAST IN THE BUDGET YEAR. WITH THE INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM THERE IS A ONE YEAR- DATA COLLECTION PROCESS THAT WE HOPE TO GET FROM LEDS BEFORE WE START ANOTHER YEAR OF DOLING OUT THOSE INCENTIVE GRANTS- AND THAT PROCESS ALLOWS US. TO SEE WHAT SORT OF CAPACITY BUILDING MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN UP THROUGH THESE GRANTS AND DETERMINE HOW WE CAN BUILD UPON A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL SO AT THIS TIME WE THINK THAT THESE. ARTICULAR GRANT PROGRAMS ARE SHORT TERM IN NATURE- AND- TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN STATE PRESCHOOL AND TRANSITIONAL CONTEMPORARY GRANT WILL BE REALIZED IN THE FUTURE IS CERTAINLY A CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO. AND UNDERSTAND ITS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER FOR ANY EXPANSION OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE ANY CHANGES THAT WE MAY LOOK AT AS A RESULT OF RESEARCH FROM THE MASTER PLAN. WILL COME TO FRUITION SO WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT- TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY EXPAND THEY WILL WE WILL. LOOK FORWARD TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT ALIGNING THOSE AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU AND AGAIN AS AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME. IDEAS ABOUT THIS THAT WILL BE PUTTING FORWARD POTENTIALLY IN THE BUDGET. AND THROUGH COMPANION LEGISLATION. ANYMORE QUESTIONS ON THE MASTER PLAN THE SECOND SECTION. SEEING NONE- LET'S PROCEED NOW WITH THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM THANK YOU IT WAS VERY HELPFUL ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS RELATED TO ACTUAL OF THE BUDGET AND SOME OF EARLY ACTIONS AND WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE ISSUE NUMBER TWO.

DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE DONE AND ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON WE KNOW THAT THE FIELD IS STILL STRUGGLING. ISSUES INCLUDE CHALLENGES WITH STAFFING MULTIPLE CLOSURES ARE GRAHAM'S- CLASSROOMS DIFFICULTY ACCESSING TESTING OUR VACCINE AND INCREASED PROGRAM COSTS TO ADDRESS HEALTH AND SAFETY. INCREASE STAFFING NEEDS SUPPORTING IN PERSON AND DISTANCE LEARNING MODELS. TO ADDRESS SPENDING. AND THE DECREASED ENROLLMENT TO MAINTAIN SMALLER GROUP SIZES AND THE- COPART AND- AT CAN'T DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. YOU CAN LICENSING AND CONFUSION OVER FAMILY FEES ESPECIALLY WHEN A PROGRAM IS HAD TO CLOSE AND REOPEN DETERMINE EXPOSURE. RESHAPED ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED TO DATE SINCE THINK WILL REALLY GO FAR TO ADDRESS THE SKILLS WE ALSO GREATLY ONE APPRECIATE AND ACKNOWLEDGE INCLUDING EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROVIDERS AND TEACHERS IN THE ALLOCATION OF THE 10% OF VACCINES FOR EDUCATORS. MOVING FORWARD WE ALL KNOW THERE'S MORE TO DO IN THIS AREA ESPECIALLY ABOUT A STRONG EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD AND CERTIFIED BUT WENT BACK TO THE MASTER PLAN DISCUSSION ON THAT. AS WE LOOK AT NEW INVESTMENT IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE L. A. WE WOULD RECOMMEND WAITING PAYING THE FEES FOR OUR ALL FAMILIES ADDITIONALLY LIKE TO FLAG THE NEED FOR CONTINUED HOLD HARMLESS FOR BOTH DIRECT CONTRACT IN ABOUT YOUR PROVIDERS. THESE ACTIONS WOULD STABILIZE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS DURING A TIME OF STRESS NEED. ADDITIONAL STIPENDS THAT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE ENTIRE EARLY LEARNING CARE FIELD COULD ALSO HELP PROGRAMS ADDRESSED THE ADDITIONAL COST FOR DOING BUSINESS DO TO COMBAT NINETEEN. AS WELL AS STABILIZING THESE PROGRAMS DURING THIS TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN ADDRESS THE NEED FOR ALL WORKING PARENTS NOT JUST THAT IS USING SUBSIDIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'M HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. THANK YOU PERMANECE SERVICES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I'M I ALSO JUST WANT TO REALLY UP LEFT THE TREMENDOUS EFFORT THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ACROSS OUR STATEAND AGAIN THAT THAT DOCUMENT IS CHALLENGED AND THAT WE HAVE AHEAD OF US AND SO CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF BOTH THE WORK FORCE AND THE CHALLENGES THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE FAMILIES THE POOREST. ARE REAL YOUR YOUR AGENDA AT ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS RELATED TO LOSS OF CAPACITY SO I WILL. A POINTS OUT- PAGE EIGHT ON YOUR AGENDA THAT HAS SOME INFORMATION. THROUGH I DON'T REMEMBER. IF WE LOOK THROUGH FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR THE TOTAL CAPACITY LOSSES OVER FIFTY TWO THOUSAND AB PLACES THAT CHILDREN COULD OTHERWISE BEEN SERVED- OF COURSE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ANY NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE HAD SOME NEW CAPACITY ESTABLISHED OVER THE COURSE. OF THE LAST YEAR IN SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS CONSIDERED IT'S ACTUALLY A LESS THAN A- 1% AT CHANGING EITHER DIRECTION WHEN WE LOOK AT NUMBER OF FACILITIES AND CAPACITY BUT CERTAINLY AGAIN. ARE THERE WAS NEED AN ADDITIONAL SUPPLY AND SUPPORT NEEDED PRETENSE TO MAKE- AND CERTAINLY WILL BE S. B. WE'RE GOING TO RECOVERY. AT THIS EVENT I TERMS OF YOUR QUESTIONS TO ASK AROUND FLEXIBILITY TO GET APPRECIATE THAT THE PARTNERSHIP AND THAT SEVERAL OF THE ITEMS THAT HAVE STARTED WORKING JUST PRESENTED. AT THAT WE WORKED ON TOGETHER BUT I WOULD JUST SAY AS WE'RE LEARNING NOT ONLY IN THE SPACE OF CHILD CARE AND. DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BUT ACROSS OTHER. MS THAT WE'VE MADE A- THAT SOME OF THINGS THAT WE WANT TO SEE CONTENT IN IN MAXIMO. TAKE OP. TO LOOK FOR OUTER THE WAYS IN WHICH- BOTH FAMILIES THE M. PROGRAM MINISTRIES ARE CONNECTING WITH THAT SO LOOKING AT. MULTIPLE MODALITIES THINGS LIKE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES AND A NUMBER OF PLACES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AS WE ALL AND MANY OF US CONTINUE TO WORK IN A REMOTE ENVIRONMENT. I WE ALSO AGAIN I WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR WE HAD A NUMBER OF FLEXIBILITY WE HAVE. IMPLEMENTED EARLY ON RELATED TO THE ALLOWANCE OF CREATION CREATING POP UP. AT PROGRAMS THAT REALLY THAT'S A COMBINATION. OF BOTH EXPANDED TO- CAPACITY. FOR LICENSE PROGRAM SO MAYBE IT WAS A SMALL FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SERVE AFTER EACH. STEP THROUGH A WAIVER I WITH THE DEPARTMENT I WAS ABLE TO INCREASE TO FOURTEEN. AS WELL AS CENTERS IN THE BACKSPACE AND SO WE HAVE WELL OVER NINE HUNDRED. I PROGRAMS IN THE POP UP CATEGORY AND AGAIN THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THOSE WERE THAT MORE THE LICENSE PROGRAM EXPANSIONS. AND SO ONE THING THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING IT'S REALLY PROVIDING SOME DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO SEE IF WE CAN'T STREAMLINED. AWARE THAT CAPACITY X. EXPAND CAPACITY CAN CONTINUE AND WE CAN SUPPORT THAT BECOMING A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION SET TO OFFER AT THE FAMILY'S GOING FORWARD. ALSO FOR THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT FOR MY FUTURE AND WHERE THAT'S APPROPRIATE WE LOOKED AT ALSO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS TO GET THEM LICENSE TO HAVE THAT CAPACITY BUILT. I WOULD ALSO JUST. ECHO BECAUSE COUPLE THINGS THAT MISSED AND THAT JUST OUTLINED RELATED TO REALLY ACT. BE ABLE TO. PROGRAM ASKED ARE EXT. BOAST CHANGES TO. THEIR OWN AVAILABILITY IN THE WORK FORCE AT BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE COMING INTO THEIR PROGRAMS. I'M IN THE IN THE- CONDITIONS IN GUIDANCE KEEP UP ALL OF THOSE PARTIES THAT SAFE AND HEALTHY AND SO. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOES NOT NOT DAYS AND MAKING SURE AGAIN THAT ACCESS IS CRITICAL THESE ARE GOING TO BE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO WE HAVE DONE AND THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT GOING FORWARD- I THINK AGAIN JUST TO EARLIER CONVERSATION. AB THERE'S A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US ALL IN TERMS OF AT THIS RECOVERY AND- THINKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE. MAKING THE CONNECTION FOR FAMILIES REALLY BUILDING AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY ACROSS THE FIELD BUT ALSO. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THINGS LIKE EXPANDED PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND- OTHER WAYS THAT OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE SUPPORTED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- OF ALL START UP WITH THIS A FEW QUESTIONS ON ON THAT SO OBVIOUSLY WE WE'VE ACTED ALREADY EARLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TO ADDRESS EARLY EDUCATION CHILD CARE AND THE PANDEMIC WITH WITH FEDERAL FUNDS. IN SO JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT THINGS THAT WE DID RIGHT NOW IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT- CONTINUING. IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND BEYOND. SO WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT. YES THE KIDS HERE I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY A COUPLE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I OUTLINED AGAIN I THINK ARE REALLY CRITICAL STILL LOOKING AT. AGAIN THE WAYS. IN WHICH- MR TRADERS ARE CONNECTING WITH FAMILIES USING SOME REMOTE OPPORTUNITIES TO LET TRAFFIC SIGNATURES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- ALLOWED FOR- AGAIN AT A FAST. HI GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT. TO BECOME LICENSE OR EXPAND CAPACITY- AND AGAIN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE PROVIDED SUPPORT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THEY COULD. NOT REMAIN OPEN. AND BE ABLE TO OPERATE UNDER ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE. AND IT IS THE THIRD NOVEL MARC AND FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THAT AD THAT WE THINK IT'S ITS REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU CONTINUE WITH THE FULL TERM LESS FOR THIS NEXT YEAR. EXTEND BEING AT THE MAXIM AND CERTIFICATE BRING OTHER FISCAL YEAR AND WAITING FAMILY FEES FOR ALL FAMILIES. OKAY OUR AT THE NEXT I WANT TO FOCUS ON. THE VIABILITY OF JUST PROVIDERS IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU CAN ISN'T MY SEVENTY YEAR HAVING THESE HEARINGS AND- WE'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT EVEN THE BEST OF TIMES OPERATING AND OWNING A- CHILD CARE BUSINESSES. IS TENUOUS AT BEST CONSIDERING THIS PANDEMIC. IT'S BEEN A DISASTER FOR- FOR SO MANY. OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND YOU KNOW NOT LOST UPON THAT THAT SO MANY OF THEM ARE OWNED BY WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. SO CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN- FIRST HAND DURING THIS PANDEMIC- I WANTED TO ASK C. D. E. R. L. A- WE I'VE I WE'VE SEEN COUNTLESS REPORTS AND A LOT OF ANECDOTAL. REPORTS BUT DO WE HAVE ANY SPECIFIC DATA. ON THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF PROVIDERS THAT HAVE CLOSED. DURING THIS PANDEMIC EITHER PERMANENTLY OR TEMPORARILY. AND HOW DO WE HOW WE FEEL ABOUT POTENTIALLY THEM COMING BACK OR THEY CLOSE FOR GOOD. FOR THIS IS. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO THAT THERE IS CLOSURE DATA ON PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA- AND IT DOES HAVE TEMPORARY CLOSE INCRIMINATE CLOTHES ON THERE AND I AND I DO BELIEVE MR JOHNSON AND DID MENTION SOME MORE RECENT DATA THIS DATA IS. AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY SHE SHE MENTIONED HER TESTIMONY DATA I BELIEVE THE FED BE WARY- DISH- SO YEAH SHE SAID SHE DOES HAVE MORE INFORMATION RECENT INFORMATION. ON CLOSURES. SURE SO IN TERMS OF- NUMBER AB LIKE TO KIND OF REFERENCE YOUR AGENDA HERE AND PROVIDE SOME UPDATED INFORMATION AS AT THE END OF. FEBRUARY IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF OPEN AND OPERATING PROGRAMS- WE HAVE A TOTAL AT THROUGH FEBRUARY OF AB. THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND PROGRAMS THAT'S- TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES AND TEN THOUSAND CENTERS. AT TEMPORARILY CLOSED WE HAVE AT SEVEN THOUSAND PROGRAMS AND THAT'S A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND SLOTS THROUGH FEBRUARY AND PERMANENTLY CLOSED FROM MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT'S A TOTAL AB AT THIRTY THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX FACILITIES THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF. ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES AND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT CHILD CARE CENTERS FOR A TOTAL OF FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE SLOTS AND AGAIN AS I REFERENCED I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HAD SOME NEW CAPACITY. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR AS WELL SO AND THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT YOU CAPACITY IN THE NUMBERS I JUST PROVIDED. OKAY THAT'S THE PROBLEM OR QUESTION ON THIS ON THE ON THE OF COURSE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN LARGELY CLOSED UP UNTIL RECENTLY- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN THE ISSUE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND MOST OF THESE SCHOOL SITE THAT HAD CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS ON SITE CLOSED AS WELL DURING COVER NINETEEN ART IS IT IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCE SCHOOL WAS CLOSED ALMOST ALWAYS THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WAS CLOSED OR NOT ALWAYS. HE SAID FIFTY THIRD NEVER WORKING WITH THE EDUCATION. SO WE WOULD STAY. OFTEN BUT NOT ALWAYS AT THE SCHOOL SITE WAS CLOSED THEN THAT'S STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT WAS ON THE CAMPUS ALSO WITH HAD TO CLOSE AND I WAS OFTEN DUE TO OTHER SAFETY ISSUES THAT THEY CAN'T WAS THERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE OTHER RESOURCES AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN PLACE. M. AS WELL AS VARIOUS THINGS WHERE THAT STAFF MAY NOT ALSO BEEN IN THE SAME COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT OVERALL MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS STATE OPEN WITH ABOUT JUST OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TOTAL SITE. CURRENTLY CLOSED AND ABOUT THIRTEEN UNDER GOT THOSE ARE OPERATED. BY ONLY AS BUT- OUR PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALSO OPEN AND WE KNOW THE- PROGRAMS ARE IN THE MIDST OF A- THEY ALSO WERE OPERATING AND DISTANCE LEARNING IF THEY WERE PHYSICALLY CLOSED AND THEIR FAMILIESWERE STILL GETTING SOME SORT OF SERVICE THAT. EVEN IF IT WASN'T IN PERSON. WE HAVE HEARD THAT ANECDOTALLY AT LEAST AND THAT WARMER PROGRAMS ARE RE OPENING. WITH SCHOOLS REOPENING AND WITH THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION INCREASING. OUR PROGRAMS THAT HAVE REMAINED OPEN THAT ONE IS THINGS THAT THEY'VE REALLY STRUGGLED WITH IS THAT IF. ONE OF THEIR STAFF MEMBERS ARE COPAYS. FOR A FAMILY DEAD THEY THEN WOULD HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN THE PROGRAM. IS DOWN TO CLASSROOMS AND THEN GETTING THAT STUDENTS OR OTHER TEACHING STAFF AND TO SUPPORT IT WAS VERY CHALLENGING. SO IT'S JUST BEEN AN OVERALL MIXED. BAG ACROSS OUR FOR BROWN'S. OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AS SCHOOLS REOPEN. WORKING KEEP WORKING AT THE SEPT THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER TWO THIS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM AS WELL BEFORE I GET TO THE BUDGET PROPOSALS. SEMIRAMIDE AT. YEAH I'D LOVE TO LOOK AT THIS FROM THE BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE ESPECIALLY SINCE WE KNOW THAT TIME. FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS- TEND TO BE WOMEN TEND TO BE WOMEN OF COLOR AS WELL MINORITY WOMEN. I'M TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS THERE ANY CONSIDERATION TO WAIVING THE ANNUAL LICENSE FEE FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. THIS IS OUR PARTNER I. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO THAT WAS NOT A PARTICULAR PART OF OUR VARIOUS SCOPE IN NINETEEN PROPOSALS. BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO STRONGLY URGE YOU KNOW SOME CONSIDERATION THERE WE'VE GIVEN- WE WAIVES FEES FOR OTHER BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS AND THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT WE HAVE TO SUPPORT RIGHT NOW IN THIS MOMENT SO I'D APPRECIATE THAT CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND- AND ARE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS- TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE AT. ACTUALLY TO ASK I'M NOT SURE WHO WOULD HAVE THIS INFORMATION BUT- LAST SUMMER THERE WAS A CHILD CARE SURVEY- THAT HAD SOME REALLY INTERESTING DATA IS WAS UP THE MOST A RECENT BUILD SURVEY OF HOW OUR INDUSTRY LOOKS IN AND ANTICIPATES- BASING IT OR GET THEM DURING THE PANDEMIC AND MOVING OUT OF THIS KIND OF BECAUSE ANYONE ELSE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN JOHNSON DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL SERVICES A COUPLE THINGS I ACTUALLY WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WE WERE ABLE TO WAY OUT LICENSING FEES FROM APRIL THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY SO JUST WANTED TO. ENSURE THAT THAT COMPONENT BUT THE- AT YOUR QUESTION AROUND SERVING YES YOU HAVE A LOT OF. BOTH ARE. OUT OF GOVERNMENT ENTITIES DURING THE SERVING AS WELL AS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT ACROSS ALL LICENSE PROGRAMS AGAIN LICENSED FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES THE CENTERS- WE- INSTITUTED WHAT'S CALLED OUR EVERBRIDGE SYSTEM WHERE WE ARE. ASKING FOR ANY PRETTY SIMPLISTIC FONG AB MECHANISM. FOR PROGRAMS TREE COURT AND THAT NEEDS AB WOULD GET TEMPORARY CLOSURES PERMANENT CLOSURES IT'S THAT RAP. FORCE THAT THEY'RE CLOSING PERMANENTLY THEY HAVE TO NOTIFY US IN SEPARATE WAYS SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. AT SOME INFORMATION SERVING AFTER THAT MECHANISM OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO DO. SOME REPORTING RELATED TO CODE POSITIVITY FOR BOTH AT THE CHILDREN IN CARE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLDS AS WELL AS- FOR THE WORK FORCE THAT'S POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WEBSITE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN BUT AGAIN. I WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON BOTH LOOKING AT CAPACITY. AND HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE PROGRAMS AND THAT NEEDS WHICH ALLOWED US TO VERY VERY QUICKLY BE ABLE TO. STAND UP THINGS LIKE THE PORTER PORTAL FOR FAMILIES TO KNOW WHICH PROGRAMS WERE OPEN. ALSO BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT THE DISTRIBUTION AB AT PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT OR PP. I THINK THE FIELD WITH THE- LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS RESOURCE REFERRAL AGENCIES AND OTHERS SO. I'D NUMBER OF WAYS WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE WORK FORCE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. AND TO CLARIFY THE FEES THAT WERE WAVE AND APRIL THROUGH JUNE WAS SOLD AS A CHILD CARE PROVIDER A LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER YOUR FEE IS DUE ANNUALLY BASED ON WHEN YOUR LICENSE. WAS APPROVED SO IS IT ONLY LICENSES THAT WERE DUE APRIL THROUGH. JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT WERE WAIVED. THAT'S CORRECT ALL TRIPLE CHECK A CONFIRM BUT THAT THAT WOULD BE. SO AGAIN AND- I'M THANKFUL FOR THAT BUT WE REALLY NEED TO SAKE TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT EXPANDING THIS- AT ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL TIMES FOR PROVIDERS. THANK YOU. THE MEMBER ARRESTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF. I THINK WHEN WHENEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE- CHILD CARE I THINK WE HAVE TO BEGIN BY SAYING THANK YOU TO LAWS CHILD CARE PROVIDERS- THEY HAVE. DONE SO MUCH ESPECIALLY DURING THIS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC- HAVE RISKED THEIR HEALTH THEIR SAFETY. JUST TO CONTINUE SERVING OUR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES OUR CHILDREN- OFTENTIMES PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK- SOME PEOPLE HAVE REFERRED TO THEM AND I AGREE AS THE HEROES ARE THE SHE ROSE- DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. THAT THEY ARE I. SO I WANT TO BEGIN WITH THAT. WHEN I READ ABOUT THE- CHILD CARE CENTERS THAT HAVE CLOSED. WITH THOSE OF CLOSE TEMPORARILY AND THOSE THAT CLOSED PERMANENTLY THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS OF THAT OF COURSE THAT ARE OF GREAT CONCERN ONE IS THE CHILDREN THAT ARE NOT BEING CARED FOR BUT THE OTHER IS THE BUSINESS ASPECT THESE ARE ALL BASICALLY SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. OWNED AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS INDICATED BUT USUALLY BY WOMEN AND ALMOST ALWAYS BY WOMEN OF COLOR. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE GOING UNDER AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE EVEN MORE CONCERNED. THAN WE HAVE BEEN THE TEMPORARY CLOSURES I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GAVE THE NUMBERS ON THOSE I DID NOTE THAT THE PERMANENT CLOSURES AS OF NOW OR HIGHER THAN ARE LISTED ON PAGE EIGHT. OF. THE INFORMATION THAT YOU THERE HAD BEEN PER. SO IT BEEN THREE THOUSAND THREE. IT A SLUSH NOW WE UP TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND EIGHTY. PER CLOSED IS THAT AT IS A CORRECT. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S CORRECT IN TERMS OF PERMANENT CLOSURES THAT'S THAT THE TOTAL CAPACITY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SERVED. OVER THE THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX THE SAUDIS THAT CLOSED OVER THE COURSE OF THAT TIME PERIOD. Q. AND ON THE TEMPORARY CLOSURES COULD YOU GIVE US THE UPDATED NUMBERS. CERTAINLY A TEMPORARY CLOSURES AT THROUGH FEBRUARY AT SEVEN THOUSAND NINETY FOUR FACILITIES IN YEAH AND THAT THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED A FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES IN FORTY FIVE HUNDRED CHECK YOUR CENTERS. TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND CAPACITY OR SLOTS. SO THAT IF THIS IS CORRECT THEN THAT MEANS THAT THOSE THAT WERE TEMPORARILY CLOSED BEFORE HAVE NOW MOVED TO THE PERMANENTLY CLOSED. THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO DISCREET SEX SO THE PERMANENTLY CLOSE PROBE AT PROGRAMS WOULD BE ALL ALL WRAPPED UP THERE IN THE TEMPORARILY CLOSER TO AS OF FEBRUARY PROGRAMS THAT ARE STILL. NOT INDICATING TO LICENSING THAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO CLOSE BUT THEY ARE CURRENTLY NOT SERVING CHILDREN SO TO TWO DISTINCT GROUPS OKAY BECAUSE IT TEMPORARILY CLOSED WENT FROM EIGHT THOUSAND DOWN TO SEVEN THOUSAND. WHERE IS THE PERMANENTLY CLOSED WENT FROM. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TO THIRTY THREE HUNDRED. SO SOME OF THE TEMPORARY CLOSE COULD HAVE OPENS AND SO THEY WOULD SHOW UP IN THE OPENING OPENS AT GROUP. VERY GOOD VERY GOOD AND YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT IT AT THAT. FONG QUESTIONING FROM THE CHAIR ABOUT THE DATA- CAN YOU SHARE WITH US HOW THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT THE RE OPENING OF OUR STATE AND OF OUR ECONOMY. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT CAN WE DO AS A STATE TO HELP THESE CHILD CARE FACILITIES- BE PART OF THE RE OPENING OF THE STATE AND THE ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER ABSOLUTELY AT THAT THE- IMPORTANCE- CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THE SERVICES IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE ECONOMY IN THE WORK FORCE THERE ABSOLUTELY TIED. TOGETHER AND REALLY DO SUPPORT FAMILIES TO ENGAGE IN THE WORK FORCE I IN A DIFFERENT WAY SO WE FULLY SUPPORTS AND PRIORITIZE THAT AS A AS A AS A CONCEPT OF HOW WE- WORK TOGETHER AND SUPPORT FAMILIES. I WE HAVE DONE A LOT AS HAS BEEN OUTLINED TODAY OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR AFFECTED TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING IN THERE AND THE CRITICAL IMPACT ABOUT THIS SCANDAL HAS HAD ON THE SYSTEM WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE TO DO. SO IT'S A I WOULD SAY THAT IS A BOTH A THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE WORK FORCE THAT FAMILIES IN TERMS OF THE SOLUTION ING AND WAYS IN WHICH WE CREATE NEW POLICY PROGRAMS AND INVESTMENTS IS THAT CERTAINLY A COMMITMENT OF OURS. I WE WILL HAVE TO BOTH LOOK AT RECRUITMENT- HAVE NEW PROGRAMS AT NEW CAPACITY BEING BUILT BASED ON THE NUMBERS THAT I JUST PROVIDED BUT ALSO TRULY SUPPORTING OF THOSE THAT ARE OPEN TODAY WHO ARE IN NEED OF THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AS AS BEEN OUTLINES. AT THIS AFTERNOON SO IT WILL BE A MULTI PRONGED SOLUTION THAT WILL NEED TO OUT WORK THROUGH THE SUPPORT HAVING THE FULL ARRAY INTO FIVE TO THE FAMILY'S NEEDS I THINK AGAIN WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THINGS LIKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND OPTIONS. AND THAT FAMILIES CAN HAVE ARE PART OF THAT THAT SCHOOL ARRAY. OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK TO. AND JUST AS IT I MAY CHAIR YES- THE- WENT WHEN- IT THE IF YOU'RE IN A- AND YOUR- START TO LAY. YOU OFTENTIMES AN EXIT INTERVIEW SO THAT YOU CAN EVALUATE WHAT IT IS IT'S WRONG AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE. IN THOSE THAT HAVE PERMANENTLY CLOSED. IS THERE SUCH A SURVEY BEING DONE TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE REALLY PERMANENTLY CLOSED BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THAT WE ARE. LOSING THIS EXPERIENCE- FROM THESE FROM THE THESE WORKERS THESE FACILITIES. IT'S GOING TO BE LOST UNLESS WE'RE ABLE TO AS YOU SAYING GAUGE THEM AND- AND IT CHANGE THE WORK FORCE. IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE WEAKENED RE HIRE THE MORE OR HELP THEM TO REOPEN IS THERE SUCH A THING AS AN EXIT INTERVIEW OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT. IT'S A GREAT A GREAT POINT ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT A CLOSURE INFORMATION IS A DIFFERENT MECHANISM THAT THAT'S COMMUNICATED TO OUR LICENSING SERVER PROGRAM IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING I'M NO LONGER GOING TO BE A LICENSE OPERATOR I DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THE LISTING ETCETERA. I HAD SOME WORK AT PERMANENT COMPONENT THAT DISTANCE CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK AT AS TO THE REASONS WHY. EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC WHEN WE HAD MANY PROGRAMS THAT WERE IN THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE. GROUP AGAIN AS WE HAD BEAT SO OF COURSE WE HAVE OUR PARTICULAR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JENNIFER CHOI WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES NOTHING WE NEED TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT HAPPY TO HELP ITS RAINY. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU I'M SURE A FEW QUESTIONS SO OF QUESTION NUMBER ONE WE'VE HEARD THIS LOUD AND CLEAR FROM OUR- FOR MARK COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ALSO FROM OUR PROVIDERS FOR EASY AS FAR AS THE COLAB AND- LACK OF A OF AN EQUITABLE COLOR BETWEEN OUR K. TWELVE DISTRICTS WITH L. C. F. F. AND- AND EARLY THERE ARE. HARD OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS WHAT YOU CALLED EARLIER ASSEMBLY MEMBER VITAS LITTLEST. LITTLEST LEARNERS AT THE NEW THAT'S A NEW WORD FOR THE DAY- AND SO I MEAN CLEARLY THAT THAT THE COST OF ELECTRICITY AND RENT AND STAFFING AND YOU KNOW EVEN STUFF LIKE MILK AND SO FORTH COSTS THE SAME EVEN IF YOU'RE A- COMMUNITY COLLEGE- AT. THAT INTENSITY OR AN EARLY EDUCATION- PROVIDER OR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE HAVE THESE TWO COLA SO. WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT THIS AND DO YOU DO WE ARE GOING HOLDING HELP SAID THEY'LL BE AN ADJUSTMENT. IN THE MAY REVISE ABOUT THIS. THIS IS SERRA BURNER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALSO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE DID IMPLEMENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR A ONE POINT 5% COAL FOR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS- TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SUPER COOL APPLIED TO- ELEAZAR NOT TO THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. IS PART OF OUR PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME BUT WE'LL CERTAINLY TAKE IT BACK WITH US FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS THIS YEAR FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IS. IS MUCH HIGHER THAN IT HAS BEEN TO THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC A LOT OF THESE FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED TO ADDRESS POLICIES AND DIRECT RELATION TO THE COSTS THAT PROVIDERS ARE FACING- SO WE CERTAINLY HEAR YOUR CONCERNS AND WILL CERTAINLY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. OKAY AND THEN HOW ABOUT- THE- POTENTIAL RESTORATION OF THE CUTS THAT WERE MADE. LAST YEAR FOR CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM EXPANSION AND FACILITIES PROFESSIONAL ELEMENT. CERTAINLY SO THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS AND IT WAS WORKFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPANSION OF SLOTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WHICH WAS SWEPT- DUE TO THE BUDGET REDUCTIONS- AS A RESULT OF THE COCA NINETEEN PANDEMIC SO AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO BRING THOSE PROGRAMS BACK THE INTENTION BEHIND THOSE PROGRAMS THOUGH TO EXPAND OFFERINGS EXPAND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR RULED A pREMAINS IT'S STILL A PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION- BASED ON THE RESEARCH THAT CAME OUT THE MASTER PLAN IT'S TAKING A DIFFERENT SHAPE IN THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE- BUT AT THIS POINT THOSE PROGRAMS WERE NOT PROPOSING TO. REINSTATE FUNDING I GET THAT LET ME JUST RESPECTFULLY PUSHED BACK ON THIS AND WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE HERE WE BOTH WENT TO EXPAND UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL ACCESS THROUGH T. K. BUT IN IN IN DOING THAT TWO OF THE NEEDS OUT OF THE GECKO OUR- FACILITIES AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SO. IT SEEMS THAT THESE THINGS GO HAND IN HAND AND SINCE WE DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET WELLS LIKE WE DID- A YEAR AGO LAST LAST SPRING NOR HAVE WE HAD IN THE FALL IT SEEMS THAT THESE THAT THESE TWO ISSUES ARE RIGHT FOR TAKING A LOOK AND- AND REINSTITUTING THEM AS PRIORITIES IN THE STATE BUDGET SO- AND THEN AS FAR. AS THE- THE R. RATE INCREASES ARE ARE I GUESS WE CAN WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT FROM THE PRACTICAL LEVEL FROM THE PROVIDERS- IN A SECOND BUT HERE WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO. WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT DO YOU THINK THE HAVE ANY ACTION NOW YOU SAID YOU'RE- TAKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS CHRIS PERRY SAID. BUT NOT ALL INDIVIDUALS. WHO BENEFIT FROM INCREASED RATES. ARE PART OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS SOME GROUPS ARE PART OF THAT SO- WHAT'S THE COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO. INCREASING RATES THE ARMAR SMR. SO WE CAN MAKE THESE PROGRAMS VIABLE AND ENSURE THAT WE DON'T PAY THAT. WORKERS FAST FOOD WAGES WHO ARE TAKE CARE OF OUR LITTLEST KIDS. ON THE SERVER NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT ON TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE IN THE FUTURE WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT- SUSTAINABLE RATES AS A BENEFIT TO THE FIELD- WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT KNOWING THAT AS WE- WORK TO TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE. ALREADY IN THIS HEARING WITH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND STATE PRESCHOOL- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE CHANGES ON THAT FRONT SO I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO A CONVERSATION ON THAT IT'S NOT A PARTICULAR PART OF OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS AND I WILL HIT IT OFF TO OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES COLLEAGUES IF THEY- WANT TO COMMENT FURTHER ON THAT. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. OKAY THANK YOU. FURTHER QUESTIONS OUR CONSUMERISM. THANK YOU MISTER AT MY QUESTION IS HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET THE STIPENDS WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE EARLY ACTION BUDGET PACKAGE INTO THE HANDS OF OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. THAT CD. YET SO LET'S DIRECT THAT TO C. D. E. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THAT I THINK I'D MENTIONED THAT A LITTLE BIT IN ONE OF MY CHANNELS ALREADY BUT GOING BACK TO THAT IT AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. SAID THAT WERE READY TO GO WE'VE HAD STATEMENT ALLOCATIONS FOR ABOUT. JUST OVER A THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY CONTRACTS AND SEVEN HUNDRED HUNDRED FOURTEEN CONTRACTORS SO WE'VE COMPLETED THAT PORTION. WORK PROVIDING IT TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THEY'LL TAKE ABOUT TWO WEEKS ONE WHICH I'M NOT BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE HAVE TO MANUALLY ENTER EACH OF THE DATA FOR THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN STATEMENT IN DEFENSE STYLE. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WILL GET IT AND THOSE PAYMENTS ACTUALLY GO TO THE CONTRACTORS AND THEN AFTER THE CONTRACTORS GET IT GETS IN THE HANDS OF THE PROVIDERS. SO WE'RE THINKING THAT THIS CONTRACT- THAT'LL TAKE ABOUT I WOULD SAY THREE TO FOUR MORE. WEEKS TO GET THAT OUT TO THE FIELDS. SO WE'RE LOOKING BASICALLY AT ANOTHER MONTH. SO OR SAYING. COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TAKES A MINIMUM OF TWO WEEKS AND THAT'S ON OUR EXPEDITED TIMELINE WITH THEM. M. THAT GOES TO THE CONTRACTO SO BEFORE THE CHILD CARE PROVIDER RECEIVES IT THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF TIME IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S AND WE'RE STILL WORKING AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE FOR THEM TO BE OF THE FACT THAT THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THE FUNDS OVER TO THEM. AND I'M SURE THAT YOU YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY LOST 30% OF OUR CHILD CARE CAPACITY. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IT IS CRITICAL THAT pOUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS RECEIVED THIS PROMISED. IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SO WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE. TO GET THAT EXPEDITED AND I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON IT BUT I JUST WANTED TO. ELEVATE THE ISSUE BECAUSE WE WE'VE ASKED SO MUCH OF THEM. AND IT WE NOW NEED TO GET THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PROMISED TO THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I JUST MAY ASK QUICKLY I JUST WANT TO KNOW- THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AGAIN CHEN TORIA THE PARCHMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES NEAREST MINISTERING BEST I CAN FOR STAGE ONE AT A CAGR. PROGRAMS AND CERTAINLY SHARE YOUR URGENCY AND-ART EDUCATION ART WORK. HOURS IT'S POSSIBLE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FOR THE STAGE ONE PROGRAM AND WE ARE IN THE MEETING I HAVE THE RECEIPT AT THE STATE AND- THE SOMETIME IN APRIL. AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT CHALFORD COMMITTEE COLLEGE FOUNDATION IS- ACTUALLY- ADMINISTERING THAT DEMANDS- ON OUR BEHALF OR THAT EACH ONE ADMINISTRATION JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT EXTRA PIZZA FOR UNIQUE AND SHARE YOUR- SENSE OF URGENCY WHAT WE'RE GETTING. THOSE ON ABOUT THE- THANK. OKAY THANK YOU SO BY US IN REGARD TO CAO- GIVE THE DEATH IMPACTS WILL BE NINE HI HAD ON LOW WAGE EARNERS IN HIGH RATES OF AND LYFT WHY ARE WE FOR A SAVE OF A FOURTEEN MILLION AND THE COW WORKS CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENTS. OF SOCIAL SERVICES MY HAVE YOU ADDRESS DEPARTED FINANCER DFI EITHER EITHER ONE EITHER ONE. WHOEVER ANSWERED. AB I CAN GET STARTED AND THEN IF MISPERTON WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING APARTMENT OF FINANCES PERSPECTIVE THAT WHILE I'M THERE'S A FEW THINGS GOING ON I THINK WHEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE OVERALL ESTIMATES ARE WORKS HE SPOKE AT ARE ACTUALLY TRENDING LOWER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED I'M NOT JUST FOR CHILD CARE BUT FOR THE CALVET RAM AS A WAR- SOMETHING THAT MAY BE DUE TO THE STIMULUS PAYMENTS AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS THAT HAVE STATE DOCKS AND WE NEED- BUT WE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING. THAT TREND- AS WELL AND SO THAT'S ONE THING ANOTHER THING IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CHANGES BETWEEN THE TRANSITION BACK WORKERS IN MACAU WORK STAGES PROGRAM AS MANY OF. YOU MAY KNOW THERE ARE THE THREE STAGES. STAGE ONE THE END. STAGE EVERY SEAT CHILD AND THEN WHAT'S A OF DEEMED STABLE. THEY TRANSITION TO STAGE THE RULES SO SOME RECENT POLICY CHANGES INCLUDING B. AND MEDIA. INTEREST ELIGIBILITY- HAVE CHANGED HOW LONG FAMILIES ARE STAYING IN STAGE ONE. SOME COUNTIES HAVE ALSO CHANGED THEIR DEFINITIONS OF STABLE WHICH HAS RETAIN SOME FAMILIES LONGER IN SPEECH FORM. IN ORDER TO TRY TO DETERMINE THAT ASPECT AND HOW MUCH THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE STAGE TO SHOWCASE WILL CHANGES WE HAVE ACTUALLY JUST RECENTLY RELEASED A SURVEY- AND WE ARE EXPECTING THE RESULTS OF THAT SURVEY NEEDS TO INFORM US AND WE SHOULD HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE CAN SHARE. BY THE END OF MARCH SO JUST WANT TO PROVIDE THAT CONTEXT- IN CASE THAT IS HELPFUL STAR AND THEN IF THIS. PERSON HAS ANYTHING SHE WANTS TO ADD. SO LET HER ADDED. AFTERNOON CARL SAGAN AT THE OF. WE ANTICIPATE THERE WILL BE STAGE TWO STAVING AND STATE THREE D. SPACE ON THE MOST RECENT AVAILABLE LOS TWO AS CONTINUE TO DECREASE SENSE TWENTY NINETEEN STAGE THREE HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE FOR THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BUDGETED TO COVER STAGE THREE COSTS. THANK YOU FOR. AND THEN- TWO. M. IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE L. A. L. IS. DEPARTMENT EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICES WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE EXPAND ACCESS- TIED TO INCOME AND EARLY INTERVENTION SUPPORT FOR CAO WORKS. TO ALSO INCLUDE CHILDREN THAT ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS THAT THEY ALSO RECEIVE PRIORITY AND THE WAY THESE PROPELLERS PROGRAMS OUR ACTS- ACCESS. TO HELLO- COURTESY LETTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PRIORITY FOR THE LAST- LEGISLATURE WHILE WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR STAFF THANK YOU. AND THE L. L. HAVE AN OPINION ON- WHETHER IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO EXPAND ACCESS BEYOND INCOME AND EARLY INTERVENTION SUPPORT. TO CHILDREN THAT ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS LEARNERS THAT WE KNOW THAT IF YOU CAN AND ENTER KINDERGARTEN HAVING BEEN IN PRESCHOOL ESPECIALLY FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT GREATER OUTCOMES IN READING AND MATHEMATICS. FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS WHAT IS ALEJO THANK. YES THEY ARE CORTES WHAT THE L. A. L. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON ON THIS PROPOSAL OR OR THIS CONCEPT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO SUPPORT TO SUPPORT YOUR PRIORITIES. THANK YOU AND IF ANYONE ELSE WENT AWAY AND THERE HAVE I HAVEN'T TWO MORE QUESTIONS. IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T. SO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAM SPACE ADDITIONAL ONGOING COSTS INCLUDING THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST IS IT MINISTRATION CONSIDERING AN AUGMENTED COLA FOR EARLY LEARNING FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS LIKE IT HAS PROPOSED BERG FORGET YOUR TWELFTH. THIS IS SERVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THAT THAT'S SUPER COOL- CONCEPT THAT WOULD SUBSIDE TO ELEAZAR PART OF OUR PROPOSALS FOR CHILDCARE AND EARLY LEARNING I'M BEYOND THE ONE POINT 5% CALL THAT THEY'RE SEEING IN THE BUDGET YEAR- BUT AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR CONCERNS BACK BUT- I THINK I THINK WHAT IT YOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE IS. THE QUITE LITERALLY THE COST OF LIVING GOES UP AND THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS FOR PROVIDERS- AND IT'S PART OF YOU KNOW THEIR ABILITYTO RETAIN YOU KNOW QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROFESSIONALS SO I COULD APPRECIATE THAT CONSIDERATION- AND LASTLY. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO- PRACTICE INITIATED. THE PRACTICE AND ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY OF USING CANNABIS TAX REVENUES PROP SIXTY FOUR TO FUND CHILD CARE SLOTS. ARE THESE RESOURCES ALLOCATED VIRTUAL FOR CHILD CARE SLOTS AND COUNTIES WERE CANNABIS. TAXES ARE NOT GENERATED. YEAH FREE WRITER. THE. THE SERVER IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC TO THAT LEVEL IN TERMS OF WHERE IT GOES TO CERTAIN COUNTIES THE PROGRAMS ARE STILL ARE SORRY THE FUNDING IS SLOTTED FOR THE ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM TO REFLECT THE NEED THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THAT PROGRAM THIS YEAR PARTICULARLY- BUT TO YOUR QUESTION IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC TO CERTAIN TOWNS. GOT IT THANK YOU. YEAH I JUST LASTLY TO ON THE PROP SIXTY FOUR YOU WE'VE WE'VE HAD A DEBATE LAST YEAR'S ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WHEN SIXTY FOUR WAS ON THE BALLOT THEY TALKED ABOUT HE GOING TO FIND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND WE LEFT CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS SO ON A ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL AND- ARE USING. THESE TO FIND- ADDITIONAL- A. P. SLOTS- AND HE I GUESS IS A QUESTION BY A P. COULD. HAVE CENTER BASED IN DATABASE BUT WE ARE DOING THAT- AND IN LARGE PART I THINK TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE WE WERE TIGHT THE MONEY WE WANTED TO EXPAND THAT. IS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT ALL THINKING- SPECIALLY AS- PROP SIXTY FOUR REVENUES GROW. TO LOOK AT THE INTENT OF THOSE TV COMMERCIALS AND- CERTAIN I CAN BRING THEM THEY HAD GOVERNOR'S THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM CAMPAIGNING FOR IT AND HE SAID IN HIS WORDS. PASSED PROP SIXTY FOUR IT'S TIME TO TAX AND REGULATE MARIJUANA AND FOUND WORTHY PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER SCHOOL. THOSE THOSE ARE THE EXACT WORDS OF THE TV COMMERCIAL- SO. IS THERE A INTENT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT COMMITMENT TO FIND AFTER SCHOOL AS WELL AS CHILD CARE OF PROP. SIXTY FOUR. THANK YOU SIR BERNARD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. THE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE THE CURRENT YEAR- AND THE ONES FOR BUDGET YEAR ARE INAPPROPRIATE TOWARDS THE ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM. WHICH I THINK YOU MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT DO YOU FIND THAT SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AS WELL- THIS IS A REFLECTION UPON THE NEED IN THOSE PROGRAMS THIS YEAR THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH CHILD CARE PROVIDERS- FACING A HIGHER COST OF BUSINESS TO CARE FOR SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN- SO TO THAT. TO THAT SENSE ARE WE ARE CONTINUING ON THAT INTENTION- IF MY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CALLING WANT TO COMMENT MORE ABOUT BUDGET YEAR. I WOULD PASS IT OFF TO THE. THIS IS THERE A NUMBER OF ORGANS AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I WON'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO YOU THAT PROP SIXTY FOUR PERSON EVENT. BY JUST TO BUILD ON WHAT USE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. OUR AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND SAFETY PROGRAM OR A SENSE THIRDS G. THREE EIGHT. AND CONTINUES TO HAPPEN BUT SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IN OUR LAST REQUEST FOR FUNDING ROUNDS WE HAD THREE TIMES THE ARE. VERSUS THE AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR EASTER. AND OVERCAME TRYING HIM OUT REQUESTED FOR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS. WE SERVE NEARLY ONE MILLION CHILDREN. I AND KNOW THAT THEY NEED AND DESIRE FOR ENRICHING. AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER PROGRAMS IT'S FAR FAR BEYOND THAT NEARLY A MILLION CHILDREN. ABOUT WHAT EVALUATION FOUND THAT. PARTICIPATING CHILDREN ATTENDED. THAT WORK IN OUR AS PART. THEN IT'S SCHOOL FOUR TO SEVEN DAYS MORE. THAN SIMILAR NON. SHARES AT THAT SCHOOL. SO WE REALLY BELIEVE IT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT HELPS OUR CHILDREN STANDS WILL DO BETTER IN SCHOOL AND PROVIDES THE NECESSARY CARE THAT FAMILIES NEED. IT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE MASTER PLAN AS A COMPONENT POSSIBILITY AROUND LOOKING AT T. K. AND K. THROUGH THIRD AND EATING SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO SUPPORT CHILDREN. I THINK YOU MENTIONED THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FACT YOU CAN EAT EVEN IF IT'S A SCHOOL DAY DOESN'T ACTUALLY FIT THE FULL DAY OF A WORKING FAMILY. AND SO WHERE COULD EASE THIS COMMAND TO FIRE REALLY SUPPORT THAT SCHOOL SITE IN PROVIDING A MORE ROBUST. DAY FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE WORKING. OKAY THANK YOU I WITH THAT WE WILL. HOLD THIS OPEN AND TAKE A LOOK AGAIN AFTER. C. E. AT STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE A PANELIST A GRAB OF A PANEL OF PROVIDERS I AND- ENTITIES IN THE FIELD THEY CAN SHARE THEIR INSIGHT ON EASKEY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH JESSICA GET UP WITH THE CHILD CARE ALLIANCE OF LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MCCARTY AN ASSEMBLYMEMBERS AND JESSICA. AM I PUBLIC POLICY ASSOCIATE FOR THE CHILD CARE ALLIANCE OF LOS ANGELES AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WHAT YOU SEE COALITION. AS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS DISRUPTED EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW OUR CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR. BUT IT HASN'T DISTRICT ARE CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN. NOW MORE THAN EVER PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD CARE IS ESSENTIAL IT'S ESSENTIAL NOT ONLY FOR FAMILIES AND THE EDUCATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN BUT ALSO FOR EMPLOYERS AND OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC. ECONOMIC HEALTH. WOMEN PARTICULARLY BLACK IN LINE NEXT WOMEN HAVE LOST THE MOST DURING THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WHEN FAMILIES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE IT'S WOMEN WHO ARE LEAVING THE WORKFORCE TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. IN EQUITY USING HOW CHILD CARE IS FUNDED AND SUPPORTED HAS FOR TOO LONG MEANT THAT FAMILIES WITH LOW INCOME STRUGGLE TO FIND. AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE CARE ESPECIALLY FOR BABIES AND TODDLERS. AND PROVIDERS MOST WHO ARE WOMEN OF COLOR. HAVE NOT BEEN PAID ENOUGH TO MAKE A LIVING WAGE. THE EXISTING INEQUITIES AND THE PANDEMIC HAVE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE. TO ADDRESS THE CHILD CARE CRISIS THE SEQUEL THEY XIN IS RECOMMENDING THE FOLLOWING. FIRST WE DO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND THE RELIEF THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED THROUGHOUT THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUDGET WE NEED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT NOT JUST FROM FEDERAL FUNDS BUT INTENTIONAL STATE FUNDS TO. WE URGE YOU TO ADOPT STRICT- INVESTMENTS TO STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND A COMPREHENSIVE CHILD CARE SYSTEM THAT IS ACCESSIBLE. AFFORDABLE EQUITABLE MEETS FAMILIES NEEDS MPS PROVIDERS A LIVING WAGE. SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. AN ONGOING FUNDING FOR CHILDCARE VOUCHERS AND SPACES THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION AND ONGOING FUNDING TO BRING THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE AND THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATES UP TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ARMAR SURVEY LEVEL. OF TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION TO WAY FAMILY FEES THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING OVER FOUR YEARS TO RESTORE THE FACILITIES AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS. THAT WOULD DEFINE IT LAST YEAR SO THAT PROVIDERS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REOPEN IT SO THAT WE CAN RECRUIT NEW PROVIDERS TO REPLACE THOSE WHO UNFORTUNATELY HAVE PERMANENTLY CLOSED. THIRTY ONE MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO MODERNIZE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS VERY FAMILY FRIENDLY SYSTEM. AND UP TO FIVE MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TO DEVELOP AN EQUITY INDEX. WHEN THE SIGNAL INFLUX OF ONE TIME GENERAL DOLLARS AND FEDERAL. FUNDS THESE ARE REASONABLE REQUEST TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA WORKING FAMILIES CAN RETURN TO WORK. AGAIN CHILDCARE PROVIDERS ARE ESSENTIAL THEY HAVE STEPPED UP TO SERVE OTHERS CENTRAL WRKERS AND HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY GOING. THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO SURVIVE BECAUSE OF BLACK IN LINE NEXT WOMEN. AND IT'S TIME THAT WE STEP OUT FOR THEM. AS YOU WORK TO BUILD A BUDGET THAT REFLECTS OUR VALUES LET'S MAKE SURE. THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE VALUE OF WOMEN'S WORK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND NOW I WILL PASS IT ON TO MY COLLEAGUE DEBORAH QUARTERLY. MY NAME IS DEBORAH QUALIFY IS THAT OKAY. YEAH I AM A MEMBER OF THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED MY DAY CARE IS OPEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK I HAVE PARENTS WHO WORK IN THE NURSING IN NINETEEN ALL DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSES AND OTHER FRONT LINE JOBS. THE THANK COLBERT NINETEEN HAS TAKEN A TOLL IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT I'VE HAD. ONE OF THE FIVE ZERO TASK PROBLEMS POSITIVE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH KEEPING MY DAYCARE ESTATE PROFITABLE HAVE BEEN A FINANCIAL STRAIN MOST OF MY DAY CARE IS TAKEN UP BY FACILITATING DISTANCE LEARNING CLASSES AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE LITTLE ONES I THANK YOU FOR KIDS. TEMPORARILY MOVED IN WITH ME BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS WORK. IN NURSING HOMES HI. THEREFORE THERE LIVES. WE GOT ONE OF MY THAT PUBLIC LEAVING BEHIND A FOR YOU OLD IN BOY THIS MAKE HAVE MADE ONE THING CLEAR ARE ALREADY WILL CHECK CARE SYSTEM WHAT THE PREPARE TO GET WITH THE THANK OVER NINETEEN CREATE DEVASTATION FOR OVER. FIVE THOUSAND FIVE THE CLOSE THERE'S BILLBOARDS. AND OVER FIFTY THOUSAND KICKED THE MOVE THE CHILD CARE I THANK ALL THE THIS TO YOU- IF YOU CAN BE SURE THAT THIS BUDGET DOES KEEP IN ONE STABILIZE CHILD. AND KILL IT DOWN. TO A STRONG. THIS INCLUDES RIGHT NOW FOR PROVIDE TO BE TO SEE OPEN DURING A DIFFICULT TIME. AND PROVIDER WHO HAVE BEEN TO CLOSE TO ME OKAY WAITING ALL FAN BE AND REIMBURSE PROVIDERS. EXTEND CURRENT CALL THE PROJECT. THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IT'S GOING YEAR INCREASE REIMBURSED RATES ANY CLOTHING. BENEFITS FOR PROVIDE THANK YOU RETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLAY TIME ALL WHAT CARE ACT THAT EIGHT PEOPLE. FINALLY THERE WOULD BE MORE DEVASTATING I'VE BEEN THAT. JOHN PROVIDERS SHOULD HAVE TO BAD AND WHEN NOT FOR HELP TO CONTINUE OFF. THE VERY OF IT STATE. BUYERS TO DO STEP UP AND THANK YOU. THANK NOTTHE THING MERRY- IT'S NOT A FROM PARENTS VOICES. YEAH THANK YOU FOR MAKE ME FOLLOW MISTER. THANK YOU- HUH I NATION'S PARENT. A DAY OF I'M OF THIS IS HAS REAL HARM THAT'S FONG FOR DOM ON THE BACKS OF BLACK AND LATINO. WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS UNDO THAT HARPER ASK IF WAIVE ALL FAMILY FEES ONE OF STARTS TO EARN A TO FIVE DOLLARS DOLLARS A MONTH IN GROSS PAY THEY START TO PAY MY FEE THEIR K. AS INCOME RIGHT THEIR FEES RISE. WE HAVE MEMBERS ARE SUCH WORKERS FORCED ONTO PAYMENTS WITH TEACHING SO THEY CAN AFFORD THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CHILD CARE FEES THEY PAY A MONTH SO THEY CAN KEEP THEIR SUBSIDY A MAGIC RISK IN A LECTURE CITY TO KEEP YOUR CHILD CARE. THERE'S A FARMWORKERS COUPLE IN FRESNO WHO SAW THEIR FEES JUMPED FROM TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH BECAUSE SCHOOLS REMAINED CLOSED THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT MOM QUIT. HER JOB AND TOOK THE KIDS OUT OF CARE. THE STATE IS CALLED. SICK ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT MILLION PER YEAR IN FEES FOR MOSTLY WORKING MOTHERS OF COLOR TO SUBSIDIZE THIS PROGRAM. IN SOME CASES CHILD CARE PROVIDERS RECEIVE LOWER PAYCHECKS AND MUST COLLECT THE FEES FROM PARENTS TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. MANY PROVIDERS RECORD THEY DON'T EVEN TAKE THE FEET BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT THE FINANCIAL TOLL IT TAKES ON THE FAMILY. AND THEN THEY SUPPRESS THEIR OWN INCOME. SIXTY MILLION AS A DROP IN THE BUCKET FOR THE STATE BUT IT'S BREAKING THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF WORKING WITH IT. YOU CAN DO THIS HARM. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN US A SHORT WINDOW TO TAKE ACTION TO WAIVE FEES FOR ALL FAMILIES THAT. THE FEES WERE WAIVED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC BUT SINCE SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THOSE USING IN PERSON CARE CONTINUE TO PAY. THOSE WERE PROTECTED US FROM THE VIRUS SHOULDN'T FEEL THE ECONOMIC PAIN OF THESE FEEDS. THE BENEFIT OF WAIVING FEES IS THAT IT'S IMMEDIATE RELIEF UNLIKE OTHER STIMULUS BENEFITS THERE'S NO APPLICATION PROCESS NO ONE CAN DENY YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TOFIND THE RIGHT DOOR OR THE RIGHT WORKER TO HELP YOU GET IT. SO WE ARE ASKING FOR YOU TO WAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. AND I'M SORRY WE ARE ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO WAIVE. THE FEES THROUGH OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE SECOND HALF IS TO MEET THE ACCESS DEMANDS OF FAMILIES WHO ARE WAITING FOR CARE. AS SCHOOLS IN THE ECONOMY RE OPENED FAMILIES WILL NEED CHILD CARE TO GET BACK TO WORK. LIST OUR KIDS OF COLOR AND THEY NEED US TO SEE THEM. THE CHOICES YOU TAKE IN THIS COMMITTEE WILL HAVE A GENERATIONAL IMPACT IF YOU DON'T ACT NOW. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDS TO EXPAND ACCESS THAT JESSICA HAD MENTIONED- WE HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH ONE TIME FUNDS. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ACUTE NEEDS OF GENERATION COPE AND URGENCY. THE KIDS BORN AND BEING RAISED DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT T. K. IN THIS HEARING BUT WE ALSO NEED SOLUTIONS FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS. WHO'VE EXPERIENCED A YEAR OF ISOLATION. PLAYGROUNDS AND PARKS CLOSE SANDBOXES ANTI AND HOW THAT IMPACTED THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND WE KNOW THAT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IS AT ITS MOST RAPID IN THE EARLIEST YEARS. BY TARGETING CHILDCARE VOUCHERS AND SLOTS AND PRIORITIZING FAMILIES WITH INFANTS AND TDDLERS. JENNIFER YOU CAN HAVE A FRESH START. GETTING INTO CHILDCARE PROGRAMS WHERE THEY CAN PLAY AND BE WITHTHEIR PEERS. WHICH COULD REVERSE THE HARM OF ISOLATION. IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO CARE OVER THREE YEARS. WE CAN FOLLOW THEM AS INFANTS AND TODDLERS AND THEN WATCH THEM ENTER. OTHER PROGRAMS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS AND KINDERGARTEN AND BEYOND. WE CAN HAVE A REAL TIME STUDY OF THE IMPACT AN INTERVENTION THAT ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE. HAD IN THEIR LIVES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO UNDO SYSTEMIC RACIAL HARM. AND TURN IT INTO HEALING AND- FAMILY SUCCESS. THANK YOU AND I WILL PASS IT. TO MY COLLEAGUE ERIC SONNENFELD. HELLO GERMAN A COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR SPENDING YOUR TIME TODAY TO DISCUSS. THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES. AS MENTIONED WITH ALL OF OUR OTHER PANEL MEMBERS THE EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM WAS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE WHEN CALLED THE NINETEEN HIT US. AND WE BARELY SURVIVED IN YOUR CURRENTLY STILL. BARELY SURVIVING AT THIS POINT. WHAT I'D LIKE TO BRING THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION TO IS. NOT AT THIS POINT FOR THE VOUCHER BASED SIDE OF THE HOUSE BILLS FOR THE SENATE SIDE. TO CONTINUE TO HOLD HARPER I WAS FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS AN AND IMMEDIATE NEED. FOR THE SERVICE WORLD. THE IMPACTS OF COOPER NINETEEN FAMILIES NOT WANTING TO BRING THEIR CHILDREN TO OUR CENTERS OR- FOR- CHILDREN WHO CANNOT ATTEND OUR CENTERS BECAUSE OF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OR STATE PUBLIC. GUIDELINES RELATED TO GROUP SIZE. SO I REALLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE LEGISLATURE. TO CONTINUE THE HOLD HARMLESS INTO 2122% BASED CONTRACTORS. WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO STABILIZE OURSELVES. ENSURE THAT WE- ARE RETURN CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TO CARE SAFELY. AND EFFECTIVELY. ALSO AS PART OF TODAY'S A CONSIDERATION IS RATE REFORM. REFORM IS A HUGE REQUIREMENT THAT IS NEEDED. BECAUSE WE REFORM FOR NOT ONLY THE BUDGET BASED SIDE WHICH WE'VE HEARD ABOUT US FIRST FOR THE SENATE BAYSIDE CREATES EQUITY. THE TWO SYSTEMS OF THE NEXT DELIVERY SYSTEM WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. REFORM IS CRUCIAL TO ANY FOUNDATIONAL CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSED EVEN IN THE MASTER PLAN OR ANY PLANLEGISLATURE MAY CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE. IT ENSURES PROPER WAGES. IT ENSURES STABILIZATION OF THE WORK FORCE IT ALSO ENCOURAGES FOLKS TO BE MAINTAINED IN THE WORK FORCE. BECAUSE WITHOUT RATE REFORM. OUR COSTS WILL EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT WE RECEIVE FOR EACH CHILD. AND WITH THE RISING COST OF MINIMUM WAGE PERSONS SPECIFICALLY- IN ELEAZAR AND IF FOR THOSE PRIVATE NONPROFITS WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT GIVING OR CURRENTLY GIVING HEALTH AND WELFARE OR RETIREMENT BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. THOSE RATE REFORMS TO HEAR IT FOR QUALITY FOR OR INCENTIVIZING FOR OTHER THINGS THAT WE ALL WANT TO FEEL IS BEDROCK. AS PART OF REFORM ALSO COLD. LEARNING RECEIVE SOMETHING MORE THAN A DIET COLA WE MUST RECEIVE RECIPROCAL. BECAUSE OUR COSTS ARE THE SAME COST AS EVERYONE ELSE'S COSTS. SO IF K. TWELVE OFFICIATING IN TWO POINT 31% INCREASE. REALLY LEARNING SHOULD RECEIVE THE SAME. WE HAVE SOME THAT SAME OF SCHOOL K. TWELVE S. WE ALSO HAVE SOME DIFFERENT OBSTACLES THAT K. TWELVE DOES NOT HAVE. ALSO WAS REMINDED COMMITTEE CHIU ENCOURAGE THE FUNDING FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN THE CCG ARE NCCPG CONTRACTS ONCE YOU SHIFT TO DSS. HAPPENS ON JULY ONE THAT IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THAT THE NEXT DELIVERY SYSTEM SERVES CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE BEST. POSSIBLE SETTING. ALSO I WANT TO REMIND THE COMMUNITY THAT INCREASE BASIS FOR THAT CONTRACT PROGRAMS THAT WERE REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE ANTICIPATED CALLED THE NINETEEN. BUDGET SHORTFALL SHOULD BE RESTORED.

S. B. P. AND THE CLERK T. K. PROGRAM TO ALLOW PARENTS TO CHOOSE IN THEIR COMMUNITY WHICH OPTION SUITS THEM BEST. UNTIL A FULL PLAN IS ROLLED OUT. AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN OVER THE BALANCE OF MY TIME TO MR NOBLE MORGAN THANK YOU. THAT LEADS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT THERE NEVER WORKING AGAIN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TO ANY GOVERNMENT. WHEN WE LOOK AT EARLY LEARNING CARE WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY NEEDS AND NOTHING ELSE IN FACT IF THE PANELISTS BEFORE ME MADE VERY COMPELLING. ME THAT CAN. HE'S SO ATHLETIC IN THE- AND- IT WOULD STAY AT THEIR- AS THEY TOLD US ABOUT THE IMPACT IN THEIR OWN PROGRAMS AND ON THEIR OWN FAMILIES. I'VE ALREADY DISPATCHED THEM IN THE NEEDS ARE CONTRACTORS THAT SHARED RELATED TO COVET NINETEEN RESPONSES. AND ONCE AGAIN ECHOING THE PRIOR PANELISTS. INCLUDE WAITING TO BE IN THE TEENS EXTENDING THE HOLD HARMLESS FOR DIRECT CONTRACTED PROGRAMS INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. AND ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS OR OTHER MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT THE ENTIRE FIELD SAID THAT WE ALSO SUPPORT THE PRIVATE MARKET. BUT AS WE LOOK TO THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE AND WE FOCUS ON STABILIZING AT RIGHT NOW WE ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS. THAT RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES PROVIDE THE FOUNDATIONAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE IN THE EARLY YEARS. LINKED TO CLOSING OPPORTUNITY AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT FUELS THE INEQUITIES ACROSS THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND BEYOND. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH BY WESTON ED IN UC BERKELEY BEAR HAS FOUND THAT CHILDREN AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. IN ESTATE THAT'S RATED AT FIVE UNDER THE QUALITY COUNTS CALIFORNIA READING MATH MATRIX EXHIBIT GREATER LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT THANK THOSE IN TIER FOUR TIER THIRTY PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL DESIRED RESULTS DEVELOPMENTAL PROFILE. ARE DEAR TO KEEP GETTING. THEIR RESEARCH ALSO CLEARLY INDICATES THAT ARE TO ONE LANGUAGE LEARNERS BENEFITED THE MOST. AND IT WAS AN ENORMOUS INCREASE FROM ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF QUALITY CALIFORNIA STATE. OPERA GRAHAM SPECIFICALLY THEY FOUND THAT GAPS IN LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT WERE NEAR OUR FOR DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS IN ITS HEREBY BENDING EACH YEAR THROUGH THE PROGRAM. THIS MEANS THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS MEET THOSE RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS IT YOU CAN REACH THOSE HIGHER LEVELS OF QUALITY AND REALLY SUPPORT ALL OF OUR EARLIEST LEARNERS. MEASURE TO BACKSEAT ON THE CALIFORNIA'S DECREASED COPART RAN WITH YOUR OFFICES TO THIS HEARING. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES. TO LEVERAGE ACCESS TO HIGH THE RESULT TO EQUITY CHILDREN AND PARTS. WE ROUGHLY THAT'S HUNDRED THOUSAND DREAM YEAR OLDS ARE A LITLE TO SEE. P. TWENTY SEVEN PER OF THE ELIGIBLE THREE FOUR YEAR OLD. ARE SERVED IN IT ONE NINETEEN S. OR SERVE OTHER EARLY MORNING SO SETTING. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH WANT TO LOOK AT DATA TO DRIVE. AND- PROGRAMS. HE OF THIS WILL BE A THE YES KEEP KEEP RATES I WASN'T AS AT HAD A BIT TO TALKING DIET. COLOR. BENTSEN DOWN OUR PANEL IS THE FTP RAY IS FAR BEHIND FIFTY K. RATE AND THE REGIONAL MARKETS RIGHT. WHEN WE FOR WORST THAT I CHILDREN ARE IN THE STATE. THE ESTIMATE AT DAILY REACH MARKET R. INCLUDING YOUR- COSTS REPORTS CARE. FOR A SPAN BASED RECENTLY CHINA THE ARE IS THIRTY FOUR FOR HI.

PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE PART DATE YES KEEP. STATE STANDARD REIMBURSED RIGHT FASTER JUST SO. THAT AS WE LOOK AT A- THAT'S WHAT TO MEET STILL. AS WELL AS DO BUSINESS WITH THE STATE WHICH MEANS INCREASE JUST NOT COST. THAT THERE MAY DOES NOT SUPPORT. INDEED TO YES HE AND G. K. SUPPORT. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ENHANCE FUNDING THE EARLY AT. PROGRAM WHICH IS ARTICLE MORE AND PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE IS THIS BUDGET ABOUT YEARS WHEN THE BY. BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO YOUR TO ME WE HAVE FORTY TWO APPLICANTS ARE ABLE FIND AT. AND I WHO WERE EIGHT TO HER. THE IS NEEDED AVAILABLE PLANS BY- OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION AND EVEN OUR CURRENT. ARE NOW FLANK THAT THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL SYSTEM EQUIPMENT AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AS THEY MISTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR GRANTS BUT THEY'RE ALSO ABLE TO SHARE WITH US HOW THEY ARE CREATING MORE INCLUSIVE PROGRAMS AND SUPPORTING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WITH AN EXCITING. BUT THERE ARE OTHER. TYPICALLY DEVELOPING PEERS. I AS WE AT X. AND REALLY SUPPORT YES HE- AND THE REST THIS EARLY LEARNING AND CARE SYSTEM. WE ASK ARE THOSE WHO WERE DRESSED THE NEEDS OF THE WORKFORCE PATHWAYS BROWN AND- PROVIDING ADDITIONAL. IN THE- AS WELL AS THE THIS NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE. WHEN WE WANT TO MAKE AT ANOTHER PLUG FOR THAT AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND SAFETY PROGRAMS EXIST WHICH AS I SHARED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. WHAT HEARD AND OUR MASTER PLAN PIECE IN USING A MODIFIED ASUS RICHIE KEITA THIRD AS A WAY TO ENSURE FULL pUNIVERSAL THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS BY LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. OTHER SUPPORT. THAT ALL I HAVE FOR YOU TODAY BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- FALL START OFFERED FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE FIELD AND SO THANK YOU TO THE FOR THE FIRST TIME WELL ALL THE SPEAKERS BUT SPECIALLY THE FIRST THAT THREE WHO WHO HAVE YOU KNOW VOICES FROM REALLY THE TRENCHES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I ANT TO ASK THE THIRD QUESTION HERE AND ON THE AGENDA WHICH HOPEFULLY WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL CENTER LEYVA TOOK UP HER. BILL REFER REFORMING THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES- THIS MORNING AND AS WE KNOW WE HAD THAT I HAD THE BILL AST YEAR AND WE TEND TO DO SOME OF THAT IN THE BUDGET. SO WE WANT TO ASK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DIDN'T MAKE. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON MODERATE REFORM. AND CONTINUED WITH THE EXISTING ARE MARIN S. R. OUR RATES IN CALIFORNIA. FOR. THE NEGATIVE JUDGMENTS NOT AS WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN BUT JUST HYPOTHETICAL WAY. THE CHAIRPERSON THIS IS OUR TIME FELT LIKE COUNTS EDUCATION AS A CURRENT CONTRACT FOR. IF DE UM S. R. R. IS NOT ADJUSTED OR EVEN THE HALLMARKS NOT JUST IT- FUTURE COSTS WILL OUTSTRIP OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR PROGRAMS CURRENTLY WE HAVE ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS. IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE OPERATE- WE WOULD HAVE TO SIGNIFICANT LOOK AT. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE SERVING THAT NUMBER OF CHILDREN. AS OUR COSTS INCREASE. IN THIS IS THEIR LEVEL WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE THINK WE NEED ARISE AND RELINQUISHMENT L. AS MR SONNENFELD JUST SUGGESTED THAT AS CONTRACTORS CAN'T AFFORD TO OPERATE THAT THE FTP PROGRAM ANYMORE DAVID RELINQUISH IT WHICH MEANS WE WOULD LOSE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL. IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES WE ALSO KNOW THAT THAT HAS PLAYED INTO THE LACK OF ABILITY TO TAKE UP THAT TIME AS WE RESTART THESE OVER THE YEARS THAT PROGRAMS FOR THE STRUGGLE WITH KNOWING THAT IF THEY ACCEPT THAT AND TAKE ON A CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT BUT THEY WILL THAT STRUGGLE TO ACTUALLY OPERATE IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COME CLOSE. TO COVERING THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. IT CAN ALSO NAY YES FOR FAMILY GATE IT FROM DAY FOR. HAVE MINIMUM WAGE CONTINUES TO RISE FAMILY DAYCARE PROVIDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR ASSISTANCE THEREFORE DON'T BE MORE. MORE QUALIFIED PROVIDERS LEADING THE FIELD SO THAT HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON FAMILY DAYCARE. AND THE CHILDREN THAT WE SERVE FOR THE STATE. OKAY THANK YOU I WANT TO OWN IT- ASK ONE MORE QUESTION HERE AND THEN I'LL LEVINE I ASK THIS QUESTION A LAST PANEL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND- DIDN'T GET A SATISFACTORY ELIGIBLE ANSWERS LOOKING FOR BUT THEY HAVE A JOB TO DO SO I ASSUME THAT WE WILL GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER HERE- LAST YEAR WE HAD OVER TWO YEARS AGO WE FOCUSED ON INCREASING MONEY FOR FACILITIES. AND PROFESSION OF ELEMENT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE TOOK THAT TOOK THAT MONEY. OUT WHAT WAS THE OUT COMMERCE SINCE A LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE FACILITIES STOLLER'S AS WELL AS- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. RESOURCES. SO LET'S START WITH CDCR DOUBLE MORGAN WITH THE TASK LET'S ASK YOU TO ADDRESS THAT. THANK YOU CHAIR. I THINK I HIGHLIGHTED IT BRIEFLY WE ACTUALLY KNOW THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF DEMAND FOR THE FACILITIES GRANT THAT WE WERE WORKING ON AND WE HAD GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE ABOUT TO RELEASE THAT. WHEN WE KNEW THAT THE FUNDS WERE GOING TO BE SCRAPPED ANY RESPECT FOR A REALLY GOOD REASON WE UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL SITUATION THE STATE BUT IN LAST YEAR. IT'S JUT THAT THE FISCAL STATE TURNING AROUND AND LOOKING VERY DIFFERENT CURRENTLY WE THOUGHT THAT'S A REALLY CRITICAL AREA TO INVEST IN AND KNOW THAT EVEN WITH THE FUNDS THAT WERE DEDICATED TO IT THAT DEMAND WAS ANY EXCEED THAT AVAILABILITY. WOULD SAY THE SAME FOR THE WORKFORCE. PATHWAYS GRANT AND WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE WHAT WAS FORMALLY CALLED EACH. AND FUNDED BY CTR QUALITY FANS AND TRANSFORMED THAT SAID THAT IT WAS MORE AFFORDABLE AND MORE PROGRAMS GET ACCESS IT BUT IT WAS ONLY TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT DOESN'T NEARLY MEET THE NEEDS OF WHAT THE DEMOCRATS. AND I THINK I WILL. ALSO CHEST KNOWING THAT. ALL OF OUR- AND ALL OF OUR- NEED ADDITIONAL. THE WORKFORCE. DIDN'T ADDRESS COME. BUT DID PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORTS INCREASED. KNOWLEDGE EXPERTISE. AND ACCESS TO BOTH HIGH QUALITY TRAINING APPRENTICESHIP MODELS. AND ACTUAL UNIT SAID THAT PROVIDERS COULD GO ON AND GET A DEGREE. AND AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS IN THE MASTER PLAN. AROUND A UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL SYSTEM ONE OF THE COMPONENTS IS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS. ALSO COME UP AND MEET THE SAME STANDARDS. SO FOR THE FIELD TO MEET THE SAME STANDARDS WE WILL NEED TO INVEST IN THE WORK FORCE. TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN THEN MOVE THAT'S. IN NEED THOSE HIGHER STANDARDS. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S MY FINAL QUESTION SO REMEMBER BY ADONIS- I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION HERE RATHER IT MIGHT BE MORE OF A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT IF ANYBODY WANTS TO WEIGH IN- HOW CAN SOME OF WHICH I THINK ARE REAL THESE REALLY GREAT BUDGET REQUESTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS- HOW CAN THEY HELP MAKE CHILD CARE MORE AFFORDABLE. FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS BECAUSE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT- THE OUR MOST VULNERABLE OR LOW INCOME FAMILIES- SPECIAL NEEDS- ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BUT WHAT I THINK WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE DEEPLY ENOUGH IS THAT THE REALITY THAT FOR MANY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES THEY MADE TOO MUCH MONEY TO QUALIFY FOR ANY STATE AID OR LOCAL COUNTY AID. BUT THEY DON'T MAKE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD YOU KNOW FIVE SIX TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CHILD CARE OR PRESCHOOL BUT- FEES SO HOW DID THESE REQEST AND HOW ARE WE FOCUSED ON HOW CAN WE FOCUS ON WHAT RECOMMENDATION RENT RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE. TO MAKE CHILD CARE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. HI THIS IS MARY- WITH PEP BOYS THE ALL TAKE A STAB- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN YOU'VE ASKED INCREDIBLE QUESTIONS AND WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE YOU ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS WELL- I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE FACE IS. AND THAT'S HOW I STARTED MY PRESENTATION WHICH SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED THE SYSTEM FOR FAR TOO LONG AND SO WE HAD TO MAKE CHOICES. ON WHO. YOU KNOW IS QUOTE UNQUOTE DESERVING AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS A INDICATION THAT. THEY WANT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE FOR ALL FAMILIES AND SO WE'RE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE. MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS COME IN AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL OF LONG TERM FUNDING TO SUPPORT CHILD CARE FOR FAMILIES WHO MAKE UP TO- SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF A HUNDRED AND 50% OF ESTIMATES. AND THAT WOULD REALLY CAPTURE A LOT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT. BUT UNTIL WE GOT THOSE FEDERAL INVESTMENTS IN UNTIL WE GET THE REAL STATE INVESTMENTS. TO BOND THE SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SPACES AND AT LEAST WITH OUR FAMILY FEE PROPOSAL- THAT IS ABOUT MAKING CHILD CARE AFFORDABLE FOR ALL FAMILIES. AND EVENTUALLY FOR FAMILIES WHO STAY ON LONGER AT THE HIGHER AND- WE WOULD NOT. WE WOULD ASK FOR NOTE THAT THEY WOULD NOT CHARGE MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME. AND THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP IT AFFORDABLE FOR ALL FAMILIES AND SO. AS WE GET THIS MOMENTUM BACK FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL WILL BE ABLE TO REACH MORE FAMILIES KEEP IT AFFORDABLE. AND STOP. YOU KNOW HAVING TO MAKE THESE HARD CHOICES AROUND DO WE YOU KNOW INCREASE WAGES FOR PROVIDERS OR DO WE INCREASE AND. MAKE CHILD CARE MORE AFFORDABLE. THEY YOU GREAT GREAT. AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF- THE PROVIDERS ON TODAY HAVE SHARED WITH US THEY'VE- I'VE BEEN THERE I'VE SHARED YOUR STRUGGLE AND I'M COMMITTED- TO THIS BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS. THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SOCIETY SO I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY. THANK YOU AYE I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP AND MAYBE AT- FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION. AND MAYBE S. SARAH NEVER MORGAN TWO TWO ADDRESSES SO. YEAH THAT'S A CONTINUED ISSUE THAT WE FACE IN THIS COMMITTEE WHETHER IT'S THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP EARLY EDUCATION. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE- THEY'RE THERE TO- RICH TO AFFORD THE FREE BUT THEY'RE TOO POOR TO PAY A THOUSAND BUCKS A MONTH WHICH IS WHAT IT COSTS TO GO TO UCLA THE SAME THING AS A PRE K. PROGRAM ITSELF. IF YOU'RE A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY LIVE IN A HIGH COST AREA. I USED TO SAY ALL THE OTHER AREAS LIKE SOCAL IN THE BAY AREA BUT NOW HERE IN SACRAMENTO YOU CAN. BE A FAMILY MAKING IT OUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR MORTGAGE AND ALL YOUR BILLS AND EVERYTHING YOU DON'T HAVE THAT EXTRA MONEY SO ONE THING THAT WE TRY TO DO TWO YEARS AGO WE STARTED LAST YEAR IS IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. IF YOUR IN THAT I THINK WE CALL THE CATCHMENT AREA LIKE IF YOU'RE IN A- IN THE AREA THAT'S HIGH. CONCENTRATION OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS THANK YOU EVERYBODY FROM THAT AREA WOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND THAT WOULD SAVE ON THE PAPERWORK TO. SO IT'S NOT A PANACEA BECAUSE MAYBE THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS BUT WE THINK IF YOU LOOK UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA. THOSE ARE THE AREAS WHERE YOU COULD YOU COULD REACH. A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT MAKE JUST TOO MUCH TO BECOME ELIGIBLE. FOR STATE PRESCHOOL AND THE AND THE FRUSTRATING THING AS WELL IS THAT EVERY YEAR. WE WOULD PUT MONEY BACK YOU KNOW ONE THE MOST DISAPPOINTING ABOUT THIS JOB. IS DONE CHILD CARE AND KEPT CAL GRANT EVERY YEAR IT'S LIKE FELT NOT ENOUGH WE'RE GONNA SEND IT OVER HERE SO I ALWAYS THINK THAT MONEY IS GOING TO. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT SO. IT'S BEEN TO FOR YOU KNOW HELPING MAKE SURE WE SERVE MORE KIDS BUT ALSO. THE KIDS TO FAMILIES WHO JUST MISSED OUT SO BUT IF WE DO THE TRANSITION A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN OF COURSE. THOSE MONIES- AND THAT ELIGIBILITY WILL BE FOR EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF INCOME BUT CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THOUGH- SERRA THAT. IF UNDER THE EXISTING. SYSTEM PROGRAM AND IF WE SWITCHED THE THAT WAS TO COVER FOR ALL SIX. THREE YEAR OLD. WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THAT POLICY IN THAT CATCHMENT AREA. AND ALLOW MORE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. BOTH PART DAY AND FULL DAY. THAT IS CORRECT THAT ADMINISTRATORS STARTED THIS IS THEIR NUMBER WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IT HE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE COULD BANG DECIDE TO HAVE THIS FUNDS CONTINUE IN STATE PRESCHOOL AND CONTINUE WITH THE EXPANSION THAT WAS STARTED LAST YEAR. SO BEYOND THAT CATCHMENT AREAS THE MASTER PLAN ALSO CALLED OUT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. AND WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT CHILDREN WITH. INDIVIDUAL FAMILY SERVICE PLAN AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLANS. SO THAT. YOUNG OLDER TWO GIRLS IS THE TRANSITION FROM AN IFSC TO AN I. E. P. IN THE SYSTEM. THE THAT ELIGIBILITY AND ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE PROGRAM WOULD CREATE AS THE SPACE. WITH EARLY INTERVENTION COMPONENTS TO RELEASE THE COURT FOUND. THAT WE WOULD EXPAND RECOMMEND EXPANDING BOTH BY CONTINUING THE CATCHMENT AREA. AND ALSO INCLUDING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AS AN AUTOMATIC ELIGIBILITY AND THAT FITS WITH THE MASTER PLAN ALSO. YEAH AND JUST TO CLARIFY WE WOULD HAVE TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT IN STATE LAW IT IT. IT WOULD IT WOULD HAVE TO THE NO CHANGES WOULD BE NEEDED JUST. CONTINUAL WHAT THE CURRENT LAW IS. RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR THE I'M THE PRESENT. THIS WAS VERY. AND WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPENED AND CERTAINLY REVISIT. THIS WITH THAT ROBUST EASY PACKAGE FROM THE ASSEMBLY AFTER THE MAY REVISE. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE FINAL ISSUE THE DAY THIS IS RELATED TO A TRANSITIONING CHILD CARE. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. SOWE'RE GONNA START WITH BERMAN SOCIAL SERVICES- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND FINALLY THE L. A. L.

TO CARE BEING RECEIVED INTO THE PROVIDERS THAT BACK HERE- AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSITIONS THAT WE ARE HOLDING THAT AND THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WE DO ALSO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO INTEGRATE THE SYSTEM AND TO BUILD ON OUR SUCCESSES. WHERE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH CDP ROUTE THIS TRANSITION AS DIRECTOR JOHNSON MENTIONED. AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INTERNAL WORKGROUPS. AB CD HAS BEEN DOING A NUMBER OF WALK THROUGHS FOR US OF. HE DETAILED LEVEL SO THAT CAN BE READY TO OPERATIONAL DUTIES AS OF JULY ONE AND IN SOME CASES EVEN AND PREPARING FOR THAT BEFORE HIM.

TO PROVIDE THAT FINAL PLAN ON TIME AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO REFLECT THE COMMENTS. THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING- WHAT WE DO ALSO. HAVE THE OF THE APPOINTMENT OUR- TO.

DR BUFFET HIGH MAY MYLAN IS JOINING US WITH THAT RICH AND DEEP AND LONG HISTORY IN THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FIELD AND WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE HER- ONBOARD NOW. AS WE PREPARE FOR JULY ONE- AS THE DIRECTOR ALSO MENTIONED HE DID PREVIOUS- TRAILER BILL EARLIER THIS WEEK AND IS AT IT IS VOLUMINOUS IN THE NUMBER OF PAGES BUT AB. TECHNICAL IN NATURE SO THAT TRAILER BILL IS- ACCOMPLISHING THE MOVE OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CODES AND STATUTES FROM THE EDUCATION CODE TO THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE.

SO WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE WITH WITH ALL OF YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE COMPLETELY PREPARED FOR SMOOTH OPERATIONS- IN ADVANCE OF AND ON JULY ONE AND THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR SPECTACLES. THE FUTURE AFTER JULY. TO THAT END THEY TO WANT TO OPERATE OPPORTUNITY FOR MY- AND CHAT. IS OUR G. OPERATING OFFICER SHARE JUST A COUPLE OF KEY KEY HIGHLIGHTS ON A FEW OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE TRANSITION AS WELL. GOOD AFTERNOON. SALINAS CHARITY PROPERTY OFFICER I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE A COUPLE CRITICAL AREAS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH DVD THE TRANSITION PLANNING- AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE IMMEDIATE PRIORITY FOR US IS THE CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS PARTICULARLY THE SERVICES FOR FAMILIES AND TIMELY CONTRACTS AND PAYMENTS. TO SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE AND ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO DISTRACTION SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH DEFEAT TO IDENTIFY SCHEDULES OR TIMELY AND SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THOSE CONTRACTS HAEMANTHUS. REPORTING AND OTHER RELATED REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS IDENTIFYING WHAT IT WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT PROCESS NEEDS TO COMPLETE THE BUDGET CYCLES WITHOUT DESTRUCTION. AT THE LATEST UPDATE IS THAT OUR CONTRACT RENEWAL LANGUAGE HAVE BEEN DRAFTED TO REFLECT THAT RESPONSIBILITY TRANSFERRING TO SEE CSS. AND IS CURRENTLY IN THE REVIEW PROCESS WITH THE REQUIRED OVERSIGHT AGENCIES. SO WE- ANTICIPATE THAT CONTRACT WILL BE EXECUTED ON TIME FOR JULY ONE AND THAT CONTRACTORS WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE HIM IN DANCES AS THEY USUALLY DO. THE OTHER CRITICAL TO EMPHASIZE IS R. I. T. T. SYSTEMS SO WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL FOR THE CONTINUITY OF THE OPERATIONS OF BOTH DEPARTMENTS. DO YOU HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTING DATA SYSTEMS AND OUR CONTRACTORS DIRECTLY INPUT DATA INTO THE SYSTEMS AS WELL. SO WHILE THE I. T. SYSTEMS NEED TO REMAIN AT THE EACH INSURE THAT THERE'S NO DISTRACTIONS WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON DATA SYSTEMS ACCESS. AND TESTING TO ENSURE THAT THE STOCK THAT ARE TRANSFERRING OVER PROCEED WOULD HAVE REMOTE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEMS AND ABLE TO PERFORM. AT THE DATA AND CONTRACT PROCESSING AND THEY USUALLY DO. AT HOME SO I'M I'M- SO I WILL LET IT UP QUESTIONS OR IT OVER TO THE NEXT MOST YES NEXT PLEASE. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON YET AGAIN TEARS MEMBER HAS THEIR NUMBER MORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. OVER THE LAST YEAR THE CITY HAS BEEN CORDONING THE CDS THAT TO DETERMINE HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE TRANSITION WHILE MINIMIZING DISRUPTION TO CHILDREN FAMILY AND OUR PROGRAMS AND CONTRACTORS. BEFORE I GET AGAIN I HAVE TO GIVE A REALLY HUGE THANKS AND KUDOS TO MY CD TEAM WITHOUT THEM AND THEIR DEEP DEDICATION TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES MANIFEST WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. THEY ARE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT TO REALLY ADDRESS ALL OF THE NEEDS DESPITE NOT RECEIVING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE TRANSITION HE HAS COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT TIME AND ATTENTION TO SUPPORTING IT. I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY COTTON PIECES WE'VE DONE AROUND THAT TREND SESSION TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THE WORK. IN SOME INSTANCES STAFF HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO A 3240% INCREASE IN WORKLOAD TO ACCOMMODATE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PLAN AND EXECUTE THE TRANSITION. WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING THE PRIORITIES RELATED TO THE TO THE PANDEMIC AND GETTING ADDITIONAL FUNDS OUT TO THE FIELD. AND RECEIVING A NEARLY 10% HE KEPT THEMSELVES. OVER ARCHING AT CD WE HAVE SHARED HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS AND HOSTED DOZENS OF MEETINGS IN AN EFFORT TO GET CDS THAT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AND SYSTEMS TRANSITIONING. ACTIVE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MORE SPECIFICALLY CDS DEVELOPED MATERIALS AND JOINED AND PRESENTED AT MORE THAN SIXTY CREAMY. WALK THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND PRIVATE MEETINGS ON A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES WE'VE IDENTIFIED DEVELOPED AND PROVIDED NEARLY A THOUSAND FILES THAT INCLUDE PROCEDURES MANUALS PROCESS THESE. CHARTS TRAINING AND A COMPREHENSIVE TRANSITION INVENTORY THAT IDENTIFIES AND DESCRIBES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE SERVICES AND FUNCTIONS AND INCLUDES OVER A HUNDRED NEEDING ONE ATTACHMENT. PROCESS EVEN RESOURCES. I DIPLOMA ABOUT MISS CHANCES WE MIGHT TO AREAS WHERE AN INNER. AGREEMENT ARMOR ENGINE FUNDERS. MAYBE NOT NEED TO MAKE TO. SIX POST JULY. ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA WITH THE THAT MAY NOT BE TO IMPLEMENT IN TERMS OF DATA AND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION CITY KERR. AND CAN TO THE TRANSITION THE ENCINITAS THAT'S RECENTLY POSTED AS WELL AS TO THE ORDERLY TRANSITION REPORT. ONLY PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THAT SHRINK THEIR BALANCE AS WELL AS PROVIDING OUR OWN TO ENSURE THAT THAT COMPONENTS RELATED DISTINCT SPEAKER PROGRAM REMAINS IN EDUCATION BECAUSE- I. WORKS WITH THE TRANSITION TOGETHER WITH CDS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS WHERE DECISIONS IN OUR SOLUTION STILL NEEDING I WOULD. CSS WITH A KEY DECISION DOCUMENT WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM I FEEL LIKE THEY PROBABLY SAY WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THESE HIGH LEVEL SOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS. IT SEEMS THAT EVERY TIME THEY LAND ON ONE DECISION THERE'S ABOUT FIVE TO MORE MAYBE TWENTY THINGS THAT ARE. UNDERNEATH THAT THAT THAT HAVE TO BE DECIDED. THEY WILL WORK. THIRTY TWO TWO DEPARTMENTS AFTER THE TRANSITION. THAT- SO THOSE DECISIONS ON HOW TO DETERMINE THE WHICH TO PARK WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENTS THE BEGINNING OF THE TRANSITION THOSE ARE ALL KEEPING THAT WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH. ANOTHER ISSUE STILL PENDING BECAUSE WHICH DEPARTMENT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL REPORTING FOR THE FIRST FISCAL YEAR AS THESE EXPENDITURES WILL CROSS THE STATE FISCAL YEARS AND FEDERAL FISCAL YEARS. ANOTHER CHALLENGE THAT THE TRANSITION IS THAT CURRENT THE CONTRACTORS TRANSFER FUNDS BETWEEN THEIR CTR WHICH- INFANT TODDLER IN SCHOOL AGE DIRECT CONTACT IT PROGRAMS AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE SCHOOL. PROGRAM CONTRACTS. IN THE- GEN THIS YEAR HE WILL BE WITH. AND THAT'S EASY TO WILL BE THE YEAR THAT. INVOLVED DISCUSSION WITH THE OF FINANCE AND CDS. THAT VEHICLE A LOT TO CAR AFTER THAT TRANSIT HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED. ADDITIONAL THERE ARE CONCERN ABOUT PROGRAM AND NOT PART OF FEDERAL YEAR. WHICH ENDS SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH AND THE NECESSARY YEAR AND ACTIVITY. FINALLY WE WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU GET ANOTHER AND ADDRESSED ITEM WHICH IS HELLO THIS DCF QUALITY PLANS CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. AFTER THE TRANSITION YES HE REPRESENTS ABOUT 42% CALIFORNIA'S SUBSIDIZED EARLY NOT CONSISTENT SO WE FELT THAT IT'S CRITICAL THAT CD HAS A PORTION OF THE SCENE. YEAH ALL THE PLANS THAT CAN THEN BE DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING THE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT SO MANY OF CALIFORNIANS YOUNG CHILDREN. WE KNOWS THE STP WILL CONTINUE TO NEED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CHILD ASSESSMENTS THE PRESCHOOL LEARNING FOUNDATIONS AND OTHER RESOURCES. SB YEAH QUALITY FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED TO SEE EACH IN NINETEEN THAT SUPPORTS THIS YES HE WILL MEET ANOTHER FUNDING SOURCE TO ENSURE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESOURCES. THAT SUPPORT ALIGNMENT TO WORKING A GARDEN STANDARDS. GOVERNING CONTINUE. I A RESULT OF THESE OUT I. AND AS WE HAVE TIME WORK THROUGH THE TRANS AND IS WHAT TEACHER. SIXTEEN PROGRAM. AND A HUNDRED NINETY STAFF ANOTHER STATE A- WE SHARE SOME THAT CONCERN TO THE- ABOUT CONTINUE THAT THAT. AS IT'S CURRENTLY NAMED ESPECIALLY AROUND ISSUES RELATING TO THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE STATE'S FISCAL PROGRAM AND THE GENERAL CHILD CARE OR C. C. R. PROGRAMMING. AS WELL AS THE CHILD I DON'T CARE THE PROGRAM AND THE SEVEN OTHER CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS. OVERALL DIRECT CONTRACTED PROGRAMS ARE ADMINISTERED VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN BACHELOR PROGRAMS AND HELPED ME EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS. THANKS THE TRANSITION AND SPLIT UP DIRECT SERVICE PROGRAMS MORE BURDENSOME FOR THOSE IN THE FIELD THAT ADMINISTERS THE SB THREE PLUS ANOTHER DIRECT CONTRACT PROGRAM. THE NEED TO REPORT AND BY DEDUCTIBLES ET NCSS. AND IT'S ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE STATE AND STATE STAFF RESOURCES WILL BE NEEDED TO SUPPORT. PROGRAMS AROUND MONITORING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AT. POSTI IN CDS THAT. THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THE INABILITY TO FULLY TRANSPARENT HAD START. PARTNERSHIP AS IT'S A- FEDERAL. SPENCER OF BEING TO DO CITY IS THAT. WILL HAVE TO AND IN TO WIN AMONG. IN ORDER FOR CD TO CONTINUE OPERATING IT. RATHER THAN NEEDING TO RELINQUISH THE GRANT AND HAVE OTHERS COMPETITIVELY UP THANKS FOR. MOVING INTO THE STATE COMPONENT AT THE TRANSITION AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. CD WILL NEED SIGNIFICANT STAFF RESOURCES TO CONTINUE OUR CURRENT EVENT MODIFIED SUPPORTS TO OUR CONTRACTORS. WHILE MANY PROGRAMS WILL BE TRANSITIONING TO CDS THAT. AS WELL AS THE MATCH ASK MAJORITY AT THIS CD EIGHTEEN ADMINISTERING THE EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS. CITY WHAT ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT 90% OF ITS CURRENT CONTRACTORS. WILL HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE CONTRACTORS THAT IMPLEMENTS THE S. B. HE- DOWN FROM THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY NINE CURRENTLY THAT WE START. SIMILARITY ABOUT FROM THAT THIRTY THREE HUNDRED LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND CONTRACTORS. OPERATE OUR FEDERAL CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS THIS CD WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT NEARLY TWO THOUSAND. AT THOSE THIRTEEN. OVER TWELVE THOUSAND MEALS AT. OVER TWELVE THOUSAND YOUNG SITES. IN ADDITION BECAUSE MANY CRACKS WILL HAVE RELATIONS WITH BOTH CD AND CD. OKAY WHAT NEW RELATED TO. THE MONEY DATA SHARING A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACROSS OUR TO STATE AGENCIES. DECISIONS TRANSFERRING TO THE CDS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED YOU DEFINING AND CONNECTION. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS ON THERE WAS AROUND MY WITH CD STILL NEED THEM. THE MAJORITY OF THE POSITIONS THAT HAVE SUPPORTED OUR EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE CEO OR THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT. AND NOT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED TO TRANSFER TO CBS THAT THE MAJORITY OF STATE OPERATION FUNDING FOR ALL OF THAT REALLY KEEN FOR NAPPIES AND SUPPORTED BUT CHILD CARE YEAH YES THE- SERVICE DIRECTLY WE HAVEN'T HAD MUCH GENERAL FUND IN THIS PART OF THE SYSTEM. THE SAME PER THE CNCF HE ARE THEIR CHILD ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM THE FEDERAL STATE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT THE COLLECTIVE OF THE MEAL PROGRAMS THAT CD HAS BEEN OPERATING SAID THAT TRANSITION AND IT WAS OUT THE CHILD ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM TO BE A STANDALONE. AND IT SPENDING THAT HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THE MONITORING OF ALL OF THIS OTHER MEAL PROGRAMS THAT CD IS. THAT CORRECT. THANK YOU SO FOR THAT HAVE ITS ARTISTIC TODAY. AND AT. THAT SPEAKER GOES I'M HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THEY YOU LASTLY A LA WHICH I KNOW HOW SOME. COMMENTS THIS- IS. THANK IT AFTER AGAINST QUIRKS LEGISLATE ANALYST OFFICE SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES- SHIFTING THREE BILLION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE FROM SEAT TO SEAT YES ASK THE BUDGET ALSO SHIPS THIRTY TWO MILLION AND STATE OPERATIONS PROCEED TO BE ACCESS AND LASTLY THE BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES THIRTEEN MILLION I'M GOING GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL SOME OF THE POSITIONS BEING PROPOSED TO TRANSFER TO DEATH. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT STAFF TO MINISTER THE PROGRAM FOR ME TO EAT WITH A LOCAL STATE OPERATIONS. BEING SHIFTED TO THE S. WE THAT TO DATE THERE A LOT OF UNKNOWN IN. ABOUT TREND OR THE MINUTE THE- TO SIX ADMINISTERED ITS PROGRAMS BY JULY FIRST FOR EXAMPLE THE FULL COST OF THE TRANSITION RIGHT. ARE UNCLEAR OF THE MINISTRATION NOTED IT'S CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE RESOURCES AND STAFFING NEEDED. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE COSTS WE ARE AWARE OF. THE THIRTEEN MILLION TO BACK FILL POSITIONS ACCEDI E. ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED. GIVEN THAT INCLUDES SEEDS- THE COST OF THE PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION TO LAST YEAR DUE TO COST CONCERNS. THE LAST THING WE NOTE REGARDING THE COST OF THE PROPOSAL IS THAT THESE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BUT BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF STATE ADMINISTRATION. BUT NOT HAVING THAT ADMINISTRATION HAPPENING WITHIN. THE HAVING BUT WITH THAT ADMINISTRATION HAPPENING WITHIN A DIFFERENT STATE. THE COSTS ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS. TO STATE LEVEL ADMINISTRATION. BUT WE RECKON THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THIS TWENTY OF OUR OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. YOU THERE FOR WE KNOW SO FAR THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO RECONSIDER CONTINUING WITH THE TRANSITION PLAN AND HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS. THE FIRST OPTION IS TO STOP THE TRANSITION THE LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE TRANSITIONING CHILDCARE AND CFCF FEATURED YES THAT. IS NO LONGER A PRIORITY AND THIS WOULD FREE UP THIRTEEN MILLION AN ONGOING GENERAL AND RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THE SECOND OPTION IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE- IT COULD DELAY THE TRANSITION SO THIS WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO FOCUS ITS ENTIRE INTENTION ON THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. AND PLAN FOR THE TRANSITION ON A SLOWER TIME LINE. WE CAN DELAY THE TRANSITION UNTIL YEAR AFTER THE CALL THE NINETEEN EMERGENCY DECLARATION HAS ENDED WOULD BE A REASONABLE APPROACH. THE THIRD OPTION IS TO MODIFY THE SCOPE OF TRANSITION. THE LEGISLATURE COULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS. YES ASK IF THE LEGISLATURE TAKES THIS APPROACH WE RECOMMEND KEEPING CA CFP ACCEDE GIVEN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SHIFTING THIS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY. AND THE LEGISLATURE COULD FURTHER MINIMIZE THE SCOPE OF THE TRANSITION BY ALSO SHIFTING CERTAIN CHILD CARE PROGRAMS GSS SUCH AS- JUST SHIFTING POWERS CHANNEL CHRISTY JUST TWO AND THREE WITH THE REST OF THE CHILD CARE PROGRAM FOR ME AT THE E. TAKING A SMALLER SET OF PROGRAMS COULD BE MAPPED MORE MANAGEABLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS MAINTAINING THE SAME LEVEL OVERSIGHT. HAS AND WE HAVE SINCE MORE TECHNICAL ORIENTED RECOMMEND THAT OUR IN HOUSE TO THE END. THE LAST THING WE KNOW. WELL OUR ANALYSIS WAS COUPLE BEFORE ADMISSION REALLY EXTRA. THE PLAN WE WERE THE DRAFT PLAN IN REMAIN COULD ABOUT WHERE THE IN. IN THE FOR AND THE DETAIL IT HAS THE ABLE TO SHOW SOME. THIS CONCLUDES REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY HE PUT. OKAY THANK YOU- I A FEW QUESTIONS BUT I START WITH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE. THANK MISTER I I'VE GOT SAY THAT I I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT. IS LAST YEAR I ENTERED AB SIX. WITH THE OF. HAVING THIS TRANSFER AND- WE WERE PLEASED TO SEE THE GUY THROUGH THE BILL LANG- WAS ABLE TO DO THIS IT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE REASON. FOR THIS AND HAVE AND I IF I MAY RE JUST CENTER MISTER CHAIR HAVING ALL CHILD CARE PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED WITHIN ONE AGENCY IS INTENDED TO ALLOW FOR GREATER COLLABORATION INCLUDING IMPROVED ELIGIBILITY PROCESSES ACROSS THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND PROGRAMS IN SUPPORTING THE NEEDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. I THINK THIS YEAR I'VE INTRODUCED AB THREE NINETY THREE TO TWO ALSO HELP WITH THE SPECIFICS I'M SO GLAD TO SEE THE PLAN THAT HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER. I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS HOWEVER. AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVIDE THE TRAILER BILL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CO TRANSFERS. AND REGULATORY AUTHORITY NEEDED TO FOR THE TRANSITION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ESTATE IT'S ACTUALLY POSTED YESTERDAY SO ADD THAT TO THE BILL LANGUAGE JUST ABOUT LIFE IN ON THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES WEBSITE. WELL THAT'S A BIT ANSWER I COULD HAVE RECEIVED THANK YOU- THE ANOTHER QUESTION. WHY YOU CALIFORNIA'S PRESCHOOL REMAINING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR BIFURCATING. THESE TO EARLY EARNING AND CARE PROGRAMS A STATE PRESCHOOL AT CD AND CHILD CARE IT CDSS AND WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER TYPES OF BURDENS DOES THIS PLACE ON PROVIDERS. I'M GOING TO START THIS AND WITH DEFERRED OFF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO GET CAN JOHNSON DEPARTMENT SOCIAL. I WOULD SAY A PART OF THE- STATE PRESCHOOL REMAIN WITH THE PART YOU CASE IS. PARTIALLY SOURCE WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT AT ALL. MANY THE THINGS THAT YOU THIS HAS TALKING HERE TO SEE RELATED TO THE DIRECT CONNECTION I WOULD KINDERGARTEN INTO ADDITIONAL WORK THAT BEEN IT'S BEEN WAY I WOULD SAY THAT OUT YOU CAN DIM EITHER BUT CERTAIN REPORT OF THE SLASH YEAR AT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. SOCIAL SERVICES WORK TO IN MANY FORM WHETHER THEY WORK GROUPS FOR ON IMPROVEMENTS AS AT CAL WORKS CHILD CARE STAY MASTER PLAN EARLY CHILDHOOD POLICY COUNCIL ARE ALSO. AND PLACES WHERE THESE HAVE I'VE BEEN IN. IN ON BASIS FROM YEARS AND WE HAVE TO COMMIT SECOND THAT- AS I IN IN THE OPENING REMARK OF ALL MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE THINKING VERY. ABOUT THE CONNECTION OF BEACH CARE ABOUT THE PROGRAM THAT THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL WILL BE. AND THEIR CONNECTION I ONLY TO PRE K. C. K. BUT ALSO THE LARGE CAKES PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. A PROGRAM IN THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM. AND THEN IT TO KINDERGARTEN FIRST SECOND AND THIRD GRADE. THAT HE GETS REALIGNMENT IS ACTUALLY EVAN AND SPACE STRATEGY TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE THE ACT EARLY INTERVENTION AND SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. AND THAT THEY CONTINUE ON WITH THOSE. WE ALSO HAVE THE- SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS SO AS YOU LOOK AT WHERE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD AND FIVE YEAR OLDS ARE HAVE DISABILITIES. THEY'RE ALSO IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND WE THINK THAT CONTINUING WITH THE S. P. P. ALLOWS FOR THOSE INCLUSIVE PROGRAMS BE EXPANDED SO THAT MORE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES CAN BE IN AN INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOL SETTING. WITH THEIR PEERS. THANK YOU I AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I HAVE REALLY APPRECIATED THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO DEPARTMENTS. IN TRYING TO MAKE THIS AS SMOOTH A TRANSITION AS IT POSSIBLY CAN. ALWAYS KEEPING OUR- WHAT WAS IT THE LITTLEST OF LEARNERS IN MIND AS WE GO THROUGH THIS. I APPRECIATE ALSO THAT TO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WITH SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON'S BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT INCLUDED MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE- IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT THE THAT THE WORK THAT WAS DONE. ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY STAKEHOLDERS IS WHAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED. AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT ALL THE MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. BECAUSE IN THE END AND THAT'S WHO WE NEED TO INCLUDE IN ALL OF THIS. R. ANOTHER QUESTION. ACCORDING TO SOME STAKEHOLDERS THE CHILD CARE CONTRACTING PROCESS BEGINS IN MARCH. WHERE ARE THE DEPARTMENTS IN A TRANSFERRING THIS RESPONSIBILITY. TO BOTH MY COLLEAGUE AT THE DEPARTMENT'S VISION AND ALSO OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WE CHATTED PROVIDE SPECIFICS. THIS IS THEIR NUMBER MARKING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THEN WE HAVE TO START THIS PROCESS EASIER ACTUALLY AS WE LOOK AT OUR CONTRACT AND GETTING THEM OUT TO THE FIELD AND BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND OUR TEAM HAS BEEN UPDATING ALL OF THIS CONTRACT THAT THEY WILL GO OUT THAT REFLECT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES INSTEAD OF EACH OTHER CD WILL BE THE ONE THAT SENDS THEM OUT. AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING ACROSS OUR TO DEPARTMENTS ALONG WITH THEIR LEGAL TO OFFICE AS- YOU UPDATE A FACE SHEET THAT WILL GO OUT AS ART OF THAT. SO THAT WHOLE PROCESS IS BEING UPDATED SOMEONE TO REFLECT THE TRANSITION BUT SHOULD BE FOLLOWING THE SAME TIME LINE ITEM IT. FOLLOWS EVERY YEAR. THANK YOU MY PHONE COURSE- MISTER CHAIR. BUT GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC FOR ALL STATE AGENCIES BUT HERE MOST PARTICULARLY FOR THE PARTNER SOCIAL SERVICES. IS THERE A NEEDED TO EXTEND THE TIME LINE FOR THE FULL TRANSITION OF CHILD CARE PROGRAMS TO DSS. PRECHECK THE QUEST SENATE APPRECIATE THE HEAVY LIFT TO GET ACROSS ACROSS ALL ENTITIES WE DO IT- IN SERVICE TO WHAT WE SIGNED UP FOR SO I GET NOW AS AS I MENTIONED WE'RE ON TRACK FOR THE TRANSITION THEY HAD THE TWO COMPONENTS THAT I MENTIONED RELATED TO RECORDING- IN SOME FINANCIAL CLOSE OUT THOSE ARE THE DATA SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THOSE DETAILS AND AGAIN THAT. THAT THAT CONVERSATION CONTINUING WE'RE GETTING THE INPUT RIGHT NOW TO THE DRAFT TRANSITION PLAN THAT WE'VE OUTLINED I WE ARE ON TRACK FOR THE JULY ONE TRANSITION. WONDERFUL IS THAT THAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE QUICK ANSWERS THE ANSWER IS NO WE DON'T NEED MORE TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HARD WORK IT MEANS A LOT TO OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES AND- YEAH THIS WAS A HOT ISSUE- LAST YEAR. LAST YEAR TWO YEARS AGO I SAW A BLUR- YEAH AND- I WASN'T IN SUPPORT OF IT AS A HIGH PRIORITY. OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND I KNOW IT'S KIND OF I FEEL BAD AFTER IT'S KIND OF A TURF THING I SEE SOCIAL SERVICE AND SENIOR ALL GREAT PEOPLE FOCUSING ON OUR FAMILIES AND OUR KIDS. AND IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT THE TURF OF WHO OVER OVERSEAS IT BUT WHAT'S BEST FOR. THE FAMILIES AND HOW'S THAT ALIGN WITH PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK. THE DSS SHIFT ESPECIALLY WITH THE WITH WITH CHILD CARE FOCUSED ON MORE COORDINATION WITH ALL SORTS OF ASPECTS OF THE WHOLE FAMILY AND NO THAT'S BEEN A BIG PIECE. OF THE GOVERNOR'S MANTRA I WILL NOTE THAT THIS STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. I THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT CERTAIN OF ON WORKING MADE HIS IS THE ONE THAT'S SO COMPELLING ONE IT'S FUNDED UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT IT'S REALLY A SCHOOL BASED ONE. SO KEEPING IT UNDER THE SCHOOL UMBRELLA I THINK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE- A LOT OF PROGRAMS ARE AT ELLIE'S ANYWAY ARE AT SCHOOLS- NEW RESEARCH SHOWS HAVING ALIGNMENT WITH. THE P. THREE THREE IS THE WAY TO GO TO HAVE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION HAVE THOSE YOUNGEST LEARNERS- STEP UP AND GET RID OF THAT OUT AT THE OPPORTUNITY GAP OPPORTUNITY GAP. AND SO HAVING. US FURTHER COORDINATE BETWEEN- STATE PRESCHOOL AND T. K. N. FIRST SECOND AND THIRD GRADE- PROBABLY MAKES THE MOST SENSE WITH WITH WITH CD- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE WHAT L. A. L. HE IS- IS RECOMMENDING- I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE GOING TO. RE LITIGATE THAT WE HAVE. OTHER ISSUES AND I KNOW THIS IS A PRIORITY TO OF ADMINISTRATION AND- WE STARTED THROUGH THE EFFORTS I'M I JUST WANT TO MAYBE ADDRESS SOME OF THE- TO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES. I'M WE HAVE INCREASED- AND A CD IS DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS TRANSITION AND I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE- YOU KNOW DOING OTHER WORK AND THEN GIVING IT OVER TO SEE EASE- MESSER DSS SO. ARE WE PROPERLY- KALRA PAYING FOR INCOME. STILL THE- FOR. TO DO- OF THEIR WORK NEEDED THAT'S THAT'S QUESTION NUMBER. ONE EFFORT IN MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RELATED TO ANYTHING THAT RELATES TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S BUDGET. HI THIS IS SERRA BURNER ON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I APOLOGIZE CAN YOU REPEAT YOUR QUESTION. YES I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. THEY WERE TAKING CARE OF THIS CD E. NEEDS AS FAR AS THIS TRANSITION. HERE AS FAR AS MAKING SURE EVER ADDRESSING THEIR OVERTIME I KNOW PEOPLE ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO WORK ON THIS AND TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE. ADEQUATE STAFFING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS. YES SO OF PART OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF- RECOGNIZING THAT CD IS DOING SUCH A TREMENDOUS JOB- ON THIS TRANSITION- ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAMS GETTING OUT THESE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR UNCLE THE NINETEEN RESPONSE DOES INCLUDE SOME STATE ADMINISTRATION DOLLARS. ON TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THEIR NEEDS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR- AND WHAT THEY WILL BE NEEDING IN TERMS OF STOPPING- TO SHORE UP SOME OF THEIR PRESCHOOL NEEDS- THAT WILL BE REMAINING WE ARE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM- AND REFINING SOME OF OUR ESTIMATES- IN. ALIGNMENT WITH. THEIR STAFF TO SELL. ON THERE THERE'S MORE TO COME ON THAT BUT WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM TO ADDRESS THEIR VARIOUS NEEDS. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN AS FAR AS- THE NEW THEN THE LAST QUESTION IN THE BILL ON PAGE. EIGHT THAT THE POSITIONS THAT WENT TO CD FOR THE FOR THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS EVERTEC BUDGET TWO YEARS AGO. OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SAID DISARM STAY WITH. SEEDEATER A ARMOR BONTA DSS. YES SO THERE'S A FEW POSITIONS THAT- ARE MOVING OVER ON AND THEIR SON THAT CITY HAS IDENTIFIED NOW WILL BE SAYING AND THEN THERE'S EVEN MORE THAT CITY HAS IDENTIFIED ON THAT THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON STATE PRESCHOOL- SO A LOT OF THAT IS OUTLINED IN. THE ECP THAT'S BECAUSE OUR WEBSITE- AND AGAIN WHERE WE'RE CONTINUING TO REFINE SOME OF THE SYSTEMS YEAH AND LASTLY YOU KNOW THIS SEEMS LIKE A GROWN UP PROBLEMS IT'S A SACRAMENTO PROBLEM WHICH BUREAUCRAT IS GOING TO YOU KNOW FOCUS ON PAPERWORK AND CONTRACTS AND SO FORTH IN THE BIG PICTURE IS A TRY TO MAKE OUR PROGRAMS BETTER. TO CUT RED TAPE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PROVIDERS AND FOR FAMILIES SO HOW WE'RE DOING ON THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS. THAT THIS ACHIEVES THE GOALS THAT WE- SO- WE STARTED THIS A YEAR AGO. THAT CAN CAN JOHNSON OUR MISSILE SERVICES JUST A NUMBER OF PLACES HERE ID SAY THAT WORD AGAIN FOCUSED ON THAT- YOU KNOW WE ARE CERTAINLY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT HAVE HAVE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF- FREQUENTLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT IN THE IN THE INDIVIDUAL. ESPECIALLY INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS AND FAMILIES EXPERIENCING POVERTY CAN GET CONNECTED TO THE ROBUST ARRAY THAT WE HAVE BUILT IT'S PARTICULARLY CRITICAL FOR US TO DO THAT IN TIMES LIKE THAT SO AT THE MOST AS SPECIFIC EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE AT THAT AT THIS- EFFORT WOULD BE THE WORK WE'VE DONE ON THAT WHAT'S CALLED THE VERIFICATION HAVE WHICH IS. ESSENTIALLY SUPPORTING THE CONCEPT THAT BOTH IN TERMS OF ENROLLING INTO PROGRAMS WHETHER IT'S ACCESS TO WORK HOW WORKS PROGRAM OUR CALFRESH PROGRAMMER COULD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR ITS US A TRUCKER SUBSIDY THAT'S HAPPENING AT ONE TIME IN ONE PLACE AND ALSO IN TERMS OF MAINTAINING THAT SERVICE AT THE BACKEND ESSENTIALLY IS DOING THE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INCOMING INFORMATION IS UPDATED ACROSS ALL SYSTEMS THAT. AT ANY OTHER CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES ARE COMMUNICATED AND THE BURDEN IS NOT ON BOTH THE FAMILY TO DO THAT- BUT ALSO NOT ON THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR SO AT BATS AT EXAMPLE WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO STREAMLINED PROCESS SEES I HAD TO MAKE THIS- EASIER HAVE PROCESS FOR THE FAMILY BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO ARE ADMINISTERING. THESE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTION OF MY FINAL. AB FOR THE- NOW.
