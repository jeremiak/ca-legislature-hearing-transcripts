00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:42.959
BROADER QUESTION THAT GOES

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:44.794
BEYOND THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:46.763
BILL- OF PERHAPS A

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.865
PHILOSOPHICAL ONE IT MAY BE A

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:51.635
VERY PRACTICAL AND ONE THAT WE

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:55.539

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:56.940
PARTICULAR- WITH OUR TRAILER

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.909
BILL PROCESS I THINK WE ARE ALL

00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:01.811
POLICING FOR THAT REAR. WE ARE

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:04.114
ACTIVELY CONTEMPLATING A

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.516
RESILIENCY- PACKAGE THE

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.552
RESILIENCY BOND. THAT WOULD BE

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.153
A JOB CREATING ONE THAT'S THE

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.087

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:12.689
CONVERSATION BEFORE THIS

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:14.357
COMMITTEE TODAY. I THINK WE

00:53:14.424 --> 00:53:17.427
NEED TO- DEAL WITH THE FACT

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:18.695
THAT WHETHER IT'S- THIS CYCLE

00:53:18.762 --> 00:53:20.630
OR A FUTURE CYCLE THERE WILL BE

00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:23.133
FUNDING STREAMS FOR. OF THE

00:53:23.199 --> 00:53:24.634
GENERATIONAL CHALLENGE OF OUR

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:27.270
TIME IN CLIMATE. THAT WE NEED

00:53:27.337 --> 00:53:29.272
TO HAVE A PROCESSES IN PLACE.

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:30.607
SO WHEN THOSE FUNDS BECOME

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:33.310
AVAILABLE- WE HAVE A MECHANISM

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:35.145
IN PLACE TO PRIORITIZE A

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:37.347
REGIONAL PLANNING TO PRIORITIZE

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:40.216

FOR THE TAXPAYER BUCK- IN TERMS

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:44.554
OF ANY KIND OF FUTURE BOND

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:45.622
FINANCING OR OTHER FUNDING

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:46.990
MECHANISM SO REALLY THIS IS

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.825
ABOUT. INCENTIVIZING THE RIGHT

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:51.728

GOAL FOR CALIFORNIA NATURAL

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:50.966
LOOKING LANDS. WHY IS THIS BILL

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:54.470
IMPORTANT. AS A STATE WE MUST

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:55.838

REDUCE EMISSIONS OF CARBON. BUT

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:02.377
WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:04.413
DEVELOP PATHWAYS TO REMOVE

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.081
CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE

THE WORLD AGREE. IF WE'RE GOING

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.426
TO FEND OFF THE WORST IMPACTS

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:19.661
OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE MUST

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.463
MAXIMIZE METHODS TO SEQUESTER

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:24.233
OR CAPTURE CARD. CLEARLY

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:25.734
THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET WHEN

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.102
IT COMES TO REMOVING CO TWO

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:28.837
FROM THE ATMOSPHERE THERE'S NO

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.472
SINGLE TECHNOLOGY OR METHOD. TO

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.407

REMOVE ALL THAT IS REQUIRED.

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.445
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS ONE.

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.046
THERE ARE NATURAL WAYS TO

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.047
CAPTURE AND SUPPRESSED A

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:41.617
CARBON. AND TWO THERE ARE WAYS

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:43.318
TO CAPTURE CARD INVOLVE COMPLEX

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.120
ENGINEERING. AND QUITE

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:46.722
HONESTLY. REQUIRE A

GONNA TAKE TIME IT'S GONNA TAKE

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:01.870
MONEY. AND THE SECOND POINT

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:03.739

TERM PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE ARE

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.440
THE SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:46.841
AND WE WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:48.343
THAT DISCUSSION BUT WE ALSO

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:49.310
KNOW THAT IF WE'RE GONNA

01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:51.012
CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.447
NEED TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE.

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:54.215
OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE BILL

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:56.017
DEVELOP THE PATHWAY OF CREATING

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:57.485
A GOAL AND MEASURING PROGRESS

01:25:57.552 --> 01:25:59.587
TOWARDS THAT GOAL- WITH ITEMS

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:00.955
LEFT OUT I'LL GIVE YOU ONE

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:03.057
EXAMPLE IN THE LATEST DRAFT OF

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:03.925
THE NATURAL MARKING LANDS A

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.927
COMMENDATION PLAN WHICHWILL

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:07.195
LIKELY BE THE BASIS FOR

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:09.397
DEVELOPING SEQUESTRATION GOAL

01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:11.699
IT ONLY PROPOSES TO ACCOUNT FOR

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:12.333
STATE FUNDED THE- PROJECT WELL

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:15.136
THE IS A- INVESTMENT. THAT

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:16.604
LEAVES OUT OF THE PROJECT ARE

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:19.407
BEING DONE WITH FEDERAL.

01:26:19.474 --> 01:26:21.609
INCLUDING MILLION. ANY REDUCE

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:24.045
THE A AND R. AN ANY VOLUNTARY

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.413
PER WORK BE YOU CAN SO WE DON'T

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.181
THAT SETTING AN IMPORTANT GOAL

01:26:27.248 --> 01:26:28.683
AT THIS AND TRACKING WITH

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.618
MISSING DATA IS APPROPRIATE I

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:31.853
WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR FARMERS

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.621
AND RANCHERS BY NATURE ARE COST

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:36.491
CONSCIENCE AND LIKE ANY-BUSINESS OWNER THERE IF THEY'RE

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:38.059
GOING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IF

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:39.427
THEY CAN GET A RETURN ON THAT

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.462
INVESTMENT FROM A CORPORATE

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:42.697
PERSPECTIVE IF THE PRACTICE OF

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:44.899
A FARMER RANCHER TO EIGHT. YEAR

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.200
OLD OR IMPROVE THE LEAVE THEIR

01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:47.669
PRODUCT- IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:48.736
THAT OUR MEMBERS WOULD HAVE

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:49.771
DONE THAT ARE READY AND MAKE

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:51.906
THAT INVESTMENT THIS MEANS SPUR

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:53.374
LAND STEWARDS TO DO EVEN MORE

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:54.742
THAN THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THEY

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:55.543
NEED THEY NEED FINANCIAL

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:57.845
INCENTIVES AND WHILE THE STATE

01:26:57.912 --> 01:26:59.047
HAS PROVIDED FUNDS THEY'VE DONE

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:01.182
SO INCONSISTENTLY AND LOOKING

01:27:01.249 --> 01:27:02.984
AT THAT POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.153
BUDGET DEFICIT WITH TWO YEAR

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:07.055
AND THREE YEAR PROJECTED IMPACT

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:08.756
CONSISTENT AND ADEQUATE FUNDING

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:10.858
WILL LIKELY BE NOTHING IN SHORT

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:12.660
WE ARE CONCERNED THE STATE'S

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:17.131
BUDGET. WON'T MATCH. TEN FOR

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:18.099
WORK OR NOT. TOWARD THE

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.100
WELLINGTON. WILL CREATE WONDERS

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:21.169
AND LOSERS. SOME COMMODITIES OR

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.837
TYPE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:24.205
NATURALLY HAVE A GREATER

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:25.773
CAPACITY TO SUPPORT YOUR CARBON

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.343
THAN OTHERS- AN ORCHARD CROP

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:30.244
WITH DEEPER ROOT OVER IT I TEND

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:31.813
MAY DRAW DOWN MORE CARBON THAN

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.982
AN ANNUAL CROP. SO GIVEN THAT

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:35.783
SOME FARMS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:37.452
INCENTIVE TO WHERE THE OTHERS

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:39.253
ARE NOT. AND MORE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.822
SHOULD A FARMER MAKE A DECISION

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:42.557
ON WHAT TO PLANT BASED ON WHAT

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.058
DROPPED ON THE MOST CARBON.

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.059
RATHER THAN WHAT'S BEST FOR

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:46.427
THEIR LAND OR WHAT THE MARKET

01:27:46.494 --> 01:27:48.363
DICTATES. WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.131
CONSOLIDATION OF FARMS WE'RE

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:51.165
GOING TO SEE MORE PRESSURE ON

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:52.500
THE SMALL FARMS THAT ARE MAKING

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:54.569
A SPECIALTY ITEMS. AND

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:55.203
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE WE'RE GOING

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:56.604

AGRICULTURE. NOBLE AND ADAPTIVE

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:01.476

MCCARTY ALTHOUGH I'M SURE YOU

01:58:01.274 --> 01:58:02.775
ARE VERY WELL VERSED BUT I JUST

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:05.645
WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT I

01:58:05.711 --> 01:58:06.245
WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS

01:58:06.312 --> 01:58:08.981
BILL TODAY THE ISSUE THAT

01:58:09.048 --> 01:58:10.783
CAUSES THE BIGGEST- HARPER AND

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:12.485
IS LIKE THE OTHER RETAIL FOOD

01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:13.719
ESTABLISHMENTS RIGHT SO THERE'S

01:58:13.786 --> 01:58:15.521
LIKE BROUGH POPS OUT WINERIES

01:58:15.588 --> 01:58:16.522
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT HAVE A

01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:18.224
LOT OF WASTED THAT GOES FOR

01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:20.159
FEED STOCK RIGHT NOW. SO WHY

01:58:20.226 --> 01:58:22.562
NOT MAKE THAT EXPLICIT IN HERE

01:58:22.628 --> 01:58:25.431
SO THERE'S I THINK THERE'S ROOM

01:58:25.498 --> 01:58:26.499
TO WORK IN A LOOK FORTY MAYBE

01:58:26.566 --> 01:58:27.667
SUPPORTING THIS LATER BUT

01:58:27.733 --> 01:58:29.735
INTELLIGENCE TIGHTENED UP SO

01:58:29.802 --> 01:58:31.771
THIS MISTER AT MATHIS POINTED

01:58:31.838 --> 01:58:33.372
OUT IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE

01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:36.309
FEEDSTOCK WITH I MEAN. EVEN IF

01:58:36.375 --> 01:58:37.009
IT'S COMPOST. THIS IS LAND

01:58:37.076 --> 01:58:39.979
FILL. GOING TO FEED- STOCK

01:58:40.046 --> 01:58:41.214
RIGHT NOW THAT IS CURRENTLY IN

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.348
EXISTENCE SHOULD BE THE

01:58:42.415 --> 01:58:44.083
PRIORITY PEOPLE ANIMALS

01:58:44.150 --> 01:58:47.086
COMPOST- SO INTO SOME OF THOSE

01:58:47.153 --> 01:58:47.920
THINGS I THINK ARE MORE CLEARLY

01:58:47.987 --> 01:58:49.689
DEFINED. I WILL BE ABLE SUPPORT

MAKE A COMMENT. SURE. WE ARE

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:05.438
LIVE IN AND- BECAUSE THAT THAT

01:59:05.505 --> 01:59:07.139
THE TIME SAID THAT DEALING WITH

01:59:07.206 --> 01:59:08.374
THE CALL OF IT IT STARTS FROM

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:10.543
LONG TERM REALITY IS SOMETHING

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:11.878
THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE BUT

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:12.879
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:59:12.945 --> 01:59:14.347
DON'T USE THAT AS AN EXCUSE NOT

01:59:14.413 --> 01:59:16.682
TO DO ANY OF OUR OTHER WORK-

01:59:16.749 --> 01:59:18.351
AND THAT WE WOULD FIND A WAY TO

01:59:18.417 --> 01:59:20.753
MULTI TASK- WERE WORTH UP

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:22.455
APPROPRIATE I WAS HERE WHEN WE

IN THE DEAL LESS THAN- I DO

01:59:30.863 --> 01:59:31.664
THINK THAT THERE'S SOME

01:59:31.731 --> 01:59:33.032
CLARIFICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:59:33.099 --> 01:59:35.368
DONE IN THIS BILL AND I DO

01:59:35.434 --> 01:59:35.968
THINK THAT THERE'S A SPACE FOR

01:59:36.035 --> 01:59:37.336
THE OPPOSITION AND THE OTHER TO

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:39.005
CONTINUE TO WORK ON WHAT THAT

01:59:39.071 --> 01:59:40.473
FACE MIGHT BE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:42.408
WE ARE HONORING A DEAL THAT WAS

01:59:42.475 --> 01:59:44.377

WITH ALL THAT WAY SUCH AS WITH

02:44:07.771 --> 02:44:09.673
AGRICULTURE BUT THINK ABOUT ALL

02:44:09.739 --> 02:44:11.274
THE BILLS WE VOTED ON HERE FOR

02:44:11.341 --> 02:44:14.010
FIRE MITIGATION- THE CAMPFIRE

02:44:14.077 --> 02:44:15.845
THE FIRE AND- THIS MODES

02:44:15.912 --> 02:44:16.980

JULIE ELEVEN AGAIN WITH THE BIO

02:45:17.841 --> 02:45:19.509
ENERGY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA

02:45:19.576 --> 02:45:20.744
SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

02:45:20.810 --> 02:45:22.445
MISUNDERSTANDING IN THE

02:45:22.512 --> 02:45:24.481
OPPOSITION ARGUMENTS ARE WHEN

02:45:24.547 --> 02:45:25.448
IT COMES TO FOREST OR

02:45:25.515 --> 02:45:27.584
AGRICULTURAL WASTE A LOT OF

02:45:27.651 --> 02:45:28.752
THAT WASTE IS BEING

02:45:28.818 --> 02:45:30.287
MECHANICALLY SENT PURSUANT TO

02:45:30.353 --> 02:45:31.955
STATE LAW SB NINE A ONE WHICH

02:45:32.022 --> 02:45:33.857
REQUIRES A DOUBLING OF FORCE

02:45:33.923 --> 02:45:35.492
YOU'LL REMOVE ALL. THE REALLY

02:45:35.558 --> 02:45:36.793
ONLY A FEW OPTIONS WITH IT CAN

02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:38.194
BE PILED AND LEFT TO ROT IN

02:45:38.261 --> 02:45:39.529
WHICH CASE IT IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:45:39.596 --> 02:45:41.364
SOURCE OF METHANE. BUT ACTUALLY

02:45:41.431 --> 02:45:42.932
THE FAR MORE DAMAGING

02:45:42.999 --> 02:45:45.035
ALTERNATIVE USE IS TO PILOT UP

02:45:45.101 --> 02:45:46.436
AND BURN IT OR TO DO PRESCRIBE

02:45:46.503 --> 02:45:48.171
FIRE IN THE FOREST BOTH OF

02:45:48.238 --> 02:45:49.673
WHICH ARE MAJOR SOURCES OF

02:45:49.739 --> 02:45:51.675
BLACK CARBON EMISSIONS. BLACK

02:45:51.741 --> 02:45:53.243
CARBON IS FORTY THREE TOP IS

02:45:53.310 --> 02:45:54.711
MORE DAMAGING TO THE CLIMATE

02:45:54.778 --> 02:45:57.213
EVEN THE NOTHING WHICH IS

02:45:57.280 --> 02:45:57.714
SEVENTY FOUR TIMES WERE

02:45:57.781 --> 02:45:59.883
DAMAGING CARBON DIOXIDE. SO THE

02:45:59.949 --> 02:46:01.951
OPPONENTS ARE IGNORING THE VERY

02:46:02.018 --> 02:46:02.986
SIGNIFICANT BLACK CARBON

02:46:03.053 --> 02:46:04.421
EMISSIONS FROM BURNING A FORCE

02:46:04.487 --> 02:46:06.189
WASTE OR WILD FIRES WERE

02:46:06.256 --> 02:46:08.224
BURNING OF AGRICULTURAL WASTE.

02:46:08.291 --> 02:46:10.226
THEIR FIRE WEATHER CONTROL OVER

02:46:10.293 --> 02:46:12.395
OF OURS DO ALL THESE NOTHING

02:46:12.462 --> 02:46:13.530
AND SO IS THIS PURPOSE

02:46:13.596 --> 02:46:18.635
MATERIALIZE LEFT FILE STRIP.

02:46:18.702 --> 02:46:19.336
THE OPPONENTS ARE ALSO. URBAN

02:46:19.402 --> 02:46:20.170
WOULD. THE MAJORITY OF THE

02:46:20.236 --> 02:46:21.438
ORGANIC. ORGANIC WASTE IS

02:46:21.504 --> 02:46:22.839
CURRENTLY TO LANDFILLS WHICH

02:46:22.906 --> 02:46:25.175
HAS TO BE DIVERTED BY TWENTY

02:46:25.241 --> 02:46:26.209
TWENTY FIVE THE VAST MAJORITY

02:46:26.276 --> 02:46:28.044
IS CELLULOSIC WASTE. WHEN IT

02:46:28.111 --> 02:46:29.045
GOES TO A LANDFILL WHETHER

02:46:29.112 --> 02:46:30.213
THAT'S URBAN WOULD WASTE OUR

02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:31.514
YARD TRêN MEANS OR

02:46:31.581 --> 02:46:33.350
CONSTRUCTION DEBRIS. IN A

02:46:33.416 --> 02:46:34.617
LANDFILL IT ALSO RELEASES

02:46:34.684 --> 02:46:36.519
METHANE LEAKAGE THE CALIFORNIA

02:46:36.586 --> 02:46:37.721
RESOURCES WERE LEAKAGE FROM

02:46:37.787 --> 02:46:39.556
LANDFILLS IS MUCH HIGHER. THAN

02:46:39.622 --> 02:46:43.259
LEAKAGE FROM PIPELINES. SO IF

02:46:43.326 --> 02:46:44.461
YOU RELY ON THE CALIFORNIA AIR

02:46:44.527 --> 02:46:46.062
RESOURCES BOARD OR THE ENTIRE

02:46:46.129 --> 02:46:47.897
STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL

02:46:47.964 --> 02:46:49.332
AIR DISTRICTS. THEIR ASSESSMENT

02:46:49.399 --> 02:46:52.369
IS THAT THE NET REDUCTION IS

02:46:52.435 --> 02:46:54.070
98299% AND NOTHING AND BLACK

02:46:54.137 --> 02:46:56.306
CARBON EMISSIONS. FROM BIOMASS

02:46:56.373 --> 02:47:01.378
CONVERSION. THANK YOU I UP IF I

02:47:01.444 --> 02:47:05.115
MAY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO. COM

02:47:05.181 --> 02:47:07.083
AND I AND I WANT TO GET INTO A

02:47:07.150 --> 02:47:09.619
BACK AND FORTH BUT- THE LETTER

02:47:09.686 --> 02:47:12.055
OF OPPOSITION DOES DISTINGUISH

02:47:12.122 --> 02:47:14.691
BETWEEN THE BY A METHANE DERIVE

02:47:14.758 --> 02:47:16.593
FROM. THE ANAEROBIC

02:47:16.659 --> 02:47:18.561
DECOMPOSITION- IN FROM

02:47:18.628 --> 02:47:21.231
LANDFILLS AND WASTEWATER

02:47:21.297 --> 02:47:23.433
TREATMENT PLANTS. YOU KNOW I

02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:26.336
I'VE BEEN ON SEVERAL TOWARDS

02:47:26.403 --> 02:47:27.437
SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA

02:47:27.504 --> 02:47:29.472
FORESTRY FOUNDATION I KNOW THAT

02:47:29.539 --> 02:47:31.040
THERE IS A REAL DILEMMA IN

02:47:31.107 --> 02:47:32.075
TERMS OF WHAT TO DO WITH. WITH

02:47:32.142 --> 02:47:36.446
THE WHAT PRODUCTS- THAT WET

02:47:36.513 --> 02:47:37.914
WEATHER FROM FOREST THINNING

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:41.751
OR- OR FOREST MANAGEMENT OF

02:47:41.818 --> 02:47:46.489
OVER OR OTHER SOURCES- BUT IT

02:47:46.556 --> 02:47:49.559
IT JUST. SEEMS CONTRADICTORY TO

02:47:49.626 --> 02:47:50.794
ME THAT THAT WE'RE SPENDING ALL

02:47:50.860 --> 02:47:53.263
THIS EFFORT AND MONEY TO TRY TO

02:47:53.329 --> 02:47:54.864
CUT DOWN ON GREENHOUSE GAS

02:47:54.931 --> 02:47:56.599
EMISSIONS AND ACCORDING TO THE

02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:58.001
AUTHORS OWN STATEMENT THAT.

02:47:58.067 --> 02:47:59.602
METHANE EMISSIONS IS ONE OF THE

02:47:59.669 --> 02:48:00.837
MOST DAMAGING SHORT LIVED

02:48:00.904 --> 02:48:03.139
CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND YOU KNOW

02:48:03.206 --> 02:48:04.307
AND SO I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE

02:48:04.374 --> 02:48:06.543
CREATING THIS- THIS PRESIDENT

02:48:06.609 --> 02:48:08.812
OF WITH THE POTENTIAL OF

02:48:08.878 --> 02:48:12.015
ACTUALLY INCREASING- METHANE

02:48:12.081 --> 02:48:13.049
PRODUCTION RATHER THAN

02:48:13.116 --> 02:48:15.618
DECREASING FOR THAT REASON I'LL

02:48:15.685 --> 02:48:16.953
BE OPPOSING THE BILL. THANK YOU.

PLACE WHERE WE HAVE ALL CLEAN

02:48:31.234 --> 02:48:32.802
ENERGY BUT THE FACT REMAINS WE

02:48:32.869 --> 02:48:34.170
CURRENTLY HAVE BY PRODUCTS FROM

02:48:34.237 --> 02:48:35.805
OUR ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN

02:48:35.872 --> 02:48:36.439
LESS WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TREES

THERE THAT FORGET THAT WERE ALL

02:49:52.815 --> 02:49:55.652
CARBON BASED LIFE FORMS- AND

02:49:55.718 --> 02:49:57.554
CARBON IS NOT GOING AWAY IN

02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:01.224
THIS IDEAL OF CARBON ZERO IS.

02:50:01.291 --> 02:50:03.860
TOBY IN FAIRY TALE IN THE BEST

02:50:03.927 --> 02:50:05.628
WE CAN SHOOT FOR IS A CARBON

02:50:05.695 --> 02:50:09.632
NEUTRAL- STANDARD AND WE HAVE

02:50:09.699 --> 02:50:12.235
TO DO SOMETHING WITH THESE

02:50:12.302 --> 02:50:13.570
PRODUCTS AND WITH THIS WASTE.

02:50:13.636 --> 02:50:15.838
THAT IS OTHERWISE GOING TO HARM

02:50:15.905 --> 02:50:20.543
US IN OTHER WAYS- IN AGAIN-

SEASON WE SEE THIS THROUGH ACT

02:50:26.849 --> 02:50:28.351
PRODUCT WASTE THROUGH OPEN BURN

02:50:28.418 --> 02:50:33.022
PITS- THERE'S DEFINITELY A WAY

02:50:33.089 --> 02:50:35.992
TO HARNESS THIS ENERGY THAT IS

02:50:36.059 --> 02:50:39.228
OTHERWISE BEING WASTED- THROUGH

02:50:39.295 --> 02:50:41.064
THE PROCESS AND TURN IT INTO

02:50:41.130 --> 02:50:43.399
SOMETHING THAT'S VALUABLE THAT

02:50:43.466 --> 02:50:47.236
HELPS GO TOWARDS- OUR GOALS OF

02:50:47.303 --> 02:50:49.005
RENEWABLE ENERGY AND I THINK

02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:51.407
THIS BILL DOES THAT. AND FOR

02:50:51.474 --> 02:50:53.376
THOSE REASONS I'D LIKE TO JUMP

02:50:53.443 --> 02:50:55.645
IS A JOINT AUTHORED WITH YOU AS

FIRST POINT THAT NOW IT'S NOT A

02:51:06.723 --> 02:51:08.891
MANDATE. AND SECONDLY I THINK

02:51:08.958 --> 02:51:11.060
THIS IS WHY- TO YOUR SECOND ONE

02:51:11.127 --> 02:51:11.861
I THINK THIS IS WHY YOU SEE

02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:14.430
EVERYBODY FROM THE CLEAN ENERGY

02:51:14.497 --> 02:51:17.400
GROUPS TO THE- AIR POLLUTION

02:51:17.467 --> 02:51:18.434
CONTROL DISTRICTS TO THE

02:51:18.501 --> 02:51:19.702
PREFERRED POLLUTION CONTROL

02:51:19.769 --> 02:51:21.471
OFFICERS WHO TESTIFIED. AND

ALSO THE WASTE MANAGEMENT

02:51:23.139 --> 02:51:24.307
GROUPS I THINK THEY ALL SEE

02:51:24.374 --> 02:51:27.176
THIS AS A WAY TO TACKLE- THIS

02:51:27.243 --> 02:51:28.544

INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE IT TO

02:51:29.912 --> 02:51:31.180
CLEAN ENERGY AND SO I THINK

02:51:31.247 --> 02:51:32.148
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE BROAD

02:51:32.215 --> 02:51:34.417

03:16:49.564 --> 03:16:50.532
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE GENERAL

03:16:50.598 --> 03:16:52.667
FUND IS GOING TO DO. WHAT THE

03:16:52.734 --> 03:16:53.768
STATE BUDGET IS GOING TO LOOK

03:16:53.835 --> 03:16:55.603
LIKE BUT I DO SEE THIS IS A

03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:58.273
VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:16:58.339 --> 03:17:01.376
CALIFORNIA TO LIE TO LEVERAGE.

03:17:01.442 --> 03:17:03.011
ITS GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS IN

03:17:03.077 --> 03:17:04.746
RESILIENCE AND TRADITION

03:17:04.812 --> 03:17:06.314
ORIGINALLY THIS IS START OFF

03:17:06.381 --> 03:17:08.349
WITH CLIMATE RESILIENCE BUT THE

03:17:08.416 --> 03:17:10.018
ECONOMIC RESILIENCE IS GOING TO

03:17:10.084 --> 03:17:11.719
BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF

03:17:11.786 --> 03:17:12.820
THIS AND I THINK WE CAN

03:17:12.887 --> 03:17:14.122
CERTAINLY DO BOTH. ONE OF THE

03:17:14.189 --> 03:17:16.224
THINGS I WILL JUST THAT I HAD

03:17:16.291 --> 03:17:18.126
BEEN TALKING AND TALKING AND

03:17:18.193 --> 03:17:19.227
TALKING ABOUT QUITE A BIT

03:17:19.294 --> 03:17:20.094
BEFORE WHEN WE'RE SOME OF THE

03:17:20.161 --> 03:17:22.497
CLIMATE RESILIENCE PART OF WHEN

03:17:22.564 --> 03:17:24.365
THIS WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON

03:17:24.432 --> 03:17:25.633
RESILIENCE OF THE CLIMATE. BUT

03:17:25.700 --> 03:17:27.101
I THINK IT'S ALSO TRUE FOR THE

03:17:27.168 --> 03:17:28.603
ECONOMIC RESILIENCE IS WE HAVE

03:17:28.670 --> 03:17:30.538
YET TO CREATE. REAL STANDARDS

03:17:30.605 --> 03:17:32.173
AROUND WHAT THAT RESILIENCE

03:17:32.240 --> 03:17:35.610
MEANS. AND MY FEAR FOR. JUST

03:17:35.677 --> 03:17:36.878
COMING UP WITH ANOTHER POT OF

03:17:36.945 --> 03:17:38.780
MONEY IS IT WILL GET SPENT ON

03:17:38.846 --> 03:17:39.814
THINGS THAT ARE JUST AND

03:17:39.881 --> 03:17:41.549
EVERYBODY'S Q. BECAUSE I THINK

03:17:41.616 --> 03:17:45.053
A LOT OF. THE SUPPORT THE

03:17:45.119 --> 03:17:46.888
SUPPORT AMEND IT IF AMENDED BY

03:17:46.955 --> 03:17:48.122
THE CONCERNS RAMPS ARE PHOTO.

03:17:48.189 --> 03:17:49.557
JUST LOOK FOR DOLLARS

03:17:49.624 --> 03:17:50.825
APPROPRIATELY TO CONTINUE THE

03:17:50.892 --> 03:17:52.860
PROJECTS THAT THEY HAVE HAD.

03:17:52.927 --> 03:17:54.429
BUT IF WE DON'T ESTABLISH

03:17:54.495 --> 03:17:55.930
APPROPRIATE STANDARDS FOR WHAT

03:17:55.997 --> 03:17:58.600
RESILIENCE MEANS HOW WE PLAN

03:17:58.666 --> 03:18:00.068
FOR THE APPROPRIATE PRODUCT

03:18:00.134 --> 03:18:02.704
PROJECTS. UP IN THE COMMUNITIES

03:18:02.770 --> 03:18:04.639
IN IT WITH THE AGENCIES THAT

03:18:04.706 --> 03:18:06.074
WILL BE. TAKING ON THIS MONEY

03:18:06.140 --> 03:18:08.142
THEN WE HAVE NO ASSURANCE THAT

03:18:08.209 --> 03:18:09.510
ANY OF THE MONEY IS GOING TO BE

03:18:09.577 --> 03:18:11.079
SPENT. FOR THE PURPOSES

03:18:11.145 --> 03:18:14.349
OUTLINED. IN THE IN THE BOX SO

03:18:14.415 --> 03:18:16.918
FOR GONNA SELL IT IS RESILIENCE

03:18:16.985 --> 03:18:18.219
WHETHER CLIMATE RESILIENCE. OR

03:18:18.286 --> 03:18:19.387
ECONOMIC RESILIENCE AND WHEN HE

03:18:19.454 --> 03:18:20.622
GETS ON THE BALLOT THAT'S

03:18:20.688 --> 03:18:21.389
PROBABLY HOW IT'S GOING TO GET

03:18:21.456 --> 03:18:23.258
SPENT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

03:18:23.324 --> 03:18:24.726
THAT WE HAVE MECHANISMS IN

03:18:24.792 --> 03:18:26.794
PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY

03:18:26.861 --> 03:18:29.364
GETS SPENT FOR THOSE PURPOSES.

03:18:29.430 --> 03:18:31.132
SO ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

03:18:31.199 --> 03:18:34.235
MONEY. BUT I AM ALSO HOPING

03:18:34.302 --> 03:18:36.104
THAT IN THE BOND FOR THROUGH

03:18:36.170 --> 03:18:38.439
OTHER MECHANISMS WE BUILD IN

03:18:38.506 --> 03:18:40.708
AND FUND AND HELP OUT. LOCAL

03:18:40.775 --> 03:18:43.811
JURISDICTIONS ESPECIALLY WHO

03:18:43.878 --> 03:18:45.179
ARE GOING TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF

03:18:45.246 --> 03:18:47.348
THE- INS AND RECOVERY OVER THE

03:18:47.415 --> 03:18:49.917
NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS. THAT

03:18:49.984 --> 03:18:52.020
THESE INVESTMENTS THAT ALSO

03:18:52.086 --> 03:18:53.788
COME WITH WAYS OF HELPING THOSE

03:18:53.855 --> 03:18:57.358
JURISDICTIONS. DO THE PLANNING.

03:18:57.425 --> 03:18:58.559
NECESSARY AND THAT WE STATE

03:18:58.626 --> 03:19:00.395
APPROPRIATE STANDARDS SO THAT

03:19:00.461 --> 03:19:02.096
WE HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST WHICH

03:19:02.163 --> 03:19:04.299
TO MEASURE THOSE PROJECTS AND

03:19:04.365 --> 03:19:05.967
THOSE INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S-

03:19:06.034 --> 03:19:08.469
PARTLY THIS BOND IT'S PARTLY

03:19:08.536 --> 03:19:11.306
OUTSIDE OF THIS BOND BECAUSE IT

03:19:11.372 --> 03:19:13.374
NEEDS TO BE. A CONVERSATION

03:19:13.441 --> 03:19:16.010
ABOUT HOW WE SEE THOSE. HELLO

03:19:16.077 --> 03:19:17.512
JURISDICTIONS DO PLANNING. THEY

03:19:17.578 --> 03:19:19.814
DIDN'T HAVE MY- IN THE OLD. TO

03:19:19.881 --> 03:19:20.815
DO THAT PLANNING THERE

03:19:20.882 --> 03:19:21.816
CERTAINLY COULD HAVE LESS OF

03:19:21.883 --> 03:19:25.019
THAT NOW SO WE NEED TO BE

03:19:25.086 --> 03:19:26.721
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE ADDRESS

03:19:26.788 --> 03:19:28.823
THOSE ISSUES. AND WE'RE GONNA

03:19:28.890 --> 03:19:30.124

TO SPACE WE WERE AT BEFORE I

03:25:07.361 --> 03:25:08.129

COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WERE

03:25:09.397 --> 03:25:11.832
ALWAYS THE- END OF THE LINE AND

03:25:11.899 --> 03:25:13.467
WE SEE LITTLE TO NOTHING FROM A

03:25:13.534 --> 03:25:15.569

AND SOME OF HEM BEEN IN A LOT

03:25:48.569 --> 03:25:50.571
OF THOSE METINGS- THAT THESE

03:25:50.638 --> 03:25:52.106
ARE ALL EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN

03:25:52.173 --> 03:25:53.774
BROUGHT UP IN THE TOPICS THAT

03:25:53.841 --> 03:25:54.909
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND WILL

03:25:54.975 --> 03:25:56.744
CONTINUE TO DISCUSS. I'D SAY

03:25:56.811 --> 03:25:58.279
ABOUT A MONTH AGO I WAS A

03:25:58.345 --> 03:26:00.815
LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE

03:26:00.881 --> 03:26:01.849
CHANCES FOR THIS FARM GOING

03:26:01.916 --> 03:26:03.617
FORWARD GIVEN THE IMPACT ON THE

03:26:03.684 --> 03:26:05.486
GENERAL FUND. BUT WE'VE BEEN

03:26:05.553 --> 03:26:07.988
HAVING ALL OF A LOT OF US KIND

03:26:08.055 --> 03:26:08.522
OF ON THE SIDE TALKS WITH

03:26:08.589 --> 03:26:12.093
ECONOMISTS AND- OTHERS WHO

03:26:12.159 --> 03:26:13.027
POINT OUT THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED.

03:26:13.094 --> 03:26:15.930
A CUSTOM. TO REALLY FOSTER

03:26:15.996 --> 03:26:18.265
FASTER RECOVERY I'M OUT OF THIS

03:26:18.332 --> 03:26:20.201
RECESSION THIS CODE AND BECAUSE

03:26:20.267 --> 03:26:22.770
RECESSION. AND RIGHT NOW.

03:26:22.837 --> 03:26:24.105
INTEREST RATES ARE AT HISTORIC

03:26:24.171 --> 03:26:26.907
LOWS. AND SO GIVEN THAT THERE

03:26:26.974 --> 03:26:27.942
ARE CO BENEFITS BESIDES

03:26:28.008 --> 03:26:29.443
STIMULUS FOR STIMULUS THE SAKE

03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:30.811
AND JOB CREATION FOR JOB

03:26:30.878 --> 03:26:31.712
CREATION SICK WHICH IS

03:26:31.779 --> 03:26:33.347
IMPORTANT. BUT IF WE CAN ALSO

03:26:33.414 --> 03:26:35.015
HAVE THE CO BENEFITS OF.

03:26:35.082 --> 03:26:36.517
INCREASING OUR WATER

03:26:36.584 --> 03:26:39.653
RESILIENCY. OF INCREASING OUR

03:26:39.720 --> 03:26:41.122
WORK ON WILD FIRE PREVENTION

03:26:41.188 --> 03:26:44.024
AND MITIGATION. ON INCREASING

03:26:44.091 --> 03:26:46.026
OF OUR RESILIENCY FROM THE

03:26:46.093 --> 03:26:48.262
EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING WHICH

03:26:48.329 --> 03:26:50.264
IS THE NEXT COMING CRISIS. THEN

03:26:50.331 --> 03:26:52.733
WE ALSO CAN MAKE FOR. A SAFER

03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:54.835
STATE WELL WE STIMULATE OUR

03:26:54.902 --> 03:26:57.338
ECONOMY- SO I DO THINK THAT

03:26:57.404 --> 03:26:59.440
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE

03:26:59.507 --> 03:27:01.442

03:27:01.509 --> 03:27:04.111
