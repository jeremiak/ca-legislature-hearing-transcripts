COMMITTEES PRESENTING BILLS ARE SITTING ON A OTHER COMMITTEES AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE MEASURE BEFORE TODAY AND IT'S A V.. SIX FORTY TWO BY SOME WOMAN WOMAN LEMOND SO IT YOU'RE READY -- YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR MEASURE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS UNDER EXISTING LAW THE DEFINITION OF BROKER IS VERY VAGUE AND CIRCULAR LEADING TO THE CONFUSION FROM LENDERS ABOUT WHICH ENTITIES. THEY CAN PARTNER WITH WHEN ARRANGING LOANS THE DEFINITION OF BROKER AN EXISTING LAW WAS FORMULATED LONG BEFORE THE RISE OF THE INTERNET AND THE EVOLUTION OF ONLINE LEAD GENERATION. SO OUR LAW NEEDS TO BE UPDATED WITH THIS ONLINE ACTIVITY IN MIND THIS BILL WILL ALLOW. ONLINE LENDERS TO GENERATE ONLINE LEAD GENERATORS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA SIMPLY THIS BILL REQUIRES THREE BASIC THINGS FROM THE COMPANY'S ONE GET A BUSINESS LICENSE FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENT AS CLOSURES TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THREE OBTAIN YOUR CUSTOMER'S CONSENT BEFORE SELLING AND TRANSMITTING THEIR CONFIDENTIAL DATA. I WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH LENDERS AND LEE GENERATORS OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSES THE CONSUMER PROTECTION CONCERNS AND OUR LENDING MARKETS WITHOUT PLACING. UNNECESSARY BURDENS ON THE BUSINESSES THAT WORK IN THIS AREA TO LAST YEAR'S PROCESS IT I WAS ABLE TO GET A LARGE NUMBER OF CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL LENDERS AND BROKERS COMFORTABLE WITH THIS APPROACH. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER PROVIDING HELP WITH AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPONENTS. IN YOUR FOLDERS YOU SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THE AUTHOR'S AMENDMENTS BASED ON THE SUGGESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THOSE AMENDMENTS RESPOND TO ALL OF THE CONCERNS LISTED IN THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE FINANCE ASSOCIATION LETTER IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING A NUMBER OF CONCERNS RAISED BY THE ONLINE LENDERS ALLIANCE. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW I HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT TO MAKESURE THAT THE PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL. CAN APPROPRIATELY IN FORCE BEING FORCED BY THE REGULATOR. BASED ON THAT ADVICE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE D. B. O. THERE ARE TWO PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT I COULD NOT ACCEPT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY UNDERMINE THE REGULAR THE REGULATORS ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW. OPPONENTS LIKELY WILL LIBRARY ON THOSE TWO POINTS IN THE HEARING TODAY I AM HAPPY TO RESPOND AND ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THOSE. BUT IN SUMMARY BOTH OF THOSE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD LIKELY PUT THIS BILL AND PRETTY IN THE EVENT THAT THIS BILL MAKES IT TO THE GOVERNOR. I HAVE HAD AN OPEN DELIVERED A PROCESS IN TRYING TO GET THIS BILL TO THE RIGHT PLACE AS SHOWN BY THE TENS -- THE TEN SETS OF AMENDMENTS THAT I HAVE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS VOICED BY THE INDUSTRY AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE STAFF. SINCE LAST YEAR. AS SHOWN IN THE HAND OUT IN. FRONT OF YOU WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO BE PASSED AROUND -- THERE WE HAVE A REMOVE SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION FROM THIS BILLING ADDRESS NUMEROUS CONCERN FROM THE INDUSTRY I WISH WE COULD HAVE FOUND A RESOLUTION TO EVERYONE'S CONCERNED BUT I FIND MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE POSITION OF OUR STATE REGULATOR IN THE POSITION OF THE TWO GROUPS.% IN OPPOSITION BASED ON MY CONVERSATIONS WITH DB O. CONSUMER GROUPS LENDERS AND BROKERS I KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL GO A LONG WAY IN CLARIFYING WHAT HAS BEEN A CONFUSING SECTION OF OUR STATE LENDING LAWS. I HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS EFFORT FORWARD AND NOT LET ARGUMENTS BY THE OPPONENT SINK THIS LONG EFFORT. ME TODAY I DO HAVE A SUPPORT. FOR THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL CANDLE KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION CLICK -- AS STATED BY THE UTHOR ONLINE LENDING IS THE FASTEST GROWING CHANNEL WHERE CONSUMERS FALL INTO HIGH COST LOANS WITH TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST RATES ONLINE LENDERS. ARE HEAVILY RELIANT ON THE GENERATORS TO GATHER CONSUMERS FINANCIAL INFORMATION. AND FUNNEL THAT DATA BACK TO LENDERS WHO BID AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL THE CONSUMER ALONE. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW IS UNCLEAR ON HOW THESE ONLINE LEAD GENERATORS ARE REGULATED. THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- AND IT MAKES CLEAR THAT THESE COMPANIES NEED TO LICENSE AN OVERSIGHT FROM OUR STATE'S FINANCIAL REGULATOR. WHILE WORKING WHILE OUR ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO FIGHT FOR STRONGER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS INCLUDING AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON THESE LANDS. THIS BILL WILL PUT A STOP TO THESE COMPANIES OPERATING IN THE SHADOWS AND FAILING TO TELL CONSUMERS HOW THEY ARE USING THEIR CONFIDENTIAL DATA. WE SUPPORT THIS REASONABLE APPROACH ME OR DRIVER THANK YOU THANK YOU THE QUICKNESS AND SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- CHRIS MORROW BEHALF OF ON DECK -- CAPITAL WHICH IS THE LARGEST ONLINE SMALL BUSINESS LENDING PLATFORM UNITED STATES AND USES TECHNOLOGY TO EXPAND ACCESS. TO CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ON DECK BELIEVES A SICK BABY SIX FORTY TWO WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CLARITY ON THE TREATMENT OF DIFFERENT WRITTEN REFERRAL RELATIONSHIPS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FINANCING LAW. WHICH HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY FOR COMMERCIAL LENDERS AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS REGARDING WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE PERMISSIBLE AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA. THE CFL IS FAILED TO KEEP PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN ONLINE MARKETING REFERRAL IN BROKERING ACTIVITIES EXISTING CERTAIN UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW TO APPLY THE CFL THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ACTIVITIES. HAS CREATED TRAPS FOR ON WHERE RECEIVE ALL LICENSEES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME AS MADE CFL LICENSURE LESS ATTRACTIVE FOR PROSPECTIVE LICENSEES. THE BILL WOULD CLARIFY THE EXISTING STATUTORY AND AMBIGUITY BY EXPRESSLY DEFINING. BROKERING ACTIVITY A BY SETTING CLEAR STANDARDS FOR MARKETING AND REFERRAL PROGRAMS THE BILL ALSO RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES AMONG CONVENTIONAL BROKERING ACTIVITIES WERE THE BROKER ACTIVELY MANAGES A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP. REFER OR ACTIVITIES WHERE THE BROKEN THE LENDER EXCHANGE CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER DATA AND PASS A PERIPHERAL ACTIVITIES WERE THE REFERRAL PARTNER SIMPLY PROVIDES MARKETING INFORMATION TO POTENTIAL BORROWERS. ALONG WITH A LINK TO THE LENDER'S WEBSITE THESE ACTIVITIES. AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT RISKS FOR SMALL BUSINESS BORROWERS AND ON THE LEVEL OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT SHOULD ALSO BE CALIBRATED. TO MASS THOSE RISKS ON DECK SUPPORTS THE TAILORED REGULATORY APPROACH TAKEN IN A B.. SIX FORTY TWO ACHIEVING THIS BALANCE IS COMPLICATED GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF REFERRAL MODELS THAT EXIST BUT THE BILL IS A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BY PROVIDING CLEAR DISTINCTIONS AMONG BROKERING A REFERRAL ACTIVITIES. AND ALLOWING CERTAIN FLEXIBILITY IN THE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS PERMITTED THERE UNDER THE BILL WILL PROVIDE GREATER LEGAL CERTAINTY CREATE A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR EXISTING CFL LICENSEES AND OPEN THE DOOR FOR MORE COMPANIES TO EXPLORE LICENSURE. UNDER THE CFL. FOR THOSE REASONS ON DECK SUPPORTS A B. SIX FORTY TWO APPRECIATION LEADERSHIP. OF A MISSILE MON IN THIS AREA AND RESPECTFULLY -- URGES IN MY BOAT. THANK YOU AND IT DOES SO WITH THIS IN SUPPORT EMILY PAPPAS ON BEHALF OF LENDING TREE WE SWITCH TO A SUPPORT POSITION WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR THE LAST. SEVERAL MONTHS AND GET INTO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN SUPPORT. FUTURE MEMBERS MIKE MONEGAN ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPPORT. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT SINGER NINE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE GAP TO PRINCIPAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HI BABY CANTON WITH THE ONLINE LENDERS ALLIANCE AND MORE IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO SAY BUT WE CONTINUE TO BE VERY STRONGLY OPPOSED -- WE JUST FIND THAT WE'RE HERE TWO YEARS LATER IN THE SAME POSITION THAT WE WERE -- LAST YEAR ARE I'M SORRY ONE YEAR LATER WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR WHEN THIS BILL AT THIRTY TWO OH SEVEN WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUES THAT WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT -- WE HAVE MET WITH THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF NUMEROUS TIMES WE'VE MET WITH DB O. NUMEROUS TIMES WHAT WE FIND -- INTERESTING IS THAT WE JUST HAD MEETINGS WITH THE VIDEO AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OVER THE PAST. TWO WEEKS AND THEY HAVE TOLD AS THEY DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL NOW FOR THERE IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE SAYING THAT THAT'S FINE BUT IN OUR MEETINGS WE HAVE ASKED WE HAVE REPEATEDLY ASKED TVO. WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL FOR YOU AND THEY HAVE REPEATEDLY TOLD US WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL? SO WE FEEL FRUSTRATED AT THAT THAT WE CAN'T GET AN ANSWER FROM D. B. O. WHEN WE ARE CONTINUALLY TOLD. LET US TO STOP SO COMMONPLACE. MANCHESTER PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR BRADFORD PRESENT. CHANG CHANG HERE COMING OUT OF DELHI. BROWSER. BROWSER HERE WEST SO. SO HERE POURTANT TINA. FOR THIS QUESTION I'M SORRY TO CONTINUE TO SMOKE YEAH WHEN WE ARE CONTINUALLY TOLD THAT OUR AMENDMENTS CANNOT BE ACCEPTED -- BECAUSE IF THE VIOS -- OBJECTIONS SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE B. O. THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY WEEK WE HAVE THE SAME TWO PRIMARY ISSUES WHICH ARE THE TIMING OF THE DISCLOSURES. AND WHO IS REQUIRED TO GIVE CONSENT WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED NUMEROUS ITERATIONS OF LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD GET THE AUTHOR TO WHERE SHE WANTS TO BE TO PROVIDE WITH ME IN A WHAT IS BEING PORTRAYED AS CONSUMER PROTECTION. BUT WILL ALSO COMPORT WITH THE BEHAVIOR OF THE CONSUMER ON THESE PLATFORMS -- THE LANGUAGE AS IT IS NOW IN THE BILL DOES NOT COMPORT WITH CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO CONSUMERS GOING TO OTHER SITES. SO -- UNTIL WE CAN HAVE THOSE TWO ISSUES TAKEN CARE OF WE WILL CONTINUE OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THE CHAIRMAN. AND SENATOR SO I I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION TO OPPOSE THIS BILL BUT THAT IS THE POSITION THAT WERE AND AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO HIDE IN THE SHADOWS. MY COMPANY WITH TWO COMPANIES ONE IS A LEAD GENERATOR PER SE AS THIS BILL DESCRIBES IT CALIFORNIA BASED. AND THE OTHER COMPANY HAS A CFL ON DETAIL LICENSE SO WE ARE OUT FRONT WE MEET WITH THE C. F. CFPB FTC. AND THE TV -- REGULARLY WE ARE NOT IN THE SHADOWS. WE HAVE BEEN PROMOTING THIS LEGISLATION AND THE CONCEPT OF THIS LEGISLATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE LAST YEAR'S A. B. THIRTY TWO OH SEVEN WE WERE OUT FRONT SAYING WE NEED SOME REGULATION BECAUSE THE BROKER DEFINITION IS MESSED UP. BUT THE THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACE IS LEAD JEN SOUNDS SIMPLE ON THE SURFACE IT'S A VERY COMPLEX VERY LAYERED. ACTIVITY. AND THE LEAD GENS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE CONCERNED ABOUT DEAL WITH. PRIMARILY SUBPRIME CONSUMERS. NOW HERE'S WHERE IS THE POSITION WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN PUT IN. THIS IS SUCH A COMPLICATED INDUSTRY THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REGULATE THE INDUSTRY AND PROTECT CONSUMERS IS STATE TO REGULATE THE LEAD AGGREGATORS. WHO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LANDERS? THERE'S NOT THAT MANY LEAD AGGREGATORS OUT THERE. WE HAVE STEPPED UP AND SAID GUESS WHAT WE CAN HELP WHY CAN'T YOU REGULATE THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PUBLISHERS ALL OVER THE WORLD. YOU CAN'T DO IT SO WE HAVE TAKEN A POSITION TO SAY GUESS WHAT USE US. USE US TO PROTECT CONSUMERS TO PROTECT THE GOOD SIDE OF THE INDUSTRY WE WILL TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY. AND WE'VE ACCEPTED A LOT OF THAT IN GENERATIONS OF THIS BILL BUT WE HAVE ALSO ASKED. THE AUTHOR OF MULTIPLE TIMES LET US WORK THE WAY WE NEED TO WORK WE CAN ACHIEVE THE THREE OBJECTIVES. THAT IS THE ONLY WOMAN LET ALONE STATED IN HER OPENING AND IN FACT ON JUNE ELEVENTH I SENT THE DB O. AND HER OFFICE A DESCRIPTION OF EACH OBJECTIVE THAT SHE LAID OUT. AND HOW WE CAN FULFILL THOSE OBJECTIVES WITH PROPER LANGUAGE NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM CONSUMER PROTECTION. JUST SAYING WE CAN MEET THESE OBJECTIVES THIS COMES DOWN TO A TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT MAKES OUR JOB IMPOSSIBLE AND WHEN OUR JOB IS IMPOSSIBLE IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOOD GUYS THAT ARE NOT HIDING IN THE SHADOWS. ARE GONNA BE FORCED OUT OF THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA OR WE'RE GOING TO BE AT SUCH A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE THAT WE CAN'T HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS AND THIS IS NOT ANECDOTAL. SO ON MARCH EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. A PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE THAT SAID SIX THE SCAMS THAT INVADE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER FOUR WAS ONLINE LENDING SCAMS. THERE ARE SOPHISTICATED TALENTED CRIMINAL ACTORS OUT THERE WHO DO CONSUMERS ALL THE TIME. IT HAPPENS NOW IF YOU TAKE A COMPANY LIKE MINE AND SAY. YOU CAN'T FUNCTION COMPETITIVELY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THEN WE ARE THAT WE ARE THE BEST AIR BAG OR THE SEAT BELT THE PROTECTION THE SHIELD FOR CONSUMERS. IF YOU TAKE US OUT OF THE EQUATION SO YOU CAN'T BE COMPETITIVE GUESS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BAD GUYS THEN HE DON'T CARE. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO REGISTER OR GET A LICENSE FROM THE T. V. -- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW THE RULES THEY DON'T FOLLOW THEM ALREADY. SOME MIGHT PLEAD FOR TWO YEARS HAS BEEN TO THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. PLEASE LET US FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT WE CAN DO BUSINESS THAT WE CAN PROTECT THE CONSUMERS JUST DON'T PUSH US OUT WITH THE LEGISLATION BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T. PROTECT ANYONE AND WE HAVE PROPOSED MULTIPLE WAYS OF DOING IT THEY DO NOT TAKE AWAY ANYTHING FROM WHAT. THE CHAIRWOMAN ONCE AND THOSE HAVE BEEN REJECTED OUTRIGHT MY JUNE ELEVENTH EMAIL EXPLAINING HOW WE MEET ALL THREE OF THOSE OBJECTIVES. NO REPLY FROM THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE NO REPLY FROM THE DEAL. WHAT DO WE DO WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION THIS DOESN'T? GET THERE UNFORTUNATELY SO WE ARE IN A POSITION TO TO HAVE TO OPPOSE IT THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MELANIE CUEVAS WITH CAN TANA WATSON HEARD MEN ON BEHALFOF THE TRIBE OF UPPER LAKE UNFORTUNATELY STILL IN OPPOSITION WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S REMOVAL OF THE ORIGINAL TRIBAL LANGUAGE WHICH WE FOUND TO BE -- I'M CLEAR AND VERY PROBLEMATIC WERE VERY DISHEARTENED TO SEE THAT SHE REJECTED THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS -- WHICH WE SUPPORTED ON ONE OF REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION. CLEAR FINDING WHICH ABOUT TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR BUSINESS FOR OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS AND FOR SURROUNDING COMMUNITY THANK YOU THE QUICKNESS. AS A MATTER NOT WHAT HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF TUNICA BLOCKS YOU TRIBE I'D LIKE TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH THAT THE SPEAKER HAD OF ME WE'RE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD COULD ANI REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THE QUICKNESS OUTSELLING REPRESENTING THE SMALL BUSINESS MINUS THE STATION JUST WANT TO THANK THE THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING ON THE FOUR ISSUES THAT WE RAISED IN OUR LETTER. MY CLIENT IS STILL REVIEWING THE LANGUAGE OF WE RECEIVED YESTERDAY AND JUST GOING THROUGH IT BUT JUST FROM OUR INITIAL REDUCING DAVE DRESS ALL THE CONCERNS THAT WOULD RAISE THE LETTER -- I CAN'T CHANGE OUR POSITION RIGHT NOW BUT TO PEERS THAT -- THAT IT DID THEY DID ADDRESS ALL OF THEM THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL BAUER ON BEHALF OF THE COMMERCIAL FINANCE COALITION -- WE TOO IN A SIMILAR POSITION TO ALEX'S. WERE REVIEWING THE THE AMENDMENTS -- WE BELIEVE THAT MORE CHANGES ARE IN ORDER AND IF THE BILL MOVES ALONG YOU KNOW WHEN. WE TALK TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT THEM -- BUT AT THIS TIME WE WE STILL ARE POST THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION SOON HEARING ON ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CENTER WORKS OF LITERATURE. ARE THERE MEET MEN SORT OF BEEN AGREED TO NO. THERE WERE THE BIG YOU REFERENCE AMENDMENTS AND THERE THE AUTHORS OF MOMENTS SENT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] WELL -- I SUPPORT THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND I ALSO AGREE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL EARLIER IN THE YEAR. AND THERE BEEN SOME -- CONCERNS RAISED -- ABOUT. I THINK THERE ARE ARGUMENTS THIS BILL CREATES. SOME CHALLENGES. TO FEDERAL SOVEREIGNTY LAWS AND THAT CONCERNS ME VERY MUCH THAT PART OF THE BILL IF I WOULD I WOULD JUST HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU TRY TO ADDRESS THAT. IN PARTICULAR THAT THIS MIGHT SET A BAD PRECEDENT TO KIND OF GET THE STATE INVOLVED IN SOVEREIGNTY ISSUES. WHICH IS NOT AN AREA I THINK WE SHOULD BE -- GOING INTO IF NOT -- SUPPORTING THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE -- THERE ARE ARE. TRIBES THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ELIMINATED. FROM -- FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH THROUGH. GENOCIDE AND AND AND IN THIS COUNTRY. AND I CAN'T THINK OF A OF A OF A PROTECTED GROUP IN OUR IN OUR COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN WRONG MORE THAN THE TRIBES. CURRENTLY THE HIGHEST HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES THE HIGHEST. POVERTY RATES IN THE COUNTRY AND IN OUR STATE. THE LOWEST COLLEGE ATTAINMENT RATES -- JUST A THE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGES OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY WITH AN A A DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP ARE IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION. AND THEY'RE STILL A LOT THAT WE NEED TO DO TO CORRECT CORRECT. THE WRONGS OF HISTORY AND THAT CONSUMERS TURNS ME ON THIS BILL -- ALL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WORK TO RESOLVE. THAT IN PARTICULAR AND AND THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO WORK IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU AND I WILL SAY THAT THE SO THE LANGUAGE THAT IS IN THE CURRENT BILL -- THAT'S THE LANGUAGE THAT WE RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE LAST YEAR AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS IT D. E. AMEND THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THAT PROPOSED TO JUST DELETE IT ALL TOGETHER. ON WHAT WE'VE ADVISED THE TRIBES IS IF THEY WANT LANGUAGE IN THERE TO COME TO AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON WHAT THAT LANGUAGE WOULD BE AND WE ONCE THERE IS AGREEMENT WE WOULD GLADLY PUT IT IN THERE. IN THE MEANTIME THE AMENDMENTS -- IN FRONT OF YOU DO DELETE IT COMPLETELY. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CENTER COPY OUR FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS THAT THE IT IT'S DELETED BECAUSE THAT'S A LANGUAGE THEY OBJECTED. TO RIGHT OKAY. AND WE WE WILL PUT. WHATEVER LANGUAGE THEY AGREE UPON WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SO THE LANGUAGE WAS GIVEN TO US DIRECTLY FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE LAST YEAR I THINK WHAT WAS MENTION IS THE CONFUSION OFF WITH THE D. B. O. THE DB A WAS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR AS YOU ALL. PROBABLY KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME TRANSITION IN THE APPOINTMENT OF THE DVL AND SO THE IT IS CORRECT THEY DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON ON THIS BILL. AT LAST YOU THEY WERE TESTIFYING WITH THIS AND BUT WE'VE CONTINUED TO USE THE D. B. O. S. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN MOVING THIS FORWARD. GREAT. TWO SECONDS WELL KNOWN GERMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THE SHEPHERD AND HAS STATED VISOR WAY SO WHY IN THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTED. AB AT THIRTY TWO OH SEVEN LAST YEAR OF BILL THAT YOU MAKE COMMITMENTS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS MOVING FORWARD AND A PREPARATIONS UNFORTUNATELY THOSE ISSUES WERE RESOLVED LAST YEAR. WHEN HE GOT TO APPROPRIATIONS AND I BELIEVE THE BILL -- WAS HEALED -- FOR THOSE REASONS AND MAYBE SOME OTHER ONCE AGAIN WE'RE HERE A YEAR LATER AND IT'S THE SAME MEASURE BEFORE US THAT WE DEALT WITH. BEFORE IN THE SAME TWO ISSUES ARE STILL OUTSTANDING THE TIMING OF PROVIDING CONSUMER DISCLOSURE INFORMATION AND CLARIFYING THE BILLS APPLICATION TO TRIBES AND DESPITE THE DILUTION THERE I STILL DON'T BELIEVE BASED ON THE TESTIMONY WE'VE HEARD TODAY AN OPPOSITION THAT IT IS TRUST. THE TRIBAL CONCERNS -- THIS COMMITTEE ALSO ONCE AGAIN OFFERED UP TWO SETS OF AMENDMENTS THAT HE RESPECTIVELY -- REJECTED AND I RESPECT THAT AND NO ANIMOSITY THERE BUT BEING THE CASE I CAN'T SUPPORT TO MEASURE THE DAY I HAVE NO RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR BILL -- WITHOUT THOSE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AGAIN WERE MADE A LAST YEAR -- BY THIS COMMITTEE AND WAS SUPPORTED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND ALLOWING YOUR BUILD A MOVE FOR LAST YEAR SO. THAT'S WHERE I AM AS IT STATES TODAY IF -- MEMBERS ARE INCLINED TO MAKE A MOTION FOR THIS BILL I KNOW WHICH BACKED OUT BUT I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THE MEASURE TODAY. AND I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT I APPRECIATE A WE BUT EVERYBODY HAS IN FRONT OF THEM ARE. THERE ARE TEN SETS OF AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE TAKEN SINCE LAST YEAR -- ALL OF THEM HAVE INSISTS THERE I THINK THE POSITION FOR ME AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL IS DO I TAKE THE THE FINAL. TWO OUR ISSUES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE DISCLOSURES AND WHO PROVIDES THE DISCLOSURES -- AND WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT HAVE A RESOLUTION ON THAT AS WELL AS THE TRIBAL LANGUAGE WHICH THE AMENDMENTS REMOVE ALTOGETHER IF SOMEONE WANTS TRIBAL LANGUAGE IN THERE I THINK THAT THERE'S A WAY TO GET TO THOSE THINGS -- IF THERE IS AGREEMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT THAT'S THE LANGUAGE THEY WANT TO SEE THEIR SO I THINK IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN. CERTAINLY THE TWO AMENDMENTS THAT I DID NOT AGREE TO A YOU KNOW AS IT'S BEEN STATED ALSO THE ONES THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED OUR AMENDMENTS THAT I'VE TAKEN SPECIFICALLY FOR BY THIS COMMITTEE. THAT HAVE REQUESTED ME THAT HAVE REQUESTED OF THE OF ME OF THIS BILL -- SO THOSE ARE THE DATES THEY TOOK A AMENDMENTS FROM THIS COMMITTEE IS DO I TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS KNOWING THAT THAT IS NOT. GOING YOU KNOW. THAT DESPITE. DESPITE EVERYONE'S INTEREST IN WANTING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION TO THIS -- THE THERE IS CONCERN -- AND THEY WOULD LIKELY PUT THE POSITION IN A BILL OF NOT GETTING SIGNED IN THE FUTURE SO I I THINK THAT THAT'S A HARD. ONE AND THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT I HAVE. IN FRONT OF ME AND IT'S NOT THAT IS NOT I MEAN IF WE CAN FIND AGREEMENT I WOULD HAVE FOUND AGREEMENT WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND CERTAINLY -- IF THIS BILL DOESN'T MOVE FORWARD WILL BE BACK AT IT NEXT YEAR -- AS WELL NO AND WE RESPECT THAT AND AND I'M ALWAYS SAY THIS ISSUE THAT I THINK WE ALL FEEL IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSENSUS THAT WE COULD GET IT'S BEEN EXPRESSED BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FLASHER IN IT'S BEEN EXPRESSED AGAIN -- THIS YEAR IT'S BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE ADVOCATES AS WELL AS OPPONENTS THAT THERE IS A A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A SWEET SPOT THAT WE CAN REACH ON THIS MEASURE WE JUST HAVEN'T REACHED A TODAY SO. THAT'S WHERE MY POSITION IS BUT LIKE I SAY I HAVE NO IDEAL YES. CENTER CAPS ARE. I APPRECIATE THE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS AND AND THE CONCERNS AND I I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK ON SOMETHING FOR A REALLY LONG TIME TO GET IT TO A COMMITTEE AND THEN HAVE SOMEONE SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S A TWO YEAR BILL -- SO -- I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT THE GENTLEMAN THAT SPOKE I I'M I APOLOGIZE I MISSED IT. THE PRESENTATION PRESENTING MY OWN BILL IN HE ASSEMBLY BUT BUT MY CONCERN IS. WITH AN OMINOUS SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- I THINK THERE'S A REAL NEED IN THIS AREA AND SO I I I REALLY -- APPRECIATE YOU DING YOU TAKING THE TIME AND ENERGY TO DO WORK IN THE SPACE. THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE INDICATED THAT HE HAD NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE BACK IN YEAH. I DON'T NEED TO GET INTO ALL OF THAT BUT I THINK IT'S IT IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. WITH HIM WHETHER YOU AGREE OR NOT WITH HIS POSITION AND AT LEAST GIVE THEM A AM AN ANSWER SO THAT. HE CAN HEAR FROM YOU WHAT WHAT IT IT'S WHAT. WHAT YOUR POSITION IS ON HIS ON HIS ON THE FRAMEWORK THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT SO -- LIKE I SAID I MISSED A BIG PART OF IT AND I DO APOLOGIZE BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THIS IS IT THIS IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE IN IN THE BUSINESS FROM BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS THAT OTHERWISE ARE DOING. THE RIGHT THING -- BUT EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO PLAY BY THE SAME RULES AND SO -- FOR THAT REASON I'M I'M WILLING TO SPUR YOU TODAY. SENATOR DOURADO -- IT SOUNDS LIKE. IT'S CLOSER. EVEN IF IT'S NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE A NIGHT I THINK THAT. HOPEFULLY I HEARD YOU SAY YOU AGREED TO KEEP WORKING ON THE ISSUES THAT THE CHAIR HAS. HAS RAISED ARM ON THE RIBAL ISSUE OUR WORK DONE. TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY ISSUES FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A WAY TO GET THERE SO. SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THAT WE WE THE AMOUNT THE AMENDMENTS IN FRONT OF YOU DELETED SO THERE IS NO NEED TO EVEN MENTION IT TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT TO EVEN REFERENCE IT. IT'S DELETED -- AND IF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE TRIBES FIND THE RIGHT LANGUAGE WILL PUT IT IN I THINK THAT THIS IS. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT SO IF THERE IS LANGUAGE THAT IS AGREED UPON BY OUR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE TRIBES AND WE'LL PUT IT IN UNTIL THEN WE WON'T MENTION IT'S COMPLETELY DELETED. ANY FURTHER DEBATE CONSTRUCTION SITE -- MANAGER WHICH ARTICLES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOTH AGREE. BEEN MOVED BY CENTERED AROUSAL. AT I'D SELL RECOMMENDATION FROM CHAIRS SO IT'S I GUESS. PUT IN MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS -- TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS AS AMENDED. SPENCER CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. SENATOR BRADFORD NO. NO CHIANG. KAI ERA.
