00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:49.233
SOME QUEUE MANY COLLEGES DOING

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.768

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:07.352
OF THEM.

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:09.754
MY MY UNDERSTANDING IS --

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.289
WHERE THE --

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:13.491
THERE'VE BEEN --

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:14.892
BA'S THAT --

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:18.029
DISTRICTS OF TAKING ON THEY'VE

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:21.499
GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL --

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:24.235
I THINK WE HAD OUR FIRST A GROUP

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:26.704
OF GRADUATING CLASSES JUST THIS

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:26.938
PAST --

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:28.639
SPRING --

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:30.608
THERE WAS A LOT OF I KNOW THERE

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.543
WAS A LOT OF MEDIA COVERAGE OF

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:33.277
THOSE.

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:35.113
AND AND THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:37.281
DEFINITELY BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:38.683
WHEN I SAW BEFORE THAT SOME OF

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.817
THEM IN THE NORTH WERE NOT

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:41.452
SUCCESSFUL AT LEAST THE NUMBERS

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:42.487
WHEN?

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:43.354
IT FALLS FAR AS INVESTMENT.

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:44.922
SO WHAT AS THIS BILL GOES

00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:46.891

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:47.959

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.851

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:20.617
STUDENTS.

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:22.319
THIS UNDER STAFFING IS REAL AND

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:25.422
IT IS DANGEROUS. SEVEN SUICIDES

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:26.790
OCCURRED ON ONE OF THESE

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:28.292
UNDERSTAFFED CAMPUSES DURING THE

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:30.394
PAST WINTER QUARTER.

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:32.096
TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE YET

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:33.363
COUNSELORS IN THE CSU ARE

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.032
STRUGGLING TO BE SURE STUDENTS

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:36.700
NEED.

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:37.634
HIGH RISK STUDENTS ARE

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:39.369
PRIORITIZED BUT THAT LEAVES MANY

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:41.305
WAITING FOR HELP.

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:42.506
STUDENTS WAIT WEEKS AND

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:43.941
SOMETIMES MONTHS FOR TREATMENT

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:45.476
AND BY THEN STUDENTS TELL US

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:46.844
IT'S OFTEN TOO LATE.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.412
I AM VERY TROUBLED BY THE

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:50.147

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:55.619

00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:56.687

00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:58.288

MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER ISSUE.

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:39.356
AND IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:41.024

THIS MEANS THAT THE MOST OBVIOUS

00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:25.535
WAY TO EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH

00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:27.104

SPECIFICALLY FOR SEVERAL REASONS

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:28.137
FIRST OUR SCHOOLS DON'T PAY

MATT MENTIONED DOES NOT PROVIDE

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.371
