IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THE- BCP. NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ONLY HAVE. OKAY AND THE- ALLEY- ARM WE HAVE AND YOU THROW. IN MORNING SHARE- EUNICE ROW WITH THE L. A. L. AT WE FIND THAT MOST COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE WORKLOAD ESTIMATES AND THE NEED TO SELL FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS- HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING TWO COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL- I WON THE FIELD OPERATIONS COMPONENTS AND TO THAT PROGRAM SUPPORT COMMAND THEN- WITH REGARDS. FEEL COMPONENT IN THAT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE PROVE NINE FIELD OPERATIONS POSITIONS TO BE PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS TO INCREASE THE RATE OF WITNESSING AND- LEAST INSPECTIONS- CALCIUM HAS FILLED FOUR OF THESE POSITIONS AND THE PROPOSED TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET REQUEST TWENTY THREE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TO ADDRESS SIMILAR WORKLOADS- BUT BECAUSE THE DIVISION IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF. IMPLEMENTING THE CURRENT YEAR FUNDING. THIS KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THESE NEW RESOURCES- ON WITNESSING RATES AND LEASE INSPECTIONS ARE STILL UNKNOWN- AND THEREFORE IT APPEARS PREMATURE TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR FIELD OPERATIONS ACTIVITIES BEFORE. COLLEGE AND FIRST BILL THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED POSITIONS AND SECOND PROVIDE STATE ON HOW THE NEW RESOURCES HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED NESTING RAPES AND RELEASE INSPECTIONS- WITH HIS. TO THE PROGRAM SUPPORT COMPONENT TO PROTECT JOBS BECAUSE OVER PROVIDES LITTLE INFORMATION ON HOW THAT. REQUESTED POSITIONS FOR PROGRAM SUPPORT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN MEETING ITS INTENDED GOALS OF INCREASING ORGANIZATIONAL AND PROCESS EFFICIENCY. SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED THE GAPS IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEES. AND ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSED NOR DOES IT REALLY AT THAT ADDRESS- DESCRIBE THE I JUST HOW THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WITH ADDRESS. THESE GAPS THE FOR THESE TWO COMPONENTS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO JUSTIFY THE REQUEST. ABSENT ADDITIONAL JUSTIFICATION READ RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE PROPOSED POSITIONS AND FUNDING RELATED TO PROGRAM SUPPORT AND OPERATIONS. THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS POSTED BY CERTAIN TALK- YOU'VE GOT FIVE MORE POSITIONS TO FILL THIS FISCAL YEAR TO NOT JUNE THIRTIETH. SO WE DO HAVE SOME TIME. CAN YOU HELP US OUT ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO. FIND FINE. VIA G. ALL I GUESS IN IN. SECOND MORE FOR US CAL JAM WOOD DID ADDITIONAL TWENTY THREE REQUESTS CLEAN HOSMER DEPARTMENT DECLARE FIREARMS OUR BCP POSITION FROM THIS PAST YEAR. COULDN'T YEAH THANK YOU SUPERVISOR INTO CAN SHARE IN MEMBERS WEEK CURRENTLY WERE AUTHORIZED TWELVE POSITIONS IN THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WE HAVE ALREADY FILLED TEN OF THOSE POSITIONS THERE'S ONLY ONE FIELD POSITION THAT IS LEFT UNFILLED AT THIS TIME IN THAT POSITION ACTUALLY WAS OFFERED- AND IT ENDED UP NOT BEING ACCEPTED BY THE CANDIDATE SO WE ARE GOING BACK OUT FOR THAT POSITION SO RIGHT NOW THE COMPOSITION OF OUR POSITIONS WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL CALGENE HAS GOT THEIR VACANCY RATE DOWN 213% AND WITH ANOTHER TWENTY POSITIONS AN ACTIVE RECRUITMENT AND ONCE THOSE ARE FILLED COLLEGE MORE ACTUALLY BE DOWN TO A VACANCY RATE OF AROUND SIX PERCENT- I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT PROGRAM SUPPORT WILL BE DOING. FILLED UP SO THAT THE VACANCIES I THINK WE NOW HAVE SOME MORE CLARIFICATION- TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE ON THAT. ONE WE GO AHEAD WITH THE ON THE- SUPPORT STAFF. SURE THE FIVE POSITION PROGRAM SUPPORT- BURKE TO THE STAFF THAT- ACTIVITY STAFF AND BUDGET HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS IN THE PASSES OF NEW AUTHORITIES. HAS ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES OF GROWN SOME KEY ITEMS THAT THE NEW UPDATES IN THE WELLSTAR SYSTEM REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION SUCH AS LATE FEES ASSESSMENT PRODUCTION REPORTS- WE RECENTLY UPGRADED AND RELEASED NEW VERSIONS OF THE WELL START HAVE NEW CAPABILITIES AND NEW STAFF WORK. WE ALSO HAVE A HIGH VOLUME OF OPERATORS AND PUBLIC ENQUIRIES HAVE BEEN RESPONDED TO WE ALSO HAVE BEEN INCREASING OUR BONDING- AND NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS HAVE TO BE PROCESS AND CONFER CONFIRMS- THE COR MYSTERIES TASKS SUCH AS IT QUICK MANAGEMENT PROCUREMENT PERSONNEL TRANSACTION ADDITION CONTROL. WERE ALSO BEEN SUPPORTING NUMEROUS CONTRACTS OF BOTH THE TRACKING FEDERAL GRANTS- WITH THE PIPELINE HAS MATERIALS SAFETY GRANTS USEPA GRANTS. AT THIS THE U. S. C. PROGRAM THERE'S ALSO BEEN DOCUMENTED AGREEMENTS UNDER THE OC ARE BOTH ARE YOU A SEE THAT WELL STEM PROGRAM IT IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR DOCUMENTS. AND CREATING A CLEAR ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS AND THAT IMPACTS OUR RETENTION POLICY OR TERMS OF DOCUMENTATION OUR DIGITIZATION SO THOSE ARE- SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THOSE UP FIVE PROGRAM SUPPORT POSITIONS WOULD HELP SUPPORT THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL- FIRED OUR STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THIS OPEN AND WE'D- APPRECIATE IF WE GOT ALL THAT DETAIL INFORMATION DELIVER TO US IN THE CITY ALEJO COULD HAVE A CHANCE. MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OF A- SUPERVISOR AND TUCKER. THE DEPARTMENT PRESS WE CAN GET INTO JUST SLIGHTLY MORE D. JUST IN TERMS OF- WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE OF THE OF THE NEW DISTRICT FIELD OPERATIONS- TRYING TO GET A SENSE- ESPECIALLY FROM THE- LOS ANGELES AREA. PERSPECTIVE- HELLO HOW MANY PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN THAT IN THAT- IN THAT OPERATION ARE DOING ON SHORE FIELD INSPECTIONS WHERE SITE INSPECTIONS HOW HOW MANY PERSONNEL DO YOU HAVE WORKING ON THAT ADDED TO SOUTHERN OFFICE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO COLLEAGUES AT THE LONG BEACH OFFICE I SHOULD SAY RIGHT. IT IS OUR OUR SOUTHERN DISTRICT OFFICES BASED IN LONG BEACH THAT COVERS- SOUTH OF SANTA CLARITA TO THE MEXICAN BORDER ROUTES OF THE ARIZONA BORDER. I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC- CAL. OF FIELD STAFF IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT. BUT WE CAN GET THAT FOR YOU. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY CURRENTLY HAVE. OR OR PROJECTED TO HAVE OUR COMMUNITY WHO'S DOING ON IT OUR PEOPLE IN THAT OFFICE DOING ON SHORE INSPECTIONS IN GENERAL. THEY ARE WE DO HAVE ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR STAFF OR IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OFFICE. ABOUT THERE ARE TWO THIRDS OF THE FIELD DISTRICT IS OUT AND- BAKERSFIELD THE INLAND AREA THE MAJORITY OF THEM. BUT WE THEY DO DO WITH THE SAME OF BLOW OUT PREVENTERS- OF PLUGGING ABANDONED ORDERS. REWORKS OTHER REQUIRED- THAT ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BOTH MAINLY A LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY IS WHERE THE MAJORITY CURRENT OPERATIONS OCCUR. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE BECAUSE IT GIVEN THE SCOPE OF- THE REGULATIONS PENDING BEFORE CAL JAM- IN TERMS OF. INSPECTIONS ON NEIGHBORHOOD OIL-AND GAS DRILLING- IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO COVER. ALL THE WELL INSPECTIONS IN ALL THE SCOPE OF THAT WORK THAT IT'LL ENTAIL DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT. BEING A MAJOR FUTURE WORKLOAD THAT YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK TO US WITH THE WORD IS THE CURRENT B. C. P. ANTICIPATE. THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH ENFORCING THOSE REGULATIONS. THIS IS ANTICIPATED THE- THE BE ABLE TO ADDRESS OUR CURRENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THIS WILL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO GO AND INSPECT SITES OUT AND AT LEAST A THREE YEAR CYCLE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT AT THAT TIME AT THIS TIME WITH OUR CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS. SO THAT WILL BE AN IMPROVEMENT- WE'RE ALSO WILL BE OUT FOR MORE ENVIRONMENTAL. INSPECTIONS OF DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE AND THAT WILL ALLOW US ALSO PARTNER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND LIKE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO DO A JOB INSPECTIONS. BUT ONLY BASED ON THE CURRENT REGULATIONS NOT BASED ON PENDING REGULATIONS SO IN OTHER WORDS TO ACTUALLY ACTED THAT YOU TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE. THE RIGOR THAT YOU'VE PROPOSED FOR- FOR ALL THAT. YOU KNOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OIL AND GAS SITES THROUGHOUT THE LA AREA- IS THAT. IS THAT ANTICIPATED IN THIS. THIS CURRENT. BUDGET PROPOSAL. THIS THIS DOES NOT ANY OPINION. EXAMPLE PUBLIC HEALTH RULE MAKE. ONCE CONCLUDES WE WILL NEED TO SEPARATE- BUDGET PROPOSAL TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THAT NEW RULE. GIVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT THAT'LL ENTAIL. WE'VE NOT DONE THAT ANALYSIS YET. SO WE COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU PASSED A REGULATION AND THEN WE HAVE A ANOTHER SORT OF. I HAVE TO SPEND TIME MAKING A HIRING PUSH AND THEN. EVENTUALLY MADE IT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PACING OF ALL THIS. BECAUSE CURRENTLY THE LOCAL PARTNERS YOU MENTION LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS BUT IT'S BEEN A- COMPLETELY UNFUNDED EFFORT- AND IS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT LEAST IT'S STARTING TO CHANGE WE KNOW THERE WERE SOME REASON ACTIONS IT. DALY CITY IN L. A. COUNTY AS WELL AS VENTURA COUNTY AND A FEW OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT- UP TO THIS POINT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN RELYING ENTIRELY ON CAL JIM TO DO THE WORK AND- I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY STAFF THERE ARE BUT EVEN IF THEY WERE. ALL TWENTY THREE BIT WELL THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ALL TWENTY THREE POSITIONS BUT EVEN IF IT WERE HALF OF THOSE TWENTY THREE POSITIONS DOING ON SHORE IN THE REGION THAT WOULD BE. TWELVE PEOPLE TO COVER. ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. WELLS SO I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD EXPECTATIONS IS SET FOR THE FOLKS I REPRESENT IN TERMS OF. WHETHER IT'S GONNA BE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO GET THIS DONE IN THE NEAR TERM- OR WHETHER. THE STAKES THE STATE INTENDS TO SORT OF TAKE A- A PRIMARY ROLE IN IN THE SORT OF SURVEYING AND SITE INSPECTION IS. NOT TO MENTION ALL THE FINANCIAL LIABILITY AND YOU KNOW TITLE CHASING AND THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE THAT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN SO I KNOW WE'VE GOT A VERY AMBITIOUS GO FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF. PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT- BUT EVEN ON THE BASIC INSPECTION SIDE. I JUST HOPING TO GET A LITTLE MORE- GRANULARITY FOR ME ON THAT. YEAH WE- HAVE. WELL FUNDED POSITIONS OVER SEVENTY POSITIONS OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OFFICE- WE WILL HAVE TO GET THE BREAKDOWN OF. HOW MANY OUR INSPECTORS BUT- THEY GO OUT WE DO STATE STATUTES REGULATIONS. OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTS THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCES- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THERE IS IT AND UNFUNDED OR NO NO WATER NO ONE DOING THAT WE DO HAVE. THAT DOZENS OF PEOPLE DO THAT ACROSS LOS ANGELES- WE DO PARTNER VERY CLOSELY WITH. THE CITY OF LA THEY HAVE THEIR- THEIR CONTRACTOR MRS AND THEIR- DISTRICT TEAM THAT WE MEET WITH ON A MONTHLY BASIS- TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS THE SAME THING THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. WE HAVE A MONTHLY MEETINGS AND INTERACTIONS OF DATA SHARING THAT HAPPENS QUITE FREQUENTLY- PRIMARILY THROUGH THE- THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT OFFICE- CONTROL OF NATURAL GAS- BUT- I CAN'T. FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THEIR- THEY'RE FUNNY THEY'RE BECAUSE BUT WE DO HAVE. THE OF FOLKS ARE ON THE- EVERY DAY. ALEXANDER HAS AND. YEAH MR HOLE WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE CONTEXT ON KNOW ANY REGULATE. AND JUST I HAVEN'T MENTIONED THE FACT THAT AS THE DEPARTMENT GOES THROUGH THAT. THERE'S SECTIONS IN THERE FOR ECONOMIC IMPACTS FISCAL IMPACTS. IS EVERYBODY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. YOU KNOW WHAT SORT OF RESOURCES OR FUNDING MIGHT BE NEEDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ON THE STATE LEVEL AS WE GO THROUGH IT SO- IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT CAN BE PLANNED FOR. SOMETHING THAT CAN BE PLANNED FOR BUT ISN'T CURRENTLY BEING PLANNED FOR. CORRECT WELL IT'S PART OF THAT IS PART OF THE REGULATIONS PROCESS AS THE- DEPARTMENT WOULD GO THROUGH TO. TO LOOK AT WHAT THOSE REGULATIONS WOULD LOOK LIKE. THAT'S WHERE THE ESTIMATES FOR YOU KNOW POSITIONS MIGHT BE- PUT IN THERE OR WHAT SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS WOULD BE ON LOCALS. AND THERE'S TIME TO REVIEW THAT- REVISE IT AND BASICALLY PUT THAT IN CONTEXT BUT- IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO ASK FOR RESOURCES AHEAD OF THE ACTUAL REGULATIONS AND- SETTING THE REGULATIONS ASIDE THE ALMOST TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUESTS FROM THE GOVERNOR- ON THIS FRONT. D. OF THE PIT POSITIONS TO EXECUTE THAT PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT PROCESS- THAT'LL BE THERE WEDNESDAY I WOULD DEFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT ON SOME OF THOSE DETAILS I WOULD I WOULD NOTE THAT- AS PART OF THIS PACKAGE THERE IS. CLASS SIX POSITIONS FOR SB FORTY SEVEN THAT DOES A LOT OF THIS WORK- I KNOW THAT A DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO CONTRACT FOR COMPONENTS OUT OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AND THEN WE ALWAYS CONTINUE TO WORK YOU KNOW IF THE FUNDING IS IN PLACE. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TIME. YOU KNOW THAT ADDITIONAL. DELIVERABLES ARE WE NEED TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW WE CAN ALWAYS RETURN FOR. A SUBSEQUENT REQUEST BUT WE THINK THAT THE POSITIONS THAT APARTMENT HAS HERE IN THESE RESOURCES ARE ENOUGH TO GET THEM- MOVING ON THAT FUNDING. I JUST MAKE ONE FINAL COMMENT AT- I WOULD I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING SOME OF THAT DATA BACK BUT- AS SOMEBODY WHO JUST. LITERALLY WENT THROUGH- OIL SPILL- RIGHT BEHIND THE- SYNAGOGUE MY FAMILY GOES TO WITH MY BABY AND NINETY FOUR YEAR OLD FATHER IN LAW AND WATCHING OIL- POUR INTO AN ALLEY- RIGHT OFF STILL HEANEY IN THE HEART OF PICO- THAT SITE. HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY INSPECTED OVER THE YEARS- AND WHETHER IT'S THE- THE LACK OF EFFORT FROM THE CITY OR BIG OR CAL JAM DEFERRING TO THE CITY. THERE'S NOW AN INCIDENT REPORT AND YOU YOU HAD CONTRACTORS IN FOLKS SHOW UP AFTER- THE DAMAGE WAS DONE BUT IT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW. DEEP LONG TERM HISTORY OF CORROSION ON A VERY ACTIVE VERY VERY- NEIGHBORHOOD. URBAN OIL SITE- WHERE NOW WE'RE JUST PLAYING CLEANUP MODE SO THE CONCERN IS THAT IF THE CITY'S. NOT EXECUTING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES THERE I WONDER PLANNING AND ZONING RULES AND THEN YOU ALSO ONLY HAVE SAY TWELVE PEOPLE THE COVER ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND WELLS AND- IN THE REGION- HOW MANY MORE OF THESE THESE LEAKS ARE WE GONNA SEE AN- IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S WERE FULL THAT'S- YOU KNOW. THAT'S WHAT LA IS SO I'D LOVE TO SEE OF AS A MORE DATA ABOUT HOW MANY INSPECTIONS YOU ALL PLAN TO COVER- IN THE REGION AND BY WHAT DATE. AND HOW THAT WILL INTERFACE WITH- WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORK THERE TO GIVE THE COMMUNITIES A SENSE OF. WILL THIS JUST BE A REACTIVE FORCE THAT SHOWS UP SOARED AFTER THE FACT ARE WE GONNA- IS THE GOLDACTUALLY HAVE- INSPECTIONS ON EVERY SINGLE SITE IN THE REGION THAT STAYS CLOSE TO FOLKS- HOW THINK. THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW THAT PROCESS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN IN STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO KEEP THE MATTER OPEN SO WE HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE WILL PASS IT ON TO SENATOR STERN CENTER DOLLY RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU A- MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL FALL WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUES TALKING ABOUT SO I I'VE BEEN TALKING THIS POSITIONS AND VACANCIES FOR. THE LAST TWO YEARS WHAT SO. I WANTED IS NO NO THEY MIGHT MY INFORMATION SHOWS THAT WE ARE YOU HAVE A ABOUT A FIFTEEN PERCENT- VACANCY RATE WHICH IS ABOUT FIFTY THREE POSITIONS AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR AGAIN- MORE POSITIONS AND SO WHAT WHAT IS THE ISSUE WITH GETTING THESE POSITIONS FILLED SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THE WORK IN. IN THE FILM. YEAH THANK YOU SIR- THAT 50% OR THE TIME STAMP FROM THIS PAST DECEMBER AND COREY WE'RE AT A LOWER RATE NOW. THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED MORE THAN FIFTY HIRING THIS YEAR. UNF UNFORTUNATE FORTUNATELY- ABOUT- HALF TO TWO THIRDS OR A PROMOTIONAL HIGHER SO CREATES NEW VACANCIES WHICH POSITIONS ARE FILLED. OUT THE THAT'S BEEN THE ONE ONE CHALLENGER THAT WOULD WITH OUR NON WORK AFTER PER- PROJECT TO GET TO SEE PERCENT IN THE NEXT. FEW WEEKS ABOUT RECORDS SHOW THAT. OVER THE PAST EIGHT BUDGET CYCLES THE VACANCY RATE HAS BEEN. EXCUSE ME ABOUT 17% AND SO AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA GET THESE POSITIONS FILLED AND I ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR. FOR THE FRACKING UNIT WHICH HAS SIXTY FULL TIME. THE STAFF THAT. WERE NOT INITIALLY ISSUE IN FRACKING PERMITS SO WHAT OF THOSE SIXTY STAFF DOING. WE DID ISSUE TWELVE FRACKING PERMITS LAST YEAR- THE STAFF CONTINUE TO DO A VARIETY OF THINGS- RECENTLY ISSUED- ONE OF OUR LARGEST VIOLATIONS A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THEIR ENERGY ON- USING CHEMICALS THAT WERE NOT APPROVED OF FRACKING. ACTIVITIES THAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE CONTINUE TO INSPECT AND WITNESS- THE ON SITE OF THE POSITIONS COVER A VARIETY- OF CATEGORIES SUCH AS LEGAL ADMINISTRATIVE- DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENGINEERS AND GEOLOGISTS. OTHERS ONGOING WORK RELATED- REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF PERMITS BUT WERE ALSO SEEN A DECLINE IN APPLICATION APARTMENTS AND SO- YOU KNOW WE WE'RE ONLY RESPONSIVE TO WHAT COMES IN AND PERMITS ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH. GLOBAL- PARTNERS. WELL TODAY OR HIT A HUNDRED DOLLARS A BAY SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE HOPEFULLY SOME DEPENDENCE ON- NATIONWIDE HERE THAT WE ACTUALLY CANHAVE SMALL INDEPENDENTLY SO HOPING SOME OF THOSE PERMITS WILL ACTUALLY BE- RELEASED IN CALIFORNIA SO WE CAN- NOT. NOT DEPEND ON- OTHER NATIONS FOR OIL SO I HAVE ON A WEAK YES THIS ISSUE TWENTY FOUR WE'RE GONNA GO TO TWENTY FIVE NEXT BECAUSE I DO HAVE SOME QUESTION ON THE TWO THANK YOU. RIGHT FIVE SO WE WILL KEEP ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY FOUR OPEN TO MOVE ONTO ASIAN NUMBER TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR ORAL L. ABATEMENT AND REMEDIATION A HUNDRED MILLION FROM GENERAL FUND THIS FISCAL YEAR HUNDRED MILLION NEXT YEAR AND SOME UNKNOWN ABOUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MR AND TALK OR SUPERVISOR AND TOOK YOU RECOGNIZE- THIS. FUNNY WOULD HELP MITIGATE THE STATE'S- LIVE IN FOR. I'LL JIM- FOCUS ON HEALTH THEM. THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING IF IT'S CLEAR TO TWO TWENTY THREE ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR- FROM THE GENERAL FUND ZERO ZERO ONE. THE PLAY IN A BAND AN ORPHAN- DESERTED WELLS- ONLY GAS WELLS IN THE COMMISSION ASSOCIATED FACILITIES THAT COULD POSE A THREAT TO LIVE HEALTH WATER QUALITY WILDLIFE AND NATURAL RESOURCES LEFT UNDER MEDIATED THESE WALLS AND SO CITY FACILITIES CAME COULD CONTAMINATE WATERWAYS SOIL SERVE AS A SOURCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AIR POLLUTANTS. AND PREVENT PHYSICAL HAZARDS TO PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE THEY MAY LEAVE OIL UNDERGROUND INJECTION FLUIDS FORMATION WATER INTO NEARBY UNDERGROUND SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER AND RELEASE METHANE HYDROGEN SULFIDE AND OTHER GASES INTO BOTH GROUNDWATER AND OR THAT MR. BASED ON THE NUMBER WAS CABS IN THE DIGNIFIED AS LIKELY HAVING NO RESPONSIBLE OPERATOR THE AVERAGE COST OF THE BUDGET AMENDMENT THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE FULLY EXPENDED AND MAKE AN IMPORTANT IMPACTS. ADDITIONALLY SENSE- THIS IS INTRODUCED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THEIR PHASE ONE OF FUNDING UNDER THE FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR AT NATIONAL CENTER OR FOR WELL PROGRAM PHASE ONE INCLUDED ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE STILL IS AN ADDITIONAL THREE AND A HALF BILLION THAT HAS NOT BEEN ALLOCATED. IN PHASE ONE- CALIFORNIA WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S SPREAD OVER TWO CATEGORIES- WE WERE GIVEN THE MAXIMUM ELIGIBILITY FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION- AND- INITIAL GRANTS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE LATER THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL- HUNDRED AND. FORTY MILLION AND- OF THE FORM GRANT AREA THE HAS YET TO BE- AND COMMUNITY HOW HOW TO FOR THAT MIGHT BE IT REALLOCATED BUT WE WOULD. ELIGIBLE FOR THE- THOSE FUNDS- AND THAT THAT JUST OUT WITH END OF- THIRTY FIRST THE PART OF INTERIOR. SO THIS TWO HUNDRED MILLION WOULD HELP US MAXIMIZE- THE MATCHING GRANTS PORTION OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT PREDICATED ON INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDS- I'M PLUGGING ABANDONED ACTIVITIES. SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS YEAH MAYBE FINANCE YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION IS. THE IS THE MONEY THE HUNDRED MILLION THEY'RE ASKING FOR THIS YEAR FOR THAT REMAINDER THREE POINT SIX BILLION THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS COMING UP IS THAT IS THAT. THE MATCHING PORTION. OR IF YOU COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT. BURKE HI ANDREW AT THE PAR IN A PLAN. AND WE ARE AT THE THERE IS A COME OF THE THAT WOULD A FOR- AS A STATE MATCH FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDING I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME DETAILS- THEY WERE WAITING FOR ON EXACTLY HOW MUCH THAT WILL BE- BUT THEY- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IS. THIS POTENTIAL LIABILITY OF UP TO A BILLION DOLLARS NEEDED TO CLEAN THIS UP. AND THAT WERE USING A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH OF- INDUSTRY FUNDS AND FEES- THE STATE GENERAL FUND AND THEN THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO REALLY TRY TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON SOMETHING THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE AN ISSUE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. CALIO DEGREE WITH THAT. THANK YOU TO- IN THIS ROW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS REGARDING THIS PROPOSED LAW AND FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL IN CONTEXT OF THE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE ON- AS MENTIONED BY THAT ADMINISTRATION. I'M THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS MENTIONED BY THE DEPARTMENT THAT AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE STATE'S ESTÁ MATED AND TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR AT LEAST A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION- AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THE STATE IS LIKELY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR. MORE FUNDS IN THE COMING MONTHS AS- ADDITIONAL FEDERAL GUIDELINES ARE RELEASED AND SO GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS LIKELY AVAILABLE FOR WELL OVER MEDIATION AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE DEGREE TO WHICH ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES- IS A PRIORITY. ATTOSECOND IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL LIKE TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL STATE FINDS. WE RECOMMEND CONSIDERING REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PROPOSED FUNDING ESPECIALLY JUST GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE. AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE CURRENT WILL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES OVERSEEN BY COLLEGE AND- AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE DIVISION HAS THE CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER SUCH A LARGE INCREASE IN STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING WITHIN THE EXISTING RESOURCES. THIS GIVEN THEIR NUMEROUS OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL LIKE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STATE FINDS IT MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING PROPOSED AND TARGETING THE FINES INSTEAD TO AND WHILE AND DISABILITY RESEARCH TO VERIFY A KIND OF WALDRON LOCATION ASSESSED FACILITIES AND SEEK OWNERSHIP DOCUMENTATION. OR REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE AMOUNT THAT REQUIRED FOR MATCHING FUNDS TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL. FUNDING VERY RECOMMEND CONCERT ALTER SOURCE OF FIVE. AND INSTEAD OF THESE. DURING THE JAN FUND PROPOSED. THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONTINUE FUNDING AT WELL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WITH SPECIAL FUNDS. SUCH AS THE OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL UNLESS YOU'RE FINE AND THE HAZARDOUS AT AWHILE ABATEMENT. THAT ARE CURRENTLY FUNDING SIMILAR WORK. AND DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THE LEGISLATURE DECISIVE PURPOSE FOR THIS PURPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CURRENT FUND BALANCE IN THE SPECIAL FUNDS ARE SUFFICIENT. AND FINALLY WE RECOMMEND REQUIRING REPORTING ON KEY PROGRAM HOW KINDS AND IF FUNDING IS APPROVED WE RECOMMEND AND TO ADOPT SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO PROBE. REPORT ANNUALLY AND OR UNTIL THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN FULLY EXPENDED. ON EXPENDITURES A NUMBER OF WALLS IDENTIFIED AND REMEDIATED FEDERAL FUNDS AWARDED. AND SOME QUANTIFIABLE BENEFITS OF REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AND- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF OLDER MEDIATION WORK DONE BY THE DIVISION WOULD BE HELPFUL- TO A LEGISLATURE IN DETERMINING WHETHER ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. YOU TOO CAN QUESTIONS YET MISS WROTE DO YOU THINK. KELCHEN HAS THE HORSES TO DO THE WORK GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT MAY BE COMING THROUGH THE DOOR IF WE JUST FOCUSED ON THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE WELL HEAD RESEARCH AND THE THIRTY MILLION FOR THE FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS THAT'S ALMOST TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE WE GET TO THE- COMPETITIVE THREE POINT ONE. WILLIAM A AND WHAT A LET'S LET'S JUST STIPULATE IT'S AGREEABLE TO VALUABLE THING TO DO YOU THINK THEY COULD ACTUALLY GET IT DONE IN THE FISCAL YEAR. OR IS THAT THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN REMEDIATION WILL BE SPENDING. TWO MILLION DOLLARS. A YEAR. WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON JUST THE HORSES. THE BODIES THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THE WORK. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIR AND SAID THE DEPARTMENT HAS INDICATED BY- A LOT OF THE ACTUAL BY WELDER MEDIATION ACTIVITIES WILL BE DONE BY EXTERNAL CONTRACTORS AND THEY PLAN ON USING- A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTORS AB. ONE TO KIND OF MANAGE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION- AND SECOND HERE ALSO ACTUALLY DO THAT WILL MEAN THE SHACK TODAY'S AND THIRD TO DO SOME OF THE RESEARCH WORK. THAT BEING SAID- I DO THINK THAT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AS YOU MENTIONED HAVE CONCURRENT WELL MEANING EACH AND ACTIVITIES. AND JUST GIVE IN THIS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OTHER OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HOUSING DOES HAVE AND- IT BAG IT IS AN ISSUE OF CONCERN THAT- IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER WHETHER THE DIVISION WILL HAVE SIX I'M JUST SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO DO ALL OF THAT WORK ADD. TO PROCESS ALL THE FEDERAL SPENDING BILL AND NOT LET ALONE THAT ADDITION STATE FUNDS YEAH ARE I MEAN ARE WE- HIGHLIGHTS WHAT UTAH ABOUT WITH THE CONTRACTING BUT THEY HAVE ZERO. CAL JIM EMPLOYEES TO DO TO DO THIS OVERSIGHT SO I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES HAD SOME QUESTIONS ON THE PREVIOUS ONE OF COLLECTORS CENTER DOLLY FIRST. THANK YOU SO DEPARTMENT. OF FINANCE- THE- DID THEIR WORST MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS OUT OF THE H. I. DOUBLE A. FUND INTO TWENTY. AND THE MONEY WASN'T PUT BACK IN THAT. THE ACCOUNT IS FULLY FUNDED BY OIL PRODUCERS. AND REQUIRED BY CAL JIM TO PLUG HAZARDOUS ORPHAN WELLS. LORD KNOWS WE HAVE ORPHAN WELLS TO PLUG IN THE STATE. BUT THE MONEY IS TAKEN OUT WHICH IS FUNDED BY OIL PRODUCERS WHERE WHY IS THAT MONEY BEEN RATED FROM CAL JIM. FIRST THIS IS ANDREW HOLTZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM. YEAH THERE WAS THAT THERE WERE QUITE A FEW FUNDS- DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMICS THAT WERE TEMPORARILY LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND. THIS WAS ONE OF THEM IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BE REPAID IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- THE FUNDING QUESTION IS SOMETHING THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED AND WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REPAY THE LOAN SOONER IF THE FUNDS ARE NEEDED. AND SO YOUKNOW IF THE DEPARTMENT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH ITS EXPENDITURES THIS YEAR AND IT TURNS OUT THAT MORE QUICKLY THAN WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED WE CAN DO THAT. SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON THE RECORD HERE I AM VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF KALENJIN- I WAS A BELIEVE THE ONLY REPUBLICAN. IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT VOTED FOR SB FOUR WHICH WAS A PAVLEY BILL THEY SAID WE'RE GOING TO REGULATE OIL AND GAS PRODUCER'S IN CALIFORNIA TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE PUTTING IN THE GROUND I BELIEVE I WAS ONLY ONE BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE. DOING A BETTER JOB. WE HAVE CAL JIM THAT A 100% FUNDED BY OIL PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA. BASF TO EVERY CELLPHONE THE TOILET PAPER IN THEIR OFFICE IS ALL FUNDED BY- PRODUCERS. WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED NEW APPLICATIONS. FOR PERMITS HOW MANY OF THOSE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ISSUED- OVER THE LAST FOUR FIVE MONTHS SUPERVISOR AND TALK. THANK YOU SENATOR WE DO HAVE A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES A COME TO A DIVISION- BOTH FROM GEOTHERMAL OPERATIONS DO A THERMAL OPERATORS AS LONG AS WELL AS UNDERGROUND STORAGE OPERATORS LIKE THE GENIE SOCALGAS WE ALSO GET SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE PIPELINE HAZARDOUS RICHARDS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION- FOR UNDERGROUND STORAGE FACILITY OVERSIGHT- BUT WE'LL AND THEN WE ALSO DO HAVE A SHARE. OF THAT'S ALSO PAID BY PRODUCERS- PER YOUR QUESTION ON WHAT PERMITS WITH FISH. WE CONTINUE TO PER- JUST IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS WE'VE ISSUED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND PERMITS. IN PARTICULAR- FORTY NINE A NEW DRILLING PERMITS THE RECENT- INCREASE AND MAYBE CALL BACKLOG OF PERMITS HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF THE KERN COUNTY ON THE GAS ORGANS BEING SUSPENDED FOR A SECOND TIME. ACTUALLY INTO A TWENTY TWENTY IT WAS OVERTURNED ALTOGETHER. IS GOING TO DO TO THE COURT PROCEDURES KERN COUNTY IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND SO OUR DIVISION HAS- ANNOUNCED EARLIER WAS A RESULT OF THE SURPRISED COURT HEARING TAKING ON LEAD AGENCY ROLL ACROSS KERN COUNTY WHICH IS WHERE SEVENTY PERCENT. OF OPERATIONS OCCUR AND MEMORABLE MAJORITY OF OUR PERMITTING COMES AND SO THAT ANY WORKLOAD IS BEING PROCESSED- PRIORITIZE WE MET WITH OPERATORS- AND WE'RE COLLECTING DOCUMENTATION AND SO THAT'S A NEW PROCESS AND- IT'S BASICALLY ALMOST A YEAR'S WORTH OF PERMITTING CAME IN ABOUT A THREE MONTH PERIOD. AND SO WE'RE WORKING THROUGH IT AND HAVE A GAME PLAN TO. CONTINUE TO THE PROCESSOR AND ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT REVIEW OF ALL THE PERMITS A. COMPUTER WELL TAKE YOU FOR THAT BUT I'M JUST CAN IT ON MY OWN TIME I JUST WANT TO A THIS. SO MUCH FROST WITH THE THAT. IS ALL LIKE THE ADMIN. HAS YOU KNOW BAND PRODUCTION IN CAL- WORK TOWARDS AT WE DON'T IS PERMITS. WE CAN'T GET OUR POSITIONS FILLED AND WE'RE NOT DOING WHAT THE PUBLIC IN THIS LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY PASSED IN LAW IT IS TO PLUG THESE ORPHAN WELL SO THAT WE- DON'T HAVE A LIABILITY OF OUR ENVIRONMENT OUT THERE. AND THE I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE NOW THREE YEARS AND- THE ABILITY TO NOT GET THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO DO IT THAT THE SENATOR FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING. AND AT THE SAME TIME. WE USE LIKE WHAT IS IT ONE POINT EIGHT. MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE A DAY IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE US BE PRODUCING THAT IT A CLEAN SAFE WAY IN OUR OWN STATE CREATING JOBS HERE. THAN RELYING ON. FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO BRING IN OUR FUEL. IN OUR BOOK AND OUR OILS. SO WE HAVE TO SOMEHOW GET TO WORK ON THE GROUND AND GET THESE PROJECTS. PERMITTED AND DONE. AND CAUGHT AND AT THE SAME TIME STOP. CHARGING THE OIL PRODUCERS THAT ARE HERE AND NOT. GETTING THE WORK DONE YOU'RE CHARGING BUT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE YOU'RE ALL THESE POSITIONS ARE PAYING FOR BUT THEY'RE NOT EVEN FIELD. AND THAT'S DRIVING UP THE COST OF OIL AND GAS IN CALIFORNIA. SO I'LL BE WATCHING THIS CLOSELY AND I'M I'M IS TO TELL YOU YOU HAVE YOUR PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN HORRIBLE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE CAN'T GET THE POSITION IS FILLED WE CAN GET THE WORD AND YOU'RE DIVERTING FUNDS AWAY FROM IT FOR OTHER REASONS THAT SHOULD BE FOCUSED IN THOSE AREAS. CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'LL JUST I GUESS YOU'RE A RESUME MY- LAST LINE A QUESTION NOW THAT IT'S- RICHARD MORIN POINT HERE WITHIN THIS THIS CURRENT WELL REMEDIATION PROPOSAL- HOW MANY WELLS. DO YOU ALL ANTICIPATE- WITH A REMEDIATING AND PLUGGING IN UNDER THIS UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. WE- WE'VE IDENTIFIED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED WELLS AS BLUE OKAY I WE WOULD HAVE A FIVE FIFTY THREE HUNDRED WELLS AS- A CURRENT UNAVAILABLE. FOR FEDERAL FUNDING MATCH A PART OF THE FUN. OF THE PERCENT OF IT COVER A MINISTER COSTS SUCH AS A- AND- THE END OVERSIGHT- WE FIND HERE WHICH WE HAVE ARE AB COST NOW THE AND SIX. THAT HER BAND- WHICH US ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED WELLS WOULD BE- WOULD BE A AT LEAST AT LEAST GENERAL'S BE ABLE TO BE. AMENDED UP WITH A TWO HUNDRED MILLION IT'S GOING TO MILLION IT IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE ENTIRE. COSTS ARE ESTIMATED AT FIFTY THREE HUNDRED IS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. TO ABANDON- THE WELLS REMOVE IT MEANT. I TAKE SPECIALS PIPELINES AND CLEAN UP THE SITES. WHAT THE- OKAY N. N. ELLIE- JUST CURIOUS YOUR PURSE HERE. BASED N THE ON SUPERVISORS. OR YOUR OWN. AT ED I'M IN THE AND WHAT YOUR COST IS SORRY MANY WELLS WILL B REMAIN UNDER THIS PRO DURING AND WHAT TIME. I'M WELL AT I THINK A ACCORDING TO ABOUT THAT COST YOU A REMEDIAL AND IS ABOUT A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED ELEVEN DOLLARS AND CELEBRATE AND AS WE JUST HEARD GRANTED AGUIAR-CURRY SO YOU JUST YOU'RE USING THEIR NUMBERS GOT IT OKAY SO- AND SO JUST TO BE CLEAR TO THIS THE YOU OF THE FIFTY HUNDRED WELLS THAT YOU CITED WHICH YOU THINK MAYBE TAKE CARE OF. SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO A FIFTH OFTHAT- OR MAYBE A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT- SO. FOUR FIFTHS SEWER YOU KNOW. ROUGHLY PERCENT OF ALL THE WELL WILL STILL BE LEFT ON REMEDIATED AND CAPT AND THEN THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY DOESN'T INCLUDE. THE ABANDON- WELL AS NECESSARILY RIGHT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. TO GET ACTUALLY REACH DESERTION AND THAT DETERMINATION YOU'RE ONLY TAKING THE UNIVERSE OF THINGS WHERE YOU FOUND YOU'VE EXHAUSTED YOUR TITLE SEARCH AND- AND SORT OF SAID THERE IS NO VIABLE OPERATOR HERE. THAT THE UNIVERSE THAT YOU'RE SURE TO WORKING WITHIN. THE FIFTY THREE HUNDRED WHAT IS THE FULL UNIVERSE THAT WE STILL CAN DO TITLE SEARCH THOUGH AFTER A FORMER OPERATORS- ARE KERN OPERATORS THAT MAY HAVE TRANSFERRED WELLS AFTER NINETEEN NINETY SIX. WE STILL HAVE THOSE WITH ORTIZ DO THAT WITH WITH ALL OF THESE WALLS. SO BUT THAT HOW MANY WHY Y. NINETEEN NINETY SIX. OTHER DISPATCHABLE RESOURCE CODE THAT IS- WELLS OUR OPERATIONS WERE TRANSFERRED AFTER NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE PREVIOUS OPERATORS POSSIBLE A TWO EXAMPLES OF THAT IS LIKE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE CORPORATION THAT WAS FORMED- RECENTLY WAS A SPIN OFF OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM ALL OF THE C. OR C. WELLS IF BY CHANCE A SEARS HE WENT AWAY WE COULD STILL GO AFTER ARSENAL PETROLEUM- TO PAY FOR ALL THAT PLAYED A BAND ACOSTA. AND OF AN EXAMPLE THAT IS PLATFORM HOLLY THAT WERE FORMERLY EXXON MOBILE OPERATED PLATFORM BEFORE- STRANGER THE BANCO THEY WENT BANKRUPT EXXONMOBIL'S PAINT SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TOWARDS A CLEAN UP COSTS BY FROM HOLLY RIGHT NOW BUT I'M SORRY I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID YOU THEY ARE NOT. LIABLE BEFORE NINETY SIX- BEFORE NICE YES. WE THE TRANSFER HAS TO HAPPEN SORRY SORRY FROM GOOD MY TUMMY I HAVE TO HAPPEN- THEY WERE THE OWNER OF- NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND THEN THEY THEY TRY OUT NINETY NINETY SIX. THE PREVIOUS OWNER IS STILL RESPONSIBLE. RIGHT TO THE PREVIOUS IN OTHER WORDS THE PREVIOUS OWNER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IF THEY'VE TRANSFERRED OWNERSHIP. BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY SIX SO ALL THE MAJOR INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS IN THE STATE MOST OF WHICH- WERE PREVIOUSLY RUN BY A OIL MAJORS. THE MAJORS OUT THERE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY OF THOSE OPERATIONS OF THE TAXPAYERS HAVE TO PICK UP THE TAB FOR EVERYTHING- PRIOR TO THAT NINETY SIX IF YOU CAN'T FIND A VIABLE OPERATOR TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS. IN SOME INSTANCES THAT WOULD BE CORRECT. THAT'S MY UNDERLYING CONCERN HERE IS THAT ACCORDING THIS THE CCSD REPORT I THINK LAST YEAR TWO YEARS AGO NOW. WE'VE GOT OVER A YOU KNOW AROUND A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY IS THE STATE'S FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. I THINK THAT THAT THE BROADER NUMBER BEYOND JUST DESERTION TO ABANDONMENT THAT HASN'T RUN ITS COURSE ON THE TITLE SEARCHES IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS NOT IN THE THOUSANDS AND THEN- OTHERS BEYOND THAT I THINK IS EVEN HIGHER. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WELLS IN THIS STATE SO THE CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE OVER PROMISING AND UNDER DELIVERING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT- THOSE SITES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT- HAVE BEEN PLAGUING THEM FOR MANY YEARS- AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLAN IS AT THIS POINT. TO DO IT ALL ON TAXPAYER FUNDING- SO IS THERE ANY OPENNESS OR INTEREST IN THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKING THAT NOT JUST FROM A GENERAL FUND LIABILITY BUT TO ACTUALLY- LOOK AT THE L. OPERATORS WHO MAYBE HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF CAPITAL OUTTHERE BUT- BECAUSE OF WHATEVER NINETEEN NINETY SIX WORK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- ARE SUDDENLY NOW EXEMPT FROM LIABILITY. THE ORDER WAS GREAT- REAL PRESENT IN THE MEDIA- ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD OF LIFE UNDER MEDIA THESE WELLS OF SETTLERS TO CONTINUE TO. CONTAMINATE WATERWAYS SOIL A PRIVATE SOURCE OF CLIMB IN AIR POLLUTANTS IN VIA A PHYSICAL HAZARD THE PEOPLE IN THE WILDLIFE- THIS IS A ONE TIME EXPENDITURE- THAT WOULD BE THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING TO. BE ABLE TO DO MORE THAN WE'VE EVER DONE. IN THE PAST- JUST IN THE LAST DECADE WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO ABANDON. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN WELLS- WE WOULD PRIORITIZE- URBAN AREAS OF OUR MENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS. THERE ARE LOCATIONS WE KNOW OF- THEY HAVE OIL ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW OF THE WELLS IN PUBLIC PARKS. IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THAT. ARE SITTING THERE RIGHT NOW AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO DRESS. IF WE DO DO NOTHING- OUR OUR CURRENT SCHEDULE WOULD BE MORE THAN A CENTURY UNTIL WE CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. YEAH AND THIS WOULD BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL- INVESTMENT IN A GENERATION TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE LONGSTANDING CONCERNS. A BLAZE IN A COMMUNITY HAZARDS MARK I APPRECIATE THAT YEAH FINANCE HAD THEIR HAND UP YEP THIS WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE OIL AND GAS AND GEOTHERMAL ADMINISTRATIVE FINE AND THE HAS IT IS AN IDOL- DESERTED WELL ABATEMENT FUND. WHICH ESSENTIALLY REMEDIATE ABOUT ELEVEN WELLS A YEAR THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE FUNDS PAYING. FOR MISTER HALL. THANK YOU CHAIR. YES I WAS JUST I WAS GO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE YOU KNOW SENATE BILL FOR SEVEN. DIGEST AND- THE NOT TO EXCEED AMOUNT- UP TO FOR MILLION. FOR WELLS. THERE ARE A FEW OTHER I AM SPECIAL FUNDED SOURCES AS WELL. BUT TO PUT IN CONTEXT. YOU KNOW THIS GENERAL FUND AMOUNT WOULD BE THERE AS THE STATE MATCH- FOR WHATEVER MONEY WE POTENTIALLY WOULD GET OUR WAY. BUT IF WE WERE GONNA TRY TO GET AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING IF YOU WERE TO SAY GOING TO DO THIS BE A FEES INSTEAD OF GENERAL FUND. IT WOULD BASICALLY DOUBLE YOU KNOW THE FEE ASSESSMENT THAT'S PAID. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT HAS ABOUT AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION OF JUST OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS WOULD BASICALLY BE DOUBLING THAT IF WE WERE GONNA TRY TO DO THE SAME PACE AND SCALE. SO IN OTHER WORDS. LET ME JUST I JUST WANTED HONEA JUST TO FINAL ISSUE SO I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY WELLS ARE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND S. STATEWIDE EVEN THOUGH THIS IS IT IN YOUR WORDS A HUGE INVESTMENT AND THEN. SECONDARILY YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE INDUSTRY MATCH YOU WANT THE TAXPAYERS TO PAY FOR THE FULL COST OF THIS CLEANUP EFFORT EVEN THOUGH THE INDUSTRY IS EXEMPT FROM LIABILITY FOR EVERYTHING- BEFORE NINETY SIX SO THAT THERE THERE IS NO INTENTION AT THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK FOR INDUSTRY MATCH HERE. THIS IS ALL GOING TO BE THE PROPOSAL JUST PURE PUBLIC FUNDING TO HANDLE ALL THIS. WE DO A IT IS VERY MIXING THE EXISTING FUNDING A APPROPRIATIONS THAT DO COME FROM THE INDUSTRY BUT NOT NOT FUNDING SAYING EXISTING FUNDING WHICH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT DOES ABOUT ELEVEN WELL SO THEY PUT IN FIVE MILLION WE PUT IN A HUNDRED MILLION. THAT THAT'S ABOUT THE MATH HERE. BUT WAS IT IS ENROLLED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD I WOULD ONE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE AT THIS GENERAL FUND IS A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION WHEREAS THE INCREASE THAT JUST HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF SB FORTY SEVEN WILL BE ONGOING EVERY YEAR I UNDERSTAND OKAY AND WE COULDN'T FIND AS WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER OF WHAT WE THINK THAT ACTUAL INCREASE WE NOTE TODAY. THURS ELEVEN FOUR TWO MILLION BUT THAT MAY BE MORE AS DEPENDING ON THE ACTIVITIES THAT GO ON ON THE FIELD RIGHT. ISN'T OKAY SENATE. YET SO BUT JUST JUST SO I'M CLEAR THAT'S THAT'S I GET THAT IT'S ONGOING BUT IT'S FIVE MILLION FROM INDUSTRY AND THEN THE PROPOSAL IS ONE HUNDRED MILLION. FROM THE TAXPAYERS OVER ACTUALLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS FROM TAXPAYERS. FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ABOUT RIGHT. YES I'M GIVING ONE TIME GENERAL FUNDS YELLS OKAY UNDERSTOOD AND THEN AND HOW MANY WELLS DO YOU THINK WILL BE LEFT BEHIND AMONGST THE- ABANDON AND IDLE WELLS STATEWIDE LIKE HOW MANY. HOW LARGE IT OF THE INVENTORY IS GOING TO BE LEFT WHEN THIS IS WHEN THIS IS SAID AND DONE SINISTER AND SERVE THE FOOD FOR A- UNDERSTANDS IS YES IS THIS INCLUDING. THE ANTICIPATED HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE IS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR YOU JUST SAYING THAT STATE GOVERNMENT STATE MONEY NOW ALONE BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE ON TOP OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BUT I THINK IT'S HALF I THINK IT'S TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED WELLS BUT MAYBE FINANCE IF YOU WANT TO JUST IN THE STATE OR THE ONE WITH THE ANTICIPATED WITH A GUARANTEED. FEDERAL MONEY. THIS MEANS THERE ARE. THIS WOULD BE SEVEN FROM THE FROM FUNDS AFRAID THE HIGH SIXTY FIVE MILLION. WE ANTICIPATE GETTING EQUAL MORE IN ADDITIONAL PHASES. SO COULD BE TWO OR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AT THE END OF THE DAY FROM THE FEDERAL FUNDING BUT WE DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE THAT. HASN'T BEEN DETERMINED IN THE GUIDELINES OF APARTMENT INTERIOR. SO THIS WOULD BE A MIX OF AT LEAST A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING. TWO HUNDRED MILLION STATE FUNDING AND THEN WE HAVE OUR OUR FIVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR INDUSTRY FUNDING THAT WOULD GO TOWARDS THIS. IS THE OTHER THING IS INDUSTRY FUND IS LIMITED TOWARDS. OPERATION PAID INTO THAT THESE FUNDS WOULD BE FOR NO VIBE OPERATOR WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY- COMPANY TO. THE COVERAGE REGARDLESS OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX RULE EVERYONE CURRENTLY IN OPERATIONS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR- THE ULTIMATE CLEAN UP OF THEIR WELLS. AND THEIR OPERATIONS- WE'VE GONE THROUGH AND- AND RECEIVE RECORD FUNDING. LEVELS THIS YEAR A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW BONDING. WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE SB FIVE FIVE ONE RULEMAKING. THAT'S BEGINNING THERE WILL BE INCREASING BONDING. ACROSS THE STATE- AND THEN SO THE WILL HAVE MORE RESOURCES- IN THE CASE OF AN OPERATOR DOESN'T ABANDONED. THEIR THEIR CURRENT OPERATIONS BUT THESE FUNDS ARE EXPLICITLY FOR NON. BY WALLBRIDGE OPERATE ONLY GAS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA SINCE THE NINETEEN I'M SORRY THE EIGHTEEN SIXTIES. AND MANY OF THESE WELLS ARE FROM THE NINETEEN TWENTIES NINETEEN THIRTIES. THAT ARE ARE LONG PAST. A NEW OPERATOR AND IT'S- IMPORTANT WE DEAL WITH THESE LEGACY ISSUES OR IF. THEY WOULD PREFER PROCESS. FOR THE NEXT CENTURY. SO MANY WILL BE LESS. BEHIND AMONGST THE A BIT. AND IDLE WILL THAT THE C. C. S. T. REPORT IS SET. CCS REPORT. ABOUT WITH A MATHEMATICAL S. THEY CAME TO ABOUT A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN LIABILITY THEY ESTIMATED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WELLS- WERE LIKELY OR FOR- DESERTEDWE'VE IDENTIFIED ABOUT FIFTY THREE HUNDRED WELLS LOOK AT MY NOTES HERE AT THE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND PER FOR WELL OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION WOULD. BE ABLE TO- THANK YOU DENNIS ONE THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHTY WELLS- IF WE TOOK THE FEDERAL FUNDS WE COULD LIKELY DOUBLE THAT NUMBER SO. WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS LEASES MATHEMATICALLY POTENTIALLY THERE WE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING ABOUT A MORE THAN A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. THAT THE CCSU REPORT IDENTIFIED BUT THE CCSD REPORT ALSO IDENTIFIES ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND ECONOMICALLY MARGINAL AND IDLE WELLS THAT COULD BECOME ORPHANED IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE AND WE'VE SEEN THE GAME ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT.INDUSTRY PAYS ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE MASSIVE LOOPHOLE IN OUR CODE- THAT IF YOU CHANGE OPERATORS AND DECLARE BANKRUPTCY YOU CAN INSULATE YOURSELF FROM LIABILITY FROM A MAJOR SO WITH THOSE SEVENTY THOUSAND. THAT'S JUST THAT'S WORK WE'RE GONNA JUST SORT OF LOOK TO IN THE FUTURE BUT- BUT BUT THAT'S SORT OF OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE. THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S OUTSIDE IN THE pNOT OCCURRED. LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT TO SO I HOPE YOU GUYS WILL BE ON TOP OF IT WHEN IT DOES THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY- I JUST WANT TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. LOOK THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF. RESOURCES I MEAN THERE'S- WE HAVE. REALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING INTO THE GENERAL FUND- THERE'S MONEY COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU ACTUALLY GET THE PERSONNEL AND WHAT THE PLAN IS TO ACTUALLY GO IMPLEMENT- AGAIN THESE ORPHAN WELLS WHAT HOW HOW ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT SOMEBODY WOULD. BECAUSE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FILL THE POSITIONS- THAT WHO WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN- ALLOCATED. FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT% SUPERVISOR AND TOP. YES THIS WILL BE AN EXPANSION OF OUR EXISTING STATE CONTRACTING PROGRAM THE MAJORITY THE WORK WOULD BE CONTRACTED OUT TO- DO SITE ASSESSMENTS REMOVE OLD EQUIPMENT PIPELINES- THE REWORK THAT WOULD HAPPEN- WE WILL CONTINUE THAT EFFORT- THERE'S A SERIES OF- IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OF. CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT CONTRACT TO OVERSEE THE DIFFERENT RIG OPERATORS ACROSS THE STATE- THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE ASSESSMENT OF A RIG ACCESS AND LOCATIONS THAT MEN WOULD BE OVERSEEN BY- STAFF WHO PRO HAVE FIVE SIX. MEMBER IT WOULD BE PART OF THAT WHICH BE PART WHAT IS A- THEY YEAH- ARE CON UNITS OR SO. THERE THERE WOULD BE A- YOU KNOW MEN STAFFING ON THAT BUT IT WOULD BE. SOMETHING NEW BUT WE WOULD BE OVERSEEN OF CONTRACTORS. ARE THE CONTRACTORS AVAILABLE WHICH WE'VE SEEN IN THE IN THE ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION- TRYING TO GET THE LINES CLEARED FOR- TREES THERE THAT THAT THE WORK FORCE JUST ISN'T AVAILABLE SO DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF THE WORK FORCE IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS DAUNTING A PROJECT- WE DO RECEIVED NUMEROUS BIDS EVERY TIME WE DO. THAT OUT TO BID FOR A STATE CONTRACT. A DIFFERENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ALLOCATES I BELIEVE A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DO A PILOT PROGRAM TO HELP BUILD THE APPRENTICESHIPS AND TRAINING A STATEWIDE. TO GET NEW PEOPLE INTO THE INDUSTRY- TO BE ABLE TO HELP- PLUG- WELLS- BUT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THERE BEING A CHALLENGE AS FAR AS RESOURCES ARE. ARE ARE AVAILABILITY. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN S. S. F. IS RECOMMENDED THANK EVERYBODY WHO- WAS ON THE PANEL AND MOVED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION'S WE HAVE ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SIX WHICH IS A ONE TIME. ALLOCATION OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA CULTURAL AND ARTS INSULATION IN PARKS PROGRAM. I BELIEVE WE HAVE DEPUTY DIRECTOR- MISTER SHOP OUR DIRECTOR DIRECTOR SHOP SMALL FROM THE PARKS. APARTMENT THAT'S CORRECT GOOD MORNING THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS MY NAME IS WILL SHOPS MAYA I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FOR STATE PARKS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR PROPOSAL FOR A CULTURAL AND ART INSTALLATION PROGRAM. STATE PARKS IS REQUESTING A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OF FIFTY MILLION OR CULTURAL AND ARTS INSTALLATION PROGRAM. TO ENHANCE INTERPRETIVE EFFORTS IN STATE AND LOCAL PARKS. STATE PARKS WILL PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIAARTS COUNCIL AND NONPROFITS. TO DEVELOP ART INSTALLATIONS ARE PROGRAMS AND PARKS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THIS PROPOSAL WILL COMPLEMENT OUR COUNCIL'S CULTURAL DISTRICTS PROGRAM AND TO CREATE A POOR PROGRAM. UGGAMS ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY AT THE ARTS COUNCIL AND WILL HELP INFORM AND GUIDE OUR PROPOSED ARTS PROGRAM. AS YOU JENNA NOTES MANY OF OUR VISITORS CENTERS WERE BUILT IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND MANY CURRENT EXHIBITS WERE CREATED DURING THAT PERIOD. SOME EXHIBITS PORTRAY EUROCENTRIC VIEW OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND FAILED TO INCLUDE. MULTIPLE VIEWPOINTS AND STORIES WHICH IS CONVEYED THROUGH THE STATIC ARTWORK DIORAMAS AND CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS EXHIBITED. THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFRESH REINVENTION AND REENERGIZE PARKS INTERPRETATION EDUCATION AND CULTURAL RESOURCE PROGRAMS. THIS PROPOSAL FURTHER STATE PARKS OUTDOORS FOR ALL INITIATIVE WHICH FOCUSES EFFORTS TO MEET TO CREATE MEANINGFUL MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS AND GREATER RELEVANCY TO ALL PEOPLE THROUGH CALIFORNIA PARKS AND THE PROGRAMS. THIS AUGMENTATION WON BEST IN PROGRAMMING OFFERED AT OUR STATE AND LOCAL PARK THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH. TO IMPROVE PUBLIC CAN BE ENGAGED FAMILY CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND CULTURAL HERITAGE. PROVIDING A MORE INCLUSIVE NARRATIVES CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE RECRUITMENT OF ARTISTS AND REQUISITION PART THAT MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL HERITAGE. WE WERE GROUP PARTNERSHIPS WITH LEADING ARTISTS WRITERS HISTORIANS AND SCIENTISTS TO JOIN OUR EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE. STATE PARKS HAS BEEN WORKING TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PARTNERS INCLUDING TRIBAL NATIONS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THE INHERENTLY VALUABLE CULTURAL AND HISTORIC HERITAGE. AND RESOURCES ARE A CORE FUNCTION OF OUR MISSION. THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES TONES UNDERSTAND NEEDS AND GAPS AND CULTURAL INTERPRETATION IN THE COMMUNITY THE SPLIT BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL PROJECTS. WILL COME FROM THAT ENGAGEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF NEEDS AN OPPORTUNITY STATE WHAT. STATE PARKS PROJECTS SELECTION PROCESS WE USE A SCORING CRITERIA DEVELOPED FOR THE PROGRAM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. THE PROJECT SELECTION TEAM THAT CONSISTS OF STATE PARKS LEADERSHIP ACROSS FOUR PROGRAM AREAS. WILL REVIEW PROPOSED PROJECTS FOR STATE PARKS. LOCAL PARKS WHETHER CITY COUNTY OR REGIONAL PARKS WILL PARTICIPATE IN A GRANT SELECTION PROCESS THAT WILL BUILD OFF THAT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. I KNOW SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE STATE PARKS TO SUCCESSFULLY DELIVER GRANT FUNDING TO COMMUNITY IS DEMONSTRATING THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF NEED. INDICATED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY PLACES INDEX AND IT'S STATEWIDE COMPREHENSIVE OUTDOORS RECREATION PLAN TOOL. THIS ADDRESSES UNMET NEED FOR LOCAL PARKS. STATE PARKS HOUSE UNDERTAKEN THIS WORK IN THE PAST INCLUDING THE RECENT OPENING OF A NEW PUBLIC GATHERING AREA AT OLD TOWN SAN DIEGO STATE HISTORIC PARK. STATE PARKS WORKED WITH THE TO ME I NATION BUILDERS AND ARTISTS DEVELOP EXHIBITS AND ART INSTALLATIONS WHICH ARE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SAN DIEGO RIVER AND OLD TOWN SUIT- SAN DIEGO. LOS ANGELES STATE HISTORIC PARK THE PUBLIC ART AND MONUMENTS PROGRAM CONTAINS ARTWORKS THAT LIVE IN THE PARK YEAR ROUND TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC WITH THE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF LOS ANGELES. AND THE HISTORY OF THE PARK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST BOTH MYSELF AND CULTURAL RESOURCES DIVISION MANAGER DR LESLIE HARTZELL. ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF COMMITTEE. WELL LET'S TURN TO A MISS KRISTEN WHAT THE L. A. L. T. YOU HAVE. A RESPONSE TO THIS INNOVATIVE PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH I GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS HELEN CRISTINA THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT IT IS TIME PARKS HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED A LOT OF THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE ADMINISTERED- SO FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING THAT WE THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO NOW ARE. THE SPECIFIC SHARE OF FUNDING THAT WOULD GO TO STATE VERSUS LOCAL PARK- THE TYPES THE MIX AND TYPES OF INSTALLATIONS THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED FOR EXAMPLE HOW MUCH WOULD GO TOWARDS REFRESHING THOSE EXHIBITS THAT MAYBE ARE OUTDATED MAYBE DO NEED SOME REFRESHING VERSUS THINGS LIKE SCULPTURES OR EVEN TEMPORARY- TYPES OF INSTALLATIONS OR OTHER WORK WHICH MAY. ALSO BE ENVISIONED AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL. I'M IT WE ALSO HE WOULD BE HOW. AS THAT LET'S JUST HAVE A SAY. OF REALLY WOULD ACT BENEFIT FROM AS WE KNOW THE NUMBER INSTALLATION ARE PLENTY BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT NUMBER PARKS WOULD BENEFIT SO WE THINK ARE THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT HE REALLY HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND WE KNOW THAT THAT DEPARTMENT HAS MENTIONED THAT IT PLANS TO GO THROUGH SOME KIND OF A PROCESS INCLUDING STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. TO IDENTIFY THESE TYPES OF DETAILS HOWEVER IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY FULLY EVALUATE WHETHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IT'S PREFERRED LEVEL OF FUNDING OR WHETHER IT WOULD PICK PER FOR A SMALLER OR AND GREATER AMOUNT MA'AM BUT THAT'S MINUTES TO MORE DETAIL ON REALLY WHAT'S IN VISION I'M SO WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE OF REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE DETAILS SUCH AS THESE BUDGET HEARINGS- SO THEY CAN BETTER ASSESS WHETHER THIS IS- REALLY IT'S PREFERRED LEVEL OF FUNDING OR WHETHER. AND IT WOULD LIKE TO EDIT TO CHANGE THE WHOLE FUNDING TO ON ITS OTHER THIS BOX. FINANCING SAY I AGREE WITH A- MISCONDUCT. ON THE VALUE OF JUSTICE A LOT FROM. DO YOU HAVE YES GOOD MORNING MIKE MCGINNIS WITH PART OF- CERTAIN CERTAINLY- UNDERSTAND THE L. A. L. SAT QUESTIONS AT COMMON HERE- THE MINISTRY FRAME PURPOSE SOMEWHAT AS DIFFERENTLY THAN S. B. L. A. AS RATHER THAN LOOK FOR A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF PROJECTS HAVING AT HARD. PIPER PROJECT AT THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A COMMITMENT THE ADMIN. AND AMOUNT OF FIFTY NINE DOLLARS ADVANCE ART IN. AND TO BASICALLY MATCH WHAT BENEFIT CAN'T OF THAT FOR MILLION DOLLARS. ALL THE D. THEY KEPT THE US- I SEE NO MEMBERS HERE ARE. WE'RE GONNA ONCE MORE INFORMATION ON THIS WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE MATTER OPENED- AND I'LL MOVE THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND MOVED TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SIX WHICH IS A- FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL'S SERVICING SECTOR LUCKY NUMBER TODAY. IN GENERAL FUND- L. FOR STATE PARK FUTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. YEAH THANK YOU. GO AHEAD WE HAVE A ON THAT GOOD MORNING YEAH MY NAME IS BRIAN DO WE- THE CHIEF OF POLICE INVOLVEMENT AND I'LL BE A PERCENT IN THE NEXT TWO ITEMS FOR CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. THE FIRST ITEM IS FOR THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDING ONE TIME TRANSFER OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS. GENERAL FUND FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS TO. VISITOR EXPERIENCES. BILL STATE PARK RESOURCES AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. FOSTER BETTER CONNECTIONS WITH UNDER RESOURCE COMMITTEES ADDRESS BARRIERS. TO PARK ACCESS THIS AMOUNT WILL ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS ITS HIGHEST PRIORITY NEEDS. AT A LEVEL THAT REFLECTS THE MINISTRATIONS. OF THE RELATIVE PRIORITIES. BURKE SAYS CURRENTLY VALUE ITS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. AND WILL UTILIZE THE FUNDS PROJECTS PROCESS IDENTIFY PROJECTS THAT YIELD THE GREATEST BENEFIT AND BEST ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THIS FUNDING. ONCE SELECTED DETAILED SCOPING COST ESTIMATES WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. BECAUSE TO MAINTAIN THESE FUTURE PROJECTS WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED AS EACH PROJECT IS CONSIDERED FOR FUNDING THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL MAINTENANCE FUNDING. WILL BE REQUESTED IF NEEDED. I CAN PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF POTENTIAL PROJECTS AT THIS TIME. WHICH WILL INCLUDE- BORDER FIELD STATE PARK IMPROVEMENTS TO FRIENDSHIP PARK. THE GRASS STATE BEACH RELOCATE CAMPGROUND- ALLOWS WITH STATE PARK PARK IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE VISITOR EXPERIENCE CANDLESTICK POINT STATE RECREATION AREA COR IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE INITIAL BUILD OUT OF THE PARK. LAKE PERRIS STATE RECREATION AREA PARK IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE VISITOR EXPERIENCES STRICKLER THESE ARE- EXAMPLES OF POTENTIAL PROJECTS- AND THE ACTUAL LIST OF COULD LOOK- MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THIS BUT THESE ARE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT FUNDING. WELL SAY PARKS RECOGNIZES THAT IS STILL HAS A SUBSTANTIAL BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGH PRIORITY TO FOR BEING THIS PROJECT AND ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT IT HAS SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL OUTLAY NEEDS TO INVEST AT TO IMPROVE VISITOR EXPERIENCES AND EXPAND ACCESS TO PARKS. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT CAPPELLI PROJECTS CAN OFTEN. ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. SO THAT- CONCLUDE MY CALL ON THIS FOR ITEM IN THE BILL FOR TO AN ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY. YEAH CHRISTIAN WITH THE A. O. I THIS IS A CRISIS YEARS THE BY CHAIR IN NOR. WE HAVE A SPUR SPECIFIC CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE SO I'D BE INTERESTED IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF THIS. SORT OF CATCH ALL OF THE REQUEST. THANK YOU MISTER TERRY YEAH WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS KIND OF AN UNUSUAL- PROCESS I'M AWARE OF I THINK WITH THE STATE INTENDS. AND SIMILAR THINGS WE DID SOMETHING SIMILAR I THINK WITH THAT STICK PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE FIND ON THAT WITH A LITTLE BIT I CAN'T DO THIS BUT- IT IS IT IS- MORE USUAL IT'S- MERE MAYBE YOU COULD THINK ABOUT IT SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH FINES RIGHT YOU SORT OF PUT ASIDE OF THE SORT OF. THING AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT BORROWING THIS IS SETTING ASIDE THE GENERAL PLAN BUT IT'S- KIND OF DESIGNATE AN AMOUNT AND THEN- W. AT LEAST IN THIS CASE WILL BE FUTURE CORPORATION I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS- WE WEREN'T AS- CONCERNED ABOUT ANY OF THE LEGISLATURE STILL IS GOING TO HAVE THAT CHOICE- IN FUTURE BUDGETS. TO ALLOCATE- THE FUNDS TO PROJECTS IT CONSIDERS HIGH PRIORITIES BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE TRADEOFFS- BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FUNDS TO THIS PURPOSE THIS YEAR MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES SO- NO I DON'T THINK IT'S PERHAPS- AB AN UNUSUAL THING BUT- WE DIDN'T IDENTIFIES MAY BE THE MOST POPULAR SENATOR AND- THE CITY CALIFORNIA AND WHEN ALL MY COLLEAGUES ARE COMING AND SAYING I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A FIFTY THOUSAND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CATCH ALL I HAVE A STATE PARK DRIVE. WE'RE GOOD WE'LL. HEAR ABOUT THE DETAILS. FINALLY CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON OF THAT IS THE YOU OR THE AT THE OF THE REQUEST. HI GOOD MORNING THIS CHAIRED IS BRUCE ON THAT I KNOW WITH YOU TO OF- JUST WANT TO REALLY WHAT THE L. A. ALSO SHARED A THAT YOU KNOW THE PROJECT THAT ARE FUN FUTURE PROJECTS THAT WILL BE FUN THE THESE WILL BE REQUEST THAT ARE TO A AND PARTS OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T. BE ALONGSIDE PROCESS FOR ANY SO OF FUTURE APPROPRIATIONS FUTURIST O. B. C. I IT'S JUST REALLY IN THAT INDUSTRY THAT WE THAT THE FOR INSTANCE HALF OUT. IN THE SENSE THAT THE FOR ME CAN. K. OUTLIER LEFT TO AND PRIOR AREN'T MEANT TO IMPART. FIX BIG PARTS SOME COULD BE OUT BUILD. BUT IT'S A ON THE STATE OWNED PROPERTY SO AS THE- THAT BRIAN DO HE WAS. UP IN A FEW MOMENTS AGO. SOME THE ONE TWO. THAT WE- AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SO. PORTION OF THIS FIFTY MILLION MAY IN FACT. BE A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIKE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- SOLUTION IS THAT FAIR ENOUGH TO SAY THAT MR SURE- BRING UP OF THE STATE PARKS- IF I COULD COMMENT ON THAT OTHER TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT- LIKE A PROJECT THAT I EXTERNAL HOURS WE HAVE A VISITORS- EXPANSION PROJECTS SO IT'S GONNA BE REPLACING MAKE A MUCH LARGER VISITOR CENTER. BUT THE SAME TIME IT'S GONNA DRESS SOME SOME MAJOR ISSUES THAT WERE. IDENTIFIED AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE INCLUDING- POTABLE WATER FIRE WATER AND- MOST NOTABLY THE EXHIBITS- THE INTERPRETIVE FEATURES OF THE VISITOR CENTER THAT WILL ALSO NEED TO BE UPDATED SO THOSE WERE. THE MAIN INSIDE OF THAT FOR MANY YEARS THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED BY- PROJECT AT THE PARK. WITH GET SOME MONEY FROM ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SIX BUT I'D WANT TO MIX AND MATCH THEM SENATE MCGUIRE YOU HAVE A QUESTION ON ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR IN. CONTINUE HELLO THE LINE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REGARD TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN. DEFERRED MEET FACT IN. CONFIRMING I HAVE MY FOR RIGHT NOW PERSON FOR I JUST SAY I THINK TO STATE. FOR OF THE WORK ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH COAST- YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN YOU'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED AND SO WELL UNDERSTATEMENT SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM. SO AS WE JUST HEARD FROM THE CHAIR OF NEARLY ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AT FIVE THOUSAND PROJECTS ACROSS THE SYSTEM HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME THOUGH IS. NOT GUARANTEED LAST YEAR TO SUPPORT CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM- THAT MEANS WE SAW THE BILLION DOLLARS LEFT. SO WHAT I AM. PERPLEXED ABOUT. IS WHY WE'RE NOT INVESTING. IN ENHANCED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THIS YEAR WITH SUCH A FLUSH BUDGET. SO I'D LIKE TO IT WAS THROUGH THE PERMISSION WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR LIKE TO FIRST. GO TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND GET THEIR THINKING ON THIS. AND THEN- IF COULD HEAR FROM STATE PARKS. MISTER THROWN OFF YES GOOD MORNING THIS IS THAT MY TO GET A PART A FINANCE- D. PROJECTS THAT WILL BE FUNDED FROM THE FIFTY MILLION CHAU. AS THAT MR TRUMP HAD IT NOTED PREVIOUSLY CHARACTER. SIMILAR DIFFERENT AND THAT WILL HAPPEN ON. THE IMPROVEMENT IN RESTORATION THE PARKS. ADDITIONALLY AS HAD COULD PRODUCE NOTED THE- SIZEABLE. MADE TO. IN THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET ACT IS STILL BEING ADDRESSED BY THE OF PARKS RECREATION I HEARD I KNOW NOT AT ALL TO BE JUST AS PROPONENT BUT WHAT MY CONCERN IS. IN SUCH A FLUSH. IN KNOWING. HOW SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE NORTH COAST WE SAW- ISSUES IN REGARDS TO DRINKING WATER SUPPLY DRINKING WATER STORAGE WE STILL HAVE PROJECTS. NOT RELATED TO- TRAIL MAINTENANCE THAT HAVE. HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO BE COMPLETED FROM WINTER RAINS SIX YEARS AGO WE STILL HAVE ISSUES IN REGARDS TO ROADS BEING WASHED OUT WE SAW THE SHOES OF. FIRE WATER STORAGE TANKS NOT BEING COMPLETED- BATHROOMS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT FOR ABOUT TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS I SAY ALL THIS. IS THAT. I HEARD THAT ORIGINALLY ANSWER BUT- WHY WHY AS IN THEIR **** FOR FUN. SURE AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME I THINK IT'S- WORTH NOTING THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A AN ONGOING STRUGGLE THAT THE STATE FACES THERE ARE MANY MANY DEPARTMENTS WITH LARGE BACKLOGS AT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN AS OUT THAT INDIVIDUAL PEACE APPROACH. WE. ADDRESSES EIGHT IS NOT THAT WE- SOLVE AT A SINGLE OUT. ASIAN AT THE POINT IN TIME. THE I THINK I THINK THE SENATE. FIRST IS YOU TAKE CLEAN CARS FOR A THE GOODNESS CAN UP WITH THE YEAR PLAN OF HOW FORTY MILLION OR THREE SINCE YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO GO OUT TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO SPEND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION. EACH YEAR FOR THREE YEARS WE WANT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SOME SORT OF IT DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM BUT IT TAKES CARE OF A CHILD IT SAYS YOUR WE'RE LOOKING IN FISCAL. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND THIS IS THE THIS IS THE GAME PLAN OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT UP AND NOT PLEASE DON'T PUT WORDS INTO. WELL THAT'S CENTER REQUIRES BUT I THINK THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHICAL OR- SINCE WERE IN FINANCE THE ECONOMICAL GAL OUR BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES SO I GUESS WE'RE ASKING FINANCE THIS IS NOT A VALUABLE. OF INTEREST FOOD FOR YOU GUYS FOR THE FIRST DAY CALIFORNIA THAT THAT'S NOT THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR PARKS IS. IS A HAS A LOWER VALUE TEN THESE OTHER. SUGGESTED PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE. CERTAINLY AND I. UNDER THE- THAT THE FRAMING YOU FOR THAT PROVIDE HERE. B. IMAGE. PREFERRED TO GET TO. FOR MAINTENANCE AN ANNUAL BASIS. THAN COMMITTING FUTURE. THE AVAILABLE GENERAL THAT YOU HAVE FROM YOUR YOUR OBVIOUSLY SO. SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE AND- FOR MAINTENANCE LIST IS AVERAGING AS AS SAID PROJECTS MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE LIVE SO. JUST MAKE NEEDS BOB ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY BAD. AND SO RATHER THAN TRY TO FOR FUTURE NEED AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THE APPROACH IS TO. TAKE IT AS A ANNUAL- ON A BASIS. THROUGH THE AND I'LL IN IT RIGHT HERE. IS A LOOK. COMING OUT OF THIS. WE HAVE SEEN HOW THE VALUE STATE READ PARK- AND LOCAL. ARE TO CAL. AND THE PARKING. WITH THE STATE SYSTEM IS CRITICAL- IN RYE NOW WE HAVE SOME BASICS THAT JUST CAN'T GET MET. IN OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. IN BACKLOG FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THERE IS A B. C. P. THIS PAST YEAR- THAT WAS- IT DANCE BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I GET IT ABOUT ON GOING. BUT WHAT I AM CAN'T REALLY SURPRISED ABOUT WITH SUCH A MASSIVE BACKLOG THE LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE IT'S GOING TO COST TO TAXPAYERS IT'S JUST BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE AS WE CONTINUE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS IN THEBUDGET. THAT THIS BECOMES AN ANNUAL APPROACH AND- THAT THE SENATE. I BELIEVE TO THE LEADERSHIP OF TERRY MAKOWSKI. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT ENHANCE INVESTMENT WITHIN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM BECAUSE AGAIN THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. THIS IS GOOD FOR THE STATE PARKS SYSTEM. IT'S GREAT FOR THE VISITOR AND CANDIDLY. IT'S A WIN FOR TAXPAYERS BECAUSE THEY ARE ULTIMATELY KNOCK AT THE PAYS MUCH IF WE TACKLE SOME THESE TOUGH ISSUES. BUT I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO A MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU AGAIN MR CARE FOR THIS. NO I'M WE KNOW. STAFF KHANDESH IS THE WHOLE THE MATTER OPEN- WE ARE ENGAGED WITH THE- AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED IN ADMINISTRATION. THE WORD ON THE STREET IS THAT GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET WE'RE. TWENTY FIVE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE REVENUE SO THERE'S ADDITIONAL REVENUES IT'LL COMING IN OBVIOUSLY THAT SAY. THERE'S MANY PEOPLE WORK FOR FINANCE NOT THAT MANY WORK FOR ELLIE- SO WE'LL WE'LL TRY WE'LL DO THE BEST JOB THAT WE COULD DO GIVEN OUR LIMITED RESOURCES WE'LL GET A HOLD MATTER BOTH. OPEN PEOPLE BEFORE WE MOVE TAKE ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT WE WILL CALL THE ROLL AND ESTABLISH QUORUM. CASKEY HERE MCGUIRE HERE. NOT ONLY. STERN THERE BUT WILL PEOPLE HERE. HI QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED WE ARE FOR MEMBERS THIS MOVE ON CONTINUING WITH THE PARK DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE- LOW COST ACCOMMODATION PROPOSAL ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SIX. THE MIRROR- SIX POINT FOUR MILLION FOR PFEIFFER AND- FIVE HUNDRED OR SIX MILLION FOREIGN SILVER SPRING WELCOME BACK A DEPUTY DO WE- YOU CAN PRESENT THE- THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND ITEM. WE HAVE A LOW COST CRUCIAL MARGIE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE DESIGN PHASES OF LOW COST COAST ACCOMMODATION PROJECTS AT SILVER STRAND STATE BEACH AND PFEIFFER BIG BIRD- BY FOR BIG SUR STATE PARK. AND THIS MONEY WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO LOW COST COACHING COASTAL LODGING IT TOO HIGHLY DESIRABLE LOCATION. WELL THE INITIAL COST OF DEVELOPING THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES CAN BE RELATIVELY HIGH BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO ALSO INSTALL SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE. AS NOTED IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS. WILL COST CRUCIAL CURRENT. LODGING IS IN HIGH DEMAND AND AS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS WILL COME FROM FEES COLLECTED BY THE COASTAL COMMISSION DEDICATED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT BOND FUNDS. TYPICALLY SET ASIDE FOR LOW COST CRUCIAL ACCOMMODATIONS. I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE- THE FUNDING- FIVE FOR SUR WILL- NEARLY MILLION DOLLARS FOR. VISITOR SERVING FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT- LINKS- USUALLY TO THE- NEXT OF THE CABINS BEING DEVELOPED. AND WILL BE INCLUDED- RESTROOM COMBO BUILDINGS AND INTERPRETIVE- FEATURES OF THE PARK SO THAT'LL OPEN NEXT QUESTIONS. I HAVEN'T MISSED KIRSTEN THE LOW COST IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO COME PAY WHAT IT TO. THE BILL THAT THE OF SERVER CLEAR ON ON THE IT I THANK YOU FOR. WE HAVE AN IDENTITY CONCERNS WITH HIS PROPOSED AS A YOU KNOW THAT- CERTAINLY- THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL COST TO DEVELOPING THESE COMEDY SPECIFIC CADA DOWN COULD BEYOND THE- OKAY SO FROM. TO FIND IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT ADD. THIS IS DEPARTMENT FINANCE THE LIMIT OUT BUT NO PHONE PRESENTE ON THESE MATTERS WERE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THE- MY QUESTION IS THAT LET'S THAT'S- TRUMP IN AT FIVE FOR. THE AND WE'RE GONNA THESE FIFTEEN COST ULTRA LAW. AND HAS BIG UP FRONT FOR. INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT'S THE- FOR. ALL THAT'S- ONCE. ALL THE INTEREST GETS DONE YOU YOU PUT IN FIFTEEN UNITS IS THAT IT WURSTER POTENTIAL FOR. OTHERS AT A LATER DATE. AT THE END AT A LOW COST NO JUST KIDDING. I'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE ONE FOR STATE PARK- SO THAT THE IS PROVIDE UP TO FIFTEEN. AND- WE YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE- THE SITE CONSTRAINTS TO GET ALL FIFTEEN CITED- IT'S LIKELY THAT THE NUMBER'S GOING TO BE LOWER THAN THAN FIFTEEN PROBABLY CLOSER TO TEN- IN THE END WE WERE WORKING WITH THERE ARE THERE'S FLOODPLAIN ISSUES THERE'S- NATURAL RESOURCES CULTURAL RESOURCES. AND SEWER BUILDABLE AREA IS LIMITED BY IT BY THOSE THOSE CONSTRAINTS WE ALSO NEED TO GET A CLOSE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT FOR THE PROJECT AND SO- OUR FINAL DESIGN WILL NEED TO GET APPROVAL THROUGH THE THROUGH THAT- PROGRAM AS WELL- SO WE WILL. CONSTRUCT AS AS MANY AS WE CAN AT AT THIS LOCATION BUT IT'S LIKELY THAT ADDITIONAL CABINS- AT THIS PARK OR OTHER WOULD NEED TO BE INCLUDED AT AT OTHER PARKS. SO WHAT SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WELL LET'S JUST STIPULATE THAT THEY'RE HIGHLY DESIRABLE IT'S BIG SIR OKAY- IF WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAD THE MY GENERATION WE GREW UP WE HAD A DAY TRIP WHERE WE WOULD GO TO THIS HIGHLY DESIRABLE SPOT BUT THEN WE GO BACK TO SOME OTHER SPOT. THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE MORE CAMPERS ARE MORE OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE THAT. MAY NOT BE THE ULTIMATE OF A BIG SERVER MAYBE DEPEND BETTER THE SUMMER ARE MORE LOWER. OTHER OTHER SITES THAT YOU. IN THE CHEN REGION THAT MIGHT A COMMON. THIS HIGHLY THIS. LOW TO COME A- THAT ARE RIGHT THERE ON THE FREEWAY OF BIG SUR THAT MIGHT BE. MORE ECONOMICAL I GUESS THIS. I CAN I CAN PROVIDE ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND NOT IN THAT THE NEAR VICINITY BUT- WE ARE- A PLACE TO GO OUT TO BID- LATER THIS YEAR ON A- MASSIVE SELECTION GROUND DEVELOPMENT AT FORT ORD DUNES IN IN IN MONTEREY AND- THIS WILL BE A COMBINATION. OF. OF THE TRADITIONAL- CAR CAMPING SITES TO- WALK IN A TENT CAMPING OTHERS OTHER STATES ALSO- FOR A FULL- ARE AND FOR SOME- SOME CABINS AS WELL SO KIND OF A MIX OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACCOMMODATIONS AND- THOSE CAMPING LOCATIONS WILL BE EVEN MORE AFFORDABLE- THEN THEN THEN THE CABINS AND SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING TO US YES THEY PARTS INVENTORY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW IDENTIFIED. OKAY OPPORTUNE IS A VERY PARTS- AND THESE CABINS BE- THAT AT I HAVE A BIG SUR WILL BE VERY DOES. AS LIKELY THAT THEY'LL BE THEY'LL BE BOOKS HERE TO READ OF OTHER I'D WAS I GOING NO I WAS GONNA SAY AT THE FLORIDA TYPE. ANYBODY'S OUT ONE A ONE FAMILIAR IT IS PHOTOS OR SIDE IS IT. YEAH I WOULD I WOULD NEEDED TO VERIFY THAT- FOR THE SCOPE OF THE BELIEVE THE SCOPE DOES INCLUDE SOME. OF THIS- THE MORE- THE CABIN LIKE. A CHAMPION OPPORTUNITIES AT THAT THE CAR. BECAUSE IF I MEAN OUR STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT IF YOU DID SOMEHOW SQUEEZE FIFTEEN OF THESE UNITS IN TO FIGHT FOR. THAT WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CABIN. IF IT'S DOWN TO TEN IT'S SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER CABIN HIGHLY DESIRABLE ONCE YOU'RE IN THERE YOU'RE VERY LITTLE COST THE QUESTION IS THAT CAN WE DO A HUNDRED EIGHTIES AT FORTY FOUR AND GIVE A HUNDRED MORE PEOPLE SOME OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE THAT MIGHT NOT BE. STILL ON THE TENTH PERSON ONLY KEPT TENT CAMPING WHATEVER HOWEVER IT LOOKS LIKE BUT IT WILL BE NOT IN BIG CERTAINLY WILL BE AN FOUR DOOR. ADJACENT TO THE SAME PACIFIC OCEAN IT'S ALL THERE BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE THE PACIFIC OCEAN SO. THAT'S THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD GONE.
