CREATE A HUGE PROBLEM AND ALSO

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:10.707

TRAILER BILL. AGAIN IT'S JUST

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:44.314
THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK THAT

00:54:44.381 --> 00:54:45.749
WE HAVE THOUGHT AS I KNOW THAT

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:46.816
MAKING SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:47.984
ARE MADE WHOLE THAT THERE'RE

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.252
MANY IN THERE THE FOR THE

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.655
RESOURCES CONTINUE- I GOT A

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:52.822
TEXT FROM A TEACHER THAT HAS

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.157
TWO YOUNG KIDS THAT IS GONNA BE

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:55.692
REQUIRED TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:57.527
TAKERS YOUNG KIDS WITH HER TO

00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:59.429
SCHOOL TO FACILITATE THE

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:00.897
PROCESS OF MAKING SURE THERE'S

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.565
OTHER STUDENTS ARE KATE SAFE

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:03.633
WHEN SHE DOESN'T HAVE DAY CARE

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.001
FOR HER OWN CHILDREN AND SHE

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:06.670
STILL REQUIRED TO GO. SO I

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:07.470
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:09.339
THAT WE DO HERE- WITHOUT FULL

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:10.840
VETTING AND AGAIN WE HAVE TO

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:12.709
ACT IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:13.309
BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:15.078
HAVE LONGER DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:16.046
HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON THE

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:17.747
GROUND AND OUR TEACHERS ARE

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:20.050
TAKING CARE OF AND- TAKE CARE

00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:21.518
OF THEIR OWN FAMILIES AS WELL.

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:22.819
ANOTHER THING IS THAT YOU KNOW

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:24.054
A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.889
ARE OPERATING REMOTELY AND ONE

00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:27.157
OF THE BARRIERS OF OPERATING

00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:28.324
REMOTELY AND NOT HAVING

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:29.259
STUDENTS THERE WAS THE FISCAL

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:31.094
IMPACT OF THE MISSING DAYS. BUT

00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:32.562
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:33.563
OPERATING REMOTELY IS A LOT OF

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.532
OUR MAJORITY MINORITY DISTRICTS

00:55:35.598 --> 00:55:37.167
IN A POOR COMMUNITIES EVEN IN

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:38.268
MY DISTRICT DON'T HAVE CRIME

00:55:38.334 --> 00:55:40.036
NOTEBOOKS. SO STUDENTS CAN'T

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.004
OPERATE THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.439
LAPTOP AT HOME SO HOW DID THEY

00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:45.108
PARTICIPATE WHERE DO THEY GO-

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:47.143
SO ALL I WHERE I SEE HOW- WE

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.378
ARE TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:49.813
ALMOST ALL STUDENTS. WE ARE

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.014
FAILING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:52.282
SOME STUDENTS AND I'D LIKE THAT
