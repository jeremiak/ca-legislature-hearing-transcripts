WE HAVE SIXTEEN MEASURES ON THE AGENDA TODAY PLEASE NOTE THAT ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONSENT ITEMS FOR THIS HEARING. SO WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH ITEM NUMBER ONE AB. TWENTY ONE SIXTY FIVE OH THREE FOUR OH HOLD ON I'M SO SORRY DO WE HAVE A QUORUM OKAY SECRETARY Q. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JERRY LEWIS HERE IT IS HERE FLORA. FLOOR HERE FRIEDMAN GARCIA. GARCIA HERE MATHIS MCCARTY. MURATSUCHI MATTEUCCI YOUR SEYARTO STONE STONE HERE PUT YOUR WOULD HERE. WHAT WE HAVE A QUORUM READY TO START MISTER BENNETT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY WOULD REDUCE THE COST AND PROCESSING TIME FOR NGOS SEEKING PERMITS FOR PUBLIC ACCESS OR RESTORATION PROJECTS BY ALLOWING CITIES AND COUNTIES TO WAIVER REDUCE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT FEES. IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT DENIES THE REQUEST TO WAIVE THE FEE ORGANIZATIONS COULD APPLY DIRETLY TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION WHO CAN UNDER CURRENT LAW WAIVE THEIR FEES. I WOULD LIKE TO REALLY EMPHASIZE RIGHT HERE THEY CAN ONLY DO THIS IF IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LOCAL COASTAL PLAN THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A SIGNIFICANT COSTS BUT IT CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO NGOS OUT THERE TRYING TO DO- GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL WERE OR PUBLIC ACCESS WORK- IN ADDITION- AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY FURTHERS THE NATURAL RESOURCE SECRETARIES CUTTING GREEN TAPE INITIATIVE. WHICH PROVIDES THAT RESTORATION AND STEWARDSHIP PROJECTS HAPPEN MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE COST EFFECTIVELY THAN THEY DO NOW. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY ARE A LOUISA MORRIS VIA THE PHONE AND SHAUN DRAKE WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION WHO WAS HERE IN THE AUDIENCE. THANK YOU- OPERATOR Q. PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE FOR OUR- WITNESS IN SUPPORT. OTHER WITNESSES LINES ARE OPEN. AS MISS MORRIS ON THE LINE. BUT MISSED MORE SIGNATURE NOT ON MUTE. I APOLOGIZE FOR NEW WITH FINE ART GOOD AFTERNOON CARE REVISED IN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LISA MORRIS. AND I'VE WORKED ON PLANNING PERMITTING CONSTRUCTING AND MANAGING PUBLIC ACCESS PROJECT IN THE COASTAL TOWN FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS THROUGH MY PREVIOUS EMPLOYMENT WITH THE MEDICINE A LAND TRUST AND MENDOCINO COUNTY PLANNING AND BUILDING. THANKS TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION MENDOCINO COUNTY HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST AFTER L. A. COUNTY. DEDICATED COASTAL PUBLIC ACCESS IN THE STATE AND I'M PERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY OF ALL OF THE COASTAL TRAILS IN MENDOCINO COUNTY. I'M IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY BECAUSE IT WILL HELP GET MORE PUBLIC ACCESS PROJECTS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA COAST. FASTER AT A LOWER COST NON PROFITS AND WITH NO DOWNSIDE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WORKING FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT EXISTS SOLELY TO PROVIDE PUBLIC BENEFITS I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE THAT WE HAVE TO PAY THE CITY OR THE COUNTY TO PROVIDE A SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE. OF THE CITY OR THE COUNTY.BUT WHEN I WORKED AS A COUNTY EMPLOYEE I REALIZE THAT BECAUSE- ORTEZ IS PLANNING STAFF NEED TOBE PAID FOR THEIR TIME THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED A FULL COST RECOVERY FROM PERMIT APLICANTS. BUT SADLY BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE IS FULLY-SUPPORTIVE OF PUBLIC ACCESS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD LOCALLY APPROVED PROJECTS CAN GET APPEAL TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION ANYWAY CAUSING COSTLY DELAYS TO THESE PUBLIC BENEFIT PROJECT. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY WOULD ENABLE APPLICANTS WHO DON'T GET A PRICE BREAK AT THE LOCAL LEVELTO APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION. WHICH TYPICALLY HAS LOWER PERMIT FEES THAT MOST CITIES AND COUNTIES. ASIAN COULD ALSO WAIVE OR REDUCE PERMIT FEES THAT THIS CAN CUT A YEAR OR MORE OFF THE PERMITTING TIMELINE AND THE COMMISSION WOULD STILL FOLLOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL COASTAL PLAN. FIRST NONPROFIT SAVE TIME AND MONEY LOCAL GOVERNMENT STAFFER FREED UP TO WORK ON OTHER PRIORITY PROJECTS LOCAL POLICIES ARE FOLLOWED AND THE PUBLIC GETS THE BENEFIT OF COASTAL ACCESS SOONER THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD. AND THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS. SO THAT TO ME SEEMS LIKE A WIN WIN WIN AND WIN. THANK YOU FOR. LISTENING TO MY COMMENTS AND I HOPE YOU'LL VOTE YES. BY ONE EIGHTY TWENTY AND SIXTY. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR RIVAS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M SEAN DRAKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION THE COMMISSION'S CHAIR AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HAVE AUTHORIZED TO SUPPORT POSITION ON THIS BILL. PROVIDING COASTAL ACCESS AND RESTORING HABITAT ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL GOALS OF THE COASTAL ACT APPLICANTS FOR SUCH PROJECTS ARE TYPICALLY NONPROFIT GROUPS OR PUBLIC AGENCIES. AND THE FEVER COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT IS ANOTHER COST TO IMPLEMENT THESE PUBLIC BENEFIT PROJECTS. EVEN A NOMINAL FEE YOU CAN BE A BARRIER FOR SMALL NONPROFITS RELY EXTENSIVELY ON FUNDRAISING AND GRANTS. BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DOES NOT CHARGE PERMIT FEES TO PUBLIC AGENCIES AND ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO WAIVE OR REDUCE PERMIT FEES TO NONPROFITS PROPOSING COASTAL COASTAL ACCESS OR HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS. HOWEVER THERE IS NO SIMILAR AUTHORIZATION FOR COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMITS ISSUED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH IS THE MAJORITY PERMITS. WHILE SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONSIDER SUCH REQUESTS IT IS NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL JURISDICTIONS. SO THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONSIDER WAIVING OR REDUCING THE PERMIT FEE FOR A COASTAL ACCESS OR HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECT PROPOSED BY PUBLIC AGENCY OR NONPROFIT. IT WOULD NOT LIMIT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CURRENT DISCRETION RATHER IT WOULD EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONSIDER FEE WAIVER REQUESTS FOR THESE TYPES OF PUBLIC BENEFIT PROJECTS.SHOULD A LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECLINED A REQUEST THE BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THE APPLICANT TO APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION. IN THESE CASES THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM WHICH CONTAINS ITS LOCALLY ADOPTED COASTAL LAND USE POLICIES WOULD REMAIN THE STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR THE PERMANENT. IN CLOSING. BECAUSE COASTAL ACCESS AND HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS PROVIDE PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT ARE IN LINE WITH STATE PRIORITIES. IT IS GOOD POLICY FOR THE STATE TO INCENTIVIZE THEM BY ENCOURAGING COST SAVINGS WHERE FEASIBLE. THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROVIDE GREATER CONTINUITY BETWEEN HOW THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROCESS COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMITS FOR PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT THE PUBLIC. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN IPHONE. THANK YOU- WE DON'T HAVE- ANY WITNESSES REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION SO WILL NOW OPEN IT UP FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

JERRY THIS I FOR THE FLOOR NO FRIEDMAN. GARCIA GARCIA AYE MATHIS. MATHIS NO MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE MARTUCCI AYE MATTEUCCI AYE SEYARTO STONE RIGHT STONE I WOULD. WOOD I. OKAY THAT BILL HAS SIX BOATS BUT WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ADD ONS I'M NEXT ITEM TWO ALSO BY BENNETT- AB. TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TWO. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS NOTED- IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE- COMMITTEE STAFF WORK ON THIS BILL THE WINDOW IS CLOSING ON THE TIME WE HAVE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE SO THERE IS NEW URGENCY TO ENSURE WE'RE ON TARGET TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. WE CAN ONLY DO THAT IF WE HAVE REGULAR UPDATES TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN TO REDUCE TOXIC GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THIS BILL IS AIMED AT PROVIDING THIS CRUCIAL INFORMATION FROM THE APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX A LEGISLATURE PASSED A GROUNDBREAKING CLIMATE CHANGE ACT AB THIRTY TWO AS PART OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT BILL CARB UNDERTAKES A SCOPING PLAN EVERY FIVE YEARS TO IDENTIFY HOW THE STATE CAN REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND MOVE TOWARDS MEETING OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN CARBERY LEAST THE LATEST PLAN. HOWEVER EXCEPT IN A NUMBER OF STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS DEPARTMENTS AGENCIES DO NOT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING HOW THEY SHOULD IMPROVE AT. OR IF THEY HAVE ENCOUNTERED ANY IMPEDIMENTS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION. WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME INFORMATION ON THEIR IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS ON THEIR WEBSITE. THE INFORMATION IS OFTEN NOT DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE SCOPING PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS. NOR IS THE FULFILLMENT STATUS. AS CARP CONCLUDES THE NEXT COPING PLAN LATER THIS YEAR WE SHOULD HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE. TO TRACK APPROPRIATELY THE OUTCOMES AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TWO WILL REQUIRE PUBLIC POSTING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. POSTINGS WOULD BE AN AGENCY BE ON THE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS WEBSITES STANDARDIZED IN FORMAT. AND THEREFORE MORE COST EFFECTIVE. ANNUAL REPORTING ON THEIR WEBSITE SHOULD INCREASE THE FOCUS OF EACH DEPARTMENT AND AGENCY ON THE SUGGESTED ACTIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE SCOPING PLAN. IT ALSO PROVIDES VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR LEGISLATORS AS WE ANNUALLY LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE AND HOW MUCH PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING AND WHAT ARE THE IMPEDIMENTS TO MOVING FORWARD. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE- NICOLE KURIAN FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND DANIEL GROUP GUSEN CAMP OF CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR BIODIVERSITY HERE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU I'M FIRST WITNESS. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS THE STATE'S LANDMARK CLIMATE LAW AB THIRTY TWO IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATIONS ADOPTED DIRECTLY BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD SUCH AS THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM AND THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD HOWEVER SINCE ITS PASSAGE AB THIRTY TWO HAS ALSO RELIED ON OTHER AGENCIES TO TARGET REDUCTIONS GOING BEYOND LOOKING AT TAILPIPES AND SMOKESTACKS TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO TACKLE GHG EMISSIONS ACROSS. OTHER SECTORS RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING UNDER CAL RECYCLE HAVE BEEN CENTRAL TO THE STATE'S CLIMATE STRATEGY BECAUSE THEY ARE AMONG THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAYS. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. AMONG OTHER RELEVANT STRATEGIES AT THE SCOPING PLAN CHARGE CAL RECYCLE WITH AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS TO INCREASE COMMERCIAL RECYCLING DECREASE TO DISPOSE OF ORGANIC WASTE AND TO REDUCE LANDFILL EMISSIONS. CDFA WAS SIMILARLY TASKED WITH SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY SOILS AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION ON NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. DESPITE THE ORIGINAL FOCUS ON CROSS AGENCY COOPERATION IS BEEN DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STRATEGIES IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. MOST AGENCIES DON'T REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE IMPLEMENTING HOW THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED OR IF THEY HAVE ENCOUNTERED ANY IMPEDIMENTS TO IMPLEMENTATION AND WHEN THEY DO THIS INFORMATION AND THE STATUS OF THIS IMPLEMENTATION ISN'T USUALLY DIRECTLY LINKED TO THEIR SCOPING PLAN. RECOMMENDATIONS THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE ISSUE BY CREATING A SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL STATE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING PARTS OF THE SCOPING PLAN WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL TO MAKING SURE WE ACTUALLY MEET OUR TARGETS. AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO RECTIFY ANY DEFICIENCIES. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. SO WE'RE READY FOR OUR NEXT WITNESS THAT I BELIEVE IS ON THE PHONE. LINES OPERATOR. YOU PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR OUR WITNESS FOR AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TWO. HELLO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT AND CO AUTHORS FOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. MY NAME IS DANIEL POLICING CAMPAIGN DETECTED OF DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR THE UNIVERSITY C. ID IS A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT THAT FOR THREE DECADES HAS LISTENED TO SCIENTISTS AND TRANSLATED SCIENCE SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND AND SAVE THIS GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT THAT WE CALL HOME. AS YOU WELL KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE POSES AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT FOR HUMAN COMMUNITIES AND FOR THE BIO DIVERSITY THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA SO SPECIAL. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING UNACCEPTABLE IMPACT ELEVATED HEAT IS KILLING CALIFORNIANS IN DECEMBER AND A DEVASTATING NATURAL COMMUNITIES INCIDENTS LIKE SLAPPED SUMMER'S HEATWAVE IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THEY KILLED A BILLION TIDE POOL. ANIMALS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON. THIS PLANNING AN MP TOLD TAKING A CLIMATE. AND AB FIVE TWO AND THAT'S APPROACH FROM THAT PLAN. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE WERE THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOW BEEN DONE BEFORE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO FULLY TODAY EVERY SECTOR OF OUR SOCIETY. IN A TERRIBLY SHORT TIME LINE. TO SCIENTISTS THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS A FANTASTICALLY COMPLICATED MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR EXPERIMENT IT'S A NESTED SET OF HYPOTHESES FOR HOW THE WORLD WORKS AND THEN FOR ACTIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE TO TEST. HOW CARBON BUDGETS WILL RESPOND. NO SENATORS WHATEVER SET UP EVEN A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT WITHOUT FIRST DOCUMENTING ACTIONS WILL TAKE AND THE OUTCOMES TO BE MEASURED. THAT'S WHAT AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TWO DOES IT REQUIRES PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE A LIST OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. AND THEN CHECK IN ON IT. TO SEE WHETHER THEY DID IT. THIS WILL IMPROVE OUR F. TO SERVE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ONLY. IMPROVED OVER BY THE- ALSO HOPING THAT IT COULD EVEN IMPROVE CAPACITY FOR ACCOUNTABILITY MORE BROADLY ACROSS GOVERNMENT. IF AGENCIES ARE SUPPORTED IN DEVELOPING SEMI AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR TRACKING RESPONSIBILITIES AND OUTCOMES. OTHER THAN JUST DEPENDING ON UNDERPAID STATE SCIENTISTS TO KIND OF CARRY IT ALL ON THEIR OVERLOADED TO DO LISTS. THE INSTITUTE FOR BIODIVERSITY SUPPORTS AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TWO. BECAUSE IT BRINGS MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFORTS UNDER WAY TODAY. THANK YOU JERRY INVESTING COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR MOVING THIS IMPORTANT BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WERE READY FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. WE'LL START WITH THE HEARING ROOM. C. NINE OPERATOR HUGH PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB. TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TWO.

GARCIA I MATHIS MATHIS AYE MCCARTY AYE MCCARTY AYE MURATSUCHI AYE MURATSUCHI AYE SEYARTO STONE STONE I WOULD. WOOD I. THE BILL HAS EIGHT VOTES IT'S OUT AND LEAVE IT. I WILL LEAVE IT OPEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. K. NEXT ITEM THREE AB. TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BOERNER HORVATH. SORRY ARE WE DOING TWENTY FIVE NINETY THREE OR. TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SEVEN TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN RIGHT TO. THE ITEM THREE. THE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN WOULD DIRECT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO COMPLETE A COMPLETE. AND CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE COST ANALYSIS OF A VOLUNTARY STATE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASE BUYOUT STRATEGY. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS OPERATORS TO PRODUCE OIL AND GAS PURSUANT TO THE STATE LEAST INDEFINITELY AS LONG AS IT'S ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE FOR THEM TO DO SO. THE DECISION TO DECOMMISSION OR CONTINUE OPERATION RESIDES WITH THE OIL AND GAS OPERATOR UNLESS OPERATORS DISCONTINUE PRODUCTION ON THEIR OWN OR DEFAULT ON THEIR LEASE THE STATE WE NEED TO. BUY OUT THE OPERATOR'S INTEREST IN THESE LEASES IN ORDER TO DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS AND BEGIN THE DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS AND TO AVOID SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT LEGAL COSTS AND UNCERTAINTIES. CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS A GLOBAL LEADER IN CLIMATE PROTECTION AND CHAMPION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY NECESSITATES THE NEED TO END OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION FOR THE TRANSITION IN THE STATE TOWARDS A 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY. THIS TRANSITION MUST BE CALCULATED AND THOUGHTFUL USING DATA TO GUIDE THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE THE COMMISSION TO ANALYZE THE REPORT ON THE ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT IF THE STATE INITIATED A VOLUNTARY BUYOUT OF THE REMAINING ELEVEN OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES IN STATE WATERS. THIS COST IT WILL PROVIDE THE DATA NECESSARY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND ENACT PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO AN OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW AND LAST WEEK ACTUALLY AND OIL AND GAS OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA ON STATE LANDS WHEN WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE THE OIL SPILLS THAT AFFECTED ORANGE COUNTY AND MY DISTRICT THIS LAST FALL. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOTH VOTE AND STAY WITH ME I HAVE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. CRISTINA CONDON KUNKEL DEPUTY COMPTROLLER FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND SHERI PEMBERTON CHIEF EXEC EXTERNAL AFFAIRS LEGISLATIVE. LIAISON AT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRISTINA CONGAL DEPUTY COMPTROLLER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY ON AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN. AN IMPORTANT BILL THE CONTROLLER IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR. AS CALIFORNIA'S CHIEF FISCAL OFFICER AND CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION. CONTROLLER HE UNDERSTANDS THE NEED FOR A CAREFUL COMPREHENSIVE AND FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO ENDING OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS. ENDING OFFER GAL GADOT LIVE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION. FACES CHALLENGES THAT ARE DEEPLY ROOTED IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORICAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. EXISTING LAW AND THE LEASES THEMSELVES CONTAIN LANGUAGE THAT ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS OPERATORS TO OPERATE INDEFINITELY. THE FIRST OFFSHORE OIL WELL WAS DRILLED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT WE HAVE BEEN EXTRACTING OIL AND GAS OFF SHORE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. WE CANNOT SIMPLY PULL THE PLUG OVERNIGHT WITHOUT COMMITTING THE STATE TO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL COSTS AND UNCERTAINTIES. AN INVOLUNTARY TOP TERMINATION WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY EXTENDS THE LIFETIME OF THESE LEASES WELL OPERATORS DEFENDS THEIR BINDING CONTRACTS IN COURT. AND WHILE LEGAL COSTS TO TAXPAYERS ACCUMULATE. THIS IS WHY WE NEED AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN. WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE STATE WITH CONCRETE AND CRITICAL DATA TO EVALUATE AND NEGOTIATE A VOLUNTARY BUYOUT STRATEGY. THE COMPLETE FISCAL IMPACT OF ENDING OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND IRRESPONSIBLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE COSTS THIS COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS WILL DELIVER THE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR POLICY MAKERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND ACT PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN IS A CRUCIAL INVESTMENT TOWARD OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY TRANSACTION. THE CONTROLLER RESPECTFULLY URGES YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH AN AYE VOTE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AND GUIDE THE STATE ON THE PATHWAY TO A FOSSIL FREE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SHERI PEMBERTON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO GATHER THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION NECESSARY. FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED WITH ENDING OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OF THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK AND THE TERMS OF THE EXISTING LEASES WHICH ARE CONTRACTS THE STATE'S OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LESSEES HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT AN OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE PRODUCING OIL AND GAS. AS LONG AS IT IS ECONOMIC FOR THEM TO DO SO. THE COMMISSION IS AWARE OF THE RATIONALITY OF THE SITUATION GIVEN THE CLIMATE CRISIS BUT THAT IS THE LAW. AND WHILE CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY POLICIES OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND SIXTIES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR POLICIES AND VALUES TODAY. THE STATE IS BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO DECADES AGO. NO UNILATERAL OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASE TERMINATION AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT IT AGO SHE DID AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMMISSION AND THE LASSIES. THIS BILL WILL YIELD THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFUL AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD AND OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS WITHOUT INCURRING. MASSIVE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL COST DELAYS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMMISSION AS THE RIGHT ENTITY TO MANAGE THIS STUDY. IT'S EXPERIENCED WITH SECURING THE SERVICES OF RESERVOIR ENGINEERS AND ASSESSING COMPLEX OIL AND GAS RESERVOIR INTERNET INFORMATION. THE STUDY WOULD INVOLVE ARRANGING FOR A RESERVOIR ENGINEER TO DETERMINE WHAT RESERVES REMAIN AND ARE LIKELY TO BE PRODUCED. IT WILL ALSO INVOLVE ECONOMIST AN APPRAISAL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE PRICE OF OIL PRODUCTION PRODUCTION TRAJECTORY. AND THE COST OPERATORS BEAR TO PRODUCE OIL AND GAS WE WOULD USE THAT INFORMATION TO DERIVE A VALUE THAT WOULD BE THE FOUNDATION FOR NEGOTIATION TO SUCCESSFULLY AND OILAND GAS OPERATIONS. THIS IS A SMART THOUGHTFUL AND LEGALLY SOUND BILL THAT BEST POSITIONS CALIFORNIA TO. AND OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS AND OFFSHORE STATE WATERS AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AT THE- THANK YOU.

THIS BILL IS THE RESULT OF A TRANSPORTATION PROJECT THAT WE HAD IN NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO WE'RE WIDENING OF THE I. FIVE FREEWAY LANES ARE JUST A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY RESIDENTS IN REGARD TO THE IMPACT OF WILDLIFE LIVING IN THE SIX COASTAL LAGOONS THIRTY TWO ACRES OF WETLANDS AND SEVENTY FOUR ACRES OF COASTAL SAGE IT'S BEEN AN EX EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSFUL PROJECT I THINK WE MAY BE DOING IT UP AND DOWN THE COAST. AND DURING THE COURSE THE PERMITTING PROCESS THE COASTAL COMMISSION APPROVED THE PROJECT WITH IMPROVEMENTS RELATED TO ENHANCING MARINE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE HABITATS THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO MITIGATING IMPACTS TO NATURAL RESOURCES CAN BE REPLICATED TO BUILD OR RESTORE BLUE CARBON SINKS BLUE CARBON ISN'T THE MOST EFFECTIVE YET OVERLOOKED METHOD FOR LONG THE QUESTION AND STORAGE OF CARBON BLUE CARBON ECOSYSTEMS NOT ONLY PREVENT CLIMATE CHANGE THEY ALSO PROTECT COASTAL COMMUNITIES FROM THE HARMFUL IMPACTS SUCH AS RISING SEAS AND FLOODING AND PROVIDE IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR MARINE LIFE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE.

I'M EXECUTIVES OUTLINED OUR CONCERNS VERY QUICKLY- OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IN AB TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN WHICH IS VERY NARROW ND LEAVES OUT MANY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- BUT PARTICULARLY ALMOST ALL COMMUNITIES NORTH OF SACRAMENTO WOULD BE LEFT OUT OF THE DEFINITION OF THIS BILL- AS YOU KNOW USER ACCOUNT BY RICH GREEN DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WHICH- REALLY FAILED TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES THEY'RE STRUGGLING. TO MEET WATER QUALITY STANDARDS. URBAN WATER RESOURCES AND STATE WATER BOARD USE THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE DEFINITION. I WHICH IS NOT ALLOWED THEM TO DIRECT FUNDING TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE WATER QUALITY ISSUES. I'M IN ADDITION THIS BILL- WELL WHAT SEEKS TO BUILD ON PRESIDENT BIDEN'S JUSTICE FOR INITIATIVE. I'M THIS BILL WOULD MANDATE 40% OF FUNDING FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT. WELL THE FEDERAL EFFORT IS A GOAL ONLY. THE FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE STILL IDENTIFYING HOW THIS GOAL SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND TO FURTHER COMPLICATE MATTERS THEY HAVE YET ANOTHER DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. I'M SO YOU KNOW THIS BILL REALLY GET THE HEAD OF THAT FEDERAL PROCESS YOU COULD HAVE A SITUATION. WHERE IF IT MOVES FORWARD CALIFORNIA IT COULD BE DIRECTING FUNDING TO COMMUNITIES. THAT MAY NOT EVEN SATISFY THE FEDERAL GOAL. WE WOULD HOPE THAT THIS BILL WOULD BE AMENDED TO ALIGN WITH THAT FEDERAL PROCESS WHICH IS ONGOING. I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OTHER OFFICE OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL DID NOT. LEAVE OUT SO MANY STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

THE MANAGER AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE. THANK YOU- I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER WHAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH ME ABOUT YOUR GOALS FOR THIS BILL I THINK WE AGREE ON MOST OF EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. UNFORTUNATES WE TALKED- THE BILL USES THE ENVIRO SCREEN- WITH DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME. THAT'S COOL HEAVILY WEIGHTED AIR QUALITY TO IDENTIFY WHICH COMMUNITIES QUALIFY. AND THAT DISADVANTAGES THE ALREADY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT- ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS APPROPRIATE USE THAT TOOL TO DRIVE RESOURCES TO CLEAN UP EMISSIONS AND OTHER AIR QUALITY CONCERNS. THE PROGRAM YOU PROPOSE IS MUCH BROADER THAN THAT. IT EXPLICITLY BECAUSE OF RESOURCES DEDICATED TO WATER. INFRASTRUCTURE CLIMATE CHANGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND EVEN BROADBAND. I NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE EXPAND BROADBAND MY DISTRICT HAS BEEN A FOCUS OF MINE FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING REBUILD HOUSES INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER WILDFIRES WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED IN MY DISTRICT. ADDRESS C. LEVEL RISE. THREE OF THE FIVE COUNTIES I REPRESENT HAVE POVERTY RATES OVER 20% AND ONE HAS THE LOWEST PER CAPITA INCOME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS BILL FURTHER DISADVANTAGES THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE DESPERATELY PUBLIC DOLLARS TO HELP BUILD MAINTAIN AND RESTORE INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT AND ALL THEY PREDICT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. WITH THE BILL. I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. SO IN THE BILL- AS WAS MENTIONED TO YOU TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF WE HAVE ALSO CARVED OUT 10% FOR LOW INCOME SPECIFICALLY IRRESPECTIVE OF CALABAR WAS GOING. WHICH MEANS IT'S AN AREA THAT HAS THE LOWEST PER CAPITA IN THE ENTIRE STATE WOULD. MOST ASSUREDLY QUALIFY WE ALSO MAJORED REPLACE THIS IN THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL THAT THERE ARE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES TO HELP. BRING COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE KNOW LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ALSO STRUGGLE TO ACCESS THE STATE RESOURCES. AND SO WE MOVED AWAY FROM THE VIRUS GOING FOR PORTION. OF THIS ALLOCATION 10% TO MAKE SURE THAT JUST POOR COMMUNITIES OUT RIGHT. AREN'T LEFT OUT JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE POOR AIR QUALITY OR DON'T HAVE POOR WATER QUALITY OF WHATEVER METRICS DISPROPORTIONATELY WAY. CALAVERAS GOING. APPRECIATE THAT OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I WOULD ARGUE THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE DISADVANTAGED AND LIKE I SAID IN MY DISTRICT- CALAVERAS GREEN REALLY DISADVANTAGES US LIKE SO I THAT'S THAT'S THE CHALLENGE I HAVE SET UP THE PHONE AND RESPECTFULLY LOW INCOME IS ALSO ONE OF THE METRICS THAT INCLUDED IN CALAVERAS SCREEN IT'S ACCUMULATIVE SCORE. YEAH AND THE PROBLEM IS IF WE HAVE GOOD AIR QUALITY AND WE HAVE CLEAN WATER THAT MEANS WE DON'T GET ANYTHING. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THAT'S A PROBLEM ON ON PRETTY MUCH. EVERY EVERY EVERY FACET OF THAT. AND I SO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I ABSOLUTELY DO AND I DON'T DISPUTE THAT AT ALL BUT- JUST GET OVER SOMETHING THE DISADVANTAGES. ARE READY TO SERVE AS COMMUNITY. ABSOLUTELY NOT BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO FIND ADDITIONAL METRICS BESIDES LOW INCOME- IF THEM AS A BETTER. TOOL THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND- BUT THE ENVIRO GREEN AND THE COMBINATION OF LOW INCOME I THINK IT'S- THE OVERWHELMINGLY MAJORITY OF DISPROPORTIONATE COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. RULE AND URBAN- BUT I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU OF COURSE. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF MISPERCEIVED- THANK YOU SO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS SETS ASIDE A PERCENTAGE AND THERE'S STILL A LARGE PART PART OF THE PIE THE MAJORITY OF IT THAT GO ANYWHERE ACROSS THE STATE BUT OUT THERE ANYTHING SOMETIMES HERE IN THE CAPITAL WE GET INTO WHAT I CALL THE OPPRESSION OLYMPICS OF WHO HAS IT WORSE WE- A LOT OF COMMUNITIES NEED TO AT HAND UP AND A LOT OF COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE HAVE BEEN LEFT. OUT OUT THERE. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE'S A LARGE PROPORTION OF. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE CONCENTRATED WHERE WE HAVE. AIR WATER SOIL ISSUES OUT THERE AND IT'S AT THAT MUCH MORE MAGNIFIED OUT THERE. AND SO I KNOW AT TIMES THE FRUSTRATION WITH THE CALAVERAS UNIBODY DO THINK IT'S A FAIR TOOL. OUT THERE I THINK WHEN YOU START TO POINT OUT 10% FOR LOW INCOME YOU'RE TRYING TO. BE INCLUSIVE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALSO BEING LEFT BEHIND FOR OTHER REASONS- THAT MIGHT NOT INCLUDE ERR. OUR WATER BUT OTHER REASONS THAT ARE ALSO IMPORTANT SO I DO APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE- I OFTEN SAY THAT- LET'S FIGURE OUT THAT THAT PIECE BUT THEN AT THE END THE DAY I'D LIKE TO SEE MUCH MORE THAN THIS PART OF THE PIE GOING TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DEFINE THAT. BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT THEY ARE BEARING. THE MAJORITY A LOT OF IT OF THE BURDEN OUT THERE AND HAVE BEEN FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND SO- I'M HAPPY TO COOPER IS I'M HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THIS TODAY AND I THINK CONTINUES. TO MOVE AND I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO CHANGE THE PERCENTAGE I TO HIGHER BUT I DO THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAY I NEED TO POINT OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT. I THIS IS JUST A STARTING POINT IN THE FLOOR NOT THE CEILING OF WHAT THESE COMMUNITIES NEED. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY I THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING OF THIS MEASURE- I APPRECIATE YOUR DEDICATION TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- I SHARE THAT PASSION WITH YOU TO MAKING SURE THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES GET WHAT THEY DESERVE- FROM FEDERAL FUNDING ESPECIALLY- I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THE DEFINITIONS AND WHO QUALIFIES I'M INCLUDING- YOU KNOW STAYED UP TO DATE ON WHATEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- IS DECIDING ON JUSTICE FORTY WHICH I KNOW THAT. IT'S STILL IN DEVELOPMENT- SO THANK YOU AND ALSO I WANT TO ASK IF YOU WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PROPOSE I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OKAY THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ABSOLUTELY IN ADDITION TO EXT ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS I WANNA PUSH BACK ON SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID OVER THE PHONE LINES. THIS IS NOT A MANDATE THIS IS A THE GUIDELINES FROM THE COMMISSION OUR RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE OF THAT FLEXIBILITY TO BE NIMBLE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT AS WE KNOW FAR TOO OFTEN- CALIFORNIA LEADS THE COUNTRY. IN SO THERE'S NO REASON FOR US NOT TO HAVE OUR VOICE HEARD IN THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE- AND SO BY HAVING A COMMISSION THAT RECOMMENDS WHAT 40% DISADVANTAGE COMMITTEES TO LOOK LIKE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT MEASURE FOR CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION. TO MY COLLEAGUES LOS ANGELES IS POINT OF BELL GARDENS POINT. IF WE DON'T MAKE THE INVESTMENTS WITH NEW MONEY TO TRY TO REMEDY SYSTEMIC HARMS OF HISTORIC NEGLECT AND DIVESTMENT. WE'RE NOT EVEN READY TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE DO WITH EXISTING RESOURCES AND SO I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE. TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER BRYAN.

THANK YOU. MANAGER WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR MESSAGE- OKAY I'M SORRY. ME MR SAY ART. I THANK YOU SO. I LOVE THE CONCEPT OF FORESTS EVERYWHERE WHAT I DON'T LOVE IS CALIFORNIA'S PENSION FOR NOT HAVING ANY WATER IN ADDITION TO OUR ALREADY WORSENING WATER CRISIS- IT'D BE EASY TO GET BEHIND SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF WE HAD A SECURE WATER SOURCE- BUT WE REALLY DON'T AND AS SO IT'S HARD FOR ME IN THE FACE OF. A LOT OF THE OTHER IMPACTS THAT THAT ARE GOING ON FROM A WIDER PERSPECTIVE AND ALSO WHAT THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS WITH THESE POCKET. POCKET FORESTS. BE SUBJECTED TO THE SEQUEL PROCESS BECAUSE I CAN SEE A LOT OF BENEFIT IF THERE'S ENOUGH OF THEM- THAT WE CAN KEEP ALIVE. TO AIR QUALITY AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AND NOT TO MENTION SOME OF THE THINGS IS SPEAKERS OF SET- BUT- TO GET THROUGH A PROCESS THAT WILL EVALUATE THE WATER AND DRAINAGE AND RUNOFF AND THINGS LIKE THAT- SEEMS. LIKE IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WE ALLOW IN COMES TO THE ISSUE OF DROUGHT WHICH I THINK IS A REASONABLE ONE TO CONSIDER- A POCKET FOR THE THERE ARE OR THEY SHOULD WATER IN GENERAL AND DROUGHT MORE SPECIFICALLY- WHAT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS KIND OF GREENERY THAT ACTUALLY IS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE SO IT WAS MORE SUSTAINABLE BECAUSE POCKET FOR HIS UTILIZED NATIVE SPECIES ARE MORE COULD TO HANDLE CHALLENGES AND BY MITCHELL PAN INCLUDING DROUGHT EACH POCKET FORCES GROWS INTO MINIATURE SELF SUSTAINING ECOSYSTEM THAT PROTECT SELF CONTROL. THE BILL INSTRUCTS CAL PART EMPHASIZE USE THE DROUGHT RESISTANT NATIVE SPECIES AND APPROVE POCKET FOR US PROJECTS AND THE BILL GRANTS RECIPIENTS HAVE A LOT OF FUN PROJECT WITH MEANINGFUL PARTNERS FOR IMPLEMENTATION FOR AND A PLAN FOR LONG TERM MAINTENANCE OF A POCKET FOURS AND THAT IT DOES ALSO INCLUDE CONTINGENCIES FOR SEVERE DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND FINALLY I'D SAY THAT LOOK ESPECIALLY PUTTING IT OVER PAVEMENT OR SOMETHING OR JUST AND- THAT'S RUNNING OFF INTO THE INTO THE WATER STREAM AND EVENTUALLY JUST WASTING AWAY THIS ACTUALLY ABSORBS WATER IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE. A HABITAT OF THIS NATURE YOU'RE ACTUALLY KEEPING THE WATER IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY GROWING OUR WATER TABLE SO AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT SPONSOR SO TO SPEAK FOR THE WATER THAT FALLS IN THE ULTIMATELY OTHERWISE WOULD BE GOING TO STRAIGHT OUT. INTO THE SOLAR SYSTEM. MR FOR. THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU FOR SORT OF- BUT TO KILL. HERE AT. BUT IS INTEREST AS WE TALK ABOUT THE RURAL COMMUNITY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I GREW UP IN A RURAL COMMUNITY. AND WE'VE GOT GUYS THAT ARE FOLLOWING LAND- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE WATER WE'RE JUST GONNA DOWN THERE WE'RE NOT PLANTING TREES AGAIN. AND THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES WHERE. MY FOLKS GROW UP THIS IS THEIR PARK. RIGHT AND SO I THINK AS WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. WORDS LIKE AROUND HERE TO PAY PAUL WITH THIS AND I THINK A LOT OF THIS GOES AWAY IF WE ACTUALLY HAVE. A STORAGE STRUGGLE WITH THESE PROJECTS BECAUSE- NONE OF US ARE SAYING THAT. KID IN BERKELEY SHOULDN'T. HAVE TREASON AND PLAY ON GRASS LIKE I THINK THAT'S SAD THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY THE CASE. BUT I DO WANNA MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR THAT AS WE TRANSFER WATER. INTO OTHER REGIONS THAT COME FROM OUR AREA. ARE STEALING FROM THE ARSON AS WELL. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO GO AROUND. THE WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIX IT SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND FOCUS ON THAT. THEN THE OTHER THING IS- THIS IS A SECOND ON A ROAD WE'VE RECALL PUT TUNING REQUIREMENTS ON CALIFORNIA. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS WELL. CALIFORNIE EXISTE UNIQUELY FOCUSED ON SUPPRESSION AND DO WITH THEIR SUPER GOOD AT. AND SO I WOULD JUST BECOME. A LITTLE BIT CAUTIOUS ON. THE ADDITIONAL TASK WE GIVE THE CAL FIRE. BECAUSE WHEN THE STATE. ULTIMATELY IS BURNING AGAIN WE'RE GONNA NEED THEM TO BE FOCUSED ON THAT. I PROJECT THAT I COULD MADAM CHAIR OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY OPERATES A GRANT PROGRAM FOR URBAN GREENING THIS DISTANCE ADDS THIS IS ONE MORE ELEMENT THAT THEY COULD POTENTIALLY. COULD COULD QUALIFY FOR THOSE WHO EXISTING GRANTS. AND SECONDLY AGAIN- IT I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO BE I THINK YOUR POINT IS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN EITHER OR NOT AGREE WHEN IT COMES TO. A WATER- BUT THE REALITY IS IN MANY URBAN AREAS WE LOSE A LOT OF WATER TO RUN OFF FAR TOO MUCH. THAT EVENTUALLY IMPACTS THE ENTIRE STATE. BECAUSE THAT URBAN AREAS ARE TAKING MORE WATER THAN THEY NEED. THIS ACTION PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO MAINTAIN MORE WATER IN THE URBAN AREAS OF THAT. WOULD HAPPEN TO US OF THE NEED FOR THE LONG RUN IT WOULD TAKE TWO TO THREE YEARS TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT. BUT ONCE YOU GET PAST THAT IS A COMPLETELY SUSTAINABLE. THE STARSHIPS. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. WORKING ON THIS. BILL LIKE L. AND I WAS IN A PLANT THINKING THAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY RUNS AND URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM- WORK WITH THEM REGULARLY IN MY DISTRICT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT OFTENTIMES WE CANNOT ACCESS THE DOLLARS IS ALL WE HAVE LEFT OUR POCKET PARK AREAS AND PARK AND FORESTRY AREAS AND HAVING TO BE CREATIVE. IN THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX OUT THERE NOT JUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF HAVING NATURE AROUND US BUT WE KNOW THAT LIVING AMONGST THE CONCRETE THAT I LIVE IN AND DEFINES MY DISTRICT WITH SIX FREEWAYS. TO REVERSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY JUST A BUNCH OF CONCRETE THAT BOOK AND MY DISTRICT AS WELL- OUR CONCRETE IS THE REALITY IS THAT I LIVE UNDER HIVING ISAAC THIS ALSO HELPS US WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WITH A FEW ALLEN AFFECT THAT OUR CHURCH CONSTANTLY WORKING ON. AS WELL AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EITHER OR I THINK BEING ABLE TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE AND GETS US TO ARTS SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM GOALS IS WHAT THIS BILL IT IS REALLY ABOUT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE INNOVATION OF CALLING ATTENTION TO POCKET FOREST INITIATIVES- AND. I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE HAVE AND THEN A TENER. BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR. LIKE MINE- ESPECIALLY BE THINK ABOUT PAY YOU BACK THE P. BACK IN THAT WITH. BROWN FEELS IT WERE ABLE TO CLEAN UP THOSE BROWNFIELD EVER EVER TO TURN THEM INTO THESE POPULAR FOREST WERE ABLE TO THEN CAPTURE WATER WERE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT MY TABLE WATER IS HIGHER AND HAVE LESS POLLUTION- THAT I'M DEALING WITH THEIR WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT. WE DEAL WITH THIS ON SO HAVING THIS COMING TOWARD TABLE WATER. INSTEAD OF RUNNING OFF BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE COUNTRY DOESN'T JUST PUSH THAT AWAY- IS INNOVATIVE AND SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFITS. OUT THERE ON THAT- THAT'S THAT IN THE IN THIS URBAN COMMUNITIES THAT THE DROUGHT ISSUE- WOULD ACTUALLY BE BENEFITTED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND SO JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON THAT AND I LIKE TO BE A CLOTH ON YOUR ABILITY TO KEEP PLAYERS. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST CAN'T. GO UNNOTICED YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR MADE AN EMERGENCY DROUGHT OR THE OTHER WEEK AND WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T EVEN WATER YOUR LAWN- YOU KNOW MENTIONING STORM AFTER WE'VE ACTUALLY PASSED QUITE A BIT A LEGISLATION OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AIMED AT STORM WATER CAPTURE IT TO SEIZE THAT WATER SO IF YOU GET IT BACK INTO THE WATER SUPPLY- SO TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT FOR ME IS KIND OF THE HERE OR THERE BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY. MOVING CAPTURE EVERY LAST DROP WE CAN- MISTER FLORA AND MISTER SATTAR BRING UP GREAT POINTS YOU KNOW AND IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE LITERALLY- THE DROUGHT IS SO SIGNIFICANT THIS IS AFFECTING US AT A AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALSO IS WE HAVE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING TURNED DOWN BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF WATER SO IT'S NOT JUST HURTING A AGRICULTURAL FARMING STANDPOINT. WERE FOLLOWING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES WHICH ISN'T JUST URTING THE FARMER THAT'S- JOBS. THAT'S ONE IN FOUR JOBS IN IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BEING AFFECTED. OVER WATER SITUATION SO FOR US TO GO BACK HOME AND SAY HEY. YOU KNOW AND I LOVE THE IDEA OF THE PARK FORCES IT'S GREAT. BOY WHEN WE'RE IN THE THIRD YEAR- OF THE DROUGHT. WHEN WITHIN THE LAST YEAR YOU KNOW THE DROUGHT THAT WAS HAPPENING. YOU KNOW NOT EVEN TEN YEARS AGO WAS SUPPOSEDLY THE WORST DROUGHT WE'VE EVER SEEN BUT NOW WE'RE IN THE THIRD YEAR OF AN EVEN WORST DROUGHT. SHELL CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE. YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE GONNA HAVE DROUGHT PROOF. FORCED OUR PLANET BUT THEN. ARE THOSE HYBRIDS REALLY TRULY NATIVE- HOW HOW'S THIS GOING TO WORK YOU KNOW IN THE POINT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO. YES CAL FIRE HAS AN EXISTING PROGRAM. WELL WHAT IS THEIR FOCUS TRULY NEED TO BE. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT RAINS ACTION IN YOUR DISTRICT. UNOPENED INTENDED TO THE AUTHOR- IT AFFECTS PEOPLE THAT AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE. WE CAN'T REALLY GO HOME AND SAY HEY WE'RE PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE PROVIDING YOU KNOW BETTER LIFE OUTCOMES. WHEN THE FACT IS OUR PEOPLE DON'T HAVE WATER IT'S RAINING ASHES ON THEM IN THIS IS PULLING RESOURCES AWAY FROM. SO HOW CAN MY COLLEAGUES AND I EXPLAINED THAT TO OUR COMMUNITIES THEY IN THE VALLEY TO SUPPORT SOMETHING THEY THINK YOU SEVEN MEMBER THERE ARE IS AN EXISTING COPPER URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY GRANT PARK PROGRAM WHICH I WOULD ARGUE RIGHT NOW THE FACT THAT THE THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR TREE PLANTING FOR EXAMPLE LONGSTREET'S SPACED OUT TREES- IS ACTUALLY LESS- LESS PRODUCTIVE USE A WATER PARK OF COURSE ARE STAYING WITHIN TWO TO THREE YEARS AND SO THE REALITIES EVERY GALLON OF WATER WE CAN SAVE IN URBAN AREAS IS ONE MORE GALLON THAT BECAME TWENTY YEAR COMMUNITIES. RIGHT NOW SO MUCH RUN UP AS MUCH WATER IS WASTED IN URBAN AREAS POCKET FOR US HAD THE OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY CAPTURE THAT WATER AND IT IS THE END NOT ONLY THATBUT IN PLACES LIKE SAN JOSE WE ARE PURPLE PIPES WE HAVE RECYCLED WATER THAT'S NOT POTABLE BUT WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE FUNCTIONAL BUT THEIR FUNCTION FOR INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES WILL BE FUNCTIONAL FOR THIS AS WELL SO WE CAN USE RECYCLED WATER IN ORDER TO CREATE THAT FIRST TWO THREE YEARS OF STAYING ABILITY AND THEN ASSISTING ABOUT THEIR ON. GOING FORWARD AND THAT DOESN'T THE SCIENTISTS SAY THIS I'VE BEEN USING NATIVE PLANTS I BECOME SUSTAINABLE LOOK LOOK LOOK MORE INTO THE QUALITY PART PER BILLION PERCENTAGE FOR PURPLE HEART PIPE VERSUS A BOTTLE OF WATER IN THOSE NUMBERS. WILL SURPRISE YOU- BUT IT'S- A AGAIN WE- IN. SYSTEMS THE CAP. THAT WAY TO SET UP ON OFF SYSTEMS. SO YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO PLANT TREES FOR TO CAPTURE. THE SYSTEMS ARE BEING DESIGNED IT TO CAPTURE THAT WATER OUT RIGHT. SO THAT. I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN GET TO A POINT. TO VALIDATE ST. YOU KNOW DOING THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE MORE WATER. IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM. IN THIS STATE. WE NEED MORE WATER NOT JUST FOR AGRICULTURE BEFORE ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS AN INTEL WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S SUSTAINABLE. FOR OUR CURRENT POPULATION I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE THIS. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING IN THIS MEASURE- EXCITED TO SUPPORT IT TODAY LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BELL GARDENS- MENTIONED ABOUT ALL ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH HERS- MY DISTRICT IS VERY SIMILAR TO- MIGHT. TO BELL GARDENS- WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR. STRAIGHT RIGHT A TREE- IF YOU DRIVE THROUGH DISTRICTS LIKE MINE AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS VERY FEW TREES. OUT AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO INCREASE THAT TO DEVELOP. AT THE TREE CANOPY IN COMMUNITIES. THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND SO THANK YOU FOR.

SO THIS IS ITEM FOURTEEN AB TWENTY TWO NINETEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD AND START WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT TWENTY AB TWENTY TWO NINETEEN. THE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE THEIR RESOURCES BOARD IS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION. WHY THE REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAVE NOBLE INTENT. AND BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIANS MANY OF THE REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY THEIR RESEARCH RESOURCES BOARD HAVE FAR REACHING EFFECTS ON NUMEROUS BUSINESS INDUSTRIES. EXPRESSLY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE A FINANCE FINANCIAL CAPACITY OR KNOW HOW TO INFLICT THIS IS NOT JUST A FEW AFFECTED BUSINESSES. IN NINETEEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE ROUGHLY A THIRD OF ALL OF THE STATE WORK FORCES WERE IN FULL OP EMPLOYED BY A BUSINESS WITH LESS THAN FIFTY FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. AB TWENTY TWO NINETEEN WOULD REQUIRE ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON RULES TO ALSO BE A PERSON. WHO REPRESENTS A SMALL BUSINESS THAT EMPLOYS FEWER THAN FIFTY FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. THIS IS A NECESSARY STEP IN HAVING THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ACKNOWLEDGE RESPONSIBILITIES IT HAS IN THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE IN INDUSTRIES THAT IT REGULATES. FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. AND MY WITNESS TODAY WILL BE MARK CREEK FILLED WITH A GREATER HIGH DESERT CHAMBER. THANK YOU OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE FOR MISTER MARK CRANFIELD. SENATE BILL THE LINES OPEN YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIR RIVAS MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARGARET FIELD AND I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO WITH THE GREATER HIGH DESERT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. ON BEHALF OF OUR CHAMBER AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO NINETEEN. OUR CHAMBER REPRESENTS SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MEMBERS MANY OF WHICH WERE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE GREATER I GATHER. PART OF THE WORK WE DO WITH ASSISTING THESE BUSINESSES WITH UNDERSTANDING AND IMPLEMENTING COMPLIANCE THE CARD REGULATION. BECAUSE OF THIS I UNDERSTAND FIRSTHAND THE IMPACT CARDS REGULATIONS CAN HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE BEING A RULE COMMUNITY MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES COMMUTE LONG DISTANCES. VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS AND PROPOSALS LIKE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED CAN CREATE BURDENS ON THESE INDIVIDUALS. MANUFACTURING IS ANOTHER MAJOR INDUSTRY IN THE DISTRICTS SUPPORTED BY MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. REGULATIONS ON HEAVY VEHICLES AND DIESEL TRUCKS THAT LASTING IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND MAKE DOING BUSINESS MORE EXPENSIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND ACROSS THE STATE. HAVING A REPRESENTATIVE ON THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD WHO UNDERSTAND SMALL BUSINESS. CAN LEND THEIR VOICE TO CARDS REGULATORY PROCESS ENSURING THAT POLICIES PASSED BY CART. AND IF IT ALL CALIFORNIANS FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WE DON'T HAVE A WITNESS A REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY TWO NINETEEN WILL START IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEE NON LET'S MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB. TWENTY TWO NINETEEN. AND FOR SUPPORTER OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWO NINETEEN PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. SECOND ONE ZERO FOR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. I'M SURE AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN OUR QUEUE. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MISS GARCIA YES I- I APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESSES I GREW UP IN A SMALL BUSINESS HOUSEHOLDS- MY SIBLINGS ARE ALL SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND CURRENTLY THERE ARE SOME SMALL BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES THAT ARE. R. E. J. HARD MEMBER THIS IS MY BUSINESS OWNER HIMSELF AND SO HE WOULD. TECHNICALLY FIT THE REQUIREMENT YOU YOU'RE PUTTING HERE I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. WHY YOU CHOSE THE EDC TO ALSO HAVE THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENT WAIVER LEVINE THAT TOGETHER. IS IT CURRENTLY WAS SMALL BIZ I'M NOT SHOULD THE BUSINESS MEMBERS THAT ARE ON- GREECE'S SUPPORT I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE FIFTY EMPLOYEES OR LESS. IT SAYS THE BUSINESS OWNERS BUT- SOME OF THE MARBLE CAN YOU ASK ME WHY WHERE TIENE THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPONENT TO THE ECJ SPECIFIC C. AND NOT SOMETHING ELSE ON THE BOARD. KERN APPOINTEES REQUIRED OF THESE TWO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE APPOINTEES IN EACH. THE SENATE RULES AND THESPEAKER MY BILL STILL KEEPS AT REPRESENTATION. AND UNDERSTANDS THE COMMUNITIES OF THE STATE THERE ARE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED. UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN THE PROVIDE INPUT AND HOW REGULATIONS MIGHT AFFECT THESE BUSINESSES. WHY WHAT WHY ARE YOU TARGETING THE E. J. SEATS ARE NOT SOMETHING ELSE FOR ADDING TO THE AIRPORT WHY SPECIFICALLY ARE WE ADDING THIS EXTRA COMPONENT TO THE AG SEATS THAT. WE HAVE. I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE REPRESENTATION FOR VOICES THAT DON'T HAVE A VOICE IN CALIFORNIA BUT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ON AIR RESOURCES BOARD. BUT WE DO HAVE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ON THAT FOR THAT HAVE LESS THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY PHILLY ARE BEING REPRESENTED PRESENTLY. MAYBE IT'S NOT GUARANTEED- AND SO. SO I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND OR READ DOING THAT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE HEAT OF AN AGENCY POTENTIALLY. OF NOT JUST TO THE POINT WE BY THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE TO HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT I KNOW THE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT THERE'S BUSINESS OWNERS. I AM NOT SURE IF THEY'RE FIFTY EMPLOYEES OR LESS. SO IF YOU GET THAT ANSWERED THEM THERE'S NO. NEEDED FOR THE BILL YES IF THEY IF THEY WITH ANSWERS. IT SAID THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE SMALLER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES I REQUEST. OKAY ARE YOU MISTER SPEAKER YOU'VE DONE SOLVED WHAT I MEAN IF I AND I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THINK IT'S NOTABLE THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE SMALL BUSINESS PLACES. ARE INCLUDED AT THE AIR DISTRICT AND IN THEORY. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DISCUSS I JUST DON'T SEE IT AT THE EXPENSE OF AN E. J. C. WHEN WE HAVE. HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT BLACK REPRESENTATION IN THE SEVEN TWO HARD FOUGHT FOR SEATS FOR MANY YEARS OUT THERE AND SO. I WOULD WANT TO SEE A DIFFERENT WAY TO GET TO YOUR GOAL AND SO IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE BOTH A PROBLEM IT'S- IT'S THAT IT'S THAT I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS I pWOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE. THAT WE GET THAT ANSWER ABOUT THE BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE AT THEIR DISTRICT AND- THE SIZE OF THEIR BUSINESSES- PERIOD FOR. FOR THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. IT APPOINTEE OF THE IN VAI MENTAL JUST. APPOINTEE IS A BUSINESS OWNER OF FIFTY LESS. EMPLOYEES WHOLEHEARTEDLY WOULD SUPPORT IT REALLY NARROW DEFINITION AND WITHIN THE EACH A COMMUNITY AT ADVOCATE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT NEEDS OUT THERE AND I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT ADDING AN EXTRA REQUIREMENT LIKE THIS ON THAT TO GET YOUR WILL OF HAVING SMALL BUSINESS REPRESENTATION. ON THE BOARD. OKAY MISTER SEA. OKAY SO IT'S A REALLY WHAT THIS DOES IS JUST GUARANTEE THAT THEY HAVE. THE SMALL BUSINESS DOES HAVE A SEAT AT THE BOARD WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE ONE NOW. IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE OTHER THAN THEY GOT LUCKY IN AND HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S THERE. THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE RAISED AND THEN THERE'D BE NO REPRESENTATION ALL THIS DOES IS ENSURE THAT THERE IS RAMPANT IN TATIAN IS THAT CORRECT YES SIR THANK YOU. MR STONE. THANK YOU THIS ABSOLUTELY DILUTES THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE REPRESENTATION ON THE AIRPORT AND I CANNOT SUPPORT. MR FLOOR I THINK IN IN THE LANGUAGE OF YOUR BILL AT THEM IN THE GOVERNOR HAS TWO APPOINTEES ASSESS THAT SHOCKING TO SHE CAN'T APPOINT TO PUBLIC MEMBERS CORRECT SIR SO CAN BE ONE OF THOSE TWO POSITIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR COULD APPOINT YEAH CORRECT. THEY WHICH DOES NOT NECESSARILY ATTACKING THE J. SEAT NECESSARILY NOT AT ALL YOU DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE WHERE IT COMES FROM NO. WE JUST WANT A SMALL BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVE ON THE BOARD OF UNDER FIFTY EMPLOYEES THANK YOU HAVE A POINT OF ORDER THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS THE AJC APPOINTED BY THE SENATE RULES CHAIR AND I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR BUSINESS IN THE ASSEMBLY TO TELL SENATE RULES. WHAT THEY SHOULD BE APPOINTING NOR SHOULD WE BE INTERFERING WITH A HARD FOUGHT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMPONENT ON THE AIRPORT AND I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM THE E. J. COMMUNITY. THIRTY THEY HAVE FOURTEEN APPOINTMENTS THAT THEY CAN HAVE THEIR I JUST THINK WE SHOULD HAVE REPRESENTATION FROM SMALL BUSINESS OWNER LESS THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES. ON THAT BOARD. OKAY MISTER MAKER. YEAH THERE ARE I THINK A DOZEN OR SO APPOINTEES ON THIS MANY FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS YEARS AGO WE ADDED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BECAUSE THOSE VOICES WERE NOT HEARD. LIKENESS GARCIA SAID VOICES IN THE SOUTHEAST LA THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THEY WOULDN'T HAVE VOICES FOCUSING ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE DOES MAINLY COME. FROM NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP SECOND REALLY ATTACHED TO THE ACUTE ISSUES OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE WITH OUR AIR AND SO I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I 100% ARE IN ACCORD WITH HERE IF YOU WANTED TO DO THIS YOU SHOULD ADD ANOTHER SEAT THAT SAYS THIS ANOTHER SEAT SHOULD BE A SMALL BUSINESS UNDER THIS AND THAT. BUT TO TAG ON TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SEATS DIMINISHES WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DID ADD THESE ADDITIONAL VOICES IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT SERVE ON THE AIRPORT. IN THE GOVERNOR COULD APPOINT TWO FOUR FIVE MORE MEMBERS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE COMMUNITY IF YOU WANTED TO I DON'T I'M NOT TECHNICALLY I THINK YOU GO BACK AND LOOK HOW THEY CREATE THIS BOARD A BUNCH OF THE SEATS ARE SPECIFIC TO REGIONS I KNOW THERE'S ONE HERE FOR THE SACRAMENTO REGION THEN MAINLY. ELECTED OFFICIALS AND A FEW YEARS AGO WE ADDED. A COUPLE AGENCIES WAS THAT- TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY. SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE YOU WANT TO SMALL BUSINESS VOICE ON THERE. YOU SHOULD GO BACK AND ASK ADD ANOTHER SEAT A NEW C. DON'T CAR ABOUT THE GAC. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY I BELIEVE FOR THE CURRENT APPOINTEE FROM SENATE RULES THAT'S R. E. J. C. IS ALSO A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER- AND SO. CURRENTLY MEETS BOTH REQUIREMENTS THAT DATA POINT T. R. BUT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE APPOINTEES. OF THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS UNDER FIFTY EMPLOYEES ON THE ON THE BOARD- BUT I DIDN'T GET THE INFORMATION BACK TO MY OFFICE THAT THEY'RE UNDER FIFTY EMPLOYEES. IF THERE IS I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT. THAT THERE ARE THREE. CURRENTLY FROM ACCORDING TO MY CONSULTANT LOOKED INTO IT YES THANK YOU. OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIBEL OKAY THANK YOU. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE- DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND I'M SO SORRY. WE HAVE A MOTION FOR MY MISTER FLORES SECOND BY MISTER MATHIS. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JERRY THIS HI RIVAS HI FLORA FLORA I FRIEDMAN GARCIA. GARCIA NO MATHIS MATHIS I MCCARTY. MCCARTY NUMBER CG. NOT VOTING SEYARTO HI SO YOU'RE TO AYE STONE.

AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER B. FIFTY FIVE EIGHTEEN WHICH ORDER TO STATEWIDE GOAL T ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. TO ITS CREDIT. CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN THE CHARGE AND HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN REDUCING ITS CARBON FOOTPRINT. WITH THE PURCHASE OF OUR GOVERNMENT. ELECTRIC VEHICLES NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR LAWN CARE EQUIPMENT. AND GOVERNMENT AND RESIDENTIAL RETROFITS FOR ENERGY SAVINGS. AS THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR NEWSOM SEE CREATIVE IDEAS AND SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGE AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SIX SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THE DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. WHILE AVOIDING A RETREAT AND OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SIX REQUIRES CC AND CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE AIR RESOURCES pSTANDARDS COMMISSION TO DESIGN A FRAMEWORK TO ACHIEVE AN 80% NET REDUCTION AND CARBON INTENSITY CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS USED IN NEW CONSTRUCTION BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WITH INTERIM GOALS OF 20% BELOW TWENTY TWENTY LEVELS AND BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THE BILL CALLS FOR THE FRAMEWORK TO BE DEVELOPED IN COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND EXPERTS IN ACADEMIA. INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. FINALLY AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SIX ALLOWS FOR THE INCLUSION OF TRACKING AND REPORTING MECHANISMS THAT WOULD FACILITATE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GOALS SET FORTH IN THIS BILL. AND A SYSTEM TO CREDIT. CARD FOR A SYSTEM OF CREDITS THAT CAN BE TRADED AMONG PRIVATE ENTITIES AND WE'RE TRACK THE TRANSACTION OF THOSE CREDITS.

GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS PATTY HARPER PATRIDGE AND I AM A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER AND LEAD PRINT THE POINT BRO HAPPEN TO NEARLY A GLOBAL CONSULTANCY FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND THE PUBLIC REALM WHICH NINETEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES IN THIRTY ONE LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE. I ALSO SERVED AS PRESIDENT ELECT FOR THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OVER ONE THOUSAND ENGINEERS ACROSS HALF THE STATE. OF THE NATION THIS IS AN ISSUE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO US. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SIX ISN'T. IMPORTANT IN ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. TO MEET THE ONE POINT 5 DEGREES C. CARBON BUDGET. ALL NEW BUILDINGS AND MAJOR RENOVATIONS MUST BE DESIGNED TO BE ZERO CARBON TODAY MATERIALS AND QUICKLY EMERGED AS A CRITICAL CONSIDERATION FOR CLIMATE MITIGATION AND RESPONSIBLE DESIGN PRACTICE. THE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IS RESPONSIBLE 440% OF GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT BUILDING CODES DO NOT TYPICALLY ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF THE BODY CARBON AND BILLY CAL THE PRODUCTS. IT FOR SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING MEANINGFUL CHANGE WE NEED TO REDUCE EMBODIED CARBON IN OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT. AS A PROFESSIONAL IN THE INDUSTRY I THINK ABOUT AND BODY CARBON EVERYDAY- HOBBLED ALONG WITH MANY OF OUR PEERS IS COMMITTED TO SB TWENTY FIFTY CHALLENGE TO MEASURE REDUCE AN ACHIEVEMENT HEROIN BY THE CARBON STRUCTURES BY TWENTY FIFTY. MY COLLEAGUES AND I NOW LOOK AT THE LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF CARBON IT VERY EARLY STAGES OF THE PROJECT WE FOUND A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN EMBODIED CARBON AND STRUCTURAL COST. ME NOT BY MEASURING AND REDUCING CARBON EARLY ON WE CAN DELIVER PROJECT THAT IS BOTH BETTER FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND ALSO MORE ECONOMICAL. IT IS CRITICAL WE GET A HANDLE ON A BODY CARBON NOW IF WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AT THE SIGNERS OF STORAGE OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT WITH THE EIGHTY TWENTY FOUR FORTY SIX AND A CRITICAL MEASURE NEEDED TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SIX WILL PROVIDE US WITH A FRAMEWORK TO BOTH MEASURE AND GRADUALLY BEGIN TO MANAGE. THE BODY CARBON IN OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THE BILL.

THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES WILL LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THANK YOU. NEXT I BELIEVE WE HAVE MR TANG AND- MISS IRWIN WILL BE PRESENTING WITH HIM. THIS IS ITEM. FIFTEEN AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MADAM CHAIR SO- AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR BUILT ON A BILL THAT MYSELF. AS A MEMBER IRWIN DID LAST YEAR EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN RECYCLE FOR REFORMS THE REFORMS ARE THINGS THAT WE SEE. VERY CALMLY IN THE SUPERMARKET OF THE CLAM SHELLS THAT STORE AT BARRY'S SILENCE TAKEOUT CONTAINERS YOU CAN YOU CAN IMAGINE OVERT COVERT HELP ME PICK UP CONTAINERS WE ALL USED OVER TIME. WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS TO ENSURE THAT THESE ITEMS ACTUALLY GET RECYCLED EVERYONE ASSUMES THAT BECAUSE THEIR PLASTIC THE TERM IN THE BLUE BIN THEY GET RECYCLED BUT ACTUALLY THAT COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH BEAUSE THERE'S A VERY LIMITED MARKET FOR THE SERVER FORMS- THEY ACTUALLY DON'T GET RECYCLED QUITE OFTEN END UP IN LANDFILLS. IT'S OUR BILL WOULD SET GUIDELINES AND GOALS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO HAVE 10% RECYCLED CONTENT IN THESE REFORMS A 20% RECYCLED CONTENT IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT AND 30% BY TWENTY THIRTY AND THIS BUILT UPON THE WORK THAT MYSELF AND MR WHEN DID A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO TO RECYCLE BEVERAGE BOTTLES SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AS THE DEMAND FOR RECYCLED BEVERAGE POLITICS GONE UP. THAT WE ALSO GET THE REFORMS BE RECYCLED AS WELL TODAY WE CAN HAVE A REALLY FULLY RECYCLABLE PLASTIC- CONTENT COMMUNITY- IN CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN OVER TO HIM EARLY THANK YOU- MR TANG AND L. AND AS MR TO MENTION THIS IS A REINTRODUCTION OF A BILL THAT VIEW OF VOTED FOR BEFORE AND BUILT UPON THE ACTION TAKEN BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO INCENTIVIZE THE RECYCLING OF. PLASTICS SO JUST TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT WE WHAT WE DID WITH THE BOTTLE BILL IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BEVERAGE BOTTLES WERE RECYCLED INTO BEVERAGE BOTTLES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REFORMS ARE RECYCLED INTO THERMAL FORMS BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED- DOWN. CYCLING IF YOU. IF YOU. WERE A BOTTLE COULD BE MADE INTO. OF BUT FORMS THEN WE'LL KNOW BE ABLE TO BE MADE AND TWO BOTTLES AND SO WE HAVE. SOME CONCERNS FROM THE AG INDUSTRY I WOULD HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED. TO FINDING A PATH FORWARD AT THIS YEAR WITH THE BILL- TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY OUR BALLCLUB- DIED. THE DAVY DUCK. BOB DAVID AXIO OF OUR PLANET EARTH AND THERE THE SPONSORS AND MARKET MARIE WITH CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THANK YOU OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OKAY THAT THANK YOU THIS IS- POPPED UP- FROM THE CO FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE COMPANY OUR PLANET EARTH SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH- CLOSE THE LOOP ON THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS USED IN FOOD AND BEVERAGE APPLICATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. WHY IS THAT WORKING MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENTS. MY COMPANY IS THE WORLD'S FIRST COMPLETELY VERTICALLY INTEGRATED RECYCLER AND MANUFACTURE. OF RECYCLED P. E. T. ALSO KNOWN AS OUR PET PACKAGING AND OTHER PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM POST CONSUMER BAIL AT THE PAINTERS. BOTH BOTTLES AND THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS WHAT WILL RECYCLING AND TURNING BACK IN THE NEW PRIMARY PACKAGING ANOTHER PRODUCT. WE HAVE VERY EFFICIENT MAKING IT PROCESS- WHICH GIVES UP THE CARBON FOOTPRINT THAT IS AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD FOR OUR- FOR THE PRODUCT THAT WE PRODUCE. THE REPORT CONTAINERS SHOULD CONTAIN THE MOST CALIFORNIA RECYCLE CONCEPT. ACTIVE IN THE UNITED STATES RECYCLE CONTENT HOWEVER THE PRIMARILY OF RECYCLED PLASTIC BEVERAGE BOTTLES. AT THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY MOVED THROUGH INCREASED THE- RECYCLED CONTENT TO COMPLY WITH EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY THREE. THE PERFORMANCE THE THREE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO TRANSITION THE CLOSING THE LOOP ON THE LOAN FROM THE FORM CONTAINERS. CONTAINER ARE HIGHLY RECYCLABLE IMPROPERLY COLLECTED SORTED AND PROCTER. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR REPRESENTS A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE THE PERFORMANCE THREE IS DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP WE DO A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING ENCOURAGE THE COLLECTION OF CALIFORNIA PROP THAT PLASTIC FEEDSTOCK NEEDED TO MAKE SOME APPOINTED TRAINERS FOR A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM. THERE IS A GREAT HELP OUT EMISSIONS AND LANDFILL A VERY VALUABLE COMMODITY. SPIKE IS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND PROVIDING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL USERS OF THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS. WE WANT TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHANGE. FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL HELP THE STATE MOVED TOWARDS ITS WASTE REDUCTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE GOAL. YEAH ON THE CLIMATE FRIENDLY REDUCTION A RESOURCE USING GREENHOUSE GASES. PLASTIC RECYCLING GENERATES JOBS AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. CREATE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY TO PRODUCE COLLECT RECYCLE AND PROFITS POSTED WHAT THE CAMEL FARM CONTAINERS. ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE OF OUR PLANET EARTH I'D LIKE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. LET ME TAKE A SECOND TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIANG AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN FOR THE PREVIOUS BILL ON RECYCLE CONTENT BECAUSE THAT MEASURE ON PT BEVERAGE BOTTLES IS ALREADY PAYING FINANCIAL DIVIDENDS THE CALIFORNIA LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND RECYCLERS. WITH RECORD HIGH SCRAP VALUES FOR THAT P. ET MATERIAL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING WITH PTP AND OTHER PLASTIC THERMOFORM PACKAGING. AT THE PREVIOUS WITNESS SPOKE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS COLLECTION INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA ALL WE NEED TO DO WITH THIS LEGISLATION IS PUT THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER SO- THIS BILL IS GOING TO CREATE AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR MAKING THAT HAPPEN- WE BELIEVE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECYCLE FORMAL FORM TO THERMAL FORM. IS GOOD FOR BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT BOTH FOR RECYCLING FOR DIVERTING MATERIAL FROM LANDFILL ASWELL AS WITH NOTED FOR REDUCING THE CLIMATE EMISSIONS FROM PLASTIC PACKAGING WE URGE AND I THOUGHT WITNESSES- IN OPPOSITION ONE I BELIEVE TESTIFYING IN PERSON MISTER LOUIS BROWN. FROM CON SWORDS AND CON WAY AND NEXT- BRUCE MEG NANI FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF PLASTIC RECYCLERS WHICH WE TEST FINE OVER THE PHONE. MISTER BROWN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MANAGER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRY COMMISSION CALIFORNIA BLUEBERRY COMMISSION CALIFORNIA APPLE COMMISSION AND A FEW OTHERS THAT ARE PROPERLY LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS UP FIRST DO YOU WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHORS FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD EXTENSIVELY LAST YEAR- OVER THE BILL AND HAVE STARTED AGAIN THIS YEAR- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE- AS HAS BEEN STATED BUT- SPECIFIC AS IT RELATESTO THE BERRY INDUSTRY. THE VERY INDUSTRY ENTERED INTO A NORTH AMERICAN AGREEMENT- TO ON ITS OWN INCREASE THE RECYCLED CONTENT USED WITHIN THE CLAM SHELLS THAT- WE NOW USE WITHIN THE BERRY INDUSTRY AND THE TRANSITION TO THOSE CLAM SHELLS WERE WERE MADE IN PART TO HELP. WITH STORAGE THOSE CLAM SHELLS HELP WITH TRANSPORTATION THOSE CLAM SHELLS HELP REDUCE DAMAGE OF BERRIES WHICH THEN ALLOW FOR THEM TO STAY ON THE SHELVES A LONGER AND ACTUALLY CONSUMERS TO ACCESS THEM. SO WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF INCREASE RECYCLED CONTENT BECAUSE WE THINK WE'VE BEEN LEADING ON IT AND IN FACT CREE COVE IT- MOST BERRY CONTAINERS- IF NOT ALL BERRY CONTAINERS I HAD OVER 20% RECYCLED CONTENT IN THEM BUT AS WAS POINTED OUT BY THE AUTHORS MOST OF THAT RECYCLE CONTENT CAME FROM. BOTTLES OUR CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS SET IS WE DON'T SEE AS OF RIGHT NOW HOW IT DRESSES THE BACK IN ISSUES OF ACTUALLY CREATING THE COLLECTION MECHANISMS. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TODAY WILL TELL CONSUMERS NOT TO PUT THESE. CONTAINERS IN THEIR BLUE BANDS AND IF SB THREE FORTY THREE MOVES FORWARD AND THESE CONTAINERS DO NOT RECEIVE OR ACHIEVE THE GOALS ESTABLISHING SB THREE FORTY THREE THAT WERE SIGNED LAST YEAR. THE ACTUAL CHASING ARROWS THAT SAYS THAT THE RECYCLABLE WILL BE TAKEN OFF OF THESE CONTAINERS. AND SO. THAT'S ONE ELEMENT THE OTHER ELEMENT IS YES THEY COULD BE SORTED TODAY- BY THE WASTE HAULERS BUT THEY'RE NOT. AND THE WASTE HAULERS ARE ACTUALLY PAID WHAT THEY CALL A CO MINGLED RIGHT. WHICH THEN ALLOWS THEM TO BRING PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES THERMAL SHIRT CLAMPETT THURMOND THERMAL FORM CLAM SHELLS TOGETHER AND GET PAID FOR THAT. WE THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE GREATER INCENTIVES SOMEONE CALLED THEM PENALTIES. ON CO MINGLE GREAT- WHERE WE'RE ACTUALLY ENTICING AND WORK INCENTIVIZE SEEN THOSE TO THOSE TO ACTUALLY BE SEPARATED AND THEN MADE INTO THERMAL FORMER CYCLE CONTENT. AND THEN IT'S FANTASTIC THAT IF THE BILL WERE TO SAY- THERMOFORMED THERMAL FORM WERE NOT CLEAR THAT IT SAYS THAT YET AND WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. OUR FINAL POINT IN CONCERN IS JUST WITH SOME OF THE LEVELS OF RECYCLING IN THE GOALS DOES A SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT- WE THINK THAT- THAT IS PROBABLY UNACHIEVABLE IN THE SHORT RUN. WE LOOK AT A BOTTLE BILL THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS BEEN HUGELY SUCCESSFUL- AND THE GOVERNOR I JUST ISSUED A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL LAST WEEK LOOKING TO ADD A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THAT PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY HE SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE THE RECYCLING RATES. OF CONTAINERS THAT ALREADY HAVE A DEPOSIT AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE BACK SO. WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. ARE THEY INSURMOUNTABLE NO WE HAD THE OPEN CONVERSATIONS LAST YEAR ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET THERE BUT WE DO THINK THAT THESE ARE SOME ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL STEPS THAT NEED TO BE PUT INTO THE BACK INTO THE PROP WITH THE PROCESS. TO ENSURE IT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RECYCLED CONTENT ELEMENT ON THE FRONT END. THAT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY COLLECTED SEPARATED BAILED AND PUT BACK INTO THE PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT CONTENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS IS TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE REPRESENTING THE ASSOCIATION OF PLASTIC RECYCLERS OPERATOR Q. PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE. LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. BUT CHAIR AND MEMBERS BRUCE MENYANYI ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PLASTICS RECYCLERS- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY- THE ASSOCIATION PLASTICS RECYCLERS HAS SUPPORTED MR THING IN THE PAST WE ORDERED THE MINERAL CONTENT AND BEVERAGE CONTAINERS- AND- ADDITIONALLY IN AB FOR. CORRECT ADDITIONALLY ON AB FOR SEVENTY EIGHT LAST YEAR- THE PHYSICIAN PRACTICE RECYCLERS HELD A SUPPORT AMENDED APPLICATION ON THAT LEGISLATION WE DO SUPPORT. THE RECYCLING OF ALL PLASTIC BUT AFTER MAKES FINANCING MISTER BROWN POINTED OUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT LIKE THE TO GO INTO A LITTLE MORE DETAIL- VOLUMES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS SITUATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- FORM SO P. REFORMS OF THEM MOST. RECYCLED OF ALL THE THERMAL FORMS AND THEY- ARE APPROXIMATELY LAST. TWENTY POINT TWO FIVE ONE POINT GOES THROUGH MADERA RECOVERY FACILITIES ARE BURST. ANNUALLY AND POLYPROPYLENE POLYSTYRENE ARE LESS THAN 1% OF THAT ONE PERCENT. CONSULT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE WE THINK IF THEY'RE STILL GONNA SIX FEET SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON P. P. THERMAL FORMS. AND NOT BE DISTRACTED BY BY THE OTHER TWO RATS AND I HAD WRITTEN- CHOICES ARE MADE. ON THE MATERIAL MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE THREATEN SAFE FOR INSTANCE ALL PROBABLY HAD FORMAL QUALITIES THAT CAN KEEP UP WITH THEM SO WE DON'T. BELIEVE WITH OUR KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERTISE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE ANY RESIDENTS WISHING. TO AVOID THIS TYPE OF REGULATION. BUT IT IS CHALLENGING AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT. THE AT EIGHT CARRY SUPPOSED THE BILL THIS YEAR IS IT- WHAT NEXT BROWN TALKED ABOUT THIS BILL BUT NOTHING TO ADDRESS THOSE VOLUMES AND COLLECTION AND SORTATION IN THE CO MINGLE GREAT LAST YEAR AB FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT DID SPEAK AND DID TRY TO ACHIEVE SOME TYPE OF COMPROMISE OR RESOLUTION TO THE COMMINGLED RATE BUT WHAT HAPPENS REALLY IN IN A MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITY IS AMER POPPER RIDER I CAN HAVE A VERY CLEAN BAIL OF P. E. T. BOTTLES WHICH WE WANT TO BECOME BOTTLES. AND THE COMMINGLED RATE THEY MAY GET UNDERPAID FOR THAT BAIL THEY HAVE SUCH A CLEAN. FAIL AND IF THEY- CALL ME AND PUT THERMAL FOR SPEAKING. NOT BAIL THEY COULD POTENTIALLY ARE MOST LIKELY YOU'RE GOING TO GET OVER COMPENSATED FOR THAT PARTICULAR BAILE SORT OF A PER PERSON SENATE. AND HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS TODAY. IT IS BROWN SAID I DON'T THINK THERE'S- THERE ARE HURDLES THAT CANNOT BE OVERCOME I THINK THEY CAN'T BE OVERCOME BUT UNLESS YOU ADDRESS ELECTION SORTATION. AND THE INCENTIVES THAT ARE PAID TO GET THAT COLLECTION. THEN WITHOUT THAT BEING RESOLVED IT JUST BECOMES THE TAX FOR A FEE ON MANUFACTURERS WITHOUT REALLY GETTING ANY CALIFORNIA FEEDSTOCK BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. SO WE WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT WE THINK IT CAN BE DONE WE SUPPORT MINIMUM CONTENT THE TICKET PRICE MARKET. BUT THE BILL IF IT'S CURRENTLY CRAFTED- UNFORTUNATE WE CAN'T SUPPORT. IN FACT WE HAVE TO OPPOSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- NEXT WE'LL MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR STARTING IN THE HEARING ROOM. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER HEARING ON BEHALF OF THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I'M NEXT OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION.

ONE TWENTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS DENNIS ALBION YUP YUP THE PLASTIC RECYCLING CORPORATION OF CALIFORNIA WE SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE TWO OPPOSITION WITNESSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ONE THIRTEEN. I COULD HAVE MADE SYMPATHETIC WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL- WE ARE CURRENTLY IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION CERTAINLY SUPPORT ESTABLISHMENT OF RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONTAINERS BUT FOR THE REASONS STATED BY MR BROWN AND- MR MADANI. IT BOTH ABOUT THE BENEFITS WORKING WITH THE UP UPON IT THEN THEY HAVE THE AUTHORS THANK YOU. FOR ONE TWENTY FIVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THAT THAT MIGHT ALIGNED ON BEHALF OF GERRY- THE CALIFORNIA WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT A COMPROMISE CAN BE FOUND. FOR ONE TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT THE CARROLL PATTERSON WITH THE SERVICE PACKAGING INSTITUTE AND WE ARE CLOSED AB. TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR. I AM SURE THE TIME WE HAVE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CLOSE. OF YEAH I'LL JUST. MAKE A FEW COMMENTS LOOK I REPRESENT AG AND THERE ARE A LOT OF- DIFFERENT INDUSTRY GROUPS INCLUDING DRISCOLL THAT ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE THIS WORK AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS A TOTAL BALANCING ACT- WE MAY NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF THERMAL FORM SO IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ENCOURAGE- COLLECTION IN THE RECYCLING BILL OF. CYCLING BEEN OF- THERMA FORMS AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT LANGUAGE OF. WE ALSO REALIZE THAT THERE MIGHT BE UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES REASONS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY AND- WE'RE WORKING TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS AND YOU ALSO BUT- THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE COMMINGLED RATES SELL WERE REMOVING DISINCENTIVES FOR THE VERSA COMMINGLED THERMA FORMS WITH BOTTLES AND- WORKING TO INCENTIVIZE IT'S THE FIRST TO SORT THEM SEPARATELY. YOU KNOW WE KEPT REFERRING TO THE BEVERAGE BILL AND OF MR TANG AND I WORKED ON THAT I THINK IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO THAT WAS A BILL THAT IT IT TOOK THREE OR FOUR YEARS TO PASS AND IT WAS AGAIN A BALANCING ACT AND SOME OF THE MEMBERS WERE COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO THE ENTIRE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING TV RIGHT NOW- THEY ARE THE THREE BEVERAGE COMPANIES ARE BRAGGING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO MEET 50% MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT AND THAT IS THE HIGHEST STANDARD IN THE WORLD. AND THEY ARE SAYING THAT THEY CAN DO IT SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT BILL IT TOOK A LOT OF HARD WORK AND IT TOOK A BIG BALANCING ACT AND WE EXPECT TO DO EXACTLY THIS WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE TO DO. IT JUST TO ADDRESS THE QUICKLY IF I LISTEN TO THE OPPOSITION I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT'S PRETTY IN THE BILL. SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE COMMINGLED RATE THAT'S BEEN TAKEN OUT WE ARE A RATE THAT NOW IT'S INCENTIVIZING ALL THE MERCH TO SEPARATE OUT THE PRODUCTS TO MAKE IT BETTER ARE YOU TO BE HEARD MISTER BROWN TALK ABOUT THAT THEY'RE ALMOST THERE ALREADY AT 20% WELL WE SAY 10% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND 20% BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. SO AGAIN IF THEY'RE ALREADY THERE I DID THAT SHOULD BE A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF WHY WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE RECYCLING ALL THE DIFFERENT CONTENT. MOST OF THE CONTENT THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING WAS PER BEVERAGE BOTTLES NOW ALL THE BEVERAGE BOTTLE MANY FACTORS. NEED THAT PRODUCT BACK FOR THE BEVERAGE BOTTLES SO REALLY TRYING TO CREATE A SO. ECONOMY FOR THERMAL FORMS THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES A SO. CALLED GOING BACK TO- MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS. AGAIN WE HEARD THE SAME. ISSUES WITH THE WATER BOTTLE INDUSTRY DIFFERENT BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS. AND BOIL THE HEAD IN HONG FOR TWO YEARS. AND NOW WHAT WE HEAR FROM MR MURRAY NOW WE HEAR FROM THE MANUFACTURERS I MEAN THEY'RE DOING LIKE. MISTER TALK ABOUT THEIR DOING ADS BRAGGING ABOUT. WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT FOR FOUR YEARS I THINK THIS WILL BE THE EXACT SAME THING THAT HAPPENS WITH THE REFORMS I THINK WE ARE RIGHT. THERE I EVEN LOOKING AT THE OPPOSITION I REALLY COULDN'T. DO REALLY HERE MANY THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN DISAGREED ON- SO IN TERMS OF THIS BILL THE TIMING'S RIGHT HAND THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY RECYCLED. RECYCLING THIS PLASTIC CONTENT. WITHOUT REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE DONE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS ON THE BILL AND- RESPECTFULLY I STRIVE VOTE ON AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU I HAPPENED TO SEE THAT. I WHAT I SAW THE COMMERCIAL LAST NIGHT- FOR THE BEVERAGE YEAH IT IT RIGHT BEFORE HIS HEARING RIGHT I THOUGHT IT JUST FOR YOU I THOUGHT OF. THEY THEY TARGETED ME RIGHT I'M JUST WATCHING TV LOOK PEPSI DR YEAH THE BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION ALONG WITH THOSE- WERE BRAGGING ABOUT. RECYCLING AND REUSING MATERIALS SO- PERFECT TIMING- I AGREE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THIS NOW WITH THE REFORMS AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT. YOUR BILL TODAY THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE A MOTION FOR.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS DRIVING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES HISTORIC DROUGHT EXTREME HEAT SEA LEVEL RISE IN FORCES UP THREATS ON HUMAN LIVES AND PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES ALIKE OUR ECOSYSTEMS ARE VITAL TO OUR ABILITY TO WITHSTAND RECOVER FROM EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS. ADD TO THIS END THE STATUS ADOPTED A VICIOUS CONSERVATION GOALS SUCH AS THE THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVE AS PART OF OUR CLIMATE RESILIENCE STRATEGY TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION PROJECTS HOWEVER REQUIRE PERMITS JUST AS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO. THE CURRENT REGULATORY PROCESSES FOR RESTORATION PROJECTS ARE TOO SLOW AND COSTLY A TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO ONGOING CLIMATE IMPACTS IN SOME INSTANCES UP TO A THIRD OF PUBLIC FUNDING FOR THESE RESTORATION PROJECTS CAN GO TO PLANNING AND PERMITTING. IT COULD TAKE YEARS OR DECADES TO COMPLETE THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE ISSUE BY REQUIRING DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO COORDINATE THEIR STREAMLINING EFFORTS. AND PROVIDE TIME SAVING RESOURCES FOR PERMIT APPLICANTS SO SPECIFICALLY. THE BILL REQUIRES DEPARTMENTS TO RESOLVE CONFLICTING A REDUNDANT PERMIT REQUIREMENTS- TO DEVELOP A SINGLE ONLINE SUBMISSION PLATFORM FOR APPLICANTS AND THEN FINALLY PROVIDE CONSULTATIONS TO APPLICANTS SO THEY CAN COMPLETE THEIR PERMITS MORE. EFFICIENTLY AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN.

AS YOU NO MICROPLASTICS ARE EXTREMELY PERSISTENT PERVASIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT HI MICHAEL PASS EXPERT FOUNDED AIR WATER AND SOIL AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING SAN FRANCISCO BAY. STUDY SHOWED THAT MICROPLASTICS ARE HARMFUL TO MARINE LIFE AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT. TO OTHER WILDLIFE AND YOU HEALTH. EXPERTS OF RECORD YOU SEE A PREVENTIVE CAN OF TO A- MICHAEL. POLLUTION THE REASON YOU WANT A LOT AT CAN. IS THAT THE CAN HAPPEN QUICK- IF WE TRY TO CONTROL IT BY. OTHER MEANS. WHAT'S THE POINT THE MAIN POINT IS TO GET RID OF THEM TO BEGIN WITH. BOB THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO CURB MY TO PLASTIC POLLUTION CLUED IN AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM WHICH PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BLOOM LEGISLATION BANNED THE SALE OF RINSE OFF. PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN MICROBEADS WHICH ARE MICROPLASTICS INTERVIEWS DESCRIBING AGENTS. EVER MICROPLASTICS ARE STILL WIDELY USED IN MANY CONSUMER. PRODUCTS INCLUDING COSMETICS DETERGENTS AND CLEANING PRODUCTS. WHICH UNTIL I TOOK UP THIS BILL I WASN'T AWARE OF- CONTINUED NONESSENTIAL USE OF MICROPLASTICS IN THESE PRODUCTS ALLOW MICROPLASTICS TO BE FLUSHED DOWN THE DRAIN. THEY LIKELY END UP IN SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS IN THE BIOSOLIDS AND THEN THEY CAN WHEN THE BIOSOLIDS TO SPREAD OVER FARMLAND OR OTHER LOCATIONS. ARE THEY CAN BE RELEASED TO THE SOIL INCLUDING FARMLAND AND END UP AND PEOPLE. THE EUROPEAN UNION IS PROPOSED REGULATIONS TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF MICROPRODUCTS IN THESE PRODUCTS TO BE IN COMPLETE ACCORD WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION STANDARDS. WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THEY'RE DOING YET SO BEFORE WE- FOR WE DO THAT WE WANT TO GO THROUGH IT BUT TO ME FOR THIS APPROACH TO BE. APPROPRIATE AND DOABLE WE REALLY WANT TO BE AS CLOSE AS WE CAN IDEALLY THE SAME AS THE EUROPEAN UNION. SO THAT THERE IS ALREADY SOMETHING THAT THE- BECAUSE MEDIC COMPANIES CAN DO THE FRANK WHICH COMPANIES COULD DO THAT IS COMPATIBLE- FOR WHICH THERE IS A MARKET AND THEN WE CAN ENCOURAGE THAT SAME- THAT SAME PROCESS TO BE BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA. AND HOPEFULLY TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. UP WITH ME TODAY IS PROFESSOR CHELSEA. ROCHMAN FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. THANK YOU OPERATOR WE HAVE OUR FIRST WITNESS TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE. THE LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES. PERFECT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR REVISED PLAN AND BY LARA AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM DOCTOR CHELSEA ROCKMAN AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WORKING AS A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING MICROPLASTICS SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN I STARTED MY PHD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I ALSO RECENTLY SERVED AS A COLD LEAD TO CALIFORNIA WORKING GROUP'S ON MICROPLASTICS SUPPORTED BY THE STATE WATER BOARD AND LED BY THE COURT ONE ON METHODS FOR QUANTIFYING IN CHARACTERIZING MICROPLASTICS AND ANOTHER ON RISK IN ADDITION I WAS ADVISOR TO THE OPC ON THEIR STATEWIDE MICROPLASTICS STRATEGY. THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC DOUBT THAT MICROPLASTICS ARE A WIDESPREAD CONTAMINANT. MICROPLASTICS CYCLE GLOBALLY AND THE DEATH CYCLE THE WATER CYCLE FOOD WEBS AND EVEN HUMAN RECENTLY BEING REPORTED IN BLOOD. LOCALLY IN COLLABORATION WITH AT THAT THE AYE WE FOUND RELATIVELY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF MICROPLASTICS IN SURFACE WATERS AND SEDIMENTS WITHIN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY WE ALSO FOUND AND LOCAL FISH AND SHELLFISH. TODAY THERE IS IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE THAT MICROPLASTICS CAN LEAD TO ADVERSE THE FACT. THE FACTORS INCLUDE DECREASED FEEDING DELAYED DEVELOPMENTS DECREASED REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND MORTALITY WITHIN OUR CALIFORNIA WORKING GROUP WE DEVELOPED A THRESHOLD COOPER RISK THAT ARE LOWER THAN THE CONCENTRATIONS WE OBSERVED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. ALTHOUGH DO WE DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW MICROPLASTICS AFFECT HUMAN HEALTH WE KNOW WE ARE EXPOSED TO BE A SEAFOOD DRINKING WATER AMONG OTHER SOURCES. THE GLOBAL CONTAMINATION AND EVIDENCE FOR LOCAL RISK EXACT GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDUCE SOURCES OF MICROPLASTIC NOW BEFORE THEY TRANSFORM ECOSYSTEMS ARE RAPIDLY. FOR MICROPLASTICS CLEANUP IS NOT FEASIBLE IT IS CRITICAL THAT POLICIES REDUCE PLASTIC POLLUTION AT ITS SOURCE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY SOURCES OF MICROPLASTICS POLICIES THAT TARGET ONE AT A TIME ARE RELEVANT AND EFFECTIVE. FOR EXAMPLE WE NOW THERE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PLASTIC MICROBEADS AND LAKE ONTARIO SURFACE WATER THAN WE DID BEFORE THE MICRO BEAD REGULATION IN CANADA. COMBINED THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO RISK A CONTAMINATION SUPPORT AB T. SEVEN EIGHT SEVEN HE EXPAND LEGISLATION AROUND PLASTIC MICROBEADS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I'D BE VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS TODAY OR IN THE FUTURE WITNESSES TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION BOTH IN PERSON. NICOLE CAN YOU HONEST REPRESENTING THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION. AND MANDY LEE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL. GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING CHAIR RIVAS MEMBERS ADVOCATING COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MANDY LEE AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL. HERE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN A MASSIVE NEW PROPOSAL TO REGULATE MICRO PLASTICS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHICH AS DRAFTED WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF BANNING MANY COSMETIC AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS TODAY. I AM JOINED TODAY ON THE LINE WITH DR IAN DAVIES OF PC PC DR DAVIES HOLDS A BSE AND BIOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEE AND UNIVERSE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. AND A PHD IN ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK ALSO IN THE U. K. THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL IS A LEADING NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER SIX HUNDRED MEMBER COMPANIES IN THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MICRO PLASTIC. POLLUTION IS A PROBLEM THAT WILL REQUIRE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. BUT AS DRAFTED AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS OVERLY BROAD FAILS TO CONSIDER MANY OF THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED INNOVATIONS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY AND SEEKS TO ADDRESS ONLY 1% OF THE TOTAL PROBLEM THEY'RE EXTRAORDINARILY HARSH MESSAGE MEASURES. THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IN THEIR PROPOSED STATEWIDE MICRO PLASTICS STRATEGY IDENTIFIED MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THE MICROPLASTICS POLLUTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND JUST AS A REMINDER THOSE CATEGORIES WERE VEHICLE TIRES TEXTILES SINGLE USE FOOD WHERE PACKAGING AGRICULTURE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE. ADDITIONALLY A STUDY IN THE E. U. ALSO RESEARCH THE ISSUE OF MICROPLASTICS AND FOUND THAT THE PRODUCTS TARGETED IN AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN. ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO LESS THAN 1% AND MORE SPECIFICALLY ZERO POINT GLOBALLY. NOT ONLY IS IT TROUBLING THAT AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN TARGETS ONE OF THE LOWEST CONTRIBUTORS TO THE OVERALL MICROPLASTICS PROBLEM. BUT DEPENDING ON HOW MICROPLASTICS IS ULTIMATELY DEFINED THE FACT OF THE BILL WOULD DECIMATE AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY BY BANNING MANY OF THE COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT CONSUMERS FIND ESSENTIAL TODAY. FOR A LOW AND IN SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT. THE REASON THIS BILL REPRESENTS A DE FACTO BAN IS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A ONE TO ONE SUBSTITUTE FOR MANY OF THE NON PLASTIC POLYMERS THAT WE USE TO MAKE OUR PRODUCTS WATERPROOF LONG LASTING. AMONG MANY OTHER USES THAT CONSUMERS FIND USEFUL. AND BECAUSE OF THIS BANNING ANY OF THESE POLYMERS WOULD REQUIRE US TO REFORMULATE THE ENTIRE PRODUCT. AS WELL AS FIND A SUITABLE SUBSTITUTE WHICH WILL TAKE SEVERAL DECADES. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER REMEMBER THAT ALL PLASTICS ARE POLYMERS BUT NOT ALL POLYMERS ARE PLASTIC. MANY OF THE POLYMERS THAT OUR INDUSTRY USES TODAY ARE LIKE WHEN A WAX FORM AND ARE NOT PLASTIC PARTICLES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PLASTIC MARINE LITTER PROBLEM. AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE STATEMENT THAT MICRO PLASTICS ARE UBIQUITOUS IN THE WATER AND AIR BECAUSE OUR INDUSTRY IS A LOW CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROBLEM WE WOULD POINT TO THE SOURCES REFERENCED ABOVE. AS POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN US. THE FACT OF THE MATTER THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE E. U. HAS BEEN DEBATING THIS ISSUE OF MICROPLASTIC REGULATIONS FOR ALL PRODUCTS SINCE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN IN CONJUNCTION. WITH NGOS ACADEMIA ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND INDUSTRY AND THEY'RE STILL NOT DONE YET. THIS EFFORT SHOWS HOW COMPLEX THIS ISSUE IS AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO GET IT RIGHT. WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO WHAT THE E. U. HAS BEEN UNDERTAKING FOR YEARS IN THE MATTER OF MONTHS. HOWEVER THERE ARE CONCEPTS IN THE E. U. DRAFT THAT WE COULD SUPPORT ALIGNMENT WITH. AND BECAUSE OUR MEMBER COMPANIES OPERATE GLOBALLY IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ACHIEVE 1100% UNIFORM ALIGNMENT WITH THE EU MY COLLEAGUE NICOLE CAN YOU OWNERS WILL WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE MAJOR POINTS OF BUT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE IN PARTICULAR. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHAT EXAMPLE LEAVE ON BECAUSE SHOULD EXEMPT LEAVE ON COSMETICS WHICH ARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE WASHED DOWN THE DRAIN. THINK ABOUT YOUR MASCARA YOUR LIPSTICK YOUR NAIL POLISH. THESE ARE PRODUCTS THAT IN MANY CASES REQUIRE THE CONSUMER TO REMOVE WITH EITHER A MAKEUP WIPE. OR MAKE UP REMOVER AND A COTTON PAD AND SOLID WASTED. NEVER ENTERING INTO THE WATERWAYS THESE PRODUCTS AT THESE PRODUCT CATEGORIES ALSO REPRESENT A MUCH SMALLER PORTION OF THE POINT 2% CONTRIBUTION TO MICROPLASTICS REFERENCE ABOUT. WE ARE HEARTENED TO HEAR THE AUTHOR STATEMENT COMMITTING TO FULL ALIGNMENT WITH THE E. U. HOWEVER WITHOUT THE CHANGES- THAT WE NEED TO THE BILL TO ACHIEVE THAT FULL ALIGNMENT WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU NICOLE CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION- THE LEAD FRAGRANCE FREE DISSOCIATION COMPRISING OF BUSINESSES ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORGET SUPPLY CHAIN. AS WELL AS THE HOUSE IN A COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WHOSE MEMBERS INCLUDE MANUFACTURERS OF PRODUCTS IMPACTED THIS BILL INCLUDING DETERGENTS WAXES AND POLISHES. WE ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR EXPRESSING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY TO A LINE AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WITH THE POLICIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY IMMEDIATELY. IN ADDITION ALL SPEAK QUICKLY ABOUT FRAGRANCE ENCAPSULANTS- IN THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO ALIGN WITH THE REGULATION. FIRST FRAGRANCE ENCAPSULATION IS ONE OF THE LEADING SENT DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES USED BY THE FRAGRANCE INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER PRODUCT COMPANIES FURTHER FRAGRANCE ENCAPSULATION INTO TERGITE REPRESENTS ONLY POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO FOUR THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF A PERCENT OF INTENTIONALLY ADDED MICROPLASTICS. ENCAPSULATION IS THE MOST RESOURCE EFFICIENT WAY OF DELIVERING FRAGRANCE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PERFUME BY USED BY ROUGHLY 33% WHILE ALLOWING THE SENATE TO LAST LONGER. WHEN USED IN DETERGENT THIS CAN LEAD TO SOME ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS CONSUMERS WILL WASH TEXTILES LAST THE LONGER THE SENATE LAST WHICH LEADS TO REDUCE WATER USE AND LESS ENERGY CONSUMPTION. AND ALSO FEWER MICROFIBERS GOING DOWN THE DRAIN WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A MUCH LARGER CONTRIBUTOR OF MICROPLASTICS IN THE ENVIRONMENT THEN THE PRODUCTS WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY. DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE SUSTAINABILITY BENEFITS OF ALL IN CAPS LET'S THE E. U. BUILT INTO THEIR MICROPLASTICS REGULATION A BIO DEGRADATION STANDARD BASED ON INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED WE C. D. AND ISO TESTING STANDARDS SO TRULY BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS ARE NOT BEYOND. THE INDUSTRY SEES THIS AS THE ONLY VIABLE PATHWAY AVAILABLE TO INNOVATE AND CONTINUE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF ENCAPSULATION. A BIODEGRADABLE STANDARD TO ALLOW MORE SUSTAINABLE BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY TO HAVE AN AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS BEING TAKEN TO ALIGN THE MICROPLASTICS DEFINITION OF MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DEFINITION USED IN THE U. THERE ARE STILL SOME DISCREPANCIES AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN MUST INCLUDE A MINIMUM THRESHOLD TO AVOID UNNECESSARY ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATION. ADDITIONALLY IN ORGANIC POLYMERS SHOULD BE EXEMPTED WITHOUT AN EXEMPTION INGREDIENTS LIKE FUSED SILICA KAELIN CLAY'S NOT SHELLS AND CELLULOSE WOULD ALSO BE BANNED. FOR SO MANY PRODUCTS THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVES AND IF CALIFORNIA GOES BEYOND THE EUROPEAN UNION ENTIRE SECTORS SUCH AS FLOOR POLISHERS MARKET WILL FACE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE STILL OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WILL OPEN IT UP TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION STARTING IN THE HEARING ROOM. K. OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE. I'M OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN PLEASE JUST STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL. DILIGENT IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. AT THIS TIME WE DO OF ABOUT THIRTEEN IN OUR QUEUE.

SHARKS GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES IN OPPOSITION. NINE ONE THIRTEEN. CAN YOU THINK WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL UP FOR THE REASONS STATED OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. SURE AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE. THANK YOU- WILL BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER WHAT. A PERSONAL THANK YOU MISTER CORPORATE RING THIS BEFORE A COUPLE JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR. I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHY THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY WHICH REPRESENTS A TINY PORTION. OF MICROPLASTICS WHEN YOU'VE GOT NINETY NINE PLUS PERCENT OF OTHER FERTILE GROUND OUT THERE SO CAN YOU SPELL. THE REASON I THINK FOR THAT NUMBER HAS TO DO WITH RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE ON THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY BY THE ESTUARY INSTITUTE. WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT THERE'S ALMOST NO POLLUTION COMING OUT OF THE SENATE. THE FROM THE SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS THE BIG PROBLEM WITH STORM RUNOFF AND WITH STORE RUNOFF YOU GOT TIRES AND FIBERS. PERHAPS THE FIBERS YOU'RE COMING FROM- WASHING MACHINES I'M NOT SURE. HOWEVER WE DO DO NOT ONLY FROM THIS- THAT THIS BILL EXCUSE ME FOR THAT NOT ONLY ARE THE SOURCES OF PLASTIC BUT THERE'S ALSO THE PLASTIC COMES OFF FROM OUR CLOTHES WE WASH THEM. BUT IT ISN'T COMING OUT OF THE SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT SO WHERE IS IT. I THINK THE ANSWER IS IT'S IN THE BIO SOLIDS IN THE PLANTS. BUT IT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE SYSTEM BUT THAT ISN'T MEASURED IN TERMS OF WHAT GOES INTO THE BAY NOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE BIO SOLIDS. IS THERE GOING OUT- AND THERE'S A- MAJOR- EFFORT NOW TO GET THEM OUT ON TO FARM LANDS TO BE USED AS FERTILIZER. THAT MEANS OF THE PLASTICS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF OUR WASHING MACHINES AND- THE GOING DOWN THE DRAIN IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE'RE GOING TO END UP ON A FARM LAND. FOR WHICH THEY WILL GET INTO STREAMS ETCETERA SO WELL IT'S NOT A MAJOR SOURCE OF POLLUTION TO THE BAY. WHICH IS WHERE THE RESEARCH WAS DONE IT IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF POLLUTION. ANYWHERE WHEN YOU TAKE THESE BIOSOLIDS AND PUT THEM ON PLANT. THAT'S FARMLAND THAT'S FOOD CONTAMINATION THAT'S HUMAN CONTAMINATION. THAT'S CONTAMINATION OF WATER IN STREAMS. DO YOU DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE PROBLEM THAT IS I MEAN WHY NOT BURY THE BIOSOLIDS RATHER THAN USE THEM FOR FERTILIZER. WELL I WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT. AND IF WE DID THAT WE WOULD NEED THAT BILL BUT THAT'S NOT THE DIRECTION THE STATE'S GOING IN. SO YOU KNOW. IF YOU IF YOU THINK THAT ALL THE BIOSOLIDS SHOULD GO INTO SANITARY LANDFILLS THEN YOU WOULD NEED THE BILL. BUT THE STATE WANTS TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO USE THOSE BIOSOLIDS ON FARMLAND. AS LONG AS YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT YOU BETTER MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAVE PLASTICS- SO FIRST I NEVER SAY I'M I'M HAPPY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THE E. U. IS DOING- YEAH AND I HAVE TO LOOK. IF I DON'T ALIGN WITH THE E. U. THEN THERE'S NOT REALLY CALIFORNIA I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH OF A MARKET. TO RELEASE TO STAY THE STRATEGY WE REALLY HAVE TO ALIGN WITH THE E. U. OR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT NOW IS WHAT TO THE E. U. STANDARDS DO AND WHAT DID THEY NOT DO. AND IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY DON'T DO THAT WE CAN LIVE WITH FINE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO. SO PARTICULARLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A VERY HARD LOOK AT THE DEFINITION. OF BIODEGRADABLE MY FEELING IS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THERE BECAUSE IN THE END I THINK THE END UP IN THE BIOSOLIDS SO IT'S HARD TO SIT HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THEY WOULDN'T BY THE GREAT BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS. STILL WANT TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THAT BOB BUT- YOU KNOW IN THE END I THINK WILL BE WITH THE E. U. STANDARDS. SO A CLOSE LOOK AT THAT IN THERE IN THE PROGRESS OF THIS BILL YEAH DURING THE PROGRESS OF THIS BILL. THEN ONE FINAL QUESTION THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME AND I COULD TALK SCIENCE WITH THIS GUY OKAY. YEAH THE OTHER QUITE THE OTHER COMEDY CAME UP WAS YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT. YOU KNOW MASCARA OR WHATEVER THEY JUST WEST OF. IF THE E. U. DOESN'T REGULATE THEM NEITHER WILL WE BUT WE DO WANT TO. ALIGN WITH THE YEARS SO THAT'S- YOU KNOW WE'LL SEE WHERE THAT GOES. I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I WILL BE WATCHING FOR SURE. AS YOU SHOULD YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CLOSE YES- ABOUT ANSWERING MISTER WHICH QUESTIONS I THINK GETS ITS THEIR- THESE LIKELY ARE ENDING UP IN THE BIOSOLIDS WHICH GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE. AND YOU KNOW IF THERE WERE NO ALTERNATIVE. THAT WOULD BE ONE THING BUT THE YEAR WAS COMING UP WITH REGULATIONS WHICH IN THE LONG RUN I THINK THIS BILL WILL COMPLETELY ALIGNED WITH WE STILL UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE BETTER- BUT I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GO. AND THERE'S NO POINT DISTRIBUTING PLASTIC. CROSSED THE STATE IF WE CAN FIND OTHER SUBSTITUTES SUCH AS BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS THE COULD DO THE SAME WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR KIRK WE HAVE A MOTION.
