00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.079
WE FIRST START WITH THAT

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:51.050
BENEFITS PAID TO OUR MEMBERS

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:53.652
60% OF THOSE BENEFITS PLUS

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:55.154
SIXTY PLUS PERCENT OF THAT

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:58.290
COMES FROM INVESTMENT RETURNS.

00:10:58.357 --> 00:10:59.859
THESE ARE NAPA RETURNS NET OF

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:05.231
FEES. WHILE 55% OF THE

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:09.702
PORTFOLIO. THAT'S BETTER ACCESS

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:10.269
TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.938
DOLLARS TODAY 55% OF IT IS

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:16.942
MANAGED IN HOUSE WHEN IT WAS

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:17.510
TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:20.780
BILLION THAT FIFTY FIVE

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.883
PERCENT. COST US ABOUT THIRTY

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:24.950
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:28.120
APPROXIMATELY TO MANAGE THAT

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:28.654
WAS THE COST OF INTERNALLY

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:33.626
MANAGING. FOR THE OTHER 45%

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:35.194
WHICH WAS MANAGED BY OUTSIDE

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:39.432
MANAGERS IT WAS A BILLION EIGHT.

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:41.834
NOW HAVING BEEN A PERSON WHO

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:44.804
REALLY REVIEWED MANAGERS- WHEN

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.205
I WAS WORKING FOR THESE FAMILY

TRUST. I BEGAN TO SEE THE AT

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:51.944
FEES THAT WERE CHARGED YOU KNOW

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:53.879
THE TWO ONE TWENTIES THE 20%

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:56.415
BEING THE FEES THAT ARE CALLED

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:59.151
PROMOTES. THAT ADDS UP TO A LOT

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:01.854
OF MONEY. SO IF WE'RE PAYING

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:03.823
6270% OF THE BENEFITS TO OUR

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.492
MEMBERS. AND WE CANNOT PREDICT

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.160
WITH ANY CERTAINTY NO ONE CAN

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.662
WHAT KIND OF RETURNS WERE GONNA

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:12.631
GET WE CAN PREDICT OUR COSTS.

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:14.633
IN TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.570
REDUCE OUR COSTS. THAT WILL BE

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:20.206
A BENEFIT TO OUR MEMBERS. AN

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:23.442
EVALUATION- WAS MADE- AND IT'S

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.277
APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:26.612
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.814
A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE THAT WE

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:31.750
SAVE BY INTERNALLY MANAGING. SO

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.786
THAT'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:34.286
DOLLARS IT GOES INTO THE

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:35.588
POCKETS OF TEACHERS. SO TO THE

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.423
EXTENT THAT WE CAN INTERNALIZE

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.924
MORE MANAGEMENT OF OUR

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:41.160
PORTFOLIO. I THINK THAT THE

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:43.896

EXTENT THAT WE CAN DO THAT I

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:08.988

COLLEAGUE OF I THINK THAT THE

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:23.636
BOARD IS GOING TO BE WELL

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:25.571

TRACK. FOR FULL FUNDING BY

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:42.655
TWENTY FORTY SIX I THINK THERE

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:44.089
WERE SOME CONDITIONS TO THAT

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.891
COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE ON.

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:46.892
IT'S PRETTY HARD TO TELL THE

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.628
WHOLE PLAN TO GET IF THE TWENTY

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:50.696
FORTY SIX BUT WHAT IS THE MAYBE

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:52.765
THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS.

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:55.067
OF THAT CONTRACT TO GET IS

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.703
THERE BY TWENTY FORTY SIX

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.205
MILLION YOUR OB PROFESSIONAL-

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:03.809

DON'T HAVE A PER. JOB ABOUT.

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.881
THE PLAN I'VE ONLY BEEN THERE

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:09.882
FOR NINE MONTHS BUT I WILL TRY

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:11.917
TO GIVE YOU THE BEST ANSWER I

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.453
CAN. BEING RELATIVELY NEW. ONE

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.423
OF THE THINGS THAT THE- THE- AB

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:20.392
I THINK WAS FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.061
THAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:25.331
FOURTEEN. DID IT PROVIDED FOR

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:29.435
SOME FLEXIBILITY FORECASTERS TO

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:31.470
ALLOCATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.206
PAYING INTO THE FUND. AND YOU

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:35.908
KNOW FROM FOR AGAIN FOR THE

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.276
EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYEE AND THE

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:42.548
STATE. AND SO THAT'S THAT 3240%

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:43.449
DO YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:45.384
MAKE UP THAT THAT THAT THE THAT

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.019
THE INVESTMENT RETURNS DON'T

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:53.225
PROVIDE. SO THAT IS DETERMINED

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:55.694
WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS THAT EVERY

00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:57.296
FIVE YEARS THERE'S AN ASSET

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.031
LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:02.134
IS ADOPTED. AND THIS IS WHERE

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.370
I'VE BEEN. I GOT AN EDUCATIONAL

00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:06.272
KERR POINT ON THERE BUT- BUT

00:15:06.338 --> 00:15:10.876
THE ACTUARIES DETERMINE WHAT

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:12.344
OUR OBLIGATIONS WILL BE OVER

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:16.615
TIME. AND THEN THEY WORK WITH

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:18.217
THE INVESTMENT TEAM TO

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:23.322
DETERMINE WHAT THE- RISK. A

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:24.723
COMPONENT WILL BE RISK RETURN

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.158
COMPONENT WILL BE AND SO THEN

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.027
WE DO AN ASSET ALLOCATION THAT

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:30.896
ASSET ALLOCATION ALSO PROVIDES

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.364
FOR A DETERMINATION OF WHAT ARE

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:34.667
PROJECTED RETURN WILL BE ARE

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:37.670
PROJECTED RETURN IS 7% NOW

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:39.138
PEOPLE SAYING THIS LOW RATE

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:40.839
ENVIRONMENT HOW CAN YOU DO THAT

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.441
WELL THIS IS LOOKED OUT OVER A

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:44.943
PERIOD OF TIME TEN YEARS. AND

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.178
IF HISTORY IS BROUGH THIS

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:47.913
ANYTHING HAS PROVEN ANYTHING IS

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.415
THAT THE LAST TEN YEARS WERE IN

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.016
DOUBLE DIGIT RETURNS YOU KNOW

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:52.785
OVER THE TEN YEARS. NOW THAT

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:55.287
WAS A GREAT MARKET. SO I GUESS

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:57.356
IS A LONG ANSWER BUT I I'M JUST

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:59.091
TRYING TO HELP. PUT IT IN

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:01.327
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT. BASED ON

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:02.895
THAT WE CAN DETERMINE THE

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:05.898
IMPACT. THAT IT WILL HAVE ON

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:07.966
THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PLAN.

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:09.802
AND THAT'S IT BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:10.602
TO PROJECT OUT WHAT OUR RETURNS

00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:12.838
WILL BE. SO THAT'S HOW WE

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.640
DETERMINE HOW WE KEEP IN ON

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:16.408
TRACK TO GET TO NINETEEN FORTY

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:19.011
SIX. IT'S WITH ACTUARIES AND

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:20.045
INVESTMENT TEAM WORKING

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:21.680
TOGETHER ONE OF THE THING I'D

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:23.215
LIKE TO ADD. BECAUSE I THINK

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.049
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:25.651
UNDERSTAND- AND MAYBE YOU DO

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:28.320
BUT- I DIDN'T. AND THAT IS

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.556
REALLY HOW COLLABORATIVELY. THE

00:16:30.622 --> 00:16:33.659
TEAM WORKS. AT CAL STARS. I

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:35.227
MEAN IT IS IT IS REALLY TRULY

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:37.062
REFRESHING BECAUSE I YOU KNOW

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.464
WATCHING ASSET MANAGERS IN THE

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.466
PRIVATE SECTOR. EVERY PORTFOLIO

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:42.167
MANAGER THINKS HE OR SHE IS THE

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:43.936
SMARTEST PERSON IN THE ROOM.

00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:45.537
BUT THERE IS THIS GREAT

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:48.273
COLLABORATION AMONG- THEM THE

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.175
PEOPLE THAT WORK AT CAL STIRS.

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:51.810
AND I THINK IT'S A TESTIMONY TO

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:53.412
THE LEADERSHIP THEY'RE- BOTH IN

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:55.013
THE INVESTMENT SIDE IN ON THE

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.415
ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE. IT'S BEEN

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:58.016
TERRIFIC BECAUSE I I'VE SEEN

00:16:58.083 --> 00:16:59.551
LOTS OF INSTITUTIONS AND YOU

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:02.521
KNOW COMPANIES THAT DON'T HAVE

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:04.690
THIS VALUE DRIVEN LEADERSHIP. I

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:05.424
APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW WAS

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:07.259
KIND OF CALM. BUT HAVING SERVED

REMINDED ME I GUESS OF ALL OF

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:18.971
THE DIFFERENT MOVING PARTS IN

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:20.939
IT IS BASED ON PROJECTION AND

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:23.008
PAST HISTORY. IN THE ON YOU

OUTSIDE THE AND IN TALKING

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.519

GOES ON THERE. THAT SUBSTANTIAL

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:36.722
ESSENTIAL TO I THINK

GREATEST PUBLIC SERVANTS OUR

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.769

IN MAKING SURE THAT WE DELIVER

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.107
SHOWN THROUGH TODAY WHICH I

LOOK. IN TO. SERVICES AND

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:44.122
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO

00:18:44.189 --> 00:18:45.457
REALLY- I WAS JUST CURIOUS WHAT

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:48.260
THE RATIONALE. WAS OR IS FOR

00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:50.329
THE- OUTSIDE VERSUS INSIDE

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.097
ASSET MANAGEMENT SPLIT THAT YOU

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:56.702
REFERRED 255405% AND WHAT AND

00:18:56.768 --> 00:19:00.839
WHETHER RISK MANAGEMENT- ASSET

00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:02.608
DIVERSIFICATION PLAYS ANY ROLE

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.009
PLAYED ANY ROLE IN THAT

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.411
DETERMINATION. JENNIFER

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:08.413
QUESTION OR TWO GAS AND YET

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.948
THEY'RE THEY'RE PROBABLY- I'LL

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:11.750
BREAK IT DOWN INTO TWO PARTS IF

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:14.052
I MAY. THE FIRST PART IS WHEN

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.388
YOU HAVE A PORTFOLIO- AS LARGE

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:19.224
AS THIS OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW YOU

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:22.494
HAVE TO- SPREAD YOUR RISK. IN

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:23.896
THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT YOU

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:26.932
KNOW IS DIFFERENT BUCKETS OF

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:29.067
ASSETS THAT YOU TO INVEST IN SO

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:32.004
THAT IF FOR EXAMPLE EQUITIES

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.239
ARE IN THE TANK MAY BE FIXED

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.608
INCOME AND INFRASTRUCTURE

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:40.078
INVESTMENTS ARE DOING WELL YOU

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:40.646
KNOW OR OR AT LEAST HOLDING

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:44.816
THEIR OWN. SO THAT IS WHY YOU

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:46.618
HAVE YOU KNOW THE DIVERSITY OF

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.554
INVESTMENTS IS TO PROTECT

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.658
YOURSELF AGAINST- RISK- WITH

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:55.394
REGARD TO ASSETS BEING MANAGED

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.428
INTERNALLY AS OPPOSED TO

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:59.565
EXTERNALLY THE KISS STORY PLEA-

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:02.768
CAL STIRS AS I UNDERSTAND IT-

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:04.836
WAS ALL EXTERNALLY MANAGEMENT I

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:06.538
THINK MANY PENSION FUNDS HERE

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:07.439
IN THE STATES WERE ALL

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:09.174
EXTERNALLY MANAGE FOR A LONG

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:11.877
PERIOD OF TIME. I THINK THAT

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:14.346
THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT-

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:17.683
THERE WAS A RECOGNITION. THAT

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:19.484
OTHER LARGE INSTITUTIONAL

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.120
INVESTORS WERE. GETTING BETTER

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:25.023
RETURNS NET RETURNS BY BRINGING

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.059
THOSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN

00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:31.396
HOUSE. AND I THINK PROBABLY THE

00:20:31.463 --> 00:20:34.433
GROWTH OF INDEXED EQUITY

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:36.301
INVESTING WHICH MAKES IT A

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:38.203
LITTLE BIT EASIER YOU DON'T

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.606
HAVE STOCK PICKERS YOU HAVE YOU

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:42.374
KNOW INDEX FUNDS THAT YOU

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:44.977
INVESTED. I THINK THAT PROBABLY

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:47.079
ASSISTED IN IN IN MOVING IT UP

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:52.584
MORE QUICKLY. THE THERE'S IN

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:54.353
CANADA FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:57.522
MANY PENSION FUNDS WHICH IN

00:20:57.589 --> 00:21:01.026
BASICALLY HAVE ALL OF THE

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:01.560
MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS AN

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:05.263
INTERNAL. AND I THINK THAT THAT

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.767
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS- THAT WE

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.736
ULTIMATELY FACE IN DOING THAT-

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:12.771
HERE IN IN IN IN THE STATE'S IN

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:17.476
CALIFORNIA. IS THAT WORSE WE

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:20.946
HAVE- AN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:24.916
AND. AND PENSION BENEFITS

00:21:24.983 --> 00:21:26.385
COMPANY TO TWO DIFFERENT KINDS

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:27.786
OF COMPANIS AND CAL STAR SO

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.521
YOU KNOW WE MANAGE IT WE

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.223
INVESTMENT MANAGE AND WE ALSO

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:33.291
PAY PENSION BENEFITS SO WE'VE

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:35.227
GOT REALLY PRIVATE KINDS OF

00:21:35.293 --> 00:21:38.130
BUSINESSES WE RUN BUT SUBJECT

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:39.498
TO A LOT OF THE STATE

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:43.635
REGULATORY YOU KNOW EMPLOYMENT-

00:21:43.702 --> 00:21:45.470
YOU KNOW BURKE LOS. AND SO TO

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:47.639
THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WE'VE

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:51.376
BEEN MOVING- TOWARD.

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:53.278
INTERNALIZING AS MUCH AS WE CAN

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:56.281
AND SO I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT

00:21:56.348 --> 00:21:58.550
AS TIME GOES ON. YOU KNOW WE

00:21:58.617 --> 00:22:00.185
WERE GONNA PROBABLY NEED TO

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:03.188
HAVE- MORE FREEDOM IN HIRING

00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:05.824
PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT BE SUBJECT

00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:07.526
TO THE CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THE

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:09.594
CIVIL SERVICE REQUIREMENTS NOW

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:12.064
I SAY THAT. NOT KNOWING ENOUGH

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.299
REALLY BUT I KNOW THAT IT TO

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:15.467
THE EXTENT THAT WE WANT TO

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:17.402
MANAGE INTERNALLY A LOT OF

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:19.905
ASSETS- WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:22.140
KNOW OF A WE NEED TO HIRE GOOD

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:24.209
PEOPLE AND GOOD PEOPLE ON THE

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:26.945
OUTSIDE. MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:27.446
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.815
CHALLENGE. I WAS GOING TO ASK

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:31.783
IF THERE WERE STATUTORY OR

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.317
REGULATORY IMPEDIMENTS TO

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:37.422
MOVING. AWAY FROM THE FIFTY

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:38.590
FIVE FORTY FIVE SPLIT IN TERMS

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:40.659
OF OUTSIDE VERSUS INSIDE

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.828
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND IF SO

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:44.129
WHAT THOSE ARE I SUPPOSE WE

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:46.131
COULD SAY THAT FOR ANOTHER DAY

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.066
AND ANOTHER CONVERSATION WELL

00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:49.534
AND- AND HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:50.969
THAT'S BETTER INFORMED AND I

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.171
BECAUSE- AT THIS POINT IN TIME

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:54.206
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO ENGAGE

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:55.707
IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT I CAN

00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:57.909
TELL YOU THAT I IN ANYTHING YOU

00:22:57.976 --> 00:23:01.413
CAN. HELP DO THAT. I THINK THAT

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.482
IS WELL INVESTED MONEY. WELL I

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:05.484
WILL SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.351
I MEAN AS I RECALL WE HAVE THE

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:08.487
SAME. WHENEVER THE STATE-

00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:11.356
ENGAGES IN OPERATIONS CENTER.

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:13.225
OF EXACTLY THE SAME REQUIRED

00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:14.192
SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE

00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:16.228
COMMERCIAL SIDE ENGAGES AND WE

00:23:16.294 --> 00:23:18.296
HAVE A PROBLEM AND- WE HAVE THE

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:19.898
SAME SITUATION OR SOMETHING

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:21.733
SIMILAR IN THE INSURANCE.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.702
BUSINESS WHEN WHERE WITH THE

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:26.104
STATE FUND AND OUR WORKERS ARE

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.405
ARE FORAY INTO THE WORKERS

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:30.475
COMPENSATION FIELD AS WELL IN

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:32.711
TERMS OF. PAYING PEOPLE ENOUGH

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.846
MONEY TO COME IN AND HELP US

YOU SENATOR- I THINK THAT ONE

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:09.507
OF THE THINGS THAT IF YOU'RE

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:12.744
GOING TO- ASK SOMEONE TO DO

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:14.846
SOMETHING IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:17.782
IT YOURSELF. IT'S PRETTY HARD

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:19.951
TO MAKE THAT ASK AND I CAN TELL

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.786

CAL STIRS. THAT A SIGNIFICANT

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:28.627
NUMBER OF OUR PORTFOLIO

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:32.230
MANAGERS ARE WOMEN. AND SO- CAL

00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:34.532
STIRS NOT ONLY TALKS THE TALK

00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:36.701

EXAMPLE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE A

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.376
LARGE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR.

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:48.914
AND YOU CAN POINT TO YOUR

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.249
ARE MANY WOMEN THERE THE WOMAN

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:54.920
WHO THE GLOBAL EQUITY SWITCHES

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.655
FORTY SOME ODD PERCENT OF THE

00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:58.823
TOTAL PORTFOLIO. IF PORTFOLIO

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.059
MANAGER THAT THAT ASSET CLASS

00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:07.465
WOMAN SO- THAT'S NUMBER ONE YOU

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:10.502

ANY DETERMINATION. WITH A

00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:19.878
MANAGER TO DETERMINE THAT AND I

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.513
KNOW THAT IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:23.181
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE OF

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.883

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.651
IMPORTANT ISSUE. BUT AGAIN I

00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:28.787

00:26:28.853 --> 00:26:31.957
EXAMPLE ENGAGE SO THAT YOU HAVE

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:33.291

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.194
PERSON YOU'RE TALKING TO AND

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:37.729

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:45.503
DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS THE

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.639
QUESTION IT DOES LOUIS IT LET

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:50.542
ME ASK- OBVIOUSLY IT'S

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:52.711
INTENTIONAL. I AM IN DIVERSITY

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:54.079
DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN IN ANY WAY

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:55.714
SHAPE OR FORM IT'S INTENTIONAL

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.615

EMPLOYEES AND WE DO IT AS BEST

00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.737
WE CAN AND I THINK WE DO A GOOD

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:49.040
JOB. I THINK THE BOARD ITSELF

00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:51.209
ESPECIALLY IF WE GET. NEW

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.479
APPOINTEES OR MORE APPOINTEE'S

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:55.146
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:57.815
PARTICIPATE. IN THAT PROCESS AS

00:31:57.882 --> 00:32:01.219
WELL. ON MEETING WITH LABOR

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:03.288
MEETING WITH BUSINESS MEETING

00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:07.091
WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS. ON COULD

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:12.096
TO HELP- EDUCATE THE PUBLIC.

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:13.998
OUR STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT WE

00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:16.734
DO AND JUST SORT OF WHO WE ARE

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:17.935
WHICH KIND OF LEADS TO MY

00:32:18.002 --> 00:32:20.305
SECOND POINT- IN A MORE

00:32:20.371 --> 00:32:22.607
CHALLENGING THING. I THIS

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:29.280
BOARD- IS A BOARD IN WHICH OF

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:31.582
BOTH THE LABOR SIDE IN THE

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:33.051
MANAGEMENT SIDE AND I'VE MET

00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:37.822
WITH BLOW OFF. ARE DISSATISFIED.

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:40.391
ON MUCH OF THE TIME AND

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:44.195
FRUSTRATED AND- YOU KNOW IT'S

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:45.830
SORT OF AN OLD WE SAY IT ALL

00:32:45.897 --> 00:32:46.831
THE TIME WELL EVERYBODY'S ON

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:47.932
HAPPY YOU MUST BE DOING

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:49.367
SOMETHING RIGHT BUT THE FACT OF

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:50.635
THE MATTER IS IF EVERYBODY'S ON

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:53.338
HAPPY PROBABLY THINGS CAN BE

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:56.574
IMPROVED NOW YOU CAN'T IMPROVE

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:58.810
THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:02.747
ADVERSARIAL- UP A BOARD THAT

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:05.183
DEALS WITH RESOLVING. ISSUES

00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:07.819
BETWEEN ADVERSARIES IT IS NOT

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:10.355
YOU KNOW- BUT THAT KIND OF A

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:13.558
FEEL GOOD INSTITUTION IT'S LIKE

00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:15.426
A COURT IT IS A COURT AND EIGHT

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:18.796
ADJUDICATES CLAIMS SO WE CAN'T

00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:21.733
SUGARCOAT THAT. WHAT ON FROM

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:24.435
THE PERSPECTIVE OF LABOR THESE

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:25.770
CASES ARE LITIGATED IN

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.605
LITIGATED IN LITIGATED FOR EVER

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.574
WHICH SORT OF UNDERMINES THINGS

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.676
EVEN IF YOU WIN AND FROM THE

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:33.611
PERSPECTIVE OF THE EMPLOYERS

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:35.079
THEY FEEL FRANKLY THAT THEY

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:38.716
NEVER WITH. AND SOMEWHERE IN

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:40.952
BETWEEN ALL THAT LIES THE TRUTH

00:33:41.018 --> 00:33:45.089
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO. IS TO TRY

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:47.258
TO WORK REALLY HARD AND THIS

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:48.659
GOS BACK TO MY FIRST POINT

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:51.963
ABOUT. BEING OUT THERE WITH THE

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:54.999
STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE THEM FEEL

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:57.301
SOME CONFIDENCE THAT WHETHER

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:59.437
THEY WIN OR LOSE AND NOBODY'S

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:01.372
ENTITLED TO WIN AND YOU KNOW

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:03.107
EVERY TIME OR LOSE EVERY TIME

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:05.710
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT- BUT TO

00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:06.878
THE EXTENT THAT THEY NGUYEN IN

00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:09.380
THEY LOSE. THEY WENT IN THEY

00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:12.083
LOSE BECAUSE THE PROCESS WAS

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.653
FAIR AND IMPARTIAL. AND THAT

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.088
THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:19.290
THEY'RE BEING HEARD AND NOT

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:22.026
BEING DISMISSED AND THAT'S A

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:25.196
TALL ORDER- BUT I'D LIKE TO USE

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:28.166
MY TIME ON THIS BOARD TO TRY TO

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:32.003
MOVE THAT NOTION FORWARD. SO

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:34.505
THAT THIS BOARD BECOMES A

00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:38.075
LITTLE LESS OF AN AREA IN WHICH

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:41.312
ON ALL SIDES FEEL AGGRIEVED AND

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:44.415
MAYBE ALL SIDES FEEL MOVED

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:45.883
TOWARDS YEAH YOU KNOW I DON'T

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.585
ALWAYS WIN BUT YOU KNOW WHAT

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:52.190
IT'S FAIR. SO WITH THAT I AM

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:52.690

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:29.300
IN ALL OF THESE LABOR LAW

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:33.738
SYSTEMS AND THE IT'S HEARD BY-

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:36.040
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:38.175
THEREFORE MOST OF THE CASES

00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:41.312
THT WE- HEARD HAVE GONE

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:43.013
THROUGH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.448
DUE PROCESS BEFORE THEY GET TO

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:46.117
US WE'RE LIKE THE COURT OF

00:39:46.183 --> 00:39:50.254
APPEALS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:52.690
VERY DISTILLED. IN ISSUES THE

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:54.859
POWER. A LINE WE'RE NOT

00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:56.627
REVIEWING THE WHOLE THING OVER

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:58.796
AGAIN AND SO BY THE TIME IT

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:01.632
GETS TO US IT'S A MUCH MORE

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:05.569
DISTILLED. FACT SITUATION.

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:07.438
OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY NEEDS TO.

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:09.106
RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES BECAUSE

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:10.841
THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:13.377
PARTIES BUT IT ALSO SHOULDN'T.

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:16.514
SURPRISE PEOPLE ON THE THAT

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.017
MOST OF THOSE CASES IF MOST OF

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:25.289
THOSE CASES GO IN FAVOR OF- OF

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:27.992
THE ARM. OF THE GENERAL

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:30.427
COUNSEL'S POSITION PURSUING A

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:32.663
CHARGE THAT WOULD NOT BE

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.099
UNUSUAL IT'S NOT AN UNFAIR

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:37.434
PROCESS IF IT'S NOT A FIFTY

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:40.171
FIFTY THING. IN FRONT OF OUR

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:42.807
BOARD ANY MORE THAN WE WOULD

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:45.810
THEN WE WOULD THINK THAT THAT

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:49.213
ON THAT A DISTRICT ATTORNEY

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.583
THAT NGUYEN YOU KNOW WHO LOSES

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.819
50% OF THEIR CASES IS DOING A

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:57.021
GOOD JOB OR THAT THE PROCESS IS

00:40:57.087 --> 00:40:58.989
FAIR THAT'S PROBABLY A DISTRICT

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:01.559
ATTORNEY WHO'S- CHARGED CASES

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.293
THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:04.995
CHARGED. SO WOULD WE WOULD

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:06.964
EXPECT THAT THE PROSECUTION

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.899
WINS MORE CASES AND THAT

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:09.767
DOESN'T MAKE THE PROCESS

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:12.102
INHERENTLY UNFAIR IT FITS

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:14.038
WORKING RIGHT THAT'S HOW IT

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:15.673
SHOULD BE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:16.574
PEOPLE DON'T PUT UP A VIGOROUS

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.210
DEFENSE AND ATE A WIN BUT IF

00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:21.011
YOU CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY DRAW A

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:23.414
CONCLUSION THAT THE PROCESSES

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.250
ON IS BIASED AROUND FARE- BOMB

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:29.153
FOR THAT REASON. AND THE AND

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.621
THAT'S THE CASE WITH US SO THAT

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:31.789
WAS THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:32.957
THE IT WAS VERY GOOD BECAUSE

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:34.758
PERCEPTION BECOMES REALITY IN

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:36.727
SOME OF THESE ISSUES WE HAVE

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:06.156
THAT THEY WILL HAVE THEIR- OF

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:07.690
FOLKS ON THE STREET GO AND GET

SUPPOSED TO BE THERE SO IS THE

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:19.235
ONGOING BATTLE. BUT WE ARE VERY

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:20.570
MUCH UP TO THE CHALLENGE OF

00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:21.671
TRYING TO IDENTIFY ONE

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:23.873
RESOURCES INTO IDEALS. AND

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.575

DELEGATION YOU'RE PART OF TO

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:34.083
NORWAY AND YOU SHARED WITH ME

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.386
SOME OF YOUR SKEPTICISM IN THE-

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:37.887
NOISE A LITTLE MORE HOMOGENOUS

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:39.522
THAN. CALIFORNIA'S PRISON

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:41.825
SYSTEM. BUT YOU DID SHARE SOME

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:43.726
TAKEAWAYS AND MAYBE MY FINAL

00:57:43.793 --> 00:57:45.395
QUESTION IF. WHAT WERE SOME OF

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:48.064
THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT YOU THINK

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.966
COULD HAVE CURRENCY IN.

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:51.501
CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SYSTEM

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:52.569
I THINK THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAY

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:54.437
FROM A SENATOR AS YOU SAID I

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:56.339
WAS A LITTLE SKEPTIC. CONAN

00:57:56.406 --> 00:57:57.106
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:57:57.173 --> 00:57:58.842
X. BACK. BUT THE REALIZATION

00:57:58.908 --> 00:58:00.210
THAT HIT ME BY THE SECOND DAY

00:58:00.276 --> 00:58:01.377
OF BAND THERE AND REALLY

00:58:01.444 --> 00:58:02.478
ENGAGING WITH THE STAFF

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:04.314
ENGAGING WITH THEIR POPULATION.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.549
IS NOT ABOUT THE TYPE OF

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:08.618
OFFENDER REALLY REALLY WANT TO

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:09.619
BOIL DOWN TO WAS THE

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:11.087
INTERACTION BETWEEN STAFF AND

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:12.722
THE OFFENDER. THAT AT THE END

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:13.890
OF THE DAY THERE WAS A MUTUAL

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:16.326
RESPECT THE ENGAGEMENT WITH SO

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:17.961
MUCH DIFFERENT. THAT IT INSURED

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:19.696
AND WORK TOWARD SAFETY FOR

00:58:19.762 --> 00:58:21.598
EVERYBODY AND I THINK THAT IS.

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:23.132
SOMETHING THAT I TOOK AWAY

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.500
SOMETHING THAT AS A DIVISION WE

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.069
WILL BE WORKING ON. IS HOW DO

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:27.804

A MORE HUMANE ENVIRONMENT. THAT

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:34.043
THE END OF THE DAY ARE

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.712
INDIVIDUAL GOING HOME. AND WE

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.380
