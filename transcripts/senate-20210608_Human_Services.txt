YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR FOUR FIVE REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT THAT REGIONAL CENTERS NEED TO COLLECT PERSONAL PARENTAL INFORMATION AS A CONDITION FOR PROVIDING SERVICE. REGIONAL CENTERS OR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT COORDINATE SERVICES FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- FEDERAL FUNDING RULES REQUIRE THEM TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM PARENTS. IN ORDER TO SERVE THEIR CHILDREN THESE RULES CHANGED YEARS AGO BUT STATE LAW HAS NOT. REGIONAL CENTERS DON'T NEED THIS INFORMATION AND NO FEDERAL FUNDS ARE TIED TO IT. AB FOUR FOUR FIVE REPEALS THE OUTDATED REQUIREMENTS REMOVING A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO SERVICE AND ELIMINATES A BUREAUCRATIC HURDLE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS AMY WEST LANE FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF RGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES AND GLORIA WONG FROM EASTERN LOS ANGELES REGIONAL CENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY WHAT'S GOING ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF AB FOUR FOUR FIVE. AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN CALDERON NOTED THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD HELP REMOVE BARRIERS FOR ACCESS FOR PEOPLE. YOU MAY NOT HAVE PERSONAL INFORMATION LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS READILY AVAILABLE AND WILLING TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH RESULT IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THOSE CRITICAL SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WE WANT TO THANK. ASSEMBLY WOMAN CALDERON FOR AGREEING TO AUTHORED THIS BILL AND I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO GLORIA WONG. DIRECTOR OF EASTERN LOS ANGELES REGIONAL CENTER TO SHARE ADDITIONAL DETAILS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MY NAME IS GLORIA HUANG I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE EASTERN LOS ANGELES REGIONAL CENTER THERE ARE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH SERVE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SH EASTERN LOS ANGELES REGIONAL CENTER NOW REFER TO US AS THE LORD GOD AS AN ACRONYM IS ONE OF THE SEVEN. REGIONAL CENTERS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND IT SERVES APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ARE UNIQUE DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDE 71% HISPANIC FAMILIES AND 13% IS REPRESENTED BY OUR ASIAN COMMUNITY WE REPRESENT PARTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CALDERON SHOULD DISTRICT. ON A REGULAR BASIS WE FIND THAT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES SEEKING REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES DO NOT ALWAYS FOLLOW THROUGH AFTER THE INITIAL INTAKE MEETING. FAMILY SIMPLY STOPPED RESPONDING AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS DROP OFF IS IKELY THE RESULT OF PRIVACY CONCERNS. THERE WAS A CASE THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH WHERE A MOTHER WHO WAS GOING THROUGH THE ELIGIBILITY PROCESS FOR HER TEENAGE SON. SHE SURE THAT THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST HAD REFERRED HER TO THE REGIONAL CENTER BECAUSE YOUR SON WAS EXHIBITING BEHAVIOR SIMILAR TO THAT OF A PERSON WITH AUTISM. MOTHER SHARED THAT HER SON HAD NO FRIENDS OFTEN WAS BULLIED AND THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN AND SAFE PREDICAMENTS DUE TO THE UNFILTERED COMMENTS HE MADE TOWARDS OTHER STUDENTS. SHE FEARED FOR HER SON'S SAFETY INVESTORS DESPERATELY WANTED TO ACTIONS REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. SHE STRUGGLED BETWEEN ACCESSING MUCH NEEDED SERVICES FOR HER SON BUT ALSO FOR YOUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHAT RAMIFICATIONS WOULD RESULT FROM THAT DISCLOSURE. SH AB FOUR FOUR FIVE THREE MOVES THIS YEAR BY REQUIRING AND NEEDED PERSONAL INFORMATION FAMILY SIMPLY CHOOSE NOT TO REGISTERED WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER THIS MEANS A TRIAL LIKE THE ONE I'VE JUST DESCRIBED WILL GO WITHOUT CRITICALLY NEEDED SERVICES THAT HE OR SHE IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE.

SKINNER THERMOSTAT SENATOR TOM LONGER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I KNOW I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BUT I ACTUALLY DO HAVE BROADER ISSUES WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES BUT- IT DOES REVOLVE AROUND AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A THREE OF THEM IN MY DISTRICT- BUT THE INCONSISTENCY WITH WHICH THE EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE RUN. AND HOW THEY MAKE AVAILABLE THE RESOURCES TO THEIR CLIENTS HOW THEY MAKE AVAILABLE ALL OF THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEIR CLIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES- THESE ARE FAMILIES THAT ARE OFTEN TIME MOST IN NEED- IN THE MOST VULNERABLE STATES. AND ARE INCREDIBLY DEPENDENT ON THE INTEGRITY OF THAT PARTICULAR REGIONAL CENTER TO GIVE THEM THE FULL MENU OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE RATHER THAN PARSING THEM OUT. BASED ON WHAT THEY FEEL THEY WANT TO OFFER OR THE KIND OF VENDOR THAT THEY FEEL THEY WANT TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE FAMILY SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THOSE THINGS I THINK IT WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THEM BUT SINCE YOU'RE WITNESSES ACTUALLY FROM ONE OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS IT WAS INCUMBENT UPON ME TO LET HER KNOW AND YOU AS THE AUTHOR NOW THAT THERE ARE LARGE ISSUES- IN OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY AS IT RELATES TO OUR REGIONAL CENTERS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT CLARIFIES THAT FAMILY REUNIFICATION SERVICES NOT BE BYPASSED IF A PARENT WITH A DRUG ADDICTION SUFFERS A RELAPSE AFTER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING DRUG TREATMENT. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY NEARLY 8% OF CALIFORNIANS MET THE CRITERIA FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RELAPSES ARE REGULAR OCCURRENCE IN REHABILITATION JOURNEYS INCLUDING IN INDIVIDUALS ACTIVELY SEEKING TREATMENT. IF A FAMILY BECOMES INVOLVED WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THEY SHOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY LOSE ACCESS TO REUNIFICATION SERVICES IF A PARENT HAS RELAPSED. THIS BILL PASSED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY UNANIMOUSLY AND HAS TO OPPOSITION. WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT R.

WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN DO BEST WITH THEIR FAMILY. EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD CODIFY RECENT APPELLATE COURT DECISION IN RIGHT B. E. AND CLARIFY THAT A PARENT CANNOT BE DENIED REUNIFICATION. BECAUSE WHAT HAS BEEN DEEMED PASSIVE RESISTANCE TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. ESSENTIALLY THAT MEANS THAT PARENTS WHO HAVE SUCCEEDED IN TREATMENT IN THE PAST BUT IT SIMPLY RELAXED. WOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO REUNIFY WITH THEIR CHILDREN. THIS PARTICULAR CHANGE SIMPLY RULING. OUT THE JUDICIALLY CREATED DOCTRINE OF PASSIVE RESISTANCE RETURNS THE STATUTE TO ITS ORIGINAL MEANING A GIVE COURT THE AUTHORITY TO LOOK AT EACH FAMILY. AND IDENTIFY WHETHER A PARENT HAS TRULY REDUCE TO TREATMENT OR IF YOU SIMPLY HAD TO STUMBLE IN THEIR SOBRIETY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COMPORTS WITH THE SCIENCE BEHIND DRUG TREATMENT. WE KNOW THAT RELAPSE IS COMMON EVEN FOR THOSE IN LONG TERM SOBRIETY. PLEASE CHANGE WILL ALSO PROVIDE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REUNITE WHENEVER POSSIBLE. EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD ENSURE THAT RELAXES NOT MEAN THAT A PARENT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO LOSING THEIR CHILDREN FOREVER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.
