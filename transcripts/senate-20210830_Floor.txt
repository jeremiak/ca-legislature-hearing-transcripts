AS YOU RECALL OF THIS LEGISLATION OR THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY FOR CITIES- GIVES US IT IS A- VOLUNTARY- STREAMLINED- PROCESS FOR REZONING NON SPRAWL AREAS FOR SMALL MULTI UNITS- WE- IN THE ASSEMBLY WE REMOVED IT'S ALWAYS FROM THE BILL- IN ADDITION- MADE CLEAR THAT OPEN SPACE AND SIMILAR- BALLOT MEASURES COULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY THE BILL. IN ADDITION TO OTHER- TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS- COLORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. WILL. THANK SENATOR WIENER THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON SB TEN ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGH NATT YES SIR CENTER GLAZIER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS IN HIS WHOLE- HOUSING SPACE THERE'S BEEN A SPIRITED DEBATE ACROSS THE STATE THIS YEAR AND IN THE PAST YEARS FOR GOOD REASON. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS AND I APPRECIATED ADMIRE ALL THE AUTHORS AND- BUT MANY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE FLOOR WHO HAVE. I STEPPED INTO THIS SPACE. WITH THOUGHTFULNESS. WITH RESPONSIVENESS TO THE CONCERNS THAT OUR RESIDENTS HAVE OUR CITIES HAVE. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. GIVEN ALL THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL THAT I STAND HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TEN. I BELIEVE THIS BILL EMBODIES THE CONCERNS THAT MANY OF US HAVE. THAT THESE CHOICES ON HOUSING SHOULD BE DONE IN A WAY THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THIS BILL DOES JUST THAT. IT PUTS THE POWER COMPLETELY IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL. JURISDICTIONS TO UTILIZE THE TOOLS IN THIS BILL OR NOT. YEAH YEAH TELL ONE PARTICULAR CONCERN THAT'S BEEN EXPRESSED HIS. THE CONCERN THAT A LOCAL CITY COUNCIL. CAN OVERRIDE. HEY LOCALLY APPROVED REFERENDUM OR INITIATIVE IN THIS AREA OF LAND USE THE AUTHOR IS TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO NARROW THE POTENTIAL- LIKELIHOOD OF THAT OCCURRING THAT IS ALSO RAISE THE THRESHOLD FOR ANY SUCH ACTION TO TWO THIRDS VOTE. OF THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FOR MANY CITIES THAT HAVE FIVE MEMBERS OF THEIR COUNSEL IN ESSENCE IT WOULD REQUIRE 80% TWO I DECIDE TO TAKE SUCH AN ACTION AND OF COURSE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. FOR ANY SUCH ACTION AND AS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT I STAND HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB TAX. THANK YOU SARAH GLAZER SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TO ECHO- WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM AROUND IT JUST SAID- I'VE HEARD A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE A SPIRITED DEBATE IN ORANGE COUNTY OVER THIS BILL- THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE IN THE STATE ARE FACING A HOUSING CRISIS AND IT IS A CRISIS. I GUESS THE NUMBER ONE REASON PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE STATE- IT'S A CHALLENGE TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR NEW ENTRANTS IT'S BECOME A BARRIER TO PRODUCTIVITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE STATE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO BALANCE THOSE CONCERNS. ARE WITH THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KEEP THE CHARACTER THEIR COMMUNITIES WHO WANT TO KEEP THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS- THE WAY THEY WERE WHEN THEY BOUGHT THEM AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES THAT IF HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF BOUNCING BETWEEN COMPETING CONCERNS ALL RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS- AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR MICHAEL THE CONSENSUS GO FOR CONTINUING TO BE OPEN TO TAKING AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE. THAT WE HAVE A LIGHT TOUCH LOCAL CONTROL ORIENTED APPROACH- BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE PROGRESS- SO I WENT TO A SUPPORT THIS BILL AGAIN AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FROM SAN CISCO FOR ALL HIS HARD WORK ON. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS ARE MAKING SOME ODD MINUTES TO THE BILL THAT WERE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN REGARDING THE IMPACTS TO OUR RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES- AND IN PARTICULAR ON THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED THROUGH CCN OURS WHICH ARE CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS- I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU ALSO REMOVED THE- ABILITY OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO OVERRIDE. A CITIZENS INITIATIVE OUR QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS THAT CORRECT. CENTER IN ORDER. YES HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM SO THE- WHAT WE DID WE CHANGE THAT PROVISION- SO THAT- CITY COUNCIL CANNOT DO ANYTHING THE TYPES- AND OPEN SPACE PROTECTION GREEN BELL. PART ACTION ATLANTA PROTECTION THAT'S ALL JUST DONE EXCLUDED FROM THE BELL CATEGORICALLY FRANKLY WAS PROBABLY NEVER IN THERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN FILL DEVELOPMENT WE MADE A VERY EXPLICIT AND NUMBER THOSE LIMITED MEASURES THAT COULD BE IMPACTED OTHER THAN ALL THE OPEN SPACE ARE GROUNDED CETERA ON THE REQUIRED TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE COUNCIL SO WE TIGHTENED IT UP DRAMATICALLY- AND I NARROWED DRAMATICALLY. THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME ON MISTER PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO READ IF I MIGHT A JUDGMENT THAT JUST CAME FORWARD FROM THE HEART. A JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT IN SAN DIEGO REGARDING- OF. ONE OF MY CITIES A CITY OF ANTHONY DOVE FOUNDATION REGARDING OUR THEIR PROPOSITION A WHICH IS A LOCAL INITIATIVE REGARDING OUR DEVELOPMENT IT SAYS STATE LAW PROVIDES SUBSTANTIAL TOOLS OF ENFORCEMENT. TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS- OF AN ADEQUATE HOUSING ELEMENT INVALIDATING THE CITIZENS RIGHT TO VOTE SHOULD ONLY BE A LAST RESORT. WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE BEFORE THE COURT THE PRESENT DISPUTE HAS NOT REACHED THIS LEVEL. FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS REQUEST A DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS DENIED AND I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I AM VERY PLEASED THAT THE COURT. IS GIVING A VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ONTO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL THAT THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE ON THESE PARTICULAR INITIATIVES REGARDING. LOCAL PHONING SINGLE FAMILY ARE HUGE WE HAD FOUR PAGES OF CITY COUNCILS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE REGISTERED THEIR OPPOSITION THEY HAVE SPECIFICALLY CITED SOME VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES SIZE OF LOT. PARKING RESTRICTIONS ALL OF THESE EFFECTS. ARE CERTAINLY PUBLIC SAFETY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND A LOT OF CONSTERNATION COMES TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SPECIFICALLY REGARDING. THE THE SETBACKS THE NOISE IMPACTS CAN CERTAINLY ACCESS TO THOSE PARTICULAR LOTS BY PUBLIC SAFETY. PERSONNEL SO I WILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO THESE UNTIL THOSE PARTICULAR CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED AND HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD COME FORWARD- TOO WAS ON MAN AND SOME OF THESE MEASURES AND WE GO FORWARD. AS WE SEE THEY BEGIN TO IMPACT. ARE SOME OF THE STANDARDS THAT HAVE COME FROM THE URBAN LAND INSTITUTE OVER MANY MANY YEARS THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN. DISCUSSED AND IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE RESPECTING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES IMPACTS THAT DO PUT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES IN DANGER AND CERTAINLY OUT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO INHABIT.

MONTHS OF HARD WORK BY SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND SO MANY OTHERS WENT INTO THIS MOMENT BEFORE TALKING ABOUT THE BILL I WANT TO PAUSE FOR A MINUTE TO JUST SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE DEDICATION FOR THE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS FOR THE COURAGE TO SUPPORT A SOLUTION THAT WILL HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. THIS IS A BILL THAT PROVIDES OPTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS BY STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR THEM TO CREATE A DUPLEX OR SUBDIVIDE AN EXISTING LOT IN SINGLE FAMILY ZONES UP TO FOUR UNITS. I WANT TO DISCUSS SOME IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL THAT WERE ADDED WHILE IT WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY EARLIER THIS MONTH I ADDED AN AMENDMENT THAT STRENGTHENS THE OWNER OCCUPANCY PROVISION BY MAKING IT A STATEWIDE REQUIREMENT. TO ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS BENEFIT FROM THESE NEW HOUSING OPTIONS NOT CORPORATE INVESTORS. THE INTENT IS SIMPLE WE WANT TO PREVENT SPECULATION AND GENTRIFICATION IN ADDITION SP NINE NOW AUTHORIZES A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DENY A PROPOSED HOUSING PROJECT OR LOT SPLIT IF BUILDING OFFICIAL FINDS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY. OR THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT CANNOT BE MITIGATED FOR EXAMPLE IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN DOCUMENT A SPECIFIC FIRE HAZARD FOR A PARTICULAR PROJECT THEY COULD DENY IT IF THERE IS NO WAY TO AVOID THE EFFECT OF THE PROJECT. THIS AN IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT S. NINE STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING THE LOCAL CONTROL. AND CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE HOUSING OPTIONS WE NEED THOSE OPTIONS MORE THAN EVER TO HELP ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE. S. B. NINE IS THE CULMINATION OF YEARS OF HARD WORK AND COLLABORATION BY MANY ESPECIALLY ITS CO AUTHORS MY COLLEAGUES FROM SALINAS SAN JOSE LONG BEACH BALDWIN PARK SAN FRANCISCO. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST MY COLLEAGUE FROM HEALDSBURG. THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HOUSING LEAD GROUP OUR COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES RIVERSIDE AND BERKELEY ALSO SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO HELPING SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS WHO CHAMPION THIS BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY ALONG WITH SPEAKER RENDON. COLLEAGUES I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THIS BUT IT BEARS REPEATING ON THIS FLOOR. THIS BILL CAN HELP MAKE THAT DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP POSSIBLE. THIS BILL STANDS TO HELP MAKE COMMUNITIES MORE INCLUSIVE. AND IT STANDS TO SET THE STATE UP ON A PATH WHERE THERE ARE MORE HOUSING OPTIONS MORE SUPPLY AND MORE ACCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK. SINGER ACTOR CAN SWITCH LIKE TO CLOSE- I'M SORRY I'M SORRY SECONDS HANG ON ONE SECOND SENATE RATES YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MOM MR PRESIDENT A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND I BELIEVE I POSE THIS TO- THE GOOD SENATOR FROM- FROM HIM FROM SAN DIEGO AND WE CAN'T WHEN IT CAME THROUGH THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND THAT IS WHETHER IT'S A FAX. OF THE H. AWAY IS A COMMUNITY- INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS ACTUALLY PART OF THE RECORD. AND CAN IT BE BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR A LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY'VE BEEN RESET. LET ME THE MASS INTERACTIONS OF SHOVELING TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS CENTER SECONDS YES OF COURSE OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR AGAIN ARE WE HAVE MANY COMMUNITIES AND- YOU KNOW ORANGE COUNTY THAT WERE REQUIRED TO SET UP A HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS BACK IN THE EIGHTIES- TO COVER THE COST OF THE MUNICIPAL- MAINTENANCE BECAUSE THE COUNTY WAS NOT ABLE TO DO IT AT THAT TIME SO. THE QUESTION IS COULD YOU REPEAT FOR THE RECORD WHETHER OR NOT THIS INCLUDES OUR EXCLUSIVE OF COMMUNITY INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS AND HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS WITH CC IN OURS. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR- FOR THE QUESTION- AND- HI AS WE'VE INDICATED ON THE RECORD HERE CERTAINLY- WHEN IT WAS ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE BEFORE. FIVE IT IS SILENT ON THE ISSUE MEETING THE BILL CONTAINS NO PROVISIONS WOULD SUPERSEDES AN H. AWAY OR CID GOVERNING DOCUMENT- AS WE'VE SEEN WITH OTHER HOUSING LEGISLATION SB NINE WOULD HAVE TO CONTAIN EXPLICIT AND PROACTIVE PROVISION TO OVERRIDE HOAS AND SEE ID'S THAT WOULD PROHIBIT. SP NOT PROJECTS FURTHER- THERE WILL BE A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL- TO FURTHER PUT THAT ON THE RECORD- SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MR PRESIDENT THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO RESPOND. SERIK INSTINCT YOU CENTER BASED. WITH YOU I SPRAY MY HERE LET ME OPPOSE I HAVE. ON PIECE. OF OPPOSITION TO THIS- THAT KIND OF. MOST OF THE CITIES THAT WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES SITTING ON THIS FOR. A WHILE BEING CONTACTED AND ANSWER SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS. ARE TOO THESE ARE. PARTICULAR HOUSING BILLS AGAIN OR THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH PARKING ISSUES AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME. RATHER LOOSE OUR RESTRICTIONS I WOULD CONSIDER THEM LOSE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SPECIFIC FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TERMS OF- PROHIBITING AID. ON THE- CONSTRUCTION OF A PROBLEM THAN EIGHTY U. OR DUPLEX. FIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT IN TRANSIT RICH AREAS BUT STILL. THOSE WILL BE BATTLES THAT ARE FOUGHT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND CREATE CHAOS IN CERTAINLY- THESE ARE THINGS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO SO. I WILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO HANDLE JUST NOTE AGAIN. THERE ARE FOUR PAGES SINGLE SPACED HERE. OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS THE CITY'S REPRESENTED BY CITY COUNCILS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE RAISED OPPOSITION ON THESE VERY POINTS THAT CONTINUE TO BE IGNORED. HI. G. STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES IS THERE ANY OTHER DISK OR THE ON ITEM. SANDERS CAN. MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I STAND STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS CLAIMS ABOUT THAT WE ARE GOING TO ADD TO OUR FIRE CRISIS DUE TO THIS BUT AS THE AUTHOR JUST DESCRIBED THE- WHAT WAS BUILT INTO THE BILL TO DEAL WITH THAT FOR THOSE THAT- THOSE- HOUSING UNITS IN OUR MOVIES AND I THINK THAT YES CLEARLY OUR STATE IS A HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONE HOWEVER OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS KILLING AT LEAST AS MANY PEOPLE AS OUR FIRES WITH THE- THE LEVEL OF HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE. AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING DRIVEN OUT OF OUR STATE BECAUSE OF THE COST OF HOUSING AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY ACTIONS WE NEED TO TAKE TO ADDRESS IT AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR A VOTE THANK YOU SENT SENATOR SKINNER SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I JUST WANT TO STAND HERE ALSO STRONG SUPPORT IN A PROPER CLOTH- AND I WANTED TO SHARE THAT- I'VE BEEN HERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL. HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST AWFUL CONSENSUS BUILDING BILLS THAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR I REALLY DID BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. TO REALLY ANALYZE THE NEEDS AND HAS A LOCAL. FORMER COUNCILMEMBER I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THEIR LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBERS BUT- I WANT EVERYONE TO BE REST ASSURED THAT IT WAS THOUGHTFUL. WE BROUGHT ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. EVERYTHING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP. AND I THINK THAT THIS WAS A GOOD BALANCE OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. BUT AT THE END WE DO NEED HOUSING AND SO I START HAVING STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO MEMBERS IS THERE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES KNOW VERY WELL THAT THIS HAS TRAVELED A LONG ROAD WITH MANY AMENDMENTS. WITH MANY- DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO BALANCE AND SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME. AKE CARE OF THE BROADEST ISSUE THAT FACES OUR STATE ONE OF THE BROADEST IT'S NOT THE ONLY OF COURSE WE HAVE OTHER CRITICAL ISSUES. BUT THE LACK OF HOUSING STOCK THE LACK OF HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE. HELLO THE LACK OF HOUSING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY OWN A HOME IN THIS GREAT STATE HAS BEEN A DISCUSSION. I KNOW THAT REASONABLE MINDS CAN DISAGREE I AM INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE BROUGHT ON BOARD. MANY WITH CONDITIONS AND DIALOGUE AND CHANGES. TO THIS BILL. I AM PROUD OF THE WORK EFFORT EFFORT I AM PROUD OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUPPORTED IT I HAVE LISTENED.

CENTER COME ON THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE I RISE TO PRESENT AB TWELVE OH THREE IT IS A DISTRICT BILL SPONSORED BY THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THAT WILL ENABLE TAXPAYERS TO DISPUTE PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS. IN A TIMELIER MANNER SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL EXPAND THE POOL OF POTENTIAL APPLICANTS FOR SERVICE ON AN ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD IN LA COUNTY. ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD PERMIT THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO REDUCE THE THREE YEAR WAITING PERIOD WHICH FORMER ASSESSOR EMPLOYEES ARE SUBJECT TO BEFORE BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO SERVE. ON AN APPEALS BOARD TO NO LESS THAN ONE YEAR THE COUNTY IS FACING A CASELOAD OF OVER FORTY THOUSAND APPEALS A TOTAL THAT WAS EXACERBATED BY THE CLOSURES BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC. IN THE BACKLOG IS EXPECTED TO KEEP TRENDING UPWARD WITH MANY RETAILERS EXPECTED TO FILE DUE TO A PANDEMIC FEEL DECLINE IN PROPERTY VALUES THIS MEASURE BUILDS UPON EFFORTS FROM LAST SESSION WHERE WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOARD. TO ADDRESS INCREASING WORKLOADS AND PASSED LEGISLATION THAT REMOVES THE CAP IN STATE LAW ON THE NUMBER OF ASSESSMENT APPEAL BOARDS IN A COUNTY. THIS IS A LOW COST STRAIGHT FORWARD AND NECESSARY MEASURES THAT WILL HELP THE COUNTY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE TIME IN WHICH TAXPAYERS APPEALS ARE HEARD IT IS SUPPORTED.

HIGHS THIRTY ONE KNOWS SIX MAJOR PASSES WERE MOVING ON TO FIGHT HIM TO- THREE SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR SOME THE MEMBER MAZE SECRETARY PLEASE READ SOMEBODY FELL FOR TWENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAZE AT AN ACT RELATING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CENTERS FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT- THIS BILL. WOULD REQUIRE- WHERE TERM LIMITS ARE IMPOSED. TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF NO FEWER THAN TWO TERMS FOR COUNTY SUPERVISORS ARE- SPECIFIES THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. INCLUDED THE DEFINITION OF COUNTY OFFICERS FOR WHOM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REQUIRED TO PRESCRIBE COMPENSATION THE BILL WOULD SPECIFICALLY SPECIFY TO ME WOULD SPECIFY. THAT YOU WOULD NOT AFFECT ANY TERM LIMITS THAT WERE LEGALLY IN EFFECT PRIOR TO JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN ANY COUNTY S. RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR GORGEOUS. PRESIDENT. WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I TRY TO PUT FORWARD. TERM LIMITS. AT THE TIME I THOUGHT THAT. THREE TERMS WHICH WOULD BE A TOTAL OF FOUR YEARS- FOR- YOUR TERM SENSE THREE B. TOTAL TWELVE YEARS WOULD BE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIMETO DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK AND SO I THINK THERE IS A BALANCE BETWEEN TERM LIMITS THAT ARE PUNITIVE. AND TERM LIMITS THAT I THINK ARE EFFECTIVE WHILE STILL ENCOURAGING GOOD PEOPLE TO LEARN AND BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE AS TIME GOES ON. THE IDEA OF HAVING ONE TERM. THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE FOR ME MORE FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT WHERE YOU WANT TO RESPECT. THE WILL OF THE LOCAL CONSTITUENCY THE LOCAL ELECTORATE THAT VOTED IN THIS WAY. BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THE EFFICACY OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD FUNCTION. EFFECTIVELY BY LIMITING IT TO A SINGLE TERM. I THINK WE HAVE SEEN IT EXPERIMENTATION IS ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND I THINK ONE TERM IS JUST SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TO DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS AND EXPECT INDIVIDUALS- TO BE ABLE TO LEARN THE INSTRUMENTALITY IN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF GOVERNMENT. AND IT'S HARD WHEN THE LOCAL ELECTORATE ONE CITY IN ONE SPECIFIC WAY BY VIRTUE OF A BALLOT INITIATIVE. BUT IT ALL ENDS THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I RESPECT BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. I WOULD HAVE TO- CONFIRM MY SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU JUST SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW GOVERNMENT TO FUNCTION. WITH THAT LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME IN SERVICE. THANK YOU SIR BARGES CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT HOW WAS IT GONNA RISE AND SPEAK AGAINST THIS BILL INTO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO BROUGHT IT UP AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT MEASURE K. PASSED BY DECEMBER TO DINO CITIZENS THAT VOTED. TO DO SUPERVISOR- LIMITS TERM LIMITS AND ALSO SALARIES THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DIDN'T LIKE THAT AND THEY FILED A LAWSUIT BUT THEY LOST AND- SO NOW THIS BILL'S GOING TO THE BUILDING TO CIRCUMVENT AGAIN THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY HAVE MADE THEIR VOICE CLEAR THAT THEY WANT TO LIMIT TERM LIMITS FOR SUPERVISORS AND- THE SALARIES SORRY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. SENATOR LEVIN. THANK OU I MISS PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AS YOU HEARD MY COLLEAGUE SAY MAJOR K. WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT I DON'T LIKE MAJOR K. I DIDN'T LIKE MAJOR K. THERE WAS A COMPETING BALLOT MEASURE MEASURE H. WHICH I SUPPORTED AND WORKED FOR BUT MAJOR K. PAST I THINK THAT IT HARMS THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS IN MY COUNTY OF SAMBAR DINO BY LIMITING A TERM LIMITS TO ONE TERM LIMIT. NO BENEFITS NO PENSION SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR I THINK WE'LL HAVE A ROTATING GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER REALLY FULLY DO THE JOB OF THE PEOPLE IN SEMINOLE COUNTY BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT MATTERS IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF SAN MARINO COUNTY VOTED TO UPHOLD MEASURE KAY AND IS NOT OUR JOB TO OVERTURN THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IT REMINDS ME A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GEORGIA. WELL DON'T LIKE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE VOTED IN GEORGIA SO THEY'RE CHANGING THE LAWS THAT WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE IT IS NOT OUR JOB HERE IN SACRAMENTO. TO DO AS I SAID IN COMMITTEE A WORKAROUND OF WHAT THE CITIZENS WANT SO I RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE A PROPOSITION PROBLEM HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS OVERLY USED. BUT WHEN PEOPLE VOTE THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN. THANK YOU CENTER LABOR SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT JUST PERHAPS A GROWING FASTER WE DON'T ASK QUESTIONS BUT LET ME ASK A QUESTION OF THE FOUR JACKIE DOES THIS THING HURTS BERG WOULD YOU TAKE A QUESTION COURSE THANK YOU THANK YOU CETERA DOES THIS- DOES THIS MEASURE IMPACT THE ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN BY THE VOTERS. OF SAMBAR DINO COUNTY THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE NOW. SO THIS WOULD ONLY IMPACT. SITUATIONS IN OTHER COUNTIES WHERE CONSTITUENTS OR VOTERS MIGHT CHOOSE TO PUT ONE OF THESE MEASURES ON THE BALLOT THIS MEASURE WAS AMENDED SENATOR IT SAYS SPECIFICALLY ON PAGE TWO LINES TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY FOUR THE CHANGES MADE TO THE SUBDIVISION BY THIS ACT. THAT ADDED THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT AFFECT ANY TERM LIMITS THAT WE LEGALLY AFFECT CARTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO RESPECT TO THE MEASURES WE COUNTED IT WOULD DISCUSS THE SPELL IS BEEN SPECIFICALLY AMENDED SO AS TO NOT AFFECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AS WAS EXPRESSED. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. PLEASE ENTER THE CENTER UP ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. THE- LABOR- IF I MAY- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS ONLY FIXED TERM LIMITS IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T AFFECT HEY OR ANY OF THOSE ISSUES. YEAH THE LANGUAGE SAYS I DON'T GOOD QUESTION DID THE LANGUAGE SAYS TERM LIMITS SHOWED THEY WERE LEGALLY IN EFFECT PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE SO DOES NOT EXPRESS ANY OTHER. RESTRICTIVE MEASURE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT I DON'T MISS U. K. LIMITED SALARY AND OTHER THINGS LIKE PROP ONE FORTY DID WITH RESPECT TO THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. BUT THE POINT IS THAT- THE KEY THING IS THIS ONLY DEALS WITH TERM LIMITS IT ONLY TALKS ABOUT TERM LIMITS AND I DON'T THINK IN ANY WAY WITH OTHERWISE AFFECT ANYTHING ELSE THAT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS MIGHT OTHERWISE DONE. IS NOT ADDRESSED CORRECTLY SINCE EIGHTY EIGHT SO I JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR THAT FOLKS KNOW IT'S AFFECTING TERM LIMITS THE ONLY OTHER ONLY BUT THE OTHER THINGS THAT MAJOR K. DID COULD BE CHANGED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE OR QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR. DEBATE CENTER GORGEOUS.

ASSEMBLY BILL THREE SIXTY NINE BY SENATOR KEN LONGER AN ACT RELATING TO MEDICAL CENTER COLOR. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RISE TO ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS ON AB THREE SIX NINE THE STREET MEDICINE ACT WHICH EXPANDS ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THERE ARE MORE THAN SIXTY SIX THOUSAND HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS IN LA COUNTY A 13% JUMP FROM TWENTY NINETEEN THAT'S MORE THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE COUNTRY. BUT LA IS NOT THE ONLY COUNTY SUFFERING FROM THIS CRISIS THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE ARE NOT MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND AS A RESULT WE ARE ALL PAYING THE PRICE. DURING THE COURSE OF WORKING ON THIS BILL I'VE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF TOURING WITH A NUMBER OF STREET MEDICINE TEAMS I HAVE GONE OUT INTO THE STREETS AND I HAVE SEEN HOW THEY ADMINISTER CARE. VISITS DAD WHO'S SERVED DEALING WITH HYPERTENSION AND IS A DIABETIC IF IT'S FATIMA WHO'S- NOT ONLY BLIND- AND HIV POSITIVE. BUT IN- DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIPS AND ALSO HOMELESS- TO LEWIS WHO'S SUFFERING FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AILMENTS- TO KIANA AND HER FAMILY WHO ARE LIVING IN A BROKEN DOWN SUV. I HAVE STRUGGLED TO GET HEALTH CARE THAT THEY TRUST. THIS BILL REALLY MEETS ALL OF THOSE FOLKS WHERE THEY ARE. AND INSTEAD OF ASKING THEM TO GO INTO A TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITY AND TO JUMP THROUGH SO MANY HOOPS THAT MAKE IT REALLY- HARD FOR THEM TO GET CARE- THIS MEETS THEM WHERE THEY ARE IN THE STREETS IN THE ENCAMPMENTS. ETCETERA MANY OF THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ARE INSURED THROUGH MEDI CAL HOWEVER EVEN WHILE INSURED 73% OF THEM HAVE NEVER SEEN A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. AND WHEN THEY DO THEY ARE TURNED AWAY BECAUSE OF BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS STARTING WITH THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS WITH IDENTIFICATION CARDS THAT ARE OFTENTIMES LOST OR STOLEN. WITH BEING UNABLE TO OR UNWILLING TO LEAVE THEIR BELONGINGS ON THESTREET IN ORDER TO GET TO THE FACILITY TO GET CARE. OR BEING SHAMED BECAUSE PERHAPS THE DOCTOR OR THE ADMINISTRATORS OR EVEN. FELLOW PATIENTS ARE NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN HAVING THEM IN THOSE FACILITIES. THE MAINSTREAM HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODELS DO NOT FIT THE REALITY OF THE STREETS AND SO IF WE ARE GOING TO REALLY HELP. THEN IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RE ENGINEER PORTIONS OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM TO MEET FOLKS WHERE THEY ARE. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE TWENTY FIVE PLUS STREET MEDICINE TEAMS ACROSS THIS STATE WHO ARE DOING JUST THAT. THE JEWS OF IT ALL IS THAT RECOGNIZING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF ON HOUSE POPULATIONS. THIS BILL WILL EXTEND MEDIC COW PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY TO THE HOMELESS IT WILL REMOVE ID CARD REQUIREMENTS FOR RECEIVING CARE. AND WILL ALLOW AND HOUSE PATIENTS TO RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL BENEFITS OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF A TRADITIONAL MEDICAL CLINIC. I pBIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN COMMITTEES AND ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE GROUP IN OPPOSITION BUT A LOT MORE IMPORTANT. I'M PROUD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY FOLKS WERE AND HOUSE WHO ARE LIVING IN CAMPS AND ON THE STREETS EVERY DAY AND WHEN THIS WAS HEARD ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WHEN IT PASSED OFF THE FLOOR WE WERE TOLD. THERE WAS AN ENCAMPMENT THAT WAS BEING ADMINISTERED STREET MEDICINE AND THEY ALL STOPPED AND CHEERED.
