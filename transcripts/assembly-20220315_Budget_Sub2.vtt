ESPECIALLY COMING AFTER COATED

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:24.175
WITH THAT YEARS OF CUTS AND

00:37:24.241 --> 00:37:25.376
PREDICTABILITY AS FAR AS WE WERE

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:27.612
HEADED- BUT WE DID HAVE. A

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:29.246
RECORD AMOUNT OF MONIES IN THE

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:31.248

ENROLLMENT INVESTMENT WHICH WILL

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.288
GET TO. THAT'S WHY THIS IS GOING

00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:39.690
TO TALK ABOUT HERE IS A BIT OF

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:40.324
DISAPPOINTMENT LEGISLATURE THAT.

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.994
THAT YOU SEE IS NOT- ABLE TO

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.929
FOLLOW THROUGH SO FAR ON THE

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:47.498
AGREEMENT WE MADE LAST YEAR. TO

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:49.200
INCREASE ENROLLMENT BY SEVEN

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:51.202
THOUSAND ROUGHLY NEW STUDENTS AT

00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:52.403
WINNER STAND THAT YOU SEE OVER

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.805
AND ROLLED- STUDENTS- TWO YEARS

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:56.674
AGO AND IT TOOK ROUGHLY TWO

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:57.742
YEARS TO COUNT HOW MANY THEY

00:37:57.808 --> 00:37:59.844
ACTUALLY HAD THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.579
WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT THAT AND I CAN

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:03.414
WE TALK ABOUT IT LATER BUT WE DO

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:04.882
SUPPORT FULLY FUNDING. EVER

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.250
STUDENT SHOWS UP BUT YOU SEE

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:09.086
LIKE WE DO AT OUR K. TWELVE

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.521
SYSTEM I THINK THERE IS THIS.

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:12.023
PROBLEM WE'VE HAD AFTER THE

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:13.824
RECESSION WE'RE- YOU KNOW IN K.

00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:14.959
TWELVE SCHOOLS YOU KNOW YOU YOU

00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:17.094
YOU FIND HIS THEIR WHO SHOWS UP

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.029
AND THEN YOU SEE WE HAVEN'T

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:19.997
ALWAYS. HAD IT LIKE THAT FOR UC

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.298
AND CSU SO I THINK THAT WE

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:23.100
SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:25.169
FIXING THAT ISSUE. SO WE CAN

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:26.837
HAVE A TRUE UP AFTER THE YEAR TO

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:28.572
MAKE SURE WE FIND ACTUAL.

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:29.640
ENROLLMENT AT THE UC. BUT AGAIN

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:31.909
IT IS- DISAPPOINTING THAT- THE

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.511

GONNA START THIS FALL. AND NOW

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.287
THAT IS IN QUESTION SO WE WANT

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:44.955
TO GET TO THE CRUX. AT AND

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.991
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MOVE

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.259
FORWARD- WE DID FIND THOSE-

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:50.294
SLOTS IN THIS IN THIS BUDGET SO

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:51.228

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:54.198

BIT LOWER IT SHOWS ENROLLMENT OF

TARGETED ROMAN IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:03.487
TWENTY ONE. SO THE QUESTION FOR

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:05.489
LEGISLATORS HOW TO RESPOND TO

THESE ISSUES AND- WITH A FEW

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.860
RECOMMENDATIONS HERE. ONE IS TO

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:13.297
TREAT UC'S PLANTED ROMAN LEVEL

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:16.133

IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:19.570
THREE. THE REASON FOR THIS IS

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:21.572
BECAUSE YOU SEE IT IS CURRENTLY

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.474
MAKING FALL ADMISSION DECISIONS

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.341
BY THE TIME THE BUDGET IS

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:27.478
ENACTED IT WILL HELP ONCE WE

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:28.012
FINALIZE THOSE POLITICIAN

00:42:28.078 --> 00:42:29.313
DECISIONS. I'M ALSO LOOKING

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.081
LIKELY WILL BE SORT OF THE

00:42:31.148 --> 00:42:31.982
BASELINE THAT UC'S WORKING OFF

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:35.619
OF FOR RESIDENT. MOMENTS IF YOU

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.221
WERE TO TREAT THAT THEY- AS A AS

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:39.590
THE BASIS FOR FUNDING THAT

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:40.224
FOURTEEN HUNDRED STUDENT GROWTH

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:42.826
ESTIMATE WOULD COME TO ABOUT

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.061
THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS.

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:45.562

YOU SEE PROVIDED THIS THIRTY

00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:54.972
SEVEN MILLION REFLECTS THE

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:59.276
UPDATED INFORMATION. ON THE- NOW

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:00.911
THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:03.647
ADDITIONAL FUNDING ABOVE- THAT

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:04.915
THIRTY SEVEN MILLION UP TO THE

00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:07.151
ENTIRE NINETY NINE MILLION

00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:09.420
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR- DOING

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:11.088
SO WOULD EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE

BETWEEN US. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:59:17.186 --> 00:59:19.489
QUESTION SIR- BRIDGING THE GAP

00:59:19.555 --> 00:59:22.025
FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO MAY

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:24.394
NOT BE FULLY POSSIBLE. BECAUSE

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.496
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HIRE

00:59:26.562 --> 00:59:29.899
ENOUGH INSTRUCTORS TO TEACH SIX

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:32.468
THOUSAND STUDENTS. ARE AT BUT WE

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:34.804
DO HAVE ENOUGH APPLICANTS INTO

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:37.874
THE UC SYSTEM TO INCREASE OUR

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:42.078
ADMISSIONS BEYOND THE- OF TWO

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:44.414
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THAT I

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.949
ALREADY DISCUSSED. OF CLOSE THE

00:59:46.015 --> 00:59:47.383
BUDGET HAS NOT YET BEEN

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.852
FINALIZED AND UNIVERSITY DOESN'T

00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:51.587
YET HAVE THAT INVOLVEMENT

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:53.623
FUNDING. WE CAN'T START HIRING

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.358
FACULTY BECAUSE WE HAVE NO

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:57.226
FUNDING TO BRING THEM ON BOARD

00:59:57.293 --> 01:00:00.496
UNTIL- JULY FIRST WHEN THE

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:02.832
BUDGET WILL BECOME LAW. SO

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.701
BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE UNABLE TO

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.236
START THE HIRING PROCESS FOR THE

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:09.005
FACULTY THAT WE WOULD NEED FOR

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:11.908
THE SIX THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS-

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:14.544
WE MAY BE ABLE TO I KNOW WE CAN

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.512
IN ROLE THAT MANY STUDENTS OVER

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:18.214
THREE YEARS. AND THERE MAY BE

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.517
WAYS TO ACCELERATE IT TO TWO

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:24.687
YEARS. YES THAT'S A GOOD POINT

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:25.355
SO I KNOW THERE'S DEBATE AND LA

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:26.622
I WAS SAYING WE SHOULDN'T GIVE

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:29.092
YOU ALL THE MONEY FOR THAN SIXTY

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:30.493
TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS BECAUSE

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.127
YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING ON

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:34.197
ROLE THEN- IF WE DID KEEP IT IN

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.598
THERE WHAT WHAT WITH THE

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.000
COMMITMENT BE THAT YOU'D BE ABLE

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.534
TO HAVE THEM. THE FOLLOWING YEAR

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.870
SO THE- TWENTY TWENTY THREE YOU

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:42.905
SEE YOU YOU WOULD HAVE THE MONEY

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:45.308
THERE JULY ONE- AND FRANKLY WE

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.376
THINK YOU COULD HAVE STARTED

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:48.177
MAKING THE HIRING DECISIONS IN

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.846
THE SPRING YOU GET THE MONEY A

BUT WE- KIND OF. WE CROSS THAT.

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:55.318
BRIDGE SO WE CAN'T GO BACK HERE.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:56.919
SO WHAT TYPE OF COMMITMENT WILL

01:00:56.986 --> 01:01:00.089
BE HAVE FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:02.058

WE'RE WE ARE WE ARE WILLING TO

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.333
REVERSE THE DECISION THAT WAS

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.502
MADE. DURING THE RECESSION.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.170
WHERE WE DON'T TRUE UP AFTER THE

YEAR TO FULLY FUND. MINISTERED

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:26.909
AS A SALAD BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:29.345
ART ON ADMISSIONS WHO ACTUALLY

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:32.014

WE WOULD RATHER YOU KNOW ERR ON

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.918
THE SIDE OF. OF HAVING MORE

STUDENTS AND PAPERS TO ANSWER

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:43.559

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:45.928
TOGETHER. TO DO WHAT YOU'RE

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:48.064
SAYING WHICH IS FUNDS THAT THE

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:50.133
SPIKE THAT YOU GOT DURING THE

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:51.134
KOBE LAST TWO YEARS I KNOW IT

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.969
WAS HARD YOU CAN PREDICT TWO

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.804
SHOWING UP AND ADMISSIONS AND

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:57.440
ENROLLMENT IS THAT. AGAIN AN ART

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.041
NOT A SCIENCE YOU NOT ALWAYS

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.710
CERTAINLY PRECISE IT TOOK. TWO

01:03:00.776 --> 01:03:02.311
YEARS TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.247
MATHEMATICAL ERRORS WHICH IS YOU

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.448
KNOW THE PROBLEM WARRANT TODAY

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.049
ITSELF THAT'S ON YOUR ALL AND

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:09.218
BUT WE UNDERSTAND IF. WE GET THE

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:10.887
GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:13.022
ON THESE CAMPUSES SO YES. SO HOW

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:15.625
CAN WE FULLY FUND THOSE AND GET

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:19.028
THE SEVEN THOUSAND THAT WE- HAD

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:21.297
OUR DESIRE TO. WHAT DO WE NEED

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:23.199
TO DO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:26.068
AT. THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS THAT

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.437
ARE IN THERE TODAY. AND THE

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:29.906
SEVEN THOUSAND BY THE FALL OF

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.407
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WHAT IS TO

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:35.077
HAPPEN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.080
ABOUT THAT WOULD BE- THAT WOULD

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:40.950
BE A LOT OF EXERCISE DO THAT SO

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.618
EACH ONE THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:46.589
WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY- ELEVEN

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.457
POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:51.494
THE UC SYSTEM TO TAKE ON- AND

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:54.564
SINCE WE'RE PROPOSING TO TAKE ON

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.766
TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:57.700
THREE AND TWO THOUSAND SIX

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:59.936
HUNDRED. AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:05.408
TWO- THAT IT'S GOT US TO FOUR

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.076
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SO THE

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:07.710
ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WOULD NEED

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.178
TO BE FUNDED FROM ADDITIONAL

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:11.414
FUNDS I GET THAT BUT AGAIN FORTY

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.281
SIX HUNDRED IS WAY LESS THAN

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:15.051
THAT. SEVEN THOUSAND THAT WE DID

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:16.419
AND THESE PRESS RELEASES ON LAST

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.521
SUMMER TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE ARE

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:19.956
GOING TO DO IN THE INTERIM

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.057
YOU'RE SAYING OH BY THE WAY

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:23.426
CALIFORNIA WE OVER AND ROLL

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:24.427
THESE OTHER STUDENTS WE NEED TO

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:25.962
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND SO.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:27.296
WE'RE SAYING WE'RE WE AGREE WITH

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:29.432
THAT WE ARE GOING TO WORK TO

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:30.866
FULLY FUND THE NUMBER OF

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:32.568
STUDENTS YOU HAVE TO KIND OF

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:34.470
LIKE A TRUE UP AFTER THE YEAR

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.038
HOW MANY WE HAVE WILL FULLY FUND

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:37.073
THE MARGINAL COST THOSE ACTUAL

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:38.441
STUDENTS. BUT WE STILL WANT TO

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:40.743
NOT LOSE SIGHT ON. THE HIGHER

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.445
NUMBER AND WHY DOES THIS MATTER

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:44.347
BECAUSE IT GOES BACK TO YOUR

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:47.450
STATEMENT ABOUT THE RECORD

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:49.418
NUMBER OF APPLICANTS. IS BACK

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:50.620
THE FACT THAT. EMPLOYERS ACROSS

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:52.154
CALIFORNIA SAY MANY MORE COLLEGE

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:54.156
GRADUATES FOR TO FILL THE JOBS

OF TODAY AND TOMORROW- YOU KNOW

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:58.261

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.506
NORTH OF TWENTY THOUSAND WHAT

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:15.010
ARE SOME OF THAT CONSTRAINTS TO

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:18.280
SUCH. A GOAL TODAY. TODAY THE

OF ACADEMIC SPACE ON THE

CAMPUSES AND THE FACT THAT IT

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:27.389
TAKES ABOUT THREE YEARS TO

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:28.123
CONSTRUCT A NEW ACADEMIC

THE STATE. THROUGH A FUNDING

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:43.084
MECHANISM YET TO BE DETERMINED.

IS THIS BRINGS UP AN IMPORTANT

01:23:58.266 --> 01:23:59.067
POINT SHARING'S IMPORTANT POINT

EXPERIENCE WITH THE UC EVERY UC

01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:03.371
CAMPUS TRIES CAN OPERATE IN ITS

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:05.039
OWN KINGDOM AND CREATE THEIR OWN

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:07.709
ALLERGY PEAS SO HOW AND THAT

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:09.778
REALLY GENERATES THEIR LONG TERM

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:11.346
EFFICIENCY OF HOW MANY SINCE

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:12.247

ACADEMIC SPACE THEY CAN HAVE

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:15.650

COORDINATING THAT KIND OF GROWTH

01:24:40.975 --> 01:24:42.277
STRATEGY AN OLDER ALREADY PEAS

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:43.945
ARE YOU LETTING EACH INDIVIDUAL

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.247
CAMPUS PUSH ON THEIR OWN. AND

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.450
FIGURING OUT THAT WAY SO IS IT

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:50.718
LIKE A TOP DOWN SYSTEM OR A

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.253
BOTTOM UP SYSTEM RIGHT NOW.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.455
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

ASSEMBLY MEMBER CURRENTLY IT IS

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:58.026
A BIT MORE OF A BOTTOM UP.

01:24:58.092 --> 01:25:00.028
SYSTEM WHERE EACH CAMPUS

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:01.463
DEVELOPS THEIR LONG RANGE

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:02.864
DEVELOPMENT PLAN. IN

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.666
COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:06.234
WHERE THEY ARE BASED. AND

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:07.602
LOOKING AT WHAT THE

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:09.304
POSSIBILITIES ARE FOR THAT

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.272
CAMPUS AND HOW THEY WANT TO GROW

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:14.976
AND DEVELOP- ANNUALLY. THE UC

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:16.578
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WORKS

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:18.279
WITH THE ADMISSIONS OFFICERS UP

01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:20.582
EVERY CAMPUS. THE FIRST ASK THEM

01:25:20.648 --> 01:25:22.417
HOW MANY STUDENTS THEY WANT TO

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.152
ENROLL AND THEN- FOR FALLING

01:25:24.219 --> 01:25:26.654
SHORT OF THE LEGISLATIVELY SET

01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:28.690
GOALS. WE WORK WITH THE CAMPUS

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:30.258
IS TO HAVE THEM INCREASE THOSE

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:32.527
NUMBERS TO. SEE WHO COULD TAKE

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:34.295
ON ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT BUT

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:36.664
FIRST WE ALLOWED THE CAMPUS AS-

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.800
THEY TRY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:40.768
THEMSELVES. AND SEE IF IT THEN

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:42.470
ALIGNS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:43.938
GOALS. AND I DEFINITELY

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:45.440
UNDERSTAND EVERY CAMPUS AND

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:47.141
COMMUNITY EMBEDDED HAS OUR OWN

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:49.244
INDIVIDUAL WANTS AND NEEDS BUT I

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.211
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN

01:25:50.278 --> 01:25:51.079
OVER THE YEARS. WHY THERE'S

01:25:51.145 --> 01:25:53.147
DIFFERENCE. NONRESIDENT ROMAN

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:53.982
THERE'S DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:55.049
HOUSING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:56.451
EVERYWHERE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:58.286
PURSUE WRITING A MORE CONSISTENT

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:00.188
STATEWIDE GOALS IS. GIVEN ALSO

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:01.256
THE MINISTRATION SEEMS TO HAVE

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:03.024
THAT AND I THINK YOU SEE SEEMS

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:04.893
TO WANT TO DO THAT SO I WOULD

01:26:04.959 --> 01:26:06.160
URGE HOPEFULLY WE CAN COORDINATE

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:08.062
WITH US AT A MORE HIGHER LEVEL.

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:09.664
AND FIGURE OUT ITS NOT YOU KNOW

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:11.032
US PRESSING DOWN AND THEN YOU

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:13.001
HAVE TO DO THIS BUT LIKE HOW CAN

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.369
WE SHOULD LIVE TOGETHER. RATHER

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:16.104
THAN YOU ALL INDIVIDUALLY SAY I

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:17.138
ONLY WANT THIS MUCH- I CAN ONLY

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:19.140
DO THIS MUCH. AND THAT

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:20.074
COORDINATION I THINK HAS

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:21.142
RESULTED IN A MORE SCATTERED

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:22.143
APPROACH TO ENROLLMENT AND I

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.411
THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:25.013
SOME OF THE STRUGGLES WE HAVE.

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:27.048
SO I HOPE THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:28.182
US THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY

01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:29.984
PRESS ON FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.386
COORDINATE THESE GOALS RATHER

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.554
THAN HAVING THE CULTURE OF A-

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.321
INDIVIDUAL KINGDOMS I'VE KNOWN

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:35.189
YOU SEE TO BE. SUFFICIENT BUT I

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:37.458
JUST WANT TO HARP ON THAT AS I

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:39.761
THINK RELATED TO THE POINT THAT

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:40.828
CHEN RICCARDI WAS MAKING SO.

01:26:40.895 --> 01:26:44.065

LEGISLATURE IN A BETTER POSITION

TO REVIEW HASTINGS BUDGET

02:09:40.539 --> 02:09:42.074
PROPOSAL THERE ARE TWO REASONS

02:09:42.141 --> 02:09:44.443
FOR THIS. ONE IS THAT THE

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:45.544
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BASED

02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:47.312
INCREASE IS CONNECTED TO A

02:09:47.379 --> 02:09:49.081
BUDGET PLAN THAT HASTINGS

02:09:49.148 --> 02:09:51.450
DEVELOPED. BUDGET PLAN INCLUDES

02:09:51.517 --> 02:09:53.752
SIR BASIC WORKLOAD INCREASES

LIKE SALARY INCREASES BENEFIT

02:09:55.754 --> 02:09:58.056
COST INCREASES THINGS ALSO PLANS

TO HIRE US ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES

02:10:00.325 --> 02:10:03.095
AND REPLACE SOME RICH BY PLAY

02:10:03.162 --> 02:10:05.230
REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN IN

02:10:05.297 --> 02:10:06.498
ADDITION HASTINGS ANNUALLY

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:08.000

02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:11.904
LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE SENSE AS

02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:13.172
TO WHERE IT'S HEADING. THE

02:10:13.238 --> 02:10:15.007
NATIONAL AND IT'S NOT A CONTRACT

02:10:15.073 --> 02:10:16.008
SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING

02:10:16.074 --> 02:10:18.443
LEGISLATURE IS BEING ASKED TO

02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:20.012
COMMIT TO TODAY. I'M SO FOR

02:10:20.078 --> 02:10:21.413
THOSE REASONS WE THINK THE

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.748
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- PROVIDES A

02:10:22.814 --> 02:10:24.249
REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:25.684
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IN

02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:27.819

THE BUDGET YEAR. IT IS A

02:10:29.288 --> 02:10:30.322
STARTING POINT SO WE DO

02:10:30.389 --> 02:10:31.757
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:10:31.823 --> 02:10:33.392

02:10:33.458 --> 02:10:35.294

INITIATIVE TO CHANGE ITS NAME.

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:47.973
