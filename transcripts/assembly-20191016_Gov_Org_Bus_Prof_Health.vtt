THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE. IN

AS A STAR AS A STARTING POINT

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.763
SO. I JUST WHAT I'LL BE BRIEF I

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.331
REALLY WANT TO HEAR FROM OUR

00:32:46.397 --> 00:32:47.532
EXPERTS THIS AFTERNOON. BUT YOU

00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:48.900
HAVE SOME COMMENTS I THINK THE

00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:49.534
EXPLOSION OF POPULARITY OF THE

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.002
CIGARETTES HERE AT THE

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:51.536
CIGARETTE USE HAS BEEN A

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:53.771
PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME. WAS

00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:55.273
STAGGERING NUMBERS OF YOUTH

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.208
BECOMING ADDICTED TO NICOTINE.

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:58.543
IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS HAS

00:32:58.609 --> 00:32:59.677
BECOME ALL TOO CLEAR THAT WE

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:00.978
HAVE A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM ON

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:02.613
OUR HANDS WITH THE OUTBREAK. OF

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.848
LONG ILLNESS AND INJURIES AND

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:05.950
DEATH AND THE QUESTIONS AROUND

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:08.553
EXACTLY WHAT'S CAUSING THIS. MY

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:09.487
COLLEAGUES AND I ARE COMMITTED

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:10.655
TO WORKING ON ALL ASPECTS OF

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:12.023
THIS ISSUE AND BUYS AS YOU'VE

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.291
HEARD THIS HEARING IS JUST A

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:16.728
FIRST STEP. I BREAK THIS INTO

00:33:16.794 --> 00:33:17.929
TWO DIFFERENT IN MY MIND THE

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:22.066
WAY I LOOK AT THIS AND THERE

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:22.667
ARE MANY ASPECTS TO THIS I AM

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:25.937
CONCERNED ABOUT ONE. THE NUMBER

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.105
OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:28.005
STARTING TODAY. PERIOD WHETHER

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:30.441
IT'S- NICOTINE OR THC. NUMBER

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:32.210
TWO. THE ILLNESS THAT WERE

00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:33.611
FACING THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:35.213
THAT WE'RE FACING THERE AND SO

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.081
I THINK. AS WE START HEARING

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:39.450
ABOUT THIS. I THINK THOSE ARE

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:42.353
SEPARATE ISSUES IN MANY WAYS

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.921
THERE IS SOME CROSS OVER BUT-

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:46.124
THAT'S HOW MY- MY- WEIRD

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.592
COMPARTMENTALIZED MIND WORKS.

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:50.695
SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO

00:33:50.762 --> 00:33:53.664
INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANEL. SO I

00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:55.466

INFORMATION ABOUT UNDERSTANDING

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.538
THE NEW VAPING EPIDEMIC FOR

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:35.840
CALIFORNIA. THE WORD EPIDEMIC

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.141
HAS BEEN USED FOR YEARS TO

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:38.976
DESCRIBE HOW TOBACCO IS THE

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.445
LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF

00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:42.280
DEATH NOW THE WORD EPIDEMIC IS

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:44.015
BEING USED FOR VAPING WITH THE

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:45.883
SHARP RISE IN YOUTH RATES THE

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.118
MASSIVE PROLIFERATION OF

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:50.121
PRODUCTS AND SHOCKING NEW CASES

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:50.721
OF AVIAN ASSOCIATED PULMONARY

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:52.523
INJURY AND DEATHS FIRST I'LL

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.958
HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY POINTS FOR

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:54.992
THE REGULATORY HELP LANDSCAPE

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:58.996
NEXT MISS HOMER BACKDOOR WILL

00:34:59.063 --> 00:34:59.530
HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT AND-

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:04.001
YOUTH. AND YOUNG ADULTS. AT

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:04.635
THIS IS WHAT I CALL MY GREATEST

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:05.436
HITS LIKE. BUT LOOKING BACK

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:06.003
LESSONS FROM THE PAST ABOUT

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.537
MARKETING AND SCIENCE ARE

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:07.605
IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING

00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:10.308
WHAT IS GOING ON TODAY. SO IN

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:11.542
THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES WHEN

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:13.110
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT FIRST

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:14.111
STARTED LINKING SMOKING

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:15.680
CIGARETTES TO LUNG CANCER

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:16.981
EMERGED THE TOBACCO COMPANIES

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.883
STARTED RUNNING. THESE HISTORIC

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.718
ADVERTORIALS CALLED A FRANK

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.587
STATEMENT TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:23.187
TO CREATE DOUBT BY DISPUTING

00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:24.956
THE STUDY FINDINGS. SAYING

00:35:25.022 --> 00:35:26.357
EXPERIMENTS WITH MICE WERE NOT

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:28.326
REGARDED AS CONCLUSIVE FOR LUNG

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:30.094
CANCER THEY ALSO RAN ADS

00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:31.429
SHOWING DOCTORS HERE PROMOTING

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:33.731
PRODUCTS. THEY ALSO STATED THEY

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.766
BELIEVE THEIR PRODUCTS WERE NOT

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:37.368
INJURIOUS TO HEALTH AND THAT

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:38.002
THEY WOULD COOPERATE FOR PUBLIC

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:39.637
HEALTH. AND THEN GROWING OVER

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:41.405
TIME ALL THE SCIENTIFIC

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.640
EVIDENCE TEN YEARS LATER IT

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:44.408
TOOK THE FIRST SEARCH LANDMARK

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:47.245
CERTAIN GENERAL'S REPORT IN

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:47.712
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TO

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:49.514
SYMPATHIZE ALL THAT BIOLOGICAL.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:54.318
AND DEPUTY A LOGICAL EVIDENCE.

00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:54.886
CONCLUDING THAT SMOKING DOES

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:59.824
INDEED CAUSE LUNG CANCER.

00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:00.458
SUBSEQUENTLY THE U. S. CONGRESS

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:01.158
ADOPTED LAWS FOR HEALTH

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.360
WARNINGS ON CIGARETTE PACKAGES

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:02.927
IN ADVERTISING BANS IN THE

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:03.461
BROADCAST MEDIA. HOWEVER

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:04.228
TOBACCO CONTROL WORK CONTINUES

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:05.496
TODAY AT THE CENTERS FOR

00:36:05.563 --> 00:36:06.430
DISEASE CONTROL STATES DUE TO

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:07.598
THE QUOTE THE ADDICTIVE NATURE

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:09.600
OF TOBACCO. AND POWERFUL

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:10.201
ECONOMIC FORCES PROMOTING ITS

00:36:10.268 --> 00:36:14.539
USE. NOW IN THE SEVENTIES

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:15.306
EIGHTIES THE NEXT COUPLE

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:17.174
DECADES THE INDUSTRY STARTED

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:18.609
TRYING TO DEVELOP AND MARKET

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:20.311
NEW PRODUCTS AS LESS HARMFUL TO

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:22.113
SMOKERS. BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY

00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:23.814
THE EVIDENCE THAT NON SMOKERS

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:25.483
COULD ALSO BE HARMED THAT HAD

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.586
THE MOST IMPACT SAMPLES IN THE

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:29.153
ROOM MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ALIVE

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.922
DURING THIS TIME BUT- THAT

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:32.523
ADVERTISEMENT ON THE LEFT HAND

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.058
SIDE WITH THE DISCO LADY. SHOWS

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.193
THAT THE INDUSTRY SOLD LOW TAR

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.929
CIGARETTES MILD LIGHT ULTRA

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:38.896
LIGHT CIGARETTES ARE LESS

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.331
HARMFUL BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT

00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:42.366
TARA CAUSE CANCER WHEN IT WAS

00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:44.769
PAINTED ON THE BACKS OF MICE

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:45.570
MAYBE THIS WAS A WAY TO GET

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:47.471
LESS CANCER. HOWEVER THESE

00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:48.873
CIGARETTES WERE ALSO MACHINE

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.108
TESTED FOR LOWER LEVELS OF TAR

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:52.543
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.045
HAPPENED WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY

00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:56.347
USE THESE PRODUCTS. SO IT DID

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:58.149
NOT ACTUALLY REDUCE THE HEALTH

00:36:58.215 --> 00:36:58.816
RISKS OF SMOKING AND IT TOOK US

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:00.785
YEARS TO FIGURE THAT OUT. SO IN

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.219
REAL LIFE SMOKERS COULD CHANGE

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.354
THE WAY THEY SMOKE BECAUSE THEY

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:04.488
WERE TRYING TO GET A LOT MORE

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.857
NICOTINE AND THEY COULD

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:07.725
ACTUALLY GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:11.929
CHEMICALS OR EVEN MORE. THAN

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:12.430
THE MACHINE BASED NUMBER

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:18.269
SUGGESTED. SO AS- TIME WENT ON

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:19.437
IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES

00:37:19.503 --> 00:37:20.037
THE SURGEON GENERAL CAME OUT

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:20.638
WITH A REPORT ON. THE GROWING

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:21.238
AGAIN THE GROWING SCIENTIFIC

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:22.640
EVIDENCE THAT SECONDHAND SMOKE

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:24.742
EXPOSURE CAUSED HARM TO

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:26.310
NONSMOKERS AND IN FACT BECAUSE

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:28.779
LIKE CANCER. THIS EVIDENCE HELP

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:31.749
STIMULATE ABROAD RATE OF CHANGE

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.250
FROM. SOME OF YOU IN THE ROOM

00:37:33.317 --> 00:37:34.652
MAY REMEMBER NO SMOKING

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.220
SECTIONS WHICH PEOPLE JOKINGLY

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:37.388
SAY IT'S LIKE HAVING A NO

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:38.689
PEEING SECTION IN A POOL.

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:41.092
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK.

00:37:41.158 --> 00:37:42.793
TO NOW WHAT WE HAVE FOR SMOKE

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.061
FREE POLICIES THAT PROTECT

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:46.931
NONSMOKERS SO. IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:49.600
ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:50.201
NINETEEN NINETY NINE WITH OUR

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:51.736
FOR OUR FIRST TOBACCO TAXED.

00:37:51.802 --> 00:37:53.037
THAT WE CREATED A COMPREHENSIVE

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:54.805
TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAM TO

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:55.840
CHANGE SOCIAL NORMS AROUND

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:57.975
SMOKING. REDUCE PRODUCT

00:37:58.042 --> 00:37:59.043
AVAILABILITY AND PROTECT PUBLIC

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.345
HEALTH. INSTEAD OF ONLY

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:02.647
FOCUSING ON TREATING INDIVIDUAL

00:38:02.713 --> 00:38:04.281
SMOKERS ON THIS APPROACH HAS

00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:05.650
BEEN WIDELY RECOGNIZED

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:09.487
INTERNATIONALLY. AS ONE OF THE

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:10.087
GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESS

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:17.928
IS TO THIS DAY. NOW THE

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.030
NINETIES TO THE TWO THOUSAND

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:19.630
WERE MARKED BY LAWSUITS. UP

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:20.231
WHISTLE BLOWERS HELPED BRING

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:20.765

DOCUMENTS TO LIGHT THAT WERE

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:22.366
PREVIOUSLY PROTECTED THROUGH

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:23.067
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE.

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:23.567
THESE INTERNAL DOCUMENTS

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:24.835
DOCUMENTS WHEN STARK CONTRAST

00:38:24.902 --> 00:38:25.603
TO THE PICTURE IN THE UPPER

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.104
RIGHT OF WHERE THE TOBACCO

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:28.372
INDUSTRY CEOS AT THE TIME

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:31.108
TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF CONGRESS

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:31.642
I BELIEVE NICOTINE IS NOT

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:34.712
ADDICTIVE. SUBSEQUENTLY THE

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:35.312
STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S UP

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:36.313
SUIT FOR MEDICAID COSTS FOR

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.716
TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE LEADING

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:39.517
TO WHAT IS CALLED AS THE MASTER

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:41.519
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. AT THE

00:38:41.585 --> 00:38:43.688
FEDERAL LEVEL IN TWO THOUSAND

00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:44.422
SIX THE US DEPARTMENT OF

00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:45.856
JUSTICE RULED THAT THE INDUSTRY

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:47.525
VIOLATED THE RACKETEERING AND

00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:49.226
CORRUPT INFLUENCE ORGANIZATIONS

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:50.661
LAW CONCLUDING THAT INDUSTRY

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:52.830
QUOTE. CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.565
AND EXECUTE A FIFTY YEAR SCHEME

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:56.967
TO DEFRAUD THE PUBLIC ON HEALTH

00:38:57.034 --> 00:38:57.468
EFFECTS AND MARKETING TO

00:38:57.535 --> 00:39:01.672
CHILDREN. AND THEN FOR YEARS

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:02.273
AFTERWARDS THE INDUSTRY ARGUED

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:03.941
AGAINST FEDERAL PENALTIES AND

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:06.310
IT TOOK OVER A DECADE LATER IN

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:07.611
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEENTH FOR

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:10.114
THEM TO FINALLY ERIC QUOTE. OF

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:11.716
CONSTRUCTIVE COURT ORDERED

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:13.184
STATEMENTS WHICH SOME OF WHICH

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.152
ARE SEEN ON THE LOWER RIGHT.

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.387
AND SO THESE RAN KIND OF IN

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:18.289
LIKE MIKE TV'S BLACK AND WHITE

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:19.657
THERE'S YOU CAN STILL SEE SOME

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.826
OF THEM ON YOUTUBE. HOWEVER

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.294
STUDY SHOWED THAT ONLY 40% OF

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.963
US. ADULTS WERE ACTUALLY AWARE

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.566
OF THESE CORRECTIVE STATEMENTS

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:29.967
ABOUT THE RANGE OF WHAT THEY

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:32.203
HAD THE STATE INCLUDED IT

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:34.772
KNOWLEDGE MENTION THAT.

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:35.740
NICOTINE WAS INDEED ADDICTIVE

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:37.441
LOW TAR LIGHT ULTRALIGHT MILE

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:39.443
THE NATURAL CIGARETTES ACTUALLY

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.112
LACKED HEALTH BENEFITS AND WERE

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:42.246
DECEPTIVELY MARKETED AS LESS

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:44.482
HARMFUL. THE CIGARETTES FROM

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:45.716
MANIPULATED TO MAXIMIZE

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:50.121
NICOTINE DELIVERY. AND THAT

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:50.654
THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:54.592
EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE.

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:55.960
SO NOW WE COME TO THE FOOD AND

00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:57.461
DRUG ADMINISTRATION IN TWO

00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:58.062
THOUSAND NINE THEY WERE GIVEN

00:39:58.129 --> 00:39:58.662
AUTHORITY TO REGULATE TOBACCO

00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.230
PRODUCTS. THIS INCLUDED THE

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:01.732
MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTION AND

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:03.334
MARKETING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.902
THE FDA IS SUPPOSED TO APPROVE

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:06.604
THAT NEW PRODUCTS ARE NOT WORSE

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.105
THAN CIGARETTES BEFORE THEY GO

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:10.174
TO MARKET. THERE ALSO SUPPOSED

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:11.709
TO APPROVE ANY MARK PRODUCTS

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:12.910
MAKING CESSATION OR REDUCED

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:15.646
HARM CLAIMS. ARE GO THROUGH

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:17.782
THEIR OFFICE AS WELL AND

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:18.716
PRODUCTS LIKE JEWEL HAVE NOT

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:21.085
DONE FOR EXAMPLE. FLAVORS AND

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:22.319
CIGARETTES HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:24.488
BANNED THROUGH THIS REGULATION

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:27.758
EXCEPT FOR MENTAL CIGARETTES

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:30.928
DUE TO INDUSTRY PRESSURE.

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:31.729
HOWEVER THIS LED TO THE RISE OF

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:32.963
NEW PRODUCTS THAT WERE NOT

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.931
QUOTE CIGARETTES SOME YOU CAN

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:36.100
SEE ON THE FAR UPPER RIGHT THAT

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.401
DID NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW RULES

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:38.569
MADE FOR CIGARETTES. UP WITH

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.538
THE BROWN PAPER WRAPPING. YOU

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:41.472
COULD SUDDENLY HAVE A CIGARETTE

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:44.108
YOU OR LITTLE CIGAR AND YOU

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.509
DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE FLAVOR

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.977
PACKAGING RULES THAT WERE MADE

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:48.979
FOR CIGARETTES. ELECTRONIC

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:50.014
CIGARETTES FROM THE RISE AS

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.349
WELL BUT IT TOOK YEARS FOR THE

00:40:52.416 --> 00:40:53.717
FDA TO FINALIZE WHAT'S CALLED

00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:55.352
THE QUOTE DEEMING ROLL. UP TO

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:58.923
BEGIN REGULATION THAT WAS IN

00:40:58.989 --> 00:40:59.657
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THE

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:01.392
FDA DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:04.061
THAT FOR. UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.262
TWO FOR MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:07.031
INFORMATION AND IMPROVE THEIR

00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:08.098
PRODUCTS BUT NOW WITH PUBLIC

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:11.268
PRESSURE AS YOU ALL MAY WELL

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:11.902
KNOW. THIS HAS BEEN MOVED UP TO

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:16.607
NEXT YEAR. THIS COMPLICATED BUT

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:17.208
LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH THIS

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:18.275
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS CALIFORNIA

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:19.844
SUCCESS STORY IS THAT CIGARETTE

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.212
SMOKING PREVALENCE RATES HAVE

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:22.880
DECLINED FASTER THAN THE REST

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.149
OF THE COUNTRY. BUT THE NEWS

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:26.116
NOW IS THAT BEEPING AND

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:28.052
MARIJUANA USE RATES. ARE RISING

00:41:28.118 --> 00:41:30.154
ESPECIALLY IN YOUNG ADULTS. SO

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:31.422
THIS DATA FOCUSES ON THE

00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:33.190
GENERAL ADULT POPULATION IT'S

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:34.358
MISS SUMMER BAGUETTE OR HE'S

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:36.193
GOING TO DESCRIBE YOUTH AND

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.294
YOUNG ADULTS. SINCE CALIFORNIA

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:38.762
HAS A TOBACCO TWENTY ONE LAW

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:40.197
NOT TO SELL TO PERSONS UNDER

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:41.599
TWENTY ONE. SO THE BAR CHART

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:44.602
SHOWS ON THE FAR RIGHT THAT IN

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:45.135
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ARE

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:46.270
CALIFORNIA PROBLEMS FOR ANY

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.572
TOBACCO USE. WAS ALMOST FIFTEEN

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:49.874
PERCENT. ON THE FAR LEFT YOU'LL

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.141
SEE CIGARETTES THAT'S TEN

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:53.577
PERCENT. AND ONLY 3% FOR

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:55.145
BEEPING THAT LITTLE BAR THE

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:56.180
SECOND BAR FROM THE LEFT.

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:58.883
HOWEVER AT YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.584
ARE AGE TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:01.819
NINE YEARS OLD THEY BAIT THAT

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:05.155
MUCH HIGHER RATES WITH 11% IN

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:06.690
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND 13%

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:10.094
AND- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:10.728
USERS MAY USE OUR SWITCH ACROSS

00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:11.729
MULTIPLE TOBACCO PRODUCTS. AND

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:15.132
IN THE U. S. OVER HALF OF THE

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:15.699
CIGARETTE USERS ARE CURRENT

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:20.237
SMOKERS. MARIJUANA USE ON THE-

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:21.705
RIGHT IN ADULTS ESPECIALLY

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:22.806
YOUNG PEOPLE IS ALSO RISING.

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:23.374
WITH OVER ONE AND FOR YOUNG

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.942
ADULTS OVER TWENTY ONE.

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:25.943
SIMILARLY CO USE OF MARIJUANA

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.978
AND TOBACCO IS RISING NOW WITH

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:28.846
ONE EIGHT YOUNG ADULTS OVER

00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:33.651
TWENTY ONE. SO WHAT THE SLOW

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.719
FEDERAL REGULATORY LANDSCAPE

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.154
FOR VAPING IT'S DIFFICULT TO

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.023
KNOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THESE

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:40.224
THE CIGARETTE PRODUCTS AND

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:42.059
THEIR AIR ASSAULT AT DESPITE

00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:42.893
WHAT THEY'RE LABELED HOUSE THIS

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.262
IS A GRAPHIC FROM THE CDC WHERE

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:46.230
THEY NOTE THAT PRODUCTS THAT

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:47.765
ARE MARKETED AS EVEN HAVING NO

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:49.199
NICOTINE. HAVE BEEN FOUND TO

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:51.702
CONTAIN NICOTINE SO STUDIES TO

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:53.537
DATE SHOW THAT THIS AEROSOL IS

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:55.406
NOT WATER VAPOR WHICH IS WHAT

00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:56.540
MANY PEOPLE THINK AND THE

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.342
PUBLIC INSTEAD THIS AEROSOL AS

00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.843
A CHEMICAL MIXTURE THAT CAN

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.612
CONTAIN PROPYLENE GLYCOL

00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:03.047
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:04.882
CARCINOGENS HEAVY METALS

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:05.816
FLAVORS. AND CULTURE FINE

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:08.552
PARTICLES ULTRA FINE PARTICLES

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:10.854
FOR EXAMPLE CAN ARE JUST SOME

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.323
OF THE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN HAVE

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:13.924
IMMEDIATE HARMFUL EFFECTS SO

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:15.192
ALL OF US WHO EXPERIENCE THE

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.760
CALIFORNIA SMOKY FIRES FOR

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:18.028
EXAMPLE OR FREEWAY AIR

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.463
POLLUTION. THERE THOSE THINGS

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.698
ARE ALL OF THE ULTRA FINE

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:21.765
PARTICLES ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:24.768
INFLAMMATION THAT'S IMPORTANT

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:25.369
FOR HEART AND LUNG FUNCTION IN

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:28.439
PARTICULAR. EVEN IF SOME

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:29.640
PRODUCTS CONTAIN LESS OF THESE

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:30.274
HARMFUL INGREDIENTS THE CDC HAS

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:31.475
UNDERSCORED. THIS DOES NOT MEAN

00:43:31.542 --> 00:43:34.611
IT IS A SAFE PRODUCT. THERE

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:35.646
ISN'T IN FACT NO SAFE TOBACCO

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:37.948
PRODUCT WE ALREADY LEARNED THAT

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:39.917
LOW TAR CIGARETTES AS DEFINED

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:42.019
BY MACHINE DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:44.288
SAFER PRODUCT WE ARE STILL

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:44.788
LEARNING HOW HEATING AND

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:46.590
INHALING CHEMICALS IN THESE

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:50.861
PRODUCTS. AFFECT THE HUMAN BODY.

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:52.096
SO DESPITE HAVING BEEN BANNED

00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:53.530
IN CIGARETTES FLAVORS AND THEIR

00:43:53.597 --> 00:43:55.299
MARKETING OF FLAVORED TOBACCO

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:56.800
PRODUCTS ARE CONCERNING FOR THE

00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:57.768
RISE AND USE AND THEY'RE

00:43:57.835 --> 00:44:00.270
HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS. SO JUST

00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:01.472
A COUPLE EXAMPLES HERE SOME

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:03.907
MENTHOL. HAS BEEN MOST NOTABLY

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:04.875
BEEN TARGETED TOWARDS THE

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:06.677
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. ARE

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:09.313
CONTRIBUTING TO A TOBACCO

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.816
RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES.

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:13.317
JOHN BEING JUST A FLAVOR

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:14.318
PREFERENCE THE GROWING EVIDENCE

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:15.386
ABOUT MENTHOL IS THAT ITS

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.287
NUMBING PROPERTIES MAKE IT

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:17.888
EASIER EASIER TO AND INITIATE

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:20.190
AND HAIL. ITS CHEMICAL

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:21.392
PROPERTIES MAKE IT HARDER TO

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:22.793
QUIT BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.394
WORKING ON THE NICOTINE

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.162
RECEPTORS AND IT AND THERE'S AN

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:27.231
ASSOCIATE A CARCINOGEN WITH

00:44:27.297 --> 00:44:29.199
THESE OILS COUPLE GUNS AND

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:30.467
THERE THERE'S A RECENT JAM

THESE FLAVORS BY THEMSELVES AND

SURE IS FROM THE CDC AND IT

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:09.933
SHOWS ONE SMALL JEWEL POD AT E.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.301

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:12.169
NICOTINE AS ONE PACK OF

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:14.872

HIGHER E. LIQUID CONCENTRATIONS

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:23.280

00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:25.516
BAIT MARIJUANA THE SURGEON

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:26.517
GENERAL HAS PUT OUT A WARNING

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.552
THAT THC CONCENTRATIONS OF

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:29.720
INCREASED THREE FOLD OVER THE

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:31.488
PAST COUPLE DECADES. SO THIS

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:33.157
HEALTH EFFECTS OF VAPING THESE

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.191
HIGH POTENCY NICOTINE AND

00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:36.260
MARIJUANA PRODUCTS. INCLUDING

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:38.028
IN COMBINATION AND HOW HEATING

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:39.096
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:42.933
BURNING. THIS IS ALL LEARNING

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.867
FOR EVERYONE AND PUTTING THE

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:46.370
MEDICAL PROFESSION AND THIS IS

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:46.970
AN ONGOING NATURAL EXPERIMENT

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:54.144
IN HUMANS. SO AND AS MENTIONED

00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:55.179
NOW THIS PAST SUMMER WITH THE

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:55.879
VAPING ASSOCIATED PULMONARY

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:58.081
INJURY ALL THIS COMBINATION OF

00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.049
ON THE RISE IN VAPING NICOTINE

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:00.884
AND MARIJUANA. AT HAS BROUGHT

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:02.886
US TO THIS STATE UP SO EVERY

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:04.054
WEEK THE CBC'S REPORTING MORE

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:05.889
CASES SO AS MENTIONED EARLIER

00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:08.559
UP THIRTEEN HUNDRED CASES OVER

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:11.628
A HUNDRED. CASES IN CALIFORNIA

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:12.529
TWENTY SIX DEATHS INCLUDING

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:15.032
THREE IN CALIFORNIA KING COUNTY

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:18.035
TULARE COUNTY IN LA COUNTY. AND

00:47:18.101 --> 00:47:18.669
THIS ISN'T JUST A YOUTH PROBLEM

00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:19.836
BECAUSE THE MEDIAN AGE OF DEATH

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:21.572
IS FORTY NINE YEARS OLD AND THE

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:22.806
RANGE IS SEVENTEEN TO SOMEBODY

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:25.008
FIVE. AND AGAIN THE CDC STATES

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:26.109
NO SINGLE PRODUCT OR SUBSTANCE

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.879
HAS BEEN LINKED TO ALL CASES

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:29.913
ALTHOUGH MOST REPORTED BEEPING

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.415
TEACH SEE A IT'S ONLY ABOUT A

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:33.283
THIRD EXCLUSIVELY. AND WELL

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:34.384
OVER HALF REPORTED BEEPING

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:36.019
NICOTINE SO THE CDC HAVE COME

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:37.554
OUT TO SAY TO THE PUBLIC PEOPLE

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:39.223
SHOULD NOT USE VAPING PRODUCTS

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:41.258
WITH THC CONSIDER THAT AS WELL

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:43.560
FOR NICOTINE PRODUCTS ALSO.

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:45.028
OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:46.330
TO BUY BEEPING PRODUCTS OFF THE

00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:47.598
STREET OR MODIFY OR ADD

00:47:47.664 --> 00:47:50.567
SUBSTANCES HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:51.134
GET THEIR PRODUCTS SOCIALLY

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.236
FROM OTHERS SO IT'S HARD TO

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:53.670
TELL. REGARDLESS OF THE

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:54.905
INVESTIGATION THE CDC

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.774
EMPHASIZES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.710
PREGNANT WOMEN AND NEVER USERS

00:47:59.776 --> 00:48:01.111
SHOULD NOT VAPE THERE IS NO

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:03.046
SAFE TOBACCO PRODUCT USE AND T.

00:48:03.113 --> 00:48:04.147
H. C. IS ASSOCIATED WITH A WIDE

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:05.315
RANGE OF HEALTH EFFECTS

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:09.987
ESPECIALLY AMONGST HEAVY USERS.

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:10.587
AND WE'RE STILL LEARNING ABOUT

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:15.292
THAT. ON TO THE STATE. IT'S

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:16.460
WORTH NOTING ALSO THAT

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:17.995
SECONDHAND SMOKE EXPOSURE

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:19.930
NONSMOKERS HAS BECOME. THAT

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:21.198
INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ISSUE SO

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.666
THE CDC IMAGE ON THE LEFT

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:23.467
DESCRIBES HOW THE SURGEON

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:24.434

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:40.670
ADVISE AND TREAT. PEOPLE WHO

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:41.271
BAKED AND TO HELP PEOPLE QUIT

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:44.574
BAKING FOR GOOD. SO WITH THAT

00:50:44.641 --> 00:50:47.043
I'LL TRANSITION TO. SUMMER BY

THE DORY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:50.280
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY

MY NAME IS KIM HOMER BAGUETTE

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.316
OR AND I'M WITH AN ORGANIZATION

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:54.451
THAT WORKS STATEWIDE ON TOBACCO

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:55.786
CONTROL ISSUES WITH YOUTH AND

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:57.487
YOUNG ADULTS AND WE ALSO WORK

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:58.555
WITH ALL OF OUR COLLEGES AND

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:00.524
UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE ON

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.625
SMOKING TOBACCO FREE POLICY

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.293
INITIATIVES TODAY I'M GOING TO

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.828
HIGHLIGHT AND SUMMARIES FOR YOU

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.563
THE NATIONAL AND STATE DATA WE

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:07.631
HAVE ON YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULT

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:09.232
USE. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:10.233
THIS IS TOBACCO HAVE YOU

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.003
BECAUSE THAT'S MY AREA OF

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.637
EXPERTISE BUT IT'S ALSO WHAT WE

00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:16.006
HAVE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON. SO

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:17.340
LOOKING AT CURRENT USE WE NOW

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:19.009
AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THAT WE

00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:21.077
SAW OUR PEAK. IN U. FATE BEING

00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:22.479
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WE

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:25.081
STARTED TO GO DOWN. IN TWENTY

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.383
SIXTEEN WITH A SLIGHT UPTICK IN

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.984
TWENTY SEVENTEEN. MUCH OF THIS

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:29.719
IS DUE TO THE TYPES OF DEVICES

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:30.654
THAT WERE AVAILABLE ON THE

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.489
MARKET. PRIOR TO THE NEW

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:34.391
DEVICES THAT WE HAVE WE LIKE TO

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:35.559
SAY THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF

00:51:35.625 --> 00:51:37.461
PRODUCTS. WEEK SICK LIKE SIR

00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:38.862
THE FIRST THEY LOOK JUST LIKE

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:40.664
LITTLE CIGARETTES. THE SECOND

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.999
ARE THE V. PENS WHICH NOW WE'RE

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:44.301
HEARING FROM YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:46.002
REALLY ONLY BEING USED AS WAX

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:48.538
PENS TO BE. TEACH SHE

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:49.606
SOLUTIONS. AND THEN THE THIRD

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:51.842
FOR THE MONTH AND THE TANKS.

00:51:51.908 --> 00:51:53.276
AND PART OF THE CHALLENGES WITH

00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:54.444
THESE PRODUCTS WERE THEY WERE

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:55.745
NOT VERY GOOD AT DELIVERING

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:56.513
NICOTINE SUSPICION. AND SO

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.380
INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GETTING

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:58.682
SATIATED WHEN USING THEM IN

00:51:58.748 --> 00:52:01.585
TRYING TO. USE THEM OTHER THAN.

00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:05.755
OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS. TWENTY

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:06.356
EIGHTEEN THE ALL CHANGED WITH

00:52:06.423 --> 00:52:06.990
THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW POD

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:07.591
BASED PRODUCTS. THERE ARE TWO

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:08.191
THINGS THAT CHANGE WITH THESE

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:09.659
PRODUCTS THE FIRST WAS THE SIZE

00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:11.328
OF THE DEVICE WHICH IS VERY

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:12.462
PROBLEMATIC FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:14.231
BECAUSE THEY'RE EASY TO HIDE.

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.732
AND BECAUSE ARE ALSO SMALLER

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:16.800
THE BATTERIES ARE SMALLER

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:18.068
THERE'S LESS AEROSOL THAT IS

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:19.569
OMITTED FROM THEM AND SO THERE

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:22.138
IS. VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO TAX.

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:23.473
THE SECOND WAS THE TYPE OF

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.040
SOLUTIONS THAT'S IN THESE

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:25.509
PRODUCTS SO IT'S A NICOTINE

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:26.943
SALT SOLUTION IT'S EASIER TO

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.411
CONSUME AND SIGNIFICANTLY

00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:30.680
HIGHER AND NICOTINE SOLUTIONS.

00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:31.815
THAN THE OTHER PRODUCTS BEFORE

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:33.450
THESE. THESE ARE THE PRODUCTS

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:34.050
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:35.452
USING IN THESE ARE THE PRODUCTS

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:38.522
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:39.022
EPIDEMIC THAT WE ARE NOW

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:39.589
RECOGNIZING AT THE NATIONAL

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:42.425
LEVEL. SO WITHIN A ONE YEAR

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:43.793
PERIOD. WE SAW AN INCREASE OF

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.694
ONE AND A HALF MILLION STUDENTS

00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:47.130
USE STUDENTS. WHO INCREASE

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:48.164
THEIR USE OF THESE PRODUCTS

00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:51.167
WITH FREE SHIPPING. AND THE

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:51.701
GREATEST INCREASE WAS SEEN

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.670
AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. I'M

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.138
LOOKING AT THE RECENT DATA THAT

00:52:55.205 --> 00:52:56.306
WAS RELEASED FROM THE NATIONAL

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:58.275
GOVERNMENT. THIS IS PRELIMINARY

00:52:58.341 --> 00:52:59.476
DATA AND MORE WILL BE COMING

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:02.512
SOON BUT IT'S SHOWING THAT WE

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:03.547
ARE CONTINUING TO SEE AN

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:04.447
INCREASE IN THE FADING OF

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:07.350
TOBACCO PRODUCTS. AND SO IN

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:08.485
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE ALARMS

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.186
WENT OFF WE SIGN INCREASE UP TO

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:12.055
ALMOST 21% THAT HAS JUMPED

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:14.391
AGAINST NEARLY 28% AND THIS IS

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:16.226
PASTA THIRTY DAY YOU SAID THIS

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:18.461
IS NOT EVER USE THIS IS.

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:20.931
REGULAR THIRTY DAY USE. WHAT'S

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:21.965
ALSO TROUBLING IS THE TYPES OF

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:22.866
PRODUCTS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:25.335
USING SO WE KNOW IN TWENTY

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:27.203
SIXTEEN THERE OVER FIFTEEN

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.138
THOUSAND UNIQUE FLAVORS OF EVEN

00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:30.040
DEVICES ON THE MARKET. AND WE

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.841
KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WERE

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:32.609
MOST LIKELY TO USE CANDY

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:34.844
FLAVORED OR FRUIT FLAVORED. BUT

00:53:34.911 --> 00:53:38.181
IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE SEEN A

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:38.715
JUMP OF YOUNG PEOPLE USING

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:41.284
MINTS AND THEN SLATED PRODUCTS.

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:42.385
SO WE HAVE A LOT TO CELEBRATE

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:43.286
WITH OUR CIGARETTE SMOKING

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:44.387
WE'VE DONE SOME PHENOMENAL

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:46.623
GROUP WORK TO GET US DOWN 22%

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:49.092
AT THE HISTORIC LOW. BUT THAT

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.093
IS NOT THE SAME WITH ALL

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.028
TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND SO

00:53:52.095 --> 00:53:53.430
SPECIFICALLY LOOKING IN

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:56.032
CALIFORNIA. THE DATE IN TWENTY

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:57.934
EIGHTEEN WHICH WE SAW AS MUCH

00:53:58.001 --> 00:53:59.336
AS TIME WE'RE DEALING WITH

00:53:59.402 --> 00:54:01.404
RIGHT NOW. DATA A YEAR AGO CAN

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:02.472
BE ARCHAIC WHEN WE'RE DEALING

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:04.574
WITH THIS PROBLEM. BUT WHAT WE

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:06.776
HAVE IS NEARLY 11% OF TEENS

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:08.745
REPORTED TO PASS THIRTY DAY USE

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:11.014
OF VAPING DEVICES. AND YOU CAN

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:12.382
SEE WITH THE YELLOW IN THIS

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:14.384
CHART THE MAJORITY OF THE

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:15.251
PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING USED

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:17.020
REGARDLESS OF ITS VAPING OR

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:20.056
ANOTHER TOBACCO PRODUCT. IS A

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:25.762
FLAVORED. PRODUCT. I'M DATA

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.464
FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:28.465
TOBACCO SURVEY ALSO SHOWS THAT

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:29.232
YOU USE OF MARIJUANA IS HIGH.

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:29.666
SO THERE WAS NOT ANY

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.768
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM TWENTY

00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:32.369
SIXTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.003
USE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.404
THAT MARIJUANA USE AMONG TEENS

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:36.606
IS STILL HIGHER THAN TOBACCO

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:38.375
USE. AND ALSO HIGHER THAN E.

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:40.210
CIGARETTE USE. I'M THE SURVEYS

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:41.111
THAT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:42.545
ASKED ON THE SURVEY ASK

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:45.415
STUDENTS WHO REPORTED VAPING

00:54:45.482 --> 00:54:47.050
WHAT TYPES OF PRODUCTS A. B.

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:47.651
TEN THEY DID ASK OF THE BATES

00:54:47.717 --> 00:54:50.520
TEACH SEE SOLUTION. AND 21%

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:55.392
CLOSE 222% OF TEENS DID REPORT

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:55.959
VAPING TEACH SHE PRODUCTS IN

00:54:56.026 --> 00:55:01.231
CALIFORNIA. NOW LOOKING AT

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.799
YOUNG ADULTS WE SEE A SIMILAR

00:55:02.866 --> 00:55:03.299
TREND AND THAT CIGARETTE

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:05.101
SMOKING IS GOING DOWN. THE

00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:06.770
CIGARETTE USE IS GOING UP AND

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:07.704
MARIJUANA USE HAS GONE UP

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:08.805
SIGNIFICANTLY. I'M WE AGAIN I

00:55:08.872 --> 00:55:10.040
HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TRYING

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:12.042
TO REDUCE COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:12.642
BUT THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID FOR

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:15.311
BEEPING DEVICES. WHAT'S

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.212
INTERESTING AND I'VE BEEN

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:16.746
WORKING WITH COLLEGES AND

00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:18.181
UNIVERSITIES FOR OVER EIGHTEEN

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.716
YEARS. IS IT FOR A LONG TIME

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:21.251
WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE USE OF

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:23.086
TOBACCO USE RATES GO DOWN WITH

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.854
COLLEGE STUDENTS SO WE CAN

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:25.989
PREDICT THAT IF SOMEBODY DOES

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:27.724
NOT GO TO COLLEGE. THAT THEIR

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:28.992
LIKELIHOOD OF SMOKING

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:30.226
CIGARETTES HIGHER THAN SOMEBODY

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:32.796
WHO IS IN COLLEGE. NOW THAT HAS

00:55:32.862 --> 00:55:33.830
BEEN COMPLETELY REVERSED BY

00:55:33.897 --> 00:55:36.066
THIS TREND BEEPING. AND SO

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:37.067
COLLEGE STUDENTS NOW HAVE

00:55:37.133 --> 00:55:38.835
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES OF

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.370
BEEPING NICOTINE SOLUTIONS AND

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:43.573
VAPING MARIJUANA PRODUCTS THAN

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.140
INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT GO TO

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:47.844
COLLEGE. ONE CHALLENGE WITH

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:48.812
THIS SPECIFICALLY IN TWO AS OUR

00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:50.580
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MANY

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:51.681
IN CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE NOW

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:53.583
SMOKING TOBACCO FREE. HAVE AN

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.251
INFLUX OF STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:57.087
ADDICTED TO THESE PRODUCTS

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:58.188
WE'RE NOW GOING TO THEIR

00:55:58.254 --> 00:56:00.323
CAMPUSES. AND ARE IN NEED OF

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.425
SUPPORT TO HELP THEM QUIT. AND

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:02.959
THEY'RE GOING TO SMOKING

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:04.728
TOBACCO FREE CAMPUSES BUT OUR

00:56:04.794 --> 00:56:07.564
K. THROUGH TWELVE CAMPUSES ARE

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:08.164
SMOKING TOBACCO FREE IN YOUNG

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:08.732
PEOPLE ARE STILL USING THESE

00:56:08.798 --> 00:56:12.435
PRODUCTS. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:13.403
LITERATURE SPECIFIC TO WHY

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.304
YOUNG PEOPLE USE TOBACCO

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.073
PRODUCTS AND SPECIFICALLY VAPE.

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.308
WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:18.942
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE OF IT BECAUSE

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:20.543
IT'S THEIR NORM SERVE THEIR

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:21.478
FRIENDS ARE USING THESE

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:23.379
PRODUCTS OR THEY HAVE FAMILY

00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:24.347
MEMBERS WHO USE THEM THEY'RE

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:26.716
MORE LIKELY TO USE THEM. WHAT'S

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:27.951
INTERESTING IS IF YOU TALK TO A

00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:28.885
YOUNG PERSON IF YOU TALK TO

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:31.421
COLLEGE STUDENTS TO USE THEIR

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:33.089
PERCEPTION OF WHAT THE USE IS

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:35.525
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:37.727
IT ACTUALLY IS. AND SO THAT

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:39.129
MAKES THEM BELIEVE THAT IT'S

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:40.130
COMPLETELY NORMALIZED TO USE

00:56:40.196 --> 00:56:41.898
THESE PRODUCTS WHAT'S

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:42.866
INTERESTING MANY OF THE YOUNG

00:56:42.932 --> 00:56:44.334
PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH HAVE

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.969
NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO SECONDHAND

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:47.971
SMOKE INDOORS THEY'VE GROWN UP

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:49.572
IN A SMOKE FREE CALIFORNIANS

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:52.242
THE NORM OF CIGARETTE SMOKING.

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:56.012
IS NOT THERE. WE'VE COMPLETELY

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.080
REVERSED THAT WITH KEEPING

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:58.248
BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SAYING

00:56:58.314 --> 00:56:59.482
AT AND THEY THINK EVERYBODY

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:01.251
DOES IF YOU EVER TALK TO

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:01.851
EIGHTEEN YOU ASK THEM HOW. DO

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:03.887
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT BE IF THEY

00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:06.389
SAY YES EVERYBODY IS VAPING.

00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:06.956
I'M ALSO WITH FLAVORS SO

00:57:07.023 --> 00:57:08.091
FLAVORS WAS A HIGH INDICATOR OF

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:09.559
WHY PEOPLE ARE USING THESE

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:10.693
PRODUCTS TO EXPERIMENT WITH

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.463
FLAVOURS. AND IT WHEN WE ASKED

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:14.831
WE DO FOCUS GROUPS OF YOUNG

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:15.765
PEOPLE AND WE ASKED THEM ABOUT

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:18.001
THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE. AND

00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:19.602
ALL OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WE

00:57:19.669 --> 00:57:20.937
TALKED TO SAY THEY USE PRODUCTS

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:23.139
BECAUSE OF THE FLAVORS AND THEY

00:57:23.206 --> 00:57:25.208
TASTE GOOD. AND FLAVORS IN THE

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.309
VAPING DEVICES WERE AWESOME

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:27.877
COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS AT MASS

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:30.446
THE HARSHNESS OF. THE SMOKE AND

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:31.681
IT MAKES THEM BELIEVE THAT IT'S

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:34.450
NOT AS BAD. WE'VE HAD AND

00:57:34.517 --> 00:57:35.819
FLAVORED CIGARETTE PRODUCTS

00:57:35.885 --> 00:57:36.419
SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE WITH

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:37.320
THE EXCEPTION OF MONTHLY THE

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:39.055
PRODUCT. AND SO THERE'S A LOT

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:40.290
OF MISPERCEPTIONS ROUND THE

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:41.391
HARMS OF MANY OF THESE

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:43.593
PRODUCTS. AND E. CIGARETTES ARE

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.728
ALSO INCLUDED IN THAT. IT'S

00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:47.230
IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS WELL THAT

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:48.565
WHEN WE DID OUR FOCUS GROUPS

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:52.302
WITH YOU OF WHAT WE TALK

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:57.941
PRIMARILY ABOUT TOBACCO. THE

00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:58.508
CONVERSATION WE HAVE THE IN

00:57:58.575 --> 00:57:59.242
PERSON WRAPS BACK INTO

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:00.777
MARIJUANA. AND WHILE YOUNG

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:02.212
PEOPLE HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ON

00:58:02.278 --> 00:58:03.346
THE SAFETY OF E. CIGARETTES THE

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:05.548
MAJORITY OFYOUNG PEOPLE WE

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:06.015
TALKED TO BELIEVE THAT

00:58:06.082 --> 00:58:08.618
MARIJUANA WAS COMPLETELY SAFE.

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:10.653
SO ANOTHER REASON FOR THIS IS

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.088
THE ACCESS TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:14.090
SO WHEN JULIA STARTED TO BECOME

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:15.358
POPULAR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:16.559
TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE TRUTH

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:17.660
INITIATIVE THAT NATIONAL STUDY

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:18.695
SPECIFIC TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:20.563
REPORTED TOOL USE TO FIND OUT

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:21.331
WHERE THEY WERE READING THESE

00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:23.032
PRODUCTS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:24.133
MAJORITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.169
REPORTED THAT THEY WERE GETTING

00:58:26.236 --> 00:58:27.136
THEM IN THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT.

00:58:27.203 --> 00:58:29.172
AND GETTING THEM LOCALLY. AND

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:29.706
SO WHEN WE LOOK HERE IN

00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:31.207
CALIFORNIA OUR BIGGEST

00:58:31.274 --> 00:58:32.909
OFFENDERS OF RETAILERS ARE

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:34.410
SELLING TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:36.045
ACTUALLY THE TOBACCO IN THE

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:36.913
SHOPS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.314
NOT ALLOWED IN. AND YET THEY

00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:39.349
ARE SELLING AT RATES HIGHER

00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:42.252
THAN. LEVELS OF ANY OTHER

00:58:42.318 --> 00:58:46.456
RETAILER. SO SOME OF THE

00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:47.090
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. FOR AN

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:47.690
ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH

00:58:47.757 --> 00:58:48.858
YOUNG PEOPLE. THE FIRST IS WE

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:50.226
HAVE EXTENSIVE DATA TO SHOW

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:51.060
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:52.095
EXPERIMENT WITH VAPING OR YOUNG

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:53.930
PEOPLE WHO DO VAPE. ARE

00:58:53.997 --> 00:58:55.298
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:57.300
BECOME TOBACCO USERS USE A

00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:58.635
COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS THAT THEY

00:58:58.701 --> 00:59:00.670
HAVE NOT BEEN USING BUT STIL

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:01.604
WILL START USING. OR USE

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:03.873
MARIJUANA PRODUCTS. WE ALSO

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.841
KNOW THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:05.975
ARE LEAVING TODAY WOULD NOT

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.543
HAVE CONSIDERED SMOKING A

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.245
CIGARETTE. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:12.916
BEEN AT HIGH RISK FOR TOBACCO

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:13.549
USE AND NOW THEY ARE BECAUSE OF

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:16.519
THEIR BEEPING BEHAVIOR. WE ALSO

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:17.353
KNOW THAT YOU CIGARETTE RATES

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.555
ARE CONTINUING TO GROW. AND USE

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:21.824
OF COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES IS

00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:22.425
DECREASING OR STAYING THE SAME

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:25.595
IN SOME POPULATIONS. IT'S ALSO

00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:26.195
IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS DOCTORS

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:27.330
HUNG IT SAID THAT THE LAW THE

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:28.865
PRODUCTS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

00:59:28.932 --> 00:59:30.366
USING TODAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:32.769
HIGHER LEVELS. OF NICOTINE THAN

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:34.771
THE PRODUCTS OF THE PAST WHAT'S

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:36.439
HARD ABOUT THESE PRODUCTS WE

00:59:36.506 --> 00:59:38.041
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE

00:59:38.107 --> 00:59:39.842
ARE USING. SO I'M LIKE A

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:41.444
CIGARETTE THAT YOU WOULD BUY

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:42.679
YOU WOULD SMOKE IT AND THEN IT

00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:44.247
WOULD BE EXTINGUISHED AND WOULD

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:46.349
BE DONE THESE PRODUCTS ARE USED

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.217
AND SH STUDENTS ARE SHARING

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:49.652
THEM. WHEN WE TALK TO TEENS

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:50.853
ABOUT THEIR USE AND WE ASKED

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.654
THEM IF THEY ON THE PRODUCTS

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:53.289
THEY SAY NO WHAT HAPPENS IS

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:54.857
THEY LEAVE CLASS THEIR FRIEND

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:56.459
DOES A PUFF PUFF AND THEN

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:59.228
PASSES THE PRODUCT TO THEM. AND

00:59:59.295 --> 01:00:00.997
THEN THEY PUFF PUFF AND PASS IT

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.565
BACK AND SO THEY ARE SHARING

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:04.100
DEVICES AND SHARING DIFFERENT

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.702
SOLUTIONS AND OFTEN TIMES THEY

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:06.536
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:08.404
ACTUALLY BEEPING. WHAT'S ALSO

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:09.906
INTERESTING IS IN NINETEEN

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:10.406
NINETY AFTER THE MASTER

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.809
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.210
WE SAW A CHANGE IN FACT THESE

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.145
BEHAVIOR AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:17.480
WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.182
EXPERIMENT WITH TOBACCO BEFORE

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:20.850
THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND IF THEY

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:21.651
BECAME ADDICTED THEY WOULD DO

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:22.986
SO IN THEIR YOUNG ADULT YEARS.

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:25.421
AND THAT HAS SHIFTED IN MY TIME

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.223
IN TOBACCO CONTROL THIS IS THE

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.124
FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE YOUNG

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.025
ADULTS OR YOUTH THAT ARE

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.560
ACTUALLY SELF IDENTIFYING AS

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:33.029
BEING ADDICTED TO TOBACCO AND

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:36.966
SEEKING HELP IN QUITTING. AND

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:37.533
WE'RE TRYING DESPERATELY TO

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.167
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THEM THAT

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:40.436
HELP. OFTENTIMES THEY MAY NOT

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:41.738
BE READY TO QUIT BUT AT LEAST

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:46.642
MOTIVATING. FOR THOSE QUITE

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:47.110
ATTEMPTS IS CRITICALLY

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:53.349
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD.

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:54.250
LOVE THE DICTION. ARE VERY

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.685
DIFFERENT AS WELL AND AGAIN WE

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:56.519
DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:57.220
NICOTINE INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:57.987
GETTING IT'S BASED ON THE

01:00:58.054 --> 01:00:58.521
PRODUCTS ARE USING THE BY

01:00:58.588 --> 01:00:59.355
AVAILABILITY OF THOSE PRODUCTS.

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.990
THE FREQUENCY OF USE AND THAT

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:01.624
IS STILL NOT PERFECT SCIENCE TO

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:05.561
UNDERSTAND THAT. THE CALIFORNIA

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:06.963
COMMUNITIES ARE RESPONDING.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.964
THIS DATE IS ALREADY OUTDATED

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:08.498
THAT'S ANOTHER ORDINANCES

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:09.265
PASSED EARLIER THIS WEEK BUT AS

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.433
OF FRIDAY THERE WERE FORTY FOUR

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.034
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAD

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:11.667
ORDINANCES. THAT SPECIFICALLY

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:13.569
RELATED TO FLAVORED PRODUCTS

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:14.570
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.172
MUCH OF THIS WORK WAS STARTED

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:19.509
EARLY ON IN RESPONSE TO FTA NOT

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:20.710
INCLUDING MENTHOL. IN THE BAN

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:22.612
ON CIGARETTES SO MUCH OF THIS

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:23.846
WORK STARTED TO TRY TO

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.581
ELIMINATE INFLATED PRODUCTS

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:26.949
FROM THE MARKET. AND HAS SINCE

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:29.152
EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL OF

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:31.921
VAPING PRODUCTS I'M OTHER

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:32.522
PRODUCTS SUCH AS WHO GOT THE

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:33.156
MAJORITY OF HOOKAH BARS IN OUR

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:35.124
STATE ACTUALLY WITHIN A MILE OF

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.592
A COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUS

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:37.894
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THE

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.597
COLLEGES. COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:42.165
THE HIGHEST RATES OF WHO CAN

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:45.168
USE IN OUR STATE. SO WHEN WE

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:45.902
LOOK AT THIS MORE MORE

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:47.036
COMMUNITIES ARE STARTING TO

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:47.804
AMEND THEIR TO FACTORY TELL

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.238

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:50.473
SPECIFICALLY BANNING THE SALE

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.307
OF ALL FLAVORED TOBACCO

PRODUCTS ALTHOUGH SOME DO HAVE

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:53.676
EXEMPTIONS. WE DO HAVE RIGHT

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:55.244
NOW IT'S FOUR ORDINANCES BUT

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.680
PREVIOUSLY THREE ORDINANCES

01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:58.314
THAT BANNED THE SALE ELECTRONIC

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.217
SMOKING DEVICES. I'M SAN

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.185
FRANCISCO AND RICHMOND HAVE

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.886
LIMITATIONS ON THEIRS IF FTA

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:05.588
WERE TO APPROVE THESE PRODUCTS

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:06.355
LIVERMORE SPAN IS A COMPLETE

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:08.391
BAN WITH NO END DATE. AND THEN

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:09.759
OF COURSE THE BEVERLY HILLS TO

PASS AN ORDINANCE THAT BANNED

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.361
THE SALE F ALL TOBACCO

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:13.362

FOCUSED ON EAST SIX. WHEN

THAT'S NOT APPARENTLY THE

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:23.185
NUMBER ONE DRIVER CERTAINLY A

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:25.688
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR WHICH

ALSO WAS NOT IN YOUR

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:26.722
PRESENTATION WHY DO YOU THINK

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:31.260
THAT IS. SO IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.364
ARE USED TO FIND A

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:36.632
COMPREHENSIVE TOBACCO CONTROL

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:38.401

MARIJUANA FOR EXAMPLE. I CAN'T

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:56.385
COMMENT ON THAT SPECIFICALLY

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:57.853
BUT I A CAN KNOW THAT

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.488
CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE ONE OF THE

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:00.456
MOST SUCCESSFUL TOBACCO CONTROL

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:02.425
PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD AND IT'S

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.560
BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY SUCCESSFUL

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:08.597
AND REDUCING TOBACCO USE IN OUR

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:09.231
STATE AS WELL AS CHANGING NORMS

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:12.301
AROUND TOBACCO USE AND STATE.

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:14.437
SORRY I RAN INTO SEVERAL YOUNG

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:16.105
PEOPLE THEY BEGIN MY DISTRICT

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:19.542
OVER THE PAST. THIRTY DAYS AND

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:20.876
TOOK THE TIME TO KIND OF CHAT

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:22.978
WITH THEM ABOUT. WHAT THEY WERE

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:24.814
DOING AND WHAT PRODUCT THEY

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.048
WERE USING AND- FOR THINGS I

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:27.516
FROM KIND OF SHOCKING AND- AND

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:28.951
MAYBE SOMETHING WE COULD COME

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:31.287
TO EXPECT GIVEN THE PUBLICITY

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:32.288
AND THE PRESS REPORTING IN SOME

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:35.024
OF THE INFORMATION OUT THERE.

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:35.658
IS THAT THEY WERE ALL UNDER THE

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:37.960
IMPRESSION. THAT MARIJUANA

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:39.061
VAPING. WAS SAFE FROM THE

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.497
TOBACCO VAPING COULD KILL YOU.

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:42.832
I STILL THEY GOT THAT

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:43.599
IMPRESSION FROM THE NEWS

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.534
REPORTS OF SOME OF THE

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.036
INFORMATION PUT OUT THERE BY

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:48.537
ADVOCACY GROUPS AND OTHERS

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:49.839
COMICS CLOSELY FOCUSED ON

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:51.407
TOBACCO BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:52.608
DANGER WHEN CLEARLY WE DON'T

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.642
QUITE KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING IT

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:56.379
AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH WARNINGS

01:06:56.445 --> 01:07:00.483
TO. NOT PAY PERIOD UNTIL WE

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:03.252
HAVE A BETTER IDEA OR PERHAPS.

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:03.819
WE DON'T GET A BETTER IDEA

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:05.020
PEOPLE SHOULD BE BABY AT ALL.

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:07.456
AND IT'S ACTUALLY AN UNSAFE. OR

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:10.059
CRITICALLY UNSAFE PRODUCT BY IT

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.127
STRIKES ME THAT THAT'S A

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:11.927
DANGEROUS PUBLIC HEALTH

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.629
OUTCOME. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUNG

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:16.665
PEOPLE NOT INFORMED. ABOUT THE

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:20.069
REAL DANGERS WOULD YOU AGREE.

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:22.505
CORRECT YES AND AGAIN I AM I

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:24.073
GET I'M I'M NOT IN CHARGE OF

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.341
FUNDING DECISIONS IN THE STATE

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:27.410
OF CALIFORNIA BUT- DO YOU WANT

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:28.577
TO THAT WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:30.379
TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAM WHO

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:32.014
HAS. OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE TALK TO

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:34.417
YOUNG PEOPLE I WANT TO NOTE

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:36.018
THAT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SEEN

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:37.520
INCREASES AND BEEPING AMONG

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.488
YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.357
IT'S LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:45.461
LEVEL SO THE WORK THAT'S BEING

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:45.961
DONE. TO ADDRESS TOBACCO

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:49.432
CONTROL. AND WE ARE OUR MAKING

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:50.466
GOOD SUCCESSES BUT I CAN'T

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:52.735
SPEAK TO THE MARIJUANA

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:53.302
PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH

01:07:53.369 --> 01:08:00.576
ASPECT OF THAT. MISTER COOPER.

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:01.710
IS FOR THE SECOND LAURIE OF

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:03.045
THAT PROMOTION A RIGHT TO THE

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:05.181
NONPROFIT RIGHT SO YOU GUYS GET

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.049
MONEY IN BLUE THE BIG ISSUE IS

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:09.752
I AGREE WITH WHAT MR GRAY SAID

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:10.586
OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:13.222
TOBACCO TAX REVENUE IS BROUGHT

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:15.891
IN BY THE STATE AND YET LESS

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:19.862
THAN 3% IS USED FOR ENFORCEMENT

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:20.696
SO WHY PUT YOURSELF ON THE BACK

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.198
PORCH BECAUSE IT DOES. IT'S A

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.532
DIFFERENT MODEL NOW THINGS HAVE

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.701
CHANGED WITH THE BABY SO A LOT

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:26.602
OF THAT MOVIE AND READING THE

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:28.671
INFORMATION HERE ABOUT SOME

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:30.773
PAPERWORK WERE MOST THAT WHEN

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.307
THEY GO TO THE CITIES AND

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:33.509
COUNTIES GOALS EDUCATION OR

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:36.445
TRAINING BUT NOT AND FOR SOME

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:37.813
THAT'S REALLY THE BIG ISSUE

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.714
WITH THAT IN THIS LEGISLATURE

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.783
WILL DO WITH THIS ISSUE BECAUSE

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.251
THE BLACK MARKET THEY'RE THERE

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:43.652
TO MAKE MONEY AND MAKE PROFITS

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:46.188
FOR THE PEOPLE AND THAT WILL

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:48.824
TALK ABOUT LATER ON BUT- WE'VE

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:51.460
GOT CHANGE THAT MODEL IT WITH

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:52.528
THIS WE ALSO HAVE A GIMMICK

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:59.401
THING THIS. BUT YET. TO PROCESS

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:05.040
SUFFICIENT UNDER THE AG. OKAY

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:06.008
THIRTY EIGHT MILLION THIS YEAR

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:07.243
FOR CITY PH IN THE OJ. BUT ONCE

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.843
AGAIN YOU KNOW AS FAR AS OLD

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.345
OPERATIONAL. OPERATIONS THAT

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:10.513
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES. DOES NOT

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:11.914
GETTING DONE THAT MUCH. SO

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:12.448
THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:13.649
ISSUES WITH THIS BUT I PUT THE

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:14.283
BLAME ON THE STATE FOR A LOT OF

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.385
THESE ISSUES THAT COME UP FOR A

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:18.053
LONG TIME. FOR IMMEDIATE ISSUES

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.323

QUESTIONS THAT ARE RISING COME

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.252
BY THE BY THE DAY IF NOT BY THE

01:12:03.318 --> 01:12:06.088
HOUR. I DO THINK THAT IS THE

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.990
OVER ARCHING TOPIC IS IMPORTANT

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.525
AS YOU SAID DR I THINK THAT'S

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:10.459
KIND OF HOW I SET UP THE

THIS THE YOUTH EPIDEMIC AND WE

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:17.800

OF IT SOME SAY THE LEGAL PIECES

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.850
BUT HOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:37.019
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A REAL

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:39.254
QUESTION WE HAVE TO OFFER ASK

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:42.357

DESERVE THE STREET THIS IS. AN

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:06.215
ALTERNATIVE. AND HAVE BEEN

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:07.449
THERE THEY HAVE SAID THAT IT'S

01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:08.250
A SAFE ALTERNATIVE IN THE FDA

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:09.718
OF COURSE. CAME AT THEM AND

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:10.419

GUESS THAT'S NECESSARY. ILLEGAL

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:24.666

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:28.203

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:50.072
HAVE THE ADVERTISING IN CELL

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:53.308

AND IT'S COMING FROM ALL

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:56.545
DIFFERENT ANGLES AND YOU KNOW

01:16:56.611 --> 01:16:58.080
IT'S PART OF ITS OF COMING UPON

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:00.682
US TO REALLY ACT AND I KNOW

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:03.919
THERE'S NO ONE SOLUTION. I GET

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:05.988
THAT IS NOT ONE BILL ONE THING

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:07.656
I KNOW TALK ABOUT LESTER'S OF A

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:10.459
PACKAGE OF THINGS ON THE MENU

01:17:10.525 --> 01:17:12.427
TO DO TO TACKLE THIS AND I

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.563
THINK THAT THE WORK WE WERE

01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:14.997
DOING THIS TODAY THE

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:16.732
CONVERSATION HOPEFULLY GET BE

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.567
PUSHING SOME POLICY IN THE NEAR

01:17:18.633 --> 01:17:22.537
FUTURE CITIES ARE STEPPING UP

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:23.138
AND DOING IT TOO BUT- I DON'T

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:26.641
THINK THAT ONE. FLAVOR BANNER

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:28.010
POLICY IS GOING TO YOU KNOW.

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:29.945
EVEN IF YOU GO AFTER THE SHOPS

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:30.545
AND MISTER GRAY AND I HAD SOME

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:33.715
AMAZING. EXHORTATIONS THIS PAST

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:35.650
YEAR TALKING ABOUT THE SHOPS

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:36.551
THAT ARE GETTING SICK THE

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.920
STINGS IT'S NOT THE GROCERY

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:42.057
STORES IT'S THE LITTLE MON POSH

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.425
SHOPS AND THEY'RE THE ONES ARE

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.961
HAVING THE HUGE HUGE NUMBERS

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:47.863
AND SO HAVING MORE ENFORCEMENT

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:48.497
THERE LIKE MISTER COOPER SO I

01:17:48.563 --> 01:17:51.333
THINK IS PART OF THE SOLUTION.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.434
BUT EVEN IF WE SHUT DOWN THAT

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.369
YOU KNOW KIDS ARE SMART. THEY

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.471
FIGURE OUT MOM'S HOUSE WHERE TO

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:58.974
AMAZON AND BUY STUFF ONLINE AND

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:00.876
SO IT'S GONNA TAKE A MULTITUDE

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:04.379
OF WAYS TO GO AFTER THIS SO AT

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:06.048
THE LAST TOPIC I WANTED

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:09.251
DISCUSSES. I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:10.986
IT'S A NEW WANTS TO ISSUE WITH

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:18.093
THAT WITH THE NON TOBACCO.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.161
VAPING AND FIRST ONE EVEN KNOW

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.862
HOW MANY. IF THERE IS IT IS IT

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:22.798
PREVALENT FOR THAT CANNABIS

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:24.766
VAPING AND FLAVORS. DO DO WE

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.169
KNOW THAT. SO I TRIED TO GET

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.971
DATA ON THE BEEPING

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:32.007
SPECIFICALLY I HAVE TEACH SEE

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:34.643
AND FLAVOR TEACH SEE AND I DO

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:36.078
NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT EXISTS.

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:39.081
OKAY SO IF IT HAS MISTER GRACE

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.382
SUGGEST IF WE DID HAVE A ACROSS

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:43.318
THE BOARD NO FLAVOR FOR TOBACCO

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:45.854
AND CANNABIS REALLY KNOW HOW

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:47.489
MUCH THAT WOULD IMPACT THAT.

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:50.792
CANNABIS VAPING PRODUCTS.

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:53.028
POTENTIALLY IT'S YET CORRECT MY

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.996
EXPERTISE IS NOT IN TEACH

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.998
SEASIDE SO I'M NOT AWARE OF

01:18:57.065 --> 01:18:58.733
WHAT PERCENT OF VAPING DEVICES

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.735
ARE SOLD IN FLAVORS AND WHAT

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:02.137
PERCENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:04.639
BEEPING FLAVORED WAX PENS OKAY

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:06.908
WORD PEACHY DEVICES AND IN THE

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:08.777
LAST ISSUE IN THIS THE QUESTION

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:10.278
WHICH I THINK IS THE QUESTION

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:11.880
WE'RE ASKING ABOUT THE ILLNESS

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:14.349
IS AND IT'S MAINLY FROM. THE

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.652
THC PRODUCTS AND THE INDUSTRY

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:19.287
SAYING HEY THAT'S NOT OUR

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:21.923
PRODUCT THAT'S THE ILLEGAL

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.725
BLACK MARKET PRODUCT IS COMING

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.393
OVER AND THEY'RE NOT HAVING THE

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.663
SAME METALS IN THERE THAT WE

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:32.901
HAVE BEEN TESTED AND SO FOR I

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:33.502
DON'T KNOW THE SCIENCE. I MAY

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:37.572
BE MESSING THAT UP. BUT I WOULD

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:38.807
ASSUME THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE. WHO

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.375
USE THIS PRODUCT THEY USE IT

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:40.976
ALL RIGHT THEY DON'T THEY'RE

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.511
NOT. THEY DON'T TO JUST DO ONE

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:43.712
OR THE OTHER SO IT'S HARD TO

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:48.450
TELL WHICH ONE. WAS THE CULPRIT.

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.952
AND SO IS THERE A WAY TO HAVE

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:53.288
AND- THEY FONG NUANCED WAY FOR

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:55.824
THE CANNABIS PRODUCTS. AND GO

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:59.361
AFTER. THE DEVICES THAT ARE

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:00.762
REALLY CAUSING HARM CAN WE

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.330
UNDERSTAND THAT. IT ALMOST

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:04.432
GETTING AT YES BUT I THINK

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:06.401
THAT'S WHY THE CDC HAS COME OUT

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.436
SAYING OUT OF ALL THE FIVE

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:09.571
HUNDRED AND SO. THINGS THEY

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.139
COULD GET FROM THE CASES THAT

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:13.508
WERE SICK. AND THEY COULDN'T

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:14.709
FIND ONE SUBSTANCE OR ONE

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:17.612
PRODUCT TO. CALL UPON THAT'S

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.381
WHY THEY'RE STILL MAKING THAT

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:20.715
VERY STRONG STATEMENT EVERYONE

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.450
PLEASE JUST STOP THE DENTAL

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:24.319
WILL TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. I

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:26.121
DON'T THINK WE REALLY KNOW AND

01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:27.422
I. SO FAR THERE'S NO SUGGEST TO

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:30.425
SAY AS A SAFE DEVICE. OR WAY OF

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:32.260
VAPING OR WHAT CHEMICAL SO THE

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:33.295
MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS WITH THE

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:36.364
CDC AND SAME. WITH THE ALL THE

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:38.066
QUESTIONS AND NOT ENOUGH

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:39.401
ANSWERS WE SHOULD JUST DO IT

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:41.069
TIME OUT ON ALL THE STUFF. I

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:43.638
THINK THAT WOULD BE. THE SAME

01:20:43.705 --> 01:20:48.944
THING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. AND IT

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.278
IS THEIR ONGOING RESEARCH THAT

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:51.646
THE LABELS YOU TO SEE IF THEY-

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:52.280
THEIR DEVICES THAT ARE. LEGALLY

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:53.782
SOLD. DO YOU HAVE SOME SAFETY

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:56.851
REQUIREMENTS IN THEM. THAT SO

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:58.420
THIS IS WHERE THE FTA

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.721
REGULATION IS SUPPOSED TO COME

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:00.555
INTO PLAY WHERE THE

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.791
MANUFACTURERS ARE SUPPOSED TO

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:04.459
SUBMIT. INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:05.760
PRODUCTS AND THE EFFECT ON

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:08.263
HEALTH. SO THAT'S WHY THAT

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:09.664
DEADLINE THAT MORATORIUM IS

01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:15.270
NOW. BEING UP TO NEXT YEAR OKAY

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:15.870
THANK YOU AND I KNOW OUR LATER

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:19.174
PANEL HAS. THE COUNCIL THAT

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:19.774
POTENTIALLY THESE ISSUES WILL

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:22.911
BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU THE

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:24.879

AGAIN. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:31.453
THE CONVERSATION I THINK FOR ME

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:33.388
I FIRST STARTED THINKING ABOUT

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:36.258
THIS IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:36.791
TWELVE WHEN I WAS A SCHOOL

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:37.425
BOARD AND WE DID NOT KNOW IF

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:38.560
OUR TOBACCO POLICY FOR STUDENT

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:40.195
CONDUCT ACTUALLY COVERED

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:41.196
MEETING IT WAS VERY CONFUSING

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:43.465
THEN WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THE LAW.

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:45.500
ALLOWED FOR THAT AND I THINK

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.002
SINCE THEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:50.005
HAVE EVOLVED IN THE THINKING

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:52.407
AND I KNOW SOME OF MY

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:55.043
COLLEAGUES HAVE TOUCHED UPON.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.413
ISSUES OF ENFORCEMENT OR IMPACT.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.047
ONE OF THE CITY I HEARD IN THIS

01:21:59.114 --> 01:21:59.648
PRESENTATION REPEAT. THE LACK

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:01.283
OF UNDERSTANDING AND EDUCATION

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.151
WHICH I FIND TO BE ONE OF THE

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.953
HARDER THINGS TO DO TO EDUCATE

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.454
THE PUBLIC. AND SO I JUST

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:08.757
WONDERED IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:09.924
WHAT YOU'RE SEEN IN TERMS OF

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.860
BEST PRACTICES EDUCATING. THE

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:14.396
USE WORK OUR PUBLIC ABOUT THIS

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:16.131
CERTAINLY THERE HAVE BEEN

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.565
ARTICLES. CLEARLY THE ARTICLES

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:20.268
HAVE NOT HAD AN IMPACT ON NO

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:23.171
MASS NUMBER OF MINERS. I

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:24.539
DECREASING THEIR USE AT LEAST

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:25.674
NOT WITH THE DAY THAT YOU

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.076

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:30.245
PRACTICES WHAT WHAT IS

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:33.715

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:37.619
EDUCATE MINORS. AND ADULTS

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:40.355
ABOUT THE IMPACT. THANK

01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:45.393
THE TRACK CONTROL PROGRAM.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:46.227
CALIFORNIA SO THE FOR THE FOCUS

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.262
OF THAT PROGRAM PROGRAM IS TO

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:48.363
DE NORMALIZE THE USE OF TOBACCO

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.999
CONTROL AND PART OF THAT IS BY

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:51.599
ENGAGING COMMUNITIES TO CHANGE

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:52.867
THE NORMS OF. ACCESS TO TOBACCO

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:55.403

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.549
AND COMMUNITIES THE LOCATION OF

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:09.718
THOSE RETAILERS AND MOVING THEM

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:12.487
AWAY FROM SCHOOLS SO THAT'S

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:14.656
PART OF IT THE SECOND SIDE IS

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:15.757
TO DO THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN. AND

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:19.427
TO TRY TO ENGAGE. AND WHAT'S

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:20.795
ANYA. AROUND NOT JUST THE

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:21.863
DANGERS OF THE PRODUCTS BUT

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:23.064
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:25.533
COMMUNITIES AND TOBACCO

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.268
INDUSTRY TACTICS AND SO THAT

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:29.237
WORK IS CONTINUING. SO THAT'S

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:29.871
JUST A SIDE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.773
OF PUBLIC HEALTH PASSED. THE

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.007
PART OF EDUCATION WHO'S ALSO

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:35.343
PARTNER IN THIS WORK THEN DOES

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:37.379
THE SCHOOL WORK SPECIFICALLY

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:39.647
AND SO THERE FUNDING THROUGH

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:40.882
THEIR TOBACCO USE PREVENTION

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:42.384
EDUCATION PROGRAM. BINGO

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:51.092
PROBLEM OF THESE PRODUCTS WHAT

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:52.360
HI THIS OFF GUARD WAS HOW

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:55.597
QUICKLY IS PRESS ROOM. AND AS

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:56.765
ASSEMBLY FOR GREAT DEAD THAT

01:23:56.831 --> 01:24:02.570
OFTENTIMES WE GO. TO SCHOOLS

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:03.171
AND WE ASK WHAT PRODUCT YOUNG

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:05.940
PEOPLE ARE USING. I'VE I

01:24:06.007 --> 01:24:07.442
REMEMBER I WAS ACTUALLY AND I'M

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:08.643
MADERA COUNTY AND TALK TO SOME.

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:09.177
WORKING WITH HIGH SCHOOL

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:10.378
STUDENTS AND LEARN THE ALL OF

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:10.979
THE PRODUCTS THEY CONFISCATED

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:12.080
WERE WAX PEN AND I WAS

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:13.148
SURPRISED BY THAT BUT WHEN WE

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:14.516
TALK TO STUDENTS WE FIND OUT

01:24:14.582 --> 01:24:16.551
THAT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:18.086
TO BE AHEAD OF THE GAME SO WHEN

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:21.222
WE FOCUS JUST ON JUL. PARENTS

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:21.856
KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE SO THEY'RE

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:23.391
LOOKING FOR JEWEL AND SO THEN

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:27.429
KIDS GO TO SOARING OR THEY GO

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.664

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:32.467
GET THE BIGGER PICTURE NOT JUST

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:34.969
FOCUS ON A PRODUCT BUT TRYING

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.638

BY HAVING MEDIA CAN. TO MAKE

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:44.078

AT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:45.780
CREATING NOT SO MUCH ON THE

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.682
SALES ON THE USE OF THESE

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:50.051
PRODUCTS. I KNOW THAT THE

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:51.052
MAJORITY OF OUR COLLEGES AND

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.420
UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATES

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.255
HAVE. COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:57.225
THAT COVER THE INHALATION OR

BRACE PRODUCT ON THEIR CAMPUS.

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:02.530
AND THE IDEA THAT IF WE CAN

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:03.565
REMOVE THE DISRUPTING VISIBLE

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:05.500
THAT CHANGE THE NORM THEN THAT

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:08.102
WILL THEN. CHANGE PEOPLE'S USE

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:09.504
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WANTS TO USE

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:10.638
THAT. IT'S A REALLY

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:14.008
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THAT

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:14.909
COMMUNITIES ARE WORKING ON

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:15.944
COMMITTEE COLLECTIONS ARE. THE

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.579
STATE. DEPARTMENT PUBLIC OF HAS

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:18.146
A REALLY ROBUST VERY SICK.

01:25:18.213 --> 01:25:22.417
IMMEDIATE AND THEN THE

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.219
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS

WORKING WITH IN SCHOOLS TO TRY

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:33.862
TO DRAW FROM APPROACH. BOB

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:35.363
PARENTS TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.964
THESE AND THEN REALLY HELPING

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.498
TO A QUICK STOP TO EQUIP

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:37.532
TRUSTED ADULTS TO BE ABLE TO

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:38.566
ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT USE TO

COMPREHENSIVE IT IS THE PROBLEM.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:52.814
IN THE POTENTIAL SOLUTION AND

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:53.915
SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF OUR

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.750
DEFINITION OR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:57.452

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:59.087

BE EDUCATED AS WELL. WE DO IT

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:14.936
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK AND

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.404
TREAT THESE THINGS AND THE WHAT

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:18.840
THE KIDS ARE DOING WE DON'T

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:19.474
EVEN KNOW THAT THEY'RE THE SAME

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:22.010

THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TACKLE

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:37.685
THIS AND THEY'RE ASKING

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:38.886
SPECIFICALLY FOR ADDITIONAL

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:40.221
HELP OFTEN THE STATE TO ATTACK

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:40.788
THIS DO YOU HAVE ANY AGAINST

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:41.923
INSIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THAT

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:43.625
OF LOCALS AND THE ROLE OF STATE

01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:45.627
VERSUS LOCAL AND AGAIN. SEEING

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:46.894
THAT THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:49.397
SPECIFICALLY GOING TO SELLING

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:51.032

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.734
TOBACCO STORES DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.703

YOU ARE ENGAGING TALKING TO

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.141
THOSE MOST IMPACTED. THEIR

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:02.076
NUMBER JURISDICTIONS ARE

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:03.845
STRONGER TUCKER RETAIL

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:06.180
INSTANCES MANY DON'T HAVE

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:08.750
RETAIL LICENSES RIGHT NOW AND

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.685
ARE LOOKING AT ADOPTING THEM

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:12.053
WITH STRONGER FEES ASSOCIATED

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.288
STRONGER PASSED TO YOU AND THEN

01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:15.790
ALSO THE INCLUSION OF FLAVOR

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:20.194
BANDS. THAT THE PHONE FLAVOR

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:26.734
VAN IS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT.

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:27.335
PEOPLE ARE IN THIS BACK TO YOU

01:28:27.402 --> 01:28:32.240
SPEAK HAS THE PROPER. THEY SEEM

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:35.243
LESS WELL AS SALT. THOSE

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:36.978
PRODUCTS IT'S ELIMINATING

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:37.545
PRODUCTS THAT ARE ATTRACTING

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:40.682
USED TO PURCHASE. YOUR BY THE

01:28:40.748 --> 01:28:41.315
BED TO IT AS WELL SOURCE IN THE

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:42.583
TRANS A GIVEN YOUR PRESENTATION

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:43.885
THERE ARE THAT THAT'S A

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:44.752
RELATIVELY SMALL SEGMENT OF

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:45.353
LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.721
ACTUALLY TAKEN ACTION. AND YET

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:48.489
THE IMPACTED POPULATIONS SINGS.

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:49.791
IT IS TO USE ALSO SHOWN THE

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:51.893
PERCENTAGE CONTINUES TO RISE

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:53.995
BUT AGAIN I THINK IT MAY BE DO

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:54.562
YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHTS WITH

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:56.664
RESPECT TO DO YOU BELIEVE THAT.

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:58.132
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE

01:28:58.199 --> 01:28:59.767
ACTUALLY DOING WHAT THEY CAN

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:01.636
AND SHOULD BE DOING TO TRY TO

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:03.237
TACKLE THIS ISSUE IS GIVEN THE

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:04.739
RATES AND THEN ALSO GIVEN THE

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:06.841
STATISTICS OF THAT OF

01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:09.177
ENFORCEMENT GOING TO MINORS

01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:11.813
BECAUSE AGAIN LOCAL CITY HERE

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:12.613
ALL THE TIME THE CONTROL BUT

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.247
THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT AGAINST ALL

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:16.684
IF. OF THE MIND MINERS ARE

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:20.054
BEING SOLD THESE PRODUCTS. I

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:20.888
THINK THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:21.723
IN THE STATE HAVE A STRONGER

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:22.323
HISTORY OF ADOPTING STRONG

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:23.591
TOBACCO CONTROL ORDINANCES AND

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:24.926
WE SEE THAT WITH THOSE

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:26.394
JURISDICTIONS HAVING POLICIES

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.062
IN PLACE NOW. I KNOW THAT

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:29.630
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK BEING

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:32.033
DONE THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT I

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.668
KNOW THAT THEIR REGIONS WHERE

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:35.570
IT MAY NOT BE HAPPENING. SURE

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:37.038
DID YOU OFF THE TOP HER HEAD

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:39.941
YOU TO JUST REFERENCE THAT

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:40.508
NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:41.275
HAVE COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES

01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:45.613
THAT MAYBE HE'S- DOING BETTER

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.114
WITH RESPECT TO THAT OF

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:46.714
ENFORCEMENT AND SOME HIS BOSS

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:49.951
ALREADY. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT

01:29:50.017 --> 01:29:50.518
AND FORCE MEANT PIECE BUT I

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:51.686
KNOW THAT. SPECIFICALLY THE BAY

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:54.021
AREA HAS BEEN THE CHAMPION. FOR

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:55.490
FLAVORED ORDINANCE I WE KNOW

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:57.492
THAT LOS ANGELES HAS RECENTLY

01:29:57.558 --> 01:29:59.193
THERE COUNTY HAS RECENTLY HAD

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.161
AN ORDINANCE THE CITY IS

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:01.963
LOOKING AT AN ORDINANCE. THE

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:03.798
CITY OF SACRAMENTO'S WHICH JUST

01:30:03.865 --> 01:30:05.466
WENT INTO EFFECT. SO DEFINITELY

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:07.268
MORE OF THE URBAN COMMUNITIES

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:10.738
HAVE ORDINANCES THAT ARE.

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:13.107
ALREADY ADOPTED OR CLOSER TO

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:14.976
ADOPTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:18.880
MISTER COOPER. A FOLLOW UP TO

01:30:18.946 --> 01:30:19.480
DISCLOSE QUESTIONS ORDINANCES

01:30:19.547 --> 01:30:20.782
THEY HAPPEN IN PLACE BUT YOU

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:22.183
WALK AROUND DOWNTOWN OUTSIDE

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.651
PEOPLE STILL VAPING BE AT

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.920
SACRAMENTO LA OR SAN FRANCISCO

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:28.222
BUT ONLY BACK TO DOCTOR CDCS TO

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:30.391
TAKE A BREAK FROM VAPING AND

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:33.060
THAT'S JUST UNREALISTIC I THINK

01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:34.796
WHEN PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED IN

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:40.468
ADDICTION BE IT TOBACCO ALCOHOL

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:43.671
THE C. DRUGS. IT IS TOUGH TO

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.439
KEEP NO MATTER WHAT. SO WE'VE

01:30:45.506 --> 01:30:47.341
GOT A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE.

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:48.409
OUT THERE AND I THINK IT'S

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:50.778
UNREALISTIC TO DO THAT MAYBE

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:51.913
TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHATEVER WE

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:53.447
FIND OUT WE MORE INFORMATION ON

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:55.016
THIS I DON'T KNOW THERE'S NO

01:30:55.082 --> 01:30:56.417
TIME LINE REALLY AND I'M SURE

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:58.286
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN ANYTIME

01:30:58.352 --> 01:31:01.055
SOON. SO BEING REALISTIC.

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.191
THEY'RE NOT TAKING A BREAK. I

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:06.627
GUESS THAT'S THE DOCTOR. VAPING

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:07.361
IF IT'S I GUESS IF IT'S NOT

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:09.497
FROM THE BLACK MARKET IS STILL

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:12.466
SAFER THAN SMOKING TOBACCO THEN.

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:13.601
SO I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:16.003
FTA REGULATION AS OF THE

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.972
CIGARETTES IS STILL NOT THERE

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:21.242
AND- THIS IS FOR THE

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:22.877
MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT

01:31:22.944 --> 01:31:25.179
INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH SO I

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:26.681
DON'T THINK WE CAN EVEN MAKE

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:29.083
THAT STATEMENT THAT IT'S A SAFE

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.251
AND IT RIGHT NOW THE CITY

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.019
SAYING THERE IS NO. SAFE

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:35.323
TOBACCO PRODUCT. WE KNOW THAT

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:36.457
THEIR INHALING THESE CHEMICALS

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:37.959
WITH VAPING CAN HAVE IMMEDIATE

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:40.862
HEALTH EFFECTS SO. AS THE

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:43.130
SURGEON GENERAL HAS NOTED YOU

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:44.265
KNOW EVEN FOR NON USERS

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:46.000
SECONDHAND AEROSOL HAS HARMFUL

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:48.269
CONSTITUENTS. SO I THINK WHAT

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:49.036
WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS MAYBE

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:51.038
WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS.

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:52.373
DOES MAYBE HAVING LESS

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:56.277
CARCINOGEN AND SOME OF THESE

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:57.879
PRODUCTS MAYBE DOES THAT MEAN

01:31:57.945 --> 01:32:00.281
LESS HARM AND I THINK THAT'S

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:04.585
WHY I'M TRYING TO. ALSO SHOW OF

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:05.186
THIS IS MAYBE WHAT WAS FOR LOW

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:07.588
TOP BEFORE BUT IT. SCIENTIFIC

01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:08.189
EVIDENCE TO KEEP COMING EVERY

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:10.024
DAY. THE MEDIA BIOLOGICAL

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:11.225
EFFECTS AND IT'LL TAKE A FEW

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:13.694
YEARS TO GET EPIDEMIOLOGY DATA

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:15.863
SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.398
OF THE PUBLIC CONFUSION IS

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:19.767
WHERE THEY THINK THESE ARE

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:20.368
NEWER SAFER CLEANER PRODUCTS

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:21.836
THEY DON'T MAKE YOU SMELL IT

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:23.537
MIGHT MUST BE BETTER BUT I

01:32:23.604 --> 01:32:26.407
THINK WE ARE NOW. FINDING OUT.

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.709
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF. ON THE

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:30.544
SCIENCE SO FAR THE SIGNS THIS.

01:32:30.611 --> 01:32:31.779
THIS IS NOT A SAFE PRODUCT SO

01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:33.514
FOR SOME THE PREVIOUS VAPING

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.884
PENS FROM NICOTINE PART THAT

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:37.385
ONE THREE FTA THEY WERE

01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:39.954
APPROVED BY THE FDA AND TESTED.

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:40.955
THE NEVER WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:42.990
THE MANUFACTURE SUBMITTED TO

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:46.460
THE FDA RIGHT SO I THINK AND

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:47.461
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AT THE

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:49.130
DEEMING RULED BY THE FDA IS

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:50.965
THAT IT HAS A FORTY. TO

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:53.267
REGULATE E. CIGARETTES BUT

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:55.369
RIGHT NOW WHATEVER'S ON THE

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:57.371
LABEL IT'S NOT REGULATED BUT

01:32:57.438 --> 01:32:59.173
THAT HASN'T BEEN IMPLEMENTED

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.207
YET SO THAT'S WHY THEY STARTED

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:01.309
TRYING TO MOVE UP THAT

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.910
MORATORIUM TO SAY START

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:04.612
SUBMITTING IT'S ACTUALLY IN

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:08.149
THESE THINGS THE FDA DOES FUND

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:09.450
WHAT'S CALLED TO COURT THESE

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:10.785
TOBACCO CENTERS OF REGULATORY

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:12.286
AND SEVEN PRODUCING SOME OF

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:14.989
THIS. SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:16.324
IT NEEDS TO BE COMPILED AND

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:20.261
THEY'RE ALSO INFORMING THE FTA

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:24.532
ABOUT THESE PRODUCTS AS WELL SO.

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:25.933
IT'S STILL EARLY STAGES TO SAY

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:26.901
THAT THESE THAT WE EVEN KNOW

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:28.102
WHAT'S IN THESE PRODUCTS AND

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:30.171
THE EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH SO

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:30.771
THE MEDIA'S BEEN ALL OVER THIS

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.239
NAY FAMILIAR EGGS. A LOT OF

01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:33.240
TEST SAMPLES FOR TESTING AND

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:34.709
FROM WHAT I'VE- SEEN. IN THE

01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:36.644
MEDIA. OTHER TESTS OF THAT CAME

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:38.746
BACK. WERE FROM THE ILLICIT

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:40.414
MARKET. BE IT TOBACCO OR

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.883
CANNABIS. IN NOT THE GYM IT

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:45.820
MANUFACTURES. SO AS IN WHEN YOU

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:47.855
LOOK AT THIS I MEAN A LOT OF IT

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:49.523
COMES FROM. EARLIER YOU GUYS

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:50.057
TALKED ABOUT THE BRICK AND

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:51.659
MORTAR IT'S LIKE SEVENTY FOUR

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:54.328
PERCENT. A LOT OF IT COMES FROM

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:58.199
THE ILLICIT MARKET SO. HEY IT

01:33:58.265 --> 01:33:58.766
IT SEEMS TO ME IN JUST AS A

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.267
LEYVA IN THAT THAT IS A BIG

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:01.202
ISSUE WITH IT WHERE A LOT OF

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:03.037
THESE PRODUCTS DO COME FROM. NO

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:04.472
DOUBT THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:06.273
TO BE REGULATED AND YOU KNOW AS

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:09.677
YOU'RE MENTIONING YOU KNOW WE

01:34:09.744 --> 01:34:10.277
NEED. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:11.579
ALSO HELP WITH THIS BUT AS- YOU

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:13.581
KNOW I THINK. IT'S VERY

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:15.216
CHALLENGING BECAUSE THE

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:15.950
PRODUCTS THAT THE CDC

01:34:16.017 --> 01:34:17.852
INVESTIGATION HAS THEN IT'S NOT

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:19.120
EVEN ALL OF THE CASES THAT

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:20.521
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:22.156
PRODUCTS AND TEST SO THEY DON'T

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:23.624
KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT THEY

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:24.892
CONCLUDE IS RIGHT NOW THERE IS

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:27.962
NO SINGLE PRODUCT OR SUBSTANCE.

01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:28.896
AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE SAYING

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:30.131
PLEASE ASK SOME OF THESE

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:31.298
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:32.867
GETTING IT HOW ARE THEY USING

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:34.435
IT WHAT ARE THEY FILLING IT UP

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.971
WITH AND THEY'RE ASKING DOCTORS

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:37.571
TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS TO HELP

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:39.640
IT OUT. WE DON'T KNOW. THANK

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:47.782
YOU. ANYONE ELSE. I'D LIKE TO

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:48.349
GO AHEAD OF ALL OF THE LAST

01:34:48.416 --> 01:34:53.354
YEAH. SO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:34:53.421 --> 01:34:55.456
INSPIRED SOME ADDITIONAL

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:59.260
QUESTIONS FOR YOU. WHAT IS IT

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:00.795
YOU KNOW THE DEBATE OR

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:02.997
DISCUSSION THE DIALOGUE IN THE

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:03.631
STATE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA

01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:06.567
THIS YEAR. WAS PREDOMINANTLY ON

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:07.902
ONE HAND FOLKS THAT WANTED TO

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:11.405
FOCUS. ON THE MORATORIUM FOR

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:13.407
THE BANNING OF FLAVORED. HE

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:18.212
SAID PRODUCTS. AND THE OTHER.

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:19.947
BLESSED AFTER WE HAD WAS TO

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:22.383
FOCUS MORE ON THE OVERSIGHT

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:26.420
REGULATION TAXATION OF THE SIX

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:28.589
AS WE DO IN TO PATRICIA TRACK.

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:30.057
I WAS INVOLVED IS ONE OF THE

01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:31.358
AUTHORS ON THE OVERSIGHT

01:35:31.425 --> 01:35:33.461
REGULATORY APPROACH AND THE

01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:34.128
INSPIRATION FOR THAT WAS

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:36.530
FRANKLY ATTRITIONAL TRACK RIGHT

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.165
WE'VE SEEN INTEREST MICHAEL

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:39.934
EDUCATION OVERSIGHT REGULATION

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.871
TAXATION HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL.

01:35:43.938 --> 01:35:46.440
RECIPE TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:47.208
WITH YOUTH AND THE GENERAL

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:50.811
PUBLIC RIGHT. AND SOMETIMES WE

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:52.012
DON'T NEED TO BE SMARTER THAN

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:54.081
OURSELVES UP HERE BUT RATHER

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:55.316
LOOK AT AFFECTED PRACTICES IN

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:58.085
THE REPLICATION THIS IS SO. AT

01:35:58.152 --> 01:35:59.520
ONE POINT WE HAD A BILL BEFORE

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:03.090
LEGISLATURE THAT OF THE FIFTEEN

01:36:03.157 --> 01:36:06.660
THOUSAND REPORTED. TOBACCO

01:36:06.727 --> 01:36:07.261
FLAVORS EASTICK FLAVORS THAT

01:36:07.328 --> 01:36:09.029
WERE OUT THERE WOULD HAVE

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:12.533
RESTRICTED THE SALE FOURTEEN

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.100
THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY

01:36:13.167 --> 01:36:13.701
SEVEN AMONG CONSISTENT WITH

01:36:13.767 --> 01:36:14.702
TRADITIONAL TRACK WHERE YOU

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:16.203
HAVE MEANT ALL INTERNATIONAL

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:18.372
TOBACCO FLAVORS AVAILABLE BUT

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:21.709
NOT. SOME OF THESE FLAVORS THAT

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:25.012
WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. AND. THE

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:25.913
COMMITTEE THAT I SERVE ON THE

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.715
REGULATORY TRACK OF ALCOHOL AS

01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:29.817
WELL AND I WOULD POINT TO

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:31.085
PROHIBITION IN THE EARLY PART

01:36:31.152 --> 01:36:33.187
OF THE LAST CENTURY AS AN

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:34.221
EXAMPLE OF WHERE MORE TRAINS

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:36.190
BANDS. AREN'T ACTUALLY ALWAYS

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:39.460
EFFECTIVE IN FACT SOMETIMES

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:40.094
THEY SERVE TO EXASPERATED BLACK

01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:42.963
MARKET. AND NOW IS WERE FACED

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:45.199
WITH REAL HEALTH CONCERNS THAT

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:48.068
ALL EVIDENCE THUS FAR SEEMS TO

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:50.070
POINT TO BLACK MARKET PRODUCTS.

01:36:50.137 --> 01:36:51.305
I HAVEN'T SEEN I HAVEN'T READ A

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:55.075
LOT THAT SUGGESTS THE LEGAL THC

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.911
AND OR TOBACCO PRODUCTS WERE

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:57.478
COSTS THAT THEY MAY BE AND

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:59.713
OTHERS A LOT YET TO LEARN. BUT

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.882
WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT SOME OF

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:02.449
THESE BLACK MARKET PRODUCTS

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:06.687
HAVE CAUSED SOME DAMAGE. SO. DO

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:09.089
YOU AGREE OR DO YOU NOT AGREE

01:37:09.156 --> 01:37:13.494
BASED ON YOUR WORK. THAT

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:14.461
REGULATORY OVERSIGHT EDUCATION

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:17.231
TAXATION WOULDN'T BE A GOOD

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:20.134
DIRECTION TO GO FOR. THE SIX

01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:22.303
JUST AS WE'VE DONE WITH

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:22.870
TRADITION TOBACCO OR DO YOU

01:37:22.937 --> 01:37:25.172
SHARE THE VIEW. THAT WE ARE YOU

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:26.774
SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DO

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.776
MORE OF A PROHIBITION STYLE A

01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:38.919
BAN ON PRODUCTS. THE SPORT.

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:39.453
THAT WAS. JUST THAT WAS A

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.054
SOFTBALL QUESTION BECAUSE YOU

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:46.927
WERE. I CAN WRITE. WELL I THINK

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:48.462
THIS IS A PERSONALLY AND I'M

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:50.030
JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I MEAN

01:37:50.097 --> 01:37:51.398
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING I

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:53.367
MEAN PEIPING IS SO NEW ALL

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:54.568
THESE HEALTH EFFECTS AND HEALTH

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:56.670
HARMS ARE JUST GROWING WE HAVE

01:37:56.737 --> 01:37:59.173
TO LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE OPTION

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.775
I MEAN FOR SURE. TO CONTROL AT

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:04.511
WHATEVER WE CAN IS MOST

01:38:04.578 --> 01:38:05.012
IMPORTANT. I THINK WE'RE

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:08.282
LEARNING EVEN. TWO ONE BUT- YOU

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:08.916
KNOW AS A PROVIDER THE OPIATE

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:11.018
EPIDEMIC IS VERY MUCH ON ALL OF

01:38:11.085 --> 01:38:12.086
OUR MINDS AND THIS IS SOMETHING

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:14.121
WE ARE TASKED VERY HEAVILY TO

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:16.223
DO. AND THAT WAS UNDER A

01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:17.324
MEDICAL MODEL AND NOT A MARKET

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:20.661
MODEL. SO EVEN THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:22.162
KNOW THAT THERE ARE ADDICTION

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:23.530
IS A VERY CHALLENGING THING

01:38:23.597 --> 01:38:24.965
THAT PEOPLE GET FROM MANY

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:27.301
DIFFERENT SOURCES AND A

01:38:27.368 --> 01:38:27.901
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS VERY

01:38:27.968 --> 01:38:32.539
MUCH NEEDED. AND I WOULD SAY

01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:35.342
THE SAME. IN REGARDS TO. THE

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:37.578
TYPE OF WORK THAT'S BEING DONE

01:38:37.645 --> 01:38:40.514
AND WE KNOW AND WE LOOK BACK TO

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:41.415
TWO THOUSAND NINE WE KNOW THAT

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:42.883
WHEN WE REMOVE FLAVORS FROM

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:45.552
CIGARETTES. HEARING CALIFORNIA

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:47.321
EVERY POPULATION HOW TO

01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:48.856
DECREASE IN CIGARETTE

01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:50.758
CONSUMPTION WITH THE EXCEPTION

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:51.358
OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:52.259
THE HIGHEST RATES OF MONTHLY

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:54.595
DID USE. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE

01:38:54.662 --> 01:38:55.095
IS A POSITIVE IMPACT BY

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:56.330
REMOVING THOSE FLAVORED

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:58.599
PRODUCTS. AND SO I CAN ONLY BE

01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:00.200
ASSUMES THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:01.568
THE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES AND I

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:03.137
AGREE WITH DOCTOR WOULD THAT WE

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:05.205
HAVE AN ISSUE HAVE YOU FACING.

01:39:05.272 --> 01:39:07.007
AND I INCREASING AND THEN WE

01:39:07.074 --> 01:39:08.275
HAVE THE ISSUE OF THE

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:10.077
ILLNESSES. BUT LOOKING

01:39:10.144 --> 01:39:11.312
SPECIFICALLY AT THE U. FACING

01:39:11.378 --> 01:39:15.215
SIDE THAT. REMOVING YOU

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:16.784
FRIENDLY PRODUCTS AND FLAVORED

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:17.418
PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET. WHAT

01:39:17.484 --> 01:39:20.254
HAPPENED. ON YOUTH USE OF THE

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:24.224
PRODUCTS AND EVENTUALLY. THEIR

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:29.396
TRANSITION TO OTHER TOBACCO

01:39:29.463 --> 01:39:29.963
PRODUCTS DOWN THE ROAD WHICH

01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:33.934
WHAT THE RESEARCH IS SHOWING US.

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:34.535
I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT. IS

01:39:34.601 --> 01:39:36.136
WHY WE- DESIGNED THE BILL THAT

01:39:36.203 --> 01:39:36.670
WE ARE WORKING ON. SELECT

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:37.938
TOBACCO EXACTLY WHICH IS

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:40.040
BANNING FLAVORS OUTSIDE OF

01:39:40.107 --> 01:39:41.375
TRADITIONAL TOBACCO FLAVORS

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:41.875
MENTAL AND INTERNATIONAL

01:39:41.942 --> 01:39:45.279
TOBACCO. SOME THAT DID WORK IN

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:47.414
SEEMS LIKE COULD WORK AGAIN THE

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:48.649
OTHER EFFORTS ON FLAVORS. ARE

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:49.216
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU JUST

01:39:49.283 --> 01:39:52.453
DESCRIBED. THE OTHER QUESTION I

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:54.922
HAD. IS AVAILABILITY AND

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:57.524
POPULARITY OF NICORETTE. YES

01:39:57.591 --> 01:39:58.826
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WHEN

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:00.928
I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THE

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:02.629
CIGARETTE OF A PICKUP TRUCK I

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:06.266
WENT AND WANTED TO SEE ALL OF

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:07.301
THESE CRAZY FLAVORS RIGHT AYE

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:09.269
CAPTAIN CRUNCH AND BUBBLE GUM

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:13.173
THIS AND ICE CREAM THAT. AND SO

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:16.477
I WENT TO THE JEWEL WEBSITE.

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:19.213
START LOOKING THEY FIND ANY OF.

01:40:19.279 --> 01:40:19.980
I HAD BEEN TOLD OTHERS ALWAYS

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:21.315
CRAZY YOU KNOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:22.015
FOR EVER SINCE I WON THE

01:40:22.082 --> 01:40:27.121
WEBSITE AND FOUND FRUIT MEANT.

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:29.022
AND SEVERAL OTHERS RIGHT AND I

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:29.523
LOOKED AT A COUPLE OTHER

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:31.859
COMPANY WEBSITES AND FOUND

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:34.895
SIMILAR. SIMILAR RESULTS. WHAT

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:36.764
STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT IS I WAS

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:38.899
FAMILIAR THROUGH SOME FRIENDS

01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:39.833
AND FAMILY WITH FOLKS WHO HAD

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:44.138
USE NICORETTE THE PAST. AND IT

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:44.772
STRUCK ME THERE WERE SIMILAR OF

01:40:44.838 --> 01:40:48.175
NICORETTE FLAVORS. AND I WAS

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:49.109
RIGHT THERE'S A TYPE OF FRUIT

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:50.744
MEANT SAME TYPES OF FLAVORS

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:51.278
THAT WERE OFFERED IN THESE

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:54.982
PRODUCTS. WHY NOT SEE AN

01:40:55.048 --> 01:40:57.551
EPIDEMIC OF NICORETTE USE.

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:59.987
AMONG STATES IF IN FACT JUST

01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:01.555
BEING LOGICALLY CONSISTENT THE

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:04.491
FLAVORS DRIVE CONSUMPTION TEENS

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.427
THAT I WOULD ASSUME WE SHOULD

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:09.229
NEVER NICORETTE EPIDEMIC. AND I

01:41:09.296 --> 01:41:13.133
DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE. THAT'S

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.235
ON THE DOCTOR. SURE SO USUALLY.

01:41:15.302 --> 01:41:16.270
NICOTINE GUM OR LOZENGE IS

01:41:16.336 --> 01:41:18.005
USUALLY TWO MILLIGRAMS OF

01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:20.374
NICOTINE WE'RE TALKING THESE

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:22.176
TOOL PARTS THAT THE

01:41:22.242 --> 01:41:23.644
MANUFACTURER SAYS HAS LIKE

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:25.913
FIFTY SIX MILLIGRAMS. AND

01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:27.915
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:29.750
EQUIVALENT OF AT LEAST ONE PACK

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:31.585
OF CIGARETTES SO WHEN YOU'RE

01:41:31.652 --> 01:41:34.121
HAVING FLAVORS FLAVORS IS JUST

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:35.489
ONE PART OF THE MARKETING AND

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:38.325
IT'S ALSO THE TASTE THAT MASKS.

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:40.894
MAYBE WHATEVER BITTERNESS EVEN

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:43.030
IN NYC NICOTINE GUM OR LOZENGE

01:41:43.096 --> 01:41:43.864
YOU KNOW PATIENTS SAY THEY'RE

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.332
SOME PEPPERY TASTE THAT BOTHERS

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:48.735
THEM IN THE MIDST NOMS IT AND

01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:51.104
MASKS THAT SO. I THINK WE'RE

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:53.006
TALK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TAUGHT

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:54.274
AT THE HIGH POTENCY NICOTINE

01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:57.377
PLUS. THE FLAVOR THEY PEEL OF

01:41:57.444 --> 01:42:00.147
FLAVORAND THAT IN THE NATION I

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:05.819
THINK IS SOMETHING. THAT'S WAY

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:06.386
DIFFERENT FROM THESE VAPING

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:11.692
PRODUCTS THAT AND WITH. THE

01:42:11.758 --> 01:42:20.267
MESSAGE THAT THE F. A. OVERSEAS.

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:21.969
GREECE AND YOUTH USE OF MONTHLY

01:42:22.035 --> 01:42:23.737
THAT BIG CAN DEVICES AND MEANT

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:26.673
BABY DEVICES. AND A DECREASE IN

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.408
FRUITS AND CAN BE A

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:29.676
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SO WE ARE

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:31.245
GETTING TO A POINT WHERE YOUNG

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:34.181
PEOPLE. ARE SWITCHING TO MEN'S

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.716
WERE STARTING WITH MINT

01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:38.218
PRODUCTS. I'M ON THE NECK RIGHT

01:42:38.285 --> 01:42:39.453
SIDE ZIPPER SHOULD ABOUT BABY

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.854
PRODUCTS NOT AT NOT G

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:42.623
RRECT SO ON THAT ON THE G

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:45.792
DE. SO IT IS THERE IS NO

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:47.828
STANDARD FOR USE OF NICOTINE

01:42:47.895 --> 01:42:49.930
REPLACEMENT THERAPY PRODUCTS

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:51.798
FOR USE WITH MINORS. THOSE

01:42:51.865 --> 01:42:53.567
PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED TO MINORS

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:54.902
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT JEWEL

01:42:54.968 --> 01:42:56.637
WHO I THINK WE CAN CALL HIM HOW

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:58.338
WORK ON THEIR CURRENTLY AGAIN

01:42:58.405 --> 01:42:59.873
UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR THE

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.341
PRACTICES OF THE MARKETING THAT

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:02.609
THEY DID DO TO YOUTH

01:43:02.676 --> 01:43:04.912
SPECIFICALLY. AND SO THAT'S A

01:43:04.978 --> 01:43:07.314
HUGE DIFFERENCE IS THAT I'M

01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:09.383
ACCESS TO THESE PRODUCTS

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:10.250
THEY'RE A LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE

01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:12.586
TO YOU FAN G

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:14.688
OMOTED BY PROVIDERS AND THEN

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:16.590
ALSO THE INVASIVE MARKETING OF

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:21.361
THESE NEW DEVICES. ON SOCIAL

01:43:21.428 --> 01:43:21.995
MEDIA SITES AND SPECIFICALLY TO

01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:25.999
YOU. SO THERE MIGHT POINT IS

01:43:26.066 --> 01:43:26.500
BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:27.634
RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETING

01:43:27.701 --> 01:43:29.303
EDUCATION TAXATION INCREASED

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:31.171
OVERSIGHT AND PENALTIES ALL

01:43:31.238 --> 01:43:31.772
THOSE THINGS THAT MIGHT. DIAL

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:34.508
IN ON. ACCESSING THOSE PRODUCTS

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:36.476
MAKE IT MORE SIMILAR TO A

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:38.912
NICORETTE PRODUCT THAT'S MORE

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:42.816
RESTRICTIVE. ITS AVAILABILITY

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:44.051
WOULD ALSO ARE JUST TO FOLLOW

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.452
UP ON YOUR THOUGHT DOCTOR

01:43:45.519 --> 01:43:47.254
BRINGS UP AND WE DID NOT

01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:48.555
DISCUSS THIS AT LEAST NOT THAT

01:43:48.622 --> 01:43:50.490
I'M AWARE OF AND- PERHAPS SOME

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:52.125
OTHER CHURCH MEMBERS DID

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:55.562
DISCUSS IT. WAS THE- FOCUSING

01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:58.065
ON THE NICOTINE CONTENT WHICH I

01:43:58.131 --> 01:43:59.199
THINK YOU KNOW YOU BRING UP

01:43:59.266 --> 01:44:00.167
THIS KIND OF EXCESSIVE NICOTINE

01:44:00.233 --> 01:44:01.835
CONTENT MAY BE WITH ME WE NEED

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:04.571
TO FOCUS TAXATION. MORATORIUM

01:44:04.638 --> 01:44:07.608
PROHIBITION PROVISIONS ON

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:08.508
EXACTLY ON THE AMOUNT OF

01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:10.143
NICOTINE CONTAINED IN A PRODUCT

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.478
THAT SOME WE HAVE LOOKED AT

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:13.580
BUT- DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:15.916
AN EFFECTIVE AVENUE TO GO DOWN.

01:44:15.983 --> 01:44:17.985
I THINK THAT'S WORTH EXPLORING

01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:24.491
ON THE E. LIQUIDS AND TRYING.

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:25.058
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THEM

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:28.595
AND ALSO. YOU KNOW WE KNOW

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:29.796
PEOPLE ARE PRICE RESPONSIVE SO

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:31.031
THAT AS- WITH THE CLOSEST WE

01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:33.000
GOT THAT I KNOW THE BILL THAT I

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:33.467
WAS WORKING ON SOME MY

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:34.034
COLLEAGUES WE WERE WE WERE.

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:36.069
LOOKING AT A TAXATION APPROACH

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:38.005
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BASED OFF.

01:44:38.071 --> 01:44:39.706
OF THE NICOTINE. CONTENT IN THE

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:43.010
PRODUCT. SO GO BACK AND TAKE

01:44:43.076 --> 01:44:44.978
ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT. BASED ON

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:48.615
YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY. I

01:44:48.682 --> 01:44:51.118
THINK ALSO AT JUST TO NOTE JUST

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:52.152
LIKE WITH THE TAR YOU KNOW

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:53.620
WHATEVER'S REGISTERING IN THE

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:54.855
MACHINE WE STILL NEED TO LEARN

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:56.857
WHAT'S ACTUALLY. GOING ON WITH

01:44:56.923 --> 01:45:00.994
THE HUMANS AS WELL. IN MY FINAL

01:45:01.061 --> 01:45:02.329
MY FINAL QUESTION I WAS SURE I

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:03.497
HEARD YOUR ANSWERS ON

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:06.566
PROHIBITION. YOUR FOR A

01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:08.502
PROHIBITION OR BAND VERSUS

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:09.569
REGULAR REGULATION OVERSIGHT

01:45:09.636 --> 01:45:12.339
TAXES I CAN LAY THAT OUT THERE

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:13.473
AND I DIDN'T HEAR YOU GUYS.

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:16.276
ANSWER THAT. AS A PROVIDER I'M

01:45:16.343 --> 01:45:17.644
NOT SURE THAT'S USUALLY MY

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:19.813
REALM. AND I'M HERE TO EDUCATE

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:20.280
ABOUT THEIR QUESTION

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:22.382
LEGISLATURE'S ON YOUR YOU KNOW

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:23.150
OPINION GIVEN YOUR INVOLVED

01:45:23.216 --> 01:45:26.219
WITH ALL WELL I THINK TIME IS

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:27.654
TELLING THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:31.358
NOT SAFE AND SO IT'S WORTH.

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:34.528
LOOKING AT EVERY ANGLE. THAT

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:35.128
WE'RE UNDERSTANDING BEES BUT

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:36.163
THE VAPING US A PULMONARY

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.763
INJURY WE STILL HAVE A LOT TO

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:40.434
LEARN THAT. YOU KNOW IF THE CDC

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.236
IS SAYING TO STOP APING. YOU

01:45:43.303 --> 01:45:46.239
KNOW WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS SO. I

01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:48.075
DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S CALLED

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:49.543
PROHIBITION BUT I THINK IT'S

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:51.545
CALLED. HOW DO WE ACT FOR

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:53.413
PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:58.452
YOUR TIME. THANK YOU WHAT THANK

01:45:58.518 --> 01:46:00.120
YOU VERY MUCH FEW QUESTIONS

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:04.691
FOLLOW UP. I JUST WANT

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:08.195
COMMENTED COMMENT AND. MISTER

01:46:08.261 --> 01:46:09.663
GRANT I AGREE AND DISAGREE ON

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:12.699
THINGS AND SO AT THAT MAY OR

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:14.534
MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS PEOPLE SAID.

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:16.236
THAT'S OKAY BUT- BUT- HE POINT

01:46:16.303 --> 01:46:17.270
OUT THAT YOU KNOW WE TALKED

01:46:17.337 --> 01:46:20.440
ABOUT BANNING THE FOURTEEN

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:21.007
THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY

01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:21.775
SEVEN FLAVORS AND STILL LEAVING

01:46:21.842 --> 01:46:23.210
OTHERS OUT THERE. BUT MY

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:25.112
UNDERSTANDING FROM TOBACCO FREE

01:46:25.178 --> 01:46:25.679
KIDS IS THAT WHEN YOU LEAVE

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:27.881
MEANT AND MENTAL ON THE TABLE.

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:30.617
YOU STILL GOT FIFTY PERCENT.

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:32.152
THAT'S THE PREFERENCE 450% OF

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:36.056
USERS SO THAT'S TO ME IS A IS

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:40.694
KIND OF A PROBLEM AND SO. AND

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:42.429
THAT'S THAT'S DATA THAT WAS

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:43.797
FAIRLY DECENT I CAME OUT IN

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:45.599
AUGUST PLEASE SO. THANK MEANT

01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:49.536
WAS SOME. AND HE HAD MENTAL IN

01:46:49.603 --> 01:46:50.971
THERE AND THE NUMBER STILL HIGH

01:46:51.037 --> 01:46:52.038
SO IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S WHY

01:46:52.105 --> 01:46:53.607
RULE THAT'S WHY MISTER CARTY

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:56.042
NINE PARTICULAR LOOKING AT A

01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:58.378
BAN ON ALL FLAVORS BUT SO BUT-

01:46:58.445 --> 01:46:59.846
TALKING ABOUT THE FTA AND

01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:02.549
SAFETY AND PENSION T. CORPSE OR

01:47:02.616 --> 01:47:04.985
TWO COURSES THAT THE COURSE. IT

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:07.988
SEEMS KIND OF COUNTER INTO IT

01:47:08.054 --> 01:47:08.789
SEEMS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IT

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:10.590
SEEMS WRONG THAT WOULD PUT

01:47:10.657 --> 01:47:13.059
PASSED THE INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE

01:47:13.126 --> 01:47:15.128
US WITH SAFETY DATA

01:47:15.195 --> 01:47:20.967
CONSIDERING. THE HISTORY OF THE

01:47:21.034 --> 01:47:23.069
INDUSTRY AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN

01:47:23.136 --> 01:47:28.642
SENT ON TO GO THROUGHOUT TIME.

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:33.079
TO THAT BEEN OUT THERE SO. FAIL

01:47:33.146 --> 01:47:34.548
TO SEE WHY. YES YOU HAVE DAYS

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:35.582
PUSHING THAT UP BUT HOW DO WE

01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:36.583
GET OTHER DATA OUT THERE THAT

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:38.585
ISN'T POTENTIALLY BUYS IT FEELS

01:47:38.652 --> 01:47:39.219
A LITTLE LIKE THE FOX GUARDING

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:40.220
THE HEN HOUSE QUITE FRANKLY.

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:41.788
AND IT JUST FEELS BACKWARDS

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:43.356
ESPECIALLY IN THIS ERA. WITH A

01:47:43.423 --> 01:47:46.159
HISTORY OF NOT BEING TRUTHFUL

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:48.862
ON ON ISSUES WHY WOULD WE THEN.

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:50.330
TAKE THE SAME PEOPLE AND HAVE

01:47:50.397 --> 01:47:54.201
THEM. HAVE THEM YOU KNOW

01:47:54.267 --> 01:47:54.801
CONDUCT THE RESEARCH AND THAT

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:56.203
THEY YOU KNOW. THIS IS THIS IS

01:47:56.269 --> 01:47:58.672
SAFE. YES WELL THERE ARE A LOT

01:47:58.738 --> 01:47:59.573
OF CONTRADICTIONS IN THE

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.441
HISTORY OF TOBACCO CONTROL AND

01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:03.243
I THINK WORD THIS WHOLE VAPING

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:05.912
EPIDEMIC IS MAKING US TRY TO

01:48:05.979 --> 01:48:09.416
EXAMINE EVERYTHING FROM OF.

01:48:09.482 --> 01:48:10.016
FROM UP WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:12.752
WE'RE SEEING NOW. I JUST WANT

01:48:12.819 --> 01:48:14.521
TO POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE

01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:17.924
T. CORES ARE. VERY CAN SERVE AS

01:48:17.991 --> 01:48:19.159
IN TERMS OF INDEPENDENT REVIEWS

01:48:19.226 --> 01:48:22.462
SO I'VE HAD COLLEAGUES AT UC

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:23.730
SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THERE'S A

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:25.932
NEW PRODUCT THAT. CALLED I

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:28.201
COAST THAT IS THE HEAT NOT BURN

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:29.469
PRODUCT IT'S NOT VAPING IT'S

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:31.605
HEATING AND THEY JUST GOT FTA

01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:33.373
THEY SUBMITTED THROUGH THE FDA

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.675
APPROVAL TO MARKET. AND THE

01:48:35.742 --> 01:48:37.544
FOLKS AT THESE CENTERS LOOKED

01:48:37.611 --> 01:48:40.313
AT THE DATA INDEPENDENTLY AND

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.248
CAME TO SOME DIFFERENT

01:48:41.314 --> 01:48:43.216
CONCLUSIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:44.584
PRODUCT. THAT HE'S NOT BURNS

01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:46.720
TOBACCO VERSES REGULAR

01:48:46.786 --> 01:48:48.388
CIGARETTES WHEN THEY LOOKED AT

01:48:48.455 --> 01:48:50.056
THE INDUSTRY DATA THEY SHOWED.

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:54.961
THERE WAS ACTUALLY. TWO HUNDRED

01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:57.664
A 1000% HIGHER. OF OVER FIFTY

01:48:57.731 --> 01:48:58.498
CONSTITUENCIES OUT OF A HUNDRED

01:48:58.565 --> 01:48:59.900
CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS IN THIS

01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:01.101
HEAT NOT BURN PRODUCT COMPARED

01:49:01.167 --> 01:49:02.469
TO REGULAR CIGARETTES AND EVEN

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:04.804
HIGHER. LIVER FUNCTION TESTS

01:49:04.871 --> 01:49:07.440
LIVER INFLAMMATION FROM BLOOD

01:49:07.507 --> 01:49:08.475
TESTS THAN REGULAR CIGARETTES

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:11.244
SO. I THINK. THESE TWO COURSES

01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:12.779
THAT ARE HELP TO THAT ARE

01:49:12.846 --> 01:49:15.215
HELPING THE FTA UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:16.650
IS IMPORTANT DATA FOR

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:18.285
REGULATORY SCIENCE PLAY VERY

01:49:18.351 --> 01:49:20.186
CRITICAL ROLES. BUT THEY ARE

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:22.489
NOT INDUSTRY THEY'RE TYPICALLY

01:49:22.555 --> 01:49:24.691
UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE PROVIDING

01:49:24.758 --> 01:49:29.162
DATA AND ALSO CAN HELP WITH

01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.763
INDEPENDENT. REVIEW OF DATA AS

01:49:29.829 --> 01:49:35.168
WELL. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I-DO HAVE SOME OTHER COMMENTS AND

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:36.670
ALL AND ALL MONEY HIT ON THEM

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:38.805
BUT BUT I KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT

01:49:38.872 --> 01:49:40.640
A BIG AGENDA AHEAD OF US HERE

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:41.775
THANK YOU WITH REGARDS TO

01:49:41.841 --> 01:49:43.777
MISTER LOS TALK ABOUT THAT

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:45.512
REALLY A SMALL NUMBER OF CITIES

01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:47.180
AND THAT HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:49.049
ACTION IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF

01:49:49.115 --> 01:49:52.218
TIME THE FACT IT. ALMOST 10% OF

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:52.752
CALIFORNIA CITIES. IN SOME

01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:54.988
ACTION ON. THANK YOU

01:49:55.055 --> 01:49:55.522
SIGNIFICANT I THINK YOU'RE

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:56.923
GONNA SEE THAT NUMBER GROW. IF

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:58.024
THERE IS AN ACTION FOR ME THE

01:49:58.091 --> 01:49:59.793
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE

01:49:59.859 --> 01:50:02.696
SO I THINK PART OF THAT IS JUST

01:50:02.762 --> 01:50:03.797
PEOPLE SAY WHAT WE GOT A

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:04.998
PROBLEM HERE WE NEED TO DO

01:50:05.065 --> 01:50:06.533
SOMETHING AND MAYBE IT'S NOT

01:50:06.599 --> 01:50:07.667
THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT IT'S

01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:08.468
BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING AT

01:50:08.535 --> 01:50:11.104
ALL AND SO I THINK THAT THAT

01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:12.138
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND

01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:14.441
MORE OF THAT HI TO HEAR THAT IS

01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:15.742
LIKE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:17.644
SCHOOL BAKING. AND IT ISN'T

01:50:17.711 --> 01:50:18.745
DISTINGUISH REMAKING TOBACCO

01:50:18.812 --> 01:50:20.880
INVADING CANNABIS IT'S A BABY

01:50:20.947 --> 01:50:22.816
IT'S ALL LUMPED TOGETHER IS THE

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.117
NUMBER IT IS THE NUMBER ONE

01:50:24.184 --> 01:50:25.885
ISSUE I HEAR FROM FROM PEOPLE.

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:26.987
WE HAVE DONE A MARVELOUS JOB ON

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:28.955
EDUCATION RELATED TOBACCO I

01:50:29.022 --> 01:50:30.423
THINK IT SHOWS BYTHE NUMBER OF

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:34.794
THE PERCENTAGE AND HOW THAT CAN

01:50:34.861 --> 01:50:35.395
OF ACTUAL TRADITIONAL TOBACCO

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:38.131
USE AND CONTINUE TO GO DOWN.

01:50:38.198 --> 01:50:39.432
THE START CHANGE BETWEEN TWO

01:50:39.499 --> 01:50:39.933
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND-

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:40.500
EIGHTEEN AND THEN NOW INTO

01:50:40.567 --> 01:50:42.369
NINETEEN. I GOTTA WONDER IF IT

01:50:42.435 --> 01:50:43.203
ISN'T JUST BECAUSE OF THE

01:50:43.269 --> 01:50:44.437
TRENDY LITTLE DEVICE. THOSE

01:50:44.504 --> 01:50:45.739
ORIGINAL DEVICES WERE PRETTY.

01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:48.675
KEY AND BIG. AND HARD TO HIDE

01:50:48.742 --> 01:50:50.276
AND- MOM SEE THAT WHAT THE HECK

01:50:50.343 --> 01:50:52.078
IS THIS THING. BUT IT'S HARD

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:53.046
IT'S A MUCH EASIER TO CONCEAL

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.647
SOMETHING LIKE LIKE THE JEWEL

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:57.183
DEVICES AND SO. THAT MAKES IT

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:58.184
COOL AND I WONDER HOW MUCH OF

01:50:58.251 --> 01:51:00.887
THAT IS AN ISSUE. I THINK NOW

01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:03.056
WE'RE ALSO WE ARE HEARING NOW

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:06.726
THAT. THAT IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:08.328
EMERGENCY ALL CALL IT RIGHT NOW

01:51:08.395 --> 01:51:09.996
WITH. THE ILLNESSES THAT ARE

01:51:10.063 --> 01:51:12.298
HAPPENING. KIDS ARE ARE ARE

01:51:12.365 --> 01:51:13.633
TAKING A MORE CAUTIOUS

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:15.568
APPROACH. ABOUT THAT SOME KIDS

01:51:15.635 --> 01:51:17.971
ANYWAY. FEMALES MORE THAN MALES

01:51:18.038 --> 01:51:19.706
BECAUSE I THINK. GUYS THING TO

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:20.840
THINK THEY'RE INVINCIBLE

01:51:20.907 --> 01:51:24.711
PERIOD. AND SO I THINK THAT

01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:26.079
THERE ARE THERE AT THE LEAST.

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:32.919
FOR NEW. STARTS AND THOSE THAT.

01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:33.553
ARE CURRENTLY THERE ARE QUITE A

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:38.458
QUALITY. CONTENT. BECAUSE IT'S

01:51:38.525 --> 01:51:39.125
DICTION IT'S SIMPLE IT'S ALMOST

01:51:39.192 --> 01:51:40.293
IMPOSSIBLE. TO WALK AWAY FROM.

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.261
I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:51:41.327 --> 01:51:41.795
THAT WE FACE IN EDUCATION

01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:42.862
CERTAINLY THE CANNABIS SPACES.

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:43.496
THE PROMISE OF PROSPECTS BEFORE

01:51:43.563 --> 01:51:44.998
WAS REVENUE FOR THAT. AND WE

01:51:45.065 --> 01:51:47.000
HAVE A TIME LAG NOW AND THE

01:51:47.067 --> 01:51:49.502
REVENUE ISN'T WHAT WE EXPECTED

01:51:49.569 --> 01:51:51.404
FROM THE TAXES AND SO WE'RE

01:51:51.471 --> 01:51:53.373
KIND OF. A LITTLE BIT BEHIND

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.008
THE SCENES ON THAT FROM MY

01:51:55.075 --> 01:51:56.142
PERSPECTIVE AND WE ARE PROGRAMS

01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:58.445
EITHER SO MAYBE WE PIGGY BACK

01:51:58.511 --> 01:51:59.879
OFF OF. THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS

01:51:59.946 --> 01:52:01.247
THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:04.384
BUT THE RESOURCES. TO MOVE THAT

01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:05.819
HAVE AND HAVEN'T BEEN IS

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:08.488
AVAILABLE YEAH. IT IS

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:09.355
INTERESTING I HAVE A SON IS NOW

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:12.625
TWENTY THREE HE'S HE SAID AND

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:13.460
THRUST MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH

01:52:13.526 --> 01:52:15.495
SCHOOL. THAT CANNABIS WAS MUCH

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:16.930
MORE ACCESSIBLE AND MUCH MORE

01:52:16.996 --> 01:52:19.532
CONSUMED. AND TOBACCO ONCE AND

01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:21.000
SO THE NUMBERS THAT YOU'RE

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:22.502
TALKING ABOUT USAGE DOESN'T

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:25.371
SURPRISE ME TOO MUCH BASED ON.

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:26.806
THAT AND WHAT I HEAR FROM FROM

01:52:26.873 --> 01:52:29.742
OTHER FROM OTHER PEOPLE SO. IN

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:31.578
IT AS FAR AS TAXATION WHETHER

01:52:31.644 --> 01:52:34.080
WE ARE IF WE ARE TAXING. CAM

01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:36.249
NICOTINE PRODUCTS OR CANNABIS

01:52:36.316 --> 01:52:39.219
PRODUCTS MAYBE EVEN YOU KNOW

01:52:39.285 --> 01:52:39.986
LABELING YOU KNOW DIFFERENT

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:41.621
LABELS AND- YOU KNOW MAYBE WE

01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:43.456
GO AT SOME POINT TO I THINK

01:52:43.523 --> 01:52:44.624
THERE'S A ISN'T THERE SOME SORT

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:46.793
OF A- IS LIKE A STICKER

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.261
SOMETHING ON. TOBACCO PRODUCTS

01:52:48.328 --> 01:52:49.662
ITS STANCE MAYBE GO THAT WAY IT

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:51.598
WITH CANNABIS AT SOME POINT.

01:52:51.664 --> 01:52:53.900
BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP US WITH

01:52:53.967 --> 01:52:55.401
THE ILLICIT MARKET. AND SO THAT

01:52:55.468 --> 01:52:56.936
I THINK IS THAT THAT WILL

01:52:57.003 --> 01:52:58.204
CONTINUE TO BE THAT'LL HELP

01:52:58.271 --> 01:53:00.140
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO

01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:01.774
MARKETS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:53:01.841 --> 01:53:03.276
THAT HELPS US WITH THE OF

01:53:03.343 --> 01:53:04.811
LISTEN MARKET. UNTIL THERE'S A

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:08.114
REPORT SO ANYWAY AS FAR SO IF

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:08.982
YOU WANT TO COMMENT I THREW A

01:53:09.048 --> 01:53:11.885
LOT OUT THERE SORRY. YEAH I WAS

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:14.988
A QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR

01:53:15.054 --> 01:53:16.256
COMING TO HAVE YOU VOTE. SO

01:53:16.322 --> 01:53:17.590
WHEN IT'S ON THE COOL FACTOR OF

01:53:17.657 --> 01:53:18.191
THESE DEVICES CERTAINLY IT'S

01:53:18.258 --> 01:53:19.759
VERY COOL WE WORK WITH YOUNG

01:53:19.826 --> 01:53:21.895
PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED AND

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:23.396
WORKING ON THESE ORDINANCES IN

01:53:23.463 --> 01:53:25.932
THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND

01:53:25.999 --> 01:53:27.534
THEY HAVE COME IN SHARED WITH

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:30.503
US THAT THEY SHY AWAY FROM

01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:31.838
TELLING THEIR PEERS WHAT

01:53:31.905 --> 01:53:33.039
THEY'RE WORKING ON BECAUSE IT'S

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:34.674
NOT COOL TO BE AN ANTI TOBACCO

01:53:34.741 --> 01:53:35.975
PERSON RIGHT NOW BECAUSE BIG

01:53:36.042 --> 01:53:37.744
BEEPING HAS BECOME. THE NORM SO

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.212
THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT THE ISSUE

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:41.080
IS THAT EVEN IF IT WAS JUST A

01:53:41.147 --> 01:53:42.782
CALL TRANSFER A LITTLE BIT IT'S

01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:43.816
A COOL TURN WITH THE HIGHLY

01:53:43.883 --> 01:53:45.752
ADDICTIVE SOLUTION. SO NOW

01:53:45.818 --> 01:53:47.754
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DICTATED SO

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.522
EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT TO USE

01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:50.156
ANYMORE AS YOU'D MENTIONED THIS

01:53:50.223 --> 01:53:52.058
IS AN ADDICTION NOT A HABIT.

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:52.892
AND SO NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:54.027
SOMETHING THAT WAS COOL WHO HAS

01:53:54.093 --> 01:53:55.762
CREATED A NEW GENERATION OF

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:57.330
NICOTINE ADDICTS SO THAT'S A

01:53:57.397 --> 01:53:58.798
BIG ISSUE. THE OTHER THING

01:53:58.865 --> 01:53:59.766
WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT

01:53:59.832 --> 01:54:01.768
THE BEING AS THAT'S THE INTENT

01:54:01.834 --> 01:54:03.670
OF THIS HEARING. BUT ALSO JUST

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:06.239
TO NOTE THAT THE FLAVORS THAT

01:54:06.306 --> 01:54:15.014
WE SAW CIGARETTE SMOKING. GOING

01:54:15.081 --> 01:54:15.615
DOWN OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:20.286
AND MUCH OF. THAT CAN BE A

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:22.422
TRIBUTE TO FTA. AND REMOVING

01:54:22.488 --> 01:54:23.156
THE FLAVORS THAT CAN BE

01:54:23.223 --> 01:54:24.457
ATTRIBUTED TO THE AMAZING WORK

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:24.958
THAT'S HAPPENED HERE IN

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:25.592
CALIFORNIA. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:54:25.658 --> 01:54:26.192
TO KNOW THAT TOBACCO USE OF

01:54:26.259 --> 01:54:27.360
OTHER PRODUCTS WAS NOT CHANGING

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:28.161
OR WAS INCREASING WITH USING

01:54:28.228 --> 01:54:28.928
ADULTS AND THAT'S EITHER FLAVOR

01:54:28.995 --> 01:54:29.629
TOBACCO PRODUCTS. AND

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:30.897
OFTENTIMES YOUNG PEOPLE WILL

01:54:30.964 --> 01:54:31.664
SMOKE THEIR MARIJUANA WITH A

01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:33.099
FLAVORED. CIGAR WRAPPER. AND SO

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:35.101
THEY CONNECTION THERE IS. ALL

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:36.803
OF THE FLAVOR TOBACCO IT'S NOT

01:54:36.869 --> 01:54:38.004
SIMPLY FLAVORED NICOTINE

01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:39.405
SOLUTIONS IT'S AN ISSUE WITH

01:54:39.472 --> 01:54:41.975
YOUNG PEOPLE. IT'S THE

01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:42.475
FLAVORING AND ALL OF THE

01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:47.213
PRODUCTS. SO I'VE SEEN OUR

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:47.780
COMMENTS HAVE DRAWN UP MORE

01:54:47.847 --> 01:54:50.316
QUESTIONS SO. MR MCCARTY AND

01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:52.018
THEN MR RIVAS YEAH AND WHAT THE

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:52.885
FIRST THING ABOUT THE CITY'S I

01:54:52.952 --> 01:54:54.787
JUST WANT TO MENTION DOCTOR

01:54:54.854 --> 01:54:57.223
WHAT IS THERE'S 10% RIGHT NOW

01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:59.225
BUT I WOULD SAY THE POPULATION

01:54:59.292 --> 01:55:00.960
WISE IT'S PROBABLY CLOSE TWENTY

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:02.161
FIVE THIRTY WITH LA SAN

01:55:02.228 --> 01:55:04.163
FRANCISCO LA COUNTY THE CITY OF

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:05.898
LA ON THE VERGE OTHER BIG

01:55:05.965 --> 01:55:08.401
CITIES AND SO. SOME OF THE

01:55:08.468 --> 01:55:09.636
RULES ARE DIFFERENT SO THAT'S

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:11.237
ONE THING LIKE WE SAW WITH A

01:55:11.304 --> 01:55:13.206
PLASTIC BAGS IN MENU LABELLING

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:14.707
OF ALL THESE JURISDICTIONS WITH

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:17.610
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LAWS IT'S

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:18.911
MASK FUSION FOR CONSUMERS AND

01:55:18.978 --> 01:55:20.813
THE INDUSTRY PROBABLY I'M NOT

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.749
LET'S HAVE ONE STATEWIDE A

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:24.951
POLICY WITH AN GET SUPPORT FROM

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:27.520
THE TAX CAN REGULATION. I GET

01:55:27.587 --> 01:55:28.621
WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:55:28.688 --> 01:55:30.423
TERM GRAY BUT THERE'S SOME

01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:31.824
PRODUCTS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:34.160
THERE'S MODERATE USE TAXING

01:55:34.227 --> 01:55:35.628
REGULATION OVERSIGHT MAKES

01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:38.564
SENSE LIKE ALCOHOL MODERATE USE

01:55:38.631 --> 01:55:41.968
WE DON'T TAX IT REGULATES AND

01:55:42.035 --> 01:55:44.404
HAVE HAVE POLICY FOR COCAINE

01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:46.239
HEROIN AND METHAMPHETAMINE

01:55:46.306 --> 01:55:48.574
BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S UNSAFE FOR

01:55:48.641 --> 01:55:50.910
ANY. SET SUBSET OF HUMANS THE

01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:52.745
KIDS ESPECIALLY I THINK THE

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:54.814
SAFETY THING IS THE QUESTION

01:55:54.881 --> 01:55:55.415
HERE AND ONE THING WE HAVEN'T

01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:56.249
TALKED ABOUT YET ASK YOU LAST

01:55:56.316 --> 01:55:59.052
QUESTION HERE. IS THAT THE

01:55:59.118 --> 01:56:00.887
TOBACCO MINOR SETTINGS VERY

01:56:00.953 --> 01:56:01.621
DIFFERENT IN THIS PRODUCT OF

01:56:01.688 --> 01:56:03.323
THE NICOTINE THE HIGH DOSAGE

01:56:03.389 --> 01:56:05.925
HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON YOUNG

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:07.026
PEOPLE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT

01:56:07.093 --> 01:56:09.462
THEY'RE STILL THERE DEPRESSION

01:56:09.529 --> 01:56:11.731
ANXIETY AND BEHAVIORAL ISSUES

01:56:11.798 --> 01:56:12.965
THERE'S ONE YOUNG MAN THAT

01:56:13.032 --> 01:56:14.767
SUING TOOL TALKING ABOUT WHAT

01:56:14.834 --> 01:56:16.269
IT LET LED TO HIS. LIFESTYLE

01:56:16.336 --> 01:56:18.071
CHANGE AND THAT'S A PUBLIC

01:56:18.137 --> 01:56:20.373
HEALTH ISSUE THAT HAS COST UPON

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:22.308
SOCIETY AND HEALTHCARE COSTS

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:23.943
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT PIECE WE

01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:25.845
HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT YET

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:29.048
IS THAT THE IMPACT IT HAS JUST

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:30.683
ON THE ACTUAL YOUNG PEOPLE'S

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:32.218
DID HE MENTION TALK ABOUT THAT

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:34.020
FIRST THING THOUGH. YES SO I

01:56:34.087 --> 01:56:35.288
THINK WHEN THE SURGEON

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:36.389
GENERAL'S TALKING ABOUT THE

01:56:36.456 --> 01:56:39.258
DEVELOPING BRAIN HE'S ALSO

01:56:39.325 --> 01:56:41.327
ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:56:41.394 --> 01:56:43.563
AND I THINK. THAT UP AND IT'S

01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:45.431
GETTIN MARIJUANA'S AND IT'S NOT

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:45.932
TO SAY THE DOES IT'S NOT

01:56:45.998 --> 01:56:53.272
IMPORTANT. FOR OLDER PEOPLE

01:56:53.339 --> 01:56:53.773
IT'S JUST THAT. THIS IS

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:59.312
ESPECIALLY IN. POURTANT FOR THE

01:56:59.379 --> 01:57:00.813
NEXT GENERATION SO. I THINK

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.815
THOSE ARE VERY EXCELLENT POINTS

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:03.549
YOU BRING UP UP THAT IT'S NOT

01:57:03.616 --> 01:57:04.484
JUST WILL HELP THAT. YOU KNOW

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:05.084
THESE PULMONARY INJURY CASES

01:57:05.151 --> 01:57:06.652
ARE. ALARMING BUT THERE'S YOU

01:57:06.719 --> 01:57:07.286
KNOW IT'S THE WHOLE PERSON THAT

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:10.490
WE NEED TO LOOK AT. THANK YOU

01:57:10.556 --> 01:57:13.626
RIVAS YEAH SO I APPRECIATE THE

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:14.394
INFORMATION YOU KNOW I COME

01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:17.230
FROM. PART OF MY TIME THE

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:17.697
ASSEMBLY I WAS SCHOOL

01:57:17.764 --> 01:57:18.698
DISCIPLINE MANAGER SO I SAW THE

01:57:18.765 --> 01:57:19.832
SEVEN EMIC RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES

01:57:19.899 --> 01:57:20.800
I SAW ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING

01:57:20.867 --> 01:57:23.503
YOU KNOW. AND SO I GUESS IS A

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:26.105
VERY COMPLEX ISSUE AND A

01:57:26.172 --> 01:57:27.573
DISCUSSION WE PROBABLY MAKE IT

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:28.941
WORSE BY ALL THE DIALOGUE

01:57:29.008 --> 01:57:29.642
YOU'VE HEARD UP HERE I MEAN

01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:32.178
MORE COMPLEX. BUT CERTAINLY

01:57:32.245 --> 01:57:33.379
SEEMS LIKE A RACING AGAINST THE

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:34.747
CLOCK IT SEEMS LIKE THIS

01:57:34.814 --> 01:57:36.849
EPIDEMIC IS GETTING WORSE DAY

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:38.418
BY DAY AND 'VE BEEN BASED ON

01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:39.419
ALL THIS CONVERSATION UP HERE

PRODUCTS AND SO ON. IT IS ONLY

02:17:16.928 --> 02:17:19.898
SINCE THEN THAT WE'VE BEEN.

02:17:19.965 --> 02:17:22.701
TAXING THOSE VAPING PRODUCTS AS

02:17:22.767 --> 02:17:27.505
OTP OR OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:29.774
WE ESTIMATE THAT LAST YEAR THE

02:17:29.841 --> 02:17:31.610
TAX REVENUE FROM THOSE PROGRAMS

02:17:31.676 --> 02:17:34.145
FROM TO FROM VAPING PRODUCTS

02:17:34.212 --> 02:17:36.514
AMOUNTED TO ABOUT FIFTY SIX

02:17:36.581 --> 02:17:39.284
MILLION DOLLARS STARTING NEXT

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:40.919
YEAR WE WILL HAVE EXACT NUMBERS

02:17:40.986 --> 02:17:43.221
AS WE'RE CHANGING OUR RETURNS.

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:46.057
TO REQUIRE THAT VAPING PRODUCTS

02:17:46.124 --> 02:17:48.093
BE SEPARATELY LISTED ON THE TAX

02:17:48.159 --> 02:17:52.998
RETURNS. THE RATE ON T. P.

02:17:53.064 --> 02:17:54.866
INCLUDING VAPING PRODUCTS IS

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:58.269
SET BASED ON THE TOBACCO THE

02:17:58.336 --> 02:17:59.871
CIGARETTE TAX RATE SO

02:17:59.938 --> 02:18:01.306
CIGARETTES ARE TAXED AT TWO

02:18:01.373 --> 02:18:02.474
DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SEVEN CENTS

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:03.541
PER PACK IN THE STATE OF

02:18:03.608 --> 02:18:06.177
CALIFORNIA NOW STARTED OUT AS

02:18:06.244 --> 02:18:07.145
THREE CENTS BACK IN THE FIFTIES

02:18:07.212 --> 02:18:09.381
AND ROB TO TWO EIGHTY SEVEN.

02:18:09.447 --> 02:18:11.983
WHAT WE DO ANNUALLY IS WE TAKE

02:18:12.050 --> 02:18:12.951
THAT TWO EIGHTY SEVEN AND WE

02:18:13.018 --> 02:18:15.453
ADD FIFTY CENTS TO IT SO YOU'RE

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.055
AT THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY

02:18:17.122 --> 02:18:18.390
SEVEN CENTS PER PACK WE DIVIDE

02:18:18.456 --> 02:18:20.392
THAT BY TWENTY WHICH IS THE

02:18:20.458 --> 02:18:21.426
NUMBER OF CIGARETTES IN A

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:24.496
SINGLE PACK. YOU GET SIXTEEN

02:18:24.562 --> 02:18:27.465
POINT EIGHT FIVE CENTS AND THEN

02:18:27.532 --> 02:18:30.335
WE DIVIDE THAT NUMBER EACH YEAR

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:33.638
BY THE AVERAGE WAITED COST OF A

02:18:33.705 --> 02:18:37.475
SINGLE CIGARETTE. THIS YEAR

02:18:37.542 --> 02:18:39.044
THAT MEANS THAT T. P. INCLUDING

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:40.278
ALL OF THESE TO BACK OF EGG

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:42.614
PRODUCTS. ARE TAXED AT A RATE

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:46.084
OF FIFTY NINE POINT TWO SEVEN

02:18:46.151 --> 02:18:49.754
PERCENT. NOW ONE. CURIOUS THING

02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:51.389
ABOUT THE WAY THE CALIFORNIA

02:18:51.456 --> 02:18:54.059
TAXES ARE SET UP IS THAT THAT

02:18:54.125 --> 02:18:55.460
AVERAGE WILL STILL COST WHICH

02:18:55.527 --> 02:18:56.628
IS THE DENOMINATOR IN THE

02:18:56.695 --> 02:18:58.329
EQUATION. RISES EACH YEAR

02:18:58.396 --> 02:19:00.832
BECAUSE OF INFLATION. WHICH

02:19:00.899 --> 02:19:03.068
MEANS THAT THE TAX RATE ON

02:19:03.134 --> 02:19:05.336
OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS ACTUALLY

02:19:05.403 --> 02:19:11.309
GOES DOWN EACH YEAR. IT IS. TO

02:19:11.376 --> 02:19:14.045
ME A STRANGE OUTCOME BUT WE

02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:17.449
HAVE. ANYWAY IN ADDITION TO

02:19:17.515 --> 02:19:19.484
THAT TAX WE ALSO HAVE THE

02:19:19.551 --> 02:19:20.485
CIGARETTE TOBACCO PRODUCTS

02:19:20.552 --> 02:19:23.054
LICENSING PROGRAM WHICH

02:19:23.121 --> 02:19:26.191
LICENSES ANNUALLY OF ABOUT

02:19:26.257 --> 02:19:27.392
THIRTY ONE THOUSAND RETAILERS

THREE HUNDRED WHOLESALERS AND

02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:30.195
EIGHT HUNDRED DISTRIBUTORS NOW

02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:31.329
ON THE TOBACCO SIDE OF THE

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:34.232
EQUATION. WE ADMINISTER THE

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:35.934
SALES AND USE TAX PROGRAM WHICH

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.368
APPLIES TO THESE TOBACCO SALES

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:39.404
AS WELL AS THE EXCISE TAX AND

02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:41.840
THE CULTIVATION TAX. LAST

02:19:41.906 --> 02:19:43.875
FISCAL YEAR THAT ALL OF THOSE

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:45.243
PROGRAMS TOGETHER BROUGHT IN

02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:47.178
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:19:47.245 --> 02:19:49.147
MILLION DOLLARS AND TO DATE

02:19:49.214 --> 02:19:52.450
SINCE ADULT. LEGAL CANNABIS. OF

02:19:52.517 --> 02:19:54.185
THEY'VE HAVE BROUGHT IN ABOUT

02:19:54.252 --> 02:19:54.686
SIX HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:57.021
MILLION DOLLARS. THE EXCISE TAX

02:19:57.088 --> 02:19:58.389
IS AGAIN A VERY COMPLICATED ONE

02:19:58.456 --> 02:20:02.494
AT THE MOMENT IT'S 15% BASED ON

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:06.064
THE WHOLESALE COST. PLUS AND

02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:08.399
MARK UP RATE THAT CD TFA

02:20:08.466 --> 02:20:09.634
DETERMINES EACH YEAR WHICH IS

02:20:09.701 --> 02:20:12.137
CURRENTLY SET AT 60% SO IT'S

02:20:12.203 --> 02:20:14.506
NOT A 15% ON THE ACTUAL PRICE

02:20:14.572 --> 02:20:16.775
PAID BY THE CONSUMER. IT COULD

02:20:16.841 --> 02:20:19.677
BE MUCH LESS THAN 15% IT COULD

02:20:19.744 --> 02:20:21.446
BE MUCH HIGHER BECAUSE

02:20:21.513 --> 02:20:23.014
OBVIOUSLY MARK UP THE ACTUAL

02:20:23.081 --> 02:20:25.116
MARKUP. VARIES IN TRANSACTIONS

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:28.987
AND THAT. ANYWAY SO THOSE THE

02:20:29.053 --> 02:20:31.656
TAX PROGRAMS WE ADMINISTER. HOW

02:20:31.723 --> 02:20:35.126

ACTUALLY THE TAXES PAID WHEN

OUR INSPECTORS GO IN AND HAVE

THE RETAILERS HAVE TO PROVE TO

ADDITION TO THOSE VISITS OUR

02:22:22.233 --> 02:22:24.002
OUTREACH PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE

02:22:24.068 --> 02:22:25.603
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE

02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:26.704
DEALING WITH WE'VE HAD OUR

02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:28.439
OUTREACH TEAMS AROUND THE STATE

02:22:28.506 --> 02:22:31.876
ALSO DOING CANNABIS VISITS

02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:33.077
THEY'VE DONE ABOUT SEVEN

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:35.346
HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT. SINCE

02:22:35.413 --> 02:22:38.783
JULY AND IN THOSE CASES WE'RE

02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:41.786
ACTUALLY VISITING NOT JUST

02:22:41.853 --> 02:22:42.353
PERMIT HOLDERS WERE VISITING

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:47.292
AND THE. CANNABIS SELLER THAT

02:22:47.358 --> 02:22:48.860
WE CAN FIND AND DUE TO SITES

02:22:48.927 --> 02:22:50.528
LIKE WITH MAPS AND OTHERS.

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:51.362
PEOPLE ARE HIDING THEIR RETAIL

02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:54.432
ACTIVITY. THERE ARE SOME REAL

02:22:54.499 --> 02:22:55.800
CHALLENGES ON BOTH OF THESE

02:22:55.867 --> 02:22:57.635
FRONTS AND I'D LIKE TO JUST

02:22:57.702 --> 02:22:59.537
ADDRESS THOSE VERY BRIEFLY. ON

02:22:59.604 --> 02:23:02.507
THE TOBACCO SIDE. THE LACK OF

02:23:02.573 --> 02:23:06.778
STAMPING. OUTSIDE OF CIGARETTES

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:08.813
IS A CHALLENGE IT'S MUCH EASIER

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:10.315
TO GO INTO A STORE AND SEE

02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:12.317
THAT. ALL THE PRODUCT IS

02:23:12.383 --> 02:23:15.119
STAMPED AND ACTUALLY THE STAMPS

02:23:15.186 --> 02:23:19.390
CONTAIN. INFORMATION OUR

02:23:19.457 --> 02:23:20.992
INSPECTORS HAVE DEVICES WHICH

02:23:21.059 --> 02:23:22.293
ALLOW THEM TO READ THE STAMPS

02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:24.329
AND YOU CAN TELL. WHO THE

02:23:24.395 --> 02:23:26.130
DISTRIBUTOR WAS WHEN IT WAS

02:23:26.197 --> 02:23:28.566
DISTRIBUTED A LOT OF BACKGROUND

02:23:28.633 --> 02:23:31.502
INFORMATION ON. ON EACH OF

02:23:31.569 --> 02:23:35.940
THOSE. STAMPS. ALSO ON THE

02:23:36.007 --> 02:23:38.276
VAPING SIDE. THE TAX RATE. IS

02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:41.045
LOWER I THINK THAN YOU WOULD

02:23:41.112 --> 02:23:44.215
ANTICIPATE. BECAUSE IT BECAUSE

02:23:44.282 --> 02:23:45.249
THE TAXES BASED ON THE

02:23:45.316 --> 02:23:47.318
WHOLESALE COST THE WHOLESALE

02:23:47.385 --> 02:23:49.620
COST OF SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS

02:23:49.687 --> 02:23:54.392
IS. RELATIVELY LOW AND SO IF OF

02:23:54.459 --> 02:23:56.394
APING CARTRIDGE IS THE

02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:57.395
EQUIVALENT OF ONE PACK OF

02:23:57.462 --> 02:23:59.831
CIGARETTES IN MANY INSTANCES

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:02.133
THE TAX ON A BEEPING CARTRIDGE

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:03.868
IS MUCH LESS THAN THE TWO

02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:04.936
DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SEVEN CENTS

02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:08.506
TAX ON A PACK OF CIGARETTES SO

02:24:08.573 --> 02:24:09.073
THAT'S AN ISSUE. WE'RE ALSO

02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:11.442
SEEING IT YOU KNOW THERE'S A-

02:24:11.509 --> 02:24:12.510
VERY THERE'S BOTTOM EASE OF

02:24:12.577 --> 02:24:14.779
MARKET ENTRY IN THE VAPING

02:24:14.846 --> 02:24:20.485
SECTOR. WE'VE SEEN A. PEOPLE

02:24:20.551 --> 02:24:23.588
CAN GO ON LINE ORDER MATERIALS

02:24:23.654 --> 02:24:26.491
FOR THEIR STORES THEY CAN SELL

02:24:26.557 --> 02:24:30.428
THE NICOTINE LIQUID SEPARATELY

02:24:30.495 --> 02:24:33.131
FROM THE OTHER LIQUIDS AND

02:24:33.197 --> 02:24:34.766
PEOPLE CAN MIX THEM AT HOME

02:24:34.832 --> 02:24:36.100
ONLY THE NICOTINE LIQUID IS

02:24:36.167 --> 02:24:38.403
TAXED CURRENTLY NOT ANY OF THE

02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:41.072
OTHER VAPING FLAVORED JUICES IF

02:24:41.139 --> 02:24:42.306
THEY'RE SOLD SEPARATELY ONCE

02:24:42.373 --> 02:24:43.341
THEY'RE COMBINED AND IT'S ALL

02:24:43.408 --> 02:24:46.044
TAX BUT OTHERWISE ONLY THE

02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:51.115
NICOTINE. THE PENALTIES HAVE

02:24:51.182 --> 02:24:54.685
HISTORICALLY BEEN PRETTY LOW

02:24:54.752 --> 02:24:55.720
FOR NON COMPLIANCE THAT

02:24:55.787 --> 02:24:57.388
ACTUALLY GOES ON THE CAñADA

02:24:57.455 --> 02:25:01.292
SIDE AS WELL. OUR INSPECTORS AT

02:25:01.359 --> 02:25:02.860
LEAST ARE OPERATING IN A WORLD

02:25:02.927 --> 02:25:05.663
WHERE THE PENALTIES ARE OFTEN

02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:07.231
MISDEMEANORS WHERE IT'S VERY

02:25:07.298 --> 02:25:09.067
DIFFICULT TO GET LOCAL LAW

02:25:09.133 --> 02:25:09.901
ENFORCEMENT EVEN WANT TO GET

02:25:09.967 --> 02:25:12.437
INVOLVED IN A MISDEMEANOR CASE

02:25:12.503 --> 02:25:14.505
AND THE FINES ARE PRETTY LOW.

IN THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE

02:42:48.859 --> 02:42:53.463
IN THIS STATE. UNFORTUNATELY WE

02:42:53.530 --> 02:42:58.969

02:43:05.308 --> 02:43:06.143
REPEAT TO THE CDC INFORMATION

02:43:06.209 --> 02:43:06.676
THAT YOU'VE HEARD SEVERAL

02:43:06.743 --> 02:43:08.111
TIMES. EXCEPT TO SAY THAT WE

02:43:08.178 --> 02:43:08.712
NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE

02:43:08.778 --> 02:43:11.081

02:49:33.162 --> 02:49:33.696
THEIR THE MONEY THAT GOES WITH

02:49:33.763 --> 02:49:36.232
THAT SO. LITTLE FRUSTRATING

02:49:36.299 --> 02:49:37.166
THAT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH IN THE

02:49:37.233 --> 02:49:37.967
WAY OF ENFORCEMENT TOOLS IT

02:49:38.034 --> 02:49:40.703
SOUNDS LIKE TO. OTHER THAN

02:49:40.770 --> 02:49:42.338
CITATIONS AND MISDEMEANORS

02:49:42.405 --> 02:49:44.040
RICHARD HARDLY EVEN A SLAP ON

02:49:44.107 --> 02:49:47.310
THE WRIST IT FEELS LIKE. I'M

02:49:47.377 --> 02:49:47.877
CERTAIN THAT WAS MORE OF AN

02:49:47.944 --> 02:49:48.478
EDITORIAL COMMENT BUT IF YOU

02:49:48.545 --> 02:49:51.681
HAVEN'T. OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE

02:49:51.748 --> 02:49:54.384
ANY COMMENT ON THAT. SO

02:49:54.450 --> 02:49:55.952
DEPENDING ON THE YOU KNOW WE

02:49:56.019 --> 02:49:57.487
GET MANY COMPLAINTS ON

02:49:57.554 --> 02:49:59.255
UNLICENSED ACTIVITY AND NOW

02:49:59.322 --> 02:50:00.523
ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE MEDIA

02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:02.525
SURROUNDING THE VAPING CRISIS

02:50:02.592 --> 02:50:03.960
WE GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS SO

02:50:04.027 --> 02:50:04.961
WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE

02:50:05.028 --> 02:50:06.829
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:50:06.896 --> 02:50:08.565
AND IF WE FEEL SOMETHING NEEDS

02:50:08.631 --> 02:50:11.467
TO BE TESTED WE ARE WORKING IN

02:50:11.534 --> 02:50:12.068
PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM TO HAVE

02:50:12.135 --> 02:50:15.972
THAT PRODUCT TESTED. WITH

02:50:16.039 --> 02:50:17.140
REGARDS TO THOSE ARE. MISS

02:50:17.206 --> 02:50:19.142
MADURO'S FROM CD TFA. SO AS WE

02:50:19.208 --> 02:50:22.045
TALK ABOUT. THE TAXATION

02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:25.048
TAXATION. THOSE ARE ALSO SORT

02:50:25.114 --> 02:50:26.783
OF A SLAP ON THE WRIST AS WELL

02:50:26.849 --> 02:50:27.817
I THOUGHT. I THOUGHT PEOPLE IN

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:30.153
GENERAL KIND OF FREIGHT. ABOUT

02:50:30.219 --> 02:50:32.522
THE TAX COLLECTORS INFORMER SO.

02:50:32.589 --> 02:50:34.257

ABOUT MY RETURNS AND THINGS.

02:50:36.859 --> 02:50:38.761
BUT I GOT THE IMPRESSION FEELS

02:50:38.828 --> 02:50:39.762
LIKE. THAT MAYBE SOME PEOPLE

02:50:39.829 --> 02:50:41.831
ARE NICE AND SOME IS INDUSTRIE

02:50:41.898 --> 02:50:44.867
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I TO HAVE

02:50:44.934 --> 02:50:45.435
SOMEBODY THREATEN ME WITH A

02:50:45.501 --> 02:50:48.071
MISDEMEANOR AS A- NERDY MIDDLE

02:50:48.137 --> 02:50:51.074
AGED FELLOW WOULD BE. AFRAID

02:50:51.140 --> 02:50:56.179
BUT. ALAS THOSE PEOPLE LEARNING

02:50:56.245 --> 02:50:57.714
LOTS OF MONEY IN THE ILLEGAL

02:50:57.780 --> 02:50:58.715
CANNABIS MARKET DON'T SEEM

02:50:58.781 --> 02:50:59.983
AFRAID AND THAT IN THE TÁI

02:51:00.049 --> 02:51:01.718
HERE TO THE VAPING IN MY MIND

02:51:01.784 --> 02:51:03.987
IS THAT. YOU KNOW I WOULD. THE

02:51:04.053 --> 02:51:05.955
PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING SOLD

02:51:06.022 --> 02:51:07.523
THAT ARE UNTAXED ARE ALSO

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:09.926
UNTESTED RIGHT AND THAT'S THE

02:51:09.993 --> 02:51:12.028
REAL I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE.

02:51:12.095 --> 02:51:12.962
FOR THAT HE'S GOT I THINK

02:51:13.029 --> 02:51:14.364
THAT'S A THAT'S THE KEY CAN I

02:51:14.430 --> 02:51:18.301
DO THINK. I IN MY MIND IT IS

02:51:18.368 --> 02:51:20.536
BOTH THE CRIMINAL SANCTIONS BUT-

02:51:20.603 --> 02:51:21.537
TO BRING A CRIMINAL CASE TAKE

02:51:21.604 --> 02:51:25.008
SO LONG. AND IT'S REALLY

02:51:25.074 --> 02:51:27.043
DIFFICULT WHEN WE'RE- GOT

02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:28.945
THOUSANDS OF THESE IN MY MIND

02:51:29.012 --> 02:51:30.146
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THERE

02:51:30.213 --> 02:51:31.414
NEEDS TO BE THERE NEED TO BE

02:51:31.481 --> 02:51:33.483

PENALTIES. THAT ARE ALLOWED TO

02:51:36.219 --> 02:51:39.589
BE PUT ON VERY QUICKLY AND IF

THEY'RE PUT ON AN AIR PEOPLE

02:51:40.223 --> 02:51:44.661
CAN APPEAL BUT- I JUST. THANK

THAT EVEN GOING TO A FELONY THE

02:51:47.563 --> 02:51:49.699
IS NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THE

02:51:49.766 --> 02:51:52.335
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT

02:51:52.402 --> 02:51:53.936
WILL TAKE SO LONG TO GET

02:51:54.003 --> 02:51:57.140
THROUGH THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL

02:51:57.206 --> 02:51:58.441

TELLING PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE'VE

ELSE. BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO

02:52:16.592 --> 02:52:19.629
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE. BEST

02:52:19.696 --> 02:52:20.229
WEIGHT I MEAN A THEY DO THE

02:52:20.296 --> 02:52:22.598
MONEY TO THE STATE BUT WE NEED

02:52:22.665 --> 02:52:24.100

02:52:24.167 --> 02:52:26.102
TO PROCEED IS AND I'M NOT SURE

02:52:26.169 --> 02:52:29.305
THAT. WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE.

02:52:29.372 --> 02:52:30.973
IS WHAT. WILL WORK IN THIS

02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:34.610
SITUATION. AS I THINK YOU HAVE

02:52:34.677 --> 02:52:36.479
A PRETTY BIG TOOL BELT BUT NOT

02:52:36.546 --> 02:52:39.449
A LOT OF TOOLS. THAT'S ONE WAY

02:52:39.515 --> 02:52:48.024
TO PUT IT. THINKING ALONG ALONG

02:52:48.091 --> 02:52:52.028
THESE LINES IS. AND THIS IS

02:52:52.095 --> 02:52:53.029
MORE A QUESTION FOR THE

THIS IS ABOUT BUT THIS IS

02:52:57.800 --> 02:52:58.901
BRINGING UP SOME OTHER ISSUES

02:52:58.968 --> 02:53:01.337
THAT ARE OF CONCERN I THINK THE

02:53:01.404 --> 02:53:01.871
CHAIRMAN GRAY AND I WERE

02:53:01.938 --> 02:53:03.506
COMMENTING TO GET TOGETHER

02:53:03.573 --> 02:53:06.409
TWENTY TWO MONTHS INTO THIS AND

02:53:06.476 --> 02:53:08.978
WE HAVE 80% OF THE MARKET

02:53:09.045 --> 02:53:11.848
UNLICENSED. IS PRETTY APPALLING

02:53:11.914 --> 02:53:13.483
AND IT'S ROOM IN IT I WOULD

02:53:13.549 --> 02:53:14.617
IMAGINE FOR THOSE PEOPLE IN THE

02:53:14.684 --> 02:53:18.087
LICENSE MARKET IT'S PRETTY IT'S

02:53:18.154 --> 02:53:19.722
PRETTY FRUSTRATING EXTREMELY

02:53:19.789 --> 02:53:21.457
FRUSTRATING TO KNOW THAT

02:53:21.524 --> 02:53:22.291
THEY'RE PLAYING BY THE RULES

02:53:22.358 --> 02:53:23.626
AND WE'VE GOT THIS AND I

02:53:23.693 --> 02:53:25.161
UNDERSTAND IT AND IT FEELS LIKE

02:53:25.228 --> 02:53:27.063
ALL OF YOU HAVE TOOL BELTS AND

02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:29.098
NOT ENOUGH TOOLS AND NONE OF

02:53:29.165 --> 02:53:31.067
RESOURCES IT'S A BY THE TOOLS.

02:53:31.134 --> 02:53:32.935
AND SO ON SO IT IS A CHALLENGE

02:53:33.002 --> 02:53:35.204
SO I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION AND

02:53:35.271 --> 02:53:38.307
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER AND SO

02:53:38.374 --> 02:53:41.010
IT BUT I AM CURIOUS AND I DON'T

02:53:41.077 --> 02:53:42.745
KNOW WHAT HOW THIS EQUATES IN

02:53:42.812 --> 02:53:43.679
THE REST OF THE WORLD SOMEONE

02:53:43.746 --> 02:53:46.048
TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION. IF WE

02:53:46.115 --> 02:53:47.717
WERE TO FIND THAT THERE WASAN

02:53:47.784 --> 02:53:50.653
ENTITY OR SOMEONE WHO WAS

02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:53.723
ADDING SOMETHING TO THE VAPING

02:53:53.790 --> 02:53:56.392
LIQUIDS THAT WAS CAUSING THIS

02:53:56.459 --> 02:53:59.929
OUTBREAK. THAT HAS CAUSED GREAT

02:53:59.996 --> 02:54:05.568
BODILY HARM. AND DEATH IN SOME

02:54:05.635 --> 02:54:06.702
CASES. WE'VE TO DECRIMINALIZE

02:54:06.769 --> 02:54:09.338
SO MUCH AROUND CANNABIS. WHAT

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:09.939
WHAT THE RECORDS FOR THE H. E.

02:54:10.006 --> 02:54:10.773
B. WITH THEIR HOW WOULD YOU

02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:12.275
PROSECUTE THAT CASE OR WOULD

02:54:12.341 --> 02:54:12.842
YOU BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE IT

02:54:12.909 --> 02:54:15.344
BASED ON. WHAT IN THE ROLE OF

02:54:15.411 --> 02:54:19.081
THE LAWS UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR.

02:54:19.148 --> 02:54:19.649
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER I'M

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:23.920
JUST AYE BUT I'M CURIOUS. THE

02:54:23.986 --> 02:54:26.122
REASON I SAY THAT I WOULD BET

02:54:26.189 --> 02:54:28.024
THAT IF YOU WERE GROWING

02:54:28.090 --> 02:54:30.993
LETTUCE OR SPINACH SOMEWHERE.

02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:32.261
AND YOU DID SOMETHING IN THE

02:54:32.328 --> 02:54:34.864
ADDED SOMETHING THERE. AND

02:54:34.931 --> 02:54:36.432
PEOPLE DIED ACROSS THE UNITED

02:54:36.499 --> 02:54:38.968
STATES THE YOU'D BE PRETTY

02:54:39.035 --> 02:54:39.502
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND A

02:54:39.569 --> 02:54:42.271
WHOLE NUMBER WAYS SO. IS THIS

02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:44.173
INDUSTRY GOING TO BE THIS HAVE

02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:45.608
THE SAME LEVEL OF

02:54:45.675 --> 02:54:47.343
RESPONSIBILITY AS THE LETTUCE

02:54:47.410 --> 02:54:48.744
INDUSTRY. OR THE SPANISH

02:54:48.811 --> 02:54:51.614
INDUSTRY. OR TYLENOL OR

02:54:51.681 --> 02:54:53.082
ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE BUT

02:54:53.149 --> 02:54:56.085
BECAUSE IT ADDED A PRODUCT TO

02:54:56.152 --> 02:54:56.619
SOMETHING THE CAUSE GREAT

02:54:56.686 --> 02:55:00.823
BODILY HARM AND DEATH. WELL AS

02:55:00.890 --> 02:55:01.891
I INDICATED IF YOU CAN ATTACH A

02:55:01.958 --> 02:55:03.526
CANNABIS VIOLATION TO SOMETHING

02:55:03.593 --> 02:55:04.694
ELSE CAN IT BECOMES A FELONY SO

02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:05.895
I THINK IN THE CASE OF A DEATH

02:55:05.962 --> 02:55:07.597
YOU CAN ATTACH IT TO A

02:55:07.663 --> 02:55:09.432
DIFFERENT LAW THAT WOULD

02:55:09.498 --> 02:55:12.401
CREATE. A FELONY VIOLATION. IT

02:55:12.468 --> 02:55:14.170
WOULD JUST BE A YOU KNOW UP A

02:55:14.237 --> 02:55:16.672
MANUFACTURING CANNABIS

02:55:16.739 --> 02:55:17.840
VIOLATION ANYMORE IT WOULD BE

02:55:17.907 --> 02:55:19.709
SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT.

02:55:19.775 --> 02:55:20.643
THOUGH IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:21.978
SOMEBODY IS SOME AT. SOME

02:55:22.044 --> 02:55:23.946
ENTITIES OR WHATEVER WERE FOUND

02:55:24.013 --> 02:55:25.448
TO BE ADDING SOMETHING THAT

02:55:25.514 --> 02:55:28.484
BECAUSE THIS. WHETHER KNOWINGLY

02:55:28.551 --> 02:55:29.118
OR UNKNOWINGLY I MEAN CREATING

02:55:29.185 --> 02:55:30.887
A PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD. WELL I

02:55:30.953 --> 02:55:33.823
THINK YOU WOULD DIFFERENTIATE

02:55:33.890 --> 02:55:34.490
BETWEEN KNOWINGLY OR

02:55:34.557 --> 02:55:36.926
UNKNOWINGLY ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

02:55:36.993 --> 02:55:38.327
OBVIOUSLY NO THERE ATTY RIGHT

02:55:38.394 --> 02:55:42.565
OUT OF THE CONSEQUENCES. YEAH

02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:43.132
THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES

02:55:43.199 --> 02:55:47.069
ABSOLUTELY. OKAY JUST LIKE IT

02:55:47.136 --> 02:55:49.972
WOULD BE FOR LETTUCE GROWERS.

02:55:50.039 --> 02:55:51.107
WELL OR OR YOU KNOW AT A

02:55:51.173 --> 02:55:53.709
CULTIVATOR WHO USES SAT DEADLY

THEY GET NOW YOU'VE LINKED

TO CORRECT THEY HAVE ABOUT

02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:42.358

THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THE

02:57:54.130 --> 02:57:55.231
FRANKLY THE GRANTS WERE GIVEN

02:57:55.297 --> 02:57:58.134

WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO MY

02:58:01.704 --> 02:58:09.879
IMPRESSION. WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR

02:58:09.945 --> 02:58:11.113
THOUSAND VISITS TO RETAILERS

02:58:13.849 --> 02:58:15.351
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE THREE

02:58:15.418 --> 02:58:15.885

THIRD TIME BY LATER ON AT THE

02:58:24.727 --> 02:58:26.562
LOCAL LEVEL WE REALLY DO MORE

02:58:26.629 --> 02:58:28.064
AND OF THE TRAINING OF LAW

02:58:28.130 --> 02:58:30.666
ENFORCEMENT OF WHAT. THEY WOULD

02:58:30.733 --> 02:58:31.233
DO I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION

02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:34.103
ABOUT WHAT. SPECIFICALLY THE

02:58:34.170 --> 02:58:35.738
NUMBER OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:58:35.805 --> 02:58:36.305
VISITS BUT I CAN TRY AND GET

02:58:36.372 --> 02:58:39.375
THAT FOR YOU. WELL CERTAINLY I

02:58:39.442 --> 02:58:41.544
THINK WE NEED IF YOU DON'T NEED

02:58:41.610 --> 02:58:42.878
TO FIND OUT AND WE NEED TO GIVE

02:58:42.945 --> 02:58:44.480

CONDUCT MORE STING OPERATIONS

02:58:45.681 --> 02:58:47.950
BECAUSE IT'S- AGAIN WE DON'T

02:58:48.017 --> 02:58:49.185
NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL WE

02:58:49.251 --> 02:58:49.752
KNOW THAT WHAT WE DO IN THE

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:51.087
AREA ABOUT COST CONTROL

02:58:51.153 --> 02:58:52.354
EFFECTIVE. LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:58:52.421 --> 02:58:54.723
KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS I THINK

02:58:54.790 --> 02:58:55.491
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE

02:58:55.558 --> 02:58:59.428
HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT ANY NON

02:58:59.495 --> 02:58:59.995
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. BUT

02:59:00.062 --> 02:59:03.632
NONETHELESS. I THINK WE MAKES

02:59:03.699 --> 02:59:04.233
AN IMPROVEMENT THERE BUT I'LL

02:59:04.300 --> 02:59:05.067
BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND

02:59:05.134 --> 02:59:05.668
I'D LIKE SOME FEEDBACK WHEN I

PROVIDE THE LEGISLATION AND-

02:59:07.803 --> 02:59:12.108
WHICH IS WERE TAKING. SECONDLY.

02:59:12.174 --> 02:59:12.708
ACTUALLY YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED

02:59:12.775 --> 02:59:18.314
HOW MANY. LICENSES WERE RIVER

02:59:18.380 --> 02:59:20.483
REMOVED THERE WERE NO LICENSES

02:59:20.549 --> 02:59:22.985
REMOVE THERE IS ONE THAT COULD

02:59:23.052 --> 02:59:24.019
HAVE BEEN REMOVED EXCEPT THAT

02:59:24.086 --> 02:59:26.055
THE BUSINESS SHOT DOWN SO IT

02:59:26.122 --> 02:59:26.655
WAS NO LICENSES REMOVED RIGHT.

02:59:26.722 --> 02:59:29.825
OKAY FROM THE STATE LEVEL I

02:59:29.892 --> 02:59:30.993
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT THE LOCAL

02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:32.928
LEVEL UNDERSTOOD I'M GONNA MOVE

02:59:32.995 --> 02:59:35.631
ON NOW TO APPEAR OF CANNABIS

02:59:35.698 --> 02:59:40.136
CONTROL. I WANT TO BEGIN WITH

02:59:40.202 --> 02:59:44.006
THE FLAVOR ISSUE. I RECENTLY

02:59:44.073 --> 02:59:46.008
VISITED DISPENSARY TO TAKE A

02:59:46.075 --> 02:59:50.012
LOOK AT. A DISPATCHER FROM A

02:59:50.079 --> 02:59:54.950
FLAVOR VIEWPOINT. AND. I'M A GO

02:59:55.017 --> 02:59:55.684
AHEAD AND READ YOU SOME OF THE

02:59:55.751 --> 02:59:57.052
FLAVORS THAT WERE DISPLAYED ON

02:59:57.119 --> 03:00:00.556
THE BOARD OF MARIJUANA BANANA

03:00:00.623 --> 03:00:03.626
SPLIT BLUEBERRY MILKSHAKE

03:00:03.692 --> 03:00:05.661
WEDDING CAKE ICE CREAM CAKE.

03:00:05.728 --> 03:00:09.765
KEY LIME PIE. PUNCH IT BETTER

03:00:09.832 --> 03:00:14.136
BREAST. SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO

03:00:14.203 --> 03:00:16.672
YOUR PERSPECTIVE GIVEN THAT

03:00:16.739 --> 03:00:18.407
FLAVORS ARE A MAJOR CONCERN FOR

03:00:18.474 --> 03:00:21.043
SOME MY COLLEAGUES AS IT

03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:23.979
RELATES TO E. CIGARETTES.

03:00:24.046 --> 03:00:25.281
WHAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE ON THESE

03:00:25.347 --> 03:00:27.449
FLAVORS IF EASTER FLAVORS ARE

03:00:27.516 --> 03:00:29.318
DRIVING TEENAGE CONSUMPTION AND

03:00:29.385 --> 03:00:31.153
AN UNDERAGE CONSUMPTION THAT I

03:00:31.220 --> 03:00:33.889
WOULD ASSUME. THAT IS TRUE WITH

03:00:33.956 --> 03:00:34.423
MARIJUANA BUT ARE THERE NO

03:00:34.490 --> 03:00:40.062
RESTRICTIONS. SO EIGHT A LOT OF

03:00:40.129 --> 03:00:41.564
THOSE COULD BE ALSO STRAINED

03:00:41.630 --> 03:00:43.832
NAMES THAT THEY USE IT'S NOT

03:00:43.899 --> 03:00:46.168
ALWAYS NECESSARILY FLAVORS ON

03:00:46.235 --> 03:00:47.870
THE DO YOU HAVE A CANNABIS

03:00:47.937 --> 03:00:51.106
TERPENES. BUT MOST THE TIME

03:00:51.173 --> 03:00:52.775
WHAT WE SEE THOSE ARE STRAIN

03:00:52.841 --> 03:00:56.145
NAMES AND SO WE DO LOOK AT

03:00:56.212 --> 03:00:56.779
ESPECIALLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT

03:00:56.845 --> 03:00:59.315
OF PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE. YOU KNOW

03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:01.083
ANY PACKAGING CAN'T BE

03:01:01.150 --> 03:01:03.385
ATTRACTED TO CHILDREN ON THE

03:01:03.452 --> 03:01:06.689
CAN ADVERTISE TO CHILDREN BUT

03:01:06.755 --> 03:01:07.456
FOR MOST OF THESE THOSE WOULD

03:01:07.523 --> 03:01:10.859
BE CANNABIS FLOWER WE'RE

03:01:10.926 --> 03:01:13.696
TALKING ABOUT AND SO.

03:01:13.762 --> 03:01:15.030
RESTRICTIONS ON PACKAGING AGAIN

03:01:15.097 --> 03:01:15.531
WOULD BE STILL CAN'T BE

03:01:15.598 --> 03:01:20.135
ATTRACTED TO CHILDREN. NOW

03:01:20.202 --> 03:01:21.003
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE NAMES

03:01:21.070 --> 03:01:23.239
REPRESENT A FLAVOR OR A STRAIN

03:01:23.305 --> 03:01:24.473
I THINK AS FAR AS WE TALK ABOUT

03:01:24.540 --> 03:01:26.508
MARKETING THE NAME OF A PRODUCT

03:01:26.575 --> 03:01:28.877
IS IN FACT MARKETING. AND DOES

03:01:28.944 --> 03:01:30.145
CERTAINLY AT LEAST STRIK ME AT

03:01:30.212 --> 03:01:31.847
FIRST BLUSH AND I'M GONNA TRY

03:01:31.914 --> 03:01:35.184

DIRECTED TOWARDS YOUNG PEOPLE

03:01:36.452 --> 03:01:38.721
OR PERHAPS. PERHAPS NOT MAYBE

03:01:38.787 --> 03:01:39.588
THE FLAVORS AREN'T THE KEY

03:01:39.655 --> 03:01:42.891
ISSUE I'M SURE THEY OPEN THAT

03:01:42.958 --> 03:01:43.492
WE'VE BEEN. DEBATING THAT ALL

03:01:43.559 --> 03:01:47.162

REMOVED THIS PAST TWENTY TWO

03:01:51.700 --> 03:01:55.537
MONTHS. SO MOST OF OUR LICENSES

03:01:55.604 --> 03:01:58.274

03:01:58.340 --> 03:02:01.844

WE WE'VE GOT WE'VE DONE SOME

03:02:15.624 --> 03:02:17.826
SUSPENSIONS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

03:02:17.893 --> 03:02:19.795
FOR A SALES TO MINOR THAT WE

03:02:19.862 --> 03:02:20.529
HAD WITH THE LIVERY OF A

03:02:20.596 --> 03:02:23.399

SAFETY ISSUE THEN WE WILL

03:02:32.574 --> 03:02:34.543

WHAT HURDLES CHALLENGES TOOLS

03:04:09.171 --> 03:04:10.606
ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO

03:04:10.672 --> 03:04:12.908
ACCOMPLISH THAT WELL I DON'T

03:04:12.975 --> 03:04:13.609
THINK WE COULD JUST SORT OF

03:04:13.675 --> 03:04:15.811
LIFT AND SHIFT WITH THE SAME

03:04:15.878 --> 03:04:17.846
TAX STAMPING REGIMEN THAT WE

03:04:17.913 --> 03:04:20.349
HAVE THEIR INTO VAPING FOR A

03:04:20.416 --> 03:04:23.752
FEW REASONS ONE. CIGARETTES ARE

03:04:23.819 --> 03:04:25.921
ALL TAX TO TWO DOLLARS AND

03:04:25.988 --> 03:04:27.089
EIGHTY SEVEN CENTS PER PACK THE

03:04:27.156 --> 03:04:30.793
TAX ON OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

03:04:30.859 --> 03:04:32.394
IS BASED ON THIS WHOLESALE COST

03:04:32.461 --> 03:04:34.430
CALCULATION SO IT'S NOT YOU

03:04:34.496 --> 03:04:35.831
COULDN'T SELL JUST A SINGLE

03:04:35.898 --> 03:04:37.666
VALUE STAMP AND SAY THAT THAT'S

03:04:37.733 --> 03:04:39.868
YOUR STAMP FOR EVERY PRODUCT IF

03:04:39.935 --> 03:04:41.437
YOU WANTED TO BE AN ACTUAL TAX

03:04:41.503 --> 03:04:45.040
STAMP. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT

03:04:45.107 --> 03:04:47.609
THE PACKAGING ON THESE OTHER

03:04:47.676 --> 03:04:50.412
PRODUCTS THE SIZE THE NUMBER OF

03:04:50.479 --> 03:04:52.981
ITEMS CONTAINED IS ALSO NOT THE

03:04:53.048 --> 03:04:54.383
SAME WITH CIGARETTES EVERY

03:04:54.450 --> 03:04:55.584
SINGLE PACKAGE TWENTY

03:04:55.651 --> 03:04:58.120
CIGARETTES. AND THERE ARE

03:04:58.187 --> 03:04:59.488
MACHINES THAT ARE DEVELOPED

03:04:59.555 --> 03:05:01.690
THAT OPEN THE- BOXES AND STAMP

03:05:01.757 --> 03:05:05.761
EVERYTHING. AND IT BECOMES VERY

03:05:05.828 --> 03:05:11.166
EFFICIENT. THAT SAID. THE IN MY

03:05:11.233 --> 03:05:12.234
MIND IS THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR

03:05:12.301 --> 03:05:12.835
THINGS THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED

03:05:12.901 --> 03:05:15.771
YEAR IS TRACING WHERE THE

03:05:15.838 --> 03:05:16.939
PRODUCTS CAME FROM AND ENSURING

03:05:17.005 --> 03:05:19.875
THAT ITS TAX PAID AND INSURING

03:05:19.942 --> 03:05:20.876
THAT IT'S NOT A COUNTERFEIT

03:05:20.943 --> 03:05:23.579
PRODUCT AND THOSE COULD BE

03:05:23.645 --> 03:05:26.215
ACHIEVED WITH WITH A STAMP THAT

03:05:26.281 --> 03:05:27.883
IS REQUIRED THAT IS NOT

03:05:27.950 --> 03:05:31.587
NECESSARILY A STAMP THAT THE

03:05:31.653 --> 03:05:34.356
DISTRIBUTOR BUYS FROM US FOR A

03:05:34.423 --> 03:05:35.224
CERTAIN TAX AMOUNT ALTHOUGH

03:05:35.290 --> 03:05:37.626
THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT YOU WOULD

03:05:37.693 --> 03:05:39.495
HAVE TO HAVE VARYING VALUES SO

03:05:39.561 --> 03:05:40.028
IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:05:40.095 --> 03:05:42.397
COMPLICATED BUT I DO THINK AND

03:05:42.464 --> 03:05:43.432
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

03:05:43.499 --> 03:05:44.900
THE GOVERNOR'S ASKED US TO LOOK

03:05:44.967 --> 03:05:46.668
AT THAT WILL BE REPORTING OUT

03:05:46.735 --> 03:05:48.537
TO HIM. LATER THIS MONTH ON

03:05:48.604 --> 03:05:50.038
THAT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO

03:05:50.105 --> 03:05:52.140
DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT WOULD

03:05:52.207 --> 03:05:52.774
ACCOMPLISH THAT I WILL ALSO SAY

03:05:52.841 --> 03:05:55.944
THAT I BELIEVE. THAT INITIAL

03:05:56.011 --> 03:05:56.945
GETTING THE CIGARETTE TAX TAX

03:05:57.012 --> 03:05:58.247
STEP UP AND RUNNING TOOK I

03:05:58.313 --> 03:06:00.315
THINK THREE YEARS. WHICH IS A

03:06:00.382 --> 03:06:02.618
LONG TIME I'D ALSO LIKE TO COME

03:06:02.684 --> 03:06:03.252
UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WE COULD

03:06:03.318 --> 03:06:05.921
DO MORE QUICKLY. THE DOES THE

03:06:05.988 --> 03:06:07.723

TOBACCO ELEMENT OF THE VEIL I.

03:12:48.890 --> 03:12:50.325
ONE COULD CHANGE THE DEFINITION

03:12:50.392 --> 03:12:52.527
OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO INCLUDE

03:12:52.594 --> 03:12:55.563

PRESUMABLY A FAIRLY ROBUST RATE

03:13:11.046 --> 03:13:12.881

03:13:12.948 --> 03:13:14.115
WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE

03:13:14.182 --> 03:13:15.183
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST TAXING THAT

THAT WE GET THE COMPLAINTS

COMING INTO THE BUREAU IS THE

03:13:38.306 --> 03:13:40.608
LICENSE MARKET AND HOW IT'S

03:13:40.675 --> 03:13:41.176
DIRECTLY COMPETING WITH OUR

03:13:41.242 --> 03:13:44.346

THINK WE'RE STILL LEARNING THE

03:14:12.874 --> 03:14:16.978
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND AGAIN

03:14:17.045 --> 03:14:19.247

03:24:27.622 --> 03:24:28.956
THEIR VAPING PRODUCTS FROM

03:24:29.023 --> 03:24:31.926
ILLICIT STREET VENDORS. POP UP

UNVERIFIED SELLERS AND BY

03:24:37.031 --> 03:24:38.366
UNVERIFIED SELLERS WE MEAN

03:24:38.432 --> 03:24:40.735
RETAILERS THAT EITHER COULD NOT

03:24:40.801 --> 03:24:43.137
BE LOCATED OR COULD NOT BE

03:24:43.204 --> 03:24:46.107
VERIFIED AS HAVING A LICENSE.

03:24:46.173 --> 03:24:47.008
THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATTERNS OF

03:24:47.074 --> 03:24:48.809
LUNG INJURY WHICH ARE EMERGING

03:24:48.876 --> 03:24:50.845
BASED ON THE MEDICAL FINDINGS

03:24:50.911 --> 03:24:53.914
FROM TISSUE BIOPSIES AUTOPSIES

03:24:53.981 --> 03:24:56.050
AND BLOOD WORK. MANY OF THESE

03:24:56.117 --> 03:24:56.651
ARE NOW EMERGING IN PUBLISHED

03:24:56.717 --> 03:24:59.487
LITERATURE. I'M GOING TO LIST A

03:24:59.553 --> 03:25:02.023
FEW THE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF

03:25:02.089 --> 03:25:02.556
IN THE MEDIA EXHAUSTION A

03:25:02.623 --> 03:25:04.925
SLIGHT PUEDEN AMMONIA. THE

03:25:04.992 --> 03:25:06.360
THEORY BEHIND THAT WAS IT AND

03:25:06.427 --> 03:25:08.129
HAILING VAPORIZED OILS CAN

03:25:08.195 --> 03:25:10.431
CAUSE THIS CLINICAL SYNDROME.

03:25:10.498 --> 03:25:12.433
THAT CAN BE SEEN ON SOME OF THE

03:25:12.500 --> 03:25:13.501
CLINICAL SPECIMENS LIKE LONG

03:25:13.567 --> 03:25:16.303
WASHINGS. CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS

03:25:16.370 --> 03:25:19.373
OR CHEMICAL INHALATION INJURY.

03:25:19.440 --> 03:25:22.009
ACUTE EOSINOPHILIC PNEUMONIA

03:25:22.076 --> 03:25:23.577
BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS

DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR DAMAGE DIFFUSE

03:25:26.113 --> 03:25:28.215
ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE ALL OF

03:25:28.282 --> 03:25:30.251
THESE INVOLVE ACUTE LUNG INJURY

03:25:30.317 --> 03:25:32.019
AND INFLAMMATION SO YOU CAN SEE

03:25:32.086 --> 03:25:33.320
THAT THERE ARE NOW A NUMBER OF

03:25:33.387 --> 03:25:35.156
DIFFERENT CLINICAL SYNDROMES

03:25:35.222 --> 03:25:37.758
THAT ARE EMERGING NOT JUST ONE.

03:25:37.825 --> 03:25:39.226
THE CHALLENGE THERE IS THAT

03:25:39.293 --> 03:25:40.795
MULTIPLE PATTERNS OF LONG

03:25:40.861 --> 03:25:42.697
INJURY SUGGEST MULTIPLE

03:25:42.763 --> 03:25:44.498
MECHANISMS WHICH IN TURN

03:25:44.565 --> 03:25:46.567
SUGGESTS THAT THERE MAY BE

03:25:46.634 --> 03:25:49.103
MULTIPLE DIFFERENT CAUSES

03:25:49.170 --> 03:25:49.704
DIFFERENT CHEMICALS LEADING TO

03:25:49.770 --> 03:25:53.074
THIS NOT JUST ONE. EXTENSIVE

03:25:53.140 --> 03:25:54.408
LABORATORY TESTING IS BEING

03:25:54.475 --> 03:25:56.410
DONE NATIONALLY THERE ARE

03:25:56.477 --> 03:25:58.546
PUBLISHED AND ANECDOTAL REPORTS

03:25:58.612 --> 03:26:00.114
FROM LABS AT THE FEDERAL AND

03:26:00.181 --> 03:26:02.216
STATE LEVEL. ALL OF THEM AGREE

03:26:02.283 --> 03:26:03.617
THAT AT THIS POINT THERE IS NO

03:26:03.684 --> 03:26:07.221
SINGLE DEVICE SUBSTANCE PRODUCT

03:26:07.288 --> 03:26:09.757
OR DEVICE TYPE THAT HAS BEEN

03:26:09.824 --> 03:26:10.357
IDENTIFIED AS THE CAUSE OF THE

03:26:10.424 --> 03:26:13.728
OUTBREAK. VITAMIN E. ACETATE

03:26:13.794 --> 03:26:15.496
HAS BEEN RECOVERED FROM SOME

03:26:15.563 --> 03:26:18.599
PRODUCTS BUT NOT ALL. THE

SURRENDERED BY PATIENTS AND THE

03:26:27.007 --> 03:26:29.543
EXTENSIVE TESTING IS ONGOING.

03:26:29.610 --> 03:26:32.079
THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNS ONE I

03:26:32.146 --> 03:26:33.514
WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THE UNKNOWN

03:26:33.581 --> 03:26:35.916
OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MIX

03:26:35.983 --> 03:26:37.952
CHEMICALS TOGETHER HEAT THAT

03:26:38.018 --> 03:26:40.821
MIXTURE AN AEROSOLIZED IT.

03:26:40.888 --> 03:26:42.990
WHICH MAY CREATE NEW TOXIC

03:26:43.057 --> 03:26:44.992
COMPOUNDS THE EFFECT OF WHICH

03:26:45.059 --> 03:26:47.795
ON THE LONG TISSUE IS UNKNOWN.

03:26:47.862 --> 03:26:49.597
ANOTHER UNKNOWN ARE VARIABLES

COMBINATION OF THESE WITH HEAT

03:26:58.038 --> 03:26:59.473
MAYBE CREATING UNKNOWN

03:26:59.540 --> 03:27:01.175
SUBSTANCES THAT WE DON'T EVEN

03:27:01.242 --> 03:27:04.078
KNOW TO TEST FOR. THE

STAFF AND EXPERTISE TO RESPOND.

03:27:54.428 --> 03:27:55.696
I SPECIALLY WANT TO MENTION THE

03:27:55.763 --> 03:27:57.164
WORK OF OUR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH

03:27:57.231 --> 03:27:58.666
LABORATORIES WHERE IT'S BEEN A

03:27:58.732 --> 03:28:01.168
TEAM EFFORT TO SYNTHESIZE AND

03:28:01.235 --> 03:28:01.635
TEST VARIOUS CHEMICAL

03:28:01.702 --> 03:28:04.672
HYPOTHESES. DESCRIPTION OF THE

03:28:04.738 --> 03:28:06.307
EMERGING CLINICAL SYNDROME

03:28:06.373 --> 03:28:09.009
INCLUDES RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS

03:28:09.076 --> 03:28:09.543
SUCH AS COUGH SHORTNESS OF

03:28:09.610 --> 03:28:12.913
BREATH CHEST PAIN. ANGIE I SENT

03:28:12.980 --> 03:28:14.515
SYMPTOMS INCLUDING ABDOMINAL

03:28:14.582 --> 03:28:17.184
PAIN NAUSEA VOMITING DIARRHEA

03:28:17.251 --> 03:28:18.886
BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES FEVER

03:28:18.953 --> 03:28:22.022
FATIGUE AND WEAKNESS. PATIENTS

03:28:22.089 --> 03:28:24.491
PRESENT WITH LOW OXYGEN LEVELS

03:28:24.558 --> 03:28:26.093
WHICH IS WHY MANY OF THEM NEED

03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:27.094
TO BE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE

03:28:27.161 --> 03:28:29.063
UNIT WITH SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN

03:28:29.129 --> 03:28:30.598
THEY HAVE AN ABNORMAL CHEST X.

03:28:30.664 --> 03:28:32.933
RAY MANY HAVE AN ABNORMAL CT

03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:35.870
SCAN AS WELL SHOWING BILATERAL

03:28:35.936 --> 03:28:36.437
INFILTRATES ON BOTH SIDES OF

03:28:36.503 --> 03:28:39.473
THEIR LINES NOT JUST ONE. THE

03:28:39.540 --> 03:28:41.342
UNKNOWN I'M SORRY THE LONG TERM

03:28:41.408 --> 03:28:43.110
HEALTH EFFECTS ARE UNKNOWN

03:28:43.177 --> 03:28:44.445
BECAUSE THIS IS AN EMERGING

03:28:44.511 --> 03:28:46.280
CLINICAL SYNDROME WE'RE LOOKING

03:28:46.347 --> 03:28:47.348
VERY CAREFULLY AT WHAT'S

03:28:47.414 --> 03:28:49.283
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. BUT WHAT

03:28:49.350 --> 03:28:50.951
HAPPENS WHEN THESE PATIENTS

03:28:51.018 --> 03:28:52.586
LEAVE THE HOSPITAL HOW QUICK IS

03:28:52.653 --> 03:28:55.155
THEIR RECOVERY WILL THEY HAVE

03:28:55.222 --> 03:28:57.157
LIFELONG ADVERSE HEALTHEFFECTS

03:28:57.224 --> 03:28:57.758
ON THEIR LUNGS. WE DON'T KNOW

03:28:57.825 --> 03:29:00.995
THAT YET. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

03:29:01.061 --> 03:29:02.930
IS THIS IS A DIAGNOSIS OF

03:29:02.997 --> 03:29:03.697
EXCLUSION WHICH IS WHY I

03:29:03.764 --> 03:29:05.799
MENTIONED THE SYMPTOMS. IN

03:29:05.866 --> 03:29:07.801
ORDER TO MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS OF

03:29:07.868 --> 03:29:10.070
A BABY CASE YOU HAVE TO FIRST

03:29:10.137 --> 03:29:11.906
RULE OUT INFECTIOUS CAUSES OR

03:29:11.972 --> 03:29:15.009
OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES. THIS

03:29:15.075 --> 03:29:15.542
WILL BE A CHALLENGE DURING

03:29:15.609 --> 03:29:18.112
UPCOMING INFLUENZA SEASON. SO

03:29:18.178 --> 03:29:20.114
HOW DO WE FIND THE CAUSE. THE

03:29:20.180 --> 03:29:21.649
PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO THIS

03:29:21.715 --> 03:29:22.750
AS IT IS TO MANY OTHER

03:29:22.816 --> 03:29:25.052
OUTBREAKS IS A COMBINATION OF

03:29:25.119 --> 03:29:27.254
EXAMINING THE EPIDEMIOLOGY

03:29:27.321 --> 03:29:29.823
DATA. THE CLINICAL SYNDROME THE

03:29:29.890 --> 03:29:30.824
COURSE OF ILLNESS IN THE

03:29:30.891 --> 03:29:32.860
PATIENT. THE PATIENT'S CLINICAL

03:29:32.927 --> 03:29:34.728
SPECIMENS AND OF COURSE A

03:29:34.795 --> 03:29:36.664

03:29:36.730 --> 03:29:38.966
VAPING PRODUCTS THEMSELVES. AND

03:29:39.033 --> 03:29:40.634
IT WILL BE THAT INFORMATION

03:29:40.701 --> 03:29:42.303
DOVE TAILING TOGETHER THAT WILL

03:29:42.369 --> 03:29:44.571
GET US CLOSER TO AN ANSWER. IT

03:29:44.638 --> 03:29:46.006
COULD TAKE YEARS FOR THE

03:29:46.073 --> 03:29:47.174
MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC

03:29:47.241 --> 03:29:49.376
COMMUNITY TO DEFINITIVELY

03:29:49.443 --> 03:29:52.313
DETERMINE WHAT THE CAUSES ARE.

03:29:52.379 --> 03:29:53.814
PUBLIC HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS

03:29:53.881 --> 03:29:55.482
FOR THE PUBLIC ARE IMPORTANT

03:29:55.549 --> 03:29:56.684

LUNGS AND THE RISK OF VAPING

03:30:12.733 --> 03:30:15.502
NOW INCLUDES DEATH. IT CAN BE

03:30:15.569 --> 03:30:17.371
DIFFICULT FOR CONSUMERS TO

03:30:17.438 --> 03:30:19.106
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN REGULATED

03:30:19.173 --> 03:30:21.075
AND UNREGULATED PRODUCTS

OF THESE SYMPTOMS THEY SHOULD

03:30:39.259 --> 03:30:40.761
SEEK CARE IMMEDIATELY AND THEY

03:30:40.828 --> 03:30:42.696
NEED TO SHARE THEIR HONEST AND

03:30:42.763 --> 03:30:44.498
THOROUGH VAPING HISTORY AND

YOU VERY MUCH AND I'VE BEEN

03:31:13.761 --> 03:31:15.062
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE

03:31:15.129 --> 03:31:16.663
CHALLENGES AS WE DO IN OUR COLD

03:31:16.730 --> 03:31:18.332
AND FLU SEASON AND HOW HOW YOU

AND HOW MUCH OF ONE PLUS ONE

03:31:26.473 --> 03:31:27.374
MIGHT EQUAL THREE AND THAT'S

03:31:27.441 --> 03:31:29.543
NOT A GOOD THING IN THIS CASE

03:31:29.610 --> 03:31:32.312
SO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR

03:31:32.379 --> 03:31:35.416
COMMENTS AROUND THAT PEOPLE

03:31:35.482 --> 03:31:40.988
THAT ARE SUFFER PORTING. ANY

03:31:41.055 --> 03:31:44.491
RESIDUAL LEFT FOR TESTING HAS

03:31:44.558 --> 03:31:46.560
THAT IS THAT AND HOW MANY

03:31:46.627 --> 03:31:47.461
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY DOING THAT

03:31:47.528 --> 03:31:50.664
OR IS PRESENT CONSUMED IN ALL

03:31:50.731 --> 03:31:51.932
GONE BEFORE THEY GET TO YOU.

03:31:51.999 --> 03:31:54.535
SURE SOME PATIENTS ARE

03:31:54.601 --> 03:31:56.236
VOLUNTARILY TURNING OVER THE

03:31:56.303 --> 03:31:58.572
PRODUCT AND THEIR VAPING DEVICE

03:31:58.639 --> 03:32:01.375
AND THOSE ARE SENT TO THE

03:32:01.442 --> 03:32:02.009
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

03:32:02.076 --> 03:32:05.479
HEALTH TO CONDUCT TESTING. AND

03:32:05.546 --> 03:32:06.947
SO ALL THE RESULT THE RESULTS

03:32:07.014 --> 03:32:08.148
ARE STE IT TAKES A WHILE TO DO

03:32:08.215 --> 03:32:09.950
THAT OBVIOUSLY SO. IT'S BEEN A

03:32:10.017 --> 03:32:12.252
VERY COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND WE'RE

03:32:12.319 --> 03:32:13.487
LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE

03:32:13.554 --> 03:32:14.922
RESULTS BUT IT REALLY IS IN THE

03:32:14.988 --> 03:32:16.457
BEGINNING STAGES OF A

03:32:16.523 --> 03:32:17.991
COMPREHENSIVE LABORATORY

03:32:18.058 --> 03:32:20.828
ANALYSIS. CONSIDERING HOW MANY

03:32:20.894 --> 03:32:22.296
CHEMICALS HAVE TO BE TESTED

03:32:22.362 --> 03:32:31.371
FOR. THANK YOU. FIRST OFF THE

03:32:31.438 --> 03:32:33.740
FREE TEST MY WERE WE ARE. FIRST

03:32:33.807 --> 03:32:34.808
CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT AND

03:32:34.875 --> 03:32:37.511
LOOKED INTO AT THAT TIME THE

03:32:37.578 --> 03:32:40.114
REPORTED CASES MY RECOLLECTION.

03:32:40.180 --> 03:32:42.583
WAS SIXTY TWO AT A SIXTY THREE

03:32:42.649 --> 03:32:45.352
CASES WERE REPORTED THC WITH

03:32:45.419 --> 03:32:50.090
ONE. CASE I KNOW AND I HEARD

03:32:50.157 --> 03:32:53.227
YOU SAY EARLIER 81% THC AS HAVE

03:32:53.293 --> 03:32:55.729
THERE BEEN MORE CASES HAS THAT

03:32:55.796 --> 03:32:56.330
HAS THAT INFORMATION CHANGED.

03:32:56.396 --> 03:32:59.299
SINCE I LAST SPOKE WITH. SURE I

03:32:59.366 --> 03:33:00.834
CAN'T REMEMBER THAT EXACT WEEK

03:33:00.901 --> 03:33:02.402
BECAUSE THE DATA IS CHANGING SO

03:33:02.469 --> 03:33:05.672
RAPIDLY BUT YES YOU ARE CORRECT

03:33:05.739 --> 03:33:08.408
RIGHT NOW 81% OF THE CASES SELF

03:33:08.475 --> 03:33:11.011
REPORT USING THC. THE NEW ONES

03:33:11.078 --> 03:33:12.746
IS THAT MANY OF THE CASES ARE

03:33:12.813 --> 03:33:15.182
COMBINING THE THC WITH C. B. D.

03:33:15.249 --> 03:33:17.084
AN WITH NICOTINE. AND SO IF

03:33:17.151 --> 03:33:17.851
YOU'RE TO ADD UP THE

03:33:17.918 --> 03:33:20.020
PERCENTAGES THAT WE THE DATA

03:33:20.087 --> 03:33:21.388
THAT WE PUBLISHED ON OUR

03:33:21.455 --> 03:33:22.122
WEBSITE TODAY YOU'LL SEE IT

03:33:22.189 --> 03:33:23.390
DOESN'T ADD TO A HUNDRED

03:33:23.457 --> 03:33:25.893
PERCENT. BECAUSE MANY OF THEM

03:33:25.959 --> 03:33:26.460
ARE COMBINING THE SUBSTANCES

03:33:26.527 --> 03:33:30.898
TOGETHER. IN THE MEDIA REPORTS

03:33:30.964 --> 03:33:34.001
A LONG ILLNESSES HAVE. AT LEAST

03:33:34.067 --> 03:33:35.602
IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED LINKED TO

03:33:35.669 --> 03:33:38.305
BLACK MARKET. PRODUCTS AND

03:33:38.372 --> 03:33:38.872
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF QUESTION

03:33:38.939 --> 03:33:41.675
ABOUT THAT TODAY. HAVE THERE

03:33:41.742 --> 03:33:42.910
BEEN ANY CASES OF LONG ILLNESS

03:33:42.976 --> 03:33:44.611
OR DEATH FOR THAT MATTER. WHO

03:33:44.678 --> 03:33:46.680
HAVE USED LEGAL CANNABIS

03:33:46.747 --> 03:33:50.751
PRODUCTS EXCLUSIVELY. I CAN

03:33:50.817 --> 03:33:52.219
ONLY SPEAK TO THE DATA THAT WE

03:33:52.286 --> 03:33:56.490
HAVE FOR CALIFORNIA. OF THE

03:33:56.557 --> 03:33:57.090
SEVENTY EIGHT CASES WHO WERE

03:33:57.157 --> 03:33:59.560
INTERVIEWED IN CALIFORNIA THERE

03:33:59.626 --> 03:34:02.930
WAS ONLY ONE CASE SELF REPORTED

03:34:02.996 --> 03:34:04.631
EXCLUSIVELY PURCHASING FROM

03:34:04.698 --> 03:34:07.301
LICENSED RETAILERS AND IT'S

03:34:07.367 --> 03:34:08.635
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN WE

03:34:08.702 --> 03:34:10.370
DO THESE EPIDEMIOLOGY

03:34:10.437 --> 03:34:12.839
INTERVIEWS FOR ANY OUTBREAK.

03:34:12.906 --> 03:34:15.842
WERE ASKING PATIENTS TO USE

03:34:15.909 --> 03:34:17.277
THEIR BEST RECOLLECTION AND

03:34:17.344 --> 03:34:20.113
SELF REPORT TO THE INTERVIEWER

03:34:20.180 --> 03:34:22.649
AND SO WE LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT

03:34:22.716 --> 03:34:23.217
OF THAT AND THAT STILL BEING

03:34:23.283 --> 03:34:25.652
INVESTIGATED. BUT THERE WAS

03:34:25.719 --> 03:34:27.221
ONLY ONE CASE THAT SOFT

03:34:27.287 --> 03:34:29.856
REPORTED EXCLUSIVELY LEGAL

03:34:29.923 --> 03:34:32.226
RETAILERS EVERYONE ELSE WE CAN

03:34:32.292 --> 03:34:32.960
ASSUME BASED ON THEIR SELF

03:34:33.026 --> 03:34:36.063
REPORT NON LEGAL PRODUCTS

03:34:36.129 --> 03:34:38.165
REALLY SOME NOT LEGAL PRODUCTS.

03:34:38.232 --> 03:34:40.200
THAT'S CORRECT THE REST TO SELF

03:34:40.267 --> 03:34:42.135
REPORTED EVEN THE ONES WHO MAY

03:34:42.202 --> 03:34:43.370
HAVE MENTIONED A BRICK AND

03:34:43.437 --> 03:34:45.572
MORTAR LOCATION THOSE WERE NOT

03:34:45.639 --> 03:34:47.674
ABLE TO BE FOUND OR NOT ABLE TO

03:34:47.741 --> 03:34:49.743
BE VERIFIED IS LICENSED AND HOW

03:34:49.810 --> 03:34:51.445
MANY OF THEM REPORT EXCLUSIVELY

03:34:51.511 --> 03:34:54.681
USING NICOTINE BABY PRODUCTS

03:34:54.748 --> 03:34:57.184
AND KNOW OUR THC OR MARIJUANA

03:34:57.251 --> 03:34:59.853
PRODUCTS ONLY TEN PERCENT. OF

03:34:59.920 --> 03:35:00.387
THE SEVENTY EIGHT WHO WERE

03:35:00.454 --> 03:35:05.259
INTERVIEWED. I ASKED MY STAFF

03:35:05.325 --> 03:35:07.527
TO DO A LITTLE RESEARCH. IT

03:35:07.594 --> 03:35:09.096
STRUCK ME AS ODD THE THING IS

03:35:09.162 --> 03:35:11.698
NOT A ACTIVITY THE ONLY OCCURS

03:35:11.765 --> 03:35:13.400
HERE IN UNITED STATES BUT YET

03:35:13.467 --> 03:35:15.535
I'VE HEARD NOTHING OR READ

03:35:15.602 --> 03:35:18.805
NOTHING. ABOUT DEATH ILLNESS AT

03:35:18.872 --> 03:35:19.573
CENTER OF DO TODAY BEING

03:35:19.640 --> 03:35:22.142
OUTSIDE UNITED STATES. CAN YOU

03:35:22.209 --> 03:35:23.377
SPEAK TO THAT'LL HAVE YOU SEEN

03:35:23.443 --> 03:35:26.380
ANY EVIDENCE OR REPORTS

03:35:26.446 --> 03:35:28.148
WORLDWIDE. THERE HAVE BEEN A

03:35:28.215 --> 03:35:29.983
HANDFUL OF CASES REPORTED IN

03:35:30.050 --> 03:35:32.419
CANADA I'M NOT AWARE OF THESE

03:35:32.486 --> 03:35:35.489
CLUSTERS OR OUTBREAK EMERGING

03:35:35.555 --> 03:35:36.089
IN OTHER COUNTRIES. DOES THAT

03:35:36.156 --> 03:35:39.326
STRIKE YOU AS ODD. IT STRIKES

03:35:39.393 --> 03:35:41.561
ME AS INTERESTING. AND AS WE

03:35:41.628 --> 03:35:43.563
LOOK AT ALL THE POSSIBLE CAUSES

03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:44.865
IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING

03:35:44.931 --> 03:35:47.000
OUR SB DATA OUR PATIENTS THAT

03:35:47.067 --> 03:35:49.870
THE CLINICAL LABS. THAT

03:35:49.936 --> 03:35:51.238
SOMETHING THAT WERE BEING OUT

03:35:51.305 --> 03:35:53.240
WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT CHANGED

03:35:53.307 --> 03:35:59.212
AND WHY NOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

03:35:59.279 --> 03:36:02.449
TIME AND APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS.

03:36:02.516 --> 03:36:04.251
JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON IT I

03:36:04.318 --> 03:36:05.786
APPRECIATE YOUR LINE OF

03:36:05.852 --> 03:36:06.386
QUESTIONING THERE SO I THINK

03:36:06.453 --> 03:36:08.322
IT'S I THINK IS REALLY VALUABLE

03:36:08.388 --> 03:36:10.023
SAID SOMEONE REPORTED WE HAD

03:36:10.090 --> 03:36:11.291
ONE PERSON REPORT THAT THEY HAD

03:36:11.358 --> 03:36:13.794
PURCHASED FROM A LICENSED.

03:36:13.860 --> 03:36:15.862
REGULATED CANNABIS FACILITY WAS

03:36:15.929 --> 03:36:18.265
AT VERIFIED THAT THAT INDEED

03:36:18.332 --> 03:36:20.067
WAS A LICENSED FACILITY OR WAS

03:36:20.133 --> 03:36:22.836
THAT THE PATIENTS RECOLLECTION

03:36:22.903 --> 03:36:23.437
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A

03:36:23.503 --> 03:36:25.706
LICENSED FACILITY. THAT

03:36:25.772 --> 03:36:27.541
INVESTIGATION IS STILL ONGOING

03:36:27.607 --> 03:36:29.810
ALT ALL TELL YOU THAT WE SHARE

03:36:29.876 --> 03:36:31.311
WE AS PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN WE GET

03:36:31.378 --> 03:36:32.713
THOSE REPORTS FROM PATIENTS

03:36:32.779 --> 03:36:34.348
THAT WERE INTERVIEWED. WE SHARE

03:36:34.414 --> 03:36:36.783
THEM WITH BCC SO THAT THEY CAN

03:36:36.850 --> 03:36:38.618
BE INVESTIGATED. IN THAT ONE

03:36:38.685 --> 03:36:40.787
CASE THE FACILITY THE BRICK AND

03:36:40.854 --> 03:36:42.689
MORTAR LOCATION THAT WAS

03:36:42.756 --> 03:36:44.057
MENTIONED WAS CONFIRMED TO BE

03:36:44.124 --> 03:36:47.227
LICENSED. BUT ASPECTS OF THAT

03:36:47.294 --> 03:36:47.828
ARE STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.

03:36:47.894 --> 03:36:51.064
THANK YOU. MR Là THANK YOU

03:36:51.131 --> 03:36:52.632
VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THE

03:36:52.699 --> 03:36:54.701
COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE AND IF I

03:36:54.768 --> 03:36:56.036
REMEMBER CORRECTLY YOU HAD

03:36:56.103 --> 03:36:58.004
INDICATED THAT OF THE DATA

03:36:58.071 --> 03:37:00.073
STILL INCONCLUSIVE BUT THAT YOU

03:37:00.140 --> 03:37:01.341
ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING TO THE

03:37:01.408 --> 03:37:03.744
DISTINCTION ON. A WHAT IS BEEN

03:37:03.810 --> 03:37:05.178
RECENTLY INTRODUCED AND THAT

03:37:05.245 --> 03:37:06.980
WHEN THERE'S A CONCLUSION AND

03:37:07.047 --> 03:37:08.115
TO HOPEFULLY FINDING THE

03:37:08.181 --> 03:37:10.150
CULPRIT THAT THAT INFORMATION

03:37:10.217 --> 03:37:12.152
WILL BE READILY AVAILABLE BUT

03:37:12.219 --> 03:37:13.420
FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHEN

03:37:13.487 --> 03:37:15.322
THAT TIME COMES TO WHICH THEN.

03:37:15.389 --> 03:37:17.224
A GIVEN YOUR RESEARCH THAT YOU

03:37:17.290 --> 03:37:18.959
DO FIND CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF

03:37:19.025 --> 03:37:20.727
WHERE THE CULPRIT IS WHAT BEEN

03:37:20.794 --> 03:37:22.629
TRANSPIRES SO THAT WE CAN

03:37:22.696 --> 03:37:24.064
ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS WILL BE

03:37:24.131 --> 03:37:25.399
PROTECTED DOES THAT COME FROM

03:37:25.465 --> 03:37:26.566
EXECUTIVE ORDER DOES THAT COME

03:37:26.633 --> 03:37:30.003
FROM. OF ADMINISTRATION AND

03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.604
WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE HOW

03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:33.140
DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING. I

03:37:33.206 --> 03:37:33.774
THINK THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT

03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:36.910
THE CULPRIT WAS. IT'S NOT CLEAR

03:37:36.977 --> 03:37:40.347
THAT IT'S JUST THE SUBSTANCE OR

03:37:40.414 --> 03:37:41.381
JUST THE DEVICE IT COULD EVEN

03:37:41.448 --> 03:37:43.617
BE A COMBINATION OF THEM SO IT

03:37:43.683 --> 03:37:45.752
SEEMS THAT THE ABILITY TO STOP

03:37:45.819 --> 03:37:47.721
THE OUTBREAK ENDS AND REMOVE

03:37:47.788 --> 03:37:49.823
THE CULPRIT SUBSTANCE OR DEVICE

03:37:49.890 --> 03:37:51.691
WILL DEPEND ON WHAT IT IS RIGHT

03:37:51.758 --> 03:37:53.693
NOW AND NUMBER OF HYPOTHESES

03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:54.127
ARE BEING LOOKED AT.

03:37:54.194 --> 03:37:58.131
EVERYTHING'S ON THE TABLE. AND

03:37:58.198 --> 03:38:00.367
COMBINATIONS AND THAT IS TAKES

03:38:00.434 --> 03:38:02.035
TO CONCLUSION TO WHICH IS

03:38:02.102 --> 03:38:04.037
CAUSING HARM AND DEATH WHAT

03:38:04.104 --> 03:38:07.374
THEN TRANSPIRES. THEN DID DO WE

03:38:07.441 --> 03:38:08.408
SEE THE ADMINISTRATION AN

03:38:08.475 --> 03:38:09.776
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO IS THAT THE

03:38:09.843 --> 03:38:11.178
LEGISLATURE YOU COME TO THE

03:38:11.244 --> 03:38:12.779
LEGISLATION SAYING OKAY HERE'S

03:38:12.846 --> 03:38:13.747
WHAT IT ISPLEASE PASSED

03:38:13.814 --> 03:38:16.216
LEGISLATION HOW DO YOU SEE DID

03:38:16.283 --> 03:38:16.817
YOU HAVE A SENSE ON HOW THAT

03:38:16.883 --> 03:38:19.252
WOULD THAN. BEFORE MY SENSE IS

03:38:19.319 --> 03:38:21.021
THAT IF WE KNEW WHAT WAS

03:38:21.087 --> 03:38:24.591
CAUSING THIS THAT SWIFT ACTION

03:38:24.658 --> 03:38:25.192
WOULD BE TAKEN AND ALL OPTIONS

03:38:25.258 --> 03:38:27.461
WOULD BE CONSIDERED. THANK YOU.

03:38:27.527 --> 03:38:31.698
THREE OF US. AND SO THAT'S A

03:38:31.765 --> 03:38:33.266
YOU KNOW A GREAT QUESTION AND

03:38:33.333 --> 03:38:36.002
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW SO BASED ON

03:38:36.069 --> 03:38:38.438
ON ON ON WHAT YOU MENTIONED YOU

03:38:38.505 --> 03:38:40.006
KNOW I FIND A STARTLING THAT

03:38:40.073 --> 03:38:40.907
THIS COULD TAKE YEARS TO FIND

03:38:40.974 --> 03:38:43.009
OUT WHAT THE CULPRIT IS A BASED

03:38:43.076 --> 03:38:44.778
ON WHERE WE ARE NOW IT SEEMS

03:38:44.845 --> 03:38:45.545
LIKE THIS IS OBVIOUS IN

03:38:45.612 --> 03:38:47.848
EVOLVING ISSUE AS YOU MENTIONED

03:38:47.914 --> 03:38:50.050
THE DATA SEEMS TO BE CHANGING

03:38:50.116 --> 03:38:51.184
AND EVERY STATE IS HANDLING

03:38:51.251 --> 03:38:53.587
THIS CRISIS AS IT IS FROM DAY

03:38:53.653 --> 03:38:56.323
TO DAY IN THEIR OWN WAY. WE AS

03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:58.225
A STATE BASED ON THE EXECUTIVE

03:38:58.291 --> 03:39:00.227
ORDER THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED

03:39:00.293 --> 03:39:03.096
IS THAT ENOUGH IS THAT RESPONSE

03:39:03.163 --> 03:39:06.066
ENOUGH FOR OUR STATE WITH THIS

03:39:06.132 --> 03:39:11.371
CRISIS. MOVING FORWARD. MANY

03:39:11.438 --> 03:39:12.739
OPTIONS ARE BEING CONSIDERED TO

03:39:12.806 --> 03:39:14.441
RESPOND TO THIS CRISIS THE

03:39:14.508 --> 03:39:17.210
RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPONSE TO

03:39:17.277 --> 03:39:18.078
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ARE STILL

03:39:18.144 --> 03:39:20.814
BEING FINALIZED. BUT MANY

03:39:20.881 --> 03:39:22.682
OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE

03:39:22.749 --> 03:39:24.351
INCLUDING SWIFT ACTIONS

03:39:24.417 --> 03:39:28.054
THOROUGH OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THE

03:39:28.121 --> 03:39:28.655
OUTBREAK AND THE YOUTH VAPING

03:39:28.722 --> 03:39:31.858
EPIDEMIC. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE

03:39:31.925 --> 03:39:34.361
DISTINCT ISSUES THE OUTBREAK OF

03:39:34.427 --> 03:39:35.629
VAPING LONG INJURY AND THE

03:39:35.695 --> 03:39:37.864
YOUTH VAPING EPIDEMIC THEY ARE

03:39:37.931 --> 03:39:39.466
RELATED THERE IS SOME

03:39:39.533 --> 03:39:40.433
CROSSOVERS I THINK DOCTOR WOULD

03:39:40.500 --> 03:39:41.334
HAVE POINTED OUT AT THE

03:39:41.401 --> 03:39:42.802
BEGINNING. AND SO THE

03:39:42.869 --> 03:39:43.904
RECOMMENDATIONS BEING

03:39:43.970 --> 03:39:46.973
CONSIDERED TAKE A BROAD

03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:47.541
APPROACH AND EVERYTHING'S ON

03:39:47.607 --> 03:39:53.013
THE TABLE. RESTORED FINAL

03:39:53.079 --> 03:39:54.581
FINALLY THANK YOU THANK YOU IS

03:39:54.648 --> 03:39:55.882
THE MORE SEVERE THE MORE HERE

03:39:55.949 --> 03:39:56.449
THAN WHERE YOU QUESTIONS YOU

03:39:56.516 --> 03:39:58.952
COME UP WITH BUT CONSIDERING

03:39:59.019 --> 03:40:00.620
THAT ACTUALLY VAPING HAS BEEN

03:40:00.687 --> 03:40:03.189
AROUND FOR AWHILE AND NOT JUST

03:40:03.256 --> 03:40:06.026
NICOTINE BUT ALSO CANNABIS DOES

03:40:06.092 --> 03:40:07.594
IT NOT SURPRISE YOU THAT

03:40:07.661 --> 03:40:09.763
SUDDENLY THIS IS HAPPENING THIS

03:40:09.829 --> 03:40:11.731
THIS THIS JUST FEELS A LOT LIKE

03:40:11.798 --> 03:40:13.533
THIS IS ISOLATE TO SOMETHING

03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:15.702
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER

03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:16.903
THINGS YOU YOU KNOW WE GO BACK

03:40:16.970 --> 03:40:18.838
TO SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND THE

03:40:18.905 --> 03:40:20.473
CANNABIS INDUSTRY THAT'S THEIR

03:40:20.540 --> 03:40:21.508
MEETINGS BEEN GOING ON FOR

03:40:21.575 --> 03:40:23.209
AWHILE CERTAINLY WITH

03:40:23.276 --> 03:40:24.144
NICOTINE'S BEEN GOING ON FOR

03:40:24.210 --> 03:40:24.678
AWHILE BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN

03:40:24.744 --> 03:40:27.047
WHICH THERE'S SOMETHING

03:40:27.113 --> 03:40:29.449
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT AND THIS

03:40:29.516 --> 03:40:33.820
IS THAT THAT OBVIOUSLY IS

03:40:33.887 --> 03:40:34.454
UNUSUAL ON DOES THAT. DOES THAT

03:40:34.521 --> 03:40:36.756
SURPRISE YOU IN SOME WAY. YES

03:40:36.823 --> 03:40:38.959
AND AS WE DISCUSSED THIS WITH

03:40:39.025 --> 03:40:41.061
OTHER STATES WHO WERE FACING A

03:40:41.127 --> 03:40:43.730
SIMILAR OUTBREAK SITUATION

03:40:43.797 --> 03:40:44.264
SINCE AUGUST THAT QUESTION

03:40:44.331 --> 03:40:48.835
EMERGED. THE INCREASING CASES

03:40:48.902 --> 03:40:50.203
THAT WE'RE SEEING IS IT AN

03:40:50.270 --> 03:40:52.205
ARTIFACT OF US LOOKING FOR THEM

03:40:52.272 --> 03:40:54.874
HAD THEY BEEN THERE ALL ALONG I

03:40:54.941 --> 03:40:56.242
BELIEVE IN CALIFORNIA THE

03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:58.178
ANSWER IS NOW THAT THIS IS

03:40:58.244 --> 03:40:59.746
SOMETHING NEW THAT WERE SAYING

03:40:59.813 --> 03:41:02.048
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. WE

03:41:02.115 --> 03:41:03.617
DON'T KNOW THE CAUSE YET SO WE

03:41:03.683 --> 03:41:05.185
DON'T KNOW WHY BUT WE'RE

03:41:05.251 --> 03:41:06.720
LOOKING AT MULTIPLE THEORIES

03:41:06.786 --> 03:41:09.656
AND ASKING WHAT CHANGED TO

03:41:09.723 --> 03:41:11.591
BECAUSE THIS SPIKING CASES

03:41:11.658 --> 03:41:12.959
THERE ARE REPORTS IN THE

03:41:13.026 --> 03:41:14.894
LITERATURE REPORTING SIMILAR

03:41:14.961 --> 03:41:17.163
ADD VAPING LONG INJURY CASES

03:41:17.230 --> 03:41:18.698
FROM BEFORE AUGUST OF TWO

03:41:18.765 --> 03:41:21.267
THOUSAND NINETEEN. BUT NOT EVEN

03:41:21.334 --> 03:41:21.868
CLOSE TO THE NUMBER THAT WE'RE

03:41:21.935 --> 03:41:26.873
SEEING NOW. THAT KIND OF BRINGS

03:41:26.940 --> 03:41:30.844
ME BACK TO WINE. THE VITAMIN A

03:41:30.910 --> 03:41:33.980
ACETATE YOU MENTION THAT. WAS

03:41:34.047 --> 03:41:36.383
AN INGREDIENT NOT FOUND IN ALL

03:41:36.449 --> 03:41:40.854
CASES BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW.

03:41:40.920 --> 03:41:42.155
ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF INHALING

03:41:42.222 --> 03:41:45.425
VITAMIN ASKED. I'M SORRY THE

03:41:45.492 --> 03:41:45.992
EFFECTS OF WHAT OF INHALING

03:41:46.059 --> 03:41:48.361
VITAMIN THE ASKED. DO WE KNOW

03:41:48.428 --> 03:41:50.263
ANYTHING NOT A LOT SO ONE OF

03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:52.298
THE CHALLENGES OF INVESTIGATING

03:41:52.365 --> 03:41:53.600
POSSIBLE CULPRITS LIKE VITAMIN

03:41:53.667 --> 03:41:56.770
A ACETATE. I'M IS THAT IT'S NOT

03:41:56.836 --> 03:41:59.839
JUST THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF SO IT

03:41:59.906 --> 03:42:01.741
MIGHT BE SAFE WHEN INGESTED YOU

03:42:01.808 --> 03:42:03.476
CAN EAT IT MAYBE IT'S A VITAMIN

03:42:03.543 --> 03:42:05.045
YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

03:42:05.111 --> 03:42:06.146
THINK MAY HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS

03:42:06.212 --> 03:42:08.181
WHEN EATEN. BUT WHEN YOU HEAT

03:42:08.248 --> 03:42:09.749
IT UP AND YOU VAPORIZE IT AND

03:42:09.816 --> 03:42:12.285
YOU INHALE IT INTO THE LONG.

03:42:12.352 --> 03:42:14.554
THE EFFECTS IT HAS ON THE LONG

03:42:14.621 --> 03:42:16.523
TISSUE ON THE LITTLE AIR SACS

03:42:16.589 --> 03:42:19.025
IS UNKNOWN AND SO LOOKING AT

03:42:19.092 --> 03:42:21.194
EACH CULPRIT EVEN AS VITAMIN A

03:42:21.261 --> 03:42:23.430
ACETATE IS CONSIDERED ISN'T

03:42:23.496 --> 03:42:25.198
JUST TESTING THE ACTUAL LIQUID

03:42:25.265 --> 03:42:27.267
ITSELF. IT INVOLVES TESTING

03:42:27.333 --> 03:42:28.134
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT'S

03:42:28.201 --> 03:42:29.669
VAPORIZED OUR NEW COMPOUNDS

03:42:29.736 --> 03:42:31.504
CREATED AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS

03:42:31.571 --> 03:42:33.173
WHEN IT'S INHALED INTO THE LONG

03:42:33.239 --> 03:42:34.441
WHAT DOES THE TISSUE DAMAGE

03:42:34.507 --> 03:42:35.909
LOOK LIKE WHAT DO THE CELLS

03:42:35.975 --> 03:42:37.677
LOOK LIKE. THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:42:37.744 --> 03:42:38.845
REASONS WHY GETTING TO THE

03:42:38.912 --> 03:42:41.147
BOTTOM OF THIS COULD TAKE TIME

03:42:41.214 --> 03:42:42.315
BECAUSE IT COULD INVOLVE

03:42:42.382 --> 03:42:45.385
STUDIES OVER A PERIOD OF TIME

03:42:45.452 --> 03:42:47.120
USING ANIMAL MODELS LOOKING AT

03:42:47.187 --> 03:42:50.023
OF A- WIDE RANGE OF TOXINS THAT

03:42:50.090 --> 03:42:52.292
ARE HEATED TO THE POINT OF

03:42:52.358 --> 03:42:54.761
BEING VAPORIZE AND THEN

03:42:54.828 --> 03:42:57.397
INHALED. INTO THE LUNGS. SO I

03:42:57.464 --> 03:42:58.198
THINK YOU'RE REGIONAL QUESTION

03:42:58.264 --> 03:42:58.732
WAS WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF

03:42:58.798 --> 03:43:01.367
VITAMIN E. ACETATE. IT WAS AT

03:43:01.434 --> 03:43:02.602
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WHAT WAS

03:43:02.669 --> 03:43:03.737
CAUSING THE LIGHT POINT

03:43:03.803 --> 03:43:07.006
AMMONIA. THAT IS BEING EXAMINED

03:43:07.073 --> 03:43:14.881
AND STUDIED AND- YET UNKNOWN.

03:43:14.948 --> 03:43:16.015
IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S

03:43:16.082 --> 03:43:18.918
NOT. IT IS AT THIS TIME A LEGAL

03:43:18.985 --> 03:43:22.422
INGREDIENT. FOR ILLEGAL

03:43:22.489 --> 03:43:24.924
CANNABIS PRODUCTS IS THE IS THE

03:43:24.991 --> 03:43:26.326
IS THAT CORRECT OR IS IT IN

03:43:26.392 --> 03:43:27.827
FACT IT BANNED INGREDIENTS WE

03:43:27.894 --> 03:43:29.262
TAKE ANY ACTION ON THAT TO YOUR

03:43:29.329 --> 03:43:31.631
KNOWLEDGE ON VITAMIN E. ACETATE

03:43:31.698 --> 03:43:35.068
IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE LIST

03:43:35.135 --> 03:43:35.635
OF THINGS THAT MANUFACTURERS

03:43:35.702 --> 03:43:42.041
MUST TEST FOR. OKAY. ANY OTHER

03:43:42.108 --> 03:43:43.643
QUESTIONS COMMENTS BEFORE WE

03:43:43.710 --> 03:43:46.846
MAKE HER JUST. I'VE BEEN GOING

03:43:46.913 --> 03:43:48.414
BACK AND FORTH WELL AND IT IS

03:43:48.481 --> 03:43:50.049
THE BACK AND FORTH AND IT IS IT

03:43:50.116 --> 03:43:51.718
IS A IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

03:43:51.785 --> 03:43:52.285
WITH WHEN I'M I'M SICKENED

03:43:52.352 --> 03:43:53.553
SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE

03:43:53.620 --> 03:43:54.687
CANNABIS INDUSTRY THINGS ONE OF

03:43:54.754 --> 03:43:55.488
THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS

03:43:55.555 --> 03:43:56.923
INDUSTRY THERE ARE THINGS IN

03:43:56.990 --> 03:43:58.458
THE HISTORY THAT HAVE BEEN USED

03:43:58.525 --> 03:44:00.460
IN THE PAST THAT WERE SAFE ON

03:44:00.527 --> 03:44:01.761
OTHER THINGS I THINK THERE'S A

03:44:01.828 --> 03:44:03.062
THERE'S A THERE'S A PESTICIDE

03:44:03.129 --> 03:44:04.697
CALLED EAGLE TWENTY YEARS OR SO

03:44:04.764 --> 03:44:05.765
I'M I MAY BE SAYING IT WRONG.

03:44:05.832 --> 03:44:08.234
BUT WAS USEFUL USED ON LEAFY

03:44:08.301 --> 03:44:09.169
VEGETABLES AND OTHER KINDS OF

03:44:09.235 --> 03:44:12.438
THINGS AND IT WAS SAFE BUT WHEN

03:44:12.505 --> 03:44:13.873
YOU ACTUALLY BURNED IT INTO

03:44:13.940 --> 03:44:16.976
ITALY IT LIBERATED CYANIDE SO

03:44:17.043 --> 03:44:18.278
THAT'S OVIOUSLY NOT SAFE AND

03:44:18.344 --> 03:44:21.080
IT WAS NOT KNOWN BY A OTHER

03:44:21.147 --> 03:44:24.184
PEOPLE SO. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

03:44:24.250 --> 03:44:25.618
TESTING FOR IT NOW WELL IF TO

03:44:25.685 --> 03:44:30.356
THE BUREAU. THERE MAY BE OTHER

03:44:30.423 --> 03:44:33.526
THINGS IT EMERGED HAVE. VITAMIN

03:44:33.593 --> 03:44:34.527
THE ACETATE ON ITS OWN MAY BE

03:44:34.594 --> 03:44:35.094
PERFECTLY SAFE BUT IN THIS

03:44:35.161 --> 03:44:36.196
SETTING MAY MAY NOT. AND SO IT

03:44:36.262 --> 03:44:38.998
IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING. AS

03:44:39.065 --> 03:44:40.867
PEOPLE OR- SOME PROBABLY

03:44:40.934 --> 03:44:43.303
EXPERIMENTING QUITE FRANKLY.

03:44:43.369 --> 03:44:44.771
AND ADDING THINGS TO THE

03:44:44.838 --> 03:44:46.139
PRODUCTS TO ENHANCE THEM IN

03:44:46.206 --> 03:44:48.374
SOME WAY BUT- BUT THIS IS THIS

03:44:48.441 --> 03:44:51.010
IS NOT AN UNUSUAL. OCCURRENCE

03:44:51.077 --> 03:44:52.812
OF THIS THIS IS AN ISOLATED

03:44:52.879 --> 03:44:53.813
INCIDENT WITH THIS WITH THE

03:44:53.880 --> 03:44:56.349
INDUSTRY AND- PART OF THAT IS

03:44:56.416 --> 03:44:59.285
THE CHALLENGE OF DOING RESEARCH

03:44:59.352 --> 03:44:59.819
AND BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT

03:44:59.886 --> 03:45:00.420
TRULY A SAFE AND WHICH REALLY

03:45:00.486 --> 03:45:09.662
ISN'T. I THINK AFTER. THANK YOU

03:45:09.729 --> 03:45:10.997
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK AT

03:45:11.064 --> 03:45:13.132
THIS TIME WE WILL TAKE ANY

03:45:13.199 --> 03:45:28.648
PUBLIC COMMENT. ONE ANY OF US.

03:45:28.715 --> 03:45:31.351
OKAY SEE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT

03:45:31.417 --> 03:45:32.485
INTERESTED PUBLIC COMMENT WE'RE
