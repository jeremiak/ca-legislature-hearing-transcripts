00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:19.297
SHOULD TAKE TO RESPOND TO THESE

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:20.264
TYPES OF INCIDENTS WE BELIEVE

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:21.933
THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:23.368
STUDENTS CIVIL RIGHTS ARE

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:24.836

EMILY WAGNER I'LL SOON BE A

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:43.020
COLLEGE SENIOR IN CALIFORNIA I'M

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:44.155
HISTORY EDUCATION MAJOR

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:46.824
GEOGRAPHY MINOR AND MEMBER OF

00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:47.425
THE WOMEN'S ROWING TEAM AT MY

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:48.459
SCHOOL.

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:50.428
DURING MY SOPHOMORE YEAR I WAS

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:51.429
VERY BY A MEMBER OF THE

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:54.098
UNIVERSITY'S FOOTBALL TEAM.

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:55.299
I HAD THOUGHT I HAD A HARD TIME

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:56.868
FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO AND I

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:59.570
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN.

00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:01.272
MY SCHOOL IS A SMALL CAMPUS AND

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:03.274
SINCE WE WERE BOTH ATHLETES.

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:04.075
I OFTEN OTHER CROSSED PATHS WITH

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:06.344
HIM AND HIS ROOMMATE WHO WAS

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:07.745
THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED.

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:09.147
GOING TO CALPERS BECAME

00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:11.048
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT -- MY

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:13.050
COACH NOTICED I WAS OUT OF SORTS

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:14.152
AND CALLED ME IN FOR A MEETING.

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.120
I JUST CLOSER WOULD HAPPEN AND

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:18.389
SHE CALLED THE DEAN OF STUDENTS.

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:20.358
WHO IS ALSO IN CHARGE OF TITLE?

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:23.161
NINE I WAS TERRIFIED TO REPORT

00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:23.761
THE RATE BECAUSE THE SCHOOL SO

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:24.762
SMALL.

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:25.663
AND THE UNIVERSITY HAS A HISTORY

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.265
WITH SWEEPING SEXUAL ASSAULTS

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:28.132
UNDER THE RUG.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:28.699
HOWEVER NOTHING COULD HAVE

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:30.368
PREPARED ME FOR HOW BAD IT

00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:32.136
ACTUALLY WAS.

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.104
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE TEAM

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:34.939
WAS VERY VAGUE AND UNCLEAR ABOUT

00:34:35.006 --> 00:34:37.375
THE ENTIRE PROCESS THE POSSIBLE

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.410
OUTCOMES IN TIME LINES WERE

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:41.412
NEVER FULLY EXPLAINED TO ME.

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:42.246
THE TEAM SEEMED TO LACK TRAINING

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:43.181
OFTEN MAKING INAPPROPRIATE

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:45.316
STATEMENTS AND CONSTANTLY ASKING

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:47.952
ME FOR HUGS.

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:49.253
SHE FREQUENTLY BAD MATH BAD

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.688
MOUTH ANOTHER STUDENT WHOM HE

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:51.856
HAD ALSO ASSAULTED AND TOLD ME

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:53.558
THAT IT WAS IN MY BEST INTEREST

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:54.725
NOT TO ASSOCIATE WITH HER.

00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:55.893
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS I HAD TO

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.096
POINT OUT TO THE DEAN THAT SHE

00:34:58.162 --> 00:35:00.531
WAS HANDLING THE MANNER IN IT

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:03.401
UNPROFESSIONAL MANNER.

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:04.001
WHEN AMERICA'S FRIENDS BECAUSE

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:05.503
BEGAN THREATENING ME ON SOCIAL

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.137
MEDIA THE DâN ASSURED ME THAT

00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:07.505
HE WAS ALSO HAVING A VERY HARD

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:08.306
TIME WITH ALL OF IT?

00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:10.041
AND THAT HE HAD TO GO HOME EARLY

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:11.142
FOR THE DAY.

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:13.244
SHE PUT ME IN ANOTHER SURVIVOR

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:15.146
AND A HOTEL FOR THE WEEKEND.

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:16.447
AND TOLD US THAT WE'RE AND SAFE

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:18.549
IN OUR HOMES WHICH MADE US FEAR

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:19.517
FOR OUR LIVES EVERY DAY.

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:20.952
THE SCHOOL ISSUED THREE NO

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:22.520
CONTACT ORDERS BETWEEN MARY

00:35:22.587 --> 00:35:24.322
PERSONALLY AS WELL AS BETWEEN TO

00:35:24.388 --> 00:35:26.190
HIS FRIENDS IN THE HOOD BEEN

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:27.458
THREATENING ME.

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:28.092
THEY DIDN'T KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:28.993
HIS FRIENDS YET I HAD TO BE

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.428
SUPER CAREFUL WHERE I WENT OR I

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:31.796
COULD OTHERWISE RISK GETTING IN

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:33.998
TROUBLE FOR BEING AROUND THEM.

00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:35.766
I COULDN'T LEAVE MY HOUSE MUCH.

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:37.134
I NEVER MET THE INVESTIGATOR IN

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:38.736
THE MATTER BECAUSE SHE WAS AND

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:39.971
GERMAN BESSIE GATOR AND AS FAR

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:40.805
AS I KNOW.

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:42.940
SHE NEVER ACTUALLY CAME TO OUR

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:43.708
CAMPUS.

00:35:43.774 --> 00:35:45.776
THE WAY MY UNIVERSITY HANDLED MY

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:48.613
CASE IS SADLY NOT UNIQUE.

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:50.248
THEY PAID NO MIND TO THE FACT

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:50.915
THAT THEY WERE CONSTANTLY ASKING

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:53.217
ME. THREE LIVE ONE OF THE MOST

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:54.085
DIFFICULT DAYS OF MY LIFE.

00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:55.219
THE INVESTIGATOR RECALL ME

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:58.222
DURING CLASS EXPECT ME TO TALK

00:35:58.289 --> 00:35:58.823
ABOUT THE RAPE RIGHT THEN AND

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.858
THERE. TO SACRIFICE A LOT OF

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:02.527
TIME THAT I WANTED TO SPEND ON

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:03.461
SCHOOL WORK AND ROWING. TO

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:04.495
READING LOTS OF LONG AND

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:06.797
COMPLICATED DOCUMENTS THAT THEY

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:08.099
WERE ALWAYS SENDING ME.

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:10.668
I BECAME VERY DEPRESSED.

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:13.304
I THIRD FALLING BEHIND IN MY

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:13.938
CLASSES DUE TO THE TRAUMA OF THE

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:14.138
RAPE.

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:15.573
HOWEVER WHEN I REQUEST

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.308
ACCOMMODATIONS THE DEAN WOULD

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:17.708
NEVER SPONSORING.

00:36:17.775 --> 00:36:18.376
I'M A VERY PRIVATE PERSON AND IT

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:20.411
WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR ME

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:21.746
TO EXPLAIN THE EFFECT OF

00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:24.115
ASSAULTS ALL MY PROFESSORS.

00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:26.884
BUT THAT RESPONSIBILITY FALLS

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:28.753
SOLELY ON MY SHOULDERS.

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:29.987

BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT IF I

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:36.627
DIDN'T SETTLE.

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:38.362
THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO EXTEND

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:39.730
THE INVESTIGATION FOREVER.

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:40.831

PROCEDURES -- I WE GENERALLY

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.666
SUPPORT THE BILL BUT WE HAD TO

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:50.267
SAY WE HAVE POSTED.

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:51.502
TO THE STATE ON THE ON THE

00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:53.470
ANALYSIS BUT WE GENERALLY

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:54.305
SUPPORT IT BUT WE DO HAVE A

00:42:54.371 --> 00:42:56.240
COUPLE OF VERY VERY SERIOUS

00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:57.541
CONCERNS.

00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:59.643
BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF THE

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:00.244
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FAMILIES HAVE

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:01.578
COME TO US.

00:43:01.645 --> 00:43:03.247
OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS.

00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:04.882
THE FIRST ONE IS THE TRAUMA

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:06.750
INFORMED HEARINGS.

00:43:06.817 --> 00:43:09.053
ACCORDING TO THE BILL IT SAYS

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:10.421
THAT -- HEARINGS ARE TO BE

00:43:10.487 --> 00:43:11.221
TRAUMA INFORMED AND

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:13.157
INVESTIGATIONS ARE TO BE TRAUMA

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.124
INFORMED.

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:14.992
COMMON FORM THEORIES WERE

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:16.193
DEVELOPED AS A COUNSELING

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.262
TECHNIQUE AN INTERVIEW TECHNIQUE

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:19.930
TO HELP VICTIMS NOT BE

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:22.433
INTIMIDATED AND RECOGNIZE A BE

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:24.935
ABLE TO REMEMBER OR FAX.

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:26.904
AND IT'S PERFECT FOR THAT THAT'S

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:28.138
EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE USED.

00:43:28.205 --> 00:43:29.006
FOR PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD AS

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.874
VICTIMS SHOULD NOT BE GRILLED

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:32.543
SHOULD NOT BE INTIMIDATED.

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:34.945
IT HELPS THEIR MEMORY IF THEY'RE

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:36.280
ALLOWED TO STE RECOUNT THEIR

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:37.314
EXPERIENCES.

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:38.615
THE PROBLEM IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.584
MISS SUPPLYING TRAUMA INFORMED

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:41.986
THEORIES AND USING THEM TO

00:43:42.052 --> 00:43:44.588
EXCLUDE EVIDENCE FOR EXAMPLE.

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:46.490
IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE THE DATED

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:48.292
FOR SIX MONTHS THEY BREAK UP AND

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:50.260
LATER ONE FILES A CLAIM AGAINST

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:51.028
THE OTHER.

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:52.563
AND THE AND THE INCIDENT WAS

00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:58.969
HALFWAY THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE

00:43:59.036 --> 00:44:00.237
THAT RELATIONSHIP.

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.038
AND THE PERSON WHO'S ACCUSED

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:02.106
WILL SAY WELL WAIT A MINUTE YOU

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:02.740
KNOW WE HAD THIS ONGOING

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:03.507
RELATIONSHIP FOR THREE MORE

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:04.108
MONTHS IT SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS

00:44:04.174 --> 00:44:05.376
HAPPIER HE WAS HAPPY SOMETIMES.

00:44:05.442 --> 00:44:07.811
AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH -- YOU

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:09.246
KNOW EVERYTHING WAS GREAT.

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.248
THE INVESTIGATOR WILL SAY TO

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:12.383
THAT PERSON THE ACCUSED THAT'S A

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:14.084
RELEVANT.

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.285
WE DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:16.987
BECAUSE THAT CAN BE THE RESULT

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:19.189
OF TRAUMATIC BEHAVIOR.

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:21.525
PEOPLE THAT ARE VICTIMS ACT AND

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:23.961
GIVE INCONSISTENT STORIES.

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.529
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT ISN'T THAT

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:27.097
THAT ISN'T A POSSIBILITY YES

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:28.799
IT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEBODY

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:29.967
TRAUMATIZED MIGHT TELL

00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:31.535
INCONSISTENT STORIES OR BEHAVE

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:32.803
INCONSISTENTLY.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.238
THE PROBLEM IS IT'S A QUESTION

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:36.707
OF FACT FOR THE DECISION MAKER

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:38.876
IT'S NOT EVIDENCE TO BE EXCLUDED

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:40.310
AND WE HAVE CAL AT LEAST ONE

00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:41.945
CALIFORNIA CASE DIRECTLY ON THIS

00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:44.114
POINT WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL CASES

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:45.983
ACROSS UNITED STATES DIRECTLY ON

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:46.950
THIS POINT.

00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:49.053
THE CALIFORNIA CASE SAY THAT THE

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.421
TRADE THEY WEREN'T PROPERLY

00:44:50.487 --> 00:44:52.156
TRAIN BECAUSE THEY WERE TRAINED

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.457
IN THE TRAUMA AND FOR METHODS.

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:55.025
THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE THE

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:57.094
SECOND ISSUE AND I HAVE TO THANK

00:44:57.161 --> 00:44:58.729

EXAMINATION TO THE TO THE BILL

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:03.367
BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT STILL HAS

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:04.368
TO BE DONE.

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:05.903
ACCORDING TO THE BILL THROUGH

00:45:05.969 --> 00:45:07.037

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:16.513
EVER BECAUSE THAT PERSON OWES AN

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:20.150
OBLIGATION HAS A LEGAL DUTY TO

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:20.684
PROTECT THE STUDENT THEIR

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:21.552
QUESTIONING.

00:45:21.618 --> 00:45:23.020
WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND WE SEE THIS

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:24.321
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME?

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:26.356
IS THAT THE PERSON ASSIGNED WITH

00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:28.425
ASKING QUESTIONS DOES NOT ASK

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:29.560

SOFTEN THEM.

00:45:30.794 --> 00:45:32.596
AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY KIND

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:33.697
OF AN EFFECTIVE.

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:36.066

PREVALENCE OF THIS SITUATION.

00:50:29.559 --> 00:50:30.761
AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO

00:50:30.827 --> 00:50:32.028

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:33.363

POTENTIAL FALSE ALLEGATIONS I

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:51.314
THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER?

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.783
THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.384
PROCEEDING THIS IS A SCHOOL

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.052
MISCONDUCT PROCEEDING SO IT

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:58.889
ISN'T A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING --

00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:01.224
IN FACT VERY FEW WOMEN COME

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:03.894
FORWARD. TO IT TO DO THESE

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.762
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS --

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.497
BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR THAT THE

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.633
PROCESS WILL BE SIMILAR TO WHAT

00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:13.403
THIS YOUNG WOMAN EXPERIENCED

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.605
THERE ARE -- ALLEGED

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:17.107
PERPETRATORS WHO HAVE BEEN

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:18.475
HISTORICALLY OR OUR ACTIONS A

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.177
STARKLY IN SOME INSTANCES WHICH

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:22.312
I THINK WAS REFLECTED BY THE

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.381
TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESS HERE

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:24.614
TODAY.

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.616
PREVIOUSLY WHERE THE SYSTEMS

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:29.019
DIDN'T WORK FOR EITHER PARTY.

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:30.620
AND THIS BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:32.789
CREATE THAT THAT BALANCE OF DUE

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:35.592
PROCESS RECOGNIZING THIS IS AN

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:37.093
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING NOT A

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.295
CRIMINAL PROCEEDING.

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:40.230
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:43.166
PROCESS FOR ALL SCHOOLS TO FALL --

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.701
YOU KNOW SCHOOLS ARE EDUCATIONAL

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:46.570
INSTITUTIONS THEY'RE NOT COURTS

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.572
OF LAW PER SE WHAT THEY NEED IS

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:51.508
THEY NEED TO HAVE A SENSITIVITY

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:52.809
TO THE ISSUES.

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.778
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:58.482
A HEARING MECHANISM SO THAT --

00:51:58.548 --> 00:51:59.983
THAT EACH PARTY WILL HAVE A

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.586
RIGHT TO BE HEARD AND THE NEED

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:03.954
TO THOSE PARTIES BE PROTECTED --

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.655
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:08.892
BEEN VICTIMIZED -- THIS CAN BE A

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:11.294
HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE AND WE KNOW

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:13.396
HISTORICALLY OVER TIME THAT

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:14.898
SCHOOLS HAVE HAVE BEEN A LITTLE

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.166

PROTECT THOSE ACCUSED BUT IT

00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:15.559

FORWARD MENTAL HEALTH PART OF

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:14.596
ITS STAKE MOTHER PART OF IT IS

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:15.263
THEY KNOW WHEN THEY COME FORWARD

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:16.364
THEY DON'T GET HELP.

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:17.432
NOW I APPRECIATE THAT

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:18.733
PARTICULARLY ATTACKS STATE THEY

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.035
HAVE COME UP WITH THE SYSTEM TO

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.936
TRY TO GET THOSE STUDENTS AND

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:22.570
FIRST AND EARLY AS SOON AS THEY

01:22:22.637 --> 01:22:23.505
SHOW UP.

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:24.606
AND THAT CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:27.542
SEE AN ALL OF THE CSU CAMPUSES

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.345
HOWEVER I WOULD POINT OUT THAT --

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:32.981
THERE'S CLEARLY A NEED FOR FOR

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.049
MORE -- SERVICES THAT ARE.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.750
AVAILABLE AND I THINK WHEN YOU

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:37.552
THINK ABOUT THE RATE OF OF THE

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.620
MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:41.122
COLLEGE STUDENTS COMPARED.

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:43.692
TO YEAH WE THINK ABOUT ONE IN

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:44.859
FIFTEEN HUNDRED I MEAN YOU START

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:45.427
THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YEAH

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:45.994
YEAH.

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:47.228
WITH THE KIND OF NOW THEY COULD

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:49.898
YES THEY COULD HAVE SECURE

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:51.099
SUPPORT THEY CAN HELP WITH THAT.

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:52.033
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE HELP IN

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.201
THAT WILL STRETCH THAT WILL

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:54.569
PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT AND SO

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:57.072
FORTH BUT YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:58.606
KIND OF WAITING TIME THAT MEANS

01:22:58.673 --> 01:22:59.708
THAT A COUNSELOR WE FOR FROM

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:00.675
COUNSELOR HERE.

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.277
BUT THAT REALLY MEANS IF THEY

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:03.812
ACTUALLY HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:05.246
STUDENTS AND THINK ABOUT THE

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.815
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE THAT WILL

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:08.583
HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES --

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.118
THAT PIERRE AND AND SO EVEN IF

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:11.619
THEY CAN REFER SOMEBODY COUNTY

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:13.888
AND BY THE WAY -- THAT'S A

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:14.456
LITTLE BIT THE CHALLENGE --

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:16.758
BECAUSE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH THE

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:17.726
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY OVERSEAS.

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:19.394
ARE MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH

01:23:19.461 --> 01:23:20.695
SYSTEM OVER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:22.097
WELL WHAT YOU WHICH COUNTY DO

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.698
YOU ACTUALLY LIVE AND WHICH

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.066
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM DO A

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:26.768
SEND YOU TO BECAUSE THE ONE

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.269
YOU'RE AND MAY NOT NECESSARILY

IT CETERA.

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.539
SO I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:32.974
OF BABY IF CHALLENGES SO.

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:36.578
AT THAT POINT OUT THIS BILL SUCH

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:37.545
AS THE GOAL.

01:23:37.612 --> 01:23:38.646
I MEAN I AND AND I THINK THAT WE

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:39.714
HEAR FROM THE STUDENTS THEY

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.182
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ACCESS.

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:43.551
WE SET A GOAL WE WANT DATA.

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:44.853
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY REASONABLE

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:48.490
TO ASK OF THE CSU SYSTEM AND I

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:50.392
AND AND SO YOU KNOW I WANT TO

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:52.794

01:51:25.378 --> 01:51:27.547
UNFORTUNATELY I WAS UNABLE TO

GET THE METHOD OF CARE I HAD

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:29.716

GETTING AN ABORTION AT THAT

01:51:44.497 --> 01:51:46.066
HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE COST

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:47.333
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

01:51:52.705 --> 01:51:54.474
I NEEDED CARE QUICKLY.

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:55.141
BECAUSE I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE

COUNTRY. FOR MY STUDY ABROAD IN

01:51:57.544 --> 01:51:59.279

01:52:08.988 --> 01:52:10.857
WITH SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR I

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:12.058
COULD HAVE AVOIDED THREE

BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND CLINICS

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:18.264
THAT MADE MY EXPERIENCE

01:52:18.331 --> 01:52:20.400
STRESSFUL AND EXPENSIVE.

01:52:20.467 --> 01:52:21.701
HAD SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR BEEN

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:23.770
IN PLACE I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE

I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET MY

AND ULTIMATELY GET THE ABORTION

01:52:32.178 --> 01:52:34.013
PILL ALL IN ONE PLACE.

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.482
THE HEALTH CENTER WOULD HAVE

01:52:35.548 --> 01:52:36.850
ALSO KNOWN THAT MY STUDENT

01:52:40.553 --> 01:52:42.355
INSTEAD I WAS ALONE.

01:52:42.422 --> 01:52:43.890
CALLING CLINIC AFTER CLINIC

HELP.

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:53.433

STUDENTS ON BIRTH CONTROL CAN

01:52:56.703 --> 01:52:58.104
STILL GET PREGNANT.

01:52:58.171 --> 01:52:59.139
STUDENTS WILL ALWAYS NEED

01:52:59.205 --> 01:53:01.007

02:21:32.917 --> 02:21:36.754
PRETTY CLEAR -- CONCERNS AND HI

02:21:36.821 --> 02:21:38.823
I JUST.

02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:39.657
I JUST WANT TO REITERATE.

02:21:39.724 --> 02:21:42.193
THAT.

02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:45.496
THIS IS -- THERE'S THERE THERE

02:21:45.563 --> 02:21:50.568
THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED IN THIS --

02:21:50.635 --> 02:21:52.237
WHICH WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY OF

02:21:52.303 --> 02:21:54.873
HEALTH RISK -- WE'VE HEARD

02:21:54.939 --> 02:21:57.809
TESTIMONY LIABILITY RISK.

02:21:57.876 --> 02:21:58.843
I THINK THAT THE UNIVERSITIES

02:21:58.910 --> 02:22:01.346
ARE [inaudible]

02:22:01.412 --> 02:22:03.681
CAREFULLY.

02:22:03.748 --> 02:22:06.718
ARE COMMUNICATING WITH OF THIS.

02:22:06.784 --> 02:22:08.419
COMMITTEE ON THE BILL

02:22:08.486 --> 02:22:08.720
[inaudible]

02:22:08.786 --> 02:22:12.190

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:15.293
SOLVING THE COST QUESTION.

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:21.132
OR THE QUESTION OF STUDENT FEES --

02:22:21.199 --> 02:22:24.636
THIS I THINK HAS THE SAME KINDS

02:22:24.702 --> 02:22:25.236
OF PROBLEMS THAT THE PREVIOUS

02:22:25.303 --> 02:22:26.738

02:22:28.473 --> 02:22:31.442
GOING TO BE A NO VOTE AGAIN.

02:22:31.509 --> 02:22:35.813
BUT ALSO -- IT SEEMS TO ME THE

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:39.250
THAT THAT THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY.

02:22:39.317 --> 02:22:41.185
THE EFFORT TO INVOLVE THE

02:22:41.252 --> 02:22:43.888
UNIVERSITIES IN SOMETHING. FOR

02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:45.590
WHICH I THINK THE UNIVERSITIES

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:46.658
ARE [inaudible]

02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:48.559
TRYING.

02:22:48.626 --> 02:22:50.228
AND YET THEY ARE EXPRESSING THE

02:22:50.295 --> 02:22:51.729
KINDS OF CONCERNS OVER COST

02:22:51.796 --> 02:22:53.464
LIABILITY.

02:22:53.531 --> 02:22:55.233
PUSHING THIS OFF ON STUDENT FEES

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:58.169
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WHEN.

02:22:58.236 --> 02:22:59.671
BY BY THE TESTIMONY THE OF THE

02:22:59.737 --> 02:23:01.439

SEVERE AND FOURTEEN

02:25:16.441 --> 02:25:17.742
COMPLICATIONS OF THOSE CHILDREN

02:25:17.809 --> 02:25:22.080
BODY -- AND THE HOST COULD NOT

02:25:22.146 --> 02:25:23.981
BE -- RESPONSIBLE.

02:25:24.048 --> 02:25:25.349

02:25:26.350 --> 02:25:27.785
THAN WHEN AS SOON BECAUSE TO THE

02:25:27.852 --> 02:25:29.087
HEALTH CARE CENTER AND GETS A

02:25:29.153 --> 02:25:30.388
SUICIDE COUNSELING.

02:25:30.455 --> 02:25:32.056
IF THAT STUDENT THEN ULTIMATELY

02:25:32.123 --> 02:25:34.992
COMMITTED SUICIDE IS THE DISEASE --

02:25:35.059 --> 02:25:36.861
THE U. S. SEATS ISSUE ARE YOU

02:25:36.928 --> 02:25:38.096
SEE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

02:25:38.162 --> 02:25:39.263
SAID THE HEALTH CARE CENTERS

02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:41.799
ALSO OFFERED DIABETIC COUNSELING

02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:43.101
IF THE STUDENT WENT INTO A

02:25:43.167 --> 02:25:45.002
DIABETIC COMA WITH THE HEALTH

02:25:45.069 --> 02:25:46.571
CARE CENTER THEN BE RESPONSIBLE

02:25:46.637 --> 02:25:47.672
FOR THAT AS WELL.

02:25:47.738 --> 02:25:50.475
SO IT'S SIMILAR TO THOSE ISSUES.

02:25:50.541 --> 02:25:52.577
AND AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

02:25:52.643 --> 02:25:54.112
THE STUDENT RECEIVES A MEDICATED

02:25:54.178 --> 02:25:55.780

ON CAMPUS OR OFF CAMPUS THEY

02:25:59.283 --> 02:26:02.987
WILL STILL BE GOING BACK TO

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:04.989
THEIR DORM ROOM [inaudible]

02:26:05.056 --> 02:26:09.827
I PERSONALLY FEEL -- THAT --

02:26:09.894 --> 02:26:12.163
THIS KIND OF ISSUE IS SOME MORE

02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:13.097
PERSONAL.

02:26:13.164 --> 02:26:15.533
RATHER THAN INSTITUTION THE

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:17.401
CAMPUS IS.

02:26:17.468 --> 02:26:19.604
OUT WOULD HAVE TO STEP IN.

02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:22.406
AND THAT ENCOURAGE AND HELP ON

02:26:22.473 --> 02:26:23.541
HOW TO CONDUCT.

02:26:23.608 --> 02:26:27.178
THEM.

02:26:27.245 --> 02:26:30.548
IT IS ACTUALLY -- BEAUJON.

02:26:30.615 --> 02:26:32.450
AND SO IT IS A SOLEMN NOW MY

02:26:32.517 --> 02:26:34.318
MORAL ISSUE A WOULD NOT BE ABLE

02:26:34.385 --> 02:26:34.785
TO SUPPORT [inaudible]

02:26:34.852 --> 02:26:37.822

THIS FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS A

02:26:45.663 --> 02:26:47.365
DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR MANY OF

02:26:47.431 --> 02:26:50.268
FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY

02:26:50.334 --> 02:26:50.635
ARE COMPLETE.

02:26:50.701 --> 02:26:52.470
THE BASIC INFLATING THE ISSUE

02:26:52.537 --> 02:26:53.704
WITH THE NORMAL ABORTION THAT

02:26:53.771 --> 02:26:55.339
YOU SEE THAT HAPPENS IN A

02:26:55.406 --> 02:26:57.341
HOSPITAL MEDICAL FACILITY WHERE

02:26:57.408 --> 02:26:57.909
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT MORE

02:26:57.975 --> 02:26:58.876
STAFFING.

02:26:58.943 --> 02:27:00.344
AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH

02:27:00.411 --> 02:27:02.079
THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:27:02.146 --> 02:27:04.415
ALREADY EXIST -- WITH IS A BLOCK

02:27:04.482 --> 02:27:05.816
FROM CAMPUS OR A MILE FROM

02:27:05.883 --> 02:27:08.853
CAMPUS THE SAME PROCEDURES THERE.

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:09.820
AND THE SAME RISK IS THE S. OUR

02:27:09.887 --> 02:27:11.556
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

02:27:11.622 --> 02:27:15.259
INVOLVED IN THAT -- YOU KNOW

02:27:15.326 --> 02:27:16.994
HAVING SPENT -- MOST OF MY LIFE

02:27:17.061 --> 02:27:18.162
FOR THE UNIVERSITY WORKING WITH

02:27:18.229 --> 02:27:19.764
STUDENTS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS.

02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:21.699
OF AND HAVING BEEN INVOLVED WITH

02:27:21.766 --> 02:27:23.234
A NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE IN

02:27:23.301 --> 02:27:25.336
A CRISIS SUCH AS THIS -- I KNOW

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:26.637
THAT IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME FOR

02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:28.673
THEM AND THE FRIENDLY PLACE TO

02:27:28.739 --> 02:27:30.274
BE IS A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:32.677
MOST COMFORTABLE AND AND FEEL

02:27:32.743 --> 02:27:33.911
THEY KNOW THE INDIVIDUALS.

02:27:33.978 --> 02:27:34.545
HAVE HAD STUDENTS WHO HAVE TO

02:27:34.612 --> 02:27:36.180
TRAVEL OFF CAMPUS AND IT WASN'T

02:27:36.247 --> 02:27:37.882
HOURS AND HOURS THAT THEY HAD TO

02:27:37.949 --> 02:27:39.083
GO AS WE RIGHT IN THE HEART OF

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:40.351
SAN DIEGO.

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:41.786
BUT THEY WERE GOING TO A A PLACE

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:43.321
THEY DID THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH.

02:27:43.387 --> 02:27:44.222
OFTENTIMES THESE ARE STUDENTS

02:27:44.288 --> 02:27:45.756
WHO COME TO THIS CAMPUS WHO KNOW

02:27:45.823 --> 02:27:47.325
VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE CITY OTHER

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:49.160
THAN THE IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT

02:27:49.227 --> 02:27:49.727
WHERE THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND

02:27:49.794 --> 02:27:51.229
WHETHER PART IT IS BUT THEY HAVE

02:27:51.295 --> 02:27:52.430
NO.

02:27:52.496 --> 02:27:53.698
REAL CONNECTIONS TO THE MEDICAL

02:27:53.764 --> 02:27:54.899
A COMMUNITY OR ANYTHING LIKE

02:27:54.966 --> 02:27:56.400
THAT IN THEIR ONLY SOURCE REALLY

02:27:56.467 --> 02:27:57.768
OF MEDICAL CARE IS THE STUDENT

02:27:57.835 --> 02:27:58.569
CENTER.

02:27:58.636 --> 02:28:00.071
AND THEY HANDLE A LOT OF

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:02.139
DIFFERENT ISSUES I MEAN IT'S NOT

02:28:02.206 --> 02:28:03.541
THAT THEY GO IS JUST FOR COLDER

02:28:03.608 --> 02:28:04.976
THE FLU THEY HANDLE AN AWFUL LOT

02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:07.245
OF STUDENT ISSUES AND ILLNESSES

02:28:07.311 --> 02:28:09.013
THAT OCCUR -- ESPECIALLY FOR THE

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.048
FIRST YEAR STUDENTS WHO WHO MAY

02:28:11.115 --> 02:28:12.416
HAVE SOME FORM OF HEPATITIS A

02:28:12.483 --> 02:28:14.285
MAY HAVE ALL OF THE KINDS OF

02:28:14.352 --> 02:28:16.254
BILLS ILLNESSES STDS YOU NAME IT.

02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:17.922
AND THE CAMPUSES HAVE TO HANDLE

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:19.457
ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND THEY ARE

02:28:19.523 --> 02:28:21.025
AS PROFESSIONAL ENOUGH TO KNOW

02:28:21.092 --> 02:28:22.460
WHICH ONES CAN BE HANDLED THERE

02:28:22.526 --> 02:28:23.728
AND WHICH ONE SHOULD BE HANDLE

02:28:23.794 --> 02:28:24.495
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

02:28:24.562 --> 02:28:25.930
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS

02:28:25.997 --> 02:28:28.499
BILL COMES WITH THE SONOGRAM OF

02:28:28.566 --> 02:28:29.533
FORUMS TO MAKE IT SO THAT WE

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:33.170
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND

02:28:33.237 --> 02:28:34.372
AND SOLD ACT I STRONGLY.

02:28:34.438 --> 02:28:35.473
RECOMMEND THAT WE WE MOVED WITH

02:28:35.539 --> 02:28:36.841
THIS BILL MAINLY BECAUSE IT

02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:39.243
REALLY IS AN ISSUE OF ACCESS NO

02:28:39.310 --> 02:28:40.745
SHE MORE THAN THE ISSUE OF PRO

02:28:40.811 --> 02:28:41.712
LIFE OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THOSE

02:28:41.779 --> 02:28:42.313
ARE.

02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:43.547
ISSUES THAT ARE BEING RESOLVED

02:28:43.614 --> 02:28:49.720
OR EITHER NEVER GOING TO BE

02:28:49.787 --> 02:28:50.688
RESOLVED. TO EVERYONE'S

02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:51.555
SATISFACTION BUT AS LONG AS THEY

02:28:51.622 --> 02:28:53.291
ARE THIS IS LEGAL AND IT IS AS

02:28:53.357 --> 02:28:53.924
SIMPLE AS IT IS IT MAY SOUNDS

02:28:53.991 --> 02:28:54.659
DIFFICULT FOR US IN THIS

02:28:54.725 --> 02:28:55.459
GENERATION.

02:28:55.526 --> 02:28:57.495
BUT IT'S A SIMPLE AS IT IS -- WE

02:28:57.561 --> 02:28:58.796
HAVE TO BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT

02:28:58.863 --> 02:29:00.331
IT THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO

02:29:00.398 --> 02:29:01.565
IT.

02:29:01.632 --> 02:29:03.167
AND I'VE SEEN STUDENTS WHERE.

02:29:03.234 --> 02:29:03.934
THEY HAD TO MAKE DIFFICULT

02:29:04.001 --> 02:29:05.269
CHOICES THEY'RE MAKING A

02:29:05.336 --> 02:29:07.171
DIFFICULT CHOICE ANY TIME THAT

02:29:07.238 --> 02:29:07.938
THEY'RE PREGNANT AND THEIR

02:29:08.005 --> 02:29:09.507
STUDENT AT MERRITT ON CAMPUS

02:29:09.573 --> 02:29:10.341
THEY MAKE DIFFICULT CHOICES

02:29:10.408 --> 02:29:11.942
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I

02:29:12.009 --> 02:29:13.444
DON'T IMMEDIATELY BUT TO THEM IN

02:29:13.511 --> 02:29:14.412
THE FUTURE.

02:29:14.478 --> 02:29:16.013
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:17.581
ENTER INTO LIGHTLY AS MOST FOLKS

02:29:17.648 --> 02:29:18.983
THINK THEY DO AND I'VE HAD

02:29:19.050 --> 02:29:20.284
STUDENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:21.852
ISSUE WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON

02:29:21.919 --> 02:29:23.454
DECIDED NOT TO CONTINUE WITH THE

02:29:23.521 --> 02:29:24.155
PREGNANCY.

02:29:24.221 --> 02:29:25.556
I'VE HAD STUDENTS ON THE OTHER

02:29:25.623 --> 02:29:27.358
SIDE WHO CONTINUE TO TERMINATE

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:29.060
WHO WHO TERMINATE A PREGNANCY

02:29:29.126 --> 02:29:30.494
AND EACH ONE IT WAS A VERY

02:29:30.561 --> 02:29:31.762
DIFFICULT AND A PERSONAL

02:29:31.829 --> 02:29:32.997
DECISION.

02:29:33.064 --> 02:29:35.266
AND EACH ONE'S LIFE IT WAS OF AN

02:29:35.333 --> 02:29:36.867
IMPACTED BY IT OF SO THAT

02:29:36.934 --> 02:29:39.170
STUDENTS WHO FELT THAT WAS THE

02:29:39.236 --> 02:29:39.837
ONLY THING THEY HAD AVAILABLE TO

02:29:39.904 --> 02:29:40.604
THEM.

02:29:40.671 --> 02:29:41.872
FOR ECONOMIC REASONS AND A HOST

02:29:41.939 --> 02:29:43.407
OF OTHER THINGS HAD TO MAKE

02:29:43.474 --> 02:29:45.276
PEACE WITH THE DECISIONS THAT

02:29:45.343 --> 02:29:46.610
THEY MAY AND MOVED ON WITH THEIR

02:29:46.677 --> 02:29:48.179
LIFE AND SOME OF THEM STILL

02:29:48.245 --> 02:29:48.546
WRITE ME TODAY.

02:29:48.612 --> 02:29:50.181
WHO'S NOW MARRIED AND HAD KIDS

02:29:50.247 --> 02:29:51.182
AND ALL THOSE THINGS AND OTHERS

02:29:51.248 --> 02:29:52.983
WHO HAVE THE CHILDREN STILL

02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:54.285
WRITE ME TO WOULD DAY WITH A

02:29:54.352 --> 02:29:55.252
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID THAT THEY

02:29:55.319 --> 02:29:56.520
HAD WHEN THEY WERE IN COLLEGE

02:29:56.587 --> 02:29:58.089
BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION.

02:29:58.155 --> 02:29:59.290
AND I THINK WE SHOULD NOT MAKE

02:29:59.357 --> 02:30:00.925
IT MORE COMPLICATED OR PUT IN

02:30:00.991 --> 02:30:03.327
OBSTACLES IN PEOPLE'S WAY WHEN

02:30:03.394 --> 02:30:04.195
THEY'RE HAVING SOME LIFE

02:30:04.261 --> 02:30:05.496
DECISIONS THAT HAVE TO BE MADE.

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:07.131
BASED ON THEIR VALUES BASED ON

02:30:07.198 --> 02:30:08.632
THEIR FAMILY BASED ON THEIR

02:30:08.699 --> 02:30:09.600
NEEDS AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME

02:30:09.667 --> 02:30:10.868
LIKE I SAID HAVING GONE THROUGH

02:30:10.935 --> 02:30:12.370
THIS WITH A NUMBER OF MY

02:30:12.436 --> 02:30:13.337
STUDENTS.

02:30:13.404 --> 02:30:14.972
I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT AN EASY

02:30:15.039 --> 02:30:16.774
TASK IN MY JOB WAS NEVER TO TELL

02:30:16.841 --> 02:30:17.541
THEM WHAT TO DO.

02:30:17.608 --> 02:30:18.743
BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:30:18.809 --> 02:30:19.944
THOUGHT IT THROUGH KNEW WHAT

02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:21.479
THEY WANTED TO DO AND IF THEY

02:30:21.545 --> 02:30:23.614
NEEDED MORE SUPPORT TO PROVIDE

02:30:23.681 --> 02:30:26.550
THAT MORAL SUPPORT FOR THEM --

02:30:26.617 --> 02:30:28.285
IT IS -- AND SO I RECOMMEND THAT

02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:28.953
WEEK THAT THIS BILL IS SOMETHING

02:30:29.019 --> 02:30:30.454
THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH MY

02:30:30.521 --> 02:30:31.422
COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY.

02:30:31.489 --> 02:30:34.125
MOVED IT I SEE MY GOOD FRIEND

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:36.594
ARAMBULA WHO IS THE A POSITION

02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:38.095
WHO KNOWS HOW UNCOMPLICATED THIS

02:30:38.162 --> 02:30:39.930
CAN BE BUT WE DON'T WANT TO

02:30:39.997 --> 02:30:40.798
COMPLICATED MORE IN TERMS OF THE

02:30:40.865 --> 02:30:42.133
LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE THIS IS A

02:30:42.199 --> 02:30:43.334
VERY PERSONAL.

02:30:43.401 --> 02:30:49.440
DIFFICULT DECISION THE FACT THAT --

02:30:49.507 --> 02:30:50.908
STUDENTS TRIED GET IT DONE THE

02:30:50.975 --> 02:30:52.443
NORMAL PROCESS WHAT WE SAY WELL

02:30:52.510 --> 02:30:53.677
ORGANIZED GET YOUR CAMPUS

02:30:53.744 --> 02:30:54.345

PUT TOGETHER GOOD PROPOSAL HELP

RAISE MONEY BLAH BLAH THEY TRIED

02:30:57.681 --> 02:30:58.282
ALL THAT AND RAN INTO A WALL AND

02:30:58.349 --> 02:30:58.916
SOMETIMES THOSE WALLS ARE MORE

02:30:58.983 --> 02:30:59.950
POLITICAL THAN THEY ARE ANYTHING

02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:00.818
ELSE MEDICAL.

02:31:00.885 --> 02:31:02.787
AND AND SO THEN IT BECOMES OUR

02:31:02.853 --> 02:31:04.088
RESPONSIBILITY ASK QUESTIONS

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:05.756
WILL STUDENTS REALLY NEED ON THE

02:31:05.823 --> 02:31:07.158
CAMPUS STUDENTS AT THE CAP

02:31:07.224 --> 02:31:09.260
WONDERFUL HEALTH FACILITIES --

02:31:09.326 --> 02:31:09.894
SOME FOLKS EVEN OPPOSED TO THAT

02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:11.195
THAT WE HAVE HEALTH FACILITIES

02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:13.130
ON CAMPUS IS -- BUT WE

02:31:13.197 --> 02:31:14.698
DISCOVERED THAT THE CAMPUS IN

02:31:14.765 --> 02:31:16.300
FALL APART BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE A

02:31:16.367 --> 02:31:17.968
NICE CLINIC ON CAMPUS THAT MEETS

02:31:18.035 --> 02:31:18.536
THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS

02:31:18.602 --> 02:31:20.037
BECAUSE STUDENTS COME FROM

02:31:20.104 --> 02:31:21.038
EVERYWHERE AND THEY NEED HELP

02:31:21.105 --> 02:31:22.406
THEY NEED SUPPORT.

02:31:22.473 --> 02:31:23.307
AND THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS

02:31:23.374 --> 02:31:25.042
COMPLICATION WHEN THEY HAVE A

02:31:25.109 --> 02:31:26.210
CRISIS IN THEIR LIFE AND THEY

02:31:26.277 --> 02:31:27.678

TO DEAL WITH THE RESOURCES THAT

02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:37.555
ARE THERE -- THAT'S NECESSARY TO

YEARS OLD IN SEVENTH GRADE.

02:47:29.672 --> 02:47:31.274
I GOT OUT FOR A MONTH AND THEN

02:47:31.341 --> 02:47:33.476
WENT BACK IN AND LITERALLY DID

02:47:33.543 --> 02:47:34.544

02:47:36.946 --> 02:47:38.181
WHILE I WAS IN THE CAMP

02:47:38.248 --> 02:47:39.649
EDUCATION WAS SO HARD FOR ME IT

02:47:39.716 --> 02:47:41.184
WAS ONE CURRICULUM FOR EVERYONE

02:47:41.251 --> 02:47:42.051
AND I WAS LEARNING WHAT THE

02:47:42.118 --> 02:47:43.319
OTHER GIRLS WERE LEARNING EVEN

02:47:43.386 --> 02:47:44.721
THOUGH THEY WERE MUCH OLDER.

02:47:44.788 --> 02:47:45.622
THAN A LOT OF THE GIRLS

02:47:45.688 --> 02:47:47.357
GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHILE

02:47:47.424 --> 02:47:48.291
THEY WERE STILL IN CUSTODY.

02:47:48.358 --> 02:47:49.659
AND AFTER THE GRADUATION THEY

02:47:49.726 --> 02:47:50.927
STILL CAME TO COURT SCHOOL WITH

02:47:50.994 --> 02:47:52.028
THOSE BUT THEY SAT IN THE BACK

02:47:52.095 --> 02:47:53.530
OF THE CLASSROOM AND DID NOTHING

02:47:53.596 --> 02:47:55.131
BUT COLORING AND WRITING IN

JOURNALS OR WRITING LETTERS.

02:47:56.766 --> 02:47:57.467

02:47:59.169 --> 02:48:00.804
NOTEBOOKS ARE EDUCATION PROGRAMS

02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:01.905
WERE OFFERED TO THEM.

02:48:01.971 --> 02:48:03.106
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FAIR

02:48:03.173 --> 02:48:04.541
BECAUSE I BECAME CLOSE THOSE

02:48:04.607 --> 02:48:06.476

02:48:06.543 --> 02:48:07.343

02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:14.451
HELP US.

02:48:14.517 --> 02:48:15.752
IT DIDN'T GIVE ME MOTIVATION

02:48:15.819 --> 02:48:17.020
BECAUSE THESE INTELLIGENT GIRLS

02:48:17.086 --> 02:48:17.887
HAD JUST FINISHED HER HIGH

02:48:17.954 --> 02:48:19.923
SCHOOL EDUCATION AND THERE WAS

02:48:19.989 --> 02:48:21.257
NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO WITH IT.

02:48:21.324 --> 02:48:22.425
WE TALKED ABOUT THEM GOING TO

02:48:22.492 --> 02:48:23.626

02:48:26.129 --> 02:48:27.297

NO RESOURCES NO REAL OPPORTUNITY

02:48:29.732 --> 02:48:31.100

ADVOCATE THE USE LAWCENTER.

02:49:29.259 --> 02:49:30.260
SO YOU HEARD MS RODRIGUEZ'S

02:49:30.326 --> 02:49:31.261
TESTIMONY -- I WISH THAT HER

02:49:31.327 --> 02:49:32.462
EXPERIENCE WAS UNIQUE BUT IT IS

02:49:32.529 --> 02:49:33.196
NOT.

02:49:33.263 --> 02:49:34.664
THERE'S A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF

02:49:34.731 --> 02:49:37.534
YOUTH WHO ARE IN CUSTODY HAVE

02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:39.502
THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS AND

02:49:39.569 --> 02:49:41.771
HAVE NO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING

02:49:41.838 --> 02:49:44.741
FOR THEM -- A BILL WAS PASSED IN

02:49:44.807 --> 02:49:45.408
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT ALLOWS

02:49:45.475 --> 02:49:47.477
YOUNG PEOPLE -- IN CUSTODY TO

02:49:47.544 --> 02:49:49.913
GRADUATE WITH MINIMUM STATE

02:49:49.979 --> 02:49:50.246
REQUIREMENTS.

02:49:50.313 --> 02:49:52.348
AND THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUNG

02:49:52.415 --> 02:49:54.751
PEOPLE IN CUSTODY WHO HAVE THEIR

02:49:54.817 --> 02:49:56.085
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS.

02:49:56.152 --> 02:49:58.621
IS ANYWHERE FROM BETWEEN TEN AND

02:49:58.688 --> 02:50:00.089
15% IN THE COUNTY FACILITIES BUT

02:50:00.156 --> 02:50:03.593
AS HIGH AS 50% IN THE STATE

02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:05.061
FACILITIES.

02:50:05.128 --> 02:50:05.728
AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE

02:50:05.795 --> 02:50:07.330
HAVE SOME POST SECONDARY ED

02:50:07.397 --> 02:50:10.500
PROGRAMS ALREADY IN FACILITIES --

02:50:10.567 --> 02:50:11.434
AROUND THE STATE WE HAVE SOME

02:50:11.501 --> 02:50:13.336
MODEL PROGRAMS AND THEY ARE

02:50:13.403 --> 02:50:15.371
DOING WHAT THE SENATOR MENTIONED

02:50:15.438 --> 02:50:16.506
WHICH IS.

02:50:16.573 --> 02:50:18.241
THEY ARE ALLOWING YOUNG PEOPLE

02:50:18.308 --> 02:50:20.243
TO TAKE ONLINE CLASSES IN

02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:22.712
CUSTODY AND THEN WHEN THEY LEAVE

02:50:22.779 --> 02:50:24.681
THE FACILITY CONTINUED TAKING

02:50:24.747 --> 02:50:26.583
THOSE ONLINE COURSES WHEN THEY

02:50:26.649 --> 02:50:27.517
COME OUT.

02:50:27.584 --> 02:50:29.519
SO NO CHALLENGES WITH REGARD TO

02:50:29.586 --> 02:50:30.587
SCHEDULING IT DOES TAKE SOME

02:50:30.653 --> 02:50:33.156
FLEXIBILITY -- BUT THEY'RE ABLE

02:50:33.222 --> 02:50:33.990
TO DO IT.

02:50:34.057 --> 02:50:35.158
AND WE TALKED ABOUT COSTS

02:50:35.224 --> 02:50:37.694
ALREADY SO I WON'T I WON'T GO

02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:40.730
INTO THAT -- AND BUT WHAT I

02:50:40.797 --> 02:50:42.699
WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT THESE

02:50:42.765 --> 02:50:44.200
YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO CONTINUE

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:45.535
THEIR EDUCATION.

02:50:45.602 --> 02:50:47.637
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO RE

02:50:47.704 --> 02:50:49.472
ENVISION THEMSELVES.

02:50:49.539 --> 02:50:50.940
SO WE WE REALLY SHOULDN'T

02:50:51.007 --> 02:50:52.075
PENALIZE THEM FOR BEING

02:50:52.141 --> 02:50:54.677
MOTIVATED TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL

02:50:54.744 --> 02:50:56.579
WHILE IN CUSTODY GIVEN

02:50:56.646 --> 02:50:57.847
ESPECIALLY GIVEN ALL THE

02:50:57.914 --> 02:50:59.182
CHALLENGES ARE FACING.

02:50:59.248 --> 02:51:00.917
SO RATHER THAN PENALIZE THEM LET

02:51:00.984 --> 02:51:02.518
SUPPORT THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR

02:51:02.585 --> 02:51:04.554
EDUCATION WITHOUT DELAY AND WITH

02:51:04.621 --> 02:51:06.055
THE TIME THEY HAVE WHILE THEY

02:51:06.122 --> 02:51:08.157
ARE STILL IN CUSTODY.

02:51:08.224 --> 02:51:09.425
