FOR REPORTING.

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:20.245
THE CRITICAL THAT ON THE

00:31:20.311 --> 00:31:21.246
HOMELESSNESS THAT WE NEED TO

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:24.115
THINK TO SOLVE THE THE PROBLEM --

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.650
SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.652
IMPORTANT THAT -- WE INCLUDE

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.187

THE CURRENT PROJECTED SUPPLY

00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:37.629
VERY SICK COMBINATION UNITS FOR

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:39.464
HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.833
SECURE POPULATIONS -- AND THE

SHELTER BEDS WITHIN EACH COUNTY.

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:49.274
I THINK THAT THE MORE WE COLLECT

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.708
THIS DATA THE MORE THAT WE HAVE

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:52.176

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:18.102
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.070

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:20.872
APPROPRIATE AND I VERY MUCH

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:21.806

THE ASSEMBLY SIDE INTO HOPE THAT --

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:26.611
WE WILL HAVE FRUITFUL

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:28.279
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.214
BRANCHES A FEW THINGS THAT I

00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.449
JUST WANNA MENTION FROM MY

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:33.084
STANDPOINT -- HALF A BILLION

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:34.285

TAX CREDIT -- WE CERTAINLY NEED

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:37.989
THAT -- THE ONE THING I WOULD

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:40.325
SAY IS MY HOPE IS THAT IT'S NOT

00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:42.026
JUST ABOUT INCREASING THE AMOUNT

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:43.428
OF THE CREDIT FOR ONE YEAR

00:32:43.494 --> 00:32:44.862
BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S ENOUGH

IT'S BEEN PROPOSED IN THIS

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.835
YEAR'S BUDGET -- BUT AS I'VE

BEEN PROPOSING FOR NUMBER OF

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.870
YEARS AND I THINK THERE'S

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:54.138
TREMENDOUS SUPPORT AROUND THE

00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:55.406
STATE WIDE.

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.108
IN OUR HOUSING.

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:58.142
DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY.

00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.377
WE NEED TO HAVE AN ON GOING

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:01.579
BASIS FOR AN INCREASE IN THE TAX

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:02.747
CREDIT WE KNOW THAT AFFORDABLE

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:04.649
HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE PLANNING

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:06.150
THEIR FINANCING YEARS IN ADVANCE

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:07.685
WE KNOW THAT BANKS.

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:09.253
THAT PURCHASED THESE TAX CREDITS

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.522

CREDITS ARE AVAILABLE IT'S

00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:15.493
IMPORTANT PROVIDE SOME

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.228
PREDICTABILITY TO THE MARKET

00:33:17.295 --> 00:33:18.730
PLACE AND I THINK THAT WE NEED

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:20.131
TO THINK ABOUT.

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:20.698
HOW WE MAKE THE TAX RATE ON

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:22.500
GOING -- I WANNA SAY WITH

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:24.902
REGARDS -- TO THE MONEY THAT'S

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:26.170
BEING PROPOSED FOR MISSING

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:28.439
MIDDLE PRODUCTION IT IS.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:30.041
AN AREA THAT I WOULD SUPPORT I

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:32.110
WOULD JUST MENTION -- THAT WE

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:32.944
HAVE HAD A PROPOSAL FOR A NUMBER

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.445
OF YEARS TO HELP AND SENT

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:35.513
MISSING MIDDLE PRODUCTION

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.316
THROUGH AB -- SEVENTEEN THIRTY

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:40.318
FOUR THAT WOULD -- PROPOSE A

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:42.620
PROPERTY TAX WELL FOR EXEMPTION

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.856
IN RETURN FOR A COMMITMENT --

00:33:44.922 --> 00:33:47.058
THAT A DEVELOPER BE ABLE TO

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:48.926
DEVELOP -- RENTS AND OR OR

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:50.228
PRODUCTION THAT -- INVOLVES

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:51.996
UNITS WITH RENTS BELOW MARKET

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:53.998
RATE I THINK THAT'S THE SORT OF

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.199
STRUCTURE WE MAY WANT TO

00:33:55.266 --> 00:33:55.800
CONSIDER GIVING THAT THIS IS

00:33:55.867 --> 00:34:01.639
PRODUCTION -- THAT WOULD NOT

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:02.673
LEVERAGE OTHER TYPES OF FUNDING.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.608
WITH REGARDS TO THE INCREASE

00:34:03.674 --> 00:34:04.742
HOMELESSNESS DOLLARS -- THERE

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:05.610
WERE DISCUSSING CERTAINLY AGAIN

00:34:05.676 --> 00:34:06.978
SUPPORT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:08.513
BUT I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:09.881
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN ONE

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:11.015
TIME FUNDING.

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:12.049
AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:13.184
HOMELESSNESS WHEN WE KNOW THAT

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:14.452
HOMELESSNESS IS NOT SOMETHING

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:15.520
THAT'S GOING TO GET SOLVED

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:16.821
OVERNIGHT AND I THINK WE NEED TO

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:18.289
THINK A BIT MORE STRATEGICALLY

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:20.458
ABOUT THIS -- AS FAR AS A MANY

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.026
THE HE PROGRAM AND I DO

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:22.794
APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON THE

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.828
PROGRAM.

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:24.962
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:26.931
MAINTAIN FOR FLEXIBILITY BUT WE

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:29.434
ALSO FOCUS ON EVIDENCE SPACES

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.902
EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES TO

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.036
HOMELESSNESS THAT WORK.

00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:33.805
LONG TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE

00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:35.273
PROJECT BASED HOUSING VOUCHERS

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:36.707
TIED TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING.

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:37.842
OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.310
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:40.745
AND EMERGENCY SHELTERS IN

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:42.346
ADDITIONAL IN ADDITION A FUNNY

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:43.714
NAVIGATION CENTERS.

00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:45.716
WE HAVE TO THINK OF HOW WE T&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:47.018
PROGRAM FUNDS TO OUTCOMES IT

00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:48.553
MOVE PEOPLE TO PERMANENT HOUSING

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:49.687
SOLUTIONS.

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.155
AND I THINK FOCUS A GOOD CHUNK

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.190
OF THIS MONEY ON CHRONICALLY

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:54.492
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND THEN I

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:56.160
WOULD JUST ECHO WHAT -- MS WICKS

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:57.195
JUST SAID ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

00:34:57.261 --> 00:35:00.198
OF COLLECTING DATA I KNOW THAT --

00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:01.766
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR A

00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:03.000
NUMBER OF YEARS AND EIGHT CD IS

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:05.736
TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH -- A

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:07.371
STATE DATA WAREHOUSE SO THAT WE

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:09.106
COORDINATE STATE ILLEGAL RE

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:10.308
LOCAL RESOURCES TO RESPOND

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:12.076
HOMELESSNESS I ALSO THINK WE

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:13.878
HAVE TO FULLY STAFF THE HOMELESS

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:15.246
FINANCING AND COORDINATING

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:17.415
COUNCIL SO THEY CAN REALLY FOR

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:18.683
FILL THEIR ROLE.

ALLOCATED FUNDS.

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.201
THE ONLY PLACE WHERE LOW INCOME

ADDRESS THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM.

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:26.557
WHEN WE FAIL TO STIR FAMILIES OF

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.392
THE LOWEST INCOMES WE ONLY GROW

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:29.627
OUR POPULATION EXPERIENCING

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:30.628
HOMELESSNESS?

00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:32.263
AND ON THAT NOTE HOUSING

CALIFORNIANS USERS ARE EXCITED

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:35.699

HOMELESSNESS.

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:38.369
BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:40.137
WITH THE STRUCTURE PROPOSED HERE.

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:41.238

FINDING MORE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS.

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:52.216
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:53.317

00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:54.652

DECREASE HOMELESSNESS.

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.758
THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF STATED THAT

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:01.826

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.322
WITH THE DATA THAT THAT FRANKLY

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:01.857

THE DATA THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:22.111
