HEARING NO INTEREST -- QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MR MARLA -- THANK YOUR CINNAMON RODRIGUEZ FOR INDULGING ME. OUR MISTER POMEROY MAYBE I COULD ASK YOU -- FOR THE C. E. A THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. IS. A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION -- NO CENTER THE THE SEA IS A CREATURE OF STATE STATUTE AND THAT WAS ESTABLISHED -- BACK IN THE MID NINETIES AT ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DID WAS APPROACH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. TO RECEIVE A PRIVATE LETTER RULING SO WE ARE TAX EXEMPT BUT NOT WE ARE NOT TECHNICALLY FIVE ONE C.. THREE WERE TEXAS THAT BY VIRTUE OF A PRIVATE LETTER RULING FROM THE IRS. AND IS IS ARE YOU MANDATED TO PROVIDE GRANTS. FOR THIS PROGRAM. IN A SENSE THAT WOULD THAT WENT THE AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION FOR THE C.. EIGHT CORRECTED THAT 5% OF OUR INVESTMENT INCOME. UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. BE USED TO FUND MITIGATION EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA THE THAT WAS PARTY NAMELY STATUES BACK IN THE MID NINETIES. SO IN THAT THIS ORGANIZATION TRIED A NUMBER OF THINGS OVER THE YEARS TO FULFILL THAT MANDATE -- BACK IN -- WITH HE WAS TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY TWELVE OR THIRTEEN WOULD BE IN A DEVELOP THIS EARTHQUAKE BREATHABLE PROGRAM TO TO TO TO GIVE MEANING TO THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. AND SINCE THEN HAVE DEVELOPED THIS PROGRAM -- RETREATED EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES SO FAR. AS A RESULT OF THE EARTHQUAKE REASONABLE PROGRAM -- FOUR THOUSAND AND IN THE IN LA COUNTY AND FOURTH ON THE NORTH. AND OUR INTEREST IS TO CONTINUE TO GROW INTO MORE [inaudible] BUT THEN. THIS THIS GRANT PROGRAM IS PART OF YOUR MANDATE BUT IT ISN'T FOR OUR ANY [inaudible] INTERNAL REVENUE. SERVICE PURPOSES IS JUST. PART OF THE CREATION. AND AND YOU COULD PROBABLY DO OTHER PROGRAMS BESIDES BRACE SYMBOL. WE DO OTHER MITIGATION PROGRAMS -- AS SECTION ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT NINE POINT THREE SEVEN IS THE PROVISION OF THE LAW THAT ESTABLISHES THIS EARTHQUAKE LOSS MITIGATION FUND. DIRECTS AT 5% OF OUR INVESTMENT INCOME UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICHEVER IS LESS GO INTO THAT FUND. AND THEN -- THE INDICATES THAT. ARE THAT OF THOSE FUNDS WE ARE TO PROMOTE MITIGATION. AND AS A PART OF OUR IRIS TAXES AND RULING. THE PART OF WHAT. ALLOW THE IRIS TO VIEW US AS A PUBLIC. NOT PROFIT AN ENTERPRISE THEREFORE WORTHY OF A NOT OF A TAX EXEMPT STATUS. WAS -- THE INDICATION THAT THESE FUNDS WOULD BE MAILED MADE AVAILABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS -- NOT LIMITED TO THOSE WHO HAVE A CA POLICY SO. IT'S A COMBINATION OF STATUTORY LAW IRIS. THE RULING AND EXPRESSED -- SEE INTENT THAT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE TODAY. FUNDS AVAILABLE TO MITIGATE CALIFORNIANS ALL CALIFORNIA'S NOT JUST THOSE WHO HAVE A EARTHQUAKE POLICY. OPENS FROM RIGHT NOT. TO I GUESS THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHY WHY THE LEGISLATION WHITE YOU YOU ALREADY GOT AN ANTENNA PURPOSE. WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THIS BILL WHAT -- THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT IS THIS BILL SO AT AN ENEMY WISHES BEFORE HIM. BUT WE VIEW THIS AS ALTURAS I GRAB PICKING ON YOU BUT I'M HAPPY TO KNOW OKAY -- JUST MORE TO HAVE MORE. OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM. IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS LIMITED PRIOR TO THIS LEGISLATION SO I THINK AS YOU KNOW WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA STATE THIS EARTHQUAKE PRONE. SO WE HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS ISTO MAKE SURE IT'S AVAILABLE TO MORE FOLKS AND JUST UNLIMITED. A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS -- OUT OF THE 5% YOU WANT TO USE SOME OF THAT. FOR PROMOTION AND COMMUNICATION OF THE PROGRAM IS THAT WITH THE THE M. -- IF I COULD COMPRESS SO EVERY LITTLE BIT. SO THE EARTHQUAKE BREATHABLE PROGRAM -- PART OF THE FUNDING CUTS TO THE PROGRAM COMES FROM THE THIS IS THE DOLLARS THAT ARE DIRECTED FROM THE THE FOR THE STATUTE THE 5% OF INVESTMENT INCOME -- ON TWO OCCASIONS THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED THREE MILLION DOLLARS EACH TIME FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO GO INTO THIS PROGRAM. AND OCCASIONALLY FEMA HAS AWARDED GRANTS -- THEY ALSO GO IN THIS PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM IS JOINTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE CA AND THE CALLAWAY US THROUGH IT -- GPA. AND AND IS SO YOU LOOK AT THAT IT AND WHATEVER FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE AS THE FOR IN THE IS THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THESE GRANTS. THE FUNNY SEVERELY LIMITED THESE GRANTS COSTS -- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR THOUSAND AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS REGARDED DEPENDING ON WHERE THE HOME IS LOCATED. THE WAY WE SET UP THE PROGRAM -- BECAUSE OF LIMITED FUNDS -- WE ESTABLISH SOME PRIORITIES -- ZIP CODES ARE RANKED ONE THROUGH HOWEVER MANY ZIP CODES ARE BASED ON TWO FIVE TWO CATEGORIES. ONE HIGH CONCENTRATION OF US SEISMIC RISK. AND TO THE HIGH CONCENTRATION OF OLD BUILDING STOCKS. IN WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROGRAM BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN I THINK IT WAS -- WE STARTED WITH WITH THE TOP FOUR ZIP CODES IT WAS THOSE TWO CATEGORIES ARE SMASHED TOGETHER. AND WE'RE WE'RE GROWING. TO EVER INCLUDE EVER MORE ZIP CODES ARE GETTING MORE INTO THE TO THE WEEDS AND I ARE WELL OKAY SORRY -- WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT WE WE AT LEAST 10% OF THE FUNDS AVAILABLE EACH YEAR. YES -- IN ANY YOU BEEN SAYING 5% BUT THE BUT THE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE ARE TO TO PROVIDE. EDUCATION -- ARE HELPING OUT OKAY OKAY OKAY 5% IS THE STATE'S REMANDED FIVE CENTER INVESTMENT INCOME NOW BUT FOR ME AND THOSE YEAR GETS DEPOSIT IN THE LOSS MITIGATION FUND. THE CASE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROPRIATED ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT TO GO INTO FUNDING IS PROGRAMS. THIS LIST OF LEGISLATION WOULD SAY WHEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES. FUNDS THE TICKET TO THESE PROGRAMS THAT TWO THINGS HAPPEN ONE WE ENGAGE IN SPECIFIC OUR REACH EFFORTS TO LOW INCOME. COMMUNITIES WHICH WE COMPLETELY SUPPORT AND EVERYBODY WOULD WEEP UPON THE THE THE THE DIRECTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PROVIDE IN THAT REGARD. AND 290%. I'M SORRY. 10% OF THE GRANTS WE WOULD ALLOW ALLOCATE THROUGH THOSE STATE APPROPRIATE FUNDS. WOULD BE TARGETED IT WOULD BE THERE'D BEEN ATTEMPTED TARGET OF HOUSEHOLDS OF LOW INCOME. AND THREE THAT THOSE GRANTS -- CONSTITUTE 90% OF THE OF THE AVERAGE IF IT COSTS. YOU. TO WRITE A LITTLE MORE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. TO TO THE RECIPIENT WE GOT THE PROGRAM 10% GOES TO COMMUNICATION AND PROMOTION 90% GOES TO THE ACTUAL [inaudible] GRAY NO. WERE INCREASED PROMOTE. BUT GRANT SAID AWARDED THROUGH THE STATE ALLOCATED MONEY-- THE GRANT WOULD COVER 90% OF THE COST OF THE RETROFIT IN A HOMEOWNER WOULD KICK IN THE REMAINING 10%. OKAY SO WE'RE NOT. AGAIN I GUESS WE'RE NOT. FINDING ANY NEW MONEY OTHER THAN WHAT OCCURS CORRECT AND EXPANDED. AND SO AGAIN I GUESS MAYBE JUST SUMMARIZE THIS BILL. IN YOUR OWN WORDS JUST IN FIFTY WORDS LEADS OR IT MIGHT ONE OF MY APPROVING I TAKE THIS AS LEGISLATIVE ENCOURAGEMENT. THAT WE DO MORE TO FOCUS -- EFFORT ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO MAKE AT LEAST A PORTION OF OUR GRANTS -- IMPACTFUL -- TO THE PEOPLE CAN LET LESLIE SUPPORT [inaudible] THAT'S THAT'S A PRETTY MUCH EXPAND IT TO THE LOW INCOME FOLKS HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE 9% OF THE COVERAGE OF THE COST.

NEXT UP WE'RE GONNA HAVE AB SEVEN FORTY BY BURKE. SEMI BURKE YOU MAY APPROACH THANK YOU. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS -- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOURSELF FOR TAKING SO MUCH TIME TO SIT AND TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL IS AND WHERE IT'S GOING SO I APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU'VE SPENT. WITH US -- FOR THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE I MADE THE DECISION INTRODUCED AB SEVEN FORTY WHILE ON A BUS RETURNING FROM PARADISE CALIFORNIA. WHERE I SAW FIRSTHAND THE DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY THE CAMPFIRE? I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN WORKING WITH MY CO AUTHORS ON WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION. I THANK CREATED SOLELY FOR VICTIMS NOT UTILITIES. AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT WILDFIRES THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FAMILIES HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES AND MOST ARE STILL WAITING TO REGAIN A SENSE OF NORMALCY. OVER A HUNDRED AND FOUR TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND INSURANCE CLAIMS TONY TOTALING TWENTY FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION WERE FILED IN RESPONSE TO CALIFORNIA'S TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES. OUR SPONSOR ABILITIES AS A STATE TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE DESTABILIZING EFFECTS OF THESE WILDFIRES ON ALL PARTIES CONTINUES TO GROW ESPECIALLY AS WE HEAD INTO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WILDFIRE SEASON. EXACERBATING THESE HARSH OF IS THE FACT THAT CATASTROPHIC RELATED WILDFIRE LAWSUITS CAN LAST BETWEEN SEVEN TO NINE YEARS. AND THE CONSTRUCTION DEMAND AND PRICE SURGES ARE RENDERING HOMEOWNERS UNDER INSURED BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN AFTER ENTIRE TO COMMUNITIES ARE DESTROYED. THROUGHOUT VERY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER LEGISLATORS IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT IN ADDITION TO THE BURDENS. SUFFERED BY WILDFIRE VICTIMS CALIFORNIANS ARE ALSO SUFFERING TO DEAL WITH INSURANCE ISSUES. I HAVE HEARD FROM SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT UNDER INSURANCE AND NON RENEWAL OF AFFECTING THEIR CONSTITUENTS. WE ARE WORKING WITH MULTIPLE ENEMIES INCLUDING FAIR PLAN TO SEE HOW WE CAN INCREASE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE TO ALL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING. IN HIGH RISK WILDFIRE AREAS. IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS COVERED BY FAIR PLAN POLICIES IN THE WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE HAS GROWN BY 35%. AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE LAST TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN SOME HIGH RISK COUNTIES THEY'RE THEY'RE RUNNING 3100% AHEAD OF THE PREVIOUS YEARS. AS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS I WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS TO EXPLORE HOW WE ADDRESS THESE INSURANCE CHALLENGES. A TRUE SOLUTION MUST BE ONE THAT ENCOURAGES ACCESS TO REASONABLY PRICED INSURANCE IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. CENTERS A. B. SEVEN FORTY ESTABLISHES A CALIFORNIA CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE VICTIMS FUND AND A COMMISSION TO OVERSEE IT. IT'S FUNDED BY A GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION AN EXTENSION OF EXISTING D. W. R. BOND REPAIR ASSESSMENTS VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS BY UTILITIES AND ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO THE FUND BY UTILITIES IF THEY ARE FOUND TO HAVE CAUSED A WILDFIRE. THE FIRST DATE CONTRIBUTION WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE VICTIMS OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES. ADDITIONALLY AB SEVEN FORTY INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT A LEXICAL CONTRA CORPORATIONS MUST RETAIN A COLLECTIVE SIX POINT FIVE BILLION IN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. AND INCREASE THEIR DEDUCTIBLE FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THIS FUND WILL BE ACCESSED BY VICTIMS ONLY. I WILL PROTECT UTILITY RATE PAYERS FROM INCURRING ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASES AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED WILDFIRES. IT WILL ENSURE THAT VICTIMS OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES INCLUDING HOMEOWNERS WHO FIND THEMSELVES UNDER INSURANCE DO THE CONSTRUCTION DEMAND SURGE CONCERNS COMPANIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE COMPENSATED IN A TIMELY MANNER. VICTIMS OF THE STATE NEED TO MAY BE MADE WHOLE AND IT SHOULD BE NOT DONE AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. ALL WHILE HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE AND NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF REPAIRS. I KNOW THEY'RE STILL MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE HAD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AS WE CONTINUE THIS WORK. THE GOAL FIRST AND FOREMOST OF ANY WILDFIRE FUND SHOULD SHOULD BE TO PROTECT ALL CURRENT AND FIX FUTURE VICTIMS. STABLING UTILITIES SHOULD BE A BY PRODUCT OF WHATEVER WE DO NOT THE FOCUS. I BELIEVE IF WE CONSIDER ALL OPTIONS THROUGH THAT LENS WILL ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN ALL STAND BEHIND. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ACOSTA NIGHT OF THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE THAT WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THE NO INTEREST ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. MR MORE LUCK THE MOTHER MISTER ARCHULETA. SOON BURKE I'M REALLY -- REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU I I I SIDE JUST A FEW QUESTIONS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT YOUR BILL AND NOW WE'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT FRIDAY AND WE GOT EVERYBODY. GOT THE COURT CAME OUT WITH SOMETHING YESTERDAY AND SO MAYBE JUST TO HAVE SOME DISCUSSION. I SERVED ON THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I DIDN'T SEE ONE DOLLAR. OR OR OR ONE DOLLAR DAHLE TO SET UP A FUND OR VICTIMS FOUNDER OR OR EVEN ALLOCATE OR DEDICATE WHO'S WHO IT'S GOING TO BE -- SO YOURS YOU'RE REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. RIGHT FROM THE BUDGET. ODD WHICH WHICH IS A BOLD MOVE SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT AND WHY DON'T WE SEE IT IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY WE DON'T SEE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BECAUSE I THINK -- I I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY WE DON'T SEE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT I CAN TELL YOU IS IT YES IT IS A BOLD MOVE BUT WE DO HAVE CURRENT WILD FIRE VICTIMS AND THE STATE DOES HOLD SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. AND I EIGHT BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING SHOULD BE THAT WE SHOULD TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK THE 200-017-2000 EIGHTEEN WHILE FIRE VICTIMS DESERVE THAT -- AND SO FOR ME THAT WAS A AN ALLOCATION THAT I BELIEVED WAS. A SHO OF OUR SOME OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE STATE WANTS TO USE MORE ELECTRICITY YOU KNOW WE WANT TO CHARGE CARS AND TRUCKS AND AND SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HELP UTILITIES TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD MOVE IN KIND OF KIND OF ART. THANKS FOR BROACHING THANK YOU -- THE SECOND WAS A SURCHARGE ON RATE PAYERS. THAT CONCLUDES. IN TWENTY TWENTY SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN. SO MY VIEW WAS -- I DIDN'T WANTED AND TO INCREASE -- OBVIOUSLY A VERY SENSITIVE I COME FROM A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY AND SO OBVIOUSLY MY INTENTION WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T SEE AN INCREASE AND REPAIR -- BILLS HOWEVER WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AND TALKING TO THE COMMERCIAL REPAIRS AS WELL BECAUSE D. W. R. FEES WERE WERE CREATED AS A RESULT OF THE ENERGY CRISIS AND SO -- WE'RE NOT WE DON'T ACTUALLY OUR GROUP OF CO AUTHORS BELIEVES THAT -- THAT THEY DON'T HOLD THE SAME WAY BUT YET THEY STILL DO USE -- LIKE TRICITY AND SO AS WE LOOK AT USING D. W. R. FUNDS AS WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH THE LENS AND WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION OF WHAT PROPORTION OF THAT WE WOULD REDUCE FOR COMING COMMERCIAL RATE PAYERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT. LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY HERE WE ALL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEY HAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITY THAN THEY DID IN THE ORIGINAL D. W. R. FEES. IN THE LAST TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS -- VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS -- IS THAT REALISTIC AND THEN -- TO CAN YOU COMMENT ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT. AND HOW COULD THIS BILL HELPS. THOSE EFFORTS -- SO I WOULD SAY THE THE VOLUNTARY YES I DO THINK IT'S POSSIBLE I THINK WITH THE COMPLETE PACKAGE I THINK THAT THE I'LL USE AND THE PO USE WILL SEE THE BENEFIT OF PARTICIPATING IN A FUND AND SO -- I THINK THAT THE GOAL IS TO USE A CARROT AND A STICK AT FIRST OF THAT SO WILL WE WE CAN DO IT. A AND SO AS OF AT THIS TIME I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A LOT OF PUSH BACK ON THE CONTRIBUTION. FROM THE I'LL USE OR THE PO USE -- HOW DOES THIS HELP WITH THE -- WITH THE BANKRUPTCY. I DON'T HAVE AN ACTUAL ANSWER FOR THAT I DO KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE PUT IN WHO HAVE FILED WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT SUPPORT OF FUND -- AND ARE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE ON THE BEHALF OF P. JEANNIE FOR THAT PLAN -- AND SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND IT SHOWS THAT A FUND IS NEEDED AND THAT THOSE WHO ARE -- TO PARTICIPATE IN P. JEANNIE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THEY DO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THAT FUND LOOKS LIKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VENTURE THANK YOU MISTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR BRITTANY'S BUILDINGS EXCELLENT EXCITED THAT IT'S HERE AND WE'RE FINALLY DOING SOMETHING. FOR SO MANY HOMEOWNERS IN AND THE STATE A CALIFORNIA. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IMAGINE THE MECHANISM WILL WILL REIMBURSE -- THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE HOMEOWNERS AND AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. AND YOU MENTION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT WHAT POINT. IS IT CLASSIFIED FOR REIMBURSEMENT. SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVEN'T DEFINED WHAT CATASTROPHIC MEANS AND THE BILL YET -- AND WE'VE DONE THAT ON PURPOSE BECAUSE AS THE BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE AND CHANGE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WILL MOVING CHANGE WE DO ASK THAT THE INSURANCE THAT THE UTILITIES DO TAKE UP MORE INSURANCE. AND THAT THEY ARE -- MORE CORING MORE THAN THAN TRADITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF DEDUCTIBLE WE RAISE THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE RAISE THE INSURANCE TO WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN THE MARKET AND TO BUY IT ON DESPITE SIZE OF THE SIZE OF THE MARKET OF EACH UTILITY. WHAT QUALIFIES FOR CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE WILL BE ADJUSTED FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS 10% OF THE FOR WILDFIRE IS DIFFERENT THAN SOMEONE LIKE A P. JEANNIE WHO HAS A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET AND SO WE'RE STILL WORKING? TO DEFEAT USE I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE DEFINE WHAT CATASTROPHIC IS THAT IT IS. SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE ENTIRE STATE -- IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO SLAP I DON'T BELIEVE WILL BE ABLE TO SLAP A ONE NUMBER ON A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR THE ENTIRE STATE I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE. IT COULD BE THE SIZE OF THE FIRE THE THE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS IN THE AND THE THE LOSS AND THE MARKET SHARE OF THAT UTILITY. THERE YOU GO OKAY THANK YOU START. THANK YOU IN. AND THANK YOU AS SOMEONE THAT I I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS SITE JOIN IN THAT TOUR PARADISE I THINK WE ALSO OFFER CELLS WHAT A HORRIBLE. SITUATION IT IS IN THE FACT THAT THIS BILL COMES OUT OF YOUR CONCERN AND COMPASSION FOR THE VICTIMS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND AT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE RAISED HERE AND I I KNOW THAT THIS IS. A YOU THE KNOWLEDGE A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I KNOW WITH THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY WANT TO BE IN THIS -- IT SOMEWHERE IN THIS SPACE AND SO I DO HAVE QUESTIONS AND THEIR SUBSTANTIAL QUESTIONS BUT I AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT TO MOVE THE BILL FORD I GUESS IT JUST. GIVES ME SOME PAUSE THAT WE SHOULD. TAKE THE TIME FOR SOME OF THESE THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER TODAY BUT CERTAINLY THE I'VE. THE WHOLE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION LIMIT FROM UTILITIES AND NOBODY'S COME HERE TO TESTIFY FOR THE UTILITIES. SO IF THEY'RE HAPPY ARE NOT HAPPY THEY'RE NOT REALLY SAYING ANYTHING WELL WE KNOW THE LET'S SAY A LOT WHEN THEY'RE NOT HAPPY DON'T THEY THAT IS TRUE. BUT MAYBE -- YOU KNOW THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHY YOU'RE LIMITING YOU KNOW THE THE DAMAGES THAT HAVE BEEN COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN WHAT I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO RAISE IN THIS BILL. YOU'RE ONLY ASKING UTILITIES TO COME UP WITH A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TOTAL IS THAT RIGHT RIGHT BUT IT'SNOT BECAUSE THAT'S THE TOTAL AMOUNT WE BELIEVE THE FUND WILL NEED -- WE ALSO CAN BOND ON THE FINDING WITH BETWEEN D. W. R. FEES AND THE UTILITIES CONTRIBUTION WITH BONDS AND INSURANCE WE BELIEVE WE CAN GET THAT THAT THE FUND WOULD REACH ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR MARK. BUT PART OF WHAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE FISCAL CONNECTICUT OKAY SO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT PART OF WHAT YOU'RE. TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AN A PORTION THAT ARE WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT A PORTION AND AND AND WHETHER OR NOT -- THOSE WHO ARE REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROBLEM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE STEPPING UP RIGHT ABSOLUTELY AND SO -- OBVIOUSLY THE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION FROM THE STATE IS A VERY GENEROUS THING -- BUT IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER WE WE SHOULD BE PAYING VERSES THE UTILITY SHOULD BE PAYING WHO HAVE BEEN FOUND AT FAULT RIGHT AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WORKING ON THIS BILL WE ACTUALLY WERE HOPING TO COVER BOTH -- UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES AND NON UTILITY BECAUSE WHILE BUYERS AND WE FELT THAT WE WERE ORIGINALLY DOING THE ONGOING CONTRIBUTION FOR THOSE THAT WERE NOT UTILITY BECAUSE WHILE BUYERS AS WE'VE HAD THE CONVERSATION WE'RE STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT IT MAY BE. MORE REALISTIC TO ONLY DO IT UTILITY BECAUSE WILD FIRES AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT THAT ONGOING IF WE CONTINUE THAT ON GOING. THIS BILL HAS BEEN WRITTEN -- FOR FOR NINE UTILITY COSTS WHILE THEY'RE BOTH ORIGINALLY WE WROTE THE BILL FOR BOTH SO IT WAS FOR UTILITY AND NON UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRE AND THE PORTION FOR CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA WAS CAN CUT. CONTRIBUTING WAS BECAUSE NOT ALL ONLY 10% OF WILDFIRES OF THESE LARGE WHY FIVE CAST OF WILDFLOWERS ARE CAUSED BY UTILITIES. AND SO IF IT WERE GOING TO BE. FOR NINE UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES OBVIOUSLY WE CAN ASK UTILITIES TO PAY THE BURDEN FOR NON UTILITY BECAUSE WILD FIRES AND SO. THAT'S WHEN WE ORIGINALLY HAD DISCUSSED THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ON GOING I THINK SINCE THEN WE HAVE STARTED HOW THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WE WILL MAKE AND THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING AN ADJUSTMENT TO THAT BECAUSE I DO AGREE THAT THAT IS A LARGE. ON GOING CONTRIBUTION. RIGHT BUT AS I UNDERSTAND YOUR BILL THIS IS A SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WILD FIRE VICTIMS BUILT RIGHT NOW THIS IS A CURRENT AN ON GOING WILD FIRE VICTIMS FUND. THIS IS NOT MEANT TO PAVE ACTIVITY AT JUST THE FIRST AND TING SO JUST THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WILL GO TO SUBSIDIZE THE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN VICTIMS IT IS AN ONGOING VICTIMS WILDFIRE FIND. RIGHT OKAY WHICH IS WHY WE USE D. W. R. FEES THAT'S AN ON GOING ON GOING CONTRIBUTION IS THAT D. W. OUR FEES ARE ONGOING CONTRIBUTIONS. AND THE MONEY FROM THE UTILITIES IS FOR TO BUILD A FIND THAT WE WOULD THEN BOND OR AND AND SURE ON OR AT LEAST AS IT RELATES. TO THIS BILL AT SOME LEVEL IS HIS TRYING TO COMPENSATE. RIGHTLY SO FOR THE VICTIMS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY RIGHT. A PORTION OR SHOULD HAVE IT BUT YOUR YOUR AND YOUR IDENTIFYING THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE STATE FOR THAT PURPOSE. IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT UTILITIES VOLUNTARILY PUT IN IS IS THAT FOR THAT PURPOSE ARE NOW THAT IS FOR THE ON GOING NO BECAUSE THAT IS NOT ALL OF THE UTILITIES RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT. THOSE THOSE THOSE FIRES HOW WILL FIND A CAUSE AND SOME HAVE FOUND A BECAUSE ALREADY IN SUMMER P. JEANNIE BECAUSE IN OTHER FIRES WE HAVE FOUND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN UTILITY BECAUSE OF THAT. UTILITY TO LADY CONTRIBUTION IS FOR ONGOING FIRES SO THAT WE BILL DEFINED ONE LARGE FIND THAT IS HAS THE CAPACITY TO FIND ON AND HAVE A CONSISTENT INCOME AND THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO REACH THAT TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. MARKET WITHOUT CONTINUING TO RAISE RATES ON REPAIRS SO YES THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. YES THAT PART WE HAVE ALLOCATED IN AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE VICTIM'S GROUPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT WAS A SUGGESTION FROM THEM THAT THEY FELT STRONGLY THAT THAT WOULD. THAT THEY WERE HAPPY TO SEE. SOME SORT OF ALLOCATION TO HELP THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE FACING BECAUSE OF CERTAIN THINGS LIKE P. JEANNIE AND AND BEING A BANKRUPTCY THAT THEY'RE FACING SOME CHALLENGE THAT TRADITIONALLY OF VICTIMS GROUP WOULD NOT FACE. AMEND THAT PHILIP FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO HELP OFFSET A PORTION OF THEM. OKAY THAT THAT'S CLEAR TO ME OKAY ON A PHILOSOPHICAL LEVEL I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO GOING FORWARD. WITH A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE RELIEF FUND WITH VARIOUS COMPONENTS. BUT GOING BACKWARDS OBVIOUSLY IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO AND I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IT. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAN IF THE UTILITIES ARE AT FAULT. FOR THOSE FIRES AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DOES THE GENERAL FUND GET PAID BACK FOR THAT MONEY -- I CAN SEE A POTENTIAL OF IN GENERAL FINE BEING PAID BACK FOR ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT GONE INTO THE DEEP DISCUSSIONS ON THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION I THINK THAT WAS FROM A RECENT STAKEHOLDER MEETING THAT WE HAD WHERE. WE HAD WE HAD WITH THE REPAIRS THAT WE HAD DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD ON MOVING THAT. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO OKAY WELL AT LEAST THE ONE PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE WE WOULD HELP THAT -- THE STATE WOULD BE A YOU KNOW THAT WOULD THAT AND THE VERY IDEA STATE OBLIGATION. AT FOR THE USE THAT THE UTILITY ILLEGALITY BECAUSE WILDFIRE ARSON AND I CAN APPRECIATE THAT AND I I TAKE THAT NO SERIOUSLY OKAY -- AND AND SO THIS THIS PROPSAL WOULD BE GOOD IF. THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WHAT THE RATE PAYERS PAY I GET IT IS ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH A THIRTY DOLLARS A YEAR RIGHT. THAT'S THE COST OF THIS BILL WOULD -- ADVANCE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TEN OR TWENTY YEARS TO BUILD THIS WILDLIFE WILDFIRE A PORTION OF THE FINE. GUY BUT THAT'S WHAT THE IT PEOPLE SAID HOW MUCH DOES THIS COST PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT AND YOUR DISTRICT IT'S IT'S THE SAME APPROXIMATELY AND LESSER LOW INCOME UNLESS YOU'RE A LOW INCOME -- PARTICIPATE IN IT. OF ANY OF THE UTILITIES OKAY AND AND THEN TO THE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ASK US ALL THE TIME -- ARE WE REALLY HOLDING. P. JEANNIE TO ACCOUNT. FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY CAUSED AND THE OBLIGATIONS THEY HAVE GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WHAT WOULD YOU SAYTO THEM I WOULD SAY A 100% I WOULD SAY THAT. WELL LIKE I SAID WHEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND THE LARGEST FUND PORTION OF THE FUND WILL COME FROM A P. JEANNIE WOULD COME FROM P. GINNY BECAUSE THEY CARRY THE LARGEST MARKET SHARE -- I AM ALL TOO AWARE -- LIKE I SAID AFTER BEING TO PARADISE AND TO BEING SOME OF THESE OTHER FIRES THAT YOU THAT P. JEANNIE HOLD RESPONSIBILITY AND ANY UTILITY. THAT IS RESPONSIBLE SHOULD HOLD THE RESPONSIBILITY HOWEVER WE HAVE CREATED A SYSTEM IN WHICH VICTIMS ARE HOLDING THE RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT NOW AND I DO NOT THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO US. WE CREATED THE SYSTEM NOT THE VICTIMS AND ME MAY NOT HAVE ALL BEEN HERE WHEN THE SYSTEM WAS CREATED BUT WE'RE HERE NOW AND THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND VICTIMS ARE SUFFERING FROM IT. AND WHILE P. JEANNIE ITSELF FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY AND ALL THEIR PROTECTING THEMSELVES WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE VICTIMS AND SO WE CAN HAVE THAT ARGUMENT AND ABSOLUTELY P. JEANNIE AT THE END OF THE DAY ANY I OWE YOU. THAT IS AT FAULT FOR A WHILE FIRE THAT BURNS DOWN VICTIMS HOMES OR BURNS DOWN A COMMUNITY SHOULD BE A 100% HELD RESPONSIBLE AND THIS THIS FUND DOES NOT CHANGE THAT. BUT WHAT THIS ONE DOES IS PUTS VICTIMS FIRST AND AS AS WERE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OUR OBLIGATION NOT TO REQUIRE THAT. COMMUNITIES WAIT SEVEN TO NINE YEARS TO SEE THAT KIND OF RECOVERY BUT THAT THING GET THEIR HOMES REBUILT NOW. THAT WHEN ENTIRE COMMUNITIES ARE BURNT DOWN AND BECAUSE OF NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THERE IS A PRICE SURGE AND THEY CAN NOT REBUILD THEIR HOMES THAT WE HAVE CREATED SOME SORT OF SAFETY NET FOR THEM. THIS IS OUR RESPOND THERE ARE PORTIONS OF THIS THAT ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY YES THERE ARE I OWE YOU RESPONSIBILITIES ABSOLUTELY AND MAYBE ONE DAY APPEAL YOU RESPONSIBILITY. BUT WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR CONSTITUENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE TAKNG CARE OF FIRST AND FOREMOST AND THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL COMES FROM AND THAT'S THE ITENTION. SO THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IN JUST A FISH. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME. SO MOTIVATED TO KEEP YOUR BILL MOVING IS BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE DOING IT IT OF WITH THE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. AND WHILE I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED IN YOUR BILL. THAT REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN TALKED OUT OR THOUGHT OUT COMPLETELY -- THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL POINT OF VIEW. TO INDICATE HOW MUCH WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE VICTIMS THIS IS THE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE IS INSURANCE AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ADEQUATE INSURANCE AND WE'VE HAD HEARINGS ON THIS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND. THE PROBLEMS OF FIVE THE UNDER INSURED NOT JUST THE NO INSURANCE BUT THE UNDERINSURED AND WE CERTAINLY SAW THAT WITH THESE WILD FIRES AT A LOT OF LEVELS -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE HEARD A NEW UPDATE ABOUT THE FAIR. PLAN AND WHETHER THAT'S REALLY BEING TAPPED TO DO IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY TO KNOW WHETHER THE HOMEOWNERS MARKETS CAVING OR NOT BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN HEARINGS ON THAT AND IT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF OUR JURISDICTION HERE. THAT WOULD BE MY HOPE THAT -- THROUGH THE CHAIRS LEADERSHIP THAT AS THIS STUFF GETS MORE FINALIZING CRYSTALLIZE THAT -- THAT YOU CAN SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE MIGHT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A MORE FURTHER EXAMINATION OF WHATEVER IS THE ADORATION OF THIS PROPOSAL FROM THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN OR OTHER OTHERS IS BECAUSE FOR AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND KILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS MISTER JOHNS. AND JUST TO THAT ROAD THROUGH THE CHAIR I JUST WELL YOU KNOW -- I THINK OUR OFFICE IN OUR STAFF OF ALWAYS BEEN VERY VERY GOOD ESPECIALLY WITH THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE AND AND WITH THIS CHAIR TO MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER WE WORK ON AND WHATEVER WE WORKED ON OVER THE YEARS AS A PASTOR COMMITTEES THAT WE STAY IN TOUCH WITH THE COMMITTEE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT EVERYTHING THAT COMES THROUGH IS STILL IS STILL IN LINE WITH THE GOALS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER JONES. I THINK I'M SURE IN AND ACTUALLY -- SENATOR ACTUALLY CONSIDER GLAZER KIND OF PICKED UP ON MY CONCERN WITH THE BILL SPECIFICALLY. THINK I'M GRASPING ALL THE CONCEPTS BEHIND IT BUT YOU DO HAVE SOME -- BLANK LINES IN THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AND WHICH WHICH WHILE I'VE SUPPORT INTENT IN THE AND THE HIGH LEVEL CONVERSATION -- THAT YOU AND MR GLAZER JUST HAD -- IN A LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL CAN USE YOU'VE GOT SOME. DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT ARE LEFT. UNFILLED -- WHICH IS NOT AS BIG A CONCERN FOR ME HIS SINCE IT SAYS THIS INTENT LANGUAGE BUT YOU DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS THAT. ARE LEFT -- UNDEFINED -- AS BLANK LINES IN ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF THE BILL -- WHICH GIVES ME SOME PAUSE. IF YOU WANT. EXPLAIN MATTER I MEAN I KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME LYING I I MEAN I HAD THE BEST EXPLANATION GIVEN THINK IS THE ONE THAT I'VE ALREADY GIVEN WHICH WERE IN PROCESS OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE -- CAREFUL AND PROPERLY ANALYZED THE DIFFERENCE OF MARKET SHARE AND SO THAT WE DON'T JUST PLUG IN NUMBERS BECAUSE THIS BODY HAS BEEN KNOWN TO PLUG JUST PLUG IN SOME NUMBERS -- WE WANT TO BE MUCH MORE -- THOUGHTFUL AND CAREFUL ABOUT THAT AND MUCH MORE ANALYTICAL AND DATA DRIVEN WHEN WE PLUG IN THOSE NUMBERS AND THAT THEY ARE BASED ON MARKET SHARE AND RISK AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND NOT JUST NUMBERS THAT WE JUST MADE UP BASED ON CONTRACTS OR NUMBERS IN THE DEFINITIONS WHEN DO. YOU THINK THAT YOU'LL HAVE THOSE FINALLY WE'RE WORKING ON THEM NOW SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WITH THE NEXT. TO COMMITTEES.

ALTHOUGH WE'VE DONE THAT I DON'T I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT'LL HAPPEN WITH THIS BILL I DON'T SEE US USING. GENERAL FUND OR STATE MONEY AND AND THE FINAL SOLUTION OUT I LEASE AYE AYE THAT THINK WE CAN FIND OTHER WAYS OTHER MECHANISMS THAT DON'T. PUT A TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK FOR THIS BUT I APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION. AND IF YOU ASK THE FOURTH AVENUE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. I THINK YOU FIGURED IT OUT.

NEXT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO AB EIGHT ONE AS OUR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN I MUST ALI YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU AGAIN AND ONCE AGAIN I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS HOUSE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS -- AS MENTIONED ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS THE INSOLVENCY OF MERCED CASUALTY FOLLOWING THE CAMPFIRE LAST YEAR ILLUMINATED THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT LAW GOVERNING CLAIMS FOR THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION. KNOWN AS SEGA. SEGA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING CLAIMS ONE OF PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURER BECOMES INSOLVENT. EXCEPT FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS EXISTING LAW CAPS SEE GOOD CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY CASUALTY AT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. OBVIOUSLY THE COST OF BUILDING HAVE RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY CENSUS CAP WAS ESTABLISHED. FIVE DECADES AGO. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TO REBUILD MANY HOMES IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY WITH THE INCREASED COST OF BUILDING. AFTER A MAJOR DISASTER. THE BILL INCREASES THE CAT FOR CLAIMS TO REPLACE TO REBUILD THE HOME TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT THE EXISTING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CAPS APPLY SEPARATELY TO THE OTHER COVERAGES COMMONLY FOUND IN A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. THESE OTHER COVERAGES COMMONLY INCLUDE CONTENTS ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES AND OTHER STRUCTURES. MISTER MICHAEL MARTINEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND THEY ARE A SPONSOR OF THE BILL. I JUST CALLED YOU MISTER DALI YOUR COLLEAGUE THAT CAME OVER FROM THE ASSEMBLY SO MY APOLOGIES AFTER. THINGS -- WELL I GET CALLED DOWN ASSEMBLY REVIEW ALL THE TIME TOO SO I BUT UP GO AHEAD SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION. GOOD AFTERNOON MARC MARTINEZ HER BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA HE IS PROBABLY AS SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE AND WANT TO THANK THE SOME WOMEN FOR IS -- LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS MEASURE AND ABSOLUTE GREW WITH WHAT THE SOMEONE MINUTES STATED I'VE EVER TO AND THE NEED FOR THIS MEASURE. BECAUSE REALLY MEAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A VERY OUTDATED NUMBER IT HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE INCEPTION OF SEGA. AND WE HAVE CONSIDERED IT INSUFFICIENT ANOTHER -- ITEM HERE IS THAT THE INCREASE OF THE OF SUGGEST CAP BEING RAISED TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS IS REFLECTED AS A RECOMMENDATION IN THE RECENT SB NINE A ONE COMMISSION. REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN THE LAST HANDFUL OF WEEKS AS A RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE THE COMMISSION FELT. THE EXISTING CAP WOULD RESULT IN A PAYMENT FROM SIR THERE WHICH IS FAR BELOW. THAT WHICH THE HOMEOWNER WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE RECEIVE FROM THEIR INSURER AND SO WITH THAT ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I ALSO HAVE HERE WITH ME LAWS LOW COMMUNITY. WHO IS A LAWYER AT THE DEPARTMENT TO ANSWER TO HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU? ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. A JOHN NOR WOULD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TERMS GERRITY ASSOCIATION JUST ONE INDICATOR WERE FINE WITH THIS CHANGE AND THERE WILL BE NO WAS NEW ASSESSMENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS.

ANYBODY WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY COME UP PLEASE. SEE NO INTEREST MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. CENTER MORE LOG. I'M I'M ASSUMING THERE'S NO COST TO TAXPAYERS IS THAT A CORRECT ASSUMPTION. I BELIEVE SO. NO THAT THERE SHOULD BE THE THE COSTA FOR FOR SYRIA IT ACTUALLY IS -- FOR THE THE THE THE CLAIMS OR TAKEN FROM INSURERS THAT RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT IS IN TURN WHERE THE COST BASED ON THEIR MARKET SHARE. THAT IS WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM WHICH ENTERED WHICH IN TURN IS PAID OUT TO COVER CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT COVERED -- IN ANY COURT BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS COULD BE A MODIFICATION TO THEIR PREMIUMS A NEW [inaudible] OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND AND A HALF WE CALCULATED. THAT THE MINIMUS. ALSO WHICH IS. AS A IT NOW STANDS. CATION HAVING AND BEING VERY. THERE IS SUFFICIENT FUNDS THAT SEEK A CURRENTLY. TO ANALYZE THAT PLANS AND ONCE THE POLICIES ARE TAKING CARE OF AND THE LIQUIDATION OF LIKE THAT CONTINUES. ANY FUNDS THAT MERCED HAS TO GO TOWARD IT FIRST THING IN MINISTRY AND SAYS. AND THEN REIMBURSING YOU GET TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY THAT THE HOUSE FUNDING BY. THERE IS NO ANTICIPATION OF THIS TIME. AND IF ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE FUTURE IF YOU'RE SOME SHRINK RECKON WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME MONEY WE JUST -- RELY ON THE PERSONAL ASSETS OF RICARDO LARA THAN [inaudible] AT I DON'T KNOW IF.

THIS TROUBLES AT THIS TIME WE WILL HOLD THE ROPE IN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH GENTLEMEN MAX. THANK YOU -- I SEE MISTER ARAMBULA HIM FACE. COME UP WE'RE MOVING OVER. TO AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM HERE TO PRINT TODAY TO PRESENT ON A. B. TWELVE TWENTY THREE REGARDING. LIVING ORGAN DONATIONS. NEARLY SIXTY NINE HUNDRED LIVING ORGAN DONATIONS ARE DONE EACH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO OF THOSE WERE DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR MANY PATIENTS IN ORGAN FAILURE AN ORGAN TRANSPLANT. CAN BE THEIR ONLY REMAINING MEDICAL OPTION UNDER CURRENT LAW LIVING ORGAN DONORS ARE ALLOWED UP TO THIRTY DAYS OF PAID LEAVE AFTER WHICH AFTER SURGERY TO FULLY RECOVER. JOHNS HOPKINS MEDICINE REPORTS THAT FULL RECOVERY FROM ORGAN DONATION TAKES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR TO SIX WEEKS WITH SOME PATIENTS NEEDING EVEN MORE TIME. LIVING DONORS ALSO EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION WITH SOME INSURERS AND DO NOT HAVE EXPLICIT JOB PROTECTION. WHILE THEY RECOVER FROM ORGAN DONATION SURGERY. FOR EXAMPLE A STUDY FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH DEMONSTRATED THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF KIDNEY DONORS HAD DIFFICULTY CHANGING. OR INITIATING INSURANCE PLANS AND IT WAS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WITH LIFE INSURANCE. AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE SIX TO ADDRESS THESE HURDLES FOR ORGAN DONATION WITH A TWO PRONGED APPROACH. FIRST AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE WITHIN A LOT ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL ON PAID LEAVE UP TO THIRTY BUSINESS DAYS. IN A ONE YEAR PERIOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF ORGAN DONATION. THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT AN EMPLOYEE MUST FIRST EXHAUST ALL AVAILABLE SICK LEAVE BEFORE TAKING THAT ON PAID LEAVE. BY ADDING THIS. OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL ON PAID LEAVE IF NEEDED POTENTIAL ORGAN DONORS WILL HAVE COMFORT KNOWING THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE NECESSARY TIME. FOR A FULL RECOVERY WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOBS. SECOND AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT INSURERS FROM DECLINING READING OR LIMITING COVERAGE OF A PERSON UNDER A LIFE. OR DISABILITY INSURANCE POLICIES SOLELY DUE TO THE STATUS OF THE PERSON AS A LIVING ORGAN DONOR. THESE TWO APPROACHES AIMTO REDUCE THE HURDLES FOR ORGAN DONATION BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF SURGICAL RECOVERY TIME BY THIRTY DAYS. AND PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ORGAN DONORS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS SCOTT SADLER WITH THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRMAN RUBIO VICE JIM JONES MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON A. B.. TWELVE TWENTY THREE THIS BILL PROHIBITING TURNS DISCRIMINATION BASED ON A PERSON'S STATUS AS AN ORGAN DONOR. AND ONE SURE ACCESS TO JOB PROTECTED LEAVE FOR ORGAN DONORS. I'M SCOTT SAILOR I REPRESENT THE AMERICAN CAN YOU FIND A K. F. IS AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT. THAT FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS IS HELP PEOPLE FIGHT KIDNEY DISEASE AND LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES WE RUN THE NATION'S LARGEST FREE KIDNEY HEALTH SCREENING PROGRAM TO WORK EVERY DAY TO HELP PEOPLE PREVENT KIDNEY DISEASE AND DETECTED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. TRANSPORTATION AXES A LITERAL LIFELINE FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM KIDNEY FAILURE OFFERING A CHANCE FOR A LONGER HEALTHIER LIFE. BUT THE SEVERE SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE ORGANS THE UNITED STATES MEANS THAT MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ARE WAITING FOR A KIDNEY DONATION. WE BELIEVE THE AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE WILL REMOVE BARRIERS TO LIVING DOWN THE ORGAN DONATIONS. AND WE BELIEVE THIS GUARANTEEING JOB SECURITY WHEN THEY TAKE TIME OFF TO RECOVER AND PROHIBITING INSURERS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ORGAN DONORS. IS SENSIBLE PUBLIC POLICY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE APPRECIATE A AYE VOTE FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK AND SUPPORT PLEASE COME UP. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MCCUE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN SUPPORT ABOUT. THANK YOU.

TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE RUBIO HI RUBIO AYE JONES. JONES I ARCHULETA. ARCHULETA IBEATS. BATES AYE BURGESS BURGESS AYE DODD. DODD AYE GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE GLAZER. WHERE I RUBIO HUESO? HUESO AYE MITCHELL MORLOCK. MORE LIKE I PORTANTINO. PORTANTINO AYE ROTH ROTH AYE. TWELVE ZERO AT THIS TIME WILL LIVE THE BILL CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I SEE -- MISTER BERMAN HAS JOINED US. WE WILL BE HEARING AB TEN SIXTY FIVE I MUST BERMAN YOU MAY PROCEED THANKYOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR THE CONSIDERABLE TIME. AND AND EFFORT HIS DEVOTED THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGES FIVE AND SIX OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH ADDED MINISTRY OF REMEDIES AND ADDRESS DRAFTING INCONSISTENCIES. AB TEN SIXTY FIVE WOULD INDEFINITELY EXTEND THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO OFFER CONSUMERS THE OPTION OF RECEIVING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY. THE ADVANTAGES TO OPTIONAL ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ARE NUMEROUS INCLUDING ADDITIONAL CONSUMER CHOICE FASTER DELIVERY REDUCED COST ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF GOING GREEN. AND PORTABILITY. AS THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS NOTES IN THE AFTERMATH OF A DISASTER SUCH AS A FIRE FLOOD OR MUD SLIDE THE ABILITY FOR INSUREDS WHO HAVE SUFFERED LOSSES AND INSURERS. TO CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS ELECTRONICALLY CAN ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY PROCESS. BECAUSE WE MAY BE DEALING WITH IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CONSUMERS THE LAW IMPOSES ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS ON INSURERS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER. FOR EXAMPLE A CONSUMER MUST ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS TRANSMITTED ELECTRONICALLY SO THAT I MISSED EMAIL OR AN EMAIL THAT ENDS UP CAUGHT IN THE SPAM FILTER WILL NOT JEOPARDIZE INSURANCE COVERAGE. THIS HEIGHTENED STANDARD OF CONSUMER PROTECTION IS GREATER THAN THE LAW APPLICABLE FOR PAPER DOCUMENTATION. AS AMENDED A. B. TEN SIXTY FIVE PERTAINS EXISTING CNSUMER PROTECTIONS. AND PUTS IN PLACE COMPLIANCE ORIENTED REMEDIES WELL PERMANENTLY PRESERVING THE OPTION FOR CONSUMER TO CHOOSE ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF INSURANCE DOCUMENTATION. ACCORDINGLY I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. BY CONVERTING MISTER BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND REALLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS TO COMMITTEE. OF BOTH COMMITTEES IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE WORKING ON THIS LOSS SAID AMENDMENTS WHICH REALLY HELP TO PROVIDE THE COMMISSION TO BE. VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PROMISE OF WHAT TECHNOLOGY CAN BRING TO THE INSURANCE -- MARKET PLACE AND SO WHAT THIS IT WAS WITH THE AMENDMENTS OF PROVIDES THE COMMISSIONER WITH ADDITIONAL INTERMEDIATE ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES ON TOP OF THE EXISTING -- ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO ENSURE SORT OF THIS BALANCE AND HELP FOR INSURERS TO CURE. OF ANY PROBLEM WITHIN A SPECIFIED TIME FRAMES WAS NOT TERM CURE ADDITIONAL INTERMEDIATE PENALTIES ESPECIALLY IN AND TIMES WHEN IT'S INNER INADVERTENT. AND SWEET SO THIS IS REALLY GOOD -- RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND WITHOUT ASK HER AYE VOTE. GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRY MCCUE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN SUPPORT THE BILL WE TWO WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS ARE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. GOING FORWARD WE CERTAINLY HOPE WE WILL SEE MORE INSURANCE COMPANIES PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH THE OPTION TO BENEFIT FROM TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY.

CONSIDER IT LEAVE THE CALL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS ARE I MEAN IF THE CALL ON I'M SO SORRY -- MISTER COOLEY YOU MAY PROCEED. I ALMOST FORGOT YOU MY APOLOGIES -- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO AB FIFTEEN NINETY ONE MISTER COOLEY I KNOW. WE'LL CALL IN A PRESCRIPTION TO BE HERE IN THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE PRESIDENT AB. FIFTEEN NINETY ONE THE BACKSTORY THIS MEASURE REALLY THE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT. MANY OF THE KEY RULES AFFECTED INSURANCE COME OUT OF A PROCESS WHERE THERE'S A NATIONAL BODY. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS A PRIVATE BODY. THE PROVIDES A VENUE FOR THE REGULARS ALL FIFTY STATES TO DISCUSS. NATIONAL INSURANCE MARKETPLACE ISSUES. AND OUT OF THAT BODY THEY PROMULGATE DRAFT MODEL LOS MODEL REGULATIONS. YOUR CUSTOMER THINK OF YOURSELF YOU'RE THE LEGISLATOR YOU ACTUALLY PASSED THE LOS BUT THE ANY ICY. PROMULGATES MODEL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THEY HAVE AN ACCREDITATION PROGRAM THAT A INSURANCE DEPARTMENT CAN ONLY GET ACCREDITED. IF YOU HAVE ALL THESE LAWS IN PLACE THEY HAVE VARIOUS CRITERIA -- SO YOU HAVE IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. IT THE WHOLE SYSTEM REGULATIONS FOUNDED UPON A DELEGATION. OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO A PRIVATE PARTY THE ANY I SEE. WE HAVE IN OUR CODES MANY OF THESE STATUTES IN PLACE -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE PROVISIONS THAT. IN HERE MARKET CONDUCT TO SAY OUR LAW INCORPORATES THE WORK OF THE ANY I SEE THEIR MARKER CONDUCT MANUAL. IN THIS MOST RECENT ITERATION. WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS THEY COULD CHANGE THE RULES TOMORROW. YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT AND IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO OUR STATUTE THAT IS A CLASS OF DELEGATIONS FUTURE DELEGATES WHICH IS VERY UNUSUAL. IN OUR SYSTEM OF LAW. ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS GIVEN THIS BACKDROP. THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY RELIES UPON THIS DELEGATED AUTHORITY. THAT ON EVERY TWO YEAR CYCLE THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER SHOULD PROVIDE A BRIEFING TO THE STATE LEGISLATOR. THE RELEVANT BUDGET CRUISER OVERSEE INSURANCE ON THE POLICY COMMITTEES. ON WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THE ANY I SEE THE SYSTEM OF ACCREDITATION HOW IT'S WORKED ANY CHANGES SINCE THE LAST -- LAST BRIEFING -- SO THE BASICALLY THE LAWMAKERS WHO ARE DELEGATED THIS AUTHORITY WILL BE KEPT CURRENT ON WHAT IS THE CONVERSATION THAN A I SEE. IT ALSO ENCOURAGES THAT THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT SHOULD SUPPORT. THE CHAIRS LIKE WATER TO MEMBER CYNOSURE SCREENING EACH HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE REPRESENT. TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPTION TO GO BACK AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ICY. AND A COMPANION ORGANIZATION THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF INSURANCE LEGISLATORS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS NATIONAL COUNCIL INSURANCE LEGISLATORS ARE STRICTLY LAWMAKERS. THE CONVENE PERIODICALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HOT. ON INSURANCE FRONT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO KNOW ABOUT. ARE THE DIVERSITY GOING TO THOSE TO ME IS IF YOU GO TO THE ANY I SEE IT'S LIKE. YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT PLANTS ARE IN THE WORLD YOU JUST WALK OUT OF THE FOREST. IT'S VERY CONFUSING TO SPEND A FEW DAYS IT MAY I SEE ALL THE TOPICS UNDER CONSIDERATION TO GET UP TO SPEED WALKING OFF THE STREET AS OLD. AS A MEMBER THE PUBLIC IS VERY HARD IT'S KIND OF CHAOTIC. IN COIL IS MORE OF A FOCUS CITY WHERE YOU'D BE YOU'D BE SEEN WITH OTHER LAWMAKERS THERE'S AN AGENDA THEIR SPREE FEEDS. REALLY DESIGNED EIGHT EIGHT THE QUICK LAWMAKERS SO I VIEW THIS BILL IS ISN'T KNOWLEDGE MEN OF THIS DELEGATION ISSUE. THE IMPORTANCE OF LAWMAKERS BEING INFORMED ON PUBLIC POLICY THE C. GET MATTER THAT THE GUARANTEE FUND YOU JUST TALK ABOUT THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE ACCREDITED STANDARD STATUTES IN CALIFORNIA. A IT'S JUST DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT LAWMAKERS WHO ARE THE SOURCE OF THIS DELEGATED POWER ACTUALLY SORT OF HAVE A HANDLE ON WHAT'S ONE OF THE HOT ISSUES WHAT'S CURRENT. AND TRADITIONALLY AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT WILL CONTINUE CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY PAYS THE LEGISLATURE PAYS OUR MEMBERSHIP IN NATIONAL COUNCIL INSURANCE LEGISLATORS I WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT TO CHANGE. BUT IT DOES ASK THE DEPARTMENT SURE IS TO KIND OF COORDINATE WITH HELPING GET SOME LAWMAKERS OUR THEY ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON SO THAT'S THE BACK ROW THIS BILL I THINK IT IS FOR THE GOOD OF OUR OUR OUR WORKERS LAWMAKERS. THE CENTRALITY OF LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WE'VE HAD AN INSURANCE CODE PROVISION. TWELVE NINE TWENTY ONE EIGHTY THIS IS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER JOBS WITH MINISTER ALL THESE STATUTES. FOR THEIR JOB IS TO FIND OUT WHAT IS ON THE BOOKS. THE LECTURE JUST PUT THERE THIS BILL JUST SUPPORTS THE REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. YES -- THORN CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY STEP FORWARD. THE NO INTEREST MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. NO -- BRIGHTEN THE MIDDLE JUST AND WITH NO POSITION THE INSURANCE ¯E INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. RICARDO LARA AND WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION HE DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT ON THIS MEASURE APPRECIATE ALL THE FEEDBACK AND DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF. AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE IS THIS -- ON ON JUST A COUPLE MORE TINY QUESTIONS ARE AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MARTINEZ -- MISTER GLAZER -- THANK YOU I I LIKE THE BILL I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- I THINK IT'S A BONUS THAT IT DOESN'T SAY THAT COMMISSIONER OR IS DESIGNATES AS THE COMMISSIONER. AND OUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE OUR DOES IT NEED A NICE TO HAVE OUR GOOD FRIEND BACK HERE IN FRONT OF US -- TO BE ANY OF OUR YEAR. TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS MR JOHNSON. THANK YOU JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS MOVING CAR FIVE ME IF I AND REMEMBER CORRECTLY CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE WITH AN ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS THAT CORRECT ALL I DON'T KNOW THE WERE THE ONLY. ONE BUT IT WAS AN APPOINTED POSITION UNTIL PROP ONE OF THREE PASSED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT REGARDING IS FOR TWO QUESTIONS -- REGARDING THE DELEGATED POWERS WHY DON'T WE JUST. ELIMINATE THAT ASPECT -- OF THAT AGREEMENT -- SO THAT ALL ALL. ISSUES HAVE TO COME BACK TO US NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DECIDES HE'S NOT GOING TO COMPLY WITH THIS WHAT'S THE ENFORCEMENT. PROCESS. THE RESPONSES ON THAT I THINK TO CHANGE THE DATE FOR THE INTEREST CHRIS OF POSITION WOULD YOU DO TO VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY PROP ON ALL THREE WERE STRUCTURED. YEAH I'M JUST I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR ELIMINATING ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER OF RIGHT I WAS JUST STATING THAT AS A YEAH THAT'S SO THAT'S THAT'S A GIVEN -- LET'S SEE NOW THE FIRST QUESTION THEN AFTER THAT YOU MENTIONED. YEAH I DELEGATED POWERS -- YEAH I THINK -- AS A PRACTICAL MATTER ANY AS HE DOES PER PROMULGATE THESE MODELS AND THEY OFTEN COME BEFORE US. I WILL SAY IN MY CAREER WHEN I'VE SERVED AS A CONSULTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE -- AND IN THE ASSEMBLY AND NINETEEN EIGHTIES FOR ITS ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE. IT WAS ALWAYS MY RECOMMENDATION IT WHAT IT WHAT THE AN ICY CAME FORWARD WITH WAS A MODEL LAW OR MODEL REGULATION. THE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE JUST TREAT THEM AS SOME TO WE WOULD ADOPT BY STATUTE. WE WOULD BE IN CONTROL OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS NOT THAT THINGS GET PROPOSES REGULATIONS GOING TO DOCTORS REGULATIONS WE'VE NEVER SEEN. SO I DO THINK AN ACTIVE INTEREST BY POLICY MAKERS IN THE INSURANCE COMMITTEES CAN CAN KIND OF CONTROL THIS THIS IS PART OF WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT. ON THIS OTHER ISSUE VIS A VIS DID NOT COMPLY I THINK THAT'S WHY WE PASSED A STATUTE THE THE OR SOURCE OF THIS BILL. NOT UNDER OUR CURRENT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER BUT IN TIMES PAST. I HAD REACHED OUT TO THE ANY I SEE. REQUESTED THEY MIGHT COME TO SACRAMENTO. AND PROVIDE A BRIEFING ON WHAT THEY WOULD DO WHAT THEY DO. BECAUSE RESIST DELEGATED POWER. AND IN THOSE DAYS THEY SAID WELL WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU. AND WHAT ENSUED WAS A REACHED OUT TO THE THE DENTURES TREASURER OF THE TIME. CALIFORNIA WHO SAYS NO I DON'T WANT TO COME TO CALIFORNIA AND THAT INITIATIVE ONE AWAY. SO THIS IS ACTUALLY A WAY TO KIND OF DO SOME STATUE TO SET US MAKE SURE. LAWMAKERS GET A BRIEFING GET A CUSTOM TO KIND OF KEEPING TABS ON ANY I SEE. AND IF THEY WISH TO GO A COUPLE TIMES YOU'RE IN COIL KIND OF LEARN WHAT'S HOT AND KERR DEBATES. AND I ACTUALLY I'M AN OFFICER NOW IN IN C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; LIKE SAY YOU GO&lt;/c&gt;</u> THERE. IN A COUPLE OF DAYS YOU'LL GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S COMING OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT MATTERS WHAT'S HAPPENED FEDERAL LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. IT IS A STATE BASED REGULATION BUT BECAUSE OF PRIVACY ISSUES OF FINANCIAL CRISES THE FEDS HAVE MORE OF A ROLE. IT'S A WAY TO KIND OF SPEND A LITTLE PLAY SPENT A COUPLE DAYS WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES OTHER STATES. AND COME AWAY MUCH MORE IN COMMAND OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS PANEL. I THINK I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT BUT HOW YOU GONNA FORCE HIM TO CALM OR HER CALM IF HE DOESN'T. WANT TO OUR SHE DOESN'T WANT TO OUR WELL I THINK THEN YOU YOU START PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE ANY I SEE AND SO YOU WATER. ARRANGE FOR THIS -- MAYBE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IN FUTURE YEARS IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS -- THAT MIGHT BE THE TOOL THAT WE THERE YOU GO BECAUSE THE STATUTE DOES CONCLAVE USEFUL EDUCATE OUR BUDGET. THANK YOU MISTER ROCK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MYCOLOGIST ABOUT THE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY WITH REGARD TO THE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY NO THE ANALYSIS OF WE'VE BEEN PROVIDED INDICATES. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE ALLOWS NON CONTROVERSIAL TECHNICAL AND PROCEDURAL CHANGES TO BECOME LAW WITHOUT DEBATE OR SCRUTINY. ASSUME THAT'S THE DELEGATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SIR YEAH THAT WOULD BE -- THAT IS CERTAINLY -- AN ASPECT OF IT I MEAN I WOULD SAY. THE MAN DOES IT EXTEND BEYOND THAT. WELL I'LL SAY THIS THE ANY MORE ANY OF THESE MODELS THERE EIGHTEEN MODEL STATUTES ARE GENERALLY A PRODUCT OF PROBABLY TWO OR THREE YEARS OF OF DEBATES AND DISCUSSIONS INSIDE THE ANY I SEE. AND SO WE NEVER KIND OF TYPICALLY ARE PARTICIPATING HAVE ARE HERE THE GROUND HERE IN ONE OF THE TRADE OFFS BEING MADE. THEY END UP WITH A DOCUMENT WHICH IS OUR MODEL STATUTE THEY BRING TO US AND ASK US INTRODUCED. THREE YOU KNOW WORDS DO MATTER AND THERE CAN BE SUBTLETIES OF WORDING THAT REPRESENTS SOME TRADE OFF THAT HAPPENED IN A I SEE. WHICH ACTUALLY MAYBE SOME SERVICE IMPACT WE MAY NOT SEE IT -- MUST BE UP THERE MUST BE A A PROTOCOL THAT WE'VE SIGNED. WELL I THINK WE I MEAN I WOULD SAY IN OUR INSURANCE CODE FOR EXAMPLE THE MARKER CONDUCT AREA WE JUST HAVE A PROVISIONS SAYS. THE MARKET CONDUCT GUIDE OF THE ANY I SEE AS A CURRENT EXIST OR FUTURE EDITIONS. OUR OUR THE ONE THAT OUR DEPARTMENT [inaudible] RUNS WITH. SO THAT'S THAT COULD BE MORE THAN JUST TECHNICAL CHANGES WELL I MEAN LET ME AS COULD TO THE DIFFERENT WAYS SO WITH REGARD TO THE IN A I SEE SO. THE IN A I SEE COULD ADOPT A MODEL CODE HAVING TO DO WITH UNINSURED UNDERINSURED. AND IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR WELL IT WE WOULD HAVE TO ADOPTED WE WE HAVE TO ACT UPON THEIR MODELS. BUT THEY COULD ADOPT A MODEL WHICH WE MIGHT CONSIDER CONTROVERSIAL. AND THEY CAN INCORPORATED IN THEIR ACCREDITATION SYSTEM. AND THEN WE SORT OF HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A WE WE NEED TO KIND OF BACK UP OUR INTEREST FORMER SAY WELL. THAT'S YOUR MODEL IS TWENTY YEAR. THINGS THAT YOU MEASURE WHETHER AN INSURANCE FARMERS ACCREDITED BUT WE ACTUALLY AS POLICY MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA OF A DIFFERENT VIEW SO APPARENTLY THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO IF IT IS. IF THE SUBJECT IS NON CONTROVERSIAL TECHNICAL OR PROCEDURAL IT CAN SIMPLY SLIDE RIGHT INTO OUR INSURANCE CODE WITHOUT COMING HERE. BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT IT HAS TO COME HERE AND WE HAVE TO DEBATE AND VOTE ON IT I WOULD SAY I MEAN I'M GONNA SAY. THIRTY ASKED YOU HAVE. THEY CAN'T PASS A MODEL. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY PASSED A MODEL IT'LL HAVE NO AFFECT US IN CALIFORNIA. THE ONLY WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN CALIFORNIA IS IF BECAUSE INTRODUCES A BILL. AND GOES TO OUR PROCESS. YOU KNOW THIS THE STANDARD IS REAR ENACT NO LOCKS UP BY A STATUTE NEW STATUTES UP BY BILL THAT STILL APPLIES. IF THEY GO THE REGULATORY ROUTE THEY FEEL THEY HAVE SOME AUTHORITY OR IN THE STATUTE. THEN MAYBE THERE ARE MODEL REGULATION GETS. PROMULGATED BY INSTRUCTORS AS A MODEL REGULATION STILL HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS -- I AM JUST A PROPONENT FOR LAWMAKERS TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS REPRESENTED THESE MODELS WHEN THEY COME FORWARD? AND MAYBE SOME OF THE BACKSTORY CONVERSATION. SO THAT WE HAVE A MORE INFORMED. VIEW OF WHAT WE ARE ADOPTING. WHAT IT IS? ALSO. IT'S AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON YEAH I MEAN I DO THINK THAT WE DO HAVE PROVISIONS ON THE CODE THAT SAY. THE MOST CURRENT EDITION FOR EXAMPLE THE MARKET CONDUCT EXAM BOOK OF THE HANDBOOK OF THE IN A I SEE IS ONE THE CONTROLS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT AUTHORITIES RIGHT THERE IN THE CODE AND IT'S SAYS THE CURRENT VERSION OR FUTURE VERSIONS WILL CONTROL. AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE YOU DON'T NECESSARY SEE THE CHANGES THAT BETWEEN THIS ADDITION AND AN EXPEDITION. THAT'S A MORE CLASSIC INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE BECAUSE THEY JUST ADOPTED A NEW HANDBOOK. AND IT AND IT'S ON OUR BOOKS BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS FUTURE. DELEGATION PIECE ESTIMATING. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU MANAGER. QUESTION TOUGH QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU FOR THE EDUCATION I'M TO APPRECIATE YOUR DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE IN AS IT PERTAINS TO INSURANCE SO THANK YOU.
