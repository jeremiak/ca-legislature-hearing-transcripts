00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOW TO COVER THOSE EXCESS COSTS

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:52.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HAVE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:52.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BETWEEN THREE DIFFERENT FONTS

WHICH CAN ONLY BE SPENT ON IP

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SERVICES. AND THEN THE

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

IS COVERED BY LOCAL GENERAL

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:09.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PURPOSE FUNDS SO THAT THESE ARE

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:10.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FUNDS REDIRECTED FROM OTHER

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SOURCES IN MANY CASES LCF.

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:15.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT THE INTENT OF THAT LOCAL

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GENERAL PURPOSE CONTRIBUTION IS

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS HAVE AN

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCENTIVE. TO KEEP THEIR SPECIAL

EDUCATION COSTS AS LOW AS IT IS

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:26.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS POSSIBLE AS WHILE STILL

PROVIDING ADEQUATE SERVICES.

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:29.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE SPECIFIC SHARE OF THESE

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COSTS IS REPRESENTED IN THE

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:33.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIGURE ON PAGE TWO THAT'S THAT'S

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:34.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN THE MOST RECENT DATE IN TWO

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. THAT

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:37.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SHOWS THAT THE LOCAL GENERAL

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PURPOSE CONTRIBUTION NOW MAKES

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:42.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UP THE MAJORITY OF EXPENDITURES

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:44.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:46.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

YEAR.

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:50.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOW THAT SHARE HAS CHANGED AWFUL

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:51.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOT OVER TIME IT'S BEEN GROWING

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:54.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR MANY YEARS WE'LL TALK A

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THAT IS.

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:56.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT FOR NOW WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON THAT SLICE LABELED STATES

SLICES HAS GONE THROUGH AT LEAST

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THREE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY.

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:09.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ON PAGE THREE WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EARLIEST HISTORY OF A STATE

AND A SPECIFIC TYPE OF SERVICE.

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:28.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR SUPPORTING THAT DISABILITY

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:31.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PATCHWORK SYSTEM HAD SEVERAL

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PROBLEMS FIRST IT WAS NOT

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:39.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VERY COMPLICATED THERE ARE MANY

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RULES THAT HAD TO BE FOLLOWED

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND MASTERED. AND THIRD IT HAD

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:45.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME INCENTIVE PROBLEMS NAMELY.

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS THE

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATE INTRODUCED A SOMEWHAT

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM STARTING IN

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NINETEEN EIGHTY. THIS IS

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE J. FIFTY

INSTEAD OF HAVING A DISABILITY

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:14.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPECIFIC TYPE REGIME WE'RE GOING

BASED ON THE FUNDING RATES

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

MATCH THE COST OF PROVIDING

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:20.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THOSE SERVICES AS OPPOSED TO

SERVING THEM IN A MAINSTREAM

WAS NOT SUFFICIENT.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO ADDRESS THOSE INCENTIVE

00:14:29.468 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE COMPLEXITY THE STATE

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:33.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTRODUCED ITS CURRENT SYSTEM.

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:34.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THAT

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SCRIBED ON PAGE FOUR. SINCE

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:37.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AS A P. SIX OR TWO AND IT'S IT'S

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BASED PRIMARILY ON ONE FACTOR

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHICH IS OVERALL STUDENT

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:44.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ATTENDANCE.

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO AGAIN FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:47.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO SELL PLAYERS UNDER THIS

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEM. IS DISTRIBUTED BASED ON

00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:51.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:53.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAN HE'D SELL. SERVICE

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY OF THE

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:56.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
STUDENTS.

00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAVE DISABILITIES OR WHAT.

00:14:58.497 --> 00:14:59.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPECIFIC SERVICES THOSE STUDENTS

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:02.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
RECEIVE.

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
US. AND ONCE A SUB OF RECEIVES

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE TOTAL FUNDING AMOUNT THE

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:07.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOAP THAT MAKES A DECISION ABOUT

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:13.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BETWEEN ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS.

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:15.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO THE EIGHTY SIX TO TWO HAS

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACHIEVED MANY OF ITS INITIAL

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:17.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
PROP.

00:15:17.516 --> 00:15:20.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POLICY GOALS IS MUCH SIMPLER

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAN THE SYSTEM THEY REPLACED.

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:24.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND ALSO UNDER AB SIXTY TWO

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:25.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:27.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
STUDENTS WITH SEVERE

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:28.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISABILITIES WHO ARE SERVED IN

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:30.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MAINSTREAM ENVIRONMENTS. IT'S

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:31.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
APPROXIMATELY DOUBLED FROM ABOUT

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIFTEEN PERCENT THE YEAR BEFORE

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:36.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHTY SIX A TWO TO ABOUT THIRTY

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:38.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT IN THE MOST RECENT DATA.

00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:39.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HOWEVER THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:40.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:43.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT THE BASICS OF TO MODEL AND

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE OUTLINED THOSE CONCERNS OR

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOME OF THEM ON THE LAST TWO

00:15:46.912 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
PAGES OF THE HANDOUT.

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SO THE FIRST IS THAT. THE

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:51.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SPECIFIC RATES THAT ARE

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:53.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GENERATED UNDER EIGHTY SIX TO

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:55.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TWO VERY QUITE NOTABLY BETWEEN

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:56.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SELFLESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THIS IS BECAUSE WE. WE.

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:01.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
GRANDFATHERED IN.

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:02.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A LOT OF THE INEQUITIES THAT

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:04.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXISTED IN THE PREVIOUS FNDING

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MODEL WHEN WE. INITIALLY SET UP

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:08.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE EIGHTY SIX A TO MODEL.

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:10.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSEQUENTLY IN THE MOST RECENT

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:12.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
YEAR.

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:15.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STUDENT RATES RANGED FROM LESS

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAN A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE LOWEST FUNDED SUPPLEMENTS

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:19.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:21.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOLLARS FOR. THE HIGHEST FUNDING

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SOMETHING.

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
TWO. MODEL IS THAT THE

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION HERE IS

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:33.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT OVERALL STUDENT ATTENDANCE

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS A GOOD PROXY FOR SPCIAL

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:37.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EDUCATION COSTS THE IDEA BEYOND

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT. LARGER DISTRICTS WILL

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:40.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IDENTIFY MORE STUDENTS AND THUS

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE. MORE SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
COSTS THAN SMALLER.

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:46.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
DISTRICTS.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE DO NO EMPIRICALLY THAT THAT

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:50.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ASSUMPTION IS NOT TRUE THAT IN

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:52.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
IN FACT THE.

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:53.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IDENTIFICATION RATE FOR SPECIAL

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EDUCATION VARIES QUITE NOTABLY

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:57.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THROUGHOUT THE STATE SOME

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:59.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SELFLESS IDENTIFY LESS THAN TEN

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:00.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PERCENT OF THEIR STUDENTS FOR

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SPECIAL EDUCATION.

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OTHERS IDENTIFY NEARLY TWENTY

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:05.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PERCENT.

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:08.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THESE RATES AT VERY FROM MANY

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
REASONS BOTH.

00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:11.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE UNDERLYING INCIDENCE OF

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
DISABILITIES FAIRIES A

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GEOGRAPHICALLY AND ALSO

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
PRACTICES AND.

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:18.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INVOLVING HOW STUDENTS ARE

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IDENTIFIED AND DETERMINED TO BE

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:22.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:25.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
VERY THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:27.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS RISING

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:30.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MUCH FASTER THAN TOTAL FUNDING

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:33.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNDER EIGHTY SIX TO TWO. IN FACT

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:36.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN MOST RECENT YEARS MOST AREAS

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:38.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THE STATE HAVE EXPERIENCED ON

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:39.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE ONE HAND DECREASING THEIR

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:41.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TOTAL STUDENT ATTENDANCE WHICH

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MEANS THAT THEIR TOTAL FUNDING

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNDER EIGHTY SIX OR TWO HAS BEEN

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THE THE TWELVE PERCENT TWO

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT WOULD STILL BE THE SAME.

00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:09.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT THE DIFFERENCE MAY VERY WELL

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:10.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BE SIMILAR YEAH.

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND THEN. DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:15.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:27.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IT IS AN INTERESTING.

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:29.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARYAN SPECIAL EDUCATION LAW

00:20:29.995 --> 00:20:32.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:34.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW THIRTY FORTY FIFTY

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:36.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERCENT GREATER. AND SO I THINK

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:37.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT'S SOMETHING CERTAINLY

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:39.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:40.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND ALSO TO NOTE THAT SINCE.

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:42.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THIS IS KIND OF A LEGACY

00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:43.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CATEGORICAL IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:46.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GROWTH IN LC AFFECT THE LAST FEW

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEARS. AT HUGE INCREASES BUT IF

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:49.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU LOOK AT THE STATUTORY COLA.

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:53.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MINIMAL SO. IT COMPOUNDS THAT.

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:55.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT INEQUITY GOING FORWARD AND

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO

00:22:56.675 --> 00:22:57.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE TO THE CHART YOU HAD A

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:59.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NUMBER ONE AS FAR AS THE THE

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:02.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMMON. TYPES OF STUDENTS AS FAR

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AS THAT DISABILITIES AND IN THIS

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:05.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
UP STRUCK ME FOR A COUPLE

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:08.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REASONS ONE. I WAS A LITTLE KID

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAS IN A SPEECH CLASS I HAD AT.

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:13.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE ALL STAR STUTTERING ISSUE

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SPENT THAT FROM KINDERGARTEN

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:16.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THROUGH FOURTH GRADE BEING

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:18.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PULLED OUT GOING TO THAT. SPEECH

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:20.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERAPISTS AND SENSE IT WORKED

00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:21.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UP TO FOURTH GRADE SO WHAT IT

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SHOWS HERE IS ESSENTIALLY. MY

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:24.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
LIFE.

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:26.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT BUT I I WONDER IF YOU SEE

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:28.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE HUGE HUGE GROWTH IN THE

00:23:28.774 --> 00:23:31.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEARNING DISORDER POPULATION.

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:31.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:33.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND HOW IS THAT CHANGED OVER

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:35.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEARS AND AND ARE THERE ANY.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROMISING TRENDS TO TO START

00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:39.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EARLIER BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THE DISORDER PEACE IF YOU

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOK AT GRADES K. THROUGH. TWO

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE DON'T SPEND A LOT OF MONEY WE

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:47.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPEND A TON OF MONEY FROM GRADES

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:49.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THREE THROUGH TWELVE SO WHAT DO

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:51.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE DO AS FAR AS. DOING EARLIER

00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:53.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INTERVENTION I KNOW THAT.

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:55.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CERTAINLY A PRE K. IS A PRETTY

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:57.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
PROMISING.

00:23:57.569 --> 00:24:00.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT BASICALLY REMEDY AND SHOWS

00:24:00.972 --> 00:24:03.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT KIDS GET A QUALITY. PRE K.

00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN LESSON THAT

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:08.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE TRACK FOR SPECIAL ED DOWN

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ROAD SO MAYBE CAN ENLIGHTEN

00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:12.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
US THERE.

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:12.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEAH THE IT IS AN INTERESTING

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:13.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STORY WITH SPECIFIC LEARNING

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISORDERS WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS IS

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:15.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO. DIAGNOSE

00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:15.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A SPECIFIC WARNING DISORDER

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:16.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INTEL ITSELF HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO

00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:17.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
RELATIVELY.

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:19.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HIGH LEVEL CURRICULUM BUT A LOT

00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:21.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THESE DISORDERS ARE SPECIFIC

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:24.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO. THE CHILD HAS DIFFICULTY

00:24:24.563 --> 00:24:26.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEARNING HOW TO READ OR LEARNING

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:27.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HOW TO DO MATH AND SO.

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:30.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OFTENTIMES THESE GO UNDIAGNOSED

00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:31.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND TELL THE LATER GRADE

00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:33.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT REASON. IN

00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:36.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOME CASES A CHILD IS IDENTIFIED

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:38.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AS NEEDING SPECIAL SUPPORT

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:39.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEFORE HAND AND THEY JUST DON'T

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVETHE NAME FOR IT YET. SO

00:24:41.346 --> 00:24:42.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SOME OF THESE CHILDREN ARE

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LABELED AS HAVING A DIFFERENT

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:47.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISABILITY AND EARLIER GRADES

00:24:47.452 --> 00:24:49.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND AND THAT WOULD SPEAK TO WHAT

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:50.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT THE

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IMPORTANCE OF. EARLY

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:53.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IDENTIFICATION.

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:56.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IMAGES LATER ON THAT.

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:58.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IT IS DISCOVERED THAT THE

00:24:58.563 --> 00:24:59.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
APPROPRIATE NAME FOR THE

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:02.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DISORDER IS FOR INSTANCE

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:03.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DYSLEXIA.

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:06.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF COURSE THE LAST DECADE OR SO

00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:08.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE'RE HEARING MORE AS FAR AS.

00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:11.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT ADHD AND TO AND THOSE

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:12.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ISSUES OR WHAT CAN YOU TELL US

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:13.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
AS FAR AS THE.

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:16.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE TRENDS DISABILITY GROUPS AS

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FAR AS WHICH ONES ARE GROWING

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:20.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHICH ONES ARE ARE DECLINING.

00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:21.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHETHER THAT FISCAL IMPLICATIONS

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
FOR THESE.

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:26.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
YEAH THE.

00:25:26.224 --> 00:25:29.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A VERY BRIEF SYNOPSIS IS THAT.

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:30.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THE RELATIVELY MILD

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:32.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISABILITIES THAT ARE CALLED OUT

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HERE SO SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS AND

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:35.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEARNING DISORDERS HAVE BEEN

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:37.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT FLAT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AN INFECTED DECLINED A LITTLE

00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:41.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OVER THE LAST. TEN YEARS WHERE

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS THE INCIDENCE OF ALL OTHER

00:25:43.608 --> 00:25:46.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISABILITIES HAS INCREASED AND

00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR THE MOST PART THAT INCREASES

00:25:47.812 --> 00:25:49.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEEN DRIVEN BY A SINGLE CATEGORY

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:51.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WHICH IS AUTISM.

00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:52.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:54.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE DIAGNOSED

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:58.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WITH AUTISM. AS I I BELIEVE

00:25:58.123 --> 00:26:00.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABOUT TRIPLED OVER THE LAST.

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:04.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS IT'S BEEN.

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:07.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A. SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT BY

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:09.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ITSELF THE CATEGORY OF AUTISM

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN ONE

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:13.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE GROWTH IN

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:14.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THIS SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:15.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POPULATION OVER THE LAST TEN

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
YEARS.

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:20.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OKAY. AT FISCAL EVEN ASKED ABOUT

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:20.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:22.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:26:22.113 --> 00:26:23.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE AUTISM

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TEND TO REQUIRE RELATIVELY

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SEVERE.

00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:29.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INTENSIVE SUPPORTS. THOSE

00:26:29.587 --> 00:26:31.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
INCLUDE ONE ON ONE PAIR

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:33.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROFESSIONAL AIDS A SPEECH

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERAPIST PHYSICAL THERAPIST. IF

00:26:35.593 --> 00:26:37.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
YOU LOOK AT.

00:26:37.295 --> 00:26:39.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EMPLOYMENT IN THOSE SPECIFIC

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:40.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AREAS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS IN

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:42.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS THEY'VE

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INCREASED BY ABOUT TWENTY

00:26:43.568 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT'S

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:47.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CERTAINLY REFLECTED IN THE

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:49.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXPENDITURE AREA AND HAS BEEN A

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SIGNIFICANT COST DRIVER FOR

00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:52.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THOSE DISTRICTS BUT IT'S

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PROBABLE THAT BEFORE THE

00:26:53.878 --> 00:26:56.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCREASE IN AUTISM THE SAME TYPE

00:26:56.614 --> 00:26:59.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
OF STUDENTS WERE. CATEGORIZED
IN.

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:01.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GENERAL. DISORDER AND NOT

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NECESSARILY. CATEGORIES AUTISM

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:06.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT THEY WERE RECEIVING SPECIAL

ED SERVICES.

YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:12.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK THE UNDERLYING QUESTION IS

00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:15.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHY HAS THE INCIDENCE OF AUTISM

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:17.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BEEN INCREASING DOES THIS.

REPRESENTS AN ACTUAL INCREASE IN

00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:22.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE NUMBER OF OF STUDENTS WHO

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%

IDENTIFYING AND DIAGNOSING.

00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:33.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AUTISM SUCH THAT. STUDENTS WHO

USED TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:36.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SOMETHING ELSE ARE NOW

CLASSIFIED AS AUTISM.

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:39.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
RESEARCH REALLY HAS NOT.

00:27:39.657 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A SOLIDIFIED AROUND A SINGLE

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:44.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ANSWER ONE ONE THING TO NOTE IS

00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:46.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THIS RECENT TREND IN AUTISM

00:27:46.564 --> 00:27:48.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA IN

THAT BE A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN
IT.

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%

MANY MANY SCHOOLS WOULD BE

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:09.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAPPY TO SEE THAT INCREASE YES

THAT OKAY YEAH I'M.

00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:25.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
QUICK QUESTION QUESTION NUMBER

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWO YOU WERE SAYING HOW IT DOES

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:29.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO POPULATIONS LIKE HOVERING

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:31.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO TWENTY

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:34.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT. SO SOME. ARE THERE SOME

00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:36.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE MORE

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:37.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IDENTIFY STUDENTS SIR AS HAVING

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOMEONE I ONE OF MYCHILDREN WAS

00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:43.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPECIAL NEEDS. AND IT'S A VERY

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:44.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF YOU'RE NOT SOPHISTICATED TO

00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:46.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NAVIGATE THAT PROCESS IS VERY

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFICULT SO I WONDER IF THERE'S

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
A DISPARITY AMONG.

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:53.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICT EDGES.

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:55.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT. SOCIAL ECONOMIC LEVEL SO

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:58.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PEOPLE WHO MAYBE OR ARE.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISADVANTAGE ECONOMICALLY DON'T

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:01.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE THOSE TOOLS TO NAVIGATE THE

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEM IS THERE ANY ANY DATA ON

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:05.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:07.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT ONE

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:11.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESENT THE INCIDENCE OF STUDENTS

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:13.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN SPECIAL EDUCATION FAIRIES IS

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:16.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL LEVEL

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:18.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POLICIES FAIRY AND DOES MAKE A

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BIG DIFFERENCE IN IDENTIFICATION

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:20.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:22.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISENTANGLE THAT FROM THIS OTHER

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUESTION OF DOES THE UNDERLYING

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:26.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INCIDENCE OF DISABILITIES FAIRY

00:30:26.724 --> 00:30:28.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I'M I'M NOT. AWARE OF ANY

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STUDIES THAT SPECIFICALLY

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:32.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
ATTEMPT TO DISENTANGLE THOSE
TWO.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT ABOUT IT HELD? AT WHAT

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT THERE HURDLES FOR PARENTS

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:39.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN AT TWO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IT'S CERTAINLY.

00:30:40.638 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IT IN MANY CASES A VERY

00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:45.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFICULT SYSTEM FOR PARENTS TO.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:48.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAID NAVIGATE PARENTS OF COURSE.

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:50.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OFTEN COME IN WITH NO EXPERTISE

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:52.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ARE FAMILIAR. WITH THIS.

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:55.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH THIS AREA AND AS I THINK

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU'LL LEARN FROM SUBSEQUENT

00:30:57.855 --> 00:30:59.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
PANELISTS EVEN.

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:01.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:02.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE DEATH DECADES OF EXPERTISE

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:04.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STILL GET TRIPPED UP. SO I I

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:08.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK THAT CERTAINLY IN AN ISSUE

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:09.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
IS SOMETHING THAT.

00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:10.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:11.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE

00:32:21.372 --> 00:32:21.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%

DO THIS.

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:43.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

MUCH MORE INTENSIVE SUPPORTS.

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:50.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

THE OTHER HAND RESEARCH DOES

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:06.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
INDICATE THAT WHEN.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE SPECIAL

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:18.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RESPOND TO THAT OF FISCAL

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:35.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHICH CAN RESULT IN THEIR

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:37.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE SUFFERING

00:37:37.488 --> 00:37:38.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SO IT IS IT. IS A CAREFUL

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:40.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BALANCE THAT HAS TO BE STRUCK

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BETWEEN PROVIDING ADEQUATE

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:45.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THERE ARE NO INAPPROPRIATE

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:47.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCENTIVES. VIOLENT MEN FOLLOW

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:48.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
UP ON THAT I MEAN.

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:50.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:52.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF THAT BUT

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I I I I FIND IT INTERESTING

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:58.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
POLICY APPROACH TO SAY THAT
WELL.

00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:59.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INSTEAD IF APPROPRIATE FUNDING

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:02.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
BASED ON NEED.

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:03.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH YOU KNOW WE WE CAN LOOK AT

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:04.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOW WE CREATE INCENTIVES ARE

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:07.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
JUST INTENSE BUT. THE OTHER BUT.

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:10.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:38:10.087 --> 00:38:12.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WORD ACTUALLY ALLOW. THIS

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CERTAIN RATE MAYBE GETTING. US

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:15.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SINCE YOU ACTUALLY NEED SERVICES

00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:18.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CROWDED OUT BY SOMEONEELSE BY

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:20.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
OTHERS WHO MAY HAVE HIGH
DEMANDS.

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:21.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND AND I THINK WHEN WE TALK

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:22.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ABOUT YOU KNOW SMALL SCHOOL

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:24.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISTRICT TALK ABOUT SOMEONE IS

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:26.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
REALLY EXPENSIVE.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OR NOT THAT SIMPLY SAY HIGH

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:30.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
INCIDENCE. BY TALKING ONE OR
TWO.

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:31.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
NOT TALKING ABOUT.

00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SUDDENLY THEY GOT A HUGE NUMBER

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:34.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
RATE IN FACT ACTUALLY IS

00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:35.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTERESTING BECAUSE HE POINTED

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:36.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUT THAT OF THE THREE IS THE

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THREE THINGS THE STATE ACTUALLY

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:40.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOESN'T JUST MINUTES ORTHOPEDIC

00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:41.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
IMPAIRMENT.

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:42.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
HE SAID.

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:43.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A NIGHTLINE EXACTLY IMPAIRED

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:46.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RIGHTS AND AND IF YOU ADD THOSE

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWO UP ACCORDING TO YOUR CHART.

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OR THE IMPAIRMENT REPRESENTS

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:52.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POINT TOO AND THAT DEFINITELY

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LINE REPRESENTS LISTEN POINT OF

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:54.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FIVE SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:57.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
STATE JUST MEANT FOR
ESSENTIALLY.

00:38:57.635 --> 00:39:01.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A FRACTION BUS ABOUT. YOU KNOW

00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:03.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIKE A QUARTER OF A PERCENT OF

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:05.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE STUDENTS OF THE OF THE TOTAL

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:07.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POPULATION WE CAN RECALCULATED

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:08.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR PERCENTAGE OF. THOSE IN

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:10.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SPECIAL ED SO.

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:12.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO REALLY IT'S I MEAN BIZZARE

00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:14.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THEY THEY MAY HAVE.

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO NAVIGATE NEEDS AN EXPENSE

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WISE BUT I THINK IT'S. I THINK

00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT.

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:21.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WHAT PORTION?

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:22.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:23.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCENTIVES ARE DISINCENTIVES BUT

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:27.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT PORTION. OF THE NEED IS

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:29.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE WHAT'S KNOWN FOR TWO.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IF YOU HAVE A SMALL SCHOOL

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:32.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DISTRICT.

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YOU KNOW YOU'RE FACED WITH

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:34.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NINETEEN THIS IS SOMETHING WE

00:39:34.805 --> 00:39:35.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEE IN HEALTHCARE TO WRITE ITS

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:37.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADVERSE SELECTION WHAT HAPPENS

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:39.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS THAT YOU HAVE ONE DAY OFF YOU

00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:40.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VERY EXPENSIVE PEOPLE. AND THAT

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAN CROWD OUT AND IF YOU'VE GOT

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:44.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST GOING TO DO IT BASED ON

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:45.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POPULATION YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE

00:39:45.249 --> 00:39:47.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCOUNT OF VARIATION RIGHT SO IF

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:47.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU HAVE ONE VERY EXPENSIVE

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:49.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:53.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPECIAL ED IS THE ONLY BEING ON

YOUR TOTAL POPULATION. ESTIMATE

YOU DON'T COUNT THREE AND FOUR

00:39:58.129 --> 00:39:59.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEAR OLDS. ARE THE OTHER THING

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:11.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOES NOT ACTUALLY FOR LIKE THE

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:12.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
CURRENT SCIENCE.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THERE'S A GROWING BODY OF

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:15.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THE

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:18.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INCREASE IN AUTISM RATES IS DUE

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:19.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:39.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROBABLY YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:41.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TENANTS ARE THERE'S BEEN

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:42.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RESEARCH DONE FOR EXAMPLE IN

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:43.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ENGLAND.

00:40:43.874 --> 00:40:46.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE BACK AND.

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REASSESS THE SAMPLE POPULATION

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:50.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
USING A STANDARDIZED MEASURES

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOK OF CAT TRACTORS AUTISM AND

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IDENTIFY AND ACTUALLY FOUND OUT

00:40:54.418 --> 00:40:55.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT THE DOLLS WHO WERE

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:56.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM BEFORE

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:58.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHEN THEIR CHILDREN X. WE HAD

00:40:58.189 --> 00:40:59.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIFFERENT SECRETARIAT. ACTUALLY

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HAD THE SAME RATES AS THE

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:02.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
CHILDREN SO.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BASICALLY EMPHASIZING THAT

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:06.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROBABLY VEE SAYS PEOPLE ALWAYS

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAD AUTISM WE JUST HAD DIFFERENT

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SETS OF CRITERIA AND THOSE HAVE

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:12.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHANGED OVER TIME SO YOU GO INTO

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A STANDARDIZED. DIRECTORY AND

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:14.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEY WOULD SEND EXAMPLE THE

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:17.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POPULATION AND WE EVALUATE THEM.

00:41:17.374 --> 00:41:18.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S YOU KNOW YOU GET THE SAME

00:41:18.475 --> 00:41:19.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RATE FOR OLDER PEOPLE THAN A

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHILL AS THE CHILDREN SO I THINK

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:23.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE BODY OF

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RESEARCH IS MOVING IN THAT

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:27.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIRECTION I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:31.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT STATEMENT. THAT YOU MADE

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:31.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
EARLIER.

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:33.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
AND THE CENTER.

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:36.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTUALLY FOR THAT DOCTOR. DOCTOR

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:43.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THANK YOU DOCTOR YES.

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:44.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I THINK SO MUCH ON THE INCENTIVE

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:46.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
QUESTION.

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:48.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ANOTHER. ISSUE THAT I

00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:49.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
POTENTIALLY SEE IS THAT.

00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:51.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISTRICTS THAT DO A REALLY GOOD

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:52.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
JOB WITH SPECIAL ED WILL TEND TO

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:54.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ATTRACT FAMILIES WITH KIDS WITH

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SPECIAL NEEDS.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:56.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT THEN THEY'RE NOT REWARDED

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FOR THAT ACTUALLY ENDS UP

00:41:57.514 --> 00:41:59.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STRAINING THEIR BUDGETS AND SO

00:41:59.216 --> 00:42:00.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT MIGHT REDUCE THE INCENTIVE

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:02.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO. REALLY PROVIDE EFFECTIVE

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:03.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SERVICE IN THE FIRST PLACE IS

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:04.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS I DID ADMIT THAT YOU SEE

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:06.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PLAY OUT.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I ATE CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:11.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEAR ABOUT A LOT A IT'S. A IT'S

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
A DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY.

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:16.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT IS A COMMON EXPLANATION

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:18.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FOR WHY THERE IS SO MUCH

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:19.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
VARIATION AND THE RATE OF

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IDENTIFICATION BETWEEN SELFLESS

00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:22.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
ACTS.

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
DO YOU.

00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:25.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW YOU

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:27.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAN ADDRESS THAT WLL THEN YOU

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:28.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KNOW RUNNING INTO THE OTHER

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:30.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROBLEM WITH INCENTIVES OF.

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:33.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DEALING WITH CLASSIFICATION.

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:35.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WELL I I THINK THE STATE HAS

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:38.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MANY OPTIONS FOR ALLOCATING

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:38.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
FUNDING.

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:40.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:42.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BUT EACH ONE WOULD HAVE

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:44.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DISSOCIATED STRENGTHS AND

00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:46.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WEAKNESSES I I MEAN. FOR EXAMPLE

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE COULD USE ONE OF THE METHODS

00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:50.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN USED IN

00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE STATE EITHER FUNDING BASED

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ON THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:56.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE OFFERED. OR FUNDING BASED ON

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE TYPES OF DISABILITIES SOUND.

00:42:58.309 --> 00:43:00.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT THE

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATE HAD WITH THE SPECIFIC

00:43:01.545 --> 00:43:03.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEMS ARE MIXED BUT PERHAPS WE

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CAN IMPROVE ON THE SPECIFIC

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:06.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WEAKNESSES OF OF THOSE.

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:07.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ALTERNATIVELY.

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AT LEAST THEORETICALLY THE

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:12.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATE COULD. FIND THE SPECIAL

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:14.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EDUCATION ON A REIMBURSEMENT

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:17.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
METHOD A FEW STATES USE THAT.

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:19.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THAT RUNS INTO.

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:21.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SEPARATE SET OF CHALLENGES

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:23.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INVOLVING HOW DO YOU HIDE IT.

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:26.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
EXPENDITURE CLAIMS BUT.

00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:27.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT'S IT'S POTENTIALLY THAT

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:29.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COULD BE WORKED THROUGH I I

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE

00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:32.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MANY OPTIONS FOR DEALING WITH.

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:37.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH THESE ISSUES IF IF THAT WAS

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:41.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
A MAJOR CONCERN YES.

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:44.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEAH SOME ON PAGE FOR YOU YOUR

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:45.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SECOND BALL IT SORT OF DOES A

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GOOD JOB OF US IS UNDER THE

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FUNDING. SYSTEM THE STATE

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROVIDES SELF AS WITH FUNDING

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:51.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BASED ON TOTAL STUDENT

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:53.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ATTENDANCE. REGARDLESS OF HOW

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MANY STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:58.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPECIAL ED. EDUCATION OR HOW THE

00:43:58.502 --> 00:44:00.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
STUDENTS ARE SERVED.

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:01.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S SORT OF THE CONCEPT THAT

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:04.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I GET AN EARFUL FROM FROM MY

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:04.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
DISTRICT WITH A HIGH

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:06.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
CONCENTRATION.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OF SPECIAL ED STUDENTS.

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:09.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FINALLY SAYING IT CREATES AN

00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:11.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
UNFAIR.

00:44:11.348 --> 00:44:12.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BURDEN WHERE THEY'RE NOT GETTING

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:14.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COMPENSATED FOR THE ACTUAL

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:16.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT NEED

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:17.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SERVICES.

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:19.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD YOU SAY THAT AB SIX OF

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:22.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
TWO IS A GOOD MODEL.

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD YOU SAY IT'S A SUCCESSFUL

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:24.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
MODEL.

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:44:26.463 --> 00:44:28.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I. I I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:29.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUGGESTS THAT MAYBE SIX OR TWO

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:31.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SUCCEEDED AT THE STATE'S INITIAL

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:32.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
POLICY GOALS WHICH WAS

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SIMPLIFYING THE SYSTEM AND

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:36.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SPECIFICALLY. ELIMINATING

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DISINCENTIVES FOR SERVING

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:39.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS WITH RELATIVELY SEVERE

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:42.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISABILITIES AND MAINSTREAM

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:43.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ENVIRONMENTS.

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:47.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOW WITH ANY POLICY AS BROAD AS.

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:49.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FUNDING SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:51.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE A

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NUMBER OF COMPETING PRIORITIES.

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:57.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
END IN THIS IN THIS INSTANCE IT.

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:58.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE AREA WHERE THE STATE MAY BE

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:01.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAS MOVED AWAY FROM IS. OF BEING

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:03.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LESS PRECISE AND HOW IT TARGETS

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:06.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. FOR

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:08.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SPECIAL EDUCATION ME.

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:11.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IS CERTAINLY IN THE AREA.

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:12.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHERE'D BE LEGITIMATE FOR THE

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ARE

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:15.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE ALTERNATIVES THAT WOULD

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:17.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
IMPROVE UPON IT.

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:18.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
OF COURSE ANY OF THOSE

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:19.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IMPROVEMENTS WILL COME WITH

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:21.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THEIR OWN TRADE OFFS.

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:22.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THAT ACTUALLY IS TO MY NEXT

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:24.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
QUESTION IS THE LA O.

00:45:24.521 --> 00:45:26.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RECOMMENDING. ANY SPECIFIC

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON ALL OF

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:30.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOUR RESEARCH AND DATA. THAT ARE

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:31.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
FAIR.

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:34.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WASTED I MEAN IF YOU WERE KING

00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:35.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW WOULD YOU IMPROVE THE SYSTEM

00:45:35.732 --> 00:45:37.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I GUESS IS MY QUESTION. AT THIS

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:39.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AT THIS TIME THE LA OWES.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:49.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STANDING INEQUITIES IN EIGHTY

00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:53.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEARS WE'VE BEEN. SUGGESTING

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:55.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THESE INEQUITIES ARE BASED

00:45:55.552 --> 00:45:56.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
ON.

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:58.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REALLY THAT SOME HISTORICAL

ACCIDENTS OR ARTIFACTS THAT

00:46:00.858 --> 00:46:03.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE ANYMORE AND

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT AND WE SHOULD BE WORKING

00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:05.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TOWARDS.

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:07.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AT LEAST REALIZING THE INITIAL

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:08.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
VISION OF EIGHTY SIX OR TWO

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:10.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHICH WOULD BE AN EQUAL PERSON

FUNDING RIGHT FOR ALSO

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:14.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:18.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
OKAY THANK YOU.

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:19.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAN I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:21.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THAT A LITTLE BIT.

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS

00:46:22.412 --> 00:46:23.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:25.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. IS.

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:28.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:29.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A MUCH GREATER DIVERSITY IN THE

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:31.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TYPE OF SCHOOLS THAT EXIST IN

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:32.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
OUR SYSTEM.

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:33.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I WAS WITHOUT THE GROWTH OF THE

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:36.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHARTER SCHOOL MOVEMENT. WHICH

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:37.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAS NOW IS NOW TO GETTING UP AT

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:39.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A MUCH MUCH LARGER PORTION OF

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:41.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
OUR STUDENTS.

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:43.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WHERE DOES THAT FIT INTO THE

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CALCULUS. THERE ARE LOTS OF

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:47.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RUMORS OF FLOW BACK BACK AND

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:49.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FORTH FROM BOTH SIDES ABOUT THE

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXTENT TO WHICH THE DISTRICT

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:52.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SCHOOLS IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS

00:46:52.509 --> 00:46:53.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARE.

00:46:53.877 --> 00:46:54.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TAKING ON A CERTAIN PORTION OF

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:55.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:57.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF ARGUMENTS

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:59.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MADE ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:01.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEEDS. ASSOCIATED. IT SEEMS TO

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ME THAT WITH THIS NEW SHIFT IN

00:47:03.253 --> 00:47:04.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE WAY THAT WE'RE EDUCATING SO

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:07.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. THAT THAT

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALONE AT ALL GIVES US THE THE

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:10.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NEED TO REALLY EXAMINE THIS

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:13.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ISSUE. OUT WHAT WE WERE DOING TO

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO TO REALLY LOOK AT WHETHER A

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:17.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STRAIGHT PER PUPIL. ALLOCATION

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:21.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REALLY MAKE SENSE ANYMORE.

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:21.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
IT IS A.

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:25.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. BY A

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:27.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK THE THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE

00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:29.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS AND SPECIAL

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:30.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EDUCATION IS THAT A LOT OF

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:32.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:35.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY. DEPEND ON WHAT WE REFER

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO AS ECONOMIES OF SCALE.

00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:39.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RIGHT IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:43.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO PROVIDE. ADEQUATE SERVICES.

00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:46.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
FOR A POPULATION OF.

00:47:46.763 --> 00:47:48.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WITH REASONABLE COSTS PER

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:49.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STUDENT IF THAT POPULATION IS

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:52.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VERY SMALL SO FOR INSTANCE. OF

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:54.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE POPULATION WHO ARE BLIND OR

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:56.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
VISUALLY IMPAIRED NEED VERY

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPECIFIC SUPPORTS AND SERVICES

00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:00.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BOTH AND STREETS INSTRUCTIONAL.

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:02.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND IN TERMS OF THE MATERIALS

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:04.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE PROVIDED TO THEM. LARGER

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:08.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. A SERVICE.

00:48:08.285 --> 00:48:10.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'D JUST BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIZE

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MORE OF THE STUDENTS AND THUS

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:13.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HAVE.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REASONABLE ACCESS TO THOSE

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:17.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MATERIALS AND ARE ABLE TO EMPLOY

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:20.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A FULL TIME BASIS. APPROPRIATE

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STAFF MEMBERS SMALLER DID SCHOOL

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:24.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISTRICTS. OFTEN STRUGGLE WITH

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:25.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT AND CHARTER SCHOOLS IN

00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:27.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PARTICULAR TO SAY THAT THAT

00:48:27.804 --> 00:48:29.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
WOULD BE.

00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:31.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I THINK THE MAJOR CHALLENGE

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:32.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS.

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:34.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:36.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FOR THAT REASON I SAY IT'S

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POSSIBLE TO AN EVEN ABSENT ANY.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BAD PRACTICES AMONG CHARTER

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:44.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCHOOLS THAT PARENTS OF STUDENTS

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:46.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH SUCH DISABILITIES COULDN'T

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:47.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
EASONABLY.

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:49.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONCLUDE THAT A CHARTER SCHOOL

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS OFTEN NOT THE BEST PLACE FOR

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:53.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THEIR IMPRISONMENT WHICH.

00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:54.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BY ITSELFWOULD MEAN THAT THE

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GROWTH OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL

00:48:56.566 --> 00:48:58.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POPULATION. WILL MEAN THAT THE

00:48:58.535 --> 00:49:01.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH HAVE.

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:02.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADVANTAGES AND ECONOMIES OF

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCALE ARE LEFT BEHIND WITH MORE

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
OF THE STUDENTS.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT. FITS WITH SOME OF THE DATA

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:09.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WE'VE SEEN BUT IT'S IT'S

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:11.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HARD TO. ACTUALLY TEACH OUT A

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:14.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP THERE.

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:16.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RIGHT SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:17.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN AND THIS IS THE MOMENT I WANT

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:19.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO ASK THE NEXT PANEL A SUBSIDY

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO ANOTHER HERE AND SAID LOVE IT

00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:22.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF THEY WOULD COULD ADDRESS THIS

00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:23.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
ISSUE BUT.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I'M SO INTERESTED IN THIS

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:25.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HISTORICAL SHIFT I APPRECIATE

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
YOUR PRESENTATION.

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:30.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
END OF THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%

TEAM TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT

00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:39.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXISTED RIGHT THAT THERE WAS A

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:39.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THERE WAS AN INCENTIVE

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%

00:49:45.582 --> 00:49:47.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MORE SEVERE NEEDS BECAUSE

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:48.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EVERYONE KNEW THEY GET MORE

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:50.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. ADEN

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT NOW GIVEN THAT THE SHIFT IN

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:53.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE WAY THEY WERE EDUCATING OUR

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:54.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KIDS IN THE IN THE IN THE MIX OF

AND. I WON IT I I GUESS I GUESS

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:01.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE QUESTION IS IF WE'RE GONNA

00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:04.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF WE WANT TO. REFORM MAYBE SIX

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:05.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OH TWO TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT BACK

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:07.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE DIRECTION OF WHAT WE HAD

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:09.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BEFORE NINETY EIGHT. AND HOW

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:12.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD WE CRAFT LEGISLATION TO.

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:14.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO NOT FALL INTO THE SAME

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:14.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROBLEMS THAT THEY WERE TRYING

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO FIX WITH SIX OF TWO IT MAY BE

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THAT'S A BIG QUESTION. AND.

00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:20.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GREAT ANSWER

YEAR WHICH STILL IN PROGRESS I

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALSO HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO

00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:13.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ANALYZE THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DATA THAT JUST CAME OUT SO. THE

WAS A LITTLE OVER THIRTEEN

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:21.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
BILLION DOLLARS THIRTEEN
BILLION.

00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:23.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
AND SO.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT AND AND THAT IS PRIMARILY

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:28.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THROUGH THE STATE ALLOCATION OF

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:28.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
FUNDS THAT.

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:31.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INOTES ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY OF

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:32.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT IS COVERED BY LOCAL GENERAL

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:34.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%

ALLOCATION WAS ALL A LITTLE

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LESS THAN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:43.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO IT COVERED A LITTLE LESS THAN

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE

00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:48.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXPENDITURES. AND SO DID THE

00:51:48.104 --> 00:51:50.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NEWS. DOES THAT MEAN THAT

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:52.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

FUNDING FOR MY THROUGH

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:57.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

DISTRICTS THAT'S CORRECT.

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:02.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:52:02.552 --> 00:52:03.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:17.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FEDERAL ID A THAT THE THE

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:18.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED

ASPIRATIONAL LANGUAGE ATTACHED

00:52:32.048 --> 00:52:34.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO THAT THAT. THE FEDERAL

THERE.

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:43.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PLEDGE WAS TO PROVIDE FORTY

KNOW WHAT THAT FIGURE

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:54.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
CORRESPONDS TO.

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:57.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN TODAY'S DOLLARS A BELIEVE IT

FORTY PERCENT OF TOTAL SPECIAL

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EDUCATION EXPENDITURES BUT IT'S

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:06.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CERTAINLY MUCH. MUCH GREATER

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:10.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAN. THE FED'S CURRENTLY GIVE

LANGUAGE AND AND THE FEDERAL LAW

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:17.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THAT. WOULD.

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:19.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
GIVE THE STATE.

BELIEVE THAT THERE IS.

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE STATE HAS ANY LEGAL

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:26.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STANDING TO THAT I BELIEVE IT

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:29.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAS JUST ASPIRATIONAL LANGUAGE.

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%

WHICH IS FOR US RIGHT NOW. A.

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:09.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:59:09.345 --> 00:59:11.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE A LEVEL OF URGENCY AND HOW

OUTCOMES SICK EXACTLY EXACTLY

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:22.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND ONE OF THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:24.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HEARING THROUGHOUT IS IT IS

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:26.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPORTANCE OF. OF SUPPORTING OUR

KIDS AT AT A YOUNGER AGE AND AND

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:31.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
ONE OF THINGS THAT I SEE IS
THAT.

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:32.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BY THE TIME STUDENTS ARE

00:59:41.444 --> 00:59:42.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT EARLY INTERVENTION IS NOT

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:44.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS IS NOT MAKING THE INROADS

THERE WOULD BE A HUGE SHORTAGE

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN SPECIAL EDUCATION I WAS

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXTREMELY NAIVE. THAT WAS MY

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:52.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:52.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INDEPENDENT FROM THE DISTRICT

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:54.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OKAY SO INDEPENDENT OF THE

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISTRICT AID IS VERY DIFFICULT

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:58.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUST BECAUSE OF SCALE. FOR THE

01:49:58.458 --> 01:50:00.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INDEPENDENT CHARTERS TO SUPPORT

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:01.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SPECIALIST STUDENTS AND

01:50:01.962 --> 01:50:03.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
TYPICALLY WE RECEIVE A

01:50:04.064 --> 01:50:05.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER ARE FROM

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:08.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INDEPENDENCE. SCHOOL STUDENTS

01:50:08.234 --> 01:50:10.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMING TO THE DISTRICT BECAUSE

01:50:10.337 --> 01:50:12.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF LACK OF SERVICES OF OUR LACK

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:14.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF SYSTEMS IN PLACE YOU KNOW

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:16.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SPECIFICALLY FOR SPECIAL ED

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:19.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
STUDENTS. WHO?

WE HAVE OF.

01:50:21.081 --> 01:50:22.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND OUR THIRTEEN CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:24.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEIR SPECIAL ED POPULATION

01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:25.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMPRISES FOUR PERCENT OF THEIR

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:27.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TOTAL POPULATION WORDS OVER

01:50:27.554 --> 01:50:29.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIRTEEN PERCENT FOR A DISTRICT

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:30.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
THAT CAN AND DO YOU THINK
THAT'S.

01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:33.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S SAD BY BY CHOICE THAT THAT

01:50:33.626 --> 01:50:34.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S DECISIONS BEING MADE TO

01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:36.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MAKE TO HAVE THOSE NUMBERS

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:38.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
REFLECT THAT A WORK.

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON I I

01:50:39.566 --> 01:50:41.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK IT'S COMPLICATED I THINK.

01:50:41.534 --> 01:50:44.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME FOLKS ALREADY TALKED ABOUT

01:50:44.337 --> 01:50:46.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT I THINK WAS THE LA O. ABOUT

01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:47.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT A DISTRICT CAN PROVIDE

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALTHOUGH WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO

01:50:49.943 --> 01:50:51.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ABOUT HALF OF OUR CHARTER

01:50:51.344 --> 01:50:53.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCHOOLS. SO I WOULD HAVE TO TALK

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:54.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO THE SPECIAL ED FOLKS A LITTLE

01:50:54.748 --> 01:50:56.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MORE TO SEE IF THEY ACTUALLY

01:50:56.249 --> 01:51:01.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
HAVE DATA ON THAT.

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:03.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OKAY. DON'T SEE ANY OTHER.

01:51:03.823 --> 01:51:05.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTERESTING ANSWER ASKING THIS

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:07.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
QUESTION SO MY MY NEXT ONE IS

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:07.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:09.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS FAR AS THAT THAT THAT THE

01:51:09.129 --> 01:51:10.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
FUNDING.

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:12.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE STRUCTURE AND MODEL.

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:14.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE THERE WAYS IN WHICH OUR

01:51:14.467 --> 01:51:16.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
FUNDING MODEL CREATES

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:18.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISINCENTIVES TO SERVING SPECIAL

01:51:18.171 --> 01:51:20.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ED STUDENTS IN MAINSTREAM

01:51:20.206 --> 01:51:23.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ENVIRONMENTS.

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:26.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
FROM THE.

01:51:26.246 --> 01:51:27.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR INSTANCE THE MAKES IT MORE

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:28.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHALLENGING THAN AN AS AND AS A

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:29.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC EYE WOULD I

01:51:29.649 --> 01:51:30.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I

01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:32.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABSOLUTELY NOT I WANT TO SERVE

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:33.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE

01:51:33.787 --> 01:51:35.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FUNDING GAPS ARE. AS IS DISTRICT

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:37.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SUPERINTENDENT AND I THINK AS A

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:38.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CEO WE I I THINK THEY WOULD ASK

01:51:38.958 --> 01:51:40.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MY CBO WOULD BE SAYING THE

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROBLEM IS HOW DO WE DO THIS

01:51:42.228 --> 01:51:44.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. SO I I

01:51:44.431 --> 01:51:47.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THINK THAT.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:48.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ANY HUMAN BEING WHO GOES INTO

01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:50.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EDUCATION THEIR HEART IS IN

01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:52.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SERVING KIDS AND SO THE PROBLEM

01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:54.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BECOMES TRULY THE FUNDING

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:56.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
MECHANISM ON HOW WE BEST DO
THAT.

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR

01:51:58.278 --> 01:51:59.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
QUESTION I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AN EASY QUESTION OF SAYING. THAT

01:52:01.414 --> 01:52:03.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF THIS WERE THE SOLE FIX IT

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:05.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
WITH SOLID.

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:06.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
I THINK.

01:52:06.953 --> 01:52:09.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
I'M NOT SURE IF IF.

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:10.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE'RE LOOKING MAYBE OUR SPECIAL

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:12.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN A DIFFERENT MINDSET ALWAYS

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:15.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WONDERED WHY. SPECIAL THAT WAS

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:16.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCLUDED AS PART OF THE EL CAP

01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:17.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
PLAN.

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:20.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
JUST SEEMS LIKE ITSELF YOU KNOW

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:21.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THINK IT SHOULD BE YES.

01:52:21.634 --> 01:52:23.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABSOLUTELY THE FLIP SIDE THE

01:52:23.303 --> 01:52:24.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ARGUMENT IS THAT IF IT WAS

01:52:25.004 --> 01:52:26.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
PARKED.

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:27.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IT WOULD

01:52:27.807 --> 01:52:29.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
BECOME.

01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:30.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LIKE WE HAD WITH THAT CAREER

01:52:30.810 --> 01:52:32.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TECHNICAL EDUCATION WHERE YOU

01:52:32.445 --> 01:52:33.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KNOW IT'S NOT A PRIORITY SOME

01:52:34.013 --> 01:52:34.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISTRICTS ARE JUST PUT IT TO THE

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:36.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BACK BURNER AND THEY YOU KNOW

01:52:36.549 --> 01:52:39.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
USE THAT. BASED ALLOCATION TO

01:52:39.119 --> 01:52:41.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOLKS ON THEIR NEEDS AND AND DO

01:52:41.187 --> 01:52:43.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU THINK THAT YOU WOULD. SPEND

01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:45.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT. ADEQUATE. AMOUNTS TO TAKE

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:47.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
CARE OF SPECIAL AT.

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE FOCUS

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:50.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WILL BE MORE SPECIAL LETTER WE

01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:52.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD HAVE MORE PUBLIC INPUT

01:52:52.298 --> 01:52:53.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PUBLIC STAKE HOLDERS I MEAN.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IS THAT IS OUR OUR PLAN OUR

01:52:55.835 --> 01:52:58.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISTRICT PLAN BUTTON IN IT OUT

01:52:58.104 --> 01:52:59.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF. SPECIAL EDUCATION AWAY FROM

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:01.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE LIMELIGHT YOU TAKE IT AWAY

01:53:01.774 --> 01:53:03.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FROM THE CONVERSATION. AND

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BASICALLY SPECIALIST

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:06.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HISTORICALLY HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:08.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THE BACK BURNER.

01:53:08.681 --> 01:53:11.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IT CONTINUES TO BE THAT WAY

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:13.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BY TAKING OUT OF THE EL CAP. SO

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:14.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION

01:53:14.654 --> 01:53:17.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOWEVER AS A DISTRICT WE PUT SO

01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:19.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MUCH ATTENTION ON EL CAP OVER

01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:21.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE'RE CONFUSING ELF CAPPERS LC

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:22.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AFFECTS THE DO YOU THINK THAT.

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:24.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THE PLAN

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:25.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEATH BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S THE

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:26.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PLAN BUT DO YOU THINK THE IT THE

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:29.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MONEY SHOULD BE. PUT IN WITH LCF

01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:30.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AFTER WE SHOULD STILL HAVE THIS

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:32.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SEPARATE CATEGORICAL ALBEIT

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:34.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MAYBE AN EQUALIZED AMOUNT

01:53:34.274 --> 01:53:36.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CATEGORIC RIGHT. I DO BELIEVE WE

01:53:36.442 --> 01:53:38.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SHOULD BE PART OF THE US IF YOU

01:53:38.444 --> 01:53:40.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
DO THE THE FUNDING.

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:42.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:44.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THANK YOU.

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:46.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT KINDA ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:47.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
IN TERMS OF DISSENT

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DISINCENTIVES FOR HAVING

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:50.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STUDENTS AND LEAST RESTRICTIVE

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENVIRONMENT I WOULD SAY NO? YEAH

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:55.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I WOULD SAY IT'S A TWO FOLD.

01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:56.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YES THERE CAN BE DISINCENTIVES

01:53:56.429 --> 01:53:57.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BECAUSE AS YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:53:57.964 --> 01:53:59.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EARLIER THE KINDS OF SUPPORTS TO

01:53:59.465 --> 01:54:01.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REALLY MAKE STUDENTS THAT HAVE A

01:54:01.267 --> 01:54:03.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SEVERE MORE OF A SEVERE LEVEL OF

01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:05.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISABILITY THAT YOU MAY NEED. IN

01:54:05.171 --> 01:54:07.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ORDER FOR THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:07.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IN THE GENERAL EDUCATION

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:08.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
CLASSROOM.

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:10.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE MAY NOT BE THE FUNDING TO

01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:13.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SUPPORT THAT DISTRICTS.

01:54:13.313 --> 01:54:15.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOLKS WANT KIDS IN THAT GENERAL

01:54:15.548 --> 01:54:17.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EDUCATION CATION CLASSROOM THEY

01:54:17.283 --> 01:54:17.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WANT STUDENTS IN THE LEAST

01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:19.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS

01:54:19.352 --> 01:54:20.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHAT EVERYONE IS SPECIAL

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:22.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EDUCATION REALLY STRIVES FOR.

01:54:22.422 --> 01:54:24.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT AT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS

01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:26.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SOMETHING THAT IS FEASIBLE

01:54:26.292 --> 01:54:27.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DEPENDING UPON THE KINDS OF

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:28.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SUPPORTS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED

01:54:28.995 --> 01:54:30.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH

01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:31.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES. THAT'S

01:54:31.564 --> 01:54:36.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
ANOTHER QUESTION.

01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:38.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS IT. NINETEEN YEARS AGO MY

01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:40.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CLASSROOM WAS MOSTLY MIDDLE

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:41.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCHOOL SIXTH SEVENTH AND EIGHTH

01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:42.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GRADE RESOURCE STUDENTS WITH

01:54:42.141 --> 01:54:43.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEARNING DISABILITIES AND NOW

01:54:43.343 --> 01:54:44.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH THE CHANGES IN FUNDING AND

01:54:45.044 --> 01:54:46.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROGRAM DELIVERIES AND SERVICES

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:47.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AVAILABLE. I HAVE LEARNING

01:54:47.714 --> 01:54:49.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISABILITIES AUTISM EMOTIONALLY

01:54:49.382 --> 01:54:51.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISTURBED COUNSELING AND RICH

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:53.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY

01:54:53.086 --> 01:54:55.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PROGRAMS AVAILABLE STUDY.

01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:56.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT YOU KNOW THE ANALOGY OF

01:54:56.489 --> 01:54:57.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A MOTLEY CREW OF STUDENTS IN MY

01:54:57.991 --> 01:54:59.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ROOM WITH THE DIFFERENT GRADE

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEVELS DIFFERENT ABILITIES HAS

01:55:00.893 --> 01:55:02.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CHANGED BECAUSE OF THAT WITH

01:55:02.595 --> 01:55:09.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
LIMITED RESOURCES.

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:09.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

01:55:09.602 --> 01:55:11.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIR MORE LIVE IN A SMALL PLACE

01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:12.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
YOU THINK RESEARCHER MISS

I AM CURIOUS TO.

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:19.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TEACHERS LIKE MISS CHRIST'S.

01:55:19.379 --> 01:55:20.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DO THEY RECEIVE SPECIAL PAY OR

01:55:20.647 --> 01:55:23.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
DIFFERENTIAL PAY.

01:55:23.616 --> 01:55:25.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:26.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AS A STATE WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:55:26.919 --> 01:55:30.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE MORE.

01:55:30.156 --> 01:55:31.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT WERE IT IS DISTRICT TO

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:33.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DISTRICT.

01:55:33.259 --> 01:55:35.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
I DON'T KNOW THAT IN MY

01:55:35.161 --> 01:55:36.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISTRICT I'VE BEEN THIS IS MY

01:55:36.329 --> 01:55:37.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIRD YEAR AT THE DISTRICT I

01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:38.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T RECALL IF THERE'S ANYTHING

01:55:38.464 --> 01:55:40.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE ARE SPECIALTY AREAS THAT

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:42.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WE PAY HIGHER FOR.

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:45.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN SPEECH AND UP I MEAN SOME

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:47.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POSITIONS ARE SO DIFFICULT TO.

01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:49.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
HIGHER BECAUSE.

01:55:49.809 --> 01:55:51.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OTHER AGENCIES CAN PAY THESE

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:53.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOLKS A LOT MORE MONEY AND SO

01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:55.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S A CHALLENGE AS WELL WE

01:55:55.448 --> 01:55:57.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
DID PUT ADDITIONAL.

01:55:57.216 --> 01:55:59.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESOURCES IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS A

01:55:59.919 --> 01:56:00.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

01:56:02.255 --> 01:56:02.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SPECIAL ED.

01:56:03.056 --> 01:56:05.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND LOOKING AT THE CLASS SIZE

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:05.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TO TRYING TO KEEP THOSE

01:56:06.059 --> 01:56:09.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
MANAGEABLE. AM.

01:56:09.128 --> 01:56:09.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BUT. I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:11.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IMPORTANT THAT ALL TEACHERS GET

01:56:11.264 --> 01:56:13.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SUPPORT.

01:56:13.299 --> 01:56:14.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THAT WERE LOOKING AND THE

01:56:15.001 --> 01:56:16.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FACT THAT ARE GENERALLY TEACHERS

01:56:16.502 --> 01:56:19.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AS WELL SO THEY'RE ABLE TO.

01:56:19.072 --> 01:56:20.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PROVIDE GOOD SUPPORT FOR

01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:21.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THEIR

HERE I AM.

01:56:34.487 --> 01:56:35.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S

01:56:35.555 --> 01:56:36.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT ANOTHER

01:56:36.389 --> 01:56:39.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DEALIO IS A RECOMMENDED THAT

SOUL. IS JUST AN IDEA THAT JUST

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LANGUISHING OUT THERE. I I

01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:44.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
TOURED A.

01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:46.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE PRIVATE SCHOOL JUST AT TWO

01:56:46.332 --> 01:56:48.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
MONTHS AGO.

01:56:48.234 --> 01:56:50.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT SPECIALIZES IN SPECIAL

01:56:50.236 --> 01:56:52.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

01:56:53.039 --> 01:56:55.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OPENER EYE OPENER FOR ME.

01:56:55.108 --> 01:56:56.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEM TO MEET SOME OF THE KIDS

01:56:56.943 --> 01:56:58.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE TEACHERS BUT VERY SMALL

01:56:58.277 --> 01:56:59.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
CLASSROOMS.

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:02.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BUT VERY HIGH TUITION.

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:04.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO THESE INSTRUCTORS ON THE

01:57:04.617 --> 01:57:06.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PRIVATE SIDE. I WOULD THINK ARE

01:57:06.386 --> 01:57:08.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALSO LEAST BEING CONVERTED MAYBE

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:11.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A LITTLE MORE. TO. ONE OF THE

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:13.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REASONS I WAS THERE IS YOU KNOW

01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:14.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TO HELP WITH THEIR GALA.

01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:17.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
TO RAISE MONEY.

01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:19.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO. I JUST THINK YOU'RE MISTER

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:20.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHAIR WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIFFERENTIAL PAY WE OUGHT TO BE

01:57:22.068 --> 01:57:22.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LOOKING AT SOME INCENTIVES TO

01:57:22.668 --> 01:57:24.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
GET.

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:25.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR THESE TEACHERS BECAUSE THIS

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:26.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
AREA IS GROWING.

01:57:26.773 --> 01:57:29.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THE SECOND IS SOME.

01:57:29.409 --> 01:57:32.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MISS A. IF I IF I LOOK CLOSER.

01:57:32.745 --> 01:57:34.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BACK TO JUST A COMMENT ON THE

01:57:34.313 --> 01:57:37.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ISSUE OF OF THE PAY. THE WE AS

01:57:37.517 --> 01:57:40.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AS SMALL DISTRICTS WE VERY OFTEN

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:42.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OFFERED TO PAY FOR SOMEONE

01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:43.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SPECIAL CREDENTIALING OR

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:45.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROGRAMMER TRAINING. BUT THEN

01:57:45.758 --> 01:57:46.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY COME BACK

01:57:46.993 --> 01:57:48.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO OUR SALARY SCHEDULES IN A

01:57:48.528 --> 01:57:50.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISTRICT THAT WE CAN'T COMPETE

01:57:50.329 --> 01:57:52.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITH LARGER DISTRICTS AND SO

01:57:52.131 --> 01:57:53.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAN OUR

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:55.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEARNED AWAY. BY A BETTER SALARY

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:57.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:57:57.437 --> 01:58:00.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CRUCIAL THAT WE DO. EIGHT

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:01.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
INDIVIDUALS FOR THEIR.

01:58:01.174 --> 01:58:03.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHO WHO GOES THROUGH MORE

01:58:03.309 --> 01:58:05.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRAINING THAN SPECIALIZE I MEAN

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:06.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:08.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOVE IT OR THEY WOULDN'T DO IT

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:08.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
BUT AGAIN FOR FROM MY

01:58:09.048 --> 01:58:11.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERSPECTIVE IS YES I WANT TO PAY

01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:12.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEM BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO? AND

01:58:12.952 --> 01:58:14.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHEN I DON'T I KNOW I'M LOSING

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEM SO I'M CONSTANTLY TRAINING

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:18.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THEN THEY LEAVE. THAT'S THE.

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:21.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:21.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
NO NO BUT IT'S GREAT I.

PART OF IT.

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:25.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PART OF THE EDUCATION OF JUST

01:58:25.398 --> 01:58:27.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VISITING THIS CAMPUS. IS THAT

01:58:27.867 --> 01:58:29.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AFTER I'D INTERVIEWS STUDENTS.

JUST A BRIEF BRIEFLY DEFENDANT

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:11.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHY WE WE STILL HAVE SELF AS.

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:12.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE

YOU FOR EXAMPLE.

01:59:14.347 --> 01:59:16.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

OVERSEE FIVE DIFFERENT SELF AS

01:59:28.628 --> 01:59:30.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT THE REASON WHY IS EXAMPLE I

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:33.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GAVE YOU WE HAVE. ONE SELFLESS

FOUR HUNDRED AND. NINETY SIX

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:38.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOLLARS AND ANOTHER WHEN THEY

GET SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX AND

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:42.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY'RE LITERALLY RIGHT BUT UP

01:59:42.108 --> 01:59:44.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AGAINST EACH OTHER. SO.

01:59:44.277 --> 01:59:46.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THE ONE THAT RECEIVED SIX

01:59:46.512 --> 01:59:48.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:50.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT. WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS

01:59:50.850 --> 01:59:51.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT?

01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:53.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEY RECEIVE A LOT OF MONEY

01:59:53.986 --> 01:59:56.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT GOES FOR INFANT FUNDING. SO

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:58.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS THE BENEFIT OF THAT THAT.

01:59:58.224 --> 02:00:00.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT MUTUAL

02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:01.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THOSE FIVE

02:00:01.193 --> 02:00:02.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENT TOPICS IN THOSE TWENTY

02:00:02.495 --> 02:00:03.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIFFERENT DISTRICTS THAT INFANT

02:00:04.063 --> 02:00:05.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FUNDING THAT GOES TO THE

02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:07.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REGIONAL PROGRAM TO OUR COUNTY

02:00:07.199 --> 02:00:09.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
OFFICE AND HELPS TO SUPPORT
THAT.

02:00:09.435 --> 02:00:11.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF THAT WASN'T A RANGE THAT WAY

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:12.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEN THAT MONEY WOULD GO AND

02:00:13.005 --> 02:00:14.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STAY WITH THAT GROUP IN THOSE

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OTHER DISTRICTS THAT DON'T

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:16.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RECEIVE AS MUCH MONEY WOULD NOT

02:00:16.375 --> 02:00:17.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT FOR

02:00:17.843 --> 02:00:20.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT INFANT FUNDING. SO THAT

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:21.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THIGS OF

02:00:21.747 --> 02:00:24.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE REASONS WHY SELF HELP EVEN

02:00:24.083 --> 02:00:25.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OUT THINGS FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE

02:00:25.985 --> 02:00:27.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THREE NINE HUNDRED DISTRICTS

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:30.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
SMALL DISTRICTS WITHIN MYSELF
AS.

02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:30.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:32.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE OF

02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:33.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE

02:00:33.826 --> 02:00:35.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITHIN THAT SOUTH OF THE HELP

02:00:35.728 --> 02:00:37.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL HAPPEN TO BE WITHIN MY ONE

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:39.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF MYSELF AS WHICH IS SOUTH

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:41.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THREE. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

02:00:41.167 --> 02:00:42.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT CAN BE DONE TO SUPPORT

02:00:42.602 --> 02:00:44.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOSE SMALLER DISTRICTS BECAUSE

02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:46.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY SAID FACE SO MANY THE

02:00:46.272 --> 02:00:47.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OBSTACLES THAT MISTER BRAZIL HAS

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THAT HE

02:00:49.642 --> 02:00:51.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FACES AND KEYS. SO THOSE

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:53.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADDITIONAL THOSE FUNDS FROM THE

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:54.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FRIEND THAT SUPPLICANT AND HELP

02:00:55.014 --> 02:00:57.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THOSE IN ADDITION I HAVE TO

02:00:57.817 --> 02:00:59.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SINGLE DISTRICTS UP A SO I KNOW

02:00:59.785 --> 02:01:01.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT THE FUNDING LOOKS LIKE FOR

02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:03.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THOSE FOR SINGLE DISTRICTS UP.

02:01:04.056 --> 02:01:06.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE REASON WHY FOR ONE OF THE

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:08.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAJOR THINGS THAT I SEE IS ONE

02:01:08.361 --> 02:01:10.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF NOT

02:01:10.429 --> 02:01:12.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVING A CELL BUT IS THAT THERE

02:01:12.798 --> 02:01:16.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS IT WHEN A PARENT HAS CONCERNS

02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:18.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN A SINGLE DISTRICTS ALPHA.

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:22.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE'S NO ONE TO GO TO. YOUR

02:01:22.708 --> 02:01:26.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S THAT SELL THE THE ADDRESS

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:27.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT NEED AND WHETHER OR NOT

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:27.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY THEY CAN THEY DO ADDRESS

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:28.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THERE'S NO ONE FOR. ANOTHER

02:01:28.614 --> 02:01:29.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PERSON THEY CAN GO TO ANOTHER

02:01:29.215 --> 02:01:29.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEVEL WHICH WOULD BE ME IN THAT

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:30.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN THAT CASE. SO IN ALL THOSE

02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:31.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CASES I I MEAN NASA IN EXAMPLE

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:31.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RIGHT THERE IT WITH THIS AT THE

02:01:31.784 --> 02:01:32.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOUTH REALLY DOES HELP TO EVEN

02:01:32.451 --> 02:01:36.522 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
OUT AND MAKE A RANGE OUT OF
EXPERTISE.

02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:38.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ITSELF AS DIRECTOR GENERALLY

02:01:38.791 --> 02:01:41.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE A YOU KNOW IS IS A AS IT AS

02:01:41.227 --> 02:01:42.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A PRETTY I DON'T BUY ONE BUT IT

02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:44.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO MY OWN HORN. BUT WE HAVE A

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:45.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
VERY HIGH LEVEL OF EXPERTISE

02:01:45.297 --> 02:01:47.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GENERALLY IN TERMS OF SPECIAL

02:01:47.166 --> 02:01:49.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EDUCATION. SO I MEAN THAT IS

02:01:49.168 --> 02:01:51.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ANOTHER REASON THAT I THAT I

02:01:51.137 --> 02:01:52.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINK IS THE THE SOUTH BUT

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:53.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SHOULD NOT BE.

02:01:53.606 --> 02:01:56.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DONE AWAY WITH AND ALSO BECAUSE.

02:01:56.275 --> 02:01:57.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE

02:01:57.877 --> 02:01:59.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FUNDING MODELS CURRENTLY ARE YOU

02:01:59.912 --> 02:02:00.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT WHEN

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:02.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT SOUTH WHEN THAT REPORT CAME

02:02:02.648 --> 02:02:04.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUT BASICALLY DISTRICTS WERE NOT

02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:05.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADDRESSED. AND I HAVE A NUMBER

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF BASIC EIGHT DISTRICTS AND HOW

02:02:07.119 --> 02:02:08.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FUNNY WOULD LOOK FOR THEM WAS

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:09.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
SOMETHING THAT WAS AN
ADJUSTMENT.

02:02:10.022 --> 02:02:11.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IC REPORT EITHER SO MY BASIC

02:02:11.557 --> 02:02:12.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EIGHT DISTRICTS ARE VERY MUCH

02:02:12.692 --> 02:02:13.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CONCERNED WITH THE PP I SEE

02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:15.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
REPORT CAME OUT THAT THEY

02:02:15.461 --> 02:02:17.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WEREN'T MENTIONED AND WHAT WOULD

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:18.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE HAPPY WITH THEIR FUNDING LOOK

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:20.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LIKE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION.

02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:21.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

DOES. DOES ANYONE AROUND THE

02:02:25.705 --> 02:02:28.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TABLE WANT TO TAKE THE OPPOSITE

02:02:28.274 --> 02:02:29.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POSITION AND MAYBE WE HAVE SOME.

02:02:29.475 --> 02:02:32.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
DEBATE.

02:02:32.278 --> 02:02:34.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
DONNA YOU CHICKENS.

02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:36.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT SO EVERYONE SUPPORTS THE

02:02:36.215 --> 02:02:37.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CELL PRESIDENT IN PP I SEE IS

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:39.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE OUT LIAR OKAY THANK YOU FOR

02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:40.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE DELAY THING I WOULD SAY IS

02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:42.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THERE ARE DIFFERENT.

02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:44.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT EVERY CELL BUT IS THE SAME

02:02:44.757 --> 02:02:46.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO THE LEVEL OF SERVICE IN

02:02:46.358 --> 02:02:47.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE EXPERTISE AND SOME OF THEM

02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DIFFERS GREATLY AND IT DEPENDS

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:51.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ON THE REGION.

02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:53.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT AND SO I'M NOT TAKING I WALK

02:02:53.365 --> 02:02:55.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO SEE MYSELF

02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:56.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

RAISED DURING THE LAST PANEL.

NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND
TODAY.

02:10:41.733 --> 02:10:46.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND HOW WE ENSURE. THAT IF WE'RE

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:46.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS TO THE

02:10:46.838 --> 02:10:48.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SYSTEM.

02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:50.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT CREATES A MORE EQUITABLE

02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:52.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
DISTRIBUTION OF FINDS.

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:54.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT IS A QUESTION YOU MORE MONEY

02:10:54.546 --> 02:10:57.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S. CLEAR. ON THE AWESOME

02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:58.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

02:10:58.784 --> 02:10:59.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DO YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA

02:11:00.052 --> 02:11:01.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIGURE OUT A MORE EQUITABLE WAY

02:11:01.119 --> 02:11:02.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDS WITHIN

02:11:02.521 --> 02:11:04.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE SYSTEM BASED ON. THE NEEDS

02:11:04.456 --> 02:11:06.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUT THERE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE.

02:11:06.091 --> 02:11:07.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T?

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:09.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE MISTAKES THAT LED US TO THE

02:11:09.394 --> 02:11:10.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POLICY CHANGES THAT WE JUST THAT

02:11:10.996 --> 02:11:11.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE MADE BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:13.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EIGHT I LOVE IF SOMEONE COULD

02:11:13.265 --> 02:11:14.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KIND OF DRILL IN A LITTLE BIT

02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:17.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MAYBE. MAYBE YOU JANE. MARIANNE

02:11:17.336 --> 02:11:19.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MARIE I DON'T KNOW I'D.

02:11:19.705 --> 02:11:21.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU'RE BOTH PASSING BACK OF WHAT

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:22.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION BUT

02:11:22.307 --> 02:11:25.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IT BUT. YOU KNOW.

02:11:25.577 --> 02:11:27.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE REASON WHY WE PASSED A BE

02:11:27.346 --> 02:11:28.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SIX OR TWO.

02:11:28.814 --> 02:11:29.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAS IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS OF

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:31.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONCERN OUT THERE THAT THERE WAS

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:32.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A. THERE WERE PURSED PERVERSE

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:34.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
DISINCENTIVES.

02:11:34.853 --> 02:11:36.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I WORRY THAT WE MAY HAVE SWUNG

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:38.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE OTHER END OF THE PIT.

02:11:38.223 --> 02:11:40.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
YOU KNOW PENDULUM.

02:11:40.292 --> 02:11:41.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'M HOW WOULD WE CRAFT A BETTER

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:43.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEM IN TERMS OF EQUITABLE.

02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:45.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES

02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:47.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE.

02:11:47.266 --> 02:11:48.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO REFLECT THE NEEDS THAT ARE

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:50.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
OUT THERE.

02:11:50.602 --> 02:11:52.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK WE NEED A LOT MORE DATA

02:11:52.571 --> 02:11:54.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEFORE I COULD RESPOND TO THAT

02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:56.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
STATEWIDE.

02:11:56.575 --> 02:11:57.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHEN YOU LOOK AT EIGHTY SIX OR

02:11:57.943 --> 02:11:59.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TWO IT'S NOT A LOT SAMMER DINO

02:11:59.911 --> 02:12:01.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
IS A LOW FUNDED.

02:12:01.613 --> 02:12:03.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STRICT IN THE EIGHTY SIX SO TO

02:12:03.782 --> 02:12:05.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
ONE OF THE LOWEST.

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:07.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THERE IS SUCH A HUGE.

02:12:07.786 --> 02:12:10.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISCONNECT IN SUCH A WIDE VERY

02:12:10.188 --> 02:12:11.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ANTS OF THE FUNDING.

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT

02:12:13.058 --> 02:12:16.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PER PUSH PEOPLE IT'S NOT A LOT.

02:12:16.128 --> 02:12:17.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M NOT COMPLAINING BECAUSE WE

02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:18.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
NEED IT.

02:12:18.563 --> 02:12:20.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO I THINK WE NEED TO STUDY YOU

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:23.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KNOW REALLY LOOK AT THE DATA

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:25.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
STATE WIDE. AND LOOK AT.

02:12:25.570 --> 02:12:27.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT DROVE THOSE DECISIONS BACK

02:12:27.239 --> 02:12:29.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THEN WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW

02:12:29.241 --> 02:12:30.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMPARED TO WHAT WE WERE TRYING

02:12:30.409 --> 02:12:32.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO ADDRESS BACK THEN AND I THINK

02:12:32.144 --> 02:12:33.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PART OF IT IS HOW DO YOU

02:12:33.478 --> 02:12:35.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE? WE CAN'T

02:12:35.714 --> 02:12:36.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAIT TWENTY YEARS TO DO THAT WE

02:12:36.915 --> 02:12:39.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WHAT

02:12:39.251 --> 02:12:41.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE DOING. YOU KNOW ON ONGOING

02:12:41.653 --> 02:12:44.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BASIS SO WE CAN MAKE CHANGES AS

02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:45.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NECESSARY SO I KNOW I DIDN'T

02:12:45.791 --> 02:12:48.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REALLY ANSWER THAT EXCEPT TO SAY

02:12:48.493 --> 02:12:49.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK WE NEED TO STUDY IT A

02:12:49.094 --> 02:12:51.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
LITTLE MORE.

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:52.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

02:12:53.065 --> 02:12:54.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I AGREE I THINK WE DO NEED TO

02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:55.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOK AT A LITTLE MORE BUT THERE

02:12:55.734 --> 02:12:57.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE SOME BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL

02:12:57.235 --> 02:12:58.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

OF THOSE THOUSAND STUDENTS. OKAY

02:13:48.286 --> 02:13:50.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND AND AND YOU HAVE.

02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:50.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:13:50.722 --> 02:13:52.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TWENTY SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:54.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS. SO THE FOLLOWING YEAR

02:13:54.559 --> 02:13:57.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LET'S SAY THIS YEAR. I HAVE NINE

02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:58.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
HUNDRED.

02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:01.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TOTAL STUDENTS BUT I HAVE.

02:14:01.733 --> 02:14:03.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TWENTY FIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:14:03.502 --> 02:14:05.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STUDENTS SO NOW I HAVE LESS

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:07.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FUNDING. BECAUSE MY TOTAL

02:14:08.006 --> 02:14:09.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENROLLMENT WENT DOWN BUT I HAVE

02:14:09.908 --> 02:14:11.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AN INCREASED ABOUT A SPECIAL

02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:13.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EDUCATION STUDENTS SO I HAVE

02:14:13.578 --> 02:14:15.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LESS MONEY FOR ME TO WRITE HALF

02:14:15.113 --> 02:14:16.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
JUST PROVIDE SERVICES FOR

02:14:16.281 --> 02:14:17.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS.

02:14:17.582 --> 02:14:19.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S A REAL ISSUE BECAUSE WE

02:14:19.451 --> 02:14:20.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE DECLINING ROLE IN IN A

02:14:20.919 --> 02:14:22.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATEWIDE RIGHT BUT WE HAVE

02:14:22.954 --> 02:14:24.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INCREASING SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:14:24.423 --> 02:14:26.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENROLLMENT. SO SO THE INDIA IS

02:14:27.058 --> 02:14:28.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:29.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BIGGEST THINGS HAT REALLY NEEDS

02:14:29.995 --> 02:14:31.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO BE ADDRESSED THAT AND JUST

02:14:31.630 --> 02:14:32.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW EQUALIZING THE FUNDING

02:14:32.998 --> 02:14:34.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATEWIDE YOU KNOW FOR ALL THE

02:14:34.966 --> 02:14:36.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
DIFFERENT.

02:14:36.067 --> 02:14:37.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT SELFLESS

02:14:37.068 --> 02:14:38.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS IS REALLY YOU KNOW SOMETHING

02:14:38.637 --> 02:14:40.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE.

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:41.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND ALSO WE YOU KNOW WE'VE

02:14:41.673 --> 02:14:43.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE LOOKING

02:14:43.375 --> 02:14:44.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BACKWARD OUT EVEN FUNDED TO WHAT

02:14:45.043 --> 02:14:46.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE ARE FINDING TWO THOUSAND

02:14:46.311 --> 02:14:48.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SEVEN SO THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:49.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT. SO THERE'S THREE THINGS

02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:50.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGHT HERE THAT WE COULD TALK

02:14:50.415 --> 02:14:51.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT IT COULD BE ADDRESSED ALL

02:14:51.983 --> 02:14:53.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING TOTALLY

02:14:53.718 --> 02:14:55.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND I THINK. THAT MESSAGE IS

02:14:55.754 --> 02:14:57.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
REALLY LOUD AND CLEAR.

02:14:57.155 --> 02:14:58.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT TO JUST KIND OF ZERO IN ON

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:00.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THIS.

02:15:01.059 --> 02:15:01.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ISSUE OF THE NINETEEN NINETY

02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:03.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EIGHT REFORMS EIGHTY SIX OR TWO

02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:04.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
ON.

02:15:04.429 --> 02:15:07.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU KNOW I I I THINK I DO WE

02:15:07.265 --> 02:15:08.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABSOLUTELY WOULD LOVE TO CREATE

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:09.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
A SYSTEM THAT WOULD.

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:10.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:15:10.802 --> 02:15:12.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE TRUE

02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:14.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
COSTS.

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:15.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT ARE BORNE BY THE SCHOOLS TO

02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:17.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION

02:15:17.409 --> 02:15:19.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
FOR THESE STUDENTS.

02:15:19.878 --> 02:15:21.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW HOW DO WE AND AND MAYBE

02:15:21.746 --> 02:15:22.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR ME

02:15:22.614 --> 02:15:24.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TODAY BUT IF YOU KNOW. IF YOU

02:15:24.249 --> 02:15:26.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T I LOVE YOU TO GO BACK. TO

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:27.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOUR RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS

CT A CSE. SUPPER ORGANIZATIONS

02:15:33.992 --> 02:15:36.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHATEVER ORGANIZATION MAY BE AND

02:15:36.261 --> 02:15:37.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAY HEY YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HOW

DO WE LEARN.

02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:40.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOW DO WE HOW WE IMPROVE THE

02:15:41.032 --> 02:15:42.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM TO MAKE IT MORE EQUITABLE

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:44.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WHILE?

02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:45.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDERSTANDING AND AVOIDING THE

02:15:46.004 --> 02:15:47.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CHALLENGES THAT LD TO THE

02:15:47.506 --> 02:15:48.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REFORMS IN NINETY EIGHT IN THE

02:15:48.673 --> 02:15:51.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIRST PLACE FROM BEFORE. SO. I I

02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:53.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THINK BEFORE THE WAY IT WAS

02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:54.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORKED WAS BASED UPON THE AMOUNT

02:15:54.379 --> 02:15:55.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF STUDENTS THAT WERE AN STC

02:15:55.647 --> 02:15:57.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CLASSES EVERYONE REALLY IS

02:15:57.482 --> 02:15:58.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PUSHING TOWARDS THE LEAST

02:15:58.383 --> 02:15:59.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT RIGHT

02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:01.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
NOW. SO THE IDEA ISN'T

02:16:01.253 --> 02:16:03.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NECESSARILY THAT WE'RE GOING TO.

02:16:03.288 --> 02:16:04.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE A FORMULA THAT REFLECTS

02:16:04.923 --> 02:16:06.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WEEK STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY

02:16:06.625 --> 02:16:09.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEING FOUND ELIGIBLE FOR AUTISM

02:16:09.194 --> 02:16:09.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR

02:16:09.861 --> 02:16:11.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT AND HERE HE FOUND ELIGIBLE

02:16:11.530 --> 02:16:13.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AT A HIGHER LEVEL. YET THE

02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:15.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
STUDENTS YOU KNOW HAVE ARE

02:16:15.066 --> 02:16:16.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEVERELY IMPACTED NEED A HIGHER

02:16:16.835 --> 02:16:19.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEVEL OF SUPPORT SO KIND OF THAT

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:21.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ARGUMENT TO ME RIGHT NOW.

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:24.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
DOESN'T REALLY A.

02:16:24.075 --> 02:16:24.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT REALLY

02:16:24.809 --> 02:16:26.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOLDING TRUE FOR RIGHT NOW BEGIN

02:16:26.945 --> 02:16:28.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEN WHY WOULDN'T WE YOU KNOW.

02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:29.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FIVE ANALOGY BELOW SOMETHING

02:16:30.048 --> 02:16:31.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ELSE WHERE WE YOU KNOW WHEN

02:16:31.216 --> 02:16:32.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COSTS AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU KNOW

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:34.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENTENCES

02:16:34.185 --> 02:16:35.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT. FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WE

02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:36.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE FINE BECAUSE WE'RE FINDING

02:16:36.888 --> 02:16:37.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT GROUP OF STUDENTS TO BE

02:16:37.489 --> 02:16:39.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ELIGIBLE SAID AND THAT'S

02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:41.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:42.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ANY MORE FUNDING FOR.

02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:44.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

02:16:44.996 --> 02:16:45.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RIGHT IS THAT MAKE DOES THAT

02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:48.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAKE SENSE WHEN I'M SAYING YES

02:16:48.233 --> 02:16:50.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE PROBLEM BEFORE I I GUESS WAS

02:16:50.268 --> 02:16:52.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

02:16:52.571 --> 02:16:54.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I MEAN IF YOU KNOW THE TOTAL

02:16:54.639 --> 02:16:56.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GROSS GENERALIZATION BUT BUT THE

02:16:56.575 --> 02:16:57.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARGUMENTS WHILE THESE DISTRICTS

02:16:57.208 --> 02:16:58.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ARE JUST.

02:16:58.810 --> 02:17:00.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY HAVE SUCH AN INCENTIVE TO

02:17:00.178 --> 02:17:00.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DIAGNOSE EVERYBODY IN THEIR

02:17:00.912 --> 02:17:01.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MOTHER BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING

02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:02.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALL THIS EXTRA MONEY ASSOCIATED

02:17:02.814 --> 02:17:02.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
WITH IT.

02:17:03.048 --> 02:17:04.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:17:04.749 --> 02:17:05.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOW YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE J.

02:17:05.884 --> 02:17:08.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FIFTY GOING INTO THIS ALPHA

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:09.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RIGHT NOW BUT YOU'RE I THOUGHT

02:17:09.087 --> 02:17:11.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE MIDDLE

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:12.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE WHERE IT WAS GETTING RID OF

02:17:12.390 --> 02:17:14.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEM THE ORIGINAL AND THEN GOING

02:17:14.693 --> 02:17:17.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. SO SO.

02:17:17.996 --> 02:17:19.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW I I I THINK THAT'S

02:17:19.831 --> 02:17:20.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO

02:17:20.865 --> 02:17:22.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BE LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF YOU

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:25.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KNOW. NOT JUST THAT BASE AMOUNT

02:17:25.637 --> 02:17:26.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW FOR STUDENT BUT WE

02:17:26.671 --> 02:17:28.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW DO

02:17:28.873 --> 02:17:30.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
WE FIND.

02:17:30.275 --> 02:17:31.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS

02:19:19.918 --> 02:19:21.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY WE

02:19:22.053 --> 02:19:24.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULD KEEP THE FAITH THE SAME

02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:26.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FUNDING MODEL? IN OTHER WORDS

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU'RE CRACKS IS IT DOESN'T MAKE

02:19:27.625 --> 02:19:28.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SENSE IF YOU HAVE A DECLINING

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:31.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENROLLMENT. A SCHOOL A SCHOOL

02:19:31.529 --> 02:19:32.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
LIKE WE HAVE ALL ACROSS

02:19:32.464 --> 02:19:33.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE SHOWING

02:19:33.765 --> 02:19:35.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE IS IT INCREASE IN SPECIAL

02:19:35.734 --> 02:19:37.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ED POPULATION THAT THAT'S THE

02:19:37.335 --> 02:19:40.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POT OF DOLLAR GOING TO SERVE

02:19:40.438 --> 02:19:41.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THESE KIDS GOES DOWN.

02:19:41.506 --> 02:19:42.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SO THEN.

02:19:42.273 --> 02:19:45.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHY WOULDN'T YOU YOU KNOW HAVE

02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:46.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SOME TYPE OF ELSE IF THAT

02:19:46.978 --> 02:19:49.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FUNDING FOR IT AND YOU GIVE THE

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:51.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISTRICT'S MONEY BASED UPON WHO

02:19:51.382 --> 02:19:53.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY SERVE LIKE WE DO WITH? YOU

02:19:53.184 --> 02:19:54.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW THE UNDUE PLACATE ACCOUNT

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:56.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE CAN KEEP THE SAME POLICIES IN

02:19:56.454 --> 02:19:58.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
PLACE.

02:19:58.323 --> 02:20:00.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT FOCUSING ON THE ACTUAL

02:20:00.959 --> 02:20:02.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR

02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:03.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SON FAIRNESS SO WHY WOULDN'T WE

02:20:03.995 --> 02:20:06.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DO THAT IT SEEMS. SO LOGICAL MET

02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:09.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ONE OF MY MISSING HERE.

02:20:09.601 --> 02:20:11.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I THINK WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

02:20:11.369 --> 02:20:13.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SAYING IS A QUICK FIX IS AT

02:20:13.872 --> 02:20:16.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
LEAST FUND.

02:20:16.207 --> 02:20:17.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHEN WE HAVE AN INCREASE IN

02:20:17.342 --> 02:20:19.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SPECIAL ED AND A DECREASE IN

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:21.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ROME AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO

02:20:21.212 --> 02:20:22.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GET THAT EIGHTY SIX SO TO

02:20:22.380 --> 02:20:24.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FUNDING AND LIKE IT A LOT WHAT

02:20:24.749 --> 02:20:26.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
WHAT WHAT WE JUST GO ALL THE
WAY.

02:20:26.251 --> 02:20:29.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BY WOULDN'T YOU JUST FIND NOT

02:20:29.087 --> 02:20:30.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BASED UPON HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU

02:20:30.121 --> 02:20:31.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE IN THE DISTRICT BUT HOW

02:20:31.723 --> 02:20:33.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MANY STUDENTS YOU HAVE. IN IN

02:20:33.391 --> 02:20:35.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THIS. DISABILITY BUT THIS

02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:36.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POPULATION IN THE I THINK THAT

02:20:37.061 --> 02:20:39.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF YOU START FROM SCRATCH IF WE

02:20:39.197 --> 02:20:40.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAD. STARTED BUILDING OUR SYSTEM

02:20:40.632 --> 02:20:42.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RIGHT HERE ON THIS TABLE I WOULD

02:20:42.233 --> 02:20:44.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK YOU WOULD DO IT THAT WAY

02:20:44.102 --> 02:20:46.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RATHER THAN THIS. BACKWARDS WAY

02:20:46.137 --> 02:20:48.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO WHAT'S A COUPLE WHAT WHY ARE

02:20:48.106 --> 02:20:50.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE MIGHT MAYBE THIS IS LA ON

02:20:50.175 --> 02:20:52.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FINANCE QUESTION FOR OUR. BUDGET

02:20:52.076 --> 02:20:54.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HEARING BUT WHY ARE WE DOING

02:20:54.345 --> 02:20:54.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

02:20:54.879 --> 02:20:55.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WELL I THINK.

02:20:55.547 --> 02:20:57.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF WE LOOK AT THE TRUE COST OF

02:20:57.515 --> 02:21:00.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SPECIAL ED THAT'S THAT'S BIG.

02:21:00.618 --> 02:21:01.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO WE CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE

02:21:01.986 --> 02:21:03.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOSE ASPIRATIONAL GOALS TO FUND

02:21:03.855 --> 02:21:05.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE TRUE COST OF ALL OF THE

02:21:05.456 --> 02:21:07.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISABILITIES AND HOW THOSE.

02:21:07.258 --> 02:21:09.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONTINUE TO RISE EACH YEAR BUT

02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:11.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FINDING A FUNDING SOURCE THAT

02:21:11.296 --> 02:21:15.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ADDRESSES THE MORE. EXPENSIVE OR

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:17.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
MORE CHALLENGING MORE.

02:21:17.135 --> 02:21:19.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STAFF INTENSE DISABILITIES AT A

02:21:19.938 --> 02:21:21.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HIGHER LEVEL MEAN I THINK WE'RE

02:21:21.472 --> 02:21:23.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OPEN TO.

02:21:23.541 --> 02:21:25.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE FUNDING TO HELP OUR KIDS.

02:21:25.977 --> 02:21:27.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WHATEVER THAT TAKES BUT AM I

02:21:27.512 --> 02:21:29.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DO THINK WE NEED A LITTLE MORE

02:21:29.647 --> 02:21:31.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WORK ON PROVIDING. WHAT DOES

02:21:31.182 --> 02:21:32.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT?

02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:34.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ASPIRATIONAL FUNDING MODEL LOOK

02:21:34.319 --> 02:21:37.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
LIKE.

02:21:37.188 --> 02:21:38.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE DISSENTING OPINION THE ROOF

02:21:38.857 --> 02:21:40.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FELT LIKE IT SHOULD BE NOW SEE A

02:21:40.458 --> 02:21:42.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FAT BUT I MEAN I AGREE SIX OF

02:21:42.126 --> 02:21:45.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWO MAY HAVE. POSITION HOWEVER.

02:21:45.296 --> 02:21:46.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AGAIN SPECIAL HAS TO BE PART OF

02:21:46.965 --> 02:21:49.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE MAINSTREAM AND I WOULD LOOK

02:21:49.167 --> 02:21:51.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AT THE FUNDING FORMULA DIFFERENT

02:21:51.202 --> 02:21:52.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW BE LOOKING AT UNDER PUT

02:21:52.937 --> 02:21:54.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ON DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS. WITH

02:21:54.205 --> 02:21:55.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SPECIAL ED.

02:21:55.173 --> 02:21:57.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
I WOULD.

02:21:57.175 --> 02:21:59.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT THAT AS A DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS

02:21:59.077 --> 02:22:02.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO IT IS. ETERNAL LOOK AT THAT

02:22:02.146 --> 02:22:03.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THOSE NUMBERS EVEN YOU HAVE

02:22:03.982 --> 02:22:05.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENGLISH LEARNERS THEY'RE STILL

02:22:05.683 --> 02:22:07.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY WILL RECEIVE AN EXTRA

02:22:07.485 --> 02:22:09.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AMOUNT SO JUST LOOKING AT. THAT

02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:11.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FORMULA DIFFERENTLY UNDER THE

02:22:11.689 --> 02:22:13.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LENS OF SPECIAL LET ME BE

02:22:13.224 --> 02:22:15.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT. BECAUSE

02:22:15.159 --> 02:22:16.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU REALLY I I TRULY BELIEVE IT

02:22:16.761 --> 02:22:18.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NEEDS TO BE INTEGRATED WITHIN

02:22:18.696 --> 02:22:21.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE WHOLE. INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM

02:22:21.165 --> 02:22:22.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH UP TO THIS BUT THERE'S TWO

HAVE IN YOUR DISTRICTS AND. BUT

02:22:50.261 --> 02:22:52.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

MADE COMMENTS.

02:23:31.636 --> 02:23:32.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE ALREADY HEARD IT HERE IN

02:23:32.737 --> 02:23:33.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS HEARING AT HER SCENE IN

02:23:34.038 --> 02:23:34.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%

SPONSOR TO TO TO TO THAT

02:23:43.214 --> 02:23:45.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONCERNED IT SEEMS TO BE RES

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:50.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
FREQUENTLY.

02:23:50.688 --> 02:23:52.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I DON'T SEE FUNDING OF A

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:55.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISABILITY. AS AN INCENTIVE TO

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:58.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
KEEP A CHILD IN SPECIAL

02:23:58.096 --> 02:23:58.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
EDUCATION.

02:23:59.030 --> 02:24:01.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EDUCATORS ARE HERE TO ENSURE

02:24:01.666 --> 02:24:03.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL

02:24:03.668 --> 02:24:04.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE

02:24:04.335 --> 02:24:06.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ENVIRONMENT. NOW THAT MAY BE

02:24:06.237 --> 02:24:09.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MORE INTENSIVE CARE AT FIRST AS

02:24:09.207 --> 02:24:10.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
WE BEGAN TO.

02:24:10.675 --> 02:24:13.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRANSITION THEM INTO A LEAST

02:24:13.478 --> 02:24:15.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT.

02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:17.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANY BUSINESS

02:24:18.049 --> 02:24:20.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OR SUPERINTENDENT OR EDUCATOR.

02:24:21.052 --> 02:24:23.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT LOOKS TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:28.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO THEY CAN GET MORE MONEY.

02:24:28.793 --> 02:24:30.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I'VE SEEN AN INCREASED AND

02:24:30.528 --> 02:24:32.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DIVERSIONS TO SPECIAL ACT

THROUGH THE MTS LASTS ROLLOUT

02:24:34.399 --> 02:24:35.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AND THE. RESPONSE TO

02:24:36.034 --> 02:24:38.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INTERVENTION SIR IN SOME WAYS

02:24:38.102 --> 02:24:39.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OFFSETTING STUDENTS FROM GETTING

02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:41.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SERVICES THEY NEED. BUT NOT

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:44.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE OF HER IDENTIFYING AND

02:24:44.275 --> 02:24:48.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PAYING FOR THE SERVICES.

02:24:48.379 --> 02:24:52.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANYONE ELSE WITH HER THOUGHTS.

02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:54.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WELL BEING A MOTHER YOU KNOW MY

02:24:54.252 --> 02:24:56.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SON WAS A GIVEN OUT ELECTRONIC

02:24:56.187 --> 02:24:58.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
DEVICE. BECAUSE.

02:24:58.423 --> 02:25:00.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HE IS LEARNING BUT WE DON'T

02:25:00.358 --> 02:25:01.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW HOW MUCH HE'S LEARNING IN

02:25:01.793 --> 02:25:04.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THE CLASSROOM. AND.

02:25:04.295 --> 02:25:05.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:25:05.463 --> 02:25:06.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:07.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRANSITION OF MAYBE GETTING A

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:09.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ONE ONE EIGHH WHICH OF THE

02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:11.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISTRICT IS NOT REALLY WANTING

02:25:11.135 --> 02:25:13.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO. GIVE ORDER BECAUSE THEY

02:25:13.304 --> 02:25:14.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING. AND IT

02:25:15.039 --> 02:25:16.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WILL REQUIRE HE'S MAINSTREAM

02:25:16.908 --> 02:25:18.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIRTEEN UM AT LEAST TWO HOURS

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:20.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OF THE DAY. SO HE GOES TO

02:25:20.511 --> 02:25:22.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SPECIAL ED CLASSROOM AND THEN

02:25:22.213 --> 02:25:23.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
GOING TO MAINSTREAM.

02:25:23.514 --> 02:25:23.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

02:25:23.681 --> 02:25:26.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:25:26.184 --> 02:25:28.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO THAT COMES AGAIN TO DO THIS.

02:25:28.586 --> 02:25:29.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BASICALLY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN

02:25:29.654 --> 02:25:31.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISCUSSING ABOUT THE FINDING AND

02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:33.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
I'M.

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:35.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVING THE ABILITY TO MAYBE.

02:25:35.726 --> 02:25:37.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS A LIBERATING THEM. LEARNING

02:25:37.428 --> 02:25:38.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
FOR THE STUDENT.

02:25:38.329 --> 02:25:42.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
FROM.

02:25:42.667 --> 02:25:44.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I I THINK THAT THE INCENTIVE

02:25:44.635 --> 02:25:45.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS SIMPLY NOT THERE IN IN THE

02:25:45.903 --> 02:25:48.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SENSE THAT THE IT PETER RACKS

02:25:48.139 --> 02:25:50.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IT WANTS. GOALS TO BE MET

02:25:50.241 --> 02:25:51.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND GROWTH TO BE MADE. OUR OWN

02:25:51.876 --> 02:25:54.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DASHBOARD SAYS THAT WE NEED TO

02:25:54.112 --> 02:25:55.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MAKE A SO THAT THERE IS

02:25:55.113 --> 02:25:56.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABSOLUTELY ZERO INCENTIVE FOR

02:25:56.514 --> 02:25:58.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
KEEPING A CHILD.

02:25:58.249 --> 02:26:01.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT A POOR LEVEL OF FUNCTIONING.

02:26:01.219 --> 02:26:02.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BE IT ACADEMICALLY SOCIALLY AT

02:26:02.887 --> 02:26:05.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ANY LEVEL SO I I DON'T THINK

02:26:05.089 --> 02:26:06.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THAT THAT'S THE.

02:26:06.424 --> 02:26:07.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A DAY I

02:26:07.458 --> 02:26:08.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT THERE

02:26:08.459 --> 02:26:10.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IS A DISTRICT OR.

02:26:10.394 --> 02:26:12.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND EDUCATOR. TAKING ADVANTAGE

02:26:12.396 --> 02:26:14.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:26:14.365 --> 02:26:15.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK WE'RE MORE PROFESSIONAL

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:17.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THAN THAT.

02:26:17.835 --> 02:26:19.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

02:26:25.109 --> 02:26:26.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SIMPLY AN EXCUSE TO PREVENT.

WHICH WERE VERY CLEARLY

02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:41.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INDICATED FROM TODAY THAT

02:28:41.345 --> 02:28:43.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE. JUST

02:28:43.247 --> 02:28:45.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
JUST TO HELP CLARIFY SOME
THINGS.

02:28:45.883 --> 02:28:47.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO I WAS ABLE TO BE PART OF THE

02:28:48.019 --> 02:28:50.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AB SIX OH TWO CONVERSATIONS AND

02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:51.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I THOUGHT A LITTLE BIT OF

02:28:51.322 --> 02:28:53.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HISTORY. GOING INTO THIS US

02:28:53.758 --> 02:28:57.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPECIAL ED FINANCE WOULD HELP.

02:28:57.161 --> 02:28:58.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN AB

02:28:58.929 --> 02:29:01.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIX OH TWO WAS WRITTEN. IT WAS

02:29:01.265 --> 02:29:04.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TOO ADDI INCENTIVIZE THE THE

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:06.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PAST AND IT WAS TO EQUALIZE THE

02:29:06.837 --> 02:29:08.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENCES SO YOU'VE HEARD SOME

02:29:08.272 --> 02:29:10.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:11.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DISTRICTS WERE FUNDED SO

02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:12.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENTLY AND IT WAS ACTUALLY.

02:29:12.977 --> 02:29:14.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNITS OF FUNDING TEACHERS AND

02:29:14.945 --> 02:29:17.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AIDES DEPENDING ON HOW IT IS

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:18.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT YOU DID WHAT YOU DID. AND

02:29:18.949 --> 02:29:20.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT YOUR SUPPORT SERVICE RATIO

02:29:20.618 --> 02:29:21.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WAS IT WAS A VERY COMPLEX

02:29:21.752 --> 02:29:23.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
FORMULA AND IT DIFFERED

02:29:23.988 --> 02:29:25.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IT

02:29:25.222 --> 02:29:27.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAME SO UNEQUAL THAT DISTRICTS

02:29:27.925 --> 02:29:29.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST LIKE YOU'VE HEARD TODAY

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:30.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WERE TELLING THE LEGISLATURE.

02:29:31.028 --> 02:29:32.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THIS ISN'T FAIR THIS IS A

02:29:32.229 --> 02:29:34.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REASONABLE WE NEED TO CHANGE IT.

02:29:34.532 --> 02:29:36.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SO THERE WAS A VERY LONG

02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:38.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONVOLUTED CONVERSATION TO TRY

02:29:38.169 --> 02:29:39.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE A

02:29:39.937 --> 02:29:41.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOOD WAY TO DO THIS. SO WE DID

02:29:41.939 --> 02:29:44.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LOOK AT D. INCENTIVIZING.

02:29:44.642 --> 02:29:46.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THE ISSUE WAS THAT IF WE

02:29:46.344 --> 02:29:48.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WENT TO AN EIGHTY EIGHT BASED

02:29:48.179 --> 02:29:50.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MODEL THEN ALL OF THOSE

02:29:50.614 --> 02:29:52.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE STATE.

02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:55.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COULD BE KIND OF AVERAGED OUT.

02:29:55.886 --> 02:29:57.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT YOU STILL HAD TO DO YOUR

02:29:57.722 --> 02:29:58.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AVERAGING FROM THIS UNEQUAL

02:29:58.322 --> 02:30:00.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
POINT.

02:30:00.224 --> 02:30:03.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO THE IDEA OF. COMING TO AN

02:30:03.861 --> 02:30:06.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EIGHTY A BASIS BUT OVER TIME

02:30:06.997 --> 02:30:09.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EQUALIZING THOSE RATES UP WAS

02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:11.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SOLUTION AT THE TIME AND SO

02:30:11.936 --> 02:30:12.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEE THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE STILL

02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:14.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEVER GOTTEN THERE. AND THAT'S

02:30:14.905 --> 02:30:17.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHY EQUALIZATION WAS MENTIONED

02:30:17.375 --> 02:30:19.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BY SO MANY PEOPLE NOW BECAUSE IF

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:20.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MY EIGHTY YEAR RATE IS FOUR

02:30:20.611 --> 02:30:22.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS IN

02:30:22.413 --> 02:30:25.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEARS IS SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS.

02:30:25.116 --> 02:30:26.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IT'S NOT FAIR SO THE

02:30:26.817 --> 02:30:27.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EQUALIZATION ISSUE IS JUST

02:30:27.651 --> 02:30:29.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE MOST

02:30:29.153 --> 02:30:31.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
CRITICAL ARM. ISSUES OF

02:30:31.155 --> 02:30:32.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CONTINUATION.

02:30:32.623 --> 02:30:34.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT THE OTHER WAS THAT WE DID GO

02:30:34.358 --> 02:30:36.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO A K. TWELVE EIGHTY A MODEL

02:30:36.994 --> 02:30:38.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WE'RE RESPONSIBLE IN SPECIAL

02:30:38.729 --> 02:30:41.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ED FROM BIRTH. TO TWENTY TWO SO

02:30:41.766 --> 02:30:43.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO DON'T GET A

02:30:43.067 --> 02:30:44.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGULAR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WHO

02:30:44.535 --> 02:30:46.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NEED TRANSITION SERVICES WHO

02:30:46.303 --> 02:30:48.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NEED SERVICES. TO BECOME THE

02:30:48.305 --> 02:30:49.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MOST PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS THEY

02:30:49.874 --> 02:30:51.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
CAN BE AND WE HAVE THIS

02:30:51.776 --> 02:30:54.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BURGEONING PRESCHOOL POPULATION

02:30:54.512 --> 02:30:57.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT HAS JUST EXPLODED ACROSS.

02:30:57.281 --> 02:30:59.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE STATE AND SO OUT OF OUR K.

02:30:59.617 --> 02:31:00.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TWELVE EIGHTY A WERE SUPPOSED TO

02:31:00.885 --> 02:31:03.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE COVERING THIS ENTIRE RANGE OF

02:31:03.254 --> 02:31:05.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SERVICES.

02:31:05.156 --> 02:31:06.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE

02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:07.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARTICULAR POINTS THAT HERE WE

02:31:07.792 --> 02:31:09.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE THESE HUGE INCREASES IN IN

02:31:09.794 --> 02:31:11.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
US STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES.

02:31:11.762 --> 02:31:13.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND REALLY THE ISSUE THAT IS

02:31:13.397 --> 02:31:16.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MOST UNREASONABLE ABOUT EIGHTY

02:31:16.066 --> 02:31:18.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SIX SO TOO IS THAT IT IS ONLY

02:31:18.169 --> 02:31:19.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KATE TWELVE DOESN'T INCLUDE

02:31:19.370 --> 02:31:20.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PRESCHOOL DOESN'T INCLUDE

02:31:20.604 --> 02:31:22.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
TRANSITION AGE.

02:31:22.273 --> 02:31:25.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND IT IS STILL UNEQUAL IN IT

02:31:25.342 --> 02:31:26.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SARAH IN ITS RATES ACROSS THE

02:31:26.377 --> 02:31:28.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DISTRICT.

02:31:28.245 --> 02:31:30.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THE THE SHEEP THAT WE HAVE

02:31:30.781 --> 02:31:33.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDED FOR YOU. ACTUALLY TWO

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:35.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:35.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE PROCESS OF REVAMPING THE

SPECIAL ED CREDENTIAL. WE DO

02:32:37.581 --> 02:32:40.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE MORE M. TSS ACROSS THE

HEALTH MODELS. OF MEN THAT WERE

02:32:43.287 --> 02:32:45.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RECOMMENDED FROM OUR BEST

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:45.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PRACTICES A LOT OF THE

02:32:45.689 --> 02:32:48.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
ASSESSMENT ACCOUNTABILITY
PIECES.

02:32:48.759 --> 02:32:51.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

02:32:51.362 --> 02:32:53.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT

02:32:54.064 --> 02:32:55.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SINCE THAT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

02:32:55.499 --> 02:32:59.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUDGET CUT. DONE AUGHT ANYTHING

02:32:59.136 --> 02:33:00.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF SIGNIFICANCE IN THE AREA OF

02:33:00.905 --> 02:33:03.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPECIAL ED FUNDING. AND I NEED

02:33:03.073 --> 02:33:05.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO AY THAT WHEN MY CURSED ASKED

02:33:05.509 --> 02:33:07.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
US TO START THIS PROCESS WHICH

02:33:07.177 --> 02:33:09.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
IS NOW.

02:33:09.513 --> 02:33:12.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SIX YEARS AGO HE SAID WE ARE

02:33:12.383 --> 02:33:14.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST BEGINNING L. CFF WE ARE

02:33:14.552 --> 02:33:16.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
JUST BEGINNING EL CAP.

02:33:16.086 --> 02:33:18.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DON'T MESS WITH SPECIAL ED

02:33:18.689 --> 02:33:22.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FUNDING IN THE EL CAP YET.

02:33:22.192 --> 02:33:23.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THAT CAME

02:33:23.694 --> 02:33:24.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM SO WE LOOKED AT THE WHOLE

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:26.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PICTURE ABOUT WELL WHAT IS

02:33:26.163 --> 02:33:27.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPECIAL AND FINDING WHAT CAN WE

02:33:27.298 --> 02:33:28.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
RECOMMEND.

02:33:28.632 --> 02:33:30.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO THE LEGISLATURE SO WE HAVE

02:33:30.401 --> 02:33:34.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS WHOLE LIST. OF IDEAS. AND.

02:33:35.005 --> 02:33:36.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I WISH THAT SOMEONE MCCARTY

02:33:36.507 --> 02:33:38.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WERE STILL HERE BECAUSE IF YOU

02:33:38.542 --> 02:33:39.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LOOK AT THAT EIGHTY A RATE.

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:42.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REALLY THE IDEA OF LCF I WAS

02:33:42.479 --> 02:33:44.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT EVERYBODY GETS AN EIGHTY A

02:33:44.248 --> 02:33:45.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RATE. AND SO OUR WHOLE POINT IS

02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:47.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT ARE ADA RATES IN SPECIAL ED

02:33:47.818 --> 02:33:50.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE UNEQUAL. IF YOU WERE TO DO

02:33:50.321 --> 02:33:52.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ANY KIND OF MODEL THAT SAYS

02:33:52.356 --> 02:33:54.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LET'S EQUALIZE THAT'S WHERE THE

02:33:54.224 --> 02:33:56.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIXES. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT IT

02:33:56.627 --> 02:33:57.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO

02:33:57.962 --> 02:34:00.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROTECT SPECIAL ED FUNDING AS

02:34:00.130 --> 02:34:01.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SPECIAL ED FUNDING IT'S AN

02:34:01.131 --> 02:34:04.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENTITLEMENT. FROM FEDERAL LAW IT

02:34:04.068 --> 02:34:06.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS THAT WHICH GUARANTEES THAT WE

02:34:06.503 --> 02:34:08.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO OUR

02:34:08.205 --> 02:34:11.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDENTS. AND SO I THINK THAT IS

02:34:11.275 --> 02:34:12.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE THE BIGGEST SOLUTION AND YOU

02:34:12.610 --> 02:34:14.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WILL SEE. IN OUR LIST OF

02:34:14.178 --> 02:34:16.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WAS NUMBER

02:34:16.213 --> 02:34:16.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ONE.

02:34:17.047 --> 02:34:18.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT WAS NUMBER ONE THREE YEARS

02:34:18.949 --> 02:34:20.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AGO IT'S NUMBER ONE. TODAY

02:34:20.517 --> 02:34:22.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST

02:34:22.252 --> 02:34:23.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CRITICAL AND IT'S BECAUSE OF

02:34:24.054 --> 02:34:24.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE ALREADY

INTO.

02:34:27.358 --> 02:34:30.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE DIFFERENCES IN RATES

02:34:30.194 --> 02:34:32.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGAIN. OUT BUT THE SECOND ONE IS

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:33.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THE STUDENTS HAVE INCREASED AND

02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:49.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE ISN'T. ANYWHERE NEAR THE

02:34:49.446 --> 02:34:51.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADEQUATE FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE

02:35:00.557 --> 02:35:02.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

I WILL SAY THAT OUR

02:36:30.714 --> 02:36:32.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

UPDATING ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS

CONTINUING. TO BE IMPROVED.

02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:46.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS LOW INCIDENCE FUNDING WAS

02:36:46.964 --> 02:36:48.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MENTIONED EARLIER AND AND OUR

02:36:48.265 --> 02:36:50.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SEVENTH RECOMMENDATION WAS ABOUT

02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:52.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCREASING THAT BUT CHANGING THE

02:36:52.302 --> 02:36:54.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

MORE STUDENTS. WHO WOULD THEN BE

02:37:00.177 --> 02:37:01.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ELIGIBLE FOR THE FUNDING BUT

02:37:01.812 --> 02:37:03.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU'VE ALSO HEARD HOW INADEQUATE

02:37:03.714 --> 02:37:05.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT LEVEL OF FUNDING AT LESS

EXPENSIVE PARTICULARLY IN A

02:38:10.914 --> 02:38:12.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RESPONSE THAT OUR LEGISLATURE

02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:14.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAS GIVEN US AT ABOUT FIFTEEN

02:38:14.451 --> 02:38:15.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EACH CELL BY

PARENTS.

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:22.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND THEN WE HAVE SEVERAL

02:38:22.693 --> 02:38:24.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIFFERENT A COUPLE DIFFERENT

02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:25.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IDEAS HERE ABOUT FACILITIES

BIRTH ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY TWO.

02:38:31.301 --> 02:38:31.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND THEN THERE ARE THREE

02:38:32.035 --> 02:38:34.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE FEDERAL

02:38:34.304 --> 02:38:36.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEVEL AND TO THE OF THIS ISSUE

02:38:36.607 --> 02:38:39.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF FORTY PERCENT IS IS ONE THAT

02:38:39.443 --> 02:38:40.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OUR LEGISLATURE HERE IN

02:38:41.044 --> 02:38:42.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CALIFORNIA HAS FREQUENTLY

02:38:42.779 --> 02:38:43.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ACTUALLY ADOPTED A JOINT

02:38:43.914 --> 02:38:46.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RESOLUTION. THAT HAS GONE TO

02:38:46.316 --> 02:38:48.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONGRESS TO SAY. IT SURE WOULD

02:38:48.085 --> 02:38:50.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HELP IF YOU WOULD COME THROUGH

02:38:50.387 --> 02:38:51.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WITH WHAT YOU SAID IN THE

02:38:51.755 --> 02:38:53.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ORIGINAL ID A. THERE HAVE BEEN

02:38:53.857 --> 02:38:55.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BILLS PASSED AND BROUGHT FORWARD

02:38:55.726 --> 02:38:58.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVERY YEAR THAT SAY PLEASE GET

02:38:58.462 --> 02:39:00.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT FUNDING TO FORTY PERCENT IT

02:39:00.130 --> 02:39:01.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE TO

02:39:01.632 --> 02:39:03.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVERY STATE BUT PARTICULARLY TO

02:39:03.166 --> 02:39:05.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
CALIFORNIA. AND.

02:39:05.302 --> 02:39:06.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:39:06.270 --> 02:39:07.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE

02:39:08.005 --> 02:39:10.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COULD DO IT IS UP TO CONGRESS.

02:39:10.073 --> 02:39:12.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT AT LEAST THIS LEGISLATURE

02:39:12.175 --> 02:39:13.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
COULD CONSIDER ADOPTING A

02:39:13.477 --> 02:39:16.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESOLUTION. AND THEN AS YOU HAD

02:39:17.014 --> 02:39:18.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MENTIONED SENATOR PAT ANOTHER OF

02:39:18.548 --> 02:39:20.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS ABOUT.

02:39:20.651 --> 02:39:22.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GETTING RID OF THOSE BARRIERS TO

02:39:22.152 --> 02:39:26.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MEDICAL AND I ELLIE A. FANS.

02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:28.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THEN THERE'S ONE OUT ONE

02:39:28.158 --> 02:39:29.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LAST ONE ABOUT ENSURING THAT ALL

02:39:29.826 --> 02:39:30.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
OF OUR STUDENTS WITH

02:39:30.294 --> 02:39:32.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISABILITIES STILL HAVE THE

02:39:32.195 --> 02:39:33.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
RIGHTS TO.

02:39:33.864 --> 02:39:34.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
FEDERAL SCHOLARSHIP

02:39:34.431 --> 02:39:36.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPPORTUNITIES AND AND THAT WAS

02:39:36.566 --> 02:39:39.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHANGED FOR. AN UNREASONABLE.

02:39:39.369 --> 02:39:41.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
A CHANGE IN THE PAST.

02:39:41.305 --> 02:39:43.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO I DID THAT AS QUICKLY AS I

02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:44.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COULD WANTING TO SAY SO MUCH

02:39:44.574 --> 02:39:46.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MOREAND BECKY HAS SENT MORE TO

HIGHLIGHT AND REITERATE. THE

02:41:18.802 --> 02:41:20.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EARLY EDUCATION PIECE AND SO IF

02:41:20.737 --> 02:41:22.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE WAS ONE THING IF THE MAGIC

02:41:22.706 --> 02:41:24.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAND HAPPEN IF THERE WAS ONE

02:41:24.274 --> 02:41:26.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THING THAT REALLY. WE BELIEVE

02:41:26.076 --> 02:41:27.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY FOR

02:41:27.444 --> 02:41:28.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUR STUDENTS IT WOULD BE THE

02:41:28.879 --> 02:41:31.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ACCESS TO EARLY PRESCHOOL

02:41:31.081 --> 02:41:32.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INCLUSIVE SETTINGS AND IT'S NOT

02:41:32.983 --> 02:41:34.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
JUST BECAUSE WE WANT KIDS HAVING

02:41:34.985 --> 02:41:35.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ACCESS TO EARLY PRESCHOOL

02:41:35.519 --> 02:41:38.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE WE DO. IT'S ALSO BECAUSE

02:41:38.255 --> 02:41:40.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF WHAT HAPPENS AS A COMMUNITY.

02:41:40.290 --> 02:41:42.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN TERMS OF SETTING A CULTURE

02:41:42.893 --> 02:41:44.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT EVERYONE BELONGS IN OUR

02:41:44.194 --> 02:41:46.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM AND WHAT WE SEE NOW IS WE

02:41:46.463 --> 02:41:48.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO START

02:41:48.098 --> 02:41:49.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OFF IN SEGREGATED PRESCHOOL

02:41:49.466 --> 02:41:51.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SETTINGS AND THEY NEVER LEAVE.

02:41:52.002 --> 02:41:53.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND SO THERE WAS A QUESTION

02:41:53.236 --> 02:41:54.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EARLIER ABOUT NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS

02:41:55.038 --> 02:41:55.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WERE SERVING ABOUT.

02:41:56.039 --> 02:41:57.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUT OF OUR SEVEN HUNDRED AND

02:41:57.774 --> 02:41:58.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS

02:41:58.909 --> 02:42:00.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA

02:42:00.811 --> 02:42:01.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM

02:42:01.745 --> 02:42:04.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE SERVED IN NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS

02:42:04.181 --> 02:42:05.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'M TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX.

02:42:05.949 --> 02:42:07.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHICH SHOULD

02:42:07.884 --> 02:42:09.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BE DELINEATED FROM OR DIFFERENT

02:42:09.986 --> 02:42:11.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU DID FROM PRIVATE SCHOOLS. OF

02:42:11.788 --> 02:42:12.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE SCHOOLS

02:42:12.756 --> 02:42:14.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT ARE CERTIFIED THROUGH THE

02:42:14.458 --> 02:42:16.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STATE TO SERVE STUDENTS WITH

02:42:16.893 --> 02:42:19.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISABILITIES AND THEY DO RECEIVE

02:42:19.696 --> 02:42:21.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ID A FUNDS THROUGH THEIR SELF OR

02:42:21.264 --> 02:42:23.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ELLIJAY. AND PUBLIC PRIVATE

02:42:23.767 --> 02:42:26.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCHOOLS ARE NOT SCHOOLS THAT WE

02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:28.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CERTIFY IN THAT REGARD AND THEY

02:42:28.271 --> 02:42:30.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DO NOT RECEIVE PUBLIC FUNDING.

02:42:30.273 --> 02:42:31.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
AND SO.

02:42:31.208 --> 02:42:32.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:42:32.642 --> 02:42:34.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO IN TERMS OF IF WE'RE LOOKING

02:42:34.811 --> 02:42:36.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AT WHAT THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR

02:42:36.413 --> 02:42:38.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUCK IS IT'S REALLY ENSURING

02:42:38.315 --> 02:42:39.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT WE HAVE THOSE EARLY PRE

02:42:39.683 --> 02:42:41.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
SCHOOL SETTINGS NOT ONLY ARE
YOU.

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:43.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHANGING THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF

02:42:43.086 --> 02:42:44.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE CHILDREN THAT STARTED IN THE

02:42:44.254 --> 02:42:46.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SETTINGS BUT I WOULD BE REMISS

02:42:46.356 --> 02:42:47.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF I DID NOT QUOTE MY FRIEND

02:42:47.624 --> 02:42:49.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JOKE SAVIOR WHO'S THE DIRECTOR

02:42:49.493 --> 02:42:51.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF THE PROBLEM OF REHAB.

02:42:51.161 --> 02:42:52.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHO SAYS THAT THE BUSINESS

02:42:52.696 --> 02:42:54.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OWNERS OF TOMORROW ARE THE

02:42:54.331 --> 02:42:55.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PRESCHOOLERS OF TODAY THEY'RE

02:42:55.966 --> 02:42:56.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SITTING IN THOSE PRE SCHOOL

02:42:56.700 --> 02:42:58.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CLASSROOMS LEARNING ABOUT THE

02:42:58.335 --> 02:43:00.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE WITH? AND

02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:01.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE THIS

02:43:01.338 --> 02:43:02.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMMUNITY WHERE EVERYONE BELONGS

02:43:03.039 --> 02:43:04.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT WE START SEGREGATING EARLY

02:43:04.307 --> 02:43:05.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE SEND SOME REAL SPECIFIC

02:43:05.275 --> 02:43:07.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MESSAGES SO I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD

02:43:08.044 --> 02:43:09.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A LOT OF THE OTHER LOGISTICS

02:43:09.112 --> 02:43:10.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TODAY THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER

02:43:10.147 --> 02:43:11.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POINTS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE

02:43:11.681 --> 02:43:13.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
JUST IN TERMS OF. OUR OWN

02:43:13.216 --> 02:43:15.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESPONSIBILITIES AS A AS A STATE

ACCEPTING THE MORE THAN ONE

02:43:18.155 --> 02:43:19.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE ACCEPT

02:43:19.556 --> 02:43:20.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE

02:43:20.423 --> 02:43:22.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCEPTING. THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:43:22.859 --> 02:43:23.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WITH

02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:26.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISABILITIES TO GET ACCESS TO. A

02:43:26.463 --> 02:43:28.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
FREE APPROPRIATE PUBLIC

02:43:28.165 --> 02:43:29.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EDUCATION THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE

02:43:29.199 --> 02:43:30.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT DOES THAT

02:43:30.167 --> 02:43:31.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MEAN THAT REALLY MEANS THAT IT

02:43:32.035 --> 02:43:33.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STARTS AS EVERY STUDENTS IN

02:43:33.103 --> 02:43:34.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GENERAL AT STUDENT LIKE WE HEARD

02:43:34.704 --> 02:43:37.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EARLIER. AND THAT SCHOOL STARTS

02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:38.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH THEIR GENERAL ED PEERS AND

02:43:38.842 --> 02:43:39.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE IT TO GET

02:43:39.876 --> 02:43:41.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INTO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO EARN

02:43:41.244 --> 02:43:42.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOUR WAY INTO GENERAL LET EVEN

02:43:42.612 --> 02:43:44.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN PRESCHOOL. REALLY YOU YOU

02:43:44.514 --> 02:43:45.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE TO EARN A TICKET OUT AND

02:43:45.916 --> 02:43:47.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S ONLY AFTER EVERY SUPPORT

02:43:47.584 --> 02:43:49.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SERVICES BEEN PUT IN PLACE.

02:43:49.319 --> 02:43:50.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE WORD HOLDING AS A DEPARTMENT

02:43:50.854 --> 02:43:52.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AS WE'RE DOING OUR MONITORING OR

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:53.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HOLDING DISTRICTS TO A MUCH

02:43:53.924 --> 02:43:56.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HIGHER STANDARD AROUND.

02:43:56.126 --> 02:43:57.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENSURING THAT STUDENTS DO HAVE

02:43:57.994 --> 02:43:59.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCESS TO GENERAL AND WERE BEING

02:44:00.063 --> 02:44:00.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PUSHED IN OUR LAWSUITS FOR THE

02:44:00.997 --> 02:44:03.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAME THING. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:04.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO THAT AND WE TRULY BELIEVE IN

02:44:04.768 --> 02:44:06.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EQUITY WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

02:44:06.703 --> 02:44:08.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FUND OUR DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:09.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SERVE EVERY SINGLE STUDENT IN

02:44:09.873 --> 02:44:10.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT LEAST RESTRICTIVE

02:44:11.007 --> 02:44:11.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ENVIRONMENT AND FOR SOME

02:44:11.975 --> 02:44:13.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS. IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:14.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT MIGHT MEAN A STUDENT WITH

02:44:15.011 --> 02:44:17.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES NEEDS

02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:18.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO HAVE A NURSE IN THE CLASSROOM

02:44:18.715 --> 02:44:21.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OR PARA EDUCATOR OR A LITANY OF

02:44:21.384 --> 02:44:22.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINGS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN.

02:44:22.686 --> 02:44:24.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE

02:44:24.354 --> 02:44:25.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO

02:44:25.555 --> 02:44:26.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THAT CLASSROOM.

02:44:26.957 --> 02:44:28.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN

02:44:28.158 --> 02:44:28.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IS.

02:44:28.658 --> 02:44:30.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ELEAZAR AND AND I DON'T I AGREE

02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:33.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO WANTS TO

02:44:33.196 --> 02:44:34.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEGREGATE KIDS AND DOESN'T WANT

02:44:34.331 --> 02:44:35.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEM TO GET EVERYTHING THEY NEED

02:44:35.699 --> 02:44:37.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT AT SOME POINT. YOU HAVE TO

02:44:37.234 --> 02:44:39.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MAKE FISCAL CHOICES AROUND

02:44:39.135 --> 02:44:40.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND THEN WE

02:44:40.770 --> 02:44:42.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SEE THINGS LIKE SPECIAL DAY

02:44:42.105 --> 02:44:44.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
CLASSES OF KIDS FROM

02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:45.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FIFTH
GRADE.

02:44:46.009 --> 02:44:47.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

TO GENERAL AS POSSIBLE IS

02:46:06.523 --> 02:46:08.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMETHING THAT WILL COST MORE

02:46:09.025 --> 02:46:10.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MONEY. AND IF WE EXPECT EQUITY

02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:12.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

OF ALL OF OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS I

02:46:22.639 --> 02:46:24.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK AROUND SIX HUNDRED OF THEM

02:48:54.924 --> 02:48:56.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE CMS ENDS OF WHY OTHER STATES

02:48:56.593 --> 02:48:57.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE ABLE TO DO THIS AND WHY ARE

02:48:57.727 --> 02:48:59.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE NOT ABLE TO I MEAN I THINK

02:48:59.996 --> 02:49:00.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

02:49:00.196 --> 02:49:01.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

02:49:01.231 --> 02:49:02.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
OPPORTUNITY.

02:49:02.499 --> 02:49:04.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I'VE JUST JUST JUST.

02:49:04.734 --> 02:49:07.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVEN AT THE BOTTOM QUARTILE WE

02:49:07.303 --> 02:49:08.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE. YOU KNOW GETTING ABOUT A

02:49:08.204 --> 02:49:09.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY

02:49:09.606 --> 02:49:11.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SEVEN MILLION.

02:49:11.341 --> 02:49:12.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF YOU'RE IN THE TOP QUARTILE I

02:49:12.775 --> 02:49:14.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DON'T KNOW THAT BECOME LIKE.

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:15.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED

02:49:15.912 --> 02:49:18.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MILLION THE I THINK. I THINK THE

02:49:18.648 --> 02:49:20.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCHOOLS COULD USE THAT MONEY SO

02:49:20.083 --> 02:49:21.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE BABY CAN COMMENT ON THAT

02:49:21.885 --> 02:49:23.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO

02:49:23.119 --> 02:49:23.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ADDRESS.

02:49:23.386 --> 02:49:24.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ARE BELIEVED TO DRAW DOWN

02:49:24.787 --> 02:49:26.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FEDERAL FUNDS THROUGHOUT THE A

02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:28.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND MA. THROUGH THE MEDICAID

02:49:28.424 --> 02:49:29.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROGRAM.

02:49:29.592 --> 02:49:31.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT I WISH I HAD AN EASY ANSWER

02:49:31.194 --> 02:49:32.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO THAT ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES

02:49:32.829 --> 02:49:35.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT I HAVE IS AS A MEMBER OF

02:49:35.298 --> 02:49:36.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR

02:49:36.499 --> 02:49:37.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ADMINISTRATORS FOR SPECIAL

02:49:37.634 --> 02:49:38.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EDUCATION THROUGH THE COUNCIL

02:49:38.968 --> 02:49:41.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN. AND SO

02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:43.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TWICE A MONTH I'M ON A CALL WITH

02:49:43.139 --> 02:49:45.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY.

02:49:45.308 --> 02:49:47.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND EVERY OTHER STATE. USES

02:49:47.610 --> 02:49:49.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THESE MONIES TO FUND CLINICS AND

02:49:49.412 --> 02:49:50.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY GET IT AND IT'S JUST PART

02:49:50.813 --> 02:49:52.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THE PROCESS BUT THEY DO HAVE

02:49:52.348 --> 02:49:54.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME DIFFERENT RULES. AND SO AT

02:49:54.384 --> 02:49:55.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ONE POINT EARLY ON IN THIS

02:49:55.952 --> 02:49:57.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISCUSSION I REMEMBER US LOOKING

02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:59.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTO. I'M A COUPLE OF THE OTHER

02:49:59.422 --> 02:50:02.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STATES DISABLED EXACTLY WHAT

02:50:02.125 --> 02:50:03.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT ARE YOUR RULES SO THAT WE

02:50:03.493 --> 02:50:06.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAN LOOK AT HOW DO WE DIFFER.

02:50:06.162 --> 02:50:06.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE MIGHT

02:50:06.930 --> 02:50:08.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BE SOME REGULATORY CHANGES THAT

02:50:08.531 --> 02:50:10.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COULD DO THAT BUT THEN WE ALSO

02:50:10.466 --> 02:50:12.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT.

02:50:12.168 --> 02:50:13.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUSINESSES THAT SOME OF WHICH

02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:15.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE COME AND GONE AND I'M NOT

02:50:15.338 --> 02:50:17.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE FIELD ANYMORE SO I CAN'T

02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:19.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GIVE YOU THE THE LATEST UPDATE.

02:50:19.442 --> 02:50:20.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT I KNOW PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY

02:50:20.677 --> 02:50:23.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT

02:50:23.246 --> 02:50:23.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
BECAUSE WE'RE.

02:50:23.746 --> 02:50:25.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL

02:50:25.982 --> 02:50:28.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SPECIAL ED POPULATION.

02:50:28.151 --> 02:50:30.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND IN THE BOTTOM QUARTILE.

02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:31.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR WHAT

02:50:31.921 --> 02:50:33.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WE COULD BE ACCESSING

02:50:33.323 --> 02:50:34.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
POTENTIALLY.

02:50:34.924 --> 02:50:35.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WELL I JUST POINT OUT IN

02:50:35.925 --> 02:50:37.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADDITION TO SERVING ON THE.

02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:39.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EDUCATION COMMITTEE ASKED THE

CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE

02:50:40.697 --> 02:50:41.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

02:50:42.031 --> 02:50:44.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT OVERSEES THE MEDICAID. OUR

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:46.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MEDICAL PROGRAM SO AND SO I'M

02:50:46.936 --> 02:50:49.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
VERY VERY INTERESTED IN THIS AND

02:50:49.973 --> 02:50:50.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN SOLVE THIS

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:52.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROBLEM.

02:50:52.575 --> 02:50:53.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BE HAPPY TO HELP WORK WITH YOU

02:50:53.610 --> 02:50:56.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
ON THAT THANK YOU.

02:50:56.980 --> 02:51:00.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THE QUESTIONS AND.

02:51:00.216 --> 02:51:02.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH YEAH I HAD TO STEP OUTSIDE

02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:03.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
APOLOGIZE IF IF YOU IF YOU

02:51:03.219 --> 02:51:04.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MENTION IS WE TALKED OUR LAST

02:51:04.988 --> 02:51:06.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TWO PANELS AS FAR AS THE THE

02:51:06.656 --> 02:51:09.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EQUALIZATION OR. WHATNOT WHICH

02:51:09.993 --> 02:51:11.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT YOU KNOW

02:51:11.961 --> 02:51:13.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOING BACK TO THE TWENTY YEAR

02:51:13.196 --> 02:51:15.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MODEL JUST FINDING IT PER

02:51:15.131 --> 02:51:16.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
STUDENT SERVED.

02:51:16.265 --> 02:51:18.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS OF WHAT

02:51:18.501 --> 02:51:20.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO FOR REALLY

02:51:20.203 --> 02:51:22.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WANTED? ADDRESS THAT THE FISCAL

02:51:22.205 --> 02:51:24.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ISSUES NOT THE NOT THE POLICY

02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:25.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
SIDE.

02:51:25.808 --> 02:51:28.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO ONE NIGHT. I DID ADDRESS THAT

02:51:28.611 --> 02:51:29.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE YOU HAD

02:51:29.746 --> 02:51:31.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IF

02:51:31.414 --> 02:51:34.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE JUST WHEN INTEL CFO. AND SO.

02:51:34.817 --> 02:51:37.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE COMPARISON IS THAT EVERY

02:51:37.153 --> 02:51:38.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISTRICT THROUGH LCF UP IS NOW

02:51:38.621 --> 02:51:41.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GETTING AN EIGHTY EIGHT RIGHT.

02:51:41.591 --> 02:51:43.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ANDSO WHAT IS EQUALLY TRUE IS

02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:46.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT EVERY DISTRICT EVERY CELL

02:51:46.763 --> 02:51:49.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT GETS A RATE ALSO FOR SPECIAL

02:51:49.732 --> 02:51:51.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LED THE DIFFERENCE FOR US IS

02:51:51.668 --> 02:51:52.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT THOSE RATES DIFFER SO

02:51:53.036 --> 02:51:55.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIGNIFICANTLY. SO IF YOU WERE TO

02:51:55.738 --> 02:51:58.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAY THAT LET'S KEEP THIS IN A

02:51:58.274 --> 02:52:00.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIMILAR MODEL AS LCF HALF. THE

02:52:00.443 --> 02:52:02.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POINT WOULD BE TO EQUALIZE THOSE

02:52:02.145 --> 02:52:05.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOLLARS SO THAT THE ADA RATE FOR

02:52:05.248 --> 02:52:07.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPECIAL ED PURPOSES. COULDN'T BE

02:52:07.617 --> 02:52:10.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PART OF THAT CONVERSATION BUT IT

02:52:10.787 --> 02:52:12.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WOULD BE EQUALIZED BUT THE

02:52:12.288 --> 02:52:15.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DIFFERENCE IS FRANKLY THAT

02:52:15.191 --> 02:52:17.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE. ID A IS AN ENTITLEMENT

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:19.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SPECIAL ED IS AN ENTITLEMENT

02:52:19.328 --> 02:52:20.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TO PEOPLE.

02:52:20.730 --> 02:52:22.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I BELIEVE AND I'M NOT A PARENT

02:52:22.932 --> 02:52:23.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT

02:52:23.766 --> 02:52:26.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROTECTION OF HAVING IT BE THE

02:52:26.202 --> 02:52:27.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONE REMAINING CATEGORICAL IS

02:52:27.637 --> 02:52:29.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN MONITOR

02:52:29.739 --> 02:52:31.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE CAN REPORT. IS A LOT OF

02:52:32.041 --> 02:52:32.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE

02:52:32.675 --> 02:52:34.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE TO HAVE THE PROTECTION BUT

02:52:34.477 --> 02:52:36.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SHOULD WE ALSO DO THE

02:52:36.446 --> 02:52:39.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EQUALIZATION OR FUNDED BY THE

02:52:39.515 --> 02:52:40.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STATE THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS

02:52:40.650 --> 02:52:43.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ACTUALLY SIR SO THEN. SENT

02:52:43.152 --> 02:52:45.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
DISTRICTS ARE ARE GETTING A
TRUE.

02:52:45.788 --> 02:52:48.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT OUT YET COMPENSATION OR

02:52:48.191 --> 02:52:49.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALLOCATION BASED UPON THE WORK

02:52:49.392 --> 02:52:50.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT'S BEING DONE I THINK

02:52:50.827 --> 02:52:52.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT.

02:52:52.095 --> 02:52:53.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RESPONSES TO THAT DURING THE

02:52:53.963 --> 02:52:56.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EIGHTY SIX SO TO CONVERSATIONS

02:52:56.132 --> 02:52:57.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE

02:52:57.300 --> 02:53:00.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DECISION TO GO TO AN EIGHTY A

02:53:00.336 --> 02:53:03.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RATE ULTIMATELY. WAS BECAUSE IF

02:53:03.306 --> 02:53:05.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YOU LOOK ACROSS THE STATE.

02:53:05.074 --> 02:53:06.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT LETS THEM IN FREMONT I'M

02:53:06.776 --> 02:53:08.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GONNA HAVE A HIGHER POPULATION

02:53:08.244 --> 02:53:10.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF KIDS WHO ARE DEAF BECAUSE THE

02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:12.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF IS RIGHT

02:53:12.181 --> 02:53:13.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THERE. BUT IF I'M IN MODOC

02:53:13.449 --> 02:53:15.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
COUNTY I HAVE A HIGHER

02:53:15.218 --> 02:53:16.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POPULATION OF KIDS WHO REQUIRE

02:53:16.385 --> 02:53:18.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SIGNIFICANT TRANSPORTATION OR

02:53:18.588 --> 02:53:20.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTH OR OTHER DIFFERENT KINDS

02:53:20.623 --> 02:53:24.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF NEEDS IN. THE RANGE OF NEEDS

02:53:24.293 --> 02:53:26.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN AT THE SYSTEM AS WIDE AS OURS

02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:28.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH SOME WOULD YOU SAY SEVEN

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:30.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

02:53:30.833 --> 02:53:33.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDENTS IN. EIGHT STATES ACROSS

02:53:33.836 --> 02:53:35.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE GEOGRAPHY OF CALIFORNIA. IT

02:53:36.038 --> 02:53:38.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT FELT LIKE IT WAS THE FAIR

02:53:38.508 --> 02:53:41.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THING TO DO TO AVERAGE OUT THAT

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:43.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACROSS ALL THOSE SYSTEMS BECAUSE

02:53:43.146 --> 02:53:45.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF THE DIFFERING NEEDS. AN

02:53:45.181 --> 02:53:46.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EIGHTY A RATE THAT WOULD GO

02:53:46.182 --> 02:53:47.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACROSS THOSE NUMBERS SEEM TO BE

02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:49.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE MOST FAIR THAT THE MISSING

02:53:50.019 --> 02:53:51.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PIECE REALLY WAS INCLUDING PRE

02:53:51.988 --> 02:53:53.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
SCHOOL AT THE TIME.

02:53:53.156 --> 02:53:56.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THANK YOU.

02:53:56.692 --> 02:53:58.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAH SOON MEMBER MEMBERS CITY SO

02:53:58.661 --> 02:53:59.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I I JUST WANNA FOLLOW UP ON THAT

02:53:59.729 --> 02:54:03.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO THEM SO ARE YOU SAYING. THAT.

02:54:03.099 --> 02:54:05.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
LIKES A.

02:54:05.802 --> 02:54:07.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I MEAN I. MEAN IT IS IT SEEMS TO

02:54:07.537 --> 02:54:08.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT THAT THE

02:54:08.805 --> 02:54:10.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOLLAR'S FALL THE STUDENTS WITH

02:54:10.439 --> 02:54:12.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE GREATEST NEEDS. JUST LIKE

02:54:12.575 --> 02:54:14.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF LCL PATH

02:54:14.944 --> 02:54:17.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BUT BUT YOU'RE SAYING.

02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:18.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO

02:54:19.015 --> 02:54:21.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACHIEVE LIKE SAY THE ECONOMIES

02:54:21.217 --> 02:54:22.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF SCALE OF OF PROVIDING

02:54:22.218 --> 02:54:23.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TRANSPORTATION AND REAL

02:54:23.619 --> 02:54:25.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISTRICTS THAT THAT THAT IS.

02:54:25.121 --> 02:54:27.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THAT IS ONE REASON WHY YOU

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:28.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE THE

02:54:28.691 --> 02:54:30.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOLLAR'S FALL IN THE STUDENT IT

02:54:30.326 --> 02:54:31.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WASN'T JUST THAT ABOUT

02:54:31.394 --> 02:54:32.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRANSPORTATION IT WAS THAT WHEN

02:54:32.862 --> 02:54:34.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU TALK TO THE ENTIRE RANGE OF

02:54:35.031 --> 02:54:37.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOSE SELF REPRESENTATION WHO'S

02:54:37.266 --> 02:54:39.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHO REPRESENT THEN ALL OF THESE.

02:54:39.202 --> 02:54:39.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KIDS AND WE WORKED WITH THE

02:54:40.036 --> 02:54:41.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT THE

02:54:41.237 --> 02:54:45.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TIME TO TO LOOK AT THAT RANGE OF

02:54:45.174 --> 02:54:47.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEEDS. EVERY PART OF THE STATE

02:54:47.276 --> 02:54:50.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAS A DIFFERING SET OF DEMANDS

02:54:50.179 --> 02:54:51.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO WHEN YOU TRY TO GET ONE

02:54:51.614 --> 02:54:53.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANSWER IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN

02:54:53.316 --> 02:54:54.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ANSWER FOR THIS DISTRICT BUT IT

02:54:54.784 --> 02:54:56.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS AN ANSWER FOR HERE. BUT IT IS

02:54:56.786 --> 02:54:59.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRUE THAT MORE STUDENTS WITH

02:54:59.722 --> 02:55:01.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MORE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS HAVE

02:55:02.058 --> 02:55:04.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECOME PART OF THE SYSTEM. AND

02:55:04.227 --> 02:55:05.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE IDEAS

02:55:06.062 --> 02:55:07.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY TALKED

02:55:07.563 --> 02:55:10.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABOUT IS WHAT IF YOU ADD SOME

02:55:10.199 --> 02:55:12.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KIND OF ADDITIVE FACTOR FOR

02:55:12.535 --> 02:55:13.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE THE MOST

02:55:13.936 --> 02:55:15.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXPENSIVE. BUT THEN I WOULD GO

02:55:15.705 --> 02:55:17.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BACK TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE TO

02:55:17.874 --> 02:55:18.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SERVE. I WOULD GO BACK TO THE

02:55:18.808 --> 02:55:20.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONVERSATION THAT YOU WOULDN'T

02:55:20.142 --> 02:55:20.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WANT TO HAVE ANY KIND OF

02:55:20.910 --> 02:55:23.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOLUTION THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE.

02:55:23.813 --> 02:55:24.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
A.

02:55:24.213 --> 02:55:27.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

02:55:27.216 --> 02:55:28.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:31.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY

02:55:31.187 --> 02:55:32.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO WAY BACK WHEN I WAS A SCHOOL

02:55:32.488 --> 02:55:34.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PSYCHOLOGIST AND REALLY THE

02:55:34.323 --> 02:55:35.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NUMBER THAT WAS MANIPULATED THE

02:55:35.791 --> 02:55:38.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MOST WAS A SPECIFIC LEARNING

02:55:38.427 --> 02:55:39.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISABILITY OR HEATHER AND I WERE

02:55:39.695 --> 02:55:41.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT WAS YOUR

02:55:41.597 --> 02:55:43.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNIT RATE. THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY

02:55:43.366 --> 02:55:45.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT YOU COULD MANIPULATE IT YOU

02:55:45.134 --> 02:55:45.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST DON'T WANT TO BE REALLY

02:55:45.935 --> 02:55:48.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAREFUL ABOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO

02:55:48.437 --> 02:55:51.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOLLOW SOMETHING THAT IS. AN

02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:53.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IDENTIFIABLE BUT NOT MANIPULATE

02:55:53.376 --> 02:55:55.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A BULL. NUMBER I ANSWER THAT TOO

02:55:55.645 --> 02:55:57.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
JUST IN THE SENSE THAT.

02:55:57.146 --> 02:55:58.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CDC

02:55:58.848 --> 02:56:00.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IS JUST DONE WITH THE NEW

02:56:00.316 --> 02:56:02.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CREDENTIAL IS CHANGED FROM.

02:56:02.351 --> 02:56:03.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
BEING MORE LABELED.

02:56:03.619 --> 02:56:04.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ABOUT THAT THE STUDENT THE

02:56:04.887 --> 02:56:07.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISABILITY AND CHANGE THAT SORT

02:56:07.123 --> 02:56:08.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THE LEVEL OF NEED AND SO ONE

02:56:08.624 --> 02:56:10.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WAY OF RETHINKING THIS

02:56:10.159 --> 02:56:14.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
CONVERSATION ACROSS EVERY
DISABILITY

02:56:14.530 --> 02:56:15.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CATEGORY FOR THE MOST PART

02:56:15.965 --> 02:56:18.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S A FULL RANGE OF SUPPORT

02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:19.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEEDS. SUMMER VERY MINIMAL AND

02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:23.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME ARE VERY EXTENSIVE AND SO.

02:56:23.639 --> 02:56:25.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONE THOUGHT IS THAT AS WE'RE

02:56:25.174 --> 02:56:27.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOKING AT SORT THIS WHOLE SIX

02:56:27.143 --> 02:56:29.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OH TWO EQUALIZATION THAT'S THAT

02:56:29.278 --> 02:56:30.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOLVES. PART OF THE PROBLEM THE

02:56:30.846 --> 02:56:32.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OTHER PROBLEM REALLY S THE

02:56:32.081 --> 02:56:32.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HIGHER NEED STUDENTS AND THAT

02:56:32.949 --> 02:56:34.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR THE FOLKS

02:56:34.650 --> 02:56:36.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT HAVE. LESS ECONOMIES OF

02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:38.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCALE RIGHT BECAUSE ONE STUDENT

02:56:38.154 --> 02:56:39.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHO HAS TO GO TO A NON PUBLIC

02:56:39.322 --> 02:56:40.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SCHOOL THINKS THE SHIP

02:56:40.256 --> 02:56:42.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ESSENTIALLY. SO HOW DO WE

02:56:42.458 --> 02:56:44.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCOUNT FOR THAT HIGH NEEDS HIGH

02:56:45.027 --> 02:56:46.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LEVEL OF SUPPORT POPULATION

02:56:46.495 --> 02:56:47.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ACROSS ALL THE DISABILITY

02:56:47.730 --> 02:56:49.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CATEGORIES IT'S REALLY ABOUT. IF

02:56:49.932 --> 02:56:50.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU HAVE A STUDENT WITH REALLY

02:56:50.599 --> 02:56:51.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXPENSIVE NEEDS HOW ARE YOU

02:56:52.001 --> 02:56:53.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GOING TO MEET THOSE AND SO

02:56:53.469 --> 02:56:55.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERHAPS THERE'S A TWEENER THERE

02:56:55.338 --> 02:56:58.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SOMEWHERE.

02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:00.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
RIGHT AND IT DOESN'T
INCENTIVIZE.

02:57:00.810 --> 02:57:01.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ANY KIND OF ENVIRONMENT OR

02:57:01.344 --> 02:57:02.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ANYTHING ELSE.

02:57:02.378 --> 02:57:04.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I FLESH OUT THESE LAST TWO

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMMENTS DO YOU HAVE. I THINK

02:57:05.848 --> 02:57:06.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE ALL IDENTIFYING THE NEEDLE

02:57:06.949 --> 02:57:08.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS BETRAYED DO HAVE PARTICULAR

02:57:08.718 --> 02:57:09.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO THREAD THE

02:57:09.318 --> 02:57:10.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
NEEDLE.

02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:12.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN TERMS OF CRAFTING A SYSTEM

02:57:12.388 --> 02:57:14.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WILL. STRIKE THAT BALANCE

02:57:14.223 --> 02:57:15.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS

02:57:15.591 --> 02:57:16.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF MAKING SURE THERE'S SOME

02:57:16.659 --> 02:57:18.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ADDED A FACTOR TO REFLECT THE

02:57:18.361 --> 02:57:20.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER.

02:57:20.196 --> 02:57:21.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
NEEDS AS AN EDUCATIONAL

02:57:21.764 --> 02:57:23.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PROVISION WITH WITHOUT

02:57:23.532 --> 02:57:26.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
INCENTIVIZING.

02:57:26.369 --> 02:57:27.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
YEAH BAD BEHAVIOR FROM A

02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:31.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE.

02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:32.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I THINK THE MOST PART THE

02:57:32.508 --> 02:57:34.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STUDENTS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT

02:57:34.410 --> 02:57:36.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SUPPORT NEEDS ARE NOT ONES THAT

02:57:36.645 --> 02:57:38.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT CAN BE HIDDEN. AND THEY'RE

02:57:38.214 --> 02:57:39.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOT ONES THAT PETETHAT FOLKS

02:57:39.949 --> 02:57:40.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE GOING TO JUST TRY TO GET

02:57:40.549 --> 02:57:42.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MORE MONEY BECAUSE I THINK MOST

02:57:42.685 --> 02:57:44.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOLKS MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE.

02:57:44.620 --> 02:57:46.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THAT LEVEL OF STUDENT IS

02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO

02:57:47.056 --> 02:57:48.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BE INCENTIVIZED AND MANY OF

02:57:48.958 --> 02:57:50.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOSE STUDENTS ARE IDENTIFIED

02:57:50.092 --> 02:57:51.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUT OF OUR EARLY INTERVENTION.

02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:53.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T JUST

02:57:53.162 --> 02:57:54.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POP IN IN LESS THERE'S SOMETHING

02:57:54.430 --> 02:57:55.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT HAPPENS TO THEM LATER IN

02:57:55.464 --> 02:57:57.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
LIFE SO.

02:57:57.133 --> 02:57:58.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:57:58.167 --> 02:57:59.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LIKE WHAT IS THE SOLUTION. I

02:57:59.602 --> 02:58:01.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINK I THINK IF WE CAN AGREE

02:58:01.303 --> 02:58:03.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THAT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE

02:58:03.506 --> 02:58:05.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT WE HAVE LIKE A A. BASED

02:58:05.241 --> 02:58:06.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AGREEMENT ON EQUALIZATION IN

02:58:07.009 --> 02:58:07.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE THINGS COULD BECAUSE

02:58:07.977 --> 02:58:08.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE ARE IN

02:58:08.844 --> 02:58:10.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE CONVERSATION WE HAVEN'T HAD

02:58:10.246 --> 02:58:11.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOSE OTHER CONVERSATIONS YET

02:58:11.514 --> 02:58:13.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT WE ARE. WE AT WE WERE FULLY

02:58:13.749 --> 02:58:16.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPEN TO THAT AND WOULD LOVE TO

02:58:16.352 --> 02:58:18.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE ADDITIONAL. BRAINSTORMING

02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:20.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SESSIONS.

02:58:20.256 --> 02:58:21.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND APPRECIATE THAT WE'VE HAD

02:58:21.490 --> 02:58:22.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR STAFF AS

02:58:22.425 --> 02:58:23.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WELL JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT

02:58:23.726 --> 02:58:25.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT COULD LOOK LIKE LET'S DO

02:58:25.594 --> 02:58:26.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT I MEAN A AND I ATE IN IN IT

02:58:27.063 --> 02:58:29.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
AND I GUESS.

02:58:29.265 --> 02:58:29.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY MAYBE YOU'RE

02:58:29.899 --> 02:58:33.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
RIGHT RIGHT IF IF.

02:58:33.235 --> 02:58:35.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE REAL COST DRIVER. IS FOR IS

02:58:35.938 --> 02:58:37.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IN THE AREA THE MORE.

02:58:37.706 --> 02:58:41.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
HIGH SEVERITY.

02:58:41.177 --> 02:58:44.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I STUDENTS. AND IF THEY'RE YOU

02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:44.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KNOW THEY'RE THERE IS PRESUMABLY

02:58:44.814 --> 02:58:46.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
LESS.

02:58:46.248 --> 02:58:48.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPPORTUNITY FOR A BAD ACTOR TO

02:58:48.117 --> 02:58:49.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
MANIPULATE.

02:58:49.518 --> 02:58:52.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT SORT OF DIAGNOSIS.

02:58:52.354 --> 02:58:54.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FIVE AND SO MAYBE MAYBE THAT'S

02:58:54.290 --> 02:58:55.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHERE. MAYBE THAT'S GONNA KIND

02:58:55.324 --> 02:58:56.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
OF.

02:58:56.926 --> 02:58:58.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADDRESS THIS KEY PROBLEM. I

02:58:58.561 --> 02:59:00.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THINK FOR EXAMPLE A MEDICAL

02:59:00.296 --> 02:59:02.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIAGNOSIS SO. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE

02:59:02.431 --> 02:59:03.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TALKED ABOUT THE LOW INCIDENCE

02:59:03.466 --> 02:59:05.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMUNITY BEING SUCH AN AD AND

02:59:05.801 --> 02:59:07.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EASILY IDENTIFIABLE POTENTIAL

02:59:07.636 --> 02:59:09.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GROUP BECAUSE EITHER YOUR YOUR

02:59:09.472 --> 02:59:11.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DEATH FOR YOU OR NOT EITHER

02:59:11.140 --> 02:59:12.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOURS TO GREATLY HARD OF HEARING

02:59:12.775 --> 02:59:14.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OR YOU'RE. BLIND THOSE ARE

02:59:14.577 --> 02:59:16.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EASILY IDENTIFIABLE AND NOT

02:59:16.812 --> 02:59:18.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PARTICULARLY DEBATABLE.

02:59:18.781 --> 02:59:19.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SO THE LOW INCIDENCE

02:59:19.815 --> 02:59:21.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISABILITIES ARE CLEARLY ONE

02:59:21.617 --> 02:59:23.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT COULD BE. COULD BE LOOKED

02:59:23.819 --> 02:59:24.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AT BUT THEN IF YOU LOOK AT

02:59:24.653 --> 02:59:26.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AUTISM WHICH USED TO BE

02:59:26.088 --> 02:59:28.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CONSIDERED A LOW INCIDENCE

02:59:28.190 --> 02:59:29.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISABILITY AND IS NOW AT. EIGHT

02:59:29.291 --> 02:59:31.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PERCENT OF THE SPECIAL ED

02:59:31.527 --> 02:59:33.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
POPULATION IN THE STATE.

02:59:33.729 --> 02:59:35.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOWING THAT THAT'S A SPECTRUM

02:59:35.331 --> 02:59:37.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISORDER AND NOT EVERY CHILD

02:59:37.433 --> 02:59:41.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH AUTISM. IS A OF THE LEVEL

02:59:41.170 --> 02:59:42.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF NEED THAT KRISTEN WAS JUST

02:59:42.404 --> 02:59:44.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADDRESSING AND SO IT WOULD BE A

02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:46.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MATTER REALLY BEING VERY CAREFUL

02:59:46.308 --> 02:59:48.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT WHO COULD BE INCLUDED. OUT

02:59:48.210 --> 02:59:51.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RATIONALLY AND AND IN A FAIR WAY

02:59:51.180 --> 02:59:52.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT GOES BACK TO NOT HAVE NOT

02:59:52.681 --> 02:59:54.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE LABEL DRIVING IT BUT RATHER

02:59:54.083 --> 02:59:55.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

RIGHT EXACTLY.

02:59:58.254 --> 02:59:59.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND HOW TO CRAFT A SYSTEM OF

02:59:59.221 --> 03:00:01.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACTION AND WORK ON THE STATE

03:00:01.090 --> 03:00:02.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEVEL IF IT WITH THE SIZE AND

03:00:02.925 --> 03:00:06.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
COMPLEXITY OF OUR SYSTEM.

THIS BEEN REALLY ENLIGHTENING

03:01:33.182 --> 03:01:35.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND CCS A DEFINITELY APPLIES THE

03:01:35.251 --> 03:01:37.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMITTEE'S FOCUS ON TAKING THE

03:01:37.853 --> 03:01:39.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
APPROPRIATE STEPS TO CREATE. ONE

03:01:39.355 --> 03:01:41.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM THAT IS PREPARED TO SERVE

FOR EACH AND EVERY STUDENT.

03:01:43.225 --> 03:01:44.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

03:01:47.263 --> 03:01:49.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

REALLY TALK ABOUT SPECIAL

03:01:51.333 --> 03:01:53.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EDUCATION IN CHARTER SCHOOLS

03:01:53.335 --> 03:01:54.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WITHOUT IDENTIFYING THE TWO

03:01:55.004 --> 03:01:56.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DECISIONS THAT DEFINE WHO

RECEIVED THE MONEY. AND WHO

03:01:58.540 --> 03:01:59.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HOLDS THE RESPONSIBILITY.

03:02:00.009 --> 03:02:01.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WITHOUT THAT CONTEXT AND

03:02:01.176 --> 03:02:03.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISTINCTION YOU CAN'T REALLY

03:02:03.279 --> 03:02:05.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCURATELY DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS.

03:02:05.814 --> 03:02:06.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT

ACHIEVE.

03:06:16.999 --> 03:06:19.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I KNOW FINDING IS A HUGE ISSUE

03:06:19.268 --> 03:06:21.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
OBVIOUSLY BUT I WONDER IF
WESHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. SOME

03:06:21.537 --> 03:06:23.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SORT OF INTEGRATED EDUCATION

STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION

03:06:29.211 --> 03:06:30.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHILE KEEPING THOSE PROTECTIONS

03:06:30.712 --> 03:06:32.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED.

03:06:33.015 --> 03:06:34.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I HAVE FOUND A PRESUMPTION OF

03:06:34.316 --> 03:06:36.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
INCOMPETENCE.

03:06:36.318 --> 03:06:38.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'M IN A LACK OF INDIVIDUALLY

03:06:38.153 --> 03:06:41.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INDIVIDUALITY AND MY SONS IEP.

03:06:41.390 --> 03:06:42.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIKE ANY PARENT I WANT MY CHILD

03:06:42.858 --> 03:06:44.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL BUT

03:06:44.192 --> 03:06:45.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA I'M

03:06:45.694 --> 03:06:47.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CONSTANTLY QUESTIONED AND

03:06:47.129 --> 03:06:49.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHALLENGED. ABOUT THIS WHEN I

03:06:49.965 --> 03:06:51.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TOURED MY LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL I

03:06:51.400 --> 03:06:53.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DID NOT SEE ONE CHILD WHO LOOK

03:06:53.702 --> 03:06:55.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LIKE MINE AND THAT WAS VERY

03:06:55.203 --> 03:06:56.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TELLING THAT TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT

03:06:56.338 --> 03:06:58.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE EXPECTATION. OF STUDENTS

03:06:58.173 --> 03:07:00.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
LIKE MINE. THERE'S NO

03:07:00.142 --> 03:07:01.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXPECTATION OR MECHANISM TO

03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:03.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INCLUDE THESE STUDENTS OFTEN

03:07:03.345 --> 03:07:05.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BECAUSE THE FUNDING.

03:07:05.581 --> 03:07:07.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT'S EXHAUSTING TO CONSTANTLY

03:07:07.282 --> 03:07:09.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FIGHT. OR WHAT SENATOR WILL

03:07:09.251 --> 03:07:11.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
CALLED CIVIL RIGHTS.

03:07:11.286 --> 03:07:14.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I REGULARLY HERE CAN'T WON'T AND

03:07:14.323 --> 03:07:15.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DON'T SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

03:07:15.591 --> 03:07:17.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HAVEN'T DONE IT BEFORE.

03:07:17.893 --> 03:07:19.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TOBY DREAMS OF GOING TO COLLEGE

03:07:19.728 --> 03:07:20.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LIKE HIS BROTHER AS HE AS HE

03:07:20.629 --> 03:07:22.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SHOULD. AND I FIND IT THE VERY

03:07:22.397 --> 03:07:24.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEM THAT SHOULD BE PREPARING

03:07:24.232 --> 03:07:27.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HIM IS IS FURTHER DISABLING HIM.

03:07:27.903 --> 03:07:29.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAYBE IF WE CHANGE OUR MINDSET

03:07:29.571 --> 03:07:31.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND OUR EXPECTATIONS WE COULD

03:07:31.139 --> 03:07:32.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REDUCE THE LONG TERM NEED FOR

03:07:32.307 --> 03:07:34.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INTENSIVE SERVICES FOR MANY. AND

03:07:34.142 --> 03:07:35.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IDENTIFY EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD

03:07:36.044 --> 03:07:37.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BE REALIZED. THROUGH TRUE

03:07:37.346 --> 03:07:38.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
INTEGRATION.

03:07:38.914 --> 03:07:40.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZING

03:07:40.849 --> 03:07:41.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GROWTH AND ACHIEVEMENT WHEN WE

03:07:41.984 --> 03:07:43.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOOK AT THOSE GOALS IN THOSE

03:07:43.485 --> 03:07:44.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IP'S THAT MIGHT BE A WAY BEGIN

03:07:44.686 --> 03:07:46.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
LOOKING AT THINGS.

03:07:46.521 --> 03:07:48.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FINDING AS IT STANDS I THINK

03:07:48.357 --> 03:07:50.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REFLECTS THE WAY THAT WE AS A

03:07:50.359 --> 03:07:51.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

MELTDOWNS AND SENSORY ISSUES.

03:08:36.038 --> 03:08:38.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WE WERE AT A TOTAL LOSS

03:08:38.173 --> 03:08:39.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND AT THAT TIME MY HUSBAND

03:08:39.408 --> 03:08:40.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHRIS CHANDLER WAS AN ASSEMBLY

03:08:43.278 --> 03:08:44.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

TO DO NEXT.

03:08:52.354 --> 03:08:54.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT WAS ISOLATING AND TERRIFYING

03:08:54.723 --> 03:08:57.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

THAT FOLLOW THOSE KIDS.

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:17.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT DEPENDS ON THE SEVERITY. OF

03:12:20.228 --> 03:12:23.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VLC FF IS A GREAT MODEL IT'S AN

03:12:23.365 --> 03:12:25.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EQUITY BASED SYSTEM YOU HAVE A

03:12:25.166 --> 03:12:27.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BASE AND THEN YOU HAVE A

03:12:27.168 --> 03:12:28.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. AND THEN

03:12:28.837 --> 03:12:29.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WHEN THERE'S A CERTAIN

03:12:29.437 --> 03:12:30.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CONCENTRATION OF THOSE

03:12:30.705 --> 03:12:33.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARTICULAR STUDENTS YOU GET AN

ADDITIONAL FUNDING STREAM. I

03:12:34.776 --> 03:12:36.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT.

03:12:36.945 --> 03:12:38.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE NEED TO BE PART SPECIAL ED

03:12:38.580 --> 03:12:41.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NEEDS TO BE PART OF THAT L. CFL

03:12:41.283 --> 03:12:42.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FORMULA IT WOULD SPECIALLY IT

03:12:42.617 --> 03:12:44.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD BE A BAD THING FOR US TO

03:12:44.786 --> 03:12:46.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BE PART OF THE END DUPLICATED.

03:12:46.421 --> 03:12:47.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
COUNT.

03:12:47.255 --> 03:12:49.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT THAT SAME TYPE OF EQUITY

03:12:49.224 --> 03:12:51.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM NEEDS TO APPLY TO SPECIAL

03:12:51.893 --> 03:12:53.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ED. WHERE IT THE MONEY FOLLOWS

03:12:53.995 --> 03:12:56.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE STUDENTS AND THE AMOUNT OF

03:12:56.398 --> 03:12:57.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MONEY FOLLOWS THE KNEES? SO

03:12:57.899 --> 03:13:00.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT TO THE

03:13:00.135 --> 03:13:01.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT THAT WENT BEHIND A V. SIX

03:13:02.037 --> 03:13:04.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
R. TWO THAT SAID THAT YOU KNOW.

03:13:04.472 --> 03:13:06.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE OLD SYSTEM WHERE THE MONEY

03:13:06.641 --> 03:13:08.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REALLY FALL THE STUDENTS CREATED

03:13:08.143 --> 03:13:10.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
ALL SORTS OF PERVERSE
INCENTIVES.

03:13:10.345 --> 03:13:12.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO AT THE DETAIL THAT WAS IN

03:13:12.414 --> 03:13:14.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT SYSTEM I THINK THAT JUST

03:13:14.182 --> 03:13:16.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LIKE AL CFF THERE ARE CERTAIN

03:13:16.151 --> 03:13:17.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

MORE SEVERE CATEGORY IN ORDER TO

GET FUNDING. I THINK THAT THE.

SEEN THAT WITHIN DISTRICTS WE

03:13:58.193 --> 03:13:59.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%

RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. AND AND

03:14:01.162 --> 03:14:02.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT.

03:14:02.964 --> 03:14:04.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND WE FEEL THAT THE EQUITY

03:14:04.132 --> 03:14:06.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ISSUE IS IS SUCH THAT IT'S

03:14:06.901 --> 03:14:08.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO. TO DIRECT

BY DUE PROCESS LAST YEAR WE HAD

03:33:52.052 --> 03:33:53.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EIGHTY ONE FILINGS THAT WE

03:33:53.187 --> 03:33:55.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF

03:33:55.289 --> 03:33:56.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT. THAT COST US ABOUT FOUR

03:33:56.723 --> 03:33:58.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MILLION DOLLARS WE HAD TWENTY

03:33:58.926 --> 03:34:00.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OTHER CASES WHERE PARENTS THANK

03:34:00.494 --> 03:34:02.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOODNESS CAME TO US AND SAID WE

03:34:02.329 --> 03:34:03.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DON'T WANT TO FILE FOR DUE

03:34:03.263 --> 03:34:04.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PROCESS. WE WANT TO USE

03:34:04.798 --> 03:34:06.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

03:34:06.466 --> 03:34:08.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
METHODS AND WE WERE ABLE TO COME

03:34:08.335 --> 03:34:09.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THOSE

03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:11.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARENTS. WE REALLY SEE A SHIFT

03:34:11.104 --> 03:34:12.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN OUR CULTURE BECAUSE OF THE

03:34:12.639 --> 03:34:14.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
GRANTS.

03:34:14.241 --> 03:34:16.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO IN THE END I WOULD SUGGEST

03:34:16.443 --> 03:34:18.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WE REALLY REALLY DO NEED TO

03:34:18.312 --> 03:34:20.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOK AT A GROWTH FACTOR OF SOME

03:34:20.447 --> 03:34:20.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RECENT SHIFT IN OUR CULTURE

03:34:21.048 --> 03:34:23.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE OF THE. ADR GRANT EDR

03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:26.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GREEN HAS THE FIVE YEAR ADR

03:34:26.186 --> 03:34:26.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GRANT FOR TWENTY THOUSAND PER

03:34:26.954 --> 03:34:28.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEAR. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING

03:34:28.655 --> 03:34:31.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
pWITH OUR PARENTS AND OUR OUR

03:34:31.892 --> 03:34:34.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISTRICTS TO. REALLY MAKE SOME

03:34:34.261 --> 03:34:35.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DIFFERENCES AND DESCENDED

03:34:35.929 --> 03:34:37.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
CONFERENCES.

03:34:37.164 --> 03:34:39.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SO I WOULD RECOMMEND.

03:34:40.033 --> 03:34:41.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOME KIND OF A GROWTH FACTOR

03:34:41.435 --> 03:34:43.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BECAUSE AS YOU SAW ADA IS

03:34:43.270 --> 03:34:44.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DECLINING AND YET OUR STUDENT

03:34:44.404 --> 03:34:46.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POPULATION IT'S SPECIAL IT IS

03:34:46.306 --> 03:34:47.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GROWING. WE DESPERATELY NEED

03:34:47.708 --> 03:34:49.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
EQUALIZATION.

03:34:49.509 --> 03:34:51.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRESCHOOL I HAVE A DAUGHTER WITH

03:34:51.311 --> 03:34:52.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AUTISM WHO'S NOW AN ADULT AND I

03:34:53.046 --> 03:34:55.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KNOW THAT PRESCHOOL MADE A HUGE

03:34:55.349 --> 03:34:57.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR HER.

03:34:57.184 --> 03:34:58.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCLUSION THE MORE THAT WE CAN

03:34:58.885 --> 03:35:00.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCLUDE OUR KIDS IN GENERAL AD

03:35:00.320 --> 03:35:02.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR KIDS

03:35:02.155 --> 03:35:04.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE IN GENERAL ADS FIFTY OR MORE

03:35:04.524 --> 03:35:06.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
PERCENT OF THE DAY.

03:35:06.193 --> 03:35:08.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO GIVE

03:35:08.362 --> 03:35:10.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THEM ACCESS TO FIRST BEST

03:35:10.364 --> 03:35:11.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
INSTRUCTION.

03:35:11.698 --> 03:35:12.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEN WE REALLY REALLY NEED

03:35:12.666 --> 03:35:15.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO ADVOCATE FOR THE ID A FUNDS

03:35:15.736 --> 03:35:17.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THAT WE CAN GET AN INCREASE

03:35:17.204 --> 03:35:18.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE SO WE WON'T JUST HAVE TO

03:35:18.272 --> 03:35:19.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEAR IT AS THE STATE. AND I KNOW

03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:21.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

03:35:31.051 --> 03:35:32.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT

03:35:32.352 --> 03:35:34.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ADDITIONAL REVENUES THAT ARE

AND DONT IT CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE

03:43:12.612 --> 03:43:14.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO WAIT TILL FIFTH GRADE I THINK

03:43:14.547 --> 03:43:15.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHEN WE STARTED TO WATCH THAT

EARLIER AGE SO THEY DON'T HAVE
