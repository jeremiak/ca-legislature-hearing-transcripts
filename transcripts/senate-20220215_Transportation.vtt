CHAIR AROUND ALL HIGHLIGHTED

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:10.088
VEHICLE REGULATIONS ARE SETTING

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:11.924
A COURSE FOR ZERO EMISSIONS

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.992
WHEREVER POSSIBLE. IN THE

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:15.093
VEHICLE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.396
IS RESPONDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.398
AND ACROSS THE GLOBE. DAIMLER

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:20.999
TRUCK FOR EXAMPLE HAS SET A GOAL

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.468
THAT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WILL

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:26.071
MAKE UP 60% OF ITS SALES BY

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:27.139
TWENTY THIRTY AND A 100% BY

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:29.341
TWENTY THIRTY NINE. LAST YEAR

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:30.309
EV'S WERE CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:32.277
ONE EXPORT AND CALIFORNIA IS

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:34.580
RANKED NUMBER ONE WHEN IT COMES

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:37.916
TO THAT MANUFACTURING. WE ARE

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:39.017
THE NEW MICHIGAN WHEN IT COMES

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:40.686
TO SAYS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:42.321
CALIFORNIA'S ZERO EMISSION

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:44.890
PASSENGER VEHICLE SALES. EACH

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.825
THE HIGHEST EVER HAD OVER 12%

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:48.694
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.329
PLUG IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:51.630
THREE THOUSAND FUEL CELL

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:52.631
ELECTRIC VEHICLES WERE SOLD LAST

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:55.234
YEAR. AND IN THE LAST QUARTER OF

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:55.801
TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HIT THE

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:57.603
MILESTONE OF HAVING ONE MILLION

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:00.372
SAM SOLD. SO BIG SUBS ARE MORE

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:02.975
NASCENT BUT THAT SECTOR COULD

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.444
ACTUALLY ELECTRIFY FASTER WHEN

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:07.746
THERE'S A STRONG BUSINESS CASE.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.047
WE KNOW THAT LAUGHTER OBSERVE

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:10.582
REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IS A

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.484
MAJOR BARRIER TO LAWS THAT

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:15.220
COMMERCIALIZATION WHETHER THAT'S

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:16.221
FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES ARE BIG

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.457
THAT. AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.225
REQUIRES MY AGENCY TO CONDUCT AN

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.960
ANALYSIS OF TWENTY THIRTY

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:23.929
CHARGER NEEDS AND TO UPDATE THAT

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.697
ANNOUNCES EVERY TWO YEARS. WE

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:27.232
PARTNERED WITH NATIONAL LABS AND

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:29.234
MAJOR UNIVERSITIES TO CONDUCT

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:30.669
THE INAUGURAL REPORT THAT WE

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:43.382
RELEASED LAST YEAR. COMMISSIONER

WHICH WAS SPONSORED BY SENATOR

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:55.327
ARCHULETA AND PASSED INTO LAW

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:56.895
LAST YEAR THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:19:56.962 --> 00:19:58.664
WILL BE CONDUCTING ANNOUNCES OF

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.033
HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:01.600
TWENTY THIRTY FOR MEDIUM AND

ELECTRIC. SO WE HAVE THE

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.549
OPPORTUNITY TO USE THESE BIG

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:19.551
BATTERIES ON WHEELS TO INTEGRATE

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:21.253
RENEWABLES AND SUPPORTED CLEAN

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:29.261
GRID. WE NEED THE EXAMS TO BE.

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.196
THINGS THAT WERE HAVING A BIT OF

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:33.799
WIFI ISSUES BUT I THINK- SORRY

INFRASTRUCTURE WELL I WAS SAYING

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:05.564
THAT HYDROGEN HAS AN IMPORTANT

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:06.932
ROLE TO PLAY AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:08.800
BE DOING AN ANALYSIS OF TWENTY

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.469

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.638
FOR BIG STEPS BUT WE HAVEN'T YET

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:19.645
DONE THAT. AND THAT WILL. SO I'M

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.680
GONNA START. TALKING JUST MORE

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:23.181
DEEPLY ABOUT BATTERY ELECTRIC

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:26.251
VEHICLE REFUELLING. SO WE HAVE

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:28.253
AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE BATTERIES

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.322
TO INTEGRATE RENEWABLES AND HELP

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:32.224
MEET OUR CLEAN GREAT GOALS WE

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.493
NEED BIG SENSE TO BE A GOOD

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.696
CITIZENS OF THE GRANT. ARE AB

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:38.463
TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN REPORT

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.165
FOUND THAT EASY CHARGING FOR BIG

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:44.202
THAT CAN INCREASE LOAD UP 26% IN

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:45.537
TWENTY THIRTY COMPARED WITH

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:46.271
CURRENT STATEWIDE ELECTRICITY

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.607
LOAD. THAT'S A LOT OF FLEXIBLE

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:50.475
LOAD AND WE CAN USE IT FOR SMART

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:53.679
WE CAN USE THAT TO HELP. MAKE

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:54.946
OUR GRID MORE RESILIENT. WHERE

00:21:55.013 --> 00:21:56.715
POSSIBLE WE WANT TO TIME THE

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:58.250
CHARGING A BIG DEBTS TO COINCIDE

00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:00.152
WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:01.720
THE BIG SAYS CAN LITERALLY RUN

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:03.522
ON SUNSHINE. INTEGRATING

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:05.257
RENEWABLES PLUS STORAGE CAN MAKE

00:22:05.323 --> 00:22:07.292
CHARGING COSTS LOWER AND THE

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:09.528
SYSTEM MORE RESILIENT. OUT ONE

00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:10.729
OF THE PROJECTS WE FUNDED THAT

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:12.297
ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IS A

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:13.565
TWENTY FIVE MAKE A LOT PUBLIC

00:22:13.632 --> 00:22:15.801
CHARGING STATION FOR BIG SUBS IN

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:17.536
BAKERSFIELD. THAT INCLUDES A

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:19.971
MICROGRID INTEGRATING SOLAR PLUS

00:22:20.038 --> 00:22:21.573
STORAGE. THERE'S ALSO THE

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.408
POSSIBILITY OF USING BIG SAYS AS

00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:25.577
A SOURCE OF GREAT ENERGY. SO FOR

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:27.212
EXAMPLE WE FUNDED OVER TWO

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.613
HUNDRED ELECTION ELECTRIC SCHOOL

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.115
BUSES WITH THE CAPABILITY TO GET

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:31.817
ELECTRICITY BACK TO THE GRID AT

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:33.351
PEAK TIMES. AND NOW WE'RE

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:35.220
FUNDING PROJECTS TO TRY TO

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:37.756
UNLOCK THAT VALUE. SO A KEY

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:38.990
CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL

00:22:39.057 --> 00:22:40.625
AWARE OF CHARGES IS THAT IT

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:42.394
TAKES A LONG TIME. UNDER THE

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:43.929
BEST CASE IT WOULD TAKE THIRTY

00:22:43.995 --> 00:22:44.963
MINUTES TO REFILL THE VEHICLE

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.264
BUT MORE LIKELY WOULD TAKE MUCH

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:48.533
LONGER COMPARED WITH FIVE TO TEN

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.268
MINUTES FOR DIESEL OR HYDROGEN.

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:51.269
IN ADDITION THERE CAN BE

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:53.038
LOCALIZED DISTRIBUTION LEVEL

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:54.606
IMPACTS TO THE GRID. SO WE NEED

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:56.374
TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY AND ENSURE

00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:59.077
THEIR ENSURE THERE IS CLOSE

00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:01.313
COORDINATION WITH UTILITIES. NOW

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:02.247
LET ME TURN THE HYDROGEN

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:05.317
REFUELLING FOR- EXISTENCE. SO

00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:07.919
LIKE CHARGING HYDROGEN FOR FUEL

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.688
CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES PRESENTS

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:10.388
OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS

00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:12.457
CHALLENGES. ADVANTAGES INCLUDE

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:15.060
OR DESELECT REVEALING EXPERIENCE

00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:16.962
LONGER RANGE AND A LIGHTER

00:23:17.028 --> 00:23:18.063
WEIGHT SO TRUCKERS CAN HAUL MORE

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.798
GOODS. THESE ADVANTAGES ARE

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:21.933
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN IT

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.301
COMES TO LONG HAUL TRUCKS. THE

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:25.570
CHALLENGE AGAIN I THINK THIS IS

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:27.239
NO SURPRISE THERE'S A LACK OF

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:29.274
REFUELLING INFRASTRUCTURE. SO

00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:30.275
TWO YEARS AGO THE ENERGY

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:31.910
COMMISSION EXPANDED OUR PUBLIC

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:33.845
HYDROGEN STATION INVESTMENTS TO

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.180
INCLUDE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.116
VEHICLES. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:39.151
SHOULD GIVE US SUFFICIENT

00:23:39.217 --> 00:23:40.752
FUNDING TO REACH THE STATE'S

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:50.629
GOAL OF HAVING TWO HUNDRED.

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:51.763
WE'RE ALSO FUNDING DEEPER

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.698
REVEALING TO SUPPORT SIX

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.200
HYDROGEN REFUELING STATIONS FOR

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:57.235
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES.

00:23:57.302 --> 00:23:58.637
WITH THE FUELING CAPABILITY TO

00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:00.539
SERVE ABOUT EIGHTY CLASS EIGHT

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.175
FUEL CELL DRAYAGE TRUCKS ABOUT

00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:03.742
FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:05.443
TRANSIT BUSES AT ABOUT TEN

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.646
LOCOMOTIVES. AS OF TODAY THE

00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:08.747
ENERGY COMMISSION CLEAN

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:10.182
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.017
INVESTED A LITTLE OVER TWO

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:13.084
HUNDRED MILLION IN HYDROGEN

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:14.619
REFUELLING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

00:24:14.686 --> 00:24:16.288
LIGHT MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:18.456
VEHICLES. CALIFORNIA HAS

00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:20.058
INVESTED MORE IN HYDROGEN

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.393
REFUELLING INFRASTRUCTURE THAN

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:23.662
ANY NATION IN THE WORLD SAVE TO

00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:25.430
PAM. BESIDES A LACK OF

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:27.065
INFRASTRUCTURE OTHER CHALLENGES

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:28.700
INCLUDE READING THE HYDROGEN

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.502
SUPPLY DRIVING DOWN THE COST OF

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:33.138
HYDROGEN. HYDROGEN SOURCED

00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:36.575
SHORTAGES AND STATION DOWNTIME

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:37.709
DUE TO THE NASCENT NATURE OF THE

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:39.244
TECHNOLOGY. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:41.079
PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES A

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:41.646
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:43.849
GREEN HYDROGEN WHICH WOULD BE A

00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:45.150
NO REGRETS INVESTMENTS THAT

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:46.651
WOULD ALLOW US TO EXPLORE HOW TO

00:24:46.718 --> 00:24:48.053
SCALE GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:50.255
FOR TRANSPORTATION BUT ALSO FOR

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:52.224
ENERGY STORAGE AND OTHER. AND

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.093
OTHER PURPOSES. SO FINALLY I

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.995
WANT TO ADDRESS NATURAL GAS.

00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:58.230
ENERGY COMMISSION'S CLEAN

00:24:58.296 --> 00:24:59.431
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS A

00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:01.633
LONG HISTORY OF FUNDING NATURAL

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.267
GAS VEHICLES NAMES AND

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:03.935
INFRASTRUCTURE. IN FACT WE

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:06.004
FUNDED IT FOR ELEVEN YEARS- FROM

00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:06.938
THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:10.508
UNTIL- FISCAL YEAR TWENTY

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:11.042
EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN.

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:12.277
NATURAL GAS THAT'S BEEN A

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.412
CLEANER ALTERNATIVE TO DIESEL%

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:15.347
AND IT'S HELPED PUSH DIESEL TO

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:17.449
GET CLEANER. WHILE DEMONSTRATE

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:19.050
INDUSTRY THAT ALTERNATIVE FUELS

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:21.586
CAN CA PERFORM JUST AS WELL AS

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:23.688
DIESEL. BUT NOW IS YOUR RENTAL

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:24.856
HIGHLIGHTED WE HAVE THIS

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:26.157
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEED THE

00:25:26.224 --> 00:25:27.592
TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.594
TRANSPORTATION. WE'VE HEARD FROM

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:31.196
MANY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:32.931
THOSE REPRESENTING LOW INCOME

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:34.432
AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:35.467
THAT ARE FUNDING SHOULD BE

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:37.335
FOCUSED ON ZERO MISSION AND THAT

00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:39.104
IT SHOULD PROVIDE TANGIBLE

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.374
DIRECT BENEFITS TO COMMUNITIES.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.842
THE CARD THE BILL'S REGULATIONS

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:45.043
THAT SET A COURSE FOR ZERO

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.778
EMISSION MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

00:25:46.845 --> 00:25:48.079
VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT ARE

00:25:48.146 --> 00:25:49.514
FUNDING PROGRAMS PRESENT

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:52.117
INTEREST JUNCTURE ARE HELPING

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:53.518
INDUSTRY REACH THOSE TARGETS.

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:54.786
AND WE'RE STRIVING TO FUTURE

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:56.454
PROOF PUBLIC INVESTMENTS AND

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:57.455
SUPPORT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:25:57.522 --> 00:25:59.724
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY

00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:02.627
HARMFUL TAILPIPE POLLUTION. SO

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:04.029
IN CONCLUSION I WANT TO

00:26:04.095 --> 00:26:06.932
EMPHASIZE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:07.532
TO ZERO OUT EMISSIONS FOR OUR

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:09.401
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS WITHIN

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:12.037
SIGHT. I'VE BEEN IN THE CLEAN

00:26:12.103 --> 00:26:13.204
TRANSPORTATION SPACE FOR TWENTY

00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:14.639
FIVE YEARS AND I'M MORE

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:16.074
CONFIDENT TODAY THAN I HAVE EVER

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:18.510
BEEN THAT THE FUTURE IS YOUR

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:20.345
MISSION. BUT I'M ALSO CLEAR I

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:21.713
THAT THERE ARE MAJOR CHALLENGES

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.815
TO OVERCOME INCLUDING A LACK OF

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.750
ZEBRA FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:26.851
THE BUILD OUT OF THAT REVEALING

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:28.086
INFRASTRUCTURE IS A CRITICAL

00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:30.288
COMPONENT TO ENSURING CALIFORNIA

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:32.157
CAN MEET OUR TARGETS. AND TO

00:26:32.223 --> 00:26:33.458
SUPPORT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:35.193
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.429
HARMFUL POLLUTION. SO THANK YOU

00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:38.596
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:40.098
QUESTIONS AND YOUR COMMENTS

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:42.033
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:42.634

IN TODAY'S. HEARING IN MY BRIEF

00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:10.228
TIME HERE I DO JUST WANT TO

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.163
HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY QUESTIONS

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.298
AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:15.000
COMMITTEE AS IT EXPLORES. THE

00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:17.002
ISSUE OF HEAVY DUTY EMISSIONS

00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:18.436
AND THIS HEARING AND BEYOND SO

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:19.971
I'M JUST GONNA LOOK- JUMP INTO

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:23.308
THOSE THREE. KEY ISSUES AND

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:24.242
QUESTIONS NOW SO FIRST. WE THINK

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.643
IT'S IMPORTANT- TO REMEMBER THE

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.145
HEAVY DUTY IN OFF ROAD VEHICLES

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:29.748
REALLY DO INCLUDE A DIVERSE MIX

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:30.648
OF VEHICLES EQUIPMENT AND

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:33.151
TECHNOLOGIES. BUT NOT LIKE A

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:34.853
LIGHT DUTY PASSENGER CARS WHERE-

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:35.987
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE SIMILAR

00:27:36.054 --> 00:27:37.188
TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICE SIMILAR

00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:50.969
PURPOSE. AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE.

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:52.003
DIFFERENT STAGES OF

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.872
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT- AND

00:27:53.938 --> 00:27:55.106
AT THE END OF THAT TECHNOLOGICAL

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:56.074
DEVELOPMENT COULD BE DIFFERENT

00:27:56.141 --> 00:27:58.043
BETWEEN A TRANSIT BUS FOR

00:27:58.109 --> 00:27:59.511
EXAMPLE AND LONG HAUL TRUCKS.

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:00.612
ARE SO AS A RESULT THE

00:28:00.678 --> 00:28:02.514
CHALLENGES AND APPROPRIATE STATE

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.115
PROGRAMS AND POLICIES MIGHT

00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:06.317
DIFFER DRAMATICALLY AND SO- THEM

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:08.420
IT'S NOT REALLY A KIND OF ONE

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:10.021
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH- THE

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:12.223
SECOND. QUESTION AND I WANTED TO

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.825
HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE- IS

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:15.760
KIND OF THIS QUESTION ABOUT-

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:17.495
TECHNOLOGY INCOME WHEN TO BE

00:28:17.562 --> 00:28:19.631
TECHNOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL IN WHEN

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:20.665
TO PUSH SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:22.167
THAT. MIGHT APPEAR MORE

00:28:22.233 --> 00:28:23.902
PROMISING SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:26.171
HYDROGEN AND BATTERY ELECTRIC OR

00:28:26.237 --> 00:28:28.106
BOTH AND SO. UNFORTUNATELY I

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.641
THINK THERE'S NOT A SIMPLE

00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:31.876
ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION A DOZEN

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:32.644
BALLS- SOME TRADE OFFS AND

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.712
JUDGMENT. IN GENERAL IN THE

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:36.448
EARLY STAGES ARE WE THINK.

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:37.916
TECHNOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL

00:28:37.982 --> 00:28:38.550
APPROACHES CAN GIVE AN

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.151
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- THE BEST

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:42.120
TECHNOLOGY TO WIN- MAKES SENSE

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:44.556
HOWEVER THE DOES. IN MANY CASES

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:46.124
COME A POINT WHERE IT MIGHT NOT

00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:47.392
MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE TO INVEST

00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:48.760
IN AND THOSE TECH CERTAIN

00:28:48.827 --> 00:28:50.628
TECHNOLOGIES ANYMORE AND SO.

00:28:50.695 --> 00:28:51.563
AGAIN I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:52.797
ANSWER BUT WE DO THINK THIS IS

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:54.866
A- KEY QUESTION FOR THE

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:55.567
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AND

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:56.835
PERHAPS. THAT'S THE

00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.303
ADMINISTRATION OTHER PANELISTS

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:02.440
IN THIS. HEARING AT WHAT POINT

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:03.942
DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO FOCUS ON

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:04.576
SPECIFIC TECH. HOW DO I HOW DO

00:29:04.642 --> 00:29:06.811
AGE ABOUT THIS ISSUE OR CRITERIA

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:09.280
DID THEY USE. AND WHAT METRICS-

00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:10.348
TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:13.017
INTEREST US US. THE THIRD AND

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.487
FINAL QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO.

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:18.523
HIGHLIGHT IS WHICH BUDGET ITEMS.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.858
MIGHT THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:20.959
PRIORITIZE IN THIS AREA AND

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:22.794
AGAIN THIS MATERIAL WHERE THERE

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:23.728
ARE SOME IMPORTANT TRADE OFFS TO

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:26.364
CONSIDER. SO THERE'S REALLY

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.066
THREE MAIN TYPES OF. HEAVY DUTY

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:29.767
VEHICLE PROGRAMS THERE'S

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:30.502
RETIREMENT AND REPLACEMENT

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:32.871
PROGRAMS LIKE THE KERR MOYER

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:34.372
PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WITH.

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.608
CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES ARE CLEANER

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:39.544
ENGINES WHICH TENDS TO BE IN A

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.412
MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.148
NEAR TERM AIR POLLUTION

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:44.782
REDUCTIONS. THERE'S HEAVY DUTY

00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:46.551
ON OR OFF-ROAD VOUCHERS LIKE

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:48.486
THAT EACH STEP PROGRAM WHICH

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:50.021
OFTEN GO TO ZERO EMISSION

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:52.056
TECHNOLOGIES. WHICH APPEARS TO

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.825
BECOME A MORE COST EFFECTIVE IN

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:55.727
THE NEAR TERM FOR GREENHOUSE GAS

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:57.629
REDUCTIONS. AND THERE'S PILOTS

00:29:57.695 --> 00:29:59.297
AND DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH- DO

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:00.899
MORE TO ADVANCE THEIR EMISSION

00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:02.901
TECHNOLOGIES. WHICH CAN HAVE

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:04.502
RELATED MORE LONGER TERM

00:30:04.569 --> 00:30:06.371
BENEFITS IN TERMS OF GHGS AND-

00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:07.472
POLLUTION BUT MIGHT BE MORE

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:09.307
COSTLY IN THE NEAR TERM AND SO

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:10.608
THIS IS REALLY KIND OF LIKE A

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:11.743
KEY DECISION. FOR THE

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.178
LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO PRIORITIZE

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:14.979
AMONG THESE DIFFERENT GOALS WHEN

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.080
A GERMAN IN ITS BUDGET

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:17.882
ALLOCATIONS AND LARGELY DEPENDS

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:19.551
ON. THE LEGISLATORS POLICY

00:30:19.617 --> 00:30:22.320
PRIORITIES AND HOW IT BOUNCES.

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:25.023
SHORT TERM REDUCTIONS WITH A

00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:27.392
LONGER TERM- DEEPER REDUCTIONS

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:34.666
IN THERE G. H. I WILL IN MY

00:30:34.732 --> 00:30:37.168
COMMENTS AMONG THE TENS OF. HELP

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:37.869

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:11.903
LARGEST AIR DISTRICT IN THE

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.605
NATION. IN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW

00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:14.706
WE SUFFER FROM THE WORST AIR

00:31:14.772 --> 00:31:16.608
QUALITY IN THE NATION MOSTLY DUE

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:19.177
TO MOBILE SOURCES. OF WHICH WE

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:19.944
HAVE ALMOST NO REGULATORY

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:21.746
AUTHORITY WE'RE ALSO HOME TO

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:24.282
NEARLY 67% OF ALL ENVIRONMENTAL

JUSTICE COMMUNITIES IN THE

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:26.918
STATE. AND OUR FAILURE TO MEET

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.319
THE IMPENDING EPA STANDARDS FOR

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:30.021
CLEAN AIR NOT ONLY RESULTS IN

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.789
UNHEALTHY AIR FOR ALL OF OUR

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:33.591
RESIDENTS. BUT COULD RESULT IN

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:35.827
EBAY SANCTIONS TO CUT BILLIONS

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:36.728
OF DOLLARS IN TRANSPORTATION

00:31:36.794 --> 00:31:38.763
FUNDING. INCREASE COSTS FOR

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.598
LOCAL BUSINESSES TO THE TUNE OF

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.166
ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY MILLION

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.434
DOLLARS AN INCREASE PERMANENT

00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:45.203
FEES. AND THE POTENTIAL FEDERAL

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.839
GO OVER OUR ERROR EFFORT. NEVER

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:49.974
MET THAT'S HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS IN

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.409
THE STATE OR DIESEL AND ABOUT

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:53.311
HALF OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:54.512
THOUSAND OR SO OUR INNER BASIN.

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:56.381
I JUST WANT TO CLEAR THAT WE

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:57.582
FOUR ZERO MISSION TRIP

00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:59.250
TECHNOLOGIES ARE AS A-

00:31:59.317 --> 00:31:59.817
COMMISSION MONAHAN SAID BIG

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:02.387
SAM'S- AND IN FACT WERE RUNNING

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:03.521
THE MOST ADVANCED PROJECTS IN

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:08.693
THE STATE IF NOT THE NATION ON.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.598
ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY TRUCK.

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:15.266
APOLOGIES MATTER KNOWLEDGE AND

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:18.169
TECHNIQUE ESTIMATE. IN THE NEXT-

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:19.837
TO GET TO THE VOLUMES THAT ARE

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:21.372
NECESSARY FOR US TO REPLACE

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:23.508
THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS

00:32:23.574 --> 00:32:24.275
FIFTY THOUSAND HER THOUSAND

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:26.010
TRUCKS IT'LL TAKE ABOUT FIVE TO

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:27.645
TEN YEARS AND THAT'S JUST TO GET

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:29.113
THE BATTERY OPTIMIZATION RIGHT

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.448
IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:31.983
COMMISSION ONE HAD MENTIONED

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.351
THAT IN HEAVY DUTY FUEL CELL

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:35.653
TRUCKS OR EVEN FURTHER OUT JUST

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.421
BECAUSE WE'RE STARTING

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:38.256
DEMONSTRATION DOES TODAY.

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:39.290
INFRASTRUCTURE GRID SUPPORT

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:41.159
REMAINS CRITICAL A QUESTIONS FOR

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.960
BOTH OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES BUT

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:44.562
THE SAD FACT IS OUR COMMUNITIES

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:46.130
NEED CLEANER NOW THE NEAR ZERO

00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:47.598
NATURAL GAS ENGINES THAT WE HELP

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.667
DEVELOP WITH THE ENERGY

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:50.835
COMMISSION. ARE COMMERCIALIZED

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:53.504
TODAY THERE 90% CLEAR FOR KNOX

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:55.573
AND THEY HAVE ZERO A CARCINOGEN

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.176
CARCINOGENIC DIESEL PARTS THAT

00:32:58.242 --> 00:33:00.111
ARE- WHICH IT CAN USE THAT

00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:02.013
JURADO SHOWN HER MAPS THE

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.614
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE BY ALL

00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:05.083
THE DOMESTIC TRUCK MANUFACTURES

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:06.417
THE TWO TO THREE TIMES LESS

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:07.719
EXPENSIVE THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:09.620
TRUCKS ARE BIG JOBS AND

00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:10.788
THEREFORE TO FIVE TIMES

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:14.559
EXPENSIVE. THAN HYDROGEN FUEL

00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:15.126
CELL TRUCKS. SO INDEPENDENT

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:16.994
OWNER ON. NEED A FOR. CLEANER

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.730
OPTIONS OR THEY'RE JUST GONNA BY

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:20.565
USE DIESEL TRUCKS AND CONTINUE

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:22.266
TO DO SO. I JUST WANT TO BE

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:23.334
CLEAR THAT NEAR ZERO EMISSION

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:24.736
TRUCKS OF FOR YOUR PLACE TODAY.

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:26.204
THEY'RENOT PERMANENT RIGHT IT'S

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.805
NOT A DEAD END WE'RE GOING AFTER

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:29.340
PLACES TRUCKS ANOTHER SEVEN TO

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:30.808
TEN YEARS AND BY THAT TIME.

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.577
THEY'LL GO TO ZERO EMISSIONS BUT

00:33:32.643 --> 00:33:34.011
IN THE NEAR TERM WE SHOULD BE

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:35.747
REPLACING THESE DIESEL TRUCKS.

00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:37.482
WITH 90% CLEANER TRUCKS TO HELP

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:39.150
IMPROVE REGIONAL AIR QUALITY AS

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:41.652
A AS A- IN ADDITION TO REMOVING

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:43.654
TOXIC STORE COMMUNITIES. SO LET

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:45.089
ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING.

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:46.724
UNFORTUNATELY WE CANNOT REGULATE

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.192
OUR WAY OUT OF THIS IMPENDING

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:50.561
CLEAN AIR CRISIS WE JUST DON'T

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:51.929
HAVE ENOUGH TIME ALL THE

00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:53.765
SWEETER. AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE

00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:54.365
REGULATIONS ENSURE ROUND OF

00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:56.200
SHOTS. THAT SHOW THOSE AREN'T

00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:57.435
GOING TO TAKE EFFECT ON TWENTY

00:33:57.502 --> 00:33:58.703
TWENTY SEVEN. SO WE NEED TO

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.638
REPLACE DIESEL TRUCKS TODAY AND

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:01.939
WE BELIEVE THAT USING YOURS OR

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:04.208
NATURAL GAS. WORKS IN CONCERT

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:06.144
WITH ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. SO WE

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.512
NEED INCENTIVES FOR NEAR

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.247
TERMINUS REDUCTIONS WE BELIEVE

00:34:09.313 --> 00:34:10.715
THAT SOME OF THAT BUDGET SURPLUS

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:11.749
SHOULD BE GOING TOWARD AND

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:13.418
CERTIFICATION FROM THE- A CHANGE

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:15.386

TO BE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR OF

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:41.005
EMISSIONS THAT IMPACT OUR HEALTH

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:42.607
BASED IN STANDARDS. OF THESE

00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:43.808
MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS MEDIUM

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.443
AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.645
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS.

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:48.746

GOALS. IMPLEMENTING YOUR ZERO

00:35:58.823 --> 00:35:59.857
TECHNOLOGY ZERO AREAS ARE MET

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:01.926
WITH MULTIPLE DIFFICULTIES.

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:03.327
MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY EASY

00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:04.862
INFRASTRUCTURE IS RARE TO

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:06.797
NONEXISTENT RURAL AREAS. THREE

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:07.999
IN A ROW AREAS CAN SIGNIFICANT

00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:11.168
REDUCED RANGE OF CURRENT ZERO

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.303
EMISSION TECHNOLOGY. AS AN

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.305
ANECDOTAL EXAMPLE I LIVE IN

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:16.207
REDDING CALIFORNIA IF I DRIVE MY

FORTY FIVE FIFTY MILES OF RANGE.

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:28.586
A TOUGH OF OUR- BILLETE

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:30.154

COMMON WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:36.561
INFRASTRUCTURE RURAL AREAS IS

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:39.597
OFTEN THE LAST VEHICLE. OTHER

00:36:39.664 --> 00:36:41.933
CONCERNS YOUR ABILITY ZERO

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:42.900
EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES ARE

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.269
CRITICAL. OVER EVERYTHING VALLEY

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:46.537
COMMUNITIES HAVE SEEN A

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:51.409
REDUCTION IN. IN THIS

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:52.843
COMMUNITIES CONTINGENCY NEEDS

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:56.547
SEVERAL MULTI DAY WE CHARACTERS.

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:57.682
THREE THE REASON EXAMPLES YOU

FIVE IN MINERAL HEALTH. I

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:12.897
RECOMMEND THE STATE'S SUPPORT

IN THE DEMAND WERE YOU CASES.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.012
IT'S TIME FOR INFRASTRUCTURE TO

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.680
. EXPAND THE ROOT COMMUNITY.

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.449
ADDITION THE FOR NEIGHBOR

THE BILLABLE TORNADOES ABOUT. TO

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:50.801
EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE TAKE TO

00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:53.938
SAY EXISTING BIOMASS. RESOURCES

OUR FIRST PANEL MAY ARE THAT

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:26.937
CLEAN. TECH BY EACH OF OUR STATE

00:38:27.004 --> 00:38:29.540
AGENCIES AND LOCAL- AIR QUALITY

MAKE THIS QUICK MADAM CHAIR I AM

00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:43.254
GOING TO SERIES OF QUESTIONS HOW

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.357
MANY. HEAVY DUTY OR BIG RIG ZERO

00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:49.193
EMISSION TRUCKS OR ON THE ROAD

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.495
TODAY. AND THEN I'LL JUST

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:54.432
THROUGH THE CHAIR- IT WHAT RATE

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:55.499
DO YOU EXPECT THAT THEY'LL

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:57.668
REPLACE THE CURRENT FLEET OF

00:38:57.735 --> 00:39:01.205
DIESEL TRUCKS. AND THEN- WHAT IS

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.040
THE PROJECTIONS FOR THESE BIG

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:06.243
RIGS ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS BY

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.879
TWENTY THIRTY. OKAY LET

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.781
ALTERNATELY WHAT IS THAT ALL

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:12.616
BASED ON AND I'M I'M TRYING TO

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:14.185
GET A FEELING OF WHAT WHAT OUR

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:17.588
PLAN IS AND- HOW THAT ALL WORKS

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:20.024
. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SO I

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:20.991
DON'T KNOW WHO'D LIKE TO START

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:22.727
OFF- I KNOW TO RANDOLPH IS STILL

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:25.863
HERE SO I SEE HER AND NEEDING GO

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.431
RIGHT AHEAD. THE THREE QUESTIONS

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:29.200
THEY ARE CURRENTLY ON THE ROAD

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:30.935
IN TERMS OF HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS.

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:32.703
WHAT IS THE STRATEGY FOR DIESEL

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.939
REPLACEMENT AND THEN PROJECTIONS

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:37.808
BY TWENTY THIRTY. SURE SO I

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:39.043
DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR THE

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.344
ACTUAL NUMBER OF VEHICLES ON THE

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:41.946
ROAD I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE

00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:44.582
ARE NUMEROUS MODELS AVAILABLE ON

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:46.083
THE MARKET AND I THINK IT'S

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.686
IMPORTANT TO- SORT OF TALK ABOUT

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:51.889
THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE USE CASE-

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:54.091
WITH THERE ARE MANY MEDIUM AND

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:55.793
HEAVY DUTY ZERO EMISSION

00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.598
VEHICLES AVAILABLE. TODAY AND SO

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:02.099
THE RIVER A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:03.567
THINK TO THEMSELVES OH WELL I

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:05.436
CAN'T ICTURE THIS TRUCK DRIVING

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:07.638
TO MONTANA BUT MY POINT IS IN

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:11.342
MANY MANY MANY CASES THEY DON'T

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.677
NEED TO DRIVE TO MONTANA. 63% OF

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:15.045
THE TRACTOR TRAILERS IN THE

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:17.615
STATE TRAVEL UNDER TWO HUNDRED

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:19.583
MILES. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.486
USE CASES NEAR COURT- HAND AT

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:26.724
WAREHOUSES- AND THE SHORTER HAUL

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:28.392
THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:30.728
IS THEIR EMISSION VEHICLES. ON

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:32.863
IN THOSE SECTORS- AND THEY CAN

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.666
BE USED- FOR DRAINAGE AND FOR

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:38.936
OTHER SHORT HAUL- AND- ACTIVITY

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:41.405
AND OF COURSE- YOU KNOW DELIVERY

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:44.842
VANS- SMALLER AND MEDIUM AND

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:46.911
HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. I HAVE THE

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:50.447
OPPORTUNITY TO- ACQUIRES A

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:51.782
REMISSION TECHNOLOGY AND

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:54.652
ELECTRIFIED THOSE ROUTES WELL SO

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:56.353
WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.622
ABOUT THE VARIETY OF USE CASES

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:01.458
THAT CAN GO TO ZERO EMISSION-

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:03.093
IMMEDIATELY AS WE ARE MOVING

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:09.300
MORE TOWARDS- OUR- AT. TWENTY

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:10.267
THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:13.337
GOALS. THANK YOU AT CHER

00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:15.606
RANDOLPH WE APPRECIATE THAT ENDS

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:17.875
NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.777
CAN'T FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DOLLY.

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:22.346
YEAH I WAS READING TODAY'S CREAM

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:24.215
BLOOMBERG GREEN REPORT THEY'VE

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:27.751
GOT. ARTICLE BY ASHOT RAFI WHICH

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:29.854
TALKS ABOUT UNDERESTIMATING THE

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.656
IMPACTS OF METHANE AND BASICALLY

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:34.692
SEBERG STANFORD GROUP HAS COME

00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:36.627
UP I'M SURE THE MEMBERS OF CAR

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:38.362
BREAK. THEN THE ENERGY

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:40.865
COMMISSION UNDERSTAND THE

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:42.199
HUNDRED YEAR HORIZON THAT WE

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:44.235
LOOK AT FOR REDUCING CARBON AND

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:46.036
THEY SUGGESTED WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:47.771
METHANE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.640
A TWENTY YEAR HORIZON TO

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:52.076
RECALCULATE. THOSE THOSE

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:54.645
BENEFITS PARTICULARLY IF OUR

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.981
GOAL IS TO REDUCE. THE

00:41:57.047 --> 00:41:58.949
TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH OF THE

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:00.751
RISING TEMPERATURE TO ONE POINT

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:02.720
FIVE DEGREES AS SET FORTH IN THE

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:05.022
PARIS ACCORD RATHER THAN JUST

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:09.226
GETTING TWO ZERO- DINNER ZERO BY

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:10.461
TWENTY FORTY OF THE SHORT TERM

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:15.332
GOAL. IS THAT SO WITH THAT IN

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:16.867
MIND. THEN GIVEN THAT THE SOUTH

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:18.602
IS URGING. THE USE OF A NEW.

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:22.673
NATURAL GAS TO MEET OUR HEATING

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.742
CONCERNS AND ALSO GET THE

00:42:24.808 --> 00:42:28.412
PARTICULAR. REDUCTIONS ISN'T. A

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.381
RECALCULATION NECESSARY GIVEN

00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:32.016
THIS NEW SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION

00:42:32.082 --> 00:42:33.717
ABOUT THE TWENTY YEAR HORIZON

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:35.719
VERSES THE HUNDRED YEAR HORIZON

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.621
AS FAR AS THE PRIORITIES OF THE-

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:42.293
CARB. IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION.

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:45.462
YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS.

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:47.398
A SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:49.900
WITH- WITH SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:54.805
IMPACTS AND TACKLING METHANE-

00:42:54.872 --> 00:43:01.078
EMISSIONS IS A KEY PILLAR OF- SB

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:02.212
THREE THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND-

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:04.214
OF OUR OVERALL CLIMATE EFFORTS

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:05.950
AND- AND I THINK IT REALLY

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:07.051
HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:09.286
GETTING HIS HEARING MISSION-

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:11.789
BECAUSE FOSSIL FUELS HAVE

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:14.858
METHANE AND WE NEED TO GET TO-

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.493
TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS. NOTHING

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.698
ON OUR CLIMATE. I'M SORRY CAN

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:21.932
MAKE A COMMENT THIS IS MATT FROM

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:24.835
THE SOUTH COAST. RIGHT BUT WE

00:43:24.902 --> 00:43:26.904
HAD ENCOURAGE MORE A GREATER.

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:28.439
INVESTMENT INTO RENEWABLE

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:30.207
NATURAL GAS IS THE QUESTION I

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.276
GUESS I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.545
WITH METHANE BUT SOUTH COAST IS

00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:36.747
ARGUING THAT IN THE NEAR TERM TO

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:38.482
GET THE PARTICULATE MATTERS DOWN

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:41.051
INTO. HANDLE THE HEAT THE RISING

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:43.087
HEAT. RIGHT WE MAY COMPROMISE

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:45.289
OUR TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS BUT

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:46.757
WILL REACH THE GOAL OF THE

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:48.092
PROMISE OF PARIS IS THAT THE

00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:49.326
TEMPERATURE OF THE WORLD WILL

00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:52.863
NOT. EXPAND EVER INCREASING

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:53.864
ABOVE ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:55.833
CENTIGRADE. IN CENTER BY CASCADE

00:43:55.899 --> 00:43:58.369
BELIEVE A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE

00:43:58.435 --> 00:44:00.070
OFFICER MISATO WANTED TO JUMP IN

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:01.772
BUT I KNOW CHAPTER RANDOLPH ALSO

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:05.042
IS NEEDED AS WELL SO. BUT EITHER

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:06.477
OF YOU LIKE TO CHIME IN ON THIS

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:07.945
. I'LL JUST BRIEFLY NOTE THAT

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:10.214
YOU KNOW CAPTURING METHANE- FROM

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.216
THINGS LIKE LANDFILLS IS A

00:44:12.282 --> 00:44:13.517
CRITICAL PART OF OUR OVERALL

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:15.386
STRATEGY AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.588
USES FOR THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL

00:44:17.654 --> 00:44:19.256
GAS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD X.

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.558
THE EXPLORING. BUT I THINK AS AS

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:23.560
TECHNOLOGY INVOLVES WE NEED TO

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:25.162
BE UNDERSTANDING WHETHER

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:26.597
TRANSPORTATION IS REALLY THE

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:29.133
PLACE FOR THAT OR IF OTHER USES

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:31.535
OR THE PLACE FOR THAT. YEAH AND

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:33.170
I KNOW THAT COMMISSIONER MONAHAN

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:34.838
AND HER AGENCY DOES A LOT OF THE

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:36.473
G. SHE MODELING I JUST WANTED.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.475
TO ADD THAT WE GET THE RENEWABLE

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:41.612
METHANE. AS A LONG TERM SOLUTION

00:44:41.678 --> 00:44:43.047
AS I MENTIONED IT'S A SHORT TERM

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:44.314
SOLUTION UNTIL ZERO EMISSIONS

00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:46.583
BECOME FULLY AVAILABLE. AND JUST

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.519
TO ADD TO RESPOND CENTER DOTS

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:52.189
QUESTION BUT THERE'S LESS THAN A

00:44:52.256 --> 00:44:53.190
HUNDRED ZERO MISSION BAY EXAMS

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:55.426
ON THE ROAD TODAY. THANK YOU HE

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:57.628
SAID THANK YOU- SO APPRECIATE

00:44:57.694 --> 00:45:00.831
THAT- DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:03.033
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR WHAT

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.168
HOUSE HE WILL GO ON TO SENATOR

00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:06.537
DELHI. THANK YOU MADAM THANK YOU

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.238
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- MY QUESTION

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:10.274
IS FOR CHAIR RAND OFF FIRST I

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.543
WANT TO JUST. BACK UP TO TWO

00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:13.911
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE HAD A

00:45:13.977 --> 00:45:14.845
EXECUTIVE ORDER BY GOVERNOR

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.514
BROWN. WHICH WAS FIVE MILLION

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:19.116
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:20.951
ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY WITH THAT

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:23.520
EXECUTIVE ORDER IN SEVENTY NINE

00:45:23.587 --> 00:45:24.755
TWENTY BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM.

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:26.490
STATUS IN A STATE LIKE ALL THE

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.725
100% OF IN STATE SALES OF NEW

00:45:28.792 --> 00:45:30.761
PASSENGER ARS AND TRUCKS. WILL

00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:31.929
BE ZERO EMISSIONS BY TWENTY

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:33.564
THIRTY FIVE. AND AT A HUNDRED

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:35.666
PERCENT. OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY

00:45:35.732 --> 00:45:39.002
DUTY VEHICLES. WITH ZERO

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:40.237
EMISSIONS BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE.

00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:41.271
WITH DRIED STRUCK TO MEETING

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:42.873
THAT GOAL BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.608
SO THOSE ARE EXECUTIVE ORDERS.

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:46.043
THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THE

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:50.581
LAST TWO GOVERNORS. WE HAVE THE

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.950
- WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OFF-

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:54.818
DIABLO CANYON WHICH IS THREE

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:57.154
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ENERGY IN

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:59.389
CALIFORNIA WE DON'T COUNT LARGE

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:02.626
HYDRO. IN RENEWABLE RESOURCES SO

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:05.429
MY QUESTION IS. IF WE'RE GOING

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:07.498
TO PUT FIVE MILLION JUST THE

00:46:07.564 --> 00:46:08.765
FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER FIVE

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:09.700
MILLION CARS ON THE ROAD IS

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.368
GOING TO INCREASE OUR NEED OF

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:15.038
ELECTRICITY. USAGE FROM ABOUT

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:18.542
FIVE TO SEVEN. SENT A SINGLE

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:22.412
FAST CHARGER FOR EIGHTY- TWO

00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:23.447
FOUR TRUCKS WILL DRAW

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:25.082
ELECTRICITY IN THE AMOUNT OF

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:27.417
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED HOMES OR COULD

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:29.253
BE HIGHER ADDING CHARGING DEEP

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:31.021
OIL TEN TEN TO TWENTY CHARGERS

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.456
WOULD BE LIKE ADDING A SMALL

00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:33.624
CITY SO MY QUESTION IS IF WE

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:35.659
HAVE ONLY A HUNDRED. WE HAVE

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:37.728
LESS THAN A HUNDRED ELECTRIC THE

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:39.363
TRUCK VEHICLES RIGHT NOW AND WE

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:43.967
NEED TO GET AROUND. FIFTY

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:45.903
THOUSAND. OUR HOUSE OUR GRID.

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:47.404
GOING TO SUPPLY THE ELECTRICITY

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:50.874
THAT WE NEED. BY TWENTY THIRTY

00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:51.808
FIVE THAT'S FOURTEEN YEARS FROM

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:56.113
NOW. WHAT DID SHE AROUND UP

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.714
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT IF I TOOK

00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:00.250
THIS QUESTION SO CENTER DOLLY-

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:01.351
THIS IS PATTY MOUNTAIN ENERGY

00:47:01.418 --> 00:47:03.220
COMMISSION AND- IT'S A GREAT

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:04.988
QUESTION AND IT'S ONE THAT WE

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:06.890
HAVE WRESTLED WITH- BOTH WE ARE

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:09.793
WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNER

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.295
IN ENERGY AGENCIES AND THE AIR

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:13.297
RESOURCES BOARD IN DOING A

00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:15.265
REGULAR ANALYSIS- DEMAND

00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:17.301
FORECAST OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:18.735
NEED. NOT JUST FOR

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:20.037
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION

00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:21.838
SIR BUT MORE BROADLY ACROSS ALL

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:24.541
OF OUR SECTORS AND THE THIS IS A

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:26.243
VERY ROBUST ANALYSIS WE WANT TO

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.813
MAKE SURE THAT AS WE- YOU KNOW

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.317
SET TARGETS THAT THE GRID IS

00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:35.118
READY. AND I THINK WE'RE ALL

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:37.221
WORRIED YOU KNOW THAT IF IT'S

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:38.622
BEEN A ROUGH RIDE THE LAST

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:39.556
COUPLE OF YEARS AND ENERGY

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.758
AGENCIES HAVE REALLY WORKED

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:44.161
TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT GOING

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:46.897
FORWARD. I HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:48.165
OF PROCUREMENTS TO BE ABLE TO

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:51.301
MEET THE INCREASED NEED ON THE

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:53.470
GRID FOR TRESPASS LETTER CATION

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:54.671
BUILDING LET'S CREATION AND

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:57.507
OTHER PURPOSES- I WOULD ALSO

00:47:57.574 --> 00:48:00.510
EMPHASIZE THAT. AS WE ARE

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:06.316
BUILDING OUT INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:07.551
ESPECIALLY FOR BIG. THERE IS

00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:08.485
THIS OP. TO CAPITALIZE ON LOWER

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.587
RIVER ENERGY PRICES. AT THAT

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:12.522
STORAGE. AND CREATE A MORE

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:14.925
RESILIENT SYSTEM. THIS IS

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.393
SOMETHING WE'VE INVESTED AND FOR

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.561
EXAMPLE IN SANTA CLARA VALLEY

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:20.297
TRANSIT WHERE WE'VE- INVEST IN A

00:48:20.364 --> 00:48:22.699
MICROGRID. THAT COULD REVEAL OF

00:48:22.766 --> 00:48:23.433
THE THIRTY BUSES WHEN THE

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.003
GREATEST DOWN. AND WHEN THE GRID

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.604
IS DOWN USUALLY YOU CAN'T REFUEL

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:29.940
YOUR- INTERNAL COMBUSTION YOU

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:31.275
CAN'T REVEAL GASOLINE OR DIESEL

00:48:31.341 --> 00:48:32.709
EITHER THEY RUN ON ELECTRICITY

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:34.478
AS WELL SO. THIS IDEA OF LIKE

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:35.812
WHAT HOW DO WE INVEST IN THE

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:38.382
TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE FUTURE THAT

00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:39.950
WE'RE GOING TO NEED. THAT WILL

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.618
CREATE A MORE RESILIENT ENERGY

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:46.723
SYSTEM. AND. AND ALLOW US TO.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.325
BUILD THE BUSINESS CASE FOR

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:50.627
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION.

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:55.432
WELL I WOULD SAY THAT- GASOLINE

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:57.434
AND DIESEL STATIONS DO HAVE THE

00:48:57.501 --> 00:48:58.769
ABILITY IF THEY HAVE A GENERATOR

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:01.438
BUT THIS LEGISLATURE OUTLAWED

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:04.207
GENERATORS- IN IN A BILL LAST

00:49:04.274 --> 00:49:07.711
YEAR SO LOOK LAST YEAR THE

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:10.747
GOVERNOR ASKED. PEOPLE WHO OWN

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.316
ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO NOT PLUG

00:49:12.382 --> 00:49:13.684
THEM IN BECAUSE WE WERE IN A

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:16.420
POWER SHORTAGE AND SO I THINK

00:49:16.486 --> 00:49:18.789
THAT. THE FRUSTRATION FOR ME IS

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:20.157
THAT WE PASSED ALL THESE

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:22.092
EXECUTIVE ORDERS WITHOUT THE

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:23.226
LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY BEING

00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:24.928
INVOLVED IN WE SET TARGETS AND

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:26.430
WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW TO

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:28.298
GET THE TARGETS- THIS EXACT SAME

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:30.500
THING. THAT WE SEE WITH THE

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:32.135
BULLET TRAIN IS SUPPOSED TO

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:34.504
REDUCE CARBON AND IT'S TEN YEARS

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:37.908
IN THE MAKING AND WE HAVEN'T

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.543
SEEN ONE FOR THE TRACK LATE SO.

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:40.777
LOOK THIS IS THIS IS DRIVING UP

00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:42.813
THE WE HAVE 60% HIGHER

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:45.082
ELECTRICITY RATES. IN CALIFORNIA

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:46.783
THAN THE AVERAGE OF THE NATION.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.552
WE HAVE THE HIGHEST GAS PRICES

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:50.320
HIGHER THAN WHITE. THEY DON'T

RELATED TO THE TECHNICALITY

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.824
QUESTION FOR MR US SENATOR

GOOD QUESTION AND I

00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:16.399
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK MY WRIST

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:18.268
MY RESPONSE WILL NOT BE. A

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:21.137
PARTICULARLY SATISFYING FOR YOU

DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY AND KIND OF

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:27.477
WHERE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES

00:57:27.544 --> 00:57:31.347
ARE- IS A VERY KIND OF TECHNICAL

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:33.716
QUESTION AND SO I THINK- YOU'RE

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:35.151
GETTING SORT OF THE INPUT FROM

00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:36.519
OUR STATE'S ENERGY AGENCIES THAT

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:37.821
HAVE THAT KIND OF TECHNICAL

00:57:37.887 --> 00:57:39.322
EXPERTISE I THINK IT IS-

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:40.924
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND AS YOU

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.792
POINTED OUT THE- MAKING SURE

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:44.127
THAT KIND OF THAT INFORMATION IS

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.495
KIND OF GETTING BACK UP TO THE

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:46.930

INFORMED ITS DECISIONS ABOUT.

00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:51.434
BUDGET ALLOCATIONS- AND YOU KNOW

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:52.836
AS YOU SAID FOR A VERY LARGE

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:54.137
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:55.805
ENSURING THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:57.607
ARE STRANDED BUT ALSOTHAT THE-

00:57:57.674 --> 00:57:58.675
THE STATE IT'S KIND OF

00:57:58.741 --> 00:57:59.843
SUPPORTING SOME OF THE

00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:01.277
TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:03.313
NEUTRALITY- WE THINK IT'S REALLY

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:05.582
IMPORTANT SO I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:07.150
GONNA BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND GIVE

00:58:07.217 --> 00:58:08.852
YOU SORT OF A DEFINITIVE ANSWER

00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:10.353
ON EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT BUT WE

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.055
DO THINK THAT'S KIND OF AN

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:14.023
IMPORTANT ISSUE TO EXPLORE AND-

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.792
PARTICULAR EXPLODED MINISTRATION

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:17.794
. THEY ARE THEY LOOK AT THAT

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:22.265
ISSUE AND THINK ABOUT. IT GOING

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:24.267
FORWARD. THANK YOU MUCH OF. AND

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:27.003
JUST IF WE COULD ALSO FROM- FROM

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:30.206
THAT AREA. BORDERS ONE. THANK

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:34.344
YOU TO RANDOLPH SURE- AND- I'M

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:35.612
SURE COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN ALSO

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:37.313
HAS A LOT TO ADD ON ON THIS

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.082
ISSUE AS WELL I DON'T EVEN KNOW

00:58:39.148 --> 00:58:42.485
AT THIS OINT WE ARE MOVING AS

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:44.687
AS FAST AS WE CAN AND AS HARD AS

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:46.756
WE CAN TOWARDS A ZERO EMISSION

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:48.358
FUTURE AND I THINK WE'RE NOT AT

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:49.692
THE POINT YET WHERE WE SHOULD BE

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:53.129
TAKING OPTIONS OFF THE TABLE-

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.465
RIGHT NOW OUR AN INCENTIVE

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:59.903
PROGRAMS DO INCENTIVIZE- BOTH

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:02.105
HAD BATTERY ELECTRIC AND FUEL

00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:06.042
CELL OPTIONS. AND AND I THINK

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:09.078
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO

00:59:09.145 --> 00:59:10.980
UNDERSTAND THE PERFORMANCE OF

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:15.852
THOSE AND TO- INSURE THAT OUR-

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:18.154
HYDROGEN PRODUCTION GETS GREENER

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:21.124
AND LOWER CARBON- HAS AS WE MOVE

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:24.994
FORWARD- SO I THINK AND I THINK

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:28.765
THERE'S STILL A ROLE FOR- UP ALL

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:31.634
TECHNOLOGIES AS WE CONTINUE TO

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:34.370
MAKE THIS TRANSITION. AND THANK

00:59:34.437 --> 00:59:36.172
YOU CHAIR READ SO GOD CHAIR

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.608
MONAGHAN HAD DE I WOULD NOT PUT

00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:40.443
IT TO YOU WHAT WATCH IT WOULD BE

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.612
THINKING ABOUT INVESTMENTS IF

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:43.813
AND WHEN THE STATE GETS BEYOND

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.782
THE CURRENTLY FUNDED HUNDREDS OF

00:59:45.848 --> 00:59:47.784
LIKE TO THE HYDRANT STATIONS AS

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:53.056
WELL AS THE SMALL NUMBER. OF

00:59:53.122 --> 00:59:53.623
MEAT MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:54.857
STATIONS WE HAVE. WHAT WE HAVE A

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:56.859
STATE GOAL HAVE TO. STATION OKAY

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:58.328
BY TWO TWENTY AND WE'RE

00:59:58.394 --> 00:59:59.929
TARGETING OUR INVESTMENTS TO BE

00:59:59.996 --> 01:00:02.932
ABLE TO REACH THAT GOAL- WITH

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:05.635
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE SHOULD

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:06.269
HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO HAVE

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:08.204
TWO HUNDRED. OPEN RETAIL

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.239
HYDROGEN STATIONS. THOSE

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:12.675
STATIONS WHICH AS I SAID

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:14.444
THIRTEEN. CAN HOPEFULLY MORE

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.645
WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:17.580
REFUEL BIG SENSE AS WELL AS

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:20.283
PASSENGER VEHICLES- AND THAT'S A

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.218
GOOD POINT FOR US TO YOU KNOW TO

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.252
SEE HOW WELL WE'RE TIGHT

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.688
TRADING. THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:28.257
THE ACTUAL VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT SO

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:30.493
THOSE STATIONS SHOULD HAVE

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.764
ENOUGH. CASSIDY TO REFUEL CLOSE

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:35.498
TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FUEL

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:37.100
CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT'S

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.668
NEARLY FIVE TIMES WHAT INDUSTRY

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.237
EXPECTS TO HAVE ON THE ROAD BY

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.872
TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO THAT THAT

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:43.539
WOULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:44.674
US TO SORT OF EVALUATE. DOES THE

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:46.309
INFRASTRUCTURE NEED MEAT WHAT

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.944
WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:51.114
MARKET- AND AS I SAID IN MY

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.482
POINTS I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE WE

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:54.550
FACE SOME HYDROGEN SHORTAGES WE

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:56.252
FACE SOME. LIKE BREAKDOWN OF

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.021
EQUIPMENT THAT WAS HARD TO FIX

01:00:58.087 --> 01:00:59.589
WHEN IT CAME TO THE STATIONS

01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:00.590
THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:02.692
NASCENT. NATURE OF THE OF THE

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:06.262
STATION TECHNOLOGY- AND SO AS-

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:10.900
THE MARKET EXPANDS. WE ASSUME

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.135
SOME OF THOSE ROAD BLOCKS ARE

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.270
GOING TO GO DOWN WE'RE WORKING

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.038
ACTIVELY TO OVERCOME THOSE

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:17.407
ROADBLOCKS BUT- I THINK THAT

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.542
THAT FOR US IS. IS A MOMENT TO

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:20.743
KIND OF EVALUATE WHAT WHERE ARE

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:23.346
WE AND- THIS WE HAVE REPORTS

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.214
THAT WE DO- ANNUALLY WITH THE

01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:26.549
AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN CHARGE

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.284
OUR JOINT AGENCIES WILL. WILL

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:29.352
COME UP WITH SORT OF AN

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.820
ASSESSMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ON

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.722
ON HOW WELL WE'RE DOING IN TERMS

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:35.291
OF MATCHING. INFRASTRUCTURE WITH

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.593
THE NEED. I DO APPRECIATE AN

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.594

DISCUSSION- I YOU KNOW I'M I'M I

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.941

NEAR ZERO EMISSION ANOTHER

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:05.254
PEOPLE FEEL REALLY STRONGLY

ABOUT THIS ON EITHER SIDES- I'D

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:10.193
JUST LIKE TO GET MORE- MORE OF A

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:13.496
SENSE FROM FROM FOLKS- IT MAY

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.664
MAY MAYBE THE MAYBE THAT THAT

THE GERMAN FROM THE- THE AIR

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:17.266
QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THE

SOUTH COAST. I CAN JUST GIVE US

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:22.905

KNOW THE PERMITTING OF INTER

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:27.743
MINUTE OPTION OF NEAR ZERO HEAVY

DUTY TACK. MAYBE OTHER PANELS

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.914
MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL PARTS OF

THE ONE ADD INTO THAT THAT

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.817
QUESTION. THANK YOU IF I MAY ADD

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:36.419
ON THAT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.453
HAD AS WELL SPECIFIC TO

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.555
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS- BECAUSE I

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:41.390
THINK THERE WAS A- STRATEGY

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:43.626
HORIZON THAT I HEARD FROM-

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.328
EXECUTIVE OFFICE OFFICER MISATO

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:47.797
ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN YEARS. WHILE

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:49.232
WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING ZERO

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:50.266
EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.401
SIMULTANEOUSLY SO. I'D LIKE TO

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.570
KNOW IF THAT'S STILL THE FACT IS

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:56.405
THAT IS THAT STILL THE CASE- AND

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:58.274
I THINK TWO. OF THE SENATORS

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:02.078
POINT AS WELL AS HOW ELSE WE CAN

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.714
BE THINKING ABOUT- THE- IN ZERO

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.517
EMISSION TECHNOLOGY- AT THE SAME

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.085
TIME BECAUSE I THINK OUR

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.052
COMMUNITIES DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.187
WHERE THIS IS ALL HEADED AND

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.755
THERE'S A LOT OF EVERYONE

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:13.756
PUTTING THEIR STAKE IN THE

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.358
GROUND AS ZERO EMISSION VERSUS

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:16.659
NEAR ZERO AND IT'S BECOME VERY

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:19.529
COMPLEX FOR MOST OF THE PUBLIC.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.164
APOLOGY SENATOR ALAN FOR TAKING

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.465
THAT OVER BUT I THINK WE'RE ON

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.567
THE SAME TEACHERS TO THINK YOU

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.269
SO MUCH- MISTER MUSETTO. THANK

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:28.204
YOU. MADAM AND SENATOR ALAN

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:30.673
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO I

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.208
JUST WANT TO TRY TO MAKE IT

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:34.810
CLEAR IS THAT WE ARE COMPLETELY

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.646
ON BOARD. WITH THE STATE ON ZERO

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:38.481
EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES. BUT THE

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:40.249
SAD FACT OF THE MATTER IS

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:42.251
THEY'RE JUST NOT AVAILABLE IN

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.053
LARGE VYING SURVEIL OF ALL. IN

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.521
SMALL FARMS AND FOR THE SMALL

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:47.223
VEHICLES. RIGHT BUT IF YOU WANT

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.258
A BIG TRUCK PULLING CARGO AT THE

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.360
PORTS. IN ORDER TO GET TO THE

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:52.695
THOUSANDS OF TRUCKS THAT WE NEED

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.530
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME I THINK IT

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.065
COMMISSIONER MON HAD NOTED THAT.

IS THAT. WE SHOULD BE SAVING

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.511
LIVES TODAY. BY PUTTING OUT A

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:09.679
CLEANER TECHNOLOGY IS

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:11.247
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN LARGE

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.582
NUMBERS THAT'S ALREADY ROLLING

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:15.985
DOWN PRODUCTION LINES. ON THE

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.420

DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS AND WE

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:29.599
BELIEVE THE FUNDS SHOULD BE

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:31.767
DISTRIBUTED. AT THAT PROVIDES

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:34.003
THE MOST EMISSIONS BENEFIT THE

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.838
BILL DECISION SHOULD BE HOW MANY

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.273

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.108
FUNDING. AND SO I THINK WITH

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:40.443
THIS GREAT SURPLUS WE SHOULD DO

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:42.078
BUT WE SHOULD PLAN FOR ZERO

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.513
EMISSIONS AT. TECHNOLOGY FUTURE

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.516
WHILE WE CLEAN THE AIR TODAY AND

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:48.751

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:19.081
COMBUSTION AS QUICKLY AS

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:22.852
POSSIBLE- AND SO WOW WE DO HAVE

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:24.787

INCENTIVIZE NATURAL GAS

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.891

WITHOUT COMBUSTION. AND I WILL

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:43.272
NOTE THAT NATURAL GAS TRUCKS DO

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.007
DETERIORATED PERFORMANCE OVER

FIFTY FIVE ORGANIZATIONS ARE

BUT I HEARING THE- GREAT PANEL.

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:13.602
A KIND OF POP MUSIC KIND OF JUST

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.337
REALLY. IN TO SOME OF THE WHITE

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.539
REALLY HARD HITTING ISSUES.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.041
FIRST I THINK IT'S CLEAR. THAT-

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.210
WE ALL UNDERSTAND. THE IMPACT OF

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:24.780
TRANSPORTATION AND WHAT- IMPACT

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:26.115
THAT HAS ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS.

01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:28.584
AND ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND A

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:30.653
TOXIC EXPOSURE TO THE COMMUTER

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.888
ALONG QUITE FOUR DOLLARS WHETHER

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.523

DIEGO. OUR WEST SPOKESMAN. NEAR

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:51.006
THE PARK OPEN. IT. CRITICAL THAT

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:54.276
WE TRANSITION TO A MEASURE. AS

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:57.012
RAPIDLY AS PART. NOT JUST FOR

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:59.148
RESULT IN THE COMING. BUT RESULT

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:00.616
IN THE PUBLIC HOW CRISIS THAT

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:03.552
ARE CA. ARE WHEN. IF YOU LOOK AT

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:08.257
THE TEN. HERE MANY THAT ARE THAT

01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:13.662
THOSE. THURMOND SERIES OF CANCER

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:17.366
. AND ALEVE- ISSUES AS POINT. IT

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:20.135
FAT BUT TO DO THAT I LIVE IN

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:21.937
HAVE TO HAVE A- THAT FOCUSES ON

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.473
. WITH ASTHMA. THE GOAL IS THAT

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.175
WE ARE. THE NEED FOR SUCH ARE.

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:27.943
THAT'S GREATER THEY ARE. WE

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.211
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE ABOUT THAT

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.847
AND YOUR MONEY RESOURCES. ARE

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:32.815
INVOLVED IN SOMETHING THAT IS

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:43.525
PART. I DOLLARS BUT THEN WE'RE

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:45.561
TALKING ABOUT THE INVESTMENT.

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:46.495
THAT WILL BE MAKING OF THEIR

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:49.298
CREW INVESTMENTS ARE NOT JUST.

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:51.133
YOU KNOW STRATEGICALLY PLACED

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.068
AND PLANNED TO MEET PARTICULAR

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:56.004
OUTCOMES THAT ARE KIND OF-

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:58.540
FABRICATED IN SOME WAYS. I I'M

01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:00.776
ALLUDING TO THE CLEAN AIR ACT IN

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.244
THE NEXT DOWNTURN THAT THE BILLS

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.179
ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND WE NEED

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:05.948
TO MAKE SURE WE MEET THE LOCALS

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:08.517
AND THOSE REQUIREMENTS. BUT

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:09.084
THERE ARE CERTAIN POLLUTANTS

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:11.453
THAT ARCH I'M REGULATED UNDER

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.722
THOSE. THING FIVE CULTURE FINE

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:18.594
PARTICLES THAT ARE TOXIC BY PURE

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.995
. FIVE NATURE OF. THOSE

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.964
PARTICLES ARE IMPORTANT TO

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:24.166
ELIMINATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.000
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.802
REGULATED UNDER THE- THE

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.670
NATIONAL AIR AT AMBIENT AIR

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.405
QUALITY STANDARDS. OUR

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:32.908
COMMUNITIES DESERVE CLEAN AIR

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:35.677
THEY DESERVE ZERO POLLUTION AND

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.179
SO- MORE THINKING ABOUT THESE

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.981
INVESTMENT OF THE LIMITED

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:41.817
DOLLARS I THINK ABOUT WHERE WE

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:42.918
ARE IN TERMS OF THOSE

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:45.020
COMMUNITIES ALONG THE FREIGHT

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.289
CORRIDORS. AND IF WE WERE TO

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:50.459
THINK ABOUT JUST IN BACK IN IN.

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:53.495
THOSE CORRIDORS WITH THE

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.664
EQUIPMENT THAT MOVE GOODS

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:57.599
THROUGHOUT THE STATE YOU KNOW WE

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.334
WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:00.602
JUST INVEST IN THOSE VERY

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.738
LOCALIZED AREAS LIKE GRADE

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:04.573
STRUCTURE. LIKE LOCOMOTIVES LIKE

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.608
CARGO AND EQUIPMENT LIKE

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:10.279
CONTROLLING- SHIP EMISSIONS. MY

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:11.413
CONTENTION IS THAT WE REALLY

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.016
CARE ABOUT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:15.284
WE CARE ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.586
JUSTICE WE NEED TO INVEST IN

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:19.087
THOSE COMMUNITIES FIRST AND

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:21.523
FOREMOST MAKE SURE THAT WE GET

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.559
TO THEIR- POLLUTION. BECAUSE

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.761
THEIR ROLE- EMISSIONS AND

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.129
INTERNAL COMBUSTION

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.931
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE INVEST IN

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.966
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE LIKE

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:34.169
NATURAL GAS. AND WE SET UP A

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:36.171
FIFTY M. AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:38.340
YEARS AND YEARS TO COME THAT IN

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:39.575
MY MIND IT'S NOT A TRUE

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.343
INVESTMENT. INVESTMENT IS

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:43.011
SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT THE

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:45.247
LONG TERM AND BY THE TIME WE

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.549
TRANSITION OUT OF. COMBUSTION

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:49.351
VEHICLES YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:51.220
GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN THAT

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:52.988
HAVE DEVELOPED AND THEIR LONG

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:54.389
HAVE DEVELOPED AND UNDER

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:55.724
DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE

01:14:55.791 --> 01:15:07.870
TO- CULTUREFINDER AND COMBUSTION. MISSION THE OTHER AREA THAT I

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:10.038
TO- PLAN IS THAT WE ARE. IN A

01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:12.908
GROWTH PATTERN TERMS OF THREE

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.576
FOR. AND PRAY TRAFFIC WE SEE AN

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.445
EXPLOSION OF WAREHOUSE WHICH- AN

01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:18.313
EXPOSURE OF THROUGHPUT THE TWO

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.782
WE IT. OF FREEWAYS AND THEM OF

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:21.817
TRUCKS THERE GOING TO OUR

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:23.886
NEIGHBOR. SO WHAT WILL ONE BASS

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:25.387
WE WANT MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:26.288
NOT. ONE FORWARD INTO BACK

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.290
ESPECIALLY WE'RE TRYING TO

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.959
PRODUCTION WHEN WE ARE IF WE ARE

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:34.363
TO INVEST IN- NATURAL GAS

01:15:34.429 --> 01:15:37.532
VEHICLES- AND WE ARE GOING TO

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:39.101
DEPEND ON THE PRODUCTION OF

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.736
NATURAL GAS AT THE SAME TIME.

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:42.070
OTHER ARMS ARE TRYING TO

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:44.139
ELIMINATE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:46.408
GAS IN COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:48.944
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:49.711
ONE STEP TWO STEPS BACKWARD.

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:51.413
THANK YOU MAY LOGIN AND IF YOU

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.681

WHERE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOLLARS WE

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:01.556
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE-

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:04.259
INSURING THE INVESTMENT IN ZERO

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:09.598
ELIMINATE JOBS AT THE PORT CARE

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:11.400
ON THE DOCK AND THAT WE MAKE

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:12.034

IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND REDUCE

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:05.153
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.855
ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE. I MEAN

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:08.390
ESTABLISH CLOSE TO GET TO ZERO

BY TWENTY THIRTY AND TRUCKS BY

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:13.862
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. BUT IF WE'RE

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:15.230
GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE CAN'T

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.865
UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:19.968
EFFORT AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:22.204
STILL REQUIRED TO GET. HERE TWO

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:22.904
MAIN AREAS OF FOCUS EACH WITH

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.506
THEIR OWN ST OF CHALLENGES.

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:25.907
FIRST DEVELOPING THE VEHICLES

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:27.642
AND EQUIPMENT. OPERATING

TERMINAL EQUIPMENT AND ON ROAD

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:34.649
HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE SEVERE.

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:36.451
THESE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:38.120
HAVE TO BE RELIABLE AND POWERFUL

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:39.855
WITH HIGH CAPACITY BATTERIES ARE

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.990
ADEQUATE FUEL STORAGE. AND

EXTENDED RANGE HYDROGEN FUEL

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:45.994
CELL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE PROMISED

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.729
THAT DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY FOR

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.297
OPERATE EQUIPMENT IS FURTHER

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:51.366
BEHIND. TODAY'S YOUR MISSION

01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:52.768
YOUR CALL REPLACEMENTS THAT CAN

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.269
MEET THE RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.104
SUPPORT WORK AREN'T FEASIBLE FOR

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:58.273
MOST APPLICATIONS. WE'VE BEEN

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.307
DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:01.076
NUMEROUS PROJECTS TO ADVANCED

ON THE ROADS. AND PROJECT

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.947
PARTNERS HAVE LEARNED A LOT

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:07.649
THROUGH THESE DEMONSTRATIONS.

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.351
SOME OF THIS EQUIPMENT IS IN ITS

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:10.552
THIRD GENERATION AND IMPORTANT

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.387
IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE. BUT

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.089
THEY AREN'T READY YET. SOME

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:15.624
TERMINALS AND HANDED EQUIPMENT

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:17.392
BACK AFTER DEMONSTRATIONS

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:19.027
INCLUDE BECAUSE THEY DON'T MEET

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:20.929
THEIR OPERATIONAL NEEDS. WE

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:22.931
BELIEVE IT WILL STILL BE SEVERAL

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:23.932
YEARS BEFORE THESE VEHICLES ARE

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:26.068
FULLY FEASIBLE. AND LASTLY THE

FEDEX. THAT'S THE VEHICLE

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.213
TECHNOLOGY BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.182
THE INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:29.050
FOR BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:30.252
MEETING THE CHARGING NEEDS OF

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.555
TECHNICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:35.123
FEASIBLE AND ALREADY HAPPENING.

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:36.358
SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:38.526
UNLOCKED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BY

INFRASTRUCTURE BY TWENTY TWENTY

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:58.913
FOUR. AND THIS IS THE FIRST

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.115
TRANCHE OF FUNDING. SO THAT'S

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:01.783
THE GOOD NEWS BUT WE CAN'T CLOSE

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:03.318
OUR EYES TO THE REALITY THAT

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:04.552
ELECTRIC VEHICLES STILL HAVE

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.755
HIGH UP FRONT COSTS. MOREOVER

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.957
EXPLOITATIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:10.158
THAT ARE RAMPANT IN THE TRUCKING

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:11.626
INDUSTRY SUCH AS DRIVERS

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.094
CLASSIFICATION. MAKE IT

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:15.363
DIFFICULT FOR DRIVERS TO UPGRADE

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:16.731

TRANSITION ZERO MISSION ARE

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:23.338
IMPERATIVE BUT SO TOO ARE

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:24.739
POLICIES THAT ADDRESS BUSINESS

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:26.941
PRACTICES IT SHOULD HAVE COST TO

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:29.110
DRIVERS. ALSO NONTECHNICAL

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:30.111
CHALLENGES AROUND PLANNING

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:31.746
PERMITTING AND COSTS TO REMAIN

01:22:31.813 --> 01:22:33.982
ON YOUR STRUCTURE SO. ROUGH TO A

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:35.016
GOOD START BUT A LOT MORE IS

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:37.118
NEEDED. HOWEVER PUBLIC HOWEVER

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:39.087
BECAUSE PUBLIC FUNDING IS SO

01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:41.056
LIMITED WE SHOULD ONLY BE

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:43.358
SPENDING ON THE OUTCOME WE NEED.

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.493
ZERO TAILPIPE EMISSIONS NATURAL

GAS VEHICLES ARE ANTIQUATED

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:49.130
SECOND BEST SOLUTION IT SHOULD

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:50.365
NOT BE SUPPORT. IT WILL

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:51.700
PERPETUATE OUR RELIANCE ON

ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS WE

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:48.416
RECOMMEND FOCUSING ON THOSE USE

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:50.084
CASES BEST SUITED FOR TODAY'S

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:52.353

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:01.696
TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES THIS TYPE OF

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:03.665
OPERATION PRIMARILY FOUND IN THE

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:05.767
FINAL MILE DELIVERY SPACE SHOULD

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:06.935
OVERCOME MANY OF THE BARRIERS

EIGHT TO TEN HOUR PERIOD WHICH

01:25:23.985 --> 01:25:26.020
LESSENS GREAT IMPACT. FOR LARGER

01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:27.655
CLASS SEVENTY TRACTORS WILL BE

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:29.057
MORE DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME THESE

01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:31.292

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:54.983
ENERGY COMMISSION HAS ESTIMATED

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:56.818
THAT THE SIXTEEN THOUSAND CLASS

PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CHARGING

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:19.107

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:35.423
THAT WILL BE THE EXCEPTION

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.925

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.222
SUSTAINABLE ADDRESSING THE

UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODEL AND

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:51.759
ENSURING THAT THE INDUSTRY WOULD

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:54.462
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOR

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:56.030
THE TRANSITION. UNFORTUNATELY

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:57.699
THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY CHALLENGE

01:28:57.765 --> 01:28:59.033
THAT POST IN THE COURTS.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.135
ULTIMATELY GETTING IT. LEFT US

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:02.570
WITH A MANDATE FOR NEW CONTRACTS

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:04.505
WITH NO DRIVER PROTECTIONS

01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:05.940
COMPANIES PASSED THE BUILDING

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.775
DRIVERS. AND THE RESULTING WAGE

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:09.010
THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN BY THE

MODERN DAY INDENTURED SERVITUDE

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.422
. WHAT EXPERIENCE TELLS US IS

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:23.458
THAT IF THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:25.259
DRIVERLESS CLASSIFICATION IS NOT

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:27.495
ADDRESSED THEN WE WILL NOT BE

01:29:27.562 --> 01:29:29.230
ABLE TO REACH OUR MISSION- NOT

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:31.032
ONLY WOULD BE IMMORAL PRINCE TO

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:32.934
YET AGAIN FORCED DRIVERS TO BEAR

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.870
THAT BURDEN. IT'S ALSO

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.138
UNSUSTAINABLE. REPORTS MOST

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:38.840
RECENT DATA SHOW THAT THE

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:40.141
EMISSIONS GAINES IN THE FIRST

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:41.943
CONTRACT PROGRAMMER RECEIVING A

TREND THAT BEGAN WELL BEFORE THE

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:45.346
RECENT CONGESTION THIS IS PARTLY

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:46.848
BECAUSE DRIVERS CAN AFFORD

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:49.784
UPGRADES OR EVEN OFF AND REPAIR

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:50.852
. READ STORIES OF DRIVERS IN

DIESEL ENGINES IN THE LNG TRUCK

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.288
BECAUSE THEY WERE DROWNING IN

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:56.324
REPAIR BILLS. ANECDOTES ARE BORN

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:57.759
OUT OF CARDS OWN DATA WHICH

01:29:57.825 --> 01:29:59.127
OTHER TRUCKS IN THE SO CALLED

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:00.995
CONTRACTING SEGMENT HAVE THE

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.630
LOWEST COMPLIANCE WITH THE

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.198
STATE'S TRUCK COMBUSTIBLE. IS

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:06.567
WE'VE HEARD YOU THEIR MISSION

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:08.436
TRUCK CAN COST TEN TIMES MORE.

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:09.771
SO TO THE POINT THAT INDEPENDENT

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:11.539
CON INDEPENDENT OWNER OPERATORS

01:30:11.606 --> 01:30:13.474
WILL NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT I

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:14.876
WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE MOST IF

01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:17.211
NOT ALL HE SAYS THAT WE SUPPORT

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:19.046
USED TRUCK OWNERS ARE IN FACT

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:21.082
EMPLOYEES UNDER THE LAW. AS A

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.884
LEGAL SYSTEM SYSTEM HAS

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:25.319
OVERWHELMINGLY FOUND. NOT ONLY

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:26.587
UNSUSTAINABLE FOR THEIR

EMPLOYERS THE PAST TRUCK COSTS

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:29.657
ON TO THEM IT'S ILLEGAL WE MUST

01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:31.159
ENSURE THAT OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:33.027
ARE NOT. USED YET AGAIN TO FORCE

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:34.395
DRIVERS AND THE PUBLIC PREDATORY

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:36.964
LOANS AN INDENTURED SERVITUDE.

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:38.766
WERE DISTURBING PUBLIC FUNDS TO

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.169
PRIVATE INDUSTRY THAT HAS REAPED

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:42.370
RECORD PROFITS BREADED THAT THEY

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:43.771
COULD NOT MAKE. WE MUST MAKE

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:44.806
SURE THAT AND SEVEN DOLLARS AND

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:46.040
THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARDS

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:48.042
ATTACHED BUT IN TERMS OF

TECHNOLOGY AND LABOR STANDARDS

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:50.945
FOR DRIVERS. REGARDING THE

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:52.547
IMPORTANCE OF THEIR MISSION I

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:53.915
WANT TO ECHO THE POINTS RAISED

01:30:53.981 --> 01:30:55.616
BY ANGELA BUT HE FEELS REGARDING

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:56.717
THE LABOR STANDARDS WE MUST

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:58.452
ENSURE FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:00.354
VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF AB SEVEN

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.557

LEADERSHIP IN RAISING THE

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:07.361
STANDARDS. WE ALSO NEED MORE

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:08.796
STRATEGIC COMPREHENSIVE

01:31:08.863 --> 01:31:10.598
ENFORCEMENT BY STATE AGENCIES TO

01:31:10.665 --> 01:31:12.233
ROOT OUT THE CLASSIFICATION OF

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.268
THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY. ONE LAST

01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:15.503
POINT ABOUT A PAYMENT THAT WHEN

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.605
EMPATHIZE ELECTRIFICATION SHOULD

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:19.740
NOT MEAN AUTOMATION VERY OFTEN

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:21.609
THE INDUSTRY USES THIS ISSUE TO

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:24.145
CREATE A FALSE DICHOTOMY AND PET

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:24.645
LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL

01:31:24.712 --> 01:31:26.380
INTERESTS. AGAINST EACH OTHER WE

01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:29.450
CAN WE SHOULD TRANSITION OUR-

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:30.785
AND ELECTRIFICATION. BY

01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:32.086
MAINTAINING THE GOOD UNION JOBS

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:33.688
WE HAVE IN THE GOOD FOR THAT

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:34.956
SECTOR AND FUELING THIS

01:31:35.022 --> 01:31:36.958
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A MARKET

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:38.726
JOBS SOME CLOTHING AS LONG AS

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.895
THE INDUSTRY. THAT OUR COURTS.

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:43.097
BEYOND UP OUT OPERATE OUTSIDE OF

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:44.799
THE LAN WITH AN ILLEGAL BUSINESS

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:47.268
MODEL IF THE CLASSIFICATION. IT

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:58.045
WILL CONTINUE. TO HINDER OUR

01:31:58.112 --> 01:31:58.646
EFFORTS TO BE TRANSITION. BUT

01:31:58.713 --> 01:31:59.680
THE BILL OF DOLLARS IN THE

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:01.916
CENTER FUND THAT WILL GOING TO

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:02.583
THAT KIND. WE HAVE A REAL UP. TO

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:14.428
AND WILL NOW TAKE IT TO THE

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:16.097
FLOOR FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM

01:32:16.163 --> 01:32:18.532
SENATORS ON THIS PANEL- WE HAVE

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:22.803
SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.906
CHAIR. I HAVE A QUESTION WHAT

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:28.442
DOES IT COST TO- TO CHARGE- WHEN

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:32.513
THESE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. THAT

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.682
DIRECTED TO ANY SPECIFIC US

01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:39.220
ANALYST YEAH WELL I DON'T KNOW.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:41.622
MAYBE THAT'S THE THINK- IS

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.791
TIMELY IS GOING OFF MUTINOUS

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:45.860
TIMELY WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER.

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:47.395
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE THE

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:49.196
EXACT NUMBERS BUT THAT'S PART OF

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:51.265
WHAT WE'RE GATHERING THROUGH THE

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:52.700
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:54.168
WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING THERE'S A

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:56.170
LOT OF UNKNOWNS ABOUT THIS

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:59.073
TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT IT MEANS TO

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:02.710
CHARGE THEM- AND- QUITE FRANKLY.

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:04.111
THE TIME THAT YOU CHARGE THEM

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:05.680
HOW MANY YOU HAVE CHARGING AT

01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:07.148
THE SAME TIME THERE'S A LOT OF

01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:08.783
DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO

01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:11.485
YOU THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.187
BUT THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:14.889
DOING ARE TO HELP US GATHER THAT

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:16.257
INFORMATION SO WE CAN MAKE

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:18.359
BETTER PROJECTIONS. ABOUT WHAT

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:20.261
THE COST WILL BE BUT ALSO WHAT

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.562
TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:22.763
NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO BUILD

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:24.498
OUT SO THAT WE CAN CONDUCT THE

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:26.934
OPERATIONS IN A WAY THAT CAN

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:28.202
SUPPORT- THAT THE NUMBER OF

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:29.603
VEHICLES THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:32.273
CHARGED THIRTY WILL

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:32.974
SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE FOLLOW

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.909
QUESTION ANSWER IT. I DON'T KNOW

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:36.377
WHO MENTIONED IT BUT ONE OF ONE

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.012
OF THE PANELISTS MENTIONED THE

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.613
COST OF THE TRUCK COULD BE TEN

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.683
TIMES AS MUCH AS A CONVENTIONAL

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.318
. TRUCK IS THAT WAS THAT WAS

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:48.189
THAT WAS AN ACCURATE. SO I THINK

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:50.391
I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS AND

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:51.892
NETWORK WHEN I'M TAKING INTO

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.527
ACCOUNT THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:54.996
THAT A BRAND NEW ZERO EMISSIONS

01:33:55.062 --> 01:33:57.732
TRUCK IS TEN TIMES MORE THAN A

01:33:57.798 --> 01:33:59.333
BRAND NEW DIESEL TRUCK. DATE

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.235
THAT WE HAVE IS THE MAJORITY OF

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:02.570
FOLKS AND I THINK CHRIS COULD

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:04.038
PROBABLY ANSWER THIS A LITTLE

01:34:04.105 --> 01:34:05.606
BIT MORE DIRECTLY THE MORE

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:06.807
MAJORITY OF THE FOLKS TO

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:08.709
PARTICIPATE AND PORT DRAINAGE

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:10.811
ARE PURCHASING BRAND NEW TRUCKS

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:12.646
RIGHT OFF THAT IS THOUGH NOT

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:14.482
THEIR PURHASING USED TRUCKS

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:16.317
THAT ARE MUCH CHEAPER. FOR THEM

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:18.819
TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO BED THAT

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:21.389
IS SERVICE AND SO TRYING TO ASK

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:23.824
THOSE FOLKS TO GET INTO A BRAND

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:27.728
NEW ELECTRIC OR FUEL CELL TRUCK

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:32.800
IS A BIG LEAP FROM WHAT THEY ARE

01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:35.903
TYPICALLY USED TO PAYING. OKAY

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:36.804
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK ANOTHER

01:34:36.871 --> 01:34:39.206
CLEAR RESTAURANTS COULD ANSWER

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:39.774
THAT'D BE GREAT BECAUSE I'M

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.909
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. YEAH WE DO

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:42.877
WE THE LAST TIME I WAS TALKED

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:45.813
ABOUT. YOU KNOW BASICALLY LABOR

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.783
ISSUES AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:51.786
INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS- THAT. I'D

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:52.720
LIKE TO KIND OF GET AN IDEA OF

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:54.422
WHAT I MEAN WE'VE SEEN. WE'VE

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:56.323
SEEN THE PORTS CONGESTED IN IN

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:57.658
IS THAT DUE TO THE FACT THAT

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:59.727
THE- MISSIONS ARE HAVE BEEN

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:00.861
THERE OR THAT THEY CAN AFFORD

01:35:00.928 --> 01:35:03.097
THE TRUCKS OR IS IT BECAUSE WE

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:04.398
HAVE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:07.368
HAVE. CAN'T COME IN THERE. HERE

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:09.537
TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION WITH

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:11.672
REGARDS TO THE INDUSTRY I MEAN

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:14.108
WANT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. I

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:15.810
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.344
THAT. YOU KNOW THESE LARGER

01:35:17.411 --> 01:35:18.879
FLEETS ARE BEING EXCLUDED FROM

01:35:18.946 --> 01:35:20.047
THE STATE'S INCENTIVE PROGRAMS

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:22.917
IS THAT. IT'S REALLY THOSE LARGE

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:25.152
MEDIUM SIZE FLEETS THEY'RE GONNA

01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:27.188
HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL. TO MAKE

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:28.355
THESE INITIAL INVESTMENTS TO

01:35:28.422 --> 01:35:30.524
BUILD THIS MARKET WHERE I THINK

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:33.060
IN THE CHOIR PANEL. THERE WAS A

01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:33.661
DISCUSSION ABOUT THERE'S FEWER

01:35:33.727 --> 01:35:35.729
THAN A HUNDRED. ELECTRIC

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:36.697
VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TODAY AND

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:39.366
SO- THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY AT

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:41.769
LARGE I MEAN. SETTING ASIDE THE

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:44.205
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR ISSUE.

01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:45.873
96% OF THE TRUCKING COMPANIES

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.708
NATIONALLY OPERATE TWENTY OR

01:35:47.775 --> 01:35:49.610
FEWER TRUCKS AND SO DID THIS IS

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:51.946
A SMALL BUSINESS. MOM AND POP

01:35:52.012 --> 01:35:54.815
ORIENTED INDUSTRY TO BEGIN WITH.

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:56.417
ARE WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:58.352
THAT ARE. YOU KNOW LARGER

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:01.222
INDUSTRY LEADERS CAN GET. STATE

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:03.891
SUPPORT TO- YOU KNOW REALLY TAKE

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:05.759
THAT THE FIRST STEP IN THE WATER

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:07.228
WITH THESE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:09.697
MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK- AND

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:11.298
THEN. REALLY YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:13.167
OVER TIME AS THE TECHNOLOGY

01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:14.368
IMPROVES THESE MARKETS WILL

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:16.470
BUILD ON THEIR OWN- AS BATTERY

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:18.072
TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES AND ACTUALLY

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:19.540
FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW HOW T

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:22.843
INTEGRATE THIS. INTO THE SUPPLY

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:24.545
CHAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:28.682
QUESTIONS. OKAY I DO HAVE A

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:30.050
QUESTION I THINK THE L. DIRECT

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:32.386
THIS TO MISS TOMMY. I THINK

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:34.388
THERE WAS A QUESTION PRIOR ABOUT

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:36.290
A TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:38.792
POTENTIALLY FOR A HYDROGEN HUB-

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:41.695
IN LOCKPORT OF LONG BEACH. PORT

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:44.165
ST PETER- BAY CAN YOU TOUCH ON

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:45.933
THAT A BIT AND WHAT. I DON'T

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.168
KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY UPDATES ON

01:36:47.234 --> 01:36:49.270
THAT AND- YOU KNOW THAT WILL

01:36:49.336 --> 01:36:50.838
CERTAINLY FURTHER ADDITIONAL

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:52.072
REDUCTIONS BUT WOULD LOVE TO

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:53.507
HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT AND THEN I

01:36:53.574 --> 01:36:55.643
HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION RELATED

01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:57.778
TO. THE CONTAINER FEE. SURE I

01:36:57.845 --> 01:36:59.613
CAN PROVIDE A FEW BRIEF

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.149
COMMENTS. AND WE'RE VERY WE'RE

ALSO TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL THERE'S

01:37:04.084 --> 01:37:05.419
BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:07.454
THAT WE'RE ALSO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT

01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:09.023

THAT WAS ADOPTED AND PROPOSED AS

01:38:58.866 --> 01:39:03.270
A DETERRENT. TO ENCOURAGE- THAT

01:39:03.337 --> 01:39:04.838

ANNOUNCEMENT OF FIFTY IT'S HAD

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.988
ITS INTENDED EFFECT AND WE'RE

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:23.724
CONTINUING TO SEE. A REALLY

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:26.093
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN LONG

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.961
TWELVE TRAINERS THAT HE HAS

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:30.064
BANNED THAT POSTPONED NUMEROUS

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:32.132
TIMES. MOST RECENTLY THE

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:33.734
ANNOUNCEMENT CAME OUT IT WILL BE

POSTPONED UNTIL AT LEAST

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:38.105
FEBRUARY NINETEENTH I BELIEVE IS

01:39:38.172 --> 01:39:39.473
THE DATE. BUT IT'S BEING

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.942
RECONSIDERED AND AS LONG AS IT'S

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:42.976
CONTINUING TO HAVE THE INTENDED

01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:46.814
EFFECT OF- OF. GETTING BETTER

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:49.083
THE LONG DWELL CONTAINERS MOVED

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:50.517
OUT OF THE TERMINALS. WILL

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:52.653
CONTINUE TED TO POSTPONE IT

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.921
BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING AS IT

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:57.024
AS INTENDED. THE OTHER RATE

01:39:57.091 --> 01:40:00.294
THAT- YOU MENTIONED IT IS

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:02.796
FEARED- THAT CLEAN TRUCK FIND

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:05.966

AT THE TERMINALS. IF THEY DON'T

01:40:18.278 --> 01:40:19.747
MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS SO THEY

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:21.248

THE RAPPER FROM THROUGH THE RATE

AMOUNT OF DRUG ACTIVITY AND THE

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:52.873
TRUCKS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.441
PAYING THE RATE WE'RE

FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT

01:42:19.733 --> 01:42:21.969
THE MOST- FINAL FINAL QUESTION

01:42:22.035 --> 01:42:23.403
IS FOR ANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:24.905

KNOW THAT THERE'S- IT'S STILL A

01:42:33.146 --> 01:42:34.314
LITTLE MURKY IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:35.883
THE COST TO COST DIFFERENTIALS

01:42:35.949 --> 01:42:37.818
ARE FOR CHARGING HEAVY DUTIES

01:42:37.885 --> 01:42:39.253
AND FOR THE ACTUAL TRUCKS

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:41.488
THEMSELVES. AND WHAT THAT MEANS

01:42:41.555 --> 01:42:42.856
FOR THE TRUCK DRIVERS THAT ARE

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:44.591
IN AND AROUND THE PORTS- BUT

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:47.160

WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE

01:43:06.046 --> 01:43:08.015
MAGNITUDE OF THE CHANGE THAT

01:43:08.081 --> 01:43:09.616
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:43:09.683 --> 01:43:11.385
IMPLEMENTING THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:13.253

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:15.228
PUT AN INFRASTRUCTURE WE BUILT

01:52:15.295 --> 01:52:17.063
TO PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS IN

01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:18.765
THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. AND

01:52:18.832 --> 01:52:20.700
WE'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING WITH

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:22.936
SEVERAL OTHERS ABOUT BUILDING

01:52:23.002 --> 01:52:24.504
OUT ADDITIONAL ONES THERE ARE A

01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:25.872
LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH PUTTING

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:28.308
IN THESE CHARGERS A LOT OF

01:52:28.374 --> 01:52:29.609
CHALLENGES WORKING IN MULTIPLE

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:32.045
JURISDICTIONS WITH NAVIGATING

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:34.447
THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS

01:52:34.514 --> 01:52:35.782
TO PUT IN HYDROGEN FUELING

01:52:35.849 --> 01:52:38.051
STATIONS AND PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:40.253
CHARGERS. AND SO FROM THE STATE

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:43.423
PERSPECTIVES. HELPING YOU

01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:46.292
ASSEMBLY TATE HE IS AN AND

01:52:46.359 --> 01:52:48.761
MOVING THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO

01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:50.396
THAT WE CAN MORE EASILY

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:52.232
CONSTRUCT AND INSTALL THESE

01:52:52.298 --> 01:52:54.000
TYPES. OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:52:54.067 --> 01:52:55.869
SUPPORT THIS THESE REGIONAL

01:52:55.935 --> 01:52:58.404
TRUCKS IN AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T

01:52:58.471 --> 01:53:01.141
IMPACT THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:03.576
WITH ADDITIONAL TRUCK TRAFFIC.

01:53:03.643 --> 01:53:04.844
IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR US

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:06.713
TO DO THE PLANNING THAT CAN READ

01:53:06.779 --> 01:53:08.014
NEED TO BE AND THEN TO HELP

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:10.049
FACILITATE THE CONSTRUCTION SO

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:11.251
THAT THEY INFRASTRUCTURE CAN

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:18.258
COME ONLINE AS. QUICKLY AS

01:53:18.324 --> 01:53:19.159
POSSIBLE YOUR SUPPORT YET THIS

PASSED THROUGH THIS BODY SB SIX

01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:28.668
SEVENTY ONE A BILL THAT I

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:29.736
AUTHORED CLEAN PRINT CORRIDORS

01:53:29.802 --> 01:53:31.638
IT LOOKS AT FIVE. WITH THE

01:53:31.704 --> 01:53:32.906
INTRODUCTION OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:53:32.972 --> 01:53:34.073
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IT

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.176
LOOKS AT FIVE MOST CONGESTED

01:53:36.242 --> 01:53:38.244
HIGHWAYS- BUT THE NOT JUST THE

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:39.379
FREIGHT CORRIDORS BUT ALSO

01:53:39.445 --> 01:53:40.446
SEGMENTS OF THE QUARTERS THAT

01:53:40.513 --> 01:53:41.714
WOULD SPEAK TO YOUR QUESTION ON

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:42.882
LIKE IN A MORE OF A REGIONAL%

01:53:42.949 --> 01:53:44.450
APPROACH TO LOOKING AT HOW WE

01:53:44.517 --> 01:53:45.818
CAN. DEPLOY ZERO EMISSION

01:53:45.885 --> 01:53:49.322
TECHNOLOGIES AND- AND VEHICLES

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:50.757
SO THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION

01:53:50.823 --> 01:53:52.425
SENATOR RUBIO I SEE NO OTHER

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:53.927
QUESTIONS ON PANEL NUMBER TWO

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:55.295
PANELISTS THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:57.764

PRESENTATIONS WE MOST APPRECIATE

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:02.402
THAT. NOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:54:02.468 --> 01:54:03.970
FINALIZE OUR PRESENTATIONS HERE

01:54:04.037 --> 01:54:05.471
WITH PANEL NUMBER THREE BY

01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:07.507
INDUSTRY. OF THE FIRST PANELIST

01:54:07.574 --> 01:54:09.108
WE HAVE AS MS NICOLE RICE

PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:14.247
NATURAL GAS VEHICLE COALITION.

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:17.016
WELCOME MISS RICE. WELCOME THANK

01:54:17.083 --> 01:54:21.921
YOU MUCH. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR

01:54:21.988 --> 01:54:24.691
ME MADAM CHAIR YES WE CAN. OKAY

01:54:24.757 --> 01:54:27.193
PERFECT- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.895
CHAIR MEMBERS OF ONCE AGAIN

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:30.396
NICOLE RICE AND I'M THE

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:31.831
PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:33.800
NATURAL GAS VEHICLE COALITION.

01:54:33.866 --> 01:54:35.668
C. NG C. REALLY APPRECIATES THE

01:54:35.735 --> 01:54:37.270
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DISCUSSION

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:39.339
TODAY WE FEEL THAT IT IS

01:54:39.405 --> 01:54:41.441
EXTREMELY TIMELY AT THIS

01:54:41.507 --> 01:54:43.476
PARTICULAR JUNCTURE IN THE CLEAN

01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:45.778
TRANSPORTATION TRANSITION JUST

01:54:45.845 --> 01:54:46.546
FOR THE REASONS THAT WE TALK

01:54:46.613 --> 01:54:48.815
ABOUT TODAY. THAT'S A LONGER

01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:51.651
TERM STRATEGY SEEMS SET BUT WHAT

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:53.319
WE DO IN THE NEAR TERM. AND

01:54:53.386 --> 01:54:55.288
THERE'S BEFORE I GO INTO MY

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:56.222
PREPARED AB WHOSE INFORMATION

01:54:56.289 --> 01:54:57.624
NETWORK COUPLE THINGS THAT I

01:54:57.690 --> 01:54:59.792
WANTED TO ADDRESS. FIRST AND

01:54:59.859 --> 01:55:00.793
FOREMOST I WANT TO BE CLEAR

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.762
THAT. THIS IS NOT A CHOICE

01:55:02.829 --> 01:55:06.366
BETWEEN ZERO AND NEAR ZERO. THIS

01:55:06.432 --> 01:55:09.135
IS ABOUT DIESEL VERSUS CLEANER

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:11.604
ALTERNATIVES AND WHEN THE TIME

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:15.275
OF THOSE TURNS WITH EASE OF ALL

01:55:15.341 --> 01:55:16.843
. THE ALTERNATIVE TO THROUGH

01:55:16.909 --> 01:55:18.478
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS HEALTH

01:55:18.544 --> 01:55:21.247
TRUST ISN'T ELECTRIC. IT'S

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:24.250
DIESEL AND SO IF YOU'RE NOT

01:55:24.317 --> 01:55:26.686
GOING TO BE FINDING ABOUT HER

01:55:26.753 --> 01:55:27.920
DEATH LIKE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:30.456
POWER PLANT DAY THEN BASICALLY

01:55:30.523 --> 01:55:31.824
THE STATE IS WALKING IN THE

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:33.660
CHOICE OF MEANS ALL WORK LEAD

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:37.263
OVER. OWNERS FOR THE FORESEEABLE

01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:38.965
FUTURE. INFRASTRUCTURE THIS

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:40.900
TECHNOLOGY FOR A NATURAL GAS

01:55:40.967 --> 01:55:42.869
VEHICLES AND TRUCKS IS ALREADY

01:55:42.935 --> 01:55:44.904
AFTER IT'S SENT IT'S BEEN FUNDED

01:55:44.971 --> 01:55:46.773
BY THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT BY THE

01:55:46.839 --> 01:55:48.741
COMMUNITY. AND THEY CAN ALSO

01:55:48.808 --> 01:55:50.443
SUPPORT THE TRANSITION TO

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:53.513
HYDROGEN. SO IF ANY OF THE TIME

01:55:53.579 --> 01:55:56.916
LINES OR CAPABILITIES CAPACITIES

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:58.651
OR ABILITIES THAT WE HAVE

01:55:58.718 --> 01:56:01.187
FORECASTED FOR THE FUTURE ARE

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:04.057
WRONG OR OFF. AND THEN WE WILL

01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:06.292
JUST LOSE MORE TIME AND SO

01:56:06.359 --> 01:56:07.493
THAT'S WHY WE THINK THAT IT'S

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:09.462
CRITICAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:56:09.529 --> 01:56:10.763
CONSIDER WHAT THEY WILL DO IN

01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:14.534
THE NEAR TERM AS WELL AS A LONG

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.735
TERM STRATEGY. SO FOR THE

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:16.869
CONCLUSION OF MY COMMENTS ALL

01:56:16.936 --> 01:56:18.504
WRAPPED THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF

01:56:18.571 --> 01:56:20.340
THINGS. FIRST OF ALL WHAT ARE

01:56:20.406 --> 01:56:22.075
THE BENEFITS OF NATURAL GAS

01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:23.843
STRUTS ALSO KNOWN AS LOW NOT

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:27.113
STRUCK NEAR ZERO TRACK. AND

01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:28.614
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT

01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:30.817
DISCUSSION TODAY SO I'LL JUST

01:56:30.883 --> 01:56:32.585
WRAP IT UP BY SIMPLY SAYING.

01:56:32.652 --> 01:56:34.554
UNTIL HEAVY DUTY ZERO EMISSION

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:36.956
TRUCKS ARE TRULY COMMERCIAL

01:56:37.023 --> 01:56:39.292
VIABLE THAT MEANS THAT THEY CAN

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:42.362
OPERATE AS A ONE TO ONE REPLACE.

01:56:42.428 --> 01:56:44.263
THE EXISTING AND DIVERSE DIESEL

01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:47.033
FLEET THEN RENEWABLY YOUR WERE

01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:50.069
NOT TRUST ARE THE BEST EFFECTIVE

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:51.938
AND IMMEDIATE SOLUTION TO

01:56:52.004 --> 01:56:53.806
MEETING CALIFORNIA'S AIR QUALITY

01:56:53.873 --> 01:56:57.643
AND CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. IN THE

01:56:57.710 --> 01:56:58.945
HEAVY DUTY SECTOR. AND WE WERE

01:56:59.011 --> 01:57:00.513
GLAD TO HEAR. THAT YOU'RE

01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:02.281
RANDOLPH BELIEVES THAT THERE IS

01:57:02.348 --> 01:57:04.317
A ROLE FOR ALL TECHNOLOGY TO

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:06.853
CONTINUE IN THIS TRANSITION AND

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:08.187
WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO

01:57:08.254 --> 01:57:10.957
WORK WITH KERR. TO MAKE THAT

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:13.459
HAPPEN. HOW CAN THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:57:13.526 --> 01:57:15.595
HELP THE LEGISLATURE MEET AIR

01:57:15.661 --> 01:57:17.663
QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS

01:57:17.730 --> 01:57:19.232
WELL HERE'S AN EXCITING POINT

01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:21.567
THAT WE JUST RECENTLY LEARNED

01:57:21.634 --> 01:57:22.335
FROM DATA THAT WAS RELEASED BY

01:57:22.402 --> 01:57:24.670
CAR. RELATED TO THE LOW CARBON

01:57:24.737 --> 01:57:27.039
FUEL STANDARD THAT CERTIFIES

01:57:27.106 --> 01:57:28.841
THAT NATURAL GAS USED IN THE

01:57:28.908 --> 01:57:32.078
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS CARBON

01:57:32.145 --> 01:57:35.415
NEGATIVE NOW. SO WHAT THAT MEANS

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:37.850
IS THAT CALIFORNIA ON NATURAL

01:57:37.917 --> 01:57:41.120
GAS VEHICLES ARE ONLY CARBON

01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:42.555
NEGATIVE TRANSPORTATION FUEL

01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:45.224
OPTIONS THAT. CALIFORNIA WANTS

01:57:45.291 --> 01:57:47.226
TO GO CARBON NEUTRAL NOW BEEN

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:51.464
ORANGEY IS THE FEW OPTIONS. AND

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:53.399
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT WELL FOR A

01:57:53.466 --> 01:57:56.135
COUPLE OF REASONS SB THIRTEEN

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.036
EIGHTY THREE REQUIRES THE STATE

01:57:57.103 --> 01:57:59.205
TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM SHORT

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:01.908
REQUIREMENTS WRITTEN AND SIGNED

01:58:01.974 --> 01:58:02.775
TO SEVEN BURKE TODAY HAVE

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:04.310
CONCLUDED THAT THE BEST

01:58:04.377 --> 01:58:06.579
SOLUTION. IS ONE OF THE CONSUMER

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:09.048
WARMING UP THE PLANET IS A RAPID

01:58:09.115 --> 01:58:11.384
REDUCTION OF SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:14.353
POLLUTANTS LIKE METHANE AND

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.589
BLACK CARBON. WE ALSO KNOW THAT

01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:18.791
THIRTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS

01:58:18.858 --> 01:58:20.593
ARE LIVING WITH UNHEALTHY AIR

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.328
MANY AND DISADVANTAGED AND

01:58:22.395 --> 01:58:24.430
MINORITY COMMUNITIES SO GETTING

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:28.100
IMMEDIATE NEAR TERM RELIEF THOSE

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:30.269
INDIVIDUALS IS IMPORTANT. SIMPLY

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:31.804
ALLOWING DIESEL TO BE THE

01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:33.606
DEFAULT IN THE ABSENCE OF

01:58:33.673 --> 01:58:35.675
COMMERCIAL READY EVIDENCE

01:58:35.741 --> 01:58:37.643
MISSIONS FACT WHEN CLEANER

01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:39.912
TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE NOW IS

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:41.581
INCONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S

01:58:41.647 --> 01:58:44.083
CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES AND ITS

01:58:44.150 --> 01:58:47.854
DESIRE FOR A HEALTHY STATE AND

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.489
HEALTHY CALHOUN. SO I'LL CLOSE

01:58:49.555 --> 01:58:51.424
BY SAYING AGAIN THAT THE CURRENT

01:58:51.491 --> 01:58:53.493
CHOICE THAT WE OPERATORS ARE

01:58:53.559 --> 01:58:56.028
MAKING TODAY IS NOT BETWEEN YOU

01:58:56.095 --> 01:58:58.431
HEARING MISSION AND THE

01:58:58.498 --> 01:58:59.832
AVAILABILITY OF LOW KNOCKS AND

01:58:59.899 --> 01:59:03.035
GETS. ITS BETWEEN DIESEL AND A

01:59:03.102 --> 01:59:06.606
CLEANER AVAILABLE AND RELIABLE

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:09.609
ALTERNATE. IT I CAN'T STRESS

01:59:09.675 --> 01:59:10.910
ENOUGH THAT REPORTING MORE LOW

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:13.045
KNOCKS TRACK IT'S NOT GOING TO

01:59:13.112 --> 01:59:15.414
SLOW DOWN THE ADOPTION OF A ZERO

01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:17.884
A ZERO EMISSION STRATEGY THAT IS

01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:19.685
THE STATE'S LONG TERM STRATEGY

01:59:19.752 --> 01:59:22.255
WHAT WE NEED NOW IS A NEAR TERM

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:24.323
STRATEGY. AND ABSENT AN

01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:26.459
ALTERNATIVE WHICH WILL CONTINUE

01:59:26.526 --> 01:59:28.494
TO BUY DIESEL AND THE PROBLEMS

01:59:28.561 --> 01:59:30.029
THAT THE POLICIES WERE TO

01:59:30.096 --> 01:59:34.000
ADDRESS. AND SAW WHAT WE GET

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:34.600
WORKS. ONCE THE STATE WAITING

01:59:34.667 --> 01:59:37.136
FOR THE NEXT BEST TECHNOLOGY MS

01:59:37.203 --> 01:59:38.471
RICE IF WHATEVER HAPPENS- I'M

01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:39.906
SORRY WE'VE GONE PAST THE THREE

01:59:39.972 --> 01:59:41.340
MINUTES THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:59:41.407 --> 01:59:44.577
ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY JUST A

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:46.746
FEW JUST A LASSEN. EVERY YEAR

01:59:46.812 --> 01:59:48.981

RIGHT SO JUMPING AND WILL KICK

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.229
THINGS OFF WITH FUEL CELL VERY

02:00:37.296 --> 02:00:39.098
ATTRACTIVE. THIS SEGMENT OF

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:40.099
HEAVY DUTY IS IN THE PRE

02:00:40.166 --> 02:00:41.701
COMMERCIALIZATION PHASE I'VE

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.669
MENTIONED EARLIER THE STRUCTURE

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:45.304
CAPABLE OF CARRYING A FULLY

02:00:45.371 --> 02:00:47.039
LOADED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND

02:00:47.106 --> 02:00:48.708
POUNDS OF GOOD. MILEAGE VARIES

02:00:48.774 --> 02:00:51.043
ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED

02:00:51.110 --> 02:00:51.978
TO FIVE HUNDRED MILES AND THE

02:00:52.044 --> 02:00:53.112
TORQUE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:00:53.179 --> 02:00:54.914
PLATFORM ALLOWS FOR BETTER

02:00:54.981 --> 02:00:57.116
MERGING AND PASSING ON HIGHWAYS

02:00:57.183 --> 02:00:58.985
REAL VALUE ADD WHEN WE CONSIDER

02:00:59.051 --> 02:01:00.486
HOW TERRIBLY EVERYBODY'S DRIVING

02:01:00.553 --> 02:01:02.254
THESE DAYS. THE REAL VALUE

02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:03.322
PROPOSITION FOR FEELS ALL

02:01:03.389 --> 02:01:04.557
TRACTORS IN THE HIGH RATE OF

02:01:04.624 --> 02:01:06.759
UTILIZATION REFUELING TAKES

02:01:06.826 --> 02:01:08.194
ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN TO

02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:09.362
TWENTY MINUTES ALLOWING THESE

02:01:09.428 --> 02:01:11.497
TRUCKS TO BE UTILIZED 95% OF THE

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:13.532
TIME. VEHICLE COSTS ARE NOT

02:01:13.599 --> 02:01:15.034
WIDELY AVAILABLE AT THAT POINT

02:01:15.101 --> 02:01:17.069
MARKET DEVELOPMENT AS NOTED WERE

02:01:17.136 --> 02:01:19.305
IN A PRE COMMERCIAL FAITH THAT%

02:01:19.372 --> 02:01:20.473
ALL OF WILLIAM'S ARE STRIVING

02:01:20.539 --> 02:01:21.641
FOR COST. CHARITY THE TEETH ALL

02:01:21.707 --> 02:01:24.276
OPERATIONAL COSTS THEY CAN BE UP

02:01:24.343 --> 02:01:25.277
250% OF THE TOTAL COST OF

02:01:25.344 --> 02:01:27.079
OWNERSHIP AND TO THAT END WE

02:01:27.146 --> 02:01:28.614
WOULD RECOMMEND YOU AREA TO

02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:30.716
FOCUS ON. FIRST DECREASING THE

02:01:30.783 --> 02:01:32.785
COST OF HYDROGEN FUEL CURRENTLY

02:01:32.852 --> 02:01:34.420
ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWELVE TO

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:35.888
SIXTEEN DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:37.957
VERY EXCITED ABOUT- PRESIDENT BY

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:40.026
IN HYDROGEN BURKE SHOT TRYING TO

02:01:40.092 --> 02:01:41.861
GET HYDROGEN Q. A DOLLAR PER

02:01:41.927 --> 02:01:43.729
KILOGRAM BY TWENTY THIRTY. BUT

02:01:43.796 --> 02:01:45.498
ALSO WE WANT TO DO MORE TO

02:01:45.564 --> 02:01:47.333
ENCOURAGE IN STATE RENEWABLE

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.435
HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TO BUILD OUT

02:01:49.502 --> 02:01:52.571
OUR- SUPPLY OF FUEL BURNING DOWN

02:01:52.638 --> 02:01:54.774
**** A QUICK MAN IN COMPONENT

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.175
COSTS ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT

02:01:56.242 --> 02:01:57.610
PART OF THE TOTAL COST OF

02:01:57.677 --> 02:01:59.712
OWNERSHIP. AND HERE IS WHERE WE

02:01:59.779 --> 02:02:00.980
CONSIDER THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN

02:02:01.047 --> 02:02:02.548
HEAVY DUTY AND LIGHT DUTY THE

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:04.283
CLASS EIGHT TRUCKS THAT IS

02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:05.851
OPERATING OUT OF THE PORT OF LA

02:02:05.918 --> 02:02:07.720
IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER

02:02:07.787 --> 02:02:09.388
IT'S ACTUALLY TWO PASSENGER

02:02:09.455 --> 02:02:11.390
VEHICLE MIRAI FUEL CELL STACKS

02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:13.292
PUT TOGETHER. AND SO WHEN WE

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:15.261
COMPARE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION

02:02:15.327 --> 02:02:17.563
PASSENGER VEHICLE PERSON ABOUT A

02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:19.298
MILLION AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES

02:02:19.365 --> 02:02:21.534
IN THE STATE WHAT WE FIND IS

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.269
THAT BY SCALING UP THE

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:26.072
PRODUCTION OF LIGHT DUTY THE

02:02:26.138 --> 02:02:27.406
COLD WE CAN DRIVE DOWN THE

02:02:27.473 --> 02:02:29.809
VEHICLE COSTS AT THE HEAVY DUTY

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:37.349
TRUCKS. CONVERSELY THESE TRUCKS

02:02:37.416 --> 02:02:38.918
HAVE A BIG DEMAND ON HIGH. FUEL

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:41.153
THAT I WE UP TO MEET THE PRICE

02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:42.855
DROP FOR EVERY DRIVING ON THE-

02:02:42.922 --> 02:02:44.657
VEHICLE. AND EVERYBODY AGREE

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:46.025
THAT IN. IN THE FIELD ELECTRIC

02:02:46.092 --> 02:02:48.828
COMMUNITY MUST PRECEDE VEHICLES

02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:50.129
. THEY'RE THE KIND OF CATCH

02:02:50.196 --> 02:02:50.996
TWENTY TWO THAT EXIST FOR

02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:52.565
HYDROGEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT

02:02:52.631 --> 02:02:54.166
FUNDING LATER BUT THE PCS

02:02:54.233 --> 02:02:56.235
ALLOCATING MORE THAN 70% OF ITS

02:02:56.302 --> 02:02:58.170
DOLLARS TO BATTERY TRACKS.

02:02:58.237 --> 02:02:59.238
BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE PURCHASE

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:01.974
ORDERS. GETTING LARGE VOLUMES OF

02:03:02.041 --> 02:03:04.009
FUEL CELL OUR PURCHASE ORDER

02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:06.045
ORDERS REQUIRES AN ABSOLUTE

02:03:06.112 --> 02:03:08.047
ASSURANCE THAT A FUELING NETWORK

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:09.782
WILL BE AVAILABLE WHICH WE CAN'T

02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:11.717
DO UNTIL WE HAVE MORE PURCHASE

02:03:11.784 --> 02:03:13.419
ORDERS TO SELL IT FACT TRAP THAT

02:03:13.486 --> 02:03:15.821
HYDROGEN ALL. GET STUCK IN AND

02:03:15.888 --> 02:03:18.157
TO BE QUITE FRANK IT'S VERY- ON

02:03:18.224 --> 02:03:20.493
ARE REMINISCENT OF WHAT THE

02:03:20.559 --> 02:03:21.460
LIGHT DUTY MARKET IS GOING

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:23.796
THROUGH. SO WE'LL CHAT MORE A

02:03:23.863 --> 02:03:28.734
LITTLE BIT. A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:31.504
ABOUT OFFICIALLY. SEVENTY THREE-

02:03:31.570 --> 02:03:33.405
O. G. YOU'RE HIDING MOBILE AND

02:03:33.472 --> 02:03:34.406
HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO PROVE THE

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:35.407
VALUE PROP. IF YOU'LL FOLLOW

02:03:35.474 --> 02:03:36.809
ELECTRIC. REPUBLICAN THEN AN

02:03:36.876 --> 02:03:39.044
OPERATION SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:40.045
BEFORE COURSE THEY'D HAVE AN

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:41.947
OPERATING CONDITION PUTTING THE

02:03:42.014 --> 02:03:43.916
SAME AMOUNT OF MILEAGE IN ONE

02:03:43.983 --> 02:03:45.551
YEAR AT A FUEL CELL VEHICLE DOES

02:03:45.618 --> 02:03:47.787
IN A LIFETIME BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:03:47.853 --> 02:03:49.688
OPERATING 99% OF THE TIME.

RANGE. FOR THIS COMMUNITY

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:24.884
HYDROGEN FUEL COSTS- PRIORITY SO

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:26.151
AS WE DISCUSSED WITH DRAYAGE

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:28.087
TRUCKS THE HYDROGEN OR CHAU IN

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:29.822
INCREASING STATE PRODUCTION

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:31.190
CRITICAL OBJECTIVES FOR THIS

02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:32.958
COMMUNITY THANK YOU MISS COOK IF

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:33.993
WE CAN JUST WRAP UP HERE THAT

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:35.494
WOULD BE GREAT WE'RE PASSED THE

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:37.129
THREE WORDS WE APPRECIATED. NOT

02:05:37.196 --> 02:05:38.631
A PROBLEM I AM I THINK THERE'S

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:40.032
BEEN SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:05:40.099 --> 02:05:41.400
NOTHING THAT FEDERAL WE CAN GO

02:05:41.467 --> 02:05:42.568
AHEAD AND GET IT SO I WOULD JUST

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:44.436
ADD INCLUDING THAT ADDING

02:05:44.503 --> 02:05:46.472
TOGETHER ALL STATE SPENDING ON

02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:48.574
YOUR MACHINE VEHICLES. LESS THAN

02:05:48.641 --> 02:05:50.242
5% OF THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE

02:05:50.309 --> 02:05:52.077
GOING TOWARD HYDROGEN DESPITE

02:05:52.144 --> 02:05:53.345
THE VALUE THAT IT BRINGS TO

02:05:53.412 --> 02:05:55.581
HEAVY DUTY AND AT THE AARP

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:57.716
RECOMMENDS 20% OF PASSENGER

02:05:57.783 --> 02:06:00.519
VEHICLE. I'M SO THE COMMITTEE

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:03.322
ASKED WHAT WOULD OUR SUGGESTION

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:05.991
B. Q. ELIMINATE BURIAL TO

02:06:06.058 --> 02:06:07.660
COMMERCIALIZATION AND SO MY

02:06:07.726 --> 02:06:09.061
ANSWER TO THAT WOULD BE WE NEED

02:06:09.128 --> 02:06:10.763
TO STOP LIMITING HYDROGEN INTO A

02:06:10.829 --> 02:06:13.132
SMALL AFTERTHOUGHT. ONLY BE USED

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:14.600
WHEN WE'VE EXHAUSTED ALL OUR

02:06:14.667 --> 02:06:16.101
TIME AND RESOURCES FORCING

02:06:16.168 --> 02:06:26.211
BATTERY. CREATING. POLICIES THAT

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:27.079
ALLOW HYDROGEN JUST SCALE CREATE

02:06:27.146 --> 02:06:29.715
ALL. AND BE WITH NOW THREE OUT

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:30.582
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. THREE

02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:31.850
TECHNOLOGIES BECOME TO COME. AND

02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:33.152
STAND ON THE OWN I DON'T BE WHY

02:06:33.218 --> 02:06:35.154
THEY- TO ALL HELLO. RIGHT THANK

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:36.221
YOU BETTER YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

ONLY ARE THE TRUCKS HERE BUT THE

02:08:30.969 --> 02:08:33.505
TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING SO FAST

02:08:33.572 --> 02:08:35.174
THAT THERE'S A TOOL AVAILABLE TO

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.675
HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED

02:08:36.742 --> 02:08:37.843
IN TRUCK DRIVERS AND FLEETS THAT

02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:38.844
ARE INTERESTED IN ELECTRIC

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:40.746
VEHICLES. FIND THE RIGHT TRUCK

02:08:40.813 --> 02:08:42.648

PRETEND LIKE WE'RE NOT IN THE

02:08:43.715 --> 02:08:44.983
EARLY STAGES OF

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:47.319
COMMERCIALIZATION BECAUSE WE ARE

02:08:47.386 --> 02:08:49.488
BUT SENATOR DOLLY SAID EARLIER

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:50.856
YOU WERE ONLY FOURTEEN YEARS

02:08:50.923 --> 02:08:52.524
AWAY AND I WOULD JUST SUGGEST

02:08:52.591 --> 02:08:54.493
THAT FOURTEEN YEARS IS A VERY

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:57.096
VERY LONG TIME AND IN THIS IN

02:08:57.162 --> 02:08:58.664
THIS WORLD AND THE DIFFERENCE

02:08:58.730 --> 02:09:00.466
BETWEEN WHERE WE WERE FOURTEEN

02:09:00.532 --> 02:09:01.467
YEARS AGO ON ELECTRIC

02:09:01.533 --> 02:09:02.968
TRANSPORTATION WHICH WAS PRETTY

02:09:03.035 --> 02:09:04.770
MUCH KNOW WHERE. AND WHERE WE

02:09:04.837 --> 02:09:09.608
ARE TODAY. IS PRETTY. THE

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:10.776
AMAZING SO I JUST WANT I WANT TO

02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:12.311
MAKE SURE IT KNEW THAT THERE WAS

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:13.946
TOOL THERE AND THEN I ALSO

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:14.880
PROVIDE HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE IT A

02:09:14.947 --> 02:09:16.882
HANDOUT. FOR THE COMMITTEE TO

02:09:16.949 --> 02:09:20.285
CONSIDER BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES.

02:09:20.352 --> 02:09:22.721
PEOPLE POINT TO THE GRID AS A

02:09:22.788 --> 02:09:25.557
CHALLENGE TO ELECTRIFICATION.

02:09:25.624 --> 02:09:27.192
AND I JUST WANT TO. SHE SAID

02:09:27.259 --> 02:09:28.193
THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:29.862
STUDIES AND SOME OF THEM ARE

02:09:29.928 --> 02:09:31.797
LAID OUT IN YOUR HAND OUT. THAT

02:09:31.864 --> 02:09:34.099
SHOW THAT LEAKING THESE TRUCKS

02:09:34.166 --> 02:09:36.335
TO THE GRAND CAN BE A TREMENDOUS

02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:39.271
BENEFIT FOR THE GREG. FOR SAFETY

02:09:39.338 --> 02:09:41.240
FOR A LIABILITY AS WE WORK ON

02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:42.975
RESILIENCY AND COMBATING

02:09:43.041 --> 02:09:45.010
WILDFIRES THESE TRUCKS

02:09:45.077 --> 02:09:46.845
CONNECTING TO THE GRID CAN MAKE

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:48.514
OUR GRID MORE RESILIENT

02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:50.916
PARTICULARLY AS- THE FLEET TURNS

02:09:50.983 --> 02:09:52.784
OVER RATHER SLOWLY SO THERE IS

02:09:52.851 --> 02:09:54.820
THIS KIND OF GRADUAL TURNOVER IN

02:09:54.887 --> 02:09:58.190
THE FLEET. AND THIS IS NOT A NEW

02:09:58.257 --> 02:10:00.692
CHALLENGE FOR UTILITIES- THE

02:10:00.759 --> 02:10:02.995
UTILITY INDUSTRY THE GRID ITSELF

02:10:03.061 --> 02:10:06.832
IS AN ENGINEERING. FEAT THAT IS

02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:09.468
EVER OF ALL- AND SO THIS KIND OF

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:12.070
NEW LOAD IS NOT NEW FOR THE

02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:14.640
GRANT WE HAVE. IT THAT THESE

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:16.542
KINDS OF CHALLENGES ARE NOT NEW

02:10:16.608 --> 02:10:18.844
IN FACT THEY CAN OFTEN BE.

02:10:18.911 --> 02:10:21.013
BENEFICIAL TO THE GREAT AND ALL

02:10:21.079 --> 02:10:23.282
CUSTOMERS WHO USE ELECTRICITY

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:24.283
WHETHER OR NOT YOU DRIVE A

02:10:24.349 --> 02:10:26.752
TRUCK. SO FOR JUST TO GIVE YOU

02:10:26.818 --> 02:10:29.488
AN EXAMPLE OVER THE LAST DECADE.

02:10:29.555 --> 02:10:30.789
MARGARET IN CALIFORNIA HAS

02:10:30.856 --> 02:10:32.658
SHIFTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO A

02:10:32.724 --> 02:10:36.395
RELIANCE ON RENEWABLE RESOURCES

02:10:36.461 --> 02:10:38.096
SOLAR AND WIND HEADED HAVE

02:10:38.163 --> 02:10:39.331
EXPANDED. ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:41.533
THE STATE HAVE X. HAS EXPANDED

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:44.703
SO THIS TRANSITION CAN NOT ONLY

02:10:44.770 --> 02:10:47.706
BE ON BE. BENEFIT THE GREAT BUT

02:10:47.773 --> 02:10:49.675
IT IS POSSIBLE IN PART BECAUSE

02:10:49.741 --> 02:10:50.809
BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A

02:10:50.876 --> 02:10:52.678
GRADUAL TRANSITION AND IT ISN'T

02:10:52.744 --> 02:10:56.748
A NEW THIS IS NOT NEW TO WORK

02:10:56.815 --> 02:10:58.283
FOR THE GREAT. SO I DON'T WANT

02:10:58.350 --> 02:10:58.917
TO UNDERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF

02:10:58.984 --> 02:11:01.987
WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO NOT JUST

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:03.222
TO BRING ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND

02:11:03.288 --> 02:11:05.224
CONNECT THEM. TO THE GRANT BUT

02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:07.426
ACTUALLY ALL OF OUR EFFORTS TO

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:09.461
ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:12.331
COMBAT WILDFIRES WHILE ALSO

02:11:12.397 --> 02:11:14.166
MAKING SURE THAT ELECTRICITY IN

02:11:14.233 --> 02:11:16.468
CALIFORNIA IS MORE AFFORDABLE

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:18.370
AND SAFE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:20.539
SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:23.208
SAYING WHEN YOU HEAR THINGS

02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:26.411
LIKE- YOU KNOW THE GREAT CAN'T

02:11:26.478 --> 02:11:27.713
HANDLE THIS OR THERE ARE ALL

02:11:27.779 --> 02:11:29.748
THESE GREAT CHALLENGES. I WOULD

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:32.351
JUST ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO USE

02:11:32.417 --> 02:11:34.353
PLEASE TALK TO UTILITIES TO THE

02:11:34.419 --> 02:11:37.356
EXPERTS TO THE ENGINEERS WHO WHO

02:11:37.422 --> 02:11:39.925
KNOWS THE FACTS SO YES WE DO WE

02:11:39.992 --> 02:11:41.493
ARE FACING A LOT OF CHALLENGES

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.762
IN CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE LARGELY

02:11:43.829 --> 02:11:45.631
DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE BUT I

02:11:45.697 --> 02:11:47.766
WOULD POSIT THAT ELECTRIC

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:49.868
VEHICLES CONNECTING TO THE GRID

02:11:49.935 --> 02:11:52.571
ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND-

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:54.306
I'M NOT THE HYDROGEN PERSON BUT

02:11:54.373 --> 02:11:55.707
I THINK HYDROGEN IS ALSO

02:11:55.774 --> 02:11:56.708
ELECTRIC VEHICLE ON THEIR

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:59.678
TREMENDOUS- THAT. STORAGE

02:11:59.745 --> 02:12:02.080
CAPACITY SESSION WITH HYDROGEN

02:12:02.147 --> 02:12:04.883
SO THESE VEHICLES ACTUALLY CAN

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:06.952
SUPPORT OUR GREAT EFFORTS AND

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:08.553
THEY'RE COMING ONLINE FASTER

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.589
THAN ANYONE EXPECTED WITH

02:12:10.656 --> 02:12:12.658
TECHNOLOGY AND DATA ENHANCEMENTS

02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:14.593
THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE SO

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.795
WE HAVE CHALLENGES. THAT THERE'S

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:18.697
A LOT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DO

02:12:18.764 --> 02:12:20.799
NOT. AND ACTUALLY YOU BACK TO A

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:23.101

TREASURE CHEST OF ENERGY AS WE

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:41.146
OPEN THAT TREASURE CHEST WE HAVE

02:13:41.213 --> 02:13:42.447
TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING AND I

WEATHERED BE ELECTRIC FUEL CELL

02:13:46.084 --> 02:13:47.886
ENERGY WHATEVER IT IS NATURAL

02:13:47.953 --> 02:13:50.355
GAS IT ALL HAS TO BE PART. OF

IT SEEMS THAT THE HYDROGEN. TO

02:14:05.737 --> 02:14:07.606
BE THE ANSWER FOR NUMBER OF

02:14:07.672 --> 02:14:09.207

HOW COULD THE INDUSTRY WORKED TO

02:14:15.947 --> 02:14:17.149
BRING THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL

02:14:17.215 --> 02:14:20.385
PRICES DOWN- TO A REGIONAL ABOUT

02:14:20.452 --> 02:14:22.287
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT MARKET-

02:14:22.354 --> 02:14:23.755
NUMBER OF THAT GREAT MARKET

02:14:23.822 --> 02:14:25.056
NUMBER WOULD KICK RULING THINGS

02:14:25.123 --> 02:14:28.427
OFF. AT SIX DOLLARS A KILOGRAM.

02:14:28.493 --> 02:14:30.695
YES THAT WOULD. ANOTHER GREAT

02:14:30.762 --> 02:14:33.532
QUESTION SENATOR- SO I FULLY

02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:34.933
AGREE THAT WE CAN GET SPEND MUCH

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.602
TIME ON THE WAY VISUAL OF ALL

02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:39.771
THE NEW PRODUCTION COMING INTO

02:14:39.838 --> 02:14:41.306
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:43.141
VERY VERY EXCITING. FOR A LONG

02:14:43.208 --> 02:14:44.643
TIME I THINK WE'VE BEEN KINDA

02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:47.245
HIT WITH- YOU KNOW FRUSTRATION

02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:50.248
ABOUT RELIANCE ON OUT OF STATE-

02:14:50.315 --> 02:14:53.218
ISSUED SO THAT A LOT AND YOU

02:14:53.285 --> 02:14:57.055
KNOW CREATING AND- STATE WHERE.

02:14:57.122 --> 02:14:59.925
THESE SORTS OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS

02:14:59.991 --> 02:15:03.195
ARE MOST WELCOME AND Q. AND YOU

02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:04.729
KNOW USE THAT OPPORTUNITY WITH

02:15:04.796 --> 02:15:06.932
THE HYDROGEN HUB. USE THE GOOD

02:15:06.998 --> 02:15:09.067
WORK AT THE SCENE CARE BE DOING

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:11.937
AND GO BAD ARGUING TO CREATE NEW

02:15:12.003 --> 02:15:13.472
PRODUCTION SITES THROUGHOUT THE

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:16.274
STATE SO THAT WE HAVE PRODUCTION

02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:18.043
IN LINE TO SUPPORT THE NEXT

02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:19.744
GENERATION OF HYDROGEN

02:15:19.811 --> 02:15:21.480
APPLICATION THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:15:21.546 --> 02:15:23.114
ABOUT LIKE RAIL AND MARINE

02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:25.350
AVIATION AND A OT. OF STUFF. I

02:15:25.417 --> 02:15:26.718
HAVEN'T YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN

02:15:26.785 --> 02:15:28.653
NEED ABOUT THE IDEA. INVESTMENT

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:31.289
TAX CREDIT- BEING SORT OF A SHOT

02:15:31.356 --> 02:15:32.491
IN THE ARM SHOULD THAT

02:15:32.557 --> 02:15:33.825
PRODUCTION INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY

02:15:33.892 --> 02:15:35.260
WHEN WE WANT TO PRIORITIZE

02:15:35.327 --> 02:15:37.429
RENEWABLE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION.

02:15:37.496 --> 02:15:39.531
IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COSTLY

02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:41.433
BUT IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW LIKE A

02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:44.836
KEY. ISSUE FOR OUR INDUSTRY- YOU

02:15:44.903 --> 02:15:46.571
KNOW TO BRING TO MARKET SO YOU

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:55.180
KNOW THAT TO BE A COUPLE OPTIONS. THAT OFFER FOR YOUR

02:15:55.247 --> 02:15:56.214
CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MA'AM

02:15:56.281 --> 02:15:57.582
TO GET INTO YOU TO CAN. TO ALL

ARCHULETA THANK YOU FOR THE

02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:06.725
QUESTION SEVEN OR NEWMAN. THANK

02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:08.693
THANK YOU MEASURE GOD COULD VERY

02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:10.896
QUICK QUESTION FOR MISS COOK- IF

02:16:10.962 --> 02:16:13.532
YOU COULD PLEASE EXPAND BRIEFLY

02:16:13.598 --> 02:16:15.400
ON YOU DOWN THE POINT YOU KNOW

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:16.167
IT WHICH IS THE

02:16:16.234 --> 02:16:17.135
INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE

02:16:17.202 --> 02:16:18.236
INTERDEPENDENCY. BETWEEN THE

02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:20.171
LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY BUT

02:16:20.238 --> 02:16:22.674
WHILE ALSO- SPEAK A LITTLE BIT

02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:23.608
TOWARD THE PROCESS OF GREENING

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:27.846
HYDROGEN- AS WE GET TO SCALE. ON

02:16:27.913 --> 02:16:30.882
THIS PLATFORM. ABSOLUTELY AND I

02:16:30.949 --> 02:16:31.917
DID LOOK THROUGH THAT PRETTY

02:16:31.983 --> 02:16:34.586
QUICKLY IT'S GOOD TO HAVE PLAYED

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:35.987
DOWN AND FADE AGAIN. STILL IN

02:16:36.054 --> 02:16:38.323
CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:39.357
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION LIGHT DUTY

02:16:39.424 --> 02:16:40.959
VEHICLES ARE GOING AROUND AND

02:16:41.026 --> 02:16:42.227
WE'VE GOT ABOUT A MILLION HEAVY

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:44.963
DUTY TRUCKS. AND WHAT WE FOUND

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:47.432
FROM THE AUTO MANUFACTURER

02:16:47.499 --> 02:16:51.403
PERSPECTIVE. INSIDES INVESTING

02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:56.675
IN THE FACILITIES THERE- I.

02:16:56.741 --> 02:17:02.414
PROJECT. THAT DEVELOPED. HE WILL

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:04.783
TELL FOR A LADY MARIAH AT A OLD

02:17:04.849 --> 02:17:06.484
WHEN PRODUCED A LOT OF. FOR A

02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:08.153
LOT LADIES VEHICLE FAILED. BACK

02:17:08.219 --> 02:17:10.655
IN ASK DRAWS DOWN THE CAR OF

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:12.424
COMPONENTS IN THE COMPONENT IN

02:17:12.490 --> 02:17:14.392
THE HEAVY DUTY FREE MAKING NOT

02:17:14.459 --> 02:17:16.394
EQUIPMENT LESS COSTLY WHICH

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:21.433
BRINGS DOWN THE OVERALL PRICE AT

02:17:21.499 --> 02:17:23.668
KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO HELP PRODUCT-

02:17:23.735 --> 02:17:26.338
THIRTY KILOGRAM- FUEL TANK ON

02:17:26.404 --> 02:17:28.907
BOARD BURST IS A FIVE KILOGRAM

02:17:28.974 --> 02:17:31.743
TANK ON A LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE SO

02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:34.312
WHEN WE CONSIDERED THE DEMAND

02:17:34.379 --> 02:17:36.047
FOR HYDROGEN FUEL THAT GOING TO

02:17:36.114 --> 02:17:37.549
COMPROMISE THE HEAVY DUTY

02:17:37.616 --> 02:17:40.352
MARKET. NEEDING TO REFILL A

02:17:40.418 --> 02:17:42.153
THIRTY KILOGRAM TANK THAT'S

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:45.090
GOING TO CREATE A DEMAND ON

02:17:45.156 --> 02:17:47.158
HYDROGEN FUEL THAT ENCOURAGES

02:17:47.225 --> 02:17:49.060
PRODUCTION AND THEN NOT DRIVE

02:17:49.127 --> 02:17:52.263
DOWN COSTS. FOR HYDROGEN IT'S

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:53.832
ALWAYS ABOUT SCALING WHETHER

02:17:53.898 --> 02:17:55.200
YOU'RE SCALING BE A QUICK

02:17:55.266 --> 02:17:56.568
MENTION WHETHER YOU'RE SCALING

02:17:56.635 --> 02:17:58.536
THE PRODUCTION OF FUEL THE STATE

02:17:58.603 --> 02:18:00.639
ADMINISTRATION DOC WHEN YOU

02:18:00.705 --> 02:18:03.508
START TO UNLOCK. COST BENEFIT

02:18:03.575 --> 02:18:05.577
AND THEN WE MOVED TO A PLACE OF

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:07.312
BEING EVENTUALLY SELF SUFFICIENT

02:18:07.379 --> 02:18:13.852
AND NOT NEEDING. TO BE

02:18:13.918 --> 02:18:14.686
CONTINUALLY UPSET I'D- I AND

02:18:14.753 --> 02:18:15.987
THEN YOUR QUESTION ABOUT.

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:19.057
ACTIVELY THE GREY. VERY GOOD

02:18:19.124 --> 02:18:21.526
DISCUSSION WHERE I I'M ARE BOARD

02:18:21.593 --> 02:18:23.528
CHER ONE I'M IN THE FIRST HAND

02:18:23.595 --> 02:18:24.262
ALL ABOUT THE DIFFERENT

02:18:24.329 --> 02:18:27.232
RENEWABLE PRODUCTION PATHWAY SO

02:18:27.298 --> 02:18:29.200
YOU HAVE THE ELECTROLYTIC

02:18:29.267 --> 02:18:31.836
HYDROGEN ELECTROLYTES HERS AT

02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:33.538
THAT POINT IN THE MARKET ARE NOT

02:18:33.605 --> 02:18:35.573
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE THEY ARE

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.443
IN THEIR VERY EARLY STAGES- I

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:40.111
SORT OF DEMONSTRATION AND

02:18:40.178 --> 02:18:42.247
DEVELOPMENT SO I WOULD NOT IN

02:18:42.313 --> 02:18:44.315
THAT MOMENT POINTED THAT OUT AS

02:18:44.382 --> 02:18:47.452
THE PRIMARY MEANS TO MAKE YOU'LL

02:18:47.519 --> 02:18:49.888
CONCRETE IMMEDIATELY ARE COST

02:18:49.954 --> 02:18:51.656
COMPETITIVE IMMEDIATELY. BUT YOU

02:18:51.723 --> 02:18:53.058
HAVE TO EITHER HYDROGEN

02:18:53.124 --> 02:18:56.327
PRODUCTION PATHWAYS THAT ARE

02:18:56.394 --> 02:18:57.796
CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE UNDER THE

02:18:57.862 --> 02:18:59.497
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH

02:18:59.564 --> 02:19:01.099
IS THE PROGRAM THAT WE KIND OF

02:19:01.166 --> 02:19:02.767
YOU KNOW THAT OURSELVES

02:19:02.834 --> 02:19:04.369
ACCORDING TO WITH OUR NORTH

02:19:04.436 --> 02:19:06.204
STARKEY WELL I'M AND HAVE BOTH

02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:08.239
OF THOSE PRODUCTION PATHWAYS

02:19:08.306 --> 02:19:10.809
RELY ON ORGANIC WASTE

02:19:10.875 --> 02:19:13.678
AGRICULTURAL WASTE- YOU KNOW

02:19:13.745 --> 02:19:17.315
LANDFILLS AND MUNICIPAL WASTE

02:19:17.382 --> 02:19:20.485
THOSE STREAMS. ARE YOU KNOW AND

02:19:20.552 --> 02:19:22.287
AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER LEFT

02:19:22.353 --> 02:19:24.155
UNTOUCHED ARE JUST GOING TO

02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:25.423
RESULT IN GREATER AND GREATER

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:27.659
METHANE EMISSIONS BUT AS

02:19:27.726 --> 02:19:29.594
CALIFORNIA'S OWN SHORT LIVED

02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:31.029
CLIMATE POLLUTANT BILL AND THEN

02:19:31.096 --> 02:19:32.697
I DIDN'T ADMINISTRATION AND

02:19:32.764 --> 02:19:33.932
ACTION PLAN FOR METHANE

02:19:33.998 --> 02:19:36.134
REDUCTION THOSE TWO PRODUCTION

02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:37.736
PATHWAYS ARE INCREDIBLY

02:19:37.802 --> 02:19:40.205
IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE AND SO THE

02:19:40.271 --> 02:19:41.973
POINT THAT I WAS HOPING TO MAKE

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:43.808
EARLIER IS SOMETIMES THERE'S A

02:19:43.875 --> 02:19:45.443
LOT OF PUSHBACK ON HYDROGEN

02:19:45.510 --> 02:19:48.780
BECAUSE CURRENTLY WE RELY ON YOU

02:19:48.847 --> 02:19:50.582
KNOW CREDIT FOR OUT OF STATE.

02:19:50.648 --> 02:19:51.883
BUT I THINK THAT THE TEMPORARY

02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:53.885
ISSUE AND THE THING THAT'S GOING

02:19:53.952 --> 02:19:55.620
TO RESOLVE BACK IN HAVING OUR

02:19:55.687 --> 02:19:57.288
OWN IN STATE PRODUCTION BUILT

02:19:57.355 --> 02:19:58.623
OUR OWN STATE RENEWABLE

02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:00.525
PRODUCTION BUILT OUT AND THEN

02:20:00.592 --> 02:20:01.693
WE'RE NO LONGER YOU KNOW

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:03.795
INSERTED THAT PUSH AND PULL AND

02:20:03.862 --> 02:20:06.397
WE CAN STAND BY YOU KNOW OUR OUR

02:20:06.464 --> 02:20:08.700
IN STATE VERY CLEAR READY WILL

02:20:08.767 --> 02:20:17.942
ALL PRODUCE HYDROGEN. AND FORMER

02:20:18.009 --> 02:20:20.612
HAD. ENTER YOUR- THAT DOES A DE

02:20:20.678 --> 02:20:22.347
AS SELF CHAIR THE HARSH AND

02:20:22.413 --> 02:20:24.649
CAUCUS I THINK YOU. THANK YOU

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:25.817
SENATOR NEWMAN US OPEN CHAIR

02:20:25.884 --> 02:20:28.486
LEFT- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

02:20:28.553 --> 02:20:29.354
THE QUESTIONS DON'T SEE ANY

02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:30.455
OTHER MIKES BUT I DO HAVE A FEW

02:20:30.522 --> 02:20:32.624
TO BILL OFF THE- LAST ONE

02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:33.525
RELATED TO HYDROGEN I MEAN WE

02:20:33.591 --> 02:20:35.660
TALKED A LOT YOU. YOU BUT A LOT

02:20:35.727 --> 02:20:37.529
OF- EXAMPLES THANK YOU MISS

02:20:37.595 --> 02:20:39.898
COOK. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE DIG

02:20:39.964 --> 02:20:41.900
DEEPER WE SEE THERE ARE OTHER.

02:20:41.966 --> 02:20:44.602
ELEMENTS THAT BECAUSE- I GUESS

02:20:44.669 --> 02:20:46.004
SOME QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF

02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:47.906
STORAGE ISSUES TRANSPORT ISSUES

02:20:47.972 --> 02:20:50.108
ENERGY EFFICIENCY ISSUES. AND SO

02:20:50.175 --> 02:20:51.643
I'D LIKE TO TALK THROUGH THAT A%

02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:53.511
LITTLE BIT JUST TO GET. A SORT

02:20:53.578 --> 02:20:55.947
OF AGLOBAL PICTURE OF WHAT- THE

02:20:56.014 --> 02:20:57.649
STATUS OF HYDROGEN IS CURRENTLY

02:20:57.715 --> 02:20:59.918
IN AND WHY IT'S- I GUESS SO FAR

02:20:59.984 --> 02:21:01.719
BEHIND IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IF

02:21:01.786 --> 02:21:03.721
WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT.

02:21:03.788 --> 02:21:06.124
OTHER- TECHNOLOGIES. AND HOW THE

02:21:06.191 --> 02:21:07.559
LEGISLATURE CAN WILL CONTINUE TO

02:21:07.625 --> 02:21:09.127
WEIGH IN I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WERE

02:21:09.194 --> 02:21:09.994
WEIGHING IN NOW BUT HOW LONG CAN

02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:13.698
WE- LOOK AT HYDROGEN IN THE

02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:14.699
DIFFERENT LANDS RELATED TO THOSE

02:21:14.766 --> 02:21:16.835
ISSUES. BUT A GREAT QUESTION-

02:21:16.901 --> 02:21:19.237
AND SO. I WANT TO POINT TO

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:20.839
SOMETHING THAT I NEED TYPED THAT

02:21:20.905 --> 02:21:23.341
WHICH WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE

02:21:23.408 --> 02:21:25.310
COMMENT MADE BY SENATOR DOLLY

02:21:25.376 --> 02:21:27.378
ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS BEING A

02:21:27.445 --> 02:21:29.280
LONG WAY AWAY. AND YOU KNOW

02:21:29.347 --> 02:21:31.616
HYDROGEN AND THE YOUNGEST OF OUR

02:21:31.683 --> 02:21:34.919
FAMILY HERE- AND SO YOU KNOW WE

02:21:34.986 --> 02:21:37.055
ARE AS I MENTIONED AND NOT PRE

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:40.625
COMMERCIAL PHAE- SO I WOULD SAY

02:21:40.692 --> 02:21:42.093
YOU KNOW GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:44.162
TIME. TO PROVE OUT THE

02:21:44.229 --> 02:21:46.798
APPLICATION OF THE VEHICLES AND

02:21:46.865 --> 02:21:48.733
THEN ONCE WE START TO FEED. MY

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:51.703
BAND HARM FOR DEATH TECHNOLOGY

02:21:51.769 --> 02:21:54.205
PLATFORMS THAT'S WHEN PRIVATE

02:21:54.272 --> 02:21:56.107
INVESTMENT START TO COME TO

02:21:56.174 --> 02:21:59.277
MARKET. AND BE YOU KNOW COSTS

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:01.880
COME DOWN DISTRIBUTION ISSUES

02:22:01.946 --> 02:22:05.283
INVESTED AND- YOU KNOW I TAKE

02:22:05.350 --> 02:22:07.352
YOUR POINT WELL DIED IN THE

02:22:07.418 --> 02:22:10.355
MARKET RIGHT NOW. AND WE DO HAVE

02:22:10.421 --> 02:22:11.856
A PRODUCTION PROBLEM WE HAVE

02:22:11.923 --> 02:22:13.424
THAT WE HAVE AN AVAILABILITY OF

02:22:13.491 --> 02:22:14.492
FUEL PROBLEM IN OUT OF SOMETHING

02:22:14.559 --> 02:22:16.394
THAT I'M COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN

02:22:16.461 --> 02:22:17.962
MENTIONED IN HER TESTIMONY AND-

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:20.632
THAT IS ALSO WHY I'M SO EXCITED.

02:22:20.698 --> 02:22:23.201
ABOUT THE INCREASED PRODUCTION

02:22:23.268 --> 02:22:25.003
THAT COMING TO CALIFORNIA.

02:22:25.069 --> 02:22:27.138
EHRLICH HE'D WILL BE OPENING AT

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:27.972
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

02:22:28.039 --> 02:22:30.074
DOLLAR PRODUCTION FACILITY. THAT

02:22:30.141 --> 02:22:32.043
IS- PRETTY THING THIRTY

02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:34.779
KILOGRAMS OF- EXCUSE ME THIRTY

02:22:34.846 --> 02:22:36.781
TONS OF RENEWABLE HYDROGEN PER

02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:40.251
DAY. THAT WOULD SUPPORT FORTY

02:22:40.318 --> 02:22:41.252
TWO THOUSAND LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE

02:22:41.319 --> 02:22:43.655
OR ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND HEAVY

02:22:43.721 --> 02:22:46.557
DUTY VEHICLES OR- YOU KNOW ABOUT

02:22:46.624 --> 02:22:47.458
SIXTY THOUSAND FOR CLASS AND

02:22:47.525 --> 02:22:49.894
THAT'S NOT BE ONLY. THIRTY TIME

02:22:49.961 --> 02:22:51.963
PER DAY PROJECT THAT COMING TO

02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:53.431
THE WEST COAST WE DON'T HAVE A

02:22:53.498 --> 02:22:55.233
PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT RIGHT

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:57.068
NOW AND SO. I GUESS I WOULD ASK

02:22:57.135 --> 02:22:58.436
SENATOR FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF

02:22:58.503 --> 02:23:01.205
PATIENCE I NEED- YOU KNOW KIND

02:23:01.272 --> 02:23:03.841
OF. GET THROUGH OUR AWKWARD

02:23:03.908 --> 02:23:05.243
TEENAGE YEARS IF YOU WILL SO

02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:07.278
THAT WE ARE ABLE TO COMPETE IN

02:23:07.345 --> 02:23:09.547
THE MARKET. I'M AND THEN OTHER

02:23:09.614 --> 02:23:11.115
RELIEF TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY YOU

02:23:11.182 --> 02:23:19.824
KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE.

02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:20.525
HEAR AN AWFUL LOT THAT. YOU

02:23:20.591 --> 02:23:21.592
KNOW- HYDROGEN THEN YOU KNOW I

02:23:21.659 --> 02:23:23.494
FOR AND IT NOT THE HIGH IN USE

02:23:23.561 --> 02:23:24.762
THAT AT THAT- I THINK WE'RE

02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:25.797
MEANT THE- OF THE POINT IS WHAT

02:23:25.863 --> 02:23:27.799
ARE CAN HUMOR. GOING TEN NEEDED

02:23:27.865 --> 02:23:29.901
WHAT ARE TRUCK DRIVERS GOING TO

02:23:29.968 --> 02:23:32.003
NEED WATER THE PERFORMANCE

02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:35.106
EXPECTATIONS THAT WE AS AS AS

02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:38.242
AUTOMAKERS. HAVE BEEN DELIVERED

02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:40.745
CANNOT. AND INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW

02:23:40.812 --> 02:23:42.180
KIND OF GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE

02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:43.781
ENERGY EFFICIENCY ARGUMENT I

02:23:43.848 --> 02:23:45.183
THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO

02:23:45.249 --> 02:23:47.919
STAY FOCUSED ON WE HAVE A YOU

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:49.420
KNOW TWENTY NINE MILLION DRIVERS

02:23:49.487 --> 02:23:50.755
AND YOU NEED TO GET THEM

02:23:50.822 --> 02:23:52.924
VEHICLES THAT CAN MEET ALL OF

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.659
THEIR DEMANDS- WITH MINIMAL

02:23:54.726 --> 02:23:56.928
SACRIFICES HYDROGEN AND THE ONE

02:23:56.995 --> 02:24:01.265
TO ONE REPLACEMENT. FOR GASOLINE

02:24:01.332 --> 02:24:02.834
AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT.

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:03.868
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE

02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:05.403
APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER- MISS

02:24:05.470 --> 02:24:07.872
COOK- AND THEN MY NEXT QUESTION

02:24:07.939 --> 02:24:11.676
IS FOR- IS RIGHTS RELATED TO-

02:24:11.743 --> 02:24:12.543
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:15.013
PRESENTATION AS WELL. I THINK IN

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:18.116
IN ONE OF YOUR- FLYERS HERE IT

02:24:18.182 --> 02:24:19.684
HAD MENTIONED WHAT COULD BE

02:24:19.751 --> 02:24:20.985
ACHIEVED WITH A ONE HUNDRED

02:24:21.052 --> 02:24:23.388
MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. AND

02:24:23.454 --> 02:24:25.590
IT IT DEPICTS OF THE NUMBER OF

02:24:25.656 --> 02:24:28.893
VEHICLES FUNDED OF VERSES. FOUR

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:30.595
TIMES MORE THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC

02:24:30.661 --> 02:24:33.164
SO TO WHO. I GUESS YOUR SCENARIO

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:35.333
HERE IS TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:36.300
TWENTY TWO RENEWABLE NATURAL

02:24:36.367 --> 02:24:39.937
GAS- TRUCKS. VERSUS SIX HUNDRED

02:24:40.004 --> 02:24:41.139
SIXTY SEVEN BATTERY ELECTRIC

02:24:41.205 --> 02:24:44.142
TRUCKS. AND SO. WHAT IS THE COST

02:24:44.208 --> 02:24:45.410
DIFFERENTIAL I KNOW AGAIN THAT'S

02:24:45.476 --> 02:24:46.744
BEEN A QUESTION WE'VE BEEN

02:24:46.811 --> 02:24:47.879
TALKING ABOUT THROUGH THESE

02:24:47.945 --> 02:24:49.547
PANELS BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:50.748
LIKE IN THIS IS JUST ON THE

02:24:50.815 --> 02:24:52.784
VEHICLES OF COURSE NOT. YOU KNOW

02:24:52.850 --> 02:24:54.619
RETROFITTING OR A CHANGING OF

02:24:54.685 --> 02:24:56.487
ANY OTHER- FUELING STATIONS BUT

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:58.489
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE GIVE US

02:24:58.556 --> 02:25:02.693
A PICTURE- OF WHAT- THIS

02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:05.730
ACTUALLY MEANS. THANK YOU MA'AM

02:25:05.797 --> 02:25:07.298
CHAIR SO IF YOU'RE ASKING THE

02:25:07.365 --> 02:25:09.400
COST DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN. THE

02:25:09.467 --> 02:25:11.035
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES IN THE

02:25:11.102 --> 02:25:14.138
DIFFERENT VEHICLES. SO FOR- A

02:25:14.205 --> 02:25:16.574
DIESEL LIKE I USED TO DIESEL

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:21.746
VEHICLE YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT-

02:25:21.813 --> 02:25:22.580
SIXTY TO EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:25:22.647 --> 02:25:26.084
A TRUCK- AND YOU CAN WE ARE VERY

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:28.653
COMPARABLE TO THAT FOR NATURAL

02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:30.588
GAS IT DOESN'T USE VEHICLES IF

02:25:30.655 --> 02:25:32.256
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A NEW. AND

02:25:32.323 --> 02:25:34.592
IS ON TRACK THAT'S NEED BE-

02:25:34.659 --> 02:25:36.828
CLOSE TO LIKE MAYBE A HUNDRED

02:25:36.894 --> 02:25:39.263
AND FIFTY THOUSAND- AND WE ARE

02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:40.798
VERY COMPARABLE TO THAT. BUT

02:25:40.865 --> 02:25:43.134
ONCE YOU'RE GETTING TO YOU OTHER

02:25:43.201 --> 02:25:45.736
TECHNOLOGIES I'M YOU'RE LOOKING

02:25:45.803 --> 02:25:47.939
AT TWO TO THREE TIMES THE

02:25:48.005 --> 02:25:51.109
AMOUNT. OF THAT CLASS WITH THOSE

02:25:51.175 --> 02:25:53.411
TRACKS AND THAT WAS MENTIONED

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:55.346
EARLIER TODAY AS WELL THAT YOU

02:25:55.413 --> 02:25:57.548
TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT- AND

02:25:57.615 --> 02:25:58.850
THEN AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO

02:25:58.916 --> 02:26:00.852
USE THE HYDROGEN SHOTS. YOU'RE

02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:05.990
LOOKING AT SIGNIFICANT. COST

02:26:06.057 --> 02:26:07.325
INCREASES WELL. OKAY THANK YOU

02:26:07.391 --> 02:26:09.427
THAT- MAR FORMULA THAT YOU'RE

02:26:09.494 --> 02:26:10.928
MENTIONING IS WHAT IS THE HERE

02:26:10.995 --> 02:26:12.463
IN THIS- THAT THIS FIRE BECAUSE

02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:16.100
YOU ALSO- INCLUDE THAT THE KNOX

02:26:16.167 --> 02:26:20.671
REDUCTION ANNUALLY COULD BE- ONE

02:26:20.738 --> 02:26:22.006
HUNDRED THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE

02:26:22.073 --> 02:26:23.274
TONNES WHICH IS FIVE TIMES MORE

02:26:23.341 --> 02:26:24.876
THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC. IS THAT

02:26:24.942 --> 02:26:28.779
CORRECT. I'M SORRY MADAM CHAIR I

02:26:28.846 --> 02:26:30.114
WAS PULLING UP NOT TALKING IT'S

02:26:30.181 --> 02:26:32.950
LIKE IT'S- NOT JUST GIVE ME A

02:26:33.017 --> 02:26:35.987
SECOND LET ME PULL THAT. IS NOT

02:26:36.053 --> 02:26:40.658
ON MY SCREEN. OKAY AND CAN YOU

02:26:40.725 --> 02:26:42.026
ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN I'M HERE

02:26:42.093 --> 02:26:43.828
YES THANK YOU I THINK THAT-

02:26:43.895 --> 02:26:46.497
LEAFLET IS- TITLED CALIFORNIA

02:26:46.564 --> 02:26:47.632
HAS THE WORST AIR POLLUTION IN

02:26:47.698 --> 02:26:48.666
THE NATION AND DIESEL TRUCKS ARE

02:26:48.733 --> 02:26:51.169
LARGELY TO BLAME. AND THERE ARE

02:26:51.235 --> 02:26:53.271
ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS FIVE TIMES

02:26:53.337 --> 02:26:54.438
MORE THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC

02:26:54.505 --> 02:26:55.907
TRUCKS THE BASED ON THE SCENARIO

02:26:55.973 --> 02:26:59.210
OF. TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED

02:26:59.277 --> 02:27:00.378
TWENTY TWO A NATURAL GAS TRUCKS

02:27:00.444 --> 02:27:02.380
ON THE ROAD VERSUS SIX HUNDRED

02:27:02.446 --> 02:27:03.181
SIXTY SEVEN BATTERY ELECTRIC

02:27:03.247 --> 02:27:04.515
TRUCKS I GUESS YOU'RE COMING UP

02:27:04.582 --> 02:27:05.349
WITH THE SCENARIO THAT YOU WOULD

02:27:05.416 --> 02:27:09.587
REDUCE. KNOCKS ANNUALLY ABOUT.

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:10.988
FIVE TIMES MORE THAN BATTERY

02:27:11.055 --> 02:27:12.990
ELECTRIC TRUCKS. THAT THAT IS

02:27:13.057 --> 02:27:15.059
CORRECT OKAY AND THEN GHG

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:17.195
REDUCED ANNUALLY WOULD BE ABOUT

02:27:17.261 --> 02:27:20.765
FOUR TIMES MORE- THAN BATTERY

02:27:20.831 --> 02:27:21.933
ELECTRIC AS WELL. THAT IS

02:27:21.999 --> 02:27:23.868
CORRECT AND THAT'S ALL BASED ON

02:27:23.935 --> 02:27:24.936
A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

02:27:25.002 --> 02:27:26.737
INVESTMENT. CORRECT WE WERE TO

02:27:26.804 --> 02:27:28.773
DO THAT NOW OKAY DO YOU SEE AN

02:27:28.839 --> 02:27:31.542
ANY ADDITIONAL I KNOW LAST YEAR-

02:27:31.609 --> 02:27:33.978
WE HAD WORKED ON- A FORTY FIVE

02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:35.112
MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:38.049
WAS ENACTED THROUGH- OUR BUDGET

02:27:38.115 --> 02:27:40.785
ACTION. AND SO. THIS YEAR I IT

02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:42.553
LOOKS LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:43.454
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT

02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:45.223
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS IN

02:27:45.289 --> 02:27:46.224
ADDITIONAL. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT

02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:48.526
IS. FROM WHAT I'M HEARING FROM

02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:50.428
THE PUBLIC IS. IN WHAT I'VE

02:27:50.494 --> 02:27:52.396
ASKED BEFORE IS WHAT IS THE

02:27:52.463 --> 02:27:56.234
ACTUAL- INAPPROPRIATE INVESTMENT

02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:57.335
FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND I

02:27:57.401 --> 02:27:58.703
THINK I OFTENTIMES ARE LOOKED AT

02:27:58.769 --> 02:27:59.737
AS QUOTE UNQUOTE BRIDGE

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:02.940
TECHNOLOGIES. AGAIN WITH THE

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:03.941
SEVEN TO TEN YEAR STRATEGY

02:28:04.008 --> 02:28:05.610
HORIZON WHILE WE'RE ALSO

02:28:05.676 --> 02:28:07.645
SIMULTANEOUSLY LOOKING AT

02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:09.313
IMPROVING THE INNOVATIONS FOR

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:11.616
ZERO EMISSION. IS THAT YOUR

02:28:11.682 --> 02:28:13.584
UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AND WHAT

02:28:13.651 --> 02:28:16.053
OTHER. DOLLARS WOULD YOU BE-

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:17.755
ADVOCATING FOR FROM THE STATE

02:28:17.822 --> 02:28:21.826
LEGISLATURE. YES WELL- SO WE

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:23.461
FIRST OF ALL AND NURTURE WE

02:28:23.527 --> 02:28:24.996
WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE THIS AS A

02:28:25.062 --> 02:28:27.431
BRIDGE TECHNOLOGY WE THINK THAT

02:28:27.498 --> 02:28:29.200
THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT IS

02:28:29.267 --> 02:28:31.002
AVAILABLE AS I SAID IN MY

02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:33.271
TESTIMONY TO HELP THE STATE MEET

02:28:33.337 --> 02:28:35.006
BOTH AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE

02:28:35.072 --> 02:28:37.408
CHANGE GOALS. SERVICE TECHNOLOGY

02:28:37.475 --> 02:28:40.878
IS AVAILABLE TO CONTINUE TO RUN-

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:42.013
YOU KNOW IT S. AS LONG AS IT IS

02:28:42.079 --> 02:28:44.515
NEEDED AND PROVIDING THOSE

02:28:44.582 --> 02:28:45.883
EMISSION REDUCTIONS INSTANCE ON

02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:48.252
THE IN THE DOCUMENT. CARE ACT

02:28:48.319 --> 02:28:50.421
YOU KNOW NINETY PLUS PERCENT

02:28:50.488 --> 02:28:52.823
EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN CHIEF FOR

02:28:52.890 --> 02:28:56.093
OR NOT NO 100% AND EMISSIONS FOR

02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:59.397
DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER SO- SO

02:28:59.463 --> 02:29:00.931
WE DON'T CHARACTERIZE IT AS

02:29:00.998 --> 02:29:03.434
THAT- HOWEVER. FOR THE

02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:05.770
INVESTMENT INVESTMENT DOLLARS IN

02:29:05.836 --> 02:29:07.872
THE INCENTIVES- THAT SUPPORT OF

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:09.340
THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS NOW

02:29:09.407 --> 02:29:11.642
ONLY THROUGH ONE PROGRAM WHICH

02:29:11.709 --> 02:29:13.477
IS THE CALL MORE YOUR PROGRAM.

02:29:13.544 --> 02:29:15.179
AND WE WERE IN A VARIETY OF

02:29:15.246 --> 02:29:17.548
OTHER PROGRAMS- OVER THE YEARS

02:29:17.615 --> 02:29:20.885
THAT HAVE. SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN AND

02:29:20.951 --> 02:29:23.421
JUST PROVIDED RESOURCES FOR

02:29:23.487 --> 02:29:25.222
INCENTIVE CREDITS AND DOLLARS

02:29:25.289 --> 02:29:27.124
THRILLED THE CARMELITA PROGRAM

02:29:27.191 --> 02:29:28.592
BUT THAT'S REALLY TO HELP WITH

02:29:28.659 --> 02:29:30.027
THE COST DIFFERENTIAL FOR THE

02:29:30.094 --> 02:29:31.128
VEHICLES THAT WE JUST TALKED

02:29:31.195 --> 02:29:32.863
ABOUT AND REALLY GOES TO

02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:35.099
SUPPORT. THESE SMALL FLEET

02:29:35.166 --> 02:29:37.935
OWNERS THOSE WHO HAVE YOU KNOW

02:29:38.002 --> 02:29:40.304
TWO OR FIVE OR TEN TRACKS WHERE

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:42.340
I'M TURNING THOSE TRUCKS OVER

02:29:42.406 --> 02:29:44.308
ISSUE A CLEANER TECHNOLOGY MIGHT

02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:46.544
BE PERSONALLY DESIRABLE BUT A

02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:48.512
LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT FEASIBLE

02:29:48.579 --> 02:29:50.848
ECONOMICALLY. SO WE WOULD

02:29:50.915 --> 02:29:53.551
SUGGEST THAT THE STATE CONTINUES

02:29:53.617 --> 02:29:56.587
TO TAKE ON FRANKLY AT TECHNOLOGY

02:29:56.654 --> 02:29:58.823
NEUTRAL APPROACH Q.

02:29:58.889 --> 02:30:01.692
INCENTIVIZING. THE USE OF THESE

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:04.295
TECHNOLOGIES CONSIDER BOTH NEAR

02:30:04.362 --> 02:30:06.497
TERM AND LONG TERM STRATEGY AND

02:30:06.564 --> 02:30:08.966
AS FAR AS DOLLAR AMOUNTS AS YOU

02:30:09.033 --> 02:30:10.201
MENTIONED THE FORTY FIVE MILLION

02:30:10.267 --> 02:30:12.103
DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED AS A

02:30:12.169 --> 02:30:13.838
BUDGET ALLOCATION LAST YEAR.

02:30:13.904 --> 02:30:16.073
ACCORDING TO YOU AND THE

02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:24.548
DISTRICT A SOUTH. COAST AT&amp;T-

02:30:24.615 --> 02:30:25.416
EARLIER TODAY. WHERE DOES THE

02:30:25.483 --> 02:30:27.017
ARE WITH THE SOUND OFF VALLEY.

02:30:27.084 --> 02:30:29.286
AMERICAN SOLUTION CONTROLLED.

02:30:29.353 --> 02:30:30.755
WOULD ALSO FROM THOSE WE- THAT

02:30:30.821 --> 02:30:33.991
COULD- DISPLAYS ABOUT FOUR

02:30:34.058 --> 02:30:35.526
HUNDRED AND FIFTY TRUCKS IN THE

02:30:35.593 --> 02:30:38.262
DESPERATE SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT

02:30:38.329 --> 02:30:40.664
AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AS MUCH

02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:42.833
RESOURCES AS WOULD BE NEEDED FOR

02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:44.135
A THOUSAND TRAFFIC THE

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:46.537
DISPLACED. BUT IT STARTS MAKING

02:30:46.604 --> 02:30:48.606
PROGRESS AND FOR THE REASONS

02:30:48.672 --> 02:30:49.907
THAT THE STATE WITH THEIR

02:30:49.974 --> 02:30:52.276
FEDERAL AT THE TEAM MADE MANDATE

02:30:52.343 --> 02:30:54.845
IS IMPORTANT- SO THAT GOES TO

02:30:54.912 --> 02:30:57.081
SHOW THAT JUST FORTY FIVE

02:30:57.148 --> 02:30:58.949
MILLION DOLLARS HOW SIGNIFICANT

02:30:59.016 --> 02:31:01.786
THAT IMPACT COULD BE. SO BEING

02:31:01.852 --> 02:31:04.422
ABLE TO YOU ALLOCATE RESOURCES

02:31:04.488 --> 02:31:07.491
ACCORDING TO YOU AIR QUALITY AND

02:31:07.558 --> 02:31:09.760
EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS FOR

02:31:09.827 --> 02:31:11.695
THE NEAR TERM AND THE LONG TERM

02:31:11.762 --> 02:31:13.998
IS THE BEST WAY THAT THE STATE

02:31:14.064 --> 02:31:14.665
COULD PRIORITIZE HOW THOSE

02:31:14.732 --> 02:31:16.600
INVESTMENTS GO. AND AGAIN TO

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:20.471
SUPPORT HELP ME- SMALL LEADS AS

02:31:20.538 --> 02:31:22.239
WELL AS LARGER FLEET OWNERS

02:31:22.306 --> 02:31:24.408
START MAKING THE CHOICES FOR

02:31:24.475 --> 02:31:25.776
CLEAN TECHNOLOGY THAT WE KNOW

02:31:25.843 --> 02:31:27.711
THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE. BUT

02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:28.913
MIGHT BE HAVING FINANCIAL

02:31:28.979 --> 02:31:33.984
DIFFICULTY AND- CONSOLE. GREAT

02:31:34.051 --> 02:31:34.985
THANK YOU MISTER APRIL THAT AND

02:31:35.052 --> 02:31:36.454
I THINK MY HURTS A CALL. A

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:38.689
FOLLOW UP FROM OUR A RESOURCE

02:31:38.756 --> 02:31:40.324

02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:42.226
YOU. SURE THANK YOU SIR I AM

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:43.761

AND INCENTIVES THAT'S ONE OF

02:31:46.063 --> 02:31:46.897
REFLECT IN A FEW OF THE THINGS

02:31:46.964 --> 02:31:47.898
YOU'VE HEARD. THE MOST

02:31:47.965 --> 02:31:49.066
FUNDAMENTAL THING TO SAY IS

02:31:49.133 --> 02:31:50.301
THERE ABOUT A MILLION TRUCKS IN

02:31:50.367 --> 02:31:51.702
CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE REALLY

02:31:51.769 --> 02:31:53.504
TALKING ABOUT IS NOT FUNDS TO

02:31:53.571 --> 02:31:54.939
REPLACE ALL THOSE TRUCKS HAVE TO

02:31:55.005 --> 02:31:56.841
SPEND LIMITED STATE FUNDS. AND

02:31:56.907 --> 02:31:57.975
THEN THE ANSWER IS REALLY CLEAR

02:31:58.042 --> 02:31:59.443
COMBUSTION WHETHER NATURAL GAS

02:31:59.510 --> 02:32:00.945
OR DIESEL IS NOT THE RIGHT

02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:02.646
ANSWER THE BOX THAT. THE STATE

02:32:02.713 --> 02:32:04.114
HAS INVESTED OVER BILLION

02:32:04.181 --> 02:32:05.483
DOLLARS ALREADY I'M IN

02:32:05.549 --> 02:32:07.117
COMMERCIALIZING NATURAL GAS

02:32:07.184 --> 02:32:08.652
VEHICLES THAT'S A SUCCESS.

02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:10.154
THEY'RE AVAILABLE TODAY IN OUR

02:32:10.221 --> 02:32:12.022
DISTRICTS ROUTINE DISCRETION TO

02:32:12.089 --> 02:32:13.724
FUND THEM SO NO ONE'S QUESTION

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:15.493
WHETHER THE MONEY'S OUT THERE. I

02:32:15.559 --> 02:32:16.760
THINK ONE REASON WHY THE CHAIR

02:32:16.827 --> 02:32:18.195
SO HEAVILY EMPHASIZE ZERO

02:32:18.262 --> 02:32:20.331
EMISSION VEHICLES IS THAT WE

02:32:20.397 --> 02:32:21.298
THINK ABOUT HOW TO INVEST

02:32:21.365 --> 02:32:23.601
LIMITED FUNDS AS THE L. A. O. IS

02:32:23.667 --> 02:32:25.169
OBSERVED. WE REALLY NEED TO

02:32:25.236 --> 02:32:26.470
THINK ABOUT IF YOU SEE ONE OF

02:32:26.537 --> 02:32:28.873
THOSE IS HOW IS EQUITY SO HOW

02:32:28.939 --> 02:32:31.175
DEEPLY CAN WE INVEST IN TRUCKS

02:32:31.242 --> 02:32:32.376
THAT WILL STAY ON THE ROAD FOR

02:32:32.443 --> 02:32:33.577
YEARS TO COME IMPACTING

02:32:33.644 --> 02:32:35.279
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THAT

02:32:35.346 --> 02:32:36.514
REALLY MEANS GETTING ZEROS WE

02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:39.250
HEARD MISTER LOGAN. ANOTHER IS

02:32:39.316 --> 02:32:41.352

MANUFACTURERS INVEST MORE ANY

02:32:46.357 --> 02:32:48.492

02:32:48.559 --> 02:32:50.628
ENSURING THAT WE ARE. INVESTING

02:32:50.694 --> 02:32:53.163

LIMITED QUANTITY OF RENEWABLE.

02:33:02.072 --> 02:33:02.940
GAS AND THEY'LL BE REAL QUESTION

02:33:03.007 --> 02:33:04.041
ABOUT WHETHER GOES INTO INDUSTRY
