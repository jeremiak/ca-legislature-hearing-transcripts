PETRIE-NORRIS HERE HER HERE HER CARE RIVAS WE'VE YEARS ARE. WITHOUT A MEMORY WAS WHEN I YOU'RE READY. YOU AFTERNOON. I KNOW BACK WITH A OF YOU WOULD HAVE- I KNOW WHICH SHOULD BE ON. WITH LIKE IT'S ON. THE NUMBER. RIGHT MY TECHNICIAN. YEAH. ACTIONS WITH ALL OF YOU- AND STAKEHOLDERS I HAVE AMENDED AB SEVENTY ONE TO REMOVE REFERENCES TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT REMOVE THE CORPORATE TAX AND MAKE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS- THANKS TO THE ASSISTANCE FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AB SEVENTY ONE ESTABLISHES THE BRING CALIFORNIA HOME ACT AND CREATES FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AN ONGOING SOURCE OF STATE FUNDING FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS. SPECIFICALLY AB SEVENTY ONE COULD GENERATE UP TO ONE BILLION ANNUALLY BY CONFORMING STATE TAX LAWS TO FEDERAL LAW. ADDITIONALLY THIS MEASURE HOLD GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE AND INCORPORATES SIGNIFICANT TRANSPARENCY MEASURES TO ENSURE EVERY DOLLAR IS USED EFFECTIVELY OUR STATE IS FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THAT IS ON ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING A FULL BLOWN CATASTROPHE DUE TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF COVE IN NINETEEN. DESPITE BEING THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD ONE IN FOUR AMERICANS IS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND OR ONE IN FOUR RESIDING CALIFORNIA THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT MEANS THAT OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING CHILDREN. OUR IN HOUSE ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. THOUSANDS MORE ARE ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC. IT'S TIME THAT WE CHANGE OUR APPROACH AND GIVE CALIFORNIA A FIGHTING CHANCE TO REVERSE HOMELESSNESS. THE ONGOING INVESTMENTS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL COULD MEAN TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR THAT ARE ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE APARTMENTS OR RENTAL ASSISTANCE. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN FAMILIES A YEAR WHAT ACCESS SAFE SHELTER WHILE THEY LOOK FOR PERMANENT HOUSING. FORTY THREE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. AND OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE COULD RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SERVICES SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BILL BEING SIGNED INTO LAW. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FUNDING ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WHICH IS WHY I'M ALSO OFFERING AB TWELVE TWENTY WHICH IS REVAMPING OUR CURRENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. I'M HONORED THAT THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BI PARTISAN SUPPORT LAST YEAR AND I'M WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT LEGISLATION THIS YEAR. WITH GOVERNANCE REFORM AND CREATING AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE WE CAN BOTH READ REDUCE BUREAUCRACY OF THE EXISTING PROCESS AND PROVIDE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE. AND ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DESPERATELY NEEDED STRUCTURE AND CONFIDENCE TO IMPLEMENT RESPONSE PLANS AND PROGRAMS THAT COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. TODAY I'M HONORED TO HAVE WITH ME THE AUTHOR OF LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL OR FORMER SENATE COLLEAGUE AND SENATE BUDGET CHAIR AND NOW L. A. COUNTY SUPERVISOR HOLLY MITCHELL. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE COUNCIL MEMBER RIDLEY THOMAS WHO HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE ADVOCATE IN LOS ANGELES AND STATEWIDE AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE ON HOMELESSNESS. UP IT ALSO HERE TO SUPPORT- THE BILL. ADDITIONALLY I HAVE PROFESSOR DARIEN SHANK SEE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF LAW AND HE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MODERATOR WE PLEASE CONNECT US FIRST WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERVISOR HOLLY MITCHELL WELCOME BACK SUPERVISE. CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH ABOUT AND SURE I APPRECIATE IT I HAVE TO TELL YOU I MISS YOU ALL MEMBERS ON TO PROVIDE THE HOLLY MITCHELL PROUDLY REPRESENTED L. A. COUNTY UP. I THINK SECOND DISTRICT AND I'M HERE BEFORE YOU SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTY ONE WHICH IS- COSPONSORED BY THE COUNTY BALLET. I HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL IRONICALLY I AM LITERALLY. VISITING A PROJECT HOME KEEP SITE IN MY DISTRICT AS WE SPEAK. I KNOW THE COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE THAT WE HAVE A GROWING HOMELESS CRISIS AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE ALREADY REACH THE CATASTROPHIC STATE PEOPLE HERE IN L. A. COUNTY. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT BE BELIEVED THAT ONE TIME STATE HOMELESS FUNDING ALLOCATIONS WILL NEVER FULLY ADDRESS A CHRONIC SYSTEMIC PROBLEM YOU IN THE CRISIS. THAT CREATES A SITUATION IN WHICH FAMILIES I TOLD I HAD MET HERE TODAY FIND THEMSELVES IN. L. A. COUNTY A FABRIC. OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH AND STRENGTHEN THAT COUNTY WIDE ALL THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM LARGELY FUELED BY LOCALLY GENERATED REVENUE. I THINK MEASURE H. BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO COUNTY AND OUR PARTNERS HAVE DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS MOVING FROM HOMELESSNESS INTO PERMANENT HOUSING EACH YEAR WE HAVE DOUBLED IT BASED ON. THE COMMITMENT VOTERS NAY IN FUNDING THAT YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS CONTINUES TO OUTPACE THE NUMBER WE CAN- POWDER BEER FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND ADVOCATE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PEOPLE HOW DALY. BUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN NEW PEOPLE FELL INTO HOMELESSNESS DURING THE SAME PERIOD. DO THE HOUSING COSTS IT AND OTHER CRITICAL FACTORS. THEREFORE DESPITE THE PROGRESS L. A. COUNTY MAKE THE DATE WITHOUT THE ON GOING STATE FUNDING COMMITMENTS PROVIDED IN THIS BILL AB SEVENTY ONE L. A. COUNTY IN OTHER COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TURN THIS IMPORTANT TIED AND REDBIRDS. YES GROW IN HOMELESSNESS. NOTE AB SO ONE WOULD ENABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT TO BE A RAY OF EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE VERY NEED SPACE ALL THE FAMILIES BIGELOW DAHLE DALY USED IN THEIR STRUGGLE TO SECURE HOUSING AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF THE CHILD THAT THE CRITICAL FACTOR. AB SEVENTY ONE LAYS OUT A LONG TERM HOLISTIC APPROACH WITH PROVISIONS THAT HOLD LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RECEIVING EIGHTY SEVENTY ONE FUNDED ACCOUNTABLE TO SHOW MEASURABLE STEADY PROGRESS. TOWARD ACHIEVING LONG TERM GOAL. FOR MY FIRST WHAT CRITICALLY BUT THE IS DAD DRIVEN APPROACH. WILL LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO CONFRONT SYSTEMIC RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT REINFORCED DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF HOMELESSNESS AMONG. PEOPLE OF COLOR LARGELY THAT NAKED AFTER THE MERICAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. YOUR EYEBALLS AB SEVENTY ONE.

WE KNOW HOW THAT WORKED AT THE- POINTED COMMITTEE BY THE GOVERNOR DID- PUT FORTH MULTIPLE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT REPORT WE WERE CLEAR WE NEEDED A STATE WIDE STRATEGY AND A COMMITMENT OF ON GOING ANNUAL STATE FUNDING TO COMBAT THIS CRISIS. BOB THIS IS SIMPLY. THE PLANE CRASH NO WAY AROUND IT IF WE WANT TO DO WELL WE NEED TO LEAN IN AND AB SEVENTY ONE IS A DIRECT REFLECTION OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OBJECTION RENTS IN THE LATE WITH THE INVESTMENT OF MEASURE H. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND UNDERGO THE SAFETY NET FOR DECADES HAS SHOWN ITSELF TO BE A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE- BUT I MUST HASTEN TO MAKE THE POINT. THAT MEASURE H. IS SIMPLY INSUFFICIENT AND WEBER AB SEVENTY ONE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A HISTORIC CHANGE NOT BIND AGAIN HOMELESSNESS AND MOVE TOWARDS ESTABLISHING THE RIGHT TO HOUSING FRAMEWORK AND THAT WILL REQUIRE THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SERVICES RELATED TO PREVENTION AND FROM HOUSING PERMANENT HOUSING AND ST ENGAGEMENT.

AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CLINT OLIVIER AND I'M THE CEO OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUSINESS FEDERATION OR BITS THAT FOR SHORT. BILLS THAT IS SUPPOSED TO AB SEVENTY ONE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WELL THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS IS A SERIOUS AND CHRONIC PROBLEM CONFRONTING CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATION IS NOT THE PROPER VEHICLE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. ACCORDING TO A STATE AUDIT REPORT ISSUED IN FEBRUARY CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SPEND HEAVILY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS BUT HAVE NOT FOLLOWED A COORDINATED PLAN AND DON'T BATES SPENDING ON EFFECTIVENESS. THE STATE AUDITOR CONCLUDED THAT CALIFORNIA'S QUOTE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IS DISJOINTED AND QUOTE AND THAT THE STATE QUOTE CONTINUES TO LACK A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF IT SPENDING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS THE SPECIFIC SERVICES BUT PROGRAMS PROVIDE OR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES AND QUOTE. GOVERNOR NEW SINCE JANUARY BUDGET HAS A RECORD RESERVE A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND CALIFORNIA'S ESTIMATED TO HAVE A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE WINDFALL FROM HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED TAX REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE FUNDS FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT WHICH INCLUDES FUNDS EARMARKED FOR HOMELESSNESS IN SHORT TAX INCREASES ARE NOT NECESSARY ESPECIALLY IF CALIFORNIA. BEGINS ITS ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THE STATE HELLO GOVERNMENT SHOULD REFINE THEIR APPROACH TO IDENTIFY ROGRAMS THAT WORK TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS CHRONIC ISSUE INCREASING TAXES IS NOT THE SOLUTION. PRIOR TO THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC MANY BUSINESSES RELOCATED FROM CALIFORNIA TO OTHER LOW COST LOWER TAX STATES. ADDING MORE TAXES DURING THIS PERIOD IS NOT HELPFUL TO CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES IT WILL HINDER THE STATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND AFFECT STATE AND IMPORTANTLY LOCAL TAX REVENUE AS WELL. AS FOR THE WATER'S EDGE ISSUE IT'S NOT A LOOPHOLE AS SOME WOULD ARGUE WHEN IN REALITY IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S TAX STRUCTURE. IT IS A NECESSITY THAT IN LARGE PART CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF DIRECTION FROM THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT D. EASE RISING TENSIONS WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADING PARTNERS WHO OBJECTED TO CALIFORNIA INFRINGING ON THEIR TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH THE UNITED STATES. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NOTEBOOK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE ONE OTHER. THAT'S THE TWO MINUTE TIMER AND I WANT OTHER OPPOSITION LONG. SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY MANUFACTURING ASSOCIATION. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN- I REPRESENT- THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY MANUFACTURING ALLIANCE WHICH- HAS THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY LOCATED IN FRESNO- WE ARE IN OPPOSE ANY OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS- WHAT I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF FRESNO RESCUE MISSION WHICH- IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PROVIDE FOR THE HOMELESS- IN THE FRESNO AREA. AND THIS BILL DOES NOT BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND ADDICTION ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY THE CENTER OF HOMELESSNESS- IT'S CERTAINLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL NONPROFITS THE FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING ALL THE WORK ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW FOR MOST OF IT HERE IN THE FRESNO AREA. AND THAT THIS BILL. DOESN'T SEEM TO SUPPORT THEM IN ANY WAY IN FACT IT PROBABLY REAP PLACES SOME OF THE FUNDING OTHER THING MAY BE CURRENTLY GETTING. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A MASSIVE BUREAUCRACY THAT IS JUST GOING TO EAT UP MORE AND MORE OF THE MONEY- THAT IS ALLOCATED TO IT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING. AND ADDING OR CREATING DATA COLLECTION- WHICH IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. WHERE IN OPPOSITION- FOR THE BILL- THE- TAXATION PORTIONS OF IT HAVE BEEN REMOVED BUT THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER OF OTHER PORTIONS OF THE TAXATION AS I READ IT- IS STILL IN PLACE AND WE WOULD BE IMPOSED TO THAT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WITH MARI PLEASE OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. THANK YOU IN OPPOSITION. FOR TODAY AT AB SEVENTY ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO.

THIS IS KRISTIN CONNELLY ON BEHALF OF THE EAST BAY LEADERSHIP COUNCIL REPRESENTING HUNDREDS OF THE SAME PLAYERS WITH- AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE STYLE. THANK YOU AND MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION LEFT IN Q. GREAT THANK YOU WITH A IS THERE ANYONE IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCING CENTER. NO I ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WELL I'LL START THE SAME DOCTOR BURKE AND WILLS FOR FRIEND- WELL I'M ALWAYS IN FAVOR OF CONFORMITY- SO FIRST- BUT I'M- MAKE A MOTION FOR THE BELL SECOND. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO OF ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS GOT A HUGE TAX BREAK WHICH DID NOTHING TO HELP THE ECONOMY. DID NOTHING EXCEPT FEDERAL MAKE FEDERAL DEBTS LARGER IT'S TIME THAT THEY HELP PAY FOR THE PROBLEMS THE STATE HAS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD I DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR FOCUS AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING WHAT IS ONE OF- THE CRISES FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- COUPLE OF. AREAS THAT I WANTED TO GET INTO A LITTLE BIT SO FIRST CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THE OPPOSITION'S POINT THAT THIS EFFECTIVELY UNDERMINES THE WATER'S EDGE ELECTION. BECAUSE I'M HAVING A HARD TIME CAN WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT SURE I'M GOING TO ASK- I HAVE A- THE WITNESS. PROFESSOR SHEN SKI- THAT COULD SPEAK TO THE TECHNICAL PROVISIONS JANSKY ON THE ASSEMBLY. A LOT OF THE LINE CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU WELCOME THAT DID YOU HEAR THE QUESTION. IT WAS ABOUT THE WATER THAT ELECTION YES YES THE OPPOSITION HAS MADE A POINT THAT THIS EFFECTIVELY UNDERMINES THE WATER'S EDGE ELECTION AND- WOULD BRING US INTO A INTERNATIONAL TRADE WORK IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO. THAT POINT. YES I WOULD. RESPECTFULLY ON DISK DISAGREE WITH THAT- THE WATER THAT ELECTION- DID COME ABOUT- IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BECAUSE THE PRESSURE ON FROM OUR SCREENING PARTNERS AND SO THAT PART. IS TRUE BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND OR BOOK A LOT OF THINGS AND APART UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING FIRST OF ALL. EVEN AT THE TIME OF THE WATERCRESS ELECTIONS WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT. CALIFORNIA I'M CORPORATION TAP THE OPTION TO JUST REPORT ON THERE TO- TO MASTER KERNING SEPARATE FROM THEIR FARM EARNINGS EVEN THAT IS PART OF THE ORIGINAL WATERS AT SELECTION. CALIFORNIA CONFORMS TO FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX LAW AND BROUGHT IN A SLICE OF SUSPICIOUS FOREIGN EARNINGS KNOWN AS SUBPART AT. THOSE ALWAYS THE CASE. THAT CALIFORNIA'S WATER. GRADUAL ACTION INCLUDED. ALEXION ARE INCLUDED INCOME NOMINALLY EARNED ABROAD IN THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. SO ALL THIS BILL DOES IS SAY THAT THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT RECOGNIZED THAT THE OLD REGIME INCLUDING SUB PAR THAT WAS NOT WORKING VERY WELL IN TERMS OF COMBATING INCOME STRIP BEING. CREATED A NEW CATEGORY OF INCOME DEEMED SUSPICIOUS AND LIKELY SHIFTED OUT OF THE DOMESTIC TAX BASE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BRINGS THAT. INCOME BACK INTO THE DOMESTIC TAX BASE I THOUGHT ALL CALIFORNIA WOULD DO WOULD BE CONFORMED AND TO DO THE VERY SAME THING. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA WOULD BE CONFORMING TO WHAT THE FEDS ALREADY KILLING THE NOTION OF THIS IS GONNA SIMPLE OIL CALIFORNIA- IN SOME WAY WITH OUR TRADE PARTNERS IN SOME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING WHAT THE FEDS ARE DOING. IS NOT ACCURATE. FURTHERMORE THE IS CHANGE. ALL WITH INCOMES STRIPPING IS NOW PERCEIVED AS A MAJOR PROBLEM THAT THE OECD COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING- RIGHT NOW SECRETARY ALLEN VERY IS VERY ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH- DEALING WITH- THE PROBLEM OF INCOME SHIFTING INTERNATIONALLY INCLUDING- HAVING INTERNATIONAL TYPE GUILTY REGIMES AND SO THE NOTION THAT OUR TRADING PARTNERS WHAT A JACK IN THE WAY THEY DID IN THE EIGHTIES ITSELF HIGHLY IMPROBABLE. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THAT PROFESSOR CAN CAN OPPOSITION REPLY TO THAT AND TO THE OPPOSITION HERE THAT. DR SHAMS- PROFESSORSHIP SKIS ANALYSIS. WOULD ANYONE OF THE OPPOSITION LIKE TO RESPOND TO DOT- PROFESSOR SJAM SKIS- ANALYSIS ON THE WATER'S EDGE. EXACTLY ONLY BE A FROM HIS BED THANK YOU. GO AHEAD- YOU YOU WE ARE WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE AS I STATED THAT IT IS NOT A LOOPHOLE- AND THAT AS THE IS BEING ARGUED BUT WE THINK IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S TAX STRUCTURE- AND POP OBVIOUSLY WHERE WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO EIGHTY SEVENTY ONE BUT LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THE ISSUE WORKS OUT IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DO HAVE I DO HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION WHICH ACTUALLY I THINK. IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH BECAUSE- CERTAINLY WE HAVE WHICH IS SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE AND CATASTROPHIC CHALLENGE ON OUR HANDS WE LOOK AT OUR OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE LACK OF PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE AS A STATE MIKE MY QUESTION REALLY IS HOW MUCH OF THAT IS. A REVENUE PROBLEM VERSUS HOW MUCH OF THAT IS PERFORMANCE PROBLEM AN EIGHT YEAR I THINK MONDAY OPPOSITION WITNESSES POINTED TO. THE AUDITORS FAIRLY SCATHING AUDIT THAT. A BIG PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT WE JUST HAVE A TOTAL LACK OF COORDINATION AMONGST OUR AGENCIES WE HAVE A LACK IN A NOTE TELLING YOU POINTED OUT. OF DATA DRIVEN ASSESSMENT ABOUT WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT AND- I PRETTY WORRIED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF FIXING SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES FIRST. KIND OF POURING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD SO. AND CAN USE I GUESS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AND- SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO AND I'M GLAD THAT. WE BROUGHT UP THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT IN THIS HEARING. BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO- CALLING FOR MORE COORDINATION LIKE YOU MENTIONED- IT ALSO CALLS ON ADDITIONAL AND DEDICATED FUNDING. TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS THAT SAME REPORT- THAT WAS MENTIONED ALSO CALLS FOR THIS RATE AND- YOU KNOW I HAD A BILL LAST YEAR- I KNOW THAT- YOU'RE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT- THAT WOULD HAVE. BROUGHT ALL OUR PROGRAMS WITHIN THE STATE UNDER ONE OFFICE- AND I'VE BEEN. I'VE CONTINUED WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE GOVERNANCE PIECE THAT IS SOMETHING I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK- AND WE HAVE COME UP WITH A BILL. OF AB TWELVE TWENTY THAT. WORKS ON THE REFORM OF THE HOMELESSNESS GOVERNANCE FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE. BUT IN ADDITION THIS BILL DOES HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. RECAP INCLUDED IN IT- YOU KNOW WE WILL BE COLLECTING DATA. OF THAT THROUGH THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR THIS PROGRAM TO BE AUDITED BY AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR EVERY FOUR YEARS. SO WE WILL BE YOU KNOW THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT I KNOW A LOT OF MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT I AM TOO- IS. IS PART OF THIS PROGRAM. WHAT THINK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M LIKE BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'LL BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I. REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU WERE DOING I HAVE TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY TO IMPROVE OVERSIGHT TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY SO. I DO LOOK FOR TO PARTNERING WITH YOU ON THAT MAP ON THAT ASPECT OF THIS THIS IMPORTANT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS THANKS- AND JUST THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WE HAVE WORKED AND HAVE LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL I'M TAP THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS MOVING FORWARD AS A GOING TO HOUSING. OTHER THOSE ISSUES BE THOROUGHLY ADDRESS THEY WERE DRESSED A LITTLE BIT BUT FRONT THOROUGHLY ADDRESSED MOVING FORWARD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND TO STATE- WELL THANK YOU ALSO TO THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR PASSION- FOR THIS- ISSUE TO STATE THAT- CALIFORNIA HAS A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IS. A HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT. AND SO I GET THAT- I THINK SEEING AGAIN MAKING REFERENCE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. SEEING THE THRTEEN BILLION. HAS BEEN SPENT ON HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. SPEAKS VOLUMES TO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION. IS POURING MORE MONEY INTO THIS THE ANSWER OR IS THERE A BIGGER ISSUE- THAT WE HAVE. AT HAND I THINK THE- THE GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT THIS BILL DOES AND IS WORTHY OF SUPPORT IS THE FACT THAT. YOU'RE LOOKING LONG TERM THIS IS YOUR LOOKING FOR A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE THAT IS GOING TO ADDRESS A CRISIS. IN THE LONG TERM RATHER THAN HAVING DEPEND ON COMING WITH YOUR HAND OUT EVERY SINGLE YEAR LOOKING FOR A ONE TIME ALLOCATION HOWEVER HAVING ALLOCATED THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN A THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND TO STILL SEE THE KIND OF CRISIS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT I HEARD THE URGENCY THAT CAME FROM WITNESSES TESTIMONY THAT WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE ENTERING INTO HOMELESSNESS. ALL RIGHT NOW THEN WE THEN WE ARE TAKING OFF THE STREETS. AND THE AND SO I SEE THAT BUT I ALSO SEE WHERE THERE'S AN OPEN DOOR TO ADDRESS A CHALLENGE OR PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. THAT IS A REVENUE ORIENTED BUT THAT IS SERVICE ORIENTED AND SO WHEN WE START LOOKING AT THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT SERVICES ARE WORKING AND WHAT SERVICES AREN'T. SO WITH THAT I MEAN THE AUDITOR HAD POINTED OUT THAT WE HAVE FORTY HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS WITH LITTLE COORDINATION BETWEEN NINE STATE AGENCIES. AND WITH BILLIONS THAT ARE BEING SPENT. WE HAVE THE ISSUE OF REALLY A SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN SET UP TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. AND IS FAILING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST IN NEED I HEARD THE OTHER SIDE THE OPPOSITION AND THEIR TESTIMONY AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION OF WHY THEY FEEL WHY DO WE NEED MORE MONEY WE'RE NOT EVEN. BENEFITING FROM WHAT WE HAVE AND IT'S BECAUSE THE SYSTEM REALLY ISN'T GETTING THE ANSWER INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE THAT CAN MEET THE NEED. AND SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT- WILL. ONLY MAKE THE WORD BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY HOWEVER. ALONG WITH BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THERE HAS TO BE SOME EVIDENCE. OF MEANINGFUL REFORM. OF AND I APPRECIATE THE BILL THAT YOU PROPOSED LAST YEAR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE ADDITIONAL BILL THAT YOU HAVE THIS YEAR. I'M NOT SEEING THE STRONG REFORM THAT IS NEEDED IN THIS BILL. BUT A TIED I KNOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL AND IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD FROM THIS COMMITTEE- IF THERE HAS TO BE SOME EVIDENCE FROM ADMINISTRATION- TO SUPPORT MEANINGFUL REFORM. SO THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. OF THROWING- MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF RIGHT- OF MANY TAX DOLLARS- INTO A SPACE THAT WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT MEETING THE NEED. SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT ALSO LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF REFORM. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- MEMBERS. HOMELESSNESS IS AN AREA I'VE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH. MY ENTIRE LIFE I WAS RAISED IN A CHURCH THAT CHOSE TO TAKE ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AS THEIR MAIN MISSION- WE ACTUALLY WENT SO FAR AS TO HOUSING PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH AT ONE POINT WHEN THE CITY REFUSED. TO MAKE PROPER ACCOMMODATIONS. AND I'VE SPENT A GOOD BOOK OF THE TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE WORKING ON ALMOST THIS IN MY AREA WHICH WHICH IS GRANTED A RURAL COMMUNITY VERY UNLIKE. YOUR WHOLE. AND THE MORE I DIG IN THE MORE I'VE LEARNED. OVER THE YEARS HE IS JUST SO BONTA CLEAR THAT. THE ISSUES RAISED FROM MY COLLEAGUES HERE. ON ON PROCESS AND BUREAUCRACY AND COLLABORATION- ARE SO VERY TRUE AND FROM. THIS RURAL LEGISLATORS POINT OF VIEW WHAT I SEE AGAIN AND AGAIN IS LEGISLATORS FROM LA. WHO WOULD JUST AS SOON. SPEND AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN AND THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH AND WE ALWAYS NEED TO RAISE MORE AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE WE NEED TO TAX AND YET I GOT UNDERWAY IN SKID ROW JUST GOES ON AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. THANK MORE MONEY WE SPEND THE LONGER THE BLOCKS GET. AND IT SEEMS TO BE FROM AN OUTSIDER'S PERSPECTIVE A REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT URBAN LEGISLATORS ARE SO OFTEN SO DEEPLY INVESTED IN THE SPECIAL INTERESTS WHETHER IT BE THE UNIONS OR THE- NRDC OR THAT WHAT WHATEVER CONSTITUENCY PROGRESSIVE AWAY LEGISLATORS FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T TAKE ON. THEY CAN'T MAKE ANY PROGRESS AGAINST THE NAME DAYS THEY CAN'T BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LESS THAN WHAT IT COST TO BUILD A MANSION WHERE I LIVE- ANY GETS PULLED AND I GUESS WHAT I SEE HERE IN THE MIDST OF. ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IN THE COVERT CRISIS AND SO MANY CHALLENGING ISSUES BUT I KNOW WE'RE ALL FACING AND OR OR COMMUTER FACING. I THINK WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND. WOULD SAY NOW IS THE TIME FOR ANY KIND OF TAX INCREASE ON ANYBODY. RIGHT IT AND WE'RE SPENT THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS I THINK I HEARD. FROM MY COLLEAGUE- AND SO IT'S I GUESS IT'S JUST KIND OF A HEAD SCRATCHING MOMENT FOR ME. I APPLAUD YOU FOR TAKE ON ISSUES I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE IS IMPORTANT. I THINK I VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE WITH YOU ON PERHAPS THE APPROACH AND I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY DOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN. CREATE YOU KNOW STREAMLINING THE PROCESS WHERE REVENUE GOES TO IT GOES TO AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER BETWEEN THE COUNTIES THE COCS- THESE THESE ORGANIZATIONS DON'T WORK TOGETHER WE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF MONEY ON HOMELESSNESS AND WHAT I'VE DONE IN MY HOME TOWN. IS ACTUALLY PULLED EVERY CITY AND THE COUNTY. COLLABORATIVELY POTENTIALLY MAKING THAT MONEY GO AND STRETCH A LOT FURTHER AND SO I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE DAY THIS BILL TODAY UNLESS IN YOUR RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION HERE YOU DO WONDERS AND CONVINCE ME THAT. MY PERSPECTIVE IS SO. INACCURATE- BUT I WOULD HOPE. THAT IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD- IF YOU COULD DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES THE NIMBYISM. YOU KNOW THE- THE NO GROSS- ENVIRONMENTAL EXTREMISM SOME THESE ISSUES THAT EXIST IN THE URBAN AREAS BECAUSE WHAT IT'S DOING IS YOU GUYS AE PUSHING YOUR POPULATIONS OUT AND RURAL COMMUNITIES DRIVING UP THE COST OF HOUSING. YOU DON'T BUILD ROADS YOU FORCE PEOPLE ON THE ROADS LONG COMMUTES WE CAN'T BUILD ROADS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO CLIMATE CHANGE. POLICIES WE CAN'T SOLVE PROBLEMS- AND THEY JUST GET WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE SO IF YOU CAN STICK SOME. LANGUAGE IN HERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE HAPPY TO RECONSIDER BUT FOR TODAY- I BELIEVE I'LL BE LAYING OFF. ALI YOU JUST YOU WON'T DO THAT NOW ARE YOU WANT TO. ADDRESS IT IN YOUR CLOTHES ALL ADDRESSING THE CLOSING BUT I DO HAVE A RESPONSE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KOREA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OKAY I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM OUR LEADER FOR AUTHORING THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR. I'M PROUD TO BE FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND UNDERSTAND THAT US URBAN LEGISLATORS HAVE A LOT TO DEAL WITH WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND I DO HAVE TO SAY. THAT I WAS A CO AUTHOR PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN ON THE BILL THAT REMOVES THE CORPORATE TAX WHICH I BELIEVE MADE THE BILL STRONGER. I'M SADDENED THAT IT'S NO LONGER THERE I WAS SUPPORT OF THEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE NOW OF IT. HOWEVER I DO RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE MUST COME TO THE TABLE READYTO NEGOTIATE AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS- MAKING. INCREDIBLY HARD CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD AND WE CAN ALLOW THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- WHICH IS SO NEEDED TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS I WANT. TO SHOW JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS. AS A CHAIR BUT JUST A- AND SHARE WITH YOU. THAT IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN THE STATE MADE AN INVESTMENT OF FOUR POINT THREE BILLION. FOR PROJECT ROOM KEY. PUNKY IN IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION WITH A B. AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THESE EFFORTS WHICH WE KNOW ARE INCREDIBLY NECESSARY. EARLIER THIS YEAR IN JANUARY I CHAIRED A JOINT BUDGET HEARING WITH THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- REPORT. WHICH WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL AND HAPPY TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU HERE- I'M GOING TO TWEET IT OUT SO THAT FOLKS WHO ARE LISTENING FOR SUPPORTING HER SIMPLY WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT- THIS PARTICULAR ANALYSIS. CAN ALSO HAVE IT IN IF THOSE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE. THE REPORT THE REPORT DISCLOSES OF MANY THINGS THAT WE ALREADY KNOW CALIFORNIA'S BEEN MORE IN HOUSING THAT THE REST OF THE NATION CALIFORNIANS SPEND A LARGER SHARE OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT. THAN HOUSEHOLDS IN THE REST OF THE NATION AT EVERY QUARTER. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FACE THE HIGHEST RISK OF HOUSING INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. AROUND TWO POINT FIVE. MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SPEND MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOMES ON HOUSING. OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION LOW INCOME RENTERS FACE-EVEN MORE DIRE COST PRESSURES SPENDING MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME. ON HOUSING. IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY OVER SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IN L. A. COUNTY ALONE OR EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT'S NEARLY 13% INCREASE FROM TWENTY NINETEEN. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT AS YOU ARE. HAS EXPERIENCED A SIXTY PER 16% INCREASE IN ITS HOMELESSNESS. HOMELESS POPULATION. RISING IT TO ABOUT FORTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS- THERE'S A LOT MORE DATA IN THIS REPORT. EVERY IN TWENTY IN TWENTY NINETEEN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TWENTY POINT TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION IN THE NATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE WAS A 16% INCREASE. BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. POPULATION IS ON SHALL. 65% OF THE POPULATION THAT IS HOMELESS IS MALE 23% OF CALIFORNIA HOMELESSNESS POPULATION IS SEVERELY. MENTALLY ILL. AND NEED RESOURCES IN ADDITION TO WAT'S CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED HOMELESSNESS POPULATION HAS A CHRONIC SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER. 15% OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS POPULATIONS INCLUDES INCLUDES FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. 8% OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS POPULATION AS UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR. BETWEEN EIGHT TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. THE ONLY HOMELESSNESS POPULATION INCREASED BY 13% AND- OVERALL HOMELESSNESS POPULATION IS CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. I CHERYL THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND ACROSS THE STATE. I WANT TO ADDRESS ONE MAJOR ISSUE ON DATA THAT HAS BEEN ASKED- BY. OUR COLLEAGUES. AGAIN IN THE TWENTY TWENTY AND THE EARLY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY HEARING THAT I CHAIRED. SECRETARY LOOT LOW TO THISCUSTOMER TO MEET ITS WITH THE BUSINESS CONSUMER% SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY PRESENTED- SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN MISSING AND THAT WE HAVE ALL BEEN ASKING FOR AND THAT'S THE COLLECTION OF DATA. THE HOMELESSNESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM. ALSO KNOWN AS H. D. I. S. WHEN LIVE THIS PAST WEEK. I WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO ACCESS AND COMPILE STANDARDIZED DATA COLLECTED BY THE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE. WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE DELIVERY. OF HOMELESS SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE THE SYSTEM DID NOT EXIST BEFORE. IT'S BEEN IN THE MAKING FOR A FEW YEARS NOW IT JUST WENT LIVE. ALL OF YOUR OFFICES SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED. AN INVITATION TO REVIEW THE SYSTEM. SO WE CAN START THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE COLLECT DATA. HOW DO WE IMPLEMENT DATA AND HOW DO WE USE THE DATA TO ENSURE. THAT THE FUNDING RESOURCES THAT WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING. ASSISTANCE IF ANY OF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL HELP WITH GETTING THAT I'M HAPPY TO HELP. WITH THAT PROCESS I WILL BE GOING THROUGH THAT TRAINING MYSELF BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE THE SYSTEM. RIGHT THE SYSTEM WITH A DOT LIVES THAT'S NEW NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE THAT'S NOW COME TO LIFE. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SAY OKAY WE'RE PUTTING ALL THESE RESOURCES ARE PASSING IMPORTANT PIECES O LEGISLATION. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND HOW THE HARD EARNED. TAX DOLLARS OF CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ARE GOING INTO PROGRAMS THAT EVENTUALLY AND HOPEFULLY HELP US GT OUT OF THIS CRISIS SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK IN YOUR COMMITMENT ON THIS. I WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR THE PREVIOUS BILL VOTING HAPPY TO BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL NOW. AND WHAT WANT TO BE HELPFUL TO YOU AS A COOPER TO THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD BE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT AND I THINK YOU KNOW SOMEONE RIVAS FOR INTRODUCING THIS LEGISLATION I REMEMBER SPEAKING WITH YOU MONTHS AGO IT FEELS LIKE YEARS AGO ACTUALLY THE THAT IN THE TIME IT'S PAST- WE'RE USE- SHARED WITH ME YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS BILL I YOU'VE DONE IT WITH A LOT OF MEMBERS HAVE TAKEN THAT FEEDBACK- AND BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE ON YOU KNOW WORKING WITH US IN EDUCATING US AND YOU THANKS ME FOR MINE- BUT I JUST REALLY CREDIT YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENCE AND FOLLOW THROUGH AND KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH US ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW WHAT WE CARED ABOUT HOW HE CARED AND HOW WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE BILL- IT'S I WAS IMPRESSED BY IT AND ALSO TOUCHED BY. THE AUTHENTICITY OF- HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE IS NOT JUST ANOTHER BILL SO ANYONE WOULD BE REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AUTHORED A BILL FOR AN ISSUE THAT THEY CARE A LOT ABOUT- AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL SO LET'S JUST GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY. SO I REALLY THOUGHT- BECAUSE AS BROADLY AND AS IS PHILOSOPHICALLY. AS I COULD ABOUT. HOW WE TAX IN IN WHAT WE TAX WHEN HE FIRST PRESENTED THIS TO ME IN THERE BUT A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. ITS CONFORMITY ALWAYS GOOD. IS NOW A RIGHT TIME TO RAISE TAXES. AND THIS IS JUST THE WEIRDEST OF TIMES. AND IT'S A IT'S A REALLY- AWKWARD TIME. IF YOU THINK ABOUT ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES SO WE HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY- EVENT OCCURRING WHERE WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO SHAKE OUT AND AFFECT PEOPLE- YOU KNOW I THINK TWELVE MONTHS AGO WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WE PASSED A BUDGET THAT WE THOUGHT THIS GUY WAS GOING TO FALL- BUT IN FACT. WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT THE VERY WEALTHIEST AND MOST AFFLUENT DID EXTRAORDINARILY WELL- THE ECONOMY DID NOT CRATER EXCEPT IF YOU ARE THE WORKING POOR. THAT THEY THEY WERE THE ONES WHO WERE HURT- THE WORST- AND THE MOST. AND SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT CONFORMITY ON. CORPORATIONS HIDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PROFITABLE CORPORATIONS HIDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVERSEAS. THIS IS THIS IS NOT A CAST OF CHARACTERS THAT I'M FEELING. GUILTY ABOUT RAISING TAXES ON NO PUN INTENDED AND- AND IN IT AND IT STRIKES ME THAT GUILTY WAS A BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE IN WASHINGTON- LED BY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT THAT CHAMPIONED YOU KNOW BIG BUSINESS AND- AND THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO RAISES TAXES SO- I DON'T FIND IT INAPPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA. TO DO THE SAME THING. I THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD MORE REVENUE THAN WE DO RIGHT NOW- AND THAT IS BECAUSE WELL OUR TAX SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS INCREDIBLY FLAWED PARTICULARLY IN TRULY BAD TIMES. THIS TRULY BAD TIME WE TAX THE RIGHT PEOPLE WE TAX THE ONES WHO DID THE BEST WITH THE STOCK MARKET THAT HAS SKYROCKETED- AND CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE DONE VERY WELL CALIFORNIA DOES WELL AND SO WHEN I LOOKED AT WHAT WOULD WE DO IF WE RAISED THE GUILTY TAX. THAT DIED THAT WHAT COULD WE DO FOR CALIFORNIANS IN ONE PLACE WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID RAISE TAXES WAS ON- THE DEDUCTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND WOULD IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO RAISE TAXES. ON ON THE CORPORATIONS THAT DID THE BEST AND THEN OFFSET THOSE WHO HAD OF A BIRD HIGHER BURDEN PLACED ON THEM- BUT YOU FOUND A MORE IMPORTANT THING TO SPEND THAT MONEY ON. SO YOU HOMELESSNESS IS A HIGHER ORDER NEED. AND THAT'S NOT SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT SPENDING MONEY ON THAT BUT IF WE DIDN'T SPEND MONEY ON THAT WHAT WITH THE MASS BE. IN OUR STATE. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL CALIFORNIANS THEY'RE NOT. ANGELENOS STATE THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE STICKS SIR SKID ROW OR THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR THE COAST FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WE NEED TO CARE ABOUT EVERYONE. IS THERE'S NO TRIBALISM HERE. AND IF THERE IS IT'S WRONG. THE AND SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT. WHAT'S THE TIPPING POINT IN CALIFORNIA IS IT HIGHER TAXES DID WE RAISE THEM TOO HIGH. OR IS THE QUALITY OF LIFE SO BAD THAT WE ARE FREE TO STEP OUTSIDE OUR DOOR. THAT'S THE TIPPING POINT. CORPORATIONS AREN'T FLEEING CALIFORNIA THERE IS NO MASS EXODUS. IS THE WORKING POOR WHO ARE TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT. AS THE MAYBE THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT'S SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT. MAYBE WE'RE NOT CARING FOR PEOPLE ENOUGH IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS IN A PLACE THAT I WANT TO RAISE MY FAMILY. ANY LONGER. OR CAN'T FIND HOUSING THAT'S AFFORDABLE. AND SO WHEN WE FREE OUR- OUR ITIES OR SMALL TOWNS BECAUSE THERE ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN GREAT NEED. THAT THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH. EVEN WHILE THE WEALTHIEST HAVE NEVER BEEN RICHER. EVEN ALL THE CORPORATIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL. THAT THERE ARE STILL MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE HURTING. VISIBLY NOT JUST IN HIDING. BUT ACTUALLY IN HIDING BUT THAT YOU CAN'T SEE. THAT THAT WE KNOW THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN SOCIETY SO WE NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE BEST INVESTMENTS THAT IS HAPPENING CONTINUALLY. I AM NOT I'M PROUD TO SAY YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AT LEAST IN MY HOME COUNTY ARE HOMELESS RATES WENT DOWN. ON AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE WILL BE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OUR HEAD COUNTS YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT BEEN THE SAME SINCE THE PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM IS. EXTRAORDINARILY SEVERE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN I WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT THIS HOUSING ALSO IN THE BUSINESS GROUPS THAT HAVE WEIGHED IN AGAINST THIS. THEY'RE REALLY PROUD TO STAND UP FOR THEIR MEMBERS. WHO AGAIN ARE ARE MAKING A PROFIT. PROBABLY NEVER BEEN AS GOOD FOR THEM AS A IT AS IT EVER HAS BEEN- AS IT IS TODAY. AND IF YOU IF THEY SAY THEY REALLY DO CARE ABOUT HOUSING BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL FOR ALL THE HOUSING BILLS. WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS PAYING FOR IT. THEY'RE ALL FOR THE HOUSING BILLS WHEN THERE'S A BOND ON THE BALLOT WE'RE PAYING BACK THAT BOND IS THE CROWD OUT. SOCIAL SERVICE SPENDING COULD YOU KNOW WE GOT TO PAY INTEREST SOMEONE THAT WE GOTTA PAY PRINCE WILL BACK ON THOSE BONDS. THEY'RE ALL FOR IT WHEN IT COMES OUT HOUSE OUT OTHER SPENDING. IN THE BUDGET. THEY'RE NOT FOR IT WHEN THEY'RE MEMBERS WHO PAY THEIR SALARIES. DON'T WANT. TO BUT THERE MEMBERS ARE DOING REALLY WELL SO IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT IT WHEN YOU'RE ASKED TO CHIP IN. YOU SHOULDN'T ONLY TO SAY YOU SUPPORT. MORE BONDS THAT ARE GONNA SQUEEZE OUT THE SPENDING THAT ARE CAN ALSO PROVIDE THE SOLUTIONS SO I LOOK FOR TO VOTING AYE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE HAVE DOCTOR CORD AND THEN THE VICE CHAIR. YES I'LL JUST- DISAGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR MERCED- LOOK THIS REALLY ISN'T A TAX INCREASE THIS ISN'T. THIS IS TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID. WHICH IS TO TAKE MONIES THAT SHOULDN'T BE HIDDEN ABROAD AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE. ALLOCATED WHERE THEY WORK WHICH IS IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S ONE POINT THE OTHER POINT IS IT REALLY DOES COST. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MAKE UP FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT HASN'T BEEN BUILT. AND FURTHER SINCE A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ON THE STREET FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THEY NEED SOCIAL SERVICES SUPPORT IT'D JUST GET USED TO PAYING RENT TEN. YOU KNOW HOW HAVING A HOME IN TREATING IT WELL. THIS WAS NOT DONE. IN THE HOUSING PROGRAMS THAT WE SAW IN THE FORTIES FIFTIES AND SIXTIES. AND THOSE PLACES BECAME UNACCEPTABLE- SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED BOTH THE HOUSING AND THE SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE IF WE DO THIS WE CAN MAKE A REAL CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT ISN'T CHEAP AND FRANKLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SPEND. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN CERTAINLY THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WAS BUILT IN THE FORTIES FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES HOWEVER. AT LEAST WE WERE BUILDING AT AND FRANKLY THERE WAS LITTLE TO NO. HOMELESSNESS AND CERTAINLY EVERYONE COULD HAVE A HOME OVER THEIR HEADS. WHEN REAGAN CAME IN THE FIRST THING THAT WAS CUT TO PAY FOR HIS TAXES WAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS NEVER REAL POPULAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUT IT NEAR SOMEBODY. SO ANYWAY WE STOP PAIN WE PROBABLY SHOULD IF WE'D CONTINUED WITH THE PROGRAMS WE HAD WE PROBABLY WANT TO SPEND A TRILLION DOLLARS BY NOW. OF WHICH A HUNDRED BILLION WOULD HAVE GONE TO CALIFORNIA AND THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T HAVE HOMELESSNESS. SO THIS IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR YOU TO PROBLEM. BUT IT'LL HOPEFULLY GET US THERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE REFORMS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FIRST I WANT TO APPLAUD YOUR EFFORT. WE ALL ON HERE KNOWS THERE'S A HOMELESS PROBLEM WALK OUT THIS CAPITAL YOU SEE IT WALK OUT MY DOOR MY HOME YOU SEE IT WHAT TO MY GROCERY STORE YOU'LL SEE IT DRIVE DOWN THE STREET TO MY CHILDREN'S SCHOOL YOU SEE IT. THERE'S NO WHERE THE G. CANNOT SEE AND WE DON'T WE ALL AGREED THERE'S A PROBLEM. BUT HERE'S MY CONCERN. WHAT THE PANDEMIC YOUR LOVE WE'RE THERE'S AN ESTIMATE ABOUT 40% OF BUSINESSES SHUTTING DOWN IN CALIFORNIA. WHETHER WE WON OR ARE YOU A WE ARE PRO BUSINESS AGAINST MRS I DON'T CARE. AT THE END OF DAY BUSINESS COMES WITH JOBS. JOBS ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY AND TO BE ABLE TO. GET IT BECAUSE I GET INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND DO A LITTLE BETTER. LOOK I GREW UP POOR I WAS ON WELFARE AND FOOD STAMPS. MY FAMILY WE DIDN'T SPEAK ANY ENGLISH WHEN WE CAME HERE FROM THAILAND AS A REFUGEE. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE TO WORK AT TEN YEARS OLD TO CLEAN HOUSES JUST TO GET MONEY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CLOTHES. OR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR MY PARENTS HAVE TO FIGHT AND ARGUE WHETHER WE'RE GETTING SOME GAS FOR THEM TO GO WORK. FOR A GALLON OF MILK FOR US FOR THE WEEK. I'VE BEEN THERE I KNOW IT. BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN THOUGH IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO SHUT DOWN AND PEOPLE BLAMING THE SO CALLED CORPORATION. THAT'S SO COOPER CORPORATION. THE ONE THAT IS PAYING FORTY PERCENT. THEIR INCOME THAT'S COMING IN SO THE IDEA TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T PAY. THEIR FAIR SHARE. WE CAN ALWAYS ASK FOR MORE BUT PLEASE DON'T SAY THEY DON'T PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND SECOND IF WE KEEP ON SHUTTING THESE BUSINESSES. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA THE HIGH PAYING JOBS. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER JOBS. NOT THE TOURISM JOB WHICH IS GREAT JOBS BUT THEY'RE NOT HIGH PAYING JOBS FOR FAMILY TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WE HAVE SPENT IN CALIFORNIA THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. I'M SORRY IT HAS NOT HELPED AT ALL. SOMEBODY PLEASE PROVIDE ME WITH INFORMATION HOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO SUPPORT. TO HELP EASE. THE SITUATION. BUT MY CONSTITUENTS ARE TELLING ME WELL WHAT DID YOU DO WITH YOUR MONEY WHERE DID IT GO. IT'S WORSE THAN IT I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S WASN'T A PANDEMIC IT'S STILL IT'S IT ACTUALLY WAS IN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IT WAS REALLY BAD ALREADY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. OF COURSE IT'S GOTTEN WORSE. BUT IT'S NOT HELPING WHERE DID ALL THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAS GONE AND IS IT JUST. ONE WATER INTO A GLASS IT'S READY FULL OF PROBLEMS JUST THROWING MONEY AWAY IS NOT GOING TO WORK AND SO I DID I MEAN. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T HAVE ANYMORE BUSINESSES LEAVING THE STATE AND WE CAN THAT WE I KNOW THAT WE ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT. ARGUMENTS WHY THEY'RE LEAVING. BUT WE ARE JUST THEY'RE LEAVING WHETHER WE WANT TO ARGUE WHY THEY'RE LEAVING OR NOT THEY'RE LEAVING. AND THOSE ARE ALL THE MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT PACE REALLY REALLY WELL. AND YET WE HAVE SUCH A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY WITH PULLING IN MORE MONEY. AND LIKE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID- FROM THE RULE ERA IS THAT. WE NEED COLLABORATION I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE COUNCIL HAVEN'T BEEN A COUNTY SUPERVISOR HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE SENATE AND NOW IN THE ASSEMBLY. THERE'S NO THIS COLLABORATION DOESN'T EXIST WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESS SUCH SOLUTIONS. IT ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT WE APPEAR HAVE OWN IDEA ON BOTH SIDES I- HAS THEIR OWN IDEA FROM THE RURAL VERSUS URBAN HAS DIFFERENT IDEAS. IN MY COUNTY- CENTRAL WEST ORANGE COUNTY HAS A VERY DIFFERENT IDEA THAN SELF ORANGE COUNTY. THAT'S JUST REALITY SO ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL. AND MORE MORE MONEY IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. ONE OF THE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MEMBER MENTIONED BY THE HOME SHE TOLD THEM. IT'S A GREAT IDEA GREAT PROGRAM. MY UNDERSTAND IS AN ORANGE COUNTY. ONLY ONE CITY APPLY FOR. BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND HOTELS OR MOTELS TO BE ABLE TO CONVERT IT. YEAH I MEAN THE GREAT IDEAS BUT ORANGE COUNTY MY UNDERSTAND HAS ONLY ONE CITY. AS OF I THINK LAST YEAR THAT ACTUALLY APPLY FOR. IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT IT IT'S THAT IT DOESN'T WORK IN ORANGE COUNTY. SO YOU CAN THROW MORE MONEY AT US OR ANYONE ELSE IN THE STATE. I DON'T SEE IT CHANGING AND IT'S NOT HELPING AND SO. I APPLAUD THE EFFORT AND I'M NOT YOU KNOW. NOT SAY THAT I'M NOT HERE TO HELP HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM. I GO OUT EVERY YEAR FOR YOU KNOW HOW DECADE. DOING THE COUNT. IN THE EVENING- WE DONE LOTS OF TASK FORCE WHEN I WAS ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND IT JUST IT. IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS. AND WE PULL MORE MONEY THAN WE'VE HAD. A DECADE AGO AND IT'S NOT GOING AWAY IT'S GOTTEN WORSE WE CAN'T EVEN STEP OUT OF OUR HOUSE OR STEP DOWN THE STREET OR EVEN. YOU KNOW IN THE PARK AREA AND NOT BE AFRAID FOR CHILDREN- AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS AND- AND HOW DO WE JUSTIFY TO OUR CONSTITUENT WHEN. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE STATE'S CAN HAVE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SURPLUS. WHEN IS. WHEN IS IT TIME TO LOOK BACK AND HELP THE TAXPAYER THE BUSINESSES WHO ARE CREATING THESE HIGH PAYING JOBS. SO I AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS I WILL BE OPPOSING THE THEM TODAY. FINGERPRINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE HOMELESS AND A POTENTIAL SOLUTION. HOWEVER AYE SIR SURE A LOT OF THE SAME CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO JUST SPOKE SHARES OF FIRST OF ALL WITH IN REGARDS TO HOMELESS WE HAVE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS CHASING AFTER DISSOLUTION. AND WE HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET I WOULD LIKE US TO FIND THE SOLUTION AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS BECAUSE THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT FACETS OF HOMELESS AND YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH PUT IN FIVE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. AND SOME OF THEM WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL TO TAKE CARE OF IT- THE MENTALLY ILL THE DRUG ABUSE AND THOSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY. AND UNTIL WE DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO DO ABOUT THAT. WE CAN THROW ALL THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT ALL OF THE YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS AGENCIES THAT THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO STEP UP AND HELP THESE FOLKS. THEY WANT BUT IF. WE HAVE IF WE DON'T IF WE DON'T SOLVE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BY GIVING THEM HOUSES OR OR TRYING TO PAY RENT FOR THEM- THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE OUT THERE. THE HOMELESS ISSUE IN OUR REGION HAS GOTTEN WORSE. AND AND IT'S NOT AS VISIBLE- YOU KNOW PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS GETTING BETTER BUT NOW THEY JUST LEARNED HOW TO HIDE BETTER. AND SO THAT YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T SEE THAT AS BEING A GOOD REASON TO RAISE TAXES ON SOMEBODY TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE IT BETTER OR NOT- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A DIFFERENT. A DIFFERENT APPROACH WITH THE WITH THE COSTS FOR HOMELESS IS. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THIS IS HOW MUCH IT WILL COST AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO FIND THE MONEY TO DO IT. ARE IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE RAISING OF AGAIN- IT GOING AFTER THOSE CORPORATIONS. BECAUSE THERE IS THERE IS SOME LOSS THERE IS SOME BLEEDING IN CALIFORNIA OF SOME PRETTY BIG CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE LEFT BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION THERE THE BIGGER ISSUE IS WE ALSO WANT CORPORATIONS TO COME HERE IT'S HARD TO LEAVE IT REALLY IS IT'S HARD FOR BUSINESSES SET UP AND BE HERE FOR FIFTY YEARS AND THEN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE PACKING UP WE'RE LEAVING. BUT IT'S NOT REALLY HARD FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE CONSIDERING WHERE THEY WANT TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS WHERE THEY WANT TO EMPLOY PEOPLE. TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PLACE IS OFF LIMITS WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT. AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF BUSINESSES. IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORLD IN A LOT OF THE CITIES AROUND. THAT'S A WERE COMING ACROSS PEOPLE WHO SAY WE ABSOLUTELY ARE NOT GOING TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I FEEL LIKE IS CAUSING THAT ENVIRONMENT. SO SO EASY YEAH I'M I'M I NEED TO OPPOSE THIS- BECAUSE I- YEAH I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND I LOVED IT. I HOPE SOMEDAY WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT. WE HAVEN'T DONE IT IN THE TEN YEARS OR THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS STUFF- BUT- I CAN'T KEEP CHASING BUSINESSES OUT HERE. THOSE JOBS ARE CRUCIAL TO SOLVING PART OF THAT HOMELESS ISSUE. ENOUGH AND THAT'S THE PART. WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK. AND WHO CAN BE EMPLOYED AND NOW CAN AFFORD TO MAKE A HOUSE. PAYMENT CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT. RIGHT NOW THEY CAN'T AND IF WE DON'T GET MORE JOBS HERE FOR THEM THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT WILL NEVER SOLVE THAT PROBLEM EITHER. SO THAT'S WHERE I'M KIND OF COMING FROM MONEY I APPRECIATE. YOUR EFFORTS. AND LOOK FORWARD TO HELPING BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. I THINK I'M LAST. FIRST I WANT TO THINK THE AUTHOR I KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO HEAR A LOT HERE AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE MAIS MYSELF OUR OUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND- AND YOU AND YOUR COALITION OF I THINK ABOUT EIGHTEEN GROUPS- HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS I THINK THAT WE DID OUR BEST TO PREPARE YOU FOR WHAT WAS PROBABLY GOING TO BE SAID TODAY AND SOME OF THE POSITIVES AND CONCERNS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPRESSED TODAY. I REALIZE OUR GUEST ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO WAS FINE WITH THE WAY THE BILL WAS BEFORE BUT I THINK THAT YOU SEE WHY WE HAVE THE AMENDMENTS WE DID FOR CLARIFYING PURPOSES- I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SAID IT BUT SOMEONE SAID THAT THE CORPORATE TAX ACCOUNTS 440% IT'S 10% OF OUR BUDGET BUT- JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE DEALING WITH ACTUAL FACTS HERE- SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LOT AND YOU HAVE BEEN VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT COLLABORATION AND THAT THERE'S NO CENTRAL HUB AND I KNOW YOU HAVE WORKED SO HARD ON THAT. IN THE PAST AND THAT IS NOT THIS BILL SO I WANT TO CLARIFY A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE SECOND TIER TODAY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS ACTUAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND IS IN FRONT OF US- THAT BEING SAID OBVIOUSLY I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS- THAT MANY HAVE EXPRESSED IN THAT IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THERE'S MEANS TEST FOR ALL THESE PROGRAMS THAT DO GET THESE FUNDS- BUT WITH THAT I THINK THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH A REALLY BALANCED OPTION- TWO SEATS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THEIR BEST AND WHO ARE TO HAVE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS RIGHT. NOW FOR GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. YES LIVING IN URBAN. IS VERY DIFFICULT AS A MEMBER FROM URBAN COMMUNITY I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS- WE HAVE STRUGGLED. WE HAVE STRUGGLE TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM AND NO MONEY IS NOT GOING TO BE THE ONLY THING TO FIX IT. BUT I THINK THIS IS ONE SMALL STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF MAKING THINGS A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR THOSE YOUNG KIDS THAT LIVE ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW WHO DON'T GET A SECOND CHANCE OF BEING AND KIDS. WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR INTO YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME. AND TO. THE DIVERSE COALITION THAT IS BEHIND THIS BILL- FROM ALL PARTS OF THE STATE- YOU KNOW. THIS DISCUSSION HAS. BEEN GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE- ALL OF YOU SPOKE. EVERY MEMBER. OF THIS COMMITTEE. REQUESTED TO SPEAK AND TO COMMENT BECAUSE- ONE THING IS WE- ALL. CARE ABOUT SOLVING THIS CRISIS- ALL OF YOU. I COULD HEAR IT. IN YOUR COMMENTS HOW PASSIONATE. YOU ARE. ABOUT GETTING TO A SOLUTION- AND WHETHER YOU'RE FROM. A RURAL AREA. URBAN AREA. SUBURBAN AREA THE INLAND EMPIRE. THE BAY AREA. WE ALL CARE IT'S- A PROBLEM. THAT HAS UNFORTUNATELY. DEVASTATED ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. AND WHILE I AM PROUD. TO BE AN LA LEGISLATOR. RIGHT I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT JUST AN ALLEY PROBLEM. AND WHEN I. DEVELOP THIS BILL AND LISTEN TO ALL OF YOU FOR FEEDBACK AND MADE THE AMENDMENTS. BASED ON YOUR REQUESTS. IT WAS BECAUSE IT HAS TO WORK FOR ALL OF US ACROSS THE STATE. RIGHT AND ONE THING. THAT HAS BEEN MISSING. IN HOMELESSNESS IS AN ON GOING FUNDING SOURCE. THAT DOESN'T RELY. ON THE FISCAL HEALTH OF THE GENERAL FUND. RIGHT BECAUSE WHILE WE'RE DOING WELL THIS YEAR AND SEVERAL OF YOU MENTIONED AND I AGREE. ON THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE SERVED MUCH LONGER THAN I HAVE. IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO. IS TO COME. TO A FEDERAL TAX. THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED. DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. A REPUBLICAN. PRESIDENT CAME UP WITH THIS TAX I DON'T INVENTED ARE COLD CHINDIT. WE ARE CONFORMING JUST LIKE WE DID IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN WE MOST OF US VOTED FOR AB NINETY ONE LED BY OUR CHAIR- THAT CONFORMS. IN ORDER TO FIND THE KELLY I. T. C. FOR OUR NEEDY FAMILIES THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY. AND I THINK WHILE- I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM ON THIS REVENUE SOURCE- I THINK THE BEST THING IS THAT IT DOES NOT RELY ON THE GENERAL FUND. TO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- AND ALSO IT ONLY AFFECTS A SMALL NUMBER OF LARGE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO AVOID TAXES BY SHIFTING PROFITS OVERSEAS. IT'S VERY TARGETED RATE I'M LIKE I SAID I DID NOT INVENT THIS OF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS PASSED UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND NOW THIS IS A CHANCE TO CATCH UP FOR CALIFORNIA TO COME FORWARD TO IT. AND USE THAT REVENUE. FOR TO TARGET HOMELESSNESS AND I KNOW A LOT OF US MENTIONED THAT WE'VE SPENT X. AMOUNT OF MONEY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON HOMELESSNESS AND IT HASN'T WORKED. BUT I HAVE VISITED. PLACES WHERE IT HAS WORKED WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING HOUSE AND WE DON'T SEE THEM BECAUSE NOW THEIR HOUSE. THEY'RE GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED RIGHT I'M FORTY THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO GROW AND IT IS STILL VISIBLE. RIGHT BUT THAT MONEY HAS BEEN USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO HOUSE PEOPLE TO HELP CHILDRENAND FAMILIES THAT DID NOT HAVE A STABLE HOME IN OUR STATE. WHERE CORPORATIONS CONTINUE TO THRIVE AND I SUPPORT THAT I SUPPORT GOOD JOBS I HAVE SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE- FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS AND I HAVE SUPPORTED TAX CREDITS THAT BRING JOBS TO ALL OF OUR CMMUNITIES. RIGHT BUT THIS TAX THIS SPECIFIC TAX. OF IT JUST TARGETS A SMALL NUMBER IT DOES NOT TARGET SMALL BUSINESSES- IF YOU DON'T HAVE FOREIGN ASSETS. THAT CORP THOSE CORPORATIONS ARE NOT AFFECTED RIGHT IT'S VERY TARGETED AND I THINK. OF WE LIKE I SAID WE LL SHARE THE PASSION FOR HOMELESSNESS SO DO ALL OF CALIFORNIANS YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE POLLS AT THE TOP WHEN YOU PULL OR VOTERS THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT US TO DO. WHEN WE COME EVERY WEEK TO SACRAMENTO. AND WHAT I HEARD TODAY. FROM ALL OF YOU AND ALL OF YOU SPOKE I'VE NEVER PRESENTED TO COMMITTEE WORK EVERY MEMBER HOW TO COMMENT. ON ONE OF MY BILLS OF AND SO I'M VERY HONORED THAT YOU DID BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT WE ALL WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU I EVEN THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTING. YOU KNOW I'M HEARING YOU I'M HEARING YOUR PASSION TO WANT TO WORK AND I WELCOME YOU TO BE PART OF THIS COALITION. THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE IT ALL. BUT LIKE I SAID THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSALS. OUT THERE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS SUPPORTING THAT OTHER MEMBERS HAVE SUPPORTED AND I ENCOURAGE ALL OF US. TO JOIN THEM AND TO GIVE THEM THAT FEEDBACK BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE DON'T DO THAT WE'RE ALL BUSY. BUT WE ALL WANT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO WORK WITH THIS COALITION BECAUSE THEY HAD A SOLUTION. AND I THINK. THIS IS PART OF THE SOLUTION. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WE HAD A MOTION AND A SECOND MISTER MOON WHICH CULTURAL. BURKE HI BURKE OKAY WHEN. WINDOW THREE. GRANO GRAYSON GRAYSON I LEVINE LEVINE I CARILLO RELY MULLIN LONG ISLAND ICED TEA TREE NORRIS. OKAY OF PETRIE-NORRIS NOT VOTING.

THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MULTI TASKING HERE TODAY. ALL RIGHT I DON'T SEE SANTIAGO AND ARTWORK WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOU CAN DO IT FROM THERE IF YOU'D LIKE. MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO STATED IN THE ANALYSIS PAGE THREE ITEMS B. C. D. BELIEVE THAT TAKES CARE OF- EVERYTHING THAT WAS ASKED FOR- IF WE GET THE POINT HERE IS WE'RE TRYING TO GET. RESEARCH DONE FOR WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO WHICH IS UNDERSTANDING IF THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY REALLY WORK. AND FOR THAT WERE REQUIRED TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL SORTS OF DATA INCLUDING THE TAX DATA. IN THIS CASE- TAKE IT WE'VE TECH WE HAVE TAKEN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO ASSURE THAT THIS TAX DATA DOES NOT. CONTAIN PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT EVEN IF THEY GOT IT BY ACCIDENT THEY CAN'T GIVE IT OUT. AND IN ADDITION IT'S ONLY STATE TAX RECORDS NOT FEDERAL SO IT'S GOT THAT IS ADDED INTO DATA FROM MANY OTHER SOURCES- IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE TAX BOARD TO GIVE THE- THE INFORMATION OUT IT SIMPLY ALLOWS THEM TO DO IT ALLOWS THEM TO CHARGE- ANY. NECESSARY COSTS SO THAT'S- THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE BUT THE BIG THING IS WE NEED TO KNOW IF PRESIDENT PROGRAMS ARE WORKING. AND I HAVE TODAY- JAMIE AUSTIN FROM THE TIPPING POINT COMMUNITY WHO WILL SPEAK TO THIS. OKAY WE HAVE A MODERATOR WE HAVE A G. ME AUSTIN OF TIPPING POINT COMMUNITY ON THE LINE WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WITHOUT WORK. GOOD GAP A BIGGER DICK. OCULAR MEMBERS- JAMIE OFTEN THE POINT COMMUNITY I THINK YOU THOUSAND FIVE WE'VE INVESTED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND SOLUTION TO FIGHT POVERTY IN THE BAY AREA AND THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE WORKED TO INCREASE THE UPTAKE OF CALIFORNIA'S EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN THIRTY EIGHT. ARE CURRENTLY RESEARCHERS CAN USE DATA FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ONLY TO SAY TOPICS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENT MISSION BUT WE THINK WE CAN LEARN A LOT MORE FROM THE DATA AFTER THIS BILL AGENCIES AND RETAIN DISCRETION ABOUT WHICH PROJECTS TO APPROVED. AND IN FACT THE BILL WOULD GIVE AGENCIES MORE DISCRETION TO ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO EXPLORE A RANGE OF POVERTY RELATED STUDIES AB SO WE MIGHT LEARN THINGS LIKE THE IMPACT OF OUR TAX CREDIT ON VARIOUS- HEALTH OUTCOMES WE COULD GAUGE THE IMPACT OF JOB LOSS ON FAMILY PROPERTY AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING. WE CAN EXAMINE PARTICIPATION IN THE STATE PAGE NOT PROGRAM TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE FOR ONE SERVICE ARE ACCESSING OTHER IMPORTANT SERVICES. AND WE THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS AND POLICYMAKERS AND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE TIPPING POINT AND THEY ARE GOOD USE OF THE STATE DATA OUT A COUPLE THINGS TO POINT OUT OF THE BILL DOES NOT JUST GIVE ACTED TO ANYONE OUT THAT WAS MENTIONED ON THE LANGUAGE IN THE BLL MIRRORS THAT USED AND OTHER SIMILAR SECTION FOUND IN THE PENAL CODE. THAT PROVIDES ACCESS ONLY TO BONAFIDE RESEARCH BODIES- AND THAT LANGUAGE HAS WORKED WELL FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR YEARS SECONDLY RESEARCH BODY MUST BEAR THE COST OF ANY DATA REQUEST THEMSELVES SO THE BILL DOES NOT INCREASE THE STATE COST- THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE IN EVERY JOB YEAH ABOUT.
