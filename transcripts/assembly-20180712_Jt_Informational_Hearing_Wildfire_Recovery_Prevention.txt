test one test tube there's three good afternoon so there's always a lesson the lesson is hisses. Places been beautifully set up for us but they forgot new batteries. And I think that's a good reminder make sure you have batteries make sure you a fresh water -- In a whole lot of other things -- Just to it for life in general but certainly. Here in our community where -- We have experienced just some extraordinary -- Challenges and disasters over the last six months and so I want to thank. All of you and welcome all of you here today as well as those who are joining us. Via live stream -- And I do believe there is so large -- Representation out there in the ether who are. A concern that are participating and I want to thank all of you who are here today. Offer joining up. I'm state senator Hannah Beth Jackson I represent the nineteenth state Senate district. Which is all of Santa Barbara county and all of western Ventura county -- Through -- High Santa Paula and Fillmore and all the way up. Kim Rio to the top of the Kaneko grade and up in this direction so. The districts are only about a hundred and every amber that fire. Other Tom aspirant every incident we've had in this area is in not only the nineteen Senate district but the thirty seventh the simply districts so. My culture assembly member Monique cling we moan and I are joined at the hip. Literally and figuratively up and I was thinking the other day Our first bonding moment came during the time we're having those terrible range -- And we both needed to be here so we rented a truck. And drove down from Sacramento think it took nine and a half hours. And we wish we were. Stupid to do this C. it was a very dangerous trip but we needed to get home and and of course we've been -- Side by side during the Thomas fire and we're so we're going to brief when. C. are -- Holiday fire so -- It's it's an honor for me to be able to share the stage with her. And Dodd to be your your state senator I know we've all been through a lot [inaudible] And hopefully we are moving out of it but the the fire that we had last week in his reminder that we must always be vigilant. That -- We are. Only. Get a bit a lot away from having events that are again going to challenge our our community but we have a spirit here. Are members -- Being here about six months ago people who had just been through the debris flow -- And seeing us come together really is inspiring -- And we have and we will continue to do so as we all have our hearing today -- We've entitled a vision for Santa Barbara recovery and rebuild evaluating where we are now. The long term plan for revitalizing our community. And ensuring continued effective collaboration going forward for whatever the challenges are in the disasters that may befall us. Being strong togethers community working with our public officials in our community -- We will continue to overcome and the strength and a by the lessons that we learned. So the purpose of today's hearing is to assemble key leaders from both the local and state level. A to update this community on the efforts that are being taken in both Sacramento. And of Santa Barbara for the long term rebuilding and revitalization of the county. Of Monning and of I think that. By the fact we're here. We had an incident last Friday our discussions about. Doing something that seemed appropriate after six months who made even more important -- By this fired this past weekend which sadly took thirteen homes and a number of additional buildings. But with a without the loss of life and that of course is always the critical and most important thing. And the fact that we up that are. Public safety or fire department Skinner with lessons learned they knew it with a red flag warning that there was a real potential for fire and there's no doubt. That having these fire trucks from other parts of the state or local folks everybody all hands on deck. Kept that far from getting worse than than it was in and then it could have been so. With nine far out thousand wildfires ignited across all parts of the strip state last year which was no worse fire -- Wildfire year we've had this year looks like it's going to be as bad if not worse -- We burned over -- Half a million acres of land last year destroyed more than ten thousand eight hundred structures. And claimed the lives of seventy one people -- And we of course here in in this county were among the most impacted their communities in the state first with the Thomas fire which also. Impacted our friends and colleagues in Ventura -- Took out about five hundred eighty six homes in. One strip of fought area in Ventura took out homes in the Ohio valley -- And then of course -- Damaged -- About a thousand homes when we the debris flow -- We've had our share of problems so -- We're here today to talk about -- Where we are in terms of that rebuilt our resiliency what we're gonna do going forward the county has been gracious enough to give? It's their time to be here in the state we also have. A a number of people representing the state of who are with us. You know the frequency of these natural disasters reflects would get a brown and others have been talking about is the new normal. Climate change is real. And does the fact that we have gone through years of drought that our weather fans have been so much more dramatic whether it's here in California through or around the country or world. A we have we saw when we had that debris flow the humidity -- During the fire rather in and as said to be flow was -- Creating a the lowest humidity rates that's why the fire burned as it did it when it started it was burning at the rate of an acre [inaudible] Second. Think about that acre a set. And the night of the debris flow because we have pre positioned So many of our public safety people nine hundred people. Out were saved the night of the debris flow. So we lost. Twenty three there were nine hundred other people who are sick because of the work that was done in anticipation. Of this potential problem we have to maintain that vigilance and I am confident that. With your help with the help of the experts who are here and good government and that really is this is government at its finest people coming together. Recognizing the challenges that we have and working out together to make sure we are. Attacked it as we possibly can. And finally assembly member Lee Monning I after we hear from both of our local community where we are in has everyone picked up a young [inaudible] An agenda. So that you at least here no -- Where we're going to start and perhaps assembly member will it remind everyone who is at home and not if not? I able to follow with the agenda. Of who were all gonna be speaking at the end assembly member. Are going to follow up with legislative update on the work that we've been doing in the budget efforts. You know part of the challenge when you start rebuilding is where's the money. And of course we'll have someone talking about the insurance challenges for private property owners but the state has really tried to step in the federal government stepped in to help us With data of recovery in rebuilt at and yet there's a lot more to do so with that I want to hand The microphone with new batteries over to assembly member of the Monning for opening remarks. Thank you senator and I think you all for being here -- There is a and number of you that are here that been in touch with us throughout this. I'm. I think process throughout the moments that our communities have been living when we decided to move forward with having this hearing.

I'm we've had hearings in Sacramento related to natural disasters to response to recovery and some of you in the room have been able to J.. For those on but we wanted to ensure the you had the opportunity to be here to listen and that we have the opportunity to hear from you. And really the goal of this hearing is simply that and this will be part of our legislative record and it's being recorded it's being life tell about aids it's been at televised on online. I and additionally each of us in our respective legislative houses chairs a committee that rectally addresses the issues that we have lived that we continue to live and made. Continue to live in the future In terms of natural disasters in response and recovery I do want to recognize on as has been said that the work we do we don't do alone. And we do collaborative Lee with individuals with entities with bodies of government and with. Private and public partnerships to understand how.

On the county supervisor das Williams who is here and win M. grief from the school board who you'll hear from I'm in. It's moments and so these are some of the elected offices as well as a lot of our public safety offices that you'll hear from but I wanted to recognize that the work we're doing. Is not them alone and this is part of one part of me convert. I happen out you don't expect that today we will walk away with all the answers or solutions onto these to the magnitude of problems that we've seen. We do expect that this is one piece of a puzzle that dachshunds onto a better solution to a better understanding of the issues that our community is going. Up through and the ways that we can address them within our roles as in the state we have some capacity to address some but that's not the only area are only space where these if it can be addressed. And so I want to recognize that thank you for being here and thank you for being a part of this conversation.

And here mama C. no union school we certainly try to do our part to be stronger together we where the site for water distribution the site first sandbag filling we've been the site for community meetings and insurance meetings and meetings with contractor's.

Good afternoon everyone I Monning your site of the county executive officer for the county Santa Barbara and again welcome and I also want to thank assembly member LeMond and tender Jackson -- They were with us even before the debris flow as the Thomas fire was approaching our boundaries in our borders there with us communicating with us asking what we needed to and preparations we appreciate. Their time they are continuing to lend their assistance and their staffs assistance to us throughout the whole period. And many people don't know that they're actually with us almost daily -- Either in a in person or on the phone in our EEOC during that time as well as our first district supervisor um dos Williams and members of supervisor car I'm. Congressman Carvajal staff. And they're with us on the phone or in person every day in the weeks following the day's Apollo to help us and make sure that we are getting what we are needed. And I have proof of that because I'm not lost five pounds I gained from all the donuts they brought in every single time they came in so thank you for that [inaudible] Home. Well you're gonna hear today is our approach. The key Monticello way of recovery and all disasters or local I think what this has shown us is that this is really been experience. Of neighbors working with neighbors. And residents working with county government. And we know we can't do it alone. And we've relied on and continue to rely on the smarts and the skills and the vigor and energy. Of monitor residents philanthropists and non profits to make all of this recovery work for all of us -- It's also been led buy art the board dos Williams. Who he and his little girl he C. at all the different community means have been? Propelling us forward and making sure that this community is getting all the resources of the county can bring to bear. I'm where you're gonna hear on our discussed recovery plan that's going to be presented to you by Matt Pontus -- My assistant county executive officer who I've dedicated to the recovery effort. On for the last six months and will continue. Is about our plan. Which emphasizes resiliency and understanding the uniqueness of Monticello. Plants focus is on the fundamental that is I. county government can do and can bring to bear. Within our purview that we can actually catalyze it contains an array of actions them at will discuss but it's basically focused on how to reduce. Future risks how we prepare. For the next disaster how can we enable residents to rebuild as quickly as possible and some of you were at the meeting yesterday. Discussing -- The new FEMA maps the County Board of supervisors adopted this plan on June fifth unanimously. In our county recovery team meets every week to drive that plan and make sure we're meeting all those tasks and activities on time. This is still one of the highest priorities for county government. About other things. Not just for our chair dos Williams he's been leading these efforts. But for all the county. So thank you again and without I believe the first panel is ready to go and I'll hand it over to you I believe Matt Pontus once. Introductions are made. You very much. Thank you so much for your efforts. Sorry about the donuts but they really were good -- And and certainly the work that everybody did you I. fire burned for forty days -- Really quite extraordinary unlike any other fire I think that California's had and certainly the largest wildfire in the history of the state. So we are going to go to our first panel are current on the current status of the discovery recovery plan and for those at home who don't have. The agenda we're gonna hear first from out Pontus the director of recovery for Santa Barbara county as chief executive officer Misato mention with their gonna hear from Quinn Laurie. Of who is a representative of the partnership for resilient communities in Wanda's shido which is a sort of public private partnership of very interesting I think creative. Approach to trying to provide additional insight into ways that we can. Recovering go on and then we have cheap I. Eric Peterson who is the for the Santa Barbara county fire department who will give us his. Of use. Been involved in a number of these disasters and has some suggestions and visions that I think will be helpful and then Kate ruby. With the Montesinos center for prepared building -- Many of you. Have seen her there this is an extraordinary community effort to try to make sure that everyone has been impacted has a place to go. I and can get the assistance they need dead during these difficult times so with that Matt if you'd like to go ahead Thank you. Shade that senator Jackson. To get a map partis -- Director of recovery here and I'd like to welcome everybody here tonight. We have an action packed -- Agenda for you so I'm gonna go ahead get started. Really appreciated some of the the comments that the representative from the superintendent's office. Talked about when they talk about structure together. Because if we look at this Republic plan this is something that the county could absolutely Dodd do alone. It took a lot of work from a lot of our partners -- The partnership resilient communities provided an expert to us. That had worked for FEMA and callow yes that helped us a line all of our actions toward. Callaway yes template and FEMA templates so that we were sure that we didn't miss anything as we tried to figure out this incredible puzzle. And provide the community of Mont aceto with all of the tools that they needed to help getting back on their feet. So with that the recovery strategic plan really is our efforts that pulled together all the different disciplines. And it is not what those documents that lives on shelves where. The action versions D.. One of this plan it and the short couple months that we've had because it is change so much Return. And in New I'd come in. We bring him it would solve Mike solving puzzles. And then. We continue to work for them. So based upon those kinds of ideas the plan had to be flexible had to be very efficient with our with our staff time. That absolutely had dated driven decisions being made We I had the end goal of always headed towards a more resilient mosquito community [inaudible] Exide. The plant components had Eight sections. Storm preparation evacuation portion. A long term flood control mitigation [inaudible] Section. Private property rebuilding. Debris on private property and what did there. Financial impacts an economic covering section. Infrastructure repair modifications. The natural resources and cultural section any community engagement portion [inaudible] It's like. With that seven main plan objectives that the planned attempted to achieve. To identify those issues most important to the recovery. Develop a planned to solve the issues. Sure the public is informed of the county's efforts. In the support of money issues recovery through all means available. And that really does mean all means available other state federal and private partnerships all along the way. To engage the public and our elected officials. To determine the best solutions necessary for recovery Slide. Utilize public and private partnerships in all of our recovery efforts. To work with not profits to provide assistance where the government services were able. To or we didn't have enough them. Do you to prepare communities for futures forms back patients. The best data available. You're gonna hear a little bit about that tonight. As we look towards another fall and winter -- Rainy season who wanted to have the most information available and make sure that we're clear. Communicating those evacuations Slide. Yeah last planned objective was developed plans and strategies that address the storm preparation and evacuation. For the next three to five years. Until our vegetation regrows. We have mitigation efforts for future future debris flows. Sure we have a rebuilding process for all different category is of damaged and droid properties. And they were communicating the strategies the community Slide. I'm through a couple issues the first one storm preparation evacuation. And I should know this report really is a very thick report that I'll show you the address of the very end where you can go when. See more depth of the report and what we're doing today is just a really high level -- Topic overview -- If any sections as multiple pages and multiple portions -- Under storm preparation evacuation are Ted us locally here. Is that we're finalizing our criteria for evacuation thresholds. And we know that -- That is really important into how many folks are going to be evacuating this winter we had a lot of resources for John again data behind those decisions. And a team of public safety professionals. And scientists they're working together. To to work on that storm preparation. We're updating the risk map. That has a debris flow -- Portion of it as you're all aware of the hazard maps. We have a contractor that's helping us through that. We're also gonna have starting in September a large outreach and education plan. But we will be back here hopefully again -- Many times before the rainy season [inaudible] Next like. This slide should look familiar to a lot of you and this was the seventy two hour storm evacuation timeline. That we used last year. And so we're gonna be revisiting that time line for this year we're gonna be adjusting it. Will be. Making sure that the things that we worked really well continue. Mendoza is that we need to improve on that we're gonna prove what we had a lot of comments over the last six months on dates that we could do better in this area. And we are taking them all under advisement [inaudible] Slot. Under the long term flood control mitigation us. Consultant that's working on debris based modifications. We have Mike Corbin appears that's been analyzing our basin and our channel capacity. We have a bunch of hazard mitigation grant program that's that acting. H. M. G. P. up there -- And NY preserve intent and these are. Gramps there were going to be going after. That -- Help. Us fund Curt flood control mitigation in the few And we have a lot of information it'll be coming out on that and then months ahead. It will be back in for with one of our board of supervisors in late August discuss some of those -- Medications. Open those -- And applications all they also include a future disposal sites. So we have a place to put the mud and debris and wanted out. Should we get further but and close. And property acquisition for flood ease and flood easements. It's like this. Every property rebuilding. This is one of the most important issues that we took our over the last few months. And will we tried to do was put everything we needed. To put it together to make. Sabol for property owners. Make informed decisions about. The rebuilding options. This included identifying and categorized all impacted properties are planning and develop development department. Together and attractive map that depicts all of the different -- Statuses of those properties. Our borders divisors led by supervisor Dodd Williams. Bob did a like for like ordinance. That was a little more in tune and flexible with the type of conditions that exist here in modest ito. After the brief low. Our coastal commission adopted that like for like ordinance. De our board of supervisors adopted the FEMA map that we talked about last night here at the community meeting -- Helped give. Folks -- Their understanding of the possibilities with flood. Based upon the current condition of the vegetate Jim in the hills Behind us here [inaudible] And we have set up case manager. And a local team of architects and engineers to work together with homeowners. To hopefully wide forks many options it has many different Hannah I. is as possible that help inform them about their decisions It's like. Is you for was to breeze on private property. And as you're all acutely aware this is been an issue that we've been struggling within and working on for romance -- We're still maintain the materials exchange website without a lot of really positive Feedback that that -- Lot homeowners were using that. And being able -- To remove boulders and rocks and and soil from that. Our household waste -- Hazardous waste household hazardous waste pick ups we have completed to those in the community the remove those items from -- The areas that -- There were hazardous in nature. We have ongoing work to try and secure disposal tights. So that we can quickly move and debris should we get future -- Storm events [inaudible] Slide. Issue five in our recovery strategic plan. Dealt more with the financial impacts and the economic recovery of our community. We have a team of folks that are folks dawn full cost recovery -- Through the set Paris M. remembers offices they've been instrumental in helping us with the property. Tax backfill from the state of California [inaudible] That is. Critically important it and given us the tools we have that we need here locally to do some of these hazard mitigation. Projects and other things. We have thirteen had negation grant projects [inaudible] They're submitted. To a total ask of fifty two million dollars. But there would comes with the local match of over twelve million dollars -- We have state and federal level coordination several different kind of matching funds that were working through right now. And we have long term funding sources need four of the capital and the maintenance. We have a flood control district and certainly this event has overwhelmed that district but but we've got some ideas and some others DB G. -- Committee develop blocker and other tools that -- They were hoping that we can use and and leverage some of our other resources with Next slide. Issue six in the recovery strategic plan was infrastructure repair and modifications. And this is an area where we've listed just a few projects here. Most of the projects that we've been working on a bridge improvements in culverts and drainages [inaudible] Drainage facilities to improve though to not only bill back what was destroyed during the one night event. But also enhanced I'm so that they can be more effective should we get additional -- Debris flow and high intensity. We've also done other has delegation projects for Bella Vista. And at least those drive covert replacements and it -- And with the goal to restore those facilities to pre storm. Edition. Seven focused on our natural and cultural resource. As you're aware and those you thing of Ben and Montesinos or live here for a long time -- Looks quite different in many of the areas across mundus ito so we've been in discussions on engaging the community on different kinds of ideas. Potential projects to help restore some of the patrol or cultural resources -- Along the watersheds. We've also been induced should simply was Hannah Barbara land trust. Looking for opportunities to collaborate together. To to provide for some areas that duh. Did help both of you a set back from watercourses. Or allow us to do additional -- Debris basin [inaudible] Jim measures [inaudible] Slide please. This chapter focused on our computer community engagement. One of the I think things that we were able to do. To work collaboratively clap Lee with or fuller foundation. And a whole lot of nonprofits to establish a mansio center. That acted like a hub. Still continues to operate as a hub in the community. Where folks can go in and -- Talk one on one with the person. About the issues are the questions that they have and it's not just call in some phone. Number that connects with somebody -- That they can't see and talk. To this this monitor Skinner has facilitated. A lot of outreach to a lot of impacted residents. And we've also engage the philanthropic sector -- And lot of nonprofits as you all of our where have come together. To really -- Address all of the community needs.

Across the entire -- Thomas fire one night briefs and throughout recovery an array SPT Dodd or well plight -- Has been up there were post all of our newest information. We take Jim -- Noble it or is that in a way that it clear and easy to read. And I've included newsletters other things for folks out. Slide please ongoing needs ten you. Have ongoing beads as we continue to move through the different phases of the recovery. Jean Ewing of the disaster declaration [inaudible] The level. To those future events Looking The group. So next I'd like to introduce. When look hope questioner? I think it I think if we may just take questions toward the end because otherwise we're not going to get through this -- Program and we want to hear from everyone so say that program I got a couple. To and if we could ask you know more than ten minutes so that we are. Out we didn't prepare dinner for everybody so wanna get people out here so they can go home but Quinn anxious to hear what you have to say so if. Thank you senator Jackson -- Mona I I was thinking as you were talking about the five pounds you gain that I was started to wonder about the environmental impact of the collective weight we've all games and thinking that maybe we need to put together like a community -- Health program after we get through the resiliency plan. I'm [inaudible] So. I. in over the last few weeks will bite most her young schreiben watching with great interest the rescuing of these Boys in Thailand in this cave and you know I think there's some real parallels here there were in murky waters and at there's not enough ox been. I and we need guidance -- To get is to a safer place and I I just want to say that we're so grateful. To have such incredible leadership -- In the state -- Senator Jackson and and assembly member at low Monning and in our county Dawson and Mona and all in the CIOS office we we really I personally been so impressed and so heartened by the coming together of this community so. Thank you so much for that I'm. I was asked. To represent my group which is the partnership for resilient communities. And let me just give you a little background and how we came together -- The core team of my group I is Brett Matthews who is the former actually president of the school board money cedar union school and is an entrepreneur and kind of expert in public private partnerships -- Joe Cole that chair of the Planning Commission and the land use lawyer in -- Munna Seto -- Pat McElroy former Santa Barbara city fire chief. Less Fierstein contractor builder innovator happens to be my husband but I would have married again after I've seen the kind of effort he's put into this endeavor -- Mary Rose who is a public policy consultant has been an amazing partner in this I. leaks Mattingly another local person and really what happened is after the debris flow. We all came together and like so many people we were looking for our lane -- Of where to help and we went to the county -- And basically said how can we help you manage this. Thing that none of us have have ever seen before or we were all in over our heads. And we've basically said we want to help you make our community as safe as possible and put together a plan so that we can emerge. Quote the six million dollar man better stronger faster -- And really get through this as a more resilient community and not. A double negative not not be able to do things because NY. One edge of government didn't have the bad with of the money to do it. So that was really our goal was just what can we do now to make us more safe. To make them mountain more safe and that's really where this all began -- We started by engaging leaders looking around because we all know that. As much as this was a new thing for our community or not the first community to experience. The error -- Event that you know that how to do with. Wildland urban interface and and so there were other people in Switzerland in Washington state in you know all over our country in the world in Japan who have gone through the sorts of things and there are experts out there including local experts at the brand school all. You know geologists in people who have been thinking about these things forever. And who really at important information to teach us about technology that's out there and things that we can -- Do now we engaged immediately James Lee Witt who is the former head of theme my and previously worked with the local partnership that built the counties -- Aware and prepare pro -- And the emergency operations center we hire. Admiral Thad Allen -- From the coast are who had real experience in dealing with -- These kinds of natural disasters and we hired David through could Tony who -- To work as a bridge between our group and the county -- And David I. is the former deputy director of cal O. yes and former senior official FEMA so he had some real expertise to bring -- To is issues as well -- And of course you know our most important partners have been the county in the state -- CDL Mona my Sato who has been really from the very beginning and I'm gonna need some of these names then I'll quickly get. To what we're actually doing but the fact that these people who are so overwhelmed. Open up their arms. To a partnership. And really -- Welcome at the help and you know joined arms without was so impressive to us and heartening and I I just can't tell you how much we appreciate it -- Matt pond is who -- Was supposed to be less interesting so that I would some more interesting but that didn't work out -- Senator Jackson -- Assemblywoman low moan -- Both of these leaders state leaders and their from day one were saying. You know what do you think king like out there open to why does wanted to do everything they could to support this community and that's been amazing -- Supervisor Williams who has I know lost so much sleep from the day this happened you know wanting to be there for this community and wanting -- To you know. Solve the problem that seemed unsolvable so I you know that's been incredible on the minds C. to association Bob hazards writing on this issue for the modesty to journal has been so helpful to all of us I'm super. Superintendent rain I you have opened the school in a way that I know of so we are also grateful -- For great support from theme of all of this and so. Really I'm. Our partnership let me just tell you sort of some of the things that we're looking at that we've been discussed with the county and trying to do because really we want to get some mitigation. Up on the mountain. For you know December before the next rains because that's what we're all concerned that we're all concerned about. You know temporary [inaudible] Solutions before that natural re growth can happen on the mountain and some of the on technologies that we're looking at our monitors that can give us real time data about. Things that are happening up on the mountain -- One of the technologies that seem to be used around the world. Often and most effectively are debris nets that -- I happen to be in. Switzerland for a conference in June and saw them all over the mountains in Switzerland. And that they they actually have saved lots of property and lots of lights around the world so we're looking at doing temporary netting -- That is environmentally bed that has been as I said use all over the world and hopefully the first canyon will be able to put Pat and as the Buena Vista canyon because that canyon. Does not have a debris basin at the bottom of it so we're hoping to be able to get this done and again. The county in the state has been so I'm. Working with that hand in hand and try to do everything we could to with they can to get. Sort of emergency stays on you know certain. Approvals we would have to get to do this -- In a more permanent way or if we had eternal time to get it done I the other things we're looking at is trying to help the county Enhance the existing debris base the network -- That we have to help accelerate regrowth. And ultimately what we all know is that the entire problem is a water problem. And I know all of mine to see those very focused on really wanting to solve our all of that. State of California. It certainly minus it was very focused on how to solve this problem -- And there are many things that we're looking at doing a facilitate better ongoing hydration of the mountain -- Certainly if pot growers could do it. We can do it. I I and a so that you know that involves better water catchment Irrigation innovative ways to get water on the mountain -- Like things like do harvesting and atmospheric water and other. Things that were just considering because we sort of feel like we are limited only by the boundaries of our imagination. And our imaginations and into the partnerships that were able. To forum and yet one of the groups that I didn't mention who have been so incredibly -- Well we all know how amazing that. You no the firefighters and law enforcement in Santa Barbara county have been. Unbelievable heroes in this whole thing and have really stepped outside of I think everyone's stepped outside of their comfort zone and of sort of you know come to the table to have the eager conversations about how everything in pan. Everything else and so we're so grateful to have [inaudible] Such amazing -- Leadership -- On that front [inaudible] And I think I will. Leave it there except to say that -- You know the habitat. No you in terms of the state we appreciate. Not just everyone's talked about the backfill and I know we're sitting in the auditorium and our school district appreciate so much -- The backfill abut the economic implications we know are going to be more than a year. So we're really hoping to find longer term solutions -- As the mountain heels and our economy. He'll so thank you for the opportunity to be here today and we do have -- Serve a brochure or at the back about what we're doing and we're setting up a website to update with ongoing technologies were looking at and and where. Endeavoring to pursue and we're also doing this with the help of some very generous people in this community who have written some. Very generous chaps to find what we're trying to do so that's kind of the private piece of this partnership is. You know we're trying to pull our personal wait in. Getting us to higher ground thank you. Thank you thank you when. And I. suspected people have some good ideas that you are going your folks are receptive if somebody -- Has a suggestion that You might. Interesting considering they could they should come contact you on that as well [inaudible] I'm work. Beyond being receptive we need we have had I named the kind of five or six core members of this group but we have had so much input from members of this community. The resources that we have more than anything in this community our human resources and it is unbelievable the expertise and that. Creative and strategic thinking is going on in this community and the people who have come together to sit with us and help us think these things through and I think I mentioned the ministerial association is one of the groups that's been. So supportive of the work we're doing and wanting to link arms with us and so yes absolutely we are. Beyond open to input Chief. Thank you are pretty being here. If the invitation I've also gained a lot of weight during this whole thing [inaudible] Any consolation. Up I want to talk about. Some things are working in our favor during this whole endeavor some challenges were having moving forward we're gonna continue to have some degree. And a to do list -- I'll start with the things working in our favor -- I've worked in this organization I lived in pan on my whole life. And I've never seen the fire departments in this up very again along the way. Right now are are her coordination communication with each other -- The relationships we have with each other -- Honestly has never been better than it is right now and I think some of that is because of the personalities that are involved a lot of it is because and the challenges that we've all had to face together the experiences we've gained. But that is a that's a any part of it too is. Pat McElroy here he was the old city -- Citigroup recent retired C. fire chief used to tend bar together that might have some to do with it -- But we have a really good unified -- Group of fire chiefs and fire departments here in this county right now -- Public private partnerships its partnership for the resulting for resuming communities is is really just an incredible example and very unique to our county -- The the the the public sector in the private sector working together and helping each other out -- It's a really encouraging sign when you see things like that to spring up out of nowhere. And I find that to be extremely encouraging -- Quick government solutions -- Let's face it government typically is not particularly nimble -- We have really nice examples recently of the government acting quickly -- To make a real difference is on in the field and on the ground Senator Jackson's recent effort and and assembly member low moans recent effort -- To lobby the governor to add additional monies for the pre positioning. Of fire and EMS resources in front of predicted whether of weather events -- Made a major impact on this holiday fire that we recently had just last weekend -- We're actually the first -- Agent we were the first fire where these funds were utilized In this unique fashion and we he met the thresholds that were set down by cal fire or or I should also say that our relationship with cal fire with our our federal partners has never been stronger also we have Tom Porter from California with us -- We met the thresholds. And we really prepa addition five resources five five fire engines a strike team essentially who would not have had otherwise -- Putting at the corner of Hollister and turnpike and they were. There for two hours before the holiday fire broke and they were at work -- Read literally within minutes of of of the fire starting so that is an example of government being nimble and making a real Solid example so we've that I think is extremely courage and we have an engaged community obviously -- This monster recovery center that the county is putting out there again I've been here for thirty two years almost. And I was here for the paint fire it was here for he's see that the I don't remember the county being. Leaning this far forward -- Connie recovery effort -- Ever before and you know part my C. E. O.. Mona has given up after staff. She's having to do a lot of met partisans work -- Lately -- But I I I think those are very encouraging things -- So those are good things other challenges were having moving forward. At the most we have about months to do fire prevention and any kind of substantive fuel management -- Because of this climate change We literally just don't have the time that we used to we used to have sort of a semi well defined fire season. Stevo Safar marshals in the back when we came on together when we came on there was a fire season and there was a non fire season. And on fire season is when you get all your training did all your fire your your your fuel management -- And we don't have that kind of time anymore and and the I. it my opinion the fire service needs to adapt to that and we're still in the in the process of trying to do that -- I should also say that when I speak I'm I'm I'm speaking for all the fire certain not to speaking as a county fire chief we have to pick men here -- Kevin Taylor Travis is here from the different from my seat of fire department I I think they all agree with the things that I'm saying -- We have a difficult time getting getting this work done because on top of the fact that we're always on fire it seems like -- The demand for mutual aid resources out of our county -- Is extremely strong -- Because we ask for so much help here locally we are duty bound to provide health. Provide Mitchell laid out a county and in fact in this holiday fuller broke we had a strike team out of county and and I think once you have some people out also. So it's really a year round issue that we are still coming to grips with and we have more work to do -- We have less time to do environmental review -- For fuel management projects -- There some misinformation out there that -- That I think is proposes didn't used to pose a big challenges it as it does now but it poses a bigger challenge now -- Manager burns if you'll breaks. Our our tools that we need at as fire departments and fire fighters. And when and there's misinformation out there about the efficiency of the effectiveness of those tools -- Eight makes our job harder and I find it personally affect offense -- We would not have been able to stop the Thomas fire -- Without the good work that might aceto did providing the fuel breaks in the thinning around the back. Of must feel that is what Scott that fire in another field brick running up to you to Roth road We could not have put four hundred fire trucks in a thousand firefighters are. More than more more firefighters even then that appear to stop this thing unfortunately we were unable. To save the watershed -- Convincing the public that when we say that this is the new normal we really mean -- I don't wanna sound gloom and doom but when we say this is the new normal what that really means. To us as firefighters is this is not a hope we're gonna get over this [inaudible] Is [inaudible] Is. This is reality now we're not gonna get over this it's not going to get better and so as a community and as a fire service we need to adapt to that. That's a challenge -- Very difficult to coordinate local state and federal land owners -- Ranchers farmers the environmental community elected officials -- In time to do subsidy fuel management projects really really difficult it was difficult in the old days before it got like it is now -- And it's even more difficult now and that's what my whole Mitchell but later here. Learning from history I I I think that we really especially here in Santa Barbara county. We need to learn from history -- In nineteen ninety I was I was here three years as a firefighter. And we had the predicate fire and very similar conditions that we had at the holiday fire -- What we keep learning is that these fires -- They like to start up in the mountains they like to run down in the populated areas -- Take homes and kill people they run back up in the hills at night in their run back down the next day it happened during the T. fire happened during his C. to fire. But what is happening now and I think what we really need to be aware of unconscious above is. Interval between those events used to be five to ten years -- Now if we get whether. Generally speaking we're gonna get a fire -- The interval between those large catastrophic events is increasing. And we need to adapt to that we need to take substantive action. So are here's my here's my to do list. In my opinion we need a countywide I don't know if this is the correct terminology or what we're even gonna call this thing but I believe that we need a countywide fuel management working group. Comprised of all those people that all those members of organizations that I just mentioned that need to be coordinated nor to get any work done -- We need to get those people the environmental community. Elected officials state federal. And local fire agencies. And we need to get planned together with the priority being we need a front country feel break in this in this town we need test [inaudible] To put. Some form of a fuel break that runs from the good work that mocks you already did. Alway out to behind the leader It can take the form of actual manage actual fuels removed either through hand crews goats a canticle means -- Or can take the that form of agriculture -- You know I I think there are friends of ours the agriculture community would. You say that but avocados and ag belts. I act as big hit he and they they take up a lot of members you know when we had the sure fire -- The avocado orchards out there when a long way toward saving Toledo from from from catastrophic A loss. So we need to have we need to connect the dots in the front country or we are just going to be in my opinion. Fits with this problem over and over again it's a heavy lift -- There's a lot of assets there's a lot of there's a lot of apple carts that. That a will be upset in the process but I think until we do something are on that scale. We are going to continue C. these problems and finally I have to throw this in there we need to unify our dispatch services in this county -- Right now in this county we have five dispatch centers. It's not unified we respond on most of the time different frequencies it creates problems for us on small scale bird to seize and particularly in large scale emergencies -- During the debris flow during the Thomas fire. We had difficulties because we were not responding on the same frequency oftentimes we what are our mobile data computers are fire trucks once in the scene Thing. So situational awareness that responding resources had going in these large incidents was not as good as it could have been and it's a problem. We are far too forward thinking. Of accounting and of a community to have an unified dispatching environment is something we absolute need to fix I'm working my C. Yom -- Monning Misato dust Williams just left there where the problem we're looking at active Solutions met Pontus is part of the part of the team -- But that's a big one on the to do list facing these major catastrophes as we move forward. Thank you thank you chief we've written it down both of us so thank you. And so people aren't to discourage we are actually moving on those -- Levels and we'll talk about that a little later thank you and now Katie dedicate which you share with us what's going on if you could keep it under ten minutes at a great camp. I I'm Kate we be I am the director of the institute for collective trauma and growth. And we have been -- Working for years now and asters and long term I. recovery efforts around the country and we happen to be based here and so were immediately responsive and and created a local project that we're calling the revere care center and we set up offices in the monocyte of Skinner. And I also serve as the long term recovery I. group chair. And so in that role I've been working very closely with Ben Romano and other county representatives and especially as we've seen how -- Helpful and successful the Montesinos center has been -- This collaborative effort has really -- And and the hub that Matt talked about has really helped to create kind of a one stop shop that people could go to for the wide range of it's that -- Are part of the long term recovery effort. And so that this collaboration is not going to end anytime soon and we'll be together at least through -- The next evacuation season so at least through March and we have started conversations -- About the possibility of remaining in the same location As we are right now and so if that changes at all we will for sure update the public -- As soon as possible -- And right now some of that the reason that we are forecasting that way is because while the modesty of center was effective immediately -- Everyone processes trauma and goes through their own -- Sense of disaster at their pace and so while many people -- Sought out resources right away they're people who are just starting to come to seek out services right now. They're just starting to realize That maybe they weren't -- As insured as they thought they were or or their rebuilding efforts are costing. They're just starting to feel some of the impacts of the motion on and spiritual and psychological impacts -- They're just starting -- To recognize some of the longer term impacts on their businesses and so -- We have services at Montesinos honor to address that wide range of needs [inaudible] Great. Thank you very much -- And again will have questions at the end if we could call up our second panel now thank you folks you really have. Done an amazing job let's. Give a round of applause. So our next panel is Tom Eric Allama row with the yum. Cal away assets C. office of emergency services who have been. Sort of helping to coordinate these efforts from the state level -- Providing money and resources and leadership. And then I'm gonna passes back to my colleague to identify the next members. We also have a a chief Tom Porter who is here adjoining us from the southern region -- He's a southern region chief for cal fire who we've worked very closely with. As well as Dave Edwards from and he's bureau chief of the claim service bureau in the consumer service division for California's department of insurance. This panel and is again focus on some the efforts that the state has engaged in in response -- It to that natural disasters and the post natural disaster situations so we will start I'm with Eric lateral -- I do want to note that and we do have some who's keeping time in case you need any suggestions of sitting here in the front row. And the and will flag just I'm kind of the minute warnings for S. and to please had. Thank you very much summit member senator for having us here today -- I'm gonna -- And build upon moments of RD been made -- There's some areas have been touched on wear a through the legislative action and the governor's action we got funding to support -- Our programs ahead of the Vance. Sorry about that that better yeah. I want to reinforce some of the points have been made -- In terms of how the some of the funding that's been have provided by the legislature and the governor to support -- Resource deployments ahead of them it's as well as to look at hazard mitigation -- We've certainly at the governor's office of emergency services. Learned a tremendous amount -- Through the events of twenty seventeen obviously here first and foremost of the Thomas fire in the one nine debris flow. But unfortunately across California twenty seventeen was a really catastrophic year from. The significant flooding events we had throughout California at the beginning the year. Our crisis at the Oroville lake Oroville facility. And then bookending with the events. I'm from October through December unfortunately throughout California we lost eleven thousand homes and businesses. Throughout all these events on M. is senator Jackson highlighted earlier tremendous And unacceptable loss of life across those events -- Locally we have continued to remain engaged -- Here in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and throughout this region in supporting the significant debris removal operations -- Here in Santa Barbara county -- Overseeing the U. S. army corps of engineers programs to to clear our channels on our basins Downturns Jr accounting. Leading up the debris from seven hundred homes that were lost during the Tom spire. No what we've realizes there's tremendous success based on the partnerships of local state and federal partners and the leadership. Of local officials both during response and into recovery here in Santa Barbara. Has been a tremendous I'm our team has been engaged on both the disaster response and recovery -- Here at that San Santa Barbara EOC and in working with Matt his recovery team and will continue To and as we've -- Worked to ensure that there's an expeditious flow of federal and state dollars for those recovery efforts. You were working on what can we do better to be -- Better prepared for that next to that -- Through the will the leadership of the governor and director Gil duty -- Earlier this year after the catastrophic debris flow when we saw additional events coming in additional weather events -- We actually did something we've never done before we pre positioned recovery resources -- We mobilize a state agency experts from the department of water resources and Caltrans and other agencies. As well as we pass the federal government with mobilizing the US army corps of engineer contractors in the event that we had another event like the one nine flow. So that we could expeditiously get in there and clean up debris and get the community back on its feet fortunately. Those storms did manifest the way we thought they were going to but we were per aired for that -- Additionally -- As we saw most recently. With the fires last week. I'm we had the ability -- Through additional funding in legislation that have been authorized to pre position critical resources to support Santa Barbara county -- As was noted we had. Twenty five million dollars in funding statewide -- We have the ability now to pre positioning coordination with cal fire and local partners Critical resource. Critical -- Firefighting response resources as well as other M. Nancy management resources -- To be prepared when we've got events that meet the critical -- Whether in other threshold factors that are considered we had five of Callaway esses engines here Hannah Barbara as noted. Those engines were [inaudible] Holiday fire [inaudible] Time we had six local governments [inaudible] Directing. Positioned in Los Angeles some of those engines and it up getting deployed. An additional response up here in in because of the the funding that was available in the program that's in place we're able to back fill those in the event that it [inaudible] Significant fire a broken in Los Angeles during that time -- We were also fortunate during the holiday fire to the federal fire management assistance grant It's probably the fastest approval I've ever seen -- For a FEMA fire management assist [inaudible] And all [inaudible] Very fortunate [inaudible] Federal government [inaudible] On while we've been working Fireside [inaudible] Need. Ahead of the Vance. We all can in your work. Developing standards at the state level. I know there's legislation Centered we're trying to be ahead of that by developing standards [inaudible] That can. Coincide with whatever legislation gets passed -- We've formed a committee -- That's developed on a draft recommendations on that are currently under review that that will establish a standard. Eighteen a base level for all alert warning throughout California -- That we can -- Uses a model especially help jurisdictions that aren't as robust in terms of alert warning and Santa Barbara and Ventura are. So lot of lessons are being learned and best practices being you realize that we've been seeing down here. The final -- Areas all touch on that Matt touched on earlier -- Is the state hazard mitigation grant funding -- There's a program after every major a presidential disaster where 20% of the overall cost of that disaster. Gets applied to additional funding that's allocated to the state. To provide funding grants to local governments to take steps to mitigate future losses future disasters. Although -- This funding is driven by fires The grants themselves apply for flood mitigation for fire mitigation for earthquake Across California. Through the October disasters and December does a disaster if three and seventy one million dollars here in Santa Barbara county. There been -- Fifty nine Wilk what's called notice of interests that have been submitted to us we've approved fifty of those in the counties now working. On many of those to submit applications to us and so will continue to provide subject matter expertise to them as they work through that grant development process and look forward. To as some of those actions being implemented from flood mitigation measures that that. That Matt touched on to fire clearance -- Efforts on another flood control measures that will greatly enhance -- The ability to reduce low. So I think you very much for allowing us to be here today. Think. And upfront thank you. I thought senator Jackson and assembly a member of the Monning for having us here -- I think this could be the the panel of we're from the state we're here to help -- And Hannah I I I I see that with a little bit of a joke in my voice -- Only because we that truly is what were best -- Here to do is help your local -- Government officials and your local -- Departments -- To recover from what you've been through -- And I I I don't think it's lost on any of you that that the frequency is -- Has increased -- Dramatically -- Here in the front country of Santa Barbara county it's increased in your back country as well -- You've had more fires in the last -- Five years -- On average then -- In the period that long. Or that of of that length -- In the past so -- Santa Barbara's not unlike the rest of the state -- As senator Jackson Jackson mentioned -- The climate change is changing the fire environment and in general -- It can be said no matter where you are in California -- Every acre can and will burn at some point. And we're just seeing more frequent and larger -- Displays of that -- As we are so with that -- Where are we with -- The new normal -- The new normal is the normal -- And so we're we are. Changing that vernacular within our our department -- Because new normal that was good two years ago -- This year in going for work we're at a point where this is the normal. And the state -- Has through through much of the effort of of your officials appear on the stage but also on the backs of of you when the local -- Elected officials. Had have made a Andy astronomical investment in the future of of the fire services In general in California Or is. Working hard to meet the the expectations of the funding that has been. Pushed in our direction -- Through -- Increasing our the readiness of our fleet -- We've increased some numbers of firefighting -- Capable resources both human and and equipment -- We're increasing our our commitment to our environmental planner types who will be helping with our in secret clearance -- For fuels reduction work and prescribed fire. And let me just give you some of the the the numbers -- Seeking -- Reference these going forward and you couldn't you can pull these out of the the governor's executive order -- For force management -- But also -- Some of the that numbers of of dollars that have are coming out of of the current budget -- Sixteen million dollars will -- Worth of a replacement for equipment -- Vehicles that we've been sorely needing M. and behind on replacement umps will be up upgrading our our fleet -- A ten million dollars in community based fire prevention work that's going to be coming directly down to the ground level and for our communities to draw on through their local -- County fire and or cal fire units -- To to work on local based again this is for us to help you help yourselves to become more resilient -- In protection of your communities -- From wildfire in their disasters There are going to be -- Six fire -- Fuels management crews that the state is is -- Going to hire and have as a permanent -- Piece of our our arsenal and they're knocking me fire going crews they're gonna trained to fire going standards and they will react if there's a fire locally. But their whole mission for those six cruise is going to be fuels work. So that's something that we're gonna be doing throughout the state and where there's a critical need -- We will move those crews into those areas and do those projects and then -- Respond accordingly and and retract accordingly. We got the fires. There last year's budget had two hundred million dollars worth of of fuels management -- Dollars that has right now -- Almost all been allocated to large scale projects across California -- We a have been -- Getting a grant money for fuels project work and the hundreds of thousands to several million dollars -- Per year and targeting those -- Two places where they would have been needed. These are going in large chunks to large landscape level projects to do watershed level work. And so -- Some some of those funds will be coming -- To the local area. We'll be touching every -- Every part of California. This year an additional hundred and sixty million dollars to is going into the same program so. Between last year and this year three hundred sixty plus million dollars are going to fuels -- Related work -- To help -- Towards. Mitigating the forced up issues but also the the fuels issues around communities. The other part of the executive order -- Point toward increasing the pace and scale of of work on the landscape -- To reduce fuels. Are we are currently doing an average of approximately two hundred and fifty thousand acres of of project work across the state. We will -- Be increasing that to approximately a half million acres -- If you look at that as a whole -- It's it's not enough on the on the entire statewide basis but the federal got black. For service and federal agencies are committing to an additional half million acres of one million -- Per year that we are looking at moving toward -- Over the next several years. The we're gonna be doing more our education and outreach and certifying more individuals and departments in prescribed. We're gonna be looking at the liability issue of that and fearing out ways that we can work toward shared liability -- In some fashion under a controlled setting. And streamlining the permitting process to get from. A planned burn or project. To the work being done on around. There the governor -- Enacted a tree mortality taps force I'm sorry tree mortality task force that was last year last three years. That has morphed into the forest management task force force management task force is going to be working with all -- All of the state agencies and our federal counterparts. To do all of these things that I mentioned previously. But to to collaborative Lee -- Come to a point where world we're speaking with one voice -- In moving toward -- More resilient Morrell zillion forests and more resilient. And Evert me say Forrest several times. Forest is what we have behind you -- If you think of forest like the Forest Service because their poorest. And we have a lot of acres of forest that are in southern California that have no trees on but that is still is Boris so -- When I'm to it when I'm saying these and and -- Working through some of the issues that that we are going to be working through over the next several years and possibly decades -- Think of the forest as everything that's out your backdoor. And know that we only control and and I have the the ability to work on those private lands there between us and the federal government. But also know that the federal lands managers are committed to working with us to move forward on on the things that we need to to have. Resilient forests watersheds and communities [inaudible] Thank. Skinner Jackson is them we member limo and thank you for the opportunity for us to be here tonight putting this together. My name is Dave Edwards I'm the chief of the clan services bureau of the department of insurance my team is responsible for assisting survivors with their parents claims on the speeds. Richards commissioner Dave Jones who was able to visit Santa Barbara county a number of times earlier this year and wanted me to convey his continued commitment. To using all the powers of his office. To assist survivors. First I'd like to provide the community in the committee with updated insured loss claims data from the two thousand seventeen wild fires as well as the two thousand eighteen Montecito mudslides. From October December two thousand seventeen wildfires in northern and southern California more than fifty three thousand claims have been filed. Seventy two hundred of these have been total loss claims. As of our most recent data the total insured losses now exceed twelve point five billion dollars. From the December two thousand seventeen Thomas fire alone that impacted Santa Barbara and Ventura counties more than nine thousand four hundred claims have been filed and more than seven hundred of those were total loss claims. The Tom aspire is now approaching two billion dollars an insured losses. As you know the mind of C. to mudslides cause significant property damage and tragic loss of life. More than twenty eight hundred claims been filed with more than a hundred fifty of these being total loss claims. And the total insured losses from the mud slide now exceeds six hundred fifty million dollars. Now this date is from homeowners commercial and auto insurers in the private market. It does not include any claims have been filed under the flood program. Now Mike provided a brief summary of what commissioner Jones in the department have been doing since the onset of these terrible events. In the northern and southern California fires commissioner Jones in the department took a number of immediate steps to help affected residents and communities -- He signed orders to cut through the red tape allowing insurance companies to move more quickly to provide advance payments tell presidents get the resources they need. To start the recovery in rebuilding process. We mobilized our disaster response teams were provide service to wildfires survivors. We issued notices to make sure that insurance professionals including. Professional a public adjusters insurers and claims adjusters. We're reminded of their obligations to know and follow all laws pertaining the claim settlement. Including the California unfair practices act. The fair claim settlement practice rags and additional consumer protections that supersedes standard policy language when there's a declared disaster. Such as was the case with these fires and the muscle. In addition our consumer services team was deployed to local assistance centers providing a one on one support for thousands of fire survivors. Our investigators detectives were from our enforcement branch teamed up. With the contractors state license board and local district attorneys to attend cat town hall meetings. Visit affected neighborhoods and educate residents on how to avoid scam artists. Pray on disaster victims after the disaster occurs. Commissioner Jones issued a notice to insurance carriers asking them to waive the requirement of a detailed home inventory. For policy holders and pay up to a 100% of the contents coverage. So that fired -- Survivors who experienced a total loss could be spared the painful task of trying to remember in list every item they owned. The insurers that agreed to comply with our request made up more than 98%. The the total loss clings fired filed as a result of the two thousand seventeen wildfires. Regarding the January mudslides commissioner Jones toured the impact -- Locations we deployed our disaster response teams to the areas to assist people at the local acceptance centers we also held town hall meetings and workshops to assist as many survivors as possible. In January of this year. After hearing that some insurance companies were advising their insurance that mud slide damage was not covered under the homeowner policy. Commissioner Jones issued unnoticed all property insurers this notice reminded insurers of the efficient proximate cause doctrine which is California law. Their duty was to cover damages from the recent mudslides and debris flows if it was determined. The Tom aspire was the efficient proximate cause of the mud slides. The preliminary and subsequent information showed that the Thomas fire which was a covered peril. What the official proximate cause of the subsequent mud flow mudslides and debris flows? Therefore we do expect insurers to cover these claims under the property owners homeowner's insurance policy. As well as under commercial policies in most cases We understand. The for those whose homes are covered under the national flood insurance program their claims may be completely or partially covered under those policies as well. The department held several one on one workshops allowed survivors the opportunity to speak with department claims experts in a private session. On the central coast those workshops were held in February both inventor and Senate Barbara and again in April in. Santa Barbara. We met with hundreds of survivors during those workshops. In all commissioner just ones are and my staff met with more than five thousand survivor statewide in these various venues. After meeting with fires survivors across the state and having heard first and the challenges they were facing. Commissioner Jones directed the department of insurance to develop a package of proposed statutory changes to strengthen the law in this area. The department sponsored and drafted several bills. That would assist current and future survivors of wildfires and other disasters with their recovery. Several of several of these bills are still active and it is our hope they will be enacted in its strong the form as possible. Some statistics today the department received four hundred sixty two consumer requests for assistance or complaints. Relating to the October December wildfires. Many of these cases are under investigation still but so far through our intervention we have been able to recover more than forty million dollars for survivors. For the Tom aspire the department received eighty four consumer requests for assistance and so far we've been able to recover four million dollars the Thomas wildfire survivors. For the money Seto went mudslides the department has not received a large number of complaints. Especially after commissioner Jones issued his January notice. Advising Richard the efficient proximate cause doctrine we received about twenty complaints. I would like to say that if any member of the public. Has suffered a loss from the mud slides please file your claim with your insurance company. If that claim is denied or even delayed please contact the department and filed a request for assistance. Now last week the department receipt to specific questions from committee staff I would like to address those questions. The first question involves insureds to do not feel that their insurers providing adequate compensation for their claim we were asked. What would your office suggest they do next to rebut the insurance companies offer? Are there resources that either your office or another entity can offer to guide individuals through this process. In the case were insured is at an impasse with their insurer in feels they're not they're not being fairly compensated. We would ask that you immediately contact the department's we sign the case to an insurance compliance officer who can seek to resolve the dispute. Our department staff have the expertise to resolve many of these disputes and if there's issue that we cannot. Have that cannot be resolved through our wrecked intervention the department administers a statutory disaster mediation program. Under that program survivor may wish to enter into mediation where we assign an outside mediator to seek resolution of the claim dispute issue. This mediation program is free for a consumer. It is non binding. So if the consumers not happy with the suggested supplement the consumer may walk away and pursue other remedies. At the conclusion of this hearing a member of my team will be in the back of the auditorium with brochures that describe the mediation program. The second question we were asked. In isn't imply that some insurers are the lane mud slide damage claims. In order to wait for a report or updated FEMA maps. The question also suggested that updated FEMA maps may be used an impact future insurance rates in premium. In the area of the months like. The department is not aware of any insurer that is waiting on a theme of report or updated map to invent or in order to investigate evaluate were settled either wildfire or much like claim. We have received no complaints that any insurers Dillane settlement of claims waiting for report or updated map. If their is a constituent that is experiencing to delay by their insurer on the this basis they should immediately contact us. The question also refers of the possible readjustment insurance rates. Insurance rates are regulated by the department under very strict standards uninsured may not automatically raise rates and therefore individual insurance the insurance premiums. Without first meeting a new rate filing with the department's rate regulation branch. That filing must then be approved by the department. Therefore we do not expect there to be any immediate rate premium impact as a result of new reports or mapping of the modesty to area. However the department will obtain a review any reports or maps that are prepared. Lastly for a type of insurance issue or dispute if any member of the public is having difficulty with. Or just not sure about the advice being given by nature an adjuster an agent or broker. Please contact our consumer services team toll free at Or you can visit us online at insurance dot CA dot gov. Now we can't resolve all the issues of disputes that are brought to our attention but we certainly cannot help. If we're not contacted. This concludes my testimony for any of those would like the department to review their case. An officer of my team is in the back of the room afterwards to provide our requests for assistance forms. Thank you. Well thank you. Thank you this is been helpful other senator and I are going to give a brief legislative update in terms of what each of us -- And what the state has been working on and then following that we will open it up for public comments I hope the evolving taking notes and keeping your questions together. Us Sacramento has been particularly busy -- In response to the natural fires up the senator and I have not only met with our colleagues that represent some of the most impacted and I. areas in northern California. I'm on a periodic basis to discuss I'm a collective effort in terms of moving forward but there have been many members on in the legislature who have proposed a series of bills. That we have a list -- And for those of you who may want to you can you can get at the back of the room are and in the front of the the hall. I'm with over forty bills that were introduced in. This legislative year. That relate to natural disaster response and recovery I think that some of our panelists M. in this last panel have alluded to bills are still alive some of those bills. I'm are no longer in place. And a few of those bills have been introduced by the both of us and we have been working together on on the bills that we're moving forward one of the bills that M. that. I co that I authored it have the senator is a co author is. An office of emergency service translation bill we know and we heard loud and clear as did northern California -- How important it was to get timely and for the state in a state that represents over 44% of individuals who speak a language other than English in their home? On and that is something that we are working on unfortunately bill that we that we did start to work on the but that did not make it M. all the way was the consolidated removal program. What you have all experienced in terms of the services with a consolidated debris removal is something that is not law it eight tends to happen? On because we work on it to make it happen M. but that is not a law and we are working and I will look likely revisit it in the coming years and that that is a bill that died -- Bills die in a number of six to eight different process and they can die in different ways and it so that was one of them. Out we did have actually. Add that to the cal fire chief mentioned one of the bills and that we authored which is the fire prevention activities local assistant grant program. And as a over ten million dollars to create. A new fire prevention working group composed of representatives and stakeholders from state agencies local governments I. academia interests industry and nonprofits that have experience. An arm vault in state fire prevention at the schools a working group up with the grant program at to identify what those methods are. At those are some of them I know that we additionally have some budget -- Work that we've we've. Been able to successfully get to work group and the state I'm representatives on that some of those -- Fun to include -- Backfill for property taxes for both Ventura and Santa Barbara county add backs bill for attendance related loss and school districts -- And that's specific to K. twelve and community college at school districts we do have a as well as and some. Some match money for a the Associated add debris removal for both Fincher and Santa Barbara county as well. And so those are some of the efforts I think add that we've engaged in everything we've done as a center has said we've done together not just on because we represent the disk. But we've also done it with colleagues on in northern California and colleagues in the state legislature [inaudible] As well. I and I I would say that it's this whole circumstance with the Thomas farmer summer prescient Yeah I have I chair the joint committee on emergency management -- And have been very actively involved in this issue since I was elected to the Senate I chaired it for the first session which is two years. As a vice chair last year and the chair this year and it so happened that. On December fourth. I was chairing a committee meeting on the early alert systems -- Having gone out to northern California and had my first helicopter experience one of those really clunky old National Guard helicopters it ended up causing me. To have problems with my I. neck if you've never written in a helicopter you're not missing anything. I especially. Especially I think Vietnam War era. That type of helicopters should any rate. Riding in a helicopter and seeing an area called coffee park I don't know if you've all seen that the photo of this place on in Santa Rosa. This is a community of the several flower totally destroyed. By that fire up in Santa Rosa where -- We lost about Decatur nine thousand homes and about forty three lives forty four large. And so it was clear that we had a problem with our emergency alert systems they they were not working of this fire came very quickly it all sounds familiar because it is familiar. And so I was finishing up a hearing. On December fourth on these emergency alert system sent a talking about the fact we really needed to shore this whole process apart nine eleven system. Forty years old I mean basically before the internet -- Are universal alert systems well they go too far and not CPAS enough and many of you during the Thomas fire probably got that o'clock in the morning. Alert telling us to evacuate except what they're really trying to still people Carpinteria to evacuate. So our systems clearly -- Needed work so I bang the gavel down a five o'clock and said sort of bows fully well it's December hopefully our fire season is. Is pretty well behind us it'll give us a few months to really try to come to grips with this and and get moving to try to correct going forward. An hour and a half later Thomas Firestar. In December actually unheard off that we would have a fire that magnitude in December that burned for forty days and we all experience with that that created so. I have done a bill. That authorizes its SP eight twenty one it's an emergency notification bill. What we discovered and it's the same problem we're still having today in our community people do not sign up? Now granted we had some problems bingo Lita people did sign up and didn't get noticed will deal with that problem. A believing we will deal with that problem. The fact is people aren't signing up well you know you going Google in you get signed up for all sorts of stuff that you don't want to be signed up. For so how about a system where the county candidates discretion. Sign people up to get these emergency alerts by using information based upon your utility bills we know where people live and we know even if their phone numbers are reflective of a NATO five area. So that people will get notice and if they don't want to be part of it they can opt out. But it is an opt in system and dumb a I do believe that we have a lot of support on that from our public safety people you know the job to alert people is. Of the job of law enforcement and I do know that almost all our law enforcement in California supports that. I'm it was mentioned the debris flow the X. India efficient proximate cause issue. That is a Lara California but it's in it's not actually in statute it's the case law that has come down so basically. There is absolutely no doubt that Thomas fire was the cause of the debris flow. And I don't know that they're any insurance companies at this point Tom that are denying that but they're sort of hanging back a little bit from what I gather in when I was here. In January you gave me a list of those companies that were problem and they're still marked in big bold letters and reading could my notebook and I I'm going after those. Companies to pay up but this is such a bill I'm doing SP nine seventeen Skinner actually put this into statute. So that there's no way these companies can get around I'll tell you it's very interesting they're trying very hard undermining. My ability to get this bill passed -- But I am determined and then not the last item I wanted to mention was a bill SP twelve sixty the fire prevention and protection. Which I authored again in part because of the experience that we've had throughout the state in the fact that. It what they didn't mention is that currently California now has. Hundred and thirty eight billion dead trees. Which are about as flammable is anything you can imagine that in there not all up in the forest and moving California. And that its almost impossible to try to cut down all these trees but what we can do in one of the things that this bill doesn't a cheap Peterson mention it serve obliquely but we don't we haven't been doing any burns we have been doing. Any kind of controlled burns in the state because for a lot of good reasons but you know what. We gotta start doing these controlled burns and we're gonna do them as protectively as possible we've brought this bill includes your quality control districts. To to be part of this discussion but if you inhaled those fumes for forty days as many of us did this is not healthy. And we need to do better to manage our forests and that's what SP twelve sixty does using the experts you you saw some of them here with no yes you saw them locally -- Dealing with the fact that we have a wildlife urban interface we called the Wu we which is job. Different than the forests up in northern. It's a very different chaparral is different I and what we're doing is bringing together these experts to figure out a plan to try to thin the forests. To thin the area so that we don't end up. Standing there watching helplessly and with great trauma as that fire moved from Santa Paula. All the way to the back country in in Montecito in Santa Barbara we've got to do better that is part of that is the of the curse of the climate change that we're experiencing this those droughts the bark beetles to things that are destroying. Our forest destroying our chaparral and we've got to address that problem so that's SP twelve sixty the governor put a hundred and sixty million dollars into the budget this year for this long term forest health and wildlife a wildfire. Resiliency including of money for it we estimate about hundred twenty million will go for this so. The state is putting money in -- We have are working collaboratively and I think -- Yes under values. The county. Has never really experienced anything like this before but oh yes house the office of emergency services state so coming together working in the emergency management program with a with Roth. I in in the others who have dealt with some fires and we we are somewhat experienced in them here in California and it in locally but this was an event that. Was so complex. That it did that market would do choose the head of the office of emergency services who was a rock star -- It set at had worked with the Jamie Lee I. what's his name Jamie. Jamie Lee Witt who was a double also rockstar -- It's it in all the years of twenty five years that. He's been working on fires he said this is the most complex. A event he's ever experienced so bringing together this collaborative effort with the state with the feds FEMA was there for us -- We got a huge amount of money a again money is critical because if we have to take money for these fires that we could and should be using for a variety of services within this community. Up we are. Going to really be -- Unduly strapped interest. In never able to dig out of this whole I'm gonna. Let my colleague here -- Take over from here where I think we do have questions I'm I just wanna give a shout out to the staff that your we've got some sergeants here from documento. I'm gonna give a particular thanks to Fernando Ramirez who is my staff a native of Santa pollen. Who's a works for me in the capital and help put this all together. I know Monique staff has been. Working very hard in this. All of you for being here thank you thank you we will get through this it's going to be tough. But heck we're Senate Barbour county we can do anything. And likewise I want to give thanks Jimmy red rock I have any Lopez Stephanie I mean it's not that they amount of the us you know several folks who are here who have been working. On when the center and I are in Sacramento which on a regular basis every single week we do have team members who are here Who are the voice in the ears and that way we cannot be here so it thinks everyone what we'd like to do is we have set up a microphone? I'm here at the front I'm for public comment again this was the opportunity for us to bring a taste of what our Sacramento hearings are like to the local community so this is your opportunity. To get a public comment into display of record it can also be a question if we have the capacity to answer a question we may or may not. Have the capacity to answer questions and we can try to answer those questions but again this is the opportunity for you at to get anything you'd like into the legislative record. And please state your name -- First [inaudible] Thank you. My name's Toni spayed or Adams time here run to representing two different groups one so twenty three homeowners on Montecito Vista off Parker pass road. Our first question is. They are related to that county and how. And to get our first responders to live in that community because there's fear with the road closure so many of our first responders live outside of the area. Our second concern is that we attended M. wanna see a Planning Commission a board of supervisors hearing. Joe Cole who's here with us today and chief Heckman we heard their professional consultants report about back burning house for senator Jackson. And thank you for Senate bill twelve sixty however at that hearing there was agreement on a recommendation that sounds are had not been a fire since nineteen thirty three there should be back burning. And there were countless environmentalists to them one to the board of supervisors they don't live among aceto and then where the sufferers. So our our concern is that while we appreciate twelve sixty we have the benefit of that expertise from professionals on a paid consulting report. We lack governance seed also are planning commission listen to our chief but then nothing happened and Nash you see we had a major fire so one of our concerns as legislatures. How do we prevent that from happening again where our local area says we need back burning we have a paid fire department? But then as it goes up the latter were put into peril I speak to you in our neighborhood we been through three fires in nine years evacuated three times. Huge cost to families resulting and Boris says. Children that are adversely affected and we we welcome of legislation to prevent it our other question is we'd like to see legislation so that when donors gave money we have several neighbors are willing to give so significant amounts. And did but the donations somehow went into a black hole we would like to see the local giving stay local so that there Tom accountability and transparency. We have neighbors in my community very concerned that doctors nurses lawyers teachers who were adversely affected by that much slow needed to get the boulders removed. People were willing to give but they do know where their money went so if there's anything you can do. For the in the area of transparency local donors some of the money went to Santa Barbara City College for someone to United Way red cross. And then people stop giving who were willing to give more to help families but there was no accountability are transparent parents C.. And then our last question was how will pending legislation help the people in this room. We understand going forward you have great ideas. That at the extension are temporary living expenses what have you. But under contract lower understanding from meeting with independent insurance adjusters and with attorneys. It it then senator Jackson you know this best ping an attorney which I'm not. You can't go retroactive it would be going forward people in this room are concerned and we found that all different insurance companies such all different contracts. But again to to help our community he'll we'd like to see. Something it where not might not be possible to help them and if we can't. Be retroactive then again through donations or we can ensure that the people who lived here before the debris flow on the fire. Can return to our community and then our goal is to make sure that our first responders live on this side of wherever disrobe closure may be. So that when something happens we can have all those firefighters nurses doctors whoever we need law enforcement officers. In our community thank you for your time. Well let let me try to answer. That was a lot of very good questions. Our first responders living on in on the side of the hill that's a housing issue that's a real challenge. What we did here was the pre positioning so you get this red flag alert and I remember Friday evening I was headed toward carbon via? And saw all these -- Yes trucks -- Trucks from long fire trucks who had pre positioned here so arm onto the housing issue is sort of a battle on its own -- But certainly it would be very helpful to people were able to leave here but that's an issue that. Thing is going to take a bunch of time to to Richard I just want to add all the vacant house in Samana C. alike to my neighborhood there's six on my street all the people said they would offer their homes for first responders to make sure they could stay. Here because we know hotels become commodity were Woodland Hills were deployed to but maybe we could have a central place for people who have three four eight bedroom homes. They were willing to make them available what we didn't know who to call what to do so that's just the point perhaps the county can have of something. Available to it in terms of short term or term housing for first first. As far as donors -- That's a challenge I know United Way red cross they accept contributions a the goal for all the services so probably the money that was spent putting in some of these facilities here was money that others had given previously. Are I think there can be instances where nonprofits are set up locally for very specific purposes they just have to create them. And the last thing -- With the the controlled burns and all up my my measure I. is designed -- To basically prioritize I and this will allow cal fire to the to prioritize based on risk reduction. And that's part of what this is going to be they'll up work with all stakeholders to plan the fuel reduction in the least impactful way -- Including the impact of the environment but the bottom line is -- The choices are between a controlled small burn or an uncontrolled big wildfire and obviously we have got to go for the former. Rather than the latter that's the reason I've done the bill and I think that. I think we all recognize again with the nature of these fires we've gotta do more controlled burns. But at and intelligently so that's my hope. The the you know and we agree I think that they a couple things that I'd like to add in terms of the housing situation by there are temporary things that we can do for short term in and on mid term. Housing options for first responders on this November I. California will see a couple ballot initiatives that deal with housing and on if it is the hope of this community to see a long term solution. When local communities whether it county or city are developing housing plans and have housing initiatives and I would highly suggest that that voice be? A voice that's out there we talk about affordable housing housing for veterans on and if housing for first responders is something the community wants we may have that opportunity to think about this in the long term. While we experienced it on fire and for the debris flows it's not the first time we've experienced it we also experienced it for the la Conchita mudslides. On and we have we have consistently seemed at first responders among also on education for you know professionals -- Health professionals I'm are not living in the communities where they work and this is one of the long term consequences of individuals who cannot afford to live in the community C. work. Out so I will say that we will have an as community the opportunity to address this if we go to our cities and also. To our counties and when housing projects are being built and ask is there an opportunity to include. XML units in this particular project for first responders with considered work for housing and so I will add that and I think that that's something that we can definitely. Of as well in the future -- In terms of that as someone M. who chairs the select committee for the nonprofit sector there's definitely room to keep having conversations about donations and how we keep donations local. And how we ensure that there's a network I'm that is able to provide information at to our local community that were local donations are going. Out I I just wanted to add those pieces. I don't have anyone in the county wants. I'll go on to the next question or comment and I think we can win here and then. My name is Cindy Marcus and I want to address your issue of people signing up for the aware and prepare I am signed up for all of them and I was getting. Loads of alerts and but there was no phone service a land line service no cellphone service. And I was dependent on that I I was waiting for the alert you to know what to do and once the phone service one out there was no alert we have. Power we admit. No nothing so is there something to do in that certain so -- Yes -- And part of this hearing that I was doing in December fourth was to address the fact that our wireless services do nothing. Or very little -- They've got to of be -- Present in this discussion because Vera fewer and fewer people are having landline And right and so. I mean land lines we're working Or people were getting notices that were not accurate -- We need to do we need to create a twenty first century technologically appropriate warning system back in the old days the warning was the church bells. We don't have that anymore but we do have technology that should be as effective if not more effective there's G. O. fencing that they're talking about now. There's also to G. P. S. type our options are but the private sector the profit driven private sector is not particularly interested in this -- We've got to get their interest and we're trying to work on that Yes. First a comment then some comments and questions George Bush New Orleans. Hannah Beth Jackson. Toni Collette mon and dos Williams minus ito. Elections make a difference. And I thank you all for your participation. My first question is monitoring equipment was mentioned. Of being stalled. I'm curious what so. We're just John that is I do not think this is the appropriate time and place for that since it. Sounds like it might be quite extensive. But I'm hoping that you could schedule a hearing in the appropriate humanities. So the public comment like me with wacky ideas -- Can come portion present my wacko ideas -- For example like you know the oil separation. How could be done by centrifugal force rather than? You know nowadays that don't work -- Second of all -- I've heard a lot about property owners and government but I have not heard anything about mentors. I am a member of the rental housing mediation board for the city's Santa Barbara. What's going on with matters you how are they being assisted what's what's going on with that. Here's my wacko idea. I watch the planes. Go into the lake and it. Scoop up water. Golden fire scene and dump it. It seemed to be a little more ineffective me trying to put out the fire in my fireplace by spitting on it. What I'm thinking is would it not be cheaper? To have along -- To even though it's five miles long they could deliver fire hydrant force in volume -- That local. No household water supplies Cannot. So I lay that I mean. Boy those guys sure could use a lot of water at the scene of the fire and I think it could make a significant difference. If we could transfer the water that's in the lake. To the fire expeditiously. Thanks thank you end it you know the month this subgroup the Montecito -- Group whose name I the resiliency committee I'm sure would be delighted to hear some of your comments well that's it I mean it's just a brainstorm and have no qualifications to back up. Other than being wacko -- We we C. idea. I think you and I do wanna say M. I am referencing the document we have about all the bills that were introduced in one of those bills that was introduced by a colleague in the assembly is only member would. I'm was AB nineteen ninety and the bill prohibits price gouging of the rental housing that was not on the market at the time of the proclamation our declaration of emergency. And so currently the like this for up property that was on the market I'm during that time and so this is an expansion I'm of of protection for renters so I wanted to mention that that bill is currently in Senate appropriations so it's still alive. Well I. encourage you to encourage staff to contact the rental housing mediation board Mr Fano. And on safe you can coordinate you get some kind of notice put on your publications that this is a service that is available. And encouraged us willing to put the county on the contract. My name is Lawrence Thompson. Our local architect. And since it I. two thousand thirteen I've been in liaison with county fire on the idea. Of putting a fire helicopter operation. Right near Marcy. To because we have over a hundred miles between sanity and as and the Ventura county operations. And it takes them typically over half an hour with their ten and it -- Launch time. To get down here. Whereas we have put together an operation. That would launch in four minutes Andy probably anywhere in Lara Seto wasn't within ten maybe even eight minutes. The difference of course is light years in terms of fire growth obviously with the Tom aspire being so well developed it wouldn't. Make much difference other than augmenting the Hartford. But as with the recent holiday fire. And other fires that are do the Sundowners which need immediate response it would make a terrific difference the problem we're having is. Money. The county does not have the money. And I understand that in course even the fire departments who are operate tremendous effort -- They need more money just to do what they're doing now. Yeah so this is the problem I have one individual who would. Come up with a half a million dollars cash to reduce one point eight million dollar your project -- But I'd have to match to get him to bring that money and the question is. Is there anything such at the state level. Is there anything in terms of the insurance companies who have contacted. Who could join together? To help augment this we have how many. Hundred billion dollars for the real estate here. And yet we have the RP helicopters in Santa Ynez. That's it's very responsible we have a big county in there right in the middle. But as with the Josh hasn't seen a fire. They weren't in the Bates at that time. And by the time the helicopters got there the wind was too strong they couldn't do anything. But the response time was like ninety minutes. That's a light here. So. Might Mike frustration is even though a she Peterson's Gimme a kind letter. I. supporting this says. Are there other agencies out of the county. The Cannella bog Neptis. And bring us to a point where the the enormous of preponderance of work of worth in terms of property exists Thank you. At you know I I look at our fire folks and in the back and and welcome them if they want to respond I do you want to describe a little bit about how state funding works and when we've been able to share with you have. Some additional funding that has been brought by the state and we have worked with the county to identify the priorities -- We work with cities with counties with our municipalities to identify what the priorities are. And certainly our request being greater than what we've been able to and bring to you but and this does become a challenge for us that. We are looking at where we are where we are at M. also the direction that being given to us on at the local level as well in terms of what those priorities are. If that was something that was a priority for the county F. or the city it does mean there's tradeoffs there is nothing that is done without trade offs. On we would you know welcome to how that conversation on a but that is something that we would have to that really work with the county and the cities to understand where does the following terms of the priority. It has been made clear to espy at I think our local municipalities at their priorities at this moment is -- Immediate recovery -- Long term or mid term planning Is something that we're trying to get to Beth are are communities have made it very clear that some of the backfill on related to so much that has been lost here is is the immediate priority. I'm I don't know if anyone. I eight think that this is where we're at certainly I'm if there are agencies whether it's a public private private partnerships that are willing to explore a and we would be happy to think about that. Bombing connect those agencies should we identify them. Yeah I think these were all very excellent suggestions if we have people who are willing to contribute but they want to make sure the money is going. Where they wanted to go in We again. The whole notion of public private partnerships is where we have to go both statewide in federally it's the you know it's the public -- Trough gets less and less on the federal level because of all these tax giveaways the reduction of the ability of our federal government to provide services is only going to increase. Of the state has had a pretty good run recently but the economy. What goes up will come down so if there are some suggestions and then again coordinating with our -- First responders they know best what is the most efficient use of those dollars. Conversation absolutely worth having. We had this one woman here who. Was wanted to come on up don't don't be shy. My name is Lee M. Palmer I'm actually a good leader resonant First I'd like to think. Wanders for Friday night. Was not anything like this but it wasn't [inaudible] Good -- In a poll of over fifty of my neighbors on the neighborhood. Out in the area directly affected I was well as co workers that live all over town. We did not receive any alerts we were all signed up. Now that one change that has happened. Since we all signed up for these things. Is the eight oh five issue. I wonder if anyone has investigated with however that worked because when I signed back up as it all my neighbors after we got done evacuated and coming back home and I know it was small. Compared to what money Seto went through but it could have been worse. I wonder if anyone has investigated if Scott affected us because the only thing that came through to me was news hawk. And I got air every single. Surveying over this fired the Whittier fire everywhere so I wonder about that. And the second comment I have is. I'm old enough to remember and most people in this room. The emergency broadcast system test. With the obnoxious noise that used to come over the TV. Has anyone ever considered. Before we have the next disaster to test. The reverse. Nine one one the Nick sleep. The Santa Barbara county. Do a test notify everybody we're going to do a test. And see what happens because you don't find the holes until the people are scrambling around in the dark. Trying to figure out what happened. So since you are on that committee maybe we can implement this and maybe if we have another just faster. Our community will get timely notice. Thank you is shy -- Pulled out the article -- The Tyler Hayden wrote a I guess it was yesterday -- Very distressing -- And I'm sure the county is going to take a very deep dive into that and I will as well Because there's really. Not no excuse for for that fortunately no one was killed. Arm the sheriff's office to go door to door which I think helped. Did not go to your door. Well I have friends that live on north Fairview in an area I lost. Friends who lost their homes. Nobody went door to door people fled. Well I think there was no way for them to get up there to go door to door the immediate neighborhood south. Of cathedral oaks there were no deputies going door to door they were doing the best they can. They can't go door to door that. Well I I think that we will be taking a very hard look at this I think your suggestion has merit to it as well. We do have the technology today we just have to apply it and I think those who are very good questions and thank you for that thank you. Any last questions [inaudible] Rundown. Hello my name is Jeff harms Simon twelve forty seven east Holly wrote. I'm landscape architect -- I have a question regarding forest management -- I think that it's something that actually. Hit some a lot of these points here and I think it's really important -- Well my question is is what kind of management are we going to go forward with. You no we started off with Mike Smokey the bear management we all come to know that didn't work. And now we're going to the you know the weed Wacker thing we're removing everything from the forest. But there are more modern ways of doing in worried too rewilding things and they actually proven to work better. My question is how are we presenting that rather than having a knee jerk reaction as to what we're going to do. I Wilk presenting that as let's go forward with the modern way of doing things of the better progressive way of doing things to make things actually work. And is that part of the legislation thank. A I think you for the question and that is actually the bill that I am I am authoring EP. Nineteen fifty six and it's the year around per I. fire prevention acts M. that cal fire chief alluded to and it does bring -- Experts I'm from academia to industry to at first responders to a space to have those conversations I'm not just in terms of what the best practices are in California but looking at it I'm from the world what have we seen in other areas of the world where. And whether it's a wildfire or and flood or anything of the kind what what are the types.
