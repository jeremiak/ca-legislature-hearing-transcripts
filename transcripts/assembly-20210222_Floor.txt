SMALL BUSINESSES ALLOW INDIVIDUALS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE TO HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES THAT SUPPLY JOBS TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND ALSO. ENTREPRENEURSHIP MEMBERS I WONDER.

I AM PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS MEASURE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. DEMONSTRATION THE SERVER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FROM YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON JOBS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE ECONOMY I RISE IN SUPPORT TODAY SB EIGHTY SEVEN SINCE MARCH OF LAST YEAR WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY HEARD FROM OUR SMALL SIZE BUSINESSES THAT HAD THE MOST ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE FROM THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THAT IT HAS BEEN TOO EXTREME FOR THEM TO BREAK EVEN TO TAKE ON DEBT AND ZERO INTEREST LOANS I WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION MISTER SPEAKER AND HIS STAFF AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET CHAIR AND BUDGET COMMITTEE AND ESPECIALLY BUDGET SUB FOR CHAIR MY FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES. FOR THEIR OPENNESS TO WORK WITH THE SIMPLY COMMITTEE AND TAKING THIS IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN ADDRESSING REAL CHALLENGES FACING OUR ECONOMY SB EIGHTY SEVEN MAKES PRACTICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE GRANT PROGRAM WHILE ALSO STRENGTHENING THE OUT REACH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS LET ME JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE FROM SB EIGHTY SEVEN. IT CODIFIES THE PROGRAM WHICH MEANS THAT RELATED FISCAL AS WELL AS POLICY COMMITTEES CAN HOLD THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTABLE TO MEETING ITS TRUE PURPOSE IT INCLUDES BOTH GENERAL REQUIREMENTS ON COLLABORATING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS SETTING SPECIFIC OUTREACH MANDATES INCLUDING REQUIRING THAT OUT REACH AND SERVICE GAPS B. ASSESSED BY EACH FUNDING ROUND. SO THAT ARE REACHED A CAN BE A SO ADDRESS I'VE MET TO THE IMPROVE PROGRAM ACT. IT ALSO REQUIRES EACH NEW FUNDING BE. PROCESS APPROVED TO BY LEAST THREE WEEKS. THREE WEEKS OF OUT REJECT. TO OUR SMALL DOES AND NON. AND IT SETS. GROUP THE- AND- ON A WAR IN A REPORT TO THE LIE. I LIKE MANY OF MY CAR. WORKED OR THE CHRIS HOLIDAY TO ENSURE THE SMALL. AND NONPROFITS IN MY- LEARNED ABOUT THE PROBE. HOW TO APPLY AND WHAT RESOURCE WERE AVAILABLE TO THEM. I CO HOST THREE TECH ASSIST WEBER. AND WORK WITH MY DISTRICT TO DIRECTLY CON OVER THREE HUNDRED SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS TO ALERT THEM AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY. THIS PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT AND WITH THESE ADDITIONAL MONIES MORE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT. WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESSES SURVIVE THIS PANDEMIC AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER VENTES. MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. YES THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY SEVEN- A BIPARTISAN MEASURE AND I BUT I THINK- AS WE AS WE STAND HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT AND I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. WE SHOULD ALSO LAMENT THE FACT THAT THIS BILL THAT HAVE TO BE AS BIG. AS IT IS TODAY TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THE HURT AND HARM THAT WE DID TO OUR SMALL BUSINESS DID NOT HAVE TO BE. AS IMPACTFUL AS IT WAS. AND IT WAS SO BECAUSE OF ONE REASON ONE MAN RULE. IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS TIERED SYSTEM THAT RIGHT NOW TODAY AS WE STAND HERE TODAY STILL KEEPS SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED. WHILE BIG BUSINESS IS ALLOWED TO OPERATE WHILE LOWE'S AND HOME DEPOT OR OPEN. OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ARE CLOSE NOT BECAUSE OF ANYTHING THAT YOU PASSED. NOT BECAUSE OF ANYTHING THAT YOU HAD ANY INPUT ON. BUT BECAUSE THIS GOVERNOR ARBITRARILY AND UNILATERALLY DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN MOSTLY SMALL BUSINESS IN THE STATE. AND AS A RESULT MANY BUSINESSES HAVE ALREADY GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. AND THAT SHOULD BE A PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE OF US. WHILE OTHER STATES THEIR SMALL BUSINESSES I MADE IT THROUGH THIS AND MUCH BETTER NUMBERS THAN OURS OURS HAVE LANGUISHED. AND LITERALLY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS HAD TO LAY OFF ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES. THE HARDEST THING THAT THEY EVER HAD TO DO. ONLY TO BE TURNED OVER TO AN EIGHTY D. THEY DID NOT SUPPORT THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND GET THEM ON BACKLOG. SO IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT HOW WE LOVE SMALL BUSINESS AND WE'RE GOING TO SEND THEM TWENTY ONE BILLION. TODAY BUT WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT NEVER AGAIN. TO ALLOW ONE MAN. TO MAKE LL THE DECISIONS AND TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S DUE PROCESS AND THEIR AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS. THEIR VERY LIVELIHOODS TO MAKE A LIVING. SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE SHOULD COMMIT OURSELVES TO NEVER LETTING THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. AND WE SHOULD ALSO COMMIT OURSELVES IF YOU SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS STOP REGULATING THEM INTO OBLIVION. IN THE STATE AND PASSING FEE AFTER FEE AND REGULATION AFTER REGULATION ON TOP OF THEM MAKE IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR THEM. TO SURVIVE IN THE STATE'S SMALL BUSINESSES THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY. BUT WE NEED TO SHOW IT WITH THE POLICIES THAT GET PASSED IN THIS BUILDING AND BY STANDING UP AGAINST THIS GOVERNOR. WHO IS IT WHO IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN DEFICIT IN THE STATE AND THE REASON WHY WE HAVE TO PASS THIS BILL TODAY. TO SEND THEM RELIEF. AND SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE AND ALSO FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THE FUTURE TO STOP THESE ABUSES FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN LET'S SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ALL THE TIME. THANK YOU. MISS PETER NORRIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY I IT'S A PROUD CO AUTHOR AND S. B. EIGHTY SEVEN AS OTHERS HAVE SAID CALIFORNIA IS A SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE HEART AND SOUL OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY THEY ARE ALSO THE HEART AND SOUL OF SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THE REALITY IS THAT THE COVETED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES HAVE CLOSED THEIR DOORS PERMANENTLY AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE ARE TEETERING ON THE BRINK RIGHT NOW OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE DYING AND WE SIMPLY CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. IS WHEN A SMALL BUSINESS DIES IT'S NOT JUST ONE DREAM THAT DIES. IT'S NOT JUST ONE PERSON IT'S AN ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESSES EMPLOY MORE THAN TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND SO I AM SO PLEASED TODAY THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS STEP WITH SB EIGHTY SEVEN TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF AT THIS CRITICAL POINT AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THIS GRANT PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE A LIFELINE OF SUPPRT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ALL ACROSS THE STATE I SAW THAT WE CAN STABILIZE OUR SMALL BUSINESS AND GET TO THE WORK OF REBUILDING CALIFORNIA AND REBUILDING OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS PETRI NORRIS MISSED ONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY SEVEN. WHAT I'M HEARING TODAY IS A LOT OF BIPARTISAN EFFORTS. AND THAT THIS BILL IS GOOD A VERY GOOD BILL AND A RIGHT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE OF BIPARTISAN. WHAT I'M ASKING YOU THOUGH IS I HOPE WE CONTINUE THAT IN THAT SPIRIT. AS WE LOOK INTO HOW WE CAN ALLOW THE SMALL BUSINESS TO FULLY REOPEN. THEY NEED MORE THAN JUST THESE FINDINGS TO HELP THEM THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO RE OPEN FULLY SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY. AND THEIR EMPLOYEES WHO THEN CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY. THIS IS COULD BE VERY HELPFUL NO DOUBT. AND IN MY DISTRICT THESE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSAND OF THEM. NEED THESE FUNDING BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO BE REOPENED FULLY. SOME ASKING YOU HERE TODAY TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IS TO WORK IN A BIPARTISAN EFFORT. TO ALLOW THESE BUSINESS MALL BUSINESS WHICH HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT. THAT WILL PERMANENTLY CLOSE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. ALLOW THEM TO FULLY RE OPEN. GIVEN THE GUIDELINES THE SAFETY GUIDELINES AND THE PROTOCOLS THAT THEY NEED TO I HEREBY. AND THEY WILL DO IT THEY HAVE DONE IT. BUT THEY CANNOT CONTINUE IN WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THE DIRECTION WE ARE TODAY. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR AUTHORED FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN.

INCLUDING ADDITIONAL TIME FOR MEANINGFUL OUTREACH PROGRAMS WILL ENSURE THAT ALL SMALL BUSINESSES WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM NOT JUST THOSE ALREADY CONNECTED WITH SMALL BUSINESS GROUPS OR ASSOCIATIONS OR LOCAL CHAMBERS OR THOSE WHO ARE TECH SAVVY AND CAN NAVIGATE COMPLICATED DIGITAL SYSTEMS. THE ADDITIONAL REPORTING PROVISIONS WILL PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO THIS PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE HELPING BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. BY THE PANDEMIC WE CAN TALK ABOUT EQUITY OR WE CAN ACTUALLY CREATE THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE IT AND WE ARE DOING JUST THAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK ISABELLE GOOSE MON FROM THE OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE AND WISH HER LUCK IN HER NEW ROLE IN WASHINGTON DC WHILE IT IS A LOSS TO OUR STATE. IT IS A WIN FOR OUR NATION WHO WILL HAVE A CALIFORNIA CHAMPION ON THEIR SIDE I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS THE STAFF MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AS WELL AS OUR CHAIRMAN MR TANG FROM SAN FRANCISCO IN OUR SPEAKER AND LEADERSHIP IN GENERAL FOR ENSURING THAT US WE TRIED TO.
