WHICH SIX THE STORE ONLY ON TO BE HEARD -- ISSUE NUMBER ONE HOUSING FIRST PEARLY PROGRAMS THING UP GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M GINNY PUDDY FOOT EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. AND WITH ME IS STEPHANIE WELCH WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL JUSTICE. AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNCIL AND STEPHANIE IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU IS THE RESULT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH THE HOME WAS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. AND WITH THE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP. WHICH HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING WITH STATE DEPARTMENTS TO ASSESS THEIR PROGRAMS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING FIRST. BY THE JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STATUTORY DEADLINE. THE PURPOSE OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS TO RECONCILE TWO IMPORTANT POLICY GOALS. ADDRESSING THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS AND ADDRESSING THE CRISIS OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. WE KNOW THAT BEST PRACTICE FOR TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IS THE ADOPTION OF HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLES. WE ALSO KNOW THAT BEST PRACTICE TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. IS A CONTINUUM OF TREATMENT OPTIONS FROM DETOX AND INTENSE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS. TO OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE OPTION OF LIVING IN APPEARS SUPPORTED SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENT. THE DECISION AS TO WHERE ON THE CONTINUE OF TREATMENT OPTIONS A PERSON SHOULD BE PLACED. IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE MADE BY THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS OR HER CLINICIAN. CURRENTLY THE HOUSING FIRST STATUTE DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS RECOVERY HOUSING WHICH INCLUDES SOBER LIVING FACILITIES. AND REQUIRES THE TENANT SELECTION PROCESSES ACCEPT APPLICANTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR SOBRIETY YOUR USE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS. AND ALSO REQUIRES THE USE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS NOT BE AN IMMEDIATE REASON FOR EVICTION. BY DEFINITION RECOVERY HOUSING REQUIRES ADHERENCE TO SOBRIETY AS A CORE COMPONENT OF TREATMENT. IN SEEKING GUIDANCE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE THE COUNCIL CONSULTED WITH AN EXPERT IN HOMELESSNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. AND REVIEWED POLICY GUIDANCE FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT OR HUD. HOW TECHNOLOGY IS THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH HOUSING FIRST AND RECOVERY HOUSING? AND SUGGEST THAT IF RECOVERY HOUSING ADOPT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IT CAN BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLES AND AN APPROPRIATE CHOICE. FOR PEOPLE SEEKING TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO RECONCILE THESE TWO POLICY GOALS TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO MAINTAIN CHOICE ALONG WITH ENSURING. ACCESS TO TREATMENT OPTIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF HOUSING FIRST. IT SPECIFIES THAT RECOVERY HOUSING MUST COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO ALSO BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH HOUSING FIRST. ONE UNLESS MANDATED BY THE COURT OR CONDITION OF PAROLE. PARTICIPATION IN A SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENT MUST BE VOLUNTARY. TWO THERE MUST BE MINIMUM BARRIERS TO ENTRY SO THAT LONG PERIODS OF SOBRIETY CLEAN CRIMINAL RECORDS OR CLEAR EVICTION HISTORIES ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR PROGRAM ENTRY. THREE THE PROGRAM MUST INCLUDE RELAPSE SUPPORT THE DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY IF VICTOR JUST CHARGE A PROGRAM PARTICIPANT FOR TEMPORARY LAPSE BUT THAT ALSO ALLOWS FOR MOVEMENT OF A PARTICIPANT INTO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE IS APPROPRIATE. AND FOR PARTICIPANTS WHO DETERMINED THEY ARE NO LONGER INTERESTED IN LIVING. IN A HOUSING SETTING WITH AN ABSTINENCE FOCUS OR WHO ARE JUST CHARGER EVICTED FROM THE PROGRAM MUST BE OFFERED ASSISTANCE IN FINDING ALTERNATIVE HOUSING. INCLUDING HOUSING WITH A HOUSING FIRST HARM REDUCTION APPROACH. IN OUR VIEW ADOPTION THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE INSURERS THAT PROGRAMS FUNDED IMPLEMENTED OR ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE. CAN COMPLY WITH THE JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STATUTORY DEADLINE FOR ADOPTING HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLES. AND ALSO ALLOW THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO BEST PRACTICES FOR TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WHILE MAINTAINING INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. AS TO WHETHER A SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENT IS THE BEST OPTION FOR THEM IN THEIR RECOVERY. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WITH MY COLLEAGUES STEPHANIE WELCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. A QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE MR. YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST I KNOW THIS ITEM IS TO BE HELD OPEN BUT I JUST WANNA STAY MY PERSPECTIVE ON IT. WHICH IS PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE A SURPRISE IS THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE -- I BELIEVE AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE STOOD FOR THE PRINCIPLE THAT HOUSING FIRST IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY AND AN IN HOMELESSNESS. AND I SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT I KNOW BEEN RAISED BY OTHERS THAT THE CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. COULD AND LIKELY WILL DISADVANTAGED THOSE AND RECOVERY AN INCREASE HOMELESSNESS  KNOW THAT CITY SEE OUR NEW THAT THIS POLICY APPLIED WHEN SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ITEMS THAT WE DO THINK SHOULD BE CELEBRATED IN A POLICY COMMITTEE RATHER THAN HERE SO IF I TO VOTE ON IT TODAY I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT -- JUST WANNA SAY THAT AS THIS CONTINUES ON IN THE DELIBERATIONS AND THERE YOU GO. AT MY PERSPECTIVES PROBABLY NOT A SURPRISE. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND BECAUSE IDEALLY WE WOULD WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY HAVE PREFERRED TO TAKE THIS TO THE POLICY COMMITTEE. ON THIS ISSUE ACTUALLY DID NOT REALLY COME TO LIGHT UNTIL LATE MARCH -- WHEN THE WORKING GROUP REALLY HAS BEEN TURNING FROM ONE DEPARTMENT TO ANOTHER IN OUR DELIBERATIONS AND ASSISTANCE WITH DEPARTMENTS? AND AT THAT POINT WE WE FLAG IT AND TOOK IT TO THE HOMELESS COURTING IN FINANCING COUNCIL IN OUR APRIL MEETING -- AND WE WE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SUFFICIENT TIME TO BRING IT TO THE POLICY COMMITTEE AS WE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO TORONTO INTO THE APARTMENT NO WHEN. CENTER MITCHELL'S BILL PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT THIS WAS GOING TO POWER I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THAT I COULD COUNT APARTMENT A FINANCE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT AWARE THAT THIS WITH BILL WITH APPLY TO THEM AND THEREFORE THIS IS PART OF THE REASON. FOR THE NEED WHEN THIS ISSUE CAME UP IN LATE MARCH BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE -- YOU KNOW POSSIBLY TO A FAX EITHER IT'S GOING TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PRO IS A COUNTRY WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS OR THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT. CAN -- BUDGET IMPACT TO TREAT MORE FOLKS UNDER THE HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLE SO -- THEY WEREN'T AWARE AND I THINK IT'S AN INTERPRETATION OF THE LANGUAGE AFTER THAT THE THE FACT THAT'S DRIVING THE NEED FOR THIS CHANGE WHY YES AND WE'RE STILL LEFT WITH THE POLICY CONVERSATIONS SO HAPPENING GAUGE WITH. YOU GUYS ON THIS AS THIS ITEM IS HELD OPEN BUT JUST WANT TO SAY THAT SO THERE'S NO SURPRISES. THANK YOU. A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- NUMBER ONE IS TIME SENSITIVE. IT IS VERY TIME SENSITIVE -- THE SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY REQUIRES THAT STATE DEPARTMENTS COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF HOUSING FIRST. BY JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND AS THE COUNCIL WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT COMPLIANCE. AND WHAT OTHER GROUPS WILL THIS AFFECT. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT -- AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I DO REPRESENT CDC ARE -- ON THE COMMERCE COURT NAME FINANCING COUNCIL AND SO I CAN -- SUPPORT THAT -- WE WERE UNAWARE THAT ARE TREATMENT PROGRAMS WOULD FALL UNDERNEATH THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT AND INTO IT UNTIL LATE MARCH AND SO -- BUT AT AS A ARE MY COUNSEL ACTUALLY TRIES TO TO ADVOCATE FOR POLICIES THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOTH SUBSTANCE USE A MENTAL ILLNESS AS WELL AS FORMER INCARCERATION. SO THERE ARE POTENTIALLY OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTSIT'S NOT NECESSARILY A CDC ARE ISSUE THAT DO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXITING INCARCERATION. TO RECEIVE TREATMENT SERVICES FOR THEIR SUBSTANCE USE NEED SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS POTENTIALLY GRANTS THAT ARE OPERATED THROUGH THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. AS WELL AS SOME OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPERATED -- THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS MIGHT -- BE IMPACTED BY THIS IN THAT THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE AN OFFER SOBER LIVING AS A CHOICE AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD NO LONGER HAVE SOBER LIVING AS A CHOICE. WHAT WAS THE UNIVERSE WERE TALKING HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS? WE HAVE AN IDEA -- WE HAD A NO SO -- ACTUALLY WE WE COULD HAVE THE DEPARTMENT A MEMBER OF UP HERE BUT I THINK ROUGHLY OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. THEIR TREATMENT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE A HOUSING ELEMENT -- SERVE ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND PAROLEES SO -- WHAT'S THE QUICK MATH ON THAT LIKE SIX OR FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND PAROLEES PER YEAR COULD BE IMPACTED I MEAN IT WOULD BE SOME SUBSET OF THAT BECAUSE THEY COULD STILL PROVIDE TREATMENT SERVICES. AND HOUSING IT'S JUST THAT WOULD BE HAVE TO BE DONE IN A DIFFERENT FASHION THAT HOUSING WOULD HAVE TO BE EXTENDED. SO THEN YOU'RE DO YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SLOTS PROBABLY TO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF PROGRAM SO I JUST WANNA CONFIRM HE SAID ABOUT. FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND YES THERE'S ABSOLUTE HERE. A YEAR SO TALK ABOUT FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR INSTEAD OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. THE LEGISLATURE SAID RESOUNDINGLY. WE WANT TO CRIMINALIZE A LOT OF THINGS DRUGS AND OR ALCOHOL THE HARDEST THINGS TO GET OFF OF NO MATTER IF YOU'VE GOT A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND I USE JOE BLOW. IT IS TOUGH SPECIAL ALCOHOLISM BUT THE EFFECT OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IT IS HARD TO KICK THE STATE DOES NOT OFFER ENOUGH PROGRAMS. IN THE LEGISLATURE'S IS ETHICAL BILLION IS FOR FOLKS TO GET THEMSELVES PLAYING THAT'S A HARD THING TO DO. WE NEED THE RESOURCES. WE DON'T WANT FOLKS IN STATE PRISON LEGISLATURE WE UP HERE SAID THAT WE VOTE ON THOSE BILLS. SO AT SOME POINT IS WATER COMING BACK OUT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DEGREE OF SUCCESS. THIS IS THE INTEGRAL PART IN STARTING THAT SO. AG SAID IT'S IT'S FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE PER YEAR. OUT OF THE STATE OF FORTY MILLION SO. HOPEFULLY THE PEOPLE GET. IT TOGETHER AND WE SEE THAT YOU MAY NEED OR THEY DON'T COME BACK. SO FOR ME IT'S IT'S KIND OF A A SMALL PRICE TO PAY. WHERE WERE HELPING WITH THAT LIKE I SAID IF YOU LOOK BACK THE LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED? THE NO ONE ELSE IN PRISON THE JAILS AND I WANT TO PASS ANY LAWS THE LEGISLATURE WAS SPEAKING. THAT -- ENHANCED PENALTIES OR SINCE ANYBODY BACK [inaudible] TO PRISON [inaudible] SO. IT'S IN ALL OF THESE FOLKS ARE SOME OF OUR MOST AT RISK. AND THEY HAVE A HIGH CHANCE OF RE OFFENDING SO I WOULD SAY ON THE WRIST KILL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THEY'RE PROBABLY HIGHER THAN SOMEONE THAT'S JUST STRAIGHT HOMELESSNESS. SO I THINK THAT THE RISK TO THE PUBLIC. IS GREATLY. INCREASE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE PROPER TREATMENT. I THINK THIS LEGAL LONG WAY IN AND GETTING THEM BACK ON THE RIGHT PATH SO THIS IS SOMETHING GET BEHIND. AND SUPPORT -- AND OVERALL VOTING ON THIS WILL HOLD OPEN TODAY -- BUT YOU GOTTA TAKE A REALLY DEEP LOOK AT INSIDE IN A LIQUID LEGISLATURE'S MAN IS BAD I'VE BEEN HERE FIVE YEARS. AND THAT'S BEEN THE MANDATE. SO WE CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. I THINK THE ONE THING THAT IF YOU WOULD -- GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY WE DO A LOT OF WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY AND WHY IT WAS SO VOCAL ON THE COUNCIL. IS THAT IT'S INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES WHO ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED WHO CAME TO US AND SAID WE WANT THE CHOICE OF SOBER LIVING WE WANT THAT CHOICE -- AND I JUST DON'T WANT AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO POTENTIALLY. INADVERTENTLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY TAKE THAT OPTION AWAY FROM PEOPLE -- AND I KNOW THAT IF IF THERE WERE OTHER INDIVIDUALS HERE TODAY WHO WERE -- FORMALLY INCARCERATED THEY MIGHT SHARE THEIR STORIES ABOUT HOW FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DURING THAT IMMEDIATE TRANSITION HOME FROM PRISON. THAT BEING ABLE -- TO BE IN A SOBER ENVIRONMENT WAS REALLY CRITICAL TO THEIR REINTEGRATION AND THEIR RE ENTRY [inaudible] THE IF I COULD JUST ASK A QUESTION ON THIS POINT SO I GET THAT THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO LIVE IN SEVERAL LIVING FACILITIES BUT YOU'RE DEFINING RECOVERY HOUSING. AS SOBER LIVING FACILITIES ARE NOT GIVEN AN OPTION INDIVIDUALS WERE STRUGGLING. WITH ADDICTIONS WHO DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE STREET TO HAVE THAT OPTION AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HERE. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION WHAT THE THE THE WAY YOU THE WAY THE WAY THE LANGUAGES DEFINING RECOVERY HOUSING IT ONLY INCLUDES. SEVERAL LIVING FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE HOUSING IN AN ABSTINENCE FOCUSED IN PEER SUPPORT  COMMUNITY SO THERE IS NO OTHER POSSIBILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF FACILITIES. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING. AS YOU SAID THERE MIGHT BE SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO CHOOSE TO BE IN A SOBER LIVING FACILITIES BUT OTHERS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ADDICTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE -- TO TO TO WIN THEMSELVES OFF THOSE ADDICTIONS AND I FEEL. IF IF THE ALTERNATIVE IS THE STREETS THAT'S WHAT I'M THAT'S WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE DEFINITION OF RECOVERY HOUSING ACTUALLY IS THE HIGH DEFINITION -- THAT IT THAT SORT OF THE TERM OF ART THAT HUD IS USING NOW IT INCLUDES SOBER LIVING FACILITIES AND OTHER KINDS OF SUPPORTED SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENTS -- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT IS NOT OUR GOAL. TO PRECLUDE ANYONE FROM SEEKING OTHER KINDS OF TREATMENT -- THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE HAVE AS A REQUIREMENT THAT PARTICIPATION BE VOLUNTARY. AND THAT IF SOMEONE DECIDES THEY NO LONGER WANT TO REMAIN IN A SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE ASSISTED IN FINDING OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING -- INCLUDING HOUSING THAT IS HARM REDUCTION BASED WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE SOBRIETY IS A CONDITION OF RESIDENTS SO I AGREE WITH YOU. I I I I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE RECOVERY HOUSING DEFINITION BEING A FEDERALLY DEFINED TERM BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE TERM IT'S IS DEFINED HERE AND IT JUST. DOESN'T IT JUST STRIKES ME YOUR YOU'RE STRIPPING OUT THE HOUSING FIRST. REQUIREMENTS AND AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CONSERVE ALSO WANTED TO SAY THE CONCERNS REMAIN HAPPY TO CONTINUE ENGAGE WITH YOU OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO SELL THIS MATTER HERE. YEAH I THINK WE WOULD YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IF POSSIBLE -- I THINK THAT. IT'S A TREATMENT CHOICE OPTION THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE WITH THE CURRENT STATUTORY STRUCTURE AND WE'D LIKE TO GET SOME AGREEMENT THERE I THINK THERE'S ALSO -- AN UNANTICIPATED. SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CBC ARE THAT WE'RE NOT READY TO ADDRESS -- IF THIS LANGUAGES AND PASS AND SO WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO BE -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY KEEP THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING. WELL OF THE CIVIL WAR THING I THINK ALSO WE DON'T THAT POPULATION OUT ON THE STREET. A LIST OF THESE WE HAVE THEM SOMEWHERE THERE'S THERE'S SOME TYPE OF THE GETTING HELP WITH WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT. BUT BEING OUT MYSTERY THE TONE DEVICES THAT DOESN'T DO. ANYBODY ANY GOOD. THEMSELVES OF THE PUBLIC -- AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE A LOT OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. OKAY I WILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT SOARING HOME THIS ITEM OPEN. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR HEARING THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
