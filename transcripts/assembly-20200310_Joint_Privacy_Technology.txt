IS THAT RIGHT. FULL SO. SINCE OUR. I WANNA DO IS AN APPROACH ON THE GROUND BUT I HAVE. OKAY DOING NUMBERS AGAIN. MONDAY I KNOW OPEN OF. YEAH. WORLD HERE. YEAH YEAH. YEAH VERY GOOD OKAY THAT. YEAH AND. HEY. AT HOME. YEAH THERE IS A KIND OF THE. IN ORDER TO YEAH. NOT ONLY FOR OUR- MEMBERS AND- AS A MEDICAL. RAPPING ON. THIS OR. YEAH YEAH- YEAH BREAK OUT THE GAME SALES ORGANIZATION OR. OKAY. YEAH WE CAN'T YEAH. ALL. THAT. YEAH. YEAH YEAH. RIGHT NOW. YEAH. YEAH THANKS FOR. STARZ AND- ONE OF THESE DAYS. MORE. AB. SO. THIS IS THE SAME. THE. SO. THIS. AND. PERIOD. HE. THERE HAS. OKAY. ALL OF. TO GEN. THIS BILL. THE. SIX ONE. YEAH. FOR SOME. AFTER. HEY GOOD THANKS FOR BEING HERE WHEN. IF FEEL LIKE MAKING SOME COMMENTS. PLAYER UP I THINK THIS IS A RESTORATION STRIKE SPENDING. A SURPRISE FOR REMARKS. THAT'S WHY ALL OF THIS STARTED IN. AND. IT'S FINE I MEAN. YOU WANT TO OUTSIDE- THIRTY TOLD IT YOU'RE GOOD FOR YOUR DON'T HANG OUT HERE SENATE YOU WANT TO BE CAPTURED BY THE- THAT'S WHY OUR NECK AND- JUST A SOCIALIST IF YOU WANT TO YOU WANT TO SWAP SEATS WITHOUT GUY I MEAN EVERYONE. I THINK FOR A- FOR THE FANATICS. HIRING NOT PLAY THIS THING. I LIKE TO CALL THIS A HEARING TO ORDER- GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME'S ED SHALL ON THE- CHAIR OF THE PRIVACY CAN MEET IN THE ASSEMBLY I WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO OUR JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON SHOAL RECOGNITION BY G. OR F. R. T. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR. BEING HERE BEING AT THE- SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL OUR PANELISTS- BEING HERE PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE DEVELOPING STORIES SURROUNDING THE CORONA VIRUS AND I AM TRULY GRATEFUL. I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO- WHO WILL BE JOINING US ALSO PETER- THANK OFF. OF THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WATCHING- BE A LIVE STREAM THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION. AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA IS TRULY A FRIEND OF BOTH INNOVATION AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. WHAT WE DO HERE HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON HOW THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND IN THE WORLD ADDRESS TECHNOLOGY POLICY ISSUES. WE ARE HERE TO LEARN HOW FOR T. WORKS HOW COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ARE YOU DOING IT TODAY. THE CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH THE USE OF OUR TEA AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT IN REGULATING THIS RAPIDLY EXPANDING FORM OF TECHNOLOGY. FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY USES BIOMETRICS TO MAP FACIAL FEATURES FROM FOR A- VIDEOS AND COME EARNERS THE INTO. WITH A DATABASE OF KNOWN FACES TO HELP IDENTIFY OR VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF INDIVIDUALS IN IMAGES. WELL THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES ONLY RECENTLY HAS BEGUN TO PERVADE OUR EVERYDAY LIVES AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE. FROM ASSISTING SMARTPHONE USERS IN UNLOCKING OF THEIR PHONES TO ITS USE IN RETAIL STORE THIS CASINO MOST CONCERTS IN AIRPORTS FRT SERVES THE PURPOSE OF IDENTITY THANK PEOPLE FOR A VARIETY OF. REASONS FOR EXAMPLE IT CAN ASSIST IN PREVENTING RETAIL CRIME FIVE MISSING CHILDREN AND VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. NO SEEN THESE IT IS THAT CAUSE DETECTABLE CHANGES IN APPEARANCE FACILITATING SECURE TRANSACTION MAKING TRAVEL WILL CONVENE IN AN ASSISTING LAUNCH. WITH SAFE. THE LATTER WAS RECENTLY ON LATE SO EVIDENCE BY THE RECENT USE OF F. R. T. TO IDENTIFY. THE SUSPECTED KILLER IN MARYLAND'S CAPITAL DOES THAT THE MASS SHOOTING WERE FIVE PEOPLE DIED. NEVERTHELESS EVEN WITH ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF F. R. T. CAN OFF PURSES EIGHTY. COMES WITH CHALLENGES THAT MERIT OUR SCRUTINY I FORTIES CAPABILITIES CREATE THE POSSIBILITY TO SURVEIL EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO ENTERS THE PUBLIC IN AN ORWELLIAN MATTER. ONE OF THEM STEP PROMINENT COUPLE TO EIGHT INVOLVES VIEW A I A COMPANY RECENTLY PROFILE IN OUR BY THE WAY BY THE NEW TIME. IN JANUARY OF TWO TWENTY WHICH HOUSES TUMBLE DATA MORE THAN THREE AND FACES COLLECT. FROM THE IN THAT IN OUR IT WOULD AVAIL TO LOW VOICE. AROUND HONOR. THE SERVER AND PRIVACY ABUSES PRESENTED THIS TO. ARE IN FACT A VERY ALONG. AND EXCESS THE IF. MAY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IN CLEAR OF USE CASE. AND MOST RECENTLY WE LEARNED THAT BEFORE IT BECAME A LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOL OF CLEAR OF USED INVESTORS CLIENTS AND FRIENDS ALL HAD ACCESS TO THE LOCATION. OF THE USED IT TOUGH GILLY AT CLUBS COOLEY UP BY THE NEW YORK TIMES. THEY'RE ALSO CREDIBLE CONCERNS ON THE ACT T. OF F. PARTIES TUNES AND SOME RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. THESE PLEASE ON. A BY A IN FACE RECOGNITION ARGERICH BECAUSE OF THESE CONCERNS THE LEGISLATURE MAY NEED TO STEP IN AND REGULATE THE USE OF OUR TV TO MINIMIZE AND ELIMINATE ANY PRIVACY CONCERNS BY IS CONCERNED ANOTHER WELL DOCUMENTED ISSUES. AS WE STUDY THIS ISSUE IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER TO REMEMBER THAT SIMILAR CONCERNS HAVE RESULTED IN LOCALITIES BANNING THE USE OF F. R. T. MOST NOTABLY THE CITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO AND ALSO OAKLAND. AND TO A PULP THE PUBLIC HOWEVER ATTITUDES REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF F. R. T. DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT. A SURVEY RELEASED BY THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER IN TWENTY NINETEEN REVEALED THAT 56% OF AMERICANS TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES RESPONSIBILITY. AS A TOOL TO ACCESS SECURITY THREATS IN PUBLIC SPACES WHILE A SMALL SHARE OF THE PUBLIC TRUST TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. 36% OR ADVERTISERS 18% TO USE FACIAL RECOGNITION RESPONSIBLY. NOW THAT ARE FAR TIAS HERE AND MORE PREVALENT THAN EVER THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND FULLY WORD STANDS WITHIN THE CURRENT LAW AFTER ALL EVEN THOUGH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT PROTECTION FOR ALL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDES BIOMETRIC. INFORMATION TO CCPA DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY REGULATE F. R. T. WITH TEN OTHER STATES INTRODUCING A LEGISLATION THIS YEAR TO EITHER REGULATE BAN OR STUDIED FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO SHAPE THE FUTURE. OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA BY IDENTIFYING ITS PROMISES AND CHALLENGES AND TO THAT END E. S. LEGISLATORS MUST ENGAGE WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND A BALANCE. BETWEEN CONSERVE SECTION AND BUSINESS INNOVATION WITH THIS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. I'M CONFIDENT THAT OUR ANALYSTS WILL HELP PROVIDE. ALL OF THIS THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY AND WITH THAT INFORMATION WILL TO A DEVELOPING SUS LUCIEN'S FOR ANY OF OUR TEA IS TO SWITCH. TO ADDRESS. I THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING TODAY I AND I LOOK FOR TO A VERY ROBUST AND INFORMATIVE OUR DISCUSSION. AND AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE JOINED US TO GIVE OPENING REMARKS OF DIGITAL DESIRES STARTING WITH THE- BY STATE- VICE CHAIR KILEY. WHICH LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS MISS KILEY. I KNOW BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A VERY INFORMATIVE HEARING. MR OBERNOLTE WOULD YOU LIKE TO FAR I'M VERY GLAD THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. YOU KNOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE A TRANSFORMATIVE POWER TO MAKE SOCIETY BETTER BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO BE USED FOR PURPOSES THE DON'T IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT SO. I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION I THINK THAT WE ALL COME IN HERE WITH AN OPEN MIND- INTO- TRYING TO. ACHIEVE THAT PERFECT BALANCE OF- ENABLING TOOLS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHER AGENCIES ON THE ONE HAND BUT PROTECTING THE PRIACY RIGHTS OF THE CITIZENS WE REPRESENT ON THE OTHER AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THIS TIME I LIKE TO WALK WELCOME OUR FIRST PANELIST SO MATTHEW TURK PRESIDENT OF TOYOTA'S TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE AT CHICAGO AND ALSO A PROFESSOR EMERITUS. AT T. S. IS DEPARTMENT CONSUMER KANNST COMPUTER SCIENCE WHO WILL SPEAK TO THE TOPIC HOW FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WORKS AND ITS RECENT. ADVANCES WELCOME. AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD- BEFORE YOU START YES PROPOSAL TURK WELCOME WELCOME. SO YES I MATTHEW TURK AND I'M GLAD TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME APPRECIATE IT I'VE WORKED IN A FACE RECOGNITION FOR MANY YEARS BEGINNING IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES- AND ON AND OFF SINCE THEN- IN OF ACTUALLY DONE SOME- LEGISLATIVE CONSULTING ABOUT IT AS WELL- SO HAVE SOME DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON IT. SO I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU A BIT ABOUT HOW IT WORKS AND BASICALLY WHAT IT IS- AND JUST GIVE SOME GENERAL- BACKGROUND ABOUT FACE RECOGNITION TO GO FORWARD WITH SO WHAT IS IT. BRIEF HISTORY. OF A LITTLE BIT A THE STATE OF THE ART IN. RECENT ADVANCES IN CHALLENGES IN MOVING FORWARD WITH FACE RECOGNITION. SO I SHOW YOU A PICTURE ON ON A SCREEN OR FISCAL PICTURE WHATEVER- YOU CAN VERY QUICKLY TELL ME. THERE ARE TWO FACES IN THEIR OR THEIR NO FACES AND THEIR OR THAT'S MY BROTHER BILL OR WHATEVER. NO EFFORT ON YOUR PART TO DECIDE SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU TELL ME WHERE THE FACES HOW LARGE THEY ARE YOU CAN MAYBE SAY. WHAT THE SEX OF THE PEOPLE ARE APPROXIMATE AGES ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT THIS PEOPLE IN AN IMAGE- YOU'VE SEEN. THOSE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU PROBABLY GIVE THE IDENTITY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE IMAGE. YOU WOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE PROBLEM THOUGH IF THE PICTURE WAS VERY DARK WERE FOR FACE WORK. WERE FIFTY IS WERE UP SO DOWN. STREAM CAN CURATE. UP PLACES WE SOME IN THE IN YOUR WAS VERY LOW RESIN OR PAUL. MAJOR TOM THING THE PERSON WEARING ON. THIS IS SCOTT EYES THEIR LOT OF CHALLENGE TO FACE RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING THAT WE AS HUMANS DO VERY EASILY AND QUICKLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. BUT IT'S A QUITE A CHALLENGE TO GET IN THE IN TO DO IT. SO THE GOAL OF ALL. FACE CAN IS TO. IS OF THE- MACHINE. GIVE THE CHOICE THE IDEA. OF THAT. LOS THIS IN MAY TO DO FOR THOSE OF THINGS TO ME. SURE TO EXPRESS. IN THIS. THINGS YOU ABLE TO. WIN FROM. RECOGNITIONS IT IS IDENTITY WHO IS THAT PERSON CAN WE TELL WHO THAT PERSON IS. AND THAT SYSTEM CAN BE FULLY AUTONOMOUS THEY CAN MAKE THAT DECISION ITSELF AND MAYBE DO SOMETHING BASED ON THAT DECISION- AWARD COULD ACTUALLY PROVIDE INFORMATION TO GIVE TO A PERSON. LIKE I HAVE PERCENT. OR IT'S ONE OF THESE FIVE PEOPLE MOST LIKELY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN PEOPLE CAN THEN MAKE DECISIONS- BASED ON THAT. SO FACE RECOGNITION IS A PART OF THE FIELD THAT'S CALLED COMPUTER VISION SO MAKING COMPUTERS HE- OR IN SOME CASES AB BETTER THAN PEOPLE SEE. COMPUTER VISION HAS A FIFTY SIX YEAR OLD HISTORY. IT'S USED CURRENTLY IN THINGS LIKE DRIVER ASSISTANCE AUTONOMOUS DRIVING PLANETARY ROVERS INTERPRETING MEDICAL IMAGERY CLASSIFYING AERIAL IMAGERY FACTORY FLOOR WELDING INSPECTION OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION ALL KINDS OF THINGS- AND THIS IS GENERALLY INTELLIGENCE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FACE RECOGNITION SORT OF A SUB SUB AREA OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. IT'S ALSO RELATED- AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TO THIS AREA CALLED BIOMETRICS. BY METRIX'S IDENTIFYING PEOPLE STILL ON THIS TO. OR MORE. OF PHYSIOLOGICAL AND OR BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERISTICS SO FINGERPRINTS I REQUEST RETIN A HAND YOU MAJORITY VOID. GATE THE WAY YOU WALK. GEN AS AS A GENERAL DISCIPLINE HAS A LOT IN COMMON WITH BIOMETRICS OVERLAPS WITH BIOMETRIC SPEND BUT CAN BE QUITE DIFFERENT TIMES TO. SO HERE'S A SLIDE TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF. OF SOME OF THE MAIN THINGS IN THE FAMILY OF FACE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES SO ON THE LEFT COLUMN YOU HAVE A FEW IMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH FACE DETECTION THAT IS. OUR THEIR FACES IN THOSE IMAGES CAN WE FIND THEM AND IDENTIFY WHERE THEY ARE IN THE APPROXIMATE SIZE OF THE FACE AND ALL THAT AND AS YOU CAN SEE. THAT CAN BE DONE POTENTIALLY IN A VIDEO WITH A SINGLE PERSON WITH A FEW PEOPLE STANDING BROWN OR WITH MANY DOZENS PEOPLE FAIRLY ACT. THESE DAYS. THERE'S A OF FACE MODEL SECOND CALL ON THAT SAYS GIVEN A FACE. CAN WE BUILD SOME KIND OF MODEL OF THAT FACE MAYBE IT'S A TWO DIMENSIONAL OR THREE DIMENSIONAL MODEL MAY BE UNDERSTANDS WHERE THE EYES ARE WHERE THE NOSE IS WHERE THE MOUTH IS. A CERTAIN PARAMETERS OF THE FACE IN THE FACIAL FEATURES SO FOR EXAMPLE THE BOTTOM VIDEO CLIP YOU CAN SEE A SNAPSHOT KIND OF FILTER- ON EACH OF THOSE THREE PEOPLE THAT'S THAT'S- BEING PUT ON THEM. CLIP BECAUSE IT'S MODELING FACE KNOWING WHERE TO PUT THAT KIND OF THING. THE THIRD COLUMN IS FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS SO- PEOPLE WORK ON UNDERSTANDING THE FACE AND MOTIONS OF THE FACE. TO GET A SENSE OF HOW IS THE FACE CONFIGURED AT DIFFERENT TIMES BASED ON DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS YOU MIGHT MAKE- HER LEFT EYEBROW MIGHT BE RAISED. PERCENT BE SMILING FOR IN EVER. AND ON THE RIGHTS IS WHAT WE'RE PRIMARILY HERE TO TALK ABOUT FACE RECOGNITION AND THE RELATED SUBSET OF THAT CALL FACE VERIFICATION. IN THE TOP RIGHT SOMEONE IS BASICALLY LOOKING AT THE PHONE TRYING TO LOG IN AND THE PHONE IS TRYING TO DETERMINE IS THIS MERRY OR NOT THAT'S A QUESTION OF VERIFICATION YES OR NO. ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT THERE'S AN IMAGE AND THAT PERSON. WHO'S RED BOXES AROUND HER FACE SHE COULD BE ONE OF HUNDREDS DOZENS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SO THAT'S FACE RECOGNITION TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO OF MANY POSSIBLE PEOPLE IS THIS PERSON. SO ALL OF THESE ARE ARE INVOLVED IN THE FAMILY FACE PROCESSING ANALOGIES BUT IT'S THE FAR RIGHT THAT WERE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH BUT MAY USE ASPECT THE- ALMOST AS WELL. SO HOW FACE SYSTEMS ACOMPLISH. AND THAT'S A OF ABLACK AND WHITE OR COLOR IMAGE- OR MAYBE A VIDEO WHICH IS JUST A BUNCH OF IMAGES- MAYBE THIRTY SIXTY HUNDRED PER SECOND IT COULD BE MULTI VIEW IMAGERY LIKE TWO OR MORE CAMERAS MAKING IT SO FACE. BE A RED IMAGE LOW IN FOR YOUR NEAR INFRARED IT COULD BE A DEATH IMAGE FROM VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES OF IN DEPTH INSTEAD OF INTENSITIES AND OTHERS OR SO COULD BE A COMBINATION OF THINGS. SO IN EMERGES IF WE SEE THE TOP LEFT SO THERE'S A IMAGE OF PEOPLE HAVE COFFEE. AND THE YELLOW BOX THERE IS THEN SHOWN TO THE RIGHT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE COMPUTER SEASON THAT YELLOW BOX THE COMPUTER HAS A BUNCH OF NUMBERS. NUMBER A REPRESENTING INTENSITIES AND COLORS IN THAT PARTICULAR BOX IN THE LARGER IMAGE. SO THERE THERE'S BASE RATE FIRST THERE'S THREE NUMBERS THERE'S- NUMBERS THE COPPER RGB. THAT LITTLE SEARCH NUMBER. SHOWING THE VALUE BEHIND IT OR GREEN AND BLUE THE AS WELL. SO THOSE THOSE LARGE LARGE MATRICES OF NUMBERS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS PERHAPS SEVERAL MILLION NUMBERS ARE BEING FED INTO A COMPUTER TO REPRESENT THAT SINGLE IMAGE SO THE COMPUTERS JOB IS TO TAKE THAT LARGE ARRAY OF NUMBERS. AND FIGURE OUT POTENTIALLY IS THERE A FACE THERE WHO IS THAT PERSON SO IT IT'S A COMPLICATED PROBLEM. AND SEE A PERSON'S FACE AN ARRAY OF NUMBERS AND PROBABLY YOU CAN EITHER BUT THE TASK IS TO MAKE A COMPUTER DO THAT. SO THERE ARE LOTS% CHALLENGES IN DOING THAT WE CAN'T JUST TAKE THOSE NUBERS AND COMPARE TO ANOTHER SET OF NUMBERS AND SEE IS THAT. OR NOT THAT JUST DOES NOT WORK IN THE REASON IS THOSE NUMBERS ARE SO DEPENDENT ON MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS ON THE EXPRESSION THE FACIAL EXPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE. ON THE WAITING OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON THEIR HEAD ORIENTATIONS WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING. ON ON THEIR AGE ON ON A CLINICIANS MAYBE SOMEBODY'S WEARING SUNGLASSES A BASEBALL CAP- ON THE QUALITY OF THE IMAGE ON THEIR THEIR HAIR STYLE THEIR FACIAL. ALL KINDS OF. GOOD DETERMINING THOSE LARGER. NUMBERS AND IT'S AWESOME TO JUST TO MATCH THE NUMBER. SOME SENSE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES- IN TERMS OF CHANGING EXPRESSION CHANGING LIGHTING. CHANGING HEAD ORIENTATION WHERE SOMEONE'S LOOKING FOR THE RESPECT TO A CAMERA CHANGING AGE ON ON THE TOP RIGHT THERE ARE SEVERAL IMAGES OF THE SAME PERSON OVER DECADES OF HER LIFE- IN IN VARIOUS WAYS OF INCLUDING FACES THESE ALL POSE VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS TO FACE RECOGNITION AND TO ANY THOUGHT OF TAKING THAT LARGE LARGE ARRAY OF NUMBERS. IN MAKING SOME SENSE OUT OF IT SO THAT'S KIND OF THE PROBLEM IN A REALLY REALLY HIGH LEVEL SO INSTEAD OF TAKING THE IMAGE OF ONE OF THOSE AND JUST. BRING IT TO HIM OF ME. PEOPLE KEEP FACE RECKON SYSTEM THE WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN EACH OF THOSE IMAGES WHAT'S REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY PART OF THAT PERSON'S IDENTITY THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH OTHER IMAGES OF THAT PERSON SO HAPPEN WE REPRESENT THAT PERSON'S FACE FROM THE DATA. INPUT TO THE COMPUTER IN THE IMAGE SO WE WANT TO IGNORE THE CONFOUNDING FACTORS THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THE LIGHTING THE ORIENTATIONS ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE CORPS REPRESENTATION THEY'RE GONNA REPRESENT THE ESSENCE OF PERSON. ON AND SO IF WE COULD DO THAT PERFECTLY THEN EVERY SINGLE PERSON'S FACE- THE EVERY FACE OF A SINGLE PERSON WOULD MAP TO A PARTICULAR NUMBER OR SET OF NUMBERS OR SOME KIND OF REPRESENTATION. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IT'S TOO DIFFICULT WHAT WE REALLY END UP BEING IS FORM SOME REPRESENTATION OF ANY OF THOSE FACES THE MUCH. VERSION IN ALL MILLION FIRST IT'S A DOZEN OF ARE FOR HUNDRED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THAT THE IDEAS THAT REPRESENTATION IS THE ESSENCE OF A PERSON- TRIES TO BE THE ESSENCE OF THAT PERSON AND THEN COMPARE THOSE REPRESENTATIONS. AND SO THAT IS CLASS FLYING BASES BY COMPARING REP IS FINE FINDING SIMILARITIES BETWEEN A REPRESENTATION YOU JUST COMPUTED FROM IN IN. AN URGENT SINCE YOU HAVE STORED OF VARIOUS THAT YOU COMPUTED BEFORE. ANYTHING RECALL VERY SMACK SOME APPLICATIONS OF A VERY HIGH. APPLICATION ARE IMPORTANT TO GET RIGHT THEN YOU WANT A VERY HIGH BAR FOR THAT SIMILARITY MATCH IF IT'S SOMETHING NOT SO IMPORTANT LIKE. RISING THE PHOTOS ON YOUR PHONE FOR EXAMPLE THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE A MUCH LOWER BAR OF WHAT IT TAKES TO BE COUNTED AS A MATCH. SO THE FIRST ONE OF AUTOMATIC FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS TO DO THIS KIND OF THING WAS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SO LONG TIME AGO. OF THE FIRST SYSTEM THAT RELEASE FROM START TO FINISH WAS A FULLY AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO DO FACE RECOGNITION WAS A PHD THESIS IN JAPAN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE SO ALSO A LONG TIME AGO. THAT'S SYSTEM REQUIRED A FRONTAL VIEW OF A FACE THAT WOULDN'T WORK ON ANY OTHER KIND OF USE- IT FOUND ABOUT TWENTY DIFFERENT FEATURES ON THE FACE IMAGE WHERE THE EYES ARE THE WITH OF THE EYES. THE WITH OF THE LIPS THE WITH OF THE OF THE MOUTH- NOSTRILS A BUNCH OF POINTS ON THE FACE. AND THEN IT TOOK SEVERAL COMBINATIONS OF THOSE POINTS DISTANCES RATIOS ANKLES THINGS LIKE THAT AND CAME UP WITH SIXTEEN MEASURES SIXTEEN NUMBERS. THAT WHAT THE REPRESENTATION OF FACE THE GOING FROM. SHOULD TO SICK. FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO TRY TO DO THIS- AND THE COMMON THEME WAS LET'S THINK ABOUT WHAT A FACES AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE A REPRESENTATION THAT WOULD DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE. NOT A LOT OF SUCCESS IN IN A REAL WORLD. AND ACTUALLY SOME PRETTY WELL KNOWN FAILURES DURING THAT TIME. AROUND NINETEEN NINETY THERE ARE SOME APPROACHES THAT- STARTED TO EXPLORE A FOCUS ON LEARNING FROM THE DATA INSTEAD OF. THE HUMAN PROGRAMMERS AND RESEARCHERS SAYING LET'S TRY TO THINK HOW TO DO THIS. THE THIS NEW IDEA WAS LET'S AND DATE A BUNCH OF FACE IMAGES AND LABELED FACE IMAGES OF WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE. BRING THEM TO IT MACHINE A LET THE COMPUTER FIGURE OUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT INSTEAD OF THE P. IN A PROJECT. TO IMPORTANT. SO THIS IS WHAT'S THE MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO FACE RECOGNITION TRAINING SYSTEM. WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF DATA LABELED FACE IMAGES TRANTOR REPRESENT THOSE FACE IMAGES EFFICIENTLY AND WELL. THE TRAINING CAN TAKE A VERY LONG TIME WITHIN A TRAINS A SYSTEM THAT CAN BE RUN VERY VERY QUICKLY. OKAY SO ABOUT FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS THAT WAS- WORKED ON MORE AND MORE AND THEN IN RECENT YEARS THE LAST. TEN FIFTEEN OR SO YEARS THERE'S BEEN A REVOLUTION IN THIS AREA KNOWN AS DEEP LEARNING WHICH IS PART OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. WHERE MORE DATA BECAME AVAILABLE MUCH FASTER MACHINES AVAILABLE AND BETTER. IS TO CHECK IN THE SYSTEM. SO BAY. WHAT IS THE THIS WAY OF LEARNING FROM DATA. OF INSTRUCTING THE TEAM PEOPLE HAS VERY. SOON PASSED YEARS AND BY THE WAY A LOT THAT'S TAKEN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA IT UNIVERSITIES ANDBENEATH. SO THIS IS A SAMPLE. OF AND VERSION OF. DEEP NEURAL NETWORK TO DO FACE IN THEIR- SOCIAL NETWORK- FRIEND TAGGING YOUR FACE TAGGING AND BASICALLY IT'S JUST A REPRESENTATION OF WERE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE DETAILS WEAR A FACE ON THE LEFT INPUT TO THE SYSTEM- EITHER ON THE TOP WRITER TOP BOTTOM THERE JUST TO FOR TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF SHOWING THE SAME THING AND IT GETS SORT OF RUN THROUGH THAT DEEP NEURAL NETWORK IN AT THE FAR RIGHT. IS A- SMALL AREA REPRESENT. ACTION THE HE IS THE A RELATIVE SMALL OF NO SO THIS DEEP NETWORK TAKES A LONG TIME TO TRAIN IT CAN TAKE DAYS TO TRAIN EVEN A WEEK SOMETIME TO TRAIN BUT THEN IT CAN BE RUN ONCE IT'S TRAIN VERY VERY QUICKLY AND IT TURNS AT THE- I. DEEP NETWORKS UP. FRONT PROGRESS GOING FROM THE SIXTEEN PARAMETERS FROM DECADES AGO TO MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PARAMETERS THAT ARE LEARNED IN THIS TRAINING PROCESS THE CONVENTICLES RECOGNITION VERY VERY QUICKLY. SO MODERN FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ARE SOME VERSION OF THIS KIND OF SYSTEM- DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS THE DETECTIVE FACE THE A LINE PROP AND RE SIZE OF FACE THE REPRESENTED AT THE END OF THAT NEURAL NETWORK AND THEY DO SOME KIND OF CLASSIFICATION. THEY MAKE ERRORS THEIR ERRORS IN EACH OF THOSE STEPS- AND THERE'S ERRORS IN THE TRAINING BUT THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE COMPARED TO THE PAST AND HAS IN SOME CASES SURPASSED HUMANS AND HUMANS ABILITIES. SO CURRENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN FACE RECOGNITION CONTINUES TO WORK ON DOING THIS BUT IN. UNSTRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT SO TO WORK ANYWHERE IN ANY KIND OF FACE IMAGERY- TO WORK OVER AS SOMEBODY AGES- TO- IT DO IT WITH VERY LITTLE TRAINING DATA. TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S REVOKE HERBAL SO IN CASE YOUR INFORMATION GETS LOST OR STOLEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT WON'T TO BE NECESSARILY- A TERRIBLE THING. AND SO THE GRAND CHALLENGE A FACE RECOGNITION IS TO BUILD FIX RECOGNITION FICK FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS THAT ARE ACCURATE ROBUST EASY TO USE EXTENSIBLE WORKS WELL FOR EVERYBODY. AND USABLE ONLY IN WAYS THAT ARE SAFE RESPONSIBLE ACCESSIBLE AN ETHICAL AND THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CONTINUE TO WORK ON TODAY. SO WE'RE VERY QUICK VERSION OF HOW I SEE FACE RECOGNITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR THAT PRESENTATION- BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ALSO WELCOME A COLLEAGUE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF A ROUTE THREE OF US SO WHO HAS EXTENSIVE- ENGINEERING BACKGROUND IS ALL THANK YOU. FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR- OBERNOLTE OKAY. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS SO. I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THIS LAST SLIDE. THAT ILLUSTRATES THE WAY THAT THE DEEP LEARNING IS- IS USED TO APPLY TO THE DATA SO- IF I UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT AND I'M NOT SURE I DO BUT- THEY'RE WITH ME SO- WE'VE GOT. VARIOUS LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. WHEN WE'RE GOINGFROM A FACE. YOU KNOW PICTORIAL PRESENTATION WITH FACE. UP INTO OF IF YOU KNOW IT FINAL RESULT WHICH TO CALL. A START LIMITED SORT OF COORDINATES THAT YOU KNOW REPRESENTS YOU KNOW NUMERICALLY WHAT THE FACES. SO IN THE CASE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION- IS HUMAN INTERVENTION USED TO DECIDE WHAT THOSE LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION ARE I MEAN WE SAY OKAY. IN THIS LEVEL WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW FOR THE OP ARE IN THE IN THE STATE. OF THE EYES IN THIS LEVEL WE'RE TALKING. YOU KNOW SHAPE OF YEARS OR WHATEVER IT IS. OR IS. HE THE MACHINE OR- AND- THAT IS WELL. YEAH SO. THE LATTER THE MACHINELEARNING IS CONTROL OF THAT THE FORMER SORT OF HOW HEALTH PEOPLE USED TO DO THINGS. AND NOW WE LET THE DATA DETERMINE. BUT YOU. HAVING SAID THAT THERE'S STILL THE QUESTION OF HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD THIS SYSTEM IN PERSON. SEN WAS SORT OF SORT OF THE OVAL ARE ALL OVERALL ARE. SURE IN WHICH THE LEARNING TAKES PLACE IN WHICH DATA. TRACK ASSIST. AND SO THEY SORT OF. SOME ICE. AB TWO ONE. THE MACHINE IS MAKING THE DECISIONS IN NOT IT'S NOT A PERSONAL. IT POINT SAYING LEARNED THIS VAN AND- THEN OKAY. SO THEN ASKING THE QUESTION IN REVERSE I KNOW ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS HAS BEEN THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO ASK THEM IT THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO JUSTIFY HOW IT MADE A CERTAIN DECISION SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU SHORT YOU ASKED THE QUESTION RIVERS AND SORT OF SHOWING A FACE. AND. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW WHAT THE FACES AND I THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO USING THIS TECHNOLOGY IN A LAWN PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW WHAT- IF WE HAVE TO GO TO COURT AND WE USE IT IN AN EVIDENTIARY WAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE JUSTIFICATION FOR. YOU KNOW WHY WE THINK THIS IS THE WAY IT IS SO IS THERE A WAY AS THEY DON'T OF THE DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT ARE BEING USED FOR THE SYSTEM IS THERE A WAY TO CREATE THAT RIVERS JUSTIFICATION. THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S A WELL KNOWN CONCERN AND PROBLEM AND IN FACT THE GOVERNMENT IS FUNDING PROGRAMS- CALLED EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICE ARTIST SO INTELLIGENCE IN GENERAL TO DO THAT SORT OF THING- BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THERE ARE. VERY GOOD TOOLS RIGHT NOW THAT ACCOMPLISH THAT IT'S A PEOPLE ARE ON THEIR WAY WORKING TOWARD THAT END. RIGHT THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON THE SAME LINE. OBVIOUSLY THE HOW THE DECISION IS BEING MADE IS DETERMINED BY THE- TYPE OF OTHER THAN BEING USED. AND I PRESUME THERE THERE IS- GOOD AUGER RHYTHMS OUT THERE AND THERE ARE. A BETTER ARE YOUR THE OTHER ISMS OUT THERE OR OR NOT AS GOOD SO. SO HOW DO HOW DO HOW DOES ONE DETERMINE. OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT TO USE I KNOW IT'S PART OF IT IS THE DENNIS STANDARD AND ALL THAT BUT- BUT HOW. HOW CAN LET'S A LAY PERSON YOU KNOW DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. A CERTAIN A PARTICULAR ORDER THEM OUGHT TO BE USE OR HOW HOW IT A- LOGARITHM. OUGHT TO BE JUDGED. FO EXAMPLE. WILL GENERALLY LAY PERSON IS NOT GOING TO BE MAKING THAT DECISION RIGHT LAY PERSON'S GOING TO BUY AN IPHONE AND- THEIR SYSTEMS GOING TO LET YOU IN IT OR NOT RIGHT OR LAY PERSON'S GOING TO GO TO THE AIRPORT AND SOMEONE SYSTEM IS GOING TO. LET THAT PERSON THROUGH OR NOT- SO IT'S OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE PRESUMABLY YOU KNOW MORE INFORMED AND ABLE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THE SYSTEMS AND MAKE THOSE CHOICES. OR OR AT ARE YOU ASKING SOMETHING DIFFERENT YEAH I THINK ESSENTIALLY THAT THAT'S IT. NOW ALL IN LIGHT OF ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU MENTION- SUED THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS- YOU KNOW IF ART. THE TECHNOLOGY OUR- THE GOOD. TIME THE BASE. SAID UP. HOW TO DEPLOY A- G. R. IN A CELL. R. IT SO THEN. YOU KNOW. THEN MAYBE JUST THE PART OF. FIRST YES WITH VERY. KEEPING MIND THAT FOR. RECOGNITION IS A LOT OF THINGS ARE HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF APPLICATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE. IT TO USE IT TO- AUTOMATICALLY. CLUSTER IMAGES ON YOUR LARGE IMAGE COLLECTION ON YOUR PHONE OR COMPUTER OR SOMETHING- THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT IT'S NOT GONNA HURT TOO MANY PEOPLE HIGH THINK AT ALL. IF THEIR MISTAKES IN THEIR- IN FACE RECOGNITION CAN DO A GREAT JOB OF THAT RIGHT NOW. OR FOR EXAMPLE SUGGESTING A FRIEND TO BE YOU KNOW LABELED IN YOUR PERSONAL COLLECTION OF IMAGES. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE KINDS OF BEHAVIORS. AND SO FACE RECKON IT FACE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN USED FOR A LOT FOR A WHILE NOW FOR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IS IT READY TO BE FULLY AUTOMATIC TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON THE DECISION. IT'S GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SOMEBODY'S LIFE. IT DEPENDS THE SCENARIO. IMAGE CENTER IT DEPENDS THAT AFFECTS IS THERE. KIND OF. IF IN THAT CASE. US I. THINK IT'S A- YES WHEN. THE SORT OF A- LIKE A TO A- I. ARMED HEY SIR IS NOW YOUR MENTION ABOUT THE 30% TO THE- TO THE EQUATION I WANTED TO TRY THAT THE OF THE OF THE TWO. NOW FOR SOMEFACES PART PART OF THE FACE IS BEING CONCEALED OR LET'S SEE IF SOMEBODY'S MOVING THEN ALL THOSE THINGS WILL COME INTO PLAY I PRESUME. YEAH THE- QUESTION THAT I HAVE WAS. ARE YOU LET'S SAY. OUGHT WHAT ABOUT DIFFERENT CAMERAS LET YOU KNOW. ARE THERE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE CAMERA FOR EXAMPLE. POTENTIALLY I I'D SAY A MORE SIGNIFICANT CORE ISSUE OR QUESTION IS JUST THE IMAGINING ENVIRONMENT OR IS IT SORT OF A PASSPORT PHOTO SCENARIO WHERE SOMEONE'S WALKING IN IT IN FRONT OF A CAMERA AND LOOKING AT THE CAMERA AND WAITING FOR THE PICTURE TO BE TAKEN. OR ARE YOU LOOKING AT PEOPLE WALKING DOWNTOWN AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THAT SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A MUCH BIGGER DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THOSE TWO SCENARIOS. THAN MAYBE ONE CAMERA CAMERON IN MOST SITUATIONS. GOT IT ARE EIGHT. OKAY THIS CREDIT CARD I JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION BEFORE THAT SO ARE YOU ARE WE ABLE TO- GENERATE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OR- BY YOU KNOW ADJUSTING THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS UP ORDER DOWNWARD- CALIBRATE THE- YOU KNOW THE CERTAINTY ARE THE ODDS OF A FALSE POSITIVE OR A FALSE NEGATIVE AND THEN ADJUST THAT ACCORDINGLY DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION- YES AND NO SO YES UNCERTAINTIES ARE CALCULATED WITH MOST COMPOSED OF THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE USEFUL BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUAL- OFFICE. THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW- PROBABILITIES AND SO THEY'RE USEFUL NUMBERS THEY CAN HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE USER OF THE SYSTEM OR OR THE PERSON LOOKING AT THE DECISIONS MADE BY THE SYSTEM HOW COMMON IT WAS THAT DECISION I NEED I WILL CHOOSE A OR LIKE A BAT OF THERE'S NO pTHOSE UNCERTAINTIES. I'M THINKING OF KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A DNA ACT OR SOMETHING THIS AS THEIR AND WANTED BILLION JAN THAT THIS IS WRONG I COULD SIMILAR. STATEMENTS BE MADE. YES I DON'T KNOW HOW. PRECISE SUCH STATEMENTS CAN BE MADE TODAY BUT I BELIEVE IT'S MOVING THAT DIRECTION BE ABLE TO MAKE QUITE PRECISE STATEMENTS ABOUT THAT BUT EVEN EVEN IF THE DNA THERE'S A THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THOSE RIGHT SO WITH ALL OF FROM THERE WOULD BE. I THINK IF I COULD GO BACK OUT I THINK THAT WAS THE QUESTION KIND OF THE QUESTION THAT I WAS GOING TO. ASK AND THAT IS THE ERROR. I MEAN IS THERE A THRESHOLD IS A- HE ARE- INDICATED THAT. PEOPLE CAN USE TO SAIL. THIS PROGRAM IS LET'S SAY 5% ERROR RATE IN. YOU KNOW IS THERE SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CAN USE. OUR FAMILY NAME IS FOR THOSE PERSPECTIVE. AGAIN I SEE THAT MORE AS SOMEONE WHO'S IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM FOR THEIR COMPANY YOUR GOVERNOR WHATEVER TO LOOK AT THOSE KINDS OF NUMBERS FOR THE VENDORS YOU MIGHT CONSIDER. YOU KNOW PURCHASING A SYSTEM FROM I DON'T SEE HOW- LAYPERSON CONSUMER WILL NECESSARILY MAKE USE OF THOSE KINDS OF NUMBERS I WAS ONE OF THE TWENTY PLUS LEGISLATORS ARE MISIDENTIFIED BY PROGRAM BY WAY OF FORTY PROGRAM. AND SUBSEQUENT TO THAT I THINK I SOMEBODY MENTIONED TO ME THAT. IF DE UM. IF THE THRESHOLD WAS ADJUSTED PROPERLY ON MEANING THAT LET'S SEE IF THE ERROR RATE WAS SALAS AND FIVE PERCENT. THEN THE YOU KNOW I WOULD BEEN OF PROPERLY IDENTIFIED BY THE PROGRAM- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF COMMON IN IN THE INDUSTRY- YES- AND AN MEANS TWO THINGS TO SAY THAT THAT ERROR RATE. GOES DOWN EVERY YEAR SO IN A WITH A AS OF TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THIS IT GETS BETTER ALL THE TIME- AND- YES YOU IF. ARE PROPERLY LOOKING AT NOT ONLY THE ANSWER BUT ALSO THE UNCERTAINTY MEASURE OR YOU KNOW OTHER INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- THERE THERE'S MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS. THAN SOME OF THESE PUBLIC TEST MIGHT ACTUALLY LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE. GOT IT OKAY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ON ALL RIGHT THEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WE MAY HAVE MORE QUESTIONS LATER ON SO- SO. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL. OUR WHO WILL DISCUSS THE TOPIC OF CURRENT AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL SETTINGS AND- WE HOW FOR THIS PANEL A MISTER JAKE PARKER WHO IS SENIOR DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE SECURITY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION AND DARRYL LUCIEN A REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE A WELCOME AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAMES FOR THE RECORD. THANK YOU SIR- JAKE PARKER WITH SECURITY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION- CHAIRMAN SHALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY- STIRRED INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS OVER ONE THOUSAND COMPANIES PROVIDING SECURITY PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. CUTTING HUNDRED FORTY TWO HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE MANY DEVELOPERS OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY HOME TO SEVERAL LEADERS IN THIS FIELD I ACTUALLY WANTED TO- BEFORE PROCEEDING OF THE QUESTION WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE LAST SEGMENT- SO THE MAYBE HELP LIKE I COULD EXPLAIN SO- EVEN A SIMPLER WAITED TO UNDERSTAND FISH RECOGNITION IS BASICALLY. COME UP PHOTO COMPARISON TOOL SO YOU'VE GOT ONE PHOTO YOU'RE COMPARING IT WITH ONE OR MANY MORE OTHER PHOTOS. THE JOB DID THE PART THAT IS THAT THE MACHINE DOES IS CREATE A SIMILARITY SCORE RATES THAT FOR OTHER PHOTO OR OTHER PHOTOS ON HOUSE SOMEWHERE THEY ARE TOO. THE PHOTO YOU'RE COMPARING AGAINST IN SO- BUT AS YOU MENTIONED- GERMAN AT THE- THRESHOLD IS SAT. OVER WHICH THE SYSTEM MAKES A- POTENTIAL MATCH DETERMINATION OR MASTURBATION UNDER WHICH IT DOESN'T. SET THRESHOLD IS ABSOLUTELY- ADJUSTED BY HUMAN SO EITHER THE OPERATOR WHERE THE DEVELOPER WAS SAID IT AND THAT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON THE PURPOSE. SO JUST TO TWO EXAMPLES ONE IF THE PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM IS TO HELP SPEED ENTRIES LIKE SAY TO UP TO A VENUE- YOU WANT TO SET IT SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A LOT OF FALSE- FALSE. THIS IS MISS RATES SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE LINE'S ANY LONG SOMEONE SOMEONE MAYBE IT'S POSITIVE SOMEONE IS A TICKET THAT'S KIND OF UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN THAT'S NOT AS MUCH OF A CONCERN. ON THE FLIP SIDE. SHOW LIKE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS YOU WANT TO SET THAT THRESHOLD REALLY HIGH- SO YOU MAKE SURE YOU'RE- GONNA MAKE SURE THE ACTRESSES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I SO APPRECIATE MR TRICKS- PRESENTATION ALSO AS YOU KNOW- MISTER GROWTH- FROM THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TODAY AND COULDN'T ATTEND- WE WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY BENEFITED FROM HIS- OVERVIEW OF NEXT- EVALUATION OF FACE RECOGNITION WHICH IS GOING ON FOR TWENTY YEARS. IT'S DEFINITELY A WORLD STANDARD ON EVALUATING ACCURACY OF THE OF THE ALGORITHMS. ARE BASICALLY IN LOOKING AT THIS WORK THE BOTTOM LINE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT MODERN MODERN FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS HIGHLY ACCURATE- N'EST IS FOUND AT THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE TEST IS NOW MORE THAN TWENTY TIMES IS ACCURATE. AND JUST A FEW YEARS AGO AND RETRIEVING A MATCHING PHOTO FROM DATABASE. IS SEPTEMBER REPORT FOUND CLOSE TO PERFECT PERFORMANCE BY HIGH QUALITY ALGORITHMS WITNESS RATES AVERAGING JUST POINT ONE PERCENT. THIS REACHES THE ACCURACY OF AUTOMATED FINGERPRINT COMPARISON WHICH IS AS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR IDENTIFICATION. ON THE ISSUE OF DEMOGRAPHIC EFFECTS ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING MORE ABOUT- THIS HEARING. THE CONTEXT IS CRITICAL BECAUSE- IMAGE QUALITY ISSUES MANY OF WHICH WERE WORKED ARE SHOWN IN THE LAST PRESENTATION. HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGED AFTER SEEING NOT- DEMOGRAPHIC EFFECTS. A HOWEVER- THE OUR VIEW IS THAT THE REASON THIS DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN DECEMBER. PROVIDES A CONFERENCE OF ANSWER TO MANY OF OUR MOST PRESSING QUESTIONS ABOUT FACIAL RECOGNITION ACCURACY. I AND RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT BIAS. IT FOUND THE HIGHEST PERFORMING ALGORITHMS HAD UNDETECTABLE DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE ACROSS DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. WHILE MOST OTHERS PERFORMED MORE CONSISTENTLY THAN AND WIDELY REPORTED IN THE MEDIA AND ALSO IN SEVERAL NON SCIENTIFIC TESTS. WELL SOME COMMENTARY SPOKES ON THE VERY LOWEST PERFORMING ALGORITHMS IT'S IMPORTANT POINT OUT THAT KEY GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY USING SO THE HIGHEST PERFORMING TECHNOLOGY DEFIED. WITH ACCURACY RATES WELL ABOVE POSITIVE PERFORMANCE ACROSS DEMOGRAPHICS EVEN WHEN TESTED AGAINST GALLERIES OF UP TO TWELVE MILLION. IMAGES SO TO FULLY COMPREHEND THE BENEFITS THIS TECHNOLOGY YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE USE OF IT. WHICH IS TYPICALLY TO ASSIST NOT REPLACE HUMAN ANALYSIS AND DECISION MAKING. IS BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF HUMAN RECOGNITION ONLY. HEAR THE EVIDENCE IS INDISPUTABLE AS DOCUMENT IN THIS STUDY JUST TWO YEARS AGO AND ELSEWHERE. AUTOMATED FACIAL RECOGNITION ALONG WITH EVEN ANALYSIS IS MORE ACCURATE AND LESS BIASED THAN HUMAN RECOGNITION ALONE. YOU'VE LIKELY HEARD SOME PERSPECTIVES THE CALL FOR SEVERELY RESTRICTING OR EVEN BANNING THE TECHNOLOGY. THE KEY QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO LIMIT PROCESSES TO HUMAN CAPABILITY ALONE WHEN THIS ADVANCED TOOLS AVAILABLE. SPECIAL WERE IMPACTS SAFETY AND SECURITY. IN THE BENEFITS ARE NOT IT POTENTIAL OR HYPOTHETICAL THEY ARE PROVEN AND GROWING. THE PUBLIC SECTOR FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN USED FOR OVER A DECADE IMPROVE THE SPEED ACCURACY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS. AND ANY PROCESS WORKERS POTENTIAL HIGH CONSEQUENCE OUTCOMES THE TECHNOLOGY SERVES ONLY AS A TOOL TO ASSIST PERSONNEL. THIS MAY EXPLAIN US LAW ENFORCEMENT'S DECADE PLUS OPERATING HISTORY IN MANY THOUSANDS OF INSTANCES WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMED EXAMPLE OF THE TECHNOLOGY RESULTING IN A MISTAKEN ARRESTOR IN PRISON AND- ONE SUCCESS STORY RESCUING. TRAFFICKING VICTIMS IN APRIL LAST YEAR A CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SAW SOCIAL MEDIA POST ABOUT A MISSING CHILD. THE OFFICER USED SPECIAL RECOGNITION TOOL CALLED SPOTLIGHT RETURNING A LIST OF ONLINE SIX ADS FEATURING THE GIRL. ACCORDING TO A STORY IN WIRED MAGAZINE THE GIRL HAD BEEN SOLD FOR WEEKS. BUT THE OFFICERS ACTIONS HELP FOR- A PROCESS TO RECOVER HER IMPROVED FROM TRAUMA. SHE WAS JUST ONE OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND VICTIMS RESCUED USING THIS TOOL JUST LAST COUPLE YEARS. IN AUGUST LAST YEAR THE NYPD RESPONDED WITH A MAN SPARK TERROR BY LEADING RICE COOKERS AROUND SUBWAY STATION. YEAH USE FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY HIM- FROM THEIR REST DATABASE WITHIN ONE HOUR. OFFICIALS LATER QUOTED SAYING TO NOT USE THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE NEGLIGENT. IN MAY LAST YEAR THREE MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY WERE SHOT AND KILLED BY A MAN AT A HOME IN WAYNE COUNTY MICHIGAN. DETROIT POLICE DEPARTMENT USE FACIAL RECOGNITION OTHER METHODS TO HELP IDENTIFY THE SUSPECT BASED ON SECURITY FOOTAGE FROM NEARBY GAS STATION. HE'S ALSO BEEN USED TO SOLVE COLD CASES. AFTER SIXTEEN YEAR MANHUNT A MAN WAS APPREHENDED IN OREGON IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS. ACCUSEDOF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A MINOR. AND USING THE TECHNOLOGY THE FBI WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SUSPECT AFTER YOU APPLY FOR US PASSPORT. THE TECHNOLOGY ALSO PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN DETECTING FRAUD IN STATE PROGRAMS WHICH ENABLE THE JEDI STUFF THAT'S USED FOR ALL SORTS OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES FISHER A CONDITION SYSTEM SPARKED AN INVESTIGATION LEADING THE LARGEST FORCED LABOR TRAFFICKING CASE AND UNITED STATES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE. NEW YORK'S DMB FAN MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND CASES INVOLVING DRIVERS WITH RECORDS UNDER MORE THAN ONE IDENTITY. SO THERE ALSO MANY NON LAW ENFORCEMENT USES THAT ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SECTOR LIKE SECURE AUTHENTICATION ACCESS CONTROL FOR SENSITIVE AREAS OF BUILDINGS AND USES PARTY SECURITY SYSTEMS TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES AND VISITORS. TO GOVERNMENT FACILITIES. MANY SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED OR ARE CONSIDERING THE TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT STUDENTS AND TEACHERS BY NOTIFYING THEM. WHEN IN A REAL PERSON OF INTEREST ARISES FACILITY SUCH AS A SEX OFFENDER SOMEONE WHO'S MADE VIOLENT THREATS. IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR SWITCHING GEARS BUT RECOGNITION IS PROVIDING ENORMOUS BENEFITS PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS AN OPTION TO SECURELY AND CONVENIENTLY PROVE THEIR IDENTITY IN ORDER TO INTERVENE YOU. BOARD A PLANE PERFORMING VOTE ONLINE TRANSACTIONS AND ACCESS PERSONALIZED EXPERIENCES. ALL WHILE REDUCING THE NEED TO SHOW DOCUMENTS CONTAINING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE AND EXPOSE THEM TO POTENTIAL HUMAN VICE. NEWPORT'S ACCOUNTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM SAN JOSE TO ATLANTA TECHNOLOGIES GIVING PASTORS THE OPTION MORE QUICKLY. PASS FROM THE CURBSIDE AIRPLANE SEAT. SPECIFIC TO THE SECURITY INDUSTRY IS ALSO ENABLING BUSINESSES TO BETTER PROTECT THEIR EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS AND PROPERTY. OFFICIAL RECOGNITION COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SECURITY FOR ACCESS CONTROL TO PUT ARGUMENT OTHER CREDENTIALS SUCH AS KEYS ARE CARDS THESE CAN BE SHARED SOLENT STONER SIMPLY LOST- BIOMETRIC ENTRY SYSTEMS CAN ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONVENIENCE REGISTERED USERS OR SING US A LARGE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. WHEN IT WAS ARGUES WITH TURNSTILES FOR EMPLOYEES AUTHORIZED- TO ACCESS THE BUILDING AND ITS COMBAT DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE SPEED OF ENTRY HAS ELIMINATES FUMBLING FOR CREDENTIALS. ALLEN'S OF HIGH SECURITY NEEDS CAN USE THE PHOTOGRAPH ALONG WITH OTHER CREDENTIAL TO EASILY ADD MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION. THE TECHNOLOGY ALSO IVES BUSINESSES THE ABILITY TO ALERT STAFF TO POTENTIAL DANGER SITUATION WHERE A PERSON WITH A RESTRAINING ORDER OR A DISGRUNTLED FORMER EMPLOYEE FOR EXAMPLE INTENDS TO ENTER. ANOTHER EXAMPLE THE TECHNOLOGIES BEING USED TO ADDRESS SKYROCKETING ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME CALIFORNIA UNDERSTATES. SOME STORES USING FACIAL RECOGNITION ENTRY POINTS TO ELLER CUSTOMER SERVICE STAFF TO GREET KNOWN THIEVES WHEN THEY ENTER PROPERTY AND OFFER THEM CUSTOMER SERVICE. THIS MODERN DAY QUICK A QUICK WANTED POSTING SHOPLIFTERS PRINTED PHOTO CAN HELP DETER CRIME WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ONE CASE STORES USING THIS STRATEGY OR FINDING THAT OVER HALF THE INDIVIDUALS AND ROLLED STOP SHOPLIFTING IN COVER STORES AFTER TWO THREE VISITS 90% STOP AFTER EIGHT TO TEN VISITS PRODUCT SHRINKAGE IT IS REDUCED BY 3270% MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE USING THE TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT OUR CUSTOMERS AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD. SOMEONE ATTEMPTS TO OPEN A LINE OF CREDIT USING A FACE PIC DRIVER'S LICENSE WITH A CUSTOMER'S REAL INFORMATION. THIS IS DETECTED IF THE TELLER TAKES HER PART WAS PHOTOS PARTY APPLICATION PROCESS JUST CHECKED AGAINST THE REAL INFORMATION. IT'S ALSO INCREASINGLY POURED TO THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. THE REGISTRATION AND MENTIONED INNOCENT MISSION TO A VENUE A RECOGNITION IN V. I. P. PROGRAMS OR OTHERWISE THE PERSONALIZED. CUSTOMER SERVICE. SO IN IN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IT'S ALSO USED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS- IN THIS IS BECOMING INCREASING PORT TO HELP PROTECT THE SAFETY AND- PATIENTS AND STAFF. AND ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS- CONCERNS ABOUT COVERT NINETEEN MOUNT. THIS INCLUDES PROVIDING TOUCH WAS ACCESS IT ONLY TRAINING AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL CAN ENTER SENSITIVE AREAS LIKE CLEAN ROOMS IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE RISK OF CONTAMINATION. FISHER RECOGNITION OTHER BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES TECHNOLOGIES CAN ALSO PROVIDE A WAY TO IDENTIFIED UNCONSCIOUS PATIENTS IN NEED OF EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. SEVERAL IS REASONS IT'S CLEAR TO US TECHNOLOGY MAKES OUR CITIZENS SAFER BRINGS VALUES FOR LIVES WHEN IT'S USED EFFECTIVELY AND RESPONSIBLY. WE BELIEVE IN A BROAD RANGE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR APPLICATIONS TRANSPARENCY SHOULD BE THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE TO ENSURE RESPONSIBLE USE WITHOUT UNREASONABLY RESTRICTING THIS ESSENTIAL TECHNOLOGY TOOL. SO TELL ME OF ANY POLICY IN THIS AREA MUST TAKE A RISK BASS AND USED USE BASED SPECIFIC APPROACH. BECAUSE THE USES ARE SO VARIED AND BECAUSE THESE PRESENT EXTREMELY VERY PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS WHICH DEPEND ON THE APPLICATION. ANY INVOLVED ANY VERIFICATION ORDERS ALREADY CONSENT OR EXISTING REQUIREMENT TO PROVE ONE'S IDENTITY IN THESE HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON PRIVACY OR CIVIL LIBERTIES. IN OTHER APPLICATIONS A PROPERTY OWNER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SECURE THE PREMISES USING TECHNOLOGY BUT OTHERWISE SHOULD OBTAIN CONSENT BEFORE OFFERING CONVENIENCE OUR COMMERCIAL BENEFITS. THE APPROACH NEEDS TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND THOROUGH. I RUSHED IMPLEMENT ONE SIZE FITS ALL RULES COULD RESULT IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE FULL RANGE OF THESE USES ARE NOT CONSIDERED. SHOULD ALSO BE A PRICKLY FLEXIBLE TAILORED TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RISKS THAT A SPECIFIC APPLICATION MAY POSE. WELL ANY TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR PURPOSES THAT ARE ETHICAL NON DISCRIMINATORY AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THAT'S WHY IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPARENCY TO ACCOMPANY GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS. PRACTICAL MEASURES IN THIS AREA INCLUDE POSTING CLEAR USE POLICIES PROVIDING PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS IMPLEMENTING% PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR TOP PERFORMING TECHNOLOGIES AS WE SEE THERE'S QUITE A RANGE OF DIFFERENCES IN HOW THEY PERFORM. ANY OTHER HAND WIDE REACHING RESTRICTIONS A SINGLE OUT JUST ONE TECHNOLOGY TOOL WILSON WE FAIL TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT UNDERLYING SOCIAL JUSTICE AND OTHER CONCERNS ARE THE ROOT OF ANY OF OFFICIAL RECOGNITION DEBATES. AS THE COMMITTEE EXAMINE THESE ISSUES WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS. IN ON BEHALF OF SIA APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE OUR COLLECTIVE INPUT FROM THE INDUSTRY AND DO MY BEST TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE NEXT NEXT WHEN IS PLEASE. YEAH AFTERNOONS TO CHAIRMAN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. FOR THE RECORD MY NAME STERILE LUCIEN I REPRESENT THE TEN THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN OF THE LA POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE. THIS IS THE THIRD LARGEST POLICE UNION IN THE COUNTRY IN THE LARGEST HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE CURRENT AND FUTURE USES OF FACIAL RATE FAKEL FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN GOVERNMENT SETTING SO I WILL FOCUS ON THESE USES AND THEN. DELVE INTO SOME OF THE MYTHS AND PERCEPTIONS- THAT ARE. FAIRLY PREVALENT WITH THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT. HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS DEPARTMENTS WOULD TAKE DAYS WEEKS OR LONGER- TO MANUALLY SEARCH THROUGH A DATABASE OF SOMETIMES IS MINIS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BOOKING PHOTOS. PUT UP WANTED POSTERS SAN MEDIAN NOTICES TO TRY AND IDENTIFY SUSPECTS. WE'VE USE TOOLS LIKE POLICE SKETCH ARTIST- TO SKETCH. BASED ON DESCRIPTIONS THAT WERE GIVEN BY I WITNESSES IN VICTIMS SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN THESE. I WITNESSES ARE VICTIMS WERE WERE STILL IN A STATE OF SHOCK TRAUMA DISTRESS. OR CONFUSION- AND IN SOME INSTANCES. AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND NOT LAPD BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY- DEPARTMENT OF HIRED CRIME FIGHTING PSYCHICS- IN IN AND I DON'T I DON'T MEAN ANY OFFENSE TO THESE PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE SERVED OUR PROFESSION BUT- THEY ARE PART OF THE STORY. OF WHY POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS PERHAPS MAY HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN AS POSITIVE. WHEN WE LOOK AT I WITNESS CALLS WHEN WE LOOK IN AN INSTANT WHEN I WITNESS CALLS IN A DESCRIPTION OF A PERPETRATOR LET'S JUST SAY BLACK SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD FIVE NINE BLUE JEANS BLACK SHOES TATTOO ON THE ARM IN THE NECK- AND YOU KNOW THE OFFICERS PATROLLING LAPD'S SEVENTY SEVENTH DIVISION- WHICH FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW. WOULD BE CONSIDERED- THE OLD SOUTH CENTRAL BETTER YET. WITH OUR DISTINGUISHED ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM THE EAST VALLEY LET'S JUST SAY IT'S FOOTHILL DIVISION ARE AND WILL CHANGE BLACK TO LATINO. EVERY OTHER KID ON THE BLOCK IS A POTENTIAL SUSPECT. AND WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MANY POTENTIAL SUSPECTS. SUSPECTS EXCUSE ME COMMUNITIES BEGIN TO FEEL OVER POLICED EVEN IF THE POLICE WORK IS WELL INTENTIONED- AND IN RESPONSE TO LEGITIMATE THREATS NOW FORTUNATELY WE'VE BEEN IN AND A TIME OF TRANSITION FOR A LITTLE WHILE. LAPD IS A PART OF A CONSORTIUM THAT IS THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGIONAL IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM AND I KNOW THERE'S A REPRESENTATIVE HERE IN THE OFFICE AUDIENCE FROM WHAT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO LACK CHRIS. IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY. BUT LACK CHRIS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF ALL SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN THE COUNTY. IT'S A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP INCLUDES- TOTAL SIXTY FOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT SOCI. NOT ASSOCIATION EXCUSE ME AGENCIES IN THE COUNTY. LACK CHRIS PROVIDES FACIAL RECOGNITION SEARCH CAPABILITIES TO THESE AGENCIES UPON REQUEST INCLUDING LAPD. WE AND WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN INCLUDE LACK OR SEEN HERE. WE DO NOT USE FACIAL RECOGNITION IN REAL TIME WE UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY AFTER THE FACT TO GENERATE ACCURATE INVESTIGATIVE LEADS. NO JUDGE WILL GIVE US A WARRANT NO D. A. R. WILL BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST SOMEONE SOLELY ON THE GROUNDS OF A POSSIBLE FACIAL RECOGNITION MATCH. LAW ENFORCEMENT USE OF THIS FACIAL RECOGNITION IN TECH LA COUNTY. IS LIMITED TO SEARCHES OF BOOKING PHOTOS IN THE CRIMINAL DATABASES THAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING LAW- AND AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IS FAR AS LA COUNTY IS CONCERNED IN PREDOMINATELY ACROSS STATE ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS. WE RUN FACIAL RECOGNITION SEARCHES ON BOOKING DATA CONTAINED IN CRIMINAL OFFENDER REGISTRIES- AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS OR CONNECTIVE ITTY TO DMV RECORDS- AND LACK CHRIS DOES NOT UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA DATABASES OR OTHER OPEN SOURCE PLATFORMS. THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE CRIMINAL DATABASES THAT REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN. ARM WE ONLY REALLY MATCHED. TO CRIMINAL DATABASE BOOKING PHOTOS AT THE PRESENT TIME BECAUSE THE IDENTITIES OF THE IN THE INDIVIDUALS ARE KNOWN WITH BIOMETRICS THAT ARE CAPTURED AT THE TIME OF BOOKING AND SORT OF MARY TO THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION SO WE CAN MATCH AGAIN TO VERIFY WHO THEY ARE- WITH SOCIAL MEDIA WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS AND CAREFUL. BECAUSE OF THE NUMEROUS FAKE ACCOUNTS AND OTHER TYPES OF- HE INTERESTING ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR ON ON SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT OPEN SOURCE SOLUTIONS LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA ARE NOT POSSIBLE BUT I THINK WHAT- IT DEMONSTRATES HOPEFULLY TO THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL CAUTIOUS ON SELF REGULATE AS WE WAY THE VERY SAME FACTORS THAT YOU ALL STATED THAT YOU WERE WANTING. AS FAR AS THE FUTURE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION ARE CONCERNED I MEAN THAT'S IN MANY IN IN MANY INSTANCES IT'S GOING TO BE- DEPENDING UPON. HOW THE TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES IN IN HOW IT. IT IS FIT FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF USE. THE ONE THING THOUGH THAT I WILL RAISE TO YOUR ATTENTION IS WE HAVE THE OLYMPICS COMING UP VERY SOON. IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. AND IT'S WORTH CON TEMPLATING IN THAT TYPE OF SETTING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF THREATS- TO THE COUNTRY TO THE NATION- TO WHAT EXTENT WE EMPLOY THAT AND OTHER TYPE OF BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES. IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND SURROUNDING AREAS SAFE. AS FAR AS- THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE'S PRIMARY INTEREST IN FILL OUT CO PRIMARY WILL CALL IT INTERESTING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. OUTSIDE OF THE OLYMPICS EASY YOU KNOW REDUCING CRIME IS A PART OF IT BUT- WE SEE TRUE VALUE IN FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. ARM HELPING WITH THE PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE TO BRING THE RIGHT PERSON TO JUSTICE AND TO REDUCE HUMAN ERROR THAT LEADS TO FLAWED INVESTIGATIONS. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT FOR EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO THE INNOCENCE PROJECT WHICH IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM GROUP THAT. SAYS IT'S COMMITTED TO EXONERATING WRONGFULLY CONVICTED PEOPLE OF ONE OF THE STATS THAT THEY THEY HAVE A OF REFERENCED MULTIPLE TIMES THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT PEOPLE CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE HAVE BEEN EXONERATED. OF THESE 71% HAD BEEN CONVICTED THROUGH WHAT I'LL CALL I WITNESS MISIDENTIFICATION. AND IT SERVED AN AVERAGE OF FOURTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE EXONERATION. OF THOSE FALSE IDENTIFICATIONS 41% INVOLVED CROSS RACIAL MISIDENTIFICATION. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THAT I- HAD JUST MENTIONED WERE BLACK. SO WE ASK THE QUESTION WHEN WE APPROACH SORT OF FUTURE USES IN AND OUR EVEN OUR CURRENT USAGE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. WITH HIGH DEFINITION IMAGERY AND FACIAL LOW JUST SAY TOP TIER FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES. COULD THE FATE OF THESE MOSTLY BLACK MEN HAVE CHANGED COULD THESE TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS HAVE. REDIRECTED LAW ENFORCEMENT ENERGIES TO THE ACTUAL PERPETRATORS INSTEAD OF TWO INNOCENT MEN WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN PROXIMITY TO THE CRIME OF THE CRIME SCENE- IN OUR MIND THERE'S NOTHING WORSE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE THAN. US UTILIZING TAXPAYER RESOURCES TO PURSUE DETAIN ARREST INCARCERATE PROSECUTE AND CONVICT SOMEONE THAT WE WEREN'T EVEN REALLY TRYING TO CATCH IN RAISING THIS ISSUE. AND WE WONDER WHAT THE ROLE IS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN FACILITATING SORT OF A MORE EVEN RACIALLY JUST JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT DRASTICALLY LOWERS ARM MIS IDENTIFICATIONS HOW DO WE UTILIZE IT TO BE MORE PRECISE ACCURATE WITH OUR ACTIVITIES- SO THAT WE DON'T GET ACCUSED OF THINGS LIKE. OVER POLICING. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE EVEN BASELESS ALLEGATIONS YOU KNOW AFFECT PERCEPTIONS OF OUR WORK- HOW DO WE LEVERAGED THE TECHNOLOGIES MYCOLOGIST MENTIONED TO DEAL WITH THE THOUSAND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MISSING ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO TENSOF THOUSANDS. OF MISSING CHILDREN WERE NOT FULLY THERE YET IN LA COUNTY BUT IT IS IT IS TOP OF CONSCIENCE WILL PUT IT THAT WAY- FIFTEEN HERE BEING THAT WE WANT TO PREVENT CRIMES WANNA SOLVE CRIMES WE REALLY REUNITE MISSING PERSONS WE WANT TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY POOL. SERVE IN CAP. REDUCE X. IT UNNECESSARY EXPERIENCES WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND INCREASE COMMUNITY CONFIDENCE. ARM I'LL CONCLUDE WITH- TOUCHING ON A COUPLE OF THE POINTS IN IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED- WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE- PROPAGANDA ASSOCIATED WITH- THE WITH THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. MANY OF YOUR WHERE IT'S EASY YOU ALL OF CITED IT MISSED THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY THEY REGULARLY EVALUATE THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN THEIR MOST RECENT REPORT RELEASED ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO. THEY EVALUATED TWO HUNDRED RHYTHMS FROM NINETY NINE DEVELOPERS WHICH COMPRISES A MAJORITY OF THE INDUSTRY- AND THIS IS GLOBALLY. MANY OF THEIR ALGORITHMS THAT THE- TESTED DID DISPLAY SOME BIAS. AND YOU KNOW NEW SET NEWS OUTLETS YOU KNOW TOOK THAT TO WRITE THEIR THEIR THEIR STORIES TO BASICALLY CONCLUDE THAT ALL FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE WAS THE SAME IN ALL FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE WAS IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM RACIST OR SEXIST- BUT IF YOU PAY YOUR INSIDE THE REPORT. IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT AS MY **** MENTION THE MOST ACCURATE ALGORITHMS HAD DO HAVE UNDETECTABLE- DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AND IT'S STILL WORTH STATING IN OUR OPINION THAT. ARM WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU CONTRAST THE ACCURACY. OF EVEN THE MID TIER NOT THAT WE WOULD EVEN WANT TO APPROACH YOUR MID TIER TECHNOLOGIES BUT IF YOU IF YOU CONTRAST MID TIER TECHNOLOGIES WITH. THE HISTORIC PRACTICES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. BOMB THOSE MID TIER TECHNOLOGIES ARE INFINITELY MORE ACCURATE THAN OUR OLD SCHOOL WAYS SO THAT'S WHY OF MISTER CHAIRMAN WHEN THE FICTITIOUS CLAIM STARTED LAST YEAR ALLEGE THAT. 20% OF LEGISLATORS HAD BEEN MISIDENTIFIED. IT IMMEDIATELY IT PROVOKED- I THINK A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON OUR SIDE THAT WE ATTEMPTED TO DIALOGUE ABOUT BUT UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T HAVE A WILLING RECIPIENT DIALOGUE- WHERE DID YOU SET THE ACCURACY THRESHOLDS FOR THE SOFTWARE. WHAT WAS THE POLICY OF THE IMAGES OF THE LEGISLATORS THAT YOU USE. ARM WHAT WAS THE QUALITY OF THESE. MYSTERIOUS PUBLIC DATABASE THAT YOU UTILIZE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT CRIMINAL OFFENDER RECORD INFORMATION- IS CONFIDENTIAL IS ONLY USED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES SO. AND WE CAN VOUCH FOR THE QUALITY OF THE DATA THAT IS INSERTED INTO THAT SYSTEM WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DATABASE THAT WAS USED ARM WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE METHODOLOGY. DID RECEIVE IT TO THOSE QUESTIONS AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY. ARM DID WE USE TOP TIER FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND ALGORITHMS- AS JUDGE BY NEST OR DID WE SOMETHING ELSE SO. EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT LET'S JUST SAY HYPOTHETICALLY ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGIES. ARM WERE 20% INACCURATE FOR THIS HYPOTHETICAL IF WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE 71% MISIDENTIFICATION NUMBER- OF THOSE WHO ARE FALSELY ACCUSED AND SENTENCED. TO DEATH ARM OR OUR HYPOTHETICAL 20% ARM IF WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS THIS FALSE HYPOTHETICAL TO CUT THE NUMBER OF WRONGLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE BUT MORE THAN 65% WE WOULD JUST ASK THE QUESTION WHY THE STATUS QUO. I THINK FORTUNATELY FOR YOU ALL YOU DON'T TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A FALSE DICHOTOMY THERE ARE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS OF BILLABLE THAT MUCH ACCURATE ARM WE SEE THIS AS AN IN THE GATE OF TOOL OUT THAT'LL LEAD US TO THE RIGHT INVEST IF PASSED THE TECHNOLOGY BY ITSELF. ARMED IS NOT GIVE US PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE AGREED TO IN A MINUTE TO BE PLACED IN THE LAW I SEE THAT. THE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD WILL NOT IN AND OF IT DOUBLES PROBABLE CAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT REAL INVESTIGATIVE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE- WE HAVE TO PROVE TO A JURY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT- IN IN THAT IS ALL THE A COMPASS THAT I HAVE HERE TODAY AVAILABLE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU REYES OF LEGITIMATE QUESTION MY HOPE IS OUT MAYBE THE P. R. PALETTE THE NEXT TWO PANELS WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUES. AND WITHOUT THAT I LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE LOOK AT THE SERVICE RIGHT. THANK YOU- FOR A YEAR PRESENTATIONS OF I YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES JUST RECENTLY YOU KNOW- WE'VE HEARD FROM YOU KNOW OF THE EITHER THROUGH RESEARCHER NEWS ARTICLES ABOUT THE USE OF F. R. T. AND LONG LONG PRESSMAN INSECURITY AND NOW ESPECIALLY WITH- THE- IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE LIKE READING OR ANY TYPE OF THING AT THEIR DOOR PEOPLE ARE YOU IN A MINUTE. YOU KNOW WHAT SOCIAL MEDIA I. DEV IS HOW. DO YOU HOW DO YOU THINK OR DO YOU THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE ABLE. TO LOOK THROUGH- YOU KNOW SUBSCRIBE TO SOME TYPE OF SERVICE. THAT COULD HELP IDENTIFY. SOMEONE THAT'S ACCUSED OF A CRIME THAT YOU HAVE A PHOTO OR VIDEO OF OR HOW DO YOU THINK THAT COULD HAVE YOU THOUGHT THROUGH THAT LIKE- I MEAN WE IT THANK YOU I'M- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WE START THROUGH A- LOT OF. AERIALS I'M CERTAIN PHILOSOPHIC BE. ARM HOW MUCH OR OR OR WHAT USES DO YOU APPLYING FACIAL RECOGNITION- TECHNOLOGIES TO AND- I MEAN ULTIMATELY. IF WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER WHAT WHAT WE BELIEVE. PUBLIC OPINION WHERE PUBLIC OPINION STANDS WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS US TO DO- WHEN WE TAKE. COMPLAINTS FROM- WILL CALL MARK CUSTOMERS YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARM WE VERY MUCH WE VERY MUCH WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ISSUE THAT THEY HAVE. AND STE D. STAND THERE ARE TOOLS AVAILABLE THAT ARE ACCURATE THE BILL AGAIN PLUS FOLKS IN. ON GOING DOWN RIGHT INVESTIGATIVE PATHS WHAT THAT MEANS FOR IS THAT WE SPEND MUCH LESS TIME. THE I DON'T SEE ANTAGONIZES BUT POLICE WORK THAT IS THAT IS BOTHERS SOME OF SOMEONE'S YOU KNOW RIGHTS IN THEIR LIBERTIES IN ORDER TO FOCUS DOWN ON GETTING TO THE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ISSUES THAT WE WOULD HAND. SO I'VE FROM THE LAPD YUN PERSON. WE'RE WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED X. ALL THE TOOLS THAT ARE ARE LOOK AVAILABLE AT LEGITIMATE TOOLS ACCURATE TOOL. THAT WAS THE ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AT THAT PARTICULARLY FROM AND I GUESS YOU KNOW BASED ON WHAT YOU SPONSORED I'M THINKING WHO. DID HE MEAN LET ME THIS QUESTION ALL OF US WHO IS TO DETERMINE WHERE THESE ALLEGED TOOLS TO BE IS THAT OF FOR RIGHT THEY SHOULD IS AT THE STATE FEDERAL COOPER. I'M JUST CARE FROM YOUR. WHAT IS. THE LOW FOR AND- I DIDN'T ON I THINK THUS FAR YET NOT FAR WE WE'VE DIFFER TO ARM THE COUNTY IN A WAY. LACK CHRIS AS AN ORGAN. TO SORT OF THAT BUT I THINK TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ARM. AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED EARLIER WHAT WE WOULDN'T BE OPPOSED TO THAT REALLY BEING A PART OF THE PROCURE PROCESS. LET'S PER THE BEST TAKE ON THE FOR END LET'S. THEIR ADVANTAGES TO. WERE BENEFITS THAT THEY AND THEN FROM THERE SO THAT WE KNOW- AND IT'S DISTILLED DOWN TO YOU KNOW THE OFFICERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE- AND CIVILIANS PERHAPS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR UTILIZING THESE TECHNOLOGIES- JUST WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE GETTING. AT WHAT WHAT WE CAN REALLY I ON IN WE UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE NUANCES ABOUT- WAYS IN WHICH YOU KNOW NOT TO USE THE SOFTWARE I MEAN FOR FROM MOST ALL OF THESE SOFTWARE PROGRAM I MEAN YOU DO NEED TO BE TO ON. YOU DO NEED TO I NEED THE PARKS NEED THIS POLICY. OUR DO NEED TO OBVIOUSLY INTO THE TO BE A ACCORDANCE WITH EXIST LAW BUT THEY DO HE SAID THE MURDERS WE- WERE VERY MUCH. THE LADY MEANT HE- WE HAVE WE HAVE THE LAYERS OF REGULATION ARM THAT DON'T SPEAKS. ARM TO THE YOU OF FACIAL TECH BUT OVER ARCHING SORT OF GUY THE USE- IN THE THINKING BEHIND SOME OF THE LOCAL REGULATIONS THAT WE'VE PROMULGATED FOR THE USE OF METRICS. VERY MUCH MISSED KILEY AS HAS QUESTION. MR APURVA SO IN THAT EXAMPLES. REALLY ONE. ABOUT HAITIAN ONE OF THE WRAPS THE LITTLE BALL WAS WE HAVE A NEW THE SHOWS ON A STORE IS BASED UPON THE FACE OF A AND READ AND THAT. THANKS FOR THE A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE. IF SO IN A WAY THAT. WE ARE A THAT. YEAH I MEAN SO THE PERSONAL AS YET THAT YOU RAISE THE RAISE A GOOD A GOOD QUESTION I THINK FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT OLD THAT'S A LONG FOR ACTIVITY IT'S A PRIVATE PROPERTY BUT ALSO SO OBVIOUSLY THE NEEDS TO BE PROCESS THAT HAVE THERE MINOR. IS MOST DOES THE RETAIL SECTOR LAW PREVENTION PROGRAM THAT DO DO KEEP TRACK THE OF PEOPLE THIS IS BASS LIKE AN ADDITION TO WHAT THERE ARE DOING BUT THE EXAM I'VE SEEN OF YOU PAUL'S FOR THIS TO ASSIST. THERE IS A VERY. WE THOUGHT OUT PROCESS FOR ATTY SOME OF LIKE THE REST OF U. K. FILE SB VERIFY BY SERB LAYERS OF IT OF A MISS. YOU KNOW WITHIN THE WITHIN THE COMPANY HAS TO BE A OR B. METHOD FOR SOMEONE TO OUR RE AND FROM THE WAY LEAST BEING PUT ON A LIST LIKE THAT IN THAT'S OF THE BEST PRACTICES AND AREA OF SEEN BUT REALLY ANY TO BE NEED THIRTY TO BE STRUCK ON THAT FOR SURE. MR. THAT IT IS FAR AS LONG INNER WHICH SAY IN RETAIL SETTING ON MY COLLEAGUES IS IT RIGHT LOS PREVENT LAWS PREVENT DOES THAT AND THE OPERA. THAT WE'VE HAD TO SORT OF PEER BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF THE THAT THAT DOES HAVE YOU KNOW YOU WALK THE DOOR IN LOS PREVENTION THEY FOLLOW YOU THROUGH STORE THEY DOING MAYBE IN SOME BLOW IN SOME CASES THEY BE TO IT BE BE OF CAN BIAS BUT AT THE END THESE THESE HUMAN. SORT OF DOING SO IS A AS WE YOU SUGGEST MIGHT SAN A THERE'S AN REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT THE STATUS. WE IS WHAT YOU SAY IN A SCENARIO THAT IS PRIME. HE DRIVEN IS WORSE. RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK THE TWO GENTLEMEN FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SAID LET'S BRING UP OUR NEXT PANEL. AND FOR OUR NEXT PANEL I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR OUR THIRD PANEL JOINING US TODAY IS MEGAN GRAHAM WHO IS CLINICAL SUPERVISING ATTORNEY AT THE SAM HOUSTON LAW TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC POLICY CLINIC. AT UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW ARE ALSO UNFORTUNATELY MATT KEY GOAL TECHNOLOGY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES ATTORNEY AT THE A. C. L. U. OF CALIFORNIA ORIGINALLY LISTED ON THE AGENDA THAT WENT OUT THERE COULD NOT JOIN IS TO DATE. BUT JOINING AS A IS BECCA MALL. LEGISLATIVE CORN AND HOW A KID AT THE- I CAL. TO DISCUSS THE TOPIC PRIVACY BY AS AND OTHER CHALLENGES FOR TO THE USE OF FACIAL TECHNOLOGY SO WELCOME AND BEFORE YOU LIKE FOR YOU TO STATE YOUR NAY FOR THE RECORD PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR ME TO SPEAK THIS. MY NAME IS MIKE. AN JUST SAT A CLINICAL SUPERVISING ATTORNEY IN THE SAME IN LAW TECHNO IN PUBLIC POLICY. UPPER LAW. MY WORK IN THE CLINIC FOCUSES THE INNER OF TECH. AND CRIMINAL LAW FOR USE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY DURING AN- I'VE DONE SIX SUBS AND WORK ON HOW LONG ENFORCEMENT IN VARIOUS. USE FACIAL. TECH AND HOW IT AFFECTS CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS CASES. TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE. ON HOW FACIAL. IS MOST COMMONLY USED IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS THE DIFFERENT DIFFICULT CHALLENGES DEFENDANTS FACE IF THEY FIND OUT THAT IT THAT IT HAS BEEN USING THEIR CASE. AND QUITE FRANKLY THAT'S A BIG F. AT THIS POINT. IN PRACTICE LAW ENFORCEMENT USES THE TECHNOLOGY TO COMPARE WHAT IS KNOWN AS A PRO PHOTO TO A DATA SET OF FACES WHOSE IDENTITIES ARE KNOWN. THE PRO FOR IT WAS A PICTURE OF AN UNKNOWN INDIVIDUAL THE PICTURE CAN BE FROM A WITNESSES PHONE- PICTURE THAT THEY TALK A SECURITY CAMERA OR ANOTHER SOURCE. THE KNOWN DATA SIDE IS DETERMINED BY WHOSE PICTURES THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CAN ACCESS DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION. THE DATA SET MAY INCLUDE DRIVER'S LICENSE AND IDENTIFICATION CARD PHOTOS MUGSHOTS OR AS WE'VE LEARNED RECENTLY I'M IN THE- REVELATIONS ABOUT CLEARVIEW A. I. AT THE PHOTOS. MAY IN THE DATA SET CAN BE SCRAPED FROM ALL ACROSS THE INTERNET WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. IN NEW YORK AS AN EXAMPLE CHILDREN'S ARREST PHOTOS HAVE BEEN INCLUDE THE AND WHAT BECAUSE- AS HAVE SO. MUGSHOT THAT WERE PER. BY LAW FROM BEING USED FOR. LAWN FOR PURPOSES. TO BE CLEAR. THE DISK ABOUT TO GET REALIZE INTO SOME. THAT PROBE WERE OF. DEPENDING ON THE SEARCH. A PERSON MAY HAVE A FIRST AND FOURTH AMENDMENT CLAIM THAT WOULD MAKE THE INITIAL COLLECTION OF THE PHOTO UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SO BEFORE RUNNING A SEARCH LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST ENSURE THAT THE PROBE PHOTO WILL LEAD TO A VIABLE RISK MATCH. PRO PHOTOS ARE GENERALLY TAKEN UNDER LESS THAN IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES THEY MAY BE BLURRY THEY CAN BE TAKEN AND ANGLE THE LIGHTING MAY BE BAD THE PERSON'S EYES MIGHT BE CLOSED OR THEIR FACE MIGHT BE OBSCURED ALL OF THESE SORTS OF ISSUES MAKE THE SOFTWARE LESS ACCURATE. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL REGULARLY MANIPULATE PRO PHOTOS SO THE SOFTWARE IS MORE LIKELY TO FIND A MATCH AND IN DOING SO- POLICE MAY INTRODUCED BY A SEIZE OR INACCURACIES INTO THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. FOR EXAMPLE IF OMEONE'S EYES ARE CLOSED AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ADDS EYES TO THE PICTURE THEY HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT COLOR EYES THE ACTUAL PERSON IN THE PHOTO HAS. THEN LAW ENFORCEMENT RUNS THE SEARCH. WHETHER AN AGENT MUST BE TRAINED AND WHAT TRAINING IS APPROPRIATE MAYBE STEP BY POLICY REGULATION IT MAY ALSO NOT BE. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR VARIOUS TECHNICAL THRESHOLD FOR DEFINING A MATCH. AND FOR WHICH CRIMES FACIAL RECOGNITION CAN BE USED TO DURING THE INVESTIGATION. THE SOFTWARE COMPARES THE PRO PHOTO TO THE DATA SET OF KNOWN FACES I DESCRIBED AS OTHERS WELL AND HAVE DISCUSSED THE ALGORITHMS CURRENTLY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ACCURATE FOR FOLKS IN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING FOR WOMEN COMPARED TO MEN. FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DARK SKIN COMPARED TO LIGHT SKIN AND PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AS COMPARED TO ADULTS. ONCE THE SEARCH HAS BEEN RUN THE ALGORITHM WILL PROVIDE A SET OF POTENTIAL MATCHES WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONFIDENCE OR LIKELIHOOD THAT THE PROBE PHOTO MATCHES UNKNOWN PHOTO. THE SOFTWARE DOES NOT PROVIDE ONE TO ONE PERFECT MATCHES SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT WILL EXAMINE THE RESULTS TO DECIDE WHO IS THE BEST MATCH. THE PERSON THE SOFTWARE PLACES AT THE TOP OF THE LIST IS NOT ALWAYS THE PERSON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER DECIDES IS THE BEST MATCH. FROM THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT AS ANY NUMBER OF THINGS DEPENDING ON THE CASE APPLICABLE RECORD REGULATIONS IF ANY AND WHO THE PROBE PHOTO IS UP. FOR AMBLE IF THE PRO PHOTO IS OF A SUB FACT AND REGULATE PERMIT IT POLICE MAY USE APPS TO CREATE A OR LINE UP TO SHOW AN EYE WITNESS. ELSEWHERE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE SIMPLY A WITNESS TO ASK THE PERSON MAY HAVE A- THROUGH FACIAL. IS SUSPECT. AND IN YET. STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN DOES YOU WILL RECOGNITION TO IDENTIFY. WHO WERE UNWILLING TO COME FOR. OR TO IDENTIFY SOME WHO'S QUOTE UNABLE TO EIGHT HIM OR HER. WITH CAN NO BOUNCE. I'M ASSUMING FACIAL. IS YOU TO CHEN AND I. I'D LAW FORCED MAY EVER OF DEFENSE. IT'S MORE THAN JUST THIS POINT. FACIAL RECOGNITION MAYBE YOU. AND PARKS AND LIFE IS M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY&lt;/c&gt;</u> THAT MAY NEVER KNOW. DEPENDING PROTECT THEIR CONCERT YOU RIGHTS COURT IF THEY NEVER FIND OUT WHAT THE POLICE DID DURING THE- EVEN IF THE DEFENDANT FIND OUT THAT OR- WAS. TO LAUNCH MAY REFER TO SHARE AND ABOUT THE SEARCH. SO FAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY PROSECUTORS HAVE OFTEN REFUSED TO SHARE BASIC INFORMATION LIKE WHETHER AND HOW THE PRO PHOTO WAS MANIPULATED. HOW MANY POTENTIAL MATCHES THE PROGRAM IDENTIFIED HOW THE SCORE OF THE DEFENDANT COMPARED TO THE OTHER POTENTIAL MATCHES FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE TECHNICAL AND ACCURACY TESTING OF SOFTWARE WHERE IT'S BEING USED. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS ARGUABLY BRADY MATEER ALL THE DEFENDANT HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT NOW. IT IS INHERENTLY EITHER INCULPATORY OR EXCULPATORY AND BRADY VERSUS MARYLAND AND ITS PROGENY REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION. HOWEVER AT THE EXACT THE EXISTING PRESSURES TO PLEASE. AND THE SO CALLED SENTENCING TAXES DEFENDANTS REGULARLY FACE IF THEY GO TO TRIAL OR CHOOSE TO LITIGATE PRETRIAL ISSUES LIKE THIS. I MEAN IF YOU COURTS OF HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT EXISTING CAPS LOCK YOUR KEYS IN. RIGHT TO KNOW THIS AND ACTION. FURTHERMORE BECAUSE THE FOR RECOGNITION. ARE NOT CURRENT BEING INTO DIRECTLY AS- OF A POSITIVE I. COURTS HAVE NOT HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER FACIAL RECOGNITION IS RELIABLE EVIDENCE OF A CRIME. OR ANY SORT QUITE FRANKLY A FRY HEARING NORMALLY GIVES COURTS THE CHANCE TO TEST THE RELIABILITY OF EVIDENCE BUT AGAIN BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT SO FAR GENERALLY CONCEDES THE FACIAL RECOGNITION. RESULTS CANNOT BE INTRODUCED DIRECTLY THOSE HEARINGS ARE NOT BEING HELPED. SO THE LEGAL MECHANISMS WE GENERALLY ASSUME ARE IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS ARE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO RELY ON WHEN IT COMES TO FACIAL RECOGNITION. THE DEFENDANT CANNOT ARGUE HER RIGHTS HAVE BEEN HARMED BY FACIAL RECOGNITION IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT WAS USED BRADY CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SLOW IN COMING AS A RESULT OF THE LACK OF INFORMATION CHAIRED BY PROSECUTORS. AND MAY NOT PRESENT. LET'S FIVE THE OFFICIAL RESULTS AS I'VE BECAUSE FORCE CAN CHOOSE SHIELD THE TECHNOLOGY FROM QUEST BY IN FOR ONLY THE I WOULD I DONE IT EVENTUALLY. THESE WE COMPLEX ARE NOT EASY TO FIX EVEN THEY MAY SEEM LIKE SIMPLE FIXES THEY'RE INTERLOCKING AND THE KNOCK ON EFFECTS OF A SOLUTION TO ONE WILL AFFECT. AS A DID YOU DEVELOP MORE PRINT LEGAL NEW ONES ARE LIKELY TO ARISE. THIS I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALLEGE THE LAW. TO TAKE TIME AND CARE TO CRAFT A REGULATORY REGIME BUT ADEQUATELY SAFEGUARDS CALIFORNIANS CIVIL LIBERTIES AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. I'M FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SIMPLY COMES WITH TOO MANY RISKS TO CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS RIGHTS FOR USE WHILE THAT FRAMEWORK IS BEING DEVELOPED. THERE RISKS OF MISIDENTIFICATION BIAS AND INADEQUATE TESTING OF THE RELIABILITY OF THE RESULTS AMONG OTHERS THAT I'M SURE FOLKS WILL TALK ABOUT ON THE NEXT PANEL. LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO ITS JOB SO FAR WITHOUT USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND OF COURSE THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND BIAS THAT ARE INTRODUCED BY I WITNESSED TECHNOLOGY- EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATIONS. ON THEIR OWN HOWEVER THE COURTS HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE FOR DEFENDANTS TO BE ABLE TO VINDICATE THEIR RIGHTS. IT IS MY VIEW THAT WE THAT PERSON CAN WAIT A LONGER WILL LEAD TO DECIDE THE IMPROVE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS ARE. TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU MUCH NEXT. PLEASE HI THANK YOU THE ARE. TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS BECCA KRAMER MATTER AND I'M LEGISLATIVE COORDINATOR AN ADVOCATE AT THE ACLU CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THREE KEY ISSUES WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND MY TESTIMONY THIS AFTERNOON. FIRST I DID AND REAL THREAT THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION POSES TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THESE SYSTEMS CAN AND- BEING A- BY ORAL GOVERNMENT. INCLUDING I. TO TARGET PEOPLE OF. IMMIGRANTS IN POLITICAL ACTIVE. MORE IT. NESS NOW PREVENT FURTHER HARM. SECOND THE UNIQUE AND SO FOR THAT FACE RECOGNITION POSES TO OUR BAY. CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. FACIAL SAYS GENERATE ON THE DENTED. ON RENT PURSE SIR. AND EXPLAIN. GOT AND CREATION. THIS DANGEROUS. CAN BE YOU TO I BASIC OPPORTUNE. AND TO PROMOTE DISC. AND MARCH. HELLO CAN. THIRD I WANT THIS IMPORT PROTECTING WILL MOVE PREVENT DEPLOYMENT BACK BY. RIGHT CAN BE AND A THE UNITED. ARE STEPPING UP TO PER CIVIL RIGHTS AND PUBLIC SAFETY BY ADOPTING. ON FACE BACK USE BY GOV. FISHER RECOGNITION GET COVER UNIQUE POWER TO SPY ON US WHEREVER WE GO IDENTIFYING US THAT PROTESTS POLITICAL RALLIES PLACES OF WORSHIP AND MORE. THIS TECHNOLOGY SUPER CHARGES THE GOVERNMENT'S EXISTING ABUSIVE PRACTICES FROM TERRORIZING IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES TO SPYING ON BLACK AND BROWN ACTIVISTS. THIS POWER ISN'T JUST BEING ABUSED IN CHINA WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS USING IT TO TRACK AND CONTROL MUSLIMS AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE REPORTED THE USE FACIAL RECOGNITION TO IDENTIFY PROTESTERS FOR VAST AND POWERFUL SYSTEMS LIKE CLEAR VIEW A I CAN USE OUR SPECIAL MEDIA PHOTOS. TO SECRETLY RECORD OUR LOCATIONS AND WHO WE MEET. FACIAL RECOGNITION. THREATENS THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ICE HAS DEMANDED THAT MARYLAND AND WASHINGTON TO STATES THAT LIKE CALIFORNIA OFFERED DRIVERS LICENSES TOP UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. RUN FACIAL RECOGNITION SEARCHES ON THEIR STATE DATABASES SYSTEMS BELTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE VULNERABLE TO THESE SAME DEMANDS. FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ARE BEING USED TO JUSTIFY A REST AND ARE DEEPLY FLAWED CIRCUMSTANCES. POLICE HAVE FED THE SYSTEMS FORENSICS SKETCHES PHOTOS OF CELEBRITIES AND AS WE JUST HEARD ABOUT IT IT IT- IMAGES IN AN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE. WE KNOW THE DANGER AND THEIR EMINA. THAT IS WHAT THE ACLU ARE STILL RIGHTS. BELIEVE ANY LEAD ADDRESSING FACIAL. SHOULD CLOSE THE DOOR TO WIDESPREAD USE THE FACIAL RASH GOODNESS OF MY HEALTH. THE LEGISLATURE CAN AND SHOULD AND A MORE. ON THE GOVERNMENT USE OFFICIAL. THE ACLU AND OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ALLIES ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT THIS LEGISLATURE MY AUTHORIZED THE GOVERNMENT ME TO USE FACIAL. TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE AS WELL AS JOBS FINANCIAL SERVICES EMPLOYMENT AND EVEN BASIC NECESSITIES WITH LITTLE OR IF ANY DETERRENCE AND THIS IS NOT JUST A THEORETICAL. FOR INSTANCE AGENCIES AND STATES INCLUDING MICHIGAN AND NEW YORK ARE CURRENTLY TRYING TO ADD FACIAL RECOGNITION SEC KNOWLEDGE A SYSTEMS TO PUBLIC HOUSING. SOME FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ARE A HUNDRED TIMES MORE LIKELY TO MISS IDENTIFY A PERSON WHO IS BLACK OR OF ASIAN DESCENT ARE KNOWN TO MISS GENDER PEOPLE AND AT HIGHER RATES PRESIDENT OF THE- FOR WOMEN. USING MISSION IN PUBLIC HOUSING WOULD LEAD TO BEING DONE ACCESS PUBLIC HOUSING EVEN TO THEIR OWN HOME IF SUCH A SYSTEM DEPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA MISS IDENTIFIES THEM. FACIAL RECOGNITION COULD ALSO BE IS TONIGHT OTHER SERVICES TO PEOPLE DEEMED UNDESIRABLE BY COMPANIES OR TO PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE THIS PEOPLE. BUSINESSES IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA EXAMPLE ARE ALREADY DEPLOYING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN SHARE LIST OF UNDESIRABLE PATRONS TO BARS AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS RIGHT NOW SOME HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN THE US ARE EXPLORING THE DEPLOYMENT OF. RECOGNITION IN HOSPICE AS WELL. THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH. TO PROVIDE AID ACCESS AND SERVICES AND NOT TO DENY THEM AND WHICH SHOULD BE PREVENTING THE DEPLOYMENT OF SYSTEMS THAT FACILITATE THE MISTREATMENT AND HARM AT THE HANDS OF GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESSES. CALIFORNIANS. 82% OF LIKELY TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA VOTERS DO NOT WANT TO BE MONITORED AND TRACKED BY THE GOVERNMENT THREE FACE OR OTHER BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE. CITIES IN COUNTY SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO ADDRESS THESE THREATS THROUGH LEGISLATION THAT REGULATES AND EVEN PROHIBITS THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION AND THEIR JURISDICTIONS. CALIFORNIA CITIES INCLUDING SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND AND BERKELEY HAVE ALL DONE EXACTLY THIS BY ADOPTING BANDS ON THE GOVERNMENT'S USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION. A COMMUNITY ACTING THROUGH ITS LOCAL DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SHOULD BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE DEPLOYMENT OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TO DENY PUBLIC HOUSING BASIC SERVICES OR OTHER USES I GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ACLU AND CIVIL RIGHTS ALLIES EXTRA EARNED THAT I JUST MIGHT TAKE STEP TO PREVENT HOLIDAYS FROM SEEING LOCAL FOR RECORD LAW INCLUDE BANDS. IN LOCAL GOT IT'S FROM BEING STRONG ACTIONS THEY GET CANCEL THE FACE. WOULD BE PLAINLY ANTI DEMOCRATIC THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD SUPPORT LOCAL EFFORTS TO PROTECT CIVIL RIGHTS FROM THE USE OF NEW SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES. TECHNOLOGY MOVES QUICKLY AND SOMETIMES IT CAN FEEL LIKE THE USES OF TECHNOLOGY ARE INEVITABLE BUT THAT'S NOT HOW ARE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WORKS WE ALONG WITH OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE THE POWER TO REJECT SURVEILLANCE THAT IS INVASIVE THAT WE KNOW WILL BE USED TO DISCRIMINATE AND THAT SUFFERS. SERIOUS CURACY AND BY SEES AGAINST FINANCE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE ACTING TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY AND TO PROTECT THE DISCRIMINATORY TARGETING OF MARGINALIZED CALIFORNIANS. THERE IS EXACTLY ONE WAY TO DO THAT BY PASSING A MORATORIUM NOW. THANK YOU FOR OF IT ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WITHOUT THE LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER NO THE CUP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LIKE TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. YOU KNOW I IT'S INTERESTING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ETHICAL RAMIFICATIONS OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY- I. YOU KNOW I THINK WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH. PHILOSOPHICALLY THE THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT ABOUT FRT THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE ARE BRING UP ISSUES THAT WE HAVEN'T FACED BEFORE SO- YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE ISSUES MY MIND IS WHETHER OR NOT THE PUBLIC HAS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY WHEN THEY'RE IN A- PLACE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE KNOW WANT TO STAND THAT FOR EXAMPLE BARKING AT HAVE A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA- THAT RECORDS THE PATRONS TO COME INTO THE BAR NO ONE IS SAYING THAT A BAR SHOULDN'T COOPERATE WITH OTHER BARS AND- SHARING A NO A LIST- YOU KNOW PICTURES OF KNOWN TROUBLEMAKERS SO THAT THE OTHER BARS- COULD POTENTIALLY. NOT ALLOW THE PEOPLE INTO THE ESTABLISHMENT SO I'M WONDERING YOU KNOW WHY WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS APPLICATION THAT JUST BECAUSE IT'S DONE IN AN AUTOMATED WAY MAKES YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE BEING IMPACTED. ENERGY LIKE. I'M I THINK THAT PART OF IT IS AN AUTOMATED WAY IF SOMEONE IS LOOKING AT SURVEILLANCE TAPES FOR EXAMPLE IT TAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE POWER TO SORT THROUGH THE HOURS OF TAPES TO TRY AND IDENTIFY EVERYONE IN THEM WARES FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY- ALLOWS FOLKS THAT TO HAPPEN IN REAL TIME QUICKLY WITHOUT A LOT OF STAFF POWER AND SO IT. AMPLIFIES THE ABILITY TO SURVEIL PEOPLE AND IDENTIFY THEM IN PRIVATE SPACES WHICH IS RIDICULOUSLY TROUBLING WHEN COMBINED WITH BLACK LISTS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO KNOW WHY THERE ON THOSE LISTS AND MIGHT- AND THAT THE FOLKS THAT CREATE THE LESS MIGHT ALSO NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHY SOMEONE WAS BLACKLISTED IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. WHY THAT THE ALGORITHM BEHIND THE TECHNOLOGY BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM NOW AND SOMEONE COULD BE BLACKLISTED FROM A BAR BASED ON A PICTURE THAT WAS TAKEN UP OUR NAKED PROTECT THE TRUTH YEARS AGO RIGHT- HOW. HAS ELEVEN THAT'S ALL OF A BIGGER AND IF I AM FOR EXAMPLE BLACKLISTED AT A BAR I AND YOU'RE THE PERSON NOT LETTING ME AND I COULD ASK YOU. AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY WE GOT YOUR PICTURE FROM THIS BAR AND THEY BLACKLISTED YOU AND I COULD GO TO THEM AND SAY. WHY WAS I. AND SOMEONE THERE WOULD KNOW THE ANSWER WHERE AS IF WE'RE RUNNING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IT COULD JUST BE THAT MY PHOTO WAS MISIDENTIFIED. AND FLAGGED AS SOMEONE WHO I'M NOT. AND THE PERSON RUNNING THE TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT KNOW THE ANSWER THEY WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU'RE DONE AND I KNOW. THAT WAS TRUE THIRTY YEARS AGO THE PERSON LOOKING AT THE PICTURE COULD HAVE MISIDENTIFIED YOU I'M JUST A- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH. THE THING THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY YOU KNOW ETHICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE APPLICATION OF TESTIS TECHNO. TO THE SOCIETAL NORMS WE'VE ESTABLISHED ALREADY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO LOOK AT A DIFFERENT EXAMPLE SO FOR EXAMPLE. I HAVE PHOTOS ARE ELDERLY AGAIN AT- PROTEST AND RALLIES WE SEE THEM ON THE NEWS CENTER- NO ONE IS SITTING THERE AT THE END OF FINE WHO EXACTLY IS IN EACH OTHER'S BUT IT'S WITH BASS. RECOGNITION IT IS POSSIBLE TO. FIND ANY THE PEOPLE. AND SO IT'S SCALE OF. THE THAT. THE. I MEAN I'M STRUCK WITH THIS OKAY SO IF THOUGHT SHE TO ATTACK A RALLY. YOU KNOW A- NO. THAT PHOTO BEFORE GRAY ARE BEING TO AT THE RALLY. I HAVE A REASONABLE LIKE. THAT SOMEONE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A PICTURE. AND I DO. THAT I WAS AT THAT RALLY RIGHT THAT WAS TRUE THIRTY YEARS AGO IT'S TRUE NOW. YOU KNOW I'VE GIVEN UP THEIR EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY BY GOING TO A RALLY THE PUBLIC PLACE. SO I MEAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT. FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OTHER THAN IT'S EASIER NOW THAN IT USED TO BE. BUT I MEAN ETHICALLY THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TO BE DISTINCTION. I AM I WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR CLASSIFICATION OF GIVING UP THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY SIMPLY BY BEING OUT IN THE PUBLIC I THINK THAT THE CONSTITUTION IN. PARTICULAR THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. WHICH SPECIFICALLY LESS OUT THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. WOULD ALLOW FOR US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY EVEN WHEN WE ACCESS OUR HOUSE. OR IN PUBLIC SPACES. I MEAN THAT THAT'S THAT TO ME WHAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS THAT GOES TO THE HEART OF. YOU KNOW THE THIS PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING AND I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH. AS A SOCIETY OF YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. DIFFERENT AT IT BUT BUT I YOU KNOW I STRUGGLE WITH THAT. MYSELF BUT I MEAN I THINK WE BALANCE THAT. AGAINST THE SOCIETAL GOOD THAT WE THAT CAN BE. BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. SO I WAS ONLY ABLE WHAT DID YOU HAVE DISCUSSIONS. I'LL CUT MISCALCULATED. SO I AND YOU CAN COUNT ME AMONG THE EIGHTY SOME PERCENT OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT MONITORING AND TRACKING ME I KIND OF WONDER ABOUT THE TEN PLUS PERCENT WHO DO ON THAT- HOWEVER I'M NOT SURE I QUITE UNDERSTAND THE ACLU'S OPPOSITION WHICH AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THIS KIND OF A WHOLESALE- MORATORIUM ON THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF I MEAN THERE'S YOU KNOW WITH ANY TECHNOLOGY AND SHE CAN COME UP WITH AN ENDLESS LIST OF- POTENTIALLY MALICIOUS- USES AND GENERALLY WE TRY TO. REGULATE OR PROHIBIT THOSE PARTICULAR MALICIOUS USES- AS OPPOSED TO JUST- YOU KNOW BAND THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF SO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGIES KIND OF SIMILAR TO MR OBERNOLTE IS QUESTION AT THAT IS SO DISTINCTIVE SUCH THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WINDS GOVERNMENT YOU JUST AUTOMATICALLY FOLLOW WHAT WE- TAKE AN APPROACH THAT'S A LITTLE MORE FOCUSED AND WE'LL GET WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSES EXIST. SO I BELIEVE THAT LIKE MOST LEGISLATORS AND THAT WITHOUT IMMEDIATE ACTION. GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE USE A FACIAL RECOGNITION DOES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO KIND OF SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL WITH SOME OF THOSE- SITUATIONS THAT YOU FEEL LIKE. TO CROSS THE BORDER OF WANTING TO OF BEING TRACKED ALL THE TIME FOR EXAMPLE- AND SO IT'S PRUDENT TO TAKE A PAUSE. WITH THE MORATORIUM AND CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR FREEDOMS OUR SAFETY AND OUR DEMOCRACY AND FIGURE OUT. IF THERE ARE ANY SUCH USES THAT MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION BECAUSE- THERE ARE. REAL BENEFITS THAT I- AND EITHER NO REAL REST OR THE OUTWEIGH THE REAL BREASTS BUT RIGHT NOW TO TAKE A PAUSE. SO THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT BEING DEPLOYED IN THESE DANGEROUS AND HARMFUL WAYS SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MORE OR LESS AGREE WITH MY APPROACHED. TIMIDLY WE SHOULD BE. REGULATING ON THAT YOU KNOW CASE BY CASE OUR APPLICATION BASED YOU KNOW BASIS AS OPPOSED. BUT BUT YOU THINK THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS KIND OF GOT AND THE HEAD OF OUR UNDERSTANDING SO WE NEED TO. CREATE SPACE FOR THOSE DECISIONS TO BE MADE IS THAT THE- I'M I WOULD SAY THAT WE DO NEED TO CREATE THE SPACE FOR- THE- EXAMINATION TO CONTINUE. BUT I. NECESSARILY AT THAT AT THIS POINT I'M- SAYING THAT THERE ARE OFTEN USES THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED OR THAT COULD BE. THE HARMS TO A. B. C. MITIGATED OR ELIMINATED THREE REGULATIONS THAT THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THAT WE NEED TO PRESS PAUSE. AND LOOK AT THAT MORE THOROUGHLY WHILE NOT USING THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE MEANTIME. I IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT A LITTLE BIT- AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO. WHAT FOR WHAT YOU KNOW- FOR PURPOSES OF DISCUSSION JUST TO TODAY. ARE YOU'RE PROPOSING A KIND OF A MORATORIUM A COMPLETE BAN UNTIL YOU HIT YOU HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON. BUT AREN'T YOU ALSO- DISMISSING A LOT OF BENEFITS CREATED BY THE BY THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IN LIGHT OF. YOU KNOW THE- THINGS THAT IT'S BEING. YELP CREATED OR- THE FACT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS USING THE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT'S A FIGHTING CRIME AND ALL THAT SO ARE YOU DISMISSING ALL THAT YOU KNOW AT THE SAME TIME- I MEAN I. IT BY HITTING THE PAUSE BUTTON ARE YOU SEE SOME SIMPLY SUGGESTING THAT WE SHOULDN'T USE THAT AT ALL WHATSOEVER- YOU KNOW YOU TO BUY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OTHERWISE. SO YOU CAN'T BUILD A FACIAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM INTENDED FOR CRIME FIGHTING WITHOUT ALSO CREATING ONE THEY CANBE IS TO STIFLE PROTESTS- ATTACK IMMIGRANTS MONITOR PEOPLE JUST GOING ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES THAT THEY COME. HAND IN HAND- BECAUSE IT'S THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE SYSTEM ITSELF THAT ALLOWS IT TO BE USED IN EITHER WAY AND SO ONCE THE SYSTEMS ARE BUILT THE HARM IS DONE AND SUPPORT. SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING THE WORST CRIMES I WOULD SUGGEST THAT RATHER THAN ASKING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HANDLE EDITION BUT ISSUES THAT WOULD BE BETTER ADDRESSED BY PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. SUCH AS STOPPING THE CRIMINALIZATION OF DRUG ADDICTION CRIMINALIZATION OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND POVERTY. AND MOVING IN SAID TOWARDS A CULTURE OF CARE THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO MAKING SAFE COMMUNITY. WITHOUT INTRODUCING ALL OF VERY REAL HARMS THAT FEATURE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY PRESENTS. ARE WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FOURTH AMENDMENT COME INTO PLAY IN THIS CONTACTS A- D. THE VIEW THAT THE USE OF- F. R. T. CONSTITUTE A SEARCH UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. OUR IN IT IT THE TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITS STATE IMAGES TAKEN OPENS THIS IS LOW. FIVE EIGHT I SET YOU KNOW SETTING OR EVEN SO. FOR THE PERRIN FOR INSTANCE. I'M SAY THAT ADAM CURRY CASE I WOULD INTO THAT THERE ARE DO IN YOUR OF PRIVACY UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT DEPENDING ON WHERE THE PHOTO WAS TAKEN YES BUT I'M AS I'M WAS EARLIER SAID BEING OUT PUBLIC DOESN'T FULLY DIMINISH YOUR AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY SO FROM YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT I HAVE DONE ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS A FOURTH AMENDMENT- RIGHT AT PLAY THAT MIGHT HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR CONTEXT IN WHICH FACIAL RECOGNITION IS BEING USED IN A PARTICULAR CASE IF THAT MAKES SENSE AS FAR AS WHERE THE PROBE PHOTO WAS TAKEN FROM. I'M AND I WOULD JUST ALSO ADD THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION WOULD CALL INTO QUESTION A PERSON'S RIGHT NOT TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT- WE HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO SAY WHO WE ARE BUT IF LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN JUST SNAP A PHOTO OF US. RUN IT THROUGH A DATABASE AND COME UP WITH THAT ON OUR OWN THAT THAT WOULD IMPLICATE THAT RIGHT- AND THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT ALSO NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT. YEAH I SEE. THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS- CONTINUING SO TO SPEAK- I THINK- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY- ARE CURRENTLY. YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT REGULATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ALL ON THE OTHER EXTREME OF THE CONTINUUM IS A COMPLETE. BAN OR A MORATORIUM FOR EXAMPLE. IN ALONG THE CONTINUUM DO YOU SEE VIEW SOME KIND OF A YOU KNOW A SPOT WHERE. IT IS MORE REASONABLE- TO BE ADDED FOR THE STATE OF FOR EXAMPLE I'M JUST THROWING THINGS OUT. WHETHER OBTAINING CONSENT OR NOTICE AND OR NOTICE- TO THE PERSONS WHOSE IMAGES BEING. CAPTURE WOULD DOT ALSO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS. ALONG THAT CONTINUUM FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND ONE THAT I THINK WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO. PONDER AND DISCUSS WHILE WE HAVE A MORATORIUM IN PLACE TO PUT A PAUSE ON THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY UNTIL WE HAVE AN ANSWER- AS A CALIFORNIA ON AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP WHO WHO. WHO IS A DINO WHO IS CONDUCTING ON THE STATE EASE WHILE WE HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON. ON TO SOME EXTENT THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO ASK SOMEONE TO- I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT AT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED IN CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTY ORGANIZATIONS AS TO WHETHER THERE ARE ANY POTENTIAL POSITIVE USES OR WHETHER THE HARMS REALLY DO OUTWEIGH. ANY BENEFITS- AND AS OF RIGHT NOW- THERE ARE AND SIXTY PLUS ORGANIZATIONS FROM- YOU KNOW TRADITIONAL CIVIL LIBERTIES ORGANIZATIONS TO IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS RACIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS HERE SAID THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO EITHER HIT POTS WITH A MORATORIUM OR DO AN OUTRIGHT BAN THAT THAT IS WHERE THEY SEE IT THE- APPROPRIATE BALANCE. YOUR IMAGE IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK THE TWO LADIES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YEAH SO THAT BRINGS US TO THE NEXT PANEL. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME ALL FOURTH PANEL WHO IS SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND POTENTIAL NEED FOR. GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. ARE CATHERINE CRUMB. IS AN ASSISTANT CRITICAL PART OF CLINICAL AND SORRY CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF LAW AND DIRECTOR AT THE SAM HOUSTON LAW TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC POLICY CLINICS SHE'S ALSO CO DIRECTOR. AT THE BERKELEY CENTER FOR LAW AND TECHNOLOGY. ALSO JOINING US ON MICHAEL MCLAUGHLIN RESEARCH ANALYST AT THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION- ALSO JOINING US IS- MISTER ADAM SHORTS SO SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE- ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. AND FINALLY- WE HAVE MISTER RYAN HARKINS SO SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT MICROSOFT- WELCOME ALL OF YOU- PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD BEFORE YOU BEGIN SAYS. WELCOME CAN WE START WITH SAY THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THESE HEARINGS IT'S BEEN A FASCINATING RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES ON THIS ISSUE- SO I'M AN ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR AT BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL MY NAME IS KATHERINE COMP AND I DIRECT THE SAME AS IN CLINIC FOR LAW TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC POLICY. SO SURPRISING ABOUT A CALL. THIS ROOM ACTUALLY OF THE YEAR THERE SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE BANNED OUT RIGHT MAYBE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE POLICE UNION BELIEVE THAT SELF REGULATION IS THE ANSWER BUT I IMAGINE MOST OF US FALL SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS QUESTION- MOST OF US ALL OF US I WOULD SAY ONE AT THE CAPITOL BECAUSE THAT SHOOTER TO BE FOUND AND OFFICIAL RECOGNITION CAN DO THAT- ALL THE BETTER. AT THE SAME TIME I THINK YOU CAN CONCEDE THAT POINT WHILE ALSO BEING DEEPLY TROUBLED BY THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY- AND I'D LIKE TO SPEND MY TIME- TALKING PARTICULARLY ABOUT SOME OF THE CIVIL LIBERTIES CONSEQUENCES OF DEPLOYMENT OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES PRETTY IT IMPACT ON THE- BEING IN PUBLIC. AND THOUGH I WILL DO THAT IN REFERENCE TO THE FIRST AMEND RIGHT AT TWO ASSEMBLY AND THE FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO PRIVACY BUT OF COURSE YOU THE CONSTITUTION MAY. OR WHAT THE PROTECT OUR UP THAT SAID THE CEILING AND THIS BY HAS NO ROLE TO DETERMINING THE RULES OF THE ROAD FOR USING THIS TECHNOLOGY- SO. ONE OF REASONS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSED TO IS WHAT IS A- DE ABOUT THE USE OF FACIAL. TECHNOLOGY I THINK MEMBER OBERNOLTE WAS AT TALKING ABOUT THAT- AND- EIGHT IT IS JUST A VAST EXPANSION OF THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE OUT IN PUBLIC. IT IS A HUGE CHANGE IT IS TRUE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN VIDEO. SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN PUBLIC PLACES FOR A LONG TIME. BUT IN GENERAL NO ONE LOOKED AT THE FOOTAGE RIGHT YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE IF FOR EXAMPLE A CRIME OCCURRED- AND YOU'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY SOMEONE- BUT THERE WAS NO PERSISTENT PERPETUAL REVIEWING OF THE FOOTAGE. AND IN LOOKING AT THE FOOTAGE REQUIRED SOME EFFORT SOME PEOPLE ARE FOR THIS HOSPITAL REQUIRES TIME IT REQUIRES COMMITMENT A LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES. AND FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY COUPLED WITH ALGORITHM ALGORITHMS THAT CAN ANALYZE FOOTAGE RAISE THE PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE ON A FAIRLY PERSISTENT BASIS IN PUBLIC PLACES. AND FOR A PRACTICAL MATTER THAT IS A RADICAL CHANGE TO HOW WE ARE IN PUBLIC- IS THE ESSENTIAL EXAMPLE COMES FROM THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT. WE HAVE A PERSON MEANT. I JUST READ OF SPEED BUT ALSO TO SOME. IN THE- AND- IN COURT HAS ROAD. THAT AND THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THESE RIGHTS ANONYMOUSLY. THE QUINTESSENTIAL CASE IS THE NWC TV ALABAMA CASE IN WHICH- THE STATE OF ALABAMA ATTEMPTED TO REQUIRE THE AND DOUBLE ACP TO DISCLOSE ITS MEMBERSHIP. THIS CASE DATED FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT AMERICAN HISTORY UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU A DATE THE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF AS AN AND DOUBLE ACP. MEMBER IN ALABAMA NINETEEN FIFTY WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO JOIN AND THE SUPREME COURT SAID THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT ENCOMPASSES THE RIGHT. NOT JUST TO- EXERCISE YOUR FREEDOMS BUT TO DO SO FREE FROM HAVING TO DO SO PUBLICLY AND THAT'S EXTENDED TO PUBLIC PROTESTS AND IT IS SURE IT IS TRUE TO BE SURE. THAT WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN PUBLIC YOU MIGHT BE INCIDENTALLY IDENTIFIED RIGHT YOU COULD RUN INTO A FRIEND YOU COULD RUN INTO A NEIGHBOR YOU COULD DRAW THE ATTENTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SOME HOW BUT IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT- I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY- THE FIRST PRESENTER SLIDER HE SHOULD AN IMAGE OF A CROWD. WITH A LITTLE YELLOW BOX AROUND EVERY FACE RIGHT THAT AND WHEN ULTIMATELY BEING ABLE TO NOT JUST RECOGNIZE THOSE FACES WHICH IS WHAT THAT SLIDE WAS ABOUT BUT ULTIMATELY TO IDENTIFY THOSE PEOPLE. AT SCALE IT FUNDAMENTALLY. AND THE MOST STRIKING EXAMPLE OF ALL OF THIS WAS NOT A U. S. BASED EXAMPLE BUT A HONG KONG BASED EXAMPLE WHEN WE ARE WATCHING PROTESTERS IN MASKS- GOING OUT TO PROTEST. BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIRE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES BUT FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT IS LOST AT POTENTIALLY FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE IF PEOPLE- IT CAN'T GO OUT AND PROTEST WITHOUT THINKING THAT THEIR EVERY MOVEMENT IS. AT EVERY IMAGE IS GOING TO BE TRACKED- SO. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS WHERE TO THE FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO PRIVACY COME IN. IF THERE IS A TO BE FREE FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES. AND IT TO THE MATTER. WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT PLAY PATIENT. TECHNOLOGY ON THE HAND PEOPLE'S. SAID TO HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A SEAT IN THERE FOR. PARTICULARLY PUBLIC. A THE OTHER HAND IN A SERIES RECENT CASES THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THE QUESTION. OF TO WHAT EXTENT ARE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES DIFFERENT FROM ANALOG TECHNOLOGIES UP SO FOR EXAMPLE. IT IS OFTEN CNCLUDED- THAT THERE ARE MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES- IN A RECENT CASE FOR EXAMPLE- THE SUPREME COURT CONCLUDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDED A WARRANT BASED ON PROBABLE CAUSE. TO OBTAIN- I'LL- SELL SITE LOCATION AT IS IT PROBABLE CAUSE TO SEARCH THE CONTENT OF AN ARRESTED PERSON CELL PHONE. NOW THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LAWYERS KNOW THAT SEARCHING SOMEONE'S POCKETS RIGHT IT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD SIMPLY DO INCIDENT TO ARREST WITH NO WARRANT WHATSOEVER JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED. BUT THE SUPREME COURT DECLINES TO EXTEND THAT TO ALLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO SEARCH A CELL PHONE. AND IT DID SO BECAUSE IT THOUGHT. THAT SAYING THAT SEARCHING POCKETS COMPARED TO SEARCHING A CELL PHONE WAS LIKE SAYING A RIDE ON HORSEBACK IS IN DISTINGUISHES MATERIALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE. FROM A FLIGHT TO THE MOON RIGHT THERE'S REALLY NO DIFFERENCE AND THERE'S A VAST DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF PRIVACY INVASION. OF GOING THROUGH SOMEONE'S POCKETS AND GO THROUGH THE BILL DECK. OF AND- SOMEONE ELSE PREVIEW. SEC FOLLOWING SOMEONE THAT MAY NOT IMPLICATE A FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHT READY PHYSICALLY FOLLOW SOMEONE AND SOME ARGUED THAT WHY THEN CAN'T YOU SIMPLY OBTAIN SOMEONE'S HISTORICAL CELL PHONE LOCATION HERDS. AS WELL RIGHT THAT IS ALSO- TRACKING EOPLE WHERE THEY MOVE UP BUT THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID THAT THAT ACTUALLY DOES REQUIRE OF FOURTH AMENDMENT WARRANT- AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THE DIGITAL NATURE OF THE DATA- BECAUSE THE COURT SAID THAT THE TIME STAMP DATA PROVIDED INTIMATE WINDOW INTO A PERSON'S PERSONAL LIFE. REVEALING NOT ONLY HIS PARTICULAR MOVEMENTS BUT THROUGH THAN HIS FAMILIAL POLITICAL PROFESSIONAL RELIGIOUS AND SEXUAL ASSOCIATIONS RIGHT THERE WHEN YOU START TO BE ABLE TO TRACK PEOPLE SPACES THE MAN HE DATABASES ANALYZE I'M NOT YOU ARE SIMPLY YOU KNOW A MOONS LINK AWAY FROM OUR PREVIOUS ANALOG WORLD IN WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE- INDIVIDUALS- LOOKING AT ONE- ONE AT TANK DONE IF I. AN SO GUTEN BEFORE. OF THE CONSTITUTION PER A- OF REGULATION AND NOT A CEILING AND THE FACT THAT THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ISSUE PLAYS. AT PLAY DOES NOT MEAN THAT THIS BODY SIMPLY WAIT FOR COURTS TO RESOLVE THIS- THAT TENDS TO TAKE A LONG TIME IT TOOK THE COURT UNTIL- THE- TWENTY TEN FOR EXAMPLE TO DECIDE THAT A CELL PHONE- RESEARCH TRIGGERS THE FOURTH AMENDMENT WE DON'T WANNA RATE AROUND FOR SIMILAR PERIODS OF. TIME AND ALSO THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN SEPARATELY SIGNALING THAT IT WOULD VASTLY PREFER IT LEGISLATORS RATHER THAN- THE SUPREME COURT DECIDE THESE TECHNOLOGY ISSUES AS- JUSTICE LEADER REMARKED IN AN OPINION A LEGISLATIVE BODY IS WELL SUITED TO GAME. CHANGING PUBLIC ATTITUDES TO DROP DETAILED LINES AND TO BALANCE PRICE AND HOW SAFETY IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND THAT IS OF COURSE OR JOB HERE. THE ONE THING I THINK YOU SO I TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD. YOU AB WHICH FEELS I'M SURE INVITE ME JUST THAT SO HERE I AM THE ONE THING I. SHOULD NOT IS TO. IS UNIQUE IN THAT IN THE DAYS BE PERMITTED THIS REGULATE WE HAVE TREMENDOUS I'M OF RESEARCH. FOR BUT POLICE. WELL PLACE TO MAKE VALUES TRADE OFFS AND IT IS YOUR JOB TO DECIDE HOW TO VALUE PUBLIC SAFETY VERSUS PRIVACY VERSUS FREE SPEECH AND WHERE THOSE LINE SHOULD BE DRAWN- SO WHEN IT COMES TO- REGULATION A FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY I THINK REASONABLE MINDS CAN DIFFER ABOUT WHAT WE DO- AND- BY THE WAY. ALTHOUGH A MORATORIUM SOUNDS EXTREME IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACT IN MORATORIUM HAD TO ACTUALLY PUT IN DETAILED REGULATIONS A MORATORIUM ME SOUNDS LIKE A VERY GOOD IDEA. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE IS NO STAYING STILL THIS DEBATE. IF YOU DO NOTHING THIS TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLY GOING TO BECOME MORE ENTRENCHED AND THEN IT IS GOING TO BE EVER HARDER FOR YOU TO REGULATE. BECAUSE LAW ENFORCER THAT. LOT ON THIS TECH. IT THE ARE YOU CAN THEN CUT AND REGULATE IS WILL APPEAR EVEN. RESTIVE SO. YOU MAY BE WILL POSE NOW TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL CONNECTION DATE BUT IF YOU SIDE THAT FURTHER TIME IN EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY IS. A REQUIRED THAT AT LEAST ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT USES AND SO IT WOULD BE BETTER PUT MORE INTERNET PLACE OR MAINLY THE WINDOW AND HIGHLY. THERE IS A- AND IS POTENTIAL AND THAT IS WHEN IT TO THE PERVASIVE USE RECOGNITION TO IN PUBLIC PLACES IT MAY BE THE AMERICANS ARE PREPARE TO KNOW THAT EVERY TIME THEY STEP OUT OF DOORS- THEY COULD POTENTIALLY BE- MONITORED WITHOUT SUSPICION- TO LOOK AT PEOPLE'S FACES TO ENGAGE IN SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY CORRELATION THAT AND IF THINGS. AREN'T QUESTION REALLY A YOU KNOW AND THAT'S A WITH RELATIVELY EASY TO WRITE TO REGULATE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT HAPPENING. THAT'S RIGHT IT MAY BE THE FUTURE BUT IT IS NOT THE PRESENT AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T HAVE TO OPPOSE ANYONE'S ENTRENCHED PROGRAM. I THINK THE REAL QUESTION COMES- BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT NEVER USES WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT SUSPECTS A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHO'S BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEOTAPE- HAS BEEN- IT IS HAS BEEN SHOWN ENGAGING IN A CRIME AND THEY IDENTIFY THAT. AND THAT'S LEGITIMATE USE THIS TECHNOLOGY IN MY VIEW BUT IT SHOULD BE REGULATED- AND- SOME OF MY FELLOW LAW PROFESSORS FRIEDMAN AND ANDREW. HAVE MADE A PROPOSAL THIS IS I THINK IS REALLY QUITE REASONABLE FIRST OF ALL THEY THINK THIS TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE USED UNTIL ISSUES A BIASED CAN BE WORKED OUT THEY'RE NOT ISSUES A BIAS ALREADY COUSIN IN POLICING. WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THINGS WORK BUT THAT HARD. LAN FOR TO BE A- TO. THEY WANT TO USE THE SECOND IT'S NOT BANNED BUT YOU DO HAVE TO GO TO JUDGE SO YOU HAVE A PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE IS ENGAGED IN WRONGDOING AND THAT USING THIS PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY WILL HELP IDENTIFY SOMEONE HAS COMMITTED A CRIME. A THIRD. THERE SHOULD BE AS OTHERS HAVE SAID- OF. REQUIRED THAT IT THAT THE CRIME AT ISSUE BE A SERIOUS ONE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID WHEN IT FIRST IMPLEMENTED WIRE TAPS- IT PASSED TITLE THREE OF THE WIRE TAP LAW SAYING THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN. WIRE TAPS BUT BECAUSE IS THE PRIVACY INVASIVE TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN ONLY DO SO FOR THE NUMERATOR LIST OF CRIMES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY SERIOUS. ON AND FIND. OF IT AND I THINK HERE I IN THE POLICE UNION A THREE- THERE SHOULD BE REALLY EXTENSIVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OR FIREMEN SO THERE SHOULD BE PUBLIC POLICIES WHAT THEY USE THEY SHOULD OUTLINED THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED- AND IT SHOULD BE AUDIT REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHO HAS USED THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND IF BEST. IT RESULT IN A MATCH I. A VERY OFTEN POLICE TECHNOLOGIES PROPAGATE- AND- USED- BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WHICH IS THIS ACTUALLY HELPING TO SOLVE CRIME WE OFTEN HEAR LONG LIST OF VERY COMPELLING ANECDOTES ABOUT THAT HIS CELL PARTICULAR CRIMES. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER DO SOMETHING SYSTEMATICALLY WE SHOULD HAVE SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH CHAU. MISTER MCLAUGHLIN. MY NAME IS MICHAEL MCLAUGHLIN GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN CHAO WASTE YOUR KILEY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY. FISHER RECOGNITION IS IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO OUR SOCIETY FOR EXAMPLE AS A BELIEVE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THE TECHNOLOGY HAS HELPED IDENTIFY IN LEE TO THE RESCUE FROM CHAPTER TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. INCLUDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE BENEFITS ALSO INCLUDE INCREASED CONVENIENCE FOR CONSUMERS AND A TEST OF THE LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT FISHER RECOGNITION REDUCE THE TIME IT TAKES TO BOARD A PLANE BY HALF. NONETHELESS FISHER RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES ALSO MISS UNDERSTOOD. THIS MISUNDERSTANDING IS ONE REASON WHY SOME OUR SOCIETY AKON FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION BANDS. IMPLEMENTING A BANNING CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THE WRONG APPROACH. TODAY LIKE TO FOCUS ON THREE THINGS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED FROM POSSIBLE ABUSES OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND SEVERAL WAYS INCLUDING BY STATE LAW. THE US CONSTITUTION AND SELF REGULATORY EFFORTS BY INDUSTRY. SECOND I WILL OFFER NUMEROUS WAYS LAWMAKERS CAN FURTHER PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S FROM POTENTIAL ABUSES OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THIRD I WOULD DISCUSS WIDE BAND OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TEMPORARY PERMIT IS NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA. BUT BACK TO MY INITIAL POINT. THE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION IS CONSTRAINED IN SEVERAL WAYS WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY TARGET REGULATIONS RATHER THAN BANDS IS THE BEST PATH FORWARD. FOR EXAMPLE THE NEWLY ENACTED CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT PROVIDES CALIFORNIA'S NUMEROUS PRIVACY RIGHTS BETWEEN THE COLLECTION USE AND SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA. INCLUDING IMAGERY OF THE FACE. THE LAW REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO INFORM CONSUMERS OF THEIR COLLECTING PERSONAL DATA CONSUMERS ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE REASON WHY A BUSINESS IS COLLECTING DATA AND IF THE BUSINESS TO SOME OF THE DATA AND TO HIM. BUSINESS IS ALSO UP TO DELETE PERSONAL DATA THE CONSUMERS REQUESTS AND CONSUMERS CAN BLOCKING ORGANIZATION FROM SELLING THEIR DATA. COLLECTIVELY THESE RIGHTS INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION BY PRIVATE ACTORS. AND LIMIT POTENTIAL ABUSES SUCH AS THE UNWANTED SALE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION DATA. AND LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA ALSO PASSED AB TWELVE FIFTEEN ALSO KNOWN AS THE BODY CAMERA ACCOUNTABILITY% ACT THE ACT PROHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING FISHER RECOGNITION IN CONJUNCTION OF BODY CAMERAS. IN ADDITION THE US CONSTITUTION LIKELY PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT ABUSING THE TECHNOLOGY. A. D. THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO SEVILLE AN INDIVIDUAL FOR EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT A SEARCH WARRANT. IS LIKELY A VIOLATION OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. THE STATE OR PUBLIC BECAUSE TO MAKE AN ARREST ALSO PROTECTS CALIFORNIANS. FINALLY INDUSTRY HAS DEVELOPED VOLUNTARY SELF REGULATION AND PRINCIPLES TO FOSTER FOSTER THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. INDEED MANY OF THE LEADING FISHER RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY VENDORS INCLUDING GOOGLE MICROSOFT AND AMAZON. HAVE DEVELOPED PRINCIPLES OUR GUIDANCE FOR THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. MY SECOND POINT IS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT THE POTENTIAL ABUSES. ARE OR POTENTIAL MISUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REQUIRE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES PUBLICLY DISCLOSED THEY ARE USING THE TECHNOLOGY. THE STATE SHOULD ALSO CAR THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ONE OF THE ROLE OF AN AGENCY ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS. STANDARDS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN YOU SPECIAL RECOGNITION AND SENSE OF ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS AYE PROTESTS. AND POLICIES FOR HOW THE STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CAN ACQUIRE AND SHARE PHOTOS USED FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION. IN ADDITION THE STATE SHOULD REQUIRE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OBTAIN A WARRANT TO USE FACE RECOGNITION. OR ANY TECHNOLOGY TO TRACK THE LOCATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REQUIRE HAT STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES HAVE WRITTEN POLICIES AND HOW THEY WERE USED THE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS ENCOURAGE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO POUT PILOT THE TECHNOLOGY BEFORE IMPLEMENTING IT. POUTING THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT LEARN A PARTICULAR FISHER RECOGNITION SYSTEM STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. AND ABOUT HOW PERFORMS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. IF CALIFORNIANS WERE TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF THIS TOP TECHNOLOGY SHOULD KEEP A SET THE TABLE WHICH PILOTS CAN HELP IT DO. MY THIRD AND FINAL POINT. IS THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT REASONS WHY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ADOPT TARGETED LEGISLATION. FOR FISHER RECOGNITION RATHER THAN BAND THE TECHNOLOGY. FIRST MANY CRITICS CONTRABAND STATE MISLEADING RESEARCH TO BOLSTER THEIR CLAIMS. FOR EXAMPLE THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION HAS PRODUCED TWO MISLEADING REPORTS. THE ENACT WE SUGGEST FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ARE ACCURATE. AND THE FIRST REPORT THE A SO YOU USE AMAZON'S RECOGNITION SERVICE. TO COMPARE MUGSHOT IMAGES OF CRIMINALS TO PHOTOS. OF MEMBERS OF THE NIGHT'S IT'S CONGRESS. COVER THE ACER USE THAT ARTIFICIALLY LOW CONFIDENCE SPECIALS FOR MATCHING FACES. TO CREATE THESE RESULTS THAT MANY FALSE POSITIVES WERE ALLOWED WHICH I BELIEVE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. INDEED AMAZON HAS NOTED THAT THE A STILL USE ERROR RATES FOR MATCHING MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS WOULD HAVE DROPPED TO ZERO. IF I TO USE AN APPROPRIATE CONFISCATED SKEWS ME APPROPRIATE CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD OF 99% THE ACLU REPEATED ITS TEST IN THE SAME MANNER FOR CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS EVEN AFTER AMAZON HAVE PUBLICLY CLARIFIED ITS POSITION ON APPROPRIATE COMP AND SOCIALS. SECOND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY HAS FOUND THAT THE BEST FACIAL RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS ARE EXTREMELY ACCURATE. FOR EXAMPLE THE BEST OUR THEM THIS TESTED IN A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT FILTERING THE CORRECT CANDIDATE AS THE MOST LIKELY MATCH ONLY ZERO ONE POINT 2% OF THE TIME WHEN PERFORMING A SEARCH OF A DATABASE THAT CONTAINED. IMAGES OF THREE MILLION INDIVIDUALS. THIRD THE BEST FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS HAVE NO OR LITTLE BIAS. IN THIS REPORT. ACTOR ALBUMS HAVE UNDETECTABLE BIASES- UNDETECTABLE EXCUSE ME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE MOTIVATION FOR MANY OF THE BANDS IS A CONCERN ABOUT RACIAL BIAS BUT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE FOR THE BEST PERFORMING ALGORITHMS. FOURTH FANS CAN HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO'S BAN A GOVERNMENT AGENCIES USING FACIAL RECOGNITION MEDIA LEGAL FOR THE SEASON POINTS YOU CITY ISSUE OUR PHONES WHICH USE FACIAL RECOGNITION. FIFTH THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HEARD CLAIMS A TECHNOLOGY WILL LEAD TO WIDESPREAD SURVEILLANCE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES MANY PEOPLE FEEL TRANSISTOR FEARED TRANSISTORS WOULD SPELL THE END OF PIRACY AS MINIATURE ELECTRONICS COULD BE USED USED UP ON PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS. AND IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS PRIVACY ADVOCATES CALLED FOR BANDS OF RFID CHIPS WE USE RATED WHICH USE RADIO WAVES TO TRANSMIT. DATA AND THE FEARS THAT STORES GOVERNMENTS ARE TERRACE TRACKING INDIVIDUALS WITH RFID NEVER MATERIALIZED MOREOVER JUST AS TRANSISTORS TO NOT GIVE RISE TO WIDESPREAD EAVESDROPPING NOW THEY WILL FACE RECOGNITION WE TO PERVASIVE SO UP SURVEILLANCE. IN CONCLUSION. TARGET LEGISLATION COULD ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA RECEIVES BOTH THE BENEFITS OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. WITHOUT TO PLAYING RACIALLY BIASED TECHNOLOGY OR SUFFERING UNDER A CHINESE STYLE MASS SURVEILLANCE. BUT OFFICIAL RECOGNITION BAND A MORATORIUM LIMITS NOT ONLY THE NEGATIVE USES OFFICIAL RECOGNITION BUT ALSO THE POSITIVE USES A FACIAL RECOGNITION. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S GO TO MISTER SHORTS THE NEXT. AND A CHILD ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS A- OKAY. KILEY MY NAME IS ADAM SHORTS I AM A SENIOR LAWYER AT THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. EFF IS A NON PROFIT THAT WORKS TO ENSURE THE TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTS FREEDOM- JUSTICE AND INNOVATION FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. ON BEHALF OF OUR MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY INCLUDING THOUSANDS FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY THIS AFTERNOON AT THIS VERY pHEARD FROM A NUMBER OF PANELISTS FACE SURVEILLANCE IS PROFOUNDLY DANGEROUS. IT INVADES OUR PRIVACY BY TRACKING A UNIQUE MARKER WE SHOW EVERYWHERE WE GO AND CANNOT CHANGE OUR OWN FACES. THIS CAN TURN OUR MOVEMENTS IN ASSOCIATIONS AND OPEN BOOKS FOR SCRUTINY BY BUREAUCRATS AND BUSINESSES ALIKE TO SCRUTINIZE. THIS DETERS SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION IN PUBLIC PLACES. AGGRAVATES ADJUSTING EXISTING UNFAIR RACE DISPARITIES- THAT PLAGUE OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT CAN BE USED AGAINST IMMIGRANTS AND DISSIDENTS AND WHEN FACE PRINTS ARE STOLEN AS THEY OFTEN ARE IT OPENS UP TO RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT. AND SO EFS MESSAGE TODAY TO THE CALIFORNIA. STATE ASSEMBLY IS SIMPLE OUT WE REQUEST THAT YOU BàN THE GOVERNMENTS USE A FACE SURVEILLANCE AND THAT ADDS TO PRIVATE SECTOR USE IF A SURVEILLANCE THERE BE A REQUIREMENT OF INFORMED OPT IN CONSENT. BEFORE A BUSINESS YOU CAN COLLECT SOMEBODY'S FACE PRINT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT CITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY ARE BANNING GOVERNMENT USED TO FACE OF ALEX WE'VE HEARD ABOUT- HEARING CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO BERKELEY AND OAKLAND. A FOR SUCH CITIES HAVE DONE THIS IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. EFF IS WORKING WITH ADVOCACY GROUPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY- TO- ENCOURAGE MORE CITIES TO DO THIS AND A PROGRAM THAT WE CALL ABOUT FACE. AND SO WE URGE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE NOT TO INTERFERE WITH EFFORTS BY CITY LEADERS TO PROTECT THEIR CONSTITUENTS RATHER ANY STATE LEGISLATION ABOUT THE SURVEILLANCE OUGHT TO EXPRESS THE ALLOW CITIES TO CONTINUE THIS IMPORTANT WORK. AND ASH SHOULD NOT PREEMPTS CITIES FROM DOING SO. WE ALSO URGE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO ENACT BASELINE PROTECTIONS AND WE'RE OFF TO A VERY GOOD START WITH LAST YEAR'S ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE FIFTEEN SPONSORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANG. AS YOU'VE HEARD IT PLACES A THREE OF FACE SURVEILLANCE WHEN USED IN CONNECTION WITH CAMERAS WORN OR CARRIED BY POLICE OFFICERS AND PROVIDES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BY WAY OF ENFORCEMENT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE THAT. IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A LAW- A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS TRULY THE BEST WAY TO INSURE ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE ALL TOO OFTEN- AGENCIES CHARGED WITH ENFORCEMENT. DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO DO SO. THERE ARE FOUR CRITICAL WAYS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THIS AUGUST BODY TO BUILD UPON. THE WORK DONE LAST YEAR HE AND ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE FIFTEEN. AT FIRST WHERE THE STE WE NEED A STATE LAW THAT APPLIES TO ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND NOT JUST TO A POLICE DEPARTMENTS ALL THE GOVERNMENT'S USE OF FACE SURVEILLANCE IS HAZARDOUS TO PRIVACY FOR EXAMPLE STATE DMV IS AS WE'VE HEARD HAVE AYE AYES CONDUCT FACE RECOGNITION ON DRIVER PHOTOS. FOR IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES. SECOND WE NEED A STATE LAW THAT APPLIES TO ALL TYPES OF GOVERNMENT USE OF FACE SURVEILLANCE AND NOT JUST WHEN USED IN CONNECTION WITH CAMERAS THAT SOMEONE IS CARRYING OR WEARING SO FOR EXAMPLE MANY RESIDENTS OF SAN DIEGO OUR CONCERNS ABOUT IMAGES THAT WERE CAPTURED BY SMART STREET LIGHTS YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY PAUL CAMERAS. BEING USED IN CONNECTION WITH FACED A BALANCE. NUMBER THREE WE NEED A STATE LAW THAT APPLIES NOT JUST TO THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF USING ITS OWN FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM. BUT ALSO TO GOVERNMENT ACQUIRING INFORMATION DERIVED FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE CLEARVIEW A AYE THIS COMPANY THAT HAS GATHERED THREE BILLION PUBLIC FACING FACES- APPARENTLY ASSEMBLED A STORE HOUSE OF THREE BILLION FACE PRINCE. AND HAS GIVEN INFORMATION TO TWO THOUSAND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS WELL AS PRIVATE. ENTITIES AND HAS DONE SO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES IN JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ANY LEGISLATION HERE APPLIES NOT JUST WHEN THE GOVERNMENT USES ITS OWN. FACE RECOGNITION BUT WHEN IT ACQUIRES FACE RECOGNITION SERVICES FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. GONNA PAVE IT TO PRIVATE SECTORS USE OF FACE SURVEILLANCE. WE ASK THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO ENACT A LAW THAT REQUIRES A COMPANY. BEFORE DIRECTING FACE SURVEILLANCE AT A PARTICULAR PERSON TO GET THAT PERSON'S INFORMED OPT IN CONSENT. THAT WE SHOULD JUST THE CALIFORNIA CAN FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS WHICH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ENACTED ITS BIOMETRIC INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT OR FERPA. WHICH AGAIN REQUIRES. I'VE BEEN INTRODUCED TO GET CONSENT BEFORE CONDUCTING- FACE RECOGNITION OR OTHER BIOMETRIC HARVESTING UNDER THAT LAW. SOME CONSUMERS MIGHT BELIEVE IT'S IN THEIR INTEREST TO ALLOW THIS IS TO COLLECT THEIR FACE PRINT FOR EXAMPLE TO GET ON AN AIRPLANE OR TO ENTER A BUILDING OR TO UNLOCK THEIR PHONE. BUT WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE CONSUMER TO WEIGH THE PROS AND CONS FOR THEM. OF DOING SO- IT SHOULD BE THEIR OWN ECONOMIST CHOICE FREELY GIVEN. AND IT SHOULD NOT BE BUSINESSES THAT ASIDE FOR CONSUMERS- WEATHER APP THIS IS IN THE CONSUMERS INTERESTS. TO BE CLEAR IT IS A NOT ENOUGH WE BELIEVE. FOR STATE LAW TO REQUIRE BUSINESS SIMPLY TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS THAT FACE RECOGNITION IS GOING ON EITHER IN A PHYSICAL PLACE OR IN A DIGITAL PLACE. THAT GIVES THE POWER OF CHOICE TO THE BUSINESSES AND NOT TO THE CONSUMERS- EXCEPT IN THE NARROW SENSE THAT CONSUMER CAN REFUSE TO GO- ON THE INTERNET OR TO PUBLIC PLACES WHICH WE THINK IS REALLY. AT NO CHOICE AT ALL IN IN THIS DAY AND AGE I DO WANT TO. ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF RACE- IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AS A PROFESSOR CRUMPETS SAID WE HAVE FIRST AMENDMENT ENFORCEMENT ISSUES. IN PLAY HERE. EFF WAS SUGGESTED THERE ALSO ARE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT ISSUES- NUMBER ONE. THERE ARE- ARE EXISTING DISPARITIES IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BASED ON CENTURIES AND CENTURIES OF MISUSE SUCH THAT MUGSHOT DATABASES ARE MUGSHOT PHOTO DATABASES ARE- OVER CONCENTRATED WITH PEOPLE OF COLOR- YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THAT PEOPLE USE MARIJUANA AT THE SAME RATES AND GETS- ALL OF THE OR OR HIGHLY DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBERS OF MARIJUANA ARRESTS HAVE BEEN. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR COMPARED TO WHITE PEOPLE. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A BUSINESS USING FACE RECOGNITION TO IDENTIFY EVERYONE WALKING IN THE DOOR AND FIGURE OUT WHO THE POTENTIAL SHOPLIFTERS ARE WE ARE JUST AGGRAVATING USE EXISTING DISPARITIES. MCCALLA JUSTICE SYSTEM NUMBER TWO- OVER TIME NEW TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED DESPERATELY TO MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND APPLIED A DESPERATELY TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STOPPED BY POLICE WHICH OF COURSE- DESPERATELY ARE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. POLICE USING FRN PEOPLE THEY'RE STOPPING WERE TALKING DISPROPORTIONATELY ABOUT DOING THIS IN MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS TO MINORITY YOUNG MAN. NUMBER THREE WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE ERROR BIAS WHICH IS A SERIOUS ISSUE- I WOULD URGE THIS BODY TO LOOK AT THE WORK BEING DONE BY JOY. GLOBAL ON WE- WHO HAS MANY MANY STUDIES ABOUT THIS- THE NEWEST REPORT DOES SHOW THAT HAS SOME OF THE ERROR IS GOING DOWN WITH SOME OF THE SYSTEMS. IT ALSO SHOWS THAT A LOT OF ERROR IS CONTINUING WITH A LOT OF THE SYSTEMS AND WE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING ABOUT- GOVERNMENT USE OF FACE RECOGNITION OR BUSINESSES ARE USING IT WITHOUT CONSENT WELL THOSE- ISSUES LINGER. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT EXONERATION NO DOUBT- THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE BEHIND BARS WHO DON'T BELONG THERE AND WE SHOULD DO IT WE SHOULD SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS BY GOING TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM SUCH AS- HAVING BETTER FIGHTER. DEFENDERS OR CHANGING THE RULES OF EVIDENCE- REDUCING AMASSING CARS XIN AS THOSE TWO I'M DOING THIS KIND OF INDIRECT APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM- BY THROWING MORE TECHNOLOGY AT IT. I DO WANT TO FINALLY JUST NOTE THE PROBLEM OF MISSION CREEP YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD THE IDEA. THAT WE CAN BEGIN JUST BY IDENTIFYING A NOTE SUSPECT IN A PHOTOGRAPH BUT WE WON'T SEE YOU KNOW IT DANCE IT TOO- REAL TIME- OR YOU KNOW DRAGNET SURVEILLANCE AND COMMUNITY PLACES. BUT WE'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE UPCOMING OLYMPICS IN LOS ANGELES AS A REASON TO BE DOING FACE SURVEILLANCE AND- TO MY YEARS THAT SOUNDS LIKE DRAGNET REAL TIME FACE OF ALICE TO STOP A TERRORIST. YOU KNOW FROM WALKING INTO A CROWDED BUILDING WE'VE ALSO. HEARD ABOUT AND RESTRICTING ARE USED TO MUGSHOT DATABASES- ONLY TO HEAR THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT USE OF- IMAGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS ALREADY A CLEAR VIEW A I IS DOING AND THOUSANDS OF POLICE DEPARTMENT TO TAKING. ADVANTAGE OF. SO IN CONCLUSION FACE SURVEILLANCE IS ONE OF THE SINGLE GREATEST THREATS TO OUR DIGITAL PRIVACY WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT THIS. THIS BODY IS CONDUCTING THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE HEARING I AND AGAIN. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE A BAN ON GOVERNMENT USE AND REQUIREMENTS ON- PRIDE THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO GET- INFORMED OPT IN CONSENT BEFORE THE USE OF FACE SURVEILLANCE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. ALL ANSWER CHRIS. I APOLOGIZE. ARE MISTER HARKINS I BELIEVE. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS RYAN HARKINS I AM SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY WITH MICROSOFT AND ID LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. NO IS SITTING HERE LISTENING TO ALL OF THE PANELS. IT STRUCK ME THAT THIS IS YET THE LATEST ITERATION OF A STORY WE'VE SEEN PLAY OUT BEFORE. RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES A CHECK THAT BRING ALONG A WHOLE HOST OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS. BUT THAT ALSO CREATE A LOT OF DISRUPTION. IN THAT CREATE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR A LOT OF THE VALUES THAT HAVE GOVERNED IN OUR COUNTRY SINCE ITS FOUNDING. CHALLENGES THE PRIVACY CHALLENGES TO CIVIL LIBERTIES CHALLENGES TO DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS. THESE ARE CHALLENGES FRANKLY THAT WE'VE FACED FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. AND THEIR THEIR CHALLENGES THAT HAVE LED OUR COMPANY IN PARTICULAR OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN PLUS YEARS. DAD FOR REGULATION. THE STEP UP AN ADVOCATE AS WE'VE DONE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE FOR COMPREHENSIVE PRIVACY LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY. MORE RECENTLY TO CALL FOR REGULATION OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN CONTROVERSY. IT'S BECAUSE SOME OF OUR FRIENDS IN INDUSTRY TO CRITICIZE US FOR ASKING FOR NEW RULES THAT WOULD APPLY TO US AND ALL OF THEM. IT'S BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE IF YOU WILL TO CRITICIZE US FOR ADVOCATING FOR WHAT THEY VIEW AS- WEAK REGULATION THAT WOULD QUOTE LEGITIMIZE TECHNOLOGY. I THINK THAT PRESENTS A AN UNFORTUNATE MISUNDERSTANDING OF OUR COMPANY'S POSITION AND OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. AND MY HOPE IS THAT THIS HEARING CAN START MORE CONVERSATIONS AMONG ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS INDUSTRY CONSUMERS GOVERNMENT'S ADVOCATES. ABOUT WHAT THE RULES OUGHT TO BE IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO GET THE BENEFITS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FACE RECOGNITION. WELL ADDRESSING THE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY POSES. SO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS PROVIDING A WHOLE HOST OF BENEFITS ANY AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE EXAMPLES TODAY. SECURITY I'M A MORE EFFICIENT AND BETTER WAY TO ACCESS YOUR DEVICE OR YOUR ACCOUNTS- IT'S OFTENTIMES MORE SECURE THAN SIMPLY RELYING ON PASSWORDS IDENTIFYING MISSING CHILDREN IDENTIFYING. INCAPACITATED PEOPLE WHOARE IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE IDENTIFYING VICTIMS OF CRIMES. IDENTIFIED SUSPECTS AT LARGE. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER USES WE FOR EXAMPLE. HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED SCENE A I. WHICH IS BEING DEVELOPED BY A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AT MICROSOFT NAME SHEIK MOHAMMED IN THE U. K. WHO LOST AS I SAID AT THE AGE OF SEVEN. AND IT'S A PROGRAM WHICH WOULD CONNECT TWO GLASSES WITH A HIGH POWERED CAMERA. WITH THEN SYNC UP TO THE CLOUD. IN USING A AYE AND FACE A RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER THINGS PROVIDE HIM OR OTHER PEOPLE WITH VISION IMPAIRMENT THE NARRATIVE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM. BUT BUT WE AGREE WITH THE CONCERNS. THE CONCERNS ABOUT BIAS IN THEM AND DISCRIMINATION THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY STUDIES AND IT DOES NO ONE ANY GOOD TO SHY AWAY FROM THEM THAT SHOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IN MANY INSTANCES HAS BEEN MORE ACCURATE FOR YOUNG WHITE MALES THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR WOMEN THAT BEEN FOR OLDER PEOPLE. THOSE THINGS SHOULD CONCERN ALL OF US. THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES WITH THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF CAMERAS IN PUBLIC SPACES. AND THE RAPID IMPROVEMENT IN FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES IT POSES REAL CONCERNS ABOUT. SURVEILLANCE OF THE PUBLIC. BASS A RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CONDUCT MASS SURVEILLANCE OF THE PUBLIC. SO. THEIR CONCERNS AS WELL ABOUT DUE PROCESS THESE ARE CONCERNS FRANKLY THAT RELATE TO THE USE OF A AYE MORE GENERALLY PARTICULARLY A BLACK BOX ALGORITHMS OUR ALGORITHMS WHICH ARE VERY GOOD AT DERIVING CONCLUSIONS FROM BROAD SETS OF DATA IDENTIFYING PATTERNS FROM BROAD SETS OF DATA BUT WHICH AREN'T AS GOOD. AT TELLING US HOW THEY ARRIVE AT THOSE CONCLUSIONS. THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS CAMPOS REAL CHALLENGES IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DECISIONS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE CONSEQUENTIAL AFFECTS OR LEGAL AFFECTS ABOUT THEM CRIMINAL JUSTICE THE PROVISION OF CREDIT INSURANCE EDUCATION SECTOR. SO HOW CAN WE START TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. WELL MAKING SURE WE ENABLE THE BENEFITS THE TECHNOLOGY IS PROVIDING THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT COMPANIES CAN DO THEMSELVES. SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF CONCERNS. THAT LED MICROSOFT FOR EXAMPLE TO CREATE AN ETHICS COMMITTEE WITHIN THE COMPANY. THE ETHER COMMITTEE AND I ALWAYS BLANK ON WHAT YOU THROUGH MEANS THE A. I. IN ETHICS IN ENGINEERING AND RESEARCH COMMITTEE IT'S AN ETHICS COMMITTEE THAT CONSISTS OF SENIOR MEMBERS ARE SENIOR LEADERS AROUND THE COMPANY. WHICH PRODUCED AND PUBLISHED A SET OF ETHICAL PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN THE WAY WE DEVELOP AND DEPLOY THE TECHNOLOGY. THEY REVIEW HOW WE'RE DOING AND WHETHER WE'RE COMPLYING WITH OUR PRINCIPLES. DAVE USE THAT TO TURN DOWN BUSINESS. WE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE TURNED DOWN PROPOSALS TO DEPLOY FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ON POLICE BODY WORN CAMERAS BECAUSE WE THINK IT WOULD BE UNETHICAL TO DO SO. THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THERE IT'S INACCURATE AND THE RISKS OF GETTING SOMETHING WRONG IN THE SCENARIOS IN WHICH IT WOULD BE DEPLOYED ARE FAR TOO GREAT. IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT LED US TO DEVELOP A SIMILAR SET OF ETHICAL PRINCIPLES SPECIFICALLY FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. BUT SELF REGULATION IS NOT ENOUGH. NONE OF US SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH RELYING UPON CORPORATIONS TO REGULATE THEMSELVES AND MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS IN THIS SPACE THE TECHNOLOGIES TOO POWERFUL THE RISKS ARE TOO GREAT. AND FRANKLY NOT EVERY ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE THE WILL OR THE RESOURCES OF A PLACE LIKE MICROSOFT. TO IMPOSE RULES UPON ITSELF. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN RECENT EXAMPLES PERHAPS OF THAT IN THE PRESS AND FRANKLY. A RACE TO THE BOTTOM IN AN UNFETTERED MARKETPLACE BENEFITS NO ONE. IT'S WHY WE HAVE BEEN CALLING SINCE THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN SPECIFICALLY FOR GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN AND PASS LAWS. SO WHAT SHOULD THOSE LAWS LOOK LIKE. WE'VE SUPPORTED LEGISLATION IN OUR HOME STATE OF WASHINGTON. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE WOULD APPLAUD YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN INTRODUCING AB TWO TWO SIX ONE WE'VE SUPPORTED LEGISLATION IN OTHER PLACES THAT WOULD REGULATE BOTH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN THEIR USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- OF FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. FOR EXAMPLE. WE'VE SUPPORTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE IT FOR EXAMPLE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS OF BY SYMPTOMS AND DISCRIMINATION BY REQUIRING THEM TO TEST THE TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY FOR BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION. BY REQUIRING THEM TO ENABLE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES TO TEST THE TECHNOLOGY FOR BY CENTER AND DISCRIMINATION WHETHER IT'S THROUGH. THE EIGHTEEN AN API AN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM TO ALLOW THIRD PARTIES TO TEST THE TECHNOLOGY NOT ALL COMPANIES DO THAT. BY REQUIRING THEM. TO HAVE TO PUT IN PLACE A PLAN TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS ANY INACCURACIES IN ERRORS AND BIASES PARTICULARLY ERRORS IN BY A SEIZE ACROSS A POPULATIONS- TO ACTUALLY PUT IN PLACE PLANS TO START TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT COMPANIES WHO HAVE EXPOSED THEIR TECHNOLOGY TO INDEPENDENT TESTING. TO THE SORT OF PUBLIC SHAMING THAT FRANKLY WE WERE PART OF WITH THE RECENT MIT GENDER SHOULD STUDY. A STUDY THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN TESTED THE GENDER CLASSIFIER FOR VARIOUS- FACE RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS AND COMPARED THE ERROR RATES ACROSS VARIOUS SUBGROUPS. FIRST SET OF RESULTS WAS REVEALED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND- FOR OUR OUT PROGRAMS FRANKLY THEY WERE EMBARRASSING. THE ERROR RATE FOR WHITE MEN WAS 0% AS YOU MIGHT GUESS. THE ERROR RATE FOR BLACK MEN WAS 6% THE ERROR RATE FOR WHITE WOMEN WAS ONE POINT 7% TO AIR IT FOR BLACK WOMEN WAS TWENTY POINT 8% ACCEPTABLE. IT EMBARRASSED OUR ENGINEERING TEAM SO THEY GOT TO WORK IMPROVING THE ALGORITHMS AND SPECIFICALLY IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND THE PROPORTIONALITY OF THE DATA SETS THEY WERE USING TO TRAIN THEIR ALGORITHMS WE CAME BACK A YEAR LATER. THE ERROR RATES WERE AGAIN 0% FOR WHITE MEN POINT 3% FOR BLACK MEN. POINT 3% FOR WHITE WOMEN. IN ONE POINT 5% FOR BLACK WOMEN NOT WHERE WE WOULD LIKE THEM. BUT WE'VE SEEN DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH RESPECT TO OTHER TESTING AS WELL. WE'VE SUPPORTED. RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE. SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER SHORTS IS SUGGESTING CONSENT IN ORDER TO ENROLL AN IMAGE OPT IN CONSENT IN ORDER TO ENROLL AN IMAGE OR A TEMPLATE CREATED BY. YOUR IMAGE AND A FACIAL RECOGNITION DATABASE WE'VE SUPPORTED OTHER RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY THAT WOULD REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE A PERSON TO BE IN THE LOOP. MEAN FOR HUMAN REVIEW OF SOMEONE WHO IS IN POWER TO CHANGE A DECISION THAT MIGHT BE MADE ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL- FOR SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS ABOUT PEOPLE IF FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THOSE DECISIONS. NAMELY DECISIONS THAT WOULD HAVE CONSEQUENTIAL ILLEGAL AFFECTS ON PEOPLE. AND FRANKLY WE ALSO HAVE SUPPORTED AND DO SUPPORT RESTRICTIONS ON THE GOVERNMENT'S USE OF TECHNOLOGY. RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE GREATER OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. REQUIRING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO PRODUCE PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY REPORTS BEFORE THEY PLAN TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY DESCRIBING HOW THEY WILL USE IT WHY ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON A CIVIL LIBERTIES AND MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. REQUIRING ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE GOVERNMENT'S ONGOING USE THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRING REPORTS FROM JUDGES. ABOUT ANY WARRANTS THEY ISSUE AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRING DISCLOSURES TO CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. IF PROSECUTORS ARE% GOING TO USE EVIDENCE GLEANED FROM THE TECHNOLOGY IN TRIAL. WE SUPPORTED OTHER SORTS OF RULES GREATER COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION. MANDATORY PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT PERIODS BEFORE THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED BY AGENCIES RULES THAT WOULD ADDRESS CONCERNS AROUND BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION. REQUIREMENTS FOR ON GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO TEST IT. IT FINALLY AMONG OTHER THINGS RESTRICTIONS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY. WE AGREE THAT THERE ARE VERY LEGITIMATE PUBLIC SAFETY USES OF THE TECHNOLOGY. AND WE WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT WHERE APPROPRIATE WITH RESTRICTIONS IN ORDER TO DO THEIR JOBS AND KEEP US SAFE. BUT THE TECHNOLOGY IS. POTENTIALLY PRONE TO ABUSE. AND WE'VE SEEN AS AT OTHER TIMES IN OUR HISTORY THE EXAMPLE OF WIRE TAPS IS A GOOD ONE. POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN GIVE THE GOVERNMENT A WINDOW INTO PEOPLE'S. ACTIVITIES THAT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE. SO WE WOULD SUPPORT AND HAVE SUPPORTED RULES THAT FOR EXAMPLE WOULD REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET A WARRANT BACK BY PROBABLE CAUSE BEFORE USING FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO SURVEIL PEOPLE IN PUBLIC PLACES. REQUIREMENT THAT SEARCH WARRANTS ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR SERIOUS CRIMES. REQUIREMENT THAT SEARCH WARRANTS ONLY BE AVAILABLE UPON THE APPROVAL OF SENIOR OFFICERS WITHIN A DEPARTMENT OR CARMEN PERHAPS EVEN OF NECESSITY. IN OTHER WORDS IT A SHOWING. THAT LAUNCH LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TRIED OTHER METHODS TO COLLECT THE EVIDENCE OR THAT THOSE SORTS OF METHODS- WOULD BE UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS ARE ON RECENTLY LIKELY TO SUCCEED THERE ARE PRECEDENTS FOR THESE KINDS OF RESTRICTIONS IN OUR LAWS. THIS IS THE KIND OF ARCHITECTURE THAT THE FEDERAL WIRETAP ACT HAS LONG APPLIED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN WIRETAPS IN ORDER TO CONDUCT SURVEILLANCE OF SUSPECTS. THE OTHER THING THAT OCCURRED TO ME AS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF. WIRE TAPS. YOU KNOW OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. WE SAW A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT. PROVIDED ALL SORTS OF BENEFITS BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY GAVE THE GOVERNMENT A WINDOW INTO PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS THAT PEOPLE USED TO BE ABLE TO HAPPEN THAT WAS THE TELEGRAPH AND THE TELEPHONE. AND WE SAW A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND UNEASE ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S POTENTIAL. USE OF WIRETAPS. SUPREME COURT IN THE ARM SAID CASE IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN INITIALLY RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT NEED A WARRANT IN ORDER TO CONDUCT WIRETAPS UNLESS IT PHYSICALLY TRUST PASSED ON SOMEONE'S HOME. THAT BECAUSE THE MEDIA OUTCRY INFECTED CAUSED CONGRESS A FEW YEARS LATER TO PASS WHAT REALLY WAS THE COUNTRY'S FIRST WIRE TAPS STATUE NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR A STATUE THOUGH THAT DIDN'T REALLY FIX THE PROBLEMS OF THE OLMSTEAD DECISION. IT TOOK THE COURT FORTY YEARS. NOT UNTIL THE CATS AND BURGER DECISIONS IN THE SIXTIES TO FINALLY OVERTURN HOMESTEAD AND HOLD. THE AMERICANS HAD- A FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO PRIVACY A RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM UNREASONABLE EXPECT OUR FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES IN THEIR PHONE CALLS IN THAT GOVERNMENT COULD VIOLATE THAT. WITHOUT PHYSICALLY TRESPASSING IN A HOME OR IN AN OFFICE. IN OUR VIEW SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE HAVE SUPPORTED IN IN LEGISLATION ARE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE DECISION THAT PROFESSOR CROP WAS ALLUDING TO THE CARBON THAT CARPENTER DECISION IN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT HELD. THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS OF SEARCH WARRANT BACK BY PROBABLE CAUSE IN ORDER TO TRACK SOMEONE'S LOCATION THROUGH THE PUBLIC USING CELL SITE LOCATION INFORMATION. WE THINK THE SAME SORT OF PRINCIPLES AT MINIMUM I TO APPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT'S SIMILAR USE OF FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES SO. WITH THAT I'D THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONIES AND WITHOUT THAT LIKE TO OPEN A FOR MISTER KILEY. YOUR QUESTION. I YEAH I JUST A COUPLE CONCLUDING REMARKS ON I THINK THE CHAIR AND THAT COMMITTEE FOR WHEN I WAS IN THIS AND THIS IS A VERY HELPFUL DISCUSSION- I- YOU KNOW A COUPLE TAKE AWAYS FROM ME ARE AT. I THINK THAT. ANY TALK RIGHT NOW OF THE CATEGORICAL BANNER MORATORIUM- WOULD- WIPE OUT TREMENDOUS. A SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC VALUE AND SO I WOULD NOT FAVOR THAT IN FACT I THINK THAT IF THERE ARE MUNICIPALITIES THAT ARE IMPOSING SUCH BANDS ABOUT. A RATIONAL BASIS THERE MIGHT BE A NEED FOR SOME LEVEL OF. OF UNIFORMITY BUT- AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH. TO SAY THAT IF YOU CAN MAKE AN ANALOGY. TO AN EXISTING- HUMAN PROCESS OR IF ALL WE'RE DOING IS. ENHANCING THE CAPABILITY OF A- OF A- HUMAN PROCESS THAT THERE AREN'T DISTINCTIVE PRIVACY CONCERNS I DO THINK THAT- AT A CERTAIN POINT A DIFFERENCE OF DEGREE BECOMES. A DIFFERENCE OF. KIND FOR- SOME OF THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN STATED. BY HAVING TO DO WITH SCALE OR MAKING SOMETHING- SYSTEMATIC AND I THINK EVEN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF. AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY- YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE PUBLIC SURVEILLANCE ISSUE- YOU DO HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT SOMEONE MIGHT. SEE YOUR FACE EVEN PERHAPS SOMEONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN YOU STEP OUTSIDE YOUR HOME- BUT PERHAPS YOU DON'T HAVE. A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT IT'LL BE- YOU KNOW- CAPTURED AND ANALYZED AND IDENTIFIED. AND STORES SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR- TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN A WAY THAT- THAT YOU KNOW MAXIMIZES THE UPSIDE WILL MINIMIZING- THE- THE LEGITIMATE RISKS AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF BETTER FOR. DISCUSSION I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR PARTICIPATING AT IT I MEAN. A COUPLE COMMENTS I HAVE WHAT WILL BE FIRST SAY THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL IN FURIOUS AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE TACKLED. LEGISLATIVELY AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON WHY THAT IS- I THINK THE COURTS ARE SENDING US A SIGNAL THAT. THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE A FIRM JUDICIAL BASIS FOR TACKLING THIS SOME IN THE FOURTH AMENDMENT THE CONSTITUTION IS NOT ABOUT PRIVACY IT'S ABOUT. UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURES AND SO YOU KNOW THE COURTS HAVE BEEN PUSHED FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER KIND OF OUT ON A LIMB THERE IN REALLY THEY'VE GONE AS FAR AS THEY CAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. THAT YOU KNOW IS APPROPRIATELY GOVERNED BY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF NOT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SO I MEAN I THINK WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING HERE AND HAVING. THIS DISCUSSION- OVER TO WILL ALSO WANT TO TALK JUST TO TOUCH ABOUT SOMETHING WAS SAID ABOUT THE NATURE OF THAT AT A BECAUSE- I MEAN I THINK THAT. THAT'S REALLY THE CRUX OF. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE ARGUE ABOUT PRIVACY WHEN I TALK ABOUT DIGITAL VERSUS ANALOG. THE REASON WHY. THE COURTS HAVE RULED THAT YOU NEED A SEARCH WARRANT TO SEARCH SOMEONE'S PHONE IS BECAUSE THERE'S INFORMATION IN THERE THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NOT DISCLOSED IT. I MEAN I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU AND KNOW WHAT YOUR SEARCH HISTORY IS ON YOUR IPHONE AND FRANKLY I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW BUT- YEAH AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY IT IT IT REQUIRES A WARRANT IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IT'S DIGITAL OR ITS ANALOG AND I THINK THAT THAT'S- KIND OF. AN INTERESTING THING ABOUT FACIAL RECOGNITION IS THAT WHEN YOU STEP OUTSIDE REALLY. YOUR FACE IS THERE. I MEAN IF YOU'RE HONG KONG YOU'RE GOING TO PROTEST AND YOU PUT A MASK ON. YOU'RE MAKING THE DECISION THE DECLARATION. YOU KNOW I'M NOT SHARING THAT INFORMATION OF. WHAT MY IDENTITY IS. AND IF YOU WALK OUTSIDE WITHOUT A MASK IT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT. THAT YES SOMEONE MIGHT LOOK AT ME AND RECOGNIZE ME AND I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT'S- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A FUN. THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE. I ALSO ONE OF VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE WITH SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A SET A COUPLE OF TIMES. I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THIS PANEL. WHICH IS THAT. THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIME SHOULD BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DISTINGUISHES WHETHER NOT FACIAL RECOGNITION. TECHNOLOGY IS APPROPRIATE. I VERY MUCH DISAGREE WITH THAT. I MEAN IF YOU ASK THE AVERAGE. CONSTITUENT OF OURS. WHETHER OR NOT. THEY THINK. THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR THEIR THEIR DOOR CAM. FOOTAGE WHEN SOMEONE STEALS AN AMAZON PACKAGE OFF OF THEIR PORCH. AND GIVE THAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THEY CAN IDENTIFY WHO DID IT. AND PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING FROM SOMEONE TO SOMEONE ELSE. YOU KNOW. 99% OF PEOPLE WILL SAY YES. OKAY THAT'S THAT'S REALLY ON THE LEAST SERIOUS. AXIS OF THE WHOLE CRIME SPECTRUM RIGHT. SO I MEAN I REALLY I REALLY THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOCIETAL BENEFITS THAT. COME FROM THIS THAT. DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH SERIOUSNESS OF CRIME. BOB AND I ALSO WISH. AND THIS IS PROBABLY IF YOU'LL HOLD BUT I MEAN I WISH WE COULD DIVORCE. THIS KIND OF PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION OF THIS ISSUE FROM. SOME OF THE VERY EMOTIONAL TOPICS THAT WE WRESTLE WITH AS A SOCIETY. AND BIASES A GREAT EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW WHEN WE SAY BYPASS. I MEAN I THINK THAT CONFLATES. AN EMOTIONAL BY US ON THE SENSE IN THE SENSE OF A PERSON. YOU KNOW WITH. A IRAQ AN INACCURACY FOR AN ALGORITHM RIGHT OR IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE ALGORITHM IS BIASED. WE CAN SAY THAT THE ALGORITHM HAS A DIFFERENT- SUCCESS RATE. FOR PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES THAT BE CORRECT NOT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE. AND WE NEED TO WORK ON. BUT IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT OVER. OUR WHAT WE HAD IN THE PAST WHICH IS KIND OF UNACKNOWLEDGED. HUMAN BY US. RIGHT SO IT'S ACTUALLY BY BY HAVING AN ALGORITHM DO IT AS LONG AS WE'RE CAREFUL ABOUT IT WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I SAW IT I THINK GOINGON HERE. IT'S BEEN SAID A COUPLE TIMES IN THIS ROOM TODAY THAT. FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY THREATENS THE SAFETY OF IMMIGRANT. COMMUNITIES RIGHT BUT WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW HERE. IS NOT. THE ALGORITHM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A DISAGREEMENT OVER FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW AND WHAT SHOULD BE ENFORCEABLE WHAT SHOULDN'T BE THAT'S- THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPIC. THE SOLVING OF FINALLY JUDGE THINK. ARE AGREE WITH MR KILEY ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT. OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY HAS A LOT OF BENEFICIAL USES YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I MEAN FIRST OF FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO POINT ON THIS ISSUE IN PASSING A MORATORIUM WOULD BE PROJECT. RIGHT WERE SAY ONE TO THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DISALLOW ALL THE BENEFICIAL USES AS WELL AS THAT IS THE NON BENEFICIAL USES I THINK INSTEAD WE NEED TO DO A VERY CAREFUL AND STUDIED ANALYSIS OF. HOW THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD BE ABUSED AND I MEAN IF YOU GO OUT ON THE LONG AXIS OF ABUSE RIGHT HOW COULD IT BE ABUSED WELL IF THE GOVERNMENT NEW. EVERY TIME-SOMEONE WENT INTO A PUBLIC PLACE EXACTLY WHO THEY WERE AND WHERE THEY WENT IF THAT RECORD WAS AVAILABLE ON A CONTINUAL BASIS YOU KNOW THROUGH ALL OF THE YEARS OF SOMEONE'S LIFE THE GOVERNMENT COULD USE THAT TO IDENTIFY DISSIDENTS- TO STIFLE FREE SPEECH IN WAYS THAT HAVE DONE BEEN DONE ELSEWHERE IN HUMAN HISTORY BY AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES. THAT'S TERRIFYING RIGHT THAT IS WHAT TRYING TO AVOID HERE. OKAY BUT TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO BAN FACIAL REST RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID OF THAT OUTCOME IS LIKE SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE AFRAID THAT PEOPLE OCCASIONALLY WE'LL GET INTO FATAL CAR ACCIDENT AND SO WE'RE GOING TO PREVENT ANYONE FOR PRIVATE CAR RIDES IT EXHIBIT BRUTICUS EXAMPLE BUT ESSENTIALLY PHILOSOPHICALLY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. INSTEAD I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON HOW THE USES OF THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN GO WRONG. AND PREVENT. THE GOVERNMENT USE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY IN WAYS. THAT THAT THAT LEAD TOWARDS THOSE OUTCOMES. RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING HERE AND IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF TIME IT'S GOING TO TAKE ENGAGEMENT BY. ALL OF US ARE ALL OUR VARIOUS USER COMMUNITIES- AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE- Y'ALL A LOT OF HEARINGS. AND A LOT OF DELIBERATION BUT THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO GO. SO ARE YOU KNOW TO THAT AND MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONVENE HEARING- THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF DIALOGUE THAT WE NEED TO BE HAVE. HAVING ON THIS TOPIC AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- INDENTURES OF TIME I I'M GONNA. JUST THERE PROBABLY CONCLUDE. BY THANKING ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE INCLUDING ALL THE OTHER PANELISTS WHO PRESENTED THE EARLIER- IN LET ME JUST ASK MY- COLLEAGUES I MEAN. THIS IS THIS HAS BEEN A VERY FASCINATING TOPIC. OF ALL OF THIS AND ALL I THANK YOU FOR EDUCATING OTHER MEMBERSHIP HERE- BECAUSE THIS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW WE- WE WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY AND YOU GUYS ARE IN THE TRENCHES YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT. SO IT'S BEEN. EXTREMELY HELPFUL TO US TO UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY IN AND WHERE WE SHOULD GO GOING FORWARD THE FROM THIS POINT. SO I WANTED ENGAGE- TOM BOB MANY OF YOU AFTER THIS HEARING IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. N. O. YOU DO PRESENT A YA YOU HAVE PRESENT A LOT OF. OUR GREAT INPUT THAT WE WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON.

FOR LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT. I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF- INACCURACIES WERE BETRAYED BY THE BY THE PANELISTS- THE HERE HOWEVER. A LOT OF REALLY GOOD POINTS THAT WERE RAISED. THAT COULD ABSOLUTELY BE SERVED BY REGULATION. REGULATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU- WITH HOW FRAZIER RECOGNITION WORKS- THAT IT DOES OPEN THE DOOR FOR CERTAIN ABUSES. AND WE WANT TO PREVENT THAT I WILL TELL YOU IN MY COUNTY SPECIFICALLY. IS THERE ARE THERE IS A MECHANISM TO PREVENT THOSE ABUSES IN ITS ONLY USED BY THOSE IT'S A MINUTE TO. A REGIONAL. INTELLIGENCE DIVISION INTELLIGENCE DIVISION TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT- IT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE. RENTERS FACE RECOGNITION. THE IT'S ONLY PERFORMED BY ACTUAL EXPERTS THAT KNOW THE LIMITATIONS AND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE TECHNOLOGY. IT BEFORE A RETURN IS PROVIDED. AND THE CONFIDENCE LEVEL IS NOT ONLY BY KAMALA COME FROM MY COMPUTER BUT IS CONFIRMED BY A PERSON. BEFORE THAT DETECTIVE OR THE DEPUTY IS PROVIDED WITH THE RESULT. I WILL TELL YOU IT HAS SOLVED NUMEROUS. CRIMES OVER OVER THE- OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. SINCE THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY ALONE- IN TWO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE IS POINT. A YOU DON'T WANNA LIMITED JUST TO SERIOUS OFFENSES BECAUSE THAT THAT DOESN'T SERVE THE COMMUNITY SO BEFORE I GOT INTO.

FOR RETAILERS IN THAT IS THAT. IS A HUGE HUGE. TOOL FOR THE IN IT'S REASONABLE FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO GO OUT AND PROTEST TO SAY. I EXPECT MY PRIVACY AND THAT'S REASONABLE- IT BUT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO ACTIVELY COMMITTING A CRIME IN TRYING TO VICTIMIZE THE PUBLIC. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME EXPECTATION THAT THE POLICE OR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE ANY RESOURCE THEY CAN'T TO TRY TO. BRING JUSTICE TO THE VICTIMS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THAT. I HAVE TALKING POINTS FOR ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY WERE MISREPRESENTED BUT IN THE REFERENCE OF TIME I WILL BRING IN.

NEXT UP PLEASE. I THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON FEELING READS THE VANCE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. I JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT- FACE USE OF FACIAL RUSSIAN RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. APPLICATIONS IN HEALTH CARE SPECIFICALLY IS JUST IN ITS BEGINNING PHASES WERE JUST STARTING TO. FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROMISE OF IT COULD BE- JUST A FEW EXAMPLES THINGS LIKE PATIENT SAFETY FROM- FALL OF AB MISIDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS- PREVENTING OPIOID DIVERSION- EMOTIONAL- RECOGNITION AND THINGS LIKE THAT RECOGNIZING PAYING MORE ACCURATELY THAN. HUMAN BEING MIGHT BE ABLE TO- JUST A FEW EXAMPLES SO WE JUST WANNA REMIND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS LEGISLATURE THAT ARE IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS. IN HEALTH CARE IN THE FUTURE. AND THAT'S IT AVAIL GIVE HIM THE QUESTION IF YOU TAKE VERY MUCH. THANKS PLEASE. A LITTLE SHORTER ALL RIGHT ERIC SABATINI ON THE CALEDON MANAGER FOR LACK CHRIS LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO- I ALSO HAD A FOUR MINUTE SPIEL AND I'M GONNA CUT IT DOWN JUST AS LIKE A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS- ONE THING I THINK THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE. CLARIFIED IS THE USE FOR SURVEILLANCE AND THE USE AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS FISH RECOGNITION IS NOT SURVEILLANCE IT'S A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED IN SURVEILLANCE. BUT IT IS NOT SURVEILLANCE IN ITSELF I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS IS KIND OF MUDDY THE WATER A LITTLE BIT. THE OTHER THING IS FACE RECOGNITION IS NOT SOMETHING NEW. IT'S NOT SOMETHING NEW IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT'S BEEN PART OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SENSE IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO ORGANICALLY TILL THE WANTED POSTER. RIGHT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE A- THE SUSPECT HAS TO BE IDENTIFIED IN COURT. IT IS PROBABLE CAUSE THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION THAT IDENTIFIES AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT A MACHINE OR DEVICE THAT SPITS OUT A PICTURE. AND SAYS THIS IS YOUR GUY GO ARREST THEM. SO I THINK THAT ALSO HAS BEEN KIND OF ELUDED TO IN IN THIS REPRESENTED HERE. I WANT TO OFFER LACK CHRIS IN OUR ASSISTANCE IN HELPING YOU GUYS CREATE AND WORKING WITH EVERYBODY WE'VE BEEN LIKE I SAID WE'VE BEEN IN TALKS WITH THE ACLU SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE WERE NOT WILLING TO DO THAT- AND IF ANYBODY WANTS NO JUST GO TO OUR WEBSITE LACKS DOT ORG AND YOU CAN SEE OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE ON THE WEB PAGE GOING. THROUGH YOUR QUESTION SO- DO WE USE RING DOOR ABOUT SO CRIMINAL EVIDENCE THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED TO IS THERE'S- EVIDENCE. REGARDING CRIMINAL OFFENDER RECORDS. AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT THAT. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS USED FOR LONG FOR FACE RECOGNITION INVESTIGATIONS THERE ARE RULES THAT GOVERN IT THE DOJ AUDIT TO. SO THERE IS EXISTING LAWS IN PLACE FOR CRIMINAL OFFENDER RECORD INFORMATION SO THERE THERE I GOVERNMENT'S ON ON TH&lt;c.cyan&gt; FACE RECOGNITION IS USED&lt;/c&gt; TO THAT- THE OTHER THING IS EVIDENCE SO. YOU KNOW DO USE RING DOORBELL INFORMATION YES WE DO USE SO SAYS A PRIVATE PERSON LEGALLY IF WE'LL ILLEGALLY OBTAINED EVIDENCE BE AT. A SOMEONE'S. SURE THE GUY WHEN THEY CALL PORTS PIRATE STEALING SOMETHING OFF THE PORCH RIGHT THAT'S ILLEGALLY OBTAINED PIECE OF EVIDENCE WITHIN RUN AGAINST THE CRIMINAL OFFENDER RECORD DATABASE. AND THEN IF WE GET LEADS ARE GENERATED THERE'S NO IDENTIFICATION AND THAT INVESTIGATION PASSED IDENTIFY THAT INDIVIDUAL. SO THERE'S ALREADY PROCESS IN PLACE AND IT'S ALREADY BEING USED LIKE THAT. BUT IT'S ALSO SAID THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IMPLICITLY BY A STORE TO BUY A STRAIGHT AND I ACTUALLY WANNA MAKE THE ARGUMENT AND THE EXPERTS CAN CAN WEIGH IN ON THAT. IT'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE. HUMANS HAVE BIASES WE'VE HAD INSTANCES WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL- RUNS A PERSON MALE HISPANIC AND ACTUALLY ENDS UP THROUGH. BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAINED AND GOING THROUGH PAST PRACTICES OF GOING I NEED A LITTLE LIMIT THIS AND NARROW IT DOWN. PERSON LOOKS LIKE- MALE HISPANIC I'M GONNA SEARCH MALE HISPANICS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WAS DONE IN THE PAST. WHEN YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH MANUAL BOOKS OF BOOKING PHOTOS. AGAIN THIS IS NOT NEW PROCESSES THIS IS EXISTING PROCESSES WELL WE'VE USED USED IN THE PAST WEEK- MANUALLY THROUGH THROUGH BOOKING PHOTOS. NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT AUTOMATES THAT. THAT PROCESS WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO INVESTIGATE. CRIMES OF LESSER SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE THE- THE ABILITY TO DO SO WHERE WOULD TAKE NUMEROUS MAN HOURS YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A BUNCH OF STUFF AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT SOME MORE AND PROBABLY IN A BETTER PLACE BUT- I. JUST WANT TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW AND IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS SIMILARLY IF FEEL FREE TO SUBMIT ANY TESTIMONIES YOU MAY HAVE A TO US IN WRITING AS WELL. SO WITHOUT DOUBT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE- FOR THOSE- WHO TRAVEL- LONG DISTANCE I THINK YOU PARTICULARLY- AND I'M TRULY GRATEFUL SELL US WITHOUT THAT YOU KNOW I WE DO WANT TO CONTINUE A DIALOGUE WITH YOU IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. AND WITHOUT THAT THE MEETING IS ADJOURNED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
