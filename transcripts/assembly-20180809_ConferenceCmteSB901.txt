WHILE ALL THE TOPICS IT IN THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THAT WE'RE STUDYING HAVE OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS WE KNOW THAT. NONE CARRY MORE EMOTION THAN THE TOPIC OFREFORMING UTILITY LIABILITY LAWS. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO THOROUGHLY AIR ALL POINTS OF VIEW. TO UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL CONCEPTS INVOLVED. IN THE RAMIFICATIONS A CHANGING ANY LEGAL STANDARDS OF LIABILITY. I WANT TO REITERATE WHAT I SAID ABOUT MY GOALS AND STANDARDS FOR MEASURING ANY POLICY WE CONSIDER FIRST. TO PREVENT FUTURE WILD FIRES FROM CLAIMING NEW VICTIMS. AND FIGHT FOR THE VICTIMS. OF LAST YEAR'S WILDFIRES. SECOND TO PREVENT RATEPAYERS AND TAXPAYERS. FROM BEARING UNDUE COSTS. I DON'T BELIEVE THE MEMBERS OF THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE INTEND TO PROVIDE A SAFE HARBOR FROM LIABILITY FOR UTILITIES. THAT ACT IRRESPONSIBLY. I ALSO BELIEVE. THAT ANY ACTION WE TAKE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIABILITY. SHOULD NOT DIS INCENTIVIZE UTILITIES. FOR MAKING MAXIMUM EFFORT INVESTMENT TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THEIR ELECTRICAL GRID INFRASTRUCTURE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THERE SHOULD BE NO SAFE CORNER FOR LAXITY ON PART OF THE UTILITY AND NOTHING. ON THE TABLE THAT WOULD CHANGE LIABILITY. FOR LAST YEAR'S WILDFIRES. AT THE SAME TIME. I BELIEVE IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THIS COMMITTEE. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW. THE SO CALLED NEW NORMAL. DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE MAY CREATE EXTREME CONDITIONS. AND HOW THOSE CONDITIONS MAY DISRUPT ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT EVEN WITH APPROPRIATE GREG HARDENING. I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT TO THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. HELPS AVOID FIRES AND HOLDS BAD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE. WHILE PROTECTING THE LONG TERM INTEREST. OF RATEPAYERS. BEFORE I TURN OVER MY CO CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF THE LAST FEW -- COUPLE HEARINGS. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT SPEAKERS FIVE MINUTES. I WHERE EACH EACH SPEAKER ON EACH PANEL HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO DISCUSS THAT. THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT THEM WELL AND THOSE PANELS ARE DONE WE WILL -- HAVE I WILL HAVE THAT I WILL HAVE THE MEMBERS -- ASK ANY QUESTIONS THEY MAY. I HAVE. ALSO GET READY ON PUBLIC COMMENT IT IS OUR INTENTION THIS IS WHY WE'RE HAVING SO MANY WE'VE HEARD SO IT'S OFFERED NO WE'VE GOT. THIS IS JUST TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. AYE WE CAN'T POSSIBLY DO THIS IN THREE AND A HALF FOUR WEEKS I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WITH SIX OR SEVEN COMMITTEE HEARINGS. THIS WILL BE THE MOST DISCUSSED DEBATED BILL. OF ANY OF THE PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE UNDER BILLS THAT WERE INTRODUCED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. SO MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT AT THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I TALK TO EVERY SINGLE MEMBER IS INTERESTED IN TRANSPARENCY. TO MAKE SURE THAT TO EVERYBODY GETS HURT. AND SO IN THAT VEIN ON EVERYBODY BEING HEARD A PUBLIC COMMENT WE'VE SEEN A TREND WHERE THIS -- I WOULD RESPECT EVERYBODY'S TIME MY FELLOW MEMBERS COLLEAGUES BUT ALSO EVERYBODY THAT'S HERE. IDEA IN THIS HEARING ROOM SO IF YOU HEARD. EVERYDAY YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE. A PUBLIC SPEAKING WHEN WE COME TO THE END OF IT. IF YOU'VE HEARD THE SAME THING THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PLEASE ASSOCIATE YOUR COMMENTS. WITH THE PERSON. DODD WHO SAID THEM BEFORE YOU AND LET'S MOVE ON WE WE UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE JUST BY THAT COMMENT ALONE. IT I THINK ALSO THAT -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMENTS AND PUBLIC COMMENT. ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE TOPIC WANTED IT TOPICS ON TODAY'S AGENDA. BEFORE TURN OVER A HAVE A QUESTION HERE CENTER JUST TO AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SUBMITTING A LETTER TO THE PUBLIC IF YOU CONNECT YOU SENATOR WE WILL TAKE ALL WRITTEN COMMENTS. THEY CAN BE PAGES AND PAGES OF PAGES ALL OF THE WRITTEN COMMENTS -- WE ARE WE WILL ACCEPT. I SO WITH THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLD. CO CHAIR. I THINK YOU I WILL JUST ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE TOUCH HERE'S BECAUSE OF ITS. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AMPLE TIME TO TO HEAR THE PRESENTATIONS AND DOWN JUST TO UNDERSCORE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH A NEW DYNAMIC AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS SORT OF CREATING A NEW BATH. BACKDROP FOR US TO EVALUATE OF THESE INCREDIBLE A CATASTROPHIC EVENTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY AND AND THE CAN THE QUEUE IN A FROM THE THINGS FROM THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD SO NOW WILL HAVE THE PRESENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AYE JAMES M. RALPH G. FOR POLICY LEGAL AFFAIRS OFFICE THE CPUC PRESIDENT MICHAEL PICKER. I SEE YOU I DREW THE SHORT STRAW. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. THANK YOU IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE SERIOUSLY. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE CHAIRS DOT IN HOLDEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M JAMES RALPH CHIEF A POLICY IN LEGAL AFFAIRS FOR CPUC PRESIDENT MICHAEL PICKER. THIS CAN THE COMMISSION HAS A BUSINESS MEAN SEPSIS GO THIS MORNING SO PRESENT PICKERS UNABLE TO ATTEND TODAY'S HEARING. BUT IS AN HONOR TO APPEAR TODAY AND DISCUSS TODAY'S TOPIC. PLEASE LET ME MAKE MY OBLIGATORY DISCLAIMERS I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS OF THE CPU SEE. I CAN'T DISCUSS ANY OPEN PROCEEDINGS OF THE CQC. HOWEVER I WILL FIRST PROVIDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DOCTOR AN INVERSE CONDEMNATION. SECOND DESCRIPTION THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THIRD I'LL CLOSE MY REMARKS BY DISCUSSING THE SENSIBLE BALANCE STRUCK BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I BELIEVE MICHAEL WORE A PROVIDED A GOOD SUMMARY OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION AT LAST WEEK'S HEARING. I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT HIS COMMENTS. BUT BRIEFLY PROVIDE CONTEXT INVERSE CONDEMNATION. IS A JUDICIAL DOCTRINE WHICH SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS HELD IS ROOTED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS OF ARTICLE ONE SECTION. NINETEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONSTITUTION. UNDER THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION DOCTRINE COURTS HOLD THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY VICE ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT ACTOR. ACTED REASONABLY OR FALL LAW. THIS IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO STRICT LIABILITY. PRINT SOME CASES THE CALIFORNIA COURTS OF APPEAL APPLY THE DOCTRINE OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION TO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. SO POWER LINES IN COMPLIANCE BUT TREE LIMB FALLS ON IT. AND CAUSES A FIRE THE UTILITIES STILL RESPONSIBLE. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS DELIBERATELY CHOSEN NOT USE INVERSE CONDEMNATION. NGUYEN FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S BECAUSE IMPROPER DAMAGE INSTEAD THE COURT HAS ESTABLISHED A SPECIAL REASONABLENESS TEST TO DETERMINE LIABILITY IN THOSE INSTANCES. IN THOSE CASES THE REALLY THE REASON ONUS OF FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S ACTIONS. A OUR IS DETERMINED. BY THE COURT WAYNE A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. THE PUBLIC GAINS FROM THE FLOOD FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICTS INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIVATE DAMAGES THAT RESULTED FROM THEIR ACTIONS. THIS IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A BELL AIR LAUGHLIN TEST. THE COMMUNITIES NEAR FLOOD CONTROL. INFRASTRUCTURE BENEFIT FROM INFRASTRUCTURE. WATER SUPPLY IRRIGATION AND FLOOD CONTROL TO NAME A FEW BENEFITS. HOWEVER THE PROVISION OF THESE SERVICES IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS. SO THE COURT DECIDED IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO WEIGH THE BENEFITS AND THE RISK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. SIMILAR TO FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S CALIFORNIA REALIZE ELECTRICITY TO POWER ITS ECONOMY AND COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE WHAT YOU SEE IS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE CALIFORNIA REQUIRES ITS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO SERVE LITERACY TO ALL PEOPLE UNTIL THE SERVICE TERRITORY. THE MODERN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS ALSO DEPENDENT. ON THIS NETWORK. THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION WHAT TRICITY IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS. THE SEVERITY THE DANGER. IT'S ONLY HIGH IN BY CLIMATE CHANGE WITH STORMS INCREASING FREQUENCY BECKONED TOPPLE POLLS AND SNAPPED POWERLINES. THIS TREND CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. BECAUSE BY WHAT YOUR TRANSMISSION OR COMPOUND CONSEQUENCES. ONCE AN EVENT HAS OCCURRED. HOLDING UTILITIES RECOUP RESPONSIBLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ACTED NEGLIGENTLY. OR FALL LAWS. IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS. THE APPLICATION STRICT LIABILITY. LEADS TO LOWER CREDIT RATING FOR UTILITIES. WHICH IN TURN LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS OF ARMENIAN HIGHER RATES FOR CALIFORNIANS. IT IS LSO MADE IT CHALLENGING FOR UTILITIES OBTAIN INSURANCE. IF UTILITIES CANNOT INSURE ORDER IF INSURANCE IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE ELITES HIGHER COST RATEPAYERS. LASTLY BUT MAKING U. CHILLY A FINANCIAL BACKSTOPS FOR ALL DAMAGES EVEN TO UTILITY NOT. VIOLATE A RULE WE RUN THE RISK OF UTILITY BECOMING FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THESE PROBLEMS. THE PROPOSAL HOLD UTILITIES BOTH INVESTOR AND PUBLICLY OWNED. ACCOUNTABLE IF UTILITIES OUT NEVER NEGLIGENTLY OR VIOLATE THE LAW [inaudible] HOWEVER. IF UTILITIES FALL THE LAW ENACT WITHIN REASON. THE PROPOSAL PROVIDES JUDGES A FRAMEWORK TO USE WHEN DETERMINING LIABILITY. FOR WILDFIRES SIMILAR TO FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. THE PROPOSAL AS A JUDGE WAY FIVE FACTORS. FIRST THE UTILITIES CONDUCT SECOND THE NATURE OF THE HARM TO PRIVATE PROPERTY. THIRD WHETHER UTILITY COMPLIED WITH THE LAW ON PC REGULATIONS. SORTS THE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THE HARM. AND WHETHER SAFER ALTERNATIVE WAS AVAILABLE. AND FIFTH OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE FIRE. MICHAEL WERE TESTIFIED LAST WEEK'S DOES CONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT ITS FRAMEWORK. I AGREE WITH HIS ASSESSMENT. BOLTON WITHOUT THE QUESTION WHICH WILL LIKELY BE DECIDED BY A COURT. IS IMPORTANCE CAN'T TO CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN APPLICATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION THE COURTS AND COST RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS AT THE COMMISSION. AND I KNOW THAT I'M AT MY FIVE MINUTE MARK WHILE I'M JUST WRAPPING THIS UP LET LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR EACH SIDE THIS THIS HEARING TODAY IS ON THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND YOU'VE GOT. THE TIME YOU NEED TO TO GET THROUGH YOUR PRESENTATION TAKE BANK BAKER CENTER. IS IMPORTANCE CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN APPLICATION INVERSE CONDEMNATION IN THE COURTS AND THE COST RECOVERY PROCEEDING. AT THE COMMISSION. IF UTILITY CREWS ALIVE BELIEVE THE COURTS BILL FIRST INVOKE ANY APPLICABLE INSURANCE POLICIES TO COVER THAT LIABILITY. THE CHILLY THEN MAY FILE FOR COST RECOVERY AT THE COMMISSION FOR ANY REMAINING LIABILITIES. AND COST RECOVERY PROCEEDING THE CPC ABOUT WHICH THE CONDUCTIVITY LD UNDER REASONABLE STANDARD OR THE PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARDS I'M SURE YOU ALL HAVE READ ABOUT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT PROCESS THAT HAS MANY BENEFITS. FIRST IT REDUCES THE SIZE OF A LIABILITY WHICH OCCURS IN COURT AND EVENTUALLY GOES IN THE RATES. BY NT HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY FALL THE LAW. SECOND INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY BE MORE INCLINED TO ENSURE UTILITIES IF UTILITY IS NOT STRICTLY LIABLE. NGUYEN. WHICH REDUCES FUTURE LIABILITIES. AND LASTLY IT SHOULD ALSO LEADER IMPROVE CREDIT SCORES TO UTILITIES AND LOWER THE COST OF BORROWING. WHICH IN THE END RESULTS IN LOWER RATES. IN CLOSING THERE ARE NO EASY SOLUTIONS HERE. HOWEVER IN A SIMILAR SITUATION THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. A FIRM REALLY DECIDED TO PLAY A REASON THIS TEST. AS AN EXCEPTION TO INVERSE CONDEMNATION. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FALLS ELITE OF COURT. AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR UTILITIES. WHEN THEY ARE NEGLIGENT AND DOES NOT CREATE A SAFE HARBOR? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS AFTERNOON I'M AVAILABLE FOR YOUR QUESTIONS [inaudible] QUESTIONS [inaudible] I'M. THUNDERSTONE THANK YOU -- MISTER. PRESIDENT. A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- IN A YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPARING FLOOD DAMAGE TO TO FIRE DAMAGE -- ISN'T IT TRUE THAT -- WHEN WERE? BILL HAVING HEAVY RAINS AND AND WE HAVE CONVEYANCES SO OUR RIVERS AND RESERVOIRS SET. OF THE FLOODING DAMAGE CAN BE READILY PREDICT -- WE HAVE A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE HEAVY SNOWPACK WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COME INTO A RESERVE FORCE HOW MUCH OF A NEWBORN OR RIVERS WERE. WILDFIRES IS COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO START HOW THEY'RE GONNA START. AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THIS IS THAT KIND OF GET THE LIABILITY ISSUES OCCUR THERE NOT THE SAME TYPE THE LIABILITIES. A WITH REGARD TO YOU KNOW -- UTILITIES AND WATER WATER COME CONVEYORS. BUT CENTER STONE I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION -- I AGREE THAT'S IMPORTANT OR CLOSELY AT WHETHER OR NOT -- FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S AND THIS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE DAY THAT THEY HAVE IS SIMILAR TO UTILITIES -- ULTIMATELY -- I'M I CAN'T TESTIFY AS TO HOW THE FREQUENCY FLOODS AND THE NATURE OF FLOODS IT'S BEYOND MY KNOWLEDGE. I I DO KNOW THOUGH THAT COMMUNITIES BENEFIT FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S AND IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES TO FLOURISH. AND THE COMMUNITIES RELY ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S THE SAME CASE WITH YOU TILT ELECTRIC UTILITIES. AND THE BENEFITS THAT THE COMMUNITIES CAME FROM THOSE UTILITIES -- IS SIMILAR. AND NO IT DOESN'T DIRECTLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I CAN'T SPEAK. TO TO THAT THE COMPARISON BETWEEN FLATTENED AND WILDFIRES APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR TEMPLE AND LASTLY. YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING CALLED THE BEL AIR LA CLEAR TEST IS THAT IS THAT A SUBTLE LAW IS THAT -- A DESCRIPTION OF A LEGAL PROCEEDING WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT NOWHERE IS A FOUND. BUT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SIR. ON THE BELLAIRE CASE IS THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE WHICH HELD THAT FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICTS WILL BE -- HELL TO DO DIFFERENT TYPE OF I HAVE -- THE CASE SITE FOR THAT AND I CAN TRY THAT YOUR STAFF IF YOU'D LIKE. BUT THEN -- LAUGHLIN IS THE CASE THAT FOLLOWED THAT CASE AND FURTHER DEVELOPED THE JURISPRUDENCE ON THIS ISSUE AND SO THERE'S A SERIES OF CASES -- PERTAINING TO FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICTS THAT DEVELOPED THE FACTORS THAT THE COURT SUPPLY AND THAT'S COMMONLY. IT COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE BEL AIRE LAUGHLIN TEST OKAY SO LOSES REFERS TO FLOOD CONTROL ISSUES SO YOU ADMIT YOU'RE MAKING THE NEXUS BETWEEN. THE BELLER LACHLAN TEST TOO OF LIABILITY FOR FOR WILDFIRES YEAH AND I I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS MODELED AFTER THAT TEST. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LOOKED AT THE CASE LAW THAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DEVELOPED. AND MODELED -- THE PROPOSAL THEM TO PUT EXCUSE ME THAN THE PROPOSAL'S MODELED AFTER THE FACTORS DEVELOPED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. AND THE IT A CLOSELY RESEMBLE. THE THE THE FACTORS OF COURSE TAKING ACCOUNT THAT UTILITIES AS YOU MENTION ARE DIFFERENT. IN SOME RESPECTS THAN FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S CERTS NOT VERBATIM. RESHAPE. IF YOU CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU. SO WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THAT WE SHOULD BE APPLYING THE FLOOD CONTROL RULES SIMILARLY TO THE ELECTRICAL GRID. RATHER THAN HAVE THE STRICT LIABILITY PROVISIONS THAT EXIST TODAY SAID CORRECT. YES I BELIEVE THAT -- SUMMARIZES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THOUGH THE THE FLOOD A A CAN THE FLOOD CONTROL CONT BECAUSE IT OF ALL FROM UPPER RIPARIAN LAND ISSUE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WITH THE UTILITIES IS NOT CORRECT. WELL -- UPPER RIPARIAN WATER ISSUES I AGREE DIFFERENT THAN WILDFIRES BUT I THINK THEY'RE SIMILAR IN WHICH CLIMATE CHANGE HAS LEAD -- TO INCREASE FLOODING IN SOME AREAS AND INCREASE WILDFIRE FIRES IN OTHER AREAS. BUT THE BASIS OF THE LAW THE REASON FOR THE LAW COMES FROM VERY VERY DIFFERENT PLACE. BUT THAT'S CORRECT IT IT'S AN OLDER -- BODY OF LAW THAT FOCUS ON ALL THE OLDER FLOOD SHORTAGE AND ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE COURTS HAVE FLAT OUT REJECTED THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD BECAUSE THE PRINCIPLES THAT A FLY APPLYING THE FLOOD CONTEXT. DON'T APPLY IN THE ELECTRICAL CONTEXT -- I AM NOT SURE WHICH CASE YOU'RE REFERRING TO I DON'T KNOW IF I AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT OF THEM NOT SO PERHAPS OUR NEXT PANEL COULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. BECAUSE REALLY WHAT I SEE YOU DOING HERE WITH THIS PROPOSAL SEEMS TO SORT OF CONFLATE. TO MAKING THEM THE SAME BUT IN FACT THEY REALLY AREN'T THE SAME AND SO I HAVE LITTLE DIFFICULTY APPLYING THIS JUST BECAUSE WE USE IT -- IN FLOOD CONTROL ASPECTS THAT BECAUSE WE USE AT THERE WE SHOULD USE IT WITH THE ELECTRICAL. BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING ARE YOU NOT. WELL LET ME IF I MAY UM -- RESPOND BRIEFLY TO THAT AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT I'M GLAD YOU RAISED IT -- THIS IS SENATOR -- THE COURTS AND DEVELOPING A FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT CASES HAD EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PUBLIC POLICY BENEFITS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDED AND I NAME A COUPLE THEN -- HERE -- WE HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION -- WHERE THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS INHERENT RISK THE SAME WAY THAT FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICTS HAVE INHERENT RISK LEVEES FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S INHERENT RISK WITH THE LEVY -- NEAR A COMMUNITY. AND THE CORD UNIFIED PUBLIC POLICY REASONS FOR WHY IT'S A PROBLEM TO HOLD -- THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH FLIGHT CONTROL DISTRICTS STRICTLY LIABLE BECAUSE IT WILL PREVENT DICKS UNITS FROM BENEFITING FROM ALL THE BENEFITS. AND I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY THAT'S THE SAME AS A WAITRESS DE -- INFRASTRUCTURE BY INSANE AND IT IS SIMILAR. SOMEONE TO CLEAR I'M NOT TRYING TO CONFLATE I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT THEY'RE SIMILAR AND I THINK THE CASE IS PACKED BILL VERSUS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. DIDN'T WELL I I GUESS ON TROUBLED BY. THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO COMPARE THE TWO IS APPLES TO APPLES WHEN THEY'RE REALLY NOT. SO IF THERE'S A JUSTIFICATION WHY WE SHOULD BE APPLYING THOSE STANDARDS IT SEEMS TO ME IT SHOULD BE. BASED ON THE UNIQUENESS OF ARE UTILITY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TRYING TO SAY WELL IF WE DO IT FOR FLOOD CONTROL WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT. HERE NIGHT I'D LIKE TO HAVE A BET IF I IF YOU WILL A BETTER REASON WHY -- THAT THE TWO ARE CONNECTED OR SHOULD BE CONNECTED NOT THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED NOW THE COURTS TO MAKE CLEAR THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED NOW -- SO -- A I'M TROUBLED BY THAT ANALOGY BUT I WOULD LIKE -- REQUIREMENTS THE FIVE CONDITIONS AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT THEY OPERATE IN A REASONABLY PRUDENT MANNER. I THINK BASED UPON THE THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD SO FAR IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS -- THE INMATES ARE ESSENTIALLY% RUNNING THE ASYLUM THAT THERE BEEN NO STANDARDS SET BY ANYBODY AS TO WHAT IS REASONABLENESS. ALSO BEFORE WE DECIDE SOMEONE'S ACTING REASONABLE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT REACH REASONABLENESS WOULD BE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IS OF CONCERN TO ME WHY WERE TALKING ABOUT RICK. LIMITING LIABILITY WHEN WE HAVE NEWMAN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE UTILITY COMPANY SHOULD BE DOING TO EVEN BE ABLE TO COME. TO A BEFORE THE COURTS OR SOMEONE AND SAY STILL DEFINITION P. YOU SEE SAID THAT THEY'RE WAY BEHIND THE BAR A EIGHT BALL ON THIS AND UTILITIES TO FIND. SAFETY IN RECENT BONUS ACCORDING TO THE WAY THEY DEFINE IT. SO HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. BOSE SAID SENATOR I THINK THAT YOU'VE RAISED AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AND AT SOME SHOW TOO AND YOU KNOW. I APOLOGIZE IF I IF I SAID THE FIVE SAID THAT REPEATEDLY -- YET I WON ADDRESS BRIEFLY -- AN ISSUE WHICH I THINK IS COMMONLY DISCUSSED BUT HASN'T REALLY BEEN ADDRESSED FULLY HERE. WHICH IS A NET THERE'S THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARDS OF THE SPEAR COURT AND THE JUDGE IS GONNA APPLY THAT STANDARD AND THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT STANDARD IN ANYWAY -- YEAH ONE OF THE FACTORS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS UTILITIES CONDUCT WHICH IS I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING -- REGARDLESS OF HOW THE LIABILITIES ACCRUED AT THE COURTS. EVENTUALLY. NEWS UTILITY MAY SEE COST RECOVERY AT THE COMMISSION. AND THEIR WE'VE FLY RESOURCE CENTER. WHICH IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A PERIMETER STANDARD. AND THOSE ARE OFTEN CONFLATED BUT DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT STANDARDS APPLIED BY DIFFERENT BODIES [inaudible] AND I HAVE NOT SHORT ANSWER QUESTION BY ONE JUST PRIDE THAT CLARITY -- TO COMMITTEE. WELL THAT IS PART OF THE QUESTION IS SENATORS. TO WHOSE STANDARD WE GONNA USE RIGHT NOW THERE AREN'T ANY STANDARDS WE HAVE -- SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC THEY'VE THEY'VE DETERMINE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE APPEAR -- PEACHY ANY STANDARDS AND I'M TOLD THERE'S NO ONE HERE TODAY FROM PEACHY NEEDS TO SPEAK WHICH IS KIND DISAPPOINTING. BUT THEIR STANDARDS A HERE AND EDISON STANDARDS APPARENTLY ARE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE WHO STOOD I MEAN. E. THAT'S PART OF WHY WE HAVE EARLY CARE ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WELL WE SHOULD CARE WE SHOULD DETERMINE THIS ON THE BASIS OF NEGLIGENCE. BUT WHO'S TO DECIDE AT THIS POINT WITHOUT ANY STANDARDS WHAT IS AND ISN'T NEGLIGENT CONDUCT. WELL I USE ON TUESDAY WE RECEIVE TESTIMONY REGARDING ANOTHER SECTION GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH IS THE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS -- I IT'S BEYOND THE SCOPE OF MY TESTIMONY DISCUSS THOSE STANDARDS AND THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO SHOULD SET THE STANDARDS. BUT YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT THOSE STANDARDS THAT ARE ALSO PART OF GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT CALLS FOR INCREASE AT FIRST INCREASE EVALUATION WHETHER NOT UTILITY IS COMPLYING WITH THEM. AND SECOND INCREASE ENFORCEMENT IF THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING WITH THEM SO DO ONE HIGHLY THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT NOT THE NATURE OF MY COMMENTS I COULD ASK FOR THE NEXT TEN HOURS BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD I'VE. DONE WITH MY TIME BUT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE A JOINT -- CONCURRENCE ISSUED BY -- THE PRESIDENT -- MICHAEL PICKER AND TO COMMISSIONER MARTHA GOES MON. ON DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT -- PRETTY MUCH DENIED -- TESTY GINNY'S REQUEST. TO LET RATES THREE COMPENSATE THEM FOR SOME LOSSES A QUORUM RELATED TO A WILDFIRE. YES CENTER. IN THAT OUR DOCUMENT -- THERE ARE A FEW LINES THAT I WANT TO JUST KIND OF READ IF IT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIR. JUST TO ASK IN TERMS OF WHETHER. YOU UNDERSTAND -- SPECIFICALLY WHAT. WHAT THE COMMISSIONERS ARE MAKING REFERENCE TO AND WHETHER THAT PERTAINS? TO THE GOVERNOR'S RULE ON THE QUESTION WOULD BE. IS THE GOVERNOR SATISFYING THE REQUEST OF THE COMMISSIONERS. IN HIS -- RECOMMENDATION DOESN'T COVER THE KIND OF THE BREATH OF WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING. FROM THE LEGISLATURE SO IN THE LETTER. THEY BOTH SAID WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. TO AFFIRMATIVELY ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF LIABILITY CALCULATION AND COST ALLOCATION AND INSTANCES WHEN UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. HE'S IMPLICATED IN PRIVATE PROPERTY. AND THEY GO ON TO SAY THE ABILITY TO DO A MORE NUANCED ASSESSMENT A FULL. COULD BE I HELP FOR REGULATORY TOOL RESPECTFULLY ASK LEGISLATURE. TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE. AND THEN FINALLY WE WERE IT RESPECTFULLY URGE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO FOR FROM ITALY ADDRESS THE ISSUES. OF LIABILITY CALCULATION COST ALLOCATION INSTANCES. WHEN YOU TO LIDDY INFRASTRUCTURES IMPLICATED IN PRIVATE PROPERTY LOSS SO. WOULD YOU A IS IT. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. YES SENATOR -- THAT CONCURRENCE IS. FROM THE SAN DIEGO WE MY DECISION EYES YOU MENTIONED AND IT IDENTIFIES TWO ISSUES AND I'VE TOUCH BRUTE BRIEFLY ON THEM I WANNA CLARIFY WILL THAT FURTHER. THE FIRST IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIABILITY THE COURTS. AND I'D LIKE USE ANALOGY OF A PIE THAT ONCE THE LIABILITIES DETERMINED EITHER BY SETTLEMENT OR BY JUDGMENTS. YOU HAVE A PIE BEEN SHIRTS IS GOING TO COVER SOME OF THAT. BUT THE REMAINING THE REMAINDER OF THAT PIE GOES PROBABLY. TO APPLICATION FOR COST RECOVERY AT THE COMMISSION. THE DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF COSTS WHICH IS THE SECOND PART OF THAT CONCURRENCE IS ABOUT HOW YOU SLICE OF PIE. AND SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION. THE FIRST STEP IS REDUCING THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE PIE. BECAUSE ONCE A LIABILITY HAS ACCRUED. HOUSE TO BE PAID BY SOMEBODY. JUST BASIC MATH. AND YOU COULD RIGHT NOW ENTERED THE EXISTING SITUATION IS EITHER GOING TO SHAREHOLDERS OR RATE PAYERS. THE GOES TO SHAREHOLDERS. HIS DRAWBACKS TO IT AND LEAD TO HIGHER COST OF BORROWING. MAKES IT HARDER TO INSURANCE AND ULTIMATELY. THOSE TWO THINGS LEAD TO HIGHER RATES. IT GOES TO RATEPAYERS. OBVIOUSLY THAT MEANS THE RATES GO UP [inaudible] AND SO. THAT'S IS A TWO PART PROBLEM AND THE FIRST PART INVERSE CONDITION REFORM AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR GOES TO THE CALCULATION Y. BILLY. THE SECOND PART IS HOW THE COMMISSION ALLOCATE COSTS. AND TO ANSWER QUESTION. I BELIEVE -- MICHAEL PICKER BELIEVES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES ADDRESS HIS. COMMENTS NOT CONCURRENCE. THANK YOU HAVE YOU -- BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE DECISION BY THE LIL LEG LEDGE COUNCIL BASICALLY OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL THAT WAS -- AN OPINION ISSUED JULY FIFTH. REGARDING A STATUTORY MENDING OF THE CONSTITUTION AND I THINK IT GETS TO THE SOME OF THE PIE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND ARE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE OF THE LETTER THEIR OPINION AS IT'S THE PIN OPINION THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY NOT BY A STATUTORY MEASURE EITHER AMEND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. OR INTERPRET THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION A MATTER THAT CONFLICTS. WITH THE JUDICIAL CONSTRUCTION. SO WOULD YOU [inaudible] OF CONSIDER THAT. A CONFLICT WITH OUR ABILITY TO FACT KIND OF THE SIZE OF THE PIE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT NECESSARILY. BUT YOU KNOW THE THE ALLOCATION OF OF OVER. OR OR ASSIGNING BLAME TO THOSE SET THAT MAY SHARE BLAME AND AN INCIDENT THAT. CAN WE INFLUENCE THE SIZE OF THE PIE IN ITS ENTIRETY. SENATOR I BELIEVE MICHAEL WORE OF ADDRESS THE QUESTION CONSTITUTIONALITY. OF THE PROPOSAL AND IN HIS TESTIMONY LAST WEEK HE SAID THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL. I AGREE IT IS ASSESSMENT -- THE DOCTORATE INVERSE CONDEMNATION SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE HAS BASICALLY BEEN BASED ON INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION.% PREVIOUSLY SPACE OFFER COMMENT COMMON LAW TOWARD PROPERTY LAW AND AND I I I BELIEVE THAT IS APPROPRIATE AND AND LEGAL -- FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO ACT AND I CONSISTENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BUT AS I SAID EARLIER THAT QUESTION WILL LIKELY BE CITED BY COURT IF THIS PROPOSAL OR SOMEWHERE ONE BECOMES LAW -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I I TO A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT. USING FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S. AND THE STANDARDS USED FOR THEM AND APPLYING THOSE TO UTILITIES. SO SOME BASIC QUESTIONS OF FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. IS THAT PUBLICLY OWNED ORDERS BUT OUR DEEP SHAREHOLDERS IN THAT. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M NOT -- AND EXPERIENCE LOOKED FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD APPLY TO BOTH INVESTOR AND PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES. AGAIN I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE IF WE HAVE THE THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY COMPANY YOU HAVE CEOS IF SHAREHOLDERS YOU HAVE. GUARANTEED RATES OF RETURN FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT FOR FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. SO WOULDN'T IT BE YOUR LAST ONE OF YOUR LAST CMMENT TO SAID ONCE LIABILITIES DETERMINED. SOMEONE HOUSE TO PAY. THAT'S TRUEFOR FOR ANYTHING. ANYTHING THAT ANY OF US TO SOMEONE HAS TO PAY. SO WE HAVE INSURANCE WE'VE ENOUGH INSURANCE. AND IF WE DON'T THEN IF IT'S BEFORE THE OWNERS OF IT THEN WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. AND SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK TWO WAYS TO PREVENT. GETTING TO THAT POINT SO YOU WORK IT SEEMS THAT WE'RE WERE STARTING AT THE END RATHER THAN STARTING AT THE BEGINNING. AND AT THE BEGINNING WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT RESPONSIBILITY THERE IS TO AVOID GETTING TO THIS POINT. SO IT GOES TO THE PREVENTION GOES TO EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND AS THE GOOD SENATOR SAID. WE WERE TAKING CARE OF THEM. AND WE'RE NOW LOOKING FOR WAYS TO THE END THAT FIT SUPPORT CHOICE OF WORDS. BUT IT IT'S A WORD THAT'S BEING USED BY MANY WHO CONTACT MY OFFICE. ON MANY OR TALKING ABOUT IT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A BAILOUT. FOR THE UTILITIES. THAT ISN'T OUR PURPOSE. IT ABSOLUTELY IS NOT OUR PURPOSE WE WANT TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THOSE WHO ARE YOU. RECEIVING THE BENEFIT. HERE ELECTRICITY IT -- ALL OF THE UTILITIES. WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT IF SOMEONE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP AN AREA SAFE KEEP IT FROM. IGNITING. BUT THEY DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND I I PAID. STILL HAVE NOT HEARD THAT. I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING. WHAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WERE INSTEAD LOOKING AT THE? THE TAIL END AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROTECT. SOMEONE WHO AREN'T ENTITY THAT HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF THE FIRES. I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT. BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY HAVING TO DO WITH THE FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S. DO YOU SEE A DIFFERENCE SPECIFIC BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SALARIES WHEN IT COMES TO DIVIDENDS WHEN IT COMES TO RATE OF RETURN. FOR A UTILITY VERSUS THE FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. WELL YOU'RE. I I THINK YOU'VE. PUT YOUR FINGER ON IMPORTANT IMPORTANTISSUE AND I SHARE YOUR CONCERN AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS TO SEE A BAILOUT -- I WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE THIS IS BELL OUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HOLDS UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE IF ACT NEGLIGENTLY. BUT I THINK IT STRIKES A CAREFUL BALANCE BETWEEN HOLDING THEM I CAN'T ACCOUNTABLE ENACT NEGLIGENTLY. BUT NOT DONE MAKING THEM THE BACKSTOP FINANCIALLY FOR ALL NATURAL DISASTERS -- I AGREE WITH YOUR SECOND POINT CLEARLY A FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT IS DIFFERENT THAN A LARGE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY I I THINK THAT'S VERY CLEAR. HE DIDN'T IF. LIST SHARE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I THAT I ASK YOU IS. WHAT NEEDS TO BE PROVEN IN THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND? ONE OF THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS HAS TO DO WITH. THAT. THE THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE. THE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR HAD TWO BANDS UTILITIES. AND IF WE'RE AT THAT POINT IN THE HEAT SO THAT THEY'RE NOT THE INTEREST COMBINATIONS LIKE ON BECOME TOLD THAT IS PROVEN IS THAT TRUE. THAT SURE UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION ON ELM IS SUBSTANTIAL BECAUSE AND IF THEY'RE FOUND TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR OF THE FIRE THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE FOUND. STRICTLY LIVE ROOMS ARE CORRECT WELL THEY COULD BE THEY COULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL CAUSE BUT FOR EXAMPLE -- THEY COULD BE ACOSTA NOT ACTED NEGLIGENTLY ANYWAY. SO THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IS GOOD THAT DID. INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE -- PART OF THAT WORK IN THE FIRE BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ACTED NEGLIGENTLY AND THEIR NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS OF THE OTHER JURY INSTRUCTIONS BUT THAT IS ONE OF THEM. DOES THE UTILITY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK -- FOR INDEMNIFICATION IF THEY KNOW THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS RESPONSIBLE CAN THEY ALSO TAKE ACTION AGAINST A THIRD PARTY. I BELIEVE THE PANELISTS MUTILATES CAN SPEAK TO THIS BETTER THAN I CAN BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES THAT ARE ON THE POLLS. BUT THEY HAVE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS BUT THAT'S SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW AT YOUR OFFICE ON THAT AND TO CONFIRM THAT. AND THE REASON IT'S INDEMNIFICATION IS BECAUSE I ASSUME. THAT THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PARTY IS. SO THAT'S A CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP AND IF THEY HAVE A CONTRACT AND THAT PERSON WAS WITH THAT ENTITY RECEIPT WAS RESPONSIBLE. THEY CAN THEN SEEK INDEMNIFICATION FROM THEM RIGHT AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING SUBJECT TO BEAR FIND THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC CONTRACTS THAT MADE ME DIFFERENT SOME MATERIAL WAYS. AND THEN FINALLY. IF THIS BODY WERE DO DO ANYTHING REGARDING INVERSE CONDEMNATION CLEARLY AND GIVE HEARD FROM THE GET SENATOR REGARDING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OR QUESTIONS REGARDING CONSTITUTIONALITY. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THIS WOULD BE. IN LITIGATION FOR YEARS PERHAPS DECADES. WELL I I OF COURSE CAN'T SPECULATE HOW THE COURTS WILL TREAT THIS BUT I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A HOTLY DEBATED QUESTION THAT LIKELY MAKE IT MAKE ITS WAY TO THE COURT. AND THE COURTS WOULD BE FACED WITH THE QUESTION -- SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BY I CAN'T SPECULATE AS TO THE TIMELINESS TO WIN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE [inaudible] THANK YOU -- CENTER CAN HELP [inaudible] THINGS CHAIRMAN SO. I HESITATE TO PUT MY TOE IN THE WATER IF THE ATTORNEYS HAVE SPOKE BUT A SO THE CONSTITUTION DOES IT. DIFFERENTIATE FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S VERSES UTILITY COMPANIES. BUT NO DE NEITHER OF THEM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE CONSTANT COULD SO. HOW CAN WE DIFFERENTIATE THEM OUT WHY CAN A COURT? AND MAKE A DECISION ON ONE AND NOT THE OTHER WHAT HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK. WELL THE THE CASES WHICH I REFERENCE. RELY ON PUBLIC POLICY DISTINCTIONS AND THEY MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT THE FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT SO UNIQUELY SITUATED. AND SOCIETY BECAUSE OF THE THE THE RISKY ACTIVITY THAT THEY UNDERTAKE. THE BENEFIT THAT THEY PROVIDE AND THAT'S THE REASON CITED. SO IF I WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE REASON THIS STRIP CLUB BILL OR INVERSE CONDEMNATION. IS USE IS BECAUSE UTILITY COMPANIES ARE OF PSEUDO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES THAT CAN TAKE PROPERTY THROUGH A IN THE DOMAIN. IS THAT THE TRIGGER TO APPLY STRICT LIABILITY OR INVERSE CONDEMNATION. THE OTHER ONE WAS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO PASS ON THE COST THE RATES AND THAT THE COURTS DIDN'T CHIP IT DIDN'T DISCUSS THE FACT IT THAT QUESTION IS SUBJECT TO REASONABLENESS REVIEW. AT THE CPUC AND SO AS SOON THAT THE COST WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO AND RATES. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THOUGH RIGHT SEEMS LIKE LOTS OF TIMES UTILITY COMPANIES ARE OR WILL THEY HAVE TO TO PAY THE DAMAGES. AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IF THEY'RE NEGLIGIBLE THEY'LL PAY BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOW WITH THE THE STRICT LIABILITY OR AN INVERSE COME NATION. IF THERE IS A POLL THAT MEETS EVERY PROPER STANDARDS BEEN YOU KNOW. LOOK AT BY THE FEW SEATS A PERFECT CONDITION AND A TRUCK HITS THE POLL. KNOCKS THE LINES DOWN STARTS A FIRE THE CREATES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE OBVIOUSLY THE PERSON DRIVING THE TRUCK CAN'T AFFORD OF CLAIM DOT PAY THOSE CLAIMS. IS THAT NGUYEN STRICKLAND ABILITY OR INVERSE CONDITIONAL COME IN AND BE. THE UTIL COMPOSE BEHELD THE PAY. I I'M RELUCTANT TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC HYPOTHETICALS BUT YES I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT'S COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN A UTILITY. TO NOT AT NIGHT WITH NEGLIGENTLY BUT THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IS GONE. SOMEHOW IMPLICATED IN A FIRE IF THEY'RE THEY'RE 1% RESPONSIBLE THEY WOULD INCUR A 100% OF THE OBLIGATION CORRECT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A CORRECT UNDERSTANDING YES OKAY THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M DEATHLY NON ATTORNEY SO MY QUESTIONS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- LOOKING -- FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S ARE. PUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO MITIGATE DISASTERS. UTILITIES COULD IN [inaudible] STRUCTURES THAT POTENTIALLY CREATE DISASTERS [inaudible] THROUGH [inaudible] WHATEVER. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME RECONCILING WHY WE WOULD WANT TO BASE POLICY ON ONE MAN I FIND THEM VERY VERY DIFFERENT. CAN NUKES GIVE ME SOME LOGICAL EXPLANATION. WELL I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE SIMILAR IN THAT THEIR BOATS -- INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE GREAT BENEFITS WITH WITH RISK. AND SO I THINK YOU'VE PUT. YOUR FINGER ON A POTENTIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE THE SAME. BUT THEY'RE SIMILAR. HE HAD DONE DOESN'T FEEL THAT SIMILAR TO ME I GUESS. I'M JUST JUST SAM PHAM. CONSIDERING THE LEGAL BATTLES THAT. IF WE MAKE A DECISION HERE. AND BUT THEN I BECAUSE I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THERE'S A BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF DOING ANY ANY CHANGES HERE -- WHAT ASSURE YOU WOULD THAT MEAN FOR US TRYING TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA? THESE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DRAWN UP AND UP SUPERVISED BY THE P. YOU SEE. THAT THE LANGUAGE IS PRETTY LOOSE IN THERE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IS COUNTY YOU GOT A TIME FRAME BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO STRIVE FOR THAT -- ONCE THE PLANS IN IT BEEN APPROVED YOU'VE GOT A TIME FRAME FOR THAT THEY'LL BE YOU KNOW EXECS AND THE NATION'S -- THE EFFICACY OF THAT WE HAVE TO STRIVE FOR THAT -- UNDER THE NOSE BUT THERE'S WHAT SMOKE IN THE AIR. TEN STRIVING FOR SOMETHING. ISN'T GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR SOME OF US. WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR HARD DEADLINES. AND REAL RESULTS. SO THAT WE CAN ASSURE OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WERE ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD HERE. BECAUSE I JUST FOR SEE IN ADDITION OF LEGAL BATTLES HAS SOME THESE MITIGATION PLANS TAKE YEARS TO DEVELOP. YEARS TO IMPLEMENT. AND IN MEANTIME MILLIONS AND MILLIONS MORE ACRES ACRES A CALIFORNIA. BURNT. AND MORE PEOPLE DIE. AND WERE AND WE'RE NOT ANY CLOSER TO THAT. AND SO. I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION AND YOU MAY A BILL ANSWER THIS -- BUT I AM PUZZLED AS PUZZLE ME SINCE THE VERY FIRST MINUTE I READ THIS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WHY THE DATE JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND? EIGHTEEN WHY IS THAT DATE THERE WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE LOOKING AT GOING FORWARD WHY SHOULDN'T THIS BE STANDARDS APPLY AFTER THE PLANS ARE IN PLACE. FOR PEOPLE. FOR THE UTILITIES AFTER THEY'VE BEEN AFTER THEY'VE BEEN INVESTIGATED TO BE SURE THERE ADEQUATE WHY SHOULD WE GO RETROACTIVELY WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE REST OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN YET THAT PROPOSAL ASKS US. TO DO SOMETHING GOING BACK IN TIME. AND WE DON'T KNOW. SIX HUNDRED AND AS OF TODAY SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES HAVE BURNED IN CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR. AND THAT WHO KNOWS WHERE IT'S WHERE IT'S WHERE IT'S GOING TO END WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE FURTHER [inaudible] POTENTIAL UTILITY. PROBLEMS OUT THERE THE COULD CONTRIBUTE TO ADDITIONAL FIRE SO. SO EXPLAIN TO ME THE LOGIC WHY WE WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT SAYS JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ANYWAY TO MITIGATE. THE POTENTIAL FUTURE FUTURE CHALLENGES. BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT DATE WAS ELECTED TO PRECLUDE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES FROM BEING -- FROM THIS PROPOSAL PLAN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES. AT ON THE TEAM IT -- I I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE IS A ABSOLUTE MUST DATE COULD BE A DIFFERENT DATES FOR THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE TO THE SIDE. AND THAT THAT DATE. IS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER KEEP. SEVEN MEMBER DOLLAR HERO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REAL QUICK QUESTION SO THE ONE THING I PICKED UP ON IN YOUR COMMENTS WAS. THE THAT THERE'S A DECISION MADE AT SOME POINT ABOUT. WHO PAYS THE RIGHT PAIR FOR THE INVESTOR? AND BUT WHAT I REALLY HEARD WAS THAT AT THE END THE RIGHT PAIR PICKS UP THE COST BECAUSE IF THEY CAN'T BORROW MONEY SO WHO MAKES THAT DETERMINATION. AND HOW IS THAT IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IN THIS WHOLE FROM SINCE I'VE BEEN LISTENING. IS THAT. YOU KNOW I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE RIGHT PAIR. NOT ONLY THE RIGHT PAIR BUT THE INSURER AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME PEOPLE AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF POWERS TO BE THAT TED WILL TAKE CARE OF THEIR SELVES HERE BUT THE RATE PARRIS THE GUYS ON THE HOOK EVERY SINGLE TIME SEEMS LIKE SO. WHO MAKES DECISION AND WIN A HOUSE THAT MADE IN THIS PROCESS? WELL THE THE DECISION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO HOLD UTILITY -- EXCUSE ME LET ME REPHRASE THAT THE DECISION OF WHETHER NOT TO ALLOW UTILITY RECOVER COST. IS MADE AT THE CPC TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THEIR CONDUCT FOR THE VAN THAT AT ISSUE [inaudible] ON THERE'S AN EVALUATION THEIR CONDUCT REGARDLESS OF THE IMPLICATION HAS TO INSURANCE MARKET REGARDLESS FOR THEM IMPLICATE IMPLICATIONS HOUSE FOR THE CAPITAL MARKETS -- OUR PREVIOUS DECISION THIS PAST YEAR AS WE ALL KNOW BECAUSE A LOT OF DISCUSSION AFTERWARDS. ON BECAUSE THAT DECISION WAS FOCUSED JUST ON THE THE FACTS THAT DAY AND AND THOSE DECIDED BASED OFF THOSE FACTS AND EACH OF THESE CASES ARE FOR FOR OUR DIFFERENT AND BASED ON THE FACTS. IS NOT A CONSIDERATION OF THE THE REPORTS TAX IF YOU WILL AND I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT REDACTED THEN TAX RATE HERE'S OUR ANYWAY NOT SIGNIFICANT. BUT THE VALUATION IS OF WHETHER NOT TO UTILITY CONDUCTING THEMSELVES IN A PRUDENT WAY AND THAT'S EVALUATION THAT HAPPENS AT THE CDC [inaudible] RIGHT. AND THAT CONCLUDES THAT THIS PRESENTATION THANK YOU MISTER RALPH -- WELL DONE I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME HERE BEFORE AT THIS -- CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. THIS TIME ALTERNATE OVER TO OTHER CO CHAIR HOLDEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I ALSO LIKE TO JOIN IN THANK YOU FOR A VERY CREDIBLE PRESENTATION AND WE APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT. THE FIRST PANELISTS ARE WE'RE JUST BE MEAN PANEL. ONE AND SO WE WILL CALL FORWARD. THOSE PANELISTS FIRST WOULD BE JOHN DUNBAR MAYOR. TOWN OF YOUNG BILL CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. TO BE A PART OF THE SPELL AS WELL AS DIANE DILLON. SUPERVISOR NAPA COUNTY COUNTY SUPERVISOR ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. REX FRASER PRESIDENT PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. JOHN FISKE ATTORNEY AT LAW CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. AND PATRICK MCCOLLUM'S UP FROM. THE ASHES. AND I THINK A IN THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU WERE CALLED UP A IS HOW YOU PERCENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'M JOHN DUNBAR MAYOR OF THE TOWN COUNCIL. IN A BOARD MEMBER OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU TODAY. MY COMMUNITY IS A SMALL TOWN IN NAPA VALLEY. WHICH FOUND ITSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRE STORMS THAT DEVASTATED THE NORTH BAY LAST OCTOBER. THE FORECAST THAT PRECEDED THOSE WILDFIRES. INCLUDED LOW HUMIDITY AND SEVERE WINDS TRUSTING IN OUR SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS IN THE SIXTY SEVENTY MILE AN HOUR RANGE. ACCORDING TO CAL FIRES INVESTIGATION. AT LEAST A DOZEN OF THE SIXTEEN FIRES THAT WERE IGNITED IN NAPA AND NEIGHBORING CINEMA COUNTIES. WERE CAUSED BY QUOTE. ELECTRIC POWER IN DISTRIBUTION LINES CONDUCTORS AND THE FAILURE OF POWER POLES UNQUOTE. JUST A FEW HOURS FIRE BURNED THROUGH ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS TAKING LIVES DESTROYING HUNDREDS OF HOMES AND BUSINESSES. AS SCORCHING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. OF PRIME AGRICULTURAL LAND AND OPEN SPACE. APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND OF MY TOWN'S THREE THOUSAND RESIDENTS. OUR AGING VETERANS THAT THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD CALIFORNIA VETERANS HOME. HAS THE HIGH WINDS PUSH FLAMES INTO THE DIRECTION OF THE HOME. IN THE AIR QUALITY REACHED A HAZARDOUS LEVEL. EVACUATION PLANS WERE ACTIVATED. DOZENS OF AMBULANCES IN BUSES RACED TO THE CAMPUS WHERE VETERANS HOME STAFF. WORK WITH POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL. TO GET THE RESIDENTS BOARDED AND HEADED TO SAFER LOCATIONS. FORTUNATELY FOR USTHE WINDS CHANGED DIRECTION AND WE AVOIDED A DIRECT HIT BY THOSE FIRES. BY THE NARROWEST MARGIN WE ESCAPED EVEN GREATER HUMAN AND PROPERTY LOSS. I TELL THE STORY IS A REAL EXAMPLE OF HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF WILDFIRE IN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. UTILITIES SHOULD BE EQUALLY PREPARED. AN EQUALLY RESPONSIVE IN SUCH DANGEROUS CONDITIONS. FOR DECADES ELECTED LEADERS HAVE RELIED ON THE LAWS TO MAKE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND BUSINESSES HOLE AFTER A DISASTER. CAUSED BY AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. WE COMMEND THE GOVERNOR'S SUPPORT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH HIS COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY FIRE. WE APPLAUD NEW INVESTMENTS IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION MUTUAL AID AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS. WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR ON HIS EMPHASIS ON SAFETY RESPONSE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION. HOWEVER WE OPPOSE HIS PROPOSAL TO CHANGE INVERSE CONDEMNATION RULES. I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE WAYS IN WHICH INVERSE CONDEMNATION. THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT LEGAL TOOL TO VICTIMS OF WILDFIRES THAT WERE CAUSED BY UTILITIES. THIS IS HOW WE REBUILD OUR COMMUNITIES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALREADY ARE FACED WITH SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS FROM THESE WILDFIRES INCLUDING THE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TASK. OF HELPING THE RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES BECOME WHOLE AND RETURN TO A RELATIVELY NORMAL LIFE. PROPOSALS TO CHANGE INVERSE CONDEMNATION RULES OPEN THE DOOR TO ALLOW UTILITIES TO PASS OFF LIABILITY TO OTHER ENTITIES. INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND REDUCE DAMAGE RECOVERY THE VICTIMS WILL WOULD RECEIVE. RESIDENTS IN CITIES CAN'T WAIT YEARS FOR COURT TO DECIDE. IF WE CAN REBUILD OUR BILL THE CHANGES SHOULD NOT. BECOME A BURDEN FOR OUR CITIES ELECTRICITY DOES NOT HAVE TO COME AT THE EXPENSE OF PUBLIC SAFETY. MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND WILD FIRE PROTECTION OR MORE IMPORTANT THAN MAKING QUICK DECISIONS. GIVEN THE SHORT TIME REMAINING IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION DO YOU HAVE THE TIME TO EVALUATE PROPERLY AND COMPLETELY. THE DETAILS AND GOVERNOR BROWN'S PROPOSAL IN ORDER TO MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS OR CHANGE THE LAW. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO THE LIABILITY RULES LIKELY IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT VIOLATES AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO RECEIVE JUST COMPENSATION. AND SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN A COURT OF LAW. I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO REJECT REJECT THE PROPOSAL TO CHANGE INVERSE CONDEMNATION RULES. AND CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS MUTUAL AID AND INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE. OUR COLLECTIVE FOCUS SHOULD REMAIN ON HOW WE CAN PARTNER WITH THESE UTILITIES SO THEY CAN OPERATE MORE SMARTLY AND MORE SAFELY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR CONSIDERATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITYTO PARTICIPATE AND PROVIDE. COMMENTS TO THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I'M DIANE DILLON I'M A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR THE FOR THIRD DISTRICT AND NAPA COUNTY ALL OF ALMOST ALL OF THE TEARS THREE LANDS DESIGNATED BY CAL FIRE IN MY SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT. I'M ALSO ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES SEE SECOND I'M SPEAKING ON THEIR BEHALF TODAY. IT WAS ONLY MONTHS AGO THAT WE IN THE NORTH BAY WERE RAVAGED BY FIRE. THE TYPES FIRE STARTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF MY HOME. MY COMMUNITY MY COMMUNITIES STILL CONTINUE TO RECOVER. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE WILD FIRES IN CALIFORNIA BURNED OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AND TRAGICALLY TOOK FORTY THREE LIVES. FIRES ARE CONTINUING TO BURNING CALIFORNIA'S WE ALL KNOW AS WE SIT HERE. AND WE MUST REMEMBER THAT ANY CHANGES THAT WE MAKE TO LAWS TODAY. WHAT IMPACT FUTURE FIRE VICTIMS AND WE WILL HAVE FUTURE FIRE VICTIMS? IT MAY IMPACT CURRENT FIRE VICTIMS IF THAT DATE ISN'T CHANGED. C. SACKS STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT LEGAL STANDARD IS CRITICAL TO COMPEL UTILITIES TO INVEST IN SAFETY. SAFETY NEEDS TO BE OUR MAIN FOCUS WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT PREVENTION. SAFETY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR UTILITIES. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FOREST HEALTH. RESILIENCY AND LAND USE WE DO NOT NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON CHANGING LONGSTANDING LIABILITY LAWS THAT HAVE PROTECTED VICTIMS. NAPA COUNTY MAY NOT BE ON FIRE RIGHT NOW. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A HARM PROBABLY WILL BE AT SOME POINT AND THIS PROPOSAL WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT. FIRE VICTIMS IN THE FUTURE LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO FAIRLY AND SWIFTLY BECOME BEEN SATED FROM FIRES THAT UTILITIES COST. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ASKED THE COURT TO BALANCE THE BENEFIT OF ELECTRICITY. TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE BURNING DOWN. HOW CAN THAT BE DONE HOW IS THAT FAIR TO VICTIMS? THIS IS A VERY RADICAL POLICY CHANGE THIS PROPOSAL WILL SHIFT LIABILITIES TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TRYING TO RECOVER. AND WHAT IS MOST GLARING. IS THAT WE ARE DOING THIS IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE IOUS HAVE NOT BEEN MEETING THEIR OBLIGATIONS. TUESDAY NIGHT I HELD A MEETING IN ANGLE AND THE COMMUNITY OF THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHICH INCLUDES A TWELVE HUNDRED STUDENTS FOUR YEAR LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE. I'M UP AT THE COMMUNITY THAT'S AND TIER THREE THAT HASN'T BURNED IN FIFTY YEARS THAT'S VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE. AND I HELD THE MEETING TO FOCUS ON PGA IN ME AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE COMMUNITY THE ARE TRYING DESPERATELY TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE NOT DONE AND SHOULD HAVE DONE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. HAPPY TO SEND YOU ALL PHOTOS OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUND NOW. AND WHAT THAT WILL MEAN IN TERMS OF THIS POLICY CHANGE. BECAUSE IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW. TO MAKE IT SAFER. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE WAY IN WHICH THEY'LL BE JUDGED ON HAVING THAT HAVING MET THEIR SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE INVERSE CONDEMNATION TO BRING A LARGE WELL FUNDED UTILITIES TO THE TABLE TO SETTLE FOR DAMAGES RATHER THAN SPEND YEARS AND YEARS IN COURT UNDER NEGLIGENCE SUITS. SMALL COUNTIES HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND WE BRING UTILITIES TO COURT UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION EVEN WHEN THEY ACTED NEGLIGENTLY BECAUSE IT BRINGS THEM TO THE TABLE SOONER FOR SETTLEMENT. WE HAVE TO START PROVIDING SERVICES WE HAVE TO PUT OUR COMMUNITIES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND WE HAVE TO BE IN COURT FOR YEARS POTENTIALLY WITH THEM TO BRING US TO SETTLEMENT ARM. THAT'S THE CURRENT SITUATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING AWAY THAT INCENTIVE FOR THEM. SO WE HAVEN'T SHOWN WHERE THE INCENTIVE IS FOR PGM NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE WHERE IS THE INCENTIVE TO GET THEM TO GO TO THAT HIGHER BAR THAT SAN DIEGO HAS SHOWN CAN BE DONE. I'M WE ARE SOLUTION ORIENTED. C. SACK ONCE THE STATE TO POKE US ON HOW WE CAN REDUCE OUR RISK OF WILDFIRE NOT ON HOW TO SHIFT LIABILITY. SO LET'S WORK TOGETHER FOR THAT GOAL TO PROTECT ALL OF OUR CITIZENS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU [inaudible] REX [inaudible] SENATOR DODD. ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN AND MEMBERS OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS REX FRAZIER I'M PRESIDENT OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION OF HOME AND AUTO INSURERS OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT WILD FIRE PREVENTION. AND RESPONSE SINCE THE FALL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN PROPERTY INSURERS HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON FIRE RESPONSE. THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN WORKING TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY RELIEF SUCH AS ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES. AS WELL AS LONGER TERM BENEFITS SUCH AS HOME RECONSTRUCTION FUNDS AND VEHICLE REPLACEMENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN OVER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND INSURANCE CLAIMS FROM LAST YEAR'S FIRES. WITH INSURED LOSSES ESTIMATED TO REACH TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS. INSURERS HAVE HANDLED THESE CLAIMS WHILE REMAINING SOLVENT. AND WITHOUT ASKING THE LEGISLATURE FOR ANY RELIEF. OBVIOUSLY THE WORK HAS NOT LET UP IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH THE LATEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE EVENT BEING THE CAR FIRE IN AND AROUND READING. WHICH HAS CLAIMED LIVES IN A REACH INSURED PROPERTY LOSSES OF UP TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. INSURERS PRESENTLY HAVE HUNDREDS OF CLAIMS PERSONNEL ON THE GROUND RESPONDING TO FIRES ACROSS THE STATE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF FIRE RELATED PROPERTY LOSS IS PAID FOR BY GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE INSURANCE WHICH REALLY MEANS TAXPAYERS BUSINESSES HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS. AND IN TOO MANY CASES THEY'RE UNINSURED HOME LOSSES INCLUDING OVER THREE HUNDRED SUCH CASES RELATED TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY FIRES. IT IS DIFFICULT OPERATE AN INSURANCE BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA LAW PREVENTS INSURERS FROM CHARGING ACTUAR REALLY SOUND RATES IN MANY HIGH FIRE AREAS. IN FACT STATE REGULATIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE USE OF FORWARD LOOKING CLIMATE MODELS OR THE ACTUAL COST OF REINSURANCE WHEN DEVELOPING INSURANCE RATES. THIS CAUSES INSURERS TO CONSIDER A PARTIAL OR TOTAL WITHDRAWAL FROM HIGH RISK COMMUNITIES. WHICH UPSETS BOTH POLICY HOLDERS AND POLICYMAKERS. AND TRAPS INSURERS BETWEEN EXPECTATIONS OF UNLIMITED SERVICE TO ALL COMMUNITIES AND RATE LEVELS THAT ARE UNSUSTAINABLE. IN MARCH WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WERE BLAMING LONGSTANDING LIABILITY RULES AND CLIMATE CHANGE FOR JEOPARDIZING THEIR SOLVENCY. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR UTILITIES HAVE DECADES OF HAD DECADES OF WARNING ABOUT FOREST CONDITIONS. DEVELOPMENT AND MOVIE AREAS AND IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO A GOVERNOR'S BLUE RIBBON FIRE COMMISSION CHAIRED BY FORMER SENATOR BILL CAMPBELL. CLOSELY EXAMINED THESE ISSUES AND THIS REPORT STATED. FOR MOST FOREMOST AMONG THOSE LESSONS IS A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL TO PRIORITIZE COMPETING BUT IMPORTANT POLICY GOALS PUBLIC POLICY GOALS. VEGETATION AND FUEL MANAGEMENT HABITAT PRESERVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HAVE OFTEN CONFLICTED WITH SOUND FIRE SAFE PLANNING IN THE DEVELOPMENT. OF WILDLAND AREAS. UNLESS AND UNTIL PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS OF GOVERNMENT. MUSTER THE POLITICAL WILL TO PUT THE PROTECTION OF OF LIFE AND PROPERTY AHEAD OF COMPETING POLITICAL AGENDAS THESE TRAGEDIES ARE CERTAIN TO REPEAT. LET'S NOT LET THE IOUS TAKE DECADES OF WARNING AND SHIFT THE NARRATIVE TO A YEAR OF EXCUSES SURROUNDING A NEW NORMAL. IF INSURANCE THOUGHT THE CLIMATE CHANGES MAKING CALIFORNIA UNINSURABLE. WE WOULD SAY SO. THE BIGGEST FIRE RELATED OR THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY IS EXCESSIVE FUEL LOAD IN THE WEEK. WHICH CAN BE MITIGATED. I USE WANT OTHERS TO PAY FOR THE FIRE LOSSES CAUSED BY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY HAVE INSTALLED USING THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN. THEY WANT A FINANCIAL SHIFT TO VULNERABLE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED LOSSES WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PRETENSE OF CARING ABOUT THE MASSIVE TRADE OFF THAT THIS BAILOUT ENTAILS. INCLUDING HIGHER TAXES HIGHER INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND COMPLETE DEVASTATION OF UNINSURED HOMEOWNERS. IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO SOLVE ONE PROBLEM BY CREATING MANY OTHERS. IN THE CASE OF INSURERS RECOVERING FROM UTILITY RECOVERIES FROM UTILITIES GO STRAIGHT TO REFUNDS OF INSURANCE CUSTOMER DEDUCTIBLES. INSURANCE COMPANIES DO NOT PROFIT FROM SUBJUGATION STATE RULES REQUIRE THE REMAINING RECOVERIES TO BE USED FOR LOWER INSURANCE RATES. I USE ARE ASKING FOR THE BEST OF ALL WORLDS SOCIALIZING THEIR COSTS AND PRIVATIZING THEIR BENEFITS. THEY WANT TO WE'LL GOVERNMENT POWER WHILE BEING TREATED LIKE AN ORDINARY BUSINESS. WHEN YEARS ARE GOOD THEY WANT TO BE TREATED LIKE NORMAL BUSINESSES DELIVERING SUPERIOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE? WHEN YEARS ARE BAD THEY ASK THE PUBLIC TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS? COURTS HAVE SAID THAT I USE WITH THEIR MONOPOLY ADVANTAGE OUR EQUIVALENT TO PUBLIC UNIVERSE PUBLIC UTILITIES. WHICH IS WHAT ALLOWS A PROPERTY OWNER TO SEE WHEN I OWE YOU FOR JUST COMPENSATION. AND WHEN IN UTILITY DOES CAUSE A FIRE EVEN WITH INVERSE CONDEMNATION SUITS FIRE VICTIMS TYPICALLY SETTLE FOR BETWEEN FORTY AND 60% OF THE OVERALL DAMAGE. ON TOP OF THAT UTILITIES COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HELPS THEM PAY FOR THIS PARTIAL LIABILITY. UTILITIES ARE STILL NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS MATH. AND WANT TO WALK AWAY WITH PAYING NOTHING. OR TO ENGAGE IN GRINDING NEGLIGENCE LITIGATION FOR YEARS AGAINST THOSE WHO HAVE INDOOR DISASTER. A STATUTORY AMENDMENT OF COURT FOUND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IS OBVIOUSLY CONTENTIOUS AND IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT A BAILOUT BILL ENACTED WILL IMMEDIATELY BE CHALLENGED IN COURT. OR POSSIBLY REFERRED AT THE BALLOT. P. JEANNINE EDISON. CURRENTLY HAVE COURT CHALLENGES SICK TO THEIR GOVERNMENT LIABILITY REX CAN YOU BRING YOUR COMMENTS CIRCLE I WILL OF THE I DO HOPE FOR SOME ALLOWANCE WE'VE HEARD MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES OF MISINFORMATION FROM PEOPLE WHO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT INSURANCE TALKING ABOUT INSURANCE. I WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR A FEW EXTRA MINUTES OF AT BATS GLOBAL BUDGETS RECOGNIZE WE SAID AT THE VERY BEGINNING WITH THE LIBERALS ARE GOING TO BE GOING FORWARD AND WE DO HAVE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS AND OTHERS HAVE ALSO WE'RE TRYING TO MANAGE A TIME SO THAT WE CAN. GET TO QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL ITSELF AND ALSO FROM WE DO I ALL CLOSE THANK YOU. WE DO HOPE THAT THIS BODY WILL SHIFT ITS FOCUS TOWARDS BETTER VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THERE'S TOO MUCH FUEL IN THE MOVIE. IF THERE ARE BARRIERS TO FUEL REDUCTION WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU -- BY CHANGING LIABILITY RULES WILL LEAD TO MORE FIRES AND NOT LESS. WE KNOW FROM PREVIOUS TESTIMONY THE UTILITIES CAN CHOOSE TO OPERATE IN A SAFER MANNER. INSURERS ARE COMMITTED TO THE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD AND WE URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO FOCUS ON STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING THE RISK OF FUTURE FIRES. AND TO IMPROVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF I'LL USE TO THEIR RATE PAYERS ND TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND JUST KNOW THAT IF WE DON'T IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO FINISH YOUR COMPLETED STATEMENT THAT WE WILL RECEIVE IT IN WRITING WHICH WE HAVE YOURS. BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TO IN A YEAR WILL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY MAYBE EVEN AT SOME OF THE COMMENTS I THINK THAT REAL CHANCE PRESENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. MY NAME IS JOHN FISKE I AM AN ATTORNEY. AND I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THOUSANDS OF SURVIVORS. INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES RANCHERS FARMERS AND THE SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES WHO LOST THEIR HOMES IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I ALSO REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE PUBLIC ENTITIES. CONTAX PAIR RESOURCE AND RECOVERY ACTIONS. WE OPPOSE ANY CHANGE TO INVERSE CONDEMNATION. INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS A CONSTITUTIONAL. NO FAULT CAUSE OF ACTION. THAT HELPS FACILITATE EFFICIENT RESOLUTION. IN THE AFTERMATH OF UTILITY CAUSED WILDFIRES. HOMEOWNERS HAVE LIMITED A L. E. ALTERNATIVE LIVING EXPENSES THAT MAY LAST ONLY ONE OR TWO YEARS. AND IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT HOMEOWNERS ACHIEVE EFFICIENT RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS FOR UNDER INSURED LOSSES IN ORDER TO REBUILD AND RECOVER. WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENT FROM RESPONSIBLE I USE PEOPLE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF HOMEOWNERS SIMPLY CANNOT REBUILD. RANCHERS AND FARMERS DEPEND UPON EFFICIENT RESOLUTION. TO HELP REGROW LOST AVOCADO ORCHARDS OR VINEYARD CROPS BOTH OF WHICH WERE DESTROYED IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES. PUBLIC ENTITIES RECEIVE INITIAL HELP FROM FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS. HOWEVER EVEN AFTER ALL STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS ARE EXHAUSTED. LOCAL PET PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE STILL OUT TENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BECAUSE FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS CATEGORICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN LOSSES AND THE LOCAL COST SHARE IN FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS CAN THEMSELVES BE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. PARKS ROADS SIDEWALKS TREE REMOVAL OVERTIME WATERSHED RESTORATION WATER CONTAMINATION THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF UNCOVERED TAXPAYER LOSSES. INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS A PROPERTY OWNERS ABILITY. TO ENFORCE ITS CONSTITUTIONAL EMINENT DOMAIN RIGHTS. THE STANDARD ON INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS. WHETHER THE INJURY RESULTED FROM THE INTENDED USE AND DESIGN OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. IF THE INJURY DID NOT RESULT FROM THE INTENDED USE AND DESIGN OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. AN INVERSE CONDEMNATION DOES NOT APPLY. FOR EXAMPLE. IF A DRUNK DRIVER SWERVES A HUNDRED YARDS OFF THE ROAD. AND CRASHES INTO A UTILITY POLE. THERE IS NO LIABILITY UNDER UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION. BECAUSE THE INJURY DID NOT RESULT FROM THE INTENDED USE AND DESIGN. OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT STEPS ES DE GENIE HAS MADE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. INVESTING ONE BILLION DOLLARS TOWARD PREVENTION. IT IS UNDER THIS CURRENT LIABILITY STRUCTURE THAT HAS PRESSURED ES DE GENIE TO DO SO. AND HAS PASSED THE VERY QUESTION THAT INVERSE DEMANDS. IS MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. DESIGNED AND USED IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT CAUSE WILD FIRES. INVERSE CONDEMNATION EXISTS WHEN P. GENIE CREATES THAT RISK. IN IT'S INTENDED USE AND DESIGN. SECONDLY INVERSE CONDEMNATION REQUIRES A SHOWING THAT THE INTENDED USE AND DESIGN WAS A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IN CAUSING THE INJURY. IT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE THAT IF P. GENII IS 1% AT FAULT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A 100% OF THE DAMAGES UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION. THAT EXAMPLE IS SIMPLY FALSE. THAT CONCEPT OF APPORTIONMENT OF FAULT APPLIES IN NEGLIGENCE. INVERSE CONDEMNATION REQUIRES THAT THE INTENDED USE AND DESIGN. WAS A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IN CAUSING THE INJURY. IT IS A NO FAULT SYSTEM OF LIABILITY THAT ARISES WHEN I OWE YOU EXERCISES ITS EMINENT DOMAIN POWERS. GRANTED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] FURTHER IOUS ALREADY SPREAD THEIR RISK DURING AND AFTER CLAIMS PROCESS SEES BY CROSS CLAIMING AGAINST RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS INCLUDING ARBORISTS ENTRY TRIMMING Q. CREWS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN* COMMUNICATION CONTRIBUTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ITS RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SAN DIEGO FIRES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS FUN CONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT ROBS PROPERTY OWNERS OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. TWO ONE JUST COMPENSATION AND TO A JURY TRIAL. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OFF IT ALSO OPENS NEW PATHWAYS FOR PROTRACTED LITIGATION AGAINST LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES. AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF A RUSHED PROPOSAL. I UNDERSTAND A LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL OPINION ALSO DISCUSS IT DISCUSSES THE PROPOSALS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY. TO BE CLEAR. BUT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. DOES NOT APPLY THE LAUGHLIN FACTORS. THE FACTORS THAT APPEAR IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ARE NOT THE LOCK ON FACTORS. BUT ARE COMPLETELY MADE UP THEIR FABRICATED. I CANNOT FIND THEM ON THE LAW AND I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM. THE LAUGHLIN FACTORS THE ACTUAL LACHLAN FACTORS HAVE BEEN APPLIED ONLY TO FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT CASES. WHERE THE INJURY? IS THE EXACT FLOOD THAT THE DISTRICT SOUGHT TO PREVENT. CALIFORNIA COURTS HAVE REGULARLY AND REPEATEDLY REJECTED THE APPLICATION OF THE LACHLAN FACTORS TO ELECTRICAL UTILITY CASES NAMELY AND PAC BELL VERSUS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IT CAN YOU BRING YOUR YOUR REMARKS TOOK. YES I'VE GOT THIRTY SECONDS. EVERY MEMBER I'VE TALKED WITH BOTH ON AND OFF THIS COMMITTEE HAS PUBLICLY OPPOSED PASSED THROUGH OR SECURITIZATION OF LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENT CONDUCT. I HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM WHEN THE IOUS HAVE STOOD UP. AND EXPLAINED IF THE IOUS WERE NEGLIGENT THE SHAREHOLDERS WILL PAY. IF THIS COMMITTEE ELIMINATES INVERSE CONDEMNATION. THE ONE NO FAULT THEORY OF LIABILITY. ALL THAT IS LEFT IS NEGLIGENT LIABILITY. AT THAT POINT WHAT YOUR PASSING THROUGH. OR WHAT YOUR SECURITIZED ING IS NEGLIGENT LIABILITY. OF A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR PUT FOR PROFIT COMPANY. THIS THREATENS THE VERY POLICY BEHIND A. B. THIRTY THREE AND SP. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT YOU CANNOT BOTH ELIMINATE INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND ALSO PASS THROUGH OR SECURITIZED NO FAULT LIABILITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. XP THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SIGN PATRICK A COLUMN REPRESENTINGUP FROM THE ASHES. IT'S A BROAD COALITION OF MOSTLY HOMEOWNERS THAT LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES AND IN THE PRINTER AND SANTA BARBARA FIRES WAS ALSO SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S ALSO PRESCHOOLS. THOUGHTFUL SCHOOLS IT FARMS IT'S MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE. ITS CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND NOW JOINED BY THE HARD HOWARD JARVIS ORGANIZATION. IT'S CONSUMER GROUPS ZOOMER ATTORNEYS WORKING WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WE ARE BROAD COALITION. WE MADE OUR CASE AROUND INVERSE CONDEMNATION WERE ASKING YOU. YOU ARE HEARING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO HEAR IT AND THINK IT. BUT WE HAVE PUT A MAJOR CASE TOGETHER WERE SUGGESTING THAT YOU DROP THIS PROPOSAL THIS AFTERNOON SO THAT WE CAN GET UP OUR SLEEVES AND PRO AND FOCUS ON WHAT YOU'RE. WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITY THIS COMMITTEE IS STATED TO BE PREVENTION? ACCOUNTABILITY AND SICK AND SECURITY -- FOR OUR IOUS SO YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF. FIRST OF ALL WHAT CAUSES FIRES AND WHO CAUSE FIRES WE HAD A RECENT REPORT JUST CAME OUT TWO HOURS AGO. P. GENIE FROM 200-014-22000. SEVENTEEN BECAUSE THEIR EQUIPMENT BECAUSE FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE DIFFERENT FIRES. EIGHTEEN OF THOSE WERE THE FIRES WHICH CAL FIRES RULED ON THAT WE KNOW ABOUT. THOSE OTHER FIRES MANY TIMES OUR INDIVIDUAL HOMES. THOSE HOMEOWNERS IF THEY WERE PREDOMINATELY AT FALL UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION GET REIMBURSED. TO IF YOU'D TAKE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL YOU'RE NOT JUST CHANGING. CITIES AND COUNTIES YOU'RE CHANGING INDIVIDUAL INVERSE CONDEMNATION. WILL THE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES. WILL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IT FITS YOUR DISTRICT IT ENDS UP HAVING AN IOUS BECAUSE FIRE. REIMBURSED THAT HOMEOWNER. WHO IS A MIDDLE CLASS PERSON OR IS UNDER INSURED? AND IS BY THE WE FOUND OUT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNDER ENSURE. WILL THAT HOMEOWNER BE ABLE TO REIMBURSE THAT ECONOMIC DAMAGE THAT THAT I OWE YOU BECAUSE IN IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO BUILD OR REBUILD. WE WOULD ANSWER NO THEY CAN'T. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AS IF IT WERE ANOTHER CITY. WHEN THEY HAD A BENZENE LEAK AS SANTA ROSA DID WHERE IT DAMAGE THE PIPES AND CREATED BEEN SEEN? IN ASSEMBLY ONE WOODS DISTRICT. IT COSTS A I BELIEVE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO REPAIR. WITH THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA FOR ALL ITS COSTS AND STUFF PEOPLE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR WAY OVER AND ABOVE WHAT THEY STEPPED UP TO BECAUSE NO IT MAY NOT. WILL THE RECENT FIRES -- THERE WERE CAUSED BY UTILITIES. HELP THE CREDIT MARKETS. WHICH YOU'RE MANY OF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WILL HELP THAT THE STABILITY. A PARTICULAR EPG NAY. IF WE FIND OUT THAT THEY'RE THE CAUSE OF THE TUB FIRE. THE ANSWER IS MR FISKE SAID. IT'S PROBABLY NOT. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO DEAL WITH PREVENTION. THESE SMART LAWYERS GONNA FILED NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS. AND THOSE NEGLIGENT CLAIMS ARE GONNA BE PROBABLY CONVICTED AS MR FISKE HAS TALKED ABOUT AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PASS THAT THROUGH. OR GET YOU TO SECURITIZED DEBT THAT [inaudible] WILL. IT DOESN'T PASS A CONSTITUTIONAL TEST. YOUR OWN LEAD COUNSEL OUR COUNCIL SAYS NO. COULD IT REYES INSURANCE RATES OR DRIVE. INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF CALIFORNIA. BOB WE'VE IN MY AREA AND FOUNTAIN GROUP I KNOW MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE RE ENTERED AS THEY LOOK TO BUYING A NEW HOUSE ALREADY SO. AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS IF WE CONTINUE TO SPEND. ALL OUR TIME ON INVERSE CONDEMNATION WHICH IS THE EIGHT HUNDRED POUND GORILLA. AND A DISTRACTION YOU ONLY HAVE SEVENTEEN DAYS LUCK. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PREVENTION. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MISTER. DOLLIES PROPOSALS AROUND FOR SPENDING OR HOW TO GET ROAD ACCESS INTO FORESTS OR ALL THE REST OF THINGS. BUT PLEASE MISS JACKSON'S DISTRICT OUT AS WE KNOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. WERE BATTLING OVER THAT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. WE KNOW WHAT CAUSES FIRES WE KNOW THAT SAN DIEGO ELECTRIC WAS GOOD WE KNOW THAT THERE'S FIFTEEN HUNDRED FORTY ONE OTHER FIRES CAUSED BY P. GENIE AND THAT THEY WERE NEGLIGENT AND ELEVEN LET'S GET. FIRE MARSHALS ORDER CAL FIRE YOUR DECISION TO DO TO BILL MAHER THOSE LINES IF THEY FOLLOW THE STANDARDS. THEN WE WON'T HAVE THESE FIRES. IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE FIRES THEN THEY WILL BE STABLE WITHIN IT -- SO WE DO SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU PULLED INSURANCE SECURITIZATION PREVENTION AND ALL THOSE THINGS AND FOR ME. AND THE CONSTITUENTS I REPRESENT AS YOU ALL KNOW I AND MY WIFE WOKE UP AT FOUR IN THE MORNING ON OCTOBER THE NINTH. TO HELP OUR HOUSE ON FIRE RAN FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES THROUGH FLAMES BURNING UNDER FOOT FLAMES. AND ALMOST DIED IF NOT FOR NOT TO THE FIREMAN SO I AM DOING THIS SO THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO US LAST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER. WHAT HAPPENED IN JANUARY NOT ACETO OR IN DECEMBER IN THE TORAH COUNTY? DOESN'T HAPPEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'D LIKE TO TO WORK ON AND HELP YOU WITH. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. IF YOU ARE WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION THE PERSONAL ASPECT THAT YOU BRING TO IT. AND THEN ALL OF YOU HAVE CERTAINLY GIVEN US -- ADDITIONAL INSIGHT THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL I I WANTED TO IF I COULD. AND I'LL TURN TO OTHERS ON THE COMMITTEE. FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BUT I IN THE AS THE GOVERNOR'S REPRESENTED WAS MAKING HIS PRESENTATION ON OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THERE WAS A A LOT OF QUESTIONS AROUND FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S AND HOW. THAT WAS THROUGH THE MODEL. OF TO ESTABLISH WITHIN THAT PROPOSAL I'D LIKE TO GET INTO MANY MISTRESS HERE THE PERSON TO RESPOND. AND OTHERS CAN AS WELL OF AND I THINK IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU ALLUDED TO IT TO SOME DEGREE -- BUT IF YOU COULD KIND OF GO BACK OVER INSERTED DESCRIBED. WHERE CAN I KNOW SENATOR JACKSON'S MADE SOME COMMENTS TO THE? EFFECT BUT I'D BE INTERESTED IN JUST HEARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE. ON OF THE MODELS FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S AND HOW. THEY COULD BE USED OR IN THIS. THEY ARE NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE. A WAY TO MAKE THIS A COMPARISON. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND I FIRST WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THERE WERE A LOT OF MISSTATEMENTS ABOUT THE LAW I'VE READ BELLAIRE OF RED LAUGHLIN. READ THE PROGENY OF CASES THAT COME FROM THAT -- I THINK THERE IS A LACK OF FOUNDATION IN THE LEGAL ANALYSIS FROM MICHAEL LARA -- MISTER PICKERING MISTER RALPH INSIDE I'M GONNA CLARIFY THAT NOW. THE FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT CASES IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT USING INVERSE CONDEMNATION IT'S STILL INVERSE CONDEMNATION IT'S STILL A PROPERTY OWNERS RIGHT TO ENFORCE ITS EMINENT DOMAIN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. WHAT THE COURTS DID IN THOSE CASES IS TAKE A LOOK AT A SITUATION A GEOGRAPHICAL? TOPOGRAPHICAL SITUATION WHERE FLOODS ALREADY EXIST IT'S A RISK THAT WAS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE AND A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY HAS SAID WE'RE GOING TO GO NGUYEN pRISK. THE RISK IS ALREADY CREATED BY NATURE AND A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY IS TAKING ON THE ROLE OF THE RISK PREVENTER. IN THAT SITUATION THE COURTS WERE LOOKING AT A BALANCING OF FACTORS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING ON THE CONTROL OR THE PREVENTION OF OF NATURE. IT IS SUCH A NARROW EXCEPTION. THAT BEAT FLOOD THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE INJURY OF THE LAWSUIT. HAS TO BE THE VERY FLOOD THAT WAS TRYING TO BE PREVENTED. SO EVEN IN -- IN ANY OTHER TYPE OF SITUATION AND IN FACTI'VE GIVEN YOU A HAND OUT OF ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT DIFFERENT CASES IN WHICH THE LAUGHLIN FACTORS WERE REJECTED. BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A NARROW EXCEPTION IT IS STILL INVERSE CONDEMNATION BUT IT ONLY APPLIES WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUT ON THIS HALF OF SAID HEY WE'RE GOING TO GO AND TRY TO PREVENT A RISK THAT ALREADY EXISTS. P. GENIE IS NOT A FIRE PREVENTION DISTRICT. THEY ARE CREATING A RISK WHEN THEY DESIGN AND USE THEIR SYSTEM AS INTENDED. THAT IS JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER ALL 99% OF OTHER INVERSE CONDEMNATION CASES IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CREATING A RISK OR HEAR THE GOVERNMENT HAS GRANTED POWERS. TO BE I OWE YOU WHICH NOW HAS BROAD EMINENT DOMAIN POWERS. TO PUT POLLS AND LINES AND DESIGN THEIR SYSTEM QUITE FRANKLY IN. AND AWAY THAT GIVES THEM AN ENORMOUS POWER TO DO SO. THEY'VE CREATED THAT RISK AND THAT'S WHY DID TRADITIONAL STANDARD WHICH IS INTENDED USE AND DESIGN APPLIES TO ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS. IF I IF I MAY FAT IN THE IN THE pSENATOR JACKSON'S ASKING ABOUT THEY SPEND EIGHT PARAGRAPHS ANALYZING JUST THIS ISSUE. IT WAS THE EXPLICIT ARGUMENT BY EDISON IN THAT CASE. TO HAVE THE LACHLAN FACTORS APPLY TO THEM. THE COURT TOOK EIGHT PARAGRAPHS TALKING ABOUT WHY THERE IS NO COMPARISON AT ALL. AND IN FACT. IF IF IN THAT CASE EDISON GOT WHAT IT WANTED WHERE DOES THAT END. HOW MANY OTHER WAYS WOULD BE PEOPLE OR GOVERNMENTS BE SIR SEEKING TO ESCAPE LIABILITY? AND FOR THAT REASON THE COURT ROUND THE OBJECT A REJECTED THE USE OF LACHLAN FACTORS IN THESE UTILITY CASES. AND IF I COULD AND THEN I'LL JUST I'LL TURN TO SENATOR HUESO BUT I GUESS I'M I'M. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR ABOUT HOW YOU DESCRIBED. OF THIS POTENTIAL RISK THAT UTILITIES CREATED THE RISK I THINK IS WHAT YOU DESCRIBE BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE PUTTING. BUILDING POLLS AND LONGTIME GOOD RUNNING. THROUGH WOODED AREAS RIGHT -- HOW DO YOU? AT THE END OF THE DAY HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH TO HIS PROVIDE UTILITY POWER. THROUGHOUT.THE SPADE AND IT HAS TO RUN THROUGH AREAS. THAT ARE IN THIS CASE WOODED AND NOT ALL BUT AND THEN KAMOSE WHERE THEY HAVE TO RUN THROUGH AREAS WHERE THERE COULD BE POTENTIAL. FIRE RISK BUT IT FOR THE BENEFIT. OF EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM AND EVERYONE OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM. SO THAT WHEN THEY HIT THE SWITCH THE LIGHTS COME ON SO I I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE THESE. GREAT QUESTION IF IT BRING OUR YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE. AFTER A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES -- INVERSE CONDEMNATION WAS APPLIED AGAINST SD JEANNIE. IT REQUIRED SDG NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION ON INFERS. DOES OUR SYSTEM IS OUR SYSTEM INTENDED AND DESIGNED AND USED IN A WAY THAT REDUCES OR ELIMINATES THAT RISK. AS THE GENIE SAID TO THEMSELVES WE DO NOT WANT HAVE TO PAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND BURN DOWN HOMES EVER AGAIN. THEY ASK THEMSELVES THAT QUESTION THAT'S WHY INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS SO IMPORTANT IT REQUIRES THE UTILITIES TO ASK THEMSELVES THAT QUESTION. TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE. THE RISK THEY SPEND ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. AND JUST RECENTLY IN THE LILACS FIRE IS ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM MY HOUSE I WAS WAITING FOR US TO DO YOU NEED TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY'RE TURNING OFF POWER. THEY TURNED OFF POWER. FOR EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS FOR ABOUT EIGHT TO TWELVE HOURS. AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED AT THE THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS TO POWER DOWN AND HIGH WHEN POLICIES SO THE LAW ASKS P. GENIE. TO LOOK AT THE WAY THEY DESIGN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT KIND OF POLLS ARE USING WHAT KIND OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES DO WE HAVE WHAT KIND OF RE CLOSER POLICIES DO WE HAVE WHAT KIND OF A POWER DOWN IN HIGH WIND SITUATIONS DO WE HAVE. WHEN WE'RE INTENDING AND USING OUR SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT ELIMINATES RISK THAT'S HOW WE RECONCILE DELIVERING POWER TO FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE? AND STILL ARE REDUCING THE RISK. SO YOU IMPLEMENT A PGA ANY STRATEGY THAT DEFINES IN YOUR MIND A PRUDENT MANAGER. I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT THE STANDARDS THAT P. JEANNIE. HAVE IMPLEMENTED DOES THAT. ESTABLISHING YOUR MIND APPROVING MANAGER THAT P. SORRY I'M SAFE EUGENIE ES DE JEANNIE THE ACRONYMS ARE KILLING ME FOR SDG ANY -- I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE POLICIES AND THIS IS ACTUALLY PART OF A DISCOVERY PROCESS IN LITIGATION ROUND THE CONGRESS'S RIGHT BUT I DO BELIEVE THE SD GENIE HAS SET A STANDARD THAT IS SO FAR AND ABOVE WHAT P. GENIE HAS DONE. THAT P. GINNY REGARDLESS OF WHAT AS TO JEANNIE HAS DONE NEEDS TO CATCH UP OKAY -- I THINK SOONER HUESO -- AND THE SOONER CHAD MAYES NOT I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE DISTINCTIONS AS TO WHY -- FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICTS WERE STYLISH TO BEGIN. SO WHY DID WE EVEN NEED A FOUGHT FOR FLOOD CONTROL CRUISE CONTROL DISTRICT WITH A SPECIFIC WHICH YOU MENTIONED A BALANCING FACTOR LIABILITY IN THE CASES OF PROPERTY OWNERS AND FLOODING. WELL ORIGINALLY FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S CAME BEFORE -- THE BALANCING LAWS IN THE OLD WESTERN DAYS PEOPLE WERE WALKING AROUND IN MUDDY DIRTY WATER AND WE REALIZED IN ORDER TO BUILD GOOD SOCIETIES IN ORDER TO ALLOW. OUT ROADS TO BE USED IN ORDER FOR OUR HOMES TO BE BUILDING COMMUNITIES TO BE BUILT WE NEEDED TO WORK AGAINST NATURE. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO MITIGATE THAT RISK IN THE MITIGATION OF THAT RISK THE LAW RECOGNIZES THAT THE RISK ALREADY EXISTS AS A FUNCTION OF NATURE GEOGRAPHY TOPOGRAPHY AND AND SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP LAND YOU NEEDED TO CREATE A FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. TO AT LEAST ALLOW THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE MADE. SO IT IT IT TRIGGERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND -- NO I THINK IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND I THINK FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICTS WERE DOING THE JOB THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO. IN MITIGATING A RISK. THEY DIDN'T DOES SIGN FOR EXAMPLE THE FLOOD. THEY DIDN'T DESIGN THE WAY THAT THE MOUNTAINS AND THE RAIN WATER FLOODS INTO A CERTAIN BASIN. HERE ESTEEM GENIE P. GENIE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON ARE STARTING FROM SCRATCH. THEY'RE PUTTING IN THE POLL THEY'RE PUTTING IN THE RISK WITH FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT THE RISK IS CREATED BUT NO NO I'M I'M UPON WHICH I ONLY HAVE LIMITED TIME. GET TO MY POINT. AND I JUST WANNA I JUST WANT ESTABLISH WHAT THAT. THAT FULCRUM IS A DECIDES WHERE WHERE THE LAWS APPLIED SO. IN THE CASE OF OF OF FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT IT WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ULTIMATELY IT'S THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND WITHOUT A FULL PHILIP CONTROL DISTRICT. HE CAN'T THE FLOODS COME AND WE UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT GONNA CONTROL NATURE. YOU KNOW SO THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN MITIGATE IMPACTS OF A NO SIR THAT'S NOT THE POLICY REASONING BEHIND THE FLOOD CONTROL CASES THE POLICY REASON BEHIND THE FLOOD CONTROL CASES IS THAT NATURE HAS CREATED THE RISK. AND HERE I OKAY EN IS CREATING THE RISK WITH INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S A FULCRUM WELL. IT AND THAT MAY BE SO. THE QUESTION IS [inaudible] TODAY. IS A AND YOU'RE ARGUING THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT -- CLIMATE CHANGE THIS BECAUSE IN THE RISK. NO EIGHT WHAT'S CAUSING THE RISK BECAUSE IN ORIGIN. AND THERE ARE AND THERE ARE ENORMOUS TEAMS OF LAWYERS ON BOTH SIDES OF AYE USING PLAINTIFFS. THAT HAVE VERY EXPERIENCED FIRE INVESTIGATORS. CAL FIRE DETERMINES THE ACTUAL CAUSE AND ORIGIN OF THE FIRE THE SPARK STARTS SOMEWHERE. AND THAT SOMEWHERE COMES FROM THE INTENDED USE AND DESIGN THE WEEPY GENIE HAS DESIGNED ITS INFRASTRUCTURE CAUSES THE SPARK. CLIMATE CHANGE MAY EXACERBATE THE SITUATION WHICH IS ALL THE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED INVERSE CONDEMNATION TO REDUCE THAT RISK SNIPPY JEANNIE ASKS ITSELF. DOES OUR SYSTEM IS OUR SYSTEM DESIGNED IN USED IN A WAY THAT REDUCES THAT RISK IN LIGHT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE BUT DON'T YOU THINK WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE DON'T YOU THINK CLIMATE CHANGE HAS TRIGGERED -- ENORMOUS MODIFIERS AND A DROUGHT THAT HAS DECIMATED A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION TREES THAT HAS CREATED MORE FUEL THAN THE STATE OR ANYONE INCLUDING UTILITY OR PROPERTY OWNER CAN MANAGE I THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY AT THIS HEARING BECAUSE THE P. GENIUS ASKING FOR SOME SORT OF BAIL OUT. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TODAY FOR THIS HEARING I DON'T THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF OVERALL CLIMATE CHANGE I THINK THERE ARE OTHER HEARINGS THAT MAY ADDRESS THAT. ONLY ONE BUT THE WELL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DEVIATE IN OTHER WORDS I ASKED A QUESTION. THE QUESTION WAS IS CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE INNOCENT CAN WE KNOW CERCAN CONT CLIMATE CHANGE DOES NOTCAUSE AND START WILDFIRES. DOES DOES THAT DOES DOES A CONSTRUCT DROUGHT THAT CAUSES PLAGUE THAT CAUSES THE DEATH OF A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION TREES CERTAIN KNOW WHAT CAUSES WILDFIRES IN YOU CAN ASK CAL FIRE. IN SIXTEEN OF CASES THEY FOUND THAT P. GINNY BECAUSE SIXTEEN OF THOSE FIRES IN ELEVEN OF THOSE SIXTEEN PGD FAILED TO FOLLOW CURRENT STATE STANDARDS. P. JEANNIE AND ITS EQUIPMENT HAS BECAUSE I AGREE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE. I AGREE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MAY EXACERBATE THE SITUATION IT'S ALL THE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED TO BE PROTECTIVE OF HOMEOWNERS AND ASK THESE COMPANIES TO ASK THEMSELVES. IS OUR SYSTEM DESIGNED AND USED IN A WAY THAT REDUCES THAT RISK. AND I I JUST WANTED TO ESTABLISH THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FLOOD CONTROL. AND AND UTILITY DISTRICTS AS IT AS IT RENDERS PROPERTY PROPERTY USEFUL IN DEVELOPABLE. AND AND THE BALANCING FACTOR IN BOTH INSTANCES FROM MY FROM MY POSITION IS NATURE. NATURE IS CHANGING WHICH REQUIRES A RESPONSE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW I DON'T. I'M NOT. FOR A BAILOUT AND I DON'T NECESSARILY. LOOKING FOR IN THIS COMMITTEE ANYTHING THAT THAT. TRANSLATES INTO A BAILOUT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MALE AT ITS. AND THIS IN THIS ISSUE ARE NECESSARY. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD RUSH TO DECISION THAT EITHER CONTRIBUTES TO A A BAILOUT QUARRY OR IN ANY WAY GIVES PROPERTY OWNERS -- TO COURT DO RECOURSE TO TO OUR RECOVER THEIR REMEDIES AND I THINK THAT THE DECISION THAT WE'VE SEEN FIVE LEGAL COUNSEL. SHOWS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO EVEN -- AFFECT. INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND IF WE TRIED AYE I DON'T THINK WOULD PREVAIL BUT NONE THE LESS I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT I MEAN THE RELATED. AND THAT'S THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE SHOULD JUST UP. A IF IF WE DO WE DO ANYTHING IT SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WHO THE FOR THE THAT THE THE THE RELATED ISSUE. PERCENT THAT. BOAT. RACE. ON THE SURFACE GOV -- I'VE ENJOYED OUR ROBUST ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD US SEVERAL OF THEM NOW AS RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY ON WHICH WAS A LOT OF FUN AND I FOUND. I'M YOU ARE TO BE SOMEBODY WHO WILL -- IN REGARDS THE DOCTRINE OF THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION -- SOME HIS WILL READ STUDIED ON AND AND UNDERSTANDS IT NOW WHICH IS ALWAYS VERY NICE WHEN THERE'S AN ATTORNEY THAT ACTUALLY GETS THIS -- NO OFFENSE TO THE ATTORNEYS IN THE ROOM -- SO I pIN REGARDS -- TO INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND THE AND THE LIABILITY I'M QUESTION. ARE THERE ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND THE PUBLIC PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES AND IF THERE ARE WHAT ARE THEY OKAY GREAT QUESTION. AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK IS THE HEART OF THESE ISSUES -- IN TERMS OF THE STANDARDS THEMSELVES THE LIABILITY STANDARDS IN COURT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE. WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE? HAS DECIDED THAT IS GOING TO TAKE ITS. INHERENT EMINENT DOMAIN POWERS. AND GIFT SOME OF THOSE WHO LOST COOLEY TEACH A BUNDLE OF STICKS ARE GONNA GIFT YOU A BUNDLE OF STICKS TO DEMO USER PO USE. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HELD BACK THE POWER TO PASS THROUGH OR SOCIALIZE ON TO REPAIRS. AND THAT IS WHERE MUCH OF THE CONSTERNATION WITH I USE EXISTS IS THAT THIS CITY CALIFORNIA GIFTED THEM THE ABILITY TO HAVE EMINENT DOMAIN POWER AND BUILD THESE MASSIVE ELECTRICAL GRIDS. BUT THEY HELD BACK IN THE CPUC VIS OUR AUTHORITY -- TO TO PASS ON TO RATEPAYERS OR TO DO SOMETHING LIKE SECURITIZATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PO USING I'LL USE ON A MIXTURE A CLEAR BUT IN REGARDS TO LIABILITIES THERE ISN'T ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PEEL USE AND THE I'LL USE NOT THAT I'M AWARE. OF IT THANK YOU. AND SOME WOMEN HOLDEN JUST VERY QUICKLY WE WROTE BUT LET ME JUST BECAUSE DO YOU HAVE THE FLOOR CONCERT [inaudible] I THOUGHT. YEAH I JUST GOT A QUICK QUESTION BEFORE WE WRAP UP THIS THIS GUY KEPT SPECIFIC PANEL. I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO NOTE FOR THE AUDIENCE IN FAVOR MEMBERS HERE. THE P. GENIE WAS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE PANELS TODAY BECAUSE I THINK FROM MY VANTAGE POINT I FELT LIKE THEY DID HAVE AN AX TO GRIND AND IN THIS SPECIFIC TOPIC THOUGH. JEANNIE'S -- OUTSIDE COUNSEL WILL BE UP I THINK ON THE NEXT PANEL IF NOT THE NEXT ONE THE ONE AFTER THAT AND FOR SOMEBODY THAT HAS BEEN I THINK A GOOD ACTORS THEY'RE EQUALLY AS ANXIOUS TO HAVE -- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD ABOUT OPINING ON WHERE THAT'S RIGHT WRONG OR INDIFFERENT I JUST WANTED TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT [inaudible] IT. OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. OKAY PANEL NUMBER TO PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] SURE. SO WE HAVE HENRY WISEMAN ATTORNEY ALOFT FOR ITS OUTSIDE COUNSELFOR THE OUTSIDE SO THE CALIFORNIA SEN ARLEN ORCHARD TO MANAGE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO OF SACRAMENTO. I MEAN DISABILITIES IN MUNICIPAL UTILITIES DISTRICT MARK JOSEPH ATTORNEY FOR THE COALITION A CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN JAN* ME -- JONES PRESIDENT OF THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS. SO I THINK I MISTER WEITZMAN EUROPE FIRST. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M HENRY WEISSMAN I'M HERE REPRESENTING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WANTED TO START BY SAYING. HOW MOVED I WAS BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES AND CERTAINLY? MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE VICTIMS IN THE FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THAT TERRIBLE INCIDENT. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN STANDARD FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES THAT ADDRESSES THE STANDARD GOING FORWARD. A BIG PART. LIKE IF THE I UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH LET HIM FINISH LET HIM FINISH HIS TESTIMONY PLEASE SENATOR. AND AYE I WAS HOPING TO MAKE THREE POINTS THIS AFTERNOON. FIRST TO TALK ABOUT WHY A CHANGE TO THE STANDARD FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION GOING FORWARD IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE -- UNDER THE STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE UTILITY IS LIABLE FOR ALL PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM A WILDFIRE IGNITED BY ITS FACILITIES. EVEN IF THE UTILITY WAS WITHOUT FAULT. AND FOLLOWED ALL OF THE RULES. AND EVEN IF THE SPREAD OF THE FIRE WAS DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES. SUCH AS WIND AND WEATHER THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE UTILITIES CONTROL IN EFFECT. THIS MAKES UTILITIES THE INSURERS OF LAST RESORT. THE RESULTING COSTS TO THE UTILITIES CAN BE ENORMOUS AND CONSEQUENCES EXTREMELY NEGATIVE. NOT JUST FOR THE UTILITIES. BUT ALSO FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS AND FOR THE STATE HOUSEHOLD. A STANDARD THAT IMPOSES LIABILITY BASED ON WHETHER THE UTILITY ACTED REASONABLY. WOULD BE FAIR FOR CUSTOMERS AN ALLIANCE LIABILITY WITH FAULT. SECOND I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO ADOPT A REASONABLENESS STANDARD. FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION CASES ARISING FROM WILDFIRES AT FIRST I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE DISTINCTION. BETWEEN THE ELIMINATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION WHICH THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT TO ON THE CONSTITUTION. VERSUS THE ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD THAT WOULD BE APPLIED TO DETERMINE WHEN INVERSE LIABILITY EXISTS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DEFINITELY DOES HAVE A ROLAND. AS PROFESSOR WARRANT TESTIFIED LAST WEEK. THE CALIFORNIA RICK SUPREME COURT HAS REPEATEDLY SAID. THAT THE COURTS MUST GIVE GREAT WEIGHT. TO THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION UNLESS THAT INTERPRETATION. IS CLEARLY CONTRARY TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE CONSTITUTION ANOTHER WORDS WHEN THE CONSTITUTION IS AMBIGUOUS. AND CAN BE INTERPRETED IN VARIOUS WAYS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE PREROGATIVE TO SELECT AN INTERPRETATION AND THE COURTS WILL GIVE GREAT WEIGHT TO THAT CHOICE AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE. WHEN THAT INTERPRETATION IS BASED ON POLICY CONSIDERATIONS WITH THE LAW WHICH THE LEGISLATURE IS BETTER POSITION THAN THE COURTS TO MAKE? THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION ON CONVERSE CON CONDEMNATION. IS AMBIGUOUS ON THE STANDARD OF LIABILITY. THE LANGUAGE SILENCE ON THAT QUESTION THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. HAS SUPPLIED THREE DIFFERENT STANDARDS OVER TIME. ORIGINALLY THE STANDARD WAS THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD BE LIABLE IN INVERSE CONDEMNATION ONLY ONE A PRIVATE PARTY COULD BE LIABLE IN OTHER WORDS ONLY IF THERE WAS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL CONDUCT. THEN THE COURT ADOPTED A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD. AND LATER STILL THE COURT% ADOPTED A REASONABLENESS STANDARD IN THE FLOOD CONTROL CASES. OR I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZETHAT THERE'S TWO SEPARATE QUESTIONS HERE ONE IS DOES THE LEGISLATURE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT AN INTERPRETATION THAT IS. IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE CONSTITUTION BROAD ENOUGH TO PERMIT THE ADOPTION OF A REASONABLENESS STANDARD. CLEARLY THE ANSWER IS YES SUITS ARE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OVER TIME BY THE CALIFORNIA COURTS. AS WELL AS INTERPRETATIONS BY OTHER STATES A SECOND QUESTION IS SHOULD. WE LEGISLATOR ADOPT A REASONABLENESS STANDARD AND HERE I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE BALANCE OF INTERESTS THAT WAS UNDERLYING THE FLOOD CONTROL CASES IS CERTAINLY RELEVANT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY. THAT IS THE POLICY QUESTION THAT THIS BODY THE LEGISLATURE IS CALLED UPON TO MAKE AND WHEN THE COURTS MADE THESE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT STANDARD SHOULD BE APPLIED. THEY WERE DOING SO BASED ON POLICY CONSIDERATIONS BUT WITHOUT GUIDANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE. IT IS THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE UNDER OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM TO MAKE POLICY JUDGMENTS. AND THE COURTS ARE VERY INCLINED TO DEFER TO THOSE DETERMINATIONS. A REASONABLENESS STANDARD FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION CASES INVOLVING WILDFIRES. ALLIANCE WITH THE INTERPRETATION THAT THE COURT ADOPTED IN THOSE FLOOD CONTROL CASES AND IS SUPPORTED BY SIMILAR POLICY RATIONALES. WILDFIRE RISKS REQUIRE A BALANCING OF THE BENEFITS OF EXTENDING ELECTRIC SERVICE TO ALL AREAS OF THE STATE. AGAINST THE RISKS THAT THOSE FACILITIES MIDNIGHT A FIRE AT FINALLY I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THESE THE SHIFT FROM A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD TO A REASONABLENESS STANDARD. WOULD NOT RESULT IN ADVERSE INCENTIVES TO MAINTAIN THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM UTILITIES. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COULD STILL BE HELD LIABLE IF THEY ACTED NEGLIGENTLY. COULD BE HELD LIABLE IF THEY ACTED UNREASONABLY. AND IS COULD STILL BE PENALIZED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IF THEY VIOLATE THE RULES SO THE UTILITIES WILL STILL HAVE THE INCENTIVE. AND INDEED WILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION OF THE COMMISSION WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT THAT WAS DISCUSSED ON TUESDAY THANK YOU TORTURE. I THINK I'M SECOND PART WELL BORROWING ORCHARD. LETS I SAID WELL I'M SORRY FOR GOOD. COLLEGE EYES GERMAN DODD CHAIRMAN HOLDEN A MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE M. ARLEN ORCHARD AND I'M THE CEO IN GENERAL MANAGER SMUD WHERE THE NATION'S SIX LARGEST COMMUNITY OWNED ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDER SECOND LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA. WE SERVE THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION RESIDENTS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND SMALL -- JOINING PORTIONS OF YELLOW. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. WE APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS -- CRITICAL MATTER WHAT SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS DESIGNATED AS LOW RISK FOR FIRE ARE SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MEGAWATT HYDROELECTRIC. PROJECT IN EL DORADO COUNTY IS LOCATED ON FEDERAL LAND INCLUDES FIFTY EIGHT MILES OF TRANSMISSION LINES AS AND IS IN A DESIGNATED HIGH FIRE RISK AREA. SMITH IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES AND I WON'T REPORT THE LONG LIST OF MEASURES WE ARE TAKING -- BUT THEY'RE LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE COMMITTEE HEARD FROM THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES -- AT TUESDAY'S HEARING WE HAD FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. THE KING FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN CAME VERY CLOSE TO OUR HYDROELECTRIC FACILITIES OVER TWENTY FOUR DAYS IT BURNED MORE THAN NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES. WE SHARE A TRANSMISSION LINE RIGHT OF WAY WITH PGDM PRIOR TO THE CAMPFIRE WE WORKED WITH PROPERTY OWNERS TO EXPAND VEGETATION CLEARANCES. OUTSIDE OF OUR RIGHT OF WAY IT WAS NOT EASY I WILL TELL YOU TO GET AGREEMENT FROM THE PROPERTY OWNERS BUT CAL FIRE INDICATED THAT THIS EXPANDED FIREBREAK WAS THE SINGLE FACTOR THAT HELD THE FIRE BACK. FROM THE APPLE HILL ORCHARDS AND ECONOMIC CENTRE EAST TO PLACERVILLE WITH MORE THAN THIRTY ORCHARDS WINERIES BREWERIES AND CHRISTMAS TREE FARMS. AS WE COME TO GRIPS WITH OUR CHANGING CLIMATE INCLUDING DROUGHT AND I'M PRESIDENT WILDFIRES WE MUST ALL DO MORE WORK TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. AS SUCH WE ENCOURAGE THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT MORE ROBUST FIRE IN FORCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. SUMMIT SUPPORTS A SOLUTION THAT REQUIRES A UTILITIES TO DO MORE TO ADOPT MORE EXPANSIVE WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLANTS AND STRENGTH CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF ELECTRICAL LINES AND EQUIPMENT. SMART ENOUGH OTHER UTILITY SHOULD REMAIN LIABLE FOR WHILE FAR COSTS WHEN WERE FAULT THAT'S ONLY FAIR. HARBOR UTILITIES SHOULD NOT BE HELD STRICTLY LIABLE FOR WILD FOR DAMAGES WHEN UTILITY ACTED REASONABLY AND RESPONSIBLY AND MET ALL APPLICABLES STANDARDS FOR EXAMPLE UNDER EXISTING LAW. FIRE CAUSED BY A TREE LIMB FROM OUTSIDE OUR RIGHT OF WAY BLOWING INTO A POWER LINE. EVEN IF WE'D MET ALL SAFETY. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN TRINITY COUNTY WITH THE AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN ELENA FIRE. ACCORDING TO THE US FOREST SERVICE THE WHOLE IN A FIRE WHICH BURNED MORE THAN TWICE -- NEARLY TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ACRES AND DESTROYED TWENTY TWO RESIDENCES WAS CAUSED BY A BRANCH FROM A TREE WELL OUTSIDE THE UTILITY EASEMENT FALLING ON A TRINITY PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT LINE. IF TRENDY IS LINE IS FOUNDED THE IGNITION SOURCE STRICT LIABILITY WILL APPLY AND TRINITY'S CUSTOMERS MANY OF WHOM ARE LOW WHO ARE LOW INCOME WILL BEAR THAT FULL FINANCIAL BURDEN. WELL WE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE PERSONAL DEVASTATION INFLICTED ON EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF A COMMUNITY IMPACTED BY WILDFIRE. WE MUST ALSO BE MINDFUL OF THE INEQUITIES THAT RESULT FROM SHIFTING THESE COST UTILITIES REGARDLESS OF FAULT. UNLIKE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES LIKES MUD DON'T HAVE SHAREHOLDERS TO BEAR THE COST OF THE DAMAGES INFLICTED BY THE CATASTROPHIC FIRE. ARE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO COLLECT FROM OUR CUSTOMERS WITH THOSE COSTS HAVING A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON THOSE LEAST LIKELY TO AFFORD IT INCLUDING LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. THE ELDERLY AND RENTERS IN MAJOR WILDFIRE LIKE RECENT FIRES ELSEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA COULD CAUSE* ELECTRIC RATES TO JUMP BY 25%. ESPECIALLY SMALL PO USE COULD BE DRIVEN INTO BANKRUPTCY. WHAT SMOG RETAINS WILDFIRE INSURANCE TO PROTECT AGAINST THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE CATASTROPHIC FIRE STRICT LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HAS CAUSED WHILE FOR INSURANCE RATES TO SKYROCKET? ARE WILD FOR INSURANCE COSTS FOR THE COMING YEAR ARE FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN A YEAR AGO. OUR ENVIRONMENT WILL ALSO SUFFER IF THE COST OF WHILE FOR DAMAGES ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH NEGLIGENCE IN UTILITIES CONTINUE TO BE HELD STRICTLY LIABLE. HIGHER INSURANCE COSTS IN PAIN CLAIMS WHEN NOT AT FAULT WILL DIVERT UTILITY INVESTMENTS AWAY FROM OUR AGGRESSIVE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND GHG REDUCTION GOALS. NOW MORE THAN EVER AS WILDFIRES RECAP BACK ON OUR ENVIRONMENT WE MUST DEPEND ON A RELIABLE ELECTRIC SYSTEM TO MEET OUR CLEAN AIR GOALS. WE MUST ACT SWIFTLY AND THOUGHTFULLY TO ADDRESS THIS URGENT MATTER WE MUST HOLD NEGLIGENT PARTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES AND ENCOURAGE INCREASED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLANNING ACTIVITIES. BUT WE MUST ALSO REFORM STRICT LIABILITY STANDARDS FOR UTILITIES THAT IT ACT REASONABLY RESPONSIBLY TO PROTECT OUR CUSTOMERS COMMUNITY CENTER ENVIRONMENT SENATE SUPPORTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ONE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK OUT FOR DINNER QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER JOSEPH. THANK YOU TO CARE MEMBERS AND TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AGAIN. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA TOLD EMPLOYEES. I WANT TO START OFF BY FOCUSING OUT CLEARLY AND WHAT THE ISSUE IS HERE AND WHAT THE ISSUE IS NOT. WITH INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND ITS ASSOCIATES STRICT LIABILITY THE ISSUE IS. SHOULD VICTIMS OF A FUTURE WILDFIRE THAT'S CAUSED BY UTILITY EQUIPMENT WITH THE UTILITY DID NOTHING WRONG. AUTOMATICALLY GET DAMAGES FROM THE UTILITY. THE ISSUE IS NOT. IS THEIR LIABILITY WHEN THE UTILITY WAS NEGLIGENT NOBODY'S DISPUTING THAT. AND UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE ISSUE IS NOT ANYTHING ABOUT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES OR BAIL OUT OF P. GINNY. FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT'S ABOUT FUTURE FIRES WITH UTILITY DID NOTHING WRONG. AND THE QUESTION IS SHOULD THEY NEVER LESS HAVE TO PAY AUTOMATIC DAMAGES. WELL WHEN A COMPANY PAYS AUTOMATIC DAMAGES TO SOMEONE AND DID NOTHING WRONG THAT'S INSURANCE. SHOULD THE UTILITY BE THE INSURER HERE OR SHOULD INSURANCE COMPANIES BE THE INSURERS. OF COURSE THE VICTIMS NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE THE QUESTION IS BY WHOM. NOW IT WOULD CLEARLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH UNDERINSURED AND UNINSURED PEOPLE. BUT WEHAVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT FIRES THAT ARE GOING NOW ON NIGHT NOW. THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH UTILITIES AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM [inaudible] BUT HERE. SAYING THAT THE UTILITY SHOULD BE THE INSURER FOR SOME FUTURE FIRES IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE POLICY. THAT'S THE STATE WILL POLICY FOR THREE REASONS [inaudible] FIRST. IT'S GOING TO RESULT IN MORE FIRES NOT LESS. ON TUESDAY I TESTIFIED AND OTHER PEOPLE TESTIFIED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HARDENING THE SYSTEM ABOUT THINGS LIKE MICRO GRIDS AND STRONGER CONDUCTORS. AND STRONGER POLLS AND BETTER WEATHER FORECASTING IN A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. THEY ALL COST MONEY. IT'S WORTH IT. BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE LOTS OF UTILITY INVESTMENT. AND UTILITIES CAN'T RAISE THE MONEY TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT TO MAKE THE AT THE SYSTEM SAFER. IF THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR MONEY PAYING INSURANCE CLAIMS. IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER TO SPEND THE MONEY ON PREVENTION RATHER THAN MAKING UTILITIES THE INSURERS. LET'S HAVE THE UTILITIES MAKE THEIR SYSTEM IS BETTER AND INSURANCE COMPANIES MAKE INSURANCE BETTER. SECOND REASON UTILITIES CAN'T BE THE INSURERS. REPAIRS CAN AFFORD IT. RATEPAYERS CANNOT BE THE IT FIRE INSURERS FOR THE STATE. NOW IT'S VERY TEMPTING TO SAY THE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD PAY THE VICTIMS NOT THE RATE PAYERS. AND THAT'S THE LAW WHEN THE UTILITY WAS NOT REASONABLE AND PRUDENT. AND NO ONE IS SAYING THAT THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED. AND THE COUNTRY AND TUESDAY. I SAID THAT WE SHOULD USE THE UTILITY SAFETY PLANS AS THE STANDARD TO DETERMINE IF UTILITY WAS NEGLIGENT. BUT EVEN IF YOU THINK THAT SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD BE THE INSURER IT WILL STILL END UP COSTING THE RATEPAYERS. WE'VE HEARD IT SEVERAL TIMES TODAY ALREADY THEIR BOND STATUS IS NOW ONE STEP ABOVE JUNK BOND STATUS IT ALREADY COSTING RATEPAYERS MORE MONEY IN FINANCING COSTS. BECAUSE THE HIGHER COST OF BORROWING. IF WE DON'T FIX STRICT LIABILITY IT WILL BE EVENMORE EXPENSIVE TO RAISE THE DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING NECESSARY. AND RATEPAYERS WILL BE PAYING THOSE COSTS. SO READ THIS REALLY NO WAY AROUND IT IF THE UTILITY HAS STRICT LIABILITY. IT IS AN INSURER AND IT WILL COST RATEPAYERS. A THIRD REASON WHY UTILITIES CAN'T BE THE INSURERS. IT WILL UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA POLICIES. WE'VE GOT THE RP A SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. AND IS IT WORK BECAUSE THE UTILITIES HAVE SIGNED CONTRACTS WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPERS. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THOSE CONTRACTS YOU CAN'T DO IT IF YOU'RE ALSO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON INSURANCE AND YOU DON'T HAVE CREDIT. WE GOT ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS EVERY YEAR THE UTILITY SPENT A BILLION DOLLARS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO RAISE MONEY TO DO THAT. WE'RE NOW IN PARKING AND THE THE MOST IMPORTANT REMAINING LEG OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY THAT IS ELECTRIFYING TRANSPORTATION. UTILITIES HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED ALREADY TO SPEND ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD UP THAT CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED THERE ARE MORE APPLICATIONS PENDING. THEY CAN'T DO IT IF I HAVE TO SPEND THEIR MONEY INSURANCE. IT WOULD BE A TRAGIC OUTCOME. IF CALIFORNIA CLIMATE POLICIES BECOME A BIG VITIM OF WILDFIRES THAT ARE DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE [inaudible] FINALLY. WITH A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EXPANDING BIOMASS GENERATION. TO GET THOSE PLANTS BUILT. WE NEEDED TO LEASES SIGNED CONTRACTS TO BY THE ELECTRICITY. UTILITIES ARE NOT FINANCIALLY HEALTHY THEY CAN'T SIGN THOSE CONTRACTS IN THE CAPITAL'S PLANTS BUILT. SO DON'T BE DISTRACTED. FIXING STRICT LIABILITY IS NOT BAILING OUT THE UTILITY. IT'S SPENDING MONEY ON PREVENTION INSTEAD OF ON INSURANCE IT'S PROTECTING RATEPAYERS. AND IS PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CLIMATE POLICIES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- MISTER SMARTY JONES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I I THINK MISTER JOSEPH HIT SOME OF THE POINTS I WANTED TO MAKE I'M CHANCE BUT HE JONES WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS -- AND I REALLY DO UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THIS -- THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE HERE AND MY PURPOSES YOU KNOW MY MY ASSOCIATION US ALL OF US HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH WILDFIRES MY MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE -- NUMBER OF THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE ACTUALLY HAD THEIR HOMES BURNED IN PREVIOUS OF WELL AWARE OF AS SIGNIFICANCE OF WILDFIRES IN THEIR IMPACT ON PEOPLE -- THE PURPOSE OF MY TESTIMONY TODAY'S IS IT IS ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT SECONDARY TO WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS VOTES -- AND IT BUILDS OFF I THINK WITH MR JOSEPH JUST INDICATED A WHICH IS THE IMPACT IMPLICATIONS OF STRICT LIABILITY -- APPLICATION OF A DENVER'S COMBINATION ON OTHER POLICIES THAT -- THAT THE THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ADOPTED IN WHERE WE NEED TO GO IN THE FUTURE -- WE HAVE GENERALLY SUPPORTED THE GOVERNOR'S -- PROPOSAL HERE LARGELY BECAUSE HIS WORDS ON PAPER -- THAT IT BASICALLY GIVES US SOME FOCUS TO A DEBATE WHICH ACTUALLY IS STARTED HERE TODAY WITH RESPECT -- TO THE ISSUES AROUND -- AROUND -- WHETHER. TROW AREA IS CITY AND IT'S ALL THE SILT UP TO THE LEGISLATURE TO SORT THAT OUT AND FIGURE OUT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S HELPFUL OR NOT WITH RESPECT TO THE COURTS BEING ABLE TO REVIEW THIS IN THE FUTURE -- WE BELIEVE OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACT ACTIONS OR IN ACTIONS THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY DONE -- SO WE'RE NOT THAT BASICALLY ASKING FOR ANY SAYS TYPE OF IMMUNITY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW -- WE REPRESENT A BROAD RANGE OF THAT TECHNOLOGIES BIOMASS WIND SOLAR GEOTHERMAL -- AND AND NATURAL GAS THESE PROJECTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN BUILT BY A CALIFORNIA POLICIES -- AND ARE BASICALLY -- BUILT UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE STATE'S UTILITIES SO WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO FINANCIAL STABILITY HERE -- THE POLICIES THAT THIS GUY IS LEGISLATURE'S ADOPTED TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THEY ARE IN FACT WORKING. US ARRAY NOW THE ELECTRIC SECTOR IS 29% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS WITH RESPECT TO ITS CARBON EMISSIONS ARE OUR PS POLICIES IS 30% -- BASICALLY RETAIL SALES CURRENTLY WE'RE GOING 250% BY -- TWENTY THIRTY WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE DESIGNED AROUND -- ROOFTOP APPLICATIONS DEMAND RESPONSE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS VERY IMPORTANT -- AS INDICATED EARLIER ALL -- THE UTILITIES. THE THAT'S OCCURRING RIGHT NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE RATING AGENCIES ALL THREE HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED THIS GOES DOWN HILL ONE OF MY MEMBER COMPANIES TOPAZ SOLAR WAS DOWNGRADED BECAUSE PGD WAS DOWNGRADED -- AND ARE BASICALLY -- THERE DUH FUTURE CREDIT RATING IS IS CONTINGENT UPON WHERE PGD ENDS UP -- SO BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE HOPEFUL HERE IS A WORK F THE COULD COMMITTEE NOT ONLY ON THIS ISSUE BUT AND THE YOUR GENERAL WORK. BASICALLY HELP STABILIZE SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY THAT'S OUT THERE I WANNA BE CLEAR THAT ALL OF THESE COSTS -- THAT AS THESE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FALL -- WITH A CREDIT RATINGS FALLING. RATE PAYERS PAY MORE THEY'RE GOING TO PAY MORE FOR RENEWABLE PROJECTS TO GOING TO PAY MORE FOR THE REPLACEMENT POLLS ARE GOING TO PAY MORE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES -- ELECTRIC BILL. OKAY IS THAT -- THERE THERE IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THE RATEPAYERS ARE A PIECE OF THIS AND I THINK AS MISTER -- ORCHARD HAS INDICATED I MISS MY CUSTOMER I RECOGNIZED EFFECTIVE SMUD I HAS A FIRE IN THEIR TRANSMISSION LINE I IS A RATE PAYER OF* ARE ARE GOING TO PICK P THE PIECES THAT. ARE THE DIFFERENCES AND I THINK MR FISKE APPOINTED ON A VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE I USE HAVE THE THE P. YOU SEE STANDING BETWEEN THEM AND ABILITY AUTOMATICALLY PASSES ON SO IT IT IS WHAT IT IS THAT'S THE WORLD WE LIVE IN -- AND SO I THINK -- THE BEST THAT WE CAN DO IS TO SEE IF WE CAN -- TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME THE SHORTCOMINGS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ON AS WE ARE YPERSENSITIVE TO THE ISSUE OF BANKRUPTCY. BUT UTILITY GOES BANKRUPT AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING THAT THAT WILL NEVERHAPPEN IT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST WE'RE MINDFUL OF IT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED WITH MY MEMBER COMPANIES LARGE NUMBER OF THEM WILL GO AWAY. BANKRUPTCY -- JUDGES AND REFEREES IT IS THIS THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THAT LEGISLATURE'S PUT FORWARD THEIR JOB IS TO CREDITORS AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO AVOID THAT SO -- THE LONG TERM IMPACTS OF SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS I THINK OVERALL AND SO THE POLICY -- OBJECTIVES WE HAVE A AND HERE SO YOU KNOW IN CLOSING HERE THE REALITY IS IS THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF TALK THAT -- I MUST GET TO SENSE THAT DID THEIR PARTY SAID BELIEVE THERE'S SOME SORT OF MAGIC MONEY OUT THERE THERE ISN'T ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THIS MONEY IS GOING TO BE WHETHER IT'S DIRECTLY PAID BY THE RATE PAYERS OR WHETHER IT'S PAID BY INCREASED INSURANCE COSTS. OR IF THE UTILITIES GO AWAY -- WHATEVER REPLACES THEM -- THIS IS A MAJOR PUBLIC PROBLEM THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND AGAIN NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT LEADING THE UTILITIES OFF THE HOOK -- WE WERE HOPING THAT LEGISLATIVE GUIDANCE WOULD HELP COURTS MOVING FORWARD WE RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DIVISION OF GOVERNMENT HERE AND IF IT'S YOU KNOW. UNCONSTITUTIONAL I'M SURE YOU'LL BE TOLD -- AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THE IT WOULD WE ARE MAIN GOAL HERE IS. THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO BASICALLY STABILIZE THE MARKETS -- AND WE ARE EXPECTATIONS IS A HARDENING OF THE COOLEY UP POLICIES THAT -- TO RESULT IN AND I THINK AND WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE -- TO THE MEETING THE NEEDS OF FIRE VICTIMS THANK THANK YOU CENTER HUESO [inaudible] AND CERTAIN MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- CENTER STONE WAS NEXT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR -- YOU KNOW I SEE THIS -- CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- ACTING IN A QUASI JUDICIAL WAY HERE. AS WE HEAR YOUR TESTIMONY AS WE HEAR THE TESTIMONY OF OF PRIOR PANELS [inaudible] AND I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY. THERE ARE SOME HERE THAT HAVE BETTER TOOLS -- EDUCATION LATER TO GUIDE US THROUGH THE PROCESS SO I SEE THINGS. AS THE PHARMACISTS LITTLE BIT MORE KIND OF BLACK AND WHITE. AND I I CAN TELL YOU THAT AS A A GUIDE HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR MYSELF FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST OVER REGULATED PROFESSIONS THAT BEING PHARMACY AND THEN COMPOUND PHARMACY AND THEN STERILE COMPOUND PHARMACY THAT. IF I DIDN'T -- CHANGE. THE PRACTICE LETTER I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH. FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS IDEA TO BUSINESS AND SO -- MISTER WEISSMAN A COUPLE OF ISSUES I'D LIKE. TO SHARE WITH YOU AND GET YOUR YOUR RESPONSE. THE FIRST ONE IS SAYING YOU HAD MENTIONED -- THE ON THE GOVERNOR'S -- A LINE IN THE SAND DISCUSSING TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND AND I FIND THAT. RATHER OFFENSIVE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF PROPERTY IN LIFE AND IN MY COLLEAGUES DISTRICT AND THE IN MANSIO. AND I THINK THAT THE PANEL BEFORE. OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEY MADE A VERY GOOD CASE THAT. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT INVERSE CONDEMNATION OR TALKING ABOUT INTENDED USE AS DESIGNED? NOW THAT'S NOT. IN ONE MOMENT IN TIME. THAT IS PROBABLY EIGHT LIVING. SCENARIO WHERE WE HAVE TO ADJUST WITH THE TIMES MY COLLEAGUE BRINGS UP THE FACT THAT WE HAVE CLIMATE CHANGE WE DO. AND I THINK THAT'S INCUMBENT ON THE UTILITIES. TO REBUILD MODIFY. SO THAT THE INTENDED USE IS DESIGNED TO TO CONVEY ELECTRICITY. AND TO ENSURE MAXIMUM SAFETY. OF FOR THE RESIDENTS. THAT NEED THAT ELECTRICITY SO. THERE WAS A HORRIFIC EVENT IN SAN DIEGO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND WE DIDN'T HAVE I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT TIME. A LITTLE BOARD SUPERVISORS BUT NINE SANDY UP IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. BUT I DON'T KNOW ADDRESS DGT CAME HERE REQUESTING THAT WE WE CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THEY DID WAS. THEY SAID OKAY. WE'D UP WE GOT BURNED NO NO NO PUN INTENDED HERE IT'S GOING TO COST US THE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND SOME SOME DAMAGES THAT -- OF ORGAN UP TO COME UP WITH THAT KIND OF FUNNY FUNDING AND BUT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS. AND SO THEY EMBRACED ON A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF TECHNOLOGY OVER TEN YEARS SO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. TO SAFEGUARD THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE SO THEY DID NOT HAVE TO RELIVE THAT. THAT FUTURE PROBLEM AGAIN THAT WAS THE DRIVING FORCE OBVIOUSLY THE PAIN OF THAT. HORRIFIC FIRE TO ENSURE THAT. THESE INCIDENTS DON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. AND OUR PRESENTATION THOUGH WE HAVE WITH PGE INANE JUST A DAY OR TWO AGO. IT IN THEIR PRESENTATION THEY SAID THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT THEY SPENT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. I'VE BEEN FIFTEEN FIFTEEN TIMES FOR THE SDG AND HE I THINK SD DID BGT HAS DONE A FABULOUS JOB THERE HAS BEEN ANY MORE INCIDENTS. I'D LIKE TO ASK. PGD WHAT WOULD YOU SPEND THE MONEY ON BECAUSE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEVASTATION -- THAT'S HAPPENED AND THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS [inaudible] SO. YOU DON'T INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES YOU KNOW -- M. UP PUBLICLY OWNED CAN -- UTILITIES ARE I GUESS ARE GIVEN A GUARANTEED RATE OF RETURN MAY GET EMINENT DOMAIN -- CAPABILITIES THEY BASICALLY ATAXIC AUTHORITY PENDING -- RATE INCREASE BY -- THE P. UC -- BUT THERE IS NO INVESTMENT GENTLEMAN THAT DOES NOT CARRY ANY RISK. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO DO TODAY. CONTRARY TO THE ADVICE OF ARE LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY SAID REPRESENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS AT THE PATH THAT YOU'RE ASKING US TO EMBARK ON IT IS NOT CONSTITUTIONAL. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS ARE CREATING THIS BIG CLOUD. OF HOPE FOR THE UTILITIES THAT WE ARE GOING UP PINE THE WAY THAT YOU WANT US TO OPINE. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING IT TO THE VERY ISSUES THAT OUR CITIZENS AT HOME THAT ARE LOS ARE SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED HOMES IN THE LOSS OF A PRECIOUS LIFE THAT WE LOST. THAT THEY WANT TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS AND SAY HOW WE CAN TO STOP THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN HOW WE GONNA. YOU KNOW GET ARE FORCED BACK IN SHAPE POVERTY CAN HAVE DO LIABILITY STANDARDS AND AND SAFETY STANDARDS CENTER HE'S EVER MET MARROW WRAPPED WHO WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE THEY'RE NOT NOBODY'S ASKING US TO DECIDE TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND I WISH. THAT YOU WOULD -- AT THIS TIME START ASKING SOME QUESTIONS SO WE CAN PICK UP HERE OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THEM. IT IS AMENABLE ALONG PROCESS WE HAVE FIFTEEN DAYS AND I ONCE TO MAKE PROGRESS AND I THINK THEY WERE BEING HAMSTRUNG -- BY THIS ONE ISSUE THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE PUSHING ASIDE LET THE COURTS DETERMINE NEEDS TO GOES ABA MISTER WEISSMAN I WANT YOU TO REACT -- TO THE CONSUMER ATTORNEY SAYS INTENDED USE AS DESIGNED RIGHT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT HOW YOU DESIGN YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE TEN YEARS AGO IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY YOU NEED DESIGNER INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY AND YOUR COMPANY HAS DONE AN A YEOMAN'S DOT JOB ACTUALLY OF A I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT OTHER UTILITIES HAVE DONE. THE SAME [inaudible] BUT IT. HAVE YOU NOT. PRETTY MUCH SUPPORTED WHAT. THE CONSUMER TOURNEY'S HAVE SAID THIS THAT YOU'VE. YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE REDEFINED YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE AS WAS NECESSARY FOR ITS INTENDED USE. SENATOR -- CERTAINLY A VERY IMPORTANT PART. OF THE OVERALLS SOLUTION IN REACTION TO THIS GREAT THREAT. IS FOR THE UTILITIES TO MODIFY THEIR SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE THEM. AND TO REDUCE THIS RISK AND AND THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WAS TALKED ABOUT THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY. WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT? OUT TODAY IS THAT EVEN IF UTILITIES TAKE ALL THOSE ACTIONS. AND EVEN IF THEY ARE WITHOUT FAULT. IT COULD NEVER THE LESS BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THE CURRENT INVERSE CONDEMNATION STANDARDS SO. ARE -- WE ARE SUPPORTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. TO MODIFY. THAT STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD TO SHIFT TO A REASONABLENESS STANDARD. AT THE SAME TIME. THAT THE UTILITIES UNDER THE SUPERVISION IN THE CASE OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES OF THE P. YOU SEE. MODIFY THEIR SYSTEMS TO REDUCE RISK. WELL THANK YOU AYE AYE PREPAID PRE SHOULD THAT ANSWER. I HOPE THAT OF WE CAN COME TO A CONCLUSION SOON ON THAT ON THIS ISSUE. I HINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL EVENTUALLY THE COURTS ARE GOING TO OPINE ON BUT WE HAVE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT -- WERE WERE ENTRUSTED TO PROTECT. AND AND AND THAT'S WHAT I TEND TO DO. AS MUCH LIKE HIM AND YOU KNOW IF THE TWEET. YOU KNOW -- INVERSE CONDEMNATION ISSUES WITH THE ATTORNEYS COMING TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING ONE THING THAT YOU'RE BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOT. REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ARE CAUSED BY EXTERNAL FACTORS AND YET WE HAD THE ATTORNEY COME UP AND TALK ABOUT THE CAR THAT HIT THE POLLS SAYS YOU KNOW. THAT YOU WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE SO I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF LEGAL LOOK OPINIONS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS BODY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO ARBITRATE THOSE DIFFERENCES [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES. THANK YOU MISTER. I THEIR TO COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. AND I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS -- MISTER WEISMAN ONE OF THE COMMENTS YOU MADE [inaudible] IS THAT IF YOU CHANGE STRICT LIABILITY TO REASONABLE STANDARD. THAT WOULD NOT DISINCENTIVE EYES UTILITIES TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND PREVENTION. BUT IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME TO KNOW THAT. WE HAD STRICT LIABILITY AND IT PREVENTION WAS NOT TAKEN CARE OF AND WE FIND OURSELVES WHO WE ARE NOW AND IF WE LOWER THE STANDARD. HOW HOWARD WHAT'S THE INCENTIVE GOING TO BE? TO DO THOSE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE FOR SAFETY FOR PREVENTION IF. THERE WASN'T ENOUGH INCENTIVE BEFORE. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE'S A FEW RESPONSES I WOULD OFFER FIRST OF ALL -- AGAIN. WERE AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO UTILITIES NEED TO CHANGE THEIR SYSTEMS AND PRACTICES. TO REDUCE THESE RISKS AND AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART. OF THE OVERALL PROGRAM AND AND A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE CASE OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND DIRECTION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION BUT I WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON IN FIRST CONDEMNATION. UTILITIES REMAIN LIABLE FOR NEGLIGENCE AND FOR FUN REASONABLE CONDUCT. WHICH IS THE NORMAL WAY THAT BUSINESSES AND AND OTHER ACTORS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE STANDARD THAT WE ALL FOLLOW WE WE HAVE TO AVOID ACTING IN A NEGLIGENT. FASHION WHAT'S UNIQUE HERE IS THAT LIABILITY ATTACHED IS EVEN IF UTILITIES ARE WITHOUT FAULT AND AND THAT'S NOT A STANDARD WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT FITS. THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WERE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SERIOUS RISK WITH VERY. SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND CONSEQUENCES. BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE THAT CAME BEFORETHE INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND THERE'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. GOD ARE OR ENTITIES. THE RIGHT TO EMINENT DOMAIN -- IT TO HAVE A RATE OF RETURN. IT THERE SO MUCH MORE. SO THIS IS PART OF A PACKAGE AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY SAYING ALRIGHT YOU ARE STRICTLY LIABLE. MOTHERS A WHOLE LOT MORE THAT CAME BEFORE THEM. AND SO YOU'LL RECEIVER NOT YOU WITH THE UTILITIES WILL RECEIVE ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF BEING A BECAUSE I GOVERNMENT ENTITY. BUT NOT TO THE LIABILITY THAT HAS BEEN IMPOSED UPON THEM BY THE CONSTITUTION SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND I I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND FIND IT WOULD BE CONSTITUTIONAL AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION THERE HAS BEEN TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT. I STILL DON'T SEE HOW WOULD BE CONSTITUTIONAL SO MAYBE I CAN TRY A LITTLE BIT MORE PASSIVE FIRST OF ALL THIS BILL WOULD NOT MAKE A DISTINCTION. BETWEEN MUNICIPAL UTILITIES AND INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. SO THAT THAT WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THEN MUNICIPAL UTILITIES WE WE BOTH FACE THIS PROBLEM. IN TERMS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION [inaudible] AND THE COURTS HAVE SAID THAT THE LEGISLATUREHASA VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN INTERPRETING THE CONSTITUTION THE SUPREME COURT HAS NEVER DECIDED WHAT IS THE STANDARD THAT SHOULD BE APPLIED IN A WILD FIRE CASE FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION THEY'VE NEVER ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. AND SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPRESS ITS VIEW ABOUT WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO APPROACH INVERSE CONDEMNATION LIABILITY. AND WE SUGGEST THAT THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD IS. A PERMISSIBLE CHOICE AND A WISE CHOICE GIVEN ALL THE REASONS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY I MIGHT SAY. CALIFORNIA AN ALABAMA ARE THE ONLY STATES IN THE UNION THAT HAVE A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND IN ALABAMA THAT DID NOT COME UP. IN A WILDFIRE CONTEXT EVERY OTHER STATES THE MAJORITY OF THE STATES IMPOSE INVERSE CONDEMNATION ONLY IF THERE'S INTENTIONAL CONDUCT. AND A MINORITY OF STATES IMPOSE IT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS. NEGLIGENT. BUT THERE'S NO OTHER STATE OTHER THAN CAP AND AND THAT THERE ARE STE ACTUALLY SOME DECISIONS FROM OTHER STATES THAT HAVE REJECTED INVERSE CONDEMNATION CLAIMS AND WILDFIRE CASES. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT HAS PERMITTED THOSE CLAIMS TO GO FORWARD UNDER STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD. SO THAT'S A SITUATION WHERE THE LEGISLATURE CAN EXERCISE ITS PREROGATIVE TO STEP IN AND SAY WE FEEL BASED ON ALL THESE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS YOU'VE HEARD. THAT A REASONABLENESS STANDARD IS MORE APPROPRIATE. AND WE THINK THE COURTS WOULD UPHOLD THAT CHOICE. AT THE MISTER NOT JUST BROKE JUST TO CLARIFY COMMENCEMENT CLARIFYING THAT [inaudible] BECAUSE IT DIDN'T ON THAT ANSWER RIGHT THERE LOOK AT REAL BRIEFLY TAKE TWO SECONDS. SO ARE YOU SAYINGTHAT BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU TAKE TWO SECONDS. SECOND [inaudible] YOU HAVE. I DO WE HAVE THE I GUESS THE QUESTION IF I MAY FINISH MY QUESTION SIR THANK YOU SENATOR. DIDN'T THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DID JUST ISSUE -- A DENIAL TO PJ AND THESE -- PETITION TO OVERRULE THE LOWER COURT DECISION. SPECIFICALLY ON INVERSE CONDEMNATION -- FROM THE BUTTE FIRE LAST NIGHT THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND CHARGES. IT WOULD. A GOOD ESL OFFER THREE OBSERVATIONS ON THAT. THEY FIRST OF FOR IF I MAY NOT A FIRST JUST TO CLARIFY THE SUPREME COURT'S ACTION WAS NOT A DECISION ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE. THEY SIMPLY EXERCISE THEIR PREROGATIVE NOT TO REVIEW THE CASE SECOND THE ISSUE THAT WAS PRESENTED IN THAT CASE WAS NOT WHETHER THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD SHOULD BE APPLIED. THE ISSUE IN THAT CASE WAS PITCHING HE ARGUED THAT INVERSE CONDEMNATION SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO IT BECAUSE IN LIGHT OF THE COMMISSION'S DECISION IN THE SAN DIEGO CASE. IT WASN'T A SHIRT OF THE ABILITY TO PASS THROUGH THOSE COSTS RIGHT THANK YOU -- CENTER CANNELLA [inaudible] OKAY. YES VERY SIMPLY THAT IF THE OTHER STATES [inaudible] CAN -- DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND BETWEEN ALABAMA CALIFORNIA TWO DIFFERENT. ARE IDENTICAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LAW THAT LIMITS STRICT LIABILITY. AND IT'S BEEN UPHELD CONSTITUTIONALLY DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER STATES YES. YES IN FACT THERE'S A CASE. JUST BRIEFLY THERE'S A CALIFORNIA CASE THAT SAYS WHERE THERE'S COURTS THAT HAVE DECIDED THE ISSUE IN DIFFERENT WAYS THE LEGISLATURE CAN PICK ONE OF THOSE WAYS. AND THAT WILL BE UPHELD AS BEING WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATE CANNELLA. THEY'VE SHERMAN SO JUST BRIEFLY AT THE END OF THIS IN VERSE CHO NATION I I FEEL LIKE THIS SHOULD BE THE LAST THING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S JUST IS TAKEN UP ABOVE. YOU KNOW ALL THE SPACE BUT I I THINK THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT IT REGARDLESS OF IF WE ACTUALLY DON'T ACT. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT ES DE JEANNIE AND AND HOW THEY'RE THE THE CO THE POSTER CHILD FOR HOW TO DO THINGS RIGHT. WELL THEY WERE RECENTLY I GUESS WE'RE RIESLING FORM THAT THEY'RE GOING AND WITH LESS THIS IS DEALT WITH THEY'RE GONNA BE DOWNGRADED -- THREE THREE STEPS OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT SO THAT'S GONNA COST AS MUCH I THINK THAT'S THE REASON WE TALK ABOUT AGAIN THAT I'D RATHER BE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THESE FIRES AND HOW DO WE FUEL MANAGEMENT ALL THAT BUT I TRUST OUR OUR CO CHAIRS THAT. WE WILL GET TO THAT. BUT DO A QUESTION SO THE CONSUMER ATTORNEY WAS VERY STE MISTRIAL YOU BASICALLY SAID THE GUY FROM IF YOU SEE MISLED US WHEN HE WAY TESTIFIED. SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUTTHE THIS INVERSE CORRELATION INTO MY UNDERSTANDING WAS IN AND AGAIN ABOT ATTORNEY. THAT IF P. GINNY OR ARE YOU TO LOOK UP IS 1% RESPONSIBLE -- AND THEY HAVE TO PAY A HUNDRED SO THE COST IS THAT ACTORS THAT NOT ACCURATE THE LEGAL STANDARD IS TO HAVE TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL BECAUSE WHAT'S WHAT'S SUBSTANTIAL. AND THAT'S A CASE BY CASE DETERMINATION ROUGHLY I MEAN APPROXIMATELY -- I WOULD SAY IT'S LESS THAN 50% LESS OKAY SO SOFA TRUCK HIT A POLE AND AND SORT OF FIRE THEY WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT A TRUCK AT A POLL BUT I GIVE YOU I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER CASE -- WITCHES LET'S. I'M CERTAINLY SPEAK OVER YOU -- THIS IS THE SITUATION MISTER ARCHER BROUGHT UP WHERE THERE IS A TREE BRANCH THAT'S NOT WITHIN THE RIGHT AWAY NOT WITHIN THE CURRENT SOUND THAT FLOWS INTO THE LINE. AND THE FIRE STARTS AND IT SPREADS TO A LARGE AREA. THAT WOULD BE A SITUATION WHERE INVERSE CONDEMNATION WOULD BE APPLIED EVEN THOUGH THE UTILITY WAS WITHOUT FAULT [inaudible] I THINK THANK YOU A CENTER BASE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES. OF MISTER ORCHARD I YOU ARE THE CEO OF OF*IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY AND JUST LOOKING AT YOUR ANNUAL REPORTER LOOKS LIKE A YOU. YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY GOOD FINANCIAL STANDING IN FACT YOUR THE CRATER BOMB AGENCIES SMP. COMBAT HAS HE WAS AS A DOUBLE A ZACH WE PERCEIVE SEVERAL A GREAT LOSS COUPLE HERE AND AND SO IS A BIT UP TO YOU BEEN UPGRADING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS YES. WHICH IS INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM THE GENTLEMAN IN THE LAST PANEL. pARE -- AND THE ARROW USE HAVE THE EXACT SAME LIABILITY. A FOR INVERSE SO WHY IS IT THAT THE P. YOU USE CREDIT RATINGS ARE GOING UP. AND THE I USE ARE GOING DOWN DO YOU THINK TO GIVE ANY OPINION ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW -- WE HAVE HAD A CORE. FROM PA CAR RATING AGENCIES AROUND OUR WILD FIRE RISK THOSE NON QUESTIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON OUR MITIGATION MEASURES AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT. RISK -- WE ALSO HAVE A STRONG HISTORY OF OUR BOARD. OUR ELECTED BOARD BEING VERY WILLING. TO ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN NECESSARY SO IT ESSENTIALLY -- IS AN INDICATION THAT WE WILL CHARGE OUR CUSTOMERS FOR WHATEVER IS NECESSARY SO I THINK THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IS -- DRIVEN -- THEM TO TO PROVIDER UPGRADES AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE'RE DOING AND AND THE USE DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY OTHER THAN IF THE P. YOU SEE GRANTS THEM ABOUT ABILITY TO DO THAT THAT IS MY AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AND THEN I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. LA DWP WHICH I THINK IS THE LARGEST -- THAT IN IN THE STATE THAT THEY'RE ALSO ON THEIR CREDIT RATING IS ALSO VERY GOOD THINK IT DOUBLE A WITH WITH SMP HIGHEST SO WITH WITH MOODY'S IF I UNDERSTAND THAT. A QUICKLY -- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WITHIN SMUTS SERVICE TERRY TERRITORY IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE LIABLE? FOR SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS NUMBER BECAUSE OF UNDER STRICT LIABILITY WHAT WOULD YOU DO YOU SELL -- WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY PASS THOSE COSTS ON TO WORK CUSTOMER SO WITH A WITH THE MASSIVE INCREASES IN THE BILLS THEY PAY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDING OUR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. WHAT WE WOULD DO THOUGH IS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THAT QUITE FRANKLY WE WOULD LOOK AT HOW DO WE MINIMIZE ALL OF OUR OTHER EXPENSES? SO THAT COULD MEAN THAT WHILE WE HAVE BEEN FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THE STATE THAN THAN IS REQUIRED BY THE STATE AND PROCURING RENEWABLES INVESTING ELECTRIC. RITESH AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THAT WOULD CAUSE US TO PULL BACK THOSE INVESTMENTS TO MINIMIZE. THE RATE IMPACTS TO THE TO THE EXTENT WE WOULD SO WOULD RESHUFFLE HOW WE SPEND MONEY WE WOULD CONTINUE TO MEET THE MINIMUM STANDARDS REQUIRED BY THE STATE. BECAUSE THAT'S OUR LEGAL OBLIGAION BUT WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF GOING FAR BEYOND THAT. IN REALITY THAT WOULD PROBABLY CAUSE US -- TO TO RE BALLOTS BASED ON THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS TO OUR CUSTOMER. DID YOU DID YOU CAN ASSIMILATE SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS -- THAT WOULD BE JUST A MASSIVE MASSIVE RATE INCREASE -- I WISH Y. CFO'S HERE SHE COULD DO IT IN HER HEAD -- BY -- IT WOULD BE. PROBABLY A 40% RATE INCREASE FOR US SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE AVERAGE BUSINESS FOR THE AVERAGE BUILT 40% MORE AT A MINIMUM. CAN THANK YOU. OKAY -- THE LAST -- ONE HERE ON SENATOR JACKSON'S. YES THANK YOU -- AT APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AYE SO I CAN PUT ON THE RECORD MY A CONSTERNATION OVER YOUR OBSERVATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DISCUSSION MISTER WISEMAN. THAT THIS WOULD APPLY ONLY STARTING N JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR WHICH MEANS OF THE COMMUNITY I REPRESENT. WHICH HAD NOW THE SECOND LARGEST WILDFIRE WHICH COST OVER A THOUSAND HOMES IN TWENTY THREE LIVES BUT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THAT WE SHOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT -- I AM NOT OKAY WITH THAT AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW SUFFERING. A THROUGH THESE FIRES TO THE CAR FIRED ALL IF THE IT IF THE UTILITIES WERE LIE -- HAD -- RESPONSIBILITY THAT THEY WOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM WHAT WE KNOW AND COURSE THAT THOSE FIRES WERE NOT. BECAUSE BY THE UTILITY COMPANIES AND ISN'T IT A FACT THAT INVERSE ONLY APPLIES WHEN THE UTILITIES BECAUSE OF FIRE. IS THAT CORRECT YES ARE SO. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE -- IT SEEMS YOU'VE OT TO IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY ES NOW MOVING FROM STRICT LIABILITY -- WITH ELECTRICAL TO THE THE WAY WE DO -- FLOOD POLICIES IS TO TRY TO EQUATE THE TWO THAT WILL JUSTIFY POTENTIALLY AT LEAST IN YOUR EYES MOVING FROM A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD TO A REASONABLE STANDARD IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S HOW YOU GET THERE. I WOULD TRY TO CLARIFY -- THAT THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS. ONE QUESTION IS DOES THE LEGISLATURE HAVE AUTHORITY. TO ADOPT A REASONABLENESS STANDARD AND THAT QUESTION. FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE COULD BE INTERPRETED IN MORE THAN ONE WAY. THE FACT THAT THE FLOOD CONTROL CASES DID IT THAT WAY SHOWS THAT THAT'S A POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION THE SECOND QUESTION IS. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT A REASONABLENESS STANDARD. AND WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT'S PARTLY INFLUENCED BY THE CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FLOOD CONTROL CONTEXT. BUT ALSO PARTLY INFLUENCED BY ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU HEARD TODAY IN TERMS OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE STATE. OF A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD. BUT AS WAS POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYWOMAN -- FROM [inaudible] RIVERSIDE COUNTY. SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. WE NOW HAVE A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD AND COMPANIES LIKE P. CHENEY WHICH ARE NOT HERE TODAY FOR WHATEVER REASON -- HAVE BEEN FOUND LIABLE EVEN UNDER NEGLIGENCE THERE THAT THEY HAVEN'T EVEN DONE THAT LEVEL SO WHY SHOULD WE REDUCE THEIR LIABILITY -- AND EXPECT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO MORE. WITH LESS LIABILITY BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC BEHIND THAT COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A CRACK AT THAT'S ASSURE [inaudible] I THINK. WHAT YOU JUST POINTED OUT IS THAT THE STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD HE IS NOT EFFECTIVE? IN A CHANGING UTILITY BEHAVIOR AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS OTHER THINGS PROPOSED. TO HAVE MUCH BETTER WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS TO HAVE INCREASED PENALTIES TO HAVE ANNUAL REVIEWS WITH FINES THINGS IT WILL DO A DIRECTLY TO SHAREHOLDER PROFITS. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WHICH I'M WILL BE EFFECTIVE INVERSE CONDEMNATION UNTIL THE US TO JEANNIE CASE AT ALL WE CAN PASS THROUGH TO THE RATE PAYERS. AND SO IT HASN'T BEEN AN EFFECTIVE TOOL EXCEPT THAT THE FACT THAT IT DID GET PASS THROUGH TO THE RATE PAYERS WAS PART OF THE INCENTIVE. THICK WITH THAT ES DE ANY -- SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC TO HARDEN THEIR SYSTEM AND MAKE IT THE GOLD STANDARD ISN'T THAT RIGHT NO ACTUALLY. THE AT SEG ANY EXPECTED LIKE IT AND ALL CASES IN THE PAST THAT IT WOULD BE PASSED THE RATE PAYERS. AND WOOD NOT BECAUSE SHAREHOLDERS ANYTHING AND NEVER THE LESS THEY SPIT AND PARKED IN A TEN YEAR PROGRAM TO MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER. SO. ITEM THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR LOGIC HERE FORGIVE ME IT'S LIKE AS I SAID THE OTHER DAY. IT'S IT'S IT'S LIKE THE GUY WHO KILLED HIS PARENTS AND GOES BEFORE THE COURT AND BEG FOR MERCY BECAUSE HE'S AN ORPHAN. I JUST AND DOESN'T AND NO ONE SEEMS TO GET THERE TODAY ANY BETTER THAN THEY DID THE OTHER DAY. BUT BASICALLY YOU'RE ASKING FOR YOU'RE ASKING FOR A LESSER PENALTY. BECAUSE YOU DID WORSE BEHAVIOR SAYING THAT ACTUALLY IF THE OPPOSITE SENATOR WELL I I I WOULD HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY INCREASING PENALTIES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS INCREASED PENALTIES BILL BUT IT REDUCES LIABILITY. I I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT LET ME LET ME GO ONE THAT. YOU COULD TRY TO ANALOGIZE HAS TO A NORMAL BUSINESS SITUATION BUT PART OF THE REASON THAT WE ASK YOU WOULD THAT WE REQUIRE THAT YOU MAINTAIN HIGHER STANDARDS. IS BECAUSE WE'VE LET YOU BECOME A MONOPOLY AND WE FLETCHER CHIU COME IN AND AT BE ABLE -- TO IMPOSE EASEMENTS ON OUR PROPERTY ON OUR PRIVATE PROPERTY NO PRIVATE ENTITY GETS TO NOBODY'S TO DO THAT WE GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO HAVE THESE PRINTS ARE ON OUR PROPERTY AND FOR GOING TO DO THAT. DON'T LET IT SHOULDN'T WE BE ENTITLED TO EXPECT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPERTY NOW THAT YOU GOT THE RIGHT KEVIN EASTMAN ACROSS AND PUT YOUR POLLS UP -- OUT YOU KNOW ON MY PROPERTY HERE MANY FENCE LINE OR OTHER PEOPLE'S WHY SHOULD WE SAY TO YOU THAT WASHER WE NOW SAY WELL LET'S LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE ANY OTHER BUSINESS YOU'RE NOT BAD. HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THAT SO -- WHAT GOES WITH FEE OUR AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE EMINENT DOMAIN IS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICE IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE WHICH IS NOT AN OBLIGATION THAT IS IMPOSED ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS? SO THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER THE UTILITIES SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER THE UTILITIES. SHOULD BE LIABLE IN THE EVENT THAT THE ACT AND RECENTLY THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE. IF THERE WITHOUT FAULT IN CARRYING OUT THAT PUBLIC SERVICE WILL BUT WE REQUIRE THAT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS WITH GOVERNMENT AND AND PART OF THE REASON IS IT NOT. BECAUSE WHEN LAWYERS GET TOGETHER AND I WANT TO SOME MOPPING CRITICAL. IS WE'RE GONNA FIGHT OVER THE LIABILITY ISSUE FIRST START WEEK THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IF IT IF WE HAVE STRICT LIABILITY IN NO FAULT THAT ISSUE WE SKIP OVER THAT WE GO TO WATER THAT WHAT OF THE COMPENSATION WHAT'S. ONE OF THE DAMAGES. BUT IN THIS CASE AND THAT'S WERE PART OF THE REASO IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THAT WE'VE HAD DISTRICT LIABILITIES BECAUSE WE WANT TO TRY TO MAKE THE VICTIMS HOLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ESOS WITNESSES TESTIFIED EARLIER THEIR HOMES THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE LIVING SOMEWHERE ELSE THEIR LIVES HERE UP IN IN THE AIR THEY WANT TO GET BACK TO TO CREATIVELY DOING THEIR HOMES REBUILDING OR FINDING ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE A REBUILDING THEIR BUSINESSES. SO WHEN YOU HAVE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS FOR OUR INVERSE CONDEMNATION -- LAWS TODAY IS THAT IT EXPEDITED THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE VICTIMS ARE ABLE TO GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES BUT ISN'T IT TRUE THAT IF WE IF WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT REASONABLE LISTEN RETIREMENT NEGLIGENCE. THIS IS GOING TO BE A FOUR FIVE YEAR BATTLE IN A COURT ROOM AND THESE PEOPLE ARE SITTING THERE WITH THE CLOCK TICKING THEY MIGHT GET TWO YEARS WORTH OF COMPA. PAYMENTS FOR A FOR LIVING IN UNDER THEIR INSURANCE POLICIES. IT ISN'T PARA REASON FOR THIS SENATE AND ISN'T THAT REASON -- ONE THAT HELPS THE VICTIMS OF THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR OF THE FACT THAT YOUR THAT YOUR UTILITIES HAVE CAUSED THE FIRE WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN HARDENED OR NOT HARDEN PROPERLY. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY REAL SUBSTANDARD AND THE AND I'VE YET TO HEAR PEACHY ANY TALK ABOUT SAFETY. AND AND PREVENTION AND YOU FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT YOUR FIRST THING IS STABILIZING MARKETS MY PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO TO PREVENT THESE FIRES HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT PIE SMALLER HOW YOU GOING TO DO THAT WITH THE SYSTEM YOU'RE. PROPOSING [inaudible] SENATE JACKSON. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES DOING EXACTLY THAT MAKING THE SYSTEM SAFER. IT'S THAT WE ABSOLUTELY ENTIRELY VICTIMS NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE AND THEY NEED TO MEAN MADE WHOLE QUICKLY. THAT'S WHAT INSURANCE IS. FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER YOU WANT TO MAKE RATE PAYERS THE INSURANCE COMPANY. OR SHAREHOLDERS OR MAKE THE COMPANIES DO THEIR JOBS AWAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO NOT GIVE UP BONUSES AND NOT TALK ABOUT SECURITY AND NOT TALK ABOUT PREVENTION. WE ABSOLUTELY WANT UTILITIES TO DO THEIR JOB THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED. TO THANK SENATOR DODD CARRIED A BILL. S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO DO EXACTLY THAT TO HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE AND TO FIND THEM NEGLIGENT FIND THEM NOT REASONABLE PRUDENT IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THEIR PLANTS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE PROPOSAL DOES. THE MEMBER WOULD. MAKE YOU I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LITERALLY THE LAST ONE ALRIGHT PARA CLOSED I THINK WE'RE ALL DONE I THINK EVERYBODY'S ASK THE QUESTIONS THAT FOR ME SO REALISTICALLY. HOW LONG WOULD SOME OF THESE PLANS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S CALLING FOR IN HIS -- IN HIS A PROPOSAL HERE TAKE. FOR YOU GUYS. TO ENACT REALISTICALLY. UNDER THE TIME LINES. THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. BY NEXT JULY FIRST. THE PROPOSALS WOULD BEGIN. THE COMMISSION WE WOULD HOPE WOULD ACT VERY QUICKLY ON THAT PUSHED THROUGH IT LANGUAGES STRIVE THEY THAT'S RIGHT DR AND WE ARE CERTAINLY AMENABLE TO STRENGTHENING THAT LANGUAGE I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CASE TO BE MADE THAT. THE COMMISSION OUGHT TO BE GIVEN A HARD DEADLINE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION HAS A HISTORY OF TAKING LONGER THAN IT SHOULD. AND IF HE AND THE WISDOM OF THIS COMMITTEE YOU WANNA MODIFY THAT TO PUT IN A HARDER DEADLINE. I THINK YOU FIND A LOT OF RECEPTIVENESS FROM SOME OF US. A QUESTION I THOUGHT AND IF I DIDN'T SAY IT THIS WAY COLLEGE EYES HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU TO ENACT THOSE PLANS WE KNOW THAT AS THE GENIE HAS BEEN WORKING ON THESE. OVER TEN YEARS SO REALISTICALLY SMART BOMBS NOW. HOW LONG YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING WORK OBVIOUSLY -- THE MARKET SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU'RE DOING -- HOW LONG? DOES IT TAKE TO PUT THESE PLANS INTO EFFECT WHAT THE PLANS AND THE PLANS HAVE TO EVOLVE OVER TIME AND I CONDITIONS CHANGE THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF IT SO. IT IS -- YOU PLAN AND THEN YOU YOU LAY OUT A TIMELINE SO FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE INCREASING -- WE'VE INCREASED OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TO MOVE OUTSIDE OF THEIR RIGHTS OF WAY AND STARTING TO NEGOTIATE WITH -- PROPERTY OWNERS TO REMOVE. PALM TREES IN THEIR RIGHTS OF WAY WE ARE -- INVESTING MORE IN I'M TECHNOLOGY TO DEATH. TO DETECT A PROBLEM TREES LIKE LET LIGHT ARE. EXTREME -- TO DETECT LE ABOUT FAULT LINES IN SAYS. I'M SO IT'S IT'S THERE IT'S A MULTIPLE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THERE'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IT'S ALSO GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT IS YOUR SERVICE TERRITORY LOOK LIKE WHAT IS YOUR EMPIRE MET LOOK LIKE -- SITE I SUSPECT -- THE PLANTS THAT NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE WILL LOOK DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT UTILITIES DEPENDING ON THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. AND IT PROBABLY WILL TAKE -- A FEW YEARS OF INVESTMENT TO MOVE ON BUT I ALSO THINK THIS IS SOMETHING YOU SHOT ONE AND DONE THIS ISA PROGRAM THAT PROBABLY LAST. FOR EVER QUITE FRANKLY THAT UTILITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO STEP UP THE GAME AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED TO STRENGTHEN OUR SYSTEM. I WOULD EXPECT THOSE PLANS TO BE AMENDED TO INCORPORATE THOSE NEW TECHNOLOGIES INTO HEARTENING SYSTEM. I GUESS I GUESS -- AND MAYBE THIS IS A ROUNDABOUT WAY OF OF TRY AND MAKE ONE OF THE POINTS THAT SENATOR JACKSON'S MAKING AND MAYBE IT MAYBE IT'S NOT MAYBE IT'S JUST WAY OUT THEE SOMEWHERE. BUT I GUESS I'M I'M STRUGGLING WITH. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGES IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT LIABILITY. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLANS IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH. AND YOU WANT THAT YOU GUYS WANT THAT NOW. BUT THESE PLANTS MIGHT TAKE YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH. AND THERE IS A FEAR THAT. SOME THE UTILITIES HAVEN'T DONE WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GET ANY ASSURANCE? THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO. WHAT YOU SAY YOU'RE GONNA NOW BECAUSE THE RECORD AT LEAST FOR ONE UTILITY AND I'M NOT THIS IS NOT DIRECT TO YOU SIR BECAUSE OF HERE AT THIS YEAR IT'S NOT? THE REGULARS FOR WHAT YOU TO IT IS THAT IT ISN'T HASN'T HAPPENED AND SO. WHO WERE ASKED YOU IN SOME WAYS ARE SAYING LIKE TRUST US WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS DONE THE TRACK RECORDS DON'T? DON'T FOLLOW THAT COURSE AND I AND THAT'S PART OF THE CONCERN. UP ALL I CAN SUGGEST AN AND TOM ALL DEFERRED OR COLLEAGUES THAT IS THAT -- PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SETS A HIGHER STANDARD FOR UTILITIES IN THESE NEW PLANTS. SO IF YOU VIOLATE THAT NEW STANDARD YOU WILL BE LIABLE SO FOR FOR ME SPEAKING FROM SOME OUTSIDE. THAT'S A HUGE INCENTIVE TO MOVE QUICKLY WERE ALREADY MOVING QUICKLY BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE BROADER RISK AND OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. OUR ONLY OPTION IS TO PASS IT ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OBVIOUSLY I WORK FOR SEVEN ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO HATE EVERY RATE INCREASE BUT DO IT PRUDENTLY. SO. WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD TO LIMIT THAT LIABILITY AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AND I GUESS I GO BACK TO BUT COMMENT THAT. FRUSTRATES FRUSTRATED ME WHEN I HEARD -- PRESIDENT PICKER SAY. AND MAY GOD TAKING THIS OUT OF CONTEXT IS IS BUT OUR JOB IS TO SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN THAT. I'M SORRY THAT. DOESN'T JIVE WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYINGTO ACCOMPLISH HERE MISTER WHAT I I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE ANYTHING ON FAITH YOU NEED TO IMPROVE THE REGULATORY SYSTEM AND HOLD THE COMMISSION'S FEET TO THE FIRE AND GIVE THEM. A BETTER REGULATORY SYSTEM SO THAT THEY CAN. DO THEIR JOB PROPERLY AND MAKE THE UTILITIES TO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO ALL DUE RESPECT WE GIVE THEM DIRECTION. A LOT OF TIMES AND QUITE FRANKLY SOMETIMES THE TO TAKE AWAY A LONG TIME TO IMPLEMENT THAT. OR SOMETIMES SOME WAS ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE THEY IGNORE IT LET'S DO WITH CONSTRICTED DEADLINES. THANK YOU I THINK IT THROUGH JERRY. WELL THANK YOU I THINK THE QUESTION THAT I WAS GOING TO HOUSES SORT OF ADDRESSED IN YOUR RESPONSE. A BUT WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL. AND I BELIEVE WE'VE EXHAUSTED THE QUESTIONS FOR YOU FOR TODAY THANK YOU. SO WE MOVED TO PANEL. THREE AND THAT WILL INCLUDE TOM ALONG LITIGATION DIRECTOR. FOR THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. MICHAEL SHAW VICE PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. AND MICHAEL LOOK ADORABLE. WEST COAST ADVISER. ADVISORS AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AGRICULTURAL ENERGY CONSUMERS THIS [inaudible] WELCOME. AND WILL BEGIN NOW TOM LAW THANK YOU. CO CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING TURN TO SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE OF RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYERS. REGARDING WILDFIRE LIABILITY ISSUES. I AM LEGAL DIRECTOR OF TURN AND HAVE BEEN LITIGATING A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES AT THE CPUC FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. STARTING POINT FOR THE RATE PAYER PERSPECTIVE HAS TO BE THE INCREASING. ON AFFORDABILITY OF UTILITY BILLS. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST. ELECTRIC RATES IN THE NATION FAR TOO MANY RATE PAYERS. ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO PAY THEIR ENERGY BILLS. DISCONNECTION RATES ARE STEADILY RISING WITH MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS GETTING THEIR SERVICE SHUT OFF IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR. WHICH IS A 60% INCREASE FROM JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. SERVICE BUT SHUT OFF RATES IN SOME COMMUNITIES RANGE FROM 20%. TO ITS HIGHEST 32%. THE CHALLENGE OF AFFORDABILITY IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. OUR ALREADY HIGH ENERGY RATES ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE WELL ABOVE INFLATION. TO PAY FOR A WIDE RANGE OF UTILITY PROGRAMS. IN REGARDS TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION. KEEP IN MIND THAT CALIFORNIA'S RATE PAYERS ARE THE ONES PAYING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR. FOR ALL OF THE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION ACTIVITIES OF THE UTILITIES. UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS DO NOT PAY FOR THIS PREVENTION WORK. AND AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF PGD CUSTOMERS. RATEPAYERS ARE NOT GETTING GOOD RESULTS FOR THEIR MONEY. AS SHOWN BY THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES. AGAINST THAT BACKDROP IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT RATE PAYERS ARE ALREADY PAYING MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE WITH MIXED RESULTS. RAY PAIR SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT RIGHTFULLY BELONG TO THE UTILITIES PERIOD. FOR WILDFIRES TURN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUTTING CONSUMERS AND FIRE VICTIMS. FOR FOR WILD FIRES CAUSED BY UTILITY NEGLIGENCE. RATEPAYERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE MISTAKES AND MISMANAGEMENT OF THE UTILITIES NO WAY NO HOW. TRY TELLING NORTH BAY FIRE VICTIMS THAT THEIR ENERGY BILLS WILL GO UP. BECAUSE P. GENIE DIDN'T DO THE TREE TRIMMING IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. WITH THEIR RATE PAYERS DOLLARS. ALSO WEAKENING UTILITY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MAKING MISTAKES IS BAD POLICY. BECAUSE IT DESTROYS UTILITY INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE WILDFIRE PREVENTION. WE NEED MORE ACCOUNTABILITY NOT LESS. THIS IS WHY TURN HAS BEEN ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHTS. CHANGES TO THE CPUC REVIEW PROCESS. THE BILL WEAKENS THE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY OF UTILITIES BY ELIMINATING UTILITIES RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT PRUDENTLY. AND REPLACING IT WITH THE VAGUE AND INEFFECTIVE REQUIREMENT TO ONLY. QUOTE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLY. WITH A UTILITY DRAFTED SAFETY PLAN. WE URGE YOU TO REJECT THESE PROVISIONS OF SB. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND WE ALSO CALLING YOU TO REJECT AB. THIRTY THREE WHOSE BASIC PREMISES THAT RATEPAYERS AND NOT UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD PROVIDE UP FRONT FUNDING FOR SECURITIZATION COSTS RESULTING FROM P. GENIES NEGLIGENCE. AGAIN REPAIRS ALREADY PAY FOR PREVENTION COSTS SO WHY SHOULD WE ALSO BE EXPECTED TO PAY EVEN TEMPORARILY. FOR ANY COSTS RESULTING FROM UTILITY NEGLIGENCE. NOW SWITCHING TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN REGARDS TO WILD FIRES ARE CAUSED BY UTILITY FACILITIES BUT NOT THE RESULT OF UTILITY NEGLIGENCE. TURN SUGGESTS EXPLORING A BROAD BASED COMPENSATION MECHANISM THAT EQUITABLY ALLOCATES COMPENSATION FOR CATASTROPHIC LOSSES AND DOESN'T FURTHER BURDEN RATEPAYERS. THE FUNDING SOLUTIONS NEED TO LOOK BEYOND THE UTILITIES SECTOR. BECAUSE WILD FIRES ARE NOT JUST A UTILITY ISSUE. AS FOR SEEING ALL TOO WELL FROM THE CAR FIRE AND OTHER FIRES HIS HERE. WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS LIKE A FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND. WHICH USES A MODEST SURCHARGE ON INSURANCE POLICIES TO COVERAGE CATASTROPHIC LOSSES. PERFORMING THE STANDARD. OF LIABILITY FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IS ONE WAY. BUT NOT THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS FROM ULTIMATELY PAYING LIABILITY COSTS. IT'S WORTHWHILE IDEA BUT NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS TODAY. ULTIMATELY DEVELOPING A BROAD BASE COMPENSATION MECHANISM IS COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING. AND NOT SOMETHING WE BELIEVE THAT CAN BE THOUGHTFULLY RESOLVED IN A FEW WEEKS. TURNER DID YOU NOT TO LET P. GENIES TRUMPED UP CRISIS CAMPAIGN. SCARE YOU INTO ACCEPTING THE OVER REACHING PROPOSALS DRAFTED BY P. JEANNIE. REGARDING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY FIRES THE TRUTH IS WE HAVE A DANGEROUSLY INCOMPLETE PICTURE OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. BECAUSE WITHOUT THE TUBS FIRE FINDINGS WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH PROPERTY DAMAGE WILL BE THE RESULT OF UTILITY NEGLIGENCE. AND HOW MUCH WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE. TWO OTHER CAUSES. SO IT'S PREMATURE TO CONSIDER BILLS LIKE A. B. THIRTY THREE UNTIL WE HAVE SOME IDEA OF HOW MUCH OF THE WILDFIRE LIABILITY COSTS. RIGHTFULLY BELONG TO UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS. NOW AS FOR P. GINNY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION. BLOOMBERG REPORTED LAST WEEK THE VIEW OF A HIGHLY RESPECTED CREDIT RESEARCH FIRM THE PGD HAS ENOUGH CASH TO ABSORB TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN WILDFIRE CLAIMS. SO WHAT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO BY THE END OF THIS MONTH TWO THINGS. FIRST ADOPT A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED LEGISLATION. THE NON INVERSE CONDEMNATION PART. THAT DIRECTS THE UTILITIES TO SUBMIT UPDATED WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS TO THE CPC IN. TWENTY NINETEEN FOR EXPEDITED REVIEW AND APPROVAL AND DO THIS IN THE UTILITIES GENERAL RATE CASES. THIS WILL EXPERT ADOPTION OF KEY SAFETY MEASURES WALK WITHOUT GIVING THE UTILITIES A BLANK CHECK FOR SPENDING THAT WASTES REPAIR MONEY. SECOND AB SORRY CAN YOU BRING YOUR COMMISSARIAT YES THIS IS THE LAST POINT THANK YOU. SECOND CONVENE A WORKING GROUP OF EXPERTS TO DEVELOP A STATEWIDE WILDFIRE COMPENSATION MECHANISM TO MAKE UTILITY RELATED. WHILE FIRE VICTIMS HOLE AS WELL AS VICTIMS OF NON UTILITY RELATED WILDFIRES. BRING IN EXPERTS FROM OTHER STATES SUCH AS FLORIDA TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH SIMILAR CATASTROPHIC FUNDS AND THEN DEVELOP A PROPOSAL TO BE ADOPTED. DURING THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE YEAR. THANK YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS [inaudible] BUT YOU. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I MISTER CHAIRMAN -- MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION -- FIRST I EH IF HE CAN'T BE SAID ENOUGH THAT DIED THAT MANY WOMEN WHO ARE OUT FIGHTING THE FIRES RIGHT NOW DESERVE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF HONOR FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING THE SACRIFICE THAT THEY'RE MAKING IT STRUCK ME YESTERDAY. LST COUPLE DAYS TO SEE FIREFIGHTERS FROM TEXAS AND ALABAMA AND ALL OVER THE FRANKLY FROM SNIP PLACES IN THE WORLD. HERE AT THE OVER AT THE HYATT -- HERE TO HELP FIGHT THE FIGHT AND IT'S TELLING OF THE COMMUNITY OF FIREFIGHTERS AND I THINK THAT IS A SACRIFICE IT WE CANNOT -- AND COMMITMENT THAT WE CAN HONOR ENOUGH. I AT THIS POINT  YOU KNOW WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LEGISLATURE THIS COMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR FOCUS ON WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE LIMITED TIME THAT REMAINS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD EMBRACE A TIMELY PRUDENT AND DELIBERATE PROCESS A TO DRESS A COMPLEX COMBINATION OF ISSUES GOING FORWARD WITH WILDFIRE LIABILITY AS WELL AS PREVENTIONS. I AS A PROFESSOR WAR -- ADDRESSED -- AT THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING THERE MANY COMPLEX ISSUES RELATED TO LAND USE CURRENT ZONING COST EFFECTIVENESS LIABILITY COST RECOVERY -- IT THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO CONSIDER ALL IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS UP CERTAINLY THAT IS NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE CAPABILITIES OF ANYBODY HERE IN THIS ROOM. UP BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE FOLLOWING ITEMS. FIRST AND FOREMOST RESPONDING TO THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF THOSE WH HAVE SFFERED LOSSES IN THE FIRES OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE FIRES ARE CURRENTLY BURNING TODAY -- SECOND TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO REDUCE THE RISK AND MITIGATE THE SIZE A FUTURE FIRES THROUGH VARIOUS ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE SUCH AS REDUCING FUELS -- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT FUEL POTENTIALLY IN DIFFERENT DIFFERENT WAYS. GOING FORWARD THE OTHER FORMAL Y. BILLION PROVISION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN A LARGER CONTEXT. I'D IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD NOT LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER IN THE LARGER CONTEXT AND WE SHOULD CONSIDER AT ANOTHER TIME. WE SHOULD SPEND THE TIME AND LIMITED TIME AND ENERGY THAT REMAINS. ON OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE MORE IMMEDIATE IMPACT I THINK A SENATOR -- JACKSON INCIDENT WOULD HIGHLIGHTED A SHORT WHILE AGO. WE ALSO BELIEVE YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO HOLD UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS NOT REPAIRS RESPONSIBLE FOR A WHILE FIRE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM UTILITY NEGLIGENCE. PUTTING HIS GOVERNOR SAID THE LAW MUST ESTABLISH A IN HIS PROPOSAL HOW LONG ASSIST ABBAS POWERFUL INCENTIVES FOR UTILITIES TO DELIVER POWER SAFELY. AND WAS TOLD THOSE WHO FOUGHT WHO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE. AND I SAY THAT ONLY TO HIGHLIGHT IT NOT TO IMPLY THAT ANYONE HAS SUGGESTED THAT WE DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT -- I WOULD AGREE WITH -- THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM TURN MISTER LONG AND THAT WE'RE GOING INCIDENTS WERE UTILITY FACILITIES WERE -- BECAUSE BUT NOT NOT THE NET NOT NOT INVOLVING NEGLIGENCE -- THAT THERE AT THE CONSTRICTED ACCRETION OF FIND YOU KNOW COULD BE A WAY FOR US TO HELP ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. SO I WON'T REITERATE UP THOSE POINTS. I EXCEPT TO SAY THAT ELECTRICITY RATE PAYERS SHOULD NOT. AND CANNOT BE THE SOLE SOURCE. OF THAT REVENUE. I BECAUSE THOSE ARE COSTS THAT WILL BE IMPOSED ON OUR BUSINESSES ON OUR RESIDENTS. WHICH IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO CREATE JOBS IN IMPACTS THE ABILITY OF OUR FAMILIES TO PAY. HOPE FOR THE THINGS THAT THEY NEEDN'T ESPECIALLY HOUSE WERE IN THE MIDST OF SUMMER AND IT'S A HUNDRED DEGREES OUTSIDE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. UMPS FROM THEIR CONDITIONS ARE RUNNING PRETTY STRONG -- IS A SENATOR HUESO I BELIEVE -- EARLIER MENTIONED -- ASKING ASKING LOOKING FOR BAILOUTS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT REPAIRS HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR THE SYSTEM. I THAT THEY HAVE -- INVESTED MONEY IN CALIFORNIA HAVING A SAFE AND RELIABLE A RESILIENT LECTURES THIS ELECTRIC SYSTEM IF THE THAT REVENUE HASN'T BEEN USED IN THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. THAT BE AUDITED THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS NOT RATE PAYER FUNDS NOT BE USED. ABOUT TO BAIL OUT UTILITIES AS A RESULT. BUT HE'S ALSO AND I THINK WE'LL CLOSE WITH THIS IMPORTANT NOTE THAT -- CHOICES MUST BE MADE I THINK SO CANNELLA NOTED THIS EARLIER -- WE HAVE WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THINGS WERE ASKING UTILITIES TO DO A LOT OF THINGS RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING. FOR THOSE THINGS I WOULD NOTE IT'S NOT UTILITY MONEY IT'S REPAIR MONEY. SO WHAT ARE WE SPENDING THE MONEY ON ARE WE GETTING MORE PAYING. FOR AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT WE CANNOT DO EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED ARE UTILITIES AND CONSEQUENTLY A REPAIR FUNDS TO GO. FOR MAYBE WE NEED TO MAKE SOME CHOICES DIFFICULT CHOICES NONE THE LESS BUT I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER. THAT WE ARE IN A A CRITICAL NEW NORMAL. THAT MAYBE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS WE MADE IN THE PAST DESERVE RECONSIDERATION. IT'S NOT TO CALL OUT ANY SPECIFIC POLICY SIMPLY TO STATE THAT WE JUST CAN'T DO EVERYTHING. I THINK IS A MISTER SMARTY JONES SAWYER NOTED EARLIER. THERE'S NO MAGICAL POT OF MONEY OUT THERE UP FOR US TO DRAW FROM. THE CITY HAS BEEN DOING ALL I SEVERAL YEARS. UP FINANCIALLY BUT THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE FOREVER. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL POKER DORO ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS SOCIAIS XIN WE REPRESENT THE STATE'S FARMING AND FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LET ME START BY SAYING THAT I TOO AGREE WITH LUPUS RADIUS SPOKE ABOUT ON TUESDAY. AT THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT FIRE VICTIMS ARE MADE WHOLE AND HOPEFULLY EVERYONE CAN AGREE TO THAT. WHAT REALLY BECOMES A DIFFICULT TASK FOR ALL OF YOU IS HOW DO YOU DO THAT AND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE TO PAY FOR THAT IS THE MORE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES? YOU'VE HEARD SOME SUGGESTIONS FROM SOE OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE ALSO RATE PAYER ADVOCATES. UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T HEAR A LOT OF SOLUTIONS FROM THE FIRST PANEL TODAY -- A LOT OF EXCUSES A LOT OF POSITIONING IN BLAME POINTING AT PGA IN A THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT PGA NAY IT'S ABOUT THE RATE PAYERS AND UNFORTUNATELY. FOR A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS I THINK THEY'D BE PERFECTLY HAPPY IF RATE PAYERS WERE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG FOR ALL OF THESE COSTS. AND WE CAN'T BE AND WE SHOULDN'T BE. WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE WE DON'T MAKE DECISIONS AS RATEPAYERS UTILITIES MAKE THE DECISIONS ON WHAT GETS FUNDED? WE DON'T MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THE STATE MAKES THOSE DECISIONS. WE DON'T MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT LOCAL LAND USE PLANNING AND PUTTING HOMES IN HARM'S WAY. WE HAVE ZERO CONTROL OVER THESE THINGS THAT ARE DRIVING THE COSTS. WHICH BRINGS ME TO A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT I AGREE WE ARE FACING A NEW NORMAL THAT NEW NORMAL IS MORE COSTLY. AND LARGER WILDFIRES. I THINK IT GOES BEYOND CLIMATE POLICY HOWEVER IT GOES BACK TO WHAT I JUST STATED. SOME FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN LACKING MISTER DOLLY AND OTHERS AND MISSED MAYES AND OTHERS HAVE BROUGHT THAT UP REPEATEDLY WE AGREE WITH THAT STATE HAS SOME CULPABILITY HERE. SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE AND NEEDS TO BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION. LOCAL LAND USE PLAN. IS DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE ARE GETTING MORE COSTLY FIRES BECAUSE THERE ARE FRANKLY MANY MORE HOMES IN HARM'S WAY. PLAIN AND SIMPLE THOSE HARM THOSE HOMES ARE NOT IN HARM'S WAY THE COSTS WOULD NOT BE AS GREAT AS THEY ARE TODAY. BUT WE HAVE THE SITUATION WE HAVE AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS AND I THINK THAT'S THE RELEASED THE RULE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. SO LET ME TRY AND IN TURN -- TO A REAL IMPORTANT POINT FOR THOSE REASONS WE DO SUPPORT. OVERVIEW OF THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND A WAY TO BETTER BALANCE THE LIABILITY GOING FORWARD. WHETHER WE ADDRESS THAT. THIS YEAR WHICH WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE OR WE ADDRESS IT GOING FORWARD IT IS PART. OF A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION HAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED HOPEFULLY WE CAN AGREE ON A A FEW OTHER THINGS MOVING FORWARD SO WHAT'S A MORE BALANCED AND SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD NO AND AND ONE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS WERE NOT HERE PIMPIN FOR THE UTILITIES NOT BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION I'M ONE OF THE LEADING CRITICS OF UTILITIES IN THE STATE I'VE BEEN -- UTILITY RATE PAYER ADVOCATE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. I RARELY GET UP AND TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF PGA NAY BUT WE AGREE WITH THEM HERE THAT THIS LIABILITY ISSUE NEEDS TO BE REFORMED. AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- AND SO THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST THEY NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY'RE NEGLIGENT I DON'T THINK ANYONE DISAGREES WITH THAT I DON'T EVEN THINK P. JEANNIE WILL DISAGREE WITH THAT. THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN UTILITY RATE PAYERS WILL CONTINUE TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF COSTS OF HARDENING THE SYSTEM AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE ALL RECOGNIZE ITS RATEPAYERS WOULD ALL LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE WON'T BE INCREASES FOR RATEPAYERS THERE WILL BE. THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE HARDENED AND WILL THE UTILITIES MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS THE RATE PAYERS PAPER THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT THE UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS. SO WE'RE ON THE HOOK FOR THAT GOING FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THAT. INSURERS NEED TO STEP UP AND BE MORE RESPONSIBLE AGREE WITH MARK JOSEPH ON THOSE WHEN THE INEVITABLE STRIKES AFTER ALL THAT'S WHY WE ALL BY HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION GOING FORWARD. NOT THE ONLY PART BUT PART OF THAT SOLUTION GOING FORWARD. AND THEN LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE BEEN A LOT OF REPORTS ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS FROM THESE FIRES. OKAY SOME OF THOSE REPORTS SUGGEST THAT WE'RE GETTING MORE. CO TWO BEING RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT ON A DAILY BASIS. THAT IS BEING GENERATED BY THE ENTIRE ECONOMY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. THAT TELLS ME WE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING SOME OF THE GT R. F. DOLLARS I KNOW YOU SOME OF THAT. FOR FOR SOLVING SOME OF THIS PROBLEM WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THAT OVER THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE THE REDUCTIONS WE NEED. AND THE SAME IS TRUE THERE ALSO CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS PAID BY THE UTILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY RETURNED RATE PAYERS. THAT'S ANOTHER POT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE TAPPED TO HELP PAY FOR SOME OF THE HARDENING OF THE SYSTEM COSTS. MOVING FORWARD SO IN CONCLUSION WE LOOK FORWARD TO ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES WITH OTHERS TO FIND A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. IT ISN'T PUTTING IT ALL ON PGA NAY IT ISN'T PUTTING IT ALL ON RATE PAYERS IT ISN'T PUTTING IT ALL ON INSURERS. BUT WERE WILLING I THINK ITS RATEPAYERS TO COME TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF THE A COMMITTEE AND STAFF. TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT CAN WORK BUT IT CAN'T BE RATEPAYERS LEFT HOLDING THE BAG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU REPRIEVE YOUR COMMENTS SIR HUESO. THANK THEIR PRIMARILY I WANT TO DIRECT MY COMMENTS MISTER LONG BECAUSE YOU REPRESENT THE RATE PAYERS ARE PARTICULAR INTEREST IN WHAT YOU HAVE TO STAY YOUR PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT FACT INDIRECTLY RATE PERSONAL WE DO. SO -- I WANT TO KIND OF PUT THINGS A LITTLE BIT IN THE CONTEXT BECAUSE I WANT TO JUST MENTION THE FACT THAT THERE WAS. ADJOURNMENT FOR THE HERE THAT SPOKE THE FELT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE. WASN'T CAUSING MORE DAMAGE DESPITE THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE. MORE INTENSE FIRES WE HAVE. I'M MORE INTO ITS INTENSE DAMAGE WE HAVE AN INCIDENT IN SAN DIEGO IN WHICH HE I MEAN YOU MENTION AND EVERYBODY MENTIONS A NOBODY. HERE. WANTS TO ABSOLVE ANYBODY FOR THEIR NET NEGLIGENCE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DISCUSSES NEVER BEEN PROPOSED NOBODY HAS SAID WELL LET'S LOOK AT HOW WE CAN. HOLD -- UTILITIES LESS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM NOT MAKING THEIR IMPROVEMENTS OR THE FAILURE OF THEIR QUIT MEANT THAT THEY'RE LIABLE FOR NOBODY HAS SAID THAT NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT. THERE ISN'T A PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE THAT DOES THAT. LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE. BECAUSE WE DON'T I DON'T. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA DO THAT. AND IF THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE THEY'RE GONNA PAY THEY AGREE THEY WILL THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR POLICIES THAT. ABSOLVE THEM. SO LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT. I ADORED THE CONDITION IN WHICH AS IN SAN DIEGO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SAN DIEGO ON THE WAS A CONDITION WHICH SAN DIEGO DID MAKE THE UPGRADES. AND THEY DID MAINTAIN THEIR QUITMAN THEY DID NOTHING WRONG ENOUGH FRENCH CAME IN AND BLEW ADELINE. AND ANY TRIGGERED AN INVERSE CONDEMNATION CAN CLAIM AND IT IT RESULTED IN THIS DECISION WHICH APPEARS HE SAID NO REPAIRS WILL NOT PAY. YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS. THAT IS A DIRECT. THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT OF IT UNLESS YOU NEED BASICALLY ACTING AS AN INSURANCE COMPANIES SAYING OKAY WE'RE GONNA PAY THIS BECAUSE THOSE DAMAGES WERE PAID BY INSURANCE COMPANIES INSURANCE COMPANY SUED. S. THE GENIE AND THEY WORK ALL THE FUNDS THAT THEY SUIT FOR RECOVERY. SO DO YOU BELIEVE OUR UTILITY SHOULD BE AT AN INSURANCE. ACT AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. FOR LOSSES IN THE STATE. SENATOR AS I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION YEAR YOUR SUGGESTING THAT TOM. BUT SRI FLEW IN THAT WASN'T WITHIN THAT RIGHT OF WAY. THAT. TOM FLEW INTO A LINE THAT STARTED THE FIRE IT IS ONE OF THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ESTA JEANNIE CONTEXT WHAT HAPPENED WAS TREES THAT THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRIMMING THAT WERE RIGHT NEXT TO THEIR LINES. WERE NOT PACKED PROPERLY TRIMMED AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO THE DETAILS. BECAUSE I CAN GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THE CASE A LITTLE BIT MORE KNOW THAT THEY WERE CUT IN THE WAS A TREE THAT [inaudible] WAS WILL. FAR FROM THE LINES IT WAS WEAKENED BECAUSE OF THAT CUTTING AND GET SO I MEAN. WE'RE GETTING INTO YOU KNOW THE DETAILS BUT GENERALLY -- ASSUMING. THAT IT WAS. I MEAN WAIT IT'S HARDER TO LITIGATE THIS FROM HERE BUT GENERALLY. IF YOU THINK CURRENTLY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT'S OF THAT THAT THEY SHOULD BE UTILITIES ARE NOT ACTIVE ISSUES INSURANCE NO MIGHT MY VIEW IS THAT TIME WHEN UTILITIES ARE NEGLIGENT AND WOOD YOU YOU ADDRESS THAT YOU SAID THERE'S NO NO NO WORRY THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN I'VE I'VE I I HOPE THAT THAT'S THE CASE. I I HAVE SEEN BILLS WHAT IF THEY'RE NOT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IN S. B. THIRTY THREE FOR A THIRD. EIGHT THIRTY THREE THAT WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BUT THAT PUTTING THAT ASIDE. TICKETS ARE CONCERNED THAT -- YOU RAISE I THINK IS THAT THE UTILITIES WOULD BE HELD SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. WHEN THEY'RE NOT NEGLIGENT AND WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE YOU PINCH THE UTILITY SHOULD BECOME THE INSURERS OF LAST RESORTNOR SHOULD REPAIRS BECAUSE I HAVE THE WOMEN DECISION HERE AND THE WE MET DECISION? IN IT [inaudible] BUT DENIED THAT REPAIRS SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE OTHER WORDS UP UPHELD THAT REPAIRS SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. AND THAT SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD PAY THOSE DAMAGES. BUT ALSO IN THE SAME DECISION THEY SAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING. TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION THAT PUTS YOU SEE IN THE POSITION TO HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT'S INHERENT IN OUR EITHER LAW OR IN THEIR OPINION THAT IT NEEDS LEGISLATIVE ACTION FOR THAT NOT HAPPEN SO. YOUR ANSWER IS YOU DON'T BELIEVE THEY SHOULD ACT AS INSURANCE COMPANIES AS A P. YOU SEE FEELS THAT THEY ARE UP WHY DON'T AGREE THAT THAT'S THE P. UC'S VIEW BUT I DO AGREE THAT I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S IN THE DOCUMENT IT'S AT THAT IN THE REPORT. BUT I REQUEST AS I READ. FOUND IS THAT THE THE COMPANY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH PRUDENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND AS A RESULT IT WAS IMPRUDENT AND THAT RATEPAYERS. SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE UTILITIES IMPRUDENCE AND THAT WAS WHAT THAT DECISION SAID. AN I DO READ THE PARK WHERE HE WHEN THERE WAS A CONCURRENCE BY TWO THE COMMISSIONERS. TO WITHOUT I KNOW MEASURES LECTURED OF CHANGE CHINA A WITH TODAY THEIR OPINION WAS WHICH I HAPPEN NOT TO AGREE WITH WAS THAT THE THAT THICKENS THE PRUDENT STANDARD DOES NOT GIVE THE COMMISSION. THE FLEXIBILITY WOULD LIKE TO APPORTION RESPONSIBILITY AND I JUST DON'T I DON'T READ IT I DON'T VIEW THE PRINCETON OF THAT WAY I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS. I'VE SEEN CASES WHERE THE COMMISSION HAS IN FACT A PORTION FOR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY EVEN WHEN UTILITY WAS FOUND IN PRUDENT. ANDIN MY NEXT QUESTION FOLLOWING UP ON THAT IF. IF IT'S THE P. YOU SEE THAT GIVES AN HOUR AND MINUTES OF DIFFERENT P. YOU SEE. WHAT MONTH MOSTLY GOVERNS THE? THE D. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WHICH PRETTY MUCH MANAGE NINETY PART OF THE PROVIDING UTILITY AND WHAT'S 90% OF THE STATE WHICH IS THE NAME OF THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST LIABILITIES BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE. A SERVICE IN THE FORCE THAT AREAS AND THERE'S FOREST'S. THAT THAT ARE MAINLY IT'S OPEN SPACE AREAS THAT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE BIGGEST -- LIKELIHOOD OF FOR THESE INCIDENTS TAKE PLACE AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THE THIRD THE FIRES HAVE BEEN IGNITED. OUT THERE IN THE IN THE FORCE SO. BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU ON THIS IS [inaudible] IF. THE OTHER RESPONSES. CLIMATE CHANGE YOU BELIEVE CLIMATE CHNGE IS PUT IN THE EXTRA BURDEN ON THE WAY WE AND YOU ENGINEER OUR OUR ELECTRICAL GRID. ABSOLUTELY. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN IT TO JUST FOR CLIMATE CHANGE I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE UTILITIES ARE NOW DOING AND FIND WAYS TO DO A BETTER JOB I THINK PJ NEEDS TO BE THE FOCUSED START BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE HAVING. THE PROBLEMS DO YOU BELIEVE REPAIR SHOULD PAY FOR THAT. WHEN IT'S SHOWN TO BE A GOOD YOU SURVEY PARA MONEY ABSOLUTELY IN THE PAST WHEN IT HAS BEEN ARGUED? THAT THOSE UPGRADE SHOULD BE MADE. THERE THERE'VE BEEN SOME CASES IN WHICH IF YOU SEE HAS NOT. ALLOWED THOSE UPGRADES BECAUSE OF THE PASSING OF THE CONCERN OF PASS ENORMOUS COSTS TO THE RATE PAYERS ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT. WELL I I I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT HAVE HAD THAT BEEN EVER EVER HAPPENING WHETHER. THEY'VE BEEN REQUEST TO STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM THAT THEY'VE BEEN DENIED. BY THE PC I ACTUALLY DON'T SEE THAT WHAT WHAT I SEE IS WITH UTILITY SAYING I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF FEW YEARS BACK PGE WAS HAVING A BIG PROBLEM WITH RELY. BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM. TO UPGRADE THEIR OF THE RELIABILITY I HATE WHEN USE PJ AND HE HAS A AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE I MEAN HONESTLY I I CAN DEFEND ANYTHING THEY DO YOU KNOW BUT THERE ARE OTHER UTILITIES IN THE STATE I HOPE. YOU COULD USE THEM ANYWAY AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE POINT I WAS GETTING TO IS THAT. UTILITIES SOMETIMES OVER REACH IN THERE SPENDING PROGRAMS AND THEY THEY THEY WANT TO DO MOR THAN IS A GOOD USE OF RAPE PARA MONEY. THEY'VE GOT TO BE FINDING WAYS TO TO DO THE RIGHT THING TO ADDRESS THE RIGHT PROBLEMS. WITH A PROPERLY MEASURED IN SCOPE PROGRAM AND WHO WOULD DETERMINE THAT AND THAT'S THE JOB OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WITH THE INPUT OF INTERVENE IS LIKE TURN AND THE OTHER AND GREAT PAIR ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE. SITTING WITH ME TODAY AND THE OFFICE OF REPAIR ADVOCATES THROUGH A PROCESS WHERE EVERYBODY GETS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND FOR THEIR VOICE TO BE HEARD. OKAY AT THAT OUT OF CAPITA OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. ITS INTERESTING THAT FOR ALL THREE OF YOU THAT. JUST A STATEMENT THAT -- YA MICHAEL PICKER SAPPY FORCE FROM THE P. YOU SEE LAST WEEK ARE. SEEMS LIKE LAST WEEK ALREADY DOESN'T -- TUESDAY. AND OPINED THAT -- THAT THE EXPENSES THAT THE UTILITIES IN GENERAL WERE -- WERE SPENDING -- FOR MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADE OF THEIR SYSTEMS ARE BEING SPENT FOR THAT SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO HEAR. YES YES SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS -- BUT SUBSIST SPECIFICALLY COMMENT FOR MISTER LONG YOU SAID THAT -- SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. LIKE CLINTON EIGHTY EIGHT MY BILL -- WHAT IS GOOD ENOUGH OF SUSPECTS SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH WHAT SHOULD THE STANDARD BE? THE STANDARD SHOULD BE WHAT WOULD A PRUDENT MANAGER DO IN THE SITUATION GIVEN THE FACTS NOT THE TIME AND THAT'S THE P. YOU SEE STANDARD THAT IT APPLIED AND YES TO JEANNIE CASE THAT THAT'S BEEN APPLIED BY. STATE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR SINCE THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY BUT I I WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT'S SEMANTICS BUT THAT YOUR POINT -- THE CONCERN ABOUT S. B.. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT SIR IS THAT IS THAT THE UTILITIES TRAFFIC PLAN AND THERE'S A VERY RUSHED PROCESS FOR THE PLANNED TO BE APPROVED. AND AND THEN THE PROBLEM IS THAT. UTILITIES CAN SAY WE SUBSTANTIALLY WHAT WE DID WE KIND OF WEEK WEEKS WE COMPLY WITH A LOT OF IT BUT WE DIDN'T DO AT ALL AND SO THEREFORE. WOULD INTRANET TREE. YOU KNOW OF THAT WAS THAT. TRUE MOST OF THEM. AND AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S A GOOD LOOK AT ME LOOK AT WHAT I CAN GET INTO SPECIFICS BUT IF NAY IF THERE'S NEGLIGENCE -- THE UTILITY PAYS. YEAH WE CANNOT GET DOWN TO THE MICRO. YOU KNOW -- PORTIONS OF ALL THESE -- YOU KNOW. RURAL AREAS ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS TREE IN THAT TREE THAT'S A CPU SEES RESPONSIBILITY. AND AND I WOULD ARGUE WITH YOU ALSO THAT -- IT HAVING IT -- NOT INVOLVED IN THE GENERAL CASE RATE CASE. IS A BETTER WAY. OF GETTING TO SAFETY AND I GET THE FACT THAT I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU ALL OF YOU FOR BEING PIERCE ADVOCATES FOR RATEPAYERS I THINK WERE ALL. FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR REPAIRS TO PSYCH I I REALLY COMMEND YOU AND THANK YOU BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. YOU GET IN A GENERAL RATE CASE NOBODY'S REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND I SHOULD SAY THAT LIKE THAT LET ME LET ME BACK OFF THAT NOBODY. IT TENDS TO TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE THE FOCUS. IT'S NOT ON SAFETY SO WHEN YOU HAVE A GENERAL WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE A A SEPARATE RATE CASE FOR SAFETY ONLY [inaudible] WHICH IS. UP PART OF THE TEN EIGHTY EIGHT BILL THERE'S MORE TIME AND ATTENTION PAID TO SAFETY. AND THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SAFETY AND GIVES YOU ALL THE OPPORTUNITY. TO OPINE ON WHAT IS GOOD WITH THAT AND WHAT IS BAD AS OPPOSED. TO THE LATTER WHICH IS EVERYTHING THROWN IN -- BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AND LORD KNOWS WHAT'S THE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN A MINUTE TO LET YOU TALK OF JUST WILL. ONE SECOND THE FINISHED BY SAYING. I THINK THAT CPC HAS GOT A HORRIBLE JOB. ON SAFETY AND OVER IN REGULATING SAFETY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT WE BLAME P. JEANNIE AND THEY DESERVE A LOT OF BLAME BUT THE CPUC OVERSIGHT OF P. JEANNIE IT EVERY SINGLE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY IS LACKS. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE WE HEARD IT THE OTHER DAY THEY SAID SO DAMN MUCH BUT THE SAID SO LITTLE. AND THAT'S WHAT I PICKED UP FROM DAMAGE TO YOUR POINT I AND I'M NOT GONNA AND CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO DISAGREE WITH YOU CENTER DOT ON ON THAT POINT ABOUT EXPEDITING THIS PROCESS -- YOU KNOW WHEN THERE IS A SAFETY SITUATION I GUARANTEE SAFETY WILL BE FRONT AND CENTER IMPEACHING THESE NEXT SEVERAL RATE CASE WHETHER WE SEPARATED ARE NOT THE SAME HAPPENED WITH P. GINNY'S GENERATE CASE RIGHT AFTER -- THE SAME BRUNO INCIDENT THAT. ENTIRELY ON SAFETY WE SOUGHT WITH LISA CANYON AND IN SO CAL GASES RATE CASE FOLLOWING LISA CANYON THEY'RE ASKING FOR A MASSIVE RATE INCREASE TO ADDRESS. SAFETY FOR LISA CANYON SO IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY CAN WE IMPROVE IT SURE. AND CAN WE WORK WITH YOU TO FIND A YOU KNOW A WAY TO DO THAT SURE ABSOLUTELY WE CAN YOU KNOW WE CAN IMPROVE ON THE PROCESS AT THE CPUC. THIS STUFF DOES NEED TO GET DONE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE IS A PERVERSEINCENTIVE FOR UTILITIES TO OVERSPEND PARTICULARLY ON CAPITAL PROJECTS. THE MORE THEY SPEND THE MORE SHAREHOLDERS MAKE AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT INVERSE. AGREE PURSE BUT IT'S JUST IT INVERSE I'M SORRY PERVERSE. I'VE SAID IN VERSE SO MANY TIMES IN THE LAST FEW EXCEPT PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO OVERSPEND SO THAT IS WHY I THINK IT'S RATE PAYERS WE INSIST ON HAVING A PROCESS. TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE TIME TO LOOK THROUGH THAT WERE OUT ROUTE NUMBER. I CAN GET ON A CALL ON A RATE CASE WITH PGA NAY WITHOUT YOU KNOW ME AND EIGHT OF THEIR ATTORNEYS ON THE OTHER. END OF THE PHONE BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST THEY LAWYER UP AND THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST MUCH MORE PREPARED. SO WE'RE ALWAYS AT A DISADVANTAGE IS RATEPAYERS IN THAT PROCEEDING SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS STUFF. IS PRUDENT IS NECESSARY AND ISN'T JUST YOU KNOW THE UTILITIES PATTING SHAREHOLDER PROFITS AND SO THERE'S A WAITED TO FIGURE THAT OUT WITH YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I'M IF I MIGHT ADD TO THAT INCREASE WITH MS FROM MR BROKEN DORIS SAID REGARDING -- YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHICH SAFETY IS NOT FRONT AND CENTER. IN ALL THE UPCOMING GENERATE CASES. AT THE TIES IN WITH MISTER -- WAIT THE SENATE RACES QUESTION REGARDING DOESN'T THAT YOU CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE IMPACT HERE I THINK WE CAN'T THAT STATE THIS DIFFICULT TO DENY -- YET THE THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE ISSUES SUCH AS THE STATE RESOURCES AND GIGI R. F. FOR SOME OTHER YOU KNOW ENTITY SENATOR -- HUESO COULD PLAY A ROLE. YOU KNOW IN THAT DODD DISCUSSION BECAUSE THERE IS THAT STATE BUT INTEREST IN PREVENTING THE RELEASE OF CARBON. EMISSIONS IN THERE IS AT SEA INTEREST IN THE FORESTRY POLICIES THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN THERE IS A STATE INTEREST IN PROTECTING. OUR THE LIVES OF THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE I THINK THERE IS THAT NEXUS THERE AND IT YOU KNOW THE NEW NORMAL YOU KNOW CERTAINLY CALLS FOR A RE EVALUATION OF OF HOW THOSE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN INVESTED TODAY. BUT TO CENTER ON CHAIR MISTER CHAIRMAN'S QUESTION. WELL I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE SIR I THINK OUR ISSUE. YOU KNOW WITH TEN EIGHTY EIGHT NOT TO RELITIGATE THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT WHAT WAS SIMPLY THAT THE PROCESS WAS WE FELT NOT BALANCED IN THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE SO [inaudible] I THINK. WE CAN WE CAN CERTAINLY IMPROVE OUR BEYOND WHERE WE ARE TODAY OR WE HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY. THANK YOU. US SEEM NO OTHER QUESTIONS WHO. EXCUSE YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. I WILL NOW TURN THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION OVER TO SENATOR DOG. OKAY -- ABILITY WITH THE CENTER IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN THAT HOW MANY PEOPLE OR PLANNING ON THAT'S OKAY. NOW HOLD YOUR RIGHT HEADS UP DO YOU REMEMBER. IT'S ALWAYS WHERE THE YOU KNOW THE RULES. ALRIGHT LET'S DO THIS. FIXTURES CO CHAIR AND MEMBERS CREEK COOK REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY FIRST. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK AND COMMEND THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE TRANSPARENCY OF THIS PROCESS. WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU AS THIS PROCESS DEVELOPS. IT'S EPA CONSIST OF SIXTEEN SOME ARE OWNED LOCAL PUBLICLY PUBLICLY ELECTRIC UTILITIES PART ELECTED BOARDS DEMAND THAT WE OPERATE NAY SAFE AND RELIABLE MANNER. OUR CUSTOMERS EXPECT TO PAY FOR THAT. WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED A OF OF A PROPOSAL THAT WAS BEFORE YOU TODAY. BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT. A FEW OF NUMBER OF OUR MEMBERS BORDER ON FORCE LANDS TWO OF THOSE READING AND SHASTA CITY YOU'VE BEEN READING ABOUT MOST RECENTLY. WE HAVE OUR HYDRO FACILITY PLAN AND OUR GEOTHERMAL PLANT THAT ARE LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF FOREST LAND WE STRONGLY URGES COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO DROP AN AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM. OF FORCE MANAGEMENT I THINK WE'LL ALL WIN THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT BIGGER. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DENNIS NEIL JONES AND SINCE AUGUST I'M SORRY SINCE DECEMBER FOURTH I'VE BEEN PROVIDING PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICES TO HUNDREDS OF THOMAS FIRE VICTIMS. AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE TRENCHES THAT ALL IS NOT WELL IN THE INSURANCE RECOVERY AREA. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW MOST HOMEOWNERS ARE UNDER INSURED FOR COVERAGE A IN ADDITION SOME LENDERS ARE NOT ALLOWING THEIR CUSTOMERS TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES. ONCE THEY RECEIVE TOTAL LOSS SETTLEMENTS FROM THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY. INSTEAD THEY'RE REQUIRING THAT THOSE INSURANCE SETTLEMENTS BE APPLIED TO THE LOAN BALANCE LEAVING THE HOMEOWNERS UNABLE TO REBUILD. MANY HAVE GIVEN UP AND SO AS A RESULT. OF LOTS FOR SALE IN VENTURA. FROM PEOPLE THAT CANNOT HAVE HAVE MADE THE DECISION THAT THEY CANNOT REBUILD. STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD IN INVERSE CONDEMNATION CASES RECOGNIZES THE FACT THAT PROVIDING ELECTRICITY IS A HAZARDOUS ACTIVITY. IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THE INHERENT DISPARITY IN POWER BETWEEN THE CONSUMER. AND BETWEEN A GOVERNMENTAL SPONSORED UTILITY THANK YOU WRAP UP REAL QUICK YES. UP THIS BILL IS IMPOSING A BALANCING ACT THAT WILL STACK THE DECK IN FAVOR OF UTILITIES HOW MANY HOUSES MAKE YOU LEARN IN ORDER THANK YOU. THANK. FOR EVERYBODY'S EDIFICATION THERE IS NO BILL YET WERE DISAPPEARING WERE LEARNING THEIR WILL BE SET AT SOME POINT TIME. NEXT WEEK MR JOB MISTER HOLDEN AND MEMBERS I'M GARY PASSED MORE THE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS IN GRATEFUL FOR YOUR UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. WELL ANY PROPOSAL WITH THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ELECTRIC RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE DRAWS OUR ATTENTION AND THAT'S BECAUSE SO MANY SENIORS LIVE ON FIXED INCOMES THAT HAVE VERY LITTLE FLEXIBILITY. TO AFFORD UTILITY INCREASES. WE ASK FOR CHANGE IN THE LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS I MEAN PROPOSED. PAUL ON THE ISSUE OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION BECAUSE WITHOUT IT. BOB ARE HIGHER UTILITY BILLS WILL CERTAINLY FACE SENIORS ON FIXED INCOMES. WITHOUT REFORMS UTILITIES WILL BE SUBJECTED TO HIGHER FINANCING COSTS INCREASED INSURANCE PREMIUMS. AND IT WILL BE AT THE COST OF ALTERNATELY BE PASSED ALONG TO CUSTOMERS WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE APPLICATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION. IS INHERENTLY FLAWED. VISITORS ZOOMS THE DAMAGE COSTS SHOULD BE SOCIALIZED AMONG CUSTOMERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP NEXT SPEAKER CAN YOU HOLD FOR SECOND DAVID WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO NOW. S.
