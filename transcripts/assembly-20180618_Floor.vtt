01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.499
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION.

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:19.334
IN THE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.868
FROM THEIR PARENTS WHEN THEY

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:21.703
COME TO THE U. S. SEEKING

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:22.003
[inaudible]

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:25.573
REFUGE SEEKING ASYLUM.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.442
THE REFUGEE CRISIS DOES NOT

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:29.544
EXIST OUTSIDE OF THESE BORDERS.

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:30.745
IN IS NOT ONLY SOMETHING THAT

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:31.879
HAPPENS IN OTHER PLACES ALL OVER

01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:33.414
THE WORLD.

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:35.617
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT HERE.

01:27:35.683 --> 01:27:37.552
FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN CRISIS

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:39.554
WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:40.188
SINGLE DAY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:43.291
SEA. TO OVER TWO THOUSAND

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:44.058
CHILDREN.

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:44.993
THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM

01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:47.895
THEIR PARENTS RIGHT NOW.

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:48.529
BECAUSE OF OUR ADMINISTRATION'S

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:50.598
POLICIES.

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:52.033
THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO WERE

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.469
LIVING IN CAGES WHO ARE REFUGEES

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:56.537
TO THIS NATION.

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:57.772
WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:58.072
[inaudible]

01:27:58.139 --> 01:28:00.642
COUNSEL FOR SOLD WHO HAVE BEEN

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.343
SEPARATED FROM THE ONLY FAMILY

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:04.445
THAT THEY'VE EVER KNOWN.

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:05.446
THIS IS A REFUGEE [inaudible]

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:07.615
DAY.

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:10.985
IN WE HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS.

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:13.921
AND HOW WE RESPOND AS AMERICANS.

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:16.024
HOW WE RESPOND AS THIS

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:17.892
LEGISLATIVE BODY?

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:20.895
SAYS A LOT ABOUT OUR VALUES.

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:22.463
I'M SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:24.298
AND I THINK ALL OF US SHOULD.

01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:25.700
BECAUSE THIS IS AN INTOLERABLE

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:27.769
PRACTICE.

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:29.070
SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:31.639
PARENTS IS NOT ONLY CRUEL BUT IS

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:33.775
INHUMANE.

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:35.843
IT IS AN ABUSE TO CHILDREN.

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.111
IT IS ALSO ACCORDING TO THE

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:38.846
UNITED NATIONS.

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:41.616
A SEVERE VIOLATION TO CHILDREN'S

01:28:41.683 --> 01:28:44.485
RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:46.187
FAMILIES ARE SEEKING ASYLUM FROM

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:47.188
COUNTRIES THAT ARE WORN TORN AND

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:49.123
FILLED WITH VIOLENCE.

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:51.059
WE MUST TAKE THE STEPS NECESSARY

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:52.427
TO ENSURE THAT OUR BROTHERS AND

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.861
SISTERS WHO ARE LEFT WITH NO

01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:57.465
CHOICE BUT TO RISK THEIR LIVES.

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:57.932
IN SEARCH OF A BETTER

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:58.433
OPPORTUNITY [inaudible]

01:28:58.499 --> 01:28:59.867
HOW THAT?

01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:01.836
IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:03.538

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:07.909
I MYSELF.

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:09.811
I'M AN UNRECOGNIZED REFUGEE FROM

01:29:09.877 --> 01:29:10.411
A COUNTRY FILLED WITH VIOLENCE

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:12.013

THE AGE OF FIVE WERE LIVING IN

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:25.626
CAGES AT THIS MOMENT.

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:28.062
IT IS NOT A FOREIGN CONCEPT.

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:29.197

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:43.010

TODAY.

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:23.484
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:25.787
TO REMIND FOLKS THAT WHAT IS

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:26.888
HAPPENING AT OUR BORDERS.

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:28.322

PRESENT THEMSELVES FOR ASYLUM

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:38.032
THAT IS A LEGAL IMMIGRATION.

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:40.034
THAT IS WHAT OUR LAW ALLOWS THEM

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:41.936
TO COME WITH THEIR FAMILY AND

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:44.172
PRESENT THEMSELVES INTO ARGUE

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:45.673
FOR REFUGEE STATUS IT'S

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.542
HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY AND AS

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:48.976
THEY DO WITH THEIR CHILDREN ARE

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:50.645
BEING RIPPED FROM THEM.

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:53.447
AND BEING PUT IN CAGES.

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:54.949
AND THE PEOPLE REPEAT.

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:56.651
THESE CHILDREN AWAY ARE NOT

01:30:56.717 --> 01:30:58.820
ALLOWED TO EVEN HUG THEM WHEN

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:00.988
THEY'RE CRYING CAN YOU IMAGINE

01:31:01.055 --> 01:31:03.124
IN AN INSTITUTION TWO YEAR OLD

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:05.193
CHILDREN CRYING THEMSELVES TO

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:07.028
SLEEP WITHOUT EVEN BEING HUGGED

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:07.628
BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT MEDICAL

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:09.030
PROFESSIONALS.

01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:10.765
THIS IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:12.333
TODAY.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.569
IT IS NOT A LAW THAT WAS PASSED

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:15.970
THIS IS A NEW.

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:18.472
IT IS WRONG IN ON WORLD REFUGEE

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:20.107

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:21.776
OUTRAGE.

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:24.312
ABOUT THE WAY THAT OUR COUNTRY

01:31:24.378 --> 01:31:25.880
IS TREATING FAMILIES AND

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:27.148
CHILDREN.

01:31:27.215 --> 01:31:29.317
BUT SPECIFICALLY.

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.218
BECAUSE I NEVER WANT TO JUST

01:31:30.284 --> 01:31:32.019
HEAR SOMEBODY BROKE THE LAW I

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:33.321
THINK THAT'S IT.

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:35.656
IRRELEVANT DISCUSSION ANYWAY BUT

01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:36.524
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.659
REFUGEES IN THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:41.195
THEY DIDN'T BREAK THE LAW.

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.830
THE IN FACT WINS BY OUR

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:44.665
IMMIGRATION LAWS THEY ARE LEGAL

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:46.634
IMMIGRANTS AND TOLD THEY ARE

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:49.203
DEFINED AS REFUGEES ARE NOT.

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:50.371
JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:51.973
TODAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO BETTER

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:53.407

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:20.795
RIGHTS VIOLATION.

01:33:20.861 --> 01:33:22.330

OVER TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN HAVE

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:05.006
BEEN TAKEN FROM THEIR PARENTS.

01:34:05.072 --> 01:34:06.841
AS A CROSS IN THIS COUNTRY.

EVEN SITUATIONS SOMETIMES FROM

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:18.819
ABUSE SOMETIMES NEGLECT WE DO

FAMILIES TOGETHER BECAUSE WE

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:22.890

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:24.658

THAT WE SEE.

01:34:31.732 --> 01:34:34.301
THE ANATHEMA OF THOSE POLICIES

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:36.704
BEING ENACTED AT OUR BORDERS.

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:38.172

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:39.607
OUR VOICES.

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:40.841

THIS POLICY IS ABSOLUTELY

01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:23.884
HORRENDOUS.

01:35:23.951 --> 01:35:26.420
IT IS SOMETHING THAT FOR MANY

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:28.389
MANY DECADES THESE FAMILIES WILL

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:31.158
LIVE WITH WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:33.294
THE LOVE OF A PARENT AND NOT

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.829
EVEN KNOWING WHERE YOUR CHILD

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:36.197

WHICH HOME THERE AT WHEN THEY

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:42.069
DAMAGE THAT WILL BE VERY

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:44.238
DIFFICULT TO REPAIR AND THIS

TWO YEARS AGO.

01:39:27.027 --> 01:39:29.296
I GAVE A RESOLUTION TO A WOMAN

01:39:29.363 --> 01:39:30.564
OF THE YEAR AND I SPOKE ABOUT IT

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:32.433
ON THIS FOOR.

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:35.235
SHE WAS A REFUGEE FROM CAMBODIA.

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:37.471
WHO CAME HERE AFTER BARELY

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:39.707

01:39:44.578 --> 01:39:45.846

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:47.314
CELEBRATED MEMBERS OF OUR

01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:48.949

COUNTRY SHE WANTED TO COME HERE.

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.692
AND WE HAVE A PROCESS THROUGH

WHICH FOLKS CAN DO THAT.

01:40:01.028 --> 01:40:02.363
I WISH IT WERE EVEN MORE OPEN.

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:04.298
BUT NOBODY SHOULD SAY THAT IF

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:06.100
YOU WERE A APPARENT REVIEW

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.634

GET TO THIS COUNTRY.

01:40:11.438 --> 01:40:12.940
AND WE SHOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE

01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:14.708
FOR THEM TO COME AND SUCCEED AND

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:16.410
BECOME PART OF AMERICA.

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:17.244
AND THEY ALL SPEAK DIFFERENT

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.679
LANGUAGES.

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:20.180
BUT THEY SPEAK A UNIFYING

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:21.648
LANGUAGE THAT WE ALL KNOW AND

01:40:21.715 --> 01:40:24.518
THAT IS A YEARNING FOR FREEDOM

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:26.320
[inaudible] FOR OPPORTUNITY.

SOME OF THE CONDITIONS --

01:52:26.339 --> 01:52:27.507
THAT SOME OF THEIR CHILDREN HAVE

THERE IS ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND

01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:38.251
CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEES --

WELCOME BUYER PRESIDENT AT THAT

01:52:42.222 --> 01:52:44.958
TIME IN FACT I THINK WE HAD A?

01:52:45.024 --> 01:52:47.494
DELEGATION OF LATINO LEGISLATORS

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.295

01:52:49.929 --> 01:52:51.598
CONCLUSION THAT THEY WERE

01:52:51.664 --> 01:52:53.399
SATISFIED WITH THE CONDITIONS

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:54.968

01:52:59.439 --> 01:53:00.440

THAT THOSE CHILDREN ARE LIVING

01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:08.181
AND SO I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

01:53:08.248 --> 01:53:09.215
THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

01:53:09.282 --> 01:53:11.017
DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THAT AMERICA

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:11.951

WITH MY KIDS.

02:28:18.456 --> 02:28:19.957
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CHILDREN

02:28:20.024 --> 02:28:20.558
WITH INVOLVED FATHERS ARE ARE

02:28:20.625 --> 02:28:23.294
BETTER EQUIPPED. FOR THE

02:28:23.361 --> 02:28:24.462
INEVITABLE CHALLENGES OF LIFE

02:28:24.528 --> 02:28:26.831
THEY PERFORM BETTER AT SCHOOL.

02:28:26.897 --> 02:28:27.765

02:28:27.832 --> 02:28:29.233
POVERTY OR FACE FOOD INSECURITY.

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:30.334

02:28:30.401 --> 02:28:33.304
CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION.

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:49.153
AND THE WAR ON DRUGS.

02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:50.087
HAD THE EFFECT OF REMOVING MANY

02:28:50.154 --> 02:28:51.355
FATHERS.

02:28:51.422 --> 02:28:55.559

IN ALL OF HIS MIGHT.

02:33:26.363 --> 02:33:27.364
AND ALL OF HIS DREAMS AND ALL OF

02:33:27.431 --> 02:33:29.867

02:33:33.771 --> 02:33:37.041
AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN.

WE'RE NOT FAMOUS MEN.

02:33:40.244 --> 02:33:41.579
WOULD NOT NOTABLE MEN WOULD NOT

02:33:41.645 --> 02:33:43.914
LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHO

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:46.083
NOT PASTORS OF CHURCHES.

02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:47.084
WHO REALLY MAKE ENORMOUS

02:33:47.151 --> 02:33:48.552
SACRIFICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN?

02:33:48.619 --> 02:33:49.453
AND IT'S KIND OF AMAZING BECAUSE

02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:50.087
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

02:33:50.154 --> 02:33:50.955
THIS COUNTRY.

02:33:51.021 --> 02:33:51.989
AND HOW THIS COUNTRY HAS TREATED

02:33:52.056 --> 02:33:53.424
AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES

02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:53.958
HISTORICALLY FOR OVER TWO

02:33:54.024 --> 02:33:55.159
HUNDRED YEARS.

02:33:55.225 --> 02:33:56.026
WHAT WE SEPARATED THE MEN FROM

02:33:56.093 --> 02:33:56.660
THEIR CHILDREN AND FROM THEIR

02:33:56.727 --> 02:33:59.330
WIVES AND WE HAD BREEDING FARMS

02:33:59.396 --> 02:34:00.364
WE LITERALLY BREED OF THESE MEN

02:34:00.431 --> 02:34:01.865
AND USE THEM ONLY TO CREATE MORE

02:34:01.932 --> 02:34:04.068
SLAVES?

02:34:04.134 --> 02:34:06.003
AND YET AT THE END OF SLAVERY WE

02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.770
FIND THAT THE ONE THING THEY

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:08.505
SOUGHT MOST OFTEN WAS TO FIND

02:34:08.572 --> 02:34:10.174
THEIR FAMILIES.

02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:11.208
AND IF THEY DIDN'T WAS TO

02:34:11.275 --> 02:34:13.210
ESTABLISH A FAMILY.

02:34:13.277 --> 02:34:13.844
AND TO BELIEVE IN THAT FAMILY

02:34:13.911 --> 02:34:14.678
AND TO GIVE ALL THEY COULD EVEN

02:34:14.745 --> 02:34:16.080
IN THE FACE OF THE CHALLENGES

02:34:16.146 --> 02:34:17.014
THAT THEY MET IN AMERICA. TO BE

02:34:17.081 --> 02:34:20.050
FATHERS.

02:34:20.117 --> 02:34:22.753
MY DAD WAS A GREAT MAN.

02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:23.887
NOT REALLY EDUCATED DIDN'T HAVE

02:34:23.954 --> 02:34:25.756
A LOT OF MONEY.

02:34:25.823 --> 02:34:27.391
BUT HE LOVED HIS EIGHT CHILDREN.

02:34:27.458 --> 02:34:29.727
WITH ALL OF HIS HEART.

02:34:29.793 --> 02:34:30.961
HE HAD ONE SUIT THAT HE WORE

02:34:31.028 --> 02:34:32.730
BECAUSE HE WAS A MASON.

02:34:32.796 --> 02:34:34.064
AND HE HAD ONE GOOD BLACK SUIT

02:34:34.131 --> 02:34:37.234
AND A PAIR OF STACY ADAMS SHOES

02:34:37.301 --> 02:34:40.104
THAT LASTED FOR TWENTY YEARS

02:34:40.170 --> 02:34:44.408
THAT HE WORE TO MAJOR EVENTS.

02:34:44.475 --> 02:34:47.444
NOT BECAUSE UPON HIS DEATH HE

02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:49.380
HAD LOTS OF SUITS BECAUSE EIGHT

02:34:49.446 --> 02:34:50.681
CHILDREN MADE SURE THAT HE THEY

02:34:50.748 --> 02:34:51.749
THAT WE BOUGHT HIM EVERYTHING WE

02:34:51.815 --> 02:34:54.752
THOUGHT HE WON IT.

02:34:54.818 --> 02:34:56.520
BUT HE NEVER LET US EVER BE

02:34:56.587 --> 02:34:59.023
DISAPPOINTED IN LIFE.

02:34:59.089 --> 02:34:59.623
WE ALWAYS KNEW WHERE WE WERE

02:34:59.690 --> 02:35:05.429
GOING TO SLEEP.

02:35:05.496 --> 02:35:05.863
WE'RE GOING TO EAT.

02:35:05.929 --> 02:35:07.131
WE'RE ALWAYS COMFORTABLE.

02:35:07.197 --> 02:35:08.532
AND WE KNEW THAT IF WE WERE TO

02:35:08.599 --> 02:35:09.933
FALL HE WOULD PICK US UP.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:10.534
WE KNEW THAT IF THERE WERE

02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:11.201
DISAPPOINTMENTS HE COULD MAKE A

02:35:11.268 --> 02:35:13.570
SMILE AND GIVE US WHAT WE NEEDED.

02:35:13.637 --> 02:35:18.375
TOLD ME HOW IMPORTANT EDUCATION

02:35:18.442 --> 02:35:21.211
WAS EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE.

02:35:21.278 --> 02:35:24.448
AND THAT HE WOULD QUOTE DRINK

02:35:24.515 --> 02:35:27.751
MUDDY WATER AND SLEEP IN A

02:35:27.818 --> 02:35:28.752
HOLLOW LOG IN WANTED TO SEND ME

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:30.721
TO SCHOOL.

02:35:30.788 --> 02:35:37.294
AND HE MEANT EVERY WORD OF THAT.

02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:38.562
AND IS A POWERFUL FORCE THOUGH

02:35:38.629 --> 02:35:48.672
GIRL TO FIGHT. TO LIVE FOR THE

02:35:48.739 --> 02:35:50.441

02:35:51.241 --> 02:35:53.043
RESILIENT.

02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:55.212
MY DAD WOULD PICK ME UP AT UCLA.

02:35:55.279 --> 02:35:57.314
I DID NOTICE THINGS.

02:35:57.381 --> 02:35:59.316
LIKE THE GIRLS HEAD ON KNEE

02:35:59.383 --> 02:36:00.350

02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:01.518
SOCKS.

02:36:01.585 --> 02:36:03.721

02:36:16.033 --> 02:36:17.468
SAW HIM.

02:36:17.534 --> 02:36:19.436
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT AS A COLLEGE

BUT I WORKED AND BOUGHT A CAR

02:36:24.842 --> 02:36:26.376
BUT HE MADE SURE THAT CAR WAS

02:36:26.443 --> 02:36:28.178

02:36:34.485 --> 02:36:35.986
IN MY EDUCATION.

02:36:36.053 --> 02:36:37.087
AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS THERE HE

02:36:37.154 --> 02:36:39.690
DID IT. ONE STORY I REMEMBER

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:41.291
HE'D NEVER SAW ME REALLY STUDY

02:36:41.358 --> 02:36:42.559
HARD BECAUSE I LIVED IN THE DORM

02:36:42.626 --> 02:36:44.094
BUT WHEN I CAME HOME ONE SUMMER.

02:36:44.161 --> 02:36:45.829
I WAS STUDYING OVER AND OVER FOR

02:36:45.896 --> 02:36:46.864
A GREEK MOMENT OR TOWARDS

02:36:46.930 --> 02:36:48.565

A FRIDAY NIGHT INVESTED IT ALL

02:37:02.713 --> 02:37:03.413
NIGHT LONG.

02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:04.081
MY DADDY GOT UP AND WALKED BACK

02:37:04.148 --> 02:37:04.982
AND FORTH TO THE BATHROOM I

WHEN THEY APPLY FOR THE TAX

03:08:05.807 --> 03:08:07.175
CREDIT IS NOT THE FACT THAT YOU

03:08:09.111 --> 03:08:11.647
IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY ENFORCE IT.

IN BECAUSE THEY WERE BRUSHED

03:08:27.462 --> 03:08:28.697
