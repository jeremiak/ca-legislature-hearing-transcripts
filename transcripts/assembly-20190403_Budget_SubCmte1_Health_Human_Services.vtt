00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:24.555
AND FLOWED WITH -- OF THE

00:40:24.622 --> 00:40:26.457
POVERTY LEVEL AND ON YOU KNOW IN

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:27.691
TIMES OF RECESSION WE'VE HAD TO

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:30.127
DECREASE THEM -- AND OBVIOUSLY

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:31.529
IN THE PAST WE HAD GRANT LEVELS

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:33.097
OR MUCH HIGHER MUCH CLOSER TO

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:34.431
THEIR ACTUAL NEEDS OF OUR

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:35.633
CLIENTS SO THEY'LL HAVE THE

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:37.234
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT IN A

00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:37.902
MOMENT.

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:39.403
I'M MY COMMENTS THE WERE REALLY

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.873
GOING TO FOCUS MORE ON THE

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.341
STRUCTURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:48.712
PROPOSAL AND FIRST AT THE OUTSET --

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:50.915
I THINK -- WE JUST WANT TO TAKE

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:52.950
THIS MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE THE

00:40:53.017 --> 00:40:54.652
ENORMOUS PROGRESS THAT.

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:55.986
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE THE

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:57.488
ADMINISTRATION ARE MAKING ON

00:40:57.555 --> 00:40:59.957
GRANTS I MEAN TWO DAYS AGO WE

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:02.326
INCREASE GRANTS BY 10% I'VE BEEN

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.260
IN THIS JOB I BELIEVE FIFTEEN

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:04.628
YEARS.

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:05.229
IT'S THE SINGLE LARGEST GRAN

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.297
INCREASE.

00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:08.032
ABOUT I'VE EVER WITNESSED --

00:41:08.098 --> 00:41:09.400
IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL IT WAS A

00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:10.835
SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT I HAD THE

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.736
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS TO

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.471
GROUP OF CAL WORKS -- STUDENT

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:15.906
PARENTS A FEW WEEKS AGO AND THEY

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:17.474
WERE ECSTATIC WHEN I TOLD

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:18.042
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:18.843
GRANT INCREASES SO THISIS A

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:20.611
VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:21.345
RECIPIENTS.

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:27.017
AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME IN HIS

00:41:27.084 --> 00:41:28.986
FIRST BUDGET CAME OUT IN. TO GET

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:29.553
EVEN OF A BIG STEP FURTHER

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.187
INCREASING THE GRANTS PROPOSING

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:30.721
ANOTHER THIRTEEN POINT 1%

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:31.488
INCREASE IN THE GRANTS THAT

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:33.057
WOULD BEGIN THIS OCTOBER.

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:35.693
AND SO -- I YOU KNOW WE MADE AN

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.328
AGREEMENT ALL OF US LAST YEAR IN

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:38.596
THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:40.231
TRY TO IN DEEP POVERTY IN THE

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:41.465
CALLER'S PROGRAM.

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:43.434
AND IT WAS REALLY GREAT TO SEE

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.135
THE GOVERNOR KEEPING THAT

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:47.438
COMMITMENT -- AND SO WE WANT TO

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:48.439
JUST PUT THAT OUT ON THE TABLE

00:41:48.505 --> 00:41:50.774
IS THAT WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET IS

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:51.942
A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD AND

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:53.010
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REALLY

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:55.412
APPRECIATE -- THE GOVERNOR'S

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:58.782
EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD -- WE

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:00.784
HOWEVER WE ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:02.586
TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:05.289
RECONSIDER EXACTLY HOW WE

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:07.458
PROVIDE THIS THIS GRANT AMOUNT

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:09.260
WE IT'S US RATHER SUBSTANTIAL

00:42:09.326 --> 00:42:10.027
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:12.429
AND THE WAY THE GOVERNOR'S

00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:13.397
PROPOSED TO DO IT IS TO

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:14.465
ESSENTIALLY DO THE WAY WE'VE

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:16.066
ALWAYS DONE GRAN INCREASES WHICH

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:18.202
IS TO DO IT ON ACROSS THE BOARD

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:19.837
THIRTEEN POINT 1% INCREASE. FOR

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:21.639
EACH OF THE HOUSEHOLD SIZE IS

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:22.506
THAT WE HAVE IN THE COLLEGE

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:24.541
PROGRAM -- AND ALL OF THOSE

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.210
FAMILIES NEED INCREASES THERE'S

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:27.411
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THEY COULD

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:29.213
ALL USE ALL THIRTEEN POINT 1% OF

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:29.847
IT.

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:31.882
BUT WHEN WE ASSESS THE VARIOUS

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:34.051
NEEDS OF OUR FAMILIES WHAT WE

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:36.687
SEE IS A VERY LARGE GAP.

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:39.390
BETWEEN -- WHAT WE CALL A ONE

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:41.825
PERSON CAL WORKS HOUSEHOLD AND

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:43.928
THE TWO PERSON GRANT LEVEL --

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:45.896
IT'S IT'S A A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:47.564
OF ALMOST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:49.466
DOLLAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A ONE

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:51.402
PERSON GRANT AND A TWO PERSON

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:51.635
GRANT.

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:53.437
BUT THE NOTION OF A ONE PERSON

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:55.306
GRANT IS REALLY KIND OF A

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:57.741
FICTION -- THERE ARE NO ONE

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:59.476
PERSON GRANTS THEY'RE ALL TO

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:01.111
PARENT THEY'RE ALL TWO PERSON

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:03.380
HOUSEHOLD THAT MINIMUM BECAUSE

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:05.082
WHAT ONE PERSON GRAN IS IS

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:07.985
ESSENTIALLY -- OF A CHILD ONLY

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:09.753
CASE WHERE WE HAVE ONE CHILD

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.622
ELIGIBLE IN THE HOUSEHOLD BUT WE

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:13.824
ALSO HAVE AN ADULT AT LEAST ONE

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:15.225
ADULT IN THAT HOUSEHOLD.

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:17.227
SO WE WOULD REALLY STRONGLY

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.129
ENCOURAGE AN APPROACH THAT WOULD

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:21.799
TRY TO RAISE ALL GRANT LEVELS I

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.400
THINK THE ONLY -- MADE THIS

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:27.671
RECOMMENDATION IN THEIR IN THEIR

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:29.807
REPORT REYES ALL GRANT LEVELS UP

00:43:29.873 --> 00:43:30.908
2408% ACROSS THE BOARD SO THAT

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:31.542
ALL THE GRANTS WE DISTRIBUTE THE

00:43:31.608 --> 00:43:32.476
MONEY IN A WAY THAT WOULD GET

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:33.911
ALL THE VARIOUS HOUSEHOLD LEVELS

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:35.245
UP 240%.

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:37.948
INCLUDING THAT ONE SO CALL ONE

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:39.650
PERSON HOUSEHOLD SO THAT WE

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:41.719
REALLY GIVE A SUBSTANTIAL BUMP

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:43.554
TO THAT HOUSEHOLD INCOME BECAUSE

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.955
WE REALLY FEEL THAT.

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:46.223
I THINK IT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.825
PROPOSAL I I COULD BE WRONG

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:48.926
SLIGHTLY ON THIS I THINK IT'S

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:50.761
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:52.129
DOLLARS A MONTH IS WHAT THAT

00:43:52.196 --> 00:43:53.597
INCREASE WOULD GO.

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:55.466
TO THAT'S JUST IT'S IT'S

00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:57.668
IMPOSSIBLE FOR A FAMILY A TWO

00:43:57.735 --> 00:43:59.870
PERSON FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO

00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:01.238
EXIST AND RENT HOUSING IN

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:02.906
CALIFORNIA AT SUCH A LOW GROUND

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:03.407
LEVEL.

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:04.575
I MEAN THE GOOD THE GRANT

00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:06.377
INCREASE STILL WON'T GET US TO

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:08.145
THE PLACE THAT WE NEED TO BE BUT

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:09.646
I THINK WE WOULD STRONGLY

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:11.415
RECOMMEND THE REDISTRIBUTION

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.117
THAT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE LA L..

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.752
THAT WOULD MAKE THE GRANT LEVELS

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.253
HIGHER.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.454
FOR MAKING EQUAL FOR ALL

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:19.523
CASELOAD SIZES HOUSEHOLD SIZE

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:20.791
AND THEN -- EXPRESSLY LIFT THE

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:22.559
AMOUNT THAT WOULD GO TO THE ONE

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:24.495
PERSON HOUSEHOLDS SO THAT'S OUR

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:28.232
PROPOSAL AND WE ALSO -- WOULD

00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:30.901
CERTAINLY -- SUPPORT OF FURTHER

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:32.069
AUGMENTATION OF THIS YEAR'S

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:34.171
BUDGET -- TO BE ABLE TO GO EVEN

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:36.273
HIGHER BECAUSE AS GOOD AS THE

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.108
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS IT'S NOT

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.910
QUITE WHAT WE AGREED TO LAST

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:42.479
YEAR -- ON A BUDGET YOU'RE BASIS

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:44.048
I BELIEVE IT WOULD REQUIRE AN

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:45.616
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF ABOUT

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:46.283
SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.420
ACTUALLY GET US TO GO 250% --

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:50.087
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OVER A

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:52.623
FULL YEAR BUDGET FOR TWO IN

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:53.490
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THAT WAS

00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:55.492
THE COMMITMENT THAT WE ALL GREE

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:57.261
TO LAST YEAR AND WHILE THE

00:44:57.327 --> 00:44:58.495
THIRTEEN POINT 1% INCREASE IS

00:44:58.562 --> 00:44:59.930
SUBSTANTIAL AND GOOD.

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:01.131
IT IS A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.666
WHERE WE WERE HOPING TO GET IN

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:04.501
THIS BUDGET YEAR SO AGAIN WE

00:45:04.568 --> 00:45:06.203
WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING TO HAVE.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.704
TO LOOK AT HAVING WELL A

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:09.573
SLIGHTLY LARGER -- AUGMENTATION

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:15.045
AN INCREASE IN THE GRANT LEVELS

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:17.548
IN THIS BUDGET YEAR.

CALIFORNIA WHAT FOR RIGHTS

00:45:48.545 --> 00:45:50.214
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN

REPRESENTING BOTH OF YOU SIT

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:51.548
BINS.

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:55.986
SINCE THE PREVIOUS CENTURY OF

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:57.121
NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND ONGOING.

00:45:57.187 --> 00:45:59.823
THE FACT I WAS AROUND IN.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:00.958
NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE OKAY A FDC

00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:03.026
WE GOT A COST OF LIVING INCREASE

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.728
AND THE AND THE AND THE

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.163
LEGISLATION.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.932
AND THE COOK AND WE GOT A COLA.

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:11.168
SINCE THEN FOR THE PAST TWO

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:14.605
CENTURIES -- ARC OF BENEFITS

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:16.507
HAVE BEEN UNDER ATTACK.

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:18.709
WE WERE ATTACKED I HAVE A TABLE

00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:20.210
ONE OVER HERE THAT SHOWS.

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:22.913
THAT THE FIRST ATTACK CAME IN

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.314
NINETEEN EIGHTY AND EIGHTY ONE

00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:25.682
WHEN JERRY BROWN BECAME GOVERNOR

00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:29.586
HE WE JUST UP BENEFITS BY TWO

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:31.054
POINT 1%.

00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:32.789
THEN IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO IT

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:33.590
WAS SO WITH THOSE THE BY FIVE

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:34.358
POINT 8%.

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:36.593
THEN AGAIN TWO POINT 7%. EIGHT

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.762
POINT 9%.

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:40.030
AND THEIR SCHWARZENEGGER REDUCE

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:42.699
THAT BY 4% AND FINALLY WIPED OUT

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:44.334
THE COLDER.

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:46.336
AND WHEN JERRY BROWN CAME IN.

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:48.205
HE WITH THOSE THAT AGAIN BY 8%

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:50.107
AGAIN.

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:51.441
AND THE PAST TWO THREE YEARS

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:55.479
WE'VE GOTTEN MAYBE 20% 225% BACK

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:58.649
SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- BIT.

00:46:58.715 --> 00:47:00.717
THE AVERAGE CAL WORKS GRANT

00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:05.455
TODAY. FOR A FAMILY OF THREE IS

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:06.023
FIVE SIXTY EIGHT A MONTH AND

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:08.158
WHEN I SAY TODAY I MEAN MARCH.

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:10.027
BECAUSE IN A POLL.

00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:12.196
ED AND THAT'S REPRESENTS 32% OF

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:13.697
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. FOR

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:16.266
THE AVERAGE CAL WORKS FAMILY.

00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:18.902
IN A POOR ONE AND ONE UP 235% OF

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:21.305
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:23.140
IN OCTOBER WANT THE NEW SIM

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:24.641
INCREASE GOES INTO EFFECT.

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:28.879
AND THAT BRINGS IT UP 238% OF

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:30.214
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.049
SO WE STILL ARE WAY BELOW THE

00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:34.184
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:36.553
THE NEXT ROOM TABLE.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.955
TWENTY SHOWS.

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.189
THE IMPACT OF THE MITCHELL

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:41.258
INCREASE AND THE NEW SIM

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.659
INCREASE.

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.127
THEN WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA TWO

00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:45.495
REGIONS.

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:47.331
OF REGION ONE WOULD BE LIKE LOS

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:49.933
ANGELES AMPS THIS GOAL.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.768
A SANTA CLARA DOES OF THE

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:54.838
EIGHTEEN COUNTIES THE REST OF

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.440
THE COMES ON REGION.

00:47:56.506 --> 00:47:58.041
IN REGION.

00:47:58.108 --> 00:47:59.643
ONE THIS.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.111
THREE THE THREE CATEGORIES OF

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:07.651
FAMILIES THAT GO OVER THE 50%.

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:08.252
TWO THREE FOUR FIFTY TO FIFTY

00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:11.221
ONE AND FIFTY FIFTY ONE THE REST

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:11.955
OF MUST DO UNDER.

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:13.657
THAT EVEN AFTER THE NEW SOME

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:16.126
INCREASE. FOR THE SECOND REGION

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:17.361
WHICH IS FRIENDS THOUGH

00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:20.397
SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY.

00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:22.199
ONLY FAMILY OF TOOL MAKES THE

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:27.404
ABOVE ABOUT 50% THE REST OF OUR

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:28.872
BE LOWERED.

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:30.073
OUR PROPOSAL BASICALLY IS WHICH

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.541
IS TABLE.

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:33.577
FOR IS TO LOOK AT ONE PARENT

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.245
FAMILY IN A CHILD.

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:36.480
AND GIVE THEM WHAT THE FEDERAL

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:38.815
PUT 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:41.351
LEVEL INPUT TWO PARENT FAMILIES.

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:44.054
IN A CHILD WHAT THE FEDERAL

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:45.289
POVERTY LEVEL WOULD BE.

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:46.723
IT WOULD BE BASED ON THE

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.225
CHILDREN AND THE PARENTS.

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:49.760
THEN YOU MAY WONDER WHERE WOULD

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:52.062
WE GET THE MONEY FROM.

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:55.966
AND IF YOU LOOK AT TABLE.

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.601
FIVE THIS IS THE ILLUSTRATION OF

00:48:57.668 --> 00:48:58.869
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH THE

00:48:58.935 --> 00:49:02.372
CAL WORKS MONEY. FOR THE PAST.

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:03.907
TWENTY YEAR IS ABOUT THIRTY

00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:06.043
BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN TAKEN

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:08.712
AWAY FROM THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM.

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.080
AND BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:12.816
GENERAL FUND.

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:15.585
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHAT

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:17.187
HAPPENED DOT COM IN THE GREAT

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:18.889
RECESSION EVEN WHEN THE CASE

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:20.190
LOAD WHEN UP.

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:21.792
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS

00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:23.460
TAKEN AWAY FROM THE CAL WORKS

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:24.561
PROGRAM.

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:26.430
THEY GIVE IT TO THE GENERAL FUND

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:28.398
STAY THE SAME.

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:29.833
SO THIS YEAR.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.903
THE BUT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS.

00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:34.638
THAT BUFFY FIVE BILLION. FIVE

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:35.339
POINT ONE BILLION WOULD BE

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.574
USEFUL CAL WORKS TWO POINT FIVE

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:39.142
BILLION WOULD BE USED FOR OTHER

00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:40.410
PURPOSES.

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:41.845
LIKE -- WHICH IS RELIEF TO THE

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:43.280
GENERAL FUND.

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:46.817
SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS AT LEAST

00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:48.719
A BILLION DOLLARS.

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.854
THAT YOU COULD FIND IN AND TABLE.

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.389
ONE THAT COULD BE USED -- TO TO

PROMULGATE.

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:54.991
TABLE.

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.059
FOUR AND IF THERE IS MONEY LEFT

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:57.761
OVER.

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.463
IN THIS PROGRAM AND AND AND THE

00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:00.597
PROGRAM BETTER THAN GIVING UP

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:01.898
THE GENERAL FUND THE SHIP IN THE

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:04.067
RESERVE WHICH IS A SUBSEQUENT

00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:04.468
ISSUE [inaudible]

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:07.003
THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.872

TYLER WOODS HAS NOTHING.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.249
FINANCE AND NOTHING IN COMMON

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:22.519
NOT THIS TIME VERY GOOD -- LET'S

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:24.121

ALLEGE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M.

00:50:27.724 --> 00:50:28.925
IN THINKING ABOUT THE DECISION

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:30.827
BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:32.095
LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR.

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:33.530
IN OUR VIEW IT'S IT'S REALLY

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:35.499
ABOUT RECONCILING THE DIFFERENCE

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:37.501
BETWEEN THE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:38.969
PROPOSAL FOR THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:41.071
AND THE MULTI YEAR PLAN THAT THE

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:44.541
LEGISLATURE ADOPTED LAST BUDGET --

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:47.444
FOR CAL WORKS GRANT INCREASES --

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:48.712
ULTIMATELY AND ARGUE THE

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:50.847
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS A IS

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:52.282
CLEARLY CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:54.151
LEGISLATURE'S SORT OF OVERALL

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.685
PLAN FOR OUR SPRING CREASES IT

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:57.354
IS A STEP IN THE IN THE SAME

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:58.722
DIRECTION.

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:00.624
BUT THERE ARE A FEW.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.726
KEY DIFFERENCES ARM FIRST AND

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:04.494
FOREMOST -- THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:06.163
pPLAN ULTIMATELY WOULD ALSO

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:07.764
INCREASE GRANTS 250% OF THE

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:09.166
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL BUT WOULD

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:12.302
DO SO. FOR A FAMILY SIZED THAT

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:14.104
IS ONE PERSON LARGER.

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:15.806
THAN THE THE COLORS ASSISTANCE

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:17.607
UNIT SIZE WE USE ASSISTANCE UNIT

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:18.742
TO DESCRIBE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:19.843
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.545
AND AND THIS IS A BY PRODUCT OF

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:23.513
THE REALIZATION OR THE REALITY

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.214
THAT.

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:25.782
IN MORE THAN HALF OF CAL WORKS

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.951
CASES THERE ISN'T AN ADULT IN

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:30.554
THE FAMILY WHO IS INELIGIBLE TO

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.955
RECEIVE A SO IF YOU SET.

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:34.424
GRANT SAT 50% OF THE FPL AND

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:36.126
MORE THAN HALF OF CASES -- THE

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:38.528
FAMILY ITSELF -- WOULD WOULD BE

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:40.397
BELOW 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:41.298
LEVEL.

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:42.332
I'M ANOTHER KEY DISTINCTION IS

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:43.867
THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN IS A

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:44.968
MULTI YEAR PLANS.

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:45.936
ARE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:46.703
GRAND INCREASE FOR THE BUDGET

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.672
YEAR THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN AS

00:51:48.738 --> 00:51:50.474
ADOPTED LAST YEAR WOULD HAVE

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.876
SORT OF A FINAL GRANT INCREASE --

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:56.680
TO TAKE PLACE IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:57.180
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SOME.

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:59.349
AND SO AND THINKING ABOUT THE

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:00.650
LEGISLATURE'S PLAN IN THE

00:52:00.717 --> 00:52:03.487
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN OUR VIEW.

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:04.654
WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:07.624
CONSIDER WHAT WANT TO DO FIRST --

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:09.926
ONE OPTION IS TO CONTINUE THE

00:52:09.993 --> 00:52:11.661
ACROSS THE BOARD APPROACH AS THE

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:12.462
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BY

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:13.864
INCREASING GRANTS BY THE SAME

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.198
AMOUNT.

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:17.300
ON ANOTHER OPTION IS TO TO TO

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:18.768
FOLLOW SORT OF THE THE INITIAL

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:20.403
STEP OF THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.038
WHICH WOULD INCREASE GRANTS BY

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:27.043
VARYING AMOUNTS AND AND MR

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.211
HERALD REFERENCE TO THIS.

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:29.246
SPECIFICALLY THESE GRANT AMOUNTS

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:30.180
FOR THE SMALLEST A FEW SIZES

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:31.982
WOULD BE INCREASED BY A LARGER

00:52:32.048 --> 00:52:33.917
PERCENTAGE AMOUNT THAN THAT FOR

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.452
OTHER GRANTS SOARED. TO BRING

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.687

FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL -- IN

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.027
THINKING ABOUT.

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:45.996
THIS OPTION WE POINTED OUT A

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.297
COUPLE ALTERNATIVES FOR THE

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:49.199
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ONE OF

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:50.600
WHICH WAS THE THE ALTERNATIVE

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:52.903
THAT MR HERALD MENTIONED -- BUT

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:54.638
WE WOULD NOTE THERE REALLY ARE

00:52:54.704 --> 00:52:56.606
MULTIPLE PASS FORWARD FOR THE

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:57.274
SUB COMMITTEE AND FOR THE

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.742
LEGISLATURE IT MAY NOT BE ONE OF

00:52:58.808 --> 00:53:00.243
THE THINGS THAT WE SPECIFICALLY

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:03.213
POINTED OUT -- ONE OPTION IS TO

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.348
SIMPLY CONTINUE ON THE PATH AS

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:06.850
IT WAS OUTLINED.

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:08.585
IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:09.920
ACT BY REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:11.821
PROPOSAL AND CONTINUE IN THAT

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:12.322
DIRECTION.

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:13.590
ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD WORK

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:14.891
WITH IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:16.893
AMOUNTS BUT DISTRIBUTE RANTS

I THINK OUR REACTION IS THAT.

00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:46.149
IN THE CONTEXT OF A NATIVE

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:51.121

CURRENTLY CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE

BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE.

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:14.978
CAL WORKS CLIENTS IN THAT

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:18.982
HOUSEHOLD.

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:21.084
THE A YOU IN ONE WITH ONE CHILD

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:24.287
REASONABLY AND ON A DID ADULTS

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:25.321
HAS A FURTHER.

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.990
HAS FOR THIS TO GO AND I THINK

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:29.359
THAT WAS DISCUSSED -- EARLIER

00:55:29.426 --> 00:55:30.760
AND I THINK THAT -- MISTER

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.195
HURLED TALKED ABOUT BRINGING

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:34.197
EVERYBODY UP AS PROPOSED BY THE

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:37.167
LA -- TO THE 48%.

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:39.202
OF THE POVERTY LEVEL.

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:40.970
EVEN WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:44.507
THIS TO BRINGING OUR CHILDREN UP.

00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:47.877
TO THE 48% OF FEDERAL POVERTY

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:50.180
LEVEL I KNOW THAT THAT THAT IS

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:52.148
WHERE WE ARE NOW AND THAT IS

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:54.217
WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:56.653
HOW CAN WE FIX THIS? TO ASSURE

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.789
THAT NO CHILD IS DISADVANTAGED

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:02.692
IN THIS AREA IN THIS THIS EFFORT.

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:04.594
AND TO BRING CHILDREN. TO BRING

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:09.032
EVERY CHILD OUT OF DEEP POVERTY.

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:10.700
WOULD ONE OF YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:15.572
THAT.

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:17.907
THAT HAS OUR AGAIN THANK YOU.

00:56:17.974 --> 00:56:21.311
I THINK THAT APPROACH WAS WHAT

00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:23.646
WAS EMBODIED AND DISCUSSED AS

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:25.081
PART OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:26.850
BUDGET ACT INCLUDED IN TRAILER

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:29.652
BILL THE MULTI YEAR APPROACH --

00:56:29.719 --> 00:56:31.755
UNDER -- THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:34.457
TO INCREASE GRANTS 250% OF THE

00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:37.026
FPL AT A MINIMUM -- FOR ALL AGES

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:38.228
SIZES.

00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:40.730
ACCOUNTING FOR A USE THAT MIGHT

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.699
HAPPEN UNAIDED ADULT ON AND SO

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.768
THAT WAS THE THE THE MOTIVATION

00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:48.371
AND THE AND THE THE AIM OF THE

00:56:48.438 --> 00:56:50.807
LEGISLATURE'S PLAN AND EIGHTEEN

00:56:50.874 --> 00:56:51.608
NINETEEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.076
THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:57.180
US TO THE TO THE 50%.

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.982
I JUST -- JUST AS WE MOVE

00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:00.583
FORWARD I I RECOGNIZE WERE

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.985
TRYING TO WORK WITH FINITE

00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:03.386
NUMBERS.

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:05.622
BUT THAT IS.

00:57:05.688 --> 00:57:07.957
OF OF SERIOUS CONCERN YES MISS

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:08.858
REVIEW WOULD JUST HAVE A COMMENT

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:12.262
AND I THERE'S A ON PAGE TWELVE

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:13.897
THERE'S A CHART.

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:18.401
THAT SAYS IN A AYE -- A YOU SIZE --

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:21.437
ONE IS THAT 43%.

00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:22.772
AND SO I THOUGHT THAT THE INTENT

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:24.607
WAS TO BRING THEM UP.

00:57:24.674 --> 00:57:25.341
TO FORTY EIGHT OR AT LEAST 50%

00:57:25.408 --> 00:57:26.176
BY.

00:57:26.242 --> 00:57:29.345
THE A YOU ONE IS 43% ARE WE

00:57:29.412 --> 00:57:31.848
ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE.

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:34.551
SO IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE

00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:36.686
THIRTEEN POINT 1% WAS CONSISTENT

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:37.954
WITH AN ACROSS THE BOARD

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:39.956
INCREASE AND THE ADMINISTRATION

00:57:40.023 --> 00:57:41.724
DID TARGET THAT INCREASED

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:44.661
TOWARDS -- A MAJORITY OF THE

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:47.463
CASES THAT FALL IN A YOU OF TWO

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:48.298
AND THEN A YOU OF THREE NOT.

00:57:48.364 --> 00:57:49.966
SO WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE U.

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:51.634
ONES IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THEY

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:54.003
DID RECEIVE A THIRTEEN POINT 1%

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:54.971
GRANT INCREASE RIGHT YOU'RE

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:56.606
CORRECT THAT IT DOES NOT BRING

00:57:56.673 --> 00:57:59.475
IT UP 250% FOR RIGHT AND SOUL IS

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:02.779
THERE AN INTENTION.

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:05.715
TO FIX THAT BECAUSE 43% IS NOT.

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:07.951
I EVEN IF YOU DO ANOTHER 13% OR

00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:09.452
WHATEVER IT IS ACROSS THE BOARD

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:10.720
IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE TO

00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:13.189
BRING THAT EIGHTY ONE BACK UP TO

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.324
FORTY EIGHT OR 50%.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:16.593
AND SO THERE IS IS THERE A PLAN

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:21.130
TO ADDRESS THAT SPECIFICALLY.

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:24.234
I'D I WOULD SAY AT THIS TIME.

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.736
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WAS TO

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:28.504
FIGURE OUT WHERE ALL OF HIS

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:32.375
PRIORITIES WERE AND TO GIVE.

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:34.544
US THE BOARD FOR YES OR NO.

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:35.411
THERE'S NOTHING CURRENTLY

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:36.613
PROPOSED STAND ON THE GOVERNOR'S

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:38.615
BUDGET FOR THAT OKAY SO IS THERE

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:40.850
ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO OR

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:42.652
WHAT CONVERSATION SHOULD WE BE

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:43.853
HAVING WITH YOU OR THE

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.255
ADMINISTRATION TO FIX THAT

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:48.191
BECAUSE AGAIN IT SOUNDS GREAT.

00:58:48.258 --> 00:58:49.926
THAT WE'RE BRINGING YOU KNOW 13%

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:51.761
ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:53.796
WE DID GREAT THINGS WHICH IS

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:55.932
GREAT FOR THE REST.

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.000
I MEAN IT'S STILL NOT EVEN

00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:58.034
ENOUGH BY.

00:58:58.101 --> 00:58:59.702
ELLIE SAID SOMETHING BITES FOR

00:58:59.769 --> 00:59:01.204
THESE FOLKS IN PARTICULAR IT'S

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:02.872
43%.

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:04.540
AND SOUL.

00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:06.409
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY IS STATE

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:08.077
AIDS -- THESE ARE CHILDREN

00:59:08.144 --> 00:59:09.846
CLEARLY THAT.

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:11.681
IF IT'S IN A YOU ONE THAT MEANS

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:12.949
IT'S THE TILE THAT'S RECEIVING

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.617
THE 42%.

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:15.151
BECAUSE THE PARENT IS MOST

00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:16.619
LIKELY NOT.

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:18.688
PART OF THE GRANT SO WHAT WE'RE

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:20.089
SAYING IS.

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:22.525
THAT A YOU ONE IS A CHILD.

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:27.964
THAT WE SAID 43% IS GOOD ENOUGH.

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:29.732
SO IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:31.701
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AS BUDGET

00:59:31.768 --> 00:59:34.103
DELIBERATIONS PLAY OUT AS MR

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.939
HERALD AND MISTER ALMA NOTED

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:38.341
THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:42.578
YOU CAN PROVIDE A GRANT INCREASE --

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:43.613
BUT IT'S ALL IN THE CONTACT IS

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.815
ABOUT THE NEGATIVE OF OF LIMITED

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:47.750
RESOURCES THE WAY I'D LIKE TO

00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:48.651
YOU KNOW I MEAN IF WE COULD DO

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:49.986
TRADE YOU KNOW JUST WITH ALL DUE

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:51.554
RESPECT IF WE COULD DO TRAILER

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:52.889
BILLS.

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:53.456
FOR YOUR NAME AND HOW MANY

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.892
TRAILER BURIALS WE'VE DONE IT

00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:57.026
THIS IN PARTICULAR AGAIN AND

00:59:57.093 --> 01:00:00.129
JUST -- MY CONCERN AS I SHARE

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:01.297
WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY IS

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:02.632
AND I'M SURE THE REST OF THE

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.567
COMMITTEE IS THE E. U. ONES WE

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:07.904
KNOW SPECIFICALLY THAT THERE THE

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.672
CHILDREN.

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:10.673
I MEAN I I UNLESS THERE'S A

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.841
DOUBT THAT THAT THE A YOU ONCE

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:12.942
OUR CHILDREN.

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:13.609
RIGHT AND SO WE'RE KIND OF DOING

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:14.744
IT.

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:15.745
NOT BACKWARDS BECAUSE I

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:18.548
APPRECIATE BUT THIRTEEN POINT 1%

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.850
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE THE A. YOU

ONE IS A CHILD.

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:24.320
AND SO.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:26.723
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE BALANCE THAT

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:27.924
BECAUSE IT'S SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:30.426
CHILDREN AND SO.

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:32.095
I WOULD LIKE.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.162
THIS IS A TIME FOR THE

01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:35.131
DISCUSSION I GUESS WE CAN PUSH

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.799

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:41.938
HEARING SO THAT WE COULD FIGURE

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:44.607

ON YOUR END AND ON OUR END AND

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.145

CAN TELL YOU THAT THESE ARE

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:54.751
CHILDREN.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.320
THE 42% AS A CHILD AND SO HOW DO

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:58.688
WE RECONCILE.

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:01.791
DIED WERE AT 42% FOR A CHILD

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.259
KNOWING THAT THERE'S TWO PEOPLE

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.660
IN THE HOUSEHOLD.

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:07.296

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:11.034
WITH WITH YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS --

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.602

BRING CHILDREN OUT OF THE

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:15.038
POVERTY I MEAN I HEAR THAT ALL

THE TIME WHICH IS A GREAT AND

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:17.707
NOBLE.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.510
COMMENT BY THE CHART SHOWS

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:22.245
OTHERWISE.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:24.013
SO I NEED YOUR HELP CAN WE HAVE

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.181
THAT DISCUSSION HERE.

CERTAINLY OKAY.

01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:32.121
AND I THINK WHAT SHOULD BE NOTED

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.557
AS MS JOHNSON SAID IS WHEN WE'RE

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:35.625
TALKING ABOUT A U..

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:36.759
S..

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:40.530
ONE THAT'S 26% OF ALL CHILDREN.

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:42.231
WAS THAT CORRECT.

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:43.433
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:45.501
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.937
THAT FALL UNDER THIS CATEGORY.

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:52.241
WHO REMAINED IN DEEP POVERTY --

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:54.177
I KNOW THE LA -- HAS IN THE

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:55.845
PROPOSAL TALKED ABOUT INCREASING

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:57.447
THE PERCENTAGE AND USING SOME OF

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.982
CASH AND FINDING OTHER WAYS AND

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:00.883
PERHAPS.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.152
THAT IS -- PART OF WHAT WE WOULD

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:05.088
LIKE TO TO DO MR HELL DID YOU

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:06.155
HAVE A COMMENT YOU'D LIKE TO

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.825
BRIEFLY MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU --

ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVIEW THANK YOU

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.894
VERY MUCH FOR REFERENCING THE

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.230
CHART ON PAGE TWELVE I THINK.

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:15.264
THE NUMBER THAT YOU'RE

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.966
IDENTIFIED I THINK IF YOU LOOK

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.201
AT THIS WHAT THIS REALLY IS A

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:20.470
REFLECTION OF IS A HISTORICAL

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:21.704
INEQUITY THAT HAVE BEEN BEEN

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.272
BUILT IN THE GRANT LEVELS FOR

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.273
DECADES.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.274
THAT WAS A CHOICE THAT WAS

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:26.909
ORIGINALLY MADE BY THE

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.511
LEGISLATURE AND APPROVED PRIOR

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.379
LEGISLATURE PRIOR GOVERNOR AND

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:31.747
IT'S A CHOICE THAT THIS

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:33.149
LEGISLATURE IN THIS GOVERNOR CAN

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:34.617
CHOOSE TO FIX.

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:36.686
AND SO I THAT'S WHY WE ARE

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:38.187
RECOMMENDING THAT WE DO ADOPT

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:40.089
LANGUAGE WITHIN THIS BUDGET THAT

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:41.657
WOULD ALLOCATE THE AMOUNT THE

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:42.959
GOVERNOR PROVIDES OR IF WE CAN

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.327
GET AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT.

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:45.661
THAT WOULD GO TO MAKING SURE

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:47.196
THAT EVERYONE IS AT THE SAME

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.965
LEVEL OF THE POVERTY LEVEL AND

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.466
WE DON'T CONTINUE THIS

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.301
HISTORICAL INEQUITY THAT WE SEE

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.937
FOR THESE SINGLE TRIAL

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.139
HOUSEHOLDS.

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:56.806
THANK YOU AND THE POINT THAT I'M

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.374
TRYING TO MAKE IS IS EXACTLY

01:02:58.441 --> 01:02:59.242
THAT.

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:01.277
THAT WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:03.713
THAT WE DON'T PAT OURSELVES ON

01:03:03.779 --> 01:03:05.581
THE BACK -- AGAIN IT'S REALLY

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:07.517
APPRECIATED THAT WE HAVE 13% BUT

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.485
IT REALLY ISN'T YOU KNOW IT'S

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:11.087
NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND IN THAT TIME

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:13.256
WHEN WERE BOASTING ABOUT THE THE

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:17.760
THE AXIS AND REVENUES.

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:19.929
IF YOU ARE THE OVER BUDGET OR

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:22.365
WHATEVER BOTH THE WORD WE CHOOSE

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:23.900
TO USE.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.001
JUST.

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:26.402
I CAN TALK IN PERCENTAGES BUT IT

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.738
WILL HIT HOME BETTER THAN.

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:31.407
THEY RECEIVE SIX THOUSAND TWO

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.041
HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:34.010
YEAR.

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:36.245
I I MEAN SIX THOUSAND TWO

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:36.913
HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:37.113
YEAR.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.550
THAT'S I I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:41.684
LIVE OFF OF THAT.

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.986
AND SO THE POINT I'M TRYING TO

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:46.389
MAKE IS THAT YES WE CAN CHOOSE

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:48.024
TO FIX IT BY BECAUSE WE'VE

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.592
ALREADY SAID HOW GREAT WE ARE

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.561

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:52.428
THIRTEEN POINT 1% I DON'T WANT

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:56.599
POINT TO PUT THIS IN SOME KIND

METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:51.820
ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS MIGHT BE

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:54.256

THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE TO

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:18.647
THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE --

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:19.982

THE CAL WORKS IN MEDICAL

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.028
PROGRAMS CAN CHANGE OVER TIME --

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:34.430
THE CASELOADS THE VARYING LEVELS

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:34.697

METHODOLOGY -- FOR FUNDING IN

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.368
AND OUT OF THAT RESERVE FIND.

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:46.609
MIGHT BE.

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:59.355
TYING OUR HANDS TO SOME EXTENT

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:00.789
AT LEAST FOR WITH THE

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:01.857
LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:04.226
HAVING FLEXIBILITY DURING A

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:04.994
DOWNTURN TO USE THOSE FUNDS.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:05.594
AND AGAIN JUST SO I REITERATE

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:06.128
THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE STILL

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:07.563
INTENDED TO GO TO THE TWO

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:13.902
PROGRAMS AS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:16.572
SOME FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER.

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.607
IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AS MY

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:19.842
COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.677
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN

01:11:21.744 --> 01:11:23.212
THE WAY WE DO ELFARE TO WORK.

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:24.279
SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:25.614
COWARDS PROGRAM.

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:27.149
WE DIDN'T HAVE A PROGRAM THAT

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:29.018
CLEARLY ARTICULATED WOULD WE

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:31.053
WANTED OUT OF IT HOW WE ARE WHAT

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.221
WE REALLY MEASURED WAS A FEDERAL

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:34.156
WORK PARTICIPATION RATE THAT WE

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:35.824
ALL KNEW WAS FLAWED.

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.326
I'M AND WE DIDN'T.

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:38.661
TRACK THOSE OUTCOMES AND

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:41.063
TRANSPARENTLY PUBLISH THEM AND

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.565
ASK COUNTIES TO USE THOSE THE

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.100
DATA ON THOSE OUTCOMES. FOR

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:47.136
CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:47.703
IN THOSE ARE REALLY THE KEY

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.271
ELEMENTS.

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:51.573
AS MY COLLEAGUE DISCUSSED -- AND

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.908
SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THE

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:54.476
PROGRESS WE'RE VERY PLEASED AT

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:55.544
THE PARTNERSHIP.

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:56.879
WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH ADD

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:58.847
ADVOCATES IT'S BEEN AN

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:01.483
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK -- MY

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.052
COLLEAGUES I TALKED ABOUT THE

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:04.620
MILESTONES THAT WERE REACHING I

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:06.588
CAN TELL YOU -- THIS IS AN

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:10.225
EXTREMELY HEAVY LEFT AND WE'RE

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:11.527
AT THE POINT WHERE THE TOUGH

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:13.228
PART WHICH IS OPERATIONALIZE

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:13.796
SAYING.

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:17.366
SO COLLECTING DATA -- FROM DATA

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:19.334
SYSTEMS THAT WERE NOT BUILT FOR

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:20.803
OUTCOMES MONITORING.

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:22.504

THEY'RE NO LONGER ON A ROLES --

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:29.645
AND SO THE AMOUNT OF CREATIVITY

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.613
AND THOUGHT GOING INTO EXACTLY

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.816

EFFORTS THAT WERE DOING.

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:32.227
THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL CULTURE

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:33.962
SHIFT THAT THE STATE IS ENGAGING

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.031
IN RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE WAY THAT

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:37.232
WE MANAGE.

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:40.669
THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM -- AND

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:42.604
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW -- WE WON'T

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:44.406
KNOW THE OUTCOMES FOR THAT FOR A

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:46.642
FEW YEARS BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.210
WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE REAL

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.579
DATA. FOR YOU FOR THE PUBLIC FOR

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.714
OURSELVES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:53.882
TO DO THESE KIND OF ASSESSMENTS

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.651
ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.352
INVESTMENTS THAT ARE COMING FROM

01:15:57.419 --> 01:16:02.557
THE STATE BUDGET EVERY YEAR --

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:04.860
SO -- I I I WOULD JUST BUT LET

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:05.994
ME JUST TRY IT THIS WAY BECAUSE

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:06.862
I WAS TRYING TO THINK ABOUT A WE

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:07.896
WAITED WE THIS ALL TOGETHER AND

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:08.697
I'M GOING TO PROBABLY

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.332
FUNDAMENTALLY CRASH AND BURN

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:10.532
HERE.

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:16.505
BUT SO IT IN OUR WAY OF THINKING --

01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:18.840
BOTH CAN OF TWO POINT NO CAL

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:19.474
WORKS TO POINT KNOWS IT'S BEING

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:23.045
CALLED AND CAL OR OR SORT OF ON

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:25.647
COMPLEMENTARY PIECES -- WE ARE

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:28.016
REALLY TRYING TO INSTITUTE A TWO

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.118
GENERATIONAL APPROACH TO ENDING

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:32.721
POVERTY AMONG EXTREMELY POOR

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:34.389
FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:35.924
AND WE'RE USING CALOR

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:38.060
PRINCIPALLY AS WELL AS A WAY TO

01:16:38.126 --> 01:16:39.962
MEASURE AND TRACK THE PROGRESS

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:41.063
THAT WE'RE DOING IN THAT

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:43.832
ENDEAVOR -- SO IT'S REALLY

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:45.901
ESSENTIAL THAT WE DO THAT BUT

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:48.003
THE SINGLE ALLOCATION FUND IN

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.738
OUR JUDGMENT IS THE SINGLE MOST

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:51.373
IMPORTANT DECISION THAT THIS

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.574
COMMITTEE WILL MAKE THIS YEAR.

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.443
BECAUSE REALLY WHAT WE'RE

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:55.644
TALKING ABOUT IS MISTER MAC A

01:16:55.711 --> 01:17:00.382
REFERENCE HISTORICALLY -- CASE

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:01.516
MANAGEMENT SERVICES WITHIN THE

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:02.985
SINGLE ALLOCATION SERVICES FUND

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:05.320
HAVE BEEN A FLAT AMOUNT SO FOR

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:07.856
EVERY CASE THAT THE COUNTY GETS.

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.591
NO MATTER WHAT THE NEEDS OF THAT

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.493
FAMILY THEY GET THE SAME AMOUNT.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.894
AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:15.163
ABOUT NOW IS AN APPROACH THAT

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.531
WOULD REALLY.

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:19.801
HAVE US PRIORITIZE AND PUT MONEY

01:17:19.868 --> 01:17:22.237
TO WHERE WE WANT COUNTIES TO

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.171
FOCUS.

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.507
SO FAMILIES IN OUR JUDGMENT WITH

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:27.075
THE GREATEST NEEDS FAMILIES WHO

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:29.277
ARE HOMELESS FAMILIES WHO HAVE

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:30.545
FAILED TO KEEP CHILDREN WITH

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.047
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES OR

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:35.150
OTHER CHALLENGES -- FAMILIES WHO

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.852
ARE FACING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OF

01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:37.886
THESE ARE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:39.321
TRAUMA AND CRISIS WHEN THEY COME

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.223
IN THE OFFICE OFTEN AND WE WANT

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:42.224
TO MAKE SURE THAT COUNTIES ARE

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.192
INCENTIVIZE FINANCIALLY TO

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:46.795
REALLY ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:47.562
RIGHT UP FRONT.

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:48.964
I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:51.233
LEGISLATURE TO THINK WHEN WE SEE

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:52.667
THE MAY BE REVISED PROPOSALS

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.803
ABOUT WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:57.305
ADDITION TO THAT THAT WE WANT.

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.974
TO WE WANT TO FOCUS ON AND FOR

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:02.010
US AS WE DISCUSS IN MANY FORMS

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:04.246
WE REALLY BELIEVE IN EDUCATION

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:06.748
WE REALLY WANT TO SEE FAMILIES

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.650
ENCOURAGED TO GO TO EDUCATION.

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:10.552
SO WE WOULDN'T AND ENCOURAGING

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.521
AGAIN A CASE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.389
WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE COUNTIES

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:18.026
TO GO TOWARDS EDUCATION -- STE

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.461
SO AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM INTO

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:20.962
THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE MIGHT

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.532
NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE WITH A

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:25.367
LARGE CASE MANAGEMENT FEE.

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:26.701
THE CONVICTED THERE THE OLD

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:28.403
APPROACH THAT WE'VE HAD OF WORK

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:29.571
FIRST WHICH IS SIMPLY GO THROUGH

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:31.139
THE THE JOB CLUB TRY TO GET A

01:18:31.206 --> 01:18:33.575
JOB RIGHT AWAY -- AND HOPEFULLY

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:34.843
WORK YOURSELF UP PARTY WE THINK

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:36.711
THAT THAT MODEL HAS RUN ITS

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.680
COURSE SO THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:39.247
YOU TO SEE THAT THERE'S A

01:18:39.314 --> 01:18:41.416
POTENTIAL RANGE THERE OF OPTIONS

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:42.184
THAT ARE AVAILABLE.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.518
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE SINGLE

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:45.220
ALLOCATION IN MANY WAYS IS GOING

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:47.322
TO DRIVE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.091
WILL GET THROUGH CALOR AND THE

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:50.859
SUCCESS THAT WE CAN GET FROM PAN

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:51.626
OF TWO POINT NO.

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:53.295
SO I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THAT

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:54.996
APART I MEAN THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.798
PUT A HEAVY FOCUS ON THAT WHEN

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:59.835
WE COME TO MAY REVISE -- ONE OR

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:00.435
TWO ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT I

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:06.708
WOULD JUST SAY -- ON TEN OF TWO

01:19:06.775 --> 01:19:08.110
POINT NO -- WELL I THINK THE

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:09.878
DILEMMA THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:11.046
IS -- IS THAT THE THE STATUTE

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:12.914
CONTINUES TO READ AS A WORK

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.883
FIRST MODEL IT'S A VERY RIGID

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:15.984
APPROACH.

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:18.186
I'M I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.354
SHOULD MAKE SOME.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.256
CHANGES TO THE STATUTES WITHIN

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:22.858
THIS EXISTING BUDGET I THINK

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:24.392
THAT WOULD TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:26.361
FOUGHT AN EXAMINATION FOR US TO

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:27.662
MAKE THOSE KIND OF CHANGES.

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:28.830
BUT I DO THINK THAT THE

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.499
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO BE

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:32.100
SENDING A SIGNAL.

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.768
THAT WE ARE CHANGING.

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.403
AND SO WE COULD DO THAT I THINK

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.339
THROUGH SOME INTENT LANGUAGE

01:19:37.405 --> 01:19:38.974
THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT AND I

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.408
THINK THEN WE COULD FOLLOW THAT

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:42.043
UP BY HAVING TRAILER BILL

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:43.678
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CREATE A

01:19:43.745 --> 01:19:45.647
STAKEHOLDER WORK PROCESS. TO

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:47.816
LOOK AT HOW COULD WE AND SHOULD

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:49.751
WE CHANGE THE STATUTE IN THE

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.953
FUTURE AND TO BRING THAT BACK

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:52.754
FOR CONSIDERATION BY THIS

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.789
COMMITTEE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.158
ONE BUDGET CYCLE.

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:57.392
I I DO THINK -- ON ALL THIS IS

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:58.660
COMPLICATED WE NEED TO ALL GET

01:19:58.727 --> 01:19:59.728
IN A ROOM AND REALLY PUT OUR

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:00.996
THINKING CAPS ON AND TRY TO

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:02.097
FIGURE THIS OUT.

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:04.766
SO THAT WOULD BE OUR THAT WOULD

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.601
BE OUR PROPOSAL ON HOW TO TO

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:08.203
MOVE FORWARD ON THE ON THE TOWN

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:10.438
OF TWO POINT OO SCOURS TWO POINT

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:11.473
OH EXCUSE ME FOR SAYING THAT

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.073
AGAIN.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:12.974
I'M AND THEN UNDER THE DISORDER

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.643
QUEST THAT WE WOULD HAVE AROUND

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:22.684
THE SINGLE ALLOCATION IS THAT --

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.152
WHY WE THINK THAT IT'S GREAT

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:24.886
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE --

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:26.488
INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO HELP THE

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:27.589
FAMILIES OF THE GREATEST NEEDS

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:28.657
AND WE'RE PUTTING MONEY INTO

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.692
WHERE WE THINK THE PRIORITIES OF

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:32.160
THE COUNTIES FOCUS SHOULD BE.

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:34.529
ON WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.498
THAT ARE RECIPIENTS ARE ACTUALLY

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:39.601
GETTING THE SERVICES THAT ARE

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:40.936
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDED.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.637
AND SO ONE THING THAT I THINK WE

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:44.873
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IS IN

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.708
THE PROCESS AND THE CONCEPT OF

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:48.376
THE SINGLE ALLOCATION IS.

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:50.745
HOW DO WE FLIP THE SWITCH IF YOU

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:53.748
CAN ON SERVICES SO ONCE THE

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:55.584
COUNTY AUTHORIZES AND SAYS

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:56.718
YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL?

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:57.719
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THE

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.020
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND YOU'RE

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:00.155
GONNA TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS OF

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:02.057
CLASS AND AT THE MOMENT THAT

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:03.325
THAT HAPPENS THE COUNTY

01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:05.994
AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZES THE THE

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.596
AN ALLOCATION FOR BOOKS THAT

01:21:07.662 --> 01:21:09.164
WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THAT

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:09.631
STUDENT.

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.099
SO THE STUDENT THE CURRENT WAY

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.234
THINGS WORK THE STUDENT HAS TO

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.502
COME BACK TO THE WORKER PRESENT

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:15.904
WITH THEIR BOOKS ARE AND THEN

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:17.606
THE THE WORKABLE MAKE THAT

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:19.107
STUDENT JUSTIFY THAT THE STUDENT

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:19.908
PARENT JUSTIFY THAT.

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:22.677
WE FREQUENTLY SEE IF -- PARENTS

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:24.145
WERE SITTING IN THEIR SECOND

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:25.847
THIRD FOURTH WEEK OF CLASS AND

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:26.915
WE STILL DON'T HAVE THEIR BOOKS.

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:28.617
WE HAVE TO IN THOSE KIND OF

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:30.085
THINGS I THINK CHILD CARE IS

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:32.854
ANOTHER ARENA WHERE WE ALSO NEED

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.522
TO BE FLIPPING THE SWITCH THAT

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:36.491
ONCE WE AUTHORIZE A WELFARE TO

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:37.292
WORK PLAN.

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:39.594
CHILD CARE JUST OUGHT TO GO WITH

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:40.629
IT THE THE WORKER.

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:42.297
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO BACK AND

01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:44.165
SPEND MORE TIME GOING THROUGH

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:46.201
PAPERWORK RE AUTHORIZING

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:47.535
SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY IN TOP

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:49.137
AN ENTITLEMENT IN THE LAW.

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.639
SO THESE ARE THE KIND OF CHANGES

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:52.607
THAT WE WE THINK ARE NECESSARY

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:54.209
THAT WOULD BOTH STREAMLINED THE

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:55.143
PROGRAM TAKE SOME OF THE

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:57.312
COMPLEXITY OUT OF MAKE IT EASIER.

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.713
FOR THE RECIPIENTS TO GET

01:21:58.780 --> 01:21:59.881
THROUGH THIS AND ALLOW THE

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:02.917
WORKERS TO BE SOCIAL WORKERS AND

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:09.090
NOT BE PAPER PUSHERS -- AND THEN --

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:10.091
ON THE SAFETY NET.

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.059
FIRST OF ALL WE SUPPORT

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:11.860
OBVIOUSLY THE AUGMENTATION

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:12.794
THAT'S BEING PROPOSED BY THE

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:14.095
ADMINISTRATION THE SAFETY NET

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.096
RESERVE I'M SPEAKING OF NOW.

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:16.798
WE APPRECIATE THE THE THE

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:17.899
GOVERNOR'S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:18.833
THAT.

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.568
WE WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:23.705
HAVING ALL THE MONEY AND WANT.

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:26.741
TO COUNT -- OR YOU KNOW -- CAL

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:29.377
WORKS IS FREQUENTLY TAKEN VERY

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:32.414
DEEP CUTS IN PRIOR BUDGETS --

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.915
AND I WOULD JUST BE.

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:35.483
LESS THAN HONEST I DIDN'T SAY

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:36.685
THAT YOU KNOW THEM.

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:38.153
THE HEALTHCARE ARENA HAS A LOT

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:39.821
OF POWERFUL INTEREST GROUPS AND

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.756
AT HAS A LOT OF STRONG ADVOCATES --

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:44.092
THERE AREN'T AS MANY IN THE WALL

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:45.293
FOR WORLD I THINK

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.361
PUTTING SOME WALLS AROUND THAT

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.662
FUNDING TO PROTECT THAT AND MAKE

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:48.930
SURE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:51.433
SUBSTANTIAL FOR OUR TO REHAB GOD

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.401
FOR BID ANOTHER BAD BUDGET IS

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:55.270
REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND THEN WE

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:58.373
REALLY DO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTER

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.941
THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS PUT IN

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.409
LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL THAT

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:03.545
WOULD TRY TO MOVE -- AS WE SEE

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:05.714
CASELOAD DECLINES AS OUTLINED AS

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.615
BY MS JOHNSON EARLIER AS WE SEE

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:09.451
THOSE CASELOAD DECLINES THAT WE

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:10.719
WOULD TAKE SOME OF THAT REVENUE

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:12.420
AND PUT IT INTO THE SAFETY NET

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:13.188
RESERVE.

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:14.789
AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE'VE

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:16.057
BEEN DOING THAT OVER THE LAST

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:18.159
SAY HALF DOZEN YEARS WE REALLY

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.694
HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL RESERVE

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:20.695
BECAUSE OUR CASELOADS DROPPED A

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:22.630
LOT FRANKLY WE PROBABLY SHOULD

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:23.264
HAVE BEEN DOING THE SAME THING

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:25.266
IN OUR SOCIETY -- SO UNFORTUNATE

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.968
WE CAN'T SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:28.503
RECOMMENDATION ON THAT PIECE --

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:32.507
BUT WE DO AND WE DO APPRECIATE

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:33.708
THE AUGMENTATION THANK YOU.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:34.442
YOU DON'T SUPPORT YOU SUPPORT

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.277
THE SEVEN HUNDRED BILL YES NOT

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:37.612
OKAY YES BUT NOT THE POST SO

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:38.947
WE'RE CLEAR NOT THE POLICY

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:43.151
CHANGE IS WONDERFUL --

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:45.687
DEPARTMENT FINANCE.

01:23:45.754 --> 01:23:47.689
TOWARDS HER TO FINANCE NO

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:48.123
COMMENT AT THIS TIME

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.423
[inaudible]

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.792
HELLO [inaudible]

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.093
ALL.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.195
SPEAKING EXCLUSIVELY TO THE THE

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:56.164
SAFETY NET RESERVE QUESTION --

01:23:56.231 --> 01:24:00.068
SO JUST TO GO BACK A BIT IN THE

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:00.635
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AN

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:01.669
INITIAL DEPOSIT OF TWO HUNDRED

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:02.971
MILLION DOLLARS WAS MADE IN THE

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:04.239
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING.

01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:06.875
A US A SECOND DEPOSIT OF SEVEN

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:07.942
HUNDRED MILLION FOR TOTAL NINE

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:08.343
HUNDRED MILLION.

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.311
ON IN DOING SO THE GOVERNOR ALSO

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:12.414
PROPOSES SOME STRUCTURAL CHANGES

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.815
TO HOW THE RESERVE WOULD WORK

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.150
OUR OFFICE MADE NO SPECIFIC

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:16.885
RECOMMENDATIONS TO APPROVE OR

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:20.455
NOT THOSE STRUCTURAL CHANGES --

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:21.589
RIGHT NOW THE NINE HUNDRED

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:22.557
MILLION UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:23.658
PROPOSAL WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.160
BE USED FOR EITHER CAL WORKS FOR

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:27.462
MEDI CAL IS MR HERALD MENTIONED --

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:29.864
PREVIOUSLY UNDER THE EIGHTEEN

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:30.765
NINETEEN BUDGET STRUCTURE THERE

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.200
ARE TWO SUB ACCOUNTS SO THEY

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:34.436
WERE THEY WERE SEPARATED -- WE

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:35.870
POINT OUT WE'RE NOT.

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:38.540
CERTAIN HOW MUCH SEPARATION IN

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:40.308
PRACTICE THAT PROVIDED IT WAS

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:42.277
CLEARLY A SIGNAL BUT THEY WERE

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:43.945
STATUTORY SOME ACCOUNTS SO THE

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:45.280
LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE AT ANY

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:46.648
POINT IN THE FUTURE.

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.683
JANE STATUTE AND MOVED FUNDS

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.051
BETWEEN THOSE TWO SUB ACCOUNTS

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:52.120
IF SOMETHING AS AS MISTER WOODS

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:54.522
MENTIONED -- CHANGED REGARDING

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:55.857
ONE OF THE PROGRAMS AND THE

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.759
FLEXIBILITY WAS NEEDED -- SO WE

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.093
THINK THAT'S A QUESTION REALLY

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.161
FOR THE LEGISLATURE GOING

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:01.429
FORWARD OUT REGARDING THE

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:03.264
WHETHER OR NOT TO USE A FORMULA

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:05.166
DRIVEN DEPOSIT SORT OF AN

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:06.835
AUTOMATIC THE POSITIVE CASELOAD

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:10.405
SAVINGS EACH YEAR.

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:11.706
ON WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:12.373
THE FORMULA DRIVEN APPROACH THAT

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.641
WAS A PART OF THE EIGHTEEN

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.376
NINETEEN BUDGETARY STRUCTURE FOR

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:15.677
THE RESERVE.

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:17.278
MIGHT.

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:19.848
RESULT IN A SORT OF RECOMMENDED

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.549
AUTOMATIC DEPOSIT THAT WASN'T IN

01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:22.851
THE LEGISLATURE'S BEST INTEREST

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:25.186
IN SOME FUTURE YEAR -- AND SO WE

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:27.155
DO APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY OF

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:29.791
NOT HAVING AN AUTOMATIC DEPOSIT --

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:31.259
BUT WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:32.460
LEGISLATURE.

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:33.895
REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.330
FINANCE EACH YEAR TO BASICALLY

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:37.265
PUBLISHED THAT CASE LOAD SAVINGS

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:38.933
NUMBER AND MAKE IT PART OF THE

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.236
BUDGET CONVERSATIONS SO BETWEEN

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.671
EARLY SPRING AND AND THE THE

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:45.106
SIGNING OF THE BUDGET AX THE

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:45.707
LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:46.341
CONSERVE.

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:48.309
NEGOTIATE AROUND THAT CASELOAD

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:50.512
SAVINGS NUMBER AND DETERMINE HOW

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:52.013
MUCH GIVEN THE LETTERS LEADERS

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.182
PRIORITIES SHOULD BE SET ASIDE

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:55.984
IN THE RESERVE FOR FUTURE YEARS

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:57.685
OR USE FOR OTHER PURPOSES -- SO

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:58.853
WE WE THINK OF THAT AS A SORT OF

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.722
A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN THE TWO

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:04.125
APPROACHES THAT THAT WE WOULD.

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:04.626
AT LEAST SUGGEST IF NOT

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:07.428
RECOMMEND.

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:13.201
VERY GOOD THANK YOU.

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:16.771
ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM.

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:21.743
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:23.611
I DO WANT TO COMMENT THAT I

01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:24.212
THINK THAT THIS.

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.847
ENTIRE NEW APPROACH IS JUST

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.382
WONDERFUL WERE WHERE WE'RE

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:29.217
TALKING ABOUT BEING SOCIAL

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:30.118
WORKERS.

01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:33.555
BECAUSE IF THE ENTIRE INTENT IS

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.023
TO GET OUR CHILDREN IN THE

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:36.958
FAMILIES OUT OF DEEP POVERTY NOT

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.126
OF POVERTY.

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:38.893
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.728
NEED TO BE DONE WE TO GET JOBS

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:42.964
WE TO GET TRAINING -- AND YOU'RE

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.266
RIGHT IF THE IF THE IF THE THE

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:47.602
PARENTS HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:48.570
GO TO SCHOOL.

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:50.538
IT SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC WE WE

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.106
SHOULDN'T HAVE.

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:53.808
TO FIGURE OUT TO ANOTHER PAPER

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.610
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT SHOULD

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:58.513
BE A PROCESS SO THAT IT CAN BE

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.248
ACCOMPLISHED OTHERWISE.

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.716
OKAY WE'VE GOT IN SCHOOL THAT ME

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:03.384
MEANT NOTHING BECAUSE IF THEY

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:05.553
DIDN'T HAVE THEIR BOOKS.

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.589
THAT BECOMES A SERIOUS PROBLEM --

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:11.526
I IN ONE OF THE COMMENTS.

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:13.161
ON THE SINGLE ALLOCATION I KNOW

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:16.197
THAT THE THE ADVOCATES.

01:27:16.264 --> 01:27:18.166
WHAT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS SO I

01:27:18.232 --> 01:27:19.734
WOULD ASK THAT THE

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:21.235
ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE AS?

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:24.439
THAT PARTICULAR -- PART OF IT IS

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:26.374
IS IS YEAR YOU'RE GOING THROUGH

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:28.810
THAT CAN CAN WE INCLUDE THE AT

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:31.412
THIS THE ADVOCATES.

01:27:31.479 --> 01:27:35.116
IN THAT DISCUSSION.

01:27:35.183 --> 01:27:38.286
FINANCE WOODS A BUT WE'VE

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:39.787
CURRENTLY WERE WORKING WITH THE

01:27:39.854 --> 01:27:46.894
COUNTY PARTNERS BUT IF THERE IS.

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:48.463
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST MADAM

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:49.097
CHAIR I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK THE

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:51.065
STATUTE TO MAKE SURE THAT IS

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:52.333
APPROPRIATE.

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.268
BUT IF THAT IS INDEED THE CASE

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:56.904
WE COULD HAVE A DISCUSSION

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:58.072
EVERYONE JUST PULL SO LET'S

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.440
ASSUME IT IS APPROPRIATE.

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:02.477
THEN WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:05.780
INCLUDE THE STAKEHOLDERS.

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:06.748
I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT YOU ON THE

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:08.383
SPOT I JUST THINK THAT IF IT'S

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:09.083
SOMETHING.

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.652
IN THE END WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:11.919
GET TO THE SAME PLACE.

01:28:11.986 --> 01:28:13.921
WE WANT TO WE DON'T WE WANT TO

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:16.090
MOVE THINGS FORWARD.

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:17.425
AND IF WE HAVE STAKEHOLDERS.

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:20.595
WHO ARE SO CONCERNED AND WANT TO

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.030
BE INCLUDED IN THIS?

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:23.464
THEN WHEN WHEN IT THE PROPOSAL

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:25.633
IS BROUGHT TO THE COMMITTEE THEN

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.068
THE DISCUSSION IS ALL THE

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.770
STAKEHOLDERS GOT TOGETHER WE

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:30.071
DISCUSS THIS.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.239
THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE DON'T

01:28:31.305 --> 01:28:33.007
JUST WE DON'T AGREE ON BUT THIS

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:34.776
WAS DISCUSSION THIS IS THE END

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:37.845
RESULT -- AS OPPOSED TO HERE'S

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:38.446
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:40.448
STAKEHOLDERS WELL WE DON'T KNOW

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:43.117
ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW WE WANT TO

THAT WE DO PROTECT THEM BECAUSE

WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMS

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:29.911

OUTCOMES AN ACCOUNTABILITY

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:44.578
REVIEW.

01:34:44.645 --> 01:34:46.580
IDEA ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:49.283
WE WERE FACING WAS THE INABILITY

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.818

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:51.786
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING FOR THE

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.487
MONEY WE KNEW WE WERE DOING GOOD

01:34:53.554 --> 01:34:55.623
THINGS WE'RE PROUD OF THE WORK

01:34:55.689 --> 01:34:57.191
WE WERE DOING BUT WE AS A STATE?

01:34:57.258 --> 01:34:59.126
NEVER ARTICULATED THE OUTCOMES

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:00.561
WE DIDN'T GATHER THE DATA TO

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:03.864
TRACK THEM -- AND SO A KEY.

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:06.467
REASON BEHIND THE DEPLOYMENT OF

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:07.101
THE NEW OUT COMES AN

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:08.869
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IS TO BE

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:12.173
ABLE TO RESPOND TO EXACTLY THE

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.675

PARTNERSHIP WHICH REQUIRES A

01:52:45.825 --> 01:52:47.594
PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE IN SOME

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.662
CASES THAT'S NOT A VIABLE --

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:50.630
PERCENT THERE'S NOT NOT ENOUGH

01:52:50.697 --> 01:52:54.000
OF A POPULATION -- TO MATCH THE

01:52:54.067 --> 01:52:55.168
CASELOAD THAT THAT THAT NURSE

01:52:55.235 --> 01:52:56.102

A MAHOOD UPON VISITING AND WE DO

01:53:01.975 --> 01:53:03.376
PLAN IN OUR NEXT SPENDING CYCLE

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:04.978
TO AGAIN OFFER REGIONAL APPROACH

01:53:05.044 --> 01:53:06.146
AND PROVIDES MORE TECHNICAL

01:53:06.212 --> 01:53:12.318
ASSISTANCE TO SEE IF THAT WOULD

01:53:12.385 --> 01:53:12.519
HELP.

01:53:12.585 --> 01:53:14.621
ENSURE IT STATE WIDE.

01:53:14.687 --> 01:53:15.288

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:30.270
A SUICIDE RATE ALSO OF THE THE

01:53:30.336 --> 01:53:32.138
INABILITY.

01:53:32.205 --> 01:53:33.139

THE GRANT GRADUALLY COMES DOWN

01:55:16.776 --> 01:55:19.379
AND SO DURING THAT TIME A CLIENT

01:55:19.445 --> 01:55:20.813
CAN COMBINE THEIR EARNINGS.

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.348
THERE GRANT AND THEIR WORK

01:55:22.415 --> 01:55:24.150
SUPPORTS LIKE TRANSPORTATION OR

01:55:24.217 --> 01:55:25.918
CHILD CARE.

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:28.521
SO THEY COULD GRADUALLY MOVE

01:55:28.588 --> 01:55:31.324
FROM RECEIPT OF AID TO SELF

01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:33.359
SUFFICIENCY WE WANTED TO CREATE

01:55:33.426 --> 01:55:35.361
A BRIDGE TO SELF SUFFICIENCY NOT

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:36.929
A CLIFF.

01:55:36.996 --> 01:55:39.265
AND THAT WAS A KEY TENET OF THE

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:40.800
BIPARTISAN CHOLERIC SPELL.

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:42.435
THE PROBLEM IS YOUR AGENDA LAYS

01:55:42.502 --> 01:55:44.170
OUT BASED ON AN EXCELLENT REPORT

01:55:44.237 --> 01:55:45.605
BY THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND

01:55:45.672 --> 01:55:46.973
POLICY CENTER.

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.274
IS THAT THE WORK INCENTIVES THAT

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:49.876
THE LEGISLATURE CREATED FOR THE

01:55:49.942 --> 01:55:52.045
CAL WORKS PROGRAM HAS DEGRADED

01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:54.013
SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT'S BECAUSE

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.114
THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD

01:55:55.181 --> 01:55:56.482
HASN'T BEEN UPDATED IN TWENTY

01:55:56.549 --> 01:55:57.817
YEARS.

01:55:57.884 --> 01:55:59.519
INFLATION IN THE MINIMUM WAGE

01:55:59.585 --> 01:56:02.055
HAVE SO SIGNIFICANTLY DEGRADED

01:56:02.121 --> 01:56:03.623
THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD THAT

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:05.124
WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS MORE LIKE A

01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:07.894
CLIFF -- THEN A BRIDGE.

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.462
HAD IT BEEN UPDATED FOR

01:56:09.529 --> 01:56:10.963
INFLATION AND FOR CHANGES IN THE

01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:12.565
MINIMUM WAGE WE WOULD BE

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:14.600
DISREGARDING FIVE HUNDRED

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:16.736
DOLLARS ABOUT RIGHT ABOUT ROUND

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:18.237
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND 50%.

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:20.239
OF THE BALANCE NOT TWO HUNDRED

01:56:20.306 --> 01:56:22.175
AND TWENTY FIVE AND AS A RESULT

01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:24.210
WERE JEOPARDIZING THE SUCCESS OF

01:56:24.277 --> 01:56:27.580
THE PROGRAM. TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE --

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:28.715
IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT A

01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:30.216
PERSON WITH A FULL TIME MINIMUM

01:56:30.283 --> 01:56:32.652
WAGE WORK WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP

01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:33.853
THEIR GRANT.

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.154
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR

01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:37.957
WORK SUPPORTS -- FROM THE COW

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:38.958
WORKS PROGRAM.

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:40.927
THEY WOULD NOT EXIT OFF THE

01:56:40.993 --> 01:56:43.162
PROGRAM UNTIL THEIR EARNINGS

01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:45.264
EXCEEDED FULL TIME MINIMUM WAGE

01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:46.165
WORK.

01:56:46.232 --> 01:56:48.101
THAT VERY SAME CLIENT TODAY

01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:49.602
EARNING MINIMUM WAGE IS

01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:52.872
INELIGIBLE FOR CALYX.

01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:54.874
AND SO NOT ONLY DO THEY LOSE

01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:57.143
THAT THAT THE SUPPORT OF THE

01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:59.178
GRANT BUT THEY ALSO LOSE THE

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:02.115
WORK SUPPORTS THAT GO ALONG WITH --

01:57:02.181 --> 01:57:04.050
WITH THE COWART'S PROGRAM.

01:57:04.117 --> 01:57:05.518
HAD WE INDEX THE EARNED INCOME

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.520
DISREGARD FOR INFLATION IN THE

01:57:07.587 --> 01:57:08.588
MINIMUM WAGE.

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:10.323
THAT SAME CLIENT THAT I TALKED

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:12.825
ABOUT WOULD HAVE ABOUT TWO

01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:13.626
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:15.528
MONTH MORE.

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:17.563
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. FOR A

01:57:17.630 --> 01:57:19.732
FAMILY WORKING REALLY HARD TO

01:57:19.799 --> 01:57:21.434
TRY TO MOVE THEMSELVES FROM

01:57:21.501 --> 01:57:23.035
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE INTO THE WORK

01:57:23.102 --> 01:57:23.903
FORCE.

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:25.638
AND THE CURRENT SITUATION LEAVES

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:28.374
A TERRIBLE CATCH TWENTY TWO FOR

01:57:28.441 --> 01:57:30.343
WORKING CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS.

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.978
TURN DOWN A SHIFT.

01:57:32.044 --> 01:57:33.579
SO I DON'T LOSE THE VITAL WORK

01:57:33.646 --> 01:57:36.983
SUPPORTS OR INCREASE MY WORK

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:39.152
BECAUSE I WANT TO BUT THEN LOSE

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:41.387
THE KEY THINGS THAT ALLOWED ME.

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:43.489
TO SORT OF GET THE TO TO GET THE

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:46.392
JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE -- I

01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:47.493
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.695
SKYROCKETING RENTS HAVE ACTUALLY

01:57:49.762 --> 01:57:51.230
MADE THE PROBLEM MUCH WORSE

01:57:51.297 --> 01:57:53.499
BECAUSE RENTS HAVE RISEN ABOUT

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:55.001
THREE TIMES FASTER THAN WAGES

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:55.802
AND INFLATION.

01:57:55.868 --> 01:57:57.703
AND SO.

01:57:57.770 --> 01:57:59.372
I THINK IT'S ARGUABLE THAT THE

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:01.174
EXIT POINT FOR CAL WORKS SHOULD

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:03.109
BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IT

01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:05.511
WAS IN INFLATION ADJUSTED TERMS

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:07.880
THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT

01:58:07.947 --> 01:58:10.883
BECAUSE AS CLIENTS LEAVE -- CAL

01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:12.952
WORKS WITH RENTS THAT ARE SO

01:58:13.019 --> 01:58:15.888
HIGH THE ABILITY TO TO REMAIN.

01:58:15.955 --> 01:58:18.791
HOUSE AND TO REMAIN EMPLOYED AND

01:58:18.858 --> 01:58:20.126
NOT NEED TO COME BACK ON TO

01:58:20.193 --> 01:58:21.928
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IS THAT MUCH

01:58:21.994 --> 01:58:22.829
MORE DIFFICULT.

01:58:22.895 --> 01:58:24.063
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE RENTS

01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:25.298
ARE SO HIGH.

01:58:25.364 --> 01:58:26.732
SO SEAT EVERY DAY AS A PROPOSAL

01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:29.469
IT'S ACTUALLY REFLECTED IN AB

01:58:29.535 --> 01:58:30.102
FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX STONE WERE

01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:31.537
HAPPY TO WORK ON THIS ALONG WITH

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:32.705
THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:35.141
POVERTY. TO RAISE THE DISREGARD

01:58:35.208 --> 01:58:37.043
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IN

01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:38.878
INTO CERTAIN INCREMENTS. TO

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:40.646
UPDATE IT TO ACCOUNT FOR

01:58:40.713 --> 01:58:42.482
INCREASES IN INFLATION IN THE

01:58:42.548 --> 01:58:43.916
MINIMUM WAGE.

01:58:43.983 --> 01:58:46.018
AND THEN EVENTUALLY INDEX IT FOR

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:48.287
INFLATION THEREAFTER SO WE DON'T

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:50.022
HAVE THE SAME DEGRADATION THAT

01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:52.091
WE'VE HAD OVER THE PAST. TWENTY

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:54.760
YEARS THAT WOULD RESTORE THE

01:58:54.827 --> 01:58:56.529
POLICY TO WHERE THE LEGISLATURE

01:58:56.596 --> 01:58:58.164
INTENDED IT TO BE ON A

01:58:58.231 --> 01:58:59.866
BIPARTISAN BASIS TWENTY TWO

01:58:59.932 --> 01:59:02.635
YEARS AGO WHEN IT CREATED THE

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:05.004
COWARDS PROGRAM -- A SIDE

01:59:05.071 --> 01:59:07.240
BENEFIT IS THAT IT WOULD IMPROVE

01:59:07.306 --> 01:59:08.641
CALIFORNIA'S FEDERAL WORK

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:10.643
PARTICIPATION RATE BECAUSE AS

01:59:10.710 --> 01:59:12.078
THOSE WORKING PEOPLE LEAVE THE

01:59:12.144 --> 01:59:14.614
ROLES WE NO LONGER GET CREDIT

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:15.681
FOR THEM IN THE FEDERAL WORK

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:16.849
PARTICIPATION RATE.

01:59:16.916 --> 01:59:18.384
SO YOU REDUCE THE RISK OF

01:59:18.451 --> 01:59:20.553
FEDERAL PENALTIES IN ADDITION TO

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:23.222
HELPING PEOPLE AVOID A CLIFF --

01:59:23.289 --> 01:59:24.824
AND SO WE THINK THERE'S

01:59:24.891 --> 01:59:26.125
PRECEDENT FOR THIS THE

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:27.760
LEGISLATURE HAS MADE A VERY

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:29.328
SIMILAR CHANGE IN THE EARNED AND

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:30.930
INCOME TAX CREDIT.

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:32.265
IN OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE CHILD

01:59:32.331 --> 01:59:34.433
CARE -- TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.968
IN THE MINIMUM WAGE WE THINK

01:59:36.035 --> 01:59:37.503
THAT THIS WOULD BE IT INCREDIBLY

01:59:37.570 --> 01:59:39.906
IMPORTANT WAY. TO HELP RESTORE

01:59:39.972 --> 01:59:42.208
CAL WORKS TO ITS ORIGINAL INTENT

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:43.910
WHICH WAS TO REALLY SUPPORT THE

01:59:43.976 --> 01:59:46.546
TRANSITION TO PEOPLE MOVING FROM.

01:59:46.612 --> 01:59:48.214
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE TO WORK

01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:50.249
WITHOUT PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM

01:59:50.316 --> 01:59:51.551
UNDER THEM [inaudible]

01:59:51.617 --> 01:59:54.453

ADDITIONAL SKILLS FOR OVERCOMING

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:21.480
ADVERSITY.

02:00:21.547 --> 02:00:22.481
AND ENCOURAGES AND THE

02:00:22.548 --> 02:00:24.216
CONSIDERATION OF HOW THE VARIOUS

PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENTS

02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:27.486
INTERACT -- AND WOULD SUGGEST

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:29.221
THE SORT OF THE CAN BE COMBINING

FACTUALLY CORRECT WITH THE

02:04:37.570 --> 02:04:39.805
EXCEPTION OF YOUR CONSULTANT --

02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:41.340
NONE OF YOU WERE HERE I BELIEVE

02:04:41.407 --> 02:04:43.709
DURING THE TIMES WHERE WE MADE

02:04:43.776 --> 02:04:47.313
REALLY ENORMOUS BUDGET.

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:48.013
RELATED.

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:50.149
CHANGES TO THE TOWERS PROGRAM IN

02:04:50.216 --> 02:04:50.850
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN TWO

02:04:50.916 --> 02:04:51.817
THOUSAND WE WEREN'T HERE BUT WE

02:04:51.884 --> 02:04:54.086
WERE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE

02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:54.553
WERE.

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:57.423
PAINED DURING THOSE TIMES AND

02:04:57.489 --> 02:04:59.592
THAT IS WHY OUR OUR CONSULTANT

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:01.527
TO IS SO IMPORTANT TO THIS

02:05:01.594 --> 02:05:03.495
COMMITTEE DID SHE IS.

AND I WOULDN'T WANT ANY OF YOU

02:05:07.132 --> 02:05:08.467
TO EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT

02:05:08.534 --> 02:05:11.670
EXPERIENCE I AM SINCERELY -- BUT

02:05:11.737 --> 02:05:13.472
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID

02:05:13.539 --> 02:05:15.441
DURING THAT TIME AS WE MADE VERY

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:17.042
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CAL

02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:20.012
ARTS PROGRAMS -- IN TWO THOUSAND

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:21.213
ELEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:22.815
ALL OF THIS REALLY BEING DRIVEN

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:25.818
BY THE THE DIRE NATURE OF OUR

02:05:25.885 --> 02:05:27.052
STATE BUDGET THAT POINT WE'RE

02:05:27.119 --> 02:05:28.087
YOU KNOW.

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:29.889
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN IN

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:31.690
DEFICITS IN THE GOVERNOR WAS

02:05:31.757 --> 02:05:33.259
TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING TO TRY

02:05:33.325 --> 02:05:34.426
TO FIND A WAY TO BRING THE

02:05:34.493 --> 02:05:36.862
STATE'S -- FISCAL HOUSE BACK IN

02:05:36.929 --> 02:05:39.331
ORDER -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:05:39.398 --> 02:05:41.700
WAS DONE WAS THAT WE WE DID TWO

02:05:41.767 --> 02:05:43.836
MAJOR THINGS TO CAL WORKS -- WE

02:05:43.903 --> 02:05:44.470
DO MANY THINGS WE DID TWO MAJOR

02:05:44.536 --> 02:05:48.207
THINGS WE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

02:05:48.274 --> 02:05:54.713
MONTHS FROM SIXTY MONTHS.

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:55.247
TO FORTY EIGHT THAT PUTS

02:05:55.314 --> 02:05:56.949
CALIFORNIA IN THE MINORITY OF

02:05:57.016 --> 02:05:58.484
STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY EVEN

02:05:58.550 --> 02:06:00.653
STATES LIKE MISSISSIPPI HAVE A

02:06:00.719 --> 02:06:02.888
SIXTY MONTH TIME CLOCK FOR TAN

02:06:02.955 --> 02:06:03.889
OF BENEFITS.

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:05.758
OUR STATE DOES NOT --

02:06:05.824 --> 02:06:08.394
SECONDARILY -- THE FOLLOWING

02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:11.163
YEAR WE TOOK THOSE FORTY EIGHT

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:12.698
MONTHS AND WE DIVIDE THEM INTO

02:06:12.765 --> 02:06:13.899
TWO PIECES.

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:15.801
THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WAS

02:06:15.868 --> 02:06:17.236
CHANGE IN WHAT WAS CALLED A

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:19.204
FLEXIBLE CLOCK WHICH ALLOWED

02:06:19.271 --> 02:06:21.507
RECIPIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY

02:06:21.573 --> 02:06:22.975
ACTIVITY THAT THE ASSESSMENT

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:24.543
DONE BY THE COUNTY DETERMINE WAS

02:06:24.610 --> 02:06:26.178
NEEDED. FOR THEM.

02:06:26.245 --> 02:06:29.081
THAT WAS POTENTIALLY POSITIVE.

02:06:29.148 --> 02:06:30.549
BUT AFTER TWENTY FOUR MONTHS

02:06:30.616 --> 02:06:34.486
WE'VE THEN IMPOSED A THE THE

02:06:34.553 --> 02:06:36.221
CANNOT WORK FOR WORK REQUIREMENT

02:06:36.288 --> 02:06:38.390
RULES WHICH WERE MORE RIGID THAN

02:06:38.457 --> 02:06:39.358
ARE EVEN.

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:41.794
CALIFORNIA STATE ROLES THAT --

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:45.731
HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR THE LAST

02:06:45.798 --> 02:06:46.999
DECADE AND A HALF -- THE THE

02:06:47.066 --> 02:06:47.633
EFFECTIVE THAT REALLY WAS FOR

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.201
MANY CLIENTS IS THAT THEY REALLY

02:06:49.268 --> 02:06:51.236
FELT LIKE THEY THEY THEY HAD TO

02:06:51.303 --> 02:06:52.371
GET ALL EVERYTHING DONE IN THE

02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:54.406
FIRST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS.

02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:57.943
IT REALLY -- MADE CREATED A

02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:59.378
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONFUSION

02:06:59.445 --> 02:07:02.448
NOT JUST FOR OUR RECIPIENTS --

02:07:02.514 --> 02:07:03.749
IN OUR CLIENTS AS WE SOMETIMES

02:07:03.816 --> 02:07:05.417
CALL THEM BUT ALSO FOR THE

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:07.453
COUNTY WORKERS TRYING TO EXPLAIN

02:07:07.519 --> 02:07:09.421
HOW TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WORK THE

02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:10.255
OTHER TWENTY FOUR MONTH CLOCK

02:07:10.322 --> 02:07:10.789
WORK.

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:13.258
HOW THE EXTENSION POLICIES WORK --

02:07:13.325 --> 02:07:16.028
WAS ENORMOUSLY CONFUSING AND AND

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:17.930
REMEMBER THIS IS A POPULATION

02:07:17.997 --> 02:07:19.598
THAT WHEN THEY COME IN THE DOOR

02:07:19.665 --> 02:07:21.266
TO THE COUNTY WELFARE OFFICE

02:07:21.333 --> 02:07:23.635
THAT FIRST DAY THEY'RE OFTEN IN

02:07:23.702 --> 02:07:25.337
CRISIS THERE.

02:07:25.404 --> 02:07:27.272
THERE ARE HOMELESS THEY HAVE A

02:07:27.339 --> 02:07:28.941
CURRENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:07:29.008 --> 02:07:31.176
SITUATION AND IN THEIR LIFE

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:32.411
THEY'VE -- THEY MAY BE GOING

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:33.712
THROUGH A DIVORCE IS ALL SORTS

02:07:33.779 --> 02:07:35.014
OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.548
HIS FAMILY'S LIFE AND THEN WE

02:07:36.615 --> 02:07:38.217
THROW ALL THIS INFORMATION OUT

02:07:38.283 --> 02:07:40.019
ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT CLOCKS --

02:07:40.085 --> 02:07:41.820
RAND ACTUALLY DID AN ANALYSIS

02:07:41.887 --> 02:07:43.288
FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE IN

02:07:43.355 --> 02:07:44.390
THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS AND

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:46.058
AND ESSENTIALLY CAME TO THE SAME

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:47.459
CONCLUSION.

02:07:47.526 --> 02:07:49.595
THAT THE THAT MOVING TO THESE

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:50.195
TWO TWENTY FOUR MONTH CLOCKS

02:07:50.262 --> 02:07:52.898
REALLY HAD NO APPRECIABLE IMPACT

02:07:52.965 --> 02:07:54.566
ON THE PROGRAM AND REALLY DIDN'T

02:07:54.633 --> 02:07:56.435
BENEFIT -- CERTAINLY NOT THE

02:07:56.502 --> 02:07:59.138
RECIPIENTS AND IT REALLY WASN'T.

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:01.273
DOING ANYTHING TO REALLY MOVE

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:02.975
INVOLVEMENT PARTICIPATION AN

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:04.443
ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THE WELFARE TO

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:05.611
WORK PROGRAM.

02:08:05.677 --> 02:08:07.679
SO FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT WE

02:08:07.746 --> 02:08:09.081
REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS A

02:08:09.148 --> 02:08:11.583
FAILED POLICY AND ON THOSE

02:08:11.650 --> 02:08:13.352
GROUNDS TO BEGIN WITH WE WOULD

02:08:13.419 --> 02:08:15.587
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE. TO

02:08:15.654 --> 02:08:18.390
REVERSE THAT DECISION IN THIS

02:08:18.457 --> 02:08:21.894
BUDGET -- IN IN IN IN PARTICULAR

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:23.429
I WOULD NOTE THAT THE WAY THAT

02:08:23.495 --> 02:08:24.663
THE CURRENT FORTY EIGHT MONTH

02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:26.598
CLOCK IS STRUCTURED WITH THE TO

02:08:26.665 --> 02:08:27.866
TWENTY FOUR MONTH CLOCKS.

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:30.269
IS A DIRECT IMPEDIMENT TO THE

02:08:30.335 --> 02:08:32.004
ABILITY OF WELL WE DESCRIBED

02:08:32.071 --> 02:08:34.573
EARLIER AROUND THE NEW PROGRAMS

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:35.974
THAT ARE BEING ROLLED OUT AROUND

02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:37.476
CAL WORKS TWO POINT NO.

02:08:37.543 --> 02:08:40.345
CAL OR THESE ARE REALLY MORE

02:08:40.412 --> 02:08:42.081
MODERN PROGRAMS THAT OUR FAMILY

02:08:42.147 --> 02:08:49.455
FOCUS GOAL ORIENTED SO HAVING.

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:51.290
A PROGRAM IN WHICH THE COUNTY

02:08:51.356 --> 02:08:52.858
CANNOT MEET THE CLIENT WHERE

02:08:52.925 --> 02:08:53.492
THEY'RE AT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS

02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:54.126
FEDERAL OVERLAY OF RULES THAT

02:08:54.193 --> 02:08:55.527
REQUIRES.

02:08:55.594 --> 02:08:57.296
THEM TO HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:08:57.362 --> 02:08:59.498
WHAT AND WORK FIRST ALL IN WORK

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:00.566
FIRST IS THE PRINCIPAL AND

02:09:00.632 --> 02:09:02.668
FRANKLY ONLY ACTIVITY FOR MANY.

02:09:02.734 --> 02:09:04.603
IT'S GOING TO ACT AS A AS A

02:09:04.670 --> 02:09:06.972
SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO OUR

02:09:07.039 --> 02:09:09.241
ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS

02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:10.309
NEW APPROACH THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:09:10.375 --> 02:09:11.577
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER TODAY.

02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:14.046
SO WE REALLY SEE THE NEED --

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:16.014
WALL WE'RE NOT ASKING -- FOR

02:09:16.081 --> 02:09:18.283
STATUTORY CHANGES BROADLY WITH

02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:19.218
THAT IN THE WALL FOR WORK

02:09:19.284 --> 02:09:20.853
PROGRAM AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

02:09:20.919 --> 02:09:22.254
WE THINK A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

02:09:22.321 --> 02:09:24.356
WOULD BE THE PROPER THE PROPER

02:09:24.423 --> 02:09:25.691
WAY TO PROCEED ON THAT.

02:09:25.757 --> 02:09:28.994
IN THIS AREA WE ARE ASKING FOR

02:09:29.061 --> 02:09:30.696
THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH CLOCK.

02:09:30.762 --> 02:09:32.164
WITH THE FEDERAL RULES TO BE

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:35.400
ELIMINATED AND THAT WE TAKE THE

02:09:35.467 --> 02:09:36.235
TWENTY FOUR MONTH FLEXIBLE

02:09:36.301 --> 02:09:38.537
APPROACH AND ADOPT THAT FOR THE

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:40.105
AN EXTENDED OUT TO THE FULL

02:09:40.172 --> 02:09:41.673
LIMIT OF THE FEDERAL LAW.

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.308
OF SIXTY MONTHS ON THE TAN A

02:09:43.375 --> 02:09:45.511
PROGRAM THE TWENTY THE FLEXIBLE

02:09:45.577 --> 02:09:47.946
CLOCK COMPORTS PERFECTLY WITH

02:09:48.013 --> 02:09:48.847
THE NEW DIRECTION THAT WE'RE

02:09:48.914 --> 02:09:50.716
GOING AND WE THINK THAT THAT

02:09:50.782 --> 02:09:52.084
OUGHT TO BECOME THE STANDARD

02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:53.719
THAT WE USE IN THE CALPERS

02:09:53.785 --> 02:09:56.221
PROGRAM GOING FORWARD -- ONE OF

02:09:56.288 --> 02:09:57.523
THE REASONS THAT WE REALLY THINK

02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:59.358
THE SIXTY MONTH CLOCK NEEDS TO

02:09:59.424 --> 02:10:00.692
BE RESTORED.

02:10:00.759 --> 02:10:02.394
IS AS YOU HEARD EARLIER WE

02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:03.862
BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION IS THE

02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:06.298
KEY TO OUR CLIENTS SUCCESS OVER

02:10:06.365 --> 02:10:07.466
THE LONG TERM.

02:10:07.533 --> 02:10:10.736
BUT 50% OF THE PARTICIPANTS TO

02:10:10.802 --> 02:10:11.937
COMMON TO THE COUCH BERMAN THE

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:15.807
FIRST DAY DON'T HAVE A HIGH

02:10:15.874 --> 02:10:16.708
SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:17.309
THEY DON'T HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL

02:10:17.376 --> 02:10:17.976
DIPLOMA SO THE IDEA THAT THEY

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:20.379
CAN GET THAT G. D. ACCOMPLISHED

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:22.014
AND THEN GET INTO A COMMUNITY

02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:24.049
COLLEGE PROGRAM IF PERHAPS TRY

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:25.751
TO GET A BE A WHICH IS THE YOU

02:10:25.817 --> 02:10:26.585
KNOW THE GREATEST THING THAT

02:10:26.652 --> 02:10:27.986
COULD HAPPEN TO THEM IN TERMS OF

02:10:28.053 --> 02:10:28.320
THEIR LONG.

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:30.722
TERM SUCCESS IT'S SIMPLY NOT

02:10:30.789 --> 02:10:32.124
GOING TO HAPPEN IN FORTY EIGHT

02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:34.092
MONTHS I MEET CLIENTS ALL THE

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:37.129
TIME WHO COME TO ME AND SAY WOW --

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:39.131
I'M SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR AWAY

02:10:39.198 --> 02:10:40.432
FROM COMPLETING MY COURSE WORK

02:10:40.499 --> 02:10:41.366
HERE.

02:10:41.433 --> 02:10:42.901
BUT I JUST GOT MY LETTER FROM

02:10:42.968 --> 02:10:44.870
THE COUNTY AND I'M I'M HIT MY

02:10:44.937 --> 02:10:45.804
FORTY EIGHT MONTH CLOCK ANIMAL

02:10:45.871 --> 02:10:46.972
LOSE ALL MY SERVICES IN MY

02:10:47.039 --> 02:10:49.474
ABILITY TO COMPLETE MY PER WHAT

02:10:49.541 --> 02:10:51.043
CAN I DO.

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:52.010
HI I DON'T HAVE A VERY GOOD

02:10:52.077 --> 02:10:54.346
ANSWER FOR THAT IT'S IT'S SIMPLY

02:10:54.413 --> 02:10:56.281
AN IMPEDIMENT RIGHT NOW TO

02:10:56.348 --> 02:10:58.250
PERSONS BEEN ABLE -- TO OBTAIN

02:10:58.317 --> 02:10:59.618
THE EDUCATION THAT WE KNOW THAT

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:01.687
WILL BENEFIT THEM THE GREATEST

02:11:01.753 --> 02:11:02.988
IN THE LONG TERM.

02:11:03.055 --> 02:11:05.057
AND THEN WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY

02:11:05.123 --> 02:11:06.625
FAMILIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT

02:11:06.692 --> 02:11:11.597
CHALLENGES IN THEIR LIVES -- OUR

02:11:11.663 --> 02:11:13.365
CLIENTS PATHS THROUGH WELFARE TO

02:11:13.432 --> 02:11:14.132
WORK IS NOT ALWAYS A STRAIGHT

02:11:14.199 --> 02:11:16.935
LINE -- THEIR POOR A LOT OF

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:18.170
THINGS OCCURRED TO THEM THAT.

02:11:18.237 --> 02:11:20.105
MANY OF US DON'T GO THROUGH ON A

02:11:20.172 --> 02:11:21.840
DAILY BASIS HAVING THEIR CAR

02:11:21.907 --> 02:11:24.409
BREAK DOWN I'M NOT HAVING CHILD

02:11:24.476 --> 02:11:27.045
CARE -- HAVING A CHILD WHO'S

02:11:27.112 --> 02:11:28.280
STRUGGLING IN SCHOOL ARE

02:11:28.347 --> 02:11:29.381
STRUGGLING IN THE COMMUNITY

02:11:29.448 --> 02:11:30.515
WHICH REQUIRES THAT THEIR

02:11:30.582 --> 02:11:32.117
ATTENTION AS A PARENT ARE ALL

02:11:32.184 --> 02:11:33.952
THINGS THAT CAN SLOW DOWN THE

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:36.255
PATH OF A RECIPIENT.

02:11:36.321 --> 02:11:38.056
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE SEE MANY

02:11:38.123 --> 02:11:39.591
MANY FAMILIES AND ASSEMBLY

02:11:39.658 --> 02:11:41.026
MEMBER RUBIO AS WELL VERSED IN

02:11:41.093 --> 02:11:43.328
THE SUBJECT MATTER WE SEE SO

02:11:43.395 --> 02:11:44.863
MANY FAMILIES WHO HAVE

02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:45.597
EXPERIENCED.

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:48.066
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EITHER IN THE

02:11:48.133 --> 02:11:51.970
PAST OR CURRENTLY -- AND THESE --

02:11:52.037 --> 02:11:53.438
UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY OUR STATE

02:11:53.505 --> 02:11:55.574
RULES WORK RIGHT NOW IS YOU

02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:57.576
CAN'T GET A WAIVER -- FROM

02:11:57.643 --> 02:11:59.645
WELFARE TO WORK REQUIREMENTS IF

02:11:59.711 --> 02:12:01.179
YOU HAVE A SITUATION OF DOMESTIC

02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:02.447
VIOLENCE UNLESS YOU CAN

02:12:02.514 --> 02:12:05.417
DEMONSTRATE GOOD CAUSE FOR NOT

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:07.386
PARTICIPATING IN WELFARE TO WORK.

02:12:07.452 --> 02:12:08.720
SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT MEANS

02:12:08.787 --> 02:12:10.589
THE PEOPLE END UP RUNNING THEIR

02:12:10.656 --> 02:12:12.057
TIME CLOCKS TRYING.

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:13.959
TO MEET THE COUNTIES YOU KNOW

02:12:14.026 --> 02:12:15.260
WELFARE TO WORK PLAN THAT THERE

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:16.728
THE COUNTY IS REQUIRED TO

02:12:16.795 --> 02:12:19.131
PROVIDE IN THE MEANTIME THOSE

02:12:19.197 --> 02:12:21.066

02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:21.667
CLOCKS.

02:12:21.733 --> 02:12:23.869
SO FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:25.270
ARE ADVOCATING WE WOULD

02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:26.905

02:20:48.373 --> 02:20:50.708
WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE

02:20:50.775 --> 02:20:52.277
SOME EASY SOLUTIONS TO THESE

02:20:52.343 --> 02:20:53.378

IN TAYLOR TRANSFERRED TO STAGE --

02:21:19.804 --> 02:21:21.139
TWO IT WOULD END THE PRACTICE OF

02:21:21.206 --> 02:21:23.775
SHORT TERM AUTHORIZATIONS THAT

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.610
ARE TIED TO ACTIVITIES. TWELVE

02:21:25.677 --> 02:21:27.579

AND OUT OF CRISIS AND TOWARD

02:21:54.305 --> 02:21:55.673
STABILITY.

02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:56.207
THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHEN

02:21:56.274 --> 02:21:57.642
FAMILIES HAVE BARRIERS AND

02:21:57.709 --> 02:21:59.143
CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE

02:21:59.210 --> 02:22:01.479

SUPPORT.

02:22:07.285 --> 02:22:08.586
THE THIRD ELEMENT WOULD CREATE

02:22:08.653 --> 02:22:10.788
AN ONLINE READ ONLY SUMMARY

02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:12.557

02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:21.699
WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.

02:22:21.766 --> 02:22:23.201
THE SCREEN WOULD PROVIDE THE

02:22:23.268 --> 02:22:24.569
NINE DATA ELEMENTS NEEDED TO

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:26.905
ENROLL THE FAMILY INTO STAGE.

02:22:26.971 --> 02:22:28.406
TWO AND IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE

02:22:28.473 --> 02:22:29.807
THE LAST STATE OF CASH SHE'D

02:22:29.874 --> 02:22:31.309
RECEIVED.

02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:33.278
THIS FIX WAS CONCEIVED IN

02:22:33.344 --> 02:22:35.613
PARTNERSHIP WITH C. W. D. A.'S

PART OF THE CAL THE ASSET TEST

ITSELF THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT

02:30:46.837 --> 02:30:48.806
HAS BEEN ADJUSTED OVER THE LAST

02:30:48.873 --> 02:30:50.408
COUPLE OF YEARS IN THE BUDGET.

02:30:50.474 --> 02:30:53.010
AND IT ALSO HAS A COST OF LIVING

02:30:53.077 --> 02:30:55.646
INCREASE -- THE ASSET TEST WHICH

02:30:55.713 --> 02:30:57.448
MEANS THAT EVERY YEAR THAT THAT

02:30:57.515 --> 02:30:59.316
CALIFORNIA HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY

02:31:05.823 --> 02:31:07.391
TO ADJUSTED.

02:31:07.458 --> 02:31:08.559
SO YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF WELL

02:31:08.626 --> 02:31:09.393
HOW MANY CAO WORKS RECIPIENTS

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:10.928
CAN ACTUALLY SAVE THIS MUCH

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:12.430
MONEY YOU JUST HEARD.

02:31:12.496 --> 02:31:14.398
HOW LITTLE PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:15.733
ON IN THE TOWERS PROGRAM EVEN

02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:17.301
AFTER THE LARGEST INCREASE IN

02:31:17.368 --> 02:31:19.904
THEIR GRANTS -- IN OVER A DECADE

02:31:19.970 --> 02:31:21.872
TWO DECADES -- JUST HAPPENING

02:31:21.939 --> 02:31:23.641
THIS MONTH WHICH HURT AGAIN

02:31:23.707 --> 02:31:27.044
THRILLED AT THRILLED ABOUT -- IT

02:31:27.111 --> 02:31:28.546
AS YOU HEARD ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:31:28.612 --> 02:31:31.715
RUBIO SAY THERE'S STILL A TOO

02:31:31.782 --> 02:31:33.617
LITTLE TO IMAGINE LIVING OFF OF

02:31:33.684 --> 02:31:35.319
AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS.

02:31:35.386 --> 02:31:37.354
THAT RECIPIENTS A CAL WORKS ARE

02:31:37.421 --> 02:31:39.290
NOT SAVING MONEY AND THEY'RE

02:31:39.356 --> 02:31:41.559
BARELY GETTING BY -- BUT WHAT

02:31:41.625 --> 02:31:43.461
THIS ASSET TEST DOES IS IT KEEPS

02:31:43.527 --> 02:31:46.030

02:31:46.096 --> 02:31:47.898
PEOPLE APPLYING FOR BENEFITS --

02:31:47.965 --> 02:31:49.133
AND IT'S NOT A PERMANENT THERE

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:50.968
BY THE WAY WHAT WE SEE IS THAT

02:31:51.035 --> 02:31:52.603
WHEN FAMILIES COME IN AND APPLY

02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:54.071
FOR BENEFITS IF THEY HAVE ASSETS

02:31:54.138 --> 02:31:56.140
LET'S SAY THEY'VE LOST A JOB --

02:31:56.207 --> 02:31:57.308
THEY HAD A KNEE INJURY OR DEATH

02:31:57.374 --> 02:31:58.876
IN THE FAMILY A FAMILY

02:31:58.943 --> 02:32:00.377
SEPARATION OR SOME OTHER LIFE

02:32:00.444 --> 02:32:01.712
CHANGING EVENT AND THEY COME IN

02:32:01.779 --> 02:32:03.747
TO APPLY FOR BENEFITS TO HELP

02:32:03.814 --> 02:32:04.949
PAY THE RENT AND THE BASIC NEEDS.

02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:06.617
WHEN THEY GET THERE -- THEY

02:32:06.684 --> 02:32:09.386
LEARN ABOUT THE ASSET TEST AND

02:32:09.453 --> 02:32:10.955
AND WHAT THEY REALIZE IS IF THEY

02:32:11.021 --> 02:32:12.323
JUST GO HOME.

02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:13.958
AND SPEND DOWN THEIR ASSETS IF

02:32:14.024 --> 02:32:15.726
THEY'RE STILL POOR THEY CAN COME

02:32:15.793 --> 02:32:17.795
BACK IN AND APPLY IN FACT YOU

02:32:17.862 --> 02:32:18.762
SEE A KIND OF TURNING OF

02:32:18.829 --> 02:32:21.031
APPLICANTS -- PEOPLE COME IN A

02:32:21.098 --> 02:32:22.500

SAVINGS AMOUNT WHICH THAT

02:32:23.868 --> 02:32:25.503
THEY'VE THEY'VE WORKED REALLY

02:32:25.569 --> 02:32:26.804
HARD TO SAY.

02:32:26.871 --> 02:32:27.805
MANY PEOPLE HAVE WORKED FOR

02:32:27.872 --> 02:32:30.174
YEARS TO SAVE A THREE THOUSAND

02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:31.742
DOLLARS AND THEN TO BE TOLD THAT

02:32:31.809 --> 02:32:33.110
THEY HAVE TO SPEND THAT DOWN IN

02:32:33.177 --> 02:32:34.979
ORDER TO GET A LITTLE HELP WITH

02:32:35.045 --> 02:32:37.181
THE RENT -- IS.

02:32:37.248 --> 02:32:38.482
IT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO START THE

02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:40.251
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTY

02:32:40.317 --> 02:32:45.856

RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE IN SOME

02:32:48.225 --> 02:32:48.792
OF THE OTHER STATES WHERE THIS

02:32:48.859 --> 02:32:50.060
IS A REPEAL HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED

02:32:50.127 --> 02:32:52.897
LIKE ALABAMA AND LOUISIANA --

02:32:52.963 --> 02:32:55.766

02:32:55.833 --> 02:32:58.302
THE THE APPLICANT'S OF ACTUALLY

BE APPLIED TO EVERY APPLICANT.

02:33:06.477 --> 02:33:08.445
SO IT'S ALSO BURDEN FOR THE

02:33:08.512 --> 02:33:10.347

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:22.927
ACCOUNT.

02:33:22.993 --> 02:33:24.028
THE ONES THAT ARE CHALLENGE THE

02:33:24.094 --> 02:33:25.863
MOST TO DO THIS ARE ACTUALLY THE

THEN THEY HAVE TO PROVE THEY

02:33:28.232 --> 02:33:29.300
DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT.

02:33:29.366 --> 02:33:31.035
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY HARD

02:33:31.101 --> 02:33:32.469
TO DO IF YOU'VE EVER PROVEN YOU

02:33:32.536 --> 02:33:34.905

02:34:50.347 --> 02:34:52.149
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT IF WE

IN THE GRANT LEVELS OF THE

02:41:02.386 --> 02:41:04.187
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING WE DO THINK

02:41:04.254 --> 02:41:06.690
THAT THAT WILL ASSIST IN TRYING

02:41:06.757 --> 02:41:08.158
TO ALLOW SOME FAMILIES TO BE

02:41:08.225 --> 02:41:09.726
ABLE TO KEEP THEIR HOUSING MORE.

02:41:09.793 --> 02:41:11.228

WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASING

02:41:28.345 --> 02:41:29.746
NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING TO

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:32.149

WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET

02:41:47.130 --> 02:41:48.331
CHANGE FOR MANY YEARS.

02:41:48.398 --> 02:41:57.007
IS -- THE CURRENT LAW -- WE

02:41:57.074 --> 02:41:59.509
PERMITS THAT WE PROVIDE HOMELESS

I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT BECOMING A

02:56:42.058 --> 02:56:49.198

02:56:49.265 --> 02:56:50.733

DAUGHTER WAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND

02:56:56.339 --> 02:56:57.707
MY SON WAS TWENTY THREE MONTHS.

YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE

03:17:52.727 --> 03:17:54.229

STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND NOT ONLY

03:18:20.154 --> 03:18:21.856

ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM WE HAVE --

03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:14.622

03:22:14.689 --> 03:22:15.923
PERSISTENTLY LAGGED BEHIND THE

03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:17.058

LOWEST SENIOR PARTICIPATION RATE

ALSO CDSS COVERAGE HAS

03:22:43.084 --> 03:22:43.551
PARTICIPATED IN A FEDERAL

03:22:43.618 --> 03:22:45.152
DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM CALLED THE

ELDERLY SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION

03:22:47.555 --> 03:22:48.155

SAP A SINCE TWO THOUSAND

03:22:51.192 --> 03:22:51.692
SEVENTEEN AND WE COMMEND THE

03:22:51.759 --> 03:22:52.860
DEPARTMENTS LEADERSHIP AND

03:22:52.927 --> 03:22:53.995
GAINING FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR

03:22:54.061 --> 03:22:55.897
THIS PROJECT -- THERE WERE A

03:22:55.963 --> 03:22:57.698
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT

03:22:57.765 --> 03:22:58.332
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVEN

03:22:58.399 --> 03:22:59.934
HOUSEHOLDS IDENTIFIED AS EASE UP

03:23:00.001 --> 03:23:01.669

TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND ALL

03:23:02.336 --> 03:23:03.804
NEWLY APPLYING SENIOR DISABLED

POLICIES AND PROCESS SET IN

03:23:07.041 --> 03:23:08.709
PLACE BY THIS -- BUT BECAUSE THE

03:23:08.776 --> 03:23:12.213
FEDERAL PEOPLE WAS COST NEUTRAL

03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:13.514
WE HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED IS

03:23:13.581 --> 03:23:15.316
ACTUALLY A SIMPLIFIED USER

03:23:15.383 --> 03:23:17.351
FRIENDLY SENIOR APPLICATION --

03:23:17.418 --> 03:23:19.387
AND SO THIS IS A STATE OPTION WE

03:23:19.453 --> 03:23:20.855
DON'T NEED FURTHER A FEDERAL

03:23:20.922 --> 03:23:22.623
APPROVAL TO DO THIS WE JUST NEED

03:23:22.690 --> 03:23:25.493
THE FUNDS -- BUT WE ALSO KNOW

03:23:25.560 --> 03:23:26.827
THAT MOST OTHER EAST UP STATES

03:23:26.894 --> 03:23:27.795
HAVE IMPLEMENTED A SIMPLE

03:23:27.862 --> 03:23:29.830
APPLICATION WHICH IS ABOUT TWO

03:23:29.897 --> 03:23:31.165
TO EIGHT PAGES -- AND THIS IS IN

03:23:31.232 --> 03:23:32.700
CONTRAST TO OUR EXISTING CAL

03:23:32.767 --> 03:23:34.402
FRESH APPLICATION WHICH IS

03:23:34.468 --> 03:23:35.937
EIGHTEEN PAGES LONG AND CONTAINS

03:23:36.003 --> 03:23:37.104
MANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT

03:23:37.171 --> 03:23:40.541
RELEVANT TO THESE EASE UP

03:23:40.608 --> 03:23:41.142
HOUSEHOLDS.

03:23:41.208 --> 03:23:41.776
AND SO WE ARE RESPECTING A ONE

03:23:41.842 --> 03:23:42.843
TIME ALLOCATION TO IMPLEMENT A

03:23:42.910 --> 03:23:44.478
USER CENTERED SIMPLIFIED CAL

03:23:44.545 --> 03:23:46.514
FRESH APPLICATION -- THE COST

03:23:46.581 --> 03:23:48.015
ESTIMATE AN IDEA FOR THE PROJECT

03:23:48.082 --> 03:23:49.784
IS BASED ON EXISTING PROJECTS

03:23:49.850 --> 03:23:53.287
UNDER WAY -- THAT CDS US AND C.

03:23:53.354 --> 03:23:56.490
H. SS ARE IMPLEMENTING FOR USER

03:23:56.557 --> 03:23:57.925
CENTERED DESIGN PRINCIPLES IN

03:23:57.992 --> 03:23:58.893
APPLICATIONS AND RE

03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:00.428
CERTIFICATION FORMS AND WE WOULD

03:24:00.494 --> 03:24:01.963
HOPE THAT THIS REQUEST WOULD

03:24:02.029 --> 03:24:03.664
BUILD UPON ALL OF THOSE LESSONS

03:24:03.731 --> 03:24:04.365
LEARNED.

03:24:04.432 --> 03:24:05.266
THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

03:24:05.333 --> 03:24:07.234
COMPLETED AND THIS WOULD BE --

03:24:07.301 --> 03:24:08.502
NARROWING IN ON THE SENIOR

03:24:08.569 --> 03:24:10.805
POPULATION -- WITH THE EXPANSION

03:24:10.871 --> 03:24:12.106
OF CALIFORNIA'S TO THE SS I

03:24:12.173 --> 03:24:13.908
POPULATION THIS IS EXTREMELY

03:24:13.975 --> 03:24:15.810
TIMELY -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT A

03:24:15.876 --> 03:24:17.144
SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION IS NOT A

03:24:17.211 --> 03:24:18.646
PANACEA I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS

03:24:18.713 --> 03:24:20.214
IS GOING TO SOLVE OUR SENIOR

03:24:20.281 --> 03:24:21.882
ENROLLMENT CRISIS -- BUT AT THE

03:24:21.949 --> 03:24:23.484
SAME TIME WE NEED SORT OF AN ALL

03:24:23.551 --> 03:24:25.453
HANDS ON DECK APPROACH THAT WE

03:24:25.519 --> 03:24:26.988
ARE MATCHING BOTH POLICY AND

03:24:27.054 --> 03:24:28.956
PROCESS USED. TO GET THE MAXIMUM

03:24:29.023 --> 03:24:31.492
BENEFIT -- WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT

03:24:31.559 --> 03:24:32.193
SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH

03:24:32.259 --> 03:24:34.328
DISABILITIES DESERVE TO LIVE AN

03:24:34.395 --> 03:24:36.263
AGE WITH DIGNITY AND FREE FROM

HUNGER AND THIS IS ONE WAY WE

03:24:39.333 --> 03:24:39.533
CAN HELP.

03:24:39.600 --> 03:24:40.434
THANK YOU [inaudible]

I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE

03:24:44.872 --> 03:24:47.008
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL --

03:24:47.074 --> 03:24:48.009
SO CERTAINLY AT THE HIGHEST

03:24:48.075 --> 03:24:50.277
LEVEL WE SUPPORT A REDESIGN OF

03:24:50.344 --> 03:24:51.612
FORMS THAT THEY CAN BE MORE USER

03:24:51.679 --> 03:24:52.980
FRIENDLY -- THAT'S CERTAINLY

03:24:53.047 --> 03:24:54.115
SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT HAS

03:24:54.181 --> 03:24:55.783
WORK GROUPS ON FOR VARIOUS

03:24:55.850 --> 03:24:56.951
CLIENT NOTICES ARE MADE CARRIED

03:24:57.018 --> 03:24:57.852
REPORT.

03:24:57.918 --> 03:24:59.086
THE CHALLENGE REALLY IS AROUND

03:24:59.153 --> 03:25:01.088
TIMING AND COST -- SO

03:25:01.155 --> 03:25:02.690
IMPLEMENTATION OF SS I WILL BE

03:25:02.757 --> 03:25:04.592
IN ABOUT SIXTY DAYS -- SO WE

03:25:04.659 --> 03:25:06.227
WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THIS BY JUNE

03:25:06.293 --> 03:25:08.195
FIRST THIS YEAR BUT CERTAINLY A

03:25:08.262 --> 03:25:09.997
LOOK AT FRANKLY NOT JUST THE

03:25:10.064 --> 03:25:12.133
SENIOR APT BUT THE OVERALL

03:25:12.199 --> 03:25:13.534
APPLICATION.

03:25:13.601 --> 03:25:15.002
THE SENIOR AT THE FAMILY FACING

03:25:15.069 --> 03:25:18.539
APP THE REPORT NEEDS A A RE LOOK

03:25:18.606 --> 03:25:19.073
IN SOME OF THE WAYS OF THE

03:25:19.140 --> 03:25:22.076
HEALTH FORMS.

03:25:22.143 --> 03:25:24.679
OKAY SO -- CERTAINLY THE FORMS

03:25:24.745 --> 03:25:25.980
YOU NEED TO RE LOOK IN THE OTHER

03:25:26.047 --> 03:25:26.947
TWO KEY TIMING PIECE OF COURSE

03:25:27.014 --> 03:25:28.082
IS THE AUTOMATION IT'S ONE THING

03:25:28.149 --> 03:25:29.383
TO REDESIGN FORM BUT THEN IT

03:25:29.450 --> 03:25:31.085
NEEDS TO BE AUTOMATED SO GET TO

03:25:31.152 --> 03:25:32.486
THE PERSON WHO NEEDS THAT FORMER

03:25:32.553 --> 03:25:33.754
THAT APPLICATION.

03:25:33.821 --> 03:25:34.555
AND AS YOU KNOW OUR THREE

03:25:34.622 --> 03:25:36.023
SYSTEMS ARE IN A PROCESS OF A

03:25:36.090 --> 03:25:37.725
MIGRATION TO TWO TO ONE SO THE

03:25:37.792 --> 03:25:40.127
THINKING ABOUT THE TIMING.

03:25:40.194 --> 03:25:41.796
THE PROCESS TO DESIGN THE FORMS

03:25:41.862 --> 03:25:43.097
AS A SYSTEM IN THE PART AND THE

03:25:43.164 --> 03:25:45.533
TIMING TO AUTOMATE THEM REQUIRES

03:25:45.599 --> 03:25:46.567
A A GOOD.

03:25:46.634 --> 03:25:47.702
STAKEHOLDER PLAN WITH ALL

03:25:47.768 --> 03:25:50.738
PARTIES HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

03:25:50.805 --> 03:25:52.807
THIS THIS PIECE FITS INTO IT.

03:25:52.873 --> 03:25:53.374
SO OUR CONCERNS ARE REALLY

03:25:53.441 --> 03:25:54.475
PRACTICAL NOT TO KNOW --

03:25:54.542 --> 03:25:56.610
CONCEPTUAL CONCERNS THANK YOU

03:25:56.677 --> 03:25:59.113
LIKE SPEAKER.

03:25:59.180 --> 03:26:02.717
FROM THE FINANCE HELLO.

03:26:02.783 --> 03:26:04.852
I THINK MY FIRST QUESTION WAS IS

03:26:04.919 --> 03:26:05.953
ONE MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO DO

03:26:06.020 --> 03:26:07.555
THIS.

03:26:07.621 --> 03:26:09.090
AND I KNOW YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS

03:26:09.156 --> 03:26:11.025
WITH WITH STAFF ON THIS ALSO

03:26:11.092 --> 03:26:12.293
YEAH SO I THINK YOU KNOW FROM

03:26:12.359 --> 03:26:13.728
OUR UNDERSTANDING AND WORK IN

03:26:13.794 --> 03:26:15.529
THIS AREA FOR MANY YEARS A LOT

03:26:15.596 --> 03:26:18.099
OF THE COST IS THE AUTOMATION.

03:26:18.165 --> 03:26:19.934
AND SO THE DESIGN ITSELF IS THE

03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:21.235
AUTOMATION.

03:26:21.302 --> 03:26:22.937
AND SO THE DESIGN ITSELF YOU

03:26:23.003 --> 03:26:24.405
KNOW FROM OUR CONVERSATION WITH

03:26:24.472 --> 03:26:25.606
CONSULTANTS ANOTHER PROJECTS

03:26:25.673 --> 03:26:26.741
WOULD BE QUITE MINIMAL THIS

03:26:26.807 --> 03:26:28.008
COULD REALLY BUILD UPON LEARNING

03:26:28.075 --> 03:26:29.143
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE.

03:26:29.210 --> 03:26:32.179
I'M TALKING TO USERS AND HOW TO

03:26:32.246 --> 03:26:34.148
AUTOMATION COSTS WERE ESTIMATING

03:26:34.215 --> 03:26:36.283
AROUND A MILLION THAT TENDS TO

03:26:36.350 --> 03:26:38.586
BE -- A SIMILAR AUTOMATION COSTS

03:26:38.652 --> 03:26:39.687
BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S

03:26:39.754 --> 03:26:40.988
OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL AS

03:26:41.055 --> 03:26:42.990
ADVOCATES SO -- I WOULD LEAVE

03:26:43.057 --> 03:26:44.792
THAT UP TO INPUT FROM THE

03:26:44.859 --> 03:26:46.026
DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS IT'S ONE

03:26:46.093 --> 03:26:47.394
OF THE QUESTIONS DID HAVE TO DO

03:26:47.461 --> 03:26:48.362
WITH THE FACT THAT FOR THE

03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:51.432
NEARNESS -- OF THE JUNE FIRST

03:26:51.499 --> 03:26:55.002
EXPANSION OF A SOCIETY -- BUT

03:26:55.069 --> 03:26:56.771
YOU DON'T SEE THAT AS A

03:26:56.837 --> 03:26:57.905
POSSIBILITY.

03:26:57.972 --> 03:27:00.708
OF OF WHAT WOULD BE A TIME LINE

03:27:00.775 --> 03:27:04.945
THAT WOULD BE MORE.

03:27:05.012 --> 03:27:06.080
WELL WE'RE EIGHTEEN MY WORKABLE.

03:27:06.147 --> 03:27:07.848
TRACY WELL KNOWS WHERE AT LEAST

03:27:07.915 --> 03:27:11.018
EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO REDESIGNING

03:27:11.085 --> 03:27:12.052
THE EVERITT MID CARRIED REPORT.

03:27:12.119 --> 03:27:14.188
SO A COUPLE TWO TO THREE YEARS

03:27:14.255 --> 03:27:15.856
AND THEN THE CROSSWALK WITH THE

03:27:15.923 --> 03:27:17.658
MIGRATION -- GIVEN THE WE'RE

03:27:17.725 --> 03:27:19.260
MOVING FROM THREE TO TWO TO ONE

03:27:19.326 --> 03:27:21.128
SYSTEM WHAT'S THE MOST STRATEGIC

03:27:21.195 --> 03:27:23.497
AND COST EFFECTIVE TIME NOT

03:27:23.564 --> 03:27:24.098
WANTING TO WASTE TIME TO GET

03:27:24.165 --> 03:27:26.133
THIS -- INCREASE SERVICE TO

03:27:26.200 --> 03:27:26.634
SENIORS BUT ALSO BEING

03:27:26.700 --> 03:27:28.602
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHEN IT SHOULD

03:27:28.669 --> 03:27:29.170
INTERSECT WITH THE MIGRATION

03:27:29.236 --> 03:27:31.372
PLAN.

03:27:31.438 --> 03:27:32.339
YEAH AND THEY WILL OUT I THINK

03:27:32.406 --> 03:27:33.808
YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS WE'RE TRYING

03:27:33.874 --> 03:27:35.409
TO GET READY FOR THE JUNE ONE

03:27:35.476 --> 03:27:37.344
ENROLLMENT THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT

03:27:37.411 --> 03:27:38.379
THE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE

03:27:38.445 --> 03:27:39.680
POPULATION THAT'S WHERE

03:27:39.747 --> 03:27:42.149
PARTICIPATION RATE IS STILL

03:27:42.216 --> 03:27:43.884
NINETEEN POINT 5% AND SO.

HOUSEHOLDS ON CALPERS ARE STILL

03:46:54.033 --> 03:46:55.368

04:05:22.340 --> 04:05:23.108
QUESTIONS I BELIEVE YOU'VE

04:05:23.175 --> 04:05:30.248
ALREADY COVERED THEM

04:05:30.315 --> 04:05:30.549
[inaudible]

04:05:30.615 --> 04:05:35.020
SONOMA [inaudible]

04:05:35.087 --> 04:05:39.458
CAN YOU. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS --

04:05:39.524 --> 04:05:41.693
COULD DSS WORK WITH ANOTHER

04:05:41.760 --> 04:05:43.462
AGENCY IF NECESSARY THROUGH

04:05:43.528 --> 04:05:47.499
INTER DEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION.

04:05:47.566 --> 04:05:49.301
SYDNEY TEMAT APARTMENT FINANCE

04:05:49.367 --> 04:05:51.169
WE BELIEVE THE RESERVE AS AS

04:05:51.236 --> 04:05:53.305
IT'S CURRENTLY PROPOSES UNLESS

04:05:53.371 --> 04:05:54.773
TIME EFFICIENT MECHANISM.

04:05:54.840 --> 04:05:57.175
SO AND TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO

04:05:57.242 --> 04:05:59.077
THESE EMERGENT SITUATIONS WITH

04:05:59.144 --> 04:06:00.412
THE UNDERSTANDING WE MAY NOT

04:06:00.479 --> 04:06:02.447
KNOW WHICH STATE AGENCY WOULD BE

04:06:02.514 --> 04:06:05.717
THE MOST APPROPRIATE TO RESPOND

04:06:05.784 --> 04:06:06.651
TO WHAT SITUATION MAY ARISE.

04:06:06.718 --> 04:06:07.819
SO WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT BY

04:06:07.886 --> 04:06:10.021
HAVING THE FUNDING AND A RESERVE

04:06:10.088 --> 04:06:11.556
RATHER THAN AS A PART OF A

04:06:11.623 --> 04:06:13.058
DEPARTMENTS BUDGET.

04:06:13.125 --> 04:06:14.025
THAT ENABLES US TO HAVE

04:06:14.092 --> 04:06:16.228
ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND TO BE

04:06:16.294 --> 04:06:17.562
ABLE TO REACT IN A MUCH MORE

04:06:17.629 --> 04:06:19.297
TIME EFFICIENT WAY THAN ROUTING

04:06:19.364 --> 04:06:20.599
THROUGH AN INTER AGENCY

04:06:20.665 --> 04:06:22.567
AGREEMENT WHICH CAN BE A LENGTHY

04:06:22.634 --> 04:06:24.402
PROCESS.

04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:27.372

IMMIGRANTS.

04:07:39.244 --> 04:07:40.545
WERE HOME TO THE MOST ACTIVE

04:07:40.612 --> 04:07:42.280
BORDER CROSSING IN THE WORLD.

04:07:42.347 --> 04:07:43.548
AND HOME TO MORE IMMIGRANTS THAN

04:07:43.615 --> 04:07:45.817
ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY.

04:07:45.884 --> 04:07:47.185
AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

04:07:47.252 --> 04:07:48.787
WORD FOR THE COMMITTEE TODAY.

04:07:48.853 --> 04:07:50.655
THIS IS OUR HOME.

04:07:50.722 --> 04:07:51.790
IMMIGRANTS READ THE STATE ARE

04:07:51.856 --> 04:07:53.458
VULNERABLE TO ARBITRARY ARRESTS

04:07:53.525 --> 04:07:54.626
INHUMANE DETENTION AND

04:07:54.693 --> 04:07:57.028
DEPORTATION WITHOUT DUE PROCESS.

04:07:57.095 --> 04:07:58.697
IMMIGRATION IS ONE OF THE MOST

04:07:58.763 --> 04:08:00.565
COMPLEX AREAS OF THE LAW.

04:08:00.632 --> 04:08:02.167
AND I'VE EVER EVOLVING.

04:08:02.234 --> 04:08:02.901
BUT THOSE IMMIGRANTS WHO FACE

04:08:02.968 --> 04:08:04.669
DEPORTATION ARE NOT GUARANTEED

04:08:04.736 --> 04:08:06.037
ACCESS TO COUNSEL THE

04:08:06.104 --> 04:08:07.939
CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CASES CAN

04:08:08.006 --> 04:08:09.574
BE YEARS AND THE TENSION FAMILY

04:08:09.641 --> 04:08:11.776
SEPARATION AND EXILE FROM THIS

04:08:11.843 --> 04:08:12.510
COUNTRY.

04:08:12.577 --> 04:08:13.778
THE NEED FOR LEGAL SERVICES

04:08:13.845 --> 04:08:15.680
INFRASTRUCTURE IS MORE URGENT IN

04:08:15.747 --> 04:08:17.182
THE RURAL REGIONS OF OUR STATE.

04:08:17.249 --> 04:08:18.350
THOSE PLACES INCLUDE BRIDGES

04:08:18.416 --> 04:08:19.818
LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE

04:08:19.884 --> 04:08:21.419
CENTRAL CLOSE.

04:08:21.486 --> 04:08:22.254
THESE ARE HOME ALSO TO THE

04:08:22.320 --> 04:08:23.655
HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF

04:08:23.722 --> 04:08:25.156
VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS AND WHERE

04:08:27.459 --> 04:08:29.394
ACTIONS ARE MOST AGGRESSIVE.

04:08:29.461 --> 04:08:31.162
AND TO DEFEND OUR COMMUNITIES WE

04:08:31.229 --> 04:08:32.530
MUST RECOGNIZE THAT IMMIGRATION

04:08:32.597 --> 04:08:34.099
COURT ROOMS IN THIS COUNTRY

04:08:34.165 --> 04:08:35.567
WHERE TODAY SO MANY OF

04:08:35.634 --> 04:08:37.269
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STANDALONE

04:08:37.335 --> 04:08:38.937
ARE TRULY THE FRONT LINES OF

04:08:39.004 --> 04:08:40.905
THIS BATTLE.

04:08:40.972 --> 04:08:41.840
THE ONE TIME US THAT WE ARE

04:08:41.906 --> 04:08:43.508
MAKING IS FOR FOUR POINT SEVEN

04:08:43.575 --> 04:08:45.243
MILLION DOLLARS FOR A PILOT

04:08:45.310 --> 04:08:46.845
PROGRAM CALLED THE CALIFORNIA

04:08:46.911 --> 04:08:48.947
IMMIGRANT JUSTICE FELLOWSHIP.

04:08:49.014 --> 04:08:50.215
IT WOULD PROVIDE THE FIRST STATE

04:08:50.282 --> 04:08:52.617
SPONSORED FELLOW FELLOW PROGRAM

04:08:52.684 --> 04:08:53.785
TO INCREASE REMOVAL DEFENSE

04:08:53.852 --> 04:08:55.987
REPRESENTATION FOR OUR RESIDENTS.

04:08:56.054 --> 04:08:57.055
IT WOULD INCREASE WORKFORCE

04:08:57.122 --> 04:08:58.590
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAW STUDENTS

04:08:58.657 --> 04:09:00.191

WORK IN THESE REGIONS OF HIGH

04:09:02.927 --> 04:09:05.163
NEEDS BUT HAVE NO VIABLE OPTIONS

04:09:05.230 --> 04:09:06.765
FOR DOING SO.

04:09:06.831 --> 04:09:08.233
FINALLY IT WOULD EXPAND THE

04:09:08.300 --> 04:09:09.701
NUMBER OF REPUTABLE LEGAL

04:09:09.768 --> 04:09:11.836
SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ELIGIBLE

04:09:11.903 --> 04:09:12.771
TO PROVIDE THESE CRITICAL

04:09:12.837 --> 04:09:14.472
SERVICE AND IN THESE REGIONS

04:09:14.539 --> 04:09:16.041
WERE IMMIGRATION FRIED AND THE

04:09:16.107 --> 04:09:17.475
THOUGHT HE WAS ARE RAMPANT THIS

04:09:17.542 --> 04:09:21.112
SERVICE COULD NOT BE MORE NEEDED.

04:09:21.179 --> 04:09:21.980
TODAY YOU WILL HEAR FROM

04:09:22.047 --> 04:09:23.615
ORGANIZATIONS WERE EAGER TO LAND

04:09:23.682 --> 04:09:25.417
THE SUPPORT TO THIS EFFORT AND I

04:09:25.483 --> 04:09:26.785
HAVE TO SAY AS A DEPORTATION

04:09:26.851 --> 04:09:27.819
DEFENSE ATTORNEY WHO'S BEEN

04:09:27.886 --> 04:09:29.554
PRACTICING IN THIS AREA FOR TEN

04:09:29.621 --> 04:09:30.822
YEARS.

04:09:30.889 --> 04:09:32.757
IT'S REALLY INSPIRING TO LOOK

04:09:32.824 --> 04:09:33.925
AROUND AND SEE THE PEOPLE THAT

04:09:33.992 --> 04:09:35.827
ARE IN THIS ROOM HERE -- WITH ME

04:09:35.894 --> 04:09:36.494
TODAY.

04:09:36.561 --> 04:09:38.530
SOME OF THEM TRAINED ME WHEN I

04:09:38.596 --> 04:09:41.099
WAS A LAW STUDENT AND THERE WAS

04:09:41.166 --> 04:09:43.134
HALF OF AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY.

04:09:43.201 --> 04:09:43.735
AT AN ORGANIZATION IN THE BAY

04:09:43.802 --> 04:09:45.937
AREA TO DATE THAT ORGANIZATION

04:09:46.004 --> 04:09:46.971
WHICH IS A FORMER EMPLOYER

04:09:47.038 --> 04:09:49.841
EMPLOYER OF MINE HAS.

04:09:49.908 --> 04:09:51.242
FORTY FIVE STAFF DEDICATED TO

04:09:51.309 --> 04:09:52.610
IMMIGRATION.

04:09:52.677 --> 04:09:54.479
AND THAT'S IN TEN YEARS AND I

04:09:54.546 --> 04:09:55.914
BELIEVE THAT IF WE INVEST IN A

04:09:55.980 --> 04:09:57.482
PROGRAM LIKE THIS THAT CAN BE IN

04:09:57.549 --> 04:09:58.983
A A REALITY IN ALL OF THESE

04:09:59.050 --> 04:10:01.119
UNDERSERVED REGIONS OF OUR STATE.

04:10:01.186 --> 04:10:01.953
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE

04:10:02.020 --> 04:10:03.655
ARE HERE FROM THESE REGIONS CAN

04:10:03.722 --> 04:10:05.924
BEST SPEAK TO THE NEEDS -- BUT I

04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:07.225
THINK THE MOST INSPIRING THING

04:10:07.292 --> 04:10:08.326
IS THAT WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER

04:10:08.393 --> 04:10:09.728
IN PARTNERSHIP.

04:10:09.794 --> 04:10:10.962
AND THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS

04:10:11.029 --> 04:10:12.263
REALLY BEEN WRITTEN BY PEOPLE

04:10:12.330 --> 04:10:13.665
WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING

04:10:13.732 --> 04:10:15.934
ON THE GROUND -- BOTH FROM THE

04:10:16.000 --> 04:10:17.168
LEGAL SIDE AND THE COMMUNITY

04:10:17.235 --> 04:10:19.604
SITE AND ARE READY TO EXECUTE

04:10:19.671 --> 04:10:21.272
SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE I

04:10:21.339 --> 04:10:22.340
THINK CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MAKE

04:10:22.407 --> 04:10:23.575
THIS INVESTMENT.

04:10:23.641 --> 04:10:25.043
AND WE NEED TO BE A LEADER IN

04:10:25.110 --> 04:10:27.112
THIS AREA WE ALREADY ARE BY THE

04:10:27.178 --> 04:10:28.246
GENEROUS INVESTMENT THAT'S BEEN

04:10:28.313 --> 04:10:29.681
MADE A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT

04:10:29.748 --> 04:10:31.182
FRANKLY THOSE DOLLARS ARE NOT

04:10:31.249 --> 04:10:32.684
FLOWING TO THESE REGIONS.

04:10:32.751 --> 04:10:34.219
AND SO THAT IS WHERE THE SPIRIT

04:10:34.285 --> 04:10:35.620
OF THIS PROPOSAL IS COMING FROM

04:10:35.687 --> 04:10:36.955

SERVICES.

04:12:12.717 --> 04:12:16.554
ARE WE ALSO A QUITTING HIS THE

04:12:16.621 --> 04:12:18.656
LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE NOT

04:12:18.723 --> 04:12:20.358
FUNDED THE COURTS.

04:12:20.425 --> 04:12:22.660
AN APPROPRIATE FASHION TO CATCH

04:12:22.727 --> 04:12:23.161
UP WITH THE DEMAND I'VE

04:12:23.228 --> 04:12:24.395
CONSTITUENTS.

04:12:24.462 --> 04:12:26.164
THAT THE WINDOWS CLOSED AT LIKE

04:12:26.231 --> 04:12:26.698
ONE OR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE

04:12:26.764 --> 04:12:27.799
AFTERNOON.

04:12:27.866 --> 04:12:30.268
AND ALSO THE COURTS ARE IMPACTED

04:12:30.335 --> 04:12:35.240
AS OF THE DEMAND -- ARE WE SURE

04:12:35.306 --> 04:12:36.207
THAT.

04:12:36.274 --> 04:12:38.142
AS A PARALLEL THAT WE SHOULD BE

04:12:38.209 --> 04:12:39.711
FOR FUNDING THE COURTS IN AN

04:12:39.777 --> 04:12:40.879
APPROPRIATE MANNER SO THAT.

04:12:40.945 --> 04:12:44.516
INDIVIDUALS CAN GET A TIMELY.

04:12:44.582 --> 04:12:46.584
A JUDICIAL REVIEW OR WHATEVER

04:12:46.651 --> 04:12:48.653
WHATEVER THE PROCESS IS --

04:12:48.720 --> 04:12:52.190
BECAUSE MY JUDGES IN MY DISTRICT.

04:12:52.257 --> 04:12:53.992
ARE SAYING THE BILL THE FUNDING

04:12:54.058 --> 04:12:56.361
IS IS A SHORTFALL IN THAT AREA

04:12:56.427 --> 04:12:57.128
TOO AND WE CAN HAVE MORE OF

04:12:57.195 --> 04:12:59.497
LEGALLY LEGAL REPRESENTATION.

04:12:59.564 --> 04:13:03.301
FOR NOT GETTING THEM A TIMELY --

04:13:03.368 --> 04:13:05.403
SAYS SEND.

04:13:05.470 --> 04:13:08.773
THE REPRESENTED BITTER HILL IT'S

04:13:08.840 --> 04:13:10.074
HIS FOR NOT.

04:13:10.141 --> 04:13:11.910
SO IS IT HAVE YOU CHECKED IN TO

04:13:11.976 --> 04:13:14.746
MAKE SURE OF WITH THE COURTS.

04:13:14.812 --> 04:13:15.146
THAT.

04:13:15.213 --> 04:13:17.682
WE PUT MORE LOAD ON THEM WITH

04:13:17.749 --> 04:13:19.751
MORE LEGAL REPRESENTATION THAT

04:13:19.817 --> 04:13:21.586
THEY CAN ACTUALLY.

04:13:21.653 --> 04:13:23.021
ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE'RE TRYING.

04:13:23.087 --> 04:13:24.789
TO TRYING TO GET NOW AND AGAIN I

04:13:24.856 --> 04:13:26.524
WANT THIS TO HAPPEN SURE I MEAN

04:13:26.591 --> 04:13:27.659
I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT IT'S

04:13:27.725 --> 04:13:29.093
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE'S PURVIEW

04:13:29.160 --> 04:13:30.695
TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE COURTS

04:13:30.762 --> 04:13:32.497
BECAUSE THE FEDERAL.

04:13:32.564 --> 04:13:34.465
IT'S A FEDERAL COURT -- I I

04:13:34.532 --> 04:13:36.134
BELIEVE THAT THAT AGENCY HAS

04:13:36.200 --> 04:13:37.569
SUFFICIENT FUNDING I MEAN THEY

04:13:37.635 --> 04:13:39.003
THEY THEY NEED MORE ASSISTANCE

04:13:39.070 --> 04:13:40.972
BUT I THINK -- THE COURTS ARE

04:13:41.039 --> 04:13:42.807
OPERATING THEIR DEPORTING PEOPLE --

04:13:42.874 --> 04:13:45.877
AND THE ISSUE IS NOT -- THAT.

04:13:45.944 --> 04:13:47.345
THAT THEY NEED MORE FUNDING --

04:13:47.412 --> 04:13:49.447
BUT FRANKLY AND IF THAT WERE THE

04:13:49.514 --> 04:13:50.048
ISSUED IT WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF

04:13:50.114 --> 04:13:51.115
THE STATE'S.

04:13:51.182 --> 04:13:53.117
JURISDICTION IN PRAGUE IT'D TO

04:13:53.184 --> 04:13:53.851
TO FIND A FEDERAL COURT

04:13:53.918 --> 04:13:54.152
[inaudible]

04:13:54.218 --> 04:13:55.453
DOES THAT.

04:13:55.520 --> 04:14:02.427
GOOD ENOUGH TO GET. ONE OF THE

04:14:02.493 --> 04:14:06.331
AREAS -- THE STATISTICS THAT ARE

04:14:06.397 --> 04:14:07.932
NOTED WOULD YOU PLEASE SHARE

04:14:07.999 --> 04:14:09.901
THOSE WITH US.

04:14:09.968 --> 04:14:12.303
ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE REPRESENTED

04:14:12.370 --> 04:14:16.574
AND THE MORE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS --

04:14:16.641 --> 04:14:19.043
BEING SUCCESSFUL.

04:14:19.110 --> 04:14:21.179
IN IN STOPPING A DEPORTATION

04:14:21.245 --> 04:14:22.347
WHETHER YOU'RE REPRESENTED OR

04:14:22.413 --> 04:14:24.682
NOT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE --

04:14:24.749 --> 04:14:25.516
THE A MAKES A DRAMATIC

04:14:25.583 --> 04:14:27.285
DIFFERENCE -- IT'S FIVE YOUR

04:14:27.352 --> 04:14:28.519
FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO WIN

04:14:28.586 --> 04:14:30.154
YOUR CASE IF YOU'RE REPRESENTED

04:14:30.221 --> 04:14:32.824
BY AN ATTORNEY -- AND THAT'S FOR

04:14:32.890 --> 04:14:34.993
THE NONCE TEEN POPULATION --

04:14:35.059 --> 04:14:36.794
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DETAINED I

04:14:36.861 --> 04:14:38.663
THINK HISTORICALLY NATIONALLY

04:14:38.730 --> 04:14:39.764
ARE.

04:14:39.831 --> 04:14:42.233
GET ACCESS TO COUNSELING MAY BE.

04:14:42.300 --> 04:14:45.069
IT'S BURIED BETWEEN TEN AND 30% --

04:14:45.136 --> 04:14:46.537
UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT'S

04:14:46.604 --> 04:14:49.841
CLOSER 215% NATIONALLY AND WHAT

04:14:49.907 --> 04:14:50.908
CALIFORNIA LEADS IN A LOT OF

04:14:50.975 --> 04:14:53.111
WAYS -- THE STATISTICS ARE NOT

04:14:53.177 --> 04:14:55.213
MUCH BETTER IN CALIFORNIA.

04:14:55.279 --> 04:14:57.015
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A LACK

04:14:57.081 --> 04:14:58.516
OF INTEREST I THINK -- AS

04:14:58.583 --> 04:14:59.651
MYSTERIES NOTED IT'S A VERY

04:14:59.717 --> 04:15:01.052
COMPLEX AREA OF LAW AND ONE THAT

04:15:01.119 --> 04:15:02.520
HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN VERY

04:15:02.587 --> 04:15:04.188
CHALLENGING FOR NON PROFITS --

04:15:04.255 --> 04:15:07.558
TO ENGAGE AND IN THE IN THE

04:15:07.625 --> 04:15:08.893
EARLIER COMICS MYSTERIES I

04:15:08.960 --> 04:15:10.061
APPRECIATED THAT YOU WERE

04:15:10.128 --> 04:15:11.329
TALKING ABOUT IT WAS IN THE

04:15:11.396 --> 04:15:12.397
EARLIER ISSUE.

04:15:12.463 --> 04:15:13.965
BUT EXPANDING INTO THE INLAND

04:15:14.032 --> 04:15:16.100
EMPIRE AND I THINK WHEN I LOOK

04:15:16.167 --> 04:15:19.003
AT A A A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS.

04:15:19.070 --> 04:15:22.306
I LOVE IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

04:15:22.373 --> 04:15:24.942
IT'S GOING TO SERVE.

04:15:25.009 --> 04:15:27.879
SO MANY PEOPLE -- AND IT'S

04:15:27.945 --> 04:15:29.647
REALLY IMPORTANT AND OF COURSE

04:15:29.714 --> 04:15:30.915
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THAT I

04:15:30.982 --> 04:15:32.550
WOULD ADVOCATE.

04:15:32.617 --> 04:15:34.052
FOR BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU

04:15:34.118 --> 04:15:35.586
THAT THE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE.

04:15:35.653 --> 04:15:37.121
WE NEED THIS.

04:15:37.188 --> 04:15:38.756
TO WE DON'T HAVE A LAW SCHOOL SO

04:15:38.823 --> 04:15:42.627
WE DON'T HAVE A THE PERFECT FEED

04:15:42.694 --> 04:15:44.262
FOR FOR SUCH A PILOT PROJECT.

04:15:44.328 --> 04:15:45.863
WE HAVE LAW SCHOOLS IN LOS

04:15:45.930 --> 04:15:46.931
ANGELES.

04:15:46.998 --> 04:15:48.332
BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T BE THE SAME

04:15:48.399 --> 04:15:50.034
I SEE ONE OF THE ADVOCATES FROM

04:15:50.101 --> 04:15:51.636
SHE LINED CERTAINLY WE WOULD

04:15:51.703 --> 04:15:53.471
WORK WITH THEM TO SEE WHAT WE

04:15:53.538 --> 04:15:56.808
CAN DO BUT EIGHT THE THE THESE

04:15:56.874 --> 04:15:58.142
PILOT PROJECTS.

04:15:58.209 --> 04:15:59.977
ARE IMPORTANT BUT I'D LIKE TO

04:16:00.044 --> 04:16:02.947
SEE HOW WE EXPAND THEM -- OF

04:16:03.014 --> 04:16:04.782
COURSE IT'LL COST MORE MONEY BUT

04:16:04.849 --> 04:16:06.718
TO EXPAND INTO OTHER AREAS LIKE

04:16:06.784 --> 04:16:08.119
THE INLAND EMPIRE.

04:16:08.186 --> 04:16:09.287
ONLY BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO BE

04:16:09.353 --> 04:16:10.888
THE ONE SITTING HERE BUT MY

04:16:14.392 --> 04:16:14.892
WELL.

04:16:14.959 --> 04:16:17.695

04:16:17.762 --> 04:16:19.030
ONE AREA.

04:16:19.097 --> 04:16:20.798

04:16:36.214 --> 04:16:37.348
AS FAR NORTH AS THE OREGON

THINK OF AS A REGIONAL FOOD BANK

05:24:19.506 --> 05:24:21.141
BUT FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT

05:24:21.208 --> 05:24:22.643
FOOD.

05:24:22.709 --> 05:24:24.311
A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY WOULD BE

05:24:24.378 --> 05:24:25.913

WELL.

05:24:39.159 --> 05:24:40.994
IS EXACTLY HOW WE TREATED HUNGER

05:24:41.061 --> 05:24:42.930
IN THE UNITED STATES WAS JUST

05:24:42.996 --> 05:24:44.398
VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS.

05:24:44.464 --> 05:24:46.266

FORMER BUSINESSMAN IN PHOENIX

05:24:47.835 --> 05:24:49.703
ARIZONA THOUGHT WELL WHAT IF WE

05:24:49.770 --> 05:24:51.572
CENTRALIZED ALL OF THIS GIVING

05:24:51.638 --> 05:24:53.707
FROM FARMERS AND FOOD PRODUCERS

05:24:53.774 --> 05:24:55.209
INTO ONE CENTRAL HUB.

05:24:55.275 --> 05:24:56.910
IN PUT ALL THOSE RESOURCES OUT

05:24:56.977 --> 05:24:58.212

AND PROVIDING THEM WITH

05:25:06.920 --> 05:25:08.422
GROCERIES TO ALLEVIATE HUNGER.

05:25:08.488 --> 05:25:10.357
IT WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN

05:25:10.424 --> 05:25:11.658
TEN YEARS LATER THE UNITED

05:25:11.725 --> 05:25:13.093
STATES WAS FUNDING EIGHTEEN

05:25:13.160 --> 05:25:15.796
REGIONAL FOOD BANKS ACROSS THE

05:25:15.863 --> 05:25:16.763
UNITED STATES.

05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:18.265
WE ARE QUITE SIMILAR TO THAT WE

05:25:18.332 --> 05:25:20.100
ARE NO WHERE NEAR THAT SCALE

05:25:20.167 --> 05:25:21.935
WE'RE VERY HUMBLING COMPARISON.

05:25:22.002 --> 05:25:23.704
BUT WE DO WORK WITH FOUR HUNDRED

05:25:23.770 --> 05:25:24.905

WE TAKE THESE MATERIALS AND SEND

05:25:52.699 --> 05:25:54.768
THEM OUT THROUGH EXISTING PUBLIC

05:25:54.835 --> 05:25:56.270

05:25:56.336 --> 05:25:58.538
PATHWAYS OUT OF POVERTY FOR

05:25:58.605 --> 05:26:00.474
THESE PEOPLE. TO IMPROVE THEIR

05:26:00.540 --> 05:26:02.009
RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAVE ALSO TO

05:26:02.075 --> 05:26:04.077
PROVIDE THEM WITH THE BASIC NEED

05:26:04.144 --> 05:26:06.179
THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED AN

05:26:06.246 --> 05:26:08.649
OTHERWISE WILL LIKELY GO WITHOUT.

05:26:08.715 --> 05:26:09.716
WE'VE HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE

05:26:09.783 --> 05:26:11.018
OVER THE YEARS SEVERAL EFFORTS

05:26:11.084 --> 05:26:12.185
AROUND MANY OF WHICH WE ARE VERY

05:26:12.252 --> 05:26:13.854
PROUD TO SUPPORT AROUND DIAPER

05:26:13.921 --> 05:26:14.588
NEED.

05:26:14.655 --> 05:26:17.457
IS WELL AS MANY OTHER -- VERY

05:26:17.524 --> 05:26:18.892
MERITORIOUS EFFORTS WHERE I'D

05:26:18.959 --> 05:26:20.761
MET OUR HUMBLE IN COMPARISON TO

05:26:20.827 --> 05:26:22.396
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE

05:26:22.462 --> 05:26:24.097
HEARD TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY.

05:26:24.164 --> 05:26:26.166
BUT VERY IMPORTANT. TWO WEEKS

05:26:26.233 --> 05:26:27.501
AGO MY STAFF AND I WERE IN

05:26:27.567 --> 05:26:29.903
WASHINGTON DC AND ONE OF MY

05:26:29.970 --> 05:26:31.271
STAFF MEMBERS WHO IS HERE TODAY

05:26:31.338 --> 05:26:32.739
PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL

05:26:32.806 --> 05:26:34.007

05:26:34.074 --> 05:26:35.642
LOBBY DAY ALONG WITH SOME OF THE

05:26:35.709 --> 05:26:36.243
OTHER ADVOCATES YOU'VE HEARD

05:26:36.310 --> 05:26:37.244
TODAY.

05:26:37.311 --> 05:26:38.845
IN I THINK THEY SAY IT BEST WHEN

05:26:38.912 --> 05:26:40.681
THEY SAY THAT BASIC NEEDS ARE

05:26:40.747 --> 05:26:41.882
NOT BASIC.

05:26:41.949 --> 05:26:43.250
IMAGINE GOING THROUGH YOUR DAY

05:26:43.317 --> 05:26:45.152
WITHOUT HAVING SHAMPOO OR

05:26:45.218 --> 05:26:46.920
DEODORANT OR DENTAL HYGIENE KIT

05:26:46.987 --> 05:26:48.221
OR BEING A KID IN SCHOOL ABOUT

05:26:48.288 --> 05:26:49.756
SCHOOL SUPPLIES WERE BEING A

05:26:49.823 --> 05:26:53.060
MOTHER WHO CAN'T PROVIDE DIAPERS

05:26:53.126 --> 05:26:54.461
FOR HER BABY.

05:26:54.528 --> 05:26:55.128
THESE ARE ALL THE STRUGGLES THAT

05:26:55.195 --> 05:26:57.197
THEY FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY.

05:26:57.264 --> 05:26:58.565
BUT WE'RE DOING IT THE SAME WAY

05:26:58.632 --> 05:27:00.968
WE DID IT WITH FOOD FIFTY YEARS

05:27:01.034 --> 05:27:02.803
AGO BUT WE CAN DO BETTER.

05:27:02.869 --> 05:27:03.670
SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS

05:27:03.737 --> 05:27:04.871
INITIALLY WAS SCHOOL SUPPLIES

05:27:04.938 --> 05:27:06.907
AND HYGIENE KITS WE'VE EXPANDED

05:27:06.974 --> 05:27:09.743
WE'VE CREATED -- THE BABY BRAND

05:27:09.810 --> 05:27:11.078
WITH OUR OUR STATE CHILDREN

05:27:11.144 --> 05:27:12.779
FAMILIES COMMISSION A LOT OF THE

05:27:12.846 --> 05:27:14.281
LOCAL AFFILIATES BUT WE ALSO

05:27:14.348 --> 05:27:15.983
MANUFACTURE STATIONARY AND

05:27:16.049 --> 05:27:18.318
HYGIENE ITEMS AND LAPTOPS.

05:27:18.385 --> 05:27:19.720
FOR OUR CLIENTS IN SCHOOLS AND

05:27:19.786 --> 05:27:21.388
ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE

05:27:21.455 --> 05:27:23.256
REALLY QUITE FUNDING CREATIVE

05:27:23.323 --> 05:27:23.824
YOU LEARN A LOT.

05:27:23.890 --> 05:27:26.994
BUT IT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT

05:27:27.060 --> 05:27:28.195
IS NEEDED IS A CENTRALIZED

05:27:28.261 --> 05:27:29.963
FACILITY AND THIS ISN'T MY

05:27:30.030 --> 05:27:32.366
CONCLUSION WE PUT TOGETHER.

05:27:32.432 --> 05:27:33.700
A PANEL OF EXPERTS THAT INCLUDED

05:27:33.767 --> 05:27:35.002
REPRESENTATIVES OF SOCIAL

05:27:35.068 --> 05:27:36.370
SERVICE AGENCIES COUNTY

05:27:36.436 --> 05:27:37.471
SUPERVISORS.

05:27:37.537 --> 05:27:39.239
PHILANTHROPIC LEADERS FROM

05:27:39.306 --> 05:27:40.807
THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

05:27:40.874 --> 05:27:42.609
IS WELL AS LOGISTICS EXPERTS

05:27:42.676 --> 05:27:44.277
BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG PART OF

05:27:44.344 --> 05:27:45.479
WHAT THIS IS.

05:27:45.545 --> 05:27:47.614
AND JUST LIKE IT WAS THE KEY IN

05:27:47.681 --> 05:27:49.683
THE CATALYST IN PHOENIX ARIZONA

05:27:49.750 --> 05:27:51.518
SOME FIFTY YEARS AGO.

05:27:51.585 --> 05:27:53.453
THE CATALYST FOR A SUPPLY BANK

05:27:53.520 --> 05:27:55.389
IN CALIFORNIA.

05:27:55.455 --> 05:27:56.623
IS A BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITY

05:27:56.690 --> 05:27:57.891
WHERE YOU CAN CENTRALIZE

05:27:57.958 --> 05:28:00.160
RESOURCES YOU CAN SCALE PROGRAMS

05:28:00.227 --> 05:28:02.396
YOU CAN REDUCE THREE PL SORRY AB

05:28:02.462 --> 05:28:03.730
PRIVATE LOGISTICS AND

05:28:03.797 --> 05:28:05.232
WAREHOUSING COST.

05:28:05.298 --> 05:28:06.666
IS WELL AS OTHER THINGS BUT ALSO

05:28:06.733 --> 05:28:09.436
CENTRALIZED THE PHILANTHROPY IN

05:28:09.503 --> 05:28:09.936
THE GOODNESS THAT'S AND

05:28:10.003 --> 05:28:10.937
EVERYBODY.

05:28:11.004 --> 05:28:12.239
I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT

05:28:12.305 --> 05:28:13.707
THERE PEOPLE WHO MAY ON A

05:28:13.774 --> 05:28:15.509
CONTRACTING BUSINESS AND GET

05:28:15.575 --> 05:28:16.977
SIXTEEN TRUCKS AND DELIVER

05:28:17.044 --> 05:28:18.678
SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND HYGIENE KITS

05:28:18.745 --> 05:28:20.213
STOKELY IN BRENTWOOD IF I ASK

05:28:20.280 --> 05:28:21.214
THEM.

05:28:21.281 --> 05:28:23.050
TO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE

05:28:23.116 --> 05:28:24.885
VOLUNTEERS FROM COMPANIES AND

05:28:24.951 --> 05:28:26.787
ORGANIZATIONS WHO WILL SHOW UP

05:28:26.853 --> 05:28:28.955
EVERY DAY AND VOLUNTEER JUST

05:28:29.022 --> 05:28:30.323
LIKE THEY DO WITH FOOD BACKS.

05:28:30.390 --> 05:28:31.892
AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE SOME OF

05:28:31.958 --> 05:28:33.627
MY BEST MENTORS ARE THE CEO OF

05:28:33.693 --> 05:28:35.095
OUR LOCAL FOOD BANK ALAMEDA

05:28:35.162 --> 05:28:36.530
COUNTY WHICH RANKED NUMBER ONE

05:28:36.596 --> 05:28:37.764
IN THE NATION.

05:28:37.831 --> 05:28:39.499
AND OTHERS FROM SAN DIEGO WERE

05:28:39.566 --> 05:28:40.734
INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE AND DOING

05:28:40.801 --> 05:28:42.335
AMAZING THINGS AND OTHERS THAT

05:28:42.402 --> 05:28:46.907
WE'VE TALKED TO ENGAGE WITH

05:28:46.973 --> 05:28:48.041
ACROSS THE STATE.

05:28:48.108 --> 05:28:49.176
SO I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR

05:28:49.242 --> 05:28:49.709
YOUR CONSIDERATION TO BE A

05:28:49.776 --> 05:28:51.211
PARTNER. FOR WHAT WE THINK

05:28:51.278 --> 05:28:52.579
PHILANTHROPY WILL FILL THE REST

05:28:52.646 --> 05:28:54.781
OF THE GAP OF THE PROPOSALS FOR

05:28:54.848 --> 05:28:56.116
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THREE

05:28:56.183 --> 05:28:57.517
MILLION OF IT MATCHES WHAT IS

05:28:57.584 --> 05:28:59.252
ALREADY BEEN CONTRIBUTED BY TWO

05:28:59.319 --> 05:29:02.155
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE BAY AREA.

05:29:02.222 --> 05:29:03.390
ONE MILLION IS FOR COMMERCIAL

05:29:03.457 --> 05:29:05.926
GRADE AND FIRE RESISTANT STORAGE

05:29:05.992 --> 05:29:08.395
SHEDS FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

05:29:08.462 --> 05:29:09.696
PARTNERS AROUND THE STATE.

05:29:09.763 --> 05:29:10.764
THAT'S BASICALLY SO THAT WE CAN

05:29:10.831 --> 05:29:13.467
PROVIDE THEM WITH MORE MATERIALS

05:29:13.533 --> 05:29:15.168
AND HAVE LESS DELIVERIES.

05:29:15.235 --> 05:29:16.703
BUT IT'S ALSO THERE'S A DISASTER

05:29:16.770 --> 05:29:18.905
RELIEF COMPONENT OF THIS.

05:29:18.972 --> 05:29:19.739
ONE ADVOCATES HERE COULD

05:29:19.806 --> 05:29:21.575
PROBABLY DESCRIBE MUCH BETTER

05:29:21.641 --> 05:29:23.243
THAN I COULD HELP POVERTY IS A

05:29:23.310 --> 05:29:24.678
DISASTER AND IT'S AN ONGOING

05:29:24.744 --> 05:29:26.146
CRISIS BUT WE'RE ALSO ALL

05:29:26.213 --> 05:29:27.080
FAMILIAR.

05:29:27.147 --> 05:29:28.615
WITH THE RECENT DISASTERS IN

05:29:28.682 --> 05:29:30.584
PARADISE IN SANTA ROSA AND

05:29:30.650 --> 05:29:32.119
