WHEN THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL WAS RELEASED AT THE START OF THIS MONTH I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION PRIORITIZED FUNDING FOR LEARNING LOSS. FOR TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD AND HOUSING FOR STUDENTS. I'M ALSO ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO REQUIRING OUR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO CONFIRM THAT ALL HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS COMPLETE THE FAST FOR OR DREAM ACT APPLICATIONS. IN THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR. IN THE CURRENT STATE OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WE NEED TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN'T TO CONNECT OUR PELL GRANT ELIGIBLE STUDENTS TO THE FINANCIAL AID THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.

THESE FUNDS WOULD EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HIGH NEED REGIONS OF THE STATE. ALTHOUGH TODAY'S HEARING IS FOCUSED ON INVESTMENTS IN THE C. U. C. C. IT SEEMS TO ME COLLEGES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES SEVERAL- FINANCIAL AID INVESTMENTS. THE PROVIDE STUDENTS SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING THESE INSTITUTIONS WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU I NOW WE HAVE THE L. A. O. TO JOIN US AS WELL. HI GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS JENNIFER PATEL LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE YOU SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT AND ALLOW HIM TO ENTITLED OVERVIEW OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION BUDGET WE ALSO HAVE THE HANDOUT POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE THE HANDOUT IS INTENDED PRIMARILY AS A REFERENCE DOCUMENT FOR YOU AS YOU WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH THE PROPOSAL'S BOTH THIS BOTH TODAY AND IN THE COMING HEARINGS FOR THE SAKE OF THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE SAKE OF TIME WILL COVER THE MATERIAL QUICKLY PROVIDE SOME BASIC. CONTEXT AND SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS. FOR SOME CONTEXT AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATE BUDGET PACKAGE THE TERROR NOTED THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING NONE OF THE THREE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS RECEIVED BASE INCREASE SAYS. THAT MANY COLLEGES DIDN'T RECEIVE A BASE CUT BUT THEY DID HAVE LARGE PAYMENT DEFERRALS AND THEN THE UNIVERSITY IS AS YOU KNOW RECEIVE THE GENERAL FUND REDUCTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE STATE PAYMENT DEFERRALS IN THE GENERAL FUND REDUCTIONS THE STATEMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED OTHER ADVERE PHYSICAL EFFECTS FROM THE PANDEMIC. SO WE KNOW THAT THE SEGMENTS HAVE HAD DECLINES IN REVENUE FROM THEIR NON CORE PROGRAMS HOUSING DINING PARKING MEDICAL CENTERS AND SCHOOLS. THEY'VE ALSO SEEN A DROP IN THEIR NON RESIDENT INVOLVEMENT. AND THEN I HAD TAKEN ASSOCIATED- DECLINE IN NON RESIDENT TUITION. IN ADDITION TO THE DROPS IN CORE AND NON CORE FUNDING I CAMPUS IS OFFICE ALSO HAVE HAD SOME EXTRAORDINARY COST- FOR EXAMPLE THEY'VE HAD HIGHER THAN NORMAL TECHNOLOGY COSTS. SO YOU KNOW THAT FEDERAL THE FUNDING- CAMPUSES HAVE RECEIVED THEY'VE RECEIVED A FIRST ROUND AND SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THE SECOND ROUND IS X. AND EXPECTED THIS WINTER. THE SECOND ROUND WAS LARGER THAN THE FIRST ROUND SO CALIFORNIA'S ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE AT LEAST TWO POINT NINE BILLION FROM THE SECOND ROUND ONE POINT NINE BILLION FROM THE FIRST ROUND. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING A THIRD ROUNDER THEY'RE IN THE MIDST OF THAT NOW WHAT THEY'RE CONTEMPLATING AS A STARTING POINT EVEN LARGER THAN THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS I'M ALMOST COMBINED SO IF CALIFORNIA WERE TO RECEIVE THE SAME PROPORTION. OF THAT THIRD ROUND THAT THEY'RE CONTEMPLATING RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE- GETTING APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND A HALF BILLION- BUT THAT AGAIN IS JUST A POTENTIAL FUNDING TO CALM. EVEN WITH THE FEDERALLY FUNDED CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR EXAMPLE MOST CAMPUSES ARE HOLDING THEIR VACANT POSITIONS OPEN. EVEN WITH THE COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES WE KNOW THAT THE UNIVERSITIES ARE PROJECTING OPERATING DEFICITS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE ISSUE IS PROJECTING AN OPERATING DEFICIT OF ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION ON THE CORE OPERATING PART OF THEIR BUDGET. AND YOU SEE I'M A DEFICIT OF- AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION. SHIFTING FROM ALL OF THIS BACKDROP AS JUST WHERE THEY ARE NOW- TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED FOR THEM YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ALL JUST JUMP RIGHT INTO SOME ISSUES THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IN THE WEEKS AHEAD. SO AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BASED INCREASE SAYS WE WOULD SUGGEST YOU THINK OF THOSE AS A STARTING POINT. SO AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED LEVELS THE SEGMENTS WOULD HAVE ENOUGH TO COVER HEALTH CARE. AND PENSION COST INCREASES IT HAVE SOME LEFT OVER THAT THEY CAN THINK ABOUT FOR MODEST SALARY INCREASES OR STAFFING RESTORATIONS. I THINK YOU PROBABLY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL MAY BEFORE YOU DECIDE EXACTLY ON THE LEVEL OF BASED INCREASES AT THAT TIME YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF THE STATE'S OUT YOUR OPERATING DEFICITS AT LEAST A SOMEWHAT BETTER IDEA. AND THAT COULD HELP YOU DETERMINE HOW COMFORTABLE YOU ARE WITH EITHER THE 3% AND A HALF PERCENT FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SOMEWHERE HIGHER OF LOWER. REGARDING THE EXPECTATIONS THAT RELATE TO STUDENT EQUITY ONLINE LEARNING IN THE TRANSFER PROCESS WE THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED AREAS OF COMMON INTEREST WITH THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS. BUT IT'S ON THE PROPOSALS WE THINK COULD BE IMPROVED- PRESUMABLY IF INTERESTED YOU AND STAFF COULD BE WORKING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS WORK FOR ALL THE DETAILS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSALS AND WE HAVE SOME IDEAS. FOR YOU TO CONSIDER ON HOW TO IMPROVE THEM. THE GOVERNOR AS YOU KNOW HAS THIS PACKAGE OF STUDENT SUPPORT PROPOSALS STUDENT BASIC NEEDS EMERGENCY GRANTS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ISSUES. IN THESE CASES WE THINK THAT AGAIN THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED BUT NOT ONLY LONG STANDING BUT EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC- BUT IF YOU DO DECIDE TO PUT MORE ONGOING MONEY INTO THESE PROGRAMS WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM'S OBJECTIVES ARE CLEAR. THAT YOU HAVE A WAY TO MEASURE THEM AND THAT YOU'RE AND YOUR AND I MEAN I'M PLACE TOOLS TO ASSESS WHETHER THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ACHIEVING THEIR OBJECTIVES. I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT ALIGNING THE STATE FUNDS WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT YOU KNOW NOW I'M DOWN DO EXIST FOR THE SECOND ROUND OF RELIEF- NEED FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD USE THE STATE FUNDS TO- GIVE GRANTS TO STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE POTENTIALLY INELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS. OR YOU COULD USE THE STATE FUNDS ONCE THE FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE DRIED DRIED UP. LONGER TERM WE THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER HAVING A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR HOW THE STATE IS DEALING WITH STUDENT BASIC NEEDS. APPROACH TO DATE HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT PEACE NOW. THE LAST WEEK AS THE STATE'S ON IF IT IF THE STATE'S FISCAL OUTLOOK WORD TO IMPROVE COME MAY WE THINK YOU COULD CONSIDER PAYING DOWN MORE DEFERRALS THAT WOULD BE ON THE NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BUDGET. YOU COULD ALSO COME IN- CONSIDER PROVIDING MORE FOR UNIVERSITY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT WOULD BE ON THE NINE NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BUDGET. BUT BOTH ACTIONS WOULD HELP IMPROVE BOTH THE STATE AND THE STATEMENTS BUDGET RESILIENCY. SO FOR THE SECOND TIME I REMAIN VERY HIGH LEVEL I HAVE- SKIPPED OVER ISSUES LIKE ENROLLMENT TUITION FINANCIAL AID SUPPLEMENTAL CAME PENSION PAYMENTS. BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK IN MORE DETAIL OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AND THOSE ARE OTHER AREAS. OKAY THANK YOU I'LL HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BUT WHEN WE FIRST OPENED UP TO- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TO ENGAGE WITH. MISTER LAKE MR LEADER MR O'DONNELL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONCERN AND PRIORITY ABOUT STUDENT BASIC NEEDS SO JUST WONDERING CAN THE DEFENSE D. O. F. PLEASE PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND IN REGARDS TO WIDE ADMINISTRATION DECIDED TO PROPOSE A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR STUDENT BASIC NEEDS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS OPPOSED TO ONGOING FUNDS FOR STUDENT BASIC NEEDS LIKE IN THE UC'S ARE CSU. HELLO I GENERALLY WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE M. I. A. WILL. RESPOND WITH- SPECIFICALLY ON THE UC'S NCS USER- AUGMENTATION AND TOUCH ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS MY A COLLEAGUE- DAN HAD OUR WELL WITH THE TO ME COLLEGES COULD. SPECIFY IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- FOR BASIC NEEDS- THE ADMINISTRATION- IS FOCUSED ON PRESERVING AT EQUITY AND I'M PERSON INCREASING EQUITY AND- PROPOSING THE ALL FOR ALL THREE SEGMENTS FOR FIFTEEN MILLION FOR YOU SEE- ONGOING- FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND INTERNET TECHNOLOGY ACCESS. AS WELL AS ON TOP OF THE- FIFTEEN MILLION THAT'S EXISTING FOR THE UC'S FOR TOTAL THIRTY MILLION AND THIRTY MILLION FOR S. YES YOU BREAKING BASIC NEEDS. AND AT THIS TIME- WITHIN THE CURRENT ALLOTMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND THERE'S A THIRTY MILLION ONGOING POP NINETY EIGHT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND JUST PART MENTAL HEALTH AND INTERNET TECHNOLOGY ACCESS AND THE MINISTRATION- CONSIDERS A BOTH- AS NECESSARY. COMPONENTS TOWARD BASIC NEEDS. THANK AND I CAN ACTUALLY. DIED I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO YET JUST CELEBRATE ON MY COLLEGE POINTS THAT THERE IS- THIRTY MILLION ONGOING INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION FOR BASIC NEEDS AFTER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THAT HAVE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE DIGITAL EQUIPMENT DID NOT TO HELP THEM- BUT BY GOLLY TWENTY NOT YET ABOUT BETWEEN A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION IT IS JUST. ABOUT THE OF WHAT HAPPENED ON GOING TO SEARCHES. WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. OKAY THANK YOU I DON'T EVEN KNOW TO HAVE THE METRICS AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING AT THE CAMPUS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO. THEY BRING IT UP THANK YOU FOR IT ANSWER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER A DONALD. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I QUESTION WAS JUST ABOUT THE A PROPOSAL WITH REGARD TO THE FAST FUN- YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WE WANT EVERY STUDENT TO FILL THAT OUT BUT ACTUALLY WE DON'T BECAUSE WE ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND- I'M ONE WHO IS IMPLEMENTED. YOU KNOW THE- YOU HAD STUDENTS FALL THE PASSWORD IN THIS CLASS ARE MANY TIMES. AND IT IS OFTEN THAT DAIS SOME STUDENTS FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE UNDOCUMENTED. SO WHAT BORDERS ARE THERE AROUND THIS POLICY THAT SOON SO THAT STUDENTS DON'T WALK INTO A LEGAL TRAP. BECAUSE IF THEY DO SUBMIT THAT FAST FOR- THAT COULD LEAD TO AUTOMATE COULD LEAD TO SOME CRIMINAL PROCEEDING SO COULD YOU. DETAIL. PROBABLY DEPARTMENT FINANCE. HI BRIANNA FRIENDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES OF THE FACTS THE PROPOSAL- LANGUAGE ACTUALLY BILL LANGUAGE ON THAT PROPOSAL SHOULD BE COMING OUT LATER TODAY- BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL IS TO AND HIGHER SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THAT A STUDENT HAS EITHER FILLED OUT THERE FAST ENOUGH OR THEY'RE KEY TO APPLICATION SO IT SO IT TO INCLUDE- UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED. YOU JUST ENCOURAGING STUDENTS TO DO THAT IS THAT ACCURATE. THAT'S CORRECT THE SCHOOL WILL BE REQUIRED TO ENJOY THE STATE HAS NOT EITHER QUORUM OR THAT STUDENT HAS OPTED OUT SO THERE IS AN OPT OUT PROVISION BE INTO LANGUAGE OKAY THE OPT OUT THE OPT OUT PROVISION IS. VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM OF REASONS NOT JUST FOR THIS TO ORINDA- THE FAN MAY NOT WANT. THEIR STUDENTS THERE TRY. TO SIGN UP FOR THE FIRST BUT I THE BEGINNING REALLY SENSE TO THE THAT STUDENTS ARE GOING TO OTHER UNDOCUMENTED. AND THIS STATE COULD BE SETTING UP A LEGAL TRAP WE NEED TO BE VERY COGNISANT OF AND AS ONE WHO'S YOU KNOW DONE THIS ON THE GROUND AS MUCH AS TELL TELL YOU THIS IS A- THIS DYNAMIC ISRAEL SO WATCH WHAT YOU'RE WALKING INTO HERE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR POLICY IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH. AND STRONG ENOUGH SO THAT THIS THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN ACROSS OUR STATE WERE STUDENTS ACTUALLY. CREADA A SITUATION THAT IS ADVERSE TO THEIR FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MAKING. MR GALLAGHER A SENIOR NO. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER REST. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE IS A PROPOSAL FOR A MUCH LARGER COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE. ESPECIALLY AS COMPARED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN YOU SHARE WITH US WHY THIS IS. SURE DENTON AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I THINK. I'M NOT REALLY ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE SPECIFICS OF THE COLOR THAT WAS PROVIDED TO K. TWELVE BUT SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE- THE CODE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- THAT I WOULD BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES ABOUT. OF ONGOING FUNDING- BUT BASICALLY WE REALLY WITH THIS PROJECT WANTED TO FOCUS ON. YOU KNOW PROVIDING FOR OUR STUDENTS- EARLY ESTIMATES OF ENROLLMENT SHOWS THAT IT'S BEEN DOWN EIGHT PERCENT- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND SO ONE OF THE REALBIG FOCUSES WITH THIS BUDGET. WHAT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS RECORDS MERGING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANT- BASIC NEED FUNDING- THAT WOULD HELP EARLY ENROLLMENT- AND YOU KNOW AS AS WE ARE AWARE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION THERE WERE SOME STUDENTS WHO UP TO WHO NEVER CAME BACK IN SO- ARE PART OF THE TIME AROUND IT IS TO. MAKE SURE THAT THAT SAME THING DOESN'T HAPPEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ONE. YES SOMEONE ELSE- THE IMPORTANT BECAUSE MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH. AND HE HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THOSE TEACHERS WHO DOES HELP THEIR STUDENTS. HE HAS. I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S POSITION ON THIS KNOWING THAT. THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO FILL UP FAST WHEN DREAM ACT APPLICATIONS- WHO WOULD LATER GO TO COLLEGES SO MUCH GREATER THAN THOSE WHO DO NOT FILL OUT THE FORM SO TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE OF THE WE NEVER DO SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO- IT DIDN'T CAUSE ANY KIND OF LEGAL PROBLEMS FOR STUDENTS IS VERY IMPORTANT- BALANCING THAT WITH THE- THE STATISTICS THAT SHOW THE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT FILLING OUT THE FAST FOR FORM. FILLING UP THE DREAM ACT FORM- IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR MOST OF OUR STUDENTS TO GO TO COLLEGE SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE BALANCED AND I APPRECIATE THAT MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS ON THAT. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY A DENTIST. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR RECOGNIZING ME I'M- SO IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THERE IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS- I DO WANT TO KNOW ONE MORE DETAILS WILL BE AVAILABLE BUT- PARTICULARLY CANNOT FUNDING BE USED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR. INSTRUCTIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS AS IT PERTAINS TO PUBLIC SAFETY TRAINING- IN MY DISTRICT THAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE CALL TO THE CANYONS THAT I WENT TO THEY OFFER SOME GREAT PUBLIC AFETY TRAINING PROGRAMS AND AS WE LOOK AT- THE BREAK DOWN OF WHAT STUDENTS ACTUALLY GO AND PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. IT'S A LOT OF LATINO STUDENTS AND THIS BECAUSE PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR- ARE GOOD PAYING JOB CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS- IT TO BE A PARAMEDIC A AND M. T. A FIREFIGHTER OR POLICE OFFICER AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE'VE NOTICED OVER THIS PAST YEAR- OUR HUSBAND COME BECOME HEIGHTENED IS OUR LACK OF PUBLIC SAFETY PROFESSIONALS THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED. RIGHT NOW I'M CAN ANY OF THIS FUNDING BE USED TO AUGMENT THE REALITY THAT COLLEGE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONLY REALLY RECEIVING ABOUT 70% FOR THAT FOR THOSE PROGRAMS AND ONE WILL ADDITIONAL DETAILS BE AVAILABLE- ABOUT THE. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND DINNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC I DON'T SPECIFIC AT THE TIME ABOUT WHEN THOSE PHOTOS ARE. WILL BE UNVEILED THE- AND THAT YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THAT MONEY SET ASIDE BUT- DOESN'T FOCUS WILL BE. RELEASED IN ORDER MORE DETAILS WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER ON IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. I'M GONNA THINK SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO THE CONCERNS THAT YOU NOTED AND BROUGHT UP- I THINK I'M I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE CONCERNS BACK AND AS WE- DON'T. KNOW FOR THE BUDGET PROCESS. GREAT THANK YOU. MR GALLAGHER. YEAH ONE QUESTION I HAD FOR- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WHEN WILL ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE PLACE HOLDER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT- BE AVAILABLE. SHE SAYS THAT. I AGAIN I THINK- THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE DETAILS ON THAT LATER ON IN THE BUDGET PROCESS- HOWEVER I DON'T HAVE DETAILS AND THE TIMELINE AT THIS AT THIS POINT. OKAY AND THEN- ON THE DUAL ADMISSIONS PATHWAY- CAN YOU SAY AT THIS POINT WHO WOULD ALL UC CAMPUSES BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE- WITH APPLICANTS BE REQUIRED TO DECLARE A MAJOR. AT THE TIME OF THE APPLICATION- ARE THE STUDENTS GUARANTEED THE CAMPUS OF THEIR CHOICE AT THE TIME THAT MISSION OR THEY SUBJECT TO RE DIRECTION I MEAN ANYTHING LIKE ON THESE POINTS THAT YOU CAN. PROVIDED THIS POINT. PINE RIDGE ALLEGED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I CAN SPEAK TO THE DOLE ADMISSIONS PROPOSAL AND SAY. IN TERMS OF A SPECIFIC CAMPUS WE DO. IMAGINE THAT YOU APPLY GOING IN KNOWING THAT A SPECIFIC CCC AND A SPECIFIC UC OR CSU IS GOING TO BE YOUR PATHWAY. SO ESSENTIALLY THAT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE TAG NOW FOR UC CAMPUSES WHERE YOU MAKE A GREEN MET WITH FOR EXAMPLE UC SANTA CRUZ AND YOU. KNOW THROUGH YOUR CCC EXPERIENCE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEND THOSE THROUGH THIS AGREEMENT THAT'S THE MODEL OF THE DAHLE MISSIONS THAT WERE IMAGINING. WE ALSO IMAGINE THAT EACH UC CAMPUS UMASS. THE PARTICIPATION AND WE DO IMAGINE ALL. YOU SEE CAMPUSES PARTICIPATING- THEY SHOULD ALL BE PARTICIPATING IN THAT IS REALLY THE STUDENT WHO MAKES THAT SORT OF CHOICE. THAT'S RIGHT YOU WOULDN'T DO SO WE IMAGINE YOU APPLY. NOT GENERICALLY TO YOU SEE BUT YOU YOU APPLY TO THE DAHLE MISSIONS PROGRAM BY CLICKING THROUGH THE EMISSIONS AND SPECIFYING IN THAT PROCESS THIS IS THE CCC I IMAGINE AND THIS IS THE UC I IMAGINE. MR SHERIFF I MAY I HAVE JUST ONE POINT TO ADD TO THAT AS WELL WE WILL HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON MISSIONS PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE POSTED TODAY. THAT SHOULD ANSWER A NUMBER OF THOSE QUESTIONS IN MORE DETAIL AS WELL. THANK YOU. MR GALLAGHER THAT'S ALL OKAY. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. BEFORE WE GET TO OUR OUR OTHER PRESENTERS WE HAVE AGAIN TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THEY GET ONLINE- I WANTED TO FIRST TALK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL AID ISSUE I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF FINDING WAYS TO INCREASE STUDENTS TO FILL OUT. THE FAFSA FORM OR I DON'T FORGET THE NAME OF IT THEIR PURPOSE FORM TO FILL OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT- STUDENTS- AS REYES RESEARCH SHOWS THIS IS A GAME CHANGER FOR TWO REASONS ONE IF STUENTS DON'T FILL IT OUT AND THEY GO ON TO COLLEGE AND THEN THEY TRY TO PLAY FOR THE CAL GRANT. THEY GO IN THE COMPETITIVE POT WHERE THE ODDS OF GETTING A CAL GRANT ARE ONE AND TWELVE ON IT GET YOUR WANTED SEVENTEEN FOR SOME OF THE BAD YEARS SO ESSENTIALLY IT'S A LOTTERY TYPE THING WHERE IS IF YOU FILL OUT THAT PASSED THE FORM WHEN YOU'RE A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT SO IT'S AGAIN IT'S FINANCIAL AID AND SO- SO MANY STUDENTS DOWN THE ROAD. THAT YOU ASK THEM WHY DIDN'T YOU. APPLY EARLIER I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT MY COUNSELOR WAS BUSY DEALING WITH. LIFE AND OUR PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS WE KNOW THE COUNSELOR STUDENT RATIOS HORRENDOUS CENTER SCHOOL SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG ISSUE. PLUS THE FACT THAT RESEARCH SHOWS IF YOU ASK- LATINO STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY AN IMMIGRANT STUDENTS. WHY DIDN'T YOU APPLY MANY TIMES THEY THINK THAT THEY COULDN'T APPLY BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS WEREN'T. DOCUMENT AND EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ELIGIBLE. AS A CALIFORNIANS BORN HERE. OR THEY CAN APPLY FOR THIS NEW PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE CREATING CALIFORNIA FOR OUR DREAMER STUDENTS SO. I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT AND I'M IN FULL SUPPORT I THINK WE SHOULD PUT THE ONUS MORE ON. THE SCHOOL AND THE DISTRICTS TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE WITH THEIR STUDENT POPULATION SO. FULL SUPPORT OF THAT- I WANT TO IT NOTE THAT THE CALL ISSUE- THIS COMMITTEE. STRONG SUPPORTERS ARE A COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL BE MAKING. SURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS. PROPRIA LONG TERM FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES I WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THEY COULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE. WITH ENROLLMENT TARGETS FOR. UC AND CSU AS MANY OF THE MEMBERS- ALREADY KNOW OURS ARE FRESH MEMBERS WILL FIND OUT. WHEN YOU GOT BACK HOME. YOUR KIDS TEACHERS ARE GONNA COME UP TO YOU AT THE PARK THE PARADE WHAT HAVE YOU AND SAY. MY LOOK MY NEIGHBOR MY CELL AND CELL PLIED TO. UC OR CSU AND DIDN'T GET IN AND WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE- WE HAVE SPOTS FOR ALL OF OUR QUALITY QUALIFIED GRADUATES AND SO. I THINK HAVING APPROPRIATE TARGETS ARE ARE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE NOT. ALWAYS COUNT ON THE SYSTEM. TO DO RIGHT BY THAT I KNOW THEY TRY THEIR BEST BUT IT THIS IS A PRIORITY OF OURS SO. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT CAN YOU PINE ON THAT THESE DEBTS ENROLLMENT TARGETS FOR THAT FOR THE- TWO SEGMENTS UC AND CSU. CERTAINLY BROWN RELEASED FROM DEPARTMENT OF. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. TO TWO POINTS ABOUT ENROLLMENT AT CSU AND UC THE FIRST IS OUR BIG FOCUS WITH THIS BUDGET WAS ON THE CCC'S. BECAUSE ENROLLMENT DROPPED EIGHT PERCENT. WE ESTIMATE FROM THIS FALL COMPARED TO LAST FALL. THE SECOND POINT IS THAT CSU AND UC- WHEREAS NATIONALLY THERE HAS BEEN SOME STRUGGLES WITH ENROLLMENT. WE'RE FORTUNATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT CSU AND UC ARE NOT PROJECTING ENROLLMENT DROPS AND IN FACT UC. WAS ABLE TO MEET A TWENTY NINETEEN TARGET. INCREASE OF FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY STUDENTS BUT THE LEGISLATURE ADDED AND FUNDED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND THAT THAT AMOUNT OF FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED SPREAD OVER INTO THE COVE IT ACADEMIC YEAR. SO THERE WAS INITIALLY THAT. ONE COULD HAVE BEEN CONCERNED THAT MAYBE THEY WOULDN'T MEET THAT WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTY. ARE SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. IT'S A BIG DEAL THE UC WAS ABLE TO MEET THAT FORTY EIGHT SIXTY ADDITIONAL STUDENTS AND GROW DURING CALL THAT- SO THAT'S OUR PERSPECTIVE. OKAY AND WHAT WHAT IS THE L. A. L. THINK ABOUT. THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE. TYING DOWN A ROMAN TARGETS. I'M JENNIFER PATEL AGAIN L. A. L. AT YEAH AS WE RECOMMENDED HISTORICALLY WE THINK- STUDYING AND ROMAN TARGETS AS AN IMPORTANT STATE RESPONSIBILITY LEGISLATURE TYPICALLY DOES SET THEM- SO WE- RECOGNIZE IT'S A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING THIS YEAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF THE FORCES OUT WORK AND IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR WELL THEY'LL ALL LAND SO WE KNOW HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE PROJECTED TO GO OVER VERY SLOWLY. WE KNOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES ENROLLMENT IS DOWN PRETTY STEEPLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- ROUGHLY 10% WE KNOW UC AND CSU DID GROW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ONE PERCENT- AND EACH OF THEM DURING TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE ECONOMY WILL REACT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE BASKET VACCINE DISTRIBUTION ALTHOUGH WHEN BOTH K. TWELVE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS WILL BE BACK TO. A DIFFERENT- BACK TO THINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE NORMAL FOR THEM SO IT'S HARD FOR US TO TELL YOU WHETHER YOU SHOULD BUDGET FLAT FOR THE COMING YEAR OR OR UP OR DOWN- WE DO CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU SET THE TARGETS THAT ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THEIR ADMISSIONS PROCESS SO IT'S ALMOST TOO LATE RIGHT NOW TO INFLUENCE THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE MAKING THEIR DECISIONS RIGHT NOW AND THEY WILL HAVE MADE THEM BEFORE JUNE. SO WE CAN SEND YOU THAT ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT SETTING TARGETS FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IT'S JUST IT'S HARD- YOU WILL HAVE TO SORT OF MAKE JUST A JUDGMENT CALL DO YOU WANT THEM TO GROW OR STAY FLAT GROW BY 2% BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A LOT OF CLARITY FROM THE FORCES AT WORK. IF I COULD JUST ONE MINUTE ON THIS ISSUE OF THE COLA BECAUSE IT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING ISSUE WHETHER IT SCHOOL DISTRICTS COLLEGES UCCS YOU THE BULK OF THE BUDGETS ARE COMPENSATION AND THEY'RE ALL FACING INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE ALL FACING INCREASES IN PENSION COSTS ARE ALL FACING SALARY PRESSURES AND THEY'RE ALL STILL FACING STAFFING PRESSURES JUST A LEVEL OF STAFF THAT THEY HAVE. SO IT IS INTERESTING WHY IN. SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAKE IT THREE POINT POINT. PER AND UNIVERSE WOULD BE LEFT ON LEVEL THAT'S EVEN BY TO THEIR NINETEEN TWENTY LEVEL SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT DO YOU WHAT YOU WANT. THE STATEMENTS- WHETHER AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE YOU SEE WHERE YOU WANT THEM TO LAND WHEN YOU DO YOUR FINAL BUDGET CALLS OUT. THANK YOU I COMPLETELY AGREE 1100% THAT- THE COST FOR. HER FOR STAFFING- FACULTY AND CREDENTIALED. FACULTY IS THE SAME MEDICAID TWELVE SCHOOL COMMUNICABLE TO YOU SEE THE CSU SO WE SHOULD DO THAT AND I DIDN'T GET TO YET BUT I DO- SUPPORT. WHAT WE CAN DO TO RESTORE THOSE ONGOING UC AND CSU. FUNDING I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF ONE TIME MONEY COMING IN. WE COULD GET MUCH MORE IF WE HAVE THE THIRD. TESTING THIS BILL THAT'S BEING DEBATED RIGHT NOW IN CONGRESS. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THAT'S THAT'S ON. OUR LIST- OUT YOU ONE THING THAT I THINK THAT WE HEARD FROM- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE EARLIER. AND SOMEONE MEMBER RAMOS AT THE GET GO WAS JUST. THE PAIN THIS IS CAUSED ON OUR LOWER INCOME STUDENTS- DONNELLY AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THAT ARE CSU BUT ALSO WHAT ARE YOU SEE. AND IN THAT THE NUMBER OF STEPS THAT THE ENROLLMENT I THINK THAT THE HEADLINES WITH WE SEE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING TO UC. ARE THROUGH THE ROOF- THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THOSE. STUDENTS ARE APPLY OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE STUDENTS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND EVEN AT THAT THAT CSU SO. THE SUPPORT FOR THINGS LIKE BASIC NEEDS AN- EMERGENCY HOUSING AND ALL THAT I THINK IS SO CRITICAL I KNOW THERE'S- SOME ONE TIME MONEY IN THERE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE MAY TRY TO PUT MORE. FOR ON GOING OR AT THE MINIMUM- PUT MORE ONE TIME AND HOW THE SPENT OVER THREE YEARS SO YOU CAN AT LEAST HAVE CERTAINTY THAT. YOU CAN HAVE SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE- THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. IS CERTAINLY SOME THAT FOR CENTER YOU'RE THIS TO TESTED- WE'LL WE'LL HEAR THAT- YOU KNOW. THEN THAT MOUNTED THE PRESSURE ON STUDENTS IS ALWAYS GREAT BUT ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW DURING. DURING DURING THE NINETEEN- THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I THINK ONGOING SUPPORT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS THAT IT'S A PRIORITY HERE AS WELL- SO. WITH THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WE DON'T HAVE OUR- OUR PANEL IS COMING INTO FORCE. SO ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS RECRUITING MEMBERS SAYING NONE. MISTER MEDINA NO SO DO WE HAVE ANYBODY WITH KNOWLEDGE OR THE AUDIENCE OF COURSE- DO WE HAVE ANYBODY. BY ANY CHANCE QUEUED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMEN.

YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS START WITH THE UC BUT LET'S MIX IT UP AND OF COURSE THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE ARE. THE WORK COURSE OF OUR STATE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WITH TWO MILLION. STUDENTS AND- SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES DURING THIS PANDEMIC SO- CHANCELLOR TEASE OAKLEY YOU CAN YOU CAN BEGIN. F. ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S A- PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU EVEN THOUGH WE ARE REMOTE I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE THERE WITH YOU BUT- THESE ARE. INTERESTING TIMES NO DOUBT SO- LET ME BEGIN AGAIN BY JUST THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR ON GOING SUPPORT. A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND MORE BROADLY HIGHER EDUCATION- THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY NOW AS WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT THE RECOVERY FROM THIS PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW A YEAR AGO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERED. BURKE NEARLY ALL OF THE INSTRUCTION WITHIN THE LARGEST SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY TO REMOTE DELIVERY. I WASN'T EVEN- I THOUGHT. WE DIDN'T PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ON HOW TO PROVIDE LAPTOPS AT SCALE TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WHO CAN AFFORD THEM OR HOW TO KEEP FOOD PANTRIES OPEN- DURING THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC AND HELP FEED- STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCONCEIVABLE TO DISCUSS HOW COLLEGES. SHOULD pFROM THE RESPIRATORY THERAPY PROGRAMS. THE STATE'S EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. YET. WE DID THIS AND SO MUCH MORE OVER THE PAST YEAR IN OUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN COLLEGES ALL STEP FORWARD STEPPED UP. AND DID WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITIES. AS PANDEMIC IN FEAR SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS. DO WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO- BEATTY PUT THE COMMUNITY ABOVE THEMSELVES THEY STEPPED OUT THEY RAISE MONEY THEY- PASSED OUT FOOD. AND THEY DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT INSTRUCTION WAS NOT INTERRUPTED. IN ADDITION TO THE RESPONSE TO A ONCE IN A LIFETIME PANDEMIC- THERE WAS ALSO A LONG OVERDUE- RECKONING WITH RACISM THAT SHOOK OUR COUNTRY TO THE CORE AND IT CONTINUES TO RIPPLE THROUGHOUT SOCIETY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FOR US TO USE THIS PANDEMIC AS AN EXCUSE TO PULL BACK ON OUR COMMITMENT TO ENDING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN OUR COLLEGES. BUT THAT MISUNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF THIS CRISIS THE EVENTS OF THE PAST YEAR HAVE MADE VISIBLE DISPARITIES THAT ARE BLACK AND AFRICAN AMERICAN LATIN NEXT ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY SEVEN COUNTER FOR GENERATIONS. ARE AND YOU KNOW THESE EVENTS. ONLY DEEPENED AWARENESS AND CRYSTALLIZE OUR COMMITMENT TO STUDENTS IN THE INVESTMENTS. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IN ORDER TO RIGHT THESE WRONGS MY REMARKS WILL FOCUS ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUDGET PRIORITIES HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS ARE COLLEGES HAVE MADE. OUR AND OUR HISTORIC SYSTEM REFORMS. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS OUR COLLEGES HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS EARN CREDENTIALS BY VISION FOR SUCCESS SUCCESS GOALS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON THE GOALS ON TRANSFER. OUR AND- NARROWING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AMONGST OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WERE GETTING JOBS IN THEIR FIELD OF STUDY THIS IS ALL THANKS TO OUR TREMENDOUS FACULTY AND STAFF. AND THANKS TO THE ASSEMBLY SUPPORT OUR LEADERSHIP PARTICULARLY IN THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI IRWIN. WE HAVE BANDED A PLACEMENT SYSTEM THAT FAILED STUDENTS BY IN ACCURATELY MEASURING THEIR POTENTIAL. AND THEN REPLACING IT WITH ONE THAT IS LEADING TO MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO AND SUCCESS IN TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH AND MATH COURSES EACH OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD THAT WE SHOULD BE DEEPLY PROUD OF. BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH NOT IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME. THIS MOMENT CALLS ON US AS LEADERS TO DO SOMETHING MORE THAT MAKES A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE THIS GENERATION OF STUDENTS. THIS MOMENT CALLS ON US TO TAKE ACTION COMMENSURATE. WITH THE MOMENT THAT WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AND WE MUST LEVERAGE THE RESOURCES PRESENTED IN THIS BUDGET TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH THE URGENCY THEY EXPECT FROM US. YOUR AGENCY THAT THEY NEED FROM US. AS YOU WELL KNOW OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING HUGE CHALLENGES AT THIS TIME YOU HEARD FROM ANY OF THEM ALREADY. ONE IN FIVE STUDENTS SAID THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FURLOUGHED OR LAID OFF DURING THIS PANDEMIC. HALF REPORT THEIR INCOMES ARE LOWER. 57% OF STUDENTS ARE DEALING WITH BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES INCLUDING FOOD AND HOUSING INSECURITY. MANY OF OUR HOMES. MORE THAN FOUR IN TEN STUDENTS SAY THAT THEY NEED TO CARE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. WHILE ALSO GOING TO SCHOOL AND CAN AND COMPLETING THEIR STUDIES. OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR THESE NUMBERS ARE EVEN HIGHER REFLECTING A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT THAT COVERT NINETEEN THIS HAD ON THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THE LEGACY OF EXCLUSION FROM OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD WEALTH. OR ACCESS EDUCATION AND ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE. THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET SHOULD. PUT STUDENTS FIRST. WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN THE MOST AFFECTED ELECTION. AGENT IN FOR A BUDGET PROPOSAL. THAT LAYS A STRONG FOUNDATION. ALL HIGHLIGHTED SEVERAL INVESTMENTS THAT TRULY PUTS STUDENTS FIRST INCLUDING A PROPOSED EMERGENCY STUDENT AID. THE ONLINE EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCES. OR FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. EVEN BEFORE COVER NINETEEN TOO MANY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE STRUGGLING WITH BASIC NEEDS INSECURITIES COVERT NINETEEN HAS FURTHER EXPOSED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISPARITIES WE MUST PRIORITIZE THE PROPOSED STUDENT EMERGENCY AID BOTH IN THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE AND IN THE BUDGET ACT LET'S NOT LOSE ANOTHER J. GENERATION OF STUDENTS LET'S GIVE OUR STUDENTS THE SAME URGENCY THAT THEY'RE LIVING THEIR LIVES WITH RIGHT NOW. AND PROVIDE THEM EMERGENCY AID THAT THEY NEED. AS WE ENTER THE ELEVENTH MONTH OF THE PANDEMIC THE IDEA OF ETURNING TO NORMAL TEAMS DISTANCE MATTER FACT THERE IS NO RETURNING TO WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS NORMAL. WE'RE ENTERIG INTO A COMPLETELY NEW CHAPTER OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER EDUCATION AND MEASURE LEARNING. THE FACT IS THAT OUR COLLEGES WILL FACE A NEW NORMAL WHERE THEY LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY INCREASE ACCESS AND INNOVATE IN AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM OUR SYSTEM NEEDS STRONG INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY RESOURCE. BY WAY OF THE TEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO MEET THIS OPPORTUNITY AND CONTINUE. TO OFFER DISTANCE EDUCATION TO OVER TWO MILLION STUDENTS. WE MUST CONTINUE TO NARROW THEIR FOCUS AND HELP NOT JUST OUR STUDENTS IN OUR CLASSROOMS. BUT THE ADULT WORKERS THE LEARNERS THAT ARE IN THE ECONOMY THAT NEED TO BE RESCHEDULED AND UPSCALE. OUR TO GET BACK INTO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. OUR SYSTEM BUDGET REQUEST EMPHASIZED THAT IMPROVING FACULTY IN DIVERSITY IS VITAL TO ENSURING STUDENTS CAN IDENTIFY WITH FACULTY AND STAFF TO HELP THEM SUCCEED. WE BASS FOR SEVEN SEAT SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION IN THE BUDGET TO HELP WITH FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY. AND WITH EQUITY AND INCLUSION WORK INCLUDING ADVANCING ANTI RACISM IN THE CURRICULUM THE PROPOSED TWENTY MILLION. ONE TIME INVESTMENT AND CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROVIDES A CHANCE. HILDA CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT IS MORE JUST MORE EQUITABLE. WE STAND FULLY BEHIND THIS WORK AND LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO BUILD ON THIS PROPOSAL AND TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN. GREAT FACULTY OF COLOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO HAVE AN ACTIONABLE PLAN TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS THIS IS NOTHING NEW FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE HAVE THAT PLAN THAT PLAN IS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO ALIGN THE TENET OF THE PROPOSAL WILL DISTRICTS LOCAL VISION GOALS AND STUDENT EQUITY BY. FIVE FINALLY AS WE PREPARE FOR REVISED BUDGET ESTIMATES OF ANY- AND SHOULD THERE BE MORE RESEARCH. YES YOUR TIES FURTHER PAIN DWN DEFERRALS WE MUST BRING DOWN THE DEFERRALS. A CLOSE BY EMPHASIZING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE HERE TO WORK TOGETHER. WITH YOU FOR EQUITABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY NOT A RECOVERY THAT FAVORS WALL STREET BUT ONE THAT FAVORS MAINSTREET MAIN STREET IN CALIFORNIA EVERY STUDENT TWENTY FOR SHOT. SO LET'S. LET'S USE THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS THE HELP THAT THEY NEED AND GET IT TO THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU FOR THE TIME CANACCORD ANSWERING ANY OF YOUR. THANK YOU WHAT WE'LL DO QUESTIONS AT THE END AFTER WE HAVE OUR THREE. INDIVIDUALS THAT PARTICIPATE AT NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM OUR CHANCELLOR FOR THE CSU SYSTEM. CHANCER CASTRO THIS IS HIS- FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN US SO- WELCOME. CANCER CASTRO. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CARTY THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH YOU AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. ALONG WITH MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES AND AT SUCH A CONSEQUENTIAL HISTORIC MOMENT IN TIME FOR OUR STATE AND NATION. OUR NATION IS DEEPLY EMBEDDED REALLY DIVIDED. OUR MOST SACRED DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN THREATENS. FIRST THROUGH RECKLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE RHETORIC AND THEN UNIMAGINABLY THROUGH VIOLENT ACTS OF INSURRECTION. AND STILL A PANDEMIC RAGES WRECKING AND CALCULABLE SUFFERING AND CAUSING GREAT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WHILE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING PEOPLE OF MODEST MEANS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHO CONTINUE TO INDOOR HEARTBREAKING ACTS OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. BUT STILL I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY WITH GREAT OPTIMISM DESPITE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE I WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AT AN INFLECTION POINT. AND AS THE NATION'S LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY AND ONE OF ITS LEADING DRIVERS OF SOCIO ECONOMIC ASCENT. IT IS OUR GREAT PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP OUR STATE AND NATION TURN TOWARD HEALING RECONCILIATION. AND RECOVERY. AND ENHANCING ITS BUDGET PROPOSAL EARLIER THIS MONTH THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION EMPHASIZED THE CRITICAL ROLE HIGHER EDUCATION WILL PLAY IN CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY AND SUSTAINED ECONOMIC VITALITY. AND GOVERNOR NUISANCE PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A WELCOME AND NECESSARY REINVESTMENT IN THE CSU. AND FOR THAT I EXPRESS MY DEEP APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE. I ASSURE YOU WE WILL DELIVER ON THIS IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUING TO PRODUCE CAREER READY GRADUATES AND THE STATE'S NEXT GENERATION A BOLD TALENTED AND DIVERSE LEADERS. HOWEVER WE STAND READY TO DO MORE. AND THAT'S HISTORIC MOMENT IN TIME DEMANDS THAT WE DO MORE. BUT WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT. WE ASKED FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING DOLLARS AND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION AND ONE TIME DOLLARS TO FULLY RESTORE PRIOR CUTS TO THE CSU BUDGET. TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC VITALITY INTO THE FUTURE. AND WITHOUT FUNDING WE'LL BE ABLE TO FULLY FUND. ACTUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS MANY OF YOU YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INVESTMENT WITH A PROVEN RETURN. THE SEATTLE TO USE GRADUATION RATES ARE CURRENTLY AT ALL TIME HIGHS FOR STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS BUT WE MUST DO MORE TO ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS. A GOAL THAT IS ALIGNED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S EQUITY MINDED BUDGET PROPOSAL. THERE ARE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE PANDEMIC AN ASSOCIATED ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL OUR MORAL IMPERATIVE TO CORRECT THIS INEQUITY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE APPARENT FOR MORE URGENT. WITH THE ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDS WE CAN BEGIN TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CSU IS CRITICAL FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. MAKING OUR AGING CAMPUS BUILDINGS SAFER AND MORE SEISMICALLY SOUND. WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN APPROVED PROJECTS THEY CAN IMMEDIATELY PROCEED TO DESIGN OR CONSTRUCTION. TO HELP STIMULATE THE ECONOMY AND PROVIDE DESPERATELY NEEDED JOBS. AND WALDRON THE TOPIC OF JOBS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET AND THANKS TO OUR PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. AND THE STRATEGIC USE OF OUR RESERVE FUNDS THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES NOT ONLY WILL WE NOT BE RAISING TUITION FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND A SYSTEM WIDE FURLOUGH PROGRAM THIS YEAR. AND I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT TOGETHER WE WILL NOT HAVE TO LAY OFF ANY ADDITIONAL PERMANENT CSU FACULTY OR STAFF. DUE TO THE LACK OF STATE FUNDS. BUT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN RETAIN THESE JOBS FOR THE LONG TERM. THE PERMANENT RESTORATION OF OUR BUDGET IS ESSENTIAL. THE FIFTY THREE THOUSAND CSU FACULTY AND STAFF HELLO BLOOD OF THE CSU TO DEVOTE THEIR LIVES WORK TO OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS AND WELL BEING. DESERVE NOTHING LESS. FOR RESTORATION OF CUTS WILL ENSURE LONG TERM ECONOMIC STABILITY FOR OUR CAMPUSES AND PROTECT OUR VALUED EMPLOYEES. LIKE YOU I BELIEVE THAT TALENT EXISTS IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD FROM THE PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED APARTMENT COMPLEX THAT I GREW UP IN HANFORD THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE GOLDEN STATE. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNLEASH THAT TALENT AND PREPARE A NEW GENERATION OF BALD LEADERS WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE GOLDEN STATE TO NEW HEIGHTS OF SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE. I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SEE THE CSU IS A RESOURCE IN THE COMING DAYS WEEKS AND YEARS AS WE TACKLE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES TOGETHER.

ARE EXCEPTIONAL LEADERSHIP ARE COVERED REACHES FAR BEYOND THE I SEE YOU OF COURSE THOUGH AND- TODAY I UC SAN FRANCISCO IS OPERATING A VACCINATION SITES FOR ELDERLY SAN FRANCISCANS. AND FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH UCSF. YOUR PARTNER WITH THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND CITY COLLEGE OF SAN FRANCISCO TO OFFER. A THOUSAND VACCINATION TODAY AT A DRIVE THRU CLINIC FACILITY. NOW THERE IN SAN FRANCISCO. UC DAVIS WAS RECENTLY FEATURED IN A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE FOR THEIR WORK IN FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC FOR THE ENTIRE CITY OF DAVIS THIS WAS JUST OVER THIS PAST. WEEKEND I COMMEND THIS ARTICLE TO YOU. THE CAMPUS IS PROVIDING ALL DAVIS RESIDENTS FREE COVER TESTING. THEY'VE TRAINED GRADUATE STUDENTS TO DO CONTACT TRACING THEY'VE RECRUITED HOTEL AND APARTMENT OWNERS TO PROVIDE THREE ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE HOUSING. TO ANYONE IN TOWN WHO IS EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS. R. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE UNDERGRADUATE AMBASSADORS. TO COMBAT HEALTH IN THIS INFORMATION AND TO HAND OUT FREE MASKS. UC IRVINE IS TURN THEIR ATHLETICS ARENA INTO A VACCINATION CENTERS SERVING UP- ULTIMATELY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS. AND THE CABINET THAT IT'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO VACCINATE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE COUNTIES DECIDED DISNEYLAND ONCE GREATER VACCINE SUPPLY BECOMES AVAILABLE WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. YOU SEE IS WORLD CLASS RESEARCHERS ALSO SAYS THAT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CARBON. IN JUST BROUGHT ONE ADDITIONAL EXAMPLE UC IRVINE MEDICAL CENTER BLOTCH CALIFORNIA'S FIRST SITE. FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE ANTIVIRAL DRUG ROOM DISAPPEAR. WHICH ISN'T TO BECOME A STANDARD THERAPY FOR MANY SEVERELY ILL PLACE PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED FOR CORPORATE NINETEEN. ALL UC CAMPUSES HAVE QUICKLY PIVOTED TO REMOTE LEARNING THEY DID THIS LAST LAST LAST SPRING AND TO SAFETY PROTOCOLS. AND UC CAMPUSES THOUGHTFULLY PLANNED LIMITED CAMPUS OPERATIONS AND REGULARLY TESTED STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES YOUR ON SITE. AND HELP TO SET UP SYSTEM FOR TRACING AND QUARANTINE. AGAIN THERE MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS I'LL SHARE JUST A FEW OF. THE RETURN TO LEARN PROGRAM AT UC SAN DIEGO PROVIDE STUDENTS AND CAMPUS WILL EMPLOYEES THREE WEEKLY SELF ADMINISTERED TEST. FROM VENDING MACHINES OR DRIVE THROUGH TESTING SITES. THERE'S ALSO BEEN THE CAMPUS INFECTION RATES FOR THE FALL TERM. WERE WELL BELOW 1% FOR THE ENTIRE TERM AND ROUTINELY BELOW ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT. EVEN WITH THE POST HOLIDAY SURGE THE POSITIVITY RATE REMAINS EXTREMELY LOW COMPARED TO THE RATE AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. AS OF JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH THE- JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH THE STATE'S FOURTEEN DAY AVERAGE WAS ABOUT CAMPUSES ARE GROWN ACROSS ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES LAST WEEK THE RATE RANGE FROM ABOUT ZERO POINT 6% 21% OF THOSE RACING IMPACTED ROBBING SO I'M VERY. PLEASED TO SAY THAT WITH THE GROWING AVAILABILITY OF COMMON VACCINES WE INTEND TO RESUME IN PERSON COURSES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE FALL. YOU'RE ALSO MARKED A NATIONAL RECKONING ON THE ISSUE THAT IS DEEPLY IMPORTANT TO THE UNIVERSITY. IT TO ME PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY THAT IS THE IMPACT OF SYSTEMIC RACISM ON OUR COMMUNITIES. HAVE YOU THE ROLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION AS AN EQUALIZER. CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF INCOME LEVEL LEVEL REGARDLESS OF RACE REGARDLESS OF GENDER REGARDLESS OF OTHER FACTORS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I KNOW THAT WHEN I BEGAN MY EDUCATION SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE SEGREGATED. IN CALIFORNIA THE MASTER PLAN PROVIDED A CLEAR WAY FORWARD FOR INDIVIDUALS LIKE ME WHO OR OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED OR OR OR OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED. YEAH I ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AS A GRADUATE STUDENT I MAKE COMMITTED- COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF ARE ABLE TO SEEK HIGHER EDUCATION IN A VARIETY OF- THE FURTHER HIGHER EDUCATION VARIETY OF INSTITUTIONS. SUCH AS OURS. IT IS CERTAINLY- THROUGH INCLUSIVE AT INCLUSION INCLUDES ACTIVITIES INCLUSION THAT YOU SEE WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE UP TO ITS IDEALS OF ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND EXCELLENCE. I'M ALSO DETERMINED TO STRENGTHEN OUR RELATIONSHIP IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE IS A CALIFORNIA IMAGE THREE OUT OF FOUR TRANSFER STUDENTS TO APPLY TO YOU SEE FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND ROLES ROUGHLY ONE TRANSFER STUDENT FOR EVERY TO NADER FRESHMAN. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING OUR TRANSFER STUDENTS AND A JOINT UC COMMUNITY COLLEGE TASK FORCE IS EXAMINING THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF AN AGREEMENT TO ENHANCE TRANSFER INCLUDING SHARING DATA ON STUDENT ELIGIBILITY AND HOW BEST TO COMMUNICATE WITH TRANSFER STUDENTS AND HOW TO MAKE TRANSFER PATHWAYS EVEN MORE ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS IN THE FUTURE. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DEGREE PROVIDES ONE OF THE BEST VALUES IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY. AND IN COMBINATION WITH THE STATE'S TRULY EXCELLENT SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS THROUGH CAL GRANT. YOU SEE ALSO PROVIDES VERY SIGNIFICANT NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID FOR UC'S STUDENTS. I'M COMMITTED TO REDUCING STUDENT DEBT LEVELS THROUGH FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS AND THROUGH EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME IMPROVEMENTS. WE SHARE WITH YOU THE GOAL OF HELPING MORE STUDENTS GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS OR TWO YEARS FOR OUR TRANSFER STUDENTS. WE'RE PROUD OF OUR GRADUATION RATES WHICH EXCEED THOSE OF NEARLY EVERY PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY. WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE MEASURABLE PROGRESS IN GRADUATION RATES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. LIMITING GAPS IN DEGREE ATTAINMENT WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SUSTAIN RESOURCES AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR ON GOING SUPPORT. THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROPOSAL SUPPORTS THESE PRIORITIES AND REVERSES SOME OF THE DEEP CUTS UC'S SUSTAINED THIS YEAR. UNIVERSITAS FUNDING REDUCED BY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET ACT FOR NEXT YEAR WE'RE RESTORE ONE THIRD OF THAT AMOUNT AND THE STATE BANK ONE THIRD OF THAT ABOUT. STATE REVENUES EVER COVERED WE BELIEVE IT IS CRUCIAL TO FULLY RESTORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES CALL GOOD IMPOSED ON OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE STUDENTS. WILL NEED ACADEMIC AND STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES NOW MORE THAN EVER. ALSO GRATEFUL THAT THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE UC PROGRAMS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION ALSO KNOWN AS PRIME. TO EDUCATE DOCTORS WHO WILL CARE FOR PATIENTS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. YOU SEE WOULD USE A PORTION OF THESE FUNDS TO LAUNCH TWO NEW PRIME PROGRAMS. TO EXPAND MEDICAL EDUCATION. ONE OF WHICH WILL BE FOCUSED ON SERVING AMERICAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES I'M I'M REALLY I'M HAPPY TO SEE THE PRIME PROGRAM CONTINUE TO GROW WHEN I WAS FIRST IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THE VICE PRESIDENT. FOR HEALTH PROGRAMS OUT TWENTY YEARS AGO WE LAUNCHED THE PRIME PROGRAMMING IT WAS- GREAT- AT A PHOTOGRAPH OF MYSELF FOR THE FIRST EIGHT GRADUATES AND WAS GREAT TO THEN PUT THAT PHOTOGRAPH NEXT TO A PICTURE THAT WE TOOK LAST YEAR ON THE FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY. OF OUR TOGETHER WITH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CURRENT PRIME STUDENTS AND SO WE'RE PROUD OF HOW WELL THAT'S WORKING AND LOOKFORWARD TO EXPANDING THAT PROGRAM. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES STUDENT BASIC NEEDS FUNDING. TO SUPPORT STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY NEEDS. AS WELL AS PROVIDING ONE TIME EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID DO YOU SEE STUDENTS. A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FUNDING AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WILL ALLOW YOU SEE. TO ADDRESS URGENT ISSUES AND REDUCE CAMPUS RELIANCE ON THE ELECTRICAL GRID. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE. BY SAYING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO THRIVE NOT JUST SURVIVE. IN THIS UNIQUE MOMENT IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. SO WE ARE RESPECTFULLY ASKING THAT YOUR SUPPORT WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S INTRODUCED. AUGMENTED WITH FULL RESTORATION OF THE PRIOR CUTS AND PROVIDE FUNDS TO ADDRESS UNAVOIDABLE COST INCREASES SO THE UC CAN DO OUR PART FOR STUDENTS. RESEARCHERS JUDGE ARE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND FOR OUR STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONTINUED HELP IN DOING THIS AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS MY REMARKS DISTRIBUTOR. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M PRESIDENT I'M A START WITH MR MEDINA CHAIR OF OUR ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO ECHO OUR CHAIRS- WELCOME TO THE THREE OF YOU- HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH THIS. AND I HAVE A TWO QUESTIONS- OF BOTH TO UC- VERY DIFFERENT QUESTION BUT MY FIRST. TO PRESIDENT DRAKE I WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE EIGHT YEARS AGO. TO THE LEGISLATURE I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN I FOUND OUT. THAT THE FUNDING TO THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES- SIGN UC'S A PER STUDENT FUNDING WAS DIFFERENT- FROM OTHER CAMPUSES SAY- UCLA. CAL BERKELEY. SO THE THREE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE BEEN- ISSUES OF DIFFERENT FUNDING PER STUDENT ARE UC RIVERSIDE UC SANTA CRUZ AND UC SANTA BARBARA. AND- THIS PRE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT- TOOK ON THE TASK OF- TRIED TO CHANGE THAT- WITH THE PRICES KNOWN AS RE BENCHING- WONDERING IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT AND- WHAT WE WILL DO TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE- INEQUITIES. OF FUNDING. DIFFERENT CAMPUSES DIFFERENTLY. WHERE IT HAS TO SAY ABOUT THEM THEY WERE MEDINA THAT THAT HAVE A TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I- I AM A VERY WITH THE FUNDING STREAM SUCH THAT WERE AND- PARK AROUND TO THOUSAND TWELVE THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND- AND ACTUALLY HAVE AN UPDATE AS OF THIS WEEK OF PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE IN- DOING ALL THAT CAN BE DONE TO ADDRESS THOSE OF FUNDING GOT DISPARITIES. MANY OF WHICH WERE HISTORIC- THEY OLDER CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN FUNDED LONGER AND SO THERE'D BEEN A COMPOUND INTEREST THERE AND THE OTHERS WERE DUBBED DEPENDENT ON THE RIGHT RATIO OF DIFFERENT STUDENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OUT MEDICAL STUDENTS- PERSONS UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO THROUGH WITH YOU AND IN DETAIL- OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. YOU'LL SEE THAT NOW THE FUNDING DISPARITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATES ON THAT DEPENDING ON THE UNDERGRADUATE STATUS HAVE BEEN LARGELY ELIMINATED WE HAVE ON A GOAL OF HAVING ALL OF THE CAMPUSES WITHIN 95% OF THE OF THE MEAN NONE BELOW THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE AND- AND THAT WILL BE ACHIEVED I THINK WITHIN THE NEXT FUNDING CYCLE OR OR SO AND- SO THERE'S BEEN GREAT PROGRESS THERE TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THAT STUDENTS WERE SUPPORTED APPROPRIATELY. CAMPUS THE CAMPUS NOT BE HAPPY TO GO- THROUGH THAT WITH YOU AND IN GREAT DETAIL BUT I THOUGHT VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM THAT'S THAT WILL CONTINUING. OUT AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO. THEY YOU AND I LOOK FOR TO THAT. AND THAT AND I WOULD JUST ADD. THAT THE- SHORTFALL OR THE BUDGET GAPS. THAT ALL THE CAP. ARE FACE. THOSE THREE. CAP THAT I MET. I THINK THERE THEY'RE- BUDGET GAP. EXACT I DO. TWO YOU KNOW THE- FUNDING SO LOOK FOR TO GETTING THE IN. THE MICE. QUESTION AND I HAVE BEEN FOR OF ME THE ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK. THE WEEKEND- HIGHLIGHTED THE WORK IT USED DAVIS. AND I THINK IT'S EXAMPLE OR- KIND NOT ONLY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT TO THE NATION- OF. WHAT OTHER CAMPUSES COULD BE DOING. AND I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR IN YOUR REPORT- RIGHT NOW- THE WORK THAT YOU SEE IT IRVINE IS DOING. IS ALSO GIVING THE VACCINE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. YOU SEE SAN DIEGO HAD ALSO BEEN IN THE PROCESSES OF- GIVING VACCINES ON SOME KIND OF. PERHAPS LIMITED BASIS. IN IN THE CITY THAT I REPRESENT IN MY SIXTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. IN RIVERSIDE IS THERE ANYTHING. THAT WE CAN DO THAT THE STATE COULD NOW. TO EXPAND. ON WHAT THE WORK THE UC DAVIS. UC IRVINE IS DOING MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT YES YOU ARE. THERE ARE. OVER TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS- STAFF THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO OUR LICENSE RIGHT NOW. TO GIVE THE VACCINE. IF THEY HAD THE VACCINE. WHILE THE CAMPUSES ARE CERTAINLY A GREAT PLACE TO DO IT- IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO. HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO EXPAND. IRVINE AND DAVIS ARE DOING. WELL THE OTHER THING YOU VERY VERY AND POINT I THINK IMPORTANT TRY OF US AND- YOU MENTIONED ARE DAVE THAT'S YOUR CELL AND STANFORD. AND GOVERNMENT THE OF THE CAMPUSES WITHOUT MEDICAL POST. AND YOU SEE RIVERSIDE HAS GREAT. TO DO THIS WELL WE AT THE BIG OR THREE FOURTH. THOUSAND THREE THAT. VACCINE DOSES A WEEK I THINK THE NEXT WEEK WE ARE TO RECEIVE TWENTY THOUSAND THAT'S DOSES WILL BE A TO GIVE OUT. WE. EVALUATE ARE. IN BELIEVES WE CAN GET OUT ABOUT AND TO THOUSAND BACK DOES. A WEEK WE HAVE THE STAFF AND PERSONNEL AND THE TO THAT AND SO WE HAVE BEEN EVER. BUT THE STATE AND WE APPRECIATE THE STATE SUPPORT TO INCREASE THE DOSES THAT WE RECEIVED WE RECEIVED THOSE DOSES WHERE THE MOST EFFICIENT IN THE STATE IN GETTING THOSE AS WE RECEIVE. P. ARE AND WE'RE EAGER TO HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE THIS EXTRAORDINARILY AND- OUT AS MORE LIKE. BACKS I I'M SAY THAT- THE STATE HAS BEEN RESPONSE TO HAVE BEEN SLOWER THE WE WISH BUT WE BELIEVE WE'RE GETTING GOOD COOPERATION YOUR SUPPORT HELP US DO THAT- BE- VERY WELCOME AND- WE SAY WE- WOULD LIKE A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOSES ARE WE- YES TWENTY THOUSAND. FOR EACH PLACES WITH THAT. MATTER CENTER AND TWENTIETH FOUR RIVERSIDE WHERE WE ALL HAVE A SCHOOL SO THAT THOSE. THE HUBS FROM WHICH WE WERE. THE FACTORS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DO THAT VERY. PRESIDENT DRINK EVEN THOUGH USE RIVERS DOESN'T AN OP HOSPITAL- IT DOES HAVE YOU SAID THE- SO I YES VERY MUCH LET THIS- YOU. RIVERSIDE ON NOT IT'S- THE BILL. MY NEEDED IN AND OUR WITH THE COUNTY. SET UP- IT'S- FOR. LOOK CITY OF RIVERS WAS NOT ONE OF. SOME PEOPLE HAD TO GO FAR. NOW THE CITY OF RIVERS. IS OPERATE BUT YOU SEE RIVERSIDE. X. WHICH ARE HELP OUR AREA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL SOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE. I COULD TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. ACT THAT I AM A PROUD PRODUCT OF THE UC SYSTEM OF UC DAVIS IN FACT WHICH AS AN ASSA QUITE PROUD THIS WEEKEND OR DURING THE SPEND IRAQ AND I WANT TO ALSO NOTE THAT I AM THE CLASS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO IF THERE ARE STUDENTS CURRENTLY WHO ARE ON WHO JUST GRADUATED TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE ON TRACK TO GRADUATE TWENTY TWENTY ONE I OVERLAPPED WITH THEM OR SKINNER AYE SO I GUESS I DO OVERLAP WITH THEM AND THAT'S HOW TRANSFORMATIVE THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE FOCUS AND THE PRIVATIZATION OF STUDENT BASIC NEEDS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WELL AS THAT REFLECT IN YOUR COMMENTS OF ALL SEGMENT PETERS BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT SENATE BASIC NEEDS HAVE BEEN A VERY BIG CHALLENGE IN AN ISSUE THAT STUDENT LEADERS HAVE BEEN RAISING TO THEIR MINISTRATIONS EVEN PRIOR TO MY START AS A STUDENT LEADER UC DAVIS SO I'M GLAD THAT FINALLY WE'RE GETTING TRACTION AND ABLE TO DRESS THOSE NEEDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. I HOPE THAT COMMITMENT STILSON STILL SAY THROUGH WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP IN ALL YOUR SEGMENTS TO KEEP PRIORITIZING THE VOICE OF STUDENTS WHO OFTEN. ARE TO BE LEYVA AND NOR BECAUSE THEY CAN LEAD AND GRAB. BUT ALSO TO LIST TO THAT BIG THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT YOU'LL IN. FROM CHEN SENATE WEATHER FROM THE GENERATION AFTER. I WITH WELL THE GENERATION AND MINE. SO I HOPE THAT THAT. FOCUS WILL BE ON THERE AND ALSO I DO APPRECIATE ALL UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE SEGMENTS OF HOLDING OFF ON INCREASING ON TUITIONS AND FEES ESPECIALLY DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION. AND MY ONLY QUESTION IS ABOUT IF THERE IS A PLAN. ABOUT RETURNING TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION DURING THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND IF SO- WOULD YOU BE PROVIDING OPTIONAL. VIRTUAL VIRTUAL OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS WHO DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN ATTENDING. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE KNOW WHO. WHO GOES FIRST. I SUPPOSE WHOEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST CONFIRMED I GUESS I'M TALKING SO- CAL OKAY GOVERNMENT OKAY YES I MEAN AREN'T IS HAVE IN PERSON IN. AS MUCH AS IT'S POSSIBLE IN THE FALL- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE I'LL SAY THAT THE WHAT WILL DETERMINE THAT IS HOW EFFECTIVE WE ARE AS A COMMUNITY AS A NATION IN GETTING VACCINES INTO THE ARMS OF PEOPLE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. BE CURRENT PROJECTIONS ARE AT THE CURRENT RATE THAT WE'RE GETTING VACCINES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE- THE RESULT FRACTION OF THE POPULATION VACCINATED BY THE SUMMER SUCH THAT WE CAN GET- THE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH FOR HERD IMMUNITY TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR US TO RETURN LARGELY. THE IN PERSON BUT I BELIEVE THAT MY GET MY COLLEAGUES I KNOW WOULD SAY THE SAME THING THAT WHATEVER THE NEW NORMAL IS GOING TO BE THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS NOT GOING TO BE TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT WE PROVIDE. INSTRUCTION IN SERVICE AND THAT WE KNOW THAT MANY MORE CLASSES WILL BE HYBRIDIZED THERE WILL BE A VIRTUAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXCEED THOSE THAT WERE THE CASE IN THE PAST WE'LL KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS A MONTH TWO MONTHS THREE MONTHS EVEN DOWN THE LINE AS WE SEE HOW THE VACCINATION PROGRAMS ARE GOING BUT OUR OUR GOAL IS TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE VACCINATED AS POSSIBLE BY THE SUMMER. TO ADMIT AS MANY PEOPLE BACK TO OUR CAMPUSES IN THE FALL INTO HAVE INSTRUCTION IN PERSON AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE DON'T EXPECT THEY'LL BE AT THE FULL EXTENT THAT IT WAS A YEAR AGO SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN AND WE'LL LEARN AS WE GO FORWARD AND ENHANCE THEM WITH VIRTUAL- AND AN ONLINE EDUCATION IS A CERTAIN PART. OF OUR FUTURE. HAPPY TO. HAPPY TO JOIN IN- CERTAINLY ECHO- PRESIDENT TRACED COMMA WHAT I WOULD ADD IS. COMMUNITY THE HUNDRED SIXTEEN COLLEGE. WE'LL SEE. BE IN. FORM OF- HYBRID MODE. IT ALL DEPENDS ON- HOW QUICKLY WE CAN GET- FACULTY AND STAFF VACCINATED WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR ANY RETURN. TO CAMPUS- AND CERTAINLY OUR OUR ABILITY TO. SECURE RESOURCES TO PREPARE THE CAMPUS. FOR A SAFE RETURN FOR OUR FOR OUR STUDENTS. BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THEY WILL BE- SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROMOTING ONLINE INSTRUCTION IN THE FALL. HOWEVER WE ARE PLANNING ON BRINGING BACK. MANY OF THE RESOURCES THAT STUDENTS ARE. TYPICALLY AVAIL THEMSELVES- WE WILL HAVE. IN PERSON CLASSES CERTAINLY FOR THOSE. COURSES THAT SUPPORT THE CENTRAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA- WELL AND TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WORKING WITH OUR FACULTY AND OUR CAMPUS LEADERSHIP. BRING BACK AS MANY COURT CLASSES AS POSSIBLE. WITHIN A PHYSICAL DISTANCE SEEN PROTOCOL WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE. WORKING WITH. OUR PARTNERS IN THE OTHER SYSTEMS AND CERTAINLY WITH THE- DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I JUST HAD TO. THE CSU IS ON A LONG THE SAME LINES- AS THE UC AND- I ANTICIPATE THAT- THAT WILL HAVE HOPEFULLY A MAJORITY OF OUR- PERSON INSTRUCTION ON THE CAMPUSES THIS FALL. BUT THAT LITTLE DETERRENT BE DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF VACCINES AND- OUR STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND STAFF BEING INSPIRED TO BE VACCINATED- BUT THERE WILL BE OPTIONS OF COURSE ONLINE HYBRID OPTIONS FOR THOSE. WHO PREFER NOT TO BE ON CAMPUS AND I DO THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE STATE TO- HAVE A CAMPAIGN TO INSPIRE. EVERYBODY TO GET VACCINATED AND I'M HOPING WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO DO THAT- IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS AND THAT WILL HELP US TO ACCELERATE OUR RETURN TO WHAT WOULD BE AT. THE NEW NORMAL IN THE FALL. GOOD THANK YOU I'M GLAD THE SEGMENTS ARE TAKING THESE TAKING CONSIDERATION AND PLANNING APPROPRIATELY SINCE THE RETURN TO CLASSROOMS WOULD MEAN. THE RETURN OF THE AGE THE AGE DEMOGRAPHIC WHICH I'M INCLUDED WHICH IS THE LOWEST PRIORITIZE ATION VACCINE RIGHT NOW THAT'S GOOD. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT NO THANK YOU FOR REMINDING US IN NEW GRADUATED COLLEGE WITH AND- JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE ONE AREA I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS EQUITY OR INEQUITY AND I SINCERELY APPRECIATE- AS THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE SUB TO SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC- IT'S GOOD TO SEE CHANCELLOR OAKLEY AFTER. HEARING ABOUT TWO AND SPEAKING WITH YOU ON MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS A GRADUATE FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE I. HAVE A VERY SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART FOR MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OUR STUDENTS I ALSO AS A AT THE SOCIO PROFESSOR ENGINE PROFESSOR AT THE CAL STATE- I ALSO WILL THINK HIGHLY OF MY CAL STATES I'M SORRY I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE UC'S EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE WONDERFUL BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAGUE GRADUATED FROM. UC BUT THE ISSUE OF EQUITY AND INEQUITIES I THINK IS OF GREAT CONCERN FOR SO MANY OF US AND I SINCERELY APPRECIATE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REQUIRING THAT THESE EQUITY GAPS BE ADDRESSED- CHANCELLOR OAKLEY YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED ACTIONABLE PLANS TO CLOSE THE EQUITY GAP. ARE YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE EQUITABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY A CHANCER CASTRO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED AND YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE NEEDS THAT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO FIX THIS INEQUITY. AND THEN PRESIDENT DRAKE YOU TALKED ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION BEING THE GREAT EQUALIZER- AND THE FACT THAT THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND EXCELLENCE SO MY QUESTION. TO YOU GENTLEMEN IS. HOW DO SYSTEM. HOW DO EACH OF YOUR SO PLAN TO. THE ECHO GAPS IS REQUIRED BY THE% GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND DO YOU HAVE INITIAL THOUGHTS ON BEST PRACTICES IN THIS AREA. I'M A BIT IN FIRST STEP AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU- NUMBER RACE- SO IN THE CALGARY COLLEGES THE ISSUE OF EQUITY IS. OUR NUMBER ONE ISSUE AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- AS YOU MAY KNOW- WE LAUNCHED A CALL TO ACTION LAST YEAR AFTER THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD- AND- IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. ONE OF OUR GOALS ARE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL. IS TO CLOSE AND ELIMINATE. EQUITY GAPS NOT ONLY STATEWIDE BUT- IN REGIONS WHERE WE'VE HAD STUBBORN VERY STUBBORN EQUITY GAPS SUCH AS THE REGION THAT YOU REPRESENT THE INLAND EMPIRE. SO FOR US IT IS REALLY ABOUT REINFORCING THEIR COMMITMENT. IT'S ABOUT SUPPORTING OUR EFFORT TO DIVERSIFY THE FACULTY- BECAUSE AND THE STAFF BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT STUDENTS SEEN THEMSELVES REPRESENTED ON CAMPUS AND IN CLASSROOMS IS IMPORTANT- WE WANT. ALL OF OUR COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICTS TO COMMIT TO ELIMINATING EQUITY CAPS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO DO THAT AND TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT QUITE FRANKLY- WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE IN PLACE IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK BECAUSE CLOSING EQUITY GAPS MAKE MEANS MAKING VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES VERY. COURAGEOUS CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE- USE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. MY MOM AND CERTAINLY- SUPPORTING OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS IS IMPORTANT TO EQUITY AS WELL BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE MORE OF OUR STUDENTS TRANSFER. TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OUR FACULTY AND STAFF ARE DOING. REMARKABLE WORK AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE TRANSFER RATE- MOST OF THOSE GAINS ARE WITH- BLACK STUDENTS IN LATIN EXTRUSIONS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ROOM AT THE CSU AND THE UC SO I THINK SUPPORTING. OF THOSE EFFORTS AND- MAKING IT A PRIORITY FOR OUR STATE. WILL HELP US ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DRIVE- THE EQUITY IMPERATIVE TO DOWN TO THE SYSTEM- IN SUPPORT CLOSING AND ELIMINATING THOSE EQUITY GAPS. THANK YOU. HAPPY TO JUMP AND NEXT TO HER OKAY WITHOUT PRESENT DRAKE YEAH ABSOLUTELY OKAY. EMBER HEY S. I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR CALL AND- WE EMBRACE THE MINDED APPROACH THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TAKEN AND HAS BUDGET. AND THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO WAYS IN WHICH I VERY MUCH WANT TO FOCUS ON EQUITY HERE MY FIRST YEAR- THE FIRST ONE- RELATES TO- THE EQUITY GAPS THAT EXIST IN OUR- GRADUATION. RATE DATA UP AND DOWN STATE AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THOSE GAPS DOWN TO IS CLOSE TO ZERO AS POSSIBLE AS WE LEFT UP THE GRADUATION RATES FOR EACH. OF OUR CAMPUSES AND- IT'LL BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER IN THAT PROCESS YOU ASKED ABOUT HOW THAT COULD BE DONE IN TERMS OF PRACTICES. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT AT THE- THERE ARE SO CAMP THAT. CLOSE THOSE GAPS DOWN TO ZERO IN A PAL AREA OR IN- UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENT AREA AND OTHERS THAT HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN THERE SO I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LEARN TOGETHER- WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. AND THEN SECONDLY- PRESENT DRAKE MENTION THIS IN HIS REMARKS I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER. AROUND DIVERSITY OF FACULTY AND THINKING ABOUT OUR OUR PATHWAYS IN PIPELINES AND CRAPS AND EVEN MORE CREATIVE THAN A ROBUST WAY AND MY HOPE IS THAT OVER TIME WE CAN. ADD TOGETHER ALL OF OUR LEADERS WORKING TOGETHER CAN DIVERSIFY OUR FACULTIES SO THAT THEY BETTER REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENTS- SO THOSE ARE TWO PARTICULAR WAYS THAT I'D LIKE TO. FOCUS ON ON EQUITY HERE AND IN THE FIRST YEAR TO. THANK YOU MAYBE A COUPLE OF QUICK- THE FIRM TO DO FINISH UP AND AGAIN. YOU KNOW LIKE NOW I HAVE WORKED- DOES. IN TOGETHER THE ISSUE FOR BOB LITERALLY FOR TODAY. AND WE ARE BOB TO CAN THAT WORK ACT TOGETHER AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE'VE HAD- THEY ACTUALLY PARTICULARLY AS WE FOCUS ON EQUITY GAPS. SPECIFIC PROGRAMS ON OUR CAMPUSES IN THE NIGHT. THAT WAS AWAY FROM THE AVERSA CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS WERE WORKED ON- PROGRAMS NATIONALLY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS AND IMPROVE. GRADUATION RATES AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THAT WORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD TO TRY TO HAVE AN ELIMINATION OF EQUITY GAPS IN ALLTHE WAYS THAT THEY THEIR CURRENT. AND IT'S ACTUALLY WE THIS IS WHAT I WANT OF CONGRESS FOR US WE WERE VERY ACTIVE. FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO AND IT'S REALLY QUITE. GRATIFYING TO SEE THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE FROM SAY TWENTY TEN AND TILL TODAY ON NARROWING GAPS ON INCREASING GRADUATION RATES AS WE INCREASE DIVERSITY AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT WORK ON THE IN THE FUTURE AND LOOK VERY MUCH. FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH YOU AND HAVING YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU IF I MAY YES. THANK I THINK THAT. THE THEME ALL. AS FAR AS I SEE. IS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN. AND YOU HAVE TO BE A- BECAUSE NOT TO HAVE- WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THOSE. AND COURAGEOUS DECISION. ABOUT MO FUND FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER. THOSE ARE COURAGEOUS DECISIONS THAT HAVE TO BE MADE. BUT IF THE PLAN IS TO WORK ON EQUITY. AND IT IS INTENTIONAL I KNOW WE WILL ACHIEVE IT. SO I THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL THREE OF YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER VIA THAT IS. I THANK YOU PRESIDENT JACOB CHANCELLOR- CASTRO AND CHANCELLOR OAKLEY I AM HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN A STUDENT EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOUR SYSTEMS AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER WE DIDN'T TAKE THE TRADITIONAL PATH AND I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY. AS MY PATH WAS DIFFICULT AS A MATTER OF FACT- BECAUSE OF A TRANSFER OF UNITS- DIDN'T COMPLETE MY DEGREE BY A CLASS AND THAT WAS ALSO THE TIME WE'RE FINE THERE'S FINANCIAL STRAIN ON MY FAMILY THERE WAS TRAGEDY. AND THIS IS WHAT SO MANY STUDENTS ARE DEALING WITH AT THIS VERY MOMENT SO I AM A LITTLE CURIOUS IS THERE ARE CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE A DROP IN GRADUATION RATES HOW WHAT ARE WE DOING SPECIFICALLY TO INTERVENE NOW TO ENSURE. THAT STUDENTS ARE COMPLETING THEIR DEGREES- AND I HAVE A FEW OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS AS WELL BUT I WOULD LOVE TO KIND OF JUST GET THE REAL THE REAL PICTURE THE REAL NUMBERS THAT WHAT WE THINK WE MAY BE LOOKING AT. I WILL START- SINCE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION- IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE NATION ABOUT- COMMITTEE COLLEGE ENROLLMENTS AND IN THE DROP THERE WE'VE BEEN SEEN NATIONALLY. THE BIGGEST ISUE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IS RECOGNIZED IN THE ECONOMIC TOLL THAT THIS PANDEMIC IS TAKEN ON THEM. RECOGNIZING THAT SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE TO JUGGLE MULTIPLE PRIORITIES TRYING TO FIND WORK MANY OF THEM ARE HAVING TO WORK IN FRONT LINE JOBS PUTTING THEIR LIFE AT RISK IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR EDUCATION. I'M HAVING TO. RAISE THEIR CHILDREN- AND INSTRUCTION FOR THEIR CHILDREN DURING THE PANDEMIC SO THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT OUR STUDENTS SPACE IS ECONOMIC SO THAT IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET AS MUCH EMERGENCY SUPPORT TO THEM AS POSSIBLE WE'VE- ADVOCATED FOR THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IN THE PREVIOUS- STIMULUS THE CURRENT SEAMLESS IN THE PROPOSED MILEST- WE ALSO ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY AID FOR STUDENTS. A BEYOND THAT OUR COLLEGES ARE REACHING OUT TO OUR STUDENTS TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO SUPPORT THEM TO HELP THEM CONTINUE TO STAY IN ROLE. WHILE SOME STUDENTS HAVE COMPLETELY LEFT US IN THE NEAR TERM- MANY OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE JUST TAKEN LESS CLASSES SO THAT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. AND WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM TO RECOVER AND THERE ARE RESOURCES IN THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO HELP US REACH OUT TO THEM AND GET THEM TO CONTINUE TO STAY IN ROLE TO HELP THEM- TAKE COURSES NOT JUST THIS SPRING BUT IN THE SUMMER AND HELP THEM CATCH UP- AND THEN- FINALLY. I WOULD SAY THAT- ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES OUR STUDENTS FACE IS A LACK OF ACCESS TO BROADBAND. WELL WE'VE TRIED TO PUT A BANDAID ON THAT PROVIDED THEM WITH EQUIPMENT PROVIDE THEM WITH LOW COST PLANS OR WAR. MY FIGHTS. OUR STATE DOES HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS CHALLENGE. THAT MANY OF OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. HAVE VERY INADEQUATE ACCESS TO BROADBAND WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE MEANINGFULLY IN THEIR INSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW. I DO HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION IF YES OF COURSE SO I'M- IT'S THIS IS MOSTLY FOR- YOU SEE AND UCLA I'M SORRY. DID I JUST SAY GO BRUINS DIDN'T DO THAT INTENTIONAL TODAY. YOU SEE WHAT END- WELL OKAY PARTICIPATE IN THE DOOR AND MAY AND PATH. AND HOW DO SEE S. YOU AND YOU SEE ENTERED ALLAH THE NEW AND SLOTS. BETWEEN CAN. WOOD ADMISSION BE SPECIFIC- ARE LIMITED BY MAJOR. WE SAW A COUPLE OF- WHAT IS THAT WE ARE- STILL WE HAD A MISSION. A FEW YEARS AGO WE'VE MOVED- THE- THE IT TO BE I DO WAYS OF AN ALBUM HAND SAYING- THE ADMISSION OF. STUDENTS BUT I'M CERTAINLY WILLING LOOK AT REINSTITUTING THE PATH INTO WHAT WE CAN DO SO IT THE SUFFERS WITH THE A WE TO AND- THE ABILITY OF TO TRY. TO THOSE YOU. THAT AS YOU MAY HAVE THE THAT'S- TAKE- AT TRAIN INTO. TO BE BROUGHT THE COUNTER PROBE TORE- MAJOR ENTERED. I TIME AND TO WE CAN TO GET AS MANY OF US DO TO START FRESHMEN. GRADUATE INFO YEARS THE GUY NUMBER THAT WOULD OUR STUDENTS TO PAY INDUSTRY DON'T. TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE IN TWO YEARS CAMPUS TO. CAN PASS FOR MAY THE PEN ON A PER OF THINGS. AND SO THEY'RE THE SOMETHING THAT WE IS OUR CAMPUS CAMPUS- I DECISION OR MAYBE ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF AND FOR. AND LABS THAT WANT FOR ANOTHER AND SO THE PEN ON THE MAJOR THE ONE IS LOOKING. THAT AND DIFFERENT HAVE DIFFERENT. THERE'S CERTAIN ALL THE DON'T HAVE THE MAJORS THEY OFFER SORRY ARE OUR GOAL REALLY IS TO GO THE NUMBER OF OPERA FOR STUDENTS. THE ALTHOUGH WE UNDER THAT THERE ARE CAMPUS THE CAMPERS. THANK A MEMBER MAY I AM A ANSWER EARLIER QUESTION I'M SORRY JUMP BEFORE YOU ASK THE ONE- ABOUT THE CHALLENGES. FACING OUR STE. AND WHAT I CAN SAY YOU IS THAT- SO FAR- WE HAD A HIGHER. RATES THAN WE HAD BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THAT'S A GOOD THING- BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE STRESS THAT EVERYBODY IS EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW AND- I DO APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT AND BASIC NEEDS AND- AND SUPPORT FOR OUR STUDENTS- CHAIRMAN. IS GONNA CARRY A BILL THAT WOULD CALL FOR ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN. BETTER SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL DURING THE PANDEMIC AND AFTER THE PANDEMIC. MAYBE IT FORGIVE ME I'VE GOTTEN AND I COULD INTRODUCE THEM A BIT TO THAT AS WELL THERE'S THE FOLLOWING. CASH AND YOU KNOW THE SEARCH FOR ALL OF US ARE ARE THAT THE ARE DIFFERENT. I WILL SAY FOR US. THAT THAT WE HAVE DUG ARE GREAT ENROLLMENT THIS FALL THEN WE DO IN- THE PAST WE HAD AN INCREASE IN CAL. STUDENTS WHO ENROLLED THAN US MADE UP OF IN SOME OF THE- ANOTHER STUDENT. AND- BUT WE HAD A AND IN CAL STUDENTS SO THAT WAS A INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND WE'VE SEEN. INCREASE IN OUR APPLE- THIS YOU CAN. ABOUT THE LACK YEAR ACTUALLY THE- AB FIFTEEN OR SO PERCENT AND ACROSS. INCREASE IN WITHIN. WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE HAD BEEN IN. OF ABOUT 21% AFRICAN. APPLICATIONS INCREASE IN ABOUT 12% AND A DINO APPLICATIONS AN INCREASE OF 5% IN TRANSFER APPLICATION SO ALL OF THOSE GROUPS THAT HAVE APPLIED. IN IN GREATER NUMBERS AND ARE GRADUATION RATES AND RETENTION RATES ARE. AT ALL TIME HIGHS SO THAT THE WORK OF FOCUSING ON AND HONESTLY. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT- IS. TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE ECHO AND- GAPS THAT WE HAVE. OF THE AS ARE STILL ARE ABLE TO GRAB. GOT MORE THAT THAT LEVELS MORE CONSIST WITH THE HIVE GRADUATE RATES WE'RE SEEING IN THE PAST. AS WE WILL ELIMINATED THOSE EQUITY GAPS WE GET LARGER NUMBERS OF STUDENTS. GRADUATING BEING SUCCESSFUL THAT THERE REQUIRES A- THE CONTINUAL INVESTMENT IN STUDENTS AND STUDENT SUCCESS. AND I ECHO MIKE MIKE MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE STUDENT NEEDS THOSE STUDENTS SUPPORT THOSE THINGS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AS WE HAVE A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY AGAIN WITH WITH US THE MOST DIVERSE STUDENT BODY THAT WE'VE HAD. IN OUR HISTORY AND TO WORK ON HELPING ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE TO BE. THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THEIR THEIR BASIC NEEDS AND IN PARTICULAR JUDGE LOCALS COMMENTS I THINK ARE SO IMPORTANT THAT IS THAT. THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EOPLE FIND IN THEMSELVES IN IN THE WORLD. ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED WHEN THEY'RE INVOLVED IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OUR LENDS OPEN WIDE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND. THAT WE GET HOLD PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTING THEM- THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION MEANS BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS THAT. THEY HAVE POPPED OUT FROM THE REAL WORLD. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU S. MEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. ALSO WANNA EXTEND BY WELCOME TO. PRESIDENT REAGAN CHANCE FOR CASTRO I WAS JUST REFLECTING ON THE OUTGOING MESSAGES OF YOUR TWO PREDECESSORS AND I THINK IT- REMINDED ME OF THE WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS ABLE TO DO WITH EACH OF YOUR TWO PREDECESSORS- WHEN PRESIDENT POTONG L. DECIDED TO RETIRE. SHE TALKED ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT UP KEY INCENTIVES THE SIGNIFICANT UPTICK. IN STATE CALIFORNIA STUDENT ENROLLMENT OVER HER TENURE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WORKED WITH HER SPECIFICALLY IN VERY CLOSELY ON AND WE WERE VERY PROUD TO DO THAT- WHEN. CSU CHANCELLOR LIGHTLY HE ABOUT TE IMPROVEMENT OR A D. GOALS TO IMPROVE THE FOUR YEAR IN THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE OBVIOUSLY THAT CONTINUE TO BE A FOCUS OF WHAT WE WANT TO WORK ON- WITH WITH THE CSU AND OBVIOUSLY- CHANCELLOR OAKLEY IS- SORT OF NOW THERE'S THE SENIOR PERSON BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU AND WE CONTINUE TO. MAKE HIS ALL BUT WILL NOT NOT NOT TO PARTICIPATE BUT IN TERMS OF TRYING- WE WILL TALK ABOUT A- IN THIS FOR- SO IT IS YOU KNOW IT A REMINDER FOR US BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE VERY SO. OF BOB THE COMMUNIQU WE OFTEN I ALWAYS THAT THERE THE REAL BACKBONE ABOUT HIGH AVERAGE SYSTEM AND FOR. AS AS YOU SEE IS. R. I. IT'S A THE KEY CALL THAT SET THIS APART FROM THAT IT THE REALLY A- HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT IS- BUT BUT GOING TO. THE ISSUE AROUND A ROLL IN MISSION THAT YOU THINK WE'RE ALL TO ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LIKE TO START CHESTER DRAKE. I'M ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE LIKE AGAIN WE WERE A PRESS APOLLO ON HIS TRY TO IN. OUR THE PERCENTAGE OF. IN STATE IN ROME AS AS YOU MAY WERE THE PROBABLY ABOUT THE TIME WHEN OU LEFT OHIO. ON IN STATE ENROLLMENT ACROSS THE SYSTEM PILOTED FIVE TEN PER. AND NOW. BECAUSE BAD. THE LET'S AND YOU SEE IT'S A FOR AS A CAP WITH WE DIFFER DIDN'T- WANTED TO SEE AS A ASPER GOAL BEFORE MANY OF THE- UNITS CENTER SYSTEM THAT WERE ON. THAT OVERALL CAN SAW AS A GO RATHER THAN- AS THAT TO BE CAUGHT. SO ON. IN IN YOUR MIND- SORT OF NEEDS TO BE. TO REPAIR. BADGE BUT WHAT HE'S BE DONE TO BADGE. SO THAT CAN GET TO- INSURE ACCESS FOR CAL HAS STUDENTS. I THANK YOU VERY PROBABLY. MENTION THE TO ONE- SORT OF- FRESH TO TRANSFER RATIO WHICH THE LEDGES. TO GOVERNOR BROWN. ALSO BUT YOU KNOW TO TELL US HOW WE CAN. ENSURE ACCESS A FOR CALIFORNIANS YOURS LIKE MICHAEL OF US AROUND THE TABLE- TO. THE UNIVERSITY CAL. WELL THANK VERY MUCH NUMBER TWO YOU KNOW THE- WHAT ARE INTERESTED BEEN AND WHAT HAPPENED OVER THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS BEEN. THE NUMBER OF THAT WE HAVE A BIG FOR K. STUDENTS HAVE CONTINUE TO IN. AND SO WE LIKE BEING MORE EFFICIENT WOULD LIKE OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE OUR CAPACITY GROW SO THAT WE CAN EDUCATE MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS I KNOW THAT- SINCE I LEFT THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NONRESIDENT STUDENTS AS AS WELL BUT- IT WASN'T NON RESIDENT STUDENTS VERSUS CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THAT WAS THAT. BOTH GROUPS- INCREASED AND OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO MEET OUR IN ROLE MODELS IN FACT I KNOW WE HAVE A EXCEEDED OUR GUARD FOR NEW- DODD STUDENTS OVER THE LAST. LAST YOUR THEN WE WANT TO GET. OUT TO SUPPORT CAL STILL GROW. AND OTHER THING THE I LIKE THINK WE WANT TO DO THAT REALLY IN AND THAT WE WORKED ON. HERE BEFORE I LEFT- OF IT AND MY TIME THAT DOOR AND THEN WELL IT WHILE I WAS GONE AND THAT WE SAW WE SAW GREAT PROGRESS WAS A- TIME TO. AND BY IN TIME FILM PLANT LOW MORE RIGHT TO COME BE A- AND LEAVES- WITH THEIR DEGREE AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS- THAT ARE UNDER WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THAT HELP STUDENTS TO GET THEIR DEGREES ON TIME. INCREASE THEIR GRADUATION RATES AND SHORTENING TIME DEGREE WHICH AGAIN ALLOW FOR MORE STUDENTS TO BE TO BE EDUCATED. I SAY ALSO THAT AS WE MOVE TO BE MORE IN LINE WHICH IS REASSURING MOTOR MORE ONLINE EDUCATION MORE TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED EDUCATION WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THAT CAN HELP TO SMOOTH THE PATHWAY TO A DEGREE AND WE WANT TO. BE A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM IN AND IN THOSE WAYS AS AS WELL AND THEN CONTINUE TO GROW. SO YOU YOU ASK HOW YOU CAN HELP IN THE WAYS THAT YOU'VE HELPED IN THE PAST BY HELPING SUPPORT US IN SUPPORTING OUR GUARD CORPS BUDGET. ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE FACT THAT THE ALLOW US TO HELP THE- AND THE SUPPORTED TECH FOR US TO COME THE CLASS. GRADUATE AND OUT THERE AND- THERE WILL FOR INSTEAD. AND SOME OUR CAN. LET ME SAY ALSO THE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SAW AT. IN IN. IS OKAY SUCCESS IN THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND GREAT SUCCESS AT THE K. THE YOU. SYSTEM IN. UP FOR TO STOP IMPROVING THE ISSUE PARTICULAR HAD WAS AMONG THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY. GRADUATION RATES AND SO WE SEE ALL THESE AS AS- WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE THEIR MAKE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO COME TO. GET AN EDUCATION AND MOVE OUT INTO THE WORK FORCE AND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE TO ME JUST FOLLOW UP WITH A FEW. QUESTIONS AND A COUPLE COMMENTS SO- US HOW WE CAN SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY AND- WE COULD. FIRST AND FOREMOST- BY INCREASING THE- BUDGET- AUGMENTATION WHICH I THINK IS FINE. DURING MY TENURE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH STARTED- THE END OF TWENTY TWELVE WE HAVE INCREASED OUR EXCEPT FOR LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST TIME. INCREASE UC'S BUDGET EVERY SINGLE YEAR- BUT DURING THAT TIME WE DIDN'T SEE. THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN IN STATE ENROLLMENT IN FACT WE SAW. IN STATE ENROLLMENT IN SOME YEARS DECLINE AND THIS IS ALL DURING YOUR- TIME THAT YOU WERE GONE- AND UNFORTUNATELY. AT THE THREE CAMPUSES THAT WERE THE MOST COMPETITIVE- SAN DIEGO BERKELEY AND UCLA. WE'VE SEEN. HOW OF STATE ENROLLMENT SKYROCKETED TO THE POINT I THINK IT'S AROUND 23224% I FORGET EXACTLY ROUGHLY- ON. WHERE THAT IS TO WHILE. I'M WITH. SOME RESPECTFULLY DOES JUST CAN DISAGREE WITH YOUR STAY THAT. WATER WASN'T COME. TO NON RESIDENT IN RESIDENT BECAUSE AT THE THEY'RE VERY MUCH WHAT- COMPETITION. AND UNFORTUNATELY. LOST ON CONSOLE. LET ME JUST DIRECTLY DO YOU. THE EIGHTEEN PER. SHOULD COME DOWN. YOU SAID I THINK YOU SAYING DISAGREE YOU STARTED WITH RESPECTFUL I THINK THEY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE LIKE TO- SO ME SAY THAT THAT I THE BEST YE I KNOW WHAT HAVE THAT YOU SEE IRVINE TO I LAW. IN THOSE YEARS AND I KNOW THAN WHAT HAPPENED THE YEARS THAT I WAS AND IN THE PLACES- YES THERE WAS A INCREASE IN. OUT OF STATE OR NON READ STUDENTS BUT THERE WAS OF COURSE AGREE AND IN IN STATE- US THROUGH AND SO THE OVERALL. EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE DIRECT AND I'M FROM. OVER LOOK BACK TO THE THINGS I READ SOME YEAH THAT WAS A DIFFERENT PLAY OF THE OVERALL- CAL STOOD HERE AND SO BUT THAT I YOUR PROBABLY GO FROM ABOUT IT CAN NOT COULDN'T I COULD SAY THAT. I THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE CREATE OUR FOR K. TO. AND THAT WE KEEP OUR UNIVERSE AS ACT AS CAN CAN BE A- I THINK THAT IT'S A WE'VE HAD A BY PROGRAM UP IN. AS WE INCREASING AGAIN THE PLACE WHERE I BEEN RESPONSIBLE WE INCREASE AS- THE IN STATE STUDENTS MORE- THERE AND- THAT'S WE'VE HAD OTHER STUDENTS COME INTO THE UNIT. OVERALL LARGER AND THAT SOME THAT I COMMIT TO- I MEAN I THINK THAT'S NOT- AND IT THANKS- SENATE JUST USED TO BE SO THAT WE COULD INCREASE. MORE SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIANS. WELL IT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION AS YOU OF COURSE THOUGH AND LET ME SAY THIS THAT'S HAPPENED IN MY AGAIN MY EXPERIENCE. THE- OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS AND YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN A NATIONAL NATIONAL TREND- AS BUDGETS WERE DODD DECREASED BY UNIVERSITY FOR TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE FACULTY STUDENT RATIO IS THE NUMBER OF CLASSES THAT STUDENTS NEEDED TO IN- TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE ON TIME AND THERE WERE- AND THEY FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT WAS TO DIVERSIFY AT THE POOL OF STUDENTS WHO CAME IN PARTICULAR THOSE ARE BROUGHT IN FUNDING FROM OUT OF STATE. AND WHAT HAPPENED AGAIN I USE MY OWN- EXPERIENCE THERE. WHAT WE SAW IS THAT IS WE HAD STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FROM. OTHER PLACES OUT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL. THERE WERE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS TO THE STUDENTS WHO WERE IN. THE CLASSES I. TEACH CLASSES AND WEED OUT OF BENEFIT EDUCATIONALLY FROM PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVES COMING IN. BUT TO YOUR POINT PROP AVERAGES FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THOSE STUDENTS TENDED TO BRING IN MORE FUNDING- THEN THEY ARE COST. AND THEY ACTUALLY WOULD INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR IN STATE STUDENTS AS- AS WELL SO. IF WE WERE A FREEWAY AND WE HAD THREE LANES AND WE HAD THEN- LANE- THAT WAS STUDENTS COMING FROM OTHER PLACES. IT WASN'T WE WENT FROM A THREE LANE. FREEWAY TO A FOUR LANE WENT FROM THREE LANES TO FIVE LANES. AND SO WE HAD MORE LANES FOR IN STATE RESIDENTS. AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAD OTHER STUDENTS COMING IN AND- IT WAS THE WAY THAT WE ACTUALLY BY THE WAY THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE FACULTY TO HAVE. MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR IN STATE STUDENTS SO. I WILL I'M HAPPY TO TALK AS WE CAN TALK MORE OFF LINE ABOUT WHAT THE- THE PROPER BALANCE IS AND- THAT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE PICK MORE REFLECTION BUT- MAILLET. WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WAS TO HAPPEN INCREASED AGAIN CREATION OPPORTUNITIES- FOR STUDENTS FROM BE IN STATE POPULATION. AS WE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER STUDENTS AS AS WELL AND AGAIN SOMETHING I'M I'M HAPPY TO TALK. WITH YOU ABOUT IT IN MORE IN MORE DETAIL RIGHT BUT- WITH ALL. DUE RESPECT PRESIDENT DRAKE DURING DURING THAT TIME JUST TO. CLARIFY UC DIDN'T SEE A DECREASE. IN STATE STUDENT FUNDING AT LEAST FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS THIS ON INCREASE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IN AND AGAIN OUR PROBLEM WAS INTEL WE- INTERCEDED AND FORCED. PRESIDENT APOLLO TONNEAU TO INCREASE IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT IT UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT HAPPEN ON ITS OWN EVEN THOUGH. THE UNIVERSITY WAS GETTING COMMENSURATE BUDGET. INCREASES SUCH THAT IS. PART OF THE CRUX. OF THE PROBLEM AND FOR. I THINK ON. GET- YOU YOU BROKE DOWN THE PROBLEM VERY VERY BECAUSE- VERY SIMPLY COULD SIMPLY ABOUT MONEY- THE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS BRING IN MONEY. THAT THE STATE STUDENTS DON'T. AND THERE IS A FINANCIAL PROPOSITION AND I THINK WE HAVE. IN THE PAST PASSED THE UNIVERSITY TO PROVIDE- INFORMATION OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO- BY THE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS OUT AND I THINK WE CONTINUE TO WATER PURSUE THAT- I THINK THAT QUESTION I DON'T THINK THE STATE IS ANYWAYS. ASKING THE UNIVERSITY TO TAKE A LOSS ON ACCEPTING MORE IN STATE STUDENTS BUT I THINK WE ARE WANTING TO HAVE A REALISTIC- ON. A REALISTIC DISCUSSION- HI I WILL SAY THIS- PUBLICLY BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HIGH I DO BELIEVE- AND I THINK PART OF IT IS BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE AND THE TEN. CAMPUS US. ON THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE REASON THIS NUMBER HASN'T GONE DOWN IS BECAUSE THE CHANCELLOR'S WANTED THEIR FINANCIAL FREEDOM FROM THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. AND IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES FOR FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE- IN FACT THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY GREW SIGNIFICANTLY IN TERMS OF BUDGET AT THE UNIVERSITY WHAT IS YOUR OFFICE. THAT'S WHAT WE SAW THE BIGGEST INCREASE DURING MY- SORT OF EIGHT YEARS LEGISLATURE WAS WE SAW AN EXPLOSION. IN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE WITH- ZERO IMPACT ON STUDENTS OR FACULTY- SO AGAIN MARK MY HOPE IS THAT HE'LL TAKE A HARD LOOK AT. FIGURE OUT HOW YOUR OFFICE CAN BETTER SERVE ON. THE DIFFERENT TEN CAMPUSES OR OTHER DOT ORG ITSELF IS FOR FIND A WAY TO SUPPORT. THE TEN CAMPUSES SO THAT WE COULD. REALLY CONTINUE TO. ON ON. FOR HOW BEST SERVE YOU KNOW YOUR STUDENTS YOUR FACULTY OR STAFF. ON IT I DON'T NONE OF THESE ARE ISSUES THAT YOU BROUGHT FOR SAKE I DO WANT TO BE CAREFUL YOU KNOW CLARIFY. THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED WITH YOUR WITH YOUR PREDECESSOR AND I KNOW THAT. YOU HAVE BROUGHT- SORT OF A WHOLE NEW. MIND SET BUT WE REALLY DO URGE YOU AS YOU EMBARK ON YOUR YOUR TEN YER TO REALLY TAKE A HARD LOOK AT MANY OF THESE. ARE VERY VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AND I DO WANT TO. DISCUSS THEM IN A PUBLIC FORUM BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN A PUBLIC FORUM IN THE PAST. ARMED SO TO THE LAST QUESTION. GO AHEAD PLEASE JUST COME IN JUST TO SAY SOMETHING I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE CLOSE THE FIRST I HEAR CLEARLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I. APPRECIATE THAT. AND I WILL SAY AGAIN THAT MY- I MET AT MY OWN LIVED EXPERIENCES THAT WE WORKED TO AND HAD TO DO JUST THOSE THINGS THAT WE WORK ACTUALLY TO- USE THAT INCREASE FUNDING. AT THE CAMPUSES THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TO ADDRESS THE INTEREST THAT THAT THAT YOU MENTIONED. AND I YOU KNOW I YEAH. I WOULD NOT SAY NOTHING ABOUT MY ANY OF MY- ESTEEMED PREDECESSORS. IF MY- CAMPUSES DON'T THINK THAT I ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE THEIR THEIR- STUDENTS THEN WE'LL DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT I'M I'M THERE'S NO WE'RE HERE. I BY CAME BACK TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENHANCING THE WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY DOES THE OFFICE IS NOT THE- THE OFFICES THE FACILITY- BUT THE WORK IS REALLY THE WORK OF THE FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS. AND WORKING WITH THE CHANCELLOR FOR THAT AND OF THE CHANCELLOR'S UNDERSTATE THE CHAPTERS WOULD FEEL THAT THERE'S A COMPETITION BETWEEN THE WORK THAT I'M DOING AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IF THEY DIDN'T FEEL THAT I WAS A- PARTNER. AT HELPING THEM TO DO THAT THEN I WOULD. SAY THAT WE SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENT. ARRANGEMENT BUT I WOULD I WOULD- HOPE THAT THE FEEL THAT THAT'S THE CASE. YOU ARE WHAT WE'RE TO BE DOING GOING FOR THEN WE- REALLY DO I THINK THE SAME. INTERESTS IN MIND AND WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU IN IN DOING THAT AND- SO THAT'S THAT'S THE MINDSET THAT WE BROUGHT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT TO DO AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT. I WOULD JUST READ I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU'RE THE- FRANKLY THE PERFECT PERSON FOR THE JOB AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME AND YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU SEE THAT STAFF. YOUR BEING- A FORMER CHANCELLOR UC IRVINE BUT ALSO YOUR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT- YOU KNOW I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT- YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY. WAS VERY EXCITED WHEN YOU WERE HIRED BECAUSE I THINK- ONE I WAS EXCITED THAT WE FINALLY HAVE A YOU SEE PRISON RUNNING YOU SEE AGAIN. AND THAT'S NOT AS A AS A PRODUCT OF YOU SEE THAT MAKES ME VERY PROUD. BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL AND AT THE FACULTY LEVEL AND I THINK- IN MY OPINION THAT'S SORT OF WHAT'S BEEN MISSING. IS HIS NOT SENSITIVITY TO REALLY WHAT HAPPENS. IN THE CLASSROOM. AT THE CAMPUSES I HAVE BEEN SO IMPRESSED BY. YOUR ATTENTION EXERCISE I DON'T AS I KNOW YOU ARE BECAUSE THE THOSE WERE YOU ALL YOUR FORMER COLLEAGUES. ON SORT OF HOW WELL THEY EACH KNOW. THEIR CONSTITUENTS WITH THERE'S THE FACULTY WHETHER TO STAFF WHETHER TO STUDENTS WAS THERE'S A COMMUNITY. AND REALLY HOW BIG A JOB THEY HAVE AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU. DECIDED NOT TO RETIRE AND TO COME DO THIS FINAL JOB IN TO COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA INTO THIS SO I DO. I DO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I WANTED TO JUST ASK ONE QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE FACULTY DIVERSITY AND. AND KIND OF FOLLOW UP WITH THE OTHER SEGMENTS WHICH IS- YOU KNOW WE DID A FEW. A FEW SMALL GRANTS. TO THE UNIVERSITY DO YOU SEE AROUND. DIVERSITY IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'VE GONE QUITE WELL. I DO HAVE TO STAY IN AND- YOU KNOW THIRTY PLUS YEARS SINCE I GRADUATE I DIDN'T GRADUATE IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN. YOU KNOW I GRADUATED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO. AND SO- MY ONE OF MY BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENTS WAS GOING BACK AND LOOKING. IN SINGLE FRANKLY A LOT OF MY CLASSMATES WHO GOT PHD IS WHO WANTED TO PURSUE. FACULTY POSITIONS BUT REALLY TO SEE HOW. LITTLE THE RACIAL COMPOSITION OF THE FACULTY AT UC NOT GET TO SEE A FEW AND A CSU. HAD CHANGED AND- YOU KNOW CAN YOU CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF REALLY WHAT WE CAN DO THAT KIND OF SUPPORT. THAT YOUR EFFORTS FOR GREATER- FACULTY REPRESENTATION. WELL YEAH I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR INTEREST AND- AGAIN YOU KNOW I HAVE A SHARED EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW AND ROGER WAITING FROM UNIVERSITY AND THEN SEEING GOSH- THERE'S CHANGE BUT IT'S AWFULLY SLOW MUCH SLOWER THAN WE- WE WANTED I KNOW WHEN I. FINISHED I GRADUATED UNIVERSITY IN STATE ON FACULTY AND I. EXPECT THE BILL THIS WOULD BE AND I WAS ALWAYS- FORGIVE ME FOR BEING A LITTLE PERSONAL AND ALL THIS IS TRUE FROM AGAIN MIKE MY COLLEAGUES JENNIFER OAKLEY AND- THAT CHANCELLOR CASTRO. IS THAT WE WERE OFTEN THE FIRST TO DO THIS FOR THE FIRST TO DO THAT YOU KNOW T WAS ALWAYS KIND OF BREAKING A THERE. FOR THESE FOR DECADES IT'S ALWAYS THAT YOU EVERY STEP YOU YOU TAKE. AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WELL THAT'S GREAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THEM THE WAY CAME BACK OF A BOAT ON A LAKE WHERE. YOU MIGHT BE FIRST BUT THEN THE- THE- THE- EFFECT IN BACK OF YOU WOULD GET WIDER AND WIDER WITH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COMING. YOU KNOW AS YOU MOVE ALONG AND I KNOW AFTER A FEW YEARS I LOOKED BACK AND WAS MORE LIKE A DASHED LINE YOU KNOW THAT THAT A TRIANGLE I MEAN THERE WAS. WATER AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SO IT'S BEEN A CONTINUAL EFFORT FOR MANY OF US FOR ALL THESE YEARS. TO MENTOR AND SUPPORT AND TO HELP THEIR BE MORE DIVERSITY IN OUR IN OUR FACULTY RANKS AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TO DO THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR FACULTY WE'RE COMMITTED TO REFLECTING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THE INCREASINGLY DIVERSE STUDENT BODIES THAT WE HAVE WITH- PEOPLE WHO COME FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES AND- TO WHOM THEY CAN RELATE THAT MOST EFFECTIVELY ON. AND WILL WILL AGAIN VERY MUCH WELCOME EUROPE YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND I WAS THE PARTNERSHIP OF MY COLLEAGUES AT CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL. THANK YOU OUR DISTRIBUTOR BECAUSE WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT- FACULTY DIVERSITY WE OFTEN HEAR THERE'S NOT THERE'S A LACK OF A PIPELINE. BUT YET SOMEHOW WHEN UCLA NEEDS A QUARTERBACK OR STARTING CENTER THERE'S NEVER A SHORTAGE OF A PIPELINE ITSELF- WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE SAME LEVEL OF RECRUITING- FOR THE RIGHT KIND OF FACULTY AS AS- THE LEVEL OF RECRUITING THAT GOES INTO. PUTTING TOGETHER OUR HIGH LEVEL MATHLETICS PROGRAM SO THANK YOU. JUST GOING TO- CHANCER. AGAIN PRESS. TRADE WE REALLY. YOUR MESSAGES PERSONAL NOT JUST FOR YOU BUT REALLY FOR ALL OF US I THINK AS AS YOU AS YOU SEEN- ALL OF US. ARE PRODUCTS OF YOUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THERE'S NOT ABOUT THAT WOULD BE UP HERE WITHOUT. ANY OF THE SEGMENTS AND SO. THIS IS VERY THIS IS VERY PERSONAL TO US SO WE'RE GLAD THAT IT'S PERSONAL. TO YOU. SO GOING JUST TO- CHANCELLOR CHANCELLOR CASTRO. OWNED WE'VE SEEN A- SLIGHT DROP IN ENROLLMENT- AND HONESTLY YOU KNOW NOT NOT IN YOUR- PREVIOUS SCHOOL FRESNO CA PRODUCTIONS ON UPTICK IN ENROLLMENT. BUT WE'RE- YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO ASSIST. THE SORT OF ENROLLMENT EFFORTS AS WELL AS THE ADMISSIONS OUT REACH WE KNOW THAT WHILE YOU SEE RECEIVED RECORD APPLICATIONS- THE COMMUNICATOR LEDGES AND SEE AS YOU SAW- ADMISSIONS DROP SO WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO TO BE. SORT OF HELPFUL THERE. IT SURE TANG IT'S NICE TO SEE A FELLOW GOLD BEAR YES- WELL I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT ARE. THAT ARE IN ROMAN ACTUALLY WENT UP DURING THIS ACADEMIC YEAR BY ABOUT 1% AND AT SOME CAMPUSES AS YOU SAID FRESNO WAS UP ABOUT 5% BUT AS A SYSTEM WE WERE UP BY 1% AND AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THERE MANY SYSTEMS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT WERE DOWN. TWENTY OR MORE PERCENT SO THAT'S THE GOOD-NEWS. ON THE CHALLENGING SIDE OUR APPLICATIONS WERE DOWN HAVE BEEN DOWN SO FAR BY ABOUT 5% NOW IT'S A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO PREDICT THAT THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO A LOWER ENROLLMENT. IT WILL ALL DEPEND UPON- OUR OUR YIELD RATES AND WE'RE BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE AND- GETTING MORE STUDENTS TO APPLY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE OVER THE WEEKEND BUT IT SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC SOME STUDENTS ARE ARE NOT MEETING THE USUAL DEADLINES AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT- SO WE- FLEXED THEIR- AND I DO BELIEVE WILL PICK UP MORE APPLICATIONS. AND MY HOPE IS THAT BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE FALL IN THE ENROLLMENT PART- THAT WILL BE EITHER AT OR SOMEWHERE NEAR WHERE WE WERE- LAST YEAR LAST FALL- AND THEN OVER TIME I'D LIKE TO. ALONG WITH ALL OF YOU TRY TO GROW THOSE ENROLLMENTS I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO EDUCATE MORE CALIFORNIANS AND GET THEIR DEGREES AND HELP THEM TO BECOME LEADERS. NO NOTHING THANK YOU AND DO YOU ARE YOU- YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO OBVIOUSLY WITH A SLIGHT DROP IN APPLICATIONS THIS YEAR WHAT CAN WE DO TO ASSIST YOU IN YOUR IN YOUR YIELD EFFORTS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO ENSURE. THAT AS MANY PEOPLE CAN YOU KNOW WHO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW WHO WHAT. THE OPPORTUNITY CAN GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL. WELL IT AS A MAN WERE CONTINUE TO BE VERY AGGRESSIVE EACH CAMPUS THROUGH OUR ADMISSIONS OFFICE IS DOING A LOT OF VIRTUAL. CONNECTIONS THERE ARE A COUPLE WAYS THE STATE CAN BE HELPFUL- ONE IS TO WORK WITH US TO GET OUR FOLKS VACCINATED AS- QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I THINK A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE JUST. FRANKLY TIRED OF THE VIRTUAL EDUCATION AND- SOME MIGHT BE SAYING WELL I'LL WAIT A LITTLE WHILE PERHAPS SO. I THINK IF WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER SO THAT AS MANY STUDENTS AS POSSIBLE CAN BE ON CAMPUS. IN THE FALL THAT THAT WILL BE. A TERRIFIC AND THEN. TO MAKE SURE WE ALL HAVE THE FUNDING THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. WHERE THEY'RE AT AND THE FEDERAL MONEY WILL HELP US WITH SOME OF THE EMERGENCY ISSUES BUT- THE CORE OPERATING BUDGETS THAT WE NEED. TO SERVE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WHERE THEY'RE AT AND HELP THEM AS YOU KNOW SOME STUDENTS HAVE. A LITTLE BIT LONGER ROAD TO TRAVEL AND- WHERE YOU KNOW MY JOB AS CHANCELLOR IS TO WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT'S AND- AND THE REST AND THE CAMPUS IS TO TRY TO ACCELERATE. OUR TIME TO A QUALITY DEGREE AND TO ELIMINATE THOSE EQUITY GAP SO YOUR SUPPORT THERE WOULD BE VITALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THE- ENROLLMENT FIGURES I KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR BIG ISSUES AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN BERNARDINO WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS REALLY AROUND SORT OF CLOSING THE EQUITY GAP- AND WHAT I WANTED THAT WIN WITH. THE EQUITY GAP OFFICE OFFICE OFFICE SHOWS ITS BIGGEST GAP IS REALLY AROUND. YEARS TO GRADUATION WHO GRADUATES. SO CAN YOU CAN YOU TALKMORE ABOUT. YOUR PLANS THERE- AS YOU'RE GOING TO AS A AS YOU GO INTO YOUR- PRESENT IDENTICAL TEAR CHANCELLORSHIP. APPS CHAIRED TANK- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE BEEN DIGGING DEEP IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE GAPS LOOK LIKE AT EACH CAMPUS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I PLAN TO DO IS WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT SO NUMBER ONE. WE ALL KNOW. WHERE WHAT THE GAPS ARE NOT JUST AT THE CAMPUS THAT THEY LIED BUT WHAT THE GAPS ARE. AT OTHER CAMPUSES. AND HOW CAN WE WORK TOGETHER YOU KNOW THE- THERE ARE SOME CAMPUSES AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE. TELL GAP DOWN TO YOU KNOW ZERO. AND OTHERS HAVE NOT. THERE ARE OTHER CAMPUSES THERE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE UNDER REPRESENTED GAPS LIKE INFRESNO IT'S DOWN TO. TWO THREE PERCENT. AND OTHERS OR IT'S MUCH HIGHER SO I WANT TO FACILITATE MORE EXCHANGE AN AUTHENTIC WAY TO HELP EACH OTHER. AND WE DO HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT- TOOLS THAT THE CHANCES OFFICES DEVELOP. WHERE I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO SHORTLY GIVE EACH CAMPUS. SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE HOW WE CAN DO. THINGS BETTER IN TERMS OF- ELIMINATING THOSE EQUITY GAPS IN. REACHING OUR AMBITIOUS GRADUATION GOALS. SO THAT THAT WOULD ALL BE PART OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE AND- I'M RECONSTITUTING THE LEADERSHIP GROUP OF THAT AS WELL. AGAIN TO ACCELERATE OUR PROGRESS IN ELIMINATING THE GAPS. AND I WAS SO EXCITED TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT FACULTY DIVERSITY IS ONE OF YOUR MAJOR GOALS- WE HAD TRIED TO WORK WITH- CHANCELLOR WHITE IN HIS OFFICE ON THAT ISSUE WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS AND FORTUNATELY. SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT YOU IN THAT EFFORT- WE ARE YOU KNOW VERY MUCH. HERE TO TRY TO HELP YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR TANG- THIS WAS A TOPIC THAT- CHANCELLOR OAKLEY PRESIDENT DRAKE AND I TOUCHED UPON IN OUR MEETING A WEEK AGO AND- WERE PLANNING TO DO A DEEP DIVE SO I I'D LOVE TO COME BACK LATER AFTER WE'VE HAD. A SOME MORE DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE THINK THAT TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A- FINALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THAT THE HELP IS OFFERED TO ALL THREE ALL THREE SEGMENTS. SUGGEST GOING TO. CHANCELLOR OAKLEY- IT'LL START. THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT WE SEE COMING DOWN THE PIKE- IS IT IS ENROLLMENT FOR DOOR SEGMENT AND JUST WANTED TO- YOU KNOW SORT OF HELP- HELP UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO TO REALLY SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS. WE KNOW THAT DURING A DOWNTURN IT IS- IT OFTENTIMES YOU DO SEE- YOU KNOW THAT. USUALLY DURING A DOWNTURN YOU SEE AND I'M GONNA MAKE A PARTY RIGHT NOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM BUT WE JUST WANT UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP. WITH YOUR- YOUR ENROLLMENT. THANK YOU CARE CHIANG- I THINK. YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A NORMAL DOWNTURN THAT WERE USED TO SEEING- FIRST OF ALL- WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS NOT JUST A DOWNTURN BUT A DIRECT- CHALLENGE TO OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO TWO JOBS THAT ALLOW THEM TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND SO MANY OF THEM HAVE HAD REDUCED HOURS OR OF LOST THEIR JOBS- THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC- CERTAINLY THE HEALTH OUTCOMES ECONOMIC OUTCOMES THE RACIAL RECKONING SO THOSE THESE ARE CHALLENGES FOR OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STUDENTS TO HEART LIKE- CSU OR UC WHERE THEY ARE ADMITTED- TO. CAMPUS WE HAVE OPEN ENROLLMENT SO THEY COME AND THEY GO. A AND WE TRY TO BE AS ACCESSIBLE TO THEM IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ALSO MEANS THAT. AS SOON AS THEY'RE HIT BY- ECONOMIC ISSUES- THEY TEND TO SCALE BACK SO OUR BIGGEST ISSUES ARE ARE THREE THINGS. THAT YOU CAN BE HELPFUL WITHIN YOU HAPPEN HELP WITH ONE IS. WITH THE EMERGENCY AID IT'S IN THIS PACKAGE OUR STUDENTS DESPERATELY NEED THAT AID. TO CONTINUING TO LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN REFORM THE CAL GRANT SAYS THEM TO ALLOW MORE ACCESS FOR STUDENTS TO. TO THE CAL GRANT SAYS THEM. AND THREE. AS SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH- HELPING OR COLLEGES WITH RESOURCES TO GET- DISPLACED WORKERS BACK TO WORK- SO THAT THEY CAN ONCE AGAIN AFFORD TO PARTICIPATE. AND HAVE A FOOTHOLD IN IN IN THE NEW ECONOMY. IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR US AS WE LOOK FOR MORE AND BETTER WAYS TO REACH DISPLACED WORKERS WHETHER THROUGH COUNTY BASED EDUCATION THROUGH THE STRONG WORKFORCE INITIATIVE- BUT BUT THOSE ARE THE THREE AREAS THAT I THINK. YOU CAN BE MOST HELPFUL IN HELPING US REACH OUR STUDENTS AND GET THEM BACK IN OUR CLASSROOMS WHERE THEY WILL REACH VERY EDUCATIONAL GOALS. ABSOLUTELY IF WE CAN I KNOW THAT AT TIMES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO PARTNER ON THE DISPLACED WORKER PEACE IF WE CAN. CONTINUE TO PARTNER MORE- PLEASE LET US KNOW I THINK IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT I THINK- YOUR YOUR SEGMENT PLAYS AN ESPECIALLY CRITICAL ROLE AS YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE CHANGING JOBS ARE SHIFTING INDUSTRIES YOUR COLLEGES ARE REALLY THE FIRST STOP FOR ALL THOSE ALL THOSE FOLKS AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL DURING THIS TIME. THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY AND NO ONE IS TO COMMENT ON IT THAT THAT CAN BE CHAMBER CARD AND I. HAVE BEEN WORKING TO TRY TO SUPPORT YOUR HOUSING EFFORTS WE KNOW THAT- FOR DIFFERENT SEGMENTS HOUSING IMPACTS ALL OF YOU A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY BUT WE KNOW. THAT BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED HOUSING COULD BE A MAJOR ISSUE OR MAJOR COST DRIVER WHETHER STUDENTS COM OR CAN'T COME OR FRANKLY EVEN FACULTY OR STAFF COME. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF AND WE UNDERSTAND ALSO EACH OF THIS EACH OF YOUR SEGMENTS IS UNIQUELY. POSITIONED TO POTENTIALLY ASSIST IN BUILDING. MORE HOUSING AND SO ON. THE CHAIR AND I ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT EFFORTS SO WE CAN DO TO PLEASE SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS MANY OF YOU AND YOUR YOUR CAMPUS IS ALREADY BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU CAN. WORK ON THAT SO PLEASE LET US KNOW- AS AS AS YOU HAVE COME UP WITH MORE SYSTEM WIDE. THINKING WE'D LOVE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THAT SO REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE WITH THE QUESTIONS AND- THANK YOU FOR ALL THREE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU ALWAYS APPRECIATE HAVING OUR BUDGET SHARE INVOLVED. TODAY BUT DO WE HAVE ALL THREE ON THE LINE STILL MARK YEAH. SO I THINK HIT I'M NOT GONNA ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS BUT MAYBE MAKE SOME. SOME POINTS ON ALL THREE AND THEN WE CAN GET TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO. ALSO I'LL START WITH. THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THROUGH THEIR- THAT CHANCE ORTIZ OAKLEY- I TO AS YOU MENTIONED. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FINANCE LATER LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS IS NOT PART OF TODAY'S AGENDA YOU KNOW MR MEDINA. CENTER LEYVA AND I ARE GOING TO BE BACK AT IT LOOKING AT THE CAL GRANT REFORM MEASURE THIS YEAR- BUT WE- YOU KNOW WE WILL BE SEEING THIS PANDEMIC IS HOW MUCH IT'S IMPACTED OUR- LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS CENTER COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT SO. CERTAINLY WELL AWARE OF THAT AND THAT THE BASIC NEEDS- EFFORTS ARE. OUR PRIORITY- WILL BE WORKING WITH JUSTICE INVOLVED STUDENTS WHICH I KNOW YOU ARE SUPPORT OF OUR EFFORT TO. THE FOCUS- RETURNING EVEN INDIVIDUALS FROM OUR CORRECTIONS INSTITUTIONS TO SUCCEED. AND NOT BE A STATISTIC AS FAR AS RECIDIVISM. I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE WHOLE NOTION OF THESE ONLINE COURSES THAT WE WON'T GET INTO THE ONLINE UNIVERSITY TODAY AND I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING TO. LEAVE BUT OVERSEEING THE STUDENTS DROP OUT I THINK THEY WERE SAYING IS THAT IS THAT A BIG PORTION OF THE STUDENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCEED WITH WITH ZOOM UNIVERSITY. AND SO- I THINK THAT OFFERING MORE COURSES ONLINE IS A POSITIVE THING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT TO HELP THE STUDENTS SUCCEED YOU KNOW INTERNET ACCESS WHETHER IT'S COMPUTERS OR WHAT HAVE YOU BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE CERTAINLY SO BROUGHT SOME OF YOUR STUDENTS ARE. GOING TO SANTA MONICA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TRANSFERRING TO UCLA SOME ARE AT EAST LA COLLEGE GOING TO GO TO. TRADE SCHOOL SUMMER IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TRYING TO LEARN ENGLISH AND- FOCUS ON THEIR BASIC NEEDS AND SO. IT'S VERY VERY- DIFFERENT SO- AS WELL I MENTIONED WE WILL TRY TO FOCUS ON THE CALL ISSUE ON GOING- AND THEN KIND OF A THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR ALL SEGMENTS OF GOOD USE OF ONE TIME MONEY. WE MAY NOT HAVE A LOT OF ON GOING BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF ONE TIME- SUPPORT. TO OUR CSU SYSTEM. CAN WE BRING UP THAT- CHANCELLOR CASTRO. JUST A ONE WORD IN YOUR FACE WILL SHOW UP. STILL THERE ALSO CHAIRMAN CARD THERE YOU GO OKAY SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT TO WORKING WITH YOU- THIS YEAR. ON ON ON THE BUDGET CERTAINLY WHAT WOULD YOU SEE WHAT YOU WILL DO WHAT WE CAN TO FOCUS ON ON ON GOING TO RESTORE. THE CUTS FROM TWO YEARS AGO WE DO HAVE A LOT OF ONE TIME- MONEY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE TO PLAY WITH IN THE BUDGET SO WE'LL LOOK TO THE EXTENT FOR. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- BASIC NEEDS PROGRAMS A WE CAN SPEND THOSE MONIES OVER AT A NUMBER OF YEARS TO HAVE SOME CONTINUITY. I WILL SAY ONE THING TO WHICH MR TANG MENTIONED THAT WE ARE ALWAYS INTERESTED IN ACCESS AND THAT'S INSURING THAT ALL QUALIFIED STUDENTS TO APPLY. CAN GET IN TO SEE ISSUE THE POLICY THAT WE PUT IN A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT YOU KNOW FRANKLY THAT LEADERSHIP OF. ABOUT FELTING HERE WEEK WITH IT'S A REALITY NOW WE HAVE THE AUTOMATIC- SO WHAT'S IT CALLED. REDIRECTION THE AUTOMATIC REDIRECTION YOU CAN MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN GO TO ACS YOU AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING. BUT AS BUT STILL WE NEED MORE SPACE IN THE CSU ONE THING THAT I'M WORKING WITH YOU ON. IS FOR YOUR GRADUATION PROGRAM- SO S. SON CAMPUS ARE DOING CSU AS A WHOLE WE'RE DOING WELL SOME ARE DOING BETTER HERE AT SAC STATE WE NOW. AND YOU AT FRESNO YOU DID IT AT MY JOB THERE TOO BUT THERE'S THINGS THAT WE CAN DO BETTER AND THAT AND THAT HELPS. LOW INCOME STUDENTS MINORITY STUDENTS AND NOT ONLY IS IT THE GRADUATE FOUR YEARS. THAT'S LESS STUDENT DEBT FOR THEM LET. LAWS YOU KNOW GO TO WORK FOR SOONER. AND MORE SEATS FOR THEIR LITTLE BROTHER OR NEIGHBOUR WHOEVER ELSE TO GET INTO THAT CSU CAMPUS AND SO. THAT IS A BIG BIG PRIORITY AND SO WE HAVE SOME FINANCIAL AID IDEAS REFORM AND COUNTING ON YOUR HELP TO MAKE THOSE A REALITY- FOR UC- PRESIDENT DRAKE YOU STILL THERE WELL. YES YES JUST SAY QUOTE. YES SO WE- OKAY. JUST A COUPLE IN YOUR BACK. YES YOUR AM A NICE TO SEE YOU OKAY THERE YOU GO SO WE WON'T RE LITIGATE THE OUT OF STATE STUDENT THING BECAUSE- IT'S A NINE IT'S A NON WINNER FOR YOU ONE FOR POLITICS THE LEGISLATURE HUNTER PERCENT DOES NOT AGREE WITH YOU. ALL OF US GET A COMMENTS IN OUR DISTRICTS ABOUT PEOPLE WITH A FOUR POINT THREE WHO CAN'T GET INTO THEIR UC CAMPUS BUT THEY SEE STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERNATIONAL OR WEALTHY OUT OF STATERS TAKING THOSE SEATS. AND MISTER LEE JUST LEFT BUT I WILL NOTE THAT THAT DIDN'T AND MOST IMPORTANTLY MATH IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE BECAUSE THAT NUMBER CHAU HAS SOMEONE EVER TEAM NOTED. THAT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WHEN WE GAVE YOU SEE MORE MONEY WE SAW FEWER CALIFORNIA'S FOR EXAMPLE A UC DAVIS I WAS ASKING MISTER LEE WHEN HE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL HE SAID TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SO WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THINKING ABOUT UC DAVIS LET'S SAY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE. TO THE YEAR THAT HE GRADUATED TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL AN OUT OF STATE STUDENTS AT UC DAVIS DOUBLED FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS FROM CALIFORNIA WENT DOWN. SO THINK ABOUT THAT FEWER CALIFORNIANS DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS ALL IN THAT PERIOD WHEN WE WERE GIVING SIX NICK SIGNIFICANT INCREASES. TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FROM THE GENERAL FUND GRANTED I THINK YOU PUT THIS ISSUE TO BED FOR A BIT THE SENATE AS YOU NOW WANTS TO PUT THAT NUMBER DOWN I KNOW MR TANG TALKED ABOUT BRING IT DOWN BUT- BY DOING THAT WE HAVE TO PUT ANOTHER POT OF MONEY ON GOING. TO SUPPLANT THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD IN A PERFECT WORLD BUT I THINK THAT THE URGE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THIS IS IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN- WE WOULD LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES THAT AREN'T THERE LIKE. MERCED IN RIVERSIDE. NOW THERE'S NOT TO COME CLOSE TO THAT EIGHTEEN FIRST. REALIZE YOU CAN'T THE GENIE IN THE BOTTLE WITH THE OTHER ONES ABOVE- BUT CERTAINLY THAT IS THE ISSUE THAT IS VERY VERY CONCERNING TO US BECAUSE- WE GOT OUR DISTRICTS THAT SO WE HEAR THE MOST IS ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS AND YOU SEE IS THE MARQUEE. PUBLIC RESEARCH INSTITUTION IN THE WORLD. AND WE HAVE NINE FABULOUS UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES AND SO WE WANT THEM ALL TO STAY DO WELL AND THRIVE BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. ACCESS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AND YOU SEE IT BY THE NUMBERS LAST WEEK ON STUDENTS APPLYING- THE DATA CAME OUT LAST WEEK ON. UCLA AND ALL THE CAMPUS IS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IS THROUGH THE ROOF AND SO THERE IS A GREAT NUMBER OF STUDENTS GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL. A THREE G. READY READY TO GO TO THE UC AND SO- IT HAVING PROPER ENROLLMENT TARGETS AYE AYE ONE THING I DO WANNA SAY THAT I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF AND JUST GIVE YOU SEE A PAT ON THE BACK IS. LOOKING AT WAYS TO EXPAND ACCESS OUTSIDE OF THE CAMPUS. AND ELECTED BERKELEY THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT. GOING TO MILLS COLLEGE OR MOFFETT FIELD ACROSS THE WAY HERE IN SACRAMENTO- UC DAVIS IS LOOKING SPENDING PROGRAMS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AT THE MED CENTER. SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO BE CREATIVE. TO GET MORE STUDENTS IN THE UC IS I THINK A PRIORITY. PLUS I- THE FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES HE'S NOT WHILE NOT PERFECT IT THERE PRETTY SOLID YOU SEE. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATS AND YOU KNOW I'M SURE THIS IS TROUBLING TO YOU. THE STUDENTS AREN'T GRADUAL FOR YEARS AND GRADUATE MORE DEBT. ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE- BROWN A BLACK KIDS FROM CALIFORNIA SO ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES IS CERTAINLY. A PRIORITY- AND THEN- YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S- NOT POPULAR BUT IN REALITY- CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A THREE LEGGED STOOL TO FIND YOU SEE IT'S GENERAL FUND. IT'S NON RESIDENT MONEY AND IT'S STUDENT FEE SO. IF IT'S A FINITE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND. AND WE HAVE A POLICY CAPPING THE NON RESIDENT. THAT STUDENT FEE REVENUE STAYING STAGNANT FOR EVER I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE I THINK HAVING. MODERATE AND PREDICTABLE INCREASES IN THE COHORT MODEL LIKE. I REGION PRESENT FORMER SPEAKER AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. AT THE BORDER REGIONS I THINK THAT DOES MAKE SENSE I KNOW THIS YEAR IS A PROMISED TO KEEP THEM- STABLE DURING THIS LIST LIST YOU HAVE COVER NINETEEN THE PANDEMIC.

GOOD EVENING CARE MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CRYSTAL AND I AM A STUDENT AT THE END THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE DECREASE AND YOU DON'T REGISTRATION AND THE CCP FROM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A STUDENT. STUDENTS FEEL THAT THE EDUCATION IS BEING UNDERMINED THROUGH THE CURRENT DAPTATION OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM TEST ONLY ONLINE COURSES DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND THAT'S LEARNING ENVIRONMENT STUDENTS ARE MORE UNMOTIVATED ASSEMBLY ARE JUST UNABLE TO FOCUS IN THE SAME WAY THEY WOULD IF THEY WERE ATTENDING CLASSES IN PERSON. WITH IMPACT BANKING CLASSES STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO FULLY IMMERSE THEMSELVES INTO THEIR EDUCATION. BUSINESS NOW WHEN STUDENTS ARE NOT ONLY ARE HAVING MORE DIFFICULTY- FOCUSING ON THEIR STUDIES BUT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEIR FINANCIAL HARDSHIP CAUSED BY THE INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC I THINK THAT IF WE CAN USE FINANCIAL AID READY RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS TO INCENTIVIZE AND ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE A HIGHER EDUCATION. MORE STUDENTS WILL RETURN TO THE CCT PROFOUND MANY OF THE STUDENTS IN THE C. 50% LIKE MYSELF ARE SELF SUPPORTING A MAJOR CONCERN I HAVE IS FOR HOUSING AT THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO OUR STATE'S CURRENT MINIMUM WAGE. I MYSELF MAKE ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE AT THE RATE OF EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND EVEN I AM UNABLE TO AFFORD A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT I. INDIA ON MY OWN. I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO LIVE IN A SHARED HOUSEHOLD AND THEY'LL ONLY LET PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK I HEAR THIS BECAUSE MANY STUDENTS ARE SELF SUPPORTING. ARE ONLY MAKING AS MUCH AS MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT DUE TO THEIR CURRENT LEVEL OF EDUCATION WHICH SEEMS THERE FUNDS AS- AN ADDITION TO IT BEING THERE- BASIC NEEDS. NOW ALTHOUGH I SUPPORT MYSELF FOR EVEN. AND I'M CLEAN AS AN- AND THE STATE OF. I STILL MEET. CERTAIN CRITERIA TO BEGIN AS IN THE PEN AND THE FIVE THAT APPLE. IN THE MAIL AND HAVE IT ARE OF THE IT. IS ACTIVE AND YOU COME UP. IT AS AN- IS THAT TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD AGE. ANOTHER OF I AM OF THE PATH THAT. THAT APPLICATION THE I WOULD LIKE TO OUT IS THAT. STUDENTS ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE FULL TIME IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID. NOW SOMEONE IS A FULL TIME STUDENT AT THE BARE MINIMUM OF TWELVE UNITS. ONE UNIT REPRESENTING AN HOUR OF CLASS TIME. AND ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TWO TO THREE HOURS OF STUDY TIME PER UNIT OUTSIDE OF ARE ALREADY EXPECTED CLASS TIME. AVERAGES YOU THIRTY SIX TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS DEDICATED TO SCHOOLWORK FOR A WEEK. THANKS ARE GOING TO SCHOOL FULL TIME AT A MINIMUM OF THIRTY SIX HOURS A WEEK. GETTING THE FOR RECOMMENDED EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP PER NIGHT. AND WORKING FOR CRYING OUT FORTY HOURS PER WEEK WE ARE ONLY LEFT WITH THIRTY SIX HOURS OR LESS A THREE TIME IN THE WEEK. IF FACT.
