WHO HAVE FILED FOR EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. SINCE THE RENT REALLY PROGRAM LAUNCHED ONE YEAR AGO CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION IN DELIVERING ASSISTANCE TO THOSE MOST IN NEED AND AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOUSING. THE STATE PROGRAM HAS DELIVERED OVER TWO POINT FOUR SIX BILLION IN DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO DATE HELPING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PAY OFF RENTAL DEBT. AND AVOID EVICTION ONE IN THREE PAYMENTS NATIONALLY HAVE BEEN MADE IN CALIFORNIA TO TENANTS AND LANDLORDS INDEED. BUT IT IS TAKING LONGER THAN EXPECTED FOR THE STATE TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS FOR COVERT NINETEEN EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE. THOUSANDS CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR RELIEF WHILE THEIR APPLICATIONS PENNED. IT WOULD BE CRUEL IT WOULD BE WASTEFUL AND UNFAIR TO SUBJECT CALIFORNIANS TO EVICTION FOR THE LOSS OF RENTAL INCOME NOW. WHEN THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED AND ALSO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR RENT EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE IS EMINENT. AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE WILL EXTEND EVICTION PROTECTIONS THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE FILED A COMPLETE APPLICATION BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVING ON THE BRINK RIGHT NOW WHO ARE IN THE QUEUE TO RECEIVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE. AND IF WE DO NOT PASS THIS BILL TODAY THAT THOSE PROMISES WILL NOT BE HONORED SO WE NEED TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND PERFECT AS IT MAY BE. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW THE DEADLINE IS FAST APPROACHING WE CAME UP WITH A DEAL THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD THROUGH BOTH BODIES AND HOPEFULLY SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO. AND HOUSING COMMITTEE AND OTHER POLICY COMMITTEES AROUND PROTECTING OUR RENTERS ENSURING WEIGHT WHEN WE HAVE OUR HOUSING SUPPLY ENSURING WE HAVE LOW INCOME HOUSING.

SPORTS AND POLITICS AND OUR KIDS HE BECAME A MENTOR AND A FRIEND AND HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ENCOURAGING ME TO SEEK OFFICE. SO MY MOST CHERISHED MEMORIES. FROM MY TIME HERE THE VOICE MAILS AND TEXT LARRY WOULD SEND ME AFTER BILL PRESENTATION- FORSPEECH. BEING COMPLEMENTED BY LARRY ON PERSUASIVE SPEAKING WAS LIKE GETTING A COMPLIMENT FROM A MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER ON YOUR SWING. WHAT IS SURVIVED BY HIS WIFE CINDY'S TWO SONS. GRANDDAUGHTER FIVES FIVE SIBLINGS. WE'RE JOINED HERE BY SOME OF THEM TODAY. MEMBERS PLEASE JOIN ME IN ADJOURNING THE MEMORY OF LARRY MORSE. THANK YOU MR CUNNINGHAM AND MR GRAY YOUR TO ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS GERMAN IN MEMORY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE TWENTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THREE JR THE MEMORY. OF THE CONSTITUENT. A MENTOR AND A CLOSE FRIEND. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO I KNOW HE HAD A UNIQUE AND WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH LARRY. LET ME SHED A LITTLE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE. ON TO HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN HIS LIFE. LARRY LED AN ESTEEMED CAREER AS A CALLOUS TOP PROSECUTOR. IMPORTANTLY HE INITIATED THE COUNTY'S VIOLENCE INTERRUPTION OF PREVENTION EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM. PROGRAM ON WHICH HE AND I COLLABORATED CLOSELY SUCCESSFULLY BRING A PILOT PROJECT. AND FUNDING INTO THE STATE BUDGET. AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD PERSONALLY TRIED MORE CASES WHILE SERVING AS THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAN ANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HE WAS INCREDIBLY HARD WORKING HE ALSO FOUNDED THE COUNTY'S FIRST CRIME STOPPERS PROGRAM AND BROUGHT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. BY RELOCATING THE CURRENT DOWN NOT TO RELOCATING TO THE CURRENT DOWNTOWN LOCATION AND IMPLEMENTING CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY TO TURN THE OFFICE PAPERLESS. FOLLOWING HIS SERVICES A PUBLIC OFFICIAL LETTER WENT ON TO BE A HIGHLY CAPABLE AND EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE WORKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION COLLABORATING WITH LAWMAKERS. AND STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LEARN MORE SPECIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL COMPLIMENTS ARE TO NUMEROUS TO COVER TODAY BUT HIS PRIDE AND JOY WAS REALLY HIS FAMILY. TWO THREE BOYS DYLAN ETHAN AND RYAN HE WAS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE THEY AND HIS WIFE CINDY WHO'S JOINED US HERE TODAY LOVED AND RIVARD REVERED HIM. WHERE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CINDY WAS THE BEDROCK OF STRENGTH FOR THEIR FAMILY DURING THE INCALCULABLE LOSS OF THEIR SON ETHAN. AND OTHER TRAGIC. LIFE EVENTS. LARRY WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR MANY THINGS LIKE HIS DEEP AND ABIDING COMPASSION FOR OTHERS INCLUDING THOSE HE WAS TASKED WITH PROSECUTORS. IT'S LARGER THAN LIFE PERSONALITY BOOMING LAUGH HIS LOVE OF BOB DYLAN HIS TENDENCY TO IMPULSE PURCHASE GIFTS FOR FRIENDS AND- REYES OFTEN UNSOLICITED ADVICE ON LIFE LOVE CAREER AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LANDSCAPING. LETTERS LOS IS FELT DEEPLY EACH AND EVERY DAY IN MERCED COUNTY AND BEYOND. BUT IS VALUES AN EXAMPLE CONTINUE TO LIVE ON IN THE COUNTLESS PEOPLE HE BEFRIENDED MENTORED AND INFLUENCE INCLUDING ME. I CAN TRULY SAY I WOULDN'T BE HERE IN THE POSITION I AM TODAY I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE. MY COMMUNITY AND THIS GREAT STATE WITHOUT LARRY'S MENTORSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP.
