AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.165
ALLOWED MANY CALIFORNIANS TO

STAY ON THE PARENTS HEALTH

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:10.977
PLAN. AND SLOW THE RATE OF

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:11.945
GROWTH OF HEALTH INSURANCE

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.413
PREMIUMS PARTICULARLY IN THE

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.851
INDIVIDUAL MARKET. I THINK

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:18.552
IT'S- APPROPRIATE TO SAY A BIT

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:20.220
ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:22.589
THE ACA SINCE IT'S BEEN OVER

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:23.290
TEN YEARS SINCE WE IMPLEMENTED

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:26.960
IT. BACK THEN WE HAD INSURANCE

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:28.428
PREMIUMS PARTICULARLY FOR

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.764
INDIVIDUALS SKYROCKETING. AS

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.299
MANY INDIVIDUALS THAT PIECE OF

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.900
THE CONDITIONS EITHER COULD NOT

PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE OR

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:38.705
ONLY AT EXORBITANT RATES. WE

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:40.106
SAW PEOPLE WHO HAD PAID FOR

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.375
INSURANCE FOR YEARS AND THEN

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.110
WHEN THEY FINALLY FELL ILL.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.612
WE'RE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.747
INSURANCE YOU ALSO HAD PEOPLE

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:50.717
WHO HAD CONDITIONS IN WHICH-

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:51.818
BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OF THE

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:53.620
TREATMENT. INSURANCE BECAUSE A

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.989
LIFETIME COVERAGE ESSENTIALLY

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:56.690
ENDED WHILE THEY WERE IN THE

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.124
MIDDLE THEIR TREATMENT. AND YOU

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.193
HAD FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.062
WERE GOING OFF TO COLLEGE AND

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.663
YET BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT IN

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.633
THE WORK FORCE. WE'RE UNABLE TO

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.337
HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. BECAUSE

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:11.037
THEY CANNOT STAY ON THEIR

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:11.738
PARENTS PLAN. SO THIS AND MANY

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:14.174
OTHER REASONS WERE WHAT DROVE

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:18.178
THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA. NOW AS

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:19.613
AFTER THE DEBATE THE PASSAGE OF

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:22.382
THE ACA. I THINK MANY PEOPLE

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.818
OVER TIME RECOGNIZE HOW

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:25.685
IMPORTANT IT IS IN FACT IN MANY

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:28.221
STATES. WHO DIDN'T INITIALLY

00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:30.457
ADOPTED THE MEDICAID EXPANSIONS

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:34.427
IN THE ACA. EVEN DESPITE THE

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.095
RESISTANCE FROM THE

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:35.795
LEGISLATURE'S HE PEOPLE HAVE

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:37.197
ACTUALLY PASSED INITIATIVES IN

00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:39.266
THOSE STATES TO IMPLEMENT.

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:40.934
EXPANSIONS OF THE MEDICAID

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:42.002
PROGRAM AND OTHER TYPES OF

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.170
CHANGES AS WELL. HOWEVER MORE

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.506

STRAINS OF THE ACA- AS YOU SAID

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:59.139

INDIVIDUAL SMALL GROUP AND

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:19.125
LARGE GROUP ALSO AFFORDABILITY

00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:21.428
ACCESSIBILITY TRANSPARENCY EASE

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.063
OF USE FOR CONSUMERS.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.531
PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:26.366
PROMOTING PREVENTION WELLNESS

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:28.201
AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SO IT'S

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:31.204
SO MUCH THAT IS AT STAKE. THE

00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:35.575
FEDERAL ACA. STRUCTURE INCLUDES

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:37.444
THE COVERAGE- ISSUES THAT WE

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.745
TALKED ABOUT THE CONSUMER

00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:41.781
INSURANCE PROTECTIONS AND ALSO

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:43.349
HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.218
QUALITY AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:47.253
AND IT MADE VERY SUBSTANTIAL

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.089
CHANGES TO MEDICARE INCLUDING

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:51.891
PAYMENT REFORMS AND CLOSING.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.060
THE GAP IN THE MEDICARE PART D.

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:56.362
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM ALL

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.797
THESE AT POTENTIAL RISK THE

00:09:57.864 --> 00:10:00.400
COVERAGE FRAMEWORK ITSELF IS-

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:01.401
REVOLVES AROUND MEDICAID

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:03.603
EXPANSION AS YOU SAID MEDIC CAL

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.572
IN CALIFORNIA MARKET REFORMS

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:08.208
EXCHANGES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.410
AND INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES

00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:12.579
BOTH FOR INDIVIDUALS AND

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.948
EMPLOYERS THIS CHART REALLY

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:17.484
SHOWS THE EXTENT OF THE PROOF

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.052
THE INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.653
AND ALSO SHOWS THAT IT DOES

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.623
APPLY- TO ALL MARKETS NOT MANY

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.292
OF THEM DO APPLY- NOTABLY

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:27.293
COVERAGE FOR PREVENTIVE

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.895
SERVICES WITH NO COST SHARING

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.698
AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER THOUGH

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:33.399
THE ANNUAL AND LIFETIME LIMITS.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.168
BEING PROHIBITED AND SO BEFORE

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:37.270
THE ACA WE HAD IT ON AND RATE

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:39.539
OF UNINSURED AROUND 20% FOR

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:42.408
DECADES- I THINK WE HAD A

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.477
MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT ONLY

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:46.346
SERVES CERTAIN POPULATIONS AND

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.181
WAS PARTICULARLY COMPLEX IN

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:49.983
TERMS OF ENROLLMENT. WE HAVE

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:51.117
THIS VERY DYSFUNCTIONAL

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:52.752
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:53.720
MARKET THAT WAS YOU

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:55.488
EUPHEMISTICALLY DUBBED THE WILD

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:57.757
WILD WEST WITH VERY FEW ROLES

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.359
AND MINIMAL STATE OVERSIGHT.

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:01.060
CALIFORNIANS COULD EXPERIENCE

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:03.096
DISCRIMINATION JOB LUCK JOB

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.864
LOCK AND DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:06.199
HEALTH CARE IF THEY CHANGE JOBS

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:08.001
OR EXPERIENCE OTHER LIFE

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.703
CHANGES CALIFORNIA WENT ALL IN

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.971
AND WE NOT ONLY EMBRACED ALL

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:14.474
ASPECTS OF THE ACA BUT WE ALSO

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:16.276
PRESERVED AND BUILT ON OUR OWN

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.511
TREATS- PREVIOUS CONSUMER

00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:23.616
PROTECTIONS. AND EXPANDED

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.718
COVERAGE. WE HAD THEM CAL. WITH

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:28.488
THE WENT ON TO. ON THAT WITH M.

00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:29.756
STATE FUNDED COMPREHENSIVE

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.424
MEDICARE UP TO LOW INCOME

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:32.425
UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:34.894
SENIORS WE'LL HEAR ABOUT COVER

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:37.864
CALIFORNIA FROM MR LEE- WE ALSO

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:40.099
INVESTED HEAVILY AND WROTE OUT

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.834
REGION WRONG THEN AND MAKING IT

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:42.869
POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO GET

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:45.205
SIGNED UP. AND THEN WE WENT

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.207
BEYOND THE ACA WITH THINGS LIKE

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:48.942
STANDARDIZED BENEFITS THAT HELP

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:51.511
INDIVIDUALS. SEARCH AFFECTIVELY

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:54.781
AND COMPARED THEIR- POTENTIAL

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:56.382
COVERAGE OFTEN OPTIONS. THIS IS

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:58.718
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT A PRE

00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:00.853
ACA INDIVIDUAL MARKET I THINK

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.224
OF IT AS- THE POTENTIAL FOR.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.625
CALIFORNIANS TO GET STYMIED

00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:07.493
ALONG THE WAY EITHER AS THEY

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.395
WERE APPLYING FOR COVERAGE AND

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:11.064
BEING DENIED BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.532
HEALTH STATUS AND THIS IS

00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:13.800
IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WE THINK OF

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:16.636
CANCER DIABETES HEART DISEASE-

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:18.805
BUT PREGNANCY WAS A PRE

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.873
EXISTING CONDITION AND ALSO-

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.575
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD PAST

00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:23.977
ILLNESSES EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:25.912
RESOLVED THAT COULD BE A CAUSE

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:27.280
FOR THEM GETTING TONIGHT AND OF

00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:29.282
COURSE WE THINK. AS WE ARE

00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:30.717
LOOKING AT IT THAT CO THAT

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.685
EVENTUALLY WILL BE A HIGH A PRE

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.887
EXISTING CONDITION- THEY CAN

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:37.357
ALSO BE STYMIED AS THEY SOUGHT

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.758
COVERAGE YOU MIGHT BE GET

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:39.993
COVERAGE BUT THEN THE RATES

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:42.829
COULD SKYROCKET. IF THEY HAD

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:45.064
ANY KIND OF- HEALTH ISSUE AND

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.866
THEN ONCE THEY SECURED COVERAGE

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.102
THE BENEFITS MIGHT BE LIMITED

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.603
FOR EXAMPLE EXCLUDING MENTAL

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.171
HEALTH OR ADDICTION TREATMENT

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:53.873
OR EXCLUDING THOSE VERY

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.341
SPECIFIC THING THEY NEEDED

00:12:55.408 --> 00:12:57.343
BECAUSE- IT WAS A REFLECTION OF

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.411
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:00.647
EARLIER. SO SALUTING THEIR FOOT

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:04.050
ANYTHING. TO DO WITH THEIR FOOT

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.785
AS AN EXAMPLE THE POSTINGS END

00:13:05.852 --> 00:13:07.720
OF THE MARKET ADDRESSED ALL

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.489
THREE OF THESE AREAS. THE

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:10.356
REQUIRING EVERYONE TO GET

00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:13.293
COVERAGE- ELIMINATING THE

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:15.261
ABILITY OF HEALTH PLANS TO RATE

00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:17.163
UP BASED ON HEALTH STATUS AND

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.298
ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:19.732
COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.435
INCLUDING ELIMINATING THE

00:13:22.502 --> 00:13:23.136
ANNUAL AND LIFETIME DOLLAR

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:25.571
LIMITS. SO AGAIN THIS IS JUST

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.206
ME SAYING AND IT'S SORT OF

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:29.375
BECOME KIND OF A ONE LINER

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:31.210
COVER PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:32.679
CONDITIONS BUT IT'S NOT A ONE

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:33.880
LINER IS A COMPREHENSIVE

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.748
PROGRAM THAT STARTS WHEN YOU

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.317
APPLY AND GOES ALL THE WAY

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:39.352
UNTIL YOU RECEIVE BENEFITS.

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:40.720
HEALTH STATUS IS NO LONGER A

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:43.022
FACTOR. SO AS YOU MENTIONED

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:44.924
CENTER WE SUCCESSFULLY DROPPED

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.294
OUR UNINSURED RATE IN HALF. AND

00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:50.630
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT.

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:55.201
THE OVERALL RESULT IS THAT THE

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:57.036
ACA MORE CALIFORNIANS CAN STAY

00:13:57.103 --> 00:13:58.738
COVERED WHEN THEY CHANGE JOBS

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:00.239
HAVE A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:02.141
OR OTHERWISE LOSE COVERAGE AND

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:04.210
MANY. CAN GET FINANCIAL HELP IF

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:07.180
THEY QUALIFY JUST A NOTE- ON

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.382
THE STE THE IMPACTS ON EQUITY

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:12.185
THAT- WE CAN SEE FROM THE ACA

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.520
SO ALL. RACIAL AND ETHNIC

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.656
GROUPS- FOUND IMPROVED HEALTH

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:18.291
INSURANCE RATES WITH THE LATINO

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.926
IS EXPERIENCING THE LARGEST

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:22.261
REDUCTION AND LOW INCOME

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:24.330
CALIFORNIANS AS WELL AS THE

00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:25.832
SENATE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:28.534
REGION SAW SIGNIFICANT DECLINES

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:30.036
THAT WE HAVE TO MENTION MUST

00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:31.337
MENTION THAT DESPITE THESE

00:14:31.404 --> 00:14:33.005
IMPROVEMENTS. THERE ARE STILL

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.440
SOME VERY SERIOUS HEALTH

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:36.976
DISPARITIES IN THE RATE OF AN

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.846
INSURANCE. AMONG NON WHITE POP.

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:41.848
COMPARED TO WHITE POPULATIONS

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:43.483
SO ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT'S

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.252
AT STAKE IS WHAT WE CAN SEE IS

00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:48.521
THAT THE ACA MADE VERY DRAMATIC

00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:50.790
CHANGES IN VIRTUALLY ALL AREAS

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:52.525
OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COVERAGE.

00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:53.960
THE UC BERKELEY LABORCENTER

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:55.995
ESTIMATES THAT CALIFORNIA COULD

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.865
END ONLY ANNUALLY LOSE TWENTY

00:14:58.931 --> 00:14:59.532
SEVEN BILLION AND THEY JUST

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:02.602
CAME OUT WITH. INTENSELY TWO

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:03.269
HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:04.971
JOBS IF THE ACA WAS REPEALED

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:07.206
ARE STRUCK DOWN. AND SO REALLY

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:09.442
SIGNIFICANTLY CALIFORNIA STANDS

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:11.944
TO LOSE MATCH OF THE HISTORIC

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.646
GAINS IT MADE IN THINKING ABOUT

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:15.248
IT YOU KNOW REALLY IN LESS THAN

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:16.382
A DECADE REALLY QUITE

00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:18.584
ASTONISHING GIVING OUR HISTORY

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:20.887
PRIOR TO THE ACA. IMPROVING

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.889
ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:24.924
QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE. AND WITH

00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:28.428
THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:29.128
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.863
FOR ME. OKAY THANK YOU I THINK

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.864
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL THEN

LONGER CONSTITUTIONAL AND AS A

00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:33.493

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:34.894
PROVISIONS OF THE LAW ARE TIED

00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:36.329
TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. THAT

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:37.196
ALL THE OTHER PROVISIONS

CONDITIONS MUST FALL- THE

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:44.737
ARGUMENT RELIES- SOLELY ON THE

00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:46.239
SUPREME COURT'S TWENTY TWELVE

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:46.939
DECISION IN THE NATIONAL

00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:57.750
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHICH

00:16:57.817 --> 00:16:59.118
REQUIRED PEOPLE TO BUY HEALTH

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:00.119

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.622
THE IRS. BEFORE REACHING THAT

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:03.956
CONCLUSION THE COURT REASONED

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.525
THAT IF THE MANDATE WERE READ

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.627
AS A COMMANDS. IT WOULD BE

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.795
UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT THE COURT

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:10.730
FOR THE REASON THAT THE

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:13.799
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE COULD BE

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.500
INTERPRETED AS A TAX. THAT IS

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:16.068
NEARLY TAX OF THOSE WHO CHOOSE

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:17.270
NOT TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.471
COVERAGE AND IT WAS

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:21.374
CONSTITUTIONAL. IN TWENTY

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.041
SEVENTEEN WHEN CONGRESS REDUCE

00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:23.342
THE AMOUNT OF THAT TAX ZERO

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.244
DOLLARS BUT LACKS THE ACTUAL

00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:26.546
TAX AND LANGUAGE OF THE

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:28.814

00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:34.053
HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE ON

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.187
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:37.223
REPUBLICAN LED STATES EMBRACE

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.692
THIS IDEA THAT. THE AC WAS

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:41.594
INVALID- AN ACTION THAT WAS SO

00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:43.062

IN THIS CASE IN ORDER TO ENSURE

00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:54.707
THAT THERE WAS A PARTY

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:56.275
DEFENDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:58.945

THE DISTRICT COURT ACCEPTED THE

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.085
PLAINTIFFS ARGUMENTS. AND THE

00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:07.920
COURT OF APPEAL ACCEPTED THE

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:09.021
ARGUMENT THAT THE MANDATE IS

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.957
NOW UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT DID

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:12.525
NOT DECIDE AS TO WHETHER THE

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.260
REST OF THE ACA SHOULD FALL IN

00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:16.495
WAS INVALID. OUR COALITION

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.097
ASKED THE SUPREME COURT TO HEAR

00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:21.267
THE CASE IN JANUARY. AND THE

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:22.835

THE CASE ON OUR BEHALF.

00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:30.710
CALIFORNIA HAS PRESENTED THREE

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:31.911
ARGUMENTS WHY I BELIEVE WE

00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:34.013
SHOULD WHEN THIS CASE FIRST WE

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.414
ARGUE THAT NO PLAINTIFF IN THIS

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:37.049
CASE HAS STANDING TO FILE THIS

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.518
LAWSUIT. STANDING AS MANY OF

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:41.120
YOU KNOW IS THE BASIC IDEA THAT

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:42.989
A PERSON CAN CHALLENGE A LOT IN

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.490
COURTS. AND MUST SHOW THAT THE

00:18:44.557 --> 00:18:46.659
LAW CAUSES HIM OR HER SOME

00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:48.427
INJURY. HERE THAT YOU

INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS HAVE NO.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.598

PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING HEALTH

00:18:53.933 --> 00:18:56.102

DOLLARS NO HARM THERE'S NO

00:18:57.503 --> 00:18:59.672
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE. FURTHER

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.440
ON THE STATES THAT HAVE SUED.

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:04.143

HARMS BY ZERO DOLLAR INDIVIDUAL

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:08.948
MANDATE- SECOND WE ARGUE THAT

00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:11.384
WHAT IS LEFT OF THE INDIVIDUAL

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.818
MANDATE REMAINS CONSTANT

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:14.754
CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO DIAL

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.423
UP AND DIAL DOWN. ON TAXES AND

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.225
THEY DO THAT OFTEN AND SO IN

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.326
THE SAME WAY THAT THEY DIAL

00:19:20.393 --> 00:19:22.194
DOWN THE MEDICAL DEVICE TAX AT

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:23.863
ONE POINT. THEY HAVE THE

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:24.697
AUTHORITY TO DIAL DOWN THE

00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:27.700
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY TAX-

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:29.135
AND THAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL NOT

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:31.070
AS WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW- AND

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:33.072
LAST EVEN IF THE COURT DECIDES

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:34.240
NOW THAT THE TOOTHLESS

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.308
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ZERO DOLLAR

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:39.211
PENALTY IS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:39.979
BUT IT SEVERABLE FROM THE REST

00:19:40.046 --> 00:19:42.014
OF THE ECA. THIS LEGAL DOCTRINE

00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:43.416
ASKED WHETHER IF ONE

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:44.450
PROVISIONAL LAW IS

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.685
UNCONSTITUTIONAL OTHER

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:47.086
PROVISIONS OF THE LAW MUST ALSO

00:19:47.153 --> 00:19:49.689
BE HELD BALLOT. THIS BOILS DOWN

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:50.389
TO A QUESTION OF CONGRESSIONAL

00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:52.958
INTENT. WHETHER IF CONGRESS HAD

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:54.126
KNOWN THAT ONE PROVISION OF THE

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.795
LOT IT DOC DID WAS

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.263
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IT WOULD HAVE

00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:58.297
PREFERRED TO KEEP THE REST OF

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:00.766
THE LAW OR SCRAP IT ENTIRELY.

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.301
HERE WE ARGUE THAT THE INTENT

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:04.837
OF THE CONGRESS- IN TWENTY

00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:06.939
SEVENTEEN WAS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR.

00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:07.940
BY GETTING RID OF THE ONLY

00:20:08.007 --> 00:20:09.475
NEGATIVE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.976
HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.478
CONGRESS VERY INTENSELY KNEW

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.113
WHAT IT WAS DOING AND LEFT THE

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.082
REST OF THE LAW ON THE BOOKS-

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:17.116
AND THERE ARE MANY STATEMENTS

00:20:17.183 --> 00:20:18.617
BY MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:21.387
SENATE- WHERE IT'S VERY CLEAR

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:23.055
THIS ISN'T. EXPANSION THIS

00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:24.056
ISN'T THE PRE EXISTING

00:20:24.123 --> 00:20:24.890
CONDITION PROTECTIONS

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:26.792
ASSISTANCE- SUBSIDIES ECCENTRIC

00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:29.128
SATCHER- AT THE SAME TIME

00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:30.763
CONGRESS PRESERVED EVERY OTHER

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.565
FEATURE OF THE ACA CAPTAIN IN

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:35.367
TAX- AND- WE ARGUE THAT

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:36.869
CONGRESS IS INTACT ACTIONS IN

00:20:36.936 --> 00:20:38.304
THIS CASE ARE CONCLUSIVE PROOF.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.605
THAT IF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:40.272
IN ITS PRESENT FORM IS

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:41.807
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. CONGRESS

00:20:41.874 --> 00:20:43.509
WANTED THE REST OF THE ACA TO

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.311
REMAIN IN PLACE. AND THISCASE

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:50.116
IS LEGALLY. DANGEROUS AND IT'S

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:50.783
IRRESPONSIBLE TAKING WITH

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:51.484

MORE DURING A PANDEMIC EVER

PURCHASED NOW IS WRONG- WE'VE

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.298
SEEN THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:07.733

THAT I'M A MEMBER TENANTS-

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:18.731
ACA IN REMOVING LIFETIME CAPS.

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:21.166
ON INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.636
OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE INSURANCE

00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:38.384
IMPORTANCE OF HOW THE ACA HAS

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.953
REMOVED A LIFETIME CAPS IN WHAT

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.122
WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE NOT

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:44.690
JUST FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:47.893
BUT IN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE IF

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.497
THE LIFETIME CAP REMOVAL WERE

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:56.068
TO BE REVERSED. THANK YOU. OKAY

00:23:56.135 --> 00:23:57.403
THE CENTER I'M BE HAPPY TO TAKE

00:23:57.469 --> 00:23:59.705
A STAB AND MAYBE MELANIE ALSO

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:02.241
HONORED. YOU RAISE A REALLY

00:24:02.308 --> 00:24:05.611
IMPORTANT- QUESTION- AND I

00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:07.880
THINK GENERALLY I WAS TRYING

00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:10.015
AND- TO REINFORCE WHAT YOU'RE

00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:12.384
SAYING THAT YOU SEE IS THAT ONE

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.886
PROVISIONS AROUND PRE EXISTING

00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:15.554
CONDITION IS A COMPREHENSIVE

00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:16.555
FRAMEWORKS THAT MAKE SURE

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.857
PEOPLE WHO. EITHER HAVE HEALTH

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:20.559
ISSUES OR NEED HEALTH SERVICES

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:22.194
ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST

00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:23.896
RIGHT SO THE ANNUAL AND

00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:26.031
LIFETIME LIMITS ESSENTIALLY

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:29.368
SAID. YOU ARE COVERED. BUT YOU

00:24:29.435 --> 00:24:33.605
MAY ONLY USE- THIS MANY DOLLARS

00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:35.908
WORTH OF SERVICES IN A YEAR.

00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:38.744
AND MOREOVER IT COULD BE A

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:39.812
LIMIT OF A COUPLE HUNDRED

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:40.646
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FOR PEOPLE

00:24:40.713 --> 00:24:41.780
WITH THE MOST SERIOUS

00:24:41.847 --> 00:24:44.683
CONDITIONS WHETHER IT'S CANCER.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.554
OR WELL CANCERS THE BIG WHEN I

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.356
SUPPOSE BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:52.124
CONDITIONS ARE YOU CAN EVEN

00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:54.793
HAVE A MAJOR ACCIDENT- AND HAVE

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.962
THESE HIGH MEDICAL BILLS LONG

00:24:57.029 --> 00:25:00.699
TERM NEED FOR ONGOING CARE. AND

00:25:00.766 --> 00:25:03.002
SO AS I WAS SAYING I THINK AT

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:04.870
EVERY TURN IN THE PRE ACA

00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:06.605
MARKET INDIVIDUALS COULD

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:08.874
EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION BASED

00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:10.342
ON WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THEM

00:25:10.409 --> 00:25:12.144
WHAT SERVICES THEY NEED OR

00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:13.946
WHERE THEY'VE BEEN AND SO I

00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:15.147
THINK IT IT'S DEFINITELY A

00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:18.784
MAJOR ISSUE. AND AS I SAID IT'S

00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:19.985
NOT JUST AN ISSUE FOR PEOPLE

00:25:20.052 --> 00:25:21.754
BUYING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE IT

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.290
IS LAYS ACROSS THE BOARD IN

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:25.958
TERMS OF EMPLOYER BASED

00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:28.560
COVERAGE. AND SO A LOT MORE

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.162
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED

00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:33.499
BY THINGS LIKE THE PROHIBITION

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:35.968
ON PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND

00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:40.205
THE ANNUAL AND LIFETIME LIMITS-

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.374
THEN MIGHT HAVE BEFORE- I HOPE

00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:44.777
THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. YES

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:46.779
THANK YOU THAT IS HELPFUL IN

00:25:46.845 --> 00:25:49.515
MAY BE ON THE LEGAL FRONT FROM

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:50.716
MISS RAINER WOULD HAVE A

00:25:50.783 --> 00:25:53.218
COMMENT ON THE SEVERABILITY

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:59.258
ISSUE. THE SUPREME COURT COULD.

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:00.793
THE HELP WALK US THROUGH THIS

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:03.929
THAT COULD INVALIDATE SOME.

00:26:03.996 --> 00:26:05.631
MANDATE WHICH THEY ALREADY DID

00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:08.734
THE PENALTY MANDATE BUT RULED

00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:12.337
THAT THE REST OF IT. IT

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:13.906
MAINTAINS AND IN THESE FOR.

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:17.409
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE STILL PART

00:26:17.476 --> 00:26:20.379
OF EXISTING LAW. YEAH I MEAN I

00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:21.880
THINK THAT SENATOR TO YOUR

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:23.615
QUESTION AND VERY INSIGHTFUL

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:26.018
POINT- THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER

00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:27.019
OF THINGS THE SUPREME COURT

00:26:27.086 --> 00:26:32.257
COULD DO HERE- AND YOU KNOW I.

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:32.891
DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON THAT

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:33.559
I DO THINK THEY ARE OF CAN

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:35.627
INSTEAD THROUGH ONE LIKE YOU

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:36.595
SAID THEY THEY COULD DECIDE

00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:38.597
THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS

00:26:38.664 --> 00:26:39.298
UNCONSTITUTIONAL LEAVE IT AT

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:41.500
THAT- THEY COULD ALSO DECIDE

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:42.434
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS

00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:44.002
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THEN NOT

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:45.471
SEVERABLE FROM THE REST OF THE

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:46.271
LAW AND TAKE DOWN THE REST OF

00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:48.740
THE LOT- ONE OF THE THINGS

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:49.875
THEY'RE RELYING ON IN THE

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:51.577
SEVERABILITY ARGUMENT BASED ON

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.579
THE NFIB DECISION- ARE SOME

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:54.813
LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS THAT

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.381
ACCOMPANIED THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.350
ACT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. AND

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:01.086
THOSE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS-

00:27:01.153 --> 00:27:02.387
WE'RE DYING TO SHOW THE

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:03.155
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE

00:27:03.222 --> 00:27:04.990
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND SOME OF

00:27:05.057 --> 00:27:06.225
THE OTHER PROVISIONS INCLUDING

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.392
GUARANTEED ISSUE IN SOME OF THE

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:11.029
PRE EXISTING CONDITION

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:11.797
PROTECTIONS AND SO I DO THINK

00:27:11.864 --> 00:27:12.965
THERE ARE SOME WHO THINK IF

00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:14.600
DECIDE TO MANDATE AND- THEY

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:17.269
MAKE. TO SEVER OFF THOSE

00:27:17.336 --> 00:27:20.973
pBECAUSE THEY'RE TIED TOGETHER

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.941
AND USE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS-

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:24.843
THAT BEING SAID THERE WOULD

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.345
STILL BE A GREAT AMOUNT OF HARM

00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:28.147
AND IMPACTED TEAM STATES AND

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:29.481
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR A

00:27:29.548 --> 00:27:30.649
DECISION LIKE THAT AND SO IN NO

00:27:30.716 --> 00:27:31.950
WAY IS IT A MORE MODERATE

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:34.620
pYOU KNOW MANY MILLIONS OF

00:27:34.686 --> 00:27:35.988
PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED

00:27:36.054 --> 00:27:38.357
BY THAT AND WOULD BE- HARMS AND

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:41.059
SO- YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:42.861
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT-

00:27:42.928 --> 00:27:43.962
TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:45.164
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.865
SURVIVED AT THE SUPREME COURT.

00:27:46.932 --> 00:27:48.734
AND YOU KNOW WE THINK WE HAVE A

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.003
STRONG CASE ANYTHING WERE

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:51.670
BACKED BY A BUNCH OF

00:27:51.737 --> 00:27:53.539
BIPARTISAN- COALITION STATES

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:54.606
GROUPS AND SO WE'RE WE'RE

00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:59.745
HOPEFUL THAT. THE COURT WILL

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:00.445

PROVISION IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:32.304
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE REST

00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:34.606
OF THE LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL

00:29:34.673 --> 00:29:36.808
WELL THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.777
TO ME- AND WITHOUT MAKING THE

00:29:38.844 --> 00:29:40.279
OTHER SIDE'S CASE WHAT WOULD

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:42.547
THEY ARGUE- THAT WOULD

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:45.684
INVALIDATE THE- AFFORDABLE CARE

00:29:45.751 --> 00:29:48.854
ACT. YES SIR SIR AND THANK YOU

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.389
SON OF THE LATE GAS. FOR YOUR

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:52.190
SERVICE AND- BEING NAVIGATOR

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:53.625
THAT'S REALLY WONDERFUL AND-

00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:55.027
YEAH I THINK THE OTHER SIDE IS

00:29:55.093 --> 00:29:56.194
COMPLETELY RELYING ON A COUPLE

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.130
OF THINGS HERE- THAT THEY'VE

00:29:58.196 --> 00:30:00.132
YOU KNOW CONSISTENTLY HAVE. PUT

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:00.832
OUT IN THEIR PAPERS AND

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:06.538
FILIGS- BASED OFF OF THE NFIB

00:30:06.605 --> 00:30:09.474
DECISION- THAT THAT MANDY WAS

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:10.809
NO LONGER CONSTITUTIONAL AND SO

00:30:10.876 --> 00:30:11.943
EVERYTHING ELSE NOT SEPARABLE

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:12.911
AND WHAT THEY'RE USING AS A

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:14.446
JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT ARE

00:30:14.513 --> 00:30:16.114
THESE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:17.849
FROM THE ACA ITSELF THERE'S

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:19.751
ACTUALLY- A COUPLE OF FINDINGS

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.253
IN THE LAW AS IT WAS PASSED

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.354
THAT WERE DONE FOR COMMERCE

00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:23.322
CLAUSE AND OTHER SORT OF

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:25.090
CONSIDERATIONS. AND THOSE

00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:26.458
FINDINGS TIED TO GATHER

00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:28.694
EVERYTHING AND SO THAT THAT IS

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.628
THE BASIS OF THEIR ARGUMENT

00:30:29.695 --> 00:30:32.464
THAT- YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK TO

00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:34.399
WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL OR SUSAN

00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:35.667
COLLINS SAID ON THE UNITED

00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:37.135
STATES SENATE FLOOR TO FIGURE

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:39.104
OUT WHAT. DAIS TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:40.806
CONGRESS MEN YOU SHOULD LOOK TO

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:42.574
THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS FROM

00:30:42.641 --> 00:30:44.176
TWO THOUSAND AND TEN A CONGRESS

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:45.811
THAT HAD NO INSIGHT INTO OR

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:48.413
PURVIEW INTO WHAT THE TWENTY

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.981
SEVENTEEN CONGRESS WAS. DOING

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:50.916
AND YOU KNOW SEPARABILITY

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:52.918
DOCTRINE AS A AS A FLUID DOCTOR

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:54.619
OF LAW BUT I THINK YOU KNOW

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:56.221
GIVEN THE BODY OF STATEMENTS

00:30:56.288 --> 00:30:58.423
AND ALSO THE CASE FIVE. I THINK

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.559
WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT. THAT

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:01.660
SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE THAT A

00:31:01.727 --> 00:31:02.794
CONGRESS SEVEN YEARS AGO

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:03.595
SHOULDN'T BE IN THE CITING

00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:05.197
FACTOR FOR WHETHER OR NOT THE-

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:08.300
BACKBONE OF OUR HEALTH CARE

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:08.967

FIGHT WE APPRECIATE YOU. THANK

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I ALSO

00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:21.613
INFORMATION BUT UP FOR ME

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.748
PERSONALLY WHEN I HEAR THINGS

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:24.149
OUT LIKE THE PRE EXISTING

00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:26.385
CONDITIONS SUCH AS PREGNANCY

00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:28.053
AND NOW WE KNOW THE PUBLIC

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.888

00:31:29.955 --> 00:31:31.890
YOU KNOW CAN CONCERNED I JUST

00:31:31.957 --> 00:31:33.759
WANT TO ASK AND ANSWER TO PUT

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:34.526
IN A SITUATION WE DON'T HAVE

00:31:34.593 --> 00:31:36.728
THE ANSWER BUT- WE DO KNOW THAT

00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:38.130
AFTER NINE ELEVEN. IT TOOK

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:40.232
APPROXIMATELY TEN YEARS FIFTEEN

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:41.400
YEARS TO SEE THAT THE AFTER

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:42.834
EFFECTS OF WHAT THE FIRST

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:45.237
RESPONDERS HAD DEALT WITH

00:31:45.303 --> 00:31:46.805
ANYTHING AS THE TRAGEDY WAS

00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:48.573
UNFOLDING AND A LOT OF THEM

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.576
PERISHED YEARS LATER- ARE WE IS

00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:53.779

THAT WE HAVE AND IS IT USING

00:31:57.883 --> 00:31:59.084
BEING USED AS PART OF THE

00:31:59.151 --> 00:32:01.686
ARGUMENT. IN PARTICULAR I KNOW

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:03.121
PER A PERSONAL FRIEND WHO'S

DEALING WITH READING ISSUES AND

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:05.957
LONG ISSUES I MEAN IS THERE

00:32:06.024 --> 00:32:07.859
DATA THAT WE ARE USING ACTUAL

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:12.097
RESEARCH. TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT

00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:14.933
EVIDENCE. DESPITE SIR SENATOR

A TALK TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:20.405
THAT SUIT AND CENTER IN OUR IN

00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:21.873
OUR BIGGEST FREAKS WHICH WERE

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.041
HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU AND YOUR

00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:25.110
STAFF AND WE HAD MANY MANY

00:32:25.177 --> 00:32:26.011
GROUPS PUBLIC HEALTH

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:28.880
ASSOCIATIONS- ECONOMISTS TALK

00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:30.449
ABOUT SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:32.050
GETTING AT THAT SORT OF WE

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:32.751
DON'T KNOW THE LONG TERM

00:32:32.818 --> 00:32:34.886
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS- AND TALK

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:35.887
ABOUT SORT OF THE ECONOMIC

00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:37.355
IMPACT OF THAT AND HEALTH

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:38.023
IMPACTS SO WE'RE HAPPY TO SEND

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:39.591
THOSE OVER THE ONLY THING I

00:32:39.658 --> 00:32:41.660
WOULD FLAG IS MY MOM HAD CODED

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:43.161
THIS SUMMER SHE WAS IN THE

00:32:43.228 --> 00:32:44.029
HOSPITAL SHE WAS ON A BREATHING

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:45.797
MACHINE. SHE WAS VERY VERY

00:32:45.864 --> 00:32:47.699
SICK- AND LIKE YOU'RE SAYING

00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:49.701
YOUR FRIEND IT'S NOT JUST CODED

00:32:49.768 --> 00:32:51.369
SHE HAS JOINT PAIN NOW SHE HAS

00:32:51.436 --> 00:32:53.438
BEEN MUSEUM ISSUES SHE GETS

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:55.240
VERY TIRED SHE HAS FOGGY BRAIN

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:56.908
AND SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN

00:32:56.975 --> 00:32:57.776
THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE

00:32:57.843 --> 00:32:59.945
TRUE IMPACT OF THAT WOULD SO

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:01.179
YOU KNOW PUTTING THE PRE

00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:02.247
EXISTING CONDITION PROTECTIONS

00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:03.815
ON THE LINE AT THIS POINT IT IS

00:33:03.882 --> 00:33:04.950
SORT OF NONSENSICAL AND I THINK

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:06.351
SOMETHING THAT WILL HURT A LOT

00:33:06.418 --> 00:33:08.353
OF PEOPLE IN CERTAINLY. AS WE

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.157
DON'T AS WE KNOW MORE MORE MORE

00:33:12.224 --> 00:33:12.791
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WE DON'T

00:33:12.858 --> 00:33:15.327
KNOW RIGHT NOW. YEAH OKAY.

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:19.197
SENATOR THIS IS- DEBRA. I WOULD

00:33:19.264 --> 00:33:20.765
LIKE TO ADD THAT WE DO KNOW A

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:22.801
FEW THINGS AND I THINK IT'S

00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:24.903
IMPORTANT TO SET THAT CONTEXT

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.938
WE KNOW THAT THE DECISION

00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.107
BEFORE THE ACA THE DECISION ON

00:33:29.174 --> 00:33:30.108
WHAT WOULD BE A PRE EXISTING

00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:32.077
CONDITION HOW FAR BACK IT WOULD

00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:34.546
GO WHAT WOULD COUNT WITH THE

00:33:34.613 --> 00:33:36.248
RATIONALE ALL OF THOSE

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:37.582
DECISIONS WERE MADE BY THE

00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:39.484
HEALTH PLANS WITH ZERO

00:33:39.551 --> 00:33:41.686
GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT. AND

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.622
THERE WAS NO LIMIT ON WHAT THEY

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.757
COULD SAY AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:33:45.824 --> 00:33:47.325
YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:49.394
EXAMPLES ONE EXAMPLE THAT COMES

00:33:49.461 --> 00:33:51.663
TO MY MIND IS THAT YOU COULD BE

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.065
DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE YOU

00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:55.467
WERE A BAD WEATHER BEYOND

00:33:55.534 --> 00:33:57.636
NORMAL POTTY TRAINING YEARS AND

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:59.437
YOU COULD BE NOW S. FORTY YEAR

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:01.506
OLD PERSON AND YOU COULD BE

00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:03.108
DENIED COVERAGE BASED ON THAT.

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:05.176
BASED ON ALLERGIES BASED ON

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:07.045
LOTS OF THINGS THAT WERE NOT

00:34:07.112 --> 00:34:08.613
EITHER EVEN PRESENT IN YOUR

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.015
CURRENT HEALTH STATUS OR THAT

00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:11.850
WERE NOT WHAT WE THINK OF AS

00:34:11.917 --> 00:34:14.386
REALLY SERIOUS CONDITIONS SO

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:16.755
AND IT'S CERTAINLY LIKELY MORE

00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:19.624
THAN LIKELY REALLY THAT THE

00:34:19.691 --> 00:34:20.525
HEALTH PLANS WOULD JUST SAY

00:34:20.592 --> 00:34:21.893
BECAUSE IT WAS A PRE EXISTING

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.628
CONDITION AND THEY DON'T REALLY

00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:25.864
NEED TO MAKE A CASE TO ANYONE-

00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:27.332
THAT THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE FOR

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:28.934
THAT AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHY

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.969
IT'S SUCH A- FRIGHTENING

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:32.938
PROSPECT BECAUSE WE GO BACK TO

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:34.673
A TIME. AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:35.874
AGREE WITH EACH OTHER YOU KNOW

00:34:35.941 --> 00:34:37.275
DEPENDING ON THE HEALTH PLAN

00:34:37.342 --> 00:34:38.476
THEY WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:41.913
CRITERIA. AND STANDARDS FOR

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:46.418
THAT. THANK YOU SIR RUBIO- I

00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:48.119
DID ALSO HAVE A QUESTION

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:50.822
PARTICULARLY FOR. DIFFICULT SIR

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.324
FALLING APART CENTER RUBIO SAID

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.359
CAN CAN YOU- PER DO YOU HAVE AN

00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:56.361
ESTIMATE FOR THE NUMBER OF

00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:58.229
PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS PRIOR

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.998
TO THE ACA WHO HAD A PRE

00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:01.266
EXISTING CONDITION SO WE TALK

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:02.734
ABOUT PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:03.802
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU TALKING

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:05.036
ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE EITHER

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.806
DENIED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OR-

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:09.507
HAVE TO PAY MUCH HIGHER RATES

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.343
FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:12.043
BECAUSE OF PRE EXISTING

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.345
CONDITION HOW MANY. PEOPLE OR

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:15.680
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE HAD A

00:35:15.747 --> 00:35:17.282
PRE EXISTING CONDITION I WANTED

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:19.517
HIM TO INSURANCE. PRIOR TO THE

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:20.719
EIGHT MONTHS YEAH THAT'S A GOOD

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.721
QUESTION CENTER I. A QUESTION I

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:23.922
SHOULD HAVE DEFINITELY LOOKED

00:35:23.989 --> 00:35:25.690
UP BEFORE THE HEARING BUT MY

00:35:25.757 --> 00:35:28.159
RECOLLECTION IS THAT- IN THE

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:32.998
TIME PERIOD. BEFORE THE ACA WE

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:36.368
CAN EXPECT THAT 2230% OF PEOPLE

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:37.802
WITH BUDGET BE DENIED HEALTH

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:39.804
INSURANCE. AT A MINIMUM THOSE

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:41.706
WHERE THE LOW ESTIMATES. AND

00:35:41.773 --> 00:35:43.608
REMEMBER THERE WAS LOTS AND

00:35:43.675 --> 00:35:45.777
LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD

00:35:45.844 --> 00:35:46.544
THE WORLD AND DIDN'T EVEN

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:48.680
APPLY- WHEN THEY HAD HEALTH

00:35:48.747 --> 00:35:54.419
CONDITIONS AND WE HAD A VERY.

00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:56.187
INSUFFICIENT PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:57.689
WHO HAD BEEN AND DENY COVERAGE

00:35:57.756 --> 00:35:59.658
THEY THEY HAD TO DENY ALL FROM

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:00.558
TWO DIFFERENT COMPANIES THEY

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:01.993
COULD BE IN OUR HIGH RISK POOL

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.163
AT THE TIME AND- IT WAS A

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.832
QUITE. A QUITE A DIVERSE ARRAY

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:09.734
OF REASONS BUT SO I THINK.

00:36:09.801 --> 00:36:11.736
PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THAT

00:36:11.803 --> 00:36:14.606
RANGE IS THE NUMBER 2230% OF

00:36:14.673 --> 00:36:16.708
AMERICANS HAVE DEPENDING ON HOW

00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:18.443
YOU THINK ABOUT IT. AND I THINK

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.278
THOSE ESTIMATES ARE ALWAYS LOW

00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:22.147
BECAUSE I DO THINK PEOPLE GO TO

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:24.449
THESE BROADER HEALTH CONDITIONS

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:25.884
THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT MIGHT BE

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.385
A PREVIOUS LIKE HEART DISEASE

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:30.255
LIKE CANCER LIKE AIDS HIV.

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:32.157
THOSE KINDS OF OBVIOUS LAW-

00:36:32.223 --> 00:36:34.392
EXPENSIVE CONDITIONS BUT I

00:36:34.459 --> 00:36:35.293
DON'T THINK THEY REALLY TAKE

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.128
INTO ACCOUNT HOW BROAD THE

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:38.830
CRITERIA THE HEALTH PLANS FOR

00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:40.865
USING AT THE TIME. AND THAT

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:42.934
JUST WOULD ADD EVEN TO THE

00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:45.704
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.839
BE ELIGIBLE. THANK YOU AFTER

00:36:47.906 --> 00:36:50.108
THAT- WHAT THE MIRACLE OF- THE

00:36:50.175 --> 00:36:51.776

CENTERS FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID

00:36:59.317 --> 00:36:59.951
SERVICES SAID I THINK IT DOES

00:37:00.018 --> 00:37:01.853
SPEAK TO SEE SOME VARIABILITY

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.420
IN TERMS OF HOW THE MEASURE

00:37:02.487 --> 00:37:04.823
THAT- NINETEEN TO FIFTY

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.991
PERCENT. ONE IN TWO AMERICANS.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:10.095
AT AT EIGHT PREVIOUS IN

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:10.862

00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:14.799

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:54.604
TO SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:57.007
ESPECIALLY SECOND LANGUAGE-

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:58.141
COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S GONNA

01:02:58.208 --> 01:02:59.943
BE A LOT OUT MASS CONFUSION AND

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.011
ANXIETY AND I THINK THIS

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.479
GENERALLY. YOU KNOW EVERYWHERE

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.281
IN CALIFORNIA BUT IS THERE

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.216
SOMETHING IN PLACE TO GET AHEAD

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:07.784
OF THIS HOW ARE WE GOING TO

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:11.254
DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:11.988
TWENTY GETS HERE. CAN ANYBODY

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:17.460
ANSWER THEM. FOR SO I CAN START

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:19.262
AND THEN OTHERS CAN DEFINITELY

01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:21.831
CHIME IN SO- AGAIN G. C. COOPER

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:24.334
HERE- ON YOU KNOW WE ARE

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:26.269
LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF ASPECTS

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:28.538
IN REGARDS TO A CONTINGENCY

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:29.239
PLANNING I THINK THERE WOULD

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.041
HAVE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:32.742
OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.011
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CMS- IN

01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:36.646
REGARDS TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:38.281
BUT THIS WOULD MEAN A LOT OF

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:40.050
THAT IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:42.385
DEPEND ON WHAT IS DECIDED ON

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:44.788
THE BUT I AS WE OUTLINED IN THE

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:47.324
IMPACTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT-

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.491
YOU KNOW THREE POINT EIGHT

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:49.659
MILLION ADULTS WHO ARE

01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:51.094
CURRENTLY BEING COVERED BY THE

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.630
OPTIONAL EXPANSION. AS WELL AS

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:55.265
OTHERS WHO HAVE BENEFITTED FROM

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:59.569
ON THE. SIMPLIFIED ELIGIBILITY

01:03:59.636 --> 01:04:01.071
RULES AND MET HOW THE IMPACT

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.839
WOULD BE SICK TO CAL ON WITH

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:04.007
EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:05.141
FEDERAL FUNDS CURRENTLY IN OUR

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.143
CURRENT BUDGET- WE WOULD HAVE

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.912
TO MAKE SERIOUS DECISIONS IN

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:11.681
CALIFORNIA AROUND COVERAGE-

01:04:11.748 --> 01:04:13.249
CLEARLY IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS A

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:15.251
PRIORITY FOR NOT ONLY THE

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:16.686
MEDICAID PROGRAM BUT FOR THE

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:18.822
STATE AS A WHOLE I'M ENSURING

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:20.290
PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.058
CARE FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVING

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.493
THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.562
RIGHTS- IT THAT SOMEONE SHOULD

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.263
AUDIT ALL INDIVIDUAL SHOULD

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:29.132
HAVE ACCESS TO- THERE WOULD BE

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:30.900
HARD BUDGET DECISIONS IN FRONT

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.068
OF US BUT A LOT OF THAT'S

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:34.237
REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON. THE

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:35.338
DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE SO IT'S

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:38.041
HARD TO DO YOU MUCH CONTINGENCY

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:39.642
PLANNING BECAUSE OF THERE BEING

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:42.011
SO MANY THINGS THAT STILL NEED

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.580
TO BE DECIDED I WOULD ALSO

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:45.849
IMAGINE WITH ANY SIGNIFICANT

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.484
CHANGE BUT WOULD BE HAPPY FOR

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.352
OTHERS TO WEIGH IN THERE WOULD

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:50.787
HAVE TO BE A TRANSITION OR GOT

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:52.922
A GLIDE PATH ON THEIR FEDERAL

PROTECTIONS A BENEFICIARY PER

WITHOUT THE ACA IS A

01:06:23.947 --> 01:06:26.049
CATASTROPHIC FUTURE AND I THINK

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:27.684
THAT YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATORS

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:28.751
HERE IN WASHINGTON NEED TO

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.520
ADDRESS THAT REALITY- I THINK

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:31.955
PART OF THE POINT OF THIS

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:32.789
HEARING IS TO MAKE SURE NOT

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:34.958
ONLY CALIFORNIANS BUT A MEMBER

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:36.493
OF THE SUPREME COURT-

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.228
UNDERSTAND HOW CATASTROPHIC IT

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:40.063
SHOULD BE. AND THE AGAIN THE

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:43.433
ALTERNATIVES ARE SO GRIM THAT

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.334
IN A COULD SEE PLANS TO OUR

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.302
MINDS REALLY ARE WHAT WE CAN OR

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:48.805
SHOULD FOCUS OUR TIME ON ITS ON

01:06:48.872 --> 01:06:51.341
THE JOB OF TODAY WHICH IS

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:52.876
GETTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:55.011
OF CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE TODAY

01:06:55.078 --> 01:06:56.279
TO GET COVERAGE THEY NEED SO

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:57.680
THEY GET TESTED FOR CULVERT SO

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:58.948
THEY GET THE CARE THEY NEED AND

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.750
THAT'S WHAT OUR FOCUS AND-

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:01.851
AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:03.820

COURT CASES REPEAL AND REPLACE

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.592
BUT ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:11.861
EXPANDING SUBSIDIES ADDRESSING

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:13.863
WHAT CALIFORNIANS DID FOR

01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:15.198
MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS THAT

01:07:15.265 --> 01:07:18.701
IN THE ACA GOT NO HELP UNTIL

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:19.669
THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:22.105

WE'D RATHER PUT OUR EFFORTS

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.647

SOMETHING OF THAT MAGNITUDE

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:41.558
GIVEN HOW MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:44.561

PLANNING FOR THAT EVENTUALITY

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:52.001
WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.604
TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS- IS

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:56.072
AN INCREDIBLY LARGE SUM OF

01:07:56.139 --> 01:07:57.907

UNDERSTANDING AND SO IT RESET

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.116
IT WOULD REPRESENT A SIZEABLE

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:09.819
INCREASE. IN THE NECESSARY

01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:12.021
STATE RESOURCES TO EXTEND THE

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.690
AMOUNT OF COVERAGE AND

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.992
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR COVERAGE-

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:17.827
THAT CURRENTLY GOES TO

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:18.962
CALIFORNIA IN THE STATE SO THAT

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.530
WOULD BE. YOU KNOW NEED TO BE

VERY SERIOUS AND PERHAPS

01:08:22.632 --> 01:08:23.900
DIFFICULT THAT DECISIONS WOULD

01:08:23.967 --> 01:08:25.601

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:39.876
SO THEY WERE A BARRIER FOR

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.277
PEOPLE GETTING CARE SO

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:42.612
PROVIDING AS LITTLE CARE AS

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:43.980
POSSIBLE THOSE ARE COVERED AND

01:09:44.047 --> 01:09:45.048
THAT'S ONE OF THE BILL THE

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:47.050
PREMIUM AND THEN HUGE AMOUNTS

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:47.884
FOR OVERHEAD THAT OUR

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:50.420
CONTROLLED BY SOMETHING CALLED

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:51.788
MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS. WHICH

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.222
STATE HEALTH PLANS MUST NOW

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:54.791
SPEND. THE VAST MAJORITY

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.693
PREMIUMS ON HEALTH CARE. SO

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:58.227
WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THE ACA

01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:01.164
IN CALIFORNIA- THE REASON WE'VE

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.999
DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB OF

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.167
KEEPING PREMIUM INCREASE OF

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:06.502
RELATIVELY LOW IS. WE'VE GOT

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:08.805
HEALTHY PEOPLE IN. WE MAKE IT

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.573
WORK FOR EVERYONE MORE PEOPLE

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.408
GETTING IN MEANS A HEALTHIER

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:14.177
RISK MIX. AND I WANT TO LOOK AT

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:15.511
THE LAST THREE YEARS TO MAKE IT

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:17.980
CLEAR ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:18.681
BETWEEN LOCAL ACTION AND

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:20.283
FEDERAL ACTION. THREE YEARS AGO

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:21.951
TWENTY NINETEEN. THE FEDERAL

01:10:22.018 --> 01:10:23.753
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THERE

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.621
WOULD NO LONGER BE. A FEDERAL

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:28.424
PENALTY. BUT IN THAT YEAR

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:30.493
PREMIUMS IN CALIFORNIA WENT UP

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.261
ABOUT NINE PERCENT. BECAUSE

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:34.397
HEALTH PLANS SAID. PEOPLE ARE

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:36.199
GOING TO. ABANDON COVERAGE%

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:38.634
BECAUSE THAT EXTRA KNOWLEDGE OF

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:39.302
THE PENALTY WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.738
MEANT. CALIFORNIA THE AND I

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:43.072
REALLY NEED TO PRAISE THIS

01:10:43.139 --> 01:10:45.708
LEGISLATURE THIS GOVERNOR DID

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:46.909
TWO BIG THINGS IN INDIVIDUAL

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:49.278
MARKETS. ADDED SUBSIDIES STATE

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:50.346
SUBSIDIES SUPPLEMENT THE

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:51.748
FEDERAL WHICH MEANS MORE PEOPLE

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.483
TO SIGN UP BUT ALSO SAID WE'RE

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:55.084
GONNA STATE PENALTY. WHAT

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:56.853
HAPPENED LAST YEAR OR PREMIUMS

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.288
WENT UP POINT 8% THIS YEAR

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:01.124
THEY'RE GOING UP POINT FIVE.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.692
THAT MEANS OVER THE THREE YEARS

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:04.293
SINCE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN IN

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.162
OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA. THE

01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:08.498
AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE HAS

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:10.967
BEEN LESS THAN 3% AND THE

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:15.004
REASON IS. HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:17.507
ARE DRIVEN BY WHO'S INSURED AND

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:19.742
UNDER THE ACA HAVING POLICIES

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:21.410
THAT ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:22.445
INJURED TO GET CARE WHEN THEY

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:24.714
NEED IT THAT'S A WORKING MARKET

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.716
PLACE THAT'S A MODEL THAT WORKS

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.985
NOT HAVING SHE PREMIUMS BECAUSE

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.153
YOU'RE DENYING PEOPLE ACCESS TO

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:31.754
CARE AND HAVING INSURANCE

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:33.055
COMPANIES GAMING THE SYSTEM TO

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.457
ACTUALLY NOT BE THERE WHEN YOU

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:35.591
NEED IT I THINK THAT'S A REALLY

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:36.993
THE MODEL WHAT THE AC IS

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.327
WORKING PRETTY WELL IN

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:40.096
CALIFORNIA. EVEN THOUGH

01:11:40.163 --> 01:11:42.098
SUBSIDIES ACTUALLY SHOULD BE

01:11:42.165 --> 01:11:43.266
RICHER FOR LOWER INCOME

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:44.967
CALIFORNIA PEOPLE STILL NEED

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:46.936
HELP BUT WE GOT A SYSTEM THAT'S

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:49.806
WORKING WELL YOU LOOK OUTSIDE

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:52.909
OF CALIFORNIA TEXAS ALMOST ONE

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:54.677
OUT OF FIVE TEXANS WITHOUT

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:55.711
INSURANCE ABOUT EIGHTEEN

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.079
PERCENT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.015
THEY HAVEN'T EXPANDED MEDICAID

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:00.817
AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.718
PREMIUMS HAVE SKYROCKETED SO

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:05.621
HIGH THERE ARE NOT UNSUBSIDIZED

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:06.556
PEOPLE LEFT EXCEPT FOR SICK

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:10.626
PEOPLE CALIFORNIA HAS OVER

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:11.294
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.161
UNSUBSIDIZED CALIFORNIANS WE

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:13.830
CAN STILL AFFORD INSURANCE

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.231
BECAUSE OUR EFFORTS BRING

01:12:15.298 --> 01:12:18.467
ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE POOL TO

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:19.168
KEEP PRICES DOWN FOR EVERYBODY.

01:12:19.235 --> 01:12:20.069
NO THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S A

01:12:20.136 --> 01:12:21.938
VERY IMPORTANT POINT- BECAUSE I

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.372
OFTENTIMES PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:24.540
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW FAST

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:25.608
PREMIUMS ARE GROWING BUT THE

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.076
FACT AND COVER CALIFORNIA IN

01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:28.711
THE LAST TWO YEARS. EACH YEAR

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:30.279
IT'S GONE UP BY LESS THAN A

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.781
PERCENT WHICH IS I BELIEVE LESS

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:34.517
THAN INFLATION. I WOULD ALSO

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:36.285
POINT OUT I THINK WHEN-

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:37.353
SCHWARZENEGGER'S GOVERNOR

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.321
LOOKING HEALTH REFORM HERE

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:40.456
CALIFORNIA PRE ACA THOSE

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:43.192
ESTIMATED THAT FOR EVERY PERSON

01:12:43.259 --> 01:12:44.994
WHO ACTUALLY HAD INSURANCE-

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:45.995
THERE WAS PART WE TRY TO

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.964
SUBSIDIZE THE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.032
PER. PERSON FOR THE PEOPLE WHO

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.434
DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE BECAUSE

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.202
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE INSURANCE

01:12:53.269 --> 01:12:54.704
DON'T STOP GETTING SICK THEIR

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.906
PROBLEMS DON'T GO AWAY. SO THEY

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:58.241
WILL EVENTUALLY SHOW FOR CARE

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:00.176
AND THAT CARE BECAUSE THEY

01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:02.211
CAN'T AFFORD IT. WILL THEN BE

01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:03.779
SENSUALLY PASSED ON TO EVERYONE

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.882
ELSE WHO HAS INSURANCE AND WHO

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:08.517
IS ABLE TO FINANCE IT. AND SO

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:09.752
IT CREATED A LOT OF-

01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:12.655
DYSFUNCTIONAL THIS. FINANCING

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:16.459
WHICH I THINK YOU SEE A HELP

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:17.693
ADDRESS. I GUESS THE OTHER

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.961
QUESTION I DO WANT TO TEST YOU

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:22.298
PURELY IS- YOU KNOW WE TALK

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:23.633
ABOUT AND PEOPLE SAY WELL LOOK

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:25.268
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AND- I

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:26.669
THINK- YOU KNOW BEN JOHNSON

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.738
TALKED ABOUT. CAME TO THE STATE

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:29.438
AND WE'RE PROVIDING CITY

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:32.208
SUBSIDIES. WHERE DOES THAT

01:13:32.275 --> 01:13:35.311
MONEY GO- THE I MEAN THERE.

01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:38.381
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:39.015
TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE RIGHT

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.917
DOESN'T CREATE JOBS. FOR A

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:43.786
COUPLE THINGS NOTED IS- PUT IN

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:45.588
AMERICA IN CALIFORNIA WILL

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:46.889
REMIND YOU THAT. ABOUT HALF OF

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:47.957
CALIFORNIANS HAVE HEALTHCARE

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:49.792
COVERAGE TO THEIR EMPLOYER. NOW

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:50.960
ABOUT A THIRD THROUGH MEDICARE

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:54.030
L. AND THE BALANCE THROUGH

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:54.730
COVERED CALIFORNIA THE SOURCES.

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:56.132
IF YOU HAVE EMPLOYER COVERAGE.

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:57.900
YOU'RE GETTING A FEDERAL TAX

01:13:57.967 --> 01:13:59.468
SUBSIDY TO GET THAT COVERAGE.

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:00.736

GET A FEDERAL STATE SUBSIDY TO

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:03.673
COVER. THE INDIVIDUAL MARK WAS

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.107
THE ONE MARKET WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:06.809
SAYING YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. THE

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:08.177
ACA SAID NO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:12.281
EVERYONE A LEG UP. THE OTHER

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:13.950
THING THE ACA SAID IS. FIFTEEN

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:15.685
YEARS AGO SOME HEALTH PLANS

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:17.687
LITERALLY WE'RE SPENDING HALF

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:18.788
OF THE PREMIUM DOLLARS ON

SOME OF THESE PLANS WERE PRETTY

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:30.933
BAD PLANS. NOW THOUGHTHE

HEALTHCARE WHICH MEANS PEOPLE.

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:47.850

MARKETING BY GETTING MORE

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.742

CAL I DID NOT TOUCH ON MENTAL

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:42.638
HEALTH BECAUSE- IN A WORD COBIT

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:44.373
NOW AND- CERTAINLY THE VIRUS

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.642
ITSELF IS IT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.044
WE NEED TO BE SURE PEOPLE HAVE

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.311
ACCESS TO NOT YOU KNOW THE

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.313
TESTING AND THE TREATMENT. BUT

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.014
ALSO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:54.316
STRESS AND STRAIN PEOPLE TALK

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:55.017
ABOUT THE INCREASE MENTAL

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:56.952
HEALTH BURDEN. THAT'S HAPPENING

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:59.221
BECAUSE OF CODED- CAN YOU SPEAK

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.123
A LITTLE BIT TOO IF THE WHAT

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:02.525
WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ACA GOT

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:05.561
OVERTURNED TO PEOPLE'S ACCESS

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:06.262
TO MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH THE

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:09.932
MEDICAID PROGRAM. SURE I'M SO.

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:12.802

HAVE TO MAKE IN THE FUTURE-

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:24.099
WHEN IT IS COVERED TODAY. IT IS

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:25.234

AVAILABLE THROUGH MEDICARE- SO

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:51.460
IT COULD HAVE A GREAT IMPACT IN

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:52.695

I LEFT- THE TEACHING PROFESSION

01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:14.797
TO MOVEMENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP SO

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:15.964

01:22:53.202 --> 01:22:55.337
AFTER. THE NEGOTIATED RATE HAD

01:22:55.404 --> 01:22:57.573
KICKED IN FOR MY SERVICES THAT

01:22:57.639 --> 01:23:01.043
I USE-I OWED MY- CARE

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:02.644
PROVIDERS FIFTY THREE THOUSAND

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:04.413
DOLLARS AND HAVING LEFT A

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.547
STABLE JOB TO MOVE IN

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:07.749
ENTREPRENEURSHIP I DIDN'T HAVE

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:08.450
FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:23:08.517 --> 01:23:10.052
LYING AROUND READY TO GO. AND

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:11.520
SO TO GO BACK TO WHAT SENATOR

ANNUAL CAPS WERE REALLY

01:23:15.257 --> 01:23:17.159
IMPACTFUL FOR ME WITH THE ACA

01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:19.194

TEXT RIGHT YOU SIGNIFICANTLY

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.570
LESS PAINFUL THAN TRYING TO

COME UP WITH FIFTY THREE

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:30.305
THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THE OTHER

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:32.341

IF WE GO BACK TO A PRE ACA. I'M

DAUGHTER WOULD NOT SURVIVE

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:44.226
RIGHT. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:45.026
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:47.429
ENACTED. JUST A FEW YEARS PRIOR

BE DENIED COVERAGE. MICHAEL IS

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:53.889
CONDITION THAT CAN CAUSE SPINAL

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:55.857
FUSION AND DAMAGE OTHER JOINTS

01:29:55.924 --> 01:29:58.260
AND ORGANS IT'S PAINFUL

01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:02.430
EXHAUSTING AND PROGRESSIVE.
AND-PATIENTS NEED ROUTINE

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:05.734
SPECIALIZED TREATMENT AND CARE.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.869
SO I KNEW I HAD THIS DISEASE

01:30:07.936 --> 01:30:09.804
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A DIAGNOSIS

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:10.472
AND I DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:13.141
INSURANCE. AND THE ACA WAS

01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:15.410
EIGHT MONTHS AWAY. I COULD

01:30:15.477 --> 01:30:17.712
BARELY FUNCTION SO I NEEDED TO

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:19.781
BEGIN TREATMENT SOON BUT I

01:30:19.848 --> 01:30:21.483
DIDN'T WANT TO BE FOR HAVING A

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:23.685
PRE EXISTING CONDITION. I

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:25.854
NEEDED INSURANCE FIRST. SO I

01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:28.023
APPLIED FOR A BARE BONES PLAN

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:30.225
ON A PART TIME SALARY AND WHEN

01:30:30.292 --> 01:30:31.893
AN INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:35.830
INTERVIEWED ME ABOUT ANY HEALTH

01:30:35.897 --> 01:30:36.765
ISSUES. I LIED. I TOLD HER MY

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:39.968
HEALTH WAS GREAT. I LIED MY WAY

01:30:40.035 --> 01:30:42.504
INTO CHEAP HEALTH INSURANCE. MY

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:43.905
PLAN HAD HIGH COPAYS AND

01:30:43.972 --> 01:30:46.508
DEDUCTIBLES. WHEN I SAW A

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:48.276
RHEUMATOLOGIST FOR THE FIRST

01:30:48.343 --> 01:30:50.378
TIME I BEGGED HIM TO DIAGNOSE

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:52.380
ME BASED SOLELY ON MY SYMPTOM

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.416
HISTORY AND AN OFFICE VISIT

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:56.284
EVEN THOUGH BLOOD WORK AND X.

01:30:56.351 --> 01:30:58.320
RAYS WERE REQUIRED. I SHOULD

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:00.021
HAVE BEEN GRIEVING THIS LIFE

01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:02.724
CHANGING DIAGNOSIS INSTEAD I

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:05.160
WAS STILL VERY SICK AND BEING

01:31:05.226 --> 01:31:07.095
FORCED TO MAKE CHOICES THAT PUT

01:31:07.162 --> 01:31:09.097
MY HEALTH AT RISK LIKE SAYING

01:31:09.164 --> 01:31:11.533
NO THE NECESSARY TRUE TESTS AND

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:15.170
MONITORING. I ABSOLUTELY DON'T

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.605
WISH MY EXPERIENCE ON ANYONE.

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:19.674
WHEN THE ACA ARRIVED I GOT A

01:31:19.741 --> 01:31:21.142

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.528

CAN SPEAK TO THAT- EVEN THOUGH

01:37:41.856 --> 01:37:45.626
MY STORY IS DIFFERENT- THE

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:47.228
MEDICAID EXPANSION ACTUALLY

01:37:47.295 --> 01:37:49.230
ALLOWED ME TO STOP WORKING- MY

01:37:49.297 --> 01:37:53.301
HEALTH WAS- GETTING SO BAD THAT

01:37:53.368 --> 01:37:56.003
I WAS ONLY GOING TO WORK AND

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:57.372
THEN COLLAPSING AS SOON AS I

01:37:57.438 --> 01:38:00.708
GOT HOME BUT BECAUSE OF MY

01:38:00.775 --> 01:38:02.777
ABILITY TO SORT OF MAINTAIN AND

01:38:02.844 --> 01:38:04.112
MANAGE MY HEALTH BETTER ON

01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:06.781
MEDICAID- I WAS ABLE TO BEGIN

01:38:06.848 --> 01:38:08.750
FREELANCING AND DOING WRITING

01:38:08.816 --> 01:38:10.284

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:12.453
IT ALLOWED ME TO WORK. IN A WAY

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.255
THAT I COULD ACTUALLY MANAGE

01:38:14.322 --> 01:38:17.225
RATHER THAN BEING PUSHED INTO.

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:20.094

01:51:41.995 --> 01:51:43.564
IF THE ACA'S REPEALED THIS

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:44.831
CHAOS WOULD AFFECT MILLIONS

ACA I'M DOING ITS STRUCTURE IN

01:52:21.602 --> 01:52:22.502
THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC WOULD

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:24.404
HAVE DEVASTATING REAL LIFE

01:52:24.471 --> 01:52:26.173

STRUGGLING IN THE MIDST OF THE

01:52:30.611 --> 01:52:32.679
PANDEMIC. THIS IS WHY ALL OF US

01:52:32.746 --> 01:52:33.847
MUST DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING

01:52:33.914 --> 01:52:35.749
IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT AND

01:52:35.816 --> 01:52:36.550

PARTICIPANTS. JUST A VERY BRIEF

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:56.303
FIVE QUESTION FOR- ACTUALLY I

AND LESLIE ABOUT THE COMINGS-

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:02.409
SO I REALLY CAN'T CREATE ALL

01:53:02.476 --> 01:53:03.710
THE PANELISTS TALKING ABOUT THE

01:53:03.777 --> 01:53:05.679
IMPACT OF THE C. ON PATIENTS

01:53:05.746 --> 01:53:06.346

ALWAYS COME FIRST- BUT I DO

01:53:07.914 --> 01:53:08.782
WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:53:08.849 --> 01:53:11.184
ECONOMIC IMPACTS SO HE JUST. IN

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:13.387
A VERY BRIEF CANCER- SHE IS

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:15.489
POSSIBLE SIR SAFETY AC WAS

01:53:15.555 --> 01:53:17.858

JOBS DO YOU THINK YOU'D- BE

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:23.697
WOULD BE LOST- IN IT AT YOUR

01:53:23.764 --> 01:53:25.499
FACILITY. WHICH OF COURSE HAS

01:53:25.565 --> 01:53:27.034
AN IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY- AND

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:31.538

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:39.313
HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION

01:53:39.379 --> 01:53:40.947
DOLLAR LOSS IN FUNDING FOR

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:41.848
SERVICES THAT WE CURRENTLY

01:53:41.915 --> 01:53:43.917
PROVIDE. ENOUGH OF OUR A LITTLE

01:53:43.984 --> 01:53:45.185
OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION

01:53:45.252 --> 01:53:47.688
DOLLAR BUDGET SO ABOUT 15% OF

01:53:47.754 --> 01:53:48.955
OUR BUDGET WOULD BE LAST WHICH

01:53:49.022 --> 01:53:49.790
MEANS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO

01:53:49.856 --> 01:53:52.326
LOOK BACK. AT OUR ON. THE

01:53:52.392 --> 01:53:54.328
SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:55.929
AND START TO EVALUATE WHICH

01:53:55.996 --> 01:53:57.264
ONES WE CAN AND CANNOT CONTINUE

01:53:57.331 --> 01:53:58.832
TO PROVIDE THE WE WOULD HAVE IF

01:53:58.899 --> 01:54:01.802
WE CLOSE RANKS. M. IF WE

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:03.804
ELIMINATED SERVICES. THOSE ARE

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:05.439
THE KINDS OF THINGS BATES THAT

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:07.240
REPORT FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:07.808
DEMONSTRATED THE COUNTY

01:54:07.874 --> 01:54:09.142
RIVERSIDE WITH LIZ WHILE

01:54:09.209 --> 01:54:11.511
THOUSAND. TWELVE THOUSAND

01:54:11.578 --> 01:54:13.447
POSITIONS ACROSS THE COUNTY

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:14.247
THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:16.416
OUR REGION. AND I DON'T HAVE A

01:54:16.483 --> 01:54:18.552
NUMBER FOR YOU ABOUT. WHAT THAT

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:20.187
WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR US BUT I

01:54:20.253 --> 01:54:21.054
WOULD ALSO SAY WE'D BE LOOKING

01:54:21.121 --> 01:54:23.657
AT. HOW MANY FREE HOW MUCH FREE

01:54:23.724 --> 01:54:25.659
CARE WE CAN GIVEN HOW MANY FREE

01:54:25.726 --> 01:54:27.127
PRESCRIPTONS WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:54:27.194 --> 01:54:28.628
CONTINUE TO FILL. AND WE'RE

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:30.330
PROVIDING A LOT OF SERVICES TO

01:54:30.397 --> 01:54:32.165
UNINSURED. AS WELL THAT WE

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:38.505
WOULD HAVE TO. SCALE BACK THEM.

01:54:38.572 --> 01:54:39.072
BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO

01:54:39.139 --> 01:54:40.140
FUNCTION. THANK YOU. THE

01:54:40.207 --> 01:54:42.075
LEGISLATIVE THE COMING YOU'RE

RUNNING. OR HELLO HAVE. SO AND

01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:49.449
I THINK AND I THINK FOR US THE

01:54:49.516 --> 01:54:50.951
IMPACT WOULD ACTUALLY BE FAR

01:54:51.017 --> 01:54:54.187
GREATER AND WE EXPANDED ACCESS-

01:54:54.254 --> 01:54:56.590
NOT BUYING OVER AT THAT SIX

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:58.291
ADDITIONAL ACCESS POINTS THAT

01:54:58.358 --> 01:54:59.760
ALL COME WITH STAFFING THAT

01:54:59.826 --> 01:55:01.428
WENT ALONG WITH EACH ONE OF

01:55:01.495 --> 01:55:04.197
THEM AND SO AND IF WE AND I IF

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:05.699
I HAD TO PUT A PERCENTAGE TO IT

01:55:05.766 --> 01:55:08.201
OUR OUR EXPANSION OF ACCESS TO

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:10.771
SERVICES COULD BE CLOSER 230%

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:12.406
OF OUR BUDGET BECAUSE OF THE

01:55:12.472 --> 01:55:13.640
ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WE WERE ABLE

01:55:13.707 --> 01:55:15.642
TO SEARCH AND THAT WAS OVER THE

01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:17.744
COURSE OF TIME FOR THAT- AFTER

01:55:17.811 --> 01:55:19.780
THE PORTAL CARE ACT. WAS PASSED

01:55:19.846 --> 01:55:22.048
ON AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD

01:55:22.115 --> 01:55:23.583
ACTUALLY RESULT IN THE CLOSURE

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:25.385
OF CLINICS REDUCTION OF OURS

01:55:25.452 --> 01:55:27.287
AND CERTAINLY LAYOFFS OF STAFF

01:55:27.354 --> 01:55:29.990
AND BECAUSE OF THE- YOU KNOW

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:32.192
THE CUTS IN FUNDING AND THE-

01:55:32.259 --> 01:55:33.860
ACCESS FOR THOSE PATIENTS AND

01:55:33.927 --> 01:55:35.128
BE UNDER THE INCREASE IN THE

01:55:35.195 --> 01:55:37.230
UNINSURED SO FOR US IT WOULD

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:39.366
BE- YOU KNOW BLESSED ACCESS

01:55:39.433 --> 01:55:41.802
LESS ACCESS POINTS AND MOST

01:55:41.868 --> 01:55:44.070
LIKELY EIGHT IMPACT TO. THE

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:50.010
WORK FORCE AS LONG. THANK YOU.

02:04:33.833 --> 02:04:35.401
DETERMINATION. IT WS OFTEN A

02:04:35.468 --> 02:04:37.070
CATCH TWENTY TWO FOR A LOT OF

02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:38.571
PEOPLE TO GET THE DISABILITY

02:04:38.638 --> 02:04:40.073
DETERMINATION BECAUSE AFTER ALL

02:04:40.139 --> 02:04:42.342
YOU NEED ACCESS TO A DOCTOR WHO

02:04:42.408 --> 02:04:43.242
CAN PROVE THAT YOU HAVE A

02:04:43.309 --> 02:04:46.179
DISABILITY- WITHOUT ACCESS TO

MEDICAL CARE IT BECOMES VERY

02:04:47.547 --> 02:04:49.816
HARD TO PROVE THAT- ON THE

02:04:49.882 --> 02:04:51.918
OTHER SIDE. THIS STATE THEN HAD

02:04:51.985 --> 02:04:52.819

02:04:52.885 --> 02:04:55.121

02:04:56.756 --> 02:04:57.724

02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:59.258
APPLICATIONS WERE BEING DELAYED

02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:00.360
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO LABOR

02:05:00.426 --> 02:05:02.228
INTENSIVE. THE STATE CAN'T JUST

02:05:02.295 --> 02:05:03.529
GIVE OUT HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:04.797
WITHOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY

02:05:04.864 --> 02:05:07.133
FIT THE CRITERIA BY WHICH THE

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:07.767
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD

02:05:07.834 --> 02:05:09.669
REIMBURSE THEM. ONE OF OUR

02:05:09.736 --> 02:05:11.004

02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:13.473
DURING THE CASE- AND I STILL

02:05:13.539 --> 02:05:15.208
REMEMBER HAVING TO TELL ONE OF

02:05:15.274 --> 02:05:16.676

NOW FROM CAL CHAMBERS POSITION

02:11:33.953 --> 02:11:35.688
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE ACA

02:11:35.755 --> 02:11:37.256
REPEAL ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S

02:11:37.323 --> 02:11:39.558
NOT A VIABLE REPLACEMENT THE

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:41.026
EMPLOYER MANDATE THAT CAME

02:11:41.093 --> 02:11:42.762
ALONG WITH THE ACA HAS BEEN

02:11:42.828 --> 02:11:44.764
IMPLEMENTED IN AND AFFECT. OVER

02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:46.732
FIVE YEARS NOW AND SO TO GET TO

02:11:46.799 --> 02:11:48.434
THE POINT WHEREEMPLOYERS AND

02:11:48.501 --> 02:11:50.369
INSURERS WERE ABLE TO OFFER.

02:11:50.436 --> 02:11:52.538
ACA COMPLIANT PLANS IS A HUGE

02:11:52.605 --> 02:11:56.008
LEFT IT TOOK. A HUGE FINANCIAL

02:11:56.075 --> 02:11:58.511
OBLIGATION IT TOOK A HUGE-

02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:00.546
WORKER POWER OBLIGATION IT TOOK

02:12:00.613 --> 02:12:02.114
AN ARMY OF LAWYERS YOU CAN

02:12:02.181 --> 02:12:03.783
IMAGINE. AND WE'RE AT A POINT

02:12:03.849 --> 02:12:05.885
NOW WHERE ACA COMPLIANT PLANS

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:07.052
ARE BEING OFFERED IN THE

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:09.188
WORKPLACE SO. THE CONCERN IS IF

02:12:09.255 --> 02:12:10.956
YOU REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE

02:12:11.023 --> 02:12:12.291
ACT WITHOUT A VIABLE

02:12:12.358 --> 02:12:13.926
REPLACEMENT. IT'S PUTTING

02:12:13.993 --> 02:12:15.428
EMPLOYERS AND INSURERS IN A

02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:16.896
POSITION AGAIN WHERE THEY'RE

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:18.864
GONNA HAVE TO RECREATE. A

02:12:18.931 --> 02:12:22.735
WORKPLACE- A HEALTH PLAN.

02:12:22.802 --> 02:12:23.969
FRAMEWORK WHICH WOULD PROBABLY

02:12:24.036 --> 02:12:26.038
MEAN MORE LAWYERS MORE TIME

02:12:26.105 --> 02:12:27.907
MORE MONEY ANOTHER HUGE HEAVY

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:30.743
LIST- NO WOMAN LOOK AT THE

02:12:30.810 --> 02:12:32.545
POTENTIAL OF AN ACA REPEAL

02:12:32.611 --> 02:12:34.480
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE. FROM AN

02:12:34.547 --> 02:12:36.282
EMPLOYER BASED PERSPECTIVES. I

02:12:36.348 --> 02:12:37.583
WISH I HAD MORE ANSWERS FOR YOU

02:12:37.650 --> 02:12:39.485
TODAY AND I WISH I WAS OFFERING

02:12:39.552 --> 02:12:40.786
MORE INSIGHT IT'S A HUGE

02:12:40.853 --> 02:12:42.822
QUESTION MARK TO BE SURE- IT'S

02:12:42.888 --> 02:12:44.590
REALLY DIFFICULT TO PROJECT. ON

02:12:44.657 --> 02:12:49.462
THE SMALL. EMPLOYER MARKET.

02:12:49.528 --> 02:12:50.262
COOLEY OFFER EMPLOYERS HEALTH

02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:52.865
TO DO THREE SHOP PROGRAM

02:12:52.932 --> 02:12:53.899
THERE'S A TAX CREDIT THAT'S

02:12:53.966 --> 02:12:55.167
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OBVIOUSLY

02:12:55.234 --> 02:12:56.435
THE TAX CREDIT WOULD BE IN

02:12:56.502 --> 02:12:57.837
JEOPARDY THE C. WERE TO BE

02:12:57.903 --> 02:13:00.706
REPEALED- IN REGARDS TO LARGE

02:13:00.773 --> 02:13:03.008
EMPLOYERS. THAT LANDSCAPE IS

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:04.710
ALSO ONE THAT'S UNPREDICTABLE

02:13:04.777 --> 02:13:07.313
THIS TIME THE THOUGHT IS YOU

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:09.215
WOULD GO BACK TO A PRE ACA.

02:13:09.281 --> 02:13:11.517
FRAMEWORK IN SO WHAT WOULD THAT

02:13:11.584 --> 02:13:13.752
MEAN WELL. UNDER THE ACA LARGE

02:13:13.819 --> 02:13:15.688
EMPLOYERS MEANING FIFTY OR MORE

02:13:15.754 --> 02:13:17.590
EMPLOYEES THAT WORK FOR A AN

02:13:17.656 --> 02:13:19.992
ORGANIZATION. THE FULL TIME

02:13:20.059 --> 02:13:21.594
WORKERS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:22.895
SUPPOSED TO GET COVERED BY THE

02:13:22.962 --> 02:13:24.797
EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLAN. NOW

02:13:24.864 --> 02:13:26.131
FULL TIME WORKERS UP TO FORTY

02:13:26.198 --> 02:13:27.800
HOURS A WEEK ON THE BBC IT'S

02:13:27.867 --> 02:13:29.902
THIRTY HOURS A WEEK- FOR HOURS

02:13:29.969 --> 02:13:31.804
WORKED SO THE IDEA IS IF THERE

02:13:31.871 --> 02:13:33.906
IS A REPEAL OF THE ACA.

02:13:33.973 --> 02:13:36.008
EMPLOYERS ARE NOW OFFERING

02:13:36.075 --> 02:13:39.512
THEIR OWN PLANS AGAIN LIKE THEY

02:13:39.578 --> 02:13:42.047
DID A- DECADE AGO. THE THOUGHT.

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:44.216
IS THE PLANS WOULD LIKELY BE

02:13:44.283 --> 02:13:46.151
EXTENDED TO FULL TIME WORKERS

02:13:46.218 --> 02:13:47.953
GOING FORTY HOURS A WEEK AS

02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:49.054
OPPOSED TO THOSE WORKING THIRTY

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:51.257
HOURS A WEEK IN THAT SAME VEIN

02:13:51.323 --> 02:13:52.424
YOU PROBABLY SEE AN ELIMINATION

02:13:52.491 --> 02:13:53.626
OF HEALTH PLAN COVERAGE FOR

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:55.494
EMPLOYEES WORK PART TIME OR

02:13:55.561 --> 02:13:58.297
SEASONAL OR TEMPORARY- AGAIN TO

02:13:58.364 --> 02:13:59.765
BE UP TO THE ORGANIZATION SO

02:13:59.832 --> 02:14:02.234
THESE ARE JUST THOUGHTS-

02:14:02.301 --> 02:14:03.969
ADDITIONALLY A REPEAL THE ACA

02:14:04.036 --> 02:14:05.871
COULD MEAN THIRTEEN INCREASE

02:14:05.938 --> 02:14:07.473
THE AMOUNT THAT- EMPLOYEES WHO

02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:09.742
ELECT GROUP HEALTH PLAN

02:14:09.808 --> 02:14:11.076
COVERAGE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE.

02:14:11.143 --> 02:14:13.412
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CREASE

02:14:13.479 --> 02:14:15.781
AC FRAMEWORK ESPECIALLY LARGER

02:14:15.848 --> 02:14:18.417
EMPLOYERS. THE PREVIOUS-

02:14:18.484 --> 02:14:19.818
COVERAGE WAS RATHER

02:14:19.885 --> 02:14:21.253
COMPREHENSIVE AND ROBUST IT WAS

02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.756
THE SMALLER SEGMENT WHERE YOU

02:14:23.822 --> 02:14:25.791
SAW A LOT OF VARIATION SO IT

02:14:25.858 --> 02:14:27.092
REALLY IS UP IN THE AIR RIGHT

02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:28.928
NOW AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

02:14:28.994 --> 02:14:29.862
WITH EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLANS

02:14:29.929 --> 02:14:31.897
AND THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF I

02:14:31.964 --> 02:14:33.265
BELIEVE A HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:14:33.332 --> 02:14:34.433
MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE

02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:35.868
UNITED STATES THAT'S HOW THEY-

02:14:35.935 --> 02:14:37.937
BEGIN THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE-

02:14:38.003 --> 02:14:39.171
SO THAT'S LOOKING AT THINGS

02:14:39.238 --> 02:14:41.173
FROM. THE MICRO PERSPECTIVE

02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:43.342
WITHIN THE WORKPLACE NOW FROM

02:14:43.409 --> 02:14:44.410
THE MACRO PERSPECTIVE LOOKING

02:14:44.476 --> 02:14:46.278
AT THE CALIFORNIA JOB SECTOR IN

02:14:46.345 --> 02:14:47.780
THE JOB SEGMENT ANOTHER HUGE

02:14:47.846 --> 02:14:48.647
QUESTION MARK WHAT'S IT GONNA

02:14:48.714 --> 02:14:50.583
DO THIS THERE'S REPEAL WITHOUT

02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:51.650
FEDERAL DOLLARS ROLLING AND

02:14:51.717 --> 02:14:54.086
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN-

02:14:54.153 --> 02:14:55.654
SEGMENTS OF THE HEALTHCARE

02:14:55.721 --> 02:14:58.190
MARKET. THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE

02:14:58.257 --> 02:14:59.525
YOU'RE LOOKING AT PEOPLE

02:14:59.592 --> 02:15:01.226
NEEDING TO ALLOCATE POSSIBLY

02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:02.394
MORE MONEY TO THEIR HEALTHCARE

02:15:02.461 --> 02:15:03.529
SO MAYBE THEY'RE NOT SPENDING

02:15:03.596 --> 02:15:04.897
IN OTHER PLACES QUITE AS MUCH

02:15:04.964 --> 02:15:07.499
THAT COULD AFFECT THE- BASIC

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:10.302
ECONOMICS OF THE WORKPLACE- LOT

02:15:10.369 --> 02:15:12.638
OF UNKNOWNS RIGHT NOW SO I DO

02:15:12.705 --> 02:15:13.973

FORMAL CARE ACT LOS ANGELES.

02:18:31.904 --> 02:18:35.107
PROBABLY WAS GROUND ZERO. FOR

02:18:35.174 --> 02:18:36.508
HAVING ON THIS THING SUCH A

02:18:36.575 --> 02:18:38.343
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO

CASES THEY'RE COVERED WAS

02:18:50.689 --> 02:18:52.491
RESCINDED AFTER THE FACT WHEN

IT WAS FOUND THAT THEY HAD A

02:18:54.059 --> 02:18:57.029
PRE EXISTING CONDITION- ARE

02:18:57.095 --> 02:18:58.831
THESE BOTH THE THINGS GENERATED

02:18:58.897 --> 02:18:59.932
NATIONAL HEADLINES AND HELP

02:18:59.998 --> 02:19:01.800
PROMPTED THE POINT OF REFORM.

02:19:01.867 --> 02:19:04.236
AND THE SAME WITH OUR PREMIUM

02:19:04.303 --> 02:19:05.771

CREDITED AS ONE OF THE LAST

02:19:15.247 --> 02:19:16.849
THAT WE- ACTUALLY LED TO THE-

02:19:16.915 --> 02:19:17.516

02:19:17.583 --> 02:19:28.927
WE. WE HAVE. THAT EXPERIENCE

02:19:28.994 --> 02:19:29.628
AND I HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE

02:19:29.695 --> 02:19:30.963
HAVING. BEEN IN MY AT ACCESS.

02:19:31.029 --> 02:19:32.631
OR NEARLY TO DEATH NOW. I WOULD

02:19:32.698 --> 02:19:33.832
SAY. I WILL ALSO SAY IN THAT

02:19:33.899 --> 02:19:36.034
EXPERIENCE THAT YOU KNOW WE

02:19:36.101 --> 02:19:37.236
WORK TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:19:37.302 --> 02:19:40.806
ISSUES. POINT BY POINT- OVER-

02:19:40.872 --> 02:19:42.074
OVER THE YEARS PRIOR TO THE

02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:43.408
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND IT WAS

02:19:43.475 --> 02:19:44.810
REALLY HARD WITHOUT THE

02:19:44.877 --> 02:19:46.812
FRAMEWORK IN THE FINANCING. OF

02:19:46.879 --> 02:19:47.813
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:50.415
PROVIDED THROUGH THE ACA- IT'S

02:19:50.482 --> 02:19:52.217
NOT LIKE WE DIDN'T TRY TO-

02:19:52.284 --> 02:19:53.619
PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE

02:19:53.685 --> 02:19:55.220
EXISTING CONDITIONS BUT IT'S

02:19:55.287 --> 02:19:56.188
VERY HARD TO DO THAT WITHOUT

02:19:56.255 --> 02:19:59.424
THAT. MONEY AND LEX IT WOULD

02:19:59.491 --> 02:20:00.659
HAVE HAD FINANCING WITHOUT THE

02:20:00.726 --> 02:20:02.761
FRAMEWORK. AND YOU KNOW SOME OF

02:20:02.828 --> 02:20:03.795

FEDERALLY REGULATED PLANS THAT

02:20:10.569 --> 02:20:11.770
WE CAN'T TOUCH AT THE STATE

02:20:11.837 --> 02:20:12.905
LEVEL EVEN IF WE PROVIDE THOSE

02:20:12.971 --> 02:20:14.873
PROTECTIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL.

02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:16.842
IN OTHER WORDS- BUT IT'S ALSO

02:20:16.909 --> 02:20:18.677
ABOUT THE FINANCING- THE L. A.

02:20:18.744 --> 02:20:21.313

SUBSIDIES AND COVERAGE

02:20:24.583 --> 02:20:26.184
CALIFORNIA ALONE. BUT THE

02:20:26.251 --> 02:20:26.919
LEGISLATORS WHO RUN THIS

02:20:26.985 --> 02:20:29.121
COMMITTEE. EQUIVALENT IF YOU

ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT MONEY IN

02:20:30.622 --> 02:20:32.124
THE STATE BUDGET. YOU WOULD

02:20:32.190 --> 02:20:34.693
HAPPEN- ON UNDO ALL OF THE

COMBINE. IN ORDER TO MAKE UP

02:20:43.902 --> 02:20:45.404
THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF MONEY.

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.373
THAT IT. WAS THAT WE GET

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:49.508

02:20:49.574 --> 02:20:51.810
BETTER HEALTH SYSTEM GETS-

02:20:51.877 --> 02:20:55.147
THROUGH THE ACA. SO YOU KNOW

02:20:55.213 --> 02:20:57.482
WE- CAN WE GO GO IT ALONE IF WE

02:20:57.549 --> 02:20:58.684
IF WE LOSE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE

02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:00.185
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IT WOULD

02:21:00.252 --> 02:21:01.586
BE MORE OF A SALVAGE OPERATION

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:02.821
IT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE

02:21:02.888 --> 02:21:06.825
LIFEBOATS- OF FOR A HANDFUL OF.

02:21:06.892 --> 02:21:08.427

COURT- I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF

02:28:25.764 --> 02:28:27.432
THAT- WELL CERTAINLY I THINK

02:28:27.499 --> 02:28:28.900
WHEN THE AC IS BEING PASSED

02:28:28.967 --> 02:28:31.302
AND- PEOPLE LOOKED AT THE

02:28:31.369 --> 02:28:33.004
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND THE

02:28:33.071 --> 02:28:35.006
PENALTY. THAT THE PROBABLY WERE

02:28:35.073 --> 02:28:36.541
IN A POLICY ANALYST YOU'LL

02:28:36.608 --> 02:28:37.976

02:28:39.878 --> 02:28:41.246
HOW THAT'S TIED TO OTHER

02:28:41.312 --> 02:28:42.480
PORTIONS PARTICULARLY THE

02:28:42.547 --> 02:28:44.749
PROVISIONS RELATED TO PRE

02:28:44.816 --> 02:28:45.950

02:28:53.958 --> 02:28:55.093
BUT I THINK ALSO SINCE WE'VE

02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:58.696
EXPERIENCE- IN THE NATION AFTER

02:28:58.763 --> 02:29:00.231
CONGRESS ESSENTIALLY ZEROED OUT

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:01.299
THE PENALTY THE FACT THAT THE

02:29:01.366 --> 02:29:03.168
AC ITSELF STILL CONTINUES TO

02:29:03.234 --> 02:29:05.236

02:29:13.011 --> 02:29:14.646
THAT IT IS IN TERMS OF LINKING

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:16.247
IT TO ALL THE OTHER PROVISIONS

02:29:16.314 --> 02:29:19.017
HOPEFULLY- THE SUPREME COURT.

02:29:19.083 --> 02:29:20.084
WELL FIRST WHILE THE SUPREME

02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:21.352
COURT RECOGNIZES THAT STATE

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:22.454
THAT THIS IS A THIS IS A

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.022
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND IT SAYS

02:29:24.088 --> 02:29:25.590
SHOULD NOT BE OVERTURNED BUT-

02:29:25.657 --> 02:29:27.859
EVEN IN TERMS OF SEVERABILITY-

02:29:27.926 --> 02:29:29.160
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IF

02:29:29.227 --> 02:29:30.161
THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:29:30.228 --> 02:29:31.996
THAT CERTAINLY. THE EIGHTIES

02:29:32.063 --> 02:29:33.231
BEEN OLD FUNCTION IN THIS

02:29:33.298 --> 02:29:35.200
COUNTRY- EVEN WITH A ZEROED OUT

02:29:35.266 --> 02:29:38.336
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE- AS- BUT

02:29:38.403 --> 02:29:40.705
CONGRESS BUT- THE OTHER THING I

02:29:40.772 --> 02:29:41.339
ALSO WANT TO JUST MAKE AN

02:29:41.406 --> 02:29:42.974
OBSERVATION AND- CERTAINLY

02:29:43.041 --> 02:29:44.609
HEARD FROM OUR CONSUMERS AND TO

02:29:44.676 --> 02:29:45.877
REALLY APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY

02:29:45.944 --> 02:29:47.779
FROM GEORGIA. TERRY OF

02:29:47.846 --> 02:29:49.747
INSURANCE AND CHEN FLORI AND-

02:29:49.814 --> 02:29:51.616
AND ALSO FOR- FROM OTHERS AS

02:29:51.683 --> 02:29:54.052
WELL AS- ACTUALLY WHAT KIND OF

02:29:54.118 --> 02:29:58.623
WHAT THE ACA DOES. IN TERMS OF

02:29:58.690 --> 02:30:00.191
GIVING AMERICANS FREEDOM. ALL

02:30:00.258 --> 02:30:01.826
RIGHT. YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES

02:30:01.893 --> 02:30:02.861
PEOPLE THINK FREEDOM IS

02:30:02.927 --> 02:30:04.729
SOMETHING THAT ONLY PEOPLE OF A

02:30:04.796 --> 02:30:06.498
CERTAIN IDEOLOGY TALK ABOUT

02:30:06.564 --> 02:30:07.332
THAT THIS IS ABOUT THIS IS

02:30:07.398 --> 02:30:09.334
ABOUT FREEDOM. RIGHT TO FREEDOM

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:10.802
FROM FEAR TO FREEDOM OF PEOPLE

02:30:10.869 --> 02:30:11.569
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DIFFERENT

02:30:11.636 --> 02:30:13.137
KIND OF CAREER CHOICES WE HEARD

02:30:13.204 --> 02:30:16.574
ABOUT THAT FROM CONSUMERS. AND

02:30:16.641 --> 02:30:18.910
THAT WILL THE SUPREME COURT

02:30:18.977 --> 02:30:19.611
TAKE THIS FREEDOM AWAY FROM

02:30:19.677 --> 02:30:21.579
AMERICANS. AND I THINK THAT'S

02:30:21.646 --> 02:30:23.114
REALLY THE QUESTION THAT'S

02:30:23.181 --> 02:30:25.183
COMING BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT

02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:25.750

CONGRESS PASSED THE LAW THE

02:30:29.854 --> 02:30:32.223
PRESIDENT SIGNED THE LAW. THAT

02:30:32.290 --> 02:30:34.325
IS GIVEN NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:30:34.392 --> 02:30:37.161
AMERICANS. BY PROVIDING THEM

02:30:37.228 --> 02:30:40.465
HEALTHCARE. AND SO IS THE

02:30:40.532 --> 02:30:46.404
FREEDOM TO BE TAKEN AWAY. AND I

02:30:46.471 --> 02:30:47.572
THINK IN THIS HEARING WE HEARD

02:30:47.639 --> 02:30:49.274
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TEN YEARS AGO

02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:51.042
WE CAN FORGET A LOT OF THINGS.

02:30:51.109 --> 02:30:53.645
OVER A DECADE. BUT WE HEARD

02:30:53.711 --> 02:30:56.080
