DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

A FACT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:29.487
TWENTY THREE BUT THERE ARE FEW

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:30.521

OF THE NEW AGENCY WHICH I'LL

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:33.791

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:37.261
INTO EFFECT UPON VOTER APPROVAL.

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:38.896
THE CHANGES ARE MADE BY THIS

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.631
PROPOSED MEASURE REALLY FALL

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:43.467
INTO FOUR KEY AREA. THE FIRST

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:45.002
IS THAT IT CHANGES EXISTING

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:46.537
CONSUMER DATA PRIVACY LAWS AND

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:49.040
IT DOES SO IN A COUPLE WAYS. IT

00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:51.008
CHANGES BUSINESSES I NEED TO

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:53.878
COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS SO FOR

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.379

FOR HOUSEHOLD ANNUALLY WHEN I

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:09.927
WANT TO COMPLY IN OTHER CASES

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:11.896
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT AT YOUR

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:13.898
BUSINESS MAY NEED TO COME. IT

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:16.467
ALSO EXPANDS EXISTING CONSUMER

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.369
DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS SUCH

00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:19.837

CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES SHARE

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:24.475
DATA. BUT IT ALSO EASES

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:25.476
REQUIREMENTS OF CERTAIN

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:26.978
BUSINESSES- SO CERTAIN

00:37:27.044 --> 00:37:28.412
BUSINESSES WOULD BE ABLE TO NOT

00:37:29.947 --> 00:37:32.083

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:34.285
SO FOR EXAMPLE- BUSINESSES ARE

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:36.320
NOT REQUIRED TO DELETE STUDENT

00:37:36.387 --> 00:37:39.256
GRADES ARE EDUCATIONAL. DATA

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:40.658
THE SECOND MAJOR AREA OF

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:41.859
CHANGES THAT THE PROPOSED

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:43.327
MEASURE WOULD PROVIDE NEW DATA

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:45.730
PRIVACY RIGHTS CONSUMERS WILL

00:37:45.796 --> 00:37:47.365
BE ABLE TO DIRECT BUSINESSES TO

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.934
NOT SHARE THEIR DATA TO CORRECT

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:52.803
DATA AS WELL AS- TO USE THAT

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.238
SENSITIVE DATA SUCH AS SOCIAL

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:57.708
SECURITY NUMBERS- HEALTH DATA

00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:58.809
FOR ONLY THE PURPOSE OF

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:00.211
PROVIDING THE REQUESTED GOOD OR

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:02.880
SERVICE. OR FOURTEEN BUSINESS

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:04.415
REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS CUSTOMER

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:08.185
SERVICE. THE THIRD AREA IS THAT

00:38:08.252 --> 00:38:10.121
THIS PROPOSAL MAKES CHANGES TO

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:12.523
THE EXISTING PENALTY STRUCTURE-

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.826
SO FOR EXAMPLE. VIOLATIONS THE

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:17.461
MEASURE AUTHORIZES- A PENALTY

00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:20.464
OF UP TO SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:21.098
HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR VIOLATIONS

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:23.367
OF MINOR RIGHT. BUT IT ALSO

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:24.902
ELIMINATES THE ABILITY OF

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.570
BUSINESSES TO AVOID PENALTIES

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.639
BY ADDRESSING VIOLATIONS WITHIN

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:32.043
THIRTY DAYS. ARE TURNING FIVE

00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:34.979
OF YOUR HAND OUT IT ALSO LIMITS

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.914
THE USE OF CONSUMER PRIVACY

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.683
REVENUES FOR PURPOSES OTHER

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:41.552
THAN CONSUMER PRIVACY- SO AFTER

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:44.188
COURT COSTS THE STATE DOJ COSTS

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:45.990
ARE TAKING CARE OF THE MEASURE

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:48.225
WOULD THEN REQUIRE 91% OF THE

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:51.629
RATHER BE INVESTED BY THE STATE.

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:52.730
EARNINGS WERE BE TRANSFERRED TO

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:54.165
THE GENERAL FUND FOR IT USED

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:55.833
FOR OTHER PURPOSES. THE

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.935
REMAINING 9% WOULD BE USED TO

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.670
SUPPORT PUBLIC EDUCATION

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.238
RELATED TO CONSUMER PRIVACY AS

00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:04.742
WELL AS TO ADDRESS- FRAUD THAT

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:06.544
RESULTED FROM DATA BREACHES.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.512
THE FOURTH AND FINAL ARIEL WAS

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:09.480
ALREADY REFERENCE BY MISTER

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:11.782
CHAIR- WHICH IS THE NEW MEASURE

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:13.784
CREATES A NEW STATE AGENCY THE

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:14.885
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:17.855
AGENCY TO OVERSEE AND ENFORCE

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:18.789
THE STATE'S CONSUMER PRIVACY

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.958
LAWS. THE NEW AGENCY WOULD HAVE

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.593
A VARIETY OF RESPONSIBILITIES

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.329
RANGING FROM INVESTIGATING AND

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:26.530
IF YOU CAME VIOLATIONS

00:39:26.597 --> 00:39:29.133
ASSESSING PENALTY IS TO

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.935
DEVELOPING REGULATIONS THE

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:33.204
AGENCIES DECISIONS RELATED SIT

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.371
COMPLAINTS AGAINST BUSINESSES

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:36.040
ARE ASSESSMENTS OF PENALTIES.

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:38.442
WOULD BE- ELIGIBLE FOR REVIEW

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:40.678
BY THE TRIAL COURT. SOME OF THE

00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:41.812
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE NEW

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.581
AGENCY IT WOULD HAVE WOULD BE

00:39:43.647 --> 00:39:46.484
SHIFTED FROM DOJ MOST NOTABLY

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.486
THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS.

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.755
HOWEVER DOJ WOULD STILL BE ABLE

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:52.389
TO PROSECUTE CRIMES AND FILE

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:54.492
LAWSUITS AND TRIAL COURTS AND

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:55.726
MOST NOTABLY THIS MEASURE

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:57.394
SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT DOJ'S

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:59.029
INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT

00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:02.333
ACTIVITIES WHAT HAVE PRIORITY

00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:04.902
OVER THAT OF THE AGENCY.

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:06.470
TURNING TO THE FINAL PAGE OF

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:08.305
YOUR HAND OUT WE'LL TURN OUR

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:10.508
ATTENTION TO THE FISCAL A FAX.

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:11.442
THIS MEASURE WILL HAVE AN

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.210
IMPACT ON THE STATE COSTS AS

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:15.045
WELL AS POTENTIALLY ON STATE

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.747
AND LOCAL TAX REVENUES. THE

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.849
ACTUAL SIZE OF THE IMPACT WILL

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:21.519
REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW CONSUMERS

00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:23.821
BUSINESSES AND STATE ND LOCAL

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:26.023
GOVERNMENTS RESPOND TO THE

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.391
MEASURE AND SO IT IS A BIT AND

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:29.393
CERTAIN SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.728
UNCLEAR HOW BUSINESSES WILL

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:32.396
CHANGE THEIR OPERATIONS TO

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:33.430
COMPLY WITH FULL OF THE

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.099
PROPOSED MEASURE. AS WELL AS A

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:37.535
NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS THAT WILL

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:40.437
BE ASSESSED AND INVESTIGATED

00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:41.806
AND EDUCATE. SO WITH THAT IN

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.908
MIND WE IDENTIFIED THREE. FAX

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:46.076
THE FIRST IS INCREASED STATE

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:47.845
COSTS FOR THE NEW AGENCY. THE

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.046
MEASURE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.748
THAT AT LEAST TEN MILLION

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:52.116
DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:53.551
BE PROVIDED ANNUALLY IS TO

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.885
SUPPORT THE AGENCY'S

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.454
OPERATIONS. DEPENDING ON HOW

00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:58.756
THE AGENCY CARE OUT ITS

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:00.090
RESPONSIBILITIES. THE ACTUAL

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:02.059
COST COULD POTENTIALLY BE

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:04.428
HIGHER. THE SECOND EFFECT IS

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:06.163
INCREASED STATE DOJ A COURT

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.166
COSTS- DOJ WORKLOAD COULD

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:11.335
INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:13.704
CHOOSES TO INVESTIGATE AND FILE

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:15.873
MORE CASES. SOME OF THIS

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.174
INCREASE WORK WHAT LOAD WOULD

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:19.476
BE OFFSET- EITHER PARTIALLY OR

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:20.978
FULLY BY THE SHIFT AND

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:23.247
RESPONSIBILITIES FROM DOJ- TO

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.149
THE NEW AGENCY. IN A SIMILAR

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:27.218
WAY COURT WORKLOAD COULD

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:30.054
INCREASE IF MORE CASES ARE

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.089
FILED IN COURT. THE COSTS OF

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:33.858
THE INCREASED WORKLOAD WOULD

00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:34.959
DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:36.861
INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:38.696
INITIATED AS WELL AS THE TYPES

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:40.164
OF CASES THAT ARE FILED IN THE

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:43.300
QUIRK. IN TOTAL THE STATE COSTS

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:44.702
ARE NOT LIKELY TO EXCEED THE

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:47.004
LOW MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:48.906
ANNUALLY SOME OR ALL OF THESE

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:50.808
COSTS WOULD BE OFFSET BY THE

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:52.509
INCREASED REVENUES- FROM

00:41:52.576 --> 00:41:53.811
HANDLES HE'S- TEST ON

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:56.447
BUSINESSES THAT VIOLATE THE LAW.

00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:58.349
THE FINAL AFFECT IS RELATED TO

00:41:58.415 --> 00:41:59.750
TAX REVENUES IN THE POTENTIAL

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:01.819
IMPACT OF THEIR- AND SO ON THE

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.821
ONE HAND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:06.090
TAX REVENUES COULD DECREASE. SO

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.625
FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE COMPLIANCE

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:09.093
COSTS THAT REDUCE BUSINESS

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:10.995
PROFITS THAT COULD RESULT IN A

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:13.030
REDUCTION IN TAX REVENUES.

00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:15.399
HOWEVER ON THE OTHER HAND- TAX

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:17.034
REVENUES COULD INCREASE SO FOR

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:19.270
EXAMPLE IF BUSINESSES AND

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:21.505
CONSUMERS LOSE LAST MONEY FROM

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.407
LESS SEVERE OR FEWER DATA

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:25.042
BREACHES. IT COULD RESULT IN

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:27.177
CONSUMERS SPENDING MORE ON

00:42:27.244 --> 00:42:29.446
TAXABLE GOODS OR BUSINESSES

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:31.015
EARNING WATER AND THAT WOULD

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:33.183
HAVE AN IMPACT TAX REVENUE. THE

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.653
TOTAL THAT PACKED HOWEVER IS-

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.988
UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME. SO WITH

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.790
THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR COMMENTS

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:41.091
WE WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:43.127

PURPOSES. THANK YOU MISTER

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:59.695
CHAIR THAT- I I'M GONNA DO MY

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.230
BEST TO ANSWER THAT FOR YOU CAN

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:03.232
TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT- I DO

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:06.368
SO- FIRST IN TERMS OF THINKING

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:08.370
ABOUT THE MONIES THAT ARE GOING

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:10.673
INTO THE CONSUMER PRIVACY FINE-

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.741
BUT YOU HAVE ENFORCEMENT

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:15.544
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ABLE TO GO

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:17.980
INTO A FAX RELATED TO THAT THE

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:21.850
CPPA. ALWAYS STARTING SHORTLY-

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.152
ENFORCEMENT RELATED TO THESE

01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:24.954
NEW REQUIREMENTS KICK AND A

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.391
LITTLE BIT LATER- AND SO IF THE

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:31.060
TIMING IS A LITTLE BIT OF

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:32.628
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:34.129
BECAUSE WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:35.598
BUDGET PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.199
IS WEIGHING CONCERNS RELATED TO

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.300
THE ECONOMY AS WELL AS

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:41.170
ADDRESSING COPE IN NINETEEN-

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:42.338
AND SO I'M THINKING ABOUT KIND

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:43.639
OF THAT PENALTY REVENUE THERE'S

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.474
ALREADY A LITTLE GOING TO BE A

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:47.076
LITTLE BIT OF A LACK- I THINK

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.911
THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE FIRST

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.879
USE OF THE MONEY AS FOR STATE

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:53.115
COURT AND DOJ COSTS. AND SO I

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:55.451
THINK THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:57.519
AS WELL AS THIS YOU PROPOSAL

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.455
THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS KIND OF ON

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.590
ENFORCEMENT THERE MAYBE

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.359
INTERPRETATIONS FOR HOW MUCH

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:06.695
ENFORCEMENT S NEEDED AND SO IN

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:11.367
THE IN THE- LAND IS UNDER THE

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:12.434
LEGISLATURE'S PURVIEW. I IF

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:14.003
THEY THINK MORE MONEY IS

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:15.871
NECESSARY OR NEED IT.

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:16.839
LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY CAN

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:19.808
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MONEY BUT IT

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:21.143
DOES BECOME A TRADE OFF

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.511
DISCUSSION FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.046
GIVEN OTHER GENERAL FUND

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.148
PRIORITY AND SO THAT CAN

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.549
INCLUDE THINGS COMPLETELY

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:30.085
OUTSIDE EDUCATION- EXCEPT OUR

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:34.023
HEALTH CARE IT ON THOSE AREAS.

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:36.091
SIMILARLY YOU KNOW IF. THE

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:37.259
LEGISLATURE THINGS THAT MORE

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.427
MONEY SHOULD BE DEDICATED TO

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:39.361
THE END OF THIS AREA SO FOR

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:41.296
EXAMPLE IF THERE IS A CONCERNED

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:44.166
WITH- EDUCATING INDIVIDUALS

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:45.434
LIKE CENTER AT HELPING OUT

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:46.568
BUSINESSES THAT'S ANOTHER

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.737
PRIORITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.506
CAN PUT INTO PLACE BUT I THINK

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:51.407
THE KEY THING THAT I WANT TO

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.409
KIND OF HIGHLIGHT IS. RELATED

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:56.078
TO THE NINETY ONE PERCENT-

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.247
INVESTMENT OF DOLLARS AS WELL

01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:00.416
AS THAN THAT BUT 9% GOING TO

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:03.452
FIND- EDUCATION ETCETERA THAT

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:04.453
IS GOING TO KIND OF TAKE A

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.388
FACT. A LITTLE BIT LATER IN

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:07.823
TERMS OF LIKE WE NEED TO SEE

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.058
THE REVENUE AND THEN IT WOULD

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.359
ONLY NEED TO GET OUT SO THAT'S

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.260
NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:12.361
YOU WOULD BE DEALING WITH

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:13.829
IMMEDIATELY I DON'T KNOW IF

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.764
HOPE. THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.332
VERY MUCH- I HAVE SEVERAL

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:19.134
QUESTIONS FOR MR MCTAGGART BUT

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:20.569
DAHLE IMAGES ALTERNATE MAYBE

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:21.170
I'LL START OFF WITH THE FIRST

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.805
QUESTION AND AN OPEN- FOR MY

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:23.672
COLLEAGUES OF FOR THE

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.340
QUESTIONS- I THINK THE FIRST

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:28.043
QUESTION DEALS WITH THE- AND

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.311
EVERY THAT YOU STARTED TO TOUCH

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:30.813
ON AND I WANT TO ELABORATE ON

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:31.980
THAT QUESTION A LITTLE BIT AND

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:34.550
IF YOU COULD. OF YOU KNOW DO A

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:36.785
LITTLE DEEPER DIVE OFF OF FOR

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:37.986
THE FOR THE ANSWER SO THE

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:39.922
QUESTION IS WHY IS NOW THE TIME

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:42.291
TO DISPEL INITIATIVE WHICH IS

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:44.159
SOMETHING THAT YOU TRY TO ARGUE

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:47.262
ANSWER. ON WHICH OVERWRITES THE

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:49.798
CCPA WHEN WE HAVE JUST BEGUN

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:53.535
IMPLEMENTING CC YEAH I WOULD BE

01:12:53.602 --> 01:13:00.042
BETTER TO BUILD UPON THE CCPA.

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:03.212
IN BUSINESS. WHAT TO. AXIS

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:05.080
THEIR RIGHTS UNDER SIEGE SO IT

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:07.015
I KNOW IT'S A LOT QUESTION. SO

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:07.983
WHY IS NOW THE TIME TO RUN

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.219
ABOUT IT. WE IS ESSENTIALLY

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:11.553
OVER RIGHTS TO SOME X. THE CCPA

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.088
WHEN WE HOW JUST BEGUN

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.758
IMPLEMENTING THE CCPA. SECOND

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:17.793
PART OF THE QUESTION. WOULDN'T

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.395
IT BE BETTER TO BUILD UPON THE

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:23.165
CCPA. AFTER CONSUMER AFTER

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.167
CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.002
MORE TIME TO EXERCISE THEIR

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:30.239
RIGHTS UNDER THIS HE'S. WELL

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:32.040
AGAIN AS I AS I AS I AS I TRIED

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:35.144
TO- ELABORATE EARLIER- MY

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.845
PROFOUND CONVICTION IS THIS IS

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.947
NOT OVER WRITING CCP THIS IS

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:41.683
BUILDING ON THE CPA SO THIS IS

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.619
THIS IS ENHANCING CCPA. A BEAR

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:45.487
IN MIND THERE'S A LONG RUNWAY

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:47.256
HERE THAT THIS- ENFORCEMENT FOR

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:49.024
THIS ACT IF IT PASSES WOULD

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:51.093
START IN THE MIDDLE OF TWENTY

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.227
TWENTY THREE JULY TWENTY TWENTY

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.263
THREE SO LET ME LOTS OF TIME

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:55.931
FOR THE CPA TO BE IN EFFECT.

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:59.334
AND I'D- AGAIN ALSO BUILDING ON

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:01.770
THE FACT REMINDING- THE FACT

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:02.971
THAT THE LEGISLATURE STILL WILL

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:05.774
HAVE TOTAL FLEXIBILITY. TO DEAL

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:08.043
WITH. ANY CHANGES THAT WANTS TO

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:11.446
MAKE. IN IN THE COMING YEARS-

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:13.248
IT'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS STOPS

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:14.583
LEGISLATURE FROM MAKING ANY

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:17.052
CHANGES. IT JUST MERELY AGAIN

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.388
CONCEPT FLOOR THRESHOLD IN SO I

01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:21.557
THINK THAT IT THIS IS A IS. A

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.425
CREATIVE. THIS THIS THIS BUILT

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:25.794
ON AND I THINK- AT FOR THE TO

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:26.895
THE REASONS I SAID EARLIER.

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:29.231
COULD IN THE NATIONAL ONE-

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.833
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT- IT PUT

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:33.202
FLOOR FOR CALIFORNIA THINK

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:34.369

THE CLOCK WORK. TO DO THE

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:19.948
EXTRAORDINARY- EFFORT THAT WE

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:21.783
WROTE TO AND WAS A TWO THOUSAND

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.352

WERE TRYING TO GET- MYSTERY TAG

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:37.099
WHICH MEASURE OFF THE BALLOT I

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:38.433
HAD WORKED FOR MANY YEARS

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.702
PREVIOUSLY ON ON REFORMING THE

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.771
INITIATIVE PROCESS STARTING IN

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:44.006
TWO THOUSAND SPEAKERS.

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:46.074
COMMISSION INITIATIVE REFORM TO

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:48.744
TRY TO CREATE SOME MORE

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:49.845
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.046
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:52.915
GOVERNMENT AND PROPONENTS AND

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:54.950
THIS WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT AND

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.118
WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:58.854
OF HOURS. WITH MR MCTAGGART AND

01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:02.424
OTHERS- IN EFFORT TO COME UP

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.192
WITH SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT.

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:06.695
WOULD WORK REASONABLY WELL. BUT

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:09.631
THIS AREA PRIVACY IS INFORMED

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:13.602
IN A DIFFERENT WAY BY ISSUES

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.070
THAT WE DON'T NORMALLY SEE IN

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:17.439
THE LEGISLATURE FIRST HIT IS

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:20.042
SUCH A FAST MOVING- TECHNOLOGY

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:23.545
INFORMED. AREA OF THE LAW THAT

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:24.446
SOME OF THESE THINGS WOULD EVEN

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:25.614
KNOW THAT HAPPENED WHO KNEW

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:27.049
ABOUT COUNT STEPS ARE HEART

01:16:27.115 --> 01:16:29.451
BEATS OUR GEO LOCATION OR ALL

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:32.020
THOSE THINGS. SO THAT BECOMES

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:34.523
QUITE CHALLENGING SECONDLY.

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:35.691
WHERE THERE MIGHT OFTEN BE A

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:36.992
FIGHT BETWEEN LABOR AND

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:38.493
BUSINESS OR CERTAIN MEDICAL

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.530
INTERESTS OR DOCTORS OR LAWYERS

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:42.297
THIS WAS QUITE CHALLENGING

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:44.800
BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:47.235
DIFFERENT COMPANIES HAVE USED

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:50.672
DIFFERENT ECONOMIC MODELS.

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:53.342
TRYING DEVELOP THEIR BUSINESS.

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.010
WE FOUND IN THESE DISCUSSIONS

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.878
WHERE WE'RE COMPANY A SOUGHT IT

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:59.081
WAS A GOOD IDEA COMPANY BE LONG

01:16:59.147 --> 01:16:59.982
COMES ALONG AND THEY WANT TO

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:00.916
KILL IT BECAUSE IT WAS

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:02.284
INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:03.785
BUSINESS MODEL. IT WAS QUITE A

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:06.788
CHALLENGE AND SO THE EFFECT OF

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:09.558
WAS AND IS YOU KNOW THIS MISTER-CHAIRMAN I YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:10.692
SAID THIS SO I APOLOGIZE FOR

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.561
THAT BUT IN OUR EFFORT UNDER

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:14.796
YOUR MEASURE. THE IDEA WAS THAT

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:20.068
WE WOULD ARE. BY THE BILL. GET

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:20.669
MISTER MIKE TAGGERT MAY A THE

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:21.470
BALLOT AND WE DELAYED

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:24.139
IMPLEMENTATION FOR A YEAR. AND

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:25.640
THE REASON WE DID IMPLICATION

01:17:25.707 --> 01:17:27.876
FOR YEARS THAT WE DIDN'T FEEL.

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:29.344
IN THE HONOR OF THE LEGISLATIVE

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:31.113
PROCESS THAT WE HAVE HAD THE

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:32.948
TIME WE HAD OUR BRIEF HEARINGS

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:34.716
THAT YOU WERE PRESENT THAT. TO

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:36.485
REALLY ENGAGE IN KIND OF SCREW.

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:38.153
BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY WELL NO

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.788
NO ONE BELIEVE WE CAN GET OFF

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:40.522
THE BALLOT DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.224
POSSIBLE. PEOPLE KIND OF FUN

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.059
THEIR NOSE AT US IN IN KIND OF

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:47.195
QUITE FRANKLY. AND NO ONE

01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:48.663
THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE. SO IF

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:49.965
YOU REMEMBER WE GAVE THEM A

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:52.901
DOOR A AMADOR VIA. OPTIONS AND

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:54.469
THEY SELECTED THE ONE THE

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:56.405
MEASURE THAT WAS THE CPA. BUT

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:58.473
THE BY MY HOPE WAS THAT WE

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.308
WOULD ENGAGE IN A VERY ROBUST

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:03.145
DEBATE. IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:04.146
TO BE ABLE TO SCRUB THE

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:06.782
LEGISLATION WE KNEW GOING IN

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:07.349
THAT THERE WERE MISTAKES TAT

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:09.718
WE MADE. AND EFFECTS AT. FACT

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:12.120
OF THE MATTER WAS NOT MUCH

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:16.124
HAPPENED WHY IS A RELEVANT BUT

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:17.926
IT IT'S JUST NOT MUCH HAPPENED.

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:20.796
AND THE QUESTION THEN BECAME

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.264
YOU KNOW I FELT QUITE FRANKLY

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:23.331
THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:25.534
OFFICE WITH APPRECIATE THIS THE

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.035
OF TORTILLA THAT WAS GIVEN TO

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:29.438
THEM SHE CPA. AND CREATED SOME

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:31.173
CHALLENGES JUST JUST PUT IT

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:33.442
THERE AND SO WE WERE LOOKING AT

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.010
OPTIONS AND WE WERE TRYING TO

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:37.379
EXPLORE AN OPTION TO TRADE

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:40.615
AGENCY. THAT COULD BASICALLY DO

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:41.083
THIS LIKE THE FEDERAL

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:42.617
GOVERNMENT LIKE THE YOU KNOW

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:45.921
THE F. T. I MEAN THE ELECTIONS

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:48.190
YEAH TRADE COMMISSION ALWAYS OF

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:48.790
THE COMMISSION TO THE FEDERAL

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:49.691
GOVERNMENT WE CAN WITH THE

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:51.393
ELEGANT WAY. THAT WILL WAITED

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.895
FAVOR OF BUSINESSES THAT WITH

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:58.100
INDUSTRY HEAVY BUT JUST TO AWAY.

01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.868
IT WAS A CONCERT OF ALL OF THAT.

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:00.469
ON WHAT WAS CLEAR WAS WE JUST

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:01.837
COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE. WAS

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:03.972
FURTHER CLEAR WAS THAT- IN A

01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:06.875
LARGER DYNAMIC THAT THIS ISSUE

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:09.544
OF PRIVACY WAS BECOMING BIGGER

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:10.112
AND BIGGER. BIGGER PRIVACY

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:12.514
RIGHTS GROUP. YOU KNOW PERSONAL

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.150
DATA AS IT IS A SENSITIVE

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:15.951
PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:17.486
WASN'T REALLY COVERED. IT WAS

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:18.720
BECOMING A BIGGER AND BIGGER

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:20.856
ISSUE IS COMPANIES WERE ENGAGED

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:24.326
IN BEHAVIOR THAT QUITE FRANKLY.

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:24.926
AS I'VE SAID SO MANY TIMES WAS

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:27.028
CREEPY. AND ON THE OTHER SAYS

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:28.530
WE NEED DEEPER PRINT SUMMER

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.565
PROTECTIONS ON THE OTHER HAND

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:32.501
WE HAD THESE HORRIBLE.

01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:35.770
CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:37.506
ALL OF THESE VARIOUS BUSINESS

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:38.940
MODELS THAT WERE HAPPENING AND

01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:40.675
EVERYBODY WAS GOING CRAZY.

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.077
SENATOR DODD WAS INVOLVED IN

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:45.547
THIS HE WAS OF A PRINCIPLE-

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.682
JOIN AUTHOR AND ALL THIS STUFF.

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:48.984
THE OTHER THE OTHER WORK ON

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.952
SERVICES WERE FINISHED HERE BUT

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:53.588
THE POINT IS. THAT WE MET WE

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:55.323
WERE WE WERE FACED WITH A VERY

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.092
DIFFICULT ETHICAL DECISION. DO

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:58.860
WE LET THIS THING CONTINUE TO

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:00.695
GO FORWARD IN IN IN THE

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:01.663
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT SAID

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:02.631
WHERE THEY WERE CLEARLY MORE

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.499
PROTECTIONS THAT WERE NEEDED

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:05.634
CLEARLY CHANGE THAT NEED TO BE

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:08.069
MADE. ORDER WE GO BACK TO THE

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.938
BALLOT. I DON'T KNOW IF HE SAID

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:11.640
THIS YEAR INTRODUCTION BUT DO

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:12.707
WE GO BACK TO THE BALLOT. AND

01:20:12.774 --> 01:20:14.009
THE DECISION WAS MADE I THINK

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:16.378
THE RIGHT DECISION. AND I AND

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:18.046
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:20.382
WERE SPENT BY NUMBER OF US FOR

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.951
MONTHS. GOING THROUGH THIS AND

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:24.853
THE ADVANTAGE WE HAD WAS WE

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.654
PRETTY MUCH KNEW WHAT THE

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.189
PROBLEMS WERE UNDER C. C. P. A

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:29.791
NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO ALL

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:30.892
OF US THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.327
IN THIS BOTH ON THE PRIVACY

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.162
COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY. AND

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:35.397
THOSE OF US INVOLVED IN THE

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:36.498
SENATE SENATOR DODD CENTER

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.166
JACKSON. HAD HUNDREDS AND

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.801
HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF COMMENTS

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:41.436
FROM GROUPS ALL ACROSS THE

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.772
POLITICAL SPECTRUM. OF IDEAS

01:20:43.838 --> 01:20:46.308
THAT THEY HAD SO UNLIKE- WHAT

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:48.109
WE SAW BEFORE WHERE SOMEBODY

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.611
COMES IN WHO'S- GOT THE

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:50.979
RESOURCES TO WRITE BUT

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:52.581
SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT. THIS

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:54.783
WAS TWO YEARS OF A YEAR AND A

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:56.318
HALF OF JUST EXTRAORDINARY

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:58.453
AMOUNT OF COMMENTS FROM PEOPLE.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.321
WHERE WE COULD UNDERSTAND WHERE

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:00.689
PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM AND SO

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:03.158
THE PROCESS WAS- WE CAME UP

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:06.428
WITH THIS. AND I GOTTA TELL YOU

01:21:06.494 --> 01:21:07.562
I MEAN I IT'S THE HARDEST THING

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:10.665
IN THE YEAR THAT I'VE BEEN A-

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:12.000
WORKED ON. AND I THINK THIS.

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:13.335
ARE THE MOST ELEGANT. I THINK

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:15.070
THAT THERE'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:16.871
COMPROMISES BUT IN THE END OF

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:20.008
THE DAY THE- THE- THE IMPACTS

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:22.777
ON THE- A PROTECTING CONSUMERS

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.579
ARE MORE EXPANSIVE. THE

01:21:24.646 --> 01:21:27.816
SOPHISTICATION OF MORE DETAILS.

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:30.518
ARM AND MANY OF THE MISTAKES

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:31.586
THAT WE HAD MADE AND WE MADE

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:32.887
THAT MUCH YOU JUST CAN'T WRITE

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:34.189
A BILLS COMPLICATED WITHOUT

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:36.891
MAKING MISTAKES- WERE SCRUBBED.

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:38.927
SO I GOT TO TELL YOU I JUST

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:40.929

ISSUES AS WELL IN A PRETTY DEEP

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:58.246
WAY. WAS WHAT WAS UNIQUE HERE.

01:21:58.313 --> 01:21:59.914
WAS OFTEN SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:01.116
RESOURCES COMES AND PUT

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:03.551
SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT. AND

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.253
PUT IT BEFORE THE VOTERS WHICH

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.388
YOU HAD HERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.089
SPENT THOUSANDS OF HOURS

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:09.124
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:11.793
AFTER- THE INITIATIVE BUT

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.862
WORKING HIRING MORE EXPERTS THE

WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.501
WASHINGTON DC AND NEW YORK AND

AND SO THIS WASN'T JUST

01:22:25.307 --> 01:22:26.441
SOMETHING THAT WAS DROPPED ON

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.143
FOLKS BUT THAT WAS LITERALLY

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:29.811

REASONABLE WAY- AND I THINK

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:49.531
THAT THE- BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:52.100
ALWAYS BEEN CONSUMER FACING IT

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:53.601

BECAUSE THIS. AT THIS THIS THIS

01:29:49.417 --> 01:29:50.518
WOULD BE. I EVEN STRONGER THE

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:51.652
CPA. I THINK. AGAIN ALL THE

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:52.587
REASONS I WENT THROUGH I WOULD.

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:53.654
I WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL TO

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:04.232
CONSUMER PROTECTION THIS. IS

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:06.234
THAT YOU'RE TAKING YOU THINKTHIS ACTUALLY STRENGTHENED HIS

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.902
ANY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT

01:30:07.969 --> 01:30:08.369
ARE WEAKENED WITH THIS

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:10.371
INITIATIVE. WHAT I DISCUSSED I

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:11.973
THINK IT I THINK IS VASTLY

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:13.574
MOVED THE BALLFORWARD ON A

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:15.643
WHOLE BUNCH AREAS I THINK THAT

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.078
THERE IS. AND I AND I THINK

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:19.213
THERE'S CONFUSION AROUND THAT

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.848
ONE THE SECOND OPTION WE'VE

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:21.449
CREATED WITH THE DO NOT CALL

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:24.485
VERSUS WHERE NOW A COMPANY-

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:25.987
STILL HAS RESPECT OR DO NOT

01:30:26.053 --> 01:30:28.990
SELL OPTION BUT- CHOICE IT

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:29.924

01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:32.426
HOWEVER OFTEN CAN'T CHARGE YOU.

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:34.495
CAN DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU I

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.130
THINK THAT THAT WAS I THINK

01:30:36.197 --> 01:30:38.966
WE'RE THE WORLD'S GONNA GO. I

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:39.867
THINK THE ONLY ONE PEOPLE. WANT

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.636
TO AND SAY. WELL WHY DO YOU DO

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:42.570
THIS IS THAT SELECT. OF

01:30:42.637 --> 01:30:45.406
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. THAT CHANGE.

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:46.974
AND AGAIN AS I SAID WE FOR

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.776
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSORS

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:51.045
TELL ME SOMETHING. I GOT A LIST

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.413
OF THAT THEY WERE UNANIMOUS AND

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.581
THEY ALSO DO NEED TO CHANGE

01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:55.216
THIS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE.

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:57.718
A AN EXEMPTION FOR WHEN

01:30:57.785 --> 01:31:00.955
HERTZBERG HANDS OUT- BUT THE

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:02.690
STORY OF HIS TRIP TO CHINA ANY

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:04.759
PASSES IT OUT. OF THAT'S NOT

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:06.327
PERCENT RATIO ANYMORE AND WE

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:08.129
DID WE DON'T HAVE A RIGHT NOW

01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:10.097
TO SKIP SO I'M- I'LL TAKE THE

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:11.432
HEAT FOR THAT ONE BUT AND FOR

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:16.270
ME I. MIGHT MY OLD. LAST FIND

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:16.904
THE BEST MINDS I COULD. LIST TO

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:18.873
THEM. TAKE EXPERT ADVICE. AND

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:19.574
YOU'RE TRYING TO LISTEN TO BE

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.576
MORE TRANSLATE SOMETHING. AND

THEIR THAN I DON'T PAY THEM

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.546
THEY WERE JUST- PEOPLE WHO

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:26.714
VOLUNTEERED YOU KNOW IN MANY

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:28.015
CASES TENS OR HUNDREDS OF HOURS

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:31.085
TO. REVIEW THIS AND THEY WERE-

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:32.520
CONSISTENT CONSIST ABOUT IT BUT

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:35.356
NO LET ME BE CLEAR. THIS LAW

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:36.991
WOULD DRAMATICALLY STRENGTHEN

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:39.160
CONSUMER PRIVACY CALIFORNIA. IT

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:40.928
WOULD TAKE IT OUT OF THE REACH

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:43.931
OF BEING. HURT BY A FUTURE

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:46.534
LEGISLATURE THAT WANTED TO. IT

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:48.870
WOULD SET A STRONG MESSAGE NASH.

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:50.004
I THINK THIS WOULD. KLAY BUT-

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:52.373
I'M JUST BLOCK. ACTIVE IN THE-

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.842

REGULATING THIS WE WILL

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:03.818
SUDDENLY BECOME I THINK THE

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:05.286
MOST IMPORTANT PRIVACY PLAYER.

WITH AND FOR HER TO PROTECT THE

01:32:29.243 --> 01:32:30.811
PRIVACY. OTHERWISE IT WOULD

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:32.079
REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL THE

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:33.981
QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:35.650

01:32:57.171 --> 01:32:58.606
QUESTOR AND SO LET ME START BY

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.174
A HERE'S THE HERE'S ONE OF THE

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:01.275
I THINK IT REALLY IMPORTANT

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:03.377
PHRASES FROM THAT SECTION. THAT

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:04.478
CONSUMER PRIVACY IN THE

01:33:04.545 --> 01:33:05.413
DEVELOPMENT OF BENEFICIAL NEW

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:07.081
PRODUCTS AND SERVICE ARE NOT

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:09.283
NECESSARILY INCOMPATIBLE GOALS.

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:11.319
PROVIDED AMENDMENTS DON'T

01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:12.620
COMPROMISE OR WE CAN CONSIDER

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:15.056

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:16.290
LINE AND YOU HAVE TO SERICE

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:27.902
AND MY ANSWER THAT IS. LOOKING

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:30.604
IT'S- A LOT BETTER THAN NOTHING

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:31.305
WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW THE

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:32.740
GREAT OTHER NO PROTECTIONS AND

01:33:32.807 --> 01:33:34.942
SO FUTURE LEGISLATURE TO COME

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:35.810
IN WITHOUT YOU. MEMBERS HERE

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:37.445

CHANGE ALL OF THE STRIP IT OUT

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.482
PUT IT OUT OF EXISTENCE. MY

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:42.416
UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT HAPPENS

01:33:42.483 --> 01:33:44.418
IS THAT THE- WHEN MEMBERS

PERFORM A KIND OF A- HIGH LEVEL

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.594
ANALYSIS AND THEY'LL- I THINK

01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:56.364
IT WILL BE QUITE. QUICKLY

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.931
PRETTY SIMPLE AS TO WHETHER

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:58.132
SOMETHING IS OR IS NOT YOU KNOW

01:33:58.199 --> 01:33:59.667
COULD HURT CONSUMER PRIVACY.

01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:01.202
YES AT THE END OF THE DAY IF.

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:02.737
WERE IN SHE WOULD END UP THE

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:06.407
COURT BUT- AGAIN THAT'S NOT THE

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:07.308
WORLD IT'S A LOT BETTER

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:11.846
CONSTRUCT. VAN PROTECTION.

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:14.982
SOMETHING MISTER. IN THIS THIS

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.917
IN THIS INITIATIVE AND

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:17.385
BASICALLY ALMOST EVERY

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:20.054
INITIATIVE. YOU KNOW IN THE

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:21.489
STEM CELL THEY'VE GOT A SUPER

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:23.557
MAJORITY TO MAKE CHANGES IF YOU

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:24.725
LOOK TO THE HISTORY OF ALL

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:26.460
THESE INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN PUT

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:28.629
ON THE BALLOT. AND LITIGATION

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:30.231
IF YOU KNOW THAT HAVE BEEN

01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:31.532
DEALING WITH THIS WHOLE CONCEPT

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:34.001
OF IN FURTHERANCE OF IS ALWAYS

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:36.070
CHALLENGING IT'S ALWAYS

01:34:36.137 --> 01:34:38.339
CHALLENGING AND- IF YOU GO ON

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:39.607
PERHAPS THE STATUTORY AS

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:41.308
OPPOSED TO A CONSTITUTIONAL

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:42.877
INITIATIVE I THINK YOU KNOW.

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:44.145
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:46.180
ISSUE THERE SO IF YOU DON'T PUT

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:47.381
IN FURTHERANCE LANGUAGE IT'S

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:48.749
PROBLEMATIC OF THE BUSINESS

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:50.117
COMMUNITY'S WANTED TO HAVE TWO

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:51.185
THIRDS VOTE BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:53.087
WORRIED ABOUT. THE LEGISLATURE

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:56.190
PASSING A- OF A PRIVATE RIGHT

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:57.758
OF ACTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW WAS

01:34:57.825 --> 01:34:58.959
A BIG QUESTION IT WAS A BIG

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:01.028
QUESTION THAT LETTER. AND HE

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:02.663
DECIDED NOT TO DO WHAT I WAS

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:04.865
FAVOR BUT EITHER THAT WAS THE

01:35:04.932 --> 01:35:05.433
ONLY REASON WE GOT A PRIVACY

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:08.002
DEAL BECAUSE OF. THE REASON IT

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:09.870
WAS WRONG. TO THIS INSTITUTION

01:35:09.937 --> 01:35:12.139
IT EVERY BONE IN MY BODY TO

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:13.808
MAKE A DEAL AND THEN. BEFORE

01:35:13.874 --> 01:35:15.242
THE INK IS DRY TO THEN GO AND

01:35:15.309 --> 01:35:17.178
GO BACK ON THE DEAL. BUT

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:18.412
CERTAINLY THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:20.047
LITIGATED CERTAINLY I SUSPECT

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:21.415
FUTURE LEGISLATURE WILL DO THAT

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:22.917
AND THAT WILL BE LITIGATED AND

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:24.752
THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE. BUT IT

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:26.587
BUT- PROBABLY IN TERMS OF

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:29.290
NEGOTIATION THE MOST. ELEMENTS

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:31.659
HERE BECAUSE- HOW DO YOU DEAL

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:33.194
WITH THE VACATION. HOW TO DEAL

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.528
WITH ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES.

01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:35.830
AND I PROBABLY OF ALL THE

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.431
THINGS THAT WE WORKED ON THIS

01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:38.666
IN FURTHERANCE LANGUAGE IF YOU

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:39.900

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:42.269
SEE OR SOMETHING PAGE THREE.

01:35:42.336 --> 01:35:43.370
MEMBERS CORRECT. THAT LAST

01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:46.774
WHICH IS VERY VERY VERY

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:49.610
SENSITIVE AND- REALLY TRYING

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:52.379
TO. HELLO THE WAY THAT WE DO.

01:35:52.446 --> 01:35:54.181
ALL OF PRIVACY ON THE ONE HAND.

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:56.150
YET DON'T MAKE THE ENTIRE ISSUE

01:35:56.217 --> 01:35:57.618
THE INITIATIVE MEANINGLESS SO

01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:58.752
THAT NEXT YEAR THE LEGISLATURE

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:00.254
COMES O AND JUST TOTALLY FLIPS

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:01.789
IT. BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH

01:36:01.856 --> 01:36:04.658
ARCHITECTURE IN THIS. AND

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:05.793
TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK SO. I

DECADES. ARM THAT THAT'S ALWAYS

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.338

FIRST TIME WE GET IMPORTANT

BASELINE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS.

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:06.547
THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:07.181
IN LIGHT OF FEDERAL IN ACTION.

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:08.816
BUT AS THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT

01:38:08.882 --> 01:38:10.684
TO BE. CLEAR THAT YOU NEED TO

01:38:10.751 --> 01:38:12.920
BE STRENGTHENS GIVEN WIDESPREAD

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:14.922
NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. THE

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:15.990
BIGGEST DATA COLLETOR IS LIKE

01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:17.658
GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK DECLARE

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:18.993
THAT THEIR DATA SHARING WAS

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:20.561
OUTSIDE OF THE OPT OUT OF SALEM

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:22.196
EMBOLDENED BY WE CAN FORSMAN

01:38:22.263 --> 01:38:23.731
PROVISIONS. COMPANIES EXPLOITED

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:25.165
LOOPHOLES TO CONTINUE TO

DELIVER CROSS EYED CROSS DEVICE

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:28.736
TARGET ADVERTISING. YOU KNOW

01:38:28.802 --> 01:38:30.471
GIVING CONSUMERS CONTROL OVER

01:38:30.537 --> 01:38:31.572
THIS KIND OF DATA SHARING WAS

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.173
ONE OF THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.010
THE CCPA. AND SO MANY COMPANIES

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:38.212
HAVE SIZE UP THE CZ PEERING WE

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:40.648
ARE PLEASED THAT THE CALIFORNIA

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:42.583
PRIVACY RIGHTS ACTS WOULD CLOSE

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:43.384
UP TARGET ADVERTISING

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:44.718
LOOPHOLES. STRENGTHEN

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:47.154
ENFORCEMENT AND HELP PREVENT

01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:48.422
THE LEGISLATURE FROM WEAKENING

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:50.591
THE MEASURE. AT THE SAME TIME

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:51.859
WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE

01:38:51.925 --> 01:38:53.093
BALLOT INITIATIVE INTRODUCES

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.962
NEW AMBIGUITIES AND GLASSES

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:57.164
CERTAINLY POLLS LIKE ALLOWING

01:38:57.231 --> 01:38:59.633
SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COMBINE

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:00.200
DATA RECEIVED FROM MULTIPLE

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:02.036
COMPANIES. AND FINALLY PRIVACY

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:03.137
IS A RIGHT NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:04.838
CONSUMERS SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:05.673
SO WE THINK IT'S A MISSED

01:39:05.739 --> 01:39:08.042
OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THAT

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:09.443
PRIVACY ISN'T JUST SOMETHING

01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:11.912
THAT THE RICH SHOULD ENJOY. SO

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:13.314
GOING TO THESE POINTS IN A

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:15.783
LITTLE MORE DETAIL. THE FIRST

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:17.251
THE BALLOT INITIATIVE WOULD CAN

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:18.919
GIVE CONSUMERS ETTER CONTROL

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:21.355
OVER TARGETED ADVERTISING- IN

01:39:21.422 --> 01:39:22.423
THIS IS TO BE THE DEFINITION OF

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.224
SALE AND THE SERVICE PROVIDER

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:26.060
EXEMPTION HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:28.896
BY COMPANIES TO CONTINUE TO

01:39:28.962 --> 01:39:30.364
DELIVER THESE ADS OUTSIDE THE

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:32.499
OPT OUT. WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:33.801
DEFINITION OF SALE EVEN THOUGH

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:35.169
IT IS A REALLY BROAD DEFINITION

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:36.437
OF SALES SOME COMPANIES HAVE

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:38.372
CLAIMED THAT BECAUSE MONEY IN

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:40.507
AND DAY DARKNESS BEING

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:42.976
EXCHANGED. IT'S NOT A SALE-

01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:45.512
WHAT HAPPENS IS MONEY IN DATA

01:39:45.579 --> 01:39:46.680
OFTEN FLOWS IN THE SAME

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:48.549
DIRECTION TO I TECH PLATFORMS

01:39:48.615 --> 01:39:51.952
TO SHOW ADS ON MULTIPLE SITES

01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:53.487
THE SERVICE WRITER EXEMPTION.

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:55.489
HAS ALSO BEEN EXPLOITED-

01:39:55.556 --> 01:39:56.757
PUBLISHERS ARE SAYING THAT THEY

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:59.159
CAN SHARE DATA- WITH HUNDREDS

01:39:59.226 --> 01:40:00.794
OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES TO

01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:02.262
DELIVER ADVERTISING AS PART OF

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:02.796
A SERVICE PROVIDER

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:04.164
RELATIONSHIPS THEY'LL BE

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:06.033
OUTSIDE THE OPT OUT. SO THE

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:08.902
BALLOT INITIATIVE WOULD-

01:40:08.969 --> 01:40:10.304
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY CREATING

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:12.906
THIS NEW CATEGORY OF SHARING

01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:14.041
THAT CONSUMERS WOULD HAVE THE

01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:16.076
OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF

01:40:16.143 --> 01:40:17.511
EXPOSING CLARIFIES THAT CROSS

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.213
CONTEXT TARGET ADVERTISING. IS

01:40:19.279 --> 01:40:20.614
PART OF THAT SO CONSUMERS COULD

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.583
OPT OUT. AND THE SERVICE WRITER

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:24.551
EXEMPTION IS SIGNED UP BY

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:26.520
EXCLUSIVELY CLARIFYING THAT

01:40:26.587 --> 01:40:27.554
CROSS CONTEXT TARGET

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:29.056
ADVERTISING ISN'T OP

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.825
PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS PURPOSE-

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:32.526
SO IT'S REMOVED FROM THE

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:35.696
SERVICE WRITER. EXEMPTION IN

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:37.030
OUR OPINION HOW THE BALLOT

01:40:37.097 --> 01:40:38.599
INITIATIVE WOULD MEANINGFULLY

01:40:38.665 --> 01:40:39.733
STRENGTH IN ENFORCEMENT

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.368
PARTICULARLY BY REMOVING THIS

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:43.771
RIGHT TO CURE PROVISION IN

01:40:43.837 --> 01:40:44.571
ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT

01:40:44.638 --> 01:40:46.173
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY. I GET OUT

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.308
OF JAIL FREE CARD- FEELS I

01:40:48.375 --> 01:40:49.910
THINK THE CREATING A NEW AGENCY

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:52.579
THAT'S EXCLUSIVELY DEVOTED TO

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:53.981
IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING THIS

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:56.350
LAW- COULD HELP PUT SOME TEETH

01:40:56.417 --> 01:40:57.918
BEHIND THE MEASURE AND WE ALSO

01:40:57.985 --> 01:40:59.953
APPRECIATE. THAT THIS DOES ALL

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:01.889
LIMIT THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY

01:41:01.955 --> 01:41:05.793
TO WEEKEND. THE LAW. BUT AT THE

01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:06.894
SAME TIME THE BALLOT SHOULD OF

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.062
INTRODUCES SOME LESS THAN IDEAL

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:11.565
ELEMENTS IN SOME CASES WEAKER

01:41:11.632 --> 01:41:13.300
THAN EXISTING LAW. FOR EXAMPLE

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:14.968
A CREATE A NEW CONFUSING

01:41:15.035 --> 01:41:16.470
EXEMPTION FOR SHARING PERSONAL

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:18.539
DATA WITH CONTRACTORS BEYOND

01:41:18.605 --> 01:41:20.441
WHAT'S ALREADY A LOT FOR

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:22.643
SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT ALSO

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.978
CREATES OF COMPLETED MECHANISM

01:41:25.045 --> 01:41:26.547
FOR CONSUMERS TO OPT OUT OF

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:28.849
SHARING OR SALE- SO THIS IS ONE

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.818
OF OUR TOP PRIORITY IS TO MAKE

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:32.753
SURE THAT THERE'S A UNIVERSAL

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:35.289
OPT OUT SO CONSUMERS DON'T HAVE

01:41:35.355 --> 01:41:36.557
TO GO TO EVERY SINGLE COMPANY

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:38.459
TO OPT OUT OF JAIL. FOR SHARING

01:41:38.525 --> 01:41:41.795
INFORMATION- WITH MORE THAN

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:42.429
THREE HUNDRED STATE WORKERS ON

01:41:42.496 --> 01:41:43.764
THE CALIFORNIA DATA BROKER

01:41:43.831 --> 01:41:46.800
REGISTRY ALONE NOT TO MENTION.

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:47.801
THE HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMPANIES

01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:48.969
THAT ARE COLLECTING CONSUMERS

01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:50.904
STATE. IF THEY'RE GONNA OPT OUT

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:52.105
ONE BY ONE THIS IS COMPLETELY

01:41:52.172 --> 01:41:54.308
UNWORKABLE- ESPECIALLY GIVEN

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:56.477
THAT SOME COMPANIES HAVE MADE

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:58.812
CONSUMERS JUMP THROUGH HOOPS IN

01:41:58.879 --> 01:42:01.148
ORDER TO OPT OUT- ONE DATA FOR

SEPARATE HOW TO MY PHONE- JUST

01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:08.956
ARTICLE ONCE- SO- YOU KNOW ONE

01:42:09.022 --> 01:42:11.191
CONSUMER TOLD ME THEY COULD

01:42:11.258 --> 01:42:14.361
EVEN COMPLETE ONE OPT OUT

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:18.298
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO MUCH WORK.

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:19.299
MAKING A SIMPLE SIMMERS IS

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:20.767
REALLY IMPORTANT THE CALL

01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:22.870
ATTORNEY RULES ARE CLEAR THAT

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:24.438
THEY WERE COME HAVE A GLOBAL DO

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:25.839
NOT SELL SIGNAL IN CONTRAST

01:42:25.906 --> 01:42:27.608
ABOUT INITIATIVE MANDATES THE

01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:29.943
COMPANIES THAT DO NOT WANT TO

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:32.679
PUT UP I DO NOT SO LINK MUST

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.848
UNDERGO POPPED UP TODAY TERRY

01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:37.985
AS TO WHETHER OTHER COMPANIES

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:39.152
WOULD HAVE. THAT AT LEAST SOME

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:40.988
REPORTERS AND LAW FIRMS ARE

01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:43.524
INTERPRETING THAT IS OPTIONAL-

01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:45.025
SO IDEALLY CONSUMERS WHEN HAVE

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:46.627
TO OPT OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:47.861
OF THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:50.797
WOULD BE. AUTOMATIC BUT AT THE

01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:52.633
VERY LEAST THIS OP DOC SHOULD

01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:55.702
BE VERY CLEAR AND SIMPLE AND

01:42:55.769 --> 01:42:58.005
THE BALANCE OF ITS A BIGGER SO

01:42:58.071 --> 01:43:00.574
FAST. SECONDS THE BILL

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:01.475
INITIATIVE IMPROPERLY LAWS

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:03.443
SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COMBINE

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:05.579
DATA- RECEIVE FROM OTHER

COMPANIES SERVICE WRITERS

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:08.782
SHOULD BE WORKING FOR JUST ONE

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:10.517
COMPANY AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:12.085
TALKING ABOUT SIR THE WRITERS

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:12.011
MORE DOLLARS WORKING ON

01:59:12.078 --> 01:59:13.679
COMPLIANCE AND THAT SPENDING

01:59:13.746 --> 01:59:15.515
CONTINUES NOW THAT THE AGES

01:59:15.581 --> 01:59:18.484
REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN FINALIZED.

01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:20.686
MEMBERS ARE NOT ANTI PRIVACY WE

01:59:20.753 --> 01:59:22.488
ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO THE MOST

01:59:22.555 --> 01:59:24.924
COMPREHENSIVE. I WAS THE LAWS

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:27.627
IN THE NATION CCPA BUT WE ARE

01:59:27.693 --> 01:59:28.995
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE C.

01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:30.596
P. R. EIGHT BECAUSE IT IS A

01:59:30.663 --> 01:59:32.532
FLEXIBLE AND IT WILL BE

01:59:32.598 --> 01:59:35.301
EXPENSIVE. FOR THE PUBLIC AND

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:38.170
PRIVATE SECTORS AT A TIME WHEN

01:59:38.237 --> 01:59:40.339
WE CAN ILL AFFORD IT. SEE IF

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:42.141
YOU'RE A HAVE A PROVISION THAT

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:44.010
ONLY PROVIDES FOR AMENDMENTS

01:59:44.076 --> 01:59:47.346
WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH AND

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:47.813
FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:49.048
INITIATIVE. WELL THIS SOUNDS

01:59:49.115 --> 01:59:50.950
APPEALING ON ITS FATE. IT

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:51.851
DOESN'T ALLOW FOR ANY

01:59:51.918 --> 01:59:53.486
FLEXIBILITY WHICH COULD BE

01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:56.923
NEEDED AS TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS FOR

01:59:56.989 --> 02:00:00.126
CRISIS DEMANDS. THIS IS NERVOUS.

02:00:00.192 --> 02:00:05.431
BEING. I DO AND NGUYEN CPR IS

02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:08.134
DRAFTED WE DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.036
THE NINETEEN. WE DIDN'T TALK

02:00:10.102 --> 02:00:12.772
ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING. WE

02:00:12.838 --> 02:00:14.941
COULD HAVE COMPREHENDED A TIME

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.776
WHEN WALKING INTO THE CAPITAL

02:00:16.842 --> 02:00:18.277
WE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

02:00:18.344 --> 02:00:20.079
HEALTH SCREENING FOR HAVE A

02:00:20.146 --> 02:00:23.049
TEMPERATURE TAKEN. MOST OF US

02:00:23.115 --> 02:00:23.683
HAD NEVER TALKED ABOUT CONTACT

02:00:23.749 --> 02:00:27.420
TRACING. AND I WANT TO TALK A

02:00:27.486 --> 02:00:29.288
LITTLE BIT ABOUT CONTACT

02:00:29.355 --> 02:00:30.790
TRACING IN PARTICULAR. BECAUSE

02:00:30.856 --> 02:00:32.425
THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:35.595
PRIVACY WITH THOSE WITH CONTACT

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:36.796
TRACING THERE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD

02:00:36.862 --> 02:00:38.764
BE. BUT THE GOVERNOR JUST

02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:40.900
ANNOUNCED THE CALIFORNIA

02:00:40.967 --> 02:00:43.769

FOLLOWING COUNTIES I'VE BEEN ON

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:49.041
THE STATE WHO ARE USING

02:00:49.108 --> 02:00:50.977
TECHNOLOGY TO ENCOURAGE

02:00:51.043 --> 02:00:53.980
EMPLOYERS TO REPORT HEALTH DATA

02:00:54.046 --> 02:00:56.148
REGARDING THEIR EMPLOYEES. ALL

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:58.184
IN THE NAME OF STOPPING THE

02:00:58.250 --> 02:01:00.453
SPREAD OF HOPE IT. BUT I WONDER

02:01:00.519 --> 02:01:01.921
IF CPR A WITH A LOT OF THE WAY

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:04.590

02:01:04.657 --> 02:01:06.325
THESE CRITICAL ACTIONS

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:08.894
NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE HEALTH

02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:10.663

AWARE HER WORLD CAN CHANGE

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:18.904
OVERNIGHT. WALKING INTO THE

02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:22.141
CAPITAL TODAY I WAS STRUCK I

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:24.110
HAVE NOT SEEN STORES BOARDED

02:20:43.468 --> 02:20:45.370
WILL BE HONORED BY AND

02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:46.738
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE CREATED

02:20:46.805 --> 02:20:49.073
BY THE AGENCY AND FINALLY.

02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:51.242
COULD UNCERTAINTY OVER THIS

02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:53.711
TRANSITION BE PROBLEMATIC. FOR

02:20:53.778 --> 02:20:55.647
THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES TO

02:20:55.713 --> 02:20:57.282
COMPLY WITH THE MEASURE. SO ANY

02:20:57.348 --> 02:20:59.184
PART OF THE- QUESTIONS FEEL

02:20:59.250 --> 02:21:01.486
FREE TO CHIME IN A WITH YOU

02:21:01.553 --> 02:21:07.826
HAVE A RESPONSE. AT RETAIL

02:21:07.892 --> 02:21:09.661
MICHELIN WITH THE RETAILERS I

02:21:09.727 --> 02:21:11.062
THINK THAT FROM A RETAIL

02:21:11.129 --> 02:21:12.864
PERSPECTIVE OUR MEMBERS ARE

02:21:12.931 --> 02:21:14.866
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR CLARITY THEY

02:21:14.933 --> 02:21:16.668
WANT TO KNOW WHY. WHAT ARE THE

02:21:16.734 --> 02:21:18.636
PARAMETERS THAT THEY NEED TO DO

02:21:18.703 --> 02:21:20.839
THEIR BUSINESS AND PARTICULARLY

02:21:20.905 --> 02:21:23.074
WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY SO I

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:24.342
THINK IN LOOKING BACK ON THE

02:21:24.409 --> 02:21:26.077
PROCESS THAT WE DID WITH AG

02:21:26.144 --> 02:21:27.812
REGULATIONS THAT WAS A LONG

02:21:27.879 --> 02:21:29.447
PROCESS I THINK WE STARTED IT

02:21:29.514 --> 02:21:31.549
END OF LAST YEAR. AGAIN THAT

02:21:31.616 --> 02:21:33.418
THE RAGS ONLY FINAL REX CAME

02:21:33.484 --> 02:21:36.554
OUT BUT TWO WEEKS AGO. AT SO I

02:21:36.621 --> 02:21:38.189
THINK THAT THERE IS I DON'T

02:21:38.256 --> 02:21:40.425
KNOW HOW YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT

02:21:40.491 --> 02:21:42.727
CONTINUITY WITH THE AGENCY THAT

02:21:42.794 --> 02:21:44.729
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO WILL BE

02:21:44.796 --> 02:21:46.965
PART OF THAT HELLO REALLY

02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:48.500
FUNCTION. SO THERE BE AYE THE

02:21:48.566 --> 02:21:49.500
BIGGEST CONCERN WOULD BE

02:21:49.567 --> 02:21:52.270
OPENING UP TO LIABILITY I THINK

02:21:52.337 --> 02:21:54.339
OPENING UP TO LAWSUITS AND

02:21:54.405 --> 02:21:57.542
WE'VE ARE SEEN EVEN THE CPA L.

02:21:57.609 --> 02:21:58.710
PEOPLE READY TO SUE

02:21:58.776 --> 02:22:00.778
PARTICULARLY SMALLER BUSINESSES

02:22:00.845 --> 02:22:03.348
THIS WAS JUST TRYING TO COMPLY.

02:22:03.414 --> 02:22:04.315
AND I THINK EVERYTHING IS GOING

02:22:04.382 --> 02:22:07.185
ON RIGHT NOW AGAIN THISWE

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:07.652

MONTHS AGO. AND YOU KNOW

02:22:13.992 --> 02:22:16.394
OBVIOUSLY WE WILL BE IN. THE

02:22:16.461 --> 02:22:18.696
WAY TODAY. I THINK THAT YOU

02:22:18.763 --> 02:22:20.899
KNOW. BEING ABLE GO EXACTLY

02:22:20.965 --> 02:22:22.133
WHAT THE RULES ARE SO WEAK

02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:26.304
COMPLY RETAILERS AND BUSINESS

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:30.975

02:22:31.042 --> 02:22:34.479
I WOULD SEE SOME. TO HER AND

02:22:34.545 --> 02:22:35.747
THEN TO TURN AND HAVE TO RE TO

02:22:35.813 --> 02:22:38.416
NEW ELATION BECAUSE OF INITIAL

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:39.017
pI THINK IT BE DOCTOR TO A LOT

02:22:39.083 --> 02:22:41.085
OF THESE IN OUR STATE. THANK

THAT FOR FREE. THIS TERMINATE I

02:22:53.731 --> 02:22:55.166
THINK THE REIGNING WORD HERE

02:22:55.233 --> 02:22:56.100
THAT WE KEEP HEARING NOT JUST

02:22:56.167 --> 02:22:57.802
AGAIN FROM THE INDUSTRY BUT

02:22:57.869 --> 02:22:58.403
FROM SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE IS

02:22:58.469 --> 02:23:01.906
UNCERTAINTY- LACK OF CLARITY-

02:23:01.973 --> 02:23:02.941
AND WE'RE FINDING THAT RIGHT

02:23:03.007 --> 02:23:04.742
NOW IN THIS SITUATION WITH CODE

02:23:04.809 --> 02:23:05.743
AMONG SO MANY SMALL BUSINESS

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.211
OWNERS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES

02:23:07.278 --> 02:23:09.547
THERE CAN STEP CONSUMERS- SO

02:23:09.614 --> 02:23:11.482
PEOPLE REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT I

02:23:11.549 --> 02:23:11.950
THINK ONE OF THE MOST

02:23:12.016 --> 02:23:14.185
COMPELLING THINGS WE I HEARD

02:23:24.762 --> 02:23:26.898
BUSINESSES WILL ADJUST SO AGAIN

02:23:26.965 --> 02:23:28.399
EVEN THE LEGISLATIVE THE NON

CLARITY AND UNCERTAINTY AS WE

02:23:32.904 --> 02:23:35.073
LOOK AHEAD IF PEOPLE WILL IT

02:23:35.139 --> 02:23:36.207
THAT'S WHAT THE COSTS WILL BE

02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:37.041
AND THAT'S ABOUT THE NEW

02:23:37.108 --> 02:23:38.276
PROPOSAL THIS HAS YET TO GO

02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:40.678
INTO EFFECT- AND NOT EVEN THE

ARE FOR ANY PALESTINIAN OF THE

02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:28.626
PALACE IN GENERAL FIRST

02:24:28.693 --> 02:24:29.894
QUESTION CONSIDERING THE

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

02:24:31.229 --> 02:24:33.031
NECESSARY TO AMEND THE CONTENT

02:24:33.097 --> 02:24:35.266
OF A BALLOT INITIATIVE AND THE

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:36.934
DYNAMIC NATURE OF INFORMATION

02:24:37.001 --> 02:24:39.604
TECHNOLOGY. WHAT MAKES A BALLOT

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.305
INITIATIVE RATHER THAN A

02:24:41.372 --> 02:24:42.907
LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION THE

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:44.208
APPROPRIATE MECHANISM FOR

AT THAT POINT IN TIME I DON'T

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.729
THINK THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IS

02:25:04.796 --> 02:25:07.565
THE PROPER MECHANISM THAT I

02:25:07.632 --> 02:25:09.634
THINK THAT WE BOUGHT THE IN HOW

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:12.437
COMPLICATED THE PROCESS AND

02:25:12.503 --> 02:25:14.105
THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH

THE LEGISLATURE RATHER RENT

02:25:17.175 --> 02:25:17.708

THINK THE LEGISLATURE- WAS VERY

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:36.961
WISE IN PUSHING CCPA THROUGH

02:25:37.028 --> 02:25:39.564
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND I

02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:40.865

02:25:40.932 --> 02:25:43.634
IMPORTANT- ARE LEGISLATORS ARE

02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:35.453
PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT WHETHER NOT

A PROVISION- THAT WOULD MAKE IT

02:26:46.864 --> 02:26:47.298
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE

02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:12.049
SPECIFIC REGULATION ASKING FOR

02:28:12.116 --> 02:28:14.118

THE EXISTING LAW YOU KNOW I

02:28:16.087 --> 02:28:17.388
HAVE TO KINDA LAUGHED BUT

02:28:17.455 --> 02:28:18.222
THINKING THAT I WOULD SPEND A

02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:19.657
LOT OF MONEY DOING THE FIRST

02:28:19.724 --> 02:28:20.958
LAW. AND THEN WOULD CONSCIOUSLY

02:28:21.025 --> 02:28:23.194
TRY TO SABOTAGE THE SECOND

02:28:23.261 --> 02:28:25.329
ALMOST ANY MORE TIME AND MONEY

02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:26.264
DOING IT. YOU KNOW IF THAT

02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:27.765
CRITICISM IS THAT I TALKED TO

02:28:27.832 --> 02:28:29.533

THE BUDGET OF TEN MILLION TO

02:28:58.663 --> 02:29:00.197
THE FTC'S BUT IF YOUR NAME IS

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.632
DIRECTOR FRANK RIDICULOUS. THE

02:29:01.699 --> 02:29:02.700
FTC HAS MANY MORE

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:03.567
RESPONSIBILITIES AND JUST

02:29:03.634 --> 02:29:05.069
PRIVACY. THIS WOULD HAVE THE

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:07.571
SAME NUMBER OF PRIVACY

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:09.106

FD AS FTC HAS FOR THE ENTIRE

COUNTRY. SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S

02:29:11.842 --> 02:29:14.478
THE RIGHT- COMPARISON AS I SAID

02:29:14.545 --> 02:29:17.381
BEFORE IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH. THE

02:29:17.448 --> 02:29:17.982
LEGISLATURE IN ITS WISDOM CAN

02:29:18.049 --> 02:29:19.250
VOTE MORE. THE ISSUE IS JUST

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:20.885
THAT THIS WOULD PREVENT IT FROM

02:29:20.951 --> 02:29:22.286
BEING DEFINED OF LIKE GOVERNOR

THAT IN OTHER AREAS THE C. D.

R. E. A. REPRESENTS ONLY HALF

02:35:34.258 --> 02:35:37.394
