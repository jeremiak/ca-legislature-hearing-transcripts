JUDICIAL SYSTEM- OF COURSE

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.213
JUSTICE DELAYED IS OFTEN

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.282
JUSTICE DENIED HOW DO WE MOVE

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:43.815
THINGS ALONG WE CREATE A

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:46.318
PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO HELP DO

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:46.885
THIS. BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.487
PRESSURE OF TIME. THE PROGRAM

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:51.290
MAKES A RECOMMENDATION THE

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.292
JUDGE SAYS OKAY THAT'S

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:54.960

IN AND WE DON'T KNOW IT THAT'S

00:20:05.203 --> 00:20:06.238
MY THING IS WE NEED TO HAVE THE

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:08.440
NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT HOW IT

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:10.676
GOT FROM POINT A OF. A TO POINT

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.110
B. AND THAT'S WHEN THE

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:13.078
CHALLENGES AN ARTIFICIAL

CERVANTES IDENTIFY PROBABLY THE

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.406
MOST. A CRUCIAL CONCERN WITH

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:55.207
RESPECT TO ARTIFICIAL

00:22:55.273 --> 00:22:56.041
INTELLIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO

BIAS IT'S GOING TO SHOW THE

00:22:58.243 --> 00:22:59.811
BIASES THE PERSON ACTUALLY

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:01.146
PROGRAM THE ARTIFICIAL

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.381
INTELLIGENCE SITUATION- WITH

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:05.517
RESPECT TO- JUDICIAL DECISIONS

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:09.621
IT'S AGAINST THE- USUAL ETHICS

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:11.256
TO WERE. BASICALLY WHAT A

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:12.524
COMPUTER MAKE THAT DECISION YOU

00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:14.693
HAVE TO HAVE THE UNDERLYING

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.328
FACTS IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:18.764
DECISION A WITH RESPECT TO MANY

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.534
OF WHAT JUDGES DO AND I'M NOT

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:23.135
SURE IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS

00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:25.504
MANY OF ITS TO IS BASED ON.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.640
WORK UP DONE BY LEGAL RESEARCH

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:31.009
PEOPLE ALL OF THE CLERICAL AND-

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:33.779
SOMETIMES THE COPIES OF THOSE

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:36.248
STAFF AND VERY STRONG MENTALLY

00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:38.216
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BIASES AND

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:40.719
I THINK WITH RESPECT TO A

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:44.222
DECISIONS AND WHAT THEY FEEL IS

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:44.823
IMPORTANT TO BRING THAT TO THE

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:50.695
JUDGE. MAY BE MORE OF. OTHER

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:51.630
CONSERVE THAN USING A AYE WITH

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:52.898
RESPECT TO- HAVE A GROUP OF

00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:54.499
JUDGES SAYING WE NEED TO LOOK

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:56.668
AT ALL THESE THINGS IN ORDER TO

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:58.370
HAVE A COMPLETE WORK UP TO GIVE

00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:00.272
TO THE JUDGE BECAUSE THAT

00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:02.140
PERSON MAY HAVE HAD A BAD DAY

00:24:02.207 --> 00:24:05.010
AND HAD SOMETHING WITH RESPECT

00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:07.445
TO A PERSON OF CERTAIN TYPE OF-

00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:09.281
RACIAL BACKGROUND WHEN THEY SEE

00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:10.081
THAT PERSONS OF THE

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:12.784
APPLICATION. OF THEY MIGHT SAY

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:13.351
WELL GOSH I'M NOT GOING TO

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:16.087
REALLY GIVE THIS OF THE A

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:19.090
DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE THAT IT

00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:20.225
DOES WELL WE GET IN A AYE

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:23.295
SITUATION OF THAT TYPE OF BIAS

00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:26.031
THAT MIGHT COME INTO THAT TYPE

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:28.567
OF DECISION MAKING IS NOT THERE

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.202
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:33.872
REPLACING A- PERSON WHO MIGHT

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:36.041
HAVE THEIR OWN BIASES WITH A

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:39.077
COMPUTER. SYSTEM THAT. PERHAPS

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.545
WHAT IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE IT.

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:43.248
BASICALLY LOOKS AT MORE FACTORS

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.116
IT'S NOT A SUBJECT TO THE WITH

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:48.486
THE MOTION OF A PERSON WHO THE

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:49.120
JUDGES OBVIOUSLY SOMETIMES WILL

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:53.959
RELY UPON. AND THE BUT I THINK

00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:55.560
WITH RESPECT TO BE MORE

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:56.862
COMPREHENSIVE AND LOOKING AT

00:24:56.928 --> 00:24:59.130
ALL THE FACTORS IF WE HAVE THE

00:24:59.197 --> 00:25:01.366
PROPER PROGRAM AND WE ARE AWARE

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:04.803
AND OF BECOME VERY AWARE OF THE

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.137
FACT THAT THERE COULD BE BIASES

00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:07.439
PLACED AND I THINK THAT MIGHT

00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:10.008
BE A SUPERIOR SIT SITUATION IN

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.476
ORDER TO MAKE A DECISION OKAY

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:12.444
WELL I APPRECIATE THE

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.045
PRESENTATION OF IT AGAIN I

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:15.480
THINK MY CONCERN WAS I

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:16.948
UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAINLY YOU

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:17.916
KNOW HAVING A PERSON COULD HAVE

00:25:17.983 --> 00:25:20.051
THEIR OWN BIASES. THAT'S MY

00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:22.787
EMPHASIS WAS ON TRANSPARENCY

00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:24.923
ESPECIALLY USING A AYE SO BEING

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.492
BE OF THE KNOW HOW YOU GOT FROM

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:30.195
INPUT TWO OUTPUT RIGHT IS THE

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:31.696
THING THAT I'M CALLING FOR NOT

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:32.631
SAYING THAT WE CAN'T USE A AYE

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:34.699
BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT TOO

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:37.636
OFTEN A I IT IS A BLACK BOX IN

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:38.169
BETWEEN AND OR FOR VARIOUS

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:41.006
REASONS SOMETIMES. THING IS

00:25:41.072 --> 00:25:41.640
PROPRIETARY SOMETHING ELSE AND

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:42.240
WE'RE GONNA USE INDEED USUAL

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:43.942
SYSTEM IT NEEDS TO BE

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.410
TRANSPARENT WE NEED TO BE ABLE

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:47.746
TO TRACE HOW. THESE INPUTS LED

00:25:47.812 --> 00:25:49.648
TO THAT OUTPUT SO CAN

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:50.215
UNDERSTAND AND THEN MAKE THE

00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:53.151
ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROGRAM. THE

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:54.252
TRY TO REMOVE THE BIAS OF THEIR

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:54.986
WE IN THAT A FIGHT WITH THANK

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:57.222
YOU. YES THE AS I THINK. SET

00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:59.424
TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT. AND

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:01.760
I THINK BY HAVING A AYE PROGRAM

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:03.828
YOU CAN'T BE MORE TRANSPARENT.

00:26:03.895 --> 00:26:05.230
BECAUSE I THINK JUDGES WOULD BE

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:08.166
VERY HESITANT TO. TO DISCLOSE

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:09.968
WHO THEY RELIED UPON WITH

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:12.404
RESPECT TO A LOCK WORKS OR A

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.673
LEGAL RESEARCH OPINION. LESS

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.341
THAN THEY WERE ABLE THAT THE

00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:17.475
COURT WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.444
A THIS IS OUR A OUR PROGRAM

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:20.378
THIS IS WHAT WE DO IN ORDER TO

00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:23.148
MAKE A DECISION. VERY GOOD ANY

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:24.282
