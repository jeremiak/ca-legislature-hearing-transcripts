AND THEN WE HAVE ORGANIZATIONAL

00:35:23.555 --> 00:35:27.359 region:rollup2
CLIMATE AND THAT IS THE ONE

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:29.027 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE CAN CONTROL.

00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:29.928 region:rollup2
AND WAS THE PURPOSE OF OUR

00:35:29.027 --> 00:35:31.630 region:rollup2
SURVEY.

00:35:29.928 --> 00:35:32.864 region:rollup2
AND ONE WERE ABLE TO MAKE

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:35.734 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO THAT CLIMATE WE CAN

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:37.369 region:rollup2
REDUCE THAT CULTURE AND WE GET

00:35:35.734 --> 00:35:38.970 region:rollup2

THEIR HEALTH THEIR ENGAGEMENT.

00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:50.615 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A MODEL THAT WE'VE

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:52.484 region:rollup2
CREATED A TALENT KEEPERS OVER

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:53.251 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN YEARS.

00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:54.919 region:rollup2
TO CHAU THE DRIVERS UP

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:56.988 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT.

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:58.556 region:rollup2
AND WE MEASURED THE

00:35:56.988 --> 00:36:00.825 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH ONE OF

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:02.160 region:rollup2
THESE DRIVERS AND OUR CLIMATE OF

WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE.

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:36.528 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY A HIGH PERFORMING

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:38.296 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION AN ORGANIZATION I'M

00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:40.131 region:rollup2
PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH BUT

00:36:38.296 --> 00:36:41.433 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IS DOING GOOD WORK SO

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:43.268 region:rollup2
THE SO THE DRIVERS.

00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:44.602 region:rollup2
OF EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND AT

00:36:43.268 --> 00:36:46.204 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM WE GET ALL THESE

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:47.972 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF COURSE THIS MODEL

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:50.909 region:rollup2
WAS DEVELOP VERY BROADLY --

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:51.876 region:rollup2
SO IN TERMS OF YOUR OUTCOMES

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:53.812 region:rollup2
WILL BE DIFFERENT DUDE THERE'S

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:55.346 region:rollup2
NO PROFITABILITY OBVIOUSLY FOR

00:36:53.812 --> 00:36:56.514 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

00:36:55.346 --> 00:37:00.151 region:rollup2
UMPS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE

00:36:56.514 --> 00:37:01.653 region:rollup2
SOME DIFFERENCES.

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:03.855 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT WE WANTED TO REALLY

00:37:01.653 --> 00:37:04.989 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON ARE THE ELEMENTS IN

00:37:03.855 --> 00:37:06.658 region:rollup2
THAT HIGH PERFORMING

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:08.727 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION DRIVER.

00:37:06.658 --> 00:37:10.862 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY CREATE A FAIR AND

00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:12.864 region:rollup2
INCLUSIVE CLIMATE SO WE CREATED

00:37:10.862 --> 00:37:13.364 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT WOULD

00:37:12.864 --> 00:37:17.068 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON THAT PARTICULAR

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:18.536 region:rollup2
ELEMENT.

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:21.039 region:rollup2
THE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED.

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:22.607 region:rollup2
FROM APRIL EIGHTEENTH THROUGH

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:24.976 region:rollup2
MAY ELEVENTH OF THIS YEAR THERE

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:26.478 region:rollup2
WERE TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:29.047 region:rollup2
SIXTY ONE ELIGIBLE.

00:37:26.478 --> 00:37:30.081 region:rollup2
OF RESPONDENTS THAT INCLUDED ALL

00:37:29.047 --> 00:37:31.649 region:rollup2
BENEFITS ELLA TOLD POLICE

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:33.952 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S VOLUNTEERS AND

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:35.286 region:rollup2
INTERNS.

00:37:33.952 --> 00:37:38.690 region:rollup2
AND OVERALL WE HAD A

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:40.158 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION RATE OF 46%.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:42.193 region:rollup2
DO YOU USE SOME BENCHMARKS IN A

00:37:40.158 --> 00:37:44.295 region:rollup2
SURVEY OF THIS TYPE WHICH IS AN

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:46.231 region:rollup2
ANONYMOUS SURVEY OF CONTENT THAT

00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:48.066 region:rollup2
IS SENSITIVE.

00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:51.469 region:rollup2
WE COULD EXPECT PARTICIPATION

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:53.404 region:rollup2
RATES BETWEEN THIRTY AND 50%.

00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:55.240 region:rollup2
SO TO BE AT 46% OF THE TOP END

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:56.207 region:rollup2
OF THAT RANGE.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.609 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A SLIGHT

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:59.511 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY

00:37:57.609 --> 00:38:01.246 region:rollup2
AND THE SENATE.

00:37:59.511 --> 00:38:04.349 region:rollup2
BUT GOOD PARTICIPATION GIVEN THE

00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:06.718 region:rollup2
NATURE OF THE SURVEY.

00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:09.020 region:rollup2
SO HERE THE FIVE ELEMENTS THAT

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:11.055 region:rollup2
WE LOOKED AT IN THE SURVEY.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:13.758 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE RANKED ORDERED THEM

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:15.927 region:rollup2
FROM STRONG GUEST TO LOWEST.

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:17.729 region:rollup2
SO CO WORKER ENGAGEMENT FOR THE

00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:19.430 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WAS THE STRONGEST

00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:20.431 region:rollup2
DRIVER OF ENGAGEMENT WE THINK

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:23.434 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:25.203 region:rollup2
CAN LEVERAGE GOING FORWARD.

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:27.105 region:rollup2
AND THE BENCHMARKS THAT YOU SEE

00:38:25.203 --> 00:38:29.007 region:rollup2
ON THE RIGHT ARE OUR GOVERNMENT

00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:30.041 region:rollup2
BENCHMARK THESE ARE NOT ALL.

00:38:29.007 --> 00:38:31.176 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SERVICE BENCHMARKS ARE

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:33.111 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:38:31.176 --> 00:38:35.146 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THAT GO TO THAT

00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:36.681 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT BENCHMARK ARE NOT ALL

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:37.849 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ABSOLUTELY VERY

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:39.484 region:rollup2
GENERAL --

00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:40.752 region:rollup2
BUT YOU CAN SEE YOUR WELL ABOVE

00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:43.855 region:rollup2
THAT GOVERNMENT BENCHMARK WHICH

00:38:40.752 --> 00:38:45.023 region:rollup2
IT'S AT 69% SO 83%.

00:38:43.855 --> 00:38:47.058 region:rollup2
OF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE ENGAGE

00:38:45.023 --> 00:38:48.860 region:rollup2
WHETHER CO WORKERS.

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:50.562 region:rollup2
SECOND IS LEADERSHIP.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.496 region:rollup2
THEIR IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR IS A

00:38:50.562 --> 00:38:53.198 region:rollup2
REAL STRENGTH FOR THE

00:38:51.496 --> 00:38:54.699 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE --

00:38:53.198 --> 00:38:57.769 region:rollup2
THEY BELIEVE THAT LEADER IS

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:58.670 region:rollup2
TRUSTING CONCERNED ABOUT THEM --

00:38:57.769 --> 00:38:59.871 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.005 region:rollup2
AS A COMPARISON TO THE

00:38:59.871 --> 00:39:03.208 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT BENCHMARK JUST A

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:05.510 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF POINTS BELOW.

00:39:03.208 --> 00:39:06.077 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT TARGET.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.980 region:rollup2
SEVENTY TWO JOB AND CAREER

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:10.348 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT WE SAID 62% --

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.218 region:rollup2
AGAIN A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE

00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:14.285 region:rollup2
THE BENCHMARK THAT WE HAVE --

00:39:13.218 --> 00:39:15.987 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK AT SOME OF THE

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:17.422 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS THAT COMPRISE EACH ONE

00:39:15.987 --> 00:39:19.190 region:rollup2
OF THESE DRIVERS IN THE ENSUING

00:39:17.422 --> 00:39:20.825 region:rollup2
SLIDES.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.926 region:rollup2
AND THEN ORGANIZATIONAL

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:24.362 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT REALLY BEGINS TO DROP

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:26.130 region:rollup2
OFF AND AGAIN THAT'S WHERE WE

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:28.366 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY SEE FAIR INCLUSIVE

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:29.867 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTS FALLING INTO THAT

00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:31.870 region:rollup2
AREA SO JUST 40%.

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:33.571 region:rollup2
OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE ENGAGED

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.540 region:rollup2
BY THE ORGANIZATIONAL DRIVER AND

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:38.176 region:rollup2
FINALLY THE FAIR AND INCLUSIVE

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.879 region:rollup2
CLIMATE ELEMENT WAS EVEN LOWER.

00:39:38.176 --> 00:39:42.180 region:rollup2
AT 36% FAVORABLE.

00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:44.182 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.650 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IN THE BOTTOM TWO

00:39:44.182 --> 00:39:47.085 region:rollup2
AREAS AND YOU CAN SEE WE DON'T

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.986 region:rollup2
HAVE A BENCHMARK FOR THE FAIR

00:39:47.085 --> 00:39:49.554 region:rollup2
INCLUSIVE CLIMATE.

00:39:47.986 --> 00:39:52.957 region:rollup2
ELEMENT THAT WAS UNIQUE. TO THE

00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:55.026 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:56.494 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE SOME STRENGTHS

00:39:55.026 --> 00:39:57.929 region:rollup2
LET'S BEGIN WITH THOSE.

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:59.364 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES ARE SATISFIED WITH

00:39:57.929 --> 00:40:00.465 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK DUTIES AND ARE

00:39:59.364 --> 00:40:04.269 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO THEIR WORK IN

00:40:00.465 --> 00:40:05.803 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SERVICE. 70% OF THEM ARE

00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:07.038 region:rollup2
SATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:08.072 region:rollup2
SATISFACTION.

00:40:07.038 --> 00:40:10.341 region:rollup2
I GENERALLY IS MORE

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:12.844 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IN TERMS OF THE

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:14.646 region:rollup2
LOCATION IN WHICH I WORK OUT

00:40:12.844 --> 00:40:16.981 region:rollup2
THAT THE THINGS THAT I'M WORKING

00:40:14.646 --> 00:40:18.049 region:rollup2
ON THE NATURE OF MY WORK.

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.950 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT IS DIFFERENT AND

00:40:18.049 --> 00:40:22.720 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM I

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:23.588 region:rollup2
WORK MY CO WORKERS BY LEADER.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.424 region:rollup2
OF THE PEOPLE THAT I INTERACT

00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:27.492 region:rollup2
WITH -- BUT

00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:28.893 region:rollup2
70% ARE SATISFIED WITH THAT

00:40:27.492 --> 00:40:30.428 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING THAT'S A REAL

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:32.597 region:rollup2
STRENGTH FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:34.699 region:rollup2
JOB DUTIES WERE CITED AS THE

00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:36.000 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE REASON EMPLOYEES ARE

00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:40.271 region:rollup2
STAYING IN THEIR ROLES THEY LOVE

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.606 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK. 78% OF EMPLOYEES

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:43.508 region:rollup2
INDICATE THE AND TEND TO STAY

00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:44.208 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEGISLATURE FOR THREE

00:40:43.508 --> 00:40:46.077 region:rollup2
YEARS OR MORE AND THAT IS

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:47.612 region:rollup2
REMARKABLE.

00:40:46.077 --> 00:40:49.280 region:rollup2
IN OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE

00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:52.183 region:rollup2
WHERE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.018 region:rollup2
AT RECORD LOWS THREE POINT 9% --

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:55.553 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT SEEN THAT TYPE OF

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:57.622 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT AND OTHER

00:40:55.553 --> 00:41:00.591 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS OTHER INDUSTRIES

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:02.493 region:rollup2
OUR TURNOVER IS INCREASING.

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:03.761 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS A VERY LONG

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:06.130 region:rollup2
TENURED OUTLOOK FOR YOUR

00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:07.031 region:rollup2
RESPONDENTS.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.199 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY EMPLOYEES ARE

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.900 region:rollup2
SATISFIED WITH THEIR HEALTH

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:10.468 region:rollup2
PLANS AND BELIEVE THE

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:12.003 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IS COMMITTED TO

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:14.038 region:rollup2
DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE

00:41:12.003 --> 00:41:14.572 region:rollup2
TO THE PUBLIC.

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:17.875 region:rollup2
SO REAL STRENGTHS FOR THE

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:19.544 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:21.379 region:rollup2
AN ADDITION I MENTIONED AT THE

00:41:19.544 --> 00:41:23.948 region:rollup2
DRIVER SLIDE THAT THERE IS A

00:41:21.379 --> 00:41:26.951 region:rollup2
REAL STRENGTH OF CO WORKERS AND

00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:28.753 region:rollup2
LEADERS SO 83% OF EMPLOYEES ARE

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:30.488 region:rollup2
ENGAGED BY THEIR CO WORKERS --

00:41:28.753 --> 00:41:31.923 region:rollup2
WE THINK AGAIN THIS IS ELEMENT

00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:33.791 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE IN AS PART

00:41:31.923 --> 00:41:35.994 region:rollup2
OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:37.929 region:rollup2
AND 70% WERE ENGAGED BY THE

00:41:35.994 --> 00:41:39.997 region:rollup2
DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR.

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:41.232 region:rollup2
OVER 80% OF THEM.

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:43.001 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THEIR SUPERVISORS

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:46.137 region:rollup2
TRUSTWORTHY CARING AND LISTENS

00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:48.539 region:rollup2
TO IDEAS SO ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT

00:41:46.137 --> 00:41:51.409 region:rollup2
WE CAN LEVERAGE TO INCREASE THAT

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:52.877 region:rollup2
FAIR AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE.

00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:55.079 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:56.481 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES DO NOT FEEL SECURE IN

00:41:55.079 --> 00:41:59.717 region:rollup2
THEIR JOBS AND DO NOT FEEL

00:41:56.481 --> 00:42:03.054 region:rollup2
RESPECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE.

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:04.489 region:rollup2
SO ONLY 55% OF EMPLOYEES BELIEVE

00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:06.124 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN POSITION OF POWER

00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:06.924 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

00:42:06.124 --> 00:42:10.461 region:rollup2
I HARASSMENT FREE WORK

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:12.897 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. 38% DO NOT BELIEVE

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:13.965 region:rollup2
VICTIMS OR REPORTERS OF

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:17.301 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT ARE FREE FROM

00:42:13.965 --> 00:42:18.436 region:rollup2
RETALIATION AND JUST A THIRD 33%

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:20.204 region:rollup2
TO NOT BELIEVE APPROPRIATE

00:42:18.436 --> 00:42:22.340 region:rollup2
ACTION WILL BE TAKEN.

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:23.408 region:rollup2
AFTER A COMPLAINT IS MADE SO

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.076 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES

00:42:23.408 --> 00:42:29.480 region:rollup2
HERE -- TO

00:42:25.076 --> 00:42:32.050 region:rollup2
CHANGE THOSE PERCEPTIONS.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.618 region:rollup2
AND OF THOSE TO INDICATE THAT

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.586 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED OR

00:42:33.618 --> 00:42:37.522 region:rollup2
WITNESSED HARASSMENT.

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:38.089 region:rollup2
FEMALES REPORTED HIGHER

00:42:37.522 --> 00:42:40.858 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS OF HARASSMENT THAN

00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:42.827 region:rollup2
MEN.

00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:44.796 region:rollup2
THE PERCENTAGE OF SUPERVISORY

00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:45.997 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL WHO REPORT HARASSMENT

00:42:44.796 --> 00:42:49.400 region:rollup2
IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF NON

00:42:45.997 --> 00:42:51.402 region:rollup2
SUPERVISED IN SOME CASES DOUBLE

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.838 region:rollup2
THE RATE OF REPORTING.

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:56.107 region:rollup2
HOWEVER BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE NON

00:42:53.838 --> 00:42:58.009 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEES.

00:42:56.107 --> 00:42:59.177 region:rollup2
THAT THE NUMBER THAT REPORTED

00:42:58.009 --> 00:43:03.147 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IN THE NON

00:42:59.177 --> 00:43:04.749 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORY ROLE IS GREATER.

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:06.284 region:rollup2
THE MOST PREVALENT INDICATION OF

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:08.419 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT RESULTED FROM

00:43:06.284 --> 00:43:13.424 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS WITH LOBBYISTS OR

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:15.293 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:16.994 region:rollup2
AND CAPITAL EMPLOYEES REPORTED

00:43:15.293 --> 00:43:23.868 region:rollup2
HIGHER INCIDENTS OF HARASSMENT

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:25.336 region:rollup2
THAN THOSE LOCATED IN THE TO SO

00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:27.538 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT EACH

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:30.508 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE DRIVERS AND THE

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:32.577 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS THAT COMPRISE THEM --

00:43:30.508 --> 00:43:34.545 region:rollup2
AGAIN BE INDEX OVERALL FOR

00:43:32.577 --> 00:43:36.113 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION ENGAGE WAS AT 40%

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:37.682 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY HIGHER FOR THE ASSEMBLY

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:39.484 region:rollup2
THEN THE SENATE.

00:43:37.682 --> 00:43:42.286 region:rollup2
AND HERE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT

00:43:39.484 --> 00:43:44.055 region:rollup2
COMPRISE THAT.

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:46.624 region:rollup2
SO ONE ELEMENT OF THE

00:43:44.055 --> 00:43:49.327 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS HERE IS THE TRUTH

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:51.462 region:rollup2
OVERALL ENGAGEMENT INDEX IS NOT

00:43:49.327 --> 00:43:53.464 region:rollup2
AN SIMPLE AVERAGE OF THE ITEM

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:55.099 region:rollup2
SCORES -- SO

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:58.002 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY THERE'S BELOW US ITEM

00:43:55.099 --> 00:44:00.471 region:rollup2
SCORES 44% OF THE INDEXES FORTY

00:43:58.002 --> 00:44:00.938 region:rollup2
THE MATH TO DO THAT IS IS AT THE

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:01.839 region:rollup2
BOTTOM WE LOOK AT EACH

00:44:00.938 --> 00:44:03.608 region:rollup2
RESPONDENT.

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:04.876 region:rollup2
AND OF THEIR AVERAGE RATING ON A

00:44:03.608 --> 00:44:07.378 region:rollup2
FIVE POINT SCALE OF AGREEMENT

00:44:04.876 --> 00:44:09.313 region:rollup2
WHERE FIVE TO STRONGLY AGREE.

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:11.482 region:rollup2
IS THREE DOT SIX FIVE OR HIGHER

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:12.683 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DEEMED TO BE ENGAGED SO

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:14.352 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THE

00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:15.253 region:rollup2
MATH BETWEEN THE OVERALL INDEX.

00:44:14.352 --> 00:44:17.455 region:rollup2
AND THE PERCENTAGES NEXT TO THE

00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:19.123 region:rollup2
ITEMS THE ITEMS INDICATE THE

00:44:17.455 --> 00:44:20.591 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE.

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:21.826 region:rollup2
OF RESPONDENTS HAD AGREED WITH

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:23.628 region:rollup2
EACH OF THOSE STATEMENTS OR

00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:25.663 region:rollup2
STRENGTH IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:44:23.628 --> 00:44:26.931 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATES.

00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:28.399 region:rollup2
DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE

00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:30.501 region:rollup2
TO THE PUBLIC IS A HIGH PRIORITY

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:32.370 region:rollup2
WITH 69% OF RESPONDENTS AGREEING

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:33.538 region:rollup2
TO THAT.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:37.141 region:rollup2
MANAGERS ARE ACCESSIBLE

00:44:33.538 --> 00:44:39.977 region:rollup2
APPROACHABLE. 64% AND THEN WE

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:41.412 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO FALL BELOW THE 50% RATE

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:42.780 region:rollup2
WERE LESS THAN HALF OF THE

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:45.149 region:rollup2
RESPONDENTS AGREED WITH THE

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.551 region:rollup2
STATEMENT SO ONLY 49%.

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:49.554 region:rollup2
AGREED THE LEGISLATURE SHOWS

00:44:46.551 --> 00:44:52.223 region:rollup2
RESPECT FOR EMPLOYEES. 45% I

00:44:49.554 --> 00:44:53.357 region:rollup2
FEEL I CAN QUESTION THE POLICY.

00:44:52.223 --> 00:44:58.229 region:rollup2
FOR PRACTICE WITHOUT FEAR OF

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:58.829 region:rollup2
BEING PENALIZED AND 44%.

00:44:58.229 --> 00:44:59.430 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THEIR EMPLOYERS

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:00.298 region:rollup2
PROCESSED AND PROCEDURES TO

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:03.000 region:rollup2
EVALUATE AND PROMOTE EMPLOYEES

00:45:00.298 --> 00:45:04.068 region:rollup2
IS FAIR.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:11.375 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS SOME OPPORTUNITIES

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:12.310 region:rollup2
AREAS THERE.

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:17.048 region:rollup2
YOU FEEL THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:18.816 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:19.450 region:rollup2
WELL NEXT INDEX OR DRIVER IS THE

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:22.553 region:rollup2
JOB AND CAREER ENGAGEMENT INDEX

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:23.721 region:rollup2
--

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:25.456 region:rollup2
62% EFFECTIVE OVERALL FOR

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:47.038 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN THIS IS A STRENGTH OF

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:49.006 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE BELIEVE

00:46:47.038 --> 00:46:50.207 region:rollup2

HOW TO DO THINGS BETTER.

00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:13.431 region:rollup2
OTHER CONCERN FOR ME AS AN

INDIVIDUAL THESE ARE ALL VERY

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:18.202 region:rollup2
STRONG ELEMENTS THAT ARE REALLY

EXPECTATIONS AND THE REASONS

00:47:50.134 --> 00:47:54.505 region:rollup2
BEHIND CHANGING PRIORITIES.

00:47:52.403 --> 00:47:55.473 region:rollup2
AS 72% BELIEVE THAT THEIR

00:47:54.505 --> 00:47:56.907 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS AWARE OF

00:47:55.473 --> 00:47:57.908 region:rollup2
GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE

WORKPLACE IN RESPONSE

00:47:57.908 --> 00:48:04.014 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:05.583 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL VERY STRONG ELEMENTS.

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:08.152 region:rollup2
AND THEN ARE FAIR AND INCLUSIVE

00:48:05.583 --> 00:48:09.954 region:rollup2
CLIMATE INDEX 36% [inaudible]

00:48:08.152 --> 00:48:11.255 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT.

00:48:09.954 --> 00:48:12.790 region:rollup2
STRONGER FOR THE ASSEMBLY THEN

00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:13.958 region:rollup2
THE SENATE BY TEN POINTS OUR

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:16.527 region:rollup2
BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:18.496 region:rollup2
TWO HOUSES.

00:48:16.527 --> 00:48:21.599 region:rollup2
BEGINNING AT THE TOP --

00:48:18.496 --> 00:48:23.634 region:rollup2
86% UNDERSTAND [inaudible]

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:24.401 region:rollup2
THEIR EMPLOYERS.

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:30.241 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:33.544 region:rollup2
POLICY. 72% ARE AWARE OF THE

00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:34.945 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT PROCESS.

00:48:33.544 --> 00:48:37.615 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE BEGIN TO DEPART FROM

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:39.049 region:rollup2
THOSE VERY STRONG NUMBERS 255%

00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:41.218 region:rollup2
BELIEVE INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:45.589 region:rollup2
OF POWER SUPPORT HARASSMENT FREE

00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:47.291 region:rollup2
WORK ENVIRONMENT. 54% BELIEVE

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.325 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS POLICIES AND

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:49.760 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THAT PROVIDE EQUAL

00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:50.728 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO STAFF REGARDLESS

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:55.366 region:rollup2
OF MEMBERSHIP AND PROTECTED

00:48:50.728 --> 00:48:56.934 region:rollup2
CLASSES. 40% BELIEVE THAT IF

00:48:55.366 --> 00:48:58.302 region:rollup2
THEY REPORT HARASSMENT WITH A

00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:59.770 region:rollup2
WITNESS IT OR EXPERIENCE IT

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:00.771 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.839 region:rollup2
BY FOLLOWING THE COMPLAINT

00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:04.775 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT APPROPRIATE ACTION

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:07.311 region:rollup2
WILL BE TAKEN.

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:08.913 region:rollup2
AND 39% ARE CONFIDENT THAT IF

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:10.481 region:rollup2
THEY REPORT HARASSMENT WITNESSED

00:49:08.913 --> 00:49:13.150 region:rollup2
OR EXPERIENCED THERE WOULD BE NO

00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:15.085 region:rollup2
RISK OF RETALIATION. FOR

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:17.488 region:rollup2
THEMSELF FOR THE VICTIM.

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:19.557 region:rollup2
THE LAST ITEM WE WANT A LOWER

00:49:17.488 --> 00:49:21.959 region:rollup2
SCORE AND THAT IS I'VE HEARD

00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:23.794 region:rollup2
OTHERS MAKE JOKES OF WORK ABOUT

00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:25.496 region:rollup2
PROTECTED CLASS.

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:30.434 region:rollup2
SO JUST 34% AGREED WITH THAT IS

00:49:25.496 --> 00:49:32.036 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WOULD WANT.

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:34.505 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ONE OTHER ELEMENT BEFORE

00:49:32.036 --> 00:49:37.141 region:rollup2
LOOK AT RECOMMENDATIONS AND A

00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:39.376 region:rollup2
VERY COMMON METRIC IN.

00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:41.045 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS TO LOOK AT WHETHER

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:43.214 region:rollup2
OR NOT YOUR EMPLOYEES.

00:49:41.045 --> 00:49:44.815 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS WOULD RECOMMEND THE

00:49:43.214 --> 00:49:47.351 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AS A GOOD PLACE TO

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:48.352 region:rollup2
WORK TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:49.653 region:rollup2
INSTALLED THE EMPLOYEE NET

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:51.188 region:rollup2
PROMOTER SCORE.

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:52.923 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THE ONE QUESTION THAT

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:54.158 region:rollup2
DID NOT USE A FIVE POINT SCALE

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:55.960 region:rollup2
OF AGREEMENT USED A TEN POINT

00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:58.963 region:rollup2
SCALE.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.731 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU RESPONDED ON THAT TEN

00:49:58.963 --> 00:50:01.999 region:rollup2
POINT SCALE WORST TENNIS I

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:03.334 region:rollup2
STRONGLY AGREE.

00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:04.935 region:rollup2
YOU WERE CONSIDERED TO BE A

00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:06.704 region:rollup2
PROMOTER IF YOU READY THAT A

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:08.239 region:rollup2
NINE OR A TEN IF YOU RATED THAT

00:50:06.704 --> 00:50:09.840 region:rollup2
A SEVEN OR EIGHT EIGHT YOU WERE

00:50:08.239 --> 00:50:12.009 region:rollup2
DEEMED TO BE PASSIVE.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.545 region:rollup2
AND SIX OR BELOW YOU WERE DEEMED

00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:16.614 region:rollup2
TO BE A DETRACTOR.

00:50:14.545 --> 00:50:18.182 region:rollup2
AND SO THE RANGE OFSCORES

00:50:16.614 --> 00:50:20.484 region:rollup2
RANGES FROM NEGATIVE ONE HUNDRED

00:50:18.182 --> 00:50:21.585 region:rollup2
TWO POSITIVE ONE HUNDRED OVERALL

00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:23.087 region:rollup2
FOR THE LEGISLATURE WE RATE

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:24.622 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE THREE YOU CAN SEE THE

00:50:23.087 --> 00:50:25.723 region:rollup2
NUMBERS.

00:50:24.622 --> 00:50:27.992 region:rollup2
OF DETRACTORS PASSIVES AND

00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:29.927 region:rollup2
PROMOTERS --

00:50:27.992 --> 00:50:31.695 region:rollup2
THE GOAL IS TO BE AT THIRTY OR

00:50:29.927 --> 00:50:34.331 region:rollup2
ABOVE.

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:36.333 region:rollup2
MODERATE IS CONSIDERED BETWEEN

00:50:34.331 --> 00:50:38.469 region:rollup2
ONE AND THIRTY SO NOT.

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:40.671 region:rollup2
NOT ALL BAD NEWS THAT BAG OF

00:50:38.469 --> 00:50:43.173 region:rollup2
THREE OF THE GOAL IS TO MOVE OUR

00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:45.376 region:rollup2
PASSIVE TO PROMOTERS.

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:45.876 region:rollup2
SO THEY CAN WRITE THAT A NINE OR

00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:47.544 region:rollup2
TEN AND OF COURSE SUCH A

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:48.779 region:rollup2
TRACTORS UP AS WELL.

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:53.717 region:rollup2
AND THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:54.585 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE SENATE FOR THE USE.

00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:56.120 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ASKED WHAT WOULD

00:50:54.585 --> 00:50:57.821 region:rollup2
INCREASE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.356 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE'S GOOD

00:50:57.821 --> 00:51:00.324 region:rollup2
PLACE TO WORK THE NUMBER ONE

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:02.293 region:rollup2
MOST FREQUENTLY CITED ISSUE WAS

00:51:00.324 --> 00:51:04.395 region:rollup2
PAY?

00:51:02.293 --> 00:51:06.430 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED BY CAREER AND MANY

00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:10.768 region:rollup2
TIMES IT WAS CAREER GROWTH.

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:12.937 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED BY LEADERSHIP

00:51:10.768 --> 00:51:14.738 region:rollup2
[inaudible] ONE OTHER.

00:51:12.937 --> 00:51:16.707 region:rollup2
SET OF QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK WAS

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:18.509 region:rollup2
THE STRONGEST REASON THAT YOUR

00:51:16.707 --> 00:51:19.443 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:21.145 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO STAY WITH THE

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:23.147 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:24.582 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED BY ONE THING THAT WOULD

00:51:23.147 --> 00:51:26.250 region:rollup2
CAUSE THEM TO LEAVE IF IT

00:51:24.582 --> 00:51:27.885 region:rollup2
DOESN'T CHANGE SO STARTING ON

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.954 region:rollup2
THE STATE SIDE --

00:51:27.885 --> 00:51:32.389 region:rollup2
DUTIES DOING WORK THAT MATTERS

00:51:29.954 --> 00:51:34.391 region:rollup2
WAS THE NUMBER ONE REASON CITED

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:38.062 region:rollup2
24% OF ALL RESPONSES --

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:39.229 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED BY BENEFITS CO WORKERS.

00:51:38.062 --> 00:51:41.165 region:rollup2
OTHERS THREE ELEMENTS ON THE

00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:42.800 region:rollup2
STATE SIDE THAT ARE VERY STICKY

00:51:41.165 --> 00:51:44.301 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TEND TO STAY FOR A LONG

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.236 region:rollup2
TIME WHEN THEY STAY FOR PEOPLE

00:51:44.301 --> 00:51:47.771 region:rollup2
AND OPPORTUNITIES.

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:49.373 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WOULD BE OUR CO

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:50.874 region:rollup2
WORKERS CAREER AND LEADERSHIP

00:51:49.373 --> 00:51:52.376 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES.

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:54.812 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL FREE AGGREGATE THOSE

00:51:52.376 --> 00:51:56.113 region:rollup2
TOGETHER LOOKING ABOUT 37% OF

00:51:54.812 --> 00:51:57.414 region:rollup2
ALL STAY REASONS FALLING INTO

00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:59.116 region:rollup2
THOSE CATEGORIES SO WE'D LIKE TO

00:51:57.414 --> 00:52:00.584 region:rollup2
GET THAT HIGHER.

00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:03.187 region:rollup2
STRONGER WE CAN GET THAT THE

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:05.155 region:rollup2
LONGER YOU'LL HAVE RETENTION --

00:52:03.187 --> 00:52:06.857 region:rollup2
ON THAT LEAVES SIDE PAY WAS THE

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:08.359 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE REASON WITH THIRTY

00:52:06.857 --> 00:52:09.793 region:rollup2
SIX POINT 7% OF RESPONSES

00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:11.095 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH PAY --

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:12.763 region:rollup2
THE THEMES THERE WERE THE

00:52:11.095 --> 00:52:14.031 region:rollup2
FEELING THAT PAY MAYBE A LITTLE

00:52:12.763 --> 00:52:16.300 region:rollup2
STAGNANT --

00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:19.036 region:rollup2
AND THERE MAY BE SOME IN EQUITY

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:20.471 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF ONE PERSON DOING --

00:52:19.036 --> 00:52:22.106 region:rollup2
OR TWO PEOPLE DOING THE SAME JOB

00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:24.742 region:rollup2
AND ONE BEING PAID SOUP

00:52:22.106 --> 00:52:26.010 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE FOR IT.

00:52:24.742 --> 00:52:27.644 region:rollup2
THE SECOND MOST COMMON WAS

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:29.179 region:rollup2
CAREER AND THAT WAS LACK OF

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:30.781 region:rollup2
GROWTH THEIR ADVANCEMENT.

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:32.349 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY LEADERSHIP AND THAT

00:52:30.781 --> 00:52:35.119 region:rollup2
THAT WITH A HOSTILE ON FAIR WORK

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:37.855 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. ONE THING TO NOTE

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:40.057 region:rollup2
IS WE HAD ABOUT.

00:52:37.855 --> 00:52:42.693 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOME ODD

00:52:40.057 --> 00:52:44.061 region:rollup2
MORE STAY REASONS THEN LEAVE.

00:52:42.693 --> 00:52:45.329 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:46.163 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SAID THERE'S NOTHING

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:48.432 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WOULD COST THEM TO

00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:53.037 region:rollup2
LEAVE SO VERY HEALTHY TO SEE

00:52:48.432 --> 00:52:55.072 region:rollup2
MORE STAY RECENT INSTANTLY.

00:52:53.037 --> 00:52:56.473 region:rollup2
SO SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OF FIRST

00:52:55.072 --> 00:52:57.841 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:59.143 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE POLICIES AND

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:00.611 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES AND PROPHECIES THAT

00:52:59.143 --> 00:53:02.112 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE.

00:53:00.611 --> 00:53:04.348 region:rollup2
AROUND HARASSMENT AND HOW TO

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:05.916 region:rollup2
CREATE A ACCEPTING UNFAIR OPEN

00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:07.851 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:09.520 region:rollup2
ALSO WE RECOMMEND THAT THERE BE

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:11.355 region:rollup2
A REVIEW FIRST TO ASSESS THE

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.523 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

00:53:11.355 --> 00:53:13.824 region:rollup2
AND THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE

00:53:12.523 --> 00:53:15.059 region:rollup2
CURRENT CLIMATE NOT KNOWING WHEN

00:53:13.824 --> 00:53:18.696 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE WRITTEN.

00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:21.632 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THEIR CURRENT.

00:53:18.696 --> 00:53:23.233 region:rollup2
AND ARE THEY CLEARLY DEFINED.

00:53:21.632 --> 00:53:25.636 region:rollup2
SECOND WOULD BE TO RESET IN

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:27.538 region:rollup2
TERMS OF EDUCATING EMPLOYEES.

00:53:25.636 --> 00:53:29.406 region:rollup2
ON WHAT APPROPRIATE AVENUES

00:53:27.538 --> 00:53:31.442 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TO LOG COMPLAINTS.

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:32.776 region:rollup2
AND TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT

00:53:31.442 --> 00:53:35.379 region:rollup2
HAPPENS ONCE THE COMPLAINT IS

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:37.548 region:rollup2
MADE.

00:53:35.379 --> 00:53:39.883 region:rollup2
THIRD THEN WOULD BE TO EVALUATE

00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:42.019 region:rollup2
HOW WELL THOSE POLICIES AND

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:44.421 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES ARE BEING USED.

00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:46.123 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IS THE RATE OF USAGE.

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:48.592 region:rollup2
HARM UNDER THE UNEMPLOYED

00:53:46.123 --> 00:53:50.394 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS --

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:52.563 region:rollup2
HOW WELL ARE THEY BEING EXECUTED

00:53:50.394 --> 00:53:54.598 region:rollup2
HARD TO FOLLOW UP STEPS THAT ARE

00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:55.699 region:rollup2
DEFINED IN YOUR PROCESS ONCE THE

00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:57.367 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT IS MADE ARE THEY BEING

00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:58.902 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED?

00:53:57.367 --> 00:54:00.137 region:rollup2
SO INDIVIDUALS ARE AWARE OF

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:02.339 region:rollup2
WHERE THEIR COMPLAINT MAY BE IN

00:54:00.137 --> 00:54:04.308 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS.

00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:05.943 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY ENFORCE THOSE

00:54:04.308 --> 00:54:06.810 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHICH IS

00:54:05.943 --> 00:54:07.411 region:rollup2
A BALANCE BETWEEN

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:09.680 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE PROCESS

00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:11.582 region:rollup2
--

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.317 region:rollup2
WITH TRANSPARENCY IN WHERE WE

00:54:11.582 --> 00:54:14.418 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE INVESTIGATION.

00:54:13.317 --> 00:54:18.989 region:rollup2
AND FOLLOW UP WITH THAT PERSON

00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:20.157 region:rollup2
WHO REPORTS.

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:21.558 region:rollup2
THE SECOND AND THIRD

00:54:20.157 --> 00:54:23.227 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE HERE I

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:25.896 region:rollup2
MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES THE

00:54:23.227 --> 00:54:28.398 region:rollup2
STRENGTH OF YOUR CO WORKERS 83%

00:54:25.896 --> 00:54:30.100 region:rollup2
ENGAGED BY THEIR CO WORKERS --

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:31.301 region:rollup2
SOLUTION OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.036 region:rollup2
THAT BY EDUCATING ALL

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:35.472 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS ON HOW TO CREATE

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:37.808 region:rollup2
THAT FAIR INCLUSIVE CLIMATE.

00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:39.610 region:rollup2
MORE EMPLOYEES REPORTED THAT

00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:40.911 region:rollup2
THEY WITNESSED HARASSMENT.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:43.213 region:rollup2
THEN THEY REPORTED EXPERIENCING

00:54:40.911 --> 00:54:44.948 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:46.717 region:rollup2
SO WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:48.685 region:rollup2
BYSTANDERS WHO WITNESSED THAT

00:54:46.717 --> 00:54:50.420 region:rollup2
TAKE ACTION.

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:51.522 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF THEIR AFFILIATION

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:54.158 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR CO WORKERS THEY SHOULD

00:54:51.522 --> 00:54:57.161 region:rollup2
BE SO MOTIVATED.

00:54:54.158 --> 00:54:58.629 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WANT TO EDUCATE ALL OF

00:54:57.161 --> 00:55:00.497 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEES ON HOW TO

00:54:58.629 --> 00:55:02.065 region:rollup2
ANONYMOUSLY REPORT INCIDENTS

00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:03.233 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE WITNESSED.

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:06.937 region:rollup2
AND THE COURAGE THE EMPLOYEES TO

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:08.739 region:rollup2
MAKE REPORTS.

00:55:06.937 --> 00:55:11.575 region:rollup2
THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS TO

00:55:08.739 --> 00:55:13.544 region:rollup2
BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT.

00:55:11.575 --> 00:55:15.312 region:rollup2
STEPS INVOLVED IN THE PROPHECIES

00:55:13.544 --> 00:55:16.780 region:rollup2
INCLUDING WHO WILL BE HANDLING

00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:18.615 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS.

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:21.685 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THAT FEAR

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:23.520 region:rollup2
OF RETALIATION.

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:25.355 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE LEADERS HAVE AN

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.357 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO MODEL.

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:28.892 region:rollup2
HOW THEY SHOULD WORK?

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:30.027 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF BEING ACCOUNTABLE

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:31.829 region:rollup2
FOR FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE

00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:33.297 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES AND CREATING A FAIR

00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:34.398 region:rollup2
AND INCLUDE INCLUSIVE CLIMATE

00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:36.233 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT A PRIORITY IN THE WAY

00:55:34.398 --> 00:55:37.935 region:rollup2
THEY LEAD.

00:55:36.233 --> 00:55:39.870 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE INCIDENTS OF OR THE

00:55:37.935 --> 00:55:41.872 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF SUPERVISORY

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:43.006 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL WHO REPORTED.

00:55:41.872 --> 00:55:44.741 region:rollup2
WITNESSING OR EXPERIENCING WAS

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:47.644 region:rollup2
DOUBLE THE RATE.

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:48.478 region:rollup2
OF NON SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL SO

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.813 region:rollup2
WE WANT THEM TO STEP UP OF DAY I

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:51.615 region:rollup2
HAVE WITNESSED.

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:52.616 region:rollup2
OR EXPERIENCE THAT THEY SHOULD

00:55:51.615 --> 00:55:54.852 region:rollup2
MODEL THE APPROPRIATE RATE TO

00:55:52.616 --> 00:55:56.787 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT.

00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:58.188 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY WE WILL REASSESS

00:55:56.787 --> 00:56:00.390 region:rollup2
THESE METRICS WITH A FOLLOW UP

00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:02.059 region:rollup2
SURVEY ONCE THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.926 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENACT

00:56:02.059 --> 00:56:04.094 region:rollup2
CHANGES.

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:08.532 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THOSECHANGES FLOW

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:10.200 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

00:56:08.532 --> 00:56:10.701 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS THE PRESENTATION

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.737 region:rollup2
THAT I HAD PREPARED THIS

00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:15.739 region:rollup2
MORNING.

00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:17.908 region:rollup2
THANK QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:21.411 region:rollup2
PANEL MUSTERED DAILY.

00:56:17.908 --> 00:56:24.881 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DON'T SHARE --

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:28.819 region:rollup2
SO THE ONE I THINK THE THE THE

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:29.253 region:rollup2
BIGGEST QUESTION FOR ME IS THAT.

00:56:28.819 --> 00:56:32.890 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T

00:56:29.253 --> 00:56:34.458 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE.

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:35.792 region:rollup2
AND IN IT THERE WAS A REASON

00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:38.262 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T PARTICIPATE BECAUSE

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:39.897 region:rollup2
THERE WAS FEAR.

00:56:38.262 --> 00:56:42.332 region:rollup2
THEN IT WOULD SKEW THE WHOLE

00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:45.469 region:rollup2
OUTCOME OF THIS --

00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:48.038 region:rollup2
SURVEY IF THEY DID IF THEY FELT

00:56:45.469 --> 00:56:49.239 region:rollup2
SECURE AND THE AND THE OPTIONS

00:56:48.038 --> 00:56:50.974 region:rollup2
WERE OR THE RESULTS WERE

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:53.076 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

00:56:50.974 --> 00:56:53.844 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT TIME IS VERY

00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:55.946 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO GET.

00:56:53.844 --> 00:56:58.081 region:rollup2
THEM TO BUY IT FOR EVERYBODY TO

00:56:55.946 --> 00:56:59.549 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE SO THAT WE CAN

00:56:58.081 --> 00:57:02.419 region:rollup2
REALLY GET A A A A PER FREAKS

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:04.821 region:rollup2
SURVEY.

00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:09.293 region:rollup2
SO I'M JUST IN MY OWN.

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:12.829 region:rollup2
TIME OF LISTENING --

00:57:09.293 --> 00:57:14.331 region:rollup2
TO EMPLOYEES OF OF THE BODY.

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:16.333 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WERE MANY THAT DID

00:57:14.331 --> 00:57:18.468 region:rollup2
NOT PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY

00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:21.104 region:rollup2
DIDN'T TRUST THE SYSTEM.

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:21.705 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO YOU --

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:22.873 region:rollup2
I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GRAPPLE

00:57:21.705 --> 00:57:25.742 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:57:22.873 --> 00:57:26.877 region:rollup2
THE RESULTS IF FOLKS DIDN'T

00:57:25.742 --> 00:57:30.080 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THERE WAS

00:57:26.877 --> 00:57:31.815 region:rollup2
FEAR OF RETALIATION OR THERE WAS

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.115 region:rollup2
NO TRUST TO WHAT AND IN

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:34.084 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:35.585 region:rollup2
IN OTHER.

00:57:34.084 --> 00:57:37.621 region:rollup2
S. CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE YOU SEEN

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:39.990 region:rollup2
THIS BEFORE AND WHAT WHAT DO YOU

00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:41.858 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU DO WHAT DO YOU DO.

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:42.426 region:rollup2
TO GET PARTICIPATION IN IN A IN

00:57:41.858 --> 00:57:44.294 region:rollup2
THE ARENA WHERE PEOPLE HAVE

00:57:42.426 --> 00:57:46.196 region:rollup2
TRUST.

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:48.832 region:rollup2
SO PARTICIPATION RATES ARE

00:57:46.196 --> 00:57:51.902 region:rollup2
ALWAYS A CHALLENGE THIS SUBJECT

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:53.270 region:rollup2
MATTER IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.

00:57:51.902 --> 00:57:55.539 region:rollup2
GENERALLY EMPLOYEES WILL

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:57.374 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IF THEY SEE VALUE IN

00:57:55.539 --> 00:57:58.809 region:rollup2
DOING SO.

00:57:57.374 --> 00:58:00.677 region:rollup2
AND THEY GENERALLY JUDGE VALUE

00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:02.212 region:rollup2
IN TWO WAYS.

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:03.447 region:rollup2
FIRST DID THEY HEAR ANYTHING

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:05.515 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE FOR OF

00:58:03.447 --> 00:58:06.616 region:rollup2
THE SURVEY THE PREVIOUS SURVEY

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:07.451 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE WERE TRYING TO GET

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:08.885 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION UP IN THE SECOND

00:58:07.451 --> 00:58:09.720 region:rollup2
SURVEY.

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:11.254 region:rollup2
AND SECONDLY DID THEY SEE

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.223 region:rollup2
ANYTHING CHANGE AS A RESULT OF

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:15.158 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:16.560 region:rollup2
SO GOING FORWARD WE WOULD HOPE

00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:18.762 region:rollup2
TO SEE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.297 region:rollup2
THE 46% WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS

00:58:18.762 --> 00:58:21.398 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

00:58:20.297 --> 00:58:23.200 region:rollup2
AND THOSE TWO ELEMENTS

00:58:21.398 --> 00:58:25.869 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION OF THE RESULTS AND

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.371 region:rollup2
THEM SEEING CHANGES BEING MADE

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.904 region:rollup2
IN THEIR WORKPLACE.

00:58:27.371 --> 00:58:30.374 region:rollup2
WOULD DRIVE PARTICIPATION

00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:32.609 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

00:58:30.374 --> 00:58:33.877 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND ADMINISTRATION.

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:35.746 region:rollup2
I THINK IN TERMS OF THE CURRENT

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:36.947 region:rollup2
DATA IT'S WHAT WE HAVE IT'S

00:58:35.746 --> 00:58:40.250 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE RANGE OF WHAT WE

00:58:36.947 --> 00:58:42.452 region:rollup2
WOULD EXPECT WHICH IS 3250% --

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:44.654 region:rollup2
I THINK ALSO SUPERVISORY

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:46.023 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL TALKING TO THEIR TEAMS

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:47.591 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR

00:58:46.023 --> 00:58:48.925 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN THE SURVEY.

00:58:47.591 --> 00:58:52.162 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING THEM TO PARTICIPATE

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:54.564 region:rollup2
ALL OF THAT HELPS [inaudible]

00:58:52.162 --> 00:58:56.333 region:rollup2
JUST.

00:58:54.564 --> 00:58:58.301 region:rollup2
IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR --

00:58:56.333 --> 00:58:59.870 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IF YOU HAD 30% JUST I'M

00:58:58.301 --> 00:59:03.573 region:rollup2
JUST PICKING A NUMBER.

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:05.609 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAD 30% OF THE FORTY NINE

00:59:03.573 --> 00:59:08.211 region:rollup2
THAT DIDN'T PARTICIPATE.

00:59:05.609 --> 00:59:09.513 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT WITH?

00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:11.548 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO TRUST THAT WOULD

00:59:09.513 --> 00:59:14.217 region:rollup2
TOTALLY CHANGE THIS.

00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:16.586 region:rollup2
THE THE OUTCOME OF THIS SURVEY.

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:17.487 region:rollup2
IN.

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:19.256 region:rollup2
IN WHERE WE SHOULD HEAD MAYBE

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:21.224 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

00:59:19.256 --> 00:59:23.627 region:rollup2
I THINK THE DATA IN BE FAIR

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:25.028 region:rollup2
INCLUSIVE DRIVER THAT WE THE

00:59:23.627 --> 00:59:27.364 region:rollup2
LAST WE LOOKED AT WERE WORKED

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:29.199 region:rollup2
FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL IN TERMS OF

00:59:27.364 --> 00:59:30.834 region:rollup2
THE ITEMS THAT WERE LOW.

00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:32.469 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOT SUSPECT THAT IF

00:59:30.834 --> 00:59:34.137 region:rollup2
THERE WERE ANOTHER 30% WHO

00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:35.472 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATED WHO DIDN'T TRUST

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:36.406 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM I DON'T THINK THE

00:59:35.472 --> 00:59:38.809 region:rollup2
DATA WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:40.143 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:41.611 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:43.080 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED BY THE RESPONDENT

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:44.781 region:rollup2
GROUP AS THE ONES.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:47.818 region:rollup2
NEEDING ATTENTION ARE LIKELY TO

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:49.386 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE CHANGED [inaudible]

00:59:47.818 --> 00:59:53.557 region:rollup2
THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:59:49.386 --> 00:59:54.858 region:rollup2
MS WALDRON.

00:59:53.557 --> 00:59:55.492 region:rollup2
EGGMAN -- TO

00:59:54.858 --> 00:59:56.827 region:rollup2
JUST ON THAT THE SCREEN THAT

00:59:55.492 --> 00:59:58.295 region:rollup2
JUST HAPPENS TO BE UP ON NUMBER

00:59:56.827 --> 01:00:00.430 region:rollup2
FIVE IT TALKS ABOUT EVALUATING

00:59:58.295 --> 01:00:01.998 region:rollup2
GOING BACK AND REASSESSING AND

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.400 region:rollup2
WITH A FOLLOW UP SURVEY.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:05.502 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THIS

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:08.338 region:rollup2
THE TIMING? FOR THAT I MEAN HOW

01:00:05.502 --> 01:00:11.274 region:rollup2
LONG ONCE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED IN.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:12.242 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A YEAR SIX MONTHS YOU

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.243 region:rollup2
HAVE LONGER THAN THAT AT WHAT

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:14.978 region:rollup2
POINT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:15.579 region:rollup2
START TO LOOK AT DOING A FOLLOW

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:17.414 region:rollup2
UP.

01:00:15.579 --> 01:00:19.115 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY WAITING AT LEAST SIX

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:20.550 region:rollup2
MONTHS AFTER ALL OF YOUR CHANGES

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:22.586 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ENACTED.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.553 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE FROM THAT SIX TO TWELVE

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:24.387 region:rollup2
MONTHS TIME FRAME AFTER THEY'VE

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:26.823 region:rollup2
BEEN PLACED SO THAT THE

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:27.424 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES GET A CHANCE TO SEE

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.124 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE ARE ACTUALLY PLAYING

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:29.626 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:32.596 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND DOING THE

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:33.763 region:rollup2
EXACT SAME SURVEYS YOU CAN.

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:35.298 region:rollup2
COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES OR

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:36.566 region:rollup2
WOULD IT BE CHANGE SOMEONE WE

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.468 region:rollup2
KNEW TYPICALLY RECOMMEND THE

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:40.670 region:rollup2
EXACT SAME SURVEY WITH A COUPLE

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:41.071 region:rollup2
OF ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT ASK

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.006 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:45.208 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THEY HEARD ABOUT

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:47.878 region:rollup2
THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST SURVEY

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:48.545 region:rollup2
HAD THEY SEEN THINGS CHANGE AS A

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:51.281 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THAT [inaudible]

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:53.550 region:rollup2
OKAY -- JUST

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:54.918 region:rollup2
A JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP.

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:55.552 region:rollup2
WHEN NEAR?

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:58.822 region:rollup2
OR ABOVE THAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT

01:00:55.552 --> 01:01:01.324 region:rollup2
EDUCATING STE.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:03.260 region:rollup2
CLOSE OF CLIMATE --

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:05.428 region:rollup2
WHEN EMPLOYEES ARE WITNESSING

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:07.631 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE BYSTANDERS --

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:08.865 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU FOUND OR HOW HAS IT

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:10.300 region:rollup2
WORKED WITH YOU KNOW THE

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:12.002 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.737 region:rollup2
PEOPLE USING APPS TO REPORT

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:15.138 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS HAVE THEY BEEN

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:16.139 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL I MEAN I DON'T.

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:18.208 region:rollup2
THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS DAY AND

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:19.543 region:rollup2
AGE IS.

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:22.445 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FAMILAR WITH ABSENT.

01:01:19.543 --> 01:01:25.248 region:rollup2
HOW THEY WORK AS COMPARED?

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:26.950 region:rollup2
TO OTHER FORMS OF REPORTING.

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:29.019 region:rollup2
YEAH FORCE I DON'T HAVE GOOD

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:31.288 region:rollup2
DATA ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:32.822 region:rollup2
APPS AS A WAY TO COLLECT A

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:34.090 region:rollup2
REPORT DATA I DON'T HAVE THAT

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:36.059 region:rollup2
FOR YOU TODAY [inaudible]

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:44.034 region:rollup2
THANK.

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:45.702 region:rollup2
IT'S A MEMBER IS.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.570 region:rollup2
I I NEED IN REVIEWING THIS

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.437 region:rollup2
ALREADY I FEEL GOOD ABOUT SOME

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.039 region:rollup2
OF THIS.

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:49.639 region:rollup2
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:52.842 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYEES

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:53.944 region:rollup2
--

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:55.779 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR CORN PLOY THESE I

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:57.514 region:rollup2
FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT.

01:01:55.779 --> 01:02:00.417 region:rollup2
I FEEL THAT --

01:01:57.514 --> 01:02:01.685 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:04.654 region:rollup2
AND WHERE WE LOSE THEM IS THE

01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:06.022 region:rollup2
TRUST IN THE END THEY KNOW THE

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:07.190 region:rollup2
PROCESSES THEY KNOW HOW TO

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:08.625 region:rollup2
REPORT.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.893 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW HOW HOW TO IDENTIFY

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:12.596 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT BUT THEY DON'T TRUST

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:14.731 region:rollup2
THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE GOING

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:16.366 region:rollup2
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:18.001 region:rollup2
IN THE VERY BEGINNING YOU TALKED

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:20.003 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS FAIR AND INCLUSIVE

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:21.371 region:rollup2
CLIMATE.

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:23.707 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THAT'S WHAT IT IS WE'RE

01:02:21.371 --> 01:02:27.244 region:rollup2
TRYING TO CHANGE.

01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:29.045 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING?

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:30.981 region:rollup2
I THINK IT BEGINS WITH.

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:32.349 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE OUR

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:34.818 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:36.720 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE IN PLACE APPROPRIATE.

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:38.955 region:rollup2
FOR TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.124 region:rollup2
AND HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:42.158 region:rollup2
EXECUTION OF THOSE POLICIES AND

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.627 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:02:42.158 --> 01:02:45.729 region:rollup2
RESEARCH.

01:02:43.627 --> 01:02:47.364 region:rollup2
IN THE INDUSTRY ABOUT TRAINING

01:02:45.729 --> 01:02:49.666 region:rollup2
AND AND MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE

01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:51.468 region:rollup2
DOING TRAINING --

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:52.669 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S MORE OF A CHECK THE BOX

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:54.671 region:rollup2
TRAINING DID EVERYONE GO THROUGH

01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:55.905 region:rollup2
THE TRAINING.

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:57.874 region:rollup2
VERSES HOW EFFECTIVE WAS THE

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:59.843 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:01.278 region:rollup2
AT EDUCATING THE EMPLOYEES ON

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:03.013 region:rollup2
THE PROCESSES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:05.148 region:rollup2
TO THEM.

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:07.384 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE DOES THAT

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:08.852 region:rollup2
COHORT HAVE BEEN USING THAT

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:10.420 region:rollup2
PROCESS SO --

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:12.522 region:rollup2
STEPS TO TAKE AROUND THAT WOULD

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:14.190 region:rollup2
BE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AS

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:15.625 region:rollup2
PART OF THE TRAINING EVALUATION.

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:17.160 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT JUST DID YOU ATTEND

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:18.161 region:rollup2
BUT ARE YOU NOW COMFORTABLE AND

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.096 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGEABLE FOLLOWING THESE

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:21.865 region:rollup2
PROCESS THESE.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:23.600 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK GETTING SUPERVISORY

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:26.002 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL TO MODEL.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.504 region:rollup2
IF THE INCIDENTS OF HARASSMENT

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:28.905 region:rollup2
FOR NOT SUPERVISOR PERSONNEL IS

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:30.373 region:rollup2
DOUBLE THAT OF NON SUPERVISORY

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:31.908 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL.

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:33.009 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT WE WOULD

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:35.512 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF SUPERVISORY

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:37.213 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL USING THAT PROCESS.

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.381 region:rollup2
AND SO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:39.783 region:rollup2
DONE I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE THE

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:43.553 region:rollup2
REST OF THE ORGANIZATION MORE

01:03:39.783 --> 01:03:45.822 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE FOLLOWING THE PROPS.

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:48.591 region:rollup2
THANK YOU IT AT PAGE TEN

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:50.660 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:52.962 region:rollup2
IT'S THOSE EMPLOYEES DO NOT FEEL

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:55.065 region:rollup2
SECURE IN THEIR JOBS.

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:56.633 region:rollup2
HE PICKED UP OUR I WOULD MY

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:58.401 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS IS THERE A QUESTION

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:58.635 region:rollup2
BETWEEN FEELING SECURE AND

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:00.670 region:rollup2
FEELING.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:02.272 region:rollup2
SAFE.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.972 region:rollup2
A FEELING SECURING YOUR JOB OUR

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:05.075 region:rollup2
OUR EMPLOYEES ARE AT WILL

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:06.643 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:07.243 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:08.111 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DON'T FEEL SECURE

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:10.447 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE AT WILL

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:12.315 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:13.750 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WAS THE FACT THAT

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:15.919 region:rollup2
THEY WEREN'T COMFORTABLE

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:17.554 region:rollup2
QUESTIONING A POLICY OR

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:19.856 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:20.890 region:rollup2
PENALIZED.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:24.160 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE NATURE OF THAT

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:26.429 region:rollup2
ELEMENT.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:31.601 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE LAST AREA IS AT

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:33.203 region:rollup2
PAGE [inaudible]

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:34.671 region:rollup2
ELEVEN SEE.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.739 region:rollup2
THE MOST PREVAILING INDICATION

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:37.574 region:rollup2
OF HARASSMENT RESULTED FROM

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:39.709 region:rollup2
LOBBYISTS.

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:40.944 region:rollup2
AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.378 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED A CONFLUENCE OF

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:44.314 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS WITH AND

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:45.949 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS.

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:48.084 region:rollup2
BUT THE DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:50.754 region:rollup2
DON'T ADDRESS.

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:52.889 region:rollup2
ANY SPECIFIC REPORTING. FOR THE

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:54.858 region:rollup2
ISSUES RELATED TO LOBBYISTS AND

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:56.659 region:rollup2
THE THIRD PARTY OR THIRD PARTIES

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:58.228 region:rollup2
OR POP UP PUBLIC.

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:59.462 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WOULD GO BACK TO

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.897 region:rollup2
OUR FIRST SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:02.699 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE POLICIES AND

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.767 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES IN TERMS OF ARE THEY

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.435 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FOR THE CURRENT

01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:06.970 region:rollup2
CLIMATE.

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:09.172 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR CURRENT

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.739 region:rollup2
POLICIES SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED

01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:11.875 region:rollup2
LOBBYISTS OR MEMBERS OF THE

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:13.576 region:rollup2
PUBLIC.

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:15.345 region:rollup2
BUT IF THEY DON'T THAT WOULD BE

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.613 region:rollup2
S. A RECOMMENDATION TO MAKE SURE

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:18.214 region:rollup2
THAT THAT.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:19.015 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENCY OR THE ACTS THAT

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:20.183 region:rollup2
COHORT IS A SPECIFICALLY

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:22.619 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED.

01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:24.120 region:rollup2
BY THE POLICIES AND THEY'RE VERY

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:28.191 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY ON THAT THEN WITH

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:31.461 region:rollup2
THE IF IF THERE IS A HARASSMENT.

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:32.695 region:rollup2
BY LOBBYIST ON ONE OF OUR STAFF.

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:34.464 region:rollup2
DOES NOT REPORT GO TO OUR

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:36.800 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL DOESN'T GO

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:37.801 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR PROCESS AND JUST

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.568 region:rollup2
JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT THEY'RE

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:40.069 region:rollup2
JUST ARE THEY JUST OF THE

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:42.038 region:rollup2
CULTURE SURVEY THEY HAVE NOT

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:43.306 region:rollup2
REVIEWED OUR POLICIES THEY

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:45.141 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GIVING IN THEIR NOT

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:46.376 region:rollup2
GIVING SUGGESTIONS AS TO OUR

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:47.610 region:rollup2
POLICY SO I THINK.

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.745 region:rollup2
I WOULD RECOMMEND HOLDING THOSE

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.580 region:rollup2
KINDS OF QUESTIONS UNTIL WE

01:05:48.745 --> 01:05:52.415 region:rollup2
PRESENT THE POLICIES.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:54.317 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT I JUST THINK THAT THIS

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:55.685 region:rollup2
IS A THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:57.353 region:rollup2
JUST THINK THAT THIS IS SUCH AN

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:59.622 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ASPECT.

01:05:57.353 --> 01:06:01.558 region:rollup2
OF THE FINDINGS IT IF WE'RE

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:04.093 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HARASSMENT OF OUR

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:05.628 region:rollup2
STAFF IF WE'RE FINDING THAT THE

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:06.963 region:rollup2
THE GREATEST MAJORITY IS COMING

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.064 region:rollup2
FROM LOBBYIST IN FROM THE

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.098 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE.

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:12.202 region:rollup2
CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING TO

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:13.736 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:14.404 region:rollup2
I SEVEN TO TAKE JUST A CHAIR'S

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:15.672 region:rollup2
PREROGATIVE JUST JUMP IN AND ASK

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:17.006 region:rollup2

WHICH IS THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:19.576 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:22.078 region:rollup2
NOT SPECIFIC TO SEXUAL

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:24.447 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT CORRECT CORRECT SO

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:25.048 region:rollup2
JUST TO MAKE THE POINT TO THE

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.515 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE ALL KNOW

01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:26.816 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.917 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ANSWERING THE PHONE YOU

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.953 region:rollup2
CAN FEEL PRETTY HARASSED BY THE

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:31.521 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SOMETIMES IF THERE'S

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:32.155 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE.

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:34.691 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS DOING THAT THEY'RE

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:36.993 region:rollup2
NOT HAPPY ABOUT KEEP THAT IN

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:38.628 region:rollup2
MIND IT ALSO IN THE FUTURE IF WE

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.796 region:rollup2
DO THIS WHEN WE DO THIS AGAIN.

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:41.497 region:rollup2
WE PROBABLY SHOULD FIRST OUTING

01:06:39.796 --> 01:06:43.299 region:rollup2
SEPARATE LOBBYIST FOR MEMBERS OF

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:44.234 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC FOR THAT VERY REASON

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:46.903 region:rollup2
IT'S A DIFFERENT TO DIFFERENT

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:47.537 region:rollup2
ANIMAL IN THIS UNIVERSE.

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:50.406 region:rollup2
CONTINUE WITH THE PANEL SENATOR

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:51.040 region:rollup2
MITCHELL.

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:53.743 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.078 region:rollup2
--

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:56.779 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK

01:06:55.078 --> 01:06:58.815 region:rollup2
ALL THE STAFF.

01:06:56.779 --> 01:07:01.017 region:rollup2
WHO TOOK THE TIME TO RESPOND AND

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:03.987 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO DIDN'T --

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:05.288 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA LOOK TO RULES STAFF

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:06.990 region:rollup2
FROM BOTH HOUSES IN THE FIRST

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:08.057 region:rollup2
ROW JUST TO VERIFY THAT WHAT I'M

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:09.392 region:rollup2
A MISSTATEMENT MONTH I'M ABOUT

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:10.693 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IS TRUE AND THAT THIS IS

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:12.862 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:16.165 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENGAGED

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:17.934 region:rollup2
TO CLIMATE SURVEY FOR STAFF.

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:22.272 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.

01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:23.239 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO SAY I AS THEY'VE IN MY

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:24.173 region:rollup2
PRIOR LIFE AND THEN THE PLAY

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.775 region:rollup2
BEFORE COMING HERE I WAS

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:28.478 region:rollup2
SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER.

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:29.746 region:rollup2
OF EMPLOYEES AND LEGISLATE TOWER

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:32.849 region:rollup2
WOULD NEVER EXPERIENCE A CLIMATE

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:34.317 region:rollup2
SURVEY SO THIS IS VERY NEW.

01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:37.153 region:rollup2
ARM AND ARE WE NOW WITH ALL

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:38.588 region:rollup2
THINGS NEW --

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:39.956 region:rollup2
GENERALLY REGARDLESS OF THE

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:41.691 region:rollup2
CRIME OR CURRENTLY LIVING MAN

01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:43.459 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE SKEPTICISM.

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:45.762 region:rollup2
IF YOU COULD FLIP TO PAGE TWENTY

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:46.596 region:rollup2
TWO FORMALLY.

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:53.736 region:rollup2
I DISLIKE TWENTY TWO I

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:56.406 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT --

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:58.374 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S LIKE [inaudible]

01:07:56.406 --> 01:08:00.543 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE YES.

01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:01.878 region:rollup2
BECAUSE GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT'S

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:03.613 region:rollup2
NEW WE HAVE A UP BY AN EMPLOYEE

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:04.847 region:rollup2
POOL THAT NEVER.

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:08.551 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATED IN A CLIMATE SO BE

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:10.320 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE PAINSTAKINGLY SENSE

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:12.855 region:rollup2
CRAFTED THE LETTERS THAT WERE

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.890 region:rollup2
SIGNED BY LETTER SHIP LEADERSHIP

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:15.758 region:rollup2
AND PAINSTAKINGLY.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:17.093 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE WORDING OF EVERY

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:19.529 region:rollup2
QUESTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:21.798 region:rollup2
WERE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:25.001 region:rollup2
TO GET TO A ROUTE ANSWERED THAT.

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:27.971 region:rollup2
ALL WAS USEFUL IN THIS PROCESS.

01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:29.639 region:rollup2
AND SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE E.

01:08:27.971 --> 01:08:31.574 region:rollup2
IN PS COLUMN.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:34.143 region:rollup2
WHEN I LOOK AT THE DETRACTOR

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:36.746 region:rollup2
PASSIVE PROMOTER NUMBERS?

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:38.481 region:rollup2
THAT TO ME LOOKS LIKE AN

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:42.885 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL BELL CURVE.

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:45.655 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN BE --

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:47.390 region:rollup2
TRANSPOSED TO OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:08:45.655 --> 01:08:48.725 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY ARE ELECTED BY THE

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:50.326 region:rollup2
VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WE

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:52.295 region:rollup2
REPRESENT MAY NOT.

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:53.796 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE TRANSPOSON MANY

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:55.865 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROBABLY

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:57.900 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CONSIDERED HEALTHY.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:59.535 region:rollup2
YOU GOT DISSED DETRACTORS.

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:01.004 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY ON THE PASSIVE

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:02.639 region:rollup2
I COME TO WORK EVERYDAY AND DO

01:09:01.004 --> 01:09:04.741 region:rollup2
MY JOB WHATEVER.

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:07.910 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE PROMOTERS WHO ARE

01:09:04.741 --> 01:09:11.881 region:rollup2
TRUE CHAMPIONS IN CHEERLEADERS

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:12.515 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S HOW I PRINT READ THE

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.149 region:rollup2
THREE FIFTY SIX FIVE FORTY THREE

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.650 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR THAT IT SORT OF EAT

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.985 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A BELL CURVE.

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:17.620 region:rollup2
LOW HIGH THEN GOES BACK LOW.

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:18.788 region:rollup2
SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:21.057 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY THE RAIN

01:09:18.788 --> 01:09:22.492 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ONE TO THIRTY AND WE

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:24.293 region:rollup2
SEE A NEGATIVE NUMBER UP THERE.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:26.629 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T COMPETE WITH MY

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:28.698 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF THE BELL

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:29.966 region:rollup2
CURVE'S NUMBERS SO HELP ME.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:31.401 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH YOU IT DOES LOOK

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:33.069 region:rollup2
LIKE A BELL CURVE IN TERMS OF

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:34.804 region:rollup2
THOSE DATA.

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:36.906 region:rollup2
BEING IT E. NPS CALCULATION IS A

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:39.208 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT ONE TO STRINGENT ONE

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:40.743 region:rollup2
SO THAT MATH IS WE TAKE THE

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:42.245 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PROMOTERS.

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:44.914 region:rollup2
WE SUBTRACT THE NUMBER OF

01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:45.948 region:rollup2
DETRACTORS AND WE DIVIDE BY ALL.

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:50.186 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A MEASURE THAT'S VERY

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:51.254 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND IT'S ONE THAT THE

01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:53.156 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SHOWS IF WE CAN GET

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:55.558 region:rollup2
POSITIVE.

01:09:53.156 --> 01:09:57.026 region:rollup2
IT BEGETS MORE POSITIVITY WE

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:59.429 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE PEOPLE.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:10:00.029 region:rollup2
BEING CHAMPIONS CHEERLEADERS FOR

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:02.098 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND IT BECOMES

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.566 region:rollup2
IN FACT.

01:10:02.098 --> 01:10:04.801 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT IS YOUR RIGHT IT'S A

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:05.902 region:rollup2
BELL CURVE DATA.

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:08.538 region:rollup2
BUT WE WOULD.

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:12.508 region:rollup2

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:21.184 region:rollup2
HE TURNED BACK TO SLIDE THIRTEEN

01:10:19.248 --> 01:10:21.984 region:rollup2
FORMING IT'S ANOTHER METHODOLOGY

01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:27.190 region:rollup2

ON THE BOTTOM YEAH THAT'S

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:37.433 region:rollup2
DIVIDED BY.

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:38.101 region:rollup2
CARRIED THE ONE HELP EARLY.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.335 region:rollup2
SO WE WE LOOKED AT EACH

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:42.205 region:rollup2
RESPONDENTS.

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:43.639 region:rollup2
RATINGS OF THESE ITEMS AND THEY

01:10:42.205 --> 01:10:45.374 region:rollup2
RATED THEM ON A FIVE POINT SCALE

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:46.309 region:rollup2
OF AGREEMENT FIVE AS I STRONGLY

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:48.644 region:rollup2
AGREE.

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:51.247 region:rollup2
IF THE RATING ACROSS ALL FIVE OF

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:52.915 region:rollup2
THOSE ITEMS WAS THREE POINT SIX

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.884 region:rollup2
FIVE OR HIGHER THAT INDIVIDUALS

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:56.652 region:rollup2
DEEMED TO BE ENGAGED BY THAT

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:58.521 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR DRIVER GOD THEY WOULD

01:10:56.652 --> 01:11:00.790 region:rollup2
BE IN THE PROMOTER CATEGORY IN

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:02.125 region:rollup2
IN THAT VERNACULAR YES GOT IT.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.826 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S A LITTLE MORE

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:06.562 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO GET SOMEONE TO KEEP

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:08.097 region:rollup2
THAT AVERAGE RATING OF THREE DOT

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:10.466 region:rollup2
SIX FIVE THAN JUST LOOKING AT

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:12.769 region:rollup2
PAUL RADER'S WHO AGREE.

WITH THOSE STATEMENTS QUE.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.972 region:rollup2
SO THEN THIS SAYS IN THE FIRST

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:17.306 region:rollup2
FLY THE LEGISLATURE CONSISTENTLY

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:18.674 region:rollup2

QUALITY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC IS

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:26.048 region:rollup2
A HIGH PRIORITY. 69% ARE THEY

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:28.484 region:rollup2
OUT THE THREE POINT SIX FIVE

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:30.853 region:rollup2
PLUS SOME IT WAS 69% RATED THAT

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:32.455 region:rollup2
A FOUR OR FIVE I GOT ANGRY OR I

STRONGLY AGREE WITH THAT GUY

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:39.362 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:41.297 region:rollup2
GOD.

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:49.438 region:rollup2
AND MY LAST QUESTION MADAM CHAIR

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:50.740 region:rollup2
IF I MAY IF THEY GOT A SLY.

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:52.575 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX ALL I APPRECIATE THE

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:54.043 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS OF AND I'M CLEAR

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:55.044 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF YOUR LANE BUT WHAT

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.145 region:rollup2
ROLE.

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:58.181 region:rollup2
YOU PLAY IN THIS PROCESS AND

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:59.749 region:rollup2
WHAT ROLE WE THAT PLAY IN TAKING

01:11:58.181 --> 01:12:01.717 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:03.286 region:rollup2
GLEANED FROM LEGISLATIVE STAFF

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:04.353 region:rollup2
AND DOING SOMETHING WITH IT.

01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:05.621 region:rollup2
WHICH IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:08.124 region:rollup2
THAT I HOPE THAT WE ARE

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:12.895 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO DO --

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:13.896 region:rollup2
AND SO I YOUR QUESTION THREE ARE

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:15.965 region:rollup2
YOU STATEMENT REFERRING TO

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:16.999 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:18.634 region:rollup2
THE STEPS INVOLVED IN THE

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.636 region:rollup2
PROPHECIES INCLUDING WHO WILL BE

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:22.438 region:rollup2
HANDLING COMPLAINTS IN ORDER TO

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:25.441 region:rollup2
MITIGATE FEAR OF RETALIATION.

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:28.311 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT.

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:30.513 region:rollup2
ONLY CLARITY ABOUT THE NEXT

01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:33.482 region:rollup2
STEPS ALONE CAN ACTUALLY

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:34.784 region:rollup2
MITIGATE FEAR MY SENSE IS.

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:36.419 region:rollup2
WHAT DRIVES THE FEE AROUND

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:38.321 region:rollup2
RETALIATION?

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:40.189 region:rollup2
IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN ME

01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:43.092 region:rollup2
JUST UNDERSTAND IN THE PROCESS

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:44.560 region:rollup2
AND WHO WILL DO WHAT NEXT.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:46.329 region:rollup2
SO COULD YOU EXPAND ON YOUR

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:49.098 region:rollup2
STATEMENT A LITTLE MORE.

01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:50.600 region:rollup2
YET IN THE DATA WE SAW THERE WAS

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:51.534 region:rollup2
A SENSE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.171 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A THERE WAS A RISK OF

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:55.638 region:rollup2
RETALIATION IF I WAS A REPORTER.

01:12:55.171 --> 01:12:57.206 region:rollup2
OR IF I EXPERIENCED.

01:12:55.638 --> 01:12:59.775 region:rollup2
SO.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:01.944 region:rollup2
HAVING TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHAT

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:04.046 region:rollup2
EXACTLY IS THE PROCESS WHAT CAN

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:05.748 region:rollup2
I EXPECT.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:06.949 region:rollup2
HAS A REPORTER OF EITHER

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:10.019 region:rollup2
WITNESSING OR EXPERIENCING

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:12.054 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT. TO HEAR BACK FROM

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:14.056 region:rollup2
WHOM BY WHEN.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:16.259 region:rollup2
WAS THE NET NATURE OF THE OF THE

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:18.294 region:rollup2
DATA THAT WE SAW AROUND THIS I

01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:21.163 region:rollup2
SO THE ABSENCE OF INFORMATION

01:13:18.294 --> 01:13:22.265 region:rollup2
CAN THEN KIND OF FUEL THAT SEE I

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:24.333 region:rollup2
KNEW I SHOULD THE TOLD THAT.

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:26.769 region:rollup2
AS OF THE ABSENCE OF INFORMATION

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:29.305 region:rollup2
I GUESS LIKE I GET YOU THEN

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:32.108 region:rollup2
FUELS THE FEAR BASED ON THAT

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:33.509 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KIND OF HAVE

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:34.877 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ITH YOURSELF YEAH

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:35.511 region:rollup2
OKAY AND SO THAT'S WHY I DID IT

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:35.845 region:rollup2
IS PROMOTION BECAUSE THAT GOES

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:38.514 region:rollup2
BACK TO THAT.

01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:40.883 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT THE

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:42.652 region:rollup2
NEXT STEPS WHERE I FOLLOW YOU.

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:43.919 region:rollup2
ALL I REALLY APPRECIATE OUT THE

01:13:42.652 --> 01:13:45.488 region:rollup2

I'M I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT --

01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:48.190 region:rollup2
STEP THAT THE LEGISLATURE TOOK

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.926 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF ENGAGING ALL

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:51.927 region:rollup2

AND ENGAGE THEMSELVES TALK WHY

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:55.331 region:rollup2
AM I HERE WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:56.932 region:rollup2
ME TO STAY HERE.

01:13:55.331 --> 01:13:57.967 region:rollup2
I DON'T GET IT IN EMPOWERS US

01:13:56.932 --> 01:14:00.870 region:rollup2
WITH -- THE

01:13:57.967 --> 01:14:03.806 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE.

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:05.574 region:rollup2
TO OUR EMPLOYEE PULL --

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:07.877 region:rollup2
TO BOTH MANAGE AND HELP

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:09.712 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH EXPECTATIONS --

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:12.448 region:rollup2
ALL OF US WANT TO WORK SOMEPLACE

WITH A PAY S. ARE.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:16.185 region:rollup2
PERCEPTION OF OUR OWN VALUE.

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:18.020 region:rollup2
EXCEPT EXCEPT ERA --

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:20.289 region:rollup2
AND SO TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.791 region:rollup2
THEIR WORKFORCE REALISTICALLY

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:23.993 region:rollup2
ABOUT AREAS WHERE THEY ARE

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:25.161 region:rollup2
FINITE RESOURCES BUT AREAS WHERE

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:26.262 region:rollup2
WE CAN STRETCH IT'S AN

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:27.663 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THEY PROVIDE

01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:30.700 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TRAINING.

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:33.703 region:rollup2
I AM SO PROUD TO SEE THE

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:35.404 region:rollup2
RESPONSES AROUND COWORKER MUTUAL

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:40.176 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR --

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:42.144 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:43.879 region:rollup2
A VERY TELLING.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:45.648 region:rollup2
AND WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE TO

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:48.351 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE GIVEN THE FACT QUITE

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:50.653 region:rollup2
FRANKLY THAT WE'VE PROVIDED.

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:52.221 region:rollup2
LIMITED SUPPORT TO OUR

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:54.757 region:rollup2

THAT THEY HAVE DONE.

01:14:56.258 --> 01:15:00.329 region:rollup2
AMAZING WORK WITH THE RESOURCES

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.797 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE GIVEN AND SO I

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:03.966 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE GAS.

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:05.968 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:07.937 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS TO CONTINUE --

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:09.605 region:rollup2
TO DO BETTER I LIKE THE RESET

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:11.207 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION AND I THINK THAT

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:12.575 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT.

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:14.543 region:rollup2
TO GIVE --

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:17.079 region:rollup2
INCLUDED THAT FIGURE OUT A WAY

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:19.582 region:rollup2
THAT WE NOT ONLY PROVIDE TREATED

01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:21.117 region:rollup2
TO EXISTING EMPLOYEES BUT HOW WE

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:23.519 region:rollup2
KIND OF STRATEGICALLY APPROACH

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:24.553 region:rollup2
HOW WE ON BOARD EMPLOYEES.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:27.256 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN A

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:30.593 region:rollup2
REAL --

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:32.328 region:rollup2
FOCUSED AREA FRANKLY OF OUR WORK

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:33.696 region:rollup2
BUT HOW WE ONBOARD NEW STAFF.

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:34.530 region:rollup2
ON IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:37.500 region:rollup2
IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:39.301 region:rollup2
WORK -- IT'S

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.436 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO WITH THAT AND AND I

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:47.176 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET IT GO AND

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.544 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUE TO UNDO ALL WE CAN

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:50.012 region:rollup2

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:39.295 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:40.162 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE FIRST THING WAS ALL

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:42.565 region:rollup2

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:44.333 region:rollup2
ON IN THE SO WE CAN MAKE THAT

01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:46.535 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:48.437 region:rollup2
WE DO KNOW THAT OUR STAFF GET

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.737 region:rollup2

[inaudible]

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:54.343 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS AND SINCE IT'S

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:54.877 region:rollup2

IN OTHER SURVEYS.

01:16:58.047 --> 01:17:01.750 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S AN INTERACTION WITH

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:04.119 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC THAT SUBSTANTIAL AS

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:07.957 region:rollup2
PART OF A ROLL YES [inaudible]

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:09.825 region:rollup2
SO THEN --

WE CALL IT JUST.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:20.736 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WHY WOULD IT BE ASKED.

01:17:19.668 --> 01:17:23.339 region:rollup2
USUALLY TO SEE HOW THE

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:24.840 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION IS SET UP TO HANDLE

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:26.809 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT COME FROM THAT

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.776 region:rollup2
INTERACTION ARE THERE PROCESSES

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.077 region:rollup2
IN PLACE TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:29.645 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:31.313 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.648 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FROM

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.516 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IF THAT'S

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:36.118 region:rollup2
PART OF THEIR ROLES AND

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:37.887 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:38.654 region:rollup2
AND IS IT USUALLY HIGHER THAN

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:40.589 region:rollup2
OTHER CATEGORIES IN OTHER

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:42.424 region:rollup2
SURVEYS.

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:45.194 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY NOT AT THIS LEVEL NOT

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:46.095 region:rollup2
NOT THIS HIGH.

01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:50.132 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DEVELOP A

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:51.767 region:rollup2
POLICY. TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:53.202 region:rollup2

DIFFERENT CATEGORIES.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:50.886 region:rollup2
BUT MANY OF OUR PEOPLE IN THERE

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:52.721 region:rollup2
THAT WAS HEAVILY SKEWED WITH

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:54.189 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEER RESPONSES COULD YOU

THEIR EMAIL THAT COULD HAVE

01:19:56.392 --> 01:19:59.828 region:rollup2
AFFECTED.

01:19:57.593 --> 01:20:00.996 region:rollup2
THE TREND I SEE THIS IS A TREND

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:02.097 region:rollup2
HERE IN TERMS THE WAY PEOPLE

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:03.065 region:rollup2
FEEL ABOUT.

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:07.269 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OUR INSTITUTIONS SO

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:07.936 region:rollup2
COULD YOU EXPLAIN.

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:09.538 region:rollup2

WHETHER.

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:12.441 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ON

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:15.377 region:rollup2
THE SURVEY WE DID REPUBLICANS

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:17.246 region:rollup2
DID NOT HAVE INPUT ON TYPICALLY

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:18.080 region:rollup2
SO WE DIDN'T HAVE A WAY. TO TO

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:18.914 region:rollup2
MEASURE THAT WHEN WE WERE

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.749 region:rollup2
REVIEWING THIS BEFORE TODAY'S

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:22.217 region:rollup2
MEETING.

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:24.353 region:rollup2
SO IN THE FINDINGS THAT WE

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:26.555 region:rollup2

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:27.523 region:rollup2
GROUP OVER ANOTHER SO WAS SUCH

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:30.192 region:rollup2
TOTAL.

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:32.061 region:rollup2
AVERAGE OF ALL RESPONDENTS.

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:34.096 region:rollup2
SO THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE

01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:36.732 region:rollup2
WORKED OR BEEN PRESENT.

01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:37.299 region:rollup2
IN ON THE LEGISLATURE FOR A YEAR

01:20:36.732 --> 01:20:39.334 region:rollup2

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:41.203 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:43.172 region:rollup2
IN THE DATA.

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:44.006 region:rollup2
WE WE SENT ONE TO THREE YEARS

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:46.075 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR LOSS COUNT.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:47.576 region:rollup2
YET WE RECEIVED A FILE FROM THE

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:49.978 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WITH EMPLOYEES AND

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:51.246 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DID NOT PARKS THAT FILE.

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:53.048 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE TOOK THE FILE THAT WAS

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:55.184 region:rollup2
PROVIDED AN I DON'T KNOW THE

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:57.019 region:rollup2
EXACT CRITERIA AS TO WHO WAS

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.586 region:rollup2
INCLUDED.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:59.288 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN THE FILE THAT WE

01:20:57.586 --> 01:21:01.356 region:rollup2
RECEIVED I ONLY MENTION IT

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:02.624 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THE ME TOO

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.325 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT BEING SO.

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.760 region:rollup2
SO.

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:05.794 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PREVALENT DURING THE

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.429 region:rollup2
CLIMATE SURVEY.

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:09.331 region:rollup2
AND THE FOLKS THAT WERE

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:12.468 region:rollup2
RESPONDING OFF HAD ON FEWER

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:13.736 region:rollup2
YEARS HERE THAT RESPONDED OF YOU

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:14.369 region:rollup2
KNOW AND MORE NUMBERS STAND

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:15.938 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO'VE BEEN HERE A NUMBER

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:17.606 region:rollup2
OF YEARS --

01:21:15.938 --> 01:21:18.907 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:21.677 region:rollup2
THAT TOO BECAUSE THERE COULD BE

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:23.011 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIONS OUR PERCEPTIONS.

01:21:21.677 --> 01:21:24.980 region:rollup2
ALL THAT ARE NECESSARILY --

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:26.482 region:rollup2
THAT ACCURATE NOT I THINK IT'S A

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.382 region:rollup2
GREAT SERVICE THINK IT SHOWS

01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:29.885 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY TRANSCEND IT HELPS

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:30.319 region:rollup2
THOSE I THINK AS WE LOOK AT THE

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:32.054 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT ARE IN

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:33.922 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:36.492 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST WANT TO GET NOW WHEN

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:37.993 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT 50% OF THE PEOPLE

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:39.161 region:rollup2
THAT WORK HERE DID RESPOND.

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:41.530 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:42.831 region:rollup2
AN INDICATION THAT NEITHER WE

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:44.299 region:rollup2
ARE COMMUNICATING WELL OF THE

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:45.734 region:rollup2
DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GOING ON

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:48.470 region:rollup2
AND HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS. TO THE

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:50.239 region:rollup2
POLICIES ARE DEVELOPING.

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:52.007 region:rollup2
THE OTHER RESPONSE RATE AGAIN IT

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:53.041 region:rollup2
46% IS IN THE RANGE OF WHAT WE

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:55.010 region:rollup2
WOULD EXPECT WITH A SURVEY OF

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:57.479 region:rollup2
THIS NATURE.

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:59.414 region:rollup2
SO IT'S ABOUT RANGERS 3250% SO

01:21:57.479 --> 01:22:00.582 region:rollup2
WE'RE ACTUALLY THE TOP END OF

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:03.786 region:rollup2
THAT RANGE TO THINK IS A VERY

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:04.753 region:rollup2
HEALTHY SIGN.

01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:06.522 region:rollup2
AND IF I MIGHT JUST TO GET

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:08.023 region:rollup2
CLARITY SENATOR ARE YOU --

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:09.892 region:rollup2
ARE YOU.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:11.593 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT WE

01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:13.695 region:rollup2
HAD MORE OF THE SHORTER TERM

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:14.463 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES RESPONDING THE LONGER

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.464 region:rollup2
TERM BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT

01:22:14.463 --> 01:22:16.098 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT.

01:22:15.464 --> 01:22:17.232 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE PART

01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:18.934 region:rollup2
JUST I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE

ENGAGEMENT AND YOUR INTEREST --

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:42.184 region:rollup2
I SAW COMMERCIAL A LAST NIGHT --

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:45.086 region:rollup2
ON TV I THINK IT WAS OUT THE AD

01:28:42.184 --> 01:28:46.188 region:rollup2
AND THE TAGLINE WAS PROGRESS IS

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:47.889 region:rollup2
NEVER STANDING STILL.

01:28:46.188 --> 01:28:49.958 region:rollup2
ON THAT I THINK OUR ON GOING

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:51.726 region:rollup2
WORK IN THIS AREA ON BEHALF OF

01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:52.260 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.662 region:rollup2
ON OUR ENTIRE LEGISLATIVE

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:55.730 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY ON THIS REFLECTIVE IN

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:57.032 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:28:55.730 --> 01:29:00.001 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT AT LEGISLATIVE OR

01:28:57.032 --> 01:29:01.369 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT PROCESS A WE ENGAGED

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:03.605 region:rollup2
MONTHS AGO NOW AND SAY THE

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:05.340 region:rollup2
POLICY FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE

01:29:03.605 --> 01:29:07.943 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S NEXT STEPS IN

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:10.612 region:rollup2
REFRAMING OUR INSTITUTIONAL.

01:29:07.943 --> 01:29:11.780 region:rollup2
CULTURE BASED ON VALUES.

01:29:10.612 --> 01:29:14.015 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:16.451 region:rollup2
DELIBERATE TO HAVE --

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:19.054 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE CLEAR THAT WE

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:20.722 region:rollup2
CANNOT MICROMANAGE --

01:29:19.054 --> 01:29:22.157 region:rollup2
OUR GOAL IN OUR ROLE AS

01:29:20.722 --> 01:29:25.760 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS IS TO ESTABLISH

01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:27.462 region:rollup2
POLICY AND OUR INTENT.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.763 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT IMPORTANT ROLE WE

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:31.499 region:rollup2
PLAY AS BOTH EMPLOYERS AND

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:34.069 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES OF THE PUBLIC THAT HAS

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:35.870 region:rollup2
GUIDED OUR APPROACH SHOULD BE

01:29:34.069 --> 01:29:37.839 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALLY DELIBERATIVE.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:40.942 region:rollup2
WE APPROACH THIS FROM A BALANCED

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:41.977 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THE REALITY

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:43.812 region:rollup2
IS WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS

01:29:41.977 --> 01:29:46.348 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK.

01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:48.216 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDST OF CLAIMS FIELD BY

01:29:46.348 --> 01:29:50.385 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INTERESTS.

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:51.653 region:rollup2
SCRUTINY AND FEAR.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:53.688 region:rollup2
FEAR FROM FELL LEGISLATORS HERE

01:29:51.653 --> 01:29:55.924 region:rollup2
FROM STAFF --

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:58.093 region:rollup2
FEAR FROM EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.

01:29:55.924 --> 01:30:00.395 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS REALLY THE FRAMEWORK

01:29:58.093 --> 01:30:02.497 region:rollup2
FROM WHICH I APPROACH THIS WORK

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:04.900 region:rollup2
AND WE WORKED COLLABORATIVELY --

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:05.934 region:rollup2
INTO BY CAMEL WAY THAT TOO CAN

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.936 region:rollup2
BE A CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:30:05.934 --> 01:30:08.904 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE PRACTICED REGULARLY

01:30:07.936 --> 01:30:09.971 region:rollup2
IN THIS PLACE WE AB ASSEMBLY OF

01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:11.306 region:rollup2
THE SENATE WE DO OUR SEPARATE

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:13.308 region:rollup2
BUSINESS.

01:30:11.306 --> 01:30:15.677 region:rollup2
AND SO TO TO PRACTICE A

01:30:13.308 --> 01:30:17.812 region:rollup2
BICAMERAL STRATEGY IN DEVELOPING

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:19.281 region:rollup2
THIS APPROACH WAS EQUALLY AS

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:22.517 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ON

01:30:19.281 --> 01:30:24.286 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF SHOWING THE EXAMPLE

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:24.853 region:rollup2

LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS IT --

01:30:33.628 --> 01:30:37.232 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M PROUD OF THE WORK --

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:39.200 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE PUT INTO IT BOTH THE

01:30:37.232 --> 01:30:41.703 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND THE OUTCOME.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:43.238 region:rollup2

IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK ND SO

01:32:22.604 --> 01:32:26.708 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE CULTURE IS IS IS

01:32:24.339 --> 01:32:29.577 region:rollup2

WORKPLACE HARASSMENT

01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:38.787 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION WILL CHANGE AND

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:39.554 region:rollup2
EVERY CHANGE IS DONE WITH AN EYE

01:32:38.787 --> 01:32:43.525 region:rollup2

OF RESPECTABILITY IN DIVERSITY

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:50.131 region:rollup2
AND I WILL POINT OUT THAT THIS

01:32:48.463 --> 01:32:51.533 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:53.034 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE HARASSMENT.

01:32:51.533 --> 01:32:54.502 region:rollup2
WE SEE THIS TO THIS DISCUSSION

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:56.137 region:rollup2
GOING ON ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:57.439 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COMING

01:32:56.137 --> 01:32:58.206 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE

01:32:57.439 --> 01:32:59.541 region:rollup2
BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME

01:32:58.206 --> 01:33:01.242 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND RISK WHATEVER

01:32:59.541 --> 01:33:02.644 region:rollup2
RETALIATION THEY MIGHT.

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.878 region:rollup2
HAVE AND WE HAVE TO THANK THEM

01:33:02.644 --> 01:33:06.214 region:rollup2
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WITH

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:06.481 region:rollup2
THIS THAT'S NOT UNIQUE TO OUR

01:33:06.214 --> 01:33:07.482 region:rollup2
CULTURE.

01:33:06.481 --> 01:33:08.983 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE

01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:10.351 region:rollup2
TO OUR CULTURE AND TO MANY OTHER

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:11.920 region:rollup2
CULTURES WILL WE SEE A LOT OF US

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:13.621 region:rollup2
OF HARASSMENT.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.223 region:rollup2
IS A VERY LARGE IMBALANCE

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:17.425 region:rollup2
BETWEEN POWER.

01:33:15.223 --> 01:33:19.127 region:rollup2
OF SOME MEMBERS OF OUR WORK

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:20.829 region:rollup2
FORCE AND OTHERS OF COURSE WITH

01:33:19.127 --> 01:33:22.931 region:rollup2
MEMBERS AND SENIOR STAFF AT THE

01:33:20.829 --> 01:33:24.799 region:rollup2
TOP OF THAT HIERARCHY.

01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:26.768 region:rollup2
INTERNS AND YEAH I'M --

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:28.403 region:rollup2
ENTRY LEVEL STUFF POSSIBLY BEING

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:30.371 region:rollup2
SEEN AS BEING ON THE BOTTOM.

01:33:28.403 --> 01:33:31.940 region:rollup2
AND THAT AS WE HEARD FROM MANY

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:33.074 region:rollup2
EXPERTS IS WHERE YOU YOU KNOW

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:35.310 region:rollup2
TEND TO RUN INTO A LOT OF

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:36.578 region:rollup2
TROUBLE SO HOW DO WE REALIZING

01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:38.546 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE

01:33:36.578 --> 01:33:40.315 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY DEVELOP THAT CULTURE

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:41.149 region:rollup2
OF RESPECTABILITY IN DIVERSITY.

01:33:40.315 --> 01:33:44.986 region:rollup2
SO THAT EVERYBODY IS VALUED

01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:45.987 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY TOLERATE HARASSMENT

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:48.623 region:rollup2
TOWARDS ANYBODY AND WE HAVE A

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:49.991 region:rollup2
WAY OF HAVING A AN ABILITY.

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:51.593 region:rollup2
SO EXPANDING REPORTING AN

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:53.495 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT ADDRESSING

01:33:51.593 --> 01:33:55.530 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS EARLY IS GOING TO BE A

01:33:53.495 --> 01:33:56.831 region:rollup2
BIG PART OF THE SOLUTION.

01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:58.633 region:rollup2
I'M ALSO GOING TO BE SUED

01:33:56.831 --> 01:34:00.201 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING THAT WE CREATE FOR

01:33:58.633 --> 01:34:01.903 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME AN INDEPENDENT

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:03.471 region:rollup2
BICAMERAL UNIT.

01:34:01.903 --> 01:34:05.306 region:rollup2
WITH AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:07.408 region:rollup2
EXPERTS TO MAKE FACTUAL FINDINGS

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:08.443 region:rollup2
AND RECOMMENDATIONS SO MOVING ON

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:09.777 region:rollup2
A DRILLING DOWN MORE

01:34:08.443 --> 01:34:11.279 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY INTO EACH OF THOSE

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:12.780 region:rollup2
AREAS.

01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:14.215 region:rollup2
I'M THE FIRST AREA IS TO

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:15.817 region:rollup2
TRANSFORM THE LEGISLATORS

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:17.552 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE CULTURE TO PROMOTE

01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:18.453 region:rollup2
RESPECT CIVILITY IN DIVERSITY.

01:34:17.552 --> 01:34:19.454 region:rollup2
AND EVERY PERSON'S

01:34:18.453 --> 01:34:20.889 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD ON THAT

01:34:19.454 --> 01:34:22.223 region:rollup2
CULTURE.

01:34:20.889 --> 01:34:23.992 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO BE ADOPTING A

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:25.960 region:rollup2
MORE FORMAL.

01:34:30.732 --> 01:34:34.269 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.870 region:rollup2
TOWARDS OTHERS BASED ON

01:34:34.269 --> 01:34:36.504 region:rollup2
PROTECTED CLASS SO IT DOESN'T

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:38.006 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT THERE CAN'T BE OTHER

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:39.307 region:rollup2
KINDS OF HARASSMENT THAT WOULD

01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:41.109 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL HR

01:34:39.307 --> 01:34:43.244 region:rollup2

BASED ON PROTECTED CLASS

01:34:46.581 --> 01:34:48.983 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:50.785 region:rollup2

I AM DISABILITY AND SEXUAL

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:56.524 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION WHAT ARE ALL THE

01:34:54.622 --> 01:35:00.061 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THAT POLICY --

01:34:56.524 --> 01:35:02.597 region:rollup2

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:12.507 region:rollup2
AS WE HEARD FROM OUR SURVEY.

01:35:10.572 --> 01:35:14.976 region:rollup2
I'M THE FIRST STEP IS TO CREATE

01:35:12.507 --> 01:35:16.644 region:rollup2
AN ENGAGING TRAINING PROGRAM WE

01:35:14.976 --> 01:35:17.946 region:rollup2
HEARD OVER AND OVER THAT EVEN

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:19.147 region:rollup2
THOUGH WE'VE HAD A TRAINING

COMPLIES WITH WHAT'S DONE AROUND

01:35:20.782 --> 01:35:23.585 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY AND IS VERY TYPICAL

01:35:21.783 --> 01:35:25.186 region:rollup2
IN SOME WAYS GOES BEYOND.

01:35:23.585 --> 01:35:26.621 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF OTHER

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:28.856 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS DO?

01:35:26.621 --> 01:35:30.124 region:rollup2
WE WANT A TRAINING POLICY THAT

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:32.560 region:rollup2
IS MUCH MORE ENGAGING.

01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:34.062 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE INTERACTIVE --

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:36.331 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY INVOLVING NEW

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:37.465 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES ALL OF THAT WILL BE

01:35:36.331 --> 01:35:39.200 region:rollup2
EXPLORED BUT THE DIRECTION TO

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:40.034 region:rollup2
STOCK WILL BE. TO CREATE

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.003 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S A LOT MORE

01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:43.972 region:rollup2
GEARED TOWARDS OUR UNIQUE FOR

01:35:42.003 --> 01:35:45.340 region:rollup2

DISTRICT --

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:51.479 region:rollup2
AND A WAY THAT THE DISTRICT WORK

01:35:50.278 --> 01:35:53.047 region:rollup2
SIX SUCH A SODA EVERYBODY

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:57.185 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS.

01:35:53.047 --> 01:35:59.487 region:rollup2
THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEIR

01:35:57.185 --> 01:36:03.391 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS IN THE BUILDING BUT

01:35:59.487 --> 01:36:04.959 region:rollup2
ALSO OUT IN THE FIELD.

01:36:03.391 --> 01:36:06.694 region:rollup2
I ALSO JUST ADD AGAIN THAT WE

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:08.062 region:rollup2
CAN BUILD ON WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:09.764 region:rollup2

RELY ON EACH OTHER.

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:16.371 region:rollup2
I'M WE WILL ALSO FIND WAYS TO

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:19.641 region:rollup2
PROMOTE RESPECT AND CIVILITY IN

01:36:16.371 --> 01:36:22.710 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATIVE WORKPLACE --

01:36:19.641 --> 01:36:23.344 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT GOOD

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:24.912 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR AND FIND WAYS TO REWARD

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:26.414 region:rollup2
IT.

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:26.714 region:rollup2
WE WILL PROTECT EMPLOYEES

01:36:26.414 --> 01:36:29.917 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:31.252 region:rollup2
WHO REPORT INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:33.688 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:35.456 region:rollup2
STRONG ANTI RETALIATION

01:36:33.688 --> 01:36:36.791 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES AND THAT IF?

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:38.826 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DO FEEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:40.361 region:rollup2
RETALIATED AGAINST MAKING GO TO

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.895 region:rollup2
THE PANEL WHO UNDERSTANDS THE

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:42.764 region:rollup2
CASE YOU KNOW IN THE FIRST

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:44.732 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:36:42.764 --> 01:36:46.534 region:rollup2
AND REPORT THAT RETALIATION AND

01:36:44.732 --> 01:36:48.903 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A PATH TO JUSTICE SO

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:50.505 region:rollup2
THAT WE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT.

01:36:48.903 --> 01:36:54.409 region:rollup2
IN EVERY WAY RETALIATION WILL

01:36:50.505 --> 01:36:55.743 region:rollup2
NOT BE TOLERATED.

01:36:54.409 --> 01:36:57.078 region:rollup2
THEN IT MOVING ONTO ADDRESSING

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:58.813 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS EARLY AND I THINK THAT

01:36:57.078 --> 01:37:00.248 region:rollup2
THIS IS KEY IN THIS IS A BIG

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:04.118 region:rollup2
CHANGE FROM WHAT HAPPENS NOW.

01:37:00.248 --> 01:37:05.153 region:rollup2
WE WOULD LIKE [inaudible] TO

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:07.588 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYEES

01:37:05.153 --> 01:37:09.857 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT WE WOULD LIKE

01:37:07.588 --> 01:37:11.259 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT REPORTED.

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:11.759 region:rollup2
EVEN IF IT'S A FIRST TIME

01:37:11.259 --> 01:37:14.062 region:rollup2
OFFENSE EVEN IF IT'S ONE

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:15.997 region:rollup2
COMMENT.

01:37:14.062 --> 01:37:17.532 region:rollup2
ONE IMAGE ONE JOKE AND THE

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:19.701 region:rollup2
REASON IS NOT TO BE PUNITIVE TO

01:37:17.532 --> 01:37:21.502 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES OR PUNISH EMPLOYEES IS

01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:23.805 region:rollup2
TO INTERVENE EARLY TO OFFER

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:25.340 region:rollup2
COUNSELING AND OFFER TRAINING

01:37:23.805 --> 01:37:26.808 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONE COMMENT MIGHT NOT.

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.842 region:rollup2
MEAN VERY MUCH OR SEEN

01:37:26.808 --> 01:37:29.143 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:32.513 region:rollup2
BUT IF IF THAT BEHAVIOR

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:33.081 region:rollup2
CONTINUES AND NOW YOU HAVE TEN

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:35.516 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY OF THOSE SAME

01:37:33.081 --> 01:37:37.452 region:rollup2
KINDS OF INCIDENCES NOT ONLY DO

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:37.952 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ARE PERHAPS I'LL A

01:37:37.452 --> 01:37:39.120 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE THAT DOES HAVE

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:41.322 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.157 region:rollup2
BUT NOW THAT EMPLOYEE HAS

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:44.759 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY CROSSED A LINE TO THE

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:45.827 region:rollup2
LEGAL DEFINITION OF SEXUAL

01:37:44.759 --> 01:37:47.495 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT WORDS IF WE'D

01:37:45.827 --> 01:37:48.963 region:rollup2
INTERVENE EARLY WE COULD HAVE

01:37:47.495 --> 01:37:51.399 region:rollup2
CORRECTED THAT PATH.

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:53.101 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT PERSON

01:37:51.399 --> 01:37:54.569 region:rollup2
I'M UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES

01:37:53.101 --> 01:37:56.671 region:rollup2
OF THEIR BEHAVIOR.

01:37:54.569 --> 01:37:58.840 region:rollup2
I IN A WAY THAT.

01:37:56.671 --> 01:38:01.376 region:rollup2
IS PROTECTIVE OF THAT PERSON AS

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:03.144 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE

01:38:01.376 --> 01:38:05.546 region:rollup2
INTERACTING WITH SO WE CAN.

01:38:03.144 --> 01:38:07.415 region:rollup2
INTERVENE EARLY COUNSEL EARLY WE

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:08.950 region:rollup2
CAN PROTECT PEOPLE'S JOBS AND

01:38:07.415 --> 01:38:09.817 region:rollup2
HAVE A BETTER WORK ENVIRONMENT

01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:12.320 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:15.189 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE EXPECT IN

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:17.992 region:rollup2
TERMS OF CONDUCT TOWARDS OTHERS.

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:20.228 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT GOAL WE WILL CREATE

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:21.429 region:rollup2
A WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT THAT'S

01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:23.030 region:rollup2
THE UNIT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:38:21.429 --> 01:38:25.366 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BICAMERAL UNIT WERE

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:27.668 region:rollup2
REPORTS OF THAT NATURE CAN.

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:30.037 region:rollup2
GO I WILL ALSO HAVE TO TRAIN OUR

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:31.739 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES THAT WE EXPECT AND WE

01:38:30.037 --> 01:38:33.341 region:rollup2
WANT THEM TO REPORT.

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:35.610 region:rollup2
THOSE INFRACTIONS THOSE

01:38:33.341 --> 01:38:37.044 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OF WORKPLACE CONDUCT

01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:38.713 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

01:38:37.044 --> 01:38:40.948 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE HELD AGAINST YOU WE

01:38:38.713 --> 01:38:42.183 region:rollup2
WANT TO INCREASE THE REPORTING

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:43.618 region:rollup2
OF THOSE VIOLATIONS THAT WE

01:38:42.183 --> 01:38:45.353 region:rollup2
CAN'T INTERVENE EARLY AND THAT'S

01:38:43.618 --> 01:38:45.653 region:rollup2
GOING TO TAKE TRAINING OF OUR

01:38:45.353 --> 01:38:46.721 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:48.856 region:rollup2

PART SUPERVISORS AND OTHERS WILL

01:38:55.563 --> 01:38:58.966 region:rollup2
BE ENCOURAGED TO REPORT THAT

01:38:57.198 --> 01:38:59.801 region:rollup2
WILL BE WHAT WE EXPECT THEM TO

01:38:58.966 --> 01:39:01.402 region:rollup2
DO.

01:38:59.801 --> 01:39:03.137 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE THAT ONCE THAT

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:04.872 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS OUT THERE THE

01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:05.373 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT.

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:07.542 region:rollup2

OF COURSE WILL SORT OF MOVE UP

01:39:57.458 --> 01:39:59.760 region:rollup2
ON THAT SCALE AND OTHER THINGS

01:39:58.526 --> 01:40:01.162 region:rollup2

01:46:26.814 --> 01:46:31.318 region:rollup2
WE EXPECT THE SAME IF NOT BETTER

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.152 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR HERE FROM LEGISLATORS

01:46:35.456 --> 01:46:37.992 region:rollup2
BE TREATING US IN MAKING THE

01:46:36.924 --> 01:46:39.059 region:rollup2
SAME RECOMMENDATIONS AS THEY

01:46:37.992 --> 01:46:40.461 region:rollup2
WOULD FOR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:42.730 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS

01:46:40.461 --> 01:46:45.799 region:rollup2
BASED ON WHAT OUR POLICY IS AND

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:48.402 region:rollup2
WHAT THE LAW IS.

01:46:45.799 --> 01:46:50.237 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN TO THE

01:46:48.402 --> 01:46:52.773 region:rollup2
TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:54.341 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ARE SENATOR LEYVA.

01:46:52.773 --> 01:46:55.476 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'D FIRST

01:46:55.476 --> 01:46:58.579 region:rollup2
VICE CHAIR THIS WAS A LOT OF

01:46:57.044 --> 01:46:59.213 region:rollup2
WORK AND TO ALL THE COMMITTEE

01:46:58.579 --> 01:47:01.548 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

01:46:59.213 --> 01:47:04.451 region:rollup2
AND BUT HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

01:47:01.548 --> 01:47:06.420 region:rollup2
IT IS AND I THINK HOW BEING.

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:07.988 region:rollup2
POLICIES IN PLACE SINCE I WAS

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:10.724 region:rollup2
ELECTED FOUR YEARS AGO SOMETHING

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:12.293 region:rollup2
HAS ALWAYS STRUCK ME IS THAT.

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:14.595 region:rollup2
WERE LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:47:12.293 --> 01:47:16.363 region:rollup2
LITTLE SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO

01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:19.867 region:rollup2
MANY OUT FOLKS WERE ELECTED

01:47:16.363 --> 01:47:21.835 region:rollup2
NEVER HAD A STAFF BEFORE AND SO

01:47:19.867 --> 01:47:23.470 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PRACTICING IF YOU WILL

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:24.104 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR STAFF THAT THEY HAVE

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:25.773 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:27.441 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK ANYONE EVER STARTS

01:47:25.773 --> 01:47:29.777 region:rollup2
OUT WITH BAD INTENTIONS BUT

01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:31.011 region:rollup2
PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW SO I

01:47:29.777 --> 01:47:32.579 region:rollup2
THINK HAVING A FRAMEWORK AND

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:34.148 region:rollup2
HAVING IT BE BY CAMEL THAT WAS

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:35.082 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE THAT STRUCK ME

01:47:34.148 --> 01:47:37.084 region:rollup2
WAS WHEN I WAS ELECTED.

01:47:35.082 --> 01:47:38.652 region:rollup2
HOW WE DO THINGS SO SEPARATELY

01:47:37.084 --> 01:47:40.421 region:rollup2
EVEN THE WORD ENDEAVORING TO

01:47:38.652 --> 01:47:41.755 region:rollup2
CREATE LAWS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE

01:47:40.421 --> 01:47:42.957 region:rollup2
TOGETHER SO I THINK IT'S

01:47:41.755 --> 01:47:45.192 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE

01:47:42.957 --> 01:47:47.094 region:rollup2
DOING THIS AS A BY CAMEL UNIT?

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:48.929 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THE FUTURE IS

01:47:47.094 --> 01:47:50.431 region:rollup2
BRIGHT I THINK THAT THE THAT

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:51.598 region:rollup2
RESULTS FROM THE SURVEY WERE

01:47:50.431 --> 01:47:54.001 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY NOT --

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:57.204 region:rollup2
AS BAD AS I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT

01:47:54.001 --> 01:47:57.972 region:rollup2
[inaudible] TO DO AND I ALSO TO

01:47:57.204 --> 01:48:00.140 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON WHAT SENATOR MITCHELL

01:47:57.972 --> 01:48:01.608 region:rollup2
SAID I THINK THAT --

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:04.812 region:rollup2
WE ALWAYS WANT MORE PEOPLE TO

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:06.680 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE BUT THAT IS OUR

01:48:04.812 --> 01:48:08.649 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE FOR EVER WHEN WE LOOK

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.117 region:rollup2
AT THE APATHY IN SOCIETY PEOPLE

01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:11.852 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT VOTE SO GETTING

01:48:10.117 --> 01:48:13.354 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO FILL OUT A SURVEY

01:48:11.852 --> 01:48:14.521 region:rollup2
ISN'T ALWAYS GOING TO BE EASY

01:48:13.354 --> 01:48:15.756 region:rollup2
BUT WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO KEEP

01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:17.358 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD.

01:48:15.756 --> 01:48:18.492 region:rollup2

01:48:19.994 --> 01:48:24.198 region:rollup2
VITAL WORK AND I THINK THESE ARE

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:25.566 region:rollup2
REAL STEPS THAT ARE GONNA MOVE

01:48:24.198 --> 01:48:30.003 region:rollup2

WHICH WE ALL AGREED WE NEED.

01:49:04.571 --> 01:49:07.441 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THAT CULTURE CHANGED

01:49:05.606 --> 01:49:08.909 region:rollup2

WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A PROCESS

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:13.981 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN PLACE THAT TOM

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:16.150 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:49:13.981 --> 01:49:17.551 region:rollup2
OUR EMPLOYEES.

WE CAN TRUST THE PROCESS AND SO

01:49:20.421 --> 01:49:24.892 region:rollup2
--

01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:27.561 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE WHEN I SEE THAT THAT

01:49:24.892 --> 01:49:28.429 region:rollup2
THAT RETAIN THEIR WHAT THE THE

01:49:27.561 --> 01:49:29.563 region:rollup2
ONE WHICH HAS RETAIN HOUSE

01:49:28.429 --> 01:49:31.065 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE

01:49:29.563 --> 01:49:32.366 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE SO I WOULD

01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:34.501 region:rollup2

AND SAT DOWN AND I REALLY --

01:49:42.242 --> 01:49:45.913 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY HAVE A GREAT SYSTEM

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:47.081 region:rollup2
THERE AND YEAH IT'S DIFFERENT

01:49:45.913 --> 01:49:49.116 region:rollup2
FROM THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:49:47.081 --> 01:49:50.617 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE HERE BECAUSE IT'S A

01:49:49.116 --> 01:49:51.618 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT SO YOU

01:49:50.617 --> 01:49:53.320 region:rollup2
KNOW THEY HAVE A HUNDRED

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:54.655 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EMPLOYEES.

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:56.423 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT SUPERVISORS IN

01:49:54.655 --> 01:49:58.459 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS.

01:49:56.423 --> 01:50:00.561 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALSO HAVE OF FIVE

01:49:58.459 --> 01:50:02.529 region:rollup2
PERSON BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT

01:50:00.561 --> 01:50:03.664 region:rollup2
IS AT THE TOP AYE I GUESS IS THE

01:50:02.529 --> 01:50:04.765 region:rollup2
LACK DID AND THEN THEY HAVE YOU

01:50:03.664 --> 01:50:06.300 region:rollup2
KNOW MANY --

01:50:04.765 --> 01:50:07.801 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES THAT ARE

01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:09.269 region:rollup2
IN THERE COUNTY THAT ARE HAVE

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:10.704 region:rollup2
ELECTED POSITIONS TO BUT IT IS

01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:12.005 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN.

01:50:10.704 --> 01:50:15.809 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE HAVE A

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:17.277 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY AS A SENATOR

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:18.645 region:rollup2
LEYVA IT.

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:20.114 region:rollup2
SAID DIFFERENT BUSINESSES

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:22.082 region:rollup2
BASICALLY AND AHEAD OF THAT IS

01:50:20.114 --> 01:50:23.383 region:rollup2
EACH ELECTED.

01:50:22.082 --> 01:50:25.285 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE SO IT'S IT IS

01:50:23.383 --> 01:50:28.188 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:50:25.285 --> 01:50:31.225 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO CRAFT THE POLICY

01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:33.794 region:rollup2
THAT -- HAS

01:50:31.225 --> 01:50:36.430 region:rollup2
TRUST AND HAS SOME.

01:50:33.794 --> 01:50:38.398 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO BE ABLE.

01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:39.266 region:rollup2
TO BRING ALL THE PEOPLE TO THE

01:50:38.398 --> 01:50:41.268 region:rollup2
TABLE AND IT IN AND IN A WAY

01:50:39.266 --> 01:50:41.869 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:50:41.268 --> 01:50:43.303 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

01:50:41.869 --> 01:50:45.806 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:48.108 region:rollup2
ON IT AT THAT PROCESS IS NOT IS

01:50:45.806 --> 01:50:49.576 region:rollup2
FAIL PROOF SO IT WENT WHEN I HAD

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:50.711 region:rollup2
LIKE A LITTLE MORE CLARIFICATION

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:53.080 region:rollup2
ON HOW YOU.

01:50:50.711 --> 01:50:54.481 region:rollup2
SEE THIS PANEL OPERATING AND

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.749 region:rollup2
THEN IF SOMEBODY CAME FOR WHAT

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:57.251 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE FINAL OUTCOME OF

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:57.417 region:rollup2
THAT PANEL ON HOW HOW WOULD THAT

01:50:57.251 --> 01:51:01.421 region:rollup2
BE.

01:50:57.417 --> 01:51:02.356 region:rollup2
HANDLED.

01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:05.025 region:rollup2
WELL I WILL SAY FIRST THAT

01:51:02.356 --> 01:51:05.559 region:rollup2
GAINING TRUST I'M.

01:51:05.025 --> 01:51:07.261 region:rollup2
WERE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE

01:51:05.559 --> 01:51:07.828 region:rollup2
TRUST.

01:51:07.261 --> 01:51:09.463 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES WE

01:51:07.828 --> 01:51:11.331 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:51:09.463 --> 01:51:12.900 region:rollup2
DON'T DON'T TRUST US THAT'S

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:14.134 region:rollup2
GONNA TAKE TIME AND THERE'S NO

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:17.171 region:rollup2
POLICY WE'RE GOING TO PUT INTO

01:51:14.134 --> 01:51:19.373 region:rollup2
PLACE THAT'S GOING TO OVERNIGHT.

01:51:17.171 --> 01:51:21.608 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT SO --

01:51:19.373 --> 01:51:23.877 region:rollup2
BUTTON I THINK YOU SEEN MAJOR

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:25.312 region:rollup2
STEPS BEING TAKEN IS THE FIRST

01:51:23.877 --> 01:51:27.681 region:rollup2
STEP TOWARDS GETTING TRUST.

01:51:25.312 --> 01:51:29.016 region:rollup2
SEEING US PUT POLICIES INTO

01:51:27.681 --> 01:51:30.751 region:rollup2
PLACE THAT WE'RE WILLING TO BE

01:51:29.016 --> 01:51:33.820 region:rollup2
SUBJECTED.

01:51:30.751 --> 01:51:36.123 region:rollup2
TO AND THAT --

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:37.157 region:rollup2
STARTS TO WORK.

01:51:36.123 --> 01:51:38.692 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL HAVE TO CUT WILL

01:51:37.157 --> 01:51:40.227 region:rollup2
HAVE TO EVALUATE YOU KNOW AS WE

01:51:38.692 --> 01:51:41.862 region:rollup2
PUT THIS INTO PLACE IT'S NOT

01:51:40.227 --> 01:51:43.063 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ONE AND DONE YOU

01:51:41.862 --> 01:51:43.664 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE

01:51:43.063 --> 01:51:44.698 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:51:43.664 --> 01:51:45.999 region:rollup2
NEED.

01:51:44.698 --> 01:51:47.434 region:rollup2
TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON WE'RE

01:51:45.999 --> 01:51:49.403 region:rollup2
PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO TWEAK

01:51:47.434 --> 01:51:51.405 region:rollup2
IT FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT --

01:51:49.403 --> 01:51:52.773 region:rollup2
WE'LL DO A CULTURE SURVEY MAYBE

01:51:51.405 --> 01:51:54.575 region:rollup2
SIX MONTHS AFTER WE INSTITUTE

01:51:52.773 --> 01:51:55.175 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES AND GET A SENSE OF

01:51:54.575 --> 01:51:56.777 region:rollup2
OUR EMPLOYEES HOW IT'S WORKING

01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:59.980 region:rollup2
--

01:51:56.777 --> 01:52:01.348 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WILL TAKE TIME.

01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:01.949 region:rollup2
I IN TERMS OF HOW THE PANEL

01:52:01.348 --> 01:52:05.385 region:rollup2
WORKS IT'S MY HOPE [inaudible]

01:52:01.949 --> 01:52:07.521 region:rollup2
THAT SUPERVISORS AND OTHERS IN

01:52:05.385 --> 01:52:09.323 region:rollup2
THE DECISION MAKING POSITIONS

01:52:07.521 --> 01:52:11.325 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

01:52:09.323 --> 01:52:12.926 region:rollup2
THE PANEL VERY SERIOUSLY.

01:52:11.325 --> 01:52:14.628 region:rollup2
ARE THE PANEL ARE NOT EMPLOYEE

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:16.196 region:rollup2
ARE NOT EMPLOYEES THERE UNDER

01:52:14.628 --> 01:52:17.965 region:rollup2
CONTRACT US BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:19.566 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE HOUSED.

01:52:17.965 --> 01:52:21.001 region:rollup2
HERE IN TERMS OF WORKING HERE SO

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:23.103 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THEM I

01:52:21.001 --> 01:52:24.571 region:rollup2
THINK TO KIND OF HAVE CARTE

01:52:23.103 --> 01:52:25.906 region:rollup2
BLANCHE IN TO BE.

01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:27.007 region:rollup2
CHECKED IT SHOULD NOT BE THE TO

01:52:25.906 --> 01:52:28.742 region:rollup2
BE BEYOND IT MAKING

01:52:27.007 --> 01:52:30.177 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:52:28.742 --> 01:52:31.244 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY OF SUPERVISORS AT THE

01:52:30.177 --> 01:52:32.379 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES THAT NEED TO ACT ON

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:33.680 region:rollup2
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:52:32.379 --> 01:52:35.415 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:37.384 region:rollup2
WORKING DAY TO DAY WITH THE

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:38.585 region:rollup2
STAFF AND LA COUNTY THAT'S HOW

01:52:37.384 --> 01:52:40.320 region:rollup2
THEIR SYSTEM WORKS IN THIS IS

01:52:38.585 --> 01:52:41.154 region:rollup2
MODEL VERY MUCH ON THAT WERE

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:43.657 region:rollup2
THEIR PANELS.

01:52:41.154 --> 01:52:44.257 region:rollup2
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND 98% OF

01:52:43.657 --> 01:52:45.459 region:rollup2
THE TIME THEY SAY THEY ARE

01:52:44.257 --> 01:52:49.229 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED BUT OCCASIONALLY A

01:52:45.459 --> 01:52:50.530 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR WILL COME IN AND SAY.

01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:52.299 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHY WE HAVE TO TWEAK THIS

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:53.333 region:rollup2
ARE HERE'S WHY WE DISAGREE AND

01:52:52.299 --> 01:52:54.701 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEIR THE PANEL

01:52:53.333 --> 01:52:56.136 region:rollup2
IS NOT THEIR DAY TO DAY TO TO BE

01:52:54.701 --> 01:52:57.404 region:rollup2
IN THOSE OFFICES.

01:52:56.136 --> 01:53:01.308 region:rollup2
BUT I IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE ALSO

01:52:57.404 --> 01:53:02.442 region:rollup2
HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF AGREEMENT

01:53:01.308 --> 01:53:03.677 region:rollup2
AND CONSENSUS AND WORK WITH OUR

01:53:02.442 --> 01:53:04.978 region:rollup2
PANEL OTHERWISE THERE'S NOT MUCH

01:53:03.677 --> 01:53:05.379 region:rollup2
POINT TO HAVING THEM THERE IF WE

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:08.548 region:rollup2
DON'T ACT ON THOSE

01:53:05.379 --> 01:53:09.850 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:53:08.548 --> 01:53:12.219 region:rollup2
SENATOR MITCHELL HAD IN.

01:53:09.850 --> 01:53:13.487 region:rollup2
I HEAR YOUR QUESTION MISTER DALI

01:53:12.219 --> 01:53:15.055 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ABOUT ONE AND ONE THAT

01:53:13.487 --> 01:53:16.490 region:rollup2
WE CAN GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:53:15.055 --> 01:53:19.426 region:rollup2
TO WORK THROUGH.

01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:21.395 region:rollup2
AND I I MIGHT DISAGREE WITH YOU

01:53:19.426 --> 01:53:23.363 region:rollup2
A LITTLE I THINK WHILE LA

01:53:21.395 --> 01:53:25.098 region:rollup2
COUNTY'S NUMBERS ARE LARGER THE

01:53:23.363 --> 01:53:26.700 region:rollup2
DYNAMIC WITH THAT MADE IT

01:53:25.098 --> 01:53:28.402 region:rollup2
APPEALING I THINK FOR US.

01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:30.303 region:rollup2
AND OF ALL THE MODELS WE LOOKED

01:53:28.402 --> 01:53:32.873 region:rollup2
AT THE MOST RELEVANT IT WAS IT

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:34.508 region:rollup2
WAS A WORK FOR AN ELECTED BODY.

01:53:32.873 --> 01:53:35.709 region:rollup2
SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ONE TWENTY

01:53:34.508 --> 01:53:37.577 region:rollup2
THEIR FIVE IT'S STILL THE

01:53:35.709 --> 01:53:38.512 region:rollup2
DYNAMIC OF THE WORK FORCE AN

01:53:37.577 --> 01:53:40.547 region:rollup2
ELECTED BODY.

01:53:38.512 --> 01:53:42.883 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY'VE.

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:44.518 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO APPLY IT. TO THEIR

01:53:42.883 --> 01:53:45.552 region:rollup2
HIT OF OR UNIVERSE WE ALSO

01:53:44.518 --> 01:53:47.521 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE IT'S SLIGHTLY

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:49.189 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BECAUSE MANY.

01:53:47.521 --> 01:53:50.957 region:rollup2
OF THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE CIVIL

01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:52.359 region:rollup2

MEMBERS OF THE BOARD HAVE

01:53:54.561 --> 01:53:57.597 region:rollup2
SEVERED THE PLEASURE PLEASE SO

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:58.398 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT WAS A MODEL THAT WE

01:53:57.597 --> 01:54:00.233 region:rollup2
THOUGHT.

01:53:58.398 --> 01:54:01.601 region:rollup2
APPLY BECAUSE IT WOULD IMPACT

01:54:00.233 --> 01:54:03.437 region:rollup2
BOTH THE ELECTED [inaudible]

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:05.305 region:rollup2
AND STAFF.

01:54:03.437 --> 01:54:08.375 region:rollup2

LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK SOME THAT'S

01:54:25.092 --> 01:54:27.494 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:28.562 region:rollup2
TWO HOUSES BUT SENATE RULES IN

01:54:27.494 --> 01:54:30.330 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY RULES.

01:54:28.562 --> 01:54:31.932 region:rollup2
SO WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK ON

01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:33.500 region:rollup2
HOW WE INCORPORATE THEIR

01:54:31.932 --> 01:54:35.302 region:rollup2

01:58:56.496 --> 01:58:59.466 region:rollup2
WE OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:59:01.034 --> 01:59:05.739 region:rollup2
KIND OF VIEWING THINGS ON YOU.

01:59:03.803 --> 01:59:08.541 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE THREE

01:59:05.739 --> 01:59:09.376 region:rollup2
UNANIMOUS DECISIONS I THINK THAT

01:59:08.541 --> 01:59:10.243 region:rollup2

01:59:09.376 --> 01:59:11.878 region:rollup2

I IT'S NOT COVERED HERE BUT I

01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:17.717 region:rollup2

COVERED HERE BUT AGAIN IN THE

01:59:17.717 --> 01:59:21.287 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

01:59:18.485 --> 01:59:23.823 region:rollup2
I DO NOT REMEMBER WHAT.

01:59:21.287 --> 01:59:25.425 region:rollup2
WHAT THE NEXT STEP WAS AFTER IT

01:59:23.823 --> 01:59:27.527 region:rollup2
MOVED FROM HARASSMENT

01:59:25.425 --> 01:59:29.195 region:rollup2

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:30.463 region:rollup2
THEN A FAULT BECAUSE?

01:59:29.195 --> 01:59:32.098 region:rollup2
I THINK PRESENTLY THAT

01:59:30.463 --> 01:59:33.833 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY GOES TO LAW

01:59:32.098 --> 01:59:35.702 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT RATHER THEN THROUGH

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:37.203 region:rollup2

THAT THAT'S A DIFFERENT LEVEL

01:59:41.908 --> 01:59:46.179 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE.

01:59:43.710 --> 01:59:47.447 region:rollup2
REFERRED BEYOND THE PALACE AND

01:59:46.179 --> 01:59:49.082 region:rollup2

EXPERIECE THAT PROBABLY ISN'T

01:59:50.083 --> 01:59:53.787 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE BUT JUST TO PUT IT ON

01:59:51.618 --> 01:59:56.122 region:rollup2

HAVE THEIR NINE PANELISTS AND

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:14.941 region:rollup2
THEN THOSE PANELS OF THREE THEY

02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:16.543 region:rollup2
ROTATE THEM AROUND ACTUALLY NOT

02:00:14.941 --> 02:00:17.911 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING THAT THEY TRY TO

02:00:16.543 --> 02:00:19.479 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE THEM.

02:00:17.911 --> 02:00:20.680 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BE THE SAME PEOPLE.

02:00:19.479 --> 02:00:21.748 region:rollup2
I GUESS WITH ONLY NINE BECAUSE

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:23.283 region:rollup2
THEY MEET TWICE A WEEK THEY END

02:00:21.748 --> 02:00:24.584 region:rollup2

THEY WORK WITH EACH OTHER SO

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:28.421 region:rollup2
OFTEN BUT THEY ARE WORKING WITH.

02:00:27.087 --> 02:00:30.423 region:rollup2

THREE THREE THREE ONE YOU GOT.

02:00:34.327 --> 02:00:38.064 region:rollup2

IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL ACTION I

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:48.808 region:rollup2
BELIEVE LA COUNTY REFERRERS TO

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:50.643 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IF

02:00:48.808 --> 02:00:52.712 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL ACTS --

02:00:50.643 --> 02:00:54.514 region:rollup2
IF IT IS BEEN DEEMED THAT A

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:55.515 region:rollup2
CRIME WAS COMMITTED.

02:00:54.514 --> 02:00:57.951 region:rollup2
THAT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

02:00:55.515 --> 02:00:59.052 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT EXPLICITLY STATED TO

02:00:57.951 --> 02:01:00.120 region:rollup2

OF THE IT AND YOU'RE RIGHT MR.

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:28.381 region:rollup2
WHERE I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN

02:01:25.945 --> 02:01:29.983 region:rollup2
ANY ABSENCES AND I APPRECIATE

02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:31.584 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK WE'LL TOOK THIS?

02:01:29.983 --> 02:01:34.921 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUSLY WE KNEW IT WAS

02:01:31.584 --> 02:01:38.057 region:rollup2
SOMETHING IMPORTANT AND WE WANT

02:01:34.921 --> 02:01:39.192 region:rollup2
TO BE ENGAGED --

02:01:38.057 --> 02:01:41.427 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN

02:01:39.192 --> 02:01:42.729 region:rollup2
OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:45.798 region:rollup2
HEARINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING

02:01:42.729 --> 02:01:46.866 region:rollup2
AND TODAY'S VERY SPECIFIC.

02:01:45.798 --> 02:01:49.836 region:rollup2
ONE IF IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:51.304 region:rollup2
CHANGE. TO THE INSTITUTION TO

02:01:49.836 --> 02:01:52.806 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO THE HARASSMENT I

02:01:51.304 --> 02:01:53.806 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHAT

02:01:52.806 --> 02:01:55.708 region:rollup2
IS HAPPENING INSIDE.

02:01:53.806 --> 02:01:58.077 region:rollup2
AND OUTSIDE.

02:01:55.708 --> 02:01:59.646 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE QUESTIONS ALLOW STE

02:01:58.077 --> 02:02:01.080 region:rollup2
AND I ASKED THE QUESTION

02:01:59.646 --> 02:02:02.515 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE LOBBYISTS AND THE

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:04.617 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE --

02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:06.252 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT BECAUSE THAT WAS

02:02:04.617 --> 02:02:08.054 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

02:02:06.252 --> 02:02:09.722 region:rollup2
SURPRISED ME QUITE FRANKLY.

02:02:08.054 --> 02:02:12.058 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS A FINDING THAT

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:13.159 region:rollup2
SURPRISED ME AND SO I WANT TO BE

02:02:12.058 --> 02:02:15.261 region:rollup2
SURE THAT.

02:02:13.159 --> 02:02:16.829 region:rollup2
IN OUR IT THE WAY WE ADDRESS

02:02:15.261 --> 02:02:18.264 region:rollup2
THIS I DO WANT TO BE SURE THAT

02:02:16.829 --> 02:02:19.632 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:21.868 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSES IT THE

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:23.770 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT THAT OUR STAFF FEELS

02:02:21.868 --> 02:02:26.039 region:rollup2
FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES WITH OUR BE

02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:28.241 region:rollup2
LOBBYISTS OR THE PUBLIC --

02:02:26.039 --> 02:02:30.543 region:rollup2
I AM VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT

02:02:28.241 --> 02:02:32.846 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE.

02:02:30.543 --> 02:02:33.847 region:rollup2
BUT OUR OUR OUR EMPLOYEES WITH

02:02:32.846 --> 02:02:36.249 region:rollup2
ONE ANOTHER HAVE WONDERFUL

02:02:33.847 --> 02:02:36.683 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY DO FEEL

02:02:36.249 --> 02:02:38.384 region:rollup2
THEY CAN TRUST THEIR

02:02:36.683 --> 02:02:40.753 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS.

02:02:38.384 --> 02:02:41.621 region:rollup2
IT'S THE PROCESS.

02:02:40.753 --> 02:02:43.056 region:rollup2
THAT I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE WE

02:02:41.621 --> 02:02:44.190 region:rollup2
BREAK IT WERE WERE ALL

02:02:43.056 --> 02:02:45.024 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION BREAKS DOWN

02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:47.260 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST THE

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:48.795 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:50.129 region:rollup2
AND IS GOING BACK TO THE CULTURE

02:02:48.795 --> 02:02:52.532 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT SO I

02:02:50.129 --> 02:02:54.167 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT.

02:02:52.532 --> 02:02:55.134 region:rollup2
THE TRAINING.

02:02:54.167 --> 02:02:56.836 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S AS

02:02:55.134 --> 02:02:59.272 region:rollup2
MUCH OF A COMPLAINT REGARDING

02:02:56.836 --> 02:03:01.474 region:rollup2
THE TRAINING IT'S WHAT HAPPENS

02:02:59.272 --> 02:03:03.309 region:rollup2
AFTER THE REPORT IS MADE.

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:05.011 region:rollup2
AND KNOWING THAT SOMETHING IS

02:03:03.309 --> 02:03:06.980 region:rollup2
GOING TO COME FROM THAT SO I

02:03:05.011 --> 02:03:10.149 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS

02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:11.517 region:rollup2
OF OF THE PANEL AND SUBJECT

02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:13.553 region:rollup2
MATTER MEMBERS.

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:15.154 region:rollup2
IS SO IMPORTANT AND I AND I AM

02:03:13.553 --> 02:03:16.990 region:rollup2
VERY GRATEFUL TO LOS ANGELES

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:18.424 region:rollup2
COUNTY FOR SHARING THAT

02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:20.860 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH US.

02:03:18.424 --> 02:03:22.395 region:rollup2
AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT THIS

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:25.064 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL SAW.

02:03:22.395 --> 02:03:26.633 region:rollup2
AS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EMULATE

02:03:25.064 --> 02:03:29.502 region:rollup2
IN THE BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT

02:03:26.633 --> 02:03:30.703 region:rollup2
HOW WE BEGIN TO GAIN THAT TRUST.

02:03:29.502 --> 02:03:32.772 region:rollup2
THAT THE INSTITUTION DOES NOT

ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:06.973 region:rollup2
ISSUE -- AS

DEEP IN ISSUE IS AN IMPORTANT

02:04:06.973 --> 02:04:11.511 region:rollup2
ISSUE AS IT IS --

02:04:08.875 --> 02:04:13.913 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING IS THE FACT THAT

02:04:11.511 --> 02:04:15.915 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A A PROCESS THAT'S BEEN

02:04:13.913 --> 02:04:17.250 region:rollup2

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:20.086 region:rollup2
VETTED THROUGH IN.

02:04:17.250 --> 02:04:21.654 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES IS HELPING US TAKE A

02:04:20.086 --> 02:04:22.789 region:rollup2

02:05:37.130 --> 02:05:40.666 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE END.

02:05:38.664 --> 02:05:41.134 region:rollup2
I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW HOW THAT'S

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:43.636 region:rollup2
HANDLED.

02:05:41.134 --> 02:05:45.438 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT THAT YOU KNOW

02:05:43.636 --> 02:05:47.540 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF CREATING THIS NEW

02:05:45.438 --> 02:05:49.308 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE UNIT WILL ALSO BE

02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:50.777 region:rollup2
TO EMPOWER THEM TO INFORM US ON

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:51.711 region:rollup2
THE DRILL DOWN IN TERMS OF HOW

02:05:50.777 --> 02:05:52.845 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT WHAT

02:05:51.711 --> 02:05:53.446 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING IS SETTING POLICY

02:05:52.845 --> 02:05:56.849 region:rollup2
SAYING.

02:05:53.446 --> 02:05:58.751 region:rollup2
WE WANT EMPLOYEES TO BE IN

02:05:56.849 --> 02:06:00.086 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS.

02:05:58.751 --> 02:06:01.521 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT FRANKLY

02:06:00.086 --> 02:06:02.622 region:rollup2
IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO GET

02:06:01.521 --> 02:06:04.290 region:rollup2
TO A LEVEL OF DETAIL WILL WE'RE

02:06:02.622 --> 02:06:06.459 region:rollup2
GONNA SAY AND THIS IS HOW YOU'LL

02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:08.127 region:rollup2
DO IT MISTER MISS INVESTIGATOR

02:06:06.459 --> 02:06:10.063 region:rollup2
ASSIGNING CASE NUMBER BLAHBLAH

02:06:08.127 --> 02:06:11.130 region:rollup2
BLAH I THINK THOSE ARE.

02:06:10.063 --> 02:06:13.099 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE CAN SAY TO THEM

02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:14.400 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN I THINK.

02:06:13.099 --> 02:06:17.570 region:rollup2
OUR ROLE HOPEFULLY WILL BE TO

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:19.539 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THIS UNIT WHERE --

02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:22.308 region:rollup2
OUR GOALS ARE EXPECTATIONS OF

02:06:19.539 --> 02:06:23.843 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME I THINK THE HOW WILL

02:06:22.308 --> 02:06:25.478 region:rollup2
BE LEFT UP TO THAT UNIT TO

02:06:23.843 --> 02:06:26.279 region:rollup2
INFORM US IN TERMS OF BEST

02:06:25.478 --> 02:06:26.879 region:rollup2
PRACTICES OUT ENOUGH CASE

02:06:26.279 --> 02:06:28.214 region:rollup2
NUMBERS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO

02:06:26.879 --> 02:06:29.849 region:rollup2
IT.

02:06:28.214 --> 02:06:31.417 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE WANTED A HIRE

02:06:29.849 --> 02:06:34.320 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS WHO HAVE

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:36.122 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE TO PROVIDE US WITH.

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.956 region:rollup2
CLEAR FOR CATION SUGGESTIONS ON

02:06:36.122 --> 02:06:39.025 region:rollup2
THE BEST WAY TO IMPLEMENT I

02:06:36.956 --> 02:06:40.059 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE WAY

02:06:39.025 --> 02:06:41.527 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD ADVISE THAT WE

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:43.062 region:rollup2
DO IT YEAH YOU KNOW WE'RE CLEAR

02:06:41.527 --> 02:06:44.864 region:rollup2
AS WE HEARD THROUGH THE HEARING

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:46.799 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT.

02:06:44.864 --> 02:06:48.801 region:rollup2
THAT ON ANONYMITY IS SOMETHING

02:06:46.799 --> 02:06:50.670 region:rollup2
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A

02:06:48.801 --> 02:06:51.237 region:rollup2
REALITY IN TERMS OF PEOPLE

02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:52.371 region:rollup2
WANTING TO COME FOR BUT NOT

02:06:51.237 --> 02:06:54.407 region:rollup2
WILLING.

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:55.374 region:rollup2
TO NAME SO IT WILL BE UP TO

02:06:54.407 --> 02:06:56.976 region:rollup2
THOSE INVESTIGATORS TO FIGURE

02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:58.711 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO CREATE THAT BALANCE

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:59.879 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

02:06:58.711 --> 02:07:01.481 region:rollup2
WE WILL SEND THEM THE MESSAGE

02:06:59.879 --> 02:07:03.382 region:rollup2
LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WE NEED

02:07:01.481 --> 02:07:06.385 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES INFORMED ABOUT THE

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:08.955 region:rollup2
PROCESS AS APPROPRIATE.

02:07:06.385 --> 02:07:10.256 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT NINE YEAH ABSOLUTELY

02:07:08.955 --> 02:07:11.324 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL BE INFORMED.

02:07:10.256 --> 02:07:12.558 region:rollup2
AS SENATOR MITCHELL SAID WE

02:07:11.324 --> 02:07:13.693 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS OF HOW

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:15.595 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING YOU KNOW EXACTLY

02:07:13.693 --> 02:07:16.963 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT PROCESS WILL BE BUT IT

02:07:15.595 --> 02:07:18.598 region:rollup2
WON'T BE THE CASE THAT PEOPLE

02:07:16.963 --> 02:07:19.932 region:rollup2
SUBMIT A REPORT YOU KNOW UNDER

02:07:18.598 --> 02:07:21.067 region:rollup2
THEIR NAME AND DON'T HEAR BACK

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:21.567 region:rollup2
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS I MEAN WE

02:07:21.067 --> 02:07:25.171 region:rollup2
WILL LET THEM.

02:07:21.567 --> 02:07:26.038 region:rollup2

CERTAINLY WHEN THERE'S BEEN A

02:07:28.875 --> 02:07:32.211 region:rollup2
RESPONSE THEY'LL BE NOTIFIED

02:07:30.710 --> 02:07:33.446 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S BEEN A RESPONSE.

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:35.081 region:rollup2
I AND WE ALSO JUST BECAUSE WE

02:07:33.446 --> 02:07:35.581 region:rollup2
HAVE I DIDN'T SAY IT IN MY

02:07:35.081 --> 02:07:36.616 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION WE WILL BE

02:07:35.581 --> 02:07:38.284 region:rollup2

ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS AND WE WILL

02:07:38.284 --> 02:07:40.753 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE THOSE TO THE BEST OF

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:43.256 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY WE HAVE A

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:44.657 region:rollup2

HARASSMENT OTHER TYPES OF

02:07:47.126 --> 02:07:49.428 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION SO THOSE WILL BE

02:07:48.561 --> 02:07:50.863 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED BUT CLEARLY IN THAT

02:07:49.428 --> 02:07:52.632 region:rollup2
CASE THERE'S NO ONE TO REPORT

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:52.899 region:rollup2
BACK.

02:07:52.632 --> 02:07:54.834 region:rollup2
TO OKAY --

02:07:52.899 --> 02:07:56.002 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

02:07:54.834 --> 02:07:59.605 region:rollup2
JUST THIS MAY BE JUST A

02:07:56.002 --> 02:08:00.973 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL.

02:07:59.605 --> 02:08:02.308 region:rollup2
YOU JUST CERTAIN NOT EVEN A TYPO

02:08:00.973 --> 02:08:03.776 region:rollup2
BUT MORE OF THE WAY IT WAS

02:08:02.308 --> 02:08:05.111 region:rollup2
WORDED.

02:08:03.776 --> 02:08:08.314 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL --

02:08:05.111 --> 02:08:11.017 region:rollup2
DRAFT OF POLICY.

02:08:08.314 --> 02:08:12.785 region:rollup2
ON THE C. FUND PAID SEVEN AND

02:08:11.017 --> 02:08:15.721 region:rollup2
OUR HAND THOUGH [inaudible]

02:08:12.785 --> 02:08:17.623 region:rollup2
SAYS [inaudible]

02:08:15.721 --> 02:08:19.025 region:rollup2
THAT WHERE'S WE HAVE SO MANY

02:08:17.623 --> 02:08:21.093 region:rollup2
PAPERS HERE.

02:08:19.025 --> 02:08:22.228 region:rollup2
THAT THE SUPERVISOR.

BUT YET IN OUR THE HANDLE THE

02:08:33.839 --> 02:08:38.878 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ON PAGE TWO IT'S

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:40.279 region:rollup2
A SUIT SUPERVISORS SHOULD REPORT

02:08:38.878 --> 02:08:42.281 region:rollup2

MEAN I WOULD GO WITH THE POLICY

02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:45.117 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT SAYS.

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:47.787 region:rollup2
THAT THE REPORT NOT THAT THEY

02:08:45.117 --> 02:08:50.957 region:rollup2

QUICKLY MOVE NUMBER THAT JUST

02:08:52.225 --> 02:08:56.862 region:rollup2
HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF

02:08:53.192 --> 02:08:59.265 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WILL BE BRIEF --

02:08:56.862 --> 02:09:00.766 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT HOW IN

02:08:59.265 --> 02:09:02.068 region:rollup2
THAT GOES BACK TO WHAT WAS SAID

02:09:00.766 --> 02:09:04.537 region:rollup2
ABOUT --

02:09:02.068 --> 02:09:07.573 region:rollup2
WHEN THINGS ARE DISCLOSED THAT

02:09:04.537 --> 02:09:08.908 region:rollup2
THE HOUSE OF BASICALLY RULES?

02:09:07.573 --> 02:09:10.109 region:rollup2
WILL RELEASE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS

02:09:08.908 --> 02:09:12.144 region:rollup2
IN CASES WHERE THE PANEL

02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:13.713 region:rollup2
DETERMINES THAT FACTS RELATED TO

02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:15.314 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS HAVE

02:09:13.713 --> 02:09:17.083 region:rollup2
BEEN SUBSTANTIATED.

02:09:15.314 --> 02:09:18.684 region:rollup2
AGAINST A MEMBER OR A HIGH LEVEL

02:09:17.083 --> 02:09:20.253 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE.

02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:21.887 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES SO ONCE IT'S GONE

02:09:20.253 --> 02:09:23.422 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT INDEPENDENT.

02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:24.590 region:rollup2
PANEL THEY'VE MADE A

02:09:23.422 --> 02:09:26.492 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FOUND IT TO BE

02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:28.594 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIVE.

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:30.363 region:rollup2
THEN RIGHT NOW OUR POLICY DRAFT

02:09:28.594 --> 02:09:32.565 region:rollup2
IS STATING THAT IT COMES BACK TO

02:09:30.363 --> 02:09:34.266 region:rollup2
RULES WILL DETERMINE IF THEY

02:09:32.565 --> 02:09:35.735 region:rollup2
ACCEPT OR NOT ACCEPT.

02:09:34.266 --> 02:09:37.670 region:rollup2
AND THAT ONE POINT THAT WOULD

02:09:35.735 --> 02:09:39.538 region:rollup2
BECOME PUBLIC IF IT'S

02:09:37.670 --> 02:09:42.775 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED [inaudible]

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:45.544 region:rollup2
I'M.

02:09:42.775 --> 02:09:48.114 region:rollup2
IF THEY IF SAY RULES DECIDES NOT

02:09:45.544 --> 02:09:49.682 region:rollup2
TO ACCEPT.

02:09:48.114 --> 02:09:52.618 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THE CAN THE PANEL

02:09:49.682 --> 02:09:54.320 region:rollup2
SAYS IT'S SUBSTANTIATED.

02:09:52.618 --> 02:09:56.255 region:rollup2
SHOULD I WOULD ASSUME BE STILL

02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.891 region:rollup2
MADE PUBLIC BECAUSE THEN.

02:09:56.255 --> 02:10:00.993 region:rollup2
RULES WOULD HAVE TO STTE WHY.

02:09:58.891 --> 02:10:03.863 region:rollup2
DECLINED AT SOME POINT IT WOULD

02:10:00.993 --> 02:10:05.464 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE.

02:10:03.863 --> 02:10:07.366 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AND IT GOES BACK TO THE

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:09.468 region:rollup2
CONCERN.

02:10:07.366 --> 02:10:10.536 region:rollup2
OF BEING POLITICAL YOU KNOW IF

02:10:09.468 --> 02:10:13.639 region:rollup2
WE COULD KEEP IT AS MUCH AS

02:10:10.536 --> 02:10:15.041 region:rollup2
ARM'S LENGTH.

02:10:13.639 --> 02:10:16.776 region:rollup2
IT'S SHOULD ALMOST BE IF IT

02:10:15.041 --> 02:10:19.078 region:rollup2
COMES BACK FROM THE COMMITTEE.

02:10:16.776 --> 02:10:21.147 region:rollup2
THAT THE UNIT AS BEING

02:10:19.078 --> 02:10:22.882 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATE IT MUST BE MET OR

02:10:21.147 --> 02:10:24.750 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC JUST TO BE

02:10:22.882 --> 02:10:25.318 region:rollup2
CLEAR THERE'S TWO SEPARATE PARTS

02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:27.320 region:rollup2
TO WHAT THE PANEL WILL BE

02:10:25.318 --> 02:10:28.754 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT ONE IS WHETHER IT'S A

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.922 region:rollup2
VIOLATION OF OUR POLICY.

02:10:28.754 --> 02:10:32.191 region:rollup2
AND AT WHAT LEVEL.

02:10:29.922 --> 02:10:33.659 region:rollup2
THAT IF IT'S DETERMINED THAT IT

02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:35.728 region:rollup2
WAS A VIOLATION OF OUR SEXUAL

02:10:33.659 --> 02:10:36.329 region:rollup2
HARASSMENTPOLICY. FOR SENIOR

02:10:35.728 --> 02:10:38.864 region:rollup2
STAFF AND MEMBERS THAT WILL BE

02:10:36.329 --> 02:10:40.533 region:rollup2
THIS SECOND PART IS THE

02:10:38.864 --> 02:10:41.467 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS THE

02:10:40.533 --> 02:10:43.235 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED ACCOUNTABILITY

02:10:41.467 --> 02:10:45.504 region:rollup2
MEASURES AND THAT BY OUR POLICY

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:46.572 region:rollup2
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED.

02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:48.240 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT WILL GO

02:10:46.572 --> 02:10:50.276 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE EACH REPRESENTATIVE

02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:51.577 region:rollup2
EACH OF SEPARATE HOUSE FOR

02:10:50.276 --> 02:10:52.478 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION OF WHETHER.

02:10:51.577 --> 02:10:55.948 region:rollup2
TO BASICALLY FOLLOW THE

02:10:52.478 --> 02:10:59.185 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO THE

02:10:55.948 --> 02:11:01.253 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE OR THE RESPONSE.

02:10:59.185 --> 02:11:03.356 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY CAN THEY PANEL

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:05.091 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THESE OF SUBSTANTIATED

02:11:03.356 --> 02:11:08.060 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC OF

02:11:05.091 --> 02:11:08.360 region:rollup2
THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SUIT

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:10.363 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:12.865 region:rollup2
INSTANTIATED THEN.

02:11:10.363 --> 02:11:15.601 region:rollup2
THE HOUSE RULES WOULD SAY THEY

02:11:12.865 --> 02:11:16.769 region:rollup2
ACCEPT OR REJECT. FOR SENIORS

02:11:15.601 --> 02:11:18.671 region:rollup2
OFTEN FOR MEMBERS THAT'S THAT'S

02:11:16.769 --> 02:11:19.805 region:rollup2
MY RECOMMENDATION --

02:11:18.671 --> 02:11:21.273 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE RECOMMENDATION AND

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:23.409 region:rollup2
I'M PUTTING FORWARD TO ALL OF

02:11:21.273 --> 02:11:24.944 region:rollup2
YOU THAT THAT THAT THERE'S THIS

02:11:23.409 --> 02:11:26.445 region:rollup2
TWO SEPARATE ELEMENTS ONE IS THE

02:11:24.944 --> 02:11:28.080 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT WAS

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:29.915 region:rollup2
A VIOLATION OF POLICY AND IF SO

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:31.183 region:rollup2
WHAT LEVEL IS A JUST A VIOLATION

02:11:29.915 --> 02:11:33.185 region:rollup2
OF ARE.

02:11:31.183 --> 02:11:35.654 region:rollup2
INTERNAL COULD CONDUCT OR DOES

02:11:33.185 --> 02:11:36.856 region:rollup2
IT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL

02:11:35.654 --> 02:11:37.957 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND IT'S THOSE

02:11:36.856 --> 02:11:39.558 region:rollup2
THAT RISE TO THAT LEVEL OF

02:11:37.957 --> 02:11:40.359 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:42.395 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE DISCLOSED TO THE

02:11:40.359 --> 02:11:44.463 region:rollup2
PRESS THE SECOND PART IS THE

02:11:42.395 --> 02:11:45.664 region:rollup2
PANEL WITH THAT ALSO SAY.

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:47.500 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A VIOLATION OF POLICY

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:49.268 region:rollup2
AT SUCH AND SUCH A LEVEL AN HOUR

02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:50.302 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED RESPONSES AND I

02:11:49.268 --> 02:11:51.203 region:rollup2
WOULD THINK WITH MEMBERS YOU

02:11:50.302 --> 02:11:52.204 region:rollup2
KNOW IT IT MAY NOT BE SO

02:11:51.203 --> 02:11:53.239 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC IT MIGHT JUST BE

02:11:52.204 --> 02:11:54.774 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

02:11:53.239 --> 02:11:56.475 region:rollup2
OR MIGHT BE SOME LEVEL OF

02:11:54.774 --> 02:11:58.611 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE TO BE DETERMINED.

02:11:56.475 --> 02:12:00.212 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THAT THEN GOES TO THE

02:11:58.611 --> 02:12:02.481 region:rollup2
RESPECTIVE HOUSES TEND TO TO

02:12:00.212 --> 02:12:03.716 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT OKAY.

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:05.618 region:rollup2
GOOD BECAUSE YET AND I WASN'T

02:12:03.716 --> 02:12:07.386 region:rollup2
SURE ABOUT THAT SO FOR

02:12:05.618 --> 02:12:10.055 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION IT HELPS BECAUSE I

02:12:07.386 --> 02:12:11.223 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT THE POLITICS TO PLAY

02:12:10.055 --> 02:12:12.591 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDDLE WHAT GETS THE

02:12:11.223 --> 02:12:14.393 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND WHAT THOSE.

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:18.264 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS THE BIGGEST

02:12:14.393 --> 02:12:21.634 region:rollup2
QUESTION I HAVE HOME QUICKLY --

02:12:18.264 --> 02:12:22.968 region:rollup2
IF THE RULES COMMITTEE --

02:12:21.634 --> 02:12:26.839 region:rollup2
DEVIATES FROM WHAT THE PANEL

02:12:22.968 --> 02:12:28.007 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDS --

02:12:26.839 --> 02:12:30.876 region:rollup2
DOES.

02:12:28.007 --> 02:12:33.412 region:rollup2
DOES THE ACCUSER OR DOES THE THE

02:12:30.876 --> 02:12:33.712 region:rollup2
VICTIM BASICALLY GET TO KNOW

02:12:33.412 --> 02:12:35.214 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:12:33.712 --> 02:12:38.150 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:12:35.214 --> 02:12:39.819 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT POINT.

02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:41.353 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW AND RESOLUTION OF

02:12:39.819 --> 02:12:44.723 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD THE ACTUAL COMPLAINT

02:12:41.353 --> 02:12:47.660 region:rollup2
AND GET TO KNOW WHAT THE RESULT

02:12:44.723 --> 02:12:49.028 region:rollup2
WAS AS FAR AS THE PUNISHMENT.

02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:50.796 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT --

02:12:49.028 --> 02:12:52.598 region:rollup2
WHAT'S DISCLOSED TO THE

02:12:50.796 --> 02:12:54.099 region:rollup2
REPORTING PARTY IS PROBABLY

02:12:52.598 --> 02:12:57.136 region:rollup2
GOING TO VARY DEPENDING ON THE

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:58.204 region:rollup2
TYPE OF INCIDENT THAT IT IS.

02:12:57.136 --> 02:13:00.072 region:rollup2
WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHAT'S

02:12:58.204 --> 02:13:01.040 region:rollup2
NOT I THINK IT'S I I PERSONALLY

02:13:00.072 --> 02:13:03.576 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:06.278 region:rollup2
MAKE A POLICY THAT SAYS.

02:13:03.576 --> 02:13:07.780 region:rollup2

CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUES THERE'S

THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES

02:13:11.684 --> 02:13:13.853 region:rollup2
BUT THEY WILL KNOW THAT THERE

KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:18.824 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION --

02:13:16.789 --> 02:13:20.326 region:rollup2
THEY WILL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:21.827 region:rollup2
THE COMPLAINTS SUBSTANTIATED

02:13:20.326 --> 02:13:23.295 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WILL ABSOLUTELY NO IN

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:24.730 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE RESPONSE YOU KNOW

02:13:23.295 --> 02:13:26.098 region:rollup2
MOST OF MOST OF THE COMPLAINTS

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:33.305 region:rollup2
IS SOME CONFIDENTIALITY THAT HAS

02:13:32.438 --> 02:13:34.673 region:rollup2
TO BE WEIGHED IN TERMS OF WHAT

02:13:33.305 --> 02:13:36.208 region:rollup2
THE YOU MAY IT MAY NOT BE

02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:37.610 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TO GO TO SOMEONE WHO

BE DISCLOSED.

02:13:51.457 --> 02:13:56.495 region:rollup2
