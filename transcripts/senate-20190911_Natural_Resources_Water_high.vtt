00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.760
WE TAKE CARE OF IT LATER R. O.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:11.097
H. B. PARKS ARE THE CLEANEST

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:11.731
EXAMPLE OF HOW H. B. RECREATION

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:14.100
SHOULD BE DONE. THE SECOND

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:15.234
REASON WERE OPPOSED TO THE

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.670
BILL. IS THAT IT SETS A VERY

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:21.340
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. PARKS DID

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:22.408
EVERYTHING THEY WERE SUPPOSED

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:24.143
TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.745
PARK COULD BE USED FOR OFF

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.147
HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:30.283
MANY OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.084
BILL WHO ARE SUPPORT THIS BILL

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.854
IN A PROPOSAL A TV AT THE TIME.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.222
THAT IT WAS SET ASIDE FOR A WAY

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.791
TO BE RECREATION TOOK ADVANTAGE

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.793
OF THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.994
THAT THEY GOT RIGHT OF WAYS FOR

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:43.629
THEIR OWN PROPERTY. THEY MADE

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:46.566
SURE THAT THE VERY WOULD TAKEN

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.200
CARE OF AND NOW THEY OPPOSE THE

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:48.301
IDEA OF HAVING IT IN THEIR

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:50.503
NEIGHBORHOOD. IF YOU ALLOW THIS

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.738
BILL TO GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.575
TIME STATE PARKS SETS ASIDE A

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.944

SUPPORT HD BUT NOT HERE IT'S A

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.770
LITTLE BIT SIMILAR TO THE

HERE AND THEN IT BECOMES NOT

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:15.614
REALLY ANYWHERE. A SO MY

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:18.184
CONCERN IS THAT IT MAY MAKE IT

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.685
IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:21.320

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.698
SO THAT IF WE'RE REALLY

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.066
CONCERNED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.568

BE ABLE TO RECREATION FOR A

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:40.506
COUPLE OF HOURS AND THEN THEY

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:41.841
HAVE TO DRIVE SIX HOURS BACK

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:44.243
AND I SAID I'M I'M I I'M NOT

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.412
AND I KNOW EACH BE ENTHUSIAST.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.515

PEOPLE THAT THAT THAT ARE AND

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.228
WHAT THEY TELL ME IS THAT THEY

DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT WE ARE

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.389

WHEN WE'RE GOING TO OVER RULE

THAT WISE WE GIVE THAT THE

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:38.164
AUTHORITY DID THAT TO OUR

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.567
DEPARTMENTS AND AT SOME POINT

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:42.201
WE NEED TO. THEN LISTEN TO THEM

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:47.173

THOUGHT I WAS IN H. B.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.013
ENTHUSIAST AND THEN I JUST

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.147
REALIZED I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:58.050
DO IT. SO MAYBE I'M NOT ANYMORE

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.919
AND MAYBE NEED TO RECONSIDER

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.520

OF THE LEGISLATURE AT LEAST THE

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:21.574
SENATE USED TO BE THE BILL'S

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.075
TELLING COMMITTEE OF THE OTHER

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:24.710

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:26.112

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.957
TRADITION SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:39.258
WHICH IT WAS AND I DIFFICULT IS

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.459
MAJOR WAS HELD IN THE ASSEMBLY

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.161
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND I

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:44.563
WOULD ARGUE APPROPRIATELY. THAT

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.265
SHOULD BE THE END OF IT WE

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:49.535
SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:50.169
LISTENING TO THIS A LAST MINUTE

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:52.571
GOTTEN AMEND. WE EITHER HAVE

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:54.840
TRADITIONS AND IN THE SENATE

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.008
THAT WE'RE GONNA LIVE BY RULES

00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:59.111
AND PRACTICES. OR I'VE AFRAID

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:00.146
TO THAT THE SENATE IS GIVING UP

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:03.582
A PORTION OF ITS INTEGRITY. BY

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:04.183
HAVING THIS COME UP AT SUCH A

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.287
LATE TIME. SECONDLY AND MORE TO

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.089
THE POINT OF THE BILL OF THE

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:12.458
POLICY IMPLICATIONS HAS HAS

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:12.958
BEEN SHARED ALREADY THIS

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:13.425
MORNING ARE EXTREMELY

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:16.228
PROBLEMATIC. THE AREA

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:16.829
ENCOMPASSED BY THIS BILL WAS

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:19.965
PURCHASED WITH OAG FUNDS AND IT

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:21.400
IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR HV

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.736
PURPOSES. THE STATE WILL BE

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:24.436
GOING OUT BACK ON ITS

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:26.305
COMMITMENT ONCE AGAIN AND I'M

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:27.973
AFRAID THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.609
BE SET AND I JUST DID NOT SET

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:32.178
THAT PRESIDENT THAT THIS LAND

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.345
WAS APPROPRIATELY PURCHASED

00:13:33.412 --> 00:13:36.248
PROPERLY PLANNED. AND I THINK

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.316
ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS I'D

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:39.151
LIKE TO DRIVE. A LITTLE BIT

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:41.420
EVEN MOREAS THE MITIGATION ON

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:44.523
THESE TYPES OF PARKS. WELL I'VE

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.527
BEEN IN A LOT OF THEM AND I

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:51.830
AGREE WITH THAT MR MCHALE THAT.

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:52.865
THE R. O. H. V. PARKS IN

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:55.668
CALIFORNIA ARE PRISTINE AND-

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:56.869
WHAT THAT WOULD WITH THESE

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:57.937
ALWAYS FREE PARKS I THINK

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.573
SOMETIMES YOU LOSE THE FOCUS ON

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:01.173
THAT ON. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.342
WITH THE WHICH HE PARKS. IS IT

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:05.811
WE PLAN THEM WE PUT THEM IN A

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:08.347
PARTICULAR PART OF THE STATE.

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:09.949
THEY PROVIDE A RECREATION

GOING USE IT. AND THEN IT TAKES

00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:35.474
THE PRESSURE OFF. OTHER

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.877
PROPERTY OTHER LAND THAT IS NOW

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:39.411
ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS MOST

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:43.882
PRISTINE. AB SITUATION BECAUSE

EXCUSE FOR PEOPLE TO GO

BUT WHEN WE WHEN WE GIVE THEM.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.862
PROPERLY MANAGED IN PLAN AREAS

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:59.898
TO GO TO IT DECREASES THE

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:02.201
AMOUNT OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY IN

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:06.939
THOSE AREAS AND. AND WHAT

ROADERS WANT TO DO THE RIGHT

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:11.010
THING AND GO TO THE RIGHT

PLACES AND IN JOY THEIR STATE

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:15.881
AND SO I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:17.283
THIS COMMITTEE WILL TURN THIS

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:19.618
BILL DOWN AND THAT WILL GET

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:21.153
THIS ALWAYS THREE PARK PROPERLY

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.023
BUILT. AND USED FOR PEOPLE

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:25.624

THANK YOU MISS RICE FOR OTHERS

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:30.496
YES THERE WAS A JUST GENERALLY

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:33.799
AND THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE A

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:35.701
PROVISION THAT REQUIRES. IF

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.436
THIS LAND IS SOLD THAT'D BE

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.937
REPLACED WITH ANOTHER

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:42.141
RECREATION AREA. I IMAGINE IF

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:42.875
THIS IS SOLD FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:45.678
PURPOSES IF THEY- HAVE FOUND

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:48.080
THAT THERE IS ENORMOUS BAR

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:48.681
BERMAN VALLEY IN THIS LAND AND

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:51.717
IT IS SOLD. IS THERE A

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.586
REQUIREMENT THAT THIS ASSET BE

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:55.788
REPLACED IN TERMS OF ANOTHER

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:57.790
RECREATIONAL AREA. BECAUSE I

00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:59.558
DON'T SEE THAT IN IN IN THE

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.061
ANALYSIS SAID THE BILL DOESN'T

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.730
REQUIRE. ANYTHING OF THE STATE

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.332
PARKS IS PURELY GIVES STATE

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:09.001
PARKS THE RIGHT TO SELL THE

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.736
LAND FOR AT LEAST AS MUCH AS IT

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.671
WAS PURCHASED FOR. SO TO GET

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:13.772
THEIR MONEY BACK I UNDERSTAND

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:14.740
THAT MONEY GOES BACK TO BE

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.810
OFFERED VEHICLE PORTION TO USE

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:19.044
AS THEY WELL WE'RE NOT

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:20.579
MANDATING HOW STATE PARKS WILL

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:22.681
DO THAT BUT- I IMAGINE THEY

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:23.716
WOULD USE IT TO CREATE OFFERED

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:24.583
VEHICLE OPPORTUNITIES BUT I

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.252
WANT TO. ALSO SAY THAT YOU KNOW

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:28.253
SENATOR GLAZER AND HIS DRAFTING

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.755
OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.390
BILL WAS THOUGHTFUL IN MAKING

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:32.591
SURE THAT WE DO HAVE THE

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.193
OPPORTUNITY FOR OFFERED FOR

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:36.095
LEGAL OFFERED VEHICLE NEXT

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.197
DOOR. I MEAN CONTINUOUS WITH

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:41.100
THIS LAND THERE IS LEGAL

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:41.633
OPPORTUNE DE THE NOBODY IS

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.336
TOUCHING. AND WE CAN TALK A

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:44.970
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY THIS

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:46.038
IS SO IMPORTANT. AND IT IS

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:46.805
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:49.174
MAP OF THE DIABLO RANGE. WHICH

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:50.709
COMES OFF MOUNT DIABLO IN DOWN

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.644
THE STATE THIS IS A PINCH POINT

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:53.879
FOR THE ANIMALS THAT ARE

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.547
MIGRATING. AND WHEN WE TURN

00:16:55.614 --> 00:16:56.915
THIS INTO AN OFFERED VEHICLE

00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:57.783
PARK WE WILL CLOSE THAT

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.151
MIGRATION PATTERNS. AND

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:00.853
CURRENTLY THIS PIECE OF THE

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:03.055
LAND IS USED BY THOSE ANIMALS.

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.022
AND AGAIN THERE'S IN

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.124
NEIGHBORING PIECE OF LAND THEY

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.325
ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO AND WILL

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:08.427
CONTINUE TO BE ALLOWED TO.

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:09.595
RECORD ON THEY WON'T HAVE TO

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:10.162
DRIVE ANY FURTHER THAN THEY

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:12.398
CURRENTLY DRIVE. BUT YOU KNOW

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:13.465
THIS PIECE OF LAND LIKE YOU

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:16.535
SAID HAS INCREDIBLE. IMPORTANCE

00:17:16.602 --> 00:17:18.170
TO THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:19.772
DIABLO RANGE AND THAT'S WHY

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.340
WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THIS PIECE

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:22.674
BUT OF COURSE THEY HAVE THE

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:25.477
MONEY THEY WILL HAVE THE MONEY

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:26.044
RETURNED TO THEM. TO CREATE

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:27.079
ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. YOU

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:29.748
KNOW I WOULD BE MORE

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:30.349
COMFORTABLE SUPPORT. THE BILL

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:33.252
SHOULD THERE BE SOME. I'M

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:34.253
PLACE. AND WORK ON TERMS OF A

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.955
REQUIREMENT OF. THE IN EITHER A

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:37.890
NEARBY ORIGINATION AREAS THIS

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:40.125
P. REPLACES PART OF KIND OF THE-

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.194
MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.796
IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IF THIS

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:45.798
IS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE ENORMOUS

00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:46.365
ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE I THINK

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:49.668
THAT SHOULD. DOT THAT SHOULD

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:53.238
TAKE PRECEDENCE HOWEVER. IN

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:55.541
REGARDS TO THESE RECREATION

00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:56.108
AREAS I'VE ALWAYS NOTED THAT

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:59.912
HAVE BEEN. AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:00.479
WOULD RECREATION WILL WOULD

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:04.416
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T. OF. I

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:06.518
DON'T INTEND TO DON'T TRY TO

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.086
RECREATION AREAS THAT ARE

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:09.154
SENSITIVE HABITAT WHERE THEY

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:10.088
SHOULDN'T BE RECREATION AND

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:13.025
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:14.359
PROBLEM IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:17.396
I HAVE A VERY LARGE DISTRICT

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:18.764
THAT OCCURRED AT THAT INCLUDES

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.567
SOME SOME VERY IMPORTANT BARMAN

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:24.036
HABITAT THAT AFFECTS CERTAIN

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:27.372
SPECIES THAT ARE OF THREATENED

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:30.542
AND- ENDANGERED. AND PEOPLE

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.810
JUST GO OUT THERE RECREATION

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:33.645
BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY HAVE

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.047
VERY VERY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES

00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:37.049
AND SOME VERY LARGE GEOGRAPHIC

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:38.717
AREAS. WHERE YOU CREATE AN

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:39.818
OPPORTUNITY AND MAKE IT

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:42.588
ACCESSIBLE THEY'RE LESS LIKELY

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:44.356
TO GO OUT INTO THE OPEN SPACE

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:47.192
AND ENVIRONMENT AND CAUSE HARM.

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:47.793
AND SO ANY CHANCE THAT WE CAN

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.430
DO THAT THAT. HAS ENVIRONMENTAL

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:52.831
VALUE AND IF IT'S WORKED INTO A

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:55.634
PLAN. THAT COULD WE COULD

00:18:55.701 --> 00:19:00.873
ENSURE THAT. ONCE YOU SELL THIS

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:01.440
LANNISTER TO TRY TO DEVELOP

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:03.775
ANOTHER THE SAME PEOPLE THAT.

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:04.943
HELP YOU ACQUIRE IS LOUDER THAN

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.646
OPPOSE THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:09.314
FOR THE STATE TO REPLACE THE

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:11.183
SASSER UNLESS IT'S UNLESS IT'S

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.519
PART. OF AN AGREEMENT THAT

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:15.454
SHOULD THIS LAND BE SOLD THAT

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:17.155
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PUT THOSE

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.657
MONIES IN THOSE FUNDS BECAUSE

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.993
THOSE FUNDS COULD BE RIGHT UP.

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:25.364
IN LAWSUITS. OF FOR YEARS AND

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.566
I'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN WITH.

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:30.168
URBAN PROJECTS LIBRARIES AND

00:19:30.235 --> 00:19:32.004
PARKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.906
GET. HELD UP IN IN LITIGATION

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:37.609
FOR YEARS. THROUGH KIND OF THE

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.211
SEQUEL PROCESS OF SEQUEL WE

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:40.979
WANT TO WE WANT USED TO PROTECT

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.981
LAND BUT IT'S OFTEN SICK WAS

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:46.752
OFTEN ABUSED. AND I'M CONCERNED

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:48.954
ABOUT THAT WITH REGARD TO THIS

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:49.488
MEASURE THROUGH THE CHAIR

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:53.125
CENTER. PLEASE I'M STILL

00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:55.894
ACTIVATIONS THAT CENTER HUESO

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:56.395
ONE IS THAT THE OFF ROAD

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:59.097
VEHICLE COMMISSION. MADE OF

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:01.033
ENTHUSIASTS AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:02.167
OF PARKS AND REC ARE IN CHARGE

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:04.136
HERE NOT THAT NOTHING IN THIS

00:20:04.202 --> 00:20:04.770
BILL CHANGES THAT THEY GET TO

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:07.139
DECIDE WHAT'S BEST. FOR THIS

00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:09.675
PROJECT OR TO LET MAKE A

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:10.542
DECISION THAT MAYBE WOULD BE

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:12.744
BEST TO SELL THE LAND OKAY SO

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:15.914
THEY THEY REMAIN IN CHARGE NOW

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:17.549
AND IN THE FUTURE. SECOND THING

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:19.851
IS THAT ANY MONEY THAT'S

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:21.553
DEPOSITED BACK INTO THE H. B.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.656
FIND BY LAW IS RESTRICTED IN

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:26.558
ITS USE. UNLESS WE CHANGE THE

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:29.962
LAW IT HAS TO BE A PROVIDED FOR

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:32.097
THAT ACTIVITY WHEREVER IT'S DE

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:33.932
DESIGNATED TO BE USED FOR AS I

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.567
MENTIONED I WANTED TO BE USED

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:36.435
FOR THAT ACTIVITY NOT TRY TIED

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:39.304
UP AND LAWSUITS WELL THAT'S OF

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.106
COURSE THE PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:42.941
FACING TODAY. IS THAT THE LAND

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:47.145
IS TIED UP IN WHAT. AND THAT

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:48.146
THE- DEPARTMENT DOES AN OPTION

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:49.114
TODAY IF THEY SAID WE WERE

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:49.781
SPENDING MILLIONS ON THE

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:50.515
LAWYERS. THIS DOESN'T MAKE

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:51.149
SENSE THERE'S ALREADY OFF ROAD%

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:53.118
RIGHT THERE. A MINUTE AWAY THAT

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:54.753
PEOPLE CAN USE WITH DECLINING.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.788
ATTENDANCE SO WE CAN STILL

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.223
MAINTAIN THAT ACTIVITY RIGHT

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.124
THERE IN THE AREA FOR THE

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:01.026
PEOPLE THAT ARE ENJOYING IT.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:01.627
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:02.995
SPEND MILLIONS IN LAWYER FEES

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:05.364
NOW. WHEN WE CAN CUT OUR LOSSES
