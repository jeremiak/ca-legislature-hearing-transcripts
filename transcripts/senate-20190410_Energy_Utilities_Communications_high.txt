SO WE'RE GONNA GET THE MEETING STARTED. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS. BOB MADAM CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLE [inaudible] WITH SO. HERE WAS A PRESENT MORE LOT. MORE LIKE PRESENT BRADFORD. PRESENT CHIANG DIED. PRESENT HERTZBERG ILL. ILL PRESENT MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER -- PRESENT STERN. STONE WIENER. WHEN I PRESENT YOU SAY HERE? ONE NINE I I WAS CHANGING MY WAYS [inaudible] HI. I'M TRYING TO YEAH AUTO. GOING ON HERE. WE'RE GONNA START WITH SB FORTY NINE SENATOR SKINNER WELCOME. THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- FIRST I HAPPILY ACCEPTED COMMITTEES MEMONS EXCELLENT -- SB FORTY NINE OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE MANY NEW TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS LIKE APPS AND SMART FINANCES. THAT. CUSTOMERS TO CONNECT WITH THEIR SMART METERS. AND CHIEF BETTER ENERGY DEMANDS MANAGEMENT. SO WHY IS IT THAT WE NEED BETTER DEMAND MANAGEMENT. AS ALL OF US KNOW CALIFORNIA NOW HAS A 100%. GOAL TO ACHIEVE. BE A 100% OF OUR ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES. AS WE ALSO KNOW RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY EXCEPT FOR A FEW OF LIKE GEO THERMAL IS NOT. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SO IF WE CAN. MODIFY WHEN ELECTRICITY DEMAND IS SO WE CAN REDUCE IT PEAK. THEN WE ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE OUR RENEWABLE RESOURCES BETTER. AND HAVE LESS DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUEL BACK UP. NOW WHAT IS THE BILL EXPLICITLY DUE TO OPEN UP THESE OPPORTUNITY. OUR ENERGY COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY NOW TO SET APPOINT STANDARDS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. HOWEVER THEY CANNOT SET STANDARDS TO ENCOURAGE THOSE POINTS IS TO BE WHAT WE CALL SMART. SO IN OTHER WORDS SO THOSE APPLIANCES ARE ABLE TO BE REMOTELY. IMPACT REMOTELY CONTROLLED OFF ON LOWERING. LEFT FOR EXAMPLE WITH AN AIR CONDITIONER LOWERING THE TEMPERATURE ARE INCREASING THE TEMPERATURE OR HOWEVER. SO WHAT THIS DOES IS ALLOWS THE CDC TO INCLUDE -- SETTING OF BUILDING CODE STANDARDS FOR OUR EXCUSE ME APPLIANCE STANDARDS FOR DEMAND RESPONSE MEANING SUPPORTING THOSE SMART APPLIANCES. AND CLARIFYING THAT THE CDC CAN CONSIDER GREENHOUSE GASES BECAUSE IF THE C. E. C. IN SETTING THE STANDARDS. CAN ONLY INCORPORATE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IT DOES NOT ALLOW. FOR MOVING DEMAND ISN'T NECESSARILY A ROOF A A A REDUCTION IN ELECTRICITY USE IT'S MORE JUST THE SHIFTING OF WHEN WE USE THAT ELECTRICITY. SO THAT'S WHY THE BILL. ALLOWS THE CDC TO HAVE THAT OTHER AUTHORITY. SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES SPEAK I'VE GOT -- LILLIAN MURDERS FROM OWN CONNECT AN ERROR IN THE MILLER FROM THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND RESPONSE COUNCIL. GREAT THANK YELL GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LILLIAN MARVIS I AM A GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER WITH HOME CONNECT. OR A RESIDENTIAL DEMAND RESPONSE A SOFTWARE COMPANY AND WE SUPPORT SB FORTY NINE I CENTER SKINNER YOU ACTUALLY. SAID IT PERFECTLY I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT. HI. ESSENTIALLY AS MORE NOBLES COME ONLINE WITH SB FIVE ONE HUNDRED LIKE CENTER CENTER SAD. THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEED TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMER DEMAND MEETS SUPPLY WHEN ITS CLEANNESS AND WHEN IT'S PREDOMINATELY RENEWABLE ENERGY. CURRENTLY A WHAT SB FORTY NINE PROPOSES IS THAT IT MAKES OF ISIS SMARTER SO RIGHT NOW THE WAY DEVICES WORK AS WE TURN ELECTRONICS ON AND ON BASED ON WHEN. WE WANT TO USE ENERGY. INSTEAD AS BEFORE NINE ENSURES THAT THESE DEVICES ARE GREAT CONNECTED AND THEY RESPOND IN REAL TIME TO GREAT CONDITIONS SO SPECIFICALLY WHEN THE GREAT IS ASSN FIND PREDOMINATELY RENEWABLES. WHAT OWN CONNECT IS MOSTLY EXCITED ABOUT IS? THAT ENSURES THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IN THIS ROOM HERE RIGHT NOW CAN BE A PART OF CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION AND HELP WITH THE INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLES. SO EMPOWERS US TO BE A PART OF THE SMART GRID OF THE FUTURE. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THEM THANK YOU. MR TURN. GO AHEAD YEAH MR TERM MEMBERS THEIR NAME A LOT REPRESENTING THE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL BEEN SAID SO BE VERY QUICK. BASICALLY THIS ALLOWS US TO USE OUR ABUNDANT NATURAL RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WELL IN ABUNDANCE -- DURING THE DAY SOLAR POWER AND SHIFTED THAT THE CONSUMER LOAD ON THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE EQUATION TO UTILIZE THOSE RESOURCES IN A WY THAT REDUCES OR MAINTAINS A LOW GHG PROFILE AND SO FOR THIS REASON WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU OKAY. I DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. HOW ABOUT SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION? WE HAVE SUPPORTER. FOR CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. OKAY ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. RAISE YOUR HAND ANY OF THOSE OKAY NONE. OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT'S A PLEASURE COMMITTEE. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DID YOU WANNA MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT -- DO YOU PASS IS AMENDED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE WEST SO I WAS SO I MORE NOT [inaudible] BRADFORD. BRADFORD I CHANGE. DODD. DODD AYE HERTZBERG ILL. ILL I MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE STERN DOWN -- NO WIENER. WIENER AYE. OKAY WILL HOLD THE ROLL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS -- WHEN WE GOT HERE [inaudible] ARCHULETA GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MARKET HOW ARE YOU GOOD THANK YOU. AND GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- I'M HERE BEFORE YOU -- SB. SIX SIX TWO AND I'D LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO DO THIS TODAY I HAVE BEFORE YOU SENATE BILL. SIX SIX TWO WHICH WOULD ALLOW INVESTOR OWNED ELECTRICAL UTILITIES TO MEET THEIR TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION MANDATE BY INVESTING IN RENEWABLE HYDROGEN. AS A NATION FUEL IN ADDITION TO THEIR CURRENT SINGULAR COMPLIANCE PATHWAY. OF INVESTMENTS IN BATTERY ELECTRIC CHARGING PROJECTS. I THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND FROM DO YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. VERY WELL. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY IMPOSED A MANDATE. THAT UTILITIES DO THEIR SHARE TO CLEAN UP OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AN OVERDUE AND MUCH NEEDED STEP TO CLEAN UP THE AIR. THIS BILL MEANT TO GO TO COMPLEMENT THE GROUND BREAKING STRIDES MADE BY MADE UNDER SB. THREE FIFTY BY BRINGING ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY TO THE FRAY IN A ADDING AN ADDITIONAL WEAPON TO OUR ARSENAL INTO THE FIGHT TO REDUCE RECITATION RELATED EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. SB SIX SIX TWO DOES NOT IMPOSE ADDITIONAL MANDATE ON UTILITIES BUT RATHER ADDS AN ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE PATHWAY. FOR THEIR EXISTING MANDATES. THIS BILL WITH THE WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ACCEPTED TODAY WILL NOT ADD COST TO THE TAX CODE TO THE RATE PAYERS. THIS BILL WILL HOWEVER FACILITATE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL STANCE ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION AND ALLOW FOR RENEWABLE HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY. TO PLAY A ROLE IN HELPING US ACHIEVE OUR ADMISSION REDUCTION GOALS IN CALIFORNIA. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE JAKE DONAHUE AND CAN SENSE AND WITH BILLARD FUEL SYSTEMS. AT THE SPONSORED THIS BILL. AND THEY THEY WILL BE THE TECHNICAL RESPONSE THAT YOU MAY HAVE [inaudible] AND AGAIN -- I THANK VERY WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY TESTIMONY THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SHARE. MISTER. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHECK ON HE ONLY HAVE BALLARD POWER SYSTEMS THE SPONSORS SENATE BILL SIX SIX TWO AS WELL AS SOME LIKE TRANSIT AGENCY ONE OF THE MANY INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS ON OUR SUPPORTERS FOR THIS BILL. TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION IN ITS MOST BASIC SENSE IS MEANT TO MEAN TURNING OUR ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR ZERO MISSION TECHNOLOGY. THAT CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC ALONE. THERE ARE PARTS OF THAT SECTOR THAT REMAIN UNREACHABLE BY BATTERY ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY. INSTEAD HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY HAS PROVEN THE MOST FEASIBLE OPTION FOR MANY OPERATORS IN THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY ARENAS SUCH AS BUSES TRUCKS. MARINE VESSELS IN LOCOMOTIVES THE LONG ROUTES OPERATING TIMES EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND HIGH TORQUE AND HORSEPOWER NEEDS ARE JUST A FEW. REASONS WHY FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN NEEDED IN THESE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SETTINGS. WITHOUT INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE HYDROGEN THOSE SETTINGS WERE NEEDS CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY MET MY BATTERY TECHNOLOGY. WILL LIKELY BE SETTINGS THAT REMAIN POWERED BY DIESEL. AND OTHER NON ZERO MISSION POWER TRAINS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE LEGISLATURE STATED GOALS FOR THE FUTURE. WE WANT TO ECHO THE AUTHOR STATEMENT OF THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE STAFFER THEY'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH US ON GETTING THIS BILL IN SHAPE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DIALOGUE. WITH OUR FRIENDS AT THE AFFECTED UTILITIES TO NSURE THIS BILL CONTINUES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE AUTHOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE DRY BOTH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I JUST WANNA. I BRING THE AMENDMENT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THE MEMBERS HAVE THE AMENDMENT ONE OF THEM. JUST IN CASE SOMEONE AT A MAKE THE AMENDMENT THE AMENDMENT -- TO THIS BILL WOULD BE TO AUTHORIZE THE CPUC TO APPROVE GREEN. ELECTROLYTIC. HI HYDROGEN PROPOSALS. TO THE EXTENT OF THE PROS POLLS ARE COST EFFECTIVE PAIRS HELP MEET CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS. AND DO NOT RESULT IN DUPLICATIVE INVESTMENTS. AS THE MEN. THAT WERE SUGGESTING THAT THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED. THOSE IN THE PUBLIC. WHO ARE NOT PRIVY TO THAT AMENDMENT WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE? YOU AWARE. OF SUPPORTERS OF THE MEASURE MAY -- YES ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIM SAYS SCENE WITH BALLARD FUEL CELL SYSTEMS. I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT OF BALLARD THE GLOBAL LEADER IN FUEL CELL MANUFACTURING FOR TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS SEPARATE CELEBRATING OUR FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL INDUSTRY WE HAVE A SPONSOR THIS. AND BELIEVE THAT IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE TO BRING PARITY IN CALIFORNIA ZERO MISSION INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS VISION AND PRESSING THE VITAL ROLE THAT HIGH HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY MUST PLAY IN CALIFORNIA'S EFORTS TO TRANSFORM HIS TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE AS A RESOURCE AND ALONG WITH THE AUTHOR MY COLLEAGUE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. WELL WE'RE GONNA BRING. IN FAVOR SPEAKERS [inaudible] NONE. ARE YOU IN FAVOR. BASKETBALL CAN BE AT THE CENTER OF TRANSPORTATION ENVIRONMENT -- ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL NURTURED. THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROXANA BACK ON HOW MANY WITH MANACOR ADVOCACY -- I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF GOLDEN GATE AND AS ZERO EMISSION MARINE AS WELL AS RED WHITE FLEET. THEY ARE END USERS IN MANUFACTURES ZERO EMISSION VESSELS AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VALERIE TURN LOVE Là HOSE WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY. WE HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION WE ARE VERY EXCITED THAT THE AUTHOR HAS BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD THERE'S A LOT OF HYDROGEN WORK GOING ON HERE AND GLOBALLY -- BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT -- THE HYDROGEN INITIATIVES ARE CONSIDERED IN THIS BILL COMPLEMENT AND DON'T COMPETE WITH OUR TURNED. I'M GOALS SO -- TO SEE SOME OF THE COST EFFECTIVE AND REPAIR PROTECTIONS -- IN THE BILL -- WE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT AS A MANDATE -- AND FINALLY WE WE ARE PLEASE AT THE AUTHOR IS -- PROPOSING A TECH TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL -- APPROACH TO THIS NAY SENT -- TECHNOLOGY WE'RE PLEASED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE -- AT THE AUTHOR AND THE AND THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. I SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. AND IF WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM HERE ON THE DIES. GOOD MORNING HERE IN WESTERN MEMBERS -- NEEDED FOR THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WE REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MEMBERS IN EVERY SECTOR OF THE ARE IN G. INDUSTRY INCLUDING ORGANIZED LABOR. UTILITIES AND THE PRODUCERS OF OVER 90% OF THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IN NORTH AMERICA -- WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVE A TWEENER POSITION TODAY WERE NOT AN OFFICIAL -- OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE'RE HOPING TO WORK THROUGH THIS ISSUE I'M WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WE AGREE WITH CENTER ARE TO LET ITS GOAL. OF ADDING HYDROGEN TO STATUTES THAT INCENTIVIZE THE USE IT'S YOUR MISSION VEHICLES -- BUT AS YOU'RE ACTUALLY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE DEFINITION IN THIS BILL. EXCLUDES SEVERAL OTHER FORMS OF RENEWABLE AND NON FOSSEL HYDROGEN MANY OF THEM -- ARE MORE MATURE AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE INCLUDING -- RENEWABLE HYDROGEN MADE FROM RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WHO ARE THE FOLKS THAT I REPRESENT [inaudible] I'M. AS FOR ME GIVE ME NOW SAYS ALSO POINTS OUT THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THIS YOU'LL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO VERY WIDELY ACCORDING TO FEED STOCK. I'M SOME OF THAT MAY BE TAKEN CARE OF BY THE AMENDMENTS BUT THE IRONY HERE IS THAT BY EXCLUDING RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS ARE ACTUALLY. EXCLUDING HYDROGEN THAT HAS A NEGATIVE CARBON INTENSITY AND LIMITING IT ONLY TWO ZERO THEREFORE ANY CONFLICTING WITH OUR AYE MICHAELS AND SO. OUT WE WOULD ASK THAT THIS. BILL BE CHANGED. TO INCLUDE SOME OF THESE OTHER FORMS OF RENEWABLE NON POSSO HYDROGEN EITHER BY CALLING IT OUT THAT WAY OR ANOTHER WAYS THAT IT'S NOT LIMITED TO ONLY ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. OKAY VERY WELL OF COMMITTEE. CENTER SKINNER THANK YOU. I'M I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL I AM. WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THAT LAST YEAR ALLOWED US TO TREAT A DEFINITION OF GREEN ELECTROLYTIC ARTESIAN. I DO THINK THAT THE POINT AROUND THE OTHER ëEWABLE HYDROGEN. ALLOWING THEM TO BE USED IN OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. IS A VALID POINT. AND I THINK THAT IS WORTH THE AUTHORS. I IN SPONSOR'S CONSIDERATION I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HANG THE BILL UP NOW BUT I THINK THAT IS A VERY WORTHWHILE CONSIDERATION. ON AND I AM ALSO I UNDERSTAND WHY THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN AS A CLEAN -- EITHER ELECTRICITY GENERATION SOURCE OR TRANSPORTATION SOURCE GOT HUNG UP. BECAUSE FOR YEARS WE WHEN -- RENEWABLE BASED ELECTRICITY WAS VERY HIGH COST. IT WAS NOT COST EFFECTIVE TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN TO THAT MEANS AND WE WERE MOSTL PRODUCING HYDROGEN THROUGH. A POSSIBLE FROM A LOSS OF YOUR POWER SOURCE SO IN FACT WE WERE NOT GETTING MUCH PARDON BENEFIT FROM HYDROGEN. BUT NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY UTILIZE IT IN FACT. ANYTIME WERE OVER GENERATING ELECTRICITY. I'M THAT IS GENERATED FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES IT ALLOWS US NOW TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN WHICH CAN THEN SUPPLANT. ANY FOSSIL FUEL WHETHER IT'S IN TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER WHICH IS REALLY THE TYPE OF CLEAN ENERGY DIVERSITY WE WANT TO ACHIEVE. SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT AND INTERESTINGLY. I USED TO RUN A PROJECT THAT -- WAS PROMOTING THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND BACK IN -- NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WE DID A DEMONSTRATION OF BALLARD FUEL CELL BUSES IN CHICAGO. AND THEN MAYOR DALEY CUP UNDER THE BE A TAIL PIPE. AND DRINK THE EMISSIONS SO THAT WAS ONE TV. UNFORTUNATELY ARJUN FUEL CELL BUSES DID NOT TAKE OFF THE WAY I THINK SOME OF US HOPE BUT WE WE ARE SEEING THAT TECHNOLOGY. A VERY VERY AVAILABLE AND WE ARE SEEING NOW THE ABILITY TO POWER IT WITH OUR RENEWABLE SOURCES SO WITH THAT I MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT SENATOR YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WILL NOT ADD COSTS TO RATEPAYERS BUT MY RESEARCH IS SHOWING THAT IT WILL SO DID YOU. HELP EXPLAIN BERMAN TURNOUT DOES IT TO THAT THE TECHNICIAN HERE. AND YOU CAN AFTER THAT. CERTAINLY YEAH THE KEY HERE IS PRODUCTION OF ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN AT A UTILITY SCALE SO AS WE CAN PRODUCE HYDROGEN FROM ELECTRICITY COSTED BELOW FIVE CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR WHICH YOU CAN ACHIEVE. FOR PEAVEY AND WIN INSTALLATIONS GREATER THAN A HUNDRED MEGAWATTS YOU GET TO HYDROGEN THAT'S PRODUCED AT BELOW PARITY COMPARED TO ELECTRICAL RESOURCES EVEN WHEN YOU KHôNG CAPITAL. AMORTIZED OVER TEN YEARS THAT AS ABOUT FIFTY CENTS PER KILOGRAM SO BECOMES QUITE AFFORDABLE. THE KEY POINT FOR ELECTRIFICATION WE LOOK AT SB. ONE HUNDRED MOVING UP TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE FULL EDUCATION WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO QUINN OPPLE OR QUADRUPLE THE RENEWABLE GENERATION. IN CALIFORNIA IF WE DO THAT ALL WITH LITHIUM ION TECHNOLOGY WE'RE LOKING AT ELECTRIFYING AREAS OF THE GRID THAT ARE ALREADY VERY ENERGY INTENSE LIKE THE LA BASIN. LIKE THE BAY AREA DOING THAT COST EFFECTIVELY AND IN WAYS THAT DO NOT INCREASE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO WILDFIRES OUTAGES IS GONNA BE VERY CHALLENGING AND IT'S WORTHWHILE FOR THE UTILITIES TO HAVE THE OPTION. FOR PRODUCING FUEL IN REMOTE AREAS FROM NEW INSTALLATIONS OF WIND AND SOLAR AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE THOSE IN WAYS THAT DON'T REQUIRE NEW HIGH TENSION LINES NEW. TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE IN AREAS WHERE IT MAKES SENSE. AND IN THAT WAY IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR HE RATE PAYERS TO HAVE THOSE OPTIONS AT THEIR DISPOSAL SO THE ANSWER IS MAYBE. THE ANSWER IS A DEFINITE YES. WE HAVE THE ALTERNATIVE AD RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDED A HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MILLION WHAT WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT PROGRAM. SO THE CDC HAS FUNDED A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES IN IN RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION -- THEY HAVE. FUNDED PRIMARILY -- BATTERY ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGIES AND THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT ON AN ONGOING BASIS SINCE -- THAT INITIATIVE PASSED THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN FUNDING THAT PROGRAM AT CC. SO THEY HAVE BEEN ON AN ONGOING BASIS FUNDING PROGRAMS RELATING TO BATTERY ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SOME. IN THE HYDROGEN SPACES WELL BUT THE DISPARITY AND THE GAP IS WIDE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TOTAL STATEWIDE INVESTMENTS IN BATTERY ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY. AND ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION IN HYDROGEN -- AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN ORDER FOR HYDROGEN TO FILL THOSE GAPS THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY THANK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AS ONE OF BLOOD YOU. FOR IT WAS SOME SOLUTION. WHEN THINGS ON THE TABLE I MEAN YOU KNOW? IN WHERE YOU ARE YOU REPRESENT. PARTS LA I REPRESENT. SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE COUNTRY. I THINK WE'RE THE RICHEST STATE IN IN THE WORLD AND YET. KIDS YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL WITH ASTHMA EVERY DAY NUMBER ONE BECAUSE IT'S WELL SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. IS CHILDHOOD ASKED SO THIS EVEN TO PUT THIS KIND OF TECH SOLUTION FOR AYE AYE WHY ONE OF BY JOHN IT. AND I KNOW YOU'RE YOU WORK HARD FOR YOU FOLKS THIS WILL BENEFIT. ALL CALIFORNIA -- SO I'D LOVE THE SENATE AS A CO AUTHOR IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME IN JUST APPRECIATE YOU. PUT IN SOME WHEN YOUR SHOULDER THAT WE ON THIS PLANE TRANSPORTATION PUZZLE BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO SOLVE AND AND REPORTS OF LA ALL THROUGH THAT SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR AND ALL THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SOUTH LND LIKE THIS STUFF IS HARD AND HEAVY DUTY SIZE OF TOUGH PUZZLE TO SOLVE. AND IT'S NOT THE SAME WAYS ALL THE LIKE DO SO. I APPRECIATE THE DIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY BOARD AND LEAD TO JOIN HIS PARTNER. THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU OKAY -- JUST GENERALLY -- CONCERNING THE THE THE COMMENTS THAT WERE RECENTLY MADE -- BY -- BY BUT THE BIO GAS ASSOCIATION IT WOULD BEHOOVE US AS THE STATE TO INCLUDE ALL. TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP US ACHIEVE OUR OUR EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS -- AND WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A POLICY IN THE STATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL SO I THINK IT WOULD BE YOU'D BE WELL SERVED WE'D ALL BE WELL SERVED IF YOU WORK WITH THAT ASSOCIATION SEE HOW. THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED -- WE DIDN'T COMPLETELY. ADDRESS IT WITH OUR COMMITTEE -- AMENDMENTS I THINK THEY GO A LONG WAY TO ADDRESSING NOT BUT NOT. IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT WAS LEFT OUT MAYBE YOU CAN WORK THAT OUT FOR INFO ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS I THINK THAT'LL HELP YOU. DOWN THE ROAD. TO GET THIS BILL TO THE GOVERNOR'S TASK. BECAUSE THAT'S GENERALLY HOW -- OUR STATE HAS LINED UP ANYWAY IT'S JUST A VERY -- CONSISTENT POLICY THAT WE'VE APPROVED HERE -- WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION -- CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HE PASSES AMENDED TO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE WEST SO. I WAS SO I AM MORE LOCK. BRADFORD [inaudible] CHIANG. DODD AYE DODD AYE HERTZBERG HILL. MCGUIRE RUBIO. THE AYE SKINNER. SKINNER AYE STERN STERN AYE STONE. STONE NO WIENER WIENER AYE. SIX ONE OKAY WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THE ROLE OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW IF WE CAN HAVE CENTER DOT. SURE THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE THE I. BOLT THANK YOU SENATOR DR NUMBER YEAR YES NO. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EXTREME WEATHER IS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IN THE LAKE TO THE WILDFIRE SEASON. YEARS OF DROUGHT RESULTING IN MILLIONS OF DEAD TREES FOLLOWED BY SUBSTANTIAL VEGETATION GROWTH DURING A RECORD SET A WET WINTER. BECAME WILDFIRE FUEL DURING RECORD SETTING HEAT VERY LOW HUMIDITY AND VERY HIGH WINDS. ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE TWELVE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WERE CAUSED BY ELECTRIC POWER IN DISTRIBUTION LIVES CONDUCTORS AND POWER POLES. CAL FIRE CITED TREES OR PARTS OF TREES FALLING ON THE POWER LINES AS SPECIFIC CLAUSES OF THE FIRES. ADEQUATE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING THE RISK OF TREES AND BRUSH CONTACTING ELECTRIC LINES AND EQUIPMENT. PART OF CALPERS MISSION IS TO PREVENT FIRES CAL FIRE FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAM INCLUDES WILDLAND FIRE. SKEWS ME WILD LAND THREE FIRE ENGINEERING. IN MANAGEMENT FIRE PLANNING EDUCATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. CAL FIRE UNIQUELY SITUATED TO DETERMINE WHAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE LEVEL WHILE FAR REST FROM CONTACT WITH THE LET'S CLIENTS. IN A QUICK BIT. ADD TO ENSURE THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS SUFFICIENTLY IMPLEMENTED. SB TWO FORTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE CAL FIRE TO PROVIDE EACH ELECTRICAL CORPORATION WITH A LIST OF ALL TREES AND OTHER VEGETATION TO BE REMOVED OR TRAM. TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CPC AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND REDUCE THE LEVEL WILD FIRE RISK. FROM CONTACT WITH ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS ELECTRIC LINES AND EQUIPMENT. HOW FAR WOULD ALSO ON EACH ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH CAL FIRES LIST? THIS IS MORE WORK FOR CAL FIRE THE CALIFORNIA BE REIMBURSED. BY THE UTILITY FOR ALL ITS COST INCLUDING ANY NEW RESOURCES NEEDED SO IT'S ABILITY TO PERFORM ITS OTHER DUTIES. WILL NOT BE IMPAIRED. MILEY BECAUSE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK IS VERY DANGEROUS. SB TWO FORTY SEVEN ALSO REQUIRES THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK BE PERFORMED BY QUALIFIED LYING% CLEARANCE TREE TRIMMERS OR CLARENCE STREET DRUMMER TRAINEES. JUST THE OTHER DAY JUDGE ELSA OVERSEEING P. GENIES PROBATION IN THE SAN BRUNO CASE SAID. P. JEANNIE HAS NOT CUT THE RIGHT TREES. IN RESPONSE P. JEANNIE SAID AND I QUOTE. THERE'S A LOT OF TREES OUT THERE AND WE DON'T HAVE EYES ON ALL OF THEM. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I SUBMIT LET'S GIVE THE ELECTRICAL UTILITIES THE EYES THEY NEED TO ADEQUATELY MANAGE VEGETATION. AND CUT THE RIGHT TREES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. MISTER CHAIRMAN REMEMBER SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. WE'RE WORKING SPONSORING THE BILL WITH WITH SENATOR DODD. WE BELIEVE WE REPRESENT ALL OF THE LINE CLEAR IT'S A TREE TRIMMERS IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- TECHNICIANS FOR ALL THREE THE UTILITIES. WE ALSO REPRESENT THE FOLKS WHO DO THESE INSPECTIONS. SO SHIFTING THIS RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE UTILITY. TO CAL FIRE ACTUALLY COST US JOBS. BUT WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO [inaudible] BECAUSE AS WE SAW SEVENTEEN FIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE DETERMINED BY CAL FIRE TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BECAUSE IN THEIR VIEW. THERE WAS AN APPROPRIATE TREE CLEARANCE IT WAS PERFORMED BY THE COMPANY AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A RESPONSE. A RESPONSIBLE WAY TO ADDRESS THAT [inaudible] SECONDLY. ON THE THE THE HE WORK FORCE THAT WE THAT WE REPRESENT IN THE TREE TRIMMING AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. IS A MOSTLY IMMIGRANT WORKFORCE IT'S A LOW WAGE WORKFORCE UNFORTUNATELY. AND THEIR SUFFERING. GREAT HARM [inaudible] AN ABUSE. NOT BUT UTILITIES BUT BY MANY OF THE SECOND AND THIRD TIER SUBCONTRACTORS THAT ARE CONTRACTED TO GO OUT AND DO THE TREE TRIMMING. AND BRUSH CLEARANCE. WE'VE GONE FROM HAVING A THOUSAND MEMBERS WORKING IN THAT AREA AT P. JEANNIE. TO TH OVER THREE THOUSAND IN SIX MONTHS THAT'S HOW QUICKLY THEY'VE BEEN HIRING THAT CONTRACTORS ARE COMING FROM OTHER STATES LITERALLY. WITH LIKE TWENTY TRUCKS AND NO EMPLOYEES. AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY SHOW UP AND GOT A FULL CREW. THESE WORKERS ARE NOT BEING TRAINED APPROPRIATELY. HOPING TO GET THE LATEST INFORMATION AND DATA FROM CAL OSHA. BUT THE NUMBERS ARE ALARMING FROM OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWELVE TO SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT'S LESS THAN TWO YEARS. SEVENTY FOUR SERIOUS ACCIDENTS. FIFTY FOUR REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION. AND ELEVEN DEATHS. OUR INTERNAL RECORDS INDICATE THAT THOSE NUMBERS. ARE A LITTLE FAR FEWER THAN WHAT'S OCCURRED IN THE LAST SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS. BECAUSE THIS IS A MIGRANT WORKFORCE. OF AB PREDOMINATELY SPANISH SPEAKING. THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS GO WOEFULLY UNDER REPORTED BECAUSE OF INTIMIDATION FROM THE CONTRACTORS. OR FEAR FOR THEIR FAMILIES IF THEY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. SO THIS WORK FORCE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THEY GO OUT INTO THE WOODS. AND THEY HAVE SOME NEW HIRE WHO SUPPOSED TO ONLY BE CLEARING BRUSH [inaudible] HAULING DEBRIS. AND ONCE THEY GET A LIKE BACKWARDS THE CONTRACTOR HANDSOME CHAINSAW IS AS GO CUT SOME TREES. WE HAVE A MEMBER OF OURS DIE BECAUSE OF LACK OF TRAINING JUST A MONTH AGO. FROM PULLING A TREE OVER ON HIMSELF BECAUSE HE DIDN'T REALIZE THE APPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS TO DO THAT SO WITH THE WITH THE SENATORS LEGISLATION WOULD DO. IS REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO INVEST MONEY INTO TRAINING OF THESE WORKERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY GO OUT INTO THE WOODS AND THAT THEY'RE SAFER. AND ALSO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT OUR WORKERS COMP LAWS AND HOW THEY REPORT ACCIDENTS -- IS WHICH THIS IS A CRITICAL BECAUSE THIS WORKFORCE IS BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THANK YOU. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY IN PLACE AND HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OR A VERY WELL -- SUPPORTERS ANY OTHER SUPPORTERS. SUPPORTERS OF YOU CAN MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE MIKE NOW. SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. MORNING CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M KAREN MILLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION IN FACT WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL. BEEN WORKING WITH THE UTHORS OFFICE IN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE WE HAVE WITH THE OFFICE -- TWO THERE ARE CONCERNS AND REFLECT CONCERNS ABOUT THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THIS BILL WOULD. COUNTENANCE ON ALL TREES IN THE SERVICE TERRITORIES WHICH INCLUDES ORCHARD TREES WHICH ARE MEMBERS -- HAVE AN ABUNDANCE SEVEN ARE DISSECTED BY DISTRIBUTION TRANSMISSION. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OPPONENTS OF THIS [inaudible] NO. HELLO JOHN KENNEDY'S WITH RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING -- UNFORTUNATELY HAVING OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- POSITION ON THIS BILL OUR MEMBER COUNTIES HAVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S WORST LANDS IN THE BORN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CAST CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN RECENT YEARS SO WE'RE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO REDUCE WILD VIRUS. WE SUPPORT THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS WHEN IT COMES TO AUDITING UTILITIES VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND EVEN SEE UTILITY FOR SOME TYPE OF TREMULOUS BUT WE THINK THE BILL IS A BIT OF A REACH. WE DON'T THINK THAT CAL FIRE IS THE RESPONSIBLE ENTITY AND THE APPROPRIATE INTO. PREPARING A COMPREHENSIVE TERM WEST FOR EVERY UTILITY WHO HAS -- WE THINK THE UTILITIES HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE TO GO OUT INSPECT THEIR LINES MAKE SURE THEY'RE TRIMMING THE VEGETATION BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T AND THEY'RE NOT ACTING REASONABLY AND PRUDENTLY. RIGHT THERE. THEY BEAR SAID STAND FOR US SO WE THINK THERE IS UTILITY FOR A SCALED BACK FROM WEST HOW FIRES OUT EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE THE CORE MISSION FUNCTIONS. ASIDE FROM FIGHTING WILDFIRES ARE GOING TO BE DOING DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS AND HESITATION MANAGE. WHEN THEY'RE OUT IN -- THEIR TERRITORIES DOING INSPECTIONS DOING WORK THAT'S WHEN THEY CAN pTHAT'S AND CROUCHING. UPON UTILITY LINES LOG THOSE AND SUBMIT THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE CHILI KIND OF LIKE A MANDATED REPORTER SAYS YES WE THINK THAT WOULD PRESERVE THEIR SCARCE RESOURCES FOR THESE OTHER CORE FUNCTIONS. AND STILL ACCOMMODATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS -- TO ATTAIN THIS AUDIT FUNCTION WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE WORKER SAFETY PROVISIONS IN THE BILL -- ANY THE OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE BILL WE JUST ARE AFRAID THAT THIS WILL ROAD CAL FIRES RESOURCES AND FOCUSED ON THESE RESPONSIBILITY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE. OKAY -- WELL YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS -- IN THE NUMEROUS HEARINGS. AND WE ARE GIVING CAL FIRE MORE RESOURCES AND WE JUST TO PROVE A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL BUDGET -- FOR THE STATE'S READINESS STATEWIDE AND THE IDEA IS GONNA BE TWO IN ADDITION TO THAT EQUIPMENT TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE IN THIS BILL HAS A PROVISION. TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES SO I MEAN. ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE STATE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE. A CONSISTENT -- WE DON'T HAVE RESOURCES SPREAD OUT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE SOME AREAS THAT ARE. MUCH MORE PREPARED OTHERS ARE NOT AND WE WILL WE HAVE -- TO DO MORE. TO PROVIDE. CONSISTENT COVERAGE ACROSS THE STATE I THINK THIS BILL WILL DO AN ENORMOUS -- A GOOD IN ACCOMPLISHING NOT SO -- YOU. ARE ACCEPTING OR AMENDMENT BUT YOU'RE ALSO POSE IN ANOTHER AMENDMENT. IN ADDITION TO OURS ARTISTS AS TO REQUIRE THIS TO BE SEATED DETERMINE WHETHER. A TWO WAY BALANCING ACCOUNT IS NECESSARY. AND YOU ALSO WANTED INCLUDE IF THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATION EXCEEDED SOUTH RISE REVENUES FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SHALL IMMEDIATELY NOTICE. THE COMMISSION ON THE COMMISSION MAY. REQUIRE THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATION SEES VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK. DO YOU SEE I MEAN. YOU SEE AN AN I THINK THAT'S WE ARE YOU REASONABLE DO YOU THINK THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT I WILL BUT YOU THINK THIS AMENDMENTS EVEN NECESSARY JUST SEEMS IF IF. IF WHAT WAS. A LOT IT TO YOU FOR VIRGIN STATION MANAGEMENT. RUNS OUT. YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO GO BACK TO THE COMMISSION REQUESTS MORE REVENUES ORG LET THEM KNOW WE RAN OUT YET IS THAT RIGHT YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU WE WERE SUGGESTING THAT AS A A MORE PRACTICAL. WAY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THIS RACE IN THE ANALYSIS SO WHEN YOU HAVE A TWO WAY BOUNCING ACCOUNT. IF YOU DON'T SPEND ALL YOUR FUNDS THEN THEN YOU HAVE TO YOUR RECEIPT BACK TO TO THE TO THE COMMISSION. IF IF YOU. SEED YOUR FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED YOU CAN KEEP GOING BECAUSE IT'S NECESSARY WORK FOR FOR FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY PURPOSES -- WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS INSTEAD OF THE MOMENT IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS IS TO REQUIRE THAT THE UTILITY THE MOMENT THEY? USE UTILIZE ALL THEIR FUNDS THEY NOTICED NOTIFY THE COMMISSION. AND EXPLICITLY GIVE THE COMMISSION THE POWER TO SAY STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING UNTIL WE APPROVE MORE FUNDS BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS SLOW THEM DOWN AND HAVE THEM YOU KNOW PULL BACK TO CREWS THAT ARE DOING THIS CRITICAL WORK. BUT WE WE ALSO WELL. THAT'S WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY WE DON'T WANT TO STOP THE WORK. HAVE TO RESORT. TO A REGULATORY PROCESS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND REMEMBER THE UTILITY DOESN'T MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF THE FUNDS. STATION MANAGER MEANING THEY DON'T GET YOU KNOW A PERCENTAGE -- RETURN ON THAT AT ALL IT JUST IT'S DOLLAR IN GOES DOLLAR OUT TO THE WORK AT HAND -- WORK WITH YOU ON THAT WE JUST ONE ON ONE TO REVIEW AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT. ACCOMPLISHES WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- ANYONE ELSE. WILL MOVE BILL YOU NEED TO SAY SOMETHING. TO I THINK IT'S IT'S COMING IN MY COMMITTEE I'LL BE SUPPORTING TODAY BUT I JUST WANTED TO LAY A LITTLE BIT A GROUP GROUNDWORK. I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT IN THE NON TREAT. WE'RE THE WE'RE BIG TREES AREN'T THE ISSUE. I WANT TO I WANT TO KNOW MORE MAYBE THIS IS FOR THE UTILITY -- REPRESENTATIVE HERE BUT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS THIS WORK LOOK LIKE IN THE SOUTH LAND IN THE CHAPARRAL ANOTHER SHOULD NOT. WE'RE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SORT OF A DIFFERENT. PUZZLE THAN JUST ABOUT TO TREAT THE TRIM LIST. JUST CURIOUS OKAY SO -- SO THE THE THE REGULATION REQUIRES THE UTILITY TO CLEAR FOR TWELVE FEET AROUND THE LINE. BUT THEN THE RESOURCES CODE GOES ON TO SAY. IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU HAVE TO CLEAR ANY TREE. OR VEGETATION THAT COULD POTENTIALLY. BECAUSE A INCIDENT SO YOU -- SO THAT'S WHERE CAL FIRE COMES INTO EFFECT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE AS HE AS A WITH OUR CREWS GO OUT THEY GET INTO THIS VERY. A STICKY SITUATION THEY THERE'S THE THE THE TREES AND HE'D BE CLEAR CLEARLY WITHIN THE TWELVE FOOT RANGE BUT THEN THERE'S TREES ON A JOINING PRIVATE PROPERTY. THAT. UNDER THE RESOURCES CODE THE UTILITIES OBLIGATED TO GO AND CUT IF THEY THINK COULD POTENTIALLY IN IN IN IN IN IN THE EVENT. INTERSECT WITH THE LINES THAT'S A VERY SUBJECTIVE THING. PROPERTY OWNERS OF THEY DON'T TAKE TOO KINDLY TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ALL OF A SUDDEN GOING ON TO THEIR PROPERTY TO CUT A TREE. THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY DIRECTLY WITHIN THAT TWELVE FOOT RADIUS AND SO THAT'S A PROBLEM WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WE DEAL REALLY ANGRY. YEAH I HAVE -- TO SO YEAH AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO CLOSE IT HERE BUT LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THAT AND THAT I JUST WANT TO KNOW THE THE ON THE TWO WAY ACCOUNT THOUGH THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT -- THE WHAT'S THE PLAN THERE WHAT WHAT HOW ARE YOU PRECEDING HERE AND IT'S SORT OF WHAT'S THE MAN OKAY IF. WE DON'T WANT TO WORK. AND MY CONCERN WITH THE STOP AT THIS MOMENT. SO WE JUST WANNA LOOK AT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE IF IF IF THAT IS THE CASE IF THIS ACCOMPLISHES WHAT WE BOTH WANT. WILL ACCEPT THIS AMENDMENT. IN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE OTHER SO -- IF YOU WANT. TO MOTION WE GET A MOTION CLOSING WE ASK DR A COOK -- YEAH YEAH I'M SORRY GO AHEAD. THANK GOD I JUST HAD SOME CONCERNS SENATOR DODD -- THIS IS A A VERY -- SPECIFIC ORGANIZATION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF FIRE SAFETY. AND I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT MAYBE SOME MISSION CREEP FOR IT BEING EXPENSIVE INVENTORY TAKER FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT WE ALREADY -- PROVIDE FOR AND I'M. I'M I'M WONDERING IF TWO THINGS ONE IS WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE DURING THE INVENTORY AND MARY SEES BABY AT A SEVERE CONDITION. ARE THEY PERMITTED IN AT THAT TIME JUST TO TAKE CARE OF IT. OR OR DO THEY HAVE TO CALL IT IN SAY HEY SEND A CREW [inaudible] THE EXPERTS. UP WITH WELL CURRENTLY WHAT HAPPENS IS -- TO A CONTRACTOR USUALLY IT'S NOT EMPLOYEES OF PGD BUT I CONTRACT LIKE DAVEY TREES. WILL GO OUT AND DO A PRE CUT -- INVENTORY IN A PARTICULAR ZONE AND IDENTIFY ALL OF THE TREES IT NEED TO BE TRAINED AND AND MANAGE -- THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY IF THEY SEE SOMETHING THAT IS CREATE WOULD CREATE AN IMMINENT -- POTENTIAL FOR AN INCIDENT. TO FLAG THAT AND THEN -- YOU KNOW THE BIG THE COMPANY CAN MAKE THE DECISION TO SEND A CREW OUT IMMEDIATELY TO ADDRESS THAT IF THEY IF THEY DEEM IT AT THAT LEVEL THEY DO HAVE THAT AUTHORITY BUT TYPICALLY. THEY DO THE THE THE THE GRID FOR THE ZONE. THEN THE UTILITY WILL THEN HIRE ANOTHER CONTRACTOR TO GO OUT AND ACTUALLY CLEAR THOSE TREES AND THEN THE CONTRACTOR THE DID THE INSPECTION GOES BACK OUT AND INSPECTS AND SAYS YEAH. THE ADEQUATELY ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE INTENDED THEM TO DO MR WHICH JUST YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT. THAT THAT'S PROBABLY MY BIGGEST CONCERN YOU'VE ALREADY GOT. A CONTRACTOR COMING IN AND DOING THE INVENTORY AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING WE WANT CAL FIE TO DO THAT INVENTORY AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THAT'S A SMART MOVE WHEN WE'RE READY. WELL BECAUSE THERE THE FIRE EXPERTS. THEY HAVE GREATER EXPERTISE THEN A CONTRACTOR PERHAPS A CONTRACTOR WHO JUST COME TO CALIFORNIA FROM ARIZONA OR NEVADA. AND THERE THE FIRE EXPERTS THEY'RE THE ONES WE SEND IN POST FIRE TO DETERMINE. IF THE TREES WERE APPROPRIATELY -- TRIMMED AND MAINTAINED SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE AT LEAST TO TO US THAT THEY WOULD BE THE BEST SOURCE TO GO IN AHEAD OF TIME. FOR PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND IDENTIFY THE TREES THATTHEY BELIEVE WOULD CREATE THE BIGGEST RISK FOR THEM HAVING SAID THAT WOULD THAT CREATE A LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WELL IT DOESN'T SHIP IT DOESN'T SHIFT TO THE ALLIED ABILITY SENATOR BECAUSE UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION UTILITY. IS ON THE HOOK REGARDLESS IF -- IF A FIRE IS CREATED BY A PIECE OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE THERE THERE COULD BE SOME SOME NEW IT CONFERRED LIABILITY WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INDEMNIFY -- CAL FIRE IN THOSE INSTANCES -- SO THAT'S DEFINITELY A SOMETHING THAT IS IS BEING WORKED ON BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LIABILITY OF THE UTILITY BECAUSE OF INVERSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY A CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] CLOSING [inaudible] YES. ADD TO PASS TO BE AMENDED AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER WAS SO BY. WITH SO I MORE LOCK. EFFORT. BRADFORD I CHING. CHANG AYE DODD AYE DODD AYE HERTZBERG. HILL [inaudible] MCGUIRE [inaudible] RUBIO. pSKINNER AYE STERN AYE STERN AYE STONE STONE NO WIENER. WIENER AYE [inaudible] HERTZBERG AYE [inaudible] CENTER WHERE [inaudible] NINE NINE TO ONE WE'RE GONNA CALL THE ROLL OPEN PRESS MEMBERS. WHAT I'D LIKE TO TO SEE IF YOU COULD GIVE SOME BRIEF OPENING COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT YOUR BILL WOULD ACCOMPLISH AND THEN WORKING I WHAT WOULD LIKE TO GO DOWN THE AMENDMENTS OF THE LIST OF AMENDMENTS -- FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE PUBLIC AND THE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS KIND OF WHERE WE HAVE OUR OUR DISAGREEMENT. AND SEE HOW WE CAN WORK IT OUT -- AT A LATER DATE NOT ARE TODAY BUT THE IDEA IS TO COME TO A CONSENSUS. AND I THINK WE CAN WE'RE NOT FAR AWAY -- BUT IF YOU COULD JUST BEGIN SURE ABSOLUTELY MR IN THANK YOU AND ALL. MAKE BRIEF OPENING REMARKS AND THEN -- I HAVE A LIST OF THE AMENDMENTS AND WE LARGELY AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT I I AGREE WITH YOU WILL I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS FLEXIBILITY I WANT TO THANK THE OUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING VERY CLOSE WITH MY STAFF ON THIS. ISSUE -- SO OUR COLLEAGUES ON SB TWO EIGHTY A IS A BI PARTISAN CLEAN ENERGY BILL -- THAT I'M PROUD TO BE DOING AUTHORING WITH SENATOR NIELSEN. WHAT ONE THING WE SHOW OVER AND OVER AGAIN HERE IN THE CAPITAL IS UNLIKE OUR -- COUSINS -- IN WASHINGTON DC THAT ARE WE CAN WORK IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER. NOT EVERY ISSUE IS A PARTISAN ISSUE SO I WANT TO THANK US CENTER NIELSEN FOR PARTNERING WITH US IN THIS BILL -- THIS LEGISLATION WILL ENABLE -- HOUSEHOLDS ARE BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES TO INSTALL -- DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR AND STORAGE. IN ORDER TO SAVE MONEY REDUCE EMISSIONS -- AND RETAIN POWER IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY -- OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN -- TO OBTAIN THEIR POWER FROM ON SITE GENERATION AND STORAGE. OF A FAR MORE WILL BE NEEDED IF WE'RE TO MEET OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS AND ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AND WILDFIRES -- WILD BOAR DVRS A DISTRIBUTOR RESOURCES CAN SAVE CUSTOMERS -- BOTH BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MONEY. AND HELP KEEP THE LIGHTS ON THEIR ON GOING CHALLENGES THE PREVENT GREATER DEPLOYMENT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES. IN PARTICULAR -- SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT ADDRESSES THE ISSUES OF TO LEAD INTERCONNECTION -- SOMETIMES SEVERE DELAYS -- AN OUTDATED TERRACE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES ARE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH OTHER ALTERNATIVES. WHEN A SOLAR STORAGE SYSTEM IS INSTALLED THE LOCAL UTILITY OF COURSE HAS TO CONNECTED TO THE GRID? UNFORTUNATELY AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE AT THE COMMERCIAL LEVEL SO FOR BUSINESSES OR FOR SCHOOLS -- THESE INTERCONNECTIONS CAN BE DELAYED MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS COSTING THE CUSTOMER SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND WASTED TIME. SB -- TWO EIGHTY EIGHT DIRECTS THE CPUC AND PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES TO STREAMLINE THE INTERCONNECTION PROCESS -- THE BILL IS NOT TAKEN OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACH IT SIMPLY DIRECTS THE AGENCIES TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. A SIMILAR OUTDATED TERRACE CAN MEAN THAT DISTRIBUTOR RESOURCES ARE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING COMPARED TO OTHER SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY WITH REGARD TO COMPENSATION FOR PROVIDING THAT ENERGY INTO THE GRID. FOR EXAMPLE NO UTILITY IN THE STATE EITHER PUBLIC OR INVESTOR OWNED CURRENTLY HAS A TERROR FOR RAM TO COMPENSATE STANDALONE STORAGE IN OTHER WORDS STORAGE WITHOUT SOLAR. OFFERED FOR DISCHARGING TO THE GRID DURING TIMES OF PEAK LOAD. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY FIRING UP THE DIRTY A SPEAKER PLANS TO MEET DEMANDS. OF THESE PROTECT THE POTENTIAL THESE RESOURCES NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED. A DISTRIBUTOR RESOURCES BENEFIT ALL CUSTOMERS NOT JUST THE OWNERS. BY CLEANING THE AIR AND DURING THAT ENSURING THE JOB STATE LOCAL AND PROVIDING ELECTRICITY DURING EMERGENCIES. WELL IT TO THE LIST YES AS WELL AS REDUCING THE NEED FOR COSTLY UPGRADES -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND IN TERMS OF THE AMENDMENTS -- I HAVE A LIST OF IT'S ESSENTIALLY HE'D AMENDMENTS -- NUMBER -- ONE WHICHMAKES ODD SEVEN DIFFERENT CHANGES TO INTENT LANGUAGE INCLUDING STRIKING THE MENTION OF THE WORD. RIGHT FROM THE BILL WE'RE IN AGREEMENT ON THAT. A NUMBER -- TWO EXEMPTING FIFTEEN SMALL PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES WITH COMBINED -- CUSTOMERS HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS STRIKING UP IN THE BILL WE AGREE TO THAT. NUMBER THREE ARE REMOVING -- SEE YOU SEE OVERSIGHT OF P. O. U. INTERCONNECTION PROCESS -- AND CHANGING -- BIRTH RESPECT TO THE CDC REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON PO YOU INTERCONNECTION DELAYS FROM EVALUATING TO REPORTING -- WE ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT NUMBER FOR ADDING LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS UTILITIES TO PRIORITIZE CERTAIN INTERCONNECTION PROJECTS OVER OTHERS. WE AGREE TO THAT. NUMBER -- FIVE MAKE ARE MAKING STORAGE EXPORT TERROR OF DEVELOPMENT OPTIONAL AND ADDING IN GHG LANGUAGE. SO WE AGREED TO THAT. AND AND RETALIATION REPAIR LANGUAGE TO YES IN INDIA HERE. AND THEN. THERE'S THAT THOSE OF THE FIVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO AND THEN THE THE SIX THAT WE AGREE TO IS. STRIKING THE SECTION THAT DIRECTS THE CPC AND K. SO -- DIRECT THEM TO WORK TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO STORAGE WE AGREE TO THAT AMENDMENT. AND THEN THERE TO ADDITIONAL MEMBERS ONE OF THEM IS -- THE THE COST SHIFTING PROTECTION LANGUAGE ON ALL STORAGE TERRACE -- WE BELIEVE THAT WERE EXTREMELY CLOSE TO A RESOLUTION ON THAT -- AND I KNOW MY STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND WORKING TOGETHER ON REMAIN. ON THAT -- AND SO THAT WE'RE NOT A 100% OF THE WAY THERE YET BUT I'M I THINK WE'RE ALMOST THERE. AND THEN THE FINALLY THE ONE WHERE WE I THINK JUST WE NEED TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSIONS IS. ARE THE BILL -- PROHIBITS A DISCRIMINATORY INTERCONNECTION FEES. AND I THINK THERE'S JUST MORE DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD BETWEEN -- MY OFFICE AND THE COMMITTEE ON THAT ISSUE OR NOT SO WERE WERE NOT YET AN AGREEMENT ON THE COST OF PROTECTION BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GET THERE AND I THINK WE'RE CLOSE. AND THEN WE ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE DISCRIMINATORY FEET OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE DISCRIMINATORY FEES. PROVISION IN OUR BILL AND BUT WE COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH KAMALA VERY EVERYBODY BELIEVES SO SHOULD BE NO COST SHIPS AND EVERYBODY ARGUES THERE'S NO SCHOLARSHIPS AND NOW WE JUST WANT TO ESTABLISH THAT IN AND AND SATCHER. YEAH OKAY VERY WELL. AND SO -- AND WHAT ELSE I'VE I BELIEVE THAT WAS. AND THEN THERE ARE SOME TECHNICAL LANGUAGES THAT WERE MENTIONED AT LANGUAGE CONCERNING THE RECOGNITION OF THE ARTS TO PERFORM A CERTIFIED. STATE IN WHEN INSTALLED TWO O'CLOCK. LOOK WILL CODES OR DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY [inaudible] AND AND THE ONE THAT WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON IS THIS ONE RIGHT RIGHT HERE. THAT ONE IS THE THE TERRACE FOR ME -- FIFTY MM AND UNDER ON PAGES SEVEN IN A GROUP WITH REGARD TO CORTES COMMENTARY FEES -- IT'S UP TO THE TOP OF PAGE AIDS -- I'M AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO TRY TO REACH RESOLUTION ON THAT BY THIS POINT WE'RE NOT IN FULL AGREEMENT. AND IT CLARIFIES THE UTILITIES ABILITY CHARGE FEES THAT ARE JUSTIFIED. THE DISCRIMINATORY PIECE WE AGREE WITH THAT. THERE WERE STILL AT WORK ON THE HOUR OR SO WORKING ON THAT WERE NOT IN AGREEMENT YEAH. AND THE LANGUAGE REQUIRING TERRACE -- THAT ARE MODIFIED SHOULD INSTEAD. ASSESS WHETHER TO MODIFY THE EXISTING TERRACE. YEAH THAT'S OKAY OKAY. THIS ONE'S OKAY. TO OKAY VERY WELL -- SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF IT WE DO HAVE BOND -- TWO WITNESSES ARE TODAY -- TO GET AROUND TO WITNESSES TO MAKE COMMON YES BRIEF COMMENTS ARE GARY THE ARE -- OF EMPIRE AND NOT COMPANY. AND THEN DEVON OLIVER OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP OF CORPORATION OKAY. GO AHEAD. THE PHRASE. WE DON'T BY HEART.

FOR THE FOR THAT PURPOSE TO TRY TO GET. YOU KNOW AT LEAST DEFINITIVE ANSWERS AND WE'VE WE HAD WE KNOWN THIS PRIOR -- TO INITIATING THE PROJECT OF HOW LONG IT WAS GOING TO BE THE INTERCONNECTION CHALLENGES WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE THE PROJECT AND SO IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY DAMAGING TO US AND OTHERS LIKE US. SO WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH AND TWELVE MORE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S DEVIN OLIVER AND I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. THE PARTNERSHIP WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND LEADERSHIP ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE AND POLICY. AND ALSO THOSE WHO BUILD IT. THE PRO TEM OF THE SENATE AND THE SPEAKER APPOINT A BOARD AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR -- AND WIRED FOR A HOUSING ORGANIZATION SPEAKING WITH A AS A WITNESS SO WE BECAME INVOLVED IN CLEAN ENERGY POLICY AND PROGRAMS ALMOST A DECADE AGO AFTER WE REALIZED THAT LOW INCOME RENTERS ALSO HAVE A HUGE STAKE IN THIS POLICY AREA. IN A LOT OF WAYS CLEAN ENERGY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAME IN A POINT WITH OUR WORK. NOT BY HELPING LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACCESS AND BENEFIT FROM CLEAN ENERGY. THAT ACTUALLY HELPS US ACHIEVE OUR GOAL ONE OF OUR GOALS OF PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. LARGER SAVINGS ON TENANTS ENERGY BILLS AS WELL AS OWNERS OPERATING COSTS. SPECIFICALLY WORK WITH NONPROFIT PROPERTY OWNERS TO BRING THE BENEFITS OF SOLAR TO LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS MANY THROUGH TO KEEP PROGRAM SO IT'S THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM AND THEN THE SO SO OUR MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM THAT'S UPCOMING. SO AS ADVOCATES FOR ACQUITTAL ACCESS TO BOTH CLEAN ENERGY AND ALSO HOUSING WE SUPPORT TO A WITH THE PARTNERSHIP SUPPORT SB. TWO EIGHTY EIGHT AND THANKS THANKS TO STATE INVESTMENT IN SOLAR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN MULTI FAMILY FOR A HOUSING. MORE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN EVER IN THE STATE. CAN BENEFIT FROM OF TOUGH SOLAR FOR THEIR ENERGY NEEDS. REALLY QUICKLY DODD LOPEZ SERVE THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM SERVE. TWO THOUSAND FOUR NINETY FOUR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITH SO THE PEAVEY AND THE MACHIN SAYS PROGRAMS ALONE HAVE BROUGHT OVER EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PROJECTS. TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPERTIES. OF DESPITE THIS PROGRESS WE HAVE A LOT OF MORE WORK TO DO AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY. THE DISCRIMINATORY FEES OUTDATED TARIFFS AND ALSO THE RED TAPE CONTINUE TO THREATEN OUR PROGRESS IN EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO BENEFIT FROM CLEAN ENERGY. JUST LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE INCRIMINATORY FEES DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHO IRONICALLY STAND TO BENEFIT THE MOST FROM CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. AND SO SB TWO EIGHTY IT WOULD HELP PROTECT LOW INCOME REPAIRS I'M TAKING ON EVEN GREATER ENERGY BURDENS THAT DEFINITELY HIGH AND GETTING HIGHER.

GOOD MORNING GABOR LINE FOR US FROM CALL CALIFORNIA AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO TAKE US TO SB ONE HUNDRED CONCLUSION. AND I THINK THIS BILL TO EIGHTY EIGHT PROVIDES GUARD RAILS TO GET US THERE THANK YOU. VIRGIN AYE VOTE. MORNING MY NAME IS RANDY SOBRE. A MOTOR -- I SUPPORT THE SP. TWO EIGHTY EIGHT FOR MY INVESTMENT. AND DON'T LIKE TO SEE IT GO BACKWARDS IN BE ATTACKED SO. I'D LIKE. TO AND I VOTE PLEASE. CHRIS REYES ON BEHALF OF THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK. TO HAVE -- SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MIGHT. THROW MYSELF AT THE END OF THE LINE. I I'M I WAS AT THE TABLE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS NOT JUST. GIVE US YOUR NAME SUCH CONSTANTINE VOTE SOLAR REGULATORY DIRECTOR VOTE SOLAR AND WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORTER THIS BILL FOR MANY REASONS AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT IT IF NECESSARY. UP US BECAUSE IN OPPOSITION IF WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM APPEAR ON THE ON THE TABLE PLEASE. YEAH ONLY WITH THE BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE YEAH THANK YOU BEGINNING WITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK -- WERE HERE EIGHT TO OPPOSE SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT TODAY I'M WEDO SUPPORT THE INCREASED RELIANCE ON ENERGY STORAGE AND WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STATE'S RESOURCE PLANNING OBJECTIVES -- AND WE SUPPORT REMOVING UNFAIR BARRIERS TO TIMELY INTERCONNECTION. BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT TYING THE HANDS OF STATE REGULATORS TO FAIRLY ASSIGNED COSTS ACROSS ALL GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS. ON WE KNOW THAT SOME AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TODAY WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE AMENDMENTS IN PRINT. BEFORE WE CHANGE OUR POSITION -- BUT OUR CONCERNS ARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT IS CURRENTLY IN PRINT COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COST SHIFTING AND RAISE RATES FOR THE CUSTOMERS THAT DO NOT OWN OPERATE OR AT LEAST BEHIND THE METER DISTRIBUTED ENERGY. RESOURCES. THESE CAUTIOUS ARE NOT JUSTIFIED THERE UNNECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AND STORAGE SYSTEMS AND THEY WOULD INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY BURDEN FOR MANY LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE STATE. IN PARTICULAR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS RELATING TO ONSITE GENERATION AND STORAGE MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT CANNOT BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD AT THIS TIME. IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS COULD HAMPER THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE TERRORISTS. IN RULES THAT ATTEMPT TO BALANCE THE INTERESTS OF VARIOUS CUSTOMER GROUPS ENSURE GREAT RELIABILITY AND FAIRLY APPORTIONED SYSTEM COSTS. CUSTOMERS THAT DON'T HAVE STORAGE SYSTEMS DON'T HAVE SIMILAR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT PROTECT THEM AGAINST COST SHIFTING. AND THAT'S A MAJOR OMISSION SO IF THIS PROVISION RELATING TO RIGHTS IS REMOVED FROM THE BILL THAT WOULD ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR CONCERN. WE ALSO STRONGLY OBJECT TO THE DEPRIVATION THAT WOULD RIGIDLY CONSTRAIN THE AUTHORITY OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO DESIGN SENSIBLE TERRACE THAT BOUNCE THE COSTS AND BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THESE RESOURCES. THE BILL AS DRAFTED NOW WOULD PREVENT THE COMMISSION FROM ASSIGNING ANY COST RESPONSIBILITY TO A CUSTOMER FOR PRODUCTION CM ENERGY RESOURCE THAT IS CONSUMED ON SITE. THIS IS KIND OF A RED FLAG BECAUSE THE P. C. HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THE DESIGN OF THESE TERRORISTS AS PART OF ITS NET ENERGY METERING PROCESS. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMISSION WILL BE LOOKING AT THE THIRD REVISION OF THE NET ENERGY METERING RULES SOMETIME LATER THIS YEAR THIS BILL COULD HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THOSE RULES. I'M UNLESS OF CUSTOMER IS PHYSICALLY DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRIC GRID IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO CATEGORICALLY PROHIBIT ANY COSTS FROM BEING CHARGED TO THEM FOR A GENERATION THAT IS NOT EXPORTED. LOOK THERE A LOT OF COST COMING DOWN RIGHT NOW WHEN UTILITY RATES THIS THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD ABOUT PLENTY OF THEM -- THERE'D BEEN BILLS APPROVED TO AUTHORIZE SPENDING ON ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ON TREE TRIMMING WE HEARD TODAY. CERTAINLY WILDFIRE LIABILITIES A BIG ONE EVERY CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE TO BE EXEMPT FROM HAVING TO PAY THEIR SHARE OF THESE COSTS -- BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT ISSUING SUCH EXEMPTIONS I'M WHETHER YOU INSTALL A STORAGE SYSTEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR WILDFIRE LIABILITY -- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILLS THAT GO THROUGH HERE. DON'T CARVE UP THE CUSTOMER BASE TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE ONLY SOME CUSTOMERS WHO REMAIN TO PAY THE BILL AND FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE LANGUAGE PROTECTING AGAINST COST SHIFTING WE ARE EAGERLY LOOKING TO SEE THE LANGUAGE AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH SENATOR WINNERS OFFICE ON THIS. BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- SIMILAR LANGUAGE IN STATE LAW WAS PRETTY MUCH IGNORED BY THE P. YOU SEE IN ITS DSIGN OF THE NET METERING SUCCESSOR TARIFF. WHERE IT'S SIMPLY CONCLUDED THAT IT COULDN'T DETERMINE WHETHER COST SHIFTING WAS OCCURRING EVEN THOUGH THE MODEL THAT IT WAS RELYING ON FOUND THAT EVERY SINGLE PROPOSAL IN THE CASE INCLUDING THE ONE THAT THEY ADOPTED? PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL COST SHIFTING THANK YOU. ROGER ROGER THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES SOCI ATION REPRESENTING OVER SIXTY PUBLICLY OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND WATER AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE AS HE HAS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION IN OUR MEMBERS ARE. AND NATIONAL LEADERS -- ON IMPLEMENTING ENERGY PROGRAMS THAT ARE SAFE AFFORDABLE RELIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AND WE RECOGNIZE THE ROLE OF DISTRIBUTED GENERATION. AND EVERY YEAR OUR MEMBERS. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE EFFICIENTLY APPROVED THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMER INTERCONNECTION REQUESTS AND INNER FOCUSED ON ENSURING DG IS APPROPRIATELY INTEGRATED TO THE LECTERN GRAD. WE APPRECIATE THE THRONE ALICE'S -- DONE BY THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND UNDERSTAND THAT A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TODAY THAT -- WE LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND I THINK THE ADDRESS A NUMBER OF HER CONCERNS IN PARTICULAR WE'D APPRECIATE. THE DISCUSSION ABOUT REMOVING CC OVERSIGHT OF PUBLIC AND ELECTRIC UTILITIES AS THEIR LOCALLY GOVERNED -- ELECTRIC UTILITIES. I'M WERE WELL I'M A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR ON EXACTLY WHAT. USE HAVE BEEN EXEMPT FROM THE BILL LAST NIGHT WE ARE TOLD TO BE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND UNDER CUSTOMERS IN TODAY I'M HERE A DIFFERENT NUMBER SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THAT AMENDMENT AS WELL. AND THE REMAINING ISSUES ARE REALLY THE TARIFF -- FOR STORAGE ONLY AND THE COST SHIFT ISSUE I'M SEE MAYES MEMBERS OR ARE MUST MEET A HOST OF STATUTORY DIRECTIVES INCLUDING WHILE FIRE MITIGATION MEETING OUR PS MAINTAINING THEIR ELECTRIC GRID TO CERTAIN STANDARDS AND THAT THAT. THAT DRIVES THE COSTS AND THE RATES -- SO WE ONE OF OUR MEMBERS HAD SUBMITTED LANGUAGE THAT AUTHORS OFFICE INTO THE COMMITTEE THAT WE THINK WOULD RESOLVE THE COST SHIFT APPROPRIATELY. AND WOULD ENSURE THAT FEES. THAT UTILITIES CAN CHARGE FEES AND TO ENSURE THAT THEIR REVENUE OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT. CHANGED OR HINDERED BY -- THEY CONTINUED INTERCONNECTION OF DISTRIBUTED GENERATION SO MOVING FORWARD IN CLOSING. IF THE BILL MOVES OUT TODAY WITH FORD COMMUTING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS -- TO BALANCE THE NEED FOR PEER USED TO MEET THEIR STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE SAFE AFFORDABLE POWER WITHOUT UNFAIRLY SHIFTING COSTS TO OTHER CUSTOMERS THANK YOU. GOOD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON JAZZ MONEY JONES WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS. ASSOCIATION -- WE REPRESENT WHOLESALE -- RENEWABLE RESOURCES AS WELL AS STORAGE MY MEMBERS HAVE DEPLOYED -- SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF RENEWABLE IN THE STATUS IS COMMITTEES WELL AWARE -- AND WE'VE ALSO DEPLOYED -- STORAGE -- WHERE IN FACT IT IT WORKS? WE ARE PROUD OF THAT IS LOW COST RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS WHERE THEY OWN A HOME OR NOT -- AND WHETHER THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL -- TO BUY EQUIPMENT -- OR OR NOT -- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO TO SUPPORT THAT -- I PERSONALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN PROMOTING SOLAR ENERGY SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SO I DON'T NEED TO BE CONVINCED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF IT -- IN MEDIAN -- ALL OF OUR GOALS HOWEVER -- WE'VE OPPOSE THIS BILL PRIMARILY A SECTION -- FOR OF THE BILL -- WHICH BASICALLY SHIFTS THINGS SIGNIFICANTLY CUSTOMER CITED -- GENERATION IS STORED SHOULD BE USED FOR CUSTOMER PURPOSES AT THE CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS PROGRAMS THAT THAT DO THAT WITH THIS BILL BASICALLY -- IS SUGGESTING IS THAT WE MOVE FROM THAT TO BASICALLY AGGREGATING OR INDIVIDUALLY HAVING CUSTOMERS NOW INTERACT WITH THE WHOLESALE MARKET WHICH IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT -- MARKET -- AND SOMETHING TO GETS COMPLICATED VERY VERY QUICKLY -- AS I THINK MISTER -- YOU KNOW IT IT WITHIN THE CUSTOMER SIDE A GUY CONTEXT PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF THAT ROUTE THAT RESOURCE TO THE EXTENT THERE'S ACCESS SOLAR ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE NUMBER ROGER EXT. THEY GET THE ENERGY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO BE THINKING ABOUT THIS -- MOVING FORWARD -- THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION -- AS WELL AS YOU GUYS SO I THINK AS MR FRIEDMAN -- AS INDICATED ON I'M NOT GOING TO REITERATE WHAT HE SAID -- BUT ARE BE ARE BASICALLY ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS TRYING TO DEAL WITH. TECH WHAT SO ARE SOME OF THE REL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IN TERMS OF HOW YOU ACTUALLY -- YOU KNOW HOW YOU IN A CONNECTION OF ALL OF THAT STUFF IS IN PLAY BOTH AT AT THE AT THIS -- PP YOU SEE AND THE CAL I SO THE AGGREGATORS WHO YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM TODAY WHO ARE COMMERCIALLY TRYING TO AGGREGATE ALL THE SEXES GENERATION ARE VERY ACTIVE IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS. AND THAT'S FINE -- BUT YOU DOES IT AGAIN STANDALONE STORAGE IS A GOOD IDEA IN A FINISH UP IN A SECOND HERE -- BUT IT BUT AGAIN -- THE IT IS SUBJECT TO THESE OTHER PROCEEDINGS ONE LAST NOTE. AND I'M SPEAKING AS A RATE PAYER I MISS MY CUSTOMER AND I HAPPILY SIGNED OFF ON MY NEIGHBORS ROOFTOP SOLAR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA. I DON'T BECAUSE I THINK SMOG IS A GREAT JOB THAT THE YOU KNOW SINUS CLEAN ELECTRICITY BUT THEY DID. HOWEVER I DID NOT SIGN UP TO BASICALLY PAY FOR THE COSTS THAT THERE ARE BAD EATING -- BUT BY DRIFTING OFF THE SYSTEM AND SO I'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT DISCRIMINATED FEES THAT IS NOT THE POLICY OF **** IT'S BASICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S LEFT HOLE. AND SO I THINK THAT'S I THINK WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MISTER WE WENT TO A SPEAKING ON THE BEHALF OF THE I. O. U. CUSTOMERS JUST SPEAKING AS ONCE MY CUSTOMER AND I'M SURE TO MANY OF US THAT. SHARE THAT MY NEIGHBORS ARE YEAH I'M HAPPY TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT IN TERMS OF SIGNING OFF ON THE SEE SEE AN ARTISTIC INPUT SELLER ON THE ROUGH. BUT I DON'T FOOT THE BILL. JOHN THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. CHAIRMAN THERE'S REBEKAH LEE ON BEHALF OF A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND I'LL BE BRIEF HERE I THREE SPECIFIC POINTS CALIFORNIA'S HAS HAD AN ALPHABET SOUP OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT. THE OUR GROSS LEADING TO THE VERY SUCCESSFUL DRAMATIC GROWTH AND D. R. ADOPTION IN OUR SERVICE AREA WE HAVE INTERCONNECTED OVER. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS TO THESE TECHNOLOGY TYPES OVER. TWENTY THREE HUNDRED MAKE A WHAT AND THE QUESTION THAT WE SPEAK OF IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BENEFIT THESE CUSTOMERS PROVIDE IN OUR COST TO SURF THEM. RIGHT NOW THAT AT THE WE ESTIMATE THAT COST TO BE HAVE EVEN EXCEEDED. THE SUPPORT WE PROVIDE OUR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ON CARE RATES -- WHICH IS NOW USED TO SERVE ONE POINT TWO MILLION CUSTOMERS MY SECOND POINT IS THAT. WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF THE INTERCONNECTION PROCESS WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. IN. CONNECTING THESE CUSTOMERS WITH A STREAMLINED APPROACH HOWEVER IF THE INTERCONNECTION PROCESS IS SPECIFICALLY TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THE DISTRIBUTION GRAY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE NON PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS AND THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN TODAY'S AGE. IT IF WE ARE TO MAKE SAFETY OUR PRIORITY MY THIRD POINT IS THAT. WE HEARD TODAY ON EQUAL RULES WITH REGARDS TO OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS LIKE THE COMMUNITY CHOICE ACT READERS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AYE BREEDERS ARE SUBJECT TO COMPARABLE AND EQUAL RULES THAT WE HAVE -- HERE TOO THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR TURN NUMBERS ISRAEL SALAS WITH SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC I THINK -- I WE AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISTER FREEDMAN ON THE P. YOU SEE IGNORE IN SOME OF THE EXISTING LAWS ON THE NO COST SHIFTING. ALSO WE WE EAGERLY AWAIT THE THE ARRIVAL OF THE AMENDMENTS TO SEE HOW WHAT THE WORDS LOOK LIKE BECAUSE THE WORDS REALLY DO MATTER JUST TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT KASHIF LOOKS LIKE FOR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS TODAY. IT'S AN ANNUAL FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR COST SHIFT BY COMPARISON THE CARE PROGRAM WHICH SUPPORTS OUR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION SO IT'S ALMOST FOUR TIMES. WHAT WE'RE PAYING TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ON THE INTERCONNECTION PEAS LAST YEAR WE INTERCONNECT? NAM CUSTOMER THAN AN AVERAGE OF TWO AND HALF DAYS SO IF THERE ARE ISSUES OUT THERE WE ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM -- AND JUST TO ADD TO HIGHLIGHT THAT PIECE FURTHER WE WERE IN SEPTEMBER WERE GOING TO COMPLETE A SIX POINT FOUR MEGAWATT MICHAEL GOOD PROJECT WITH THE MORE MORE AIR BASE -- IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY THEY HAVE ASKED US -- TO PUT TOGETHER A CASE STUDY TO JUST ILLUSTRATE HOW WELL THAT INTERCONNECTION PROCESS HAS GONE SO WE GLADLY WELCOME OUR CUSTOMERS TO COME WORK WITH US ON HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT PROCESS BETTER. BUT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS IN THAT SPACE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO VIENNA FLEMING'S ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- WE DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED AND BE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WE BELIEVE THEY ADDRESS MANY OF OUR CONCERNS HOWEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE COST SHIFT LANGUAGE AND THE DISCRIMINATORY. FEES WE ARE STRONGLY ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE RAISED BY MISTER FRIEDMAN AT TURN -- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO SS OBJECT BEES THAT ARE JUSTIFIED -- WHEN NECESSARY AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT -- IN P. GENIES TERRITORY ALONE IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE KASHIF WORD NAM NAM FOR NAM CUSTOMER NAM NON PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS WAS APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. SO -- WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS -- THE LANGUAGE AROUND THE COST SHIFTING AND THE DISCRIMINATORY LANGUAGE AND WE THANK YOU. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DELYLAH CLAY ON BEHALF OF THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME HAVE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC FORTY WE'RE HERE WITH AND POSE LESS AMENDED POSITION WE DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THE BILL APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS. AND LOOKING FOR TECH CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ON THIS THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS GREG COOK REPRESENT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER THOR'S AGENCY. AND LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF US CMU WAY AND CAN LOOK FORWARD TO CONTAIN TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR DOT. AND THEN SENATOR BRETT SIR BRADFORD. Q. -- AND I'M GONNA THINK CENTER WIENER I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES AS IT RELATES. TO ENTER CONNECTING BUT MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS ONE THAT WE'VE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN. AND THE ISSUE OF COST SHIFT. AND TO CONTINUE TO ACT AS IF. LOW INCOME FOLKS BENEFIT FROM THIS WHEN THEY PAY THE BURDEN OF THE LAW WITH THE NON SOLAR CUSTOMERS PAY FOR THIS ROGRAM -- EXERT TELL ME HOW ONE BENEFITS FROM THE EXCESS POWER THAT'S LEFT OUT ON THE GRID FROM OVER GENERATION FROM SOLAR BECAUSE IN A MODERN. FLEXIBLE RENEWABLE CLEAN GREAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A VARIETY OF RESOURCES OUT THERE FROM UTILITY SCALE -- TO COMMUNITY SCALE TO INDIVIDUAL SCALE ALL OF THOSE RESOURCES NEED TO WORK TOGETHER THE EXCESS ENERGY HOW DO YOU HOW DOES HOW DOES A CUSTOMER BENEFIT FROM THE ACCESS. ELECTRON THAT'S PUT ON THE WATER. I AM THERE'S NO BENEFIT BECAUSE THE GREAT IS NOT BI DIRECTIONAL SO. WHETHER TO PUBLIC ON UTILITY OR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY THEY STEAL HAVE PURCHASE FOR THAT CUSTOMER SO TO CONTINUE TO PAY. A SOLAR CUSTOMER A RETAIL RATE FOR A WHOLESALE COMMODITY THAT'S TOTALLY USELESS IS NO WAY TO KNOW IN ADVANCE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A ACTUALLY ELECTRONS ON THE WIRE SO THAT'S THE STRANDED ASSET OUT THERE. THAT NO ONE BENEFITS FROM. SENATE RIGHT THE REAL ISSUE WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH IS TO DELAY AN INTERCONNECTION BUT TO SIT HERE AND SAY THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT FROM A NEW HELP. FOR NON SOLAR CUSTOMERS FROM A NEON PROGRAM I THINK IT'S THE BIGGEST WASTE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE REPAIR DOLLARS RIGHT TO TODAY. AND AGAIN FOR US TO SPEND MORE MONEY REIMBURSING. SOLAR CUSTOMERS NOW WE DO FOR CARE CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE IS A CRIME. SENATOR FIRST I I DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE THT THERE IS NO BENEFIT TO TO THOSE CUSTOMERS BUT EVEN AS IT APPLIED DIRECTIONAL GREG. THE ELECTION IS IT A BI DIRECTIONAL ABSOLUTELY ON A CERTAIN LEVEL THOSE ELECTRONIC LIKE WELL OUT OF THE HOW YOU DOING. ANYTIME THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A EXTRA ELECTRONS ON THE GRID SO THEY STILL HAVE THE BY FOR THAT CUSTOMER DOWNSTREAM. IS THIS A QUOTE. IS CENTER WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE IF MY WITH AS GOOD AS YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION RIGHT WHAT I IT'S NOT A BY DIRECT RICH AND HE DOES NO NO OKAY SO. IT WAS A STATEMENT NOT A QUESTION [inaudible] IT'S OKAY A CENTER DOT. YEP SAID THE CENTER RIGHT I TALKED TO BEFORE I'M GONNA FOLLOW THE CHAIRS. LEAD TODAY OUT ON THIS ISSUE BUT THIS -- THIS ISSUE WITH REGARD TO THE CCA'S VERY TROUBLING TO ME AND I WASN'T HERE FOR THAT. YEAH THE OPPOSITION -- THE CONVERSATION BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT -- WE NEED TO TREAT EVERYBODY FAIRLY I HEARD I HEARD YOU BEFORE I LEFT THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE WORKING -- WHAT BY JUST? YEAH WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I RESERVE THE RIGHT ALL AS WELL. TO CHANGE ON FOR CENTER I APPRECIATE THAT I DID GO BACK AND TO MY NOTES TO REMIND MYSELF THIS IS A ISSUE SO WE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE BUT IN GENERAL EVEN IF YOUR CCA COUNTRY. COUNTRY SEE SEE A CUSTOMER -- YOU IN THE INTERCONNECTION ISSUES AND THE ISSUES THAT WERE TALK ABOUT THIS BILL STILL TYPICALLY RUN THROUGH THE IRISH YOU. YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR INTERCONNECTION THROUGH YOUR CCA IT'S STILL. THROUGH THE I OWE YOU FOR THE MOST PART SO THE VISIT OUR SITE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THE CCA'S ARE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THESE INTERCONNECTION ISSUES WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO MORE DEEPLY AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROBLEM WE OP ABSOLUTELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PART OF THE SOLUTION AS WELL. WE DON'T THINK OF THE CCA'S ARE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THESE ACTIVITIES FOR THE MOST PART WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO MORE DEEPLY AND WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT WHAT THINK FURTHER BECAUSE I KNOW THAT -- CCA'S WANNA DO MICHAEL GRADS IN THOSE TYPE OF THING SO I THINK AT SOME POINT IN TIME. I MEAN IT'S IT'S ONLY GONNA BE A MATTER TIME WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO BE. YEAH YOU WE WILL BE AN ISSUE IT SEEMS TO ME. WE WILL LIKE TO RUN A LOT MORE DEEPLY INTO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WERE COVERED. CINEMARK THANK YOU. WHICH CHURCH JUST LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL -- TO WORK WORK WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL UNDERSTAND TRANSIT ADAPT AND WE WILL GET TO BE A LITTLE MORE PROACTIVE THAN REACTIVE AND AYE AYE AYE A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE FRUSTRATED WATCHING THE WATER. UTILITIES WHERE THEY HAVE SAID TO US WE NEED TO CONSERVE BECAUSE RUN A DROUGHT. AND SO WE WE REDUCED OUR USAGE OF WATER AND THEN THEY REALIZE THEIR REVENUES. WHEN? IT'S ALL OF A SUDDEN THE RATES WENT UP. AND SO WE WERE PENALIZED FOR DOING WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND I'M -- IT ARE A LITTLE UPSET WITH THE WITH THE DYSFUNCTIONAL ISM OF WHAT GOVERNMENT AND UTILITIES ARE DOING [inaudible] TWO CUSTOMERS AND SO I I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF BRING THAT. OUT THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE MODEL IT'S AN ANTIQUATED MODEL WE ARE. WE ARE. PENALIZING PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE RIGHT. THINGS THAT WE'VE WE'VE ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO IN. SEOUL THERE ARE TRENDS. WE GOT TO PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE AREN'T WEARING WATCHES ANYMORE. THE SMART PEOPLE ARE NOT WEARING WATCHES ANYMORE. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL USING THEIR THEIR CELLPHONES IN THE END AND IN NEWSPAPERS ARE DECLINING AND SO WE'VE GOT TO START LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE TRENDS AS WE GOVERN. AND PAY ATTENTION SO I'M I'M SORRY THAT WERE ALWAYS REACTING. AND CREATING THESE MASSIVE. DEBATES BUT WE'VE GOT TO START LOOKING AT THE THIRTY THOUSAND TITLE MORE AYE. THAT'S MORE IT'S MORE OF A STATEMENT WAS CENTER WIENER THAN A THAN A QUESTION OKAY THEN WILL COME TO CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PROUD WATCH WHERE THEY LIKE TO THINK THAT I LIKE TO THINK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING. CLOSELY WITH A SENATOR WIENER AND ONE THING I HAVE. I'VE LEARNED WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT HE'S A MAN OF HIS WORD AND I KNOW HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE. TO TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES ESPECIALLY OF CARSHARING AND CCA'S AND AND I APPRECIATE TO WORK WITH THEM ALL THE AMENDMENTS. BROUGHT FORWARD AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE -- TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU. ONE OF THE QUESTION I DO HAVE A QUESTION. I'M SENATOR WHEN ARE YOU OPPOSED TO CHANGING THE THEIR REIMBURSEMENT ON THE ON BECAUSE DO YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE THAT. FOR THE CHILI TO PAY A RETAIL RATE FOR ALSO COMMODITY. THAT'S WHAT IT NAM CUSTOMERS REACH OUR OUR REFUNDED AT A RETAIL RATE VERSUS A WHOLESALE COMMODITIES THE I. AGAIN AND ASK MR CONSTANTINE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- BECAUSE IT. KEEPS COMING UP IN TERMS OF THE ALLEGED CAUTION SO. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CURTAIL. THE ABILITY OF THE P. YOU SEE THE REGULATORS THE BOARDS OF GOVERNORS THE PIER USE TO CHANGE THE RATE FOR EXPORTS. IN FACT IT SPECIFICALLY ENCOURAGES AND CREATE THE SPACE FOR THE UTILITIES TO DO JUST THAT IT. GIVES DIRECTION TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS ABILITY TO CONSERVE ENERGY TO DO THE RIGHT THING ON THEIR PREMISES WITH THEIR ENERGY AND IT ALLOWS THE REGULATOR. IN EITHER THE PO YOU ARE THE I. YOU CASE. TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE EXPORTED ELECTRICITY IN THIS DOES THIS DOES NOTHING TO SET IN STONE THE CURRENT FULLY BUNDLED RETAIL NAM RATE IN FACT IT EXPRESSLY DOES NOT DO THAT. SO IT LEAVING THE AUTHORITY WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE WHAT IT IS DOING IS ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE TO SPEAK EXACTLY TO WHAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO TO CONSERVE ENERGY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DOLLARS TO PROVIDE A RESOURCE THAT CAN PROVIDE VALUE TO ALL RATEPAYERS ON THE GRID THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING WE ARE ASKING CUT CUSTOMERS. BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN SOLAR AND STORAGE WE NEED TO CREATE THE MECHANISMS TO ALLOW THAT VALUE TO FLOURISH AND SPREAD WE NEED TO STOP CURTAILING THEIR ABILITY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND IN FACT WE DON'T DO THAT TO PUT CUSTOMERS IN VERY SIMILAR SITUATIONS WHEN YOU PUT A HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER IN YOUR HOME AND YOU HAVE THAT TIED TO THE RATE THAT YOU PAY THE TIME OF USE RATES. WHICH WE HAVE DESIGNED. TO ALIGN YOUR USAGE WITH THE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE GRIP YOU ARE USING STORAGE. WHEN YOU PUT AN EFFICIENT WINDOWS YOU ARE REDUCING YOUR DEMAND ON THE UTILITY WE DO NOT REACH INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES AND PENALIZE THEM FOR THE? ENERGY THAT THEY DID NOT USE AND THAT IS THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THIS BILL IT SAYS WE SHOULD NOT IMPOSE DISCRIMINATORY FEES OR ARBITRARY ACCESS FEES ON SOLAR CUSTOMERS. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE ACCORDING TO PUBLIC POLICY IT LEAVES UNTIE REALLY OPEN AN ENTIRELY. A WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES FOR HOW TO ADDRESS COST SHIFT SO THIS ISSUE OF CAUTION I'M I'M VERY PLEASED THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO ADDRESS IT BUT THE FACT IS THAT THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO CURTAIL OUR ABILITY. TO LIMIT COST SHIFT AND IN FACT PROVIDE THE BENEFIT TO ALL RIGHT THANK OU AND WE'RE JUST GONNA CLOSEST NOW AND GO TO THE CLOSING COMMENTS BUT WELL THIS BILL DOES -- DOES PROTECT THE SOLAR CUSTOMERS SAYS WE DO NOT WANT TO DISCRIMINATORY VISA DOES NOT PROTECT THE NON. SOLAR CUSTOMERS SAY WE DO NOT DISCRIMINATORY FEES AGAINST THEM SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE. THAT'S THE ESSENCE AND IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ONE CUSTOMER WE SHOULDN'T DISCRIMINATE. AGAINST ANY THAT IS KIND OF THE DEBATE THAT WERE. TRYING TO SETTLE HERE AND WITH THE OUTCOME OF THIS BILL WE I WANT ALL REPAIRS TO BE. PROTECTED IN NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST. WILL ALLOW YOU TO MAKE YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS STRUCTURE I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION I USE A LITTLE HUMOR ON WATCH WHERE SAID I WAS NOT TRYING TO OFFEND ANYONE. BUT HAPPY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WE SEE THAT BUT BUT THE DATA SHOWS THE SYSTEMIC TRAIN IS THAT MILLENNIALS ARE NOT. BUYING HERE YOU COME AGAIN I SURE WINNER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN. AROUND AGAIN THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- FOR THIS THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION AS WE COULD SEE FROM DISCUSSION THE COMMITTEE -- AS WELL AS THE ROBUST -- PUBLIC COMMENT ON BOTH SIDES -- OBVIOUSLY THIS THIS ISSUE MATTERS AND IT MATTERS BECAUSE AS CENTER MORE LOCK POINTED OUT. WE'RE IN A PERIOD OF TRANSITION AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND WE DON'T WANT TO PENALIZE PEOPLE -- BUT THE REALITY IS. THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND WE NEED MORE CLEAN ENERGY AND RIGHT NOW IT IS TOO HARD FOR PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES AND SCHOOLS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PEOPLE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING WE SHOULD NOT BE PUTTING BARRIERS IN THEIR WAY. AND YES IT IS THE THE TREND THESE TRANSITIONS ARE NEVER. EASY. WE HAVE A CENTRALIZED MONOPOLY UTILITY MODEL IN CALIFORNIA. WITH AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT THE WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE OF THAT AND THERE ARE BENEFITS THEY'RE ALSO DOCUMENTS AND WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS. IN WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE WITH ENTIRE COMMUNITIES BURNING DOUBT -- AND HAVING. MORE ABILITY TO HAVE DECENTRALIZED ENERGY GENERATION HELP OF MANY DIFFERENT -- IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS INCLUDING RESILIENCY AND INCLUDING NOT HAVING TO BUILD AS MANY TRANSMISSION PROJECTS WHICH IS DIRECTLY INCREASES RATES FOR RATE PAYERS WHEN YOU HAVE. TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF THOSE PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. ALRIGHT SO THIS IS A TRANSITION. PROTECT PEOPLE WORKING TO DO THAT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY -- WE HAVE A MOTION. I CENTER STONE. CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. D. PASSES AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WEST SO HI WITH SO I MORE LOT. MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD. CHIANG DIED. DIED AYE HERTZBERG HILL MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER ALL RIGHT SKINNER AYE STERN STONE STONE AYE WIENER. WIENER AYE. IT WILL HOLD A ROOM FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR. ARE WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM CENTER MORE WORK [inaudible] THIS IS. NOT THE NOT THESE. TEN MINUTES TOPS [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] THIRTY OKAY. I NEED TO RUN A COUPLE RENTS NOMINAL [inaudible] QUESTIONS [inaudible] SENATOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING. TO REDUCE FUTURE WILDFIRES -- FROM OCCURRING ESPECIALLY WILDFIRES INSTIGATED BY SPARKING ELECTRIC LINES. COLLEAGUES THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ALREADY HAVE SPECIAL FUNDS. FOR DRESSING OVERHEAD POWER LINES. FOR PURPOSES OF UNIFICATION KNOWN AS REAL TWENTY A AND ALSO BE AND SEE. THE GOAL OF SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR IS TO BETTER UTILIZE THESE FUNDS FOR THE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK HERE. THREE TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF PEOPLE ON PEOPLE AND PROPERTY FROM CHILE ASSOCIATED WILDFIRES. SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR WOULD PROVIDE FOR MATCHING FUND OPPORTUNITIES ALLOWING I USED TO PARTNER WITH WILLING COMMUNITIES. FOR CONVERSION PROGRAM TO UNDERGROUNDCERTAIN ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. FUNDING WOULD ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE FROM THE G. G. R. AFTER GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. MISTER CHAIR THE COMMITTEE HAS REQUESTED I CONSIDER A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE AND COUNSEL ON THIS BILL. LET ME ADDRESS EACH RECOMMENDATION IN THE ORDER GIVEN IN THE STAFF REPORT. REGARDING G. G. R. F. APPROPRIATIONS OF A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT I ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT. TIER -- THREE THIS SURVEY KICK THEIR PATIENTS FIND. THREE REALLOCATION PROTOCOLS ARE ALSO ACCEPTABLE. THERE WERE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO SECTION ONE OF SECTION SEVEN ONE EIGHT TEN THE COMMITTEES CONSULTANTS. IS A FIERCE BUT FAIR NEGOTIATOR. SO I WILL ALSO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS TO BE TAKEN UP IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. MISTER CHAIR WITH A WILLING COMMUNITY SOME MODIFIED PROVISIONS MAY HAVE. COMMUNICATED THE WRONG CONCERNS ON WHAT HAS BECOME A LIFE OR DEATH MATTER SO CONSEQUENTLY I APPRECIATE ALL THE GIVE AND TAKE THAT. HAS BEEN PROVIDED ON ASSISTING US ON THIS BILL. SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR PROVIDES A PROFESSIONAL FRAMEWORK OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE CLIENT COMMUNITY AN ELECTRIC UTILITY PROVIDER. IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE. UTILITIES WHO LEARNED HARD LESSONS TWO DECADES AGO THEY HAVE BEEN HARDENING ASSETS METHODICALLY OVER THE PAST TWENTY PLUS YEARS. SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR CONTINUES THE SEPARATE WITH A METHOD TO EXPEDITE SMART TRANSMISSION OF POWER IN THE SAFEST COLLABORATIVE MANNER. AND I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. COUNCILMAN BOB WILL IN LAGUNA BEACH AND FORMER MAYOR RICK MULLIN FROM. MALIBU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

WE'RE SURROUNDED BY SIXTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF OPEN SPACE 85% OF OUR COMMUNITY IS HERE IS HERE. IS BY FAR SEVERITIES ON 55% HERE. THREE WE ONLY HAVE THREE WAYS IN AND OUT OF TOWN. OF BOTH STATE HIGHWAYS PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY AND STATE ROUTE ONE THIRTY THREE BETTER KNOWN TO US AS LAGUNA CANYON ROAD. WHICH IS A WINDING ROAD ORDERED BY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE UTILITY POLES. WE'VE EXPERIENCED OVER SIXTY TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS SO -- VEHICLE VERSUS POLAND THAT ROAD IN THE LAST TEN YEARS CLOSING THE ROAD ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. YES I HAVE AS MANY OF DONE IN JANUARY OF VISITED PARADISE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE DISASTER THERE THAT APPLIED TO OUR COMMUNITY. PARADISE LIKELY GONNA BEACH SUFFERED FROM LIMITED INGRESS AND EGRESS. I SPOKE TO THE CAL FIRE INCIDENT COMMANDER WHO WAS ON THE SCENE THAT MORNING AND HE SAID THAT DOWN UTILITY LINES AND POLES WERE HUGE PROBLEM ON THE EVACUATION. EFFORT. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHILE FAR AS WE KNOW WAS ONE OF THE IT WAS THE ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. CAL FIRES DETERMINE THAT AT LEAST NINETEEN WILDFIRES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WERE CAUSED BY UTILITY LINES AND EQUIPMENT CAMPFIRE. IS NOT BEEN FINALLY DETERMINED BUT P. JEANNIE HAS SAID IT'S PROBABLE THAT IT WAS THEIR EQUIPMENT THE COST IT. THESE YOU KNOCK ON UNDER GROUNDING THAT YOU ALWAYS HEAR IT FROM UTILITY COMPANIES OTHERS AND OTHERS IS THAT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. THIS IS A SHORT SIGHTED ANALYSIS THE FOCUSES ONLY ON THE UP FRONT COST. WOULD YOU WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE HUMAN LOSS THE PROPERTY DAMAGE THE HEALTH HAZARDS AND COST THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE TO WATER RESOURCES FORCE AN OPEN SPACE. THE MOUNTAINS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE CREATED THE GREENHOUSE GASES EMITTED FROM ONE MAJOR WILDFIRE OFFSETS A WHOLE YOU A YEAR PRODUCTIONS. YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE THE TRUE COST OF UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES. BY RELOCATING THE UTILITY POLES UNDERGROUND AT YOUR THREE ZONES WE'RE INVESTING IN SMART INFRASTRUCTURE THAT LOOKS TO THE FUTURE -- MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE ABSORBING THE COST OF UTILITY BECAUSE WILD FLOWERS TO UTILITY RATES. I AND HIGHER INSURANCE RATES. WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE A PROGRAM THAT WILL HOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE EXPEDITE UNDERGROUND IN PROJECTS. IMPACTED JURISDICTIONS AND DEVELOP A FAIR FUNDING MECHANISM THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO ASK MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ANYBODY HERE TO SPEAK ON OPPOSE. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HEY WE HAVE.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JAMES JACK ON BEHALF OF CAL TELL. WE DO NOT HAVE AN OPPOSED POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A CONCERN -- FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE -- THESE POLLS IN ADDITION TO CARRYING THE STATE'S OWER INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO CARRY THE STATE'S COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDING HIGH SPEED BROADBAND NINE ONE ONE ACCESS AND THE LIKE -- UNFORTUNATELY COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS HAVE NO COST RECOVERY MECHANISM AS IT RELATES TO UNDERGROUND IN PROJECTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RULE TWENTY FUNDS AND ARE PROHIBITED FROM PASSING. THESE THE COST OF UNDER GROUNDING ANSWER CHARGES -- TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND SO OFTEN TIMES WHEN RULE TWENTY PROJECTS ARE APPROVED -- COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS GIVEN THE VERY HIGH COST UNDERGROUND OFTENTIMES HAVE TO JUST DISCONNECT SERVICE TO THAT UNDERGROUND IT -- PORTION OF CONDUIT -- AND SO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL UNDERGROUND AND BILLS CURRENTLY IN THE LEGISLATURE IN AND JUST WANT. TO URGE BOTH THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR -- AS WE HAVE RAISED THE P. YOU SEE TO CONSIDER CREATING A COST RECOVERY MECHANISM FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS WHO SHARE THOSE POLLS. NEWS TO ME NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN. PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC COMPANY WE ALSO DO NOT HAVE A POSITION BUT PRECIADO -- THE ABILITY TO JUST MAKE THE COMMENTS THAT WE APPRECIATE -- THE AUTHOR'S INTENT -- ON THE BILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED ON COSTS -- AND FEASIBILITY BUT WE WON IT. BUT THE AUTHOR ON HIS STAFF AND COMMITTEE. TO ADDRESS THE BROAD NATURE OF THE BILL BUT STILL SUPPORT THE IN -- OF IMPROVING SAFETY -- IN THIS NEW NORMAL THANK YOU OKAY VERY WELL OF COME TO THE MEMBER. DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENT. I DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS BUT I'LL MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU WILLOW [inaudible] MOTION [inaudible] AND THEN. AGAIN YOU DID MENTION THE AMENDMENTS WILLING EXCEPT. I WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE. AND AND AND IS THAT A YES YEAH MY IT MIGHT YOU TWISTED MY ARM AND I ACCEPTED. AMENDMENTS MISTER CHAIR. AND I MOVE THE BILL WITH THE MEN. THAT I TWISTED HIS ARM TO OBTAIN OKAY. CLOSING COMMENTS RIGHT YOUR CHAIR -- JUSTIN RESPONSE MAYBE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS. MAYBE YOU KNOW IN THIS DELIBERATION MAYBE WHAT POLLS -- ART MAY BE A THING OF THE PAST ME WITHOUT A LOOK AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I LIKE GUYS STEEL OR SOME OTHER. YOU KNOW HARDENING OF OF OF THESE POLL SO THEY DON'T JUST HAPPEN BREAK AND AND AND CROSSOVER ROAD SOMETHING. TO THINK ABOUT -- TO SOME OF THE MEDICATION CONCERNS. THEY'RE STILL LIGHT POLES. AND SO DOES COULD STILL BE UTILIZED SO THERE'S ROOM FOR GOOD DEBATE HERE. MISTER CHAIR AT THE CITY OF ANAHEIM HAS ITS OWN PUBLIC UTILITY. AND THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IT HAS HARDENED AN UNDERGROUND IT IN ITS WILDFIRES OWNS IT'S A LONG TERM PROCESS. BUT IN TWENTY YEARS THEY HAVE TAKEN CARE OF 98% OF THEIR WILDFIRE AREAS WITH THAT WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO TO COLLABORATE TOGETHER SO I THINK THIS IS A WIN WIN. AND REQUEST AND I THANK YOU SIR -- OKAY -- WE HAVE A MOTION THIS CALL THE ROLL. DO YOU PASSED TO BE AMENDED IN NATURAL RESOURCES IN WATER HUESO. I HUESO I MORE LOT. MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD CHIANG DIED. HERTZBERG ILL MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER. RIGHT SKINNER AYE STERN STONE WIENER WE ARE NOW ADDRESSING SENATE BILL SEVEN ZERO EIGHT BY SENATOR HUESO AND YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU -- I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR LET ALLOW ME TO PRESENT SB SEVEN NO. THAT IS INTENDED TO HAVE -- PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT. OF PROVIDING MORE TRANSPARENCY TO THE PUBLIC IN A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. OTHER CUTS WAS OFTEN A CONFUSED AS A STATE AGENCY ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT. HOWEVER IT IS AN AGENCY THAT WAS CREATED BY STATE STATE STATUTE. IT IS A NON PROFIT THAT IS GOVERNED BY -- CALIFORNIA STATE LAWS. AND THEY ARE. ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HI SO MANAGES THE FLOW OF THE ELECT HE CROSSED THE HIGH VOLTAGE BOUGHT OLD. OUR SYSTEM THAT MAKES UP 80% OF CALIFORNIA'S. AND A SMALL PART OF NEVADA SELECTRIC READ. IT IS ALSO REGISTERED BOTH IT'S A TRANSMISSION OPERATOR AND BALANCING AUTHORITY. AND THERE ARE EVEN PROPOSALS IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT ARE CONSIDERING GIVING CHI SO GREATER. FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING IN THE GRIP. OR GREATER AUTHORITY OVER MEN MANAGING THE BREAD. ALSO WITH OTHER BALANCING AUTHORITIES THE THE CHI SO IS. BURKE AND ARE REGULATED AS TO A FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE THEIR OPERATIONS. THIS. IMPLIES THAT THERE IS. GOVERNMENT A GIVER GOVERNMENT REGULATORY INTERVENTION ANY TIME THE GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED IN. REGULATING AN ORGANIZATION OF COURSE. A GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND KNOWLEDGE JUST. TO THE WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING INTERNALLY AND AND THE SYSTEM DECISION MAKING PROCESS. COMES IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S ALSO BEEN A INCREASED ATTENTION TO THE ROLE OF THE CLEAN ABATE. DEBATE ABOUT EXPAND ITS GREAT OPERATIONS TO OTHER STATES AND THE WESTERN UNITED STATES IF PEOPLE WERE. TWO YEARS IT'S BEEN KIND OF A DISCUSSION. ADDITIONALLY OUR RECENT ACTIVITY CONCERNING THE CHI SO HAS FURTHER INCREASE THE DESIRE. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CAUSE TO OPERATION THESE INCLUDE. PROPOSALS TO HAVE THE CHI SO PROCURE RESOURCES INCLUDING A PROPOSAL LAST YEAR [inaudible] MEGAWATTS. A PUP STORAGE. TO A FIRST OF ITS KIND TRANSMISSION ACCESS CHARGE. AND THE AREA ALSO THE INCREASED USE OF BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT BY THE CHI SO FOR RESOURCE ADDICT. AND ALSO THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE CRISIS ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET. AND ALSO THE REPLACEMENT OF PIC RELIABILITY COORDINATED SERVICES WITH THOSE OF THE CHI SO. THESE AND OTHER ISSUES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE TO MY AND MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC DESIRE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. THE CHI SOS OPERATIONS. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY INTENDED. AS AN EFFORT AGAIN AS A DIALOGUE OF WHICH OF THESE AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS UP IN A BILL -- OF THIS BILL SHOULD APPLY TO THE OPERATIONS OF THE CHI SO. THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO APPLY. MANY PROVISIONS OF OF CURRENTLY OF THAT ARE CURRENTLY PLOP PLIED TO ANY STATE AGENCY INCLUDE INCLUDING OPEN MEETINGS ACT. PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. OVERSIGHT OF THE BUDGET AND AUTHORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO CONDUCT. AN AUDIT. ALL IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE COULDN'T REQUIRE THAT OF CHI SO. AND AGAIN IF THE PUBLIC AND OF THIS LEGISLATURE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED. AT HAVING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW ON AGENCY THERE SO ESSENTIAL. TO OUR GREAT OPERATIONS. B. IS RUN. ONE AREA THAT WE WILL BE DEFINITELY ADDRESS IN IS THE NEED TO LIMIT THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. WHICH MAY BE MARKET SENSITIVE THAT IS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT OF OF HEAVEN ANY ORGANIZATION THAT HANDLES SENSITIVE. INFORMATION THAT'S CRITICAL. TO ESTABLISH SHE IN. OUR RATES PROTECTING RATES FOR THE BENEFIT OF RATE PAYERS. I HAVE WELCOME -- TO THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHI SO AS TO HOW THEIR CURRENT POLICIES IN OPERATIONS MAY SATISFY SOME OF THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENTS. THEY ARGUE THAT THEY DO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC SO -- IN IN THIS PROCESS I DON'T SEE WHY APPLYING ANY OF THOSE. PROVISIONS TO THE CARS SO WOULD IMPEDE THEIR ABILITY TO OPERATE THE ENERGY -- DE CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY COMMISSION HANDLE HANDLE SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND THAT INFORMATION. IS PROTECTED AS PROPRIETARY FOR SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY REGULATE. THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE. THAT SAME. PROTECTION. TO THE PROCESS OF OF OF OF TRADING IMBALANCE IN THE BREAD AND AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CONTINUE TO BE EFFECTIVE AT PERFORMING THE ROLE. AND YOU HAVE THE LESS IS I I I WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE I HAVE INCREASE TRANSPARENCY OF OF THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. OF ORGANIZATION SO WE HAVE A FEW WITNESSES ARE MAKES BRIEF COMMENTS -- THANK YOU SENATOR. FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK AS THE CHAIR POINTS OUT IN HIS STATEMENT THE CALIFORNIA EYES SO IS PLAYING AN INCREASINGLY CENTRAL ROLE. IN MANY STATE POLICIES AND THE EXECUTION OF OUR LONG TERM RESOURCE PLANNING AND RELIABILITY GOALS ON AND IT MAY BE TAKING ON NEW RESPONSE. THAT EXTEND ITS INVOLVEMENT INCLUDING ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW RESOURCES THAT OPERATE ON THE SYSTEM IN THAT. IN THAT FRAME WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO CONSIDER MODEST REFORMS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. THAT WOULD ASSIST THE I SO AS A CALIFORNIA NON PROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION CARRY OUT ITS FUNCTIONS IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH STATE POLICY. WE'RE PARTICULARLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE I SO PUBLICLY DISCLOSED INFORMATION RELATING TO SANCTIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF EXISTING TERRACE OR RULES OF CONDUCT BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS WERE SCHEDULING COORDINATORS. THE I SO CURRENTLY ROUTE I REFUSES TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF COMPANIES THAT VIOLATE ITS RULES OF CONDUCT CLAIMING THAT THE DISCLOSURE OF THE IDENTITIES OF THESE. COMPANIES WOULD REPRESENT PUBLIC SHAMING AND BECAUSE REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE MARKET PARTICIPANTS. I ASK YOU HOW THIS COMMITTEE WOULD RESPOND IF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WERE TO REFUSE TO DISCLOSE THE IDENTITIES OF ENTITIES THAT IT HAD SANCTIONED FOR VIOLATING ITS RULES. I'M NOT SURE THAT WOULD GET VERY FAR IN THE LEGISLATURE. ARE WE DISAGREE WITH THE I. ESOS OUR PRACTICE AND WE THINK THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS BEST SERVED BY DISCLOSING BASIC INFORMATION. ABOUT THAT ABOUT ALL VIOLATIONS THAT RESULT IN FINANCIAL PENALTIES. WE ALSO BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND THE BAGLEY KEENE OPEN MEETINGS ACT -- CURRENT LAW ONLY REQUIRES ADHERENCE TO GENERAL POLICIES OF THESE ACT AND WE THINK THAT THE I ESOS CURRENT POLICIES. WHICH ARE WEAKER THAN THOSE THAT APPLY TO STATE AGENCIES -- SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP TO SPEED -- AT AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE THAT APPLY TO ANY STATE AGENCY. SO TAKEN TOGETHER WE THINK THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL SHOULD RESULT IN CLOSER WORKING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE I SO. AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES THANK YOU. THE TERM REMEMBER SCOTT WHICH ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES A CALIFORNIA C. PATRIOTS COUNCIL TO SEE A CESSATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS IN THE WESTERN CITY COUNCIL. SHEET METAL WORKERS. STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL CAL I SO IS A PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNED BY. THE LAW OF CALIFORNIA IT SPENDS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REPAIR MONEY IN AUTHORIZES THE EXPENDITURE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REPAIR MONEY. WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE THE PUBLIC DESERVES TO BE ABLE LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS AND COMMUNICATIONS AND THE THINGS THAT THEY USE AS A BASIS FOR MAKING THOSE DECISIONS WE THINK THEY SHOULD COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE ONCE A YEAR. SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATURE HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THOSE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REPAIR FUNDS. THEY POINT TO THEIR EXISTING RULES AND REGULATIONS AND SAY THAT THOSE ARE SUFFICIENT. BUT THOSE ARE SELF GOVERNED THEY CAN CHANGE THE MOOD ANYTIME. THEIR THEIR OWN SELF ENFORCER SO WE BELIEVE IN INSTITUTIONALIZING THESE BLUE SKY TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS. AND IN HAVING THE LEGISLATURE TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN LOOKING AT THE OPERATIONS OF CALLOUS SO IS COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE. AND WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. STRETCH ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BORN COMMON THE HAVE A SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS. I GUESS MISTER CHAIR -- THIS IS FEEL PAIN GO FROM THE CALIFORNIA I SO -- WE'RE NOT IN OPPOSITION BILL IN FACT TAKEN A POSITION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION MY MY SHARE THEN. THANK YOU NAME AGAIN. OF PHIL PATTON GIL I'M A DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. AND AS I SHARED. WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION THE BILL BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION FIRST WHAT I LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF -- FOR ALREADY GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS BUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO TODAY WAS BRING TO YOU SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT OUR COURT PRACTICE. PROCEDURES DO CREATE AND SATISFY THE DESIRE FOR TRANSPARENCY THAT'S IN THIS BILL BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST SHARE WITH YOU SOME KEY INFORMATION. FIRST OF ALL WE DO REALLY PRIDE OURSELVES AS A PUBLIC ASSESSABLE ORGANIZATION AND THERE'S THREE MAIN ACTIVITIES AND PROCESS SEES THAT WE HAVE THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU. FIRST OF ALL ALL OF OUR BOARD MEETINGS ARE OPEN PUBLIC SESSIONS AND ANY DECISIONS BY THE I. SO BORED ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND RECEIVE COMMENT AND FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC AT THAT TIME. THE RECORDS AVAILABILITY OF ACT WAS MENTIONED AND WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR RECORDS AVAILABILITY POLICY YOU WERE ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC CAN COME TO THE I. SO. AND REQUEST INFORMATION AND WE RISK. IN TAKE TEN DAYS SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR A WILLINGNESS TO BE ACCOMMODATING AND TIMELY IN THOSE RESPONSES. AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE A VERY INCLUSIVE STAKEHOLDER POLICY PROCESS. AND WHAT WE DO IN THAT POLICY PROCESS IS GO THROUGH A FAIRLY REGIMENTED PROGRAM WHERE WE LAY OUT AN ISSUE RECEIVE COMMENTS. PUBLISHED THOSE COMMENTS AND CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THAT DIALOGUE UNTIL WE CAN RECONCILE SOMETHING TO BRING ULTIMATELY TO THE I. SO BOARD FOR APPROVAL AND THAT PUBLIC PROCESS THEIR MENTION. ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT WE USE IS IN FACT HOW WE APPROVE OUR ANNUAL BUDGET. SO WE OPEN UP THE STAKEHOLDER INITIATIVE RECEIVE COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC. AND THEN ULTIMATELY BRING THAT BUDGET TO THE I. SO BOARD FOR APPROVAL [inaudible] SO. I WANTED TO SHARE THE ISSUE ABOUT SOME OF THESE MAJOR INITIATIVES BECAUSE ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT OUR BUDGET IS WE HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN OUR BUDGET. CHANGE LESS THAN 1% SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IN EACH IN EACH YEAR AND YET WE STILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SOME MAJOR INITIATIVES -- BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS AND ONE OF THOSE IS THE WESTERN. ENERGY BOUNCE MARKET. AND WITHOUT MARKET WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WORKED WITH WESTERN STATE IN CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY SEE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER SAY ALMOST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SINCE. TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT IN ADDITION THAT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT THE SAME TIME. SO AGAIN THE BILL ANALYSIS REFLECTS THAT IT'S IT'S YOU GUYS SO THE COMPLICATED ORGANIZATION YOU HEARD SOME OF THAT ALREADY THIS MORNING FROM FROM. FROM THE AUTHOR AND THAT IS THAT WE ARE A NONPROFIT FIVE OH ONE C. THREE ORGANIZATION BUT WE'RE ALSO REGULATED REGULATED BY. FOR THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE WERE COMPLIANT WITH THOSE FEDERAL STANDARDS AND OBLIGATIONS AND SOME OF THAT WILL DICTATE ANY INFORMATION EXCLUDED THE DISCLOSURE THAT WE CAN DO. OUR ENFORCEMENT FOR EXAMPLE IS UNDER FOR JURISDICTION. SO ANY RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE I. SO BECAUSE WE FIND UNDO BEHAVIOR IN OUR MARKETS ULTIMATELY GETS REPORTED TO FOR FOR THAT -- THAT FINAL ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE THE ALSO A NONPROFIT CORPORATION. AND SO AS AN ASSOCIATE NECESSARILY WE NEED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE RULES THANKS FOR ALL RAP HERE IN JUST SECONDS. ONE OF THE THINGS SO THAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT WE CONTINUALLY WORK WITH STATE AGENCIES IN PROVIDING INFORMATION. AS THEIR IMPLEMENTING THE POLICIES AND IN PARTICULAR THEIR ADOPTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND SO OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IMPLEMENTING OUR PS AND SOME OF THE MORE -- AMBITIOUS ENERGY POLICIES HAVE BEEN FRONT AND CENTER FOR US. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS WRAP BY SAYING JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE THINGS WE ARE DOING. AN ENGAGING HERE AND CERTAINLY THEN I'LL STOP HERE AND INVITE ANY QUESTIONS BUT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS. THANKS FOR COMING ANY QUESTIONS. MY COLLEAGUES. YOU HAVE A YOU'VE ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS I THINK I I WAS GOING TO ASK TO BUT YOU HAVE TO HOLD CLOSE SESSIONS WHICH THEN. WITH THE LIMIT TO THE INFORMATION OF WHO IS BEING DISCUSSED OR DOES THE AGENDA SAY. WHAT BERMS ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN CLOSED SESSION WHICH IS CUSTOMARY IN? OTHER MUNICIPAL ACTIVITIES YEAH THE THE WAY THE PROCESS BASICALLY WORKS IS WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF MARKET MONITORING THAT IS ACTUALLY. REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE ISO BOARD AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE CONFIDENTIAL UNDER RULES THAT ARE APPLIED BY FIRST. AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY THEN TO DIRECTLY REPORT TO FOR ANY CONCERNS ABOUT PARTIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THESE MARKETS. ULTIMATELY THE OUTCOME OF THOSE. DECISIONS BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION ARE POSTED ON THEIR WEBSITE AND THE FIRMS ARE NOTICED. IN TERMS OF THEY FOUND WERE VIOLATING MARKET RULES. THANK YOU. NO I SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS DRIVE EMOTION. I HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A CLOSING COMMENT A SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY ALL RIGHT MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
