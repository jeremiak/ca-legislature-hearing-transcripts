HEARING AT SOME LEE BUDGET COMMITTEE. NUMBER TWO ON EDUCATION FINANCE BUT WE CAN TAKE THE ROLE PLEASE. MCCARTY HERE. CHÃ¡VEZ. MEDINA. VOEPEL. QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED. OKAY TODAY WE HAVE A VARIETY TOPICS FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO THE. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE WILL START OFF WITH THERE ARE. TWO ISSUES WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE GE'S. PLAYED TO APPRENTICESHIP AND CERTIFIED NURSE. SO ISSUE NUMBER ONE. ALEJO'S GOING TO GO FIRST ON THE SIDEWALK THROUGH THE BACK CLEAR. OKAY WE'RE GONNA START FIRST WITH THE LA A CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PAUL STEINHAUSEN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE SERGEANT IS DISTRIBUTING A HAND OUT TO YOU. TITLED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. AND THE HAND OUT PROVIDES BACKGROUND AND INFORMATION. NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ASSESSMENT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. SO PAGE ONE OF THE HANDOUT. SHOWS THAT APPRENTICESHIP. WHICH IS OFTEN CALLED THE BURNING WHILE LEARNING MODEL. INVOLVES SPONSORS ARE THE SPONSORS ARE EMPLOYERS AND TRADE UNIONS AND AND OTHERS LABOR UNIONS. AT THEY RECRUIT APPRENTICES IN THE APPRENTICES ARE PAID WAGES WHILE THEY TRAIN ON THE JOB. AND AFTER BUSINESS HOURS. THE APPRENTICES ATTEND CLASSES S. CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION IT'S KNOWN AS RELATED SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION OR RSI SUCH THEIR CLASSROOM TIME. AND TYPICALLY YOU FINDS APPRENTICES IN BUILDING TRADES IN PUBLIC SAFETY SUCH AS. FIREFIGHTING RESEARCH INDICATES THAT APPRENTICESHIP IS AN EFFECTIVE MODEL. FOR OUR TRAINING WORKERS. AND CALIFORNIA HAS A GOAL TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF APPRENTICES IN THE STATE BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. PAGE TWO YOU LOOK ON PAGE TWO. OF THE HAND OUT. NOTES THAT THE STATE HELPS TO SUBSIDIZE SOME OF THE SPONSORS CLASSROOM. COSTS SO SOME OF THOSE RSI COSTS THAT THAT THE APPRENTICES MUST UNDER GO THAT STATE HELPS TO PAY FOR SOME OF THAT A PORTION. IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE STATE IS PROVIDING FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR RSI NOW THROUGH CATEGORICAL PROGRAM. AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE STATE HAS A SECOND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM A NEW APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM POP CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. ARE A NET INITIATIVE WHICH PROVIDES GRANTS AS SEED MONEY. TWO SPONSORS TO COMMUNICATE ALL AGES AND SCHOOLS TO ESTABLISH. NONTRADITIONAL APPRENTICESHIPS WHAT'S BEEN TRADITIONALLY NONTRADITIONAL WHICH IS IN THE AREAS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. AND AND AND SOME OTHER AREAS. AS WELL HEALTH CARE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE. SO TO QUALIFY FOR THE STATE ARE A SIGH FUNDING SO THAT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS SPONSORS HAVE TO PARTNER WITH KATE TWELFTH WHICH IS TYPICALLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND TYPICALLY WHAT YOU SEE IS APPRENTICESHIPS. REGISTER PROGRAMS HAVE THEIR OWN STAND ALONE TRAINING CENTER NOT IT BETWEEN THE COLLEGE HERE AT SCHOOL IT'S AROUND STANDALONE TRAIN CENTER THE TRADE THAT LABOR UNION MIGHT RUN FOR EXAMPLE. AND THE SPONSORS EMPLOY THEIR OWN INSTRUCTORS. WHAT YOU SEE THEN IS? THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S INCOMMUNICADO EDGES WILL TAKE A PORTION OF THE RSI THE CLASSROOM COSTS TO KIND OF. HAVE A GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM. AND THEN THE SPONSORS GET THE LION'S SHARE OF THE RSI AGAIN TO HELP SUBSIDIZE THE COST FOR FOR CLASSROOM TRAINING. PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT NOTES THAT ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF APPRENTICESHIP CLASSES. OUR AFFILIATE BETTER FOR AFFILIATED WITH COMMUNICATIVE IS OUR CREDIT KNOWN AS CREDIT WHICH MEANS THAT THE COURSE UNITS CAN APPLY TOWARD AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE. TYPICALLY IT'S ASIDE IS ASSIGNED A SELECTIVE UNITS. THE REMAINING TEN PERCENT OF COMMITTEE COLLEGE AFFILIATED COURSES AS WELL AS ALL SCHOOL AFFILIATED. A. CLASSES ARE CONSIDERED NON CREDIT OR NOT FOR CREDIT. BUT WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S CREDIT FOR NOT CREDIT. THE CONTENT IS IS SIMILAR IT'S COMPARABLE I AND ALL OF THE PROGRAM'S WHETHER NONCREDIT CREDIT. SCHOOL AFFILIATED RESULT IN INDUSTRY CERTIFICATIONS WHICH IS WHAT WORKERS NEED TO. TO BE IN THEIR INDUSTRY AND AND PRACTICE OUR TRADE ON A ON A PERMANENT BASIS. PAGE FOUR. OF THE HANDOUT NOTES THAT WHETHER RSI IS OFFERED ON A CREDIT OR NON CREDIT BASIS OR BY SCHOOL OR BY COMMUNITY COLLEGE. STATE FUNDS ARE A SIGH BASED ON THE REGULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE NINE CREDIT RATE. AND IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT STATUTORY HOURLY RATE IS FIVE DOLLARS NINETY CENTS WHICH EQUATES TO ABOUT THIRTY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT NFT <u><c.green>.</c></u> IN RECENT YEARS THE AMOUNT OF RSI HOURS THAT SPONSORS HAVE PROVIDED TO APPRENTICES. HAS EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE STATE HAS BUDGETED. FOR RSI. AND AS A RESULT PURSUANT TO STATUTE THE STATE HAS MADE PRO RATA REDUCTIONS. AND THESE REDUCTIONS HAVE. HAVE RESULTED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OR SO. IN REDUCTION OF ABOUT ONE PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. I AND ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY FOUR PERCENT PRO RATA REDUCTIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. SO INSTEAD OF PROVIDING FIVE DOLLARS NINETY CENTS PER STUDENT PER CLASSROOM OUR THE STATE IS PROVIDING AN AVERAGE ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS TO THE SPONSORS THIS YEAR. NOW DESPITE THESE PRO RATA REDUCTIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS SPONSORS HAVE. INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY THE NUMBER OF RSI HOURS THEY PROVIDE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE FIGURE ON THE NEXT PAGE. YOU CAN SEE THOSE HOURS CONTINUE TO GROW. AND THIS REALLY IS EVIDENCE OF. THE VALUE SPONSORS PLACE ON APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS PROVIDING NEEDED. A WORKERS TRAIN WORKERS FOR THEIR INDUSTRY. SO PAGE SIX DESCRIBES THE GOVERNOR'S THREE PROPOSALS ON APPRENTICESHIP. YOU SEE THE FIRST CHECK BOX ON PAGE SIX THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME MONEY. TO MAKE UP FOR THE PRO RATA REDUCTIONS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND. AND THE CURRENT YEAR. NOT PROPOSAL DOES NOT PLACE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THESE FUNDS. THE SECOND PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR IS TO PROVIDE SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. FOR OUR SI. MOST OF THAT A. DOLLAR AMOUNT IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ARE A SITE FOR A MORE OUR SITE HOURS TO FIND MORE HOURS. AND IT WOULD BRING THE BUDGET YEAR HOURS UP TO WHAT'S EXPECTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND ABOUT JUST UNDER UNDER NINE MILLION HOURS AGAIN WHICH IS EXPECTED AND. IN THE CURRENT YEAR INTO FUND THAT AGAIN AND IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THE REST OF THE MONEY THAT ONGOING MONIES ASSOCIATE WITH INCREASING THE RSI RATE. TO SIX DOLLARS AND FORTY NINE CENTS AGAIN FROM FIVE DOLLARS NINETY CENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR STATUTORY RATE. THERE'S A THIRD PROPOSAL HERE THE GOVERNOR HAS. AND THAT WOULD ALLOW SOME COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPRENTICESHIP COURSES TO GENERATE FUNDING AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE TEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY EIGHT CENTS. PER HOUR WHICH WOULD WHICH IS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE PROPOSED SIX DOLLARS FORTY NINE CENT RSI RATE. SO AGAIN THAT WOULD BE JUST ANA A CERTAIN PORTION OF. OF APPRENTICESHIP RSI OWE IT WOULD GET THAT HIGHER RATE IN THE FUNDING WOULD BE PAID OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE GENERAL PURPOSE POT OF MONEY SO THE OF APPORTIONMENT. I'D RATHER THAN THE APPRENTICESHIP CATEGORICAL PROGRAM. TO EARN THE HIGHER FUNDING RATE APPRENTICESHIP COURSES WOULD HAVE TO BE TAUGHT BY COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTORS RATHER THAN. SPONSORS INSTRUCTOR. AND THE GOVERNOR INDICATES THAT HIS PROPOSAL COULD INCENTIVIZE MORE COLLEGES TO OFFER CREDIT APPRENTICESHIPS. SO PAGE SEVEN SUMMARIZES OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THOSE THREE PROPOSALS. WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S FIRST PROPOSAL. STATE LAW MAKES CLEAR THAT IF STATE FUNDING IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL OF THE HOURS THAT SPONSORS ARE PROVIDING SPONSORS NEED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO STAY WITHIN THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET ALLOCATION. DESPITE KNOWING THAT STAMPER STATE REIMBURSEMENT WAS LIKELY TO BE PRO RATED DOWNWARD AFTER ALL IT'S BEEN PRETTY DOWNWARD EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. SPONSORS CONTINUE TO COVER THESE COSTS AND THE PROGRAM CONTINUED TO GROW RAPIDLY SO EMPLOYERS FELT THAT IT WAS WORTH IT THAT OUT TO KICK IN THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE CLASSROOM HOURS. SO AS A RESULT WE DON'T SEE A COMPELLING REASON FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE RETROACTIVE REIMBURSEMENTS. WITH REGARD TO THIS GOVERNOR SECOND PROPOSAL. WE WE HAD KNOWLEDGE SO THAT WELL THOUGH PROVIDING RETROACTIVE RSI HOURS MIGHT NOT BE NECESSARY WE DO AGREE WITH WITH THIS THAT THE STATE SHOULD TRY TO AVOID. FUTURE PRO RATA REDUCTIONS DO WHATEVER I CAN TO. TO AVOID THOSE FUTURE REDUCTIONS WE ARE CONCERNED A BIT THAT AS. CURRENTLY PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR THE AUGMENTATION MAY NOT BE ENOUGH THOUGH. ARE IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO FULLY ALIGN FUNDING WITH THE PROJECTED HOURS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AS I AS I'VE DESCRIBED ON ON PAGE SIX PREVIOUS PAGE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD FIND THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AS IN AS WHAT'S EXPECTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND GIVEN RECENT GROWTH TRENDS SPONSORS LIKELY ARE GOING TO EXCEED THAT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LEVEL. AND IF THEY DO. WE'RE GONNA END UP IN THE SAME POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A STATE TO HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER ROUND OF PRO RATA REDUCTIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO THE THIRD DIED. CHECK BOX YOU. WE WE REALLY KIND OF OUR SAXMAN IS WE DON'T THINK THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE CREDIT RATE FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE CREDIT APPRENTICESHIP COURSES IS WARRANTED. THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO EXPAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPRENTICESHIPS YET VIRTUALLY ALL. VIRTUALLY ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPRENTICESHIP COURSES ARE ARE ARE ALREADY. OFFERED ON A CREDIT BASIS. AND GIVEN HOW QUICKLY APPRENTICESHIPS HAVE BEEN GROWING IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE ALREADY IS ON TRACK TO REACH A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND. APPRENTICESHIPS BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN WHICH IS THE GOAL OF THE STATE HAS SET. OUR FOURTH THE KIND OF ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD RESULT IN EVEN GREATER INCONSISTENCY IN RULES UP FOR SIMILAR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THIS IS ALREADY A COMPLEX SYSTEM OF PAYMENT AND IT WOULD REALLY FURTHER COMPLICATE APPRENTICESHIPS BY PROVIDING A HIGHER FUNDING RATE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FUNNY RATE FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE. RSI POWERS THOSE CREDIT HOURS BUT NOT FOR OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPRENTICESHIP R. S. HOURS ARE NOT FOR SCHOOLS EITHER THE SCHOOLS WOULDN'T GET THAT HIGHER RATE. AYE EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THIS CONTENT IS COMPARABLE. SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ON PAGE EIGHT. THREE RECOMMENDATIONS FIRST TO REJECT THE RETROACTIVE REIMBURSEMENTS SECOND TO APPROVE ACTUALLY MORE THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ON ON GOING BASIS TO PROVE TWENTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS RATHER THAN SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT. MILLION AND THAT WOULD FIND TEN PERCENT GROWTH IN OUR ESSAY OFF RSI HOURS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHICH IS. THE AVERAGE GROWTH OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND GOING FOR FORWARD FOR LEGISLATURE. REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT SPONSORS ARE PROVIDING AND TRY TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS ANNUALLY TO AGAIN TO AVOID MORE OF THESE PRO RATA REDUCTIONS IN FUTURE YEARS. THIRD RECOMMENDATION ITS REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO EARN THAT. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE FOR CERTAIN CREDIT APPRENTICESHIP COURSES. THANK YOU. OKAY. BERMAN A FINANCE. GOOD MORNING CARE MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AMONG THE BECAUSE OF WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I APPRECIATE THE DETAILED OVERVIEW THAT PAUL JUST PROVIDED THE CABLE COMPREHENSION COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF HOW PARTNERSHIP. FUNDING WORKS IS THAT IS A PRETTY COMPLICATED ISSUE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF FORTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. OF THIS AMOUNT THIRTY POINT SIX MILLION HAS PROVIDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO FUND SHORTFALLS IN RSI FUNDING. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. WE ARE PROPOSING TO FIND THESE PER YEAR SHORT FALLS IN OUR SIDE REIMBURSEMENTS BECAUSE THE STATE IS STATUTORILY EXPECTED TO PAY FOR THE COST OF THE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTIONAL COMPONENT. OF AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERFUNDED IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND PROGRAM SPONSORS HAVE HAD TO COVER THE COSTS OF THESE UNFUNDED REIMBURSEMENTS. THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THIS IS A GOOD USE OF AVAILABLE PROP NINETY PROP NINETY EIGHT ONE TIME REVENUES THIS YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION AND ON GOING REIMBURSEMENTS. FOR PROGRAMS FOR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL POWERS PROVIDED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AT AN INCREASED RSI HOURLY RATE OF SIX DOLLARS AND FORTY NINE CENTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. CONSISTENT WITH THE PAST THREE YEARS THE BUDGET CONTINUES TO INCLUDE FIFTEEN MILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE. WHICH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF MINIATURE ADMINISTERS THE RECOUP PETTED OF GRANT PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE START UP AND IMPLEMENTATION COSTS FOR NEW AND INNOVATIVE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND EMERGING NONTRADITIONAL SECTORS. AND FOR PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CLAIM REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH THE COLLEGE CREDIT APPORTIONMENT RATE. RATHER THAN RSI RATE FOR ELIGIBLE APPRENTICESHIP COURSES. SPECIFICALLY ONLY FOUR CREDIT COURSES TAUGHT BY COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTORS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO BE AROUND REIMBURSED AT THE HIGHER CREDIT APPORTIONMENT OPTION. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS REQUESTED THIS ALTERNATIVE REIMBURSEMENT OPTION FOR SEVERAL REASONS. IT WILL ENCOURAGE MORE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO BE CREATED IN THE STATE. THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT OR WE GO ON REQUIRES EACH STATE TO DEVELOP A WORKFORCE PLAN AND CALIFORNIA'S PLANT EXPECTS TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF TRAINED APPRENTICES BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SEVEN. WE WOULD EXPECT THAT SOME CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE GRANT RECIPIENTS. WOULD COLLABORATE WITH THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SPONSORS AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM CURRICULUM. TO HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY MEMBERS TEACH THESE SOME OF THESE COURSES THAT THEY COULD CLAIM THE HIGHER RATE. ALSO COMMUNITY COLLEGES OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE TAUGHT BY COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAD POINTED OUT THAT OUR PROPOSAL WHERE ENCOURAGE COLLEGES TO SEEK OUT A NEW APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM SPONSORED. TO CREATE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THE PETE WOULD BE ALIGNED WITH THAT CERTIFICATE PROGRAM. CURRENTLY COLLEGES HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO TRY TO BUILD IT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THEIR CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE REIMBURSED AT A MUCH LOWER RATE. A PROPOSED APPORTIONMENT REIMBURSEMENT OP SOON ALSO WAS EXPECTED TO FREE UP SOME ARE S. SITE FUNDING DEMAND. COULD BE USED TO FUND PROGRAM EXPANSIONS IN BOTH KATE TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SPONSORED PROGRAMS. THAT WOULD STILL CLAIM THE RSI APPORTIONMENT. AND IT WOULD PROVIDE OUR SITE REIMBURSEMENTS TO NEW APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT ARE STARTED UP THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE ONCE THEY'RE UP AND RUNNING. FOR COURSES THAT ARE NOT REIMBURSED BY THE APPORTIONMENT CREDIT RIGHT. ALSO BY ENCOURAGING COLLEGES TO BEGIN MORE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THEY COULD CLAIM THE APPORTIONMENT RATE. WOULD HELP COLLEGES INCREASE THEIR FTA ELSE AT A TIME WHEN MANY COLLEGES ARE EXPERIENCING DECLINING ENROLLMENTS. WE WILL BE REVISING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THE MAY REVISION TO CLARIFY THAT APPRENTICESHIP COURSE WORK THAT IS REIMBURSED THROUGH THE APPORTIONMENT PROCESS. WILL BE BASED ON THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS PROVIDED TO. APPRENTICES WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE PROCESS FOR THE RSI REIMBURSEMENT. IT SUMMARIZES OUR PROPOSAL AND I'M HAPPY TO ENTER. THANK YOU COMMUNITY COLLEGES BY KRISHNASWAMY OF RESTAURANTS WHERE THE COMPANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS REPRESENT WHAT WE THINK IS REASONABLE BUDGETING PRACTICES. THOUGHT YOU KNOW AS YOU HEARD THERE IS A ONE TIME PROPOSAL WE THINK A. TRUING UP RATES FOR. THAT WE COMMITTED TO IN STATUTE IS A REASONABLE WAY TO. TO ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS WE THINK IT'S AT A REASONABLE USE OF THE THIRTY ONE MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS. FOR THE SECOND SET OF ADJUSTMENTS THE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO A BOTH REVISED THE RATES AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOURS PER REMEMBER SAYING. WE THINK THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH HOW YOU ARE TYPICALLY BUDGET FOR PROGRAMS THAT HAVE NOT THAT ARE DRIVEN BY ENROLLMENT CASELOAD POPULATION. WITH REGARD TO THE FINAL TRAILER BILL CHANGED AUTHORIZED COURSES IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO RECEIVE THE CREDIT RATE WE THINK THAT IT'S A. REASONABLE BUDGET PRACTICE TO FUND CREDIT COURSES AT THE SAME RATE REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY'RE TAUGHT AND SO WE THINK IT ALLIANCE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WITH HOW WE FIND OTHER CREDIT INSTRUCTION IN OUR COLLEGES. I WOULD JUST NOTE THOUGH THAT WE ARE MAKING AS YOU ALL HAVE DISCUSSED A PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE ARE CONSIDERING. A BROADER CHANGES TO OUR FUNDING FORMULA IN OUR APARTMENT SYSTEM AND SO WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO CONSIDER. HOW THIS PROPOSAL FITS INTO THAT? INTOBACK CONSTRUCT WHATEVER CONSTRUCT LEGISLATURE'S. AB ANSWER QUESTIONS. I KNOW WE HAVE A PUBLIC. COMMENTS AT THE END THE END THEY HAVE AND JUST FORGET ABOUT IT IN THE. IN THE HOUSES TALKS ABOUT ONE LETTER WE GOT FROM THERE. FIREFIGHTERS IT TALKED ABOUT HIS NEW A PORSCHE APPORTIONMENT FUNDING. WILL BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF HOW THEY STRUCTURE THEIR THEIR THEIR PROGRAMS AND THE TRADITIONALLY RELY ON THE OLD SYSTEM ARE SIZE SO YOU WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT THAT. I THINK THIS IS THE ISSUE THE THE PUBLIC FINANCE RAISED AROUND YOU KNOW THEIR COMMITMENT IN THE MAY REVISION TO FUND IT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF HOURS ME FOR THE SAME CONCERNS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO AND I THINK WE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. OKAY. FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. VOEPEL. JUST A COMMENT. ON THE ISSUE OF. PROVIDING ONE SIZE FITS ALL FUNDING CERTAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS FOR THEIR DISTRICTS FOR THEIR AREA IN SAN DIEGO. WERE OF A MARITIME OUR AREA AND WE NEED WELDERS HIGH TECHNOLOGY ELECTRICITY AND STRINGING HUNDRED SOME MILES OF FIBER OPTIC CABLE SO IT'S NOT JUST A REGULAR ELECTRICITY NEED ADVANCED TRAINING SHIP FETTERS. ON AND ON SO. WE DEFINITELY. CAN NOT HAVE ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND. AS FAR AS THE FUNDING GOES WHO WE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEND THE MONEY TO THE HIGHEST USE POSSIBLE IN WHICH CASE I CAN UNDERSTAND ON THE. ACCOUNTING PEOPLE WANTED TO HAVE LIKE A A FLAT RATE FOR EVERYONE IN EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR. BUT. IT THE END OF THE DAY BEAN COUNTERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO COUNT DIFFERENT SIZE BEINGS. THANK YOU. THAT'S YOUR JOB WITH. THANK YOU FOR THE PROPER PRESENTATION FOR THE. APARTMENT OF. FINANCE. SQUASH QUESTION THE GODFATHER PART IS WHITE OKAY. FROM MY YOUR YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS THE. SYSTEM WORKING THE COURT SYSTEM WE HAVE WORKING. I WOULD SAY IT'S WORKING REALLY WELL BUT I MEAN THE NUMBER OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS HAS BEEN GROWING. YOU KNOW I THINK. IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO TRY TO REIMBURSE PROGRAMS FOREST PAUL MENTIONED PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN UNDERFUNDED FOR YEARS BUT THEY'VE CONTINUED. TO EXPAND THEIR PROGRAM SO THERE'S OBVIOUSLY GETTING KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING THEN THE APPRENTICES ARE NEEDED. WE JUST FEEL THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE KIND OF MAKING GOOD ON ITS COMMITMENT TO FUND THESE INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS. THANK YOU FROM. FROM. CHRISTIAN. THANK YOU MANY COLLEGE AS YOUR OFFICE. WHEN YOU ESTABLISH A CRITERIA FOR THE CERTIFICATES. OR THE DEGREES WHO ESTABLISHES THE CRITERIA. I AM GOING TO OF ART IN GENERAL OR IN. WITH REGARD TO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE ARE CROSSING GUARD TO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IF YOU'RE GONNA BE THE STUDY. CERTIFICATE FOR A ISSUE A SHIP BUILDER ELECTRICIAN. OR. WHO ESTABLISHES THAT CRITERIA FOR DISC? I'M GONNA DEFERRED IN MY COLLEAGUE COPIER AMERO BICU. WHO WERE STRUGGLING MUSICIANS HAVE A MAN IN SACRAMENTO MEDINA AND JUST OFFICE THANK YOU? ARM. IF IT'S AN APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM THERE'S A SPONSOR. THAT'S THAT'S AN EMPLOYER. THAT WILL DETERMINE THE STANDARDS THAT WILL THEN BE APPROVED BY THE VISION APPENDAGE OF STANDARDS. SO IT WOULD BE THE INDUSTRY WILL BE DRIVING. THE STANDARDS OF ANY APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM. SO I THOUGHT AND SO THE. THE ISSUE ABOUT HAVE BEEN. INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF UP FACULTY TEACH. IS A. IS THIS UNIQUE TO THE FACULTY I MEAN TO THE. COMMITTEE COLLEGES OURS AND ADDS ON TO THE SURPRISE PROGRAM THIS THAT WAS BY THE INDUSTRY OR. WHATEVER CLASSES OF THE TEACHING WELL ARE I'M THINK WHO AND REFERENCE TO LIKE IF THE INCREASE IN THE RATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE. FOR CREDIBLE AND COURSES IS WE HAVE TODAY EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WE THINK COULD BE LEVERAGE TO DEVELOP IN A PATCH OF TRAINING PROGRAM. SO WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT. AND. AN EXISTING PROGRAM BE IT IN WELDING. FOR EXAMPLE THAT THAT WOULD FORCE THAT INSTRUCTION IN THAT CURRICULUM. TO BE RECONCILED WITH THAT EMPLOYER AND WHICH THEN THEY WOULD AGREE ON. YOU KNOW HOW THAT CURRICULUM BEST CONCEPTS A STANDARD SO. SO WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD. ACTUALLY HELP IN THE LINING. COURSES AND PROGRAMS WITH INDUSTRY NEEDS AND AN ARM. AND OUT IN PRECARIOUS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION LATER ON AND HEARING TODAY ABOUT CG  <u><c.green>AND I THINK. IN THE SIX</c></u> YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE THERE'S BEEN THIS WHOLE. DISCUSSION ABOUT MOVING. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE RELEVANCY OF EDUCATION AND JOBS. AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING A LOT TO GET THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. MY THE PARTNER FINANCES A YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM IS WORKING WELL. IT EYES I LOOK AT IT BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO BEEN WE'VE UNDERFUNDED COMMUNICABLE JUST QUITE A BIT IN THE. WHY AGREE WITH THE LA JOH NA WHY SHOULD WE RETROACTIVELY THREE FUNDED THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET IT BECAUSE OF THE? BUSINESS COMMUNITY SUPPORT. ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE SO. MY POSITION IS I WOULD PROBABLY YOU. REJECT THAT ELEMENT STRICTLY BECAUSE I'M TRYING HEALTH COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE. BUT I ALSO AGREE WITH THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION THAT WE. DO THE TWENTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING AUGMENTATION. DEFINE THE ANTICIPATED OUR SIDE HOURS IS I THINK HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT WE. THIS IS A GROWING AREA WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS I THINK THAT'S A VERY SMART RECOMMENDATION BY THE LA THOUGH. AND. AND AS FAR AS THE PROPOSAL FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSIGNIFICANT HIGHER RATES. FOR CREDIT PRESENTATION JUST AS DISCUSSED HERE. THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE INDUSTRIES AND. SO I DON'T SEE WHY WE'RE DOING THAT SO. I WOULD AGREE WITH THE LA THOSE SECOND AND THIRD RECOMMENDATION FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH I. I'M. THESE ARE BIG NUMBERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT AREA. FOR THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE SO. THANKS THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS. YES MA'AM. I JUST LIKE TO COMMENT ON YOUR YOUR. COMMENT ABOUT THEM NOT FUNDING THE ADDITIONAL RSI HOURS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE ESTIMATES THAT WE GET IN. EVEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ARE STILL ESTIMATES THERE STILL PROJECTIONS AND WE'VE JUST RECEIVED I GUESS EVERY SPRING. THE. BOTH K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SPONSORS SUBMIT REVISED RSI HOURS THERE PROVIDING TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND THEN WE WILL ADJUST THEM SO MAY REVISION WILL LIKELY ADJUST THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OR SI HOURS. SO WE THINK IT'S KIND OF PREMATURE TO FIND PROJECTED EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HOURS WHEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ISN'T EVEN CERTIFIED YET. SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT NEXT YEAR WE WILL PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MEET THE PERSON. THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PROJECTIONS WHEN THE DATA IS A LITTLE BIT MORE. SHARE YOUR OPINION THAT THE LA THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR. ANTICIPATED OUR SIZES IS. LITTLE TOO EARLY. SO YOU'RE SAYING BASICALLY WE THINK WE SHOULD WAIT ANOTHER YEAR UNTIL WE HAVE MUCH BETTER. PROJECTIONS THE DATA CERTIFIED THAT THESE HOURS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN PROVIDED MY ONLY CONCERN WOULD BE IS THAT I THINK THIS IS A GROWING AREA. AND IF WE SHOULD S. SUBMIT. BY DOING THIS ACTION IT WOULD BE SENATOR MESSAGE THE COMMUNICABLE EDGES. AND THE. INDUSTRIES THAT ARE DOING THE CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS THAT THIS IS GONNA BE CONTINUE INVESTMENT BY THE STATE IN THIS AREA. I AGREE WITH YOU AS FAR AS THE FUNDING ISSUE. BUT I THINK WE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO. PUSH US AS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION. I THINK WE'RE ALSO HOPING THAT ARE PROPOSAL TO ALLOW SOME COURSES TO BE FUNDED TO APPORTIONMENT WOULD FREE UP OUR INSIDE OUT ON OUR SIDE AHLERS. AND THOSE DOLLARS COULD ACTUALLY BE USED TO FUND EXPANSIONS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THIS POINT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HASN'T PAPER TO GIVE US YOU KNOW AN IDEA ABOUT HOW MANY COURSES MIGHT SHIFT AT A PORTION RIGHT NOW CHANCES GODDESS WHO WORKED AT HOME. HERE THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO A LOT OF AREAS. THIS PROBABLY MY LAST HEARING ON THIS AND I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING IN THIS. PLACE AT THE END OF THE YEAR BUT. JUST I'M VERY HAPPY HOW THIS IS GONE OVER THE SIX YEARS NINE ONE CONTINUE TO GO TO. THAT'S WHY I'M WAYNE AND THOSE POINT. BUT I APPRECIATE. YOU COMMENT I'D BE HERE NOW THAT YOU HAVE PROBABLY TAKEN UP BUT I'M NOT. OKAY THANK YOU AND WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE HEARING ON ALL THESE MISCELLANEOUS TOPICS. THING NO MORE. I QUESTIONS THAT WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. ISSUE NUMBER TWO CERTIFIED NURSES. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING AGAIN MOLLY COSWORTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT S. B. NINETY SEVEN REQUIRED THAT CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS WERE CMA'S. WHO WORK AT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAVE TO PROVIDE AT LEAST TWO POINT FOUR HOURS OF DIRECT CARE SERVICES? PER DAY FOR EACH PATIENT. THIS NEW STEPPING REQUIREMENT WILL GO INTO EFFECT ON JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE NURSING CARE FOR CHRONICALLY ILL OR SHORT TIME SHORT TERM RESIDENTS. ALONG WITH REHAB AND SPECIALIZED MEDICAL PROGRAMS. C. N. A.'S PROVIDE BASIC NURSING ASSISTANCE AND HELP RESIDENTS WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. AND PLAY A KEY ROLE IN RESIDENT CARE. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ESTIMATES THAT OVER FORTY PERCENT OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WILL HAVE TO INCREASE THEIR C. N. A STEPPING LEVELS TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW MINIMUM STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED ADDITIONAL CSA'S WILL BE NEEDED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO HELP ADDRESS THIS ANTICIPATED SHORTAGE THE GOVERNORS BUDGET INCLUDES TWO MILLION AND ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUNICABLE EDGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WOULD ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS TO STRONG WORKFORCE REGIONAL CONSORTIA TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CDNAS BEING TRAINED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. CURRENTLY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE COLLEGES OFFER THE CERTIFICATE PROGRAM WHICH TYPICALLY CAN BE COMPLETED IN ONE SEMESTER. AND REQUIRES ONE HUNDRED HOURS OF SUPERVISED TRAINING THAT USUALLY OCCURS AT THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. I WILL BE SPEAKING ON THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM IN A LATER LATER AGENDA ITEM THIS MORNING. BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. TO DEVELOP JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS AND EIGHT GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS ACROSS THE STREET. WHICH ARE LINED WITH THE REGION'S LOCAL LABEL MYRRH LABOR MARKET DEMAND. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ABOUT FORTY SIX MILLION OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION PROVIDED FOR THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. WAS SPENT ON PROGRAMS TO TRAIN STUDENTS IN A VARIETY OF HEALTH CARE FIELDS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE CNA NURSING TRAINING PERCY ANY TRAINING PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION FOR THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING FUND WHICH IS FUNDED BY A TAX ON CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS. TO PROVIDE TRAINING FUNDS FOR EMPLOYERS TO IMPROVE THE SKILLS OF THEIR WORKERS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT SOME OF THIS ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION WILL GO OUT THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH SKILLED NERVE NURSING FACILITIES. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CDNAS BEING TRAINED. THIS PART OF FUNDING IS BEING CONSIDERED IN A SEPARATE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'D BE HAPPY AT YOUR QUESTIONS. ELIOT. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTAINS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS RELATED TO A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT CNA STAFFING. AND THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THE. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ADDRESSES MEDI CAL FUNDING FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. TO HELP THEM MEET THEIRHIGHER STAFFING COSTS THAT WILL BE EXPECTED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. HAS A PROPOSAL HAS A PROPOSAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF. PUBLIC HEALTH'S BUDGET. EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL OF FUNDING WHICH. MISS BECAUSE OF I JUST MENTIONED. AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THIS PROPOSAL FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SUPPORTED GRANTS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO OUR OFFICES. CLOSE TO RELEASING AN ANALYSIS THAT COVERS ALL OF THESE ARE PROPOSALS THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS TODAY OF COURSE RISK SUBCOMMITTEE IS FOCUSING JUST ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. PIECE OF THAT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME AND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GRANTS AND. YOUR COLLEAGUES IN OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES WILL COVER THOSE OTHER ISSUES. SO. AS ARE MISSED BECAUSE OF OCT MENTIONED THE NEW STATE LAW GOES INTO EFFECT JULY FIRST AND IT'S GOING TO RESULT IN HUNDREDS OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. NEEDING TO HIRE A TOTAL OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND MORE CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS AND THE CNAC REALLY PROVIDE. THE KIND OF THE BACKBONE OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IN TERMS OF THE TRACK CARE THEY PROVIDE HELPING. PATIENTS PRIMARILY OLDER ADULTS WITH BATHING FEEDING THEM DRESSING ON THE AND THOSE SORTS OF TASKS. TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO ASSIST SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN THE NEAR TERM BY PROVIDE BY FUNDING MORE. SLOTS MORE TRAINING SLOTS. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE MODIFY THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL IN TWO WAYS NOT ALL GO OVER THOSE TWO. FIRST THE GOVERNOR LIMITS IS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GRANT PROPOSAL TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CNA TRAINING PROGRAMS YET THE SCHOOL DISTRICT RUN ADULT SCHOOLS OF WHICH ARE ALSO FUNDED BY PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. I ACTUALLY. OFFER EVEN MORE TRAINING PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I INCLUDING ADULT SCHOOLS IN THESE GRANTS WITH US BROADEN THE REACH OF THE FUNDING. ALLOW. MORE REGIONS AND IN COMMUNITIES TO HAVE A. A PROGRAM HEREBY THAT THEY COULD BE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SLOTS IN AND. GENERATING MORE TRAIN SEE AN ACE. INCLUDING ADULTS SCHOOLS ALSO WITH LEVERAGE THE STATE'S RECENTLY CREATED ADULT ADD CONSORTIUM PROGRAM WHICH IS INTENDED TO FOSTER COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION. BETWEEN ADULTS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN AND GIVEN REGION'S AND YOU'LL YOU'LL TALK ABOUT ADULT ADD IN THE NEXT ITEM. WITH US RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE MODIFY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING BY INCLUDING ADULTS SCHOOLS IN THE GRANTS RATHER THAN APPROPRIATING FUNDS THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGES STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM THEREFORE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE THE THREAT FUNDS THROUGH THE ADULT. EDUCATION BLOCK GRANT. UNDER THIS APPROACH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WOULD BE CHARGED WITH JOINTLY AWARDING DISTRIBUTING AND OVERSEEN GRANT FUNDS TO ADULT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN EACH CONSORTIUM. TO PROMOTE REGIONAL COORDINATION COMMUNICATION WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED TO BUILD SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO NOTIFY EACH OTHER THAT THEY'RE APPLYING FOR THESE FUNDS SO THEY CAN THEY CAN. TALK MORE IN AND PLAN WHERE YOU PLAN BETTER. SO I SAID EARLIER THERE WERE WE HAD TO. RECOMMENDED MODIFICATIONS THE FIRST DESIGN INCLUDING ADULT SCHOOLS AND THE. IN THE GRANT PROPOSAL THIS SECONDS ARE THE SECOND PROPOSAL CONCERNS CHANGING MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR C. N. A INSTRUCTORS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE NEEDED TO. TEACH A LARGER AND MORE COHORTS OF OF CNA STUDENTS. SO IN THE COURSE OF RESEARCHING AND ANALYZING THE GOVERNOR'S CNA PROPOSAL WE SPOKE WITH A NUMBER OF CNA PROGRAM DIRECTORS BOTH THAT COMMUNICABLE EDGES AN ADULT SCHOOLS. IN GENERALLY THAT DIRECTORS REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE WAIT LISTS OF STEEL OF ELIGIBLE STUDENTS TRYING TO GET INTO A PROGRAM SO. SO IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF. SO YOU REALLY HAVE A POTENTIAL WORKFORCE SUPPLY YOU HAVE THAT THE SUPPLY AT THE READY. TO TO GET INTO THE SLOTS BUT WHAT WE HEARD AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM TALKING WITH THESE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE TRAINING PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND ENROLLMENTS THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE FOR THE MOST PART TO USE THESE. GRANT MONIES ARE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO HER PROVIDE WITHOUT A CHANGE IN THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR INSTRUCTORS WHAT THEY TOLD US AS THE THE THEN THE ANSWER. THEIR QUALIFICATIONS TO BECOME A CNA INSTRUCTOR ARE SO GREAT THAT THEY JUST CAN'T FIND. YEAH INSTRUCTORS TO TEACH THE CLASS EVEN IF THEY'RE THE BAY HAD LOTS OF EXPERIENCE ARE IN THE FIELD. AND THE REASON FOR THIS DISQUALIFICATION ISSUE IS STATE REGULATIONS CURRENT STATE REGULATIONS REQUIRE SEE AN INSTRUCTOR BE A LICENSED NURSE WITH AT LEAST ONE YEAR OF DIRECT CARE EXPERIENCE IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. AND SO THAT'S PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE. YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR ENDS FOR EXAMPLE WHO HAVE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE PROVIDING DIRECT CARE BUT THE DIRECT CARE IS PROVIDED AN ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL NOT IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AS A RESULT. THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE EVEN APPLIED TO BE AN INSTRUCTOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS UNLIKE WHAT OTHER STATES DO. ARE YOU SIMILARLY YOU HAVE NURSES WHO WORK IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. THEY OVERSEE THE C. N. AIDS FOR EXAMPLE. WE'LL THEY WOULDN'T THEY WOULDN'T GET TO BE ELIGIBLE COULD BE CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE TO BE AN INSTRUCTOR EITHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T PROVIDE DIRECT CARE. THE PATIENT IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. SO AND WE LOOKED AT THE. THERE ARE ACTUALLY ARE SOME FEDERAL REGULATIONS ON MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS AND CALIFORNIA'S. SEED THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS JUST TALK ABOUT A NURSES NEED TO HAVE A YEAR OF NURSING OF OF EXPERIENCE IN THE PROVISION OF. OUR LONG TERM CARE FACILITY SERVICES THERE'S NOTHING THERE ABOUT DIRECT CARE. IN THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. SO. WE TALKED TO. ADULT SCHOOLS AS I MENTIONED AND THEY SAID. WELL IN ADDITION TO THE PROBLEM OF FINDING. SEE AN ACE THAT HAVE THAT CNA INSTRUCTORS RATHER THAT HAVE THAT DIRECT CARE EXPERIENCE IN A SNAP. NEW SKILLED NURSING FACILITY THEY HAVE ANOTHER. HURDLE THEY NEED TO FIND AN INSTRUCTOR THAT HAS A. TEACHING CREDENTIAL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THESE INSTRUCTORS HAVE TO HAVE A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION TEACHING CREDENTIAL. SO WHAT% THESE ARE ADULT EDUCATION ADULT SCHOOL PROGRAM DIRECTOR SAID IS THAT IT'S IT'S HARD TO FIND A IS SUCH INDIVIDUALS. AND DIE AS A RESULT THEY FEEL THAT THEY WOULD BE HARD PRESSED. THE CITADEL'S SCHOOLS AS WELL AS A COMMUNICATIVE TO EXPAND ENROLLMENTS. SO A. IN TANDEM WITH PROVIDING GRANTS TO ADULT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES THROUGH WOULD BE A BILL THAT CONSORTIUM WHICH IS OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CHANGE STATUTE TO ALLOW MORE TYPES OF NURSES TO QUALIFY AS SEEN A INSTRUCTORS. SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMEND THE NEW POLICY ALLOW NURSES TO SERVICE INSTRUCTORS IF THEY'VE HAD EXPERIENCE PROVIDING CARE IN AN ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL OR OTHER FACILITY. THAT PROVIDES A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF CARE FOR OLDER ADULTS OR THE CHRONICALLY ILL. AND WE ALSO RECOMMEND PERMITTING AS INSTRUCTORS NURSES WHO DON'T PROVIDE DIRECT CARE AND A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BUT SUPERVISE SEE AN ACE IN MAY OF IN THE PAST HAD DIRECT CARE EXPERIENCE. IN A ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL OR ELSEWHERE. SO THESE CHANGES WOULD MAKE RECRUITING AND HIRING INSTRUCTORS LAST DIFFICULT FOR PROVIDERS WELL CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT INSTRUCTORS MEET FEDERER FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. SO TO HELP ADULTS SCHOOLS IN HIRING INSTRUCTORS AND ALIGN THE REQUIREMENTS WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE AMEND STATUTES. ARE SO THAT INDIVIDUALS NO LONGER NEED A TEACHING CREDENTIAL TO SERVE AS A. CNA INSTRUCTOR IN THE ADULT SCHOOLS. AND WITHOUT SUCH CHANGES TO MINIMUM INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AUGMENTING FUNDING FOR MORE TRAIN SLOTS LIKELY WOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT AND MUCH OF THE GRANT FUNDING WOULD GO UNUSED. THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CHRIS US WONDER THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AGAIN WE THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE PROPOSAL TO USE ONE TIME RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED NEED. TO THE TWO ISSUES THAT THE THAT THE ANALYST. RAISED UP YOU KNOW I THINK ON THE GRANT PROGRAM OF THAT WITH THE FUNDING WE THINK MAKES SENSE WE HAVE THIRTY FIVE COLLEGES CURRENTLY OFFERING OF THESE PROGRAMS. WE DO THINK THAT IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO USE A DIFFERENT. WAY OF DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDING TO OUR COLLEGES THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. BUT YOU KNOW PART OF THE RATIONALE OF THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAMS THAT REGION'S ARE DECIDING UPON NEEDS AND ALLOCATING. STRONG WORKFORCE DOLLARS TO HIGHEST PRIORITIES IF THIS IS A CASE WHERE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE TYPE OF PROGRAM WE'RE TRYING TO SEEK HIM WERE PROVIDING ONCE HAD RESOURCES. IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE YOU KNOW WE THINK TO TO ALLOCATE THESE DOLLARS TO COLLEGES AND I SPENT A MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY. ON THE. ISSUE OF MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS. WE YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN A BROADER SENSE ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STRONG WORKFORCE TASK FORCE TWO YEARS AGO. WAS THAT WE CONSIDER MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR CT INSTRUCTOR SO I THINK WE. YOU KNOW I THINK BE THE PANELISTS POINT MAKES SENSE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO LOOK FOR A LOOK AT AS WE MOVE FORWARD SOMETHING THAT. WE HAVE BEEN DOING WORK INTERNALLY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE THINK ABOUT MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS WE'VE. MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME CHANGES TO MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR APPRENTICESHIP INSTRUCTORS AND I SO I THINK THIS IS HOW. THE CONVERSATION THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH WHERE ARE SYSTEMS BEEN LIVING. THE ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS. THING THAT I KNOW WILL HAVE SOME DISCUSSION. IN THE PUBLIC COMMENTS. P. SO WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL. ISSUE NUMBER THREE ADULT EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING AGAIN CARE MCCARTY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MOLLY COSWORTH WITH FINANCE. BOSTON HOUSE AND FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BE PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW ON THE DOT EDUCATION BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM OR A E. BEACHY WHEN HE PRESENTS LA OWES RECOMMENDATIONS. SO I WON'T GO INTO A LOT OF PROGRAM DETAIL NOW. THE EIGHTY BG PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND% FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WITH DEDICATED ON GOING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION IN WHICH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ENTITIES IN THE SAME REGION WHILE PROVIDING ALL ADULT EDUCATION. WITH LITTLE OR NO COORDINATED PLANNING AS TO WHAT KIND OF SERVICES THEY WERE PROVIDING. AND THE KINDS OF POPULATIONS THEY WERE SERVING. THE AGB PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND REQUIRED ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AN ADULT SCHOOLS. OPERATING IN CAPE WHO TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CONCERT WITH OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS LIBRARIES. TO COME TOGETHER TO FORM REGIONAL CONSORTIA AND JOINTLY DEVELOP THREE YEAR REGIONAL PLANS AS TO HOW BEST TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF THEIR ADULT LEARNERS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES TO THE A. B. G. PROGRAM. FIRST A E. BG CONSORTIA WILL RECEIVE UP FOUR POINT ONE PERCENT COST OF LIVING INCREASE. EQUAL TO TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION ADDED TO THE ON GOING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION. THE PROGRAM HAS RECEIVED NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. AND THIS INCREASE WOULD PROVIDE A ONE POINT FIFTY SIX COLA FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND A TWO POINT FIVE ONE PERCENT COLA IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE COLORS PROVIDED FOR OTHER K. TWELVE INCOMMUNICADO JUST PROGRAMS FOR THESE TWO YEARS. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FUNDING RECOGNIZES THE K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. HAVE FACED HIGHER COSTS TO OPERATE THEIR PROGRAMS INCLUDING HIGHER STEPPING COSTS FOR SALARIES BENEFITS AND EMPLOYERS CONTRA RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS. WE HAVE HEARD FROM A EACH BG PROVIDERS THAT SOME PROGRAMS MAY BE FORCED TO LAY OFF INSTRUCTORS AND OFFER FEWER CLASSES TO ADULT LEARNERS. DUE TO THESE RISING COSTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES AN ON GOING INCREASE OF FIVE MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR TING CONTINUED INVESTMENTS. IN THE EIGHTY BG DATA AND ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THAT THE DATA BEING INPUT BY K. THROUGH TWELVE ADULT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS. ARE ACCURATE COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSISTENT. THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE A BT DATA SHARING PLATFORM. TO CREATE A UNIFIED DATA SET THAT WILL CONTAIN SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF ADULT LEARNERS THINGS ARE BEING SERVED THE EXITS. THE SUCCESS OF THE STUDENTS AS THEY PROGRESS THROUGH THEIR CLASSES AN OUTCOME DATA FOR THE STUDENTS INCLUDING TRANSITION TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. EMPLOYMENT AND WAGE DATA THAT WILL BE PROVIDED THROUGH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. THE COTS THE COMPREHENSIVE STUDENT DATA SET WILL BE PROVIDED WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE LAUNCH BOARD DATA SHARING PLATFORM. THE FUNDING WE HOPE WILL ALSO BE USED TO PROVIDE ONGOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS TO INPUT THEIR DATA CORRECTLY TO ENSURE THAT HIGH QUALITY AND CONSISTENT DATA. IS BEING COLLECTED FROM THE VARIOUS PROVIDERS. SAID THAT THIS DATA CAN BE USED TO INFORM DECISIONS ABOUT PROGRAM EXPANSIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS AND TO CREATE NEW PROGRAM COURSEWORK. SOME OF THE FIVE MILLION WOULD ALSO BE USED TO SURVEY STUDENTS WHO DO NOT PROVIDE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. TO ASK ABOUT THEIR JOB IN PLACE THEIR JOB PLACEMENT AND WAGES. MANY ADULT EDUCATION STUDENTS ENROLLED IN A REGION COURSES DO NOT HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS SO THEY'RE NOT CAPTURED IN DDT'S EMPLOYMENT AND WAGE DATA. THIRDLY. EACH OF THE SEVENTY ONE REGIONAL CONSORTIA ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT DEFINES THE ADULT LEARNER POPULATIONS IN THEIR REGION THE KINDS OF SERVICES AND SUPPORT. THEY NEED AND HOW EACH OF THE CONSORTIUM MEMBERS WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES. UNDER CURRENT STATUTE THE INITIAL PLANNING CYCLE RUNS FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AND COULDN'T SOURCE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING NOW ON DEVELOPING THEIR NEXT PLAN THAT WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE AB BG OFFICE HAS REQUESTED THAT THE CURRENT THREE YEAR PLANNING CYCLE BE EXTENDED FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR THROUGH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. TO GIVE CONSORTIUM PARTNERS AN EXTRA YEAR TO DEVELOP THEIR PLAN AS THEY MOVE FORWARD BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY. WE AGREE THE EXTRA PLANNING YEAR% IS NEEDED SO THE CONSORTIA HAVE ADEQUATE TIME. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DATA SHARING. ACTIVITIES THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED FOR THAT THAT THE FIVE MILLION WOULD PROVIDE. AND IT WOULDN'T THEY WOULD HAVE BETTER DATA TO ALIGN THEIR PROGRAMS TO WE JUST THINK THERE ARE THERE PLANS BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WOULD BE BASED ON MUCH BETTER DATA SO WE AGREE THAT. THEY'D. IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH ANOTHER GEAR. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REVISE THE EXISTING AND TIMELINES. AND FOURTH THEM WE'RE PROPOSING TO CHANGE THE EDUCATION TRAILER BILL FOR THAT TRAILER BILL FOR EDUCATION. TO CAP THE INDIRECT COST RATE THAT HOME. COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND K. THROUGH TWELVE CHARGE THEIR ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS. WE WOULD CAP THIS AT NO MORE THAN THE INDIRECT COST RATE THAT WAS CHARGED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OR AT NO MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE I. EACH CONSORTIUMS THEM TOTAL THE EPG ALLOCATION. AND WE'VE HEARD THAT SOME ADULTS SCHOOLS ARE BEING CHARGED TEN PERCENT OR GREATER IN THEIR INTEREST COST RATE. SO THAT ENHANCE MY COMMENTS ON THIS PROGRAM AND I'M. HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY. OUR OFFICE WAS CHARGED WITH. IDENTIFYING UNRESOLVED ALIGNMENT IN COORDINATION ISSUES. THAT. THEY CONTINUE TO IMPEDE THE ABILITY OF ADULT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO WORK TOGETHER IN A COORDINATED WAY AND TO SERVE STUDENTS IN A WAY. THAT PROVIDES RELATIVELY EQUAL ACCESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ADULT LEARNERS AND ACCESS TO QUALITY SERVICES SO SOMETHING. WE DID IN YOUR. YOUR AGENDA INCLUDES A SUMMARY TABLE. ON PAGE TEN. OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED. THIS SERGEANT ACTUALLY USED THIS IS WELL AS THIS DISTRIBUTED A. THAT TABLE. WHICH MIGHT BE EASIER FOR YOU TO READ. AND SO. ALL GO THROUGH A KIND OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF OF THAT. TABLE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. AND THEN BASED ON. WHAT WE WHAT WE OUTLINED HERE THINK IT'LL HELP? BETTER HELP YOU. A BETTER UNDERSTAND. AND BE BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON THE AUGMENTATION. AND THAT FOUR POINT ONE PERCENT AUGMENTATION AND THEN THE DATA. ISSUES. SO JUST TO START. ON THE TOP ROW OF THAT TABLE. I NOTES THAT STUDENT IDENTIFIERS REMAIN AN UNRESOLVED ISSUE. CURRENTLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES USE. STUDENTS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER. STUDENT DOESN'T HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND THEY USE THAT FOR TO PUT IT INTO THEIR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM. AND TO FOLLOW STUDENTS AND SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING LOOK AT OUTCOMES. K. TWELVE THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM HAS A STATEWIDE STUDENT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE IDENTIFIER FOR EACH STUDENT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. BUT THEN WHAT'S THAT STUDENT THE STUDENT WERE TO LEAVE OR LET'S SAY DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL RETURN AS ADULT STUDENTS. GENERALLY ADULT SCHOOLS WOULD GIVE THAT STUDENT A LOCAL IDENTIFIER NOT THAT OLD STATEWIDE STUDENT IDENTIFIER GENERALLY ALSO. IF YOU HAVE A STUDENT IT'S NOT FROM THAT DIDN'T GO TO K. TWELVE CASE GO THROUGH K. TWELVE IN CALIFORNIA THEY'LL GET. A LOCAL IDENTIFIER AS WELL. AND AGAIN THESE IDENTIFIERS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE WHAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE SO YOU HAVE IS A SYSTEM. THAT. DOES NOT MAKE IT VERY EASY FOR THE PROVIDERS. AND FOR CHANCES OFFICE AND CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION NO LEGISLATURE FOR THAT MATTER. TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE STUDENTS ARE DOING TO FOLLOW THEM FROM THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. TWO ADULT EDUCATION. TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES MAYBE TO UNIVERSITY OF WORKFORCE AND SO THAT THAT'S OF A BIG ISSUE AND WE RECOMMEND THAT ADULT SCHOOL START USING STATEWIDE STUDENT IDENTIFIERS. AND IF THE IT THAT THAT A BILL THAT STUDENT WAS ONCE IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM TO GET THAT THAT NUMBER BACK NUMBER THEN WE REQUIRE THAT. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE ADULT SCHOOLS SHARE THOSE STATEWIDE IDENTIFIERS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PRETTY MANY COLLEGES. TO. INCORPORATE IDENTIFIERS IN THEIR DATA SYSTEM SEC THAT'S ONE ISSUE IN IN THE SO COME BACK YOU WILL COME BACK TO THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSALS ON DATA. I WILL NOT GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE BUT THE HIGHLIGHT THE MAJOR ONES AS FAR AS A LINEMAN ISSUES A BIG ONE IS STATE FUNDING. AND COURSE FEES RIGHT NOW. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS VERY DIFFERENT FUNDING POLICIES AND FEE POLICIES DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S. AN ADULT SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RELY PRIMARILY ON A PORTION MINUTES FOR ADULT ADD. INSTRUCTION. WHICH THEY CALL NON CREDIT AND THERE'S A SET S. STATUTORILY STACKED SET. UP PER STUDENT RATE. NOW DOLE SCHOOLS GET THEIR MONEY. THROUGH IT ALL THAT BLOCK GRANTS THAT'S THEIR STATE MONEY AND THERE IS NO SET PER STUDENT RATE. I IT'S UP TO EACH INDIVIDUAL% ADULT SCHOOL TO DECIDE WHAT. WHAT THEY WANT TO FIND AND AND HOW RICH LEAD TO FIND A INSTRUCTION? AND WE KNOW FROM SPEAKING WITH ADULTS SCHOOLS THAT FUNDING PER STUDENT VARIES QUITE A BIT FROM AREA TO AREA FROM ADULT SCHOOL THEY DON'T ADULT SCHOOL. NOW FOR A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION CT COURSES MANY ADULT SCHOOLS ARE FORCED TO SUPPLEMENT STATE FINDING THAT BLOCK GRANT FUNDING WITH FEES. AND YOU SEE YOU GREAT VARIATION AROUND THE STATE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ADULT LEARNERS ARE CHARGED FOR COMPARABLE. INSTRUCTION FOR COMPARABLE PROGRAMS WE JUST HAD THE ISSUE ON CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS. IF YOU GO TO A Q. IF IF AN ADULT LEARNER WHERE TO GO TO AN ADULT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THEY WOULD NOT BE CHARGED. A FEE. TO GO TO THAT SEE IN A TRAINING PROGRAM. OR IF THERE WAS SOME SORT OF FEE THAT STUDENT ALMOST ALWAYS WHICH WOULD GET A STATE. FUNDED FEE WAIVER THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY. IT'S NOT THE CASE WITH ADULTS SCHOOLS WE LOOK AT ADULTS SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SOME CHARGE UP TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A SEMESTER LIKE PROGRAM NOT BECAUSE THEY. LIKE TO NOT SO THEY WANT TO DO IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR THE BLOCK GRANT THAT WOULD SUPPORT THAT INSTRUCTION THEY IN ORDER TO OFFER THAT. THAT COURSE THAT PROGRAM THEY CHARGE FEES SO JUST DEPENDING ON WHERE AN ADULT LEARNER. LIVES THEY'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE FEES THEY PAY. SO. THESE ARE THESE ARE SOME BIG ISSUES YOU KNOW FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO TO TACKLE AND. IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT MIGHT TAKE A FEW MORE YEARS. TO TO REALLY IMPLEMENT YOU DECIDE AND AND TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES HOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE CREATE A BETTER ACCESS AND A MORE COMPARABLE. A. LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS AROUND THE STATE. LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO START WITH SOME MORE MODEST. A UNRESOLVED ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED FOR EXAMPLE IN THE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE YOU SEE OF THE ISSUE OF COORDINATION WITH OTHER ADULT EDUCATION. FUNDS CURRENTLY YOU HAVE A STATE A OF LIBRARIES AND OTHER. ORGANIZATIONS THAT RECEIVE STATE FUNDING FOR FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ADULT EDUCATION. BUT CURRENTLY THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR LOCAL CONSORTIA NOT AT THE TABLE NOT PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOT COORDINATING NOT CREATING. LADDERS FOR FOR STUDENTS AND PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS. TO TO ADVANCE. IN THEIR LEARNING EXPERIENCE. A RELATIVELY SIMPLE RECOMMENDATION OF OURS IS TO REQUIRE ALL OF THESE ADULT AT PROVIDERS TO BE PART OF THEIR REGIONAL CONSORTIA. AND FOR THE REGIONAL CONSORTIA INTERN TO. TO WELCOME THEM YOU KNOW AT THE TABLE AND INCLUDE ARE ALL OF THESE PROVIDERS IN THE PLANS OF WHATTHEY'RE FINDING AND AND HOW THEY'RE CREATING BETTER PROGRAMS. FOR STUDENTS. ANOTHER ISSUE SECOND FROM BOTTOM OF BOTTOM ROW IS MINIMUM INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I I MENTIONED IN THE. EARLIER ITEM ON CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS. RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE. ADULT SCHOOLS AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES TEACHING THE SAME OR SIMILAR CONTENT YET STATE HAS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR WHAT. IT'S TEACHER NEEDS TO HAVE IN ORDER TO TEACH IN THOSE PROGRAMS. AND IF THE IF THE INSTRUCTORS TEACHING AN ADULT SCHOOL THEY NEED TO HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL WHEREAS IF THEY'RE TEACHING THAT COMMITTEE COLLEGES THEY DO NOT NEED TO DO TEACHING CREDENTIAL. SIZE RESULT COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTORS. WITHOUT A TEACHING CREDENTIAL SO WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE DROP THAT A CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENT FOR ADULTS EDUCATIVO INSTRUCTORS. ARE NOT JUST FOR C. N. A.'S BUT BUT FOR OTHER. INSTRUCTIONAL AREAS AS WELL. SO WE GET TO THE GOVERNOR SPECIFIC FUNDING PROPOSALS. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN AUGMENTATIONS FOR THE BLOCK GRANT. GIVEN WHAT I JUST MENTIONED IT'S HARD TO KNOW IF THIS IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OR NOT. A ENROLLMENT YOU WITH WITH K. TWELVE IT'S MEASURED IN TERMS OF AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE EIGHTY A. AND YOU KNOW. FROM FOR COMMUNICABLE EDGES AND UNIVERSITIES YET FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS F. T. E. S. WHICH IS A MEASURE OF. OF ENROLLMENT OF OF WORKLOAD. WE DON'T KNOW CURRENTLY HOW MANY FTA EASE ARE BEING SERVED. BY THESE CONSORTIA IN THE STATE WE WE HAVE HEAD COUNT BUT WE DON'T HAVE. WE DON'T HAVE EIGHTY A RAFTER E. OR SOMETHING EQUIVALENT. AND SO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WHETHER FD * GROWING NO WORDS IT FLAT OR IS IT IS IT GOING DOWN WE JUST DON'T KNOW. WE LACK OTHER IMPORTANT INFO I DATA THAT LEGISLATURE DOES TO HELP SET OVERALL THE OVERALL BLOCK GRANT FUNDING LEVEL WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF UNMET NEED IN THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE OR. HOW MUCH PROVIDERS ARE SPENDING PER STUDENT? US SO. THESE ARE SOME CONSIDERATION THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW WHAT IS GIVEN A LACK OF DATA WHAT IS THE RIGHT LEVEL TO SET. THAT'S SAID PROVIDING AUGMENTATION ALONG THE LINES OF THE FOUR POINT ONE PERCENT AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IT WOULD TREAT THE DAHLE THAT BLOCK AROUND. BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM SIMILAR TO A LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA COMMITTEE COLLEGE APPORTIONMENT SIN AND SOME OTHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AND IN THOSE CASES THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED AUGMENTATION A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE AYE DATA THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR DATA RELATED OF PROJECTS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THAT FUNDING. PROPOSAL ARE IT WOULD REALLY HELP THE LEGISLATURE GET MORE ACCURATE AND MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF PROGRAM OUTCOMES AND IN BETTER MONITOR. HOW THE AT ALL THAT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM IS PROGRESSING? WE DO RECOMMEND IT ALONG WITH THAT PROPOSAL HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO USE A PORTION OF THOSE FINES TO ASSIGN US STATEWIDE STUDENT IDENTIFIER. TO ADULT STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE THAT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND THEN FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO. YOU COLLECTED MAINTAIN THOSE IDENTIFIERS IN THE DATA SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY BUILDING. AND WE THINK THAT THAT. KIND OF APPROACH WOULD ALLOW THE STATE AND PROVIDERS TO BETTER ASSESS HOW STUDENTS ARE MOVING FROM K. TWELVE. TO ADULT SCHOOLS TO COMMUNICATIVE ISN'T AND INTO THE WORKFORCE. THANK YOU. OKAY. GOOD MORNING DEBORAH VENABLE HAVE A STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM PARKS AND. I JUST KNOW TO COUPLE THINGS ONE IS THAT THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE AT A COST OF LIVING INCREASE FOR I'M. FEDERAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR THE REASONS MATH QUIZ BY TH NOTED WHICH IS THAT THEY'VE SEEN RISING COSTS BUT. UP FLAT FUNDING I'M ADDITIONAL I'M ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE END OF YOUR REPORT ON IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ADULT ED. EDUCATION BLOCK GRANT REPORT FOR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN I I WILL NOTE THAT THAT THE. REPORT IS BEING FINALIZED NOW ACT OF FIGHT NEAR FINAL DRAFT WAS PROVIDED TO THE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT DID HAVE THAT THE DRAFT FOR AWHILE WHEN WE REVIEWED IT. FIRST WE HAD SOME. DATA ISSUES I NEED TO DO SOME BACK AND FORTH WITH THE CONTRACTOR AND THAT TOOK LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED AND JUST JUST TO SAY. THAT WE HAD INTENDED TO BE THAT LONG WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAINST THAT WE DO MEET THAT. THE TIMELINE ON THE REPORT BUT THAT SHOULD BE FINALIZED VERY SOON. AND SO IN THAT REPORT THOUGH THERE COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE JUST. HIGHLIGHT ON NOT SO THE REPORT ADDRESSES THE KEY REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATION AND PROVIDE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS IT INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE STATE LEVEL DATA. ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT OUTCOME SKILLS GAINED STUDENTS THAT STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND OTHER DATA USING THE AT NEW ADULT EDUCATION DATA AND ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS THAT WE SEE THE CONSORTIA HAS SERVED. JUST OVER SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND I'M. AS ADULTS IN THE PROGRAM'S ABOUT SIXTY SIX PERCENT OF THOSE WERE IN K. TWELVE ADULT SCHOOLS. I'M OF THOSE SHOULD JUST SHY OF SIX HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND MORE WERE ENROLLED IN ONE OF THE SEVEN EBT PROGRAM AREAS. AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM RECEIVE SERVICES INSTEAD INCLUDING PARTICIPATING IN WORKSHOPS. EDUCATIONAL CAREER PLANNING ASSESSMENT BUT DIDN'T ACTUALLY ENROLL IN A PROGRAM IT'S AS WE LOOK AT THOSE THE SEVEN PROGRAMS THE REPORT OUTLINES THAT THE INVOLVEMENT FOR THOSE. I AM ON THE DATA WE DO IF WE LOOK BACK AT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THE ADULTS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM'S COMPLETED A MEASURABLE SKILL GAIN. WHEN EDUCATION MILESTONES WE SAW SIXTEEN THOUSAND AND ADULT COMPLETING A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT AND NOT JUST SHY OF ELEVEN THOUSAND RECEIVINGPOST SECONDARY CERTIFICATES OR DEGREES AND TRAININGS. AND THEN AT I'D JUST ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND TRANSITIONING TO POST SECONDARY WILL ALSO THE REPORT ALSO OUTLET SOME SOME WAGE DATA SO I AM. ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND ADULTS AND ENTERED THE EMPLOYMENT AND ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND TO INCREASE WAGES AND TO THE REPORT PROVIDES MORE DETAIL. ON THAT. AS FAR AS RECOMMENDATIONS GO SO THAT I IN THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT THEY CREATE THAT AND THE LEGISLATURE CREATE A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR PERFORMANCE BASED INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR ADULT EDUCATION CONSORTIA. AND THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT THAT AND THAT BE ALLOCATED. TO ADMINISTER AND AN INCENTIVE FUND WILL ALSO RECOMMEND ALLOCATING ANNUAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT DATE AND ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS FOR ADULT EDUCATION. CREATING A DEDICATED ANNUAL ALLOCATION FOR STATEWIDE SYSTEMS OF OPERATION FOR ADULT EDUCATION AND ALIGN THE FEDERAL AND STATE REPORTING CYCLES AND WITHOUT ALTERNATIVE AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BUTJUST TO KNOW THAT I'M AVAILABLE AND ALSO. DONNA WHITE WHO IS OUR DIRECTOR OF THAT CAREER IN COLLEGE TRANSITION DIVISION ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU KRISHNASWAMY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND WE APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENTS. PARTNERSHIP ON THIS WORK. ON THE. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL WE THINK THE FOUR POINT ONE PERCENT INCREASE MAKES SENSE WE ARE ESPECIALLY. WITH. SUPPORTIVE OF THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DATA WORK OF OUR DATA MORE BROADLY THE ANALYST SUSPENSION AND. CHALLENGES WITH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS I WILL JUST NOTE. ONE BILL AB TWENTY SIXTY. TWENTY SIX SIXTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. SEEKS TO IMPROVE DATA LINKAGES BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING THE DAM PM EDT TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OUTCOMES FOR CT PROGRAMS GENERALLY INCLUDING ADULT EDUCATION. ON THE FUNDING ISSUE I DO YOU JUST WANT TO POINT OUT YOU KNOW I THINK OF. YOU KNOW THE THE ANALYSTS POINT IS THAT. ACROSS THE STATE WE MIGHT SEE DATA AND WE DO SEE DIFFERENT PER STUDENT FUNDING RATES OF. ACROSS THESE PROGRAMS BUT YOU KNOW I THINK WE TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH I THINK YOU KNOW THE. THE PHILOSOPHY OF THIS PROGRAM. YEAH I THINK IT HAS THREE GOALS ONE TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO. ADULT ED PROGRAMS THE SECOND IS PROBABLY TO IMPROVE QUALITY BY LEAVING DECISIONS UP TO THE LOCAL CONSORTIA TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ARE THE. MOST APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS TO. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. FUNDING TWO AND THREE TO BUILD YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK OF IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS GUIDED PATHWAYS THAT WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO. THROUGH THE CONSORTIA YOU LIKELY HAVE IMPROVED TRANSITIONS FROM AND ACROSS ADULT SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY. OF MUCH OF THE INITIAL WORK ON WHETHER WE'RE ACHIEVING THAT IS. IS IN OUR DRAFT REPORT WHICH THE. YOUR AGENDA SUMMARIZES. BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT HOW WE GET MONEY FROM THE STATE TO BE CONSORTIA THAT WE HAVE A FORMULA IT'S NOT ENROLLMENT SURE OF AND THAT WE HAVE A FORMULA THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SIZE OF THE ADULT POPULATION. SCOTT MET MEASURES AROUND LITERACY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IMMIGRANT AND IMMIGRATION. AND THAT WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CONSORTIUM SIZING CAPACITY SO. I DID IT I THINK WERE HAPPIER THAT I KIND OF HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THESE PER STUDENT FUNDING RATES ARE AT THE CONSORTIA SPENDING RATES. BUT I DO THINK WE THINK IT. A FORMULA FROM THE STATE LEVEL OUGHT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THINGS OTHER THAN. ENROLLMENT AT THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT NEED I THINK YOU CAN DO BOTH BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW YOU DO THAT. ARMED WITH REGARD AGAIN ON MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED AS PART OF OUR SYSTEM. AND ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. TO THINK HOW WE DO THAT. TAKE QUESTIONS. YEAH BUT. QUESTION AUTUMN BUT FIRST MR CHAVIS. WELL THIS REPORT REFLECTS. PROBABLY THE GUIDANCE THAT WE ESTABLISH BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. WHEN WE. WELL THE PROPOSAL BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS TO. DEFUND ADULT EDUCATION AND. AND EVERY WAS LIKE UP AT ARMS BACK AT TWELVE THIRTEEN I REMEMBER. IT WAS MY FIRST SESSION BEING HERE SO. WE WENT PUSH BACK ON THAT AND WE ASK FOR HISTORICAL PRESENTATION AND. WAS INTERESTING ONE OF THE FIRST EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION WE HAD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BAKKEN. FORMATION OF THIS. STATE NINETEEN SIXTY WAS ADULT EDUCATION FOR LITERACY. AND FOR CITIZENSHIP. AND SO FOUND OUT IT HAD A WHOLE HISTORY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE AND WHERE WE'RE GOING. AND. SO WE ASKED HIM TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT. HOW WE COULD? RECOGNIZE UNIQUENESS OF A RURAL AREA IN AN URBAN AREA AND WHO IS DOING THIS TO HIGH SCHOOLS. OR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO DETERMINE THAT BACK AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION TWELVE THIRTEEN. THERE WAS THE INTRODUCTION THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING AND HAVING PEOPLE LOCALLY BEST MAKE THE DECISIONS IT WASN'T DECIDED AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO THIS KIND OF FOLLOWED IN WITH THAT WHOLE DISCUSSION. SO WE WE PUNTED DOWN TO LOCAL PEOPLE YOU CONSORTIUM AND I TEND A NUMBER OF MEETINGS IN MY OWN DISTRICT. AND I CAN SAY IN WHAT ONE PORTION MY DISTRICT IT WAS RUN BY COMMUNITY COLLEGE YEARS AND THE OTHER ONE IS RUN BY HIGH SCHOOLS. AND THAT WAS INTEREST IN SEEING THE DISCUSSION COME OUT OTHERS THE THINGS THAT THEY ARGUED ABOUT BACK THEN AND I THINK THE LA OKAY DRAWN AGAIN. WAS THE A FUNDING MODEL. YOU NO HOT. WHO'S GOING TO GET THE MONEY WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR IT. THOUGH WHAT DEFINED IN EXTRACTOR. YOU KNOW. WHERE THEY COME FROM WHAT WERE THE QUALIFICATIONS? AND ALSO THE DATA FAR HOW REALLY DEFY THEM TO FIGURE OUT THE GOING ONS OF. EVERYTHING THE LA. LAID OUT HERE WITH SOME OF THE SAME DISCUSSIONS AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE DOING ON THE SET UP THE CONSORTIUM'S. SO FAST FORWARD NOW A FEW YEARS LATER. A. COULD YOU QUICKLY MISS BROWN BOTH USE THE SUCCESSES. OF ADULT EDUCATION YOU HAD HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCREASE THEIR WAGES HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW GOT CERTIFICATES YOU TO GIVE GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED AGAIN GOING TO TAKE NOTES ON THIS GOING TO USE IT LATER BY AND I'M HAPPY TO TO PROVIDE WE PROVIDED THE REPORT BUT I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU IN AND THE NUMBERS BUT BUT WHAT I AM. RECOUNTED IS IF WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF ADULTS BEING SERVED BY THE PROGRAMS WE SEE. AT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND ADULTS BEING SERVED IN THE PROGRAM AND WE DO HAVE A BREAKDOWN WHICH AGAIN I CAN PROVIDE FOR YOU. AROUND THE AROUND THAT BY THE PROGRAM AREA AT THAT FOR US THE SUCCESSES AS WE LOOK AT IF WE SEE THE NUMBER WHO HAVE. COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS THAT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND. AND THE NUMBER WHO HAVE A POST SECONDARY CERTIFICATES DEGREES ARE TRAINING IS AYE TEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THEN THAT THE TRANSITION TO POST SECONDARY IS TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED. AND THEN IF WE SEE THE INCREASED M. ARE AT HAVE ENTERED EMPLOYMENT THAT IS SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND THEN INCREASE WAGES THE SIXTEEN THOUSAND. EIGHT HUNDRED AND I GET I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOU THOSE SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT'S GREAT SO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT SIXTEEN THOUSAND LIVES. GREASE WAGES THAT'S FAMILIES WERE TAKING CARE OF. IN A SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND EMPLOYMENT I MEAN. THIS IS REALLY GOOD STUFF FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE PUTTING IN HERE FOR THE STATE. SO. THE REQUEST I THINK WAS I HEARD FROM THE FARM FINANCES BEEN ANOTHER YEAR ON THE CONSORTIUM'S ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD I GET THAT RIGHT. PROBABLY DANCE. ANOTHER PLAN YOU'RE PROBABLY ANSWER THE QUESTION THE LA O.. I WISH I'D BEEN HERE TO. SHE IS COMING OUT NEXT YEAR BUT I'M BE ROLE BUT THE. I THINK THE. SAME AS A PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOR THE NURSES AND THIS ONE HERE. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD BILL IDEAS IN. ACTUALLY TO BRING FORWARD TO CHANGE BECAUSE WE'RE POP WHERE BUDGET COMMITTEE HERE WE'RE NOT A POLICY. WE HAVE ONE BIG BUILDING IN THE AIR. BY A BILL YET BUT HAVE NOT YET RATE PRIVATELY HELD IT ALL UP IN THE ONE BILL YEAH YOU AND I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR A COUPLE YEARS TOGETHER. AS I THINK I WOULD FIND INTERESTING THIS COMMITTEE. GOES THROUGH UNANIMOUSLY BOTH AND REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT OUT OF ALL THE BUDGET COMMITTEES COULD I THINK OF THE WORK WE DO. BUT THE. THIS IS GOOD STUFF AND SO AYE WOOD DESK SUPPORTING CREED INCREASING YEAR I THINK I WOULD ALSO SAY THE LA L. HAS MADE SOME REALLY GOOD ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED SOME YEARS AGO. AND THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DISCUSSING LOCALLY IN THE CONSORTIUM'S WHEN I GO ATTEND TO LISTEN TO WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTED THESE CHANGES FOR THE GOVERNOR. PUSH MY* IS TO DO THIS. I THINK THIS IS A. A LOT OF SUCCESSES LAYER BODY CAN TIE ONTO SO THANK. EVERYBODY HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS IS BEEN AN INTERESTING DEAL WITH STILL GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO I THINK HE LA ALWAYS GIVES A GREAT ROAD MAP SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK TO. OKAY. WHAT ALL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AT FIRST I I I APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS HERE AND? MAYBE WE'LL HEAR LATER ON FROM THE ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATION BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE FIELD BUT THEY THINK ABOUT THIS MAY BE THE. SOME OF THE EDUCATION GROUPS TO YOU AS FAR AS THAT THE CREDENTIAL ELEMENT AS WELL SO I THINK THEY'RE WORTHY OF DISCUSSION WILL CERTAINLY. EVALUATE THEM. THAT I I MET CURIOUS ABOUT THE. THE ELIMINATING THE FEES THAT'S INTRIGUING TO ME AND JUST WONDER IF THERE'S A AT. AND ALSO AS FAR AS HOW MUCH THAT WOULD COST. SHOULD WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE ACTUALLY. DID DIE AN ESTIMATE. I. I CAN. FIND WRONG I CAN GET BACK TO BUT IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE FORTY TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ARE CURRENTLY. COLLECTED IN FEES FOR CT PROGRAMS SO IF IF. IF THERE IS NO LONGER A CHARGE. FOR THOSE YOU ORDER THE GOLD THAT HE'S A SKIT ISSUES ME SO I DON'T ADD CT  <u><c.green>GOTCHA YET</c></u> YEAH IDOL THAT CITY THERE'S COULDN'T CURRENTLY THE STATE DOES NOT. ALLOW ADULT SCHOOLS TO CHARGE YES STUDENTS FOR ANY SL INABILITY THAT GETS RIGHT. SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER IS NOT A TIENEN THOUGH TOTALITY OF THE WHOLE CLUB PROGRAM. MAYBE THAT'S AN IMPEDIMENT MAYBE IT'S NOT. AMOUNT SO INTERESTED ON THE WHOLE NOTION WITH. INFORMATION IDENTIFIERS AND CERTAINLY WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS AND SO I'M WONDERING HOW THAT'S WORKING NOW ESPECIALLY. WE'VE HEARD LAST YEAR WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES LESS LIKELY TO GIVE INFORMATION SELF. PACK DOT CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BUT THE OVERALL THING LA AS MR CHÃ¡VEZ. YOU KNOW ALLUDED TO ADULT THAT'S A GREAT PROGRAM A BIG SUPPORTER I'D. LITERALLY PARTICIPATE IN IT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TO GET MY. I SCHOOL DIPLOMA SELDON HAVE SOUGHT FIRST HAND I'M I I DID NOTE THAT. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT WE WE ARE APPROPRIATION BEFORE THE RECESSION WAS WAS HIGHER IT WAS SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT YEAH YEAH SO WE'RE BACK OUT OF OUR LIVES HUNDRED AND SO I THINK THAT'S BEEN A BIG RELIEF AND. AND I I AM STILL WONDERING IF THERE'S IF WHAT THE. THE DEMAND IS OUT THERE IF WE ARE. FILLING ALL THE NEEDS AND I KNOW WE HAVE THAT THE THE COLA IN HERE BUT IS THAT ENOUGH. SO I WANT TO CONTINUE TO ASK THAT CAN PASS THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR HER OTHER STATE TO COME BACK AND TELL US IF THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OR IF WE NEED TO LOOK ABOUT. I'VE GOING GREATER AND AND ALSO JUST BACK TO THAT TO THE BENEFIT OF ADULT THAT. YOU KNOW SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T ALWAYS QUANTIFY LET'S SAY SOMEBODY GOES FROM A. THIRD GRADE READING LEVEL TO A SEVENTH GRADE IS THAT A CERTIFICATE. NOW. BUT IS IT A TREMENDOUS UPSIDE IN IT AND THE SUCCESS HELPING. PEOPLE I GET BETTER SKILLS TO BE A THAT YOU KNOW MORE EFFECTIVE. CITIZEN IN CALIFORNIA WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO HELP IN THEIR KIDS WITH THEIR HOMEWORK IN SCHOOL. WITH EMPLOYMENT SO. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THE NUMBERS AS FAR AS. HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS AND AND AND AND JOBS AND AND. MOVING ON OUR PART AS WELL BUT THE OVERALL. THAT MEANING OF ADULT ED IN CALIFORNIA IS SO MUCH GREATER AND SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD LOSE. A FOCUS ON THAT AT AS WELL. BUT THAT THAT'S ALL FOR NOW. ANY. FURTHER QUESTIONS. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE I KNOW WILL HAVE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS AND A BIT. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AND I WILL NOTE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE THE AGENDA LONG AND WE DID HAVE A. TWO THREE HOURS HEARING ON THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON. THE TV AND. ED CAN MAYBE A FEW MONTHS AGO AS WELL SO WHAT WE DID GO OVER A LITTLE BIT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED OF THE WANTS HIM. AND REVISIT IT TODAY AS WELL. WE'LL START WITH. PARTMINER FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'M GOING TO BEGIN MY OVERVIEW OF THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROPOSAL. BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO POINT NINE BILLION TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT IS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION FROM THE REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL CENTERS PROGRAM WHICH WAS ROLLED INTO THE LC FF FACE WHEN IT WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. IN ADDITION AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO TWO POINT SIX PERCENT OF THE LC EFFECT BASED GRANT IS PROVIDED THROUGH THE NINE FOR TWELFTH RATES BEEN ADJUSTMENT. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHER COST OF PROVIDING CT PROGRAMS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. ASSUMING FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS BASE CREDIT JUST MET WILL AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION IN ONGOING FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN BUILT IN. TO THE LC FF BASE THAT CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT ROBUST CTE PROGRAMS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE LOCAL PRIORITY. FUNDING ALLOCATED THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA SHOULD PAY FOR A FULL RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL COSTS INCLUDING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. HOWEVER AND RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT HIGH QUALITY CTE PROGRAMS PLAY A VALUABLE ROLE IN PREPARING STUDENTS TO MEET THE STATE LABOR MARKET DEMANDS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION AN ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO ESTABLISH A K. TWELVE SPECIFIC COMPONENT WITHIN THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. THIS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO INCENTIVIZE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO OFFER HIGH QUALITY CT PROGRAMS. THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH NEEDED INDUSTRY SKILLS AND REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OCCURRING THROUGH THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. FUNDING IS PROVIDED THROUGHT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO WILL THEN ALLOCATE THE FUNDING TO THE EIGHT EXISTING STRONG WORKFORCE REGIONAL CONSORTIA. BASED ON A FORMULA THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE REGION'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. PROJECTED JOB OPENINGS AND SEVEN FOR TWELVE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS WITH GRANT DETERMINATIONS BEING MADE BY A COMMITTEE OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS IN EACH REGION. SIMILAR TO THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM THE FUNDING ALLOCATED TO EACH CONSORTIUM WILL BE SEPARATED INTO THREE POTS FOR SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE APPLICANTS BASED ON THEIR AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING APPLICANTS MUST BE A MEMBER OF THE CONSORTIUM AND BE PARTICIPATING IN THE REGIONAL EFFORTS TO LINE WORKFORCE EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION SERVICES. THEY MUST UTILIZE THE REGION'S PLAN TO INFORM THEIR EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT OR EXPAND UPON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION COURSES THAT THEY ARE OFFERING. THE MUST PROVIDE A LOCAL MATCH FOR ANY FUNDING RECEIVED FROM THE PROGRAM. AND THEY MUST MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE LIFTED FROM THE EXISTING CITY INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES TWELVE MILLION AND ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TO PUT IN PLACE A REGIONAL LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE TO ASSESS TEACHERS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS IN IMPLEMENTING HIGH QUALITY C. T. PROGRAMS. NOW THAT I PREFER COVERED WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS I'D LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MISINFORMATION THAT HAS COME UP IN CONVERSATION SO WE PACKED WITH STAKEHOLDERS. FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROCESS FUNDING TO THE REGIONAL CONSORTIUMS THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE LINE ITEM. THE PROPOSAL IS TO FIND A NICE WAY TO UTILIZE THE EXISTING STRUCTURE INCLUDING THE EXISTING FISCAL AGENTS. VETERAN PLACE FOR THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. IT IS NOT STRUCTURED THIS WAY TO SIGNAL THAT THE K. TWELVE COMPONENT OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM. NOR WILL COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BE ABLE TO ACT ALLOCATE BURKE THE ABLE TO RECEIVE ANY OF THE FUNDING ALLOCATED FOR THE PROGRAM. SECONDLY WE'VE HEARD OUR PROPOSAL CHARACTERIZED AS A SHIFT OF K. TWELVE CT TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THIS IS AN ACCURATE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. BUT THE T. INFANT OF GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EXPIRES AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE A SHORT TERM TRANSITION PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO INVEST IN CT. DURING THE FACE SOME OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALWAYS MATCHES THE PROGRAM AS SUCH. THE GOVERNOR IS NOT SHIFTING ADMINISTRATION OF THIS PROGRAM TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES. RATHER THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO ESTABLISH A NEW PROGRAM THAT'S NARROWLY TAILORED TO INCENTIVIZE ELEAZAR TO IMPLEMENT OR EXPAND UPON REGIONALLY ALIGNED. CD PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ADMINISTER AN OVERSEE SEVERAL K. TWELVE CD PROGRAMS. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES AGRICULTURAL INCENTIVE GRANTS SPECIALIZED SECONDARY PROGRAMS IN THE CITY PATHWAYS PROGRAM. THIRD WE'VE HEARD THAT THE WORKFORCE PATHWAY COORDINATORS HAVE BEEN LABELED AS COMMUNITY COLLEGES EMPLOYEES. THE REFERENCE AND TRAILER BILL TO ESTABLISHING ONE PER COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WAS FOR GEOGRAPHIC PURPOSES ONLY. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WOULD APPLY TO SERVE IN THIS CAPACITY. INDUSTRY PARTNERS COULD ALSO SERVE AS FOR ALL TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE PARTNERING WITH THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY. ULTIMATELY IT'S THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHO'LL BE THE ONE SELECTING THE INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE IN THIS FOR ALL. IN ADDITION SOME HAVE THOUGHT THAT ALL SEVENTY TWO WORKFORCE PATHWAY COORDINATORS WOULD BE BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THESE INDIVIDUALS WE PLACED OUT IN THE FIELD ENSURING THAT THERE ACCESSIBLE TO ELOISE AND THEIR SERVICE AREA. FINALLY WE'VE HEARD CONCERN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUS ON INDUSTRY ALIGNMENT. MEANS THAT CITY PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. FOR IT THROUGH THE PROPOSAL WOULD NOT BE ALIGNED TO CT STANDARDS OR WOULD BE COMPLETELY VOID OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAREER ENGAGEMENT IT CAREER EXPLORATION. WE AGREE THAT STUDENT ENGAGEMENT A CAREER EXPLORATION ARE WORTH YOU SEE T. EQUALS WHICH IS WHY THE MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS. CALLED OUT IN THE PROPOSAL'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRE THAT APPLICANTS FOR THEIR SAFETY PROGRAMS OFFER HIGH QUALITY CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION. ALIGNED WITH THE CALIFORNIA CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION MODEL CURRICULUM STANDARDS. PROVIDE PEOPLE'S WITH QUALITY CAREER EXPLORATION GUIDANCE. AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN INTER CHECKS COMPETITION AND OTHER WORK BASED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. I'LL NOW TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE END OF THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE'S STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM BENEFITS KICK OFF. MORNING CARE MCCARTY COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M ALSO WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MALIK WAS WORTH. I'M HERE TO PROVIDE SOME PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED AND WHY THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT IT'S THE PROPER VENUE. FOR CONTINUING TO SUPPORT K. THROUGH TWELVE CD PROGRAMS. THAT FOCUS ON PROVIDING TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION SERVES A VARIETY PURPOSES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AS THEY BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHEN THEY GROW UP. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA PROVIDES HIGH SCHOOLS WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO OFFER CTT PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY ALIGNED WITH REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. BUT SUPPORT DIFFERENT GOALS. PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORTH IN THE JANUARY BUDGET FOCUSES ON ONE PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND GOAL. TO PROVIDE CT WITH REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT ONE STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. THERE WILL BE JOB OPPORTUNITIES WAITING FOR THEM IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELD OF STUDY. RESEARCH IN THIS AREA SHOWS THAT HAVING A CERTIFICATE OR AN INDUSTRY RECOGNIZED CREDENTIAL LEADS TO HIGHER PAYING MIDDLE SKILL JOBS. A STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BOARD OF GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE ON WORKFORCE JOB CREATION AND A STRONG ECONOMY. THE TASK FORCE IDENTIFIED AN OPPORTUNITY THEY THAT EXISTED TO ALIGN THE MARRIOTT OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. OFFERED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND K. THROUGH TWELVE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. WITH THE STATE'S REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD BUILD UPON THESE ALIGNMENT EFFORTS ALREADY TAKING PLACE. THE PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY FUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIS FUNDING WAS INCREASED TO FORTY EIGHT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION. TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ESTABLISHED REGIONAL CONSORTIA IN EIGHT DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS ACROSS THE STRAIT STATE. TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN COORDINATING PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING CAREER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES IN EACH REGION. STATUTE REQUIRES EACH CONSORTIUM TO DEVELOP A FOUR YEAR PLAN UPDATED ANNUALLY AND IT'S POSTED ON THE PUBLIC STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM WEBSITE. PLANS ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING FOUR QUESTIONS. WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY AND EMERGING SECTORS IN EACH REGION? WHAT MORE MUST BE DONE TO SUPPORT STUDENTS OTHERS AS THEY PROGRESS THROUGH THE CAREER PATHWAYS IN THE IDENTIFIED INDUSTRY SECTORS? HOW WILL JOB PLACEMENT INTERNSHIPS AND REGIONAL INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT BE COORDINATED? AND FOURTH HOW CAN INDUSTRY INFORMED AND CO INVEST IN CT COLLEGES. WE BELIEVE THE SAME QUESTIONS APPLY TO CT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED AT THE K. THROUGH TWELVE LEVEL. EACH REGIONAL CONSORTIUM REPORTS THEIR OUTCOME DATA TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DISAGGREGATED BY RACE GENDER AND AGE. THIS INFORMATION IS POSTED ON THE LAUNCH BOARD DATA SYSTEM A TOOL SUPPORTED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THAT ALLOWS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND REGIONAL CONSORTIA PARTNERS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM CT WITHIN EACH STRONG WORKFORCE CONSORTIUM A DEPUTY SECTOR NAVIGATOR HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR EACH OF THE INDUSTRY SECTORS PRIORITIZE NOT CONSORTIUMS PLAN. THE DEPUTY SECTOR NAVIGATOR WORKS WITH REGIONAL COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS IN THE AREA TO DETERMINE THE WORKFORCE TRAINING NEEDS FOR THAT INDUSTRY. AND TO DEVELOP HERE CAREER PATHWAYS AND THE ASSOCIATED CURRICULUM. THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE STUDENTS SO THEY HAVE THE SKILLS NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THESE JOBS. THE WORKFORCE PATHWAY COORDINATORS THAT ARE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S QUE PROVE TWELVE CD. THE PROPOSAL WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH EACH CONSORTIUMS DEPUTY SECTOR NAVIGATORS. EVERY STRONG WORKFORCE CONSORTIUM HAS A DESIGNATED QUE THROUGH FOURTEEN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER WHO SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND ARTICULATION OF CAREER PATHWAYS BETWEEN K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THESE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS WERE INITIALLY FUNDED WITH S. B. TEN SEVENTY CT PATHWAYS PROGRAM DOLLARS. BUT THIS SOURCE OF FUNDING IS EXPIRING AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. MANY CONSORTIA HOWEVER I RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT WORK BEING DONE BY EACH OF THESE CASE THROUGH FOURTEEN ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS. AND THEY ARE ALLOCATING SOME OF THEIR STRONG WORKFORCE DOLLARS TO CONTINUE THE WORK OF THE ESCAPE ROUTE. FOURTEEN. ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS. THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM HAS STARTED SHOWING SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS AS DOCUMENTED ON THE LAUNCH FOR DATA SYSTEM. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE LAUNCHED THE STRONG WORKFORCE STARS PROGRAM. TO RECOGNIZE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CT PROGRAMS THAT SHOWN PROVEN GAINES AND HELPING STUDENTS INCREASE THEIR EARNING POWER AND SOCIAL MOBILITY. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED CT PROGRAMS OFFERED AT SIXTY FIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE EARNED ONE OR MORE STARS. BY SHOWING DATA DRIVEN IMPROVEMENTS IN THREE AREAS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN EARNINGS ATTAINMENT OF A LIVING WAGE AND FINDING A JOB THAT'S CLOSELY MATCHED WITH THEIR FIELD OF STUDY. ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN THAT ONE OF THE COMMON FACTORS OF CTE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE RECEIVED THE STRONG WORKFORCE STAR DESIGNATION IS INTER SEGMENTAL PARTICIPATION AND PARTNERSHIPS. THAT INCLUDES STRATEGIES LIKE DOLE ENROLLMENT AND ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS THAT HELP JUMPSTART STUDENTS CAREER EXPLORATION AND PREPARATION WHILE THEY'RE STILL ENROLLED IN HIGH SCHOOL. EVER SIX POINT FOUR MILLION OF THE STRONG WORKFORCE FUNDING PROVIDED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WAS SPENT WHAT PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT QUE THROUGH TWELVE CTD ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE MANY STRONG WORSE CONSORTIUM OR SPENDING FUNDS TO PROVIDE THE GET FOCUSED STAY FOCUSED PROGRAM TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE CAREER EXPLORATION AND GUIDANCE COURSE. MANY COLLEGES ARE ALSO OFFERING THE GET FOCUS STAY FOCUSED PROGRAM TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THROUGH DOLAN ROMAN. THE PROGRAM IS REACHING ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT SCHOOLS STATEWIDE. AND TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING DOLAN MOMENT CREDIT. IT'S FINANCIALLY BENEFITS BOTH THE COLLEGES AND HIGH SCHOOLS. ANOTHER STRONG MORSE WORKFORCE PROJECT THAT HAS RECEIVED RECOGNITION IS THE IT'S RAINING JOBS SUMMIT PUT ON BY THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND MOTHER LODE CONSORTIUM TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE COUNSELORS TO LEARN FROM INDUSTRY EXPERTS ABOUT THE EDUCATION AND SKILL REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH DEMAND JOBS IN THE REGION. THE GOAL WAS FOR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS TO BE WELL INFORMED AND EQUIPPED TO ADVISE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ABOUT MIDDLE SKILLS CAREERS. THAT WERE OFFERED AT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS NOTED MANY STRONG WORST STRONG WORKFORCE CONSORTIA ARE ALREADY SUPPORTING A LINE CTE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES OFFERED AT K. THROUGH TWELVE ELEAZAR. AND MANY SOLID WORKING RELATIONSHIPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED. OUR PROPOSAL EXPANDS ON THESE EFFORTS WITH THE GOAL OF HELPING STUDENTS MAKE WISE AND INFORMED DECISIONS AS THEY BEGIN TO PLAN THEIR CAREERS WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL. SO ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAMS THEY WILL OF LEARN THE SKILLS THAT EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING FOR AND BE WELL PREPARED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S WORKFORCE NEEDS. WITH THAT I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND KEEP. THANK YOU RYAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS THAT CHAIR NOTED OUR OFFICE AND GAVE A BROADER PRESENTATION ON CT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALON OUR CONCERNS WITH THAT PROPOSAL AT AN EARLIER HEARING SO. RATHER THAN REPEAT ALL THOSE POINTS I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS A THE. TWO ALTERNATIVES THAT WE'VE. PUT FORWARD AND HOW THOSE ALTERNATIVES WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SO THE FIRST IS THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE THE STATE FUNDS CTE THROUGH THE LCF APPROACH WE THINK THIS HAS. NUMEROUS ADVANTAGES OVER THE CATEGORICAL APPROACH BUT PRIMARILY WE THINK IT EMPHASIZES THAT CT IS PART OF THE CORE ACADEMIC CURRICULUM. OF A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION A. SO RATHER THAN DISTRICTS BEING CONCERNED WITH OUR WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN A CATEGORICAL PROGRAM AND. ARE WE MEETING THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF OF THAT PROGRAM THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR THEIR OBLIGATION IS NOT LIMITED JUST TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT SPECIFIC PROGRAM. NOW THEY'RE IN THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE LC FF APPROACH FOR EXAMPLE. IT IS ZOOMS THAT DISTRICTS ARE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR. ACTUALLY PROVIDING APPROPRIATE CT FOR THE THIRD STUDENTS THAT STATE ONLY RECENTLY INTRODUCED ITS COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD. MODIFIER STRENGTHENED THAT IF IT WAS CONCERNED WITH ACCOUNTABILITY. O. ALTERNATIVELY IF THE. LEGISLATURE WERE CONCERNED THAT NOT ENOUGH FUNDING WERE AVAILABLE IT COULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL BOMP. TO THE HIGH SCHOOL EL CFF BASE RATE. NOW IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE INTERESTED IN FUNDING CT USING A CATEGORICAL APPROACH WE DO THINK THAT THE EXISTING CD INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM HAS. OF SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL A IN PARTICULAR IT OFFERS MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR A SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE. A CD PATHWAYS THAT MIGHT NOT BE ALIGNED WITH THEIR REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS BUT. REGARDLESS OFFER BENEFITS. AT SUCH AS STUDENT ENGAGEMENT BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOESN'T PROPERLY LEVERAGE THE EXISTING EXPERTISE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF IT. EDUCATION AND SPECIFICALLY DESIGNING AND SUPPORTING HIGH SCHOOL CT PROGRAMS. WE DO THINK THAT THE THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM COULD BE IMPROVED UPON ITS CURRENT DESIGN. IT FOR INSTANCE COULD. BE MODIFIED TO INCLUDE. INDEED FOR EXISTING CATEGORICAL CT PROGRAMS THAT OF REMAIN OUTSIDE OF. BOTH THE INCENTIVE GRANT AND VLC FF APPROACH IT AND CONTRIBUTE TO SORT OF A SPLINTERED APPROACH TO CT EDUCATION IN THE STATE. AYE A COULD BE MODIFIED TO REQUIRE BETTER COORDINATION INCLUDING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES A IN A COULD BE WRITTEN A MODIFIED TO REQUIRE THAT SOME. A PROPORTION OF THOSE FUNDS BE USED IN ALIGNMENT WITH REGIONAL WORKFORCE. MEANS AND THAT'S ALL FOR MY COMMENTS WRITTEN. OKAY. DEBORAH VENABLE HAVE A STATE TO PRETEND IN A PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM PUBLIC SENTIMENT SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ICT INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND I THINK ALSO TALK ABOUT. SORT OF THE OUTCOMES OF THAT PROGRAM AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE WITH THE STATE'S INVESTMENT TO SHOW THAT IT DOES WARRANT. FURTHER AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN CT EASE SO WHAT WE AT THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION JUST TO PROVE THE FINAL ROUND OF. AND OF GRANTEES OF THAT WAS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX GRANT RECIPIENTS AND WILL NOTE THAT AS AS WE GAUGE INTEREST BECAUSE THIS DOES REQUIRE A MATCH THAT WAS NEARLY A BILLIONDOLLARS IN LOCAL MATCHES THAT AT LEAST HAD PLEDGED TO PROVIDE SO. I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE INTERESTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO TO PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY DCT  <u><c.green>PROGRAMS</c></u> WE'VE ALSO SEEN OVER THAT THE COURSE OF THE CT PROGRAM AND TO THE LEFT AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE. AT A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT NCTE PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN TT  <u><c.green>PROGRAMS.</c></u> THE INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT SHOW THE LARGEST GROWTH ARE INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM AND PUBLIC SERVICES. I'M UNDER THAT SEATED PROGRAM SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT IT CREATE AND EXPAND PROGRAMS. THAT ARE DRIVEN BY STUDENT INTEREST AT CURRENT REGIONALIST IT WAIT LABOR MARKET DATA INTEREST INDUSTRY ADVOCACY INVOLVEMENT AND ALIGNMENT WITH PROGRAMS OFFERED AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. I WILL SAY THAT THAT KATO CTE PROGRAM IS UNIQUE FROM OTHER FROM THE C. T. PROGRAMS IN THAT IT IS INTEGRATED WITH THE CT STANDARDS AND ALSO INCLUDES THAT CAREER TECHNICAL A STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS AND TO IN LEADERSHIPS BANG INTERPOL TO THAT THE CD COURSEOBJECTIVES AND STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE CONTINUUM OF WORK WORK BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCES THROUGHOUT THEIR CTE COURSE SEQUENCES. AND THE MAJORITY OF THE C. TAKE FUNDS WERE USED TO BRING CT PROGRAMS UP TO THE CURRENT INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND EQUIPMENT AND WITH CAPITAL OUTLAY DOLLARS BEING USED FOR A VARIETY OF STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT. BUT MOST OF THE PROGRAM'S THIS WAS THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE INDUSTRY STANDARDS EQUIPMENT SINCE THEY RECESSION IMPACTED INVESTMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND AND TEN SO THAT WAS REALLY IN THE FIRST. COUPLE YEARS OF THE FUNDING AT THE SEATED FUNDS WERE ALSO USED TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR CT TEACHERS AND CITY LEADERS AND COUNSELORS. WELL ALSO NOTE THAT THAT THE SEATED MONEY TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS AND SEVEN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO HELP UP PROGRAMS WITH THEIR CT MODEL CURRICULUM STANDARDS THE INTEGRATION OF THE K. TWELVE GENERAL EDUCATION COURSEWORK SO WE WILL REALLY ARE SAYING I'M. GREATER INTEGRATION OF CD PROGRAMS WITHIN THAT. AT HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM AND ALSO THE CAREER STE THAT STUDENT LEADERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS AND CURRENT COLLEGE PATHWAYS DEVELOPMENTS. I'M IN ADDITION TO THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROVIDED BY THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS COLLABORATE WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSESSMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY DIVISIONS TO PROVIDE. STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON UPGRADES TO CAL PADS AS WELL AS TRAININGS ON THE PERKINS GRANT MANAGEMENT WITH. THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY. AND WE'VE ALSO COLLABORATED WITH AT THE FACILITIES TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS THROUGH THE CT FACILITIES PROGRAM APPLICATION AND PROVIDE A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. TO NEW CT LEADERS TO RCT INSTITUTE. OVERNIGHT AND THEN WE AT AM I THINK AS WE LOOK AHEAD WE'RE LOOKING AT PRIORITIZING CT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL EXPANSION THEIR PILOT GRANT PROGRAM FOR TEN. MIDDLE SCHOOL CT PROGRAMS THAT ALIGN TO CALIFORNIA'S PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES AND WORKING WITH THREE TO FOUR TO PLAN FURTHER EXPANSIONS. WE'RE ALSO HAPPY WITH THE FOR THE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE FOUR HUNDRED CALIPHATE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES. AND PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT USE CONTINUE TO REMAIN A HIGH PRIORITY. AND I THINK WITHOUT WOULD JUST SPEAKING TO IT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAMS AND REALLY CONTINUED INVESTMENT AND THE SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORTS ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. INCLUDING THE LEGISLATION CARRIED BY MISTER O'DONNELL THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME ON GOING MONEY FOR CT. THINK YOU OWE ANY SHOULD ADD AS HAVE DONNA Y. IT HERE AGAIN WITH THE COLLEGE AND CAREER TRANSITIONS DIVISION TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. OKAY COMMITTEE BECAUSE. THEY Q. KRISHNASWAMY WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS TO MAKE CLEAR WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A LINE EFFORTS ACROSS SYSTEMS. THAT'S ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS WE'VE MADE IN OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS. AND WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ONE REASONABLE WAY OF DOING THAT I DO WANT TO NOTE THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY THAT GOES ON ALREADY. BETWEEN OURS BETWEEN SCHOOLS IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE MANY SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALREADY PARTICIPATED IN A STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM IN MANY REGIONS. AND MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS PARTICIPATE IN THE WORKFORCE PATHWAYS JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH ALSO INCLUDES MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION SO SOME OF THAT WORK. YOU KNOW IS ALREADY HAPPENING SO. WE'RE HERE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR LEAD ON THIS. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS ARE ALL START OFF THE ICE WHEN ASKED START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO I I I HEAR YOU SAY THEY SUPERINTENDENT. ENDORSES THE PROPOSAL. PUT FORTH BY A NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS NOT ONLY IN THE BILL BUT IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE WELLTO. GO UP TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. AND SO IN ADDITION ARE YOU ARE YOU RECOMMENDING THAT THE THAT THE PROGRAM STAY. WITHIN THE. A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LIKE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AT THE PAST. THREE YEARS. I THINK WHAT WE WOODS WHAT WE WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS REALLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE FOCUSING ON MAINTAINING THIS YES YES OR NO. I THINK GOOD SAY YES WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT IT WE'D LIKE TO MAINTAIN THE PROGRAM COMMENDED YEAH STANDARDS YET OKAY IT'S ONE OF DID CLARIFY THAT FOR THE RECORD. I WITH THAT YOU KNOW WE WE HAD A LENGTHY HEARING ABOUT THIS. A FEW MONTHS AGO SO I WON'T GET BACK INTO ALL THE DETAILS BUT. I SUPPORT THAT I KEEP IN THE THE AMOUNTS. WAY NORTH OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE WANT TO START AT FOUR START THREE AND WENT DOWN INTO THE NOTION WAS ALL THAT DISTRICTS WILL THEY'LL CONTINUE TO FUND THIS BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A HIGH PRIORITY BUT. AS WE HEARD FROM. A HEARING TWO WEEKS AGO LCF AFTER SO MANY OTHER NEEDS THAT I THINK THAT'S FANTASY LAND THINKING THAT THEY WILL FUND THESE PROGRAMS AT THAT HIGH LEVEL AND CONTINUE WITH THE NEED TO DO. ON TO SKATE FOR FUNDING IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO THAT SUCH A HIGH PRIORITY I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. AT SPECIFIC CATEGORICAL UP ON THIS ON THE AYE SUPPORTS AND A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THERE NOW I THINK THAT THAT BOOK TALKING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT PENDING ON. HOW REVENUES COME IN THE MAY REVISE SIR LOOK AND SHIFTING THINGS AROUND? AYE I DO YOU ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THAT WE SEE IT BEFORE BUT I THINK THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AND I'D SUPPORT. FINDING IT IN THE CD WHEN I THINK THAT'LL BE THE ACTION OF THIS SIZE SUBCOMMITTEE WE WE DON'T. SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATION TO PUT IN THE COMMUNICABLE GE'S. AND. THINK THAT THAT SIMPLE THAT. MR MARTZ RITCHIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I GO. WANT TO. REINFORCE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS ABOUT TO. WHAT I'VE SEEN AND IN IN MY DISTRICT IN TERMS OF? THESE. OUR SCHOOLS ARE ARE CAME THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. BEING SO STRAPPED FOR MONEY THAT. YOU KNOW WHILE THEY WOULD LOVE TO ME CT MORE PRIORITY. THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR TEACHERS FIRST AND THEN THEY HAVE TO. THE THEY HAVE TO BALANCE THEIR OWN BUDGETS AND SO YOU KNOW THEY DID THE READ THE. THE THE IDEAL IS IS IT'S NOT. BEING. CARRIED OUT IN THE REAL WORLD. BUT MY CONCERN YOU KNOW I I WONDER. HEAR FURTHER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AND AND TO SEE IF A. BALLET O.. CAN DOWN. HAD FURTHER PERSPECTIVE ON THIS SPENT. WHAT WHAT I SEE HAPPENING IN MY DISTRICT IS IS THAT YOU KNOW NUMBER ONE A AS? I'VE I'VE TALKED OFTEN BEFORE WE HAVE A WONDERFUL RE. YOU JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT REGIONAL OCCUPATION CENTER PROGRAM TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL CENTER. BUT INCREASINGLY WITH THE. CT INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM I AM SEEING OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS DEVELOPING THEIR OWN. CT PROGRAMS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE OVER THE. FAR RECESS I I VISITED THERE. TWO HIGH SCHOOLS IN TORRANCE NORTH HIGH SCHOOL IN TORRANCE HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN THEY BOTH HAD THEIR OWN. AEROSPACE ENGINEERING CLASSES AND. AND AND YOU KNOW THE USED EQUIPMENT TIP TO PURCHASE THIS WIND TUNNEL ON THEIR DESIGNING WINGS AND AND AND AND AND THEY HAVE LIKE A THREE D.. THE A DESIGNING SOFTWARE AND THAT THERE ARE DESIGNING. YOU KNOW AIR AIRPLANES AND AND AND. OTHER AEROSPACE EQUIPMENT. AND. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THATIT IT IT IT LOOKED GREAT. WITH THESE PROGRAMS BEING OFFERED TO THEIR OWN STUDENTS AT NORTH HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVE TORRANCE HIGH SCHOOL. BUT IT IT WAS GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN TERMS OF THIS. REGIONALIZATION YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IT JUST MAKES COMMON SENSE. THAT STUDENTS NORTH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WILL TAKE CLASSES AT NORTH HIGH SCHOOL AND TORRANCE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO TAKE CLASSES THAT TORRANCE HIGH SCHOOL. AND SO YOU KNOW THIS RITA REGIONAL CONSORTIUM IDEA IN A WHILE IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE THEY YOU ALIGN ALL THE. BE THERE THAT THE. THE INDUSTRY NEEDS A AT A REGIONAL LEVEL AND AND AND YOU ALIGN THESE PROGRAMS AND YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DUAL ENROLLMENT AND SO FORTH. BUT IT'S IT SEEMS LIKE. THAT GOES AGAINST SOME OF THE BASIC REALITIES OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE GONNA STAY. WERE WHAT'S OF TWO WORDS BUT FAMILIAR TO THEM AND ELECTED A SKIT AND THEY'RE GONNA THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO STAY AT THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS IN AND SO TO ME. YOU KNOW. I I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE THIS REGIONAL CONSORTIUM IDEA. WOULD. BE CONSISTENT WITH THE REALITY OF OUR MOST STUDENTS WOULD WANNA GO TO WHAT'S MOST CONVENIENT AND WAS MOST FAMILIAR TO THEM WHICH IS STAYING AT THEIR OWN SCHOOLS AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING ADMINISTERED THROUGH. THE. THE CDC TECH PROGRAM AYE GUIDE LIKE TO HEAR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES. ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE MEAN OUT OUT. GO FIRST ON THIS BUT I THINK THE IDEA. SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS THERE TO DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE TORRANCE AREA AND THAT ARE OFFERING THE SAME PROGRAM RIGHT I WOULD THINK. YOU KNOW AERONAUTICAL DESIGN AND WHATEVER WOULD BE VERY EXTENSIVE BURKE OR EXPENSIVE IN TERMS OF THE KIND EQUIPMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE BEEN WHAT THAT. AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR. ONE OF THOSE HIGH SCHOOLS TO OFFER THIS PROGRAM. THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW IN PART FUNDED THROUGH THE THE ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN THE STRONG WORK FORCE. AND THEN SIMILAR TO DUAL ENROLLMENT MORE YOU HAVE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GOING TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO TAKE THE COURTS THERE AND THEY ACTUALLY GET HIGH SCHOOL PREDICT FOR THOSE COURSES. YOU COULD HAVE STUDENTS TAKING THESE. AERONAUTICAL TRAINING COURSES THAT THIS ONE HIGH SCHOOL RATHER THAN HAVING BOTH SCHOOLS SPEND THEIR MONEY ON THE SAME PROGRAM. YET SO I KNOW THAT THAT IS THE IDEAL THAT YOUR YOUR. YOUR. BASING YOUR PROPOSAL ON THAT BUT I'M SAYING THAT THAT GOES AGAINST THE REALITY OF STUDENTS WHO WANT TO STAY AT THEIR OWN SCHOOLS. AND SO WHILE THEM IT MAY NOT BE THE MOST. FINANCIALLY FISH AND I THINK THAT'S AN ARGUMENT FOR. THE ARE OCP THAT THEY HAVE THE. THE CAPITAL INTENSIVE. A CT PROGRAMS. BROUGH PROVIDED AT A REGIONAL LEVEL BUT I I AM JUST SAYING THERE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE REALITY THAT I'M WITNESS HERE THEY THAT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT STUDENTS WILL. DO WHAT IS CAN IT WAS CONVENIENT AND AND AND FAMILIAR TO THEM STATE THEIR OWN SCHOOL. SO I I I JUST WANTED TO. RATE IT YOU KNOW SHARE THAT OBSERVATION. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO GO AGAINST THE EFFORTS FOR REGIONALS. AND I JUST HAD TO. I I UNDERSTAND THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING ABOUT STUDENTS WANTING TO STAY IN PROGRAMS AND SO EXCITING FOR FAMILIAR TO THEM. BUT THE REALITY TOO IS ALSO THAT HIGH SCHOOL WAS A FOUR YEAR. YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE PATHWAYS TO GO INTO NON COMEDIC COLLEGE OR CAREER AND THAT'S REALLY THE GENESIS BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL. MISTER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MY CONCERNS I THINK THEY'VE. GIVEN CHAIRPERSON MOTHERS TO THEY CENTER AROUND MONEY GOVERNANCE AND PROBABLY TODAY MORE THE MISSION THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS OF THIS EFFORT. NEVER ONE OF THE MONEY APPRECIATED THE GOVERNOR'S RECOGNIZING THAT THAT YOU BEYOND GOING IT'S GREAT. AGAIN I SHARE WITH THE CHAIR SAID IT SHOULD BE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S WHERE I AM. BECAUSE IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WE INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS BUT ALSO ECONOMY IS ALSO ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. I DO APPRECIATE THE TWELVE MILLION FOR THE PATHWAY COORDINATORS I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. UNDER THE GOVERNANCE. MY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT TURN THIS MONEY OVER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES I STILL DON'T SEE. WHY WE DO THIS IT SETS OR VERY POOR PRECEDENCE? FOR BETWEEN ECOLOGY MANAGING K. TWELVE OPERATIONS IN SOME SENSE ON CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND THEN THE CONSORTIUM. WE HEARD SOME CONCERNS FROM THE ADULT ED COMMUNITY ABOUT THE CONSORTIUM MODEL. TO ME IT'S JUST YOU KNOW THE MONEY IS GONNA GET DOWN IT'S GONNA GO INTO OUTER SPACETHAT'S GOING ON THE SOVIET BLOC IT'S GONNA GET LOST. THERE'S GONNA BE FIGHTING OVER IT. WHY WOULDN'T THERE BE FIGHTING OVER I MEAN IF YOU'RE ON THAT CONSORTIA YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT FEAR OF DISTRICT? AND IF YOU'RE NOT IN AN EQUAL PLACE I JUST. I JUST I DON'T. TRUST THAT MODEL. BECAUSE I'D I I'D SAY IT'S INHERENT THAT POLITICS WILL PLAN TO WEAR AND IN THE INCENTIVE GRANT. I'M PRETTY CLEAR IT'S AN INCENTIVE GRANT OF YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO EAVIS SERRATED. I WATCHED IT. BEING OF HISTORY TO THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. WE'VE A SERRATED. YOU KNOW. KERR TECH LOCATIONAL EDUCATION NOW WE HAVE TO BUILD A BACK THE INCENTIVE IS THE BEST WAITED DO I THINK THE INCENTIVE. MODEL ACTUALLY BUYS INTO THE L. CFF MODEL TO AS WELL MORE SO THAN THAN THAN THAN THE OTHER. CONSORTIUM MODEL. BOB. PUT BUT GOING ON A MISSION WITH TEN I'M HEARING TODAY'S RUN LIKE I'M I'M HEARING OR WAS GOING TO THE GERMAN MODEL WHERE YOU PICK YOUR LANE IN SEVENTH GRADE. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE. MET THAT WORRIES ME BECAUSE I HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT STRONG WORKFORCE AND ALMOST. ADULTS MORE SO THAN CHILDREN MERRILEES OUR KIDS WE WANT THESE PROGRAMS A MIDDLE SCHOOLS WE WANT THEM HIGH SCHOOLS. AND WE WANT STUDENTS TO THERE'S A VARIETY OF PURPOSES WERE OFFERING CT IT'S NOT JUST THAT IN SEVENTH GRADE YOU'RE GONNA DECIDE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE. YOU'RE GOING ADVANCED MANUFACTURING THAT'S WE'RE GOING TO GO IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE YOU KNOW STUDENTS LEARNING STEM SKILLS STUDENTS GROWING. STUDENTS SEEING WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THEY MIGHT SEE AS A FIT FOR THEM. SO I I'D I I HOPE WE'RE NOT TRACKING IN THE SEVENTH GRADE THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M HEARING WHEN I HEAR A LOT OF THIS. YOU KNOW HIGH LEVEL TO THE INDUSTRY NEEDS AND THAT'S WHAT THESE KIDS NEED TO GO WITH THEY'RE GONNA PICK THEIR LAN WE SHOULDN'T BE PICKING THEIR LINE FOR THEM. SO AGAIN THE OVERALL MISSION OF THIS EFFORT IS KIND A GENERAL CONCERN WITH THAT TODAY TO. BUT. AGAIN I I REALLY THINK THE CONSORTIA YOU KNOW THE MONEY ON THE CONSORTIUM'S WERE WHILE I HAVE ONLY NEEDS TO BE MORE. AND. THE CONSORTIUM MODEL REALLY SCARES ME AS TO WHAT ULTIMATELY PLAYS OUT. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THAT I TURNED ABOUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT ON THAT. I CERTAINLY LIKE TO COMMENT. I JUST THINK THE WAY THE CONSORTIA ARE STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED NOW I'VE BEEN TO A MEETING OF THE A REGIONAL CONSORTIUM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND IT WAS AMAZING THEY WERE THEY WERE HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS THERE THE RECOUP SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE WERE INDUSTRY EXPERTS THEY HAD A PILOT TRAINING PROGRAM. AND YOU ACTUALLY HAD THE THE HIGH SCHOOL FOLKS TALKING THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ABOUT. WHAT COURSES COULD THEY OFFER TO THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PURSUING THIS CAREER? AND A WHINING THESE PROGRAMS THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF COORDINATION AND ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS PROGRAM SO I THINK THE THE REGIONAL CONSORTIA HAVE ALREADY SHOWN PROVEN SUCCESSES THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD OUTCOME DATA. THAT'S ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE LUNCH BOARD WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN OUTCOME DATA FROM THE INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM SO I THINK WE'VE KIND OF GOT PROVEN RESULTS THAT THE PROGRAM IS WORKING. WE'VE ALSO YOU KNOW WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED A LOT OF KEY THROUGH TWELVE. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE ALIGNMENT THROUGH THE STRONG WORKFORCE CONSORTIA AND WE JUST THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO EXPAND UPON IT WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE DOLLARS. INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO WOULD RECEIVE THE CAPE FOR TWELVE MONEY WOULD BE SWAYED BY A SEPARATE COMMITTEE. IN THE CONSORTIUM THAT'S MADE UP OF K. THROUGH TWELVE. EXPERTS IN AND PROVIDERS THAT WOULD BE SELECTED BY CAPABLE OF STAKEHOLDERS I'M. I AGAIN I I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT PART OF EDUCATION'S HANDS I'VE HEARD THIS CONCERNS WITH THE WAY THEY'VE HANDLED THE PAST BUT NO ONE HAS BROUGHT THOSE CONCERNS TO THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST. SO THEY HAVE CONCERNS THAT SHE SAID NOW HE REALLY LAID OUT SO WE KNOW WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE. CD NEEDS MORE SUPPORT DOLLAR WISE OR WHATEVER TO HELP THESE TO HANDLE THESE FUNCTIONS SO MUCH IT SAY THEY SHOULD SAY IN PUBLIC. SHOULDN'T BE JUST YOU KNOW KIND OF YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THE OPEN SECRET IF YOU WILL AND ON THAT POINT I WOULD JUST SAY BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD THAT CONCERN AS WELL BUT PROPOSAL IS NOT STRUCTURED THIS WAY. AS A SLIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT OR OUT OF CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THEY'VE ADMINISTERED THE CTD PROGRAM IT'S REALLY STRUCTURED THIS WAY BECAUSE THE GOAL IS TO GET THESE DOLLARS. DOWN TO THE LOCAL REGIONAL CONSORTIA IT'S WHERE LOCAL DECISION MAKING CAN INFORM BUT CTE CLASSES THAT ARE BEING OFFERED IN THE REGION WE THINK IT'S. IT'S BETTER STRUCTURED THROUGH OUR PROPOSAL RATHER THAN HAVING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT THE STATE LEVEL MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW REGIONALLY LINE. OKAY I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HOW THAT WORKS BETTER I'D STILL HASN'T MEDICS ARTICULATED A MAN Y. THAT'S A BETTER IDEA. AND WHY THAT'S NOT EVEN A PRECEDENT SETTING IDEA WHAT ELSE ARE WE GONNA HAND OVER TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO RUN WE HAVE OUR OWN. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE AND THEY'RE NOT DOING RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING RIGHT SO I CAN HELP FIX IT. I MIGHT LIKE TO KEEP YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO IN HOUSE. I JUST LIKE KEEP IT THERE PAGES JUST SEEMS TO BE MORE REFINED. AND THE MORE PURPOSEFUL. WITH THAT. ALTERNATE YOU MISTER THANK YOU. MY QUESTION FROM THE. OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. WE. FUNDAMENTALLY I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH REGIONAL ALIGNMENT. BECAUSE I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK IN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY READ WERE HAVING THEIR ON EMPLOYMENT RATES. PROPORTIONAL PROJECTION OF JOB OPENINGS. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT CHICHI MORE COMMON SEEN WAY? IN THE SENSE THAT. YOUNG WE'RE EXPOSING YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY KIDS OF COLOR AND WOMEN. TO MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE IN DIFFERENT AREAS EARLIER ON INDICATE TWELVE EDUCATION. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY MAY NOT DECIDE TO GO INTO THE PRESS PROGRAM WHICH TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. THAT WE PUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION. MAY MEAN THAT THEY DECIDE THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO CAL TECH CAN BE AN ENGINEER SOMETHIN SO. DID THE CT EXPOSURE. IS MUCH MORE. IN EDUCATION. THEN A NONVIOLENT RATIO THE. WE. ANOTHER REASON I LIKE IT IS IN THERE. AND THE. DECEMBER JANET IS BECAUSE. WE'VE. OUTLINED IN LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING. WITH A LOCAL CONTROL PLAN. AND NOW WE HAVE A DASHBOARD TO SEE HOW WELL WE'RE DOING. AND WE'VE SAID A NUMBER YEARS UP HERE THAT WE WANT TO DASHBOARD. TO INCLUDE CORRECT ACKNOWLEDGE CATION AS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN MEASURE. WELL. IF WE'RE GOING TO HOLD. THE SCHOOLS KATIE TWELVE SYSTEM RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING DEVELOPING THEIR EL CAP AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DASHBOARD. WHY WOULD THEY DO NOT CONTROL THE MONEY? SO TO ME IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT'S THERE. AND PROBABLY THE CENTRAL ISSUE IS NOT THE CENTRAL ISSUE BUT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. IS THAT THE ORIGINAL PLAN THAT I LOOKED AT IT JUST DOING THE NUMBER FIGURES. ON A ONE TO ONE RATIO WITH OPPOSE GOVERNOR'S MANAGER OVER THREE YEARS. AB ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD BE PUTTING IN CT. WAS A ONE TO ONE MATCH. IF THEY GO TO TO TO ONE MATCH YOU KNOW IT'S POINT NINE BILL IT'S ONLYNINE HUNDRED MILLION OVER THREE YEARS. AND ANOTHER COMMITTEE A SUBCOMMITTEE WE HAD HERE WE TALKED ABOUT UC'S. OVER IMPACT UC'S AT ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF EACH GRADUATING CLASS WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO UC AND WAS OUT THE RIGHT NUMBER. IN THE CSU. NUMBER. WE LAID OUT AT THE ACTUAL. BUDGETING WE'RE DOING IS THIRTY THREE PERCENT. BUT REALITY FORTY ONE PERCENT OF THE KIDS ARE GOING TO SEE ISSUES. AND THAT'S RIGHT NOT THE COSTS AND THE IMPACT ON THE C. ISSUES. SO WE'RE DOING A LOT OF MONEY AND THINGS FOR THAT UPPER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE KIDS COMING OUT OF SCHOOL BUT THOSE OTHER CHILDREN ARE COMING OUT. WE'RE NOT DOING SO MUCH FOR. AND I'M WONDERING BUT WE GOING TO DO FOR THEM. AND WHEN I'M THINKING ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE SAYING WELL. AND I CAME FROM TOWARDS HIGH SCHOOL. DE IDEA TO SORT OF GO FROM TORN'S TO WEST AYE AWARE OF THE GOING TO BE DOING TO DO THESE THIS BAG TO DD. CD <u><c.green>.</c></u> AND MAY WORK FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE ABOUT GREATER MEANS TO TRAVEL. BUT FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE LOWER THE ECONOMICS THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO. THEIR PARENTS ARE GOING TO PICK A MOP OF MOVING THERE FOR AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM WAS THERE NOT TO BE ABLE TO GET A CAR OVER THERE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE ECONOMIC MEANS TO GET THERE. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE. AND I'M AGREEMENT ALLEN THIS. WANT TO GET YOUR THAT WE THAT WE ACTUALLY KEEP THE MONEY IN THE SCHOOLS FOR THE WORK THEY'RE DOING. SO TO ME THE. THE MONEY WE'RE PUTTING IN OVER THREE YEARS YOUR PARITY TIME. OUR PRESENTATION HAD TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. THE. I MUST I SIGNED ON TO A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OR THREE BILLION OVER THREE. DOES I THINK WE'RE IN A TRANSITION SO YOU CARE BACK THE GOVERNOR UNDERSTAND WAS TALKING ABOUT GOING TO SAVE MONEY EVERYTHING OUT HAD DINNER WITH HIM LAST NIGHT HE SAID GREAT THINGS ARE FALLING DOWN NEXT YEAR. I GOT IT. BUT TODAY. WE HAVE THE MONEY. WE'RE IN A TRANSITION. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TRANSITIONS SINCE HE'D BEEN THE GOVERNOR WHICH I SUPPORT MANY THINGS HE'S DONE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO. DOUBLE DOWN ON CD <u><c.green>.</c></u> AND SENATE CLEAR MESSAGE EVERYBODY AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE'RE GOING TO INVEST NOT. FOR THE TOP FIFTY PERCENT THE KIDS BUT THE OTHER KIDS. THAT MAY NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. SO FOUR MAYBE THEM SEE THE LIGHT. AND WE WILL ACTUALLY START HAVE MORE WOMEN AND MORE PEOPLE COLOR BECOME ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS. SO. YOU'RE HEARING IT FROM THAT ONE SIDE OF THE AISLE YOU HEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE THE AISLE. AND I THINK I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE VOTES IMPORT CD  <u><c.green>AT A HIGHER</c></u> LEVEL. SO PLEASE TAKE THAT MESSAGE BACK. YEAH THE SPECIALNESS. OKAY. NOW WERE GOING GO ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. EDUCATION MANDATES I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FRANCE FINANCES GOING FIRST. AARON GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS AIRING IT OUT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PROPOSAL INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY FUNDING TO KATO DAILY ELEAZAR. WHICH ALSO OFFSETS THE EXISTING MANDATE CLAIMS THAT FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T. WITH THIS PROPOSED FUNDING THE TOTAL OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS UP THROUGH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. YEAR ALLOCATED FOR THIS PURPOSE IS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS AND IT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED ON A PER. EIGHTY A BASIS ESTIMATED TO EQUAL TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS PER EIGHTY A PER HELL YEAH. ADDITIONALLY THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL CONTAINS WITHIN IT A PROPOSAL TO RECOUP ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. OF OVERPAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BY ELEAZAR UNDER THE SCHOOL BASED MEDI CAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES PROGRAM OR ASTHMA. THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED WILL BE ALLOCATED THIS YEAR AS USUAL WITH THOSE ELEAZAR. AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED BETWEEN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAVING THEIR ALLOCATION GO TOWARDS OFFSETTING THAT TOTAL AMOUNT. OUT WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO HAVE THAT ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MASS MISTER KAPLAN FROM THE LA JOH. I GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D DAN CAP WHEN WITH THE LA SO YOU SHOULD ALL HAVE RECEIVED A HANDOUT FROM THE SERGEANT ENTITLED EDUCATION% MANDATES NOT BE SPEAKING TO THAT THEY'RE MY PRESENTATION. THE FIRST PAGES OF A HAND OUT PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF EDUCATION MANDATES IN WHAT THEY ARE IS THAT PROPOSITION FOR OF NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE REQUIRES THE STATE TO REIMBURSE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ARE ELEAZAR. FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF REQUIRES OF THEM. CURRENTLY THEY'RE FIFTY NINE SUCH EDUCATION MANDATES ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE. AND. TRADITIONALLY ELEAZAR WENT THROUGH A PROCESS OF. PERFORMING THE ACTIVITIES DOCUMENTING COSTS AND SUBMITTING CLAIMS TO THE STATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. I'M AS OF TWENTY TWELVE THEIR OWN ALTERNATIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR. PROCESS WAS DEVELOPED WHEREBY AND THE STATE DEVELOPED OF MANDATES BLOCK GRANT AND IN LIEU OF SUBMITTING CLAIMS. ELEAZAR COOPER TO THE PAID IN THE BLOCK GRANT. AND NOW THE STATE DEFERRED PAYMENTS TO THIS MANDATE. TO THESE MANDATES REIMBURSEMENTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BASICALLY FROM TWO THOUSAND AND THREE TO TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND THAT SUCH. A LARGE BACKLOG OF MANDATES CLAIMS DEVELOPED AT THE STATE. I'M HOWEVER IN RECENT YEARS AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE STATE IS COMMITTED PASSED SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS TO PAINT DOWN THIS MANDATE BACKLOG. THOUGH THE BACKLOG STILL REMAINS AT ALMOST ONE BILLION. I THE BREAKDOWN OF THIS IS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION IS ASSOCIATED WITH K. TWELVE AND THE OTHER I HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE VERY. THAT CLAIMS ON A PER STUDENT BASIS WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED ON PAGE TWO. OF YOUR HAND OUT YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE'S A LARGE VARIATION IN CLAIMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FIRST OF ALL MANY ELEAZAR A LACK CLAIMS ALTOGETHER ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONE THIRD OF COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND NEARLY NINETY PERCENT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE NO OUTSTANDING MANDATE BACK LOCKS. FURTHERMORE WHEN WE LOOK ON A PER STUDENT BASIS WE SEE THAT THE CLAIMS VARY QUITE DRAMATICALLY. FROM KATE ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE. WITH DISTRICTS THESE CLAIMS CAN VARY FROM TWO DOLLARS TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AND IT'S EVEN MORE DRAMATIC WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHERE WE SEE. THE CLAIMS VERY ON A PERSONAL BASIS FROM FORTY FOUR DOLLARS TO THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AND THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT ALL REQUIREMENTS THAT THE STATE. REQUIRES THESE ACTIVITIES OF ALL ELEAZAR. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED THAT THERE I THINK PROVIDED A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE RECENT MEDI CAL BILLING AGREEMENT WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED ON PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUTS ALL SKIP THAT. AND INSISTS INSTEAD JUMP TO OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED THREE MANDATES PROPOSALS. I AM WHEN IT COMES TO THE MANY BACKLOG PAYMENTS WE FIND THAT THE APPROACH IS HIGHLY INEFFECTIVE AND ELIMINATING THE BACKLOG OF THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES WE ESTIMATE THAT IT ONLY REDUCE THE MANDATES BACKLOG BY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN. MILLION DOLLARS. FURTHERMORE IF THE STATE WERE TO CONTINUE THIS APPROACH IT WOULD COST TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TO FULLY RETIRE. V. I'M ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR K. TWELVE MANDATES BACKLOG. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MEDI CAL BILLING REPAIR REPAYMENT PROPOSAL WE FIND THAT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RECENT OUR STATE WIDE AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE FIND THAT THE. MANDATES BLOCK GRANT CALL A PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS HELPS TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER THE MANDATES BLOCK GRANT. AS SUCH WE RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE DEVELOP A MORE STRATEGIC PLAN TO RETIRING BECKY TWELVE MANDATES BACKLOG. SUCH A PLAN COULD HAVE THE STATE IDENTIFYING AMOUNT THAT'S EQUAL TO EARN ACCESS OF THE CURRENT BACKLOG. ON TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDING ON A PER STUDENT BASIS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING FUNDING REQUIRE ELEAZAR FULLY RETIRED THEIR MANDATE BACKLOG CLEAN SURFACE. LEVEL. AND FINALLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S MEDI CAL REPAYMENT AND CALL UP PROPOSALS BANKIA. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SEPARATE UP HAVE A STATEMENT AND IN THE PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AT TOM PRO EXTENT AT THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE IN THE MANDATE PROCESSES IS VERY LIMITED SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD BUT AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE OKAY. THANK YOU. FOR THIS IS NOT A. AN IMPORTANT TOPIC BUT IT'S LARGELY A KIND OF A BALANCER AT THE END OF THE. BUDGET PROCESS DEPENDING ON. HOW MUCH? WE HAVE AN AND I I THINK YOU OUTLINED THE ISSUE. AND ALEJO'S PERSPECTIVE. WHICH IS. YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT OUT AND JUST GIVE IT ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS THE LAST FEW YEARS KNOWING THAT IT'S THERE UNEQUAL. ON. LIST AS FAR AS VIA BACKLOG REQUESTS BUT IN IT IT BUT KNOWING THAT WE'RE NOT REDUCING THE OVERALL. DEAL WITH. CHAVEZ. SO YOU KNOW QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. LAST ISSUE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STATE OPERATION. BUDGET PROPOSALS THANK YOU ACUTENESS I'M WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GOING TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S. STATE OPERATIONS BUDGET AS PROPOSED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON THAT THE GOVERNOR AND I MOVE ON TO THE SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA. US SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATE OPERATIONS. AT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION OF THIS AMOUNT TO OUR SIXTY FIVE MILLION IS PROVIDED TO SUPPORT PROXIMALLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED AUTHORIZED POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS IN THAT CONSISTS OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION AND FEDERAL FUNDS. AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION AND OTHER FUNDS THE REMAINING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS US SUPPORTS APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED THIRTY AUTHORIZED POSITIONS AT THE STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS. AND DIAGNOSTIC CENTERS ON THIS CONSISTS OF FIFTY ONE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. AND ELEVEN MILLION AND OTHER FUNDS. SO MOVING ON TO THE US SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA THERE'S NINE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. OF FOR THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING REVISING CONTENT STANDARDS IN SPECIFIED SUBJECT AREAS AS OUTLINED IN VARIOUS PIECES OF LET RECENT LEGISLATION. THERE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND REAPPROPRIATION GEORGETTE ADDRESS ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD AT THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL INFORMATION SERVICES. PROGRAM. THERE'S TWO OUT IN NINETY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OVERSEE ADDITIONAL STATE PRESCHOOL UP PROGRAM CONTRACTS.

AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TELL TO FUNDS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ARM IN ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND LASTLY SIX AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING. CREATE A LITIGATION UNITS RESPOND PUBLIC INFORMATION REQUESTS AND OTHER WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION LITIGATION. THAT CONCLUDES MY SUMMARY IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE LET ME. OKAY. BRIAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE EARLY THE SEWERS THE DEPARTMENT LAID OUT THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS. RELATED TO ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE BUDGET. EACH OF THESE REFERENCES EITHER A LONG STANDING. CONCERNED ABOUT CAPACITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OR OR A SPECIFIC. PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH INCREASE THE WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND IN ALL CASES EXCEPT FROM ONE WE WE THOUGHT THAT. AND IT IN FACT THE. AUGMENTATION WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE. A. CITATION. I'D IN THE ONE AREA WHERE WE HAVE CONCERN A IT RELATES TO A. RECENT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AB SIX NINE NINE THAT WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE. IT NOTABLY INCREASES THE WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO LITTLE BACKGROUND HERE. I'D CURRENT CURRENT LAW SO BEFORE AB SIX NINE NINE IS SCHOOLS WERE REQUIRED. INTO. ENSURE THAT THEY HAD APPROPRIATE POLICIES ENSURING NON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST STUDENTS FOR VARIETY OF CHARACTERISTICS. DISABILITY GENDER GENDER IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION NATIONALITY RACE RELIGION ETHNICITY RELIGION SEXUAL ORIENTATION. BUT TO THIS LIST AB SIX NINE NINE ADDED IMMIGRATION STATUS NOW IN ORDER TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CURRENT. WITH EXISTING LAW SCHOOLS WERE ALREADY REQUIRED TO HAVE POLICIES SPECIFYING HOW THEY WOULD ENSURE NON DISCRIMINATION AND HOW THEY WOULD INVESTIGATIVE FOLLOW UP ON REPORTS OF DISCRIMINATION OR BOWLING BASED ON THESE CHARACTERISTICS. AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT DISTRICTS WERE FOLLOWING THAT REQUIREMENT THE DEPARTMENT. DID ANNUAL THE. NUMBER OF AUDITS OF SCHOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD APPROPRIATE POLICIES INCREASE. PLACE A SPECIFIC WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AUDITED FORTY A DISTRICTS EVERY YEAR THEY HAD TO STAFF MEMBERS TO DO THAT. OUT. UP THE ASK FROM THE DEPARTMENT WAS FOR. ADDITIONAL STAFF TO. COMPLETE THOSE AUDITS NOW THAT. IMMIGRATION STATUS WAS ADDED. THE SPECIFIC FUNDS THAT WERE. INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET WOULD INCREASE THAT CAPACITY BY ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT IN ADDITIONAL STAFF AND WHICH IS NOT CLEAR ON A WIDE THE MARGINAL INCREASE OF INCLUDING IMMIGRATION STATUS ON THIS ALREADY LONG LIST OF. OF. PROTECTED CATEGORIES WOULD JUSTIFY SECTION BARGE INCREASE. ASIDE FROM THAT AS I SAID WE HAD NO CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. OKAY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DEBORAH BROWN ON BEHALF A STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TAR LOOKS AND I'M BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT WHERE WE SUPPORT THE A PROPOSAL PUT FORTH BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IN A PARTICULAR ONE AND NOTE ON THAT THAT THAT WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE FUNDING FOR THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION BEING INCLUDED IN THAT. JANUARY BUDGET HELPS MAINTAIN AND THAT THE CONTINUITY OF THAT WORKS AWARE APPRECIATIVE OF THAT AND ALSO THE FUNDING FOR THE SPECIAL EDUCATION WORK LITIGATION UNIT WE THINK THAT'S AN. AREA OF NEED TO WEAR WERE ALSO PARTICULARLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE M.. THAT THE CONCERNS AROUND THE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH WITH AB SIX NINETY NINE OBVIOUSLY WE SUPPORT THE. US DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROPOSAL TO TO FIND THAT THOSE POSITIONS WILL ACTUALLY DO THINK THAT THAT LEGISLATION REQUIRED MORE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND RIGHTFULLY SO. BECAUSE THIS IS A PARTICULARLY COMPLEX AND HIGHLY CHARGED ISSUE AND SO WE THINK THAT THE AND THE THAT THAT IT REQUIRES MORE ON THE DEPARTMENT TO BETTER HELP US SUPPORT DISTRICTS AS THERE IS THERE. AT BEING CHALLENGED BY THIS AREA AND SO WE ARE WE WHO HAVE REQUESTED POSITIONS TO HELP DEVELOP POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO. TO ENSURE THAT ELEAZAR COMPLYING WITH THE. ISSUES AROUND THEM RATIONS THAT IS THAT WE'RE MONITORING IT THOSE AGENCIES AND ALSO THAT WERE EXAMINING THE ADDITIONAL. AT DOCUMENTATION. THAT DID THAT ELEAZAR NEED TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH THAT HE ALSO ANOTHER AREA JUST AS THEY NOTED THAT THIS IS PARTICULARLY COMPLEX AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT DISTRICTS HAVE THE RIGHT. LEVEL OF SUPPORT SO IT'S ALSO AROUND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND AGAIN THIS WAS NOT I DON'T BELIEVE THE INTENT WAS JUST AROUND PREFER SENDING GUIDANCE LETTERS TO DISTRICTS THAT THAT THAT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH AND THAT IT DOES REQUIRE MORE. AND SO WE AS SUPPORT THE AD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES I'M FUNDING PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND AND HOPE TO HAVE THAT LEGISLATURE SUPPORT ON THAT AS WELL. OKAY. THANK YOU LET ME JUST ASK THE PART OF EDUCATION AREARE THERE OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU. YOU WISH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THAT JANUARY TEN. BUDGET AS FAR AS. NEEDS AND STATE OPERATIONS OF CD. THAT IT WE WE DO HAVE SEVERAL OTHER REQUESTS OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT THAT WHEN THAT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THEY HAVE DEFERRED UNTIL MAY AND SO. WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM ON GETTING SOME MORE INFORMATION AND HELP THAT DOES SO IT IT INCLUDES SOME YOU WE HAVE REQUEST AROUND TO THE. AT THAT. ENGLISH ONE A PROFICIENCY EXAMINATION. AMONG OTHERS AND SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK AND AND. AT NATIONALS THAT I AM I REQUEST AROUND THE AND THE PILOT BILLS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED LAST FOR EARLY EDUCATION AND SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THAT. OKAY YOU COULD SURPRISE THIS IS SAID NO. OKAY. I CAN'T SEE THAT. OKAY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THESE POSITIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT CD. I SEEING NONE. WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL. NO ONE CAN MOVE THAT WE ACTUALLY GONNA FINALLY CLOSE OUT AND ISSUE HERE. ARE MOVERS ITEM HERE ISSUE SIX. WE HAVE A MOTION AND. SECOND I MISS THE AMOUNT TO GIVE TO APPROVE THESE POSITIONS. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MCCARTY BY CABINET AYE. AMONG. MEDINA. MURATSUCHI O'DONNELL. I. VOEPEL. OKAY WILL NOW START WITH OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS CAN YOU PLEASE LINE UP IN THE MIDDLE ON AND IT'S ALWAYS PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO. ONE MINUTE OR LESS. OKAY. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTY BAO MOMMY OF CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR ABOUT. OUR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE APPRENTICESHIP ITEM OF WE WILL ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH FINANCE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BUT ARE EXTRAORDINARILY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. A DEALING WITH USING F. T. E. IS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR PARTNERSHIP. OPPRESSION IS FUNDED ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS ON PER HOUR OF TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT MOST THE HIGHEST LOW ACCOUNTABILITY FD AS YOU KNOW THE CENSUS BASED APPROACH. US SO WE THINK THAT THAT PRINT PRESENTS PROBLEMS IN THE REIMBURSEMENT. A LIKEWISE USING FTP MEANS YOU HAVE TO USE COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTORS WHICH. FOR PRECIOUS MEANS ALL OF THE JOURNEY MEN AND WOMEN WHO PROVIDE THE TRAINING NOW WOULD. BE PROHIBITED FROM PROVIDING THE TRAINING. BUT WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS. HELEN ROTH TELL THEM SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND WERE ACTUALLY RECIPIENT OF THE CAI GRANTS THAT ARE NOTED. IN THE HIGHWAY WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN REJECT WITH THE LA O. HAS SAID ABOUT THE I'M NOT PAYING THE HIGHER RATES FOR IN THE COMMUNICABLE JUST FOR THE INSTRUCTORS. WE ARE DOING PROGRAMS LV INTO OUR AND FINANCIAL SERVICES WHICH IS AUDITOR ACCOUNTING. CYBERSECURITY AND IT ALL OF THOSE REQUIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEY'RE DIFFERENT THAN THE IT. THE PUBLIC SAFETY ONCE THEY'RE DIFFERENT THAN FIREFIGHTERS AND. AND AS WE MOVE END TO THESE AND THESE ARE GREAT. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THERE'S NO SUSTAINABILITY WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOU ARE GOING TO LOWER THE AMOUNT THAT THEY GET BACK SO WE ARE OPPOSING THE US. AS WE MOVE IN IN THE WITH THESE INNOVATION GRANTS AND CALIFORNIA'S THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO BE DOING MASS ON WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES WERE DOING A AT AMERICAN RIVER. SO PEOPLE CAN TAKE THEIR CPA'S THE LVM WHO STARTS NOW AT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND IS MOVING TO NINETY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THROUGH A PROGRAM AT DELTA. WE'RE DOING ANOTHER ONE AT SAKS CITY SO THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS BUT THEY ARE BASED IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WE MOVE INTO THESE WHITE COLLAR PROFESSIONS. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICES RECOGNIZING IN THEIR PROPOSAL THANK YOU THANK YOU.

ARE IN TEACHERS UNIONS WERE EVERY TEACHER IS CREDENTIALED. I THINK WE'LL HAVE LONG TERM AFFECTS WITH THE ONLY TEACHERS NOT BUT EVEN WORSE. THE EDUCATION CODE DOESN'T SAY ADULT EDUCATION TEACHER SAYS CERTIFICATED PERSONNEL. I THING MY MY DISTRICT LAUSD WOULD BE VERY AGGRESSIVE. TOWARDS TEACHERS IF WE CHANGE THAT NOT CERTIFICATE HAVING A BETTER SOLUTION. WOULD BE SIMPLY TO MAKE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ADULT ED CREDENTIAL. SAME AS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THAT WOULD MEAN EVERY ADULT THE TEACHER COULD TEACHING COMMUNITY COLLEGE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TEACHERS. COULD SIMPLY ASK FOR THEIR CREDENTIAL BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY. MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FURTHER I THINK THE ADULT THAT BLOCK GRANT IS GREAT IT DOESN'T MY STUDENTS WANT THAT MOVES IN TOWARDS JOB TRAINING HOWEVER THE IMPLEMENTATION IN MY DISTRICT ABOUT A QUARTER OF ADULT IN CALIFORNIA.

SAY THIS IS ABOUT THE MANDATE ISSUE ON MANDATES ON. YOU'RE NOT GIVING ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHO SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WAS CMS. WERE. IN EFFECT WITH THIS IS BASED ON WHERE YOU'RE GONNA LOSE NINETY PERCENT OF THE FUNDS WHAT KIND A SETTLEMENT IS THAT WHEN YOU LOSE NINETY PERCENT OF THE FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS. THEY HAVE NO SKIN IN THIS GAME AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS A SIGNED A PROPOSAL ON IN FACT THEY MET WITH THE SCHOOLS COMMUNITY AFTER THEY SIGNED THE PROPOSAL ON ASK US FOR OUR INPUT. NOT TELLING US THAT THIS THING WAS ALREADY SIGNED ONE OF THE THINGS THEY GAVE UP WAS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL. WE LOOKED AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AN APPEALS FROM OTHER STATES AND WE FOUND AROUND LOOKING AT TWO THOUSAND APPEALS. Y. EIGHTEEN OF THEM WHICH WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA YET WE COULD NOT GET THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO FILE AN APPEAL. AS A RESULT SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS PART OF THIS IS A PAID BACK AND WE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD RECOGNIZE. D. H. CS IS ROLE IN THIS THERE WAS A RECENT AUDIT WHICH SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T MEET THEIR OVERSIGHT ROLE AND WHAT CMS SAID. ON WHEN THEY DID THIS DEFERRAL WAS PART OF THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM THAT I HAD BEEN CREATED WITH UNCLEAR. REASONING FROM THE STATE MANUAL THANK YOU. CHAIR PAMELA LOPEZ ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WE WANT TO ALIGN OUR OUR SUPPORT WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF. ONGOING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING THAT GOES THROUGH CD  <u><c.green>I ALSO WANT TO</c></u> KEEP OUR EYE TO THE FACT THAT EDUCATION AGENCIES HAVE USED THAT INCENTIVE GRANT FUNDING. TO SCALE UP OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT MOVING FORWARD THAT THAT FUNDING IS STILL AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR GOALS ARE TO SCALE UP THE COLLEGE CREATING THIS INDICATOR THINK THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS TINY CAMERA TAIWO AND I'M REPRESENTING BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS IN LOS ANGELES I AM A MIDWIFE AND I'D LIKE TO. SPEAK ABOUT THE FUNDING THE CRITICAL POSITIONS IN THE CD HEALTH EDUCATION. I IF I HAD MORE THAN A MINUTE I COULD TELL YOU LOTS OF STORIES ABOUT UMPTEEN PATIENTS WHO HAVE MADE THEIR WAY TO ME. NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY GOT PREGNANT BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD THAT YOU KNOW THEY COULD. USE COKE AFTER SEX AND THAT WOULD STOP THE PREGNANCY OR. THEY COULDN'T GET A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE OF THEY WERE GAY SO THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION THAT'S FLYING AROUND OUR SCHOOLS. AND. THIS FUNDING IS PRIMARY PREVENTION MY WORK IS SECONDARY PREVENTION AND MY IT'S MORE COSTLY ON THE BACK AND OF COURSE AS WE KNOW AND. THE THE THIS IS A PROVEN PROGRAM IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS. FOLLOWING THE ENACTMENT OF ROME THE SEE YHA THE PERCENTAGE OF SEXUALLY ACTIVE TEENS. STUDENTS WHO USE BIRTH CONTROLS INCREASED AND THE PERCENTAGE OF STE STUDENTS WHO GAVE ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY SO REALLY URGING YOU TO FUND THESE CRITICAL POSITIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBER OF RICHARD MARX AND ARE REPRESENT A SIX APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADE OF OR UNILATERAL A THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE DO APPRECIATE THE. EMPHASIS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS. PUTTING ON THE INCREASED A SPENDING FOR APPRENTICESHIP BOTH THE BACKFILL AND HIGHER RSI. HOWEVER WE WE DO DISAGREE. WITH THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE A TWO TIERED A SYSTEM WITH THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES. IN FACT SOME OF THE PRESSURE PROGRAMS. AND HAVE ARE CHALLENGED I WOULD SAY. WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES AS THEIR ELLIE A AND I THINK THIS IS A SET UP A POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH THEM. FOR. PURPOSES OF DECIDING WHO'S GOING TO BE THE INSTRUCTOR WHO'S GOING TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM A SO WE AGREE WITH THE LA A ON THAT PROVISION. IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S A PROPOSAL TO EXPAND A PRINT SHOP OPPORTUNITIES A I'M SURE I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT LABOR CODE SECTION THREE OF SEVEN FIVE. I CAN MAKE IT A CHALLENGE. TO CREATE OR EXPAND A NEW APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES IN CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK THOSE GOALS OF EXPANDING THE PRESSURE OPPORTUNITIES. PARTICULARLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. MAY BE CONSTRAINED BY THE. LABOR CODE THANK YOU. I GET AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I WANTED O KNOW TWO ITEMS. FIRST ITEM REGARDING A STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM. WE APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATIONS THAT APARTMENT A FEW MEN FINANCE MADE THIS MORNING TO SPECIFY WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO BE AT ITS EXTREMELY HELPFUL. NEVERTHELESS WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE STRUCTURE AND THAT'S PROPOSED ON HOW THE MONEY IS. SUPPOSED TO BE I'D UTILIZED TO THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE SYSTEM I THINK THAT THERE WERE CREATE SOME CREATIVE DIFFERENCES THAT HAPPENED WITH THE IT GUY UNTIL AT LAST TIME AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY POTENTIAL CREATIVE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN K. TWELVE ON CAN BE COLLEGE IN THE. FUTURE THE OTHER ASPECT I DID WANT TO NOTICE WERE ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO HAVING PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS USE IN REGARD TO THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT BILLION THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE FOR US AND IF WE WERE TO HAVE TO FUND THIS TO PROP NINETY EIGHT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. A REDUCTION IN THE ONE TIME FUNDS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS CAUSED TO THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM WE DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR. ARCHER SIX HAD WORKED IN GOOD FAITH THEY HADN'T RECEIVED PROPER GUIDANCE AND SO THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE DOING WHAT WAS NECESSARY. AND WE DO BELIEVE THIS NEEDS TO BE SOLVED SYSTEMICALLY BUT WE DO ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU. DENNIS ALL THE ON THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA GREENFIELD ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SEED SEVERAL IDENTITIES AND THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION WE'RE TALKING ON THE CORE TECHNOLOGY CATION. WE ACTUALLY THINK THE GOVERNOR WE WANT WE WANT TO BOTH READ A. I SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WITH IT WE PROVIDED HIM WITH SOME LANGUAGE ON ACCOUNTABILITY WE ALSO SUPPORT SEVENTY FORTY THREE FRANKLY. A AND THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH DOING THE INCENTIVE GRANT THE SENATE GRANT HAS BEEN PROVEN. A WAY TO FUND IT PUTS LOCAL SKIN IN THE GAME WITH A OF THE MATCH AND STATE MONEY AND WE SUPPORT. THAT WHAT WE DO THINK IS BOTH NEED ACCOUNTABILITY NEED A LITTLE MORE COUNTABLY SOME OF THE THINGS ARE DISCUSSED. ON WHERE THE MONEY GOES. AND HOW YOU MAKE SURE GETS TO THE HIGH SCHOOL CAREER TECHNOLOGY CATION EVEN. MIDDLE SCHOOL AND SO I THINK THAT COULD BE FIXED AND AND WE PROVIDED SOME LANGUAGE AGAIN THE OTHER. POLICY BILLS ALSO NEED ADDITIONAL CAUGHT A ACCOUNTABILITY WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE CLAWBACK AUTHORITY. WE ALSO THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE. ANTI SUPPLANT LANGUAGE IN THERE AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE USING THIS FOR THE SHOULD BE FOR. OUR EQUIPMENT AND AND THOSE CARS NOT FOR OF SALARIES SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FOR. FOURTH YESTERDAY I SPENT. ONE COMPLEMENT TOM TOWARDS THEM HE CAME TO THE FAA STAKE EVENTUALLY SEVEN THOUSAND FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA YESTERDAY. SPENT ALL DAY THERE. WITH INDUSTRY FOLKS TRYIN AND LISTENING TO THEM ON THIS. CHALLENGE WE HAVE WITH THIS CURRENT SYSTEM IS ON THE STATE LEVEL. INDUSTRY ENTITIES ARE VERY APPREHENSIVE ABOUT GIVING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO A STATE PROGRAM BUT LOCALLY HIM WITHIN REGIONS SO THE TECH INDUSTRY. THE AG INDUSTRY THEY WILL SUPPORT. LOCAL AND REGIONAL EIGHT OUR PROGRAMS SO LET'S AS IT GOES FOR WILL GO FROM THERE THANK YOU THINK THAT IS. HI FRED JONES CALIFORNIA BUSINESS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE AUTHOR OF LCF HALF WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN THIS BUILDING. TO SET ASIDE PERMANENT MONEY FOR CAREER TACK SO WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT. HAVING SAID THAT I JUST WANNA ME TO THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR OF THE MISTER O'DONNELL OF MISTER CHAVEZ MURATSUCHI ABOUT REGIONALIZATION ABOUT STATE VISION ABOUT K. TWELVE BEING BROADER. THAN JUST AND ONLY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU AND THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I THINK STILL NICOLE RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES A TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE WAS MADE BY THE PRISONER. IN OUR SUPPORT FOR KRETEK EDUCATION. WE TO YOUR GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS. RECOGNIZE THAT THESE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE FIND IT PERMANENTLY BEYOND AND THE SUNSET DATE FOR THE CURRENT INCENTIVE GRANT BUT WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE. THAT THE EMBEDDING THESE PROGRAMS INTO THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM IS NOT THE BEST APPROACH I ALSO WANTED TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THE COLLABORATION THE COORDINATION AND THE ALIGNMENT THAT WAS DISCUSSED TODAY BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS. IS CURRENTLY PART OF THE C. TAKE. PROGRAM THA IS PART OF THE ELIGIBILITY IN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AS AS WELL AS WELL AS THE ENGAGEMENT FROM INDUSTRY AND WORKING WITH INDUSTRY SO ALL OF THAT IS ALREADY IN THAT. DOT FORMAT AND WE CAN CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS JUST AS IT WAS TALKED ABOUT TODAY HOW THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING WITH THE TWO SYSTEMS MOVING FORWARD. FINALLY. I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT AS A RELEASE TO THE DISTRICTS HAVE GONE OUT AND I SEEN THESE PROGRAMS AS A RECIPIENT FROM THE MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY AT THESE PROGRAMS AND THEIR GOOD WORK WE HAVE SEEN WHAT THEY'RE DOING. SO I ALSO WANT ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T CHANGE THE RULES FOR THE DISTRICTS YET AGAIN THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW WE CONTINUE. OUR SUPPORT FOR KRETEK EDUCATIONS EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS WE HAVE A PROGRAM SUNSET AND THEN THE RULES CHANGE SO THIS IS WORKING IT'S A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WERE HERE BECAUSE OF THE SUNSET NOT BECAUSE THE PROGRAM DOESN'T WORK. AND SO I THINK YOU COMMITTEE CAN LOOK LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR TESTIMONY WITH THAT WE WILL ADJOURN. OKAY. WAIT. YES ULTIMATELY THAT A SEPARATE ROOM WAITING. MOSTLY A PRE. OKAY. THE OTHER NEXT TO. KATHLEEN WELCOME
