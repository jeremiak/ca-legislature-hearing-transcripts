00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:12.190
IF DURING A PANDEMIC WE HAD

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.402
BECAUSE- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.938
OF. THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:42.307
BUT IT DOES APPLY IT A LITTLE

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:47.212
BIT TO THE A. B. EIGHTY FIVE OR

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:47.779
THIRD ITEM. WHICH IS ONE OF

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:48.947
SEVERAL. OF THE BUDGET IS AT AS

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:50.248
WHEN I PLAY. THAT FOR THE

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:58.123
RECORD. GIVE ME ONE SECOND

00:25:58.189 --> 00:26:11.002
THIRD MORE LONG. THROUGH HAND-SIGNALS ACROSS THE ROOM OUR

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:13.505
DIRECTOR OF THE SENATE BUDGET

00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:14.072
THE DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT YOU

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:19.144
ARE CORRECT. THEN JUST- WANTED

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.746
ADDRESS MAYBE. A COMMENT YOU

00:26:21.813 --> 00:26:23.748
MADE AT THE ON SET AND THAT WAS

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:27.118
SAID THAT THIS BUDGET. OVERALL

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.987
OF WOULD MINIMIZE HARMFUL CUTS

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:30.522
AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THAT

00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:37.228
MEANS. MY POINT WAS IS THAT OUR

00:26:37.295 --> 00:26:41.833
GOAL IS TO TRY TO- MINIMIZE

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.168
HARMFUL CUTS THE CALIFORNIA

00:26:43.234 --> 00:26:45.203
RESIDENTS RECOGNIZING THE

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.073
IMPACT A PUBLIC HEALTH AND

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:50.275
ECONOMIC PANDEMIC HAS. DONE TO

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:52.277
OUR STATE BUT IT CERTAINLY IS

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:54.946
AN OUR GOAL TO PASS A BUDGET

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:57.816
THAT EXACERBATES HARM MY

00:26:57.882 --> 00:26:59.751
STATEMENT WAS ALSO ON IN

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:02.620
REFERENCE TO THIS BUDGET IN

00:27:02.687 --> 00:27:04.556
COMPARISON TO FROM MY

00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:06.691
PERSPECTIVE. THE PROPOSED MAY

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.860
REVISE THAT HAD A LONGER

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:10.528
TRIGGER LISTED HAD A TRIGGER

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:12.130
LIST OF CUTS THAT WOULD TO

00:27:12.197 --> 00:27:14.499
AFFECTS SOONER JULY ONE VERSES

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:16.468
WHAT. ARE BUDGET BILL HAS

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:19.404
PROPOSED TO REALLY KIND OF FLIP

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:22.907
THE TRIGGER PROCESS- AND FUND

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:25.877
THE PROGRAMS UP UNTIL THE POINT

00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:27.445
IF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS DON'T

00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:29.314
COMMAND THEN WE HAVE THE PLAN

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:31.750
HOW TO BACK FILL IN OUR TRIGGER

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:35.887
LIST IS- SHORTER. SO THAT'S MY

00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:37.889
POINT SO THEN ARE WE

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:40.892
ANTICIPATING A V. RECOVERY IT

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:42.660
JUST WHICH CAME DOWN LIKE ARE.

00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:44.929
A BIG ROCK INTO A INTO THE LAKE

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:47.165
IS RESPECTING AT THE- TO COME

00:27:47.232 --> 00:27:48.733
RIGHT BACK HIS WERE USING

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.736
RESERVES. AND ASSUMING REVENUES

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:53.204
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.540
AND IT WE'VE BEEN KIND OF ON AN

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:57.642
UPWARD TRAJECTORY SO WE'RE NOT.

00:27:57.709 --> 00:28:01.312
LOOK I DON'T SEE. SOME KIND OF

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.248
TURN DOWN FOR THE FOR THE STATE

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:04.549
I JUST SEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:08.653
DO IT. FOR THE WHAT WE CAN TO

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.121
KEEP THINGS IN PLACE FOR THIS

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.490
YEAR AND THEN WE CAN DISSIPATE

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:13.625
BUT THERE WERE THAT THE ECONOMY

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:16.327

OUTLOOK WHICH INCLUDED A YOU IN

00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:49.294
AN L. SHAPED SCENARIO. NON AYE

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.296
BUT I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT.

00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:54.232
YEAH MISTER REDDICK- THE MAYBE

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:55.467
I'LL ASK A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:57.435
HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:28:57.502 --> 00:28:59.671
PREPARED MULTI YEAR. BUDGETS TO

00:28:59.737 --> 00:29:01.840
ASSUME WHAT WE CAN EXPECT IF WE

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:03.341
DON'T GT IT A QUICK ECONOMIC

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.343
REBOUND WHAT IF THIS IS. NOT OF

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.778
THE WHAT IF IT'S A HOCKEY STICK

00:29:06.845 --> 00:29:08.113
LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION WHERE

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:10.014
WE HAD. A MASSIVE DROP AND THEN

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:12.016
IT JUST WS SUCH A SLOW SLOW

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:15.653
LONG CLIMB OUT. I AM JUST.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.155
WONDERING IF FOR. I'M CONCERNED

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:18.456
MAYBE WORK WE'RE DEPLETING ALL

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.859
OF OUR RESERVES AND HAVING. A

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:23.661
ROW A MAYBE A HIGHER. WEIGHT ON

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:25.697
FEDERAL FUNDING THEN WE SHOULD

00:29:25.763 --> 00:29:27.132
BE HAVING A WE'RE NOT

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:29.367
ANTICIPATING PROPERLY FUTURE

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.736
YEAR TRENDS AND THAT'S- WHAT

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:36.875
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. MAYBE MR

00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:40.378
PRESS ONE IF ON. MIGHT BE ABLE

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:40.979
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION MADAM

00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:47.285
CHAIR. YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:48.553
CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATOR

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.421
MORE LOCK ON AT THE QUESTION

00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:52.357
THAT YOU RAISE TYPICALLY THAT

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:54.392
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.160
GUESS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL MORE

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:57.028
NORMAL TIMES WE HAVE ARE

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:58.930
EXPECTED SCENARIO AND THEN WE

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:01.132
HAVE RECESSION SCENARIO SASUKE

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:03.334
SO TWO POSSIBLE WAYS IN WHICH

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.537
THINGS CAN GO OF COURSE IN THIS

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:07.939
SITUATION BY THE TIME WE PUT

00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:09.941
OUT OUR MAY REVISIONS FORECASTS

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:11.609
THE ECONOMY WAS ALREADY IN

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:14.546
RECESSION SO WHILE WE DON'T

00:30:14.612 --> 00:30:16.281
HAVE SPECIFIC. DIFFERENT

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:17.782
SCENARIOS OF THE WAY THAT

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:20.118
RECESSION CAN GO OUR ECONOMIC

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:21.519
TEAM CERTAINLY LOOKED AT THAT

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:23.555
AND WHAT THEY HAVE PROPOSED IS

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:25.456
BASICALLY WHAT THEY VIEW AS THE

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:27.692
MOST LIKELY SCENARIO GIVEN ALL

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:30.361
THE FACTORS RELATED TO THE PACE

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:32.797
OF RE OPENING ACTIONS BY THE

00:30:32.864 --> 00:30:34.399
FEDERAL RESERVE THE LATEST

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:35.800
UNEMPLOYMENT DATA SO HOLD

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:38.903
REFLECTED IN OUR ECONOMICS IN

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.538
THERE AND YOUR POINT ABOUT THE

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:42.907
POSSIBILITIES- THE ECONOMIC A

00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:45.510
SAX- THIS RECESSION AND THE

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:46.911
COMMON NINETEEN PANDEMIC GOING

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:49.280
ON FROM SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:54.652
IN OUR OUR WORK THAT WE DO. SEE

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.520
SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. ACTS

00:30:55.587 --> 00:30:56.354
NOT ONLY THE NEXT YEAR BUT OVER

00:30:56.421 --> 00:30:58.957
THE MEAT TERM AND SO VALUES THE

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:01.159
REVENUE THAT WE ARE PROJECTING.

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:02.493
DON'T MATCH THE REVENUE THAT WE

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.029
PROJECTED THIS TIME A YEAR AGO

00:31:05.096 --> 00:31:06.164
FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND WHEN IT

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:07.999
COMES BASICALLY TO THE RESEARCH

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:09.934
THAT YOU MENTIONED. IN THE NAY

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:11.669
REVISION WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE

00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:13.338
THAT FEDERAL FUNDING WE KNOW

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:15.173
THAT HOW THAT WILL ULTIMATELY

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.008
BE REFLECT. IN THE FINAL BUDGET

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:18.243
WILL BE THE RESULT THAT

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:19.644
WHATEVER THREE PARTY AGREEMENT

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:20.979
TIMES BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY IN

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:22.914
THE SENATE BUT CERTAINLY IN OUR

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:25.216
PLAN- THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:26.985
ACT. OUT AS WELL AS THE STATE'S

00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:28.620
NEVER SERVED IN OTHER RESERVES

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:29.887
THOSE WERE TO BE DRAWN DOWN

00:31:29.954 --> 00:31:31.489
OVER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:34.025
RECOGNIZING BACKS IT IS LIKELY

00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:35.360
THAT EVEN IF WE MAKE A

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:37.729
RELATIVELY. QUICKER RECOVERY

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:39.530
THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:41.332
WE DO EXPECT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:42.467
FINANCE TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:44.035
THIS RECESSION FOR SOME PERIOD

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:45.470
OF TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:31:45.536 --> 00:31:46.537
FOR THE THOROUGH INSTRUMENT

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:50.275
MAYBE AS A FOLLOW UP- YOUR

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:52.377
INCLUDING. TAX REVENUE. AS

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:54.145
FROM. NINE MILLION OVER THREE

00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:56.114
YEARS BY MIND NINE BILLION

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.783
SKEWS ME- I WAS UNDER THE

00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.784
IMPRESSION THAT WE WOULDN'T BE

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:02.587
RAISING TAXES BUT THE ONE

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:06.424
EXAMPLE IN IN TODAY'S AGENDA

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:07.058
UNDER A. B. EIGHTY FIVE IS THAT

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:09.327
WE WOULD. NOT ALLOW THE

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:11.863
UTILIZATION OF NET OPERATING

00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:12.930
LOSSES FOR THE NEXT THREE

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:14.465
YEARS. BEING AS A FORMER

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:17.101
SWELLED. BEING A CERTIFIED

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:20.004
PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT ACTIVE- YOU

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:22.507
KNOW WE'RE WE'RE HIT NUMBER BY

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:24.609
A LOCK DOWN OF THE ECONOMY. AND

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:27.312
SO NOW THEY'RE NOT. CREATING

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:29.914
REVENUES IN. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE

00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:32.583
LOSSES AND THE ONE WAY TO KIND

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.985
OF RECOVER FROM THAT IS TO

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:35.286
CARRY THIS FORWARD AND BENEFIT

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:37.488
FROM THOSE DEDUCTIONS AND SO

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:39.490
NEVER HITTING A SECOND TIME

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:42.193
WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS SHUT DOWN.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.731
BY THE CITY AND I'M JUST

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:48.966
WONDERING WHY WE WOULD TAKE

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:50.568
THAT KIND OF APPROACH AS

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:51.736
OPPOSED TO TRYING TO HELP

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.072
BUSINESSES RECOVER AND THEN

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:56.207
THEY WOULD GENERATE MORE

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.142
BUSINESS MORE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

00:32:58.209 --> 00:33:01.946
IN THEIR FORMALLY TAX REVENUE.

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:03.614
YES ON THAT ISSUE ALL SPEAK

00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:05.750
BRIEFLY TO IT I ALSO HAVE A G.

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:06.951
CHAMBERLAIN ON THE LINE AND I

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:08.286
KNOW I ALSO WANT TO DEFER TO

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:10.988
THE CHAIR- WHY NO- THAT BILL IS

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.056
A LITTLE BIT LATER ON THE

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:14.158
AGENDA BUT ALSO VERY QUICKLY.

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:15.326
TWO POINTS ON THAT POINT I

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.395
THINK THE FIRST IS THAT WE VERY

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:19.897
MUCH VIEW THIS AS A TEMPORARY-

00:33:19.964 --> 00:33:21.766
AND THAT THIS WOULD BE SPURRED

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.568
THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND THE NEXT

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:25.937
TWO CALENDAR YEARS AND PEOPLE

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.605
WHO HAVEN'T HEARD THOSE LOSSES

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.741
IN THE PAST WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.309
USE THEM AFTER THAT AND IF ANY

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:33.344
OF THOSE CREDITS- WERE TO BE

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:35.546
EXPIRING IN THIS TIME PERIOD-

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:36.881
THOSE THAT OPERATING LOSSES

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:38.516
WOULD CARRY OVER FOR AN

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:39.550
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME-

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:41.586
BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION. THE

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:43.421
SECOND POINT IS THAT THAT THIS

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:45.156
IS VERY MUCH A TEMPORARY

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:47.425
MEASURE- MEASURES SOMEWHAT

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:48.559
SIMILAR TO THIS HAVE BEEN

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:50.661
TAKING IN PREVIOUS RECESSIONS

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:51.863
AND GIVEN THAT THE PRESSURES

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:53.865
THAT WERE UNDER WE'RE HOPING

00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:54.632
THAT EVERYONE CAN STEP FORWARD

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:56.467
IN A VERY TEMPORARY WAY AND

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.136
THEN. WHAT HAS TO RECOVERY WAS

00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:00.304
ON- THOSE AT THESE NET

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:01.773
OPERATING LOSS IS THE ABILITY

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:03.174
TO USE THAT WILL BE RESTORED

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:05.109
AND THEN THE THIRD POINT I'LL

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:05.943
MAKE FINALLY IS THAT. THE

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.912
WEEPING COLLUDED A SPECIFIC

00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:09.814
PROVISION IN OUR SO THAT THIS

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:13.084
WOULD ONLY BE FOR TAXPAYERS AT

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:16.421
WITH. ABOUT ONE DOLLARS WANT TO

00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:17.522
MAKE SURE THAT VERY SMALL

00:34:17.588 --> 00:34:19.190
BUSINESSES MOM AND POP TYPE

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:21.793
ENTERPRISES DAY WOULD NOT BE

00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:23.661
PROHIBITED FROM USING THESE

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.630
THAT OPERATE LOSSES THIS YEAR

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:28.366
OR NEXT TO USE. OR ENTITIES

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:31.903
THAT HAVE A BOB THE ONLY OR IS

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.471
TO DO IT THAT IS OUR NEW

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:36.340
BROUGHT BY CREAM IT I THE- CAN

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:38.709
SUSPEND THEM USING LOSSES JUST

00:34:38.776 --> 00:34:48.119
THIS. SPORT AND THEN AS- BRAD

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:51.222
ECONOMY RECOVERS. ABOUT RENTALS

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:52.657

TO BE IN BUT THAT TO OUR TAX.

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.928
CAN THEY PAY ARE SALARIES IT'S

00:34:56.994 --> 00:34:57.995
THEIR HARD WORK AND ARE MAKE

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.464
THE HARM CAT. AND IT WOULD BE

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.199
HELP. THAT THEY SEE THAT IT'S A

00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:02.233
SHARED. THAT MAYBE WE DO NEED

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.701
TO ALSO MAY SOME HARMFUL CUTS

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:05.603
AND THAT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS. ON

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.839
THE SHOULDERS OF OUR TAXPAYERS

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:09.640
AND THAT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION

00:35:09.707 --> 00:35:12.810
MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.479
EIGHT AND TO BE CLEAR ARE YOU

00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:16.147

YOU KNOW SEPARATE THE TWO THOSE

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:20.818
WHO- ARE ARE LOOKING TO

UTILIZE- THE STATE PROGRAMS-

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.325
OUR TAXPAYERS TO. AND SO I

00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:28.426
THINK WE NEED TO JUST BE CLEAR

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:29.994
THAT IT'S NOT ONE GROUP VERSUS

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:32.497
ANOTHER. THEY TO OUR TAXPAYERS

00:35:32.563 --> 00:35:33.364
AND THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:36.334
GENERAL FUND AND BECAUSE OF

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.369
THIS PANDEMIC ARE GOING TO NEED

00:35:38.436 --> 00:35:39.937
TO RELY ON THE SUPPORT FROM THE

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:42.640
STATE. IT'S NOT TWO DIFFERENT

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:43.140
GROUPS OF PEOPLE FROM MY

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:45.343
PERSPECTIVE LET'S MOVE ON TO

00:35:45.409 --> 00:35:49.514

00:35:54.785 --> 00:36:00.625
TIME FRAME- I FIRST JUST WANTED.

00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:02.059
WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENDORSE THE

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:02.960
SENATE'S APPROACHING THE

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:04.829
CREATIVITY AND THE REFUSAL TO

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:07.365
ACCEPT- CONSTRAINTS OF CERTAIN

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:09.734
TIMING ON TRIGGERS HERE AND

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.334
REALLY TRY TO SET OUR OWN PACE

AND HOPEFULLY WASHINGTON STEPS

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:14.672
UP BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT A

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:15.773
REALLY TERRIBLE FRAMEWORK TO

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.575
INTO OUR POLITICAL IMPASSE

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:21.012
THAT. I WORRY WILL AMOUNT- TO

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:24.348
THE U. S. SENATE FAILING TO ACT.

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:25.816

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

MISTER PECK IS IT POSSIBLE THAT

00:38:40.317 --> 00:38:41.652
IN THAT WE'RE NOT DEALING TOO

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:43.020
MUCH WITH THE STRUCTURAL

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:45.156
DEFICITS IN THIS BUDGET THAT

00:38:45.222 --> 00:38:46.724
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:47.425
EXACERBATED PROBLEM IN THE

00:38:47.491 --> 00:38:52.563
FUTURE AS WE MOVE AHEAD.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.032
SENATOR NEAL SAID I THINK THAT-

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:57.301
CERTAINLY IT IS POSSIBLE ARE

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:59.503
OUT LOOKING COLLUDED THAT AND I

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.971
BELIEVE- THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.573
FINANCE ALSO ESTIMATED THAT

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.077
THERE S A STRUCTURAL COMPONENT

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.712
TO THE BUDGET PROBLEM THIS YEAR.

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.780
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO NOT

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:12.850
EXPERIENCE A RECOVERY- NOTE

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.919
THERE IS SOMEWHAT GREATER USAGE

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.487
OF SOME OF THE STATE'S ONE TIME

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:18.155
RESOURCES IN THE PACKAGE THAT

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:21.225
WE'RE- CONSIDERING HERE TODAY

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:22.226
AND IN THE EVENT THERE IS NOT

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:24.729
A- YOU CAN N IT RECOVERY. OVER

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:26.330
THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWELVE

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:29.567
MONTHS OR SO. IT'S LIKELY THAT.

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:31.635
ADDITIONAL ONGOING SOLUTIONS

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:35.139
WOULD NEED TO BE CONSIDERED- SO

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:36.941
THAT SOMETHING FOR ORDER I

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:38.576
THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP

00:39:38.642 --> 00:39:42.480
IN MIND. WELL I PERSONALLY AM

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:44.882
CONFIDENT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:47.084
RECOVERY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:49.153
STEEP ONE BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.189
BE A- SLIGHTLY IN PLANNING ONE

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:53.057
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:54.892
BOUNCING BACK. BETTER WE WOULD

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:57.795
CERTAINLY HOPE SO. BUT THAT IS

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.196
SOMETHING THAT DOES LOOM OUT

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:00.297
THERE AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:01.599
DOING HERE NOW IS GOING TO BE

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:04.668

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:35.733
MILLION DOLLARS. SENSE I WAS

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.701

THE REALIGNMENT AND TWENTY

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:44.742
ELEVEN GAVE A PRIMACY IN THE

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:47.978

HEALTH AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.808
THE HORRIBLE CUTBACKS IN HEALTH

AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT WE HAVE

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:23.914

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:26.217
TO RE LOOK AT THOSE FORMULAS OR

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:28.552
LEASE LAYOUT COUNTIES TO HAVE

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:31.021
SOME. FLEXIBILITY IN THE SEVEN

00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:33.891
BILLION DOLLARS THAT- WE HAVE

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:35.459
IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:38.495
REALIGNMENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:40.965
MY DISTRICT ARE. SCREAMING

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:45.002
ABOUT HOW. THEY DON'T WANT THEY

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:46.804
WANT CHANGES IN POLICE AND LAW

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:50.207
ENFORCEMENT. AND I THINK WE

00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:52.343
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RE LOOK

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:54.378
AT THE REALIGNMENT FUNDS AND

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:55.646
MAKE SOME SUBSTANTIAL

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:58.449
CONTRIBUTION. TO WHAT I

00:41:58.515 --> 00:42:00.651
CONSIDER TO BE A PROGRESSIVE-

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:02.720
APPROPRIATE AND IN THE INTEREST

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:04.655
OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND INNER

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:06.390
ANSWERS OF OUR HUMAN BEINGS IN

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:08.726
OUR IN OUR STATE. THAT WILL

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:12.229
OTHERWISE LOSE SERVICES. AND

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:16.867
MENTAL HEALTH. SOCIAL SERVICE

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:21.939
FOSTER CARE IN OTHER CATEGORIES

00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:24.808
SO I THINK. IT'S TIME TO RE

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:29.446
LOOK. AT THE PROCESS AND TIMING

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:32.316
OF THE FORMULA THAT WAS

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:34.518
ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY ELEVEN.

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:35.719
SO OLD FORMULA THERE'S A LOT OF

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:38.689
LAWS AND BEEN STRANGERS THE

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:39.290
INITIATIVE IS A LOT OF CHANGE

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:42.526
IN OUR SOCIETY. WE SHOULD

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:45.729
REALLY LOOK AT IT. AND HAVE A

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:46.931
LOOK AT IT OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:51.135
MONTHS. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW.

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:53.804
THERE'S HORRIBLE CUTBACKS

00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:54.405
THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA RESULT

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:57.641
IN MANY. PROGRAMS TO BE CLOSE

00:42:57.708 --> 00:43:01.712
TO HUMAN SERVICES. SO WELL WE

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:03.047
HAVE THIS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:08.585
DOLLARS. IN REALIGNMENT I WOULD

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:12.389
I WOULD URGE THAT. IN SOME WAY

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:12.923
WE LOOK AT THE REALIGNMENT

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:16.360
PROGRAM. TO REACH US NOT NOT

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.728
ADD TO THE SPENDING BUT LOOK AT

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:18.929
THE SPENDING THAT WERE WORSE

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:20.497
OUR SPENDING THAT SEVEN BILLION

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:23.300
DOLLARS. AND POSSIBLY REALIGN

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:25.703
THE MONEY TWO MORE IMPORTANT

00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:27.972
PRIORITIES THAT THE COMMUNITIES

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.073
OF TODAY HAVE VERSES TEN YEARS

00:43:29.139 --> 00:43:32.476
AGO THANK YOU. THANK YOU WOULD

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:34.244
FINANCE ARE LA L. LIKE TO

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:43.387
ACCOMMODATE ALL. I DON'T HAVE

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:44.855
ANYTHING TO ADD TO ENSURE HER

00:43:44.922 --> 00:43:46.623
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU IT IN JUST

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:47.891
A CLEAR FINE LOOKING AT THE

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:51.161
ALEJO'S CHART- SENATOR BILL THE

00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:52.196
FOUR HUNDRED WOULD BE IN THE

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:54.198
EVENT THAT THERE WERE. WE WERE

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:55.432
NOT ABLE TO SECURE FEDERAL

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:57.634
FUNDING WE HOPE TO INCREASE

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:59.970
THAT AMOUNT BEYOND WHAT THE

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:01.472
SENATE APPROVED AT SIX HUNDRED

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:02.773
MILLION TO TAKE IT UP TO THE

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.408
BILLION BUT AGAIN THE FOUR

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.209
HUNDRED IS IN THE EVENT THAT

00:44:05.275 --> 00:44:07.811
THERE- WE RECEIVED NO FEDERAL

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:10.280
FUNDING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:12.316
FOR YOUR COMMENTS PER SHARE.

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:13.550
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

00:44:13.617 --> 00:44:19.323
SENATOR SKINNER. I WANTED TO

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.192
ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT- MY

00:44:22.259 --> 00:44:25.329
COLLEAGUE ON SEVEN FIVE BUDGET

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:28.499
SUBFOSSIL. WE OBVIOUSLY IN SUB

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:30.734
FIVE IS WAS IT A FIVE AS HIS

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:32.369
BRAIN PRESENTED TO US THIS WAS

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:36.240
NOT THE INCREASE TO- DEALING

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:40.544
WITH THE- THE- BACK FILL OF

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:42.379
REALIGNMENT WAS NOT ADDRESSED

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:44.114
WE DID NOT HEAR IT WHEN WE HAD

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:46.550
OUR SAID. AND EVEN IF WE HAD I

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.185
WILL BE HONEST JUST BECAUSE OF

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:49.620
THE CONDENSED NATURE THAT ALL

00:44:49.686 --> 00:44:51.121
OF US HAD TO EXPERIENCE WE

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:52.389
WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:56.360
GREAT DETAIL. THOUGH I THINK

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:58.796
THAT NOT TO SAY I THINK. MY

00:44:58.862 --> 00:45:00.664
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE'S

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:03.734
POINTS HAVE MERIT THAT WE HAVE

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:07.638
MADE GREAT CHANGES TO OUR TO

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:10.107
MANY OPERATIONS AND POLICIES

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:13.610
REGARDING. CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:15.979
THAT WHILE REALIGNMENT WAS A

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:18.682
VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY THAT WE

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:23.554
ADOPTED. WE IN EFFECT WE IS THE

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.823
LEGISLATURE LET GO OF OUR

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:29.927
ABILITY TO HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT-

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:31.762
AUTHORITY NOT OVERSIGHT WE

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:32.930
ALWAYS CAN HAVE OVERSIGHT

00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:35.365
AUTHORITY OVER THE EXPENDITURE

00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:37.401
OF THOSE FUNDS WHICH WE PROVIDE

00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:40.404
TO THE COUNTIES. AND WE HAVE

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:43.574
NOT HAD A SAY FOR EXAMPLE A

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.910
DETAILED HEARING ON HOW THEIR

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:49.646
PRACTICES NOW ME A LINE OR NOT

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:53.250
A LINE WITH. I DO IT

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:55.919
TRANSPORTATION- POLICIES THAT

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:58.322
THE STATE HAS ENACTED. AND WE

00:45:58.388 --> 00:46:00.524
HAVE AN EFFECT REMOVED

00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:04.228
OURSELVES FROM THE ABILITY TO.

00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:08.465
ARE REALLY- EITHER TAKE BACK OR

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:11.335
OR DIRECT THOSE FUNDS BY THE

00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:13.370
WAY THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.539
WAS WRITTEN SO TO INCREASE THEM

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:17.741
RIGHT NOW WHILE IT MAY BE

00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:22.112
APPROPRIATE I THINK IT IT DOES.

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:24.281
NOT NECESSITATE A REAL HEARING

00:46:24.348 --> 00:46:28.852
AND PERHAPS AND ASKED TO LA- TO

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:31.355
EVALUATE. WHAT THESE DIFFERENT

00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:33.323
CHANGES HAVE BEEN HAVE MADE

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.893
SINCE REALIGNMENT AND WAYS THAT

00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:38.762
WE MIGHT POTENTIALLY RE LOOK OR

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:40.797
RESTRUCTURING ALIGNMENT SO THAT

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:42.900
IT IS OPTIMAL FOR ALL OF THE

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:44.935
OBJECTIVES THAT WE HAVE SO I

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:46.303
JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT IT IS

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.772
NOT ALL THAT ISBEFORE US BUT

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:49.973
GIVEN THAT WE ARE TALKING

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.578
ABOUT. A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION-DOLLAR POTENTIAL EXPENDITURE IT

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:57.614
IS SIGNIFICANT AND UNDER THE

00:46:57.681 --> 00:47:00.150
CURRENT THE WAY THE- ORIGINAL

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:01.318
LEGISLATION WAS WRITTEN

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.120
WOULDN'T REALLY ALLOW US TO

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:06.290
HAVE ANY FOR ANY FURTHER STORY

00:47:06.356 --> 00:47:06.857
OVER THOSE FUNDS IF WE PROVE

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:12.262
THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:14.231

YOU A FOLLOW UP MADAM CHAIR TO

00:47:18.068 --> 00:47:20.571
MY COLLEAGUES FROM BERKELEY AND

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:21.772
THE SENATOR VALLEY ON

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:25.008
REALIGNMENT. THERE'S A PORTION

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:27.511
OF THIS BUDGET THAT IS RELATED

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:30.214
TO CONTINUING REALIGNMENT OF

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.282
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:34.551
AND MAYBE HAVE MISTER VISION

00:47:34.618 --> 00:47:36.787
NOT THAN OR SOMEONE IN HIS TEAM

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:39.256
COULD COMMENT. ONE OF THE

00:47:39.323 --> 00:47:41.458
FAILURES OF REALIGNMENT IS THAT

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:45.896
WE- FITTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:47.864
A LOT OF THE AUTHORITIES THAT

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:51.768
THE STATE HAD FORMALLY ACCEPTED.

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:53.303
BUT I WOULD ARGUE WITHOUT

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.205
SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THE

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:56.540
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MEET THAT

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:58.175
TEST IN IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:47:58.242 --> 00:48:01.345
PROPOSAL. THERE IS A

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:03.313
REALIGNMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.449
THAT REMAINS THE REST OF WHAT

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:08.518
IS AN WAS THE YOUTH AUTHORITY

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:11.288
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BUT AS I

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:13.290
LOOKED AT THE FIGURES AND I

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:14.024
THINKTHAT THERE WERE SOME OF

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:15.292
LIKE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:16.760
SAVINGS THAT WAS ATTRIBUTED

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:19.796
MAYBE THEY CAN. ACTIVELY DETECT

00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:21.765
THOSE FIGURES. BUT WHEN WE

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.734
LOOKED IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.868
THAT WAS GOING TO BE

00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:26.870
TRANSFERRED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:28.872
TO MAINTAIN THAT RESPONSIBILITY

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:31.908
THAT WAS NOW BEING AS SOON BY

00:48:31.975 --> 00:48:32.376
THEM THERE WAS A GREAT

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:35.712
DISCREPANCY. AND PROBABLY

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:37.481
UNDERSTATED BECAUSE THE MISSION

00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:38.782
OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:41.251
IS ALL REHABILITATION THAT

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:43.153
REQUIRES A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.188
REHABILITATIVE RESOURCES AT THE

00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:46.990
LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL TO

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.792
ACCOMMODATE THIS POPULATION.

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:50.460
SETTLEMENT MAYBE FINANCE COULD

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:52.229
THE COMMENT ON THAT DISCREPANCY

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:53.997
AND HOW THEY SEE THAT LOCAL

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:54.798
GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:57.701
ASSUME THIS BURDEN TO HOUSE AND

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:58.468
TO REHABILITATE THOSE

00:48:58.535 --> 00:49:00.871
PARTICULAR. WHAT WERE FORMALLY

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:03.774
CALLED WARDS. MR THIS ONE OFTEN

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.475

COLLEAGUES. YES I'LL SPEAK I

00:49:08.378 --> 00:49:09.446
DON'T HAVE MY COLLEAGUES WHO

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:11.281
SPECIALIZE- ON THOSE ISSUES

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:12.616
THAT DIRECTLY ON THE LINE RIGHT

00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:14.885
NOW ALL CD RE BRIEFLY THAT WE

00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:16.186
HAD INCLUDED A NUMBER OF

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:18.722
ASSUMPTIONS IN THE NAY REVISION

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:21.491
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT OUR TEAM

00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:23.493
IS AN ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS ON

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.562
THIS ISSUE IN PARTICULAR- WITH

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:26.997
LEGISLATIVE STAFF IN TERMS OF

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:28.932
WHAT WILL BE REFLECTED. IN A

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:31.034
THREE PARTY AGREEMENTS SO UP

JUST. ATRUE UP THIS IS LAST

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:35.652
YEAR'S BUDGET AT THIS CURRENT

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:37.687
YEAR'S BUDGET AND WE WERE SHORT

00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:38.955
ON FIRE FUNDS WE HAD TO

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:41.424

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.427
MILLION FROM GENERAL FUND SITS.

00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:45.662
THIS COULD GO TO THE DEPARTMENT

FAIRS THROUGH JUNE OF THIS YEAR

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:56.372
I MEAN THE FINANCE IN THE CASE

00:57:56.439 --> 00:57:58.441
THAT THE FEARS OF LOS NINETY

00:57:58.508 --> 00:57:59.409
EIGHT MILLION THROUGH THIS

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:01.211
FISCAL YEAR. AND A GOOD TO

00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:02.312
GIVEN FORTY THREE MILLION

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:04.547
BECAUSE I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THE

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:07.617
STATE'S. ANSWER IS BUT PLAN AS

00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:09.285
I UNDERSTAND IT IS AT ALL THE

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:12.889
MANAGERS ARE MERELY FIRE FROM

00:58:12.956 --> 00:58:14.424
ALL THE- SEVENTIES FAIRS. NEXT

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:15.391
MONTHS WILL BE TO GET RID OF

00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:17.160
ALL THE IN THE EIGHTIES. AND

00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:21.898
THERE'S NO. SUGGESTION THAT IS

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:23.466
THAT JUST THE END OF THE END OF

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:25.501
THE GAME AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.503
THERE'S TALK ABOUT USING THE

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:30.406
FIGURES AS AS LOCATIONS WHEN WE

00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:31.941
HAVE EMERGENCIES WHETHER THEIR

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:34.277
FIRE THEIR FLOOD AND ANYTHING

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:36.045
SO WE'RE GETTING RID OF ALL THE

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:37.280
LOOKS LIKE THE GAME PLAN IS TO

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.048
GET RID OF EVERYBODY. WE'VE GOT

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:40.583
WE'RE HAVING A DISCUSSION ON

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:43.453
WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:44.587
STATEWIDE BEDDING AND THE ADMIN.

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:46.823
OF THE AUTHORS SPECIFIC WE ARE

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:50.393
NOT ALLOWING FEARS TO TAKE BETS

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.095
ON SPORTS GAMES WHICH MIGHT

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:54.731
HELP THEM MEET MEET SOME OF THE

00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:56.799
YEARLONG EXPENSES THAT THEY

00:58:56.866 --> 00:59:00.136
HAVE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS.

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:02.071
WHAT HAPPENS AND THE ONE WITH

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:04.307
THE FAIRS BY. AND WHAT IS THE

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.409
PLAN THAT FINANCE AS FOR THE

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:08.811
ASSISTANCE FOR THIS THIS A

00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:13.016
PARTNER THAT WE HAVE. THE

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:15.451
SERVICE WHEN OFFICE. YES SO ON

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:16.619
THIS ISSUE AND YOU'RE

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:18.588
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT- SENATOR WHITE

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:20.523
HOUSE YOU THAT THIS IS NOT A

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.525
POLICY PROVISION IN THIS BILL

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:24.794
THIS IS SIMPLY THE COST THAT WE

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.429
BELIEVE THAT WE ARE OBLIGATED

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:28.765
TO UNDERTAKE. AS THE STAIRS

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:30.934
THAT ARE STRUGGLING I TAKE PART

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.168
IN THE WHITE HOUSE PROCESS

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:34.103
WHICH WE KNOW IS VERY PAINFUL

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.571
AND THAT WHICH ARE YOU DESCRIBE

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:38.207
WELL I THINK RIGHT NOW THE PLAN

00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:39.409
THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS ON THIS

00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:41.010
FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND WILL

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:42.912
CONTINUE TO. DO YEAR- AND SO WE

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:44.881
WANT TO WORK YOU IN TERMS

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:46.549
DEVELOPING AN APPROACH FORKS

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.017
TRANSITION FOR MANY OF THESE

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:49.986
DIFFERENT SITES- AND IT'S

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:51.955
POSSIBLE THAT SUPPORTING. SOME

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:53.856
PROPERTIES MAY BE NECESSARY FOR

00:59:53.923 --> 00:59:56.392
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS- SO THAT'S

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:57.026
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE THINKING

00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:59.262
ABOUT A LOT IT'S OBVIOUSLY IN

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:01.597
THE CONTEXT OF A VERY DIFFICULT

01:00:01.664 --> 01:00:02.632
THAT BUDGET SITUATION WHERE

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:05.168
POINTING RESOURCES ANYWHERE HAS

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:06.903
TO BE WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.071
SCRUTINY BUT BUT THAT'S

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:09.339
SOMETHING WE'RE CERTAINLY AWARE

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.441
OF- BUT STILL BACK TO THE

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:12.475
ORIGINAL POINT. IT'S NOT IT'S

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.477
STILL THERE STILL IS SIMPLY

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.245

FIFTEEN MILLION- IT STATES

THAT. THE FACILITY AND STOCKTON

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:52.375
HAD LEGIONELLA BACTERIA WATER

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.177
SYSTEM HAD TO BE FIXED AND

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:56.079
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BRAND NEW

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:58.948
FACILITY THAT WAS JUST RECENTLY

01:01:59.015 --> 01:01:59.749
CONSTRUCTED SO I'M- CURIOUS IF

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:02.218

OCCURRING AT THIS FACILITY. YES

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:17.133
THIS IS FOR REMEMBER MEDIATION

AT THAT WE CAN NOW- AT THAT

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.437
FACILITY AND BASICALLY- OUR

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:22.872
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:24.073
IS THAT THE WATER USE OF THE

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.509
FACILITIES WAS ACTUALLY LAST

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:28.144
THAN WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THAT

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:30.246
DESIGN PLANS AND SO WHEN THERE

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:32.014
WAS A SLOWER FLOW OF WATER.

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.583
THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE GREATER

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.017
POSSIBILITY OF THE GROWTH OF

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.719
BACTERIA AND THAT WAS ONE OF

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.788
THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS SO I

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.323
KNOW THAT CITY SEE OURS TAKING

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:42.125
OUR CLOSER LOOK AT THIS AND

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.559
THAT THIS FUNDING IS FOR

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:45.561
IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION- BUT IT'S

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.430
ACTUALLY NOT NOT TO SOLVE THE

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:50.299
OVERALL ISSUE. AND SO THE WE DO

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:52.568
ALSO HAVE- BE KEY IN OUR BUDGET

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:54.537
PROPOSALS- WHEN IT COMES TO

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.305
BROADER REMEDIATION EFFORTS

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:57.340
THAT ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.375
ISSUE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:00.776

BASICALLY AT AS THE COST THIS

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.404

NEXT YEARS. OUR GOING TO GO A

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:14.149
CERTAIN IN. AND IF YOU ACCEPT

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:16.218
THIS BUDGET DID NOT HAVE A COPY

AND KNOW THAT WE RECEIVED OF

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:19.855
HEAT AS AN ALL OF THE IN THE

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:20.956
WATCHES HAD. ABOUT THE EXTRA OF

THAT WERE OPERATING A VERY DE

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.062
BY. AND WHY OF THE BEST THINGS

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:29.164
THAT WE CAN DO IS SURE THAT

SURE THAT WE'RE LANES. FOR A

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:37.939
ROBOT WORK. AND SO I THINK WHEN

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.574

THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.315
BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS OPERATE

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:48.750
MEASURE FOR THOSE THREE YEARS

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.218
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:51.119
CONTINUE TO MAKE SOME

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.721
INVESTMENTS ARE WAYS NOT CUT

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:54.122
THEM BACK AS MUCH AS WE WOULD

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.223
THEIR RIGHTS HAVE TO CUT THEM

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.825
BACK AND THEN AS THE ECONOMY

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.894
COVERS. THOSE BUSINESSES ARE

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.595
OTHER TAX PAPERS THAT HAVE

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:01.496
THESE NET OPERATING LOSSES

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:02.664
HOBBIES BUSINESS INSTEAD OF

GUARDRAILS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:08.370
ARE NOT ABLE TO USE THEM RIGHT

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:09.504
NOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:15.644
THOSE AND- THE DALAI FOLLOW. IT

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:18.180
MAY JUST MAKE A CALL THAT AND

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:19.981
LAST COUPLE MONTHS WE'VE SEEN

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:23.118
BUSINESSES WHO. DO NOT KNOW

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:25.453
WHAT THE FUTURE'S GO HOLES IN

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.855
THEIR THE BUSINESSES THAT

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.623
CREATE JOBS WE'VE SEEN WE KNOW

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:29.791
WHAT IS HAPPENED IN THE JOB

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:31.226
MARKET BECAUSE WE SEE THE

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:34.129
UNEMPLOYMENT SKYROCKETING

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:34.729
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY LOST THEIR

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:37.766
JOBS. SO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.668
AN ECONOMY THAT'S GOING TO WORK

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:41.603
BUSINESSES HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.305
AND THEN PEOPLE CAN HAVE A JOB

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:46.308
AND THEY CAN PAY. TAXES BOTH

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:48.143
THE BUSINESS AND THE INDIVIDUAL

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.612
SO I CAUTION YOU TO THINK THAT

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.214
IF WE HAD A LOT OF THESE

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.481
BUSINESSES ARE ON THE COST OF

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:54.849
IT OR ARE THEY GOING TO STAY IN

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:57.586
BUSINESS OR NOT. SO IF YOU.

01:20:57.652 --> 01:21:00.088
DON'T ALLOW THEM TO DIFFER.

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:00.689
EVEN IF THEY'RE OVER A MILLION

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:03.858
DOLLARS- THEY MAY NOT BE IN

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.360
BUSINESS AND THEN THERE IS FOR

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:07.095
SURE A RECESSION BECAUSE THEY

01:21:07.162 --> 01:21:08.163
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO HIRE

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:09.497
PEOPLE SO I JUST. WANT TO MAKE

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:11.333
THAT POINT AND DRIVING HOME

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:14.536
THE- BUSINESSES HIRE PEOPLE.

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:15.937
YOU CANNOT HAVE A JOB UNTIL

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:17.706
SOMEBODY HIGHER YOU. AND YOU

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:19.174
CAN'T PAY TAXES TELL SOMEBODY

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:22.911
PAYS YOU FIRST. SO IT'S- IT'S

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:25.013
NOT PRODUCTIVE TO PENALIZE A

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.048
BUSINESS HE WAS ALREADY BEEN

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:30.051

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.215
THE WAY THAT WE ARE THINKING

ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:11.152

ACCELERATION PROPOSAL ALSO MATS

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:17.792

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:20.195
OF THE THAT WE WERE I WAS AND

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:22.197
DOLLY HAD ASKED ABOUT WHERE IT

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:24.099
IS ABOUT WHEN CERTAIN PAYMENTS

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:25.467

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:27.535
USED THIS CASE IS DIFFERENT

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:29.871
THIS IS ABOUT USED CAR DEALERS

THAT THEY ARE LEGALLY OBLIGATED

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:38.580
TO REMAIN BASED ON THE ACTUAL

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.081
VALUE OF THE SALE SO THIS IS

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:42.283
REALLY AN ENFORCEMENT ISSUE

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.752
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS ON

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:45.954
