THIS FLOOR HAVE THEIR OWN

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:33.898
SIMILAR EXPERIENCES. WHEN IT

00:40:33.964 --> 00:40:35.399
COMES TO THE OCEAN AYE BUT THE

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:37.334
REASON WHY I'M DEALING AYE I'M

00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:39.069
DOING THIS RESOLUTION IS BECAUSE

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:40.771

WASHING UP ON BEACHES HERE IN

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:46.911
CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:48.445
THAT WE HAD A WHALE WASHED UP ON

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:50.314
THE BEACH IN THAILAND WITH. OVER

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:51.182
EIGHTY PLASTIC BAGS IN ITS

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:52.917

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.718
TWENTY POUNDS OF PLASTIC IN ITS

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:56.554

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.955
WHICH BECAUSE IT'S DEATH WE HAD

00:40:58.022 --> 00:40:58.923
WHALE HERE IN NORTHERN

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.658
CALIFORNIA WHAT'S UPON THE BEACH.

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:02.159
WITH THIRTY POUNDS OF PLASTIC.

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.661

BANNING A LOT OF THE SUN SCREENS

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.804
THAT WE USE EVERY DAY. AND THE

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:15.272
REASON WHY IS BECAUSE IT WAS

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:17.308
FOUND THAT CERTAIN INGREDIENTS

00:41:17.374 --> 00:41:19.009
WITHIN THE SUNSCREENS ARE

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:19.577
ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:20.611
DEATH.

THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD GETS

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:57.081
ITS FOOD FROM THE OCEAN AND WHEN

00:41:57.147 --> 00:41:59.283
THESE FISH ARE EATING CLASSIC

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.584
WE'RE EATING THE FISH AND WE'RE

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.086
