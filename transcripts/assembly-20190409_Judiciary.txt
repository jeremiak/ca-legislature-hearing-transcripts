TODAY'S TUESDAY. APRIL NINTH. WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE WILL START AS SUBCOMMITTEE WE DO HAVE AND SPECIAL ORDER OF BUSINESS TODAY AT NINE AM MISTER WOULD THIS IS AB. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR SO OUR ITEM NUMBER. ONE PLEASE GO FORWARD GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL I'D LIKE TO ALSO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL APPROACH MY OFFICE ABOUT CARRYING THIS BILL I DIDN'T HESITATE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THE HIGH COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED? FIRST AND FOREMOST TO PROTECT PATIENTS BUT ALSO FOR ALL THOSE WHO FEEL THE SQUEEZE OF EVER INCREASING HEALTH CARE COSTS. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR IS ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF FIGHTING AGAINST HI&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND WARRANTED FOR&lt;/c&gt; PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG COSTS. THIS BILL WILL STOP THE DRUG COMPANIES PROP PROFIT PROTECTING PRACTICE OF PAY FOR DELAY. WE'RE DRUG COMPANIES MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH IN ERIC'S DELAY THE PRODUCTION OF LESS EXPENSIVE GENERIC DRUGS. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WILL DO THIS BY PROVIDING A PRESUMPTION THAT THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BRAND AND GENERIC DRUG COMPANIES. ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE. THIS PRACTICE IS COSTING CONSUMERS AND PAYER SUCH AS MEDICARE HOW MEDICARE AND EMPLOYERS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. THE PHARMACEUTICAL ENGINEERING COMPANIES WILL TESTIFIED TODAY THAT THEY LIKE THE STATUS QUO. BUT LET ME TELL YOU THEY PREFER THE STATUS QUO BECAUSE IT TILTS THE BALANCE IN THEIR FAVOR. WHAT IS THAT FAVOR BRAND NAME MANUFACTURERS PRO LONG THEIR MONOPOLY WAY BEYOND THEIR PATENTS MAKING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS MORE? KEEP IN MIND THIS PRACTICE RESULTS IN GENERIC MANUFACTURERS MAKING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WILL CHANGE THAT. IT RECOGNIZES THE LEGALLY PROTECTED RIGHT OF DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO THEIR PATENTS ANTI RESTRICTED MONOPOLIES. I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR AFFORDABILITY AND COST CONTAINMENT WHEREVER I FIND THEM I HOPE YOU AGREE THAT THESE PAPER TO WOMEN'S. AGREEMENTS PAPER DELAY AGREEMENTS MUST END I RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR DRUG MANUFACTURERS OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY DO NOT ENGAGE IN PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS AND I APPLAUD THAT. IT'S MY HOPE THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY DETERRED DRUG MANUFACTURER FROM ENTERING INTO THESE AGREEMENTS BY ESTABLISHING A STATUS A STANDARD THAT IS PRO CONSUMER. JUST TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS -- FOR THE AG IS -- ACTUALLY FOUR EIGHT IT IS ROBIN FELDMAN -- A PROFESSOR AT THE AT THE UC HASTINGS -- AND WE HAVE SOMEONE FROM HEALTH ACCESS I'M SORRY FOR THE G. I'VE GOT MY HOW COME IT WILL SCREW UP ROBIN IS OUR PROFESSOR WE HAVE A SOME FROM THE AG'S OFFICE. HAVE TECHNICAL SUPPORT WE HAVE SOMEONE FROM HEALTH ACCESS HERE MY APOLOGIES. RIGHT THANK YOU I'M GONNA ALLOW THREE WITNESSES THE FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN STEAMED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT IS CAUSING REAL PAIN FOR PATIENTS AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP THEM. THAT ISSUE IS PAY FOR DELAY AND ITS EFFECTS ON CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS. SO WHEN TO COMPETITORS SHAKE HANDS AND AGREE TO KEEP THE CHEAPER DRUGS OFF THE MARKET. THAT'S BAD FOR CONSUMERS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS TRYING TO ADDRESS. SO WITH PAY FOR DELAY A DRUG COMPANY PAYS A CHEAPER COMPETITOR TO STAY OFF THE MARKET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. IT IS AN END RUN AROUND A SYSTEM THAT'S DESIGNED TO BRING GENERIC DRUGS TO THE MARKET MORE QUICKLY. NOW THE TEMPTATION FOR COMPANIES TO ENTER IN TO PAY FOR DELAY SETTLEMENTS CAN BE EXTREMELY POWERFUL BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH MONEY INVOLVED. SO FOR A BLOCK BUSTER BRAND NAME DRUGS THE DELAY OF EVEN SIX MONTHS CAN BE WORTH A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ARE PAYING FOR THAT. AND PAY FOR DELAY IS A GROWING PROBLEM. LOOKING AT THE MOST RECENT SIX YEARS OF GOVERNMENT DATA THEY WERE ALMOST NINE HUNDRED SETTLEMENTS BETWEEN BRAND AND GENERIC COMPANIES. THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR ALONE. NOW 90% OF THOSE RECENT AGREEMENTS IN SOME WAY RESTRICTED A CHEAPER DRUGS FROM ENTERING THE MARKET. IF COMPANIES AGREED TO KEEP CHEAPER MEDICINES OFF THE SHELVES WE ARE GOING TO SEE PRICES COME DOWN IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE. THE FINANCIAL EFFECT OF THE PAPER DELAYED REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL RECENT GOVERNMENT REPORTS GIVE A FIGURE FOR A SMALL SUBSET OF THESE AGREEMENTS AND THAT SMALL SUBSET ALONE PROTECTED FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL BRAND NAME DRUG SALES. GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S SHARE OF NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING CALIFORNIANS ARE ON THE HOOK FOR A LOT OF THAT MONEY. AND IT IS WORTH ASKING TODAY WHO IS PAYING THE BILL FOR THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. THE HEAVY BURDEN FALLS IN CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYERS. WHEN EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS THEY HAVE LESS MONEY IN THEIR HIRING BUDGET? SO CALIFORNIA PAYS IN THE FORM OF LOST JOBS LOWER WAGES AND OF COURSE AT THE END OF THE DAY CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS THEMSELVES HAVE TO PAY IN THE FORM OF HIGHER HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS. AND HIGHER OUT OF POCKET COSTS TO BUY MEDICINES BECAUSE VERY SIMPLY THE PAY FOR DELAY DEALS ARE HELPING TO FUEL THE SKYROCKETING COSTS OF MEDICINE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. QUITE SIMPLY IN A FREE MARKET ECONOMY WE WANT COMPETITORS EXPOSED TO FREE MARKET FORCES WE WANT THEM GOING HEAD TO HEAD TO DELIVER THE BEST PRODUCT FOR THE CHEAPEST PRICE FOR CONSUMERS. WE DON'T WANT COMPETITORS ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS TO KEEP CHEAPER MEDICINES OFF THE SHELVES. AND ONE DRUG COMPANIES AGREE THAT THE CHEAPER MARKET THE CHEAPER DRUG TO STAY UP THE MARKET WHAT'S GREAT THE TWO COMPANIES IS GREAT FOR BOTH SIDES. THE REST OF US PAY AND PAY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER ONE OBSERVATION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. IMPORTANTLY THE BILL DOES NOT FORBID PAY FOR DELAY SETTLEMENTS BETWEEN BRADENTON AIR COMPANIES. RATHER THE BILL FOLLOWS CALIFORNIA ANTI TRUST LAW LANGUAGE AND IT SAYS THAT IF COMPANIES ENTER INTO THESE AGREEMENTS. THEY NEED TO SHOW THE AGREEMENTS ARE PRO COMPETITIVE IN OTHER WORDS COMPANIES NEED TO SHOW IT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. IN THIS WAY THE BILL YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS A MEASURED RESPONSE TO DEEPLY TROUBLING PROBLEM. SO SO MANY CITIZENS UPSET AND OFTEN FRIGHTENED AT THE COSTS OF CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MEDICINES THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR THESE ISSUES AND THE PAY FOR DELAY BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. YOU CAN HELP PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETS BECOME MORE FAIR AND MORE EFFICIENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITH A POSITIVE SOCIAL QUORUM PLEASE CALL THE ROLL STONE HERE GALLAGHER CHAO [inaudible] TO GONZALEZ [inaudible] HOLDEN KALRA [inaudible] KILEY MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] PETRIE-NORRIS [inaudible] WRATH. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. THAT'S WHAT IS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS YES MEAN PILOT HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR MEMBERS I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO TACKLE THE SOARING COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. HEALTH ACCESS WAS PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WHICH CREATED FIRST IN THE NATION TRANSPARENCY AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE INCREASES. HOWEVER THE TRANSPARENCY LAW DOESN'T ADDRESS DRUG PRICES THAT ARE ARTIFICIALLY HIGH BECAUSE OF A LACK OF A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE THAT IS PURPOSELY DELAYED TO MARKET. CALIFORNIA CAN BE FIRST ONCE AGAIN BY PASSING AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR TO ADDRESS THE PRACTICE KNOWN AS PAY FOR DELAY. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WOULD CRACK DOWN ON THESE COLUSA AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BRAND NAME DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND GENERIC COMPANIES IN WHICH THE BRAND NAME COMPANY PAYS THE GENERIC COMPANY TO DELAY THE LOWER COST DRUGS FROM COMING TO MARKET. MEMBERS WHAT IS THE POINT IN CREATING LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS OF PATIENTS CAN'T AFFORD THEM OR GO BANKRUPT IN ORDER TO ACCESS THEIR MEDICATIONS. WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT HIGHLY SPECIALIZED DRUGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INSULIN AND ANTIBIOTICS DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES. LET'S BE CLEAR THIS PRACTICE IS ALREADY ILLEGAL UNDER ANTI COMPETITION LAW BUT AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR SHIFTS THE BURDEN OF PROOF IN EXISTING LAW. AND LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD SO THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS NEED TO PROVE WHY THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ARE ANTI ARE NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE. BOTH BRAND NAME AND GENERIC COMPANIES HAVE BIG THIS PRACTICE INTO THEIR BUSINESS MODELS BECAUSE BOTH COMPANIES BENEFIT. THIS PRACTICE IS THE DEFINITION OF CORPORATE GREED AND AT THE EXPENSE OF MILLIONS OF PATIENTS EMPLOYERS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A TWO THOUSAND TEN FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION REPORT FOUND THAT PAY FOR DELAYED AGREEMENTS COST CONSUMERS THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. ACCORDING TO NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURE DICK EXPENDITURE DATA THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS WAS SPENT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IT IS CLEAR THAT PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS. ARE ONE OF THE DRIVERS OF INCREASING DRUG COSTS. HEALTH ACCESS HAS A LONGSTANDING HISTORY OF WORKING TO ENSURE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE BOTH AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. WE BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR MEDICAL BILLS BUT WHEN THESE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CONSPIRE TO KEEP DRUGS OFF THE MARKET TO INFLATE PRICES. HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO EITHER PAY OUT OF POCKET OR THROUGH THEIR PREMIUMS FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH THIS PLEASE [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS RUNNING COULD GEORGE AND I AM A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SERRA I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND IS LEADERSHIP AND PROTECTING HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS FROM HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SERRA IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WHICH AIMS TO REDUCE PURCHASED PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY INCREASING ENFORCEMENT AGAINST COLUSA PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD A LOT IN TERMS OF TESTIMONY FROM PROFESSOR FELDMAN. AND FROM OUR HEALTH AXIS PARTNER -- SO I'LL I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THESE. TWO POINTS -- THESE AGREEMENTS ALLOW DRUG COMPANIES TO EXTEND ITS MONOPOLY OVER BRAND NAME DRUGS BY KEEPING LOWER PRICE GENERICS OUT OF THE MARKET PLACE FOR CONSUMERS FOR YEARS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THAT. IS THE PRO -- WHICH WE SAW IN IN THIS SUPER CASE THAT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT THEIR CIPRO AN ANTIBIOTIC THAT WOULD THAT'S USED TO TREAT BACTERIAL% INFECTIONS. PAID ITS COMPETITORS OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO STAY OFF THE MARKET FOR SIX YEARS. DURING THIS TIME SURPRISE MANUFACTURER MADE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES. WHAT WAS THE PRICE IMPACT TO CONSUMERS WILL AT ITS HEIGHT CIPRO COST OVER FIVE DOLLARS PER TABLET? BEFORE THE GENERIC ENTERED THE MARKET ONCE THE GENERIC ENTER THE MARKET THE PRICE DROPPED. TO LESS THAN TWENTY CENTS PER TABLET. THE SECOND POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS IS JUST TO HIGHLIGHT -- WHAT PROFESSOR FELDMAN SAID ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW HERE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SHIFTING THE PRESUMPTION -- TO PUT IT WITH THE PARTY THAT CAN BEST BEAR THE BURDEN THE ONES THE THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IN THE DOCUMENTS IN PLACE TO REALLY SHOW WHY THESE AGREEMENTS AREN'T ANTI COMPETITIVE IF IF THAT'S THE CASE. I'M. WHEN WE FEEL THAT THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS? FROM THESE HIGH PRICED PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS -- AT THIS TIME I WOULD JUST ASK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ASK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. AND ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR YOUR AYE THOSE WE CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE LIKE. TO SHARE THEIR SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. WHERE MEMBERS GET? SIR FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING -- IN A CENTURY ON BEHALF CONNECTION CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. JOY DEVON BOND BEHALF OF A A RP AND IT'S THREE POINT THREE MILLION MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK SENIORS OR ANYONE SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE PRESCRIPTION GROCERS MAKING FURTHER TESTIMONY TO SECURE SUPPORT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SEEN NONE AS THEIR OPPOSITION. SEE THE COULD YOU CLEAR THE TABLE FOR THEM WARNING WARNING. PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JEFF FRANCE SIR I AM -- THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR ACCESSIBLE MEDICINES WE REPRESENT THE MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC AND BASS SIMILAR MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN GENERIC MEDICINES SAVED THE UNITED STATES HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ONE POINT SIX SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS. TWENTY TWO BILLION IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. WE SHARE THE GOALS OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WHICH IS TO AND DELAYED ACCESS TO MEDICINES. ARE COMPANIES FIGHT OFF BRAND NAME DRUG PATENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND JUST BY. I COULD GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THAT THE DRUG HE MERA WHICH IS THE HIGHEST GROSSING A PRESCRIPTION DRUG IN THE UNITED STATES HAS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX PATENTS. THAT GO OUT TO THE YEAR. TWENTY THIRTY FOUR A NUMBER OF COMPANIES HAVE SETTLED WITH THE MANUFACTURE OF THAT DRUG AB V. -- TO BRING COMPETITION IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS IS ELEVEN YEARS EARLIER THAN THE EXPIRATION OF THE PATENTS AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE WAY THE BILL AS DRAFTED. THAT THAT SETTLEMENT WHICH WILL BRING A BY A SIMILAR TO HUMAN ERA -- ELEVEN YEARS BEFORE THE PATENT ACCESS WOULD BE DEEMED ILLEGAL. WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE BILL SHOULD ALLOW FOR PRO COMPETITIVE PATTON SETTLEMENTS AND AS IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED THAT THE BILL WOULD NOT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE BILL WOULD MAKE IT PRESUMPTIVELY ILLEGAL TO SETTLE PATENT LITIGATION EVEN IF IT EXCEPT EVEN IF IT ACCELERATES GENERIC ENTRY. IF ANYTHING OF VALUE INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS -- GOES TO THE GENERIC OR THE BY A SIMILAR THIS IS WHY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAD SAID THAT THE PROPER WAY TO LOOK AT THESE TYPES OF SETTLEMENTS IS. IS THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED A RULE OF REASON ANALYSIS WHERE YOU LOOK AT THE PRO COMPETITIVE YOU LOOK AT THE ANTI COMPETITIVE THERE'S NOT A PRESUMPTION EITHER WAY BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY COMPLICATED -- TRANSACTIONS. BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION ACTIVISTS THE FTC HAS BEEN STUDYING THIS. THIS ISSUE AND IN ITS LAST REPORT -- I WILL I JUST WANT TO READ TO YOU. THE F. T. C. FOUND THAT -- THAT. ONLY FIVE OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FINAL SETTLEMENTS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN INCLUDED COMPENSATION TO THE GENERIC AND A RESTRICTION ON GENERIC ENTRY THE F. T. C. CONCLUDED THAT THIS THIS IS THE LOWEST PROPORTION OF POTENTIAL. PAY FOR DELAY SETTLEMENTS RELATIVE TO TOTAL FINAL SETTLEMENT SINCE FY TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND OTHER WORDS OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SETTLEMENTS THE FTC FOUND ONLY. FIVE WERE POTENTIALLY PAY FOR DELAY. THE ACTIVISTS DECISION IS WORKING THIS TYPE OF RULE OF REASON ANALYSIS IS ELIMINATING THE TYPES OF SETTLEMENTS THAT ALL OF US BELIEVE SHOULD BE OUTLAWED. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOOD SETTLEMENTS DON'T GET THROWN OUT. WITH THAT SETTLEMENTS. THANK YOU THIS WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LINE IS REALISTIC SENIOR DIRECTOR OF STATE POLICY WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA. PHARMA HAS ADOPTED A POSITION OF OPPOSE AND LAST AMENDED ON AB. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WERE GRACIOUS WITH THEIR TIME TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS -- WITH THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THOSE MEETINGS AFTER THE BILL IS HEARD TODAY. ON THAT IS BECAUSE FARMER WANTS TO WORK WITH CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS TO COME TO A MIDDLE GROUND ON AB. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ARE CONCERNED WITH THE FRAMEWORK CREATED BY THIS BILL WE'RE CONCERNED WITH THE CREATION OF A PRESUMPTION THAT CERTAIN AGREEMENTS ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE. COUPLED WITH THE HIGHER EVENT ENTRY STANDARD OF CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE AND THE LIMITS -- IN WAYS IN WHICH THE DEFENDANTS CAN REBUT THE PRESUMPTION THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE BELIEVE -- IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE TO THE BILL ALSO THE BILL'S PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION POTENTIALLY EXPANDS LIABILITY FOR CONDUCT THAT IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY UNDER STATE LAWS AND WILL FURTHER. INCREASE UNCERTAINTY FOR BRANDON GENERIC MANUFACTURERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND WE ARE HOPEFUL TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. WHAT ELSE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD GO FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE? ALL RIGHT SEE NONE I'M GOING TO BRING THIS. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISS WHAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK THIS HIGHLIGHTS. A SIGNIFICANT TENSION BETWEEN PATTON LINE AT A TRUST LAW. WHICH HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED OVER THE YEARS CONSTITUTION OBVIOUSLY THE SOURCE OF THE PAT Là INTENTIONALLY GIVING A MONOPOLY. AND THAT HAS OFTEN BEEN ABUSED IN AS WE TRY HAS TRIED TO NAVIGATE THIS OVER THE YEARS. BOTH OF THE FEDERAL THE STATE LEVEL [inaudible] BUILDING IN. ANY TRUSTED IN GOING AFTER THOSE WHO ARE ABUSING THEIR SIGNIFICANT. MARKET POWER HAS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE SO FROM OUR STANDPOINT FROM THIS COMMITTEE STANDPOINT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE A FRAMEWORK AND SHIFT THE PRESUMPTION SAID OF BEN. BEN OUT THERE BECAUSE WITH THE LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF POWER IN THE MARKET PLACE. SMALLER GENERIC BRANDS WHICH ARE GOOD FOR CONSUMERS ANDGOOD FOR GETTING DRUG THERAPIES OUT INTO THE MARKET IS REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT SO I THINK. YOUR APPROACH IS IS CORRECT. AND AS YOU TO CONTINUE SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S PROBABLY GONNA BE SOME CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT YOU LET US KNOW AS THAT GOES MISTER WOULD BECAUSE I'M GOING WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY CRITICAL I THINK OF SHOOTING THIS TOO FAR AWAY SO THAT WE I DO. NOT WANT TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE WE WERE BACK. TO I'M COMPETITIVE SO ESSENTIALLY AND A TRUST BEHAVIOR WITHOUT THE OVERSIGHT. AND ESTABLISHING A PRESUMPTION AND THIS AND THE ABILITY REBUT IT AS DONE IN IN THIS BILL I THINK IS A PRETTY GOOD FRAMEWORK FOR BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THAT IS CLEARLY SHIFTED I THINK TOO FAR THE OTHER DIRECTION SO. APPRECIATE YOU. IN THIS FORWARD [inaudible] I'M SORRY. IT WAS THERE DID I MISS AN OPPOSITION WITNESS I APOLOGIZE MISTER JIMMY JACKSON ON BEHALF BY A COMMON OPPOSITE OPPOSITE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. OTHER. COMMENTS BIZRATE'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I DO WANT TO THANK DOCTOR WOULD FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL. YESTERDAY IN SUB ONE WE TALKED ABOUT THE VERY ISSUE. OF THE HIGH COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. I APPRECIATE THAT THERE CONTINUES TO BE CONVERSATION BUT I I JOIN WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR IN MAKING SURE THAT. IN THE END WE HAVE THE PROTECTION FOR THE CONSUMER -- WE DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO TO WORK WITH THAT WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. BUT IN THE END OF THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT -- I HATE TO USE THE WORD COLLUSION BUT JUST. EIGHTY EVERYTHING THAT WE LEARNED FROM THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE SETTLEMENTS -- AS YOU'VE MENTIONED IT DOES PROVIDE IT'S IT'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S THE END ALL THE IT IS A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION BUT I THINK THAT IT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD WHEN YOU HAVE THAT PRESUMPTION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THE IN THE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- LOSS OF REVENUE WERE TALKING ABOUT LOTS OF THINGS BUT IN THE END IT'S THE CONSUMER THAT WE HAVE TO BE MOST CONCERNED WITH. AND HAVING THESE CONTROLS IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY GOOD I THANK YOU FOR BRING IT FORWARD AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. THANK YOU AT THE SITE MR OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER TERRACE SOMEONE AND I THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED AND I THINK YOU'RE DOING A REALLY GREAT JOB OF WORKING WITH. ALL SIDES TRYING CRAFTED A FAIR AND COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO IT AND I'M I'M TRYING TO GET TO A POSITION OF SUPPORT. I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE BILL'S SUPPORTERS ONE FOR HEALTH ACCESS AND ONE FOR THE AG IF WE COULD -- GET THEM BACK UP. SO FIRST FIRST HEALTH ACCESS WE HEARD THE OPPOSITION TESTIFIED THAT GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS FEEL. THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF GENERICS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS RESULT IN GENERICS BEING AVAILABLE EARLIER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE. UNDER THE PATENT EXPIRATION. CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT CONCERN BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO CONCERNED THAT I SHARE -- TO HEALTH ACCESSORY YOU DON'T THINK SO ST OKAY -- SERVICES ON A WE DISAGREE THAT THE BILL WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT -- AND THAT GENERICS WILL ACTUALLY NOT COME TO MARKET SOONER AND I CAN TURN IT OVER -- TO THE AG'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THERE BUT WE DISAGREE WITH THAT -- AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE AGREEMENTS. PRO LONG THE TIME THAT THE BRAND NAME IS ON THE MARKET AND SORT OF THE GENERIC AND THE BILL -- ADDRESSES THAT AN ALTERNATE OVER THE J. AG'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THERE. OR PERHAPS I COULD END THIS IS PROFESSOR FELDMAN. IT'S TOUGH TO BE GENERIC THESE DAYS THE INDUSTRY IS REELING FROM A VARIETY OF ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR SINCE. FROM BRAND NAME COMPANIES. WE WANT THE GENERIC INDUSTRY TO THRIVE BY GETTING ITS PRODUCT ON THE MARKET AND SELLING CONSUMERS. IF THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SURVIVE IS TO GET PAID BY OUR COMPETITORS TO STAY OFF THE MARKET. THAT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR THAT INDUSTRY. SURE -- I THINK GO AHEAD SO I CHAU JOHNSON FOR THE AND I PRESS SECTION OF THE AG'S OFFICE ARE BILL SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS PRO COMPETITIVE -- PAPER DELAY AGREEMENTS IT'S SIMPLY SHIFTS THE BURDEN IS TO SHOW THAT CONSUMERS ARE BENEFITTED BY THAT PARTICULAR AGREEMENT. I KNOW THE MENTIONED THE HUMANE TREATMENT. AND AND CITED THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A POSSIBLE PRO COMPETITIVE AGREEMENT. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS ANY PAYMENT AND THIS SO THIS BILL WOULD NOT REALLY. IMPACT AN AGREEMENT WHERE THE PARTIES HAVE LOOKED AT THE PATENTS AND MADE. OF THE STATE THAT THE PATENTS AND SETTLED THIS DOESN'T PREVENT THAT AT ALL THE FACT THIS ENCOURAGES THE PARTIES TO SETTLE ON THOSE LINES WITHOUT PAYING OKAY -- BUT I THINK THAT THEY KNOW THE THE BILL ENCOMPASSES THE DESIRE. TO TO ALLOW PRO COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR WOULD AND AVOID ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR BY THE EXEMPTION THAT'S IN THERE BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE -- YOU MISTER WOULD TO WORK WITH THE GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND MAKE SURE THAT HERE'S ENOUGH LATITUDE IN THE PROOF PROVISIONS OF THE EXEMPTION -- THAT THEY HAVE THE ROOM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS GET THE BENEFIT OF EARLY ACCESS TO GENERIC DRUGS AND WE WOULDN'T WANT TO STAND IN THE WAY THAT. YOU AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION IN YOUR COMMENTS AND I ABSOLUTELY WILL CONTINUE IN THAT IN THAT DIRECTION. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY -- IS ACTUALLY A WHOLE NOTHER LAYER OF THE ONION THAT THAT THAT WE COULD PEEL OFF BUT WE'RE NOT AND THAT'S AROUND THE PATENTS AND THERE ARE PATENTS THEIR FILE BETTER WE CALL WEAK PATENTS. THAT MAKE IT -- AND THAT REALLY OBSTACLES -- FOR EVERYONE -- THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO FIGHT THEY'RE EXPENSIVE -- AND THEY AND THEY PROTECT THE BRAND NAME EVEN MORE AND SO WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSED ON ONE ONE ISSUE HERE AND THAT IS THESE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE OR NOT. OR ANTI COMPETITIVE -- ACTIVITIES AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE FOLKS ON HERE BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S GOOD FOR CONSUMER WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR FUTURE LEGISLATION ON THAT TOPIC. MY SECOND QUESTION IS FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE AG IS GONNA BE EMPOWERED UNDER THIS BILL TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. BUT THERE'S ALSO A PART OF THE BILL. THAT GIVES THIRD PARTIES THE ABILITY TO SUE UNDER THE UNFAIR PRACTICES ACT. A FOUR DAY ADDITIONAL DAMAGES I'M WONDERING WHY THAT'S IN THERE BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THE UNIVERSE OF DRUG MANUFACTURERS BEING SO SMALL THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE VENUE TO BRING SUIT AND TO ENFORCE THE MEASURES OF THE BILL. WELL CERTAINLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CANNOT BE EVERYWHERE AND THEY CANNOT GO AFTER A LIVE THESE AGREEMENTS. EVEN WITH THIS BILL THESE CASES ARE GOING TO BE EXTREMELY RESOURCE INTENSIVE -- TAKE THE EXAMPLE THE FTC OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. LAST NINE YEARS AS ONLY BROUGHT FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THEY TYPICALLY HAVE TO HAVE. THIRTY FIVE ATTORNEY SAID EVEN THOUGH WE'VE ADJUSTED THE BURDEN OF PROOF THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE. IS SUBSTANTIAL EXPERTISE AND YEARS OF LITIGATION WE HAVE JUST CHANGED. SAME FIELD SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN. AND SO WE STILL ANTICIPATE THAT WHAT EVER ENFORCEMENT IS DONE BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. IS GOING TO NEED TO BE SUPPLEMENTED BY PRIVATE LITIGANTS. YEAH BUT THIS -- DOES NOT ALTER THE PENALTIES AT THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER THE HEART RIGHT AFTER. THE UNFAIR PRACTICES OKAY SO. IF I COULD I FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID -- YOU KNOW ONE THING TO ALSO CONSIDER ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT -- CURRENTLY UNDER CURRENT LAW THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION EXISTS AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF LAW IS REALLY THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE THAT'S INVOLVED AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A HANDFUL OF ATTORNEYS THAT COULD BRING THIS TYPE OF CASE THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN PATENT LAW AND ANTI TRUST LAW AND REALLY GET AS AS OF MY COLLEAGUE NOTE NOTED THE EXPENSE OF THESE CASES REALLY IT'S IT'S VERY FEW TYPES OF PLAINTIFFS -- THAT CAN BRING THIS KIND OF ACTION SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE KIND OF PLAYER IF. IN RATHER IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT TYPE OF PLAYER FOR ASIAN OF THESE AGREEMENTS WE WE NEED THE ABILITY FOR THEIR TO BE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN BRING -- BECAUSE IS AS MISS JOHNSON NOTED ON THERE THERE'S NO WAY FOR GOVERNMENT TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ALL THE TIME. RIGHT SO. THE WHOLE REASON FOR HAVING A BILL LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THERE TO BE A PROFIT MOTIVE TO KEEP GENERIC DRUGS OFF THE MARKET. BUT LIKE WHY IS -- I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO CREATE A PROFIT MOTIVE FOR PREDATORY LAW FIRMS. TO GO RAKE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS WHO AREN'T BEING ANTI COMPETITIVE OVER THE COALS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE UNFAIR PRACTICES ACT THERE ARE A LOT OF LAW FIRMS THAT ARE GOOD ACTORS IN THAT RESPECT AND THERE ARE A FEW THAT. ACTIVELY GO OUT AND SEEK THESE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVE NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE THE PLAYING FIELD FOR CONSUMERS. SO -- IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AG DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GO AFTER. THE THE THEY IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS THAT WE THINK ARE BEING ABUSIVE I WOULD LIKE US TO GIVE YOU MORE RESOURCES TO DO THAT RATHER THAN TO RELY ON PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER APART SO. I MEAN IF IF I VOTED AGAINST THE BILL THIS WOULD BE THE REASON BECAUSE I'M A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO I'M GONNA SUPPORTER TODAY I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU. ASSEMBLYMAN WOULD TO AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER -- TONING THAT PART OF THE BILL DOWN BECAUSE I WOULD I THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S THE APPROPRIATE VENUE TO BRING SUIT TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS THE BILL. BUT I THINK YOU I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION DOES EXIST ALREADY -- AND THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKELY BRING SUIT OTHER THAN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR PEOPLE LIKE EMPLOYERS -- PAYERS -- LABOR UNIONS -- HARDLY YOU KNOW CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT -- TYPE THINGS AND PARTLY BECAUSE THE COST OF LITIGATING THESE IS SO HIGH IT MAY COST FIVE TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN EXPERT WITNESSES ALONE TO TRY CASES LIKE THIS. SO THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF CASE THAT IS GOING TO BE -- BROUGHT WITH FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THESE ARE THESE ARE REALLY DIFFICULT CASES -- TO UNRAVEL AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO CHANGE THE BURDEN OF PROOF HERE. ON THIS AD TO SAY YOU KNOW THESE ARE NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE AGREEMENTS THEN THEN SHOW US INSTEAD OF HIDING BEHIND -- THE EGGS THE THE CURRENT THE CURRENT STATUS QUO AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO SHIFT THIS PENDULUM -- IN FAVOR OF CONSUMERS -- WERE IT CLEARLY ISN'T RIGHT NOW I THINK WELL I I RESPECT YOUR OPTIMISM THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ABUSED BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT HAS BEEN ABUSED. IN OTHER VENUES AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT BUT I THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD WORK ON THE BILL. WELL WHILE WE'RE BASHING ATTORNEYS I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT WHAT WAS. WHAT WAS MENTIONED THERE THE THESE THE HIGH PRICE PREDATORY ATTORNEYS OFTEN HAPPEN ON THE SIDE OF THE VERY LARGE DRUG COMPANIES HERE BECAUSE? UNFORTUNATELY THE PATENT LAWS HAVE OFTEN BEEN USED. STRATEGICALLY PAT PROSECUTION IS USED TO TEACH ECCLES BY THE HIGH PRICE LAW FIRMS IN ORDER TO ENFORCE REINFORCED A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE MARKETPLACE WHAT THIS BILL DOES BECAUSE WERE SHIPPING IT. TO ANTI TRUST IS BALANCE SOME OF THAT OUT BECAUSE THE LARGE CORPORATIONS WITH THE LARGE BANK ACCOUNTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO STRATEGICALLY GO AFTER. VERY SMALL PATTON'S IS A WAY OF BLOCKING ANYBODY ELSE FROM GETTING INTO THE GENERIC MARKET. THAT'S THE COMPLEXITY OF OF PATENT LAW SO YOUR COMPLAINT IS ACTUALLY MORE HAS BEEN MORE ABUSED ON THE SIDE OF PAT PROSECUTION. AS OPPOSED TO PATENT. ENFORCEMENT FOR SMALL COMPANIES TRYING TO FIND THEIR THEIR NICHE. SO MS GONZALEZ AND THEN AS PETRIE-NORRIS IN THE MISTER CHILD. THE CHAIR OF HELP ME UNDERSTAND MY QUESTION MORE AND I'M ALWAYS A CLEAR WHEN I DON'T. UNDERSTAND A PORCH IN THE LAW. I DON'T REMEMBER LEARNING THIS IN LAW SCHOOL I MIGHT HAVE SLEPT THROUGH THIS PORTION -- IT'S VERY DENSE AND I'M SMART ENOUGH TO ADMIT WHEN I DON'T KNOW SOMETHING SELMA START WITH THAT -- NO EXPERIENCS Là THE VALUES I UNDERSTAND I'M WITH YOU I SECOND I'M GONNA VOTE WITH US. BUT I'M TRYING TO GET TO WHAT CAN OR MAYBE IS BEING TALKED ABOUT BEING FIXED AND ONE OF MY QUESTIONS -- HAD TO DO I MEAN MAYBE I UNDERESTIMATED -- OR MAYBE OVER ESTIMATE WHAT TAKES TO GET A PATENT BUT IT HAS TO WITH THE PRESUMPTION OF VALIDITY OF THE PATENT. I UNDERSTAND THE REASON THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR BUT? I AID DON'T. UNDERSTAND THE VILLAGE DIDN'T YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME LIKE. MAYBE I SHOULD BE ASKING NO GO AHEAD OKAY MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER SHE'S GOT THE ANSWER OKAY. SO WHY WHY IS THAT NECESSARY FOR THE JUDGE AND JURY THE THE PRESUMPTION OF VALIDITY THE POUND. SURE -- AND AND GOSH I HOPE YOU NEVER FELL ASLEEP IN ANY OF ANY OF MY CLASSES IN IT OR AYE AYE MIGRATED ACTUALLY FALSELY BUT THIS IS REALLY I MEAN TO TRY TO GET TO THE LEGAL ISSUES HERE IS REALLY. NOT MY SPECIALTY I'M ALWAYS I'LL BUT TALK ABOUT LABOR LAW EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK BUT THERE WAS ONLY START WITH THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW IN THE TOXICITY CLEA -- ABOUT THAT THE THE PRESUMPTIONS IN THE BILL -- ARE THERE TO HELP THE COURTS TO GET TO WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND THAT IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO PAY YOUR COMPETITOR TO STAY OFF THE MARKET. YOU NEED TO SHOW US THAT THERE IS A GOOD PROGRAM HEADED OF REASON TO DO IT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE LOSS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. AND THE YOU KNOW THAT THAT SWEEPS ASIDE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT COURTS HAVE GOTTEN CONFUSED ABOUT. I BUT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS YOUR YOUR ISSUE ABOUT PATENTS -- BECAUSE THE SYSTEM FOR RAPID ENTRY OF GENERIC DRUGS WAS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE GENERIC DRUG COMPANIES TO DO BATTLE AGAINST THE BIG GUNS. AND CONGRESS RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PATENTS OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT VALID AND THEY'RE A LOT FANS OUT THERE THAT MAY BE VALID BUT DON'T APPLY TO PARTICULAR GENERIC DRUGS. SO THERE ARE -- OF INCENTIVES CREATED WITHIN THE LAW TO PUSH GENERICS AMOUNT OF THESE CHALLENGES IN COURT. NOW THE BRAND DRUG COMPANIES HAVE FOUND IN AND RUN ABOUT THEM DON'T DON'T FIGHT IT OUT IN COURT -- WIFI TO NURSING COURT JUST JUST PAY THEM HANDSOMELY AND THEN LET THEM AGREE TO STAY OFF THE THE MARKET. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IF ALL PATENTS WERE GOOD AND SOLID. WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM ALL RIGHT. SO WE JUST HAND OUT PATENTS ARE. ANYTHING AT THE AYE I DIDN'T KNOW THIS THIS IS OUR YEAH WELL SO. IT'S GOOD TO KNOW. AND HAVE IT ANSWERED BY MAYBE MORE ON A PASSING ANYONE EVER WANTS TO KNOW. WELL I THINK THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE DRUGS WHICH CLAIMED THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX PATENTS THAT COVER. A SINGLE DRUG SUGGEST YOU THAT MAY BE TOO MANY PATENTS SERBIAN ISSUED OR MAYBE TOO MANY. ARE BEING USED TO CLAIM PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG WE HAVE -- INSTANCES WHERE YOU HAVEN'T AND CHAPTER FOR INSTANCE SENDING CHECKS AT THE NORTH FROM MARK INSULIN. AND YET EACH OF THOSE LITTLE NEEDLES THAT HAVE BEEN IN USE FOR FOR YEARS MAY HAVE FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PATENTS THAT THEY CLAIM. COVER VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEM SO THESE PATENTS ARE OFTEN VERY NARROW AND THE GENERIC CAN WORK AROUND THEM OR DOESN'T INFRINGE THEM BUT YET THEY CLOG. THE THEY STOP COMPETITION SO THAT THE SCHEME OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL LAWS WAS TO ENCOURAGE THE GENERICS. WHO BEST KNOW WHAT THOSE PATENT WHICH PANTS ARE GOOD WHICH ONES COVER WHAT THEY MIGHT DO? TO CHALLENGE THE PATENTS AND FREE THEM FREE UP THE MARKET PLACE FOR OTHERS TO IT FOR GENERIC ENTRY [inaudible] BUT LETTER TO I I WILL I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE -- AS WELL WELL IT'S A SIMILAR PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE PATENT SYSTEM AND OUR COMPANY IS THE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS ARE CONSTANTLY. DOING BATTLE IN COURT AGAINST OUR FOR OUR FRIENDS FROM THE THE BRANDED SIDE OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE DOZENS OF PATENTS THAT ARE AT STAKE. IN THE MOST MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY DRUGS THESE PATENTS COST. WHAT'S BEEN ESTIMATED BY THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT TO BE BETWEEN. A MILLION AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER PATENT TO PROSECUTE IT'S ENORMOUSLY EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR SO WE HEAR ACCUSATIONS THAT OUR COMPANIES ARE LAYING DOWN AND LETTING THEMSELVES BE BRIBED. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH WE GO TO COURT WE SPENDING NORMAIS LEGAL FEES BUT SOMETIMES AS IN AND ANY OTHER TYPE OF LITIGATION THE THE BETTER COURSE OF VALOR RATHER THAN. BOTH -- THE BRAND COMPANIES IN THE GENERIC COMPANIES CHURNING OUT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LEGAL FEES IS TO SETTLE. THE QUESTION HERE IS. DO WE WANT THERE TO BE FAIR SETTLEMENTS ARE NOT AND IF WE DO IF WE WANT SETTLEMENTS THAT WILL ACTUALLY BRING DRUGS TO MARKET BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF PATENTS. WE CAN'T PUT SUCH A PRESUMPTION THAT THE SETTLEMENTS ARE ILLEGAL SUCH THAT THESE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE CHILLED. AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS UNDER THIS BILL. THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T HAVE TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS DELAY GENERIC ENTRY THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT. AND THAT SOMETHING OF VALUE NO MATTER HOW SMALL WENT TO THE GENERIC AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN YOU'RE FACED WITH ENORMOUS. INCLUDING PRIVATE RIGHT OF INCENTIVES NOT TO SETTLE. SO THAT'S A PRESUMPTION THAT'S REBUTTABLE. THANKS BYE AS SOMEBODY WHO PUTS A LOT OF REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION Là I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE WITH. WITH WHAT'S BEEN DONE HERE I'M SICK OF IT YES THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARD OTHER THAN -- I JUST. ONE COMMENT ONE QUICK FINAL QUESTION. AS IT SEEMS TO ME WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE MORE I HEAR AS THIS ISSUE WAS PRESENTED. FROM ALL SIDES THAT -- THAT THERE'S A LOT OF JUST GET YOU YOU GUYS ARE ENGAGED IN A GAME. I'M LARGELY. AS OF A GENERIC WANTING TO SUE SO THAT THEY CAN BE FIRST IN LINE. WHEN THE PATENT EXPIRES IN HAVE EIGHT TIMES BY WHICH THEY'RE THE FIRST GENERIC CAM I MEAN THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE? THAT IT'S A FINANCIAL MOTIVE AS WELL TO DO THESE LAWSUITS AND THAT'S WHAT THE FEDERAL LAW CREATED I I UNDERSTAND AND SO THE FEDERAL LAW SEEMS VERY MESSED UP IN CREATED LIKE A GAME THAT'S BEING PLAYED OUT IN COURTS AND SETTLEMENTS AND THAT'S I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET. IT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. TRYING TO BREAK THIS DOWN FOR THE FOLKS AT HOME -- THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S HAPPENING ON ALL SIDES IN IN BECAUSE OF FEDERAL LAW IS WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS KIND OF THIS -- THIS BEHAVIOR THAT. GAMES A SYSTEM FOR EVERY BUT AGAIN FOR EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE CONSUMER. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS LAW AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTIVE BUT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION I HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR STILL THINGS WERE WORKING ON AND POSSIBLY CAN WORK ON I WOULD SAY FROM THE PROPONENTS WHAT DO YOU. DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY THAT THERE IS STILL THINGS WE CAN WORK ON TO TO HELP MOVE THIS BILL AND WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS. HI DOCTOR WOULD MAYBE YEAH I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO WORKING TO WORKING ON THIS I THINK THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS. THE PENDULUM HAS BEEN SO FAR IN FAVOR OF THE DRUG COMPANIES -- THROUGH THE FTC PROCESS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SHIFT IT THE OTHER WAY SO WE'RE GOING TO FAR I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TO LISTEN TO THAT AND AND AND LOOK FOR A RESOLUTION THERE. BUT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT MAYBE THE CONSUMER GETS THE UPPER HAND OR AT LEAST GET A FAIR SHAKE AND I THINK WE'VE HAD A FAIR SHAKE FOR A LONG LONG TIME. SO IF THERE'S AN ISSUE OUT THERE THAT IS BEING WORKED ON IT HASN'T BEEN NIGHT YOU HAVEN'T FOUND ONE YET IDENTIFIED THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON WILL WE I I HAVEN'T CAN I HAVEN'T FELT WOULD BE A NEW ISSUE THAT. THEY BRING UP FROM THE BILL THAT WOULD BE WORKED ON OKAY I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR AS THIS MOVES BECAUSE EXPECTATIONS. I'VE LEARNED YES VERY IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS TO BE IN THE SAME PLACE MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE IF THERE IF THERE ARE REASONABLE -- PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO US THAT DO NOT WEEKEND THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ABSOLUTELY WE WILL CONSIDER THEM [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS PETRIE-NORRIS AND THEN MR CHAU. I THINK I'M ONE OF TWO NON LAWYERS ON THIS COMMITTEE SO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE SO. IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY THE OPPOSITION ASSERTS THAT THIS BILL IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S RELIVE RECENT TEST. AND CLEARLY THE THE AUTHOR IN THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL. I DISCONNECT CAN YOU HELP I GUESS CALPERS HELP ME WRAP MY MIND AROUND -- I GUESS. IN WHY THERE'S THAT THAT DISCONNECTED INTERPRETATION AND WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. TO RESOLVE THAT. CERTAINLY SO -- FILL THERE ISN'T THERE ISN'T A CONFLICT BETWEEN RULE OF REASON LAW AND WHAT THE BILL DOES. THE BILL LOOKS AT WHO BEARS WHAT BURDENS AS THAT LAW PLAYS OUT THE QUESTION IN A RULE OF REASON. IS IS THERE A PRO COMPETITIVE BENEFIT THAT STILL IN THE BILL IT'S STILL FOLLOWS BOTH THE FEDERAL ANTI TRUST LAW AND CALIFORNIA'S STATE ANTITRUST LAW. THEY'RE THERE TO SYSTEMS FOR ANTI TRUST AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO EXIST AND THAT THEY HAD THEY ARE DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS CALIFORNIA'S IS ACTUALLY OLDER THAN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM -- BUT NONE OF THIS CHANGES THE BASIC NOTION THAT WERE ASKING IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS IS THERE A PRO COMPETITIVE REASON AND ASKING THAT THE COMPANY'S PROOF THAT. AND HOW DOES THAT DIFFER FROM. YOUR INTERPRETATION AND THE ACTIVISTS DECISION THE SUPREME COURT AND A DECISION THAT WAS -- AUTHORED BY JUSTICE PRIOR. UP REJECTED. AN AUTOMATIC PRESUMPTION THAT A SETTLEMENT BETWEEN A BRAND AND GENERIC IS AUTOMATICALLY ANTI COMPETITIVE THEY SAID THAT SUCH A PRESUMPTION WAS APPROPRIATE QUOTE ONLY WHERE AN OBSERVER WITH EVEN A RUDIMENTARY UNDERSTANDING OF ECONOMICS. COULD CONCLUDE THAT THE ARRANGEMENT QUESTION. WOULD HAVE AN ANTI COMPETITIVE A FACT ON CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS AND QUOTE. AND SO WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HELD WAS THAT IF THERE IS SUCH A SETTLEMENT THAT. THERE THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE BURDEN TO PROVE THAT IT WAS ANTI COMPETITIVE BECAUSE SOME OF THESE SETTLEMENTS XCELERATED GENERIC ACCESS AND AND AND ONLY A SMALL NUMBER DO NOT. THIS BILL -- REJECTS WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HELD AND INCLUDES A PRESUMPTION THAT IS ONLY REBUTTABLE BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE WHICH IS A VERY HIGH STANDARD -- THAT. A WHOLE BOLUS OF SETTLEMENTS THAT. THE F. T. C. HAS FOUND ARE FINE BECAUSE THE F. T. C. AUTOMATICALLY GETS THE DETAILS OF ALL OF THEM -- IT THAT IT JUST -- CREATES A DIFFERENT STANDARD. AND THE IT'S NOT THAT THE YOU KNOW FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS RIGHT AND STATE THROW IS WRONG BUT THIS IS A SHARP DEPARTURE. FROM WHAT THE FTC HAS BEEN DOING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WHICH HAS RESULTED IN. THE AN EXTREME SMALL AMOUNT OF OF SETTLEMENTS THAT HAVE VALUE GOING TO GENERICS. SIX THEN YOU WOULD ASSERT THAT JUST THE NOTION OF A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION IN THIS ARENA. IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE RESERVE REPORT EXPRESSLY REJECTED THAT. THIS READ. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY FIRST I THINK THE BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FTC PROCESS -- THE FTC ACTION ON THEIR WEBSITE -- INDICATES THEY WANT LEGISLATION ON THIS ISSUE -- SECOND -- THE CURRENT WE IT THE FTC PROCESS ALLOWS FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SO THIS IS NOT THERE'S NOT INCONSISTENT. I THINK THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT -- THERE IS PREEMPTION ON THIS ISSUE BY CLAIMING INCONSISTENCY WITH THE FTC PROCESS I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THAT HERE TODAY. LET ME TELL YOU THERE'S NO PRE EMPTION HERE -- CALIFORNIA HAS LONG AND HAD A HISTORY OF ADOPTING A STRONGER ANTI A TRUST LIKE LEGISLATION AND WE'RE COMPLETE WITHIN OUR RIGHTS TO DO SO -- TO HAVE STRICTER RULES STRICTER LAWS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE DO THAT ON A NUMBER ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES -- SO I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ANTICOMPLY ID THAT IS IN CONFLICT -- WITH THE SUPREME COURT IN ANYWAY I THINK IT ACTUALLY THEY ACTUALLY GO SIGNED THEY GO SIDE BY SIDE. WELL AND I'M. JUST MAYBE TO ANSWER THEM PLUS A QUESTION THERE. WERE FULLY WITHIN OUR RIGHTS AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO NOT AGREE WITH THE SUPREME COURT AND SET OUR OWN STANDARDS. I MIGHT ALSO NOTE THAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF THESE PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS. AND HAS TAKEN A DIFFERENT APPROACH FROM THE US SUPREME COURT IT HAS FOUND. AGREEMENTS ARE VERY HARMFUL TO CONSUMER AND HAS URGED TO STANDARD THAT IS MUCH MORE STRIPPED. AND HAS URGED MORE ROBUST ENFORCEMENT RECOGNIZING THE FRAILTIES THAT THE ACT OF THIS DECISION. RIGHT THIS IS THAT YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU WITH A CHOP. I'M I'M WONDERING WHETHER ANYBODY CAN ACTUALLY CAN SHARE WITH US EITHER -- AN EXAMPLE OR A CASE. WITH FACTS THAT WOULD -- SHOW A STAT THE PRESUMPTION CAN BE REBUTTED EITHER IN TERMS OF THE VALUE BEING FAIR OR HAVING THE PRETTY COMPETITIVE BENEFITS -- OF THE OUT WAIT YOU KNOW. ALL WEATHER WISE. WELL I KNOW IT'S A I KNOW IT'S FACTUAL I KNOW IT'S A YOU KNOW EVERYTHING'S CASE BY CASE BUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR EXAMPLE THAT COULD BE USED IN THE WEIGHING OF THE A THE BALANCING OF THE OF THE TO DO YOU. KNOW THE TWO PROBLEMS WITH THE THREE PROBLEMS WELL FOR INSTANCE LET'S SAY THE GENERIC DRUG COMPANY HAS PURCHASED -- AN INVENTORY OF ACTIVE INGREDIENT FROM THE BRAND COMPANY. SO THE BRAND COMPANY MAY BE. THIS IS SO SO THERE'S PAYMENT BUT THE COMPANIES CAN SHOW THAT THERE IS VALUE FOR THAT PAYMENT REASONABLE VALUE FOR THAT PAYMENT -- SO THAT IS NOT PAID FOR DELAY IT'S PAY FOR SOME ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT OR SERVICES AND IT'S A REASONABLE -- APPROXIMATION OF THE VALUE OF THAT PRODUCT OR SERVICES THAT'S BEING. SHARED BETWEEN THE COMPANIES. SO THAT'S THE CASE WERE TO VALUE COULD BE DEEMED FAIR. IN THAT PARTICULAR CONTEXT IN RIGHT AND IT WOULD BE UP TO THE DRUG COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH THAT THAT WAS WHAT WAS TRULY HAPPENING. TYPICALLY IN THESE CASES THE DRUG COMPANIES DON'T PROVIDE DOCUMENTS AS TO WHAT ACTUALLY WENT ON IN THESE AGREEMENTS. THEY WITHHOLD THE DOCUMENTS AS PRIVILEGED SO IT IT CREATES A VACUUM OF EVIDENCE WHICH GIVES AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE TO TO THE DRUG COMPANIES AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE BILL DOES HERE. IS TO ALIGN THAT PRESUMPTION WITH THE PERSON WHO POSSESSES THE EVIDENCE THAT WILL BE A JURY QUESTION. THAT WOULD BE A JURY QUESTION QUICK QUESTION FOR THE JURY TO ANSWER IS FACTUAL QUESTION ESSENTIAL YES OKAY. THANK YOU. IF I COULD RESPOND I THINK THAT THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHERE THERE SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR CARVE OUT. FROM A VERY STRONG PRESUMPTION AND I AGREE WITH THE ETERNAL GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT -- IN THAT CASE WHERE THERE IS A FAIR MARKET VALUE EXCHANGE OF GOODS OR SERVICES -- THERE SHOULD BE A THERE SHE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FACE. THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT THAT THIS. BILL WOULD PUT INTO A FACT AND SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOVE TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE WITH THE SPONSOR WOULD BE A TO HAVE SOME VERY. CLEAR SAFE HARBOR SAID THAT -- HE IS SO THAT COMPANIES WHO DON'T WANT TO TAKE A RISK OF HAVING TO GO TO COURT AND FACE ENORMOUS LIABILITY. CAN STILL BRING ABOUT SETTLEMENTS -- INCLUDING THAT THE PROVISION THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE JUST TALKED ABOUT -- WHERE THEY THEY KNOW VERY CLEARLY WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO COURT -- THAT THEY ARE ACTING CONSISTENTLY WITH THE LAW. SEARCH THANK YOU OTHER. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT. SEEING NONE MISTER WOULD YOU MAKE CLOTHES FIRST WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS ROBUST DISCUSSION -- I LOST MY NOTES -- FOR DECADES WE'VE HAD A RICH TRADITION HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- PROHIBITING ANTI COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY AND THIS -- WITH THE CAR RIGHT ACT ON THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT LOVE LITIGATING PATENT INFRINGEMENT THIS IS ABOUT -- SIMPLY CAR FIND A PARTICULAR BURDEN OF PROOF -- FOR THE CONSUMER IF IT WERE NOT SO DIFFICULT TO GET THIS INFORMATION TO THE CURRENT FTC PROCESS WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY.

YES WELCOME THANK ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN AB. SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY IMPRISONING AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE TO SUPPORTER STATES COASTAL CITIES -- THAT ARE WRESTLING WITH BEST PRACTICES FOR ONLY A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL COMPANIES -- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR AND IS WONDERFUL STUFF REALLY THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE ON THIS BILL. AND I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT THIS BILL WITH A MOMENT AMENDMENTS WE'VE AGREED UPON -- AND I LIKE TO BE CLEAR WHAT THESE AMENDMENTS ARE AS AMENDED AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE IS A DISTRICT BILL. IT ALLOWS A HOW HOSTING PLATFORM TO LIST A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY WITH AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES COASTAL ZONE. AS A SHORT TERM RENTAL YEAR ROUND SO LONG AS THE PRIMARY RESIDENT LIVES ON SITE THE MAJORITY OF THE YEAR. IT AUTHORIZES EACH HOUSING PLATFORM TO RENT A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY FOR THIRTY DAYS PER YEAR IF THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE IS NOT ON SITE. AND IT ALLOWS THE PROPERTY TO BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR YEAR ROUND AS A SHORT TERM RENTAL IF PROVIDING LOW COST ACCOMMODATION ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN THE COASTAL ZONE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. IS REALLY EVERY CITY CAN REGULATE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS WITHIN THEIR OWN PER VIEW UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE COASTAL ZONE. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COASTAL ZONE IS REALLY FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS ARE REMOVING HOUSING FROM OUR HOUSING STOCK. AND THIS IS CAUSING AN INCREASE IN LONG TERM RENTAL PRICES AND REMOVING LONG TERM RENTALS FROM OUR MARKET. THAT'S INCREASING GENTRIFICATION AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE TYPICALLY HAD YOU KNOW DOCTORS LIVING NEXT TO A TEACHER LIVING NEXT -- TO A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND THIS IS AN ACUTE PROBLEM AN AREA WHERE IT IS DIFFICULT TO BUILD HOUSING AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS ADDRESSING -- HOW DO YOU DRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS? SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS WE ARE NOT TRYING TO BAN ANY SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL WE'RE SAYING HOW DO YOU PROPERLY AND APPROPRIATELY REGULATE. THE ONES THAT ARE REMOVING HOUSING FROM THE HOUSING STOCK SO YOU STILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE COAST YOU'RE STILL PROVIDING LOW COST ACCOMMODATION BUT YOU'RE PREVENTING THIS REMOVAL THE HOUSING STOCK THAT'S MASSIVELY HURTING OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO -- THE MEMONS ALSO CLARIFY THIS BILL MILLER CIRCUMVENT NOR PRECLUDED CITIES EXISTING OR PERSPECTIVE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL ORDINANCE AND I THINK THAT WAS A KEY AMENDMENT WE GOT FROM THE CHAIR AND STUFF THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE. THAT THE ALL THE REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY NEGOTIATED WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION THAT ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN OUR ORNETTE OUR OUR SUGGESTION. THEY STAY IN PLACE. AND ABOVE ALL THIS IS REGULATING THE POP FORMS SO WE'RE NOT TOUCHING AND A BIT ANYBODY'S INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT WEBSITE TO LIST THEIR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL. RIGHT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET IS THE CRUX OF THIS PROBLEM WHERE THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION OF RENTING OUT A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL FULL TIME THAT HAS AN INDIVIDUAL BENEFIT. BUT IT DESTROYS THE COMMUNITY IN ITS ENTIRETY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET OUT WITH -- THIS BILL AND IN THE MIDST OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE WHEN HOUSING CRISIS THE HOUSING SHORTAGES PARTICULAR CUTE IN THE COASTAL ZONE CITIES FACE COMPOUNDING VARIOUS TO REGULATING SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. WHEN SINGING TO MINIMIZE OR REGULATE THE NUMBER OF THESE RENTALS IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS? THERE IS A SPIKE IN SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS -- UNITS REDUCES THE AVAILABILITY AVAILABILITY OF ALREADY SCARCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN MANY COASTAL COMMUNITIES. AND ANY UNIT RESERVE RESERVE REMOVED FROM HIS OWN HOUSING STOCK IS DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. TO REPLACE AND I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE COASTAL ZONE FOR EXAMPLE ANTHONY IS THE CITY I'M FROM ABOUT THREE FORCE MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN THAT IS IN THE COASTAL ZONE. AND OTHER CITIES LIKE OCEANSIDE% IS JUST WEST OF THE ONE A ONE THEIR SMALLER AREAS -- AND CITIES IN CALIFORNIA NATION ONE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO STRIKE A BALANCE TO REGULATE ON MY VACATION RENTALS. FOR ALMOST A DECADE SHORT TERM PLATFORMS INTO AND THEIR OWN TELLING HAVE BEEN A RESOURCE FOR MIDDLE CLASS AN EXTRA SOURCE OF INCOME FOR FAMILIES IN NEED. FOR AN ECONOMIC VIEW A BOOST HOWEVER THE SHIFT IN THE INDUSTRY THOSE PROVIDING DETRIMENTAL SMALL RESIDENTIAL COMMITTEES WERE FOR DOUBLE RIGHT. HOUSING IS ALREADY CHALLENGING TO FIND. SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS -- BENEFITS PROPERTY OWNERS BUT THE COLLECTIVELY CREDIT TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS. THAT MAKING HOUSING AND HIGHLAND VALLEY AREAS EVEN MORE AFFORDABLE AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN'T TO EVERYBODY HOSTAGE DO THEIR FAIR SHARE IN ADDRESSING OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND THIS IS ONE OF ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. AND THE DECADES TWO MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ENTIRE HOMES THAT ARE BEING RENTED OUT FOR SHORT TERM STAYS. SHORT TERM RENTALS OF CREATED NEXUS BETWEEN TOURISM HOUSING THAT IN AREAS THERE ARE EXPENSING EXPERIENCING THE MOST PROFOUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING CHALLENGES. AND IT HURTS RENTERS. THE UCLA ANDERSON SCHOOL BUSINESS CONSIDERS LA'S COST OF HOUSING IN A SIGNIFICANT DRAG ON JOB CREATION THE NEARLY TEN THOUSAND UNITS TAKEN OFF THE RENTAL MARKET BY SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTY PLATFORMS. IS EQUIVALENT TO SEVEN YEARS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM WHEN THEY REMOVE FULL TIME -- IN VENICE ON AS MANY AS TWELVE POINT 5% OF ALL HOUSING UNITS HAVE BECOME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. WITHOUT PUBLIC APPROVALS THEN THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT -- THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS PER SQUARE MILE -- AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE COMBATS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES A SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS AND WE GIVE CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL CITIES COMMONSENSE TOOLS TO HELP INSURE ONLINE MENTAL PUFFINS ARE OPERATE WAY. THEY WERE INTENDED WHILE PRESERVING ACCESS TO THE COAST FOR SHORT TERM RENTALS. OTHER -- FOR PRIMARY RESIDENTS WHO LIVE ON SITE SO PEOPLE CAN RENT OUT ROOMS IN THEIR HOUSE IF THEY LIVE IN THE EIGHTY IN THE BACK THEY CAN STILL RUN OUT THE FRONT HOUSE. YOU'RE STILL PROVIDING THE ACCESS TO THE COAST AND THIS LEGISLATION CLEARLY ALSO SAYS -- THAT SAN DIEGO COUNTY WITH A SUNSET DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE HOUSING PLATFORM FACILITATOR OF THE SHORT TERM RENTAL TO COOK THE SAME TRANSIT ORIENTED TAX THAT. HOTELS ARE REQUIRED TO COLLECT TO ENSURE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE FAIRLY COMPENSATED FOR THE INCREASE PUBLIC SERVICE COST AND CONSERVE OUR INCURRED BY LOOK SERVINGS TOURISTS. OUR STATE HOUSING GOALS TO PROVIDE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION AND AFFORDABLE. AND ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS ON THE MARKET BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HOWEVER SHE HOUSING UNITS THAT WENT ON A SHORT TERM BASIS LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS AT A TIME FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. BY DEFINITION REMOVE THAT HOUSING STOCK AND OFTEN THIS IS A PERMANENT CONDITION. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS NOT A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. I ALSO THIS LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE TOOLS FOR COASTAL CITIES. JUMP POWER SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS THEY INTENDED. TO AND DID YOU TOUR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF REMOVING HOUSING FROM THE HOUSING STOCK AS EXPERIENCE OF COMMUNITY STRUGGLING TO GET BY. WITH ME TODAY AND SUPPORT WE HAVE DEAL CARLSON CO FOUNDER OF SHARE BETTER S. F.. IN CONSULTANT ON HOUSING POLICIES WITH A NUMBER OF LABOR AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS. AND JOHN CALDWELL. BUT THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION SO TURNED OVER TO THEM. THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE THIS SHERMAN JOHN CALDWELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION. MY JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THIS ISSUE WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. WHEN MOST PEOPLE THINK OF AIRBNB IN SHORT TERM RENTALS THEY THINK OF HOME SHARING -- THAT THE RETIRED COUPLE WHO LETS OUT THEIR HOUSE MAKE SOME MONEY SO THEY CAN PAY PAY OFF SOME DEBTS. HOME SHARING IS NOT A PROBLEM NOT TO US NOT TO THE AUTHOR. THE PROBLEM HERE IS WITH THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL CALLED COMMERCIAL USERS YEARS AGO WE GOT THE RECORDS FOR AIRBNB NEW YORK CITY HE FOUND A DISPROPORTIONATE -- NUMBER OF UNITS WERE OWNED BY THESE COMMERCIAL USERS HE FOUND FOR EXAMPLE TWELVE COMMERCIAL USERS OWNED EIGHT HUNDRED UNITS AND ACCOUNTED FOR TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN RENT ONE YEAR. THE AG FOUND THE COMMERCIAL USER REPRESENTED 6% OF AIRBNB HOSTS BUT ALMOST 40% OF THE REVENUE. THESE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES A BY UP APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND TURN THEM INTO ILLEGAL HOTELS. HE'S PERSONAL HOSE USERS PRESENT A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS ALL OF WHICH THIS BILL IS AIMED AT DEALING WITH. THIS CLEARLY HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HOUSING. APARTMENTS AND HOMES ARE BEING TAKEN OFF THE LONG TERM RENTAL MARKET. EIGHT A UNITE HERE OFFICIAL TOLD ME THAT HOTEL EMPLOYEES ALL OVER THE STATE ARE FINDING THEY HAVE TO MOVE FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS BECAUSE FORMALLY AFFORDABLE HOMES AND APARTMENTS WHEN A LONGER AVAILABLE. SO THE BILL LIMITS NOT BANDS FOR TERMINALS BY COMMERCIAL USERS IN ONE COUNTY IN THE COASTAL ZONE FOR A FEW YEARS. AND IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THE AUTHOR HAS WRITTEN THE BILL SO IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THOSE WHO JUST SHARE THEIR OWN HOMES. THEN THERE'S TAXES. ONE OF THE FEW REVENUE STREAMS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE WITHOUT LIMITS IS THE T. T. O. T. TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX OUR HOTELS AND BED AND BREAKFAST PAY THE DOT. WHICH IN PLACES. LIKE THE GERMANS -- THAT THE CHAIRS DISTRICT ARE AS HIGH AS SHORT TERM RENTALS SHOULD PAY THAT TAX AS WELL. BUT IN MOST CASES THEY DON'T PAY. THAT PUTS LEGITIMATE HOTELS IN BED AND BREAKFAST AT A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL IT COSTS 10% MORE TO STAY AT A HOTEL OR BED AND BREAKFAST. BUT IT ALSO DENIES CITIES AND COUNTIES. OF A LOT OF NEEDED REVENUE WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL MANDATES THE PLATFORMS COLLECT THAT TOT THAT SOLD. NOW THE OPPONENTS HAVE A NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS AGAINST THIS. FOR THE ALICE'S IT APPEARS THAT SOMEBODY IS ARGUING THAT IN SOME CASES A SHORT TERMINALS DON'T HAVE TO BE THE DOT. THAT ONE SURPRISE ME GENERALLY THEY DON'T ARGUE THAT PUBLIC -- OTHERS ARE ARGUING THAT ASKING FOR THE PLATFORMS TO COLLECT LEGALLY -- TAXES FROM THEIR HOST IS A TAX INCREASE. AN ARGUMENT THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RIGHTLY DISMISSED. THE ANALYSIS ALSO POINTS OUT THAT AIRBNB HAS NUMEROUS CONTRACTS WITH CITIES ALL OVER THE STATE IN WHICH THEY COLLECT YOUR TO FOR THE HOST. BUT HERE'S HOW THE DEAL WORKS AIRBNB WILL NEVER TELL THE THE RENTAL UNITS ARE I DO NEED YOU TO WRAP UP PLEASE. AIR TO AIRBNB WILL WILL NEVER TELL THE CITY OR COUNTY WHERE THE UNITS ARE LOCATED. THERE THE AIRBNB WILL SIMPLY WILL SIMPLY JUST SAY THIS IS% WHAT WE WE THINK. THAT THE THE T. O. T. FOR FOR THAT AREA IS IF YOU DON'T AGREE THAT YOU DON'T GET TO COLLECT THE DOT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE MOST SHORT TERM RENTALS DON'T PAY THEIR DOT AND THE MERE SUGGESTION THIS BILL THAT THE PLATFORM TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS PAID IS MET WITH I THINK. THE TOP ARGUMENTS. THANK YOU SIR. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS STILL CARLSON -- I AM THE A CO FOUNDER SHARE BETTER SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS AN ECLECTIC COALITION. OF HOTELS AND HOTEL WORKERS UNIONS. APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OWNERS APARTMENT OWNERS AND TENANT ORGANIZATIONS -- AND NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS FROM BOTH THE EAST AND THE WEST SIDE. OF TOWN AND THESE ORGANIZATIONS RARELY FIND AGREEMENT ON MUCH OF ANYTHING BUT ON ISSUES RELATED TO AIRBNB [inaudible] THEY DO. THEY SING FROM THE SAME HYMNAL. THE ISSUES ARE THE SAME FOR ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS AIRBNB IS DRAMATICALLY REDUCING. HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CITY. AND REDUCING THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING IN THE CITY. IF I CAME BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN. WITH A PROPOSAL TO DEMOLISH ELEVEN THOUSAND UNITS IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ALONE. AND NOT REPLACE THE YOU WOULD THINK I WAS A LITTLE NUTS. BUT THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT'S HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO. ELEVEN THOUSAND YEARS ALMOST ALL OF THEM IN THE COASTAL ZONE IN ALMOST ALL OF THEM RENTED FULL TIME. ON AIRBNB IN THE OTHER SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS. AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE SUFFERING THE WORST HOUSING. AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IS. CERTAINLY IN THE STATE'S HISTORY I THINK. THE SECOND SET OF ISSUES I WANT TALK ABOUT OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS THEY'RE BEING BE CLAIMS A CHORE TERMINALS BRING TO CITIES. IN SAN FRANCISCO OUR CITY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST LOOKED AT THE ISSUE. AND DETERMINE THAT FOR EVERY UNIT CONVERTED TO A FULL TIME SHORT TERM RENTAL THE CITY LOST. LOST. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING MERCHANTS DON'T SEE THE BENEFIT. OF TOURISTS IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. THEY MIGHT. EAT AT A RESTAURANT THEY MIGHT PICK UP A COCKTAIL IT UP IN A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR. BUT THERE'S NO USE THE DRY CLEANER THAN I USED TO COPY SHOP. THEY DON'T USE. GET A HAIR CUT. IS THAT IT IT IS HOLDING IT IT HURTS A NEIGHBORHOODS ECONOMY IT HURTS NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING MERCHANTS. AND THE LACK OF HOUSING MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE MERCHANTS TO FIND EMPLOYEES. THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE RECENTLY ISSUED A REPORT ON SHORT TERM RENTALS AND WHY THEY SHOULD BE REGULATED. AND THEY SAID THAT 224% OF THE MONEY AIRBNB CLAIMS TO BE GENERATING BY ITS TOURISTS COMING INTO CITIES. IS NEW MONEY IS FOUND MONEY. THE REST OF MONEY THAT WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN SPENT. BY PEOPLE COMING AND STAYING IN LEGITIMATE HOTELS. I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX REVENUES THAT THEY GENERATE FOR CITIES. BUT IN SAN FRANCISCO I'M IN THE LAST TIME. WE HAD ANY NUMBERS FROM AIRBNB WAS TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN THEY SAID THEY HAD GENERATED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN T. O. T. REVENUE. SAN FRANCISCO HOTELS GENERATE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN A BUDGET THAT'S SEVERAL BILLION IS IS SORT OF A DROP IN THE BUCKET. SO THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE INFLATED. THE IMPACT ON HOUSING AVAILABILITY IN ON AN AFFORDABILITY IS SEVERE IT'S SIGNIFICANT THIS LEGISLATURE'S WORKING OVERTIME TO FIND NEW WAYS. OF GENERATING AND STIMULATING HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER TO THE OREGON LINE. YOUR CHEEK BE EQUALLY ENERGETIC ABOUT EFFORTS TO PRESERVE HOUSES. BECAUSE THE MOST AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE. IS A HOUSING THAT ALREADY EXISTS WE CANNOT AFFORD. TO REPLACE THESE UNITS SO I URGE YOU TO EMBRACE THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE I DEBORAH CARL TO THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO YOUR SUPPORT. SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF UNITE HERE AND THE TEAMSTERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. YES MY NAME IS PETER READ ON A CROWD COME TO THE TABLE IF YOU LIKE. I'M SORRY YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME TO THE TABLE IF YOU LIKE YES. MY NAME IS EIGHT AND I'M A PROPERTY OWNER IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA -- WE HAVE DEALT WITH A PROPOSITION LAST YEAR THAT WAS PROPOSED -- TO HAVE A SWEEPING BAN OF SHORT TERM RENTALS KNOWN AS S. T. OURS -- I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THIS PROPOSITION BECAUSE OF THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS CITING THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE PROPERTY WE OWN IF ANYONE HEARS FAMILIAR WITH SAN DIEGO IS LOCATED IN MISSION BEACH SO TWO MILE STRETCH OF COASTAL COMMUNITY IN SAN DIEGO WHICH WAS INITIALLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE NAME OF TENT CITY BECAUSE IT THRIVED UNDER SHORT TERM. VACATION RENTALS AT THE TIME WHICH WERE MERELY TENTS WHICH REPLACED ON THE BEACH THAT IS INEFFECTIVE. A SHORT TERM RENTAL IT'S THE SAME AS A HOTEL -- THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAD INITIALLY ARGUED WITH THE INITIAL PROPOSAL THAT BY HAVING A SWEEPING BAN OF SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT WOULD LIMIT PUBLIC ACCESS. TO THE BEACH COMMUNITY -- MY PROPERTY THAT I PURCHASED -- WITHOUT GOING INTO SPECIFICS I DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A COST EFFECTIVE HOUSING TO SAY THE LEAST. I'M WE BOUGHT IT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS A SHORT TERM RENTAL WE STILL USED AS A SHORT TERM RENTAL WE HAVE BY USING IT AS A SHORT TERM RENTAL WE HAVE A ROTATING -- EMPLOYEES OF SIX TO EIGHT PEOPLE RANGING FROM PROPERTY MANAGERS WINDOW CLEANERS -- HOUSE CLEANERS-- THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE EMPLOYEE EVERY SINGLE WEEK TO TURN OVER THE PROPERTY TO ANOTHER RENTER. WE HAVE RENTERS THAT ARE ABLE TO STAY ON THE BEACH TWENTY STEPS FROM THE SAND THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD A PLACE TO STAY ALONG THE BEACH. THERE ARE ONLY FOUR HOTELS IN THE MISSION BEACH AREA WHERE ELSE ARE THE RENTERS OR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO COME VACATION SUPPOSED TO STAY. CALM THE IDEA THAT THEN THERE CAN BE -- THE I'D THE IDEA THAT THAT BY. HAVING THIS BROAD SWEEPING BAN WOULD SOMEHOW BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT APPLY TO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES IN SAN DIEGO WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AS LONG TERM SHORT TERM RENTALS -- THERE IS NO ONE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO RENT ON A MONTHLY BASIS THE PROPERTY THAT WE YOUNG. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EVEN AFFORD THE MORTGAGE AND THEREFORE EMPLOY THE SIX OTHER BUSINESSES IS BECAUSE WE ARE DOING IT AS A SHORT TERM RENTAL -- I BELIEVE THAT THE IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A BAN IN PLACE THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS IN SAN DIEGO LIKE IN ANY OTHER IN ANY OTHER CITY WHERE IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO CARVE IT OUT WHERE IT'S A COMMUNITY BASED WHERE THERE'S A SCHOOL. THERE IS NOT EVEN A ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN MISSION BEACH RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE TORN THAT DOWN IN A BUILDING CONDOS BECAUSE IT IS JUST KNOWN AS A VACATION. YOU GO TO VACATION THERE -- I WOULD REQUEST IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THERE SHOULD BE -- TIME TAKEN TO CONSIDER CARVING OUT CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS IF ANYONE HEARS MY WAS SEEN IT GO MISSION BEACH IS. KNOWN AS A BEACH TOWN AS A VACATION TOWN THERE ARE MORE -- AREAS FURTHER ALONG THE COAST SUCH AS THE PLAN WHICH EVEN THOUGH IS ALSO A BEACH TOWN. IS MORE OF A COMMUNITY BASED TOWN BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THE HOMES AND ALSO THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION'S YOU HAVE THERE. BUT AT A MINIMUM IF MISSION BEACH OR SOME OF THESE OTHER AREAS COULD BE CARVED OUT OF THIS IS AN EXCEPTION I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE WORTH. THREE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THAT'S WITH US PLEASE. A GOOD MORNING JOHN ROSS ON BEHALF OF AIRBNB I'M GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT ACCESS THE AFFORDABLE AFFORDABILITY IN HOUSING ISSUES WERE RAISED. TIED COLLECTION AND IF THERE'S TIME AT THE END SOME SIGNIFICANT WORKABILITY ISSUES WITH THE BILL. UP FIRST ON ACCESS -- THIS BILL WE'RE CONCERNED MAKES IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE NOT FORTUNE UP TO LIVE AT THE BEACH TO VISIT THE BEACH. THE COASTAL ACT REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO ASSURE ACCESS THE COMMISSION IS DETERMINED THAT THE COST OF OVERNIGHT ACCOMMODATIONS AS A BARRIER TO ACCESS AND FOR THAT REASON -- THE COMMISSION HAS REJECTED LOCAL PROPOSALS TO LIMIT -- SHORT TERM RENTALS IN COASTAL AREAS -- THAT HAD PERMISSIONS FAR MORE LIBERAL THAN WHAT IS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL -- THIS IS BECAUSE THE GAS. PARTICULARLY FAMILIES -- SEE SHORT TERM RENTALS AS THE WAY TO VISIT THE BEACH THE AVERAGE AT LEAST ON OUR PLATFORM FOR COASTAL RENTAL IS NINETY THREE THIRTY AT NIGHT. THAT'S THIRTY DOLLARS LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE -- COSTS FOR ACCOMMODATIONS RIGHT ALONG THE BEACH SO YOU KNOW PART OF THIS EQUATION IN THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS DONE GREAT WORK AROUND THIS IS TO UNDERSTAND. THE IMPACT OF RESTRICTIONS WELL INTENTIONED UPON THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE AT THE BEACH TO VISIT THE PAGE. SECOND ON AFFORDABILITY -- AND HOUSING ALTER AND BE RELATIVELY BRIEF ON THIS -- THE BAY AREA COUNCIL COMMISSIONED A STUDY -- ON HOME SURE IN SAN FRANCISCO THE LOOKED AT THE EXPERIENCE AND SAN FRANCISCO TO KEEP TAKE AWAY FROM THAT FIRST -- STRICT RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF A HOMEOWNER OR RENTER TO RENT THEIR UNIT. IS GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THAT PERSON TO PERSON TO AFFORD TO LIVE. I IT TAKES INCOME OUT OF THEIR POCKET THAT OTHERWISE COULD HELP THEM PAY RENT AND MEET OTHER EXPENSES -- THE ABILITY TO RENT A ROOM OR A HOUSE. FOR A WEEK AND IS USED BY HOST -- IN EXPENSIVE AREAS AT ROUGHLY RATE OF 32% -- STUDIES SHOW HI DOBSON RENT OR MORTGAGE OR OTHER OTHER EXPENSES. IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING -- WE THINK THE CONCERN IS GROSSLY OVERSTATED. TWO REASONS FIRST JUST THE SIMPLE ABOUT ECONOMICS -- IF YOU ARE BUYING A PROPERTY TO INVEST YOUR TRYING TO MAXIMIZE INVESTMENT RETURN. THE BEST WAY TO MAXIMIZE YOUR RETURN TO LEASE IT FOR A YEAR. THE BAY AREA COUNCIL STUDY SHOWED THAT FOR A SHORT TERM RENTAL TO EQUAL WHAT YOU WOULD GET ANY YEAR FOR EXAMPLE IN BERNAL HEIGHTS WITHOUT THE RENDON THREE OR NINETEEN NIGHTS. AT AVERAGE RATES TO BE RENTED -- IN THE MARINA AND COVER WHAT YOU GET FROM YOUR LEASE WOULD BE YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE HONORING SIXTEEN NIGHTS SO THE FACT IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AVAILING THEIR UNITS FOR SHORT TERM RENTALS ARE DOING IT FOR OTHER REASONS. THAN TO MAXIMIZE RIGHT THEY'RE NOT TAKING THESE UNITS UP THE MARKET THEIR USE IN EITHER MEET EXPENSES OR THEY'RE USING IT SO THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN A SECOND PROPERTY. AND AFFORD IT AND PAY THE MORTGAGE -- ONTO THE TRANSFER YOU ARE ABOUT OUT OF TIME. CAN I HIT ON ON THE POINTS OF THE OUT THAT THAT PROPONENTS MADE ABOUT THE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX PLEASE -- I'M SORRY SECONDS HERE. ALRIGHT I WILL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECONDS SURE WE CAME TO THIS LEGISLATURE FOUR YEARS AGO AND WE ENCOURAGE THE STATE WIDE SOLUTION THAT THESE FOLKS A PLUS. OPPOSED WHERE WE WOULD COLLECT THE TEN TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX ON ALL TRANSACTIONS THAT DIDN'T WORK FOR THEM. MORE IMPORTANTLY IT DIDN'T WORK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO WE CAN GO AND JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION CURRENTLY HAVE DEALS WITH FORTY CITIES EIGHTEEN COUNTIES WERE COLLECTING TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX. ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNITS ON OUR PLATFORM CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA THE IRONY OF THIS BILL IS A FOR A NUMBER OF CITIES LIKE SAN DIEGO LIKE CARLSBAD WHERE WE CURRENTLY HAVE AGREEMENTS. THIS WILL REDUCE THEIR TRANSIT OCCUPANCY -- REVENUES BECAUSE YOU CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER NICE THAT'S AVAILABLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD JUST GO FOR GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COURTING JENSEN WITH TECH THAT OPPOSITION. JOINT COMMITTEE CALIFORNIA'S MANIC CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE -- THOUGH IF THAT'S OF AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL -- WE FEEL THAT AB SEVENTY THIRTY ONE STILL SEVERELY LIMITS I OFFERED WE'RE NOT TAKING FURTHER TESTIMONY AT THIS LEVEL ACCESS I THANK YOU THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THANK YOU. WHERE MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE RICHARD LAZAR EXPEDIA GROUP IN OPPOSITION? GOOD MORNING BUT SHEPHERD REPRESENTING THE CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RESPECT RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CHRISTIAN NUMBERS REPRESENTING BAY AREA COUNCIL RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SING NONE RING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MS GONZALEZ. HAVE A QUESTION I THINK YOU SAID. THE AVERAGE. COST OF A HOUSE IN THE COASTAL ZONE WAS NINETY THREE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY CENTS THE AVERAGE PER PERSON RENTAL IN THE COASTAL ZONE ON OUR PLATFORM IS NINETY FIVE COMPARED TO AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED PER PERSON. RIGHT LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WILL RENT. SO I KNOW A FAMILY CAN GET A HOUSE WITH TWO OR THREE BEDROOMS WERE IS IN A HOTEL IT UP TO GET MULTIPLE ROOMS TYPICAL. MOM [inaudible] DIFFICULT. MAY I GOT A PRETTY BIG FAMILY AND ME TOO WE STAY IN ONE ROOM SELF JUST AND BE REALLY CLEAR. WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE? I I THINK MAYBE WE HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS I I WAS THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT BECAUSE I WAS DOING THE MATH AND THINKING. THAT'S ALL IT IS ALL GO RENT AT THE BEACH -- WHICH WOULD BE VERY AFFORDABLE FOR WAS NINETY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY. AS COMPARED TO SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES IN SAN DIEGO -- I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE MARINE ARYANS OF OBVIOUSLY THIS IS JUST SAN DIEGO NOW. I I WANT TO MOVE THIS BILL I I'M VERY I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD I I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- VERY FAMILIAR WITH MISSION BEACH. LIVED IN PACIFIC BEACH I LIVE IN CROWN POINT -- I I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW BEFORE AIRBNB THOSE WERE RENTALS DONE IN A DIFFERENT FORM AND THEY STILL COULD BE DONE IN A DIFFERENT FORM FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THIS LIMITS. THEIR B. AND B. PORTION OF IT -- NOT YOUR ABILITY TO RENT OUT I WOULD SUGGEST -- I KIND OF MAYBE. IT'S NOT THIS BILL IS NOT GOING IN THIS DIRECTION BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT EXEMPTING -- ASSESSOR YOU DWELLING UNITS ESPECIALLY ONES THAT ARE BUILT UNDER -- PERHAPS UNDER NEW RULES IN DIFFERENT CITIES AND AREAS THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IT'S AT DEALING WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS AND IN FACT IF IT'S JUST BEING BUILT -- TO WITH UNDER THOSE PROVISIONS IN ORDER TO BE AN AIRBNB DOESN'T SOUND VERY A WE'RE NOT MATCHING OUR GOALS UP SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE COULD BE CLEAR FIND LANGUAGE ON NOT -- I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH FOLKS ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT I THINK IT'S PRETTY NARROW AND I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU. OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ADDRESS. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. THIS ONLY REGULATES NUMBER OF DAYS FOR HOSTING PLATFORMS LIKE AIRBNB AND THE RPO. BUT THE HOMEOWNER. AND STILL ROUTE. THE IT THEY KEEP DEBATE RENTED HIS VACATION RENTAL -- PERSON TO PERSON OR ANY OTHER WAY IT'S JUST LIMITS THOSE -- THE HELP POSTING PLATFORMS IS THAT CORRECT THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER ONE EVERY SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS WITH OR WITHOUT THIS BONE STILL HAS TO FOLLOW THEIR LOCAL REGULATIONS. AND YOU KNOW SOME IN MY CITY THAT HAS TO DO WITH NOTICING -- NOISE PERMITS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND THE SECOND THING IS -- THIS IS ONLY REGULATING THE PLATFORM SO IF INDIVIDUAL -- SHORT TERM FATE VACATION RENTAL OUR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER WANTS TO HAVE THEIR OWN WEBSITE AND LISTED OR DO IT WITH FRIENDS THIS ABSOLUTE DOES NOT TOUCH THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS. AND WE CAREFULLY CRAFTED THAT BILL THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT THOSE RIGHTS ARE STILL RETAIN -- THIS IS ONLY THE THANK YOU. MR. TO WHEN ASKED AS ACOSTA COMMISSION WEIGHED IN ON THIS ACCOUNT. SO I BELIEVE THE COASTAL COMMISSION WHEN WE MET WITH THEM SHE'S GOING TO SURGERY TODAY FOR ANY SURGERY. AND THEY HAVE -- GONE THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHERE THEY HAVE REVIEWED THE BILLS THEY HAVE NOT TAKEN POSITIONS ON THE BILLS BUT IN FACT THE COSTA COMMISSIONER FROM SAN FRANCISCO MADE A COMMENT SAYING HE WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THE BILL. AND HE LOOKS FORWARD FOR TO THE OPPORTUNITY OF BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT IT -- I BELIEVE THAT WILL HAPPEN IN MAY AT THEIR NEXT MEETING. I HAVE. TO MENTION AND I'VE HAD A COUPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR FIRST OF ALL VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THE WORK YOU'RE PUTTING TO THIS THIS IS A REALLY DIFFICULT SET OF ISSUES -- AS I HAD MENTIONED TO YOU -- IN SAN FRANCISCO I SPENT SEVERAL YEARS CRAFTING SAN FRANCISCO'S REGULATORY STRUCTURE BEFORE I CAME HERE TO THE ASSEMBLY AND IT WAS REALLY THE FIRST TIME IN OUR STATE. THAT WE HAD GRAPPLED WITH THESE ISSUES AND A FEW THINGS I WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT ARE ONE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE EVERY JURISDICTION HAS VERY VERY LOCAL CONDITIONS THAT. DETERMINE WHAT OUGHT TO HAPPEN HERE -- BUT FOR FOR ME AS A CHAIR THE HOUSING COMMITTEE I THINK THE AFFORDABILITY ARGUMENTS ARE CUTS BOTH WAYS ON THE ONE HAND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO RENT A SPACE FULL TIME AROUND THE YEAR THAT DOES ABSOLUTELY DEPRIVE HOUSING TO A LOCAL COMMUNITY. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND -- AS WAS MENTIONED THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THE RENT AND PAY THE MORTGAGE AND I THINK GIVING SOME FLEXIBILITY. TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS ALLOW THEM TO LIVE IN HIGH COST AREAS AND THAT CERTAINLY WAS THE CASE IN SAN FRANCISCO ON WHICH IS WHY WE CAME UP WITH THE NINETY DAY MARK. AS OPPOSED TO I KNOW THE THIRTY DAY MARK THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED HERE -- I ALSO JUST WANT TO SEND THE ISSUES OF TAXES I'M STILL A LITTLE PUZZLED AS TO WHAT THE TAX COLLECTION ISSUES HAVE BEEN GIVEN HOW MANY CITIES ARE COLLECTING TAXES. WITH REAL ACCOUNTABILITY I'M NOT REALLY I'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHY SAN DIEGO HAS HAD CHALLENGES -- IN THAT REGARD -- AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY BECAUSE IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW OF A IN OUR CITY FULL TIME RENTALS -- ARE CONTINUING TO CREATE AN ISSUE AND AND WE HAVE BAND FULL TIME RENTALS AROUND THE CLOCK IN SAN FRANCISCO AND WHEN WE DID THAT. WE SAW THE NUMBER OF LISTINGS GO DOWN BY HALF. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE -- BUT I JUST WANNA MENTIONED -- THAT I AGREE WITH THAT ASPECT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY -- AS I CHAIR WITH YOU I THINK IF THIS WERE A STATEWIDE BILL I WOULD GIVEN THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT WE HAD WORKED SO HARD AND OUR CITY TO DO. I PROBABLY WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BUT AT THIS MOMENT I'M GOING TO NOT I'M GONNA LAY OFF THE BILL AT TODAY TO SEE HOW THE PROGRESS GOES. IN UPCOMING HEARINGS AND HOPE THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE -- ABILITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NUANCES OF THIS THIS IS A VERY. DIFFICULT AND THORNY AREA OF REGULATORY POLICY I APPLAUD YOU FOR DIVING INTO IT -- AND LOOK FOR TO TO SEE HOW THIS PROCEEDS OVER TIME. SURE AND JUST FOR CLARIFICATION THIS BILL WAS A EACH PLATFORM CAN ONLY LET. WHEN THE PRIMARY RESIDENT IS NOT ON SITE? THE PLATFORM CAN ONLY LIST THAT VACATION RENTAL FOR THIRTY DAYS THERE ARE THREE PLATFORMS THAT EQUALS NINETY DAYS SO THAT IS. FOR THE REASON THAT THERE IS THE SMALL THAT USED TO HAVE A NINETY DAY REGULATION AND HOW DOES SECOND FORCE ACROSS THE THREE PLATFORMS EACH PLATFORM CAN ONLY LIST THAT FOR NINE HAVE FOR THIRTY DAYS THAT WHOSE WHOSE ASCERTAINING THAT HOW YOU. SO EACH PLATFORM CAN ONLY LIST THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS FOR THIRTY DAYS SO THERE'S NO THERE'S NO Q. MOTIVE THERE'S NO WAY WITHIN THE INDUSTRY TO HAVE A CUMULATIVE ASSESSMENT THEY HAVE TO SHARE DATA. BETWEEN THEM AND THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT SO SORRY I'M I MISSPOKE THEY CAN ALL EACH PLATFORM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR THIRTY DAYS THAT THEY CAN LIST. AND ARE THEY REQUIRED TO LET THE CITY KNOW WHEN SECOND I'M JUST CURIOUS AT WE WE WE DOVE INTO THESE ISSUES A SAN FRANCISCO HOW A PLATFORM ASCERTAIN STATES AND AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE MECHANISM THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS SO SO CURRENTLY -- AIR AS THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORM CAN LAST ANY SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY ALLOWS IT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A BANNER NOT IN THE CITY WHETHER OR NOT IT VIOLATES THE CITY'S PERMITTING WHETHER OR NOT THAT PERSON HAS A CITY PERMIT. SO THERE'S NO WAY TO REGULATE THAT -- SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE GONE WITH THIS VERY NEARLY CRAFTED SAYING WHAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PLATFORM THE PLATFORM SAYS IF THE RESIDENTSNOT ON SITE. THEN THE UNIT CAN BE RENTED OUT FOR THIRTY DAYS PERIOD SO IF KEPT VERY NARROW SO WHAT THE PLATFORM CAN AND CAN'T DO. AS FOR YOUR THING ON TO UT I KNOW OUR EXPERIENCE IN IN CITY THIS WAS -- WE REQUESTED THAT WE STRUCK A DEAL WITH AIRBNB TO COLLECT TOT IN RETURN THAT TO THE CITY WE WERE TOLD WE WOULD NOT BE TOLL WE WOULD NOT BE GIVEN INFORMATION ON WHICH UNITS FOR HOW LONG WERE BEING RENTED OUT. WE WOULD JUST GET THE TOT. SO WE WOULD HAVE TO TRUST AIRBNB TO GIVE US THOSE UNITS WE WOULD HAVE NO WAY TO CROSS REFERENCE. DOES IS THAT UNIT RENTING OUT ACTUALLY CONFORM WITH OUR SHORTER VACATION RENTAL PERMITTING PROCESS WHICH WAS VERY LOW IT'S TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO GET A PERMIT YOU TO FOLLOW CERTAIN REGULATIONS -- AND SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THE CHALLENGE OF THE TOT I THINK ONE THING I WOULD SAY WE A FIGURE THIS OUT IN MANY CITIES INCLUDING OURS. I KNOW THAT -- MISTER ROSS DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITYTO TALK ABOUT THE DOT ISSUE BUT IF YOU COULD JUST ADDRESSES FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE SEEMS LIKE. IF THERE'S A MEETING THE MIND ON THIS ISSUE I WOULD ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT YOUR JURISDICTION BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE TAXES ON JUST A LITTLE PUZZLED AS TO VOTERS WAS HEARD ABOUT. THE REALITY THOUGH IS SMALL CITIES CAN'T NEGOTIATE LIKE LARGE CITIES. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THIS BILL DOES IS A EMPOWERS SMALL CITIES TO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE NEGOTIATIONS. IN THE SAME WAY THAT BIG CITIES CAN DO IT WE ARE AT AN ISN'T AS WE HAVE A STAFF OF TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WE HIRED. A PART TIME STAFF FOR NINE MONTHS JUST TO LOOK AT THE PLATFORMS AND WHAT UNITS WERE BEING RENTED OUT. TO CROSS REFERENCE THEM TO SEE DID THEY PULL OUR PERMITS. THIS IS FOR SMALL CITIES WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS. TONIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT I MY GUESS IS THIS THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO PROBABLY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO PULL EVERYONE TOGETHER ON THIS RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS. I I AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW BUT THE POLITICS OF YOUR COUNTY SO I WANT TO I WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW OUR EXPERIENCES. IN OTHER PARTS THE STATE COULD HELP YOU GUYS COLLECT THE TAXES BUT IF I COULD JUST ASK MISTER ROSS BRIEFLY B. AS IN OF THE CHAIRS GETTING IMPATIENT IT'S UNKNOWNS JUST WAITING FOR HIM. I WAS TALKING ALLOW YOU TO STEP IN UNLESS YOU ASK THE QUESTION THANKS AND THAT'S THE QUESTION. SO HI WE'VE GOT AGREEMENTS WITH CITIES LARGE AND SMALL THE CHALLENGES YOU LEARNED IN SAN FRANCISCO IS THAT THE ORDINANCES THE TOT ORDINANCES ARE CREATURES OF LOCAL LAW THEY'RE NOT STATE LAW. I AND FOR THAT AND THE PAY WAR UNDER THOSE AGREEMENTS AS ALWAYS THE POST NOT US SO WE ENTER BALLER VOLUNTARY COLLECTION AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE ENTERED AGREEMENTS WITH CITIES ACROSS THE STATE WHO HAVE FOUND ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEEDED TO AUDIT AND ENSURE THAT THE THAT THE CHARGES -- WERE BEING REMITTED APPROPRIATELY -- AND I JUST NOTE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DO A STATEWIDE BILL WHAT WE DID COME TO IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND OTHERS WITH A SENSE OF WHAT A SORT OF STANDARD AGREEMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEING REPLICATED. IN SMALL JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE SO THERE ISN'T A LOT OF THE THERE AREN'T A LOT OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE LEFT TO BE NEGOTIATED THEY'VE BEEN FIGURED OUT AND LEAST EXPERIENCE IN THE CITIES. THE WE'VE ENGAGE WITH THOSE IT'S BEEN RELATIVELY EASY TO GET TO AN AGREEMENT QUICKLY THAT ALLOWS US TO COLLECT THE TAX I'LL JUST NOTE I MEAN ON THE THIRTY DAY THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE STATE INTEREST INSANE YOU CAN WRITE YOUR UNIT FOR NINETY DAYS BUT WE'RE GONNA DECIDE THAT THE MARKET IS THIRTY THIRTY AND THIRTY SO IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THERE BE IN THE LITTLE BEYOND WHAT YOU THE QUESTION THE OR I THINK THAT'S WHAT DAVID AS AN AT AND WHAT. I WOULD SAY AGAIN APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION I'M MORE THAN HAPPY I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE SITUATION OR TRY TO DEAL WITH AND I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOUR FURTHER AS THE AS THE MACHINES. CAN ABSOLUTELY AND AND ONE ONE COMMENT ON ONE OF THE WITNESSES THAT SPOKE OPPOSITION -- SEC. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO ONLY LOOK AT RESIDENTIALLY ZONED PROPERTIES SO IF THERE IS A RESIDENTIAL TOURISM CATEGORY IN A CITY. THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO LOOK AT THE RESIDENTIAL TOURISM ZONE SO IF MISSION BEACH IS ZONED AS RESIDENTIAL TOURISM LIKE THEIR PLACES IN OCEANSIDE. ZONED AS RESIDENTIAL TOURISM OF THIS BILL WILL NOT APPLY SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE. YOU TO TALK TO YOUR CITY COUNCIL AND IF THE INTENTION IS THAT ZONE IS RESIDENTIAL TOURISM. THEN THAT COULD BE AS OWN A CITY COULD CHOOSE TO DO AND THEN THERE WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHEN OURS. HI I'M THIRTY WITH THAT YOU AND I HAVE ALSO HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO ENSURING THAT THE BILL DOES PRESERVE. LOCAL ORDINANCES AND SOME LOCAL CONTROLS. I'M TO TO QUESTIONS ATTEMPTS FLIPPING THROUGH THIS IS THERE LIKE A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED DEFINITION FOR WHAT IS A SHORT TERM RENTAL. RENTALS LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS OKAY SO THAT'S THAT IS WHAT WE'RE APPLYING TO SO SOMETHING'S BEEN RENTED FOR MORE THAN THIRTY THEIR LONG TERM OR NOT RELEVANT. AND I'M CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO HOW WILL MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL ORDINANCES. ARE NOT PREEMPTED BY THIS. SO LOCAL ORDINANCES -- IN THE COASTAL ZONE HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH THE COAST COMMISSION YEAH THIS IS ONLY APPLYING TO THE COASTAL ZONE WHICH IS WHY YOU KNOW WE WERE GETTING COMMENTS ARE OFFICE SAYING. EVERY CITY NEEDS THIS WHEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE THIS AND WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT THE COASTAL ZONE BECAUSE OF THESE REGULATIONS SO REGULATIONS THAT ARE MORE STRICT THAN THIS. SAY SOME CAT IS CITIES HAVE NEGOTIATED. ONLY THIRTY DAYS TOTAL. THAT S MORE STRICT IN WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE DOING NINETY DAYS BETWEEN THE THREE PLATFORMS. SO WHEN IT'S LIKE THIRTY DAYS TOTAL THAT IS THE GUIDING LAW. AND OFTEN THE LOCAL ORDINANCES WILL HAVE -- PROVISIONS THAT ARE NOT TOUCHED BY THIS BILL THERE WAS A HOW LONG DOES IRAQ IN THE STATE WITH THE MINIMUM STAY LIFE. THEY'LL HAVE WHAT NEIGHBORHOODS THEIR AFFECTED THE HAVE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND THAT THAT IS MORE RESTRICTIVE AND THEREFORE NOT TOUCHED BY THIS BILL. AND THEN I APOLOGIZE YOU MAY HAVE GONE TO THIS IN YOUR TESTIMONY. WHAT WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE CITIES THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY CITIES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS SO WE'VE ONLY RECEIVE ONE LETTER FROM THE CITY OF OCEANSIDE -- FROM SAN DIEGO I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE MAYOR OF OCEANSIDE HIS CONCERN WAS ABOUT THIS RESIDENTIAL TOURISM AND I LET HIM KNOW OUR BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS RESIDENTIAL SO RESIDENTIAL TORE I'M A TOURISM. AS AS OWN WOULD BE OMITTED FROM THIS BILL. IN THE HAVE THE OTHER CITIES EL ENTITY HAS TIME AND TIME EXPRESSED SUPPORT BUT LORENA GONZALEZ ARE MATH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ ALSO REPRESENTS PART OF THE COST OF SOME OF SAN DIEGO [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALRIGHT SING NONE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- WE HAVE TO WE HAVE A STATEWIDE HOUSING CRISIS AND EVERY CITY ESPECIALLY IN THE COASTAL ZONE OF SAN DIEGO NEEDS TO DO THEIR FAIR SHARE OF ADDRESSING THAT. AND IN MY MIND IT'S YOU KNOW WE NEED TO GROW HOUSING BUT WE ALSO NEED TO STOP THE BLEEDING AND WHEN WE HAVE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS THAT PERMANENTLY REMOVE HOUSING FOR MY HOUSING MARKET. THEY THAT IS THE BLEEDING THAT WE HAVE TO STOP THIS BILL APPROPRIATELY REGULATES -- SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS WHEN THE A PROPERTY OWNER IS NOT ON SITE IS THIRTY DAYS PER PLATFORM THAT'S A TOTAL OF NINETY DAYS -- AND IT DOES NOT BAN ANY VACATION RENTAL IN ANY FORM IF SOMEBODY IS ON SITE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO IT YEAR ROUND AFTER PROVIDING LOW COST ACCOMMODATIONS. THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO IT YEAR ROUND SO THIS IS PROVIDING THIS BILL IS NARROWLY TAILORED TAYLOR TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE COAST. TO ENSURE LOW COST ACCOMMODATIONS TO THE SHOW COAST BUT PREVENT HOUSING STOCK FROM BEING REMOVED I AM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO NATURAL RESOURCES CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HI STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHOW. CHOW I TO GONZALEZ.

WE ARE SPONSORING THIS BILL BECAUSE THE STATUTORY TRANSCRIPT FREE HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED IN THIRTY YEARS. AND ONLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN UPDATE THE SPEED. WE HAVE WAITED THIRTY YEARS FOR REYES AND THIRTY YEARS IS TOO LONG. WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO HEAR US AND JOIN US IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN. THE TRIAL IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE RECORD OF THE TRIAL.

THE MODEL REQUIRES US TO SPEND EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS COMPLETING THE WORK. AND THIS BE STATUTE HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN THIRTY YEARS. IN ADDITION COURT REPORTERS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH STATUE IMPOSED DEADLINES. IF A COURT REPORTER DOES NOT MEET THE STATUTE IMPOSED DEADLINE THEY MUST FORFEIT ONE HALF OF THE FEE FOR THEIR WORK. AS A RESULT OF THE STATUTORILY IMPOSED FEE STRUCTURE WE ARE SELF EMPLOYED. WHEN WE WORK NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS THIS MEANS WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY SELF EMPLOYMENT TAXES PAY FOR OUR OWN EQUIPMENT? COMPENSATE ADDITIONAL HELP IS NEEDED AND AT THESE ADDITIONAL HOURS ARE NOT FACTORED INTO RETIREMENT APPLICATION TIME. AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHAT INCREMENTALLY INCREASED THIS TRANSCRIPT BE BEGINNING JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN THE TRANSCRIPT FEE HAS NOT INCREASED IN THIRTY YEARS.

[inaudible] ELEVEN THIRTEEN THE REASON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES. AB ELEVEN THIRTEEN WHAT ESTABLISH AN IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE AFFAIRS AGENCY WITHIN CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT. THEIR NUMBER OF REASONS WHY THIS IS CRITICAL. FIRST OUR STATE HAS THE LARGEST IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY WITH OVER TEN MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. A FEW YEARS AGO GOVERNOR BROWN ESTABLISHED ONE POSITION AS A STATEWIDE DIRECTOR FOR IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION. AND IT IS OUR COALITION'S PERSPECTIVE THAT WE NEED MORE THAN ONE POSITION TO ADEQUATELY SERVE OVER TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF THREE OTHER STATES MASSACHUSETTS NEW YORK IN MICHIGAN WAS SIMILAR AGENCIES. SECONDLY OUR STATE CURRENTLY PROVIDES THROUGH STATE GOVERNMENT A NUMBER OF SERVICES TO OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS BURIED THROUGHOUT OUR STATE BUREAUCRACIES WE NEED ONE AGENCY THAT CAN HELP OVERSEE ALL THE SERVICES. STREAMLINED DELIVERY -- AND ACT AS A CLEARINGHOUSE TO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. THIRD AT THIS TIME IN HISTORY THE CREATION OF A NEW AGENCY WOULD SEND A STRONG SIGNAL TO OUR IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITIES. THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY WELCOME BUT STATE GOVERNMENT IS READY TO HELP THEM SUCCEED AT A TIME WHEN THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IS TARGETING IMMIGRANTS WITH XENOPHOBIC POLICIES. TEARING FAMILIES APART AT THE BORDER KEEPING CHILDREN IN HUMANELY IN CAGES AND SENDING THE SIGNAL THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT VALUED WE NEED TO STAND FOR VALUES. THIS AGENCY WOULD COORDINATE SERVICES ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS ACT AS A CLEARINGHOUSE DEVELOP GRANT PROGRAMS ANDOTHERWISE EVALUATE PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS AND AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER. TO OUR WITNESS FROM THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS CHIRLA. PLEASE THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING THIS TIME. MY NAME IS JOSEPH JENNA DIRECTOR POLICY AND ADVOCACY WHICH CHIRLA. I'M HERE AS A PROP. PROP COULD SPONSOR OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. TWENTY F. TWENTY YEARS AFTER PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY SEVEN WAS ENACTED WE AS THE STATE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. CALIFORNIA WHERE FROM LEADING AN ANTI IMMIGRANT FROM AT AND IMMIGRANTS STATE IN SENTIMENT TO BE A PRO IMMIGRANT STATE THAT INTEGRATES IMMIGRANTS ARE RECOGNIZED THEIR HUMANITY. IN TWENTY EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION RELEASED A STUDY WE THE PEOPLE HELPING NEW COMERS BECOME CALIFORNIA. WHICH WAS A VISIONARY -- IS STUDY THAT I RECOGNIZE THE HUMANITY THE BODY OF IMMIGRANTS BUT MOST IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THAT. THE ROLE OF THE STATE QUOTE THE STATE CANNOT QUIETLY A STEP OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF FEDERAL POLICY THAT FELL OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR BUSINESSES. MESSAGE THROUGH IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THIS CONTINUE TO BE TRUE AND AND NOW IN THIS ERA IN WHICH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THAT CAN MAKE A FAMILIES. DO THAT AND THAT'S WHY THIS PARTICULAR BILL BECOMES IMPORTANT ARE STE OUR STATE MUST BE AT START TO PREPARE A LONG TERM PLAN TO ENSURE THAT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE INTEGRATED. INTO OUR STATE AND READY TO TO FILL THE JOB -- FOR THAT I READY FOR THEM. OUR STATE MUST BE MORE EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION. CALIFORNIA'S COME TO TEN MILLION IMMIGRANTS AND 50% OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HAVE A ONE PARENT WAS SENT AND IMMIGRANT -- 80% OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE US CITIZENS -- AND ALSO TO HAVE A PARENT WHO MIGHT BE UNDOCUMENTED IT IS TIME TO IS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE A RESPONSE FROM OUR STATE. DID THIS POPULATION ADD THIS BILL WOULD EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION. AGAIN BY CREATING THIS AGENCY INSTITUTIONALIZING IMMIGRANT AGGRESSION AND PROTECTION BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY ALSO MAKING SURE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS EFFICIENT AND COORDINATING SERVICES AND THEIR NEEDS. AND FOR THAT WE THINK THIS DONE NUMBER FOR INTRODUCED IN THIS BILL AND WE ARE CHEN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COULD COME FORWARD AND GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION. JESSICA CENTER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

SIX TWENTY EIGHT TODAY AB SIX TWENTY EIGHT WOULD GIVE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE ABILITY TO ACCESS JOB PROTECTED LEAVE.

IF AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER HAS EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL HARASSMENT STALKING. OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT THEY CAN HELP THEIR LOVED ONES ACCESS CRITICAL RELIEF SERVICES THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. FOR SURVIVORS WERE MINORS IN MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION. OR WHO NEED SUPPORT GOING TO A COURT HEARING FOR EXAMPLE. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE ADDITIONAL PAID TIME OFF. IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT SURVIVORS AND IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS CAN CLAIM PAID TIME OFF ALREADY OFFERED TO THEM. BY THEIR EMPLOYER OR TAKE UNPAID JOB PROTECTED TIME TO SEEK RELIEF SERVICES. THERE ARE ALSO EMPLOYER SAFEGUARDS AND VERIFICATIONS IN THE BILL IN WHICH A SURVIVOR AND THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER MUST PROVIDE PROOF. FOR THEIR ABSENCE IF REQUESTED LIKE A POLICE REPORT A DOCTOR'S NOTE COUNSELORS NOTE OR COURT DOCUMENTS SO. RECENTLY TALK ABOUT VERY SEVERE LEVELS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IF IT REQUIRES THE SURVIVOR -- TWO SEEK SUPPORT FROM AN ASSISTANT FOR THE POLICE OR DOCTOR OR COUNSELOR OR TO GO TO COURT. WE'RE ALSO COMMITTED TO CLARIFYING -- WHAT? OR BASED ON OPPOSITION POSITION HAS BEEN AN AMBIGUITY AND IN THE BILL AROUND THE TWELVE WEEK LIMITATION ON THE JOB PROTECTIONS WE THINK THAT. IT'S REFERENCED ACCORDINGLY IN THE BILL BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO MAKE IT CLEAR -- BUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE WE GO TO THE FLORA BEFORE THE NEXT COMMITTEE.

AND WHAT WE SO OFTEN HEAR FROM SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT IS THAT THE PROCESS OF GOING TO COURT -- AND ROLLING CHILDREN A NEW SCHOOLS DEALING WITH RELOCATION AND ALL OF THOSE STOPS THAT -- ARE A KEY PART OF THEIR ROAD TO USE SAFETY HEALING AND STABILITY -- CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING AND EMOTIONAL TIMES AND THAT WHAT THEY OFTEN NEED IS A SUPPORTER OF FAMILY MEMBERS TO BE THERE WITH THEM -- SO BY EXTENT INCLUDING IN THIS BILL -- JOB PROTECTED TIME OFF FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OF SURVIVORS TO BE ABLE -- TO ATTEND A COURT HEARING AS AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT FOR SURVIVOR BE THERE WITH THEM DURING SOME OF THE HARDEST TIMES OF THEIR LIVES WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS THAT SURVIVORS NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THOSE VERY HARD STOPS -- HAVING THAT SUPPORT ALLOWS SURVIVORS -- TO HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES TO BE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN PROCESS IS WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S A TRUSTED AND SAFE PERSON THERE WITH THEM IN ADDITION TO THEIR ADVOCATES ATTORNEYS AND OTHERS. AND SO WE'RE REALLY GLAD TO SEE THIS BILL COME FORWARD REALLY APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR RECOGNIZING THIS NEED AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORTS. HE GIVES GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. VERY GOOD YES YOU ARE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLAN MILLERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. JESSICA CENTER ABOUT LEGAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. JACKIE STERN ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AND SUPPORT. KATHLEEN RESTS ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR DISEASE DASCHLE EXCELLENCE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I'D SAY NINE IS THEIR OPPOSITION HI GOOD MORNING LORD CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANKYOU SO MUCH. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. SIX TWENTY EIGHT WE APPRECIATE THE TIME OF THE OTHERS OFFICE HAS GIVEN US -- ON THIS BILL HOWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY WE FULLY SUPPORT EFFORTS -- TO AND HELP ELIMINATE HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE BUT WITH THIS BILL OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT NOW YOU'RE PLACING THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE LABOR CODE. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING OVERSEAS SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT OCCURS IN THE WORKPLACE THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT OCCURS DURING OR WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED. AND THERE'S MINISTRY TO REMEDY THAT OCCURS AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT NOW THEY'RE PLACING THIS IN THE LABOR CODE AND WITH THAT AND THE DEFINITION THAT WAS TAKEN IS ONLY SIMPLY THE EXAMPLES OF WHAT COULD RISE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. SUCH EXAMPLES AS LEERING SHOWING CARTOONS THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT ALL OF THIS INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR ACTUALLY RISES TO UNLAWFUL SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IT HAS TO MEET THE SEVERE PERVASIVE STANDARD OR THE QUID PRO QUO STANDARD THESE ARE SIMPLY EXAMPLES ADDITIONALLY THE WAY THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED -- WHICH I KNOW IS STAKING AND CURRENT LAW IS THAT IT'S FOR ANY RELIEF IT'S NOT JUST LIMITED TO RELIEVE THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS IT SAYS ANY RELIEF INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED. TO SO I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND LIKE AN EXTREME EXAMPLE HOWEVER IF I WERE TO WALK TO WORK AND GET CáC CALLED AT WORK AS LONG AS I GIVE MY EMPLOYER ADVANCE NOTICE THAT I'M TAKING TIME OFF WORK. THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO KNOW SORT OF VERIFICATION NEEDS TO OCCUR AS LONG AS IT'S PRIOR NOTICE. AND IT COULD BE FOR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THIS CAT CALL OR BEAT LEERING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SO I COULD INFORM MY EMPLOYER THAT I'M TAKING TIME OFF WORK I COULD ALSO LET MY BROTHER KNOWN SEEN DIEGO THAT HE COULD TAKE TIME OFF WORK HE COULD TAKE TIME OFF WORK FOR THE SAME REASONS TO PROVIDE ME. SUPPORT IN SEEKING ANY TYPE OF RELIEF UNDER THIS BILL AND THAT'S OUR OVERALL CONCERN IS THAT AND WITH THE NUANCES THAT ARE OF THE THAT REGARD SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT AND THE DMV H. OVERSEAS THAT NOW WE'RE GONNA BE -- TO GIVE HAVING ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY THROUGH THE LABOR COME SKINNER THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ON THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY RISE TO UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE -- OPPOSED BECAUSE THAT ALSO EXTENDS TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS CHAIR -- CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION AND SOME OTHERS I WANTED TO KNOW A COUPLE ADDITIONAL POINTS -- TO MISS CURTIS'S COMMENTS -- THE FIRST IS ON THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- WE DID SUGGESTS IN THE LAST COMMITTEE SOMETHING NARAL WERE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS OF THE AUTHOR AND A STAFFERS HAD WITH US. ANOTHER PROVISION IS IS THAT THE BILL SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES CONFIDENTIALITY ABOUT THE EMPLOYEE WHO'S TAKING THE LEAVE. AND YET OF COURSE WITH A COMPLAINT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT REQUIRES THE EMPLOYER. TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INTERVIEW WITNESSES AND IT CETERA SO HOW DO WE RECONCILE. THE TENSION THERE BETWEEN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL TAKING THE LEAVE VERSUS OUR DUTY TO INVESTIGATE. ON THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE VICTIM MIGHT NOTED IN THE OPENING COMMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR SAID THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO VICTIMS -- WE HAD SUGGESTED AS WITH LAST YEAR'S VERSION THAT PERHAPS THE VICTIMS BE LIMITED -- OR THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF VICTIMS BE LIMITED TO THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THE VICTIM IS. A MINOR I NOTE THAT YOUR EXCELLENT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS USUAL NOTES ON PAGE SIX ABOUT THE A BURDEN TO THE EMPLOYER. ON THE CERTIFICATION THAT'S REFERENCE AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIVE WITHOUT ANALYSIS. THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS THAT THE THE FAMILY MEMBERS BUT YOU SHOULD NOTE IN THE LANGUAGE THERE'S A DISTINCTION MADE BETWEEN THE UNSCHEDULED ABSENCE AND THE ADVANCE NOTICE WITH THE UNSCHEDULED APPS. THAN A REASONABLE TIME AFTER THAT CERTIFICATION IS PROVIDED BUT WHEN -- WITH ADVANCE NOTICE THE NO CERTIFICATION IS REQUIRED AT LEAST FOR THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT WE BELIEVE THAT CERTIFICATION SHOULD BE IN EITHER INSTANCE WHETHER WAS ON SCHEDULED OR AN ADVANCE NOTICE. THE AUTHOR ALSO MENTIONED IN TWO THIRTY POINT ONE WHICH IS IN SECTION TWO OF THE BILL. IT DEALS WITH THE TWELVE WEEK LIMITATION UNDER -- FMLA THERE'S NO REFERENCE IN SECTION ONE OF THE BILL IN SECTION TWO THIRTY AMENDMENTS TO THE LABOR CODE. THE OTHER POINT IS IS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSES ALTHOUGH THAT THE DATA IS A LITTLE BIT OLD FROM DHEA FREE AGENT IS THE MOST RECENT AVAILABLE. OUT OF ABOUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS THEY DISMISSED OVER FOUR THOUSAND OF THEM DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE SO THERE IS SOME CONCERN THERE. AND THEN LASTLY WE ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE THE COMMENT THAT BY ADDING THESE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS IN THE LABOR CODE TWO THINGS ONE IS. THERE'S A SUBSTANTIALLY LONGER STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THREE YEARS UNDER THE LABOR CODE VERSUS SIX MONTHS IN AND THREE ON THE GOVERNMENT CODE. AND LASTLY ALL OF THIS IS ENFORCEABLE -- BY REPRESENTATIVE ACTION UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. HI SEAN LUIS NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO POST THANK YOU. HEY BORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS A THIRTIES RESPECTFULLY POST. KATIE HANSON FOR THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. GOOD MORNING MATTHEW OUT WITH WESTERN GROWERS ALSO OPPOSED. BRENDEL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU THIS PETRIE-NORRIS. pSHEET WHAT YOU ARE ARE TRYING TO DO TO PROTECT VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. I'M I DO AS I MENTIONED TO YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EXTENSION TO FAMILY MEMBERS SO. AS NOTED AND IN THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SO EVEN EXISTING LINE THE PROTECT VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT STALKING. DOES NOT EXTEND TO IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS CAN OF WHAT. WHAT WAS THE GENESIS SERVE DAY THE REASONING BEHIND INCLUDING THIS IN A? VERY NEW PROVISION AND APPROACH. GENERALLY SPEAKING THE GENESIS WAS TO PROVIDE A NETWORK OF SUPPORT FOR SOMEONE WHO IS GOING THROUGH SOME INFORMATICA NEEDS THE SUPPORT OF A LOVE -- ONE A FAMILY MEMBER TO DO SOMETHING ACTUALLY DIFFICULT GO TO COURT -- GO TO COUNSELING -- GO TO THE DOCTOR AND PERSONALLY SPEAKING I THOUGHT ABOUT MY DAUGHTER. IF SHE EVER -- WAS THE VICTIM -- AND SURVIVED ANY OF THESE -- YOU'RE ABOUT TO VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT STALKING OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS A DAD KEY TAKE ME THE HOSPITAL. I I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT PROTECTED FROM -- LOSING MY JOB AND I THINK OTHER MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND SISTERS AND BROTHERS -- AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF FAMILIES THAT WE'VE DEFINED IN THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO THE SAME AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR SOCIETY WHEN YOU CAN GET LOVE AND SUPPORT. WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING DIFFICULT? SO THAT WAS THE GENESIS AND AND THAT'S WHY WE ADDED THAT TO THE BILL. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT SING NONE THIS ABOUT THE MACROS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- WE AS INDICATED ARE HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT SPRING FOR THE BILL HELP CLARIFY IT WE WANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE A TWELVE WEEK LIMITATION. HERE I WANT NO ONE TO BE UNSURE ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF LEAVE THAT COULD BE TAKEN SO WE'RE GONNA BE WERE INTERESTED IF OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND CLARIFY THAT. IN IN THE MATTER THE NEXT COMMITTEE WE THINK THAT A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION. ARE -- ARE ADDRESSED BY EXISTING LAW OR OTHER PARTS OF THE BILL FOR EXAMPLE THIS ISSUE OF OF CONFIDENTIALITY NOT BEEN ABLE. TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION. OUR BILL SAYS IT BY ITS OWN TERMS THAT THE CONFIDENTIALITY WILL BE. HONORED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW SO IF YOU STILL NEED TO DO INVESTIGATION YOU'RE REQUIRED TO DO THAT BY LAW. THE YOU ALLOWED TO DO THAT BY LAW AND SO WE THINK THAT THE THE BILL ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE. AND YOU KNOW AND AND I AND I I STARTED CONCERNED A LITTLE BIT WHEN I HEAR. THE SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S EMPLOYEES ALL OVER CALIFORNIA THAT ARE SORT OF CONSTANTLY SCHEMING TO GAME THE SYSTEM IN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WE DON'T WE MUCH OF THIS BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE -- FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AND AND AND AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THERE'S NO PROOF THAT THERE'S THIS GAMING OF THE SYSTEM THAT FOLKS ARE TRYING TO ABUSE IT -- BUT THERE IS PROOF OF IS THAT THESE ARE SURVIVORS WHO NEED SUPPORT AND HELP -- I THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE COMMONSENSE BILL THAT PROVIDES THAT AS FOLKS HEAL AND RECOVER -- AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE GALLAGHER. CHOW. CHOW I CHU. CHU AYE GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN.

MR GABRIEL ITEM NUMBER TWO AB THREE THIRTY THE MORNING MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AB THREE THIRTY WHICH WILL EXPAND FUNDING FOR THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL SARGENT SHRIVER CIVIL COUNCIL ACT. PILOT PROGRAMS. THESE PILOT PROGRAMS PROVIDE LIGHT VITAL LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN LIFE CHANGING CIVIL LEGAL MATTERS. IN MANY CASES HAVING AN ATTORNEY CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING A HOME OR BEING EVICTED GAINING OR LOSING CUSTODY OF A CHILD OR SECURING A GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATORSHIP FOR A LOVED. ONE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL RELEASED AN EVALUATION WHICH FOUND THAT THESE PROGRAMS NOT ONLY DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR LITIGANTS. BUT THAT THEY ALSO INCREASE SETTLEMENT REDUCE COSTS ON THE COURT SYSTEM AND PROVIDED NUMEROUS OTHER EFFICIENCIES. UNFORTUNATELY LACK OF FUNDING HAS LIMITED THE REACH OF SHRIVER ACT PROGRAMS AS CIVIL FILINGS HAVE DECREASED SO HAS THE FUNDING FOR PILOT PROGRAMS. INDEED INSTEAD OF EXPANDING THEIR SERVICES SHRIVER ACT PROGRAMS OF HAD TO SCALE BACK THE NUMBER OF CASES THEY CAN ACCEPT AND FOREGO CREATING NEW PROGRAMS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. AB THREE THIRTY RESPONSE OF THIS CRISIS BY MODESTLY INCREASING CERTAIN FILING FEES THAT FUND THE PILOT PROGRAMS BY ALLOWING PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY TO HELP FUND THEM. THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL HELP TO SERVE MORE LANE LOW INCOME LET AGAINST ALLOW PROGRAMS TO EXPAND TO OTHER UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS INCLUDING VETERANS. EXPANSE OF ASSIST OTHER CRITICAL AREAS SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ESTABLISH NEW PILOT PROGRAMS IN PARTS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE YET TO RECEIVE SERVICES. THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD IN ENSURING THAT JUSTICE THROUGH OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE TO ALL NOT JUST THOSE OF MEANS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OUR GERRY SMITH WITH LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SELENA COPELAND OF THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS ON PAGE SIX AND SEVEN OF THE YES SIR THANK YOU YES THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GERMAN STONE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL MY NAME'S GERRY SMITH -- I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES FREE CIVIL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO POOR AND DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN TWENTY THREE COUNTIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN WE'VE BEEN OPERATING ONE OF THE TEN SHRIVER CIVIL COUNCIL. PROJECTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE YOLO COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT -- OUT OF OUR OFFICE IN WOODLAND I'M HERE TODAY NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF MY ORGANIZATION BUT ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE OTHER RECIPIENTS OF SHRIVER FUNDING. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS VERY COMPREHENSIVELY DESCRIBES THE HISTORY OF THE SHRIVER PROGRAM. I AM PRIVILEGED TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF A SMALL GROUP OF ADVOCATES THAT BEGAN THE QUEST FOR THIS PROJECT WE BACK IN. TWENTY SEVEN I THINK IT BEARS EMPHASIZING THAT THIS HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE A BI PARTISAN PROJECT. GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER PUT FUNDING IN THIS IN THIS -- OF BUDGET FOR TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN EVEN BEFORE THERE WAS IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION FOR IT. AND TWO YEARS LATER UNDER MIKE FUEHRER'S LEADERSHIP AND LEADER AND THE GREAT WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS STAFF -- THE PROJECT MOVED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AS A. B. FIVE NINETY AND GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED IT. AND THE PROJECT IS NAMED AFTER HIS FATHER IN LAW ROBERT SARGENT SHRIVER AN ICONIC SOCIAL JUSTICE FIGURE WHO HEADED THE VERY FIRST FEDERAL. LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM WAY BACK IN. NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THIS PROJECT HAS RECEIVED NATIONAL ATTENTION AND RECOGNITION FOR ITS POLICY VISION -- TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE REGIME -- MY PROJECT LEGAL SERVICES NO THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERS WITH DEAL COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT AND THE YOLO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH -- WE HAVE ASSISTED SEVERAL THOUSAND LOW INCOME TENANTS -- SINCE THE PROJECT BEGAN WE CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY TO PROVIDE HOUSING INSPECTIONS WHICH ARE USED BY THE CORE AS AN OBJECTIVE EVALUATION OF PROPERTY IN EVICTION CASES THAT INVOLVE ALLEGATIONS OF SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS -- OUR CLIENTS INCLUDE PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OLDER ADULTS SOME OF WHOM HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME HOME FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AND PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES. THE OVER ARCHING GOALS OF THE PROJECT -- TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE COURT SYSTEM. ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT TRY AND REACH SETTLEMENTS THROUGH -- MEDIATION AND OTHER -- DISPUTE RESOLUTION SERVICES AND TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IN A VERY VERY LIMITED HOUSING MARKET. YOLO COUNTY PRESIDING JUDGE AND THE COURT EXECUTIVE -- HAVE PROVIDED THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT QUOTE. THE PROJECT IMPROVES ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR EVICTION LITIGANTS BY REDUCING THE DISPARITY THAT EXISTS IN REPRESENTATION. PROVIDING LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT -- LITIGANTS ENCOURAGES SETTLEMENT THROUGH MEDIATION AND OFFERS NEUTRAL EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY IN CASES INVOLVING SUBSTANDARD HOUSING SO I DO NEED TO WRAP UP PLEASE. I I JUST WANNA SAY THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN SCRUPULOUSLY AT IT MINISTERED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL RIGOROUSLY EVALUATED -- WITH EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED POSITIVE RESULTS AND WE WOULD URGE SUPPORT OF THIS ENHANCEMENT TO ITS FUNDING BASE. THANK YOU THAT'S WHEN THIS PLACE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STERN AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF -- I'M STILL IN A COUPLE IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND WE WORK WITH ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED LEGAL RIGHTS OF ILLEGALLY PROGRAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE DOESN'T RECEIVE SERGEANT TRAVERSABLE COUNCIL ACT FUNDING. AMERICANIZATION WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS OF THIS COUNTIES EFFORTS TO PASS ORIGINAL AB FIVE NINETY WE CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN BEGINNING IN TIPS ARE BEGINNING IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE CAN BE IN THE LEADERS OF THE ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVING THIS FUNDING.

PROVIDING EXCELLENT SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I NOW SERVE ON THE SHRIVER'S SELECTION COMMITTEE AND ON OUR LAST OPEN PROCESS FOR PROPOSALS WE HAD OVER TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN APPLICATIONS FOR THIS FUNDING ALMOST DOUBLE THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE FUNDS. AND THE BEAUTY OF SHRIVER WHICH ADMITTEDLY REQUIRES EXTRA WORK FOR THE ORGANIZATIONS IS IN THE EVALUATIONS -- I DOUBT THAT ANY -- OUTSIDE ECONOMIC ADULT ANYONE OTHER THAN ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS READ THE FULL SIX HUNDRED PAGE -- EVALUATION BUT THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY GREAT INFORMATION THERE FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE WAYS THAT AND THE INTERVENTION OF A LEGAL AID ATTORNEY CAN MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES -- WE LIVE IN A DATA DRIVEN SOCIETY BUT BECAUSE OF ILLEGALLY DOES NOT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WHERE PEOPLE RETURN TO THEIR DOCTOR OR TO THE HOSPITAL FOR ANNUAL CHECKUPS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SOMEONE RECEIVES OUR SERVICES. BUT WISH DRIVER WE DO THE EVALUATION WENT AND FOLLOWED UP CLIENTS A YEAR AFTER THE FACT TO COMPARE -- WHAT HAPPENED AFTER REPRESENTATION HOW ARE THEIR LIVES IMPROVED OR NOT AND WHAT SHOULD WAS COMMONSENSE IS A PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE ACTUALLY IMPROVED AND HOUSING CASES MORE PEOPLE WERE HOUSED AFTER REPRESENTATION IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND IN CUSTODY CASES? AND PARENTS ABOUT SUPPORTED THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THERE IF YOUR CHILD CUSTODY MODIFICATION ORDERS WHICH MEANS MORE STABLE FAMILIES. SO WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE THINK THE INCREASE FUNDING WILL. BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND TO MORE SUBSTANTIVE AREAS OF LAW THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

BANKS THAT RECEIVED ON AGAIN MEETS TO MAINTAIN THE CONTACT INFORMATION THE BANK FROM WHICH THE SAMPLES WERE RECEIVED. THE ORIGINAL BANK WILL MAINTAIN MORE DETAILED DONOR INFORMATION AS WELL. AND THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE TRANSFER OF GAMETE FROM ONE BANK TO ANOTHER WILL NOT AFFECT THE FAMILY'S ABILITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO PROPER DONOR MEDICAL INFORMATION. IF AND WHEN THEY NEED IT. ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATION UPDATES THE DEFINITION OF DAMAGE TO INCLUDE BOTH -- SITES AND EMBRYOS TO BETTER ALIGN STATE LAWS WITH FEDERAL LAWS. ULTIMATELY THE UPDATES ARE IMPORTANT IN COMPLYING WITH THE FDA'S REGULATIONS.

REYES I THAT BILL IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM. ALRIGHT MS BAUER QUE HAN ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT AB ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT ON AB ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE THE BILL WHICH WILL HELP PROTECT CHILDREN IN CUSTODY MATTERS BY ENSURING. THE DURING COURT ORDERED VISITATION MONITORS TASKED WITH SUPERVISING THESE VISITS HAVE PASSED APPROPRIATE BACKGROUND AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. IN CHILD CUSTODY MATTERS FAMILY COURTS GENERALLY REQUIRE SUPERVISED VISITATIONS WHEN THEIR ALLEGATIONS ARE HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE NEGLECT SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL ILLNESS AND THREATS OF ADOPTION. WHEN SUPERVISED VISITATION IS REQUIRED ISITATION IT MONITOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPERVISING HAS THAT THAT'S? THE MONITORS CAN BE MUTUALLY AGREED UPON FAMILY MEMBERS OR IF REQUIRED THE COURT MAY ORDER THAT THE FAMILIES PAY. FOR VISITATION MINOR. CURRENT STATUTES REQUIRE THE PROFESSIONAL PROVIDERS MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS FOR EXAMPLE THE PROVIDER MUST BE AT LEAST TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD. NOT BE CONVICTED OF A DO YOU AYE WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE NO RECORD OF CONVICTION FOR CHILD MOLESTATION CHILD ABUSE OR OTHER CRIMES. AGAINST A PERSON AND HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF TRAINING. THE TRAINING MUST INCLUDE SUBJECTS REGARDING CHILD ABUSE REPORTING LAWS DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN. AND KNOWLEDGE OF FAMILY LAW BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SUPERVISION THOUGH THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT OF THIS. AND WHILE THE ABOVE MENTIONED STATUTORY TRAINING AND QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS EXIST THERE IS NO WAY FOR PARENTS TO VERIFY WHETHER THE TRAINING'S BEEN MATT OR THE QUALIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MAD. THERE IS NO WHAT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIRED. THE ONLY CURRENTLY REQUIRED VERIFICATION IS FOR THE MONITOR FILL OUT A DECLARATION UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY STATING THEY HAVE UNDERGONE TRAINING AND HAVEN'T BEEN CONVICTED OF CERTAIN CRIMES CHILDLESS MOLESTATION AND CHILD ABUSE AMONGST THEM. THIS IS STRICTLY SELF ATTESTATION AND THERE'S NO STANDARD AS TO WHETHER THE FORM SB SUBMITTED TO THE PARENTS OR OF THE COURTS. IN SOME CASES THE FORM IS AN ACTUALLY SUBMITTED TO ANYONE. IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S NO WAY FOR PARENT WHO'S BEING ORDERED TO HAVE THIS PERSON IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR CHILD TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PERSON IS SAFE TO BE AROUND THEIR CHILD AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CONVICTED OF A SEXUAL FELONY. AB ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE WILL PUT INTO PLACE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS BACKGROUND CHECKS IN IN PERSON TRAINING THE MUST BE COMPLETED AND PASSED BY THE PROFESSIONAL VISITATION MONITORS. TO BETTER ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CHILDREN UNDER THEIR CARE. AS A MOTHER WHO VOLUNTEERS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL I MUST DO MORE OF A BACKGROUND CHECK THAN THESE VISITATION MONITORS. AND THAT IS NOT THE WAY THE LAW SHOULD BE. SO TODAY I HAVE PEOPLE HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME I HAVE LYNNE STEWART FROM CHANGE FOR JUSTICE AND MICHELLE BROWN WITH THE FAMILY LAW SECTION OF THE STATE BAR. AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP MAKE OUR CHILDREN SAFER WE REALLY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY BEFORE YOU AYE WINCER WITH CHANGE FOR JUSTICE. AND I THINK THE BEST WAY FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THIS BILL IS IS DELIVERED TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE TRENCHES SO MICHELLE WHO IS A FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY AND HE'S BEEN. IN THIS BUSINESS ARE MORE THAN TWO DECADES AND RACHEL GAMMA WHO'S A PROFESSIONAL MONITOR AS A NUMBER OF MONITORS WORKING UNDERNEATH THEM I THINK THEY HAVE THE MOST -- VALID TESTIMONIES ALL DIFFER MY TIME TO THEM.

AB ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE IS VERY GOOD AND IT IS INSTRUMENTAL AND IMPORTANT PROTECTION OF CHILDREN. RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO OVERSIGHT FOR SUPERVISED VISITATION MONITORS YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A JUDICIAL OFFICER HAS FELT. THAT THIS PARENT IS SUCH A DANGER TO THIS CHILD THAT THE PARENT CANNOT HAVE CONTACT WITHOUT A SUPERVISOR. AND IF IT'S A PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISOR THE JUDICIAL OFFICER HAS FELT THAT THAT SAFETY IS SUCH A CONCERN THAT WE CAN'T EVEN HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER. YET THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT SO IN STEPS A SUPERVISED VISITATION MONITOR. THE ONLY BUFFER BETWEEN THIS CHILD AND POTENTIALLY A PARENT WHO HAS PHYSICALLY OR SEXUALLY MOLESTED THAT CHILD. AND THERE'S NO. OVERSIGHT THERE'S NO BACKGROUND CHECK THERE'S NO FINGERPRINTING. HOW DO YOU GIVE THIS PARENT COMFORT TO KNOW THAT THAT SHALL BE PROTECTED? GIVE THEM FINGERPRINTING. GIVE THEM THE BACKGROUND CHECK. MAKE SURE THAT THIS PERSON IS TRAINS THERE'S NO BALLING NO INTIMIDATION LET ME PROVIDE THAT CUSTODIAL PARENT THE COMFORT OF KNOWING YOUR CHILD IS GOING TO BE SAFE. THAT THAT MONITOR KNOWS HOW TO STOP THE VISITATION IF THERE IS AN UNDERCURRENT. AND SURPRISINGLY KNOWING THAT THEY CANNOT ACCEPT GIFTS OR BRIBES.

FIFTEEN TED MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. AB FIFTEEN TEN ALLOWS VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THEIR DAY IN COURT BY EXEMPTING FROM THE CURRENT STATUTE LIMITATIONS. CLAIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN BARRED PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ALTHOUGH LEGISLATION WAS PASSED LAST YEAR THAT EXTENDS A STATUE LIMITATIONS FOR DAMAGES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT TO TEN YEARS. THAT LEGISLATION IS NOT RETROACTIVE. LEAVING COUNTLESS VICTIMS WITHOUT RECOURSE INCLUDING CURRENT. AND FORMER U. S. C. STUDENTS VICTIMIZED BY DOCTOR TEN DAHLE. IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE LA TIMES BROKE THE STORY OF A COVER UP BY U. S. C. REGARDING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OF STUDENT PATIENTS. BY TEN DOWN THE SOUL FULL TIME GYNECOLOGIST EMPLOYED BY. THE UNIVERSITY ADDED STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. AFTER THE UNIVERSITIES INVESTIGATION USC QUIETLY PAID. DOCTOR TYNDALL TO GO AWAY AND FAILED TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FINDING OF THE INVESTIGATION. TO STUDENTS. THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. DOCTOR TEN DAHLE STARTED A U. S. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IN OVER THE YEARS IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND FEMALE STUDENTS. WERE IMPACTED BY DOCTOR TYNDALL. FAILURE TO BRING TO LIGHT COMPLAINTS OF DOCTOR TEND ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT ON STUDENTS ALLOWED HIM TO CONTINUE TO ASSAULT ASSAULT. THOUSANDS OF WOMEN FOR YEARS. IT IS VITAL THAT SURVIVORS ARE PROVIDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. AND THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR FOR SURVIVORS TO SEEK JUSTICE. HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL IS A SURVIVOR NICOLE HAYNES. AND HOLLY BOYER FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER ATTORNEYS TO ANSWER ANY LEGAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE -- SERVICE REYES YOU TECHNIQUES THE AMENDMENTS YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS NICOLE HAYNES AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK. IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTEEN TEN DURING MY TIME AT USC I SERVED AS CAPTAIN OF THE TRACK AND FIELD TEAM. AND I SPECIALIZED IN THE HEPTATHLON WHICH IS SEVEN EVENTS COMPUTE OVER TWO DAY PERIOD. I WENT TO THE OLYMPIC TRIALS AND IN THE DECADE AFTER GRADUATING BECAME A PROFESSIONAL TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETE. AND LATER IN LIFE OF BROADCAST JOURNALISM WHO FOR A TIME COVERED USC SPORTS. I AM A TROJAN TO THE CORE. AND THAT IS WHAT MADE MY COMING FORWARD. ABOUT THE ABUSE I SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF DOCTOR TYNDALL. SO INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE DURING MY JUNIOR YEAR AT USC. I WENT TO THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER WITH THE WORST CASE OF FOOD POISONING THAT I'VE EVER. EXPERIENCED. IT WAS THERE THAT I CAME INTO THE CARE OF DOCTOR TYNDALL. AND LIKE SO MANY OTHERS WAS PUT THROUGH THE ORDEAL OF A FULL VAGINAL EXAM FOR SOMETHING TOTALLY UNRELATED TO MY ILLNESS. THIS WAS ALSO MY FIRST GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM. AS I HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN BY AN OB GM WITH BG WHY AND PRIOR TO THAT. DR TYNDALL VIOLATED ME. I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THAT DAY BECAUSE I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT TYPE OF STOMACH PAIN. BEFORE IN MY LIFE. AND I JUST WANT TO THE FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND GET SOME TREATMENT. SO WHEN I WAS ASKED TO DISROBE AND PUT MY FEET UP IN THE STIRRUPS TO GET THE VAGINAL EXAM I COMPLETELY COMPLIED I JUST. WANTED TO BE OUT OF THIS IMMENSE PAIN. AFTER THE EXAM WAS DONE I WAS TOLD YOU HAVE FOOD POISONING GO HOME. AND IT'LL PASS WITHIN SEVERAL HOURS. I WAS LAKE. THAT WAS IT I WENT THROUGH ALL THAT. JUST TO GO HOME. IT NEVER THOUGHT WELL WITHIN MY SPIRITS. IT WASN'T UNTIL I STARTED READING STORIES ABOUT WITH DOCTOR TYNDALL DID LAST YEAR IN THE NEWS. THAT MY CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BACK IN. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE BECAME CRYSTAL CLEAR. I IMMEDIATELY REACH OUT TO A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S A PHYSICIAN. AND ASKED IS IT NORMAL TO GET A FULL VAGINAL EXAM WHEN YOU GET FOOD POISONING. ANY KIND OF CHUCKLED WITH LAKE NO WOULD YOU TALKING ABOUT. LIKE HUNDREDS OF MY FELLOW CHOSEN SISTERS. I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY SOMEONE WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE. MY TRUSTED DOCTOR. A DOCTOR THAT USC KEPT EMPLOYED AND ALLOWED TO TREAT YOUNG WOMEN LIKE ME. LONG AFTER REPORTS OF HIS ABUSE. MY MOM WAS ABUSED AS A CHILD AND SHE CONSTANTLY REMINDED ME HEY IF ANYBODY TOUCHES YOU IN AN INAPPROPRIATE WAY. LET ME KNOW. I NOW HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD AND I'M CONSTANTLY TELLING HER HEY IF ANYBODY TOUCHES YOU LIKE THIS. LET ME KNOW. THESE PREDATORS CAN'T BE STOPPED UNLESS THE REPORTED. AND I KIND OF FEEL ROB TO THAT I WAS AN ABLE TO REPORT THAT DURING MY TIME BECAUSE I TRUSTED USC AND ITS EMPLOYEES TO TAKE THE BEST CARE OF ME. I HAD TO COME FORWARD TODAY NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR MY MOM. AND FOR THE HUNDREDS OF OTHER WOMEN WHO HAVE SAT. WITH THEIR SHAME FEAR AND MISTRUST ABOUT THE ABUSE THEY SUFFER BY SOMEONE WHO'S SUPPOSED. TO CARE FOR THEM. THIS SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING WHEN THIS TYPE OF ABUSE IS ALLOWED TO OCCUR FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WHEN THE GOOD NURSES. WHO REPORTED THIS HORRENDOUS CONDUCT WERE MET WITH INACTION OR BETTER WORSE? A COMPLETE COVER UP. THE SYSTEMIC FAILURE IS CONTINUING NOW IS WE TRY TO BRING OUR CASE TO COURT. THE INSTITUTION THAT ALLOWED THE ABUSE U. S. C.. IS CLAIMING THAT ARE QUE DEADLINES AND STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIMIT OUR RIGHTS AND OUR VOICES. WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. AB FIFTEEN TEN WILL GIVE SURVIVORS LIKE ME WHO HAVE COME FORWARD A CHANCE TO HOLD THOSE WHO HARM DEATH ACCOUNTABLE. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO COME FORWARD. ON A SUBJECT LIKE THIS IN A VERY PUBLIC PLACE. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS DOCTOR GEORGE TEND ALL THE ONLY FULL TIME GYNECOLOGIST A USC STUDENT HEALTH CARE CENTER. USES POSITION OF TRUST AND AUTHORITY TO MOLEST ABUSE AND HIM HUMILIATE STUDENTS MANY OF WHOM WERE TEENAGERS SEEKING A GYNECOLOGIST FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. TINDALL WOULD INSTRUCT STUDENTS TO LIE NAKED ON THE EXAM TABLE WHILE HE SLOWLY INSPECTED EVERY PART OF THEIR BODY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS AND PHOTOGRAPHING THEIR GENITALIA. HE WOULD INSERT HIS UNCLE OF TWO FINGERS INSIDE A PATIENT UNDER THE GUISE OF A MEDICAL EXAM DESPITE BEING COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY AND EXTREMELY IMPROPER. WHILE TYNDALE'S RAMPANT SEXUAL ABUSE IS DEEPLY DISTURBING WHAT IS PERHAPS MORE DISTURBING IS THAT U. S. C. KNEW THAT TEN DAHLE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSING STUDENTS FOR DECADES. AND DID NOTHING TO STOP IT. AFTER THE VIEWS AND COVER UP WAS FINALLY MADE PUBLIC IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A BRAVE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEMALE VICTIMS HAVE COME FORWARD AND INITIATED ACTIONS AGAINST USC IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT. MANY OF THESE VICTIMS HOWEVER NOW FACE YET ANOTHER OBSTACLE. AN EXPIRED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. AB FIFTEEN TEN PROVIDES A NARROW ONE YEAR REVIVAL PROVISION TO THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS TO GIVE THESE VICTIMS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR CASE. HEARD IN COURT. THE ONLY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IS U. S. C.. USC ARGUES THAT THE THE BILL DESTROYS A PROPOSED FEDERAL CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT REACHED WITHIN ONLY A FEW SHORT WEEKS AFTER THE ABUSE WAS CLOSED. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. AB FIFTEEN TEN DOES NOT REVIVED CLEANS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A FINAL SETTLEMENT. THAT HAS BEEN REACHED. USC ARGUES THAT AB FIFTEEN TEN DEPRIVES WOMEN OF THE CHOICE TO RESOLVE THEIR CLAIMS IN A MANNER THAT THEY FEEL APPROPRIATE. BUT THE EXACT OPPOSITE IS TRUE. AB FIFTEEN TEN PROVIDES WOMEN THE CHOICE OF WHETHER TO SEEK REDRESS THROUGH THE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT OR PURSUE AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIM IN STATE COURT. THESE VICTIMS SHOULD NOT BE HANDCUFFED TO A SETTLEMENT THAT THEY MAY BELIEVE IS UNDRESSED. IT IS ONLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB FIFTEEN TEN THAT THESE VICTIMS HAVE A MEANINGFUL CHOICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU HELLO WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AND THE SEVERAL THOUSAND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THEY WERE PRESENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. JESSICA CENTER ABOUT EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. YOUNG CANGO A CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIANS PART. I'LL HANDLE THAT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CHANGE FOR JUSTICE AND SUPPORT. SAID ALI KING WITH THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS MUCH AUDIBLE GOV ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I TOO WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND ALL THE HARD WORK ON THE ANALYSIS. I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND EFFORT THAT HE PUT INTO THAT. AB FIFTEEN TEN IS UNNECESSARY LEGISLATION THAT SEEKS TO INVALIDATE AND ESTABLISH LEGAL PRINCIPLE THAT IS THE BEDROCK OF OUR CIVIL JUSTICE PROCESS. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF AB FIFTEEN TEN IS TO ENSURE THAT NONE OF DR TYNDALE'S FORMER U. S. C. PATIENTS. ARE PREVENTED BY STATUTE OF LIMITATION RESTRICTIONS FROM RECEIVING A DAMAGE AWARD. BUT THAT PROBLEM HAS ALREADY BEEN CONSIDERED AND ADDRESSED. MONTHS BEFORE THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED US HE AGREED TO A FEDERAL CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT THAT OFFERS MEANINGFUL COMPENSATION. FOR ALL WOMEN THAT SAW DOCTOR TYNDALL FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES. UNLESS THEY CHOOSE TO OPT OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT. THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT WAS EXPRESSLY DESIGNED TO INCLUDE. ALL WOMEN WITH TIME BARRED CLAIMS. THE SETTLEMENT WHICH WAS REACHED IN COLLABORATION WITH IT NUMEROUS PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS AND ENDORSED BY A FEDERAL MEDIATOR OFFERS WOMEN CERTAINTY AND PRIVACY. WITH THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF A JURY TRIAL THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A PLAINTIFF THE WILL PREVAIL IN AN INDIVIDUAL LAWSUIT. FOR THE MORE LITIGATION FORCES WOMEN TO RELIVE THEIR ORDEALS PUBLICLY. WHEREAS THE SETTLEMENT RESPECTS THE PRIVACY OF THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO X.. EXPOSE THEIR EXPERIENCES AND PUT THEM ON DISPLAY FOR ALL THE WORLD TO HEAR. IN ADDITION TO THE MONETARY RELIEF FOR PATIENTS THE SADDAM INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN ATTORNEY'S FEES AND A BROAD RANGE OF OPERATIONAL REFORMS THAT IN CONCERT WITH CHANGES IN MEDICATIONS. ALREADY IMPLEMENTED BY U. S. C. WILL PREVENT SUCH CONDUCT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN TO ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE TROJAN COMMUNITY. THIS IS A JUST AND COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT THAT ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR LEGISLATION LIKE AB. FIFTEEN TEN NOT ONLY IS THIS BILL UNNECESSARY BUT IT ALSO THREATENS TO SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. BY INVALIDATING STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WHICH EXIST RESERVE BOTH THE INTEGRITY OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. AND THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. EXTENSIONS OF STATURE LIMITATIONS ONLY SERVE TO REVIVE A CLAIM. NOT THE RECORDS OR MEMORIES OR EVIDENCE REQUIRED TO LITIGATE. SO WHERE THE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT PROVIDES WOMEN A GUARANTEED OUTCOME. DECADES OLD CASES. LITIGATED INDIVIDUALLY MAY YIELD ON CERTAIN RESULTS AND HOLD THE POSSIBILITY OF NO RECOURSE WHATSOEVER. IT WOULD BE TRULY UNFORTUNATE IF ONE OF THE MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF AB FIFTEEN TEN WAS TO EMBOLDEN WOMEN. WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT TO PURSUE AN UNWINNABLE CASE IN STATE COURT AND WIND UP WITH NOTHING? FURTHER ATTORNEYS WHO SOLICIT PLAINTIFFS HAVE AN EHICAL OBLIGATION TO HONESTLY EXPLAIN THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF I'M SORRY OF OPTING OUT OF THE FEDERAL CLASS SETTLEMENT. EVEN WITH THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION EXTENSIONS THERE ARE MANY RISK FOR PLAINTIFFS WHO CHOOSE TO PURSUE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. PERHAPS WORSE THERE IS A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE ATTORNEYS. ACTIVELY SOLICITING PLAINTIFFS USING THIS BILL. AS A MEANS TO PERSUADE. PLAINTIFFS THAT MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULT ODDS IN STATE COURT TO TAKE A SIGNIFICANT GAMBLE ON JUSTICE. AS YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATES EVEN IF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIM HAS NOT LAPSED. AND THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO AN AWARD IN THE SETTLEMENT IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT THE PLAINTIFF WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROVE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION IN COURT. WELL THE SPONSOR MADE IT CLEAR THAT AB FIFTEEN TEN IS DIRECTLY AIMED AT USC THIS BILL HAS FAR REACHING CONSEQUENCES FOR CALIFORNIA'S MANY DISTINGUISHED LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES. AND SMALL INDEPENDENT UNIVERSITIES AS IT WOULD ALSO REVIVED CLAIMS FOR THEM AND NOT JUST FOR U. S. C.. JUSTICE SHOULD RIGHTFULLY BE SERVED FOR VICTIMS BUT THIS KIND OF RETROACTIVE LIABILITY COULD BANKRUPT SMALL AND LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES IN YOUR DISTRICTS IN AROUND CALIFORNIA. GIVEN THE SIZE OF SOME OF THE SCHOOLS IN DOWN MEN'S ONE BAD DOCTOR WHO SAW PATIENTS DECADES AGO COULD SPELL THE END OF THE INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES. THE BILL MAY ALSO HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON PHYSICIANS. WHO WILL FACE MORE OCCUPATIONAL RISK AND SKYROCKETING INSURANCE PREMIUMS? AB FIFTEEN TEN WILL UNDOUBTEDLY INCREASE INSURANCE MALPRACTICE PREMIUMS FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND PARTICULARLY FOR OBGYN. WHICH COULD HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR WOMEN AND THEIR HEALTH CARE. SIMPLY PUT AB FIFTEEN TEN IS BAD POLICY AND WILL CREATE A MULTITUDE OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND LEGAL CHALLENGES. WHILE DOING VERY LITTLE TO PROTECT PATIENTS OF STUDENT HEALTH CARE CENTERS FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR NOBLE ON A. B.. FIFTEEN TEN THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] SEEING NONE. THIS RACE TO MAKE CLOTHES. I THINK WITH THE TESTIMONY PROVIDED BY MS HAINES IT'S CLEAR THAT JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN SERVED IF A CLASS ACTION -- SETTLEMENT. IS BEING PROPOSED. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VICTIMS. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT THE VICTIMS WILL BE ABLE TO SEEK THEIR JUSTICE AND TO CHOOSE EITHER TO GO WITH A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR TO SUE INDIVIDUALLY. AND FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO PUBLIC SAFETY CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHOW. CHOW I CHIU GONZALEZ. CONSULT AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KILEY MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS REYES. HI RES I NEEDS O MORE SO WE'LL PUT THE BILL ON CALL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAU. SIX IS TO ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN AB. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND I WILL SECOND THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SO I LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING. OF THE AMENDMENTS ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS -- WHICH ESSENTIALLY MOVE REMOVE SO SECTION TWO OF THE BILL RELATED TO CRITICAL. INCIDENTS AND ALSO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. ALL THIS BILL AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO WOULD ESTABLISH A BALANCE BETWEEN. PERSONAL PRIVACY AND PUBLIC SAFETY BY CREATING SPECIFIC PROCEDURES AROUND THE RETENTION. AND SHARING OF DATA COLLECTED BY AUTOMATED DONE LICENSE PLATE READERS OR A. L. P. R.'S. THE OPR IS A HIGH SPEED CAMERA SYSTEMS THAT PHOTOGRAPH LICENSE PLATES CONVERT THE NUMBERS AND LETTERS INTO MACHINE READABLE TEXT. TACK THEM WITH THE TIME AND LOCATION AND THEN UPLOAD DOT DATA INTO A DATABASE FOR RETRIEVAL. OUR WITH THE ALLOWED THIS INFORMATION CAN HAVE AND HAS HAD A POSITIVE PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES. WITHOUT PROPER GUIDELINES -- THE TECHNOLOGY POSES ALSO A THREAT TO THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES SAID L. P. R. IN USERS PROVIDE USE USE AND PRIVACY POLICIES. ARE FOR SECURITY OF ANY DATA THAT IS COLLECTED ABOVE IN TERMS OF STORAGE AND ACCESS DESTROY ANY NON INVESTIGATIVE DATA AND ALSO MAKE THE POLICIES ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW IS OF ACHE IN SILENT AWE AND IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH THE ASSURANCE OF KNOWING. ALL WHETHER OR NOT THEIR INFORMATION IS SO INDEED SAFE. THIS BILL EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO WITH SAY KERR THIS INFORMATION BY PLACING LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG A PR DATA IS KEPT. AND ALSO HOW IT IS -- BEING SHARE MAKING SURE THAT END USERS MISS TREAT THIS INFORMATION IN THE SAME WAY AS THE OPERATOR. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THEY HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT? SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING WOULD BE PROUD CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS WE DO NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL. LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR AND STAFF FOR THE AMENDMENTS ARE PROPOSED THE BILL THEY GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING OUR CONCERNS WE DO HAVE SOME CONTINUING CONCERNS AND LOOK FORWARD.

TO REFINE THE DEFINITION OF A ANIMALS ASIAN AND ALSO THE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AND USER AND THE OPERATOR SO -- WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND THE INTENT IS TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH IS THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO PRIVACY CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHAU I CHARGE YOU. GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN KALRA KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS RACE. THE NEED FOR MORE SCHOOL FOR THE BILL ON CALL. I THINK SINCE MR OBERNOLTE START HERE I WOULD TAKE UP MY ITEMS MS GONZALEZ WOULD YOU CHAIR THE COMMITTEE FOR ME [inaudible] YEAH MANY OF YOU HAVE -- USE IT SPARINGLY. THOSE ARE NOT REAL MEETINGS. NOW I I WANT THIS BILL PRESENTATION BE LIKE APPROPRIATIONS. ALL RIGHTS STONE THAT START WITH AB. SEVEN FORTY NINE THAT WORKS FOR ME PLEASE YOU MADAM CHAIR. RIGHT AB SEVEN FORTY NINE IS TO ADDRESS. NO RE HIGHER PROVISIONS AS THEY EXIST [inaudible] THE HEAD. RECENT COVERAGE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAS REALLY SHOWED A LOT OF ATTENTION APPROPRIATELY. ON THE FACT THAT COMPANIES AND EVEN LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND PUBLIC AGENCIES TEND TO LIKE TO PUT IN A NO REHIRE PROVISIONS NEVER HIRE PROVISIONS HAVE THE VERY DIRECT EFFECT THAN. OF PUNISHING. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS COME FORWARD WITH A CLAIM. AND THEN THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT OF THAT CLAIM ENDS UP SIGNING IN A NO REHIRE AGREEMENT AND WHAT'S ASTONISHING TO ME AS I LOOK THROUGH EXAMPLES OF THESE. THIS IS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR VICTIM OF AN ABUSE WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION WHO THEN IS RE VICTIMIZED BY LOSING ACCESS TO A CAREER. A CAREER PATH OR EVEN IN THE ORGANIZATION THAT THEY CAME FROM. AND ADDING INSULT TO INJURY OFTENTIMES PERPETRATOR THAT. STAYS ON THE JOB MAY HAVE SOME HAVE HAD SOME. ACCOUNTABILITY NOT ALWAYS BUT IS USUALLY THERE AND THEN IT'S THE VICTIM WHO IS THEN MOVED ON THIS SEEMS TO BE VERY UNFAIR AND INAPPROPRIATE WAY OF UTILIZING THE LAW. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WHO HAVE. DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH HAVING BEEN THROUGH THESE PROCESSES AND HAVE BEEN. DENIED. ACCESS TO JOBS THROUGH NEW HIRE NO HIGHER PROVISIONS AND SO AT MY WITS IS SPEAKING WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IBM THANK YOU FIRST WITH AS GOOD NAME IS CARMEN FIELDS. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU MY STORY ABOUT HOW I LOST MY CAREER. BECAUSE I WAS FORCED TO RESIGN AND AGREE TO A NO REHIRE CLAUSE AS A CONDITION OF SETTLING A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM. I STARTED WORKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA OUR PATROL IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND AND TEN IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SHORTLY AFTER LETTER JOHNSON WAS HIRED BY CHP. HE BEGAN SOCIALLY HARASSING ME AND OTHER FEMALE CO WORKERS. IT STARTED WITH HIM INSISTING THAT I HIGH FIVE HIM. THEN GRABBING MY HAND WHEN I DECLINED. I ASKED HIM TO STOP BUT HE WOULD NOT. IT QUICKLY PROGRESSED TO HIM RUNNING HIS FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR I'M DOING MY HAIR WHEN I PUT IT IN A BUN. AND FORCING HIS WAY INTO SITTING ON MY LAP. THESE ACTIONS WERE WITNESSED BY SEVERAL OTHER EMPLOYEES INCLUDING SUPERVISORS. I DEMANDED THAT HE LEAVE ME ALONE. I FREQUENTLY COMPLAIN TO MY COMMANDER WHO SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. ABOUT THE HARASSMENT. ON MARCH THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWELVE JOHNSON ATTACKED ME. DRAGGING ME INTO A PRIVATE OFFICE. BY MY WRIST. ATTEMPTING TO KILL SPEAK. AND PUSHING HIS BODY AGAINST MINE YES I'VE FOUGHT HIM OFF. I REPORTED THIS CRIME TO THE CITY TREE MANAGER OF INCLUDING MY DIVISION CHIEF. OUR UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER. I DEMANDED THE CHIEF PROTECT ME FROM JOHNSON AND TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT. THE CHIEFS RESPONSE WAS TO LEAVE LANDING. IN ITS MANAGERIAL POSITION. AND ADMINISTRATIVELY TRANSFER ME TO A LESS DESIRABLE POSITION. TO SEE IF YOUR VIRTUALLY ASSIGNED AN INVESTIGATOR. BUT THE CHP REFUSED TO COMPLETE THEIR INVESTIGATION AND I WAS LEFT WITH NO CHOICE. BUT TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE EEOC. ALTHOUGH JOHNSON ADMITTED LEAD ADMITTED TO SEVERAL ARRESTING SEVERAL FEMALE OF CO WORKERS UNDER HIS COMMAND WHILE HE WAS A PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE. THE CHP GRANTED HIM PERMANENT CIVIL SERVICE STATUS INFORMING HIM THAT HIS BEHAVIOR MET THE STANDARDS. THAT C. H. P. EXPECTED OF ITS MANAGERS. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS JOHNSON CONTINUES TO WORK FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MAKES 40% MORE TODAY THAN HE DID THEN THE DAY WHEN HE ATTACKED ME. THE RETALIATION AGAINST ME HOWEVER CONTINUED. I WAS DENIED PROMOTIONS BECAUSE I FILED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT. MY DAUGHTER WORKS FOR THE CHP. AND HER SUPERVISOR BRAG ABOUT NOT PROMOTING ME BECAUSE I HAD FILED. THE COMPLAINT. THE SIEGE HE PRESSURED ME TO SETTLE THE CASE. AND WERE ADAMANT THAT I BE FORCED TO RESIGN. I DID NOT WANT TO RESIGN. I LOVE THE JOB. AND I LOVE THE FRIENDS THAT I HAVE. TO SPEAK. THE MORE I PUSH BACK AGAINST A AGAINST SUBTLY BY RESIGNING THE MORE SPEECH THE MORE AGGRESSIVE THE SPEECH HE GOT WITH MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS. I WAS INFORMED THAT THE CHP INTENDED TO DISPOSE MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS GOING BACK INTO MY CHILD. ALL I EVER WANTED WAS TO BE PROTECTED FROM JOHNSON I'M SO USED TO TELL ME THAT WAS NOT AN OPTION. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT I WAS FORCED TO AGREE TO A NO REHIRE PROVISION. MEANING I COULD NO LONGER WORK FOR THE STAGE BE OR ANY OF ITS DEPARTMENTS. AREAS OR DIVISION. THANK OR VOLUNTEER [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS DESPITE HAVING OVER TWELVE YEARS OF JOB EXPERIENCE SIX YEARS OF EXEMPLARY PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS FROM STAGE BIG IN OTHER REGIONS. AND I HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY OTHER QUEUE TO BE EMPLOYEES. WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT? AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WILL NOT REPORT BECAUSE THEY FEAR COMING FORWARD TO LOSING THEIR JOBS I DID. IT IS UNFAIR THAT IN A MINUTE SEXUAL ROUNDER CONTINUES TO WORK FOR THE STATE. RECEIVING PROMOTIONS AND RAISES. WELL I AM PREVENTED FROM FOR THIRD PLACE. SIMPLY BECAUSE LIKE US TO BE PROTECTED FROM ROOMS. THIS IS NOT A HE SAID SHE SAID SITUATION. HE FREELY AND WAS ACTIONS AGAINST ME. AND DOESN'T SEEM TO BE EMBARRASSED OR ASHAMED OF WHAT HE DID. REQUIRING VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND NEVER REALLY BE REHIRED WHICH IS THE ULTIMATE FORM OF INSTITUTIONAL RETALIATION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JESSICA CENTER AND I'M AN ATTORNEY EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES OUR PRACTICAL SPONSOR THIS BILL WE REGULAR REGULARLY REPRESENT WOMEN OF EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER FORMS OF WORKPLACE -- HARM AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS FOR WORKERS TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT HARASSMENT ANOTHER WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS IS FEAR RETALIATION BEING FIRED HAVING THEIR WAGES REDUCED AND IS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS FOR HIM THERE IS NO. OFTEN NO SAFETY NET WORKERS OFTEN DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF THESE NO RE HIRE CLAUSES AND ARE REALLY JUST READY TO ACCEPT WHATEVER IS IN THE AGREEMENT TO PUT THE MATTER BEHIND THEM. AND BECAUSE AS WE'LL HEAR ABOUT IT'S BECOME PRETTY BOILERPLATE FOR THESE PROVISIONS TO BE IN THE AGREEMENTS WORKERS OFTEN FEEL THAT THEY HAVE TO JUST SETTLE IT EXCEPT THAT PROVISION IN ORDER TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES. I'LL GIVE YOU REALLY QUICK EXAMPLE LOW WAGE IMMIGRANT WORKER THAT WE REPRESENT AID SHE THE PLAYER HAS BOILERPLATE LANGUAGE IN THE AGREEMENT REQUIRED HER TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT SAYING SHE WOULD NOT BE. REHIRED SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T MIND BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT SPECIFIC EMPLOYER BECAUSE THIS THE HARASSER WAS STILL THERE -- SHE CALLED US ABOUT FOUR MONTHS LATER AND SAID SHE BEEN DIED A JOB AT A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT CHOOSE A DISHWASHER BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS OWNED BY THE SAME COMPANY. AND THAT THIS IS NO REHIRE CLAUSE APPLIED ALL THEIR SIX NOW THERE'S MORE RESTAURANTS IN SAN FRANCISCO I'M SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WORKERS OFTEN DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND. THAT SIGNING THESE AGREEMENTS WILL PRECLUDE THEM FROM MANY DIFFERENT JOBS IN THE FUTURE -- FOR MANY WOMEN THESE CLAUSES CAN BE SO BROAD THAT IT FORCES THEM TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THEIR CAREERS AND FOR THESE REASONS VERMONT RECENTLY BANNED NO REAL HIGHER CLAUSES IN THESE KINDS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. I THINK WE'VE SEEN WITH THE ME TOO MOVEMENT AN EXPLOSION OF PEOPLE COMING OUT TO SPEAK ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OTHER HARMS AND WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF OUR ASPEN AND OTHER ABUSES. SO THEY CAN SPEAK OUT WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION AND WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING BANNED FROM WORKING FOR THAT EMPLOYER OR OTHERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MARIE GO YOSHIHARU WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR BRINGING THIS. BILL FORWARD AND CARMEN FOR TELLING YOUR STORY AND AS YOU'VE HEARD OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO THESE NO REHIRE CLAUSES OF SORT OF SURREPTITIOUSLY BECOME STANDARD IN ALL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITHOUT ANY REAL SCRUTINY FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. AROUND WHY THEY'RE IMPOSED ON WORKERS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THEY HAVE ON THOSE WORKERS AND THEIR JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND AND CAREER PATH. SO WHY DO YOU EMPLOYERS USE THESE ARE REQUIRE THESE NO REHIRE CLAUSES AND ALL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. THEY SAY IT'S TO PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN UNLAWFUL OR AGREE JUST CONDUCT FROM SEEKING RE EMPLOYMENT FROM THE SAME EMPLOYER. BUT THEN WHY ARE THEY REQUIRED IN ALL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS IF THE WORKER ENGAGED IN AGREE JUST ARE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT IN THERE ARE VALID REASONS JUST NOT TO REHIRE THE PERSON. TO THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO GET AROUND A RETALIATION LAWS AND NOT RE HIRE SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE THEY FILED THE COMPLAINT. WE KNOW THAT EMPLOYERS MAY NOT WANT TO RE HIRE SOMEONE. TO SUE THEM IN SAY A SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWSUIT BUT THAT IS RETALIATION. AND WHY ARE WE ALLOWING EMPLOYERS TO INSULATE THEMSELVES FROM ANY SORT OF RETALIATION CLAIM WHEN ONE WORKERS MAY HAVE A VALID RETALIATION CLAIM IF THEY'RE NOT RE HIRED JUST BECAUSE THEY FILE THE COMPLAINT AND SETTLED THEIR CLAIM WHICH IS THE POSITION OF THE EOC AND TO WIN THESE CAUSES ARE SO OVER BRIAN AND UNNECESSARY IF AGAIN THERE ARE VALID REASONS TO NOT RE HIRE THE PERSON. SO WE THINK THESE NO REHIRE CLAUSES. REALLY SERVE NO PURPOSE BUT TO INSULATE EMPLOYERS FROM LIABILITY. AT THE AT THE EXPENSE OF BROADLY PUNISHING VICTIMS WHO ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN EXPECT VICTIMS AND LOOK TO COME FORWARD WHEN THIS IS THE PRICE THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY SO WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. STE CHALLENGES YOUR SECOND HAND YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY I DON'T KNOW YOUR ROLES MR STONE SO IS IT THREE WITNESS SAYS. I TYPICALLY ALLOW THREE BUT WITH OKAY. AND THEN I'M SORRY. TRACK. GET THIS WHAT TO TALK AND GOING ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR STORY. I'M SUGGESTS YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AND SUPPORT FOR THE BILL GOOD MORNING ABBE AT C. PEPPERING ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER TRAINS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. GEN GARY AND WE HAVE A LEGALLY THAT WORK IN SUPPORT. SIR ANY OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED I'M I THINK THE ISSUE WITH REGARDS TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT VICTIM AND RETALIATION IS A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD ISSUE IN THE EEOC GUIDANCE. OR THE SUGGEST -- THAT THAT'S UNLAWFUL IN COULD BE A THE SITUATION OF RETALIATION IF YOU HAVE A VICTIM WHO HAS FILED A COMPLAINT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THEN YOU HAVE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN WHICH THERE IS A NO REHIRE. OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL IS NOT FOCUSED ON THAT OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL IS THAT IT'S MUCH BROADER AND ACTUALLY COULD PROTECT THE HARASSER THAT WE JUST HEARD DESCRIBED IF THEY FILE A COMPLAINT. AGAINST THE EMPLOYER FOR DEFAMATION WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT UNCOMMON AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE EXAMPLES OF PUBLISHED CASES IN WHICH HARASSER THEMSELVES. AFTER BEING INVESTIGATED AND ALLEGED TO HAVE ENGAGED IN HARASSMENT HAS AND FATHER DEFAMATION CLAIM AGAINST THE EMPLOYER THE WITNESSES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE INVESTIGATION AND THE VICTIM OF HARASSMENT THEMSELVES. BECAUSE THE DEFINITION OF AGGRIEVED PERSON IN THIS BILL INCLUDES ANYBODY WHO WAS FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE EMPLOYER THAT ALSO INCLUDES THE HARASSER THEMSELVES AND WE DON'T WANT TO RE HIRE OR EVEN HAVE THEM RE APPLY. FOR EMPLOYMENT WITH US AFTER WE'VE ALREADY ENGAGED INVESTIGATION AND FOUND THAT THE ENGAGED IN HARASSMENT AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT SAYS WE HAVE TO RE HIRE THEM WHICH I AGREE WITH BUT THE CHALLENGES IF YOU I DON'T HAVE A NO REHIRE PROVISION IN YOUR CONTRACT IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. AND YOU JUST HAVE SOMETHING LET'S SAY IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT IN THE SYSTEM INDICATES THIS PERSON IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RE HIGHER THEY APPLY AND WE DON'T INTERVIEW THEM OR WE SAY YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RE HIGHER WITH THIS COMPANY. THAT'S THAN A POTENTIAL RETALIATION COMPLAINT FOR FILING AGAINST THE DEFAMATION COMPLAINT THAT THEY FELL BECAUSE THEY WERE ENGAGED IN HARASSMENT AND WE'VE HIRED THEM FOR BE ENGAGING IN HARASSMENT SO IT'S LIKE THE CYCLE. THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ENGAGE IN WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S ALREADY SHOWN A PROPENSITY TO FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST EMPLOYER EVEN THOUGH THE ENGAGED IN LAWFUL CONDUCT THEMSELVES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS TOO BROADLY WORDED AS IT IS RIGHT NOW. TO INCLUDE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO I HAVE ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN UNLAWFUL OFFENSIVE CONDUCT WERE TERMINATED FOR THAT AND NOW THEY CAN COME BACK AND RE APPLY AND THEN AGAIN FILED ANOTHER LAWSUIT AGAINST THE EMPLOYER. IN THIS VICIOUS CYCLE SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSE. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIGHT BELOW FOR THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAW COUNCIL AND THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AS PRESENTED THE FACTS FROM THE CHP EMPLOYER OUTRAGEOUS. BUT THE BILL IS PLAINLY IN MY VIEW OVER BROAD IT APPLIES TO ANY COMPLAINT INTERNALLY FILED WITH THE COMPANY FOR ANY EMPLOYMENT TO SPEND. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GARDEN VARIETY EMPLOYMENT DISPUTES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE AT THAT COHORT OF EMPLOYEES WILL BE BAKING THE EMPLOYER TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS GUY HE'S OBNOXIOUS HE'S ABUSIVE. HE HAS ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS AND WE FINALLY MAKE A DEAL. TO TERM BUT TO SEPARATE FROM THE EMPLOYEE AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CLARIFYING WE DON'T WANT YOU BACK. SO IT IT HAS TO BE POSSIBLE TO CRAFT THIS BILL MORE NARROWLY TO RESPOND TO THE OUTRAGEOUS. OF FACTS THAT WERE PRESENTED MOST OF WHOM RELATED -- TO PUBLIC ENTITIES BY THE WAY BUT THE ADDITIONAL -- THING I WOULD SAY IS THE USE OF THESE NO RE HIGHER IS NOT UNIVERSAL AS WHICH WAS PRESENTED I HAVE LISTENED -- TO HR AND LEGAL EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS TALK ABOUT HOW TO USE THEM WHEN TO USE THEM HOW TO CRAFT THEM NARROWLY TO AVOID THE EXISTING STATUTE. CASE LAW PROBLEMS BUT AGAIN WHEN WE FINALLY GET RID OF A BAD EMPLOYEE WE DON'T WANT THE PERSON BACK AND AND YOU I I SHOULD THINK WE COULD ALL AGREE ON THAT. JUST AS WE CAN AGREE THAT THE CHP OFFICERS -- VICTIMIZATION WAS OUTRAGEOUS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT MORE NARROWLY CRAFTED. ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. FIFTH FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY SPEED RESPECTFULLY ALIGNER COMMENTS WITH THOSE IN THE SPIRIT MISTER BELOW OPPOSED.

ACTIONS TO PASS STONE. HI STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHOW. CHOW I CHIU. GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN [inaudible] KALRA [inaudible] KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE NO PETRIE-NORRIS RAYS. RACE I ON CALL. THAT BILLS ON CALL WE NEED TO MORE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. FOR NEXT LAST FILM I HAVE THREE MORE ACTUALLY I'LL TAKE A A. B. TWELVE SEVENTY I HAVE ONE MORE BILL AND THEN TO COMMITTEE BILL SO TAKE UP AB. TWELVE SEVENTY WHICH IS WITH RESPECT TO THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT THAT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO STRENGTHEN THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT BY PROTECTING WHISTLE BLOWERS CUT AND CUT BUYING SOME CONFUSING COURT CASES. WELL STRENGTHENING SOME ENFORCEMENT MEASURES. AND EXPANDING THE ABILITY OF THE AUTHORITY THE ACT TO INCLUDE TAX FRAUD CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA THERE'S A GAP I TAX GAP THEY CALL IT AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S OWED IN TAXES AND WHAT'S BEING PAID. THE GAP IS ABOUT POTENTIALLY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS VERY INTERESTED IN HELPING US GO AFTER THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF VARIOUS AREAS WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE CLEANING UP THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROVIDING APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS AND BEING ABLE TO GO AFTER FRAUD AND SOME OF THE ABUSES NOW I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BY THIS -- ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT -- TO CHANGES THAT MAY BE MADE BY CONTRACTORS AND OTHERS THIS IS CLEARLY FOUR CASES OF FRAUD WHERE THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED NOT FOR CASES OF DISPUTES UNDER NORMAL CONTRACTING SITUATIONS SO WE'RE HAPPY TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO WORK THAT THROUGH ALTHOUGH I THINK THE BILL IS FAIRLY CLEAR. THAT WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING OUR FRAUDULENT SITUATIONS AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF DAMAGES ENFORCEMENT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR EITHER. THE MOTION A SECOND SO. HI AM ANTHONY LIVE FROM THE AG'S OFFICE AND EIGHTY IS PLEASE TO SPONSOR AB TWELVE SEVENTEEN IS THE MEASURE THAT. STRENGTHENS THE CALIFORNIA FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND THE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PROTECTING -- COMBATING FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND TAXPAYERS IN WITH ME OF MARTIN GO YET ALSO FROM DOJ. TO TALK ABOUT THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS MARTIN GLAD I HAD THE FALSE CLAIMS UNIT IN THE TWENTY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND WE SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY TO GET MONEY BACK FROM PEOPLE WHO CHEAT THE STATE -- AND WE ALSO WANT TO DETER OTHER PEOPLE FROM DOING THAT IN THE FUTURE. ARE THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT HAS BEEN A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. MY UNIT IS SO FAR RECOVERED APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. WELL THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT. I SHOULD ALSO ADD THAT. THE WORK OF OUR UNIT HAS NOT COME OUT OF THE STATE BUDGET WE ARE ENTIRELY SELF FUNDED FROM OUR RECOVERY -- THAT WILL REMAIN IN SO IN THE FUTURE AND ANY WORK WE DO PURSUING TAX FRAUD WILL BE ENTIRELY SELF FUNDED -- I I KNOW THAT ISSUE HAS BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE JURY ALL THE STANDARD -- THE ISSUE IS ABOUT DEFENDANTS WHO TRY TO AVOID LIABILITY. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY LIED AND TRIED TO CHEAT THE STATE. THE STATE PAID THE CLAIM DESPITE KNOWING IT MIGHT BE FALSE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE STATE MIGHT PAY A CLAIM EVEN IF THEY SUSPECT IT'S FALSE. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE REASON ONE VERY GOOD REASON SOMETIMES IF WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE CLAIM WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO TIP OFF THE DEFENDER. SO THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PAY THE CLIENT ANOTHER REASON WOULD BE. AT THEIR PROVIDING A SERVICE THAT CAN'T BE REPLACED THIS NEARBY VULNERABLE POPULATION. THERE MANY MANY KINDS OF REASONS WHY THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY CUT OFF PAYMENT. JUST BECAUSE SOME SAYS THE CLAIM MIGHT BE FALSE I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE. IT PUT THE GOVERNMENT IN THE SITUATION. WHERE IN ORDER TO PRESERVE A POSSIBLE FALSE CLAIM THEY HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY CUT OFF PAYMENT? AS SOON AS SOMEBODY SAYS THERE'S SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE CLAIM. THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE GOVERNMENT IT ALSO WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR THE CONTRACTORS SO. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU A CLARIFICATION MISTER STONE I ASSUME YOU ACCEPT THE IT COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS HI EXCEPT IN THE COMMITTEES MOMENTS THANK YOU. THE NAME THE ENTITLEMENT THE PEPPERONI ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SEEN NONE OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS PAUL THAT FILTER REPRESENTING -- THIS IS A GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA -- CHAIRMAN STONE ALLUDED TO OUR OPPOSITION LETTER -- FALSE CLAIMS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT IS ONE VERY ESOTERIC AREA THE LAW -- AND SO WE'VE BEEN WATCHING IT FOR MANY YEARS AND BEEN INVOLVED WITH WITH -- CHANGES AND THIS AREA WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE MATERIALITY CHANGE -- IN THAT. RAISES SOME SUBJECTIVE OF QUESTIONS AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF CONSEQUENCE CHILL DAMAGES ON TOP OF ALREADY TREBLE DAMAGES. AND AS THOSE IN. THAT ARE LAWYERS KNOW THAT -- AND THEY'RE A CONTRACT LAW THE REASON YOU SHY AWAY FROM -- CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IS BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT SUBJECT OF TO PROVE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE MIGHT BE WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CHAIRMAN STONE ON THIS ISSUE. A C. WITHOUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE OTHER ON ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO RAISE THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION [inaudible] SEEING NONE. I SEE NO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE WHICH I CLOSE MISTER STONE I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT FRAUD DAMAGES ESSENTIALLY ARE CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH. TO DRAW THAT DISTINCTION THERE BUT I HAVE TO KEEP TALKING TO THE RIGHT I DON'T THINK THIS BILL DOES WHAT RAISES THE CONCERNS THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT I I RESPECT THE THE TIME THAT THEY HAVE PUT INTO AND SO WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S A WAY OF OF PARSING. THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ACTUALLY BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF FRAUD. BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ISLANDS [inaudible] I'M SECRETARY. MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS STONE.

THAT THEY NEED FOR THIS BILL IS FAIRLY RECENT THERE'S A HOLDER RULE WHICH ALLOWS INTO CONSUMER CONTACTS. TO FOR A CONSUMER TO GO AFTER NOT ONLY. A FRAUDULENT. TRANSACTION BUT ALSO THE LOANER OF THAT FRAUDULENT TRANSACTION THERE WAS A RECENT THIRD DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS THAT TURNED THAT AROUND ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO ATTORNEYS FEES.

WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND THANK YOU AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS WILL ALLOW SOMEONE ESSENTIALLY TO GO IN AND COPY RECORDS WITH A CELL PHONE WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY WITH RIGHT NOW SOMEBODY WHO GOES IN WANTS TO SEE RECORDS. HAS TO ASK THE AGENCY TO PROVIDE COPIES AND THOSE COPIES CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE THIS WOULD ALLOW SOMEBODY TO COME IN. WITH PRETTY MUCH A CELLPHONE DO THEIR OWN SCANNING SOME ISSUES WERE RAISED WITH RESPECT TO HISTORIC DOCUMENTS OR DOCUMENTS SUBJECT TO DAMAGE. THOSE I THINK WE CAN GET AROUND BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY ABSOLUTELY WANT TO PROTECT THOSE DOCUMENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER HAS WRITTEN. REQUESTED THOSE DOCUMENTS AND IS MAKING A COPY OF A RESPECT THOSE. CAN'T TAKE THEM OFF SITE CAN'T OTHERWISE DAMAGE THEM BUT SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE A CELL PHONE TO MAKE COPIES ON THEIR OWN THAT'S WHAT THIS CHANGES AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.
