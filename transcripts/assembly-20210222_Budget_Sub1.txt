MANY OF US HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW COOPER IN NINETEEN IS AN EARTHQUAKE THAT HAS HAPPENED OFF OUR SHORES. AND THAT SOON WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A TSUNAMI OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISES HITTING OUR SHORES. WHAT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE FROM THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION IS THAT PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIANS WERE EXPERIENCING ANXIETY OR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. BUT SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN WE ARE NOW AT FOUR OUT OF TEN CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION. WE ARE SEEING INCREASING NUMBERS AS WELL DISPROPORTIONATELY IN OUR YOUNG ADULTS. THOSE WHO ARE FACING ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS WERE THOSE WHO COME FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE ARE SEEING INCREASED SYMPTOMS AS WELL IN OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT IT TAKES US TO HAVE AN ALL HANDS ON DECK MENTALITY HERE TODAY.

ALL BETWEEN OUR SYSTEMS AND ROUTE THIS INITIAL PHASE WE WERE ALSO CONSULTING WITH OUR PARTNERS AND COLLEAGUES OVER A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE HEALTH CARE FIRED INFECTIONS TEAM AND UTILIZING THE EXPERTISE OF THE HEALTHCARE ACQUIRED INFECTIONS TEAM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. ALL TO OF OUR RESPONSE REALLY WAS AROUND RE OPENING- THIS WAS A YOU KNOW REOPENING TO ADMISSIONS- THIS IS AT THE TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA WAS RE OPENING AS WELL AND WE STARTED TO SEE AN AT YOUR SURGEON CASES IN CALIFORNIA.

AND IS INVOLVED FURTHER CONSULTATIONS WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ACTUALLY VISITS FROM THEIR INFECTION PREVENTION AS I HAVE TO REALLY THINK HER COLLEAGUES AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR ALL THE SUPPORT THEY PROVIDED US THROUGH THIS WEEKEND AND I. AM THIRD STAGE MILLIONS AROUND THE SURGE- WE- EXPERIENCE JUSTICE CALIFORNIA DADDY SURGE DURING THE MONTHS I'VE HAD DECEMBER IN JANUARY. WE SAW SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN CASES ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. INITIALLY STARTED TO SEE THIS RIGHT AFTER THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY- SAW SIGNIFICANT RAMP UP IN OUR STOCK- CASES AND THEN WHICH TRANSLATED INTO POSITIVE CASES AND WE BEGAN WORKING WITH THE ODD TESTING TASKFORCE TO DISCUSS ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN DO. TO HELP MITIGATE AND THIS INCREASE IN AND IN CHASEZ AND ULTIMATELY WE DID IMPLEMENT ANTIGEN TESTING- IN OUR HOSPITALS ON A DAILY BASIS TO HELP US. KIND OF BEEN THAT CURVES- IF YOU WELL OVER THE COURSE THE PANDEMIC NINE THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE HAVE HAD ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN PATIENTS STATEWIDE WHO HAVE BEEN POSITIVE FOR COVER NINETEEN. 68% OF THOSE OCCURRED DURING THIS DECEMBER AND JANUARY SEARCH. SHE DID TO THE INCREASE CASES DURING THE SURGE WE SAW AS A STAFFING CHALLENGES AS WELL WORK WITH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD CHANGE BIRDS AT SEA NURSING STAFFING TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE COULD. MAINTAIN OUR OUR NURSING RATIOS AND REQUIRED STAFFING. AND WE ALSO ASSIGN IMPACT TO ADMISSIONS AGAIN DURING THIS TIME I DO TOO THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WE HAD ON QUARANTINE AS WELL AS IMPACTS AND INCOME THE POSITIVE ACTIVITY IN IN OUR ADMISSION OBSERVATION UNITS.

AND 80% OF OUR PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED AT LEAST THEIR FIRST AS MANY NOW HAVE RECEIVED THEIR SECOND DOSE. WITH THE COMBINATION OF OUR INFECTION CONTROL EFFORTS ARE DALY ANTIGEN TESTING AND OUR HIGH VACCINATION RATES WE'VE SEEN A SUBSTANTIAL AND RAPID DECLINE IN THE NEW POSITIVE CASES IN THE RECENT WEEKS. IN FACT IN THE LAST SEVEN DAYS I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE'VE HAD ZERO POSITIVE PATIENT CASES- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE AND THAT WAS A NEW ADMISSION WHO CAME IN FROM- CDC ARE.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TODAY IN THIS IN CALL. AS OUTLINED IN YOUR HEARING AGENDA YOU'RE AWARE OF MANY OF THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS THAT HAVE ARISEN BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. I DO I DO WANT TO JUST YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE THE WORK THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND OTHERS HAVE DONE. TO REALLY STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO MENTAL HEALTH WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PARTNER WITH THEM. ON THE CAL HOPE PROJECT AND SOME OF THEIR OTHER INITIATIVES AND SO WE'VE SEEN A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE FROM OUR STATE PARTNERS AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. DESPITE THAT AS YOU'RE AWARE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE DATA THAT ARE IN THERE WE'RE SEEING TREMENDOUS INCREASE NEED. YOU MENTIONED THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION'S WORK. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOSS OF TRADITIONAL SUPPORTS PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN. ATTENDING SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN LIKE ATTENDING WORK FOR ADULTS. GIVES US SOME OF THE RESILIENCY FACTORS THAT CAN HELP US DEAL WITH STRESS AND TRAUMA. AND MANY MANY OF OUR MEMBERS PARTICULAR MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES HAVE LOST THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RATES OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT THAT ARE I NOTICED AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE YOU CYNICAL ACTIVE SO OFTEN REPORTED BY OUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONS AND OUR TEACHERS- THE WORK CONCERNED ABOUT THE EDUCATIONAL SETBACKS THAT CHILDREN HAVE FACED BECAUSE THAT THE PANDEMIC. AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO MOVE AWAY FROM SCHOOL INTO PROVIDING ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR THEIR FAMILIES PARTICULARLY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IF NOT EXPLICITLY. AND AS YOU MENTIONED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FACING. OFTEN DEVASTATING IMPACTS. IN TERMS OF THE STRESS THAT THEY'RE UNDER THE ECONOMIC STRESS HEALTHCARE STRESS. AND LIMITED ACCESS TO CARE. CERTAINLY ESSENTIAL WORKERS WERE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF S. U. D. NEED SUBSTANCE USE NEEDS- GOING UNREPORTED OR ME OR THEY'RE BEING ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO ACCESSING S. UT SERVICES. THE SHIP THE VIRTUAL CARE WHICH WE'RE VERY PROUD OF HOW QUICKLY ARE COUNTY PARTNERS AND THE STATE HAS BEEN ABLE TO FACILITATE THAT SHIFT THE RITUAL CARE. BUT IT'S AN UNCERTAIN IMPACT IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES SOME OF OUR COMMERCIAL PROVIDERS ARE TELLING US THAT AS MANY AS 80% OF THE CARE THAT THEY'RE DELIVERING FOR MENTAL HEALTH IS THROUGH VIRTUAL PLATFORMS- BUT WE'RE ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR CAN FACE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES. IN ACCESSING CONFIDENTIALMENTAL HEALTH CARE YOU VIRTUAL MEANS BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT HAVE A PRIVATE SPACE FOR WHICH TO ENGAGE WITH THE THERAPISTS TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THEY'RE FACING THE CHECK LET THOSE CHALLENGES ARE RELATED TO THEIR FAMILY. AND OF COURSE IS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SUICIDE RISKS AND SUICIDE RATES. M. I WILL SHARE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS A PROJECT ON MENTAL HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE. AND EVERY EMPLOYER THAT WE HAVE TALKED TO INCLUDING STATE AGENCIES IS CONCERNED ABOUT ACCESS TO CARE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND SO WHILE MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE TALK ABOUT. OUR OUR- WE'RE SEEING THROUGH PUBLIC PROGRAMS THROUGH MEDICARE SYSTEMS WE'RE ALSO SEEING THESE CHALLENGES FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE AND HAVE CONTINUED TO RECEIVE. AN INCOME TO THEIR JOBS I'M EVERY EMPLOYER WE TALKED TO HAS SAID THAT THEY ARE FACING TREMENDOUS MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. AND DIP AND FACING DIFFICULTY IN SUPPORTING THEIR EMPLOYEES. THE PANDEMIC IT'S REALLY RUBIO HOW FRAGILE OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AS AND IT THAT IT ALSO HAS REVEALED THE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN THOSE SYSTEMS. IN A JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CONCERNS OKAY THAT'LL COME UP IN MY TESTIMONY TODAY AROUND HOMELESSNESS AROUND SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. AROUND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE- WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN A CRISIS MODE. YEAH AND WE'RE WE'RE QUICKLY GETTING THROUGH THIS CRISIS AS THE STATE MAKES PROGRESS IN TERMS OF VACCINE RATES AND RECOVERY RATES AND TREATMENT. FOR KOBE BUT THAT IT'S UNCLEAR THAT WERE ACTUALLY READY FOR THE POST. PANDEMIC MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THAT OUR STATE WILL HAVE. RESEARCH ON OTHER CRISIS SHOWS THAT WE SEE. A LACK THREE TO OFTEN THREE TO FIND YOUR LACK. OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS COMING OUT OF INVOLVEMENT IN A CRISIS I'M THAT WITH SMALLER SCALE THAN THIS PANDEMIC AND SO. IT IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW WE WILL RESPOND TO THE POST PANDEMIC MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THROUGH OUR SCHOOLS OR WORKPLACES AND SO- I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF SOME OF OUR WORK. I'M I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE. REALLY SEEN THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC THE WAY IN WHICH GOVERNMENT CAN RESPOND IN UNDERSTANDING CODE RATES. IN UNDERSTANDING VACCINATION RATES IN REALLY PUTTING TOGETHER THE RAPID RESPONSE STRATEGIES IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM UNFORTUNATELY OUR CAPACITY TO DO THAT IS MUCH LESS MATURE. BUT IT'S NEEDED NONETHELESS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS A GENERAL STORE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI DR VERONICA KELLY. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS I AM DOCTOR RUNNING TO KELLY I AM THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR ST BERNARDINO COUNTY EACH AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO START BY SAYING OFTENTIMES WE SAYING CRISIS OR DISASTER COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ARE SOME OF THE FIRST FOLKS IN AND UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE AT THE LAST FOLKS OUT. WE ARE OFTEN PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR OVER A YEAR OR LONGER AFTER THE END OF A COMMUNITY DEVASTATING EVENT JUST CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF A REGULAR DISASTER LIKE OUR FIRES THE CREEK FIRE THE PARADISE FIRE AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS KNOWS ALL TOO WELL OUR DECEMBER SECOND TERRORIST ATTACK HERE IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY IN WHICH MY STAFF WORKED FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS PROVIDING SUPPORT TO FOLKS WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THAT. AND NATIONALLY THERE ARE FEW DEDICATED FUNDING STREAMS THAT ARE FOCUSED SOLELY ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORTS AND HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE LUCKY THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF COUNTY BASED HIP HOP DEPARTMENTS. THAT HAVE FOR A LONG TIME OPERATED TO PROVIDE MUTUAL AID TO ONE ANOTHER ON A PRETTY MUCH VOLUNTARY SELF FINANCED AND SELF COORDINATED BASIS. WHEN COUNTIES IMPACTED FOR EXAMPLE WITH AN EARTHQUAKE OR FIRE COUNTIES PROVIDE MUTUAL AID TO ONE ANOTHER TO SUPPORT EMERGENCY PERSONNEL AND THE AFFECTED COMMUNITY. TAKE THE RIDGECREST TRONA EARTHQUAKE A FEW YEARS AGO WE WORKED WITH INYO COUNTY KERN COUNTY AND SAMPOERNA DINO COUNTY TO PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORT TO THE ENTIRE REGION HELPING ONE ANOTHER. BUT WHEN THIS DISASTER CAME FOR COBIT. AT OUR OWN SUPPORT OF ONE ANOTHER IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STARTED PROVIDING MUTUAL AID TO OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND WE HAD TO FOCUS ON RELIEVING PRESSURE FROM THE HOSPITAL EDIE'S AND IN SOME COUNTIES LIKE MINE WE STOOD UP A SKILLED NURSING TASK FORCE. SO THAT WE COULD ASSIST BASED ON THE RIVER SIDE MODEL ENSURING THAT STAFF REMAINED AT THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES CARING FOR OUR ELDERS RATHER THAN LEAVE THEM TO DIE. AND WHILE STATEWIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISASTER PLANS NOTE THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS THERE TO SUPPORT OTHERS IN A DISASTER THERE'S NO MENTION OF WHO WILL SUPPORT US. AND ASKED TOBY JUST STATED CO BUT IS REALLY SHONE A LIGHT ON AREAS OF EXTREME CHALLENGE FOR COUNTY ABOUT HOW. WE WOULD ARGUE AT THE SAME TIME THAT IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO TRULY RECOVER FROM THE COLLECTIVE TRAUMA THIS EVENT THAT WE MUST MOVE FORWARD AND REALLY FOCUSING ON BEHAVIOR HEALTH. AND SPECIFICALLY IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH SAFETY NEED. THE STATE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC IN WORKING WITH C. B. H. J. IN OUR MEMBERS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CRITICAL STRESS POINTS WHERE POSSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE DUE TO THE FACT THAT OUR SERVICES ARE COST BASED. THEIR FEE FOR SERVICE ONE OF PROVIDER LIKE A RESIDENTIAL SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. PROVIDER EXPERIENCED AN OUTBREAK OF COBIT. AND THEY NEEDED TO ISOLATE OR QUARANTINE STAFF AND PATIENTS. BILLABLE SERVICES SLOW AND THAT ADDED UNNECESSARY FINANCIAL STRESS TO THE PROVIDERS WHO WERE WORRIED THEY WOULD RUN OUT OF FUNDING AND HAVE TO CLOSE BUT BY IDENTIFYING THESE ISSUES CREEK QUICKLY WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE H. TWO GAS TO SEEK OUT SPECIFIC REGULATORY FLEXIBILITIES TO ALLOW US TO INCREASE SINCE WITHOUT PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS BEYOND WHAT OUR TYPICAL PROTOCOLS ALLOWED IN JC COOPER- TO THAT AND HER PRESENTATION. HOWEVER IN OTHER AREAS WE STRUGGLED WITHOUT ADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR EXAMPLE NURSING HOMES AND HOSPITALS REMAIN AT THE FOREFRONT AND BECAUSE BOTH SETS OF FACILITIES ARE LICENSED UNDER CDPH THEY RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT RESOURCES INCLUDING PRIORITIZATION OF PP AND DESIGNATED ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES HOWEVER MANY OF OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO WORKING WITH CLIENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL HEALTH COMMITTEES AND THEY'RE LIVING IN CONGREGATE CARE AND RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS. YEAH WE A WHOLE PROVIDERS WERE AND CONTINUE TO BE LESS KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD AND DECIDING PRIORITIZATION OF GP WORKFORCE INFECTION CONTROL. GUIDANCE AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS REQUESTED ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT WE REQUESTED THIS VERY EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC TO HELP FUND TECHNOLOGY MOVE US TO A PURELY TELEHEALTH MODEL- AND- OUR- REPEATED REQUESTS WERE DENIED. THE STATE AND OUR BEHEST REQUESTED CMS WAVE THE IMD EXCLUSION INSTITUTE FOR MENTAL DISEASE EXCLUSION WHICH PROHIBITS MEDICAL PAYMENTS MUST BE EVER HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDERS THAT HELP MORE THAN SIXTEEN BEDS. THIS REQUEST WAS TWO ALLOWS ON A TEMPORARY BASIS TO A DRAW DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS THESE REQUESTS WERE ALSO DENIED EACH TIME I SEE A MASS. AND REFERRING TO THE PRESENTATION AT DH CS PROVIDED AMAZING DATA IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE DATA PROVIDED ABOUT WHO IS SERVED BY BOTH MANAGED CARE AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH PLANS BUT A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO. DOES NOT INCLUDE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AND REALLY ONLY FOCUSES ON BILLABLE SERVICES. AT THE SAME TIME AS WE KNOW DURING KOBE WE HAD A LOT OF OTHER IMPACTS OUR STATE HOSPITALS CLOSED AS WE HEARD ABOUT TODAY- AS FAR AS ADMISSIONS WHICH FURTHER LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS. AND WHILE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES DO DIP A LITTLE BIT AND A CRISIS WE FEAR THAT AT SOME POINT THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL NEEDS ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT OUR NATIONAL AND STATE DATA. WE SEEN FENTANYL RELATED OVERDOSES INCREASE AND STAFFING AND THE PHYSICAL PLANT OF WHERE OUR SERVICE IS DELIVERED. ALSO CAUSED A DIFFICULTY IN SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE ARE WE ARE STRUCTURED TO DELIVER SERVICES. AND PROVIDERS ARE REALLY CAUGHT IN A BIND STRUGGLING TO RETAIN THEIR STAFF I'VE HAD THREE OF MY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF DIE OF KOBE IN THE PAST MONTH. WE HAVE HAD COUNTLESS STAFF WHO LOST THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER THEIR PARENT THEIR CHILDREN TO THIS VIRUS AND YET. MANY STILL COME TO WORK. IN FACT IN ONE AREA OF OUR COUNTY IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND VICTORVILLE IN BARSTOW AREA THAT SERVE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND OPEN CASES EVERYONE OF OUR PSYCHIATRIC NURSES HAD KOBE AND THEY WERE ALL OUT AT THE SAME TIME. THESE ARE NURSES WHO GIVE. LONG ACTING ANTI PSYCHOTIC INJECTIONS AND MEDICATED ASSISTED TREATMENT TO OUR CLIENTS THERE WAS NO ONE TO PROVIDE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE LOCAL PHARMACIES AND OUR PHARMACISTS DID THAT WORK FOR US FOR THE TWO WEEKS THAT WE HAD NURSES OUT FOR KOBE. WE HAD NO NURSES IN ANY OTHER PART OF OUR COUNTY TO MOVE UP THE HILL. AND WHERE IS THIS THE STATE'S MOHAWKS THE MEDICAL HEALTH OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATOR. OUT REALLY WAS STRUCTURE TO SUPPLY HIGHLY SKILLED HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL DURING SUCH CRISES. THEY DON'T HAVE PSYCHIATRIC. AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT OUR PSYCHIATRIC NURSES AND OTHER STAFF WHO ARE NEEDED FOR A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES. ARE NOT ABLE TO- OF BE LEVERAGED IN SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE AT THE- PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITY A FIFTEEN BED FACILITY AND FIRST THEY HAD TO CLOSE BECAUSE ALL OF THEIR STAFF GOT KOBE. SHORTLY THEREAFTER THEY RE OPENED ONLY TO HAVE AN OUTBREAK WITH ALL OF THEIR PATIENTS. ONLY NOW ARE THEY OUT OF QUARANTINE. BUT IT HAS NOW RESULTED IN LONG LASTING EFFECTS ON THE WORK FORCE AND THEIR CO FOURTEEN FOUR PEOPLE AT A TIME TO COME IN IMAGINE DOING THAT AND ANY OTHER ROUND OF HEALTH CARE. THAT YOU WOULD ONLY TAKE FOR WOMEN IN MATERNITY CARE BACK TO THE BIRTHING CENTER WHEN YOU HAVE FOUR RIGHT ONE COMES AND THEY'RE IN LABOR YOU HAVE TO WAIT WE'RE GONNA WAIT WE HAVE TOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO GO BACK. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DEALING. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT OUR STATE PARTNERS HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO MAKE UP. THE STRUCTURAL GAPS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND WHAT. WE HAVE RECEIVED AN REGULATORY FLEXIBILITIES AND GUIDANCE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THEIR DEDICATION AND PERSISTENCE IN OVERCOMING THESE BARRIERS. BUT THE FACT IS AT THE END OF THE DAY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAD TO FIGHT. ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENTS. ARE WORK FORCES AND OUR SERVICES EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. MOST OF OUR CONGREGATE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY DCS AND CDS THAT'S NOT. A CALIFORNIA PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. LIKE A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OR HOSPITAL. AND SO IT WAS ALMOST A YEAR INTO THE PANDEMIC BEFORE THE STATE WAS ABLE TO GATHER ALL OF THOSE THREE ENTITIES TOGETHER SO WE CAN BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT. HEALTH IMPACTS. AND THESE GAPS PERSIST. WELL INDIVIDUALS AS WAS NOTED EARLIER BY DR WARBURTON. AND HAVE. WITH US SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDER HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST RISK OF MORTALITY TO COOK IN NINETEEN ONLY BEHIND H. THE UP. STATE BAXEEN PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY CALL OUT INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AND THAT WILL MEAN THAT WE WILL NEED TO FIGHT ONCE AGAIN TO ENSURE OUR HIGH RISK CLIENTS CAN GET IN THE QUEUE FOR VACCINES. WE HAD TO LIFT UP OUR OWN VACCINE CLINICS FOR STAFF IN OUR BUREAU HEALTH NURSES WHO ARE EXPERTS ARE OFTEN USED ELSEWHERE ALL OF MY NURSES KNOW HOW TO GIVE A VACCINE. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN SUPPORTING OUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. WE WORK HARD TO DIVERT BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISES FROM OUR PARTNERS IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. FEDERAL LAW DOES MANDATE THAT HOSPITALS. ARE TO ADDRESS ALL FORMS OF EMERGENCY THE ENTER THEIR FACILITY INCLUDING PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY. BUT THE COMBINATION OF COBIT OUTBREAKS AT THE HIGHER LEVEL LOWER LEVELS OF CARE. ALONG WITH SPACING AND DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS AND LACK OF PP AND INCREASED DEMAND WITH NO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- AND PROVIDERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ACCEPTING COLEMAN POSITIVE PATIENTS HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT BOTTLENECK SO THAT WE HAVE PATIENTS WHO ARE NEED TO QUARANTINE. AND PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS AND THE STATE'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITHOUT RECEIVING PSYCHIATRIC CARE FURTHER IMPACTING THEIR PSYCHIATRIC. SYMPTOMS IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TYPICAL LENGTH OF STAY IN A PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITY IS UNDER TWO WEEKS SEVEN CODE POSITIVE INDIVIDUAL CASTING A QUARANTINE TWO WEEKS BEFORE THEY GET ADMITTED ENTIRE LENGTH OF STAY IS SPENT IN QUARANTINE. AT A HOSPITAL AWAITING ADMISSION NOT MEETING MEDICAL NECESSITY NOT BEING ABLE TO BE BUILT. IN PART BECAUSE OF THE STAFFING ISSUES AND THE LACK OF EXTERNAL RESOURCES CAN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS RELIED ON LOCUM TENENS TO HELP US STAFF AND LOCUM TENENS ARE BEYOND EXPENSIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR KELLY NEXT WE HAVE MICHELLE GERBER. GOOD AFTERNOON ED SHEERAN MEMBERS MACHEL CAPITA ALSO WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND IWOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ORGANIZING TODAY'S HEARING FOCUSED ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- IT WITH THAT EARLIER THAT ARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SAFETY NET IS GRADUAL AND I THINK WHAT DR KELLY LAID OUT REALLY- DEMONSTRATE JUST HOW STRONG THE SAFETY NET HAS BEEN AND RESILIENT- IT'S IN IT'S UNDER REPRESENTATION AROUND COORDINATED RESPONSE EFFORT. I WILL SPEAK TO THE LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED TO DATE AND PROVIDES SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE STATE TO CONSIDER- AS LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC SO FAR- ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSCORE IS THE BI DIRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION WHICH RESEARCHERS ARE FINDING EMERGING BETWEEN COPE AT NINETEEN AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IT APPEARS THAT COOK AT NINETEEN- MAY BOTH TRIGGER THANK YOUNG TECH ILLNESS. AND ALSO INDIVIDUALS WITH- MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COPE IN NINETEEN INTERACTION AND MORTALITY WE THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP AN EYE ON AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND THINK ABOUT PRIORITIZATION RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO COOK AT NINETEEN- THERE IS ALSO AS WE WILL HEAR ABOUT IN THE HEARING OF THE WINNING. EPIDEMIC OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC BOTH OPIOIDS AS WELL AS DRUGS OTHER DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND- ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS WILL HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON OUR STATE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME- SO MUCH OF THE BROADER EFFORT TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS HAS REALLY BEEN ABOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE HAVE A LIMITED CAPACITY OF HOSPITAL TO ADDRESS THE PHYSICAL HEALTH NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH A COOK AT NINETEEN- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE WE FALLING SHORT. IT'S BEEN ADEQUATELY UNDESTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES AND ILLNESS AND THOSE THEIR VERY THING HOSPITALS AND SO- WE BELIEVE THAT LIVING. WE NEED TO REALLY. PSYCHIATRIC IN TECH AND- THANK YOU THIRD PLANNING RELATED TO COST AND- WE SAW WITH THE PANDA- THAT THERE. THAT THAT ARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AT ALL LEVELS OF HIGHER LEVEL AS WELL AS LOWER LEVELS OF ACUTE LEVEL WERE IMPACTED BY COBIT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS AND SO. THERE NEEDS TO BE- SOME PLANNING DONE AROUND THAT THE SERVICES ARE BOTH MEDICAL AS WELL AS NON MEDIC HELD DUE TO THE I AND D. EXCLUSION WHICH DR KELLY REFERENCED. AND SO- OUR OUR COMMUNITY OF PROVIDERS HAVE REALLY ADJUSTED AS THEY CAN BUT WITH VERY LITTLE SUPPORT AND NO EXTRA RESOURCING TO DO SO- THE PHYSICAL PLANT OF THE FACILITIES IS. ALREADY SMALL AGAIN BECAUSE OF HOW WE ARE HE'D AND THE FEDERAL RULES FOR PAYMENT AND SO- ANY ADDITIONAL CAPACITY WOULD REQUIRE AN INTENTIONAL AND DEDICATED RESOURCE- TO ADDRESS OUR UNIQUE SYSTEM- WHEN IT COMES TO OF FOR EXAMPLE ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES. OR A HOUSING WHICH WAS PROVIDED BY THE STATE THERE WERE DISCRIMINATORY BARRIERS PUT IN PLACE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL AS LOCALLY WHICH- LOOTED OUR CLIENTS FROM ACCESSING THOSE RESOURCES ON PAR WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT MOVING FORWARD- AND WITH RESPECT TO FUNDING AGAIN THERE NEEDS TO BE DEDICATED RESOURCE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITIES AND PROVIDERS AND SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF THE CATEGORICAL NATURE OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FUNDING. WHICH LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO- MOVE FUNDING AROUND OR DRAW FROM DIFFERENT AS FUNDING STREAMS IN AN EMERGENCY SUCH AS THIS ONE- MOVING FORWARD IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR MORE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EXPERTISE TO BE BROUGHT IN STATE. DISASTER AND PUBLIC HOW TO. AT A MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL- IS IT IMPORT WITHIN CITY PH AND- YES AS THEY ARE THE HEART OF THE STATE'S DISASTER COMMANDING CONTROL. BUT WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO ALSO CONSIDER RECRUITING AND EMBEDDING MORE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINICAL EXPERTISE ACROSS ALL THE KEY DEPARTMENTS WHICH TOUCH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INCLUDING. THE STD PH YES S. AND OF COURSE EMERGENCY SERVICES. REGARDLESS OF THE INTERNAL EXPERTISE THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION ACROSS THE STATE. AS DR KELLY MENTIONED THE- ALL BE HERE HALL FACILITY IT'S CALLED WHICH WERE LIFTED UP WITH LEADERSHIP FROM- DTS AGENCY I AM PROUD IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND- SOCIAL SERVICES PARTNERS. WAS IN A VERY OVERDUE AND WELCOME- TOUCHPOINT FOR HOURS FIELD. AND WE DO NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT CONSISTENTLY NAMING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF THE FACILITIES AND CLIENTS SPECIFICALLY IN OUR COBIT RELATED STATE GUIDANCE. THAT TARGET RESOURCE ALLOCATION WHETHER IT'S HOUSING BAXEEN. KEEPS I GREG BE UPDATED FOR GUY ON PURE BACK PRIOR TO. TECHNICALLY WE WERE ARGUE IN INCLUDE OF HEALTH CLIENTS BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT NAME LIKE US HEALTH. ARE LIKE IN THE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE IT WILL MAKE IT THAT MUCH HARDER FOR US TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT EIGHTEEN- THERE DO PRIORITIZATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THESE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE EASILY REMEDIED BY HELPING US NAME THEM SPECIFICALLY- MOVING FORWARD STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR WORK FIRST COORDINATION AND RESOURCES FROM ALL WALKS. YOU NEED TO BE REVISED TO INCORPORATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE AS AN OPTION IN A CRISIS. AND WE NEED TO WORK TO DEVELOP A MORE COMPREHENSIVE HERE HOPE WORKFORCE STRATEGY COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC TO TRULY IN NEED. OF THE ON COMING TO NAMI WHICH YOU MENTIONED CHAIR ARAMBULA- OUR WORK TO CONTINUE TELEHEALTH AND IMPLEMENT PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST THE MEDIC HOW WILL NOT BE ENOUGH WE WILL DESPERATELY NEED ADDITIONAL CLINICIANS AS WELL THROUGHOUT THE CONTINUUM INCLUDING PSYCHIATRISTS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN. NURSES AND OTHER LICENSED AND CERTIFIED STAFF- WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE MOVING FORWARD REGARDLESS AT TELEHEALTH WELL IT CAN HAVE ITS LIMITATIONS PARTICULARLY THE VERY A Q. POPULATION- WILL NEED TO BE ACCORDED WITH AN ACTUAL- ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT VERY LOW INCOME POPULATIONS MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. PRIVATELY OR INTERNET ACCESS TO EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE IN TELEHEALTH SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE WOULD. ASK FOR A POLICYMAKERS TO CONSIDER MOVING% FORWARD AND THEN WE WILL NEED TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH INSURERS BOTH MEDICAL AND NON MEDICAL ARGUING AGGRESSIVE. OUTREACH TO THEIR BENEFICIARY CHANGE- THE STATE ARE BENEFICIARY NO AND- NOT. FROM SERVICE- AND OFTEN. OF THE FOUR CONTENT REALLY DOES NEED TO STEP FORWARD IN THIS MOMENT- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR TARGETING INVESTMENT IN- CAL GAME R. AS WELL AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET. TO REALLY HELP BOLSTER THE FULL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON AS PART OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDING THE IMD WAIVER PROPOSAL WHICH WE THINK WILL ALL BE HELPFUL IN SHORING UP OUR SYSTEM COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERYONE WHO IS ON THE PANEL I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR MEMBERS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUNS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND- THANK YOU FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE MEMBERS- IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD SPEAK TO ISSUE THREE- I HAVE A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THAT. AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTERS ON THIS ISSUE ONE I'M SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND THE COMPONENTS OF THOSE AT THE FRONT LINES AT THE LOCAL LEVELS CONTINUING TO WORK. ON THOSE AREAS. MISTER CHAIR AND THOSE THAT WOULD PRESENT A NON ISSUE- THREE ON THE RISK OF SUICIDE AND SELF HARM. IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE ACROSS OUR STATE AND IS ESPECIALLY HIGH AMONG ADOLESCENTS OLDER ADULTS VETERANS AND LGBT Q. USE AN ADULT'S KOVEN NINETEEN HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE CALLS TO CRISIS HOTLINES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND IN CALIFORNIA IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THAT AN OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION IS MUCH NEEDED AND IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA I INTRODUCED A BILL TWENTY ONE TWELVE LAST YEAR THEY GOT SIGNED INTO LAW. THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED OF ALL THESE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY AND SPECIFICALLY- WAS SUICIDE PREVENTION. BUT ALSO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN ESSENTIAL AND CRITICAL COMPONENT- FOLLOWING THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. EVEN BEFORE THE CURRENT PANDEMIC SUICIDE RATES AMONG ALL GROUPS HAVE BEEN INCREASING NOW THIS MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS GROWING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF ISOLATION AND UNCERTAINTY. WELL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO ADDRESS SUICIDE RATES COORDINATION OF STATE RESOURCES HAS REMAINED A CHALLENGE FUNDING THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION WILL BE DISCUSSED. AND WILL BE A VITAL STEP FORWARD IN ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS FOR YEARS TO COME. IT IS WITH THIS IN MIND THAT THIS YEAR ARE I WILL BE REQUESTING AN ANNUAL ALLOCATION OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THIS OFFICE AND ENSURE IN THE YEARS TO COME WE CAN BEGIN TO ADDRESS AND THIS CRISIS. AND CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT AND ADVOCATE AROUND THESE ISSUES THAT ARE MUCH NEEDED- WAY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CAME AND NOW- DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN AFTER THIS PANDEMIC. WHY WITH THIS THE OF SUICIDE. CAN ORGANIZE A STATEWIDE RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS. ENSURING WE ARE TAKING DATA DRIVEN APPROACHES TO SUICIDE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION IN ALL COMMUNITIES. AND ASSIST WITH A VITAL ON THE GROUND WORK BEING DONE BY PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STRAIT. EACH YEAR WE DO NOT TAKE THIS STEP IS A YEAR WILL HAVE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP AND HARD IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NEEDED FOR MANY OF THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. WITH CHALLENGES CHALLENGES IN THEIR LIVES FEELING ISOLATED CHALLENGES WITH THEIR IN THEIR LIVES WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THAT MIGHT BE CONTEMPLATING THE ISSUES OF SUICIDE AND DRUG OVERDOSE IN THE AREAS THAT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY DURING THESE PRESENTATIONS. I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS YEAR WE CAN TAKE A STEP FORWARD- THAT IT DEMANDS THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD. AND FUN BY THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. THE FUTURE HOLDS THINGS ARE UNCERTAIN. BUT ONE THING THAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THE SUICIDE. AND THE OVER DRUG OVERDOSES THAT ARE HAPPENING THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY. WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THOSE WILL CONTINUE TO ESCALATE DURING THESE TIMES AND DURING THESE PANDEMICS IT IS WITH THIS IN MIND THAT I FULL HEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE PRIVATE PRISON CHANGES MOVING FORWARD. AND WILL BE REQUESTING THAT TWO MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION TO FUND THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO ALL THE PRISONERS THAT ARE- COMING FORWARD TO HIGHLIGHT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAIR SO THAT AMASSED TWO QUESTIONS. FIRST QUESTION IS GOING TO BE FOR OUR NEXT YEAR OUT I MADE AS THE- ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ASKING ABOUT THE CD R. P. THE **** C. R. D. P. THE REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT. PER THE FIRST STAFF RECOMMENDATION I WANTED TO GET A SENSE IF THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THE PROGRAM HAS VALUE AND THEREFORE WARRANTS. AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL INVESTMENT HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN. THE PROGRAM DOES HAVE VALUE ALL- AND WE'VE SEEN IT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE- AND IF YOU COULD JUST REPEAT THE LAST PART SORRY MR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THEREFORE WARRANTS AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL INVESTMENT. AT THIS POINT I PROBABLY CAN'T I'M GOING TO DETAIL ABOUT THAT IF IT WEREN'T I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IT DOES- IT HAS VALUE- WE WILL SEE MORE AT I PROGRESSIVE. MY HOPE WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUR DEPARTMENTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT FOR BRIDGE FUNDING. SO THAT WE CAN THEN DO THE APPROPRIATE ANALYSES THAT ARE GOING TO BE DONE WITHIN PHASE TWO. AND SO HOPE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH. THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO CONTINUE WHAT I AM WOULD AGREE IS A VALUED PROGRAM AND ONE THAT. DOES NEED CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVESTMENT AND SO- WITH THAT I HOPE WE HAVE THAT CHANCE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. I DO WANNA ASK THE ADMINISTRATION I THOUGHT A POWERFUL FROM C. B. H. T. A. TO MENTION THE BI DIRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN COVERED NINETEEN AND- MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND WAS HOPING TO GET- RESPONSE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. ON WHY MENTAL HEALTH WERE SPECIFICALLY SCHIZOPHRENIA IS NOT EXPLICITLY CALLED OUT IN TERMS OF VACCINE PRIORITIZATION. WE WOULD NEEDED THE PART TO OUR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. OVERSEAS ACTING PRIORITIZATION. SO WITH THAT WE MADE TABLE THAT QUESTION FOR NOW AND COME BACK TO IT I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING VERY MUCH PANEL ONE NOW WE WILL MOVE ON THE PANEL TO ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND PROPOSALS SPECIFIC TO YOU AGAIN- FOR MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER ALL THE PRESENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED WE HAVE EIGHT PRESENTERS AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR LIKE PORN. PLEASE BEGIN- AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON ALL INSURABLE- J. C. IS GOING TO ACTUALLY START WORST PART OF OUR PRESENTATION HERE AND I'LL FOLLOW UP TO OUR SUMMER MARC SHE TAKES. HER BACK. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO INVEST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL FUND TWO HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND. OVER THREE YEARS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS RECEIVING PREVENTIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES OFFERED BY SCHOOL AFFILIATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND THIS PROPOSAL INCENTIVIZES PLANS TO COME TO THE TABLE COLLABORATE WITH SCHOOLS IN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO SERVICES IN SCHOOLS. HISTORICALLY THERE'S BEEN LIMITED OF CORONATION BETWEEN MANAGED CARE PLANS COUNTIES IN SCHOOLS AROUND PROVIDING SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. EACH ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VERY SPECIFIC SETS OF SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH VARIOUS DELIVERY SYSTEMS THE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THOSE HISTORICAL BARRIERS BUILD PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THESE ENTITIES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO SCHOOL CHILDREN. I THINK ONE EXAMPLE THAT. WE ARE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH IS FOR EXAMPLE 58% OF OUR ELEAZAR IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDE ELLIE A BILLING OPTION PROGRAM SERVICES- THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS ELEAZAR TO BE REIMBURSED FOR CERTAIN HEALTH SERVICES. IN A SCHOOL SETTING- HOWEVER ELLY ELLS ELLY AIDS CAN ONLY BE REIMBURSED FOR SERVICES TO A CHILD WITH THE CARE PLAN. DH CS IS INTERESTED IN ULTIMATELY INCREASING ACCESS TO ALL APPROPRIATE MEDICAL SERVICES IN SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW IN LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND RESPONSE- AROUND NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL BUT HOPE IT REACHES BROADER THAN THAT IN THE FUTURE. ANOTHER PIECE WE WOULD JUST MENTION. IS THAT WE HAVE HEARD OF FOR VERY LONG TIME THE NUMBER OF. YEARS OF THAT MAY BE IN PLACE AND WE'RE HOPING TO KIND OF REMOVE SOME OF THOSE WITH THESE INCENTIVE HE SAYS AND THAT'S- WHY THEY ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON INTERVENTIONS THAT FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE. PARTNERSHIP TO PASS THE BUILDING AND REMOVING SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WOULD BE USED FOR THINGS LIKE. PLANNING CONSULTANTS TO COME IN AND WORK WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PROVIDERS IN THE SCHOOLS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PATH FORWARD SHOULD BE IT WOULD PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND DATA SYSTEMS IT COULD ALSO PROVIDE THINGS LIKE TELEHEALTH PORTALS. OR MODELS OF CARE FOR APPROPRIATE SCHOOL SETTINGS. DO YOU IS ALSO VERY FOCUSED ON EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CARE MANY OF THE PROPOSED INCENTIVES FOCUS ON REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES. FOR EXAMPLE HIGHER INCENTIVES MAY BE OFFERED FOR CLOSING HEALTH EQUITY GAPS FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER AND LGBTQ STUDENTS WITHIN THE PROPOSAL. INCENTIVES WILL NOT- INCLUDE PAYMENTS FOR TREATMENT SERVICES WOULD YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR TO PEOPLE THAT CAN BE REIMBURSED TODAY- AND WOULD BE SEPARATE FROM THESE INCENTIVE DOLLARS. THE MODEL WOULD BE FLEXIBLE TO ALLOW FOR SCHOOL AFFILIATED PROVIDERS I'M INCLUDING PROVIDERS IN SCHOOLS COUNTY- PROVIDERS SCHOOL AFFILIATED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS WITHIN THE SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT ALL OF THE SYSTEM'S EXISTING CALIFORNIA I MEAN WHAT THE PROPOSAL TO BE FLEXIBLE. TO ALLOW FOR ALL OF THOSE MODELS ADDS PLANS SCHOOLS AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN THE SPACE. ADDITIONALLY SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DH CS HAS MET WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AS WELL AS THE PHD A TO DISCUSS HOW WE CAN ALIGN AND LEVERAGE. THEIR VARIOUS EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA TWO BOARDS TOGETHER TO COORDINATE ACROSS ALL OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR ALL CHILDREN TO HAVE THE- LARGEST NUMBER OF SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM IN THEIR SCHOOLS. YES THEY ARE VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THESE DISCUSSIONS OVER THE SUMMER TO HELP INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PER HOST INCENTIVES AS WELL AS THE DISTRIBUTION. AND ALLOCATION OF THOSE INCENTIVE DOLLARS. EACH DEPARTMENT HAS BOTH EXPERTISE AND RELATIONSHIPS. AND THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO LEVERAGING AND PROMOTING. THOSE IN ORDER TO INCREASE AS STUDENT BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY DH CS DID REQUEST LIMITED RESOURCE SERVICES OF TWELVE POSITIONS EQUAL TO ELEVEN MILLION TOTAL FUN TO ADDRESS AND IMPLEMENT THIS WORK. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO WILL NOW DO YOU. HAVE SOME I REMAINING COMMENTS. WELL YOU'RE ON YOUR. YES WE RELY ON J. C. TO KEEP TELLING ME THAT I NEEDED- WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO BEING SHORED UP ALL CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED THEM WITHOUT DELAY- FUNDAMENTALS OF THE MOTIVE OF THE SCHOOLS PROPOSAL IS NOT. MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE ALREADY BEING PAID. WHAT A CAPITATED RATE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DON'T SUCCEED IN MAKING THOSE CONNECTIONS HAPPEN THEN THAT'S NOT LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE. IN TERMS OF HOW WE GO ABOUT. DURING THAT WE GET A HIGH QUALITY CALL BOTH FROM OUR EXISTING. THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS- SCHOOLS- THE CONCEPT IS WE GO THROUGH OUR SORT OF DATA ANALYTICS YOUR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION- BUT ALSO THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT WE'RE NOT- GAUGED IN WITHIN THE PARK- CREATING A SORT OF A OFFICE OF CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER. GOAL WHICH IS TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY GETTING THE OUTCOMES OF. OUR CLIENTS. NEED WE ARE PLANNING FOR- AND- WE ARE ALSO ISSUES OF EQUITY ALL WITHIN THE SORT OF THE BROADER FOCUS ON GETTING SERVICES TO CHILDREN BEYOND ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE. IT WITHIN THE CATALAN PROPOSAL ON MODIFYING THE MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA. IT BARRIER FOR MANY YEARS. WARMER DAYS UNTIL SERVE SOMETHING STRUGGLED RIGHT OUT GET ACCESS TO SERVICES AND CARE THE CHILD NEEDS WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES OR FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. IN TURN OF- YOU CAN CARE WHICH IS TO FOCUS OF COURSE BARBER'S ARM WAS PART OF CAL AIM WE- BROUGHT TOGETHER A- OF FOSTER CARE WORKGROUP THAT IS WORK WITH. ALL OF THE STATE. BOTH DEPARTMENTS- YES SO. AND SOME OF THE JOB MOST PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW DO WE GET TO A SYSTEM THAT IS TRULY COORDINATED INTEGRATED. HIGHLY ACCOUNTABLE. FOR ENSURING THAT ALL ALL HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN ARE BEING WELL GRASSED. CHILDREN AUSTIN CARE. AND THOSE TREATMENTS WILL BE ON THE WERE IN OUR WITH D. O. YES THESE ARE FIVE WORKGROUP CONTINUES THAT WAS WITH WHAT'S CALLED WE EXPECT FIND REPORT ALL THE IN OCTOBER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE- TWO OTHER THINGS ARE QUICKLY BENCH. OF THE AGENTS OR THE AB TWENTY THREE WORK. WHEN TOGETHER. ALL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AS WELL AS BOARD OF EDUCATION TO REALLY WORK AT BOTH STATEWIDE LEVEL CALLS FROM LOCAL LEVELS HOW TO INTEGRATE OPERATIONS SO BUT WE NEVER AGAIN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. CHILDREN ARE SOME GOING. ALMOST SERVED OR UNDER SERVED BECAUSE THE MORE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS. LOCAL YOUR STATE LEVEL ALL OF OUR. PROBABLY SAYING. ONE WILL BE JUST MENTIONED BECAUSE OF FIGHTING AND ALL- WORKING WITH THE BOARD OF SOCIAL. AND THE- FIRST BROKE FINALLY ORDER THE SPA TO PROVIDE CARE AND FORMER BOSS YOUTH IN THEIR CARE. WITH THE MEDIA TRUMP INFORMED SUPPORT WHEN THEY NEED IT TO SORT OF A TWENTY FOUR SO. THIS WHEN. CRISIS A AND TEN O'CLOCK ON THE NIGHT. ALL MY THE CARE GIVERS WILL AND- CHILDREN THEIR CARING FOR CAN. ALL PROGRESS. HELP THEM ON THIS THEM THROUGH THE- SO THOSE ARE JUST OF YOUR- HIGHLIGHTS OF THE WORK WEEK OR IS DOING APRIL HELPED WITH CHILDREN RIGHT NOW. LET ME STOP THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE DEPUTY DIRECT MONICA MORALES. HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME IS MONICA MCALLISTER THE DIRECTOR OVER THE CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND BE PROVIDING SOME BACKGROUND IN ALL CHILDREN THRIVE INITIATIVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS JUST A LITTLE REMINDER ON THE ALL CHILDREN THRIVE CAMPAIGN IS REALLY THE PURPOSE OF IT IS FOR CITIES TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. A PILOT FUNDING OF TEN MILLION OVER THE YEARS WAS INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT WHEN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FIND OUR PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE. HE PAID CONTRACT IT WOULD PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES AND THE UCLA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO LEAD THE PROJECT ALL CHILDREN THRIVE MAINTAINS IN EQUITY WORKGROUP RIGHT NOW IT'S REALLY GUIDING THE FOLLOWING KEY STRATEGIES OF THE INITIATIVE STARTED WITH CREATING PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENTS PROMOTING HEALTHY TELL DEVELOPMENT ACCESS TO SAFE AND STABLE HOUSING STRENGTHENED ECONOMIC COURT YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS. PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES REPORTS THAT THERE ARE TWENTY ONE CITIES PARTICIPATING IN THEIR INITIATIVE I TO DATE SOME OF THE KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS INCLUDE COMPLETION OF A TOOL KIT ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ONLINE COMMUNITY PLATFORM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CITY. BY CITY COACHING CLIENTS. IN ADDITION YOU KNOW THE P. H. HAS REALLY BEEN WORKING WITH THE TEAM TO REALLY DO A LOT OF THE- CONTACT ADMINISTRATION ACTIVITIES. THE SCHOOL COMPONENTS OF THE WAR WE'VE PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PROJECT AROUND YOU KNOW JUST EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES SOME OF THE KEY DATA THE DEPARTMENT ALSO- MANAGES AND WE'VE CONVENE SEVERAL TIMES- STAKEHOLDERS UCLA AND SO FORTH TO DISCUSS HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS ON. THE PROGRESS AND HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KIND OF MOVE SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES FORWARD. I'M IN ADDITION WE REALLY WORK WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE PROPER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THAT THEIR SUBMITTED ON A TIMELY BASIS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY MISSION NUMBER LEGISLATOR. I'M AT THIS POINT THE PROJECT IS SCHEDULED TO END BY THE END OF DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR- AT THAT POINT WE DO EXPECT A FINAL VALUATION REPORT TO BE PROVIDED. THAT WOULD REALLY A DISCUSS SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS OF THIS PILOT PROJECT FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS- ALL OF THAT WILL BE PACKAGED AND WILL BE OUR SHARED WITH THE MADOC OVERSIGHT. AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION THE SENATE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUDGETS AS WELL. I'M YOU KNOW WE DID GET A QUESTION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF COAL BID ON THE WORK- YOU KNOW I THINK LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WE HAVE SEEN THAT WE'VE HAD TO PIVOT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO PICK FROM IN PERSON. INITIATIVE TO REALLY MORE OF AN ONLINE- INSTEAD THAT HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE VERY QUICKLY FOLKS RETOOLED THEY THOUGHT ABOUT WAYS THAT THEY COULD REALLY OPEN UP THE ONLINE PLATFORMS TO PROMOTE ENGAGEMENT. TO REALLY ENSURE THAT THEY WERE WORKING WITH THE KEY CITIES AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATES AND LEADERS TO MOVE THEIR- THEIR EFFORTS FORWARD THAT BEING SAID- YOU KNOW WE STILL DIDN'T SEE ANY IMPACT IN TERMS OF THE KEY. FOLKS AND COMMUNITIES THEY CALL THERE IS THAT WERE RICH. PART OF THE AND THAT MORPHED SOME OF- YOU KNOW REALIZE THAT WE EVERYTHING ON WITH COLD WITH THE TO PAY IT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE DID SEE NEW OP. NEW STATE. THAT REALLY WANT TO AND- SOME OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF- YOU KNOW THE INITIATIVE CAME ON BOARD AND SO WE'VE SEEN KIND OF BASICALLY A TRADE OFF OVERALL. SO WE'LL JUST CONTINUE TO UPDATE YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE AS REFINING OUT NEW INFORMATION AND REALLY KEEP YOU GUYS ABREAST OF SOME OF THE KEY COMPONENTS THAT. HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON AS WELL AS EFFORTS RAMP UP. SO WITH THAT. I'LL PASS IT ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER THANK YOU. TERBIUM EUROPE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THAT PRECEDE THE OPPORTUNITY I'M GOING TO COVER THREE ISSUES OUR SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS. ABOUT HOW PARTNERSHIPS SECOND ARE YOU DROP IN CENTERS AND I WORK ON THE SIDE BECAUSE THIS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE STAFF WORK THAT WENT INTO CAN ALICE'S. I AM I THINK DISTRICTS LOAN PART IN HERE THE COMMISSION A FEW YEARS AGO RECOGNIZE THAT IN SOME WAYS WE HAVE CREATED FISCAL AND OTHER INCENTIVES THAT MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO PARTNER WE HAVE SEEN SOME PARTNERSHIPS HAPPEN NATURALLY THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF JUST SOME INCREDIBLE EDUCATORS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. DIRECTORS BUT GENERALLY THESE PARTNERSHIPS TEND TO BE THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE ROLE SO THE COMMISSION WORKED TO INCENTIVIZE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND COUNTIES AND HOW WE ALLOCATED SOME OF OUR S. B. EIGHTY TWO OR TRIAGE FUNDS. AND THE RESPONSE FROM COUNTIES AND THEIR SCHOOL PARTNERS WAS INCREDIBLE. AND THAT THAT LED TO THAT PASSAGE AND SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE MAIN HOSPITAL SERVICES ACTED WITH SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS. INTO SUPPORTING THESE KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS. THE COMMISSION THAT THIS WORD BECAUSE OF A COUPLE A HANDFUL OF FUNDAMENTAL RATIONALES. FIRST IS THAT CHILDREN ARE IN SCHOOL AND SO SCHOOLS CREATE THESE READY OPPORTUNITIES TO. UNDERSTAND AND MEET THEIR NEEDS SCHOOLS ARE GENERALLY ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND SO THEY BECOME VERY EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAYS THAT WE CAN ENGAGE. IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THEM. AND THE LEVEL OF TRUST THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES OFTEN HAVE IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IT IT'S OFTEN HIGHEST WITH SCHOOLS AND SO THAT HIGH LEVEL OF TRUST THE ACCESS THAT SCHOOLS. CREATE FOR CHILDREN THEN YOU REALLY CREATES A NATURAL OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN THE WAYS IN WHICH WE DELIVER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO YOU AND IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT IN ORDER TO MEET OUR EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH GOALS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CREATE THE RIGHT KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COUNTIES. AS OUTLINED IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS THE COMMISSION ISSUED GRANTS TO FOR COUNTIES THAT HAD PROPOSED TO JOIN WITH THEIR SCHOOLS WE'VE BEEN RECEIVED IN AUSTIN SERVICES ACT FUNDS IT WAS A FORTY MILLION ONE TIME AT TEN MILLION NOT GOING. OVER MULTIPLE YEARS WE TURN THAT INTO A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT OPPORTUNITY WITH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS AND WE WERE ABLE TO FIND EIGHTEEN. COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS. NEED TO BCK RECOGNIZES THAT THERE THERE WAS UNMET NEEDS ADD TO THE LEVEL OF ABOUT EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO FIND TWENTY ADDITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS THAT WERE PROPOSED THE BCP REQUESTS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. ASSUMING THAT THE LANGUAGE WOULD ALLOW US TO FIND THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WERE ALREADY PROPOSED WE SEE THIS AS SHOVEL READY PARTNERSHIPS THE COMMISSION WOULD BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE THESE DOLLARS TO OUR COUNTY PARTNERS PRIOR TO THE START OF SCHOOL IN. OVER THE SUMMER IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT OUR LOCAL PARTIES WOULD BE ABLE TO LAUNCH NEW PROGRAMS BEFORE STUDENTS RETURN BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT WE CAN GET GOING VERY QUICKLY. WITH A LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT'S IN THE IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO FIND TO ADDITIONAL SMALL COUNTIES AT TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS EACH TO ADDITIONAL MEDIUM SIZE COUNTIES A FOUR MILLION DOLLARS EACH AND TWO ADDITIONAL LARGE COUNTIES. AT SIX BILLION DOLLARS EACH. FOR A TOTAL OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. I DO WANT TO RECORD. THAT FULLY FUNDING WOULD TAKE A LITTLE OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. BUT I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN FULLY FUNDED THAT WOULD MEAN TWENTY COUNTIES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. AND EVEN THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING THE SIZE OR SCALE OF THESE GRANTS. FALLS SHORT OF WHAT ACTUALLY IS NEEDED IF WE WANT TO DELIVER CARE OR BUILD OUT STRONGER COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR SCHOOLS. THESE FUNDS HOWEVER ARE A DOWN PAYMENT OR STARTING POINT. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING INCENTIVES JUST TO STRENGTHEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTIES IN OUR SCHOOLS WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT THEIR SUCCESS BY LOOKING AT MODELS FOR GOVERNANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCING FOR THE KINDS OF PROGRAMMING THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE ACROSS SUCH A DIVERSE STATE AND A DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS. AND DIVERSE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WE NEED TO BUILD OUR CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND WHICH OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING AND TO LEARN FROM THE PROGRESS THAT HAPPENS OVER TIME AND WE NEED TO REVISIT SOME OF OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT MAY HINDER OR WE HOPE ACTUALLY SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THIS FROM THE COMMISSION'S PERSPECTIVE THE STATE REALLY NEEDS TO EMBRACE THESE PARTNERSHIPS IN WAYS WHERE WE CAN ALL SHARE RISK AND RECOGNIZE WE SHARE REWARDS WHEN WE GET SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH DOWN RIGHT FIRST FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. MISSPOKE IS ON CAPACITY BUILDING IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE QUITE OFTEN WE HEARD THIS LAST WEEK IN A LISTENING SESSION IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. WELL WE DO FEEL THAT MANY OF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS MAY FOR A LOT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS AND SCHOOLS HVE FIGURED OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND ARE FAR ALONG. MANY OTHERS HAVE YET TO BENEFIT FROM THE GUIDANCE AND EXPERIENCE OF THEIR- SISTER AGENCIES THAT HAVE LEARNED SOME OF THESE LESSONS. THERE'S A FEW OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. ELEVATING HIS VOICE THE COMMISSION WENT THROUGH ABOUT AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PROCESS OF ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE TO TALK WITH THEM ABOUT THEIR MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES. OR MENTAL HEALTH AND THEY HIGHLIGHTED OPPORTUNITIES TO THE SCHOOL. TO THEIR SCHOOLS AND THE IDEAS THEY HAVE ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS OFTEN DIVERGE FROM WHAT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS WE'RE SEEING COMING OUT OF SOME OF THE COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS AND SO ELEVATING YOUTH VOICE IS AN AREA WHERE THE COMMISSION FEELS VERY STRONGLY. MUST BE A COMPONENT OF OUR BROADER EFFORTS TO SUPPORT SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH- WE WANT TO CREATE ON DEMAND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR LOCAL PARTNERS SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET GET THESE PROGRAMS RIGHT. WE WANT TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO LEVERAGE IMAGES STATE INNOVATION FUNDS WERE AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE. AND SEE HOW WE CAN SHARE RISK BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES AND OUR SCHOOLS TO REALLY- DESIGN PROGRAMS THAT WILL NEED TO EVOLVE OVER TIME AS WE LEARN. AND AS WE INTEGRATE THE STRATEGIES. I'M GONNA SHIP DURING DROPPED WORK. HE THE COMMISSION WAS FINE AS OUTLAW. IN THE ANALYSIS TO LAUNCH A SERIES OF YEARS DROPPING MODELS BASED ON A MODEL OUT OF AUSTRALIA CALLED HEADSPACE. AND IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE BUILDING THAT OUT IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTIES. AND COMMUNITY PROVIDERS UNDER THE BRAND ALL CODES. THE MODEL THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE AROUND THE WORLD REALLY BEGINS WITH THE PREMISE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN AND DELIVERY OF SERVICES INCLUDING THE WAY IN WHICH- THE NAME THAT IS USED. IN REFERRING TO THESE SERVICES AND THE WAY IN WHICH WE TALK ABOUT AND COMMUNICATE THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THIS PROJECT STARTED WITH A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INNOVATION PROPOSAL FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY. WE HAVE NOW FIVE. DIGITS HAVE. FOUR ADDITIONAL LOCAL PARTNERS ACT WAS FIVE TO AN LA ONE AND SAN MATTEO ONE IN ORANGE AND ONE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. WE'RE BUILDING A LEARNING COLLABORATIVE WITH SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP FROM EXPERTS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. RIGHT NOW WE ARE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE DAHLE GOALS OF FIDELITY TO THE MODEL. WHILE ALSO REMOVING ANY BARRIERS TO ACCESS SO THAT WE CAN- AT. SCALE THIS MODEL UP NOT JUST ACROSS THE STATE BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING INCREASE FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE INTERESTED. IN ADAPTING THE ALCOVE MODELS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THE BALLOT THE QUESTION HERE IS HOW CAN WE BALANCE SUPPORTING FIDELITY THIS WELL ESTABLISHED MODEL IN THIS CAPACITY TO SCALE OVERTIME. OR WORKING THROUGH LEGAL PROGRAMMATIC FINANCIAL pISSUES- BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH STANFORD. WITH OUR COUNTY AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING THIS MODEL LEFT RATE IN CALIFORNIA. WE REALLY ARE HOWEVER JUST GETTING STARTED BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TASK- IT'S WHAT FOR A MODEL THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED ELSEWHERE AND. AND THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADAPT YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. THE THIRD ISSUE THAT I WANT TO MENTION. AS OUTLINED IN THE NON IS EARLY PSYCHOSIS AND AGAIN WE- THE WRITER. THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE WE'RE REALLY WORKING TO CREATE. JOE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION LANDS. WE TRIED FOR THE PAST. I SHOULD SAY RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE'S ABOUT AN EIGHTEEN MONTH DELAY IN ACCESSING CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING EARLY PSYCHOSIS EPISODE. IN CONTRAST WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM TOM INSULT THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF NIMH TO SEARCH FOR A MOMENT HERE AS THERE ARE MENTAL HEALTH CZAR TO THE GOVERNOR. IS THAT THAT THAT DELAY IN THE UNITED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IS ABOUT TWO WEEKS SO THERE'S AN EIGHTEEN MONTH DELAY IN ACCESSING HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS TWO WEEK DELAY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. SO THE QUESTION THAT THE COMMISSION ACTUALLY TRYING TO TACKLE IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS. TO SPRING SEKULA SAYS IN THE FASTEST TIME POSSIBLE. TO DO THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTY PARTNERS WITH UC DAVIS AS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT WE'RE CONNECTING WITH OTHER STATES THAT ARE WORKING TO BUILD OUT THEIR RELEASE ACOSTA STRATEGIES. AND THE TARGET HERE IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE IN A TIMELY MANNER. IT REDUCES THE OFTEN MOST DIFFICULT MOST EXPENSIVE AND MOST IMPACTFUL. MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES FACING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES OFTEN RELATING TO HOMELESSNESS INCARCERATION I'M MULTIPLE HOSPITALIZATIONS INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION AS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AT STATE HOSPITALS. WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW CAN WE BUILD CAPACITY TO SCALE UP EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES TO THESE EARLY PSYCHOSIS INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY LOWER COSTS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND DO SO IN A WAY THAT WE'RE PARTNERING. WITH NOT JUST WITH MEDIC CAL IN OTHER IN OTHER N OTHER PROVIDERS OR LOOKING AT ALL THESE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES BUT ALSO WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE HAVE A VERY CREATIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH KAISER NOR CAL. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN BEGIN TO UTILIZE THIS TREATMENT MODEL CONCORD AT THE SPECIALTY CARE WHICH IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE UNDER MEDICARE I'LL BUT IT'S TYPICALLY NOT FUNDED UNDER COMMERCIAL INSURANCE WE'RE ALSO TALKING WITH. PURCHASERS OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE INCLUDING PURCHASERS LIKE CALPERS AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE THE PURCHASING POWER OF A LARGE PURCHASER LIKE ARE PENSION FUNDS TO REALLY SHAPE THE COMMERCIAL HEALTH CARE MARKET PLACE. SO THAT WE CAN EXPAND ACCESS. TO CARE FOR THOSE BEHAVIORS. RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO LINK DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS THAT PARTICIPATION IN THESE EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS HAVE ON THE OUTCOMES THAT THAT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR INCLUDING REDUCING CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. INCLUDING REDUCING PARTICIPATION AND FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT LATER ON THE AGENDA- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT DISPARITIES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THESE SYSTEMS. OTHER STATES ARE A BIT FARTHER AHEAD OF US. AT WORK PLACE TO CATCH UP THROUGH THE KIND OF COLLABORATION THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND UC DAVIS UCLA AND UC SAN FRANCISCO AS WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE. AND WE'RE TAKING GUIDANCE FROM SOME OF THE WORK THAT HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER AREAS OF HEALTHCARE WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS EFFORTS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO CREATE GREATER AWARENESS AROUND THE REST OF STROKES FOR EXAMPLE AND HOW INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES SHOULD RESPOND WHEN THEY SUSPECT THAT SOMEONE MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING A STROKE. WE HAVE YET TO BEGIN TO DO THAT KIND OF STIGMA REDUCTION WORK AND ENGAGEMENT AROUND PSYCHOSIS- BUT THE IMPACTS OF IGNORING THE INITIAL. SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOSIS THE IMPACTS OF STATEMENT THAT LEADS TO PEOPLE DELAYING ACCESS TO CARE OUR PROFOUND. FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES BUT ALSO FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEIGHBORING CARE. SO THAT THIS IS A PRODUCT OF ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT AGAIN WE ARE. GETTING NEW PROGRAMMING OFF THE GROUND WE ARE WORKING TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE NEEDS FOR WORKING TO ADDRESS GREATER UNDERSTANDING. OF THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES HAVE WHEN THEY'RE BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE PSYCHOSIS AND HOW WE CAN SUPPORT THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS CARE AND WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD OUT A DATA DRIVEN STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT WERE HAVING. THAT WAS A LOT I APOLOGIZE BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE HAVE DR KELLY. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS. SO WHEN IT COMES TO BE ABLE HEALTH CONDITIONS WE ALL KNOW CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE NOT SIMPLY LITTLE ADULTS SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE. PREVENTION DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT APPROACHES MUST BE AGE APPROPRIATE. AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE EFFECTIVE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE WE KNOW THAT RATES OF CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CONDITIONS. ARE ALSO MUCH HIGHER AMONG CHILDREN AND YOUTH THAN IN ADULTS WITH ONE STUDY FINDING THAT 60% OF USED HER RECEIVING COMMUNITY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. ALSO MET DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR MENTAL ILLNESS FURTHERMORE BECAUSE CHILDREN DON'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME IN PRIMARY CARE. AFTER THE AGE OF THREE OR FOUR WITH THEIR PEDIATRICIANS WHEN IMMUNIZATIONS AND WELL CHILD VISITS TAPER OFF. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO OUR REGION ENGAGE CHILDREN INTO SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE STANDARD HEALTH SYSTEM. WE HAVE BUILT OUT OUR SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIP AS A DOCTOR YOU IN REFER TO. I'M TO MEET CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHERE THEY ARE TODAY ARE SCHOOL BASED PARTNERSHIPS ARE KEY COMMUNITY ACCESS POINTS PROVIDING A BROAD RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES NOT JUST THE CHILDREN BUT ALSO TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. OUR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES SUPPORT HOMELESS AND CHILD WELFARE INVOLVED MEDIC CAL CHILDREN AS WELL AS ALL CHILDREN IN OUR SCHOOLS. CBH DA HAS FOCUSED. ON LEVERAGING OUR HISTORY. I AND OUR KNOW HOW IN- WE DO NOW. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT HAS ALSO ALLOWED US TO FULLY DEVELOP OUR CHILDREN'S SYSTEM OF CARE WE HAVE DATA WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS. AND THAT HAS LED TO FOR MY COUNTY SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY THE PAST DECADE A WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL SOUTH US TO GET THIS RIGHT. A WE HAVE YOU LEVERAGED I MEAN JUST A DOLLARS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS SYSTEMS PROGRAMS AND SCHOOL AGE TREATMENT SERVICES AGAIN FOR ALL CHILDREN IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. LEVERAGING THAT AM I JUST A DOLLAR WE'VE CREATED PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR COUNTY AND CITY SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS LEVERAGING EDUCATIONAL DOLLARS WHICH IS DIFFICULT AS A MATCH. AND THAT EXTENDS OUR REACH INTO ALL CHILDREN NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING MEDIC HOW. A RECENT SURVEY OF OUR MEMBERSHIP THIS LAST MONTH HAD FOUND THAT AMONG THE COUNTY SURVEYED. 97% REPORTING 85% HAVE EXISTING SCHOOL BASED PARTNERSHIPS THE MAJORITY OF COUNTIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY COVER BETWEEN EIGHTY AND 1100% OF THE SCHOOLS. AT CAMPUSES IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS AND A MAJORITY PROVIDE S. U. D. E. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES IN ADDITION TO MENTAL HEALTH ONSITE. ALSO ANOTHER GOOD POINT THAT DIED DIRECTOR EWING MADE WAS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH RIGHT BEFORE CALLED IT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION WORKED WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND THREE OF OUR DIRECTORS. MYSELF FROM SOMEBODY DO YOU KNOW FRESNO AND MONTEREY PRESENTED TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO ENHANCE- OUR REACH. BUT DESPITE THIS GROUNDWORK CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA ARE SUFFERING MORE AND MORE A CUTE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISES SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. WELL OVERALL ADULT RATES OF DEATH BY SUICIDE TYPICALLY DIP A LITTLE BIT. IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS ALL OF THE REPORTING WE'VE SEEN HAS SHOWN THAT RATES ARE UP FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE ACCESSING A CRISIS AND REQUIRING LONGER HOSPITALIZATIONS RATES ARE UP TO FOLD AND IN SOME COUNTIES. THREE FALL THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC COUNTY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE USE OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THERE IS A GRANT FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION AND THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SOLUTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE PROVIDED FOR US TO HAVE WEB BASED TRAINING AND WAYS TO ADAPT CLINICAL PRACTICE. PRACTICE. TO HEALTH TELEHEALTH MODALITIES. FOR OLDER CHILDREN. AS WAS PREVIOUSLY PRIVACY IS HUGE AND ENSURING CONFIDENTIALITY PARTICULARLY ON COM COM CONFLICTS ME INVOLVED FAMILY MEMBERS YOU MIGHT BE LIVING IN THE SAME PLACE. FOR OUR CLIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE TECHNOLOGY. OR INTERNET ACCESS TO ENGAGE IN TELEHEALTH SOME COUNTIES HAVE HAD TO SET UP SECURE DEDICATED SPACE TO PROVIDE. A SAFE PLACE WHERE FAMILIES CAN WORK AND ARE YOU CAN WORK WITH AN OFFSITE CLINICIAN THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT SPEAKING FROM A COUNTY THAT HAS- A LACK OF SATELLITE COVERAGE. TELEHEALTH IS AN ADDENDUM TO IT'S AN ADDITIONAL TOOL IT IS NOT EVER TO BE USED. INSTEAD OF ACTUAL DIRECT CLINICAL CARE AS A CLINICAL DECISION THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE BY THE PROVIDER AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH IF YOU HAVE A CHILD WHO'S HAVING DELUSIONS OR HALLUCINATIONS IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO HAVE THEM. KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REALITY AND DELUSION IF YOU'RE USING A COMPUTER SCREEN. WE ALSO SUPPORTED CHILDREN BY DOING MORE TO SUPPORT CARE GIVERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND SAMBAR DINO COUNTY WE HAVE HAD AN INCREASE DURING PANDEMIC OF 16% PROVIDING SUPPORT SERVICES TO FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE TALKING TO THE CHILD WE CAN SEEN MOM OR DAD OR FOSTER MOM WALKING IN THE BACKGROUND. WE CAN EASILY ACCESS THEM. AT THE SAME TIME. DUE IN PART TO THE SHIP TO DISTANCE LEARNING OUR USUAL MEANS OF IDENTIFYING AND CONNECTING WITH CHILDREN HAS BEEN IMPACTED. A SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS WON'T ALLOW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ON CAMPUS FOR FEAR OF SPREADING THOUGH THE VIRUS. SO FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOL BASED REFERRALS MIGHT BE DOWN IN SOME CASES AS MUCH AS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. BUT COUNTIES RESPONDED TO THIS CHALLENGE IN SEVERAL WAYS WE HAVE REDIRECTED SCHOOL BASED PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE OTHER SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. WITHOUT REACH TO SELFIES TO ENSURE WE ARE PARTING WITH OUR EDUCATION PARTNERS AND- TO IDENTIFY TARGETS STUDENTS WHO MAY BE AT HIGHER RISK. WE ARE INCREASING OUR OUTREACH TO SCHOOL FAMILIES AND PARTNERING WITH SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP CURRICULUM ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH THE SCHOOLS ARE DISSEMINATING AS WELL. AND WE'VE INCREASED MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE SERVICES SOMETHING THAT WE ARE OLD HAND OUT UNFORTUNATELY AS THIS IS AN EMERGENCY PREFERRED SERVICE. I'LL BE AT ONE WITH MINIMAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEDIC CALORIE ENFORCEMENT. KENNY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS BEEN. AT THIS A LONG TIME AND WE ARE EXCITED TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE WITH OUR PARTNERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR KELLY NEXT MICHELLE CABRERA. HI MISTER SHARON MEMBERS I WILL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT NOW TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND WHAT WE THINK- WE SHOULD DO ABOUT THEM- WE WILL BE TALKING LATER ABOUT HOW AIMED MORE AT LENGTH BUT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT- FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA FOR ACCESSING SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT THE ISSUE THAT WOULD FLAG FIRE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND AS OVERDUE FOR REFORM. AND EVEN- PRETEND THAT MAKE IN ORDER TO INCREASE- MEDIC HOW BILLABLE SERVICES- THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING UP CURRENTLY AS YOU MAY KNOW A CHILD WERE YOU MUST HAVE A DIAGNOSIS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE SPECIAL CAN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THIS HAS EXPOSED COUNTY TO SIGNIFICANT STATE AND FEDERAL AUDITORS ALLOWANCES. MADE IT A REAL CHALLENGE FOR COUNTIES TO FUND CERTAIN SERVICES TO CHILDREN UNDER MEDIC HOW SO WITH THE PROPOSED REFORMS UNDER KELLY MARC HOPE IS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE MORE OF THOSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION FONG AND SHOW THE COLDER POLICY MAKERS THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE CURRENTLY ACCESSING TO. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ALSO BE ABLE TO USE THOSE ADDED DOLLARS TO BUILD. OUT THE CERTIFICATE. UNDER CARRY KELLY COUNTY AND ALSO I THE STATE FIFTY. APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR AUTOMATIC CAL. TO SPECIAL MENTAL SERVICES- WHICH ARE CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE FOR ALL FOSTER YOUTH AS WELL AS HOMELESS YOUTH- THIS WOULD HELP US. TO AMELIORATE OR PREVENT MEDICAL CONDITION THANK YOU FOR CONDITIONS ANOTHER AT THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AND THEN WE ARE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TO INITIATE AND FINANCE OUR STATE WIDE NETWORK OF EARLY PSYCHOSIS- AT CLINICAL OFFERING WITH AN HSA FUNDS- WE'VE NOT ONLY GROWN THESE SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE LEARNING COLLABORATIVE HAVE HELPED COUNTY TO COMPARE NOTES. AND BRING EMERGING BEST PRACTICE TO THE FOR- ONE OF THE- INITIATIVE THAT WE'VE REALLY TAKEN UNDERTAKEN WITH RESPECT TO EARLY PSYCHOSIS WORK IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WORK IS ADAPTED TO CALIFORNIA'S. DIVERSE POPULATION WITH MORE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY ALIGNED SERVICES- WE BELIEVE THAT HE ROAD AHEAD WILL NOT BE EASY BUT CHILDREN AND OUR SYSTEMS ARE RESILIENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS RIGHT TO FOCUS ON BUILDING OUT SCHOOL BASED PARTNERSHIP AT THEY ARE CRUCIAL AFTER THAT POINT- BUT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE UPON THAT WORK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE EFFORTS ARE SCALED UP TO INCLUDE NOT JUST MEDIC HOW- BUT ALSO REGIONAL CENTERS. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE TO ENSURE THAT ALL INSURERS ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO MAKE SURE THEY BEACH CHILDREN FAMILIES BEFORE THEY- FALL INTO CRISIS- BECAUSE SCHOOLS HAVE EXPRESSED THE DESIRE FOR OUR SCHOOL BASED PARTNERSHIPS THAT SERVE ALL CHILDREN. REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE HI AT B. H. IN BOXING LEGISLATION THIS YEAR EIGHTY FIVE BY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK SILVA TO BETTER ENGAGE PRIVATE PLAN IN THE DELIVERY AND FINANCING OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS. FOR THE FIFTY PER CALIFORNIA'S WHO ARE CO BY THE HEALTH WE HOW TO REMEMBER THAT COUNTY HEALTH PLANS OFFER A MUCH FOR. BRING OF BASED SERVICE. NOT JUST UNDER MY BUT OF NON HOW MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT SERVICES AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER BLOCK GRANT FUNDED SERVICES. FINALLY WE BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD ENSURE THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE INFORMING MEDIC HELP AND APPRECIATE THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF MILD TO MODERATE BENEFITS FOR CHILDREN AND INCENTIVIZING THEIR PROVIDERS TO CONDUCT HE HE HE WILL HELP BRING HER CHILDREN. AS SCREENING AND REFERRALS ARE FOR MANAGED CARE RESPONSIBILITY UNDER EPS EIGHTEEN AND IMPROVED ACCESS TO THE MILD TO MODERATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WILL HELP MITIGATE THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING. WE CANNOT ATTEMPT TO EXPAND ALL OF THESE SERVICES TO THE DEGREE THAT WE ARE PROPOSING WITHOUT AS A SERIOUS LOOK AT THE WORK FORCE- I. TO SERVE CHILDREN AND YOU WE NEED MORE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS MORE TRAINING IN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. AND CALIFORNIA NEEDS MORE ACCESS TO HIGH ACUITY SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN THE STATE. IF THE PANDEMIC TRENDS CONTINUE AT THIS INVESTMENT AS WELL AS POLICY CHANGES MAY BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. AS CLOSE TO HOME AS POSSBLE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO COMMENT ON THE ISSUE. THANK NEXT WE HAVE J. HAM WHAT AT. FOR THE- ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ARAMBULA NOW MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS JEFF HAMPTON THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION PLANS.

AM ONLY RAMPED UP THE LEOPARDS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CALL THE NINETEENTH ENDEMIC. I'M GOING TO TAKE A VARIETY OF ACTIONS TO AVOID AND ELIMINATE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL INTERRUPTIONS IN SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I PARTICULARLY FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND MOVE QUICKLY I MEAN EXCUSE ME AND MOVE QUICKLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC TO EXPAND. HEALTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH ACCESS FOR YOU. ALSO INTERNET FOR TO INCREASE BEHAVIOR HOW ACT ANY. HIGH SCHOOL IF YOU. MANY PLAN TO PARTNER THE SCHOOL BASED CLINICAL PROGRAMMING TO BRING ADDITIONAL SERVICES IN SCHOOLS. CREATING NEW PROGRAMS TO EXPAND ONLINE ACCESS TO. TAILORED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. OFTENTIMES UTILIZING EXISTING DIGITAL PLATFORMS HERE TO THIS GENERATION OF THE- I SPECIFICALLY WE'VE HEARD FROM ONE MAN WHO ISSEEKING TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO DATA HEALTH SERVICES FOR YOUTH. VESTED IN HERE HOT START UP THAT PROVIDES VIRTUAL BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. IT PROVIDES RENTAL EDUCATION IN AN ENCOURAGING. THIS HEALTH PLAN WILL BE PILOTING THE PROGRAM. ALWAYS TO MEASURE THE EFFICACY OUTCOMES MAJOR HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDING IN THIS EXAMPLE THE PRODUCT WILL BE OFFERED TO MEMBERS AND MARKET. I JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS BEEN DOING SINCE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES THE PANDEMIC- YOU DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HAPPENED RIGHT IN STATES INCREASE THE SERVICES ARE INCLUDED CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS. SPECIFICALLY HEALTH PLANS HAVE EXPANDED ONLINE ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING PROVIDING FREE DIGITAL RESOURCES MENTAL HEALTH APPS PHONE AND VIDEO ALL THERAPY SESSIONS.

I MEAN CAN ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN CONTINUING SUPPORT PARTNERSHIP A SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES ARE CONNECTED TO A ROBUST REFERRAL NETWORK AMONG OTHER THINGS. AGAIN I'M THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THIS AFTERNOON AND HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. NEXT WE OF COURSE HOW SHE DEALT WITH THE- ANALYST'S OFFICE. JERRY COREY HAS SHE DONE WITH THE L. A. L. I'LL JUST BE GIVING SOME BRIEF COMMENTS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THE DH CS INCENTIVE PROGRAM PROPOSAL AND- JUST WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT WE RECENTLY PUBLISHED AN ANALYSIS OF THIS PROPOSAL ON OUR ON OUR WEBSITE. FIRST WE JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANTIAL DETAILS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL THAT REMAIN UNDER DEVELOPMENT- THESE WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY THAT WOULD DETERMINE HOW INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO MANAGED CARE PLANS- IT'S ALSO OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT FOR THIS PROPOSAL. ON THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO RELY ON BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE RATHER THAN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- TO ESTABLISH THE GRANT THE- THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS GIVEN THAT BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TYPICALLY LACKS SPECIFICITY AND DETAIL WHEN COMPARED TO- TRAILER BILL AND WE FIND THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN PROVIDING- YOUR INPUT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETAILS OF THIS PROPOSAL MAYBE SIGNIFICANTLY CONSTRAINED UNDER BUDGET BILL. AND SO WE'RE RECOMMEND OR WORDS SUGGESTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE OWN ADOPT THE- TRAILER BILL APPROACH TO THIS TO THIS PROPOSAL- NEXT WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL WHILE WE DON'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH THE CONCEPT OF INCREASING MANAGED CARE. PLANS FOOTPRINT IN SCHOOLS- YOU KNOW AS THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE ALREADY SORT OF TASKED WITH PROVIDING A SET OF. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN- WE DO FIND WHETHER IT'S UNCLEAR WE DO FIND THAT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE AMOUNT PROVIDED AN INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WILL ACTUALLY INDUCE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO INVEST IN THESE PARTNERSHIPS- IN THE LEGISLATURE MAY ONE ASK THE ADMINISTRATION HOW IT DETERMINED THAT. THIS FUNDING ABOUT WOULD SORT OF BE SUFFICIENT TO ALTER PLAN BEHAVIOR AND TO SET UP THESE THESE PARTNERSHIPS. IN ADDITION WE FIND THAT YOU KNOW A REAL CHALLENGE WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS GOING TO BE NAVIGATING SORT OF THE VERY FRAGMENTED BEHAVIOR HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM ESPECIALLY AS IT AS IT RELATES TO CHILDREN-AS DISCUSSED EARLIER YOU KNOW STUDENTS CAN ACCESS. MANY CAL BEHAVIORAL SERVICES THROUGH SEVERAL DIFFERENT ENTITIES- BE IT COUNTY IS MANAGED CARE PLANS OUR SCHOOLS DIRECTLY- AND WHICH ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT- THROUGH MEDICARE CAN OFTEN SORT OF BE. DETERMINED INCONSISTENT. IN ADDITION AS SORT OF THE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES NOTED ON THIS CALL ON THIS- MEETING EARLIER THAT- YOU KNOW COUNTY'S MAIL ALREADY SORT OF PROVIDE THE SAME. SERVICES IN SCHOOLS THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS COULD PROVIDE BUT- THEY THEY MIGHT JUST SORT OF USE THEIR LOCAL COUNTY FINDS INSTEAD OF PROVIDING THE SERVICES THROUGH THE MEDIC HOW- ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY THAT THIS PROPOSAL REALLY SORT OF HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO CLARIFY EXACTLY WHAT SERVICED. SERVICE GAPS EXIST CURRENTLY THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE SORT OF UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO FILL. AND FOR A REALLY CALM. STATE EFFORT- EVEN THINKING MORE GENERALLY OUTSIDE OF THIS PROPOSAL TO COORDINATE ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES TO ENSURE THAT. A ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT STUDENTS ARE ENTITLED THROUGH THROUGH MEDICARE HOW ARE BEING PROVIDED IN. THE THAT SORT OF NO DUPLICATED SERVICES ARE ARE BEING PROVIDED- JUST FINALLY JUST WANT TO SORT OF ADD THAT ON WHILE WE DON'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH THE- THE OASES OF MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES ACT PROPOSAL THERE IS GANG RELATED PROPOSAL IN THE EDUCATION SPACE- TO PROVIDE- SORT OF LIKE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MATCHING FUNDS FOR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH ACTIVITIES. ON WHERE WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL AND- YOU KNOW THE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THAT. CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL- SO THAT THAT SORT OF BOOKLETS ARE ARE REMARKS FOR THIS THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DíAS FOR QUESTIONS I WILL BEGIN- AND IF I CAN'T I DO WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I HEARD- WE HEARD FROM DIRECTOR. LIGHT BORN THAT ALL CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS AND WITHOUT DELAY. WE HEARD FROM- TOBY HEWING. ABOUT HOW SCHOOLS ARE. READY TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET CHILDREN'S NEEDS. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HELPING TO ELEVATE THE USE VOICE ABOUT SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. WE HEARD FROM DR KELLY THAT CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING MORE AND MORE DURING THE SPENDING. PLAN SO IT'S WITH THAT IN MIND THAT I WANT TO ASK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT URGENCY. TO THE ADMINISTRATION IF I CAN. THERE'S A BIG PUS BY THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP US TO REOPEN SCHOOLS. AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IF THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING FASTER ACTION ON A PACKAGE OF SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORTS. RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL JUNE. SO I'LL START AND OTHERS CAN DEFINITELY- JUMP IN I THINK THAT- IT'S CLEAR TO US AS YOU CAN SEE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN. MORE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED DURING TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN TWENTY NINETEEN. IT AND THE REASON WHY THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT IS THAT BUT ALL OTHER UTILIZATION. IN MEDIC CAL AND THAT'S ALL I CAN SPEAK FOR- INCLUDING INPATIENT EMERGENCY ROOM AND REGULAR OUT PATIENT CARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AND UTILIZATION IN TWENTY TWENTY COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THE ONLY OUT LIAR- IS CONSISTENTLY- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES UNDERSCORING THE NEED- SO I THINK YOU KNOW I TAKE YOUR POINT A VERY. NEARLY AND IT'S SOMETHING WE DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT I THINK IT'S WHY YOU SEE THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU THAT THERE IS A GROWING CONSENSUS THAT WE NEED TO EVEN WITH A LOT OF THE GREAT- INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ACTION AND- THE EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE'VE HAD ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES CLEARLY SEES WE NEED TO DO MORE AND WE NEED TO THINK MORE UPSTREAM AND PREVENTIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES- AND SO- WELL I CAN'T- RESPOND TO HER DIRECT REQUEST IN REGARDS TO AN ADMINISTRATION SO CLOSE I THINK. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN REGARDS TO HOW WE ENSURE CHILDREN ARE GETTING INCREASED ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL SERVICES HARPER COURT MEETING ACROSS SO MANY DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN FUNDING STREAM- AND. WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE AND- I'D LIKE TO NOW TALK ABOUT THE FRAGMENTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND- I THOUGHT THE L. A. O. FRAMED IT QUITE WELL. WHEN THEY ASKED IF YOU COULD CLEARLY ARTICULATE. WHAT SPECIFIC SERVICES MANAGED CARE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR STUDENTS. THAT CANNOT CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY SCHOOLS DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT. SHARKS WE'LL START WITH- THE SCHOOLS SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON THE L. A. BACH PROGRAM WHO PROVIDES- SOME BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH L. A. BACH YOU ONLY HAVE AROUND A 58% OF OUR LEDS PERSISTENT PAIN IN THE L. A. BACH PROGRAM ROBERT IS A HIGHER PROPORTION OF CHILDREN- SERVICE HOWEVER WHEN YOU ARE RECEIVING SERVICES THROUGH THE L. A. BOB PROGRAM I'M IT IS ONLY FOR A SELECT. LIST OF SERVICES APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- IN THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS RESTRICTIONS AROUND WHO CAN RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE I'M ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE. THAT IN THEIR CARE PLAN OR I H. P. R. I. D. SORRY BOUT THAT- INCLUDES A LIMITED NUMBER OF CHILDREN- WHERE THAT IS BEING SERVED- AND THEN OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PARTNERS WELL THEY HAVE- PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SERVICES IN THIS SPACE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SCHOOLS- IT'S DOMINI BEEN FOCUSED ON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES WHICH IS VERY CRITICAL SERVICES- WE DO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED SUCH A NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH AN HSA FUNDS. HOWEVER WE ARE PAYING OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PROVIDE THE NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR ALL CHILDREN- AND WE DO THINK THAT OF THAT IS THAT GAP WE ARE TRYING TO CLOSE THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN. ARE NOT GOING TO NEED A SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT YOU DO NEED AND SO WE'RE VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP THE COUNTIES HAVE PLAYED. IT WITH THE SCHOOLS IN THAT SPACE- HOWEVER WE ARE TRYING TO IN BED IN. THE MORE PREVENTATIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES THAT ARE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A FOR CHILDREN- AND SO WE DO FEEL LIKE. DOING THAT THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS WHERE THERE'S BEEN. SUCCESS WITH PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES NOT ALL SERVICES CAN YOU KNOW EASILY BE PROVIDED ON A SCHOOL BASED SETTING- BUT WE DO FEEL LIKE THERE IS A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WITH OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS I WOULD NOTICE- THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF. YEARS GIVEN TO THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS AS TO WHY THIS HAS BEEN CHALLENGING IN THE FUTURE- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH OUR- COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF. EDUCATION AND OUR ACCOUNT- NURSE WHO HAVE FOR INTO. A THIS TO LEARN FROM THEM LET THAT. INTO BUT PROVIDE INTO. ACROSS THAT WHEN YOU WERE RECEIVING SERVICES AT THE SCHOOL WHETHER IT'S TO LA POP THE COUNTY OR THE MEDICARE PLANS IT'S INTEGRATED- AND HOPEFULLY THAT'S THE SYSTEM WE CAN GET YOU IN THE FUTURE AND THAT'S WHY WE FOCUSED THE DOLLARS ON INCENTIVES. TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY TO BUILD THAT PARTNERSHIP INTO A FUND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAY BE NEEDED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE SPACE. FOR THE FIRST STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID REGARDING THE FRAGMENTED. SYSTEM I'D LIKE TO URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENGAGE AND REAL COORDINATION ACROSS STATE GOVERNMNT. INCLUDING THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY- DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- M. H. O. E. C. AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL AND OTHERS AS YOU SEE APPROPRIATE TO REALLY COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AYE I THINK OUR STUDENTS DESERVE THAT AND REALLY WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT- SO THAT. THE NEXT TIME WE SPEAK WE CAN TALK ABOUT A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM THAT AS MEETING OUR STUDENTS NEEDS. I WOULD LIKE TO NOW MOVE ON IF I CAN'T- JEFF HAMPTON- REGARDING MANAGED CARE PLANS AND WE SEE THAT BOTH MEDICAL AND COMMERCIAL OUR- REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICES THROUGH DTE AND THE L. A- APPROPRIATELY COMMENTS THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS PARTICIPATION THUS FAR AND I WANTED TO SEE IF MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE WILLING AND EAGER TO BRING RESOURCES TO AND TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO OUR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES AND MORE AND GENERALLY TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OUR YOUTH. THANK YOU FOR A REASON QUESTION YEAH ABSOLUTELY I THINK I'M YOU KNOW I IN REGARDS TO THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL I YOU KNOW WE ARE WE ARE- EVEN. WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH BERMAN HEALTHCARE SERVICE AND OTHERS TO. MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFICS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL BUT A YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF BUILDING UPON I INCREASING ACCESS TO SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. FOR YOU I YOU KNOW I WOULD. ABSOLUTELY BE WILLING TO- YOU KNOW ENGAGEMENT PARTNER WITH YOU KNOW ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. IN THAT PROCESS- YEAH I KNOW WE HAVE MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT YOU WE HAVE STARTED BUILDING THE GROUNDWORK. FOR SOME OF THAT WORK THAT THAT'S BEING DONE NOW- AND CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING ADAM YOU KNOW HOW THAT THE BALLOT OUT- YOU KNOW IN THE SPACE BUT THAT BOTH MEDICARE AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS UP. I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DOCTOR ANYWAY IS YES I THINK WE ARE ABSOLUTELY HE GAVE ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS- AND SEEING HOW WE CAN INCREASE ACCESS AND SERVICES- YOU KNOW I AT. SCHOOL THEY STAND IN THE COMMUNITY. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMP. I HIGHLIGHTED THE USE YOU- YOU OFTEN USE EXISTING DIGITAL PLATFORMS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CURRENTLY HAS BEEN PAID FOR BY MEDICARE ALL AND IT BENEFITS ALL STUDENTS AND REALLY WOULD. WANT TO FRUITFUL CONVERSATIONAND I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP BUT WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL TWO ONE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON THE PANEL THREE ON SUICIDE AND OVERDOSE PREVENTION. AGAIN WE WILL NOW HAVE SIX PRESENTERS AND WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL WE HAVE CONCLUDED WE WILL BEGIN WITH DR EWING PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA AGAIN TOOK DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH COMMISSION YOU KNOW I JUST I WANNA AND- JUST QUICKLY REVIEW THAT THE BACKGROUND. ON THE DRAFTING OF STRIVING FOR ZERO THAT THIS IS A PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DEVELOPED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU RECALL SEVERAL YEARS OF CONVERSATION. OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE STATE'S SUICIDE PREVENTION RESPONSE M. AND AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF CONVERSATION THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED THE COMMISSION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. TO DEVELOP A SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE COMMISSION- WE UNDERTOOK A LENGTHY PROCESS OF ENGAGING WITH COUNTY PARTNERS TALKING TO PARTNER STATE AGENCIES SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO ACROSS THE COUNTRY LOOKING AT MODEL PROGRAMS IN IN INDIA AND IN THE VERY END OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE COMMISSION ADOPTED STRIVING FOR ZERO CALIFORNIA'S DID YOU PLAN FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION. THIS THIS PLAN WAS VERY INTENTIONAL AND DESIGN THAT IT STARTS OFF WITH CLEAR ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON WHAT TO DO. IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE WE WANTED TO MAKE IT VERY ACCESSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEEDED ACCESS TO A CRISIS LINE OR A HOTLINE. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT DHS IS TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TO THEIR STUDENTS THERE HAVE CAL HOPE PROJECT HAS REALLY BEEN WORKING TO STRENGTHEN ACCESS TO. ON BASED CARE TO TEXT BASED AND DIGITAL PLATFORMS TO RESPOND TO PEOPLE WHO MAY BE IN CRISIS. SO THE QUESTION REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT-INFORMATION IS ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT WHEN THEY NEED IT. THE REPORT REALLY THEN LOOKS AT IT PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON HOW TO THINK ABOUT SUICIDE PREVENTION TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR ABOUT RISK ASSESSMENT AROUND TRANS. AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THOSE PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE OF BEING EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING SUICIDE. BASED ON THAT INFORMATION THIS PLAN REALLY LAYS OUT A- AN OPERATIONAL APPROACH ENHANCES MEMBER RAMOS COMMENTED EARLIER IN THIS HEARING. THAT THEY'RE STATES VERY AGGRESSIVE PUSH TO RE ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO SITE IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT TOUCHES UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS AROUND ACCESSING THE FULL MEANS AROUND RESPOND TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CRISIS THERE THERE'S THE NEED TO EDUCATE AND ENGAGE SENT TO. EXPLORE HOW WE BEST DO SUICIDE RISK ASSESSMENTS THE FOLLOW UP THAT WE DO AFTER THOSE RISK ASSESSMENTS WE NEED TO TRACK THAT KIND OF RISK ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE BEING DONE WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE DATA STRATEGY. I JUST I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT COKE HAS REALLY REVEALED HOW QUICKLY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE CAN GIVE CAN CREATE ACCESS TO REAL TIME INFORMATION I'M JUST SO IMPRESSED THAT EVERY NIGHT WE CAN SEE DATA ON HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE RECEIVED THE VACCINE. THOSE DATA ARE AVAILABLE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS UNFORTUNATELY OUR SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS OUR DATA ARE IN NO WAY AS ACCEPTABLE AND AS TIMELY AS THAT INFORMATION. THE CAPTION IS ROCK THE CREATION OF THIS OFFICERS PREVENTION AS OUTLINED IN THIS REPORT TO REALLY DO PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP. TO ADDRESS EACH OF THOSE ISSUES AROUND TRAINING AWARENESS DATA UNDERSTANDING AND TO PROMOTE THE RIGHT KINDS OF PROGRAMMATIC AND STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTIES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SCHOOLS. ARE AT PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS WE NEED THIS HIGH LEVEL CONVERSATION ABOUT SUICIDE SO THAT WE CAN THE STATEMENT TIES MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS CARE. IN THE COMMISSION'S WORK IN TALKING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SUICIDE SURVIVORS. THEY OFTEN SPEAK VERY ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTING WITH SOMEONE WHO HELPED THEM GET THROUGH EIGHT A MOMENT OF STRESS A MOMENT OF CRISIS- THAT OFTEN THEY HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME. BUT THEIR ABILITY TO CONNECT IS ACTUALLY WHAT OFTEN HELPS THEM MOVE PAST THAT MOMENT OF CRISIS AND MOVE TOWARDS RECOVERY AND LONG TERM HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS IN TERMS OF THEIR PRICES. IN ADDITION TO CREATING THIS OFTEN SUICIDE PREVENTION YES PLAN REALLY CALLS FOR BUILDING OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT SUICIDE PREVENTION THAT IS ABOUT IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES. AND DOING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING TO PROMOTE THEIR ADOPTION ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE A VERY DISTRIBUTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN THIS STATE. AND SUICIDE PREVENTION ISN'T JUST THE PURVIEW OF ONE ENTITY IT REALLY MEANS ENGAGING MULTIPLE PARTNERS ACROSS THE PUBLIC SECTOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES. WE REALLY NEED TO BUILD OUT TRUSTED CHANNELS THAT PEOPLE CAN TALK WITH OR CAN TALK TO OR CAN ACCESS IN TERMS OF INFORMATION ON SUICIDE THERE'S THIS PERSISTENT NOTION THAT TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT SUICIDE WILL INCREASE THE RISK OF SUICIDE WHEN IN FACT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE. WE ALSO NEED TO REALLY BUT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE RISK BY PROMOTING SAFE ENVIRONMENTS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT REDUCING ACCESS TO LETHAL MEANS AND SO THE LEGISLATURE HAS FOR EXAMPLE. FUNDED A BARRIER ON THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE TO REDUCE SUICIDE RESTS THERE. IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE- CAN USE IT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AND THERE ARE SOME VERY EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTIES IN OTHER STATES. THAT ARE WORKING WITH GUN CLUBS GUNS SHOPS AND GUN OWNERS TO CREATE POWERFUL MESSAGES TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE GUN OWNERS. TO KEEP THEIR GUNS SAFELY LOCKED AWAY OR TO TRANSPORT LEGALLY TRANSFER THEIR GUNS TO A TRUSTED NEIGHBORS OR FAMILY MEMBERS DURING PERIODS OF CRISIS THAT WE CAN REDUCE ACCESS TO VEHICLE MEANS. WE ALSO HAVE TO. IMPROVE THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF RISKS AND IMPROVE THE CONNECTION TO SERVICES ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE KINDS OF SUICIDE SCREENING THAT'S HAPPENING AND HOW WE CAN CREATE A MORE STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO SUICIDE SCREENS AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE SCREENS AND WHAT THEY TELL US. ABOUT RISKS ACROSS THE STATE. INCLUDING SCREENS THAT HAPPENING THROUGH SCHOOLS AND I MENTION THAT BECAUSE THE CONVERSATION I JUST HAD AROUND AS WELL HOW. AND LASTLY I WOULD SAY. WE ALSO NEED TO IMPROVE OUR SUICIDE RELATED SERVICES AND SUPPORT EXACTLY WHAT WE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS POST PENSION. RIGHT OFF AND WE HEAR FROM FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD SOME SUICIDE RELATED INCIDENT AND THERE ARE ACCESSING CRISIS SERVICES- BUT UPON RELEASE FROM HOSPITAL OR AFTER AN ASSESSMENT THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY THE POST PENSION FOLLOW UP THAT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THESE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. BECAUSE THE RISK THAT MIGHT HAVE LED TO THE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS OFTEN DOESN'T GO AWAY. SO TOOK THIS REPORT IS REALLY DESIGNED TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF STRATEGIES THAT CAN STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO SUICIDE AND N. AS STATED IN THE TITLE STRIVE TO GET TO ZERO IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF SUICIDE DEATHS WE HAVE IN THE STATE. IN THE AGENDA- YOUR STAFF ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN AT THE MOMENT AND SO IS MENTIONED THERE THE COMMISSION HAD SET ASIDE. TWO MILLION DOLLARS JUST OF OUR OPERATING FUNDS WE SHIFTED AROUND SOME FUNDS INTERNALLY IN ESSENCE WE-DELAYED SOME PAYMENTS FROM ONE FISCAL YEAR TO THE NEXT. RECOGNIZING THAT BECAUSE OF COBEN SUICIDE RISK WOULD BE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AND WE WANTED TO ADVANCE THE WORK IN THIS PLAN AS QUICKLY AND AGGRESSIVELY AS WE CAN. WE ARE WORKING WITH THESE BONDS TO STRENGTHEN LOCAL PLANNING WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH COUNTIES TO BUILD OUT A LEARNING COLLABORATIVE SO THAT COUNTIES CAN LEARN FROM AND WITH EACH OTHER. WE RECOGNIZE THAT QUITE OFTEN THE EXPERTISE IS IN OUR COUNTIES AND THEY'RE ASKING FOR THE SUPPORT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. WE ARE INVESTING A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ADDRESS ISSUES AROUND REDUCING ACCESS TO LETHAL MEANS WITH A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON GUNS- AND AGAIN THAT IS ABOUT ENGAGING PEOPLE. AROUND STATE OWNERSHIP OF GUNS AND CREATING SAFE PROTOCOLS AND PRACTICES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH GUN OWNERS SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK OF SUICIDE HAVE A WAY. TO SAFELY I'M BASS SET ASIDE OR LOCK UP THEIR FIREARMS. WE SOME OF THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO INCREASE TRAINING BOTH IN TERMS OF. RECOGNIZING SIGNS OF SUICIDE HOW TO ENGAGE HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING OF SUICIDE AND HOW TO DO FORMAL RISK ASSESSMENTS. AND THE LAST PIECE THAT WE'RE THAT WE HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN STARTED WITH IS REALLY BUILDING OUT A RESEARCH AGENDA FOR SUICIDE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. THERE MANY AREAS IN HEALTHCARE THAT WE HAVE DONE JUST A PHENOMENAL JOB. OF MAKING AVAILABLE DATA IT IS USEFUL FOR DECISION MAKING- WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN OUR UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE. FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION. THE LAST OF QUESTIONS. IN IN THE AGENDA REALLY GET OUT WHAT ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR US VERY QUICKLY. TO ADD TO RESPOND AND I WILL SAY BASED ON YOUR LAST QUESTION ABOUT CAN WE MOVE FASTER ON SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. FOR THE COMMISSION SUICIDE PREVENTION IS PART OF OUR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH STRATEGY AND WE WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. MOVE VERY QUICKLY TO DISTRIBUTE. NEWLY AVAILABLE AND HSS A FUNDS TO OUR SCHOOL AND COUNTY PARTNERS WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN- MY STAFF SAYS THAT. WE COULD PROBABLY DO THAT IT'S AN S. SIXTY TO NINETY DAY TIME FRAME. IF COUNTIES CAN RESPOND THAT QUICKLY WHICH THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THE STRESS THAT THEY ARE UNDER BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT IN TERMS OF- OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN OUR SAYS THAT PREVENTION WORK AND I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON RETURN TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH ATTENTION AND AWARENESS OF RISKS ACCRUING TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR STUDENTS TO RETURN THAT IF THEY ARE HEALTHY THEY WILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE HEALTHY. AND SO TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS AND WHAT WE MIGHT CALL FRONTLINE WORKERS BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY MUCH ON THE FRONT LINE IN TERMS OF OUR SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR YOU WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE NEEDS OF OUR SCHOOL STAFF WE ALSO HAVE TO BUILD OUT AWARENESS AMONG SCHOOL STAFF OF WHAT SUICIDE PREVENTION MEANS AND HOW TO ENGAGE THE KINDS OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE HOW TO DO REFERRALS AND HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THERE ARE. NUMEROUS PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE THAT ARE. IN THAT ARE IN POSITION TODAY- POCKETS OF EXCELLENCE THAT CAN SUPPORT THE SCREENING THAT IS NEEDED FOR STANDS AROUND SUICIDE PREVENTION. THAT CAN TRIAGE THOSE NEEDS WITH THE RIGHT KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS QUITE OFTEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SCHOOLS ARE ON SCHOOL SITE- BUT AS WAS MENTIONED BY DIRECTOR KELLY IN DECEMBER TO DINO. A STRONG PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN SOME PLACES THAT CAN VERY EFFECTIVELY STRENGTHEN OUR SUICIDE RESPONSE. WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN OUR CRISIS NETWORKS AND I MENTIONED THIS EARLIER AND IT WAS MENTIONED THAT HELLO HOPE IS REALLY CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE TO LEVERAGE DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND TECH TEXT BASED STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NEED TO ACCESS INFORMATION OR CARE- BUT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO. GET THE PHYSICALLY DOWN TO EIGHT A. M. I MENTAL HEALTH. PROVIDER AND SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THAT IN TERMS OF CRISIS SERVICES BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE KINDS OF STRATEGIES AS A WAY TO REDUCE THE DEMAND ON CRISIS SERVICES HOW CAN WE CREATE BETTER UNDERSTANDING ACCESS TO INFORMATION. TO MITIGATE THE NEED TO TURN TO THOSE WHETHER IT'S AN ER OR OR OTHER KIND OF A CRISIS SERVICES. WE ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE- OPPORTUNITIES TO DO MOBILE CRISIS BETTER THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES HAS A THERAPEUTIC TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THAT'S GETTING VERY GOOD REVIEWS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS INNOVATION AND THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT BRING CRISIS STAFF TO THE HOMES OR WORKPLACES OR LOCATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NEED. AND WORK HOW MIGHT THOSE KINDS OF STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN OUR SUICIDE PREVENTION OPPORTUNITIES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE. IN IN IN IN TERMS OF. MY LAST COMMENT IS REALLY IN THE FALL OF THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO STRENGTHEN. THE WAYS IN WHICH WE LEVERAGE OUR SCHOOLS. AND I AND I JUST IN LIGHT OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT MANAGED CARE AND COUNTIES WE RECOGNIZE THAT. MANAGED CARE PLANS OFTEN DO RESPOND TO MILD AND MODERATE BUT COUNTIES ALSO I DON'T KNOW HOW SERVICES ACTED THE PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION COMPONENT. ALSO HAVE A MANDATE. TO PROVIDE PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN BUILD OUT THAT PARTNERSHIP. AND THAT PARTNERSHIP AND SCHOOLS CAN BE HERO HEALTH INCLUDE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THAT PARTNERSHIP ALSO NEEDS TO BE ENGAGED AROUND SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON ON THE PLAN OR HOW SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD SET ASIDE. IS BEING DEPLOYED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE HAVE MONICA MORALES DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU EVERYONE I'LL BE DISCUSSING A LITTLE BIT OF- THE DATA THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT SUICIDE AS WELL AS- AN OVERVIEW OF THE CDC. A SUICIDE PREVENTION GRANT THAT ARE AT THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED SO- WITH THE DATA- IN TERMS OF THE MOST CURRENT STATED ON SUICIDE. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY NINETY IN BIOSTATISTICS DATA. FIRST FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET SUICIDE DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THE RATE OF SUICIDE DEATHS IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES HIGHER AMONG MEN. THAN WOMEN. RATES OF SUICIDE ARE HIGHEST AMONG WHITES FOLLOWED BY AFRICAN. EXCUSE ME FOR ALL THE BY AMERICAN. INDIAN ALASKAN POPULATIONS. THE HIGHEST RATE OCCUR AMONG. OLDEST RESIDENTS EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND OLDER. OUR ARMS ARE USED IN MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF SUICIDES OUR ARMS FOR HOUSTON 41% AMOUNTS TO A SITE FOR EXAMPLE IN 35% OF MY ALSO SITES WERE USED IN- SO SIDE REDUCED HANGING SUFFOCATION. AMONG FEMALE DESCENDANTS HANGING SUFFOCATION AND POISONING OR THE MOST COMMON. WELL 70% OF FEMALE SISTER SITES HOUSTON FIRE ARMS. ADDITIONALLY THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM SHOW THAT NEARLY ONE IN TWO SUICIDE DISSIDENTS HAD A CURRENT DIAGNOSED MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. IN MORE THAN ONE IN FOUR HAD AN ALCOHOL OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM. ONE IN FOUR HAD CURRENTLY OR IN THE PAST UNDERGONE MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. 22% HAD A HISTORY OF ATTEMPTING SUICIDE PRIOR TO THE FATAL INCIDENTS. AND 20% HAD DIAGNOSED THEIR THOUGHTS OR PLANS TO DIE BY SWORD I SUICIDE WITHIN A MONTH PRIOR TO THEIR DEATH. 18% WERE KNOWN TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT OR FORMER INTIMATE PARTNER. SEVENTEEN HAD A PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. SIXTEEN OF DISSIDENTS HAD SERVED IN THE US ARMED FORCES. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REPORTS NATIONALLY FROM THE SENATE FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND INCREASED IN AN INCREASES IN ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS HAS MENTIONED ALSO FIRE THEIR SPEAKERS AS SUCH YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS. AND THE IMPACT OF THE CALL WITH PANDEMIC ON SUICIDE RATES IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER WE DO NOT HAVE THE DATA THAT DEFINITIVELY SHOWS AN INCREASE IN SUICIDES DURING THE PANDEMIC AT THIS POINT. IN TERMS OF THE OVERDOSE STADIUM. CALIFORNIA'S OPIOID OVERDOSE SURVEILLANCE DASHBOARD CURRENTLY HAS DATA AVAILABLE JUNE TWENTY TWENTY CDPH HAS ANALYZED TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY FATAL DRUG RELATED OVERDOSE DATA THROUGH AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY I WILL SURE THESE FINDINGS WITH YOU TODAY KEEP IN MIND THEY ARE LUMINARY IN NUMBERS ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE. DATA ON OVERDOSE SHOW THAT FEDERAL DRUG RELATED OVERDOSES HAVE BEEN INCREASING SINCE TWENTY- TWO THOUSAND SIX. ELIMINATE DATA FROM TWENTY TWENTY INDICATE THAT DRUG RELATED OVERDOSES HAVE RAPIDLY INCREASED FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. FOR EXAMPLE FROM JANUARY THROUGH AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY YOU SEEN FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHT DRUG RELATED FATAL OVERDOSES. THIS COMPARES TO FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX JOINT RELATED HATER OVERDOSES FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF. TWENTY NINETEEN THAT'S A 32% INCREASE. IN PARTICULAR THERE HAD BEEN A RAPID INCREASE IN FENTANYL RELATED OVERDOSES. THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THANK YOU KNOW RELATED FATAL OVERDOSES OCCURRING JANUARY THROUGH AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY. COMPARED TO NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN. TWENTY NINETEEN. CENTER NOW CONTRIBUTES TO MORE OPIOID RELATED FATAL OVERDOSES IN EITHER HERRON OR PRESCRIPTION OPIATES EXCLUDING SYNTHETICS. AND FENTANYL RELATED FATAL OVERDOSES ARE ESPECIALLY PREVALENT IN TO. GIVE ME YEAH PREVALENT AMONG INDIVIDUALS TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE. PSYCHOSTIMULANT WITH THE ABUSE OF POTENTIAL SUCH AS METHAMPHETAMINE AND ECSTASY REMAIN A CONCERN FOR THE DEPARTMENT. FROM JANUARY THROUGH AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY PSYCHOSTIMULANT WITH ABUSE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTED TO. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY FATAL OVERDOSES. UP 38% FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN TWENTY NINETEEN. IN SUMMARY THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FOR SYNTHETIC OPIATES EXCLUDING METHADONE IS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BASED ON PAST WERE TELLING TWO TRENDS HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT ATTRIBUTE THE TWENTY TWENTY X. AXIS STEPS TO ANYONE BECAUSE AT THIS POINT. I WOULD NOW TRANSITION TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON- CITY KEEPS WORK WITH SUICIDE PREVENTION THE CDC GRANT. PUBLIC HEALTH RECOGNIZES THAT SUICIDE IS PREVENTABLE COMPLEX ISSUE AND CDPH IS WORKING TO ADDRESS UNDERLYING CAUSES TO KEEP SUICIDE FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. HISTORICALLY OUR ROLE HAS BEEN ON SUICIDE SURVEILLANCE ND EDUCATION UP UNTIL SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY CITY PH WAS AWARDED A GRANT FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. AND NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND ANNUALLY OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD TO IMPLEMENT A SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM. PURPOSE OF THE GRANT IS TO IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE. ADOPTION IMPLEMENTATION OF SUICIDE. L. C. PH TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND DATA TO THIRTEEN COUNTIES WITH HIGH RATES OF SUICIDE. TARGETING COMMUNITY SUCH AS YOU VETERANS AN OLDER ADULT MALES. THANK YOU FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT MEETS SPECIFIC CRITERIA WILL BE FUNDED TO IMPLEMENT THE SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIES PERTAINING TO REDUCING ACCESS TO LETHAL MEANS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BRIEF INTERVENTIONS.

CITY PH WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING AND ALIGNING STATE WHAT TO SACRAMENTO EFFORTS AND RESOURCES THROUGH PLANNING AND COLLABORATION ACROSS THEY BURST PARTNERS AND SYSTEMS AS NOTED. BY OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKER. ONCE KIDS TO A FIRST STEP IN X. ITS SUICIDE PREVENTION WORK BY APPLYING AND RECEIVING SUICIDE PREVENTION GRANT FROM CDC. THE GRANT ONLY HAS THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTIES. THE CDC GRANT WILL ALLOW C. PH TO AMPLIFY THE STRATEGIES OUTLINED IN THE SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN AT THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES PROPOSED FOR THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION ARE MORE SUBSTANTIAL AND BEYOND THE SCOPE OF CDPH NEW CDC GRANT. THE SUICIDE PLAN ALLIANCES WHAT FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES FOUR KEY STRATEGIES AND TWELVE GOALS. IT REQUIRE SHEPHERDING AND EVALUATING THE SYSTEM APPROACH TO SUICIDE IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT PREVENTION SCREENING TREATMENT TREATMENT IN THE PROVISIONS OF EQUITABLE SERVICES ACROSS. THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. MUCH MUCH BEYOND THE SCOPE- THAT THE CDC GRANT CURRENTLY HAPPENS. THE C. PH WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION AS ENVISIONED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL KELLY. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS AND I WILL BE ANSWERING BOTH OF OUR QUESTIONS BOTH QUESTIONS ONE INTO FOR ADMISSIONS JOHN MYSELF WOULD TO- START BY ACKNOWLEDGING. AT THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST AS WORK AS WELL AS THE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION'S WORK IN THIS SPACE AND DIRECTOR EWING. OVERALL AS MISS MORALIS STATED CALIFORNIA'S SUICIDE RATE IS LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AT TEN POINT SEVEN FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE COMPARED WITH FOURTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND NATIONALLY HOWEVER THESE RATES ARE NOT CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SOME REGIONS OF OUR STATE HAVE HIGHER RATES OF COMPLETED SUICIDE THAN OTHERS. IN PARTICULAR AND ARE RURAL AND NORTHERN PARTS OF THE STATE. THE COUNTY I'M SORRY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS IN CALIFORNIA AS PREVIOUSLY STATED WHITE MEDIC COUNT FOR SEVEN IN TEN DEATHS BY SUICIDE ALTHOUGH MORE WOMEN AND YOUTH OF COLOR ARE AT RISK OF ATTEMPTING DEATH BY SUICIDE. EVERY CALIFORNIA COUNTY IS REQUIRED UNDER TITLE NINE REGULATIONS TO OPERATE A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CRISIS LINE FOR ITS RESIDENTS AND THESE CONTINUE TO BE A CRITICAL ACCESS POINT. FOR INDIVIDUALS. IN NEED GIVEN THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE FIRST PLACE A PERSON WITH SUICIDAL IDEATION WILL TURN TO AS A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER. HOWEVER SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT CALIFORNIA SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN DRIVEN BY COUNTIES AND I JUST A FUNDED INITIATIVES. FIND THE PASSAGE ABOUT ME JUST A IN TWO THOUSAND AND FUR. COUNTIES MADE SUICIDE PREVENTION ONE OF OUR MAIN STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND OLLECTIVELY INVESTED. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF AND JUST A DOLLARS INTO STRATEGIC INITIATIVE TO ENHANCE THE OVERALL STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION. AND WE DID THAT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF COMMENTS I WHICH IS THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY.

OUR CALLS WENT UP TO EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND THEN IN APRIL THEY INCREASE TO THREE THOUSAND AND THEY REMAIN ABOUT THAT NOW. BUT WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT. FEBRUARY THOSE CALLS WERE ALL SUICIDE. PREVENTION MARCH AND APRIL AND THROUGHOUT THE PAST YEAR THEY'VE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON KOPET HELPING PEOPLE GET HOOKED UP WITH FOOD BANKS THEY'VE BEEN MORE OF A RESOURCE THAN THEY HAVE. FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION- TODAY COME A SECOND TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS FUNDED BY COUNTY SUCH AS EACH MIND MATTERS. FUNDAMENTAL WHICH IS OUR SPANISH LANGUAGE CAMPAIGN OF EACH ROUND MIND MATTERS AND KNOW THE SIGNS SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS COMING SUPPORTS COUNTIES IN INTEGRATING THE STATEWIDE CAMPAIGNS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH. A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND RESOURCE NAVIGATION IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE WE WANT TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EQUITY ISSUES AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING SUICIDE PREVENTION IN WAY THAT MAKES SENSE TO THE PEOPLE WE ARE PROVIDING IT TO. THEM I JUST SAY ALSO FINDS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THREE CRISIS INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. COUNTY IS ALSO OPERATE WARM LINE'S MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES AND SERVICE THE BACK END ON SUICIDE PREVENTION LINES. OF THESE SERVICES- THEY'RE AVAILABLE COUNTY WIDE WITH NO. COST TO THE PERSON WHO'S RECEIVING THE SERVICES THAT WE ARE NOT BILLING DOESN'T MATTER YOU HAVE KAISER IF YOU HAVE MEDIC CALORIE OF NO INSURANCE. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE SAY FUNDS COUNTIES ARE ALSO FUNDING A BRAVE TRAININGS FOR HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS SCHOOLS ARE EMPLOYERS AND COMMUNITY OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH FOR STATE. ASSIST AS WELL AS QUESTION PERCENT PERSUADE AND REFER TRAININGS- ST ARE COUNTY THE ASSIST TRAINING. HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO LAY PEOPLE. AND OUR VETERANS SYSTEM OF CARE MANY VETERANS ARE HESITANT TO REACH OUT TO THE CURRENT VETERANS ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS THEIR SUICIDALITY AND THEY'RE ALSO HAS A CHANCE TO REACH OUT. THROUGH NINE ONE ONE SO ASSIST HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN REDUCING OUR NUMBERS OF COMPLETED SUICIDES. PER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING- WE HAVE DATA WE HAVE AN OFFICE WE WANT TO SHARE THAT THE DATA AND OUR BEST PRACTICES BECAUSE SUICIDE PREVENTION IS NOT SIMPLY ADDRESSED WITH A CRISIS LINE OR A HOTLINE. YEAH WE NEED TO REDUCE STIGMA TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICES FOCUSING ON MAKING MENTAL HEALTH. THE FOCUS BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE MENTAL HEALTH. WITH RESPECT TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN TREATMENT IN PARTICULAR OVERDOSE PREVENTION EACH COUNTY ALSO HAS A SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION FIVE YEAR PLAN WITH MEASURABLE GOALS TIED TO ARE COUNTY SPECIFIC DATA PREVENTION PLANS ARE GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW BECAUSE PREVENTING ADDICTION FOR USE IS VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN FOR IT UP ALL SO WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON STRATEGIES THAT TEND TO YOUTH VERSUS THOSE WHO ARE FOR ADULTS DIFFERENT BANKS- SO COUNTIES AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE DONE A LOT TO KEEP OUTPATIENT SERVICES AVAILABLE VIA TELEHEALTH OR EVEN IN PERSON BUT ACCESS TO RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AND RECOVERY RESIDENTS FORCED OR SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENTS HAS BEEN CHALLENGING DURING COLD BECAUSE OF THIS THE THINGS THAT WE MENTIONED IN OUR FIRST PANEL. FOR EXAMPLE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT WOULD BENEFIT FROM SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO ADAPT EXISTING FACILITIES OR EXPAND INTO NEW ONES AND ALTHOUGH THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL AND UNNECESSARY MODEL STEP DOWNS RECOVERY RESIDENCES OR SOAKS UP LIVING ENVIRONMENTS- CANNOT BE FUNDED THROUGH MEDICARE. WE KNOW THE RISK OF OVERDOSE RELATED DEATHS IS OVERWHELMINGLY HIGH FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION AND WE BELIEVE CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR PARTNERS AT CDC ARE REGARDING PRISON RELEASE POPULATIONS IS KEY. CDCR REPORTED THAT IT OFFERS NALOXONE OR NOR CAN I TO INMATES UPON DISCHARGE IN UP THAT THAT MEDICATION WHICH INDICATES A REAL NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE PROVIDES COUNTIES WITH ADEQUATE NOTIFICATION IN COORDINATION AROUND PRISON JUST CHARGES. OVERALL COMMUNITY BASED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PREVENTION IS CURRENTLY FUNDED VERY MINIMALLY I WITH OUR SAM'S A BLOCK GRANT BUT THOSE FUNDS MUST COMPETE WITH OTHER BLACK GRANT SERVICES SUCH AS RECOVERY RESIDENTS SCHOOL BASED SERVICES THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT BE COVERED UNDER DRUG HOW. MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT DEDICATED INVESTMENT WILL NEED TO BE MADE IN OPIOID OVERDOSE PREVENTION- THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS A SOME OF OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE STATED THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT HEROIN OR OPIOIDS WE ARE SEEING FENTANYL WHICH IS AN OPIOID- ADULTERATED COCAINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE RESULTING AND A DIFFERENT KIND OF AN OVERDOSE. AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE AS EASILY TRACKED FOR THE CDPH DASHBOARD. AS MISS MORALIS STATED. IS MORE ON- SO WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON ON OVERDOSE PREVENTION MOVING IT SO THAT IT'S MORE ON PAR WITH THE TYPE OF SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING COUNTIES RECEIVE THROUGH AN HSA EVER REALLY GOING TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT ADDICTION. THE THREAT OF FENNEL AGAIN IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING OVERDOSES AMONG OUR YOUNGER POPULATION TO MAKE LATIN ME LACK AWARENESS ABOUT. OF THE AT RISK OF OVERDOSES UNDER MEDI CAL ARE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF RESIDENTIAL DRUG TREATMENT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE FUNGIBLE UNDER THE I AM D. EXCLUSION. AND EXCHANGE FOR INCREASED COMMUNITY BASED AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES AND SO WHILE THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS GROUNDBREAKING. NATIONALLY IT REFORMED OUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND MEDICAID. IT WAS IMPLEMENTED ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES HAVE YET TO IMPLEMENT THEY'RE NOT HOLDING OFF BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THE BENEFITS TO MAKE THE SWITCH. IT REALLY IS ABOUT A KANEMI OF SCALE. IT IS ABOUT NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO ESTABLISH NEW SERVICES AND THE ABILITY TO ABSORB THE DEPENDENT DEMAND FOR SERVICES. IN ADDITION TO MORE TARGETED INVESTMENT OF S. U. D. THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE STATE SHOULD CONTINUE TO TARGET SCHOOLS FOR BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. I COUNTY SPECIAL EXPERTISE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND HOLISTIC FAMILY COMMUNITY COLLEGE MAKE US IDEAL PARTNERS FOR EXPANDED SCHOOL BASED PARTNERSHIPS MOVING FORWARD. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS THAT RECOVERY HAPPENS. THANK YOU. MICHELLE CABRERA. NOT SURE OF YOUR COMMENT OR INCLUDED IN DR KELLY'S OR IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE WHERE. GROUT ALL HOLD OPERATIVE FUN THANK YOU. WITH THAT I WILL PULL IT BACK UP TO THE DíAS TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND- FIRST I WANT TO ACTUALLY THANK AND APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION IS DOING ON WORKING ON DEVELOPING A STATEWIDE. SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN AND WANTED TO- GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY IF YOU COULD AFTER HAVING HEARD FROM DH CS AND CDPH ABOUT THEIR SUICIDE PREVENTION WORK AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE COULD CREATE A COORDINATED RESPONSE- I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. HAPPY TO THANK YOU- THANK ARAMBULA- YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT I HAVE HEARD TODAY AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IS THAT B. YOU KNW BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES HEALTH CARE SERVICES- THE COMMISSION THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. YOU KNOW WE WOULD INCLUDE IN THAT DISCUSSION THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR- PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVING- EDMONTON PARENTING. FAMILIES YEAH EVEN FIRST FIVE RIGHT BUT ALSO ON THE LOCAL SIDE ARE COUNTIES OUR SCHOOLS- WE HAVE WHAT IT TAKES IN CALIFORNIA TO FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESS SUICIDE RISKS AND RATES AND BRING THAT DOWN. M. THE CAPUCHINS RECOMMENDATION TO CREATE THE OFFICES HAVE PREVENTION IS REALLY ABOUT BRINGING TOGETHER. THE TOOLS THE PARTNERS THE STRATEGIES AND THE LEADERSHIP IT'S THIS FUNDAMENTAL LEADERSHIP ROLE OF NOT TAKING OVER WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT COORDINATING SUPPORTING EMBRACING THE STRAIN THAT AS DIRECTOR KELLY TALKED ABOUT. IS IN PLACE IN MANY IF NOT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S THIS MUSICIANS OF INTERSECTION ALITY BETWEEN EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH LAW ENFORCEMENT HOSPITALS- M. IT'S THESE AREAS WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO. THE STATE IS TRYING TO SUPPORT PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS AND POLICIES IN COMMUNITIES WITHOUT DICTATING ARE MANDATING HOW THEY DO IT BUT THROUGH A FACILITATION AND CAPACITY BUILDING STRATEGY THAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND WE NEED TO DO THAT IN CONCERT WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. WE WERE INVOLVED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CALVET PROPOSAL. AND I HAD THE FORTUNE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE REGION AT NINE ADMINISTRATOR WITH FEEDBACK. ABOUT THE STATE'S APPLICATION AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT OUR OUR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS NOT AS ROBUST. AS ARE PREPARED AS IN OTHER AREAS FIRE SUPPRESSION- EVACUATIONS RIGHT WE HAVE DONE WE ARE BETTER PREPARED IN SOME OF THESE OTHER AREAS THEN WE ARE IN THE BEER HALL SPACE. AND I WOULD AG ADD THAT THAT INCLUDES SUICIDE PREVENTION WORK AND SO I THINK FOR ME THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE RESOURCES AND THE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE EXPERTISE AND THE TOOLS. TO FUNDAMENTALLY. ADDRESS THE RISKS THAT WE FACE WHEN IT COMES TO SUICIDE PREVENTION AND ACTUALLY GET TO THIS NOTION OF ZERO- WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF COORDINATION AND ENGAGEMENT. AND THAT'S THE PIECE THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY MISSING I DON'T KNOW THAT THE ANSWER IS TO. ARM YOU KNOW CONSOLIDATE THESE STRATEGIES BECAUSE THERE ARE REASONS WHY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS DOING WHAT IT'S DOING AND WE NEED TO LEVERAGE THE STRENGTHS OF EACH OF THESE PARTNERS. AND BLEND THEM IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPACTFUL ACROSS WHAT IS AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE AND COMPLICATED STATE- YOU KNOW AND I AND I WOULD YOU KNOW LOOK NO FARTHER THAN. THE NEEDS OF OUR IN OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. AND THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE OFTEN FIND. CONNECTING TRIBAL SERVICES WITH FEDERAL SERVICE SINCE COUNTY BASED SERVICE AND STATE SERVICE SINCE- THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED WORK THAT IF WE REALLY CAN BRING TOGETHER THE VOICES AND THE VISION OF ALL OF THESE PARTNERS WE CAN MAKE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON YOUR BUSINESS JUST AYE PREVENTION AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT COLBERT HAS MADE MENTAL HEALTH. SOMETHING THAT ALL OF MOST OF US IF NOT ALL OF US UNDERSTAND THEIR WE HAVE SEEN DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS IN STIGMA DRAMATIC INCOME ENHANCEMENTS OF PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF WHY MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS ALL OF OUR WORK WITH EMPLOYERS WITH EDUCATORS- WITH WHAT YOU KNOW WE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS NONTRADITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS. WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN MENTAL HEALTH THEY'RE RECEPTIVE ATTY TO THIS CONVERSATION TODAY IS TREMENDOUSLY GREATER THAN IT WAS PRE PANDEMIC. IT'S INCUMBENT ON CALIFORNIA TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS BUT THE LEADERSHIP IN PLACE AND REALLY WORK ACROSS THE MANY STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES INCLUDING SOME OF OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. TO DEPLOYED A STRATEGY THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN WAYS THAT WE CAN GET TO ZERO. THANK YOU TO OPT IS YOUR QUESTION NO IT DOES AND- I THINK WE'VE HEARD DR GOLLY SAY THAT COULD BE NINETEEN SHOULD BE AN EXCEL AROUND FOR MUCH CHANGE AND REALLY WOULD. HOPE THAT DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE CAN SEE. THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITHIN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUICIDES IN TERMS OF OUR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND THE REAL NEED FOR US TO HAVE. COLLABORATION AND SO IF I COULD I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A POINTED QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BUT IT. REALLY IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT SUICIDES AND- OVERDOSE DEATHS ARE DEATHS OF DESPAIR. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I REALLY FEEL THAT IT BEGGING FOR REAL STRONG LEADERSHIP. IN OUR STATE CAPITOL AND I'M HPING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CAN DESCRIBE HOW IT PLANS TO PROVIDE INCREASED COORDINATION AND POWERFUL LEADERSHIP IN GENERAL ON THESE ISSUES. THE QUESTION IS FOR EITHER DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. OUR DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WAS GOING TO RESPOND. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS- THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES IS FULLY COMMITTED TO WORKING ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS- AND AREAS IN THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING ALL SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO REDUCE SUICIDES. AND GET ZERO I JUST TO BE CLEAR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE VERY COMMITTED TO THAT EFFORT. YEAH I WOULDN'T AT. THANK YOU YEAH THIS IS MONICA MORALES FOR THE RECORD I DEFINITELY ECHO ON THE SPEAKERS WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS YOU KNOW FOR QUITE SOME TIME WE HAVEN'T HAD OBVIOUSLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT WE'VE WAITED A PRIORITY IN TERMS OF OUR SURVEILLANCE- IN TERMS OF THEIR REPORTING THAT WE TRYING TO DO TO REALLY AT LEAST BRING THE AWARENESS UP OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE ORGANIZED INTERNALLY IN OUR DEPARTMENT ACROSS PROGRAMS. AND FOR US IT'S A HEALTHY COMMUNITIES APPROACH AS A WHOLE BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH YOU ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RISK FACTORS SUCH AS HOW TO BACK WHO PLAYS A ROLE WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW THIS IMPACTS CHRONIC DISEASES AND SO THESE ARE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING CE DEPARTMENT BUT IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO HAVE THE BACKBONE AT THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE. PREVENTION PLAN IS OUTLINING IN SO WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF ONE ON ONES WITH A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT SISTER DEPARTMENTS WORKING OBVIOUSLY WITH THE COMMISSION AS WELL WHEN NEEDED- AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD AS A THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE STATED TO REALLY MAKE AN INTENTIONAL ALIGNMENT ACROSS THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND IN PROVIDING A-STRONG STRONG LEADERSHIP ROLE TO REALLY GET THIS GOING IT'S NOT FOR THE LACK OF WORK THAT'S TAKING PLCE. THEY DIDN'T EMBRACE IN THAT VISION THAT THE PREVENTION PLAN HAS AND PUTTING THE RESOURCES IN THE LEADERSHIP. IN PLACE TO KIND OF MOVE THAT FORWARD. I FEEL ALL. TO UPLIFT MY- CALL IN SEEK MATES UP. FOR THE OFFICE OF. SUICIDE PREVENTION AS WELL AS- BE QUITE GRATEFUL FOR THEADMINISTRATION AND SECURING THE CAL HOPE- GRANT FROM FEMA AND SAM SO I HAVE BEEN A- BIG SUPPORTER OF PEER LEVEL- INDIVIDUALS AND BELIEVE THIS IS A GREAT STEP. FORWARD FOR US AS A STATE. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH THE PANEL THREE AND MOVE ON TO PANEL FOR ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND PROPOSALS SPECIFIC TO HIGH NEED POPULATIONS. WE HAVE EIGHT PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL AND WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED. IF WE CAN PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD EVENING I'M STEPPING CLENDENIN DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND I'M JOINED BY CHRIS EATON SAYS DEBBIE DIRECTOR OF OUR FRIENDS LIKE SERVICES DIVISIONS. WHEN ASKED TO DISCUSS TWO ITEMS THAT COMMUNITY CARE COLLABORATIVE PILOT PROJECT AND THE I. S. T. DIVERSION UPDATES US ALL. BOTH OF THESE ARE RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS HAVE BEEN FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES. AND BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THE DEPARTMENT. CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND YOU ARE PENDING ADMISSION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM WHICH OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASING ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT ACTIVATED CAPACITY IN ITS STATE HOSPITALS. PARTNERED WITH THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S TO ESTABLISH JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN CONTACTED WITH LOS ANGELES TRYING TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAMS. EACH OF THESE EFFORTS HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE INCREASING REFERRALS TO THE DEPARTMENT HOWEVER DESPITE ALL THE EFFORTS THE REFERRALS HAVE CONTINUED TO. GROW AND EXCEED CAPACITY. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THAT WERE PENDING PLACEMENT TO IDIOCY TREATMENT PROUD HUBBARD. OVER EIGHT HUNDRED SINCE THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN THIS NUMBER GROW SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO CURB. SO IN NINETEEN THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE AGENDA SH TODAY THE WAIT LIST IS NEARING SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PATIENTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS WAY UNLESS THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE INCREASING PRESSURE TO TIMELY AMEND I S. T. DEPENDENCE FOR TREATMENT. EVERY YEAR OVER THE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT HAS CONDUCTED AN ANALYSIS OF THE I. S. T. POPULATION TREATED IN THAT SYSTEM AND THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS WE HAVE FOUND. THE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS AND MELTED I WASN'T TALKING TO STAND TRIAL HAVE NOT RECEIVED SUFFICIENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE PRIOR TO THEIR ADMISSION. INNER CYCLING IN AND OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. APPROXIMATELY 50% HAVE NOT ACCESS COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR ARREST. IN 45% HAVE HAD FIFTEEN OR MORE REST BEFORE THEY'RE COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS SH ADDITIONALLY NEARLY ONE HALF WERE UNSHELTERED. HOMELESS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARRESTS. THIS YEAR THE PART AS PER. TO ESTABLISH THE COMMUTER CARE. PROJECT COMPETENT TO STAND. TRIAL WE ARE REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND WORK POSITIONS AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION I'M GOING FOR THIS EFFORT STE UNDER THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WITH A CONTRACT WITH COUNTIES TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE AND TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES. AND THROUGH THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WE SEEK TO PROMOTE A COMMUNITY BASED CONTINUUM OF CARE OR FELONY EYES TWO DEFENDANTS IN THE STATE. THAT SUPPORTS THE PRINCIPLES OF DE INSTITUTIONALIZATION FOR THESE DEFENDANTS WE CAN BEST BE CARED FOR IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING IN THE COMMUNITY. WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT DEFENDANTS WITH CERTAIN VIOLENT CHARGES MAY NEED TO BE TREATED IN SECURE FACILITIES INCLUDING JAIL TREATMENT FACILITIES. AND STAFF THE STATE HOSPITALS. WE ALSO SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS WITH STREAMLINED RESPONSIBILITY AND ALIGNED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL FOR THIS POPULATION TO DRIVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES. AND REDUCED INCARCERATION RECIDIVISM RECIDIVISM AND HOMELESSNESS. FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. SH WE ARE. STATE TIMELY. OF COMPETENCY AS- FAR IS TWO DEFENDANTS. WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL ON THE I. S. T. WAITING LIST AND WHEN THE IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSAL WILL REALLY BE DEPENDENT UPON WHICH COUNTIES PARTICIPATE AND THE NUMBER OF ID I JUST USED TO BE SERVED BY THE COUNTIES AT THE LEVEL OF FUNDING REQUEST IN THE NUMBER I S. T. IS THAT COULD BE SERVED BY THE FUNDING AND THE PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE WAIT LIST NEXT FISCAL YEAR. HOWEVER UNTIL WE KNOW WHICH COUNTIES WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HIGHEST USED TO BE SERVED BY THE COUNTIES AND HOW QUICKLY THE COUNTIES CAN BEGIN SERVING THE HIGHEST USE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHAT THAT. ACTUAL IMPACTS COULD BE. SH IN ADDITION TO THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WE ARE ALSO REQUESTING ONE TIME FUNDING OF FORTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION IN GENERAL FUND IN BUDGET YEAR. AND ONE POINT TWO MILLION ANNUALLY FOR FOUR YEARS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TO EXPAND. OUR EXISTING I. S. T. DIVERSION PROGRAM. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT INCLUDED ONE TIME HUNDRED MILLION IN GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH THE I. S. T. DIVERSION PROGRAM. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT CONTRACTS WITH CHINESE TO DEVELOP NEW OR EXPAND EXISTING DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH BEEN FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL OR HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE COUNTY COMPANY. STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES SH I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO DEBBIE DIRECTOR PROCEEDINGS WILL PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL. DETAILS ABOUT BUT THESE PROPOSALS AND HIGHLIGHTS ON OUR EFFORTS TO DATE IN IMPLEMENTING IS TO DIVERSION PROGRAM. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S CHRIS DANCING DEPUTY DIRECTOR PROGRAMS LIKE SERVICE SENSE. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE DETAILS OF THE MOVIE CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. I S. CHEESE LIKE TO CALL THE CCGT. BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY ACKNOWLEDGING- A WHILE NOT TO THE SAME SCALE CRISES EXPERIENCED BY THE PANDEMIC OVER THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING ANOTHER TYPE OF CRISIS AND NOT THROUGH THE INCREASING CRIMINALIZATION OF THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS- THE IMPACT OF THIS CRISIS IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE RATE OF THOSE BEING ARRESTED AND COMMITTED AS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. AND STEPHANIE NOTED OVER THE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT HAS INCREASED ITS CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THE INCREASING NUMBER OF AYE ISSUES REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S OVER NINE HUNDRED BAD BETWEEN OUR STATE HOSPITALS IN JBC CHEAPER GROUNDS AND MORE RECENTLY STARTED TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR COUNCILS. INCLUDING DIVERSION AND A COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM THE CCP PROPOSAL IS THE NEXT STEP IN THIS PASS AND EVOLUTION OF LESSONS. LEARNED FROM THESE PARTNERSHIPS. HI STEPHANIE MENSCH WE'RE PER IN. OF TWO ONE THIRTY THREE POINT TWO AND YEAR IN A HUNDRED THIRTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING. SOME OF THE KEY FEATURES OF THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE ONE ON GOING FUNDING WHICH ARE DEVELOPMENT A RISK- OF BUILDING OUT NEW PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. ONE TIME FUNDS TO SUPPORT PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS BY CURTIS. LITTLE TOWN NEEDS. ARE AND THREE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT NOW WILL BE APPLIED IF IDEAS H. AS. WELL AS OUR CONTRACTED EXPERTS. SO THIS REALLY IS A WHOLE LIST FUNDING. THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR TREATMENT SERVICES HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION WHICH OFTEN REPRESENTS THE HIGHEST MORE USERS IN THE SYSTEM- AND AS WELL AS THE STAFF- CERTAINS INDIVIDUALS- OUR VISION FOR THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT IS OUR PARTICIPATING CHANNELS TO PROVIDE A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHICH CAN INCLUDE BOTH WALKED IN AND WALKED TREATMENT SETTINGS EVERYTHING FROM JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT TO ONE LAKH RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS. EVERYTHING BETWEEN. IN ADDITION PARTICIPATING COUNTIES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO DSHS FOR THOSE. WHO BEHIND US THE WHOLE CARE. I THINK I SHOULD JUST TAKE A- TO SAVE WE RECOGNIZE THAT COMPANIES NOW WE'RE TALKING WITH DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO EVERY LEVEL OF CARE READILY AVAILABLE IN TIME FOR A JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IMAGINATION. SO WITHOUT WE FULLY EXPECT THAT THE CONTINUUM OF SERVICES UTILIZED IN THE FIRST AND SECOND YEAR OF THE PROGRAM MAY LOOK VERY DIFFERENT. THEN IT WILL BE IN FUTURE YEARS PARTICULARLY AS ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THE BANKING OF A WHOLE COUNTRY WALMART EIGHT. WHAT TO THIS IS A DUMB. PROJECT BECAUSE- ONE THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT WILL PARTICIPATE AND SHE WERE PROPOSING AN INITIAL THREE YEAR DEMONSTRATION HEARING AID WHICH WILL RUN THROUGH THE SCHOOL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THIS IS THE PERIOD IN WHICH WILL COLLECT OUT COMING FISCAL DATA FROM THE COUNTIES TO. ROUTE ONE EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STREAMLINING RESPONSIBILITY TO DRIVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES IS DEFINITELY TALKED ABOUT AS WELL AS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FUNDING WORK OPPOSING. WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING ON FUNDING REALLY BECAUSE THE COUNTIES THAT ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROJECT WILL BE ASSUMING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE COLONY I ASKED YOU POPULATION IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND- AND- IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT THE INVESTMENT MADE IN THIS SPACE WILL BE ONGOING AS WELL. I'M SO JUST TO KIND OF RUN THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THE FUNDING PROPOSED IN THIS PROJECT- AS MENTIONED WE'RE PROPOSING IS ONGOING BASS LINE OF FUNDING FOR JUSTIN COUNTIES WITH SOME ADDITIONAL ONE TIME INVESTMENT. FOR THE BASELINE FUNDING THIS IS WHAT WE CALL OUR EVENING WALK OR ANYTHING THAT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO TRANSFER TREATMENT HOUSING AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES. WE DEVELOP THIS FUNDING ESTIMATE BASED ON A PROJECTED TOTAL ANNUAL POPULATION- OR TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHU I. S. JEANS. WHICH IS REALLY BASED ON A THREE YEAR AVERAGE ACTUAL AYE ISSUE REFERRALS THAT OUR DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED- FROM A SAMPLING OF LARGE MEDIUM AND. SMALL SIZED TOWNS. CONSISTENT WITH METHOD OF PSH ASKED TO AND HOW. TOTAL EACH. HOW BASED ON THEIR ACT THREE AB TRYING. ALAMEDA APPLIED THIS AS TO HOW. LEVEL TO A PROPOSED RATE ALLOCATION OF 1-008-000-3405 FOR EACH PATIENT THIS RATE IS EQUIVALENT TO THE AVERAGE AND WILL COST YOU TREATING ISTEP. SHANE IN THE STATE HOSPITAL BACK- WE PROPOSE THAT THIS FUNDING WOULD BE TO COUNCIL MEMBER ALLOCATION PROCESS. IN ADDITION TO OUR ON GOING FUNDING ON THE FIRST YEARWILL ALSO INCLUDE ONE TIME FUNDING- WERE DECIMATED FORTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO REMAINS ON THE PSH WAIT LIST AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT IS NOT THAT IT NEEDED TO BE A SIEGE PROGRAM. THAT IN ADDITION UP TO THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION FUNDS- WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE WHICH CAN THEN BE USED TO SUPPORT ALL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION COSTS THAT INCLUDES. ON START UP COSTS RELATED TO RECRUITMENT HIRING TRAINING AND STAFF AS WELL AS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT- COUNTY I ASKED YOU POPULATION. IN ADDITION WE WOULD PROPOSE TO TRANSFER ANY FINDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED TO COUNTIES. OTHER CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS ARE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE ARE ANY CHINESE- WHO ARE CURRENTLY CONTRACTING WITH. US ARE FOR THE DIVERSION PROGRAM WE WERE JUST SUPPOSED TO TRANSFER ALL THOSE FANS- IN ONE FELL SWOOP. TODAY COUNTY- TO ALLOW FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY IN MUSICALS. ONE OTHER PROPOSAL HIGHLIGHTS. AND AS I NOTED EARLIER COUNTIES WILL HAVE ACCESS TO DSHS FOR IRIS RESTORATION TREATMENT- NEED WOULD PROPOSE TO DO THIS REAL ESTABLISHING AN ALLOCATION OF BAD DAYS FOR HER TO SCREENING HOW HIS ARM AND- ARE ALSO PROPOSING THAT COMES WITH YES OUR PREMIUM RATE STARTING AT A HUNDRED AND 50% ARE CURRENTLY BAD RATE AND THEN SHARED RATE. STRUCTURE WITH CRIMINAL INCREASES AND THAT RATES WILL BE APPLIED FOR ANY BAD DAYS AND ACCESS ACCOUNT. OF EACH AND- IN ADDITION COUNTY. EIGHT WITH WILL BE REQUIRED TO TREATMENT PLANS MAKES GOING REPORTS ON BASIS AND ON AFFORDABLE BASIS SENATE DEMOGRAPHIC AS WELL AS TREATMENT DATA BANKS ARE. I MENTIONED EARLIER IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE- THE PLAN TO EVALUATE THE NEED TO REASSESS THE BASELINE FUNDING AMOUNT FOR COUNTIES BASED ON UPON ANY CHANGES TO THE OVERALL GROWTH IN COUNTY POPULATION THAT MAY DRIVE YOU CRAZY. HM AS WELL AS ANY COSTA FACTOR THAT NEED. INCREASE OUTSIDE THE TERMS CONTROL. NEC AT NAY SHE IS FROM THE WILL PER IN THE IN THE LEVEL WILL REMAIN WITH THE- BUT MUST BE WITHIN. IN ANY- INTERVENTIONS OR EXTREME SOLUTIONS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF I. S. G. INDIVIDUALS DECLARED HIGHEST G. WE ARE NOT. TO DO THE BASE LEVEL OF. AND AS PART OF THAT REINVESTMENT OF SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE S. H. THEIR PLANS WITHOUT REINVESTMENT. WITH RESPECT TO PARTICIPATING COUNTIES PARTICIPATING COUNTIES ARE STILL TO BE DETERMINED. IDEAS EACH HAS- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER DEVELOP THEIR FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS BASED UPON MODEL OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT COUNTIES OF BEARINGS SIZES AND WE'RE CURRENTLY IN- DISCUSSIONS WITH INTERESTED COUNTY SEVERAL COUNCILS. I WILL PROVIDE UPDATES AND THEN IT WOULD BE CHEN REGARDING WHO- THIS IS PART OF THE PROJECT. I WAS THERE AND SHIFT OVER TO THE DIVERSION PROGRAM I. SAW START OFF FIRST BY PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON THE DIVERSION PROGRAM THEN WILL MOVE INTO OUR NEW SPENDING LAST. TO RECAP DCH WAS AUTHORIZED ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF DIVERSION PROGRAMS. I AM TARGETS NICHOLS WHO ARE HERE FOUND I. S. T. OR LIKELY TO BE FOUND I S. T. Y. CHARGE AND ADOLESCENT OTHERS. CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY. OF THE NINE OF THE WILL HUNDRED MILLION NINETY NINE FIVE MILLION WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO FIND COUNTY SPECIFIC NINETY ONE MILLION WAS EARMARKED FOR FIFTEEN COUNCILS BUT THE HIGHEST RATE OF FELONY. YOUR CURLS H. AND THEN ANOTHER HALF MILLION WAS NOTABLE TO OTHER COUNTIES REPETITIVE APPLICATION PROCESS. REMAINING HUNDRED WAS DEDICATED TO OPERATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAM- AS PART CURRENT MOST CURRENT UPDATE YOU'RE WORKING WITH A TOTAL OF TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT DIVERSION PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE AND HAVE CURRENTLY COMMITTED NINETY SIX POINT ONE MILLION IN FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE EFFORT. HE'S COUNTIES COLLECTIVELY PROJECTED SERVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE INDIVIDUALS WHICH IS 20% HIGHER THAN OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF SEVEN HUNDRED. AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THIRTEEN POUNDS HAVE ACTIVATED THEIR PROGRAMS AND ADDITIONAL SEVEN HOUSEHOLD EXECUTED CONTRACTS ALREADY IN PLACE WITH OUR DEPARTMENT AND HAVE PLANNED ACTIVATION DATES THIS WINTER. NOW ONE COUNTY IS CURRENTLY AND CONTRACTORS BALL AND THEN FOR COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY WRAPPING UP THEIR CONTRACTS. ALL OF THE TOP FIFTEEN POUNDS ORIGINAL YOUR MARKET THIS FUND FUNDING ONE COUNTY HAS OFFICIALLY OPTED OUT MEDIA SUPPORT TEAM FROM OUR WHAT WE CALL ORIGINAL TOXIC CHICHARRONES. AND SOME OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE OPTED FOR A LOWER FUNDING THRESHOLDS ARE COMMENSURATE WITH CERTAIN THE LOWER NUMBER OF CLIENTS THIS IS RESULTED IN SOME SAVINGS THAT INCREASE THE POOL OF FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. AVAILABLE TO OTHER TOWNS. AND SO FOR THOSE REMAINING FRIENDS WE HAVE RELEASE YOU HAD ROUNDS- CHOOSE COUNTY. COUNCIL PREFER. ONE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ANOTHER IN NOVEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN AND HAS SINCE AWARDED FUNDING TO ELEVEN WHICH RUNS. AS OF JUNE. I KNOW THIS IS ALL DATA- BUT AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY- ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN DIVERTED TO EIGHT POUND RUN PROGRAM FUNDED IDEAS EACH THE REASON WHY THIS DATA IS SOLD IS THAT WE- AND THE STATUTE REQUIRES COUNTIES TO SUBMIT DATA NINETY DAYS AFTER THE END OF. EACH QUARTER- AND SO AS AS MAY REVISION APPROACHES WILL BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE. MORE CURRENT DATA- SOME OF THE IN. IN SERVICES AND WAY BY PURCHASING CHINESE INCLUDING. MANAGEMENT YOUR SUPPORT SPECIALIST WHAT IS YOUR CRISIS. EXPANSION OF FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPSAND ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT IN ADDITION A VARIETY OF HOUSING OPTIONS THAT ARE BEING ACCESSED- BY DIVERSION PLANS INCLUDE MASTER LEAST RESIDENCES SUPPORTIVE HOUSING RESIDENTIAL CARE AND SOBER LIVING HOMES AS WELL AS TRANSITIONAL HOUSING- SUPPORTING THE COUNTIES IN THE SPACE HAS KIND OF COME INTO IN IN CHIU BUCKETS ONE IS TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS YES EACH IS FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS IN SUPPORTING COUNTIES THROUGH- DELIVERING TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO DATE ME DELIVER CLOSE TO SEVENTY HOURS OF FORMAL TRAINING ALONG WITH LOTS OF INFORMAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING ACCOUNTS TO NETWORK AND LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN OUR TRAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WAS PRIMARILY FOCUSED. ON TOPICS AROUND INITIAL PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS SO HOW TO IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE CANDIDATES WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS TO USE AND THEN CURRENTLY- TOPICS ARE MORE FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING COUNTIES AS THEY'RE ACTIVATING YOUR PROGRAMS ON INCLUDES THINGS LIKE APPROPRIATE MEDICATION CYCLE PHARMACOLOGY IN CONSIDERATION FOR PRESCRIBERS HOW DID NEEDS REST RISK ASSESSMENTS TO INFORM QUITE TREATMENT PLANS ARE- AND THEN ACTUALLY DOING VERY CASE SPECIFIC CONSULTATIONS WITH EXPERTS AROUND MORE DIFFICULT- DIVERSION HE SAYS. AND THEN THE LAST AREA OF FOCUS BEEN AROUND OUT OF. AND WHAT WE'RE AFTER AND SO WERE REQUIRED COLLECT. OUTLINED IN WELFARE. BECAUSE. THREE SIXTY ONE- AND THEN ALSO AS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN ENACTED BUDGET GST EACH WAS REQUIRED OR IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WORK WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO REPORT ON- ANY TRIAL COURT DATA RELATED TO THAT WATER MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. STATUTE ONE. ONE THOUSAND ONE POINT THREE SIX JUSTER. I GUESS SHARE A COUPLE OF HIGHLIGHTS- FROM THIS DATA COLLECTION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN. TWENTY PROXIMATE NEED FORTY QUARTS SUBMITTED INFORMATION AND REPORTED THAT OVER NINETEEN HUNDRED PETITIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. HAD BEEN RECEIVED AND ABOUT 29% OF THOSE ARE MORE RELATED TO- PARTITIONS ON A FELONY CHARGE. IT ADDITIONALLY QUARTZ REPORTED. SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOR DIVERSION. I WERE GRANTED OF WHICH THIRTY CHEAP. WERE RELATED CHECK. PROBLEMS AREN'T CHARGE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DMCH IS REQUESTING TO EXPAND THE DIVERSION PROGRAM AS STEPHANIE MENTIONED WE ARE REQUESTING OUR ONE TIME FUNDING OF FORTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION TO EXPAND THE CURRENT I. S. G. DIVERSION PROGRAM THIS IS REALLY MADE UP- ABSURDITY SHE MAIN PART. ONE IS- TWENTY EIGHT ALMOST JUST UNDER TWENTY NINE MILLION ARTISTS FOR THE EXPANSION OF DIVERSION PROGRAMS TO ANY NEW CARAMEL THAT- WE'RE NOT ALREADY CONTRACTING. PROJECTING TO SERVE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DEDUCTIBLES WITHOUT FUNDING AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE WOULD BE SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION THAT WOULD BE TARGETED R. G. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL. SERVERS IN OUR EXISTING. BROWN'S SO I TOLD WOULD BE SIX POINT ONE NINE AND ENERGY WE ARE REQUEST THAT FOR PER POSITIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY BALLOT TO. THAT ALLOW IN ORDER POP AND- PROGRAM- AND THEN IN ADDITION LASTLY WE ARE REQUESTING- ARE ENCOURAGED AND IT'S A EXTENSION OF OUR REGIONAL FUNDING- AND THAT REALLY IS DRIVEN BY. THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE SOME FUNDS ON THE TABLE RIGHT TO SPEND EVERY DOLLAR AND STILL NEED A LITTLE EXTRA TIME TO ROLL OUT- THIRD ON COMPETITIVE FUNDING APPLICATION PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN GET THOSE FUNDS OUT. AND JONES G. OBVIOUSLY THOSE FUNDS WILL HAVE THAT FOR MOVIE YEAR. TERMS TO THEM TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS- WITH RISK TO OUR THE QUESTION AROUND WHY YOU'RE SEEKING RESOURCES TO XPAND THE DIVERSION PROGRAM AND WIENER HAPPENED- SINCE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS I THINK I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WOULD YOU LIKE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR HAVE BEEN SOME DELAYS. ON THIS PROGRAM- AND OF. THAT PLANT THE PROGRAMS AND BEGIN DIVERTING INDICATE. ARE DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT THEY WERE- OBVIOUSLY DELAYED DUE TO THE VARIOUS IMPACTS RESULTING FROM THE PANDEMIC- SOME OF THESE. IMPACTS INCLUDE COURT CLOSURES ARE BUDGET UTS AND HIRING FREEZES IN THE ECONOMY MASS RELEASES OF INMATES AT THE LOCAL JAIL AS WELL AS VIRUS OUTBREAKS AT THE JAILS WHICH SORT OF HINDERED SORT OF THOSE OPERATIONAL- PROCESS IS THE REQUIREMENT TO GET IN THERE AND YOU ASSESSMENT OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE JAIL- BUT AS WE SORT OF HEADED INTO FALL AND NOW WINTER- ALONG WITH THE RE OPENING. THE COURTS WE'VE STARTED TO SEE A LOT OF MOVEMENT AND ACTIVITY WITH THESE PROGRAMS AND YOU- EXPECT THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROGRAMS SHOULD BE. UP AND RUNNING. THIS FISCAL YEAR. I'M NOT AND SO SAID THAT IN IN TURN OF WHY SEEKING RESOURCE ONE BIGGEST- STEPHANIE ADDRESS THIS EARLIER ARE WE- SYSTEM HIGH WHY THAT IS DUE TO THE DELAY WITH HIM OF WE NEED REALLY WALKED ALL OF THE OLD SO WE TO ADDRESS THE- AND SO EXPANSION OF DIAPERS WILL IS ONE OF THE FEW OF. ACCURAY FOR AS TO YOU CAN PASS. FOR I G. IN A- SHE KNOWS. AND ALLOW JOHN CHIU COOPER DEFENDANTS BEFORE ACTUALLY BEING TO. AS AN I. S. G. COULD BE A PATH TO REDUCE THE- NUMBER BRIAN CHEESE AND STATE. AND THEN WE ALSO DO YOU KNOW THAT MANY EXISTING COUNTY PROGRAMS HAVE EXPRESSED. IN EXPANDING THEIR PROGRAMS THROUGH- ADDITIONAL FUNDS AND- ACETATE- AND- WE ALSO LEARNED JUST THROUGH OUR ONGOING PARTNERSHIPS WITH- THE COUNCIL AND ALL JUSTICE IN THE HOUSE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND THE COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENTS JUSTICE CENTER AND DSHS PARTICIPATION IN STATEWIDE COUNTY VIRGIN TRAINS POSTED BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD WARN THAT MANY TRAVELS NOT CURRENT PURCHASE NOT CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE DECISION I LET HAVE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED SOME DIVERSION PROGRAMS TARGETS MISTER LEONARD POPULATION HAS TO MORE CLIENTS TO POPULATION AND THOSE PROTOCOLS WOULD BE EXPANDED TO. INCLUDE THE. ISSUE POPULATION. WITH RESPECT TO THE- A IS THAT YOU EACH BEING ONE FORMAL EVALUATE- IF SO WHAT THE TIME. WELL THE INITIAL FUNDING ALL FOR THIS WAS FOCUSED ON. THAT DATA WORK BY STATURE- AND DID NOT INCLUDE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT FORMAL VALUATION HOWEVER OUR DATA COLLECTION DOES INCLUDE DEMOGRAPHIC AND SERVICE LEVEL DATA. WHICH WOULD BE WERE REGULARLY- ANNUAL ATHLETES AND IN ADDITION MORE MONITORING OUTCOMES TRACKING BEST PRACTICES AND DEVELOPING A COMPENDIUM THAT WILL SUMMARIZE. COUNTIES PROGRAM AND OUTLINED THE SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS USED AND CLIENTS AS WELL AS- PROVIDED A SUMMARY THE CLIENT SERVICES- AS OF OUR BUDGET REQUEST. INCLUDED ADDITIONAL RESEARCH FUNDING TO CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS AND SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION. AND THEN LASTLY I WANTED TO ADDRESS- THE LAST QUESTION WHICH WAS PLEASE DESCRIBE HOW DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT USE YES EACH INCLUDES THE S. ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THE HOMELESS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS. AND WAIT TO COMPLETION OF SERVICES AND REPLENISHING SECTIONS I HAVE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS- I THINK THE BIGGEST FEAR IS A DEVELOPING JOINT TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOCUSING ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PARTICULARLY AROUND- WORKING WITH THE- JUSTICE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS ONE A GREAT EXAMPLE. OF THIS IS- LAST YEAR PARTNER WITH OUR DEPARTMENT HELP CARE SIR CENTER C. H. D. A AS WELL AS THE HEALTH WANTS TO FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO DEVELOP TRAINING COUNCIL STAFF. AND FOCUSED ON THIS MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTIONS- AND NOW THAT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND REALLY TARGETED DIRECT LINE STAFF AND SUPERVISORS WHO ARE ALL WORKING WITH THIS POPULATION FELT. THAT DIVERSION AND WORKING WITH COUNTY LEARN THAT THERE WAS A NEED IN ACROSS. FOR LEARNING ABOUT WORKING WITH THIS OP AND SO- NOT ONLY IS YOUR DIVERSION BUT ARE USED SEE DEEP SEA PROGRAM ALWAYS. CHEERS G. MORE. SPACE AND- CONTINUE SHOOT PARTNER OUR OUR SISTER AGENCY. ON ALL THEIR. ADDITIONALLY OUR SAY THAT COUNTIES PARTICIPATE IN THE C. D. P. THEY'RE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO. A WRITTEN PLAN BACK ADDRESS HOW THE TO LET OTHER FUNDS PROPERTY. AND STANDS OUR EXISTING. JUNE TRY THIS- AND- SO THAT MADE- SOME OF THE OTHER. SENDING YOUR MARK WILL BE A BIG ROLE FOR INCREASING THAT CAPACITY IN THE PEOPLE WATCHING ONE. IN ADDITION- WE ARE CURRENTLY MEETING REGULARLY- DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS WELL AS SOCIAL SERVICES ALONG WITH OUR AGENCY DEPUTY DEPUTY SECRETARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- TO COORDINATE EFFORTS AROUND INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSALS AND THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WERE. MADE AVAILABLE TO. SO LET'S NOT RIGHT WILL OPEN IT UP AND OR NEED TO RETURN PRESENTER. THANK YOU VERY NEXT WE'LL HEAR THE OF HOW CARE SIR. RIGHT GIVEN THE LATE HOUR I WILL TRY TO KEEP IT BRIEF BUT OF COURSE OPEN TO QUESTIONS AT THE END WHEN THE PANELISTS ARE DONE. SO AS YOU CAN CLEARLY HEARD ON THE HEARING TODAY- UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE HAVE. BEEN LOOKING INTO AS STATISTICS IN REGARDS TO NEEDED ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WE CURRENTLY ARE INDICATING THAT WE HAVE. WITH INPATIENT INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BED CAPACITY IS ABOUT TWENTY ONE BEDS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND EXPERTS ESTIMATE THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE PROBABLY NEED A FIFTY R. YEP FIFTY TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IS NEEDED I'M IN CALIFORNIA. WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVEN Q. A MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT BEDS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A NUMBER OF DRIVERS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT MISMATCH OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND- ON THAT SIDE I THINK THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA FACES A REAL ESTATE COSTS LEADING TO CHALLENGES OF BUILDING NEW FACILITIES- THERE HAS BEEN HISTORICAL NOT IN MY BACKYARD MENTALITY AND ZONING RESTRICTIONS. A DIFFICULT. ASSESSING FOR ACCESSING LOW INCOME HOUSING AVAILABLE- ADDITIONALLY THE RESTRICTIONS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGARDS TO YOU- SERVICES IN INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE OR I AM DIS. AND THEN LASTLY COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT PROVIDING COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN COUNTY CONTRACTED PROVIDERS FROM BUILDING FINANCIAL RESERVES THAT COULD OTHERWISE ALLOW FOR SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SEE- BUT YOU KNOW A CLEAR NEED- FROM THE CONVERSATIONS TODAY AND RESEARCH OF WHAT'S NEEDED IN THE COMMUNITY. TO REALLY INCREASE THE COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT RESOURCES AS WELL AS MAXIMIZING THE AVAILABLE REAL ESTATE IN LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PUTS FORWARD A PROPOSAL FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OVER A THREE YEAR- EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY. TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO COUNTIES AND TRIBES TO ACQUIRE- AND REHABILITATE REAL ESTATE ASSETS IT'S TO EXPAND THE COMMUNITY YOU CAN TO I'M A BEHAVIOR TREAT RESOURCE AND CAL. DO YOU SEE BELIEVE WE COULD INCREASE CAPACITY OF UP TO FIVE THOUSAND BEDS WITH THESE FUNDS WHICH WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SERVICES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. FURTHERMORE IT WILL OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES THIS CALIFORNIA WORKS ON ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER ASK WITH CMS ON THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR R&amp;D STAYS. ARE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT DH CS IS AND THE ARE COUNTY PARTNERS ARE VERY COMMITTED. TO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE FULL CONTINUUM OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA A LOT FOR ALL STEP DOWN IN DIVERSION SERVICES IS A TO ENSURE PEOPLE ARE GETTING SERVICES AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE- AND THAT WHEN THEY AREN'T AND I AM D. THAT THEY HAVE THOSE APPROPRIATE LOWER LEVEL COMMUNITY SERVICES TO TRANSITION TO. A DCS ANTICIPATES THAT HAVING OF THE APPLICATION UP AND RUNNING BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WE WILL REQUIRE APPLICANTS TO PROVIDE A 20% LOCAL MATCH- INCLUDED IN OPERATING BUDGET AN ONGOING SOURCE THE FUNDS. AS WELL AS COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS DEDICATION- DEDICATED USE FOR THIRTY YEARS R. DH CS HAS HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE SACK AND CVH DA AND WE WILL WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM ON FLEXIBILITIES WITHOUT LOCAL MATCH. WE DO THINK THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE AN HSA FUNDS COUNTY GENERAL FUND AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF PROPERTY OR LAND WE WANT TO BE FLEXIBLE WITH THEM- TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MOVING THE NEEDLE IN THIS SPACE AND MAXIMIZING. THESE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY D. CS OF PLANS YOU CAN A- GAS ANALYSIS IN THE FALL OF TWENTY ONE A TWO AND- OUR APPLE. PROCESS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE ARE CURRENT GAPS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE FULL CONTINUUM A TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE STRATEGICALLY. CLOSING THOSE GAPS AS WE START TO FUND PROJECTS- IN THE SCORING OF OUR APPLICATIONS WOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. WE WOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO COUNTIES THAT ARE SLIGHTLY SMALLER AND NEED THAT TYPE OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITY. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT THE COUNTIES. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL. I LSO WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT YOU KNOW BUT BASED ON OUR LAST SPEAKER THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS BUT SPECIFICALLY AS YOU HEARD SOME STATISTICS EARLIER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF. STATE HOSPITALS YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT- HAD NOT OF THOSE AN ICED TEAS- I HAD NOT ACCESS COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SERVICES- IN THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR ARREST IN NEARLY 50% OF THE EYES TEETH. WERE UNSHELTERED HOMELESS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARREST- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO- WHAT WERE BEEN HEARING TO THIS HEARING THOSE STATISTICS ALONE- YOU KNOW BUILDING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY BASED. BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESS SERVICES IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL- IN WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL THERE ARE SOME THINGS WITHIN CAL AIM THAT WE THINK WE SHOULD HIGHLIGHT. IN REGARDS TO BEING ABLE TO MOVE THAT NEEDLE IN ADDITION TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL- PUT FORWARD FOR CONSIDERATION. SO THERE'S TWO PIECES WITHIN CAL AIMED I WILL GET YOU OTHER KIND OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH KELLY PROPOSALS IN ISSUE FIVE BUT- RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES. AND SOME OF OUR JUSTICE INVOLVED PIECES I JUST TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE AND TALENT FOR THIS HIGH NEED POPULATION. SO THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IS MEANT TO BE A COMMUNITY BASED INTENSIVE BENEFIT- THAT ALLOWS FOR ON THE GROUND- INTENSIVE SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSED TARGET POPULATIONS THE ONES THAT ARE MOST PERTINENT TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY INCLUDE CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS- INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS OR WHO ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR INSTITUTIONALIZATION WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS CHILDREN WITH EACH YEAR IS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WITH CO OCCURRING CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS- AND LASTLY. INDIVIDUALS TRANSITIONING FROM INCARCERATION AND YOU HAVE TO. COM IS OR BE HEALTH NEEDS I REQUEST. IT TRANSITION SERVICES INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO THOSE ARE THREE OF OUR MAIN TARGET POPULATIONS FOR ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT. I'M THERE ARE SOME WHAT WE'RE CALLING IN LIEU OF SERVICES PROPOSED IN CALAIS AND- WHICH ESSENTIALLY SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES THAT CAN BE OFFERED TO A BENEFICIARY CAN MEET CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. IN LIEU OF HIGHER COST SERVICES INPATIENT STAYS EMERGENCY ROOM XTERRA. UP AND THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT WE THINK WOULD GREATLY IMPACT OF THE POPULATION BEING DISCUSSED TODAY I'M INCLUDING HOUSING TRANSITION NAVIGATION SERVICES DEPOSITS. TENDENCY ASSISTING SERVICES SHORT TERM POST HOSPITALIZATION HOUSING WHICH WOULD INCLUDE TRANSITIONS OUT OF INSTITUTIONS- INCLUDING BOTH AS- INCARCERATION AS WELL AS I. N. D.'S. RECUPERATIVE CARE- AS WELL AS THEY HAVE DILATATION PROGRAMS AND SOBERING CENTERS. ARE GIVEN YOU KNOW THE CONVERSATION HAVE AROUND HOMELESSNESS POPULATION I'M LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE AROUND HOW THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- SERVICES WOULD BENEFIT US SOMEONE IN THAT POPULATION- SO SAY YOU HAVE A HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL WHO IS- BEEN ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. SOMETIMES THE IN CURRENT STATE SOMEONE COULD STAY HOSPITALIZED FOR. UP TO SIX. IBM MONTHS OFTEN SOMETIMES A VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME YOU SEEN IN CERTAIN PARTS OF STATES WORKING WITH OUR PUBLIC- OUR OUR HOSPITAL COLLEAGUES- BUT LONG LENGTH OF STAY. THIS WOULD ALLOW SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO TRANSITION OUT TO RECRUITMENT OF CARE SERVICES. AND BE ABLE TO RECEIVE MEDICAL SERVICES. LIMITED MEDICAL SERVICES WHILE THEY TRANSITION WHILE LINKING THEM UP THROUGH ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT TO VARIOUS HOUSING NAVIGATION SERVICES. ALLOWING FOR THAT APPROPRIATE STEP DOWN WHILE ALSO IDENTIFYING ANY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY MAY. NEED AND GET THEM INTO THOSE NEED TO IT'S- SO REALLY THINKING THE WHOLE COMPLY CAN TO. ALSO WITH IN CALAIS IN- THEY IS A FOCUS A JUSTICE. FOR EXAMPLE PROPOSES A THIRTY DAY IN RE TRUST SOMEBODY IS INCARCERATED TO START THE TRANSITION SMOOTHLY BEFORE THAT INDIVIDUAL IS RELEASED FROM JAIL IT ALSO- PROPOSES MANDATORY ENROLLMENT IN MEDI CAL MEDICARE AND MEDI CAL A PRIOR TO RELEASE WITH WARM HANDOFFS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WHETHER THAT BE THE COUNTY. OR THE MINUTE OF THE MANAGED CARE PLAN DEPENDING ON THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED- ALSO WITHIN CALAIS MORE ALLOWING SUBSTANCE USE HISTORY OF PRIOR TO INCARCERATION TO MAKE SOMEONE ELIGIBLE FOR TREATMENT UPON RELEASE AND MANY OF THE- ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT I MENTIONED WITH THE TARGET POPULATION BUT ALSO GREATLY BENEFIT JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS COORDINATING CARE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING WHAT THEY NEED. I THINK TELLING BILLS WE ARE VERY MUCH SO ON THE NECESSARY KIND OF POLICY AND BENEFITS NEEDED TO CREATE THE WILL CONTINUE- AND INCREASE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES- ENSURING THAT APPROPRIATE TRANSITIONS ARE TAKING PLACE BUT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVERSION AND THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING- AND DRIVING THROUGH SOME OF THOSE SOCIAL FACTORS THAT ARE OFTEN- HINDERING SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO. BECOME HEALTHIER- AND OR TO SEEK TREATMENT AND SERVICES I DO USE THE F. DOES PLAN ON COVERING BEHAVIORAL KELLY MY VIRGINITY IS AN ISSUE FIVE SO I WON'T DUPLICATE- OUR COMMENTS THERE- AND- BUT WILL YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON A FEW OF THE OTHER PIECES I THINK WE ALSO ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN AND YOUTH- AND FAMILIES SERVING FOSTER SYSTEM- ARE RECEIVING AT ALL SERVICES THAT THEY ARE NEEDED WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IMPROVING ACCESS TO PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN COORDINATING CLOSELY WITH OUR SOCIAL SERVICE COLLEAGUES- IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT AT IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE S. LAW A FOSTER Mà OF CARE WORKERS TWO X. THIS VERY THING INCOME UP WITH A LONG TERM PLAN. FOR HOW WE CAN IMPROVE. OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER CHILDREN AND YOUTH I'M AND HOW WE CAN BETTER PROVIDE PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OR ON SOCIAL SERVICES- AND THAT WORK GROUP WILL CONTINUE TO MEET YOUR JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M SO THIS WOULD BE THE END OF MY COMMENTS TO LOOK FOR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DR EWING. THANK YOU HI I'M DOCTOR DANIEL. SO I THINK YOU KNOW IN THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONVERSATION. I WANT TO A LITTLE BIT OF THE HISTORY. CALIFORNIA IS FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM. THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM ACTUALLY PREDATES THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND WAS- PIONEERED THE N. LONG BEACH CALIFORNIA AND THEN WAS SUPPORTED WITH SOME HIGH THAT LEGISLATION THAT WAS AUTHORED BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DARRELL STEINBERG- CALIFORNIA'S FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE OUR- OUR MENTAL HEALTH CLIENTS WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS. AND THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM WAS TO WOULD SERVE THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS JAIL OR PRISON INVOLVEMENT AND HOSPITALIZATION. AND THE ACTUAL ORIGIN IN TELLING CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZED THAT AT THE TIME LOS ANGELES COUNTY WAS PLACING MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS IN A STATE HOSPITAL. AND A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION APPROACH THE COUNTY AND ARGUED THAT WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO DELIVER CARE IN A WHATEVER IT TAKES APPROACH. THAT THEY COULD SERVE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY RATHER THAN IN A LOCKED INSTITUTION. AND BY SERVING THEM AND THE COMMUNITY THEY COULD DRIVE DOWN FEDERAL FUNDING AND OTHER FUNDING STREAMS. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT EVERYBODY WHO IS SERVED IN A ESTATE HOSPITAL CAN BE SERVED IN THE COMMUNITY. AND I DO WANT TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT. THAT YEAH I MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY TESTIMONY THAT WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD OUT AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAM. IN PART OF OUR EFFORT IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW CAN WE DESIGN COMMUNITY BASED CARE INSTITUTIONAL BASED CARE. AND A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP ACTUALLY PROVIDES. A CONTEXT FOR SAYING CAN WE INTERVENE. MUCH EARLIER AGAIN B. M. DEVELOPMENT OF SOMEONE'S MENTAL ILLNESS SO THE DATA THAT TALK ABOUT HIGH NOT HIGH NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE RECEIVING SIR- WORK. INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT WEREN'T NECESSARILY RECEIVING SERVICES THEN ALTERNATELY BEING CHARGED WITH A FELONY CRIME AND AS A RESULT OF BEING DECLARED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND BEING DIRECTED INTO A STATE HOSPITAL PROGRAM. THE COMMISSION IS ACTUALLY USING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE RECEIVED TWO YEARS AGO WE'VE LAUNCHED SEVERAL PROJECTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. NEEDING THAT HIGHEST LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL BASED CARE BY WORKING UPSTREAM SO WE ARE DEVELOPING PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES MODEL AFTER ADVANCE DIRECTIVES THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN THE MEDICAL FIELD WHERE ARE FRESNO COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY IN A COUPLE OF OTHER COUNTIES. ARE VERY INTERESTED AND THEY'RE THEY'RE DEDICATING COUNTY INNOVATION FINDS THEIR MATCHING FUNDS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. FROM THE FIVE NINE DOLLARS THAT WE ORIGINALLY ALLOCATED TWO YEARS AGO. WE ARE WORKING WITH I THINK IT IS- TWELVE COUNTIES TO HELP THEM DO THE SAME KIND OF DATA MATCH THAT THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITAL HAS DONE. TO LOOK AT CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND UNDERSTAND HOW CAN WE BETTER DELIVER COMMUNITY BASED CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK OF. STATE HOSPITALIZATION OR AGAIN JAIL INVOLVEMENT OR HOMELESSNESS. RIGHT THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES RECOGNIZING THE INCREASED PRESSURE THAT WE'RE SEEING ON STATE HOSPITALS. I'M THE COMMISSION IS VERY INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING HOW WE MIGHT FORTIFY THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN THESE PREVENTION STRATEGIES. HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT WE CAN SERVE PEOPLE VERY EARLY AND THE ONSET OF PSYCHOSIS SO THAT THEIR NEEDS DON'T ESCALATE TO THE POINT. THAT THEY ARE ARRESTED FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE TIMES FOR MISDEMEANORS AND THEN HAVE A FELONY CHARGE AND BECOME INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. HOW CAN WE STRENGTHEN THE FOR THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP MODEL. AND I WOULD COMMENT THAT IT'S CALLED A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP MODEL. THE WORD PARTNER REFERS TO THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION OR THE COUNTY THAT IS DELIVERING CARE AND IT'S FULL SERVICE BECAUSE THE FLEXIBILITY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FARMS ALLOWS THE PROVIDER TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THAT PERSON HAS THE CARE AND THE SUPPORT NECESSARY SO THAT THEY AREN'T HOMELESS AREN'T INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND AREN'T INVOLVED WITH- ESTATE HOSPITALS OR OR EVEN COMMUNITY HOSPITALS. THAT COMMENT IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE. THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WAS FOUND TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN THE INITIAL EVALUATIONS THAT WERE CONDUCTED. AS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WAS ACTUALLY BEING DRAFTED. THAT THE AXE THAT STIPULATES THAT COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO SPEND AT LEAST HALF OF THEIR COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORT FUNDS ON FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. AND AS INDICATED IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT'S RUNNING AROUND NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THE REASON I MENTION THIS IS BECAUSE THAT IS YEAH. AMONG IF NOT THE LARGEST INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMATIC INVESTMENT THAT WE MAKE. IT MEANS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. IF THE STATE CAN SUPPORT IT BILLION COUNTIES TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS HOW WE MIGHT STRENGTHEN THOSE INVESTMENTS AND HOW WE MIGHT FIND WAYS TO EXPAND OF THOSE INVESTMENTS. AS AN EXPLICIT STRATEGY TO TAKE PRESSURE OFF OF OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON INSTITUTIONAL CARE RATHER THAN EXPAND RELIANCE ON INSTITUTIONAL CARE. YEAH AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WE'VE NOT NECESSARILY MADE THE RIGHT KIND OF INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTIES. TO EXPLORE HOW THAT CAN WORK THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE. BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHO IS DEVELOPING PSYCHOSIS AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE DELIVERING CARE AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. I'M ON AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AS THEY'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP OUT THERE EARLY SIZED PSYCHOSIS PROGRAM AND THEY'RE EXPLICITLY TO FRACKING BASED ON PREVALENCE RATES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO RESEARCH SUGGESTS WILL DEVELOP A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER. IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COME IN FOR SERVICES AND THEN ARE WORKING VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO SEE IF THEY CAN IDENTIFY THE STATE WHO ARE NOT ACCESSING CARE WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF ON SET OF. A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER. WE'RE BEGINNING TO TRACK. WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER ARE ACCESSING FOSTERS PARTNERSHIPS SERVICES WE'RE ALSO BEGINNING TO TRACK THE IMPACT OF. RECEIVING SERVICES THAT THESE PROGRAMS AND WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU THAT AS MUCH AS SIXTY NINE THERE'S A IS MUCH OF THE 69% REDUCTION. IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. ALL WHO ARE SERVED BY A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP SO WE THINK THIS STRATEGY OF DELIVERING MORE COMMUNITY BASED CARE. WRAPAROUND CARE CARE THAT IS TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT IT THAT SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO MOVE UPSTREAM. IS THE WAY THAT WE CAN AFFORDABLE THEY REDUCE RELIANCE ON VERY EXPENSIVE VERY DIFFICULT. INSTITUTIONAL KINDS OF SETTINGS NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN TAKE PEOPLE TODAY OUT OF INSTITUTIONS BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SO THAT OVER TIME WE'RE LESS RELIANT. ON STATE HOSPITAL BEDS WERE LESS RELIANT ON THESE CRISIS SERVICES AND ARGUABLY WERE EVEN LESS RESIGN RELIANT ON FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION A FAR BETTER THAN WE'RE DOING TODAY. THE M. AND I MENTIONED THE MONEY AGAIN BECAUSE GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN FOR SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF THOSE INVESTMENTS AND HOW WE MIGHT LEVERAGE THAT. MAXIMIZING FEDERAL DRIVE DOWN FOR EXAMPLE I'M- ALSO PROVIDING THE RIGHT KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND SUPPORT TO OUR COUNTY PARTNERS SO WE CAN MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THE BIGGEST. BANG FOR THE BUCK THAT IS POSSIBLE. THE QUESTION IF YOU HAVE THEM THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DR KELLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR ARAMBULA SO THAT THEY CAN BE A HEALTH SAFETY NET REALLY SPECIALIZES IN WORKING WITH OUR HIGH NEEDS POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED IN THIS PANEL ON HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WITH A SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED AND CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH HIGH ACUITY A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES WE WORK REALLY WELL WITH THESE POPULATIONS BECAUSE WE TAKE A SYSTEMS APPROACH A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL APPROACH TO CARE. AND WE'RE ABLE TO BRAID OR MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS TO DO A SORT OF OUT REACH MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE AT WE PAY FOR LOCKED IN OTHER TREATMENT SERVICES WHICH ALL TOO OFTEN FALL OUTSIDE OF THE ROUNDOF REGULAR HEALTH CARE INSURANCE COVERAGE INCLUDING. THOSE THINGS THAT ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE. THE SILO FUNDING STREAMS CAN ALSO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND POLICY MAKERS TO GET THE FULL PICTURE OF OUR RANGE OF SERVICES- AND TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE ACTUAL GAPS EXIST IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WITH THE BROADER HOMELESS POPULATION SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 2225% OF INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAVE A SERIOUS RELATIVELY SMALL BUT AN ACUTE PORTION OF THE BROADER POPULATION SAME FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RATES ARE CLOSER HUD- ESTIMATES AND WHEN I FOUND MYSELF IN WORKING WITH THIS POPULATION OF CLIENTS FOR THE PAST TWENTY NINE YEARS IS THAT MANY OF OUR- OUR CLIENTS DEVELOP BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AS A RESULT. OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND HOW LONG PERIODS OF LIVING ON THE STREETS CAN EXPOSE INDIVIDUALS TO MULTIPLE LAYERS OF TRAUMAS AND THE EXPERIENCE OF LIVING WITH THE STIGMA AND BIAS THAT ALSO COMES ALONG WITH A HERO CAL HEALTH CONDITIONS CAN ABSOLUTELY MAKE OUR CLIENTS MORE VULNERABLE TO EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. I LIKE TO JUST SHARE SOME OF OUR SUCCESSES IN WORKING WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE POPULATION AS WELL AS OUR HOMELESS POPULATION HERE IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY AS IN MANY OF OUR FTA COUNTIES- WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF CARE FOR HOMELESS POPULATION. IN SAMBAR DINO WE ROLL WITH OUR SHERIFF'S HOMELESS POLICING GROUP THAT MEANS WE DEPLOY IT SIDE BY SIDE WE SHARE THE AREAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO USUALLY AND- ARE. OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ESERT OR UNDER FREEWAY EMBANKMENTS WE SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS. AT BY DOING CASE MANAGEMENT WE HAVE BEEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAVE BEEN THE SOLE SUPPORT. FROM CASE MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO WERE LIVING IN QUARANTINE AND ARE COPING TRAILERS THAT CAME FROM THE GOVERNOR FOR FOLKS WHO ARE COVERED POSITIVE AND- NO PLACE ELSE TO GO- WE HAVE PROVIDED CASE MANAGEMENT FOR ALL OF OUR- ROOM KEY OPERATION ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY PROJECTS. AND WE ARE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE. HAD AN MHSAA. INNOVATION PROJECT CALLED INROADS FOR INNOVATIVE REMOTE. ONSIDE ONSITE ACCESS AND DELIVERY OF SERVICES WHICH IS A MOBILE UNIT THAT GOES INTO OUR A REMOTE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS THAT BRINGS TO THE UNIT OUR TO THE- HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT A CLINICIAN AND ALCOHOL AND DRUG COUNSELOR WE HAVE A NURSE PRACTITIONER FROM PUBLIC HEALTH. WE HAVE A STAFF MEMBER FROM AGING AND ADULT SERVICES A WE ALSO PAY FOR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SHERIFF DEPUTIES TO DEPLOY WITH US AND THE KEY THAT WE FOUND. VETERINARY CARE SERVICES SO THAT WE CAN. MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE AND INCREASE TRUST WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING- OUTING COMMUNITY WITHOUT HOME WE CAN DO VISITS AND GET THEM READY TO BE HOUSE BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS YOU CAN'T JUST LIKE SOMEONE OUT OF THE STREETS HE'S BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND PLACE THEM IN A LOCKED HOME ARE LOCKED A HOTEL ROOM AND EXPECT THEM TO STAY. SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO ALL OF THAT FROM OUR SUCCESSES WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP AGAIN MANY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORK HAND IN HAND WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS AND SAN BENITO COUNTY. I SAID ON OUR LINE JUSTICE GROUP WITH OUR SHARE OF OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY A PUBLIC DEFENDER ARE SECURE COURT JUDGES ARE PROBATION CHIEF. AND MANY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WHICH I THINK REALLY SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIP AND RELATIONSHIP. WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER WE DO JAIL RE ENTRY FOR OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND AGAIN THANKS TO THE MHSAA ARE THANKS TO YOU OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION DIRECTOR EWING WE HAVE USED SP NINE ACE SB EIGHTY TWO GRANTS TO CREATE A TRIAGE. GROUP WE CALL IT TRIAGE ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT TEAM OR TEST THEIR COLOCATED. WITHIN. FORTY EIGHT DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT. A JURISDICTION AND SHE SUBS. AND THEY DO COMMUNITY POLICE. AND THE SAME SENSE OF WORK WITH ON FOUR MEANT TO. I CRISIS CALL DIRECT RACES WE- TEAM I CAN FUNDED TO MHS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE SO THAT WE REALLY BUILT THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY COUNTY OF FUNDED AND OPERATED FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT DIRECTOR EWING WAS JUST DISCUSSING OUR CORE HAVE BEEN COR TO THE VISION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. THROUGHOUT THIS PIECE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE A WHATEVER IT TAKES APPROACH TO THE HIGHEST NEEDS POPULATION. WE HAVE AN FSP FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE. I AM IN THE L. A. C. DAY TEAM FOUND TO. IN OUTCOMES FOR FSP PARTICIPANTS ACROSS VARIOUS DOMAINS INCLUDING. LINKAGE TO PRIMARY CARE REDUCE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. AND WHILE PROJECT ROOM KEY HAS HOUSE MORE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THOSE HOUSING EFFORTS WERE NOT SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLIENTS SOMEONE LIVING WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS OR AN ADDICTION ON THE STREETS AND THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT AS NOT BEING. PART OF THE A PUBLIC ASSISTANCE VIA FEMA SO THAT COUNTIES HAVE TO LEVERAGE OUR OWN STAFF OUR OWN FUNDING. AGAIN WE'RE- A CASE MANAGEMENT STAFF AND CLINICIANS SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO OUR HOMELESS FOLKS. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT TE COUNTIES HAVE TO PULL THEIR STAFF WHO ARE ABLE TO BILL FOR MEDICAL SERVICES AND THEN PLACE THEM OUT TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT ALBEIT NOT WELL FUNDED- SERVICE DELIVERY. HOUSING MORE INDIVIDUALS IS GOOD FOR THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND OUR COMMUNITIES AT LARGE. THE PROJECT ROOM KEY WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY MORE INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE IN NEED OF COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO SERVE THOSE FOLKS ARE SERVICE. PROVIDERS OVERALL HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED BY COBIT OUTBREAKS OFTEN DRIVEN MORE BY STAFF AND CLIENTS AND BECAUSE OUR TREATMENT PROVIDERS ARE OFTEN CONGREGATE IN RESIDENTIAL IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING AT TIMES TO DEAL WITH THE WAVES OF. TEMPORARY CLOSURES AND RESTRICTIONS ON CAPACITY THAT HAVE COME WITH OPEN FOR ALL OF OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING THE STATE HOSPITALS AND OUR JAIL SYSTEM. AT THE SAME TIME A FELONY- ICED TEA WAITLIST HAS ALMOST DOUBLED AS YOU HEARD FROM- DISH SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF THE STATE HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE LESS. LOCAL CAPACITY TO SERVE HIGH NEEDS POPULATIONS NOT MORE WHICH IS ALSO DUE TO COVERAGE. THANK YOU. WE HAVE MICHELLE STE SEE IF YOU CAN MATCH. THANK YOU CARAMBOLA I'M GOING TO SAY GOOD EVENING. I'M GONNA SPEAK A LITTLE BIT- WHAT MEDIC CAL AND MHS WHAT IS WORKING ABOUT MEDIC COLLIN AND BECAUSE THEY FUNDING AND WHAT IS NOT FOR THE POPULATION- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT CONTEXT AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FITS WITHIN MEDICARE HEALTH FUNDING AND WHAT DOES THAT- FOR OUR MEDIC HEALTH BENEFICIARY EVEN WITHIN OUR HOMELESS POPULATION OUR MEMBERS. NEED TO DO INTENSE OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT- EVEN START MEDIC HEALTH SERVICES SO FOR EXAMPLE TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF OUR INVESTMENT WITH CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AT CLIENTS WHO HAVE SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS IT CAN TAKE MONTHS SOMETIMES EVEN YEARS TO BUILD TRUST OVER TIME WITH THAT PERSON AND GET THEM TO ENGAGE IN MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE. TREATMENT SERVICES- IT CAN TAKE A TYPICAL OUTREACH WORKER ANYWHERE BETWEEN FORTY TO FIFTY CONTACT BEFORE THEY WILL ENGAGE IN SERVICES AND NONE OF THAT IS MEDIC HOW BILLABLE WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE NEED TO BE A WIDER RANGE OF HOUSING AS WELL AS TREATMENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE- HIGH NEED POPULATIONS THAT WERE SERVING AND FOR EXAMPLE HELPING IS NOT COVERED UNDER MEDICARE ALTHOUGH WE NEED TO FIND. OUT AND OTHER FUNDING SOURCES FOR THAT OUTSIDE OF MEDICARE HOW- AND HSA FUNDS HAVE BEEN LEVERAGED TO A LARGE DEGREE FOR OUR HOUSING SERVICES AND THEN WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT OUR- INSTITUTE OF MENTAL DISEASE R. I AM D. EXCLUSION WHICH IS REALLY SORT OF AT THE QUARRY HERE AGAIN WHETHER A PERSON IS ON MEDIC HOW OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER IT IS. THE PLACEMENT AVAILABILITY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC IS THAT OUR GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL CAPACITY HAS BEEN LIMITED BY THE PANDEMIC AND SOMETIMES ARE COUNTY YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO TURN TO OTHER THAN OUR. I AND D. FACILITIES FOR THAT LET BY OF. WE HAVE ONE WHERE THERE ARE USE CHU KEEP CARE- WHICH TOOK THEIR PEACE PSYCHIATRIC CLIENT. NEEDED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND RESTRICT ACCESS TO COPE IT AND WHEN WHERE THEY USUALLY SPENT AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR ON MEDICAL MEDIKAL BILLABLE IMPATIENT BECAUSE- WHEN THEY WERE FORCED TO TURN TO A LOCAL I. M. B. PROVIDERS. THOSE COSTS. BY ROCKETED TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS. ANOTHER COUNTY IF AYE INDYCAR ROSE BY 40% NONE OF THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS WERE. PROVIDED ANY KIND OF SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICE BUSINESSPEOPLE CHRISTINE WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT MEDIC HOW BILLABLE SERVICES TO THE POPULATION IT'S OFTEN NOT INCLUDING THE FRONT END WHICH IS THAT OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT AND PREVENTION WORK WHICH IS FUNDED UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. FOR THE BACKEND WHICH ARE THE IMDB COSTS BOTH BURKE- UNLOCKED AS WELL AS BLOCK STUDY. NOR IS IT THE HOW. ARRAY OF THIRD AND WITH THAT THE SORT OF UNIVERSAL HOUSING WHICH YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE HEARING TONIGHT IS REALLY HOUSING HOUSE- THE PROPHYLACTIC MET MEDICINAL ASPECT TO IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE POPULATION- YOU KNOW THOSE RESOURCES ARE ALSO NOT SORT OF AGNOSTIC WHEN IT COMES TO OUR- CLIENTS WHO OFTENTIMES- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE HAVING TO PAY FOR THROUGH THE MHSAA AGAIN. SERVICES TO WORK WITH LANDLORDS TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND- THE NEEDS OF OUR POPULATION TO ME TO GET THEM TO BE WILLING TO HELP OUR POPULATIONS. THERE IS A KIND OF NIMBYISM AND DISCRIMINATION WITHIN- THE HOUSING WORLD AS WELL WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR OUR CLIENT ACCESS- BROADER HOUSING INVESTMENT- WHEN IT COMES EVEN TO TREATMENT PROVIDERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATION- IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PLACE CLIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF OUR- FACT THE FENCES OR OTHER VIOLENT BEHAVIOR. AND WE REALLY DO NEED TO BUILD OUT A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM OF CARE IF WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT COUNTIES TO TAKE ON A BROADER SEGMENT OF- BE INJUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATION- WE CAN PROVIDE SPECIALIZED TRAINING WE CAN BUILD OUT THAT EXTRA CAPACITY. BUT. TO A LARGE DEGREE FOR THE VOLUME OF- INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD BE ASKED SERVE. THAT GOAL OR OF. ORIENTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE NOT A TODAY AGAIN ON A SCALE- SO THOSE ARE OF THE HE- THAT WE'RE LOOKING IN TERMS OF OUR EXISTING CAPACITY TO THINK. INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL IS FAIRLY WELL TIMED- AND WILL GO A LONG WAY TO- STARTING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE SYSTEMIC ISSUES IN THE MID TO LONG TERM BUT IT HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH. TO BE TAILORED TO THE REGIONAL LOCAL NEEDS AND GAPS IN THE IN THIS CAPACITY- THERE IS A SMALL POT OF FUNDING WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. BUT IT COMPETES WITH FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE AS WELL AS THE EIGHTEEN WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND IT HAS TO BE DIVERTED AWAY FROM THOSE CORE FSP TYPE SERVICES THAT WE WERE JUST SPEAKING TO- IF WE'RE GOING TO APPLY IT AND SO- COUNTIES HAVE BEEN NAVIGATING ALL OF THESE SORT OF. CATEGORICAL RESTRICTIONS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE THAT FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES- WITH RESPECT TO THE MATCH THAT'S BEING PROPOSED FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING I MUST POINT OUT A BILL COMPELLED TO POINT OUT CHAIR OF I'M GLAD. THAT ME HAVE STRUGGLE TO FIND ANY OTHER AREA WHERE- EARMARKED FUNDING IS SO FREQUENTLY- AND BE COLLECTED A MATCH AS FUNDS WHICH ARE DIRECTED AT THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. EVEN A LOCAL HOUSING INITIATIVE- YOU KNOW THERE'S SORT OF. A MATCH REQUESTED BUT NOT REQUIRED THE SAME WAY THAT IT IS WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WE WOULD REALLY ASK FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT APPARENTLY THERE- TWENTY THIRD CERTAINLY GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE SERVICES THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. AYE TUN CAN MAKE THESE PROJECTS WHERE- AND HELP ALREADY IN. SO MUCH OUT OF MY CAL WE THAT THAT HIS OF AND THAT HISTORIC IT MAKE TO BE CLEANED- DID YOU TO WHICH VERY NO COMPREHEND AND COMMON SET OF INFORMATION ALSO ACROSS THE VARIOUS SAFETY NET PLAYER PAYER. AND SERVICES IN THE FRUSTRATION WE UNDERSTAND IT AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THE STATE DEVELOP A COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STATE WIDE OUT CONTENT PER FORM ANCE MEASURE- INITIATIVE WHICH WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR OFFERING CARE ITEM BLOCKS- AS WETHINK THAT THIS WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE BROADER DATA WORK WHICH- WHICH ISN'T. SO IMPORTANT HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE L. A- COREY HOW SHE'D. THANK YOU DR KOREAN SHEET AGAIN WITH THE L. A. L. I'LL BE GIVING COMMENTS ON ON THREE OF THE ITEMS THAT THAT WERE UP FOR DISCUSSION IN THIS PANEL FIRST- THE STATE HOSPITALS CCD P. DECK. THE NEXT THE DH CS COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL AND THEN- ALSO BEGINNING SOME COMMENTS ON SOME OF THE MEDICARE PROPOSAL SAYING IN CALENDA DRESS THE NEEDS OF THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION- WE PUBLISHED ANALYSES OF THESE PROPOSALS ON OUR ON OUR WEBSITE AND- IN ADDITION FOR CALLIN WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE FORTHCOMING- THAT WILL BE- RELATING SPECIFICALLY TO EQUITY ISSUES AND CAL AIM AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW A POST FOCUSED ON ISSUES WITH THE- THE AGING POPULATION KELLY. SO I'LL JUST TOUCH ON SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS THAT WE REYES AND IN ALICE- SO FIRST FOR THE STATE HOSPITAL CCTV. I'M WE ACTUALLY ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL- HOWEVER WE DO OFFER SOME SORT OF SOME ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THE- GOALS OF THE PROPOSAL- THE CCD PA ESSENTIALLY HAS TWO GOALS ON THE FIRST IS TO MAKE. PARTICIPATING COUNTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FELONY ICY TREATMENT AND TO PROVIDE A FIXED AMOUNT- TO COUNTIES FOR THEM TO PROVIDE SORT OF THE COMPETENCY RESTORATION TREATMENT OF FELONY ISD'S. THIS IS. MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO COUNTY SO THAT THEY CAN INVEST IN COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RESOURCES TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE ON THE FRONT END- SORT OF BEFORE THEY EVEN REACHED THE POINT WHERE I'M THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY WOULD BE DECLARED. INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL- SO THAT THE RATE AT WHICH PEOPLE ARE FOUND TO BE I. ESTY DECREASES- BUT WHILE WE DON'T RAISE ISSUES WITH THESE OVERALL GOALS WE FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT WELL STRUCTURED TO ACHIEVE- SPECIFICALLY THE GOAL ABOUT CATCHING PEOPLE ON ON THE FRONT END BEFORE THEY- ARE DECLARED. S. T. FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE FUNDING MECHANISM OF THIS PROPOSAL MAKES WHETHER OR NOT- THERE WILL BE AVAILABLE FUNDS FOR COUNTIES TO INVEST IN THESE COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH- SERVICES. ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AND- WE ALSO FIND THAT THE INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM ARE ARE ARE ARE UNCLEAR- GIVEN THESE CONCERNS- WE ARE RECOMMENDING REJECTION OF THE PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD DIRECTING FUNDING- TOWARDS EXISTING STATE HOSPITALS PROGRAMS FOR FELONY ICY TREATMENT. I'M SURE THE LEGISLATURE WISH TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE- IN IN IN IN SOME. STRATEGIES FOR SORT OF CATCHING INDIVIDUALS ON THE FRONT END BEFORE THEY SORT OF REACHED THE POINT OF BEING FOUND I. S. T. THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION. ON THIS PANEL ABOUT SORT OF COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE HOSPITALS IN INDIA H. THE GAS AND- COUNTIES WITH THEIR AT THIS P. PROGRAMS AND WE FIND THAT THIS THIS COORDINATION AND SORT OF- WORKING THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO SORT OF- TARGET. WHAT'S OUT THERE AND WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET THAT MORE DIRECTLY PERTAINS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR THIS SPECIFIC POPULATION THE FOLKS THAT ARE SORT OF- AT PARTICULAR RISK OF BEING DECLARED IST- WOULD OULD SORT OF BE A MORE DIRECT WAY AT GETTING AT- YOU KNOW THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE PROPOSAL. AND WE THINK IT WOULD BE A MORE EFFICIENT AND USER- OF THE- STATE RESOURCE. I'M CERTAIN. I WILL MOVE ON TO THE- CONTINUE I'M INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL FOR DH CS- FOR THIS PROPOSAL WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANTIAL DETAILS ON THAT REMAIN UNDER DEVELOPMENT- THIS COULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT SPECIFIC MILESTONES COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO MEET- IN ORDER TO RECEIVE DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS- OR HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD BE EVALUATED- SIMILARLY TO. THE ISSUE THAT- L. A- RAISED EARLIER WITH THE STUDENT BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROPOSAL- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO INTENDS TO. RELY ON BUDGET BILL FOR THIS FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND- WE WOULD SIMILARLY SUGGESTED TRAILER BILL APPROACH THAT THE LEGISLATURE SORT OF HAS- YOU KNOW SUFFICIENT IN COURT AND SORT OF THE DESIGN OF. THE GRANT PROGRAM- REGARDING THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL WE AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE DON'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH THE CONCEPT OF. EXPANDING COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITIES AND TREATMENT CAPACITIES CERTAINLY THIS IS A VERY PRESSING- NEED ACROSS THE STATE AND- WE ALSO FIND THAT THIS THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT IS. IS LIKELY A GOOD USE OF THE STATE SIGNIFICANT ONE FALL- ONE TIME WINDFALL THAT IT HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL- WE FIND THAT THERE IS ENOUGH OVERLAP BETWEEN THIS. PROPOSED GRANT PROGRAM AND SOME PRIOR. STATE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WERE. BASICALLY FOR ME HEALTH FACILITIES- THERE WAS- MENTION OF THE SB EIGHTY TWO GRANT PROGRAM EARLIER AND- WE FIND THAT THE THAT THE OVERLAP BETWEEN THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM AND THAT SORT OF PRIOR PROGRAM- PROVIDE SOME SORT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO. APPLY LESSONS LEARNED IN DOWN REALLY AVOID SORT OF LIKE- CHALLENGES THAT CAME UP WITH SOME OF THAT THE PRIOR. PROGRAMS IN THIS AREA- WE WOULD ALSO FLAG THAT THIS PROPOSAL- AS MENTIONED ON THIS AND THIS PANEL HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER. MAJOR BUDGET PROPOSALS FIRST- YOU KNOW AT IT WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER THAT DAY CALENDAR INCLUDES A COMMITMENT TO PURSUE WHEN I AM THE WAY HER OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS FEDERAL FUNDING- FOR SORT SERVICES IN INSTITUTIONS THAT- NORMALLY MEDICAID WON'T PAY FOR- AND IN ORDER TO SORT OF GET THIS WAIVER APPROVED THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO. DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY TREATMENT OPTIONS- AND THIS PROPOSAL THAT THERE CONTINUE- YOU KNOW INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL I'M COULD HELP THE STATE SORT OF DEMONSTRATE BACK IMAGE COMMITMENT FOR ITS WAIVER OPPORTUNITY- AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO SORT OF CONSIDER WHAT IT STANDS IS ON THE- ACCOUNTING I AM THE WAIVER COMMITMENT AND SORT OF WEIGH THAT AGAINST THE- POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF. THIS PROPOSAL THAT DAY- CONTINUE. INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM. IN A- THE- AND AS AS A DISCUSS ON THIS CAN IS PRETTY THIS PROPOSAL AS- PART OF ITS OVERALL HOMELESSNESS EFFORTS AND- WELL THERE'S CERTAINLY OVERLAP BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND THOSE WITH SIGNIFICANT. HEALTH NEEDS- WE FIND THAT A TARGETING OF FUNDS TO INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WOULD BE A MORE SORT OF DIRECT WAY TO GET OUT- BE MORE SORT OF DIRECT WAY TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S OVERALL- HOMELESSNESS ISSUES. I'M AND JUSTIN ARE MOVING ON TO CAL AMEN SOME OF THE MEDIC HOW PROPOSALS IN ALLEN FOR- YOU KNOW HIGH RISK POPULATIONS AND WE JUST HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THE- ECM IN IOS- PROPOSED NEW BENEFITS AND CALAMP. ONE THING WE'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WHILE MUCH OF CALIFORNIANS NEW- MUCH OF CALLIN WOULD ALSO BUILD ON OR ON REPLACE THE EXISTING PROGRAM WHICH ALREADY SORT OF PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR- THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAM THAT'S BEING. IMPLEMENTED IN IN- SOME SELECT COUNTY STATEWIDE- YOU KNOW HOWEVER DOES NOT SORT OF JUST REFLECT A CONTINUATION OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT INSTEAD. REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STATE'S APPROACH TO FINANCING AND DELIVERING THE SERVICES THAT TODAY ARE ON PROVIDED UNDER EXISTING PROGRAMS SO FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW UNDER CARRYING SIGNIFICANT FUNDING AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION- WOULD BE CONCENTRATED SORT OF IN THE MANAGED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO- SORT OF THE DELIVERY MODELS IN WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED- WE ALSO FIND THAT CALTRAIN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING MAJOR POLICY BENEFITS. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF SUCCESSFUL THE CM IN IOS REFORMS COULD REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES BY FOCUSING RESOURCES AND ATTENTION ON MEDICARE'S HIGHEST RISK AND HIGHEST NEED BENEFICIARIES INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- THAT BEING SAID WE DO HAVE SOME. OUTSTANDING YOU KNOW CONCERNS TO RAISE ABOUT THESE COMPONENTS OF CALLIE. ON THE CONCERNS GENERALLY PERTAIN TO CALENDAR THE CALENDAR PACKAGES THE WHOLE- BUT THEY ALSO- YOU KNOW ARE ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE ECM AND I LESS BENEFITS BECAUSE THOSE ARE. THE START OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S FUNDING PLAN FOR CALLIE- FIRST YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT DETAIL ON MAJOR CALLIN COMPONENTS IS THAT'S LACKING SORT WHICH SORT OF LIMITS THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO FULLY. SCRUTINIZED THE CHANGES PROPOSALS- SECOND WE FIND THAT YOU KNOW CALTRAIN GIVEN IT SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY COMES WITH SIGNIFICANT FISCAL RISK OVER THE LONGER TERM- UNFORESEEN IMPLEMENTATION COSTS COULD MATERIALIZE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND- ANTICIPATING STATE ANTICIPATED SAVINGS MIGHT NOT MATERIALIZE QUICKLY ENOUGH OR- AT SUFFICIENT LEVELS FOR THE MULTI YEAR FUNDING PLAN TO PROVE REASONABLE. ON THESE LONG TERM FISCAL RISKS ARE ESPECIALLY RELEVANT GIVEN THE STATE BUDGET PROBLEM ANTICIPATED TO RISE AFTER. ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- WE WOULD CALL WE JUST A FEW IS FOR. ON THE MAJOR SORT OF CALUMET CAL REFORMS FIRST YOU KNOW WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE USED TO BUDGET AND POLICY PROCESS TO RESOLVE SORT OF KEY OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. AND TO PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE INPUT INTO ANY CALENDAR COMPONENTS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY ADOPTED- SECOND GIVEN THE SCOPE OF CALLIN THE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THE STATE- IS LIKELY TO FACE AS WE WILL HOPEFULLY EXIT THE PANDEMIC- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE EXPLORE WHERE WHERE DELAYS AND STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND- IMPLEMENTATION AREN'T BY THE BALL- IN THIRD TO ENSURE CALLIN IS. SORT OF ACHIEVING THE STATE'S GOALS WE RECOMMEND ESTABLISHING ROBUST RECOMMENCE. MECHANISMS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OVERSIGHT AND PROGRAM EVALUATION- SO THAT THAT SORT OF CONCLUDES L. A. O.'S COMMENTS ON THIS- ON. THIS PANEL AND- THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH- I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DíAS I WAS GOING TO USE THIS. TIME TO INFORM THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO LATER BE HEARING ABOUT CAL AIM BUT- I WILL SAVE THAT COMMENTS FOR MYSELF. I'M I WILL FOCUS ON THREE QUESTIONS FIRST I AM GOING TO- WANTS TO DISCUSS THE FELONY ISD'S. I WANT TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORICALLY WHY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MISDEMEANOR I S. T. AND A FELONY I S. T. AND WHY WE DON'T HAVE PARITY IN THAT SPACE. IS ANYONE OUT ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO. EXPLANATION JUST THAT IT IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY- THE MAN THE MISDEMEANOR I IS HE'S BEEN WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE- I COUNTIES AND THE FELONY IDEAS TO USE IN THE TREATMENT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN THE- RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE. WHY THAT IS I DON'T KNOW. THEN IN THAT LIGHT I'D LIKE TO RETURN TO TOBY EWING IF I COULD REGARDING- THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS- DURING THE DESCRIPTION OR THE RIGHT UP IT SAYS THAT THESE HEALTH SERVICES ARE FOR THE UNDERSERVED FOR- OR PREVIOUSLY UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WITH VERY HIGH NEEDS AND WITH SERIOUS AND SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS I BELIEVE THAT WOULD ENCAPSULATE THE FELONY I S. T. IS AND- WANTS TO GET YOUR UNDERSTANDING WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY'VE BEEN EXCLUDED THUS FAR FROM THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. MISTER EWING. PARDON ME I DIDN'T HAVE J. C. TO TELL ME THAT I'M YET MY- SO- SO APOLOGIES FOR THAT I'M- SO TO CLARIFY THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP IS THE COMMUNITY BASED CARE AND THE M. BECAUSE THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH A CRIME THE STATE THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND THERE ARE OTHERS HERE ON THE PANEL OF OUR EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA AND I AM ON THE DETAILS. NO THEY ARE DIRECTED TO THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS FOR TREATMENT SO THAT THEIR COMPETENCY CAN BE CAN BE RESTORED. IN CONTRAST MY COMMENTS ARE ON THE FOSTERS PARTNERSHIP IS THAT NO PRIOR. TO THE FELONY ARREST. M. AND YOU KNOW PRIOR TO MISDEMEANOR ARRESTS THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP OPTION. IS HOW WE DESIGN CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF NEED. AND WHAT IS. SHOCKING IN SOME WAYS IS LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY WELL KNOWN TO OUR COMMUNITY SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. THAT IS OUTLINED IN THE WORK THAT THE PROPER STATE HOSPITAL HAS HAS SHARED IN THE PAST- THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY RECEIVING THE FULL ARRAY OF COMMUNITY BASED CARE. SO THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP ACTUALLY REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PRESSURE OFF OF THESE SYSTEMS THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE IS HOW CAN WE BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEMS HOW CAN WE SUPPORT. THOSE STRATEGIES ON THE PART OF COUNTIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DELIVERING FULL SERVICE CARE SERVICES IN WAYS THAT ARE COST EFFECTIVE. AND THESE BECOME PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FOR PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE ARE CYCLING THROUGH HOSPITALS JAILS AND THE STREETS. M. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AVAILABLE FOR FAR FOR FOSTERS PARTNERSHIPS IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH. THE QUESTION FOR THE STATE REALLY SHOULD LOOK AT WHETHER THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE. BOTH IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE IN A VOLUNTARY MANNER. KEEPING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES KEEPING PEOPLE IN SERVICES FOR WHICH THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL MATCHING OFTENTIMES NOT ALWAYS BE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED. ANY IF THEY ACTUALLY. LOWER OUR LONG TERM COSTS. N ADDITION TO THAT WITH OUR THAT THE STATE ALSO NEEDS TO BE THINKING EVEN FARTHER UPSTREAM. HOW CAN WE DELIVER CARE THROUGH PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SO WE DON'T EVEN NEED AS MANY FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP SLOTS. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE FINDING IN TALKING TO OTHER STATES YES THEY'RE TYING TOGETHER THEIR EFFORTS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE VERY EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF US SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. WITH THEIR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVES OTHER STATES ARE ARGUING THAT BECAUSE PSYCHOSIS TENDS TO START IN THE TEEN YEARS FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE. THAT SCHOOLS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT GATEWAYS TO ACCESS TO SUPPORTING PEOPLE TO ENTER INTO SERVICES SO THEY DON'T BECOME. SEVERELY AND PERSISTENTLY MENTALLY ILL MENTALLY ILL AND HOMELESS AND INVEST BECOME AT HIGH RISK FOR MULTIPLE ARRESTS AT HIGH RISK FOR FELONY CHARGES AND IT HIGHER BEST HIGH RISK OR- STATE HOSPITALIZATION. IT'S NOT THE FOLKS THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THE STATE HOSPITALS AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP WE- THEY MAY BE PRIOR TO THEIR ARREST. IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND IS ARE THOSE PROGRAMS WORKING EFFECTIVELY AS. THEY CAN AND HOW DO WE HELP STRENGTHEN. THIS SO ALONG THOSE LAWS IT LOOKS. I KEEP I'M GOING TO STICK ON THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I FOUND THIS ISSUE PARTICULARLY FAXING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND- I'M REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND DIG INTO THIS ONE DATA POINT WHICH IS THAT. 50% OF THE I. S. FELONY I S. T. POPULATION DID NOT GET TREATMENT SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR ARREST. AND SO IF THAT'S THE CASE MY UNDERSTANDING THEN WOULD BE THAT THEY MOST LIKELY WERE GETTING MISDEMEANOR. ARRESTS WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER FELONY ARE THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND I'M WONDERING WHAT. WAS LACKING WITHIN THAT- THAT CARE THAT LED TOWARDS THE- SUBSEQUENT FELONY ARREST AND I THINK THE PART THAT I'M- I'VE STRUGGLED WITH THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS THE DISK JOINTED. ASPECT OF THIS. CARE AND I'M WONDERING WHY WE AREN'T STREAMLINING IT AND WHY WE DON'T HAVE A- MORE- WHOLISTIC APPROACH TO CARING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TIME I GUESS NOW MY QUESTION IS FOR DR KELLY TO PULL YOU IN AND SEE IF I CAN HAVE YOU COMMENT ON- THIS DISCUSSION AT THIS TIME. SURE THANK YOU TO RAMBLE WELL I THINK FIRST OF ALL THERE THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION BEING MADE THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN. DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AS A MEDICARE BENEFICIARY SO THERE'S BACK NUMBER ONE- ALSO WE ARE SERVING EVERYONE IN COMMUNITY BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE AND I'M SURE OUR PARTNERS DISH WILL HAVE MORE. LEGAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO STATE BUT AT LEAST SOMEONE IS FOUND TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THAT MEANS THEY'RE THEY'RE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS STOPS THEY HAVE AN EVALUATION TO DETERMINE THEIR COMPETENCY AND THEN THEY ARE EITHER- THERE ARE A COUPLE. OF COMPETENCY CAN BE RESTORED WHETHER IT'S IN CUSTODY AT THE JAIL SYSTEM LIKE WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTY- AT OUR WEBSITE DETENTION CENTER OR- THEY COULD BE DEPENDING. ON A LOT OF THINGS- PLACED AT THE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE RESTORATION OF THEIR COMPETENCY BUT ONCE THE COMPETENCIES RESTORING THE IDEAS THEY WOULD GO BACK. THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDING IS NOT SHOUT ON THE CRIME MIGHT HAVE STILL YOU KNOW STILL STILL EXISTED SO IT'S THE PROCESS THERE WE CERTAINLY SERVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON PAROLE OR PROBATION WHO'VE COMMITTED CRIMES. AND THIS IS BRINGING. DIFFICULTY LIES FOR US IS- EVEN LOOKING AT DIVERSION DIVERSION MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION FROM OUR SECURE COURTS PERSPECTIVE. IS IF THEY SEE SOMEONE WHO HAS A MENTAL HEALTH- RELATIONSHIP TO THE CRIME AND THEY CAN DIVERT THEM FROM THE COURT PROCEEDINGS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO. INTO A JAIL SYSTEM AND THEY CAN THEN BE. RECEIVED AND TREATMENT WITH US- AND THERE'S NO FUNDING FOR THAT THERE'S THE REGULAR FUNDING THAT WE HAVE TOO MANY CAL IF THE PERSON BEING REFERRED TO AS A MEDIC CAL BENEFICIARY SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT. SO ADD TO YOUR POINT ABOUT IT BEING A DESPERATE SYSTEM EIGHT IT IS THAT I THINK THAT'S WHY HAVING THIS SORT OF A HEARING TO TALK WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS AT THE SAME TIME IS VERY BENEFICIAL I WOULD LIKE TO. TRANSPACIFIC TO THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS TO I'M SURE CHRIS IS ON I CAN SEE HER- I HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION DOCTOR AND- WOULD LOVE TO POLARON MISFEASANCE. SHE WIRING- WHY I'M- MY PERSONAL. M. I MEAN I KIND OF THINK THAT SHE STEM FROM SORT OF THREE DIFFERENT SONGS- ONE EIGHT ONE IS CAPACITY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS- MORE ALTERNATIVES TO DIVERT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING CRISIS RATHER THAN PUTTING THEM IN JAIL. AND I THINK THAT THEY WROTE HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL. AS WELL AS US-AS A AS AN ADMINISTRATION AS A STATE SOMETHING THAT I. N. G. WAIVER- FROM THE EXCLUSION ARM ARE GOING TO BASICALLY AND- EXPANDED OUR ABILITY AT THESE OPTIONS- ARM. TO AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF IT IS BACK AYE ISSUE CONTENT COMMITMENT IS ONE OF THE ONLY PATHWAYS TO COMPEL. OR RATHER FORCE SOMEONE IN. AN ORDER THEM INTO TREATMENT. RIGHT- AND CAN WE LOOK OTHER STRAT. ARE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WILL TO REDUCE THE LIKE. OF SOMEONE EXCUSE A MENTAL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THAT. SO HOW DO WE GET TO THAT PLACE RIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE'VE JUST BEEN HEARING- FROM THE PARTNERS THAT WILL WORKING WITH. DIVERSION IS REALLY HAVING AN ADEQUATELY TRAINED TO WORK TOWARDS- THOSE THAT ARE TRAINED ON THE INTERVENTIONS AND STRATEGIES TO EFFECTIVELY WORK WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT'S REALLY. YOU KNOW- THAT'S ASSESSING RISK THAT IS INCORPORATING STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THAT RISK AS PART OF THEIR OVERALL HOLISTIC TREATMENT PLANS SO WORKING AT WORK. WORK INCREMENTALLY- TACKLING NASRI BUT THEY'VE REGION AND THEN ALSO WHAT PROPOSING YOUR SEATS. HE. BY YOU KNOW IT'S MY- SALT THAT. THAT PROGRAMS LIKE THE FULL SERVICE FOR. CAN BE FOR POPULATION BUT I THINK THE IS- AND TOTAL. THAT IT WAS ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS VERSUS WHAT THE I. S. T. MEDNAX WHERE IS THAT ABILITY TO COMPEL AND FORCE TREATMENT- WHICH WE DON'T LIKE TO SAY FORCED BUT IT IT IS IT IS- IT IS THAT LEGAL MECHANISM. MINUTE MECHANISM THAT IS REQUIRING THAT INDIVIDUAL TO RECEIVE TREATMENT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT COMPETENCY RESTORATION IS REALLY NOTHING MORE FROM OUR ARMED STANCE. IS DESTABILIZING AN INDIVIDUAL THAT IS- ON EXPERIENCING ON OUR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS RIGHT STABILIZING THAT INDIVIDUAL BEGINNING I'M ON THE RIGHT MEDICATION STABILIZING THEM AND THEN TEACHING THEM YOU KNOW A FEW THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO AFFECTED WILL STAND TRIAL ALL. BUT ONCE THAT INDIVIDUAL IS STABILIZED IN WHATEVER ENVIRONMENT THAT IS THEY COULD THEN BE REVOKED AT AND CONSIDERED FOR DIVERSION OR OTHER. SORT OF LOWER LEVEL SERVICES IN THE- I'M GOING BRING. IT'S TOBY YOU IN BUT I WANT TO FOLLOW WITH A QUESTION SEAT AND CAN AND- I DIDN'T READ THE NEW ONE THAT HAVE ONLY PER COUNTY AND NOT ALL CAN THAT WOULD BE- GOING THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT AND SO WAS HOPING YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE ON SCALE AND PRIORITIZATION FOR COUNTIES. AT THIS TIME. SURE YEAH WE YES WE ARE DEFINITELY ONLY PROPOSING- TO WORK WITH A HANDFUL OF COUNTIES. WE SERVE OUR MORNING LOW BASIS I THINK WE'RE OVER FORTY FIVE HUNDRED PER YEAR AND WE ARE ONLY PROPOSING TO SERVE THIS PROPOSAL UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE COUNTIES IDENTIFIED NEED MODELS ARE FUNDING ESTIMATE AND OUR POPULATION ESTIMATE. ON A SAMPLING OF TOWNIES THAT REPRESENT KIND OF. A DIVERSE GEOGRAPHIC. ARRAY OF. AS WELL AS REP- SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZED COUNTIES- AND SO- WELL I CAN'T NAME ALL OF THE FAMILIES WE ARE WORKING WITH- WE HAVE ASKED FOR TWO MINUTES BY THE END OF MARCH AT THE LATEST SO THAT WE CAN- DISCLOSE WHO THOSE KINDS ARE BY AND BY THE TIME AND LOCATION. WITHOUT A LIKE TO- PULL TOBY PLEASE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW I WON TO ADD THAT THE QUESTION YOU ASKED REALLY IS THE ANALYSIS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO CALL FOR. THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS IN SOME PHENOMENAL WORK AND OPEN THE DOOR ON THIS I THINK IT WAS DR WARBURTON ARE A PART OF HER TEAM THAT REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THAT PERCENTAGE THAT YOU REFERENCED AND SO THERE'S NOT A WHOLE SERIES OF QUESTIONS HERE AND WE ARE WORKING WITH COUNTY USED TO DO THAT ANALYSIS I'M IN A IN I THINK TEN COUNTIES WHERE WE ARE HELPING THEM CONNECT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH DATA AND THEIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA. BUILDING OFF OF THIS DIFFERENTIAL INTERCEPT MODEL AROUND VERSION SO THAT WE DON'T WAIT UNTIL THERE ARE FIFTEEN ARRESTS AND WE'RE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT ARE THE RIGHT PEOPLE INFO SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE NOT ARE WE DELIVERING COMMUNITY BASED CARE IN A WAY THAT IS VOLUNTARY SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MOVE TO A CRIMINAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE STRATEGY OR- AT A STATE HOSPITAL KIND OF STRATEGY WHERE IDEAS ABOUT COMPETENCY RESTORATION. I'M BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT ANALYSIS STATEWIDE WE'RE NOT DOING THAT ANALYSIS AS THOROUGHLY AS NEEDS TO HAPPEN SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MOVE LIMITED DOLLARS FROM VERY EXPENSIVE THE BAND CARE TWO MORE FLEXIBLE AFFORDABLE MORE VOLUNTARY PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION CARE AND AGAIN I KNOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE CAN TAKE PEOPLE OUT OF THE STATE HOSPITAL TODAY THIS IS MORE ABOUT HOW DO WE- MOVE OUR RESPONSE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGH END NEEDS. TO EARLY STAGES RIGHT IF WE WERE TO USE A CANCER ANALOGY WHAT'S ON THE TABLE IS BUILDING MORE CANCER WARDS RATHER THAN SAYING HOW DO WE PREVENT AND INTERVENE EARLY SO WE NEED LESS OF THESE HIGH AND THE PRESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS. AND AT THE MOMENT WE NEED BOTH M. BUT THERE'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE ANALYSIS. AT EACH COUNTY LEVEL- AND COUNTIES THAT IN TURN PASSED BUT MANY DOWN. AND THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE STATE REALLY CAN SUPPORT OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO UNDERSTAND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO TRACK POPULATIONS THROUGH THE SYSTEMS AND IDENTIFY THE AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR INTERVENTIONS. REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE DOLLARS MORE EFFECTIVELY PARTICULARLY IF WE CAN PARTNER WITH BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENTERS A MEDIC CAL. AND THE AND THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE SECTOR SO I DON'T WE DON'T KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE PRIVATE SECTOR INSURANCE WHO NEED THESE THIS LEVEL OF CARE. BUT IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE SEEING AROUND EARLY PSYCHOSIS IS QUITE OFTEN YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE BUT AS THEIR NEEDS ESCALATE THEY OFTEN DROP OFF OF THEIR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. AND THOSE COST SHIFT OVER TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT'S AN AREA THAT NEEDS FURTHER EXPLORATION- WITH THAT I WILL TABLE THE- QUESTIONS AND- APPRECIATE THAT COMMENTED I DO KNOW WANTS TO FOCUS ON- DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE. INVESTMENT AND- I WILL JUST START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS SO WE CAN HAVE THE I AM DEEP WAVER AND- WANTS TO PUT IN THE LEGISLATURE. VALUES INTO ASKING- FOR. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A LENDS TOWARDS EQUITY AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT- THERE WERE INVESTMENTS TO HELP TO PROTECT OUR FOSTER YOUTH- WANTED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE- REQUEST OF DH CS AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON HOW WE CAN ENSURE THOSE FUNDS- GOES TO THOSE TARGETED POPULATIONS FIRST AND SECOND WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON MACHEL CABRERA'S COMMENTS REGARDING- DIFFICULTIES WITH CERTAIN COUNTIES AND SEE IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THE FLEXIBILITY ISSUES AND NECESSITY FOR HAVING THAT- TWENTY PERCENT. CAN YOU HAVE. SO I THINK WE WOULD- DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU IN REGARDS TO CONSIDERING BOTH EQUITY AND FOSTER YOUTH CONNECTIONS WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS I THINK. AS WE- ALSO HAVE INCLUDED A NUMBER OF R. KELLY PROPOSALS THE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT FOSTER YOUTH ARE GETTING ADEQUATE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CONNECTION TO THE FULL CONTINUUM IS REALLY CRITICAL ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE. PARTNERING AND WORKING WITH OUR- DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICE COLLEAGUES- RIGHT NOW IN REGARDS TO YOU- FOSTER YOUTH WHO WERE OTHERWISE SENT OUT OF STATE- IN OUR COUNTIES HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP IN REGARDS TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES. ATTENDED THE VERY UNIQUE AND COMPLEX NEEDS OF THOSE OF FOSTER YOUTH AND CHILDREN- AND SO I THINK WE WILL DEFINITELY KEEP IN MIND HOW FOSTER YOUTH CAN BE A BETTER SERVED THROUGH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. A DOLLARS AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON EQUITY GAPS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE CAN DEFINITELY PUT THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON OUR EQUITY ROAD MAP RIGHT NOW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS A CORE COMPONENT. OF THAT WORK IN WILL DEFNITELY KEEP THAT IN MIND. AS WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE THAT THOSE PIECES- IN REGARDS TO A MISS COOPER'S COMMENTS EARLIER REGARDING THE VERY WILLING- AND REQUESTED BOTH FROM C. SACK AND CBH DA. WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS TYPES OF PIECES THEY WOULD LIKE THE DEPARTMENT TO CONSIDER FOR THE LOCAL MATCH- AND WE WILL PARTNER CLOSELY WITH THEM ON THAT GIVEN THE- HISTORIC RESPONSIBILITY OF COUNTY IN. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH THE COUNTY AS WE DO I FEEL LIKE THE LOCAL MATCH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL- AND JUST REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH COUNTIES- AT ITS YOU ULTIMATELY MAKE THAT WORK AND SO. AGAIN OPEN TO THE FLEXIBILITY THERE AND I KNOW I'M POTS THAT WILL GET US FEEDBACK WE CAN. IN REGARDS THAT. I WILL JUST END BY- REALLY THANKING APPRECIATING THE ADMINISTRATION FOR- IN LIEU OF SERVICES AS WELL AS THE ENHANCED CARE BENEFITS WE HAVE BEEN. WORKING AND ADVOCATING FOR. HELP WITH SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND REALLY BELIEVE THESE TWO BENEFITS TAKE US A LONG WAY TOWARDS- FINDING EQUITY AND JUST WANNA MAKE SURE TO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ALL THE HARD WORK IN THIS SPACE. WITH THAT WILL- THANK VERY MUCH PANEL FOR AND MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL ON THE MEDIC CAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSALS- WE WILL HAVE FIVE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL WILL HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END. PLEASE BEGIN. ALL RIGHT- SO I'M GONNA START WITH GOING OVER A FEW OF THE CALLIN PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED TODAY I'LL BE BRIEF BECAUSE I DO KNOW WE HAVE THE OTHER CALLIE. BUT HEARINGS- THE PERSON REALLY HAS TO DO WITH PAYMENT REFORM I DCS IS PROPOSING TO TRANSITION FROM A COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY Q. A FEE SCHEDULE OF REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY AND THIS WILL REALLY HELP REMOVE SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT THE COUNTIES FACED. REGARDS TO COST BASED AUDITING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY WITH ASSOCIATED FINAL COST RICK RECONCILIATION AND DOCUMENTATION ISSUES THAT WE HAVE FACED IN THE PAST- IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THIS A PAYMENT RATE WE WILL HAVE TO TRANSITION THE COUNTIES TO- AT WHAT'S CALLED HEALTHCARE COMMON PROCEDURE CODING SYSTEM OR TAKE PIC. OF LEVEL ONE CODES- FOR CERTAIN PROCEDURES AND CPT CODES WHEN POSSIBLE WHICH WILL ALSO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO LOOK AT VARIOUS HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH OUTCOMES WITH FUTURE REPORTING SO IT'S A IT'S A DOUBLE POSITIVE THERE- THE PROPOSAL WILL ALSO A GROUP NANA REGIONAL OR PEER GROUPINGS FOR THE RATE SETTING PURPOSES. WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR MORE GRANULARITY- IN DH CS REYES SETTING AS WELL AS EQUITABLE PAYMENTS TO COUNTIES. AND SO IMPORTANT FACTOR THERE. ON THE NEXT FOR- WITHIN KELLY HIS AROUND THIS. AND ALSO QUICKLY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE KEY CHANGES AROUND MEDICAL NECESSITY IT REALLY HELPS CLARIFY THE DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN MANAGED CARE AND THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. AS WELL AS CLARIFIED IN A VERY COMPONENTS FOR THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I'M INCLUDING ENSURING EASY ACCESS- FOR CHILDREN EXPERIENCING TRAUMA. HOMELESSNESS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM- FINE VARIOUS EPS D. T. SERVICES AND REQUIREMENTS AND THAT- SERVICES. IT ALSO IS FOCUSING ON ENSURING BENEFICIARIES CAN ACCESS TREATMENT WHILE THEY ARE BEING ASSESSED FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS. AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING STANDARDIZED SCREENING- IN TRANSITION TOOLS TO ENSURE BENEFITS YEARS YOU'RE GETTING. CARE QUICKLY AND RELIABLY THERE IS A NO WRONG DOOR IN TREATMENTS CO- WITH CO OCCURRING DISORDERS AS WELL AS CLARIFYING OUTPATIENT AND INPATIENT MEDICAL NECESSITY DEFINITIONS- IMPROVING THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND LASTLY STREAMLINING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS TO ALIGN WITH MEDICAL CARE- AND REDUCING- BURDENS ON PROVIDERS. OF COURSE KEEPING IN MIND THE UNIQUENESS OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE ALSO ARE PUTTING FORWARD A PROPOSAL AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION- APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THIS YEAR IS MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS ALSO HAVE A CO OCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER- AND THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM INTEGRATED-TREATMENT WHERE WE CAN IDENTIFY. THE STATE OF COVERS OF MEDICAL AS YOU DEMAND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THREE SEPARATE COUNTY CONTRACTS TODAY- WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR COUNTIES TO CONTRACT WITH PROVIDERS AND OFFER INTEGRATED TREATMENT WHEN A PROVIDER IS ABLE AND WILLING TO PROVIDE. INTEGRATED AS TREATMENT FOR CO OCCURRING DISORDERS. OF FOR EXAMPLE COUNTIES ARE SUBJECT TO TWO SEPARATE ANNUAL QUALITY ASSESSMENTS TO SEPARATE HOST PAYMENT CHART AUDITS- INTO SEPARATE REIMBURSEMENT COST REPORTING METHODOLOGIES. IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE SEPARATE- PROCESS THESE PROVIDERS OFFERING INTEGRATED TREATMENT TO A MEDICARE BENEFICIARY MUST DOCUMENT- S. U. D. TREATMENT ARMED SERVICES SEPARATELY FROM MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SERVICES. ALSO THE PROPOSAL REALLY IS AROUND STREAMLINING THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS FOR BOTH THE S. U. D. N. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT OVER A FIVE YEAR ROAD MAP THIS IS NOT A SHORT LIVED- HERE. IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE A SINGLE CONTRACT BY. TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN IS THE PROPOSAL. THE DEPARTMENT ALL PUT FORWARD A NUMBER OF IDNS ODS REFORMS ARE WITHIN THE- PROPOSAL ELIMINATING THE TUESDAY ANNUAL LIMIT FOR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. CLARIFYING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOVERY SERVICES ARE REQUIRING ALL FACILITIES TO OFFER- OR REFER FOR MEDICATION TREES AT YOUR ASSISTED TREATMENT. I'M TO ADD EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR YOUTH UNDER TWENTY ONE AB CULTURALLY DEFINED SERVICES AND NATURAL HEALER FOR A BENEFIT FOR INDIAN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES CLARIFY MEDICAL NECESSITY AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AS WELL AS OTHER VERY. NEAR TECHNICAL UPDATES. THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL AROUND DRUG MEDI CAL PARITY ARE THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO REVIEW OUR PARITY ON A REGULAR BASIS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PARITY ACT- AND SO WE HAVE PUT FORWARD SOME RECOMMENDED CHANGES FOR OUR DRUG MEDI CAL COUNTIES. INCLUDING ALIGNING GRIEVANCES AND APPEAL PROCESS PROCESS EASIER FOR BENEFICIARIES WHEN THEY ARE DENIED SERVICES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE IMPLEMENTING AND NOTICE OF ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATION WE WOULD RE REQUIRING DNC STATE PLAN COUNTIES ARE NOW. REQUIRED TO CREDENTIAL ALL OF THEIR- CONTRACTED PROVIDERS AS WELL AS PROVIDE A PROVIDER DIRECTORY- SO- I'M A DMCA YES THE NC STATE PLAN COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE A CLOSE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS- AND BENEFICIARIES RESIDING AT COUNTY CAN RECEIVE DNC STATE PLAN SERVICES FROM ANY CERTIFIED. TNCS THE PLAN PROVIDER HOWEVER IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH PARITY WE DO STRONGLY FEEL THAT COUNTY SHOULD CREATE AND PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THEIR COUNTY A PROVIDER DIRECTORY ESPECIALLY TO ALLOW FOR EASY ACCESS IN SEARCHING FOR- SERVICES AVAILABLE AND CLOSE TO THEM WHICH WE DO THINK IT'S A BRIGHT BENEFITS YOUR SHOULD HAVE. WHICH MEANS THE NEXT ONE IT'S REALLY AROUND LOOKING AT NETWORK ADEQUACY FOR DMC- COUNTY STILL BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY IT WORKS IN THE MANAGED CARE COUNTIES BECAUSE IT IS B. FOR SERVICE BUT ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES CLOSE TO THEIR HOME IS CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT SOMETHING WE WOULD BE. IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THAT PARITY PROPOSAL. OUR NEXT- IN REGARD TO THE WORK ON- THE ENACT OF SENATE. EIGHT OH THREE DH CS IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST AS A DISTINCT MEDICARE PROVIDER TYPE. COUNTIES OR AN ENTITY ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WILL CERTIFY THE PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACS STANDARDS- BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY ONE DH CS WELL ESTABLISHED STATEWIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST- CERTIFICATION FOR OUR PARTICIPATING COUNTIES- DH CS HAS BEEN. CONDUCTING EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT REGARDING THIS EFFORT WITH COUNTIES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSOCIATIONS APPEAR ASSOCIATIONS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC- DH CS HAS ALSO BEEN CONDUCTING LISTENING SESSIONS WHICH ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL. AND LASTLY I DO USE YES RECOGNIZES THAT CALIFORNIA FACES OF WORKFORCE CHALLENGES. WELL WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE WORKFORCE STRATEGY A 2% TODAY WE HAVE SEVERAL STRATEGIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING IN PLACE TO SUPPORT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. I'M NOTABLY THE ONE THAT I JUST WALK THROUGH OF A REGARDING THE MEDIGAP HERE'S EXPANSION DO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE A GREAT DEVELOPMENT REGARDS TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHICH WOULD BE ROLLED OUT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWO. AND THEN AGAIN MENTIONED EARLIER- WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PAYMENT REFORMS WHICH WILL GIVE COUNTIES MORE FLEXIBILITY. FOR PROVIDER PAYMENT AND REMOVE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE BURDEN SUMMER CHOIR MATES FOR COST REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR FAR TOO LONG. I SO WE ARE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS IN THOSE AREAS AND REALLY WORK I HOPE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. AND THAT. IS THE END OF MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NEXT HEAR FROM DR K. ARAMBULA. SO WE WANT TO FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION ON CAL AMOS C. B. H. J. IS STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROPOSALS AND CAL AIM. INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PAYMENT REFORM MEDICAL NECESSITY REFORMS MENTAL HEALTH AND S. U. D. INTEGRATION AND OF COURSE THE I AM D. WAIVER FOR ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND TAKEN TOGETHER WE REALLY BELIEVE. THAT THESE REFORMS WILL LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT OVERDUE SYSTEM MODERNIZATION AND TRANSFORMATION. WE'RE ALSO DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO DH CS. EVER THEIR CONSISTENT ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH THAT CAN BE HAVE A HALL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS FOR INPUT ON THESE PROPOSALS. AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE VALUABLE DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORMS WE DO EMPHASIZE THAT IT WILL BE CRITICAL. TO RETAIN THE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. AND THIS INVESTMENT WILL SUPPORT SUCCESSFUL AND SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF PAYMENT REFORM AND MEDICAL NECESSITY PROPOSALS THAT REQUIRE COUNTIES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THEIR FISCAL AND IT SYSTEMS. I BECAUSE COUNTY BEER HELP CANNOT RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT IN EXCESS OF THE COST OF SERVICE DELIVERY WE DO NOT MAINTAIN LARGE OPERATING RESERVES AND WE HAVE ONLY VERY LIMITED FUNDING OR CAPITAL. IMPROVEMENTS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND JUST SAY SO CONSEQUENTLY UNLIKE THE MANAGED CARE PLAN PARTNERS WE HAVE NO MONEY SET ASIDE TO INVEST IN THE TYPES OF SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL. BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT CAL AIMED. AT PRESENT COUNTIES MUST OBSERVE A SERIES OF HIGHLY RIGID AND PRESCRIPTIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF NEARLY ALL OF OUR SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH AND- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AND THESE REQUIREMENTS. FOR REIMBURSEMENT ARE ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME I'M NOT CLIENT CENTRED AND ALMOST CERTAINLY HINDER ACCESS AND EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HEALTH EQUITY. THERE'S NO COMPARABLE REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. I HAVE TO MEET SETTING THIS EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH BAR FOR ACCESS TO SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND BE ABLE HEALTH SERVICES HAS BEEN STIGMATIZING AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE GOAL OF IMPROVING ACCESS. TO CARE- OFTEN IT TAKES MULTIPLE VISITS. ADD TO GET TASKS AND DIAGNOSIS DONE ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE SIDE- BUT OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE PARTNERS GET PAID AND I CAN- GET PAID IMMEDIATELY. WE DON'T WE NEED A DIAGNOSIS THAT SOMETIMES HARDER WE NEED MORE TIME TO RULE OUT IS THIS A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER IS THIS A METHAMPHETAMINE INDUCED PSYCHOSIS WHAT IS THIS. AND JUST EXISTING CHALLENGE HIGHLIGHTS THE VALUE OF THE PROPOSED CAL AIM PAYMENT AND MEDICAL NECESSITY REFORMS AND I MISSED COOPER JUST TALKED ABOUT AND THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE REFORMS ARE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED. THE REFORMS TO ADULT AND CHILDREN'S MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA WILL IMPROVE ACCESS SPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS IT WILL REMOVE THE GATEKEEPER DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA. DIGESTERS PROPOSED TO SIMPLIFY AND UPDATE MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA TO CREATE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITIES FOR REIMBURSEMENT SO IDENTIFYING A MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DIAGNOSIS AND ALSO TO REVISIT DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. TO ALIGN THEM WITH MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND FLEXIBLE APPROACHES WE NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME TREATING OUR CLIENTS NOT OUR CHART. AT PRESENT AT WE ALSO WE ALSO LOOKING FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE REFORMS INCLUDING- AT LATER SAID AS PRESENT IN ORDER TO REIMBURSE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE US SPECIAL MENTAL HEALTH AND- S. U. D. SERVICES COUNTIES HAVE TO REQUIRE VERY IN DEPTH HIGHLY REGIMENTED ASSESSMENT AND I TREATMENT PLANNING PROCESS AND THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE SIMPLY JUST TO GET INTO THE DOOR SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE BEING SOMEONE WHO IS LIVING WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IN VERY LONG ASSESSMENT OR IF YOUR CLIENT WHO'S DEALING WITH A WITHDRAWAL FROM A SUBSTANCE HAVING TO SET FOR OUR LONG ASSESSMENT IN ORDER TO GET IN THE DOOR AND GET YOUR NEXT APPOINTMENT IS QUITE DIFFICULT IT CREATES OF FIVE- EXCESSIVE FISCAL RISK FOR COUNTIES WHEN SERVICES ARE DISALLOWED STRICTLY FOR MINOR DOCUMENTATION. ERRORS FINALLY WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL AS WELL FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERED AT THE HAVE A HEALTH DELIVERY SERVICES TO BE ACCESSIBLE BEAT TELEPHONICALLY TO CONTINUE TO BE ARRAIGNED REIMBURSED AT THE SAME RATE AS VIDEO SERVICES. GIVEN THE DIGITAL BY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND A PRIORITY ISSUE FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. SO MANY OF OUR DESERT AND MOUNTAIN REGIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A VERY LIMITED. CONNECTIVITY AND THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE A VERY LIMITED DATA PLANS. CBJ HAS ALSO ENGAGE THE ADMINISTRATION ENSURING THAT WE TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN THE CAL IN PROPOSED REFORMS. TO VIEW ACCESS NOT JUST IN TERMS OF PENETRATION RIGHT. BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF EQUITY WE BELIEVE THE MORE OF THE COMMUNITY DEFINED PRACTICES HISTORICALLY FUNDED BY COUNTIES UNDER AND I JUST SAY SHOULD BECOME MAD COW REIMBURSABLE PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE MEDICARE POPULATION. AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES HERE TONIGHT. NEXT I HAVE MICHELLE CABRERA SHE WOULD LIKE TO COME. THANK YOU CHAD NUMBER LAST I'M JUST GOING TO BUILD UPON AS- A DOCTOR KELLY'S REMARKS THAT THERE AND AGAIN I KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THEM AT THE FUNDING CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE BEEN THE WAYS IN WHICH CAL AIM. IS HOPING TO- IMPROVE ACCESS IMPROVE WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO LEVERAGE- MATIC HOW WITHIN THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM AS A WHOLE- AND YOU KNOW THAT PAYMENT REFORM PROPOSAL WILL REALLY GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS TRANSFORMING SOME OF THE- THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT HAS BEEN COULD NOT JUST ON- COUNTY PLANNED BUT ALSO- COUNTY PROVIDERS THE CONTRACT PROVIDERS- I WILL SAY THAT THE LACK OF FISCAL STABILITY. AS WELL AS B. R. CROSS BASED REIMBURSEMENT HAS MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAKE SYSTEM REINVESTMENT AND CAN TAKE ON AMBITIOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN A INITIATIVE OR EVEN TO- MEANINGFULLY MAKE EXPANSION PLANS SO WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THESE PROPOSALS UNDER CAL EIGHTEEN AS WELL AS THE I. IN D. WAIVER PROPOSAL WHICH AGAIN WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE STATE AND PULLING TOGETHER- YOU KNOW. I WILL SAY IN THE COMING YEARS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A BURGEONING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS I IT IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR POLICYMAKERS TO CONSIDER HOW WE SUPPORT THE INCREASED LEVELS OF SERVICE. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE RELIED ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FACT FOR THE LAST DECADE AND MORE TO FILL SOME OF THESE GAPS- IN TERMS OF WHAT IS NOT MEDIC HOW REIMBURSABLE BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO COMPARABLE INVESTMENT IN OUR EDU THE THIRD AT THE END. AND WHILE CVH DA CONTINUED SUPPORT- THE POSSIBILITY OF ALLOWING MORE FLEXIBLE USE OF MHSAA FUND FOR STD SERVICES. I THINK THAT IT IT IS IMPORTANT TO HEY IF. POST THAT IT IMPORTANT PRESS TO LOOK AT A COUPLE. SERVICES BE WHAT ALREADY. OUT MADE AVAIL FOR. MENTAL UNDER THE AND MAKE- WITH REGARD TO WORK FORCE SHORTAGES THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH BIRTH CENTER SAYS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL FACE. SUBSTANTIAL SHORTAGES IN ALL OCCUPATIONS AND- RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- OUR CURRENT TRENDS IN UTILIZATION ARE SUCH THAT WE WILL HAVE 41% FEWER PSYCHIATRISTS THAN NEEDED IN THE FUTURE- AS WELL AS 11% FEWER A LICENSED MARRIAGE FAMILY THERAPIST- AND ALPHEUS W. ETCETERA. WE ARE REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO- OPT INTO AND SELF FINANCE- THE B. THE BEGINNING OF MEDICARE HOW REIMBURSED PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST THROUGHOUT MEDIC HOW- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HOPING- THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS WE CAN- SIXTY EIGHT IN IN SECURING AROUND FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION IN STATE GENERAL FUND. JEFF TO HELP US SET UP STAND UP THE STATEWIDE CERTIFICATION PROCESS WHICH WILL BE MATCHED WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS- WE HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE BOTH REPORT THAT- AND ALTHOUGH PEERS WILL BE AGAIN AN OPTION THAT COUNTY YOU CAN FINANCE EVENTUALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BROUGHT INTO MEDIC HOW IS THE UNIFORM STATEWIDE BENEFIT. IN THE MEDIA- WE WILL WORK ON ON LIFTING THIS PROGRAM UP- COUNTY THEY'RE ALSO FINANCING THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT- AND VARIOUS WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS WHICH I WILL NOT GET INTO THAT TOO MUCH DETAIL ON HERE- BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND THEN. WE ARE THANKS TO FUNDING FROM THAT KAISER FOUNDATION WORKING ON A STATEWIDE- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE CAPTAIN ALEX THAT OUGHT TO LOOK AT NOT JUST. OUT THERE IF WE HAVE THAT MAKE WORKFORCE GAPS IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM BUT ALSO- WHAT THE NEEDS ARE IN TERMS OF EQUITY AND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE POPULATION DIFFERENCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN TO YOU CHERUB ARE BLACK AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR PULLING TOGETHER THE. HEARING ANY OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR OUR CHRIS. THANK YOU NEXT WILL FROM HOW SHE DOES THE LA ANALYST ON. MORE THANK YOU DOCTOR IN YOUR- JUST VERY BRIEFLY ON THE HEALTH SPECIFIC REFORMS OF THE CALENDAR- WE CERTAINLY FIND THAT THESE REFORMS COULD BRING MAJORPOTENTIAL BENEFITS TO THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM BY YOU KNOW MAKING BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES MORE ACCESSIBLE IN THE CASE OF YOU KNOW MEDICAL NECESSITY REFORMS- OR LESSENING THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON COUNTIES WHEN IT COMES TO BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY IN IN THE CASE OF PAYMENT REFORM- WE JUST HAVE NO ONE BROUGHT ISSUE TO BRING TO THE LEGISLATURES ATTENTION FIRST- IN GENERAL UNDER REALIGNMENT THE STATE IS YOU KNOW REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO COUNTIES AS A RESULT OF- NEW STATE MANDATES OR OR SORT OF HIGHER LEVELS OF SERVICE- SOME OF THE CALENDAR HERE HEALTH REFORMS- COULD. IMPACT THE FISCAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES DUE TO REALIGNMENT- SO FOR EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH THE REVISIONS TO MEDICAL NECESSITY COULD LEAD TO COUNTIES DRAWING MORE TRYING DOWN MORE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SERVICES THAT ARE ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED THEY COULD ALSO LEAD TO- INCREASING UTILIZATION OF BEHAVIORAL SERVICES- AND IN ADDITION YOU KNOW UNDER CAL EIGHTEEN- THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO- TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I'M FROM A MANAGED CARE PLAN TO THE COUNTY IN TWO CASES- WHICH COULD LEAD TO SORT OF A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN COUNTY COSTS IN THOSE COUNTIES- THESE YOU KNOW SORT OF POTENTIAL ONGOING COSTS ARE ARE NOT CURRENTLY BUILT INTO. MINISTRATIONS FUNDING PLAN FOR TELLING WOMEN WHETHER THE STATE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SORT OF FIND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT COUNTIES MAY BEAR FOR THESE REFORMS IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR- AND SO BROADLY SPEAKING THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER SORT OF WHAT THE IMPACT OF THESE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFORMS WILL BE SORT OF ON THE STATE AND COUNTY FISCAL RELATIONSHIP. UNDER UNDER REAL LIKE. THAT'S THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- IN LIGHT OF OUR ON THE FACT THAT WHEN WE STARTED DR KELLY HAD A REALLY NICE PALM TREE WHICH IS BEHIND AROUND THE WINDOW AND NOW IT'S A PRETTY DARK I WILL. KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT BUT JUST REALLY WANT TO ELEVATE THE HARD WORK THAT'S BEING DONE HERE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I. REALLY WANTED TO UPLIFT WITH DR KELLY SAID THAT WE NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR PATIENTS AND NOT OUR CHARTS I REMEMBER THOSE FEELINGS AND REMEMBER THOSE TIMES AND I REALLY DO WANT TO- ELEVATE THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN NOT TO DUPLICATE REPORTING HOW WE CAN HELP TO INTEGRATE TO TREATMENT HOW WE CAN. NOT LABEL PEOPLE BUT INSTEAD START TREATMENT SOONER AND REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE- GROUP OF REFORMS THAT WERE SPEAKING WILL TAKE US A LONG STEP FORWARD. WOULD LIKE TO END SIMPLY BY ELEVATING PEER SPECIALISTS- S. B. EIGHT OH THREE BY SENATOR BILL LAST YEAR. AND THE NEED FOR US TO INCREASE SUPPORT SERVICES- I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE NEED FOR A UNIFORM UNIFORM STATEWIDE BENEFIT.
