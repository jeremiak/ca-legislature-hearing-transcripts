THERE ARE SO MANY INFLUENCES THAT WE HAVE. BY BY A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT. MADE THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS WHILE BEING OPPRESSED. THEIR STORES SO MANY STORIES OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SO COURAGEOUS THAT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN. LIKE ONE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON'S SLAVES. OWN A JUDGE THAT IT'S AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN WHILE SERVING HIM. IN IN IN PHILADELPHIA HAD THE COURAGE TO RUN AWAY AND BECOME A FREE WOMAN. SHE RAN AWAY SHE BASICALLY DEFIED THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE LAND. I CAN I JUST I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS TO BE -- NOW AND TO BE CONTEMPLATING. RUNNING AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE TIME. AND IT JUST A OR THE THE LAST SLAVES TO EVER. BE TRAFFICKED INTO THE US. ILLEGALLY. THAT WAS A SHIPMENT THE CAVEMAN THE LAST SHIPMENT THAT WAS ACTUALLY INTERCEPTED AND THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AFTER. OUR THE SLAVE TRADE HAD BEEN. MADE ILLEGAL. AND HOW. THESE INDIVIDUALS PETITION TO BE RETURNED TO AFRICA AND NEVER WERE RETURNED [inaudible] AND THESE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY REFUSED.

MEMBERS WERE GONNA TAKE THE FOLLOWING SENATORS IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER. SENATOR GROW. SENATOR ARCHULETA CONSIDER MITCHELL. CENTER GROVE THE FORESHORES GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AS THE FIRST FEMALE VETERAN TO EVER SERVE IN THIS BUILDING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A VETERAN -- THAT IS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN INDIVIDUAL THAT SERVED IN WORLD WAR. TWO AND IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS BECAUSE I I THINK VETERANS SHOULD BE HONORED -- EXTREMELY -- WELL -- EDWARD ALLEN A CARTER US SERGEANT FIRST CLASS IN WORLD WAR TWO AND BACK IN WORLD WAR TWO THEY SEPARATED THE AFRICAN AMERICAN TROOPS FROM THE CAUCASIAN TROOPS. AND HE WAS ON AFTER HE SERVED IN SHANGHAI IN IN THE EUROPEAN THEATER TO JOIN THE SPANISH LOYALIST IN ORDER TO STOP. OF FRANCO'S REGIME HE ACTUALLY GOT STATIONED IN WORLD WAR TWO ERA IN GERMANY. HE HAD A BRIGADE OR EXCUSE ME A SMALL GROUP OF THREE OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND NOT WANTING ON PATROL THEIR TANK HAD TAKEN BAZOOKA FIRE. IN DURING THAT BAZOOKA FIRED ENABLED THERE TO GET STOPPED OR DISABLED THEIR TANK AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO CONTINUE. WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF THE TANK TO START TO MOVE FORWARD THEY REALIZE THEY WERE UNDER HEAVY FIRE AND AFTER HIDING BEHIND A WALL FOR A LONG TIME? HE REALIZED THAT THE THREE PEOPLE HIS COMRADES THAT WERE WITH HIM WE'RE GOING TO BE THEY'LL DIE IF HE DOESN'T DO SOMETHING SO THIS BRAVE MAN TOOK AND RAN OVER IF IT RAN A CROSS AN OPEN FIELD -- TAKING HEAVY GUNFIRE TO DRAW FIRE AWAY FROM THE GERMANS THAT WERE SHOOTING AT THE AT THE AT IS TEAM. AND WHEN HE WAS RUNNING ACROSS THAT FIELD HE SHE WAS SHOT HE HIT THE GROUND THEY TOOK OUT PART OF HIS THIGH HE WAS SHOT AGAIN IN THE SHOULDER HE SHOT AGAIN. IN THE SIDE OF HIS NECK AND EVERY TIME HE CONTINUE TO GET UP AND RAN TOWARDS THAT -- HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE UNTIL HE WAS ABLE TO THROW A GRENADE INTO THAT. OPPOSITION TO STOP THAT -- SHOOTING FROM TAKING PLACE ON HIS MEN THAT HE HAD LEFT BEHIND THAT WALL THAT HE WANTED TO PROTECT. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I WANT TO BRING IT TODAY IS IS THAT DURING THAT IS I BELIEVE THAT ALL VETERANS ARE GREEN. I THINK IN THE MILITARY DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU'RE IN THIS IN THE FOXHOLE WITH YOUR GREEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION LIKE THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER RACE GOES COMPLETELY OUT THE WINDOW. YOU'RE ALL THEIR FOR AMERICANS. AND BECAUSE WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR STORY IS A BACK THEN HE WASN'T EVEN THOUGH HE MET ALL THE CRITERIA FOR THE MEDAL OF HONOR THE HIGHEST AWARD THAT YOU CAN RECEIVE IN MILITARY. AND IN THE GOVERNMENT THE HIGHEST MILITARY AWARD IS A MEDAL OF HONOR. IN BACK THEN THEY DIDN'T ALLOW AFRICAN AMERICANS TO HAVE THE MEDAL OF HONOR SO HE WAS PUT IN FOR A DISTINGUISHED PROCESS WHICH THEY DID GIVE HIM. BUT IT WASN'T TOO MANY MANY YEARS LATER THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY -- GIVEN AFTER HIS DEATH THE MEDAL OF HONOR IT WAS PRESENTED BY PRESIDENT CLINTON TO HIS SON. WHO GRACIOUSLY RECEIVE THAT PROCEDURE SO WARD FOR HIS SERVICE IN WORLD WAR -- TWO AND SO I JUST WANT TO BRING UP A MILITARY VETERAN TODAY AND THANK YOU GUYS OFFER HONORING A BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND I WOULD VOTE I ON THIS RESOLUTION.

AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER AMERICANS HAVE MADE TO THIS COUNTRY. HISTORICALLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT NICK KNOWLEDGE CONTRIBUTIONS AFRICAN AMERICANS MAKE. EACH AND EVERY DAY. TWO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ALL AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIANS A PARTICULAR. I THINK IT'S TRAGIC THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT WE'RE EVEN HAVING A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER BLACKFACE IS OFFENSIVE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION IN YOUR MIND LET ME SELL IT FOR YOU TODAY. EDS. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT BLACK HISTORY THESE THE TIME WE SPENT ON THE FLOOR TO DO THESE COMMEMORATIONS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GIVES US A MOMENT. TO PAUSE IN TIME. AND PERHAPS THINK ABOUT OUR OWN KNOWLEDGE. LACK THEREOF. BIASES. AND PERHAPS MAKE A COMMITMENT TO OUR SALES IN OUR CONSTITUENTS. THAT WE WILL WORK VERY HARD TO BE BETTER AND DO BETTER. AS WE PRIORITIZE CRITICAL PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES THAT IMPACT ALL CALIFORNIANS BLACK IN OTHERWISE. AS MY COLLEAGUE TALKED ABOUT BEING FROM CALIFORNIA NOT BEING EXPOSED TO SOME OF THE SEGREGATION OBVIOUS SIGNS OF THE SOUTH. I WANT TO BRING EVERYONE'S ATTENTION TO THE DISPLAY THAT THE BLACK CAUCUS IS MADE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IF THE DISPLAY IS ENTITLED CALIFORNIA BOUND SLAVERY ON THE NEW FRONTIER FROM. EIGHTEEN FORTY TO EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE AS AN EXHIBIT THAT WAS CURATED BY THE CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM IN EXPOSITION PARK IN MY DISTRICT. THAT GIVES A VERY PAINFUL LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WITH REGARD TO THE SLAVE TRADE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE -- THAT REVERSED ITSELF ON TWO OCCASIONS IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE GOING TO ALLOW SLAVE OWNERS FROM THE SOUTH MAINTAINED THEIR OWNERSHIP OF HUMAN BEANS ONCE THEY CAME ACROSS INTO CALIFORNIA. FOLLOWING THE GOLD RUSH. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE BLOOD IS ON UR HANDS. TO THAT WE TO HAVE A QUESTIONABLE HISTORY IN TERMS OF THE LAND OF THE FREE. FLOW AGAIN I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE DISPLAY AND LEARN SOME THINGS LIKE IDEA IT WILL ONLY BE ON DISPLAY OUT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE UNTIL FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. BLACK FACE IMPLICIT BIAS OVER INCARCERATION. POLICE EXCESSIVE FORCE PAY EQUITY [inaudible] VOTER SUPPRESSION.

TO CHANGE THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM. WHICH WOULDN'T COULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VIETNAMESE AMERICANS DEPORTED BACK TO VIETNAM. DEPORTATION VIETNAMESE AMERICANS WILL NOT UNDER ONLY UNDERMINE THE SPIRIT OF THE AGREEMENT. BUT ALSO MUCH LIKE OTHER DEPORTATIONS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR LONG PERIODS. THEY'RE THE FAMILIES APART. PARTICULARLY FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR MANY MANY DECADES HERE -- AS YEAR WHERE MANY MANY SURVIVORS OF THE VIETNAM WAR WHO'VE COME HERE THE UNITED STATES ARE ALSO SURVIVORS OF COMMUNIST ATROCITIES.

THANK YOU SENATOR WOULD EITHER TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- SENATORS I TO RISE A STRONG SUPPORT OF HR ONE IT'S A CERTAINLY A VERY CRUEL DECISION BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. TO BASICALLY -- SAY THAT. VIETNAMESE REFUGEES WHO CAME OVER TO THIS COUNTRY AFTER THE VIETNAM WAR. ARE WHO AFTER SUFFERING THE TRAUMA OF THAT EXPERIENCE WHO MIGHT HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY FOR DECADES. AND NOW ARE. ABSTAINING CONTRIBUTING CITIZENS. SHOULD BE DEPORTED ACK TO VIETNAM. A COUNTRY WHO WHERE THEY MAY ACTUALLY BE A PERSONAL RISK FOR RETURNING AND CERTAINLY NO LONGER HAVE THE KIND OF TIES THAT THEY HAD WHEN THEY CAME OVER.

AND SO I GOT HERE EXTRAORDINARY STORIES OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH TO LEAVE THEIR HOME COUNTRY OFTEN AT GREAT PERIL TO COME TO AMERICA. WHEN I HEAR THESE STORIES I HAVE A SOFT SPOT? THAT THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM IS THAT IF WE DESIGNED TO DEPORT INDIVIDUALS WE MUST FIRST MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO UNDO HARDSHIP. IN DANGERS UPON THE REPATRIATION. AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR BASED ON THE HISTORY THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE COULD BE EXTRAORDINARY HARDSHIPS EXTRAORDINARY DANGERS SHOULD INDIVIDUALS. BE REPATRIATED TO THOSE HOME COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY IN GIVEN THE HISTORY THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCE WHETHER IT BE THE VIETNAMESE OR THE MALL -- WE KNOW THE GOING BACK IS NOT EASY SO BEFORE AN EVENT LIKE THAT HAPPENS WE MUST CERTAINLY.
