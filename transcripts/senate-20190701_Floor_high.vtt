00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:58.269
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SHOWN UP.

00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:01.272
WITH NEEDS THAT THEY CANNOT MEET.

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:03.108
I SUPPORTED A BILL A COUPLE

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:04.542
YEARS AGO THAT I'VE FORMALLY

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:06.010
NEVER WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.579

00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:21.526
IN AND I MUST SAY IN DESPERATION

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.194
I SAID I DO THAT BILL.

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:24.629
IT IS NOT THE ANSWER.

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:26.564
NOR IS JUST MORE MONEY BEING

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.099
POURED IN TO DEALING WITH THE

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.634

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.178
AND TO CREATE A POSITIVE

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:42.013
ATTITUDE WITHIN THOSE HOMELESS

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.581

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:47.952
THEMSELVES.

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:49.521
THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL IF WE'RE

00:29:49.587 --> 00:29:50.722
TO MOVE AHEAD.

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:53.158

HOUSING SOLVES HOMELESSNESS.

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:28.012
WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE OTHER

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:29.747
FACTORS BEYOND CITY PLANNING

00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:31.482

FOR HOUSING.

00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:44.062

ENCOMPASSES THAT VISION.

00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:01.045
SOME OF IT'S A LITTLE TOO MUCH

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:02.380

THE SHORT TIME FRAME WE'VE HAD.

00:33:04.615 --> 00:33:05.717

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.385
FRAME.

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:08.519
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IN THE

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:10.688
CONTEXT OF THE URGENT NATURE OF

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:12.623
THIS LARGER ISSUE IS THAT I AM

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:34.011
WORK HARDER THE TIME LINES HAVE

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:35.646
TO BE SHORTER EVEN THOUGH IN

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:36.914

00:36:36.827 --> 00:36:38.896
HAVE GROWTH LIKE THAT.

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.131
THERE'S NO WAY.

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:43.534
THAT WE CAN SERVE THE POPULATION.

00:36:45.736 --> 00:36:47.905
ESSENTIAL THING TO DO.

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:50.541
IS TO MAKE INTERVENTIONS BEFORE

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:52.243
PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.311

IS THAT THIS GROWTH IN HOMELESS

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:07.491

WE'RE NEVER HOMELESS BEFORE.

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:14.699
SO THEY WERE HOUSED.

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:16.701
THEY HAVE JOBS.

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:19.470
THEY'RE NOT MENTALLY ILL.

HOUSING.

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:50.101
AND BECOME HOMELESS BEFORE THEY

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:52.970
ARE AFFECTED JUST TO PREVENT

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:54.605
HAVING AN EVICTION.

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.607

ONCE YOU HAVE AN EVICTION IT IS

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:02.613
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TO THEN FIND

HOMELESSNESS AND IT IS FAR MORE

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:32.209
AFFORDABLE. TO KEEP PEOPLE WHO

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:35.413
ARE HOUSED IN THEIR PLACES.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:36.814
WITH THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:38.315

THEY ARE NOT AS SHE SAID.

INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:33.324
ISSUES OR WHO NEED SKILLS TO BE

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.426
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:36.961
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE FORCED

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:40.231
INTO LIVING IN THEIR CARS.

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:41.932
OR SOMEONE ELSE'S SO FAR OR

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:43.500
WORST ON THE STREETS OR

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:47.137
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE JOBS.

00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:49.073
MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS DON'T

00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:52.776
GET PAID ENOUGH. TO PAY THE RENT

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:54.245
IF WE SUPPORT THAT THEY SHOULD

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:55.579
BE PAYING THOSE RENTS THAT'LL

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.181
MAKE ENOUGH.

00:41:57.248 --> 00:42:00.584
AND THE RENT IS TOO HIGH.

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.419
TEACHERS LIVING IN THEIR CARS

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:05.322
AND STUDENTS ARE WORKING.

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:07.758
AND THEY ARE PAYING THEY ARE NOT

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:09.793
ABLE TO PAY THE RENT.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.427
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:12.196
IT.

00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:15.266
THIS CONVERSATION IS I TOTALLY

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:16.567
AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:18.369
SPOKE IN SUPPORT AND I WILL

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.471
SUPPORT AND VOTE THIS. FOR THIS

00:42:20.537 --> 00:42:22.673
BILL NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BECAUSE

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.208
IT'S A DRESSING TWO KEY

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:26.043
COMPONENTS.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.212
BUT THE OTHER KEY COMPONENT IS

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:29.780
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:32.583
CONTINUING MASSIVE NUMBER OF THE

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:33.651

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.486
THAT ARE FORCING MEN WOMEN AND

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:38.055
CHILDREN INTO THE STREETS.

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:40.190
BUILDING LOW INCOME HOUSING IS

00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:42.993
SO IMPORTANT.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.461
BUT THE REASON WE WANT LOW

00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:46.030
INCOME HOUSING IS BECAUSE THOSE

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:50.234
FAMILIES ARE HAVING A LOW INCOME.

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:50.868
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:53.704
THAT.

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:55.439
THIS IS A BROTHERS I'M GOING TO

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:57.408
KEEP USING THIS NUMBER OVER AND

00:42:57.474 --> 00:43:01.045
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:02.513
700-100-0 THE FAMILIES THAT ARE

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:04.448
SEVERELY PAYING SEVERELY OVER

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:07.184
BURDENED RENTS.

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.086
WE SHOULD NOT BE STUNNED OR

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:10.087
SHOCKED.

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:11.655
BUT THE CONTINUING NUMBER OF

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:14.191
HOMELESS IF WE IGNORE.

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:15.492
FAMILIES LIKE THAT.

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:17.695
