SO SENATOR PRO TEM ATKINS AND SENATORS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU AND TO BE CONSIDERED FOR CONFIRMATION TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. I THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY FITTING- THAT TODAY'S CONFIRMATION HEARING COMES ON THE HEELS OF MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY AND- WHICH WAS JUST THIS WEEKEND. I BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION IS A CORNERSTONE FOR CREATING PATHWAYS FOR CALIFORNIANS- TO EXPERIENCE SOCIAL ECONOMIC ABILITY. FAIRNESS EQUITY ACCOUNTABILITY AND ROBUST EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. IN A WAY THAT I TAKE TO BE SYNONYMOUS WITH DOCTOR KING'S VISION. MY OWN LIFE PATH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BUT FOR WHAT I THINK OF IT THE BEAUTY OF CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATIONAL PROMISE. ITS ABILITY TO LIFT UP HARD WORKING KIDS OF ALL COLORS AND STRIPES- WHETHER THEY WERE BORN TO TITANS OF INDUSTRY OR OF THE MOST HUMBLE OF FAMILIES. I'VE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WORKING AND WORKING WELL AND I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT. EVERY KID IN CALIFORNIA HAS THIS OPPORTUNITY. THIS BE TWENTY TWENTY. THE DAWNING OF A NEW DECADE. I THINK IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE PRIVILEGE OF THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. CLEAR EYED IN ARCTIC HOW AND WHAT EXPECT OF CALIFORNIANS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO BE A SYSTEM OF OPPORTUNITY EXCELLENCE IN BUILDING STRONG CHILDREN TO CONTRIBUTE. TO CONTRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED SUCCESS STORY IN THIS DECADE AND FOR MANY TO COME. TO ME BEING CLEAR EYED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION REQUIRES A FEW FUNDAMENTALS FIRST STARTING EARLY AND BUILDING STRONG CHILDREN FROM THE BEGINNING THIS MEANS STRENGTHENING EARLY LEARNING. AND CONNECTING EARLY LEARNING TO K. TO TWELVE SECOND I THINK IT MEANS SUPPORT SUPPORTING ROBUST TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA SO THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN BE PARTNERS. IN ACCOUNTABILITY AND LOCAL DECISION MAKING AND CLOSING PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. THESE ARE IMPORTANT CON CORNERSTONES FOR THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND I WOULD BE HONORED. TO SERVE THE BOARD IN THIS CAPACITY I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AN HONOR TO BE CONSIDERED FOR CONFIRMATION BY THE- TEAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON. IT DOMINO NOT I'M NOT GONNA READ I RESENT THE FACT THAT I'M LOSING MY EYESIGHT. YEAH AS LONG SO I'M IF YOU DON'T MIND I'M- WHEN I TRY GO BY MEMORY AND JUST TELL YOU WHAT I'M FEELING FROM- MY HEART AND AS A FORMER SUPERINTENDENT BREVITY IS NORMALLY NOT MY FRIEND I'M GONNA TRY TO WORK ON THAT TODAY- BUT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY FAMILY. WHO IT'S NOT EASY TO GET THREE TEENAGERS UP AT FIVE THIRTY IN THE MORNING TO GET TO SACRAMENTO. BUT THEY DID AND I HAVE MY THREE SONS OF MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE HERE- BRITAIN KENNEDY CONTRACT AND TIGHTLY THANK YOU- I'VE BEEN EDUCATION FOR- JUST OVER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS NINETEEN OF THAT WAS SPENT IN A LITTLE DISTRICT OUTSIDE FRESNO CALLED SINGER UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- FOR THOSE HE THAT WERE. FIELD BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN UNIFIED WAS ANOINTED AS THE- LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOL DISTRICT OF BOTTOM 2% SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THERE WAS THE TOWN THAT WHEN YOU DROVE IN IT SAID WELCOME TO SANGER NATION'S CHRISTMAS TREE CITY. AND RIGHT ABOVE THAT SAID WELCOME TO SANGER HOME OF FOUR HUNDRED AND HAPPY TEACHERS. SOUL I- CUT MY TEETH IN A DISTRICT. THAT BLESSING EXAMPLE. THAT CHANGE CAN HAPPEN- THAT YOU CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE- YOU CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE FOR CHILDREN IN NEED I AM A PRODUCT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION MYSELF MY MOTHER- WHO SINGLE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND- I SURVIVED BASED ON HER FORTITUDE AND COURAGEOUS- TRINA- HABITS. TO KEEP A YOUNG MAN WHO IS A DIFFICULT TO CONTROL ON THE RIGHT PATH. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT I MINISTER FATHER WHO OPENED MY EYES TO EDUCATION. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT I WAS EXPOSED TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND I FELL IN LOVE SERVING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS ME HERE I HOPE TO BRING TO THE BOARD- PERSPECTIVE. FROM THE LOCAL EDUCATOR PROTECT PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS- TO BE A VOICE FOR THOSE THAT DON'T OFTEN HAVE IT AND TO BE A VOICE OF IT IS POSSIBLE THEIR IMPROVEMENT CAN HAPPEN- IN LACK OF FUNDING. AN IMPROVEMENT CAN HAPPEN EVEN IN THE FACE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. I LIVED IT FOR X. AMOUNT OF TIME. I'M HONORED TO BE NOMINATED BY GOVERNOR SOME AND I WELCOME. ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERATION NOMINATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A LET ME ASK SENATOR ROTH IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START. APPROACH HIM FIRST CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE YOUR OR CONTINUED CONTINUING TO SERVE. AS THE CASE MAY BE- RESUMES ARE VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE I LOOK FORWARD TO. MOVING HERE CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION A MY PERCEPTION IS THAT THE- EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IMPORTANT MEDITATION OF OUR- EL CAP AND I'LL SEE IF OF PROCESS. IS UNEVEN AT BEST ACROSS THE STATE. WHAT ROLE DO YOU THINK WHAT IMPORTANT ROLE DO YOU THINK THAT THE BOARD HAS IN ENSURING BOTH THE- LET THE LC HEALTHCARE PROCESSES BOTH INCLUSIVE. AND EFFECTIVE. IF IT'S A FAIR QUESTION YES. THE BOTH OF US WE JUST PEPPER ONE ACCORD OKAY FOR BOTH SO- I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S QUITE HONESTLY THE TENSION THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME- WE HAVE SEEN POSITIVE RESULTS AS A RESULT OF THE WORK THAT LOCALS ARE DOING AND GRAPPLING WITH WITH LOCAL CONTROL WE HAVE. LESS SCHOOLS IN NEED OF DIFFERENCE ASSISTANCE AND WE SAW AN UPTICK IN MANY OF OUR- INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM IN FACT ONE OF THE SUB GROUPS THAT HAD THE STEEPNESS OF GREENS WAS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THE BALANCING ACT IS CREATING A MECHANISM WHERE WE CAN HEAR THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE STATE BOARD. AND WE LISTEN TO THOSE STAKEHOLDERS AND WE DON'T- DEVELOP IN MY OPINION. EL CAP THAT IS EVER ONE AND DONE IT'S A FOR GOING TO MODEL IMPROVEMENT ACROSS THE STATE AND THE IDEA FOR THE STATE BOARD IS THAT WE- TESTED. WE SEE IF IT CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVE AND WE LET THE DATA DRIVES THE OUTCOMES WE LET THE DATA DRIVES THE INTENSITY OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND THE- SUPPORTS THAT ARE NEEDED SO FOR ME I THINK AT AS A STATE BOARD I THINK IT'S AN INCUMBENT THAT WE HEAR THE STAKEHOLDERS- WE HEAR THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE HAVING WITH REGARDS TO. UNDERSTANDING THE ELCA MAKING SENSE F THE OKAY UP IN TERMS OF WHERE MONEY IS GOING AND HOW IT'S BEING CATERED AT THE SAME TIME WE BALANCED OUT BY. ANALYZING THE DATA HIGHLIGHTING THOSE THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE WORKING ACROSS OUR STATE- AND- MAKE THEM VISIBLE AND HAD. BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN LEARN SO AS A STATE BOARD MEMBER I WOULD CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN STATE WATER. BACK CERTAIN. IN FIND THAT POLAND. CHOIRS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. AND YOU'VE SEEN THE OBVIOUSLY SOME FROM SOME QUARTERS ANYWAY KERR OF OUR- IN THAT- NUMBER ONE THE MONEY THAT IS THE EXTRA MONEY THAT IS DESIGNED TO. SERVE OUR MOST VULNERABLE IN THE FORM OF CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDS IN THE LAKE ARE NECESSARILY REACHING THOSE POPULATIONS LEAST REPORTEDLY IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO. THAT THE EL CAP PROCESS- AT LEAST IN SOME QUARTERS IS ARGUABLY A CHECK THE BOX PROCESS AND NOT. NEARLY WHAT WE ANTICIPATED WHEN WE HAD THE DEBATE OVER LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING AND THE PROCESS FOR THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO MA'AM. AND YES I AM I THINK ONE OF THE INTERESTING DESCRIPTIONS I'VE HEARD OF LATE S LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE. IN CAPS LEADING THE L. CFF SHIFT- AS CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST EXPERIMENT IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN ITS HISTORY- OF MOVING. WHAT IS ROUGHLY 40% OF THE STATE BUDGET TO LOCAL DECISION MAKING- AT THE ELLIE A LEVEL. I DO THINK THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE- ATTEMPTS OF ESSENTIALLY ITERATING SO LCF WAS PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN- WE JUST ADOPTED THE FOURTH ITERATION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY- TEMPLATE- IN CHANGE TWO WEEKS AGO- AT THE STATE BOARD MEETING AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR- AND EACH ITERATION I THINK IS GETTING. GETTING CLOSER- TO SOMETHING THAT I THINK REACHES ASPIRATIONS THAT ANY OF US HAD FOR THIS PROCESS- WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK ALSO THAT WE ADOPTED IN THE JANUARY BOARD PROCESS WAS A REQUIREMENT AROUND HAVING. ELEAZAR DESCRIBE WHAT- THEY HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN ALSO WHAT COMPONENTS WERE ADOPTED INCORPORATED- IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING- REQUIREMENT BUT IT IT'S ONE THAT IS REALLY I THINK GEARED TOWARDS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE SEE. THE VALUE OF PARTICIPATION- THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR INPUT WAS HEARD INCORPORATED AND MOVE THE NEEDLE AND THAT'S I THINK A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF WHAT OF A CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. SMALL THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SHOULD ENCOMPASS- I ALSO THINK THERE IS. PRIOR TO OUR TIME AN APPOINTMENT ON THE BOARD- THE- NEW BUDGET SUMMARY FOR PARENTS- IS AIMED AT- SIR STREAMLINING WHAT IS- SERVE UNPACKED FOR PARENTS IN PARTICULAR SO THAT WE- WE SAW A BALLOONING OF- SORT OF THE LENGTH OF EL CAP TO THE LOCAL LEVEL- IN MY- HOME SCHOOL DISTRICT OF LAUSD- AT A CERTAIN POINT IT WAS ALMOST THREE HUNDRED PAGES- AND IT'S- IT'S- REASONABLE TO EXPECT. THAT PARENTS SHOULD DECIDE FOR ALL OF OUR SECONDS AND- YOU KNOW GOBBLEDYGOOK OF ACRONYMS ENOUGH THAT SUIT. TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING AND SO THE BUDGET SUMMARY FOR PARENTS I THINK IS AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT FOR THAT AND TO. SPEAK PLAINLY ABOUT HOW THIS IS SHAPING. OPERATE FOR THEIR CHILDREN- IS WHAT WE DROPPED IT IN JANUARY PERFECT I'D I DON'T THINK SO BUT ARE WE DONE NO. I THINK- IT IS VERY VERY MUCH MY ASPIRATION AND I THINK THAT'S VERSION OF MANY MEMBERS OF THE BOARD TO CONTINUE. TO ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK- AND ALSO ITERATE IN THE FUTURE TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS IS A ROBUST A PROCESSES POSSIBLE AND THAT LOCAL DECISION MAKERS HAVE THE BENEFIT OF KNOWING FROM PARENTS FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT. WELL I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR FOCUS YOU CONTINUED FOCUS ON THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO. CERTAINLY ALL OF US IN THIS BUILDING AND AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING THE CONFIRMATION OF THE PERPETRATOR THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM- GAME CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT POINT A REAPPOINTMENT DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BUT I APPRECIATE THE FACT YOU MENTION SO CALLED SOCIAL EQUITY. BECAUSE THIS IS BY THE BASS BEST PATHWAY. IN EVERY SHARED UP. THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF DEFICIENCIES IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM I REALLY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION. AND I THINK WE AGREED A LOT OF STUFF IN PARTICULAR APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION. I FEEL LIKE WE ALL DO NOT FOR THE COMMUNITY- SO WITH THAT AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS EXPECT TO. SUPPORT YOUR NOMINATION TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES THANK YOU I THINK THAT THE US SENATE TO ROCKLAND SENATOR WILL JUST COVERED ALL OF MY QUESTIONS. MOST IMPRESSED HIM PRESSURES AND PRESS THEM. FROM BOTH OF YOU IS A COMMITMENT TO HAVE THEIR SAY REAL- INTERACTIVE THOUGHT PROCESS WITH YOUR STAKEHOLDERS. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BOTH BEEN VERY HIGH ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENT PARTICIPATION IN THANK YOU FOR THAT DISCUSSION AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO VENT ON CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE. IN THERE BOTH VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT I MADE A POINT THAT I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF VOUCHERS I THINK THAT WE CANNOT TAKE. MONEY FROM OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT WE CAN MAKE PUBLIC SCHOOL SAM OF MORE MORE- I THINK BLACK CIVIL IN TERMS OF THE KIDS. ARE THAT NEED OF THOSE LITTLE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS AND YOU KNOW AND I BELIEVE THAT CHARTERS PROVIDE THAT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. YOUR BACKGROUNDS ARE SO IMPRESSIVE MUSCLES THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU. AID TO THIS MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITY IN OUR STATE FOR PRESS OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS SO YEAH MY **** PARTY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO. ON THAT COMPETITION A HAND I WILL. BE OF AT ANY TIME AND WE NEED CONVERSE. SO THANK YOU BOTH. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR MINING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THAT MY CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU BOTH SEN THANKS FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE THE STATE BRINGING YEAR RESPECTIVE EXPERIENCE- AND TALENTS TO THE SERVICE OF OUR STATE I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOUR FAMILIES FOR THEIR SUPPORT. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE SURE THEY KNOW THEY'RE GETTING INTO. BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THEIR THEIR ROLE AS PARTNERS IN THIS- I ENJOYED MY OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH EACH OF YOU. ALTHOUGH BRIEFLY. IN OUR COLD OFFICES THIS MORNING- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO THE SAME. SYSTEM BUT ON A SERIOUS NOTE FROM. WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME. ETHNIC STUDIES AND SOME RECENT CHALLENGES OF EITHER POOR MCCUE COMMUNICATION LACK OF- INCLUSION JUST KIND OF YOUR THOUGHT SON NOT ONLY HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AS A STATE BUT- IN YOUR OWN VIEWS BY ETHNIC STUDIES IS IMPORTANT IN A STATE AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA THE KIND OF RELATED TO THAT ALTHOUGH. A SEPARATE AREA BUT HOW WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR FOCUS ON EARLY EDUCATION- AND RECOGNIZING PARTICULAR NEEDS THAT MIGHT MANIFEST AMONG PARTICULARLY YOUNG CHILDREN SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER SO. AND YOU WANNA LEAD ON IN WILL FOLLOW WITH MISTER NOVEL THANKS- SIR- FIRST ON ETHNIC STUDIES. THE FIRST PIECE I THINK- I THINK THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM IS GOING TO BE QUITE IMPORTANT- TO ARE INCREASINGLY DIVERSE- SCHOOL CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE AND HAVING CHILDREN BE ABLE TO SEE THEMSELVES IN THE HISTORY. AND THE SORT OF CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HAVE BUILT- THE POWER HOUSE THAT IS OUR HOME STATE- IS REALLY SOMETHING- THAT THAT CAN BE- SORT OF CABIN REALLY- THERE ARE CHAPTERS THAT I THINK WILL BE UNCONTROVERSIAL ABOUT- THE FARMWORKERS ABOUT THE SUFFRAGETTE MOVEMENT ABOUT- THE AT CHINESE- RAILROAD- AT BUILDING. AND CONTRIBUTIONS ACROSS- MANY SORT OF SEGMENTS OF A OUR CALIFORNIA HISTORY BUT ALSO OUR NATIONAL HISTORY. AND I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK THE PROCESS FOR THE ETHNIC STUDIES- ADOPTION HAS BEEN A LITTLE FADED- TO SAY THE LEAST- AND I THINK THERE ARE ALSO MECHANISMS THAT WERE ALREADY UNDERTAKING- TO CREATE A BETTER PROCESS- ON. A SERVE ON THE SCREENING COMMITTEE FOR THE STATE BOARD- FOR APPOINTMENTS TO THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN VETTING FOR- IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A SPIRIT OF INCLUSION- A SPIRIT OF OPENNESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT- WE ASKED ALL THE CANDIDATES WAS. ON TO DESCRIBE A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE HAPPENED TO WORK WELL UNDER PUT IDEA JEEZ AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY DONE SO CONSTRUCTIVELY WE WERE JOKING AT LUNCH WITH THE THAT. I'M. AT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A GOOD COMPROMISE WITH. EVERYONE A LITTLE BIT UPSET AND TO SELECT PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT ASSUMPTION THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SORT OF RULE BY FIAT AND HAVE IT ONLY EXPRESS ONE VIEWPOINT BUT BE SOMETHING THAT SIX MILLION SCHOOL CHILDREN CAN SEE THEMSELVES IN. AFTER ONE OF. STERN I THINK CAN DIRECTLY JOB OF BRING THAT BRING SOME CLARITY TO THAT OF THE COMPLEXITY AROUND ETHNIC STUDIES IN MY MIND IS IT A REFLECTION OF THE QUALITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE OF THE POSITION IN THE VISOR COMMITTEE IT'S OBVIOUSLY A- REFLECTION OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUE. BECAUSE WE'RE SUCH A DIVERSE STATE WHEN YOU TRY TO TAKE A LEGISLATION THAT LEADS TO LAWS THAT LEADS TO FRAMEWORKS THAT LEADS TO MODEL CURRICULUM AND YOU HAVE TO ATTEND TO STATUTES AND GUIDELINES AND YOU'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE THE BREADTH OF WHAT THE STATE REPRESENTS AND BRING IT INTO A CONCERTED DIFFICULT. I THINK THAT- GOING FORWARD THERE'S BEEN A VESTED INTEREST AND PARTNERSHIP OR THAT DIFFERENT THAN THE ORIGINAL KIM AND I WERE NOT PART OF THE REGION. STAY AND RISK. GOING FOR THIS ONE CAN AS MENTIONED ALREADY VETTING- THE PARTICIPANTS OF THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE SO THAT. NUMBER ONE THEY THEY CAN WORK WITH OTHERS HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND NUMBER TWO THEIR OPINIONS AREN'T THE OPINION OF THAT REPRESENTS THE- QUALITY OF THE STATE THE DIVERSITY THE STATE- TO- WORKING HANDS THAT THE VISOR COMMITTEE IS CLEAR. ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OR ASKING THEM TO DO- AND THE LIMITATIONS THEY HAVE BETTER WITHIN STATUTE. AND THEN THREE. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SOMEBODY ON THIS- ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT IS CLEARLY THE LEAD THAT CAN GUIDE THIS WORK AND HELP MAKE DECISIONS FOR THE ADVISORY GROUP- THAT ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH WHAT HE HE U. S. SENATORS ENVISIONED WHEN WE EMBARKED ON THIS IDEA. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LEARNING FROM OTHER DISTRICTS WHO HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS WORK SO- GOING FORWARD I CLEARLY SEE GREATER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT- GREATER FEEDBACK FROM PARENTS AND STUDENTS ABOUT WHAT THE VALUE AND WHAT THEY NEED TO HAVE OR WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AND THEN ALSO LEARN FROM THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HONEST. QUITE LONGER THAN HALF HEARTEDLY DESIGN ETHNIC STUDIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS OUT OF THE- HIGHER THEY MAKE IT WORK WITH A THREE JEEZ. I BELIEVE GOING FOR THE CLEAR- CLEAR DIRECTION THAT WILL MAKE SURE WE GET. EARLY IN SHALL EDUCATION FOR SURE I THINK THE KEY IS THE KEY IS GIVING ACCESS. OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS IS WHY I CAME WHY WANT TO VOLUNTEER HERE. AND THAT'S THE ROLE OF THE STATE- POLITICS CAN'T LEAD THE WAY. OUR OUR GOAL AS A STATUS TO CREATE OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH A CHARTER SCHOOL OR THROUGH PUBLIC SCHOOL. IN EARLY EARLY AND- THAT'S THE MISSING INGREDIENT. EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS- EARLY EDUCATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY GAP GETS BIGGER OF REALLY QUICK KIM WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER THE EXPERT THERE. AND AS A SUPERINTENDENT ONE I CAN OFFER IS THAT OUR OUR GOAL WITH OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM NOT ONLY GIVE THEM. IT WOULD BE TO CREATE OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS AND KLAY EDUCATION. GIVEN THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. AND SIR ONE OF THE STUDIES THAT CAME OUT THAT I FOUND JUST VERY STARTLING LAST YEAR. ALSO WAS FROM THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE AND IT WAS. LOOKING AT- CALIFORNIA'S SUPPOSED TO- OTHER STATES AROUND THE NATION IN TERMS OF STANDARDIZED TESTS- AND WHAT IT CONCLUDED WAS THAT ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY. DOING PRETTY WELL THIRTY YEAR- THAT ARE AN ANNUAL PROGRESS AND RATES OF CHANGE THE DELTA ESSENTIALLY- IS PRETTY GOOD AND IN FACT IS EVEN OUTPACING SOME OTHER- SIMILARLY SITUATED LARGE STATES. WHERE WE FALL DOWN IS THAT AN VERY FOR SURE OF STANDARDIZED TESTING IN THIRD GRADE OUR KIDS ARE COMING IN FROM BEHIND- AND PARTICULARLY OUR- OUR TARGET POPULATIONS UNDER L. CFF- LOW INCOME CHILDREN- FOSTER KIDS. AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS NOT ONLY START FROM BEHIND BUT ALSO SEE THAT GAP WIDENED YEAR AFTER YEAR- AND SO THERE'S A GAME OF CATCH UP THAT WE ARE ASKING. OCEAN TO LAY OUT. THE DATA IS TELLING US CONSISTENTLY THAT WE ARE NOT SET UP TO BE- THE BESTER MEDIATORS IN IN THE COUNTRY WE ARE SET UP TO ACTUALLY HELP CHILDREN. I HAVE AND DO SO FROM THE BEGINNING. AT EVER. FOURTEEN IS ACCESS. BODY THERE SOME JOG WERE FOUR YEAR OLDS THREE YEAR OLD TO YOUR AND HOW ACCESS TO REALLY LEARN AND SORT OF APPROACH TO LEARNING THAT SAID SOME UP TO SUCCEED IN K. TO TWELVE AND SOME DO NOT- SO IN IN LINE WITH FLASHERS BUDGET THAT WAS- AND ACTED THERE IS A- UP FOR COMING. MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ANNOUNCED THAT WILL BE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS AND OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN IS MODELED AFTER THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER ED- I DON'T THINK THE GOAL BE FOR- THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DELIVER ALL PROGRAMS WERE MIXED DELIVERY STATE IN TERMS OF EARLY LEARNING AND I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SOMETHING THAT HONORS HOW PARENTS CHOOSE FOR THEIR FRIEND TO BE TICKETED AND SOME HOME BASE SETTINGS SOME. CARE SOME CENTER REYES SUMS TO. BUT THE NUMBERS ARE THE ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA EDUCATE AS MANY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS AS THERE ARE ELEVENTH GRADERS- AND YET THEY ARE THEY ARE LARGELY AN AFTERTHOUGHT IN TERMS OF SCHOOL AND ELLIE A LEVEL PLANNING- AND SO IF WE CAN BRING THOSE SYSTEMS TOGETHER IF WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THEM A PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING EFFORTS HERE AT THE STATE BOARD- AND ALSO PROVOKE A CONVERSATION- MORE BROADLY. ABOUT HOW THEY ARE INTEGRATED AND HOW THOSE TRANSITIONS WORK I THINK WE COULD- MAKE SIZEABLE ON ADVANCES IN THIRD GRADE READING MATH- AND THEN HAVE THAT CARRY OUT THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THEIR- K. TWELVE CAREER. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AGAIN- THANK CALIFORNIA'S FORTUNATE TO HAVE YOU BOTH WILLING TO. IN ESSENCE VOLUNTEER YOUR EXT PIECE TO HELP. I THE LEADERSHIP ON THE PART EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR YOU MADAM CHAIR. WITH A YOU VERY MUCH I AM GONNA GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND ASK IF THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE IN SUPPORT OF.

I'VE BEEN ON THE SINCE LAST EIGHT LEARNING A LOT AND TO REALLY HAVE FOUND THAT- THE WHAT I HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO IN MY YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE WHICH IS- DUE PROCESS GOOD GOVERNANCE- THAT THIS ROLE REALLY AFFORDS ME THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE IN THAT COMPLETELY SEPARATELY- FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND WE PROVIDE THAT VERY IMPORTANT CHECK AND BALANCE FUNCTION- FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHERE THE APPEAL CAN BE MADE OUT TO US AS A SEPARATE ENTITY. FROM THE IN ITSELF AND SO I THINK OUR PURSUIT- AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED AND CONTINUE TO LEARN AND I'M ENJOYING AND- IN THIS ROLE IS THE- ABILITY AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE WANT TO WORK TOWARDS GREATER COMPLIANCE FOR BETTER BUSINESS FIRE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN. VIOLATING THEIR LIE THAT IS WHEN WE TEND TO SEE THEM BECAUSE THEY THEN APPEAL. A RULING FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE- AND SO I THINK WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO BE- A CHECK AND BALANCE UPON THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- LICENSEE TO FEEL THAT THEY ARE GETTING THEIR DUE PROCESS- AND THAT THEY WILL BE HEARD IT BEFORE US BUT- ALSO- REALLY. MOVING TOWARDS A CULTURE WHERE COMPLIANCE IS OUR GOAL- ENFORCEMENT IS PART OF COMPLIANCE BUT WE REALLY DO WANT TO SEE OUR BUSINESSES- FUNCTIONING WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THEIR LICENSE- FOR THE BENEFIT OF BUSINESS FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AS WELL SO IT'S BEEN VERY FASCINATING I'VE FOUND IT- INTERESTING AND- A REALLY WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS AND WE'LL TRY TO ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF. MY ABILITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH LET ME START WITH YOU SENATOR MONNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- MS MONEY- WELCOME HOME.

FILING ITS WERE GETTING INTO WHATEVER CENTURY WERE IN NOW YOU KNOW AND- AND NOT EXPECTING EVERYONE HOPEFULLY. FIND STAMP AND MAIL ALL OF THEIR PAPERWORK TO US- WHICH IS THE CURRENT STATE AND SO- WE ARE HOPING TO HAVE THAT PLEASE BY THE WE- CONFERENCE CALLING.

REPRESENT THEMSELVES- AS WELL BUT WHEN YOU HAD ATTORNEY COMING- TO REPRESENT A CLIENT WE NOW WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY FOR THE ACTUAL LICENSEE IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO APPEAR OR TRAVEL TO THE HEARING COULD LISTEN IN- TO THE HEARING ITSELF. AND SO I FEEL THAT WE'RE MAKING SOME IMPORTANT STEPS BIRDS INCREASED ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE PUBLIC AND INCREASED TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE NOW- MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY HEAR WHAT WE'RE DOING. IN OUR APPEALS HEARINGS THREE WILL YOU SO MUCH AND I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS TIME AND AGAIN. BEFORE I THINK FOR YOUR CONTINUED. TO SERVER.
